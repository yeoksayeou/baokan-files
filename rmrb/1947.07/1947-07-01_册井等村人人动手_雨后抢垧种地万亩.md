　　Cejing and Other Villages Mobilize
　　to Rush Planting 10,000 Mu After Rain
　　[Report from this newspaper, Shahe] In mid-June, the Cejing area of ​​the second district and the Dukou area of ​​the first district of this county experienced several light rains one after another. Cejing Village only received two fingers' worth of rain, and there was no rain east of the village. Dukou only received three fingers' worth of rain. These villages, where the soil was semi-dry and not thoroughly wet, quickly launched a rush planting campaign. Initially, they dispelled the masses' concerns about wasting effort and not being able to plant. Li Laotan, a labor hero from Cejing, said: "Whether or not it sprouts is up to fate, whether or not we sow is up to us." Gao Dong said: "Planting offers hope; even if it doesn't grow, we won't regret it.” Thus, each village acted under slogans such as "Rather lose the seed than miss the season" and "Even a seedling is worth a third of the harvest." Dukou Village, led by labor hero Liu Qingyun, rushed to plant 825 mu in less than three days. Men and women in Cejing Village all pitched in, and all sixty businesses participated, planting more than 1,800 mu in one day. In Balimiao, in order to save more time during the rush planting, the Fan Guangen group and the Fan Yinbao group exchanged land plots with different plowing. This achieved a village-wide mutual aid effort. According to incomplete statistics from the four villages of Cejing, Dukou, Balimiao, and Beigou, a total of 12,985 mu were rushed to be planted. Around June 20th, another two or three fingers' worth of rain fell, and these seedlings all took root. (Kuí Lín)
　　[Report from this newspaper] Rain has fallen in various parts of the third district of Taigu County, and many places are organizing shock planting efforts. Villages such as Beisier, Shantou, and Xiaobeiling have already completed shock sowing. Recently, 53 head of livestock have been organized, along with armed labor-selling teams bringing their own farm tools and fodder, to support villages in border areas that lack labor and livestock and have suffered severe disasters. They are undertaking shock planting of labor-saving crops and have already arrived at their destinations. Morale for the shock planting is high, and the local masses are very welcoming.

　　册井等村人人动手
  　雨后抢垧种地万亩
    【本报沙河讯】六月中旬，本县二区册井和一区渡口一带，都先后下了几次小雨，册井村只下了二指雨，村东就没有下，渡口也只下了三指雨。这些半干土不湿的村庄便很快掀起了抢种运动，开始先打通了群众怕白费劲，不能种的思想顾虑，册井劳动英雄李老谈说：“出不出由他，耩不耧在咱。”高东的说：“种上就有指望，不出来也不后悔。于是各村便在“能叫丢了种，不叫搭了垧。”“见苗三分收”等口号下行动起来。渡口村在劳动英雄刘青云的带领下，不到三天就抢种了八百二十五亩。册井村男女人人动手，六十户商号都参加，一天就种了一千八百多亩。八里庙在抢种中为了更节省时间，范光恩组和范银保组互换耩不同地块的地。作到了全村大互助，根据册井、渡口、八里庙、北沟四村的不完全统计，前后共抢种了一万二千九百八十五亩。六月二十前后又下了二三指雨，这些苗都捉住了。（奎林）
    【本报讯】太谷三区各地均已落雨，多在组织突击抢种，自北寺儿、山头、小北岭等村，早已完成突击下种，最近组织劳畜力五十三犋，配合武装卖工队自带农具草料，支援边地劳畜力最缺乏和受灾重的村庄突击下种省工的作物，顷已到达目的地，突击下种情绪很高，当地群众很欢迎。
