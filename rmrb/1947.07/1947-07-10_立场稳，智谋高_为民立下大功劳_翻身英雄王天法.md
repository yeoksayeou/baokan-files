　　Steadfast Stance, High Intellect
  　Rendering Great Service to the People
  　Hero of Liberation, Wang Tianfa
    Xu Tianlin
    Comrade Wang Tianfa is the village chief of Xiyao Village, Sixth District of Gaoping. He worked as a shepherd and in coal mines for over twenty years since childhood. Before liberation his family suffered from hunger and hardship. Since the arrival of the Eighth Route Army in 1932, he has led the masses in liberation and established many achievements.

    Leading Workers to Increase Wages, Transforming Workers into Masters
    When the Eighth Route Army arrived, he recognized that the Eighth Route Army was working for the benefit of workers and peasants. He said to the workers in the coal mine, "We only earn half a liter of grain a day, which isn't enough to live on. We are working so hard, can we keep doing this!" The workers asked, "What do you think we should do?" He said, "To make things better, we must ask the boss to increase our wages." Under his leadership, more than one hundred workers in four kilns increased their wages from half a liter to three and a half liters. He also became a small foreman himself. With the victory of the wage increase, he worked even harder, and also helped the workers of Jingwanshang (a large kiln) to fight against the old local tyrant Yang Heiha. They demanded back wages and sent the tyrant to the county jail, transforming the kiln into the property of the workers, changing workers into masters.

    Cleverly Concealing Public Grain
    The county government stored more than two hundred *shi* of public grain in his village. When the situation became tight, the higher authorities ordered the grain to be hidden to prevent losses. The village cadres were at a loss. Comrade Tianfa said, "I have a solution." He prepared the people, hid the grain behind the kiln cave, and walled it up on the outside. After it dried a little, he built up some pickaxe marks with soil, just like the side of the kiln, making it difficult for people to discover. The public grain did not suffer any loss.

    Resolutely Completing Military Service Tasks
    From a small foreman, he became the leader of the farmers' association group, and then the deputy village chief. When the higher authorities assigned military service tasks, he completed one the first time, three the second time, and six the third time. Later, he completed ten more in three consecutive times, for a total of twenty-one new soldiers mobilized under his leadership.

    Never Discouraged, Even When Beaten
    Xiyao and Sanhuaizhuang were merged into one administrative village, with Comrade Tianfa as the village chief. Because of dispatching corvée labor, the village chief and the anti-corvée officer went to Sanhuaizhuang for a meeting. At that time, the cadres of Sanhuaizhuang were still controlled by bad people who exploited the opportunity to say that the anti-corvée officer was unfair in assigning labor. As a result, they blew out the lamp and dragged the village chief down to beat him up. After the beating, they also said, "Oh! Village chief! Did we hit you? You shouldn't have come, we made a mistake, village chief! Village chief, get up quickly." Comrade Tiansheng felt several bumps on his head, got up and said, "It's nothing! Let's assign the labor first. If everyone makes a mistake, they will know it themselves. As long as we do the work well, I'm fine."

    Although he suffered attacks from special agents, he was not discouraged in spirit, and resolutely led the masses of Sanhuaizhuang to liberate themselves, suppressing the special agents.

    Steadfast Stance, Not Susceptible to Bribery
    During the struggle in Xiyao, two special agent families wanted to send him some good food to bribe him. At that time, the village chief was not at home because he was at a meeting, and the family kept it. When the village chief came back, he asked, "Whose stuff is this?" The woman said, "It was sent by the families of Wang Hugen and Wang Tingwu." Comrade Tianfa thought that they wanted to bribe him, so he said to the woman, "In 1932, they wouldn't even give us bran. Why are they giving us buns and rolls today!" That night, he exposed this matter at a meeting of the farmers' association. Everyone discussed it and unanimously agreed that it was a loophole exploited by the landlords, and they immediately brought them up for struggle. As a result, they unearthed ninety taels of silver, fifty-two silver dollars, more than one hundred and forty pieces of clothing, and many other items.

    Elected as a Hero, Returning the Fruits
    He led the masses well in liberating themselves during the mass movement, and the masses supported him very much. At the large-scale liberation inspection meeting last October, he was elected as a liberation hero. He became even more active. When he returned to the village, he led the masses in completely cutting off the feudal tails in the filling-in movement, and voluntarily gave up three rooms of his liberated house.

    Obeying Transfer Orders to Help New Areas
    With the victory in Southern Shanxi and the consecutive capture of more than ten cities in Quwo and Jiangzhou, the higher authorities transferred cadres to work in the newly liberated areas. After talking with Comrade Tianfa, he happily said, "I want to go to the newly liberated areas to help the masses liberate themselves." He went home and packed his luggage and came to the county. The county said that he would have to go in a few days. He felt that it would be better to go sooner. When he came back, the masses asked him why he hadn't left. He replied, "I will be leaving in a few days. Now I am actively requesting to go to the newly liberated areas to help the peasants liberate themselves." (Transmitted from Gaoping "Dazhong Bao")

　　立场稳，智谋高
  　为民立下大功劳
  　翻身英雄王天法
    许天麟
    王天法同志是高平六区西瑶村长，从小放羊下煤窑共二十余年。从小家无吃喝，忍饥受饿，日子难过，到三十二年八路军来后，他领导群众翻身，建立下不少功绩。
    领导工人增资，由工人变主人
    八路军来了，他认识八路军是为工人农民谋利的，自己在煤窑里和工人们说：“咱一天赚升半米顾不住，使气搏力这还能干！”工人们问：“你说怎样好？”他说：“怎样好，得叫掌柜增资。”在他领导下，四个窑一百多工人，由升半增至三升半，自己又当了小工头，增资胜利了，劲更大，又帮助井湾上（大窑）工人和老恶霸杨黑孩斗争，要旧资把恶霸送县扣押，把窑算作为工人的，由工人变为主人。
    妙法埋藏公粮
    县府存放他村公粮二百余石，情况紧了，上级令埋藏不让损失。村干部没法，天法同志说：“有办法。”他把人准备好，把粮藏到窑洞后面，外面垒住，用泥糊好，稍干一些，用土筑上些钁印，和窑旁样子一样，使人不易发现，公粮没有遭受一点损失。
    坚决完成参军任务
    由小工头当了农会小组长，又当了副村长，上级布置了参军任务，头一次完成一个，二次完成三个，三次六个，后来又接着三次完成十个，总共在他领导下动员了二十一个新战士。
    打死也不灰心
    西瑶与三槐庄合并为一个行政村，天法同志任村长。因支差事，村长和抗勤到三槐庄开会。当时三槐庄干部仍是坏人掌握，钻空子说抗勤派差不公，结果把灯吹灭，把村长拉下来乱打一顿。打后还说：“呀！村长！打着你了没有？这才不该来，是打错了，村长！村长快起来。”天生同志摸摸头上打了几个圪塔，起来说：“没有甚！咱们先把差派好，大家打错了自家知道，只要把工作搞好，我没什么。”
    他虽然遭特务钻空打击，但在情绪上死不灰心，坚决领导三槐庄群众翻起身来，把特务压下去。
    立场坚定不受收买
    西瑶斗争中，有两家特务想做些好吃的送他收买。当时村长正开会不在家，家人留下了。村长回来问：“这东西是谁的”？女人说：“是王虎根、王廷武家送的”。天法同志想这是想收买我，就和女人说：“三十二年时和他要糠还不给，今天为甚给咱包子、卷子呢！”晚上农会开会他把这件事揭破。大家讨论，一致认为是地主钻空，马上提来就斗争。结果斗出银子九十两、现洋五十二块，衣服一百四十余件，其他物件很多。
    当选英雄退果实
    在群运中领导群众翻身好，群众很拥护，去年十月翻身大检查会上当选翻身英雄，自己更积极起来，回到村在填补运动中，领导群众彻底割掉封建尾巴，并将自己翻身房子自动让出三间。
    服从调动帮助新区
    晋南胜利，连续打下曲沃绛州十余座城，上级调干部到新解放区工作，和天法同志谈了一下，他很愉快的说：“我要去新解放区帮助群众翻身。”自己回到家里把行李收拾好到县里来，县里说要迟几天再去，心内感到不如早去才好，回来群众问他为什么没去，他回答说：“过几天我就要走，现在积极要求到新解放区帮助农民翻身。”（转自高平“大众报”）
