　　【Our Newspaper News】The second struggle organized in Pingding Chengguan was fierce and intense, overthrowing 49 despotic landlords including Zhou Kechang. After the first fruit distribution, the streets of Chengguan immediately reorganized their ranks, strengthened and expanded the Workers' and Peasants' Association, identified targets for struggle, and organized a second struggle. This time, leadership was completely handed over to the Workers' and Peasants' Association, allowing the broad masses of poor people to take action, with everything done by the masses. This brought into play the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, making the movement develop very fiercely and intensely. In a total of six or seven days, 49 despotic landlords including Zhou Kechang were overthrown. The masses recovered 2,117 mu of land, 467 shi of grain, 11,889 yuan in silver, 15,520 pieces of clothing, over 30 jin of silver ingots, and 28 taels of pure gold. They are currently distributing the fruits and preparing for the third struggle. During this struggle, when the cadres of the turn-over team discussed all work, they had to find members of the Standing Committee of the Workers' and Peasants' Association to participate, and nothing could be resolved without going through the Workers' and Peasants' Association. The turn-over teams, the armed forces, and all organizations, political power, etc., were all under the leadership of the Workers' and Peasants' Association. They presided over all meetings, large and small, and all matters, so the masses had the following reactions to the Workers' and Peasants' Association: "Democracy is given to us, we control the political power, and we must consider our words carefully in the future, and not be sloppy or perfunctory." The masses are masters of their own affairs, and their morale is high. When a group of women went to harvest the wheat planted by the landlords, they acted with confidence and righteousness. They recognized that they were harvesting their own wheat, and sang the songs of liberation of Pingding while harvesting, which was very pleasant. (Turn-over Report)
　　【Our Newspaper Taiyue Dispatch, 7th】Si Village, Southern Quwo, adopted the policy of conducting all struggles through the masses, and the movement developed extremely rapidly. After the village was re-liberated, the masses were concerned about "the change of heaven." After the members of the returning Farmers' Association introduced the experience of reversing the counter-settlement in other places, the masses spontaneously organized. Among the 165 households in the village, 119 households participated in the Farmers' Association, forming a huge force. In addition to detaining the targets of struggle in the village, they also sent militiamen to Wanquan to capture the fleeing bullies. At this time, the leadership paid special attention to promoting democracy. Everything was done through the masses, and everything had to be approved by the masses before it could be handled. Once they were preparing to struggle against a big bully, the cadres suggested that the opinion should be fermented for two days before holding a general meeting, but the masses said: "The period when he exploited us was the period of fermentation." They demanded immediate struggle. Sure enough, as soon as the target of struggle was pulled into the field, the masses rushed in like a tide, suing and beating him, proving that the target was extremely sinful. The masses were always preparing to struggle, and once their ideological concerns were lifted, they would immediately take action.

  　七天斗倒大奸霸
  　平定城关第二次斗争胜利
    【本报讯】平定城关组织二次斗争，猛烈紧张，斗倒奸霸地主周克昌等四十九个。城关各街在一次果实分配后，紧接着整顿了自己的阵容，健全与壮大了工农会，找出斗争对象，组织了二次斗争。此次在领导上完全放权给工农会，让广大贫苦群众行动起来，一切由群众去干，这样发挥了群众的积极性与创造性，使运动发展的非常猛烈非常紧张。总共六、七天的时间，计共斗倒奸霸地主周克昌等四十九个，群众收回土地二千一百一十七亩，粮食四百六十七石，现洋一万一千八百八十九元，衣服一万五千五百廿件，元宝三十余斤，赤金二十八两，现正分配果实，准备与进行第三次斗争。此次斗争中，翻身队干部在讨论一切工作时，必须找工农会常委参加，一切事情非通过工农会解决不了问题。翻身小组、武装及一切组织、政权等都是在工农会领导下，大小会大小事，都是他们主持，所以群众对工农会有以下的反映：“民主给了咱，政权咱掌握，以后说话必须要考虑，不能马虎与应付”。群众自己当家，气势雄壮；一批妇女去收割地主种的麦子时，在行动上表现理直气壮，他们认识这是收自己的麦子，一边割一边唱着解放平定歌曲，十分愉快。（翻身报）
    【本报太岳七日电】曲沃南属寺村采取一切斗争通过群众的方针，运动开展极为迅速。该村群众于重新解放后曾有“变天”顾虑，经回村农会会员介绍其他各地反倒算经验后，群众便自动组织起来。全村一百六十五户中，即有一百一十九户参加了农会，形成了巨大势力。除把村里的斗争对象都扣起来，还派民兵去万泉捕捉逃亡的恶霸。此时领导上特别注意发扬民主，一切通过群众，一切必经群众批准才能处理。某次准备斗争一个大恶霸，干部意见还须经两天酝酿再开大会，而群众却说：“他剥削我们的时期，就是酝酿的时期”，要求马上斗争，果然一将斗争对象拉进场，群众便如潮水似的一拥而来，又诉又打，证明罪大恶极的对象，群众时时都在准备斗争，一旦思想顾虑解除，即会立即行动起来。
