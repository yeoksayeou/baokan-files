International Commentary
    Two Major Difficulties for American Imperialism
    American imperialism is currently facing two major difficulties: the growing economic crisis and the surging democratic movement against the Truman government.
    At present, various signs of the American economic crisis have become increasingly apparent, manifested in the following: First, warehouses are filled with inventory, reaching 36 billion yuan at the end of last year, significantly indicating the decline of the domestic market. This year, due to soaring prices, consumer goods prices alone increased by 56.3 percent from February 15th to March 10th. Workers' real wages have been greatly reduced, purchasing power has declined, and it is estimated that inventory will increase by at least 12 billion yuan. Second, stock market transactions are sluggish, fully reflecting capitalists' fear and loss of confidence in the economic outlook. Third, exports have sharply decreased. The U.S. Department of Commerce has already issued warnings. Originally, in the eyes of American monopoly capitalists, expanding overseas markets and exporting abroad were the only magic weapons for the United States to escape the crisis. However, recently, capitalist countries (South America, Canada, New Zealand, and Western European countries) have experienced severe dollar crises. This depletion of dollars and gold has seriously impacted American export trade. Fourth, production has begun to shrink, with industrial output reducing by 3-4 percent from March to May. Fifth, the number of unemployed has increased. To date, the number of unemployed is close to six million, and a large number of the underemployed have not yet been included.
    This increasingly imminent economic crisis in the United States has made even representatives of the American bourgeoisie panic and cry out. Truman issued ineffective appeals for automatic price reductions. Former Price Control Administrator Bowles, a representative of the moderate faction of the American bourgeoisie, warned in mid-May that a small-scale economic recession was "imminent," and that a Great Depression like that of 1929 would be unavoidable if not prevented early. Former U.S. Vice President Wallace also demanded that the reaction of American big capital be curbed to prevent a "panic even more serious than that of 1929."
    The domestic political difficulties of American imperialism are also developing. As a result of the American reactionaries' high-handed suppression of labor democracy at home and their implementation of aggression abroad, a nationwide anti-labor, anti-democracy, and anti-Trumanism movement has erupted, promoting the development of a third-party movement. Labor circles and democrats have protested against the recently passed Taft-Hartley anti-labor bill. Before the passage of the bill, the two major U.S. labor unions, the AFL and the CIO, held demonstrations of tens of thousands of people in New York one after another. After the passage of the bill, they launched protest strikes, refusing to recognize this "slave bill" cursed by American workers. Currently, this struggle is continuing to deepen.
    At the same time, after returning from his visit to Europe, Wallace conducted a national lecture tour in May and June. During this trip, Wallace had a clearer attitude towards the necessity of resolutely splitting with the reactionary faction of the Democratic Party and creating a third party. At the beginning of his national tour, he said that the purpose was to promote the leftward shift of the Democratic Party, but at the end of the tour, he said that he would "restore the two-party system by other means" (note: Wallace referred to the two-party system of the Democratic and Republican parties this spring as a "deceptive one-party system disguised under the guise of a two-party group"). This implied his determination to engage in the organization of a third party. The Council of the Progressive Citizens of America recently pointed out clearly in its resolution that it was necessary to organize a new party and to consider organizing a third party. The Progressive Citizens of America is a joint organization of American labor, Democratic Party democrats, and progressives, and it is also the ideal foundation for a third party. Its resolution deserves attention. It is estimated that the development of the third-party movement will be faster than generally expected. It may be formed before next year's election to lead the American people in their struggle for democracy and peace.

            Four-Power Relations
    The U.S. imperialist policy of foreign expansion has invited a worldwide anti-Trumanism wave, forcing Truman's arrogant so-called "crusade against communism" to become obscure and to be rebranded. The Marshall Plan emerged on June 5th. This plan aims to control the politics and economy of European countries through aid, interfering in the internal affairs of these countries, causing them to lose their sovereign independence, and become vassals of U.S. imperialism under the guise of aiding the economic recovery of the entire Europe. The senior American representative in Paris has partially revealed this secret, solemnly stating: "The Marshall Plan cannot be regarded as a lend-lease bill in peacetime. The United States will propose conditions for granting loans to European countries."
    Unlike in the past, during this period, American imperialism took advantage of Britain's economic difficulties and tried its best to win over the British and French governments to act as tools for its expansion, implementing the Marshall Plan through them. Shortly after the Marshall Plan was announced, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Clayton rushed to London and Paris to lobby and conduct a series of activities. As far as the British and French ruling authorities are concerned, they are currently mired in the suffering of poverty and scarcity, so they also want to use American assistance to break free from the shackles of economic difficulties. At the same time, they "attempt to act as American agents in European affairs, becoming slave stewards for their American masters" (Soviet New Times commentary). The reactionary faction of the British and French upper classes, represented by Churchill, is taking the opportunity to fuel the flames, fantasizing about forming the "Western European Federation" that they have long dreamed of.
    At the behest of the United States, Britain and France, especially Britain, have been so active in advance, preparing a complete set of traps, arranging a Paris Three Foreign Ministers Conference of the Soviet Union, Britain, and France that must be split, forcing the Soviet Union to withdraw from the so-called European Economic Recovery Conference, in order to implement the Marshall Plan as they please.
    The Soviet Union has taken a firm stance of struggle against this expansion policy of U.S. imperialism that infringes upon other countries. At the Paris Three Foreign Ministers Conference, Molotov ruthlessly exposed the tricks of the Marshall Plan and the collusion of Britain and France in obeying the United States, resolutely rejecting the all-encompassing so-called "European Recovery Plan" proposed by Britain and France, which attempted to control the economy and internal affairs of European countries.
    As far as the current situation is concerned, due to the pull of the United States using the difficulties of Britain and France, it seems on the surface that Britain and France are singing in harmony with the United States. However, the facts are not so simple. This temporary situation should never be regarded as a basic contradiction between Britain and France, especially Britain, and the United States tending to ease or even be resolved. Because on the one hand, American aid cannot solve the economic difficulties of Britain and France, especially Britain, let alone the fact that the small favors of the United States are always just a deceptive trap! Even the "Economist" weekly of the British Conservative Party has revealed this inner anxiety and fear. The weekly recently declared: "Britain has neither the right nor the reason to make up for its deficits entirely or mainly through the new saying of mutual aid or any route of the Marshall Plan." It even shouted: "To build British policy on the assumption that the United States is willing to solve the British economic problem is a bad example for the British people and countries in a situation that is at least as serious as my own." On the other hand, the blade of the U.S. imperialist expansion policy and the Marshall Plan is first directed at Britain, France, and their spheres of influence. How far apart is this from the desire of Britain and France to take advantage of the agent status of American aid to profit! Therefore, the development of events will cause the potential contradictions between Britain, France, and the United States, especially Britain and the United States, to erupt more fiercely. Therefore, the correct path to truly solve the post-war economic recovery is not to rely on the "aid" of imperialism with a strong desire for aggression, but to develop economic relations based on mutual benefit and equality. At present, eight countries, including South, Czech, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, have taken this path. On the one hand, they resolutely refused to participate in the so-called "European Recovery Conference" manipulated by the United States, Britain, and France. At the same time, these countries signed agreements on economic and trade cooperation and cultural exchange with each other and with the Soviet Union to adjust surpluses and shortages and obtain mutual assistance. At present, the outstanding achievements of these countries in economic recovery work prove that this path is the only hope to guide the country towards economic recovery and a happy life.

            The Prosperity of the Soviet Union and Southeast Europe
    While economic panic is lurking like a ghost in the capitalist world, a picture of economic prosperity and booming is emerging in the socialist Soviet Union and the newly democratic countries of Southeast Europe. In the Soviet Union, the post-war five-year plan is proceeding smoothly. Following the completion of the first quarter plan this year, the Soviet people have successfully completed and exceeded the second quarter plan. The total industrial production has increased sharply by about 20 percent compared with the same quarter last year. In agriculture, the spring plowing plan has been completed, and the cultivated area of crops has increased by about 8 million hectares compared with last year. The whole country is celebrating this year's bumper harvest, and various places are conducting competitions to complete the harvesting plan ahead of schedule. Southeast European countries such as Czech, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, South, etc., have successively formulated plans for economic recovery and development, and are implementing them smoothly. Industrial and agricultural production in Czech, Bulgaria, South, etc., has increased sharply. New York Nation magazine reporter Penrose praised the economic development of Southeast Europe and pointed out: "Without American aid, the economic recovery of Southeast Europe is still continuing." At the same time, these countries, such as Hungary and Bulgaria, have carried out political purges, suppressed the conspiracies of armed coups instigated by U.S. imperialism, and made the new democratic regimes more consolidated, thereby ensuring the reliable progress of the economic recovery plans of these countries.

            Political Crisis in France and Italy
    One of the important events in Western Europe at present is the growing political crisis in France and Italy.
    Under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, France and Italy saw the emergence of governments without Communist participation for the first time since the liberation of the two countries in May. At that time, the reactionaries were complacent, thinking that they could restore the old order from then on and cancel the democratization of these two countries. However, the result of the development of events in the past two months is just the opposite. The nationwide struggle of the French working class against the Ramadier reactionary government and the demand for wage increases, which has continued from the end of April to the present, and the growing movement against the one-party dictatorship of Gasperi throughout Italy, have made the political foundation of the current French and Italian authorities increasingly fragile, and the political and economic situation of the countries is deteriorating.
    In France, Ramadier's economic policy, which only seeks the interests of big capital, recently (4th) received extremely miserable majority support from the National Assembly and the national congress (7th) of the Socialist Party to which he belongs. As a reaction to the mood of the French people, the Federation of Government Employees, which has 1.2 million members, issued an ultimatum to him, asking him to accept all the workers' demands, otherwise a general strike would be held. This move has received enthusiastic sympathy from workers in other industries. On the other hand, the call for restoring the position of the French Communist Party in the cabinet is spreading throughout the country for the benefit of France.
    The situation in Italy is also the same. The events of the past year indicate that as a result of Gasperi's use of his government position to squeeze out the members of the Social and Communist parties and delay the democratic reform of the country, his Christian Democratic Party has been repeatedly rejected by the people in the municipal elections last autumn and the trade union elections this spring. Now, under the "one-party" dictatorship, Gasperi is even more isolated. The "Front for the Defense of Free Republic," which includes six parties, including the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Italian Labor Party, the Action Party, the Republican Party, and the Labor Democratic Party, has become the banner of the great unity of the democratic forces in Italy. Among them, especially the influence of the Social and Communist parties among the people is growing rapidly.
    The serious and urgent problem facing France and Italy today is still the issue of national economic recovery. According to the experience of various countries after the war, the solution to this problem is certainly impossible without the democratization of the country and the participation and leadership of the French Communist Party, which has more than 2 million members and is supported by more than 5 million voters, and the Italian Socialist Party and the Communist Party, which have 3 million members and are supported by 6 million trade union members.

    国际述评
    美国帝国主义的两大困难
    现在美国帝国主义正面临着两大困难，即经济危机的日益迫近与反杜鲁门政府的民主运动的风起云涌。
    目前，美国经济危机的各种征象已日益明显，这表现在：第一，仓库堆满存货，去年年底已达三百六十亿元，显著表现国内市场的衰颓。今年由于物价高涨，仅自二月十五到三月十日，消费品价格即涨了百分之五十六点三，工人实质工资大减，购买力下降，估计存货量至少将增加一百二十亿元。第二，股票交易萎靡不振，充分反映了资本家们对经济前途的恐惧与丧失信心。第三，出口锐减，美国商务部这时已发出了警告，本来在美国垄断资本家们看来，扩大海外市场与对外输出，是美国借以逃避危机的唯一法宝，但是最近资本主义国家（南美、加拿大、纽西兰、西欧各国）已爆发了深重的美元危机。这一美元与黄金的枯竭，严重打击了美国的出口贸易，第四，生产开始萎缩，工业产量自三月至五月已缩减百分之三四。第五，失业人数增长，迄今失业者已近六百万，而极大数量的半者尚未计算在内。
    美国这一日益迫近的经济危机，使美国资产阶级的代表也不能不惊惶呼号，杜鲁门发出了毫无效果的自动减价的呼吁。美国资产阶级中派的代表前物价管制局局长鲍尔斯，在五月中旬更发出警告说，小规模的经济萧条已“迫在眼前”，一九二九年式的大恐慌如不及早预防，势将不可避免。美前付总统华莱士亦要求制止美国大资本的反动，以防止“比一九二九年式更严重的恐慌”。
    美国帝国主义国内的政治困难亦正在发展中。由于美国反动派对内反对劳工的高压民主，对外实行侵略的结果，爆发了全国性的反反劳工、反反民主与反杜鲁门主义运动。并促进了第三党运动的发展。劳工界和民主人士纷对新近通过的塔虎脱——哈特莱的反劳工法案提出抗议。美两大工会劳联和产联在该案通过之前，先后在纽约召开了几万人的示威大会。在该案通过之后，又发动了抗议罢工，不承认这一美国劳工所咀咒的“奴役法案”。目前，这一斗争正在继续深入中。
    同时，华莱士从访欧归来之后，又在五、六月间作了一次全国讲演旅行。华氏在这次旅行中，对坚决和民主党反动派分裂和创立第三党之必要，有了更明确的态度。他在开始全国旅行时，还说目的在促使民主党左倾，但在结束旅行时便说要“以其他方法恢复两党制”，（按：华莱士于今春被民主党与共和党的两党制称之为“在两党集团伪装下骗人的一党制”）。暗示决心从事第三党的组织了。美国进步公民协会理事会最近在其决议中，明白指出要组织新党，要考虑组织第三党。进步公民协会是美国劳工、民主党民主派和进步人士的联合组织，也是第三党的理想基础，它的决议是值得重视的。据估计，第三党运动的发展比一般人预料要快，它可能在明年大选之前组成，来领导美国人民为争取民主和平而斗争。
            四强关系
    美帝国主义的对外扩张政策，招来了一个世界反杜鲁门主义的浪潮，迫使杜鲁门狂妄的所谓“对抗共产主义的十字军主义”的招牌为之晦涩，不得不改头换面，一个马歇尔计划随之于六月五日出现。这个计划是以援助整个欧洲的经济复兴为名，实际上则通过援助来控制欧洲各国的政治和经济，来干涉这些国家的内政，使之丧失主权上的独立性，成为美帝国主义的附庸。巴黎的美国高级代表已部分的泄露了这个秘密，郑重地说：“马歇尔计划不能看成是和平时期的租借法案，美国将提出其允准贷款给欧洲国家之条件。”
    和过去不同，在这一时期美帝国主义利用英国的经济困难，极力拉拢英法政府来充当其扩张的工具，通过他们来实行马歇尔计划。在马歇尔计划发表后不久，美副国务卿克莱敦便赶到伦敦、巴黎游说，进行了一连系的活动。就英法统治当局而言，它们目前正陷于贫困与匮乏的苦难中，因此它们亦想利用美国的帮助，借此挣脱经济困难的枷锁。同时，它们“企图充当美国在欧洲事务的代理人，成为美国主子的奴隶总管”。（苏新时代评语）英法上层反动一派，以邱吉尔为代表的更是趁机推波助浪，幻想借此组成那梦寐不忘的“西欧联邦”。
    在美国的授意下，英法特别是英国竟如此积极，预先制就了一整套圈套，布置了一个务使分裂的苏英法巴黎三外长会，迫使苏联退出所谓欧洲经济复兴会议，以便随心所欲的来实行马歇尔计划。
    苏联对于美帝国主义这种侵害他国的扩张政策，采取了坚决斗争的立场。莫洛托夫在巴黎三外长会议中，无情地揭露了马歇尔计划的骗术和英法顺从美国的勾当，毅然地拒绝了英法所提的企图控制欧洲各国经济与内政的包罗万象的所谓“欧洲复兴计划”。
    就目前的情况而言，由于美国利用英法的困难而施用的拉一把政策，使得在表面上似乎英法与美国唱酬很合拍，但事实并非如此简单，目前这种暂时的情况绝不能看成是英法特别是英国与美国之间的基本矛盾趋于缓和甚至解决了。因为一方面，美国的援助解决不了英法特别是英国的经济困难，何况美国的小恩小惠始终只是一个欺骗的圈套！甚至英国保守党的“经济学家”周刊亦道出了这种内心殷忧恐惧。该周刊最近宣称：“英国既无权利，也无理由全部或主要地经由互助的新说法或马歇尔计划的任何途径，来弥补其亏空。”甚至喊出：“将英国政策建立于美国愿意解决英国经济问题这一假定上，这对英国人民和情况至少和我自己同样严重的欧洲国家来说，都是一个坏例子。”另一方面，美帝国主义的扩张政策和马歇尔计划的刀锋，是首先指向英法及其势力范围，这和英法企图利用美国援助的代理人地位以获利的愿望，相距是如何遥远。因此事件的发展，势将英法美特别英美之间潜在的矛盾，更激烈的爆发出来。因此，能真正解决战后经济复兴的正确道路，不是依靠帝国主义具有强烈侵略欲的“援助”，而是基于互惠平等的经济关系的发展。目前南、捷、波、罗、保等八国便采取了这一道路，他们一方面毅然决然拒绝参加美英法操纵的所谓“欧洲复兴会议”，同时这些国家相互之间及与苏联之间订立了经济贸易合作与文化交流的协定，来调节有无，取得相互协助。目前这些国家经济复兴工作成绩的卓著，证明了这一道路才是引导国家走向经济复兴与幸福生活的唯一希望。
            苏联与东南欧的繁荣
    当经济恐慌象一个幽灵似的隐现在资本主义世界中时，在社会主义苏联和新民主主义的东南欧诸国，却出现了一幅经济蒸蒸日上与繁荣的图画。在苏联，战后复兴五年计划正顺利进行中，苏联人民继今年第一季计划完成后，又胜利完成并超过了第二季计划。工业生产总量，比去年同季激增百分之二十左右。在农业方面，春耕计划已完成，农作物的耕种面积比去年约增加八百万公顷。全国正喜庆今年的大丰收，各地正进行提前完成收割计划之竞赛。东南欧捷、波、罗、保、匈、南等新民主主义国家，都已先后制定复兴与发展经济的计划，并已顺利实施中。捷、保、南等国工农业生产激增。纽约民族杂志记者潘洛斯盛赞东南欧经济发展时指出：“没有美国的援助，东南欧经济的复兴，仍在继续进行。”同时，这些国家如匈、保等国，进行了政治的清洗，镇压了在美国帝国主义策动下武装政变的阴谋，使新民主政权愈形巩固，从而使这些国家经济复兴计划的进行，获得了可靠的保证。
            法意政治危机
    西欧目前的重要事件之一，就是法意两国政治危机的日趋严重。
    在美帝国主义策动下，法意在五月间先后出现了两国解放以来第一次没有共产党参加的政府，当时反动派曾洋洋得意，满以为从此可以恢复旧秩序，而取消这两国的民主化了。可是两个月事变发展的结果适正相反。从四月底开始，迄今一直持续着的法国工人阶级反对拉马第反动政府与要求增资的全国性斗争，和遍布意国全境的反对加斯贝利一党专政的日益增长的运动，已使目前法意当局的政治基础日益脆弱，国家的政治经济情势益趋恶化。
    在法国，拉马第的惟大资本利益是图的经济政策，最近（四日）在国民议会上和他所属的社会党的全国大会上（七日）获得右派极凄惨的多数支持之后；作为法国人民情绪的反应的，却紧接着拥有一百二十万会员的政府雇员联盟向其提出最后通牒，要他接受工人的全部要求，否则即行大罢工。这一举动，并得到其他各业工人的热烈同情。另方面，为了法国的利益，要求恢复法共内阁地位的呼声则遍布全国。
    意大利的情形亦复如是。过去一年的事变标示，由于加斯贝利利用其政府权位，排挤社共两党阁员，推延国家的民主改革结果，他的基督教民主党在去秋市选及今春工会选举中连连遭到人民的唾弃。现在在“一党”专政下，加斯贝利则更形孤立。包括共产党、社会党、意国劳动人民党、行动党、共和党及劳工民主党等六个政党的“保卫自由共和阵线”已成为意国民主力量大团结的旗帜。其中尤其是社共产党在人民中的影响，是迅速在增长着。
    今天摆在法意面前的严重而亟待解决的问题，仍是国民经济复兴问题。这一问题的解决，根据战后各国的经验，如没有国家的民主化，没有拥有二百余万党员受五百余万选民拥护的法国共产党，及拥有三百万党员受六百万工会会员支持的意国社会党、共产党的参与领导，是断然不可能的。
