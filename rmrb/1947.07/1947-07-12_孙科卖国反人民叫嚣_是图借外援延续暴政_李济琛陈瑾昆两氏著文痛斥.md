Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 7th: According to TASS, Nanjing, July 6th: General Li Jishen published a statement in the Hong Kong "Hua Shang Bao," calling on national democrats to rise up and thwart the Chiang Kai-shek government's attempt to "beg for foreign aid and colonize China." Li strongly criticized Sun Ke's statement on June 22, saying: "It is regrettable that Sun Ke, as the son of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, actually issued a statement that violates the wishes of the Chinese people; as the Vice President of the 'National Government,' he actually made remarks that damage China's independence and autonomy." Li criticized Sun Ke's remarks seeking assistance from the United States, saying: "These remarks not only harm national dignity but also intend to reduce China to a colony." Li continued: "Sun Ke is not an ordinary person, but the 'Vice President of the National Government.' Therefore, his opinions cannot be regarded as his personal opinions, but must be regarded as the opinions of the 'National Government.' From Sun Ke's remarks, it is very obvious that the 'National Government,' controlled by the dictatorial clique, wants to use the assistance of foreign forces to eliminate its opponents, enslave the people, and prolong its tyranny." Finally, Li called on Chinese democrats to rise up and thwart these attempts.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui Border Region, July 6th: The famous jurist Mr. Chen Jinkun recently wrote an article denouncing Sun Ke's clamor against the Soviet Union and the Communist Party, saying: Sun Ke's clamor is "completely crying out to the United States for help," and it is "exactly the same as Duan Qirui, Cao Kun, Wu Peifu, Zhang Zuolin, Wang Jingwei, and others shouting about preventing communism and the Soviet Union, just a pretext for colluding with foreign countries to maintain dictatorship."

    孙科卖国反人民叫嚣
    是图借外援延续暴政
    李济琛陈瑾昆两氏著文痛斥
    【新华社陕北七日电】据塔斯社南京六日讯：李济琛将军在香港华商报发表谈话，号召全国民主人士起来，粉碎蒋介石政府“乞求外国援助，使中国殖民地化”的企图。李氏猛烈抨击上月二十二日孙科的声明称：“令人遗憾的是：作为孙中山先生的儿子的孙科，居然发表违反中国人民愿望的声明；作为“国民政府”副主席的孙科，居然发表损害中国独立自主的谈话。”李氏责难孙科向美国求援的言论称：“这种言论不仅有碍国家尊严，而且意图降中国为殖民地。”李氏继称：“孙科不是平常人，而是‘国民政府副主席’，因此他的意见不能看做是他个人的意见，而必须看做是‘国民政府’的意见。从孙科的谈话中，很明显的可以看到为独裁集团所控制的‘国民政府’要借外国势力的援助，企图消灭其反对者并奴役人民、而延长其暴政。”最后，李氏号召中国民主人士起来，粉碎这些企图。
    【新华社晋绥六日电】名法学家陈瑾昆氏顷撰文痛斥孙科叫嚣反苏、反共称：孙科的叫嚣“完全是向美国喊救命，”它“完全和段祺瑞、曹琨、吴佩孚、张作霖、汪精卫等喊防共防苏一样，只是勾结外国维持独裁的一个口实。”
