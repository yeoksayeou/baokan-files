　　Southward Journey
    Fang De
    Along the arc from Tangyin to Yuncheng, crossing northern Henan, southern Hebei, and western Shandong, and bisecting the ancient and modern Yellow Rivers, one sees both new life and death:
    On the night of June 24th, traveling east along the Tang River north of Tangyin city, passing through Longhua Township, North and South Longhua, across the river, were the domains of bandits Han Changsheng and Wang Huaiming. Each planned to control several nearby villages as their territory, prohibiting mutual assistance and interaction between the people of the two areas. However, when they plundered resources, they forced the people under their rule to bring weapons and join their army to assist in battles in other areas, resorting to assassinations for "revenge" after defeats! Besides the internecine killings for external expansion, the bandits also carried out internal rule through slaughter. Two phrases were constantly on their lips: "We'll stuff you in a burlap sack and throw you into the Wei River!" or "Knock you off!"
    Such "small countries" carving up territory existed in four major forms in Tangyin County, and dozens more below them. This was a corner of China under Chiang Kai-shek's so-called unified military and political orders. When General Liu Bocheng's army passed through here on their westward march in March, the people wept and pleaded, "Don't leave!" General Liu responded to the people's request, finally liberating Tangyin on May 1st. The divided kingdoms and the slaughtering situation had already ended.
    One afternoon, entering Neihuang to the east, we stepped onto the old course of the Yellow River, an area known locally as the sandy region. The roadside was lined with jujube forests and pear orchards, interspersed with willow circles forming plots of sandy fields. After a light rain, people were planting sweet potatoes and sowing beans. As the army passed, the masses watched with smiling faces. At night, under the bright moon, there was a distinct feeling of cool autumn. Under the eaves along both sides of the roads in the villages and towns we passed through, the masses slept peacefully, bare-bellied and shirtless.
    Before dawn, crossing the Wei River, we stayed in Gaodi Village. The administrator assigned five of us to one courtyard. Entering the main gate, we saw an old lady sleeping there. Inside, only half of the main room remained, occupied by a strong young woman. Another kitchen room, barely large enough for an earthen kang, was there. The old lady gave up the main gate to two communications soldiers, while she and her daughter-in-law squeezed together. The three of us reporters had to sleep in the courtyard, unable to stretch our legs on a small patch of open ground. It was hot and crowded, barely managing until dawn.
    Later, I asked the old lady why there was no housing in a village of one hundred and fifty households. She said, "Our village never had many houses to begin with. Years ago, the Kuomintang army's 32nd Division passed through here, bringing back the Home Return Corps. They burned down more than two hundred rooms in one go, leaving the common people without housing. It's even harder when your army comes! You know, our village and the Central team are 'anti-pai,' relying on both sides of the Wei River to fight the grandsons for more than a year. They didn't dare to occupy us here. My son is in the gun squad, twenty-seven years old this year. Tomorrow he's going to the northwest village to capture the Home Return Corps!"
    When I stayed in Niantouji, Fourth District, I conducted a very meaningful investigation: This had been a guerrilla base area for five years. Land was only distributed after the wheat harvest this year. In just a few months, it had already accomplished these proud achievements: Five years ago, when the Chiang-Japanese puppet regime was in power, the whole village had only 234 households with 814 people. During land reform, those who had fled the famine returned, increasing sharply to 258 households with 977 people. Among them, 178 poor peasant households with 623 people had recovered 1,621.2 mu of land. The average amount of standard land per person in the whole village was 3.7 mu. Crops here are planted half wheat and half autumn crops. The wheat harvested by the masses this year amounted to 320 jin per person according to the old scale. They also used the fruits of the struggle to buy livestock. The whole village has increased from more than forty head to more than sixty. The chairman of the farmers' association, who led the emancipation, said with confidence, "Eliminating the long-standing barren land is not a problem." When Cao Chenxiang, a landlord and bandit leader lived here in the past, he openly demanded and secretly robbed, impoverishing the masses. He forced more than sixty young adults aged twenty to thirty-five to commit robbery and theft. However, Cao Chenxiang still wanted to "punish bandits," hoeing two peasants to death. At a meeting, emancipated farmer Yuan Tongwen said sadly and indignantly, "Old Wang and Old Chiang made it so that fathers couldn't feed their children and mothers couldn't feed their daughters. When we were starving, we had no choice but to steal and rob. In the end, they even used a guillotine to execute us. The old society was truly cannibalistic!" Besides this, the peasants also had to sell the bodies of their daughters and daughters-in-law. Six people have confessed and repented. When farmer Wu Lanmeng was allotted land and harvested wheat, he happily threw away the mud Bodhisattva at home. He said, "I believed in you for enough lifetimes without food to eat and no land to cultivate. Now I've only believed in Chairman Mao for a few days and I have land to cultivate and food to eat!" They have now escaped the suffering and shame of death, famine, robbery, theft, and prostitution, and have begun to build their own new society. Xia Laicheng said cheerfully, "The Communist Party not only provides people with food and clothing, but also leads people to learn good things!"
    One afternoon, we arrived at Hancunj, more than ten li east of Qingfeng. This was once the anti-Japanese guerrilla center of a certain district of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region. It was a large town of a thousand households. As soon as the army entered the village, a strong man climbed onto a three-zhang-high wooden platform in the center of the town with a loudspeaker and broadcast in all directions, "The troops have arrived! Send the boiled water to the broadcasting station, and carry the water tanks here." In less than a minute, people carrying water and tanks arrived one after another. The masses also asked cordially, "Comrades, are you tired? Rest and have some water!" Some explained like advertising promoters to win the chance to have their boiled water drunk, "Comrade! Drink my sweet grass water, you won't get sick after drinking it!" Some said, "Mine has added sour pomegranate, it's good for quenching thirst!" Some said, "Mine has added dates..." The old ladies, young wives, and lively young girls in the village also came out to pull the women comrades aside and ask about their lives. Who could say that this was not a picture of family reunion?!
    One night, we arrived at ××, thirty-five li east of Qingfeng. We were assigned to live in a courtyard. The landlady said angrily as soon as she saw us, "There's no place! If there was, would I be lying on the ground? Look at the kitchen room, take it or leave it, or go to another house!" After saying many good things, she reluctantly gave up two rooms for us to live in. The next day, the communications soldier Yang Laifu fetched water for her, made brooms, sharpened scissors, and chatted with her. The old lady became happy. She said, "Years ago, the Kuomintang captured my chickens and took away my winnowing basket. I hated them to the core. When I saw you at night, I was furious! I blame my old eyes for not recognizing that you are our own troops!" When we left after staying for two days, the old lady urged, "You must come in the door next time you pass by! Remember me, my name is Dai Laopo!"
    At half past ten on July 4th, during a lull in the aimless bombing and strafing by American-made Chiang planes, we crossed the Yellow River. A fast boat cut through the surging Yellow River waves, and the gentle breeze on both banks played with the clear sky and bright moon. After landing and traveling five li south, we crossed the Inner Embankment, and after traveling another twenty li south, we crossed the South Embankment. Both river embankments had fortifications dug for firing north, of varying sizes, new and old, as well as crisscrossing drainage ditches. The flood-prevention embankment was badly damaged. Judging by the construction of the strongholds and surrounding villages we passed through, it was enough to make people gasp. I asked more than a dozen guides, and they said, "We have been building fences for the Kuomintang team non-stop. It's been unspeakably hard! If your troops had crossed the river any later, the sorghum wouldn't have been planted. This area has been eating sorghum for a year and eight months. If it hadn't been planted, we'd be completely finished!"
    Along the way, I saw many places where the sorghum with ripening ears had been pulled out, some already dry and flammable, others still with some green. According to the guide, this was because the Home Return Corps had ordered it to be pulled out house by house, because "it was blocking the sight of the National Army."
    As the masses pulled it out, they looked back at the north bank of the Yellow River with tears in their eyes, while the demons of the Home Return Corps pointed guns at them and said, "What are you looking at?! Pull it out!" The villagers also replied angrily, "We're watching to see when the Eighth Route Army will come over?!"
    The People's Liberation Army crossed the river, saving the sorghum and saving the people in misery!

　　南下风云
    方德
    从汤阴到郓城这条弧形线上，穿过豫北、直南、鲁西、横截古今两道黄河，在这里看到新生，也看到了死亡：
    六月二十四日夜，沿汤阴城北的汤河东行，经隆化乡，隔河相望的南北隆化是土匪韩长胜、王怀名的称霸区，各自规划附近几个村庄作为领土，不准两区人民互助往来，但在他们抢掠物资的时候，却强迫自己治下的人民各带武器随军助战，进入异地掳掠，战败的用暗杀来“报仇雪耻”！土匪们除了对外扩张的仇杀外还进行对内统治的屠杀。挂在他们嘴上两句话：“把你装进麻布袋甩到卫河里！”或者是“敲掉你！”
    象这样划地而治的“小国家”在汤阴全县大的有四个，在四个之下又有好几十，这就是蒋介石所谓统一军令政令下的中国的一角。刘伯承将军大军三月西进时途经这里，人民当时流着眼泪挽留：“你可不要走了！”刘将军答复了人民的要求，在五一最后解放汤阴，分治的王国和残杀的局面已经结束了。
    一天午后，东入内黄，踏上黄河故道，这里人称沙区。沿途皆枣林、梨园，间有迎春柳圈成一畦一畦的沙田，细雨初晴，人们正在插红薯，种豆子，大军过境，群众满面欢笑，伫立目送，入夜，浩月当空，颇具秋夜清冷之感。所过村镇道路两侧的廊檐下，群众都袒腹赤膊，恬然静睡。
    黎明前，过卫河住高低村，管理员分配我们五人住一个院，进大门洞时见一老太太睡在这里，里面正屋只余半截，睡一壮年女人，另一厨屋，只容一土炕，老太太把大门洞让给两个通讯员，她和媳妇挤在一块儿。我们三个记者只好睡在当院不能伸脚的一块空地上，又热又挤，勉强挨到天明。
    后来我问这个老太太为什么一百五十户人家的村子没住处呢？她说：“俺村本来房子就不多，年头遭殃军三十二师过这儿，带来还乡团，一遭就烧掉两百多间，老百姓都住不下，俺队伍来就更没法儿啦！你知道吗？俺村和中央队是反牌，恁着两边卫河给龟孙打了一年多，他就不敢占俺这里，俺孩孩在枪班，今年二十七岁了，明儿他还要去西北乡捉还乡团哩！”
    当我住在四区碾头集时，作过这样一个极有意义的调查：这是五年来的游击根据地，今年麦头才分罢土地，短短几个月中，她已经作出了这样一些值得骄傲的事情：五年前蒋敌伪当政时全村只有二百卅四户，八百一十四口，土改中逃荒的回来了，激增至二百五十八户，九百七十七口。其中贫农一百七十八户，六百二十三口已收回一千六百二十一亩二分地，全村总人口和标准地总数平均每口分得三亩七分，这里庄稼都是麦秋各半，今年群众收到家的麦子每口合老秤三百二十斤，还把斗争果实买成牲口，全村已由四十多头增至六十余头。领导翻身的农会主席满有信心地向我说：“消灭历年来的白地不成问题。”过去大地主兼土匪头子的曹臣相住在这里时，明要暗抢，群众就这样穷了，光了，迫使二十至三十五岁的青壮年行劫，偷盗的达六十多人；可是曹臣相还要“惩办盗匪”，活活锄死两个农民，翻身农民袁同文在会上很悲愤地说：“老汪、老蒋弄得我爹养不活孩，娘养不活女，肚里饿得没办法，只好逼得去偷，去劫路，最后还要用铡刀铡死我们，旧社会真是吃人呀！”农民除这以外，就是出卖闺女、媳妇的肉体，已坦白痛悔的就有六个，当农民吴兰梦分得土地，收了麦子，喜得回家甩了泥菩萨，他说：“信你，信够了几辈子没饭吃，没地种，我现在信毛主席才几天就有地种也有饭吃了！”他们现在摆脱了死亡、逃荒、劫路、偷盗、娼妓的苦难和耻辱，已开始建设自己的新社会，夏来成很快活地说：“共产党不光叫人有吃有穿，还领导人学好！”
    一个下午到了东距清丰十余里的韩村集，这里曾是冀鲁豫某分区抗日游击中心区，是个千户人家的大镇，队伍刚进村，一个壮年人手执大喇叭筒爬上镇中心高达三丈的木台向四方送话：“部队到了，烧好水的送到广播台下来、水缸也抬到这里。”不到一分钟，担水的，抬缸的陆续来了，群众也怪亲切地问：“同志们累了吧？歇歇，喝喝水！”有的为要争取喝他的开水象一个广告宣传员似地解释：“同志！喝我的甜草水，喝了不得病！”有的说：“我的放了酸柘，解渴好！”有的说：“我的放了枣儿……”村里的老太太，小媳妇，年青活泼的姑娘们也出来拉住女同志们问长道短，谁能说这不是一幅家人欢聚的图画呢？！
    一个夜晚至清丰东三十五里的××，分配我们住一所院里，房东老太太见面就气冲冲地说：“没有地方！有住处俺老婆儿还躺在地上？你看厨屋里中就中，不中就上别家去！”说了很多好话，才勉强让出两间房给我们住。第二天，通讯员杨来福给她挑水，扎条帚磨剪子，又和她拉家常。老太太高兴了，她说：“年头中央捉我小鸡又拿走簸萝，我把中央恨透了，夜里见你们就火儿啦！怪俺老婆眼花没看准是俺自己队伍”！住了两天出发的时候，老太太叮咛说：“你下次过路可得进门儿！你记住俺，俺叫戴老婆！”
    七月四日十点半，正当美制蒋机无目的地轰炸扫射的间隙，我们横渡黄河了，一叶快船穿破滚滚黄浪，两岸清风细玩晴空皓月。登岸南行五里即过里堤，再南行二十里即过南大堤，两道河堤上都掘有向北射击的工事，新旧大小不一，还有交错的道沟，防泛的河堤已破碎不堪了，所过据点围寨有些尚未修成，但就构筑的工程看来已足使人咋舌，我曾问过十多个向导，他们说：“给中央队修围子就没闲过，苦得不用提了！俺队伍要再迟一些过河，那保险高粱也再种不上，这地址儿一年八个月全吃高粱，种不上不全完啦！”
    沿途我看到不少的地方把挺穗的高粱拔掉了，有的已经干可着火，有的还带有余青。据向导说，这是还乡团挨家叫拔的，因为“它荫住国军的眼了。”
    群众一面拔一面含着眼泪回头望望黄河北岸，还乡团这批魔鬼们捉着枪逼在后面说：“看什么？！拔呀！”老乡们也愤怒地回答：“看八路军啥时候过来？！”
    解放军过河来了，救活了高粱，也救活了苦难中的人们！
