　　[This Newspaper Reported] The great locust extermination battle in the Second and Third Districts of Ci County has now come to a victorious conclusion. After the locust nymphs emerged from the soil around the tenth of last month, their spread was quite severe. In the Second District, there were ten villages, including Nanbeikaihe, Sanlitun, Shayingzi, and Changjiazhuang. In the Third District, there were seventeen villages, including Fuyang, Liujiazhuang, Weijiazhuang, and Nanbeibaidao. The affected area stretched approximately forty li from north to south and ten li from east to west, making the situation very serious. After the district government discovered this, it immediately organized the masses to capture and beat the locusts. The Second and Third Districts respectively established locust extermination headquarters. Zhao Rongchang, Chai Shengji, and Long Linshi comrades participated in the command of the Second District. Wu Yong'an, Zhao Rongxian, Hao Meiliang, and other comrades participated in the command of the Third District. County Head Wu and County Secretary Chai personally provided guidance, dividing the locust-affected area into three war zones. Each war zone, according to the severity of the locust situation and the size of the villages, was further divided into three detachments, and the detachments were further divided into brigades, companies, platoons, and other organizations. Each detachment had a reconnaissance squad of ten people and three to four communication personnel. The detachment leader was a district cadre. Each brigade had a leader and a deputy leader, and one political instructor, all responsible village cadres. In addition, there were three to five scouts. The company had a company commander and a political instructor to unify the mobilization of forces and actively carry out zonal extermination (mostly on a village basis). Due to the active leadership of the government, the locust-fighting movement was very lively from the beginning. Cadres and the masses put forward conditions for meritorious competition, resolutely eliminating the locust nymphs. From the tenth to the twenty-second of last month, thirty-eight thousand eight hundred people from forty-nine villages in the two districts participated, completely eliminating the locust nymphs, so that only forty or so mu of ten thousand mu of seedlings were damaged. Twenty-nine male and female locust-fighting heroes emerged. Du Ming, the political director of Xihouzhao, led the entire village to challenge Sanlitun. The village originally stipulated that one hundred and fifty people would participate, but under his active mobilization, organization, and exemplary actions, the number increased to one thousand two hundred people. They traveled eight li to Sanlitun every day before dawn to fight locusts and brought Xihouzhao along with them. Yang Degong's wife from Beikaihe said: "Locusts are like little Chiang Kai-sheks. We can't have a good time unless we kill the locusts." Liu Kuijin from Sanlitun said: "To fight locusts, our thinking must be clear, just like fighting stubborn troops at the front, resolutely eliminate them, without any leniency." He got up very early every day and prepared his tools very well. However, because a large number of nymphs were not killed in Beichaitun, Gutuoyan, and other villages in the Third District of Linzhang, they constantly invaded, and each village is still closely monitoring the situation and fighting them as they come.

　　磁县二、三区蝗蝻全部消灭
    【本报讯】磁县二区三区剿蝗大战，现已胜利结束。该区自上月十日蝗蝻出土后，蔓延甚为厉害，二区有南北开河、三里屯、沙营子、常家庄等十个村。三区为滏阳、刘家庄、魏家庄、南北白道等十七个村，面积南北长约四十里，东西约十里宽，情势甚为严重。区政府发现后，即刻组织群众捕打。二、三区分别设立剿蝗指挥部，二区由赵荣昌、柴生吉、龙林石同志参加指挥。三区由武永安、赵荣先、郝美亮等同志参加指挥。武县长、柴县书亲临指导，把蝗区划分了三个战区，各战区按蝗情轻重、村庄大小，分设三个支队，支队下又设大队、中队、分队等组织。支队设侦察班十人，通讯员三人至四人。支队长由区干部担任，每大队设队长队副各一人，教导员一人，由村负责干部担任，另设侦察员三个至五个。中队设中队长指导员各一人，统一调动力量，积极分区清剿（多以村为单位）。由于政府积极领导，打蝗运动中，一开始即很热闹，干部与群众纷纷提出立功竞赛条件，坚决把蝗蝻消灭干净。两区四十九个村，自上月十号起，至二十二号，即有三万八千八百余人参加，已将蝗蝻全部消灭，使万亩田苗仅有四十余亩受到损失。并涌现出男女打蝗英雄二十九名。西侯召政治主任杜明，领导全村向三里屯挑战，他村原规定一百五十人参加，但在他积极动员组织与模范行动的影响下，增加到一千二百人，每天赶天明即走八里路到三里屯打蝗，并把西侯召带起来。北开河杨德功媳妇说：“蝗虫是小老蒋，不打死蝗虫不能过好时光。”三里屯刘奎金说：“打蝗虫思想要打通，好比前方打顽固军，坚决消灭它，一个不留情。”他每天起得很早，侬具整得很得劲。但因临漳三区北柴屯、谷驼岩等村大批蝻子未打，不时侵入，各村仍在严密注视，随来随打。
