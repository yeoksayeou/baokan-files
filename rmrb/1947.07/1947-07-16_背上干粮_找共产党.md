Carrying Dry Rations
    To Find the Communist Party
    Dou Kai

Zhang Guilin, a peasant who turned over in Qin County, was driven away from Nangu Village by the landlord Zhang Baoxu when he was nine years old. His family's only three houses and twelve mu of land were seized, leaving him with no place to shelter except for a grave where his ancestors were buried. After Zhang Guilin fled to another village, although he would always burn incense and paper money on his ancestors' graves every Qingming Festival, he never vented his anger. This time, he returned to Nangu Village after forty years and reclaimed his three houses and twelve mu of land. He deeply understood that it was the Communist Party that saved him, so he made up his mind to find the Communist Party and thank them for their kindness. However, after calculating for a few days, he couldn't figure out where to find the Communist Party: "You have to find the temple gate to burn incense!" One night, he discussed it with his wife. His wife said, "Do you even know where they live? Where are you going to find them?" She also said, "If we can really find them, it's worth it even if it takes a few days. It's a long way, so burn some dry rations and take some rice and flour with you." When Old Man Zhang Guilin heard this, he felt that his wife's words were very agreeable to him, so he said, "If we go there blindly, I'm afraid we won't find them. Let's ask Wanfu, a comrade from our district farmers' association." The next day, he went to find Wanfu before dawn. Everyone was very excited to see his enthusiasm. A farmers' association comrade told Old Man Guilin, "If you sincerely want to go, we will definitely take you. The road is not too far, it will take about six or seven days. You will not only be able to see the Communist Party, but also Chairman Mao." Old Man Guilin was even happier and couldn't close his mouth. He quickly prepared the dry rations, rice, flour, and yellow steamed buns to take with him, and brought a string of cash, asking Comrade Wanfu to lead him there. As soon as they arrived at the district farmers' association, everyone saw that he was very well prepared. They deeply felt Old Man Guilin's sincerity and his love for the Communist Party. How could they not live up to his good intentions? At that time, they explained to him, "There are Communist Party members wherever the masses have turned over. The roots of the Communist Party are in the bodies of the common people. If you love the Communist Party and keep the Communist Party in your heart, you don't need to go far." Old Man Guilin said, "We know this, but seeing the Communist Party still depends on you. If the Communist Party doesn't dislike us old folks, I also want to join the Communist Party." The comrades of the district farmers' association said again, "You go back first, the Communist Party will come to find you." Only then did the old man happily return.

    背上干粮
    找共产党
    窦凯
    沁县翻身农民张贵林，九岁上就被地主张宝绪赶的离开南沟村，家里仅有三间房子、十二亩地，都被霸占了去，除埋他祖先的一座坟地外，弄的上无片瓦遮身下无立足之地。张贵林逃到外村后，虽然每年清明总要到祖先的坟上插柱香烧几张冥票，但总没给自己出了这口冤气。这次他回到离开四十年的南沟村收回了自己的三间房子、十二亩地，就深知是共产党救活了他，于是下定主意一心想去找共产党，谢谢共产党的恩情。可是盘算了几天，却弄不清楚那里才能找到共产党：“烧香也得找着庙门呀！”一天晚上，就和老婆商量。老婆说：“你可知道人家在那里住呀？去那找呢？”又说：“要是真能找着，就是误上几天工夫也值得，路远烧些干粮，带些米面去一回。”张贵林老汉一听，感到老婆说的很合自己的心思，就说：“糊涂去了恐怕寻不着，还是找咱区农会万福同志问一下。”第二天天还不明就去找万福，大家见他这样热情，都很兴奋，一个农会同志便告贵林老汉说：“你真心愿去的话，我们一定领你去，路也不大远，大概六、七天就到了不但能见共产党，还能见了毛主席。”贵林老汉更高兴的合不上嘴，回到家很快就准备好出发带的干粮、米面、黄蒸馍馍，带了一衩连，让万福同志领他去。一到区农会，大家见他准备的非常妥贴，深感贵林老汉真诚和对共产党如此热爱，怎样才能不辜负他的这番苦心呢？当时就给他解释说：“群众翻身的地方都有共产党，共产党的根就扎在老百姓的身上，你爱共产党，把共产党挂在心上，就不用远走。”贵林老汉说：“这我们知道，不过见共产党还得靠你们，如果人家共产党不嫌咱老，我也要参加共产党。”区农会同志们又说：“你先回去，共产党会去找你的。”老汉才兴高采烈的回去了。
