Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 28th. The Jin-Sui troops are currently engaged in a sharp struggle to purge the landlord ideology and its remnants within their ranks. A section chief of the military region headquarters severely rebuked his landlord family for exploiting his name to evade wartime service. The directly subordinate units of the Third Sub-district held a discussion meeting to expose the shameful behavior of several cadres from landlord backgrounds who were shielding landlords. For example, a section chief of the sub-district headquarters even came forward to threaten the masses and forcibly retained good land while exploiting them with high rents when the masses were settling accounts with his family. A staff officer who married a landlord's daughter even concealed land and property for his father-in-law. This kind of self-criticism greatly surprised the comrades present and aroused vigilance in their thinking. The director of a sanatorium of a certain unit believed that the landlords were being fought against "pitifully" and intentionally obstructed the mass movement, and has been punished. The people of the Jin-Sui Border Region, with the warm heart of cherishing their soldiers, also gave strict education to individual cadres in the troops whose stance wavered. Wang Youye, a probationary staff officer of a certain unit, shielded his landlord mother from transferring property and was accused by the masses. The land reform work team handed him over to the masses for handling. The masses pointed at Wang and said: "Your landlord class is our enemy. Your participation in our troops is a surrender to us. We welcome your true surrender, but we will not accept a fake surrender." Wang finally confessed his mistakes.

　　晋绥部队肃清地主阶级思想
    【新华社晋绥二十八日电】晋绥部队刻正掀起尖锐的斗争，以肃清内部的地主思想及其残余。军区司令部某科长严厉斥责其地主家庭，利用他的名义逃避战争勤务。三分区直属队召开座谈会，揭发几个地主出身的干部包庇地主的可耻行为。如分区司令部某科长，当群众清算其家庭时，竟出面威胁群众，强留好地，并以重租剥削群众。某参谋娶地主之女，竟为其岳父隐瞒土地财产。此种检讨使到会同志都大吃一惊，在思想上引起警觉。某部休养所所长认为地主被斗得“可怜”，有意阻挠群众运动，已受到处分。晋绥边区人民，以爱护子弟兵的热诚心肠，对部队个别立场动摇的干部也施以严格教育，某部见习参谋王有业，袒护其地主母亲转移财产，被群众控告，土地改革工作团即将他交给群众处理，群众指着王说：“你们地主阶级是我们的敌人，你参加咱们部队，就是投降了咱们，咱们欢迎你真投降，假投降是不答应的”。王最后坦白承认错误。
