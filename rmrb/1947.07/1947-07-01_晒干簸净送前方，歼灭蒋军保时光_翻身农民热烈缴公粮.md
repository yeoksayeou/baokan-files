　　Thresh and Winnow Clean, Send to the Front Lines, Annihilate Chiang's Troops and Safeguard the Times
  　Turned-Over Peasants Enthusiastically Hand in Public Grain
    [This newspaper's combined dispatches] The summer harvest is complete. The turned-over peasants in various regions are all offering public grain with unparalleled enthusiasm to support the front lines. They are universally raising the slogan of handing in victory grain for the counteroffensive and defeating Old Chiang to safeguard the times. The masses recognize that handing in grain this year is not paying a "burden" but doing it for themselves. In many places, people are voluntarily handing in more than the assigned task. The masses in the Fourth District of Xiuwu contrasted the exploitation and extortion when Chiang's puppet troops were present with the happy times after the Eighth Route Army arrived, and they all competed to offer grain. Turned-over peasant Wang Shouli said: "If I am not asked to hand it in, I will feel uneasy. If I hand in the grain and defeat Chiang Kai-shek, I will feel happy even if I don't eat a single grain of it." The entire district completed the task two days ahead of schedule, exceeding the original quota by more than 20,000 jin. The masses all said: "This year's public grain is the best ever, with not even a bit of earth in it." In Linxian County, offering grain and earning merit has become a mass upsurge. The eight districts completed the entire task in an average of just two days. In Linqi Town, more than 800 households completed it in one day. Wuzhi completed more than 1,700 shi of public grain in two days. The peripheral areas quickly gathered it even in a guerrilla environment, with men, women, old, and young all vying to sign up to transport it. An old man in his fifties pushed the grain, racing with the young people. Nanwang Village and Beiwang Village competed to hand in grain that was completely clean. The masses in Handan City all used winnowing fans to clean and dry the grain before handing it in. Many villages carried out summer planting and fighting to divide the fruits of victory simultaneously, completing and exceeding the task. The enthusiasm of the peasants in various villages in Wu'an to hand in grain was unprecedentedly high. The masses in the Fifth District voluntarily proposed three guarantees for handing in grain: guarantee no sand, no soil, and no dampness. Shidong Village completed handing it all in three hours. Every household competed to hand in good grain, winnowing it and then threshing it, picking it over and over again. Various villages also universally handed in more. Six villages, including Kuangshan, handed in more than 20,000 jin of wheat. In order to take care of the people's livelihood, the government decided to return the extra grain to the original households, calling on everyone to produce and save to prepare for famine and support the war in the long term.

    [This newspaper's dispatch from Southern Hebei, 28th] With the summer harvest complete, the masses in Qinghe and Qiuxian are actively preparing to offer and hand in public grain to support the front lines. In Wang Shuangmiao, Qinghe, each mutual aid team has launched a competition to earn merit by handing in wheat. Wang Rutian said: "I am challenging Wenxiang's group to see who hands in the cleanest and fastest wheat." Currently, the masses in the entire village are sunning the wheat during breaks from hoeing the fields and planting sweet potatoes, preparing to hand in public grain. Everyone wants to strive to be a model. In Qiuxian's Fourth District, a village cadre meeting was convened to deploy the wheat collection. During group discussions, Tan Yushan of the Central United District said: "This year is a counteroffensive!" Some said: "In order to defeat Chiang the Baldy and live a peaceful life forever, the common people are willing to give a little more." Xing Zhenhua, a farmer representative and a model for handing in grain for many years, said: "The front is fighting for us, and it is only right for us in the rear to send grain. I would rather save on food and clothing and hand in more public grain." Before the meeting was over, Zhang Shengzhuang sneaked back, and four cadres did not sleep all night, completing the task of more than 3,000 jin by the afternoon of the next day.
