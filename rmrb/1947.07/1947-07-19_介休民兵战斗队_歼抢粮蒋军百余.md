(Delayed dispatch) Zhang Ximan, a combat hero of the Jiexiu militia, led a combat team and annihilated over a hundred Chiang Kai-shek troops and "Homecoming Corps" plundering grain in one hour. On the morning of the 26th of last month, a platoon of the enemy's 44th Division, together with over 160 people from the "Homecoming Corps," "Struggle Corps," and "Self-Defense Force," came to Sendai Village to plunder grain. Upon hearing the news, Zhang Ximan immediately cooperated with the Tiebei Combat Team, the Qinyuan Militia Expedition Team, and the Sendai Village Militia to compress and surround them. They launched a sudden attack into the village from the east, west, and north, launching a street fight. The masses in the village shouted and cheered, and the sound of killing was like thunder. Dang Zengrui, the captain of the "Homecoming Corps," led more than 30 people to stubbornly resist inside the courtyard of landlord Wang Jiuqi, but failed to be killed immediately, and the rest surrendered one after another. In this battle, a total of 38 enemies were killed or wounded, and 71 were captured alive, including Lei Guangming, the head of the Struggle Corps. One small cannon, three machine guns, 57 long and short guns, and some bullets were seized. The militia suffered only five casualties. During the battle, the villagers bravely rescued the wounded, volunteered to participate in the war, and seized five long and short guns, recovered five livestock, and six large carts of grain.
