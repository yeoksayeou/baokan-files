At noon on the 6th, the street was shouting, "See the stubborn KMT!" People were crowded together. It turned out that ten captured Kuomintang soldiers from the artillery battalion of the 177th Brigade of the 38th Division were being carried down from Bo'ai City and were about to pass by here.

What was most surprising was that they were all naked, some not even wearing underpants, with only a tattered shirt stained with blood covering them.

"Could it be that the KMT army has a rule of fighting without clothes?"... I asked with curiosity.

A lieutenant secretary said, "...When I was awakened, the troops had already dispersed, and the battalion commanders were nowhere to be found."

Through his explanation, I learned that the person lying on a stretcher with a bare head was Deputy Battalion Commander Peng of the artillery battalion. It turned out that he was also only wearing a short-sleeved shirt.

A new recruit who was recently captured said: "I was wearing a white cloth shirt from home, but the officers said that it would reflect light during battle, so I changed into a tattered cotton jacket. Later, I fell into the water and couldn't carry it anymore, and I lost my shoes too."

    狼狈
    曹展方
    六号中午，街上乱喊着：“看顽固去”！人都挤在一起。原来是从博爱城抬下来十个三八师一七七旅炮兵营的俘虏彩号，要路过这里。
    最使人惊奇的是他们都没有穿衣服，有的连裤衩也没有，只有一个染满了血迹的破烂衬衣盖着。
    “莫不是蒋军有不穿衣服打仗的规矩”？……我带着好奇的心理问。
    一个中尉书记说：“……当我被惊醒时，队伍已经散了，营长们也不知到那里去了。”
    经他说明。我才知躺在房跟一付担架上，光着脑袋的便是炮兵营彭副营长。原来他也只穿着短袖衬衣。
    最近被抓的一个新兵说：“我穿着家里的白布衫，官长说，打仗时怕反光，就换了件破棉袄，后来我掉在水里，就再带不动了，鞋子也丢了。”
