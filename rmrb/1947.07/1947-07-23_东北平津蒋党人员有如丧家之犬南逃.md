Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th. According to various sources: The Kuomintang personnel in Northeast China, Beiping, Tianjin, and other places are extremely panicked due to the victory of the People's Liberation Army's summer offensive. Family members of Kuomintang military and government officials in Shenyang and other places have been fleeing to the south by sea. Those departing from Yingkou Wharf to Shanghai accounted for 80% of the passengers. As soon as the ships arrived, even those without tickets swarmed aboard; ships that could only hold 500 people were crammed with over 1,000. The wharf was bustling like ants moving house all day long. The wealthy and powerful families of the Kuomintang in Beiping, all believing that the area was no longer their safe haven, disregarded the danger of plane crashes and flocked to Shanghai and Hong Kong. Tianjin already appeared to be in a state of war. The defensive fortifications built over a year ago but never used were guarded by fully armed soldiers, and traffic was cut off early at 10:00 PM. In Jinan, after suffering repeated defeats, Wang Yaowu wailed in the Dà Huá Daily, requesting the Kuomintang to increase troops and to move the Kuomintang’s reactionary command center in Xuzhou to Jinan. He also lost confidence in Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "key offensive," claiming: "It is difficult to win by attacking, and it is impossible to defend firmly."

　　东北平津蒋党人员有如丧家之犬南逃
    【新华社陕北十九日电】综合各方消息：东北、平、津等地蒋党人员，因解放军夏季攻势胜利而恐慌万分。沈阳等处蒋家军政官员家属，纷纷渡海南逃。由营口码头去沪，占乘客百分之八十，轮船一到，无票者也蜂拥上船；仅容五百人之船，硬挤上千人以上，码头上终日如蚂蚁搬家。北平蒋党豪门巨族，咸认该地已非彼等之安乐窝，均不顾飞机失事危险，纷纷作沪港行。天津则已俨然如入战争状态，四郊构筑年余未用之防御工事，已由全副武装士兵把守，晚间提前于十时断绝交通。济南方面，王耀武在连战连败之后，在大华日报发出哀嚎，要求蒋党增兵，并要求将徐州蒋陈反动指挥中枢搬往济南，彼并对蒋介石之所谓“重点进攻”丧失信心，自称：“进剿则难获胜，坚守则防不胜防。”
