　　Red Dragon Stirring Up the Yellow River
    Yong Jin
    On the plains of Ji, Lu, and Yu, between Fan County and Yuncheng, lies the ancient Yellow River. Yunbei is the hometown where the heroes of Liangshan fought in ancient times. The people here not only inherited the heroic fighting tradition of Liangshan, but are also good at fighting the Yellow River water. The heroes live on both sides of the Yellow River. No matter how treacherous the storms are, they always jump into the water naked and float freely on the water. Sometimes they roll over and dive into the water, swim far away, and then emerge again. Therefore, the people call them "water coots" and "red dragons." Shi Yanchao and Shi Hongxin are two of these tens of thousands of water coots.
    Shi Yanchao and Shi Hongxin are both Communist Party members. Shi Yanchao is also a militia captain and has served as the director of the district joint association. Shi Hongxin is an old militiaman. His father was an old sailor who tied a large gourd to his back when he was a child and told him to cross the Yellow River. At the age of fifteen, he could cross the Yellow River naked. He could stay under water for fifteen minutes before coming out. He could even hold a Type 38 rifle and shoot at the enemy in the rolling Yellow River. This May, Chiang's army frantically "swept" the Yunbei area. The enemy used a three-sided encirclement to push the people of Yunbei, from south to north, to the bank of the Yellow River, preparing to wipe them out in one fell swoop. In the dead of night, Shi Yanchao, armed with a Mauser pistol, and Shi Hongxin, armed with a Type 38 rifle, crossed the Yellow River in a small boat. At this time, more than 300 people who had been driven to the river bank were at a loss. The two of them rowed over. Shi Yanchao directed the people to cross the river, while asking Shi Hongxin to find another cadre. As dawn approached, he knew that more people would be driven to the river bank by the enemy, so he rowed his boat back, waiting for people in distress. As soon as the boat docked, dozens of enemies rushed up. He jumped into the roaring Yellow River.
    Shi Hongxin, who was looking for the cadre through the Yellow River waves, ran around in the enemy's nest all night, but couldn't find him. When he returned to the bank of the Yellow River and was about to take off his clothes and swim, he happened to meet Comrade Wu XX, a district cadre. He was about to throw himself into the river because he had nowhere to go under the enemy's artillery fire, when Shi Hongxin arrived. He tied a rope around his waist and said to Comrade Wu XX, "I am a Communist Party member. If we are to die, we will die together. I will pull you across the river." Comrade Wu, seeing the more than three-mile-wide water surface and such large waves, was afraid that he would not be able to cross and would implicate others, and refused several times. But the enemy quickly rushed up, and the two of them jumped into the Yellow River at the same time. Shi Hongxin, holding the Type 38 rifle, pulled Comrade Wu XX while fighting back against the enemy on the shore. Finally, they both crossed the Yellow River. When they reached the shore, Comrade Wu XX's body was frozen stiff and only woke up after being warmed for a long time. The next day, Shi Hongxin swam across the Yellow River again to find out the situation in Henan, and secretly swam back that night.
    On the night of the 19th, Comrade Shi Hongxin sent several cadres to Henan. When he came back, it was dawn and the enemy had also arrived. The enemy strafed him with machine guns. He couldn't wait to steer the boat. He grabbed the Type 38 rifle and dived into the water. After a while, he emerged again, fired a few shots at the enemy, and when the enemy opened fire, he dived into the water again. He fought the enemy, appearing and disappearing unpredictably in the rolling waves.
    Shi Hongxin is also skilled at capturing enemies alive. Once, the enemy was building a village in Li Yuzhuang. He and Ye Guangyou carried big guns and rowed a small boat over, and soon captured six "Homecoming Corps" members. The enemies on the south bank of the Yellow River talk about the stories of these two red dragons like myths. Now, on both sides of the Yellow River in the liberated area of Yunbei Fannan, which has been occupied, there are about 700 "red dragons" like Shi Yanchao and Shi Hongxin. They all appear and disappear in the waves of the Yellow River, fighting the enemy.

　　红色蛟龙闹黄河
    勇进
    在冀鲁豫的平原上，在范县与郓城之间横隔着一道古黄河。郓北本是古代梁山英雄战斗的家乡，这里的老百姓不特继承了梁山的英勇战斗传统，而且善于与黄水作战。好汉们生活在黄河两岸，不管风波如何险恶，总是光着身子一下跳入水中，尽情的在水上飘浮，有时一翻身钻到水里去，泅过远远的地方再钻出来，因此老百姓叫他们为“水老鸪子”“红色蛟龙”。石衍朝、石红信就是这些成千成万的水老鸪子中的一个。
    石衍朝和石红信都是共产党员，石衍朝还是个民兵队长，作过区联合会主任。石红信是个老民兵，他爹是个老水手，从小就在他的背上捆上一个大葫芦，叫他过黄河。十五岁时，他就可以光着身子横渡黄河了；他可以钻进水里十五分钟才出来；他并且可以在黄河滚滚中拿着三八式步枪向敌人射击。今年的五月，蒋军疯狂的“扫荡”郓北地区。敌人用三面包围的办法，由南向北把郓北的人民都压在黄河边；准备一举消灭。在深夜里，石衍朝拿着一把盒子枪，石红信拿着一把三八式，驾着一只小船，渡过了黄河。这时被赶到河边上的三百多老百姓，正在无路可走的时候，他俩划着船过去了。石衍朝一面指挥着老百姓过河，一面叫石红信去找另一个干部。天快亮了的时候，他知道还会有人被敌人赶到河边来的，他又驾着船渡过来，等待灾难中的人。船刚靠岸，几十个敌人冲上来了，他纵身跳下了咆哮着的黄河。
    翻着黄浪河去找干部的石红信，在敌人窝里跑了一夜，也没有找到。他回到黄河岸上正要脱衣泅水的时候，恰巧碰到一个区干武××同志。他在敌人的炮火下，无路可走，正要投河时，石红信到了。他将一条绳子拴在自己的腰里，对武××同志说：“我是个共产党员，咱们要死就死在一起，我拉你过河”。武同志看到三里多宽的水面，浪头那么大，他怕自己过不去，又连累了人家几次拒绝了。但敌人很快就冲了上来，他们两个同时跳入了黄河，石红信拿着那枝三八式，一边拉着武××同志，一边向岸上敌人还击。终于两个人都渡过了黄河，到岸上时，武××的身子冻僵了，烤了半天才醒过来。第二天石红信为了探听河南的情况，又泅过了黄河，当天夜里又偷偷的泅回来。
    十九日夜，石红信同志送几个干部到河南去，回来时天亮了，敌人也来了。敌人用机枪向他扫射，他等不及驶船，拿着那枝三八式一下子钻到水里去，一会儿又钻出来，向敌人打几枪，等敌人开枪扫射时，他又钻到水里去。他在滚滚的波浪中，神出鬼没的和敌人战斗着。
    石红信也是个善于活捉敌人的能手，有一次敌人在李玉庄修寨子，他和叶广有扛着大抢划着小船过去了，一会儿就捉到了六个“还乡团”员。黄河南岸的敌人，象神话一样的谈论着这两个红色蛟龙的故事。现在在郓北范南这块被沦陷了的解放区的黄河两岸，象石衍朝、石红信这样的“红色蛟龙”，大约有七百多名，他们都出没在黄河的波涛中与敌人战斗着。
