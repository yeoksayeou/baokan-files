Xinhua News Agency, Ji Lu Yu, 27th: Reporter Yong Jin reports: At the beginning of the month, the reporter went upstream along the turbulent Yellow River, traveling more than five hundred li on foot, to inspect the dike repair and defense situation in Ji Lu Yu. When I arrived in Hexi (a newly established county west of Changqing River), more than 15,000 farmers in the county were working day and night to repair the dikes; vehicles transporting stones along the way were in constant flow. The local people are also launching a stone donation campaign; all the stones for the dozens of stone dams that have been built in the past were donated by the people. The reporter followed Director Li of the dike repair section to inspect the river embankment. Chiang's army (parts of the 73rd Army, 13th Army, and 93rd Army) frequently bombarded with artillery fire on the east bank of the river, forcing us to lie down and hide every few steps. When we reached the embankment, we saw that two farmers carrying soil, Zhuang Qingjin and Zhuang He, were seriously injured by the bombing and fell into unconsciousness. In the air-raid shelter, Director Li told the reporter that since the dike repair began, Hexi County alone had suffered 175 casualties of workers and more than 40 head of cattle. In the afternoon, before the sun had set, three American-made B-17 Flying Fortress bombers came over the sky and bombed wildly before heading west along the embankment. At night, the workers were busy transporting stones and pounding them with rammers. Although machine gun and artillery fire were incessant, the dike repair work was carried out more intensively. On the 4th, the reporter traveled southwest along the river to the @Shan dangerous section. The river bend there was very turbulent. Director Wang of the dike repair headquarters told the reporter that the dike repair method here in the past was guerrilla repair, because the area was once occupied by Cao Fulin's troops of the 55th Division of Chiang's army, and the masses could only "avoid when the enemy comes, and repair when the enemy leaves." Many of our workers were captured by the enemy, and engineer Qi Wanjun was captured by the enemy and thrown into the Yellow River to drown. When I told everyone that Cao Fulin's troops had been surrounded in Yuncheng by General Liu Bocheng's troops, they were all overjoyed. An old lady said, "If we get rid of those good-for-nothings, we can repair the dikes with peace of mind." From @Shan, we traveled overnight to Sunkou dangerous section in Shou Zhang. It was already 11 p.m., but Chiang's planes were still bombing and strafing, dropping more than 30 flares. On the night of the 7th, the reporter crossed the river along the south bank of the Yellow River to the east of Wanglaojun Village. The road ahead was blocked by a large ditch dug by the former 74th Division of Chiang's army, which was one zhang five chi wide and nine chi deep. The embankment also had a trench 300 meters long and 3 meters deep. The enemy's bunkers and barricades were all made of materials used for repairing the dangerous sections of the dike. When the reporter and others were resting in Yangji Village, villager Yang Yu'er told Director Meng of the dike defense office that the water rose a lot in early June, and he had asked Chiang's army to allow them to repair the dikes to save themselves, but not only was he refused, but he was also severely beaten. Continuing forward to Hongsuda Dam in Juancheng, this is a famous dangerous section. In the 14th and 24th years of the Republic of China, the dike was breached twice here, and more than 300,000 people in Su Lu were flooded. Now, Chiang's army has destroyed the dike of the dam and turned it into a bunker, and dug out two places at the junction to build concealed bunkers. On the bunker at the Jiangsizhuang dangerous section, there was even a horizontal plaque with the words "Tong Qing Lou" written on it. The dike is destroyed, and the lives and property of millions of people are about to be flooded. Does Chiang's army call this "celebration"? When the reporter arrived at the Changyuan embankment, he saw that about one-fifth of the people rushing to repair the embankment were soldiers in uniform from General Liu Bocheng's troops. While protecting the masses, they personally participated in the repair. Instructor Sun of the Third Company was pushing a small dirt cart with soldier Wang Jinkui of the Sixth Squad of the company, competing with the masses. The scars of Chiang's army's destruction of the river embankment are gradually being smoothed over by the hands of the military and civilians in the liberated areas.

　　蒋方恣意破坏修堤
  　五百里河岸敌炮声机声不绝我各地军民刻正奋力抢修中
    【新华社冀鲁豫二十七日电】记者勇进报导：月初，记者沿着浊浪排空的黄河逆流而上，步行五百余里，巡视冀鲁豫修防情形。到河西（长清河西新设县）时，该县一万五千余农民正在昼夜抢修；沿途运输石料的车辆络绎不绝。当地人民并正掀起献石运动；过去已修成的几十个石坝，所有的石料都是人民献出的。记者随该修防段李主任至河堤视察，河东岸蒋军（七三军、十三军及九三军各一部）频频以炮火轰击，行数步必卧下隐藏。至堤上时，还见担土农民庄庆金和庄合两人被炸重伤，昏厥不醒。在防空洞中，李主任告记者：修堤以来，仅河西县就伤亡了一百七十五个工人和四十多头牛。下午太阳还未落，三架美制空中堡垒又临上空，狂炸一阵之后，沿堤西去。入夜，工人忙着运石打硪，虽机枪炮声不绝，但修堤工作更紧张进行。四日，记者沿河西南行，至＠山险工处，该河曲水势甚猛，修堤指挥部王主任告记者：过去这里的修堤方法是游击修法，因该处曾被蒋军五十五师曹福林部所盘踞，群众只能“敌来我避，敌走我修。”我方工人不少被敌抓去，工程师戚万均被敌俘去后摔入黄河淹死。当我把曹福林部已被刘伯承将军部队围在郓城的消息告诉大家时，无不欢欣雀跃。一个老太太说：“除掉那些孬种，咱们就能安心修堤了。”从＠山夜行至寿张孙口险工，时已夜十一时，但蒋机还在轰炸扫射投掷照明弹卅多枚。七日夜，记者过河沿河南岸至王老君村东，去路已被前蒋军七十四师挖的丈五宽九尺深的大沟所阻。大堤边上还挖有三百多公尺长、三公尺深的鸿沟。该敌所修碉堡、鹿砦材料，全系修险工之工料。记者等在杨集村休息时，村民杨玉尔告修防处孟处长，六月初水涨很大，他曾去要求蒋军允许修堤自救，不但未允，反被痛打。复前行，至鄄城红苏坝，此为有名的大险工，民国十四年和二十四年曾于此两次决堤，苏鲁卅余万人民被淹。而今，蒋军竟将该坝堤工挖毁修成碉堡，并将合龙处两处挖空修成暗堡。在江泗庄险工处碉堡上，竟书有“同庆楼”之横额。大堤挖毁了，千百万人的生命财产即将被淹，难道蒋军以此称“庆”吗？记者至长垣堤岸时，见抢修群众间夹杂着约五分之一的刘伯承将军所部戎装战士，他们一面掩护群众，一面亲自参加抢修，三连孙指导员正与该连六班战士王金魁推着小土车与群众比赛。蒋军破坏河堤的创痕，正逐渐为解放区军民自己的手所平复。
