　　Under the Yama's Nose Mountain
  　One of the Records of the 阻击 (Zǔjī) Battle in the Yilu Mountainous Region

    On the second day of the 阻击 (Zǔjī) battle in the Yilu Mountainous Region, the 200th Division of the Chiang army's Fifth Army, invading from the east of Laiwu, timidly crawled to the foot of Yama's Nose Mountain (forty miles east of Laiwu) under the successive 阻击 (Zǔjī) of the People's Liberation Army, with men and horses mixed together, gathering in the mountain gully, looking around.

    A platoon of the People's Liberation Army had been waiting on the mountain for a long time, seeing everything clearly.

    Squad leader Yang Qingdang asked He Wanfu, "What do you think the enemy looks like?" He made a face and replied, "Like a bear!" "Heh heh! Like a bear." Both squads burst into laughter.

    The Chiang army retreated backward and bombarded the mountain with mountain guns for fifteen minutes, but the top of the mountain remained silent. Two Chiang planes circled a few times and then listlessly flew away.

    Cheng Jingyi, the squad leader of the third squad, tugged at Hao Fengchu's sleeve and pointed to the foot of the mountain, saying, "Look, those clumsy fellows are starting to climb up." Machine gun squad leader Xu Mengji interjected, "There are probably a battalion of soldiers, we must pay attention!" Machine gun deputy squad leader Wei Changhua glanced through the sight and turned to ask his squad, "What shall we give the enemy?" They replied in unison, "Give the enemy a bloody nose!" Wei Changhua laughed, "This nose is not simple, one touch and he'll see 'Yama'."

    The Chiang army climbed halfway up the mountain, hesitated for a while, and suddenly became "brave," straightening their backs and rushing towards the top of the mountain.

    "哒哒哒………” The machine gun on the mountain roared. The Chiang army's formation was thrown into chaos, and they turned to run. Cheng Jingyi and Yang Qingtang's two squads charged forward like tigers descending the mountain, and four or five hundred Chiang soldiers, like bursting mountain torrents, rushed down the mountain, with those in the rear falling in response. He Wanfu, while chasing, pointed to the corpses left by the enemy and shouted, "The enemy is playing new tactics again. This is called the human bullet tactic."

    Several warriors hiding under the big rocks also concentrated their fire on the Chiang army. Half an hour later, there wasn't a shadow of the Chiang army left on the mountain. When the remaining Chiang army climbed to the nearby Tianjingyu, suddenly grenades and machine guns rang out from every corner of the mountain, the Chiang army lost their souls and rolled down one after another. At this time, a squad of warriors leaped out from Xiaolingshan, and Xiao Hui, the leader of the machine gun mutual aid group, shouted loudly at the fleeing enemy, "Where are you escaping to, we have been waiting for you for a long time." The Chiang army bumped east and west, and were beaten by the People's Liberation Army warriors until they had nowhere to hide, and one by one they met "Yama" under Yama's Nose Mountain. Yama's Nose Mountain is still firmly held in the hands of the People's Liberation Army. (Xu Xiong)

　　阎王鼻子山下
  　记沂鲁山区阻击战之一
    沂鲁山区阻击战的第二天，自莱芜东犯的蒋军第五军二百师，在解放军节节阻击下，胆小如鼠地爬到了阎王鼻子山（在莱芜东四十里）脚下，人马杂沓，麇集在山沟里，东张西望。
    解放军一个排在山上守候多时了，一切看得清清楚楚。
    班长杨庆党问何万福：“你看敌人象个什么？”何做了一个鬼脸回答：“象个狗熊！”“嘿嘿！象个狗熊。”两个班都笑开了。
    蒋军向后一退，用山炮向山上击了十五分钟，山头上寂静无声。两架蒋机打了几个转，也无精打彩地溜走了。
    三班班长程景义拉一拉郝奉初的衣襟，指着山下说：“看那些笨家伙开始向上爬了。”机枪班长徐孟吉在旁插嘴：“大概有一个营的兵力，得注意！”机枪副班长韦昌华对着瞄准器了瞟瞟，转身问同班：“给敌人的什么？”齐声回答：“给敌人碰一鼻子！”韦昌华笑道：“这个鼻子可不简单，一碰就要叫他见‘阎王’”。
    蒋军爬到半山腰，犹豫了一会，忽然“勇敢”起来，直起腰杆冲向山顶。
    “哒哒哒………”山上的机枪叫开了。蒋军队形大乱，回头就跑。程景义、杨庆堂两个班以猛虎下山之势一齐杀上前去，四五百蒋军象迸发山水一泻而下，跑在后面的应声而倒。何万福一面追去，一面指着敌人遗下的尸体叫道：“敌人又玩新战术了。这叫做肉弹战术。”
    隐蔽在大石下的几个勇士，也集中火力向蒋军猛烈发射。半个钟头后，山上蒋军连个影子也没有了。当剩下的蒋军爬到了附近的天井峪时，忽然手榴弹、机枪又从山的每个角落里响起，蒋军丧魂落魄，纷纷下滚。这时小岭山又跃出一班勇士，机枪互助组长萧辉向逃命的敌人大喝一声：“往那里逃，咱们等候你多时了。”蒋军东碰西撞，被解放军勇士打得无地可钻，一个个在阎王鼻子山下见到了“阎王”。阎王鼻子山仍然坚守在解放军手里。（徐熊）
