Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: An Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai, 16th: The parents of more than 30 students who were arrested by the Chiang government during demonstrations in late May and early June and have not yet been released, stated that they are determined to continue striving for the prompt and unconditional release of their children from prison. The Chiang Kai-shek Garrison Headquarters insists that students sign so-called repentance letters and requires parents to fill out guarantees, guaranteeing that students "withdraw from their original schools, leave Shanghai immediately, and turn over a new leaf" before they will be released. However, the parents have sternly rejected the above unreasonable demands.

    沪被捕学生仍被囚家长要求从速释放
    【新华社陕北十七日电】美联社上海十六日电：五月底与六月初在游行示威中，被蒋政府逮捕迄未被释放之三十余学生家长表示：决心继续争取从速无条件释放其子弟出狱。蒋记警备司令部坚持要学生签具所谓悔过书，并要求学生家长填具保证书，保证学生“从原校退学、立即离开上海、改过自新”后始予释放，但学生家长对上述无理要求已严词拒绝。
