Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 29th. A unit of the local armed forces of Huaihai in Northern Jiangsu advanced to the east bank of the Grand Canal and captured the Jiang-puppet strongholds of Luguo and Yanghua near Suqian. On the night of the 21st, the unit launched a night attack on Luguo, twenty miles southeast of Suqian, completely annihilating a platoon of Jiang-puppet troops under the traitor Sun Liangcheng defending the area. Upon hearing the news, the Jiang-puppet troops in Yanghua, more than twenty miles southeast of the area, fled in panic to Henan, and the town was restored. At this point, a large area on the east bank of the Grand Canal has been liberated again, facing the liberated areas behind Jiang in northern Huai across the river.

　　宿迁近郊克两据点
    【新华社华中二十九日电】苏北淮海地方武装一部挺进运河东岸，攻克宿迁近郊之陆果、仰化两蒋伪据点。二十一日夜，该部夜袭宿迁东南二十里之陆果，全歼守敌蒋伪军孙逆良诚一排。该地东南二十余里之仰化蒋伪军，闻讯即仓惶逃窜河南，该镇遂再告恢复。至此，运河东岸大块地区已重获解放，与淮北蒋后解放区隔河相望。
