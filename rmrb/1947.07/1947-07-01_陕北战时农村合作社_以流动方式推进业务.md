Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 28th—To meet wartime needs and persist in business, cooperatives that solve the problem of daily necessities in rural areas have emerged successively in Ansai and Yan'an counties in the Yanshu sub-district of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. The Xihoukou People's Production Cooperative in the Second District of Ansai has persisted in business since the war, selling 400 zhang of homespun cloth and 4,000 jin of salt. Its business is mainly mobile, supplemented by stores. The business scope not only covers all villages in the Second District but also extends to Yanhewan in the First District, Zhaoan in the Third District, and Zhenwudong in the Fourth District. In early May, the price of salt rose to 20,000 yuan per jin, but the cooperative still sold it at 13,000 yuan per jin, stabilizing the market price. The cooperative also absorbed Border Region currency by selling large quantities of goods, consolidating the value of the Border Region currency. Now, the cooperative has a capital of 130 million yuan and profits of over 70 million yuan. The cooperative in Hezhuang, Yan'an County, also regularly sends four cadres carrying daily necessities such as cloth, matches, and needles and thread to the edge of enemy-occupied areas, where they are welcomed everywhere. The cooperative also compiles statistics on the amount of salt needed by the masses and arranges for livestock to transport and supply it. Cooperatives in Wudui, Panlong, and other districts of Yan'an County have also promoted business in this way.

　　陕北战时农村合作社
  　以流动方式推进业务
    【新华社西北二十八日电】适应战时需要，坚持营业，解决农村日用品困难的合作社，已在陕甘宁边区延属分区安塞、延安县相继出现。安塞二区西河口民营生产合作社，战争以来，坚持营业，已销售土布四百丈，盐四千斤。其业务以流动为主，门市为辅。业务范围不但遍及二区各村，且深入至一区延河湾、三区招安及四区真武洞一带。五月初，食盐涨至二万元一斤，该社仍按一万三千元一斤出售，稳定了市价。该社并以大量抛售货物，吸收边币，巩固了边币价值。现在该社已拥有一万万三千万元资本，盈利七千万以上。延安县何庄的合作社，亦以四个干部经常背着布匹洋火针线等日用品，出入于敌军侵占之边沿地带，到处受到欢迎。该社并统计群众所需之食盐数目，由合作社专派牲口驮往供给。延安县乌队、蟠龙等区合作社，亦已照此办法推进业务。
