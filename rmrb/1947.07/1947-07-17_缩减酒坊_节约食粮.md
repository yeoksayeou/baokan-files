    Reduce Breweries
    Conserve Food Grain
    [Our Dispatch] The Taihang Second Administrative Office's Public Brewery Management Office, responding to the call for conserving and preparing for famine, convened a meeting of managers of public breweries from various counties in Zuoquan West Pass on June 12th to study the issues of reducing institutions and stockpiling grain for famine relief. After detailed discussion, decisions were made to abolish those that should be abolished, merge those that needed to be merged, and reduce brewing where appropriate. Of the original 36 breweries in the eleven counties of the entire Second District, it was decided to retain only 29, and to reduce their scale and production. The amount of wine produced in January of this year was 153,115 jin, but now the monthly production is only 102,453 jin. If the drought continues to develop, the remaining breweries will also be considered for closure. The Zuoquan Seventh District Cooperative held a cooperative affairs meeting on June 22nd, breaking with the purely profit-seeking merchant viewpoint and clarifying the policy of serving the masses. It was decided to compress institutions and lower the standard of living. The original flour mills, due to high grain prices, low finished product prices, and difficulty in selling, while also wasting grain, were decided to be shut down. In terms of lowering the standard of living, it was decided to eat less white flour and more porridge, and to save vegetables, for a total savings of more than 18,900 yuan per day. The Taiyue District Wine Monopoly Second Manager's Office has also begun to tighten institutions and conserve for famine relief, reducing contributions to support the front lines. The office had 13 hotels, 2 factories, and 5 workshops, totaling 21 units including the general manager's office. Twenty-seven cadres were streamlined, and salaries, food, and other expenses can be reduced by 2,903,120 yuan per year. All cadres have also changed from a salary system to a supply system, and together with various savings, a total of 5,470,200 yuan in expenses can be reduced each year. Workers and cadres have launched a donation campaign to support the front lines, and together with various distribution points, they have already donated 66,160 yuan.

    缩减酒坊
    节约食粮
    【本报讯】太行第二专署公营酒业管理处响应节约备荒号召，六月十二日假左权西关召开各县公营酒坊经理会议，研究缩减机构积粮备荒问题。经过详细讨论，该撤销的撤销，需要并的合并，宜减烧的减烧。整个二分区十一县原有酒坊三十六座，现在决定只留二十九座，并缩小规模，减少产量。本年一月份产酒数量为十五万三千一百一十五斤，现在每月仅产十万二千四百五十三斤，若旱灾继续发展，所留酒坊也将斟酌撤销。左权七区联社于六月二十二日召开社务会议，打破单纯营利的商人观点，明确为群众服务方针，决定压缩机构，降低生活水平，原有粉坊因粮价高涨，成品价低，出售不易，同时又浪费粮食，决定停止。降低生活水平方面，决定少吃白面，多吃稀饭、节省蔬菜，共计每日可节约洋一万八千九百余元。太岳区酒业专营第二经理处，也已开始紧缩机构、节约备荒，减献金支援前线。该处酒店十三个、工厂两个、作坊五个，连总经理处总共二十一个单位，精简了二十七个干部，薪金伙食等全年可减少开支二百九十万三千一百二十元。全体干部并由薪金制改为供给制，连同各项节约，每年共可减少开支五百四十七万零二百元。工人干部为了支援前线掀起献金运动，连同各分销处，已献洋六万六千一百六十元。
