Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 12th – The six million soldiers and civilians in the Northern Jiangsu Liberated Area have persisted in the struggle behind enemy lines against Chiang, and in the past six months, they have crushed dozens of “encirclements” and “sweeps” by Chiang's troops. To this day, they still maintain a vast rural area south of the Longhai Railway, north of Majia Lake, east to the Yellow Sea, and west to the Grand Canal, encompassing nineteen counties. In the Yan (city) Fu (Ning) area south of the Yan River, over 90% of the population and land are under the administration of the democratic government, and it controls over 300 miles of coastline between the Sheyang River and the Xin Huai River estuary, as well as coastal salt fields and cotton fields. Of the 138 towns and cities in the entire area, only 25 are occupied by Chiang's troops; the remaining 113, including commercial centers such as Yilin and Dongkan, are in the hands of the people. The Huaihai area north of the Yan River has also developed from small pockets of resistance to the recovery of large areas. Of the five major transportation lines, Chiang's troops only control the Huai (yin) Shu (yang) line.

Since mid-January, when our Central China Field Army took the initiative to move north of the Longhai Railway to continue annihilating the enemy in large numbers, the soldiers and civilians of Northern Jiangsu have been fighting Chiang's troops independently. Organizations at all levels have selected and dispatched a large number of cadres to go deep into districts and villages to lead the masses in guerrilla warfare. Agencies at all levels have been streamlined as much as possible, and the Party, government, army, and people are united as one to fight a life-and-death struggle against Chiang's troops and the Chiang regime. At that time, Chiang's troops were preparing for a large-scale offensive against southern Shandong and had gathered a large army to invade and occupy most of the villages in Huaiyin, Shuyang, Lianshui, Tongyang (Xin County), and other places. Under these serious circumstances, the militia and guerrillas still persisted in their original locations, moving at night and hiding during the day, to obstruct Chiang's troops. Seven militiamen in a village in Si (yang) Shu (yang) County annihilated more than thirteen enemy soldiers by sniping. Chiang's troops then concentrated their forces to repeatedly "encircle and suppress" the Huaihai area, launching a seesaw war. The Wuji stronghold on the Shu (yang) Yi (Dashan) road was lost and regained four times, and the villages south of Liupi Town in Huaiyin were lost and regained more than ten times. The situation was particularly serious on the south side of the Longhai Railway, where Chiang's troops "swept" more than 20 times. The local armed forces and militia adopted the tactic of "the enemy advances, we advance," causing the enemy to repeatedly fail. Not only did they suffer losses, but the area they occupied also continued to shrink. The liberated area of Huaiyin expanded from one township and six square miles to twenty-one townships and over one thousand square miles. More than 14,500 square miles of land have been recovered in the entire area. The Yanfu area, on the other hand, has always maintained large areas of resistance, and towns such as Hede and Huduo have never been occupied. The militia and guerrillas are often active within ten miles of Chiang-occupied cities. Currently, there are no Chiang's troops stationed within sixty miles north and south outside Funing City. In Lianshui East County, the enemy only occupies the isolated city of Lianshui, and the vast area between Yanfu and Huaihai has been linked into one piece.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the masses of all strata in Northern Jiangsu have risen up to participate in the patriotic self-defense war. Old farmer Chen, from the suburbs of Huai'an, sacrificed her son and destroyed her house to save ten guerrillas. Da Songshan, a landlord from Yan (city) East County, voluntarily went to the front line to participate in the war and captured four Chiang's soldiers in one operation. Wang Datao, a ten-year-old child, bravely relayed orders to the guerrillas in the rain of bullets. One million people from five counties, including Huai'an, participated in the transformation of the terrain, destroying over 700 miles of roads, building 920 dams, and digging 2,500 miles of transportation trenches in two months, carrying out tunnel warfare.

Under armed protection, various construction projects are still proceeding as usual. Land re-investigation began in mid-March, and the demands of the poor and landless peasants have been met in some areas. In the marginal areas, the struggle against the reversal of land distribution and rent reduction is being carried out in conjunction with armed forces. This spring, 200 miles of canals were opened, and 80,000 acres of wasteland were reclaimed. With the help of government loans, folk textiles, coastal salt farms, and cotton fields are also vigorously producing.

Northern Jiangsu is tying down the Chiang army's 44th Division, 28th Division, one brigade of the Reorganized 4th Division, one brigade of the remnants of the 51st Division, one brigade of the 69th Division, six regiments of the puppet Sun Liangcheng's forces, two divisions of the remnants of the traitor Hao Pengju's forces, three detachments of the traitor Xu Jitai's business patrol corps, and the Jiaozong, salt police, security team, etc., totaling about 80,000 people. This accounts for about one-eighth of the total strength of Chiang's troops in East China. Over 18,000 of them have been annihilated, providing strong support to the East China battlefield and greatly inspiring the democratic movement in the Chiang-controlled areas. Currently, the soldiers and civilians of Northern Jiangsu are redoubling their efforts to build and expand the liberated area, welcoming the all-out great counter-offensive.

    苏北恢复大块地区
    半年敌敌一万八千
    现在加倍努力迎接大反攻
    新华社华中十二日电苏北解放区六百万军民坚持蒋后斗争，半年来粉碎蒋军数十次“清剿”、“扫荡”，迄今仍保持陇海路以南、马家荡以北、东滨黄海、西抵运河十九个县的广大农村。盐河以南的盐（城）阜（宁）区百分之九十以上的人口与土地，均在民主政府治下，并控制包括射阳河、新淮河口间三百余里海岸线及海滨盐场与棉田。全区一三八个市镇中，为蒋军占踞者仅二十五个，其余一一三个，包括益林、东坎等商业中心在内，均在人民手中。盐河以北淮海区亦由小块坚持发展到大块恢复、五条主要交通线，蒋军仅控制淮（阴）沭（阳）一条。
    自一月中旬我军华中野战军主动转移至陇海路北继续大量歼敌，苏北军民即单独抗击蒋军。各级组织曾遴派大批干部，深入区村，领导群众游击战争。各级机关尽量精简，党政军民团结一致，与蒋军蒋政权作殊死战。是时，蒋军作大举进攻鲁南准备、曾集结大军，侵占淮阴、沭阳、涟水、潼阳（新县）等大部村庄；在此严重情况下、民兵游击队仍坚持原地，昼伏夜动，阻扰蒋军，泗（阳）沭（阳）县某村七个民兵利用打冷枪即歼敌十三余人。蒋军旋又集中兵力，对淮海区作反复“清剿”，展开了拉锯式的战争。沭（阳）伊（大山）路上吴集据点四失四得，淮阴刘皮镇以南村庄失而复得在十次以上。陇海路南侧尤为严重，蒋军曾“扫荡”二十余次，地武民兵采取敌进我进战术，使敌屡次扑空，不但损失折将，侵占区亦不断缩小，淮阴解放地区由一个乡、六方里，扩展至二十一个乡、一千余方里。全区土地已光复者达一万四千五百余方里。盐阜地区则始终大块坚持，合德、湖垛等市镇，从未被占。民兵、游击队常活跃蒋占城郊十里左右，现阜宁城以外南北六十里内无一蒋军据点。涟（水）东县全境敌仅占涟水一座孤城，盐阜、淮海间广大地区已联成一片。
    苏北各阶层群众，在共产党领导下，均奋起参加爱国自卫战争。准安城郊老农妇陈奶奶舍子毁屋，救出十个游击队员。盐（城）东县地主大松山自动上前线参战，一次活捉蒋军四名。十龄儿童王大桃在弹雨中奋勇替游击队传达命令。淮安等五个县百万群众参加改造地形，二个月破路七百余里，打坝九百二十条，并挖掘交通沟二千五百里，进行地道斗争。
    在武装保卫下、各项建设仍照常进行。三月中旬开始土地复查，部分地区已满足贫雇农要求。边缘区则与武装结合，开展反倒田、倒租斗争。今春曾开河渠二百里，消灭荒地八万亩。民间纺织、海滨盐坊、棉田等，亦在政府贷款帮助下，大力生产。
    苏北牵制蒋军四四师、二十八师、整四师一个旅、五十一师残部一个旅、六十九师一个旅、伪孙逆良诚部六个团、郝逆鹏举残部二个师、徐逆继泰部商巡总队三个支队及交总、盐警、保安队等共约八万人。占华东蒋军总兵力约八分之一，已被歼灭者达一万八千余人；给予华东战场以有力支援，予蒋管区民主运动以莫大鼓舞。现苏北军民正加倍努力建设扩大解放区，迎接全面大反攻。
