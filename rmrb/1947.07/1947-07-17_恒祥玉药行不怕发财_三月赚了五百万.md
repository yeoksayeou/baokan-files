    Hengxiangyu Medicine Store Isn't Afraid of Getting Rich
    Earned Five Million in Three Months
    [This Newspaper Reports] Shang Xiuzhen, the second manager of the Hengxiangyu Medicine Store on East Avenue in Xing City, believed the deceptive propaganda of the enemy puppets before liberation. During the anti-traitor, rent reduction, and liquidation movement, he thought that all wealthy private businesses would be struggled against until they were ruined. Therefore, he dared not continue operating. He ate well, drank well, and lived extravagantly every day, saying, "Anyway, private businesses cannot exist. It will be too late to regret it after they are all ruined." He spent his days planning to disperse his capital and goods. Last October, a turn-over struggle movement was launched in East Street. The masses arrested and struggled against the traitor-bullies Wu Xingrong and Liu Xiangting, and he also participated in the struggle meeting. During the masses' recounting of their suffering, he figured it out. He realized that Wu Xingrong's past evil deeds of colluding with the enemy puppets to oppress the medicine store should be struggled against. He also recounted his suffering, saying, "He won't yield when people struggle against this kind of person." He understood that the government's policies and decrees were to struggle against feudal landlords and traitor-bully forces, not to struggle against wealthy businesses. The government was implementing a policy of developing industry and commerce, and it was definitely not deceiving people. This year, he actively started working as soon as the store opened in the first month of the lunar new year, and earned five million yuan in just three months, with a total current value of nine million yuan. If he had worked hard last year and not wasted a year, he could have earned over two million yuan. He regrets that he earned less money last year, which was all the result of his own suspicion of the government's policies. (Xingtai Forward News)

    恒祥玉药行不怕发财
    三月赚了五百万
    【本报讯】邢市东大街恒祥玉药行二经理尚修珍，在解放前听信了敌伪的欺骗宣传，在反奸减租清算运动中，他认为是有钱的私人商号都要斗光，因此他就不敢继续往下干了，每日吃好喝好铺张浪费，他说：“反正私人商号不能存在，等斗光了后悔也迟了”，他整日谋划分散资本和货物。去年十月东街展开了翻身斗争运动，群众把奸霸武星荣、刘香庭等人扣起斗争，他也参加了斗争会。在群众诉苦中，他想通了，武星荣过去勾结敌伪欺压药行的恶迹应该斗，他也诉起苦来，他说：“这种人斗争他不屈”。他了解了政府的政策法令是斗争的封建地主，奸霸势力，而不是斗争有钱的商号，政府是执行发展工商业政策的，决不是哄人。今年正月开张即积极干起来，仅三个月时间就赚了五百万元，合计现值共有九百万元。如果去年好好干不要耽误一年时间的话，可赚二行余万元，他后悔去年少赚了钱，都是自己怀疑政府政策的恶果。（邢台前进报）
