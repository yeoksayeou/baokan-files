　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: TASS, London, 29th—The National Committee Congress of the British Amalgamated Engineering Union, the second largest union in Britain with over 900,000 members, has passed a resolution demanding a review of British diplomatic personnel and the purging of elements with significant ties to the Conservative Party, to be replaced with personnel more in line with the will of the people. Another resolution from the committee condemned Britain's increased trade relations with fascist Spain, opposing the shipment of urgently needed British electrical machinery to Spain. The resolution demands that steps be taken to blacklist all contracts signed with Spain, and instructs union members not to undertake such work. Upon the motion of the union's chairman, Jack Tanner, the committee also passed a resolution demanding that all United Nations members sever diplomatic and trade relations with Spain.
