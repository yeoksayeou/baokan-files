    Ping Shun Cheng Guan Commends Production Models
    Seventy-Year-Old Makes Meritorious Service in Textile Production
    [This newspaper Ping Shun news] In order to effectively promote drought prevention, famine preparation, production, and frugality, Cheng Guan convened a mass meeting on June 28th to report, evaluate, and record merits. First, each mutual aid group held discussions to deliberate who had contributed; then, each team reported and recorded merits; then, the evaluation committee evaluated the merits, announced them to the masses, and, after a final review by the masses, announced the names of the meritorious individuals. The meeting announced ten model groups and seventy individuals who had made contributions, as well as three model textile technicians. The best model group, Li Fu Lin’s group, had clear thinking members who carried water and provided firewood for the families of soldiers and helped the families of soldiers weed twenty mu of land first. Liu Huai Bao’s whole family made contributions; Huai Bao led the mutual aid group and made great contributions; his wife, although she had four children, besides often taking care of others’ spinning, spun more than seventy jin of cotton in one hundred days; his mother, an old lady in her seventies, taught four experienced apprentices, each of whom could weave half a jin of cloth every day. Luo Bi Zhen also taught four apprentices and has been weaving cloth for more than sixty years. When the elected people spoke, Fan Er Niu, a model technician, stood up and said: “Although I am old, I still have the determination to teach more apprentices in the future and pay more attention to the textile group.” At this time, the masses applauded thunderously and asked us to learn from the spirit of old man Fan Er Niu who is old in years but not in spirit. The political director summarized the weeding and pointed out that we should not be arrogant or conceited because we have made contributions, but should take advantage of our merits to add to them; those who have not made contributions should strive to make contributions next time and not be discouraged. The director of the cooperative summarized the achievements of the past one hundred days of spinning and weaving, totaling 3,400 jin of cotton spun (460 jin of cotton spun in the last one hundred days), and 2,765 jin of cloth woven. Finally, the work of saving, preparing for famine, preparing for late planting, and releasing feet was determined, stipulating that each person should save three he of grain per day, eat jade corn mixed with chaff, and eat rice mixed with vegetables, and it was decided to collect thirty jin of wild vegetables and fifteen jin of chaff every five days, and those who can complete the above tasks will each be given a small meritorious service.

    平顺城关评选生产模范
    七十岁人纺织立功
    【本报平顺讯】城关为有力推动防旱备荒生产节约，特于六月二十八号召开了报功评功记功的群众大会。首先各互助组进行酝酿讨论谁有功劳，继经各队报功记功，再经评委员评功，即向群众宣布，经群众复评作最后决定，再向群众宣布立功人名。大会宣布立功的计有模范组十个，另有七十个立了功，还有模范纺织技师三个。最好的模范李付林组，全组组员思想明确，给抗属担水供给烧柴并先给抗属锄苗二十亩。刘怀保是全家立功，怀保是领导互助组立了大功，他的老婆虽有四个小孩，除经常照顾别人纺织外，自已百日纺花七十余斤，他娘七十多岁的老太太，她教会了四个成手学徒，每日均能织布斤半。骆必珍也教会徒弟四个，织布六十余年。当选人讲话时，范二纽模范技师站起来说：“我虽老了，还有决心，今后多教会几个徒弟，对纺织组多操些心”。这时群众掌声如雷，并同我们要学习范二纽老人家这种人老心不老的精神。政治主任总结了锄苗，并指明我们立了功也不骄傲，不自大，应急取功上加功，没立功的争取下次立功，不要灰心，。合作社社长总结前后百日纺织成绩，计共纺花三千四百斤（后百日纺织四百六十斤），前后共织布二千七百六十五斤。最后确定节约备荒准备晚种、放足等工作，规定每人每日节约粮食三合，吃玉茭掺糠，吃米掺菜，并决定五天打野菜三十斤，集糠十五斤，能完成上述各项者各记小功一次。  （永  芳）
