　　I. What kind of person is Cui Tiansheng?

　　Cui Tiansheng is about fifty years old, from Zhongli Village, Third District, and a newly liberated household. He used to be dirt poor, and was forced by life to work as a laborer in the Northeast during famine years. He only returned after the victory of the counter-offensive. He was very active in the land reform movement and was elected as the civil affairs director by the masses. This time he volunteered to join the war, and was elected as the squad leader in the stretcher team. Because of his diligent work and active assistance to the masses in the new district in their production and liberation, he was elected as a top model at the final summary meeting of the county stretcher team.

　　II. Figuring out people's thoughts and proactively finding work

　　When Cui Tiansheng's stretcher team first settled in Fanzhuang, Tangyin, the relationship with the masses was not very good, and they couldn't even borrow handy tools, which was very awkward. The landlord of the house where Cui Tiansheng lived was an old woman named Chang, a tenant farmer, who was also somewhat displeased with the stretcher team living in her house.

　　Just at this time, the leadership proposed the "Love the People" movement, and Cui Tiansheng was the first to help the villagers with their work, but he was rebuffed, as people wouldn't let him do it. What to do? Cui Tiansheng thought that the old woman wouldn't let him do it because she didn't understand them and didn't know what they were planning to do by helping her with work. So he talked to the old woman. Through the conversation, he learned that her latrine was full, and her son was not at home, and she was afraid to let them do such dirty work as digging manure for fertilizer. Cui Tiansheng, having grasped this thought, organized several stretcher team members to quickly dig out more than a dozen loads of manure, swept the yard clean, and filled the water tank to the brim. As a result, the old woman Chang's tearful face immediately turned into a smiling one. She no longer doubted the stretcher team, and went directly to Cui Tiansheng and requested, "There are still a few acres of cotton; hoe them for me!" Tiansheng readily agreed and asked, "How many acres are there?" The old woman originally had eight acres, but only dared to say three or four acres. Cui immediately agreed to hoe them for her tomorrow.

　　The next day, Tiansheng mobilized eight comrades to hoe all eight acres of cotton for her, and returned home. The old woman had already prepared noodles in soup and cigarettes, which she held in both hands and placed in the yard, asking everyone to drink. The team members didn't drink, and the old woman said, "If you don't drink, I won't take the pot back." Afraid that she would get impatient, everyone had to drink.

　　Tiansheng said, "Old woman, what else do you need help with?" She said somewhat awkwardly, "There are three rooms that haven't been built yet. The materials have been prepared for a long time, for my child to marry a wife and live in, but no one is willing to help." Tiansheng said, "We'll do it tomorrow. We have all kinds of talents inside. Building this is a piece of cake!" This made the old woman go back, but she didn't sleep all night. The old woman Chang didn't expect that the stretcher team would be willing to help with such troublesome things, and that they would start construction the next day. She also had twenty bundles buried in the foundation of the house belonging to the landlord Song! She was so anxious that she didn't sleep all night. The next day, she made an excuse not to let the stretcher team start construction, and secretly moved the bundles at night. On the third day, she called Cui Tiansheng to start building the house.

　　III. No sweet dew comes without a gentle breeze

　　Cui Tiansheng, having taken on the task of building the house, went back and convened a meeting of the entire team, mobilizing and organizing twenty people (including three carpenters and three masons). He was responsible for leading the overall work, and Liu Wanhe was in charge of planning, with each person leading four assistants. Everyone discussed the plan and decided to complete the task within three days. When they started working, they worked faster and harder than they would for their own homes. Some made beams, some mixed mud, some peeled sorghum stalks to make fences, and some leveled the base. Like the Eight Immortals crossing the sea, each showed their unique talents. In two and a half days, they turned a dilapidated place into a brand-new house, placed in front of the masses of the whole village. The latticed windows were wide open, and the windows were also plastered with mud, built exceptionally well. The main beam was engraved with the words "Built by the Stretcher Team of the Third District of Cixian County" as a memento.

　　Old woman Chang looked at the new house, her lips trembling with gratitude, not knowing what to say. She could only make some good food to send to them, but they firmly refused to eat. The old woman insisted, forcing them to drink some soup each before she would stop. That night, Cui Tiansheng discussed with the village and took the opportunity to convene a mass meeting. Everyone wanted them to help, and they agreed as much as possible. Seeing how good the stretcher team was, the masses borrowed pots and bowls, and found firewood, solving all the difficulties of the stretcher team one by one.

　　IV. Gratitude should be directed to Chairman Mao

　　With the new house completed, old woman Chang kept saying to Tiansheng and everyone, "I have never seen such good people in my whole life; I really have no way to repay your kindness." Tiansheng said, "The kindness is not from us to you, but from Chairman Mao. If Chairman Mao had not led us to liberate ourselves, we ourselves would not be able to live, let alone help you liberate yourselves!" Old woman Chang was surprised to hear this and asked, "Who is Chairman Mao? I've never heard of him!" Cui Tiansheng said, "Chairman Mao is the savior of us peasants, the Eighth Route Army is the team he leads, he is the leader who leads the poor to liberate themselves." From then on, old woman Chang told everyone about Chairman Mao.

　　V. Moved by the stretcher team, the Chang family brings out the bundles

　　Old woman Chang's son, Chang Haoshu, had been tearing down city walls in the city for a few days. When he came back and saw that the new house for his wedding was built, he was so happy that he jumped three feet high and came to talk to Cui Tiansheng. Cui Tiansheng took the opportunity to tell him about the experiences of the poor farmers in the old district in organizing farmers' associations and fighting against landlords. Chang Haoshu listened with great interest, but he didn't dare to do anything. It turned out that as soon as the landlord Song Zhanmin knew that the Eighth Route Army was coming, he distributed his fields and property to his tenants and some other farmers for safekeeping, and took his guns away. Before leaving, he threatened, "Whoever reveals anything will be shot in the dark!" Therefore, Chang Haoshu was very afraid. Cui Tiansheng, having figured this out, slowly led him to pour out his grievances, arousing his hatred for the landlord.

　　One day, the village chief convened a mass village meeting, asking everyone to think about how to repay the kindness of the stretcher team in hoeing the fields and building the house. The Chang family was also present, thinking hard. They felt that they had been hiding bundles for the landlord, which was really unfair to the stretcher team, but they didn't dare to say it. At this time, Village Chief Fan advised from the side, "The stretcher team is helping us, isn't it to liberate us? Taking out what you're hiding for the landlord is the only way to be worthy of them!" Old woman Chang listened and no longer hesitated, looking at her son and saying, "A thousand people walking, one person leads the way, you say it!" The son stood up and continued, "Whatever everyone says to do, we'll do!" He no longer concealed it and moved out all twenty bundles of Song Zhanmin's that they had been hiding. Everyone opened them up and saw that there were white cloth, black floral cloth, thread shoes, everything, just good clothes alone amounted to one hundred and sixty-one pieces, as well as quilts and silver dollars.

　　With the Chang family taking the lead, it influenced and moved thirty-three other farmer households in the whole village (out of more than fifty households) who had been keeping the landlord Song Zhanmin's things, to report them all one by one. In total, there were more than ten piculs of miscellaneous grains, five rifles, four Mauser rifles, one music box, many grenades, and countless clothes and valuables, which were immediately distributed to the masses. The land reform in Fanzhuang was thus opened up with a bang.

　　掏粪盖房助翻身的崔天生担架队
    曹利正
  　一、崔天生是啥样人
    崔天生今年有五十来岁，三区钟离村人，新翻身户。他过去是个赤贫，灾荒年被生活所迫到东北当了劳工，反攻胜利后才回来。在土地改革运动中表现非常积极，被群众选为民事主任。这次他自愿参战，担架队里选他当分队长。因为工作勤谨，积极帮助新区群众生产翻身，所以在全县担架队最后总结大会上，被大家选为头等模范。
    二、摸心思主动找活干
    崔天生的担架队到汤阴范庄刚住下来时，和群众关系搞的不大好，连手边的用具都借不到，真是蹩扭得很。崔天生住的一家房东叫常老婆，是个佃户，对于家里住的担架队也是有些不顺眼。
    恰在这时领导上提出了民爱民运动，崔天生首先就去帮助老乡做活，结果碰了个钉子，人家不让做。这可怎么办呢？崔天生一想，老婆不让做，一定是不了解咱，不懂咱给他做活是个啥打算。所以他就和老婆谈起来，谈谈谈谈，就知道她家的茅坑满了，儿子不在家又不敢让我们给他做挖茅肥这样脏活。崔天生一摸准这种心事，便组织了几个担架队员，把十几担粪很快挖完，院子扫的一干二净，水缸担的是满满腾腾。这一来常老婆把付哭丧脸从此变得眉开眼笑。她不再疑惑担架队了，便走到崔天生的跟前直截请求说：“还有几亩花，给我锄锄吧！”天生满口应承，就问：“有几亩？”老太太本来有八亩，但只敢说有三、四亩。崔就一口答应明天给她锄。
    第二天天生动员了八个同志给她把八亩花都锄好了，回到家来。老太太把早已滚好的面条汤和纸烟两手掇着，笑盈盈的放在院里叫大家喝。队员们不喝，老婆说：“你们不喝，我就不往回端锅了。”这样大家怕她不耐烦，只好喝了。
    天生说：“老太太你还有啥活干哩？”她好不自然的说：“有三间房没盖，材料早已准备好啦，叫俺孩娶媳妇住哩，就是没人闹。”天生说：“明天我们就干。咱们里面什么人材都有，盖这个还在话下！”这样一来闹的老婆回去了，但是一夜没睡，常老婆想不到这样麻烦的事，担架队都肯给闹，而且第二天就要来动工。她房子地基里还埋有地主宋家的二十个包袱呢！直急得她一夜没睡，第二天她借故没让担架队动工，晚上偷偷把包袱转移了，第三天才喊崔天生动工盖房。
    三、没有清风换不来细雨
    崔天生揽下人家盖房的活，回去就召开全队会议，动员组织了二十个人（内有木匠三人，泥匠三人）。他负责领导全盘，刘万和管计划，每人各带四个助手。大家商定计划，三天以内要完成任务。他们干起活来，比给自己家里干还快还出力。有的做梁，有的调泥，有的剥高粱杆皮子做栅子用，有的打平基地。八仙过海，各显神通，两天半把一个黑谷落变成了一座新崭崭的房子，摆在全村群众面前。隔扇大开，窗上又用泥摸了一下，盖的特别好。大梁上雕刻着“磁县三区担架队代建”的字样，作为留念。
    常老婆看看新房子，感激的嘴唇直动弹，不知该说个啥才好。只好做点好饭送他们，他们坚决不吃，常老婆就闹着，逼着他每人喝了点汤，才算完事。当天晚上崔天生和村里商量，乘机召开了个群众会，大家纷纷要他们帮助，他们都尽量答应了，群众看见担架队这样好，于是借锅碗的借锅碗，找烧柴的找烧柴，把担架队的困难，一一都解决了。
    四、报恩要报毛主席
    新的房子落成，常老婆念念不忘地对天生和大家说：“我活了一辈子再没见过你们这样好的人；我实在没办法来报答你们的恩情。”天生说：“恩情不是我们给你的，是毛主席给你的。不是毛主席领导我们翻了身，我们自己还活不了，那里能来帮助你们翻身！”常老婆听了惊奇地问：“毛主席是个谁，我怎么没听说过！”崔天生说：“毛主席是咱农民的救星，八路军就是他领导的队伍，他是领导穷人翻身的。”从此常老婆逢人便说毛主席。
    五、感动常家拿出包袱
    常老婆的儿子常好戍，几天来在城里扒城墙，回来一看，娶媳妇的新房盖起啦，只喜得一跳三尺高，就来找崔天生拉话。崔天生趁机给他讲些老区穷苦农民组织农会，斗争地主的经验，常好戍听的很起劲，但是却不敢干，原来本村地主宋占民一知道八路军要来，就把他的田地财产，分给他的佃户和别的一些农民代为保存，自己把枪带走，临走时威胁说：“谁露东西，打谁的黑枪！”因此常好戍很害怕。崔天生摸清了这一点，就慢慢地引他倒苦水，激起他对地主的仇恨。
    这一天，村长召集了群众村民大会，要大家想想担架队锄地盖房的恩情如何报答。常家母子也在场，左思右想，自己给地主藏包袱，实在对不起担架队，可是又不敢说，这时范村长又从旁劝说道：“担架队帮咱，还不是为的叫咱翻身，把给地主藏的东西拿出来，才算对得起人家呀！”常老婆听了不再犹豫，就看着他儿子说：“千人行路，一人带头，你说吧！”儿子站起来接着说：“大家说怎干就怎干！”就不再隐瞒把藏的宋占民的二十个包袱都搬出来。大家打开来一看，里面有白布、黑花布、线鞋子，什么都有，单好衣服就是一百六十一件，还有被子和现洋。
    常老婆母子一带头，果然影响和感动了全村农民三十三家（全村五十余户）保存地主宋占民的东西，都一一报出来。共杂粮十余石，步枪五支，拐把四支，八音一支，手榴弹很多，衣服财物，更不在少数，当即分给群众。范庄的土地改革就这样轰开啦。
