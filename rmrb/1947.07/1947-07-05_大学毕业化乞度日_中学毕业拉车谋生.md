　　University Graduates Begging for a Living
  　Middle School Graduates Pulling Rickshaws to Survive
    △ A reporter from the Chengdu Da Hua News Agency, on May 29th, saw a woman, about 30 years old, sitting on the side of Xiaotian West Street outside the South Gate, with a diploma in front of her, which was a graduation certificate from Henan University. The woman had the bearing of a scholar and spoke elegantly. She claimed that it was difficult to find a job and she had to beg for a living, expressing extreme sadness.
    △ Dai, a young man from Leshan County, Sichuan Province, recently graduated from junior high school. His family was too poor to support him, so he pulled a rickshaw in the city to make a living.
    △ Henan Private High School in Lushan County, Henan Province, was recently surrounded by the entire team of officers and soldiers of the Jiang-affiliated Self-Defense Force of the county, using machine guns and grenades, because of a quarrel between the school's students and the soldiers. One student was killed and twelve were injured.
    △ Sun Jianru, a Chinese language teacher at Anhui Provincial Shouxian Middle School, wrote a couplet to describe his plight due to low pay and difficult living conditions: "Deceiving articles, fraudulent career, hawking skills, begging life."
    △ Xiong Daren, a professor in the Biology Department of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou and concurrently a professor in the Biology Department of Guangdong Provincial College of Arts and Sciences, whose students are all over South China, previously taught at Guilin College of Arts and Sciences. Because his income could not support his family, he attempted suicide by taking poison but was rescued. After returning to Guangzhou and continuing to teach, his life became even more difficult due to soaring prices. He often sent his children out to pick wild vegetables to satisfy their hunger. Unfortunately, on May 13th, they accidentally ate poisonous mushrooms, causing the whole family to be poisoned and fall into a coma. Fortunately, it was discovered early, and they recovered by noon the next day.
