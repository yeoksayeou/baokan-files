　　【This newspaper, Taiyue, 4th report】 The "Four Seize" movement to fight drought and overcome disaster in Yangcheng Fourth District has achieved initial success. From June 8th to 18th, within ten days, 10,274.5 mu of millet, corn, and various miscellaneous fields were replanted, 20,923 mu of corn were planted as a returning crop, and 3,681.35 mu of millet were weeded. Due to the in-depth mobilization of cadres, the masses have understood the seriousness of fighting drought and overcoming famine. Therefore, as soon as this slogan reached the villages, the masses quickly organized and took action. For example, after the cadres of Renjing Village returned on the 8th, they convened a village cadre meeting that evening. The next day, they went to various groups to deliberate. The masses had high confidence, guaranteeing to work harder. In particular, the women guaranteed that all full and half laborers would go to the fields together. The entire village completed the "Four Seize" movement in nine days and collected 190 jin of wild vegetables. After the cadres of Dongfeng Village conveyed the "Four Seize" movement, the masses proposed a specific slogan for this movement: "Three Dos, Six Do Not Neglect." The "Three Dos" are: male full and half laborers organize to work, female full and half laborers organize to work, and old men and children organize to work. The "Six Do Not Neglect" are: old men and children do not neglect plowing and threshing, male laborers do not neglect carrying manure and gleaning wheat on their way back, and women do not neglect weeding and cutting wheat. Therefore, labor efficiency has been unprecedentedly improved. In ten days, in addition to completing the tasks in their own village, they also helped neighboring villages with replanting. Fuzhe Village temporarily changed the form of mutual aid organization, concentrating various skilled workers who knew how to cut, plow, and plant into groups, cutting, plowing, and planting as they went, saving more manpower than before. At present, the entire district is redeploying the work of fighting drought and overcoming disaster, continuing to implement the struggle against natural disasters.
　　【This newspaper】 The masses in Changle Village, Gaoping Seventh District, are preparing for drought and famine. After the wheat harvest, they immediately carried out replanting. Village Chief Li Liyan and Public Security Officer Li Tianyuan beat gongs at dawn, calling the masses to go to the fields. Thanks to everyone's joint efforts, after harvesting all 490+ mu of wheat in the village within four days, the entire village immediately actively replanted late autumn crops to supplement the poor summer wheat harvest this year, planning for long-term famine preparedness. The masses in Sizuo, Second District, after being mobilized by village cadres, emphasized the importance of seizing the opportunity to return to the village and replant late autumn crops. On the 24th, all men, women, and children in the village went to the fields together, taking active action to replant. (Gaoping Dazhong Daily)

　　阳城四区十天成绩
  　补种：一万亩　回茬：二万亩
    【本报太岳四日电】阳城四区抗旱渡灾的四抢运动已初步获得成绩。自六月八日至十八日十天内，补种谷子、玉茭及各种杂田一万零二百七十四亩五分，回茬点种玉茭二万零九百二十三亩，锄谷子三千六百八十一亩三分五厘。由于干部深入动员，群众对抗旱渡荒的严重性已经了解，所以此一口号一到达各村，群众便迅速组织起来，迅速动手。如人井村干部八日回去后，当晚便召开了全村干部会议，第二天便分头到各小组进行酝酿，群众信心很高，保证一定加劲干，特别是妇女们保证全半劳力一齐上地，全村九天即完成四抢运动，并采野菜一百九十斤。董封村干部传达了四抢运动后，群众又提出保证此一运动的具体口号“三干、六不误”，三干即男全半劳力组织起来干，妇女全半劳力组织起来干，老汉儿童组织起来干；六不误是老汉儿童犁地打场两不误，男劳力担粪回来捎麦两不误，妇女锄草、割麦两不误。因此劳动效率空前提高，十天内除本村完成任务外，并帮助外村补种。府泽村临时变更了互助组织形式，将会割、会犁、会种的各种能手集中分组，随割、随犁、随点，较前节省力量。目前全区重新布置抗旱渡灾工作，继续贯彻与天灾作斗争。
    【本报讯】高平七区常乐村群众为抗旱备荒，麦收后，马上进行回茬抢种。村长李立言，公安员李天元天一明便打锣喊叫群众往地里走，由于大家共同的努力，四天内割完全村四百九十余亩麦后，全村立即积极回茬抢种晚秋，来补助今年夏麦歉收，作长期备荒的打算。二区寺左群众，经村干部动员后，强调提出抓紧回村，抢种晚秋，于二十四日全村男女老少一齐上地，全体动手，积极回茬。（高平大众报）
