　　Taihang Disaster Situation
    [Our Taihang News] From late June to early July, all districts in Taihang suffered from hail disasters one after another. The affected areas include 13 counties such as Xingtai, Xiangyuan, Wuxiang, Yushe, Heshun, Xiyang, Zuoquan, Changzhi, Pingshun, Huguan, Cixian, Anyang, and Linxian, involving more than 200 villages. In the affected areas, the autumn crops are half-destroyed in the lighter cases, and the harvest is bound to be greatly reduced; in the severe cases, the crops are all destroyed. The damage is particularly severe in Xingtai, Anyang, Pingshun and other places. In some places, the hail is as big as bowls, and some cattle, sheep, and houses in Pingshun have also been lost. At the same time, the drought is still developing: for example, in the six counties of Huolu, Zanhuang, Lincheng, Neiqiu, Xingtai, and Shahe in the First District, 227,936 mu of land have not been sown at all. In the border counties of the Second District, and in five or six counties of the Third and Fifth Districts, no thorough rain has been received so far. All localities are continuing to carry forward the indomitable spirit of drought resistance for the past three months and overcome the pessimistic mood of some of the masses. The areas affected by the hail disaster are also rapidly replanting or completely replanting late crops, and earnestly carrying out the austerity movement to overcome famine.

    【本报太行讯】太行自六月下旬至七月上旬，各分区均先后遭受雹灾，被患地区包括有：邢台、襄垣、武乡、榆社、和顺、昔阳、左权、长治、平顺、壶关、磁县、安阳及林县等十三个县，约有二百以上村庄。凡受害地区，轻者秋禾半毁，收成势将大减；重者庄稼均被打坏。尤以邢台、安阳、平顺等地被害为甚，有些地方，雹如碗大，平顺部分牛、羊、房屋亦遭损失。同时旱情仍在发展：如一分区获鹿、赞皇、临城、内邱、邢台、沙河等六县，尚有二十二万七千九百三十六亩土地全未下种。二分区边沿各县，及三、五分区五、六个县，至今亦未获透雨。各地正继续发扬三个月来抗旱的顽强精神，克服部分群众悲观情绪。受雹灾地区，亦迅速补种或全部改种晚庄稼，认真开展节约渡荒运动。（太行行署建设处）
