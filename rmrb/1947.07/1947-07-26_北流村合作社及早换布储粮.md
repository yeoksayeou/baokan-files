　　【Report from this newspaper, Licheng】May has passed and June is here, but Beiliu Village has not had a thorough rain, and a serious famine is looming. Cooperative hero Li Jiaokui and village cadres are leading large and small cooperatives to find ways for the masses to survive the famine. Zhang Lisheng suggested: "I have long wanted to take cotton to Tunliu to exchange for grain with the masses to survive the famine." After discussion, the following measures were decided: First, take cloth to exchange for grain to survive the disaster, and improve the enthusiasm of women in spinning and weaving. Second, ensure that production, sideline occupations, and transportation are not disconnected, and that labor and animal power are not idle. Cooperative hero Li Jiaokui also put forward the slogan: "Store grain, not cloth." He explained the situation to the masses, reminding them of the situation during the famine in 1943 when people from Ping Shun Hequgou brought bedding, clothes, and utensils to our village to exchange for rice to survive the famine. Everyone felt very sad upon hearing this and recognized the benefits of exchanging grain early. Zhang Pijiang and Zhang Yuku, two small cooperatives, jointly went to Xiangyuan to exchange jujubes with the masses for grain to survive the famine. Currently, the collection of grain by the masses in Beiliu Village has become a movement. (Wen Xiu)
　　【Report from this newspaper, Ping Shun】Yangjingdi has not relaxed its struggle against drought and preparation for famine due to the lack of rain. Moreover, it has carried out a general mobilization of the entire village to further deepen the fight against drought and preparation for famine. The cooperative originally planned to buy 100 shi of corn and 300 shi of bran. It has now completed 28 shi of corn and 140 shi of bran. The militia self-defense force, with a total of 139 people, originally planned to collect two dou of bran and ten jin of wild vegetables per person, striving to complete it within three days. After one and a half days of effort, a total of 18 shi and 3 dou of bran and 906 jin of vegetables have been collected. Ninety-one spinning and weaving women have earned more than 443,000 yuan. At a price of 800 yuan per dou of corn, they can buy 55 shi, 4 dou, and 5 he of corn. Under the long-term plan for drought prevention and famine preparation, the entire village has now collected a total of 84 shi of corn, 176 shi of bran, and more than 6,000 jin of wild vegetables.

　　北流村合作社及早换布储粮
    【本报黎城讯】五月过去六月来，北流村还没下透雨，灾荒严重摆在眼前，合作英雄李甲魁和村干部领导大小合作社给群众来想办法渡荒。张李生提出意见说：“我早想拿上棉花上屯留与群众换粮食渡荒。”经大家讨论订出以下办法：第一、拿上布换回粮食渡灾荒，提高妇女纺织情绪。第二做到生产、副业、运输三不脱节，劳力畜力两不闲。合作英雄李甲魁并提出口号：“存粮不存布。”给群众算帐，让群众回顾在四三年灾荒时，平顺河渠沟，拿上被褥衣服用具来咱村换米渡荒的情形，大家一听非常难过，认识了及早换粮的好处。张丕江与张玉库两个小型合作社，合伙到襄垣拿上枣儿与群众换粮渡灾荒。现北流村群众集粮已形成运动。（文秀）
    【本报平顺讯】羊井底没因落雨丝毫放松抗旱备荒的斗争，而且进行了全村总动员，进一步深入了抗旱备荒。合作社原计划讲买玉茭一百石、糠三百石，现已完成玉茭二十八石，糠一百四十石。民兵自卫队共有一百三十九人原计划每人集糠二斗，采野菜十斤，争取三日内完成，经一天半努力现共积糠十八石三斗，菜九百零六斤。九十一个纺织妇女，赚洋四十四万三千余元，每斗玉茭以八百元计，能买玉茭五十五石四斗零五合。全村在防旱备荒长期打算下，现共集玉茭八十四石，积糠一百七十六石，采野菜六千余斤。（王俊、荣福、郝杰）
