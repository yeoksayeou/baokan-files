    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th—Amidst widespread floods, droughts, and locust plagues in areas controlled by the Chiang government, it has been decided that this year's agricultural tax in kind will be approximately 66 million shi, not including "purchases." According to an Associated Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 9th: the levy is estimated to be three million tons of rice (note: approximately 66 million shi), to be collected starting October 1st. This figure is based on estimates from the "General Mobilization Conference." The dispatch also stated: in addition to military grain procurement and tax in kind, the Chiang government will also impose surcharges on agricultural taxes, grain levies, and the recovery of arrears from previous years. It is generally believed that Chiang Kai-shek's exploitative extortion will infinitely deepen the famine in the Chiang-controlled areas, throwing the people of these areas into the abyss of starvation and death, thereby inevitably inciting people's desperate resistance.
    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 11th—Shanghai News reports: The Chiang government has again increased extra levies on the Nantong homespun cloth industry, a sharp increase of more than ten times compared to last winter. Last winter's "local special tax" was 20 yuan per bolt of small cloth and 70 yuan for 30-yard improved cloth. Currently, under the guise of so-called "local subsidies," 200 yuan is extorted per bolt of small cloth and 500 yuan for large cloth, while 30-yard improved large cloth is taxed as high as 1,000 yuan. Under such exorbitant taxes and levies, the Nantong homespun cloth industry is bound to accelerate its bankruptcy.

    蒋党勒索军粮
    今年预定六千六百万石
    必将更加逼起饥民抗争
    【新华社陕北十一日电】蒋政府于其统治区内遍遭水、旱、蝗灾侵袭之际，决定本年度田赋征实约六千六百万石，而且“征购”部分尚不在内。据美联社南京九日电称：该项征实约为米三百万吨（按：约合六千六百万石），自十月一日起征。此数字系根据“总动员会议”上的估计。该电并称：蒋政府除军粮征购及征实外，且将田赋附加、征粮及追收历年欠粮。一般认为：蒋介石这种敲骨吸髓的勒索，将无限加深蒋管区灾荒，把蒋管区人民抛到饥饿死亡深渊，从而必将逼起人民救死的抗争。
    【新华社华中十一日电】沪报讯：蒋政府对南通土布业又增额外苛征，较去冬激增十余倍。去冬的“地方特税”小布每匹二十元，三十码改良布七十元。目前以所谓“地方补助费”名义，小布每匹苛征二百元，大布五百元，三十码改良大布竟征至千元。南通土布业在苛捐杂税下，势将加速破产了。
