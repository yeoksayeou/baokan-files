　　Changzhi City Factories Inspect Production
　　Improving Quality and Quantity Simultaneously
　　[Our News] On June 21st, the Changzhi City directly-affiliated factories, through the Competition Committee, in coordination with the Municipal Party Committee, Municipal Government, and other agencies, a total of 30 people in five groups, conducted production inspections at various factories. Lasting three days, a summary meeting was held on the 24th at the Municipal Trade Union. Managers and Trade Union directors of various factories participated. After the groups reported, discussions were held, mainly focused on absorbing experiences, raising questions, and solving problems. First, achievements: This time, the plans were realistic and after supplementary planning, the workers’ thinking was greatly enlightened, and improved a step over the pre-May Day movement. 1. In terms of quantity, the Zhenhua Handicraft Cooperative's soap department increased production per person per day from 1 1/3 boxes to 3 70/100 boxes; the Huasheng Factory increased towel production from 90 dozen to 100-110 dozen, and socks from 120 dozen to 140 dozen; the Xiabeijie Poor People's Textile Factory increased from weaving 4.8 zhang of cloth per day to 6 zhang, and the paper mill increased from producing 4.5 districts of single paper per day to 4 districts of double paper. 2. In terms of quality, in the textile industry, the excellent quality and durability of Yihucheng’s products are generally recognized, and from the sales perspective, the goods are not enough to sell, which is sufficient proof. Others, such as Xiabeijie Poor People's Textile Factory, Huaqiang’s cloth, and Zhenhua's soap, have all improved considerably. The Workers' Cigarette Factory has greatly expanded its sales after improving quality. 3. In terms of technical improvement and tool modification, Comrade Chang Yue, the manager of Zhenhua Handicraft Cooperative, created a yarn joining machine, saving 12 man-days per day. Li Jiangxi of the spinning department, after modifying the toothed wheel himself, increased wool spinning from 5 jin to 10 jin. The Ceramics Research Institute fired bright ceramics. Huasheng repaired and modified its own vest machines. Cui Heipang of Yihucheng made his own felt machine and large shuttle. The paper mill's electric mill can save seven animal power. The textile factory in the 11th Li added oil beads to the iron machine wheels, increasing output. These all fully demonstrate the limitless talent and creativity of the masses. 4. In terms of improving workers' thinking and the relationship between superiors and subordinates, the apprentices of the Xinhua Paper Mill were afraid to raise their opinions on wages until the Trade Union director returned. The Huasheng workers, under the bold leadership of Manager Cao Fukui, made this year's production campaign very enthusiastic. At the same time, he consciously established the prestige of the Trade Union and improved the working ability of Trade Union cadres. 5. In terms of learning, Ren Tiancheng of Huaqiang, in addition to completing his daily production tasks without delaying Trade Union work, has learned more than 100 characters from "May Day" to now. Although Ren Ligong is over 70 years old, he has also learned more than 20 characters. Secondly, Huasheng, the Paper Mill, and others have established a regular learning system. Second, experiences: 1. From summing up and checking experiences, solving problems, and combining ideological checks, putting forward one's own shortcomings from top to bottom, supplementing plans, breaking ideological barriers and concerns, and promoting the entire movement (such as Yihucheng), etc. 2. Scientific organization of labor, allocation of technology, reduction of costs, and increase in production volume (such as Zhenhua Handicraft Cooperative). 3. Cultivate apprentices boldly and respect teachers; allow workers a certain amount of time and cost to study technology. 4. Flexible management adapts to the market and strengthens seasonal production, such as Yihucheng changing all foreign socks to vests and hand towels to fancy felt. Third, future directions: Strive to complete the plan by "August 1st" and use our output to support the front lines. 1. Improve technology, exchange technology, respect masters, and train a large number of new workers (overcome our old habit of simply increasing time and increasing production without paying attention to technological improvement). Reward researchers and inventors, give researchers appropriate time and research funds, and create a mass movement to overcome the view of simply transforming from an ideological perspective. 2. Accurately calculate costs, capital, labor, and technology, and organize the preparation in detail to ensure sufficient raw materials, low costs, and wide sales channels. 3. Learn culture and politics, improve the management capabilities of cadres, and improve the political awareness of the masses to achieve conscious worker management of factories, consolidate and expand revolutionary factories, and implement Chairman Mao's instructions.

　　长市各厂检查生产
  　品质数量同时提高
    【本报讯】长治市直属各工厂于六月二十一日，由竞赛委员会，配合市委、市政府等各机关，共三十人，分五组分别到各工厂进行生产检查，历时三日，最后于二十四日，在市工会召开了检查总结会议，有各工厂经理工会主任参加，各小组汇报后，展开了讨论，主要以吸收经验，提出问题，解决问题为中心。第一，成绩：这次订计划切合实际，又经过了补充计划，在职工思想上有很大的启发；比五一前的运动提高了一步。一、数量上，振华工艺社肥皂部每人每日由出一箱又三分之一，提高到三箱又百分之七十；华盛工厂出手巾由九十打提高到一○○打至一一○打，袜子由一二○打提高到一四○打；下北街贫民纺织厂，由每天织四丈八尺布提高到六丈，纸厂由每天造四区半单纸提高到双纸四区。二、质量上，从纺织业来说，义合成的产品，品质优良、耐用是众所公认的，从销路上看，货不够卖，足以证明。其他如下北街贫民纺织厂、华强的布，振华的肥皂，都有相当的提高，职工烟厂，在提高质量后，销路上大大的宽广了。三、技术提高和工具的改造上，振华工艺社经理常悦同志，创造了合线机，每日节省人工十二个，纺线部李江喜经自己改造牙轮后，纺毛线由五斤提高到十斤，磁业研究所烧出了透亮的磁，华盛自己修理和改造了背心机，义合成崔黑胖，自己做毡机和大梭子，纸厂用电碾可省畜力七个，十一闾的纺织厂在铁机轮里加油珠，提高了产量。这些都充分的证明了群众有不可限量的天才和创造。四、职工思想的提高和上下之间的关系；新华造纸厂的徒弟，对工资有意见不敢提，等工会主任回来才提出，华盛工人是在经理曹富奎大胆放手下，使今年的生产运动情绪非常高涨，同时他有意识的树立工会的威信，提高工会干部的工作能力。五、学习上，华强任天成，除每天完成生产任务不误工会工作外，从“五一”到现在识了一百多个字，任立功虽已七十多岁了，也还认了二十多个字，其次是华盛、纸厂等已建立了经常的学习制度。第二经验：一、从总结检查总结经验、解决问题、结合思想检查，由上而下提出自己的缺点，补充计划，打破了思想上的隔核和顾虑，推动了整个运动（如义合成）等。二、科学的组织劳力，配备技术，减低成本，增加生产量（如振华工艺社）。三、培养徒弟要大胆放手，要尊重老师；让工人有一定的时间和代价研究技术。四、经营灵活适应市场，加强季节性的生产，如义合成由洋袜全部改成背心，由手巾改成花线毡。第三、今后的方向：争取到“八一”完成计划，拿我们的产量立功支援前线。一、提高技术，交流技术，尊重师傅，大量培养新工人，（克复我们的单纯增加时间，增加生产，不注意技术提高的老习惯。）要奖励研究与创造发明者，给研究者适当的时间与研究费，造成群众性的运动，克服单纯从思想上改造的观点。二、要精确计算成本、资金、劳力、技术，组织备配要细密，做到原料足，成本低，销路广。三、学习文化和政治，提高干部经营管理能力，提高群众的政治觉悟，做到工人自觉的管理工厂，巩固和扩大革命工厂，做到毛主席的指示。（长市导报）
