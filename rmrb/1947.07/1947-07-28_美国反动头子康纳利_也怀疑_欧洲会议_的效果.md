This reactionary Democratic Party foreign policy leader, as famous as Republican Gordenberg, has expressed deep doubts about the results of the "European Economic Recovery Conference" instigated by Marshall. Connally stated: "I highly doubt whether European countries are cooperating sufficiently to make a joint plan work." "I do not believe that any plan proposed by the European Economic Recovery Conference is the best and most effective for solving the current situation." Connally opposed excessive "relief plans" and applying the "Marshall Plan" to Asia.

　　美国反动头子康纳利
  　也怀疑“欧洲会议”的效果
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】据路透社华盛顿讯：美参议员康纳利于十九日晚发表“外交政策”的广播演说。这一个与共和党的戈登堡齐名的反动的民主党外交决策的主持人之一，已对马歇尔所策动的“欧洲经济复兴会议”的结果深表怀疑。康氏称：“我非常怀疑欧洲各国是否充分合作以使共同计划行得通。”“我不相信欧洲经济复兴会议提出的任何计划，对解决目前局势是最好和最有效的。”康氏反对过分的“救济计划”和将“马歇尔计划”应用于亚洲。
