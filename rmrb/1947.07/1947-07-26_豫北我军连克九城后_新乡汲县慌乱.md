Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 24th: According to people coming from Xinxiang: After the People's Liberation Army in northern Henan launched a counter-offensive and continuously captured nine cities, Xinxiang, an important garrison town of the Chiang army, is in extreme disorder. Recently, the airport caught fire, the gasoline depot burned clean, and one airplane was also destroyed. The relatives of Chiang's officials have fled south one after another. Along the railway line between Xinxiang and Jixian and around the city, laborers are being seized to rush to repair fortifications; trees within a radius of forty to fifty miles have been felled. Chiang's army is plundering everywhere, and pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks in the suburbs and the city have all been robbed and eaten. Women have also been raped. The people are gnashing their teeth with anger and eagerly looking forward to the early liberation by our army. The Taihang Edition of the New China Daily is circulating in the streets, and Chiang's military police cannot prohibit it.

　　豫北我军连克九城后
    新乡汲县慌乱
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十四日电】据新乡来人谈：豫北人民解放军发动反攻连克九城后，蒋军重要屯兵之新乡，秩序已极紊乱，最近飞机场失火，汽油库燃烧净光，并焚毁飞机一架。蒋家官员眷属，纷纷南逃。新（乡）汲（县）间铁道沿线及城周，正抓夫赶修工事；方圆四五十里之树木已砍伐殆尽。蒋军四出扰掠，城郊城内猪羊鸡鸭俱被抢走吃光。妇女亦遭奸污，人民怒目切齿，热盼我军早日解放。新华日报太行版流传街头，蒋家军警也无法禁止。
