　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th -- According to incomplete statistics from newspapers in the Chiang-occupied areas: since May, the wave of people seizing rice and intercepting grain has swept through over 38 large and small cities (excluding several cities in northern Henan and western Suiyuan) and vast rural areas in the nine provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Sichuan, Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan, with over 170,000 people participating. As of the previous month, the masses involved in the grain-seizing disturbances have begun to form regular organizations. For example, the famine victims who launched the grain-seizing movement in Fugug County, northern Shaanxi, in early June have organized themselves into a fixed grain-seizing team. In Gao Township, Wuhu, a grain-seizing team of over ten thousand people has also been formed. The grain-seizing disturbances have spread across the vast areas of Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest in Chiang Kai-shek's rear for the civil war. The vast majority of disturbances broke out in the heartland of Chiang Kai-shek's rule, including Chiang Kai-shek's capital Nanjing, the first commercial port Shanghai, Wuxi in Jiangsu, one of China's four major rice-producing areas, and Suzhou, Kunshan, Songjiang, Chongming, Pukou, Siyang, Hangzhou, Wuxing, Shaoxing, Qu County, Yongkang in Zhejiang, Hefei and Anqing in Anhui, Wuhu, one of the four major rice-producing areas, and Xuancheng, Ningguo, Jingde, Jixi, Shexian, Jingxian, Guangde, Yichang and Jiangshan in Hubei, Chengdu in Sichuan, Luxian (a rice-producing area), Rongchang, Neijiang, Guanxian and Luojiang and Emei, Beiping, the military and political center of the Chiang family in North China, several cities and rural areas in northern Henan, Fugu and Shenmu in northern Shaanxi, Sarachi and many towns and villages and the fertile Hetao area in Suiyuan. The scale of the disturbances was enormous, with participation reaching 50,000 in Hefei, 40,000 in Hangzhou, over 10,000 in Wuhu, over 10,000 in Anqing in the disturbance against purchasing military grain, and several hundred or thousands in the rest. The disturbances demonstrated the Chiang-controlled area people's extreme resentment towards the Chiang government's rule. The masses in Wuxi once surrounded the county government and removed the county government's signboard to parade it. The masses in Chengdu surrounded the municipal government and planned to rush into the provincial government. The masses in Anqing smashed the residence of the head of the Chiang's bank in the county. An old woman in Yichang, while seizing rice, cried out: "We can't print banknotes. We haven't had rice in our stomachs for days. Please save us!" Many mass disturbances demonstrated a spirit of fearlessness. In May, the Chiang government in Chengdu ordered its military police to "kill without mercy" the rice-snatching masses, and before July 5, more than a dozen starving people had been shot and over a hundred arrested, but the disturbances continued to occur, reaching five times by the 12th of this month. The rice-snatching disturbances in Hefei and Wuxi were carried out in a hail of bullets.
