　　Changzhi News: In this spring's great production campaign in Changzhi, new methods of integrating agriculture and sideline occupations, and industry and agriculture, have been created under the principles of mutual assistance and mutual benefit, ensuring that both industry and agriculture are not neglected, and that industry and agriculture are both convenient. In terms of industry-agriculture integration, mixed industry-agriculture mutual aid groups were organized. Farmers cultivated land for workers, and workers provided funds to help farmers engage in sideline occupations and purchase livestock. The profits earned were distributed according to a 30/70 or 20/80 split, with industry receiving 20 or 30 percent and agriculture receiving 70 or 80 percent. Farmers were paid wages at the rate of the mutual aid group for their land cultivation. For example, in the Zhang Qilou mutual aid team in Henghe, eight out of twenty-three households were workers. The workers provided funds to buy six head of livestock and handed them over to the farmers to feed, with the farmers responsible for fodder. Farmers cultivated land for workers, and in addition to being paid wages, the profits earned by the workers were distributed according to a 20/80 split, with industry receiving 20 percent and agriculture receiving 80 percent. In the Zhangjiagou Zhang Lianxi team in the Fifth District, there were thirteen laborers, seven working in the kiln and six cultivating land. During the busy farming season, women and children also went to the fields. When there was spare time, they engaged in transportation. Transportation work was credited at twelve points, while working in the kiln was credited at fifteen points for profit sharing. In villages where there were more workers than farmers, in addition to organizing a large number of auxiliary laborers, workers also allocated a certain amount of labor to the fields during the busy farming season, and their wages were higher than those of mutual aid workers.
　　In terms of integrating agriculture and sideline occupations, some villages, as a unit, exchanged labor based on the nature of the work to free up labor for production. For example, the mat weaving cooperative in Zhan Shang Village, First District, purchased raw materials and promoted finished products in an organized manner. Compared with the previous method of each person managing their own affairs, it saved 3,000 workdays in five months, which could produce 3,000 more mats, worth 1.8 million yuan; and saved 300,000 yuan in travel expenses, totaling 2.1 million yuan. The cooperative's handling fee was at most 100 yuan per mat, and the profits were distributed among the masses. In Huo Village, the entire village selected ten people and three head of livestock for transportation, and four people to operate a flour mill. The cooperative extracted a portion of its shares as production capital, and the land of those engaged in sideline occupations was cultivated by the mutual aid group, which paid wages. The profits earned from sideline occupations were distributed throughout the village. The Dongjia Village Cooperative regularly prepared some goods and organized surplus labor to go out and do business at any time, and half of the profits were distributed. Some mutual aid groups, as a unit, extracted a portion of their labor to engage in sideline occupations. For example, after sowing seeds, the Bi Eryun team in Suhou extracted two head of livestock for transportation. Labor and animal power were recorded and paid wages separately. The profits earned were distributed according to the number of work points for participation in the war effort, supporting the war effort, and agricultural work for the entire group. In the Zhao Liuzhi mutual aid team in Nansong, Fifth District, seven laborers extracted two people to sell eggs for cotton in Quwo. The land was cultivated by the mutual aid group, and labor was exchanged for labor. Each time, 3,000 yuan was offered as a reward to those who carried the loads, and the remaining profits were distributed throughout the group. (Ren Ying@)

　　长治生产运动中的农副、工农结合办法
    【本报长治讯】长治今春的大生产运动，在互助互利、工业农业两不误工农两方便的原则下，创造出农副结合工农结合的新办法。在工农结合方面，组织工农混合互助组，农民给工人种地，工人拿出钱来帮助农民搞副业买牲口、赚下钱按三七或二八分红，工二或三农七或八，种地按互助组工资付足农民。如横河张起楼互助队，廿三户中有八户工人，工人拿出钱来买牲口六头交给农民喂，草料支差由农民担负。农民给工人种地，除按工资偿付外，工人所赚的钱按二八分红、工二农八。五区张家沟张连喜组，十三个劳力七个下窑六个种地、农忙时妇女儿童也上地。有空搞运输，按运输顶十二分下窑顶十五分分红。工人多农人少的村庄，除大批组织辅助劳力外，农忙时工人也抽出一定劳力上地，工资高于互助工资。
    在农副业结合方面，有以村为单位的，按工作性质不同进行变工，省出工来搞生产。如一区湛上村席子合作社，有组织的购买原料推销成品，较之过去各管各的办法，五个月省工三千个，能多打三千条席子，合洋一百八十万元；节省盘费三十万元，合计二百一十万元。合作社手续费顶多每条一百元，得利还由群众分红。霍村是全村抽出十个人三头牲口搞运输，四个人搞粉房，合作社抽出一部分股金作生产资本，搞副业人的地由互助组种，出工资。副业挣下钱全村分红。东贾村合作社则经常预备一些东西，随时组织剩余劳力出去做买卖，赚钱时半分红。有以互助组为单位，抽出一部分劳力搞副业。如苏后毕二云组下种后，抽出两头牲口运输。按人力畜力记分付工资，各清各项，赚下钱按全组参战、支差、农业等各项用工分数分红。五区南宋赵六只互助组中七个劳力抽出二人，到曲沃卖鸡蛋换棉花，地由互助组种，工顶工，每次提出三千元奖挑担的人、其余赚钱全组分红。（任映＠）
