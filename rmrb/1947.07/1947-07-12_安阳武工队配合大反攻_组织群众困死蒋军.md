    【Reported from Anyang】Coordinating with the counter-offensive, the enemy in Anyang is tightly surrounded by our militia guerrilla brigades, experiencing great difficulties in their daily lives. From the 23rd to the 30th of last month, they attempted to seize grain from villages such as Daxiaopo, Xujiakou, and Xiaomingtun six times, but each time they were met with fierce resistance from our militia and forced to flee in disarray. Wang Yong's explosives squad and Li Anyuan's militia company from the 9th District fought particularly well. They frequently and proactively operated in areas such as Boli, Wencun, and Zhongcheng, recovering over 1,000 catties of smuggled grain from treacherous merchants. They also captured Bi Sheng, the son of enemy stronghold leader Bi Wenxi, and handed the scoundrel over to the masses. On the 25th, in coordination with the guerrilla brigade, they laid out a Big Dipper minefield near Sanlitun. Coincidentally, the enemy came out to seize grain at dawn and suffered a severe blow from our mines and snipers, fleeing back in a panic with eight dead and wounded, without seizing a single grain. In these seven days, our militia guerrilla brigade killed a total of thirteen enemy soldiers, including a machine gun and artillery platoon leader, and wounded seven.

    【Another Report】The militia of the 1st District and the guerrilla brigade of the 7th District in Anyang are now rushing to the outskirts of Anyang city to besiege the enemy and constantly conduct guerrilla activities. In the course of these activities, they have greatly expanded their political offensive, propagating our victory and the aim of starving the enemy inside the city. At the same time, they are educating the people to hide their grain well, ensuring a tight siege by the masses. Under the premise of "everything for the great counter-offensive," they have displayed the greatest enthusiasm and creativity. Ren Wenliang's guerrilla brigade, through propaganda about victory and starving the enemy, has established intelligence relations, mobilized the masses to transform the streets, helped reorganize the self-defense forces, and established sentry posts. The militia of the 7th District, without affecting the war effort, are systematically helping the masses with production. Thirteen people, in thirteen days, helped the masses hoe more than twenty mu of land without compensation. The people in that area happily said: "They are truly the militia of the people!"
