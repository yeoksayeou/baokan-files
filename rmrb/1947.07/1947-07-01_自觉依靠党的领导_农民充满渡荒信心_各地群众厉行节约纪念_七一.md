　　[Our Newspaper, Licheng News] After two nights of branch symposiums to commemorate the Party's birthday, Beiliu Village reviewed its leadership in resisting drought and preparing for famine. It unanimously decided to use practical actions to greet and commemorate "July 1st." Then, it quickly went deep into the poor and hired peasants and all farmers in a scattered manner, taking individual visits and small-scale symposiums to conduct drought resistance inspections. On the night of the 20th, a village-wide gathering of men and women was held. Comrade Liu Jianfu, the county secretary, called on all farmers and party members to resolutely respond to the Party's call, carry out the drought resistance and famine relief campaign, and welcome and commemorate "July 1st." Farmer Zhang Fukui followed closely, saying: "In the ninth year of the Republic of China, no one cared about anyone else, and everyone sold whatever they had. In 1943, Chairman Mao called for production, thrift, and gathering wild vegetables to overcome the famine. If there was no Communist Party, half of us poor people would have starved to death long ago. Now we have turned ourselves around again. This year's drought is already a reality, and we must never leave the Communist Party's call at any time. Whoever does not follow the call will fall off the cliff!" Aunt Sanhu said: "In 1943, I received thirty catties of chaff grain from the public relief and managed to survive the famine. Thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership, I didn't starve to death."

　　Then everyone reviewed the famine relief experience of 1943. Zhou Kaoxian said: "In 1943, the main thing was to work hard. This year, we must pay attention to production and thrift as soon as possible, dig canals, gather vegetables, and protect seedlings." Spinning hero Liu Zhongjing said: "This year, we can be tough! In 1943, we didn't know how to weave, and we survived the famine by spinning wool. This year, everyone knows how to do it, and if we manage the pot well and save carefully, we can overcome the famine." Finally, labor hero Li Choulou called on everyone to respond to the Communist Party's call, pay attention to deep plowing and careful cultivation as soon as possible, protect the seedlings well, replant where there are not enough seedlings, prepare early for late-sowing seeds, free up labor to dig canals and water seedlings. Through precise calculations, surplus labor and livestock power should be extracted to transport and exchange grain, women should redouble their efforts in spinning and weaving to sell cloth and buy grain, and every household should ensure that they weigh salt and carry coal without selling grain, and that every person in the village saves four taels of rice per day, and that every household stores some bran. Intensify the collection and storage of vegetables, mutual aid teams do not eat collectively, and women do not visit relatives or celebrate the full moon. Everyone should make contributions to commemorate "July 1st." The villagers enthusiastically passed his proposal, and each mutual aid team launched a challenge competition. (Peiyi)

　　Also Reported: Nan Guan held a forum for liberated farmers on the night of the 24th of this month to discuss how to commemorate "July 1st." Everyone unanimously said: We must take practical actions to commemorate the Communist Party's birthday and respond to the Party's call - production and thrift to overcome the famine. Li Changcheng said: "That year, I relied entirely on picking eight hundred catties of thorny joint vegetables and fermenting two large jars to survive the famine." Zhang Shuiwang said: We should first hand in public grain and plan for thrift. Wang Xueqin, a relative of a revolutionary martyr, said: "Not only should we be thrifty, but we must also vigorously support the front line in digging up old roots." Wang Changyu said: "When people are in trouble, they think of their benefactors. The Communist Party is always there for us farmers, and is a loyal and reliable friend of us farmers, helping us to turn ourselves around. When the drought comes, it calls on us to be thrifty and prepare for famine. Even the best housekeeper would not take care of us like this. The Communist Party is only twenty-six years old this year, and it has done so many good things for us farmers, and established such a united, democratic, and free big family. Today the drought is so serious, but we still eat pancakes after half a day of wheat harvesting. This is not good. Not being thrifty and being wasteful is letting down our benefactor Chairman Mao and the Communist Party." After such recollections, some people with complacency of waiting for rain were enlightened. Finally, everyone decided: 1. Pick more wild vegetables and add more bran. 2. Eat less white flour. 3. Turn thick food into thin food. 4. Every household must be thrifty to overcome the famine. (Xisheng, Liduan)

　　[Our Newspaper, Shexian News] Under the call to welcome "July 1st" and present gifts to the Party, the party members and masses of the first district have made remarkable achievements in drought resistance and famine relief work. Wang Yuque, a woman from the association, said: "Listening to Chairman Mao and the Communist Party is never wrong." She immediately formulated a thrift plan, saving one catty of rice per day for her family of three, and weaving five feet of cloth per day herself. After summing up the history of struggle, the Beishui Village branch led the masses to carry water and plant thirty mu of jade corn and one hundred and thirty-one mu of dry seeds. The branch committee of Zhang Village in the rear Kuanshan mobilized the masses to sell bean sprouts, selling two dan and five dou within twelve days, earning 152,000 yuan. The village chief and political director mobilized five women day and night to organize a textile group, spinning six catties of thread and weaving three zhang of cloth in thirteen days. In mobilizing for famine preparation, the masses of Yantou Village and Shentou Village attacked the landlords' "blockhouses," cleared out six landlords from the cooperative, and completely separated from the landlords. The masses rose up to manage the cooperative themselves. After making meritorious service, Sihe Township led the villagers to collect five thousand catties of vegetables (dried vegetables). Now, a movement of making meritorious service has been launched in all villages in the district, and presenting gifts to the Party has become a common slogan of action. (Chongzhi, Qingrong)

    各地群众厉行节约纪念“七一”
    【本报黎城讯】北流村经过二夜的支部座谈纪念党的生日，检讨对抗旱备荒的领导，一致决定用实际行动来迎接纪念“七一”，接着便很快深入分散到贫雇及全体农民中去采取个别访问小型座谈等形式，进行抗旱检查。二十日夜召开全村男女集会，县书刘健夫同志号召全体农民及党员坚决响应党的号召，开展抗旱渡荒运动，迎接和纪念“七一”。农民张富魁紧接着说：“民国九年谁也不管谁，有啥卖啥。四三年毛主席号召生产节约采野菜渡过了灾荒。如没有共产党，咱穷人早已有一半饿死啦，现在咱又翻了身，今年旱灾已成，千万要时刻不离开共产党号召，谁不跟号召走，谁就往崖里跌！”三虎妈妈说：“我四三年领了公家放的义粮三十斤糠谷才算渡过灾荒，多亏毛主席领导没饿死。”
    接着大家回顾了四三年渡荒经验，周考贤说：“四三年主要是好好劳动，今年就得及早注意生产节约，开渠采菜，保护青苗。”纺英刘仲景说：“今年可腰硬啦！四三年不会纺织，光纺毛线还渡过灾荒，今年人人都会，加上掌握锅边好好节约定能渡过灾荒”，最后劳动英雄李丑犊号召大家响应共产党号召，及早注意深耕细作，好好保护青苗，不够苗的要补种，及早准备晚种籽改茬，腾去劳力开渠浇苗。通过精确计算，抽出剩余劳畜力运输换粮，妇女们要加倍纺织卖布买粮，家家做到秤盐驮煤不卖粮、全村每人每天节省四两米，户户存一部糠。加紧采菜、储菜，互助组不集体吃饭，妇女不走亲戚，不望满月。人人立功纪念“七一”。全村群众热烈通过他的提议，各互助队并掀起挑战竞赛。（培义）
    又讯：南关于本月二十四夜召开翻身农民座谈会，讨论如何纪念“七一”，大家一致的说：我们要拿实际行动来纪念共产党的生日，响应党的号召——生产节约渡荒。李长成说：“那年我全凭采了八百斤刺节菜，还沤了两大缸，才渡了荒。”张水旺说：咱先缴公粮并要计划节约。抗属王雪芹说：“不光节约，还得很好支援前线刨老根。”王常余说：“人到难处想恩人，共产党时刻为咱农民，是咱农民的忠实可靠的朋友，帮助咱翻身，旱象新来又叫咱节约备荒，就是怎好的当家也不这样照管咱，今年共产党才二十六岁，给咱农民办了多好事，建立了这样一个团结民主自由的大家庭，今天旱灾这样严重，咱割麦半晌还烧饼吃，这样可不行，不节约还浪费就对不起恩人毛主席共产党。”经过这样回忆，启发了一些等雨麻痹自满思想，最后大家决定：一、多采野菜多掺糠。二、少吃白面。三、稠的吃成稀的，四、家家都要节约渡荒，（喜生、利端）
    【本报涉县讯】一区各村支部党员群众在迎接“七一”给党送礼的号召下，抗旱渡荒工作做出显著成绩。会里妇女王玉确说：“听毛主席共产党的话，永没错。”立即订出节约计划，全家三口一天节省一斤米，自己一天织五尺布，北水村支部总结斗争历史后，党员领导群众担水栽玉茭三十亩，干种一百三十一亩。全村后宽山章村支委发动群众卖豆芽，在十二天内卖了两石五斗、赚洋十五万二千元，村长政治主任白天黑夜动员了五个妇女组织一个纺织小组，在十三天内纺线六斤，织布三丈。沿头村神头村在发动备荒中群众打了地主的“炮楼”，从合作社清出了六个地主，和地主彻底分了家，群众起来自己管理合作社。四合乡立功后领导全村群众采菜五千斤（乾菜）。现在全区各村都掀起了立功运动，给党送礼已成普遍的行动口号。（崇智、庆荣）
