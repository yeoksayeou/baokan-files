All occupied villages in the county, except for Malan and Diaolingguan, have been recovered. On the 4th, the Second District guerrilla force, in coordination with local armed forces, destroyed the Jiang-controlled township government in ＠Zuzi, killing or wounding 40 people including the township head, scaring the Jiang-controlled township head of Qiutou in the neighboring district into fleeing overnight. The Malan District guerrilla force often ambushes around Malan, forcing the enemy to dare not easily go out to operate. Xu Wenyu, a Jiang-controlled Bao chief, was shot and killed by the guerrillas when he ventured eight li outside of Malan. Under the cover of the militia guerrillas, the masses in various localities are rushing to plant autumn fields.

    游击队活跃
    新华社西北十一日电陕甘宁关中分区新正县群众游击战极为活跃。全县除马栏及雕翎关外，被占乡村已全部收复。二区游击队在四日配合地方武装，摧毁＠咀子蒋记镇公所，毙伤该镇长以下四十人，吓得邻区湫头蒋记镇长连夜逃走。马栏区游击队经常在马栏四周设伏，迫使敌人不敢轻易外出活动，蒋记保长许文友越出马栏八里，即遭游击队击毙。各现地群众在民兵游击队掩护之下，正纷纷抢种秋田。
