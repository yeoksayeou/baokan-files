Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 2nd. The "Li Da" fishing boat from Yantai, which was seized by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents from Qingdao in early November of last year, successfully escaped on May 16th thanks to the heroic struggle of the boatmen. They captured a Chiang's official, two guards, three rifles and pistols, more than 1,200 boxes of fresh fish, and other materials, with a total value of over 30 million Northern currency. Note: After Chiang's army captured the "Li Da" last November, they vigorously publicized the "defection of the Communist fishing boat."

    【新华社山东二日电】去年十一月初为青岛蒋特虏去之烟台利大号渔船，在船夫英勇奋斗下，于五月十六日胜利脱险归来，并俘获蒋记官员一名，卫士两名，长短枪三支，鲜鱼一千二百余箱，及其他物资一部，价值共约北币三千万元以上。按：去年十一月蒋军捕去“利大号”后，曾大肆宣传“共军渔船投诚”。
