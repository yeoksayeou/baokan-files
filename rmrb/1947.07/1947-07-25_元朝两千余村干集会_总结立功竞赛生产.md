　　Yuan Dynasty Holds Meeting of Over Two Thousand Village Cadres
　　Summarize Merit-Based Competition and Production
　　[Our newspaper's report from Southern Hebei, 20th] Over two thousand five hundred village cadres in the Yuan Dynasty, at a conference summarizing merit-based achievements and promoting production, were overjoyed to hear the good news of the great counter-offensive. They were all excited and resolved to take a fighting stance, do a good job in various rear area tasks, participate in the counter-offensive, and welcome "August 1st" [Army Day]. On the same day, villages made plans, and cadres in various districts, under the call of "Production and Economy, Participate in the Counter-Offensive," launched a merit-based challenge. Zhang Junjie, representing the Third District, challenged the Fifth District with eight points: (1) Save 480,000 jin of grain in the second half of the year. (2) No village should leave an acre of land uncultivated, achieving an increase of 10 jin of grain per person, and accumulating 10,000 cartloads of fertilizer. (3) Guarantee that the land of the families of soldiers is cultivated better than that of the masses, etc. The Fifth District responded loudly and added new conditions: accumulate 115,000 cartloads of fertilizer, organize 135 flour mills, capable of producing 20,000 pieces of starch noodles per day, etc., along with six points, and launch a merit-based model movement. They will also manufacture accelerated spinning wheels, with 25% of the spinning wheels in the district being modified. Then, Chief Han of the Seventh District challenged the Third District. In other district challenges, in addition to the general conditions, the Fourth District proposed organizing 20% of the women, guaranteeing that no landlord would be missed in each village. The Sixth District proposed that model cadres would guarantee to take the lead in participating in production. There are currently 18 model workers, and it is guaranteed that 30 more model workers will be added in the second half of the year. The First District proposed that district cadres personally take the lead in production, organize 250 mutual aid teams, and guarantee that not an acre of land is left uncultivated, with the land hoed four times. After the challenges were completed, the two thousand five hundred cadres returned to their villages with victorious feelings to specifically organize the competition movement.
