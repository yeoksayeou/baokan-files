Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 17th: Half-Month War Situation (from July 1st to 15th):

    Following the Northeast Democratic Allied Army's continuous 50-day powerful summer offensive, General Liu Bocheng's ever-victorious army launched an offensive on the entire Jilu豫 (Jìlǔyù) front on the eve of "July 1st," kicking off the prelude to the People's Liberation Army's major counter-offensive. On other battlefields, the Chiang troops were also passively beaten, with only a desperate so-called "key offensive" in a corner of Shandong, but even this "key offensive" was initially hit. The entire war situation has undergone tremendous changes, and the national war situation is about to enter a new stage.

    On June 29th, General Liu Bocheng's east and west armies simultaneously attacked the two wings of the Pinghan Railway. The main force on the western front first captured the four cities of Fengqiu, Yanjin, Huaxian, and Junxian on the 29th. On July 4th and 5th, after annihilating more than 2,000 enemies, they also captured the two cities of Bo'ai and Qinyang, immediately isolating the enemy in Xinxiang. The eastern army, greeted by millions of people north and south of the Yellow River, on the moonlit night of June 30th, with the assistance of brave sailors from eight counties and under the cover of fierce artillery fire, broke through Chiang Kai-shek's Yellow River natural barrier, which was claimed to have 400,000 troops, in one fell swoop on a 300-li wide front, easily capturing Juancheng. Immediately afterwards, the main field force was deployed, and on the 7th, Yuncheng was captured, completely annihilating the 55th Division headquarters and the 74th and 29th Brigades of the Chiang army, killing and capturing more than 15,000 troops. Li Mingya, the deputy commander of the 55th Division, hid in the sorghum fields to be searched by local armed forces, and the commander, Cao Fulin, barely escaped with his life. On the 10th, the 155th Brigade of the 62nd Division, newly transferred from Guangdong, was annihilated, and Dingtao was recovered. On the same day, taking advantage of the capture of Tai'an by our army in East China, Pingyin and Feicheng were successively recovered. At that time, the Ji皖苏 (Jǐ Wǎnsū) troops active south of the Longhai Railway immediately rose up in response, and within three days from the 8th to the 10th, they successively recovered the three cities of Luyi, Hao County, and Taikang, controlling several highway lines south of the road. Overall, since the dispatch of Liu Bocheng's army, in eleven days, it has completely annihilated one division headquarters and three regular armies of the Chiang army, totaling more than 20,000 troops, broke through the Yellow River natural barrier, the He(ze)济(nan) Highway, and the three lines of defense of the Chiang army from Kaocheng Dingtao to Jinxiang, and captured 17 county towns, scaring the Chiang army out of their wits and hastily deploying defenses on the Longhai Railway. But this is only the initial test of General Liu Bocheng's sharp edge, and we expect that even greater triumphant news will soon be reported to the people of the country.

    If General Liu Bocheng has started a major counter-offensive, the East China Liberation Army has severely hit Chiang's unprecedented desperate major offensive. Chiang Kai-shek, due to successive defeats on various battlefields and internal crises, in order to save his declining situation, concentrated the forces of nine reorganized divisions on the Laiwu-Xintai line from June 25th, advancing side by side from west to east, attempting to cut off the connection between the central and southern Shandong liberated areas, and swallow up the main force of the East China Liberation Army in one fell swoop, in order to free up forces to deal with General Liu Bocheng's army. However, the East China Liberation Army, known for its mobility and combat effectiveness, while blocking the enemy at every turn, annihilating 3,000 enemies, took advantage of the enemy's rear emptiness and launched offensives towards the Jiaoji Railway and the Jinpu Railway. The former annihilated more than 2,000 enemies in the county area in two days and nights, and the latter captured Tai'an on the 8th. At the same time, another main force, with the momentum of a heavenly soldier descending, inserted into the side and rear of the Chiang army in one fell swoop, annihilating all of the 38th Brigade of Feng Zhi'an's army and one regiment of the 37th Brigade of the Chiang army on the 7th, and capturing Feixian. In just ten days, Chiang Kai-shek's "huge" offensive, organized with great effort, suffered a heavy blow. Now the East China Liberation Army and General Liu Bocheng's southern expeditionary army have echoed each other from afar, and it is already difficult for Chiang Kai-shek to organize a new major offensive of 300,000 to 400,000 people, and time is running out.

    On the Northwest battlefield, a part of the main force of the Northwest People's Liberation Army advanced towards the Sanbian Division at the end of last month. Ma Hongkui, in view of the mistakes of Ma Bufang and Ma Hongbin in the Longdong area, did not dare to fight a single round, abandoned his armor, and fled with his tail between his legs. The Liberation Army then recovered Dingbian on June 30th, Anbian on July 1st, and Yanchi on the 7th. Recalling when Hu Zongnan attacked Yan'an, the three Mas came rushing in, thinking that they could get a share of the pie from Hu, but they ended up suffering. With the three Mas gone, there is still one fox (Hu) sitting and waiting for the end.

    Coordinating with the counter-offensive of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Liberation Army in Sanbian, the Jinxi Liberation Army annihilated all of the 216th Regiment of the 72nd Division of Yan's army, more than 2,000 people, in Xiaozhen, south of Wenshui, on July 4th, capturing more than 1,600 people, including the regimental commander and deputy regimental commander.

    There has been no major battle in the Northeast in the past half month. One day, the Democratic Allied Army repelled the newly formed cavalry army of the Chiang army south of Yinping, and on the 3rd, it annihilated a part of the 207th Division of the New Sixth Army of the Chiang army in Heishimu, south of the Shenji Line. After being severely attacked by the Democratic Allied Army for 50 consecutive days, the Chiang army in the Northeast has completely lost confidence, and there is a scene of chaos within. Family members of Chiang's officials in Shenyang and other places are crowding onto trains to flee to the mainland. Du Yuming, Zheng Guo, and Sun Liren shirk their responsibility for the defeat and slander each other. Chen Cheng hurriedly flew to Shenyang to collude with Sun Liren to attack Du Yuming. This once-prominent General Du Yuming was ashamed to see anyone and eventually asked for leave due to illness. Even Dong Xianguang, the director of the Nanjing Chiang's News Bureau, was nervously shouting that the Democratic Allied Army was about to launch an offensive.

    In the Jin-Chahar-Hebei area, the People's Local Corps launched an attack on the pseudo-strongholds on the periphery of Baoding on the 27th of last month, and by the 7th, it had annihilated more than 1,600 local armed forces of Chiang.

    The storm of the People's Liberation Army's all-out counter-offensive is coming, and the days of the people's trial of war criminals are not far away. What cards do Chiang Kai-shek, who is trembling with fear, and his chief of staff have to play now? They have played two cards: one is called "total mobilization." Chiang Kai-shek had already been totally mobilized long ago. Now this "total mobilization" is nothing more than an attempt to demoralize the military, concentrate the will of the reactionaries, and beg for help from his master, the United States. But everything is determined by the war on the front lines. Just when Chiang Kai-shek "totally mobilized," he suffered more and greater defeats on the battlefield. In this way, his morale will only get worse, and the internal affairs of the reactionaries will only become more chaotic. Although the United States has some aid, it will never be able to save the collapse of this decaying ruling structure. The second trump card is to blow up the Yellow River dikes, flooding the people and the Liberation Army in the liberated areas on both sides of the river. In order to cover up this conspiracy, in late June, Chiang and the US jointly proposed a so-called ceasefire on both sides of the Yellow River to confuse the public. According to yesterday's news: Chen Cheng suddenly submitted a memorandum to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), saying that the government army would not "ceasefire," and notified that "UNRRA's dike restoration personnel in the Communist army area should withdraw immediately, otherwise the government will be responsible for any accidental damage suffered by the dike restoration personnel." In fact, Chiang Kai-shek has never ceased fire. This memorandum only shows that Chiang Kai-shek's initial dissemination of this so-called "ceasefire" smokescreen was aimed at creating a pretext for indiscriminately bombing the dikes and flooding the people and attempting to prevent the People's Liberation Army from advancing. The so-called "flood tactics" can only be used as a life-saving treasure by the most despicable and shameless feudal remnants, like Chiang Kai-shek, when they are dying. The People's Liberation Army, which relies on the people as its backing, will surely smash this poisonous plan and send Chiang Kai-shek, who used this poisonous plan, into the grave.

### 全国战局将进入新阶段  刘伯承将军锋刃初试将有更大捷报  人民解放军全面反攻风暴即将来临

    全国战局将进入新阶段
    刘伯承将军锋刃初试将有更大捷报
    人民解放军全面反攻风暴即将来临
    【新华社陕北十七日电】半月战况（自七月一日至十五日）：
    紧接着东北民主联军连续五十天的强大的夏季攻势，刘伯承将军麾下常胜军于“七·一”前夜在冀鲁豫全线发动攻势，揭开人民解放军大反攻的序幕。其他战场蒋军也都被动挨打，只有在山东一隅还作了一次绝望性的所谓“重点进攻”，但即此“重点进攻”也受到初步打击。整个战争形势业已发生巨大变化，全国战局行将进入新阶段。
    六月二十九日，刘伯承将军东西两路大军同时向平汉路两翼出击。西路主力首于二十九日攻克封邱、延津、滑县、浚县四城，并于七月四、五两日，在歼敌二千余后，还下博爱、沁阳两城，顿使新乡之敌陷于孤立。东路大军在黄河南北千万民众夹道迎送下，于六月三十日月明之夜，由八个县的英勇水手协助，以猛烈炮火为掩护，五分钟时间内，于三百里宽正面，一举突破蒋介石号称四十万大军的黄河天险，垂手取得鄄城。旋即展开野战主力，于七日攻克郓城，全歼蒋军五十五师师部及七四、二九两旅，毙俘一万五千余众，五十五师副师长理明亚匿迹高粱地为地方武装搜索，师长曹福林仅以身免。十日，再歼甫自广东调来之六二师一五五旅，克复定陶。同日乘华东我军攻克泰安之便，相继收复平阴、肥城。其时，活跃于陇海路南的冀皖苏部队即奋起呼应，于八、九、十日三天内，连续光复鹿邑、毫县、太康三城，控制路南数条公路交通线。综观自刘伯承大军出动以来，十一天内已全歼蒋军一个师部、三个正规军共二万余众，突破黄河天堑、菏（泽）济（南）公路及考城定陶至金乡之蒋军三道防线，连克县城十七座，吓得蒋军丧魂落魄，仓促在陇海路布防。但这还只是刘伯承将军锋刃初试而已，我们预料不久将有更大捷报传告国人。
    如果刘伯承将军开始了大反攻，华东解放军则严重打击了蒋军一次空前的绝望性的大攻势。蒋介石由于各战场节节失利，内部危机四伏，为挽救其颓败局势，乃自六月二十五日起，于莱芜、新泰一线集中了九个整编的兵力，由西向东齐头并进，企图切断鲁中、鲁南解放区的联系，一举吞没华东解放军主力，以便抽出力量对付刘伯承将军的大军。但以机动善战闻名的华东解放军，一面节节阻击，歼敌三千，并乘敌后方空虚，分向胶济路与津浦路展开攻势，前者在县地区二昼夜歼敌二千余，后者于八日攻克泰安。同时，另一部主力以奇兵天降之势，一举插入蒋军侧后，七日歼灭蒋军冯治安部三十八旅及三十七旅一个团全部，攻克费县，九日席卷枣庄、驿县、兰陵、向城、卞庄。不过十天时间，蒋介石费了九牛二虎之力组织的一次“庞大”攻势，就遭到沈重的打击。现在华东解放军与刘伯承将军南渡大军已经遥相呼应，蒋介石再要组织新的三四十万人的大进攻已经很困难了，时间是来不及了。
    西北战场，西北人民解放军主力一部于上月底向三边分区挺进，马鸿逵鉴于马步芳、马鸿宾在陇东地区的覆辙，未敢交一回合，曳兵弃甲，撒腿而逃，解放军当于六月三十日收复定边，七月一日收复安边，七日收复盐池。回忆胡宗南进攻延安时三马对冲而来，满以为大可以向胡蛮分得一杯羹，结果却自讨苦吃。遁去三马，尚剩一狐（胡）在坐待末日。
    与陕甘宁解放军反攻三边配合，晋县解放军七月四日于文水南孝镇歼灭阎军七二师二一六团全部二千余人，生俘团长副团长以下一千六百余人。
    东北方面半月来无大战，一日民主联群于阴平南击退蒋军新编骑兵军，三日于沈吉线南黑石木歼灭蒋军新六军二○七师一部。东北蒋军经民主联军连续五十天的痛击后，现已完全失去信心，内部呈一片混乱现象。沈阳等地蒋记官员家眷接踵摩肩挤上火车往关内逃跑，杜聿明、郑国、孙立人相互推卸败战责任，你倾我轧。陈诚慌忙飞赴沈阳，勾结孙立人打杜聿明。此显赫一时之杜聿明将军无颜见人，终至称病告假。连南京蒋记新闻局长董显光也神魂不定的惊叫民主联军又将发动攻势。
    晋察冀方面，人民地方兵团于上月二十七日向保定外围伪据点出击，至七日歼灭蒋记地方武装一千六百余人。
    人民解放军全面大反攻的风暴即将来临，人民审判战争罪犯的日子已不远，心惊手颤的蒋介石和他的参谋总长现在还有什么牌可打呢？他们连打了两张牌：一张叫做“总动员”。本来蒋介石早已总动员了，现在这个“总动员”无非企图颓丧士气，集中反动派意志与向主子美国乞援。但一切决定于前线的战争，就在蒋介石“总动员”的时候，他在战场上的的败仗却吃得更多更大，这样他的士气只会更糟糕，反动派内部只会更混乱；美国虽有若干援助，也决无法挽救这一周身糜烂的统治机构的崩溃命运。第二张王牌是炸毁黄河河堤，水淹两岸解放区人民和解放军。为了掩护这一阴谋，六月下旬蒋美由联总提出所谓黄河两岸休战的建议，以迷惑视听。根据昨天消息：陈诚突以备忘录一件送交联总，说政府军不“休战”了，并通知“联总派遣共军区域内复堤工作人员应即日撤退，否则复堤人员遭受意外损害时，政府负责。”其实蒋介石从来也没休战过，这个备忘录只说明蒋介石当初的散发这一所谓“休战”烟幕，目的是在制造往后滥炸河堤水淹人民与企图阻挡人民解放军前进的口实。所谓“泛滥战术”，只有最卑鄙无耻的封建余孽，一如蒋贼才会在垂死时当救生宝贝来运用，倚恃人民为后盾的人民解放军一定能粉碎这毒计，将施用这条毒计的蒋贼送进坟墓里去。
