　　Lü Fenglin Leads Deeply
　　Struggle Unfolds in Xiaojin Township
　　1. Tears Flow Outward, Bitterness Buried Within.
　　Comrade Lü Fenglin, with fervent enthusiasm, arrived in Xiaojin Township to visit the peasants and inquire about their suffering. Initially, he didn't find the suffering of the masses; instead, he saw tears welling up in their eyes upon seeing him. Comrade Lü affirmed in his mind: "Where there are tears, there is suffering; the tears have already flowed outward, and the bitterness is still buried within." Therefore, he resolved to overcome all difficulties and mobilize the masses of this village.
　　2. Utilizing Administrative Power to Understand the Village Situation.
　　Lü Fenglin originally intended to hold a mass meeting, but due to the sabotage of counter-settlement elements and the Bao-Jia chief, people didn't gather, and the meeting couldn't be held. He quickly changed his approach. He called the Bao chief into the room, forced him to report who the targets of the struggle were, and intimidated him with strong words: "I have already investigated and know clearly who the targets of the struggle are in your village, and how many families there are. Now I am testing whether you are telling the truth. If you don't tell the truth, you are protecting them." At first, the Bao-Jia chief hesitated and didn't want to tell everything, but after the Bao chief said one, Lü Fenglin pretended to compare it with his notebook, and after comparing, he continued to pursue. As a result, twenty-one targets of the struggle were all spoken from the Bao chief's mouth. Lü Fenglin recalled that during training, the people from this village who had received training had said: "The land that was struggled out last year was not distributed before the enemy came. The grain was distributed." He thought that those who distributed the grain must be poor peasants. If he summoned them, they would definitely not dare to come. So he ordered the Bao chief to tell the villagers to conduct a large-scale household registration, and stipulated several items: name, age, amount of land, whether grain had been distributed, and whether they had participated in the peasant association. At first, the masses were not very enthusiastic about registering. On the one hand, he had the Bao-Jia chief beat the gong, and on the other hand, he had those who had registered go around to persuade others. The whole village knew that Comrade Lü, the worker, had come to register households. If they didn't register, wouldn't they become blacklisted? As a result, more and more people registered, filling the courtyard to the brim, and the registration lasted until dark. It was found that there were one hundred and twenty-eight households that had distributed grain in the past. Lü Fenglin didn't even bother to eat a meal that day. He announced to everyone at the time: "Households that have not distributed grain should all go back. Households that have distributed grain should stay temporarily." He gathered the people who stayed and held a short meeting. He said: "Why did I keep everyone? Because we are our own people. Of course, our own people should speak frankly. I came for no other reason than to see if everyone has suffering. If you have suffering, who should you tell if not your own people? But it's late today, and the meeting can't be held. Let's hold it again tomorrow. When we, our own people, hold a meeting, we can't let the Bao-Jia chief notify us, let alone beat the gong." Everyone said, "Of course." With everyone's agreement, eight groups were formed, and disciplines were stipulated on the spot: "Whoever doesn't come is a 'leak' (a vent for the evil landlords)." After the meeting, in order to understand some specific materials, so that he could mobilize tomorrow, Lü Fenglin left the activists he knew during the household registration and asked about the counter-settlement situation in the past. From the mouths of these activists, it was revealed that the female chairman of the peasant association, Bai Lin, had been killed by the enemy troops. The grain had all been returned to the people, and everyone had been punished.
　　3. Moving Away the Stone, Mobilizing the Poor and Hired.
　　The next day after breakfast, the masses came without being called. He began to mobilize everyone, saying, "Why did the enemy leave Chongyi (Xiaojin Township is eight miles away from Chongyi, which is an enemy stronghold. At the beginning of the Yubei Campaign, when the enemy retreated from this stronghold, they were severely beaten by us)?" Then he explained that the enemy had few soldiers and couldn't take care of it, so they had to leave. He analyzed the strength of the enemy and ourselves from near to far. He also strictly reviewed that it was wrong for us to run away to the mountains last year, leaving everyone behind. This time, we will die with everyone, and we will never go to the mountains again, and wholeheartedly lead everyone to turn over and take revenge. When he said how the chairman of the peasant association, Bai Lin, died, the meeting place became so quiet for a while, and some people shed tears, all reminiscing about Bai Lin who had led them to turn over in the past. In such an emotionally charged situation, Lü proposed to avenge Bai Lin and settle accounts with the evil landlords. Everyone should tell their own people what they have in mind. After speaking, everyone was still divided into eight groups to let everyone pour out their suffering. After grouping, you looked at me, I looked at you, and only said that Comrade Lü was right, but no one poured out their suffering. Lü began to get a little anxious, but then he saw the reason. He found that four people were going to various groups to wander around, saying everywhere: "The Eighth Route Army is coming, and we must fight, and we can't do without fighting." Lü immediately gathered the group leaders and asked why they didn't pour out their suffering, but the group leaders didn't express their attitude. Lü asked, "What about those who are wandering around everywhere?" They said, "They were not good in the past." Lü asked again, "What about now?" They said, "Now it's nothing." Lü found out from the mouths of the group leaders the reason why everyone didn't pour out their suffering. Lü immediately detained the four people and explained to everyone: "I don't understand the situation. It turns out that we still have 'leaks' here. No wonder everyone is afraid to speak." After detaining these four people, everyone looked happy, and then there was a burst of noise in the meeting place. After re-grouping to let everyone pour out their suffering, someone began to pour out their suffering. An old woman poured out that her daughter-in-law was beaten to death by the evil Wu Zhongzhi (who had served as a puppet team leader). When Wu Zhongzhi was struggled against last year, his wife secretly gave 30,000 yuan, and when the enemy came, all the money was returned to the people, and even two dou of wheat from his home were carried away. When Wu Guoying poured out that her daughter was buried alive by the evil, almost everyone in the audience was crying. After a while of pouring out their suffering, everyone became depressed again. Lü then gathered the group leaders and those who had poured out their suffering and said: "Everyone has suffering, why do we only pour it out and they don't? If others don't pour it out, will they be of one mind with us? Everyone should immediately collude and let everyone have suffering to pour out." After everyone's collusion, typical examples were selected, and another mass meeting was held to pour out their suffering. After repeated efforts several times, almost everyone was involved in the suffering movement, and a total of fifty-two people poured out their suffering more deeply.
　　4. Believing in the Masses, Boldly Letting Go.
　　It was almost dark when the suffering was being poured out. Lü asked everyone: "Is it okay to just pour out the suffering?" Everyone answered in unison: "No." Lü said: "What should we do if it's not okay?" Everyone said: "We must fight." Lü said: "Yes, we must fight, but I am very unfamiliar with our village. I don't know who to fight, how to fight, whether to fight heavily or lightly. It's all up to you."
　　Comrade Lü Fenglin went out and asked the Bao-Jia chief to detain all the struggle objects (except those who ran away). While everyone was still discussing how to fight tomorrow, Lü came in with the struggle objects. Everyone was very excited after seeing them, saying, "Do these people have today too?" Lü locked this group of struggle objects in the room, and Lü said to everyone: "You see how you should fight tomorrow? I am responsible if they run away." Everyone answered Lü Fenglin: "Lao Lü, don't worry, we will guarantee a good fight tomorrow. We are responsible if the fight is not good." The peasant association was established on the spot, and the chairman was elected.
　　5. The Eyes of the Masses are Sharp, and the Punishment is Fair.
　　The struggle meeting was about to begin on the third day. The masses walked into the meeting place in groups. Some people held wooden sticks in their hands. When everyone arrived, the rational struggle against the evil landlords began. The masses poured out their suffering while holding wooden sticks, and questioned the wife of the evil landlord Wu Wanhui (who had served as a puppet district chief) and said: "Was it right for us to fight you before?" She answered in a small voice: "Yes." Everyone said: "Say it loudly, say it to everyone." Wu's wife turned to everyone and said: "Yes." "Why did you take the grain back when the enemy troops came?" Wu's wife replied: "I was wrong, I will return it to everyone when the wheat is harvested." The masses angrily said: "Why didn't you wait for the wheat to be harvested before settling accounts?" Wu's wife had nothing to say, and everyone gave her a good beating with wooden sticks. When it was the turn of the struggle object Li Fenglin's mother, Zhang Yongxing said: "Because your son was the Bao chief, I owed you ninety catties of wheat, and I was fined one stone and four dou if I was late for a few days..." This angered everyone and caused her to be beaten with wooden sticks. Everyone saw Wu Zhongzhi's wife, who colluded with the enemy to kill the chairman of the peasant association, Bai Lin, and without saying a word, beat her with wooden sticks again and again. On the fourth day, the land that was struggled out was distributed. A total of 360 mu of land was struggled out and distributed to 92 poor and hired households. Everyone happily said: "The evil landlord has grown wheat for us, who would have thought that it would be our turn to harvest it!" When the fruits were distributed, the peasants excitedly said: "It's the world of us poor people again." (Communication from Wen County Fourth District)

### 吕凤林深入领导　小金乡掀起了斗争

　　吕凤林深入领导
  　小金乡掀起了斗争
  　一、泪流在外，苦埋在心。
    吕凤林同志抱着满腔的热情到了小金乡找农民去访苦，开始他没有访到群众的苦，却看见了群众见了他夺眶而出的眼泪。吕同志思想上肯定了：“有泪就有苦，泪已流在外面，苦还埋在心里。”因之下定决心，要冲破一切困难，非把这个村的群众发动起来不可。
    二、运用行政力量，了解村里情况。
    吕凤林本来想开个群众大会，因倒算分子和保甲长的破坏，没集合起来人，会没开成，他很快改变了办法，他把保长叫在屋里，强制他报告出谁是斗争对象，并以大话吓唬他说：“你们村里谁是斗争对象，共有几家，我早就调查清了。现在试试你说实话不说，不说就是包庇。”保甲长开始还吞吞吐吐不想一齐说出，可是保长说出一个，吕凤林假装与笔记本上对照的样子，对照之后，再往下追，结果二十一家斗争对象，全从保长口里说出了。吕凤林想起在训练班的时候，这村受训的人说过：“去年斗争出的土地没来及分敌人就来了，粮食是分了”。他想到分粮食的必然是贫苦农民，如果召集他们，他们一定不敢来。于是命令保长，让他告诉全村群众要进行户口大登记，并规定了几个项目：姓名、年龄、土地多少，分过粮食没有，是否参加过农会。开始群众来登记的不很踊跃，他一方面让保甲长打锣，一面让登记过的人去串通。全村里都知道人家吕工作员来登记户口，不来登记，不是成黑人了吗？于是登记的越来越多，把院子挤的满满的，整整登记到天黑才完了。查出过去分过粮食的有一百二十八户。吕凤林一天连饭也没顾上吃，当时向大家宣布了：“没分过粮食的户口一律回去，分过粮食的户口暂时留下”。把留下来的人集合起来，开了个简短的会议。他说：“为什么把大家留下？因为咱是自己人，自家人当然要说知心话，我来不为别的，就是来看看大家有苦没苦？你们有苦不向自己人说，向谁说呢？可是今天天晚了，会也开不成啦，明天咱再开吧，咱们自己人开会，可不能让人家保甲长去通知，更不能让人家打锣。”大家说：“那当然啦”。又经过大家的同意，编成了八个小组，当场规定纪律说：“谁不来是漏缝（恶霸地主的透气筒）。”会散了，吕凤林为了了解些具体材料，明天好作动员，把在户口登记中认识的积极分子留下，又问了问过去倒算情形，从这些积极分子口里，才透露出女农会主席白林，让顽军给杀了。粮食都退给人家了，并且每人都受了罚。
    三、搬开石头，发动贫雇。
    第二天早饭后，大众果然不用叫都来了，他开始向大家作动员说：“崇义（小金乡距崇义八里是敌人的一个据点，豫北战役开始，敌人从这个据点撤退时，被我们痛痛打了一顿），敌人为什么走了？”接着他又解释说，敌人兵少顾不过来，不得不走。他由近及远分析了敌我力量，他又严格检讨了我们去年逃跑上山，丢了大家是不对的，这次我们死也和大家死在一起，决不上山了，忠心领导大家翻身报仇。当他说出农会主席白林是怎样死的，会场里一时变的那样肃静，有的流出泪来，都在追念过去领导他们翻身的白林。吕在这样群情激动的情况下，提出了要给白林报仇，要向恶霸地主算帐，大家有啥心思话，都应该给自己人讲。话讲完之后，仍按八个小组让大家诉苦。分组后，你看看我，我看看你，只说吕同志说的对，而没有人诉苦。吕开始有些着急，后来看出原因，他发现有四个人到各组串来串去，到处说：“八路军来了非斗不可，不斗也不行。”吕当时把小组长集合起来，追问不诉苦的原因，可是小组长并不表示态度，吕问：“那几个到处串的人怎样？”他们说：“过去是不好”。吕又问：“现在如何呢？”他们说：“现在也算没啥”。吕从小组长口里找出大家不诉苦的原因了，吕当即把四个人扣起来，向大家说明：“我不了解情况，原来我们这里还有漏缝，怪不得大家有话不敢说。”扣起这四个人后，看见大家有说不出来的高兴，接着会场一阵的喧嚷，再分组让大家诉苦，就有人诉起来了。一个老太太诉到了自己的儿媳妇被恶霸吴中智（当过伪队长）打死，去年斗争吴中智，他老婆暗给三万元，敌人一来，全数给人家退回了，连家里二斗麦子也让人家背走了。吴国英诉到自己闺女被恶霸活埋时，全场几乎没人不流泪的，诉一阵大家又消沉下去，吕便召集小组长和诉过苦的人说：“大家都有苦，为什么光咱诉他们不诉呢？别人不诉会不会和咱们成了一条心呢？大家应该马上串通，让大家都能有苦诉。”经过大家的串通，选择了典型，又开大会诉苦，这样反复搞了几次，几乎人人卷入了诉苦运动，诉的较深刻的计有五十二人。
    四、相信群众，大胆放手。
    诉苦诉到天快黑了，吕向大家提出：“光诉苦中不中？”大家应口回答说：“不中”。吕说：“不中怎样办？”大家说：“非斗不行。”吕又说：“对，就是非斗不行，不过我在咱村很生，该斗谁，怎样斗，斗重，斗轻我可不知道，全由大家啦”。
    吕凤林同志出去让保甲长把所有的斗争对象（除跑掉的）一起扣起来。大家还正在讨论明天如何斗的时候，吕带着斗争对象进来了，大家看了以后，兴奋极了，说：“这些人也有今天吗”？吕把这批斗争对象关在屋里，吕又向大家说：“你们看明天该怎样斗就怎样斗吧？跑了由我负责”。大家回答吕凤林说：“老吕你放心吧，明天保证斗好，斗不好由俺负责”。当场成立了农会，选出了主席。
    五、群众眼睛雪亮，惩罚轻重公平。
    第三天斗争会就要开始了，群众成群结队的往会场里走，有的手里拿着木棒，人到齐了，向恶霸地主的讲理斗争开始了。群众一面诉苦，一面手执木棒，质问恶霸地主吴万虎（过去当过伪区长）的老婆说：“俺以前斗你对不对？”她用细小的声音回答：“对”。大家说：“大声说，对着大家说。”吴妻面转向大家说：“对”。“对为啥顽军来了你把粮食又重要走？”吴妻答：“我错了，等麦子打下来再还大家”。群众气愤的说：“你为啥不等麦子打下来，再倒算呢？”吴妻没话可说了，大家让他饱尝了一顿木棒。轮到斗争对象李凤林他妈，张永兴说：“仗你儿子当保长，我欠你麦子九十斤，迟还了几天，就罚我一石四斗………。”激怒了大家，使他吃了两阵木棒，大家看到了勾结敌人残杀农会主席白林的吴中智老婆，话就没说，用木棒一阵一阵的打起来。第四天分配斗争出的土地，斗出土地共三百六十亩，分配给九十二户贫雇，大家高兴的说：“恶霸地主给咱种好了麦子，谁想到轮到我们收割呢！”分配果实时，农民兴奋的说：“又是咱穷人的天下了。”（温县四区通讯）
