Experiences in Land Reform in Jilu
    Zhang Yutang
    From the cadre-mass meeting on April 26th to June 15th, in fifty days, 40 of the 119 administrative villages in Jilu have initially realized "land to the tiller." Another nine villages are in the midst of struggle, and 38 villages are beginning to prepare. The following main experiences were gained in the work:

    (1) Adhere to the land reform policy, closely integrate with participation in the war, mature the preparations while participating in the war, and return home to carry out the struggle. Initially, because of participation in the war, some district cadres had thoughts of waiting and procrastination. For example, they said: "There is no one in the village now, so we can't do it. We have to wait until the masses come back." There was also a type that only did land reform and did not care about participation in the war, saying, "This is not the business of the peasant association," and so on.

    The leadership discovered these problems and promptly commended the Third and Fourth Districts and Comrade Mao Shunkun, who had integrated participation in the war and land reform well, and put forward slogans such as "Men participate in the war, women pour out their grievances, participation in the war and land distribution are not delayed," and "Do the work of however many masses there are" in the villages. During this period, the work was very successful. For example, on the way to Yongji, Zhai Baofa, accompanying the army with a stretcher, not only explained policies and current affairs but also enlightened the coolies to pour out their grievances with actual examples of the time and place. After the coolies participating in the war returned, they were organized to tell about the lives of the people in the areas occupied by Chiang, the atrocities of the Chiang army, how good the Eighth Route Army was, and how capable they were in fighting, etc., which helped the masses at home to break through their thoughts, expose the rumors of the special agents, and promote the rapid development of the movement.

    (2) Large-scale training of landless and land-poor peasants and cultivation of backbones is an effective way to quickly prepare for a comprehensive struggle. Each district simultaneously gathered and trained hired farm laborers and poor peasants. After returning to the villages, some of them acted as liaison persons for extensive connections, and some cooperated with cadres to hold village training classes. Facts have proved that the more people trained in a district or village, the faster and more widespread the movement developed in that district or village. Because there were more people during training, they were bolder, and their worries were easily broken through. For example, a hired worker in Haoyu Village was unwilling to come for training when the village asked him, but when he was about to leave after the training, he told Comrade Ji Fu: "I will do it even if I die." When these people returned to the masses, they enlightened everyone with their own ideological awareness, and their own suffering aroused everyone's suffering. In less than a day, the preparations matured, and the masses immediately demanded to carry out the struggle, demanding quick struggle and quick distribution. The struggle and pouring out of grievances were very intense, without sleeping for two or three nights. They said: "Are you still confused when dividing the fruits?!"

    (3) In order to enable the masses to master the policy and dare to take action further, various meetings were held, such as counter-reckoning grievance meetings, middle peasant meetings, fear and fear-relief meetings, face-washing and merit-establishing meetings, women's grievance meetings, heart-to-heart and unity meetings...etc. Through various meetings, the ideas that poor peasants are afraid of being isolated and middle peasants are afraid of struggle were broken, and special agent rumors were exposed. After the masses dispelled their worries, they also created many methods. For example, in Langjia'ao, the leadership enlightened the masses to use the method of recalling war experiences to solve the fear of "seesaw" thinking. After everyone's casual talks and recollections, they said: Thinking of the great strength of the stubborn army last year, even the Jilu militia did not deal with them. If they had troops, why didn't they reinforce when the Eighth Route Army fought in southern Shanxi for two months? For example, in solving the problem of fear of counter-reckoning, the Third and Fourth Districts were cleared up by summarizing the experience of counter-reckoning. Two points were clearly summarized: (1) In villages such as Daduilei, where the militia is active regularly and the masses are united, the struggle is thorough, and there has been no counter-reckoning. (2) As in Yuandong Village and Zhou Village, because the bad guys were not eliminated in the past, the counter-reckoning was severe. A mass said: "Last time our village had no militia, and the landlords counter-reckoned. Now we must organize a militia." For example, the old man Wang Yuhong poured out his grievances at the mass meeting: "I have never participated in the peasant association. When the die-hards came, they said I was in the peasant association and insisted on killing me. It cost a lot of money to save me." Zhou Cun Sanzhi said: "What struggle or no struggle, peasant association or no peasant association, anyway, the bad guys want to cheat you. When they see an old man, they say it's the peasant association; when they see a young man, they say it's the militia; when they see a woman, they say it's the women's team. Anyway, there is no life for the poor." In this way, everyone realized that only struggle can bring about a turn over, and only thorough struggle will prevent the bad guys from doing evil and not be afraid of the seesaw.

    (4) Support the masses and embolden them, set typical examples, and struggle in every village. In the newly recovered areas, the masses have experienced suppression, massacre, and counter-reckoning by the enemy, special agents, and landlords, and now they are still sabotaging secretly and spreading rumors to threaten the masses. The peasants have great worries. Therefore, in order to break these worries, in addition to mainly mobilizing the masses from the bottom up, it is necessary to support the masses and embolden them in all aspects. For example, the masses in many villages said: "The enemy is in front of us, we dare not do it. We must detain ××." For example, the First District was afraid of alarming the enemy and dared not detain them. The detained were released, and they wanted to win back the counter-reckoning culprits who had run away, which resulted in the masses being afraid of leniency. Some special agents and landlords were at large, threatening the masses and preventing them from acting. In the Third District, the leadership detained more than 20 cases according to the opinions of the masses, and also held a mass public trial of war criminals and culprits in the whole district. The county magistrate spoke to the masses, explaining that the government would never be lenient to bad guys, and that the handling of cases would be based on the opinions of the masses. The militia reported the achievements of suppressing the culprits and "compiling villages" for counter-reckoning during the war, and announced that the militia is the armed force of the peasants, and whoever is a bad landlord, the militia will deal with them. At this meeting, the counter-reckoning landlord Wang Xishan was immediately struggled against. The next day, the masses in six villages, including Bao'ertou, Langjia'ao, Luzhuang, and Zhoucun, all rose up to struggle. (Taiyue Branch)

    稷麓土地改革经验
    张玉堂
    稷麓自四月二十六日的干群会议，到六月十五日五十天中，一百一十九个行政村中已有四十个行政村初步实现了耕者有其田。另有九个村正在斗争，三十八个村开始酝酿。工作中获得如下主要经验：
    （一）坚持土地改革方针，密切结合参战，在参战中酝酿成熟，回家进行斗争。起初因为参战，某些区干部产生等待和推诿思想。如说：“现在村上没人，不能搞，等群众回来才行。”还有一种只做土地改革，不管参战工作，说“这不是农会的事情”等等。
    领导上发现了这些问题，及时表扬了参战与土地改革结合好的三、四区和毛顺坤同志，并提出参战中训练酝酿，在村里做到“男人参战女人诉苦，参战分田两不耽误”，“有几个群众做几个群众的工作”等口号。这个时期中，工作是很有成绩的。例如翟保发随军担架到永济路上，除讲解政策时事外，又以当时当地实际例子启发民夫诉苦。参战民夫回来后，把他们组织起来，讲述蒋占区人民生活、蒋军暴行，八路军怎样好，能打仗等等，帮助了在家群众打通思想，揭破了特务造谣，推动了运动迅速开展。
    （二）大规模训练没地少地农民，培养骨干，是迅速酝酿全面斗争的有效办法。各区同时集训雇贫佃农，回村后，他们有的作连络人大串通，有的配合干部召开村训班。事实证明，那区那村集训的人多，那区那村的运动发展得快而普遍。因训练时人多胆就壮，顾虑易破。如蒿峪村一个雇工，村里要他来受训时，他不愿意，而受罢训临走时告吉孚同志说：“我死也要干哩”。这些人回到群众中去，用自己的思想觉悟启发大家，以自己的苦引起了大家的苦，不到一天，酝酿成熟，群众马上要求进行斗争，提出快斗快分，斗争诉苦劲儿很大，两三夜不睡觉。他们说：“分果实还迷糊哩？！”
    （三）为了使政策为群众所掌握，更进一步敢起来行动，召开各种会议，如反倒算诉苦会、中农会、害怕与解怕会、洗脸立功会、妇女诉苦会、谈心团结会……等。经过各种会议，打破贫农怕孤立、中农怕斗争等思想，揭破特务谣言，群众解除了顾虑以后，也创造了许多办法。例如在朗家凹，领导上启发群众用回忆战争经验的办法，来解决怕“拉锯”思想。经过大家漫谈回忆，说：想起去年顽军那么大的力量，连稷麓民兵都没收拾了，他若有兵，为甚八路军打晋南两个月了，他不增援？又如在解决怕倒算思想问题上，三、四区是总结反倒算经验打通的，明确总结了两条：（一）在大小堆垒等村，有民兵经常活动，群众团结一条心，斗争彻底，都没被倒算。（二）如元东村、周村，因坏家伙过去没打掉，倒算的厉害。一个群众说：“上一次咱村没民兵，地主倒算了，现在咱们非组织民兵不行。”又如王玉红老汉在群众大会诉苦：“我没参加过农会，顽固来了说我是农会，非杀不行，花了许多钱，才救出来。”周村三知说：“什么斗争不斗争，农会不农会，反正坏家伙要想讹你，见了老汉是农会，见了青年是民兵，见了妇女是妇女队，反正没穷人过的日子。”这样使大家认识到只有斗争才能翻身，而且斗争彻底，坏家伙就不敢为非作恶，才不怕拉锯。
    （四）给群众撑腰壮胆，典型示范，村村斗争。在新收复区，群众曾经过了敌人、特务、地主镇压屠杀倒算，而现在他们还在暗中破坏、造谣威胁群众，农民顾虑非常大，因而打破这些顾虑，除主要自下而上的发动群众外，必须从各方面给群众撑腰壮胆才行。如许多村群众说：“仇人在跟前，我们不敢干，非把××扣住不行。”如一区怕打草惊蛇，不敢扣，已扣的放回去，想把跑了的倒算祸首争取回来，结果造成群众怕宽大，有些特务地主逍遥法外，威胁着群众不敢动。而在三区领导上根据群众意见，扣了二十多个案子，又召开全区群众公审战犯祸首大会，县长给群众讲了话，说明政府对坏家伙决不宽大，处理案子根据群众意见。民兵报告了在战争中镇压祸首“编村”反倒算的成绩，并宣布民兵就是农民的武装，那个地主坏，民兵就要收拾那个。在这个大会上，马上斗争了倒算地主王锡山。第二天就有堡儿头、朗家凹、吕庄、周村等六个村群众都起来斗争了。（太岳分社）
