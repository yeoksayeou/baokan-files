    Zhangnan New District
    Expanding the Farmers' Association Through Mutual Aid in Rush Planting
    [From our Jinnan Office, 14th] After the peasants of Cheng Tianbao Village in the Zhangnan New District initially turned themselves around, they expanded the Farmers' Association through mutual aid in rush planting. After the rain in late June, Kang Jinzhi, the director of the Farmers' Relief Association, said at the group leaders' meeting: "Today's rain is only partially penetrating. If it's sunny for a few days, the seedlings may not emerge well. We should hurry to plant together and strive to finish planting the land of our Farmers' Association in three days." Everyone agreed, and each group challenged each other, setting off a rush planting boom. Livestock pulled plows, and people pulled rollers. In a three-day blitz, all the planting was completed, totaling more than 980 mu. Members said: "There are many poor people in our Farmers' Association. We don't have enough cattle, donkeys, or seeds. Without mutual aid, we couldn't have done it so quickly. This way, everyone is harmonious and can do more work." Female member Jia Yangshi said: "My family has neither cattle nor donkeys, and it's not easy to find people to help. If it weren't for the Farmers' Association, it would be very difficult. In previous years, I always planted after others had finished. This year, even pulling the roller is a good deal." People who were not in the Farmers' Association encountered difficulties during the rush planting, such as not being able to find cattle, donkeys, or people. They saw the benefits of the great mutual aid among the Farmers' Association members with their own eyes. Therefore, after the rush planting, they joined the Farmers' Association one after another, saying: "The Farmers' Association helps us vent our anger and take revenge, and also manages the distribution of land and things. It also makes it easier for us to plant. The Farmers' Association is really good." In two days, 38 people signed up. Now the Farmers' Association has grown from 114 people to 175 people.

    互助抢种中扩大农会
    【本报冀南十四日电】漳南新区程天保村农民初步翻身后，从互助抢种中扩大了农会。六月下旬雨后，农救主任康金枝在小组长会上说：“今天的雨半透，晒几天恐怕出不好苗，我们应赶快互助抢种，争取咱农会的地三天种完”。大家同声赞成，各组互相挑战，掀起抢种热潮，牲口拉耧，人拉砘子，三天突击，全部种完，共计抢种九百八十多亩，会员纷纷说：“咱农会里穷人多，牛驴种籽都不齐全，不是互助，可不能这样快，这样大家又和气又能多做活”。妇女会员贾杨氏说：“我家牛驴啥也没有，找人也不好找，要不是在农会可很作难，往年都是人家种完俺才种，今年虽拉砘子也上算”。不在农会的人在抢种中有的找不着牛，有的找不着驴，有的找人等遇到困难，他们亲眼看到农会员大互助的好处，因之抢种后纷纷参加农会，都说：“农会管咱出气报仇，又管分地分东西，还管咱种地不作难，农会真好”。两天内报名者达卅八人，现农会已由一百一十四人发展到一百七十五人。
