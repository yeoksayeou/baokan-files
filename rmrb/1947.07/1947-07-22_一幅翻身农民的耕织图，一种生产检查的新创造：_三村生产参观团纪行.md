　　I. How it was Organized
　　Changzhi Second District held a spring plowing mobilization meeting in Nandong on April 18th. SuDian, Jiajiazhuang, and Nantianhe challenged each other to achieve "plowing two, surplus one" [a goal of plowing two-thirds of one's land and having a surplus of one-third]. At that time, it was stipulated that there would be three inspections: spring plowing and sowing, weeding for summer harvest, and autumn harvest and plowing. After sowing, because Jiajiazhuang was hit by hail, the inspection was not carried out on time. The masses in Sudian and Tianhe reflected, "They're fooling us. What they said doesn't count, and there's no inspection." When the cadres of the three villages heard this, they felt they couldn't let the masses down, so they came up with a way to organize a three-village visiting group to inspect each other's work through mutual visits.
　　On June 2nd, after some discussion in the district, everyone understood that the purpose of the visit was to promote work, help the backward, exchange experiences, and strengthen the relationship between the emancipated peasants of the three villages. It was also agreed that the main items for the visit were to see how well intensive cultivation (especially for families of soldiers), agricultural and sideline industry integration, and organizational leadership were being carried out. So the three villages nominated more than twenty people, and the visiting group was organized.
　　On the afternoon of June 4th, Nantianhe, led by emancipation hero Cao Linshui, Farmers' Association Chairman Wang Chouhai, and Deputy Village Chief Guo Cunliu, among others, sent two groups to SuDian and Jiajiazhuang, respectively, consisting of mutual aid team leaders and production experts. SuDian was led by labor hero Bi Errong, and Jiajiazhuang was led by political director Niu Honghai. They visited each other, and on the afternoon of the 5th, they gathered in Nantianhe. A summary was held on the 6th, taking two and a half days to complete this pioneering initiative of the emancipated peasants.

　　II. Cao Linshui and Nantianhe
　　Upon arriving in Nantianhe, one saw a welcome message written on the public blackboard:
　　"Welcome visiting group,
　　Give us many suggestions,
　　Seek mutual progress,
　　Humbly share experiences."

　　The village was filled with an atmosphere of excitement.
　　SuDian's labor hero Bi Errong had seen Linshui's plan in the newspaper and knew that he wanted to hire long-term workers, buy livestock, reclaim wasteland, and grow cotton. As soon as he arrived in Nantianhe, he wanted to see if what he said was true. He walked with Cao Linshui, and as soon as they reached Jiazhang Road, they saw the production department under the pine trees and a melon patch next to the road, which was a small production initiative started by Chouhai's group (the same group as Linshui). Linshui pointed out his newly reclaimed four mu of wasteland. Bi Errong took a look: Good, the seedlings are growing evenly! Not far away were more than five mu of newly reclaimed wasteland right in front of him. Only then did Errong believe that what the newspaper said about Linshui reclaiming ten mu of wasteland was indeed true.
　　After crossing a ditch, they arrived at Linshui's cotton field. The cotton seedlings were very dense, with ten plants in a clump, said to have been planted by carrying water due to the drought, but they were growing lushly, almost the same as those planted during a suitable time. Errong couldn't help but admire him in his heart.
　　At noon, Linshui stepped forward, extended a warm hand, and grabbed Errong, saying, "Come on, let's go to my house for dinner." The two heroes walked shoulder to shoulder, and people cast admiring glances at them. During the meal, the two heroes discussed everything from mutual aid teams to large-scale work exchange, from the integration of agriculture and sideline occupations to the reorganization of village political finances. Linshui said, "Our group has opened a restaurant on Jiazhang Road and wants to earn tax money." Errong said, "Our village has reorganized village public property, registered the dilapidated temple and public trees, which amounted to over one million, and the expenses of the school and the public office are not a problem." A bowl of rice was eaten in ten minutes, with more than half a bowl left. These labor heroes were always thinking about the masses, how to get rich, and didn't even bother to eat properly!
　　During the meal, Errong glanced covertly: the hired worker was holding a bowl, eating; the newly bought black donkey was tied to the trough. Sure enough, the wasteland was well reclaimed, the cotton seedlings were all there, everything was real. If cotton is harvested this year, and white cloth is woven, it will be a terrific source of wealth!
　　After the meal, they met Yang Taoshao. Errong said to Linshui, "SuDian wants to come and dig some, to make medicine to kill cabbage worms, is that okay?" Linshui immediately agreed, "Farmers all over the world are one family, how can it not be okay! But be careful not to damage the bank." After Errong went back, he told everyone: No wonder everyone praises Cao Linshui, he deserves the praise. I must learn from Cao Linshui.
　　Errong's praise is passed over for now. Let's talk about Niu Honghai, the political director of Jiajiazhuang. As soon as he arrived in Nanbeitianhe, he first looked for the land of the military dependents. He saw that the military dependents' land was all marked with signs, done exceptionally well, and weeded exceptionally carefully. Honghai thought, let's see if it's all good, or just a few individual cases. That night, he specially knocked on the door to talk to a middle peasant family of a military dependent. Old man Wang Jingou told him, "My family of three is farming fifteen mu of land, and the village is farming ten mu for us. I only need to prepare fertilizer and seeds, and in the autumn I can get pure grain. I am sixty-two years old this year. I farm five mu of land myself, and even my daily life is taken care of by the group, and I get some wages." Honghai saw that the substitute farming was no problem, so he asked him if he had been given a share of the harvest. He said that he didn't get much the year before, but last year, after his son joined the army, he was given a cotton-padded robe and eight thousand yuan. It was just because of a spinning wheel issue. When I wanted to take it back, the cadres were going to say it was a redistribution, and I got angry at that time. But the cadres redistributed it to me at the mass meeting. It wouldn't be like this if I wasn't a military dependent!" After asking this family, still fearing it wasn't real, he found another middle peasant family of a military dependent, Guo Quanze, to talk to. He said almost the same thing as Jingou, and also said that he was given 10,000 yuan this spring, and the land was substitute-farmed a long time ago. Only then did Honghai believe that the preferential treatment of military dependents led by Linshui was really good.
　　Jia Changshui, the logistics director of SuDian, chatted with his relative Xu Shuanggen that night. Xu Shuanggen said: At the beginning, I was just afraid of struggle (because I was beaten up when digging air-raid shelters last winter, but I didn't suffer any economic losses). Now I just want to expand. There was not enough fertilizer on the five mu of corn, so I plan to buy some soybean cakes and apply another fifty jin per mu, which will cost one thousand yuan, but I can get two dan and five dou of grain. I also want to engage in transportation and open a production shop in partnership with the SuDian saltpeter workshop. Changshui then asked him why he had this idea of getting rich. Shuangyin explained: First, he heard the people at the Nandong meeting say that struggle fills the holes, and it won't touch the middle peasants, and whoever is given something can keep it. Second, he was given three mu of land and one thousand yuan this spring. He said: "If you struggle, you don't give land, if you give land, you're not afraid of struggle. If you keep struggling and finish off the middle peasants, who will want the fruits?" Therefore, his whole family, men farming and women spinning, all want to get rich.
　　Besides these points, the peasants in the visiting group unanimously praised the sanitation work of Nanbeitianhe: every household's outhouse was cleaned up, and the yards were swept clean. No wonder, at the summary, Zhang Deke, the old village chief of Jiajiazhuang, stretched out his thumb and said, "Linshui is truly a hero, not a single empty word, Nanbeitianhe is doing really well!"

　　But Nantianhe also has shortcomings. The visiting group found that intensive cultivation was not done well enough, and the accounts of the mutual aid teams were not settled in time.

　　III. In Jiajiazhuang and SuDian
　　The visiting group carefully looked around Jiajiazhuang, and everyone unanimously agreed that Jiajiazhuang's intensive cultivation was done very well. The land was plowed once and harrowed once, fluffy and loose, and not a single grain stubble could be found in the field. After the hail disaster, they quickly replanted, and the seedlings grew evenly and well.
　　Everyone also paid special attention to the integration of agriculture and sideline occupations. Twenty-seven animals transported coal for four days, earning 170,000 yuan; opening an oil mill for two months, each share received a profit-sharing trough cake. Two blacksmiths cut files and earned over 100,000 yuan in foreign currency in two months; when the flour mill heard about the tax, they sold three pigs and distributed the profits to the masses to solve their difficulties. However, the accounting of the mutual aid team was not timely, and the enthusiasm of women for spinning and weaving was high, but the cadres did not pay close attention to leadership, which was a shortcoming.
　　Upon arriving at SuDian, they first visited the mutual aid teams outside the East Gate. Among them, especially Bi Eryun's group, was working vigorously. His group had an old woman named Qiu Liu's wife, who got up early every day to wake people up and pick up manure along the way. After picking up manure and returning, if she called the second time and people still didn't get up, she would fine them four liang of rice, so there were no lazy people in the whole group. The land farmed for the military dependents was issued work tickets, and whoever did the work earned the money. Many military dependents were willing to do the work themselves, and only the major tasks were done by substitute farming. Desheng's family, a military dependent, said, "It was planted without even saying anything, this year is better than last year!" The visiting group also found that the masses in SuDian had the idea of "one mu of garden is worth ten mu of field" and "spinning is not as good as watering the garden," so there was a lot of grass and stubble in the autumn fields. In addition, middle peasants still had the fear of struggle. SuDian's small schools, one in each of the six streets, were very suitable for the situation of a large village, and everyone thought they were doing very well. The women of SuDian proposed to wear their own woven new clothes at the meeting on the fifth day of the seventh lunar month.

　　IV. After the Visit
　　After the visit, a summary meeting was held on the 6th. At the meeting, everyone talked about the advantages and disadvantages they had seen and heard, just like a family.
　　Cao Linshui said, "The people of SuDian often say 'one mu of garden is worth ten mu of field.' It is good to cultivate the garden well, but each family only has one or two mu, and they can't rely entirely on the garden. They still have to take care of both, because the garden can grow vegetables, but it can't grow rice." Bi Errong listened and agreed, then said, "Putting emphasis on the garden and neglecting the field is a short-sighted approach. This time I go back, no matter what the masses say or scold, I must solve this ideological problem for the masses." Niu Honghai said, "This time I came to visit Tianhe, heard the clatter of the machines in the factory, and saw that everyone was using their own woven cloth to sew new clothes. I am determined that this time I go back, I will help women to operate the machines, buy flowers, and spin and weave well." As soon as Linshui heard this, he immediately said, "You take care of the machines, and I will send people to help you operate them." Honghai said, "Your village wants to build an oil mill, and I will also be responsible." Linshui said, "Yes, in the future, if the cadres of our three villages create any experience, we will interact and help each other like relatives." Finally, Political Commissar Wang made a conclusion: "This visit is a new creation. Only revolutionary cadres can say such sincere words. We must further unite to lead the masses to emancipate themselves, and even more lead the masses to produce and get rich. After going back, we must always pay attention to implementing our thoughts. We must ensure the plan to cultivate two, surplus one. We must carry out intensive cultivation, apply more fertilizer, and launch a spinning and weaving movement. We will visit again after the summer harvest, and we will see who is better after the autumn harvest." The cadres of each village agreed with this opinion and dispersed with smiles.
　　After arriving home, the cadres of SuDian held a meeting of cadres and team leaders that night. They praised and introduced the intensive cultivation of Jiajiazhuang, the preferential treatment and substitute farming for military dependents in Tianhe, and the women's spinning and weaving. Bi Errong and Political Commissar Wang urged the women of SuDian to clean the streets the next day. Jiajiazhuang also held a meeting of cadres and activists that night. Wang Qianwu said, "I guarantee to operate a machine for five days." Honghai said, "I guarantee not to sell a single grain and use sideline production funds to pay off the taxes within five days." The masses were very moved when they heard this, so they made their own plans, and the groups challenged each other, making it very lively. The cadres of Tianhe also held a meeting of mutual aid team leaders that night to seize the time to settle the accounts and further rectify the mutual aid teams. Driven by this visit, the cadres of the three villages were vying to make contributions and were very enthusiastic, eager to "see who is better after the autumn harvest."

　　一幅翻身农民的耕织图，一种生产检查的新创造：
    三村生产参观团纪行
    一山、汉清、林堂、二只、学文、岷山集体报导
    一、是这样组织起来的
    长治二区四月十八日在南董开过一个春耕动员会。苏店、焦家庄同南天河挑战，要达到耕二余一。当时就规定下分春耕下种，锄苗夏收和秋收秋耕，检查三次。下种过后，因为焦家庄遭冰雹打了，没有按时检查。苏店，天河的群众便反映说：“哄人哩，说了就算啦，不检查了。”三村的干部一听，觉得不能叫群众失望，就想出了一个办法，组织三村参观团，互相参观，来检查工作。
    六月二日在区上研究了一番，大家都懂得了参观是为的推动工作、帮助落后、交流经验、密切三村翻身农民的关系。也商量定了参观的项目主要是看精耕细作（特别是对抗属地）、农副业结合和组织领导、搞得好不好。于是三个村提出了二十多个人来，就把参观团组织好了。
    六月四日下午南天河一方面由翻身英雄曹林水，农会主席王臭孩，村副郭存刘等，率领着互助组长和生产能手等，分两个组到苏店、焦家庄去。苏店由劳动英雄毕二荣，焦家庄由政治主任牛红孩率领，互相参观，到五日午，齐集南天河，六日进行总结，共用了两天半时间，完成了这一翻身农民的创举。
    二、曹林水和南天河
    一到南天河，只见大众黑板上写着一首欢迎词：
    “欢迎参观团，
    多给提意见，
    互相求进步，
    虚心谈经验”。
    村里洋溢着紧张欢快的空气。
    苏店劳动英雄毕二荣，看见过林水在报上的计划，知道他要雇长工、买牲口、开荒地、种棉花。一到南天河就想看看倒底他说的是真是假。他和曹林水走在一起，一到贾掌道上，就看见松树底下生产部，大道旁边香瓜园，是臭孩组（与林水同组）才搞起的小生产。林水指点出他新开的四亩荒地，毕二荣一看：好，苗儿长的匀煞煞的！再走不远，又是五亩多新开的荒地，摆在眼前。到此二荣才信了，报上所说林水开荒十亩，果然话非虚传。
    翻过一道沟，来到林水的棉花地，棉苗很稠，一堆就有十棵，据说是天旱担水点种的，可是长得茂堂堂的，就和趁晌种的差不多。二荣看了，不禁心中暗自佩服。
    天到中午，林水上前伸出亲热的手，一把拉住二荣说：“走，到咱家去吃饭”。两个英雄肩并肩的走着，人们都投以羡慕的眼光。两英雄在用饭时间，还是从互助组谈到大变工，从农副业结合谈到整理村政财。林水说：“我们组里在贾掌路上开了饭铺，想赚税契钱。”二荣说：“我村整理了一下村公产，把破庙公树登记起来，就有一百来万，学校和公所的花费就不愁了”。一碗饭吃了十分钟，还留着多半碗，这些劳动英雄，时刻在为群众打算着，怎样发财，连饭都顾不上好好吃了！
    吃饭时，二荣偷眼一看：雇工托着碗，在吃饭；新买黑驴槽头拴着，果然是荒地开好，棉花苗全，样样实在。真要今年收了棉花，织开白布，可是了不得的大富根！
    饭罢出来，碰见了杨桃稍，二荣就向林水说：“苏店想来刨点，制杀白菜虫药，行不行？”林水马上答应：“天下农民是一家，怎不行！不过要注意不要刨坏岸。”二荣回去后，见人就说：不怨别人赞成曹林水，就该赞成。我要好好向曹林水学习。
    二荣的赞叹，表过不提，再说焦家庄的政治主任牛红孩，他一到南北天河就先找军属地。只见军属地里都插着牌，做的分外好，锄得分外仔细。红孩看了，心想：再看看到底是都好，还是只是个别好。那天夜里就专门敲开门去找了个中农抗属谈话。王金狗老汉对他说：“我一家三口人种着十五亩地，村上给代耕十亩。我只把肥料种籽准备好，秋天就可净得粮食。我今年六十二岁，自己种着五亩地，重生活也是组里给做，出些工资。”红孩看代耕没问题，就问他分果实了没有。他说前年没分啥，去年孩子参军后，给我分了棉袍一领，钱八千元，就是因为一个纺车问题，我拿回想要，干部又要说重分，当时就想起孩子发了次脾气。可是干部又在群众大会上分给我了，不是抗属那能这样！”这家问了还怕不实在，又找了一个中农抗属郭全则去谈：他说的和金狗差不多，而且说今春还给分了一万元钱，地也早代耕好了。红孩到此才信，林水领导的优抗工作真好。
    苏店的后勤主任贾长水，当天夜里到亲戚许双根家闲拉。许双根说：开场时我光怕斗争，（因为去冬挖防空洞时，曾打了他一顿，但经济上未受损失。）现在我光想扩大。五亩玉茭上粪少了，计划买些豆饼，每亩再上五十斤，花个一千元，可多打二石五斗粮。还想搞运输，和苏店硝坊合伙开个生产铺。长水就追问他为啥有了这个发财思想。双银说明：一来是听到南董会的人们说，斗争填窟窿，不会动到中农，分给谁的收了算谁的；二来是今春又给他分了三亩地，一千元钱。他说：“既斗争就不分地，既分地就不怕斗争，如果一直斗下去，把中农斗完，果实叫谁要？”因此他全家男种地，女纺花，都一心想发财。
    除下这几点外，参观团的农民们，一致称赞南北天河的卫生工作也作得好：家家的茅子收拾得清洁，院子也都打扫得干干净净的。怪不得在总结时焦家庄的旧村长张德科伸着大姆指说：“林水果真英雄，没有一句空话，南北天河做得真好”？
    可是南天河也有缺点，参观团发现精耕细作搞的不够好，互助组的帐也没有及早算清。
    三、在焦家庄和苏店
    参观团在焦家庄前后仔细看了看，大家一致认为焦家庄的精耕细作，做的顶好。地全犁过一遍，耙过一遍，虚突突的，满地里连一个谷茬也找不见。经过雹灾后又赶快补种上，小苗长得又齐又好。
    大家又特别注意到农副业的结合。二十七头牲口转班运炭四天，赚了十七万元，开油坊两个月，每股分红一槽饼。两个铁匠剁锉，两月赚洋十几万元；粉坊听说要税契就卖了三口猪，给群众分红，解决困难。不过互助组算帐不及时，妇女纺织劲头大，干部没抓紧领导是个缺点。
    到苏店首先访问东门外的互助组。其中特别是毕二云组，干的有劲。他组有一个秋刘老婆，天天早早起来叫人，捎带拾粪，拾粪回来，再叫第二遍还不起床的，规定出四两米，所以全组没一个懒汉。给抗属代耕地，发有工票，谁做活谁赚，有许多抗属就愿意自己做活，不得已的大生活才用人代耕。抗属德胜家说：“不用说就给种上了，今年可比去年好！”参观团也发现苏店群众有着“一亩园十亩田”，“纺花不如浇园”的重园轻田思想，所以秋地很多是草多茬在。另外，中农仍存有怕斗争思想。苏店的小型学校，六个街，一个街一个，很合大村情况，大家都认为办的很好。苏店妇女们提出在七月初五会上穿自己纺织的新衣裳。
    四、参观以后
    参观以后，六日开了个总结会，会上大家都把眼见耳闻的优缺点，象一家人一样说出来。
    曹林水说：“苏店人常说‘一亩园十亩田’，好好种园，固然对，可是每家只一二亩，不能全靠园，还得两头照顾。因为园地长起菜，长不起米来”。毕二荣听了很赞同，接着说：“重园轻田，这是烧了眉毛只顾眼前的办法。我这次回去，不管群众怎说怎骂，一定要给群众解决这个思想问题。”牛红孩说：“这次来参观天河，听工厂机声哗啦哗啦，见谁家也在用自己织的布缝新衣裳。我是下决心了，这次回去非帮助妇女打机、买花，好好纺织起来不行。”林水一听马上就说：“你管打机，我管派人给你上机。”红孩说：“你村要安油坊，我也负责。”林水说：“对，今后咱三村的干部创造出什么经验来，就和亲戚一样的互相来往，互相帮助。”最后由王政委作了结论：“这次参观是个新创造，不是革命干部，也说不出这种真心话。我们要进一步团结起来领导群众翻身，更要领导群众生产发财，回去以后，要时刻注意贯串思想。定耕三余计划，精耕细作，上追粪，开展纺织运动，夏收后再参观一次，秋后见高低。”各村干部同意了这个意见，就笑盈盈的散了。
    到家之后，苏店干部在当天夜里就开了干部组长会议。把焦家庄的精耕细作，天河的优抗代耕、妇女纺织，称赞介绍了一番，毕二荣、王政委在第二天沿街督促苏店妇女们打扫街道。焦家庄也在当天夜里开了个干部积极分子会。王谦五说：“我保证五天打一架机”。红孩说：“我保证不卖一颗粮，用副业生产款，五天税完契。群众听了都很感动，于是自己定计划，组和组挑战，闹得很活跃。天河干部在当天夜里也召开互助组长会议，抓紧算帐清帐，进一步整顿互助组。经过这次参观的推动，三村干部都争先立功，劲头很大，摩拳擦掌，准备“秋后见高低”。
