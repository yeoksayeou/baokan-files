　　Sisters' Revenge
    Gu Weijin
    Wang Yuying’s family home was in ×× Village in the Second District Guerrilla Zone of Jiyuan, consisting of her father, mother, and older brother. Last winter, when the enemy occupied Jiyuan, Yuying’s father and brother were buried alive by the counter-reckoning team from Nanling. Her mother was so enraged that she hanged herself. Before her death, her mother grabbed Yuying's hand and said, "The Wang family is finished. Your younger sister, Cuiying's husband, has become a member of the counter-reckoning team. Your revenge depends on you!"
    Yuying never forgot her mother's words, thinking every day about how to avenge her parents. Later, she became the secretary of the village women's rescue association (something many people in the guerrilla zone dared not do at the time), and she also mobilized her husband to join the militia. She worked hard, waiting for the opportunity to take revenge.
    This spring, land reform was carried out along the Mang River. The masses were afraid that the counter-reckoning team from Nanling would make a comeback, so they dared not ask for land. The local militia and guerrilla team then marched to Nanling to strike down the counter-reckoning team.
    Nanling is an earthen ridge on the border of Ji (yuan) and Meng (xian), with complex terrain. The counter-reckoning team lived in those mountain villages and dugouts, and they moved their residence every night. The front was also sheltered by the regular enemy army stronghold in Longtai (under the jurisdiction of Meng County). Therefore, guerrilla activities were very difficult, and many reconnaissance missions were sent out, but none were able to grasp the pattern of the counter-reckoning team's movements.
    When Wang Yuying heard that the guerrilla team was coming to Nanling to strike down the counter-reckoning team, she was very happy. She told her husband, "The opportunity for revenge has come." Her husband said, "Yes, but they are still having difficulties, unable to ascertain the intelligence." Yuying said, "That's easy. My younger sister, Cuiying, lives there. I'll ask her to help." Her husband said, "Easier said than done. Her husband is a member of the counter-reckoning team. Isn't she also of the same mind?" Yuying said, "That's not necessarily true. Doesn't she want to avenge her parents?" So Yuying secretly sent a letter to Cuiying, asking her to come over.
    Cuiying is thirty years old, five years younger than her older sister. Since marrying Li ××, a member of the counter-reckoning team, she has rarely had contact with her sister. Only last year did her sister write her a letter, telling her that her father and brother were killed by her husband's gang of counter-reckoners. At that time, Cuiying was very sad. Sometimes, thinking that there were no relatives in her family home, she couldn't help but feel sad and thought about visiting her sister's family. However, her husband did not allow it, because he was afraid that she would leak information, or even be infected with "the Eighth Route Army's thinking." Today, she received a letter from her sister. It just so happened that her husband was not at home, so she immediately set off down the mountain.
    When the sisters met, they talked about the murder of their parents, and their eyes turned red. They cried bitterly. Yuying said, "We must avenge our parents!" Cuiying nodded. Yuying continued, "There is no one left in our Wang family. Our revenge depends on us sisters." Cuiying said, "What can we women do?!" Yuying said, "If we want to do it, there is a way!" She then told her about the guerrilla team coming to Nanling to strike down the counter-reckoning team, and about her request for help with intelligence. Cuiying immediately worried and said, "That won't do. If we don't succeed and my husband finds out that I did this, it would be terrible!" Yuying said, "We are sure to succeed. Don't you see the Eighth Route Army? They took Jiyuan city when they wanted to, and they took Zhongwang Village when they wanted to. It won't be a problem to deal with this gang of counter-reckoners." Cuiying was dubious, and suddenly another concern came: "Even if we succeed, will he (referring to her husband) survive?..." Saying this, she shed tears sadly. Yuying explained to her, "Don't worry. He is a secondary element. Besides, you will have contributed to helping with the intelligence. Your merits will outweigh your crimes, and he will certainly be treated leniently." However, because Cuiying had lived in the enemy's camp for a long time, it was difficult for her to believe this immediately. Yuying was eager for revenge and became more and more excited as she spoke: "Sister, don't you think about how our father and our brother died? They forced them to dig the pit, pushed them down, they reached out their arms to get out, and they chopped down with iron shovels, cutting off two arms... What a great injustice! Sister, we have finally gotten this opportunity for revenge. If you don't do it, I won't recognize you as my sister. Don't ever come to my house to visit relatives again." These words, like needles, pierced Cuiying's heart. Cuiying wept. At this time, Yuying gave her current affairs education again. She repeatedly explained the Eighth Route Army's lenient policy. Cuiying gradually understood and ignited the flame of revenge. Finally, she grabbed Yuying's hand and said firmly: "Okay, if we can succeed, let's do it!"
    At that moment, the sisters discussed how to send intelligence to the guerrilla team. Under the enemy's heavy blockade, it was difficult to send intelligence to the guerrilla team. The sisters put a lot of effort into it, and agreed on a method of using code instead of intelligence when the guerrilla team attacked: (1) If three tiles are placed on the roof of Cuiying's home—Qugou Mountain Village—it means that Qugou, Jinliuzhuang, and Yuangou all have people and guns; (2) Two tiles and one brick means that Yuangou and Jinliuzhuang have people and guns, and Qugou has people but no guns; (3) One tile means that Qugou has people and guns, and Yuangou and Jinliuzhuang have no people and no guns. At the same time, they also discussed everything that Cuiying must do when the guerrilla team attacks.
    The guerrilla team was distressed for several days because they could not get clear intelligence. Suddenly, they were happy to hear Yuying say that her sister could help with this matter. On the third night, the guerrilla team quietly bypassed the Longtai enemy stronghold and advanced towards the heart of the enemy.
    In a series of overlapping earthen ridges two or three miles behind Longtai, there was a mountain gully with cave dwellings, shining with bright lights. Under the light, mahjong tiles were being played lively. A well-proportioned woman was being called by the mahjong players to make tea. That was Cuiying. This gambling game was successfully pulled off by Cuiying. When Cuiying saw her husband singing songs idly in the morning, she said:
    "Why not play mahjong to make it lively?"
    "Right, I would have forgotten if you hadn't said that."
    Cuiying then went out to invite a group of counter-reckoners. When the number was enough, there were two tables.
    Now Cuiying was busy making tea for them, while anxiously awaiting one thing: she had been entangled by them for a long time and had not had a chance to put the agreed-upon code on the roof. Suddenly, Cuiying had an idea: she deliberately dropped a teapot. Her husband, who had lost money, scolded her, and she retorted. Her husband slapped her twice, and she cried and made a scene, while taking the opportunity to run to the roof to arrange the code. Then she quietly came down from the roof.
    The guerrilla team climbed to the roof and found the two tiles and one brick placed by Cuiying, and immediately understood that there were people without guns below, and people with guns in Yuangou and Jinliuzhuang. The strong guerrilla team went to take care of Yuangou and Jinliuzhuang, and the remaining people sneaked down from the roof.
    A series of urgent knocks on the door frightened the counter-reckoning team in the room into a panic.
    "Who is it?"
    "Your father!"
    "Who exactly is it?"
    "Your Eighth Route Army grandfather!"
    The counter-reckoning team members scurried to the cellar and under the bed.
    "Open it or not, your grandfather will throw a grenade in and blow you all to death."
    "Oh, Chief, there's nothing in our house!..." Cuiying pretended to cry and plead, while coming out to open the door. The guerrilla team went in and tied up eight counter-reckoning team members. Including those arrested in Yuangou and Jinliuzhuang, a total of twenty-four people, including the counter-reckoning team leader Yan Fuwang, were tied up.
    This news shook both sides of the Mang River. Many villages then ended the meeting of "opening up key ideological areas." People excitedly said: "Now that we have destroyed the tiger's den, there is no need to open up any ideology. We can simply move the things that exploited us from the landlords' homes!" Thus, the land reform movement spread like wildfire.

　　姊妹复仇
    古维进
    王玉英的娘家在济源二区游击区××村，有父、母、哥三人。去冬敌占济源，玉英的父亲和哥哥被南岭的倒算队活埋，母亲气得上了吊。母亲临死时抓住玉英的手说：“王家的人死完了，你妹子翠英的男人又成了个倒算队，要报仇就靠你了！”
    玉英永远记住母亲的话，每天想着怎样代父母报仇，后来当了村妇救会秘书（当时在这个游击区许多人都不敢干的），又动员丈夫参加民兵。他努力工作着，等待报仇的机会。
    今春蟒河沿岸进行土地改革，群众害怕南岭的倒算队卷土重来，都不敢要地，当地的民兵游击队便开到南岭打倒算队。
    南岭是济（源）孟（县）交界的一条土岭，地形复杂，倒算队住在那些山庄窝铺里，每晚还转移住地，前头又有龙台（孟县属）敌人正规军据点掩护，因此游击队活动非常困难，曾派出许多侦察，都没有摸住倒算队转移的规律。
    王玉英听到游击队开过来，要到南岭打倒算队，非常高兴，告丈夫说：“报仇的机会来了。”丈夫说：“是呵，就是人家还有困难，探不清情报。”玉英说：“这个容易，我妹子翠英住在那边，叫她帮个忙。”丈夫说：“说得容易，她丈夫是倒算队，她还不是倒算队的脑筋。”玉英说：“这倒不一定，难道父母之仇，她都不报？”于是玉英秘密给翠英捎去一封信，叫她来一趟。
    翠英今年三十岁，比姊姊小五岁，自从嫁给倒算队李××，很少和姊姊来往，只是去年姊姊给她写过一封信，告说父亲和哥哥就是他丈夫这一伙倒算队害的。当时翠英很伤心，有时想起娘家没有一个亲人，心里不免难过，便想到姊姊家里看看，但是，丈夫是不允许的，因为害怕她走漏消息，甚至怕她染上“八路军的思想”。今天她接到姊姊的来信，恰好丈夫不在家，便即动身下山。
    姊妹见面，谈到父母被害，大家眼眶一红，痛哭了一场，玉英说：“父母之仇，一定要报！”翠英点头。玉英又说：“咱王家没有人了，要报仇就靠咱姊妹俩。”翠英说：“咱们女人还能顶什么事？！”玉英说：“要干就有办法！”随即把游击队要到南岭打倒算队，以及要求她帮忙搞情报的情形说了一遍，翠英立刻发愁的说：“这个使不得，你想，如果闹不住他们，丈夫知道我干这个事情，那还了得！”玉英说：“保险闹住了，你不看八路军，要打济源城就拿下来了，要打中王村也拿下来了，要说对付这般倒算队，就不成问题。”翠英半信半疑，突然另一个顾虑又来了：“就算是把他们闹住吧，他（指丈夫）还活得成？……”说到这里，凄然泪下，玉英给他解释说：“不必操心呀，他是次要分子，再说，你帮助探好情报，有你一份功劳，将功折罪，保险能宽大他了。”但是，由于翠英长期住在敌人那里，马上很难相信这话。玉英复仇心切，越说越激动了：“妹子，你就不想咱父亲和咱哥怎样死的？人家迫他们刨好坑，把他们推下去，他们探出胳膊想出来，人家铁锹劈下去，斩断两条胳膊……这个冤气多么大！妹子，咱好容易得到这个报仇的机会，你要不干，我就不认你是我的亲妹子，往后你就再不要来我家走亲戚了。”这话，针一样的刺住翠英的心，翠英呜呜地哭。这时玉英又给她进行时事教育。反复说明八路军的宽大政策，翠英渐渐打通思想，燃起复仇的火焰，终于抓住玉英的手坚决地说：“好，要能闹住他们，咱就干吧！”
    当下，姊妹研究如何给游击队送情报。在敌人重重封锁下，要给游击队送情报是困难的，姊妹费了一番心血，约好游击队进攻的时候，用暗号代替情报的办法：（一）在翠英的家——曲沟山庄的窑顶上，摆三个瓦，就是曲沟，金留庄，元沟都有人有枪；（二）摆两个瓦一个砖，就是元沟，金留庄有人有枪，曲沟有人没有枪；（三）摆一个瓦，就是曲沟有人有枪，元沟，金留庄没人没枪，同时又商量好当游击队进攻的时候，翠英必须进行的一切事情。
    游击队搞不清情报苦恼了几天，忽然听玉英说到妹子可以帮助这件事情，实在高兴，第三天夜里，游击队便悄悄绕过龙台敌人据点，向着敌人心脏地带突进。
    在龙台后头二三里地的一片重重叠叠的土岭里，有一条山沟的窑洞，射出明亮的灯光，灯光下，马将牌正打得热闹，一个姿态匀的女人，被打牌的人呼唤着泡茶，那就是翠英。这一场赌博是翠英拉拢成功的。当上午翠英看见丈夫闲着唱曲子，便说：
    “为啥不打牌热闹热闹呢？”
    “对，你不说我就要忘记了。”
    翠英随即出去邀来一批倒算队，一凑人数，正好两场。
    现在翠英一边忙着给他们泡茶，一边焦急一件事情：她被他们缠了半天，还没有机会到窑顶把规定的暗号布置起来。忽然翠英心生一计：故意打掉一个茶壶。输了钱的丈夫把她骂一顿，她就顶嘴，丈夫打了她两个耳光，她便哭着闹着，一边便趁机跑到窑顶布置了暗号。于是就悄悄地从窑顶下来了。
    游击队爬到窑顶，找见了翠英摆的两个瓦一个砖，马上明白下面有人没有枪，元沟、金留庄有人有枪。战斗力强的游击队都去收拾元沟和金留庄，剩下的人就从窑顶摸下来。
    一阵急急的拍门声，把屋里的倒算队吓的乱作一团。
    “谁？”
    “你的老子！”
    “到底是谁？”
    “你的八路爷爷！”
    倒算队吓的往地窖、床底里窜。
    “开不开，老子的手榴弹扔进去，把你们通炸死。”
    “哎唷，老总，咱家啥没啥！……”翠英一边假装哭求着，一边出来开门。游击队进去一共捆了八个倒算队，连同元沟、金留庄逮捕的计算起来，共捆了倒算队长阎福旺以下二十四个人。
    这个消息，轰到蟒河两岸，许多村庄随即结束“打通要地思想”的会议，人们兴奋的说：“现在剿了虎窝，用不着再打通什么思想，干脆到地主家里搬回剥削咱们的东西！”于是土地改革运动，就如火燎原般的开展了。
