　　Chiang Kai-shek Government
  　Conceals Economic Crisis
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th—Since the soaring prices in Shanghai started in late June, the Chiang government has adopted an ostrich-like approach to conceal the economic crisis, prohibiting newspapers and news agencies from publishing any news about the black market. According to a Shanghai dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 2nd, the Shanghai Municipal Government has explicitly ordered newspapers to be prohibited from publishing black market news about gold, banknotes, and foreign exchange. The Telecommunications Bureau has also been ordered to refuse to accept or send telegrams related to the black market. Once discovered, they will be "handled by the court according to law." In addition, the Shanghai Chiang's police bureau announced the strengthening of so-called "economic police," namely economic secret service work, to attack private commerce and finance, in order to facilitate the further monopoly of the four major families.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st—According to the Tianjin Dagongbao and the Central News Agency, smuggling is rampant in various parts of South China and Taiwan. At various ports in Guangdong Province, Chiang's military officers openly transport goods under armed escort. In Taiwan, the number of ships seized for smuggling since January of this year has reached seventeen. Last year, the amount seized in Taipei was over 10 million Taiwan dollars, equivalent to nearly 400 million Chiang currency; in Tainan Customs, it was over 5.5 million Taiwan dollars, equivalent to nearly 200 million Chiang currency.

　　蒋介石政府
  　掩饰经济危机
    【新华社陕北四日电】自上月下旬沪市物价开始狂涨后，蒋政府对经济危机已采取鸵鸟式之掩饰办法，禁止报纸及通讯社发表有关黑市的任何消息。据中央社二日沪电称：上海市政府已明令禁止报纸刊载金、钞、外汇等黑市消息：电讯局亦奉令拒绝收发有关黑市之电报，一经查出，即“依法送法院办理”。此外上海蒋记警察局并宣布加强所谓“经济警察”，即经济特务工作，向民间商业及金融业开刀，以便于四大家族进一步垄断。
    【新华社陕北一日电】据津大公报及中央社透露：华南各地及台湾走私炽。广东省各口岸多由蒋记军官武装公开包运。台湾之走私仅今年一月以来缉获之船只即达十七艘。去年台北缉获者达台币一千余万，合蒋币近四亿元；台南关为台币五百余万，合蒋币近二亿元。
