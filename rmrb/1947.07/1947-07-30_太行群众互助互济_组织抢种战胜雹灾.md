　　Taihang Masses Help Each Other
　　Organize Crash Planting to Overcome Hail Disaster
　　[Report from this newspaper] Comprehensive reports from various parts of Taihang: After the hailstorms in fourteen counties including Anyang, Huguan, Zuoquan, Xingtai, Shahe, Ping顺 (Ping Shun), Yushe, Changzhi, and Xiyang on the 13th and 14th of this month, cadres and masses in various places immediately displayed a high degree of class friendship, and set off a wave of mutual aid and self-help, immediately forming a disaster relief and crash planting movement. Anyang County organized a condolence group, carrying 2.3 million yuan in goods and money, and 2,500 kilograms of rice saved by various agencies, and went to the disaster area on the same day to relieve the disaster victims. Comrade Gao Baozhong of the Fifth District Branch did not sleep all night on the 14th due to the hailstorm, and the next morning he ran to twelve villages to express condolences and guide the masses to seize the time for crash planting. Comrade Hu Liansheng, the secretary of the Third District, wrote letters to various villages overnight while suffering from malaria to encourage the masses to replant. Yang Zhaohai, the head of the Fourth District, personally pulled a seed drill for an old lady in Yangjiadong to plant the land. He Deyou, the head of the Sixth District, led male and female cadres to water more than 30 mu of land overnight in Qiang Village. Beiliusi, Nanduan Village, and Dongxichaiku lent 4.5 dan of grain seeds to Zhangdeng and Yongding villages, which were severely affected by the disaster, and automatically took 36 animals to help the two villages crash plant more than 300 mu in two days. They said: "Farmers all over the world are one family. If you can't plant your land and have nothing to eat, how can we feel at ease? It is our duty to help!" Changzhi County agencies loaned 150,000 yuan, and immediately sent nine cadres to buy back 2,486 kilograms of millet, 109 kilograms of buckwheat seeds, and 253 kilograms of various vegetable seeds in one day, and immediately distributed them to the disaster area for emergency replanting. The masses in Sudian, the Second District, said: "Hitting them is the same as hitting us!" They immediately collected a large cart of seeds and sent them to Xiaohuazhuang in the First District. Women in Guancun proposed to strengthen spinning to make up for the hail disaster, and planned to spin 500 kilograms of cotton in 20 days. The Third District of Xiyang launched a campaign to plant autumn vegetables and buckwheat, requiring each person to plant four fen of radishes and two fen of vegetables, and to plant buckwheat on all ripe wasteland. At present, 216 mu of radishes and 108 mu of vegetables have been planted. It is expected that the yield of one mu of vegetables can顶(top) three mu of autumn field grain. Yushe has crash planted more than 1,500 mu of "grain to be returned to the granary in sixty days" and autumn black beans. Yuan Shulin, the model village head of Yuanzhuang in Zuoquan, led the masses to support 256 mu of seedlings and sow 164 mu of autumn vegetables in two days. The masses in Huguan proposed "save lives and relieve disasters", and the wages were reduced to four jin, and no wages were paid for the childless and widowed without labor, which solved the difficulty that high wages could not be planted.
