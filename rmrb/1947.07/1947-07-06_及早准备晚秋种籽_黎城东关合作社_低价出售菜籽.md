　　Preparing Late Autumn Seeds Early
  　Licheng Dongguan Cooperative
  　Sells Vegetable Seeds at Low Prices
    [This newspaper Licheng News] The Dongguan Cooperative is assisting the masses in combating drought and weathering famine, seizing the time to plant autumn crops. To specifically resolve the difficulties the masses face in replanting, it has purchased 130 catties of vegetable seeds and decided to sell them to the masses at low prices. White radishes are 60 yuan per liang (market price 80 yuan), red radishes are 35 yuan per liang (market price 50 yuan), and mustard seeds are 100 yuan per liang (market price 130 yuan). Sales have already begun, and the masses are scrambling to buy them. (Xiao Hao, Li Heng, Shi De)
    [This newspaper news] Taihang first-class cooperative hero Li Shenkui, in order to respond to the Party's call to implement the movement to combat drought and weather famine, and based on the demands of the masses, has adopted the spirit of "everyone takes care of everyone's affairs, collective leadership with individual responsibility," and is rectifying the Beiliu Cooperative. Li Shenkui (the cooperative's director) is taking care of the overall situation while also organizing a branch in Henan Dian, mainly to help the masses organize transportation, transporting people with their rations to cook their own meals, so as to avoid spending too much money on lodging. The deputy director is in charge of the credit department and is also helping the textile accountant to be responsible for the retail department, helping to promote textile products. Other dyeing workshops, medical departments, etc., are operating independently under collective leadership. This overcomes individual disorganization and also brings out everyone's talents, making it easier to organize the masses to produce and overcome famine. At the same time, the cooperative is also practicing frugality in its expenditures. Five villagers mainly work for the cooperative, integrating their family life, and return home to eat based on the amount of work done, such as doing work for the cooperative, paying two jin of rice for cooking per day. The remaining five people (villagers from outside and doctors), minus the cook, take turns cooking meals, changing from two parts rice to one part flour to four parts rice to one part flour, with salt, vegetables, and charcoal used in half amounts. After making these savings, they calculated that they can save 417 jin of millet per month. (Licheng Drought Resistance and Famine Preparation Small Newspaper)

　　及早准备晚秋种籽
  　黎城东关合作社
  　低价出售菜籽
    【本报黎城讯】东关合作社协助群众抗旱渡荒，抢种秋采，具体解决群众补种困难，买了菜籽一百三十斤，并决定以低价售给群众。白萝卜每两六十元（市价八十元），红萝卜每两三十五元（市价五十元），芥菜籽每两一百元（市价一百三十元），现已开始出售，群众纷纷争购。（小好、李恒、士德）
    【本报讯】太行一等合作英雄李申奎为了响应党贯彻抗旱渡荒运动号召，根据群众要求，采取大家事大家办，集体领导分工负责的精神，对北流合作社加以整顿。李申奎（社长）一面照顾全面，一面到河南店组织一个分社，主要帮助群众组织运输，运输人带口粮起火，免得住店花钱过大。副社长掌握信用部，并帮助纺织会计负责门市部，帮助推销纺织成品，其它染坊、医药部等在集体领导下让其单独经营，这样克服了个人忙乱，也发挥了各人天才，便于更好组织群众生产渡荒。同时社内在开支上也作到了省吃俭用，五个本村人以社为主，结合家庭生活，按活计工回家吃饭，如给社内作活，每日发二斤火食米，其余五个人（外村人与医生）减去伙夫，轮流作饭，由两米一面改为四米一面，盐、菜、炭减用一半。这样节约后，他们计算了一下，每月可节省小米四百一十七斤。（黎城抗旱备荒小报）
