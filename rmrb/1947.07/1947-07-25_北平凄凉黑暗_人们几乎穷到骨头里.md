Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. The Tianjin Dagongbao published an article on June 29th revealing that under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, Beiping, known as an ancient cultural capital with abundant cultural relics, has been completely changed. The article stated: Beiping is now not only difficult to maintain, but it is almost collapsing, and the people living there are almost poor to the bone. The rickshaws gathered and swaying are mostly unable to find passengers. Many factories are losing money and suspending production, but they are reluctant to close. The world-famous Beiping handicraft workers have mostly changed their profession to rickshaw pullers. Shops are generally deserted. Besides firewood, rice, oil, and salt, who is in the mood to care about anything else? The grand silk shops in Dashilar Market, with their magnificent facades, rarely see customers. As a last resort, they order the shop assistants to set up stalls on the roadside. The most lively Dong'an Market has stalls that rarely open for business all day long. Despite the sparkling jewelry and dazzling array of goods in Langfang Toutiao and Ertiao, the jewelry stores struggle to sell enough to buy two corn buns. The Liulichang Street, where intellectuals lingered, is now quiet and sparsely populated. Antique and painting shops rarely see customers all day long. One shop owner said, "Our industry is starving! The price of rice and flour is rising, while the price of paintings and antiques is falling, but there is still no business." The intellectuals said, "We haven't been to Liulichang for a long time. We rely on selling books to make a living. Where do we have extra money to buy paintings? We really dare not go there. When we step into the shop, the shopkeepers are frightened, thinking that this poor scholar has come to sell books again."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. According to the Tianjin Minguo Daily: Due to the corruption of Chiang Kai-shek's official management, the power outages in Beiping have been unprecedentedly serious since the end of last month. Three-quarters of the city's people have suffered from the darkness. All employees of the Jibei Electric Power Company have filed a complaint against Bao Guobao, the general manager of the company, and Yu Changju, the manager of the Beiping branch, for embezzling and engaging in malfeasance: appointing cronies, excluding dissidents, colluding with merchants by establishing a supply committee, and engaging in open corruption. All expenses of Bao and Yu's residences are paid by the company from public accounts, and the general affairs office forges seals to embezzle funds. As a result, in less than eight months of Bao and Yu's tenure, two generators have been destroyed, and the power generation capacity has been reduced from 30,000 to 12,000 kilowatts.

　　北平凄凉黑暗
  　“人们几乎穷到骨头里”
    【新华社陕北廿三日电】津大公报六月二十九日载文披露，在蒋介石统治之下，向称文化古都文物秀盛的北平，现已面目全非。该文称：北平现在非但维持不易，简直看着要垮，活在那里的人们几乎穷到骨头里。丛集着幌荡着的三轮车，多数是揽不到乘客的。多少工厂赔本停摆，还舍不得关闭。驰名世界的北平小手工艺者，多已改业为三轮车夫，商店一概萧条，除了柴米油盐之外，谁还有心情顾到别的？大栅栏市上的大绸缎庄，门面堂皇，经常难见顾客。不得已，却令店员到马路边上去摆地摊。最热闹的东安市场，有整天难得开张的摊子。廊房头条二条，尽管珠光宝气，琳琅满目，一家家的珠宝店难卖进两顿窝窝头的钱。读书人流连忘返的琉璃厂大街，现在路静人稀，书画古玩店终日少见顾客。一家店主人说：“我们这行可挨了饿了！米面越涨价，书画古玩越落价，但还是没有生意。”而读书人则说：“我们久已不到琉璃厂了。我们自己靠要卖书度日，那里还有余钱买书画？我们也实在不敢去逛，迈进店门，店里人先吓一跳，以为这穷酸又来卖书了。”
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】据天津民国日报讯：由于蒋记官家经营之腐败，上月下旬起，平市停电空前严重，全市已有四分之三区域人民饱尝黑暗痛苦。冀北电力公司全体职工刻提出检举该公司总经理鲍国宝及北平分公司经理余昌菊贪污舞弊之罪状为：任用私人，排除异己，巧立供应委员会与商人勾结，公开舞弊，鲍、余公馆一切用费均由公司出公帐，总务处伪制图章大吃空额等。以致鲍、余任职不及八个月，已毁发电机两架，发电能力由三万锐减至一万二千基罗瓦特。
