　　Great Merits in the Counter-Offensive!
  　Soldiers Rejoice and Resolve to Show Their Skills
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Amidst the sound of the great counter-offensive, the soldiers of our People's Liberation Army are all elated, sharpening their knives and polishing their guns, preparing to show their skills in this great action and make immortal contributions to the people:
    ◇ New Soldier Liu Laifa said: "I'll wait until the victory of the counter-offensive to get married!" - Comrade Liu Laifa, a new soldier of the 2135th Company, has been studying very diligently since joining the army and is particularly active in his work. Recently, he received letters from his family and village, mainly wanting him to go home and get married. He wrote back to the village cadres saying, "With your help, my marriage has been arranged, and I am very happy. But in order to defend the fruits of liberation, I will not go back. I will talk about marriage after Chiang Kai-shek is completely defeated." Another letter was written to his mother, saying, "Mother: My marriage can be discussed later. Now is the time for a great counter-offensive. I am determined to make contributions in the counter-offensive and strive to become a hero. At that time, it will be glorious to go home and get married." The last letter was to his fiancée: "Comrade Aitang: I am very happy that you are willing to marry me. Now it is not that the superiors do not allow us to marry, but that Chiang Kai-shek does not allow us to marry. If we want to get married, we can only defeat Chiang Kai-shek, then it will no longer be a problem. I am determined to liberate all the suffering people in China like us and strive to make contributions and become a hero. Then it will be so glorious when we get married!"
    He said to the instructor: "Although I have been liberated now, I will never forget the pain of the past. Chiang Kai-shek has not been killed yet, and the hatred has not been avenged. Do you think I can go back and get married now?"
    ◇ Liberated Soldier Li Shao said: "Make contributions to liberate my hometown!" - After a certain unit held a heroes' meeting, the heroes were welcomed back with gongs and drums, which moved many comrades to express their determination and make plans to make contributions in the great counter-offensive and strive to attend the next heroes' meeting. Ma Yongde, who was liberated from Tangyin, said: "The Eighth Route Army never buries talent. Becoming a hero is more glorious than passing the imperial examination. I am determined to strive to be a hero in killing the enemy in the great counter-offensive." Wei Dengyun said: "Being a hero is too glorious!" Li Shao, who was liberated in the Niu Shi Tun battle, said: "How could there be glory in being a soldier for Chiang Kai-shek in the past? Now we are soldiers for the people, and we can become meritorious servants of the people. Lin Laiwang and Wang Xianda have become heroes and are glorious. Why can't I be a hero!" He reviewed his backward thinking when he first came over, saying, "I was clearly working for myself, but I still wanted to desert! Now I understand that only by uprooting Chiang Kai-shek, this scourge, can I not be drafted and cause my family to be separated. In this great counter-offensive, I must make contributions to liberate my hometown!"
    ◇ Combat hero Wang Shijun did not forget to make contributions even in the hospital. - Comrade Wang Jun, a combat hero of the 4014th Company, returned to the team before his injury at Zhao Jia Chang had healed. He bravely took the lead in the Ta Gang battle and was seriously injured again. He did not say discouraging words, but comforted the comrades in the class, saying, "You must complete the task and don't worry about me." He wholeheartedly recuperated from his injury and rushed back to the troops to make contributions, and hoped that all the wounded would do the same. So when his wound was slightly lighter, he voluntarily helped the seriously wounded to fetch water and food. When he returned to the team, the hospital's letter of introduction stated: "Comrade Wang Shijun has made contributions in the hospital, is active and hardworking, and deserves a great merit." Comrade Wang Shijun said: "It's nothing, this is how a people's soldier should be." On the way back to the troops, he rushed to make a plan to kill the enemy and make contributions in the great counter-offensive.
    ◇ People's Meritorious Servants said: "We must add merit upon merit in the great counter-offensive!" - At the merit celebration meeting of the 4012th squad, the representative of the meritorious servants said: "We will never be arrogant because we have made contributions, and we will also help our comrades make contributions. Responding to the call of the leaders, we must practice the four major techniques well, and add merit upon merit in the great counter-offensive!" Yin Haijiao, a hero in killing the enemy of the 12131st detachment, encountered live-fire machine gun shooting as soon as he returned from the heroes' meeting. Many new shooters started to miss the target a lot, so he voluntarily came out to teach everyone and personally fired five rounds, all of which hit the target. A total of 30 people participated, consuming 150 bullets, scoring 679 rings, with an average of 22.6 rings per person. New shooter Wang Baosong scored 40 rings with five shots, and Li Qiyong, Wen Yulin, and Zhao Fulu all scored more than 30 rings. (Tian Ergeng, Han Guangzu, Zhang Wenqing, Wen Sheng, Lian Zhu)

　　大反攻中立大功！
  　战士兴高采烈　决心大显身手
    【本报讯】大反攻声中，我人民解放军战士们，个个兴高彩烈，磨刀擦掌，准备在这伟大的行动中大显身手，为人民立下永垂不朽的功勋：
    ◇新战士刘来法说：“等到反攻胜利再结婚！”——二一三五连新战士刘来法同志，自到部队后，学习很用心。工作也特别积极。最近接到家里与村中的来信，主要是想叫他回家结婚，他给村干部的回信上说：“在你们的帮助下，我的婚姻成了，我很高兴。但是我为了保卫翻身果实，我不回去，等彻底打垮蒋介石再谈结婚。”另一封是给他母亲写的，信中说：“母亲：我的婚事以后再说，现在正要大反攻，我下决心要在反攻中立功，争取当英雄。到那时，光荣的再回家结婚。”最后一封是给他未婚妻的信：“爱棠同志：你愿意和我结婚，我很高兴。现在并不是上级不准咱结婚，是蒋介石不许咱们结婚。咱们要想结婚，只有把蒋介石打垮，那时就不成问题。我决心要解救全中国和咱们一样受苦受难的老百姓，争取立功当英雄，那时咱们再结婚你看有多光荣！”
    他向指导员说：“我现在虽翻了身，可是永忘不了过去的痛苦。蒋介石还没有被打死，仇还没报，你说我现在还能回去结婚吗？”
    ◇解放战士李绍说：“为解放我家乡立功！”——某部开罢群英会，锣鼓暄天把英雄们接回来，感动的好多同志都表示了决心，订出了计划要在大反攻中立功，争取出席下次群英大会。汤阴解放来的马永德说：“八路军就是不埋没人，当了英雄比中状元还光荣，我决心要在大反攻中也争个杀敌英雄。”魏登云说：“当英雄太光荣啦！”牛市屯战斗中解放过来的李绍说：“过去给蒋介石当兵怎么能有光荣？现是给人民当兵，就能当人民功臣。林来旺、王先达都当了英雄光荣啦，我为什么不能当英雄！”他检讨刚过来时的落后思想说：“明明是为自己办事，还想开小差呢！现在想通了，只有拔掉蒋介石这个祸根，俺才不致被抓丁，使得家人失散。这次大反攻，俺一定要为解放自己家乡立功！”
    ◇战斗英雄王世俊在医院里也不忘立功。——四○一四连战斗英雄王俊同志赵家厂负伤未好就归队，塔岗战斗勇敢带头又负重伤，没有说泄气话，还安慰班内同志说：“你们要完成任务，不要挂念我。”他一心一意把伤养好，赶回部队立功，并希望所有伤员都这样。所以当他伤口较轻一点，便自动帮助重伤员打水、打饭。当他归队的时候，医院的介绍信上写着：“王世俊同志在院有功，工作积极吃苦，记一大功。”王世俊同志说：“没有什么，做一个人民战士应该是这样。”在回部队的路上，便赶着订大反攻中的杀敌立功计划。
    ◇人民功臣说：“要在大反攻中功上加功！”——四○一二小队开贺功会时，功臣代表讲话说：“我们有了功劳绝不骄傲，还要帮助同志们立功。响应首长号召，练好四大技术，要在大反攻中，功上加功！”一二一三一分队杀敌英雄尹海蛟，才从群英会回来就碰到机枪实弹射击，有许多新射手开始脱靶很多，他就自动出来教大家，并亲自打了五发，都是弹弹命中。共参加人数三十名，消耗子弹一百五十发，中六百七十九环，每人平均二十二·六环。新射手王保松五枪打了四十环，李其永、温玉林、赵福禄都是三十环以上。（田二耕、韩光祖、张文清、文升、连珠）
