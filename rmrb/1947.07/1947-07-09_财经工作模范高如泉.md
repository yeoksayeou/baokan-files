　　Financial Work Model Gao Ruquan
    Ji Lu Yu Sixth Special Commissioner Office Communications Group
    Comrade Gao Ruquan is the financial assistant in the Fifth District of Renping in the Sixth Special District. He joined the family member of martyrs factory in 1941 and transferred to the financial department in 1943. At the meritorious service selection meeting for financial cadres in the Sixth Sub-district on May 22nd, he was selected as a first-class model. He has many exemplary deeds that are worth learning from.
    First, he used grain to exchange for cloth to support mass production and save government expenses. The county government assigned the district the task of 46,000 chi of native cloth, with each chi stipulated as (1.6 chi long and 0.8 chi wide) 4.7 jin of millet. He went to the villages and discussed with the masses, stipulating a standard cloth, and then deciding on the price of 4 to 4.6 jin of millet per chi of cloth based on the quality of the native cloth (based on the price of cotton at the time, the masses could get a profit of 1.6 jin of millet per chi of cloth, excluding labor costs). Grain was issued first and then the cloth was handed over. Women competed to weave cloth and hand it over to the government, which also improved the quality of the native cloth. After the district's native cloth task was completed, the average price per chi of cloth was equivalent to 4.3 jin of millet. According to the county government's stipulated amount, 0.4 jin of millet was saved per chi, which saved 11,500 jin of millet based on 46,000 chi of native cloth.
    Second, he cleared warehouses, eliminated empty villages, resolved outstanding cases, and increased income. In Shelangkou Village, there was a total of 15,420 jin of public grain stored. Most of the grain depositors were landlords. During the mass movement, the landlords gave the public grain to the masses as their own floating wealth. Some villages misappropriated a portion of it, so all the grain turned into empty promises. Under the principle of resolving outstanding cases, eliminating empty villages, strictly pursuing responsibility, and clarifying rewards and punishments as instructed by the Commissioner Office, he personally went to the village, held a mass meeting, and asked the masses to find a way to solve the problem. The masses proposed to recover the arrears owed by the landlords during the enemy and puppet era to compensate for the loss of public grain. Therefore, he supported the masses in demanding that the landlords pay the burdens they had not paid during the enemy and puppet era to pay for the public grain. As a result, in addition to compensating for the loss of public grain, he also recovered an additional 2,000 jin of arrears. This treatment allowed the masses to vent their anger, and the masses supported it very much.
    Third, he was firm and resourceful. During the famine in 1943, when disaster relief grain was transferred from Dong'a and other counties to Renping, he was responsible for escorting it. At that time, he had to pass through enemy-infested pillboxes and blockaded trenches, and there was no armed escort. He told the laborers how the troops would protect them to boost their courage, and on the other hand, he threatened the enemy, saying that the troops would pass through the strongholds and would not be allowed to leave the trenches, otherwise they would level the trenches. The enemy did not know the truth and did not dare to act rashly, so he transported the grain three times in a row, safely transferring nearly 200,000 jin of disaster relief grain.
    Fourth, he was honest and dedicated to public service, without the slightest negligence. He returned the extra grain coupons given to him by others three times. The first time, the manager of the family member of martyrs factory gave him 1,700 jin of rice coupons. He found out and returned them all. The second time, the finance section mistakenly issued 3,000 jin of rice coupons as 3,000 jin of firewood coupons. He also returned them in full. The third time, the construction section mistakenly gave him 50 jin of grain coupons as 10 jin of grain coupons. Some comrades advocated using the extra grain to improve the food, but he firmly opposed this incorrect idea and returned the extra grain coupons.
    Fifth, he strictly grasped the financial and administrative system. Under his leadership in the district, he had once made an unauthorized decision to levy 5 jin of wheat per mu to purchase guns. He insisted that the burden on the masses should not be increased and reported it to the higher authorities, stopping the levy and reducing the burden on the people.
    Sixth, he conducted detailed investigations and balanced the burden. In the past, the district had not conducted accurate investigations and statistics on the manpower and materials supporting the front lines. As a result, based on the self-reported vehicles from each village, there were more than 300 vehicles and more than 1,000 head of livestock in the district. After he personally conducted in-depth investigations, the result was that there were a total of 805 carts and 2,600 head of livestock in the 60 administrative villages of the district, and more than 4,000 young and middle-aged people of the age eligible for labor service, making the burden of labor service and transportation for the masses reasonable, and the district had a good grasp of the manpower and materials supporting the front lines.
    Seventh, he organized production, solved village public expenses, and reduced the village burden. While ensuring the supply to the front lines, he advocated that villages jointly mill rice. In addition to delivering the cleaned rice to the higher authorities, the remaining broken rice and rice bran were used to pay for village office expenses. The district obtained a total of 16,000 jin of broken rice and 60,000 jin of rice bran. According to the exchange rate of 40 jin of red grain for every 100 jin of bran, a total of 24,000 jin of red grain was exchanged. Every 1.5 jin of red grain was equivalent to 1 jin of rice, which could be converted into 16,000 jin of rice. Together with the broken rice, there were a total of 32,000 jin, which could cover the village public expenses for eight months in the district, greatly reducing the burden on the masses.
    Eighth, he conducted in-depth research, calculated accurately, and prevented waste. When burying public grain, the administrative office stipulated a depreciation rate of 5% (that is, 50 jin of depreciation could be reported for burying 1,000 jin of grain). The villages often said that it was not enough and reported more depreciation. He personally inspected a pit that stored 3,800 jin of grain. Not only was the public grain not short, but it increased by 40.5 jin. After weighing the firewood and bran in the pit after drying, only 200 jin of firewood and 60 jin of bran were lost. If the depreciated firewood and bran were converted into millet, it would be a total of 75 jin. If calculated according to the 5% depreciation rate, 190 jin of depreciation should be reported for 3,800 jin of public grain. After his inspection, not only was there no shortage, but 115 jin of grain was also saved. According to the percentage, the pit of 3,800 jin of grain only lost about 2% of the grain due to wind.
    Ninth, he created a preferential treatment work point system for military families to resolve the conflict between military families and the masses. The masses in the district felt that helping military families with work was a heavy burden, so they did not do a good job when helping military families, which also caused dissatisfaction among military families and increased a lot of trouble for the district and village governments. He statistically analyzed the military families and printed 14,200 work points in the district, calculating how much help each military family needed for the whole year and issuing them that many work points. When a military family needed someone to help them with work, they would give the worker a work point for each work unit they did. These work points could be used to offset labor service for supporting the front lines without affecting the labor service for supporting the front lines. After the implementation of this work point system, not only was the waste of labor greatly reduced, but the military families also truly received preferential treatment for labor, so both the military families and the masses were satisfied.
    From the above main model deeds, Comrade Gao Ruquan is closely connected with the masses. He always considers the interests of the masses, follows the mass line, and learns from the people at all times. He deeply understands that the experience of the masses is the richest and most practical. Comrade Gao Ruquan's enthusiasm and creativity in serving the people is worth learning from.

　　财经工作模范高如泉
    冀鲁豫六专署通讯组
    高如泉同志是六专区荏平五区财经助理员。一九四一年参加抗属工厂工作，四三年即转入财经部门。他在五月二十二日六分区财经干部立功选模大会上，当选甲等模范。他有不少模范事迹，是值得大家学习的。
    第一、以粮换布扶持群众生产，节省政府开支。县府布置该区四万六千尺土布任务，每尺规定（尺六长、八寸宽）小米四斤七两。他到村里和群众商量，规定标准布，再按土布质量好坏决定每尺布小米四斤至四斤六两，（按当时棉花价，除了人工，每尺布群众可得利润小米一斤六两）先发粮食后交布，妇女争着织布交政府，又提高了土布质量。全区土布任务完成后，每尺布平均折价合小米四斤三两，按县府规定数，每尺节省小米四两，以四万六千尺土布计算，就节省了小米一万一千五百斤。
    第二、清理仓房、消灭空屯、解决悬案，增加收入。在社郎口村前后共存公粮一万五千四百二十斤，存粮户多是地主，在群众运动中地主把公粮当自己浮财给了群众，有的村中挪用一部分，因此全部粮食都变为空头支票。在专署指示解决悬案、消灭空屯、严追责任、明确赏罚之原则下，他亲自到该村，召开群众大会，叫群众想法解决。群众提议追交地主在敌伪时代之陈欠填补公粮之损失，于是他给群众撑着腰向地主讨要敌伪时代不出之负担交纳公粮。结果，除补偿了公粮损失外，还多追了二千斤的陈欠，这样处理可给群众出口气，群众很拥护。
    第三、坚定机智。四三年灾荒时期由东阿等县向荏平调剂救灾粮时，由他负责押运，当时要经过敌人林立的碉堡与封锁沟，又无武装护送，他就一面向民夫说部队如何保护，以壮车夫之胆，另一面威胁敌人说部队要经过据点，不准出沟，否则平沟过。敌人不知虚实，不敢妄动，他就连续运了三次，平平安安的调剂了近二十万斤救灾粮。
    第四、廉洁奉公，丝毫不苟。他曾三次退回别人多给他的粮票，第一次抗属工厂经理多给他一千七百斤米票，他查出全数退回。第二次财经科误以米票三千斤当柴票三千斤发给，他又如数退回。第三次建设科误以五十斤粮票当十斤粮票给了他，有的同志主张把多收的粮食改善伙食，他坚决反对这种不正确的主张，仍将多收的粮票退回。
    第五、严格掌握财务行政制度。在他区领导上，曾擅自决定每亩摊派五斤麦子购买枪支，他一面坚持不应增加群众负担，一面反映到上级，停止了摊派，减轻人民的负担。
    第六、精细调查，平衡负担。该区过去在支援前线人力物力上，未经过精确调查统计，因而根据各村自报之车辆全区共三百余辆，牲口千余头，后经他亲自深入调查的结果全区六十个行政村，共大车八百零五辆，牲口二千六百头，合支差年龄的青老壮年四千余名，使群众之支差运输力量的负担，取得合理，而该区支援前线的人力物力上也有了把握。
    第七、组织生产，解决村公费，减轻村负担。在保障前线供给时，他提倡村合伙碾米，除上解净米外，所剩下的碎米及谷糠，供给村办公费用。全区共得碎米一万六千斤，谷糠六万斤，按每百斤糠换红粮四十斤：共计换红粮二万四千斤，每斤半红粮折米一斤，可折米一万六千斤，加上碎米共三万二千斤。可供全区八个月村公费的开支，大大减轻了群众负担。
    第八、深入研究，精确计算，防止浪费。埋藏公粮，行署规定报销百分之五的损耗数（即埋一千斤粮食可报销五十斤损耗数），各村往往说不够而报销的多。他就亲自检查一个藏粮三千八百斤的一个坑子，公粮不但未短秤，而涨了四十斤零半斤，再把坑子的柴及糠晒干过秤，只损耗柴二百斤，糠六十斤，如把损耗柴糠折成小米共计七十五斤，如按百分之五损耗计算，三千八百斤公粮，应报损耗一百九十斤，经他这次检查，结果不仅未有赔秤，而且损耗粮也节省了一百一十五斤，要按百分数算，这个埋粮三千八百斤的坑子，只损耗了百分之二弱的风耗数字。
    第九、创造优军工票制，解决军属与群众之矛盾。该区群众帮助军属做活，感觉是个很大负担，因此给军属做活时也不好好的去做，又引起军属不满，区村政权也增加不少麻烦，他就把军属统计了一下，全区印了一万四千二百张工票，计算每个军属全年需要帮工多少，就发给他多少工票，军属拿了工票，军属找谁给他做一个工，就给做工的一个工票，这种工票可抵前方支差，而又不影响支援前线之支差。这种工票制实行后，不但大大减少劳力的浪费现象，而军属也真正得天劳力的优待，所以军属与群众都满意。
    从以上几个主要模范事迹来看，高如泉同志和群众紧密的联系着，他处处为群众利益着想，走群众路线，时时刻刻向人民群众学习，他深刻体会到群众经验，是最丰富最实际的。高如泉同志这种为人民群众服务的积极性与创造性，值得大家学习。
