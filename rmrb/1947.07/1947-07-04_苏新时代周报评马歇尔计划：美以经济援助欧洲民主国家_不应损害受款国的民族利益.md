Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 27th - The New Times Weekly published an editorial stating: If European countries can obtain credit loans and goods from the United States, their economic recovery will be greatly facilitated and accelerated. The United States' production, during the war, was not reduced, but expanded; therefore, it is able to give such assistance to European countries. Moreover, from the perspective of the United States' own welfare, it is also beneficial for the United States that European countries quickly recover from the wounds of war, because that will make the resumption of normal trade possible. European countries fully understand that economic assistance from the United States should not only be fair but also mutually beneficial to both sides. Therefore, it is quite clear that the core of the issue is not a charitable act, but a commercial transaction. European countries and the United States are equally concerned about this transaction. However, the general public and political leaders in European countries see that American aid often comes with conditions attached, and these conditions are incompatible with the national interests or national dignity of sovereign states. The conditions attached to loans to Greece and Turkey based on the so-called "Truman Doctrine" are unacceptable to any democratic country in Europe. Only anti-popular ruling groups that cannot gain domestic support and try to replace it with the support of foreign financial circles can agree to such conditions. This kind of assistance is inseparable from direct interference in the internal affairs of the loan-receiving country, and it does not help to restore their economy. For example, Greece has long been receiving so-called assistance from Britain first and then the United States, both in money and goods, but Greece is sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire of economic crisis. Therefore, when discussing the United States' economic assistance to European democratic countries, any conditions that infringe upon their national sovereignty and independence in internal and foreign policies must be rejected from the outset, whether from the perspective of individual countries or from the perspective of the general national economy, these conditions are unacceptable. Newspaper and magazine comments on the Marshall proposal show that the first question that arises in the hearts of the general public in European democratic countries is what relationship the Marshall proposal has with the "Truman Doctrine." Any real chance of success for the Marshall Plan depends entirely on the answer to this question. The Marshall proposal is stated only in the most general terms. However, the defenders of the "Western Bloc" are already preparing to treat this proposal as a step that can be used to advance the Churchill Plan. The purpose of the Churchill Plan is not to unite all aspects of Europe's efforts, restore its economy, and return to normal international trade relations, but to stipulate "disagreeable and very unscrupulous purposes." It is still difficult to say to what extent the assistance to Europe proposed by the US Secretary of State can be realized and to what extent it can achieve its goals. If a serious economic plan is intended to develop and strengthen the economies of European countries and stabilize international trade, there is no doubt that the people of European countries and their governments will support such a plan.

### 苏新时代周报评马歇尔计划：美以经济援助欧洲民主国家　不应损害受款国的民族利益

　　苏新时代周报评马歇尔计划：美以经济援助欧洲民主国家　不应损害受款国的民族利益
    【新华社莫斯科二十七日电】新时代周刊发表社论称：欧洲国家如果能从美国获得信用贷款与货物一类的帮助，它们的经济恢复会大大的顺利而加速。美国的生产，在战争期间，远不是减缩了，而是扩大了；因此它能够给欧洲国家以这样的帮助。而且，从美国自己的福利出发，欧洲国家尽速平复战争的创伤，对于美国也是有利的，因为那将使正常贸易的恢复成为可能。欧洲各国充分了解：来自美国的经济帮助不仅要公平，而且对于双方要是互利的。所以，十分明白，问题的中心并不是什么慈善的行为，而是商业的交易。对于这种交易，欧洲国家和美国是同样的关心。然而，欧洲国家的人民大众和政治领袖看到：美国的帮助实际上常常附带着条件，而这些条件是和自主国的民族利益或者国家的尊严不能并存的。象以所谓“杜鲁门主义”为根据而加诸希腊和土耳其的贷款的条件，没有一个欧洲的民主国家，能够认为在这类条件上的信用或贷款是可以接受的。只有反人民的统治集团在国内得不到支持而力图代之以外国金融界的支持，才能够同意这类条件。这类帮助是和对于接受贷款国家内政的直接干涉分不开的，而且对于恢复它们的经济也无所裨助。例如希腊很久以来，都在接受着首先是英国的后来是美国的所谓帮助，有金钱也有货物，然而希腊正在陷入经济危机的泥淖里，愈陷愈深。因之，在讨论美国以经济帮助欧洲民主国家的时候，凡是侵害它们的国家主权和内政外交政策上之独立性的一切条件，都必须从一开始就加以拒绝，无论是从各别国家的观点出发或者从一般的国家经济的观点出发，这些条件都是不可接受的。报章杂志对于马歇尔提议的评论表示出：在欧洲民主国家人民大众的心里兴起的第一个问题就是马歇尔的提议究竟对“杜鲁门主义”采取什么关系。马歇尔计划能以成功的任何真正的机会，全靠对于这个问题的答复。马歇尔的提议只不过是用最一般的词句陈述出来了。然而“西方集团”的卫士们已经准备把这个提议当作可用以推进邱吉尔计划的步骤。而邱吉尔计划的目的，并不是团结欧洲各方面的努力，恢复它的经济和回到正常的国际贸易关系，而是规定了“不同意而又非常肆无忌惮的目的”。现在还很难说，美国国务卿所提议的援助欧洲究竟能实现到如何程度，又能达到其目的至如何程度。如果一个认真的经济方案是意图发展及加强欧洲国家的经济并稳定国际贸易，毫无疑义，欧洲国家的人民和它们的政府都会支持这种方案。
