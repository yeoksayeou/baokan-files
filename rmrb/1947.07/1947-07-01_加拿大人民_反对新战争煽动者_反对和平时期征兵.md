  　Oppose New War Mongers, Oppose Conscription in Peacetime
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd. TASS Ottawa reported: A reporter from the Daily Tribune reported that representatives of people's groups in Quebec strongly oppose the implementation of conscription in Canada during peacetime. Greenness, the editor of the newspaper "Combat," said: "Truman's bellicose declaration to the Americans and the call for continental military cooperation, followed by a visit to Canada, is not a sightseeing trip. Now is the time to awaken Prime Minister King with a strong protest. Canada is unwilling to take the path of inciting war and unwilling to pay the price for new conflicts!" Pelletier, the leader of the Quebec Power Workers' Union, declared: "We in Canada long for a peaceful and secure life, and we do not want conscription and crazy war adventures."

  　反对新战争煽动者　反对和平时期征兵
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】塔斯社渥太华讯：每日论坛报记者报导称：魁北克省民众团体代表强烈反对和平时期在加拿大实行征兵。进行报纸“战斗”报的编辑格林纳斯说：“杜鲁门在美国人的好战的宣言及大陆军事合作的呼吁之后，拜访加拿大，这不是游览性的旅行。现在是以强有力的抗议使总理金氏清醒的时候了，加拿大不愿采取煽动战争的路线，不愿为新的冲突而支付代价！”魁北克电力工人联盟的领袖派勒特宣称：“我们在加拿大切望和平及安全的生活，而不希望征兵和疯狂的战争冒险。”
