　　[This newspaper reports] In Gan Town, District Nine of Wei County, even after seven re-examinations, landlords were not completely eliminated. Many landlords, after being struggled against, ate and drank extravagantly, swaggering through the market after buying things. The mother of ×× in Back Street expressed hostility towards female peasant members after being struggled against. Therefore, the masses, while weeding, planned the eighth campaign to pursue and annihilate landlords. Once the planning matured, the pursuit and annihilation began, with thorough liquidation conducted against landlords who were not thoroughly dealt with previously. During the general meeting, the reasoning of the masses and the sounds of shouting and striking reverberated through the clouds. After several pursuits, the landlords' ferocity was suppressed, and they truly lowered their heads to the masses. A total of 250 mu of land, 46 rooms, 4,700 jin of wheat, 1,047 jin of millet, 1,920 jin of miscellaneous grains, 1,115 pieces of farm tools and furniture, 216 chests and trunks, 74 quilts, and 57 taels of silver were recovered. After the struggle ended, everyone, in their review, believed that this struggle was thorough and clean, and did not delay agricultural work. To avoid delaying production, the 250 mu of land that had been struggled out has now been completely sown by the farmers' association and mutual aid teams. The seeds are provided by the farmers' association, and whoever is allocated the land will pay wages later. Currently, the masses are planning to distribute the floating wealth, combining mutual aid for weeding and hoeing.

　　一面锄苗一面酝酿干集八次追歼地主
  　追出土地二百五十亩全部下种
    【本报讯】威县九区干镇经过七次复查，地主仍未彻底消灭，不少地主被斗后大吃大喝，在集上买了东西摇摇摆摆。后街××娘被斗后对农妇会员表示仇视，因此，群众在锄苗中酝酿对地主展开第八次追歼战。酝酿成熟，即开始进行追歼，对以前不彻底地主，逐一进行清算。大会上说理群众喊声打声响彻云霄，经过几次的追，压倒了地主的凶焰，真正向群众低了头。共追出土地二百五十亩，房四十六间，麦子四千七百斤，谷子一千零四十七斤，杂粮一千九百二十斤，农具家具一千一百一十五件，柜箱二百一十六件，被子七十四床，银子一块重五十七两。斗争结束后，大家在检讨中，认为这次斗的彻底干净，不误农时，为了不误生产，现已将斗出之二百五十亩地，由农会与互助组完全种上，种籽由农会出，以后谁分地谁出工资。目前群众正酝酿分浮财，结合互助耘地锄苗。
