　　The Creation of Emancipated Peasants, the Harvest of the Merit Campaign:
    Liangyuan Military Reception Station

  　(I) Soldiers Feel at Home at the Station
    Located on the main road north and south of the Pinghan Railway, exactly twenty miles from both Neiqiu and Xingtai, the Liangyuan Military Reception Station is busy every day with rumbling vehicles and a constant stream of pedestrians, warmly receiving passing soldiers. According to statistics from February to May, the average daily number of passing soldiers provided with meals and lodging is over sixty, and the number who drink water and rest briefly is impossible to count.
    When you enter the north-south main street of Liangyuan, and reach the crossroads, the large characters of the Military Reception Station on the west street will appear before you. On both sides of the door are written: "Establish military stations (note: i.e., reception stations) for the masses, produce for the soldiers themselves." Entering the gate, you will see their working slogan: "Self-reliance builds the military station, production and thrift support the front lines, guarantee the army's water and meals, and do not waste rice and grain." It truly introduces the entire content of this reception station very sincerely.
    In the two large courtyards, awnings are set up, and the rooms are cool and clean. There is always boiling water in the large pots, waiting for passing soldiers. I saw groups of People's Liberation Army soldiers marching in the scorching heat enter the reception station, and immediately tea and washbasins were brought to them. If they wanted to stay, the bedding was very clean, and they would feel very comfortable washing their feet and eating. Cornmeal buns, mixed flour soup, and stir-fried vegetables are the standard meals. If they encountered wounded or sick soldiers, veterans, or military and political leaders, they would receive extra care. White flour and eggs were also regularly prepared for guest meals. In addition, the reception station has a restaurant on the main street that it uses for its own production and business. The large characters at the door tell you: "In order to take care of soldiers' meals, all soldiers and cadres, and family members of soldiers of all levels with certificates, and veterans, will receive a 28% discount from the market price, and tea is free."
    The Liangyuan Reception Station is well-known among soldiers, and soldiers passing through here will have a deep impression. In February, a unit of the First Military Sub-district passed through here, and the soldiers were well received. Before leaving, they wrote large characters on the wall: "Entering the reception station, tea and meals are convenient, having traveled to many places, this is the first time we've seen this." The leader of a certain regiment of the ×Column stayed at the station for one night, and said to the stationmaster Chen Shiliang before leaving: "The masses in the rear take such good care of the army, I will tell the soldiers at the front to kill more enemies to protect the fruits of the masses' emancipation." A patient from ×× regiment stayed here, and the reception station prepared white flour and eggs for him, and served him very diligently. When he left, he said: "This is more affectionate than being treated at my own home!" Originally, a meal was fifteen taels of rice coupons, but he finally gave twenty-four taels. Several veteran soldiers who often traveled north and south, upon arriving at the station, said: "It's like coming home again." A few days ago, friendly troops from the ×× Military Region passed through here. After receiving special treatment, a comrade surnamed Liao said to his comrades: "The people here are eating sorghum mixed with bran to get through the famine year, and they still make good meals for us, it's really..." In March, twenty family members of soldiers from Linzan went to Anyang to visit the soldiers. They said: "Staying here is like being at home!" Xingtai postal workers Lao Mao and Lao Li had to rush to stay at the station every morning and evening. He said, "This is even better than home."
    (II) The Past and Present of the Reception Station
    Looking at the current situation of the reception station, one cannot help but ask about the tortuous history of this reception station. When the reception station was not established last spring, the fifteen cadres of Liangyuan Village had to regularly receive passing soldiers in the village. Each household in the village took turns making meals for the soldiers on average every other day. At that time, the masses had difficulty burning fuel because high-stalk plants were prohibited in the enemy-occupied areas along the railway. They were assigned to provide meals but had no firewood to burn. When they couldn't make meals, the masses complained, and the soldiers were not satisfied either. Later, even broken shoes and grass roots were burned, and the labor burden was still quite heavy. The masses at the time expressed doubts about this policy and asked to move. The cadres felt they couldn't continue working. When the reception station was established in February last year, the villages in the entire district supported it with grain, money, and labor. There were three people at the station, and the burden on the masses was reduced, but the passing soldiers still had complaints. In addition to eating millet rice, it was difficult to improve their lives. Once, several soldiers wrote the following on the wall outside the village before leaving: "Coming to Liangyuan, first they give you plain water to drink, then they give you millet rice to eat; the masses eat white flour (at the time, wheat had just been harvested), and the soldiers eat millet rice." In this way, the station still had to lose 200 jin of rice, 200 jin of charcoal, 5 jin of oil, and 30 jin of salt every month. The soldiers were received, but in the end, neither the army nor the people were happy.
    Since February of this year, under the call to reduce the burden on the masses and fully support the front lines, a merit campaign was launched at the entire station. Stationmaster Chen Shiliang led the entire station to actively engage in production, organize agricultural and sideline income, cultivate 23 mu of public land in the village, and organize two restaurants and a flour mill. Now there are enough people at the station (stationmaster, accountant, receptionist, cook), and seven production workers who are combined with family production are also employed. Over the past three months, under the arduous efforts of everyone in "everything for the front lines," they have achieved more than self-sufficiency, improved the lives of passing soldiers, and received a good response from the soldiers. It has also solved the difficulties in the homes of the station cadres and directly reduced the burden on the masses. Talking about the past and present of the reception station has filled the people of Yuandian with emotion. Village chief Pang Jincai said: "Without this reception station, our village would have no way to cultivate the land; without Chen Shiliang, there would be no such reception station."
    (III) Everyone Has Made Merit
    Stationmaster Chen Shiliang is an emancipated peasant with a high sense of responsibility to serve the masses and organizational planning ability. In February of this year, he saw reports in the newspaper about the merit campaign being carried out in various places, which aroused his desire to make merit. He saw that the station members were not in high spirits, and he also realized that criticism and self-criticism alone could not solve the problem. Therefore, at the meeting of all station members, he first set out his own merit plan. In addition to leading everyone to receive soldiers, he used his spare time to organize sideline income (selling cloth and transporting salt), striving to earn 100,000 yuan per month to subsidize the station's expenses. Then everyone else set out their merit plans. Accountant Chen Guangyao set out: "In addition to mastering accounting and allocation, I will also participate in production and sweep the yard." Receptionist Chen Shiyou guaranteed: "Cultivate the 21 mu of land and 2 mu of vegetable garden at the station, and also cultivate the land for the ten station members' families." The cook, Li Genhu, set out a plan: the food must be made well, quickly, hygienically, and thriftily. In the past, four dou of wheat were milled every day, but in the future, five dou must be milled every day. The livestock must be fed well, and the fodder must be reduced. The two restaurants set out a plan: "Soldiers must be well received, and military cadres, family members of martyrs, and veterans will receive a 28% discount. Water is free, and the attitude towards general customers should be kind, and more money should be earned to subsidize the station's expenses." Their meeting system is regular and serious, with a review meeting every ten days and a merit evaluation every half month. In the first merit evaluation, Zhang Guangyao, Chen Shiying, and Li Genhu all completed their merit plans and were credited once. And recently, another merit evaluation is about to take place. Chen Shiliang has exceeded his production plan. In the past month, he has seized the spare time to engage in sideline businesses, earning 120,000 yuan, exceeding the original plan by 20,000 yuan. According to the stationmaster, during the Dragon Boat Festival, he was allowed to withdraw 1,000 yuan per person from the organizational income as a bonus, and another 5,000 yuan was proposed as a merit-based bonus. Over the past three months, from the stationmaster to the cook, everyone has been working hard to complete the merit plan. Although the collective has made merit, it has not only achieved self-sufficiency and improved the lives of soldiers, but has also exceeded a fairly astonishing number. In the past three months, the reception of soldiers has resulted in a loss of 1,207 jin and 13 taels of millet, 96 jin and 13 taels of white flour, 172,000 yuan in vegetable money, and 100,000 yuan in other miscellaneous expenses for cadres' clothing, totaling 538,000 yuan. This is an astonishing figure for expenditure, but the figure for income is even more astonishing. The two restaurants earned 230,000 yuan, buying wheat and milling flour earned 500,000 yuan, Chen Shiliang alone earned 120,000 yuan, and raising pigs earned 24,500 yuan, totaling 874,500 yuan. After deducting expenses and achieving self-sufficiency, there is still a surplus of 336,000 yuan. And what about the future? Stationmaster Chen said with full confidence: "In the first three months, we spent more than 100,000 yuan just on buying vegetables. Now, the two mu of vegetable garden can supply vegetables for the troops, and we have a capital base. In any case, achieving complete self-sufficiency and further improving the lives of passing soldiers is not a problem." I saw him and the station members busy all day long. I asked them, "Are you tired?" Cook Li Genhu said: "No matter how busy we are, can we be more tired than the soldiers at the front?! Who are they risking their lives and shedding blood for at the front?!"

　　翻身农民的创造，立功运动的收获：
    梁原店军人招待站
    子琦
  　（一）军人到店有如回家
    位于平汉路南北的大道上，距内邱、邢台恰恰都是二十里的梁原店军人招待站，天天在车属辚辚，行人不绝的忙碌中，亲切地接待着过路军人。据二月至五月的统计，每天平均招待吃饭住宿的过路军人即在六十名以上，其他喝水稍息片刻的，则无从统计。
    当你进了梁原店的南北大街，走到十字路口时，西街上的军人招待站，几个大字便出现在眼前，门口两旁写着：“为群众设立军站（按：即招待站），为军人自己生产”。进了大门，你便看见他们的工作口号：“自力更生招军站，生产节约援前线，保证军队水饭餐，不能浪费米粮钱”。它的确是很忠肯地介绍了这个招待站的整个内容。
    两个大院子内，架着天棚，屋子里清凉干净，大锅里常有开水，在等候过路军人。我看到一伙伙冒着炎暑行军的人民战士，进了招待站，立时茶水、洗脸盆都端到面前了，如果要住下了，床铺很整洁，洗脚吃饭都会感到很舒适的。米窝头，杂面汤，炒菜，是普通饭，如果遇上伤病彩号、荣退军人，军政首长、那还要格外照顾。白面鸡蛋也是常备的客饭，另外在大街上，还有招待站作为自己生产做买卖的一座饭店。门口的大字告诉你：“为了照顾军人吃饭，凡是军人干部，及有证明各级的军家属，荣退军人，一律按市价二八扣，茶水管喝。”
    梁原店招待站，在军人目中是很熟悉的，而且从这里路过的军人，都会有一个深刻印象的。二月间一分区××部队路过这里，战士们备受招待，临走时在墙上写下了大字：“进了招待站，茶饭都方便，走了多少处，这是头次见。”×纵队某团首长，在站上住了一夜，临走时对站长陈士亮说：“后方群众这样照顾军队，我要告诉前方战士们，要为保护群众的翻身果实多杀敌人。”××团的一个病号，住在这里，招待给他弄白面鸡蛋吃，伺候十分殷勤，他走时说：“这比我的家里待我还亲哩！”本来一顿饭是十五两米票，他最后给了二十四两。有几个南北常走的老战士，一来到站上，便说：“又回到家了。”前几日××军区友军部队，路过这里，受了特等招待后，一个姓辽的同志，对战友说：“这里老百姓吃高粱掺糠要渡荒年了，还给我们做好饭吃，真是……”三月间临赞二十名军属赴安阳看战士，他们说：“住在这里和家里一样！”邢台邮工老毛、老李每天早晚要赶到站上住，他说：“这比家里还好哩。”
    （二）招待站的今昔
    看了现在招待站的情景，不禁使人要追问，象这一招待站的曲折历史。当去年春季招待站未成立时，梁原店全村十五名干部，经常须在村招待过路军人，全村各户平均隔两天轮流一次，给军人做饭。当时群众因在敌占时，沿线禁种高杆植物，烧的相当困难，派了饭没柴烧，啥时做不了饭，群众喊冤，战士也不满意。以后连破鞋、青草根、都烧了，而且劳役负担还是相当重，群众在当时对此政策表示怀疑了，纷纷要求搬家，干部感觉也没法干了。去年二月招待站成立，全区各村支援粮款差役负担，站上有三个人，群众负担是减轻了，过路军人仍有怨言，除了吃小米饭外，很难来改善生活，有一次几个战士临走时在村外墙上这样写着：“来到梁原店，先叫喝白水，后叫吃米饭；群众吃白面，（当时刚割麦）军人吃米饭。”就这样，站上每月还得赔米二百斤、炭二百斤、油五斤、盐三十斤，军人是招待了，结果还是军民两方不讨好。
    从今年二月起，在减轻群众负担，全力支援前线的号召下，开展了全站立功运动，站长陈士亮领导全站积极生产，组织农副业收入养种了村中公产二十三亩地，组织了两个饭铺，一个磨面房，现在站上够四个人了，（站长会计招待员伙夫）还用了七个与家庭生产结合的生产员。三个月来，大家在“一切为了前线的”艰苦努力经营下，已经达到了生产自给有余，给过路军人改善了生活，得到军人的良好反映。而且解决了站上干部家中的困难，直接给群众减轻了负担，谈到招待站的今昔，使得原店群众无限感慨，村长庞金才说：“没有这招待站，俺村没法养种地；没有陈士亮，就没有这样的招待站。”
    （三）大家立了功
    站长陈士亮是一个翻身农民，有高度为群众服务的责任心与组织计划能力。今年二月他看到报上各地开展立功运动，激起了自己的立功愿望。他看到站员们情绪不高，也了解到光批评检讨不能解决问题，便在全体站员会上，首先订出了自己的立功计划？除了领导大家招待军人外，利用空隙时间组织副业收入（卖布运盐），争取每月赚十万元，补助站上的开支。接着大家也都订出了立功计划，会计陈光耀订出：“除了掌握记帐拨差外，还要参加生产，打扫院子，”招待员陈士友保证：“养种站上的二十一亩地及二亩菜园，并且还把十个站员家中的地都要代耕了。”做饭的李根虎订出计划：饭要做的好、快、卫生、省俭。过去每天磨麦四斗，今后每天要磨五斗，牲口要喂的肥，料要减轻，两个饭铺订出计划：“军人要招待好，军干烈属荣退军人一律二八扣。喝水不要钱，对普遍客人态度和气，要赚多钱补助站上开支。他们的会议制度竟是定期而认真的，十天一检讨会，半月一评功。第一次评功，张光耀、陈士英、李根虎都全部地完成了立功计划，分计功一次。而最近又要评功了，陈士亮已超过他的生产计划，一月来抓紧空隙搞副业，赚洋十二万元，超过原计划两万元。据站长谈在端午节时，准许从组织收入中，每人提奖一千元，另外提出五千元作评功奖。三个月来上至站长，下至伙夫，大家都是忙碌的工作着，为完成立功计划而努力。虽然是集体立了功，不但达到了自给，改善了军人生活，而且还超过相当惊人的数字，三个月中，招待军人共赔小米一二○七斤一三两，贴白面九六斤一三两，菜金十七万二千元，及其他干部衣服杂项开支十万元，共合需洋五十三万八千元。这是一个惊人的开支数字，但是收入的数字更惊人。两个饭铺赚洋二十三万元，籴麦子磨面赚洋五十万元，陈士亮一个人即赚了十二万元，喂猪赚了二万四千五百元，共合赚洋八十七万四千五百元，除了开支自给还余洋三十三万六千元。而今后呢，陈站长充满了胜利信心地说：“前三个月光买菜，就用洋十几万元，现在二亩菜园，已经能供上部队吃着菜了，而且有了资本基础了，无论如何达到全部自给，进一步给过路军人改善生活是不成问题的。我看到他与站员们，一天到晚的忙碌不停，试问他们‘累不’”？伙夫李根虎说：“无论怎样忙吧，比前线战士还能累了？！人家在前方拚命流血是为了谁？！”
