　　Local Hebei-Shandong-Henan Troops Annihilate Six Thousand Enemies in Three Months
    [Report from this newspaper in Hebei-Shandong-Henan on the 19th] (Delayed report) The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region Command recently announced the overall combat results of various local troops in the entire region for April, May, and June (June incomplete): a total of 6,299 enemies were annihilated, including 3,509 killed or wounded and 2,790 captured alive. The troops seized 40 cannons of various types, 93 light and heavy machine guns, 3,190 rifles and short guns, and 11 vehicles.
    [Report from this newspaper in Hebei-Shandong-Henan on the 20th] Armed organizations of liberated peasants in the border areas of Hua County and Changyuan County in Hebei-Shandong-Henan have established joint defense, cooperating with guerrillas to repeatedly repel invading Chiang Kai-shek troops. After the preliminary land reform of eliminating traitors and seeking revenge in Hua County, 300,000 peasants have generally been allocated land, their lives have been improved, and their political awareness has been raised. They have armed and organized themselves to establish joint defense teams to protect their homes and land. On the 30th, more than 900 peasants from Datun and Xuying areas in the northwest and southwest districts of the Second District gathered in Fengzhuang to discuss defending their gains and strengthening joint defense work. At that time, patrolling militiamen learned that over 200 enemy troops from Wang Sanzhu's unit were advancing from Daokou towards Hua County. This news immediately spread throughout the meeting place. Enraged, the peasants surged forward, some carrying red-tasseled spears, others wielding broadswords, and marched mightily towards Hua County. Many old women with bound feet, daughters-in-law, and children also refused to lag behind, joining the ranks, shouting passionately along the way: "Defend our liberated gains, drive out the Wang Sanzhu bandits!" When the contingent advanced to Xiguan, the enemy, seeing the vast momentum of our peasants, fled in panic to Xicang. The joint defense of the border areas of Changyuan County cooperated with the guerrillas to strike the enemy, achieving two victories in three days. On June 20th, over 30 members of the Nan Yuezhen Public Security Team, led by Captain Wei Zhenjiang, went to the Lugangdian area of our Sixth District to loot grain. The joint district team cooperated with the county brigade to completely annihilate them, with only three survivors escaping. They seized over 20 rifles and thousands of rounds of ammunition. On the 22nd, two companies of the 380th Regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's Sichuan Army, along with the town teams of Shangzhongkongzhen and two other towns, totaling about 500 men, invaded the Shangbenji area in the northern part of the Seventh District of Changyuan and the southern part of the Seventh District of Jun County, looting livestock. Upon learning of this, our joint defense district team immediately divided into three routes and engaged the enemy in guerrilla warfare. After about two hours, the enemy was repelled, and a four-wheeled cart and two livestock were seized and returned to the affected masses.
