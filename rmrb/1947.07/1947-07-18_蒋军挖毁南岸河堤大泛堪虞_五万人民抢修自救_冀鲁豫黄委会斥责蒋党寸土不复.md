Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 16th – 50,000 people from the southern bank of the Yellow River in Yun (cheng), Juan (cheng), and Shou (zhang) counties are working day and night to repair the river堤s destroyed by Chiang's troops. According to the person in charge of the Ji-Lu-Yu Yellow River Commission, on the second day of the recapture of Yuncheng, the county organized 10,000 people to carry out repairs, and is rushing to transport a large number of sorghum stalks, iron wires, etc., and plans to offer 6,000 large carts of stones for repairing the dam. As the great flood is approaching, it is necessary to first repair the dangerous works, and then repair and raise the 堤 banks. It is expected that the first phase of the project will be preliminarily completed within ten days. The person in charge rebuked the shameless lie of Chiang Kai-shek's Central News Agency, which repeatedly claimed to have restored the 堤s, stating: Taking the 60-li 堤 bank from Dasuzhuang to Dacheji in Changyuan, which is occupied by Chiang's troops, as an example, the Chiang side has never recovered an inch of land, but on the contrary, they have dug a fortification every 50 meters on the section of the 堤, and built a bunker every two to five li. In Menggang Village, Changyuan, there are six trenches, five feet deep and eight feet wide, dug on the bank of the 堤. Not only that, on June 12, Chiang's troops twice dispersed 6,000 workers who were restoring the 堤 in Changyuan, and killed more than 50 old people from Yu's family village and other villages who were restoring the 堤. In the section from Pingyin to Dong'e on the north bank, from June 15 to now, American-made Chiang planes have bombed and injured more than 80 people who were restoring the 堤. In Batou alone, 25 people were killed or injured in one incident, and bloodstains are still visible. How can Chiang's bandits quibble? Finally, the person in charge said with a gratified tone: General Liu Bocheng's army crossed the river to the south, and most of the southern bank of the Yellow River has been recovered. The great disaster for the people has been eliminated, and the people can restore the 堤 and save themselves.

    蒋军挖毁南岸河堤大泛堪虞
    五万人民抢修自救
    冀鲁豫黄委会斥责蒋党寸土不复
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十六日电】郓（城）鄄（城）寿（张）等县黄河南岸五万人民，已在日夜抢修被蒋军破坏之河堤。据冀鲁豫黄委会负责人对记者谈称：郓城收复之第二日，该县即组织了一万人进行抢修，正在赶运大批高粱秸、铁丝等，并拟献修坝石头六千大车。大泛眼看将到，必须首先抢修险工，然后修补和加高堤岸。预计十日内，第一期工程即可初步完成。负责人斥责蒋记中央社一再自称复堤的无耻谎言称：以蒋军所占领之长垣大苏庄到大车集六十里之堤岸为例，蒋方从未复过一寸土，而相反却在该段大堤上每隔五十公尺挖一道工事，每二至五里修一碉堡，长垣段孟岗村岸堤上即挖有五尺深八尺宽之壕沟六道。不但如此，六月十二日蒋军先后两次驱散在长垣段复堤之六千工人，杀死余家等村复堤老百姓五十余名。在北岸平阴至东阿段，自六月十五日迄今，美制蒋机曾炸死炸伤复堤群众八十余人，另在霸头一地，一次即死伤二十五人，至今血迹犹存，蒋贼怎能狡辩？最后该负责人以欣慰的口吻说：刘伯承将军大军南渡，黄河南岸大部光复，老百姓大害已除，人民得以复堤自救了。
