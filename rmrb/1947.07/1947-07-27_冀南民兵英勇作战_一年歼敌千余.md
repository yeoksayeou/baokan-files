	Jinnan Militia Valiantly Fight
	Annihilating Over a Thousand Enemies in a Year

	In the Patriotic Self-Defense War and land reform in Jinnan, the militia has further developed and grown stronger. According to incomplete statistics from last year, the entire region has reached 200,000 people. They not only protect the interests of the emancipated peasants in the rear, but also achieved great results in combat. After the Chiang army invaded our liberated areas, the call for resisting Chiang and protecting the land rose up in the militia, and countless village militias rushed to join the battle. From July of last year to June of this year, the number of people from various counties who went to the battlefield reached 460,000. In combat, they were incomparably brave. More than 3,000 militiamen in Wei County (Xin County, southwest of Daming) quickly moved behind enemy lines when the Chiang army occupied Huilong (southwest of Daming) and Daming, launching sparrow warfare, sniper warfare, and landmine warfare, and creating a combination of the above three tactics, making the enemy beaten everywhere, stepping on mines at every step, and daring not move forward easily. On January 7, they surrounded strongholds such as Huaying, Huangzhuang, Daxinzhuang, and @Jing, and cut more than 40 miles of telephone lines. In 49 days, the militia of that county killed, wounded, and captured more than 150 die-hard puppet captains and below, captured two bunkers, and cooperated with the regular army to annihilate a battalion of enemy troops in Shuangmiao (northeast of Huilong). The militia of the entire Daming County, using small districts as units, attacked the enemy, sometimes deep into the suburbs, ambushing small groups of enemies going out, and capturing the home-returning corps. In a blocking battle in Qianghoutun, landmines exploded, wounding more than a dozen enemies. The Yuanchao River Protection Brigade repelled seven enemy attacks in two days. And one night, they crossed the Wei River by force and annihilated a squad of the enemy. The militia of nine counties in the Fourth Military Sub-district, while training and fighting in the border areas, learned how to throw grenades and shoot, and defeated a company of enemies in Shimen. More than 200 villages in the Second Military Sub-district launched an explosion campaign, and in cooperation with the regular corps in Pingyuan, Gaotang, and Xiajin, captured more than a dozen strongholds, liberating vast areas within Gaotang, Xiajin, Pingyuan, Enxian, and Yucheng. More than 60 villagers near Yongnian City launched explosions, besieged the iron (Xu Ni Tieying) bandits in the city, and炸死炸伤(killed and wounded in the explosion) more than 40 enemies. And around the city, they built ground bunkers and underground bunkers on the dam, and the landmine array on the dam, like a dragon, besieged the enemy in the city. Their heroic battles over the past year have achieved brilliant results. According to incomplete statistics, in the first half of this year (excluding the Third and Fourth Military Sub-districts), they fought a total of 619 times, capturing 10 pillboxes, killing, wounding, and capturing 1,084 enemy puppet regiment leaders and below, seizing 17 machine guns, 596 rifles and carbines, 54 pistols, 3 grenade launchers, 13,309 rounds of various bullets, 287 various shells, 21 heads of livestock, 11,838 catties of grain, 491,000 yuan in legal tender, 59 silver dollars, 3 telephones, 10 bicycles, 400 catties of charcoal, 1,000 catties of pig iron, destroyed 110 miles of highways, uprooted 25 telephone poles, and cut 1,100 catties of telephone wires. Destroyed one bridge and broke two or seven railway tracks. This powerful peasant armed force, full of confidence in victory, is preparing to participate in the great counter-offensive and southern expedition to punish Chiang.
