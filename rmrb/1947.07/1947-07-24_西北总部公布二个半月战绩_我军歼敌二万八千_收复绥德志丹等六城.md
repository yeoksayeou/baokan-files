Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 22nd: The Northwest People's Liberation Army Headquarters announced the results of the two and a half months of self-defense war since the Chiang army's offensive against northern Shaanxi on March 13th until June 30th as follows: Killed and wounded 13,856 Chiang soldiers including He Qi (killed in action), the commander of the 48th Brigade of the 17th Division; captured alive 14,750 people including Li Kun'gang, commander of the 167th Brigade of the 1st Division, Li Jiyun, commander of the 31st Brigade of the 17th Division, and Mai Zongyu, commander of the 35th Brigade of the 151st Division; recovered six county towns - Suide, Zhidan, Huanxian, Anbian, Dingbian, Yanchi; once recovered four county towns - Heshui, Quzi, Gouyi, Anse; also once liberated Yaoxian city; shot down five Chiang planes; seized 132 artillery pieces of various calibers, four rocket launchers, 550 light and heavy machine guns, 399 Sten submachine guns, 7,929 long and short guns, 15 radio stations, 14 cars, more than 2,900 mules and horses, and countless other military supplies.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 22nd: The Meng-Han Detachment of the People's Armed Forces in Chengchuan (60 li northwest of Jingbian, a joint autonomous region of Mongolia and Han), Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, on the 17th, defeated the invading Ik Zhao League West Uxin Banner, the lackeys of Fu (Zuoyi) and Ma (Hongkui), the Mongol traitor Qiao Dalai's mounted bandits, killing or wounding more than 150 bandits, killing or wounding 11 bandits. In addition, a US-made Chiang plane strafed the Ning Tiao Liang area, 20 li northwest of Jingbian, on the 15th, and was damaged by the People's Armed Forces and fled.

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 20th: The citizens of Dingbian city, which was regained, were overjoyed. The whole city was filled with gongs and drums, shadow plays and yangko teams were active everywhere. The citizens, dressed in neat clothes, smiled and crowded the streets in the city center. On both sides of the West Main Street of the Drum Tower, a large number of various light and heavy weapons and victory items seized by the Northwest People's Liberation Army were displayed. In front of a heavy mortar, artillery commander Zhang Jingxiang held the sight and explained the performance of the gun to the audience, and explained that this gun was obtained in the Yangma River battle. He and the gunners also came from Hu Zongnan's army, completely original people and original guns, but the muzzle was turned to aim at Hu Zongnan. Mrs. Liu from the South Alley of the Drum Tower had been worried about her daughter's marriage for a long time. Who would dare to hold a wedding when the Ma bandits occupied the city? But as soon as the People's Liberation Army arrived, she immediately found her in-laws to discuss it, and sent her daughter off to marry on the third day after the liberation of Dingbian City. On the 5th and 6th, there was a general rain in the suburbs. The old farmer Gao Laohan stroked his beard and said with a smile: "No rain fell after the Ma bandits came, and the crops died of drought. As soon as the Eighth Route Army came, it brought the rain as well." Gen Jiu, the old man's nine-year-old grandson, interjected: "That's right, even the heavens don't love Ma Hongkui!"

Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 21st: The masses in Yan'an County launched a struggle against "encirclement and suppression" with the slogan "No one is captured, no materials are supplied to the enemy." Starting at the beginning of this month, the 48th and 84th Brigades of the Chiang army respectively窜扰 from the Hezhuang area of Yan'an and the Xujiagou area of Anse, attempting to encircle and "suppress" the Fengfu, Mudan, and Panlong districts of Yan'an County. The cadres of the democratic government in each district and township immediately cooperated with the masses to thoroughly strengthen the defenses, and organized more than 10,000 people into several brigades by village, making planned collective transfers, so that the enemy found nothing everywhere. The young farmers who were transferred out also cooperated with the guerrillas to go deep behind enemy lines and attack the enemies who were抢麦 (robbing wheat). The old men and children helped the masses in the areas close to the enemy to rush to harvest and hoe.
