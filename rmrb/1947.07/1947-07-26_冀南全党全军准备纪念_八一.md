Jinnan Party and Army Prepare to Commemorate "August 1st"

[This newspaper Jinnan 20th dispatch] To victoriously welcome the great counter-offensive, the Jinnan Party and Army are intensely preparing to commemorate "August 1st". The military region is preparing to hold widespread symposiums before "August 1st" to study Chairman Mao's military building thought, taking the study of Chairman Mao's thought as an important guarantee for winning the counter-offensive victory, and to greet the Red Army's birthday with a counter-offensive merit-making movement. The half-month before and after "August 1st" will be a congratulatory period. Each unit will hold congratulatory conferences. Each unit will also organize a propaganda team to publicize to the masses. The District Party Committee calls on the masses of the entire district to greet "August 1st" by supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, raising ideological awareness, implementing land reform, and carrying out the production movement. The Wei County Party Committee guarantees to do three things for the families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs: "No land left uncultivated, no operas performed, and three weedings of the seedlings." It mobilizes writing letters to the soldiers, reporting on the situation at home.
