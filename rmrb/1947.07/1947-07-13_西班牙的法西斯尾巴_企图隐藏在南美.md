Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 8th: TASS reports: Under the influence of reactionary forces in the United States, Argentina has recently been closely colluding with Fascist Spain. Ignoring its obligations to the United Nations (note: Argentina is a member of the United Nations, and the General Assembly has passed a resolution prohibiting maintaining diplomatic relations with Spain), its president, Perón, recently even dispatched his wife to visit Fascist Spain, touting for the unstable Franco dictatorship. The Soviet magazine *New Times* pointed out in this regard: Franco is obviously trying to hide Spain's international isolation behind Mrs. Perón's shawl. It is also reported that Spain has recently sent a large number of fascist secret agents to various South American countries. According to the Mexican weekly *Occidente*: The notorious Spanish "Falange" secret agents Overtilo and Zuniega arrived in South America several months ago and are posing as "lecturers" at the Catholic University of Colombia. Recently, Venezuela and Mexico have also seen a large number of Falange secret agents stepping up their pro-fascist propaganda.

    西班牙的法西斯尾巴
    企图隐藏在南美
    【新华社陕北八日电】塔斯社讯：在美国反动势力影响下，阿根廷近来与法西斯西班牙有密切之勾搭。该国总统斐伦不顾该国对联合国之义务（按阿根廷为联合国会员国之一，而联大曾通过禁止与西班牙保持使节来往的决议）。最近竟派遣其夫人访问法西斯西班牙，为不稳的佛朗哥独裁统治招摇张目。苏时代杂志对此指出：佛朗哥显然想把西班牙在国际上的孤立藏在斐伦夫人的披肩后面。另悉西班牙最近派了大批法西斯特务分子至南美各国活动，据墨西哥“西美周刊”载称：臭名远扬的西班牙“长枪党”特务奥维蒂洛、祖尼格巴于数月前抵南美，在哥伦比亚天主教大学里冒充“讲师”。委内瑞拉、墨西哥近亦到有大批长枪党特务加紧进行其亲法西斯的宣传。
