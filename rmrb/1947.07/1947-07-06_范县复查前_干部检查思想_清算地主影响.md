(Jilu Yu Daily News, 4th dispatch) Before the review in Fan County, at a meeting of activists, many cadres conducted deep self-reflection in their thinking for the sake of a more thorough review in the future. After this self-reflection, their class stance became much clearer. In particular, comrades from landlord backgrounds deeply felt that they had lost their stance in the past and were unable to see problems from the perspective of the masses and serve the masses well. Comrade Wang ××, the head of the × district, had a relatively good understanding of his shortcomings.

Wang's father's family was a landlord when he was young, but by the time he grew up, the family had declined and become a rich peasant family employing laborers. Before the land reform, the family had six people and forty mu of land. Wang has been working in the revolution for more than eight years, serving as director of the district farmers' association, director of the Anti-Japanese Association, director of the county farmers' association, and district head. In the early stages of the land reform movement, when Chiang's troops were pressing in, he thought, "The masses are afraid of 'the sky changing,' who would dare to take land!" But since the district opened a poor peasant association and the masses really rose up to take land from the landlords, he realized that land distribution was what the masses wanted. However, after the masses had just divided the land, he felt that it was "almost enough," believing that "if the landlords are enlightened, land reform can be completed well in four or five days."

Later, when the higher authorities proposed "settling accounts with landlords and investigating hidden wealth," he thought, "Will landlords be able to live at all like this?" Although he thought so at the time, he had to carry out the instructions, so he verbally forced himself to overcome his pity for the landlords and reluctantly deployed the task. Initially, when he first encountered the killing of two heinous landlords, he was unwilling to kill them, fearing that he would make two enemies, and later killed them only under duress. When it came to the general review, his thinking became even more blocked. This was mainly because it was connected to his relatives and his own family, who were all rich peasants or landlords, so pulling threads would end up in his own front door! He thought, "Isn't this going to kill the landlords?" "If it's not thorough once, and not thorough twice, does it mean we have to pull threads every time to be considered thorough?" At this time, he resented the higher authorities for not giving a clear standard. But he was also afraid that if the struggle was not thorough enough, the higher authorities would hold him responsible. He also thought of his eight years of work history and that he couldn't afford to fall. Therefore, he put aside his landlord and rich peasant relatives and family, and still carried out the instructions of the higher authorities, serving the masses and continuing to work. But when it really came to his personal family, he felt uncomfortable again. He said, "My older brother, Wang Jinsheng (a landlord, who lives separately from Wang), came to me during the review, asking to join the work to escape the struggle against him by the masses in the village. At that time, I considered introducing him to work at the People's Hospital." When landlords were gathered in the county for self-reflection, he immediately thought about "my father, who is so old... does he have to go too?" He wanted to talk to the county magistrate and the county secretary, but was afraid of being criticized and didn't dare to raise the issue. Therefore, he was restless for several days, and didn't even want to eat. Once, he didn't sleep all night. During the review movement, he said, "I have always been behind the mass movement, failing to play a leading role. I am hard-mouthed but soft-hearted towards landlords, right-leaning, but it has also made me deeply experience the impact of my class background on myself. At the same time, through long-term struggles in my thinking during the mass movement, my class stance has become clearer!"

Comrade Wang ×× expressed his future attitude and determination, saying: "My personal family is rich peasant and landlord, and should be completely handed over to the masses for handling, and I will never interfere. I will also educate my family not to be special in any way, and ask the masses to take care of them. In the thorough review, I am determined to perform meritorious service for the people in order to correct my past mistakes."

(Another dispatch) At a recent district cadre meeting in Shou Zhang's first district, the cadres' thinking was examined. The co-director was used as a model to examine that in the past, there were many places where his stance was vague and exploited by landlords, and the cadres became shields for the landlords. This also inspired everyone to examine their own stances, and each cadre took a step forward in their thinking, laying the foundation for a deeper step in the review movement in the future.

(Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 28th dispatch) After the "Wang Rong Battalion" of the Jin-Cha-Ji Field Army launched the land reform study movement, each unit immediately held large classes at the battalion level, conducted informal talks in platoons and squads, and held branch meetings and various types of discussion meetings involving Party members and non-Party members with landlord, rich peasant, poor peasant, and farm laborer backgrounds, which were warmly discussed. Among them, the accusation meetings of the "Great Wall Unit" and the "Yangtze River Unit" were the most effective. In his typical report, Zeng Jiu Hai reported that his land was surrounded by the local tyrant's land, and it was encroached upon year after year until it was completely gone, forcing his father to jump into a well and his mother to die of illness. His older brother was arrested and it cost 1,500 yuan in fake banknotes and five dou of grain to get him out. Wang Xiao Luan of the Sixth Company said, "I borrowed fifty yuan from a rich man and worked as a farmhand for three years without paying it off, and he drove me and my mother to the temple, and my mother was forced to death." Comrades from landlord backgrounds also deeply reflected on themselves. A newly liberated soldier from the Third Company said, "Returning land to the farmers is completely justified. My family is an exploiting class, with 105 mu of land and 23 beehives. It should all be distributed to the peasants." After this enthusiastic recollection and accusation movement, the troops' class consciousness was greatly enhanced, and they unanimously swore to fight to the end to defend the land and kill the enemy.

### 范县复查前　干部检查思想　清算地主影响

　　范县复查前
  　干部检查思想
  　清算地主影响
    【本报冀鲁豫四日电】范县活动分子会上，为今后深入复查，许多干部，都作了深刻的思想反省，经思想反省后，大大明确了阶级立场，特别是地主出身的同志，深刻感到过去丧失立场，不能很好的从群众这一方面看问题，为群众服务。×区区长王××同志对自己的缺点认识得较好。
    王父亲青年时，家庭是地主成份，至他长大后，家庭已破落，成为只雇有雇工的富农，土地改革前家有六口人，四十亩地。王参加革命工作已八年多，曾任区农会主任、抗联主任、县农会主任、区长等职。土地改革运动初期，当时蒋军压境，他认为“群众怕‘变天’谁敢要地！”但自从区里开了贫农会，群众真起来向地主动手要地了，自己才知道分田是群众要求；可是在群众刚起来分了土地，自己又感觉“差不多”了，“地主开明，土地改革好完成，四、五天就可完成。”
    后来，上级提出：“向地主清算、清查浮财”，他想：“这样还有地主过的吗？”当时思想上虽然如此，又不得不执行指示，所以就口头上硬克服对地主的怜悯思想，勉强布置下去，当初次遇到杀两个罪大恶极的地主时，不愿杀，心里怕，怕落两家仇人，后来杀了，也是被迫而杀的。进入大复查时，他的思想就更不通了。主要是已联系到自己的亲戚与自己的家庭，他们都是富农或地主，如拉滑子，拉来拉去就拉到个人大门里了！认为：“这不是要地主的命吗？”“一次不彻底，二次不彻底，是否都拉拉滑子，才算彻底呢？”这时瞒怨上级不给个尺码。但又怕斗不透，上级要追责任；又想到自己八年来的工作历史，不能垮下去。因此就摆开了地主富农的亲戚、家庭，还是执行上级指示，为群众服务干下去。但在真临到个人家庭时，又感觉不通了，他说：“我的哥哥王金生（地主，与王分居了），在复查时，跑来找我，要求参加工作，以逃避村里群众对他的斗争，当时我就考虑到把他介绍人民医院去工作。”在县里集合地主反省时，马上又考虑到“自己的父亲，那样大年纪了………是否要去呢？”想找县长，县书谈谈，又怕受批评，不敢提出。因此，几天坐卧不安，也不愿吃饭，有次一夜也没睡觉。在复查运动中，他说：“一直是在群众运动后面，未能起领导作用，对地主是口硬心软，右倾，但也使自己深刻的体验到，成份出身对自己的作用。同时，在群众运动中，自己思想上经过长期的斗争，使自己的阶级立场，明确起来！”
    王××同志表明今后的态度与决心说：“个人的家庭是富农地主，应当完全交群众处理，决不干涉，并教育家庭丝毫不能特殊，叫群众照顾。在深入复查中，决心为人民立功，以纠正自己过去的错误。”
    【又电】寿张最近一区区干部会上，检查了一下干部思想，以联合主任作典型，检查出过去有许多地方，立场模糊，被地主所钻空，干部成为地主的挡箭牌，这样也启发了大家对自己立场的检查，每个干部在思想上提高了一步，奠定了今后复查运动深入一步的基础。
    【新华社晋察冀二十八日电】晋察冀野战军“王容营”部土地改革学习运动展开后，各部队当即以营为单位上大课，在班排中进行漫谈，并召开支部大会及地主、富农、贫农、雇农成份的党员与非党同志等各种类型的座谈会，热烈讨论，其中以“长城部”“长江部”的诉苦大会收效最大。在典型报告中，曾就海报告了自己的水地被老财的地包围，一年一年的被侵占完了，逼的爹跳井、娘病死，哥哥被抓走，花一千五百元伪钞票，五斗粮才保出来。六连王小乱说：“借财主五十块钱，当了三年长工没还清，把我和娘赶到庙里，娘被逼死了。”地主出身的同志也都深刻反省，三连新解放战士说：“土地还家完全应当，我家就是个剥削阶级，有土地一○五亩，有密蜂廿三窝，应全部分给农民。”经过这种热烈的回忆诉苦运动，部队的阶级觉悟大为提高，一致宣誓要为保田杀敌战斗到底。
