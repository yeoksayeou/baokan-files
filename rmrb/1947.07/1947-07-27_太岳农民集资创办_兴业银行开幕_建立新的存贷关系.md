[Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 24th] The "Prosperity Bank," Taiyue's first bank established by liberated farmers pooling their funds, officially opened in Yangcheng on the morning of the 16th of this month, with capital reaching over 18 million yuan. In Yangcheng County, due to the realization of "land to the tiller" and the organized development of production to achieve prosperity, rural productivity has greatly increased, and farmers' savings have gradually increased as well. There is a demand to establish new deposit and loan relationships to adjust surpluses and shortages and expand reproduction. Thus, initiated and organized by the liberated farmers in Chengguan, this newest type of private bank, self-managed by the farmers, was established. At first, upon hearing that the suffering people were also going to open a bank, the water-selling old man, Wang Geta, was overjoyed and said, "I also want to be a shareholder!" and took his 1,000 yuan earned from selling water to buy shares. Zhang Jiashen, a hero in indigo planting, invested 150,000 yuan alone. The Jixing mutual aid group of Ma Fuxin, and the farmers' carrying teams from more than ten villages, including Shangyao, and then the coal workers of Houze Yao, Si, and other porcelain kilns, all took their surplus money to buy shares. In just a few days, the liberated masses in Yangcheng Chengguan alone had invested 11 million yuan. The farmer activists responsible for preparing for the establishment of the bank became even more confident and announced three major guarantees on the day of the opening: first, investment will definitely receive dividends; second, a fixed half-interest dividend will be paid per share each month; and third, investors have priority in obtaining loans, and what is said will be done. Wang Qilian, a liberated farmer from Shangcun, only had 1,500 yuan in funds, but because he had an urgent need, he borrowed 15,000 yuan from the bank on the 16th to take care of things. He was very happy and told everyone he met, "In the future, any money I earn will be deposited in the bank."

　　太岳农民集资创办
  　兴业银行开幕
  　建立新的存贷关系
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫廿四日电】太岳第一个翻身农民集资创办的“兴业银行”，已于本月十六日晨在阳城正式开幕，资金达一千八百余万元。阳城县由于实现了耕者有其田及组织起来发家致富的生产方向，农村生产力大大提高，农民的积蓄也逐渐增多，要求建立新的存贷关系，调剂有无扩大再生产。于是在城关翻身农民发起组织下，这个最新型的农民自手经营的私立银行成立起来了。开头一听到受苦人也要开银行啦，卖水老汉王圪塔高兴得什么似的说：“我也要当个股东！”把卖水得来的一千块钱拿去入股。种蓝英雄张甲申一人投资十五万，马福心的集兴互助组，还有上窑等十余村的农民担挑队，后则腰、四等磁窑工人都纷纷拿余钱去入股。不多几天，光阳城城关镇的翻身群众所投的资金就有一千一百万块钱了。负责筹备成立银行的农民积极分子，信心越发提高了，当开幕那一天，就宣布了三大保证：第一、投资一定能分红；第二、每月每股固定的分半息；第三、投资人有贷款优先权，并且说到做到；上村翻身农民王起炼资金才一千五百元，因有急用，十六日那天就向银行贷了一万五千块钱，把事情办了，他非常高兴，逢人就说：“往后赚了钱，都要放到银行里去。”
