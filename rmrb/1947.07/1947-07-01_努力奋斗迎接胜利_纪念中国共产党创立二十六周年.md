　　In the midst of fierce artillery fire, our people commemorate the 26th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, the leader of their liberation movement. Together with the people of the whole country, the Communist Party of China has experienced the first Great Revolution, the Land Revolution, and the War of Resistance Against Japan, and is now undergoing another patriotic self-defense war for independence, democracy, and peace.

　　Because the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, supported by American imperialists, persists in its policy of selling out the country, pursuing civil war, and dictatorship, the independence of the motherland has been betrayed, and the people are facing unprecedented war, terror, and starvation. The desires of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries are limitless; he wants all the Chinese people to be slaves of American imperialism and the four families of Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen. To this end, he does not hesitate to tear up all promises, does not hesitate to sell out the motherland, does not hesitate to use artillery fire to destroy the happy lives of the people in the liberated areas, does not hesitate to use secret agent terror to deal with students and democrats, does not hesitate to force millions of troops to die on the battlefield, and does not hesitate to let millions and tens of millions of people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas starve to death. The towering crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries have forced the people of the whole country to unite, resolutely embark on the road of patriotic self-defense war, and embark on the struggle against hunger, civil war, and dictatorship to save themselves from death and seek survival. We have a great national united front, which includes workers, peasants, intellectuals, petty bourgeois, patriotic national capitalists, enlightened gentry, ethnic minorities, and overseas Chinese; this is the mass of the Chinese people. Today, the mass of the people of the whole country is engaged in a great, just, and glorious struggle. The independence of the motherland and the democratic liberation of the people have not yet been completed and still await the bloodshed and sweat of our people to achieve.

　　However, on the other hand, today is very different from the past. In the face of fierce enemies, the people of the whole country have never despised the enemy as much as they do today in the past twenty-six years, are confident that their struggle will be victorious, and are confident that this victory will surely come soon; the myth that the so-called reactionaries cannot be defeated has long been abandoned by the people. Another argument, namely, the so-called "The government army certainly cannot eliminate the People's Liberation Army, but the People's Liberation Army also cannot completely break the government army's offensive, and the result will be a stalemate," is the argument of the centrists. This argument is also being rapidly abandoned by the people. The people of the whole country increasingly believe that the reactionaries will never be able to eliminate the People's Liberation Army, but the People's Liberation Army will certainly be able to completely crush the offensive of the reactionaries. This is because: First, the current struggle is a life-and-death决斗 between the Chinese reactionaries and the Chinese people; second, the current international and domestic situation is favorable to the Chinese people; third, the Communist Party of China has become a great, mature, and experienced party in the course of twenty-six years of training, and has full confidence in leading the people to crush all the offensives of the reactionaries and achieve final victory.

　　The international situation after World War II is conducive to the liberation of the Chinese people. American imperialism is more powerful, more ferocious, and more hypocritical than Japanese imperialism; this is one aspect. But on the other hand, the new conditions after World War II have made American imperialism's aggression against China encounter unprecedented difficulties. In the capitalist world, almost two years after the end of the war, there is still no sign of economic stability. The lives of the people in capitalist countries have not improved after the war but continue to deteriorate. The American economic crisis is about to arrive; the reactionaries of all countries in the world are directly and indirectly supported by American imperialism. American imperialism attempts to single-handedly support the corrupt reactionary forces of all countries in the world to oppose the people, but it is difficult to solve the difficulties of these reactionaries, and it is also difficult to support them for a long time. The American bourgeoisie has split into the Wallace faction; the two major bourgeois parties, the Democrats and Republicans, restrict each other due to the presidential race; and within the big bourgeoisie, there are differences over the specific policies on how to expand, first of all on the Soviet issue. On the other hand, there are the achievements of the economic recovery and economic construction of the socialist Soviet Union, the growing consolidation of the newly emerging democratic countries, the increasing awareness of the people in capitalist countries, the struggle of colonies and colonial peoples for independence and freedom, and the opposition of the American people to the reactionary policies of American imperialists. This situation not only makes the "U.S.-Soviet war" dreamed of by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries a bubble but also because the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries are now extremely corrupt, American imperialism's assistance to Chiang Kai-shek cannot save Chiang Kai-shek from death.

　　In terms of the domestic situation, because Chiang Kai-shek's tyranny exceeds any traitor and dictator in the past, exceeding Wang Jingwei and Yuan Shikai, the people of all strata in China have risen up to oppose him more widely than at any time in the past, the strength of the people is stronger than at any time in the past, and the crisis encountered by Chiang Kai-shek is more profound and serious than the crisis encountered by any traitor and dictator in history during his rule. Chiang Kai-shek tore up the Double Tenth Agreement, the Four Pledges, the Ceasefire Agreement, and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, launched a nationwide civil war, convened a bogus National Assembly, formulated a bogus constitution, signed a traitorous Sino-U.S. Commercial Treaty, colluded with foreign troops to station on Chinese territory, borrowed heavily from the United States, used a large amount of military supplies sent by the United States, expelled the representatives of the Communist Party of China, occupied Yan'an, severely suppressed students who wanted food, peace, and freedom, closed down liberal newspapers, used arrests and assassinations to deal with the vast number of democrats, and employed the Japanese war criminal Neiji Okamura to participate in the command of the civil war. Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous policy, civil war policy, and dictatorial policy have created Chiang Kai-shek's own political crisis, military crisis, and economic crisis. Chiang Kai-shek's offensive against the liberated areas has not only failed to eliminate the People's Liberation Army but also has not weakened the People's Liberation Army; on the contrary, it has greatly tempered and strengthened the People's Liberation Army, making the People's Liberation Army stronger than ever before, and it continues to become stronger, and the equipment and tactics of the People's Liberation Army have been greatly improved. Chiang Kai-shek's offensive against students and the masses of people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas has also yielded the same result, not only failing to eliminate or weaken the democratic movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas but instead making it more developed and more powerful. Chiang Kai-shek's offensive on two fronts has suffered defeat and will suffer even greater defeat. In just one year of war, Chiang Kai-shek's regular army has been annihilated by nearly one hundred brigades (only those annihilated in whole battalions, whole regiments, whole brigades, and whole divisions are counted, while those annihilated below the whole battalion and the large number of annihilated puppet troops, police, and security teams are not counted). This is the most important indicator of the changing situation. Since the People's Liberation Army was able to annihilate nearly one hundred brigades of Chiang's army in the past year without relying on any foreign aid and with its own efforts; then, in the future patriotic war, the People's Liberation Army has no reason not to rely on its own efforts to completely, thoroughly, and cleanly annihilate all of Chiang Kai-shek's invading armies. This invading army, including those already annihilated, has a total of two hundred and forty-eight brigades to date, of which two hundred and eighteen brigades are attacking our Central China, North China, Northeast, and Northwest liberated areas, eight brigades are attacking the Hunan-Hubei and South China guerrilla areas, and only twenty-two brigades are guarding the rear of the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Therefore, the annihilation of all of Chiang Kai-shek's invading armies is equivalent to the demise of Chiang Kai-shek.

　　This is why the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries can never conquer the people, and the people will surely be able to defeat the reactionaries; this is why the independence of the Chinese nation and the democratic liberation of the people must be victorious, and although there is still a difficult road ahead when this victory comes, it will not be far away. The Communist Party of China has demonstrated its loyalty to the cause of the people's liberation in the past three revolutionary movements and has been able to guide this liberation movement to victory. In this patriotic self-defense war, the Communist Party of China is being tested for the fourth time. On the issue of war, the Communist Party of China is leading the People's Liberation Army to smoothly complete the transition from large-scale guerrilla warfare during the Anti-Japanese War to large-scale regular warfare, which has laid the foundation for the success of the motherland's independence and the people's liberation movement. Another issue of paramount importance is to thoroughly resolve the land issue in the vast liberated areas with a population of 140 million, and the completion of this task has given the liberated areas an inexhaustible source of political, military, and economic strength to defeat the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, who own all the major cities and receive a large amount of assistance from American imperialism. The reason why these two tasks have been solved so smoothly is that the Communist Party of China, after more than twenty years of training and through the rectification movement of the whole party, has become a politically mature party, strongly united under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people. With such a party, our motherland's independence and the people's liberation cause have a definite hope, and this hope makes our people more firm in their confidence and courage.

　　The people of the motherland have clearly seen the prospects for their victory; this victory will be nothing else but the realization of the goals of the Chinese patriots who have shed their blood and sacrificed their lives for more than a century, that is, the realization of the motherland's independence and democracy, and the realization of Sun Yat-sen's wishes. The conditions for victory are already in place, and there will still be difficulties on the road ahead. We must face these difficulties squarely, rather make long-term plans, and not have a quick-win mentality; but no matter what difficulties, we must overcome them, and we can certainly overcome them. Compatriots, Comrades: Advance bravely, work hard, and welcome victory! We dare to win, and we will surely win!

### 努力奋斗迎接胜利　纪念中国共产党创立二十六周年

　　努力奋斗迎接胜利
  　纪念中国共产党创立二十六周年
    在激烈的炮火声中，我国人民纪念自己的解放运动的领导者中国共产党创立的二十六周年。中国共产党与全国人民一起已经经历了第一次大革命、土地革命和抗日战争三个伟大的革命运动，现在正在经历着另外一次为独立为民主为和平而奋斗的爱国自卫战争。
    由于蒋介石反动集团在美国帝国主义者支持之下坚持其卖国内战独裁的政策，祖国的独立被出卖了，人民遇到空前未有的战祸、恐怖和饥饿。蒋介石反动派的欲望是无限的，他要全中国人民都做美国帝国主义与蒋宋孔陈四大家族的奴隶。为此目的，不惜撕毁一切诺言，不惜出卖祖国，不惜用炮火毁灭解放区人民的幸福生活，不惜以特务恐怖对付学生和民主人士，不惜强迫几百万军队到战场上去战死，不惜让几百万几千万蒋管区人民饿死。蒋介石反动派的滔天罪恶，迫得全国人民团结起来，坚决走上爱国自卫战争和走上救死求生的反饥饿反内战反独裁的斗争道路。我们有个伟大的民族统一战线，这个统一战线包括工人、农民、知识分子、小资产者、爱国的民族资本家、开明绅士、少数民族及海外华侨，这就是全中国的人民大众。今天全国人民大众正处在伟大、正义和光荣的斗争中，祖国的独立和人民的民主解放尚未完成，还有待于我们全国人民大众流血流汗去争取。
    但是，另一方面今天与过去有了大不相同之处，全国人民在凶恶的敌人面前，二十六年以来从来没有象今天一样藐视敌人，确信自己的奋斗一定会胜利，而且确信这个胜利必定在不久就要到来；所谓反动派不能战胜的神话早已被人民大众所唾弃。另外一种议论即所谓“政府军固然不能消灭人民解放军，但是人民解放军亦不能彻底打破政府军的进攻，结果会是相持局面”，这是中间派的论调。这种论调也正在迅速的被人民大众所唾弃。全国人民日益相信反动派是永远无法消灭人民解放军的，而人民解放军却一定能把反动派的进攻彻底粉碎。这是因为：第一，现在所进行的斗争乃是中国反动派与中国人民之间你死我活的决斗；第二，现在的国际形势与国内形势对中国人民有利；第三，中国共产党在二十六年的锻炼中已经成为伟大的成熟的老练的政党，有充分的把握领导人民粉碎反动派的一切进攻，并取得最后胜利。
    第二次世界大战以后的国际形势是对于中国人民的解放有利的，美国帝国主义比日本帝国主义更强大更凶恶和更虚伪，这是一方面；但另一方面，第二次世界大战后的新条件，使美国帝国主义的对华侵略遇到前所未有的困难。在资本主义世界里，战争结束快要两年，至今看不见会有经济稳定的到来。资本主义各国人民生活战后并没有改善，却在继续恶化之中。美国的经济危机不久就要到来；世界各国的反动派都由美国帝国主义直接间接的支持着，美国帝国主义企图一手支撑世界各国的腐烂的反动势力来反对人民，是决难解决这些反动派的困难，并且也决难长期支撑下去的。美国的资产阶级内部分裂出华莱士一派；民主、共和两个大资产阶级政党因争总统而互相制约；大资产阶级内部对于如何扩张的具体政策问题，首先是对苏问题也发生纷歧。另一方面，则是社会主义苏联的经济恢复与经济建设的成就，战后兴起的各新民主主义国家的日趋巩固，资本主义各国人民的日益觉悟，殖民地和殖民地人民要求独立自由的斗争，和美国人民对美国帝国主义者的反动政策的反对，这种情况就不但使蒋介石反动派所梦想的“美苏战争”成为泡影，并且因为蒋介石反动派现在腐败已极，美国帝国主义对于蒋介石的援助不能挽救蒋介石的死亡。
    就国内情况来说，因为蒋介石的暴政超过以往的任何卖国贼和独裁者，超过汪精卫和袁世凯，所以中国各阶层人民起来反对他的较之以往任何时候更为广泛，人民的力量较之以往任何时候更为强大，蒋介石所遭到的危机也比以往历史上任何卖国贼和独裁者在其统治时期所遭遇的危机来得更深刻更严重。蒋介石撕毁双十协定、四项诺言、停战协定和政协决议，发动全国大内战，召开伪国大，制定伪宪法，签订卖国的中美商约，勾结外国军队驻在中国领土，大借美债，大用美国送来的军火，驱逐中共代表，占领延安，对要饭吃要和平要自由的学生严厉镇压，封闭自由主义的报纸，以逮捕和暗杀对付广大民主人士，起用日本战犯冈村宁次参加指挥内战。蒋介石这种卖国政策内战政策和独裁政策，造成了蒋介石自己的政治危机军事危机与经济危机。蒋介石对解放区的进攻，不但没有消灭人民解放军，而且也没有削弱人民解放军；相反的，却大大的锻炼了和加强了人民解放军，使人民解放军强大到从来未有的程度，并且还在继续变得更加强大，人民解放军的装备和战术是大大提高了。蒋介石对蒋管区学生和人民大众的进攻，也得到同样的结果，不但不能消灭或削弱蒋管区的民主运动，反而使它更加发展，更加有力。蒋介石在两条战线上的进攻，都遭到失败，并且将要遭到更大的失败。蒋介石在仅仅一年的战争中，其正规军已经被歼近一百个旅（只算整营整团整旅整师被歼灭的，整营以下被歼灭者及伪军警察保安队被大量歼灭者均未算在内）。这是时局变化的最重要的指标。人民解放军既然能在过去一年中不依赖任何外援以自己的努力歼灭蒋军近一百个旅；那么，在今后的爱国战争中，人民解放军就没有任何理由不能依靠自己的努力全部彻底干净歼灭蒋介石的一切进犯军。这个进犯军连已被歼者计算在内，到现在为止，共有二百四十八个旅，其中进攻我华中、华北、东北、西北各解放区者为二百十八个旅，进攻湘鄂及华南游击区者为八个旅，守备蒋区后方的不过二十二个旅。所以蒋介石全部进犯军的被歼灭，即等于蒋介石的灭亡。
    这就是为什么蒋介石反动派是永远无法征服人民，而人民则一定能够战胜反动派的缘故；这就是为什么中华民族的独立与人民的民主解放必定要胜利，并且这个胜利到来的时候虽然还有一段艰难路程，但是已经不会很远的缘故。中国共产党已经在过去三次革命运动中表现他的忠实于人民的解放事业，并且能够引导这个解放运动走上胜利。在此次爱国自卫战争中，中国共产党第四次受到考验。在战争问题上，中国共产党领导着人民解放军顺利的完成着从抗日时期的大规模游击战争到现在的大规模的正规作战的转变，这就替祖国的独立和人民解放运动的成功奠定了基础。另一个有头等重要性的问题，就是在拥有一万万四千万人口的广大解放区里彻底解决土地问题，这一任务的完成，使解放区获得政治军事经济力量的无穷源泉来战胜拥有一切大城市和得到美国帝国主义大量援助的蒋介石反动派。这两个任务的所以如此顺利的得到解决，乃是因为中国共产党经过了二十余年的锻炼，经过全党的整风运动，已经是在伟大的中国人民领袖毛泽东同志领导之下，坚强团结起来的政治上完全成熟了的党。有了这样的党，我们祖国的独立和人民解放事业就有了确切的指望，这种指望使我国人民更加坚强了信心和勇气。
    祖国的人民已经清楚的看到自己的胜利的前景；这个胜利将不是别的，而是百余年来我国志士仁人抛头流血牺牲奋斗的目标的实现，就是祖国的独立与民主的实现，就是孙中山志愿的实现。胜利的条件已经具备了，前进的道路上还会有困难，我们一定要正视这些困难，宁可作长期打算，不要有速胜论；但是无论什么困难，我们一定要克服，也一定可以克服。同胞们、同志们：勇敢前进，努力奋斗，迎接胜利！我们敢于胜利，我们就一定胜利！
