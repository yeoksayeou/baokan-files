　　Jiang's Army Humor
　　"Looking for the Eighth Route Army in a Bottle"
　　 Gao Shuji
　　On April 5th, our troops passed by X Village in Tangyin. An old man, Wang Kun, who was about fifty or sixty years old, told us a funny story.
　　One night, I was sick in bed when a Central Army soldier came in. He was carrying a gun in one hand and a lamp in the other. Without saying a word, he turned the house upside down, searching every place. There was an oil bottle on the table, and he kept twisting it around in his hand. I asked him what he was looking for? That fellow glared at me and said, "It's none of your business! Looking for the Eighth Route Army!" Humph! It's really one of the rarest things in the world, can you hide a person in a bottle? I've lived for fifty or sixty years, not to mention I haven't seen it! I haven't even heard of it!... He twisted it for a long time, it turned out he wanted to pour out the half a catty of oil in the bottle!

　　蒋军的幽默
  　“瓶子里找八路”
    高树基
    四月五号，我们部队路过汤阴×村，一个五、六十岁的老汉，名叫王坤，给我们讲了一件笑人的事情。
    有一晚我病在炕上，来了个中央军，一手提枪，一手提灯，进了家里，一声不吭，翻箱倒柜，没有一个地方不翻的。桌子上放着个油瓶子，他拿在手里扭来扭去。我问他找啥？那个家伙瞪着眼说：“你管着！找八路！”哼！真是天下少有的事，瓶子里能藏人？我活了五、六十岁，不用说没看见过！听都没有听过！……他扭了好久，原来是想倒去瓶子里的半斤油！
