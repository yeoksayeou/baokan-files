    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 9th: The cadres of Chishui County in the Guanzhong sub-region of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia are united with the masses like flesh and blood, persisting in the struggle in their original locations. In the past two months, the democratic order in the entire county has been completely restored and is expanding outwards, establishing fourteen democratic village administrations in the nearby Chiang-controlled areas. In the struggle, the masses, with boundless enthusiasm and courage, cleverly shielded the cadres and guerrillas, helping them evade the enemy. County cadre Yao Wenzhi was arrested by the enemy near Shimen Pass. The wife of Zhu Yanfeng, a refugee from Henan, quickly threw herself in front of the enemy and said, "This is my man, why are you pulling him?" The enemy questioned, "Why do you two have different accents?" She said without hesitation, "My man died of illness, I hired this one locally." Finally, she rescued Yao Wenzhi from the jaws of the tiger. Fifth District cadre Mi Hezhen was hiding and working in a village. One afternoon, when he returned to the village, he unfortunately ran into the enemy. He casually grabbed a calf at the entrance of the village and calmly walked towards the village. An old man was standing at the door facing the street. When he saw Mi Hezhen, he scolded loudly, "Where have you been wandering? Why did it take you so long to bring the cow back?" Mi respectfully replied, "The calf runs very fast, I couldn't catch up." The old man then angrily ordered, "Take it back, go gather firewood quickly! You are so lazy." Mi Hezhen led the cow in, took the rope, and safely left the village, escaping danger.

    赤水群众以无限热情
    掩护干部与敌人周旋
    【新华社西北九日电】陕甘宁关中分区赤水县干部与群众血肉相联，坚持原地斗争。两月来全县境民主秩序已完全恢复并向外伸展，在附近蒋管区建立了十四个民主村政权。在斗争中，群众以无限的热情和勇敢，机智地掩护干部和游击队与敌周旋。县干部姚文治在石门关附近被敌逮捕，河南难民朱彦锋之妻赶紧扑到敌人面前说：“这是我的男人，你拉他干啥？”敌人质问：“你们俩的口音为什么不同？”她毫不迟疑的说：“我的男人病死了，这是我这里招下的。”终于从虎口救出了姚文治。五区干部米和真隐蔽在某村活动，一天下午回村时，不巧碰上了敌人，他顺手牵上村口一头小牛犊镇静的向村里走。一位老汉正站在靠街的门口，看见米和真就大骂：“你那里逛去来？那么久才把牛吆回来？”米尊敬地答道：“牛犊跑得很快，赶不上。”老汉又怒气冲冲地吩咐：吆回去，快拾柴去！真懒得要命。”米和真牵进牛，拿了绳子，安全出村脱险。
