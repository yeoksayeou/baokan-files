After the Jinnan Ninth Military Sub-district conveyed the spirit of land reform, cadres from the × Regiment who were from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds wrote letters one after another to persuade their families to return land to the masses and bow their heads in apology. Regiment Commander Han returned home twice to persuade his family. Comrade Zhu Chiting, an accountant, wrote letters both to the village cadres and to his family, turning over all property for distribution to the masses. Staff Director Zhang Ting personally returned home to take out the deeds and hand them over to the village cadres for the masses to handle. At first, because the new spirit had not yet been conveyed locally, the village cadres were somewhat bewildered. Director Zhang explained the new spirit conveyed by the troops to the village cadres, asking them to accept it and hand it over to the masses for handling, saying, "If the masses have any opinions about me, they can notify me, and if necessary, I will come back to apologize." The village cadres were unwilling to accept it, and Director Zhang said, "We train soldiers, fight battles, and shed blood desperately for the sake of the masses gaining land." (Pioneer News)

　　冀南九分区×团干部
  　写信说服家庭交出群众财物
    【本报讯】冀南九分区传达土地改革的精神后，×团地主、富农成份的干部纷纷写信说服家属，把土地归还群众向群众低头。韩团长两次回家说服家庭，会计朱池亭同志一面写信给村干一面给家庭，把全部财产交给群众分配，参谋主任张亭同志亲自回家把文契拿出来交给村干让群众处理。开始因地方尚未传达这个新精神，村干都有些莫明其妙，张主任就把部队传达的新精神，向村干说明，让他们收下交群众处理，并说：“群众对我有何意见可通知我，必要时回来道歉都行。”村干不愿收，张主任说：“我们练兵打仗拚命流血都是为了群众获得土地。”（先锋报）
