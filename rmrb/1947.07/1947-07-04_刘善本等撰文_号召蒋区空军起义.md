Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. Air Force personnel Liu Shanben, Zhang Shouyi, Tang Shixu, and Tang Yuwen, who revolted against the civil war, visited various liberated areas after leaving Yan'an last autumn. Recently, on the anniversary of their uprising on June 26th, they jointly wrote an article praising the achievements of various constructions in the liberated areas, especially the land reform and the victories of the People's Liberation Army in various liberated areas. They also used facts to illustrate that "the total collapse of the Chiang family government has begun," and called on the air force personnel in the Chiang-controlled areas to bravely fly their planes to revolt against the civil war and stand with the people. Captain Liu Shanben also separately published "A Letter to the Kuomintang Air Force." The letter listed the facts he witnessed in various liberated areas, proving the achievements of construction in the liberated areas. Liu stated that during their "eight or nine-day journey in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, they did not see a single soldier carrying a gun," indicating that the social order in the liberated areas was stable and the people lived happily, believing that this "cannot but be attributed to the success of the Communist Party in implementing the policy of land to the tiller." Liu specifically detailed his observations entering his hometown of Shandong liberated area and compared it with Shandong more than ten years ago. He used the example of seeing peasants in a village performing a large-scale Yangko opera "The White-Haired Girl" to illustrate that people's lives are affluent and their cultural level has been generally improved. Compared to the "old, backward" and impoverished Shandong more than ten years ago, "it has progressed by more than two hundred years." Liu specifically mentioned that he personally saw the captured commander of the First Brigade and regimental commanders of the Chiang army in the Taiyue Liberated Area, which convinced him of the truthfulness of the news in the liberated areas. Liu emphasized at the end of his article that "the air force can no longer save Chiang Kai-shek's fate of destruction." "Now the time is very short, and there is no room for further hesitation and wait-and-see attitude."

  　号召蒋区空军起义
    【新华社陕北一日电】反内战起义之空军人员刘善本、张受益、唐世旭、唐玉文等于去年秋离延赴各解放区参观。顷于六月二十六日起义周年纪念日联名撰文盛称解放区各项建设之成就，特别对土地改革与各解放区人民解放军的胜利倍加赞扬，他们并用事实说明“蒋家政府总崩溃开始”，号召蒋管区空军人员勇敢的驾机反内战起义，和人民站在一起。刘善本上尉并单独发表“给国民党空军一封信”，该信列举其在各解放区目睹之事实，证明解放区建设之成绩。刘氏以他们在陕甘宁边区“八、九天之旅途中，竟没有看见到一个荷枪的士兵”，说明解放区社会秩序安定，人民生活幸福，认为“不能不归功于共产党实行耕者有其田政策的成功”。刘氏特别详述进入其故乡山东解放区的见闻与十余年前之山东做一比较。彼以在一个乡村里看到农民自己演出大型秧歌剧“白毛女”为例说明人民生活富裕，文化水准已普遍提高。比之十余年前“守旧、落后”及困苦的山东，“进步了何止两百年。”刘氏特别提及在太岳解放区亲眼看见被俘之蒋军第一旅旅长、团长等，使他确信解放区新闻的真实。刘氏文末强调指出“空军已经不能够挽救蒋介石覆灭的命运。”“现时间已经很短，不容再迟疑观望”。
