　　Second District Cooperative Prepares Large Quantities of Autumn Vegetable Seeds
　　[This newspaper's report] Xingjia Yu @ Shutan in the Fourth District of Neiqiu issued a challenge to organize and go to Hanshan Nao and Dongyu Zhang in Shanxi to cultivate and plant 100 mu of buckwheat. Cadres convened a meeting of group leaders and above to study and discuss, all seven mutual aid groups in the village formulated plans, totaling 150 mu to be completed. Challenges were issued between groups, and whoever finished early would be broadcast on the radio. The production committee was responsible for coordinating the seeds, exchanging corn for seeds. All full, semi, and auxiliary laborers in each group were organized, and went to Shanxi at the beginning of this month to plant buckwheat (the land there is cold and needs to be sown early). Five groups completed their tasks in two days, totaling 110 workdays in three days, and completed the cultivation and planting of 158 mu of buckwheat. (Dazhong Daily)
　　[This newspaper's report] Comrade Zhang Qin, the director of the Second District Cooperative in Neiqiu, observed that although there had been a rush of rain, planting some late crops would not yield a large harvest. The masses needed to plant more buckwheat and vegetables to supplement the famine year, but they all reported a lack of seeds. Director Zhang calculated that there were 4,466 households in the entire district, and planting an average of at least half a mu per household (planting half a mu requires 11-12 taels of seeds) would require 3,274 jin. Statistics for the entire district showed that there were currently more than 1,000 jin, leaving a shortfall of 2,000 jin. After calculation, he convened a meeting of cooperative members to study the situation. He instructed the members to go to various villages to collect statistics on the actual shortage and went to the mountainous areas to purchase radish and turnip seeds. He has now bought back more than 300 jin of radish seeds and more than two dou of turnip seeds, selling them to the masses without making a profit. He is still continuing to purchase, to thoroughly solve the difficulties faced by the masses in late planting, and to enable the masses to plant more buckwheat and vegetables. (Dazhong Daily)

    【本报讯】内邱四区行家峪＠树滩提出挑战，要组织起来去山西寒山瑙及东峪掌刨种荞麦一百亩。干部召开组长以上会议研究讨论，全村七个互助组，各组订出计划，总计要完成一百五十亩，组与组挑战，谁完成早，要在广播电台上广播，种子由生产委员负责调剂，拿玉茭换种子，各组所有的整半及辅助劳力都组织了起来，于本月初全部去山西种荞麦（那里地皮寒得早下种），有五个组二天即完成了任务，总计三天时间一百一十个工，共完成刨种荞麦一百五十八亩。（大众报）
    【本报讯】内邱二区区联社社长张勤同志，看到虽然落了抢雨，种些晚庄稼，收成也不会大，群众须要多种些荞麦、菜，来补助荒年，可是都反映没有种子。张社长计算了一下，全区四千四百六十六户，每户平均最低以种半亩计（种半亩以十一二两籽算），就须三千二百七十四斤，全区统计现有一千多斤，还差两千来斤。经过计算后，他就召开社友会议研究，一面使社友分头到各村统计实缺数目，一面即到山川地区购买萝卜与蔓菁籽，现已买回萝卜籽三百余斤，蔓菁籽二斗多，不赚钱卖给群众，现在还继续购买，要彻底解决群众晚种困难，使群众多种荞麦、菜。（大众报）
