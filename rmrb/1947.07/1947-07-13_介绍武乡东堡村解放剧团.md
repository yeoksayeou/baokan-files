    Introducing the Dongbao Village Liberation Drama Troupe of Wuxiang
    Hua Han
    The Dongbao Village Liberation Drama Troupe of Wuxiang grew out of the peasantry and is one of the older and more successful rural drama troupes in the county. It was founded in 1944 and has been around for over three years. This tender seedling of rural culture, cultivated by the peasants themselves, has already sprouted branches and leaves and blossomed into brilliant flowers.
    I
    In the spring of 1944, the enemies entrenched in the county were driven away, and a democratic order was quickly established. A group of young cadres in Dongbao Village began to brew the idea of ​​forming a drama troupe. However, at this time, most of the masses did not yet recognize the new dramas, and feudal and backward consciousness still existed. For example, the old men said: "The devils have just left, and we should be busy with farming. Now we want to put on plays!" "Actors and musicians are lowly people. How can we do plays?" When the Women's Federation secretary went to mobilize He Aimei, her husband heard about it and ran to the Farmers' Association director to question whether he wanted to cause trouble for his family. Her mother-in-law also cried all night about it. Some were afraid of delaying "serious matters," and some were afraid of being called "crazy." As a result, it didn't happen.
    It wasn't until autumn, when the district officially issued a call to establish rural drama troupes, that several active youths decided to set up the troupe. The village cadres took the lead in participating and mobilized their families. In this way, they pieced together seventeen or eighteen people. In addition to the village cadres, there were four elementary school students, four young women, and several older former artists who played the huqin.
    They had the people, but they lacked costumes, curtains, musical instruments, and even the basic necessities of lamp oil, charcoal, and paper. Everyone held a meeting to discuss and made it clear that all problems would be solved by themselves: "We don't know if we can perform well yet, so we can't cause trouble for the village!" The curtain was temporarily made from the large cloth shed of the Sanguan Temple. They put together a set of old gongs and drums. Whoever needed makeup supplies would find them themselves. Lamp oil, coal, etc., were "volunteered" from home.
    Next came the problem of scripts. No one had written any, and no one had experience. But they were not intimidated by these difficulties. They had the courage, dared to try, and had the confidence to create boldly. Shi Sanhai put it well: "Since we want to do it, we can't be afraid of difficulties. We mainly perform our own plays for our own people. We'll write the lyrics as we speak, and the actions and expressions will be based on our usual movements. What isn't something people can do? Let's fumble our way through and see where it leads!" So they started in this self-reliant way.
    II
    The first play performed was "Reception Station" (local Yangko tune), which told the story of the village women warmly receiving wounded soldiers passing through. The plot was simple, and the scene was moving. To their surprise, it received praise from the masses, who all thought that "this is different from the old plays, it's all true" and "the new society doesn't hide merit. With a drama troupe, our village has a voice!" The old men also nodded and said, "The singing is okay"; and with the encouragement of the district, the actors began to understand their creative abilities, experienced the glory of serving the people, and worked even harder.
    Next, they rehearsed "Red Flag Brigade" (the story of the village's production team winning a glorious award at the first Taihang Heroes Conference) and "San Suo Family" (a play about resolving family disputes, also based on real events in the village). In the county's rural drama troupe competition in the first month of 1945, they won the championship, which greatly boosted their morale. At the same time, their prestige among the masses also increased. The villagers voluntarily collected some money and donated it to the troupe. Whenever they performed in the village, the masses sent oil and charcoal. At this time, the number of troupe members also increased from eighteen to twenty-three or four.
    III
    At this time, the drama troupes in nearby villages, on the one hand, due to the call from the superiors, and on the other hand, influenced by the Dongbao Drama Troupe, were also organized one after another. However, some villages did not have a clear understanding of the new and old dramas, and were limited by existing conditions, such as the lack of scripts, teachers, and curtains. Some only had a few old artists and old costume boxes, while the joy of the masses turning over needed to be expressed. They began to sing old dramas. For a time, hiring old performers and staging old dramas almost became a trend. Dramas containing feudal superstitious toxins, such as "Qingzhang River," "Shatuo Kingdom," and "Poxian Meeting," were brought back to the stage. In October, the county held a labor hero conference, and a village drama troupe performed "Qingfeng Mountain" at the conference, which won praise and rewards. Some villages also learned a few old dramas and went to other districts to perform them for money. As a result, the morale of the Liberation Drama Troupe plummeted, and they began to doubt the performance of new dramas. Some said, "Let's disband, new dramas aren't popular!" "We've worked so hard, what do we get? Let's go back to production honestly!" Some suggested, "Let's hire some old performers!" So the troupe went into a slump.
    At this time, the cadres immediately held a meeting to discuss how to stabilize the morale of the troupe members. At the general meeting of all troupe members, the cadres first gave enlightenment: "Why did we organize a drama troupe, working hard day and night? We're not just doing it for excitement, nor are we doing it to win awards or show off, let alone to make money by performing plays! If we haven't done well this time, we should humbly examine our shortcomings. Only by improving our work can we be welcomed by the masses. We can't give up as soon as we hit a snag. We can't do anything well if we do that." Then, personal reflections were conducted. After repeated discussions, most people understood and recognized that "performing plays is to educate the backward. If we perform those feudal old superstitious old dramas, aren't we leading the masses backward?" After the meeting, the cadres also conducted individual talks with those with low morale, and everyone's morale stabilized.
    On the other hand, they also reviewed the performance of the plays themselves, such as proposing: the content should not be flat, so that it can move the audience; the gestures and movements should not be restricted by the old set, but should be created freely; the performance must be serious, not giggling; in terms of clothing and makeup, it should not be too sloppy; some minor tunes can be added to the Yangko... etc. The organization also underwent a new adjustment.
    After the morale recovered, they then rehearsed "Persuading Su Lan," "Persuading Mother," and "Shi Fuli Group." The performances had a good impact. In the first month of 1946, Nanyan Village in Xiangyuan invited them to perform, which won applause and thunderous applause from the audience; they also comforted them, asked them to teach plays, and copied their scripts. At this time, the morale of the actors was raised again.
    IV
    In the movement to turn over, the troupe members actively participated in the work, becoming the backbone of the movement, and timely reflected the struggle to promote the work of turning over. They performed "Shi Lanzeng's Turn Over," "Great Turn Over," and "Ten Thousand People Building," bringing the real and vivid materials of the village to the stage. When performing "Great Turn Over," an honest farmer said excitedly on the spot: "The dogs are so abusive of people!? If we don't vent our anger at this time, when will we?" After this movement, the masses supported the drama troupe even more. For example, Shi Ziying used to be shy when watching others perform, but after turning over, he also volunteered to join the drama troupe; Shi Erhai could not perform, but he insisted on participating, saying: "I can't play a role on stage, but I can do odd jobs, run errands, send messages, and manage things." Because there were too many people who wanted to participate, a group of reserve members was organized to participate temporarily when necessary or around the end of the year.
    Until today, the Liberation Drama Troupe has truly taken root among the masses, become one with the masses, and its prestige has increased day by day. The masses regard watching plays as a serious matter, and they don't get tired of watching a play three or five times. When rehearsing "Ten Thousand People Building," the masses asked them to learn a section and perform a section. From this alone, we can see the relationship between the rural drama troupe and the peasants after the turn over. At the same time, in the leadership, they also pay attention to it. In addition to helping them improve in a timely manner, they also constantly give them honorary and material rewards. The district's award flag reads "Mirror of the People," and the county praises them as the county's "Literary and Art Vanguard."
    Since its establishment, a total of sixteen scripts have been created. The creation of each script is based on the needs of the current task. After each script is performed, it directly or indirectly plays its great educational role. Here are a few examples:
    1. During the performance of "Reception Station," the village was launching a campaign to support the army. Many people watched the play and took out their own things under the saying and thinking that "other women can be models for supporting the army, why can't we?" For example, Liu Xinyu, who had been a temple monk for many years, said: "I used to burn incense and burn my life. Now the Eighth Route Army has saved my life again. Supporting the army is much better than burning incense," and gave a sheep to the army; Liu Chunlian, who was forty or fifty years old, made dumplings and sent them to the reception station for the wounded soldiers; Shi Xian also sent the grapes brought from afar to the wounded soldiers. They said: "If we hadn't seen people performing in the play, the Eighth Route Army would be our lifesaver!" 2. Li Shengwang's mother hated her daughter-in-law when she saw her, and the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law was very bad. In the performance of "Persuading Mother," her daughter E Zhou played an aggrieved daughter-in-law. She was very moved after watching it. E Zhou went back and repeatedly persuaded her, so she later had an amazing change. 3. During the great counter-offensive in 1945, several soldiers in the village died one after another. At this time, the morale of some martyrs' families and military families was very low, and the work of joining the army was greatly affected. The drama troupe performed "Memorial Service" when the coffins were raised. The play pointed out that it is most glorious to sacrifice for the people's cause, and emphasized that the families of martyrs should be treated better, unraveling the "knot" in the hearts of the families of martyrs and setting off a wave of enthusiasm for joining the army. Immediately, nine people including Shi Xiuhu collectively signed up to join the army.
  V
    Based on the above, we can clearly see that the Dongbao Drama Troupe has initially gotten rid of the deviations of pure entertainment, performing plays for the sake of performing plays, and making a fortune, and is moving towards serving the people in a down-to-earth manner and serving the publicity work for the masses. Their writing and performance are completely based on the needs of the times and the needs of the masses. Their slogan is "We will write whatever the newspaper emphasizes"; many scripts are written overnight and performed, and many scripts are never needed after being performed once or twice. This should be the first reason for their success.
    In terms of subject matter, they can adopt real people and real events. In this way, the audience will feel more intimate, easier to be moved, and the effect will be greater. The audience all said: "In the past, watching plays could never figure out which dynasty or generation it was. Now watching plays is all about things that are happening right now, and it's not deceiving at all." This should be the second reason for their success.
    In terms of script writing and rehearsal, a method of collective creation through everyone's discussion is adopted. The production of a script is that the cadres first decide on the theme, then go down to collect materials, come back to discuss and plan the characters, scenes, and plot of the play together, and the editing team writes it out, and then it is collectively revised by the cadres and all the troupe members, and finally passed. During the performance, attention is paid to the audience's reaction. For example, when performing in other villages, people are sent to infiltrate the audience to listen to their opinions and make further revisions; in this way, a script is revised many times. When rehearsing, everyone puts together their own life experience and limited stage experience for actions, expressions, sets, props, makeup, dialogue, etc.; there is no so-called director among them. If there is one, then all the troupe members and even the audience are the directors. Therefore, the completion of each of their plays takes a lot of effort. This should be the third reason for their success.
    In addition, they have done a good job in internal organization, life, and external relations. A democratic leadership and system have been established. They can also help each other to strengthen their studies and improve their political awareness and cultural level. For example, Shi Fuan used to be illiterate, but now he has learned four or five hundred characters. In terms of funding, they are completely self-sufficient and always adhere to the principle of "not causing trouble for the village." Even when the masses proposed to give them a few clothes to make costumes during the distribution of the fruits of the struggle, they did not want them. And they can respect the village cadres and actively implement the laws. Every time they write and perform a play, they discuss it with the village cadres and do not conflict with other work in the village. The male actors still support the difference as usual, and the female actors also do a good job of making military shoes. These are all their advantages.
    The above is the general situation of the Dongbao Village Liberation Drama Troupe. Of course, it still has many shortcomings, but we believe that they have the ability, the method, and the courage to correct and can correct their shortcomings. It is hoped that it can continue to carry forward its existing good style, overcome all the difficulties in the advancement, humbly study, and boldly create. It is also hoped that the local county and district leading organs will help it more, cultivate it, so that it can shoulder greater and more arduous tasks and play a greater role. So that this new cultural flower cultivated by the peasants themselves can bloom more brilliantly and magnificently.

    介绍武乡东堡村解放剧团
    华含
    武乡东堡村的解放剧团，是从农民中生长起来的，是该县几个历史较长、成绩较好的农村剧团之一；四四年成立，至今已三年多的历史了。一枝农民亲手培植的农村文化的嫩苗，已经抽出枝叶，开放出灿烂的花。
    一
    四四年春天，盘据在该县的敌人被打跑了，民主秩序很快建立起来，东堡村的一伙青年干部们，便酝酿搞剧团；但由于这时大部分群众对新戏还没有认识，封建落后意识仍然存在。如老汉们表示：“鬼子刚走了，不好好闹养种，要唱戏啦！”“王八戏子吹鼓手，唱戏也是咱们干的？”妇救秘书去动员赫爱梅时，她老公听说了便跑去找农会主任，质问他是不是不想叫他闹人家？婆婆也为这个事哭了一整夜。有的怕耽误“正事”，有的怕别人说“疯”，结果没有搞起来。
    直到秋后，区上正式提出成立农村剧团的号召，几个积极青年，便下决心要把剧团搞起来，村干首先带头参加，并各人动员家属，这样七拚八凑，便组织起十七八个人，其中除村干部外有四个小学生、四个青年妇女、还有几个岁数较大的旧艺人参加拉胡琴。
    人有了。但服装、幕布、乐器、起码要用的灯油、炉炭、纸张都没着落。大家便开会讨论，明确提出一切问题靠自己解决：“咱还不知道演成演不成哩，可不敢跟村上找麻烦！”幕布暂用三官庙里的大布棚，又凑合了一套旧锣鼓，化装用品谁用谁找，灯油、煤炭等回家“自动”。
    接着就是剧本问题。都没编过，都没经验。但是他们并没被这些困难吓倒，他们有勇气、敢尝试、有信心，能大胆创造。史三海说得好：“咱既然要搞就不能怕有困难，咱主要是演咱老百姓自己的戏，唱词咱自己咋说就咋编，动作表情也照咱们平常的动容架法儿，啥不是人干的？摸索着来吧，弄到哪算哪！”于是便在这种自力更生的情况下搞起来了。
    二
    第一个戏演的是“招待所”（本地秧歌调），剧中写本村妇女殷勤招待过路伤员的故事，情节简单，场面动人，演出后，出人意料之外的得到了群众的赞美，都认为“这可跟旧戏不一样，一满都是实情”，“新社会就是昧不了功，有了剧团咱村里也有了嘴了”！老汉们也点着头说：“唱的倒也可以”；又得到区上鼓励，演员们从此开始了解到自己的创造能力，体验到只要能向群众学习啥事也会办得到。并初步尝到了为人民服务的光荣，干得更起劲了。
    接着他们又排了“红旗大队”（本村生产队在太行第一届群英会光荣得奖的故事），“三锁家庭”（解决家庭纠纷的戏，也是本村实事）等剧。在四五年正月全县农村剧团竞赛大会上荣获冠军，这更大大提高了他们的情绪。同时在群众中的威望也提高了，村里人自动串了些钱，捐给剧团。每逢在村里演戏，群众送油送炭。这时团员也由十八人增添到二十三、四人。
    三
    这时候附近村子的剧团，一面由于上级的号召，一面在东堡剧团的影响下，也接二连三的组织起来。但有部分村庄对新旧剧的认识尚不够明确，又受现有条件的限制，如没有剧本、教师、幕布等，有的却是几个旧艺人和旧戏箱，而群众翻身的快乐又需要发挥、表达出来，便唱起旧剧来。一时请把式、闹旧剧几乎成风；什么“清漳河”、“沙陀国”、“坡前会”等含有封建迷信毒素的戏，又被重新搬上舞台。十月间县上开劳英大会，某村剧团在会上演“清风山”，竟博到赞美与奖励，有的村庄也因此学了几出旧剧到外区去卖。这样，解放剧团的情绪一落千丈，对演新剧发生怀疑，如有的说：“散球吧，新剧吃不开”！“辛辛苦苦的咱落个啥？趁早，老老实实搞去咱的生产！有的提议：“咱也去请旧把式！”于是剧团走向低潮。
    这时干部们便马上开会，讨论怎样稳定团员情绪，在全体团员大会上干部先作了启发：“咱们大家组织剧团，起早搭黑辛辛苦苦的干为的啥？咱不是光为红火，可也不是为了夺奖旗出风头，更不是为了卖戏发财呀！咱们这回没搞好，就该虚心检讨自己的缺点，只有把自己工作提高，才能得到群众欢迎。一碰钉子就灰心，搞啥也搞不好。”接着进行个人反省，在反复讨论之后，大部分人才认识通了，都认是“演戏是为了教育落后，咱要一演那些封建老迷信的旧戏，不是领着群众落后吗？”会后，干部分头又与情绪低落分子进行了个别谈话，大家的情绪才稳定了。
    另方面对演剧本身也进行了检讨，如提出：内容不要平平板板，才能打动观众；手势动作不要受旧一套的拘束，要放手创造，演时一定要认真，不要嘻嘻哈哈；在服装化装方面，也不可太马虎；在秧歌里可以加上些小调………等等。组织上也进行了一番新的调整。
    情绪恢复以后，他们接着又排了“劝素兰”，“劝母亲”，“史福利组”几个剧。演出后，影响很好。四六年正月，襄垣南烟村请他们去演戏，博得台下拍手叫好，掌声如雷；还慰劳他们，请他们教戏，抄他们剧本。这时，演员情绪又提高了。
    四
    在翻身运动中，剧团团员一面积极参加工作，成为运动中的骨干，一面及时的反映斗争，推动翻身工作。前后演出“史兰曾翻身”、“大翻身”、“万人楼”等剧，把本村实际的活生生的材料搬上了舞台。在演“大翻身”时，当场就有一个老实农民激奋地说：“狗操的原是这样欺侮人呀！？不趁这时出气啥时出气？”经过这一运动后，群众对剧团更加拥护了，如史子英以前看别人演戏就害羞，翻身后也自动报名要求参加剧团；史二海不会演戏，也非要参加，他说：“咱不能上台装角儿，咱可能打杂，跑个腿送个信，管个东西可能中”。因为要参加的人太多，便组织了一批预备团员，必要时或年关前后临时参加工作。
    直到今天，解放剧团已经真正在群众中扎下根，与群众打成了一片，威信一天天提高了。群众把看戏当成正经事，一个戏三遍五遍看不俗，排“万人楼”时，群众要求他们学会一段演出一段。只此一点，我们就可看到翻身后农村剧团与农民的关系了。同时，在领导上，对它也很注意，除及时帮助他们提高外，还不断予以名誉和物质上的奖励，区上的奖旗写着“人民的镜子”，县上更誉他们为全县的“文娱先锋”。
    成立至今，共创造剧本十六个。每个剧本的产生都是根据着当前任务的需要。每个剧本演出后，都直接间接地起了它伟大的教育作用。下面谈几个例子：
    一、“招待所”演出时，正值村里发动拥军运动，很多人看了戏就在“人家女人还能当拥军模范，咱就不能？”的说法和想法下，拿出自己的东西。如一个当了多年看庙和尚的刘心玉说：“咱从前烧香，把命都给烧了，现在八路军又救了咱的命，拥军可比烧香好得太多了”，把自己一只羊送给军队；四五十岁的刘春莲捏了饺子，送到招待所给伤员；史仙则把从远地捎来的葡萄也送给伤员。她们说：“没见人家演戏，八路军就是咱救命恩人嘛！”二、李生望的娘看见媳妇就恼，婆媳关系很坏，在演“劝母亲”时，她女儿娥纣扮一个受气的媳妇，她看后很受感动，娥纣回去又再三劝她，于是她后来有了惊人转变。三四、五年大反攻时，该村军人接连牺牲好几个，这时一些烈属军属情绪都很低落，参军工作大受影响，剧团便于起柩时演“追悼会”，剧中指出为人民事业牺牲是最光荣的，并强调应该更好好优待烈属，解开了烈属们心里的“圪塔”又掀起参军热潮，立即便有史秀虎等九人集体报名参军。
  五
    根据以上所谈，我们可以清楚看到：东堡剧团已经初步摆脱了单纯娱乐、为演剧而演剧与风头发财等偏向，走向了脚踏实地的为人民服务，为群众宣传工作服务。他们的编、演完全是由于时代需要与群众需要出发，他们的口号是“报上提啥提的紧了咱就编啥”；有很多剧本连夜排出演出，也有很多剧本演一两次便永用不着了。这应是他们成功的第一个原因。
    在取材上能采用真人真事。这样，观众会感到更亲切，更容易感动，效果也更大。观众都这样说：“从前看戏总摸不清那朝那代那里的事，而今看戏都是眼前事，一点不哄人”这应是他们成功的第二个原因。
    在编剧与排演方面，采取大家商量集体创造的方法。一个剧本的产生是干部会先决定主题，然后下去搜集材料，回来共同讨论计划戏剧中的人物、场面、剧情，由编辑股执笔写出后，再通过干部及全体团员集体修改，最后通过。演出时，注意观众反映，如到外村演出，还派人打入观众听取意见，再加修改；这样，一个剧本不知经过几番增删。在排演时对动作、表情、布景、导具、化妆、交白等等，都是大家根据自己的生活经验和仅有的舞台经验一起凑和；他们中无所谓导演，若说有的话，那么全体团员甚至观众便都是导演。所以他们每个剧的完成，是费去相当大的心血的。这应是他们成功的第三个原因。
    此外，在内部组织、生活和对外关系上，他们都做的很好。建立了民主的领导和制度。并能互相帮助加紧学习，在政治觉悟及文化水平上得到提高。如史富安过去一个字不识，现在已认会了四五百字。在经费上全部自给，始终坚持“不给村上找麻烦”的方针，甚至在分斗争果实时，群众提出分几件衣服给他们做服装，他们也不要。并且能尊重村干，积极执行法令，每编演一个戏，都与村干商量，不与村里其他工作发生冲突。男演员照常支差，女演员做军鞋也都做的好。这些都是他们的优点。
    以上就是东堡村解放剧团的一般情况。当然，它本身仍然存在着许多缺点，但我们相信，他们是有能力有方法，有勇气来改正与能够改正自己的缺点的。希望它能继续发扬既有的优良作风，克服前进中的一切困难，虚心研究，大胆创造。更希望当地县区领导机关更多多帮助它，培养它，使它能够担负起更伟大更艰巨的任务，起更大的作用。使这一枝从农民手里自己培植出来的新文化的花朵开放得更灿烂、更壮丽。
