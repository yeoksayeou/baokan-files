　　【Left-Right News from this Newspaper】 Seven villages in the Third District Central Anti-Japanese Area held a meeting of honorably discharged veterans in Liangyu Village on the 7th of this month. They discussed their relationship with cadres and the masses, the implementation of laws and decrees, production and thrift, and exchanged experiences. Cao Yukui of Zhangba Village said: "We demobilized soldiers should not boast about our merits first. The masses will see our contributions. Since I was demobilized, the masses elected me as a voluntary teacher. After joining the mutual aid group, I also became the leader of the second mutual aid group. Labor hero Sun Chengyin helped me develop a plan for prosperity and thrift. I don’t need the masses to cultivate for me, and I also help military families raise seeds. Although my wound has not healed, I still go out for light errands. During the summing up of the spring plowing, the masses rated me as a special class merit, and I have now been elected as the militia instructor." Zhang Tiancai of Songshuping said: "After being demobilized last winter, when the masses were carrying out land reform, I didn’t act special at all. I first took care of the land reform for the masses. If I had difficulties, the masses would naturally see it. After the land was distributed, the masses discussed cultivating for me, but I proposed that I would hoe as much as I could, even if it was less, and save the civilian labor to cultivate for military families. At the production merit meeting, I proposed a competition with the political director Li Guijiang to cultivate three and save one this year. I am not afraid of empty talk, only afraid of practical work. Now the crops are growing very well." Liu Xincheng of Liangyu Village said: "I was not good at labor when I was in the army, but I have never shown off my qualifications. I am willing to learn from the masses and be a primary school student of the masses. I have never been special in life. I still eat regular meals and wear coarse cloth clothes." Shi Zhonglin said: "Since settling down in Liangyu Village, I have always wanted to do my job well so that I can be at ease, because the revolutionary task has not yet been completed. Once, I did not want my wife to make military shoes. This was wrong. After making a self-criticism, I discuss everything with the masses. Now I have eliminated eight acres of fallow land." After each honorably discharged comrade reported their merits, they also reviewed that there were still individual honorably discharged soldiers and mass cadres who did not have a good relationship in the village, such as Zhang Zixian of Zhangba Village, who hired a landlord's wife to do needlework after getting married. He could cultivate the land himself but used the masses to cultivate for him, which caused everyone's dissatisfaction. One bad piece of meat spoiled the whole pot of soup. They were determined to go back and educate the individual bad comrades. Responding to the call for thrift, everyone decided to save two liang of millet per meal and take the lead in every job. For example, the three comrades Tao Lanxiang and others, honorably discharged soldiers from Shibao Village; this time, when making military shoes, other women made two pairs for three people, and their three family members had to make one pair each, enduring hardship before the masses. Finally, everyone evaluated their merits and selected Liu Xincheng, Zhang Tiancai, and Shi Donglin as county honorably discharged models, each receiving a county certificate, and Cao Yukui and other ten comrades were selected as district honorably discharged models, raising the slogan: Add merit to good deeds, and comrades who have not made meritorious service are determined to catch up.

　　左权荣军带头节约
    【本报左权讯】三区中联防七个村荣退军人于本月七日在梁峪村集会，座谈与干群关系，执行法令，生产节约，互相介绍交流经验，丈八村曹玉魁说：“咱们退伍军人不要首先夸自己功劳，有功群众会看见，我自退伍下来，群众选上我当义务教员，参加互助后，又担任了第二互助组长，劳动英雄孙成寅帮助我订出了发家致富节约计划，不用群众代耕，还又帮助军属养种，虽然伤口未好，轻差还要去走。总结春耕时，群众评选了我特等功，现又当选了民兵指导员。”松树坪张天才说：“去冬退伍下来，群众正在搞翻身，自己毫不特殊，首先照顾到群众翻身，自己困难，群众自然会看见。分上土地后，群众讨论要给我代耕，我提出一天不能多锄能少锄，锄二分算二分，节省下民力给军属代耕。在生产立功会上，提出和政治主任李贵江竞赛，今年做到耕三余一，不怕空说光怕实做，现在长的庄稼很好。”梁峪村刘新成说：“过去当兵劳动上不行，但自己没摆过资格，愿向群众学习，当群众小学生；生活上没有特殊过，吃饭还是家常饭，穿衣还是粗布衣。”石忠林说：“自安家在梁峪村以后，总想把工作搞好才放心，因为革命任务尚未完成。有一次不愿叫我妻做军鞋，这是不对，自做检讨后，每做一件事情也要和群众商议。现在我消灭了熟荒八亩。”经过各个荣退同志表功后，又检讨了村上还有个别荣退军人和群众干部关系不大好，如丈八村张子先，自结婚后又叫了一个地主女人给做针线，自己能种地却用群众代耕，引起了大家不满意。一块肉坏了满锅汤，决心回去教育个别不好同志。响应节约号召，大家决定人人每顿节省小米二两，每件工作带头。如石暴村荣退军人陶兰香等三同志；这次做军鞋其他妇女三个人做两双，他三人家属每人要做一双，比群众吃苦在前。最后大家评功，选出刘新成、张天才、石东林三同志为县荣退模范，每人发县奖状一件，曹玉魁等十同志选为区荣退模范，提出口号：好的功上加功，没立功的同志决心赶上。（秀曾）
