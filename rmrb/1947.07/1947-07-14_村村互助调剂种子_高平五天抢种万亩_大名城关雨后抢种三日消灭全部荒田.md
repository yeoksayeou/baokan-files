    Villages Help Each Other Regulate Seeds
    Gaoping Rushes to Plant 10,000 Mu in Five Days
    Daming Chengguan Rushes to Plant After Rain, Eliminating All Abandoned Fields in Three Days
    [Our newspaper, Gaoping News] After four consecutive hailstorms in Gaoping, the crops suffered heavy losses. It is estimated that 53 villages, besides some seedlings that were saved, needed to replant more than 21,000 mu. After learning of the situation, County Secretary Li, County Head Cheng, and responsible cadres from various systems went to the disaster areas to organize a crash replanting effort. After five days of concentrated effort, the vast majority has been sown, and some have already sprouted. According to statistics from seven disaster-stricken villages (administrative villages) in the first district, a total of 3,989 seedlings were saved, and 93% of the 10,845.41 mu of land was replanted. The following two methods were adopted to mobilize labor for this crash replanting: (1) A general mobilization of the entire village to organize all-inclusive mutual aid teams to do the urgent work first and settle accounts later, advocating that everyone contribute as much as they can, with a clear division of labor, women and children supporting seedlings, cutting wheat, picking up wheat, and picking up stones, and the main labor force and livestock concentrating on sowing. (2) Organizing assistance from other villages, carrying out unequal mutual assistance within the administrative village or village joint team, advocating "farmers all over the world are one family, and everyone helps when one village is in trouble," mostly helping for one day, and some completing certain tasks. For example, Kangying used an all-inclusive mutual aid form to organize all 363 laborers in the village into ten groups, led by village cadres, to carry out a concentrated effort. In Bianjiagou Village, eight natural villages mobilized all 172 laborers to repair the 13 large ditches, five zhang wide, five zhang deep, and forty zhang long, washed away by the water, in half a day, so that more than 300 mu of land belonging to more than 80 households in three natural villages remained flat. Feng Fu-hai, chairman of the Tang'an Village Farmers' Association, proposed to help Kangying with the crash late planting and volunteered to organize 60 people and four livestock, bringing their own dry food and helping for a day without compensation. Guzhai Zhangwo also volunteered to help with 90 people and ten livestock. When Tang'an went, they sent 18 more people. This mutual assistance improved the production enthusiasm of the people in the disaster-stricken villages. Secondly, in the regulation of seeds, two methods were adopted: mutual regulation within the village and mobilizing other villages for equivalent exchange. After the instructor of Beichen Village took out two dan of mung beans produced by the militia, all those in the village who wanted to plant late crops were willing to take them out for regulation. The masses of Tang'an, Yuancun, and other eight villages voluntarily took out 14 dan, 9 dou, 5 sheng, and 6 ge of late-season seeds, which were converted at the market price and exchanged for rice at the rate of 6 sheng of rice per dou to the disaster-stricken villages.

    [Our newspaper, Jinnan, 12th] Yaoshan Third District suffered a hailstorm. Lidongli Village alone suffered losses worth about 2 million yuan. Beisizhuang and other ten villages were the worst hit. More than 20 people were injured. Cotton, grain, sorghum, beans, vegetables, and other losses totaled 6,389,991 mu. After the disaster, district cadres repeatedly explained to the masses "Man will conquer nature, defeat the famine," and aroused the enthusiasm of the masses to rush to plant yam, red millet, corn, beans, and other late seedlings day and night.
    [Our newspaper] After the cadres and activists of Daming Chengguan Street eliminated muddled thinking such as "relying on heaven for food" and "disregarding agriculture" through intensive training, a light rain fell on the 23rd of last month, and the sandy land was just able to be ploughed. The cadres and activists of each street immediately counted the unplanted land in each street and the labor force in the city, and divided them into production, ploughing, rolling, and planting groups, under the unified leadership of the street chiefs and directors. The whole city was swept into a frenzy of crash planting. After three days and nights of concentrated effort, all abandoned fields in the city were planted, with a total of more than 3,000 mu being planted.
    [Our newspaper] After five days of planting and three days of crash planting after the rain in Qizhi County, more than 50% was completed; other districts also completed about 30%. During the planting and crash planting, thanks to the county cadres personally taking action, working day and night, calling on everyone to help each other, and unifying the use of agricultural implements, manpower, and animal power, the county's mutual aid teams have been greatly developed and improved, laying the foundation for long-term mutual assistance. At present, a total of 16,142 full laborers in the county are participating in mutual assistance, with 1,192 long-term mutual aid teams, 1,250 short-term mutual aid teams, 850 women participating in mutual assistance, and more than 100 mutual aid teams.
    [Another dispatch] On June 23rd, Jing County had a widespread welcome rain, and the people were exceptionally jubilant. The County Committee called for a crash planting effort, implementing a general mobilization of people and animals. More than 150,000 mu have already sprouted throughout the county. Comrades from the County Committee, the County Government, and the Relief Association went to various villages to lead the masses in pulling plows and planting. Horses and donkeys from various agencies were lent to the families of soldiers. More than 100,000 mu were crash planted in ten days. In the crash planting in the second and sixth districts, the movement to catch mole crickets was combined, with women and children forming groups of three. The seedlings in the second, fourth, and third districts sprouted at a rate of one percent. In order not to affect grain delivery and production, they used their spare time in the early morning and evening to catch insects, using methods such as setting fires, burning donkey and horse manure, digging up manure piles, and wetting the bottom of manure, etc. In three days, the two districts caught more than 500,000 mole crickets, and more than 500 "big-eyed thieves," which can protect more than 500 mu of autumn seedlings.
    Sun Tianbao is a member of the Farmers' Association Standing Committee. In order to prevent the masses from abandoning preparedness against famine due to the rain, he said at the mutual aid meeting: "In the 33rd year, the government called on us to gather wild vegetables to prepare for famine, but we didn't listen, and as a result, we went hungry and people died! We can't dare not listen this year! We must know that it is better to be prepared than sorry!" Everyone felt that he was right. Some said, "Indeed, we can't be careless, people can still starve to death under the ears of grain." They also proposed: plant 20 mu of late-season black beans and millet, continue to hoe twice, and if it doesn't rain later, each person should water at least two mu of land, and each person should gather 10 jin of wild vegetables. Now each person has gathered 2 jin and dried them. This action has influenced the villages at the base level. (Tunliu Farmers' Daily)

    村村互助调剂种子
    高平五天抢种万亩
    大名城关雨后抢种三日消灭全部荒田
    【本报高平讯】高平经过一连四次雹灾，田禾损失很大，计五十三村除部分苗救活外，需要改种的有二万一千余亩。县上获得情况后，李县书、程县长及各系统负责干部同志，分头到灾区组织突击抢种，经五天突击，绝大多数已经下种，有的已经出苗。根据一区七个受灾村（行政村）的统计：共救活小苗三九八九、自地一○八四五．四一亩的百分之九三强。这次突击抢种在动员劳力上采取以下两个办法：（一）全村总动员，组织一揽子互助组，先做紧活事后总算账，提倡有一分力发一分光，并明确的分工，妇女小孩扶苗、割麦、拾麦、拾石头，全劳力及牲口突击下种。（二）组织外村援助，在本行政村或村联队范围内，进行不等价的互济，提倡“天下农民是一家，一村有难大家帮忙”，大都是帮助一天，也有完成一定任务的。如康营用一揽子互助形式把全村所有劳力三六三人组成十个组，由村干部分头带领，进行突击。边家沟村八个自然村，动员全劳力一七二人，半天时间修好水冲下的十三道五丈宽五丈深四十丈长的大沟，使三个自然村八十多户的三百多亩土地仍成平地。唐安村农会主席冯辅孩提出要帮助康营突击晚种。并自愿组织六十人、四个牲口，自带干量无代价帮助一天，古寨掌窝也愿帮助九十人、十个牲口，去时唐安又多去了十八人，这样互助里提高了灾村群众生产情绪。其次在调剂种子上，采取了本村互相调剂与动员外村等价交换两个办法。北陈村指导员拿出民兵生产下的二石绿豆以后，全村有晚种的都愿拿出调剂。唐安、原村等八村群众，自动拿出晚种十四石九斗五升六合，按市价折算以六升米一斗换给受灾村。（季夫）
    【本报冀南十二日电】尧山三区冰雹成灾，吏东里村即损失约值二百余万元，北寺庄等十村受灾最重，人受伤者二十余名，棉、谷、高粱、豆、蔬菜等损失共六三八九九一亩，受灾后区干好向群众反复解释“人定胜天，战胜灾荒”，鼓起群众情绪，日夜抢种山药、红谷、玉茭、豆子等晚苗。
    【本报讯】大名城关街干部、积极分子自大集训打通了“靠天吃饭”、“轻视农业”等糊涂思想后，上月二十三日偶降三指小雨，沙地刚刚能耩，各街干、积极分子马上统计各街未种土地和全市劳动力，划分了生产、耩地、拉砘、点种等小组，由街长、主任统一领导，全市卷入抢种热潮。经三昼夜突击，全市荒田全部下种，共计抢种三千余亩。
    【本报讯】企之县经过五天点种与雨后三天抢种五十以上；其他区亦均在百分之三十左右。点种抢种中，由于县干亲自动手，昼夜奔忙，号召人人互助，和统一农具、人畜力的使用，使全县互助组得到大量发展与提高，打下了长期互助基础。现全县参加互助的全劳力共一万六千一百四十二人，长期互组一千一百九十二个，短期互助组一千二百五十个，妇女参加互助的八百五十人，互助组一百多个。
    【又讯】景县六月二十三号普落喜雨，群情欢腾异常，县委会号召突击抢种，实行人畜总动员。全县已成苗十五万余亩。县委会和县府及救联会诸同志，纷赴各村带领群众拉耧耩地，各机关的马和驴都借给抗属，十天突击抢种在十万亩以上。二、六两区抢种中结合捉蝼蛄运动，妇女儿童三人结成二、四、三区成苗在百分之一小组，为不影响缴粮和生产，利用早晚闲捕虫，采用点火、烧驴马粪、扒粪堆、湿粪底等办法，三天两个区统计捉蝼蛄五十余万。“大眼贼”五百余个，能保住五百余亩秋苗。
    孙天保是农会常委，他为了使群众不因落雨而放弃节约备荒，在互助会议上说：“三十三年政府号召叫咱打野菜备荒，可是咱不听结果饿肚子，死了人！今年咱可不敢不听！要知道有备无患啊！”大家听了都觉得很对，有的说：“的确不敢大意，谷穗底下还要饿死人。”他们并提出：种晚田小黑豆、黍米二十亩，继续突击锄二遍，以后不下雨，每人最低浇活二亩田，每人打野菜十斤，现在每人已打了二斤晒干，这种行动影响了基点各村。（屯留农民报）
