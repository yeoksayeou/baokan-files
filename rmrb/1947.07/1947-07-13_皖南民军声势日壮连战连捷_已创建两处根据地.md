Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 11th Dispatch: According to the Shanghai press: The Southern Anhui People's Army is growing in strength, winning successive battles, and has established two solid base areas. During the fighting, Chiang's troops revolted and defected to the People's Army. The People's Army units led by Hu and Yuan in the Huangshan area, after briefly capturing Jixi on May 20, launched a victorious attack the next day, surrounding the Dengcheng Township government in the county, seizing many supplies. The People's Army in the Qingyang area besieged Fanchang County on May 23, inflicting heavy losses on Chiang's troops. In mid-May, a unit of the People's Army attacked Zhouwang Village Township government in Xuancheng County, seizing a large quantity of materials such as telephone sets. This village was the location of Chiang's Xuancheng County government during the War of Resistance. Currently, the People's Army in the Huangshan area has established the Xiuning, Yi County, and Taiping Border Area Guerrilla Force, commanded by Lü Hui, and its equipment is extremely sophisticated. The People's Army in the Qingyang area has occupied Jiuhua Mountain in Qingyang County as a base area. This mountain stretches across Qingyang, Shitai, Guichi, Tongling, and Nanling counties, commanding a high position and posing a serious threat to Chiang's agencies and troops in these counties. The Southern Anhui People's Army now controls the Huangshan mountain range spanning dozens of counties, with footprints all along the Jinggui Railway (Nanjing to Qimen in Anhui) and the Yangtze River coast. Due to the growing strength of the People's Army, some of Chiang's troops have begun to defect to the People's Army. On May 23, Wang Kexian, Chiang's Nanling County instructor, led the troops of the Hekou Township government in an uprising. After first disarming all the forces of the Dingdian Township government, they defected to the Hengshantou People's Army on the border of Tongling and Nanling.

    皖南民军声势日壮连战连捷
    已创建两处根据地
    【新华社华中十一电】据沪报讯：皖南民军声势浩大，连战连胜，已建立两处稳固根据地。作战中，蒋军起义，投奔民军。黄山一带胡、袁等部民军，五月二十日一度攻克绩溪后，次日乘胜出击，包围该县属登城乡乡公所，缴获甚多。青阳一带民军，五月二十三日围攻繁昌县城，予蒋军以重大损失。五月中旬，民军一部攻入宣城县属周王村乡公所，缴获电话机等大批物资。该村系抗战中蒋记宣城县府所在地。刻黄山地区民军，已成立休宁、黟县、太平边区游击队，司令为吕辉，装备极为精良。青阳一带民军，已占领青阳县属九华山为根据地，该山横亘青阳、石埭、贵池、铜陵、南陵诸县之间，居高临下，将予各该县蒋记机关、部队以严重威胁。现皖南民军已控制横亘数十县之黄山山脉，足迹遍于京贵铁路（南京至安徽之祁门）沿线及长江沿岸诸地。由于民军力量之壮大，部分蒋军已开始向民军投诚。五月二十三日蒋记南陵县指导员王可羡率领河湾乡公所部队起义，先围缴丁殿乡公所全部武装后，投奔铜陵、南陵交界之横山头民军。
