　　Xinhua News Agency, Jilu-Yu, 8th. The military and civilians in the vast guerrilla areas south of the Yellow River in Jilu-Yu are actively fighting to welcome General Liu Bocheng's counter-offensive army southward, preparing to cooperate with the main force's advance, responding to the call, recovering vast lost territories, and liberating their hometowns. Farmers in various places are rushing to grind military grain day and night to welcome the arrival of Liu and Deng's army, and are also attacking Chiang's army to seize grain. In Juye, 200,000 people are throwing themselves into a wave of storing supplies day and night. Every household is preparing counter-offensive grain, burying or transferring the harvested wheat to safe villages. Fearing enemy looting during the day, they are moving it at night. Except for a portion of young and middle-aged people who are on sentry duty to monitor the enemy, the rest, men, women, old and young, are busily transporting supplies in groups of three or five. One night, when the masses were transferring supplies to a safe village, more than forty enemy soldiers suddenly came out of the reed garden to loot. Our seven armed youths on patrol discovered them and immediately compressed the enemy back. The masses then safely transferred the supplies. In Fucheng County (a newly established county, located between Cao, Shan, and Yucheng), the masses are enthusiastically repairing weapons, preparing ammunition, and organizing tunnels. Each village is inspecting the equipment of the tunnels, such as air holes, gun holes, and lookout posts, to make them more conducive to attacking the enemy. Villages are carrying out joint defense, establishing a mass intelligence network, and blocking enemy news. Young and middle-aged people are on sentry duty, and children are passing messages to enable everyone to respond. Guerrilla teams in various places are expanding their ranks and strengthening their combat effectiveness, intensifying their martial arts training. The "Hero with Rifle Aim" squad of the Huxi County Brigade has surged to forty members in four days, more than doubling its original number. After three days of hard training, the highest record of raising rifles has reached 9,000 times, and raising machine guns has reached 240 times. A certain guerrilla team worked hard to practice martial arts, dedicating all their time to training. Some comrades did not take a nap, and even at night they were still full of interest. After two weeks of hard training, their achievements in raising rifles and aiming have increased three to five times. After long-term training, demolition teams in various places have generally gone to the forefront. The Pingyin demolition team has already reported good news in the Anzi Mountain area. One day, they buried landmines at the Xiaohuzhuang intersection, and two enemy scouts were blown to pieces. The next day, in cooperation with the county brigade, they killed another five enemies and wounded three. The Changqing demolition team killed twenty-one enemy soldiers in three explosions and won the honorary title of "Demolition Pioneer" from the Armed Forces Committee. They are now stepping up their training and studying tactics for attacking the enemy in coordination with the main force.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, 8th. General Liu Bocheng opened the prelude to the great counter-offensive, and the 30 million people of the entire border region have immediately plunged into the raging tide of the great counter-offensive. The Gaotang Brigade of the Jinnan local armed forces and the Nanhe New Soldiers Camp have requested to immediately go to the front lines to participate in the counter-offensive, which has been approved. Soldiers of the Taiyue People's Liberation Army Supplementary Regiment unanimously requested to be immediately added to the combat troops to cross the Yellow River. All the commanders and fighters of the 14th Company of the regiment signed an oath: "We will not go home until we defeat Chiang Kai-shek!" Women in various villages are rushing to make military shoes day and night. Dai Chun'e, a 57-year-old woman from Daixian Village in Qin County, was praised by the people of the entire county and rewarded by the government for her military shoes. She said: "I am old and cannot go to the south of the Yellow River to fight Chiang Kai-shek. Making more military shoes at home is also a contribution." Chiang's military officers in the Taiyue area who laid down their weapons were overjoyed when they heard that the People's Liberation Army was marching south, and they wrote letters home one after another. Yang Huacheng said in a letter to his mother: "Please don't be sad, old lady, we will be reunited soon." He also wrote letters to relatives and friends who were still serving in Chiang's army, advising them to turn back as soon as possible.
