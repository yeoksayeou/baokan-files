    Chengdu Rice-Seizing Riot
    Chiang's Police Tragically Murder Two Women
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Chengdu erupted in its fourth rice-seizing riot in two months on the 5th of this month. According to a TASS dispatch from Nanjing on the 13th: A very large number of people participated in this rice-seizing riot. Chiang's military police actually opened fire on the rioting starving people, and two women were tragically killed by bullets. The agency also reported on the rice-seizing riot in Chengdu on the 22nd of last month, stating: Riots broke out simultaneously at all four gates of Chengdu, and almost all the rioters were women and children. It is reported that Chengdu had successively experienced three rice-seizing riots from May 5th to June 22nd, and June 30th, with each interval becoming shorter.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: Another rice riot occurred in Chengdu on the 12th of this month, the fifth since May. According to a TASS dispatch on the 14th citing a Xinwen Bao [News Daily] report: Several trucks transported rice to the Municipal Government that day, and the masses rushed to the front of the Municipal Government to demand the distribution of rice, but were interfered with by the police. The masses then forcefully prevented the Municipal Government from unloading the rice from the trucks.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 15th: People in various areas of the Chiang-controlled areas have requested tax reductions and exemptions, but have been rejected across the board. According to a Chiang-controlled Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 12th, the taxes for which people in various areas have requested reductions or exemptions include house tax, deed tax, business tax, land tax, license tax, usage license tax, banquet tax, entertainment tax, and slaughter tax. Chiang's "local governments have mostly not responded to the people's requests." Chiang's Executive Yuan has recently instructed provincial and municipal governments, "In the future, taxes will be collected in accordance with regulations on the one hand, and replies will be given on the other."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Reports from Beijing and Tianjin: Recently, rumors have been rampant in Shanghai that Chiang's little court is about to issue large bills of 50,000 yuan each (note: the highest denomination of Chiang's currency previously was 10,000 yuan), and 1,000 yuan customs gold notes equivalent to 20,000 yuan of Chiang's currency. A large number of banknotes without printed serial numbers have also been discovered on the market, causing public panic and soaring prices.

    成都抢米骚动
    蒋警惨杀妇女二人
    【新华社陕北十四日电】成都于本月五日爆发两月来之第四次抢米骚动。据塔斯社十三日南京讯：此次抢米骚动，参加人数极多，蒋记军警竟向骚动之饥民开枪射击，妇女二人中弹惨死。该社并报导上月二十二日成都抢米骚动情形称：成都四门同时发生骚动，骚动者几全为妇女与儿童。按成都曾于五月五日至六月二十二日、六月三十日相继发生过三次抢米骚动，每此距离越来越短。
    【新华社陕北十五日电】本月十二日成都又发生米骚动，此系五月份以来之第五次。据塔斯社十四日引新闻报消息称：是日有卡车数辆运米到市政府，群众涌至市府门前，要求分米，但为警察干涉，群众遂力阻市府卸米下车。
    【新华社陕北十五日电】蒋管区各地人民纷请减免捐税，概遭拒绝。据蒋记中央社十二日南京电透露：各地人民请求减免之捐税，计有房捐、契税、营业税、土地税、牌照税，使用牌照税、筵席捐、娱乐捐、屠宰税等。蒋记“各地方政府对于人民之请求，多不予批复。”蒋记行政院顷饬各省市政府，“此后一面照章征税，一面批复。”
    【新华社陕北十三日电】平津报讯：近来上海盛传蒋家小朝廷又将发行每张五万元（按：以前蒋币票面最高额为万元）之大钞，及合蒋币二万元之千元关金券。市面上并发现大量未印号码之钞票，人心浮动，物价激涨。
