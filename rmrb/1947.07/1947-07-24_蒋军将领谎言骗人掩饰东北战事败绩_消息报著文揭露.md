　　Chiang Kai-shek Generals Use Lies to Deceive and Cover Up Defeats in Northeast China
  　"Message News" Publishes Article Exposing Them
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st] TASS, Moscow, 19th: Molanqing wrote in "Message News" that the fate of the war is not so good for Du Yuming, commander of the Kuomintang Security in Northeast China. The hope of victory brought by American instructors and American weapons has not been realized. When foreign reporters visited him, Du Yuming said with a mournful face that his enemy had indeed obtained "Soviet and North Korean" weapons and manpower assistance, and even obtained this assistance from Japan. Sun Liren, the Kuomintang's other warlord, the Deputy Commander of the Northeast, recently confirmed to American reporters: "The CCP exchanges soybeans for Siberian military ammunition." Kuomintang generals need such lies to cover up the facts. The People's Liberation Army has ample reason to say that, apart from obtaining foreign weapons, including artillery, from the Kuomintang army, they have not obtained anything from any other country. The Liberated Area broadcast reported that the People's Liberation Army has captured more than 3,500 artillery pieces, more than 4,000 machine guns, more than 4,300 anti-tank guns and submachine guns, and more than 49,000 long and short guns from the Kuomintang army in Northeast China in the past year. These include a large number of American heavy machine guns, mortars, flamethrowers and 60 mortars. On June 20, a spokesman for the Democratic Allied Forces headquarters said: "In the past year, more than half of the approximately 180,000 Chiang Kai-shek regular troops who were annihilated have joined the ranks of the Democratic Allied Forces, and at the same time brought enough American equipment and ammunition to equip ten divisions." Now they are using the guns and artillery they got from Du Yuming to attack Du Yuming himself. Louis, the editor of the Afternoon News, ridiculed the recent Kuomintang's absurd fairy tale—saying that "the Soviet Union supplies the CCP with military equipment"—saying that this reveals another way for American military equipment to flow out of the Kuomintang. Louis wrote that the CCP "seized Japanese and some American military equipment, especially American personal weapons and ammunition from corrupt Kuomintang officers." It can be seen that the hypocritical complaints of the beaten Kuomintang generals have obviously fallen through.

　　蒋军将领谎言骗人掩饰东北战事败绩
  　消息报著文揭露
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】据塔斯社莫斯科十九日电：莫兰顷在消息报上著文称：战争的命运对于东北国民党保安司令长官杜聿明是不太好的，美国教官和美国武器所带来胜利的希望，并没有实现。在外国记者访问他的时候，杜聿明哭丧着脸的说其敌方确实获得了“苏联及韩北”武器和人力的援助，甚至还从日本获得此项援助；国民党另一个好战分子东北副司令长官孙立人中将，于最近对美国记者确定的说：“中共以大豆换取西伯利亚的军火炮弹。”国民党的将官们是需要这种谎言来掩饰事实的。人民解放军具有充分理由说出，他们除掉从国民党军队那里获得包括大炮的国外武器外，就没有从别的任何国家获得任何东西，解放区广播报导，人民解放军一年来在东北从国民党军队俘获了三千五百多门炮，四千多挺机关枪，战防炮和冲锋枪四千三百多支，长短枪四万九千多支。内包括有大量的美国重机关枪、臼炮、喷火器及六○迫击炮等。六月二十日民主联军总部发言人称：“一年来，前后被歼的约十八万蒋正规军，有二分之一以上参加了民主联军的队伍，同时带来了足以装备十个师的各式美械和弹药。”现在他们就拿着从杜聿明那里获得的枪炮来进攻杜聿明自己。下午报编辑路易斯嘲笑近来国民党的荒唐童话——说什么“苏联供给中共军备”——谓这泄露了美械军备从国民党手中流出去的又一条路了。路易斯写到中共“缴获了日本及某些美式军备，特别是从腐化的国民党军官手里收到了美式的佩身武器及弹药。”由此可见，挨了打的国民党将军们的虚伪的埋怨显然是落空了的。
