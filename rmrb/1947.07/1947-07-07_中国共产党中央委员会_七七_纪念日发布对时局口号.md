　　Chinese Communist Party Central Committee
  　"July 7th" Anniversary Issues Slogans on the Current Situation

　　(1) Unite all military personnel and civilians in the liberated areas, develop a just patriotic self-defense war, and resolutely, thoroughly, completely, and entirely eliminate all Chiang Kai-shek's invading troops!

　　(2) Unite the people of the whole country to oppose the Chiang Kai-shek government, which betrays the Political Consultative Conference resolutions and implements a policy of civil war, dictatorship, and national betrayal! Restore the Political Consultative Conference line and establish a democratic coalition government! Only a democratic coalition government can eliminate civil war and achieve peace, abolish dictatorship and achieve democracy, and stop national betrayal and achieve the independence of the Chinese nation.

　　(3) Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's civil war policy, and demand peace from Chiang Kai-shek! Punish all war criminals who have sabotaged the truce agreement, launched a counter-revolutionary civil war, and massacred the people during the war. Arrest these criminals and hand them over to the people's court for trial; confiscate their property to compensate the abused people.

　　(4) Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's starvation policy, and demand food from Chiang Kai-shek! Implement resistance to conscription, grain requisition, and levies; confiscate the heinous bureaucrat capital, confiscate the property of corrupt officials and bureaucrats to relieve the starving people, relieve the starving students and public education personnel, relieve unemployed soldiers and martyrs' families who have contributed to the anti-Japanese war, relieve disaster victims and refugees, and protect national industry and commerce.

　　(5) Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial policy, and demand freedom from Chiang Kai-shek! Oppose terror and atrocities, abolish secret service organizations, release patriotic political prisoners, abolish the pseudo-National Assembly and pseudo-constitution that betray the Political Consultative Conference line, and resist Chiang Kai-shek's sham elections.

　　(6) Oppose Chiang Kai-shek's policy of national betrayal, oppose Chiang Kai-shek's borrowing foreign debts to fight a civil war, oppose Chiang Kai-shek's use of American military supplies to kill compatriots, abolish the traitorous Sino-American Commercial Treaty and all traitorous treaties, and repudiate the foreign debts borrowed by the Chiang Kai-shek government during the civil war. Oppose American imperialist aggression against China, oppose the U.S. government supplying Chiang Kai-shek with military supplies to fuel the Chinese civil war, and demand that all U.S. naval, land, and air forces and U.S. advisory groups withdraw from China completely. Unite with all nations in the world that treat us equally to fight together! Establish normal commercial and friendly relations with foreign countries (whether capitalist or socialist) on the principle of equality and mutual benefit.

　　(7) Punish the Japanese war criminal Okamura Neiji, punish all Japanese invaders and traitors who have betrayed the country since the "September 18th" Incident. Stop the revival of Japanese aggression forces and realize Japan's democratization. The materials Japan compensates China must be distributed to the people, and Chiang Kai-shek is opposed to using compensation to fight a civil war.

　　(8) Pay tribute to the great People's Liberation Army, pay tribute to the militia and guerrillas, pay tribute to combat heroes and people's meritorious servants, pay tribute to the martyrs who died in the patriotic self-defense war and their families, and pay tribute to the wounded and disabled veterans of the patriotic self-defense war! All officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army should further improve their combat effectiveness, learn positional warfare, learn flanking tactics, bravely encircle and annihilate the enemy, not let an enemy escape, and completely eliminate the invading troops, seizing the enemy's weapons and equipment to arm themselves. Serve the people wholeheartedly, strictly abide by discipline, and protect the people.

　　(9) Pay tribute to the great people of the liberated areas, pay tribute to labor heroes and model cadres! Strengthen mass work, cadres must integrate with the masses, protect the interests of the masses, and implement the mass line. Use all possible forces to help the army fight, with the army and the people united to eliminate the heinous reactionaries!

　　(10) Resolutely implement land reform, realize land to the tiller, and ensure that all landless and land-poor peasants obtain sufficient land and means of production; protect middle peasants, protect democrats, and punish local tyrants and evil gentry.

　　(11) Develop production and practice thrift and economy, ensuring that the liberated areas have sufficient grain, military supplies, and civilian goods, always considering the overall and long-term perspective to support the patriotic self-defense war.

　　(12) Officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army, do not make unnecessary sacrifices, do not abandon your parents, wives, and children to die for traitors and dictators; Chiang Kai-shek's collapse is inevitable; stage uprisings, oppose war and strike! Those who lay down their weapons will be treated with leniency, those who stop doing evil will be forgiven, and those who continue to do evil will be punished. Kuomintang members, return to Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary stance. The only way out is to break away from the reactionary front, stop reactionary crimes, and turn to the people's side.

　　(13) Pay tribute to the people and their leaders in the Chiang-controlled areas who oppose civil war, oppose famine, oppose dictatorship, and oppose national betrayal, and pay tribute to the democratic fighters who have been imprisoned and killed under Chiang Kai-shek's terror! All democratic parties, all democratic groups, and all democratic elements within the Kuomintang should unite to strive for the victory of democracy!

　　(14) Pay tribute to the minority nationalities and overseas Chinese who are fighting for freedom, unite to strive for the freedom and equality of the motherland!

　　(15) Workers, peasants, intellectuals, patriotic youth, patriotic women, petty bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie, enlightened gentry, and minority nationalities, overseas Chinese, and all patriotic elements throughout China, unite to organize a united front of the whole nation, oppose Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal, civil war, and dictatorship, and establish an independent, peaceful, and democratic New China!

　　(16) Long live the People's Liberation Army! Long live the united front of the whole nation! Long live the democratic coalition government! Long live the liberation of the Chinese nation!
