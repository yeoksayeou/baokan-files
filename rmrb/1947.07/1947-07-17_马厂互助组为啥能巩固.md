    Why the Ma Chang Mutual Aid Team Can Be Consolidated

    The production mutual aid organization in Machang Village, Qinghe Third District, since its establishment in March last year, has not only gradually expanded into a village-wide mutual aid and large-scale labor exchange, but has also been consolidated (75 households and 8 mutual aid teams in the village, 72 people). This spring, they completed the task ahead of schedule during the rush planting and harvesting (22 mu of carrying water and planting beans, 29.8 mu of peanuts, 18 mu of cotton, 39.5 mu of melons and vegetables, and 15 mu of sweet potatoes); during the wheat harvest, the whole village completed the task of harvesting and threshing in five days. On the 18th of last month, the village's Production Committee summarized the rush planting and harvesting work. In the merit-based competition, Han Fenglai and three others were elected as production models, and the Fenglai team was also awarded the title of model team (14 people). In order to exchange experience, the reasons and methods for the expansion and consolidation of mutual assistance in the village are introduced here for reference by the new district in organizing mutual assistance.

    (1) The benefits of mutual assistance have been mastered by everyone through a year of experience. When the mutual aid team was first established, most people held the attitude of trying it out and disbanding if it didn't work. A few people didn't like it, thinking that "six fingers scratching an itch is just one more way," too much trouble, and delayed work. However, under the enthusiasm of most people's experiments, they were also involved in mutual assistance. In a year of mutual assistance, they personally experienced the benefits of mutual assistance:

            Lively and not feeling tired, working harder to save labor and produce more:

    Fenglai said: "Before the mutual aid, each person could not hoe more than 1.5 mu of sprouting seedlings a day. After the mutual aid, getting up early and working hard, they could hoe 2 mu of land a day, and three people did the work of four people." Han Fengqi said: "At the beginning, I didn't like it. When I got used to hoeing the ground and came back at sunset, passing by my land, everyone said, 'Let's do it together,' and in a while, 2 mu of land was hoeed. If it were one or two people, they would have come back without being able to keep up. With more people, they would say, 'Let's take a smoke break,' and then start working. This not only brings up the lazy ones, but also makes people not feel tired even if they work more."

            Exchanging labor and everyone benefiting. Problems can be solved:

    Poor, single-handed farmers can't make a living relying on the land alone. They are afraid of wasting land and can't afford to hire people to do business. Mutual assistance can prevent land waste and earn some money. Han Fengyu said: "I don't know how to do business. I go to bed late and get up early to finish my own work. I work for the team all day long and only earn rice from others." Xue Lihao said: "Poor people can't afford to feed cattle. It's hard to find cattle when they are busy. With mutual assistance, they can plant early and avoid less harvest." It is difficult for middle-peasant households to find people when they are busy. With mutual assistance, work can be done, business can earn dividends, and cattle can earn wages. This fills up the grain produced by their own land. Without mutual assistance, mud houses would be difficult. To hire people, they would have to buy steamed buns and stir-fry a dish, and they would have to buy 1.5 jin for every jin they ate. There is a lot of waste for eating and watching. With mutual assistance, everyone eats their own food, and it's done with one labor exchange. Xue Lihao said: "The widow Xu Yuan, a single-handed person with eight mu of land, sometimes goes to the fields after participating in mutual assistance, and sometimes does needlework for single men without women. Labor exchange and labor deduction solve the difficulties of both parties." Han Fengde said: "Last year, when planting wheat, Han Shanpu and his son could not find anyone to hire, no matter how much money they spent, and the land would be wasted. Because he participated in mutual assistance, the wheat was sown neither late nor less (still planted ten mu). For example, if two people each plant five mu of sorghum, they have to split the leaves themselves. If they do it early, they will harvest less; if they do it late, they won't be able to split them and they will dry out. That family can't stand it without work. With mutual assistance, whoever is early does it early, which not only does not harm the crops but also does not reduce the grain harvest. For example, wheat is said to ripen in a while. It cannot be harvested if it is not ripe. It must be harvested quickly when it is ripe. Without mutual assistance, it will be ruined overnight if there is wind and hail. If you are afraid of being ruined and harvest early, you will harvest less."

            Saving labor for sideline production, harvesting grain and dividing money.

    Mutual assistance makes work faster, saves labor and produces more, and allows some people to be freed up to do business. The Fenglai team of 14 people earned more than 20,000 yuan selling cattle last summer. Later, they took out five people to do transportation with five small carts, earning 250,000 yuan in just five trips. The Wentang team earned 100,000 yuan by transporting ironware and furniture to Wu'an four times. After the wheat harvest this year, the Fenglai team also picked up 10,000 jin of wheat stubble, and the Han Fengde team earned 100,000 yuan by transporting tobacco shreds to Jinan this spring. Finally, there are differences in the speed and quality of work. In mutual assistance, people can learn from each other's strengths and make up for their own weaknesses, learn from each other, and both improve skills and harvest more grain.

    (2) Timely evaluation of work, exchange of labor, recording of total labor, and settlement of accounts. On this issue, they went through a long period of exploration, multiple discussions and revisions, before transforming from a low-level, crude method to a detailed and reasonable scientific method. In terms of calculating labor, in the past, the labor was the same for fine and rough work, fast and slow work. Livestock was not counted as labor and only given some grass. As a result, those who worked well and quickly and those who had cattle felt that they were losing out. Now, labor is calculated according to the work done, and those who do the most work are given ten points of labor a day (two in the morning, four in the afternoon), and livestock is calculated according to the land, with 14 points of labor per mu (six points for plowing, two points each for harrowing, sowing, rolling, and applying fertilizer). This makes everyone satisfied. In the past, evaluation of work and exchange of labor emphasized that everyone's opinions were important and individual opinions were insignificant. There were no clear rules for exchanging or converting labor for doing odd jobs, only mutual help. Over time, the poor who did less work felt that they were losing out, and those who went out to do business did work at home for nothing. They were provided with food and given a reward of five jin of rice per day. If they made a profit, it was okay, but sometimes they lost money and those at home had to do work for nothing and fill in money, while those who went out earned a lot of grain. Therefore, those at home were not satisfied. Now it has changed to: for evaluation of work, first ask the person to express their opinion on the work they have done in a day or half a day. After the score is evaluated by everyone and agreed upon by the person, it is calculated as the standard labor score for a day or half a day (for example, the Xue Lihao team has 11 people, 8 full laborers, one cripple worth 8 points, one old man worth 6 points, and one woman worth 5 points). Women's shoes and socks are priced according to the price, and new fabrics are priced according to the labor (whoever makes it, exchange labor or deduct labor for them). Individual odd jobs are solved with labor tickets. Those who go out to do sideline production do not receive wages for housework or substitute farming, but they are provided with food. If they make a profit, 15% of the bonus is proposed as a reward. Regarding the issue of wages, in the past, regardless of autumn wheat hoeing, each point of labor was half a jin of rice. Those with less land felt that they were losing out during the busy autumn wheat season, and the wages were too low compared to short-term workers. Now it has been changed to a regular and temporary wage system. Regular (hoeing, etc.) is half a jin of rice per point of labor (5 jin of rice for 10 points of labor), and temporary (autumn wheat) is 12 liang of rice per point of labor (7.5 jin of rice for 10 points of labor). In principle, the total daily wage is slightly lower than the wage for short-term workers, taking both sides into consideration. In the past, there was only a labor record book and no labor tickets, and those who were illiterate were a little worried (afraid of forgetting or cheating). The settlement time was too long, the poor could not get rice in time, and the rich also felt that the amount was alarming. Now it has been changed to recording who is doing whose work, how much they have done, and who participated on the book, and labor tickets are issued at the same time. Accounts are settled every half month according to the labor, which solves the problem of eating rice for the poor and makes those with more land feel that they are not taking too much rice.

    (3) The method of checking the rows one by one: whoever is next to whom for the first, second, and third hoeing is always fixed. Regardless of whose land it is, every plot is the same. Whoever hoes that row of seedlings in the first hoeing, they will hoe that row in the second and third hoeing. It is clear at a glance who hoes well or badly, finely or coarsely. Praise, criticism, and introduction of experience are given at any time. Even at the time of harvesting crops, it can be seen. This is not only an invisible competition, but also can give full play to everyone's production enthusiasm, and it is also a good way to prevent backward elements from being slippery and taking advantage of loopholes.

    (4) Regular meetings with clear rewards and punishments. They can insist on holding a meeting every five days. At the meeting, they not only plan production, discuss how to combine sideline production, and increase or decrease wages, but more importantly, they develop the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. Anyone who works quickly and well, does not rely on others, does a good job for the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, cares about the team, and can offer opinions to help others will become the object and condition of their praise and encouragement. Those backward elements who are slippery and do not work well are the object of criticism. In terms of praise and rewards, there are two types: spiritual and material. Spiritual praise is given by the team and the whole village (loudspeaker broadcasts, writing on the blackboard newspaper), recording small merits and publishing them in the newspaper, and recording major merits and giving material rewards. In terms of punishment, first persuasion, second explanation (i.e., criticism), third punishment (reducing points), and fourth expulsion. However, they are very cautious in implementing punishment, treating bad team members with a spirit of leniency and curing diseases to save people. For example, the Fenglai team decided that it should reduce the labor points of ×××, who was slippery and did not work well, according to the regulations. Because everyone criticized him and he showed great humility and was willing to resolutely change in the future, the unanimous opinion was not to reduce his labor points to show education and leniency.

    马厂互助组为啥能巩固
    清河三区马厂村的生产互助组织，自去年三月成立以来，至今不仅逐渐扩大成为全村互助大变工，而且亦巩固起来（全村七十五户八个互助组，七十二人）。今春抢种抢收中提前完成了任务（挑水点豆子二十二亩、花生二十九亩八分、棉花一八亩、瓜菜三九亩半、红薯一五亩）；麦收中全村连割带打五天完成了任务。上月十八日该村生委会总结了抢种抢收工作，在论功竞选中，韩风莱等四人当选生产模范，风莱组亦荣获模范组（十四人）称号。为交流经验，特将该村互助扩大巩固的原因办法介绍出来，供新区组织互助参考。
    （一）互助好处经一年的体验，为每个人所掌握。才开始成立互助组时，多数人抱着试试看不行再散的态度，少数人看不惯，认为“六个手指头搔痒多一道”，太麻烦，耽搁活，但在大多数人试验的热情下，也被卷入了互助中去。一年互助中，他们亲身体验了互助的好处：
            热闹不觉累、比着干省工又出活：
    风莱说：“互助前开头苗，每人一天干不了亩半，互助后起的早干的急，一天能锄二亩地，三人顶四个人干活。”韩风旗说：“才开始我看不惯，锄地看惯了，落太阳回来时，从我地旁过，大家都说捎着吧，一会儿二亩地锄完了。若是一两个人，紧不上去就回来了，人多了一说少吸袋烟吧，打个号就干起来，这样不但把懒的也带起来，而且多作也不觉累。”
            折工换工，人人沾光，有了困难，可以解决：
    贫农独手人，靠地养不住，做买卖怕荒地雇人又雇不起，互助起来不荒地，又能分个钱。韩风雨说：“我不会做买卖，起早睡晚就把自己活干完了，整时整晌的给组里作活，光挣别人的米。”薛立豪说：“贫人喂不起牛，忙时叫牛叫不着，互助后也可早种，不致少收。”中农户忙时叫人不好叫，互助起来活可做，买卖得红利，牛又打工资，这就把自己地多多摊的粮食填起来了。如不互助泥房就困难，叫人就得买馒头炒个菜，吃一斤得买斤半，有吃的有看的，浪费很大。互助起来各吃各的，一换工就完了。薛立豪说：“寡妇徐袁氏独手人八亩地，参加互助后，有时下地，有时给没女人的光棍汉做针线活，工换工、工折工、就解决了双方困难。”韩风德说：“去年种麦时，韩善浦爷们两都发子花多少钱都叫不着人，非荒地不行，因他参加了互助，麦子没晚也没少耩（仍种了十亩）。又如两人各种五亩高粱，自己劈叶子，早了少收，晚了劈不过来就干了，当不住那家没活作。互助起来，谁的早干谁的，既伤不了庄稼又少收不了粮食。如麦子说熟是一晌，不熟不能割，一熟得快割，不互助赶上风雹一夜就瞎了，要是怕瞎早割却少收。”
            做活省的工搞副业，打粮又分钱。
    互助起来干的快，省工又出活，可以腾出一部分人来作买卖。风莱组十四人，去夏卖牛赚两万多元，以后又抽出五人推着五辆小车搞运输，只五趟就赚了二十五万元。文堂组往武安办了四趟铁器家具就赚了十万元，风莱组今年麦收后，又伙拾麦楂一万斤，韩风德组今春往济南推了一趟烟丝赚了十万元。最后是做活有快慢有粗细，互助中以别人之长补己之短，互相学习互相观摩，既能提高技术又能多打粮食。
    （二）及时评工换工记工总工结帐。在此问题上，他们经过了较长时间的摸索，多次的讨论修改，才由低级粗糙转变到细致合理的科学办法上来。算工方面过去在人工上，粗细快慢活都一样，牲畜不算工只给点草，结果活好又快者与有牛的就感吃亏，目前已变为人工按活算，做活最多的一天按十分工（早二上下午各四）牲畜按地算，每亩十四分工（耕六、耙、耩、砘下粪各二分）这样都满意。评工换工，过去强调大家评议个人意见无足轻重，在折换工上，作零星活没有明确规定，只是互帮忙。久之，穷的活少感觉吃亏，外出做买卖的家里活白给作，外出管吃，每天还给五斤米的报酬，赚了还好说，有时赔了在家的既白作活又得填钱，出外的却赚了不少粮食，因此，在家的不满意。现在已变为：评工、首先叫本人按自己一天或一晌做的活提出意见，经大伙评出分数，再经本人同意后，即算一天或一晌的标准工分数（如薛立豪组十一人八个整工，一个瘸子顶八分，一个老头顶六分、一个妇女顶五分）。妇女做鞋袜按价合，衣服新织按工夫订出分数（给谁做给谁换工折工），个别做零活工票换工票解决。外出搞副业者，家里活与代耕活都不要工资，管饭，如赚了提出红利百分之十五作奖励。关于工资问题，过去不管秋麦锄苗，每分工都是半斤米，地少者感觉在秋麦忙时吃亏，比打短工的工资低的太多，现在改为平时与临时工资制，平时（锄苗等）每分工半斤米（十分工五斤米），临时（秋麦）每分工为十二两米（十分工七斤半米）。原则上一天总工资，稍低于打短工的工资数，两相照顾。过去只有记工簿而无工票，不识字者有些不放心（怕忘怕捣鬼），结帐时间太长，穷的不能及时得米，富的亦感数目惊人，现在改为干谁的活？干了多少？谁去参加了？都记在本上，一面随发工票，半月时间按工算帐，这样穷的解决了吃米困难，地多者亦感拿米不多。
    （三）挨耧的检查法：头锄二锄三锄，谁挨着谁始终固定的，不管谁的地那块地都是一样，一遍苗谁锄那耧，二三遍苗还是各锄各的那耧，谁锄的好坏粗细不仅一看便知，随时表扬，随时批评，随时介绍经验，即便到收割庄稼时也可看出来，这样不仅是无形中的比赛，更能发挥各个人的生产积极性，且亦是防止落后分子要滑头、钻空隙的好办法。
    （四）定期会议赏罚严明。他们能坚持每五天开一次会议，在会议上不仅计划生产，讨论如何结合副业，增减工资，且更重要的开展了批评与自我批评的精神，凡是干的快又好，不攀人不靠人，抗属活作的强，在组里能操心，能提意见帮助别人的，就成为他们表扬鼓励的对象与条件，要滑头不好好干的落后分子就是开展批评的对象。在表扬奖励方面，分精神的物质的两种，精神表扬为组里表扬，全村表扬，（啦叭筒广播、写在黑板报上），记小功登报表扬，记大功物质奖励。在罚的方面，一劝二说（即批评）三罚（降低分数）四开除。但他们在执行罚的方面都很慎重，以宽大治病救人的精神对待不好的组员，如风莱组对要滑头不好好干的×××，按规定应当减他工数，因大家批评他后，表现很虚心，愿今后坚决转变，结果一致意见不与他减工，以示教育宽大。（清河小报）
