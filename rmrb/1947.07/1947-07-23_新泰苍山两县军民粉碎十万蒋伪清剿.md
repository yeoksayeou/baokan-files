Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 19th. The 200,000 soldiers and civilians of Cangshan (Xin County) in southern Shandong, in the three months of anti-"suppression" struggle (mid-March to early June), repelled more than 100 enemy attacks, creating a casualty ratio of 200 to 1 between the enemy and ourselves, and defended the vast area of seventy li east-west and one hundred li north-south on both sides of the southern section of the Tai'erzhuang-Weixian Road. The enemy launched nine attacks on this area with forces of one regiment or more, fifty-six attacks with forces of one battalion or more, and more than 100 attacks including small-scale incursions. The enemy used approximately 58,000 troops, including five divisions and seven brigades of regular army. As a result, they were all bravely repelled by the local soldiers and civilians, and achieved the following results: killing, wounding and capturing 634 enemy soldiers and puppets, while we only suffered three injuries, disintegrating 1,200 enemy district and township armed personnel, capturing 19 strongholds, seizing two artillery pieces, three machine guns, six rocket launcher frames, 171 long and short guns, 20 American-made ten-wheeled trucks, more than 40,000 jin of grain, and many other military supplies.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 19th. Li Bin, a reporter from the Central Shandong Branch, reported on the process of 140,000 liberated peasants and working teams in the four districts of Shifang and other areas in Xintai County smashing the two-month "suppression" by more than 30,000 Chiang Kai-shek troops and puppets, stating that after the enemy occupied most of Xintai, they launched a large-scale "suppression" lasting two months, fearing the threat of militia and working teams. In the first stage from April 24 to May 23, they first advanced towards the area from Baimaguan (southwest of Mengyin) in the east to Yaoshan in the west with the "Homecoming Corps" as the main force, supplemented by a small number of regular troops totaling more than 3,000 people. The local people's armed forces took advantage of the enemy's unsettled deployment to launch a fierce attack, and in 16 consecutive battles, we seized the opportunity to recover more than 150 villages. On the 20th, the enemy again launched a four-way attack with a total of 30,000 troops from the entire 25th Division, parts of the 11th and 64th Divisions, and the "Homecoming Corps", starting from Chahe in the east, Loude in the west, Sishui in the south, and Liuzhong in the north. Upon hearing the news, the working teams immediately mobilized and transferred to the outer lines of operation. The enemies who scurried north and south encountered bandits in the San Mountains area and killed each other for three hours. Enraged, the enemy braved the scorching sun and heat on the 23rd, crossed mountains and ridges, and pounced on the southwest Guanshan again for the second time in vain. Our working teams took the opportunity to destroy more than 80 Chiang Kai-shek puppet regimes in only two districts according to statistics. The enemy's first stage of the "suppression" plan was completely bankrupt. On June 6, the enemy continued with the entire 64th Division replacing the 25th Division and began the second stage of "suppression", using surprise attacks and "netting" to gradually annihilate our local armed forces, such as a surprise encirclement of 45 villages in the Chahe district one night, but the working team, under the cover of the masses, suffered no losses and continued to persevere in the struggle. In the nearly two months of anti-"suppression" struggle from April 24 to June 21, in addition to containing the strength of an entire reorganized division of the enemy, in more than 40 large and small battles, 256 enemy soldiers were killed, wounded or captured, while the people's armed forces only suffered three casualties, seizing one small cannon, two machine guns, fifty rifles, and many other military supplies.

　　新泰苍山两县军民粉碎十万蒋伪清剿
    【新华社山东十九日电】鲁南苍山（新县）县二十万军民，于三个月（三月中旬至六月上旬）反“清剿”斗争中，击退敌百余次进攻，创敌我二百比一的伤亡比例，坚持了台（儿庄）潍（县）路南段两侧东西七十里，南北百余里的广大地区。敌对该地区以一团以上兵力进攻者九次，一营以上兵力进攻者五十六次，连同小股出犯，共达百余次。敌动用兵力，仅正规军即有五个师七个旅约五万八千人。结果都被当地军民英勇击退，并获如下战绩：毙伤俘敌伪六百三十四名，我仅伤三名，瓦解敌区乡武装一千二百人，攻克据点十九处，缴获炮两门，机枪三挺，火箭炮架六付，长短枪一百七十一支，美造十轮大卡车二十辆，粮食四万余斤，及其他军用品甚多。
    【新华社山东十九日电】鲁中分社记者李彬报导新泰县石放等四个区十四万翻身农民与武工队，粉碎三万余蒋伪两个月之“清剿”经过称：敌侵占新泰大部地区后，因慑于民兵武工队的威胁，发动了历时两个月的大规模“清剿”。自四月二十四日至五月二十三日之第一阶段中，先是以“还乡团”为主，配以少数正规部队共三千余人，向东起白马关（蒙阴西南）西至尧山地区进扰，当地人民武装乘敌布署未定，先施以猛击，在连续十六次战斗中，我乘胜收复一百五十余村庄。二十日起敌再以二十五师全部、十一师、六四师各一部及“还乡团”共三万之众，东起岔河、西自楼德，南由泗水、北从流众四路合击，武工队闻讯，当即机动转移外线作战。南北窜犯之敌，乃于三山一带碰匪，自相残杀三小时，敌恼羞之下，二十三日再冒烈日酷暑，翻山越岭，猛扑西南关山又二次扑空。我武工队则乘机摧毁蒋伪政权仅两个区的统计即达八十余处。敌第一阶段“清剿”计划遂完全破产。六月六日，敌继以六十四师全部接替二十五师，开始第二阶段“清剿”。利用奔袭“拉网”，企图逐步歼灭我地方武装，如对岔河区一次夜半以突袭包围四十五个村，但武工队在群众掩护下，毫无损失，继续坚持斗争。总计自四月二十四日至六月二十一日近两月反“清剿”斗争，除牵制敌一个整编师兵力外，在大小战斗四十余次中，毙伤俘敌二百五十六名，人民武装仅伤亡三人，缴小炮一门，机枪二挺，步枪五十支，及其他军用品甚多。
