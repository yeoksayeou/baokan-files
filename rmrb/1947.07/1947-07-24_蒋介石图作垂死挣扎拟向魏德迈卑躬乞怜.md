Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 22nd. Integrated reports from Reuters and United Press, Shanghai, 20th: The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous government is making final, obsequious preparations for Wedemeyer's arrival. Reuters learned that "Every department of the Chiang government, including the Resources Committee, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, must submit reports during Wedemeyer's visit." In order to obtain the American master's generous unloosening of the "purse," the Chiang government intends to express its loyalty to the United States by selling out its vote at the Japanese peace conference. According to Reuters: "China (the Chiang government) has not yet formally responded to the American invitation to participate in the preliminary discussions on the Japanese peace treaty, but it is expected that this week, possibly after a meeting between senior leaders of the Chiang government and Wedemeyer, it will announce its acceptance. At the same time, it may issue a statement explaining its views on the voting procedures that should be followed in the Japanese peace conference (note: the American view is to abolish the principle of unanimous voting by the great powers when discussing the Japanese peace treaty)." However, on the other hand, the recognition by American reactionaries that they cannot save Chiang Kai-shek from collapse is becoming increasingly widespread. According to a United Press Shanghai reporter's report on the 20th: "All the American businessmen who have spoken to reporters have repeatedly said that any large-scale dumping of funds by the United States, even if it can temporarily improve the economic situation (in the KMT-controlled areas), will ultimately make the economic situation worse. The Allied loans to China during the war failed to prevent the current malignant inflation, other loans have also failed in the same way, and selling surplus goods to China (the Chiang government) has only slightly slowed down the upward spiral of inflation."

According to the Central News Agency, citing sources from the U.S. military in Shanghai, Wedemeyer and his party are scheduled to fly directly from Guam to Nanjing this morning (22nd) on a special plane.

　　蒋介石图作垂死挣扎拟向魏德迈卑躬乞怜
    【新华社陕北二十二日电】综合路透、合众社廿日沪讯，蒋介石卖国政府正对魏德迈之莅临，作最后的卑躬乞怜的准备。路透社悉：“蒋政府每一部门，包括资源委员会、外交部、经济部都要在魏氏访问时提交报告。”为了求得美国主子慷慨解开“钱袋”，蒋政府正打算以对日和会投票的出卖，向美国表示忠忱。据路透社称：“中国（蒋政府）尚未正式答复美国邀请参加对日和约之初步讨论，但预料在本周内，可能在蒋政府高级领袖与魏德迈会议之后，将宣布接受。同时，可能发表声明，说明其对日和平会议应遵守之投票手续的意见（按：美国意见为讨论对日和约时，取消强国一致投票的原则）。”但在另一方面，美国反动派挽救不了蒋介石的崩溃的认识是愈见普遍了。据合众社上海记者二十日报导：“一切与记者谈过话的美国商人都再三地说，美国任何整批的资金倾销，纵使能暂时改进（蒋管区的）经济情况，然亦终于会使经济情况变得更坏。战时盟国的对华贷款并未能阻止现在的恶性通货膨胀，其他的贷款也已同样失败，出售剩余物资予中国（蒋政府）也仅使通货膨胀的螺旋上升略为迟缓而已。”
    据中央社引上海美军方面消息，魏德迈一行定今（二十二）日晨由关岛专机直飞南京。
