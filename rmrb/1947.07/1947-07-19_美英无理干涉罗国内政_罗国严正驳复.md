Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th. Following the Romanian government's cracking down of the underground terrorist organization "Brotherhood of the Cross" and the arrest of reactionary elements in mid-June, the US and British political representatives in Romania submitted a note of unreasonable interference on June 26th. The Romanian government submitted a reply to the US and British representatives on the 12th of this month, stating: "This action by the US and UK is an act of interference in Romania's internal affairs, and the Romanian government cannot consider the opinions and criticisms in its note." Regarding the US and British note's claim that Romania has obligations under the peace treaty, the Romanian reply retorted: "The peace treaty does not give other countries the power to control and interfere in Romania's internal affairs." The Romanian government warned in the conclusion of the reply: "The only consequence of foreign interference is to further worsen the situation of certain elements that the Romanian government has already dealt with."

    美英无理干涉罗国内政
    罗国严正驳复
    【新华社陕北十六日电】罗马尼亚在六月中旬破获地下恐怖组织“兄弟十字团”，并逮捕反动分子后，美英驻罗政治代表曾于六月二十六日提出无理干涉照会，罗政府已于本月十二日对美英代表提出复文，指出：“美英此举实系干涉罗马尼亚内政之行动，罗政府对其照会中之意见与批评，不能予以考虑。”对美英照会中所称罗国对和约所负义务一事，罗复文反驳称：“和约并未给他国以控制并干涉罗国内政之权。”罗政府于复文结语警告称：“外国干涉之唯一后果，仅能使罗政府所已处置之某种分子处境更为恶化。”
