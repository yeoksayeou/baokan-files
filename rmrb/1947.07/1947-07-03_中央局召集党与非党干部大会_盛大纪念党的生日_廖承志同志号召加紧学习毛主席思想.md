　　Comrade Liao Chengzhi's Speech
    [Special dispatch from this newspaper] At the "July 1st" Central Organs' celebration of the Party's 26th anniversary, Comrade Liao Chengzhi spoke as follows:
    On this, the 26th anniversary of our Party, we are precisely facing the eve of a high tide of the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic movement. In this great change, our Party already possesses nearly two million regular troops and two million militia. Along with the liberated areas with a population of 140 million, it has been proven and recognized by the people of the whole country as the liberator of the Chinese people and the savior of the Chinese nation. The whole world, even the bourgeoisie, has had to publicly acknowledge that the Chinese Communist Party is the only force capable of resisting the fascist traitorous rule of the US imperialism and its running dogs, the Chinese landlord-comprador big bourgeoisie - the Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen regime. It is also the only force capable of crushing this reactionary offensive. The Chinese Communist Party has become one of the important players on the world political stage and one of the important factors in changing the old world. The banner of the Chinese Communist Party has become the banner of the Chinese people, and Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party, has become the only hope of the Chinese people. The experience accumulated by the Chinese Communist Party over the past 26 years has become the common direction of the liberation movement of colonial and semi-colonial people all over the world. The thought and methodology of Comrade Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, has become the treasure and common property of the people of colonial, semi-colonial, and new democratic countries all over the world.
    In the past twenty-six years, the Party has experienced four major revolutionary tides (the Great Revolution of 1925, the Agrarian Revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Patriotic Self-Defense War). In this process, the Party has accumulated countless valuable experiences: success and failure, advancement and retreat, bloodshed and underground work, open and secret, legal and illegal, armed and peaceful, regular army and guerrilla warfare, consolidating power and fighting against counter-revolution, mass movements and dispersed attacks, united front and struggle, and so on. In this process, the Party gained experience by moving from large-city worker and student movements to the countryside and from launching broad peasant struggles to building an army. It also made mistakes, but it further tempered itself. At the same time, the Party also experienced countless setbacks and hardships, and lost many of the Party's most outstanding cadres, such as Shi Yang, Lin Xiangqian, Li Dazhao, Zhao Shiyan, Chen Yannian, Xiao Chunu, Luo Yinong, Yun Daiying, Peng Pai, Yang Yin, Su Zhaozheng, Chen Qiaonian, Zhou Wenyong, Zhang Tailei, Liang Zushao, Cai Hesen, Deng Zhongxia, Ruan Xiaoxian, He Chang, Liu Bojian, Luo Dengxian, Huang Li, Huang Gonglue, Sun Yuqing, Cai Shengxi, Fang Zhimin, Qu Qiubai, Yang An, Guan Xiangying, Zuo Quan, Luo Shiwen, Zhao Shangzhi, Yang Jingyu, Li Zhaolin, Wang Ruofei, Ye Ting, Deng Fa, Qin Bangxian, and many more comrades. These comrades were the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, the loyal fighters of the proletariat, and the most valuable leading cadres of our Party. The millions of martyrs of our Party who have bled and sacrificed in the past twenty-six years will forever be commemorated by the working people of the world and of China. The proletarian integrity shown by these comrades, their spirit of sacrificing everything for the Party and braving fire and water, should forever be the model for all comrades in our Party to emulate.
    Today, after twenty-six years, our Party has become a politically mature and policy-wise experienced party. Every move we make attracts the attention of the whole world. This is entirely due to the ideological leadership of Chairman Mao, who led us through difficult years and repelled the enemy's attacks. He showed us how to combine the universal truth of Marxism with the practice of the Chinese revolution. He clearly resolved the relationship between the proletariat and the peasantry in a country like China, and determined that the peasantry is the main force of the Chinese revolution. He resolved the relationship between the countryside and the cities, and resolved the relationship between China's semi-feudal and semi-colonial status and uneven economic development, that the countryside is the most reliable revolutionary base. The victory of the revolution can only be won through long-term efforts to encircle the cities from the countryside, as well as the decisiveness of armed struggle, the use of tactics with restraint, reason, and benefit, both uniting and struggling, investigation and research, the mass line, seeking truth from facts, and opposing subjectivity. Under the leadership of such brilliant thought, we have overcome countless internal and external difficulties, and finally overcame all deviations, strengthened the Party, made the Party a mass party, and united as one. In the past three great revolutionary stages, the Party has never been as united as it is today, with such leadership, the victory of the revolution is inevitable.
    Today, as we commemorate the Party's 26th anniversary in front of this great revolutionary tide, we should learn Mao Zedong Thought well: The most important point in studying Mao Zedong Thought is to strengthen our confidence in victory, completely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule, thoroughly and completely eliminate its reactionary armed forces, and eliminate every trace of peaceful illusions in the minds of every cadre. Second, strengthen ideological training, raise our ideological consciousness to the level of a conscious proletariat, and eliminate all non-proletarian thoughts. Today, our Party proposes to transform the Party and transform the thinking of every cadre in the land reform movement. This is the most glorious task. Third, our liberated areas are expanding and actively preparing to fight outwards. Therefore, we should further enhance the idea of serving the people. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi said: The work of our thousands and thousands of cadres is to serve the people, not to have the millions of people serve the cadres.
    Commemorate the 26th anniversary of the Party and advance under the banner of Comrade Mao Zedong! We will surely win!

　　中央局召集党与非党干部大会
  　盛大纪念党的生日
    廖承志同志号召加紧学习毛主席思想
    【本报特讯】庆祝党的诞生二十六周年，中央局直属各机关党与非党干部，在驻村俱乐部举行两千余人的盛大纪念会。在这最光荣的日子里，每个党员、每个非党干部，都充满着无限的喜悦，表现出一个共同的意志：勇敢前进，努力奋斗，全面发动大反攻，迎接胜利！
    大会在雄壮的国际歌声中开始，中共中央宣传部副部长廖承志同志号召每个同志，在今天伟大革命浪潮的前面，要以加紧学习毛主席思想，来纪念党的二十六周年（详细讲演见另文）。军区的副司令员，代表中央局作纪念党的二十六周年及反攻动员报告。（详细讲演见另文）最后，大会在“全力发动大反攻，彻底干净消灭蒋介石进犯军”；“彻底完成土地改革，解放一切新收复区的人民”；“坚决执行财经政策，厉行生产节约”；“中国共产党万岁，毛主席万岁”等轰动口号中散会。
    下午九时，中央局并欢宴党与非党各种专门人材和各机关负责同志，表示党对他们的关怀和敬意。边区人民文艺工作团、北大剧团亦共同组织晚会，进行热烈的庆祝。
　　廖承志同志演讲词
    【本报特讯】“七一”中直庆祝党二十六周年纪念大会上，廖承志同志讲演如下：
    在我们党二十六岁的今天，恰恰又面临着一个反帝反封建民主运动高潮的前夜。在这大的变动当中，我们党已具有近两百万正规军，两百万民兵。与数百万党员，一万万四千万人口的解放区，已在全国人民面前被证明与被公认为全国人民的解放者，中华民族的救星。全世界甚至资产阶级，都不得不公认中国共产党是足以抗拒美帝国主义及其走狗中国地主买办大资产阶级的法西卖国统治——蒋宋孔陈政权的唯一力量，也是足以粉碎这反动进攻的唯一力量。中国共产党已成了世界政治舞台重要角色之一，成了改变旧世界的重要因素之一。中国共产党的旗帜已经成了中国人民的旗帜，中国共产党领袖毛泽东同志，已成了中国人民的唯一希望。中国共产党二十六年积累的经验，已成了全世界殖民地半殖民地人民解放运动的共同方向。中国人民领袖毛泽东同志的思想与思想方法，成了全世界殖民地半殖民地及新民主主义国家人民的宝藏与共同财产。
    二十六年中，党经历了四次大革命浪潮（二五年大革命，土地革命，抗日战争与爱国自卫战争），在这当中，党积累了无数宝贵的经验：成功与失败，前进与退却，流血的与地下的，公开的与秘密的，合法的与非法的，武装与和平的，正规军与游击战争的，巩固政权与向反革命斗争的，群众的与分散突击的，联合战线与斗争的等等。这当中，由从事大城市职工运动及学生运动走到农村，由发动广大农民斗争中到建立军队，都取得了经验。也犯了错误，但更断锻炼了自己。同时，党也经历了无数次挫折与艰难，丧失了很多党最优秀的干部。如施洋、林祥谦、李大钊、赵世炎、陈延年、萧楚女、罗亦农、恽代英、彭湃、杨殷、苏兆徵、陈乔年、周文雍、张太雷、梁祖绍、蔡和森、邓中夏、阮啸仙、贺昌、刘伯坚、罗登贤、黄李、黄公略、孙玉清、蔡升西、方志敏、瞿秋白、杨安、关向应、左权、罗世文、赵尚志、杨靖宇、李兆麟、王若飞、叶挺、邓发、秦邦宪等以及更多的同志。这些同志都是中华民族最优秀的儿女，无产阶级忠诚的战士，我们党最宝贵的领导的干部。二十六年来流血牺牲的我们党的千百万烈士将永远为全世界全中国劳动人民所纪念，这些同志们表现的无产阶级气节，一切为党牺牲、赴汤蹈火的精神，应永远为我全党同志学习的楷模。
    二十六年后的今日，我们的党，已经成了政治上成熟、政策运用上老练了的党，我们的每一动作都吸引着全世界的注意。这是完全由于有毛主席的思想领导，他领导我们克服了艰难的岁月，击退了敌人的进攻。他给我们指出了如何将马克斯主义的普遍真理在中国革命实践中结合起来。他明确的解决了象中国这样的国度中，无产阶级与农民的关系，确定了农民是中国革命的主力军。他解决了乡村与城市的关系，解决了中国半封建半殖民地与经济发展不平衡的关系上，乡村才是最可靠的革命根据地。而革命的胜利，惟有在长期的、乡村包围城市中努力争取；以及武装斗争的决定性，策略运用上，有节有理有利、又联合又斗争、调查研究、群众路线、实事求是、反对主观等等。在这样的光辉思想的领导下，我们渡过了无数的党内外难关，最后终于克服了一切偏向，壮大了党，使党成了群众性的大党，并且团结得象一个人一样。过去三个大革命阶段中，党从未有如今日的团结，有这样的领导，革命的胜利是必然的。
    今天，在这伟大革命浪潮前面来纪念党的二十六周年，我们应很好的学习毛主席思想：第一学习毛主席思想最重要的一点，是坚定我们胜利的信心，彻底消灭蒋介石的反动统治，彻底干净消灭其反动武装，肃清每个干部思想中一丝一毫的和平幻想。第二、加强思想锻炼，把我们的思想意识提高到自觉的无产阶级的水平，肃清一切非无产阶级的思想。今天我们党提出在土地改革运动中来改造党、改造每个干部思想，这是一个最光荣的任务，第三、我们解放区正在扩大，并积极准备打出去。因此我们应更加提高为人民服务的思想。正如刘少奇同志所说：我们几千几万干部同志的工作，是去侍候人民，是去为人民服务，而不是千百万人民去侍候干部，为干部服务。
    纪念党的二十六周年，在毛泽东同志的旗帜下前进！我们一定会胜利！
