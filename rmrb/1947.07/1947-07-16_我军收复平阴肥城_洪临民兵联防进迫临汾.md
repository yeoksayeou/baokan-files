Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Front, 14th: After the Shandong People's Liberation Army recovered Tai'an, a portion of the invading Chiang Kai-shek army's 12th Division, which had occupied Pingyin and Feicheng, fled towards Jinan on the 10th. Both cities were subsequently recovered by our forces.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, 14th: The militias of Hongdong and Linfen counties have formed a large joint defense, setting up three lines of defense, and are gradually advancing towards the isolated city of Linfen. The first line of defense is only five li away from the enemy stronghold of Xiaojiqu. The second line of defense guards all the ferry crossings of the Fen River. The third line of defense is a reserve force, coordinating to carry out work in the new areas. The militia calls this layered defense line a "sledgehammer," preventing the enemy from daring to cross the line easily.

    【新华社冀鲁豫前线十四日电】山东解放军收复泰安后，侵占平阴、肥城之进犯蒋军十二师一部，于十日向济南逃窜，该两城随即为我收复。
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十四日电】洪洞、临汾两县民兵结成大联防，布成三道防线，逐步向临汾孤城推进，第一道防线仅距小蓟曲敌据点五里，第二防线看守汾河各渡口，第三道防线为后备部队，配合开展新区工作。此层层防线，民兵称为“铁锤”，使敌不敢轻越雷池一步。
