    【Benbao Ji Lu Yu Eleventh Electric】Millions of peasants in the north and south of the Yellow River in Ji Lu Yu are enthusiastically supporting the southward army under the command of Liu Deng with great enthusiasm. As soon as the counter-offensive army crossed the Wei River, the liberated peasants of Nanle and Qingfeng immediately and automatically organized 1,000 stretchers to cross the Yellow River with the People's Liberation Army. They all regarded carrying stretchers this time as their greatest honor. In Puyang, Chaocheng, Fanxian and other places, the roads were bustling with traffic, and transportation was busy. Lines of people sending medicine, military grain, military shoes and other items were endless. This is the situation in the liberated areas on the north bank of the Yellow River. In the guerrilla areas on the south bank of the Yellow River, from the Longhai Railway to the banks of the Yellow River, in Juancheng, Yuncheng, Dongping, ＠shan, Juye... the vast people of each county, hearing of the arrival of the counter-offensive army, the peasants in each village cheered and told each other, immediately grinding "counter-offensive flour", making "counter-offensive shoes", and making stretchers; the masses within the Kuomintang strongholds immediately became extremely excited, everyone swept away their worries, nodded and smiled, and also prepared to welcome the Liberation Army, secretly grinding flour and making shoes. The women used the finest sieve to sift the flour, preparing it for the counter-offensive army. On each pair of shoes were embroidered the four characters "Victory in the Counter-Offensive," and they were made quickly and sturdily. An old farmer in Tiandian, ＠shan Seventh District, who was over fifty years old, got angry and quarreled with others because he was not organized into the stretcher team. On the evening of June 30, when the counter-offensive army crossed the river, the boatmen along the river came automatically; although the enemy's machine guns were strafing the opposite bank, the boatmen on the boats were all eager to undertake the glorious task of sending the counter-offensive army across the river.
    【Benbao Ji Lu Yu Eleventh Electric】Ten days before Liu Deng's army crossed the river, the news of the great counter-offensive reached Gutai Temple in Dongping Third District in the guerrilla area; that very night, the village chief announced the glorious task of welcoming and supporting the counter-offensive army to everyone; upon hearing this signal of victory, adults and children were immersed in a tense and joyful atmosphere of great battle. That night, the stretcher team was organized, and more than eighty young people enthusiastically participated in the stretcher team; the women automatically formed a model class to replace the work of men. After the meeting, every household was lit up, everyone was busy, all the mills in the village were turning, and enthusiastic young girls were shouting at the livestock in the mill, pushing the fine flour sieves with a thumping sound; and humming a cheerful "Counter-Offensive Little Tune." The fifty-year-old women's association chairman, Xie Guangting, although suffering from severe tuberculosis, carried a red lantern in her left hand and a crutch in her right, running back and forth on the two-mile-long Gutai Temple street, arranging work and inspecting work. Every time she went to a house, she always said to her women members: "This is the time to fight old Chiang, we must grind the flour finer, General Liu's troops are crossing the river to save us, grinding bad flour is letting him down!" The girls also replied with a smile: President, please rest assured, we can't grind bad flour with a clear conscience. Zhang Xianlan, a sixteen-year-old girl, is the daughter of the women's association president. Although she had only just learned to make shoes, she lit a lamp and started making shoes that night; her shoes were not very good, and her mother had asked her to remake them twice, which she accepted willingly. The village chief also found carpenters overnight and made eight stretchers in two days, and after they were made, they were buried in the firewood pile. The people of Gutai Temple were anxiously waiting for the arrival of Liu Deng's counter-offensive army and the arrival of their glorious mission. In those days, when people in the village met, it seemed that there was nothing else to talk about, they always asked: "Are your shoes and flour ready?"
    Two days before the counter-offensive army crossed the river, Chiang Kai-shek's soldier Cao Fulin's troops arrived at Gutai Temple again. The people of Gutai Temple boldly pointed at the backs of those Kuomintang bandits, glared at them, and whispered: "Chiang Kai-shek's dogs! You sons of bitches, how many days can you live! How many days can you bully us common people! When General Liu Bocheng comes, you will lose your dog lives!"

    从黄河边到陇海路
    广大农村欢欣鼓舞迎接支援反攻大军
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】冀鲁豫黄河南北千百万农民，以极大热情全力支援刘邓麾下的南下大军。反攻大军一过卫河，南乐、清丰的翻身农民立即自动组织了一千付担架，随人民解放军渡过黄河。他们这次抬担架，都引以为最大的光荣。濮县、朝城、范县等地，路上真是车水马龙，运输繁忙，人民送药、军粮、军鞋等物的行列络绎不绝。这是黄河北岸解放区的情况。在黄河南岸的游击区，从陇海路到黄河边鄄城、郓城、东平、＠山、钜野……各县广大人民，听到反攻大军到来，各村农民欢欣鼓舞，争相传告，立即磨反攻面，做反攻鞋，做担架；蒋军据点以内的群众，情绪立即高涨万分，人人扫去愁容，含笑点头，也准备迎接解放军，秘密的磨面做鞋。妇女们磨面都用最细的箩筛过，准备给反攻军吃。每双鞋子上都绣着“反攻胜利”四个大字，而且做得又快又结实。＠山七区田店一个五十多岁的老农民，没有把他组织到担架队，他气的和别人吵架。六月三十日晚上，当反攻大军过河的时候，沿河的水手们都自动赶来；虽然对岸是敌人的机枪在扫射，船上水手无不争先恐后，抢着担承把反攻军送过河去的光荣任务。
    【本报冀鲁豫十一日电】刘邓大军未过河的前十日，大反攻的消息就传到了游击区东平三区的古台寺；就在当天的夜里，村长向大家宣布了迎接与支援反攻军的光荣任务；一听到这胜利的信号，大人孩子都浸润在紧张愉快的大战斗气氛里。当夜，担架队编好了，八十多青年踊跃的参加了担架队；妇女们自动的成立了模范班，代替男人的工作。散会后，家家灯火，人人匆忙，全村里的磨都转动起来了，热情年轻的姑娘们，在磨坊里喊着牲口，咕咚咕咚的推着细面箩；轻快的哼出了反攻小调。五十多岁的妇女会长解光庭虽然带着沉重肺痨病，左手提着红灯笼，右手拿着拐杖，在二里多长的古台寺大街上，来回的跑着，布置工作，检查工作。她每到一家门里，总是向着她的妇女会员说：“打老蒋就是这一回，可得把面磨细些，刘将军的队伍过河救咱哩，磨不好面就是对不起他呀！”姑娘们也笑微微回答她说：会长，请放心吧，凭良心也不能磨孬面。十六岁的小姑娘张现兰，是妇会长的女儿，她虽然才学会做鞋，当夜就点好灯做起鞋来；她做的鞋不大好，她母亲曾两次叫她重做，她都乐意的接受了。村长也连夜找来木匠，两天做好了八付担架，做好后，就埋到柴火堆里了。古台寺的人民，在紧张的等待着刘邓反攻大军的到来和自己光荣任务的到来。那几天村中的人，见了面好象没别的话可讲，总是要问：“你的鞋、面准备好了没有？”
    反攻大军未过河的前两天，蒋军曹福林的队伍又到了古台寺。古台寺的人民就在那些蒋家匪徒的背后，大胆的指着他们的脊背，怒视着他们，小声骂道：“蒋介石的狗！你们这些狗日的，还能活几天呀！你还能欺负俺老百姓几天呀！刘伯承将军来了，就没你们的狗命啦！”
