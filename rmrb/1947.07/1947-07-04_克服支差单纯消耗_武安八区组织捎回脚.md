Overcoming Simple Waste in Supporting Labor
　　Wu'an Eighth District Organizes Profitable Return Trips
[Our Newspaper Wu'an News] Last month, the Eighth District organized livestock to transport public grain from Wu'an to a certain place. By utilizing precise calculations and meticulous organization, the entire district combined grain transportation with production, significantly reducing labor by arranging profitable return trips for both people and animals, saving on travel expenses by cooking meals and starting fires on the road, and overcoming the difficulties of excessive spending due to simple waste in supporting labor. (1) Transporting Grain and Profitable Return Trips: The entire village of Nanhe organized 90 head of livestock, with one person leading two, totaling 45 people. They earned 60,000 yuan by carrying back 600 jin of white flour. They earned 24,000 yuan from 40 bundles of bowls, and 60,000 yuan from carrying coal, totaling 144,000 yuan. Baiguan Village earned 85,000 yuan from carrying 340 baskets of coal. (2) Wang Zhensheng, the Director of Support-the-Front in Chongyi, organized the carrying of pots, gathering firewood, and cooking meals, saving a total of 119,000 yuan in travel expenses for 70 people and 120 head of livestock over five days, averaging 1,700 yuan saved per person. They also earned 227,000 yuan from transporting 110 baskets of coal and 120 bundles of bowls, bringing the total savings and earnings to 346,000 yuan. (3) Tanling and Xiwan'an villages used 201 head of livestock. In addition to carrying fodder, each mu averaged 160 jin of grain carried. Over five days, they saved a total of 990 labor days, including manual labor. Beixizhuang in the new district has also achieved the standard of three people per five head of livestock. Shangquan and Beixizhuang also had two veterinarians accompany the team to treat livestock along the way. (4) 1,600 sets of cotton quilts and military uniforms were brought back on return trips. Statistics show that the entire district transported grain for five days, using 1,538 head of livestock to transport 230,000 jin of grain. Excluding Fengdian village, which did not calculate, the 26 villages earned a total of 1.34 million yuan from profitable return trips, averaging 870 yuan per head of livestock and saving 2,167 labor days.
The organizational method was: the livestock in the entire district were organized into two large teams, with each team electing a captain. The captains were responsible for contacting the supply station in advance to ensure quick arrival, delivery, collection, and return, and to find return trips before heading back. Liu Mingshu, the village head of Dahezhuang, led one large team, and in addition to completing his own tasks, he also assisted the supply station's work. After the transportation summary, the masses in each village were very satisfied.

　　克服支差单纯消耗
  　武安八区组织捎回脚
    【本报武安讯】八区上月份组织牲口由武安往某处运送公粮，发挥精确计算严密组织办法，全区作到了运粮生产结合，大量捎回脚和捎回差节省劳力，路上做饭起火节省路费，克服支差单纯消耗，化费太多的困难。（一）运粮捎回脚：南河底全村出动牲口九十头，一人赶两头，四十五人，捎回脚白面六百斤，赚洋六万元。碗四十轴，赚洋两万四千元，捎煤赚洋六万元，合计十四万四千元。百官村捎煤三百四十筐，赚洋八万五千元。（二）崇义抗勤主任王振声组织抬锅、拾柴、吃饭起火，一百二十头牲口七十人五天共省路费十一万九千元，每人省一千七百元；运输捎煤一百一十筐，碗一百二十轴，共赚二十二万七千元，连省运赚三十四万六千元。（三）坦岭、西万安两村牲口二百零一头，除带草料外每亩平均驮粮一百六十斤，五天连人工共省工九百九十个，新区北西庄也已做到了三人五个牲口的标准。上泉、北西庄并有两个兽医跟队沿路给牲口治病。（四）捎回差棉被军装一千六百套。统计全区运粮五天，出动牲口一千五百三十八头，运粮二十三万斤，二十七个村庄除峰店一村没有计算外，二十六村共计捎回脚赚洋一百三十四万元，每头牲口平均八百七十元，省工二千一百六十七个。
    组织办法是：全区牲口组织成两个大队，各队选出队长，负责先给兵站接头，做到快到、快交、快收、快回，找下回脚就返回来。大贺庄村长刘明书带领一个大队，除完成自己任务外，还帮助兵站工作，运输总结后，各村群众都很满意。
