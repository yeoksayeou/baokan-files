Taihang Third Administrative Region

Instructions on Rural Theater Troupes

On July 9th, the Taihang Third Administrative Region issued written instructions regarding the current situation of rural theater troupes in the region, in order to further develop the rural theater movement. The contents are as follows:

To: City and County Heads, Education Section Chiefs, Theater Troupe Leaders:

Most of the theater troupes in our region are transformed from old opera troupes. In the past, they have achieved results in combining with central work, transforming old artists, creating new works, and improving their work style. However, this progress is not rapid enough, and in some places it even lags behind the needs of the people and the work. For example, now that the work has developed, we are still performing "Transformation of Loafers" and the like; now that the heroes have progressed, we are still performing how they suffered and how they turned themselves around. The people want to see fresh and lively small song and dance dramas, but we are still stuck with large dramas like Licheng Yuezi and Shangdang Gongdiao. Therefore, we need more effort in the future to do a good job in the theater troupe work and meet the needs of the masses. Here are a few suggestions on the leadership of theater troupes for future attention:

I. The Direction of Theater Troupes

In the past, it was like this, and it should still be like this in the future: it should be facing the countryside, studying the countryside, reflecting the peasants, singing the praises of the peasants, encouraging the peasants' fighting spirit, enlivening the peasants' lives, and guiding the progress of rural work. Therefore, the theater troupe must first connect with the masses and closely combine with the central work. The performance of a play should strive to run ahead of the work. The theater troupe cadres should clarify the overall work policy for the whole year and the central work of each period. Only in this way can they grasp the key points and reflect them in a timely manner. Therefore, the theater troupe cadres should participate in the necessary work arrangements, work research, and summary meetings. The county and district leaders should constantly provide them with materials, so that their designated interview clues and interview guidelines will be clear, and the work will not be in vain, they will not be unable to write new scripts, and they will not be able to keep up with the central work. The combination of theater troupe work should be proactive and frequent, and they should always pay attention to collecting materials and maintaining close relations with county and district leaders. The theater troupe leaders themselves should grasp the seasonality, be sensitive to problems, pay attention to current affairs, and grasp the changes in the situation in each period, so that they can write more universal and realistic things. In terms of performance style, we should try our best to develop short, concise, lively small song and dance dramas, Yangge dramas, and Kuaiban dramas. Because what the emancipated masses need is their own comedies, these forms are easy, joyful, and most popular with the masses, and it is easy to achieve prominent and timely reflection. Here we should learn from the People's Theater Troupe (Xiangyuan Rural Theater Troupe).

The rural theater troupe should take the propaganda and encouragement work of Beiliu Village in Licheng as the direction of development. It is different from ordinary rural theater troupes, which only perform a few times during the Lantern Festival and the Gregorian New Year. Instead, it uses square song and dance dramas, Kuaiban, and Xiaohua operas to commend the model deeds of typical figures in the village in conjunction with the short-term summary of the village's work and more important anniversaries. This not only promoted the village's work but also harmonized the rural atmosphere, making the peasants' emotions active and their spirits uplifted. The tendency to learn the style of big theater troupes and develop a purely profit-making view, thus becoming detached from the village work and separated from the masses, should be corrected.

II. Leadership Issues

1. Drama is a powerful propaganda weapon that is audible, visible, specific, lively, and vigorous. Drama work should become the core of the new education work. All levels of government cadres and theater troupe cadres should be clear about this. We should attach importance to the theater troupe and overcome the past view of simply using without cultivating. When the central work comes, they are required to write dramas about the central work. When the hero meeting comes, they are required to write and perform heroic dramas within a few days, which makes them flustered and unable to do anything, forming the view of completing tasks. Even at some conferences, they are temporarily pulled to perform dramas, which makes the theater troupe comrades feel that the theater troupe work is singing, using them when needed and abandoning them when not needed. Therefore, the leaders should care about their lives and be responsible for solving practical difficulties. They should help improve their work, pay attention to their cultivation at ordinary times, establish their spirit of serving the people's cultural cause, and overcome the idea that the work of a certain theater troupe has no future.

2. In order to better combine with the central work, the theater troupe cadres should participate in the necessary meetings and be provided with materials in a timely manner.

3. In the past, there have been many instances of communication failures between superiors and subordinates, with the county asking for performances but the district not allowing them, thinking that performing dramas would delay work. This view is inappropriate. Cadres at all levels should be good at using theater troupes to cooperate and guide the central work. For example, last winter, the Victory Theater Troupe was assigned by the county to perform "The White-Haired Girl" in various districts according to plan, which played a great role in raising the peasant class consciousness and encouraging the peasant's fighting spirit.

4. Cadres should support the new theater troupes and overcome the fact that some cadres and masses only watch the old "tricks," starting from their own interests, only ordering old dramas and not performing new dramas. The Seventh Day of the Seventh Lunar Month meeting in Changzhi last year was a typical example, which resulted in the old actors in the drama becoming arrogant and complacent and not learning new dramas. The new actors were pessimistic and discouraged. In any case, we must grasp the direction of the theater movement and gradually reduce the territory of old dramas.

5. The county theater troupe should maintain regular and close contact with the village theater troupes. Support the development of village theater troupes and carry out rural theater movement work. For example, the Huguan People's Theater Troupe has planned to assign troupe members to help various village theater troupes work at certain times. Usually, whenever they perform in a village with a rural theater troupe, they always let the rural theater troupe cooperate in one or two performances in order to provide guidance. This is very good, and the leadership should make helping the village theater troupes and carrying out rural theater movement work one of the main tasks of the county theater troupe.

6. This year's drought has become a reality, and even if it rains suddenly, the harvest has been reduced. In order to take care of the lives of the theater troupe comrades and not abandon this propaganda weapon, the form of their performances should be changed under the principle of preparing for famine and saving. We should carry forward the spirit of the PingShun Farmer Theater Troupe, which only provides meals and does not make money in the mountainous areas of the second and seventh districts, and break the old habit of having a stage every three days. They even help the masses with production during the day and perform dramas at night. The Huguan People's Theater Troupe actively establishes theater troupe housework and strives for self-reliance, only propagandizing and not making money. If we cannot do this, we must at least lower the price of the plays (with the principle of taking care of life and reducing making money), or unite several villages to perform together, or the theater troupe can carry out small-scale activities (dividing into two or three shifts), overcome difficulties, and combine drought resistance, famine preparation, production, and savings for propaganda.

7. We must carry out meritorious service in the theater troupe. In the meritorious service movement on the cultural front, whether in creation, quality and quantity, technical improvement, mass relations, political and cultural learning, or internal housework establishment, we must give play to everyone's enthusiasm and creativity, and select models in a timely manner, clarify experience, and welcome the arrival of this year's Border Region Cultural and Educational Conference.

III. Resolution of Several Practical Problems

1. The number of county theater troupe cadres who are separated from production should not exceed three in each county. Their treatment should be the same as that of district-level cadres, and the grain should be adjusted by the county's local education subsidy.

2. During the theater troupe's collective training period, appropriate assistance can be provided from the local grain according to the actual family property of the theater troupe when necessary.

3. County theater troupe comrades who are separated from production are exempt from service in the village. Cadres should enjoy the same care as political and civilian cadres. We should open up the minds of district and village cadres on this issue. The time that theater troupe comrades spend on performing dramas for conferences, collective training, and comforting the army every year is no less than that of the masses in the village. Hu, Ping, and Lu have already done this, and the remaining counties should also implement it effectively.

### 太行三专署　关于农村剧团的指示

　　太行三专署
  　关于农村剧团的指示
    太行三专署为了进一步开展农村剧运，于七月九日就该区目前农村剧团的情况发出书面指示，内容如下：
    市县长、教育科长剧团团长：
    本专区的剧团大部分是旧戏班改造的、以往不论在结合中心工作上、改造旧艺人上、创作上、作风上，都有成绩。但这种进步还不算突飞猛进，甚至某些地方还落于人民需要与工作的后面。比如工作已经发展了，我们还在演“二流子转变”之类；英雄已经进步了，我们还在演他如何受苦如何翻身。人民愿意看到新鲜活泼的小型歌舞剧，而我们却总还是些黎城乐子上党宫调等大剧。因此今后需要我们更多的努力才能把剧团工作做好，才会满足群众的需要。现就对剧团领导上几个问题提出几点意见，以供今后注意：
    一、剧团的方向
    过去是这样，今后还应是这样：应该是面向农村、研究农村、反映农民、歌颂农民、鼓动农民斗争勇气，活跃农民生活情绪，指导农村工作的前进。因此剧团首先要连系群众，和中心工作紧紧结合。一个剧的演出要争取跑在工作的前面，剧团干部应明确全年整个工作的方针与各时期的中心工作。才能抓取关键及时反映，因此剧团干部应参加必要的工作布置，工作研究及总结会议，县区领导上应不断供给材料给他们，这样他的指定采访线索和采访方针就会明确，工作就不至落空，不至编排不出新剧本，配合不上中心工作了。使剧团工作的结合上要有预见，要主动，要经常注意收集材料，密切和县区领导的关系。剧团领导干部本身抓住季节性，对问题要有敏感，要留心时事，掌握每个时期的形势变化，这样才能编演出更有普遍性、现实性的东西来。在表演形式上要尽量发展短小精悍，生动活泼的小型歌舞剧秧歌剧、快板剧。因为翻身群众他所需要的是人民自己的喜剧，这些形式轻松愉快最受群众欢迎，容易做到反映突出反映及时。这里我们应该向人民剧团（襄垣农村剧团）学习。
    农村剧团应以黎城北流村的宣传鼓励工作为发展方向。他不同于一般农村剧团，只是在元宵节、阳历年出演几次，而是结合本村工作的短期总结及较重要的纪念日，用广场歌舞剧、快板、小花戏把本村典型人物的模范事迹表扬出来，既推动了本村的工作又调和了农村空气，使农民情绪活跃，精神焕发。应纠正学大剧团派头和发展单纯营利观点因而和村里工作脱节，和群众分离。
    二、领导问题
    １、戏剧是有声有色具体生动活泼的有力宣传武器。戏剧工作应成为新教育工作的核心，无论各级政府干部或剧团干部都应明确这点。我们应重视剧团，克服过去单纯使用不加培养的观点。中心工作来了需要他编中心工作的剧，群英会来了要他们几天之内编演英雄戏剧，弄的他们手忙脚乱，苦恼无法，形成完成任务观点。甚至某些大会来了，临时拉他们演剧，使剧团同志感到剧团工作是唱戏工作，用着靠前，用不着靠后。因此，领导要关心他们的生活，负责解决实际困难。要帮助提高他们工作，注意平时的培养，树立他们为人民的文化事业服务精神，克服某剧团工作没前途的思想。
    ２、欲使其与中心工作结合的更好，必要的会议剧团干部应参加并及时供给他们材料。
    ３、过去曾发生过很多次上下关系不通，县上叫演区上不叫演的现象，认为演剧是耽误工作。这样看法是不妥当的。各级干部要善于利用剧团配合指导中心工作。如去冬胜利剧团，县上有计划的分到各区演白毛女，对农民阶级觉悟提高，鼓励农民斗争勇气，起了很大的作用。
    ４、干部要为新剧团撑腰，克服部分干部群众光看旧“把式”，单从自己兴趣出发，光点旧剧、不演新剧。去年长治七月初一会就是典型例子，结果使剧中的旧演员自高自大，不学新剧。新演员悲观泄气，无论如何我们要掌握剧运方向，逐渐缩小旧剧的地盘。
    ５、县剧团应与村剧团保持经常的密切联系。扶植村剧团的发展开展农村剧运工作。如壶关人民剧团，以一定时期便有计划的分配团员下去帮助各个村剧团工作。平时每到一个有农村剧团的村演剧总要让农村剧团配合出一两回，以便指导，这是很好的，领导上应把帮助村剧团和开展农村剧运工作定为县剧团主要工作之一。
    ６、今年旱灾已成，即便倾刻落雨，收成已减。为照顾剧团同志们的生活，与不放弃这个宣传武器，要在备荒节约的原则下，改变其出演形式。应发扬平顺农民剧团在二、七区山地是光管饭不赚钱，打破三天一个台口的老习惯。甚至白天帮助群众生产，黑夜演剧。壶关人民剧团积极建立剧团家务，争取自力更生，只宣传不赚钱。如不能做到这样，最低我们也得降低戏价（以顾住生活减少赚钱为原则），或者联合几村合演，或者剧团小型活动（分为二、三班部可以），克服困难结合抗旱备荒生产节约进行宣传。
    ７、要在剧团中开展立功。文化战线上的立功运动，不论在创作上、质与量上，技术提高上、群众关系上、政治文化的学习上、内部的家务建立上，要发挥每个人的积极性创造性，适时的评选模范，明确经验，迎接今年边区文教大会的到来。
    三、几个实际问题的解决
    １、县剧团脱离生产干部每县以不超过三名为限，待遇与区级干部同，由县地方教育补助粮调剂。
    ２、剧团集训期间，应根据剧团实际家当，必要时可从地方粮里适当辅助。
    ３、脱离生产的县剧团同志，在村一律免服勤务。干部应与政民干部享同样照顾。这一问题我们应打通区村干部思想，剧团同志每年为大会演剧、集训、劳军等时间不比村中群众服勤少。壶、平、潞早已这样做了，其余各县亦应确实执行。
