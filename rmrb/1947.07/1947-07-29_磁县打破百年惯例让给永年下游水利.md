　　Cixian Breaks Century-Old Tradition, Relinquishes Water Rights to Yongnian Downstream for Irrigation
　　[Reported by this newspaper] Yongnian area downstream of the Fu River has suffered a prolonged drought, making it impossible to sow autumn crops, and rice paddies are on the verge of drying up. Historically, the Fu River water rights were traditionally managed to benefit the upstream areas first, and then the downstream; the drier the weather, the more the upstream monopolized the benefits, leaving the downstream unable to plant. In the past, water rights were controlled by landlords and local tyrants; now, power belongs to the liberated peasants. Because of the increased awareness among the peasants after their liberation, they broke the centuries-old, unbreakable tradition. Upholding the spirit that peasants across the land are one family, the peasants of Cixian in the upstream, disregarding their own losses in the first half of the year, released water three times successively. Recently, for the sake of planting in the Yongnian area, they released water once more. Before the release, they had a planned and organized effort to irrigate the land thoroughly day and night, storing water in the rice paddies, and intercepting and storing water in sections of canals and ditches in each village. This resulted in minimal loss to themselves, while revitalizing 300,000 mu of rice paddies downstream, promising a harvest. Tens of thousands of mu of barren land could be sown, playing a significant role in overcoming the disaster downstream. The masses in the Yongnian area are all smiles, expressing their gratitude for the class friendship of the masses in Cixian. (Guang Ju)
　　[Reported by this newspaper, Xingtai] In the 2nd District of this county, the two villages of Jiejiatun and Zhangjiatun had a large river a hundred years ago. Later, due to disputes and discord over the canal water flowing through Zhai Village, relatives broke off relations and ceased contact, and the river water was no longer used. The small stone bridges still remain. This year, during the call for increased production and drought prevention, the district cadres coordinated the masses of these three villages, breaking through the masses' selfish thoughts. With the permission of the masses in Zhai Village, the masses of the two villages were very happy and, after six days of hard work, the canal was opened, with a total length of about six li. In addition to using waterwheels to irrigate the land, the river water can irrigate eight qing of land for the two villages. Now the autumn seedlings are growing vigorously and have been weeded twice. The general masses, while weeding, say, "If it weren't for the good society today, how could we use the river water to irrigate? This is all thanks to Chairman Mao's good leadership." (Yu Min)
　　[Reported by this newspaper, Southern Hebei, 27th] The 4th District of Jize has promoted well-digging for drought resistance in more than 30 surrounding villages, starting from the model village of Li Machang, breaking through the masses' thinking. Initially, the masses felt that digging wells was not easy, as in the past, only landlords and wealthy people dug wells, and they used many things! Later, after repeated mobilization and specific calculations, it was found that bricks could be obtained by dismantling temples. Except for eating a meal or a day's worth of meals on the day of the casing installation, and a little wine for the casing installers (not exceeding two jin at most), all other odd jobs were done through mutual aid and exchange of labor. Digging one well can irrigate 15 mu of land, using a total of eight dou of wheat, averaging only three and a half sheng per mu. The increased production in one season will be more than enough to compensate for this. In this way, the masses' thinking was immediately cleared, and a well-digging committee was established, based on mutual aid groups, forming two mutual aid brigades, and quickly completed five wells. The district cadres summarized the experience of Li Ma model village and spread it to various villages, and a vigorous well-digging movement was launched in the 4th District. According to statistics from more than 30 villages, 50 large wells have now been dug. In Qizhi County, when digging wells, the practice of excessive eating and drinking was abolished, and everyone helped each other. In the 4th District, in just over ten days, 21 brick wells and more than 30 earthen wells have been dug.

　　磁县打破百年惯例让给永年下游水利
    【本报讯】滏河下游永年一带久旱不雨，秋禾无法播种，稻田亦将枯死。滏河水利，历史上惯例是先上游而后下游，越是天旱，上游越独享其利，下游无法播种。过去水利大权，操纵在地主豪绅手里；现在权归翻身农民。由于农民翻身后觉悟提高，打破几百年牢不可破的惯例，上游磁县农民本天下农民是一家的精神，今年前半年不顾自身损失，先后放水三次。最近为永年一带播种又放了一次水，放水前就有计划有组织的连明连夜把地普浇了一遍，稻田里储存了水，并将各村渠沟一段一段的截住，储存了一些水，致以自己极小损失，换得下游三十万亩稻田得以复苏，收获有望。数十万亩白地得以播种，对下游克服灾荒，作用至大。永年一带群众莫不笑逐颜开，感谢磁县群众阶级友爱之谊。（广居）
    【本报邢台讯】本县二区界家屯、张家屯二村，在百年前，有大河，后因渠水流经翟村，因故纠纷失和有亲戚的人家都罢了亲，不互相往来，河水也不使了，所有的小石桥，仍然存在着。在今年号召大生产防旱，区干部给这三村的群众联系好，打通了群众的自私思想。该二村的群众，在翟村群众的许可下，非常欢喜，在六天的努力挑挖下，渠道开妥了，全长约六里，两村除用水车浇地之外，河水能浇田八顷。现在秋苗甚旺，锄了二遍，一般群众，一面锄着，一面说：“要不是今天社会好，咱们怎能用河水浇，这都是毛主席的领导好。”（育民）
    【本报冀南二十七日电】鸡泽四区从打通李马昌基点村群众打井抗旱思想，推动四周卅余村庄打井。起初，群众觉着打井不容易，过去都是人家地主财主打，用的东西可多哩！后来经过反复动员具体算帐，用砖可以拆庙，除下盘那天吃一顿饭或一天饭，下盘人喝点酒（最大不超过二斤），其他零活均互助换工。打一眼井能浇十五亩地，共用八斗麦子，每亩地只合三升半。今后一季增产的东西即可弥补而有余。这样，群众的思想马上打通了，随即建立打井委员会，以互助组为基础，成立了两个互助大队，很快即打成五眼井。区干部把李马基点村的经验总结起来，传播到各村去，轰轰烈烈的打井运动，便在四区掀起来了，据三十余村的统计，现在打好五十眼大井。企之县在打井时取消大吃二喝，大家互助合伙干，四区十余天功夫，已打好砖井二十一眼、土井三十余眼。
