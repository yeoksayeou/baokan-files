Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 11th—Another glorious page has been added to the history of self-defense battles against Chiang's troops. Eleven militia heroes from Zhongwan Township, Shuyang County, Northern Jiangsu, fought against four hundred Chiang's soldiers in a raging fire for half a day, killing more than twice their number, and finally heroically sacrificed their lives. This militia team, under the leadership of Zhang Jiexing, the secretary of the CCP branch and militia instructor in the township, was active in the vicinity of Shuyang in mid-June, protecting the wheat harvest. At dawn on the 16th, they were suddenly surrounded by more than four hundred Chiang's soldiers who had come out of Shuyang city. Zhang and the others, outnumbered, defended a thatched house, bravely repelling several enemy assaults. The enemy, having exhausted their tactics, set fire to the house and threw torches inside. In an instant, flames soared into the sky, and the roof collapsed continuously. Everyone's clothes caught fire. Zhang Jiexing, unyielding and with a hoarse voice, encouraged everyone to fight to the end for the Party and the people, and resolutely break through the encirclement, but ultimately failed due to the enemy's heavy encirclement. During the fierce battle, the militia members died one after another. Finally, Zhang Jiexing, shouting "Long live the Communist Party," immolated himself in the fire. In the battle, they killed or wounded more than twenty enemies, including a company commander. The CCP Huaihai Prefectural Committee specially posthumously awarded Zhang Jiexing the title of Model Party Member on the "July 1st" Festival and called on the entire Party to learn from the indomitable spirit of the eleven martyrs.
