Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd Telegram: TASS, New York: UNRRA Director-General Rooks announced to the press here on the 30th that UNRRA's European operations would end effective immediately. Rooks claimed that UNRRA had delivered a total of 25 million tons of supplies to seventeen European countries, worth approximately $3 billion. However, Rooks emphasized that European economic recovery had not yet been achieved, hunger had not been eliminated, and relief efforts still needed to be doubled. UNRRA was composed of forty member states of the United Nations. According to the UN General Assembly's decision last December to extend UNRRA's work for three months, its European operations were to end on June 30th, and its Far Eastern operations were to end at the end of September.

　　联总欧洲工作结束
  　美国单独进行“救济”控制各国。
    【新华社陕北二日电】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国署后救济总署署长鲁克斯三十日于此向报界宣布：联总欧洲部分工作自即日起结束。鲁氏声称，联总输送至欧洲十七个国家之供应品，总计达二千五百万吨，约值三十亿美元。但鲁克斯着重指出，欧洲经济复原尚未达成，饥饿尚未消除，救济工作仍须加倍进行。按联总为联合国四十个会员国所组成，依照去年十二月联大关于延长联总工作三个月的决议，其欧洲部分工作应于六月三十日结束，远东部分应于九月底结束。
