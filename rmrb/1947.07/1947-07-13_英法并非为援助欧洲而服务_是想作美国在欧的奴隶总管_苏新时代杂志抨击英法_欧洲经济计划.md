Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th. TASS Moscow dispatch: The New Times magazine recently published an editorial on the Council of Foreign Ministers meeting, stating roughly: Bevin and Bidault's proposal to draft an all-encompassing European economic plan is to direct the development level and process of the basic sectors of the national economy of every European country, unconditionally fulfilling the instructions of the "Leadership Committee," in which Britain and France can gain control. Accepting and implementing these proposals by Britain and France would artificially delay the development of certain sectors of the national economy of various countries, while artificially inflating other sectors. This means interfering in the internal affairs of European countries and depriving them of their economic and sovereign independence. This approach by Britain and France is not to serve aid to Europe, but to serve America's leadership in Europe, acting as America's agents in European affairs, becoming slave overseers for the new "Pan-Atlantic" masters. Such a plan of "cooperation" between the rider and the horse as proposed by Bevin and Bidault will never be accepted by countries that cherish their independence.

    英法并非为援助欧洲而服务
    是想作美国在欧的奴隶总管
    苏新时代杂志抨击英法“欧洲经济计划”
    【新华社陕北九日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：新时代杂志顷就三外长会议发表社论，略谓：贝文与皮道尔提议草拟一个无所不包的欧洲经济计划，是去指挥每一欧洲国家国民经济基本部门发展的水平及过程，无条件的履行“领导委员会”的训令，而英法得以在该委员会中获得控制。接受并履行英法这些提议，其结果就会人为的延迟各国国民经济某些部门的发展，而又人为的膨胀另一些部门。这意味着干涉欧洲各国内政，剥夺他们经济与主权的独立。英法这种作法，并非为援助欧洲而服务，而是为美国在欧洲的领导而服务，充当了美国在欧洲事务的代理人，成了新的“泛大西洋”主子的奴隶总管。象贝文、皮道尔所提议的那种骑马的人与马的“合作”的这样的计划，是绝不会为爱护自己独立的国家所接受的。
