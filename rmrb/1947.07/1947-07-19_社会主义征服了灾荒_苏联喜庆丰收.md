    Socialism Conquers Disaster
    Soviet Union Celebrates Bumper Harvest
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 16th] Moscow Dispatch: The entire Soviet Union is celebrating a bumper harvest, and millions of farmers are engaged in harvesting work with great enthusiasm. Many regions have exceeded their spring plowing production plans; for example, the personnel of the "Red October" Collective Farm in the Rostov Province had guaranteed to Stalin that they would increase the yield of winter wheat to 25 centners per hectare (one centner equals 50 kilograms). As a result, they harvested 30 centners. According to a Reuters reporter, this year's bumper harvest in the Soviet Union may lead to the abolition of the bread rationing system and will have surplus grain for export. Lubanov, Deputy Minister of the Soviet Ministry of Agricultural Economics, declared that this year's cultivated area has increased by 8 million hectares compared to last year. In areas severely damaged by drought last year, the cultivated area has not only not decreased but has increased by millions of hectares, which is an unprecedented example in agricultural history. He also pointed out that the government's assistance to disaster-stricken areas with seeds and the widespread use of fertilizers are prerequisites for a bumper harvest.

    社会主义征服了灾荒
    苏联喜庆丰收
    【新华社陕北十六日电】莫斯科讯：苏联全国喜庆丰收，千百万农民正以极大热情从事收割工作。许多地区均超过春耕生产计划；如罗斯托夫省“红十月”集体农场人员，曾向斯大林保证提高每公顷冬麦产量至二十五生丁纳（一生丁纳等于五十公斤），结果收得三十生丁纳。据路透社记者估计：苏联今年之丰收，可能使面包配给制度取消，并将有剩余谷物出口。苏联农业经济部副部长鲁班诺夫宣称：今年耕地面积较去年增加八百万公顷，去年受到严重旱灾损害地区，耕地面积不仅没有减少，反而增加数百万公顷，实为农业史上空前未有之先例。并指出：政府以种子帮助受灾地区，与肥料之广泛使用，均为丰收之先决条件。
