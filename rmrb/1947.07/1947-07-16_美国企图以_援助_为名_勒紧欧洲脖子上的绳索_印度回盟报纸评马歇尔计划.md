Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 11th: TASS Delhi, July 9th: The Pakistan Times, a newspaper of the Indian Muslim League, published an article commenting on the Marshall Plan. It began by stating: "The purpose of the Marshall Plan is to exploit the dire situation in war-torn Europe, embellishing it with the beautiful term 'aid', so that the United States can tighten the noose around Europe's neck, and Britain might even get some crumbs falling from the table. In contrast, the Soviet Union proposes that European countries should be asked what they need, rather than imposing ready-made decisions on them." The newspaper pointed out: "During the war, the United States established UNRRA, which spent many dollars to assist other countries. However, this 'charitable organization' terminated its aid to Yugoslavia because Yugoslavia was unwilling to comply with the political demands of the United States. When the Polish government-in-exile in London ceased to exist, the intention to help Poland also disappeared. The United States had proposed a loan to Hungary, but changed its mind after criticizing the Hungarian government." The newspaper continued: "The United States is approaching a crisis of overproduction, so it is trying to gain more foreign markets. Domestically, the United States deprives people of their freedoms under the pretext of 'Communist mischief.' Externally, it is trying to expand its 'gold dollar empire.'"

    美国企图以“援助”为名
    勒紧欧洲脖子上的绳索
    印度回盟报纸评马歇尔计划
    【新华社陕北十一日电】塔斯社德里九日讯：印度回教同盟的巴基斯坦时报著论评马歇尔计划。首称：“马歇尔计划的目的，就是利用满目疮痍的欧洲严重局势，把“援助”这种美丽字眼加于其上，让美国可以勒紧欧洲脖子上的绳索，并且英国或许也可以得到一些从桌上掉下来的面包屑。苏联则与此相反，提议应该问问欧洲国家需要什么，而不是把现成的决定加在他们身上。”该报指出：“战争期间，美国设立了一个联总，联总花了许多美元来协助他国。但是，这个“慈善机关”国为南斯拉夫不愿意顺从美国的政治要求，即终止了对该国的援助。当伦敦的波兰流亡政府一不存在时，帮助波兰的意图也不见了。美国对匈牙利提议过贷款，但是在指摘过匈牙利政府后，又变了心。”该报继称：“美国因逼近了生产过剩的危机，故正在试图获得更多的国外市场。在国内，美国借口‘共产党作怪’而剥夺人民的自由权。对外，则试图扩张‘金元王国’。”
