　　Border Region Government Cadres Go to Southern Hebei and Taiyue
  　To Inspect and Promote the Production Campaign
  　Changzhi Sudian Inspects Production, Praises Models and Awards Merits
    [Our Newspaper News] Sowing work has been nearly completed in most areas. Some areas are rushing to weed and protect seedlings, as well as continuing to carry water for planting, emergency planting, and replanting. In order to promote the great production movement, especially the current weeding and seedling protection, implement the Central Bureau's "Three Ones Instruction," and respond to the call for drought resistance and preparation for famine, the Border Region Government has specially decided to dispatch cadres to the countryside for a vigorous inspection and promotion. The dispatched cadres are divided into two groups, one going to Taiyue and the other to Southern Hebei, combining with the cadres dispatched by the administrative offices at all levels and the intentions of the district party committees and administrative offices, to delve into the villages, conduct typical research and understand the general situation. Taihang is independently organizing forces to conduct inspections and is drawing some cadres from counties and districts with different types of work development to report on the situation to the Border Region Government and discuss specific issues.
    [Our Newspaper Changzhi News] In the past, Sudian only made challenges without inspection or summarization, turning challenges into a formality with a beginning but no end. After the first weeding, in order to improve the movement, a meeting of about eighty cadres and team leaders was held, raising the questions: What is the purpose of inspection? How to inspect? What to inspect? After discussion, Su Suo said: "Inspection is not about finding faults, but about learning from each other and exchanging experiences. We must adopt the correct attitude. No matter which street or team has good methods and good experiences, we should learn from each other." Zhu Xi said: "Yes! My attitude was not correct. When people said Team Eryun was good, I wanted to find fault with them." Together with 120 cadres and masses organized throughout the village, they were divided into six groups, went out for inspection for half a day, visited the streets at night for one night, and held a meeting the next day for evaluation. It was evaluated that Shangdong Street was better with not much grass, the families of soldiers and martyrs had mostly weeded twice, and the methods of calculating work points and arranging life were good. For example, in fields with less corn grass, weeding 0.12 hectare was equivalent to ten points, and in fields with more grass, weeding 0.1 hectare was equivalent to ten points. One shortcoming was that they only cared about their own street and did not take care of the whole village. The best mutual aid teams in each street were Bi Eryun and Du Chouren. Eryun opened two mills, and all the women in the team spun, weaved, and weeded. There was very little grass in the fields, and they had already weeded three times and would weed two more times, adding 20 dan of manure per mu, requiring two applications of fertilizer, and had already applied it once. After the inspection, model selection and commendation were carried out. Taking the street as a unit, a mass meeting was held, and the standards for model teams were initially formulated: 1. Have a struggle plan of "cultivating two and having one surplus"; 2. Be able to achieve "agriculture, sideline occupations, and participation in the war without error"; 3. Solve problems within the team immediately; 4. Arrange life, calculate work points, and clear work tickets. As a result of the evaluation, Bi Eryun was a model. Eryun's wife learned to weave and taught others, and was selected as a weaving model. Bi Suo, a family member of a soldier and martyr, did not need help farming his own 0.2 hectare of land and also helped others, and also cleared up the excessively high expectations of three families of soldiers and martyrs, and was selected as a model family of soldiers and martyrs; Li Jinyu voluntarily washed fifteen pieces of clothing for the army and was selected as a model of loving the army; Niu Changgen did his own land once and weeded the land for the families of soldiers and martyrs twice, and was selected as an outstanding model of supporting the army. Others, such as the director of the armed forces committee and the street chief, were given merit, both large and small, for their active work. After the models were selected, a congratulatory meeting was held by more than 1,000 people in the village. The masses' enthusiasm was very high. Challenges were immediately made by each street. The challenge conditions proposed by Bi Eryun on behalf of his street were: The autumn land must be completed three times by June 15th, and the wheat land must be plowed twice. There are currently six weaving machines in the street, which has 90 households, and three more will be added to reach one machine per ten households, and seven more large spinning wheels will be added. In terms of frugality, it is guaranteed to clear up the masses' thinking, take out 30 shi of wheat to exchange for 45 shi of corn, and 20 shi of wheat have already been taken out in exchange for 29 shi of corn. Each household does not eat noodles, does not light lamps when eating at night, and each household saves 0.5 kg of salt per month. Each street challenged each other, determined the inspection date, and everyone worked hard to strive for the model. (Sudian Correspondent Team)
