Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 20th: After the People's Liberation Army conquered Yuncheng, American-made Chiang planes carried out an inhuman and brutal bombing. On the 8th alone, from 6:00 AM to 7:00 PM, there were a total of 11 waves, with each wave consisting of up to seven planes and as few as two. Civilian casualties numbered more than 30, and some wounded soldiers from the captured Chiang army's 55th Division, who could have been treated, also died tragically on stretchers because the planes bombed the city before they could be evacuated. The bombing targets were mainly the Tianzhu (Catholic) Church area in the city center in the morning, and gradually extended to the east and west passes in the afternoon. Many heavy bombs were dropped, with more than 300 bombs falling in the Tianzhu Church and its vicinity alone. During the bombing, the military and political personnel of the Liberated Area actively rescued the citizens, rushed to the disaster areas, and worked with the citizens to excavate the victims. At night, the democratic government immediately distributed emergency relief to aid the affected citizens. According to Chiang Kai-shek's Operations Order No. 933 from the Ministry of National Defense, which was captured this time, Chiang Kai-shek had clearly instructed his subordinates to carry out this kind of cruel and heinous crime against the people of the Liberated Areas. Article 7 of the order stated: "When the National Army withdraws from bandit areas or is transferred to other defense areas, the air force should be dispatched to bomb the incident site to punish it." From this, it can be seen that Chiang Kai-shek has long become a dehumanized, mad beast.

　　蒋介石久已毫无人性吃了败仗就轰炸人民
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线二十日电】人民解放军克服郓城后，美制蒋机施行惨无人道的兽性大轰炸。仅八日自晨六时起至十九时，共计达十一批之多，每批多者七架，少者两架。市民伤亡达三十余人，一部分可以医治的被俘蒋军五十五师之伤员，也因为飞机轰炸，来不及运出城而惨死于救护架上。轰炸之目标，午前为市中心区之天主教堂一带，午后渐及东、西两关，投掷重磅炸弹甚多，仅天主教堂及其附近为数在三百枚以上。解放区军政工作人员于轰炸间积极抢救市民，奔赴被灾地点与市民共同挖掘受难者，入夜，民主政府立即发放急赈，救济受灾市民。据此次缴获之蒋记国防部作战九三三号电令证明，蒋介石曾明示其部属对解放区人民此种残酷的滔天罪行。该电令第七条供称：“国军退出匪区或调其他防地，该肇事地点应派空军予以轰炸以惩罚。”由此可见蒋介石久已成为一毫无人性的疯狂的野兽。
