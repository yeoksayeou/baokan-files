    Eight Years Beside the Bellows
    Saving Twelve Thousand Annually
    Wu Youzhen Awarded First-Class Merit
    Shahe County Government Commends Model
    [Our Newspaper] To commemorate "July 1st," the Political Department of the Taihang Military Region spent ten days evaluating the meritorious personnel and models of the past six months. Fifteen meritorious personnel were selected. Comrade Wu Youzhen, a cook, was selected as the top meritorious person. He has been working beside the bellows for eight years, consistently. He gets up before dawn and boils twelve pots of water a day. When he has time, he also helps the tofu workshop press soybeans. Due to his special innovation in operating the bellows, he saves more than 120,000 silver dollars worth of coal each year…
    A commendation meeting was held on July 2nd. At the meeting, Minister Li pointed out that some comrades in the past believed that comrades in government organs could not earn merit. This understanding is flawed. Whether it is the front-line troops or the rear organs, they can all earn merit, and the scope for earning merit is very broad. For example, Comrade Wu Youzhen, a cook, saved 120,000 silver dollars, which reduced the burden on the people by more than 120,000 silver dollars, which is also a contribution to the people. Through the meeting, everyone clarified the concept of earning merit and resolved to learn from the fifteen meritorious personnel.
    [Our Newspaper Shahe News] When the comrades of the Shahe County Government organs commemorated "July 1st," they discussed the current affairs in combination with their own thoughts and work, and also held the first merit evaluation and commendation campaign. At the beginning, they were divided into three groups to discuss each other. From the chat, they put forward the specific actions of the models that they thought had performed well in their work. For example, Comrade Cui Cong of the office grasped the entire material and the engraving of the small newspaper very tightly. Originally, it would take a day to engrave one edition of the small newspaper, but he sometimes did not sleep at noon and completed the task in half a day. Xu Benheng, in charge of the organ's production, developed from organizing oil mills, flour mills, and textile factories with very little capital, which completely supplied the county government's office expenses and subsidized food expenses. After such group discussions, they discussed in the general assembly, achieving a bottom-up selection and mass commendation. The commendation was very broad, not only for work merits, but also for all aspects such as study, production, conservation, and style. Even a little advantage should be put forward. For example, Comrade Erfu led the organ comrades to carry out agricultural production, taking the lead in carrying water and planting cotton, and was always active and responsible; cook Lao Zhou not only cooked well, but also took good care of guest meals and patients; Quartermaster Zhang Jiuchang not only regulated life, but also saved more than 1,000 jin of rice and wheat, which were all handed over to the public to support the front line; Correspondent Yang Erlin always did not spend all the rice tickets he should receive each time he set off, and no matter how much was left, he returned it completely to the public, etc., so that everyone with a skill would be commended. In the commendation, the commended comrades consciously reviewed their shortcomings. For example, Cui Congli said: "My study is not frequent enough, and some comrades say that I still have waste phenomena, the lamp head is big and does not save oil, and the love of public property is not enough, etc." In this way, not only did the commended comrades think that they were not perfect, but also played a great role in overcoming shortcomings. Finally, everyone realized that commending merit is a new style of promoting new heroism, and all comrades have set their merit-making plans, and they must strive to be models in all aspects of work and life, and make contributions to the people.

    风箱旁边整八年
    每年节约十二万
    吴有珍荣记头功
    沙河县府评功表模
    【本报讯】为了纪念“七一”，太行军区政治部以十天时间，评选半年来的功臣模范。选出十五位功臣，当选头名功臣的炊事员吴有珍同志，在风箱旁整整八年，工作始终如一，天不明即起，一天要烧十二锅水，有时间还帮助豆腐坊压豆子，由于他在拉风箱上有特殊的创造，每年节约煤炭洋十二万余元……。
    七月二号举行贺功大会，会上李部长指出过去有些同志认为机关同志不能立功，这种认识是有毛病的，无论是前方部队或后方机关都能立功，立功面是很宽的。如炊事员吴有珍同志节约十二万元，就是给人民减轻了十二万余元的负担，亦就是为人民立下了功劳。经过大会，大家明确了立功的观念，决心向十五位功臣学习。
    【本报沙河讯】沙河县政府机关全体同志纪念“七一”时，结合自己的思想和工作，讨论了当前的时事，又举行了初次的评功表模运动。开始是分成了三个小组，互相酝酿，从漫谈中，把自己认为工作表现好的模范具体行动都提出来，如办公室崔从同志对整个材料和刻小报抓的很紧，本来一天才能刻一版小报，但他有时中午不睡觉，半天就突击完成了。徐本恒掌握机关生产，以很少的资本，从组织油坊、粉坊、纺织工厂上发展起来，完全供给了县府的办公费和补助菜金。这样小组酝酿后又在大会讨论，作到了自下而上的评选和群众性的表扬。表扬的面很宽，不但是工作上的功劳，就是学习、生产、节约、作风等各方面，那怕有一点优点都要提出来。如二夫同志领导机关同志进行农业生产，带头担水点种棉花，一贯积极负责；伙夫老周除做好饭外，对客饭和病号都照顾的很好；事务长张九长同志除调剂了生活外，又节余了米麦各一千多斤，都交公支援了前线；通讯员杨二林同志每次出发应领的米票总是花不完，不管剩多少，回来完全交公等，这样作到了有一技之长都要受到表扬。在表扬中，被表扬的同志都自觉的检讨了自己的缺点，如崔从理说：“我的学习还不经常，还有些同志说咱还有浪费现象，灯头大不省油，对公物爱惜还很不够等等。”这样不但被表扬同志认为自己并不是尽善尽美，对克服缺点上也起了很大的作用。最后大家认识了表功是发扬新英雄主义的新作风，各位同志都订了立功计划，都要从工作生活等各方面争取模范，为民立功。（奎林）
