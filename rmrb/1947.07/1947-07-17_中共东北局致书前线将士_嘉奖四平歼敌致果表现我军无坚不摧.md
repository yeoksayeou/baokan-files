    CCP Northeast Bureau Sends Letter to Frontline Soldiers
    Commending the Victory of Annihilating the Enemy in Siping and Demonstrating the Invincibility of Our Army
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 11th] The Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued a letter to the commanders and fighters of various columns, stating: In the Siping campaign, our loyal soldiers demonstrated the invincible power of attacking fortified positions. After more than ten days and nights of fierce fighting, they destroyed the strong defense system of the Chiang army in Siping and annihilated more than 16,000 Chiang soldiers. Our army then maneuvered and withdrew from Siping, completely crushing the New Sixth Army's 14th Division and other reinforcement troops, annihilating more than 4,000 of them. This is a significant victory in the Northeast People's Self-Defense War. Through the summer offensive, our army has annihilated eight divisions of Chiang's main forces (including local troops, a total of ten full divisions), recovered vast areas, and liberated ten million people. The Fengji, Anfeng, and Jincheng line areas have been transformed from Chiang's army bases into our strategic areas, putting our army in a more advantageous position, thereby further increasing our army's favorable conditions for eliminating the Chiang army in the Northeast. This great victory has also effectively coordinated with the operations of the People's Liberation Army within the customs, directly weakening a large number of Chiang's troops in Rehe, Hebei, and other places, enabling our army in these areas to launch offensives smoothly. The Jicha ReLiao People's Liberation Army bravely cooperated with the Northeast Liberation Army's operations, annihilating a large number of Chiang and puppet troops, and recovering vast areas and many strategic points, which greatly excited and encouraged the people of Northeast China, further enhancing their confidence in victory, and also demoralizing the enemy, whose morale is increasingly declining.

    【新华社东北十一日电】中共中央东北局日前发表致各纵队指战员书，略称：在四平战役中，我军忠勇将士表现了无坚不摧的攻坚威力。经过十余昼夜的激战，摧毁了四平蒋军坚强防御体系，歼灭蒋军一万六千余人。我军当又机动撤出四平，全部击溃了新六军第十四师及其他的增援部队，歼灭其四千余人，这是东北人民自卫战争的重大胜利。经过夏季攻势，我军已歼灭了八个师的蒋军主力（连地方部队共达十个整师），收复了广大地区，解放了一千万人民。使奉吉、安奉、锦承等线地区，从蒋军基地，一变而成我军战略地区，使我军处于更有利的地位，因而更增加了我军消灭东北蒋军的有利的条件。这一伟大的胜利，并有效的配合关内人民解放军的作战，直接减弱了热河、河北等地的蒋军大批兵力，使这些地区的我军能够顺利发动攻势。冀察热辽人民解放军英勇配合东北解放军的作战，歼灭了大批蒋伪军，恢复了广大地区和许多战略要点，使东北人民兴奋鼓舞、更进一步提高了胜利信心，同时也使敌人落魄丧胆，士气愈益消沉。
