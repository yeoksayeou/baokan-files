How to Mobilize the Masses to Dig Canals?
	Lin Nan, Qi Chang, Shang Feng

	In the fight against drought and preparation for famine, various places in Taihang have launched a long-term anti-drought movement by building water conservancy projects one after another. Based on materials from Xingtai, Lincheng, Zanhuang, Cixian and other places, the following is an introduction to the experience of digging canals for your reference:

	The stumbling block to mobilizing and organizing the masses to build water conservancy projects is often the ideological obstacles left over from history. Therefore, it is necessary to eliminate these ideological obstacles from the very beginning. The spring water under Diaopan Mountain in Jiecun, Lincheng, was planned to be used to build a canal by the Kuomintang government before the war in the name of "benefiting the people." The result was that the "people-benefiting" official embezzled a huge amount of money, but said that water conservancy could not be repaired. This not only failed to complete the project, but also left the villagers with a very deep impression: "Everyone knows that this canal cannot be built." Therefore, when the idea of repairing this canal was proposed this year, the village cadres and the masses thought it was impossible. Later, after discussion and settlement of the past legacy, it was clarified that: "The Kuomintang government in the past only knew how to rule and exploit the people, and would never do things for the people; today's democratic government serves the masses, and leading the repair of the canal is also for us. If the whole village works together, it may be successful." One of the main ideological obstacles in Xingtai when mobilizing the masses to dig canals in Changxin Village was: "During the great drought in the ninth year of the Republic of China, other villages died, but our village still bought people. Because some wells irrigate the land, the harvest is bad in bad years, and the harvest is good in good years. We won't starve to death even if it doesn't rain." In response to this ideological obstacle, the leadership provided education on production and prosperity and support for the war. After discussion by the masses, action was taken.

	Secondly, ideological leadership must be implemented throughout the entire movement so that the movement does not get blocked. At the beginning of the canal digging in Changxin Village and Jiecun, a common idea was: they were both afraid that digging the canal would delay the work in the fields, and they were afraid that the canal would not be completed and they would waste their labor. The experience of Changxin Village in solving this ideological problem was, on the one hand, to mobilize women to go to the fields to watch the waterwheels and irrigate the land, so that more than 90 waterwheels were all put into operation, so that canal digging and irrigation were not delayed. On the other hand, in the process of canal digging, a method of digging a section of the canal and releasing a section of water was adopted to break the concept of being afraid of wasting labor with practical results.

	In addition, the experience in the organizational work of canal repair can be summarized into six points: (1) Form a strong leading group and a sound organizational structure. When repairing canals, Nanpingwang, Changxin and other villages all turned the production committee into a canal repair committee in order to concentrate efforts to lead the canal repair work. Under the Canal Repair Committee, Changxin Village combined with mutual aid groups and set up five brigades according to the five streets, with each brigade divided into several groups. Jiecun did not have a mutual aid organization. It first organized a water conservancy committee including the main cadres of the whole village. Under the leadership of this committee, it organized the masses of the whole village to dig canals. After the canal was completed, the whole village voluntarily organized twenty-one mutual aid groups. (2) Implement large-scale labor exchange and solve the land occupation problem. When Changxin Village was digging the canal, the masses raised the question: "What should be done if people who cannot irrigate the land participate?" "What should be done if there is no labor to irrigate the land?" After discussion, it was stipulated that points should be determined according to the strength of the labor force, work should be recorded according to the work done, and wages should be paid according to the land. Those who exceeded the work and those who could not irrigate the land would get wages, and the whole village would carry out large-scale labor exchange. When Guojia Kiln was digging the canal, the full male labor force topped 10 points per day, women 7 to 8 points, and children 4 to 6 points. It was also a large-scale labor exchange for the whole village, which solved the labor problem. The way Jiecun solved the problem of occupying land for canal repair was: 300 jin of rice for occupying one mu of first-class land, 200 jin for second-class land, and 100 jin for third-class land, which was摊(摊摊) by the irrigating households according to the mu. (3) Specifically organize the division of labor, cadres take the lead, and master the backbone. The Jiecun Water Conservancy Committee first divided the canal into several sections, and then organized the labor force of the whole village into several groups, divided according to the sections, and cadres and heroes participated in the groups separately, taking the lead in mastering, so that it was neither in a hurry nor wasted people's power. When Changxin Village was repairing the canal between Baita and Changxin, it encountered a 14-zhang-long section of white sand. The water flowed here and went underground. Everyone was at a loss. Some said: "I have nothing to eat at home, I want to sell rice." Some said, "I have nothing to burn at home, I want to collect firewood." Some suggested: "Repair the canal in the morning and go to the fields in the afternoon." At this time, the leadership put forward the slogan of "work hard day and night, complete it quickly." The cadres of the administrative office and the county also personally started working, which immediately strengthened the confidence and will of the masses and encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses. Immediately, more than 50 livestock and carts, as well as blacksmiths and carpenters, were mobilized. After a fierce assault for an afternoon, the white sand section was paved with stones, wood and stucco before dark, and the canal water was successfully released, and the enthusiasm of the masses rebounded again. (4) Commend models and increase enthusiasm. When Jiecun came back at night, it rated the work and recorded the work, and broadcasted and commended the best. Labor hero Li Chunzi moved stones even when he was sick and still topped half a person, thus encouraging and sustaining the enthusiasm of the masses for repairing the canal. (5) Establish a new system for managing water conservancy. After the canal is repaired, a water conservancy department will be set up in the production committee, which will be responsible by a dedicated person. After the Guanwan River Canal was repaired, the new system for managing water conservancy was: under the unified management of the Water Conservancy Department, the irrigation is generally carried out in order along the canal, regardless of whose land it is; the people who irrigate the land are dispatched by the mutual aid group in turn, according to the wages of the mutual aid group, whoever irrigates the land will pay. As for special crops that need more irrigation, water is also allocated uniformly. This saves both manpower and waterpower. (6) Pay attention to mass relations as soon as possible and solve disputes in a timely manner. In April, the three villages of Shabei, Nanxu, and Liufang in the first district had disputes with the two villages of Baiquan and Nanchang in Xingtai due to争(争争) water conservancy. Therefore, paying attention to water conservancy and timely resolving water conservancy disputes is indeed an important issue. When the masses of Hujiazhuang saw the people of Changxin Village coming to dig the canal, thirty or twenty people also intervened. After negotiation, they divided the water and irrigated 500 mu of land before it was over. This is an example of solving water disputes based on the principle of mutual benefit.

　　如何发动群众开渠？
    林南、其昌、尚枫
    在抗旱备荒中，太行各地前后开展兴办水利长期抗旱运动。兹根据邢台、临城、赞皇、磁县等地材料，将开渠经验介绍如下供各地参考：
    动员与组织兴办水利的绊脚石，往往首先是历史上遗留下来的思想障碍，因此，开始就必须扫除这种思想障碍才行。临城解村钓盘山下的那个泉水，战前国民党政府曾以“为民兴利”的美名，派大员带上巨款来计划修渠，结果这个“为民兴利”的大员贪污了巨款，却说水利不沾修不成。这样不但还未修成，倒给该村群众留下一个极深刻的印象：“大家都知道这渠修不成”。所以今年一提出修这道渠，村干部群众就认为根本不行。后来经过讨论，清算了过去的遗留问题，这才明确了：“过去国民党政府只会统治剥削人民，根本不会为人民办事；今天的民主政府是为群众服务的，领导修渠也是为了咱们，全村都下手也许沾。”邢台在长信村动员群众开渠时的主要思想障碍之一，则是：“民国九年大旱时，别村死人，我村还买人哩。因为有些井浇地，年景坏了坏收，年景好了好收，不下雨也饿不死”。针对着这个思想障碍，领导上给以生产发家与支援战争的教育，经群众讨论后，才行动起来。
    其次，思想领导必须贯彻在整个运动中，使运动不致受阻。长信村和解村的开渠之初，一个共同思想是：既怕开渠误了地里活，又怕开渠不成白误工。长信村解决这个思想问题的经验，一方面是动员了妇女上地看水车浇地，使九十多辆水车全部活动起来，做到开渠浇地两不误，另一方面，在开渠过程中采取了开一段渠放一段水的办法，用实际打破了怕白误工的观念。
    此外修渠组织工作上的经验，概括起来可分六点：（一）组成强有力的领导集团和一套健全的组织机构。南平旺、长信等村在修渠时，都是把生产委员会变成修渠委员会，以便集中力量领导修渠工作。长信村在修渠委员会之下，与互助组结合，按五条街设五个大队，队以下分若干小组。解村没有互助组织，是先组织了包括全村主要干部的水利委员会，在该会领导之下，把全村群众组织起来开渠，在渠开成之后，全村就自愿结合的组织起二十一个互助组。（二）实行大变工及解决占地问题。长信村开渠时，群众提出：“浇不上地的人参加怎办？”“浇地没劳力的怎办？”经讨论规定：按劳力强弱定分，按活记工，按地出工资，出工超过者及出工浇不上地的人得工资，实行全村大变工。郭家窑开渠时，男全劳力每天顶十分，妇女七分至八分，儿童四分至六分，也是实行全村大变工，解决了劳力的困难。解村解决修渠占地的办法是：占一亩头等地三百斤米，二等地二百斤，三等地一百斤，由浇地户按地亩摊。（三）具体组织分工，干部带头，掌握骨干。解村水利委员会，先把渠分成若干段，又把全村劳力组成若干小组，按段划开，干部英雄分头参加到组里去，带头掌握，既不忙乱又不浪费民力。长信村的修渠修至白塔与长信间遇到十四丈长的白沙段时，水流至此钻入地下去了。大家束手无策，有的说：“家里没吃的，我要去粜米”。有的说“家里没烧的，要去打柴”。有的提议：“上午修渠，下午上地”。这时候，领导上提出：“星夜干，快完成”的口号，无论行署及县区上的干部也都亲自动起手来，即时坚定了群众的信心和意志，鼓舞了群众情绪，当即动员了五十多个牲口和大车以及铁匠木匠，猛烈的突击了一个下午，赶黑就用石头木板和三合土，铺过这个白沙段，渠水顺利放过，群众情绪又复高涨。（四）表扬模范，提高热情。解村每天黑了回来，评分记工，把最好的予以广播表扬。劳英李春子带病搬石头还顶半个人，因而鼓舞与持续了群众的修渠热情。（五）建立一套管理水利的新制度。在水渠修成之后，生产委员会内设立一个水利部，由专人负责。关湾河渠修成后，管理水利的新制度是：在水利部统一管理之下，一般都是顺渠而下，不分谁家地，顺序按片浇灌；浇地的人由互助组轮派，按互助组的工资为标准，谁浇地谁出。至于特种作物需多浇，也是统一拨水。这样既省人力又省水力。（六）及早注意群众关系并及时解决纠纷。四月间，一分区沙河北俎、南俎、六方三村，曾与邢台百泉、南厂两村因争水利酿成纠纷，因此注意水利互得及时解决水利纠纷确是一个重要问题。胡家庄群众一见长信村人来开渠，三二十人也插了手，商谈结果分水浇地五百亩才了事。这是一个本着互利原则解决争水纠纷的例子。
