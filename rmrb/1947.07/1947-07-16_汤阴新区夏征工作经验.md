Experience in Summer Grain Collection Work in the New District of Tangyin

After the liberation of Tangyin City on May 1st, the new liberated area of Tangyin County increased by six administrative districts and more than one hundred and eighty administrative villages. These villages, following the joyous upsurge of the new liberation and the vigorous development of the emancipation movement, also rapidly and smoothly completed the task of collecting ××× stone of wheat in the summer harvest work from May 29th to June 7th in eight or nine days. Through the burden work, they mobilized the masses and won their love and support for us. It is a great achievement to be able to do this in the newly liberated area in a short period of time. Their methods are:

	I. Correctly implemented the burden policy and simple burden methods:

The summer grain collection work in the newly liberated area of Tangyin implemented a simple burden method in every village that deducted population consumption and progressed cumulatively according to acreage, completely breaking down the unfair practice of apportioning burdens according to taels of silver, land, and head tax that had existed for thousands of years. In terms of burden, it struck at feudal landlords and united more than 80% of the farmers. The burden coverage in the whole county was about 50%. According to the statistics of 38 villages in the fifth district, the burden coverage was 58.5%, and the statistics of 19 villages in the seventh district showed that it was 47.5%. About half of the masses were not within the burden, so they reflected: "No emperor in the past could avoid paying grain, but today there is actually a world where you don't have to pay grain." More than 30% of the middle-peasant households who bear the burden have a light and fair burden. Their general response is: "This year we can relax a little. The Eighth Route Army must not leave." They are also brewing the idea that the large households who paid less, owed or did not pay in previous years will now have to watch out. It's time for a change, and they won't bend them.

Because we correctly implemented the simple burden method, the masses showed heartfelt support. Therefore, they were very active in handing over public grain. Even the collection, transportation, and preservation of grain were completed in three days of blitz. Many exemplary cases emerged. Emancipated farmers played an exemplary leading role in handing over grain. The chairman of the Gongguantun Farmers' Association led the members to collectively cut the wheat of the fleeing landlords, thresh it, dry it, and hand it over as public grain. Jiang Yin, who was blind, heard that he had to hand over public grain, so he carried a bushel of wheat to hand it over. The cadre said: "You don't have to bear the burden, why do you hand over grain?" He said: "First the capital and then the profit. The Eighth Route Army eats our grain and protects our good times, so we should hand over some voluntarily." We proposed to hand over dry grain and good grain, and the masses said: "You are really overthinking, you don't need to calculate this for us." The masses in Zhang Village automatically discussed and stipulated three things that should not be handed over as public grain (not dry, not full, not clean). Many villages organized grain delivery teams, and only after drying on the field, winnowing with wooden shovels, and inspection by cadres were they approved. Also, in terms of grain transportation, there were many innovations: In Dapo Village, District 8, the carts did not return and were not enough. The members of the Farmers' Association automatically gathered more than 70 people to carry and deliver them. The cadre said: "Wait for the carts to come back and transport them." They said: "If you don't let us pay public grain, will you still not let us deliver public grain?" Zhang Village and other villages cherished public grain and tore down quilts to sew pockets to ensure that public grain was not lost. From these facts, we can see that the burden work has initially laid a foundation among the masses, and the masses have shown their love for our government. At the same time, it also confirms that the understanding that "in the new district, it is enough to start the burden in a simple way, without paying attention to certain methods, fearing that the masses will not be able to grasp it, and fearing that it will delay time" is incorrect. Because the masses in the new district have improved their awareness faster, they urgently demand fairness and rationality under the long-term unlimited extortion and unfair conscription rule of the Kuomintang. Our implementation of reasonable and simple burden methods meets the needs of the masses. Therefore, we should clearly realize that the burden method itself is mobilization for the masses. If we avoid trouble and simplify it, it is a purely task-oriented viewpoint and ignores financial recommendations.

	II. The burden work mobilized the masses.

The accuracy of population and land is the basic key to whether the burden is fair or not. When mobilizing cadres and the masses, it was proposed that: large households conceal, small households suffer, collusion and concealment, and small households also suffer. The requirements and determination to examine population and land were established, so the masses put forward struggle slogans and came up with struggle methods. For example, the masses in Muqiu Village, District 8, beat gongs in the streets and shouted: If you hide it from the Eighth Route Army, you hide it from the government, but you can't hide it from the villagers. Quickly report the truth. Some villages proposed: If you hide land, the Farmers' Association will cut your wheat. A general warning to the landlords: The Eighth Route Army handles things seriously and says one thing is one thing. If you hide and underreport, you won't get away with it. Dazhanggai Village, District 6, created a method for landlords to report land, sign, and put fingerprints, and be responsible for errors, and stepped out 400 acres of land. In the mobilization meeting in Dahuang Village, they carried a measuring bow and said: Whoever does not report truthfully will be measured and punished. All villages generally organized evaluation meetings and investigation teams, which greatly restricted the landlords from making trouble, and made the land close to and relatively certain.

Handing over public grain is the obligation of the people. Let the masses understand: "The Eighth Route Army struggles hard and lives frugally for the sake of the people. The Eighth Route Army eats the people's grain to eliminate the enemy and protect everyone's good times; therefore, the burden of the Eighth Route Army is light, and the people are happy to bear the burden." And revealed that the Kuomintang was corrupt, greedy, and enjoying themselves, regardless of the life and death of the people, and eating the people's food in turn to kill the people. At the same time, the specific accounting method was used to compare the burdens of the enemy and us to enlighten the masses. For example, Gongguantun in District 6 had 115 households in the whole village, with 1,085 acres of land. Last year, the Kuomintang forcibly collected more than 138,000 catties of rice and wheat, and 7,201 catties of cotton, which was equivalent to 50,409 catties of rice, totaling more than 188,000 catties (firewood and vegetable money were not included). Since then, the masses have realized who is for the people and who is harming the people, so they consciously handed over the grain quickly to support the self-defense war.

The burden is closely integrated with the mass movement, the collection work is completed by surprise, the struggle continues, and through the consolidation of the burden work, the masses clarify the class and recognize the landlords even more. Struggle is carried out in the burden, or problems are brewed and discussed. For example, Fan Yun, the Bao chief of Houzhonggui, is a landlord. Not only did he not hand over the public grain he should have, but he was the first to send the masses one catty of wheat per mu to supply the office staff of the village office, and mobilized several landlords to hide the carts, saying that the army had used them up and there was nothing to deliver. The masses recognized his ghost face and detained him. Several landlords in Bata Village resisted grain and delayed handing it over, so the masses first irrigated the grain of two households, forming a mass seizure of public grain,打击了頑抗地主，教育了一般地主打 struck at stubborn landlords and educated general landlords. A landlord in Village × in District 5 underreported land, and the masses immediately launched a struggle against him, saying that now under the leadership of the democratic government, you are still fooling us. When the Central Army was here in the past, you still don't know how much you bullied the people, and you resolutely want him to spit out things. In this way, the masses were mobilized to fight against the landlords, increasing the masses' hatred of the landlords.

	III. Several experiences in the burden work in the new district:

	(1) Conduct in-depth ideological mobilization and extensive policy education.

The masses in the new district do not understand our policies under the deceitful propaganda and agent rumors of the Kuomintang, so we must widely conduct policy education so that the masses understand our proposition. Tangyin New District conducted the following content in mobilization:

	1. Publicize the current victory, and use the actual situation in Tangyin to explain that Chiang Kai-shek is going downhill, we want to counterattack, and the people want to rule the world. Specifically explain that Shi Huasheng and Hu Quanlu were eliminated, and all traitors and bullies will be punished by the people. At the same time, it instructed that when attacking Tangyin, after annihilating 13,000 Chiang troops in Qijun, the reinforcements did not dare to come. Sun Dianying, Wang Zhonglian, and Chiang Kai-shek were anxious and there was nothing they could do. This fully illustrates that Chiang Kai-shek has no strength, our army has the initiative, Chiang Kai-shek is going to die, and we are going to win, which is definitely beyond doubt, and strengthens the masses' confidence in victory.

	2. Severely criticize the Kuomintang's unfair method of bearing burdens according to land and silver. And emphasize that due to the unfair burden method, the peasants suffered the tragic fate of rolling up their bedding, knocking down tile vats, selling villages and land, starving to death and fleeing from famine, and families were destroyed. This, ideologically and practically, broke down the unfair method that had been oppressing the people for thousands of years and enlightened the masses.

	3. Publicize the spirit of our burden policy and method, which is that those with more money should pay more, those with less money should pay less, and those with no money should not pay. And emphasize and publicize who we reward and who we take care of, so the masses responded to us: "The Eighth Route Army's method is brilliant and well-organized."

Because the above three points of education were carried out, which enlightened the masses to support the war, break down the old methods, and establish a new system consciously, the task was turned into the masses' requirements, and the action was particularly powerful. After the masses in Yang Village were mobilized at the meeting, everyone shouted: "Thirteenth and fourteenth, hurry up to the field, fifteenth and sixteenth, hand over the public grain, support the Eighth Route Army, and drive away Chiang Kai-shek's army!"

	(2) Grasp the core and hand over the methods and tasks to cadres and the masses.

Without class leadership, class undertakings cannot be done. The leadership is very clear about this concept. Therefore, under the circumstances of the new district, the county held a joint meeting of district chiefs and financial and grain assistants, and absorbed all the cadres who participated in the summer harvest work, made a profound mobilization, and conducted specific and comprehensive research. All districts convened training classes, emphasizing the absorption of active masses below the middle peasants to participate, mobilizing the great power of 1,134 cadres trained throughout the county, handing over the task to the village, and each village generally held a meeting to conduct mobilization and propaganda, so that everyone knows our propositions and methods. The masses, who have mastered legitimate methods, have weapons, so they actively act to require fairness in the burden.

	(3) Carry out the meritorious competition movement to promote the rapid completion of the burden work.

In the training class, all villages were called to start a meritorious competition, and the prize flag was hung in the center of the venue, with the words "Model Village for Grain Collection" and "Just Cadres" written on it, which greatly encouraged the masses to win the flag. District 6 also proposed the slogan "Strive to win the flagpole is like winning an election", and all villages were unwilling to lag behind. The village chief of Dongmufu Village said on the spot that he would win the flag of justice cadre. When summarizing the burden, this flag was indeed won by them, and the high morale of the masses can be seen in general. Therefore, a large number of model cadres and justice cadres emerged at the burden summary meetings in each district. At the summary meeting in District 6 alone, there were 2 special-class models, 10 first-class models, 14 second-class models, and 7 third-class models, totaling 33 people. The county also took out 90,000 yuan in bonuses and awarded them to various districts.

	(4) Unify leadership and regard the collection work as a temporary central task.

Tangyin's experience is that the summer harvest and summer collection are closely integrated. In the rush harvest, it is proposed that: "We must fight against the enemy, we must fight against God, and half a year's harvest lies in today." It calls on "men, women, old and young to work together, harvest quickly, beat quickly, hide quickly, beat quickly, dry quickly, and hand over grain quickly." Zhang Village and other villages in District 6 are "threshing at night, drying grain during the day, or organizing households that hand over public grain to thresh first." Generally, they "thresh the wheat and hand it over in the field without carrying it home." They said: "Hand it over in the field! It saves time from being mistaken at home. The Eighth Route Army takes as much as it should, unlike Chiang Kai-shek's army that robs us." Therefore, the completion of all aspects of the burden quickly and thoroughly is due to the unity of leadership, consistent understanding, and consistent action, and the summer harvest work is regarded as a temporary central task, and the task is completed in the spirit of surprise.

    汤阴新区夏征工作经验
    五月一日汤阴城解放后，汤阴县新解放区增加了六个行政区，一百八十余个行政村，这些村里继新解放的欢腾热潮及猛烈开展了翻身运动，在五月二十九日至六月七日八九天中，又在夏屯工作上，迅速顺利的完成×××石麦子的征收任务，并通过负担工作，发动了群众，获得群众对我们的热爱与拥护。在解放不久的新区能做到这步程度，实在是个莫大的成就。他们的做法是：
            一、正确的执行了负担政策和简易的负担办法：
    汤阴新解放区的夏季征收工作，是村村执行了扣除人口消耗，按亩累进的简易负担办法，彻底打垮了几千年来按银两、地亩、丁洋等负担不公的摊派做法，并在负担上打击了封建地主，团结了百分之八十以上的农民；全县负担面，均在百分之五十左右，据五区三十八个村的统计，负担面是百分之五十八·五，七区十九个村统计，是百分之四十七·五，约有半数群众不在负担之内，因而他们反映：“历来任何皇上坐了不能不纳粮，今天居然有了不纳粮的天下”。百分之三十以上的出负担中农户，负担轻而公道，他们的普遍反映是：“今年可松松肩吧，八路军千万不敢走了”。并酝酿着往年大户少交、欠交或不交，今年可瞧瞧他们的看吧，该着换班了，不屈他们。
    由于我们正确执行了简易负担办法，群众表现了衷心的拥护，所以在交公粮上都很自动，连征收和运粮及保存，均在三天内突击完成，并出现了很多模范事例，交粮中翻身农民起模范带头作用。公官屯农会主席带领农会员集体去割回逃亡地主的麦子来打了晒干交公粮。瞎子江印听说交公粮，也背了一斗麦子去交，干部说：“你不用出负担，为啥交粮”？他说：“先本后利，八路军吃了粮给咱保护时光，应该自动交些”。我们提出要交干粮好粮，群众说：“你们实在多心，这不用你们结计。”张庄群众即自动讨论订出公粮三不交（不干、不饱、不净）。很多村组织交粮小组，经过场上晒，木锨扬，干部验，才算批准。又如在运粮上，也有不少创举：八区大坡村大车没回来不够用，农会员自动集合起七十余人去担送，干部说：“等大车回来运吧”，他们说：“不叫俺出公粮吧，还不叫俺送公粮”。六区大张盖村完成自己运粮后，又帮助南北土场二村运粮，张庄等村爱护公粮，拆了被子缝口袋，保证公粮不损失。从这些事实都可以看到负担工作已在群众中初步打下基础，群众表现了对我政府的热爱，同时也证实了“新区里用简单方式，起了负担就行，不用讲究一定的办法，怕群众掌握不了，怕耽误时间”的认识是不正确的。因为新区群众觉悟提高较快，他们在长期的国民党无限度的敲榨和不公道的征派统治下，迫切要求公平合理，我们执行合理的简易负担办法后，正切合了群众的需要，因此我们应明确认识，负担办法本身对群众就是动员，如果避烦就简，就是单纯的任务观点，忽视了财政建议。
            二、负担工作发动了群众。
    人口土地之确实是负担公平与否的基本关键。在对干部和群众动员时，提出了：大户隐瞒，小户吃亏，通同隐瞒，也是小户吃亏。树立了蹬展人口土地的要求和决心，因而群众提出了斗争口号，想出了斗争办法。如八区木秋村群众，在街打锣高喊：瞒了八路军，瞒了政府，瞒不了咱村老百姓，赶快以实报实。有的村提出：隐瞒土地，农会要割他的麦子。普遍的警告地主：八路军办事认真，说一不二，隐瞒少报，就过不去。六区大张盖村，创造了地主报土地，要签名盖手印，错了负责的办法，蹬出土地四○○余亩。大荒村在动员大会上扛着丈地步弓说：谁不报确实，丈出来受处分。各村都普遍的组织评议会，调查组，这样大大限制了地主捣鬼，使土地接近与比较确实。
    交公粮是老百姓的义务，让群众认识：“八路军艰苦奋斗，节衣缩食，是为了老百姓，八路军吃上老百姓的粮食是消灭敌人，保卫大家好时光；因而八路军负担就轻，老百姓出负担就痛快”。并揭露了国民党贪污腐化发财享乐不顾人民死活，吃上老百姓的，反过来杀害老百姓，同时用具体算账方法拿敌我负担对比，来启发群众觉悟，如六区公官屯，全村一一五户，地一○八五亩，去年国民党强征米麦十三万八千余斤，棉花七千二百零一斤，折米五○四○九斤，共计十八万八千余斤，（柴草款菜均不在内）。从此群众认识了谁为老百姓，谁害老百姓，所以在交粮时都自觉为支援自卫战争而迅速的交。
    负担紧密结合群运，征收工作突击完成，斗争继续开展，并通过负担工作的整顿，群众明确了阶级，更认清了地主，在负担中开展斗争，或酝酿讨论问题。如后中贵保长范云是个地主，自己应出的公粮不但未交，而且首先给群众每亩地派麦子一斤，来供村公所的办公人员吃，并发动几户地主，把车藏起来，说军队用完了，没啥送。群众认清他的鬼脸，把他扣起来。霸台村几户地主抗粮拖延不交，群众就先去灌了两户的粮食，形成群众性的起公粮，打击了顽抗地主，教育了一般地主。五区×村地主，少报土地，群众马上向他开展斗争，提出现在民主政府领导，你还捉弄我们，过去中央军在，你还不知欺侮了多少老百姓，坚决要他吐出东西，这样发动了群众对地主的斗争，增加了群众对地主的憎恨。
            三、新区负担工作上几点经验：
    （一）深入思想动员广泛的进行政策教育。
    新区群众在国民党的欺骗宣传和特务造谣的环境下，对我们政策不了解，所以我们必须广泛的进行政策教育，让群众了解我们的主张。汤阴新区在动员上，进行内容如下：
    １、宣传目前胜利，以汤阴的现实情况，说明蒋介石走下坡路，我们要反攻，老百姓要坐天下，具体说明史华生、扈全禄被消灭，所有汉奸恶霸都要受到人民的惩处，同时指示打汤阴时，在淇浚歼灭蒋军一万三千人后，援军不敢来了，孙殿英、王仲廉、蒋介石，着急也没办法，这样充分说明蒋介石没有力量，我军掌握主动权，蒋介石要死亡，我们要胜利，是肯定无疑的了，坚定了群众的胜利信心。
    ２、严斥国民党按地亩、银两负担不公的办法。并强调说明由于负担办法不公道，农民遭到了卷铺盖、倒瓦缸、卖庄卖地、饿死逃荒家破人亡的悲惨命运，这样在思想上做法上，打垮了几千年压在人民头上的不公办法，启发了群众自觉。
    ３、宣传我们负担政策办法的精神，是钱多多出，钱少少出，无钱不出。并把我们奖励那些、照顾那些，强调宣传，因而群众对我们反映是“八路军办法高明，头头是道”。
    由于进行了以上三点教育，启发了群众支援战争，打垮旧办法，建立新制度的自觉，所以把任务变成了群众的要求，行动起来特别有力。杨村群众在开会动员后，大家喊着：“十三十四快打场，十五十六交公粮，拥护八路军，打走蒋家军！”
    （二）掌握核心，把办法和任务交给干部和群众。
    没有阶级的领导，办不出阶级的事业，领导对这个观念很明确，因此在新区情况下，县里召开了区长财粮助理员联席会议，并吸收参加夏屯工作的所有干部，作了深刻的动员，与具体的通盘研究后，各区都召集了训练班，强调吸收中农以下积极群众参加，发动全县集训干部一一三四名的伟大力量，把任务交给村，各村又普遍开了大会，进行了动员和宣传，使人人都知道我们的主张和办法，群众掌握合法的办法，有了武器，所以积极行动起来，要求把负担办公道。
    （三）开展立功竞赛运动，推动负担工作迅速完成。
    在训练班号召各村展开立功竞赛，会场中央并悬挂奖旗，大书征粮模范村和公正干部，发动群众夺旗，直接对群众鼓舞很大。六区并提出“争取夺旗杆好比中个举”的鼓动口号，各村都不甘落后，东木佛村长当场表示，要夺取公正干部旗。总结负担时，这杆旗果然被他们夺了，群众情绪的高涨可见一般，所以各区总结负担会上都涌现了大批模范干部，和公正干部，仅六区总结时就有特等模范二人，一等十人，二等十四人，三等七人共三十三人，县里又拿了九万元的奖金，奖给各区。
    （四）一元化领导，把征收工作当作临时中心工作。
    汤阴的经验是夏收和夏征紧密结合，在抢收中提出：“要和敌人作斗争要和老天作斗争，半年收成在于今朝”，号召“男女老幼齐动手，快收快打快快藏，快打快晒快交粮。”六区张庄等村就是“夜间打场，白天晒粮，或组织交公粮户先打场”。普遍的都是“打下麦子不往家扛，在场晒干交公粮”。他们说：“在场交吧！省得往家里错误时间，八路军是该多少要多少，不象蒋家军抢咱的”。所以在负担各方面能够迅速而彻底的完成，是由于一元化的领导上，认识一致，行动一致，把夏收工作当作临时的中心工作，以突击的精神完成任务。
