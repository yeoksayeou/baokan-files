Xinhua News Agency, Frontline, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 21st: In this battle to annihilate Chiang Kai-shek's troops of the reorganized 32nd Division and reorganized 70th Division, the People's Liberation Army descended from the sky like an eagle catching chicks, catching the Chiang Kai-shek troops off guard. Our frontline reporter reported the situation at the time, saying: Chiang Kai-shek's deployment this time was to place three reorganized divisions inexplicably on a straight line in the southeast of Ju'ye and the northwest of Jinxiang, with the 70th Division in the northern Liuyingji, the 32nd Division in the middle Dushanji, and the 66th Division in the southern Yangshanji, with intervals of about 20 to 30 li. The People's Liberation Army marched forcibly overnight, completing the great encirclement at 6:00 on the 12th, cutting the Chiang Kai-shek troops of the three divisions into three pieces. The Central News Agency's Zhengzhou telegram on the 14th said: General Liu's troops, after crossing the river, "wandered aimlessly, sometimes east, sometimes west." This precisely illustrates that they knew nothing about the actions of the People's Liberation Army. By the time the Chiang Kai-shek troops realized they were surrounded, it was too late. Chiang's Ministry of National Defense urgently ordered the 70th Division to the south and the 66th Division to the north, to close in with the 32nd Division to avoid annihilation. But firstly, it was actually impossible; secondly, Dushanji was too small to accommodate three divisions, and there was no way to get food and fodder. Therefore, the order was changed, and the 70th and 32nd Divisions were ordered to shrink southwards first to relieve the siege of the 66th Division in Yangshanji. The 32nd Division was also ordered to go north to Liuyingji to meet the 70th Division and everyone would leave together. The 32nd Division was partially annihilated on its way north, and the rest were routed. When they arrived at Liuyingji and met the 70th Division, they were already in ruins. Liuyingji was also not a large place, and the problem of food and fodder was extremely serious. Wang Jingjiu issued another order for them to quickly relieve the siege of Yangshan, but the 32nd and 70th Divisions were also under siege and had to break through. According to Chen Yiding, commander of the 70th Division, they originally wanted to break through directly to the south, but the depth was too long and they had absolutely no confidence. So they decided to break through to the east, attempting to first meet at Zhifangji, 20 li directly east of Liuyingji. The 30th Division was on the left flank and the 70th Division was on the right flank, and they broke through on the evening of the 14th. The People's Liberation Army immediately launched a fierce attack, first fighting fiercely between Yangliuqiao and Liuyingji. The Chiang Kai-shek troops were in chaos, and the mountain artillery on the pack animals could not be unloaded in time, completely losing their ability to resist. Officers and soldiers threw down their weapons one after another, and they robbed the quartermaster departments of the two division headquarters. In an area about ten li long, new legal tender was scattered everywhere; Chiang Kai-shek's two reorganized divisions were thus completely annihilated. The Central News Agency's Kaifeng telegram on the 14th said: Liu Bocheng's troops had been captured by the "National Army" between Ju'ye and Jinxiang. On the 18th, it was broadcast that General Liu Bocheng's army was溃不成军 (in utter defeat) and that the "National Army" had won an unprecedented victory. When the reporter asked Chen Yiding, commander of the 70th Division, what he thought of this, his face immediately flushed and he quickly said: "The Central News Agency never tells the truth, and none of us believe it."

　　钜野东南大歼灭战经过
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线二十一日电】此次歼灭蒋军整三十二师与整七十师之战，解放军象老鹰捉小鸡一样，从天而降，使蒋军措手不及。本社前线记者报导当时的情形称：蒋军这次布署是把三个整编师莫名其妙的摆在钜野东南与金乡西北的一条直线上，七十师在北面的六营集，三十二师在中间的独山集，六十六师在南面的羊山集，彼此间隔约为二十至三十华里。解放军连夜强行军，于十二日六时完成大包围，把三个师的蒋军切成三块。中央社十四日郑州电说：刘将军所部渡河以后，“忽东忽西，流窜无定。”正是说明对解放军的行动一点也不知道。等到蒋军发觉被围，已经太迟了。蒋记国防部急令七十师向南，六十六师向北，和三十二师靠在一起，以免覆灭。但一来事实上已不可能；二来独山集太小，摆不下三个师，粮秣更无办法，所以改令七十师、三十二师都向南缩，首先解羊山集六十六师之围，并令三十二师在向北到六营集去接七十师，大家一同走。三十二师在向北的途中，便被歼灭了一部，其余的被击溃。当他们到六营集和七十师会合的时候，已是残破不堪了。六营集地方也不大，粮秣问题极其严重，王敬久又传令叫他们速解羊山之围，三十二师、七十师自己也在包围之中，非突围不可。据七十师师长陈谈：他们本想直接向南突，但纵深太长，绝对没有把握，所以决心向东突，企图先到六营集正东二十里的纸坊集会合。三十师在左翼，七十师在右翼，于十四号晚间突围。解放军随即发动猛攻，首先在杨柳桥、六营集之间激战，蒋军大乱，山炮驮在牲口上都来不及解下来，完全丧失抵抗能力，官兵们纷纷放下枪支，把他们两个师部的军需处大抢一番。约莫十里长的地区、到处散乱着崭新的法币；蒋介石的两个整编师就这样全军覆灭了。中央社十四日开封电说：刘伯承所部已在钜野、金乡间为“国军”捕捉，十八日又广播说：刘伯承将军溃不成军，“国军”获得空前大捷。记者以此询问七十师师长陈颐鼎有何感想，他的面孔立即涨得通红，连忙说：“中央社从来不谈真话，我们谁也不相信它。”
