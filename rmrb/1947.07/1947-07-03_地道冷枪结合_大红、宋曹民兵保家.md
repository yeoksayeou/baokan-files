Combining Tunnel Warfare and Sniping
　Da Hong and Song Cao Militias Defend Their Homes
[Reported by this newspaper] The Taihang First Military Sub-district Military Commission recently issued a special commendation for the Da Hong and Song Cao militias for carrying out tunnel warfare and sniping to strike the enemy. On May 30th, over a thousand enemies from Yuanshi City, divided into eight groups, came to the seventh district of Yuanshi to loot. Da Hong village militiamen Zhang Zhongqiu and Li Hongzi, in order to protect the interests of the masses and complete their plan to kill the enemy, calmly led three militiamen into the tunnel, climbed to the places with gun holes. There were ten enemies looting, Zhang Zhongqiu aimed and shot one enemy dead. The enemy, not knowing where the bullet came from, shouted, "Who had a misfire?" Then Li Hongzi wounded two enemies, and the enemy fled in panic. On the 31st, over a thousand enemies from Yuanshi City, with artillery support, came to the seventh district to loot again. Six Song Cao militiamen persisted in attacking the enemy from the rooftop fortifications. The enemy concentrated firepower to charge, and our militiamen entered the bunkers to strike the enemy, killing and wounding several enemies. The enemy, enraged, dug into the bunkers and tried to smoke them out with fire. Our underground works were fully prepared and were not afraid of the smoke, suffering no losses. In the above two battles, we suffered no casualties, developing the tactics of combining village warfare with sniping, fortifications, and tunnels to strike the enemy and protect the grain. All counties in the border area can study and discuss this in light of local conditions and learn from the Da Hong and Song Cao militias.
　[Another report] On the evening of May 22nd, more than ten Yuanshi secret agents attempted to raid Zhang Village, west of Gaoyi City. As soon as they reached the edge of the village, they fell into our landmine network. With a series of loud explosions, seven landmines were detonated, scattering the secret agents, who fled back with bloodied heads. These bad elements, while moving between Da Chen Village and Bei Yan, were ambushed by one of our units. We captured four alive, seizing one rifle and eighty rounds of ammunition. The escapees, running to Sizhuang (two li east of the city), fell into the landmine array of our Gaoyi Flying Explosive Team, with three more explosions. The surviving enemies limped back to the city, scorched and crippled. (Zhu Jiong)

　　地道冷枪结合
  　大红、宋曹民兵保家
    【本报讯】太行一分区武委会，顷特通令表扬开展地道冷枪战打击敌人的大红、宋曹民兵，五月卅日，元氏城敌千余分八股到元氏七区抢劫，大红村民兵张中秋、李红子为了保护群众利益与完成杀敌计划，很沉着的带领了三个民兵钻入地道，爬到有枪眼的地方，有十个敌人正在抢劫，张中秋瞄准一枪击毙一敌，敌不知子弹从何而至，大叫“谁走了火”？接着李红子打伤两敌，敌慌忙逃窜。三十一日元氏城敌千余附炮又到七区掠劫，宋曹六个民兵在房上工事里坚持击敌，敌集中火力冲锋，我民兵就进入地堡打击敌人，毙伤敌数名，敌恼羞成怒，挖地堡用火薰，我地下工事有充分准备，并不怕熏，没受一点损失。以上两次战斗我毫无伤亡，发扬了村落战的冷枪工事地道互相结合的战术，打击敌人，保卫了粮食，边地各县可结合当地情况加以研究讨论，向大红、宋曹的民兵学习。
    【又讯】五月二十二日晚，元氏特务十余人，偷袭我高邑城西之张村，刚走到村外，即陷入我地雷网。轰轰隆隆的一连踏响七个地雷，炸的该特务，血淋淋的抱头回窜。这些坏蛋走到大陈庄与北岩之间，又中了我某部的埋伏，被我活捉了四个，缴了步枪一支，子弹八十发。漏网的跑到寺庄（城东二里地）又陷入了我高邑飞行爆炸队的地雷阵，连响三声，残敌真是焦身烂腿的狼狈回城。（朱炯）
