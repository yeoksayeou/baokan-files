　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 19th—The Shandong Provincial Government recently announced its policy towards Kuomintang personnel during the self-defense counter-offensive. The main points are as follows: (1) Those who have been deceived or forced to join the "Home Return Corps" or the Kuomintang army should promptly register for self-renewal with the democratic government or contact the democratic government to avoid unnecessary sacrifices during the counter-offensive. (2) Those who have been forced to join the political organizations of the Kuomintang army are allowed to atone for their crimes with meritorious service after self-renewal. Those who have merit and no fault, or whose merit outweighs their fault, shall have their citizenship restored, and enjoy the right to vote and stand for election, with the approval of the local masses and the government. If the person is a member of the basic masses and has no guilt, they shall enjoy the right to be allocated land. (3) For those who desert the Kuomintang army or are Kuomintang military and political personnel who come over, the village governments and the masses in various regions should provide proper hospitality. If the examination proves to be true, they will be introduced to the "Kuomintang Army Reception Center" of the county government and the commissioner's office. Those who carry weapons will be rewarded according to the "Reward Standards of the East China People's Liberation Army for Those Who Come Over with Weapons," or introduced to work, or given travel expenses to return home. (4) Whenever the Kuomintang army is defeated by the People's Liberation Army, its scattered soldiers, regardless of officers or soldiers, as long as they lay down their weapons, the militia and the masses should protect them uniformly, guide them to the residence of the liberated area government, and not confiscate their personal belongings. (5) Landlords who have been deceived into joining the "Home Return Corps" without any guilt and have no way to live in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are allowed to return to their hometowns and renew themselves. The villagers' meeting shall, based on the amount of work they did for the people before the recovery, be allowed to retain the land and property necessary for their livelihood. (6) Landlords and Kuomintang staff who remained neutral or sympathized with the military and civilians in the liberated areas during the Kuomintang occupation and actively sheltered our personnel, in addition to land being subject to the laws and policies of the democratic government, shall enjoy other preferential treatment. (7) Those who are determined to be enemies of the people and have committed all kinds of evil during the Kuomintang occupation will have their land confiscated. After being reported, they may be suggested by the mass accusation meeting and the public trial meeting, and reported to the judicial organs above the county level for punishment according to the severity of their crimes.
