(Our newspaper's Ji'nan dispatch of the 11th) The Seventh District of Shen County has seen through the landlords' plot to feign poverty, pursued "underground treasure," overcome the "no more to struggle" mentality, and discovered that landlords own many "entrusted estates," which were immediately confiscated. After the district pursued and annihilated the landlords before and after the wheat harvest, it seemed on the surface that the landlords' land had been struggled against, and their lives had deteriorated. Zhang Chengxin, a landlord in Zhongxinge, was still eating black cornbread (sorghum flour) during the wheat harvest this year, showing a distressed and difficult situation, leading some people to mistakenly say, "There is nothing more to struggle against." However, a few days ago, 450 catties of wheat, a large jar, and a canister of silver were unearthed from the basement of the landlord's house in Huangzhuanglou. After discussion between the cadres and the masses, it was decided to investigate Zhang Chengxin again. The sub-district cadres then led the masses to his home to dig up underground treasure. Seven hundred and thirty silver dollars were unearthed from under the foundation of the wall, and the idea of "no more to struggle" gradually broke down in the surrounding villages. The masses in Huanglou shop went to the homes of landlords Sun Daliang and others to dig, and unearthed four canisters of silver coins (a total of one hundred and thirty-six yuan) and a package. The masses excitedly said: "Don't think that the landlords are finished. We will be fooled if we only look at what is in front of our eyes." Cao Baoxiang said, "I only saw that we have been liberated, that there is grain in the granary, that we can eat white flour with wheat, and that the landlords are eating black cornbread. Who knew that what they have hidden away is worth several of our good days?" Landlords in Chen District concealed their land by falsely selling entrusted estates to poor relatives. During this review of the distribution of fruits and class division in Weizhuang sub-district, many entrusted estates were discovered. After research by the sub-district review committee, it was decided that those entrusted estates belonging to middle and poor peasants would be given a certificate to take away, in order to avoid being burdened; those belonging to landlords who had been struggled against would be confiscated. According to investigation, the hidden entrusted estates of one landlord in Zhangzhuang alone amounted to ninety-two mu. Other villages are vigorously investigating.

    查出大批“地下宝”没收地主“寄庄地”
    【本报冀南十一日电】莘县七区识破地主装穷阴谋，追出“地下宝”，克服“没斗头”思想，发现地主很多“寄庄地”，当即没收。该区麦收前后对地主进行追歼后，从形式上看地主的土地斗出了，他们的生活也坏了，中心阁地主张成信在今年过麦时吃的还是黑窝窝（高粮面），表现困苦窘状，受骗的人说：“没有斗头了。”日前忽然从黄庄楼店被斗地主家地下刨出麦子四百五十斤，大缸一口，银子一罐子。干部与群众经过研究后，决定对张成信再查。当由小区干部带领群众到他家去刨地下宝，从墙基下刨出现洋七百三十元，“没斗头”的思想在周围村庄逐渐打破。黄楼店群众到地主孙大良等四家去刨，刨出洋钱四罐子（共一百三十六元），包袱一个，群众兴奋的说：“可不要认为地主没法了，咱光会看眼皮底下这一点就要上当”。曹保祥说：“我光看咱翻了身啦，囤里有了粮食啦，麦里咱能吃白面，地主吃的黑窝窝，谁知人家看不见的东西就顶咱好几个日子呢”？陈区地主为隐藏土地将寄庄地假卖给穷亲戚。魏庄小区在这次复查分果实划分阶层时，发现很多寄庄地，经过小区复查委员研究，决定中贫农的寄庄地写证明信拨走，以免躲避负担；被斗地主的予以没收。据调查仅张庄一户被斗地主隐藏的寄庄地即有九十二亩，其他村正大力清查中。
