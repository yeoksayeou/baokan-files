　　[Reported by this newspaper from Jilu豫 on the 26th] After Fucheng County implemented armed land distribution, the entire area within a hundred li radius universally launched an armed struggle to protect the land and homes. For several months, many villages have been carrying out land reform during the day and armed guard duty at night, simultaneously holding meetings and repelling the enemy. In nearly seven months, the third and fourth districts alone fought more than eighty battles. In June, county-wide joint defense was universally established. Villages requested weapons one after another. Those without guns took up indigenous cannons, bricks and tiles as weapons. The masses are no longer afraid of attacks by the enemy, die-hards, and other forces, and bravely resist enemy harassment and the plundering of livestock and property. The puppet town leader An Kenan led a dozen men to attack Xiaowang Village. The masses only had one gun, which even jammed, but they still repelled the enemy with bricks. In the fourth district, the enemy came over fourteen or fifteen times to loot property, but each time they were repelled by the joint defense team. The tenth district was originally the famous South Fifth Township, known for its self-defense and home protection, and it still stands firm as the border wall of southeastern Cao. On the night of June 18, forty enemies came to Miao Didi Garden to rob grain. The village had no guns, so men and women, young and old, all went up on the roofs. Women carried bricks and tiles, and men threw and attacked, repelling the enemy in one go. Children in each village stood guard, patrolled and checked pedestrians. The masses in the border areas have automatically established a strong blockade line. Currently, tunnels have been universally dug in the county. In the construction of tunnels in the X district, bunkers and shooting holes were created, enabling the tunnels to play a greater role in guerrilla warfare.

　　复程方圆百里武装保田保家
    【本报冀鲁豫二十六日电】复程县实行武装分田后，全境方圆百里普遍展开保田保家武装斗争。数月来不少村都是白天进行土地改革，黑夜武装看家，一面开会一面阻击敌人。在近七个月中，三、四两个区共作战八十次以上。六月份，全县普遍成立了联防，各村纷纷要求枪支，没枪的就拿起了土炮砖瓦作武器，群众已不怕敌、顽、杂的袭击，英勇的抵御了敌人的骚扰与牵牛架户。伪镇长安克南带着十几个人打小王庄，群众只有一条枪，还卡了壳，结果用砖头打退了敌人。四区过来敌人十四、五次出来架户，每次都被联防队击退。十区原是有名的自卫保家的南五乡，现仍屹立作为曹东南的边墙。六月十八日夜，敌人四十名到苗堤园抢粮，该村没有枪，结果男女老少一起上房，女人搬砖瓦，男人投打，一气打退了敌人。各村儿童站岗放哨，盘查行人。边沿区群众已自动建立了一道坚强的封锁线。现该县地道普遍挖完，×区在地道建设中创造了地堡及射击眼使地道在游击战争中更高度发挥其作用。
