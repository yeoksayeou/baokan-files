　　From Fear to Love:
　　A Confession of a Captured KMT Soldier
　　Liu Baolong
　　When I was forced to lay down my weapon, I felt nothing. The whole world was about to be destroyed, and I would be destroyed along with it. I sat silently with my eyes closed in the prisoner group. The fierce gunfire in the front line several miles away was sometimes audible, and our prisoner group was expanding rapidly. After a while, a soldier of the Eighth Route Army came to us, distributed some cigarettes, and said a few words briefly, probably telling us not to be afraid and that the Eighth Route Army treats prisoners leniently. Heavens! How could I believe that at that time? While listening, I tried to widen my blurry eyes, but the annoying night prevented me from seeing the facial expressions of the speaker. I felt this was probably the prelude to the death sentence! My heart and body trembled! I began to regret my identity. But I could comfort myself that I had changed into a soldier's uniform before being captured. I buried all my documents, rings, watches, and other things in the place where I was sitting and came up with a fabricated name: I am Xu Desheng, the squad leader of the sixth company.

　　When I became a little more sober, four soldiers of the Eighth Route Army escorted me and several other officers, heading in an unknown direction. How could I know the direction? Only death occupied everything in me; I couldn't distinguish east, west, north, or south. At this time, it was already dawn. I didn't feel hungry, but I wanted to swallow everything. When I noticed a peculiar astringent spiciness in my mouth, what I spat out turned out to be not food, but the cigarette that had been given to me when I was sitting in the prisoner group!

　　I knew what was happening. Armed soldiers were escorting several captured officers towards a remote mountain gully. Apart from death, could there be a good outcome? I thought several times about jumping off the cliff to end my pitiful life. I thought that dying quickly and decisively would be much better than the impending fate—being buried alive, or being sliced into ten thousand pieces. I had heard a lot about such things in the ruling area, saying that this was called preferential treatment. I knew that such "preferential treatment" would fall on my head today! I repeatedly asked the soldiers to shoot us right in front of them, why bother making us suffer such torture before death? But they comforted me with gentle words. No! It was simply a constant stimulation for me, because I really didn't know whether he was comforting or stimulating me. Or maybe it was to make me die obediently and silently. However, I never committed suicide; I didn't have enough courage. I hoped for a lucky illusion. Before my impending death, I was extremely reluctant to leave life!

　　We were taken to Dongyao, and then from Dongyao to Yuankang. On every leg of the journey, I suspected that the front was the slaughterhouse. I walked towards the tomb with infinite fear. The Eighth Route Army soldiers in charge of managing us were all smiling. Yes, who doesn't love to see smiling faces? But at this time, I was very disgusted with this smiling face. Smiling was more uncomfortable than any stimulation applied to me! I knew the meaning of their smiles: victory; pride. Of course, they should be proud. But behind the smile was a steel knife! I was like a little chicken tied up waiting to be slaughtered, with the possibility of a knife on my neck at any time and any place. I hated everything, resented everything, but also cherished everything!

　　Six or seven days passed, and the Eighth Route Army didn't kill me. This made me start to doubt. --Although the person in charge explained in many ways that the Communist Party was lenient, I couldn't believe it! --I hoped that this unknown fate would come quickly, but it was always slow to come. Many questions were swirling in my mind. I guessed and judged, but couldn't find the reason. I thought to myself: How mysterious! The Chinese Communist Party!

　　After extreme fear, came serious illness: running a high fever, and the next day I couldn't get out of bed. Under terror, doubt, and serious illness, I began to feel sad: Not being killed on the battlefield could be called the greatest luck in "misfortune", but today I would die of illness in this remote north. When I bid farewell to the world forever, who could send a letter to my mother and wife far away in Jiangnan? How painful would they be when they learned of my death? Who caused me to be separated from my family, Jiangnan and Hebei, vast and boundless, leaving my soul in a foreign land? …

　　The afterglow of the setting sun flashed into the window, gently stroking my sick body. I leaned against the wall, gazing at the blue sky outside the window, yearning for the beautiful spring scenery of my hometown and my beloved mother and wife. This was the seventh day of my illness. The high fever had subsided. I didn't know how long I had been sick? Nor did I understand how I had gotten through it? I only found several empty needle bottles and a lot of food beside my pillow; my soldier's uniform was gone; I was wearing a coarse cloth military uniform, I didn't know what was going on? I wanted to ask, but the room was quiet and there was no one there. Could it be the Yama's palace? No, there were also many scattered bedding and singing voices coming from afar.

　　People came back happily. When they saw that I had regained consciousness, they all shouted: "Good heavens! You're awake. You've been sick for six or seven days, but the medical officer and the captain were so busy. They came to see you many times every day and gave you injections. If it weren't for the careful care, you would have entered the gate of hell long ago!" At this time, I understood everything, but who changed my clothes? I was about to speak when a familiar and excited shout suddenly came from the courtyard: "Xu Desheng is awake?!" Now I felt very uncomfortable in my heart listening to this name. Xu Desheng, maybe he could survive, and he would survive better and more valuable. I was about to answer when the communications soldier flashed in through the doorway. As soon as he entered the door, he said, "The captain asked me to invite the doctor for you. The doctor said he would come at one o'clock, but it's one thirty now and he hasn't come yet. I was about to leave when I heard that you were awake, so I came to see you first..." Before he could finish speaking, Old Zhang, who came with me, interrupted: "That clothes is the captain's. After you got sick, the lice crawled outside. The captain asked him (Old Zhang pointed to the communications soldier) to send the clothes you are wearing now, and he personally ran over to watch them being changed." At this time, I looked silently and ashamed at the grass-green military uniform on my body and couldn't say a word.

　　Li Changting, a major adjutant in his fifties, sighed and said to himself: "A mother couldn't treat her own son any better!" Yes, what else could a mother do for her son? I carefully chewed on this topic.

　　The captain came, and everyone in the room looked at him with kind eyes. But I pulled the quilt over my head. I didn't know why, but it wasn't fear anymore. I knew the captain didn't like to talk much, but as soon as he entered the door, I heard him calmly question the communications soldier: "I told you to invite the doctor, why are you still here?"

　　The communications soldier seemed bored and said something, then skipped and ran out.

　　The captain sat beside me, reached out and uncovered my quilt, pressed my head, and slowly opened his mouth and said: "I heard that your fever has gone down, so I came to see you. These few days, because of the constant increase in people, I've been too busy to come often. The doctor is also very busy..." Old Zhang interjected again: "What else do we want? What qualifications do we have to receive such treatment?" The captain smiled and said: "Yes, strictly speaking, that's indeed the case. But the people are lenient to you, that is to save you. Because you have committed crimes against the people in the past. If you are hell-bent on being a running dog for the reactionaries, the people will not be lenient to him." I watched everyone in the room lower their heads ashamed. The captain smiled and said again: "Okay! He's just getting better, everyone take care of him more, I have something to do." The captain got up to leave. At this time, I only felt my eyes were moist and my eyes were blurred, so I stopped the captain who had walked to the door. My call surprised everyone, probably because my throat was a little choked! I tightly grasped the captain's hand and said in a trembling voice: "Captain, I am sorry to the Communist Party and the people, I am sorry to you. I now want to sincerely confess my inner thoughts to you and I am willing to be severely punished!"

　　"Is it about your class position and historical issues?"

　　I didn't understand how he guessed what I was going to say. I immediately replied: "Yes!" I felt my voice was very low, but the captain said: "You've just recovered from your illness, rest first, we'll talk slowly later. But I know your general situation, but because you were afraid and also sick, we didn't talk about it. I know you're not called Xu Desheng, your real name is Xie Dasheng, your childhood name is Agou. You used to be a lieutenant colonel deputy regimental commander, and you were demoted to company commander when you were captured. You graduated from a higher elementary school. Because your family was poor and you suffered from famine, you even begged for food before joining the army. Last year, the troops were reorganized and you were laid off. In the officers' team, you and a few others robbed a restaurant; Sheng Shicai's four cars of gold and silver treasures were robbed by the officers' team, and you were one of them, ...hehe, right?" He smiled. But everyone present seemed stunned. I felt even more that my whole body was boiling. The captain said again: "In fact, we understand everyone's situation. We can't blame you for not confessing before. This is the influence of the old society and Chiang Kai-shek. I hope you will study hard in the future and understand some principles. Okay, I'm leaving. Wait for the doctor to come and see you later, and quickly get your body better."

　　I stared blankly at the captain's back, my mind was very messy. I wondered how he knew so clearly? And since he knew my identity, why did he still take care of me like this? I didn't believe this was a realistic thing in history. Could there be such a thing in the world? Who is this for? Great Chinese Communist Party! I will always follow you forward, as long as you don't abandon me. …

　　从恐惧到热爱：
    一个被俘蒋军的自述
    刘宝龙
    当我被迫放下武器的时候，我没有任何的感觉，整个世界都快要毁灭了，我也将随之而毁灭。我闭着眼默坐在俘虏群里，数里外前线激烈的枪炮声时隐时现，我们这俘虏群也随着迅速地扩大起来。一会，一位八路军来到我们跟前，给我们散发了一些纸烟，简短地说了几句话，大概是叫我们不要骇怕，八路军优待俘虏等。天哪！我那时怎么能够置信呢？在听讲的时候，我用力瞪大了模糊的双眼，然而讨厌的夜使我不能看清讲话者的面部表情。我觉得这大概就是宣布死刑的前奏吧！我的心身颤抖了！我开始悔恨我的身份。但是尚可聊以自慰的是我在被俘前已经换了士兵服装，我把身上所有的证件、戒指、手表等物埋藏在我坐的地方，并给自己想好了捏造的名姓：我叫许得生，是六连的下士副班长。
    当我稍稍清醒过来的时候，四个八路战士押解了我还有其它几个军官，向着不可知的方向走去。我何尚不知方向呢？只是死占据了我的一切，我不分东西南北了。此时天已大亮。我也不觉得肚饿，但我却想把一切都吞了下去。当我觉察到嘴里一种特异的涩辣时，吐出来的东西原来不是食品，而是在俘虏群里坐着的时候发给我的香烟！
    我知道这是怎么回事了。武装士兵押送几个俘虏军官向着僻静的山沟走，除死之外，还会有好的结果吗？我几次想跳下山岩，算是结束了我这可怜的一生。我认为痛快干脆的死去，会比即将到来的命运——活埋、万刀剐、——好的多。这样的事在统治区我曾听说的不少，说这就叫作优待。我知道这样的“优待”今天要轮到我的头上了！我几次要求战士就在眼前把我们枪毙了吧，何必叫在死之前受这样的折磨呢？可是他们却温存地用好言安慰我。不！简直说是不断地刺激我吧，因为我真的不知道他是安慰还是刺激。或者就是要我顺从地无声无息地死去。然而我终未自杀，我的勇气还不够。我希望着一个侥幸的幻影，在将死之前，我对生是万分的留恋啊！
    我们被解到东窑，再由东窑解到元康。在每一段路程里我都怀疑前面就是屠场。我带着无限恐怖的心情走向坟墓。负责管理我们的八路军都是笑容可掬的。是的，谁不爱看笑脸呢？但我此时却对这个笑脸十分的厌恶。笑，比加于我的任何刺激还要难受！我知道他们笑的意义是胜利；骄傲。当然，应该骄傲。但在笑的背后是钢刀！目前的我正犹如一只被缚待宰的小鸡，随时随地有刀锋加颈的可能。我厌恶一切，愤恨一切，但同时也留恋一切！
    六七天的时间过去了，八路军没有杀我。这使我开始怀疑了。——虽有负责人多方的解释说共产党是宽大的，但我不能相信呵！——我希望这不可知的命运赶快到来，但总是迟迟不决。许多问题在我脑子里打着问号，我猜测判断，但找不出所以然来。我心里想：多神秘呀！中国共产党！
    极端恐惧之后，跟来的是重病：发着高热，第二天便不能起床。恐怖、怀疑、重病之下，我开始伤感起来：在战场上没有打死可谓“不幸”中之大幸，然而今天我将因病而死在这遥远的北方。当我与世永别之时，谁又能给我远在江南的母亲及妻子捎一封信呢？她们知道了我的死耗又该是如何的痛苦呢？这是谁使我骨肉离散，江南河北，苍苍茫茫、遗魂异乡？……
    夕阳的余波闪进窗里来，轻轻地抚摸着我的病体。我依墙而卧，斜望着那窗外蓝蓝的天空，憧憬着我那故乡美丽的春光和我所怀念的母亲和妻子。这是我发病的第七天了。高热已退。我不知道过了多长时间的病生活了？也不明白是怎样过来的？我只发觉在我的枕旁有数支打过的空针瓶和许多食品；我的士兵服不见了；身上穿的是粗布军衣，我不知道这是怎么回事？我想询问一下，屋子里又是静悄悄的没有一个人，难道是阎王殿吗？不会，一旁还有许多散乱的被褥和远处传来的歌唱声。
    人们都喜盈盈地回来了。他们看到我已恢复知觉，便都喊了起来：“老天哪！你醒来了，你病了六七天，可是把医官，队长忙坏了，每天不知来看你多少次，给你打针。要不是照顾的周到，你早就进了鬼门关了！”这时我一切都明白了，但衣服又是谁给我换上的呢？我正想说话，院里突然传来一声熟悉而又兴奋的叫喊：“许得生醒过来了？！”我现在听着这个名字心里非常难受。许得生，也许能得到生存，并且将会生存得更好，更有价值。我刚要回答，闪进门槛来的是通讯员，他一进门就说：“队长叫我给你去请医生，医生说下一点钟来，现在一点半了还没来，我正要走，听说你醒过来了，我就先来看看……。”没等他说完，站在一旁和我一块来的老张插上嘴说：“你那衣服还是队长的。你病了以后，虱子都爬到外面来了，队长就让他（老张指着通讯员）把你现在穿着的这件衣服送来，并亲自跑来看着换上的。”这时我惭愧地默默地望着身上草绿色的军衣说不出一句话来。
    五十余岁的少校副官李长亭在一边叹了一口气，自言自语地说：“母亲对亲儿也不过如此吧！”是的，母亲对儿子又能怎样呢？我细细地咀嚼着这个题目。
    队长来了，全屋内的人都用一种亲切的目光望着他。但是我却把被子一拉盖住头，我不知道这是为了什么，但再也不是害怕。我知道队长不爱多说话，但一进门我就听见他很镇定地质问通讯员：“叫你去请医生，怎么还在这个地方？”
    通讯员似乎没趣的说了声什么，便蹦跳着跑出去了。
    队长坐在我的身旁伸手揭开了我的被子按着头，慢慢地开口道：“我听说你已经退了热，便来看看你。这几天因为不断地增加人，忙的也顾不上多来，医生也同样忙的很……”又是老张插嘴道：“还要怎样哩？我们这些人有啥资格受这样的待遇？”队长笑了笑说：“是的，严格讲起来那的确是这样。不过人民对你们宽大，就是要挽救你们。因为你们过去对人民是有罪的。如果死心蹋地替反动派当走狗，人民对他也就不会宽大了。”我望着屋里的人都惭愧的低下了头。队长笑了笑又说：“好吧！他才好了，你们大家多招呼招呼他，我还有点事。”队长起来要走。这时我只觉得眼睛湿润，眼前模糊一片，于是我把走到房门口的队长叫住。我这一叫，人们都惊讶地望着我，大概是我的喉咙里有些哽咽吧！我紧紧地握住了队长的手，声音颤抖地说：“队长，我对不起共产党和人民，对不起你，我现在要向你诚恳坦白地说出我的内心话，并甘愿受到严厉的处分！”
    “是不是关于你的阶级职务和历史问题？”
    我不明白他怎么就猜透了我要说的话。我随即回答：“是的！”我觉得我的声音很低，但队长却说了：“病刚好，先休养休养，以后慢慢再谈。不过我知道你的大概情形，只是因你害怕，并且又在病中，所以没有谈。我知道你不叫许得生，你的真名姓是谢大胜，乳名叫阿狗，从前当过中校副团长，到被俘时你被降成了连长。住高小出来因为家贫又遭荒年你还讨过饭，后来才当兵。去年部队整编，你被编余，在军官队里和别的几个人抢过一家饭店；盛世才四汽车金银财宝被军官队抢光了，你也是其中之一，……嘿嘿，是不是？”他笑了。但所有在场的人都似乎呆了。我更觉得全身都沸腾起来。队长又说：“其实每个人的情形我们都是了解的。你以前不坦白，也不能怪你，这是旧社会、蒋介石给你的影响，希望你们以后努力学习，明白一些道理。好，我就走了，等会医生来了再给你看一下，赶快把身体弄好。”
    我呆呆地望着队长的背影，脑子里乱的很。我怀疑他怎么知道的如此清楚？而且既然知道我的身份，为什么仍这样地关照我，我不相信这是历史上的现实事情，世界上会有这样的事吗？这是为了谁？伟大的中国共产党！我将永远跟着你前进，只要你不摈弃我。……
