　　Black Dan's Parents are Back
　　Zhiming
　　By the time we arrived at the campsite, the roosters were already crowing. The administrator assigned us to stay in the house with an old locust tree in front of the door. I knocked on the door for a long time, but no one answered. Growing anxious, I climbed over the low wall, jumped into the courtyard, and opened the gate.

　　My commander and I walked into the courtyard, then through the passageway into the backyard, but still didn't see anyone. I was heading towards the north room when I suddenly saw something white and shiny on the stone steps. It didn't look like a cat, nor did it look like a stone. I took a closer look and was shocked to find it was a child, lying there naked.

　　It was already past midnight, and the wind was howling through the tree branches. The commander quickly picked up the child and wrapped him in his overcoat. While tidying up the house, I thought to myself, "Where did these villagers go? Abandoning their own child, it's really strange. The Eighth Route Army doesn't eat people!"

　　I found a pair of tattered cotton pants under the bed and put the little fellow in them. I gently patted him a few times and then ran out to find the villagers.

　　The troops had all settled down to rest. I walked back and forth but didn't encounter anyone. Feeling discouraged, I ran back and discovered that the back door was open. I thought, "The villagers must have slipped out through the back door when they heard us knocking."

　　Looking out from the back door, it was a dark void. A gust of north wind made me shiver. To the west, the sound of machine guns and cannons was incessant. I had just heard the commander say that tonight our troops were attacking the four gates of Tangyin city, and this place was at most seventeen or eighteen *li* away from the city.

　　I went back into the room, and the little fellow woke up, wailing loudly. I took him out of the tattered cotton pants and put him in my quilt, gently patting him a few times. But he kept crying, and the more he cried, the more heartbroken he became. Tears and saliva streamed down my neck, and his little feet seemed to be doing morning exercises on my stomach. It was really driving me crazy.

　　He must be hungry. What could I give him to eat? Milk? Of course, I didn't have any. I got up and poured a handful of biscuits from my ration bag. I broke off a piece and stuffed it into the little fellow's mouth. He stopped crying, and I was very happy. I held his waist with both hands and felt his back. It was all bones, definitely a poor kid.

　　After a while, the little fellow spat out the biscuit, which dripped wetly onto my chest. He started crying again, uncontrollably. At that moment, I suddenly remembered how my mother fed my little brother. She always chewed the food first and then fed it to him. I followed suit, biting off a piece of biscuit, chewing it, and stuffing it into the little fellow's mouth.

　　It was really becoming a problem. The little fellow, after eating my chewed biscuit, started sucking on my tongue desperately. It tickled so much that my heart went numb. Of course, no milk came out of my tongue. He became impatient, bumped his head against my face a few times, and then started crying loudly again.

　　The commander seemed to be awake and coughed. He had been busy at the front lines for a whole day and night the day before, and tonight he had walked sixty or seventy *li*. Running into this little fellow was simply...

　　"Guard!" the commander called out, "Go and find his family quickly! He's disturbing people!"

　　Where could I go to find them? I had just run around aimlessly, unable to find a soul. I put on my clothes again and ran out, searching from the east end to the west end, all the way to the ditch outside the village, but still couldn't find them.

　　Walking into the courtyard, I could hear the little fellow crying. I stood in the courtyard for a while, feeling worried. I saw that the east room was a kitchen. I ran in anxiously and recklessly, found a small pot, and boiled some water.

　　I soaked the biscuits in the hot water, stirred them with chopsticks, and then fed the little fellow, mouthful by mouthful. He ate like someone released from prison. He kept eating as I kept feeding him. He finished a full bowl of swollen, soaked biscuits.

　　While sleeping drowsily, I suddenly felt a burst of heat on my stomach. I thought I was dreaming. I reached out and touched it. Oh no, it was sticky and gooey, and a stench went straight up my nostrils.

　　It really infuriated me. I really wanted to give him a good spanking, but when I reached out and felt his skinny body, I couldn't bring myself to do it.

　　I got up, lit the lamp, and put the little fellow back into the tattered cotton pants. My pants, my sheet, even my underpants—I won't go into detail, it was simply a mess.

　　"Guard!" the commander called out again, "What are you getting up to again?"

　　"What am I getting up to?" I didn't answer, thinking, "This is a serious problem!"

　　The little fellow's eyes were wide open, and he wasn't crying. I was really sleepy. I carelessly wiped the quilt a bit and then fell soundly asleep.

　　I forgot what kind of dream I had. I don't know what happened, but suddenly, I was startled awake. I opened my eyes and saw that the room was brightly lit. I threw on my clothes and saw someone standing in front of the door through the crack. I opened the door and saw an old woman, sixty or seventy years old, looking both pitiful and frightened. She suddenly knelt down to me, which startled me, and I quickly helped her up.

　　"Old woman, are you the landlord of this house?" I ran to the bed, pulled back the quilt, and said to her, "This is your child, quickly take him away!"

　　The old woman's hair was completely white, and she was wearing tattered cotton clothes. She held the child in her arms and kissed him desperately, sobbing uncontrollably.

　　At this time, the commander also got up. He was talking to the old woman about this and that, and I went to the kitchen to fetch water for washing.

　　When I came back with the basin of water, I saw another woman in the room, in her thirties, very thin, with hair covering her face. She was sitting and feeding the little fellow milk.

　　"Old woman! Why did you run away last night? We looked everywhere, but couldn't find you."

　　"I didn't know it was you, the Eighth Route Army, who had come!..." The old woman seemed to have seen a relative, unable to speak from grief. She wiped away her tears and said, "How could I not be afraid? Heavens, the Central Army came to the city the day before yesterday and arrested Black Dan's father. It's been three days now, and he hasn't returned. The family's grain is also... his wife is also..."

　　As she spoke, both the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law began to sob. The commander persuaded them for a long time, telling them that when the Eighth Route Army opened Tangyin city, Black Dan's father could return.

　　"Look! This Black Dan...," The old woman suddenly saw that my bed sheet was soiled. She rushed to take it to wash, and I struggled with her, and my face turned red.

　　Seven or eight days later, the troops were marching through a village at night. I saw a ditch and remembered that this was the village where Black Dan's family lived. Entering the street, I saw two people standing under the old locust tree. I recognized the old woman and called out to her.

　　"Old woman, why aren't you asleep so late?"

　　"Oh! You've come!" She pointed to the person standing in front of her and said, "This is Black Dan's father. The Eighth Route Army opened Tangyin city the day before yesterday and released him."

　　Black Dan's father was also very friendly to me. He grabbed my hand and asked me to come in and sit. I told him that I had to catch up with the troops. The old woman hurriedly ran inside to call out Black Dan's mother and son. The little fellow was still as silly as ever. I pinched his face, feeling an indescribable emotion. After standing for a while, I turned around to catch up with the troops. Black Dan's father wanted to see me off, running behind me and shouting!

　　"Comrade! Come again in the future! This is Fudao Town, my name is Tian Mingde, come again!..."

　　I turned back and shook his hand, and told him my name was Zhang Xingcai, and that I would visit him again when the troops were nearby. I ran another half *li* before catching up with the troops.

　　黑旦的爹娘都回来了
    志明
    到宿营地，鸡已经在叫了。管理员指定我们住在门口有颗老槐树的家里。我敲门敲了老半天，里面没有人吭气，我发急了，就顺着矮墙，爬上了屋顶，跳进院子把大门打开。
    我同首长走进院子，又从过道走进后院，都不见一个人影。我正向北屋走，忽然看见石阶上有个啥东西，白闪闪的，说猫不象猫，说石头不象石头，拢去一看，把我骇了一跳，原来是一个小孩，光着屁股躺在那里。
    天已到下半夜了，风吹的树枝在呼呼地响，首长急忙把小孩抱起来，用他的大衣裹住。我边收拾房子心里边想：“这家老乡跑到那里去了？连自己的孩子也不要，真日怪，八路军也不会吃人！”
    在床底下找到了一条破棉裤，把那小家伙装在里面，我轻轻地拍了他几下，就跑出去找那家老乡。
    队伍都住下休息了。我来回走了一趟，没有碰上一个人，很泄气地跑了回来，发现后院的门是开的，我想：“这家老乡一定是听见我们拍门时从后门溜了的。”
    从后门望出去，黑洞洞的一片，一阵阵北风吹得我打了个寒噤。靠西边，机枪声、炮声不停的在响，刚才听首长说，今晚我们有部队攻汤阴城的四关，这儿离城顶多不过十七八里地。
    我进房里，小家伙醒了，哇哇的在哭。我把他从破棉裤里抱出来，放进我被子里，轻轻拍了几下，他还是哭，而且越哭越伤心，眼泪口水统统流在我脖子上，两只小脚好象在我肚子上下早操，真把我急的没法。
    他准是想吃东西，有啥给他吃呢？奶，我当然是没有的。我爬起来从干粮袋里倒出一把饼干，撇了一块塞在小家伙嘴里，他不哭了，我很高兴，两只手抱住他的腰，又摸摸他的脊背，光骨头，一定是个穷小子。
    不一会，小家伙把饼干吐了出来，水滴滴地滑到我胸口上，他又哭的不得开交，那时，我突然想起俺娘喂俺小弟弟的饭，总是自己先嚼一下，再喂给小弟弟吃。我也照样子咬了块饼干嚼了一下，塞在小家伙嘴里。
    真成问题，小家伙吃了我嚼碎的饼干还死命地吸起我的舌头来了，怪痒痒的，我心都发麻了。舌头当然吸不出奶来，他不耐烦了，把脑袋在我脸上撞了几下，又大哭特哭起来。
    首长好象是醒了，咳嗽了一声，前天打仗他到前面去忙了一天一夜，今天晚上又走了六七十里，碰上这小家伙简直是……。
    “警卫员！”首长喊：“你快去把他家里人找回来吧！吵坏了人！”
    上哪儿去找呢？刚才空跑了一趟，鬼也找不着，我又穿上衣服跑出去，从东头找到西头，一直找到村外的水沟边，还是找不着。
    走进院子就听到小家伙的哭声，我在院子里站了一会，正在发愁，看见东屋是个厨房，我心焦八乱地跑进去，找个小锅烧了点开水。
    我把饼干泡进开水里，用筷子搅了一下，然后一口口地喂给小家伙吃。他象饿牢里放出来的，我一直喂他一直吃，满满的一碗泡涨了的饼干，都吃得净光。
    睡得迷迷糊糊的，忽然觉得肚皮上热了一阵，我以为是在作梦，伸手一摸，糟糕，粘糊糊的，一股臭气直往我鼻孔里钻。
    真把我气死了，真想狠狠地打他一顿，但伸手摸摸他那浑身光骨头，还是打不下手。
    我爬起来点着灯，又把那小家伙装进破棉裤里。我的裤子上，单子上，连我的裤叉上，不说了，简直是一踏糊涂。
    “警卫员！”首长又在叫：“你又爬起来干啥？”
    “干啥？”我没有答应，心想：“问题严重哩！”
    小家伙两只眼睛睁得多大，也不哭。我实在困得要命，马马虎虎把被子擦了一下，就呼呼地睡了。
    我忘记了是做个啥梦，不知怎么回事，突然，把我惊醒了，睁眼一看，屋子里照得亮通通的。我披上衣服，在门缝里仿佛看见有一个人站在房门口。我把门打开一看，一个六七十岁的老太太，现出又可怜又害怕的样子，猛的向我跪下，这可把我搞慌了，赶快把他扶了起来。
    “老太太，老人家是这家房东吧！”我跑到床跟前，掀开被子，对她说：“这是你家小孩，快抱去吧！”
    老太太头发全白了，穿了一身破破烂烂的棉衣，她把孩子抱在手里，不要命的亲了一下，一抽一抽地哭起来。
    这时，首长也起床了，他在对老太太讲这讲那，我就到火房打洗脸水去了。
    等我端盆水回来，看见房子里又有一个三十来岁的女人，瘦的很，头发蓬到脸上，她坐着喂小家伙奶。
    “老太太！你们昨天晚上为啥跑了，到处找，找不着。”
    “俺不知道是你们八路军来了！………”老太太好象见了亲人，难受的说不出话来，她擦了擦眼泪，说道：“俺怎么不怕？老天爷，前天城里中央队伍来了，把黑旦他爹抓走了，现在三天了，还没有回来。家里粮食也……他媳妇也……”
    说着婆媳俩人都呜呜咽咽哭出声来了。首长劝说了他老大一会，告他八路军打开汤阴城，黑旦他爹可以回来。
    “你看！这黑旦………，”老太太忽然看见我的被单糊脏了，她抢着要拿去洗，我和她拖来拖去，我的脸都红了。
    过了七八天，队伍晚上行军路过一个村子，看见一条水沟，我就想起这是黑旦他家那个村。进了街，我看见那棵老槐树下站着两个人。那个老太太我是认识的，我拢去喊了她一声！
    “老太太，这样晚，你们还没有睡觉？”
    “唉呀！你来了！”她指着站在她跟前的那个人，说道：“这就是黑旦他爹，大前天八路军打开汤阴城，把他放回来了。”
    黑旦他爹对我也很亲热，一把抓住我的手，要我进家坐。我告他要赶队伍，老太太就急忙跑进去把黑旦娘儿俩叫出来。那小家伙还是那样傻头傻脑，我把他的脸拧了一下，心里说不出一种味道。站了一会，我就转过去赶队伍了，黑旦他爹要送我，跟在我后面边跑边喊！
    “同志！你以后再来吧！这是伏道镇，俺叫田明德，再来吧！………”
    我回头把他的手拉了一下，并告他我叫张星材，队伍隔得近再来看他，我又跑了半里来地，才赶上队伍。
