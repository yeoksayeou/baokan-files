Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 29th: According to an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 27th, the black market price of US dollars has soared, and in reality, it is impossible to buy US dollars on the black market. On the 26th, the highest price for one US dollar was 55,000 Chiang Kai-shek yuan; on the 27th, the market opened at 48,000, rising to 52,000 yuan. Financial circles describe this slight dip as a temporary respite. At the same time, the Chiang Kai-shek government, attempting to suppress the plummeting currency value, is encountering an even worse problem—a sky-high rise in prices. Because US dollars are unavailable, those who originally purchased US dollars have turned to buying other goods, causing prices to double in a week. According to a United Press report, the black market price of gold in Shanghai reached 2.8 million yuan per tael on the 27th, a 100% increase compared to mid-May. American businessmen predict that even if the United States extends the loan deadline, it will only temporarily stabilize the situation; the daily increase in the issuance of paper money will inevitably cause prices to continue to rise in proportion to the circulation of paper money. The English-language China Press warns that if the current inflation is not stopped, it is difficult to say how the economies of Shanghai or other places will be maintained.

　　上海经济将无法维持
  　物价一周内又涨一倍
    【新华社陕北二十九日电】据美联社二十七日沪讯：由于美钞黑市飞涨，实际上在黑市上已买不到美钞。二十六日美钞最高价为蒋币五万五千元，二十七日开盘为四万八，上涨至五万二千元。金融界形容此一稍微回跌为暂时的休憩。与此同时，企图抑压币值狂跌的蒋政府则又遇到甚至是最坏的问题——物价直腾云霄般的上涨。因为买不到美钞，原来购买美钞的人转而购其他货品，已使物价在一周内高涨一倍。另据合众社消息：二十七日上海的金黑市每两已达二百八十万元，较五月中旬涨百分之百。美国商人预料，即令美国延长贷款截止期，亦只能暂时使情况稳定一下；印刷机每日增发纸币，物价必将依纸币流通的比例继续增涨。英文字林西报警告称：目前通货膨胀如不停止，就很难说上海或其他地方的经济将如何维持下去了。
