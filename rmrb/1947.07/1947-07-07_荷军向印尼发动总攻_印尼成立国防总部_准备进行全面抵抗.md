　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: Comprehensive reports indicate that the situation in Indonesia has become increasingly tense recently due to the Netherlands' insistence on its ultimatum and deployment of new military offensives. Dutch Governor-General van Mook presented the Dutch government's ultimatum to the Republic of Indonesia on the 23rd of last month, insisting that Indonesia accept the demands included in the Dutch note of May 27, namely the establishment of an "Indonesian Federal Government" (note: the Indonesian Federation includes several entities, with the Republic of Indonesia being only one of them, and the East Indonesian Republic, planned and established by the Dutch, also being a member. The Dutch demand the establishment of this alliance government to use its vassals to interfere in the internal affairs and diplomacy of the Republic of Indonesia) and "Dutch-Indonesian Joint Security Forces." According to reports, Indonesian President Sukarno issued a formal reply on the 28th, rejecting the Dutch proposal to establish joint security forces. Prior to this, Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir had advocated for concessions to the Netherlands, but left-wing groups such as the Indonesian Communist Party, Socialist Party, Socialist Youth League, and Labor Party all expressed firm opposition on the 26th. Sukarno's Nationalist Party also disagreed, and Sjahrir resigned on the 28th, with the position of Prime Minister transferred to President Sukarno. According to official reports from the headquarters of the Indonesian Republican Army, the Netherlands is scheduled to launch a general offensive against Indonesia at 6:00 AM on the 30th. To cope with this event, the headquarters of the Indonesian Republican Army issued an order on the 29th, requiring all combat troops to prepare for full-scale combat. The Republic of Indonesia also passed a resolution on the 20th to establish a People's National Defense Headquarters in preparation for all-out resistance. Dutch democrats have opposed the current authorities' aggressive actions. The head of the Amsterdam Central Trade Union recently announced a resolution declaring a general strike to protest the concentration of Dutch tank forces near Amsterdam in preparation for transporting them to Indonesia to massacre the Indonesian people.

　　荷军向印尼发动总攻
  　印尼成立国防总部
  　准备进行全面抵抗
    【新华社陕北一日电】综合报导：最近印尼形势因荷兰坚持其最后通牒和布置新的军事攻势而益趋紧张。荷兰总督樊穆克曾于上月二十三日将荷兰政府之最后通牒递交印尼共和国，坚持印尼须接受荷方五月二十七日照会中所包括的要求，即成立“印尼联邦政府”（按印尼联邦包括几个单位，印尼共和国仅是其中之一，而由荷方策划成立之东印度共和国亦为其成员之一，荷方要求成立此联盟政府，目的在于利用其附庸干涉印尼共和国内政外交。）及“荷印联合治安部队”。据息，印尼总统苏加诺已于二十八日发表正式答复拒绝荷方所提建立联合治安部队。在此之前，印尼总理沙和尔曾主张对荷兰采取让步，但印尼共产党、社会党、社会主义青年党及劳工党等左翼集团均于二十六日表示坚决反对，苏加诺之国民党亦不赞同，沙氏乃于二十八日宣告辞职，总理职务已移交总统苏加诺。据印尼共和军总部所获正式报告，荷兰定于三十日上午六时向印尼发动总攻。为应付此一事变，印尼共和军总部已于二十九日发布命令，要一切战斗部队准备进行全力战斗。印尼共和国并于二十日通过成立人民国防总部，以备进行全面抵抗。荷兰民主人士纷纷反对党局此种侵略行动，阿姆斯特丹中央职工会负责人顷公布决议，宣布总罢工，抗议荷兰坦克部队在阿姆斯特丹附近集中，准备运往印尼屠杀印尼人民。
