Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd. Ta Kung Pao of Tianjin published an editorial on the 11th of last month entitled "On the Arrest of Journalists," protesting the arrest of its reporter, Zeng Minzhi, and others. Since May, the Chiang government has not only been frantically arresting students and other democrats who oppose the civil war and oppose hunger in major cities in the Chiang-controlled areas, but also arresting large numbers of journalists. Even the most moderate Ta Kung Pao's reporters were not spared. The Ta Kung Pao editorial stated: "Since dawn on June 1, this newspaper has successively encountered three misfortunes: (1) Eight people, including Chongqing-based reporter Zeng Minzhi, were arrested; (2) Chen Fan, a special correspondent stationed in Guangzhou, was arrested; (3) Tianjin conducted news censorship from June 1 to June 9, and most of this newspaper's news dispatches and special articles were withheld. This is certainly a misfortune for Ta Kung Pao, but it is even more a misfortune for the 'nation' (note: referring to the Chiang family)." Because this affects the so-called "credibility" of "implementing constitutional government." It continued: "The duty of a journalist is to pursue news... Today, when problems occur in schools across the country, journalists will naturally pay attention to school news. In today's situation, as long as a reporter from an independent newspaper goes to various schools to interview news, there is a possibility of being arrested for being considered to be conspiring to incite student unrest. The eight reporters from this newspaper arrested in Chongqing were mostly field reporters; Chen Fan, a reporter from this newspaper arrested in Guangzhou, was arrested in his sleep by 'household registration inspectors' because he followed the student ranks and interviewed news during the student strike parade at Zhongshan University on May 31, witnessed a bloody incident along the way, and drafted a telegram when he returned to his residence (this telegram was withheld, and the newspaper has not received it yet)." The newspaper finally demanded the release of the arrested journalists and that the news censorship system not be revived. According to a Central News Agency report, Zeng Minzhi, Fang Meng, and other reporters from Chongqing Ta Kung Pao, as well as a batch of reporters from other newspapers, a total of eighteen people, were successively arrested on the 27th and 29th of last month by Chiang's Chongqing Garrison Headquarters, falsely accused of being "Communist Party spies" who were "plotting riots," and continue to be imprisoned.

　　蒋党大捕新闻记者
  　大公报也提出抗议要求释放
    【新华社陕北二日电】天津大公报于上月十一日发表社评“论逮捕记者”，抗议该报记者曾敏之等之被捕。按自五月以来，蒋政府在蒋区各大城市不仅疯狂逮捕反内战反饥饿的学生及其他民主人士，而且大捕新闻记者，连最温和的大公报的记者亦不能幸免。大公报社评称：“自六月一日天未亮的时候起，本报连续遭遇了三件不幸：（一）重庆本报记者曾敏之等八人被捕；（二）本报驻广州特派员陈凡被捕；（三）天津自六月一日起至九日止进行新闻检查，本报新闻专电特稿大半被扣。这固然是大公报的不幸，其实更是‘国家’（按：指蒋家）的不幸。”因为这影响到所谓“实施宪政”的“信誉”。继称：“新闻记者之职务在追逐新闻……今天各地学校里发生问题，新闻记者自然要注意学校新闻。今天情形，只要是独立报纸的记者到各学校采访新闻，就有被认为阴谋鼓动学潮而遭逮捕的可能。重庆所捕本报八位记者，大都是外勤记者；广州所捕本报记者陈凡，就因为五月三十一中山大学学生罢课游行时，他步随学生行列，采访新闻，中途目击血案，回寓当撰发电报（此电被扣，报馆迄未收到），当夜睡梦中即被‘检查户口’者逮捕。”该报最后要求释放被捕记者，并再不让新闻检查制复活。按另据中央社息，重庆大公报记者曾敏之、方蒙等及其他报纸记者一批共十八人，相继于上月二十七日及二十九日，被蒋记重庆警备部妄诬为“策动暴动”之“中共特务”而逮捕，继续囚禁中。
