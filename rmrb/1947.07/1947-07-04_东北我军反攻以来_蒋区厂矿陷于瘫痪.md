Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st. According to the Central News Agency and the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao: Since the Democratic Allied Forces launched a powerful counteroffensive, the economic situation in the KMT-occupied areas of Northeast China has deteriorated. As many important resources and mines (such as the Xi'an Coal Mine, etc.) have fallen into the hands of the people in the liberated areas, the factories and mines in the unliberated areas have also been paralyzed. The famous Fushun Coal Mine has ceased production because most of the workers have been forcibly conscripted by the KMT army to build fortifications; Anshan, threatened by the People's Liberation Army, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, a bureaucratic capitalist enterprise, has also virtually ceased operations.

　　东北我军反攻以来
  　蒋区厂矿陷于瘫痪
    【新华社陕北一日电】据中央社及津大公报透露：自民主联军展开强大反攻以来，东北蒋占区经济情况日趋恶化。由于许多重要资源及矿厂（如西安煤矿等）之落入解放区人民手中，尚未解放地区之厂矿亦已陷于瘫痪状态，著名之抚顺煤矿因工人多为蒋军强征构筑防御工事，生产已停顿；鞍山因受人民解放军威胁，官僚资本之鞍山铁公司事实上亦已停工。
