    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 9th: The headquarters of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army has issued a communique on the 50-day Summer Offensive, stating that our army's Summer Offensive began on May 13th, launching simultaneous offensive operations against the enemy on the eastern, western, southern Manchuria, as well as the Rehe and eastern Hebei battlefields. By July 1st, after 50 days, we completely shattered the enemy's plan to divide our base areas in eastern, western, southern Manchuria, and the Jehol-Chahar-Liaoning area, as well as their so-called "mobile defense" deployment. We also dealt a severe blow to the enemy entrenched in Siping, forcing the enemy to retreat and consolidate in the narrow corridor area of the central and Beining Railway lines, adopting a so-called "key defense." By this point, the areas occupied by the enemy after the Siping campaign last year, except for a few large cities, have been liberated, thereby changing the entire situation in the Northeast, creating more favorable conditions for our army's future operations, and achieving brilliant results. Preliminary statistics are as follows:

    (1) Annihilated over 82,000 enemies. Killed enemy officers and soldiers, including Feng Zongyi, Chief of Staff of the 71st Army, Han Zengdong, Commander of the 88th Division, Ren Xiaozong, Deputy Commander of the 21st Division of the 60th Army, and Wang Jing'an, Commander of the Independent 3rd Division, totaling 23,191; captured Chen Kaiwen, Commander of the 184th Division of the 60th Army, Zou Lin, Deputy Commander of the 91st Division of the 71st Army, Chen Chengxiang, Deputy Commander of the Qing 2nd Division, and 46 officers above the rank of colonel, and 58,900 other officers and soldiers below the rank of colonel, totaling the strength of ten divisions. Among them, the enemy's regular army divisions completely annihilated were the 88th and 91st Divisions of the 71st Army, and the Provisional 21st and 184th Divisions of the 60th Army. Units annihilated at the regiment level or above included the 90th Regiment of the New 30th Division of the New 1st Army, the 112th Regiment of the New 38th Division, the Special Service Regiment directly under the 71st Army, and two regiments of the 87th Division, the 3rd Regiment of the Provisional 20th Division of the 93rd Army, and one regiment and one battalion of the 54th Division of the 13th Army.

    (2) Enemy local troops annihilated in batches included the Qing 2nd Division, Provisional 3rd Division, Independent 3rd Division, Puppet 3rd Army, 8th Regiment, 2nd Security Regiment, 6th Security Regiment, 7th Security Regiment, 17th Security Regiment, Changli Security Regiment, etc., totaling over 26,700.

Six cities, including Changli, Faku, Benxi, Changtu, Kaiyuan, and Gongzhuling, were reoccupied by the enemy after being recovered. The area of the aforementioned recovered areas, excluding eastern Hebei, totals over 166,000 square kilometers, accounting for more than half of the total area of 288,500 square kilometers in the KMT-occupied Northeast. The liberated people number about ten million, equal to half of the original twenty million population in the KMT-occupied Northeast, controlling over 2,500 li of railways, accounting for about two-thirds of the railways in the KMT-occupied Northeast.

    (4) Captured American-style weapons: 13 howitzers, 35 mountain guns, 1 anti-aircraft gun, 1 direct-fire gun, 43 anti-tank guns, 105 rocket launchers, 140 mortars, 336 60mm mortars, 195 grenade launchers, 18 anti-tank rifles, 3 anti-aircraft machine guns, 421 heavy machine guns, 1,924 light machine guns, 2,708 submachine guns, 28,955 rifles and pistols, 165 vehicles, over 200,000 artillery shells, and over 10 million rounds of ammunition.

    东北夏季攻势中
    我军歼敌十万
    收复县城三十六座
    【新华社东北前线九日电】东北民主联军总部顷发表夏季攻势五十天之作战公报称：我军夏季攻势自五月十三日开始，在东西南满及热河、冀东各个战场上，同时展开对敌进攻作战，至七月一日止，历时五十天，完全粉碎了敌军对我东西南北满及冀察热辽各根据地的分割计划与其所谓“机动守备”的布置，并给了据守四平重点之敌以严重打击，使敌军于败退之余，被迫收缩于中路及北宁路之狭长走廊地带，转取所谓“重点防御”。至此，去年四平战役后敌军所侵占之地区，除几个大城市外，均已重获解放，从而改变了东北整个局势。创造了今后我军作战的更加有利条件，获得了辉煌战果。初步统计如下：
    （一）歼敌八万二千余。毙敌七十一军参谋长冯宗毅、八十八师师长韩增栋、六十军二十一师副师长任孝宗、独三师师长王景安等以下官兵二万三千一百九十一名；俘敌六十军一八四师师长陈开文、七十一军九十一师副师长邹麟、青二师副师长陈呈祥及校级以上军官四十六名，及其他校级以下官兵五万八千九百名。共合十个师兵力。其中敌正规军整师被歼者为七十一军之八十八师、九十一师、六十军之暂二十一师、一八四师。被歼一个团以上者为新一军新三十师之九十团，新三十八师之一一二团，七十一军直属特务团及八十七师之两个团，九十三军暂二十师之第三团，十三军五十四师之一个团另一个营。
    （二）敌地方部队整批被歼者，包括青二师、暂三师、独三师、伪三军、第八团、保二团、保六团、保七团、保十七团、昌黎保安团等部，共二万六千七百余。
    （三）收复县城四十二座，计为围场、双山、康平、怀德、昌黎、公主岭、通辽、梨树、双阳、通化、辽源、法库、海龙、迁安、抚宁、东丰、西丰、桦甸、磐石、昌图、开原、清原、新宾、西安、岫严、亦峰、宽甸、宁城、伊通、凤城、盖平、庄河、复县、安东、建平、本溪、遵化、平谷、蓟县、三河、凌源、北票。收复后被敌重占者有昌黎、法库、本溪、昌图、开原、公主岭等六座城。上述收复地区除冀东外，面积共计十六万六千余平方公里，占东北蒋占区全部面积二十八万八千五百余平方公里之一半以上。被解放之人民约千万，等于原东北蒋占区人口两千万之一半，控制铁路两千五百余里，约为蒋占东北铁路三分之二。
    （四）缴获美式武器：榴弹炮十三门、山炮三十五门、机关炮一门、平射炮一门、战防炮四十三门、火箭炮一百零五门、迫击炮一百四十门、六○炮三百三十六门、掷弹筒一百九十五个，战防枪十八挺、高射机枪三挺、重机枪四百二十一挺、轻机枪一千九百廿四挺，冲锋枪二千七百零八支，长短枪二万八千九百五十五支。汽车一百六十五辆，炮弹二十余万发、子弹千余万发。击毁坦克六辆，击落敌机五架，卤获其他物资无算。
