Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. Comprehensive report: Just as Indonesia was preparing to fully resist the Netherlands' frantic general offensive, the US and British imperialists suddenly came out to openly intervene, attempting to pressure Indonesia into succumbing to the Dutch colonial demands. It is reported that the US and British governments simultaneously sent a note to Indonesia, threatening Indonesia to accept the Dutch proposal to organize a provisional government of the Indonesian Federation. Encouraged by the US and Britain, Dutch military commander Spoor has ordered his troops to launch attacks on all fronts on the 30th and to carry out large-scale arrests and searches of "suspicious" residences. Many Indonesian newspapers have widely criticized the US and Britain's reckless intervention.
