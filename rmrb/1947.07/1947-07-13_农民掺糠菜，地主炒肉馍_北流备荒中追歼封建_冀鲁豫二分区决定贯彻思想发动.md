    Peasants Eat Bran and Vegetables, Landlords Fry Meat Buns
    Chasing Down Feudalism in Beiliu's Famine Relief
    The Second Sub-district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan Decides to Implement Ideological Mobilization
    [Report from this newspaper in Licheng] After the Beiliu Village visited the disaster area, it proposed comparing life with the landlords, and found that the landlords' lives were still higher than those of ordinary peasants. In order to save food during the famine, the peasants ate bran and vegetables, and their lives were very hard, but the landlords still ate and drank lavishly. For example, the landlord Duan Fude still fried pork and ate ramen, Zhang Weixian ate steamed oil buns, and Duan Jiagui's family ate dumplings. The village slaughtered a pig during the Dragon Boat Festival, and it was all eaten by the landlords. Some landlords still wore city-made cloth, lived in good houses and kilns, cultivated good land, and even fed livestock. After further comparison, everything was higher than the peasants. Everyone realized the cunning of the landlords. During the rent reduction campaign last winter, the landlords hid good clothes and good things, so they were not thoroughly struggled against, and the feudal tails still existed. The peasants proposed to struggle repeatedly and completely sever the feudal tails. They accepted the landlords' experience of digging air-raid shelters last winter and adopted the methods of "pouring boiling water on rats" and "digging out the heart of the tiger" to launch a fierce struggle. Therefore, the leadership supported the peasants and made the decision for them. On the night of the 29th of last month, a meeting of activists was immediately convened, and the masses were mobilized at the same time, and the landlords were promptly detained. A total of 22 landlords were forced to hand over 74 dan and 1.9 sheng (large measure) of grain, 388 jin of cotton, 228 silver dollars, 89 pearls, 2 donkeys, 4 cattle, 39 kilns, 28 houses, and 166 mu of land were exchanged with the landlords. The land of 20 mu of landlords was seized, and countless other utensils, clothing, and cloth were seized. The land was first distributed to 4 families of military dependents, 2 families of cadres, and 36 families of land-poor peasants. Other gains are being discussed. (Dong Kui)
    [Report from this newspaper] After the counties of Shou, Fan, and Zhangqiu in the Second Sub-district of Hebei-Shandong-Henan victoriously completed and exceeded the conscription task, the cadres generally breathed a sigh of relief, believing that land reform had "no prospects" and could be "rested," hindering the continued deepening of the re-examination movement. In view of this situation, the Second District Committee convened a meeting of activists to specifically study and analyze the dynamics of the landlord class, arousing self-criticism among all cadres and activists, revitalizing their fighting spirit, and vowing to eliminate the feudal remnants completely and thoroughly complete the land reform.
    At the meeting, the situation reports from various counties generally revealed three phenomena: (1) The "fleshy" landlords were struggled against fiercely, while some truly feudal stubborn households and so-called "enlightened" landlords were struggled against very lightly; (2) The landlords were afraid of outside cadres, but not afraid of local village cadres and the masses (for example, the landlord of × village said: "The Party School is gone, the storm has passed!"); (3) After the conscription movement, the landlords seized the opportunity of our slackness and actively launched a counterattack. The meeting also specifically studied several typical "enlightened" and "progressive" landlords: Liu Yongke in the first district of Shouzhang, a family of seven with more than 40 mu of land, was a bankrupt landlord. He had been a puppet township chief and is now very attentive to our county and district cadres. He is very active in superficial work such as fundraising and慰劳 [comforting troops and their families]; During this conscription movement, he also sent his son to join the army and became a model. He was not touched during the land reform and the initial review. After further research into his historical activities, a series of destructive facts were discovered: During the democratic livelihood movement (hired peasants' movement), he joined forces with landlords in several villages to petition and resist rent reduction and debt clearing; He mobilized village cadres to oppose the district chief, sow discord, and attack and isolate the main activists in the village; In front of the masses, he boasted a lot, saying that the county magistrate and district chief were on good terms with him, using this to threaten the masses. While sending his son to join the army, he also told his youngest son to destroy the school... Peeling back the skin, it turned out that the so-called "progress" and "enlightenment" of the landlords were all deceptive tricks, deeply alerting all cadres and activists. At this time, the leadership put forward: "Liu Yongke is a bad person, why didn't we realize it in the past?" "We also moved stones in the past, why didn't we move them all? Can simply moving stones solve the problem?" Du Huashan, a cadre of the Public Security Bureau, self-criticized: "I was very unhappy when I arrested Xin Shouting in the past. I only saw that he was helpful to the public security, but I didn't see his side of suppressing the masses and didn't start from the masses." Another comrade criticized himself: "When I first distributed the land, I felt that the struggle was very thorough. When I cleared the accounts, a large amount of hidden wealth was found, and I thought it was really thorough this time. In fact, there is insufficient understanding of the arduousness of today's land reform and the cunning and insidiousness of the landlord class!" After the self-criticism, it was unanimously agreed that only by standing closely with the masses and implementing the mass line of ideological mobilization can we remove all the large and small stones of various colors and completely complete the land reform.

    农民掺糠菜，地主炒肉馍
    北流备荒中追歼封建
    冀鲁豫二分区决定贯彻思想发动
    【本报黎城讯】北流村经过访灾荒后，提出与地主对比生活，发现地主生活仍高于一般农民，农民为了节约渡荒，都吃糠掺菜，生活甚为刻苦，但地主却仍然大吃二喝，如地主段复德仍然炒猪肉，吃拉面，张委贤吃的是蒸油卷，段甲贵家里吃的是饺子。过端午村里杀了一个猪，全部是地主吃了，地主有的还穿的是市布，住的是好房好窑，种的是好地，有的还喂着牲口。经更进一步对比，一切都比农民高，大家认识了地主的狡猾，在去冬查减时地主把好衣服好东西都藏了，所以没有斗彻底，封建尾巴依然存在。农民提出要反复斗争，彻底割绝封建尾巴，接受了地主在去冬都打下防空洞的经验，采用了“滚水灌老鼠”与“猛虎挖心”的办法，猛然开展斗争。于是领导上给农民撑腰作主，上月二十九日黑夜当即召开了积极分子会，同时发动了群众，及时把地主扣起来。共二十二家地主割出粮食七十四石一斗九升大斗）。棉花三百八十八斤，银元二百二十八元，珍珠八十九个，驴二头，牛四头，窑三十九眼，房二十八间，与地主换地一百六十六亩，下了地主地二十亩，其他用具衣被布匹无算。土地先分换给四户抗属、二户干属及三十六户少地农民，其他一切果实正在评议中。（东魁）
    【本报讯】冀鲁豫二分区寿、范、张秋等县，胜利的完成并超过参军任务后，干部普遍松了一口气，认为土地改革已“没搞头”，可以“歇一歇”了，妨碍着复查运动的继续深入。根据这种情况，二地委召开了活动分子会，专门研究分析地主阶级的动态，引起全体干部活动分子自我检讨，重振斗志，誓把封建残余消灭净尽，彻底完成土地改革为止。
    会上各县情况汇报中，普遍发现三种现象：（一）肉头地主斗的厉害，一部分真正封建圪ｄā＠①户及所谓“开明”地主斗的很轻；（二）地主怕外来干部，不怕本村干部与群众，（例如×村地主说：“党校走了，风头过去啦”！）；（三）参军运动后，地主抓我们松懈的空子，积极活动反攻。会上并专门研究了几个典型的“开明”“进步”地主：寿张一区的刘永珂，七口人，四十多亩地，是个破落地主，曾当过伪乡长，现在对我们县区干部逢迎备至；对募捐、慰劳等表面工作很积极；这次参军运动他又把儿子送去参军，当了模范。土地改革与初次的复查中，都没动他。经进一步研究他的历史活动时，即发现了一连串的破坏事实；民主民生运动中（雇佃贫运动），他曾联合几个村的地主请愿，抵抗减租清债；活动村干部反对区长，挑拨离间，打击和孤立村中的主要积极分子；在群众面前则大吹大擂，说什么县长、区长跟自己要好，以此威胁群众，他一面送子参军，一面又叫小儿破坏学校……………剥开皮来看，原来地主的所谓“进步”“开明”都是骗人的把戏，深入警惕了全体干部活动分子，领导上这时便提出：“刘永珂是坏人，为什么过去咱们认识不到？”“过去咱也搬过石头，为什么没有全搬掉？单纯搬石头能不能解决问题？”公安局干部杜华山自我检讨说：“过去抓辛寿亭，我很不高兴，我只看到他对公安有帮助，没看到他镇压群众一面，没有从群众出发。”另一同志检讨说：“初次分土地时，我便觉得斗争很彻底啦，等到清查时，又搞出大批浮财，我认为这回可真彻底啦。事实上是对今天土地改革的艰苦性、对地主阶级的狡猾阴险认识不足！”经过检讨后，一致认为只有紧紧的跟群众站在一起，贯彻思想发动的群众路线，才能搬掉一切大大小小各色各样的石头，彻底完成土地改革。（力文、剑虹）
