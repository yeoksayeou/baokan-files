    Soldiers and Civilians Join Forces in Crash Planting
    Completing Planting One Day Early
    Ministry of Health Suspends Office Work to Participate in Crash Planting
    [Our Newspaper's News] After the rain on July 9th, in order to help the masses complete the planting task ahead of schedule, the Rear Service Department of the Military Region decided that starting from the 10th, all units would suspend office work for three days and fully assist the villagers in station with crash planting. As early as the evening of the 9th, they coordinated with village cadres to carry out careful planning and decided that all soldiers and civilians would join forces to crash plant. Through the active efforts of the 10th, 11th, and the morning of the 12th for two and a half days, the soldiers and civilians planted a total of 4,357 mu, with only more than 30 mu not yet planted. In two and a half days, the Ministry of Health participated with a total of 135 people and 21 animals, helping the masses to plant more than 900 mu. They assisted the stationed village in completing the planting task one day ahead of schedule, and all the villagers jumped and rejoiced. (Shi Junying)
    [Our Newspaper's Yaoshan News] Because Chengbeili is surrounded by desert, the lives of the masses have been difficult for many years. This year, they received government loans, and their enthusiasm for production has increased. In addition, with the practical help of bank comrades, the masses' thinking has been cleared, and mutual aid and large-scale labor exchange have been organized. They also helped the masses by pushing water carts, repairing wells, watering fields, and planting seedlings, and all the villagers have become energetic, breaking away from the mentality of relying on heaven's will and waiting. After the recent rainfall, bank comrades and all the villagers were mobilized, and everyone competed to participate in crash planting, with more than 60 women participating in the main labor. Nie Suizi, the leader of the fourth team, completed the crash planting of his team ahead of schedule. During the crash planting, Zhu Bani and Nie Suizi were both elected as models by the masses. In the three days after the rain, more than 600 mu were planted, and all the sandy land that could be cultivated was planted.

    【本报尧山讯】城北里因周围尽系沙漠，群众历年生活艰苦，今年得到政府贷款，生产情绪提高，又加银行同志的切实帮助，打通群众思想，组织了互助大变工，及给群众推水车修井浇田点苗，全村群众都带起劲来，打破了靠天认命等待思想。最近落雨后，银行同志与全村群众总动员，个个争先参加抢种，妇女六十余名参加了主要劳动。第四队队长聂遂子提前完成本队抢种，在抢种中祝八妮、聂遂子均被群众推为模范。下雨后的三日内共种六百余亩，把所能生产的沙地均一一种上。
