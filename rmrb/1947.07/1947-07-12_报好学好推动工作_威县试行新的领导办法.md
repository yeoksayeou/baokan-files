    Reporting and Learning Well to Promote Work
    Weixian County Implements New Leadership Methods
    [Reported by this newspaper] Recently, the Weixian County Committee convened a district joint meeting, using the spirit of awarding merit and commendation, and employing the methods of "reporting well" and "learning well" to study the work of drought prevention and disaster preparedness, and production and frugality since the start of the Great Production Campaign in each district. From "reporting well," it was learned that each district had carried out large-scale mobilization for crash planting. According to incomplete statistics from six districts, 1,620 mutual aid teams were organized; four districts eliminated 3,120 mu of barren land; seven districts planted 6,782 mu of cotton; and all sorghum and cotton in the county had been hoed, successfully completing the wheat harvest. Following "reporting well," each district enthusiastically launched "learning well." After a day of deliberation, based on the situation in each district, directions for further promoting production and frugality were proposed. After summarizing by the County Committee, the following points were emphasized: (1) Continue to eliminate all wasteland, conduct in-depth surveys of barren land, quickly plant late seedlings, promote fertilizer accumulation and additional hoeing. Implement frugality for disaster preparedness, change old customs, provide mutual assistance for weddings and funerals, quit smoking and drinking, make household plans, and establish village and district covenants to save financial expenditure, eliminate waste, and launch pest control (insect pests, rodent pests, etc.) campaigns. (2) Organize, conserve labor, strive for deep plowing and careful cultivation, develop household handicrafts and other side occupations (weaving towels, salt extraction, transportation, etc.) to achieve increased production. Village cadres must take the lead and Party members must be the core, so that every village has mutual assistance. Initially, it can start with simple "odd jobs" temporary mutual assistance, gradually improving and learning from the example of Shengfotang. (3) Regarding production leadership, it was emphasized that understanding the masses' thinking is essential. It is necessary to reward the active, hold production symposiums, labor hero conferences, and small district and village joint meetings from the village and district to the county, universally launch the "learning well" campaign, fully utilize the county's small newspaper, village public blackboards, radio stations, and cartoon slogans to commend models, and vigorously mobilize, so that every village has models and every industry produces "champions." Leaders at all levels must directly participate in production, strictly control themselves, conscientiously practice frugality, deeply lead the masses, discover and create model examples, use concrete facts as propaganda content, and convene mass production and frugality plans and inspections. Finally, all ten districts in the county voted for models on a district basis. Both Districts Seven and Nine were elected as models with eight votes each. Everyone was sincerely convinced, saying, "Don't worry about not knowing good products, only worry about comparing products, other people's work is really good!"

    威县试行新的领导办法
    【本报讯】日前威县县委会召开的区联合会上，以立功表彰的精神，用“报好”“学好”的办法，研究了各区大生产以来的防旱备荒、生产节约等工作。从“报好”中了解到各区都大规模的进行了突击抢种的动员，据六个区不完全统计，组织互助组一千六百二十个；四个区消灭白荒地三千一百二十亩；七个区战种棉花六千七百八十二亩；全县高粱、棉花全都锄过，胜利完成麦收。继“报好”之后，各区热烈展开“学好”，经一天酝酿，根据各区情况，提出今后进一步推动生产节约的方向，经县委归纳，着重指出以下几点：（一）继续消灭一切荒地，深入查荒，迅速抢种晚苗，提倡积肥、加锄。贯彻节约备荒，改变旧规矩，婚丧互助、戒烟戒酒，作按家计划，订村、区公约，节省财政开支，杜绝浪费，展开除害（虫害，鼠害等）运动。（二）组织起来，节余劳力，努力做到深耕细作，发展家庭手工业和其他副业（织毛巾，淋盐，运输等），达到增产目的。要村干带头，党员为核心，使村村有互助。开始可从简单的“碰碰活”临时互助，逐渐提高，向圣佛堂看齐。（三）关于生产领导，强调掌握群众思想，必须奖励积极，从村区到县举行生产座谈、劳英大会、小区村联会，普遍展开“学好”运动，充分利用县小报、各村大众黑板报、广播台、漫画标语奖励模范，大力动员，做到村村有模范，行行出“状元”。各级领导者必须直接参加生产，严格自己认真节约，深入领导群众，发现创造模范典型，用具体事实作宣传内容，召开群众性的生产节约计划和检查。最后全县十个区以区为单位投票选举模范，七、九两区都以八票当选模范，大家心悦诚服的说：“不怕不识货，只怕货比货，人家的工作真好！”
