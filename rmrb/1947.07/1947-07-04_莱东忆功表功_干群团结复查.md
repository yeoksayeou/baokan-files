Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 26th — In Laiyang Dong County, Jiaodong, a unity movement between cadres and the masses, involving remembering merits, evaluating achievements, and commending accomplishments, overcame the tendency of cadres towards rich-peasant thinking and successfully launched a re-examination. The methods are as follows: (1) In Heshan and Fushui districts, the process began with current affairs education, then remembering merits and commending achievements, followed by examining shortcomings, tracing the roots, and accusing the old society of its crimes, until the cadres were determined to correct their shortcomings. Some cadres who had gained excessive benefits returned the surplus, and efforts were then made to encourage further contributions. When examining shortcomings, cadres' ideological situations fell into three categories: First, those who already felt isolated and distressed in their work were willing to return the excessive benefits, but feared that the masses would not be satisfied and had concerns about face and prestige. Second, those who superficially acknowledged their shortcomings but were unwilling to return the benefits. Third, those who believed this was "killing the donkey after it finished grinding the mill" and had resistance in their emotions. The leadership adhered to the principle of never attacking, united the masses to supervise, and provided education and encouragement separately, calculating the losses from the revolution and their own losses, and pointing out the future to break through the thinking of the first two types of people, and then bringing along the third. Finally, the cadres changed from distress to joy and resolved to make further contributions to the masses. (2) Wangshi District thoroughly remembered merits and commended achievements, without examining shortcomings, to overcome negative aspects by promoting positive aspects. The steps were: First, fully remember merits and find achievements, combined with accusing the old society of its crimes. Second, mass evaluation and commendation of achievements. In addition to cadres recalling their own merits, the masses also helped to recall them and corrected the cadres' self-recollections. Then, both major and minor achievements were recorded in the merit book. The leadership should adhere to the principle that everyone has merits. Third, a grand ceremony was held to celebrate the achievements. Portraits were made of those with great merits, and reports of merit were written. Key activists took the lead in setting plans for adding more achievements, creating a revolutionary competition upsurge. In remembering merits and commending achievements, finding the merits of others revealed one's own shortcomings, and the masses recording the merits of others was like recording their own shortcomings. Therefore, it not only encouraged those with merits and great merits, but also educated those without merits and with small merits. Thus, after thoroughly commending achievements, cadres were determined to return to the village to transform their shortcomings, thoroughly re-examine, and make further contributions.

　　莱东忆功表功
  　干群团结复查
    【新华社山东二十六日电】胶东莱（阳）东县经过忆功评功表功的干部与群众团结运动，克服了干部富农思想倾向胜利开展复查。作法如下：（一）鹤山、富水区是先从时事教育着手，进而忆功表功，再检查缺点，追寻根源，控诉旧社会罪恶，直到干部决心纠正缺点，某些多得果实干部退出多得部分，再发动功上加功。检查缺点时，干部思想情况有三种：一、在工作中已深感孤立苦闷，愿意退出多得果实，但怕群众不满足并有情面威信等顾虑。二、囫囵吞枣的承认缺点，但不愿退出果实。三、认为这是“推完磨先杀驴”，情绪上有对抗。领导上掌握绝不打击原则，联合群众督促，分别予以教育鼓励，从对革命及自己损失上算帐，指出前途等打通一二种人思想，带起第三种人。最后干部从苦闷变成愉快，决心为群众再立功劳。（二）望石区是彻底忆功表功，不检查缺点，以发扬积极面克服消极面。步骤是：一、充分忆功找功并与控诉旧社会罪恶结合；二、群众性的评功表功，干部自忆外，群众还帮助回忆，并对干部的自忆加以校正，然后大小功绩均记上功劳簿，领导上要掌握人人都有功的原则。三、最后举行隆重典礼庆功。给功大的画像，写报功录，由骨干积极分子带头订功上加功计划，造成革命竞赛热潮。在忆功表功中，找出别人的功即显出自己的缺点，群众记下别人的功即如记下自己的缺点，从而不仅鼓舞了有功和功大者，也教育了无功和功小者，故经彻底表功后，干部都决心回村改造缺点，彻底复查再立功劳。
