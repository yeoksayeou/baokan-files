[This dispatch comes from the Taiyue News Agency on the 10th] Jincheng County's drought prevention and disaster preparation work has been progressing smoothly because the leadership promptly addressed some ideological concerns of the masses, and the entire county has been conducting meticulous disaster preparation calculations. During discussions on drought prevention and disaster preparation in Xuntou Village, Fifth District, the cadres and masses discovered the following thoughts: The elderly thought, "We live one day at a time, not knowing when we will die." The women said, "With the Eighth Route Army here, we don't have to worry about starving to death." The young people thought, "When the famine comes, we'll just pick up our carrying poles and go out to flee the famine again." Young women said, "Thinking about the famine of 1943 is really scary, we've suffered through it before." After the leadership discovered these thoughts, they first worked to clarify the thinking of the cadres, and then the thinking of the masses. Their method was to raise the problems one by one and let the masses discuss them. To the elderly with their reliance on heaven, they said, "Do you want to live or die? If you want to live, you have to fight against the drought." To the young people with their thoughts of escape, they asked, "Where are you going to run? There's drought everywhere, what will you do? Relying on the Eighth Route Army also requires you to get up and work hard yourself." The young women had a clearer understanding of the famine. After two days of discussion, it was unanimously agreed that there was no better way than to actively fight drought and prepare for disaster. After clarifying their thinking, they immediately took action. The whole village made precise calculations and plans. First, they gathered all the money earned from sideline occupations to buy back 4,800 jin of bean cake, and also gathered 3,000 jin of wild vegetables. There is a coal kiln with over 4,000 baskets of coal remaining. Valued at 70 yuan per basket, they sold it to buy back bean cake. Now they can produce 200 baskets a day, which, after solving the village's coal burning problem, can earn about 5,000 yuan per day. They plan to open another stone kiln and organize ten carts to transport [stone?], 5,000 jin per day, which can earn 225,000 yuan. This year's wheat harvest can supply three months of use. If the wheat is exchanged for miscellaneous grains or bean cake, it can last for six months. Each person should plant five pumpkin plants, which, supplemented with wild vegetables, will be enough to eat for a month. Adding the 4,800 jin of bean cake, they can get through to the end of the year. After the rain on the 22nd, all the men and women in the village mobilized again and replanted 670 mu of late autumn crops in five days. The Third District has also replanted 3,848 mu of the 9,271 mu of land that had no seedlings. A challenge to save even more has been initiated, with each person saving two *guanhe* of millet per day.

    晋城五区峋头村
    雨后全村总动员
    抢种晚秋六百亩
    【本报太岳十日电】晋城防旱备荒工作，由于领导上及时解决了群众思想上一些顾虑，全县普遍进行精确计算的备荒工作。五区峋头村全体干部群众在讨论防旱备荒中，发现有以下几种思想：老年人是“活一天说一天，不知那天就死啦”。老婆们说：“有八路军在不怕饿死人。”青年人是“灾荒来了，不过再担上圪篱出去逃荒吧。”青年妇女说：“想起四三年的灾荒来实在怕，咱可受过啦。”领导上发现这些思想后，首先打通干部思想，然后打通群众思想。他们的办法是把问题一个一个提出来，让群众讨论，对老人的靠天思想是：“你究竟是要死要活？要活的话就得和旱灾作斗争。”对年青人的逃跑思想提出：“你往那里跑？到处旱灾，你怎样办？依靠八路军也得自己起来努力干。”年青妇女认识灾荒比较明确。经过两天的讨论，一致认为除了积极起来抗旱备荒，再没有什么好办法。思想打通后，立即行动起来，全村做了精确计算与计划，首先集合全村副业赚的款买回豆饼四千八百斤，又打野菜三千斤。有煤窑一座，尚存煤四千多篓，每篓七十元计，出卖了买回豆饼。现在每天可出二百篓，除解决全村烧煤问题，每天可赚五千元左右。计划再开一个石窑组织十辆车运＠①，每天五千斤，计可赚二十二万五千元。今年收麦可供三个月用，如把麦换成杂粮或豆饼就能吃六个月。每个人要种活五棵南瓜，添上野菜也够吃一个月。再加上四千八百斤豆饼，就可以到年底。二十二号下雨后，全村男女又总动员，五天内回茬晚秋六百七十亩。三区并将没苗地九二七一亩已补种三八四八亩。节约方面更掀起挑战，每人每天节约小米二官合。
