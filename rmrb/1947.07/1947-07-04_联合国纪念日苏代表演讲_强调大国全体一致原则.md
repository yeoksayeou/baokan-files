The speaker representing the Soviet Union was Gromyko, who emphasized in his speech that one of the main principles of the United Nations organization is the principle of unanimity among the great powers in deciding all issues related to peace. Gromyko pointed out that only two years have passed since the signing of the United Nations Charter, so now is not the time to draw final conclusions about the activities of the United Nations. Gromyko concluded, "I hope that in its future activities, the United Nations will have sufficient strength to overcome some of its current shortcomings and become an effective tool for striving for peace and security."
