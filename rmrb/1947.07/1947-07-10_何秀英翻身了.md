　　He Xiuying Has Turned Over
　　He Xiuying is the Women's Association Director of Dongguan Road in the first district of Shouzhang. She suffered poverty and hardship from a young age. In the spring of her 30th year, she ate black bean husks and wild vegetables. The landlord Yue Chaorui fed his livestock green beans but wouldn't lend any to the poor. She was so poor that she had to sell two mu of land.
　　Yue Chaorui said, "I knew you couldn't avoid selling land. I had this planned all along. Give me the land." The land was sold to him, but he only gave her half the money. Yue Chaorui said, "You're selling the land to eat. You can't eat it all at once, and it's just sitting there anyway. Let's give you half the money first." When grain prices soared, and money became worthless, Yue Chaorui repaid her the original amount, essentially swindling her out of more than two hundred yuan.
　　Such a poor life continued for twenty-nine years. In the thirty-third year of the Republic of China, the Eighth Route Army liberated Shouzhang City. She heard that the poor could turn over and reduce rent and interest, so she rushed home on the fifth day of the second lunar month. The village assigned her a small thatched cottage. Both she and her husband joined the "Turning Over" Association, and in a few days, they were allocated one stone and two dou of wheat and beans. The first women's association leader in the village couldn't stand up to the landlord, so everyone elected her as the women's association director. She became an activist leading the masses to turn over.
　　This year in March, during the second thorough investigation of landlords, she led the women's association for five consecutive days and nights without sleep, her eyes became inflamed. As a result, seven hundred pieces of clothing were found. Everyone told her to rest, but she kept leading the work. When distributing items, she first asked everyone for their opinions, and everyone was happy. They also elected her as a model of turning over.
　　Now she lives in a bright, spacious three-room northern house. Looking inside, there is a newly distributed large wooden bed with a large mosquito net, a dressing mirror, and a varnished standing cupboard. The bed is covered with a large floral mat, and there's a tall, pointed pile of new wheat, measuring twelve chi high, along with a spinning wheel and a large water vat. She said, "The year we returned home, there wasn't a clod of earth to our name. Now we have twelve mu of land. This year, we harvested fourteen sacks (about 120 jin of wheat per sack). On the day of threshing the wheat, the family was as happy as if they were drunk. The old grandmother, who is over sixty and blind, touched the big wheat pile and said, "I'm useless and can't see, but I'm so happy to hear you say it. Our ancestors never harvested so much wheat."
　　After the first rain, the mutual aid teams in the whole village planted beans, the bean sprouts are more than three cun high, and the sorghum has been hoed twice. Even the old grandmother, who is blind, spins cotton on the spinning wheel all day long, spinning more than four liang of thread every day, and spun enough thread for one hundred and thirty chi of cloth in the spring.
　　Before the wheat harvest, the whole district held a celebration of turning over, and she mobilized her husband to join the army. She said, "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, I have turned over. Our family is of one mind. Even after I die, I will never forget the boundless grace of Chairman Mao."

### 何秀英翻身了

　　何秀英翻身了
    何秀英是寿张一区东关路的妇会主任，从小就受穷受苦，三十年春上吃着黑豆糠野菜，地主岳朝瑞用绿豆喂牲口也不借一点给穷人。穷得他只好卖了二亩地。
    岳朝瑞说：“就知道您脱不了卖地，我早就留着一手，地给我吧”。地卖给他了，但又硬着只给一半钱。岳朝瑞说：“你卖地为了吃，一口吃不了，放着也是放着，先给一半钱吧。”麦里粮食大涨，钱不值钱，岳朝瑞按原数还她，又算讹去了二百多元。
    象这样的穷日子一直过了二十九年。民国三十三年八路军打开了寿张城，她听说穷人翻身，减租减息，二月大初五便赶着回家了。村里给她按插了一间小草房，她两口子都在了翻身会，不几天分到了麦子豆子一石二斗。村里的第一个妇女会长跟地主揭不开脸，大家就选她当了妇会长。她就成了领导群众翻身的积极分子了。
    今年三月二次清查地主，她领着妇会接连着熬了五天五夜没睡着，眼都熬烂了。结果查出七百件衣裳，大伙叫她歇歇，她还是领着干。分东西先让大伙提意见，大家挑，大家都满心高兴，又选她当了翻身模范。
    现在她住着一座亮堂堂的三间大北屋，到屋里看看，屋里放着新分的大木床，床上撑着大蚊帐，还有穿衣镜，一个油漆的立厨。床上铺着大花席，一丈二尺高的尖溜溜的一大囤新麦，还有纺花车、大水缸等。她说：“俺回家那年地垄皆无，现下有十二亩地了，今年收了十四布袋（一袋约一百二十斤麦子），打麦的那天，家人喜的象喝醉酒。六十多岁瞎了双眼的老奶奶用手摸着大麦囤说：“我不中用了，看不见了，听你说我也高兴透了。咱老辈里也没收成过这样多麦子。”
    下第一场雨时，全庄上互助组便把豆子种上啦，豆苗有三寸多高，高粱也锄了两遍，连瞎了双眼的老奶奶、一天到晚转的棉花车嗡嗡响，每天能纺四两多线，一春天纺了一百三十尺布的线子。
    麦前全区开庆祝翻身大会，她便动员了自己的丈夫参军，她说：“我在共产党的领导下翻了身，俺老少一家人都只剩了一条心，俺死后也忘不了天高地厚的毛主席”。
