　　Jinnan Masses
　　Practice Thrift After Wheat Harvest
　　[This newspaper's Jinnan dispatch, 29th] The masses in various places are earnestly preparing for famine and practicing thrift. The entire masses of Wuxun Er Zhao Langzhai set a rule during the wheat harvest: eating wheat mixed with coarse grains and chaff or elm leaves, proposing "saving the surplus, not the minimum," and not eating wheat extravagantly after the harvest. The blackboard newspaper in Wang Erdi Village publishes the names of families who are doing a good job of practicing thrift and preparing for famine every day. The cadres and members of Gu Xian Village in the Ninth District of Wei County jointly decided to "abstain from smoking and drinking, and those who violate this will be fined by carrying water for the families of the martyrs for one day." The two wine shops closed their doors voluntarily, and the fourteen village cadres alone saved 50,000 yuan in ten days. The concrete effect of thrift has enlightened the masses, and they are determined to continue practicing thrift. Qiu County suffered the most severe drought in 1943. After recalling the drought, a wave of famine preparation quickly rose. Villages collected wild vegetables and tree leaves, and voluntarily reduced the amount of grain eaten. For example, Qingping of Dongmuyan Village recalled that his father starved to death in the famine, so he discussed thrift with his mother-in-law. In the past, seven steamed buns were made from one bowl of noodles, but now fourteen are steamed with vegetables mixed in. Every family in Xishi Yangu set a thrift plan, changing two meals a day, mixing fine chaff into the buns, not allowing children to eat snacks, and letting children collect wild vegetables.

　　冀南群众
  　麦后节约
    【本报冀南二十九日电】各地群众认真备荒节约，武训二赵郎砦全体群众在麦收中定了一个规矩，吃麦掺粗粮和糠或榆叶，提出：“省囤尖不省囤底”，收了麦不能横的竖的光吃。王二砥村的黑板报每日登载着节约备荒好的人家。威县九区固献村干和会员共同决议“戒烟酒，犯者罚给抗属担水一天”，两家卖酒的自动关门了，仅十四个村干十天即省五万元。具体节约的实效，打通了群众的思想，都决心把节约持续下去。邱县三十二年灾荒最重，经过回忆灾荒后，备荒很快造成热潮，各村采集野菜树叶，自动减少吃粮数目。如东目岩庆平家想起他爹爹灾荒中饿死，就和婆母计议节约，过去一碗面蒸七个窝窝，现掺菜蒸十四个。西石彦固家家订节约计划，每家改两顿饭，窝窝掺细糠，不叫孩子吃零食，并让孩子采野菜。
