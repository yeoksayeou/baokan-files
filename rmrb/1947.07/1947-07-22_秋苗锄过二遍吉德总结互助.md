[This report was transmitted from Taiyue on the 20th of this month.] Yangcheng's Jide Village, in summarizing the first half of the year's production and arranging the second half's work, created a method of reviewing and summarizing first at the family and individual level, and then at the mutual aid group and village level. Li Fa-fu, the chairman of the Farmers' Association, convened a family meeting to summarize the first half of the year's production. In agriculture, 108 workdays were saved; in sideline production, the average income was 7,000 yuan per person for half a year. After precise calculations, the family, excluding two children whose labor was not counted, only utilized half of the potential of the three full laborers and one half laborer. The reason was that although they had enthusiasm for production, they did not formulate a plan for prosperity, resulting in the lack of integration between agriculture and sideline occupations. After Li Fa-fu's summary, he promoted widespread summarizing throughout the village. He then held a second family meeting to study the production and prosperity plan for the second half of the year, paying full attention to utilizing the remaining labor force and expanding production. For example, his mother, Zhang Xiaozhi, planned to make shoes for half a month, ensuring that she would spin two liang of thread every day and weave thirteen bolts of cloth in half a year. Li Fa-fu himself planned to work in the fields for sixty days, attend meetings and work in the office for sixty days, and planned to engage in transportation and sideline production worth 40,000 yuan for the rest of the time. This plan greatly influenced and promoted the entire village.

[This report was transmitted from Taiyue on the 20th of this month.] The achievements of Jide Village in summarizing half a year's production are: first, overcoming the administrative orders of forced formation of mutual aid groups last year, truly achieving voluntary association: four hundred and thirty male full and half laborers aged seventeen to fifty have been 100% organized; three hundred and fifty-three female full and half laborers of the same age have been 33% organized; and the number of elderly people over fifty-six years old and children aged fifteen to nine who have been organized has also reached as much as 32%. Secondly, this year, two workdays saving one workday has been generally achieved. The family of Li Fa-fu, chairman of the Farmers' Association, did not finish weeding the autumn fields in a month last year, but this year it was completed in only thirteen days. This year, the entire village's four thousand four hundred and ninety-two mu and three fen of land (including the six unorganized households) has generally achieved plowing twice per mu, and some parts have been plowed three times. The autumn seedlings have all been weeded twice. Due to labor saving, an average of sixty dan of manure per mu has been applied, and after three thorough rains, the grain seedlings have grown to more than three chi high, and the jiao seedlings have also grown to two or three chi high. Although sixty-six people participated in the war and contributed labor this year, production has exceeded any previous year. In production, seventeen model figures such as Liu Yinhua and Zhang Siyin, a fifty-year-old military dependent, emerged. Good results have also been achieved in sideline production; in the past half year, the total income from spinning, weaving, transportation, silkworm breeding, pig raising, and beekeeping has been more than 7.39 million yuan. The average sideline income per person for half a year is 4,530 yuan.

　　秋苗锄过二遍吉德总结互助
    【本报太岳二十日电】阳城吉德村，在总结前半年和布置后半年生产工作时，创造了先从家庭和个人为单位，再到互助组及全村的检讨总结办法。农会主席李法傅，召集了个家庭会议，总结前半年的生产，在农业上，省工一百零八个；在副业生产上，半年平均每人收入七千元。精确计算下来，全家除两个小孩不计劳力外，其他三个全劳力一个半劳力，仅只发挥了一半的作用，原因是虽有生产热情，但没有订发家计划，致使农业副业没有结合互助。李法傅总结后，推动了全村纷纷总结，他又第二次开家庭会，研究了后半年的生产发家计划，充分注意了发挥剩余劳力，扩大生产。例如他妈张小枝自己计划除过半个月做鞋，保证每天纺线二两、半年织布十三匹，李法傅本人计划上地六十天，开会办公六十天，其余计划搞运输副业生产四万元。这个计划又大大的影响与推动了全村。
    【本报太岳二十日电】吉德村总结半年生产，成绩是首先克服了去年的行政命令强编互助组，真正达到了自愿结合：十七岁以上五十岁以下四百三十个男全半劳力，已百分之百的组织起来，同等岁数的四百五十三个妇女全半劳力，已有百分之三十三组织起来；五十六岁以上的老人及十五岁至九岁的小孩组织起来的人数，也达到百分之三十二之多。其次，今年上半年普遍做到二工省一工、农会主席李法傅家，去年锄头遍秋地一个月还未锄完，而今年仅十三天就锄完了。今年全村四千四百九十二亩三分地（连未组织的六家在内），普遍每亩做到犁两遍，还有一部分犁到三遍。秋苗已全部锄过二遍。由于省工每亩地平均上了六十担粪，三次透雨后谷苗已长三尺多高，茭苗也长到二、三尺高了。今年上半年虽然参战出劳力六十六人，但生产却超过已往任何一年。在生产中并出现妇女刘银花及五十岁老军属张四引等十七个模范人物。在副业生产上也做出很好的成绩；计半年来纺织、运输、喂蚕、喂猪、养蜂等共收入七百三十九万余元。平均半年来每人副业收入四千五百三十元。
