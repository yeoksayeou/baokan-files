Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 24th: "One person killed, ten thousand avenge," "One family burned, everyone helps." Three million people in Nantong, Rugao East, Haimen, and Qidong in the Suzhong region, which was formerly occupied by Chiang Kai-shek, have widely launched armed revenge and mutual aid movements to counter Chiang's "scorched earth" and "blood-washing extermination." Chiang's troops in the area frequently concentrated three regiments of the 49th Division and 20,000 local Chiang puppet troops, building over a hundred strongholds, blockading the area layer by layer, and repeatedly "exterminating" for up to eight months. However, they lost 4,000 men, while the people still maintained more than two-thirds of the total area as base areas and guerrilla zones. Beginning in May, Chiang resorted to his ultimate sinister plan, carrying out an utterly inhumane "scorched earth" and "blood-washing extermination" policy in the area. In Jing'an District, Rugao East, around the Haihe Beach, over ten miles in length and breadth, three thousand civilian houses were burned to ashes in a single day. Chiang's troops in Sanyu Town and Shizongdian in Nantong tied up young men and women in rows and mowed them down with machine guns, killing more than 400 people. Gu Longda, the Chiang puppet district chief of Haimen, dug 20 burial pits in Nanyang Village, burying over 200 innocent farmers alive. According to incomplete statistics, in the past two months, over 10,000 civilian houses have been burned, and over 2,000 men and women have been killed. However, in the face of Chiang's brutality, the people are incredibly steadfast and unyielding. When Chiang's troops in Shizongdian, Nantong, drove residents into a square filled with machine guns, forcing them to "surrender," the people responded with silence. Finally, Chiang's troops dragged out a thirteen-year-old child and said with a false smile, "If you say 'surrender,' I'll let you go back to see your mother." The child shook his head and did not answer. Chiang's troops put a bayonet to his neck and shouted wildly, "I'll kill you, little bandit!" But the child said passionately to his neighbors nearby, "You tell my mother that I died at the hands of the reactionaries, and tell her to remember that." Wherever Chiang's troops burned and killed, the people tragically put forward the heroic slogans of "One family burned, everyone helps," and "One person killed, ten thousand avenge," and launched the "one liter of grain," "one handful of grass," "one bowl, one pair of chopsticks" movement to build houses for the affected people and solve their food and seed difficulties. More than 1,500 disaster victims in Jing'an District, Rugao East, which was the most severely burned, have received over 100,000 catties of grain and 30,000 catties of soybeans in relief. In Jing'an and two other districts, more than 260 young and middle-aged people joined the main force army in one week. The guerrilla team in a certain township in Haimen broke into the Chiang army stronghold in Jiangjia Town, destroying two bunkers, and wrote in their leaflets to Chiang's puppets: "If you dare to burn and kill again, we will send tens of thousands of people in to burn you to death in the bunkers and cowsheds."

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 16th: Rugao East has created "Daily Meetings" in the fight against "extermination." Cadres and the masses, and those at higher and lower levels, maintain close contact, meet every day, and persist in fighting in their original locations. When the enemy builds temporary strongholds in a certain village, in addition to a part of the township cadres forming armed work teams to conduct guerrilla activities, the rest work with the district cadres to go deep into the villages overnight, cooperate with the village cadres to convene group meetings or visit households to provide comfort, and solve difficulties for the masses. During the day, when Chiang's puppets search, they lead the masses to transfer and struggle, and analyze the enemy's situation at any time, encouraging the masses' morale. At night, the cadres gather to exchange combat experience, study the enemy's situation and countermeasures, and examine their thoughts. By meeting every day and solving problems at any time, the morale of the cadres and the masses is becoming increasingly strong.

　　反抗蒋军灭绝人性暴行
  　华中掀起复仇运动
  　被难人民互助互济坚持斗争
    【新华社华中二十四日电】“一人被杀万人复仇”，“一家被烧大家救济”，苏中蒋后南通、如（皋）东、海门、启东的三百万人民，广泛展开武装复仇与互助互济运动，以对抗蒋贼之“焦土”和“血洗清剿”。蒋贼在该地经常集中四十九师三个团及土著蒋伪共二万兵力，构筑百余据点，层层封锁，反复“清剿”达八个月，但却亏折四千人的老本，人民仍保有占全面积三分之二以上的根据地和游击区。五月开始，蒋贼竟施其最后毒计，对该地进行绝无人性的“焦土”和“血洗清剿”，将如（皋）东景安区海河滩周围纵横十余里三千间民房，一天内烧成一片焦土。南通三余镇、十总店蒋军，把青年男女一排排绑着，用机枪扫死四百余人。海门蒋记区长顾龙大在南阳村挖有廿个埋人坑，活埋无辜农民二百余。据不完全统计，两个月来，被烧民房万余间，被杀男女二千以上。但在蒋贼淫威面前，人民却无比的坚贞不屈。当蒋军在南通十总店将居民赶入密置机枪之广场逼其“投降”时，人民皆报以沉默，最后蒋军拖出一个十三岁的小孩装笑说：“你说一个‘投降’，就放你回去见妈妈”，孩子摇头不答。蒋军将刺刀架在他颈上狂叫：“杀死你这小土匪！”孩子却激昂地对在旁的邻居说：“你们带信给我妈，我死在反动派手里，叫妈妈记住”。凡被蒋军烧杀之处，人民悲壮的提出了“一家被烧大家救济”，“一人被杀，万人复仇”的英雄口号，遂掀起“一升粮”、“一把草”、“一只碗、一双筷子”运动，为难胞盖房子及解决口粮种籽等困难。被烧得最惨的如东景安区一千五百余灾民，已接到十余万斤粮和三万斤黄豆的救济。景安等三个区，一周中即有二百六十余青壮年涌入主力军。海门某乡游击队突入江家镇蒋军据点，摧毁碉堡两座，在其告蒋伪传单中写着：“再敢烧杀，我们整万人就涌进来把你们烧死在碉堡牛房里”。
    【新华社华中十六日电】如（皋）东在反“清剿”中创造“天天会”。干部和群众、上下级之间保持密切联系，天天见面，坚持原地斗争。当敌于某村构筑临时据点时，乡干部除一部组成武工队进行游击活动外，其余即与区干部连夜深入各村，配合村干部召集群众开小组会或挨户慰问，为群众解决困难。白天蒋伪搜索时，即领导群众转移和斗争，并随时分析敌情，鼓励群众斗志，入夜干部即集中交换斗争经验，研究敌情和对策及检查思想。如此天天会面，随时解决问题，因而干群之斗志日益旺盛。
