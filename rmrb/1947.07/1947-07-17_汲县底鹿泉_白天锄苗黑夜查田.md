Jixian Di Luquan
Weeding Seedlings by Day, Inspecting Fields by Night

[This newspaper reports] After the rain in Jixian, the masses in Di Luquan village, under the slogan "If we miss this rain, we'll have to go to Shanxi," mobilized to rush the sowing. First, they accurately calculated the village's manpower and animal power, implemented a village-wide large-scale labor exchange, and completed the sowing of over 700 mu of wheat stubble land in two days. They are now weeding spring seedlings. After the enemy departed for Fanglan, they organized all the men, women, and children of the village overnight to complete the work of preparing for war and hiding grain. They also continued to inspect the fields during production, discovering that eleven landlord households still had air-raid shelters. During the day, they rushed to sow and weed seedlings, and at night, they held group discussions to launch a "cut the tail" struggle against the landlords, uncovering more than 70 mu of land and houses, clothing, and other items, which were distributed at night.

    白天锄苗黑夜查田
    【本报讯】汲县落雨后，底鹿泉全村群众在“误了这场雨，还得上山西”的口号下动员起来，突击下种。首先对全村人畜力作了精确计算，实行了全村大变工，二天内完成了七百余亩麦茬地的下种，现正在锄春苗。敌人出发到芳兰后，又连夜组织了全村男女老少，完成了备战藏粮等工作。并在生产中继续查田，发现了十一户地主还存有防空洞，白天突击下种锄苗，夜里进行小组讨论，向地主展开了割尾毛斗争，查出地七十余亩及房子衣物等，黑夜进行分配。（战斗生产报）
