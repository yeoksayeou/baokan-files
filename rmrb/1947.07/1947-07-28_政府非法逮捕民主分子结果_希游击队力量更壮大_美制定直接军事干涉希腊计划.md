　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 23rd: Athens dispatch: The Central Committee of the Greek National Liberation Front has appealed to the Security Councils of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, as well as the World Federation of Trade Unions, stating: "In the past week, 15,000 citizens have been arrested and exiled throughout Greece for their democratic beliefs. They are imprisoned on barren islands without shelter or food, and hundreds of people are now on the verge of starvation. The barbarity and cruelty of the Greek authorities have now exceeded the darkest periods in human history. We protest to the entire civilized world and request your moral assistance to end the suffering of the Greek people."
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 21st: Comprehensive Report: New York Post reporter Joe Morris has reported from Athens that the Greek government's illegal arrests of political opponents have resulted in more people supporting the Greek guerrillas. Recent news from Greece confirms that, concurrent with the reactionary arrests by the Greek government, the guerrilla warfare in the north has been raging even more fiercely throughout the Grammos region. On July 13th, a unit of the Liberation Army even occupied the city of Konitza, while another unit of the Liberation Army broke through the government army's lines and marched south, attacking the city of Farsala. Fierce battles are also taking place near the city of Ioannina, south of Konitza. Due to the victorious operations of the Liberation Army, the reactionary Greek government is spreading rumors everywhere, claiming that "international brigades" have entered Greek territory. The American and British reactionaries are also making a great show of force, using this as a pretext for further adventurous intervention. Following the Greek authorities' announcement on July 15th that Britain and the United States would assist in defending Greek waters, the British Embassy in Athens announced on July 16th that the British Mediterranean Fleet would visit Greek waters from July 18th to August 12th. The US political representative in Greece is collaborating with the Greek authorities and the General Staff to formulate a plan for direct US military intervention in Greece. It is reported that, in order to avoid opposition from the American people, the plan intends to dispatch American troops to Greece in the form of a "volunteer corps" jointly formed by the US and Greek armies. According to Parisian newspapers, as a condition of US aid, the US-Greek treaty secretly stipulates that Greece will lease a portion of its territory to the US for the establishment of US naval and air bases in the Eastern Mediterranean.

  　美制定直接军事干涉希腊计划
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】雅典讯：希民族解放阵线中央委员会顷向苏、美、英、法安理会及世界职工联盟呼吁称：“过去一周中在希腊全境因民主思想被捕而流放的公民已达一万五千人，被囚禁在荒岛中无居无食，数百人民现已濒于饿毙，目前希腊当局的野蛮与残暴已超过人类历史上最黑暗时期。我们向整个文明世界抗议，并要求你们道义的援助，以终止希腊人民的苦难。”
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】综合报导：纽约邮报记者乔德莫里尔顷自雅典报道称：希腊政政实行非法逮捕政治反对派的结果，使更多的人支持希腊游击队。最近来自希腊的消息，证实与希政府的反动逮捕同时，北部游击战争更加火如荼地燃遍格拉姆斯地区。七月十三日，解放军某部并一度占领科纳柴城，另一部解放军则冲破政府军方线，向南进军，进攻方尼加城，科纳柴城以南之雅尼那城附近亦有激战。由于解放军的胜利作战，希反动政府竟到处造谣说有“国际旅”开入希境，美英反动派亦故作嚣张，以此作借口作进一步的冒险干涉。十五日希当局关于英美将协助保卫希腊海面的公报发布后，十六日雅典英大使馆即公告，英国地中海舰队将于七月十八日到八月十二日访问希腊海面。美国驻希政治代表则正协同希腊当局与参谋总部制定一种美国直接军事干涉希腊的计划。据悉为了避免美国人民的反对，该计划拟以美希军合组的“自愿兵团”形式派遣美军赴希。据巴黎报纸透露：作为美国援助的条件，美希条约中已秘密规定：希腊将以一部分领土租借予美，以便建立美国在东地中海的海空基地。
