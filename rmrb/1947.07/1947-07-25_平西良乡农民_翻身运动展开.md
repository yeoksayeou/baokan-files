Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 23rd. The peasant emancipation movement in Liangxiang, Western Hebei, a frontline area, is victoriously unfolding. In villages such as Cijiawu, which are only eight li away from enemy strongholds, land is being distributed under the active cover of local armed forces and militia. Landmines are being laid at key road junctions, and the enemy is shrinking back into their strongholds, afraid to come out. When fighting the landlord in Banbi, peasants from nearby villages such as Cijiawu and Nancheying automatically went to support them, demonstrating the spirit of unity that "all peasants are one family." In the face of this massive peasant force, feudal landlords and despots had no choice but to bow their heads in submission. The emancipated peasants in each village automatically organized militias to defend their victorious gains with arms, refusing to provide supplies to the enemy.

　　平西良乡农民
  　翻身运动展开
    【新华社晋察冀二十三日电】平西良乡接敌区农民翻身运动，正在胜利展开。距敌据点＠里不过八里之磁家务等村，在地方武装和民兵积极活动掩护下，实行分田，要路口上均埋设地雷，敌人缩在据点内不敢出来。半壁斗争地主时，附近的磁家务、南车营等村农民，自动前往支援，表现了“天下农民是一家”的团结精神，封建地主恶霸在这声势浩大的农民行列之前，不得不低头屈服。各村翻身农民，自动组织起民兵，武装保卫胜利果实，拒绝支应敌人。
