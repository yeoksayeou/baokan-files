　　Transport to Exchange for Millet
  　Store in Community Granaries to Survive Famine
    [This newspaper's report] During the rush of wheat harvesting and planting in Shexian County's First District, the Jia Xianting mutual aid group in Ci Village extracted surplus labor and six animals to organize transportation. In six days, they harvested 120 mu of wheat for their families, earning 65,000 yuan in ocean currency through transportation twice. The collective purchased ten shi of millet as a community granary to prepare for famine. Group member Hao Changsan said, "We can only overcome difficulties by helping each other. If we didn't calculate carefully, we wouldn't have been able to make this millet fortune." Under everyone's enthusiasm, the group leader led a discussion and formulated a drought resistance and famine survival plan: eat less rice and flour and more bran and vegetables, with each person saving two liang of millet per day. By not smoking cigarettes and not drinking alcohol, they can save 30,000 yuan per month, and each person gathers five jin of wild vegetables. (Feng Qingrong)
