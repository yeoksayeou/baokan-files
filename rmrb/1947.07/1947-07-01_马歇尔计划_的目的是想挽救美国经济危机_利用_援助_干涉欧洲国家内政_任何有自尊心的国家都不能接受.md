　　The "Marshall Plan" Aims to Rescue the American Economic Crisis
    Uses "Aid" to Interfere in the Internal Affairs of European Countries
  　Any Country with Self-Respect Cannot Accept
    [TASS Moscow, 25th] *Pravda's* editorial commenting on the upcoming Paris conference states: One of the most important issues after the war is the economic reconstruction of European countries that suffered from the war and German aggression. This is of great significance not only to Europe but also to the entire world. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall, in a speech at Harvard University on June 5th, reiterated the need to take urgent action to restore European countries. Marshall's speech was delivered three months after the U.S. President's so-called "Aid to Greece and Turkey Message" to Congress, which has been described by newspapers and many British and American politicians as the declaration of the "Truman Doctrine." After Marshall's speech, many foreign newspapers naturally raised the question of the relationship between the "Marshall Plan" and the "Truman Doctrine." However, Marshall's statement was too general to allow people to say now to what extent the newspaper's speculation is true. Only after the "Marshall Plan" is announced and the terms of such aid are known for sure will it be possible to give a clear answer to the relationship between the "Marshall Plan" and the "Truman Doctrine." However, there is no doubt that Mr. Marshall's plan is caused by the current economic conditions in the United States. It is now a consensus that the post-war boom in the United States is coming to an end, and the threat of economic crisis is growing. The American ruling class is trying to get rid of the difficulties of the increasingly imminent crisis by acquiring new markets and vigorously consolidating its old market positions. That is why the United States, during the post-war period, as some American economists have said, is indeed drilling for all possible markets in the world in order to gain a strong foothold in those places, and American exports have reached an unprecedented scale in American history.
    At the same time, imports are far behind exports. The huge U.S. trade surplus has become a difficult source that hinders the further development of U.S. foreign trade. Because many of America's European customers cannot pay for the increasing amount of American imports, they have limited U.S. dollars on hand and cannot obtain the necessary supplements through their exports to the United States. This is the real threat to the decline of U.S. foreign trade, and it is bound to cause a deterioration in the U.S. economic situation. Either reduce exports, or urgently implement special measures plans, first of all granting credit and loans to European countries - these are the two paths facing the American rulers. Marshall's plan apparently formulated such a program to solve the U.S. export problem, which stipulates the elimination of the growing "dollar crisis" in many European countries. In this regard, American business people are trying to weaken their looming economic crisis by eliminating or at least alleviating Europe's "dollar crisis." One cannot ignore the peculiar tendency shown by some British and American politicians and newspapers in discussing Marshall's proposal: they link Marshall's proposal with Churchill's infamous "European Federation" plan, which Bevan recently commented on with emphasized sympathy. The purpose of this tendency is nothing more than to replace the most important cause of European economic reconstruction with all kinds of adventures. These adventures are aimed at opposing the West against the East and deepening the already quite serious difficulties. The terms on which the United States intends to give them economic assistance are of decisive significance to European countries. The nature of these terms will reveal the true meaning of the "Marshall Plan," and its success or failure will also depend on those terms. If the authors of this plan use the suggestions of some overly fanatical American reactionaries to propose terms to European countries that resemble the models of Greece and Turkey, it is clearly similar to deliberately betting on the failure of this plan. This kind of "aid" will actually be an interference in the internal affairs of European countries and a sabotage of their sovereignty, which no self-respecting European country can agree to. Now, one can hear many such opinions: Properly speaking, there is no "Marshall Plan" in existence; it is just that European countries themselves should formulate their own measures for economic reconstruction and development, and then say how the United States can help them. If this is indeed the case, then the responsibility borne by the three foreign ministers' meeting in Paris on June 27th is even greater.

### “马歇尔计划”的目的是想挽救美国经济危机  利用“援助”干涉欧洲国家内政　任何有自尊心的国家都不能接受

　　“马歇尔计划”的目的是想挽救美国经济危机
    利用“援助”干涉欧洲国家内政
  　任何有自尊心的国家都不能接受
    【塔斯社莫斯科二十五日电】真理报社论评行将到来的巴黎会议称：战后最重要问题之一，是遭受战争与德国侵略的欧洲各国的经济重建问题。这不仅对于欧洲一处有巨大意义，而且对整个世界也有巨大意义。美国务卿马歇尔六月五日在哈佛大学演讲时，再次提及必须采取紧急行动恢复欧洲国家。马歇尔的演讲是在美国总统致国会的所谓“援助希土咨文”公布后三个月发表的，而该咨文已被报纸及英美许多政治家形容为“杜鲁门主义”的宣言。马歇尔演讲之后，许多外国报纸自然而然地提出了“马歇尔计划”与“杜鲁门主义”的关系问题。可是，马歇尔声明太笼统了，不能使人们现在就说出报章的揣测有何种程度的真实性。只有在“马歇尔计划”公布及此种援助的条款确知之后，才有可能对“马歇尔计划”与“杜鲁门主义”的关系作一明确的答复。不过，无庸怀疑的是：马歇尔先生的计划是美国目前经济条件所引起的。现在，美国的战后景气行将结束，而经济危机的威胁正与日俱增，实际上已是各方一致的意见。美国统治人士正试图经由获取新市场与极力巩固其旧有市场的地位，来摆脱日益迫近的危机的种种困难。这就是为什么美国在战后期间，象某些美国经济学家所说的，确在世界上钻营一切可能的市场，以便在那些地方获得强固据点，而美国的输出已达到了美国历史上空前未有的规模。
    同时，入口则远落在出口之后。美国庞大贸易出超，成了阻挠美国对外贸易更向前发展的困难的根源。因为美国的许多欧洲顾客不能偿付日益增多的美国进口货，他们手头美金有限，不能经过他们对美国的输出获得必需的补充。这就是美国对外贸易跌落的真正威胁所在，而且势必造成美国经济情况的恶化。或者减少出口，或者紧急施行特殊措施计划，首先是予欧洲国家以信用和贷款——这就是摆在美国统治者面前的两条路。马歇尔的计划显然给解决美国出口问题拟定了这样一个纲领，这纲领规定消除欧洲许多国家的日益增长的“金元危机”。在这方面，美国商界人士正试图以消除或至少是减轻欧洲的“金元危机”来削弱自己迫在眉睫的经济危机。人们不能忽视某些英美政治家与报纸在讨论马歇尔建议中所显露的奇特倾向：他们把马歇尔的建议和邱吉尔臭名昭彰的“欧洲联邦”计划联系起来，而最近贝文对该计划曾以强调的同情予以评论。此种倾向的目的无非是以各式各样的冒险来代替欧洲经济重建的最重要事业。这些冒险旨在使西方反对东方与加深目前已相当严重的困难。对欧洲国家具有决定意义的成为美国拟依之而给与他们经济援助的条款。这些条款的性质将表白“马歇尔计划”的真正意义，而其成功与失败亦将取决于该条款。此计划的作者如果利用某些过于狂热的美国反动分子的建议，而给欧洲国家提出雷同于希腊与土耳其模型的条款，这显然类似明知此计划的失败故意作一赌注。此种“援助”实际上将是干涉欧洲国家的内政与破坏它们的主权，是任何一个有自尊心的欧洲国家所不能同意的。现在，可以听到不少这样的意见：恰当地说来，并没有“马歇尔计划”存在，只是欧洲各国自己应拟定其自己经济重建与发展的措施，然后说出美国可以何种方法帮助他们。果然如此，则六月二十七日在巴黎开会，三外长会议所负担的责任就更重大了。
