Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: According to reports from the Central News Agency and the Associated Press: Hubei and Fujian provinces have also suffered from floods, while Guangdong and Guangxi provinces have experienced disastrous conditions. In Hubei Province, since the beginning of this month, the Han, Zhang, and Ju rivers have risen sharply. In Xiangyang County alone, along the Han River, more than ten townships have had their fields and houses submerged in the floodwaters. Due to the collapse of dikes on the Zhang and Ju rivers, the rivers have overflowed, and the extent of the damage is still impossible to estimate. In Fujian Province, continuous heavy rains in mid-June have caused flooding in several counties. According to official figures released by the Chiang Kai-shek government regarding the flooding in Guangdong Province, the number of people affected has been confirmed to be over 3,990,000 (approximately 12% of the province's population of over 32 million). The number of deaths due to the disaster is over 5,600. As of July 10th, 67 counties have been affected (approximately 70% of the province's 102 counties and cities), involving 432 townships. Over 11 million *mu* of paddy fields have been flooded, and over 7,000 houses have been damaged. In Guangxi Province, due to the flooding and consequent lack of food, 4,000 people have starved to death in Li County, west of Nanning, alone.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: According to a United Press report citing the Tianjin *Ta Kung Pao*: The decline in production is bringing the Chiang-occupied areas of Northeast China to the brink of a coal shortage. The *Ta Kung Pao* states: Once the existing coal reserves are exhausted, unless production is accelerated, there will be a severe coal shortage this winter. However, the Fushun Coal Mine, which recently supplied most of the needs of the Chiang-occupied areas of Northeast China, has already ceased operations due to a lack of power. It is reported that the remaining coal plants are facing economic crisis. The Fushan Coal Mine is losing 10 million "circulating currency" units per month, and at the same time, there is a severe shortage of food in the coal mining areas.
