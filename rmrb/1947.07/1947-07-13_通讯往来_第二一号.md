    Communications Contact
    No. 21
    To Comrades of Communications Teams in Various Regions:
    1. The prelude to the great counter-offensive has begun. Good news is pouring in, the entire region is jubilant, and the counter-offensive and merit-making campaign will inevitably be widely launched throughout our region. Comrades in factories, organizations, county, district, and village cadres, please immediately report on how you are intensifying production and practicing economy, your enthusiasm for supporting the counter-offensive, heroic deeds, new experiences in organizing in the new areas, and experiences in consolidating mutual aid in the old areas. When writing, pay attention to the development process of the work, grasp one issue and write clearly and in detail, do not write about everything.
    2. "August 1st" (Army Day) is approaching. Please report on the self-defense war achievements of our army over the past year, political work construction, officer-soldier relations, army-people relations, and various heroic model deeds. Show how the Party's army has grown and strengthened, how it has changed from weak to strong, from small to large, and become an invincible force in battle. Please also seize the opportunity to report on the situation of preferential treatment for military personnel in the rear, model deeds of military families and honorably discharged soldiers; and promptly reflect on the organization and preparation of the "August 1st" Movement Week and other activities.
    3. In the future, our liberated areas will expand day by day. Please seize the new spirit of boldly and freely mobilizing the masses in the new areas, discover typical examples, and write news reports and send them in.
          The Newspaper's Communications Liaison Department
