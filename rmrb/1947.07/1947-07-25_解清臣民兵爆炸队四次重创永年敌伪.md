　　Jie Qingchen's Militia Explosives Team Inflicts Four Heavy Blows on Enemy and Puppet Forces in Yongnian

　　[Our newspaper's telegram from Jinan, 21st] The militia flying explosives team besieging the iron bandit (Iron Millstone Xu Tieying) in Yongnian is displaying great power and has been awarded commendations. Comrade Jie Qingchen, Military Industry Section Chief of the Jinan Military Commission, led the militia flying explosives team to launch a siege and explosion campaign against the iron bandits inside Yongnian city. In less than a month, from May 17th to June 13th, they bombed the enemy four times. The first three times, 28 landmines were detonated, wounding 17 enemies and killing 24. The last time, on the night of June 13th, the enemy broke into our minefield, and 53 landmines detonated, scattering blood and flesh everywhere. The enemy suffered over 50 casualties, including a battalion commander and lower ranks. Since then, the enemy has been terrified and dared not leave the city for a long time. The team has received a commendation order from the Jinan Military Commission.

　　[Our newspaper's report] Yongnian news: Since the bandit Hu Ruzi's troops were disarmed by our people's army at the Cuijiaqiao stronghold in Anyang, the traitor Hu temporarily escaped to Yongnian city on the night of the 25th day of the third month of the lunar calendar. However, just after arriving in the city, the puppet bandits immediately had conflicts over power within two days and nights. On the 27th, the traitor Wang Zemin plotted a banquet to invite the traitor Hu for drinks. Thus, the two traitors, Wang and Hu, engaged in a dog-eat-dog fight, and the traitor Hu was shot dead by Wang Zemin at twelve o'clock that morning. At that time, Xu Tieying (Iron Millstone) cried for two or three days, and the contradictions became even greater. Currently, the enemy and puppet forces are unable to maintain their livelihood, eating only six taels of mixed grains with water plants every day to survive, and are all hungry, yellow-faced and thin, worrying all day about having no way to go to heaven and no door to enter the earth. Our army is launching a political offensive, and the number of enemies who surrender with their guns, abandon their weapons on the battlefield, and repent are increasing day by day.

　　解清臣民兵爆炸队四次重创永年敌伪
    【本报冀南二十一日电】围困永年铁匪（铁磨头许铁英）的民兵飞行爆炸队大显神威，荣获嘉奖。冀南武委会军工科长解清臣同志，带领民兵飞行爆炸队，对永年城内之铁匪展开了围困爆炸战，仅从五月十七日至六月十三日不满一个月时间，就炸敌四次，前三次响雷二十八个，炸伤敌十七名，炸死二十四名；最后一次，在六月十三日夜，敌闯进我地雷阵中，响雷五十三个，遍地血肉模糊，敌伤亡中队长以下共约五十余人。自此敌惊慌万状，长时不敢出城，该队已获冀南武委会传令嘉奖。
    【本报讯】永年消息：自土匪胡儒子部在安阳崔家桥据点被我人民军队解除后，胡逆一时侥幸，于旧历三月二十五日连夜逃窜永年城。然而刚到该城，两昼夜时间，伪匪为了争权，就立即起了矛盾。二十七日王逆泽民设计摆宴请胡逆吃酒，于是王胡二逆就实行了狗咬狗，即当天上午十二点胡逆被王泽民枪毙了。当时许铁英（铁磨头）就哭了两三天，从此矛盾更大。目前该敌伪生活更无法维持，每天只食六两杂粮，配以水草维持生活，都饿的饥黄面瘦，终日愁着上天无路入地无门。我军正展开政治攻势，敌携枪投降、临阵缴枪、回心自首者，正日益增多。
