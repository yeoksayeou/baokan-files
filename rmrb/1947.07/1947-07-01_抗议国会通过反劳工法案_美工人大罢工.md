　　Protesting Congressional Passage of Anti-Labor Bill
  　US Workers Stage Massive Strike
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th] Washington Dispatch: American labor and progressive figures are continuing to fight against the anti-labor bill passed by the US Congress (this bill is the notorious Taft-Hartley Act, which focuses on restricting workers' right to strike, abolishing the right of unions to collective bargaining, and abolishing the requirement for workers to join a union upon entering a factory). In addition to the previously reported two large demonstrations by American workers in Madison Square, New York, the White House revealed on the 21st that it had received 800,000 letters and telegrams demanding that Truman veto the bill by the 1st of this month. Under strong pressure from the masses, Truman vetoed the bill on the 20th. On the same day, the House of Representatives overturned Truman's veto by a vote of 331 to 83. In the Senate, senators led by progressive Senator Pepper, who opposed the bill, implemented delaying tactics to break the Republican Party's attempt to make a hasty decision, launching a "relay" race of speeches unprecedented in the United States in the past 20 years, one after another, taking the stage to deliver lengthy speeches, the longest of which lasted ten hours in one breath. Their purpose was to allow the will of the American people to have a chance to express itself before the Senate vote. However, because the reactionaries occupied the advantage, the Senate postponed until the 23rd and overturned Truman's veto by a vote of 68 to 25, making the bill finally become law.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 27th] New York Dispatch: American labor has begun to launch a large-scale strike movement to protest the enactment of the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law. At the same time, the unity of labor-progressive forces has promoted the third-party movement. It is reported that as of the 24th, 135,000 coal miners in the United States had refused to work, and another 40,000 dockworkers were scheduled to strike from the 26th to protest the "slave labor law" passed by the US Congress. According to labor figures here, union leaders will not admit defeat in opposing the Republican anti-labor law and will question the legality of the bill in the Supreme Court to try to repeal it. On the other hand, former Vice President Wallace, who had previously announced that he was considering organizing a third party, commented on the matter, saying that Truman's failure to persuade Congress not to enact the bill was the most tragic of several failures to implement President Roosevelt's plan. Wallace also said: Du failed to obtain the support of 20 Democrats in the Senate to support his veto, which implies that Truman's leadership has become a problem. Some people believe that the enactment of the new bill will undoubtedly give new impetus to the birth of a third party in politics. Truman's veto of the bill was merely "crocodile tears," putting on a show to ease popular dissatisfaction with the government authorities. Even the New York Times pointed out that Truman's proposal of this plan was a political strategy to speculate on next year's election and to delay the division within the Democratic Party and prevent the emergence of a third party.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th] New York Dispatch: The strike by American workers against the anti-labor bill has affected the steel industry. The production of Carnegie Illinois Steel Corporation has dropped to 25 percent, and Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation has completely shut down. 2,000 factory workers belonging to the Congress of Industrial Organizations went on strike on the 23rd, and 1,000 US coal mines are now shut down due to strikes, with estimated production losses of more than one million tons per day. In the face of this mass strike, Truman abandoned his hypocrisy of vetoing the anti-labor bill a few days ago and declared on the 26th that he was willing to see the bill "faithfully and effectively implemented," and threatened the American workers' protest strike to defend basic labor rights, saying: "Once the labor unrest spreads, it will threaten the stability of our country (the United States)'s economy." "We can never tolerate such consequences!" But the New York Post revealed that Du's statement was strong on the outside but weak on the inside. The newspaper reported that after the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act, government officials in Washington expressed considerable concern and unease. Most government and trade union officials firmly believe that after the miners' strike, there will be a series of strikes in major industries.

### 抗议国会通过反劳工法案　美工人大罢工

　　抗议国会通过反劳工法案
  　美工人大罢工
    【新华社陕北二十六日电】华府讯：美国劳工及进步人士反对美国会所通过的反劳工法案（该法案即臭名四溢的塔虎脱、哈特莱法案，其中心是限制工人罢工权利，取消工会集体议价权及取消工人进厂须参加工会之规定。）之斗争，仍在继续发展中。除前已报导的美国工人在纽约麦迪逊广场的两次大示威外，据白宫方面二十一日透露，白宫收到要求杜鲁门否决该项法案之函电，迄本月一日止已达八十万件之多。在群众强大压力之下，杜鲁门遂于二十日否决了该法案。同日，众院又以三三一票对八十三票否决了杜鲁门的否决。在参院以进步议员泼贝尔为首的反对该法案的参议员们，为了打破共和党匆匆作出决定之企图，实行拖延战术，展开了美国二十年来所仅见的演说“接力”赛，一个接着一个，登台发表冗长之演说，最长有一口气讲了十小时者。他们的目的是想使美国人民意志在参院表决之前，能有表达之机会。但因反动派占居优势，参院延至二十三日竟以六十八票对二十五票推翻杜鲁门的否决，使该法案终于成为法律。
    【新华社陕北二十七日电】纽约讯：美国劳工为了抗议塔虑脱、哈特莱反劳工法之制定，已开始发动大规模罢工运动，同时由于劳工——进步阵线行动之一致，已促进了第三党的运动。据悉，至二十四日止，美国已有煤矿工人十三万五千拒绝工作，另有码头工人四万人亦定自二十六日起罢工，抗议美国会所通过的“奴役劳工法”。据此间劳工界人士表示，工会领袖将不承认反对共和党反劳工法之失败，并将就该法案之是否合法向最高法院提出质疑，以争取撤消该法案。另一方面，前已宣布考虑组织第三党之前副总统华莱十顷就此事发表评论称，杜鲁门之未能说服国会勿制定该法案，乃未能执行故罗斯福总统计划若干次失败中之最可悲者。华氏并称：杜氏竟未能在参院中取得民主党二十人之赞成，以支持他的否决，实暗示杜鲁门之领导已成问题。若干人士认为新法案的制定，在政治上无疑将予第三党之诞生以新的刺激。按杜鲁门之否决该法案，仅是“猫哭老鼠”，装装样子，以缓和人民对政府当局之不满。即纽约时报也指出杜鲁门之提出此一方案，乃系一种政治策略，用以对明年大选投机，并延缓民主党内部之分裂而防止第三党之产生。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】纽约讯：美国工人反反劳工法案之罢工，已影响到钢铁工业。卡芮捷伊利络斯钢业公司生产已降至百分之廿五，琼斯及洛夫林钢铁公司则已完全停工。产业工会联合会所属之工厂工人二千人已于廿三日罢工，美国一千家煤矿现因罢工而停工，产量损失估计日在百万吨以上。在此群众性罢工面前，杜鲁门已抛弃其数天前否决反劳工法案时之假惺惺，而于廿六日宣称愿见该法案“忠实而有效之执行”，并对美国劳工为保卫劳工基本权利之抗议罢工加以威吓谓：“一旦工潮蔓延，势将威胁我国（美国）经济之稳定。”“吾人决不能忍受此种后果！”但杜氏声明之外强中干性质已为纽约邮报所泄露。该报载称，在塔虎脱、哈特莱法通过以后，华府政府人士颇表忧虑与不安，大部分政府和职工会人士坚信，在矿工罢工之后，必将产生主要工业中一连串的罢工。
