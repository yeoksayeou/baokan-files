    Yushe Second District District and Village Cadres Examine Leadership
    Strengthen Learning and Transform Work Style
    [This Newspaper, Yushe News] The district and village cadres of the Second District commemorated "July 1st" by launching a movement to study Chairman Mao's democratic work style, summarizing and examining their ideological leadership, democratic work style, and mass line in the half-year of production. The following shortcomings, which urgently need correction, were discovered during the examination: First, some district and village cadres believed that they had worked hard to help the masses turn over last year, so they should rest, relaxing production leadership; others believed that production could be done without relying on poor and hired peasants, failing to recognize that this was the second revolution, relaxing the leadership of the peasant association. When assigning tasks, they were afraid of trouble, using all-inclusive meetings (with landlords and rich peasants also participating) to replace everything, causing the peasant association to lose its function, creating cliques of thought among cadres and peasants, and blurring class boundaries. For example, some cadres even praised landlord ×× as a model on the blackboard newspaper. Second, district cadres went to the countryside and sat in the village office waiting for work, relying on meetings to discover problems, with many meetings, many assignments, and little inspection. For example, Yang Yinlong said: "I am a 'peddler.' When the higher-ups assign tasks, I simply move them down to the village cadres, regardless of whether they remember them or not, thinking that this is how the work is done." Liu Yinyuan said: "When I go to the countryside, I don't even have time to pee. I have to attend several meetings every day, and they last until midnight. The work cannot be pushed away." Third, the work is not thorough, only assigning tasks without inspection, relying on meeting reports. Those who are good at speaking are considered good cadres, while those who are practical but not good at speaking are considered bad cadres. They only know which group or team is good, but when asked how good they are, or how the typical person is active, they stare blankly and don't know. Based on the above self-criticism, everyone unanimously agreed that they must transform themselves properly, and thus a movement to study Chairman Mao's work style was launched. The leadership made self-criticisms, and everyone recognized that production is the second revolution, and last year's turning over relied on the poor peasants and hired laborers. After the victory of the struggle, this year's production still cannot do without the poor peasants and hired laborers as the backbone. All villages have successively rectified the peasant associations and purged some bad landlords. After this, production picked up. Some landlords and rich peasants, seeing the peasants engaged in production, had no choice but to engage in production themselves. It was also proposed that fewer all-inclusive meetings should be held in the future, that meetings should be prepared and focused, with less assignment and more inspection, delving into groups and teams to discover problems, understand thoughts, and provide specific help and guidance. Yang Yinlong said: "I wanted to learn Chairman Mao's work style before, but I didn't know what Chairman Mao's work style was. Now I know that this is Chairman Mao's work style. In the future, I must improve myself, learn Chairman Mao's democratic work style, and continue to make contributions for the people." (Chen Zhimin)

    榆社二区区村干部检查领导
    加强学习改造作风
    【本报榆社讯】二区区村干部纪念“七一”，开展学习毛主席的民主作风运动，总结检查了自己半年生产中的思想领导，民主作风，群众路线。检查中发现以下几个急需改正的缺点：一、区村干部在今年生产中认为去年领导群众翻身出了力，可该休息休息啦，放松了生产领导；还有的人认为生产不依靠贫雇也行，没有认识这是第二个革命，放松了农会领导，布置下工作来怕麻烦，一揽子会（地主富农也参加）代替了一切，农会失掉作用，干部农民产生了一伙伙思想，阶级界限不明确，如有的干部竟在黑板报上表扬地主××是模范。二、区干部下乡坐在村公所等工作，靠开会发现问题，开会多，布置多，检查少。如杨银龙说：“我是个‘小贩’，上级布置下工作来，我照样给村干部搬下去，不管记住记不住，认为这就把工作做了。”刘银元说：“我下了乡连尿尿的空也没有，每天平均开好几个会，一开就是半夜，工作也推不开。”三、工作不深入，只布置不检查，靠开会汇报，会说的认为是好干部，实干的不会说的认为这干部不好，只知道那一组、队好，再问怎样好，典型人如何活动，就瞪了眼不知道。根据以上检讨，大家一致认为可得好好的改造自己，于是掀起了学习毛主席的作风运动，领导上做了检讨，大家都认识到生产是第二个革命，去年翻身依靠贫农，斗争胜利了，今年生产，还是少不了贫雇做骨干，各村先后都整顿了农会，把一些坏蛋地主清洗了。经过这样，生产起了劲，一些地主富农看到农民生产，自己也不得不生产。并提出今后少开一揽子会，开会有准备、有中心，少布置多检查，深入组队发现问题，了解思想，具体帮助指导。杨银龙说：“我在前就想学毛主席作风，不知甚是毛主席的作风，现在才知道这就是毛主席的作风，以后可得健全自己，学习毛主席的民主作风，继续为民立功。”（陈志敏）
