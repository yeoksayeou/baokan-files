[Reported by this newspaper from Pingshun] The Seventh District convened a meeting of district cadres on the 17th of this month. During discussions, it was discovered that cadres and the masses had several ideological problems regarding the three weedings and the top-dressing of all corn: First, the masses have never had this habit. In previous years, they only weeded twice. They feel that there is no grass, so a third weeding is useless. Second, it's okay to weed millet three times, but corn has already been hilled up after two weedings. To weed a third time, the soil has to be dug up, and they are afraid of breaking the adzuki bean seedlings. Third, they feel it is difficult to do all top-dressing because of fertilizer shortages, and they make excuses that top-dressing is useless. "The corn has already sprouted tassels, so it's too late to top-dress." After discovering these problems, based on the experience of the masses, it was proposed: "Hoe the soil in the dog days, it's as good as plowing in the fall." "One weeding during the first ten days of dog days is equivalent to three jin of oil per mu. One weeding during the second ten days of dog days is equivalent to two jin of oil per mu." "Adzuki beans are not afraid of breaking the seedlings; support each seedling, and each seedling will produce more grain." Everyone unanimously decided to mobilize the masses to solve the fertilizer shortage with the following methods: sweep the streets, empty latrines, collect manure from pens, use manure from the bottom of the pen, sweep chicken manure, use oily sludge, oilcake fertilizer, and use soil from cooking stoves and walls with mustard greens, etc., to supplement. Regarding the issue of three weedings for corn and millet, the solution discussed was to contract out the weeding work to landlords based on the amount of land, how easy or difficult it is to weed, and the amount of weeds. Each village will cultivate a core group to take the lead in promoting the work. Based on the above methods, the district cadres, based on the specific situation of each village, formulated a plan for three weedings and top-dressing for the entire district. According to the labor situation in the entire district, each laborer will weed an average of one mu of land per day, combined with top-dressing. From the second to the nineteenth day of the sixth lunar month, the entire district will complete three weedings of corn and millet within seven days. The second weeding has already been completed, and a few lagging behind are being rushed. Villages such as Anyang, Dashihe, and Shimenkou have already started the third weeding. District cadres have gone to the countryside, and everyone is very confident. (Zhao Xi)

[Reported by this newspaper from Taiyue on the 26th] Under the leadership of the two heroes, Gao Yunting, and the chairman of the farmers' association, Gao Yuting, Yuan Village in Tunliu has largely completed weeding and is now rushing to accumulate fertilizer on wheat fields. According to statistics from July 12th, three-quarters of the corn had been weeded twice, more than half of the millet had been weeded three times, more than half of the beans had been weeded twice, and the cotton had all been weeded four times, de-leaved, and pruned. The autumn seedlings are growing vigorously. The corn is over one person tall, and the millet and beans have covered the knees. Throughout the weeding process, semi-laborers played a significant role. The Qugui children's group of seven, in addition to weeding their own one hundred plus mu of autumn land, also weeded six workdays for others, helped war-dependent families weed three mu of beans, and cut one and a half mu of wheat. They are now concentrating livestock power to help each other plow the wheat fields, planning to plow all the wheat fields for the first time within ten days. This year, the wheat fields will be plowed twice. One-quarter of the eight hundred mu of wheat has already been plowed, and the large-scale fertilizer accumulation campaign has also begun. The method is to cut artemisia to pad the pens and compost manure, aiming to apply at least twenty dan of manure per mu. They also plan to plant more high-yielding and vigorous white-eared wheat and red-eared wheat, and to trial-plant Xiaomai No. 169.

[Reported by this newspaper] Yushe Xishan summarized the summer harvest and grain collection. All men and women, young and old, mobilized together to compete, starting early and working late to complete the grain collection and wheat cutting within thirteen days. They completed the plan two days early, saving a total of eighty-four workdays. The old man Fei Fu, a war-dependent family member, said, "I used to think that mutual aid teams were useless. My son joined the army and I lacked labor, but now everything is done early. Mutual aid teams are really useful." Zhang Erhuo said, "If we don't organize, I'm afraid it would take another half a month to complete. Truly, three people with one mind can turn yellow soil into gold. More people make work easier, and mutual aid can save labor." On the evening of the 11th of this month, after heated discussions, a plan for plowing wheat fields and weeding seedlings was formulated, totaling one hundred and ninety mu and eight fen of wheat fields, to be completely plowed by eighteen cattle within ten days. The entire village has two hundred and sixty-six mu of miscellaneous fields and two hundred and ninety-six mu of rice fields, to be weeded three times within fifteen days, ensuring that the hoes are hung up before the Beginning of Autumn. Each group works by ravine and ridge, calculates labor locally, pushes work tickets at any time, determines wages on time, and allocates work uniformly. The movement is currently underway.

　　平顺等地订出当前方针
  　玉茭全部追肥保证秋苗三锄
    【本报平顺讯】七区于本月十七日召开区干部会议，讨论中发现干部群众对上三锄及玉茭全部上追肥存在的几个思想问题；一、群众一贯的就没有这种习惯，前几年只是锄二遍就算，只是有少数谷锄三遍，感到没有草，上三锄也不顶事。二、谷有些上三锄还可以，玉茭已经二锄上了堆，要锄三遍还得扒凸，又怕碰断红豆秧。三、对全部上追肥感到困难，因肥料困难，又借口说上追肥也不顶事。“玉茭已长出脑英来了，上追肥也赶不上了。”发现这些问题后就依据群众的经验提出：“伏天锄破皮，顶住秋后犁一犁。”“头伏拉一锄，每亩顶上三斤油。二伏拉一锄，每亩顶上二斤油。”“红豆不怕碰断秧，支支秧，支出支秧还多产粮。”大家一致决议发动群众用以下办法解决肥料困难：扫街掏茅坑，出圈肥，下圈底，扫鸡肥、上柏油、油饼肥，上芥菜打炕土墙土等肥来补助。对玉茭、谷上三锄的问题，讨论出的办法是要根据地亩数多少好做不好做草多少，和地主共同包出分数来锄。各村培养一个核心组起带头推动作用。根据以上的办法，区干部根据各村的具体情况，订出全区的锄三遍苗及上追肥的计划，按全区劳力情况每个劳力每天平均拉一亩地，结合上追肥。自阴历六月初二日到十九日七天内，全区玉茭谷可完成上三锄。现已经二锄完成，有少数的丢下尾巴正在突击中。如安阳、大石河、石门口等村已开始上三锄。区干部已分头下乡，大家信心很高。（召喜）
    【本报太岳二十六日电】屯留原村在双英雄高云亭和农会主席高玉亭等领导下，锄苗大部完成，现正突击垡麦地大积肥。据七月十二日的统计，玉茭四分之三锄了二遍，谷大半锄过三遍，豆大半锄过两遍，棉花都锄了四遍，脱了裤打了杈与油条。秋苗都很旺盛，玉茭有一人多高，谷、豆都埋住膝盖。在整个锄苗过程中，半劳动力大大起了作用，儿童鞠桂组七个人，除锄自己一百多亩秋地外，还给别人锄了六个工，帮抗属锄了三亩豆，割了一亩半麦。现正集中畜力互助犁麦地，计划在十天内把全部麦地犁完头次，今年麦地普犁两遍。现八百亩麦已犁了四分之一，大积肥运动亦已开始，办法是割蒿多垫圈沤粪，要做到每亩至少上粪二十担，还计划要多种收成重而有劲的白穗麦和红穗麦，并试种一六九小麦。
    【本报讯】榆社西山总结夏收挽谷。全村男女老少一齐出动起早搭黑竞赛，十三天内完成挽谷割麦。提早两天完成计划，共计省工八十四个，抗属斐福有老汉说：“我从前认为互助组不顶事，我儿参军劳力缺，现在啥也早做完，互助组真顶事。”张二货说：“咱要不组织起来，怕再用半个月也完成不了。真是三人并一心，黄土变成金，人多好做活，互助能省工。”本月十一日晚，经过热烈讨论订出了耕麦地锄苗计划，共麦地一百九十亩零八分，十八头牛十日内全部垡完。全村共有杂田二百六十六亩，谷田二百九十六亩，在十五天内完成三锄，立秋前保证挂起锄钩。各组按沟按岭做活，当地折工，随时推工票，按时定工资，统一拨工。现运动正在开展中。（榆社锄苗防旱报）
