Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 7th: TASS, Sydney dispatch: MacArthur's permission for Japan to mine phosphate on Angaur Island in the Palau Islands has been met with fierce opposition from Australia. The Australian government has lodged a second protest against this decision, which was made without consulting other Allied nations controlling Japan. The Australian representative to the Far Eastern Commission has been instructed to solemnly point out the various unilateral actions taken by the United States. (Note: Angaur Island is one of the most strategically significant islands in the southwestern Pacific, approximately 300 miles from New Guinea.) Australia also strongly opposes the recent move by the US authorities to allow Japan to conduct whaling in Antarctica for the second time. According to the Sydney "Sun," "Australia will lodge the strongest protest with the US Ambassador in Washington against the US's permission for Japan to whale in Antarctica again, opposing MacArthur's decision. The Australian Foreign Minister will also make the same frank statement to MacArthur during his upcoming visit to Tokyo."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 3rd: The recent announcement by the US State Department and War Department to restore Japan's private international trade has aroused dissatisfaction among the British. According to London sources, British Far East expert, Gelin, commented in the Sunday Observer that the main reasons for British merchants' dissatisfaction are: (1) The expenses of foreign business delegations to Japan must be calculated in US dollars. (2) The priority provisions are unfavorable to the British banking community. (3) The number of British manufacturer representatives is relatively small in the total. (4) Some indications suggest that the British designated business areas in Japan are not prosperous from a commercial point of view.

　　麦克阿瑟袒护日本
  　澳国再度提出抗议
    【新华社陕北七日电】塔斯社悉尼讯：麦克阿瑟允许日本在帛琉群岛的安瓜尔岛开采磷酸盐矿，已遭到澳国方面之猛烈反对。此一未与其他管制日本的盟国磋商的决定，澳政府已第二次提出抗议。远东委员会澳国代表已获训令，郑重指出美国所作各种单独行动之事项。（按：安瓜尔岛系西南太平洋最有战略意义岛屿之一，距新几内亚约三百哩。）澳方并极力反对最近美当局允许日本第二次赴南极捕鲸之举。据悉尼“太阳报”称：“澳国对美国允准日本再次至南极捕鲸一事，将由澳国驻美大使在华盛顿提出最强硬的抗议，以反对麦克阿瑟此一决定。澳外长亦将在其不久访问东京时向麦克阿瑟作同样坦率的声明。”
    【新华社陕北三日电】美国务院及陆军部日前宣布恢复日本私人国际贸易一事，已引起英国人士之不满。据伦敦消息，英远东问题专家葛琳于星期观察家报撰文评称：英商不满之主要理由为：（一）赴日外国商务代表团之费用必需以美元计算。（二）优先规定对英银行界不利。（三）英国厂商代表之数额在总额中比数较少。（四）若干暗示指陈英国在日被指定之商务区域，自商业观察点视之有欠繁荣。
