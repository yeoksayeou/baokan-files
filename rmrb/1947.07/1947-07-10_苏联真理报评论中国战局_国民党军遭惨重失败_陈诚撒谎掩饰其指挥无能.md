Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 7th: TASS Moscow, June 6th: Pravda commentator Viktorov commented on the Chinese war situation, stating: After the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a civil war in China, they expected a swift victory and the complete defeat of the People's Army. The Kuomintang, equipped with American military supplies, launched a "general offensive against the Communists." However, the Kuomintang army overestimated its own strength and underestimated the fact that the People's Army, although not receiving outside assistance and lacking American weapons (only obtaining American weapons when fighting the Kuomintang army), relied on the strong support of the broad masses with whom they were closely connected. The result of the offensive proved disastrous for the Kuomintang. They concealed their failures, issuing deliberately fabricated reports for a long time. However, the failures of the Kuomintang army have reached such a scale that they can no longer be concealed. Chen Cheng, Chief of Staff of the Kuomintang army, was forced to admit in his military report that "the situation of the Northeast National Army is extremely critical." However, the problem is not just admitting defeat, but how they explain the defeat. Of course, the bankrupt Chief of Staff dared not tell the truth, so he adopted the tricks favored by the Kuomintang reactionaries, piling up fabrications and slanders, and arbitrarily said: "Korean Communist troops who have received secret training from the Soviet side are fighting side by side with the Communist army," and "at least thirty-one Soviet advisors" are attacking Sipingjie with the People's Army. Obviously, Chen Cheng used this pathetic lie with the intention of not only defending his heavy defeat and bankruptcy but also obtaining continuous assistance from abroad for the Kuomintang army. Chen Cheng will not gain military honor with his malicious lies; these lies will only earn Chen Cheng the title of a foolish slanderer.

　　苏联真理报评论中国战局
  　国民党军遭惨重失败
    陈诚撒谎掩饰其指挥无能
    【新华社陕北七日电】据塔斯社莫斯科六日电，真理报评论员维克托罗夫评论中国战局称：国民党反动派在中国发动内战后，他们曾预计到他们迅速的胜利与人民军队之完全失败，国民党以美国军火装备其军队，而发动“对共产党之总攻势”。然而，国民党军人过高地估计自身的力量，而轻视了这种情况：人民军队虽得不到自外面之援助，没有美国武器，而只在与国民党军队作战时始得到美国武器；但是他们却依靠着他们与之密切联系的广大群众的有力支持。攻势之结果，证明了对国民党是很悲惨的，他们隐瞒他们的失败，长期间地发表着故意捏造的报导。然而，国民党军队失败已经到了这样的规模，使他们不能再隐瞒了。国民党军队参谋总长陈诚在其军事报告中，被迫承认“东北国军之形势至为危急”。然而，问题不仅仅是承认失败，而是在于他们的如何说明失败。当然，破产的参谋总长不敢说出实情的，他便采用了国民党反动派所乐用之诡计，堆积了一堆捏造与诬蔑而武断说：“曾受苏方秘密训练之韩共军，与共军正并肩作战”，及“最少有三十一个苏联顾问”正与人民军队攻击四平街。显然的，陈诚利用这种可怜的撒谎，其意图不但要为其惨重失败及其破产辩护，而且也要使国民党军队从国外取得不断之援助。陈诚将不能以其恶意的谎言而获得军事之荣誉，这些谎言将使陈诚仅仅博得一个愚蠢诽谤家的称呼。
