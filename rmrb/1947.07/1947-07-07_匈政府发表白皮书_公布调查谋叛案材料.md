Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 2nd.—Budapest: The Hungarian Government's Propaganda Department has recently published a 153-page white paper disclosing important materials from the investigation of the treason case, including the confessions of various traitors during their trials. Nagy's personal secretary, Hepus, confessed that the main purpose of the treasonous leaders such as Nagy was to drag the country to the right with the support of the United States and Britain. Hepus also listed the names of representatives sent by the Nagy faction to the United States, Britain, and France to contact the reactionaries in those countries. The materials in the white paper also confirm that Vargas, the former Speaker of the National Assembly who participated in the treason, fled to the American-occupied zone of Austria after obtaining a passport from the US Ambassador to Hungary.
