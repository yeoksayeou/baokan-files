Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, July 19th: A unit of General Liu Bocheng's main force, in 50 hours from the 12th to the 14th, annihilated 19,000 invading KMT troops from two divisions between Juye and Jinxiang, and recovered Jiaxiang. The KMT troops annihilated were the entire 32nd Division, the entire 70th Division (minus one regiment), totaling two division headquarters, three full brigades, and one full regiment. According to preliminary statistics: over 3,000 KMT troops were killed or wounded, and over 15,000 people were captured, including the 70th Division Commander Chen Yiding, Deputy Division Commander Luo Zhedong, and the Chief of Staff of the 141st Brigade of the 32nd Division. The amount of confiscated goods is currently being inventoried. From June 30th, when General Liu Bocheng's army crossed south, to the 14th, within 15 days, six full brigades and one regiment of the KMT army, as well as security regiments and "homecoming corps," totaling 38,300 people, have been annihilated. Six county towns have been recovered. The aforementioned 70th Division that was annihilated was originally He Jian's old unit, and was transferred from Taiwan in December last year to join the civil war. The 32nd Division was originally Shang Zhen's old unit, and has long been the main force of the KMT army harassing northern Henan.
	Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, July 19th: The following is an account of the annihilation of the KMT's 32nd Division and 70th Division by General Liu Bocheng's troops in the area between Juye and Jinxiang: When the People's Liberation Army crossed the south bank of the Yellow River and encircled and annihilated the 55th Division of the KMT army entrenched in Yuncheng, the KMT bandits hurriedly transferred their 32nd Division, 66th Division, and the newly organized 3rd Division from northern Henan, rushing to their aid. Their 32nd and 66th Divisions, together with the 70th Division originally entrenched between Jinxiang and Jiaxiang, used Jinxiang as a stronghold, forming an eastern pincer, advancing towards the area south of our Juye, and urgently adjusted the entire 58th Division from south of the Longhai Railway to Jinxiang City, shielding its command post in Jinxiang City. Another 153rd Brigade of the 63rd Division was transferred from eastern Henan to Dingtao, forming a western pincer with the remnants of Liu Ruzhen's 68th Division entrenched south of Heze, attempting to block our southward righteous army, pincer attack our southward crossing army, and protect its Xu-Zhou base and the security of the Longhai Railway. Our army, while encircling and annihilating the 55th Division of Yuncheng, quickly advanced with a main force to the Cao County and Dingtao area. On July 6th, Cao County was recovered, and on the 10th, the 153rd Brigade of the 63rd Division entrenched in Dingtao was annihilated in one fell swoop, destroying its western pincer. At this time, our main force, with the speed of lightning, captured the enemy's main eastern pincer force in the southeast of Juye. The KMT army was caught off guard, and the entire 70th Division (minus one regiment) and the entire 32nd Division were surrounded by us in the Liuyingji and Dushanj areas in the southeast of Juye. Our army launched the battle on the evening of the 12th, and by the 14th, the entire 32nd Division and 70th Division (minus one regiment) were annihilated on the line of Liuyingji and Dushanj, and Jiaxiang City was recovered by us. Two brigades of the KMT's 66th Division are still surrounded by us in Yangshanji, north of Jinxiang. At this point, of the eight divisions hastily assembled by the KMT army (five divisions) and the three divisions originally entrenched in southwestern Shandong, three divisions and one brigade have been annihilated, and one division has been besieged. Now, leading the 58th Division and the 199th Brigade of the 66th Division, they are trapped in the isolated city of Jinxiang, at a loss, and can only hold on and wait for reinforcements.

　　南渡反攻大军续克嘉祥
  　歼灭蒋军两个整师
  　活捉敌师长以下万五千
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线十九日电】刘伯承将军主力一部，于十二日至十四日五十小时内，在钜野、金乡间痛歼进犯蒋军两个师一万九千人，并收复嘉祥。被歼蒋军为三十二师全部，七十师全部（缺一个团）共两个师部，三个整旅，又一个整团。据初步统计：毙伤蒋军三千余，俘虏七十师师长陈颐鼎，副师长罗哲东，三十二师一四一旅参谋长以下一万五千余人。缴获正清查中。自六月三十日刘伯承将军大军南渡迄十四日止十五天时间内，已歼灭蒋军六个整旅又一个整团及保安团、“还乡团”等共计三万八千三百余人。收复县城六座。按上述被歼之七十师原为何键旧部，去年十二月始由台湾调来加入内战。三十二师原为商旧部，久为蒋军进扰豫北之主力。
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线十九日电】刘伯承将军所部在钜野、金乡间歼灭进犯蒋军整三十二师、整七十师等两个师的经过如下：当解放军渡过黄河南岸，围歼盘踞郓城蒋军五十五师之际，蒋贼仓惶从豫北赶调其三十二师、整六六师及新组织之第三师，兼程驰援。其整三十二师、整六六师与原盘踞金乡、嘉祥间之整七十师联合以金乡为据点，形成东面钳子，向我钜野以南地区进犯，并从陇海以南急调整五八师全部进至金乡城，屏障其在金乡城之指挥所。另从豫东调来六十三师之一五三旅，赶赴定陶与盘踞菏泽以南地区之刘汝珍整六十八师残部形成西面钳子，企图阻我南下义师，钳击我南渡大军，保障其徐州内战根据地与陇海路的安全。我军乃于围歼郓城五十五师之同时，以主力一部迅速挺进至曹县、定陶地区。七月六日收复曹县，十日一举歼灭盘踞定陶之六三师一五三旅，摧毁其西钳。此时我主力大军，随即以迅雷不及掩耳之势，向钜野东南地区捕捉敌之主力东钳部队，蒋军措手不及整七十师（缺一个团）、整三十二师全部，乃被我包围于钜野东南之六营集、独山集地区。我军于十二日晚发起战斗，至十四日即将整三十二师与七十师（缺一个团）全部歼灭于六营集、独山集之线，嘉祥城当为我收复。蒋军六十六师两个旅，则仍被我包围于金乡北之羊山集。至此，蒋军仓惶调集之五个师及原盘踞鲁西南地区之三个师共八个师，已有三个师及一个旅被歼，一个师被围。现率五十八师及六十六师之一九九旅困处金乡孤城，一筹莫展，只能死守待援而已。
