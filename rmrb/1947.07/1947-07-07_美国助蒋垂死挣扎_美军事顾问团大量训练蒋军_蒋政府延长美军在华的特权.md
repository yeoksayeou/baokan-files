　　U.S. Aids Chiang in a Desperate Struggle
    U.S. Military Advisory Group Trains Chiang's Troops Extensively
  　Chiang Government Extends Privileges of U.S. Troops in China
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th — U.S. imperialism, through its military advisory group in China, is extensively training Chiang's army officers and technical personnel with new tactics, expanding the civil war to slaughter the Chinese people. According to a speech by Rooks, head of the U.S. military advisory group, published in the Shanghai Zhengyan Daily on the 11th of last month: the group's mission is to train Chiang's troops with modern tactics. The infantry, artillery, and mechanized forces schools established by the group in Nanjing and Suzhou have already graduated 120 officers. In addition, schools for training air force instructors and technical personnel have been established in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Xuzhou, Hankou and other places. According to a Shanghai News report on June 5th: Rooks personally attended the graduation ceremony of the Xuzhou instructor class and the opening ceremony of the student class on June 2nd. Chiang's army officers and technical personnel who have graduated from U.S. training are now serving on the front lines of the civil war.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th — According to a United Press report from Nanjing: The Chiang Kai-shek Legislative Yuan passed a bill on the 3rd to extend the privileges currently enjoyed by U.S. military personnel until the day the U.S. military completely "withdraws" from China. These privileges include criminal offenses being tried by U.S. military courts. This "bill" shows that Chiang Kai-shek is continuing to allow U.S. troops to rape, pillage, and kill the Chinese people in exchange for the U.S. reactionaries' aid in the civil war. It also reveals the deceptive trick of the so-called U.S. military "withdrawal." As is well known, the U.S. side announced not long ago that U.S. troops stationed in China would be basically "withdrawn" by July 1.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th — According to a TASS report from Shanghai on the 1st, citing the "Ta Kung Pao": U.S. Marines committed atrocities in Qingdao again. On June 29th, three Chinese people were shot and killed by U.S. Marines.

　　美国助蒋垂死挣扎
    美军事顾问团大量训练蒋军
  　蒋政府延长美军在华的特权
    【新华社陕北五日电】美国帝国主义正通过其驻华军事顾问团，以新型战术大量训练蒋军军官及技术人员，扩大屠杀中国人民的内战。据上海正言报上月十一日发表美军顾问团团长鲁克斯谈话称：该团任务以现代战术训练蒋军。该团在南京、苏州建立的步炮与机械化部队学校，已有一百二十名军官毕业。此外在上海、杭州、徐州、汉口等地，均设有训练空军教官与技术人员的学校。另据上海新闻报六月五日讯：六月二日徐州教官班毕业暨学员班开学会上，鲁克斯均亲往参加。美国训练毕业之蒋军军官与技术人员，现正服务于内战前线。
    【新华社陕北五日电】据合众社南京讯：蒋记立法院于三日通过法案，延长美军人员目前享有的特权至美军完全“撤出”中国之日为止。该特权包括刑事罪由美军法庭审判。此一“法案”，显示蒋介石正继续放手让美军在华奸淫杀戮中国人民来换取美国反动派的援助内战。并又透露了所谓美军“撤退”的欺骗勾当。如所周知，不久以前美方曾宣布七月一日以前驻华美军将基本上“撤退”完毕。
    【新华社陕北四日电】据塔斯社上海一日电引“大公报”消息称：美海军陆战队又在青岛行凶，六月二十九日，有三名中国人为美陆战队所枪杀。
