    Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 15th. When a unit of the East China People's Liberation Army cleared the strongholds on the periphery of Fei County on the morning of the 3rd of this month, it compressed a battalion of miscellaneous Chiang Kai-shek troops entrenched in Difangzhen, twenty-five li northwest [of Fei County], into a small temple. They then launched a political offensive. The Chiang Kai-shek troops, unwilling to make unnecessary sacrifices, were led by Battalion Commander Xiang Yanjun, who ordered all the officers and soldiers of the entire battalion, more than 500 men, to lay down their arms automatically.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 14th.
