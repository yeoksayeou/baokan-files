　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 28th: Cai Chang, representative of the Preparatory Committee of the Women's Federation of the Chinese Liberated Areas, who went to Prague, Czechoslovakia, in February this year to attend the first council meeting of the International Women's Democratic Federation, has recently returned here. The Harbin Women's Federation is preparing a grand welcoming ceremony. It is reported that Ms. Cai had received invitations from the International Women's Federation twice, but was unable to attend due to unreasonable obstruction by the Chiang Kai-shek side, which refused to issue her a passport. This time, in response to the third invitation from the International Women's Federation, she finally managed to attend after overcoming numerous difficulties. Ms. Cai reported to the conference on the general situation of the women's movement in the Chinese Liberated Areas and the heroic deeds of Chinese women in the Anti-Japanese War and the current patriotic self-defense war. She also appealed to the conference to support the just struggle of the Chinese people against American imperialist aggression and Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous, dictatorial, and civil war policies, which won the warm sympathy of the delegates present.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: Cai Chang, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Women's Federation of the Chinese Liberated Areas, has issued a written report to the women of the liberated areas on the first Council Meeting of the International Women's Democratic Federation. The original text is as follows:

　　In order to unite women from all countries to fight together for the cause of peace and democracy, the Women's Federation of the Liberated Areas joined the International Women's Democratic Federation in 1945 and was elected as a member of the Council and the Executive Committee. Since then, I have been invited twice to attend the Executive Committee meetings on June 10th last year, but I was unable to attend due to all kinds of obstruction from the Chiang government, which refused to issue me a passport. This year, I was invited again to attend the first Council Meeting, and after overcoming many difficulties, I finally arrived in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, to participate in the meeting and establish good relations with women representatives from various countries. Now, I will report the process of participating in this Council Meeting to the sisters in the liberated areas across the country.

　　(1) Meeting Content: The International Women's Federation, with 80 million members from 44 countries, held its first Council Meeting in Prague, Czechoslovakia. The meeting opened on February 21st and closed on February 27th. More than 100 Council members and representatives from 30 countries, including China, the Soviet Union, the United States, France, Spain, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Outer Mongolia, North Korea, and Democratic Vietnam, attended the meeting. The Council listened to the summary report by Chairman Eugénie Cotton on the activities carried out by the International Women's Federation after the founding conference, listened to the important speech by Vice-Chairman Popova, and the reports of various executive committee members, council members, and the Secretary-General on various issues. After that, it discussed and adopted seven motions and the Council's appeal to women worldwide. In order to strengthen the work of the Standing Committee, the Council added four specialized committees according to its needs and elected the chairpersons of each committee as follows: Child Protection Committee (USA: Ms. Genber), Committee on the Social, Economic, and Legal Status of Women (Czechoslovakia: Golakova), Information Committee (Poland: Plaglova), Committee on the Status of Women in Colonies and Dependent Countries (Algeria: Sportis).

　　(2) The Spirit of the Meeting: When this Council Meeting was held, although the German, Italian, and Japanese fascists had been defeated for more than a year, international reactionary forces and the remaining fascist forces were growing under the protection of their protectorates—the American and British imperialist blocs—and were doing everything they could to undermine the unity of the United Nations, engaging in anti-democratic and anti-people activities, and attempting to launch a new world war. In particular, American imperialism has recently considered supporting the revival of German and Japanese fascism as "correcting mistakes." It can be seen that American imperialism is inseparable from the remaining fascists worldwide, and it is no accident that American imperialism is supporting Chiang Kai-shek's civil war in an attempt to strangle China's democratic forces. The democratic women of various countries and China have already paid a great price in the war against German, Italian, and Japanese fascism, sacrificing their husbands, sons, and happy families. After the victory, they certainly do not want the recurrence of wars of aggression. Therefore, the Council reflected the will of all democratic women, calling for a struggle against the remaining fascist forces attempting to provoke new wars. The Council also believed that peace and democracy are inseparable. In order to consolidate peace, democracy must first be guaranteed in each country. Therefore, it called on members of all countries to unite all democratic forces, consolidate democratic positions, and oppose the attacks of all reactionary forces. Only by eliminating the remaining fascist forces in the world, truly consolidating peace and democracy, can the social, economic, and legal conditions of women and children be truly improved. This is the basic spirit of the conference. Based on this spirit, the Council expressed its support for the Soviet Union's democratic foreign policy aimed at strengthening the unity of the United Nations and protecting the rights and interests of small countries; approved and praised some activities carried out by members of various countries in their respective countries and internationally in this spirit; expressed satisfaction with the fact that women in our liberated areas can enjoy all democratic rights and strive for peace and democracy; and expressed indignation at the lack of democratic freedom for the people in the Chiang-controlled areas.

　　(3) Hopes for Sisters in the Liberated Areas: Our Women's Federation in the Liberated Areas has 20 million members, accounting for a quarter of the total membership of the International Women's Federation; and our position is at the forefront of the war to defend the independence and peaceful democracy of our motherland, which is also participating in the great event of defending world peace and democracy; therefore, our responsibility is very heavy. At present, sisters in various liberated areas, whether on the front lines, in the rear, in the countryside, in factories, or in schools, have made many achievements in the self-defense war. However, we must work harder, unite more women, exert more strength, work hard to consolidate the rear, support the front lines, resolutely, thoroughly, and completely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's invading army that has been transfused with blood by American imperialism, and defend the democratic rights and the victory of land reform that have been obtained. Only in this way can we realize China's independence, peace, and democracy, and only then can we be considered to have contributed to the cause of world peace and democracy, which is also giving the most resounding response to the call of the International Women's Federation Council.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 28th: Comrade Cai Chang, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Women's Federation of the Liberated Areas, returned from attending the first Council Meeting of the International Women's Democratic Federation in Prague, Czechoslovakia, and brought with her the appeal of the Council, which reads as follows: "On the occasion of the March 8th International Women's Day, the Council of the International Women's Federation extends its warmest greetings to all democratic and anti-fascist women around the world! It expresses its condolences to the mothers, wives, and sisters of those warriors who bravely sacrificed themselves for democracy and peace, and expresses its utmost sympathy and gratitude to all women who, on the front lines, in the rear, in the fields, in factories, and in laboratories, are contributing everything to the victory of the cause of peace and democracy together with all the people! The Council of the International Women's Federation pays its respects to women all over the world who continue to fight against fascism and reactionary forces, and especially to the heroic women of China, Spain, and Greece! The Council of the International Women's Federation firmly believes that peace can only be guaranteed by developing and consolidating the democracy that the people of all countries have already won. The Council of the International Women's Federation calls on women all over the world, regardless of race or color, to unite as one, to fight against the remaining fascist forces around the world, and to fight against those reactionaries who only care about their own privileges and disregard the welfare of the people, who are doing their best to provoke relations within the United Nations, and who are trying to incite new conflicts! The Council of the International Women's Federation believes in the future and deeply believes in the will of the people of all countries—especially women—to fight strongly for freedom, progress, and the guarantee of peace, and in their great strength that has defeated and will continue to defeat the reactionaries. The Council of the International Women's Federation calls on all anti-fascist democratic women in all countries to unite and join the Federation. Long live the union of women striving for democracy and peace! Long live the International Women's Democratic Federation! Long live the March 8th International Women's Day!"

　　参加国际妇联理事会归来
  　蔡畅同志发表书面报告
  　号召全解放区妇女更加努力团结保卫民主权利与土地改革的胜利
    【新华社东北二十八日电】今年二月赴捷京布拉格参加国际妇女民主联合会第一次理事会之中国解放区妇联筹委会代表蔡畅等，已于日前返抵此间，哈市妇联会正筹备盛大欢迎会。按蔡氏曾两次接到国际妇联会邀请，均由蒋方无理阻挠不发出国护照而未能实现。此次应国际妇联第三次邀请，终经重重困难得往出席。蔡氏曾向大会报告中国解放区妇运概况和中国妇女在抗日战争及当前爱国自卫战争中的英勇事迹，并向大会呼吁声援中国人民反抗美国帝国主义侵略和蒋介石卖国独裁内战的正义斗争，博得到会代表之热烈同情。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】中国解放区妇联筹委会主任蔡畅顷对全国解放区妇女发表关于国际民主联合会第一次理事会的书面报告，原文如下：
    解放区妇联会为了团结世界各国妇女共同为和平民主事业而奋斗，于一九四五年参加了国际妇女民主联合会，且被选为理事与执委以来，曾于去年六月十日两次被邀参加执委会会议，皆因蒋政府之百般阻挠，不发给出国护照，致未能成行。今年，我又被邀出席第一次理事会，经过重重困难，终于达到捷克首都布拉格，参加了会议，并与各国妇女代表建立了良好关系。现将参加此次理事会的经过报告给全国解放区的姊妹们。
    （一）会议内容：拥有四十四个国家八千万会员的国际妇联此次在捷京布拉格召开第一次理事会，会议于二月二十一日开幕，二十七日闭幕。出席者有：中、苏、美、法、西、捷、波、外蒙古、北朝鲜、民主越南等三十国理事及代表共百余人。理事会听取了主席戈登夫人关于国际妇联在成立大会之后所进行的活动的总结报告，听了副主席波波娃夫人的重要发言及各执委理事和秘书长关于各种问题的报告之后，讨论并通过了七项议案及理事会对全世界妇女的号召。为了加强常委会工作，理事会按其需要添设了四个专门委员会，并选出各委员会主席如下：保护儿童委员会（美国：根别尔女士），妇女社会经济与法权地位委员会（捷克：戈拉可娃），情报委员会（波兰：普拉格洛娃），殖民地和附属国妇女状况委员会（阿尔吉尔：斯波尔提司）。
    （二）会议的精神：此次理事会开会时，德意日法西斯虽已被击败了一年多，而国际反动势力及法西斯残余势力，则正在它们的保护国——美英等帝国主义集团的卵翼下滋长，而且正以全力破坏联合国的团结，进行反民主反人民的勾当，并企图发动新的世界大战。尤其是美国帝国主义，最近竟认为扶植德日法西斯复活乃“纠正错误”。可见美国帝国主义与全世界法西斯残余已分不开，可见美帝国主义援蒋内战，企图绞杀中国的民主势力也决非偶然。世界各国和中国的民主妇女们，在反对德意日法西斯的战争中，已经付出了绝大的代价，牺牲了丈夫、儿子和幸福的家庭。胜利之后，当然不愿意侵略战争的重演。因此理事会反映了全体民主妇女的意志，号召为反对企图挑起新战争的法西斯残余势力而斗争。理事会又认为和平与民主不可分，为了巩固和平，首先必须在各国内使民主获得保证。因此号召各国会员团结一切民主力量，巩固民主阵地，来反对一切反动势力的进攻。只有消灭了世界法西斯残余势力，真正巩固了和平与民主，妇女与儿童在社会上、经济上、法律上的情况才能得到真正的改善。这就是大会的基本精神。根据这种精神，理事会对于苏联目的在于加强联合国团结，保卫小国权益的民主性外交政策，表示拥护；对各国会员本着这种精神在各国内和国际进行的一些活动给予批准和赞扬；对于我解放区妇女能享有一切民主权利，并努力为和平民主而奋斗的精神表示满意，对蒋管区人民没有民主自由表示愤慨。
    （三）对解放区姊妹的希望：我解放区妇联二千万会员，占国际妇联会员总数四分之一；而我们的岗位又处在保卫祖国的独立与和平民主的战争的前哨，也就是正参与保卫世界和平与民主的伟大事件；所以我们的责任十分重大。目前各解放区的姊妹，不论在前线、在后方、在农村、在工厂、在学校，对自卫战争都已作出了很多成绩。然而还必须更加努力，团结更多的妇女，发扬更多的力量，努力巩固后方，支援前线，坚决彻底干净全部消灭有美国帝国主义输血的蒋介石进犯军，保卫已获得的民主权利与土地改革的胜利，才能实现中国的独立、和平与民主，也才能算对世界的和平民主事业有了贡献，也就是给了国际妇联理事会的号召以最响亮的答复。
    【新华社东北二十八日电】解放区妇联筹委会主任蔡畅同志出席捷京国际妇女民主联合会第一次理事会归来，携来该理事会之号召书文如下：“欣逢三八国际妇女节，国际妇联理事会特向全世界民主妇女和反法西斯妇女们致以最热烈的敬礼！对那些为民主与和平而英勇牺牲的战士们的母亲、妻子、姊妹致哀问，对一切在前线、在后方、在田间、在工厂、在实验室和全体人民一起为赢得和平民主事业胜利而贡献自己一切的妇女们表示莫大的同情和感激！国际妇联理事会向全世界各地继续为反法西斯和反动势力而斗争的妇女致敬礼，特别要向英勇的中国、西班牙和希腊妇女们致敬！国际妇联理事会深信只有发展和巩固各国人民所已经争得的民主才能保证和平。国际妇联理事会号召全世界妇女不分种族与肤色，一致联合起来，向全世界的法西斯残余作斗争，向那些只顾个人特权不顾人民福利，竭力挑拨联合国关系，并企图煽动新冲突的反动派作斗争！国际妇联理事会相信将来的前途，并深信各国人民——特别是妇女——为自由进步和保证和平而坚强斗争的意志，及其曾经战胜而且将来还要战胜反动派的伟大力量。国际妇联理事会号召各国一切反法西斯的民主妇女联合起来加入妇联。争取民主与和平的妇女联合万岁！国际妇女民主联合会万岁！三八国际妇女节万岁！”
