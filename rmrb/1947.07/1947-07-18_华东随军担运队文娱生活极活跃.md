Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 16th. The stretcher transportation teams serving the East China Field Army have extremely active cultural and recreational lives. Each battalion has a club, each company has a cultural instructor, and transportation team members can learn five or six hundred characters in two months. The Jiaodong counties' stretcher regiments also publish mimeographed newspapers such as "People's Strength News," written by the team members themselves. Merit quick reports and blackboard newspapers are even more common. In addition, each transportation company has a copy of the troop newspaper and the local newspaper. Theater troupe work is also very active in the transportation teams. The theatrical troupe of the Junan Carrying Team has written 20 scripts for the transportation team, including "Sending My Husband to Join the Stretcher Bearers," "Returning Home After Making Great Contributions," "Rescuing on the Front Lines," and "Distressed Homecoming Maiden." They have written nearly 30 songs, such as "Brave Stretcher Bearers" and "Annihilate the 74th Division," which have been performed over 200 times. Amateur theater troupes have been universally established in the Jiaodong transportation teams, and the stretcher team troupes in the Yimeng Mountains area of ​​central Shandong also perform frequently. The carrying team's life is very regular. For example, the carrying teams of the Bohai Lijin and other counties, which followed a certain unit, had three classes and two lectures every day. They got up at four o'clock in the morning to practice mountain climbing, and conducted formation exercises in the evening. They also carried out sanitation campaigns, took hygiene classes, and carried out major cleanups wherever they went, stipulating regular bathing and changing clothes. Every stretcher bearer has been vaccinated for the third time. Therefore, all the military stretcher bearers can maintain good health, high morale, and extraordinary courage.

    【新华社山东十六日电】服务于华东野战军的担架运输队，文化娱乐生活极为活跃。每大队设有一俱乐部，每中队设有一文化教员，运输队员有在两个月中识到五六百字的。胶东各县担架团并出版有“民力报”等油印小报，作者都是队员自己。而立功快报、黑版报更普遍。此外，每个担运中队均有一份部队报和本地报。剧团工作，在运输队中也很活跃。莒（县）南担运队的文工团为运输队编写的剧本，已有“送郎参加担架兵”、“立下大功再回家”、“火线抢救”、“还乡闺女遭殃”等二十种。编写的歌曲有“勇敢担架兵”、“歼灭七四师”等近三十首，已轮回演出二百余次。胶东的担运队普遍建立了业余剧团，鲁中沂蒙地区各县担架队剧团亦经常演出。担运队生活很有规律，如跟随某部的渤海利津等县担运队，每天三课两讲，早上四点钟起床，练习爬山，晚上进行队形练习。并开展卫生运动，上卫生课，每到一地，都要进行大扫除，规定经常洗澡、换衣。每个担架队员都已打过第三次防疫针了。因此，所有随军担运队员，都能保持健康愉快、奋勇异常。
