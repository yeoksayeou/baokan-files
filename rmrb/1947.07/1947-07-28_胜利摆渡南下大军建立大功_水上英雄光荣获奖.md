　　[Report from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area on the 27th] During this time when our great army was bravely crossing the natural barrier of the Yellow River, the sailors heroically ferried under a hail of bullets. The 4th Military Subdistrict Headquarters commended 50 water heroes. On July 13th, the Subdistrict Headquarters convened a victory meeting for the river crossing and elected heroes. Thirty-one sailors, including Nie Yanjin and Feng Guanwu, who spearheaded the advance with seven small boats, were selected as special-class heroes. Wang Delin, Li Anhe, and nineteen others were selected as first and second-class heroes. Commissioner Li personally presented flowers and wine to the 50 heroes and said: "You are all meritorious servants of the people. I represent the masses of the eleven counties to pay tribute to you." He then awarded four large banners inscribed with "Ferrying Champions" and "Water Heroes" to the various headquarters and the small boats that first reached the shore. All 50 heroes received medals, certificates, towels, etc. Hero representative Comrade Nie Yanjin delivered a reply, calling on everyone to "more humbly examine themselves, promote their strengths, fill their shortcomings, and make greater contributions to defeating Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible." Finally, all the sailors shouted, "Forever follow the Communist Party!" and the meeting adjourned amidst joyful applause.
　　[Report from our newspaper in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area on the 27th] After receiving the task of ferrying the army on June 30th, 300 sailors were mobilized in a tense manner. After the leadership explained the glorious and important nature of the task, everyone forgot their fear and competed to make contributions for the people. When the sailors were called upon to volunteer that evening, thirty-one heroes, including Wu Xinjing and Nie Yanjin, stepped forward to sign up and piloted seven small boats to spearhead the advance. Before setting off, they entrusted their belongings to others, and some even entrusted a portion of the money they had saved for many days to their confidants, indicating their willingness to sacrifice. The seven small boats sailed quickly towards the enemy. When the enemy discovered them, under intense fire from both sides, only the second boat had reached the shore, while the other boats were still thirty-five steps away from the shore due to being blocked by sandbars. Heroes such as Wu Xinjing and Huang Zhaofa jumped into the river to lead the way, carrying guns back and forth more than ten times. The elderly Mr. Luo Chuanxi, who was in his fifties or sixties, carried flowers on his arm and silently carried supplies back and forth. Some boats made fifteen or sixteen trips without changing shifts. Sailors Li Anhe and Wang Delin saw soldiers and livestock falling into the river and immediately jumped into the river with their clothes on to rescue them. Fan Dengjia personally carried sick soldiers onto and off the boats. The seventy-two-year-old boatman Ma Jinan, with a wrinkled face and white hair, ferried back and forth in the wind and rain. Others tried to persuade him to rest several times, but he refused and even competed to carry ammunition, directing the soldiers to board and disembark, and encouraging everyone: "Every trip we make is equivalent to eliminating thousands more enemies and obtaining several cannons." In one night, these heroes ferried the great army across the river. Deputy Commissioner Li said: "This is equivalent to winning a great victory!" Representatives of the crossing troops sent pigs, wine, and over 200,000 yuan to慰劳 (comfort and reward) them.
