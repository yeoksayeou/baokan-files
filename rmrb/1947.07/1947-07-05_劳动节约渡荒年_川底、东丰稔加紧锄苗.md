[Our Newspaper Pingshun News] Chuandi Village in the First District, after organizing production, the whole village's life is no longer about eating chaff. This year, the seedlings in the fields have all been secured. Therefore, after the proposal of preventing drought and preparing for famine, the masses have both reliance and fear in their minds. The general masses say: "The seedlings in the fields are not considered dry. It won't be too late if it rains in another ten days." Households without grain rely on public relief and borrowing from mutual aid groups. For example, Guo Xihai's family of three harvested more than ten dan of grain last year, and by March this year, they had nothing to eat, borrowing from the cadres' charity granary every day. Li Bangcheng said: "I have nothing to eat. Each household in the mutual aid group should lend me three dou, which would be more than three shi." Households with grain are afraid that they will not be able to eat well with the surplus grain left over. Because of this kind of resistance, the movement could not be carried out. The leadership raised questions among the masses such as "Can we survive the famine by relying on heaven, relief, or others? Will it be good or bad to eat the remaining grain during the famine?" In terms of methods, they guided the masses to recall the famines of 1942 and 1943. After deliberation and discussion, the masses realized that neither reliance nor fear would work. Guo Jianting said: "In 1943, the crops grew as tall as people, but they still didn't yield anything because of the drought. Now the seedlings are indeed just grass, and relying on them will lead to failure." Labor hero Guo Yu'en proposed: "Save ourselves by conserving labor. Let's just say we have dozens of shi of charity granary, but who will be able to eat them in turns during the famine?" Then, the slogan "Reliance and fear are both losses, save ourselves by conserving labor and production" was put forward. After breaking through ideological barriers, they organized a sudden rush to weed the seedlings. Seven out of the nine mutual aid groups in the village collectively contracted to weed the seedlings, weeding 500 mu in nine days. Labor hero Guo Yu'en immediately led his group to take the lead in picking 2,000 jin of vegetables. The whole village picked 5,000 jin of vegetables in two days. Under the influence of his group, each household formulated a production and conservation plan, eating chaff and grain in half-and-half proportions, saving three he of grain per person per day, cultivating one mu of wasteland to grow vegetables, planting more late-season crops, and preparing 30 jin of wild vegetables and 15 jin of chaff per person, which is enough to survive the famine.

[Our Newspaper Xiyang News] Dongfengren in the Third District convened a meeting of production team leaders on the evening of the 21st of last month. Each team reported on the situation and inspected the weeding movement. Weeding of miscellaneous fields has been done once universally, and the second weeding and sorghum harvesting has begun. In order to complete the weeding early, accurate calculations were made to clarify the division of labor. Male full laborers weed the seedlings, with each person weeding an average of one and a half mu per day. Seventy-five full laborers can complete the second universal weeding in nine days. Semi-laborers, auxiliary laborers, and female laborers are all organized to carry out a sorghum harvesting blitz. A total of half a month will be needed to universally weed the miscellaneous fields twice and harvest the sorghum. Finally, labor hero Zhang Shuaicheng put forward the slogan "This weeding shows skill, establish merit again after the weeding is over" to encourage everyone's enthusiasm to be a model. Now, each team is enthusiastically challenging and competing, launching a second blitz of weeding and sorghum harvesting. (Dongfengren Communication Team)

　　劳动节约渡荒年
  　川底、东丰稔加紧锄苗
    【本报平顺讯】一区川底村经过组织起来生产，全村生活都已不吃糠，今年地里小苗又全部捉住，因此在防旱备荒提出后，群众存在依靠、害怕两种思想，一般群众说：“地里小苗不算旱，再迟十天下了雨也不迟。”没粮食吃的户依靠公家救济与互助组里借，如郭喜孩三口人去年收粮十余石，到今年三月间就没吃的，每天找干部借义仓，如李邦成说：“我没吃的，互助组里每户给我借上三斗就是三石多。”有粮食户又怕余下粮食自己吃不好。因这种思想抵抗，运动不能开展，领导上即在群众中提出“靠天靠救济，靠别人，是否能渡过灾荒？有粮食节余下灾荒时吃好吃不好”等问题。在方式上，引导群众回想四二、三年灾荒，经过酝酿讨论，群众认识了依靠、害怕都不成，如郭见廷说：“四三年庄稼长的人来高还要旱的不收，现在小苗确还是棵草，依靠就会落空。”劳动英雄郭玉恩提出：“自己劳动节约救自己，就说咱有几十石义仓，灾荒了可轮着谁吃？”接着提出口号：“依靠害怕都吃亏，节约生产救自己。”经打通思想后，组织突击锄苗，全村九个互助组就有七个组互助集体包工锄苗，九天锄苗五百余亩。劳动英雄郭玉恩即领导全组先动手采菜二千斤，全村两天采菜五千斤，在他组的影响下各户都订出生产节约计划，糠菜粮食对半吃，每天一人能节省三合粮食，每户开荒种菜一亩，多种晚田，每人准备野菜三十斤，糠十五斤，再加上纺织，满能渡过灾荒。（常三毛）
    【本报昔阳讯】三区东丰稔上月廿一日晚召开了生产小组长会议，各组汇报情况，检查锄苗运动。杂田已普遍锄一次，开始二次锄苗与挽谷，为了早完成锄苗，精确计算明确分工，男全劳力锄苗，每人每天平均锄一亩半，七十五个全劳力有九天能完成二次的普锄，半劳力辅助劳力及妇女劳力，全部组织起来进行突击挽谷。前后共计半个月可将杂田普锄二次，谷挽完。最后劳英张甩成提出“这一次锄苗显技能，锄苗结束再立功”的口号，来鼓舞大家当模范的热情。现在各组队正热火朝天的挑战竞赛，突击第二次锄苗及挽谷。（东丰稔通讯小组）
