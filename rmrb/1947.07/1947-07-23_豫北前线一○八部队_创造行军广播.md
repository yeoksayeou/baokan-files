Yubei Frontline Unit 108
　　Creates Marching Broadcasts

[This Newspaper News] Comrades Liu Zhi, Wang Minzhao, and others from the Yubei Frontline "108" unit reported: The frontline "108" unit, during continuous marching, created a "living newspaper" for propaganda and mobilization work—the marching broadcast. For example, during the march: "Pass it forward, the instructor has picked up a machine gun!" "Pass it back, the second platoon leader has also picked up a machine gun!" "Pass it forward, the instructor and the second platoon leader are challenging each other!" "Pass it back, the second platoon leader has accepted the challenge!" "Pass it back, the bugler has picked up a small cannon!" This encouraged everyone's unity and mutual assistance, immediately praising the exemplary role of each individual, ensuring that no one fell behind and completing the marching task. This kind of living newspaper (marching broadcast) has three major characteristics: (1) The broadest mass participation: interviewing, editing, and reading the news are all done through the mass line, not by a few people. When the masses see someone's merits, that is interviewing the material; when there is material, how to spread the ideas is the masses' editing; speaking it out is publishing it; spreading it is the combination of distribution and reading. (2) Timeliness: it spreads throughout the long line in half a minute, and this kind of reporting is continuous and full of mobilization power. (3) More people are praised: on-the-spot, public, and direct praise has a greater positive effect. This marching broadcast can not only be used for praise and mobilization but also for quickly conveying victory news and conducting concise and essential political education. It can be used not only during marches but also during battles. For example, in the battle to capture Bo'ai, Comrade Cao Jiafeng, the instructor of the third battalion, quickly conveyed the news that the first battalion had captured a field gun to each company, igniting the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses, and quickly launched the third charge and captured another field gun.
    Units 205, 208, 203, 104, and others publish another type of "living newspaper," sending people ahead to write the exemplary models, good news, and entertainment materials with red powder, blue indigo, and white lime on the prominent walls on both sides of the road, and writing them on pieces of paper and sticking them on the walls. "109" writes them as slips of paper to be passed around and read. In addition to achieving the effect of propaganda and mobilization, it can also help soldiers with their cultural learning.

　　豫北前线一○八部队
  　创造行军广播
    【本报讯】豫北前线刘志、王敏昭等同志报导：前线“一○八”部队在连续行军中，宣传鼓动工作上创造了“活报纸”——行军广播。如在行进中，“往前传，指导员扛上机枪啦”！“往后传，二排长也扛上机枪啦”！“往前传，指导员和二排长挑战啦”！“往后传，二排长应战啦”！“往后传，号兵扛上小炮啦”！这样鼓动着大家的团结互助，即时表扬每个人的模范作用，保证不掉队完成行军任务。这种活报纸（行军广播）有三大特点：（一）最广泛的群众性，采访、编辑、读报，都是通过群众路线大家来干的，不是少数人干的。群众看到某人的优点，就是采访了材料；有了材料，思想怎样传出去，就是群众的编辑；说出口，就是出版啦；传开去，就是发行与读报的结合。（二）及时半分钟内，在长长的行列中就都传遍了，而且这种报导是连续的富于鼓动性的。（三）被表扬的人多，当场当众直接的表扬，积极作用更大。这种行军广播不但可以进行表扬与鼓动，而且可以迅速的传达胜利消息及进行中心扼要的政治教育。不但用于行军中，而且可用于战斗中。如攻克博爱战斗中，三营教导员曹家风同志将一营已夺获一门野炮的消息迅速传达各连，将群众的热情与积极性燃烧起来，很快的举行第三次冲锋也夺下另一门野炮。
    二○五、二○八、二○三、一○四等部队出版另一种“活报纸”，预先派人先走，将表扬的模范、好消息及文娱材料用红粉、蓝靛、白灰等写在大路两旁显著的墙壁上，及用纸片写好贴在墙上，“一○九”则是写成纸条子传看，随传随读。除了收到宣传鼓动之效外，还可以帮助战士的文化学习。
