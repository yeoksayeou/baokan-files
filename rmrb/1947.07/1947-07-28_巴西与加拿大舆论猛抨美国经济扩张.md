　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Reports from various sources: Public opinion in Brazil and Canada is strongly criticizing American economic expansion into those two countries. The Brazilian newspaper "Democracia" pointed out that Brazilian newspapers are full of American goods advertisements and stated: Within five or ten years, we will only eat and wear American goods, as if we have neither industry nor trade of our own. It further pointed out: "Our country will become a slave state, forced to accept everything (referring to the dumping of American goods - editor), whether it needs it or not. Such Americanization is ultimately intolerable. The Brazilian newspaper "Tribuna da Imprensa" stated: "No Brazilian patriot can allow the interests of American monopolistic capital to surpass our national sovereignty and independence." Canadian Conservative Party Member of Parliament, Flett, recently denounced the flood of American goods in Parliament and criticized the government's trade policy, stating: "The trade deficit with the United States for the first four months of this year has reached 300.3 million yuan, and will reach 900 million yuan by the end of the year."

　　巴西与加拿大舆论猛抨美国经济扩张
    【新华社陕北廿三日电】各方讯：巴西加拿大两国舆论极力抨击美国对该两国的经济扩张。巴西“民主报”在指出巴西报纸上充满美货广告后称：在五年或十年以内，我们将只吃穿美国的物品，好象我们自己既无工业又无贸易一样。并指出：“我们国家将成为奴隶国家，不管它需要与否都必需接受一切（指美货倾销——编者），这样的美国化，终是不可忍受的。巴西“大家论坛报”称：“没有一个巴西爱国者能容许美国独占资本的利益超越于我国主权与独立之上。”加拿大保守党议员佛莱答，日前在议会中斥责美货之泛滥，并抨击政府的贸易政策称：“本年四个月对美贸易的逆差已达三亿零三百万元，迄年底将达九亿元。”
