　　The situation in southwestern Shanxi improves
  　Hu Zongnan's lackeys have their legs broken
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jinan Front, 3rd] Our special correspondent Mu Xin reports on the situation in southwestern Shanxi: General Chen Geng's ever-victorious corps swept through southern Shanxi in April, liberating 19 county towns and all the Yellow River crossings. In late May, they pounced on western Shanxi. In less than ten days, they captured six cities including Xiangning, Fencheng, Xiangling, Hongdong, Puxian, and Daning, turning Hu Zongnan's painstaking efforts of one year and 25 cities gained at the cost of more than three brigades into nothing. Most of the fertile fields hundreds of miles down the Fen River were liberated. Of the 700-li stretch from Lingshi Nanguan to Fenglingdu on the southern Tongpu Railway, less than one-tenth is currently held by the stubborn Yan Xishan. The overall situation in Shanxi has changed. The People's Liberation Army controls more than three-quarters of the province's 105 county towns. Hu Zongnan's lackey stretching into Shanxi has had its leg broken, exposing the right flank of the stubborn Hu troops in northern Shaanxi, and seriously threatening his rear base. Hu's battle line is showing signs of disintegration. The 30th Division and the 206th Division, each with four regiments, are trapped on the isolated islands of Linfen, Yuncheng, and four other locations, lacking food and ammunition, relying solely on airlifts for supplies. Lu Chongyi (commander of the 30th Division), trapped in this inescapable net, is requesting reinforcements day and night. The rumor mill of the Central News Agency has indeed released a lot of smoke screens, repeatedly reporting large-scale reinforcements. Indeed, on May 27, it cobbled together 400 assorted stragglers who attacked eastward from Yumenkou and Wu Wangdu. On May 29, more than 1,000 members of the Shaanxi County Security Regiment invaded the Pinglu area from Maojindu, making tentative harassments, but they were all driven away by us. Since then, not a single soldier has been sent to reinforce. It is rumored that the enemy is rushing to build river defense works along the Yellow River bank from Luoyang to Yumenkou day and night, and is collecting the remnants of the 206th Division and other units, totaling about four regiments, to defend this long river defense line. However, how can the broken limbs and remaining wreckage of Hu Zongnan, along with a belt of yellow water, save him from his tragic fate?

　　晋西南形势改观
  　胡蛮狗腿被扭断
    【新华社晋南前线三日电】本社特派记者穆欣报导晋西南形势称：陈赓将军常胜兵团四月横扫晋南，解放县城十九座及全部黄河渡口，五月下旬猛扑晋西，未及旬日，连克乡宁、汾城、襄陵、洪洞、蒲县、大宁六城，使胡蛮以三个旅以上代价换来的二十五座城及一年的苦心经营化为乌有，汾河下游数百里沃野大部解放，同蒲南线灵石南关到风陵渡七百里，目下为阎顽据守者已不到十分之一，山西全局为之改观，全省一○五座县城，人民解放军控制者超过四分之三。胡宗南伸进山西的一条狗腿被扭断了，陕北胡顽右翼裸露，其后方老巢亦受严重威胁。胡顽战线已呈解体之势。卅师及二○六师等各四个团困守临汾、运城六地孤岛，粮弹无着，仅赖空运接济。陷此天罗地网的鲁崇义（卅师师长）日夜求援。谣言公司中央社确也放了许多烟幕，屡传大举增援，不错，五月二十七日曾拼凑了四百杂顽分由禹门口和吴王渡东犯，二十九日陕县保安团千余自茅津渡侵犯平陆地区作试探性袭扰，但均为我驱逐。此后，迄无一兵一卒增援，近日据传敌正在洛阳至禹门口向黄河岸上星夜赶修河防工事，收罗整二○六师等共约四个团的残兵败将守此漫长河防。但是断肢残骸之胡蛮，一带黄水，怎能挽救了他的悲运呢？
