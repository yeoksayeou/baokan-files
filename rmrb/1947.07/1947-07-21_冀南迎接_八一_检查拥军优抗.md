Southern Hebei Welcomes "August 1st" Inspection, Supports the Army and Gives Preferential Treatment to Families of Revolutionary Soldiers and Martyrs
[This dispatch from our newspaper in Southern Hebei, dated the 19th] As "August 1st" approaches, the masses here are conducting inspections and reflections on supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, in order to welcome the birthday of the Chinese People's Soldiers—the Eighth Route Army. Since the 15th, the Southern Hebei Daily has continuously published, with great length, a chronology of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's heroic struggle for twenty years, stories of Jinggangshan, a factual account of the 25,000-li war history, and the heroic deeds of the Southern Hebei Eighth Route Army in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Patriotic Self-Defense War. Xinhua News Agency reporters in Southern Hebei have gone to various places to interview for "August 1st" news. Comrade Wang Renzhong of the District Party Committee, at a general meeting of party members in directly affiliated organs, emphatically called on party member cadres to actively participate in frontline work and strengthen the Liberation Army to participate in the great counter-offensive.
