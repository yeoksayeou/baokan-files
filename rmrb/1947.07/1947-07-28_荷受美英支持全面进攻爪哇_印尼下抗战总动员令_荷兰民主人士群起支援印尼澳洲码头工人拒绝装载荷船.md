　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Yogyakarta dispatch: Since the breakdown of Dutch-Indonesian negotiations and the large-scale offensive by Dutch troops, the Indonesian cabinet convened an emergency meeting on the 11th and issued a general mobilization order for the Indonesian War of Resistance. Indonesian ministers and military generals unanimously agreed that the current situation is the result of Dutch aggression. Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir issued a broadcast calling on the Indonesian people to take up arms to defend freedom and peace. He said: "Indonesia is a free country with its own government. We will never recognize any other government again, as we experienced during the painful years of Dutch and Japanese occupation." President Sukarno and Indonesian Commander-in-Chief Sudirman summoned "to answer every Dutch attack with a strike!"
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: Batavia dispatch: Dutch-Indonesian negotiations broke down on the 20th because the Dutch insisted on enslaving Indonesia. The Indonesian government's final request to submit the Indonesian issue to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for arbitration was also rejected by the Dutch. At midnight on the 20th, Dutch troops first launched an invasion of the Indonesian Republic's office in Batavia, and arrested Indonesian negotiating representatives Gani (Deputy Prime Minister), Thamrin (Deputy Director), and other Indonesian government officials stationed in Batavia. The Indonesian news agency and official publications were also sealed. A full-scale war has now begun in Java. Fierce battles are taking place in Bandung, Semarang, Malang, Surabaya and other places. The Dutch Air Force has also been sending out planes to indiscriminately bomb major cities and factories in the Indonesian liberated areas for days. Neutral observers in Batavia believe that the Dutch dare to persist in their policy of military coercion entirely because of the support of the United States and Britain.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: The Hague dispatch: After the Dutch government launched another war of aggression against Indonesia, Dutch democrats rose up in opposition, and Dutch workers have begun to launch a movement to support Indonesia. Dutch trade union leader Jenterla wrote to Dutch Prime Minister Beel on the 22nd, strongly advocating that the Netherlands should stop attacking Indonesia and seek a peaceful solution. The Executive Committee of the Dutch Seafarers' Union and the left-wing Unified Trade Union called on Dutch transport workers and seafarers to stop all actions that directly or indirectly help the Netherlands transport supplies to Indonesia. The "Dutch-Indonesian League," in which progressive people from all walks of life in the Netherlands participated, sent a telegram on the 21st to protest Mook's hard-line policy. The telegram pointed out: "The war against the Indonesian people will cause great disasters to the Netherlands and the Indonesian people." At the same time, the All-Netherlands Youth Federation has appealed to the World Federation of Democratic Youth, urging all countries in the world to stop the Dutch aggression.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 24th: Sydney dispatch: The Australian Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia recently issued a statement denouncing the crime of the Netherlands launching a war against Indonesia. It said: "If the Netherlands continues to use military pressure as before, the Federation will reject the agreement signed last time regarding the loading of Dutch ships, and Australian workers will refuse to load Dutch ships."
