Three Problems in Current Work
    Miao Zengquan
    Based on the situation in various regions, the following three issues in current work must be noted and resolved:

    (1) Eliminate abandoned arable land, replant, and weed seedlings.
    At the beginning of this year's spring plowing, the leadership's understanding of the labor shortage was conceptual and lacked precise calculation. Therefore, the call to eliminate abandoned arable land was not affirmative or forceful enough. In some places, the organization of auxiliary labor to participate in agricultural production was neglected. In addition, some farmers became complacent after land reform, looked down on poor land, or believed that cultivating distant and poor land was not worthwhile. The masses also held the idea that transportation was more important than agriculture. In some areas, farmers still had concerns about getting rich through production, so abandoned arable land increased generally. For example, in Songshuping, Zuoquan County, 280 mu were not planned for planting. In a natural village in Shixia, there were more than 490 mu of wasteland. The Second District planned to eliminate 6030 mu of abandoned arable land in the entire district. In Nanzhuang, Yushe County, in addition to the leadership attaching importance to eliminating 78 hectares of abandoned arable land, there were still more than 600 mu of abandoned arable land that had not been eliminated. It is estimated that there are more than 6,000 mu of abandoned arable land in Xiangyuan. Also, because this year's planting was carried out under the slogan of "both participation in the war and production should not be delayed", or was mainly completed by women and children, it caused the general crudeness of this year's planting, reduced planting of special crops, increased planting of crops required by the higher authority, and less fertilization. In short, the reduction of cultivated land area and the crudeness of planting have become a general and serious problem, which has considerably reduced grain production.

    Therefore, we must eliminate abandoned arable land to expand the cultivated area, and mobilize and organize the masses to weed and fertilize more carefully to compensate for the crudeness in planting, to increase grain production.

    1. First of all, the leading ideology must be clarified. After the realization of "land to the tiller", the labor intensity has been unprecedentedly improved. If we can pay attention to organizing auxiliary labor and further consolidate and improve mutual aid teams, today's labor force will still be sufficient. During the period of rush planting in Heshun and Xiyang, more than 25,000 male laborers participated, and the county's planting was not affected and was completed on schedule. After some villages in Yushe County had young and middle-aged men joining the army, the labor was surplus after calculating and organizing women, children, and old men to work in the fields. Therefore, we must not continue to be confused by the concept of labor shortage and relax the elimination of wasteland.

    2. Among cadres and labor heroes, we must establish a clear idea of ​​increasing grain production - only by increasing grain can we strongly support the front line and overcome the coming disaster; otherwise, military and civilian food will suffer very serious difficulties. Farmers say: "Land is a gold mine, and grain is the lifeline," and that is the significance. We should appropriately overcome the tendency of some cadres and the masses to neglect grain production and the growing tendency of emphasizing sideline occupations over agriculture, which is developing due to the pursuit of sideline profits. We should educate the masses that with good land and near land, do not forget the bad land and far land. Producing one more dou of grain will increase the strength to defeat Chiang Kai-shek and reduce the pain of disaster by one point. At present, we should seize all opportunities to carry out emergency planting and replanting.

    3. For land that is indeed far away, poor, and requires more labor and costs, we should persuade the masses to cultivate it, and we should take care of the burden by reducing the required output or deducting more land consumption. In short, we must make it profitable for farmers to cultivate the land. If the abandoned arable land cannot be cultivated due to the lack of labor in the village, it can be distributed to farmers in neighboring villages as much as possible, and the ownership can be determined. If it still cannot be resolved, the surplus labor of nearby mutual aid teams can be organized to engage in guerrilla cultivation, and the production income can be used as the sideline income of the team without increasing the burden.

    4. Weeding and replanting are now combined, so we must still pay great attention to saving manpower. We must not neglect it because the spring plowing season has passed and the order to stop dispatching labor has been lifted, and we must use the experience of farmers who pay attention to weeding to educate the masses. For example, "Weeding the seedlings an inch is better than applying fertilizer", "More weeding means full seeds, good color, drought resistance, high yield, delicious and easy to sell", and "Don't forget weeding in dry weather, and don't forget watering the garden in rainy weather" to get through the thinking of some people who neglect weeding.

    5. Agricultural farms in various counties and technical committees in various villages should strengthen their activities, study methods for weeding, preventing drought, and protecting seedlings, improve technology, and disseminate experience to guide current production work.

    (2) Rectify Mutual Aid Teams.
    We must turn formalistic, temporary, and unconsolidated mutual aid teams into useful, consolidated, and regular mutual aid organizations, and give full play to past experience to further organize, which is the key to successfully carrying out weeding and replanting to ensure increased grain production. Therefore, we should:

    1. Summarize the achievements and experiences of past organization, and use the masses' personal experience and seen benefits to improve the masses' awareness of being organized.

    2. Resolutely clean up the issue of equivalent exchange. All disputes, whether they are about non-equivalent exchange or disputes caused by rising grain prices due to untimely equivalent exchange, as well as the equivalent exchange of auxiliary labor participating in agricultural production or the division of profits in the family, should be resolved quickly so that no one suffers losses.

    3. For mutual aid teams that are not voluntarily organized, we must satisfy the demands of the masses and boldly let go and reorganize voluntarily. The experience of Heshun, Zuoquan, Yushe, and Xiangyuan has proven that this is the basic factor for consolidating mutual aid teams. It is not terrible that lazy people and individual idlers and households without labor are excluded from mutual aid. After education and solving the problem of equivalent exchange, it can be resolved.

    (3) Seriously Carry Out the Anti-Drought, Saving, and Disaster Preparedness Campaign.
    Since the beginning of spring, there has been no rain for a long time. Except for a few villages in Heshun and Zuoquan, all other places have been hit by drought, and some places have also found insect pests. In addition, this year's planting is rough, and the cultivated area is reduced. Although there has been rainfall in many places recently, disasters have already formed. War consumption is high, and society has no savings. Anti-drought, saving, and disaster preparedness have become one of the important tasks in our region. Therefore, we:

    First of all, we must recognize that the fluke mentality of paralysis is still the main enemy in our region's saving and disaster preparedness and must be overcome. For example, some people say: "If the seedlings are visible, then we have a 30% harvest. We have already grabbed the autumn seedlings here, so what are we afraid of?" "Even if it doesn't rain this year, it won't be as difficult as in 1942, right?" "Will there really be no harvest?" "We'll talk about it when the time comes, why worry now?" "It's hard to buy a drought in May," "A drought in May is not a drought, and a continuous rain in June will be enough to eat." "The living standards of the people here are already low, how else can we save?"

    Secondly, the leadership must establish the overall concept of the liberated area, educate the masses to focus on the worst and plan for the long term, and realize that even if it rains, disasters have already formed. We should use methods such as calculating family assets and recalling the suffering of the 1942 disaster to get through the masses' thinking, and promote the fine tradition of arduous struggle, using the spirit of fighting against feudalism and defending the interests of land reform to deal with this year's various disasters.

    In carrying out this campaign, cadres must take the lead and institutions and schools should set an example. Groups and individuals who lead well, do well, and achieve results in saving and disaster preparedness must be commended and rewarded.

### 当前工作中的三个问题

　　当前工作中的三个问题
    苗增泉
    根据各地情况，当前工作中有如下三个问题必须加以注意和解决：
　　（一）消灭熟荒补种锄苗。
    由于今年春耕一开始，领导上对缺乏劳力是概念了解，没有精确计算，故对消灭熟荒提的不够肯定有力，有的地方对组织辅助劳力参加农业生产忽视，加上农民翻身后有些自满，看不起坏地，或群众中认为种远地坏地不上算，耕田不如运输的重副轻农思想，以及某些地区农民在生产发家上还有顾虑，因此熟荒普遍增加。如左权松树坪有二八○亩不准备种，石匣一个自然村有荒地四百九十余亩，二区全区计划消灭熟荒六○三○亩。榆社南庄除领导上已重视消灭熟荒七八顷外，尚有六○○余亩熟荒未消灭。襄垣估计熟荒在六○○○亩以上。又因为今年下种是在参战生产两不误的口号下突击播种，或主要依靠妇女儿童完成的，故造成了今年下种上的普遍粗糙，特种作物减种，省工作物增加，上肥也少，总之耕地面积缩小和下种的粗糙，已是一个普遍的严重问题，相当减少了粮食产量。
    因此我们必须消灭熟荒扩大耕地面积，并发动和组织群众多锄细锄上追肥，以弥补下种上的粗糙，达到增产粮食。
    一、首先在领导思想上要明确起来，在耕者有其田实现后，劳动强度空前提高，如果我们能注意组织辅助劳力，进一步把互助组巩固提高的话，今天的劳力还是足足够用的。和顺昔阳在突击下种期二五○○○余男全劳力参加，全县下种没受到影响，仍能按期完成。榆社有的村青壮年参战后，经过计算和组织妇女儿童老汉下地，劳动有了剩余，因此不能被劳力缺乏的概念继续迷惑，放松了对荒地的消灭。
    二、在干部与劳英中，要树立明确的增产粮食思想——只有增加粮食，才能有力的支援前线，才能战胜正在袭来的灾荒，否则军需民食将会遭到非常严重的困难。农民说：“地是刮金板，粮食是命根”，意义就在这里。我们应适当克服某些干部群众中忽视增产粮食与由于追逐副业利润而正在发展着的重副轻农思想，教育群众有了好地近地，不要忘了坏地远地，多打一斗粮，就是增加打败蒋介石的一分力量，就能减少一分灾荒痛苦。目前应抓紧一切时机，进行抢种补种。
    三、对确因地远地坏费工多成本大的地，应说服群众耕种，我们应在负担上照顾减低应产量或多扣除土地消耗。总之要使农民种地有利可图，确因本村劳力缺乏种不过来之荒地，可尽量分配给邻村农民，确定所有权，仍不能解决者，可组织附近互助组之剩余劳力去游击耕种，生产所得做为该组副业收入，不增负担。
    四、锄苗补种已挤在一起，因此仍须十分重视节省民力，不能因春耕季节已过，停止支差命令已解除而忽视，并要用农民自己重视锄苗的经验，教育群众。如“谷锄一寸赛如上粪”，“多锄籽饱色好，耐旱产量大，耐吃又好卖”，以及“天旱不忘锄苗，雨涝不忘浇园”等打通某些群众忽视锄苗的思想。
    五、各县农场和各村技术委员会要加强活动，研究锄苗防旱保护禾苗等办法，提高技术，传播经验，以指导当前生产工作。
    （二）整顿互助组。
    要把形式主义的临时性的不巩固的互助组变为管用的巩固的经常性的互助组织，并发挥已往经验，进一步组织起来，这是胜利开展锄苗补种保证增产粮食的关键，因此我们应当：
    一、总结已往组织起来的成绩和经验，用群众亲身体验和看到的利益来提高群众组织起来的自觉。
    二、坚决清理等价问题，不论是未等价的或因等价交换不及时而粮价上涨引起的纠纷，以及辅助劳力参加农业生产的等价或与家庭分红等问题，都应迅速解决，做到互不吃亏。
    三、非自愿组织起来的互助组，要满足群众要求，大胆放手重新自愿结合。和顺左权榆社襄垣经验已证明这是巩固互助组的基本因素，尖头懒汉和个别游闲干部和无劳力户被排斥于互助之外亦不足怕，经过教育和解决等价交换问题后，都能得到解决。
    （三）认真开展抗旱节约备荒运动。
    入春以来，经久未雨，除和顺左权个别村外，各地都遭到旱灾的袭击，有的地方又发现虫灾。加上今年下种粗糙耕地面积缩小，最近虽有不少地方落雨，但灾荒已经形成，战争消费大，社会无积蓄，抗旱节约备荒已成为我区当前重要工作之一，因此我们：
    首先要认识侥幸麻痹思想仍是我区开展节约备荒的主要敌人而须加以克服，比如有的群众说：“见苗三分收，咱这里秋苗都捉住了还怕啥？”“今年不落雨，也不会象四二年那样困难吧？”“真得还会不收吗？”“到了什么时候说什么话，现在着急什么”？“有钱难买五月旱”，“五月旱不算旱，六月连阴吃饱饭。”“咱们这里群众生活水平就低，还能怎样节约”等。
    其次领导上必须树立解放区的整体观念，教育群众从最坏处着眼，从长期打算，认识即使落雨，灾荒已经形成，并用算家当回忆四二年灾荒痛苦等办法，打通群众思想，发扬坚苦斗争的优良传统，以土地改革中反封建保卫翻身利益的斗争精神来对待今年的各种灾荒。
    开展这一运动中，干部要亲自动手，机关学校应首起模范，对节约备荒领导的好做的好有成绩的团体及个人，都须给以表扬和奖励。（转载太行二专署工作通讯）
