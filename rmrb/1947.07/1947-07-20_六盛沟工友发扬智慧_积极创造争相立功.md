Since the launch of the meritorious service campaign in the Liushenggou Coal Mine, the workers have been full of confidence, actively innovating, and competing to achieve merit. The successful innovations made so far are introduced below:

	Boiler Modification
When installing a three-meter-long small boiler, the general method is: the fire enters from the core of the boiler, returns from the bottom, and then goes straight to the flue from both sides. In this way, the flame heat only circulates nine meters around the boiler, wasting coal and making the boiler slow to heat up. At this time, Director Sun and bricklayer Master Yang Xinshan conducted research and finally concluded that a wall should be built around the boiler and at the bottom, changing the original three holes into six, doubling the circulation path of the flame heat around the boiler to eighteen meters, which saves coal and speeds up the gas production.

	Water Pump Modification
The air pump installed in the well made a crashing sound when turned on. After careful research by mechanics Wu Dingxing and Ji Wengui, it was found that the water passage of the upper water valve was too small. Therefore, the water passage of the upper water valve was enlarged to allow the water outlet pipe to flow smoothly.

	Rope Deflection Wheel
No. 1 well continued to be excavated to find large coal seams, and the water inflow was very large. The winding engine constantly hoisted water in shifts so that work could be carried out in the well. However, the entanglement of the ropes became a direct obstacle to the work. Each time it took at least half an hour to untangle them, reducing the amount of water hoisted by forty bags, and forcing work to stop when the water level rose sharply. Wu Shouxiang, an old coal master, painstakingly studied the problem and invented two rope deflection wheels, which were nailed to the wooden beams at the wellhead. When an empty bag was lowered, the rope would be deflected onto the wheel, allowing the rope to descend along the side without getting entangled. However, when the bag reached the wellhead, the wheel was hindered. Model workers from the Mechanical Department further modified it, shortening the rope clips and making the wheel close to the wellhead beam, resulting in a more perfect success.

	Rope Clip Modification
The winding engine's overhead wheel often dropped the rope. Even with a clip installed, it didn't work. Zhang Dansheng, a purchasing agent, participated in the hook-up work on June 26th to support the front line and fulfill his voluntary labor. After the rope dropped several times, he carefully observed the overhead wheel and the rope, and found that the rope kept dropping to the west. He immediately studied the problem with Li Changfa, the head of the Mechanical Department, and found that the problem was that one side of the rope clip was too thin. After adding a shim, the rope no longer dropped.

	Ventilation
When No. 2 well was dug to a depth of ten or more zhang, the wind was strong, causing problems for the work, and there was a danger of suspending work. After Yang Xinshan racked his brains day and night, he came up with a very scientific solution based on the existing conditions: a rubber tube was connected to the bottom of the well, and the top of the well was connected to the large boiler chimney with a cement pipe. The draft of the chimney was used to circulate the air, which was very smooth, allowing work to be carried out with oil lamps lighting the well. These innovations have all been recorded as meritorious service and have been praised. (Collected by Zhongliang, Organized by Guojun)

    六盛沟工友发扬智慧
    积极创造争相立功
    六盛沟煤矿立功运动展开后，职工们个个信心百倍，积极创造争相立功，兹将已成功的点滴创造，介绍如下：
            改装锅炉
    装置三米长的小锅炉时，按一般的装法是：火从锅心进去，从底返回，再从两旁直奔烟口，这样火焰热度在锅炉周围仅有九米的流通径，费煤不催锅。这时孙主任便和瓦匠杨信山师傅进行研究，最后得出结论，在锅傍及锅底加垒一道墙，从前三个洞，现成六个洞，即加了一翻，使火焰热度在锅炉周围行径长了一倍，成为十八米，既省煤、气又上的快。
            修改水泵
    井下按的气泵，一开便逼的崩崩地叫，经机匠吴定兴、纪文贵同志细心研究，得知系上水门水路小之故，乃将上水互拉水路放大，出水管得以畅通输水。
            拨绳轮
    一号井继续下凿寻找大煤，水势很大，高车分刻不停的提水，井下才能进行工作，可是东西码绳纠缠打架，成了工作上的直接障碍，每次开解至少耽误半个钟头，少提四十包水，水势大涨，便得停止工作。吴守香老煤师遂苦心钻研，结果发明了两个拨绳轮，钉在井口木梁上，那码下空包就把绳拨到轮上，使绳顺傍而下，不再纠缠。但包至井口轮受羁绊，经机务股模范学习同志进一步又加以改造，缩短了绳卡子，使轮紧靠井口大梁，遂更完美的成功了。
            改造绳卡
    高车天轮常掉绳，按了个卡子还不行，张丹生同志是个采购员，六月二十六日，为了支援前线尽义务工，参加了把钩工作，不一会绳掉了好几次，他便很细心的注视天轮和绳，发现绳老往西掉，他马上和机务股长李长发同志共同研究，结果找到了绳卡一边垫薄的毛病，随即修改加垫绳掉不了。
            通风
    二号井打至十来丈深处，风大工作成问题，眼看便有停工之虞，经杨信山师傅日夜苦思，依现有条件想出了极科学的办法：用胶皮管子接到井底，井上接住用洋灰管接到大锅炉烟筒上，借烟筒吸力将风勾通，且甚畅顺，井下得以油灯照明进行工作。这些创造均分别记了功，得到表扬。（忠良搜集、国俊整理）
