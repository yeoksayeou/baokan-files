Weixian County, Songjiazhuang
　　Accumulating Manure in Preparation for Wheat Planting

[Report from our newspaper in Southern Hebei on the 29th] "It's a disaster to plant wheat without accumulating manure." Songjiazhuang in the Fourth District of Weixian County is making early plans for wheat planting and vigorously accumulating manure. The fifteen mutual aid groups in the village have unanimously decided: "Every household will exchange pot bottoms [a traditional method of composting], and seize the summer days to create green manure." Four pits have already been dug, and a manure-collecting team has been formed, with six people specifically collecting manure in the vicinity. This has now attracted the attention of the entire village.佟老选 (Tong Laoxuan), a peasant who turned over in Feixiang County's First District, often gets up before dawn to collect manure, collecting twenty large carts in half a year. All of it is applied to the fields, and the crops grow exceptionally stronger than in neighboring fields. He plans to accumulate ten more carts of manure before planting wheat, so he can apply it to the wheat fields. On the 22nd, the Southern Hebei Daily also used a short commentary to call for the vigorous promotion of the manure accumulation movement.
