Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 29th—Liberated farmers in Yu (Tian), Bao (Di), and Ning (He) counties of Eastern Hebei are actively building embankments along the canal and other rivers to prevent flooding. Men and women, young and old, from villages such as Tangzhupu, Nanbeixianzhuang in Yutian are rushing to build embankments. From May 4th to 13th, they completed 5,420 zhang of long embankments along the Huanxiang River and Ji Canal. They also dredged the Huanfengdui, Bajianfang, and Xihui three depressions. Most of the river bends in the Lujiapu area of the Ji Canal have been straightened, and new dikes have been rebuilt. The Ninghe engineering team worked tenaciously under enemy destruction and has completed the west dike of the Ji Canal from Gaotouwo to Hongfangzi section, and the east dike from Fengtai to Maisuigou section, totaling more than one hundred li of river dikes. The two major dikes of the Wugong River and Kuang'ergang River have been widened by an average of four chi and raised by two chi and seven cun in several dangerous sections totaling about twenty li. Two new dikes, one li long and one thousand four hundred and fifty zhang long, have been built, with a width of two zhang and two chi and a height of seven chi.
