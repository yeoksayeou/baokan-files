Xinhua News Agency, Frontline of Ji-Lu-Yu, 19th — The *People's Soldiers Daily* of the Political Department of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region Field Army, recently published an editorial entitled "Bravely Surround and Annihilate the Enemy, Letting Not a Single Enemy Escape," stating: "To further improve combat effectiveness, learn positional warfare, learn flanking tactics, bravely surround and annihilate the enemy, letting not a single enemy escape, completely eliminate the invading army, and seize enemy weapons and equipment for ourselves." This is an urgent and resolute call made to all commanders and soldiers of our People's Liberation Army in the "July 7th" anniversary slogans recently issued by the Central Committee. The timing of this slogan and call, not proposed in the past but precisely at the beginning of our entire liberated area launching a full-scale counter-offensive, is based on the fundamental change that has begun to occur in the overall military situation between the enemy and ourselves. Recent combat practice has proven the correctness of the Central Committee's slogan. Everyone has now felt that the enemy we are encountering this time seems to be better at escaping. When we were crossing the Yellow River, the enemies in the strongholds along the south bank of the Yellow River, despite Chiang Kai-shek's strict order to 'hold the river defense,' quickly fled. The enemy in Yuncheng almost escaped as well, but fortunately, our army acted swiftly and finally annihilated two brigades of Chiang's army. The enemy in Dingtao City initially seemed very calm, but as soon as they were surrounded, they desperately broke through, attempting to escape, but fortunately, they were intercepted again. The Jiaozong Brigade was advancing towards Cao County and had already reached the city walls, but upon hearing that there were regular troops of our army in the city, they fled in panic. This means that if our actions are slightly slower, if we do not boldly and quickly flank and surround the enemy, or if the encirclement is slightly lax, the enemy will escape. Commander Liu said: "The counter-offensive stage is a new stage; as the stage changes, the enemy's spirit and appearance also change. Our commanders at all levels must see this change in the enemy's spirit, bravely surround and annihilate the enemy, and falling behind in the old stage means falling behind." The new stage and new situation require us to have a new understanding and to timely change some of our outdated tactical thoughts and tactical actions, so that the combat effectiveness of the troops can be further improved in the new stage, and we can truly learn positional warfare and flanking tactics. "Bravely surround and annihilate the enemy, letting not a single enemy escape."

　　勇敢围歼敌人，不让跑掉一个！
  　野政人民战士报著论号召
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线十九日电】晋冀鲁豫军区野战政治部人民战士报，顷以“勇敢的包围歼灭敌人，不让一个敌人逃跑”题，发表社论称：“进一步提高战斗力，学习阵地战，学习迂回战术，勇敢的包围歼灭敌人，不让一个敌人逃跑，全部消灭进犯军，夺取敌人武器装备自己。”这是最近中央颁发“七七”纪念口号中向我们人民解放军全体将士提出的紧急的而又是坚决的号召。这一口号和号召，不在以往提出，恰恰在我们全解放区开始展开全面反攻之际提出，这是根据于敌我整个军事形势已开始发生基本变化。最近作战的实践，证明中央口号的正确性。现在大家都已经感觉到这回所遇到的敌人，好象是变得更善于逃跑了，当我们正在渡黄河时，黄河南岸沿线据点的敌人，虽有蒋介石“坚守河防”的严令，却很快便逃跑了。郓城之敌差一点也跑了，好在我军行动迅速，终于把蒋军两个旅全部歼灭。定陶城之敌原来似乎很沉着，但一被包围，便拚命突围企图逃跑，幸而复被截住。交总大队正向曹县前进，并已开抵城垣，但听说城内有我正规军，即仓惶逃窜。这就是说：如果我们的动作稍微慢一点，不会大胆迅速的迂回包围敌人，或包围而稍微有些松懈，敌人就逃跑了。刘司令员说：“反攻阶段，这是一个新的阶段；阶段变了，敌人的精神与面貌亦变了。我们各级指挥员必须看到敌人精神上的这种变化，勇敢的围歼敌人，停止在旧的阶段上就落后了。”新的阶段新的情况要求我们要有新的认识，及时改变我们某些不合时宜的战术思想和战术动作，使部队的战斗力在新的阶段中进一步的提高，真正学会阵地战，学会迂回战术。“勇敢的包围歼灭敌人，不让一个敌人逃跑。”
