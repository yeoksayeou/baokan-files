　　Tianji District Team
  　Dingtao Model of Struggle Against the Enemy
    The Tianji District Team, a model of anti-enemy struggle in Dingtao County, is a small armed force of less than thirty people. Under the leadership of District Chief Zhou Mingxuan and Instructor Yan Chuanfa, they have fought the Chiang Kai-shek army nearly fifty times since the beginning of the self-defense war last year. Under the countless "encirclements and suppressions" and sweeps by the enemy, they have always held their ground in the area, without retreating a single step. When the enemy's initial momentum was at its peak, the Tianji District Team temporarily withdrew to Hebei. As soon as the enemy's momentum subsided, they immediately returned. They first summoned the puppet Bao chiefs for a meeting. The district team was divided into groups of three, advancing "side by side" towards the city gates, covering the masses attending the meeting. Once, when a meeting was in progress, the enemy came out. The Tianji District Team fired their guns everywhere, causing the enemy to panic and retreat back into the city, firing artillery and machine guns aimlessly outside the city for more than an hour. The meeting concluded successfully, and the people of Tianji District thus saw their own democratic government again.
    As the struggle became increasingly fierce, the enemy launched many sweeps, attempting to annihilate this small armed force. However, District Chief Zhou's "Father, Brother, and Son Soldiers" (Zhou's father was the head of the Federation, and his younger brother was a member of the district team) always held their ground in the hinterland, never leaving Tianji District. The prestige of Zhou Mingxuan and Yan Chuanfa shook the hearts of the bad elements in the city, causing them headaches and panic.
    On March 24th, the enemy and puppets suddenly arrested all of District Chief Zhou's family members and brought them to the city, shamelessly sending a letter to District Chief Zhou, saying: "Come to the city and work, and we will still let you be the district chief." District Chief Zhou is an outstanding member of the Chinese Communist Party who has been tempered for eight years. He would not be shaken in the slightest by threats, but instead became even more determined. He controlled and detained more than twenty families of puppet officials in the entire district, resolutely telling the city: "If you kill one, I will kill all of yours." This frightened the puppet County Chief Li Yiqing into releasing District Chief Zhou's family members on the 28th.
    In order to remove the thorn in their side – the Tianji District Team – the enemy devised a plan. Led by the bad element Wang Shuqing, they formed a small team and launched a long-distance raid to attack us. On April 20th, after discovering that our Federation and district team were stationed in Zhangzhuang, they rushed to surround it. Just as they were about to break down the door, some timid enemies said: "It's going to be a loss fighting with these sons of bitches in Tianji District Team who don't value their lives!" Therefore, the enemy ran away again, using dense fire to block the door. At this time, a veteran of the district team who had previously served in the Ninth Regiment stepped forward. He stuck several grenades in his belt, gently opened the door, crawled out with his belly to the ground, and unexpectedly threw a grenade at the enemy. The enemy fled carrying four wounded. From then on, the landlord armed forces dared not raid them again.

### 田集区队　定陶对敌斗争模范

　　田集区队
  　定陶对敌斗争模范
    定陶县的对敌斗争模范——田集区队，是一支不到卅个人的小武装，在区长周明旋指导员阎传法领导下，从去年自卫战争开始成立到现在，和蒋军作战将近五十次。在敌人无数次清剿扫荡下，他们始终坚持着地区，没有后退一步。当敌人第一次风头刚到时，田集区队暂撤到河北，敌人风头一过，他们便马上返回去。他们首先召集伪保长开会，区队分成三人一组，向城关“齐头并进”，掩护群众开会。一次会议正在进行时，敌人出来了，田集区队便到处放枪，敌人恐慌万状，退回城里，用大炮机枪向城外毫无目标的射了一个多钟头，会议圆满结束，田集区人民就这样重见了自己的民主政府。
    斗争越来越尖锐，敌人多次扫荡，企图歼灭这支小武装，但周区长的“父兄子弟兵”（按周父为联合会组长，弟为区队队员），始终坚持着腹地，没离田集区一步。周明旋、阎传法的威名震摇着城里坏蛋的心，使他们头痛心慌。
    三月二十四日，敌伪突然把周区长的家属，全部抓到城里，无耻的给周区长捎信说：“来城里干吧，同样叫你当区长。”周区长是经过八年锻炼的中共优秀党员，他不会因受到威胁而丝毫动摇，反而更坚决了。他把全区二十多家伪属全部控制扣押，果断的告诉城里：“你杀一个，我就给你们杀光。”吓得伪县长李一清连忙于二十八号放出了周区长的家属。
    敌人为了要拔掉他的眼中钉——田集区队，想出了一条计策，由坏蛋王树清率领，组成一股小队伍，以远道奔袭向我进攻。四月二十日侦知我联合会和区队驻在张庄，就赶往包围。正要破门而入时，有些胆小的敌人说：“跟田集区队这个不要命的孙子干，可要吃亏呀！”因此敌人又跑开，以密集射击封锁着门口。这时区队一位原在九团干过的荣誉军人，首先挺身而出，他腰里插上几个手榴弹，轻手轻脚的打开门，用肚皮贴着地爬出去，冷不防的给敌人投过去一个手榴弹，敌人背着四个重彩号逃跑了。从此以后，地主武装再也不敢来奔袭他们了。
