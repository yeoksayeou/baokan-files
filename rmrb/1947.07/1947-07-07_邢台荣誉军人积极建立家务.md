　　Xingtai Honored Veterans Actively Establish Households

　　[This newspaper's Xingtai news] Xingtai convened a county-wide symposium of honored veterans to discuss the issue of establishing households in the process of emancipation and production. A total of one hundred and fifty-eight people attended, of whom forty-one were village cadres, and the others also participated in various organizations of farmers' associations and production. During the symposium, everyone exchanged experiences and discussed many model deeds in emancipation and production: For example, Comrade Miao Changshan from Chongshuiyu, a first-class disabled veteran with both legs amputated, bought a donkey with his saved grain. Wherever he went, he did not ask the masses for assistance; he cut grass and fed the animal himself. What the livestock couldn't eat was sold for money. This spring, he spun thirty catties of cotton, earning a wage of twelve thousand yuan, which solved his own clothing and spending money difficulties. Comrade Wang Mingrang from Xihuang Village, a first-class disabled veteran with one leg amputated, returned from the army this January. He learned to spin cotton. At first, he spun two liang a day, and within a month, he spun half a jin. Later, the government promoted accelerated spinning wheels. Women didn't believe it, so he first studied how to use them and then promoted them. Now he can spin one jin and four liang of first-class thread a day. This spring, he spun more than forty catties of thread, solving the clothing problem for his entire family of seven. He participates in mutual aid and feeds silkworms at home for the group, and the group members cultivate the land for him, without relying on the village for cultivation assistance. Others, such as the mutual aid groups led by Zhang Zongxiu, Qiao Jindang, Cao Fengyin, and Zhang Zhu, have become models for the entire village. The cooperatives led by Li Guanggui and Li Shixiu launched textile production this spring, achieving self-sufficiency in clothing for the entire village and even having a surplus. After examining their relationships with village cadres and the masses, they unanimously proposed: When the relationship is not good, first examine yourself. We shed blood for the masses, and now we must sweat for the people, cherish our honor, integrate with the masses, and actively produce in response to the government's call. (Song Anxiang)

　　邢台荣誉军人积极建立家务
    【本报邢台讯】邢台召开全县荣誉军人座谈会，讨论在翻身和生产中的建立家务问题。共到会一百五十八人，其中当村干部的四十一人，其他也都参加了农会和生产的各种组织。座谈中大家交流经验，谈出不少在翻身和生产中的模范事迹：如崇水峪苗长善同志，一等双腿残废，用自己节省下的粮食买了个驴，往哪里走不向群众要差，自己割草喂，牲口吃不了还卖钱，今春四个月纺花三十斤，赚工资一万二千元，解决了自己穿衣和零花困难。西黄村王明让同志一等一个腿残废，今年正月从队伍上回来，他学习纺花，开始一天纺二两，一月头上纺到半斤，后来政府提倡加速轮纺车，妇女不相信，他就先研究使用，以后推广，现一天能纺头等线一斤四两，今春共纺线四十多斤，解决了全家七口人的穿衣问题。参加互助，在家给组内喂蚕，组员给他种地，不用村中代耕。其他如张宗秀、乔金党、曹凤银、张朱等领导的互助组都成了全村模范，李光贵、李士秀领导的合作社，今春开展纺织，达到全村穿衣自给还有余。检讨到和村干部群众的关系后，一致提出：关系不好时先要检查自己。咱们为群众流过血，现在更要为人民流汗，爱护自己的荣誉，与群众打成一片，积极生产响应政府号召。（宋安祥）
