　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 30th: Paris dispatch: The labor unrest in France is expanding daily. Nearly 200,000 coal miners are participating in the strike. The strike began in the northern mines, and on the 27th, miners in the central and southern regions also joined the strike. Production losses are estimated at over 90,000 tons per day. French newspapers have recently speculated that the Ramadier government is in danger of collapsing due to the strike movement launched by coal miners in opposition to government measures.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st: The strike movement in France is developing daily; the miners' strike has effectively spread to all coal mining areas in the country. Bank employees are also on strike, and their strike committee has decided to halt all payments by the banks, including wage payments. Workers at the Citroen automobile factory and many other business sectors continue to strike. The miners' strike is hindering the normal operation of trade agencies and government departments. The Minister of Industry, Lacoste, met with representatives of the miners yesterday and seemed to have reached an agreement that would satisfy the workers. However, at the last minute, the government refused to meet the miners' demands. In light of this tense situation, the French government held meetings from morning till night on June 27, but opinions differed. Next week, the National Assembly will discuss a formal inquiry into the government's economic policy, at which time a vote of confidence in the Ramadier government may be proposed. "Liberation" newspaper, in assessing possible changes in the composition of the cabinet, wrote: Deputy Prime Minister Teitgen (a member of the Popular Republican Movement) expressed his opinion in favor of expanding the government. "L'Humanité" solemnly pointed out the lack of unity within the government, writing: "Only by establishing a democratic government on the basis of a coalition of the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the Popular Republican Movement – a proposition that the Communist Party has insisted on for the past two years – is there now a possible solution."

　　法国全境煤矿罢工
  　各银行职员亦停止工作
  　拉马第政府有垮台危险
    【新华社陕北卅日电】巴黎讯：法国工潮已日渐扩大。煤矿罢工参加者近二十万人。罢工系于北部矿场开始，二十七日中部及南部矿工亦参加罢工。生产损失估计每日在九万吨以上。法国报纸最近纷纷推测：拉马第政府将因煤矿工人反对政府措施所举行的罢工运动而有垮台危险。
    【新华社陕北一日电】法国的罢工运动正日益发展，矿工的罢工实际上已波及全国一切煤矿区。银行职员亦在罢工中，其罢工委员会已决定停止各银行的一切支付，工资的支付亦包括在内。“西特隆”汽车工厂及其他许多企业部门的工人仍继续进行罢工。矿工的罢工则妨碍贸易机关与政府机关的正常工作。工业部长拉科斯特于昨日接见矿工代表，似已获致使工人满足的协议。但在最后的一分钟内，政府还拒绝满足矿工的要求。鉴于此种紧张的局势，法国政府在六月二十七日从早到晚均举行会议，惟意见分歧。下周国会将讨论有关政府经济政策的正式质问，届时，可能提出对拉马第政府投信任票的问题。“解放”报在估计内阁组成的可能变动时写道：部长会议副主席泰根（人民共和运动党人）发表意见，赞成扩大政府。人道报郑重指出政府内部缺乏团结，写道：“现在只有在社会党、共产党、人民共和党联合的基础上建立一民主政府，这是共产党过去两年来所坚持主张的。”
