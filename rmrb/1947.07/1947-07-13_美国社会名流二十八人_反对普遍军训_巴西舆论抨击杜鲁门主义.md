Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 10th: Washington dispatch: Twenty-eight American social elites, including Daniel, who served as the Secretary of the Navy during World War I, Hutchins, the President of the University of Chicago, and Mueller, the President of the University of Detroit, have recently published a statement in the press opposing the Universal Military Training Bill. The statement said: "America's true security lies in abolishing universal military training, implementing a universal disarmament plan, and strengthening unity." The statement advocates implementing a reconstruction plan, including the Soviet Union, to assist all countries, and strengthening democracy within the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 9th: Rio de Janeiro, July 7th: Brazilian public opinion strongly criticizes the highly aggressive Truman Doctrine. The Brazilian newspaper "The Debater" recently published an article commenting on the Pan-American Standardization of Armaments Conference to be held in Rio de Janeiro, stating: "Under the pretext of defending the Americas, the United States is attempting to standardize the armaments of South American countries in order to turn these countries' armies into its auxiliary forces." Brazilian Congressman Pomar also recently denounced the United States' dollar diplomacy and Truman's armaments standardization plan in a speech to the House. He said: "If anyone is threatening South America, it is imperialist North America (referring to the United States)."
