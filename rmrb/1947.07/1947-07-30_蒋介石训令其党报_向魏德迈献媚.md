Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th. Chiang Kai-shek, anxious to beg his American masters for help, has recently made a series of ugly moves. According to a United Press dispatch from Nanjing on the 26th, citing the most reliable sources, the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters has instructed all party newspapers to emphasize that "the United States should play a role in China's post-war reconstruction" (meaning the United States should enslave China), demanding swift and large-scale American aid, and instructing the newspapers to "assist and supply the Wedemeyer mission with all materials concerning China's military and economic situation." The instructions also demanded that the newspapers clamor that "certain foreign writers have unconsciously become victims of CCP propaganda and irresponsibly criticize China's only legitimate government," hinting at the hope that the U.S. government would persecute objective, liberal American journalists. According to another report, Wedemeyer suffered from "headaches" after arriving in Nanjing. Chiang's Central News Agency hastily published a lengthy dispatch of more than 480 words on the 26th, saying that Nanjing's "temperature is high and humidity is heavy, making it unbearably muggy, which is normal for this time of year and not surprising." It painstakingly sought a weather-related reason for Wedemeyer's "headaches," displaying an utterly servile demeanor!

　　蒋介石训令其党报
  　向魏德迈献媚
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】蒋介石为了急于要求美国主子救命，最近弄得丑态百出。据美联社南京二十六日电引最可靠方面消息，国民党中央党部顷训令所有党报齐起强调“美国应在中国战后复兴中有作用”（按指美国应奴役中国），要求美国迅速大量援助，训令各党报“以一切关于中国军事、经济形势的材料协助与供给魏德迈使团”。训令又要求各报叫嚣“某些外国作家已不自觉地成为中共宣传的牺牲品，并以最不负责的态度批评中国唯一合法的政府”，暗示希望美国政府对客观的自由主义的美国记者加以迫害。据另息，魏德迈抵南京后曾患“头痛症”，蒋记中央社仓忙于二十六日发表了一条长达四百八十余字的电讯，说南京“温高湿重，溽热难当，论时期言固属正常，无足怪也。”晓晓为魏氏之“头痛症”寻求天时原因，奴相可掬！
