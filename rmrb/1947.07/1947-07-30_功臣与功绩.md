　　Heroes and Merits

　　Comrade Bi Gefei, the head of the propaganda section of the military region's political department, participated in frontline combat operations several times and went deep into company-level work during the year of the self-defense war. During the Yuanqu campaign last winter, he went to work at the × brigade × regiment and discovered the typical example of Jiao Wubao leading new soldiers, providing materials to the military region, and the troops launched the Jiao Wubao movement. The prominent characteristics of his working method are: everything starts from the big picture, starts with the small details, is specific, and goes deep into reality. He values the creativity of the masses and does not ignore anything ordinary. For example, when he participated in combat, he examined the terrain, enemy fortifications, and our army's access roads after the battle, and then casually chatted with the soldiers about the battle process and work situation, discovering the true hero models from it. At the beginning of the Jinan campaign, he went to Jiao Wubao's regiment and found that the mutual aid movement had achieved great results, so he decided to summarize the experience of the mutual aid groups. After a month or so of effort, he visited many group leaders and members, and he summarized the ten major benefits of mutual aid and meritorious service. He compiled the summary into a simple narrative and read it to the soldiers in the company, asking the soldiers for their opinions and revisions. He revised it again and read it again, asked again, and revised again. The soldiers were very happy and said: "These are all our affairs. We do it but don't know how to say it. Using our things to teach us is the best." Comrade Gefei has been elected as a special-class model worker many times and has now won the title of special-class hero.

　　Comrade Su Jingshi, who was transferred from the Great Military Region last year to work in this area, helped to reorganize the Taiyue Radio Station, and encountered great difficulties from the beginning. There were no materials, they could not be bought, and they could not be requisitioned. To repair a machine, it was very difficult to find a copper sheet and a lamp holder. Once, his messenger brought him a few things he needed, and he strangely asked where they came from! Later, he discovered that there was a pile of discarded electrical materials thrown on a building. This building had no doors or windows, and the discarded materials were mixed with the bran of the common people. He actually found twelve usable transformers from this pile of materials, as well as six or seven radios that had been carried on light balloons released by American imperialism in the past, and more than twenty capacitors that were very difficult to obtain. Then he began to reorganize. The original plan was to reorganize three in January to March, first reorganizing one. The test sound was good, so the radio stations of various troops came automatically without being transferred. From January to March, Comrade Jingshi, with only one assistant, worked day and night. By April, he had reorganized twenty transmitters and sixteen receivers. Temporary repairs are not counted. On average, he reorganized one transmitter every six days. The sound of all the reorganized ones was better and smoother than before. When Comrade Jingshi was working, he considered every machine part, even a screw, over and over again, using it in the appropriate place. In the extremely difficult situation of materials, he also paid great attention to economy. Every time he assembled a machine, he carefully sought the opinions of the radio operators. One of his messengers, after several months of education, was able to assemble a machine by himself.

　　功臣与功绩
    毕革飞同志，是军区政治部的宣传科长，自卫战争一年中，他曾几次参加前线部队作战，深入连队工作。去冬垣曲战役，他去×旅×团工作，发现了焦五保带领新战士的典型，给军区提供材料，部队开展了焦五保运动。他的工作方法，显著的特点是：一切从大处着眼，小处着手，具体、深入实际。重视群众的创造，不忽视任何平凡的东西。比如他参加作战，战后察看了地形，敌方工事，和我军开进道路，然后再去和战士漫谈战斗经过和工作情况，从中发现真正的英雄模范。晋南战役开始，他走到焦五保团上发现互助运动获得很大效果，也就决定总结互助组经验，经个把月的努力，访问了许多组长和组员，他总结了互助立功十大好处，把总结编成板话，到连里给战士念，请战士提意见修改。改了再念，再提，再改，战士们很高兴说：“这都是我们的事情，我们做了不会说，拿我们的东西教我们，最好。”革飞同志曾多次当选特等模范工作者，这次又荣膺特等功臣。
    苏景轼同志，去年从大军区调来本区工作，帮助整理改装太岳电台，一开始就碰到很大困难。没有材料，买不到，领不来，修理一部机器，找个铜片和灯座都很困难。有一次他的通讯员给他找来几件他需用的东西，他很奇怪的追问是那里来的！以后发现一座楼上扔着废烂电器材料。这座楼没门没窗废材料和老百姓糠秕杂在一起。他从这一堆材料中竟找出十二个能使用的变压器，和过去美帝国主义所放轻气球上带着的电台六七个，还有很不易得的电容器等廿多个，接着开始改装，原规定一月至三月先改装三个，首先改装一个。试验声音良好，于是各部队的电台不等抽调，就自动来了。从一月至三月，景轼同志，只在一个助手帮助下，夜以继日的工作，至四月间竟改装出二十部发报机，此外还改装十六部收报机。临时修理还不算，平均六天改装出一部发报机，凡改装过的声音都好了，比过去顺利了。景轼同志在工作时，对每一个机器零件，甚至一个螺丝都要再三考虑，用到适当的地方去。在材料极困难的情况下，他还极注意节约，每装起一部机器，就仔细征求报务员同志的意见。跟他的一个通讯员，经过几个月的教育，已能自己装出一部机器。
