　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 19th: Tens of counties in the Jiluyu Yellow River South Bank, the militia and guerrillas, and millions of people are fully mobilized to coordinate with the counter-attacking army under Liu Bocheng, bravely attacking the Chiang Kai-shek troops and the "Homecoming Corps" to take revenge. When the People's Liberation Army besieged Yuncheng, the local people established a defense line of more than 100 li in the south of the city, including Shiqiao, Chenlizhang, Xugai, Huangyan, and Yinma, with posts set up in every village and patrols day and night. Old men, women, and children dispersed and hid in the sorghum fields, monitoring the enemy and forming a dragnet. In the days before and after the recovery of Yuncheng, the sound of gunfire intercepting Chiang Kai-shek's scattered soldiers was heard everywhere. Many farmers seized guns and captured prisoners. According to incomplete statistics, Yuncheng County captured a total of 235 Chiang Kai-shek's 55th Division Battalion Commander Zhang Haisheng and 400 members of the "Ganzihui", seized 2 machine guns, 1 automatic rifle, and other military supplies. The local armed forces of the 5th Military District intercepted the 153rd Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek army reinforcing Dingtao in Yangwan, Kaocheng, capturing more than 100 alive and seizing 4 heavy machine guns and 11 light machine guns. Another 300 or so of the enemy broke through from Dingtao and retreated in defeat, and were completely captured by our Qi (Bin) Kao (Cheng) He (Ze) county armed forces and farmers who were hoeing the fields, seizing 1 mortar and 20 light machine guns. On the 7th of this month, the Wu Gong team of Linze County intercepted the 13th Regiment of the 29th Brigade of the 55th Division fleeing from Yuncheng to Heze. After five minutes of fierce fighting, 19 were captured alive, and all their personal weapons were seized. The districts of the county also organized detachment teams that were separated from production to take revenge, to wipe out hidden special agents, "Homecoming Corps" and other bad guys. In Yunbei County alone, more than a thousand people fell into the net of justice. The blasting campaign is now being widely launched. Zhao Bingxiang's blasting team in Junan County advanced to the north of the Longhai Railway and killed 15 soldiers of Chiang Kai-shek's 15th Army in four days.
