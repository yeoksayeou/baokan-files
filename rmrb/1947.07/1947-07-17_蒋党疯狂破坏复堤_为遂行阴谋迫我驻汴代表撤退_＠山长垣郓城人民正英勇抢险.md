Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 1st (Delayed Telegram): Chiang Kai-shek expelled Zhao Mingfu, the representative of the Liberated Areas stationed in Kaifeng, and refused to cooperate with the Liberated Area government on the Yellow River issue in order to carry out his conspiracy to destroy the Yellow River levees and flood the Liberated Areas. After the Chiang side closed the gap and released water on March 15th, the Chiang government immediately notified our representative stationed in Kaifeng on April 14th to stop communication immediately on the grounds that "the Garden Mouth has been closed, and there is no need to contact the CCP radio station." On May 17th, Chiang's Executive Yuan issued Instruction No. 1826 of Mangri, ordering its Ministry of Water Resources and the Yellow River Commission to formally announce the termination of relations between the Kaifeng Yellow River Commission and the representatives of the Liberated Areas stationed in Kaifeng, and notified our representative, saying: "The Communist Party has no business with the Yellow River Commission, and should not be entertained." Our representative stationed in Kaifeng, Zhao Mingfu, was forced to withdraw on the afternoon of May 17th. Recently, the Chiang government has been touting so-called "ceasefire" and "restoration of dikes", proving the above facts, and its ulterior motives are self-evident.

This newspaper's telegram from Jiluyu on the 14th: After the first phase of the Puyang section of the Yellow River repair project was completed before the wheat harvest, the second phase of the project was originally scheduled to begin on June 15th, but because the Chiang army in the Xiaowang stronghold (only four miles away from the river construction section) harassed day and night. At the same time, in order to facilitate the sabotage of our levee repair activities, the sorghum seedlings within six or seven miles were forcibly cut down by the masses. Seeing the Liu and Deng armies crossing the Yellow River, the enemy fled at the sound of the wind, and the Chiang bandits continued to harass and destroy with planes. On July 5th, from 8:00 am to 11:00 am, Chiang's planes harassed as many as nine times within three hours, each time with more than two planes, bombing and strafing, causing heavy losses to us, so that the levee repair workers and vehicles did not dare to move. Now that the big flood is approaching, the democratic government has decided to concentrate its efforts on repairing dangerous works. The original second phase of earthwork was 80,000 cubic meters, now changed to 40,000 cubic meters, and Puyang, Nanwang, and Dongping counties are designated to transport 10,000 cubic meters of stone, all as a surprise task, calculated at three carts per cubic meter, resulting in 2,000 carts for half a month. In addition, Nanwang is responsible for 800 large carts of willow branches (equivalent to 400,000 catties) and 700,000 catties of Puyang materials, in order to rush to repair the stone dams and prevent accidents. They are currently working hard day and night.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 14th: The levee restoration project in the edge area of Changyuan County has been under armed repair since it started on the 22nd of last month under the slogan of "fight the enemy when they come, repair when they don't." On the first day of construction, the enemy in the city of Changyuan came to harass the Yujia field area of the eighth district, killing more than fifty of our levee workers. Upon hearing the news, our militia rushed to drive them back. The Chiang army stationed in Xiwangzhai, west of the levee, surrounded our levee workers in the seventh district and intercepted our transportation of stone materials in Wuzhuang, all of which were driven back by our militia and levee workers working together. The county's levee restoration project is continuing.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 12th: At 1:00 pm on the 2nd of this month, when more than 4,000 farmers in Zhangqiu were rushing to repair the dangerous work from Yanying to Taochengpu, three American-made Chiang planes suddenly flew from the northeast, flying low and circling, dropping seventeen bombs, and strafing with machine guns for up to two hours, killing and wounding three levee workers, destroying five civilian houses, and killing two oxen. Levee worker Huang Yongxian was blown to pieces, his abdomen broken and intestines flowing out, a tragic sight. Two farmers who were farming near the levee were also tragically killed. Now the levee repair workers are filled with grief and anger, and are still rushing to repair the levee at the risk of their lives.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 12th: More than 70,000 liberated farmers from Jiluyu's sixth district, including Renping, Boping, Zhuxian, Dong'a, Hexi, and Qiyu counties, braved the summer heat and the constant harassment of the Chiang army on the opposite bank, and since June 15th, they have been rushing to repair the Lin Huang levee from Taochengpu to Qiyu and the Jin levee from Wangting to Qiyu, stretching for more than 300 li. Under the slogan of "repairing the levee to save ourselves," the masses launched a digging competition. The original plan was for each person to dig two cubic meters of soil per day, but now each person can dig an average of five cubic meters of soil. Gao Shuzi, Gao Changcheng, Wu Fenghe and other three labor models from the seventh district of Zhuxian dug fourteen and two-sevenths cubic meters each in one day, and were hailed as "digging kings." As of the 28th of last month, the repair project of this section of the levee has been fully completed.

Xinhua News Agency, Jiluyu Frontline, 15th: The newly liberated people of Yuncheng are rushing to repair the dangerous works on the river embankment to prevent major floods. After the Chiang army occupied Yuncheng in March, it used this as the central military base on the front line of the southern bank of the Yellow River, building fortresses in villages and towns parallel to the coast for fifteen to twenty miles, and transforming the terrain. In addition to demolishing the West Gate of the city, the Southeast Gates were built into independent fortresses, forming a mutually supporting position with the city. The original square fortresses were rebuilt into circles, with secret bunkers densely built on them. Deep ditches one and a half feet wide were dug around the fortresses, and landmines were laid between the two ditches. It is estimated that this huge project cost more than 300,000 man-days; the people not only lost the opportunity to cultivate the land, but also lost the ability to build dikes to prevent floods. Fortunately, Liu Bocheng's army arrived before the major flood, and the democratic government immediately carried out post-disaster relief work, and at the same time mobilized the people to build dikes to prevent floods. More than 10,000 people are rushing to the river bank to deal with the danger.

    蒋党疯狂破坏复堤
    为遂行阴谋迫我驻汴代表撤退
    ＠山长垣郓城人民正英勇抢险
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫一日电】（迟到）蒋介石驱逐解放区驻汴代表赵明甫，拒绝在黄河问题上与解放区政府合作，以遂行其破坏黄河复堤水淹解放区阴谋。三月十五日蒋方合龙放水后，蒋政府即于四月十四日以“花园口业已合龙，与中共电台已无联系必要”之理由，通知我驻汴代表即日停止通报。至五月十七日蒋记行政院又发出茫日字第一八二六号训令，令其水利部及黄委会，正式宣布开封黄委会与解放区驻开封代表断绝关系，并通知我代表称：“共方与黄委会业务已无关系，应即不予招待。”我驻开封代表赵明甫氏当于五月十七日下午被迫撤离。最近蒋政府高唱所谓“停战”“复堤”，证明上述事实，其别具用心已不言而喻。
    【本报冀鲁豫十四日电】＠山段修黄工程麦收前完成第一期计划后，第二期工程本定于六月十五日开工，但因小王据点（距河工段仅四里）之蒋军，昼夜袭扰，同时为了便于破坏我方修堤活动，竟把六七里以内的高粱苗，强迫群众砍掉。看到刘、邓大军渡过黄河后，该敌闻风逃窜，蒋贼更不断以飞机袭扰破坏，七月五日上午八时至十一时三个钟头以内，蒋机袭扰即达九次之多，每次均在两架以上，投弹扫射，我损失极重，以至修堤民夫车辆不敢活动。现因大泛已近，民主政府特又决定集中力量抢修险工，原定二期土工为八万方，现在改为四万方，并派定＠山、南旺、东平三县运石一万方，均突击任务，按每方拉三车计算，得两千辆大车拉整半个月。此外，又由南旺负担柳枝八百大车（合四十万斤）及＠山料七十万斤，以便赶修石坝，预防出险。刻正昼夜积极赶修中。
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十四日电】长垣边缘区复堤工程，自上月二十二日动工后，在“敌（长垣城内之敌）来就打、不来就修”的口号下，武装抢修。动工第一天，城内敌出扰八区余家场一带，杀我堤工五十余，我民兵闻讯，驰往将其击退。驻堤西王砦蒋军将我七区堤工包围，并在吴庄截击我运输石料，均为我民兵和堤工合力驱退。全县复堤工程，正继续进行中。
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十二日电】本月二日下午一时，我张秋四千余农民，抢修颜营至陶城铺险工时，突有自东北方向飞来美制蒋机三架，低飞盘旋，投弹十七枚，并以机枪扫射前后达两小时，死伤堤工三人，毁民房五间，耕牛两头。堤工黄永先被炸得血肉横飞，肚破肠流，惨不忍睹。在河堤附近种地之两个农民，亦惨遭炸死。现修堤员工悲愤填膺，仍冒死抢修中。
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十二日电】冀鲁豫六分区荏平、博平、筑先、东阿、河西、齐禹等县七万余翻身农民，冒着暑热及对岸蒋军不断袭扰，自六月十五日起，昼夜抢修自陶城埠至齐禹临黄堤及自王厅至齐禹金堤，长达三百余里。群众在“修堤自救”的口号下，掀起挖土竞赛，原计划每人每日挖两方土，现每人平均能挖五方土。筑先七区劳动模范高树资、高长城、武凤和等三人，每人一天挖了十四方二分七，被誉为“挖土大王”。截至上月二十八日，该段修堤工程已全部告成。
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线十五日电】新获解放的郓城人民正突击抢修河堤险工，以防大汛。蒋军三月间侵占郓城后，即以此作为黄河南岸最前线的中心军事基地，在沿岸平行十五里至二十里之村镇修筑城寨，改造地形。除拆毁该城西关外，并将东南两关修成独立城寨，与城互为犄角。复将原来之方形城寨改建圆形，于上密筑暗堡。又在城寨周围挖掘丈五宽之深沟，两沟之间布设地雷。估计此巨大工程，耗费民力当在三十万工以上；人民不仅耕作失时，且失筑堤防泛能力。幸刘伯承大军大泛前开到，民主政府一面立时进行善后工作，同时动员民众筑堤防泛，万余民众正涌上河岸抢险。
