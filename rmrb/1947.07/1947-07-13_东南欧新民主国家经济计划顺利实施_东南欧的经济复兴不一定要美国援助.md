Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th. According to various sources: The economic plans of the new democratic countries in Southeastern Europe are being implemented smoothly. In Bulgaria, the economic plan has shown the flourishing of the economy from the very beginning. In the first five months of this year, industrial products were more than in the same period last year. Oil extraction increased by 25 percent, coal production increased by 10 percent, salt production increased by 13 percent, and electricity output increased by 1,600 horsepower. Romania's new economic plan will be implemented in stages. The first phase, concerning national finance and new regulations for industrial products, will begin on July 1st. The highest production increase plan for the next six months has also been drafted, with special emphasis on oil, coal, and metallurgy. The national institutions for industrial development will also be established in July. In Poland, the three-year economic recovery plan has been approved by the parliament. The plan will carry out large-scale land reform and relocate more than 200,000 farmers to the western regions. The three-year plan guarantees the rapid recovery and development of Polish agriculture. Rye production will double in two years, wheat will increase by two and a half times, and potatoes and sugar beets will increase by 50 percent. The production of Polish agricultural machinery reached the pre-war level last year, and will be almost double the pre-war level in three years. New York Nation magazine reporter Penrose wrote an article in Vienna praising the economic development of the new democratic countries in Southeastern Europe, pointing out that: without American aid, the recovery of Southeastern Europe can still continue; if the United States believes that the new governments of these countries will modify their policies in order to obtain US dollars, it will be completely wrong.

    【新华社陕北十日电】据各方讯：东南欧新民主主义国家的经济计划，已在顺利实施中，在保加利亚，经济计划的工作一开始就显示着经济状态的兴旺；今年五个月内工业产品较去年同一时期为多，石油的提取增加百分之二十五，煤炭增产百分之十，盐产增加百分之十三，电力增出一千六百匹马力。罗马尼亚的新经济计划，将分期执行，第一期关于国家财政及对工业出品之新管制，长于七月一日开始，未来六个月中之最高增产计划亦已拟就，其中特别重视石油、煤矿及冶金。关于工业发展之国家机构，亦将于七月内成立。在波兰，经济复兴三年计划已经国会通过，该计划将进行大规模的土地改革，并将迁移二十万以上的农民往西部地区；三年计划保证了波兰农业的迅速恢复与发展，两年内黑麦产量增至两倍，小麦增加两倍半，洋芋与甜菜将增产百分之五十，波兰农业机械的生产于去年即达战前水准，三年内将几近战前水准的一倍。纽约民族杂志记者潘洛斯在维也纳撰文赞述东南欧新民主主义国家的经济发展，指出：没有美国的援助，东南欧之恢复仍能继续进行；如果美国认为这些国家的新政府为取得美元而将修改其政策，则将大错而特错。
