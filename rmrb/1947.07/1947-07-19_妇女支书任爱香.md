    Women's Branch Secretary Ren Aixiang
    I. Relying on Others is Useless
    Wang Zhounan
    In Nanguan, Cixian County, there was a woman named Ren Aixiang. Her family of four cultivated two mu of sandy land. Even their house was mortgaged from someone else. Although her father ran around trying to make a living, they inevitably faced days of empty pots and no rice. Sometimes, seeing others eating, they would close their door and lie on the kang (heated brick bed), forcing themselves to endure the hunger. Later, unable to bear it any longer, her father suddenly found a “good way out,” saying they could live a good life by joining the Catholic Church. Hearing that she might not have to starve, Ren Aixiang naturally agreed. But after joining the church, not only was there still no rice in the pot, but they were constantly praying or attending Mass, leaving no time to even catch a meal. Seeing that relying on the church was unreliable, Ren Aixiang thought she should find another way. Later, she became sworn sisters with the daughter of a small landlord, Yu Ziliang. Ren Aixiang thought, "Now I've latched onto a powerful leg." However, after the swearing of sisterhood, the "sister" never visited her home, but seemed very close. For example, when the cotton in Yu Ziliang's field was ripe, or when it was time to change clothes in the autumn or summer, she would send her daughter to find Aixiang, saying, "Sister? Please pick cotton for me for a few days!" or "Sister! Please wash clothes for me for a couple of days!" But when the cotton was picked and the clothes were worn, Yu Ziliang would say to his daughter, "Your sister has been staying at our house for quite a while. Your godfather is too busy alone at home. Tell your sister to go back!" As for wages, Yu Ziliang didn't offer any, and Ren Aixiang was naturally too embarrassed to ask. So Ren Aixiang dejectedly returned home, opened the pot lid, and a gust of cold air rushed towards her, causing her to sigh, "Alas! Relying on others is useless!"

            II. Became Famous From Then On
    After the liberation of Cixian County, the democratic government distributed relief grain. Ren Aixiang also received four dou (a unit of dry measure) and carried it home. From then on, she always thought, "The Communist Party is really strange! I used to beg people everywhere, and even my sworn sister wouldn't lend me one dou of grain. But after the Communist Party came, they gave me four dou without a word. I really don't know what the Communist Party is thinking?" Although she hadn't met any members of the Communist Party, she felt closer to the Communist Party than her own family. Whenever she heard someone say something bad about the Communist Party, she felt worse than if they had insulted her father.
    Soon, the village organized a peasant association to carry out land reform. The big special agent Shen Jixian took advantage of the opportunity to become the head of the peasant association and conducted a fake struggle. Ren Aixiang quietly said to her father, "Dad! Let's also organize a peasant association! That cruel fellow won't come to a good end." Then, she reported the situation to the higher authorities to dissolve Shen Jixian's fake peasant association, and at the same time, colluded with and organized an eight-person land reform group. At that time, because the masses were not yet aware, she first struggled against people from outside the village. Slowly, after her day and night persuasions, the peasant association expanded to forty people. She led everyone to struggle against the big landlord Fan Laoti, the big traitor Shen Jixian, and the puppet Baozhang (village head) Zhang Enyun for nine times in four consecutive days. The masses began to stand up, and from then on, Ren Aixiang became famous. Whenever someone had a problem, they would look for Ren Aixiang: "Please handle this for me!" Whenever cadres had disagreements, they would look for Ren Aixiang: "Please say a word!" In short, no matter how big the matter, as long as Ren Aixiang was present, one word would solve it.
    Since Ren Aixiang handled matters for the masses, the masses respected her, and the Communist Party also valued her. In September, the Communist Party District Committee Secretary went to talk to her and introduced her to the Party. Upon hearing this, she felt that the long-awaited Communist Party was right in front of her, and that she was about to become a Communist Party member. She was so happy that she said, "Join, join, join! I've had this in mind for a long time, but I couldn't find the door." From then on, she joined the Communist Party. Soon, a branch was established in the village, and she was elected as the branch secretary. Ren Aixiang became the leader of the people of Nanguan.

            III. Mobilized Her Husband to Join the Army, Put Down Her Child to Fight the Drought
    After Ren Aixiang became the branch secretary, everyone's eyes were on her. Last October, when the enemy attacked the liberated areas, special agents spread rumors, causing panic. Ren Aixiang convened a mass meeting and announced a pledge: "I vow to oppose the Kuomintang army to the death, and resolutely lead everyone to fight to the end!" This reassured the masses, and their morale immediately rose. Then, under her leadership, they proposed the slogan: "Hold a gun in one hand and carry out land reform in the other, ensuring both combat readiness and struggle," and launched a mass parade struggle against the special agents Wang Wuting and Du Yueqin. The enthusiasm of the masses was unprecedented.
    In March of this year, Chiang Kai-shek attacked Yan'an! The higher authorities called for: "Defending the land, defending Chairman Mao, and conducting a large-scale expansion of the army." Ren Aixiang returned home and immediately mobilized her husband to join the army. Her husband was initially reluctant, but she said, "Think about who gave us the house, who gave us the land. Would you like the enemy to take it away?" Her husband understood, and she went to the branch meeting to mobilize everyone. Seeing that she herself was setting an example, no one wanted to lag behind, and immediately seven or eight Party members signed up. After the Party members mobilized the masses, sixty heroes went to the front line. In this conscription, Nanguan became a model.
    In May, the higher authorities called for drought resistance and planting seeds with water. At that time, the masses thought, "If God doesn't send rain, nothing can be done." Seeing that she had to take action herself, Ren Aixiang put her five-month-old nursing child at home, picked up a dipper and a bucket, and went to the fields herself. Seeing that Ren Aixiang had gone to the fields, the men and women of Nanguan became busy. Those who found dippers found dippers, those who borrowed carrying poles borrowed carrying poles, and they immediately organized more than 220 male and female laborers, planting 500 mu of cotton in three days. When the district summarized production, Nanguan was again a model.
    The masses love Ren Aixiang, listen to her, and follow her. Ren Aixiang's name is being spread everywhere among the masses, who regard her as their glory.

    妇女支书任爱香
    一、靠谁也不中用
    王周南
    磁县南关有个妇女任爱香，一家四口人种着二亩沙滩地，房子还是典的人家的，虽然父亲东奔西跑，但究竟免不了滚着锅子没米下，有时看人家吃饭了，便上起门来，全家躺在炕上硬将这顿饥饿忍下去。后来实在忍不下去了，父亲忽然不知道那里找到个好门路，说是在了天主教就能过好时光。任爱香一听还能不挨饿，自然愿意在，但在教后，不但锅里该没米还是没米，反而三天两头，不是祈祷就是做礼拜，连个赶嘴的功夫都没有了。任爱香一看在教有靠不住，便想还是另打主意吧！后来算是跟一个小地主俞子良的女儿拜了干姐妹，任爱香想：“这可捧住粗腿了。”可是结拜后，干妹妹虽然没来她家走过亲，看来倒也很亲热，比方俞子良的地里棉花熟了，或是秋头夏季要换衣服了，就使他的女儿来找爱香说：“姐姐？给俺摘两天花吧！”或是“姐姐！给俺两天衣裳吧！”但等到花摘完了，衣裳穿上身了，俞子良就对他的女儿说“你姐姐在咱家住的日期不少了，光你干爹一个人在家也忙不过来，叫你姐姐回去吧！”至于工钱呢，俞子良不说给，任爱香当然也不好意思要，于是任爱香松不拉的回到家里，揭开锅盖一看，一股冷气扑面冲来，便不觉叹息说：“唉！靠谁也不中用！”
            二、从此出了名
    磁县解放后，民主政府发放救济粮，任爱香也去领了四斗背回家，从此她心里便一直想：“共产党真奇怪！以前我到处求人，连结拜姐妹也不借给我一斗粮食，共产党来了没吭一声就给了我四斗，真不知道共产党是个啥心思？”可是这以后，她虽然没有见过共产党，但她心里对共产党就比一家人还要亲，只要听谁说一声共产党不好，就觉得比骂她爹还难受。
    不久，村里便组织农会闹翻身，大特务申继先钻空子当了农会长，进行假斗争，任爱香便悄悄对她父亲说：“爹！咱也组织农会吧！那狠吃弄不出好下场。”当下，她便一面给上级反映情况，解散申继先的假农会，一面串通组织了八个人的翻身小组。当时因群众还未觉悟，她便先从外边（外村）往里（本村）斗。慢慢经过她白天说，黑夜劝，农会扩大到四十人，她便领导大家一连四天斗了九次，将大地主范老体，大汉奸申继先，伪保长张恩云斗倒了。群众开始翻了身，从此任爱香也就出了名，只要谁家出了问题了，便找任爱香：“你给俺处理处理吧！”干部谁闹意见了便找任爱香：“你说一句话吧！”总之，那怕天大的事，只要任爱香到场，一说就了。
    自从任爱香给群众办了事，群众看起她，共产党也就看起她。九月间共产党区委书记便去找她谈话，介绍她入党。她猛一听觉得好久盼望的共产党就在她眼前，并且觉得自己马上就要成为共产党员了，高兴得她真是了不得，连忙说：“入，入，入！我早就有这个心思了，就是找不着这个门。”从此她就参加了共产党，不久村里成立起支部，她被选为支部书记，任爱香便成为南关人民的领袖了。
            三、动员丈夫去参军，放下孩子搞抗旱
    任爱香担任支部书记后，大家两眼便都看着她。去年十月间敌人进攻解放区，特务造谣，人心惶惶，任爱香便召开群众大会，宣布誓言：“我誓死反对遭殃军，坚决领导大家斗到底！”这一下群众好象吃了定心丸，情绪马上高起来，随即在她领导下提出：“一手拿枪，一手清算，备战斗争两不误”的口号，展开了对特务王五庭、杜月琴的游行大斗争，群众情绪空前的活跃了起来。
    今年三月间，蒋介石进攻延安啦！上级号召：“保卫土地、保卫毛主席，要进行大扩军。”任爱香回到家里立即动员她男人去参军。她男人开始有点不愿去，她说：“你想想房是谁给的，地是谁给的，你愿意叫敌人要了吗？”她男人想通了，她便到支部会上做动员，大家一看她自己起模范，谁还肯落后，马上七八名党员报了名；党员对群众一活动，就有六十名好汉上前线，这次参军，南关成了模范。
    五月间，上级号召抗旱备荒，担水点种，当时群众思想是“老天爷不下雨，怎也不行。”任爱香一看自己不下手不行，她便把五个月的吃奶孩子放到家里，拿起杓，担起桶，亲自下地。大家一看任爱香下地了，南关的男女们便都忙碌起来，找杓的找杓，借担的借担，马上组织起男女劳力二百二十余名，三天点种棉花五百亩。区上总结生产的时候，南关又是模范。
    群众热爱任爱香，听她话，跟她走。任爱香的名子，在群众中到处被传颂着，把她当作自己的光荣。
