Visiting General Zhao Shoushan

General Zhao Shoushan, who was transferred by Chiang Kai-shek from the Thirty-eighth Army he had personally trained to become the Commander-in-Chief of the Third Army Group, escaped the surveillance of secret agents and broke through the blockade of the Chiang army after several twists and turns from Nanjing and Shanghai, which were under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary group, and has arrived in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Area. Our reporter recently visited General Zhao at the headquarters of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army's Thirty-eighth Army.

General Zhao is fifty-four years old, tall and strong, with a long face and sharp eyes. His hair is slightly gray, but his face is ruddy, he is humorous and talkative, and retains the lively and vigorous spirit of a young man.

General Zhao told the reporter that his entry into the liberated area was not accidental. He shared hardships with General Yang Hucheng for more than twenty years, serving as regimental, brigade, and division commander. He participated in confidential matters during the Xi'an Incident. At the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he led the Thirty-eighth Army in the Zhongtiao Mountain resistance, transforming the troops and carrying out mass mobilization work. However, Chiang Kai-shek believed that they were the "root of disaster" left over from the Xi'an Incident, so their hatred, persecution, and division were endless, suffering more vicious treatment than other so-called "miscellaneous" troops. General Zhao lamented that he was a "training expert," because Chiang Kai-shek said he had ideological problems. During the War of Resistance alone, he was sent to Chongqing for training three times. His transfer to Gansu occurred during his second training session at the "Central Training Corps," when Chiang Kai-shek pre-ordered his confidant Zhang Yaoming to take over the troops, seizing the real power of the Thirty-eighth Army, and transferred Zhao himself to Liangzhou, Gansu, as a "bare commander." At that time, his headquarters staff were mostly Chiang Kai-shek's henchmen, and the subordinate units were Hu Zongnan's army. He had no choice but to read books, write, and use badminton to pass the time.

After the Japanese surrender, Mao Zedong's visit to Chongqing and the convening of the Political Consultative Conference, General Zhao had great hopes for domestic peace and democracy. Unexpectedly, after the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, Chiang Kai-shek tore up all agreements and decided to fight a civil war. Chiang Kai-shek personally went to Xi'an at the end of April last year to deploy the civil war and summoned General Zhao to express his attitude. He was very angry and heartbroken at the time, and asked to go abroad for investigation on the grounds that he was too old to lead troops again. In July, Chiang Kai-shek began to fight on a large scale throughout the country, and just at this time, his order to go to the United States to investigate water conservancy also came down. "I don't think I can go to the United States," General Zhao said, "American imperialism is helping Chiang's civil war, and I would have to receive Chiang Kai-shek's blood money extorted from the people, go to the United States to enjoy my life, and escape reality, which is shameful." He recalled the scene of anti-civil war during the December 12th incident, and hated Chiang Kai-shek who after ten years was still a dog that eats feces, not forgetting the road of eating feces. He felt that the people of the motherland were suffering deeply, and General Yang Hucheng's unjust imprisonment had not been redressed, and he could not be without responsibility, so he decided to seek to join the troops that had revolted from the Thirty-eighth Army at the risk of danger, and to strive for the independence, peace and democracy of the whole of China with practical actions.

General Zhao, based on the concrete facts he witnessed in his jurisdiction of rural bankruptcy, industrial and commercial collapse, food panic, popular uprisings, workers' strikes, and large-scale student movements caused by the civil war, explained that "the rule of the Chiang government is becoming increasingly unstable, and Chiang Kai-shek's failure is not far away." General Zhao fully agrees with the political consultative conference line and the establishment of a coalition government. He hopes that the progressive elements in the Chinese middle factions and all the "miscellaneous" troops who are suffering oppression will break any illusions about Chiang Kai-shek, firmly stand on the side of the people, carry out practical struggles, and strive for an independent, democratic, and peaceful New China as soon as possible.

Although General Zhao Shoushan has not been in the liberated area for many days, he has read many books and highly praises Chairman Mao's works. In addition to reading, he likes to talk about problems with people around him and understand the situation in all aspects. He expressed great satisfaction with the land reform in the liberated area, which truly implemented Mr. Sun Yat-sen's proposition of "the tillers have their land." He said, "The new society I have dreamed of for decades has become a reality in the liberated area."

    访赵寿山将军
    曾被蒋介石调离开自己一手训练的三十八军去当第三集团军总司令的赵寿山将军，由国民党反动集团统治下的南京、上海，几经曲折，逃出了特务的监视，冲破了蒋军的封锁线，已辗转抵达晋冀鲁豫解放区。记者特于日前趋赴西北民主联军三十八军司令部访晤赵将军。
    赵将军现年五十四岁，身体高挺而强健，长长的面颊，眼神锐利，头发略现斑白，但满脸红光，诙谐健谈，保有青年人活泼旺盛的精神。
    赵将军对记者表示：他的进入解放区不是偶然的。他与杨虎城将军共患难二十多年，历任团、旅、师长等职，双十二事变曾参与机密事宜。抗战开始，率领三十八军在中条山抗战，改造部队，开展民运工作，但是蒋介石认为他们是西安事变留下来的“祸根子”，因此对他们的仇视、迫害、分化，层出不穷。比别的所谓“杂牌”部队受着更加恶毒的待遇。赵将军感慨的自称他是“受训专家”，因为蒋介石说他个人思想有问题，仅在抗战期间，就被调到重庆受过三次训，他的被调赴甘肃，就是在二次受训于“中训团”期内，蒋介石预令他的心腹张耀明到部队接事，攫夺了三十八军的实权，而把赵氏本人调到甘肃凉州当“光杆”总司令，那时他的总部人员，大都是安置好了的蒋介石的爪牙，下属编制是胡宗南的军队，他只好每天看看书，写写字，并以板羽球运动来消遣。
    日寇投降后，毛主席赴渝和政协会议的召开，赵将军对国内和平民主曾抱着很大的希望。不料蒋介石于国民党二中全会后，即撕毁一切协议，决心打内战，蒋介石并于去年四月底亲到西安布置内战，并将赵将军召回，要他表示态度，他当时很气愤痛心，便以年纪老了，不能再带兵为辞，要求出国考察。七月蒋介石开始在全国各地大打，恰在此时他被派到美国考察水利的命令也下来了。“我觉得不能到美国去”，赵将军说：“美帝国主义助蒋内战，还要支领蒋介石由人民剥夺而来的血汗钱，到美国去逍遥岁月，逃避现实，是可耻的。”他回忆起双十二反内战的一幕，痛恨蒋介石在十年之后，仍然是吃屎的狗，不忘吃屎的路。他觉得祖国人民深罹苦难，杨虎城将军冤狱未复，自己是不能没有责任的，于是决心不避难险，寻求与三十八军起义过来的部队会合，要以实际的行动争取全中国的独立和平与民主。
    赵将军以目睹之将管区因内战而形成的农村破产，工商倒闭，粮食恐慌，民变蜂起，工人罢工，大规模的学生运动等具体事实，说明“蒋政府的统治日趋不稳，蒋介石的失败已为期不远了。”赵将军完全赞同政协路线，成立联合政府，他希望中国中间派进步人士，和一切痛受压迫的“杂牌”军，打破对蒋介石的任何幻想，坚决地站到人民方面，作实际斗争，早日争出一个独立、民主、和平的新中国来。
    赵寿山将军到解放区虽然日子不多，已经看了好多书，对毛主席的著作备加推崇。他读书之外，喜欢和左右谈问题，了解各方面的情况。他对于解放区的土地改革，真正实行了孙中山先生“耕者有其田”的主张，表示十分欣慰，他说：“我几十年来梦想的新社会，在解放区已变成现实了。”
