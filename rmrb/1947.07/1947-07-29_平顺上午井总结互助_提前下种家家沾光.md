　　Ping Shun Shang Wu Jing Sums Up Mutual Aid
  　Early Planting Benefits Every Household
    [This newspaper's Ping Shun dispatch] Li Buqi mutual aid group of Shang Wu Jing in the first district, in order to further consolidate the mutual aid organization and ensure that everyone benefits, convened all the laborers of the group on the night of the 19th of this month to summarize the production achievements from the first month of the lunar calendar to the present. In the mutual discussion, Zhai Erze said: "I didn't harvest much grain last year because I bought a livestock that needed more than a liter of feed a day. By March of this year, I ran out of grain. With the mutual help and friendship of the whole group, I borrowed five dou of millet, and with the one shi of wheat I harvested in the summer, it was enough for my family of four to eat. This is my first joy. My child joined the army in northern Henan this spring, and the whole group lent me 3,000 yuan for travel expenses, so I didn't have to sell grain. This is my second joy. Because I am old and cannot cultivate the land, and my child left to join the army, they were able to plant the seeds early for me, and the seedlings are growing very well. This is my third joy." After mutual review, the unanimous opinion was: this year, without waiting for rain, the whole group planted early, and the seedlings are first-class in the whole village. This is a major advantage. During planting, two surplus semi-laborers were assigned to drive two donkeys for transportation, earning 17,000 yuan, ensuring that every household had coal to burn and salt to eat. In addition to cultivating their own land well, the laborers at home also helped other groups cultivate more than ten mu of land, earning more than 170 jin of rice, which was divided equally according to the labor and livestock strength of the whole group. After the summary, everyone believed that mutual aid brings benefits, while separation leads to injury. If it weren't for the group leader's tight grip and frequent discussions, waiting for the rain to plant would have been a complete disaster. Currently, the whole group has fifty mu of autumn land and seven mu of cotton. The autumn land has been hoed twice, and during the second hoeing, the slogan of applying additional fertilizer was put forward, aiming for "three empties": 1. Empty the outhouses, 2. Empty the livestock pens, 3. Empty the manure piles. Not a bit of fertilizer is allowed to be left at home. More than five mu have already been fertilized. The cotton has been hoed five times. Based on this situation, a ten-day plan has been formulated for the future: 1. The whole group's autumn land must be hoed a third time within ten days, and the cotton hoed seven times, removing all dodder and dodder seeds. 2. Two semi-laborers and four livestock will be assigned to transportation, transporting goods from Weizi Town to Zhangjing, twice in ten days, with a planned profit of 10,000 yuan.

　　平顺上午井总结互助
  　提前下种家家沾光
    【本报平顺讯】一区上五井李不乞互助小组，为了使互助组织进一步的巩固，做到人人不吃亏，于本月十九日黑夜召集全组劳力，总结自阴历一月到现在生产成绩。在互相讨论中翟二则说：“我去年收的粮食不多，因买了个牲口一天就得一升多料吃，不到今年三月就没有了粮食，在全组互助友爱下，给我借了五斗小米，连我夏天收麦子一石就够我全家四口人吃了，这是我第一个高兴。我的孩子今春到豫北参战，全组给借了三千元盘缠，使我没有卖粮食这是第二高兴。因我年老种不了地，孩子参战走了能提前给我下种，小苗长的很好，是我三大高兴。”经互相检讨后一致意见说：今年没有等雨，全组提前下种，全村上是第一等小苗，这是一大优点。在下种时抽出两个剩余半劳力赶二个毛驴运输，赚洋一万七千元，做到了家家有煤烧，家家有盐吃。在家的劳力除种好地外还帮助别的组种地十亩多，赚米一百七十余斤，按全组人畜力分数均分。总结后大家认为互助能沾光，分散要受伤，要不是组长抓的紧，经常大家多研究，等雨再下种就糟到底了。现全组五十亩秋地、七亩棉花，秋地已全都锄了两遍，并在锄二遍时提出上追粪口号，要实行三光：１、毛坑光，２、牲口圈光，３、粪堆光。家里不叫留一点粪，已上追粪五亩多。棉花已锄了五遍。依此情况订出了今后十天的计划：１、全组秋地十天内要锄到三遍，棉花锄到七遍，猫耳、油条打净。２、抽出两个半劳力、四个畜力搞运输，从微子镇运到张井，十天运两次，计划赚洋一万元。
