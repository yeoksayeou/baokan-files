    Can't afford to eat, can't afford to eat;
    Can't afford to wear clothes, can't afford to wear clothes;
    Can't afford to take a car, can't afford to take a car;
    Can't afford to rent a house, can't afford to rent a house;
    Can't afford to raise children, can't afford to raise children;
    When someone dies, can't afford to buy a coffin;
    It's hard to live in the countryside, can't afford to live in the city.
    Can't live, can't live!
    Half of the salary is deducted for advance payment,
    Half of the salary is paid back to Lao Li,
    The remaining change is brought home,
    To sell kerosene or buy rice? No.

    活弗起
    要吃饭，吃弗起；
    要穿衣，穿弗起；
    要坐车，坐弗起；
    要租房子，租弗起；
    养下孩子，养弗起；
    死了人，棺材买弗起；
    乡下难过活，城里住弗起。
    活弗起呀，活弗起！
    一半薪水扣预支，
    一半薪水还老李，
    剩下零头带家里，
    去卖洋油还是去买米？弗，（沪语不）
