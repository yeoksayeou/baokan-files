Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 13th: A certain unit of the Suzhong People's Liberation Army advanced into the heartland of the Chiang-occupied area and, on the 8th, captured the important stronghold of Sanyu Town in eastern Nantong in one fell swoop. All the defending enemies were wiped out. A total of 200 enemy soldiers were captured, including a deputy battalion commander of the Chiang-controlled Nantong Security Team (including six members of the Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of National Defense Service Corps), and over 100 enemy soldiers, including the Chiang-controlled district chief, were killed or wounded. Twelve light and heavy machine guns and 205 rifles and pistols were seized. This victory reconnected large areas of eastern Tong (Nantong) and eastern Ru (Rugao), and disrupted the Chiang army's offensive deployment against the Tong (Nantong) Hai (men) area.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 13th: A unit of local armed forces in the northern Jiangsu Huaihai area launched a simultaneous attack on more than ten villages in the 400-square-mile area twelve miles north of Shuyang city on the evening of the 29th of last month, wiping out one Chiang-controlled district office and four township offices within one hour. 222 Chiang-controlled officials and soldiers including the district chief, were captured. When the Chiang prisoners were escorted to the central area, the masses along the way beat gongs and drums and enthusiastically supported the army.
