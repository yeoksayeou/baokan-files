[Reported by this newspaper from the Jiluyu area on the 20th] Simultaneously with our counter-offensive army recovering Dingtao, the Ran Yu and Huangdian districts of Dingtao County convened a farmers' meeting of 25,000 people to resolutely implement the re-examination of land distribution. When the People's Liberation Army marched into Henan, 17,000 farmers, women, and children from Ran Yu Village, carrying red-tasseled spears and small flags, went to Naozhuang to hold a farmers' meeting. First, they commemorated the martyred heroes. More than 250 despotic landlords wore sackcloth and mourned, performing the five-kowtow ritual to the dead martyrs, and the emotions of the masses were filled with grief and indignation. After a public trial by all the farmers, three landlords who were murderers were shot. During group discussions, everyone believed that the landlords still had a lot of possessions, and many farmers were not yet organized. The ineffectual peasant association chairman was immediately re-elected, and replaced by model and active members from the land reform. In Weilu Village, the re-examination plan was discussed, and Xun Village proposed that landlords should have their houses changed within three days. After the masses shared their grievances, they collectively swore an oath to resolutely carry it through to the end. The Lindian district held a farmers' meeting of more than 8,000 people. During group discussions, each village felt that their emancipation was not thorough enough, and Chuanlou in the Donghuang district proposed returning to the village to immediately conduct a re-examination, followed by enthusiastic challenges from various sub-districts.

　　与南下大军收复定陶同时
  　定陶两万农民集会追悼烈士公审奸霸
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】与我反攻大军收复定陶同时，定陶县冉峪、黄店两区召开二万五千人的农民大会，坚决贯彻复查。当人民解放军向河南挺进时，冉峪村一万七千农民妇女儿童扛着红缨枪拿着小旗，到闹庄开农民大会，首先追悼被难烈士，二百五十多个奸霸地主披麻带孝，向死难烈士行五叩大礼，群情悲愤。经全体农民公审，枪毙杀人凶犯地主三名。分组讨论时，大家都认为地主东西仍很多，农民还有很多未组织起来，当场把不起作用的农会长改选，由土地改革中的模范和积极分子接任。维略各村讨论复查计划，薰庄提出三天内，地主换完房子。群众诉苦后，集体盟誓，坚决干到底。林店区召开八千多人的农民大会，分组讨论时，各村认为自己翻身还不彻底，东黄区传楼提出回村马上复查，接着各小区热烈挑战。
