Demand the lives of murderers, demand the debt of land!
　　Thousands of people in Qinghe Town fight "compiled villages"
　　[This newspaper's Taiyue 19th dispatch] Over a thousand farmers in Qinghe Town, Jishan County, broke through ideological concerns to seek revenge against the main culprits of "compiled villages" such as Zhang Yongfu. Qinghe Town is the second largest town in the county, with 536 households and over 2,000 people. Before liberation, the area had already been impoverished by the relentless exploitation of the Japanese puppets, Chiang Kai-shek, Yan Xishan, etc. The village government was controlled by the "Rich People's Association" organized by local bullies Shi Yizhai and Shi Danqing. The burden of the village was shifted onto middle peasants and those below. In addition, there were various Kuomintang special agent organizations, forming a solid reactionary group that slaughtered and plundered the peasants. "Compiled Village Chief" Zhang Yongfu, since 1943, on the pretext of political issues, buried alive five poor peasants including Shi Sanyuan and Feng Zhuzi, seized more than ten livestock from Feng Ziwa and Feng Yinlong, beat peasant Shi to death for no reason, and raped women in Qinjia Village. The bullies Shi Yizhai and Shi Danqing committed similar atrocities. In 1941, when the Fen'nan Anti-Japanese government arrived in the town, Shi Yizhai and Shi Danqing bribed nineteen landlords and rich peasants to organize the "Rich People's Association" to resist. At the same time, they used this as an excuse to exploit the people, making it impossible for more than 300 poor peasants to live. After the liberation of Jishan, when the work team arrived in the village, Shi Yizhai fled in fear of punishment. The "Rich People's Association", secretly presided over by Shi Danqing, made every effort to sabotage the mass movement. At that time, the democratic government called for the rapid completion of the summer tax collection. Zhang Yongfu, Shi Danqing, and others took the opportunity to use a diversionary tactic to disperse the masses, pretending to support the democratic government, and said to everyone: "It is important to send public grain to our government. Let more people go, and it will be finished in one go." However, this was immediately seen through by the masses. A mass meeting was held to expose the landlords' conspiracy, and it was decided that the poor would not deliver grain this time, but let the landlords and rich peasants transport it with mules and carts. When manpower and animal power were insufficient, wealthy middle peasants would be dispatched. From then on, the masses' enthusiasm soared, and they hated the landlords and bullies even more. The struggle quickly matured, and Zhang Yongfu, Shi Danqing, and other bully landlords were first arrested. Starting on June 15th, five grievance-airing and revenge meetings were held in a row. The wife of the murdered Feng Sanyuan rushed out of the crowd, wailing, pointed at Zhang Yongfu and said: "You were the compiled village chief, and buried my man alive for no reason, leaving me with no land to cultivate and no food to eat." She raised her hand and hit him. Peasant Yan Yinshuo held a long stick in his right hand, twisted Zhang's ear with his left hand, and asked: "When you were alive, there was no way for us poor people to live. My brother Jinshuo said a bad word about Yan Xishan, and you dragged him outside the village and beat him to death. Today, tell me, shouldn't we avenge this?" When Ji Yibei's wife recounted the story of Shi Danqing's murder of her husband, she rushed forward and bit him.
　　Countless suffering people demanded the lives of Zhang Yongfu, Shi Danqing, Jia Hai, and other culprits, demanding the debt of land. A fierce flame of revenge was ignited throughout the venue. The government announced on the spot the confiscation of land and property of Zhang Yongfu, Shi Danqing, Shi Yizhai, and others, and Zhang Yongfu was executed by firing squad. The masses all showed victorious smiles. Then, another mass meeting was held to give face-washing to those who had served as "compiled village" group leaders and head of the village under Yan Xishan.

　　向凶犯要人命债，要土地债！
  　清河镇千人斗“编村”
    【本报太岳十九日电】稷山清河镇千余农民打破思想顾虑向“编村”祸首张永福等复仇雪恨。清河镇为全县第二大镇有五百三十六户，两千余人口。解放前，该地已在日伪蒋阎等百般压榨下，人穷财空，村政权为恶霸史益斋、史丹卿等组织之“富人会”所掌握，村里负担转嫁在中农以下的农民身上。此外又有蒋家多种特务组织，形成坚固的反动集团，残杀与搜刮农民。“编村村长”张永福，曾于卅二年起借口政治问题活埋了贫农史三元、冯柱子等五人，抢去冯子娃，冯因龙等十余头牲口，无故将农民史某打死，并在秦家庄强奸妇女。奸霸史益斋、史丹卿同样行凶。卅年，汾南抗日政权到达该镇时，史益斋与史丹卿收买十九家地主与富农，组织“富人会”抵制。同时借此盘剥，使三百余户贫苦农民更无法生活。稷山解放后，工作队到达该村，史益斋畏罪逃躲，“富人会”在史丹卿秘密主持下，全力破坏群众运动。当时民主政府号召迅速完成夏屯，张永福、史丹卿等便乘机用调虎离山计，分散群众，装着拥护民主政府的样子，对大家说：“还是给咱政府送公粮要紧，多去些人，一次就送完了”。但是立即被群众识破，召开大会，揭穿地主阴谋，并决定此次送粮穷人不去，让地主富农的骡马大车运送，人力畜力不足时，再派富裕中农。从此群众情绪高涨，对地主奸霸更加仇恨，斗争迅速酝酿成熟，首将张永福、史丹卿等奸霸地主扣起。自六月十五日开始，连开五次诉苦复仇大会，被害的冯三元女人嚎啕大哭的从人群中扑出，指着张永福说：“你当编村长，无缘无故的把我男人活埋了，害的我地没人种，人没饭吃。”说着举手就打。农民阎银锁右手握着长棍，左手扭着张逆的耳朵，问：“你在世就没有我们穷人的活路，我兄弟金锁说了一句阎锡山的坏话，你就把他拉到村外打死，今天你说该不该报这个仇？”吉乙备的女人诉到史丹卿谋害他丈夫的经过时，扑上前去，咬了一口。
    无数的苦人向张永福，史丹卿贾孩等祸首要人命债，要土地债，全场燃起了激烈的复仇火焰。当场政府宣布没收张永福，史丹卿，史益斋等土地与家产，并枪毙了张永福，群众个个现出胜利的笑容。接着又召开大会，给曾当过阎顽“编村”组长闾长的人洗脸擦黑。
