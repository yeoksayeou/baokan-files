Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th – The Political Department of the Liaodong Military Region recently issued an order to troops to protect land reform. The order instructs cadres at all levels to study land reform documents thoroughly, conduct rigorous ideological self-reflection, and extensively promote the "speak bitterness" movement among soldiers to thoroughly eliminate feudal forces. Those who individually harbor evil landlord elements should face sharp struggle, forcing them to publicly apologize and admit their mistakes to the masses. Alien elements who have infiltrated our army in an attempt to escape reckoning should be immediately purged and handed over to the masses for handling. All units should restore the glorious tradition of propaganda work while entering and exiting villages, establish civilian affairs groups at the company level, conduct land reform in peacetime, and be responsible for war support work in wartime.

  　保护土地改革
    【新华社东北二十四日电】辽东军区政治部，顷颁布保护土地改革训令，指示各级干部普遍学习土地改革文件，严格进行思想反省，在战士中广泛开展诉苦运动，贯彻消灭封建势力。对个别庇护恶霸地主分子，应展开尖锐斗争，使其公开向群众赔罪认错；对混入我军企图逃避清算之异已分子，应立即洗刷，交给群众处理。各部队应恢复进出宣传的光荣传统，以连队为单位设立民运组，平时进行土地改革，战时负责战勤工作。
