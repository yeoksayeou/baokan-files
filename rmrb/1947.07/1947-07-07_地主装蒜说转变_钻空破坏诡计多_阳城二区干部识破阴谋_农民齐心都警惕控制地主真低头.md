Landlords Feign Transformation, Exploit Loopholes and Engage in Sabotage
  Cadres in Yangcheng Second District See Through the Conspiracy
  Peasants Unite and Vigilantly Control Landlords, Who Truly Lower Their Heads
  [Our Yangcheng Dispatch] At a meeting of village cadres in the Second District of Yangcheng, everyone shared facts about how some landlords and local bullies were using various means to sabotage work. Some targets of struggle displayed false enthusiasm after being struggled against, joining mutual aid teams for production or helping with village work, using this method to paralyze the masses and deceive village cadres. Village cadres mistakenly believed that the targets of struggle had transformed, so they absorbed them into production as managers or into other work, resulting in the landlords having loopholes to exploit and opportunities to sabotage. In × village of the Second District, a target of struggle was allowed to participate in the land measurement committee. When measuring land under the name of a cadre, the target of struggle intentionally calculated five mu of land as four mu. The cadre then thought the person was treating him well. Conversely, the target of struggle secretly said to the masses, "We wouldn't dare say anything about the cadre measuring his land short." The masses, upon hearing this, believed that the cadre was selfish and dissatisfied with the cadre, with some even proposing to struggle against the cadre. The target of struggle then mediated, saying, "Who can be without a momentary mistake?" acting as a two-faced good guy to sow discord between our cadres and the masses. A target of struggle in Gushan participated in a mutual aid team. When planting millet, he didn't leave any space between the plants (knowing full well he should have). As a result, when the seedlings emerged, there weren't enough. When asked about it, he pretended not to know. Xiao Meng, a family member of a soldier in Jianghe Village, asked the target of struggle, Yang ××, to write a letter to her husband. The person then fabricated a large piece to sabotage, writing, "Zhang ××: You are gallivanting in three counties, and your little servant dares not speak at home. You are eating pork outside, and your little servant is eating bran and dark vegetables at home. Bribing and demanding payment is really unbearable, and your little servant cannot hold her head high at home." He used these lies to shake the soldiers' thinking, making them uneasy at the front. The son of a target of struggle in Kuangshan Village joined the army and felt like he had power. He raised cattle with the basic masses. When a calf was born, he wouldn't let the calf suckle after it was distributed to the peasants. When everyone reasoned with him, he hesitated. The masses couldn't reason with him, so later they used a strong approach and said to him, "What are you relying on now! If the calf dies, you will compensate with a big cow." Only then was his arrogance completely suppressed, and the whole family dared not say anything more. Since the realization of "land to the tiller," many targets of struggle have become emboldened, with some saying, "This can't struggle against me anymore." In addition, they don't participate in war, don't join the army, and don't become militiamen in the village. In some places, targets of struggle don't transform, and the mutual aid teams don't want them. They don't want to farm, so they engage in petty trade as peddlers, being very idle in the village, with high arrogance and disregard for the masses. Village cadres in the Second District of Yangcheng have already proposed at the meeting that it is necessary to closely grasp the education of peasant association members, strengthen the organization, increase vigilance, and at all times prevent the sabotage and exploitation of loopholes by the targets of struggle.

　　地主装蒜说转变  钻空破坏诡计多
  　阳城二区干部识破阴谋
    农民齐心都警惕控制地主真低头
    【本报阳城讯】阳城二区村干部会议上，大家谈出有不少地主恶霸用各种各样的手段来破坏工作的事实。有些斗争对象斗争后表现假积极，参加生产互助组，或帮助村上工作，用此办法来麻痹群众迷惑村干部，村干部误认为斗争对象转变了，就吸收斗争对象在生产中当经理及其他工作，结果使地主有空子可钻，乘隙破坏。二区×村让斗争对象参加到丈地委员会丈地，丈到干部名下时，斗争对象有意的把五亩地算成四亩，干部就以为人家对他不错，反过来斗争对象又背地里向群众说：“人家干部地丈少了咱也不敢说。”群众听了这话就认为是干部自私自利，对干部不满，有的群众甚至提出要斗争干部。斗争对象又从中调和说：“谁还能没有一时之误”。当两面好人来挑拨我干部和群众关系。孤山斗争对象参加互助组，种谷时两条腿都不留按口（他明知道）然而他留了按口，结果出来不够苗问他时，他装不知道。绛河村抗属小孟，叫斗争对象杨××给他男人写信，人家就编了一大张来进行破坏，他写是：“张××：你在外边串三县，小奴在家不敢言，你在外边吃猪肉，小奴在家吃糠咽黑菜，逼粮逼款真难受，小奴在家抬不起头。”用这些鬼话来动摇战士思想，使战士在前方不安心。矿山村斗争对象的儿子参了军，就觉着有势力了，和基本群众伙喂牛，生了小牛分给农民他不叫小牛吃奶，大家给他说理，他就支吾，群众说不住他，后来群众使用硬的方式和他说：“你又仗啥利害哩！小牛死了你用大牛赔。”这样才把他的气焰完全压下去，全家人不敢再说啥了。许多斗争对象自从实现了耕者有其田以后，胆放大了，有的就说这可斗不上我了；加之在村上不参战、不参军、不当民兵，有的地方斗争对象不转变，互助组不要他，他又不想种地，便从事担挑小贩营业，在村上很轻闲，气焰高涨，漠视群众。阳城二区村干部已在会议上提出，要抓紧教育农会会员，加强组织，提高警惕，时刻防止斗争对象的破坏和钻空子。（侯培善）
