　　[This Newspaper] According to investigations in the first, sixth, fourth, and fifth districts of En County, several hundred hectares of spring wasteland have been discovered. This land is mostly land that was struggled for after the mass movement but not promptly divided, or public land remaining from the farmers' associations. Another portion is flooded land and land belonging to fugitive households. The main reason this land has not been planted is because no one is responsible for it. For example, Liu'an Village in the fifth district has 20 hectares; Houguan Village in the fourth district has 698 mu [approximately 46.5 hectares]: including 109 mu of farmers' association land, 109 mu of land belonging to households that have left, 180 mu of land belonging to farmer members, 18 mu belonging to militia, 101 mu belonging to village cadres, 66 mu belonging to families of revolutionary soldiers, 42 mu belonging to the old and weak, 25 mu belonging to unorganized masses, and 54 mu belonging to households that were struggled against. In Muwang Village in the sixth district, due to lagging work, more than 6 hectares of land allocated to the masses are not being planted because they are afraid. Based on this, the County Party Committee emphasized that, with the spirit of being responsible for the war and responsible for the people, we must resolutely eliminate wasteland, treating it as a central link in the current production. We should rather relax some other work than fail to implement this. (Ji'nan Daily)

　　恩县发现大批荒地县委号召突击抢种
    【本报讯】恩县一、六、四、五各区调查，发现有数百顷春荒地，此种地多为群运后斗争出的土地没及时分清或农会所余之公地，另有一部水淹地及逃亡户地，该项土地并非不能种上，主要因为无人负责。如五区刘安屯二十顷；四区侯官庄六百九十八亩：其中农会地一百零九亩，外出户地一百零九亩，农会员地一百八十亩，民兵十八亩，村干一百零一亩，抗属六十六亩，老弱者四十二亩，无组织群众地二十五亩，被斗户地五十四亩。六区穆王庄因工作落后，分地群众不敢种者六顷多。据此，县委强调以为战争负责为人民负责的精神坚决消灭荒地，作为当前生产中的中心环节，宁放松其他的一些工作，也要贯彻执行。（冀南日报）
