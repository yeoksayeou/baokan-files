Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 12th: According to a United Press report from Nanjing on the 10th, the Political Consultative Conference, which had worked for China's democratic and peaceful cause, has officially ended because its secretariat was recently announced to be dissolved by the Chiang government. The Political Consultative Conference was convened in Chongqing on January 10th last year at the proposal of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to promote domestic peace and democracy, and gathered representatives from various parties and social figures. At that time, the conference reached five major agreements. However, Chiang Kai-shek then tore them up and launched a civil war and suppressed the democratic movement throughout the country. Now, as the Chiang government issues a general mobilization order for the counter-revolutionary civil war, the formal end of the remaining traces of the Political Consultative Conference - the Secretariat of the Political Consultative Conference - further exposes Chiang Kai-shek's true face of opposing the Political Consultative Conference through dictatorial, traitorous, and internal warfare.

    政协会秘书处被蒋介石解散
    【新华社陕北十二日电】据合众社南京十日消息，曾为中国民主和平事业而作过努力的政协会议，已因该会秘书处最近为蒋政府宣布解散而正式结束。按政协会议系根据中共之提议，为促成国内和平民主，于去年年一月十日集各党派及社会贤达代表在重庆召开者。当时，该会曾获得五大协议。但接着即被蒋介石撕毁，并在全国大打内战，镇压民主运动。现在，蒋政府在发布反革命内战总动员令之际宣布正式结束政协会的残留的痕迹——政协会秘书处，更暴露了蒋介石反政协的独裁卖国内战之真面目。
