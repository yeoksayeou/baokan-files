    In a Life-or-Death Situation
    Fellow Worker Zhao Dejin Doesn't Forget Those Below

    Comrade Zhao Dejin is a signalman at the Liushenggou Coal Mine. He deeply understands the importance of his responsibility at the mine entrance. Therefore, he has always been careful and cautious in his work, and no danger has ever occurred while he was on shift. On June 22nd and 24th, due to a malfunction of the hoist, water packages containing slag (about 300 kilograms) were twice lifted to the mine entrance. On the return trip, the car couldn't be held and quickly dropped into the well. Fortunately, Comrade Dejin was on duty both times. He cleverly grabbed the slag basket, dragged it to the mine entrance, supported the water package, and used all his strength to hold on, his face flushed red, his veins bulging high, and sweat streaming down. This continued until the rope of the headframe loosened and the car stopped. At that time, there were people working below the well, and the area below was only five feet in diameter. If he had let go even slightly, the water would have rushed down, definitely causing danger. Afterwards, Comrade Dejin said, "This is our responsibility. I am just one person, but there are several below." This spirit of selflessness and courage deserves great praise. He was awarded a commendation during this performance evaluation. (Han Guojun)

    生死关头
    工友赵德金不忘井下人
    赵德金同志是六盛沟煤矿一个把钩工友，他深知井口工作责任之重大，故在工作中，一贯小心谨慎，逢他上班没有出过危险。六月二十二、二十四日，因高车发生故障，曾经两次水包带碴（约三百公斤）提到井口，回时车把不住急落下井，恰碰德金同志在班，他两次均机敏的抓住碴筐，拖到井口撑住水包，用尽一切力量死不放松，满脸拘的通红，筋暴的多高，汗水直流，至天轮的绳发松车使汽迎住为止，当时井下均有人在工作，而井下面积直径又仅仅有五尺，如稍松手，水流齐下，定出危险。事后德金同志说：“这是咱的责任，咱是一个人，井下是好几个。”这种为公忘己奋不顾身的精神，值得大大表扬，这次评功时，给他记了功。（韩国俊）
