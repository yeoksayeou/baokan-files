Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, July 9th - Our correspondent reports on the situation of the Yellow River: The great flood is approaching, and Chiang Kai-shek is actively carrying out his crime of destroying the dike restoration project of the military and civilians in the liberated areas under the guise of attractive terms such as "dike restoration" and "ceasefire," waiting for the great flood to arrive so he can breach the dikes and flood the seven million residents along the river. The United Relief continues to assist Chiang in his evil deeds, making Chiang Kai-shek's ferocity even more rampant. On June 23rd, Wang Xiaoyi, the representative of the Yellow River Committee of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan liberated area, agreed with the two representatives He Lulun and Shading sent by the United Relief to negotiate dike restoration at the dam head at 3 p.m. on the 24th. The United Relief representatives not only did not send any letters after returning to the south bank of the Yellow River that day, but also detained the boats and boatmen who delivered them. The next day, the Chiang army fired guns and cannons from across the river, shouting "We'll shoot if you come over." This is what they mean by "dike restoration" and "ceasefire." In fact, after Chiang Kai-shek violated the agreement and released water, he never forgot to use the Yellow River to flood the people. They built countless strongholds on the dikes on the south bank of the Yellow River. In the Changyuan area alone, the Chiang army dug 37 communication trenches, 52 artillery bunkers, 20 machine gun bunkers, and 250 single-person bunkers on the dikes, and opened a breach, preparing for the arrival of the Yellow River. The people in the liberated areas work day and night to repair the dangerous dikes, but the Chiang army fires and bombards the dike restoration project with machine guns and cannons day and night. Enemy planes constantly patrol the dikes and bomb them indiscriminately. The Sunkou dangerous section was damaged due to the destruction of the Chiang army, causing the inner revetment of the fifth dam to be washed away by water. At that time, Zhang Fang, deputy director of the Yellow River Committee, led technicians and staff to rush to the rescue. The Chiang army took the opportunity to bombard from across the river, and the personnel were almost killed. The Chiang army stationed in the Yuncheng and Xiaopikou strongholds (now recovered by our forces) dispatched more than a thousand troops on June 6th to invade Kunshan in the north, destroying dangerous sections in the Lujia to Shilibu and Sunlou areas. In addition to looting people's grain and Yellow River repair tools, they also captured more than 200 dike restoration project personnel. On June 12th, 50,000 people in the Fourth District rushed to repair the dikes in Kunwu, Puyang, Changyuan and other places. The Chiang army in Changyuan attacked in three routes, killing and wounding more than 70 dike workers in Yujia, Shaozhai, and Jicheng. What is particularly infuriating is that Chiang's bandits, in coordination with military offensives, sent a large number of special agents to poison the wells in the villages along the dikes. According to two poison-releasing special agents captured in Xutan Village, Fourth District, Puyang, they were in a group of more than 20 people and went to the west of the dam head to release poison. Their mission was to poison the dike workers to death. All these countless crimes symbolize that Chiang Kai-shek is creating a tragic and inhuman massacre. The heroic people of Hebei-Shandong-Henan have now dispatched 300,000 workers and 30,000 carts, braving the Chiang army's artillery fire and Chiang's aircraft bombing to repair the dikes. They resolutely stated: If Chiang Kai-shek dares to use the great flood to flood the people, then all the river people will first settle accounts with Chiang Kai-shek with a desperate struggle, causing those who play with water to drown.

    蒋美假借停战掩护破坏复堤
    图待大汛淹我解放区
    冀鲁豫三十万堤工冒敌炮火全力抢修堤岸
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫九日电】本社记者报导黄河情势称：大泛将至，蒋介石正借“复堤”、“停战”等动人名词的烟幕下，积极进行其破坏解放区军民复堤工程，以待大泛一到，拔堤决口，水淹沿河七百万居民的罪行。联总继续助蒋行恶，使蒋介石凶焰更为嚣张。六月二十三日，冀鲁豫解放区黄委会代表王笑一，曾与联总派来的两名代表何乐伦、沙丁二人在坝头商妥约定二十四日下午三时会商复堤，当日联总代表回过黄河南岸，不仅渺无书信，反将送人的船只及船夫扣留。翌日，隔岸蒋军开枪打炮，高叫“过来就打”。所谓“复堤”、“停战”，不过如此。事实上蒋介石违约放水后，始终未忘怀利用黄水淹没人民，他们在黄河南岸修筑了无数的堤上据点，仅长垣一带河堤，蒋军即在堤上挖交通沟三十七道，大炮掩体五十二个，机枪掩体二十个，单人掩体二百五十处，并打开了一个缺口，准备黄水来到。解放区千万人民日夜拚命抢修险堤，蒋军却日夜以机枪大炮扫射轰击复堤工程，飞机经常巡逻河堤上空大肆轰炸，孙口险工因蒋军破坏抢修，致使第五道坝的里头埽被水冲走，当时黄委会副主任张方率领技正员工急往抢救，隔河蒋军竟趁机轰炮，人员险遭不测。驻郓城和肖皮口据点（现已为我克复）之蒋军，于六月六日出动千余名，北犯我ｋūｎ＠①山，在路家到十里堡、孙楼一带破坏险工，除抢走民粮及修黄工具外，并抓捕我复堤工程人员二百余名。六月十二日，四分区五万群众抢修昆吾、濮阳、长垣等处河堤，长垣蒋军三路出犯袭击，仅在余家、邵寨、祭城等地即杀伤堤工七十余。尤其令人发指的，是蒋贼配合军事进攻，派遣大批特务到沿堤村庄水井内放毒。据濮阳四区徐坛村捕获两名放毒特务称：彼等一批为二十余名，分赴坝头以西放毒，任务是毒毙修堤工人。这一切数不清的罪行，都象征着蒋介石正在一手制造一个惨绝人寰的大血案。英勇斗争的冀鲁豫人民，现已经出动了三十万工人，三万辆大车，冒着蒋军炮火及蒋机轰炸抢修堤岸，他们坚决的表示：如果蒋介石敢于利用大汛淹没人民，那么，全体河民将以决死斗争首先清算蒋介石，使玩水者灭顶。
