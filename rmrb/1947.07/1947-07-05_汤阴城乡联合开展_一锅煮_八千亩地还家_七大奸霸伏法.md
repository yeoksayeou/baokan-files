[Report from our newspaper in Tangyin] After the liberation of Tangyin Chengguan (urban district), impoverished citizens launched a great movement for emancipation. However, local landlords still occupied 20,000 mu of land belonging to peasants in the surrounding villages. Impoverished citizens spontaneously began to help poor fellow villagers solve the land problem, realizing that only through urban-rural unity to defeat the landlords could the root of exploitation be eradicated. Meanwhile, in the third and fourth districts west of the road, and the fifth and sixth districts east of the road, the masses in most villages were under the high rent and high-interest exploitation of landlords in Chengguan, and they were also widely brewing a desire to "go to the city to settle accounts." Some of these villages had undergone preliminary movements, while others had not yet. In terms of methods, each district adopted measures such as registering tenant farmers and debtors, collective mobilization, and collective complaints. The masses quickly demanded action. The masses of ×× village said, "Before, they went to the countryside to collect rent; now, we go to the city to demand land." On June 21, 4,000 peasants from 58 villages in four districts marched into the city in separate groups, beating gongs and drums. Eleven villages in the fifth district carried a large red flag with the words "Return the Land to the Peasants," in a mighty procession. More than 2,000 impoverished citizens from 14 streets in Chengguan District also beat gongs and drums, carrying flags with the words "Urban and Rural Peasants are One Family, Unite to Defeat the Landlords." The two emancipation armies converged and gathered at the Dongguan Square. Landlords with more than one qing (approx. 16.4 acres) of land for every 40 households had been centrally detained by Chengguan City beforehand and were brought to the meeting place for peasants from the surrounding villages to identify. The masses of Chengguan were divided into four groups to participate in assisting the four districts respectively. The "One Pot Cooking" great struggle unfolded in the square. The landlords stood in rows, surrounded by the masses. Peasants from the third district pointed at the heads of landlords Gao Wenkui and Xiao Yixian and said, "We recognize you, we're going to settle accounts with you!" Everyone complained in separate groups: Tang Jishan from the fourth district said to the landlord Sun Guangtian, "I borrowed money from you in the morning, and you came to demand payment on the 28th day of the twelfth month. My family had nothing, but you insisted on taking something, so you took me into the city..." He cried bitterly as he spoke. The high rent and high interest was denounced outside the city, and the extortion and forced labor was denounced inside the city, closely coordinating to refute all the landlords' sophistry. After the group struggles, a public trial was held for the major traitor landlords Tang Bicheng, Wang Runlan, and Gao Wenkui, and the major spies Wu Bo, Lun Qixun, and Han Jie. Tang Bicheng was one of the eight major landlords in Tangyin and served as the puppet district chief for seven years. Wu Bo was the chief of the First Section of Sun Dianying's Political Department and a major spy trained by Japan and the United States. Lun Qixun was the manager of a Japanese company and also the director of the Kuomintang's Sanmin Youth League. These two had murdered 37 of our cadres and militiamen, and the masses hated them to the bone. When they were tied to the meeting place, the masses' eyes burned with anger. After more than 30 people made accusations, the whole audience shouted, "Demand that the government execute the major traitors." The government immediately responded to the masses and carried out the execution, to everyone's great satisfaction. Six thousand people then marched into the city in separate groups, holding a grand parade.

This struggle recovered a total of 8,000 mu of land, 210 written documents, over 1,000 pieces of clothing, and countless other items. The joint emancipation of urban and rural peasants demonstrated unprecedented class unity. For example, when peasants from the sixth district struggled against Lun Qide, citizens from the third street said, "Go to the street office and get it, we dug it out last time and kept it for you." When the peasants left a liquidation committee to clear the fruits of the struggle, the masses closely cooperated and provided materials. However, during the distribution, the urban peasants did not want any of it, saying, "We have already received a lot, the countryside is poorer than the city, you should take all of it this time." Now that the great struggle has ended, peasants in each district are continuing to liquidate separately, and the 20,000 mu of land will soon be fully recovered.

　　汤阴城乡联合开展“一锅煮”
  　八千亩地还家　七大奸霸伏法
    【本报汤阴讯】汤阴城关解放后，贫苦市民即掀起大翻身运动，但城内地主仍霸占着四乡农民两万亩土地，贫苦市民即自动酝酿，帮助四乡穷弟兄解决土地问题，明确了只有城乡团结斗垮地主才能刨倒老根。同时路西三、四区，路东五、六区大部分村庄群众是处在城内地主高租大利剥削之下，也普遍酝酿着：“进城算帐。”这些村有的经初步运动，有的还没有运动，各区在方式上采取登记佃户债户，集体动员，集体诉苦。群众很快即要求行动，××村群众说：“以前他下乡要租子，现在咱进城要土地。”六月二十一日四个区五十八个村，四千农民打着锣鼓，五区十一个村扛着一面“要回农民土地”的大红旗，浩浩荡荡分路入城。城关区十四个街，二千多贫苦市民，也是锣鼓喧天打着“城乡农民是一家，团结起来斗垮地主”的旗子，两股翻身大军会合，齐集东关广场。四十户一顷地以上的地主事先即为城关市集中扣押，都带到会场由四乡农民分别认对象。城关群众分了四片，分别参加帮助四个区，广场人四片片展开了“一锅煮”的大斗争。地主排成一行行站着，群众团团包围。三区农民指着地主高文魁肖义贤的头说：“我们认得你，我们跟你算帐！”大家一片片的分别诉苦：四区唐吉善向地主孙光田说：“上午借你钱，年廿八还来要帐，我家啥也没有，非给你不中，你把我带进城。……”说着痛哭起来。城外诉的高租大利，城内诉的是讹诈出夫，密切配合，打回了地主的一切狡辩。分片斗争后，全体集中公审大汉奸地主唐璧成、王润兰、高文魁，大特务吴渤、伦启逊、韩杰等七大汉奸。唐璧成是汤阴八大地主之一，当伪区长七年。吴渤是孙殿英政治部第一科科长，日本和美国训练出的大特务。伦启逊是日本洋行经理，又是国民党的三青团主任。这二人曾残杀我干部民兵三十七人，群众恨之入骨。当他们被捆到会场时，群众眼睛就火了。三十余人控诉之后，全场高呼：“要求政府枪毙大汉奸”，政府立即答复群众，执行枪决，人人大快。六千群众又分数路入城，举行盛大游行。
    此次斗争共收回土地八千亩，文书二百零一张，衣服千余件，其他东西无算。城关农民联合翻身，表现了空前的阶级团结。如六区农民斗争伦启德时，三街市民就说：“到街公所拿吧，我们上次就挖了出来，给你们留着哩。”农民留下清算委员会，清理果实时，群众密切配合，供给材料，但分配时，城内农民一点也没要，他们说：“我们已分的不少，乡里比城里穷苦，这次你们都要了吧”。现大斗争结束，各区农民正继续分别清算，二万亩土地即将全部收回。
