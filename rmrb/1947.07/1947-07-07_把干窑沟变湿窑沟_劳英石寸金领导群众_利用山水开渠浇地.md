　　【Benbao Licheng Xun】Huo Family Kiln Gully has historically lacked water. Even a slight drought meant having to travel several miles to fetch drinking water, let alone using water for planting seedlings. In 1945, under the leadership of Labor Hero Shi Cun-jin, a canal was dug from the mountains two miles away in Tancun, solving the drinking water problem for the entire village and also allowing for the irrigation of more than 20 mu of land each day. However, the water became scarce during droughts. This spring, the water was even scarcer, and irrigating the land created a drinking water problem, causing the masses to become anxious. After seeing this situation, Labor Hero Shi Cun-jin held a meeting with the village cadres and his apprentices to discuss digging another canal at the base of another mountain to divert water for irrigation, engaging in a long-term struggle against drought. After they made a plan, they went separately to mobilize the masses. Initially, the masses lacked confidence, fearing that they would waste their labor if they couldn't find water. The masses in Fan Family Kiln were unwilling to go because the canal couldn't irrigate their village's land, and the enthusiasm of those in Wang Family Kiln was not high because their village was far from the water and received little irrigation. Finally, the masses from the three natural villages held a unified discussion. Fan Family Kiln could use more water from the old canal for irrigation, and further ideological education was conducted to clear the masses' thinking. They first organized more than 20 people, and after digging for a morning, they found water. After returning at noon, they broadcast the news of the successful canal digging to the masses, boosting their confidence. In the afternoon, they organized more than 50 people to dig. In three days, a total of 120 workdays were spent digging a three-mile-long canal, capable of irrigating more than 50 mu of land day and night. They also plan to dredge the old canal dug in the past, which could irrigate more than 70 mu. The entire village has a total of 1,900 mu of land, and except for the land near the mountains, more than 600 mu of land can be irrigated. After calculation, each mu of land can produce an additional season of crops, and the entire village can increase the yield of over 700 shi of millet. The entire village of 725 people will each have an average increase of one shi of fine grain. The masses reflected, "In less than three days, our village's wheat fields can be irrigated and planted with late corn, and the dry kiln gully can be transformed into a wet kiln gully!"

　　把干窑沟变湿窑沟
  　劳英石寸金领导群众
  　利用山水开渠浇地
    【本报黎城讯】霍家窑沟自古以来缺水，天稍一旱就得跑出好几里路以外去担水吃，更谈不到用水栽苗。四五年在劳英石寸金领导下，从滩村二里以外的山里开了一道水渠，解决了全村群众的吃水困难，每天还能浇二十余亩地。但天一旱水就不大了。今春水更少，要浇地，吃水就成了问题，群众都在发急，劳英石寸金看到这种情况以后，就和村干部及他的徒弟们开会研究到另一个山根再去开渠引水浇地，和旱灾作长期斗争。他们研究好以后，便分头到群众中去进行动员，起初群众信心不大，怕开不出水白误工。樊家窑的群众因这道渠不能浇他们村里的地都不愿去开，王家窑因他村离水远浇地少，劲头也不大。最后三个自然村群众统一讨论，樊家窑可多用旧渠的水浇地，另外又作思想教育，打通了群众的思想，先组织了二十余个人，开了一上午，便把水开出来。晌午回去后，就广播给群众，报告开渠的胜利消息，提高了群众的信心。下午即组织了五十余个人去开，三天共用工一百二十个，把三里长一道水渠挖成了，一明一夜能浇地五十余亩，还计划再把过去开的那道旧渠挖一下，能浇七十余亩，全村共有土地一千九百余亩，除靠山边的地以外，有六百余亩地都能浇。经过计算，每亩地能增加种一季，全村共增加产粮七百余石小米。全村七百二十五口人，每人平均增加一石细粮。群众反映“不用三天，咱村的麦地就能浇完栽晚玉茭，就可把干窑沟变成了湿窑沟啦！”
