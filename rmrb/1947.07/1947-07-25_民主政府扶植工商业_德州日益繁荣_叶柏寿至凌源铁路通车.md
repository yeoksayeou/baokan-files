    Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 23rd: Dezhou City, Bohai District, which has been liberated for just one year, has seen significant development in industry and commerce. In the past year, the democratic government has issued over 42 million Beihai currency (equivalent to 20 yuan in Kuomintang currency) in loans to support the conversion of industry and commerce, as well as over a hundred iron, wood, textile, and soap factories and workshops, and several private banks such as Hezhong, Yilong, Hongju, and Yuzhong. More than ten newly formed cotton, grain, and tea goods yards are also preparing to open for business on auspicious dates.

    Lifeng Boiler Shop had only 300 catties of coal, 16 boilers, one mule, and 10 catties of grain when Dezhou was liberated on June 12th last year. With the government's loan support, it produced 6,000 boilers and over 60,000 catties of plows and agricultural tools in one year. In addition to a profit of 5.7 million yuan (equivalent to 114 million yuan in Kuomintang currency) for the whole year, it also had over 3 million Beihai currency in deposits and raw materials. Hezhong Bank has profited 1.5 million Beihai currency in less than three months of operation, with over a hundred households making current deposits and overdrafts daily, absorbing 6 million in deposits and issuing over 4.5 million in loans daily. The "Fahui" (Kuomintang currency exchange) exchange, formed by the Federation of Industry and Commerce, sees daily transactions of 150 million Beihai currency. In recent months, bank overdrafts have more than doubled compared to two months ago, with remittances reaching over 11 million yuan for the entire month. Two months ago, there were still over a hundred empty houses on Taiping Street, but now they have all become emerging shops.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jireliao, 23rd: Yebaishou, a major town at the junction of the Jinzhou-Chengde and Yebaishou-Chifeng railways, elected railway worker leader Ma Haifu as its county head after being liberated by the People's Liberation Army in June. The county has a population of 160,000, and the market has now recovered. Telephone lines connect west to Lingyuan and east to Guanyingzi, and the Yebaishou-Chifeng telephone line is also under construction. The Yebaishou-Lingyuan railway has been opened to traffic. The democratic government has issued 150 catties of relief grain per person to help poor workers, and those who wish to farm are also allocated land to enable them to settle down and build a career.
