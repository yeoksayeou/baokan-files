Poor and Hired Laborers as the Mainstay, Filling the Poor and Assisting the Needy
Gaoling Rationally Distributes the Fruits of Labor

[This newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu dispatch, 15th] In Nanfeng, Gaoling, poor peasant backbone elements were established to implement the principle of filling the poor and assisting the needy, and to rationally distribute the fruits of labor. In the past, Bai Mao Village in Gaoling distributed according to grades, which did not satisfy the demands of the poor peasants. One poor woman needed a bed, but could not afford it because she was 100 yuan short. The middle peasant Guo Shuangben's family had two vats, and they received another large vat. Guo Xikun and his wife came from a famine-stricken area, and had no land to cultivate; last time, they only received two dou of grain and one bundle of firewood. This time, when distributing the fruits of labor, the matter was first handed over to the peasants for discussion. Everyone unanimously approved of "filling the poor and assisting the needy" and not distributing according to grades. A thorough investigation was conducted to determine who lacked what, and the class status was strictly delineated. The destitute peasants were given priority, followed by the poor peasants. In order to unite the middle peasants, the remainder was distributed to the middle peasants. After this distribution, the masses all said, "If it weren't for this method, we wouldn't be able to fill the poor people's pits even if we distributed three more times." In Hufengzhai and Liuzhi Village in Nanfeng, the fruits of labor were previously distributed according to three classes and nine grades. During the third distribution of the fruits of labor, the poor peasants wanted to use the method of filling the poor and assisting the needy, while the middle peasants believed that the method of three classes and nine grades was already very reasonable. If all the fruits of labor were given to the poor peasants, it would be too unfair to the middle peasants who contributed the same amount of labor. When this argument could not be resolved, someone proposed "democratic resolution, obeying the majority," but since the majority of members in the peasant association were middle peasants, no results were achieved. Subsequently, a meeting of poor peasant activists and village cadres was convened. Through comparing the actual living standards of poor peasants with the accounts of middle peasants, they recognized the flaws in the past distribution of the fruits of labor and implemented the spirit of filling the poor and assisting the needy. It was decided to establish a poor peasant group, elect poor peasant representatives, and completely entrust the discussion to the poor peasants to determine specific distribution methods: (1) Poor peasants, whether inside or outside the association, would be allocated the same. (2) Livestock carts, farm tools, and furniture would be completely allocated by the peasant association. (3) Money would be allocated according to five grades for all members. (4) In addition to the poor peasant group, those most severely flooded last year would be allocated grain, thus taking care of the middle peasants. (5) Clothes, cotton, looms, and spinning wheels would be allocated by the women's association. The poor peasant group elected seven appraisers, who began to appraise and allocate. The appraisal committee separated the farm tools and allowed the peasants to inspect them to understand what was available, and then registered each household's needs. Based on the amount of land, population, living conditions, and historical circumstances, they approved what each household needed. After the fruits of labor were distributed in this way, with the poor peasants as the mainstay, everyone believed it was reasonable.

    贫雇为主填贫补穷
    高陵合理分配果实
    【本报冀鲁豫十五日电】高陵南峰树立贫农骨干，实行填贫补穷，合理分配果实。高陵白毛村过去两次都是按等级分配的，不能满足贫农要求。一位贫苦妇女需要一张床，但因差一百元不能要。中农郭双本家有两个缸，又分了一个大缸。郭希坤两口子逃荒来的，垄地皆无，上次只分得二斗粮食、一捆柴。这次分果实时，首先交给农民讨论，大家一致赞成“填贫补穷”，不按等级分，确实调查，谁家缺啥少啥，严格划分阶层，先让赤贫拿，然后贫农拿，为了团结中农，剩下的分给中农。这样分后，群众都说：“要不是这办法，再分三次也填不起穷人的坑”。南峰沪丰宅、刘掷村，过去分果实是按三等九级，第三次分配果实时，贫农要用填贫补穷办法，而中农认为三等九级办法已很合理，如果实都叫贫农得了，中农一样出力太吃亏，这种论调得不到解决时，有人提出：“民主解决，服从多数”，但农会中多为中农成份，仍无结果，随即召开贫农积极分子及村干部会议，从现实贫农生活水平和中农算帐比较中，认识过去分果实的毛病和贯彻了填贫补穷的精神，确定划分贫农组，选出贫农代表，完全交贫农讨论，确定具体分配办法：（一）不论会内会外，贫农同样分配。（二）牲口大车、农具、家具完全由农会分配。（三）钱按全体会员分五等分配。（四）粮食除贫农组外，去年被淹最厉害的分，这样照顾中农。（五）衣服、棉花、织布机纺花车由妇会分配。贫农组选出七个评议员，开始评议分配，评议会把农具分开，让农民们去检验，了解有啥，然后登记各户需要的东西，按地亩、人口、生活情形、历史情形批准每户所要的东西，这样以贫农为主的把果实分下去后，大家都认为合理。
