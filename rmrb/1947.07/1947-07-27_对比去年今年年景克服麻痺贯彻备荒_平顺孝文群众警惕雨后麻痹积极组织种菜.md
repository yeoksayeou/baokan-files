　　The masses of Xiaowen Village, Pingshun, are vigilant against post-rain complacency and actively organize vegetable planting.
    [This newspaper, Pingshun] Xiaowen Village, in the first district, experienced a rain on the 14th, and it was discovered that the masses and cadres had developed a complacent attitude towards drought prevention and famine preparation. Wu Shiao said, "We don't have to worry here! The crops are growing better than in Wangzhuang and Chengguan. There won't be a shortage of rain in the future, the harvest will be good, and the famine won't be too serious." On the 16th, a meeting of all village cadres and mutual aid team leaders was convened in the evening, using the comparison between last year's crops and this year's crops to discuss whether there had been a reduction in yield. In addition, examples of insufficient acreage, insufficient seedlings in some fields, and reduced yields due to late weeding were used to break the cadres' complacency. On the 17th, village-wide mass meetings were held by mutual aid teams to discuss whether there would be no fear of famine after this rain and how to carry out production and famine preparation. During the discussion, labor hero Wu Delan said, "At this time last year, the corn was more than ten feet tall and was already tasseling. The pumpkins and cowpeas were growing vigorously. This year, the corn is only three or four feet tall. Even if there is no shortage of rain in the future, what will it grow into? The seedlings of gourds and cowpeas have just been turned over. Although there has been this rain, the yields of various crops have already been reduced. Our climate here is cold and cannot be compared with hot places." Luo Chenglong said, "We can't be careless. Even in a good year, we must 'prevent shortages every year.' Haven't you heard the old people say, 'People starve to death under the ears of grain. Who dares to guarantee that nothing will go wrong in the future!'" In this way, everyone was awakened through discussion, realizing that the serious famine was still pressing on their heads, and the complacent attitude towards the famine was dispelled. As a result, everyone actively turned to production and famine preparation, and came up with ways to continue production and famine preparation: (1) Because the crops have not grown well due to drought, it is necessary to quickly apply top dressing and hoe more to help them grow well and increase grain production. (2) Plant more crops such as radishes, vegetables, turnips, and barley to make up for the reduction in the yield of regular products. (3) Implement weaving throughout the year, weaving and wearing our own clothes, and strive to exchange surplus cloth for grain to subsidize the poor harvest. (4) Mix bran with vegetables and save food. (5) Each team should extract surplus labor to go out to transport and engage in sideline occupations. According to these methods, a fifteen-day assault plan was immediately formulated: On the 18th and 19th, concentrate on planting vegetables, turnips, radishes, barley, etc. On the 19th and 20th, apply top dressing and rush to complete the second weeding. From the 21st onwards, continue to apply top dressing for ten days and complete the third weeding. Finally, summarize the weeding and evaluate the merit. In the top dressing, it was discovered that there was a difficulty in not being able to apply fertilizer due to lack of manure, so oil was created to apply top dressing (two jin per mu), which saved labor and fertilized the seedlings. In the assault planting of vegetables, the idea of reserving land to plant late vegetables was discovered. Wu Fengde said: "First-volt radishes, second-volt vegetables, third-volt buckwheat comes quickly. It is not too late to plant vegetables." Immediately use the heavy yield of direct vegetables to prevent not being able to plant due to later drought, breaking the idea of reserving land to plant late vegetables. The old man Xiao Zhao, who is over sixty years old, said: "Wu Changhai waited to plant the combined-ridge millet in the spring. Later, it couldn't be planted due to lack of rain. The millet planted by others earlier grew so tall. His millet has not yet been hoeed and thinned. See who has suffered the loss? Direct radishes grow thick and can be dried into more strips (weight). Late vegetables do not grow big and only contain water and cannot be made into strips. It is better to take advantage of the land to plant direct vegetables." After clarifying the thinking, more than 56.7 mu of radishes, vegetables, and turnips have been planted in more than one day. Now they are continuing to plant vegetables, rushing to apply top dressing, and pulling the second and third weeding.

    [This newspaper, Wuxiang] County-level organs and cadres reclaim wasteland and plant vegetables, and practice strict economy. On the afternoon of July 14, the county government convened a joint conference of cadres from county-level organs and all cadres and students from the cadre school and medical school. County Mayor Li pointed out that although Wuxiang has recently received some rain, the wheat harvest has already fallen short by 70,000 shi, and the autumn crops are not fully planted. At the same time, more than 20 villages have been hit by hailstorms. No matter what happens in the future, from the current point of view, the famine has actually formed. Cadres must first break the complacent thinking. After the meeting, the cadres have all made their own production and conservation plans. The cadres of the county government have begun to personally dig the ground to plant radishes every afternoon, and the cadres of the county committee have also personally dug the ground to plant vegetables. In just three days, more than two mu of land have been dug. The Public Security Bureau boils its own salt and produces one jin every day, which is enough for its own consumption. Cadres of other organs are also digging the ground to plant vegetables, learning to boil salt, and making native dyes. All organs have uniformly reduced their living standards, saving two liang of millet per day, and collecting wild vegetables to replace food.

　　对比去年今年年景克服麻痺贯彻备荒
    平顺孝文群众警惕雨后麻痹积极组织种菜
    【本报平顺讯】一区孝文村在十四日下了场雨，发现群众干部对防旱备荒产生麻痹思想。认为下雨啦！有水吃了，庄稼还可以长；吴时熬说：“咱这里不怕啦！庄稼长的比王庄、城关都强些，以后不缺雨，年景还可以，灾荒不很严重啦。”于十六日夜召集全村干部和互助组长会，用去年的庄稼和今年的庄稼对比，讨论是否已减收了，再加上垧不足，有些地不够苗和没锄开的晚苗已减收的实例等打破干部麻痹思想。十七日夜又以互助组为单位召开了全村的群众会议，讨论下这场雨后是不是就不怕灾荒啦？怎样来进行生产备荒？在讨论中劳动英雄吴德兰说：“去年这时玉茭长的一丈多高，正在垛穗，南瓜、豆角很吃开啦；今年现在玉茭长的才三、四尺高，就是以后不缺雨了，还能长成个啥？瓜、豆角苗才翻呀，虽下了这场雨，各种庄稼已减少收成了，咱这里气候冷不能比热的地方。”罗成龙说：“咱可不敢大意，就是好年景也得‘年年防歉’，没听老人说：“谷穗底下饿死人，谁敢保险以后不出岔啦！”这样从讨论中惊醒了大家，认识了严重的灾荒仍在自己头上压着，打通了对灾荒的麻痹思想，于是都积极转向生产备荒这方面来，并想出了继续生产备荒的办法：（一）因天旱庄稼没长好，要赶快上追粪，多锄、扶助他长好增加产粮。（二）多种萝卜、菜、蔓菁、大麦等作物，补救正产物的减收。（三）纺织贯彻全年，自织自穿，争取以余布换粮，补助歉收。（四）掺糠吃菜，节省粮食。（五）各组抽出剩余劳力，出外运输捣副业。根据这些办法当即订出了十五天的突击计划：十八、十九两天突击种菜、蔓菁、萝卜、大麦等，十九、二十两天上追粪，突击拉完二遍苗。二十一往后十一天继续上追粪，拉完三遍苗。最后总结锄苗评选立功。在上追粪中发现没粪不能上的困难，即创造用油上追粪（一亩上二斤），又省工，又肥苗。突击种菜中又发现留地等种晚菜思想，吴丰德说：“头伏萝卜，二伏菜，三伏荞麦来的快。种菜还不迟。”当即用直菜收量重，防备后旱种不上，打破了留地等种晚菜思想。六十余岁的老汉小招说：“吴长孩春天等种合垅谷。后来没雨种不上啦，人家早种上的谷长的多高啦，他的谷还没锄间苗，你看谁吃了亏啦？直萝卜长的粗大又能多晒出条子（斤重），晚菜长不大光水分成不出条子，还是趁垧种直菜。”打通思想后在一天多时间中，已种萝卜、菜、蔓菁五十六亩七分。现正继续种菜，突击上追粪，拉二、三遍苗。

    【本报武乡讯】县级各机关干部开荒种菜，厉行节约。七月十四日下午，在县府召开县级各机关干部及干校医校全体干部学员联合大会，李县长指出：武乡最近虽然落了些雨，但麦子已歉收七万石，秋禾亦不全苗，同时又有二十余村遭了雹灾，不管今后如何，从现在来看，实际上灾荒已形成，干部首先一定要打破麻痹思想。会后各干部都纷纷自订生产节约计划，县府干部已开始每日下午亲自动手刨地种萝卜，县委会干部亦亲自刨地种菜。仅三天时间，已刨地二亩多，公安局自己熬盐，每日出一斤，足够自己吃用。其他各机关干部们，亦均动手刨地种菜，学习熬盐，制造土染料。各机关一律降低生活水平，每日节约二两小米，并采野菜代食。
