  　Joyfully Celebrate the Party's Birthday
    Strengthen the Connection Between the Party and the Masses
  　Announce the List of Twenty-Six Party Members
    [Our Newspaper's Report] On "July 1st," all Party members in the Ninth District of Wu'an and the broad masses of liberated peasants united around the Party celebrated the Party's birthday with extremely joyful hearts. On that day, the masses of each village regarded the Party's birthday as their own and got up early, wearing clean clothes, beating drums and gongs, and converging on the meeting place—the Ninth District government seat in Huiliu. When the meeting began, all the people present stood in solemn respect, paying tribute to the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and paying tribute to the comrades of the Central Bureau who directly lead us. Then, County Magistrate Zhang Hanlin reported on the Party's heroic struggle history, saying: "Since its birth, the Communist Party has always sought the interests and happiness of the people. With the Communist Party, the Chinese people have a way out, and China has a bright future." Finally, he said: "The Communist Party is unprecedentedly strong, and we will launch a great counter-offensive to defeat Chiang Kai-shek, the biggest bully in the country!" Before he finished speaking, the meeting place immediately erupted with shouts of "Help the masses in the Chiang-controlled areas to liberate themselves!" Then, Comrade Zhang Xiuliang, the Party representative of the Ninth District, reported on the history of the Party in the district. He said: "The Communist Party took root in this district in 1938 and has grown stronger day by day ever since. During these years, it has done three major things for the people: First, it led the masses to oppose the unreasonable system of equal apportionment and to oppose the corruption of chiefs and leaders. Second, it led the masses to implement rent and interest reduction, oppose bullies, and some of the masses obtained land. And it led the masses to overcome unprecedented famine. Third, it thoroughly liberated the peasants and implemented the policy of 'land to the tiller'. Finally, in order to further strengthen the connection between Party members and the masses, and to enable the masses to directly supervise the progress of Party members, Comrade Zhang Xiuliang announced the names of twenty-six Communist Party members from fourteen villages in the Ninth District. At this time, everyone looked at the Communist Party members with envious eyes, feeling that it was an unparalleled honor to be a Communist Party member.
    Party members gloriously walked out of the crowd, and the melodious music sent them to the rostrum, standing in front of the masses, and wearing red flowers on their chests. Receiving the respect of the masses, they felt that their responsibilities were even heavier. Comrade Chen Xueshan from Yetao Township said well: "Today I am here to celebrate our Party, and I feel very happy. After I became a Communist Party member, I cooperated with the masses to overthrow the landlords in our village, and the masses had food and drink, and the masses became the masters of their own affairs. In the future, I will also lead the masses to do a good job in resisting drought and preparing for famine, and engage in production and frugality. If I have any shortcomings, please give me more advice."
    The masses' feelings of love for the Party were truly unstoppable. Zhang Kangnian from Yetao suddenly stood up from the crowd, walked to the rostrum, and said with emotion: "In the past, it was really impossible for the poor to live. They couldn't eat enough, they couldn't wear warm clothes, they came crying and left crying! Now they are all liberated. They have land, they have houses, all thanks to the Communist Party's leadership in our struggle, and I understand it thoroughly. We will do whatever the Communist Party tells us to do. Their vision is really far-sighted and clear."
    Li Rongjiang, a demobilized soldier who had worn flowers five times, said after paying tribute to the Communist Party members: "Some of us demobilized soldiers have friction with the cadres, and we regard ourselves as outsiders. If we are called upon to perform tasks, we don't perform them; if we are called upon to do something, we don't do it! We have forgotten that we have followed the Communist Party all the way. This is not good. In the future, we must listen to the government and respond to the call of the Communist Party."
    Finally, District Chief Zhang Shengrong announced: In order to welcome "July 1st," the masses in the entire district have launched a movement to resist drought, prepare for famine, and engage in production and frugality. According to the five-day statistics of only twenty villages, 10,763 mu of land have been dug and prepared for planting when it rains, and 6,912 mu have already been planted. In terms of frugality, 90% of the households have exchanged food, and a total of 134,542 jin of wild vegetables have been collected, 62,123 kilns of melons have been planted, and women have spun 6,602 jin of yarn. The noon meeting ended with cheers and slogans!

　　武安九区党员群众
  　欢欣庆祝我党生日
    加强党与群众的联系
  　公布廿六个党员名单
    【本报讯】“七一”，武安九区全区党员同志和团结在党周围的广大翻身农民，都以极愉快的心情庆祝党的生日。当天各村群众把党的生日看成自己生日都早早起来，穿着干干净净的衣裳，打着旗鼓，向开会的地址——九区政府所在地汇流。开会时，到会群众全体肃立，向党中央和毛主席致敬，向直接领导我们的中央局同志致敬。接着张汉林县长报告党的英勇奋斗历史，他说：“共产党自诞生以来，就时时刻刻给人民谋利益，谋幸福，有了共产党，中国人民才有出路，中国才有了光明。”最后他说：“共产党空前强大了，咱就要大反攻，打垮全国顶大的恶霸蒋介石！”他的话未落音会场立即爆发出“帮助蒋管区群众翻身！”的呼声。接着九区党代表张秀亮同志报告本区党的历史。他说：“一九三八年共产党就在这个区扎根了，一直到现在，一天比一天壮大。在这几年中间，它给人民做了三件大事：头一件是领导群众反对不合理的平均摊派制度，反对保长、社长贪污。第二件是领导群众实行减租减息，反恶霸，群众部分得到了土地。并领导群众，战胜了空前未有的灾荒。第三件是彻底翻身，实行了耕者有其田。最后为了更加密切党员与群众的联系，使群众直接监督党员的前进，张秀亮同志公布九区十四个村共二十六个共产党员名字。这时，人人以羡慕的眼光瞻仰着共产党员，感到当一个共产党员无上光荣。
    党员同志从人群中光荣的走出来，悠扬的乐声，把他们送到主席台上，站在群众面前，给他们胸前挂上红花。他们受到群众的尊敬，更感到自己的责任加重。冶陶镇陈雪山同志说得好：“今天我来给我党庆祝，我觉得非常高兴。我当了共产党员以后，协同群众把俺村地主打下去了，群众有了吃喝，群众当了家。以后，我还要领导群众好好抗旱备荒，搞生产节约。我有啥缺点，多给我提意见。”
    群众对于党，热爱的感情，实在抑止不住了，冶陶张康年从人丛中忽地站起来，走到主席台前，感动的说：“过去穷人们真是没法过，吃不饱，穿不暖，哭里来，哭里去！现在都翻身了。地有了，房子有了，这都是共产党领导我们斗争的，我算认识透了。共产党叫咱干啥咱就干啥，人家的眼光，真算是看得远，看得清。”
    带过五次花的荣退军人李荣江向共产党员致敬后说：“我们荣退军人，有的和干部闹磨擦，把自己划成天外的人，叫支差，不支差，叫干啥，不干啥！我们忘了自己是跟着共产党走过来的，这样不好，以后咱们要听政府的话，响应共产党的号召。”
    最后张生荣区长宣称：为了迎接“七一”，全区群众开展了抗旱备荒、生产节约运动，仅二十个村的五天统计，刨好窑等下雨种的地有一○七六三亩，已下种的六九一二亩，在节约方面，换了饭的户已有百分之九十了，还共采野菜一三四五四二斤，种瓜六二一二三窑，妇女纺织六六○二斤。正午大会于欢呼口号声中散会！
