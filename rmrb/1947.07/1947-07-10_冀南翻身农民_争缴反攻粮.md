　　Supporting the Front Lines, Welcoming Victory

　　Jinnan Liberated Peasants
  　Compete to Pay Re-Conquest Grain
    [Report from our Jinnan office on the 8th] To welcome victory, liberated peasants in Jinnan are enthusiastically paying re-conquest grain. When Sheyizhai in Qi County began paying on the 15th, a widow in her sixties, Zhang, carried thirty to forty catties to the village office, saying, "In the past, I didn't have land, even if I wanted to pay, I couldn't!" In order to ensure the front lines win battles, the whole village exceeded four thousand two hundred catties. When the masses in the urban area of ​​Daming heard that wheat was to be collected, they were busy winnowing wheat and picking out soil clods, saying, "It would be disrespectful to the soldiers on the front if we didn't pay good wheat." All twenty-nine streets in the city completed payment within three hours. Why was it paid so quickly? Just as Wang Zhenqing from North Street said: "If it weren't for the Eighth Route Army, the Chiang troops would still be occupying this place, let alone eating new wheat, we wouldn't even be alive!" Chu Dakui from Feng Niuba town, Fourth District of Wuyi, harvested four big dou of wheat this year. When the village cadre saw that he had harvested too little during the levy, and didn't assign him any, he found the village chief and said, "Why didn't you count me in? Am I not a person from our village?" Then he said, "I have turned over a new leaf, married a wife, and should have repaid the Communist Party's kindness long ago. Don't look down on me just because I only harvested four big dou of wheat, this time I will definitely support the front lines with thirty catties." The village chief had nothing to say but to accept his wheat. Chu Dakui happily said, "Giving public grain to the Eighth Route Army to eat is more enjoyable than eating it myself!" Zhang Bitang from Zhangshijiazhuang is a thirteen-year-old child. When the village was collecting wheat, he saw his mother bring back six catties of wheat. He eagerly and naively ran up to her and said, "Mom, now our army is launching a counter-offensive against the old Chiang on the front lines. We should support the front lines so we can win sooner. What are you bringing back this little wheat for? Take it back and hand it in." His mother praised him and took the dustpan back to the village office, handing in the six catties of wheat again. Wang Guiqin, a military dependent from Lezhuang in Pingyuan, paid twenty catties more wheat, saying, "I will pay more public grain so that my son can defeat Chiang Kai-shek and return home sooner."
    [Report from our Jiaozuo office] The people in the enemy-occupied area of ​​Jiaozuo will never forget the Eighth Route Army. After the wheat harvest, in the first four villages, old ladies, women, and children, hiding from the traitors and bullies, carried small bamboo baskets with homespun cloth inside and green vegetables on top. They pretended to be visiting relatives, in groups of three or five, to pay patriotic public grain. They found our district chief and said, "We can't send grain, so we're sending some cloth." An old man said, "District chief, we don't know how much to give this year, our village is still giving according to last year's amount!" The district chief said, "Our government is taking care of the people in the enemy-occupied areas, so this year your village's burden is reduced by half compared to last year." The old lady said, "What you are giving us is not even a fraction of what the enemy wants. We all know the district is staying here, if we don't send you something, we'll feel bad. Everyone in the village wants to send something, but that bastard Xue ×× won't let us." Even those who are being struggled against came to send public grain, saying, "Whoever gets a haircut feels cool." They treasure the grain receipts printed by the municipal government and say, "This is being sent to the right place, on the way we're afraid it will end up in the 'City God Temple' (meaning they were afraid the Bao Chang would take it). We are the first wave, after we go back we'll tell them all to come and send grain." (Geng Chao)

　　冀南翻身农民
  　争缴反攻粮
    【本报冀南八日电】迎接胜利，冀南各地翻身农民踊跃缴反攻粮。企之县舍易寨十五日开始缴纳时，六十余岁的寡妇张氏背着三四十斤送到村公所，她说：“过去没地想缴也没有呀”！群众为了叫前方打胜仗，全村超过四千二百余斤。大名城关群众听说要征麦，都忙着簸麦挑土块，纷纷说：“不缴好麦子对不起前方将士”。全市二十九道街，三个钟头内交齐了。为什么交这么快呢？正象北街王振清所说：“要不是八路军，蒋军还在这占着，别说吃新麦，咱连命也活不成呀”！武邑四区冯牛八镇楚大魁今年收了四大斗麦子，借征时村干看他收的太少没派他的，他就找到村长说：“你们怎么不打我的数呢？我不是咱村的人吗？”接着又说：“我翻了身，娶了老婆，早该报共产党的恩了，别看我只收了四大斗麦子，这次一定支援前线三十斤”。说的村长没话说，只有收下他的麦子。楚大魁喜欢的说：“交了公粮叫八路军吃，比我自己吃了还痛快哩”。张史家庄张毕堂是一个十三岁的小孩子，村里麦征时他看妈妈拿回来六斤麦子，他急忙天真的跑到跟前说：“娘，现在咱的军队正在前线反攻打老蒋，咱该支援前线，好早些胜利，还拿回来这点麦子干啥，再回去缴上去吧”。他妈妈一面夸奖他，一面端簸箕回到村公所，把六斤麦子又缴上了。平原乐庄抗属王桂琴多缴麦子二十斤，他说：“我多缴些公粮好叫我的儿子早日把蒋介石打败好回家”。
    【本报焦作讯】焦作市敌占区老百姓忘不了八路军，麦收后先有四个村，老太太、妇女、儿童瞒着奸霸们，手里提着小竹篮，里边放的是土布，顶上盖的是青菜，他们以串亲戚为名，三、五个一伙伙的来交纳爱国公粮，找着咱们的区长说：“我们没法送粮，送来些布。”一个老汉说：“区长，咱不知道今年该出多少，我们村上还是按去年的数出的！”区长说：“咱们政府为了照顾敌占区的老百姓，今年你村比去年负担减轻一半。”老太太说：“给咱们送的还没有敌人要的零头多哩，俺都知道区上在这里住，不给咱们送点东西我心里过不去，村人都想送，就是薛××这杂种不叫送。”斗争对象也来送公粮，并说：“谁剃头谁凉快。”他们把市府印的各花户送粮收据很宝贵的保存起来，并说：“这可送到正经地点了，在路上光怕进了‘城皇庙’（怕保长弄走的意思），我们是头一炮，回去后叫他们都来送。”　　　　　（更朝）
