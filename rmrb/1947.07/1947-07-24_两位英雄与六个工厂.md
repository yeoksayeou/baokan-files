Two Heroes and Six Factories

The women of Berlin, Wu'an, under the leadership of Guo Hengde and Guo Fanzi, established six small textile factories. These are the heroic textile factories that the masses are now spreading the word about everywhere. Their factories were established in February of this year. At that time, some farmers had the mentality of being afraid of "cutting the chives" [TL note: meaning being afraid of anything that might resemble capitalist exploitation], while the newly emancipated households were eating and drinking extravagantly. Seeing this phenomenon, the two immediately discussed a solution, educating the masses separately. First, they selected several newly emancipated households, helping them calculate the "time" [TL note: meaning how much time they had been emancipated from the old feudal system], calculating whether the "emancipation time" had been long enough, and what to do if it wasn't. They inspired the masses to consciously produce and, together with these households, discussed concrete methods for production and frugality. After this demonstration by exemplary households, they then universally called for family meetings to calculate "time." Through such arduous education, they not only dispelled the masses' ideological concerns about struggle and eliminated extravagant eating and wasting, but also especially established the masses' concept of developing a prosperous life through production. Families began to save money, making plans for frugality and preparing for famine, and women requested to organize textile work. On this basis, they convened a women's congress, first praising the great role that women had played in overcoming famine in the past, and then calling on women to organize textile factories. At the beginning, the women were afraid of not being free in the factories, afraid of weaving for the public, and dared not organize factories. They immediately used their own already-organized factory to introduce to everyone: "The organizational form of the factory is based on the living habits of the people. Those who are willing to eat and work together can come together. Those who are unwilling to be collective or whose families cannot be separated can be freely dispersed. All the money earned belongs to oneself. The factory system has work tickets and dividends are distributed according to work points. Those who want to wear cloth can also allocate labor to help each other..." This dispelled the masses' doubts about the factory and various ideological concerns. Then, five factories were voluntarily combined, together with the one already established, for a total of six small textile factories. Their factories not only organize women to weave, but also combine with family agricultural and sideline occupations. For example, during the summer harvest, the factory set a ten-day plan, both harvesting wheat and weaving. Sure enough, they all helped their families finish harvesting the wheat in four days, and in six days each person wove two jin of cloth. In terms of sideline occupations, the six factories collectively raised nineteen pigs. Everyone pooled money to buy troughs, took turns feeding the pigs, and planned to raise two more hens per person.

Their leadership of the female spinners takes the approach of more rewards and less criticism. Regarding spinning thread: because good thread is often praised, the attitude towards bad thread is not to reward or punish, but third-class thread has gradually decreased and even disappeared. In terms of tools, they promote the "hand-pulled shuttle weaving machine" and the "accelerated wheel spinning machine," which produce products that are both good and fast.

According to three months of statistics, each person in the factory wove forty-two jin of cloth. The first dividend was an average of 10,000 yuan per person, and the second time it was more than 21,000 yuan. Now, when people mention Guo Hengde and Guo Fanzi's textile factory, everyone praises them. (Shi Feng)

　　两位英雄与六个工厂
    武安柏林的妇女们在郭恒的、郭凡子的领导下成立了六个小型纺织工厂，这就是现在群众到处传扬着的英雄纺织厂。她们的工厂成立于今年二月，当时有些农民存在着怕割韭菜的思想，而翻身户则大吃大喝，他两人看到这种现象，立即商定办法，分别教育群众，首先选择了几家翻身户，帮助她们算时光，算翻身时光是否够过了，不够过该怎办？启发群众生产自觉，又和这几家共同商议出生产节约的具体办法。经过这样典型户的示范，然后普遍号召开家庭会，进行算时光。经过这样艰苦的教育，不仅解除了群众怕斗争的思想顾虑，消灭了大吃浪费现象，尤其树立了群众生产发家观念。各家开始省吃俭用，订节约备荒的计划，妇女要求组织纺织。在这样基础上，她们就召开妇女大会，首先表扬了妇女过去在渡荒中起了很大作用，接着号召妇女组织纺织工厂。开始妇女们恐怕到工厂里不自由，怕给公家纺织，不敢组织工厂。她们当即拿自己已经组织起的工厂给大家做介绍：“工厂组织形式依老百姓生活习惯规定，愿意集体的吃饭做活都到一起，不愿集体或家庭离不开的可自由分散，赚下钱全归自己，工厂制有工票按工分红。愿穿布的工厂还可拨工互助……”如此解除了群众对工厂的怀疑及各种思想顾虑。随即自愿结合组织了五个工厂，连早已成立起的一个共有六个小型纺织厂。她们的工厂不仅组织妇女纺织，且和家庭农副业结合，如夏收时，工厂订了十天计划，一面收麦一面纺织，果然四天工夫都帮助家里收完了麦子，六天每人又纺织完布二斤。副业方面，六个工厂共喂猪十九口，大家并钱置槽，轮流喂猪，并计划每人再养两只母鸡。
    她们对纺妇的领导，是采取多奖励，少批评的方法。就纺线来说：由于经常表扬好线，对坏线采取不奖不罚的态度，但三等线却逐渐的少而至消灭了。工具方面推行“手拉梭织布机”和“加速轮纺花车”，成品又好又快。
    根据三个月的统计，工厂每人纺织布四十二斤，第一次分红每人平均一万元，第二次两万一千多元，现在一提起郭恒的、郭凡子的纺织厂，群众无不称赞。（石峰）
