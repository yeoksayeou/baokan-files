　　Having Turned Over Under the Banner of Chairman Mao
  　Tunliu Shangcun Labor Hero
  　Ge Hetang Becomes Prosperous
    [This Report from Taiyue, 29th] Ge Hetang, a labor hero from Tunliu fostered by the Communist Party, has become wealthy. Ge Hetang, originally from Lin County, Henan, had only one load of rice when he fled to Tunliu. Now, he owns 190 mu of land (70 mu of which are burden land, the rest newly reclaimed), nine head of cattle, four donkeys, forty pigs, nine sheep, twenty-eight chickens, and has planted over two hundred fruit trees. His total annual income reaches several million. All nineteen members of his family participate in labor, and he employs five long-term workers. This year, Old Ge planted 60 mu of wheat, 80 mu of millet, 22 mu of beans, 15 mu of corn, 1 mu of cotton, 5 mu of yams, and 3 mu each of hemp and pumpkins, all cultivated meticulously. Except for the wheat fields, the land was plowed three times, with an average of 50 loads of manure applied per mu. For millet, corn, and cotton, some areas received up to 140 loads. A good harvest is expected this year.

    Old Ge is also skilled at leading sideline production. This spring, the flour mill was very profitable, and he bought six large pigs for 148,000 Jichaopiao (currency). Two large carts transporting goods to and from Qinyuan earned 15,000 Jichaopiao. Last year, he also bought seven rooms in a multi-story building, and in the latter half of this year, five litters of piglets are expected to be born, along with three broods of chickens and two lambs. Seven women in the family can spin cotton, and four can weave cloth. This spring, they spun 140 jin of cotton yarn and wove 220 zhang of cloth, with higher quality than average. This spring, they spun and wove 23.5 jin of military cloth, the best in the entire village.

    Old Ge's only method for leading the family's production is to promote democracy and encourage everyone's enthusiasm. Before each production season, he convenes family meetings for discussion and assignment of tasks. After the spring plowing was completed, he summarized and rewarded everyone. For example, he gave his eldest nephew a towel and a set of single-layer clothing, each niece a thimble and a towel, his second nephew's wife a shirt, and Old Ge's wife a shirt, further boosting everyone's morale. He treats his hired workers exceptionally well. Cui Zhengqi, the head miller at the flour mill, earns a yearly wage of 17 shi of wheat and millet, and is allowed to cultivate four mu of land in his spare time, with the income for his own use.

    Old Ge not only leads his family's production but is also an organizer and leader of production in the entire village. Shangcun consists of thirty-two small villages forming an administrative village, which is very dispersed. Old Ge and the cadres worked together to organize thirteen male mutual aid teams, including seventy-three full and semi-laborers, and five women's mutual aid teams, with twenty-two members. They have also trained several leading cadres, such as Zhang Wangzhong and Dang Mi'er.

    Old Ge is also a model of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to the families of soldiers and martyrs. His family alone cultivated land on behalf of nine families of military personnel, including Wang Gong and Li Menghu. They also wove 100 zhang of cloth for them without pay, lent 30 shi of grain, 10 jin of cotton, 20 jin of vermicelli, and 7 jin of starch sheets to eight families of military personnel, along with 10,000 Jichaopiao, to help them buy livestock, find wives, and open oil presses. This spring, they have made six pairs of military shoes, and contributed 54,000 Jichaopiao and 400 jin of vermicelli to comfort the troops.

    His village is small and cannot establish a school, so Old Ge gathered two children from his neighbors and his three nephews and hired a teacher. In addition to the five students sharing the cost of rice, Old Ge is responsible for the rest of the oil, salt, and vegetables.

    Because Old Ge came from a poor background, although he is now so wealthy, he still pays attention to saving and thrift at all times. This spring, seeing the lack of rain, he began to prepare for drought and famine. From February, he began mixing chaff with vegetables. By May, he had saved a total of 270 jin of millet, 108 liang of salt, and 180 jin of white flour.
    [This Report from Taiyue, 29th] Qinyuan Chengguan people, famous nationwide for encircling the enemy during the War of Resistance Against Japan, have, since the liberation and return to the city, revitalized Qinyuan City under the leadership of the Communist Party. When the city was liberated, it had been reduced to scorched earth by the Japanese invaders, with only three broken houses remaining. The fields surrounding the city were barren, and the masses had no means of livelihood. With the approval of the Communist Party to the farmers' demands and the implementation of land reform, a large-scale production campaign was launched this spring. The 150 women in the Second Street now have 93 spinning wheels and have spun 656 jin of cotton this spring, achieving self-sufficiency in clothing for the entire street. The 230 households in the street, in addition to raising one pig each, also jointly raise seventeen fattened pigs. On average, each woman has five chickens, and the family's expenses can be covered by the women. The First Street has 132 spinning wheels, spinning cotton tirelessly. A credit cooperative has also been organized in the city, and has now absorbed over 2 million in shares. Now, Qinyuan City's Victory Avenue has become a market.

### 在毛主席旗帜下翻了身　屯留上村劳动英雄　葛河堂发家致富

　　在毛主席旗帜下翻了身
  　屯留上村劳动英雄
  　葛河堂发家致富
    【本报太岳二十九日电】在共产党抚育下的屯留劳动英雄葛河堂发财致富。葛河堂原籍河南林县，逃难到屯留时，全部家产就只有一担米，而现在却有一百九十亩土地。（内有七十亩负担地，余皆新开荒地），九头牛、四头驴、四十口猪、九只羊、二十八只鸡；还栽了二百多棵果树，全部收入年达数百万元。除了全家十九口人都参加劳动，并雇有长工五人。今年老葛共种麦子六十亩、谷子八十亩、豆子二十二亩、玉茭十五亩、棉花一亩、山药蛋五亩、大麻南瓜各三亩，都做到精耕细作。除麦地外，都犁过三遍，平均每亩地上粪五十担，谷子、玉茭、棉花还有上至一百四十担的；估计今年可得好收成。
    老葛又是领导副业生产的能手，今春粉坊大利，买大猪六口，合冀钞十四万八千元；二辆大车往返沁源运输，赚冀钞一万五千元。去年又买到七间楼房，今年后半年还可下五窝猪娃，孵小鸡三窝，生两只小羊。全家妇女有七个人会纺花，四个人会织布，今春共纺线一百四十斤，织布二百二十丈，并且纺织质量都比一般的好。今春纺织了二十三斤半军布，是全村的头等布。
    老葛领导全家生产的唯一办法，是发扬民主，鼓励大家的积极性，每逢一个生产季节到来，都要召开家庭会议、布置讨论，分工做活。今春耕种完毕，他并且总结奖励了大家。如奖给了大侄儿手巾一条、单衣一套，侄女每人顶针一个、手巾一条，二侄儿媳妇衫子一件，老葛女人衫子一件，更加提高了大家的情绪。他对于雇工特别优待，粉坊大师傅崔正齐，一年赚工资麦子和小米十七石，并且允许他抽空种地四亩，收入归他自己使用。
    老葛不仅领导全家生产，并且还是全村生产的组织领导者。上村是三十二个小庄组成一个行政村，非常分散，老葛和干部共同努力，组织起男互助组十三个，包括全半劳力七十三人；妇女互助组五个，二十二人。还培养了张王中、党米二等领导骨干多人。
    老葛又是拥军优抗的模范，仅他一家即代耕了王恭、李孟虎等九家军属的土地，还给他们织布一百丈，不要工资，借给八家军属三十石粮食、十斤棉花、二十斤粉条、七斤粉皮，还有冀钞一万元，帮助他们买了牲口，娶了媳妇，开了油坊。今春已做军鞋六双，次慰劳军队冀钞五万四千元，粉条四百斤。
    他住的村庄很小，不能设立学校，老葛就把邻居的两个儿童和自己的三个侄儿集中一块，请了一个教员；除吃的米由五个学生共出以外，其余的油盐菜等都由老葛负责。
    因为老葛是贫苦出身，现在虽然这样富裕，但仍时时注意省吃节俭，今春他看见缺雨，便开始防旱备荒，从二月起便掺糠吃菜，到五月共节约小米二百七十斤，食盐一百零八两，白面一百八十斤。
    【本报太岳二十九日电】在抗日战争中，以围困敌人闻名全国的沁源城关人民，自光复回城后，在共产党领导下，已使沁源城呈现一片新气象。该城解放时已被日寇毁成一片焦土，仅余三间破房，城周四野田园荒芜，群众生计全无着落。经共产党批准了农民要求，实行土地改革，今春又开展大生产运动，第二街一百五十个妇女已有纺车九十三辆，今春已纺织六百五十六斤棉花，全街穿衣自给。全街二百三十余户，除每户喂一口猪外，还伙喂十七口肥猪。平均一个妇女有五只鸡，全家化费可由妇女供给。第一街有一百三十二辆纺车，不停息的纺花。全城并组织信用贷款合作社，现已吸收股金二百余万元。现在沁源城胜利大街已成集市。
