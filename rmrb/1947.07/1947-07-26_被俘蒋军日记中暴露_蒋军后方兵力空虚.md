Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 17th: The diary of Li Xi, deputy regimental commander of the 28th Regiment of the 10th Brigade of the 14th Division of the Chiang Army, captured in the Linfen Battle in Southern Shanxi, exposed the embarrassing situation of the Chiang Army's rear guard being empty and stretched thin. The division was originally a Chongqing garrison force. When a part of the Central Plains People's Liberation Army advanced into the border areas of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Hubei last year, it was hurriedly transferred, first to eastern Sichuan and then to southern Shaanxi to intercept the PLA. The diary stated that at that time, the Central Plains PLA had a large momentum, and one route advancing to the south bank of the Yangtze River reached thousands of people. However, the division was responsible for more than 20 counties and could not complete its task. The division commander was reprimanded by Chiang Kai-shek. In late March, when Chiang Kai-shek's and Hu Zongnan's troops attacked Yan'an, a part of the division was transferred to the Xi'an area for defense, but there were loopholes everywhere, and it was impossible to defend against everything. On March 26, Hu Zongnan ordered the division to go to Lintong, on the 27th to go to Sanqiao Town in Xi'an, and on the 28th to change the order to go to Xianyang. The division was "dismembered" and torn apart. As a result, the unit only stationed one regiment in eight counties from Xianyang to Luochuan, which was the so-called "Xianyu Southern Section Traffic Police Headquarters." The diary expressed anger at this kind of constantly changing orders: "The orders of this division have been changed repeatedly in the past three days. This is enough to show the hesitation and indecision of the superior officers in handling the troops. If this happens during the war, it will be extremely dangerous and may even affect the entire defeat of the army." In April, the troops of General Chen Geng of the People's Liberation Army launched a strong offensive in southern Shanxi. The 28th Regiment finally crossed the river to reinforce under Hu Zongnan's chaotic orders and was completely annihilated. Li also quoted in his diary Chen Cheng's training words to Hu Zongnan's troops: "Discipline is lax, there is no vigor. If you do not rectify, not only will there be no usable soldiers in the future, but I am afraid there will be no usable people!" This is a true reflection of the current situation of the Chiang Army.

　　被俘蒋军日记中暴露
  　蒋军后方兵力空虚
    【新华社晋南十七日电】晋南临晋之战，缴获之蒋军十四师十旅二十八团副团长李喜日记。暴露了蒋军后方兵力空虚，捉襟见肘之窘态。该师原为重庆警备部队，去年中原解放军一部挺进川陕鄂边时，仓惶被调出，初在川东，后在陕南堵击。日记中称当时中原解放军声势浩大，挺进长江南岸之一路即达数千人，而该师负担达二十余县，无法完成任务，该师师长遭受蒋介石训斥。三月下旬蒋胡军进攻延安，该师一部调赴西安一带防守，亦处处漏洞，防不胜防。三月二十六日，胡宗南电令该师开赴临潼，二十七日又要开赴西安三桥镇，廿八日再改令开往咸阳，该师被“五马分尸”，拆得七零八落。结果该部仅以一个团驻守咸阳至洛川八个县城，即所谓“咸榆南段交警司令部”。日记中对此种朝令夕改愤然说：“此三日来本师命令一再变更，此乃足可见上级长官处理部队之犹疑无决心，倘临战时，此则极为危险，甚至于可影响军队之整个败亡。”四月解放军陈赓将军所部发动晋南强大攻势，二十八团终于在胡宗南乱令下渡河增援，全部被歼。李在日记中并引有“陈诚对胡宗南部之训词：“纪律废弛，毫无朝气，如不振饬，将来不但无可用之兵，恐亦无可用之民矣！”实为蒋军现状之写照。
