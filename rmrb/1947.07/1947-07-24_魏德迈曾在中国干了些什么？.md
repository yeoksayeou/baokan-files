　　What Did Wedemeyer Do in China?
    Wedemeyer is a notorious figure among the Chinese people. He was welcomed by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries and favored by the American reactionaries for his insane interference in China's internal affairs. In October 1944, Wedemeyer was sent to China to replace Stilwell as the commander of the U.S. military in the China Theater and Chiang Kai-shek's chief of staff. He immediately became an accomplice of Hurley, actively implementing the policy of "only aiding the Kuomintang and not cooperating with the Communist Party," unilaterally supporting Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial regime. This policy hindered the internal unity of China and caused the ongoing negotiations on the establishment of a coalition government between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to fail again, thereby weakening China's war of resistance. Before the Japanese surrendered, Wedemeyer equipped 20 American-equipped divisions for Chiang Kai-shek. The vast majority of these troops were retained as capital for anti-communism. Wedemeyer also took the opportunity to insert a large number of American officers (cadre teams) into the leadership organizations of the Kuomintang army at all levels in order to achieve the goal of actually controlling the Kuomintang army.
    As soon as the Japanese surrendered, Wedemeyer organized what he believed to be "perhaps the largest airlift and sealift in history," rushing these "Americanized" Chiang troops and even more Chiang troops to the large cities in Central and North China surrounded by the People's Liberation Army, so that they could carry out the anti-communist civil war. Facts have proved that Wedemeyer was the one who ignited the Chinese civil war. In the words of an American soldier: Wedemeyer arranged everything for the Kuomintang's anti-people civil war, "leaving only the actual pulling of the trigger to the Kuomintang soldiers." (See "China Edition of the Stars and Stripes," November 22, 1945)
    The American "Nation" magazine once published an article saying that when Japan surrendered, "a fundamental solution to the China problem could have been produced if the Kuomintang leaders had not unexpectedly received American military aid. Wedemeyer and Hurley made several clear promises of American assistance to them. Having obtained the guarantee of American support, the Kuomintang warlords did not hesitate to plunge China into civil war." Here, the secret of why China could not achieve peace at that time and why the civil war could break out so quickly is made very clear. The role played by Wedemeyer and Hurley in China, as the American journalist White said, was as the "unified strategic engineers" who manufactured the Chinese civil war.
    At the same time, Wedemeyer, in his capacity as the commander of the U.S. military in the China Theater, commanded a large number of American troops transferred from across the distant Pacific Ocean to directly assist Chiang Kai-shek's army in the civil war that was slaughtering the Chinese people. According to what Truman disclosed in his statement on China last December, there were as many as 113,000 American troops in China at that time. These American troops seized strategic locations and handed them over to Chiang Kai-shek, guarded internal war communications, and even directly cooperated with Chiang's army to attack the liberated areas. Chiang's army entered Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Qinhuangdao, Huludao, and other places after the U.S. military first occupied them and then protected Chiang's army's entry. Moreover, some places like Qinhuangdao were forcibly occupied by the U.S. military from the People's Liberation Army. The U.S. Navy openly forced the CCP troops to withdraw from Yantai with an ultimatum, in a vain attempt to occupy this sacred city of the people. According to incomplete statistics, during Wedemeyer's stay in China, the U.S. military independently or led Chiang Kai-shek's army in attacks on the liberated areas a total of 30 times (31 times including the attack on Anping in July 1946), including attacks on Shanhaiguan, Beidaihe Railway Station, Haiyang Town, and the shelling of Lulong villages in eastern Hebei. The American Afternoon News disclosed at the time that when Japan surrendered, Wedemeyer quickly negotiated with Chiang Kai-shek a plan for the U.S. military to assist Chiang Kai-shek in seizing major cities. At that time, this plan even included Manchuria. Wedemeyer publicly declared in Shanghai: "The U.S. military may advance towards the communist army." He described the U.S. military's attack on Shanhaiguan as "sightseeing on the Great Wall," saying that this action "should not be interfered with" (both from a speech in Shanghai on November 8, 1945), and said that "if the U.S. military is shot at, they will return fire" (speech in September of the same year). He also threatened with the large-scale participation of the U.S. military in Chiang Kai-shek's civil war, saying: "If the Communists fire on Americans, the U.S. military will take military action against the Communists in North China." (Speech in Shanghai on November 16, 1945) Arrogant, shameless, and violently imperialistic airs are fully displayed here.
    After Marshall came to China and Hurley left, Wedemeyer remained in China, continuing to equip and transport Kuomintang troops, making the civil war in North China and Northeast China even more widespread. Whenever the Kuomintang army in the Northeast was hindered in its offensive, Wedemeyer actively advocated that "more government troops must be transported to Manchuria." (Wedemeyer's speeches on December 27, 1945, and March 19, 1946) By the time Wedemeyer left China last April, he had transported at least 14 armies, or more than 400,000 troops, to the front lines of the civil war in North China and Northeast China for the Kuomintang. Wedemeyer confessed that in the initial period of Japan's surrender, he transported 140,000 people for the Kuomintang through air transport alone. As for the work of equipping and training 45 divisions of the Kuomintang army under Wedemeyer's direct supervision, it was nearing completion when he left China. The natural result of this transportation and equipment work was Chiang Kai-shek's complete tearing up of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and the outbreak of the full-scale civil war in July. This is the real work of American imperialism under the guise of its "peace envoy" Marshall's "mediation."
    In the year and a half that Wedemeyer stayed in China, all he did was plunge China into the blood sea of civil war, and he was therefore favored by the American reactionaries. Now, when Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous dictatorial rule is in a deep crisis, this American executioner who aided Chiang and invaded China has come to China again as Truman's special representative. Undoubtedly, the Chinese people will greet him with an even stronger struggle against American imperialism and its Chinese lackeys. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 魏德迈曾在中国干了些什么？

　　魏德迈曾在中国干了些什么？
    魏德迈在中国人民中间是一个臭名昭著的人物，他曾以其疯狂干涉中国内政的行为，受到蒋介石反动派的欢迎，及美国反动派的宠爱。一九四四年十月，魏德迈被派来中国代替史迪威担任中国战区美军司令官及蒋介石的参谋长，他即成为赫尔利的同谋者，积极执行“只援助国民党，不与共产党合作”的片面支持蒋介石独裁政权的政策。这个政策妨碍了中国内部的团结，使当时正进行着的关于成立联合政府的国共谈判再度归于失败，从而削弱了中国的抗战。在日寇投降前，魏德迈为蒋介石装备了二十个美械师，这些部队绝大部分皆被当作反共的资本保留下来。魏德迈并乘机把大批美国军官（干部队）安插到国民党军各级领导机构中，以达其实际控制国民党军队之目的。
    日寇刚一投降，魏德迈即组织了他自认为他“相信此为历史上最大一次的空运和海运”，赶着把这些“美”化蒋军以及另外更多的蒋家军队运到华中和华北为人民解放军所包围的大城市，以便他们去进行反共内战。事实证明，魏德迈是中国内战的点火人。用一个美国士兵的话来说：魏德迈为国民党的反人民内战布置好了一切，“只把实际扳开枪机一件事留给国民党的士兵干。”（见一九四五年十一月二十二日“花旗报中国版”）
    美国“民族周刊”曾载文说：日本投降时，“中国问题的根本解决原是可以产生的，如果国民党领袖没有意外获得美国军事援助的话。魏德迈和赫尔利几次明白答应美国帮助他们，国民党军阀得到了美国支持之保证，就毫不踌躇地使中国陷于内战之中了。”这里将中国当时为什么不能获得和平以及内战得以迅速发生的秘密，讲得再明白不过了。魏德迈和赫尔利在中国担任的角色，一如美记者白修德所说的，乃是制造中国内战的“统一战略工程师”。
    同时，魏德迈以其身为中国战区美军司令的资格，指挥那从遥远的太平洋彼岸调来的大批美国军队，在屠杀中国人民的内战中直接协助蒋介石军。据去年十二月杜鲁门对华声明中所披露者，当时来华美军竟多至十一万三千人。这些美军抢占战略要地交给蒋介石，护守内战交通，甚至直接协同蒋军向解放区进攻。蒋军进入北平、天津、青岛、秦皇岛、葫芦岛等地，都是美军先加以占领，然后保护蒋军进入的。且其中象秦皇岛等地，是美军从人民解放军手中强行占领的。美海军曾公然以最后通牒强迫中共部队退出烟台，妄图占领这一神圣的人民城市。据不完全统计，魏德迈在华期间，美军单独或率领蒋介石军向解放区进攻事件共达三十次（与四六年七月进攻安平事件合计则为三十一次），其中包括进攻山海关、北戴河车站、海阳镇及炮轰冀东卢龙乡村等在内。美国下午报当时披露：魏德迈在日本投降时，很快与蒋介石商定了美军协助蒋介石抢占各大城市的计划，当时这个计划甚至包括满洲在内。魏德迈曾在上海公开宣称：“美军可能向着共产党军队前进。”他把美军进攻山海关说成“去长城观光”，说此项行动“不容有所干涉”（均见四五年十一月八日在沪谈话），说“美军如遭射击，则他们将开枪回击”（同年九月谈话）。并以美军大规模加入蒋介石内战为威胁说：“如果共产党对美国人开枪，则美军将对华北共产党采取军事行动。”（四五年十一月十六日在沪谈话）傲慢无耻与荒暴的帝国主义神气，在这里表现得十足。
    马歇尔来华及赫尔利离开以后，魏德迈依然留在中国，继续着装备和运输国民党军队的工作，使华北和东北的内战更加扩大起来。每当东北国民党军进攻受阻时，魏德迈便积极主张“必须运更多的政府军到满洲去。”（魏氏四五年十二月二十七日及四六年三月十九日谈话）截至魏德迈去年四月离华前，他至少为国民党运送了十四个军四十多万人的兵力到华北和东北内战前线去。魏德迈自供他在日寇投降的最初时间里，仅空运一项即为国民党运输了十四万人。至于魏德迈直接主持下所进行的装备和训练国民党军四十五个师的工作，在他离华时已接近完成。此次运输和装备工作的自然结果，就是蒋介石将政协决议的全部撕破和七月全面内战的爆发。这也就是美国帝国主义在其“和平特使”马歇尔“调解”外衣掩护下的真正工作。
    魏德迈在其留华一年半的时间内，他所做的全部工作就是把中国抛到内战的血海之中，他就是因此而获得美国反动派的爱宠。现在当蒋介石卖国独裁统治陷于深刻危机之际，这个美国援蒋侵华的刽子手又作为杜鲁门特别代表到中国来了。无疑的，中国人民将以更加加强反对美国帝国主义及其中国走狗的斗争来接待他。（新华社）
