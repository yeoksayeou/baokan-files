　　Everyone Eagerly Watches the Communist Party
  　Party Members in the Ninth District of She County Publicly Report Merits
    [Our Newspaper, She County News] In order to allow the masses to further understand the Communist Party's achievements in struggle, the Ninth District held a mass meeting of more than 700 people at dusk on the 28th of last month, allowing model cadres and party members to report their merits. First, Comrade Wang Zhuting, a model party member from Shangqingliang, reported. The masses under the stage naturally squeezed together to listen carefully to the conversation on the stage. When he talked about struggling against the landlord in the village, three old men in the back held hands and kept squeezing forward, using their hands to push aside the taller comrades in front, saying, "You're the only ones watching; let us see the Communist Party too." When Wang Quan, another model party member from Shangqingliang, reported, an old man from Shangqingliang, afraid that he couldn't see, stood on a stone and said to his companion, "When people talk about struggling against the landlord, they really put in a lot of effort. Only now do I know that it was the Communist Party that led us to turn over!" Then the model cadres from Zhongyuan Village also began to talk, especially when he talked about fighting against special agent sabotage without sleeping at night. A young man said with emotion, "What he said is right. Our village was instigated by special agents to become disunited and unable to work. Thinking about it, we should thoroughly eliminate them." Then slogans such as "Support the Chinese Communist Party!" and "The Communist Party is our savior!" shook the entire meeting. After the public report of merits, the slogan "It is truly glorious to be a Communist Party member" has already become a mass slogan. (Zhisheng, Wenbin, Huafeng)

　　人人争看共产党
  　涉县九区党员公开表功
    【本报涉县讯】九区为了让群众更进一步的认识共产党的斗争成绩，特于上月廿八日黄昏，在七百多人的群众大会上，让模范干部党员进行表功。首先由上清凉模范党员王竹亭同志报告，台下的群众自然的都挤在一块细听台上的谈话，当他谈到在村里向地主斗争时，后边三个老汉拉着手一直往前挤，并用手拨开前面高个同志说：“光您看啦，叫俺也看看共产党吧。”到另一位上清凉模范党员王全报告时，上清凉一个老百姓怕自己看不见便站在一个石头上，并对他相跟来的同伴说：“人家说起斗争地主来，真是出了大力气啦，这才知道就是共产党领导咱翻身哩！”接着中原村模范干部也谈起来，特别是他谈到黑夜不睡向特务破坏进行斗争时，一个青年感动的说：“人家说的就是对，俺村被特务挑拨弄的不团结，不能工作，想起来真该彻底消灭它。”接着“拥护中国共产党”！“共产党是我们的救命人”！等口号震动了全会场。经过表功“共产党员真光荣”的口号已经是群众性的口号了。（志胜、文彬、华峰）
