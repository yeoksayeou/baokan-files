　　Military Region Directly Subordinate Units
  　Help Plant 1,600 Mu
    [Our Newspaper] Just as the Liu-Deng counter-offensive army captured Yuncheng and the good news of annihilating over ten thousand enemies arrived – on the afternoon of the ninth, it rained again, much to the joy of the military and civilians, who rushed to replant and plant. According to incomplete statistics from seven units, including the Directly Subordinate Unit's Political Department, 482 people (including ministers, directors, section chiefs, administrative staff, students, soldiers, guests, and prisoners) and 82 animals helped the masses with emergency planting, cultivating a total of 1,630 mu. Minister Zhang, returning from the Peace Hospital late at night in the rain, used the telephone to notify each unit, ordering them to stop all work that could be stopped and organize all animals to immediately assist with the emergency planting. When the Direct Work Section was helping the × widow plant corn, it was already past noon. The old woman repeatedly suggested returning to rest, but because there was not much left, Director Tang said, "Let's finish planting before we leave; it's three or four *li* back and forth." They continued to work for another hour or two until it was all done before returning home. After eating, they didn't even take a nap, but carried their hoes to help another soldier's family with emergency planting. To ensure that not a single mu was left uncultivated, they checked door to door. Comrade Daling discovered that a local villager's husband was away doing business and couldn't hire anyone, so he immediately organized ten or so people to help with the planting. (Meiling)

　　军区直属队
  　助种千六百亩
    【本报讯】正当刘邓反攻大军攻克郓城，歼敌万余捷音传来之日——九日下午，天又降喜雨，军民欢腾，补种抢种。据直属队司政等七个单位不完全统计，帮助群众抢种的计四百八十二人（包括部长、处长、科长、事务人员、学员、战士、客人、犯人等），牲口八十二匹，共抢种、补种一千六百三十亩。张部长深夜冒雨从和平医院回来，就用电话，一一通知各单位，停止一切可以停止的工作，组织所有牲口，即时帮助抢种。直工科在帮助×寡妇种玉茭时，天已过午，老百姓几次提出回来歇歇，因剩的不多，唐主任说：“种了再走吧，来回三四里地。”接着又干了个把钟头，直到全都干完才回家。吃过饭午觉也没睡，又背着锄头，帮助另一个抗属抢种，为作到不荒一亩地，挨户查问，大林同志发现一家老乡的男人在外做生意，雇不着人，马上组织十来个人帮助下了种。（梅岭）
