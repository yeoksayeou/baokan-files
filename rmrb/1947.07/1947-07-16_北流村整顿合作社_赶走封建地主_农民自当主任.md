    North Liu Village Rectifies Cooperative
    Drives Away Feudal Landlords
    Farmers Become Directors
    [Report from this newspaper in Licheng] Li Jia Kui, a Taihang first-class cooperative hero from North Liu Village, after studying the *Xinhua Daily*'s article "Squeezing Out Feudalism," first inspected the village cooperative and then went to the branch to inspect. He discovered that special agent landlords Li Daoshi and Li Ai Kui were still in charge of the cooperative. These people lived very well; the four of them spent 85,000 yuan on food in five months (the village's general cooperative only spent over 90,000 yuan for ten people in five months). They also ignored the needs of the masses, only buying foreign fine cloth and light sundries. Jia Kui suggested preparing some grain for famine relief, but Li Daoshi resisted passively, saying: The cooperative's place is too narrow to store grain. From the inspection, it was recognized that special agent landlords could not serve the masses and were wasteful and destructive. It was felt that the past perception that landlords could write, calculate, and had business acumen was wrong, and they resolved to work with cadres and shareholders to squeeze feudalism out of the cooperative. Duan Sixian said: "In the past, we worked for the landlords. Today, they put up the signboard of a cooperative, and we still have to farm for them. They are imposing and dignified in the cooperative." Everyone unanimously demanded that the farmers themselves be the directors. After discussion, six people were selected from among the farmers to manage the cooperative, and the feudal landlords were ordered to hand over their accounts and leave the cooperative quickly.

    北流村整顿合作社
    赶走封建地主
    农民自当主任
    【本报黎城讯】北流村太行一等合作英雄李甲魁，经过学习新华日报的挤封建一文，首先对本村合作社作检查，又到分社检查，查出特务地主李道士、李爱魁，仍在合作社负主要责任，这些人在生活上很好，五个月四人伙食支了八万五千元（本村总社五个月十人才支了九万余元），也不管群众需要，光买外来细布轻便杂货，甲魁提出叫准备些粮食渡荒，李道士消极抵抗说：合作社地方窄不能囤粮。从检查中认识了特务地主不能为群众服务，且浪费破坏。感到过去认为地主能写算有经营常识的认识是错误的，决心和干部股员把封建挤出社外。段四贤说：“过去是咱给地主劳动，今天人家打上合作社招牌，咱还得给人家种地，他倒在合作社威风体面。”大家一致要求农民自己来作主任，经过讨论，在农民中选出六人来管理合作社，叫封建地主迅速交账离社。
