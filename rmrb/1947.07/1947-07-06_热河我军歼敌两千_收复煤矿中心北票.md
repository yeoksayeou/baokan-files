Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 4th. Following the recovery of Chaoyang, the Rehe People's Liberation Army, after six days and nights of fierce fighting, captured Beipiao, a coal mining center on the Jinzhou-Chengde railway branch line, on the evening of the 1st, completely annihilating a defending enemy regiment and part of the puppet bandits. More than 3,000 enemies who fled east from Chaoyang rushed across the Daling River on the 30th to reinforce the north. They were intercepted by our forces in the mountainous area south of Beipiao. Upon contact, the enemy fled in panic across the river to the southeast. According to preliminary statistics, more than 2,000 enemies, including a deputy regimental commander and a political director, were captured. The captured materiel included two mountain guns, two heavy mortars, three rocket launchers, seven 60mm mortars, twenty-eight light and heavy machine guns, more than eight hundred rifles, three radio stations, three locomotives, and many other supplies. Note: Beipiao is the forty-third city recovered by us in the Northeast Summer Offensive.
