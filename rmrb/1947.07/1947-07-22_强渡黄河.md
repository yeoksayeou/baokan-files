　　Forcibly Crossing the Yellow River
　　Hu Zheng

　　The night of June 30th was the 11th day of the fifth lunar month, the moon was bright. Liu Bocheng's army corps, the heroic ×× Brigade, swiftly crossed villages in the silent plain, advancing towards the bank of the Yellow River.

　　A row of artillery pieces was set up on the embankment. In the river defense headquarters sat Staff Officer Yan of the No. 54 Unit of the ×× Brigade. Through his binoculars, the enemy's sentries on the opposite bank were fearfully wriggling like insects in the sand. Along the bank, there was a pillbox every fifty meters, and a single-person trench every fifteen meters. Connecting the pillboxes and trenches was a two-foot-wide trench. In front of this trench roared the Yellow River, which Chiang Kai-shek boasted was defended by "four hundred thousand troops" – turbulent waves.

　　Young General Xiao Yongyin smoked in the fortifications of the river defense headquarters, watching the time. When the short hand pointed to 10:30, he used the telephone to notify the No. 53 Unit behind him: arrive at the riverbank within five minutes. At 10:34, the assault team of the No. 53 Unit arrived. Each unit and each person of these heroes came with their own plan to earn merit. During the mobilization in the daytime, General Xiao Yongyin's requirement of them was: occupy the communication trench, consolidate the front line, and as long as you hold on for half an hour, the second echelon will arrive. But the No. 53 Unit's plan was to occupy the river embankment on the opposite bank within half an hour. Their Second Squad planned to occupy Dongyugu and Yingli Village, and the First Platoon Deputy Li Xiangyun of the Second Squad, fearing that others would snatch his enemies, was the first to put forward his own requirements and plan: "I want to take a squad, take the first boat, I will be the first to board, the first to disembark, the first to land, the first to occupy the pillbox and Dongyugu, the first to occupy the碉堡 on the river embankment…….”

　　Not only were our troops' plans scientific and thorough, but other participating departments were also fully prepared. The counter-offensive shoes were taken out and used long ago.………

　　Here we should especially remember one thing: the boatmen at the crossing, the heroes on the water, were as brave and miraculous as the troops. Their plans were as scientific and thorough as the troops'. All the boatmen ××× people squeezed onto the "Dare-to-Die Team" list. They declared, "For the total liberation of the people of the whole country, we will use all our strength to quickly ferry the counter-offensive army corps to the other side." And put forward: "Do not disembark until the mission is completed". ×× small boats, ×× large boats, forming four detachments, ten groups, each group demanded to be the vanguard. Two-thirds of them had played boats ten years ago. Since the Yellow River changed its course, they had not done this for more than ten years. Ten years ago, the river was narrower than it is now, and a small boat took half an hour to go back and forth. After a short period of training this time, it has been shortened by twenty minutes. This evening, they themselves proposed that it would only take thirteen minutes, but in fact, they surpassed this plan even more, taking only twelve minutes to go back and forth!

　　At this time, it was 10:36. After a brief meeting between commanders at all levels, the boats were all arranged at the crossing, everything was done in silence, without even the sound of coughing. Boat Management Section Chief Chen Shangchao and Battalion Commander Jia Xiushan used hand gestures to direct the position of each boat. The troops walked out of the trenches and walked to the渡口, Li Xiangyun, the first platoon deputy of the No. 53 Unit’s second squad, came according to plan. He led thirteen people and a machine gun, lightly stepping onto the small boat according to the place designated by the boat captain. This was Nie Yanjin's speedboat, the No. 1 assault boat. After placing the machine gun on the bow of the boat, Li Xiangyun and Nie Yanjin said something softly, waved their hands, sat down, and the boat started.

　　When Nie Yanjin moved the second paddle, the second, third………boats were all full of people, at this time the moon rose to the top of the sky, and the sound of the water covered all sounds. The shadow of the boat on the luminous water, like a relief, drew a long line. People's excited eyes stared at the opposite bank of the river, everyone's heart was beating nervously, sweat slipped from their faces to their necks. The heroes on the water stripped naked, waving the twenty-pound long oar, the powerful blue veins on their arms flashed in the bright moonlight. A gust of wind swept across the woods behind the river, sending the waves towards the diagonally opposite bank, and the oar-wielding heroes spread their wings, riding the wind and waves, rushing towards the diagonally opposite bank……

　　The width of the river is two li, and the 45-degree oblique crossing line must be at least half a li longer. The first boat reached the center of the river three minutes after leaving the shore. At this time, the enemy on the opposite bank shouted: "Here they come, here they come, quickly report……", as soon as the voice fell, a burst of machine gun fire came over. Li Xiangyun's machine gun immediately fired back, so the machine guns of all the boats sounded. As soon as the machine guns sounded, Staff Officer Yan issued the order on this bank of the river: "Fire!" So ×× cannons fired in unison, spitting red fire, and the pillboxes and fortresses on the opposite bank suddenly burst into flames several feet high in the earth-shattering roar, and the sand on the bank rustled and fell into the water.

　　After five minutes of bombardment, the night completely changed, the clouds quickly flew to the southeast, the moon was higher and brighter, the enemy's gunfire suddenly moved away, and then quickly stopped. At this time, Nie Yanjin's boat was the first to reach the shore, Li Xiangyun was the first to jump down, leading the entire squad to be the first to land. Then he pounced over the trench, occupied the pillbox, and then chased southeast. All the heroes of the Second Squad and the Third Squad followed and ran across the muddy area, rushing towards the black woods twenty miles away.

　　They occupied Yugu Village, which was the stronghold of a battalion of the 543rd Regiment of Mi Wenhe of the enemy's 55th Division. The regimental commander's surname was Kou, and he had accepted Chiang Kai-shek's face-to-face instructions at twelve o'clock that morning and rushed from Nanjing. And he ran away less than eleven hours after taking office, and before leaving, he used carts to drag away forty-six corpses.

　　After the People's Liberation Army soldiers arrived in the village, they did not stop and chased towards the river embankment. The time was exactly 10:48, only seven minutes after boarding the boat. The first bugle call was issued from the dark woods on the east bank of the river. This was a signal that the vanguard had occupied the river embankment and the pillboxes on the embankment. Following this sound, the People's Liberation Army on the west bank was full of渡口, making loud noises and applause to welcome the large fleet of the second ferry.

　　In the two hours before dawn, General Xiao Yongyin and all the reserves appeared on the high embankment on the east bank of the river. The young general squatted on the embankment, spread out a map, and used a flashlight to find traces of the enemy, and then issued an emergency order to the various troops: "Chase!"………

　　强渡黄河
    胡征
    六月三十日夜晚，是旧历五月十一，月亮正明。刘伯承的兵团，英雄的××旅，在静寂的平原上迅速地越过一个个村庄，向黄河岸挺进。
    一列大炮，架在堤岸上。河防指挥部里，坐着××旅五四部队的颜参谋长。在他的望远镜里，对岸敌人的哨兵，象虫子一样在沙滩上畏怯地蠕动着。沿岸的防线，五十米一个暗堡，十五米一个单人掩体，暗堡与掩体之间，是一条二尺宽的壕沟联系着，这条沟面前淘淘奔腾的，便是蒋介石所吹嘘的“四十万大军”——浊浪翻卷的黄河。
    年青的萧永银将军在河防指挥部的工事里抽着烟，看着表。短针指到十点半的时候，他用电话通知背后的五三部队：五分钟内到达河沿。十点三十四分钟，五三部的突击队就到了。这些英雄们每一单位每一人，都是带着自己的立功计划来的。白天动员的时候，萧永银将军对他们的要求是：占领交通沟、巩固前沿，只要坚持半点钟，第二梯队就到了。而五三部的计划却是要在半点钟内占领对岸河堤。他们的二小队计划占领东于谷和营里村，三小队计划夺取河堤上的碉堡，二小队一排副李祥云怕别人抢去自己的敌人似的，最先提出自己的要求和计划：“我要带一个班，坐第一只船，我头一个上船，头一个下船，头一个登陆，头一个占领暗堡和东于谷，头一个占领河堤上的碉堡……。”
    不仅我们部队的计划是科学而周密的，就是其他各个参战的部门都一样有了充分的准备。反攻面，反攻鞋都早拿出来，用起来了。………
    这里我们应该特别记着一件事，渡口的船夫，水上的英雄们，和部队是一样的英勇与神奇，他们的计划和部队一样的科学与周密，全体水手×××人都挤上了“奋勇队”的名单，他们申言着：“为了全国老百姓的总翻身，要用一切力量，把大反攻的兵团，迅速地摆渡到对岸去。”并提出：“不完成任务不下船”。××只小划子，××只大船，组成四个分队，十个小组，每一个小组都要求当先锋。他们中间三分之二是十年前玩过船的，自黄河改道以后，十来年没搞过这玩意儿了。十年前，河面比现在窄，小划子每次来回需半点钟的时间。这次经过短期训练以后，已缩短二十分钟了。这天晚上，他们自己提出只要十三分钟，但在事实上，他们却更高地超过了这计划，来回只用十二分钟！
    这时候，正是十点三十六分。各级指挥员简单地接头以后，船只都在渡口上摆好了，一切都在静寂中进行，连咳嗽的声音也没有。船只管理股长陈尚超和大队长贾秀山，用手式指挥着各船的位置。部队走出壕沟，走到渡口，五三部二小队一排副李祥云按着计划走来了。他带领十三个人和一挺机枪，顺着船长指定的地方轻快地跨上小划子，这是聂言金的快艇，第一号冲锋船。把机枪架在船头上以后，李祥云和聂言金轻轻地说了一句什么，手一摆，坐下去，船就开动了。
    当聂言金拨动第二桨时，第二号、三号………各小划和大船上的人都上满了，这时候月亮升到顶空，水声掩盖了一切声音。船的影子在放光的水面上，象浮雕一样，画着一条长线。人们兴奋的眼睛盯着河对岸，每个人的心都紧张的跳着，汗从脸上溜到脖子上。水上的英雄赤裸着全身，摇起二十斤的长桨，胳脖上有力的青筋在明亮的月光中闪动。河背后的树林扫过一阵大风，把波浪往斜对岸播送，摇桨的英雄象展开了翅膀，乘风破浪，往斜对岸迅速地飞驰……。
    河的宽度是二华里，而四十五度的斜渡线，起码要加长了半里。第一只船离岸三分钟已到河心，这时候对岸敌人叫了一声：“来了来了，快去报告………”，话声刚落，一阵机枪打过来。李祥云的机枪随即打了过去，于是各船的机枪都响了。机枪声一起，颜参谋长在河这岸发出了口令：“开炮！”于是××门大炮口吐着红火齐声轰击过去，对岸的碉堡要塞在这惊天动地的轰响中，突然冒起几丈高的大火，岸边的沙土哗哗地震落到水里。
    经过五分钟的轰击，夜色全变了，云彩迅速地向东南飞去，月亮更高更亮了，敌人的枪声忽然远了，而又很快地停息了。这时候聂言金的船，第一个抵岸，李祥云第一个跳下去，带领全班第一个登陆。于是扑过壕沟，占领暗堡，再向东南追赶过去，二小队、三小队的全体英雄跟着跑过泥巴地带，向二十里外黑色的树林冲过去。
    他们占领了于谷村，这是敌人五十五师，米文和的五四三团一个营的据点。团长姓寇，是这天上午接受了蒋介石的面谕十二点钟从南京赶来的。而他刚到任不到十一个钟头就逃跑了，临走，用大车拖走了四十六具死尸。
    解放军战士到村以后，没有停顿就往河堤那边追赶。时间正是十点四十八分，离上船只七分钟，从河东岸黑黑的树林里面发出了第一次号声，这是先头部队已占领河堤及堤上碉堡的信号。接着这声音，西岸的人民解放军已站满渡口，发出大笑大叫和拍手的声音，迎接第二次摆渡的大船队。
    在黎明前的两小时，萧永银将军和所有的后备队都出现在河东的高堤上。年青的将军蹲在堤上展开地图，用手电筒照着寻找敌人的踪迹，然后向各部队发出紧急命令：“追！”………
