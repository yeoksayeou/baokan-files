    County Head Personally Inspects Villages; Qinshui County Rectifies Mutual Aid
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 14th] Recently, Qinshui discovered that many mutual aid groups had collapsed. County Head Nan Jisun personally led three inspection teams to conduct thorough inspections in various villages. After inspecting the mutual aid brigades of An Hongshan in Longtou, Wang Jinzhu in Pipa Garden, and Cao Xianliang in Shangxingju, it was found that the main reason for their failure to consolidate was the general lack of understanding of organization among the leaders, who believed that mutual aid was simply for crash planting and weeding, or for supporting the war effort. There was insufficient publicity among the masses about mutual aid and cooperation leading to prosperity. Therefore, the leadership adopted a "grab-and-release" approach (organizing when the work was tight and relaxing when the work was slack). In addition, there was insufficient cultivation of core members. For example, after Wang Jinzhu of the Wang Jinzhu Mutual Aid Brigade returned to his hometown in Hebei, there was no one to lead it again. After An Hongshan of Longtou joined the army, there was no suitable person to replace him. In some places, the mutual aid group existed when the cadre was present, and disbanded when the cadre left. Finally, the leadership failed to promptly resolve the problems that occurred in mutual aid, leading to unchecked development. For example, during the spring plowing last year in the Cao Xianliang Mutual Aid Brigade, the general wage was five liters of rice, but the mutual aid group only stipulated three liters, benefiting those who used labor and disadvantaging those who provided labor. As for general mutual aid groups, there were too many "model actions," focusing only on helping the families of soldiers by farming for them, which often led to collapse. This inspection has drawn great attention from the leadership. Currently, each village is solving problems in mutual aid groups by clearing old debts and paying attention to the cultivation of core members, in order to consolidate the mutual aid groups. After rectification, 35 of the 48 administrative villages in the second and fifth districts have largely resolved their problems and have begun using a work-point system.
    [This newspaper dispatch] The sowing in the entire third district of Taihang has come to an end. The Special Commissioner's Office has issued instructions, calling on all localities to rectify mutual aid, pointing out that this year's production mutual aid movement was launched under extremely complex and difficult conditions of labor shortage due to participation in the war, transportation of grain, drought resistance, and rush planting. It was launched after repeated mobilization based on the idea that the masses should prosper together. Although there have been three years of organizational experience in the past, and many new creations this year, these experiences and creations have not yet been fully understood, grasped, and applied by all our masses. There are still many shortcomings in various aspects of mutual aid groups, such as democratic leadership, equal exchange of labor, conversion of labor, and dividend distribution. If we do not promptly pay attention to summarizing experience and clearing up problems, we will inevitably repeat the mistakes of the past, and the mutual aid will collapse after the movement. Therefore, it is necessary to:
    1. Promptly summarize the experiences of mutual aid and labor exchange, especially the new creations of the combination of agricultural and sideline production, war support, and war service. Through the masses, the past period of practice should be summarized and elevated a step further on specific issues, so that various labor exchanges, conversion of labor, and dividend distribution are more fair and reasonable, and the form of mutual aid is more suitable to the needs of the masses.
    2. Timely clear the mutual aid accounts, promote mutual assistance and mutual benefit, and avoid neglecting careful accounting. Over time, it will inevitably lead to contradictions due to taking advantage or suffering losses, affecting the consolidation and development of mutual aid.
    3. The wages of mutual aid groups, whether too high or too low, directly affect the development and consolidation of mutual aid. When the masses feel it is inappropriate, it should be determined through democratic discussion, opposing both stinginess and the promotion of unprincipled generosity, and ensuring mutual assistance, mutual benefit, and everyone benefiting.

### 县长亲自下乡检查  沁源各村整顿互助

    县长亲自下乡检查
    沁源各村整顿互助
    【本报太岳十四日电】沁源最近发现不少互助组垮台，南济荪县长亲带三个检查小组，深入各村检查。在检查了龙头安鸿山、琵琶园王金柱、上兴居曹显亮等互助大队后，发现其不能巩固的主要原因，表现在领导上普遍对组织起来的认识不足，认为互助就是单纯为了突击下种和锄苗，或者是为支差参战。在群众中宣传互助合作，由贫变富十分不够。因此在领导上就产生了抓一把的作风（活紧时就组织，活松时就又放松）。此外对培养骨干不够。如王金柱互助大队，在王金柱回了河北老家后，便再没有能领导起来的骨干，龙头在安鸿山参军后，也没适合的人来代替，还有的地方是干部在，互助组也在；干部走互助组也散。最后就是领导上对互助中所发生的问题，没有及时解决，形成自流。如曹显亮互助大队，去年春耕时一般工资是五升米，互助组只订了三升，用工的沾了便宜，出工的吃了亏。至于一般互助组“模范作用”太多，只注意帮助抗属代耕等，常形成垮台的重要原因。从这次检查中，已引起领导上的极大注意。现各村正从清理旧欠，和注意培养骨干，来解决互助组中的问题，以巩固互助组。二、五两区四十八个行政村经整顿后，已有三十五个村大部问题解决，并开始用工票制度。
    【本报讯】太行三专区全区下种已告结束，专署顷发指示，号召各地整顿互助，指出：今年的生产互助运动，是在参战运粮抗旱抢种劳力缺乏的极端复杂与困难条件下，经过反复动员，在群众要发一齐发的思想基础上轰起来的，虽有过去三年组织经验，和今年不少的新创造，但这些经验和创造还未被我们所有群众能全部领会和掌握运用。在互助组的民主领导等价变工折工分红各方面，还存在不少缺点，如不及时注意总结经验，清理问题，就必然会蹈过去覆辙，运动一过，互助垮台，因此必须：
    一、迅速总结互助变工经验，特别是农副战勤三大结合的新创造，要通过群众将以往一段的实践，从具体问题上把经验总结提高一步，使各种变工折工分红更公道合理，互助形式更适合群众要求。二、及时清理互助工账，发扬互助互利，忽视勤算账，时间一长，就必然会因吃亏沾便宜发生矛盾，影响互助的巩固发展。三、互助组的工资，过高过低都直接影响互助的发展与巩固，群众认为不适当时通过民主讨论确定，既反对鸡皮小肚，也不发扬无原则的涵厚，一定做到互助互利大家沾光。
