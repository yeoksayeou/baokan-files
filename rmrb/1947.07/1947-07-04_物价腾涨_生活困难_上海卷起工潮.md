　　Soaring Prices, Hardship
  　Shanghai Swept by Labor Unrest
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 1st] Shanghai News: A magnificent wave of labor unrest has recently swept through Shanghai again. From the beginning of June to date, according to incomplete statistics, workers from twelve major enterprises have participated in the labor unrest, including sock weaving, silk weaving, machinery, underwear, suits, lead printing, dyeing and weaving, machine sewing, civilian ships, leather shoes, knitting, and pen and ink industries. This labor unrest was triggered by soaring prices and difficult living conditions. On the 11th, a mass of male and female workers from the silk weaving industry participated in negotiations with the Social Bureau. The police bureau arrested seven workers' representatives from the industry, which aroused the workers' disturbance in the industry, who surrounded the police bureau. As the labor unrest developed, Jia Fengrong, chairman of the Sock Weaving Workers' Union, was kidnapped by special agents. On the 28th, more than 1,000 workers (mostly female workers) held a day-long demonstration in front of the municipal government, demanding the immediate release of Jia Fengrong. At the beginning of the labor unrest, the Chiang Kai-shek's Social Bureau issued an order strictly prohibiting the industry's workers from engaging in "strikes, slowdowns, and other behaviors during the period of 'labor-capital agreement or application for 'arbitration'"; the labor community expressed extreme indignation at this. The labor unrest is currently spreading and expanding.

　　物价腾涨·生活困难
  　上海卷起工潮
    【新华社陕北一日电】沪讯：上海最近又卷起壮阔工潮。自六月初旬迄今，参加工潮者据不完全统计：已有织袜、丝织、机器、内衣、西服、铅印、染织、机器缝纫、民船、皮鞋、针织、笔墨等共十二个重要企业单位之工人，此次工潮乃由于物价腾涨、生活困难所激起。十一日织丝业男女工人群众社会局参加谈判，警局竟捕去该业工，代表七名，因而激起该业工人之骚动，曾将警局加以包围。工潮发展中，织袜业工人联合会主席贾凤荣被特务绑架，二十八日一千余工人（大多数为女工）在市政府门前举行整日示威，要求立即释放贾凤荣。工潮初起时蒋记社会局竟下令严禁该业工人在“劳资协议或呈请‘公断’期间之罢工、怠工等行为”；劳工界对此极表愤慨，刻工潮正在蔓延扩大中。
