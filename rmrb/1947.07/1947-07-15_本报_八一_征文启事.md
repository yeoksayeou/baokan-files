Call for Contributions for the "August 1st" Special Issue of this Newspaper

"August 1st," the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, is approaching. The inspiring nationwide full-scale counter-offensive has begun in our area. This great festival should be warmly celebrated by all soldiers and civilians. The spirit of the Red Army, Eighth Route Army, and New Fourth Army in overcoming difficulties and fighting bravely from nothing to something, from small to large; the growth and expansion of the People's Liberation Army in military, political, and technical aspects during the year of the Patriotic Self-Defense War; and the emergence of many combat heroes and people's meritorious workers from the regular army, local armed forces, and militia; the people's participation in the army, war, production savings, and support for the front lines have also achieved great results, with many exemplary deeds. Only by everyone writing about them can these moving deeds be preserved. Therefore, we are soliciting contributions with the following content:

	I. Memoirs of combat life from veteran Red Army soldiers and commanders.
	II. Stories of the growth of outstanding heroes, model squads, platoons, companies... in various units.
	III. New creations in ideological education in the political work of the troops.
