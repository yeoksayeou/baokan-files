　　Xia County Battle作战有功
  　An Yi Independent Battalion受嘉奖
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 25th] The Taiyue Military Region Headquarters issued a circular on the 21st, commending the An Yi Independent Battalion for its meritorious service in coordinating the recovery of Xia County. The battalion coordinated in sweeping out peripheral strongholds, killing or wounding three enemy supervisors, capturing 18 enemy personnel including an enemy battalion commander, and seizing one machine gun and one telephone. The Xia County militia bravely pursued the enemy during their breakout, capturing 110 enemy soldiers and seizing one heavy machine gun, four light machine guns, and over 40 rifles.
    [This newspaper, Jinan Frontline, 23rd] During the battle to annihilate the enemy's 248th Regiment in Miaodi, Pinglu on July 12th, it has now been discovered that the regiment's deputy commander, Zeng Qiaoyun, was also captured at the same time and has been escorted to the Jinan Frontline Headquarters.
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 25th] The masses in the newly liberated areas of Jinan are both distributing land and arming themselves to protect the fruits of their liberation. In the first and second districts of Jilu County, after the Jinan campaign, some Kuomintang special agents and armed bandits still occasionally raided, threatening the peasant's liberation movement. The peasants urgently demanded to be armed to suppress the bandits. In villages such as Shangkuanyu, Dazhang, Hutou, and Diantou, 74 young people joined the militia during the land distribution struggle from the 11th to the 26th of last month, and captured over 50 bandits. In particular, the militia of Shangkuanyu repelled small groups of bandits several times, protecting the village's struggle. Since then, the fleeing stubborn pseudo-personnel have returned one after another and bowed their heads to the masses. According to statistics, a total of over 300 pseudo-stubborn personnel have registered with our government in half a month. After receiving land and property, the peasants of Yangguo Village actively organized armed forces. The peasant armed forces of the third district and other villages were formally established on the 10th of this month, and are conducting military training under the leadership of captains Wang Tinghuai and Wang Jincai.
