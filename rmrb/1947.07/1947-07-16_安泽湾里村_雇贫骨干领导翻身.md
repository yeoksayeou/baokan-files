Anze Wanli Village

Hiring Poor Peasants and Backbone Leaders to Overthrow Their Fate

[This newspaper, Taiyue, 14th dispatch] Anze Wanli Village has 270 households and 915 people. After the county town was liberated the year before last, a mass movement was carried out for a period of time. Because at that time it was based on problem liquidation, only those with problems could overthrow their fate. In addition, the leadership did not let go and did not delve into mountain villages, so some poor peasants and hired laborers did not overthrow their fate. This year, under the slogan of thoroughly overthrowing feudalism and realizing "land to the tiller," the leadership paid attention to going deep into the masses and discovered that three poor peasants and hired laborers, including Pei Jiufu, had not yet overthrown their fate. They mobilized them to participate in the movement. When they accepted the "land to the tiller" policy that one could overthrow their fate even without problems, they immediately contacted eleven poor people, forming the backbone of the movement. Led by them, they convened a village-wide meeting of poor peasants and hired laborers, publicized the "land to the tiller" policy, and inspired everyone to speak out about their sufferings. At this time, the leadership absorbed Guo Fu, Li Jiyou, and others from among these poor peasants and hired laborers to participate in the Standing Committee of the Peasants' Association, and publicly praised their achievements in fighting against feudal forces, enhancing their prestige. The distribution of fruits was also based on poor peasants and hired laborers as the backbone, fairly and reasonably filling the gaps. Currently, all seventeen poor peasants and hired laborers in the village have been fully mobilized, and five of them have become leading backbones.

    雇贫骨干领导翻身
    【本报太岳十四日电】安泽湾里村有二百七十户，九百一十五口人，前年县城解放后，曾进行过一段群众运动，因当时是以问题清算，有问题才能翻身，加上领导上不放手，亦未深入山庄小村，所以有些贫雇没有翻身。今年在彻底斗透封建，实现耕者有其田的口号下，领导上注意深入群众，发现了该村贫雇裴九福等三人尚未翻身，便动员他们参加运动，当他们一接受了没有问题也能翻身的耕者有其田政策后，马上就联络了十一个贫苦的人，形成了运动中的骨干，并以他们为主，召开了全村的贫雇会议，宣传耕者有其田政策，启发大家诉苦，此时领导上又从这些贫雇中间，吸收了郭富、李纪有等参加了农会常委会，并向大众表扬他们与封建势力斗争的成绩，提高他们的威信。分配果实也以贫雇为骨干，公平合理的填补了窟窿。现全村十七个贫雇已充分发动起来，并有五人成为领导骨干。
