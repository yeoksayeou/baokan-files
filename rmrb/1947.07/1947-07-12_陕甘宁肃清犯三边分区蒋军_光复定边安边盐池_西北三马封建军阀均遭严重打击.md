    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 10th. The Northwest People's Liberation Army greeted "July 1st" and "July 7th" with glorious victories, recovering the three cities of Dingbian, Anbian, and Yanchi. The enemy who invaded the Sanbian District has been completely eliminated. Chiang Kai-shek's henchman, Ma Hong, spent three months painstakingly building fortifications stretching over 300 li from east to west, which were swept away. Thus, the Three Ma feudal warlords, who colluded with Chiang Kai-shek's and Hu Zongnan's troops to take advantage of the situation and invade our border region, have all received severe lessons from the People's Liberation Army. Ma Bufang's 82nd Division was first severely defeated in Longdong and retreated. Ma Hongbin's 81st Division was encircled and annihilated by us, with fewer than a thousand survivors. After the great victory in Longdong, our People's Liberation Army advanced towards Dingbian City on the 30th. The defending enemy, the 80th Division of Ma Hongkui's forces, was terrified and fled in panic. At the same time, Ma Dunhou (Ma Hongkui's eldest son)'s 10th Cavalry Brigade, 20th Regiment, entrenched in Anbian City, also fled. The local self-defense corps and returning home legions fled in panic to Yanchi. The two cities were subsequently recovered. At this time, Ma's 10th Cavalry Brigade, Provisional 9th Brigade, and 168th Brigade, which had invaded and occupied Yanchi, were panic-stricken and rushed to transport miscellaneous items out of the city overnight. The 20th Regiment of the 10th Brigade, which had fled to the city, was even more like frightened birds. For several days, the men did not dismount, and the horses were not unsaddled. On the eve of July 7th, as soon as the People's Liberation Army advanced to the outskirts of Yanchi City, the enemy fled in different directions. The People's Liberation Army immediately pursued them separately, and the enemy was utterly defeated. On the 7th, the People's Liberation Army marched into the city amidst the cheers of the people. According to preliminary statistics, more than 300 Chiang Kai-shek special agents and bandit leaders, including Zhang Lanting and Xu Shaolin, the county magistrate appointed by Chiang Kai-shek, were killed, wounded, or captured. More than 150 rifles and machine guns, 2,200 bags of flour, 1,600 dan of millet, and 300 loads of salt were seized.

    陕甘宁肃清犯三边分区蒋军
    光复定边安边盐池
    西北三马封建军阀均遭严重打击
    【新华社西北十日电】西北人民解放军以光辉胜利迎接“七一”与“七七”，收复定边、安边、盐池三城。侵占三边分区之敌已全部肃清，蒋介石爪牙马鸿三月以来日夜苦心赶筑东西长达三百余里之工事，被一扫而光。至此配合蒋胡军侵入我边区趁火打劫之三马封建军阀，已皆受解放军严重教训。马步芳之八十二师，首在陇东遭我痛击败退，马鸿宾之八十一师被我围歼残存不足千人。陇东大捷后，我解放军三十日向定边城挺进，守敌马鸿逵部整八十师闻风丧胆，仓惶溃逃，同时盘踞安边城的马敦厚（马鸿逵之长子）骑十旅二十团亦逃奔，该地自卫大队、还乡团等惊窜盐池。该两城随告收复。此时，侵踞盐池之马部骑十旅暂九旅及一六八旅等部惊慌万状，连夜赶运杂物出城，而逃至该城之十旅二十团更如惊弓之鸟，数日来马不下鞍人不解衣，七七前夕，解放军甫挺进至盐池城郊，敌即分路逃窜，解放军当分头追击，敌溃不成军。七日解放军乃于万民欢笑中进驻城内。据初步统计，共毙伤俘蒋特匪首张兰亭、蒋记边县长徐绍林以下三百余人，缴获步机枪一百五十余支，面二千二百袋，小米一千六百石，盐三百驮。
