    [This dispatch from Taiyue, July 7th] General Chen Geng of the Taiyue People's Liberation Army recently spoke to reporters about the changes in the situation of the patriotic self-defense war in the Southern Shanxi front over the past year, stating: The year of the patriotic self-defense war in Southern Shanxi has been a year of Chiang's defeat and our victory, a year of rapid changes in the Southern Shanxi situation. On January 13th last year, our army, in compliance with the ceasefire order, withdrew from the city of Quwo. Although the die-hard bandits Hu and Yan negotiated with us under the pressure of the people, they negotiated in name but attacked in reality, launching a pincer attack on our liberated areas from the north and south every day. From mid-May, they even assembled four divisions with more than 20,000 troops to fiercely attack our Fen River Delta area. Wherever they went, they arbitrarily slaughtered, looted, raped, and plunged the broad masses of people into a sea of blood. This was a development of the Japanese imperialists' "Three Alls Policy". After our repeated persuasion and warnings proved ineffective, we could no longer tolerate it and resolutely fought back, recovering Wenxi and Tao counties in one fell swoop. However, the Chiang and Yan die-hards still did not repent and continued their offensive. The patriotic self-defense war of the army and people of Southern Shanxi thus unfolded.
    Hu Zongnan, relying on the weapon support of his American daddy, vainly attempted to seize Shanxi province as the "King of Shanxi". He originally planned to send troops in early July, break through the southern section of the Tongpu Railway in three weeks, establish himself in Taiyuan, and jointly attack Shangdang. When he mobilized seven divisions to invade, he charged wildly, extremely arrogant. When Wenxi fell on July 11th, he had already occupied the entire line of the Yuncheng-Maojindu highway and hundreds of villages, but on the 13th, he fell into the net laid by our liberated area army and people. In the battle of Yanzhang, Hu's main force, the 31st Division, was wiped out in one fell swoop, with its commander, Liu Mingzhao, barely escaping with his life. The fleeing Hu die-hards were pursued and annihilated. Suffering this heavy blow, Hu's offensive was forced to stop temporarily. At this time, we pointed our spears north, liberated Hongdong, Zhao cities and other five cities, and controlled 270 miles of the central section of the Tongpu Railway, thwarting Hu and Yan's plan to attack us from the north and south.
    After this campaign, Hu was forced to postpone his plan to break through the Tongpu Railway to October 10th, and in early September, he pieced together eleven brigades to continue his northward invasion. Although the momentum was fierce at this time, the movement was greatly slowed, and it took more than 20 days to travel 290 miles. Unexpectedly, just after arriving in Linfen and before they could gain a firm foothold, the most elite First Brigade of the "Invincible Army" was completely annihilated by us in the area of Guanque (the junction of Fushan and Linfen) on September 23rd, and Lieutenant General Brigade Commander Huang Zhengcheng was captured. From then on, the morale of Hu's army was greatly diminished, and the offensive was once again forced to stop. Hu Zongnan lamented the destruction of his old capital and was furious. He went to Linfen to conduct a review. When he continued his northward invasion later, the eleven brigades advanced "side by side", which was even slower. It took four days to travel only 30 miles from Ganting to Hongdong, averaging only seven and a half miles per day.
    In winter, in order to save his military crisis, Chiang Kai-shek ordered Hu Zongnan to launch a risky attack on Yan'an. While he was drawing his main force to cross the Yellow River westward, our army advanced westward into the Lüliang Mountains, coordinating with our army in the Jin-Sui area to liberate seven cities, open up vast areas, and relieve the military threat to the eastern border of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. At this time, Dong Zhao led six brigades in a hasty counterattack, and his 67th Brigade was annihilated by us at Puxian at the end of December. At the same time, another unit of our army successively captured Jiyuan, Yuanqu, Yicheng, Lingshi and other cities, advanced along the Tongpu Railway, causing the enemy to be caught between a rock and a hard place, and attacked from both ends. From then on, the enemy in southern Shanxi shifted from offense to defense, forming a passive and beaten situation.
    This spring, the Battle of Yan'an began, and the Chiang-Hu die-hard bandits robbed Peter to pay Paul, transferring a total of seven brigades, including the First Division, to Shaanxi. In early April, we launched a counter-offensive with overwhelming superiority, pouncing on Houma, bisecting the Tongpu Railway. Then, with a sweeping momentum, we swept across both sides of the Fen River, striking south at the natural barrier between Qin and Jin at the Yumen Ferry and the natural barrier between Qin, Jin, and Henan at the Fengling Ferry. We then recaptured the important town of Quwo, liberated 25 county towns, and annihilated more than 20,000 enemies. The remnants were compressed into a few isolated strongholds such as Linfen and Yuncheng. Not only was the Chiang-Hu-Yan joint defense system shattered, but the flanks of Shaanxi and western Henan behind Hu's bandits were exposed to the powerful force of our army, providing strong support to the Northwest battlefield.
    Overall, in the heroic patriotic self-defense war of the past year, our army won six battles and six victories, successively liberating 34 county towns, annihilating more than 50,000 enemies, and causing tremendous changes in the situation in southern Shanxi and the entire Shanxi. Hu Zongnan's painstaking efforts over the past year have been completely destroyed. Our army has not only recovered all lost territory but has also opened up vast areas. In these areas, farmers are rebuilding their homes on the ruins destroyed by the Chiang-Hu army and are making every effort to carry out land reform and implement "land to the tillers." Another significant change is that our army is becoming stronger and stronger in battle, while the enemy is deteriorating day by day. In the past, it usually took us two or three days to capture a county town, but now it only takes a few hours. This time, it took only three hours to liberate the large commercial center of Jiangzhou in southern Shanxi, only one and a half hours for Ji County and Jishan, and only 30 minutes for Wenxi City. On the other hand, the decline in enemy morale and the weakening of combat effectiveness are in stark contrast. The Chiang-Hu army not only lost the fierce momentum it had at the beginning, but even the situation of crawling seven and a half miles a day is gone. Now they are just shrinking in their tortoise shells and waiting to be beaten. If the First Brigade Commander Huang Zhengcheng pretended to be strong when he was captured, then the Deputy Brigade Commander of the 27th Brigade, Wang Chen, immediately admitted that they were "low in morale and had no intention of fighting." In just one year, Hu Zongnan's "plan" has been turned into a bubble forever, becoming a ruthless satire on him. Hu Zongnan's main mistake was that he neither knew the enemy nor knew himself. He underestimated the strength of the army and people in the liberated areas and overestimated himself. The war over the past year has fully proven the truth that we have repeatedly pointed out: although the new weapons that Chiang Kai-shek relies on the support of the American reactionaries can enable him to temporarily occupy some cities, these American-equipped weapons have become an important source of weapons for the people's army; and when the main force of the invaders is weakened to a certain extent, the lost territory will eventually return to our hands, and the war will continue to develop until the death of Chiang Kai-shek's fascist "small court."
    Our success in achieving such brilliant achievements is not accidental. First of all, the land reform in the liberated areas has provided a basic guarantee for victory. The peasants who have been completely liberated are rising up with unparalleled enthusiasm to defend their land and defend their free and happy lives, and a widespread guerrilla war has been launched, encouraging peasants to rush into the army one after another and promoting the active participation of all peasants in the war and supporting the war. The local party, government, and people's comrades have made outstanding contributions in leading this movement. Secondly, it should be attributed to the close unity between the army and the people, especially the close cooperation between the local troops and the militia, so that Hu's die-hards, once they entered the Southern Shanxi area, not only encountered the powerful resistance of our field army but were also surrounded by the guerrilla war of all the people, with their eyes and ears blocked, and their backs and bellies attacked, eventually suffering a devastating defeat. Third, the tenacious fighting of all commanders and fighters and the heroic sacrifices of the martyrs have greatly promoted heroism, followed the mass line, and through complaining, meritorious service, mutual assistance, and finding solutions, the combat effectiveness of the troops has been rapidly enhanced, the discipline of the masses has been greatly improved, and the confidence of the troops in victory has been doubled. The improvement of equipment and the replenishment of soldiers are due to Hu Zongnan fulfilling the duties of a transportation captain. And Chairman Mao's wise leadership and correct military policy are the bright lighthouse on this road to victory.
    Undoubtedly, we have made great contributions in the patriotic self-defense war of the past year. Now "the beast is wounded, but not yet dead." We must not be complacent, we must learn modestly, prevent arrogance, continue to promote the new heroism and the idea of serving the people, not give the enemy a chance to breathe, continue to fight tenaciously and bravely, annihilate more invaders, create more victories, overcome all difficulties, plunge into the tide of the great counter-offensive, and welcome and strive for the greatest victory in the patriotic self-defense war.

　　陈赓将军纵谈晋南战局改观
  　号召军民投入大反攻
    【本报太岳七日电】太岳人民解放军陈赓将军顷就晋南前线爱国自卫战争一年来形势的变化，对记者发表谈话称：晋南爱国自卫战争的一年，是蒋败我胜的一年，是晋南形势急骤变化的一年。去年一月十三日，我军遵守停战命令由曲沃城关撤出。胡阎顽匪虽在人民压力下与我谈判，但谈判其名，进攻其实，每日每时均在对我解放区进行南北夹击。五月中旬起，更集结四个师两万余众猛犯我汾南三角地带，所到之处，任意屠杀抢掠奸淫，置广大人民于血海，这是日寇“三光政策”的发展。我屡次劝说警告无效之后，忍无可忍，遂坚决回击，一举收复闻喜、绦县，而蒋阎顽匪仍不知悔，继续进攻，晋南军民的爱国自卫战争从此展开。
    胡宗南挟其美国爸爸的武器支援，妄想侵占晋省为“山西王”，原定七月初出师，三个星期打通同蒲南段，驻节太原，会攻上党。当其调动七师人马进犯时，横冲直撞，骄慢异常。七月十一日闻喜失陷时，已侵据运（城）茅（津渡）公路全线与数百村庄，但十三日即陷入我解放区军民布设的天罗地网中。堰掌一战，一举歼灭胡主力三十一师，师长刘铭钊仅以身免，徵服落荒而逃。胡顽遭此重创，攻势被逼暂时停止。此时我方挥戈北指，解放洪（洞）赵（城）等五城，控制同蒲中段二百七十里，粉碎胡阎对我南北夹击的计划。
    经此战役，胡顽不得不将其打通同蒲计划展至十月十日，于九月初拚凑十一个旅继续北犯。此时来势虽猛，行动却大为迟缓，二百九十里路整走廿多天。不意刚到临汾，立足未稳，九月廿三日其最精锐的“天下第一军”第一旅又在官雀（浮山、临汾交界处）一带遭我干脆消灭，中将旅长黄正成就擒。从此胡军士气大馁，攻势再次被迫停止。胡宗南痛惜其发家老本覆灭，大发雷霆，亲赴临汾，进行检讨，以后继续北犯时，十一个旅“齐头并进”，更为迟慢，甘亭到洪洞仅卅里，竟花了四天工夫，平均每天只走七里半。
    入冬，蒋介石为挽救其军事危机，令胡宗南冒险进攻延安，当其正在抽调主力西渡时，我军即西进吕梁，配合晋绥我军，解放了七城，开辟了广大地区，解除陕甘宁边区东境军事威胁。此时董钊率六个旅仓惶赶来应战，十二月尾又在蒲县被我歼灭其第六十七旅。同时，另部我军连克济源、垣曲、翼城、灵石等城，挺进同蒲沿线，使敌顾此失彼，首尾挨打。从此，敌在晋南转攻为守，形成被动挨打的态势。
    今春延安之战开始，蒋胡顽匪剜肉补疮，将第一师等共七个旅调陕，而我于四月初即以压倒优势发动反攻，猛扑侯马，腰斩同蒲，继以席卷之势，横扫汾河南北，南捣秦晋天险之禹门渡及秦晋豫天险之风陵渡，继又克复重镇曲沃，解放二十五座县城，歼敌二万余，残敌被压缩到临汾、运城等少数孤立据点内。不仅蒋胡阎联防体系打得落花流水，且使胡匪侧后之陕南、豫西暴露于我军强大威力之下，给予西北战场以有力配合。
    总观一年来英勇的爱国自卫战争中，我军六战六捷，先后解放县城三十四座，歼敌五万余人，使晋南和整个山西局势起了巨大变化。胡宗南一年来的苦心经营，全部完蛋。我军不仅恢复全部失地，并开辟了广大地区，在此地区中，农民们正在蒋胡军毁坏的废墟上重建家园，并以全力进行土地改革，实行耕者有其田。另一显著变化，是我军愈战愈强，与敌人的每况愈下。过去我们攻占一座县城，通常得二、三天，如今只须几个钟头。这次解放晋南大商业中心绛州城共打三小时，佶县、稷山均仅费一时半，而闻喜城只费三十分钟。反观敌方士气的败坏，战斗力的衰弱，恰成明显的对比。蒋胡军不但初犯时的气势凶凶早已不见，就连每天爬行七里半的那种情况也没有了，现今只是缩在乌龟壳里专等挨打。如果说第一旅旅长黄正成被俘时还曾装腔作势，而二十七旅副旅长王忱被俘，则就立即承认他们是“士气低落，无心战争”了。时间不过一年，胡宗南的“计划”已永远变成泡影，成了对他一种无情的讽刺。胡宗南的主要错误就是他既不知彼又不自量，他过低估计了解放区军民力量，而过高估计了自己。一年来的战争已经充分证明，我们所屡次指出的真理，蒋介石依靠美国反动派援助的新式武器虽能使他暂时占领若干城市，但这些美械装备却成了人民军队补充武器的一个重要来源；而在进犯者主力削弱至一定程度时，失地终必重归我手，并且战争要继续发展下去，直到蒋介石法西斯“小朝廷”的死亡。
    我们所以获得如此光辉的成就并非偶然的，首先是解放区的土地改革给胜利作了基本保证。获得彻底解放的农民以无比的热情起来保卫土地、保卫自由美满的生活，普遍掀起了游击战争的烽火，鼓舞了农民争前恐后的涌入军队，并促成了全体农民的积极参战，支援战争。而地方党政民同志在领导这一运动上，更是功勋卓著的。其次，应当归功于全体军民亲密无间的团结，特别是地方部队与民兵的密切配合，使胡顽一进晋南地区，所遭到的不只是我野战兵团的有力阻击，而且是全体人民游击战争的包围中，耳目不灵，腹背受敌，终至碰得焦头烂额。第三是全体指战员的顽强战斗，烈士们的英勇牺牲，大大的发扬了英雄主义，走了群众路线，经过诉苦、立功、互助、想办法，使部队战斗力迅速增强，群众纪律飞跃进步，并使部队胜利信心倍增。装备的改善，兵员的补充，则又是胡宗南尽了运输队长的职务。而毛主席的英明领导与正确的军事方针，乃是这一胜利道路上的光辉灯塔。
    无疑问的，在一年来爱国自卫战争中，我们作了伟大的贡献。现在“野兽受伤了，但还没有死”，我们不能自满，要虚心学习，防止骄傲，继续发扬新英雄主义和为人民立功的思想，不给敌人以喘息的工夫，顽强勇猛的继续战斗，歼灭更多的进犯者，创造更多的胜利，克服一切困难，投入大反攻的浪潮，迎接和争取爱国自卫战争的最多胜利。
