　　Comparing Lifestyles During Production and Famine Relief
  　Landlords Live Well, But Their Attitude is Bad
  　Eliminate Barren Land During the Day, Eliminate Feudalism at Night
  　Licheng Carries Out "Double Elimination"
    [Report from this newspaper, Licheng] During the spring drought resistance and sowing, farmers compared their lives with those of landlords, and found that the lives of many farmers were still lower than those of landlords. When setting production plans, Zhou Ping, a liberated farmer from Henan, said, "What's the point of setting that? You can't build a wall without soil," complaining that he had too little land. Xu Wude from Renzhuang said, "A clever woman can't make porridge without rice. If I don't have land, how can I achieve 'cultivating three and having one surplus'? If I didn't know how to make vermicelli, I wouldn't even have enough to eat." Shen Qin said, "We are liberated, but we drink vegetable soup at noon, while the Shen Ji (landlord) family eats egg noodles." Old Zhang, a demobilized veteran, said, "We are meritorious in the revolution, but we only have a straw mat and a ragged sheepskin to sleep on at night, while they (landlords) not only have black felt, but also velvet blankets and red bedding." Yuan Xian said, "We are liberated and got a donkey leg, but the Tiger (landlord) is a feudal landlord and feeds a big mule; our cooperative has two thousand yuan, but their cooperative has ten to twenty thousand yuan; our eyebrows are thinner than their backbones, and we are far behind them." Changning's liberated farmers only had one mu of wheat, while the feudal landlord Jiu Sheng's family still abandoned thirteen mu of good wheat land. Zhang Lianqin from Beiliu said, "Compared with Duan Fude (a class one landlord), he is ten times stronger than us. Our three-person family lives in one cave dwelling, got a donkey leg, and cultivates ten mu of land that even wolves won't eat (the worst land), while he feeds a big black donkey and has thirty mu of good land, seven rooms, and four cave dwellings. This summer, he harvested more than five shi of wheat. We farmers save by mixing bran and vegetables, while the landlords mix eggs and pork." Because the feudal vestiges in the economy have not been completely eliminated, landlords constantly try to provoke and satirize the masses in politics. When the landlord Duan Fude from Beiliu saw our farmers, he said, "You are happy to share the fruits, eating noodles every day! But I am unhappy."
    He also said, "This is what society is like today, just live one day at a time," using this to undermine drought resistance and famine relief. A farmer from Zheng Society went to the landlord to ask for a dustpan, and the landlord said, "You are liberated, and you don't even have this?" Some farmers live in the same courtyard with the landlord's family, and the landlord often scolds the farmers' children: "You must be so happy to live in my courtyard." The Wang Family Village abandoned good land to the landlord, and he satirized the farmers, saying, "I didn't want to plant that wolf-unpalatable land long ago, you can suffer for a few days." When the farmer Shen Ji from Renzhuang spoke to the landlord a few times, the landlord didn't say a word.
    Through lifestyle comparisons, the farmers recognized the cunning of the landlords and that the vestiges of feudalism had not been eliminated. Everyone demanded the elimination of feudalism in production. In Xihuangxu, production was combined with cutting off the tail of feudalism, and the slogan was "Double Elimination": eliminate barren land (unplanted land) during the day, and eliminate feudalism at night. The Second District, after discussions in the mutual aid teams, used the method of "suddenly striking at the heart" to eliminate feudal vestiges. After deliberation by the poor and hired peasants in Beiliu, the farmers called all the feudal landlords in the village to a meeting and compared their lives face-to-face. This sudden attack prevented them from hiding anything. The landlord's unfinished meat noodles and meat dumplings were displayed at the meeting, and the facts of satire and provocation were brought out, exposing the landlord's conspiracy and tricks, and launching a movement to cut off the tail of feudalism. Beiliu Village cut out 19 mu of land, exchanged bad land for 119 mu of the landlord's good land, 148 shi of fine grain, 180 jin of cotton, and clothing, bedding, and cloth. Statistics from 21 villages in the Third District show that a total of more than 1,300 mu of land, more than 590 shi of grain, more than 900 rooms, 100 cave dwellings, 19 mules, 151 donkeys, and a lot of silver dollars, clothing, and utensils were seized. In Shanye and Hou Diyu villages, more clothing, agricultural tools, and utensils were seized than in last winter's movement. Statistics from 94 villages in the county show that, combining sowing with cutting off the tail of feudalism, a total of more than 3,700 mu of land, more than 160 multi-story buildings, more than 260 cave dwellings, 54 mules and horses, 265 donkeys, 41 cattle, more than 1,500 shi of grain, more than 5,000 silver dollars, and more than 1 million Jicha banknote were seized. Clothing was not counted. The fruits of this division were used by the farmers to compare their lives after liberation, and the fruits were distributed to the poor and hired peasants who had not truly been liberated last winter.

　　生产备荒中比生活
  　地主生活好态度坏
  　白天消灭白地黑夜消灭封建
  　黎城进行“双灭”
    【本报黎城讯】在今春抗旱下种中，农民与地主比生活，发现农民的生活有好多仍低于地主。订生产计划时，河南翻身农民周平说：“订那做甚，没土打不成墙，”嫌自己地少。仁庄徐五德说：“巧媳妇做不出没米粥，自己没有地，怎能达到耕三余一，不是我会下粉条，连吃也吃不开啦”。申芹说：“咱是翻了身啦，晌午喝是菜汤，申纪（地主）人家吃鸡蛋面。”荣退军人老张说：“咱是革命有功人，黑夜光席铺一张破羊皮，人家（地主）铺黑毡还不行，再铺上绒毡、红褥。”原贤说：“咱翻了身啦分了一条驴腿，老虎（地主）是个封建地主，喂是大骡；咱合作社入二千元，人家合作社入十来万元；咱眉毛比那脊梁骨，和人家可差远哩。”长宁翻身农民只有一亩麦，封建地主九生家，还丢下好麦地十三亩。北流张连芹说：“我和段福德（一类地主）比，人家比咱强十来倍，咱三口人住一孔窑，分了一条驴腿，种十来亩狼不吃地（最坏地），人家喂是大黑驴，还有好地三十亩、房有七间、窑四孔，今年夏天人家还打麦五石多。节约咱农民是掺糠、菜，地主那一伙是掺鸡蛋、猪肉。”因在经济上的封建尾巴没有彻底消灭，地主在政治上时时钻空挑拨，讽刺群众。北流地主段福德见了咱农民即说：“你们分上果实高兴啦，天天吃面吧！咱可低兴啦。”
    又说：“今天的社会就是这吧，活了一天算一天吧”，以此来破坏抗旱备荒。正社一个农民去地主去要簸箕，地主说：“你们翻身啦，连个这也没？”有些农民和地主家在一个院住，地主经常骂农民的孩们：“你们住上我这院可高兴死你。”王家庄给地主丢了好地，他还讽刺农民说：“那狼不吃地我早就不想种，你们也受几天吧。”仁庄农民申纪给地主说几声话，人家一声也不吭。
    在生活对比中，农民认识了地主的狡猾，封建还有尾巴没有消灭，大家要求在生产中要消灭封建。西黄须在生产中结合割尾巴，提出口号是“双灭”，白天消灭白地（未下种地），黑夜消灭封建。二区是在互助组中讨论成熟后，用了猛虎掏心的办法，突然消灭封建尾巴。北流贫雇农酝酿成熟后，农民把全村封建地主叫到会上，当面和他比生活。这样突然袭击，使他在不防中藏不了东西。地主没有吃完的肉面、肉饺摆在会上，把讽刺挑拨的事实都搬出来，揭穿地主这套阴谋鬼计，展开割尾巴运动。北流村割出土地十九亩，坏地换地主好地一百一十九亩，细粮食一百四十八石，棉花一百八十斤及衣服、被褥、布匹等。三区二十一个村统计，共割出土地一千三百余亩，粮五百九十余石，房九百余间，窑一百孔，骡十九头，驴一百五十一头及银洋、衣服、用具很多。善业、后狄峪两村割出衣物农具用具等，比去年冬运动还要多。全县九十四个村统计，下种结合割尾巴共土地三千七百余亩，楼房一百六十余间，窑二百六十余间，骡马五十四头，驴二百六十五头，牛四十一头，粮食一千五百余石，银洋五千余元，冀洋一百余万元，衣服没有统计。这次划出的果实，由农民比翻身生活，将果实分配给去冬真正没有翻透身的贫雇农民。（王维屏）
