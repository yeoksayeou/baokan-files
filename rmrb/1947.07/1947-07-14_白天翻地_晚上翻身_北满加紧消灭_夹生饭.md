Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, July 11th: Northern Manchuria is combining production with the thorough implementation of the land reform movement. Acheng County in Songjiang Province has adopted a method of combining production teams with struggle teams, "turning the soil by day, turning over a new life by night." When production teams rest in the fields, they discuss methods for the evening's struggle sessions. Bayan County has adopted a method of rotating struggle and production. During the spring plowing and summer weeding period from March to May, the county eliminated "half-cooked rice" in 68 villages, accounting for 54 percent of the total of 127 villages, a five-fold increase compared to the 12 villages eliminated in the previous two months. At the same time, the scope and depth of the struggle surpassed the mass anti-traitor liquidation struggle last autumn. In the in-depth struggle, in light of the relatively easy fulfillment of farmers' land demands in Northeast China and the extreme lack of livestock and production tools, the slogans "chop down big trees" and "unearth treasures" have been put forward and have become new content for deepening the movement in the future.

    北满加紧消灭“夹生饭”
    【新华社东北十一日电】北满各地结合生产贯彻土地改革运动。松江省阿城县采取生产小组与斗争小组结合，“白天翻地，晚上翻身”，生产组在地里休息时，就商量晚上斗争的办法。巴彦县采取轮流斗争，轮流生产的办法。该县在三月至五月春耕夏耘期间，即消灭了六十八个村的“夹生饭”占总数一百二十七个村的百分之五十四，较前两个月消灭十二个村增快了五倍。同时斗争之广泛深刻，还超过去秋群众反奸清算斗争。各地在深入斗争中，鉴于东北满足农民土地要求比较容易，而牲口及生产工具极端缺乏的特点，因此提出“砍大树”、“起财宝”口号，成为了今后深入运动的新内容。
