Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th: Seventeen soldiers, including Ma Fucai, from the 4th Company, 1st Battalion, 149th Regiment, 50th Division, New 20th Army (formerly 52nd Army) of the Kuomintang army stationed at the Dazhuanlan Bridge stronghold, 25 li outside of Shenyang, unwilling to fight in the civil war, collectively carrying one American-style light machine gun, one submachine gun, and seventeen rifles, traveled by night and rested by day, passing through the enemy's multiple defense lines. They arrived safely at the Liaoji Military Region of the Democratic Allied Army a few days ago and were warmly welcomed by the local military and civilians. Ma and others are farmers from Jinchuan, Hailong and other places, who were forcibly conscripted into the Kuomintang army last autumn.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 23rd: According to Shenyang newspapers, when the Kuomintang Liaoning Provincial Assembly held a meeting in late June, it revealed the ugly state of the Kuomintang lackeys fleeing at the first sign of the Northeast People's Liberation Army's offensive. Chen Weibang, a "member of parliament" from Yingkou, said: "When the Northeast war is tense, the county magistrate should live and die with the city, but the county magistrate is corrupt in peacetime and runs away in wartime." At this point, Xu Zhen, chairman of the Kuomintang Liaoning Province, his face flushed, stood up to stop him, saying: "You can't speak like this, which county magistrate is corrupt, please point it out..." Chen continued: "As the saying goes: fleeing at the first sign of trouble, the county magistrate of Gaiping can be said to have fled without any sign of trouble. On June 4th, the county magistrate, for some unknown mental illness, suddenly withdrew from the county seat with his men. Although he later returned, the police bureau, security team, and the county magistrate's wife all ran to Yingkou, causing prices in Yingkou to soar. Later, on June 10th, when the Communists really came, the county magistrate still ran the fastest. The county magistrate's wife later told people that she lost 25 million circulation notes while fleeing. If he wasn't corrupt, where did all this money come from?"

　　沈阳蒋军士兵十七人
  　集体携械投诚
    【新华社东北二十四日电】驻沈阳市外二十五里大转澜桥据点之蒋军新二十军（原五十二军）五十师一四九团一营四连士兵马福才等十七人，不愿内战，集体携带美式轻机枪、冲锋式枪各一挺，步枪十七支，夜行昼伏，通过敌人重重防线。于日前安抵民主联军辽吉军区，深受当地军民之欢迎，马等系金川、海龙等地农民，去秋为蒋军强征入伍。
    【新华社东北二十三日电】据沈阳报载：辽宁省蒋记省参会于六月下旬开会时，透露了蒋家臣仆在东北人民解放军攻势之前望风而逃的丑态。营口籍“参议员”陈维邦说：“东北战时紧张之际，县长应与城共存亡，但县长平时贪污，战时逃跑。”语至此，蒋记辽省主席徐箴面红耳赤的起立制止说：“不能这样发言，究竟那个县长贪污，请指出………”陈某继续说：“常言说：望风而逃，盖平县长可以说是无风而逃。六月四日，该县长不知犯了什么精神病，突然带了人退出县城，后来虽然又回去了，但警察局、保安队及县长夫人都跑到了营口，使得营口物价为之大涨。后来六月十日共军真的来了，县长仍然跑得最快。县长夫人事后向人说，她在逃跑时丢了二千五百万流通券，不贪污，这许多钱那里来的？”
