　　Ye County Sixty-Five Village Masses
  　Jointly Publicly Try Traitor-Tyrants
    [Report from our newspaper in Ye County] On June 23rd and 25th, the masses of the Third District in Mencunpu and Hebei Village publicly tried the major traitor, evil bully landlord Meng Jiushao, and Liu Jinchen. Meng was the pseudo-district chief of Xindianji appointed by Wang Ziquan. He had worked for Wang for nine years, acting as a loyal lackey. He was responsible for the killing of over eleven of our workers, arbitrarily arresting and killing the masses, extorting grain and fines, and embezzling to enrich himself, becoming a landlord. Liu was the secretary of Wang Ziquan's Water Conservancy Bureau and had been Wang's housekeeper for four years. Abusing his master's power, he engaged in major embezzlement and extortion, rising to become the leading household in Hebei Village, owning 150 mu of land. After our army liberated Ye County, the democratic government detained Meng and Liu, and then handed them over to the masses for handling. On June 23rd and 25th, grievance-airing public trial meetings were held in Mencunpu and Hebei, attended by over 4,500 people from sixty-five villages. Before the grievance-airing, each village engaged in mobilization and the leadership expressed its firm support for the masses to be masters of their own affairs. Therefore, the masses aired their grievances with great enthusiasm. Active element Chen Jun angrily said to Liu Jinchen, "You changed the path of stealing land to my land, and because I didn't agree, you sent me to Wang Ziquan where I was detained for half a month, trying to take my life. After someone recommended me to get out, why did I have to apologize and kowtow to you?" Then Liu Jinchen's aunt, who is sixty-five years old this year, cried with her white hair, "Jinchen! Twenty-eight years ago, you and I sold land for 50,000 yuan, which could buy 20 mu of land at that time. You spent my money, and now the money and land are both gone. I have no choice. The old man works as a long-term laborer for others, and I cook for you, and I haven't gotten a penny of wages in three years..." The old lady held her torn clothes in one hand and wiped away tears with the other. She couldn't even speak clearly. The masses were so angry that they beat Liu Jinchen severely.
    Finally, the entire village of Hebei publicly accused Liu, Meng, and others of illegally seizing property, heavy rent exploitation, raping women, and murdering people. After the public accusation, the masses demanded a thorough general liquidation, demanding execution in addition to settling the exploitation accounts. The government satisfied the demands of the masses and enforced the law on the spot. After the meeting, activists from Yaotou, Nanwangzhuang, and Hebei connected and said, "In the future, we must help each other when we hold meetings. When we hold meetings, you must come and participate." After the public trial, the activists became more determined. Chen Jun and Liang Jinming immediately went back and asked her for guns, and got five small guns. The masses have great enthusiasm for struggle.

　　邺县六十五村群众
  　联合公审奸霸
    【本报邺县讯】六月廿三、五两日，三区群众在孟村铺、贺北村公审大汉奸恶霸地主孟九绍及刘金辰。孟系王自全委派之辛店集伪区长，前后曾给王办事九年，为王之忠实害狗。我工作人员遭其杀走者达十一人之多，任意捕杀群众，罚粮罚款，贪污发家，变为地主。刘系王自全之水利局书记，并给王管家四年，狗仗人势，大事贪污讹诈，一跃而为贺北村首户，土地达一百五十亩。我军解放邺县，民主政府即将孟、刘扣押，旋即将其交付群众处理。六月二十三、五两日，在孟村铺、贺北召开诉苦公审大会，到会六十五村群众四千五百余人。在诉苦前各村酝酿动员，领导上表示坚决给群众撑腰作主，所以群众诉苦时，非常热烈。积极分子陈君气愤的向刘金辰说：“把偷地的路改到我的地，我不愿意你就把我送到王自全那里扣了半个月，还要我的命，经别人保举我出来，为什么还得赔不是给你磕头？”接着刘金辰的姑姑，今年六十五岁，满头白发哭着说：“金辰！二十八年你和我卖地卖了五万块钱，当时能买二十亩地，你把我的钱花了，到现在钱、地两空，没办法，老汉给别人住长工，我给你做饭，三年没得过你一文工钱…………”老太太一手拿着破衣襟、一手擦着眼泪。话也说不清了，群众气愤不过，将刘金辰痛打一顿。
    最后贺北全村群众公诉刘、孟等非法霸产，重租剥削强奸民女谋害人命等罪状。公诉后，群众要求彻底总清算，除算剥削帐外，要求枪决，政府满足群众要求，当场执法。会后，窑头、南王庄、贺北积极分子接了接头说：“今后咱们开会可要互相帮助，我们开会要时，你们就来参加。”公审会后，积极分子更加坚定，陈君、梁金明马上回去就主和她要枪，搞出小枪五支。群众斗争劲头很大。
