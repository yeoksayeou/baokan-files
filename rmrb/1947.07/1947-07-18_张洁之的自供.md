    Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 11th: Meng Fang reports: The 112th Regiment of the 38th Division of the New First Army, the most elite of Chiang Kai-shek's and Du Yuming's forces, was completely annihilated in the forests of the Laoye Ridge in eastern Jilin on May 21st. The body of Zhang Jiezhi, the regiment commander, had long been sent back to Jilin by the Democratic Army, but his "pocket-sized freedom diary" is still in our hands. It records his life from January to May 19, revealing the truth about this "ace army" of Chiang Kai-shek.

    Chiang Kai-shek's "Number One Army in the World," the New First Army, has always been proud and conceited, but after being repeatedly attacked by the People's Army, this thinking slowly changed. Regarding this point, Zhang Jiezhi wrote on January 9: "Went to the front to connect, the officers and soldiers are scattered and disorderly, and their embarrassing state is rarely seen. Thinking tonight of the misfortune suffered by Wang's unit (referring to Wang Dong's 113th Regiment) of this division, it is due to weak strength. Hereafter, the responsibility lies with this unit." Then, in March, our Democratic Allied Army completely annihilated the 89th Regiment of the 30th Division of the New First Army in Chengzijie, giving him more lessons. On March 5th, he wrote: "According to the common people, this time the 'bandits' invaded from the south, they gathered a small number of troops in separate routes ten days ago, and launched a fierce attack on Zeng's regiment (referring to Zeng Xu's 89th Regiment) in Chengzijie when we were unprepared, resulting in its annihilation. Jiutai, Tumenling, and Hwanzi were destroyed. This kind of tactics is due to the excellence of intelligence work and blockade of news." On the evening of February 17th, he attended a public banquet, during which someone asked: "Why are the 'bandit' troops so rampant and able to concentrate for training, while our large army is scattered and exhausted? What is the reason?" He himself replied: "To put it simply, we 'revolutionaries' only enjoy happiness after success and do not think of improvement; while the 'bandits' are racking their brains to plan, and their propaganda is very popular with the people, and their tactics are improving every day. Our high officials are full and living a peaceful life, and one 'bandit army' soldier is worth one of ours. The reason lies in this point.'"

    Regarding the discipline of Chiang Kai-shek's army, he wrote: "Woke up on the morning of April 5th and inspected the First Company. The company commander was lying down and not getting up, and the soldiers were disrespectful. Out of hatred, I beat him with my fists." "On the evening of February 23rd, I inspected the garrison and saw officers and soldiers gambling. I hated it deeply and confiscated the gambling tools and money, and confined the officers and soldiers."

    But what about the "discipline" and life of this regiment commander, who was already in his forties?

    "On January 13th, Hu (referring to his mistress) came and asked for a certificate to be issued to her tenant (four words in the diary are blurred). This is not within the scope of military affairs, but it is not good to refuse, so I agreed." "On the afternoon of February 3rd, I sent the certificate entrusted by Hu to her home by a coachman and ordered him to pick her up for dinner at my residence. Hu was particularly generous today. I had a drunken meal with her. After Hu left, my wife was jealous..." "On the afternoon of February 27th, Huilan (another mistress) came to talk, and we had dinner together. I got drunk again and couldn't help but feel emotional. I held her hand and talked for a long time. My wife was very jealous and had a big fight with me after I woke up and sent her home." This regiment commander really couldn't do without women for a day. When he set off to fight the Democratic Allied Army on March 19th, he took the main force to Jiutai Township, and confessed in his diary: "I drank too much last night, and my sexual desire was aroused. I lodged in a female teacher's room in the hotel and had lewd thoughts..." "On April 7th, I had lunch with Huilan. This woman is gentle and affectionate, and she is still considering the issue of marrying me." "On April 20th, I went to see Chang Yingsun (referring to Sun Liren) at his summons and only returned at 11 o'clock. After dinner, Fangwu and I each looked for a prostitute to sleep with for a day." This regiment commander was ordered to depart from Jilin on May 10th, and the entire regiment set up camp in Laoye Ridge, busying himself with inspecting the positions for several days, "and ordered all levels to work hard to strengthen the fortifications." After the Democratic Allied Army cut off La Ji's retreat, he still believed that "the officers and soldiers of this unit all have a strong will to fight and are waiting in battle." But on the 18th, he "received orders to return to Jilin, and I really don't know how the superiors are guiding!" "It is not easy to move in such a mountainous area, and food cannot be carried. Even if there are people after arriving in Jilin, there will be no food or ammunition. What strength is there to fight?" However, on the 19th, "another telegram arrived, ordering us to temporarily hold the original position and wait for orders to attack. I instructed the troops to bury unnecessary supplies, but those who were mentally sensitive destroyed some of the food, ammunition, and equipment, which was really too rash." But this "calm" regiment commander, the day after writing this diary, was completely and thoroughly annihilated in the Laoye Ridge forest along with his troops who "all have a strong will to fight."

    张洁之的自供
    【新华社东北前线十一日电】孟方报导：蒋杜军最精锐的新一军三十八师一一二团已于五月二十一日全军覆没于吉东老爷岭大森林中。该团团长张洁之的尸身也早经民主军送回吉林，他的一本“袖珍自由日记”，却还留在我们手里。上面记载了他自今年一月至五日五月十九日的生活，它透露这个蒋家“王牌军”的真相。
    蒋家“天下第一军”新一军，历来是骄傲自负的，但是他们遭到了人民军队的屡次打击后，这种思想就慢慢转变了。关于这点，张洁之在一月九日写道：“赴前线连络，官兵散漫零乱不堪，其狼狈之状实所罕见。夜来思本师此次王部（按指一一三团王东部）所遭不幸，实因力量单薄，此后责任系于本部。”接着三月间我民主联军又在城子街完全歼灭了新一军三十师八十九团，对他的教训就更多些。三月五日他写道：“据老百姓言，此次‘匪’南犯，早十日前即以少数部队分路集结，乘我未备，即猛勇攻击城子街曾团（按指八十九团曾絮部）覆没，九台、土门岭、河湾子被破坏，此种战法实为情报工作及封锁消息高明所致。”他于二月十七日晚曾赴公宴，席间有人问：“为什么‘匪’军如此猖狂，且能集中整训，而我则大军散处疲于奔命，是何理由？”他自己答道：“说来简单，我则‘革命’成功只去享快乐，不思上进；而‘匪’却在挖空心思打算，其宣传亦极得民心，战法天天进步。我大官们吃饱了过太平日子，‘匪军’士兵一个抵一个，原因就在‘点。’”
    关于蒋军部队的纪律，他写道：“四月五日晨起，巡视第一连，连长卧而不起，士兵则毫无礼貌。痛恨之余，饱以老拳。”“二月二十三晚巡视驻地，见官兵聚赌，深为痛恨，将赌具赌款没收，官兵禁闭。”
    可是这位已经四十多岁的团长，他自己的“纪律”和生活又怎样呢？
    一月十三日胡（按为其情妇）来，嘱出具证明书，以使其佃户（日记内有四字字迹模糊，）这非军人范围内事，但不答应不好，还是答应好了。”“二月三日午后，将胡所托之证明，令车夫携往其家，并令接她来寓内晚餐。本日胡特别大方，同余用饭酣醉，胡去后，妻醋性勃发……。”“二月二十七日午后，慧兰（另一情妇）来谈，一同晚餐，又醉，不禁情生，握手谈心者良久。妻醋意大兴，醒来送她归家后，妻与余大闹一场。”这位团长真是一天不要女人也不行，三月十九日出发与民主联军作战时，他带主力宿九台乡，在日记上又自供：“夜来饮酒过多，性欲冲动，旅店内宿一女教员，致起淫心……”，“四月七日与慧兰同午餐，此女性柔多情，嫁余问题伊尚在考虑中。”“四月二十日赴长应孙（按指孙立人）召见，十一时始回，餐毕与彷吾各觅一日妓而寝。”这位团长于五月十日奉命自吉林开拔，全团到老爷岭设营，一连几天忙着巡视阵地，“并命各级努力加强工事。”当民主联军腰斩拉吉后，他还认为“本部官兵咸具战心，严阵以待”。可是到了十八日，他就“奉令回吉林，真不知上峰是如何指导！”“在这样山岳地带行动不易，粮亦无法携带，到吉后，纵有人亦无粮弹，尚有何力量战斗？”然而十九日“电令又到，暂守原阵地，待命出击。当指示各部队，将不需用物资埋存，而精神过敏者，却将粮弹装备毁弃一部，真是太不沉着。”但是，这位“沉着”的团长在他写这篇日记后，第二天，就随着他的“咸具战心”的部队，全部干脆彻底地被歼灭在老爷岭大森中了。
