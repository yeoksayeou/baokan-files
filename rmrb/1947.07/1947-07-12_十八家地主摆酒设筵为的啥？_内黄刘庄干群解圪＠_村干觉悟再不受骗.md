(Jilu Yu Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 10th) After the village cadres of Liuzhuang Village in Neihuang underwent mass education and self-reflection, offering up their ill-gotten gains, the relationship between cadres and the masses became even more united. Landlords in the village tried to buy off the village cadres, the chairman of the farmers' association, and the director of the women's association with dinners and meat. These cadres were temporarily confused and accepted the bribes. Some individual cadres also took more than their share of the spoils, leading to dissatisfaction and demoralization among the masses. After understanding the situation, the district cadres immediately united the masses to educate the village cadres. They first educated the village cadres to reflect on their mistakes. Through praise, encouragement, and patient persuasion, they discovered that the chairman of the farmers' association, the director of the women's association, and the militia squad leader had all colluded with the landlords, opened back doors, and done things for the landlords. They then voluntarily requested a mass meeting to admit their mistakes to the masses. After the cadres cleared their minds, they immediately convened a meeting of the poor peasants' association to announce the facts of the village cadres' self-reflection to the masses. Initially, the masses were very indignant. The district cadres immediately mobilized and enlightened them, asking them to consider why the landlords gave the cadres wine and money, and whether the cadres had made any contributions. After the masses deliberated, they elected ten peasants and four youth and women, a total of fourteen people, as representatives to lead the masses. After mutual understanding, the cadres and masses gathered to resolve their differences. Six hundred men and women attended the meeting, along with village cadres from fifteen villages throughout the district. The atmosphere was extremely serious and enthusiastic. First, militia squad leader Comrade Liu Ligui confessed to everyone: "The eighteen landlords hosted a feast, eating and drinking heavily for ten days. We cadres all drank the wine that the landlords gave us with both hands. A few days later, landlords Wang Junsheng and Liu Hongdu and others collectively sent storytellers and opera singers to congratulate the cadres, saying that they would not take a single penny and would be fully responsible. The landlords also asked to become friends with us and held ten banquets. Landlords Si Guozheng, Liu Hongdu, and Wang Junsheng successively sent me 25,000 yuan, saying, 'Tell us if you're having trouble affording cigarettes!' Landlords Si Guohua and Liu Wenqi's family made two sets of single-layer clothes and two pairs of shoes for me and two militiamen, and constantly sent us vegetables. I ate the landlords' food and became soft-spoken, spent the landlords' money and became soft-handed. I opened the back door to release the landlords from the detention room twice, and left cypress boards and two buildings for landlord Si Guozheng, agreeing not to criticize Liu Wenbi." The chairman of the farmers' association and the director of the women's association also confessed on the spot. The chairman of the farmers' association, Liu Jinshu, said: "I drank the landlord's wine and signed a double insurance agreement with the landlord, and affixed my seal and fingerprint as evidence." He presented it to the masses on the spot. After speaking, the three of them, along with the old village cadres and militiamen, swore: "From now on, we will resolutely not open the back door, make contributions to the masses, fight the landlords to the end, never be fooled again, and never suppress the masses again. If we fail to do so, may we be struck by lightning!" The village cadres also offered up their ill-gotten gains to supplement the poor households. After the differences between the cadres and the masses were resolved, the morale of the masses was extremely high.
