Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th - TASS, Nanjing, 4th, quoting the Hong Kong Chinese Business Daily, reports: The Hong Kong and Kowloon Democratic League and other democratic parties and groups have jointly telegraphed the U.S. government and Congress regarding U.S. loans to China, issuing a warning. The telegram stated: "The Chinese people's tolerance for the civil war, which has caused widespread famine, has reached its limit. Any action that encourages the Chinese civil war will arouse strong dissatisfaction among the Chinese people. The Chinese government, controlled by the Kuomintang dictatorial clique, is now in urgent need of your loans, and substantial loans at that. We hope that you will refuse to grant such loans, because under the current circumstances, any form of supply to China is a method of encouraging the Chinese civil war. The Chinese people will never recognize such debts; and the democratic coalition government that will inevitably be formed will not be responsible for this loan."

　　港九民主党派警告美国政府
  　反对美国对蒋贷款
    中国人民决不承认这些债务
    【新华社陕北五日电】据塔斯社南京四日电引香港华商报报导：港九民盟及其他各民主政党与团体，顷就美对华贷款一节，联名致电美国政府与国会提出警告，原电略称：“中国人民对于造成广大饥馑的内战的忍耐，已达于极限。任何鼓励中国内战的行动，都足以引起中国人民强烈的不满。国民党独裁巢团控制的中国政府现在急需你方的贷款，而且是大量的贷款；我们希望你们拒绝予以这样的贷款，因为在现在的情况下任何形式的对中国的供应，都是鼓励中国内战的方法。中国人民将决不承认这样的债务；而必定要组成的民主联合政府，将对此项贷款不负任何责任。”
