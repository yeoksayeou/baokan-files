　　Two Years of Theatre Movement Work in Southern Taihang
  　and Several Existing Problems
    Jiang Ping
    Since the Taihang First Cultural and Educational Congress, these past two years have been a period of the fastest changes and most complex tasks in the border region. The theatre movement work in Southern Taihang has developed along with the development of this situation. Centered around the demands of the environment and tasks, combined with the central work of each period, in the past two years, significant achievements and progress have been made in the number of theatre troupes, the creation and improvement of dramas, the transformation of old artists, and the training of new actors.

    Regarding county theatre troupes, such as the Changzhi Victory Theatre Troupe, which has a longer history, last year, to cooperate with the land reform movement, the county and district leaders organized performances of "The White Haired Girl" in a planned way, and created small-scale operas such as "A Load of Water," "A Towel," and "Passing the Mid-Autumn Festival," which played a significant role in guiding reality and promoting the central work. The Huguan People's Theatre Troupe, which was only established two years ago, laid a new path for its own development from the beginning. Almost all of their performances are new dramas, and they created "Zhou Li Gets Land," and in particular, their connection with rural theatre troupes is the closest, continuously cooperating with rural theatre troupes to improve the level of village theatre performances. They are also able to systematically collect stories of heroes and model figures in the villages and promptly compile them into quick talks and drum lyrics for performance, which are welcomed by the broad masses. The Pingshun Farmers' Theatre Troupe also has many good creations, such as "Good Spinning and Weaving" and "Steaming Dry Rations." The main creation in their work is the spirit of serving the people diligently; they go to areas where the masses live in hardship to perform, reducing the price of tickets as much as possible, even performing for free; during the busy farming season, they help the masses with production during the day and perform at night, so the masses unanimously reflect: "This is really our own farmers' theatre troupe!" Other theatre troupes such as the Lucheng Masses and the Licheng Dawn have also made many gains in reflecting reality, combining work, and creating new forms. Dramas praising and portraying heroes include "Shi Cun Jin" and "Wang Tong Hui" by the Dawn Theatre Troupe, and "Liang Ma Dou" and "Yi Yuan Sheng" by the Masses Theatre Troupe. In particular, the health drama "Three Great Villains" by the Dawn Theatre Troupe broke through the old forms and used new symbolic techniques to express new content, and its propaganda and educational effect was very significant.

    In the recent self-defense war, the Dawn, Victory, and Masses theatre troupes went to the front line to perform for the troops for two months, further demonstrating the special qualities of the people's drama workers. In the tense combat environment, they personally built stages. To meet the needs of the soldiers, they sometimes performed until dawn. When they arrived at the regiments, they immediately compiled the collected heroic stories and model battles into short and pithy quick talks or drum songs; whenever they had time, they organized comfort groups to visit the wounded, or organized propaganda groups to carry out oral propaganda and write slogans, and sometimes they also helped the local masses cut wheat and grind flour. The soldiers of the Taihang troops said: "After all, our 'family' (that's what the Taihang soldiers call them) are the most affectionate!" The masses in the newly liberated areas also reflected: "No matter what they do, the Eighth Route Army people are good to the people." At the same time, the theatre troupe comrades themselves also gained a lot and were tempered in this participation in the war to comfort the troops.

    In short, the theatre movement in Southern Taihang has made great progress and creation in the past two years, and has made brilliant achievements in the self-defense war. We must cherish this achievement and develop it to a higher level. But we must realize that there are still some problems in our current work, and in order to make our work better, these problems need to be solved and improved urgently. Now, I would like to raise a few questions for your reference:

    Let's strictly review our existing drama forms. Generally, it is still the old routine of old forms and new content. Although it is a new thing, we still use the original Licheng Lezi or Shangdang Palace Tune to perform; there are not many short, pithy, lively song and dance dramas and Yangko operas. This is certainly due to the limitations of various conditions in the local theatre troupes, and it is not easy to get rid of the old routine, but basically it is still because most people's thinking is not clear enough, they stay in the old routine, and they are afraid and do not have the firm determination to create boldly. Therefore, the old forms are completely preserved in terms of singing and instrumentation, and the old rules are rigidly adhered to; for example, tragedies mostly use the Luozi tune, and comedies mostly use the Palace Tune, and at most only a few sections of Xiangyuan Yangko or quick talk are inserted.

    We all know that the reason why small dramas such as "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland" and "Female状元" are welcomed by the broad audience is that they not only combine reality to express the characteristics of new characters in the new society—new labor life, family relationships, and new emotions—but also because they are fresh and lively in form, short and pithy, and can reflect the new life of the liberated area people with simple scenes and short stories. But the comrades in our theatre troupes have not learned this point, but have developed in the other direction, only liking things that are large and useless or even all-encompassing. In fact, these large dramas compiled and performed by our theatre troupes are mostly unpopular with the masses. When these dramas were performed at the Heroes' Meeting last year, the audience always said: "Why isn't this drama over yet?" But when the small plays started, the audience perked up and wanted to see "another one," such as the Victory Theatre Troupe's "A Towel," "Passing the Mid-Autumn Festival," and the Xiangyuan Rural Theatre Troupe's "A Family" and "Want to Rest," which were all welcomed by the audience. However, some comrades in our theatre troupes do not study hard, but prefer large dramas, thinking that small plays are just for amusement and have no meaning. This problem must be solved as soon as possible.

    First of all, the comrades of the theatre troupe must clearly realize in their minds that today the masses urgently need fresh and lively things that can express their joy of turning over and winning, and the upsurge of production, supporting the front, and supporting the army, and urgently hope to see their own comedies. And this task cannot be completely solved by the old forms, which is why short, pithy, fresh, and lively song and dance dramas and Yangko operas are welcomed and urgently needed by the broad masses today.

    But some people think that "anyway, old dramas will never be abolished, and with my skills, I can do it for a lifetime." Or, starting from one-sidedness, they think that "old dramas are still popular, and some cadres still like to watch them." Due to this wrong understanding, even to this year, some old theatre troupes have spent tens of thousands of yuan to purchase old drama costumes, and usually sing the old-fashioned pull, fight, and sing, and some have made slight changes, but basically have not been improved. For example, when singing Xiangyuan Yangko, the sentence "Old daddy, he told me in detail" is often sung as "Old daddy's daddy, he told me, tell me in detail." How cumbersome this is and must be corrected!

    Especially surprising and must be prohibited is that old dramas that serve the ruling class and promote feudal superstition, backwardness, and reaction are still being performed by some theatre troupes, and some of the masses and even our cadres are still interested in them. Today, looking back, I think there are no more than the following reasons:

    First, the traditional influence of old dramas is deeper in the minds of the general public. Its form and content are very familiar. Its characteristic is that it is lively and easily stimulates and excites people's emotions. The sound of gongs and drums can attract people. Therefore, some audiences still welcome it in order to watch the excitement, have fun, and watch the "skills."

    Second, our new dramas have not yet developed to the point of completely overwhelming the old dramas. In particular, the new dramas created by many of our theatre troupes are both bland in form and dull in content. When new dramas cannot meet the audience's requirements, they naturally want to use old dramas to adjust.

    Third, there are not many newly compiled historical dramas, and the audience wants to see the "old skills" of the "old skills" at a certain time, such as Miao Long's "Anti-Xuzhou" by the Dawn Theatre Troupe and Er Miao's "Yanmen Pass" by the Victory Theatre Troupe, so some people think that "old dramas are still satisfying." The theatre troupe actors also think: "Old dramas are still popular."

    But among the general public, the vast majority still like new dramas. They are willing to watch new dramas that express their own new life and new dramas that open their minds. They know that "old dramas are all speaking for the landlords." They have long been tired of watching them. Therefore, the masses today truly love new dramas, but due to the current specific conditions in rural areas and the different development situations in various places, old dramas have not been completely overwhelmed by new dramas, which requires our drama workers to make more efforts in this regard. As for how to critically absorb the good things in old dramas and how to transform old dramas, I will not talk about them here.

    In addition. There is also a serious problem in our theatre troupes of learning from "big" theatre troupes and learning from "foreign" things. We are not against learning from big theatre troupes, but the comrades in our theatre troupes are superficially and partially influenced by the big theatre troupes in style and form, and then imitate them, such as starting a long opening remark at the beginning of organizing an evening party, and then ending with: "The evening party ends here, please go back to rest," and also using some makeup, lighting, scenery, effects, and so-called "style" that are not suitable for the current rural theatre troupes; in music, they do not go to familiarize themselves with the performance of local folk instruments, do not improve the skills of erhu and sanxian, and seek to improve from their own existing level, but often put effort into the violin; in language, they do not humbly go to the masses to learn to use the living language of the masses to express the new emotions of the masses, and seek theatrical effects, but instead use "official jargon," which is neither the dialogue of old dramas, nor the dialects of the masses, nor the stage language of dramas, resulting in a hybrid of four unlike things. These are all the comrades of our theatre troupes who have been harmed by the idea of learning from "foreign" things. They have not thoroughly and clearly understood that their work object is rural areas, have not started from the requirements of the masses, and have separated from reality. This is a dishonest work attitude. In this way, they will lose their true color as a farmers' theatre troupe, reduce their belief among the farmers, and greatly hinder the development of the rural theatre movement. Although some corrections have been made to this abnormal phenomenon, it has not been completely overcome in essence. I hope that the comrades who lead the theatre movement and the theatre troupes in various places will pay attention to this problem and correct it in time.

    Based on the above, I would like to put forward a few opinions on rural drama work in the future:

    First, we must seriously kick out the old circles, break the old routine, and promote the spirit of bold creation, and transform the existing performance technology according to the characteristics and needs of the new dramas.

    Second, we must create a large number of short and pithy Yangko operas and song and dance dramas (of course, it is not to say that large-scale dramas are not needed), and carry out music learning activities. On the one hand, we hope that the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and music workers in various parts of the border area will strengthen guidance and help, but the main thing is to rely on the efforts of the theatre troupes themselves, starting from learning Chinese musical instruments, improving the way of playing them, and learning to read simple scores and practice singing (foreign musical instruments such as violins can be temporarily not learned), collecting folk tunes, songs, folk songs, etc., and gradually improve their musical level.

    Third, we must overcome the purely entertainment point of view and the "skill" point of view. In the use of theatre troupes and the combination of central tasks, we should organize and help them in a planned way, and provide various conveniences in collecting materials and creating scripts.

    Fourth, we must recognize that the future of new drama development is bright and endless, and it will gradually squeeze the old drama out of the rural cultural front. Of course, the old drama form will still not be abolished within a certain period of time, and historical dramas will still be performed, but the future historical dramas will not remain at the current stage, and the content and form will be improved, and the new drama is always the mainstream of the theatre movement, there is no need to doubt this.

    Fifth, the working comrades of our rural theatre troupes must more clearly establish the concept of serving the farmers, often humbly listen to and adopt the opinions of the masses, eliminate the atmosphere of learning from "foreign" and "big" things, closely combine with reality, cooperate with the central work, continuously improve in content, boldly create in form, do not be satisfied with the status quo, honestly promote the existing advantages, make the work better, and make the rural drama movement in the border area develop rapidly.

　　两年来的太南剧运工作
  　及目前存在着的几个问题
    蒋平
    自太行一届文教大会结束后，这两年来是边区形势变化最快任务最复杂的时期。太南的剧运工作便随着这种形势的发展而发展着。它围绕着环境和任务的要求，结合着各个时期的中心工作，两年来无论在剧团的数量上、戏剧的创造和提高上，旧艺人的改造新演员的培养上都有着显著的成就与进步。
    县剧团方面，如历史较久的长治胜利剧团，去年配合翻身运动时，县区领导上有计划的组织演出“白毛女”，并创作了“一担水”、“一条手巾”和“过中秋”等小型唱剧，在指导现实推动中心工作上都起了很大的作用。壶关人民剧团，才成立仅仅二年，一开始就为自己奠定一条新的发展道路，他们演的差不多都是新剧，创作了“周理有翻身”，尤其与农村剧团的连系最为密切，不断配合农村剧团的出演提高了村剧团的演剧水平。并能有计划的收集村中英雄、模范人物的故事，及时编成快板、鼓词表演出来，得到广大群众的欢迎。平顺农民剧团也有很多较好的创作，如“纺织好”，“蒸干粮”等，他们在工作上的主要的创作，是为人民服务的艰苦作风；他们到群众生活较苦的地方去演剧，尽量把戏价降低甚至一个钱不要，演员们自己背上行李去义务演出；农忙季节，他们白天帮群众生产，晚上演戏，所以群众一致反映：“这真是咱们农民自己的剧团。”其他如潞城大众，黎城黎明等剧团在反映现实结合工作和新形式的创造上也有不少收获。歌颂与表现英雄的剧有黎明剧团的“石寸金”、“王同会”，大众剧团的“梁马斗”、“义元胜”等，特别是黎明剧团的卫生剧“三大恶霸”，突破了旧有形式，用新的象征手法表现了新的内容，宣传教育作用很大。
    在最近的自卫战争中，黎明、胜利、大众三个剧团赴前线劳军演出两个月，更发挥了人民戏剧工作者的特别品质，他们在紧张的战斗环境里，亲自动手搭台子，为了满足战士们的要求，他们有时一直演到天亮。到团里去时，立刻将搜集到的英雄故事，模范战斗编成短小精悍的快板或大鼓唱出；一有时间便组织慰问小组去慰问伤员，或组织宣传组作口头宣传写标语，有时还帮助当地群众割麦、推碾，太行部队战士们说：“到底还是‘娘家人’（太行战士这样称呼他们）亲热”！新解放区群众也反映：“八路军里不管干什么的都对老百姓好”。同时，剧团同志本身在此次参战劳军中也有很大收获，得到锻炼。
    总之，二年来的太南剧运是有了很大的发展与创造，在自卫战争中有了辉煌的成就。我们必须宝贵这种成就，并加以更高的发扬。但必须要认识到，目前我们的工作中仍然存在着某些问题，为了使我们的工作作的更好，这些问题便亟须解决与改进。现在，提出几个问题以作大家参考：
    严格检讨一下我们现有的戏剧形式，一般的还是旧形式新内容的老一套。虽然是新的事物，我们却仍然用原封不动的黎城乐子或是上党宫调来演；短小精悍，新鲜活泼的歌舞剧、秧歌剧并不多。这固然由于地方剧团有各方面条件的限制，旧一套不易摆脱，但基本上还是由于一般人思想上不够明确，停留于老一套，不敢也没有坚定的决心来大胆创造。所以在唱调上、器乐上都还完整的保留着旧有形式，死守着旧有的规律；如悲剧多用落子腔，喜剧则多用宫调等，最多也不过插入几段襄垣秧歌或快板。
    我们都知道：“兄妹开荒”、“女状元”这类小剧之所以能受到广大观众的欢迎，是它不但在内容上能结合现实表现出新社会里新人物的特点——新的劳动生活家庭关系与新的情感，而且也由于它在形式上作到了新鲜活泼，短小精悍，能用简单的场面，短小的故事反映，解放区人民的新生活。但我们剧团里的同志没有学习到这一点，反而向另一方面发展，只喜欢大而无当甚至包罗万象的东西，实际上我们的剧团所编演的这些大剧，多不受群众欢迎。去年在群英会上演出这些剧时，观众们总是纷纷地说：“怎么这剧还不完呢”？但当小戏一开始，观众们便提起精神，看了一个还要“再来一个”，如胜利剧团的“一条手巾”、“过中秋”，襄垣农村剧团的“一家人”、“想歇歇”等小型秧歌剧，都是观众所欢迎的。可是我们有些剧团同志不好好学习，偏爱大剧，认为小戏只是逗笑，没啥意思。这个问题必须及早解决。
    首先，剧团同志在思想上一定要明确认识到：今天群众迫切需要能够表达出他们翻身胜利的愉快，和生产、支前、拥军等热潮的新鲜活泼的东西，迫切地希望看到自己的喜剧。而这个任务不是旧的形式能全部解决的，这便是为什么短小精悍新鲜活泼的歌舞剧和秧歌剧在今天为广大群众所喜闻乐见与迫切需要的原因。
    但是有的人却认为“反正旧剧是永不会取消的，凭我这套本事，一辈子就行了。”或者从片面出发认为“旧剧还是吃得开，有的干部还爱看哩”。由于这种错误的认识，所以到今年为止，还有些老剧团拿数十万元置买旧剧行头，平素唱的仍是旧形式的拉、打、唱，有的虽稍有改变，但基本上并未改进。譬如唱襄垣秧歌时，如“老爹爹他对我把话细讲”这一句，唱时常常唱为“老爹的爹，他对的我来，把话细呀讲”。这是如何累坠，而须要纠正啊！
    尤其令人惊讶与极须禁止的是那些为统治阶级服务宣传封建迷信落后反动的旧剧，仍然有剧团演出，而且仍然有部分群众甚至我们的干部对它感到兴趣，今天检讨起来，我想不外以下几个原因：
    一、旧剧的传统影响在一般人心中较深，它的形式与内容都很熟悉，它的特点是烘火热闹，容易刺激和兴奋人的情绪，锣鼓喧天能吸引人，因此部分观众为了看热闹，图高兴，看“把式”，就仍然欢迎它。
    二、今天我们的新剧还没有发展到完全压倒旧剧的地步。特别是我们的很多剧团所创造的新剧形式上既是平淡无奇，内容上又枯燥无味。在新剧不能满足观众要求时，他们便自然的想拿旧剧来调剂一下。
    三、新编的历史剧不多，观众到一定时候就想看“老把式”的拿手戏，如黎明剧团淼龙的“反徐州”，胜利剧团二苗的“雁门关”等就应时而演唱，所以有些人便认为“还是旧剧过瘾”。剧团演员也认为：“还是旧剧吃得开”。
    但是在一般群众中，喜欢新剧的仍然是绝大多数，他们愿意看那些表现他们自己的新生活及开脑筋的新剧，他们懂得“旧戏都是替地主说话的”，他们早就看厌了。所以，在今天群众真正爱看的还是新剧，但由有目前农村具体的条件不够及各地发展情形不同，旧剧还没被新剧完全压倒，这需要我们的戏剧工作者同志在这方面加倍努力。至于如何批判地吸收旧剧中好的东西及如何改造旧剧等问题这里不多谈。
    另外。我们的剧团中还存在着一个严重的学“大”剧团、学“洋”的问题。我们并不反对向大剧团学习，可是我们的剧团同志在作风上形式上受到大剧团的表皮的及片面的影响，便摩仿起来，如在组织晚会时，开头先来个很长的开场白，最后再来个：“晚会到这里为止，请大家回去休息”，还采用了一些并不适用于目前的农村剧团的化装、灯光、布景、效果与所谓“派头”等；在音乐上不去熟悉本地土乐器的演奏，不去提高二胡三弦的技术，求得从自己现有的水平上去提高，反而常常在小提琴上下工夫；在语言上不去虚心到群众中学习用群众活的语言来表达群众的新的情感，求得戏剧上的效果，有的反而打起“官腔”来，既不是旧剧的道白，更不是群众土语，又不是话剧的舞台语，结果弄得四不象。这些都是我们剧团同志的学“洋”的思想害了人，他们没有彻底明确地了解到自己的工作对象是农村，没有根据群众要求出发，脱离了实际。这是一种不老实的工作态度，这样一来，他们会失去自己是农民剧团的本色，降低自己在农民中的信仰，大大防碍了农村剧运的开展。这种不正常的现象，虽已有某些纠正，但基本上尚未有完全克服，希望各地领导剧运及剧团的同志注意这一问题，及时予以纠正。
    根据以上所谈，兹提出今后对农村戏剧工作的几点意见：
    第一，要认真踢开旧圈子，打破老一套，发扬大胆创造的精神，把旧有的演奏技术根据新剧的特点与需要加以改造。
    第二，大量创造短小精悍的秧歌剧，歌舞剧，（当然不是说大型剧就不需要），并开展音乐学习运动，一方面希望文联及边区各地音乐工作者加强指导与帮助，但主要的还是要依靠剧团自身的努力，从学习中国乐器，改进它的拉奏方法及学习识简谱练习唱歌等着手，（提琴等外国乐器可以暂时不学）搜集民间小调，曲子，民歌等，逐渐提高自己的音乐水平。
    第三，克服单纯娱乐观点和“把式”观点，在剧团的使用与中心任务的结合上，应有计划的组织与帮助他们，并给予在搜集材料创作剧本上的各种便利。
    第四，要认识到新剧发展的前途是光明的无止境的，它将要逐渐把旧剧从农村文化阵地上挤出去。当然，旧剧形式在一定时期内仍然不会取消，历史剧仍然要出演，但未来的历史剧不会仍然停留在目前这样的阶段上，内容形式都要改进，而新剧总是剧运的主流，这是用不着怀疑的。
    第五，我们农村剧团的工作同志要更加明确的树立为农民服务的观点，经常虚心倾听与采纳群众意见，肃清学“洋”学“大”的风气，紧密地结合现实，配合中心工作，内容上不断改进，形式上大胆创造，不要满足现状，老老实实发扬既有的优点，把工作搞得更好，使边区农村戏剧运动得到飞速进展。
