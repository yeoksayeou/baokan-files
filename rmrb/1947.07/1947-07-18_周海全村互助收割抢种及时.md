[This report from the Jin-Lu-Yu area was filed on the 14th] Zhou Haiquan Village, in the Third District of Nanfeng, has achieved remarkable results by implementing labor exchange and mutual aid. Since the establishment of mutual aid groups in the village, various tasks have been well integrated. The wheat harvest was completed and stored in just two and a half days. After a light rain on the evening of June 14th, the entire village, men and women, organized a rush to plant. Most of the crops have been sown, and Zhou Hai is now a green field. The Nanfeng County Committee issued a special commendation to the village, called on other villages to learn from it, and sent people to Zhou Hai for on-site visits. The county government also issued instructions, explaining that the village's good production was due to three reasons: (1) Women and children with partial labor power participated in production; (2) A work point system and labor dividends were implemented; (3) Village cadres were able to seize opportunities, such as the timely adjustment of farm tools and resolution of seed shortages during the recent light rain. In Zhou Haiquan Village, with 112 households, under the busy tasks of military service and war support, it was proposed that men, women, old, and young should all participate. Except for a few who fled, all villagers participated in labor exchange and mutual aid groups. The combination was entirely voluntary. Group members were organized on a household basis. For example, instructor Zhou Jincheng participated in the seventh group, and his wife and children also participated in the seventh group. Work points were assessed based on the amount of work done, and evaluated after each task was completed. Livestock capable of work were counted as one worker. One full work point was awarded for war support tasks such as providing large carts, stretchers, and digging rivers. Labor dividends were distributed by deducting 25% of the actual yield of the land and then distributing it according to the amount of work done.

    周海全村互助收割抢种及时
    【本报冀鲁豫十四日电】南峰三区周海村，实行变工互助，获得显著成绩。该村自成立互助组以来，各种工作结合很好，麦收二天半工夫，即全部收割回家，并打藏完毕。六月十四日晚落小雨后，全村男女组织抢种，农作物大都种上，目前周海已是绿田一片了。南峰县委会特通令表扬该村，并号召外村学习，派人往周海实地参观。县政府也发指示，说明该村生产好的原因有三：（一）妇女儿童半劳力参加生产，（二）实行了记工和劳力分红，（三）村干领导能抓紧时机，如这次下小雨时，村干及时调剂农具与解决种子困难。按周海全村一百一十二户，在参军与战勤繁忙的任务下，提出男女老幼一齐下手，全村除去少数逃亡户外，均参加了变工互助组，结合完全出于自愿，小组的成员都是以家庭为单位组成，如指导员周金成参加了七组，他的老婆孩子也参加了七组。评功记工，按干活多少来算工，每干完一个活评论一次。能干活之牲口顶一个人工，出大车担架挖河等战勤工作，出一天算一整工，劳力分红按地的实收量抽百分之二十五，再按工多少摊分。
