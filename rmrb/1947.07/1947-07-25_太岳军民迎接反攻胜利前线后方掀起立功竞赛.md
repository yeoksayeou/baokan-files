　　[This newspaper's Taiyue Dispatch, 19th] "Strive for victory in the counter-offensive!" has become the slogan of action for everyone, men, women, old, and young, here in the front and rear. First, the front-line troops, in addition to requesting the glorious task of the counter-offensive and formulating merit-earning plans, voluntarily submitted various guarantees to their superiors. A certain brigade proposed the "Four No Returns" campaign: (1) No return without eliminating Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorial rule. (2) No return without avenging ourselves. (3) No return without becoming a meritorious person in the counter-offensive. A certain unit annihilated a regular Chiang Kai-shek regiment in Pinglu on the ninth day of formulating its counter-offensive merit-earning plan. Liberated peasants in the rear are vying to hand over counter-offensive grain. From Lingshi and Jiexiu in the north to the Fen River Plain and the core areas of Yangcheng and Qinshui in the south, liberated peasants are shouting: "Hand over one more grain for the counter-offensive, eliminate one more enemy." Although special agents in the border areas of Jilu and other counties have tried every possible means to spread rumors, sabotage, and threaten, the masses are not moved and are still actively handing over public grain for the counter-offensive. When transporting the grain, families from the east provide carts, and families from the west provide livestock, automatically combining their efforts. In Shuicun, Yangcheng, in the core area, the entire village's public grain was handed over in just one morning. Women in Qinyuan, Yuebei, etc., completed 130,000 pairs of military shoes ahead of schedule to welcome the counter-offensive. In Zhatan, Weicun, Qinyuan, a thousand pairs of military shoes were completed in just three days, with good styles and durability. Young people are vying to go to the front line to earn merit. On the 12th of this month, more than a thousand soldiers requested to go to the front line. After the leaders repeatedly explained the importance of consolidating their achievements and striving for even greater achievements, three hundred fists were raised high on the spot, and they signed up to go to the front line to earn merit. Various rear organs, such as the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, banks, and newspapers, are all supporting the front-line counter-offensive by streamlining their own organizations and expanding their counter-offensive forces. The Yangcheng Post Office launched a "fast movement," aiming to double the existing speed and also put forward three guarantees: "Not a single item lost, not a single item wrong, not a single item delayed." Although the postal worker Sun Lianzhu is young and weak, he bravely volunteered to earn more merit and aims to carry 65 jin and travel 100 li a day. Li Yutang even proposed to carry 75 jin and also travel 100 li a day. The Taiyue Xinhua Daily called on correspondents to concentrate on reporting the great deeds of the masses in the counter-offensive. The Yangcheng ballad singing team organized a recitation flying squad, going wherever they are needed, singing wherever there are heroic deeds.

　　太岳军民迎接反攻胜利前线后方掀起立功竞赛
    【本报太岳十九日电】“争取反攻胜利而奋斗”成为此间前后方男女老幼每个人的行动口号。首先，前方部队除纷纷请求给予反攻的光荣任务，订立立功计划外，自动向上级提出各种保证。某旅提出四不回运动：（一）消灭蒋介石独裁统治不回。（二）不为自己复仇雪恨不回。（四）当不上反攻中的功臣不回。某部订立反攻立功计划的第九天，就在平陆消灭蒋记一个正规团。后方翻身农民争先恐后的交纳反攻粮，北起灵石、介休，南至汾河平原，以及腹心地区的阳城、沁水等地翻身农民喊出：“多交一颗反攻粮，多消灭一个敌人。”边沿区稷麓等县虽然有特务百般造谣破坏威胁，但群众不为所动，仍旧踊跃交纳反攻公粮。在运送时，东家出车，西家出牲口，自动结合。腹心地区之阳城水村仅一晌功夫，将全村公粮完全交清。岳北沁源等妇女为迎接反攻，提前完成十三万双军鞋。沁源卫村渣滩竟在三天之内完成千双军鞋，样式好，又耐穿。人年青纷纷争上前线立功，本月十二日，士兵千余人г?垂ゴ蠡嵘希??险揭壅蕉饭Τ悸肀ν?硎?要功上加功后，当场就有三百个拳头高高举起，报名上前线立功。各后方机关，如工商局、银行、报社均以紧缩自己机构，扩大反攻力量来支援前线反攻。阳城邮局发起“快速运动”，把现有速度还要增加一倍，更提出三条保证：“一件不丢，一件不差，一件不压。”邮工孙练柱虽然年小体弱，但奋勇自报，要多立功劳，今后要作到担挑六十五斤，日行百里。李玉堂更提出担七十五斤，也日行百里。太岳新华日报号召通讯员集中力量报导反攻中群众的伟大事迹。阳城鼓书队组织一种朗诵飞行小组，那里需要就到那里去，那里有英勇事迹就在那里歌唱。
