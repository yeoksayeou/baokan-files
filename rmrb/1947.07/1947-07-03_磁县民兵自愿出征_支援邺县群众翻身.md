Ci County Militia Volunteers to Join the Battle, Supporting Yexian Masses to Overthrow Oppression

[Our Newspaper, Ci County News] Militia members in our county are enthusiastically volunteering to support the masses in Yexian County. On June 6th, 400 militiamen set off for Yexian County to assist the people in the newly liberated areas with summer harvesting, grain storage, and the work of overturning oppression. After the companies arrived in the county, they were assigned to areas very close to the enemy (around Anyang City in the Second District). They quickly seized the initiative and launched fierce guerrilla warfare against the enemy, while also helping the local people with production and various aspects of life, completing the task of protecting the summer harvest and grain storage without being disturbed by the enemy in the slightest. Following this, they further actively attacked the enemy in Chenjiaying, Changbaying, and Goucun areas behind enemy lines. Starting from the 8th, there was not a single day without fighting the enemy, engaging in 14 battles in nine days. On the 9th, the enemy attempted to attack, but was met with a head-on counterattack by a platoon of our first company, killing one enemy soldier. Comrade Liu Ruilian used a machine gun to wound two enemy soldiers, and the enemy fled in disarray. Subsequently, the enemy launched continuous attacks on the 12th, 15th, and 16th, but comrades Qi Handong and Wang Yaoxing of our second and third companies used sniper fire to kill or wound three enemy soldiers. In total, six enemy soldiers were killed or wounded in nine days, while we suffered no casualties. During each battle, the morale of the militiamen was extremely high, and no one was lazy. They all competed to perform meritorious service for the people and had great confidence. During breaks from fighting, they seized the time to help the masses with production. On the 10th, they helped the families of soldiers and martyrs weed cotton fields totaling 20 mu, harvested 12 shi of wheat, irrigated 1.5 mu of land, and plowed 5.5 mu of land. They completed the two major tasks of combat and production, and in the process of production, they also inspired workers to settle accounts with their employers. (Yu Bin, Bao Xin)

[Our Newspaper, Anyang News] Landmine warfare is being widely carried out in Anyang, actively blockading the enemy within their strongholds. On the evening of the 18th, militiamen from our Second District, in coordination with the cadres from the Fourth District and the ×× Regiment, a total of more than 30 people, laid eight landmines in Mazhuang, killing one enemy soldier and wounding two others. One of them was seriously wounded and had a leg blown off.

On the 20th, Wang Heijin, the militia company commander from our First District, took the initiative to attack the enemy north of Meiyuanzhuang, killing two enemy soldiers.

On the 21st, a company of Chiang Kai-shek's troops went to Xiaomao Wenjian in our area to rob 300 jin of grain. Our militiamen immediately coordinated with a portion of the Ninth District's cadre team to pursue them. Comrades Liu Duo and Jia Rui of the district cadre team each killed one enemy soldier, Comrade Jia An wounded one, and the militiamen killed two enemy soldiers.

On the 22nd, a unit of Chiang Kai-shek's troops went to Sifengzhuang and other villages in Sigou to rob grain, and also went to Balizhuang to demand cakes and rob the people's chickens. The Xizhi militia company and the Ba Niu Linsheng militia company of our Seventh District coordinated to pursue the enemy. Under the pressure of sniper fire, the enemy stepped on the landmines we had buried in the west of Balizhuang, killing three and wounding two (seriously wounded). Kang Xizhi's sniper team wounded two enemy soldiers. Another group of enemies near the blockhouse east of Zhidong also stepped on the landmines we had buried, killing one and seriously wounding four. We suffered no casualties. (Military Affairs Committee Communications Team)
