　　Nurseries in the Merit Campaign
    On June 1st Children's Day, we received suggestions from parents hoping to strengthen the children's affection for the nursery so that the children would not cry when returning to the nursery. They hoped the caregivers would care for the children with the same concern as if they were their own, so that the children would be lively and healthy. In order to realize these parental suggestions and respond to the call from leading comrades regarding the merit campaign, we resolved to carry out a merit campaign. In this merit campaign, the nursery work has been greatly improved. First, the caregivers' methods of managing the children were transformed, and a sundry affairs team was established to specialize in all the sundry tasks of the class. Caregivers can now focus on taking care of the children. Two people are paired into a group, divided into morning and afternoon shifts. The caregivers' energy is concentrated, and they have time to participate in the children's play, such as drop-the-handkerchief and singing. The children's crying has decreased, and the caregivers' interest has increased. Whether on the playground or in the yard, adults and children play together and sing together, appearing lively and orderly. In the past, the dining hall was noisy during mealtimes. Now, each table has a caregiver specifically paying attention to serving food, and the adults do not talk either. Therefore, the dining hall is very quiet, and the children have developed the good habit of not talking while eating. Second, we transformed the teaching methods, selecting interesting content and learning methods suitable for children. In the past, the teacher did most of the talking. Now, the children are also organized into groups, based on the children each caregiver is responsible for. A group leader is selected, with children managing children, and children comforting children, which has played a significant role. For example, the group leader distributes items. The bigger ones are given to others, and the smaller ones are kept for themselves. If someone cries, the group leader goes to comfort them, promoting a spirit of friendship and mutual assistance. Every day before bedtime, you can see each caregiver talking to the children they are responsible for, under the trees, on small stools, on mats, on doorsteps, in the arms of the caregivers, warmly and affectionately recounting the events of the day, and reviewing the day's good points and shortcomings. This is also a new system, but it has played a big role. For example, some children used to not want to get out of bed. Now we tell them the night before to have a getting-up-early competition tomorrow. Whoever gets up without crying wins, and sure enough, the children don't cry the next day.
    This is a clear demonstration of the improvements in our work during the merit campaign. Comrades are all competing to earn merit, especially Comrade Zhang Ji'hui, the head of our feeding team, who is a model of merit and has made great contributions to the children. He loves the livestock, and the livestock are all fed until they are shiny and fat. At the same time, his spirit of thrift is particularly good. The livestock are fed so well, but in six months, he has saved 2,300 jin of feed. The feed for three livestock is enough for four. He doesn't waste a bit of fodder, and he saves five qian of lamp oil every day, not lighting a lamp when feeding the livestock at night. He also saved a dairy cow, which is related to the daily milk supply for all the children in the nursery. That cow had sores on its head with maggots. He promptly thought of a way to wash and medicate it, and in a few days, it was completely healed. Otherwise, if the maggots had entered the brain, the cow would have been finished.
    Another example is Comrade Fang Jinmei, a caregiver in the senior class. Her patience, kindness, and care for the children are as warm as if they were her own children, younger brothers, and younger sisters. She has influenced the caregivers in her class to treat the children the same way. Each class and group has made contributions, and everyone is now striving for the next merit flag.

### 立功运动中的托儿所

　　立功运动中的托儿所
    四四儿童节我们收到家长的意见，希望加强儿童对托儿所的感情，孩子回托儿所不哭，保育员带小孩象自己的娃娃一样的关心，使孩子活泼健康。为了实现家长们这些意见并响应领导同志关于立功运动的号召，所以我们下决心开展立功运动，在立功运动中保育院工作得到不少改进。首先改造了保育员经营孩子的方法，成立杂务班，专门作班上的一切杂务工作，保育员可专心照看孩子，二人编一组，分上午下午两班，保育员精力集中，有时间参加孩子玩耍，如丢手绢、唱歌等，孩子的哭闹减少了，保育员的兴趣增加了，无论在操场、院内大人和孩子一起玩，一齐唱，显得活跃有秩序。过去孩子吃饭时声音乱，现在每个桌上都有一个保育员专门注意盛饭，大人亦不说话，因此饭堂很安静，孩子们养成了食不语的好习惯。其次我们改造了教育方法，选择内容有兴趣适合儿童的学习方法，过去是先生讲的多，现在是孩子亦编了组，按每个保育员带的孩子编成的，选了小组长，孩子管孩子，孩子哄孩子，起了很大作用，如发东西由组长发，大的给别人，小的自己留下，谁哭了，组长去哄，发扬了友爱互助精神。每天临睡前，可看到每个保育员同自己带的孩子说话，在树下小凳上，席子上，门槛上，保育员的怀里，热情亲切的说一天的生活，检讨了一天的优点和缺点。这也是新制度，可是起了很大作用。如过去有的孩子不起床，晚上说好明天起床比赛，谁起床不哭，孩子第二天果然不哭了。
    这就是我们立功中在工作上明显提高的表现。同志们都争着立功，特别是我们的饲养班长张记会同志是立功模范，为孩子们立了大功，他爱护牲口，牲口都喂的又光又胖，同时他的节约精神特别好，牲口喂得那么胖，而在六个月中，却节省二千三百斤料，三个牲口的料是四个牲口吃，不浪费一点草料，每天又节约五钱灯油，夜里喂牲口不点灯。他还救了一头奶牛，这是有关全所儿童每天牛奶供应的。那头牛头上长了疮生了蛆，他及时想办法洗、上药，不几天即全部好了。不然蛆进了脑子牛即完了。
    又如大班保育员房金梅同志，她对孩子的耐心、和霭、关心是作到了象自己的孩子、弟弟、妹妹一样的热情，使他那班的保育员也都是这样的对待孩子，其他各班各组都有功劳，现在大家正在争取下一次的立功旗。（周义、罗彦）
