Li Shunda Leads the Village in Improving Technology, Implements Contracted Second Weeding
[This newspaper PingShun News] To guarantee the third weeding, under the leadership of Li Shunda in the ShadiZhan Village, Second District, the village held a branch meeting immediately after the first weeding. During the discussion, everyone agreed that to realize the plan, there must be inspection, summarization, and commendation. On July 2nd, twelve technicians were organized into two groups for inspection. After the inspection, on the 8th of this month, a village-wide mutual aid meeting was held to exchange weeding experience. Everyone agreed to learn from Shunda's good techniques. After evaluation and commendation, Shunda and eight others were recognized for their contributions. On this high note, the whole village made a plan for the second and third weeding: The village has two brigades and eight mutual aid groups, with 62 households and 241 people participating, totaling 40 full laborers. They planted 213 mu of millet, requiring two labor days per mu for the second and third weeding. Eight mu of Bali millet required one and a half labor days per mu. Sixteen hundred and two mu of corn required two labor days per mu. Sixty mu of Jin Huanghou required two labor days per mu. Twenty-two mu of miscellaneous fields required one labor day per mu. The total labor required above was 900 days. Starting from the 21st day of the fifth lunar month and lasting until the 21st day of the sixth lunar month, there were 1,008 labor days available, excluding four sick individuals, leaving a surplus of 108 labor days. The village, besides small donkeys being born, also had fifteen animals capable of transportation. Seven people were assigned to drive the animals, requiring 210 labor days. After deducting the surplus of 108 labor days, there was still a shortage of 102 labor days. Therefore, the village discussed ways to catch up: (1) Contracting work; (2) Starting early and working late, going to the fields collectively at the sound of the bell, to make up for the shortage. Shunda's group took the lead in contracting work. The group has seven households. In the scoring, two people scored ten, two scored nine, three scored eight, one scored seven, and one scored six, totaling seven and a half full laborers. In evaluating the land, each person first stated how many labor days their land would require, and then the whole group judged. After such evaluation, the whole group contracted over 100 mu of corn and flower fields, etc. Except for two laborers being assigned to transportation, the plan was to complete the task in twelve days. The method was to weed one after another. Any remaining labor days would be distributed as work points, and any losses would be shared equally by the laborers. To improve technology, Niu Yunqing was responsible for daily inspection. Under the influence of Shunda's group, Zhang Laiquan's group and others also began to implement contracting work. The village's technology committee was convened to study the technology for the second and third weeding: (1) Remove the clipped millet; (2) Remove the reed hearts; (3) Remove the black knots; (4) Weed both horizontally and vertically. The method was to prioritize quality over speed, with each group having a technology committee member for frequent inspection; (5) Break the red bean vines. It was also discussed to have a general inspection three times within a month. After the masses established the criteria for recognition, Li Shunda challenged Zhang Laiquan, with the conditions: (1) Guarantee three weedings; (2) Improve technology; (3) Integrate with sideline occupations; (4) Implement contracting work; (5) Apply fertilizer to Jin Huanghou; (6) Complete on time. If not completed, the whole group will weed three mu for you. Zhang Laiquan's group accepted the challenge, and other groups also challenged each other. Each group selected judges. With everyone striving for recognition, the next day, the whole village began the second and third weeding, and the transportation personnel also set off at the same time. (Shuang Hong, Shi Xiu)
