Several Questions on Organizing
    Wu Xinghua Qin Tiande
    In our practical experience of the past few years, everyone has realized that organization has solved many difficulties, especially the difficulties of labor and livestock. However, due to insufficient timely summaries and exchanges of experience, especially the issues and solutions for mobilizing mutual aid teams, the masses reflect that organization is good, but mutual aid teams are somewhat unfree, restrictive, and troublesome, leading to losses. Therefore, this year's rectification of mutual aid organizations has presented us with many difficulties. To move the mutual aid teams forward, we are now introducing some of the problems and experiences discovered in the rectification of mutual aid in various counties.
    First, the current problems in mutual aid teams:
    I. This year, in terms of leadership in various counties, we boldly let the masses combine voluntarily, satisfying the masses' demands for compatible temperaments and tastes. However, upon inspection, there are still many mutual aid teams that are not entirely voluntary. This lack of voluntariness (or limited voluntariness) is essentially different from the past. In the past, it was purely based on the pursuit of quantity, so it was expressed as "compilation" in practice and "formality" in organizational scale. This year, it has new objective circumstances.
    A: During the tense spring plowing and sowing, everyone was busy participating in the war. As the masses said, the front line is making contributions in the war, and we in the rear should make contributions in production. Under the encouragement of this sentiment, mutual aid teams were organized without violating the seasonal requirements. For example, in Yuan Gu County, mutual aid teams were organized by region when preparing to participate in the war and plant beautiful cotton.
    B: Due to the influence of organization in the old liberated areas, the masses in the new liberated areas have thoughts such as reporting, seeking favor, fearing falling behind, and wanting to catch up with the old liberated areas. Coupled with some cadres' task-completion mentality, mutual aid teams were generally established.
    It can be seen from the above that many mutual aid organizations are established on the basis of enthusiastic encouragement. Historical experience proves that this will inevitably collapse in the long run. Only through true ideological organization, conscious and voluntary combination on a certain economic basis, can the power of the organization be consolidated and brought into play.
    II. In terms of equivalent exchange, the masses are afraid of suffering losses when participating in mutual aid, but on the other hand, they emphasize the generosity of farmers being one family. There is a lack of research on equivalent methods based on specific circumstances. For example, Tai Gu had the understanding last year that "suffering losses and gaining advantages are all within the family," so it was reflected that some people benefited and some were burdened. Those who benefited did not speak up, and those who were burdened were dissatisfied. This phenomenon exists in various counties, but even after equivalence, the exchange is not timely. In clearing up equivalence, wages owed from last year have not yet been settled, especially for village cadres. This phenomenon is common, reflecting "suffering losses this time" (I won't be with you again), causing mutual opinions and no one mentioning it.
    III. In the establishment of systems, although they have been discussed and researched, their implementation is formal and coercive. For example, the leave system and meeting system feel restrictive and unfree, especially in the new liberated areas.
    IV. Fearing becoming heroes and team leaders, the leadership is not good at promoting special skills. Heroes play a backbone role in production, but they are required to be models in everything, so there is a reflection of not being able to be heroes and not being able to be glorious.
    The above four points are the major problems in the current mobilization of mutual aid teams. We must rectify them to improve the movement. The experiences of various counties in rectifying mutual aid teams are:
    Second, an introduction to the experience of rectifying mutual aid teams:
    (I) Boldly let the masses combine voluntarily. Letting the masses combine voluntarily will inevitably lead to the phenomenon of soldiers pairing with soldiers and generals pairing with generals. This should not be feared, because in people's interactions, who is good and who is bad, who is honest and who is cunning, who is reliable and who is unreliable, who can work together and who cannot, the masses have a thorough understanding. Because mutual trust is different, the masses should be allowed to choose the people they trust and combine voluntarily based on their daily personal experience, so that they can be satisfied. Such organization is built on the basis of mutual trust and is extremely easy to consolidate.
    Secondly, due to the masses' lack of knowledge of equivalent exchange, they can only handle the conditions of soldiers pairing with soldiers and generals pairing with generals at the beginning, and they can only have the ability to exchange without significant differences. More complex relationships cannot be handled.
    Therefore, when organizing, we must take into account the masses' level of mutual aid knowledge and the actual mutual trust between each person. Some places, while letting the masses combine voluntarily, also emphasize transforming and taking care of cunning people, lazy people, widows, small merchants, idlers, and village cadres who are disliked by the masses, forcing them into the group. As a result, people who voluntarily organized lose heart, and it is still forced. The twelve teams of the three major brigades in He Shun Beiguan are 100% organized, but there is no action, which is a mistake of semi-voluntary and semi-forced. Conversely, Dongguan insisted on the principle of absolute voluntariness, letting the masses combine voluntarily, immediately gathering the advancing elements on the production front (those who dare to get rich, love labor, have skills, have labor power, and are honest), forming a leading force. For example, in Xiang Yuan Xi Bang County, when planting beautiful cotton, the mutual aid teams were organized by region, and the masses were dissatisfied. During the rectification of mutual aid, the masses were allowed to promote free thought and combine voluntarily, resulting in isolating the cunning, selfish ×××. It was during the rush of sowing. The next day, one person went to the field, unable to plow or sow, and cried, feeling that there was no way to do it alone. Later, after reflecting in the night school that they should not be cunning, they were allowed to rejoin the mutual aid. In this way, under voluntary combination, cunning and lazy people with bad consciousness who rely on eating the cheap food of mutual aid were excluded and isolated. This exclusion and isolation is education. For example, the eight families of musicians who were isolated in He Shun Dongguan were determined not to be lazy and combined together, challenging and competing with public security officer Yu Shuangxian. There were also seven cunning people who were not convinced and challenged the village chief's advanced team in production. Those with poor skills and weak labor power who were squeezed out also organized and joined the movement. Secondly, households without labor power, after education and solving the problem of equivalence, did not leave their land barren.
    In addition, for those who stubbornly adhere to individual production and are not conscious, our policy is of course to let them be. There is only one truth. When he sees the achievements of mutual aid and recognizes the mass power of organization, he will change. Recalling the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, some places could not be organized, but some villages, under the leadership of labor heroes, did a very good job from small to large. The main reason for their success or failure is whether to let go of voluntary combination or not. This is the main manifestation of whether the implementation of the organization policy follows the mass line. We should check according to this principle of letting go of combination and overcome the phenomena of coercion or semi-coercion and semi-voluntariness. According to the requirements and preferences of the masses and the people they are most willing to work with, we should re-organize voluntarily and implement the principle of voluntariness.
    (II) Taking poor and hired peasants as the backbone to unite with middle peasants. Taking newly emancipated poor and hired peasants as the backbone, while uniting with middle peasants, and cultivating new poor and hired peasant heroes to lead the large-scale production movement, is a new development in the construction of the mutual aid movement. Because after the land reform, poor and hired peasants were emancipated and obtained land, their production naturally greatly improved, and their demands for production exceeded any class. The middle peasant masses lagged behind the newly emancipated poor and hired peasants in terms of awareness and production enthusiasm after the movement, and even had concerns (they cannot unite with peasants for production on the basis of active awareness). Half a year of experience proves that the place that recognizes and grasps this characteristic, relies on poor and hired peasants to unite with middle peasants, draws a clear class line, and cultivates new poor and hired peasant backbone heroes and cadres to lead production, will have great production strength. Otherwise, the production movement cannot be launched, and even if it is launched, it will collapse. For example, the fourth district brigade of Yu She, with emancipated peasants as the main force, combined with middle peasants, organized mutual aid teams, drew a clear class line, and relied on the peasants' association to carry out activities and discuss and solve production problems. Therefore, the cadres were united, actively leading, and the style was democratic, and the production enthusiasm exceeded any year. Xi Shan Village used to be an advanced production village in Yu She, but because the production leader this year was a middle-rich peasant, the movement was not thorough, the class line was not clear, and the composition of the peasants and hired laborers was not pure. Therefore, this year's production not only did not maintain its original state, but instead decreased. Therefore, we should recognize this change with a new perspective (the improvement of the ideological awareness and organizational awareness of poor and hired peasants after the land reform), and rely on this new production force to become the backbone of uniting middle peasants for production.
    (III) We must disseminate equivalent experience. The methods of equivalent exchange vary from place to place. Some use labor power, and some use the rising and setting of the sun to determine work. This method does not greatly stimulate everyone's enthusiasm. Live evaluation is good, but there is no suitable standard for evaluation, and it is difficult to evaluate according to the standard. Some are forced to talk about organization. Although there is a scoring committee, there is no good method. If a suitable standard score can be found, anyone can evaluate fairly without any objections. According to the experience of advanced villages in He Shun, the standard is the average output that one person should do in a day. Those who exceed it are given extra points, and those who do not exceed it are given deductions. For example, giving ××× manure to Xi Shan, according to working hours, each person can run ten times a day, so ten times is counted as one work (ie, one work is ten points). For example, ××× giving manure to the village, usually each person sends fifty times a day, so fifty times is counted as one work (each work is ten points), one load is two cents, more loads are added, and fewer loads are subtracted. This year, under the circumstances of supporting the front line and the lack of labor and livestock, timely organizing auxiliary labor to participate in production is a new experience in organizing labor to participate in production this year. Various places have made many creations in organizing auxiliary labor to participate in production. Here, special attention is paid to a problem, that is, the reward and dividend issues for auxiliary labor participating in production. In addition to equivalence, there are still many biases and shortcomings in exchange in various places, such as exchanging busy work for short idle work, and exchanging low prices for high prices. Various counties should correct this bias in the current rectification of mutual aid teams. There are also unfair phenomena in exchange, such as equivalence without exchange and untimely exchange. The masses in Wu Xiang reflect: equivalence without exchange is in vain for mutual aid. Therefore, we should pay special attention to this in rectifying mutual aid.
    (IV) We must democratically formulate plans. The purpose of formulating plans is to overcome blindness in production. According to the experience of He Shun, there are two types of plans: The first type is the plan for each household's annual struggle goals; the second type is the plan for arranging the daily labor sequence of the entire group, such as when to do what, who will do it, calculate labor, and handle surplus labor. For example, the Gou Bu Si team, with a total of seven households, studied the early planting of grain as soon as the plowing started, how much time each household should spend planting, and also allocated work according to the task. After careful calculation, they used the surplus labor of the entire group to adjust livestock power with other groups, overcoming the livestock power difficulties within the group. Making plans like this does not fail, and at the same time, it is necessary to launch a competition among the groups to become rich and ensure the completion of the plan.
    In order to combine agricultural and sideline production with rewarding diligence throughout the year, labor, livestock, tools, technicians, full labor, semi-labor, auxiliary labor, military workers, retired soldiers, lazy people, and idlers should all be organized into mutual aid teams, with various labor forces organizing different production, expanding the scope of mutual aid organizations (on the basis of equivalent exchange), and making mutual aid better.

　　组织起来几个问题
    武兴华　秦天德
    我们几年来的实际体验中，大家已体会到组织起来解决了不少困难，特别劳畜力的困难，但由于及时的总结与交流经验不够，特别是发动互助组的问题与解决不够及时，因而群众反映组织起来是好，但是互助组有些不自由拘束麻烦吃亏，因而今年在整顿互助组织上，给了我们不少困难。为了互助组推前一步，现将各县整顿互助中发现的一些问题与经验分别介绍如下。
    第一、目前互助组存在问题：
    一、今年各县领导上由于大胆放手让群众自觉自愿的结合，满足了群众对脾气合口味的要求；但检查起来，还有不少的互助组存在着不够自愿的现象，这种不自愿性（或自愿性不大）和过去亦有本质上的不同。过去是单纯建立在追求数量上，因而表现在作法上是“编制”，在组织规模上是“形式”，而今年则有他新的客观情况。
    甲：春耕下种紧张时，正忙于参战，正如群众所说，前方参战立功，咱们后方生产要助耕立功，在这种情绪鼓舞下在不违反时节季下组织起来，如垣故县在准备参战与种美丽棉花时互助组就按地区编起来。
    乙：由于老区组织起来的响影，新区群众存在报、恩时髦、怕落后、想追上老区等思想，加以干部有些完成任务观点，因而普遍的成立了互助组。
    从以上看出，不少互助组织，建立在热情鼓舞上。历史经验证明持久下去必然会垮，只有真正的思想组织自觉，从一定的经济基础上民主自愿结合，才能巩固与发挥组织威力。
    二、在等价交换上，群众参加互助，思想上怕吃亏，但另一方面是天下农民是一家强调涵厚，缺乏根据具体情况研究出等价办法，如太谷去年有“吃亏便宜都是一家人”的认识，因此反映有沾光有背伤，沾光的不吭气，背伤的不满意。这种现象各县都有，但既等价后，交换上又不及时。在清理等价上，去年拖欠工资至今还有未算清，特别是村干部，这种现象很多，反映“吃亏就是这一次”（下次再不和你在一块），造成互有意见谁也不提。
    三、在制度建立上，虽然也经过了讨论研究，但在执行上是形式的强制的，例如请假制会议制感到拘束不自由，特别是新区。
    四、怕当英雄、组长，领导上不善于发扬一技之长，英雄在生产上起骨干带领作用，而是处处事事要求起模范，所以有当不起英雄，光荣不了之反映。
    以上四点，就是目前互助组动员的较大问题，我们必须加以整顿，使运动提高一步。各县整顿互助经验是：
    第二、整顿互助组经验介绍：
    （一）大胆放手让群众自愿结合问题，让群众自愿结合必然要产生兵对兵将对将现象，这点不应惧怕，因为人与人的交处，平时谁好谁坏，谁忠厚谁尖头，谁可靠谁不可靠，谁可共谁不可共，群众都有透澈的了解，因为相互间的信赖不同，因此在组织起来时应让群众凭其素日切身经验选择自己所信任的人自愿结合，才得到心满意足，这样的组织起来，是建立在互助信赖基础上，也极容易巩固。
    其次，由于群众相互等价知识缺乏，开始也只能处理兵对兵将对将条件，也只能有互相不差上下的等价能力，再复杂的关系就处理不了。
    所以在组织起来时，必须照顾群众互助知识的水平和每人相互之间的信赖实际。有些地方一面让群众自愿结合，一面又将群众不喜爱的挤出来的尖头赖汉孤寡小商游闲的村干部，强调改造照顾，硬插在小组内，结果自愿组织起来的人们泄了气，还是强迫。和顺北关三大队十二组百分之百的组织起来，但没有行动，就是犯了半自愿半强迫的毛病。反之东关坚持了绝对自愿的原则，放手让群众自愿结合，立刻使生产战线上的行进分子（敢发财、爱劳动、有技术、有劳力、忠厚）聚集在一起，形成了带头力量。再如襄垣西帮县村种美丽棉花时，互助组按地区编制，群众不满意，在整顿互助时让群众发扬自由思想自愿结合，结果把俏皮尖自私的×××孤立出来，时正在突击下种中，第二天一人到地既不能耕又不能种，抱头痛哭，感到一个人没办法，后在夜校反省不该俏皮尖头，又让重新参加互助，这样在自愿结合下，意识不好的尖头懒汉靠吃互助便宜饭的人便受到了排挤和孤立，这种排挤孤立，就是教育。又如和顺东关被孤立出来的八家吹鼓手，决心不当懒汉，结合在一起，和公安员于双先进行挑战竞赛，还有七家尖头，也不服气，和村长先进组生产挑战，还有挤出来的技术差劳力弱的也组织起来卷入了运动，其次无劳力户经过了教育，解决了等价问题，土地也没有荒芜。
    另外固守个体生产不自觉的人，我们的政策当然听其自然，真理只有一个，当他看到互助作出成绩时，认识到组织起来的群众力量，他曾有所转变的。回忆八年抗日过程中，有的地方搞不起来，有的村，在劳英领导下，由小而大搞的很好，其成功失败经验教训，放手自愿结合与不放手自愿结合是个主要原因，这是贯彻组织起来政策是否走群众路线的主要表现，我们应根据这个放手结合的原则检查一下，把强迫，或半强迫半自愿的现象加以克服，根据群众的要求爱好和最乐意的人，重新自愿的组织起来，贯彻自愿的原则。
    （二）以贫雇为骨干团结中农问题，以新翻身贫雇农为骨干，同时团结中农，培养新的贫雇出身英雄领导大生产运动，这是互助运动建设上一个新的发展，由于经过了土地改革，贫雇翻了身获得了土地生产自然大大提高，对生产要求超过任何阶层，而中农群众则因运动后觉悟程度生产情绪都赶不上新翻身的贫雇，甚至还有顾虑（不能在积极觉悟基础上团结农民生产）。半年经验证明，那个地方认识了掌握了这个特点，依靠贫雇团结中农，划清阶级界线培养新的贫雇骨干英雄干部领导生产，那个地方生产就劲大，反之生产运动就开展不起来，即使起来也要垮。如榆社四区大队以翻身农民为主，结合中农，组织了互助组，划清了阶级界线，依靠农会进行活动，讨论解决生产问题，因此干部都团结一致，积极领导，作风民主生产劲头超任何一年。西山村过去是榆社生产先进村，但由于今年生产领导者是中富农，运动没有彻底，阶级界线没划清，农雇成份不纯，因此今年生产不但没保持原状，相反降低了，因此我们应以新的观点去认识这一变化（土地改革后贫雇思想自觉与组织自觉的提高），依托这批新生产力量成为团结中农生产的中坚。
    （三）必须传播等价经验，各地等价交换办法不同，有的按劳力，有的按太阳起落来订工，这种办法，对大家积极性发挥不大。活评到好，但评议没有一个合适标准，对标准评议感到为难，有的逼着组织谈，虽有评分委员会，亦没有一个好的办法。如果能够找出一个合适标准分，谁都可以评的公道，没有意见。根据和顺先进村的经验，是按平均一人一日做什么活所应做的成果为标准，超过者加分，不超过者减分。例如给×××往西山送粪，照工时每人每日可跑十次，那么十次算一工（即一工十分），又如×××往村边送粪，平常每人每日送五十次，那么五十次就算一工（每工十分），一担即二厘，多担者加，少担者减。今年在支援前线及劳畜力缺乏情况下，及时组织辅助劳力参加生产，是我们今年组织劳力参加生产的一个新的经验。各地组织辅助劳力参加生产都有不少的创造，这里特别注意一个问题，即是辅助劳力参加生产的奖励与分红问题，除等价外，在交换上各地仍有不少的偏向与缺点，如忙工短闲工还，低价短于高价换等。各县在目前整顿互助组中，应纠正这种偏向。在交换上，亦存在着不公道现象，如等价不交换及交换不及时。武乡群众反映：等价不交换，互助也枉然。因此我们在整顿互助上应特别注意。
    （四）必须民主订定计划。订定计划的目的，在于克服生产上的盲目性，根据和顺的经验，计划有两种：第一种属于每户终年奋斗目标的计划；第二种是全组每日劳动次序的按排计划，如什么时候该干啥，谁去干，计算劳动力，处理剩余劳力。例如狗不死组，全组七户，一开犁就研究谷要早种，各家种多少时间，亦要按活分配，经过周密计算，拿全组剩余劳力和别组调剂畜力，克服了组内的畜力困难。这样做计划不落空，同时要掀起各组的发家竞赛，保证计划完成。
    为了把农副业生产与奖勤结合贯穿全年，应把劳畜力工具技术人员，男女全劳力、半劳力、辅助劳力以及军工属荣退军人懒汉游民等均组织到互助组内，以各种劳力组织不同的生产，扩大互助组织面（在等价交换基础上），把互助搞的更好些。
