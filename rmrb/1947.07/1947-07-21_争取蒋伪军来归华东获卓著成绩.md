Xinhua News Agency, Central China, July 17th: "Chiang Army Homecoming Reception Centers" are a new creation by the masses in northern Jiangsu in the movement to win over and disintegrate Chiang's puppet troops. After the Lu'nan Campaign this spring, large numbers of Chiang's troops in northern Jiangsu fled, wanting to return to the Liberated Areas, but worried, "Will the New Fourth Army and the common people be lenient?" The democratic governments of Si(yang) and Shu(yang) counties first established "Chiang Army Homecoming Reception Centers" near Chiang's military strongholds. The interiors were covered with propaganda charts, and wooden signs hung outside. On the day of its establishment, coinciding with a market day, a meeting was held to welcome Chiang's soldiers who had already escaped, report on the crimes of Chiang's army and their desire to return home, and announce the significance of establishing the "Reception Center" on the spot, calling on the masses to strive for the meritorious service of Chiang's puppet soldiers. Afterwards, every market day, they broadcast to the public, introducing the situation of the Chiang's soldiers being received. Chiang's soldiers who returned also wrote letters to their former comrades, telling them about their experience of being received, and established "Reception Sub-centers" in various places, distributing leaflets to Chiang's military strongholds and highways, marking the path to the "Reception Center." As the news spread, the number of Chiang's soldiers returning increased sharply. One day, eighteen soldiers from the 65th Division of Chiang's army came, led by squad leader Liu Yimei, and all went to the "Reception Center." After hearing the accusations of Chiang's soldiers and seeing the results of the lenient policy, the masses took rescuing Chiang's puppet soldiers as their own task. Many children often moved along both sides of the highway, and when they saw straggling Chiang's soldiers, they would call out, "Big hat soldiers, the reception center will send you home." On one occasion, seven children jointly called in a Chiang's soldier. The reactionaries hated the "Reception Center" to the bone. Chiang's 65th Division once concentrated hundreds of troops to sneak into a certain "Reception Center", but after the Chiang's soldiers visited the pictures and slogans, the desertion became even worse. Now this kind of "Reception Center" has been widely set up in Si-Shu, Suqian, and Tongyang counties. Within five months, a total of 1,132 Chiang's soldiers have been received.
    Xinhua News Agency, Central China, July 17th: The movement to strive for Chiang's puppet soldiers to perform meritorious service and redeem their crimes in the Dongtai (East) and Taipei areas of central Jiangsu has achieved remarkable results. According to statistics from February to June, 3,440 local Chiang's puppet soldiers have been won over, accounting for two-thirds of the total number of Chiang's puppet soldiers in the area, including twelve who came with their weapons. As early as the Lunar New Year, the area launched a political offensive combined with armed struggle, printing more than 500 kinds of propaganda materials, about 500,000 copies. Chiang's puppet soldiers became increasingly shaken, either returning, fleeing elsewhere, or expressing their attitude to us and asking for leniency. Therefore, our democratic government further proposed a movement for Chiang's puppet soldiers to perform meritorious service and redeem their crimes, calling for them to defect with their guns and for the families of puppet soldiers to persuade them to return. A "Committee for Investigating the Merits and Crimes of the Enemy" was organized in the border areas to mobilize the masses to accuse, launching a mass political offensive combined with review, eliminating traitors, and armed struggle. At this time, those who had gone astray and joined Chiang regretted and returned in large numbers, expressing their willingness to redeem their crimes and no longer do evil. Chiang's officials even presented important materials to the democratic government, asking for "certificates of offsetting crimes with merits." The masses in Libao Township even set up a "Registration Book for Chiang's Soldiers Returning Home from the War," and 54 people have now registered to return home.

　　争取蒋伪军来归华东获卓著成绩
    【新华社华中十七日电】“蒋军来归招待所”是苏北蒋后群众性的争取瓦解蒋伪运动的新创造。今春鲁南战役后，苏北蒋军大批逃亡，想回解放区，但又顾虑“新四军和老百姓会不会宽大呢？”泗（阳）沭（阳）县民主政府乃首先于蒋军据点附近设立“蒋军来归招待所”，室内遍贴宣传图表，门外高悬木牌。成立之日，适逢集期，即召开大会，欢迎已逃出之蒋军，报告蒋军罪恶及渴望回家心情，并当场宣布成立“招待所”意义，号召群众争取蒋伪立功。以后，每次逢集，就向大众广播，介绍受招待蒋军情形。来归蒋军亦纷纷写信告其归日伙伴以蒙受招待经过，并在各处设立“招待分所”，向蒋军据点及公路上散发标明到“招待所”路径的传单。消息传播开去，蒋军来归数目。激增有一天就来了十八个蒋军六五师一个班，在班长刘以美率领下全部投奔“招待所”。群众听到蒋军的控诉，看到宽大政策的成绩后，也就把解救蒋伪当作自己的任务。许多儿童经常在公路两侧活动，看到掉队蒋军，就招呼：“大帽子兵，到招待所送你回家。”某次七个儿童就联合喊来了一个蒋军。反动派对“招待所”则恨之入骨。蒋军六五师曾集中数百兵力窜抵某地“招待所”，但蒋军士兵们参观了一遍图画标语后，逃亡更甚。现在此种“招待所”已遍设于泗沭、宿迁、潼阳等县，五个月内，共收容蒋军一千一百三十二名。
    【新华社华中十七日电】苏中东台（东）台北地区争取蒋伪立功赎罪运动，成效卓著。据二月至六月的五个月统计，已争取三千四百四十名土著蒋伪来归，占该地区蒋伪总数三分之二，其中有十二人并系携械来归。早在旧历年关，该区即展开了与武装斗争相结合的政治攻势，先后印刷宣传品五百余种，约五十余万份，蒋伪日趋动摇，或来归或他逃，或向我表明态度，要求宽大。于是，我民主政府便进一步向蒋伪提出立功赎罪运动，号召拖枪反正，号召伪属劝归。并于边缘区组织“对敌功罪调查委员会”，发动群众控诉，掀起群众性的政治攻势与复查、锄奸、武装斗争结合进行。此时，失足附蒋分子更大量悔悟来归。纷纷表示戴罪立功，不再作恶。蒋记官吏并亲献民主政府重要物资，要求发给“将功折罪证”。李堡边乡群众更设置“罢战回乡蒋军登记簿”，现已有五十四人登记回乡。
