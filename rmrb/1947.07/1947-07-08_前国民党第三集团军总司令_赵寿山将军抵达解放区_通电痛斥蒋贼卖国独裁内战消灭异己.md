Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 6th - General Zhao Shoushan, former Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang Third Army, arrived in the Liberated Area recently after breaking free from close surveillance by secret agents. He opposes Chiang Kai-shek’s treachery, dictatorship, civil war, and elimination of dissidents. He was reunited with General Kong Congzhou of the 55th Division and General Liu Weicheng of the 17th Division, formerly of the 38th Army (Zhao once served as the army commander), who had previously launched an anti-civil war uprising in Luoning and Gongxian. Bo Yibo of the CCP Jinji Luyu Central Bureau and Deputy Commanders of the Military Region, Teng Daiyuan and Wang Hongkun, personally welcomed him. Generals Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping, who had just returned from the front line, also visited to express their regards. General Zhao expressed extreme indignation at the various oppressions suffered by the 38th Army under Chiang Kai-shek's policy of eliminating dissidents. He felt infinite comfort at the development and growth of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army's 38th Army, which was established after the uprising, with the full assistance of the military and civilians in the Liberated Area. He said: From now on, all officers and soldiers of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army's 38th Army will fight alongside the People's Liberation Army for the liberation of the Northwest and the realization of an independent, free, and happy New China. It is an exciting news that General Zhao Shoushan, who Chiang Kai-shek wanted to send abroad to the United States a year ago to eliminate dissidents, broke away from the surveillance of secret agents and traveled a long and arduous journey to the Liberated Area, especially after his close friends Mr. Du Bincheng and others were arrested or harmed by Chiang Kai-shek's secret service.

General Zhao Shoushan's Circular Telegram

Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 6th - General Zhao Shoushan, former Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang Third Army, issued a circular telegram to all sectors of the country, the text of which is as follows:

Since the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the people of the whole country have longed for peace and democracy. Mr. Mao Zedong, leader of the Chinese Communist Party, went to Chongqing to negotiate on this basis, and various parties gathered in Chongqing to negotiate on this matter. When the resolutions of the Fifth National Congress and the Three Major Agreements were announced, the whole nation rejoiced, and the world celebrated. I, Shoushan, who survived the war, felt particularly encouraged. Everyone knows that only peace can lead to construction, only democracy can lead to unity, and only peace and democracy can make China an independent, free, and happy country. Those who follow this will succeed, and those who go against it will fail. The iron law is clear and allows no deviation. Unexpectedly, Chiang Kai-shek is obsessed with dictatorship and indulges in civil war. At first, he used political negotiations and military mediation to gain time for war preparation. Then, he recognized thieves as fathers, sold out interests, and obtained the support of American imperialism. Finally, the smoke screen of peace talks still lingered, the ink of the signatures was not yet dry, and the flames of civil war had fully erupted. In order to maintain his own dictatorial rule, he did not hesitate to rely on American imperialism to kill each other, and he refused to use unlimited manpower for production but for civil war, and unlimited financial resources not for construction but for artillery fire. He sat idly by while the country was plunged into an unprecedentedly serious crisis, and the nation was in an irrecoverable situation. If he were not insane, how could he have acted so perversely? I thought that Chiang Kai-shek might have been ignorant of the strength of the Chinese Communist Party, ignorant of the development of the situation at home and abroad, and believed that the Eighth Route Army was vulnerable and that the Soviet-American war would come soon. Therefore, he must wait for a test of strength on the battlefield. Only after a major defeat and the avoidance of the Soviet-American war, could he change his mind and embark on the path of true peace and democracy. However, the civil war has been going on for almost a year, and the number of annihilated brigades has increased. Yet, he is still stubborn and unrepentant. Looking at the recent inflation, soaring prices, and bankruptcy of industry and commerce in the Chiang-controlled areas, as well as the increasingly unbearable lives of public servants, educators and the masses. Looking at the recent strikes by workers, student strikes, rice snatching by citizens, popular uprisings, and the increasingly ineffective arrests, imprisonments, and massacres by Chiang's secret agents, it can be seen that he, the traitorous, dictatorial instigator of the civil war, is now in a state of crisis on all sides. Regardless of what struggles he may still make, his fate of destruction is sealed, and it will not be long before it comes. This can be asserted.

Shoushan has served in the military for more than thirty years. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, I originally intended to travel abroad and enjoy my remaining years if the country could achieve peace and democracy. Or I would live as a commoner and die peacefully in my old age. Moreover, I am originally a member of the Kuomintang and have long been influenced by Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. Now, I am old, what else do I seek? My resolute decision to come to the Liberated Area to cooperate with the Chinese Communist Party is indeed due to unavoidable hardships. First, when parents are sick in bed, children are cautious and fearful. Now that the motherland is suffering another catastrophe, how can I live comfortably on the sidelines and remain indifferent? Second, the elders in the Northwest have been living under the iron hooves of Chiang Kai-shek for more than ten years, living the lives of slaves and beasts. Compared with the war, they are suffering even more. The liberation of my hometown is an unavoidable duty. Third, my superior General Yang Hucheng devoted himself to the revolution and made outstanding achievements. However, he was imprisoned for ten years because of the "Xi'an Incident," and his fate is still unknown. His troops have also been subjected to oppression, division, disintegration, and usurpation. My close friends, such as Du Bincheng, Wang Juren, Xu Quanzhong, and Li Furen, have been arrested and killed in recent years, no less than dozens of people. The families of the victims all hope that I can avenge them. All these reasons, whether public or private, do not allow me to escape responsibility and travel far overseas on this day when the motherland is suffering deeply. Therefore, since I was ordered to go abroad, I hesitated for a year before coming here. Now, I announce several things as guidelines for the future: 1. I am determined to take resolute action to oppose the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary government's policy of selling out the country, dictatorship, and civil war to the end. 2. To promptly convene consultations with various democratic parties to restore the CPPCC line and organize a unified national coalition government. 3. To implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary proposition of "land to the tillers." I am determined to work hard to achieve the above, and I firmly believe that the general trend and the will of the people will make these goals achievable. Whether you know me or blame me, I do not care. I dare to ask for your public judgment.

　　前国民党第三集团军总司令
  　赵寿山将军抵达解放区
    通电痛斥蒋贼卖国独裁内战消灭异己
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫六日电】前国民党第三集团军总司令赵寿山将军，为反对蒋介石卖国独裁内战消灭异己，摆脱特务多方监视，已于日前辗转抵达解放区。与前在洛宁、巩县反对内战起义的前赵将军所属三十八军（赵曾任军长）五十五师孔从周将军、十七师刘威诚将军等军获团聚。中共晋冀鲁豫中央局薄一波，军区副司令员滕代远、王宏坤均亲往欢迎。刚由前线归来的刘伯承、邓小平两将军，亦前往慰问。赵将军对过去三十八军在蒋介石消灭异己政策下所受种种压迫，表示非常愤慨，而对起义后成立的西北民主联军三十八军目前在解放区军民全力帮助下所获得发展与壮大，则感到无限的安慰。他说：今后西北民主联军三十八军全体将士，决与人民解放军一道，为解放西北与实现独立自由幸福的新中国而奋斗。按蒋介石为排除异己，一年前即要赵将军出洋到美国去，赵将军在其亲密友人杜斌丞先生等被蒋介石特务机关加以拘捕或加残害时，脱离特务监视，间关远道前来解放区，实属令人兴奋之消息。
    赵寿山将军通电
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫六日电】前国民党第三集团军总司令赵寿山将军致全国各界通电，原文如下：
    慨自日寇投降以还，全国人民莫不渴望和平民主，中共领袖毛泽东先生曾以此赴渝会谈于先，各党派又以此集渝协商于后。迨自五大决议、三大协定公布之日，全民腾跃，举世欢庆，而寿山以歼敌余生，尤感奋发。盖世人皆知唯和平乃能建设，唯民主乃能统一，亦唯和平民主乃能使中国成为独立自由幸福之国家；顺此者成，逆此者败，铁则所示，不容或爽。讵料蒋介石醉心独裁，恣意内战，其始也以政治谈判，军事调处赢得备战之时间；其继也以认贼作父，出卖权益，取得美帝国主义之支援；其终也和谈之烟幕仍滞，签字之墨迹未干，而内战之烽火则已全面爆发矣。彼竟为维护一己之独裁统治，不惜媚靠美帝自相残杀，忍将无限人力不用于生产而用于内战，无限财力不投之建设而投之炮火，坐使国家造成空前严重危机，民族陷于不复之境而不顾，倘非丧心病狂，其何倒行逆施至于此耶。意者蒋介石初或昧于中共力量之强大，昧于中外情势之发展，认为八路车不堪一击，美苏战争速即来临，故必待战场一较身手；大打败仗，及美苏战争竟得避免之后，方可回心转意，步入真正和平民主之途，乃内战迳行倏将一年，被歼之旅，亦以进数，而彼犹顽强不悟，毫无悔祸之意。观于最近蒋管区之通货膨胀，物价飞涨，工商破产，以及公教人员与人民大众之益不聊生；观于最近蒋管区之工人罢工，学生罢课，市民抢米，民变蜂起以及蒋特之逮捕、监禁、屠杀种种手段之益见无效，尚可知彼篡党卖国内战之大独裁者，刻已处于四面楚歌危机四伏之中。姑无论其尚祈作若何挣扎，但覆亡命运已定，且为期不远，此则可断言者。
    寿山效命行间，三十余载，抗战胜利后，原想国事倘得和平民主，即拟出国悠游，以享余年；或长为太平之民，老死牖下，况夫余本国民党员，素沐中山主义，今垂垂老矣，尚何所求？余今毅然来解放区与中共合作，实亦有不得不尔之苦衷在焉。第一，父母卧病床第，游子且存戒惧；今祖国重罹浩劫，余岂能独自逍遥局外，漠然无动于衷乎！？第二，西父老在蒋胡铁蹄下，度其奴隶牛马生活，已十余年于兹矣，比以战祸，益使水深火热，解放桑梓，义不容辞。第三，余之长官杨虎城将军，尽瘁革命，卓著功绩，祗以“双十二”兵谏，禁锢十载，至今生死不明，其部队又横遭压迫分化瓦解并篡夺以去，余之至友如杜斌丞、王菊人、许权中、李敷仁等，年来被拘捕杀害者，亦不下数十人，被害家属咸望余能为之复仇雪恨。凡此种种，无论为公为私，均不容当此祖国灾难深重之日，逃避责任，远涉重洋也。故自受命出国以来，为时一年，几作踌躇，始行来此。兹揭橥数事，藉作今后方针：一、余决以坚决行动，反对蒋介石反动政府之卖国独裁内战政策到底。二、迅速召集各民主党派会商，恢复政协路线，组织全国一致之联合政府。三、实行孙中山先生耕者有其田的革命主张。以上数事，余决当努力以赴，并确信大势所趋，人心所向，此种目标决可达到。知我罪我，在所不计，区区此心，敢请公鉴。
