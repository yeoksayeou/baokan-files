　　[This article was] transmitted by Taiyue on the 7th of this month: Qinshui Second School District teachers held a forum on the 16th. The entire body formulated a plan to render meritorious service, aiming for all fifteen schools to be self-sufficient in terms of public funding. Regarding drought prevention and famine preparedness, everyone also offered guarantees: First, they will organize and mobilize all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied men and women in the villages to go to the fields together for a concentrated effort to hoe seedlings. Second, they will practice strict economy, starting with themselves and then promoting it throughout the village. Li Ruming, Zheng Yulong, and others proposed saving six liang of millet per day, and the remaining teachers also proposed saving four liang of millet per person per day. It is estimated that from July to the end of the year, a total of 765 jin of millet can be saved, half for famine preparedness and half for turning over to the public. Third, they will guarantee to lead all 789 students in the school district to collect ten jin (dry weight) of wild vegetables and store three jin of bran per person without affecting production or study. Fourth, in order to overcome the shortage of labor, each teacher will proactively help the dependents of soldiers and martyrs who lack labor to hoe seedlings and carry water.
