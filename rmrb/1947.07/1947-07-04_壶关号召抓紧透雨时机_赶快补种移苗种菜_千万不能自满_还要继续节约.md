　　[Our Newspaper News] The Huguan leadership is calling on the entire county to seize the opportunity of rainfall to quickly replant, transplant seedlings, and plant vegetables, absolutely avoid complacency, and continue to economize to prevent disaster. The call states: Due to the lack of rain throughout the spring, sowing in many villages has been affected, resulting in incomplete seedlings in the fields and many empty spaces. Fortunately, on June 21st and 22nd, most parts of the county received soaking rain, which everyone is naturally happy about. However, this year's wheat harvest is reduced by half, basically avoiding a disaster. Moreover, one rain is difficult to decide everything. We cannot be complacent. We should continue to make long-term plans under the call for production, economization, and disaster prevention. At present, we must seize the opportunity to quickly carry out important agricultural tasks such as replanting, transplanting seedlings, planting vegetables, and weeding, striving not to lack a single seedling, not to leave a single empty field, and to overcome nature in everything to strive for a bumper harvest. In particular, cotton-growing areas should study the third phase of weeding, and the successful experience of seedling transplantation tested in county fields published in the Textile Gazette should be quickly promoted. In order to achieve the above goals, districts and villages should further develop the experience of mutual assistance and large-scale work exchange in this year's spring plowing and sowing, organize all labor, specifically divide tasks, maximize labor efficiency, combine efforts, and complete replanting and weeding on time. (Huguan Weeding Textile Gazette)
    [Our Newspaper Jinan Second Daily Electric] To specifically solve the difficulties of plowing cattle and labor, 150,000 mu in the Enxian flood area has been replanted. Due to low-lying terrain, 16 villages including Buguantun in the Third District suffered repeated floods. Currently, after the water receded, with the specific assistance of cadres, a large number of livestock were transferred to families of soldiers and the elderly, weak, and widowed, and mutual assistance was organized for the general public. Once, a thousand cattle were organized to launch a surprise planting campaign. The production enthusiasm of the masses is extremely high. During the surprise campaign, groups of three to five people could be seen everywhere in the fields, some pulling plows, some pulling drills, some digging, and some pouring. Jiang Fodang and Jiang Er and others did not even go home at noon, tensely racing to plant.

    【本报冀南二日电】具体解决耕牛劳力困难，恩县水灾区十五万亩抢种完毕。三区卜官屯等十六个村因地势低洼，连遭水灾，目前水落后，在干部具体帮助下，对抗属及老弱孤寡大量调剂了牲口，对一般群众组织了互助，曾组织千犋牲口，突击耩种，群众生产情绪极为高涨，突击期间，满地三五成群的人群，拉犁的拉犁，拉耧的拉耧，掘的掘，倒的倒，蒋佛当蒋二等每到正午还不回家，紧张抢种。
