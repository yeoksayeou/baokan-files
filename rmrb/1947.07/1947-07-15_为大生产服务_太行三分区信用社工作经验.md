    Serving Large-Scale Production
    Experience of Credit Cooperatives in the Third District of Taihang
    With the concerted efforts of the government, county-level federations of cooperatives, and banks in the Third District of Taihang, the activities of credit cooperatives have developed rapidly in the past six months. Thirty-five cooperatives have been established that also operate credit departments or cooperatives, ten independently operated credit cooperatives and silver shops, and the 45 credit cooperatives have a total capital of 22,792,060 yuan, with an average of more than 500,000 yuan of fixed capital per cooperative. The business nature and organizational form can be divided into three types according to the specific conditions of each region:

    I. Setting up a credit department within a cooperative, allocating a portion of funds as the credit department's capital, and then absorbing some idle funds from the masses to become part of the cooperative's overall funds, while independently managing credit business, independently operating in accordance with its own regulations, and jointly calculating dividends with the cooperative at the time of settlement. This method requires that the cooperative's business direction is to develop production and serve the masses, so that credit activities can resolve the contradictions and concerns of serving cooperative members and serving the masses.

    II. Independently raising shares and operating independently to establish credit cooperatives. This organizational method is more laborious and is suitable for market towns or joint organizations based on natural economic zones. Generally, market towns have industry and commerce, and it is easier to organize idle funds and absorb deposits. Therefore, the masses have strong demands in terms of organization, and development is smooth. For example, the Huangshan Credit Cooperative. Natural economic zones can connect the economic relations of a certain area based on their production conditions and habits. For example, the Baichi District of Huguan, with the iron industry as the center, organizes the wages of workers in five or six villages in the district, gathers capital through deposits, and organizes workers to combine credit cooperative investment with operation. Or, through investigating the national economy and calculating social wealth, organize for reproduction and expansion of production.

    III. The organization of idle funds represented by Guihua mobilizes 70% for fixed deposits, combines bank loans for independent operation, and independent development, which is a transitional form for the trial establishment of credit cooperatives. This form has no entanglement of dividend calculation, and can vigorously organize mass production, organize idle funds, absorb deposits, and expand fixed deposit quotas. In the process of development, after the masses benefit, they will realize the importance of credit cooperatives in production, and will voluntarily invest in credit cooperatives from small to large, from individual to collective. The key lies in business guidance, which must accurately calculate the actual production of the masses, vigorously support it, expand the development area, and identify the nature of the business with emphasis, in order to obtain the support of the masses and continue to develop.

    The credit activities in the past six months have obtained the following preliminary experiences:

    I. The organizational principle should be "everyone raises shares, everyone manages, and everyone uses." That is, mobilize the masses to organize shares and resolve the contradiction between share dividends and production income. At the beginning, the masses believed that credit cooperatives had many benefits and were very much needed, but commercial investment had large profits, while credit cooperative shares had small profits. Although production loans have high interest, they felt that "investing in shares is a loss and taking out loans is an advantage" because they may not need loans themselves. Therefore, shareholding must be mass-based, and management must also be jointly managed to avoid unfairness in the order, amount, and duration of loans. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the nature of production, distinguish between urgency and importance, and be selfless, and be able to grant loans at discretion for all production.

    II. In developing business to support production, it must be based on its own economic environment and created by the masses, which cannot be fully covered by a business brochure. In the past six months, the creations of the masses have been extremely rich:

    1. In terms of organizing deposits and loans, the patterns are constantly innovating and intricate. Many cooperatives have completely organized their standby capital and scattered idle funds, striving for 50% to 60% as fixed deposits, and investing them in production. Beishe in Pingshun and Huocun in Changzhi created a method of storing grain, absorbing 1,850 jin of stored grain, with a monthly interest of 4 jin per 100 jin. 1,500 jin were lent out at a monthly interest of 6 jin. Some credit cooperatives organize idle labor to develop savings deposits. The Baichi Credit Cooperative organized more than 20 elementary school students in the village to pick up scrap iron in nearby iron factories after class and save the money they sold in the credit cooperative, so that the students' study and use can be completely self-sufficient.

    2. Regarding investment and operation, small-scale industrial production can be organized in areas with special products. For example, Baichi, Huguan, organized several ironworkers based on the village's iron industry production, combined with credit cooperative investment, to carry out production. The leadership must make it clear that the purpose of investment is to regulate rural finance and support production, and not simply shift to profit. Credit operation and production interests should be consistent and fully developed.

    3. On the issue of interest, it cannot be given a certain range and scale, allowing the masses to democratically study and practically try and create. According to the actual production conditions, borrowing habits, and seasonal business nature in various places, different regulations are formulated and mastered to change. The masses have their own principles and will not be too high or too low to lose big because of small. In order to encourage long-term deposits, the Huangshan Credit Cooperative created a monthly progressive interest calculation method, increasing the interest rate by 5 li each month. Because the masses in Beishe had a demand for grain loans, they stipulated a method of 4 points for deposit interest and 6 points for loan interest to turn over grain.

    4. Work ticket cashing and deposit, the credit cooperative and the production team stipulate the relationship and procedures for exchanges. Generally, no discounting is used to prevent it from flowing into the market, and it is deposited at the face value.

    III. The relationship between banks and cooperatives. At present, credit cooperatives are still in the initial stage. Due to unfamiliar business and long loan periods to support production, it is easy to make capital turnover ineffective. Therefore, banks and general cooperatives should promptly understand the situation and give guidance and vigorously support it in many ways:

    1. Capital support: Thirty-nine of the forty-five credit cooperatives have received financial assistance from banks, but banks should not provide too much financial assistance to avoid hindering self-reliance and affecting the foundation for long-term development. Regular business relations should be established in business. Banks should help credit cooperatives turn over funds. If credit cooperatives absorb too many deposits, they can be deposited in the sub-branch. When the credit cooperative's inventory is unable to pay, it can be overdrawn to the sub-branch.

    2. Organize bank loans through credit cooperatives, which belongs to the nature of entrusted business. On the one hand, it promotes the business development of credit cooperatives, and on the other hand, it fosters the establishment of prestige. As far as banks are concerned, credit cooperatives understand the production situation of the masses, and the distribution is accurate and convenient, with lending and borrowing combined, making turnover flexible. However, it must basically maintain the essence of government low-interest loans and cannot be issued at high interest rates. Credit cooperatives generally only allow banks to reduce interest by 5 li as remuneration and do not charge additional interest.

    3. In terms of business, banks and cooperatives should often understand the situation of credit cooperatives, help research, hold meetings to study work and exchange experience, help recognize shortcomings and correct errors, and should not order or force.

    IV. In terms of leadership, the method of providing experience for typical demonstration and extensive research should be adopted, and experience and regulations cannot be copied. Credit cooperatives are still in the initial stage, and the business scope and operating methods do not yet have mature experience. They should create a variety of methods based on the specific conditions of various places and according to the experience of the masses, and provide research. For example, the experience of the Huguan Huangshan Credit Cooperative and the Licheng Beiliu Credit Cooperative has greatly promoted the development of credit cooperatives in the county.

    The current basic policy is to "accelerate promotion, universal development," establish a rural financial network and consolidate the rural financial front. Combine the organizational work of the large-scale production movement, organize funds to accelerate turnover, solve the difficulties of insufficient funds in the large-scale production movement, and give full play to the organizational role.

    为大生产服务
    太行三分区信用社工作经验
    太行三分区的信用合作社活动，在政府各县联社银行一致配合努力推动下，半年来开展迅速，已建立起卅五个合作社兼营信用部或社，十个单独经营的信用合作社和银号，四十五个信用社共有资金二二、七九二、○六○元，平均每社有五十多万元固定资本。营业性质和组织形式依各地具体情况可分三种：
    一、在合作社内开设信用部，抽拨一部资金为信用部的资金，再吸收一部分群众游资，成为合作社整个资金的一部分而单独经营信用业务，依据自己章则独立活动，在结帐时和合作社合资计红。这种方式，必须合作社的业务方向是发展生产为群众服务，这样信用活动就可以解除为社员服务和为群众服务利益所得的矛盾和顾虑。
    二、单独集股独立经营，成立信用合作社。这种组织方式较为吃力，宜用于集镇或以自然经济区联合组成。一般集镇有工商业，组织游资吸收存款比较容易。因之在组织上群众要求也强，发展顺利。如黄山信用合作社，自然经济区可以他的生产条件和习惯，构通一定地区的经济关系。如壶关百尺小区，以铁业为中心，组织该小区五六个村的工人工资，经过存款汇集资本，将工人组织起来，信用社投资结合经营。或者从调查国民经济，计算社会财力，组织进行再生产和扩大生产。
    三、以下桂花为代表的组织游资，动员百分之七十为定存，结合银行贷款独立经营，单独发展，是信用社试创建立的一种过渡形式。这种形式没有股红计算的纠缠，可以大力组织群众生产，组织游资，吸收存款，扩大定存期额。在发展过程中，群众获益后，就会认识到信用社在生产中的重要性，会自愿的由少而多，由个体到集体向信用社投资，关键在于业务指导上，必须精确的计算群众的生产实况，大力扶持，发展面要广，鉴别营业性质而有重点，方能取得群众拥护继续发展。
    半年来的信用活动已获取如下几点初步经验：
    一、在组织原则上应是“大家集股，大家经营，大家使用”。也就是动员群众组织股金，解除股金红利与生产所得的矛盾。一开始群众认为信用社好处很多，十分需要，可是商业投资利润大，信用社入股利润小。虽然生产贷款的利大，但自己入股不一定需要贷款，感到“入股吃亏贷款沾光”。所以集股必须是群众性的，经营上也必须合伙管理，免得贷款先后，金额大小，期限长短的不公平，因而必须照生产性质，分别缓急，大公无私，凡是生产都要能酌情贷放。
    二、在开展业务扶持生产上，须按照自己经济环境，依靠群众创造，决非一个营业简章所能完全包括，半年中群众的创作是极其丰富的：
    １、在组织存放款方面，花样翻新错综复杂。有许多社将待用资本和分散游资完全组织起来，争取百分之五十到六十为定存，而投入生产。在平顺北社长治霍村创造存粮办法，吸收存粮一八五○斤，每百斤月息四斤。贷出一五○○斤，月息六斤。有些信用社则组织闲余劳力，发展储蓄存款。百尺信用社组织该村小学生二十余人，课毕到附近铁厂拾漏铁，卖了钱储存在信用社里，小学生的学用便可完全自给。
    ２、关于投资经营，在有特产地区可组织小型工业生产。如壶关百尺根据该村的铁业生产，组织铁工数人，结合信用社投资，进行生产。在领导上须明确投资目的在于调剂农村金融扶持生产，不能单纯以利润为转移。信用经营与生产利益应求得一致而充分发展。
    ３、利息问题上，不能给以一定的范围和尺度，让群众民主研究实际试创。按照各地生产实况、借贷习惯与季节经营性质等，分别规定掌握变化。群众自有一定原则不致过高过低以小失大。黄山信用社为了鼓励长期存款，创造按月累进计息办法，逐月加息五厘。北社由于群众有贷粮要求，即规定存息四分贷息六分的办法，以周转粮食。
    ４、工票折现存入，信用社与生产组队订定来往关系及手续。一般不用贴现，不使流入市场，按票面数目折现存入。
    三、与银行合作社关系，目前信用社尚在初创阶段，由于业务生疏，扶持生产贷期较长，易使资金周转不灵，所以银行和一般合作社应及时了解情况给以指导，并多方面大力扶植：
    １、资金支援：在四十五个信用社内有三十九个得到银行帮助资金，但银行帮助资金不应过多，以免妨碍自力更生，影响长期发展基础的奠定。在业务上应建立经常来往关系，银行应帮助信用社周转资金，信用社吸收存款过多，可存入支行。信用社库存无力支付时，可向支行透支。
    ２、通过信用社组织银行贷款，属于委托业务性质，一面推动信用社的业务发展，一面扶植建立威信。就银行讲，信用社了解群众生产情况，发放准确便利，随收随放，收贷结合周转灵便。但基本上须保持政府低利贷款的本质，不能高利发放。信用社一般也只由银行让息五厘作为酬劳不另取利。
    ３、在业务方面银行合作社对信用社要经常了解情况，帮助研究，召开会议研究工作交流经验，帮助认识缺点改正错误而不能命令强制。
    四、在领导方面，要采用典型示范提供经验广泛研究的办法，不能搬经验套章则。信用社尚在初创阶段，业务范围经营办法都还没有成熟的经验，应当依据各地具体情况，根据群众经验，创造多种多样的办法，提供研究。如壶关黄山信用社黎城北流信用社的经验，都大大推动了该县信用社的发展。
    目前的基本方针是“加速推动，普遍发展”，建立农村金融网巩固农村金融阵地。结合大生产运动的组织工作，组织资金加速周转，解除大生产运动中资金不足的困难，高度发挥组织作用。（李进军、张国祥）
