[Reported from Jincheng by this newspaper] Kong Fuhai from Beidui Village, Second District, recalled the famine years, unified his family's thinking, influenced his neighbors, and then promoted the entire village's savings and preparation for famine. After reading the call for drought prevention and savings in the newspaper in early June, he thought of the disastrous situation of thirty-two years ago: children starved to death! Daughters sold to Jicheng! He himself pretending to be from Taiyuan! ... He felt that it was imperative to save and prepare for famine. On June 6th, before dark, he called the whole family together to discuss solutions, but his brother's wife and his own youngest daughter were afraid of eating bran. The next day, Kong Fuhai himself first took a *dou* of fine bran and two *dou* of corn, personally grinding it into bran, setting an example by eating bran first for breakfast and dinner. Only then did he slowly explain to his family: first talking about the hardships of thirty-two years ago, his mother's heart was moved first, and the thinking of the whole family of ten gradually became unified. He also said, "Even with thousands of *jin* at home, half should be bran and vegetables!" Now, the whole family has been saving for six days, already saving one *dou* and eight *he* of millet. His brother's wife and his own youngest daughter are also actively collecting wild vegetables every day. In addition to eating it themselves, they have stored eleven *jin* of dried wild vegetables. Then he publicized his family's savings situation to his neighbors, to his mutual aid group, and then to Jinjiazhuang, a neighboring village. He publicized it during everyone's meeting, and said to everyone: "Save one *jin* of rice a day, and don't ask the neighbors for help in famine years!" At the same time, he led his entire mutual aid group to start saving like his family, and further helped the farmers' association organize more than 20 women, including Li Caiping, to collectively gather wild vegetables. Now, a wave of saving and preparing for famine has been set off in the entire Beidui Village. At the district commendation meeting this time (June 16th), he was publicly elected by everyone as a district-level model for saving and overcoming famine, and the Second District Production Committee also specially issued a notice on June 19th to the entire district to commend him.

　　说服全家首先吃糠
  　影响四邻推及全村
  　孔福孩当选全区渡荒模范
    【本报晋城讯】二区北堆村孔福孩回忆灾荒年景，打通全家思想，影响邻家，进而推动了全村节约备荒。六月初，他看了报上防旱节约的号召后，就想起三十二年的灾难情景：小孩饿死了呀！闺女卖到冀城呀！自已装作太谷呀！………就感到非节约备荒不行。六月六号那天，不等天黑，就把全家人叫到一块商量办法，可是兄弟媳妇和自己的小女儿怕吃糠。第二天孔福孩自己先拿了一斗细糠，二斗玉茭，亲自碾成糠，以身作则，早晚两顿饭先吃起糠来，这时才又给家人慢慢解释：先谈三十二年的苦处，他母亲的心首先感动了，全家十口人的思想才逐渐的打通了。他还说：“家有千万，糠菜一半！”现在全家节约开始了六天，已省到小米一斗零八合，兄弟媳妇和自己的小闺女也天天在积极的采野菜。除自家吃外，已存了晒干的野菜十斤十一两。于是他又把他家里节约情形向邻家宣传，向互助组内宣传，再到邻村靳家庄。乘大家开会时宣传，并向大家说：“一天省米一斤，荒年不去求邻家！”同时他又带领他的互助组全体象他家一样搞起节约来，并进一步去帮助农会组织了妇女李彩平等二十余人集体拔野菜。现在北堆全村已掀起了节约备荒的浪潮，在这次（六月十六号）区的评功大会上，被大家公选为全区的节约渡荒模范，二区生产委员会也特于六月十九号通报全区表扬他。
