　　【Our Newspaper, Jiluyu, 25th】In the newly recovered areas of Qühe (a newly designated county, located south of Changyuan and east of Yangwu), Yuanwu, Yangwu, and other places, a vigorous land reform is underway. After the recovery of this area, the local Party committee dispatched a large number of cadres to work there. Currently, there are already forty villages in Qühe County that have begun to distribute the fruits [of the land]. Yuanwu and Yangwu are also starting to implement this. Initially, the masses asked us: "Do you have the authority to make decisions?" "Will you leave again?" We made our position clear, saying: "We are determined to make decisions and will never leave." So, the masses began to move things from the landlords' homes. At first, the masses hesitated, but after we detained the landlords, the masses rushed in, taking all the grain and movable property. Initially, whoever took it owned it, but soon the masses felt that this was unreasonable and demanded a fair distribution themselves. After moving everything, the masses spontaneously established their own organizations. Some elected representatives, while others simply called themselves farmers' associations, dividing into squads and groups. Women also elected representatives and established subgroups. Representatives replaced the Bao chiefs, and squad leaders replaced the Jia chiefs, immediately demolishing the Baojia system. The masses rose up everywhere, their enthusiasm extremely high. In the ××ji area of Qühe County, special agents fired guns at night to create disturbances, but the masses stood guard, patrolled in shifts, and continued to distribute things. Currently, each county and district is holding a peasant congress, and a large-scale land reform movement is being universally launched.

　　摧垮保甲建立农会曲河农民蜂起分田
    【本报冀鲁豫二十五日电】新收复区曲河（新划县，位于长垣以南，阳武以东）原武、阳武等地，热烈展开土地改革。该地收复后，地委特派遣大批干部前往工作，现曲河县开始分果实的村庄，已有四十个。原武、阳武也在开始进行中，起初群众向我们说：“你们作主不作主？”“你们还走不走呢？”我们表明态度说：“坚决作主，始终坚持不走了。”于是群众便到地主家搬东西，开始群众还犹豫，后来我们把地主扣起来，群众就一拥而进，不管粮食浮财一律搬，起初是谁拿是谁的，但很快群众即感到不合理，自己要求合理分配。搬完之后，群众就自动的建立起自己的组织，有的选举代表，有的就叫农会，划分了班和组，妇女也选出了代表，建立了小组，代表代替了保长，班长代替了甲长，把保甲制一下摧垮了，群众到处蜂涌而起，情绪十分高涨，曲河县××集一带特务夜间打枪扰乱，但群众站岗放哨，轮流巡逻，仍继续分东西。现在各县区召开农民大会，大规模的土地改革运动普遍展开。
