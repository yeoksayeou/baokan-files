Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. According to Associated Press and United Press reports from Shanghai: The President of the Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce, Jardine Matheson boss Keswick, in his annual report issued on the 2nd, pointed out that the economic crisis in the Jiang-controlled area is becoming increasingly serious. Keswick stated: Shanghai's economic situation is continuously deteriorating and will get worse. He said: China's domestic inflation and the imbalance of foreign prices make Chinese exports practically impossible. Another major obstacle to exports is the forced sale of foreign exchange obtained from abroad by exporters to the Central Bank at unrealistic official prices. Keswick warned that Japan may regain its export of manufactured goods to the Chinese consumer market. Regarding China's import trade, Keswick stated: Old established companies have withered, normal imports are subject to controls, radios are prohibited from being imported, while expensive cars and other luxury goods are imported in a continuous stream by well-known merchants through illegal means. Although China (referring to the Jiang family government) allowed non-monopoly companies a year ago, government (referring to the Jiang government) monopoly enterprises such as the Central Trust Bureau, China Silk, China Textile, and China Petroleum, etc., still operate the largest businesses. And mismanagement, such as the defects of the fire brigade and theft, etc., continue to maintain Shanghai's unenviable reputation. Keswick also stated: It is a great pity that this great country still lacks the political and economic conditions that are extremely important for private investment and the resumption of production.

　　上海英商会会长分析
  　蒋区经济不断恶化
    官僚资本逞凶民营企业凋残
    【新华社陕北五日电】据合众及美联社沪讯：上海英商会会长怡和洋行老板开思威，在二日发表的年度报告中，指出蒋管区经济危机正日趋严重。开氏称：上海的经济情况正在不断恶化，而且还要坏下去。他说：中国国内的通货膨胀和国外物价的不平衡，使中国输出实际上成为不可能。出口的另一主要障碍，为强迫出口商按不合实际的官价向中央银行出售其自外国所获得之外汇。开氏警告称：日本可能重新攫取对中国消费市场输出其制造品。在论及中国的进口贸易时，开氏称：旧日成立的公司业已凋残，正常的进口受着管制，无线电机被禁止输入，而昂贵的汽车及共他奢侈品，则由著名的商人以非法的手段源源输进。中国（指蒋家政府）虽于一年前允许不保持独占公司，但政府（指蒋政府）独占事业如中央信托局、中国蚕丝、中国纺织、中国石油等独占公司，仍经营着最大的商业。而管理的窳败，如消防队的缺陷与盗等等，使上海继续保持不值得羡慕的声誉。开氏又称：殊可惋惜的是这一大国尚无对私人投资与恢复生产至为重要的政治经济条件。
