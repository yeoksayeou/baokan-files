　　Zhao Baozhen Joins the Party at the Front Line

　　I. Twice a Prisoner of War
　　When Zhao Baozhen was eighteen years old, he joined the Kuomintang's 15th Army because of his difficult life. Soon, he deserted because he could not bear the oppression and suffering, but was caught again after only ten days.
　　Once, when the Chiang army attacked the New Fourth Army, he was captured. Seeing the close unity of the New Fourth Army officers and soldiers, he decided to serve with them forever. Unexpectedly, during a march, he fell ill and lagged behind on a cart and was captured by the Chiang army's Security 2nd Regiment.
　　This year when the Eighth Route Army went south and returned, they passed through Weishi. The Security 2nd Regiment was guarding the Yellow River. Zhao Baozhen, led by the deputy squad leader, was sent to stand guard outside the village. He saw the Eighth Route Army passing by the village and discussed joining the Eighth Route Army with the deputy squad leader. The deputy squad leader said he was a bad element and shot him. In the darkness, he missed, and Zhao Baozhen returned fire. Then he took a rifle and four grenades and ran to our Ming character unit.

　　II. Risking His Life to Reconnoiter
　　In this battle, the Seventh Company conducted close combat operations in the open field. Zhao Baozhen's group was at the forefront of the fortifications, about 200 meters from the enemy. Before the fortifications were completed, Zhao Baozhen volunteered to scout the terrain of the enemy's position. In the middle of the night, he took two new soldiers to approach the enemy. He was in the front, and the two new soldiers were on the left and right, forming a triangular formation. They agreed on signals, using clods of earth to communicate. Throwing one meant stop, throwing two meant advance, and throwing three meant prepare to capture the enemy sentry. They approached the enemy's bunker and listened quietly to the enemy's movements. After a while, the enemy changed the guard. One said, "You have to be careful. The Eighth Route Army has dug trenches very close to us. Be prepared for the Eighth Route Army to attack suddenly. If they get in, not only will you be finished, but the lives of our entire company will be in danger."
　　He wanted to continue eavesdropping on the enemy's password, but waited a long time without hearing it. After a while, they were discovered by the enemy, who immediately opened fire. He calmly lay prone on the dead ground on the enemy side of the anti-personnel obstacle, and told the two new soldiers, "Don't move." When the enemy stopped firing, he carefully examined the terrain near the outer ditch, and also learned that there was a company of enemy troops behind the parade ground.

　　III. Repeated Bloody Battles Repulse the Enemy
　　The next morning, the enemy bombarded the Seventh Company's position with artillery fire, firing nine smoke bombs. Based on his past experience, he reported to the platoon leader, "The enemy is firing smoke bombs, they must be attacking us." His group waited for the enemy in the foremost fortifications. The shells caused dust to fly, and the smoke obscured the sky. One shell landed and broke a corner of the bunker, and the dirt pinned his leg. He forcefully pulled his leg out, and his ears, eyes, mouth, and nose were filled with dirt. Just as he was rubbing his eyes, an enemy soldier charged with a bayonet, jumping into Zhao Baozhen's fortification. He stabbed the soldier, who fell backwards.
　　Just as he pulled out his bayonet, another enemy jumped down from his right rear, grabbing Zhao Baozhen's leg. As the two wrestled, another enemy jumped down from directly behind him, grabbing his upper body. The two enemies tried to pin him down. In a moment of inspiration, he remembered the bayonet on his gun. He quickly gripped the hilt of the knife with his right hand, removed the bayonet, and stabbed the enemy grabbing his upper body in the shoulder. The enemy fell down. The enemy grabbing his leg stood up and grabbed Zhao Baozhen's gun. He stabbed him again, inserting the bayonet into the enemy's stomach, pulled out the knife, and stabbed the enemy in the neck. He had killed three enemies.
　　But at this time, his bunker was surrounded by more than 20 enemies. He collected eleven yellow-handled grenades from the corpses of the three enemies, bundled them together, and threw them at the enemies outside the bunker who were firing at our army. Three enemies were immediately killed, and four were injured. A Japanese-style machine gun was also destroyed. An enemy platoon leader said, "Get out of here! The Eighth Route Army's artillery is coming."
　　The enemy fled. After retreating about a hundred meters, the enemy company commander supervised the platoon to attack again. The soldiers did not dare to go up until the enemy commander fired his machine gun at them, only then did more than ten enemies charge up. Zhao Baozhen loaded the three rifles dropped by the enemy with bullets. When the enemy charged to the closest distance, he suddenly jumped out of the fortification, threw four grenades at the enemies, and quickly returned to the fortification, grabbed his gun and fired. Several of the enemies in the front were wounded, and the rest retreated in a panic.

　　IV. Avenging the Company Commander Inspires Fighting Spirit
　　When the artillery fire subsided slightly, our follow-up troops moved forward along the communication trenches. The Seventh Company Commander Yao Huawen also came up. He said to the soldiers, "Quick, bring Baozhen's body back!" Zhao Baozhen thought to himself, "Don't worry, I'm not dead. I killed seven enemies and got a machine gun and three rifles!"
　　After the company commander went up, he went to take the company commander's gun. The company commander saw that he was covered in blood and thought he was crazy, and said, "You are wounded and bleeding so much. Hurry to the rear trench and ask the medic to change your dressing." Zhao Baozhen explained the situation of his fight with the enemy, and then went to grab the gun to chase the enemy. The company commander said, "A soldier who disobeys orders! You go down and rest!"
　　At this time, the battalion headquarters thought that the Seventh Company had suffered too many casualties and sent the Eighth Company to take over the Seventh Company's defense. Just as the Seventh Company was moving to the rear, the enemy concentrated artillery fire to fire on the Seventh Company. Company Commander Yao Huawen died heroically. Yang Wenlao and Shi Erliu, two new soldiers, cried when they saw the company commander's sacrifice. Comrade Zhao Baozhen said to them, "Don't cry. We have to avenge the sacrificed company commander to be worthy of our beloved comrade. Let's not rest, let's join the Eighth Company in defending the position at the front line and avenge the company commander!" The two new soldiers agreed. Zhao Baozhen also said, "No matter how dangerous it is, I will always be in front of you. If I am not brave in killing the enemy, you can shoot me." Yang Wenlao and Shi Erliu said, "If we don't listen to your command, you can stab us to death with your bayonet." The three of them took the initiative to join the Eighth Company to complete the battle of defending the position. Until dark, the earthwork task in the rear was completed. Comrade Zhao Baozhen, under the enemy's fierce artillery fire, fought as one against a hundred to repel several enemy assaults. The cadres and soldiers all admired his bravery and resourcefulness. He was immediately formally admitted to the Communist Party in the trenches, and won the glorious title of "Hero of Killing the Enemy".

　　赵保珍火线入党
  　一、两次当俘虏
    赵保珍十八岁时，因为生活所迫，参加了国民党十五军，不久他因受不了压迫和痛苦开了小差，十几天又抓回来。
    某次，蒋军进攻新四军时，他被俘了，看到新四军的官兵亲密团结，就决心永远干下去，想不到一次行军中，他竟因病坐大车掉队，又被蒋军保二团俘去。
    今年二月八路军南下返回时，经过尉氏，保二团在黄河附近担任警戒。赵保珍由副班长领着到村外放哨。他看到八路军由村边经过，就和副班长商议到八路军去副班长说他是坏分子，打了他一枪，黑夜中没有打着他，赵保珍也向副班长还了一枪，就带了一支大盖枪，四个手榴弹跑到我明字部队来了。
    二、冒死侦察
    这次战斗中，七连在战场以辽阔地中进行近迫作战，赵保珍的一个组，在距敌二百公尺左右的工事最前线，工事还未完成前，赵保珍自报奋勇的去敌人阵地侦察地形，半夜里，他带了两个新战士向敌接近，他在前面，两个新战士分在左右，成为三角队形，规定好记号，用土块联络，投一下是表示停止，投两下是前进，投三下是准备捉敌人的哨兵。他们接近到敌人碉堡下边，静听敌人的动静，不一会儿，敌人换哨了。一个说：“你们要小心，八路军挖沟已经离我们很近了，防备八路军突然进攻，他们进来了，不但你们完蛋，连咱们全连生命都不能保。”
    他想再继续窃听敌人的口令，但等了好久，未有听到。过了一会却被敌人发觉了，敌人即用猛烈的火力扫射过来，他沉着的伏在鹿砦上边地平面的死角里，并告诉两个新战士说：“不要动”。待敌人停止扫射了，他即沿外沟附近详细的把地形看了一遍，也了解了较场后敌人是一个连的兵力。
    三、反复血战打退敌人
    第二天早上，敌人用炮火轰击七连阵地，打了九发烟幕弹，他根据过去的经验，向排长报告说：“敌人打烟幕弹一定是向我们攻击”。他那个小组就在最前面的工事中静待着敌人，炮弹打的尘土飞扬，烟幕蔽天，一发炮弹落下，将地堡打破了一个角，土把他的腿压住了。他用力将腿拔出来，耳、目、口、鼻都硼满了尘土，他正在揉眼之际，一个敌人端着刺刀冲来，往赵保珍的工事里就跳，被他一刺刀刺了个翻身倒下去了。
    他刚把刺刀拔出来，右后方又跳下个敌人，抱拄赵保珍的腿，两人正在扭打，从他正后边又跳下个敌人，抱住他的上身，两个敌人想按倒他，他急中生智，想起枪上的刺刀，随即用右手反握刀柄，取下刺刀，顺势向那个抱上身的敌人肩膀上刺去，敌即倒下，那抱腿的敌人，立起就抓赵保珍的枪，他又一刺刀，插进了敌人肚皮，拔出刀来，再向他的颈脖刺了一刀，三个敌人被他刺死了。
    但这时他的地堡已被二十多个敌人包围了，他从那三个敌人尸身上搜集了十一个黄把手榴弹，捆在一起，向依靠堡外射击我军的敌人投去，当即炸死了三个，伤了四个，一挺日式机枪也被炸坏了，敌人一个排长说：“快离开这个地方，八路军的炮打来了。”
    敌人逃窜了。退后约百十米，敌连长督着那个排再上，当兵的都不敢上，只等敌指挥官向他们打了机枪才冲上来十多个敌人。赵保珍把敌人掉下的三支步枪装上子弹，等敌人冲到最近的距离时，他突然跳出工事，向敌人打了四颗炸弹，又迅速的回到工事中，摸起枪来就打，最前面的敌人被他打伤了好几个，其余的狼狈的退回去了。
    四、为连长复仇激发斗志
    炮火稍停，我们的后续部队沿交通壕向前运动，七连长姚华文也上来了，他对战士们说：“快去将保珍的尸首弄回来！”赵保珍心里想：“放心吧，我没有死，还搞死了七个敌人，得了一挺机枪和三支步枪哩！”
    连长上去后，他去夺连长的枪，连长看到他满身满脸都是血，认为他疯了，便说：“你身上负了伤，流了这样多血，赶快到后边沟内叫卫生员给你换药去。”赵保珍说明了他和敌人战斗的情形后，又去夺枪要追敌人去。连长说：“军人不服从命令，你快下去休息吧！”
    这时营部以为七连伤亡过重，派八连接七连的防。七连正向后边运动之际，敌人又集中炮火向七连射击，连长姚华文同志牺牲了，杨文劳、石二柳两个新战士看到连长牺牲了哭起来，赵保珍同志就向他们说：“不要哭，咱们要与牺牲的连长报仇才对得起敬爱的同志，咱们不去休息，参加八连到最前沿坚守阵地，给连长报仇！”两个新战士也同意了。赵保珍又说：“不管如何危险，我总在你们的前头，我若不勇敢杀敌，你们就把我打死。”杨文劳、石二柳说：“我们若不听你的指挥，你就用刺刀将我们刺死”。三个人就主动的参加了八连完成坚守任务的战斗，直到天黑，后边的土工作业任务完成了。赵保珍同志仍在敌人猛烈炮火之下，一当百的打退了敌人几次冲锋。干部战士无不佩服他的勇敢和机智，当即在战壕内正式加入了共产党，并且获得了“杀敌英雄”的光荣称号。
