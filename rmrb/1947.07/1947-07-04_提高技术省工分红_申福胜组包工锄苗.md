　　Improve Technology, Save Labor, Share Dividends
  　Shen Fusheng Group Contracts for Weeding and Thinning
    [This dispatch] From our newspaper: The Shen Fusheng group in Shannandi, first district of Pingshun, consisting of fourteen households, with ten full laborers and two half laborers, has greatly improved its technology after group members Wang Anguang, Shen Liuze, and others proposed technical contracting. This type of technical contracting, also known as small contracting, is a planned temporary contracting that focuses on improving technology. The method is as follows: On June 17th, in Shimu (place name), the seedlings were sparse and uneven, some tall and some short, and some seedlings were dead. Under these conditions, after consulting the landowner and discussing within the group, technical standards were set. Seedlings were still planted three times per step, but to prevent death, five or six plants were temporarily left at each planting, spaced two to three finger-widths apart. It was determined that each mu of seven-tenths of land would be contracted out for four and two-tenths work points. To achieve the set standards, inspections and technical work point deductions were implemented. After weeding for a while, a preliminary inspection was conducted, and a final inspection was carried out after weeding was completed. Shen Kaize did not properly thin out the seedlings and was deducted two-tenths of a work point. Guo Zhangshuan did not reach with his hoe, deducting one-tenth of a work point, actually doing three and three-tenths work points. A total of nine-tenths of a work point was saved, and then dividends were shared according to work points. Everyone felt that this was reasonable. In five days, the entire group contracted out 21.3 mu of land. The original contract was for 41.6 work points, but only 36 work points were actually done, saving 5.6 work points. After group research, within these 21.3 mu of land, 13.54 mu met first-class standards, and the rest was second-class, with no third-class land. During the first inspection of the entire village, this group achieved the most first-class land, quickly and well, and was rated as a model group for weeding techniques.

    [This dispatch] From our Taiyue [Correspondent] on the 2nd: The Jide detachment of the Lianhe Mutual Aid Brigade in Shangguan, Yangcheng, has developed rapidly in the past six months, completely overcoming the phenomenon of administrative command grouping that existed in the past three years, and truly achieving voluntary association. Of the 1,617 people in the entire village, excluding 455 children under the age of eight, 1,162 people, 100% of the men have been organized, and 66% of the women have been organized. Labor efficiency has also improved unprecedentedly, with an average of more than one work point saved for every two work points performed. Li Dequn, chairman of the Farmers' Association, used an average of 20 work points per mu last year, but this year only eight work points per mu are required. Last year, the entire village spent a month weeding and thinning, but this year it was completed in just 13 days, and it was generally done more meticulously than last year. The land was generally plowed two to three times, and 60 loads of fertilizer were applied per mu. With three thorough rains, the millet has now grown to over three feet high, and the corn seedlings are also two to three feet high. The cotton has grown thirteen leaves. According to Li Taiyin, an old farmer over seventy years old, this is the best crop he has seen in twenty-six years. Due to the widespread organization and improved labor efficiency, even though 66 full laborers were sent to support the front lines in the Jinan campaign, there were still surplus work points for sideline production. In half a year, the total income from sideline production of the entire detachment reached 7,392,350 yuan, an average income of 4,530 yuan per person.

　　提高技术省工分红
  　申福胜组包工锄苗
    【本报讯】平顺一区山南底申福胜组全组十四户，男全劳力十个，半劳力二个，由组员王安广、申六则等提出技术包工之后，在技术上有很大提高。这种技术包工也叫小包工，是有计划的临时包工，着重技术上提高。办法是：如六月十七日在十亩（地名），大苗子稀稠不匀，有高有低，有些死苗，就在这种条件下，一面征求地主家意见，一面经小组讨论订出技术标准，有苗的还是一步三按，但怕死一按暂留五六棵，每棵相距二指至三指，一亩七分地确定以四个二分工包出。为了实现所定标准，进行检查与技术折工，锄一歇即初步检查一次，锄完时进行了总检查，申开则没有把苗间择清楚，扣了二分工，郭张拴锄头没走到，扣了一分工，实做了三个三分工，共省工九分，再按工分红。这样都感到合理，全组在五天内共包了二十一亩三分地，原包四十一个六分工，实做三十六个工，省工五个六分。在这二十一亩三分地内，经小组研究，一等标准田十三亩五分四厘，下余是二等地没有三等地，全村进行第一次检查时，这组一等地多做到又快又好，评为锄地技术模范组。（平顺防荒锄苗小报）
    【本报太岳二日电】阳城上官中有联合互助大队吉德分队，半年来飞跃发展，完全克服了过去三年的行政命令编组现象，真正达到自愿结合；全村共一千六百一十七人，除四百五十五个八岁以下儿童外，其余一千一百六十二人中男人已经百分之百的组织起来，妇女百分之六十六组织起来，劳动效率亦空前提高，平均两工即可省一工多。农会主席李德群去年种地平均每亩用工二十个，而今年每亩只用八个工，去年全村锄苗遍苗整工一月还未锄完，今年仅用十三天即锄完了，而且普遍作得较去年细致，一般地都犁两遍至三遍，每亩上粪六十担，又遇三场透雨，现谷已长至三尺余高，玉菱苗亦有二三尺高，棉花已长出十三个叶，据七十余岁的老农李泰银谈，是二十六年以来未有过的好田禾。由于组织的普遍，劳动效率提高，晋南战役中，虽有六十六个全劳力支援前线去了，仍有余工进行副业生产。半年中全分队副业生产收入即达七百三十九万二千三百五十元，平均每人收入四千五百三十元。
