(Our newspaper, Shexian) The Shexian First District's merit and commendation movement to present gifts to the Party in celebration of July 1st, after over a month of efforts, has completely changed the face of the entire district, with all aspects of work making great strides. The relationship between the Party and the masses has become even closer, and the awareness of Party members and the masses has also increased. A report on the main achievements is presented below:

First, backward villages have become advanced, and backward Party members have become active. Nan Village and Huili Village are particularly typical. Nan Village is a large village with nearly a thousand households, and its work has been backward for several years. Some comrades in the branch engaged in factionalism and disunity. During this commendation campaign, they were moved when they saw other villages working enthusiastically. Many Party members were moved to tears, feeling ashamed that they could not contribute to the people and present gifts to the Party. At that time, they all made resolutions to progress. The political director, who previously never went to the fields, took the lead in going to the fields to labor. Village cadres proactively sought out district cadres for consultation on any matter. During the work summary, they said: "Consulting with the masses, there is a solution to everything. In the past, individuals surpassed everything, thinking only they could do it all, and nothing could be done well." In Huili Village, through the branch's commendation efforts, and after resolutely struggling against Party members with landlord thinking, combined with mass commendation to examine cadres, work progressed smoothly. Xue Temple and Xiangtangpu, two villages, rose from fourth-class villages to second-class villages; Hou Kuanzhang rose from second-class to first-class. There have also been significant changes among Party members. Li ×× of the Shentou branch used to be a nominal Party member who ate ready-made meals. After this commendation, he went deep into his own street and developed a mutual aid group from six households to forty-two households. He played a leading role in the whole village, rising from a sixth-class merit to a special-class merit, and was selected as a model gift-giver for the entire district. The political director of Xue Temple previously did not struggle against landlords out of sentimentality. After this commendation, he immediately mobilized the peasants to struggle against the landlords. In the end, the masses elected him as a leading model and rewarded him with fruits, which he resolutely refused.

Secondly, the ideological style of district and village cadres has also greatly changed with the development of the movement. Liu Jingyi, the secretary of the Shentou branch, has been passive in leading production for several years. Others called him a "movement cadre," who led the work day and night during movements, but rested when it came to production. After this commendation, he consciously drew up a production plan to lead production and present gifts to the Party. After returning to the village, he transformed the backward streets in the entire village into advanced streets in twenty-five days. In frugality and famine preparedness, his team first carried out accurate calculations for each household, which promoted the whole village. During the summary, he was selected as a special-class model gift-giver for the entire district. Yang Shicheng, the vice chairman of the Yangjiashan Farmers' Association, always acted like a veteran and was not humble. After the commendation, he first examined his own subjective and awkward style and made great progress within a month. No matter what he encountered, he thought about it first before expressing his opinion, and did not get angry with other cadres, humbly learning from Shen Rui. The style of district cadres has also improved similarly. Before the commendation, Comrade Feng You'ao was not at ease with his work and wanted to go home often. Afterwards, he quickly changed and took the initiative to delve into his work. Comrade Yang Yuerong, who previously did not delve into her work and did not use her brain, also delved into her work this time. In Shentou, she personally went to Feng Ergou's house to help calculate the household's assets and how to get by. She also used her brain to consider each task before doing it.

Thirdly, the degree of awareness of Party members and the masses has been unprecedentedly improved, and the relationship between the Party and the masses has become even closer. In particular, after the Party was made public, the masses recognized the Party even more and united around the Party. The Yangjiashan and Huili branches, from the historical summaries in the commendation movement, waged a resolute ideological struggle against alien elements within the Party and purged six bad elements, maintaining the purity of the Party and consolidating Party unity. A total of twenty-one landlord cadres were removed throughout the district. The masses recognized that landlords were Chiang Kai-sheks in miniature and must be purged, establishing a leadership group based on the poor and hired peasants. At the same time, sixty-nine outstanding elements from the poor and hired peasants joined the Party throughout the district, strengthening the Party's strength. After the masses summarized and struggled with history, they further realized that without the leadership of the Party, there would be no good times today. When the masses of Sihe Township evaluated merits, they first gave Chairman Mao a special merit, and then they evaluated their own merits, saying, "Without Chairman Mao, there would be no us." After the Party was made public in front of the masses through the commemoration of July 1st, the masses saw the Party with their own eyes. Therefore, the demands to join the Party and the enthusiasm to learn from the Party are very high. A member of the masses in Sihe Township said: "That year, I saw Shen Hongliang, Shen Ziting, and others holding meetings in the fields. I took a look and left. If I had known that they were Communists, I would have sat with them no matter what, and asked them to accept me. Now I regret it so much." An old man in Shentou in his sixties said: "Now we can see the Communist Party, and we must learn from them."

Finally, the development of the merit and commendation movement has greatly promoted drought prevention, famine preparedness, production, and frugality work. This is the biggest gain. After summarizing their history, the village branches accepted the spirit of struggle and famine relief experience of the past eight years, and were determined to do this work to the best of their ability. Party member Wang ×× in Shi Village took the lead in collecting 300 catties of vegetables, influencing the whole village. Comrade Shen Rui helped the masses calculate their household assets day and night, actively thinking of various ways to save. Yang Yaoguang went to explore good places first before leading the masses to collect vegetables, and then returned to mobilize the masses to go and gather. ×××, a member of the Shentou branch committee, mobilized three households to save rice consumption by weighing it. According to the achievements from July 1st to July 8th alone, a total of over 118,000 catties of vegetables were gathered (16 villages), over 195,000 catties of rice were saved (18 villages), over 2.8 million yuan was saved on tobacco and alcohol (16 villages), over 3.9 million yuan was earned from sideline occupations (16 villages), over 2.8 million yuan was earned from weaving straw hats (19 villages), over 8,000 mu of seed grain land was entrusted (20 villages), over 1,000 mu of corn were planted by carrying water (16 villages), and 101 water cellars were dug (12 villages).

In summary, after the historical summary and merit commendation movement in the first district, work has greatly developed. In the future, this movement will be implemented throughout the year. (Xing Chongzhi)

    涉县一区经过立功表模
    干群振奋工作猛进
    学会用脑筋落后变成了先进
    【本报涉县讯】涉县一区迎接七一给党送礼的立功表模运动，经过月余的努力，使全区面貌完全改观各样工作大进一步，党与群众的关系更加密切了，党员群众的觉悟也随之提高，现将主要收获报导于后：
    首先是落后村变成了先进，落后党员变得积极了，特别是南庄、会里最为典型。南庄是一个将近千户的大村子，几年来工作落后，支部有些同志闹宗派不团结。这次在表模中，看到其他村都搞得热火朝天，他们都受了感动，有许多党员感动的哭了，感到不能为民立功，给党送礼，觉得惭愧。当时都下了进步的决心，政治主任从前永不去地，自己首先下地劳动，村干部有了啥事主动的去找区干部研究。这次经过干种地，干部深入了各街各组，在总结工作时他们说：“深入群众商议，啥也有办法。过去是个人超过一切，天下唯有自己能行，啥也干不好”。会里村在表模中，经过支部立功，和有地主思想的党员作了坚决的斗争，结合群众立功审查了干部，工作顺利开展。雪寺、响堂铺二村，由四等村上升到二等村；后宽嶂由二等到一等。党员方面也有很大变化，神头支部李××以前是个吃现成饭的挂名党员，这次立功后，自己深入自己街，搞了一个由六户发展到四十二户的互助组。在全村起了带头作用，由六等功升到特等功，被选为全区的献礼模范。雪寺政治主任过去因情面不斗地主，这次立功后，回去马上发动农民给地主作斗争，最后群众选他是领导模范，并用果实奖励他，他坚决拒绝了。
    其次是区村干部的思想作风，随着运动发展也大有改变。神头支书刘景义，几年来对领导生产消极，别人称他是“运动干部”，在运动时白天黑夜不休息领着干；一到生产时，就是他的休息期。这次立功后，自觉的订出领导生产计划，给党献礼，回村后二十五天当中，把全村落后街搞成先进街了。在节约备荒中，他组各家首先进行了精确计算，推动了全村，总结时被选为全区献礼的特等模范。杨家山农会副主任杨士成，自己一贯摆老资格不虚心，经立功后，首先自学检讨了自己的主观蹩扭作风，在一月内大有进步，不管遇到啥事，先思想一下，才发表自己意见，对其他干部不起火，虚心的向申瑞学习。区干部的作风也同样的进步了，冯有鳌同志立功前工作不安心，肯回家，以后很快的转变，自己是主动的往工作里钻。杨越荣同志，以前工作不深入不费脑筋，这次也深入了工作，在神头亲自到冯二狗家帮助计算家当过时光，每件工作也用脑子考虑再做。
    再次是党员群众的觉悟程度空前的提高，党和群众的关系更加密切，特别是党员公开后，群众更是认识了党，团结在党的周围。杨家山、会里支部，从表模总结历史中，和党内的异己分子作了坚决的思想斗争，并清洗掉六个坏分子，保持了党的纯洁，巩固了党内团结。全区共撤换了二十一个地主干部，群众认识了地主是小蒋介石，必须清洗，建立了以贫雇为主的领导集团。与此同时，全区有六十九个贫雇农民优秀分子入了党，壮大了党的力量。经过群众总结斗争历史，更是认清了没有党的领导，就没有现在的好时光。四合乡群众评功时首先给毛主席立了一个特功，然后他们才评功，都说：“没有毛主席就没有咱们”。经过纪念七一，党在群众面前公开后，群众亲眼看到了党。因而入党要求、向党学习劲头很大。四合乡一个群众说：“我那一年见人家申洪亮、申子亭等在地里开会，我看了一下走了，我要知道他二人是共产党，我非给他们坐一块，叫他收下我不行，现在想起来真是后悔死人了”。神头一位六十多岁的老汉说：“这可看见共产党了，咱要向人家学习”。
    最后经过表模运动的开展，大大的推动了防旱备荒生产节约工作，这是最大的一个收获。各村支部总结了历史后，接受了八年来的斗争精神和渡荒经验，都下了最大的决心做这一工作。石党员王××一人首先采菜三百斤，影响了全村。申瑞同志不分白天黑夜，帮助群众计算家当，积极的想各种办法节约。杨耀光为带领群众采菜，自己首先去探好地方再回来动员群众去打。神头支委×××，一人动员了三户节约吃米用秤支。仅据七一到七八这几天的成绩来看，共打菜十一万八千余斤（十六个村），节省米十九万五千余斤（十八个村），省烟酒钱二百八十余万元（十六个村），副业赚洋三百九十余万元（十六个村），编草帽赚钱二百八十余万元（十九个村），寄种谷地八千余亩（二十个村），担水栽玉茭一千余亩（十六个村），掏水窖一百零一个（十二个村）。
    总之，一区各村经过总结历史立功表模运动，工作是大大的开展了，今后还要将这个运动贯彻到全年工作中。（邢崇智）
