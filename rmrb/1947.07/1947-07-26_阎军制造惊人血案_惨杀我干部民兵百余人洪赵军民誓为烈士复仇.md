Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 20th. The Yan Army committed a shocking massacre of 114 people, including masses and democratic government cadres. On the 3rd of last month, when the Yan Army fled from Hongdong towards Linfen, they forcibly took away 114 democratic government cadres, militia, and masses arrested in various places, and killed them along the way. On the 7th, they killed seven people in Gaohe Village; on the 9th, they killed eleven people in Qucun; on the 10th, they collectively massacred twenty-six people in Tushui Fort; and on the 11th, late at night, they stabbed the remaining seventy people to death on the riverbank in Xilu Village, throwing all the bodies into the river. The masses of the village were awakened by the heroic shouts of the victims before their deaths. The next morning, many places on the sand and stones of the riverbank still had the bright red bloodstains that the bandits had not had time to cover up. The masterminds of this case were the Yan-appointed Hongdong County Chief and the heads of the Kuomintang and the Three People's Principles Youth League in the county. The army and people of Hong Zhao are extremely indignant at this heinous crime of the Yan bandits and vow to arrest the perpetrators and bring them to justice to avenge the martyred heroes.
