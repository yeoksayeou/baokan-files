　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 5th. The sons and daughters of the Siyang and Shuyang counties in Northern Jiangsu’s Huaihai District have won successive victories in the battle to protect grain. According to statistics from the first five days of June alone, they eliminated over 730 enemies, including the battalion commander of the 155th Regiment of the 28th Division, Yu Xiushan. They recovered six Jiang-puppet strongholds, destroyed 20 Jiang-affiliated township regimes, and shattered the conspiracy of Xia Dingwen, the Jiang-appointed Commissioner of the Eighth Administrative District of Jiangsu, to seize wheat.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 7th. Shen Chengxing, the puppet township head of Shen Dazhuang in Xiping Township, Shuyang, Northern Jiangsu, ordered the "confiscation" of 250 mu of wheat fields belonging to our military, workers, and martyrs’ families during the summer harvest. Upon hearing this, the militia immediately advanced to the vicinity of the Jiang-puppet township office and warned him that he must harvest all the wheat of the military, workers, and martyrs’ families and deliver it, otherwise he would be severely punished. The Jiang-puppets were extremely panicked and dared not disobey, so they had to hurry to harvest. Even the puppet Bao chiefs, who never worked, had to sharpen their knives and go to the field to cut wheat, delivering all the grain to the liberated areas. The militiamen said with laughter: "The country was won through fighting. In front of the enemy, we must use the power of the people."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 3rd. After the Central Jiangsu People's Guerrilla Team captured the important riverside town of Lingdian (between Haimen and Qidong) at the end of May, slogans "Celebrating the Great Victory of Lingdian" appeared in many streets and alleys in Shanghai where people from Northern Jiangsu lived. They discussed one after another, "The Communist army is about to counterattack!" The Jiang-puppet Haimen County government, fearing the counterattack of the People's Liberation Army, has moved to the Three Factories on the riverside, preparing to escape down the river to Qinglong Port. The "Returning Home Legions" are also transporting their families and property to Shanghai one after another. Zhang Shanxing, the head of the Jiang-puppet Qidong Self-Defense Regiment, and over a thousand others were recently sent to Shanghai to purchase firearms. However, fearing the power and prestige of the People's Liberation Army, they have diverted the funds for purchasing firearms to use as escape funds.

　　东海泗沭子弟兵五天歼敌七百余
    【新华社华中五日电】苏北淮海区子弟兵在保粮战斗中迭获胜利，仅据东海泗（阳）沭（阳）两县六月头五天统计，即歼敌二十八师一五五团营长余秀山以下七百三十余名，收复蒋伪据点六处，摧毁蒋记乡政权二十处，粉碎了蒋记江苏第八行政区专员夏逆鼎文部署的抢麦阴谋。
    【新华社华中七日电】苏北沭阳西屏乡沈大庄伪乡长沈成兴，在夏收中乱命“没收”我军、工、烈属二百五十亩麦田，民兵闻讯，当即挺进至蒋记乡公所附近，警告其须把军、工、烈属全部麦子割好送来，否则将予以严厉惩罚。蒋伪恐慌异常，不敢违抗，只得赶紧收割，连向不劳动的伪保长也只得磨刀上场割麦，将全部粮食送到解放区。民兵们欢笑地说：“江山是打下来的，在敌人面前，就要使用人民的威力。”
    【新华社华中三日电】苏中人民游队于五月底攻克江边重镇灵甸（在海门启东间）后，上海许多有苏北人民居住之街巷，曾出现“庆祝灵甸大捷”标语，他们纷纷议论“中共军快反攻了”。蒋记海门县政府惧怕人民解放军反攻，已迁至江边三厂，预作走清龙港下江逃逸之准备。“还乡团”亦纷将家属财物运沪。蒋记启东自卫团长张山行等千余人近被派赴沪购办枪械，因慑于人民解放军之声威，已将购枪费移作逃亡费。
