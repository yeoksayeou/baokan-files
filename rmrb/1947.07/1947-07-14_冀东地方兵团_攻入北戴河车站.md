    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 10th (Delayed Dispatch): On the evening of the 1st, a unit of the Jidong Local Corps captured Beidaihe Station on the Beining Railway in one fell swoop, annihilating most of the defending enemy. It is estimated that more than 50 were killed or wounded, 99 were captured, and two 60mm mortars, two machine guns, and 150 rifles were seized. Another unit launched a counterattack in the coastal area north of Hangu Station on the Beining Railway at the end of last month, recovering more than ten villages and towns, including Dashentang, Xiafujiazhuang, Jiupeng, and Shuangqiao. The Hangu salt flats of the famous Changlu Salt Field in North China have largely returned to the hands of the people.
