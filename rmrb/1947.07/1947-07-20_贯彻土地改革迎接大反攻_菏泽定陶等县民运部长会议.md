(From our newspaper in the Jilu豫 [冀鲁豫] area on the 18th) In order to implement the District Party Committee's land reform policy and prepare for the counter-offensive, the Fifth Sub-district Committee convened a joint meeting of civil affairs ministers from various counties to summarize the past five months of land reform. In Heze, cadres and the masses relied on tunnels to carry out their work, and land reform had been implemented in more than 30 villages. In Dingtao, after the second re-arrest, only liquidation and grievances were carried out, without extensive mobilization. Later, it was discovered that the broad masses urgently demanded land, so the administrative power was fully utilized, landlords and bad elements were severely suppressed and controlled, and a large-scale campaign was implemented. The county held meetings of activists and village head training courses, detained landlords, and, to address the shortage of cadres, each district organized several armed inspection teams to inspect villages regularly. Any landlord found to have violated the law was immediately punished, breaking open the situation. Moving floating wealth and distributing land became common in every village and estate, and landlords generally lowered their heads. However, the movement failed to be raised a step further in time, transforming it into a conscious movement of the masses, and remained at a purely administrative command level. As a result, although the masses gained some benefits, they were not mobilized ideologically and organizationally.

In Cao County, the initial focus was solely on distributing land without dealing with floating wealth. Later, at a county-wide cadre meeting, right-leaning thoughts were resolutely opposed, and a review movement was launched to counter the "nothing accomplished" mentality, and the masses became active. In the border four districts, cadres cooperated with small armed units, distributing land wherever they went. Fucheng broke the circle of peasant congresses unsuitable for the enemy's rear, and held peasant congresses in several districts with relatively stable environments, further deepening the land reform movement. The peasant congresses were also combined with model recognition, and many mass leaders emerged, laying the foundation for the masses' determination and courage, quickly transforming the movement into a conscious movement of the masses, with most farmers organized and the relationship between cadres and the masses unprecedentedly improved.

Qibin's land reform efforts had been unsuccessful several times due to environmental changes. At the end of April, due to the tense environment, it was changed to a village-by-village approach. In the third district, militiamen were incorporated into cadre groups, sticking to the border areas. They slept in tunnels at night and continued working when the enemy left. If it wasn't possible during the day, they worked at night. Later, as the environment became more severe, they adopted the approach of cadres working wherever they went. If the enemy was stationed in the east, the cadres would work in the west, and if the enemy was stationed in the central area, they would go to the border areas. During the sweeps, mass meetings of more than a thousand people were held ten miles away from the enemy, and the masses were still highly enthusiastic. The environment in Kaocheng was particularly tight, with the enemy conducting sweeps day and night in large and small groups. We actively suppressed bad elements with lean and capable armed work teams and conducted propaganda among the masses, stabilizing the morale of the masses and deterring landlords and bad elements from sabotage.

    贯彻土地改革迎接大反攻
    菏泽定陶等县民运部长会议
    【本报冀鲁豫十八日电】五分区地委会为贯彻区党委土改方针，迎接反攻，特召开各县民运部长联席会，总结过去五个月土地改革运动。菏泽干部群众依靠地道进行工作，三十余村已实行土改。定陶二次吊回来，单搞清算诉苦，没有大量发动。后来发现了广大群众迫切要求土地，就充分发挥了行政力量，严厉镇压和控制地主坏蛋、实行大干，以县为单位召开了积极分子会议、村长训练班，扣押地主，并适应干部不足情况，每区组织几个武装检查组，定时到各村检查，发现违法地主立即惩罚，轰开了局面。村村搬浮财，庄庄分土地，地主普遍低了头，但未能及时将运动提高一步，使其变为群众自觉的运动，而停留在单纯的行政命令上，因而虽然群众得到些利益，而没有在思想上和组织上发动起来。曹县开头单纯分土地，没搞浮财，后在全县干部大会上坚决反对了右倾思想，开展复查运动，反对“没搞头”思想，群众活跃起来。在边沿四区，干部配合小型武装，走到那里分到那里。复程打破了农民大会不适合敌后环境的圈子，在环境比较稳定的几个区召开了农民大会，使土地改革运动更加深入。农民大会又与表模相结合，涌现出不少群众领袖，奠定了群众的决心与勇气，使运动很快变成群众自觉的运动，大部分农民组织起来，干群关系空前改善。齐滨几次土地改革，都因环境变化没有搞成。四月底，因为环境紧张，改为一村村搞。在三区，民兵编入干部小组，挺到边沿区搞，夜间睡在地洞里，敌人走了，就继续搞，白天不行，黑夜搞。后来环境更加严重，就采取干部跑到那里作那里的办法。敌人住东边，干部跑到西边作，敌人住中心区就到边沿区去搞。在扫荡时，离敌人十余里的地方，开一千余人的群众大会，群众仍然情绪高涨。考城环境特别紧，敌人大股小股昼夜“扫荡”，我们即以精干的武工队积极镇压坏蛋，对群众进行宣传，群众情绪因而稳定，地主坏蛋便不敢破坏。
