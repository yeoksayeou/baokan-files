  　Striving to Join the Party at the Front Line, Competing to Kill the Enemy and Make Meritorious Achievements
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 5th] Frontline reporter Cheng Yu reports: In a certain unit of the Jin-Cha-Ji People's Liberation Army, a surge of battlefield merit-making and front-line Party membership application was sparked among non-Party cadres and soldiers during the Cang County battle. On the day before the battle, the Party branch of a certain company received more than a hundred letters applying for meritorious service and Party membership in half a day. Zhang Daxue, a new soldier of a certain machine gun company, fought bravely. During the battle, the Party group of the squad immediately held a meeting and approved his request to join the Party. Before the assault on the city, Zhang broke through the military bridge, bravely advanced under enemy fire carrying a heavy machine gun, and was the first to reach the designated position, build fortifications, and then, at the critical moment of crossing the military bridge, stirred up everyone's emotions and took the lead in seizing the West Gate. When the decision to admit him to the Party was announced, the morale of the whole squad was even higher. During the attack on the city, they eliminated all obstacles and quickly completed the task of scaling the city wall in coordination with other units. Duan Yutian, the deputy squad leader of the engineering squad of a certain company, when he received the task of blowing up the city gate, immediately handed over the fountain pen, diary, and four hundred thousand border currency he carried to the instructor and said, "If I sacrifice this time, I hope the Party will posthumously recognize me as a Communist Party member. This is my advance payment of Party dues." As a result, he completed the task and made great contributions, and the Party committee immediately approved his admission to the Party. The Party branches of many companies held branch meetings as soon as the battle ended to admit meritorious personnel to the Party, and many comrades who sacrificed were posthumously recognized as Communist Party members.

    【新华社晋察冀五日电】前线记者程于报导：晋察冀人民解放军某部，在沧县战斗中，非党干部与战士掀起战场立功、火线入党热潮。战斗前一日，某连支部于半日间即收到申请立功入党的信达百余封。某机枪连新战士张大雪作战英勇，战斗中班的党小组立即开会通过了他的入党要求。张于攻城前突破军桥，在敌火下肩负重机枪奋力前进，最先达到指定阵地，构筑工事，复在通过军桥紧急关头中，鼓动大家情绪，并首先抢占西关。当接收他入党的决走宣布后，全班士气更旺，攻城时排除了一切阻碍，配合他部迅速完成了登城任务。某连工兵副班长段玉田，在接得爆炸城门的任务时，当即将身带之水笔、日记本及边币四万元交给指导员说：“这次我如果牺牲，希望党追认我为共产党员。这些是我预交的党费。”结果他完成任务，并立了大功，党委会立即批准了他的入党。许多连的支部在战斗一结束就开支部会，接收有功人员的入党，许多牺牲了的同志被追认为共产党员。
