(This article is from Wen County) Under the new policy of boldly mobilizing poor peasants, uniting middle peasants, and resolutely eliminating landlords, the poor peasants and hired laborers of the Second District arrested 513 landlords and evil tyrants on the night of "July 1st." By the morning of the 2nd, slogans such as "Landlords are sinful, the poor are righteous," and "Middle and poor peasants and rich peasants unite to overthrow the landlords" were posted everywhere in the villages and towns. The poor peasants and hired laborers were all elated, discussing among themselves: "The landlords are locked up, it's time for us poor people to be emancipated!" On the 4th, more than 3,000 poor peasants from the entire district gathered in the district to undergo three days of intensive training. Initially, District Head Zhang, Branch Secretary Wei, and Section Chief Li from the Commissioner's Office expressed their attitude to the poor peasants, explaining that our policy is to thoroughly eliminate feudalism and resolutely overthrow the landlords. We will never be lenient with landlords and evil tyrants. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are standing up for us poor people. As long as everyone speaks out about their suffering, vents their anger, and thoroughly emancipates themselves, thoroughly beats down the landlords and evil tyrants, you can do whatever you want, and take whatever you want. We completely agree, support it, and cheer you on. After such mobilization, the movement of the poor peasants and hired laborers to accuse the landlords and evil tyrants was launched. In two days, more than 2,000 people rushed to accuse them, and more than 500 men, women, and children of all ages burst into tears. For example, when an old woman from Zhang Temple Village accused the landlord Ma Quanzhi of the village, she cried out loud, saying, "I... I offended the landlord Ma Quanzhi in the past because of land surveying, and he had my entire family of five shot dead within 20 days." Filled with grief and indignation, the old woman died on the spot, and all the people and cadres in the audience shed tears, saying in unison: "Such suffering, such injustice, we must help her get revenge, the landlords are truly living閻王!" When the poor laborers in West Liushi accused the landlord and local tyrant Zhang Fusheng, they tied Zhang Fusheng to the field and beat him severely, each person with a stick. The masses said, "Good! Good! This anger has been vented." On the last day, the masses automatically expressed their feelings and swore to each other. The chairman of the farmers' association in Shangyuan led the masses to burn incense and kowtow, vowing to overthrow the landlords when they returned. An old woman said: "If I don't do it, let an artillery shell fall on my head." A young woman said: "If I don't do it, let my whole family die." When the intensive training ended, the news of our army's recovery of Bo'ai and Qinyang came, and the masses' emotions were even higher. When the meeting was dismissed, everyone returned to their villages with high spirits. When they returned to the village, they tied up the landlords and evil tyrants detained in the district and brought them back to the village to prepare for struggle and disposal. Now, the flames of struggle and emancipation have been ignited in the villages.
