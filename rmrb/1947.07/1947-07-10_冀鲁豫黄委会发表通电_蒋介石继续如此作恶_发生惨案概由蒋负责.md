　　Hebei-Shandong-Henan Yellow River Committee Issues Circular
  　Chiang Kai-shek Continues Such Evil Deeds
  　Chiang Will Be Responsible for All Tragedies
    [Reported from Hebei-Shandong-Henan by our newspaper on the 8th] In late June, this reporter inspected the dike repair project in the Pu County section. Chiang's army constantly shelled and machine-gunned the farmers repairing the dike from across the river. I stayed on the levee in Liqiao Village for less than half an hour, and more than ten mortar shells were fired, and heavy machine guns continued to strafe. Airplanes were also circling in the air. Chiang's army treated these farmers who were repairing the dike to save themselves as if they were facing a formidable enemy. In Liqiao alone, more than ten dike repair workers were injured or killed. Zhang Gou's wife and her child, who was less than one week old, were also seriously injured. The mother's arm was broken, and the child's eyes were blown out. An old lady from Taqiao said to the reporter with infinite indignation: "Comrade, a few days ago, our female village chief, Xiulan, was killed by a shell while repairing the dike. Now only her child and her husband are left, and the child is crying from hunger!" She pointed to the Kuomintang flag on the south bank: "When will those cowards die!" Just as she was speaking, another shell hit. She crawled into the air raid shelter. This reporter witnessed that although this tall Yellow River levee was under enemy fire all day long, it was built by the farmers with their own flesh and blood. This shows the unparalleled great power of the people in the Liberated Areas!

　　冀鲁豫黄委会发表通电
  　蒋介石继续如此作恶
  　发生惨案概由蒋负责
    【本报冀鲁豫八日电】六月下旬，记者巡视仆县段修堤工程，隔河蒋军不断向修堤农民发炮，或用机枪扫射。我在李桥村的大堤上停留了不到半个钟头，就打来了十多发迫击炮弹，重机枪也不断的扫射，飞机还在空中盘旋，蒋军对这些修堤自救的农民，如临大敌，只在李桥的修堤工人就有十多个伤亡了。张狗之妻和不到一周岁的孩子，也负了重伤，母亲打断了胳臂，孩子眼睛被打出来了。他桥的一位大娘，无限愤慨的对记者说：“同志，前几天我们的女村长秀兰在修堤时被一颗炮弹打死了，现在只剩下了一个小孩和他男人，小孩饿的直哭！”他用手指着南岸的国民党旗：“那些孬种，啥时候死！”正说着一颗炮弹又打来了。她钻到防空沿里去。记者目睹这高大的黄堤，虽然终日都在敌人炮火下，毕竟被农民们用自己的血肉修筑成了。这显示着解放区人民无比的伟大力量！
