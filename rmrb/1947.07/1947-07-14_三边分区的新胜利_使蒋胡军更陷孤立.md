Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 12th. Frontline reporters commenting on the new victory of the Northwest People's Liberation Army in recovering the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Three-Border Region stated: "From May 30th to July 7th, in a short 38 days, the Northwest People's Liberation Army victoriously carried out the Longdong and Three-Border Campaigns, clearing out all enemies in a vast area of 350 *li* from south to north and 370 *li* from east to west, and recovering the county towns of Huachi, Quzi, Heshui, Huanxian, Dingbian, Anbian, and Yanchi. Despite the fortifications built day and night by the enemy over the past three months, and the American-supplied military equipment supplemented by Chiang Kai-shek, it was still of no avail. After the defeat of the Ma family armies of Ningxia and Qinghai, driven by Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan, the Jiang-Hu troops invading the border region are now in a more isolated position, and Hu Bandit Zongnan's so-called "joint attack" plan has gone bankrupt. Moreover, after defeating these accomplices of Hu Zongnan, the Northwest People's Liberation Army has won superior conditions for completely annihilating Hu Zongnan's bandit troops in the future."

    To this, the reporter recalled these two campaigns, stating: "The 38 days of war further prove that the enemy army is getting weaker and weaker, and our army is getting stronger and stronger. In the Heshui battle in early June, Ma Bufang's entire 82nd Division dared to resist stubbornly for a time, but after being severely attacked by us, it was defeated and retreated with injuries. More than ten days later, in the Huanxian battle, Ma Hongbin's entire 81st Division initially attempted to hold its ground, but as soon as they engaged, they abandoned all their light and heavy weapons and fled in disarray. Unfortunately, they ran too late, and were mostly annihilated in our army's pursuit. The lucky survivors numbered less than a thousand. Just over ten days later, when a part of our army counterattacked the Three-Border Region, most of the main force of Ma Hongkui's entire 18th Division had already slipped away in panic beforehand. The remaining parts, when our army approached, were defeated and fled the city with a slight blow."

    The reporter finally pointed out: "Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's purpose in wanting the Ma family armies to attack the border region was, among other things, to eliminate the miscellaneous troops. After the 82nd Division was transferred out, Hu Zongnan actively extended his secret service organizations and activities to Qinghai. If the Northwest miscellaneous troops do not wake up and continue to act as tigers for the Chiang bandits, they will inevitably meet their doom."

### 三边分区的新胜利  使蒋胡军更陷孤立

    三边分区的新胜利
    使蒋胡军更陷孤立
    新华社西北十二日电前线记者评西北人民解放军光复陕甘宁三边分区之新胜利称：“从五月三十日到七月七日短短的三十八天中，西北人民解放军胜利的进行陇东与三边两大战役，从南到北三百五十华里，从东到西三百七十华里的的广大地区内，肃清全部敌人，收复华池、曲子、合水、环县、定边、安边、盐池等县城。敌人虽有三个月来日夜赶筑的工事，及蒋介石补充的美式军火，却仍丝毫无济于事。受蒋介石胡宗南驱使之宁夏青海的马家军失败后，侵犯边区的蒋胡军已处于更孤立的地位，胡匪宗南的所谓“合击”计划，已告破产。而西北人民解放军在击溃胡宗南这批帮凶后，就赢得了今后全部消灭胡宗南匪军的优越条件。至此，记者回忆这两次战役称：三十八天的战争更证明敌军愈战愈弱，我军愈战愈强。六月初在合水战斗中，马步芳的整八十二师尚敢一度顽抗，遭我痛击后，始负创败退。十余天后在环县战斗中，马鸿宾的整八十一师开始尚图固守阵地，但一经交锋，即抛弃所有轻重武器狼狈逃窜，可惜跑得迟了，在我军追击下，仍大部就歼，侥幸残存者不及一千人，又过十来天，当我军一部反攻三边时，马鸿逵的整十八师大部主力事先就仓惶溜走，残留部分在我军逼近时，经轻之一击，却弃城溃逃。记者于最后指出：“蒋介石胡宗南要马家军”来进攻边区，其目的之一为消灭杂牌军，八十二师调出之后，胡宗南即积极向青海伸张其特务组织与特务活动。西北杂牌军如不觉悟。继续为蒋贼作虎伥，必遭毁灭的命运。”
