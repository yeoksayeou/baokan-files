Xinhua News Agency, Liaodong Front, 4th: The Liaonan Democratic Allied Army completely annihilated the Chiang bandit Independent 3rd Division under Wang Jing'an (missing two battalions) on the 30th of last month (June), and once again recovered Dashiqiao, an important railway junction on the southern section of the China Changchun Railway. After the Liaonan Democratic Allied Army captured Dashiqiao on the 16th of last month, the Chiang-Du troops gathered the reorganized 25th Division of the 52nd Army, the Independent 9th Division, and a portion of the Provisional 22nd Division of the 93rd Army transferred from Rehe to counterattack the area. In order to maneuver and annihilate the enemy, our army took the initiative to withdraw from the area on the 20th. On the 27th, the Chiang-Du troops transferred the Independent 3rd Division from Jinzhou to take over the defense. Our army launched another attack on the evening of the 29th. After fierce fighting until 10:00 AM on the 30th, Dashiqiao was liberated again. The defending enemy's Independent 3rd Division headquarters, its 7th and 8th Regiments, one battalion of the 9th Regiment, and a portion of the local puppet security forces were completely annihilated. At the same time, more than 3,500 enemy troops coming to the aid of Yingkou and Haicheng were repelled. According to preliminary statistics, a total of more than 1,800 enemy troops, from regimental and battalion commanders down, were captured, and more than 400 enemy troops, from regimental commander down, were killed or wounded. The captured war materials included 15 mortars, 6 six-zero mortars, more than 100 grenade launchers, more than 110 light and heavy machine guns, more than 1,500 long and short guns, 2,000 rounds of various artillery shells, 300,000 rounds of ammunition, 3 trains, more than 50 war horses, and one radio station. Note: The Independent 3rd Division was originally a "National Army Establishment Division" of the puppet Manchukuo, trained by the Japanese invaders, and was incorporated into the Chiang-Du army after "August 15th".

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 4th: The Chiang army's newly formed cavalry army invaded from the Faku-Kangping area on the 1st. A certain unit of the Democratic Allied Army launched a head-on counterattack at Santaizi, more than 30 li south of Kangping. From 1:00 PM, after two hours of battle, the enemy's right wing was routed, and more than 80 enemy soldiers were captured. The remaining enemy fled in panic, and our army pursued them to Wangye Tomb (40 li west of Faku). The results of this battle were: more than 80 enemies captured, more than 80 rifles seized, and more than 20 carts seized.
