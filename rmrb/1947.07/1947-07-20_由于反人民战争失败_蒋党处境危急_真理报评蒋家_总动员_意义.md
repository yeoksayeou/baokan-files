    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 17th: TASS, Moscow, reported that Pravda commented on Chiang Kai-shek's issuance of a "General Mobilization Order" on the 16th. According to the "International Review" column, the commentary stated: According to news from the United States, the Nationalist government, which six months ago had already mobilized millions of powerful troops equipped with sophisticated equipment, has now issued a so-called "General Mobilization Order." Sun Ke, Vice President of the Chinese government (referring to the Chiang family's small dynasty - note), explained this panicked decision by declaring: First, the victory of the People's Liberation Army "endangers the survival of the country" ("country" meaning the Chiang family's small dynasty - note); second, the significance of "general mobilization" is to "strengthen government institutions." Therefore, Sun Ke and other leaders of the Kuomintang are essentially admitting that their offensive against the People's Liberation Army has completely failed, and that their government institutions are disintegrating. Their announcement of general mobilization is to salvage the desperate situation at any cost, because it is clear that the American protectors of the Chinese reactionaries are increasingly losing confidence in the Nationalist government, and therefore are delaying granting new loans to this unreliable debtor. The mobilization order itself refutes the rumors that it is still possible to resume peace talks between the two warring parties in China. The intention of the mobilization order is only to please the American politicians who are determined to further expand the Chinese civil war. According to reports from Beiping, a statement by American military experts there pointed out that the mobilization order itself is the first public acknowledgement that the Chinese government itself is in a critical situation due to the failure of its war against the Chinese people. However, regardless of the swift and decisive calls, instructions, and threats against anyone who "obstructs general mobilization," the mobilization order will not gain sympathy or support among the suffering Chinese people. The declaration of the All-China Student Federation particularly proves this point. The declaration calls on the Chinese people to persist in opposing the civil war, opposing the Truman Doctrine, and opposing American aid. All progressive people and parties in China oppose general mobilization. The Chinese people do not want to fight against their compatriots.

    由于反人民战争失败
    蒋党处境危急  真理报评蒋家“总动员”意义
    【新华社陕北十七日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：十六日真理报对蒋介石发布“总动员令”，据“国际评论”栏发表评论称：据美国方面消息，在六个月前即已动员被精良装备了的数百万强大军队的国民党政府，现在又下所谓“总动员令”。中国政府（指蒋政府）副主席孙科在解释这一惊慌失措的决定时宣称：第一、人民解放军的胜利“危及国家的生存”（“国家”意指蒋家小王朝——备注）；第二、“总动员”的意义即“加强政府机构”。因此，孙科和国民党的其他领袖们等于是承认他们对人民解放军的进攻已完全失败，而其政府机构又是分崩离析。他们的宣布总动员是为了不惜任何代价以挽救危局，因为显然的，中国反动派的美国保护人日益丧失对国民党政府的信任，因此对这个不可靠的债务人迟迟不给新贷款。动员令本身就驳斥了那些说中国作战两党间还可能恢复和谈的谣言，动员令的用意只是讨好决意进一步扩大中国内战的美国政客们。据北平报载，该地美国军事家的发言指出：动员令本身是第一次公开承认中国政府自己由于反对中国人民的战争之败，已处于危急关头。但是不管以雷厉风行的号召、训令和以威胁对待一切“妨碍总动员”的人，动员令在苦难的中国人民中还是得不到同情与拥护。全国学联的宣言特别证明了这点，该宣言号召中国人民坚持反对内战，反对杜鲁门主义与美国的援助。中国一切进步的人士与政党，都反对总动员。中国人民不愿对自己的同胞作战。
