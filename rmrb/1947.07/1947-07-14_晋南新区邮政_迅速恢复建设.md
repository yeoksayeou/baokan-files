(Report from Taiyue, this newspaper, 11th) Since the Taiyue Postal Administration launched the "Serving the Army, Contributing to the People" emulation campaign in April, postal construction work has achieved significant development and improvement. Its significant achievements include: (1) Military Postal Construction: At the beginning of April, the bureau transferred cadres and postal workers to establish two military postal bureaus within the Jinan People's Liberation Army. Military postal stations were established in each brigade, working day and night to ensure that the field troops could connect with local postal bureaus wherever they went. This solved the problem of troops not being able to read newspapers during combat, and they could read them quickly, constantly receiving commendation from the troop leaders. (2) Implementing day and night express delivery, which has generally increased speed. The total length of main lines in the entire area is 2,499 li, with 465 li covered at night and 880 li by bicycle. For example, the journey from Yangcheng to Wenxi, which used to take five days, now takes three. Letters sent from Taihang to the Taiyue Third Sub-district, which used to take 13 to 15 days, now take only nine. Yangcheng to Pingyao, which used to take eight days, now takes only five, and to Tunliu, which used to take four days, now takes only two. Speed has increased by 40 to 50 percent. (3) Rapidly establishing and restoring postal construction in the newly liberated areas. Following the army's victories, connections were established with ten counties including Jishan, Hejin, Wanquan, Ronghe, Yishi, Linjin, Yongji, Jiexian, Ruicheng, and Yuxiang. Seven old post offices in Houma, Xinjiang, Quwo, Wenxi, Yongji, Yuxiang, and Yishi were taken over. Five county bureaus, five village stations, and three sub-bureaus were established, facilitating communication for the people in the vast Jinan area. Within a month and a half, a group of model cadres and postal worker heroes emerged. Miao Hongshen, the head of the military postal bureau, disregarded fatigue and worked day and night to contact local postal bureaus whenever the troops transferred, ensuring that newspapers were quickly delivered to the troops. Postal worker Wu Wenshun persisted in running the postal route for fourteen days under the harsh conditions of bandit activity and few pedestrians, completing the connection tasks for five counties including Jiexian, Yongji, and Linjin.
