Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 2nd. The ×× village of Liu Ji District, Shuyang County, on the banks of the Liutang River in northern Jiangsu, has resolutely fought against the "Homecoming Corps" for the past six months, guarding the river defense gate of the entire district. During the Shuyang and Subei defense battles last winter, the area was occupied by heavy enemy forces, and the entire village lost 33 head of cattle. After the main force of the Chiang army fled north, the militia in the neighboring village took the initiative to attack, and the village gradually became a guerrilla area. However, the masses were still afraid of the "Homecoming Corps" sneaking in at night and fled to other areas. After carrying out mass persuasion work, the cadres visited and comforted each household and wrote letters to persuade them to return. Labor hero Chen Xinhe persuaded 19 people to return home. More than 30 people returned in mid-January. At this time, the masses were still afraid and had no intention of production. On March 27, the "Homecoming Corps" crossed the river to rob. The militia supported the robbed households to demand compensation from the families of the "Homecoming Corps," greatly increasing the masses' confidence in the struggle. Everyone said: As long as the Eighth Route Army is here, there is reliance. During the spring plowing, there was a shortage of cattle, and they were even more afraid of the enemy taking the opportunity to steal cattle. The leadership, through mass deliberation, proposed that if the enemy kills a cow, they must compensate with two cows; if they kill a person, they must compensate with ten people. After a warning was issued by the families of the "Homecoming Corps," more than 80 cattle from neighboring villages were organized to plow more than 100 mu of spring fields in one day. At this point, the masses automatically formed a capable armed force and organized three night watch teams to guard the wheat fields all night. In mid-May, the enemy launched a second night attack, but suffered no losses due to strict precautions. Now the village's armed forces have doubled compared to before. As the new wheat is harvested, the masses are in high spirits and are buying ammunition to consolidate this "bridgehead fortress."

　　苏北沭阳某村群众自动组织武装抗蒋
    【新华社华中二日电】苏北六塘河畔沭阳县刘集区××村，半年来坚决与“还乡团”斗争，守卫全区河防大门。去冬沭阳、宿北保卫战时，该地为敌重兵盘踞，全村耕牛损失达三十三头。蒋军主力北窜后，邻乡民兵主动出击，该村渐转为游击区，但群众仍害怕“还乡团”夜摸，纷纷逃往别区居住。经开展群众性的说服工作，干部挨户访问抚慰、写信劝归，劳动英雄陈新和就说服了十九人回家。一月中回来三十余人。这时群众还害怕，无心生产，三月二十七日“还乡团”过河抢劫，民兵即支持被抢户向“还乡团”家属索回赔偿，群众斗争信心大大提高，都说：只要八路在，就有依靠，春耕时，缺乏耕牛，更害怕敌乘机抢牛。领导上通过群众酝酿，一面提出敌人打死一条牛，叫他赔两条，打死一个人，要他赔十人，经由“还乡团”家属提出警告，一面组织邻近各村八十余条牛，一天将一百余亩春田全部耕完。至此，群众自动组成精干武装，并组织三个打更队，整夜在麦田守望。五月中旬，敌二度夜袭，均因戒备严密，未受损失。现该村武装较前发展了一倍，新麦登场，群情高涨，纷购弹药，以巩固此一“桥头堡垒”。
