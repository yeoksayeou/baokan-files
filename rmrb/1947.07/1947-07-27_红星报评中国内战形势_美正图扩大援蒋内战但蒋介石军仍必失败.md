　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 25th. TASS Moscow Dispatch: Red Star Newspaper recently published a lengthy article by Leonidov, commenting on the Chinese Civil War, stating: "The civil war has not brought decisive results to the Kuomintang army on any battlefield. On the contrary, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has recently won successive victories, and the war is currently being conducted in the same provinces and regions where the Kuomintang launched the civil war twenty-one months ago. The victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is due to the fact that they are fighting for the true aspirations of the Chinese people. This army is growing stronger day by day due to the large influx of new patriotic fighters." How does the People's Army obtain its strength? A reporter for the New York Times wrote in response to this question: "The Communist army is composed of disciplined, capable, and enthusiastic young people. The appearance and morale of the Communist army are so impressive that foreigners are deeply moved." Leonidov stated: "The Kuomintang's civil war has brought extremely deep suffering to the people. The civil war has consumed all of the Kuomintang government's financial income, while the people are dying of hunger. In Shanghai, poor people are dying in the streets every day. The Kuomintang government is also implementing terror, imposing martial law in major cities, and arresting thousands of innocent people every day. The vast majority of Chinese people and progressive organizations resolutely oppose the expansion of the civil war. The situation in China, which is deeply mired in civil war, has aroused the well-founded horror of supporters of world peace and security. Chinese and foreign progressive organizations have pointed out in many statements regarding the US 'aid' to the Kuomintang: 'Every bullet sent to China by the United States will kill one more innocent Chinese person.'" However, the Kuomintang and its foreign parents from the American reactionary camp, regardless of the opposition of the Chinese people, are currently taking measures to further deepen and expand the Chinese civil war. Due to the dispatch of US General Wedemeyer to China, Kuomintang newspapers openly expressed the hope that the United States would further support the Kuomintang's civil war. But twenty-one months of civil war have proved that the Chinese warlords who launched the civil war will not be able to achieve victory. The Chinese people will resolutely fight for the establishment of an independent and democratic New China.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 21st. New York Dispatch: The Executive Committee of the "American Veterans Association," composed of veterans of World War II, recently unanimously passed a resolution at its Chicago meeting opposing the US government's unconditional financial and military support for the corrupt and reactionary Chiang Kai-shek government and the Greek government. The resolution severely criticized the US action of giving the Chiang government 130 million bullets, "because this action represents unlimited support for the Chiang Kai-shek government." The resolution also stated: "In view of the current US diplomatic activities, we are deeply aware of the danger that the United States may, as it did after World War I, abuse unregulated loans to rebuild German heavy industry, thereby allowing German military power to rise again."

### 红星报评中国内战形势　美正图扩大援蒋内战但蒋介石军仍必失败

　　红星报评中国内战形势
  　美正图扩大援蒋内战但蒋介石军仍必失败
    【新华社陕北廿五日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：红星报顷发表李昂尼多夫所作长篇论文，评述中国内战称：内战在任何一个战场上，都未曾给国民党军带来决定性结果；相反的，最近中国人民解放军接连获得胜利，战事刻正进行于二十一个月前国民党发动内战时的同一省份与同一地区。中国人民解放军的胜利，是由于他们是在为中国人民大众的真正愿望而奋战，这支军队正因为新的爱国战士的大批涌入而日益壮大。人民军从何获得其力量？纽约时报的记者在回答这个问题时写着：“中共军是由守纪律、能干与满腔热情的青年组成的，共军军容与士气之漂亮，使外国人士大受感动。”李昂尼多夫称：国民党进行内战，给人民带来了极深重的苦难，内战吞食了国民党政府的全部财政收入，人民则死于饥饿，上海每日均有贫民倒毙街头。国民党政府并实行恐怖，在各大城市戒严，每日逮捕成千无辜人民。中国广大人民和进步团体坚决反对扩大内战。深陷内战的中国局势且已引起世界和平与安全支持者有根据的惊骇。中外进步团体在许多声明中论及美国对国民党“援助”时指出：“美国给中国送来的每一颗子弹，都将多杀死一个无辜的中国人”。但国民党及其出自美国反动阵营的洋家长，不顾中国人民的反对，刻正采取措施，进一步加深及扩大中国内战。由于美国魏德迈将军之派华，国民党报纸公开表示希望美国更进一步支持国民党内战。但进行了二十一个月的内战，证明了发动内战的中国军阀将不能取得胜利。中国人民将坚决为建立独立民主的新中国而战斗。
    【新华社陕北二十一日电】纽约讯：由二次世界大战退伍军人组成的“美国退伍军人会”执委会，顷在其芝加哥会议中，一致通过一决议，反对美国政府无条件的在财政与军事上支持腐败和反动的蒋介石政府和希腊政府。该决议严厉抨击美国给予蒋政府一万三千万发子弹的行动，“因为这种行动是表示无限制的支持蒋介石政府。”决议又称：鉴于目前美国外交活动，我们深知有这样的危险，即美国可能象第一次世界大战后一样，滥用没有管制的贷款，重建德国重工业，而使德国军事力量重新抬头。
