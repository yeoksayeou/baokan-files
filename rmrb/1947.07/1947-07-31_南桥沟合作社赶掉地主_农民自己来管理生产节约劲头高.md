　　【Report from the People's Daily, Licheng】Liu Qingwen, a model cadre from the Second District's South Bridge Gully, adopted Li Jiakui's experience from Beiliu in squeezing out feudal elements. He and other cadres researched, inspected, and rectified the cooperative and the carpentry factory. They discovered that after the landlord Li Xianwen was overthrown by the masses last winter, he had infiltrated the carpentry factory as an accountant. After entering the factory, he lived very well, eating two portions of rice and one portion of noodles, and soup noodles for lunch. He also incited workers to demand more meat. Technician Yang Shutang, seeing this bad phenomenon, proposed on May 1st to reduce the lunch to one portion of noodles for three portions of rice...and other frugality measures. Li Xianwen refused, saying, "We can gain both fame and profit in the carpentry factory. If we want to be frugal, we might as well stay at home. Who comes to this grand factory to be frugal?" Thus, waste continued until July 1st. In two months, eight people wasted more than 160 catties of flour. In addition, he organized apprentice Liu Chou'er and others to resist the opinions of technicians, preparing to bring down the carpentry factory. The inspection also revealed that special agent landlords Zheng Yongqing, Yang Runfang, and Liu Jingwen held important positions in the cooperative. They did not lead the masses to survive the famine, did not prepare seeds for late-season crops, and used the cooperative's name to have mutual aid groups help them with plowing. The masses opposed the cooperative. For example, the liberated farmer Yang Naiyang said, "Whether we are liberated or not, they are still as powerful, and we are still the same as dead turtles." After discovering these problems, they immediately led the masses to draw a clear class line, removing the special agent landlords Zheng Yongqing, Li Xianwen, and the other five from the peasant ranks, and elected peasant cadres to take their place. The masses were overjoyed and said, "This is great!" After the peasant cadres took office, on the first day, they took the initiative to discuss with the village chief, political director, and militia committee director to organize the militia, women, and children to collect more than 400 catties of dried vegetables. They also planned to buy more bran and late-season seeds for planting, organized 21 carts to transport and buy grain for famine preparedness, organized women to be frugal to survive the famine, and men to water the seedlings.

　　南桥沟合作社赶掉地主
  　农民自己来管理生产节约劲头高
    【本报黎城讯】二区南桥沟模范干部刘庆文，接受了北流李甲魁挤封建经验，即和干部研究检查与整顿合作社和木工厂，发现地主李献文，去冬被群众斗倒后，混入木工厂当会计，入厂以后吃喝很好，两米一拉面，晌午代汤面，并发动工人要求多吃肉。技术工人杨书堂看到这种不良现象，在“五一”节便提出三米一杆面晌午减汤面……………等节约意见，李献文拒绝说：“咱在木工厂是名利两得，要节约倒不如在家啦，谁来这堂堂一个工厂节约来呢？”就这样一直浪费到“七一”。两个月八个人共浪费面一百六十余斤。此外并组织徒弟刘丑儿等抵抗技师意见，准备挑垮木工厂。检查中又发现特务地主郑永庆、杨润芳、刘敬文等在合作社任要职，不领导群众渡荒，不准备晚作物种籽，并打着合作社招牌叫互助组给他帮耕，群众反对合作社。如翻身农民杨乃洋说：“翻身不翻身人家还是一样威风，咱还是一样当死鳖。”当发现这些问题后，当即领导群众划清阶级界限，即把特务地主郑永庆、李献文等五人清出农民阵营，选了农民干部担任，群众高兴万分的说：“这就美啦！”农民干部上任以后，第一天就主动和村长、政治主任、武委会主任等干部研究组织民兵妇女儿童，采干菜四百余斤。还计划多买糠和晚种籽种，并组织大车二十一辆运输买粮食备荒，组织妇女节约渡荒，男人浇苗。（刘金温、王其平、郑远生）
