　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 25th: Pravda recently published an article by Pavlov entitled "Promoters of the Anti-National Sovereignty Movement." Pavlov stated: The United States, certain individuals in Western Europe, and bourgeois "thinkers" are promoting ideas against national independence, attempting to disarm European nations spiritually, and persuading countries to seek American "aid" by abandoning their sovereign independence. Marshall, in his recent speech to the U.S. governors, clearly believed that now is the time for European governments to learn from the experience of American governors. He hopes that countries will learn from the so-called "high individuality" of Utah and Texas in the United States; in other words, he is advising European countries to simply abandon national sovereignty as a condition for obtaining American loans. Although Bevin has tried his best to conceal the political nature of the "European Economic Recovery Conference," the Western European group will in fact attempt to establish itself under the guise of a "temporary European special organization." Pavlov stated, "No matter how the defenders of imperialism use various 'theories' to disguise their policy of conquering European countries and depriving them of their economic and political independence, their conspiracy will eventually be fully exposed and will inevitably meet with failure."

　　美国鼓吹反国家独立的观念企图在伪装下征服欧洲各国
  　这阴谋终将被揭破而遭到失败
    【新华社陕北二十五日电】莫斯科讯：真理报顷发表巴夫洛夫评“反国家主权运动的鼓吹者”一文。巴氏谓：美国与西欧某些人士及资产阶级的“思想家”们，正在那里鼓吹反国家独立的观念，企图在精神上解除欧洲各民族的武装，劝说各国用放弃其主权独立的方法求得美国的“援助”。马歇尔日前在对美国各州长的演说中，显然认为现在已是欧洲各国政府吸取美国州长经验的时候了，他希望各国学习美国犹他州与得克萨斯州的所谓“高度个性”；换句话说就是劝欧洲诸国干脆放弃国家主权以作为获得美国贷款的条件，贝文虽然竭力掩盖“欧洲经济复兴会议”的政治性，但事实上西欧集团将企图在“临时欧洲特别机构”的伪装下建立起来。巴氏称，“不管帝国主义的辩护者们怎样利用各种‘学理’来伪装他们征服欧洲诸国与剥夺他们的经济政治独立的政策，其阴谋终将被完全揭露，而且不可避免地会遭受到失败。”
