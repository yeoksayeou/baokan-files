Abstain from Tobacco and Alcohol, Weigh Rice for the Pot
[Our Newspaper Comprehensive Report] In order to share weal and woe with the masses, carry forward the spirit of overcoming the famine of 1942 and 1943, and work together to overcome the disaster and welcome the victory of the great counter-offensive, the agencies in various places have automatically lowered their living standards: The Jinnan Fifth Prefectural Committee and agency cadres have set out a savings plan: (1) Each person saves nine liang of millet per day (originally one jin twelve liang was issued per person per day, now one jin three liang is issued), and the rice is weighed and put into the pot. (2) No smoking cigarettes, no drinking alcohol, no going to restaurants. (3) Grind rice themselves. (4) Each cadre collects two jin of wild vegetables (dried). (5) The allowances and shoe and sock fees that each person should receive were previously sold and paid, but will now be changed to millet, which will be saved for famine relief. The Xiuwu County government saves two liang of millet and two liang of vegetable money per person per day, and does not buy vegetables, but grows bean sprouts by the kitchen itself. Eat less white flour and more corn and millet. Weigh the rice and put it in the pot every day and every meal, and prohibit throwing away leftover rice. Each department's office lamp oil is limited to five qian per lamp, and no lamps are lit at night when there is no work. Use waste paper as much as possible. Cadres stay at home and do not receive vegetable money and rice coupons from the agency. The Neiqiu County government has 35 cadres and miscellaneous personnel, each of whom saves four liang of millet per day, which can save 1,575 jin in half a year, enough for three people for one year. The Pindong County government's 30 cadres and miscellaneous personnel saved a total of 972 jin of allowance millet and 15 pairs of shoes. Each person saves three liang of millet per day. Previously, they ate a meal of white flour every five days, but now it has been changed to irregularly, and eat more coarse grains. No office paper will be issued for half a year, and waste paper will be used instead. (Xiufeng, Tingdong, Xianmou, Yishan, Wenfug)
