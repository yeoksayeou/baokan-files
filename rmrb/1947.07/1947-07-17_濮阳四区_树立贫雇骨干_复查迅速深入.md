    Puyang Fourth District
    Establish Poor and Hired Peasant Backbone
    Review Thoroughly and Rapidly
    [Our Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 14th] The Southeast group of Puyang Fourth District, at the end of the land reform, held a farmers' meeting to study the work situation. They unanimously agreed that the land reform was extremely incomplete, and some old village cadres were tired and dispirited. They thought it was "almost done" and were unwilling to take the lead in struggling against the landlords to thoroughly liberate the poor masses. The main reason was that middle peasants accounted for a large proportion of the cadres, and they did not have a deep experience of the suffering of the poor and hired peasants. After deliberation at the meeting, the leaders stated that they would listen to the opinions of the poor peasants and would definitely support the masses. The poor peasants proposed electing their own leadership organizations, selecting the best poor peasants in the village to participate in the leadership, and forming male and female poor peasant emancipation teams. Depending on the size of the village, each village would have three to nine people, and a captain would be elected. After the meeting, all districts solemnly elected peasant emancipation teams. After twenty days of work, each group made a preliminary summary, and the emancipation teams played the following four major guarantee roles in their work: (1) After the peasant emancipation teams participated in the leadership, the review movement became unprecedentedly active, and the land reform was thorough. In just three days, a large number of properties were found in six villages. (2) The distribution of fruits truly filled the poor pits, in line with the spirit of filling and making up the difference. The poor were given whatever they lacked, and they took whatever they needed. They were divided into groups of five according to the degree of poverty, and they were distributed as they struggled, reducing corruption and truly eliminating the landlords and filling the poor. (3) The political awareness of most peasants has been raised, and blank villages have been eliminated at the same time.
    [Our Newspaper, Ji-Lu-Yu, 15th] After Neihuang First District established the leadership of poor peasants and carried out a grand united struggle, it continued with village-by-village struggles. The review movement has developed in depth. After the district-wide poor peasant congress, the masses of nine villages in the Yongjian group together detained the landlords. The next day, a grand united struggle of more than 6,000 people, led by poor peasants, was carried out. More than 200 people bitterly complained and inspired each other's class consciousness. Dong Keqin said: The landlord Wang Tianzhi served as the captain of the enemy, forced me to offer guns, and subjected me to torture. Later, he took the guns away and said that whoever did not offer guns would be killed. The second younger brother of Geng Dongwen was killed by him. Everyone recalled the situation of Dongwen's death, and the peasants on the spot took up revenge sticks, crying and beating angrily, demanding that they hand over everything they had exploited from the poor. As a result, a lot of floating wealth was recovered. The next day, in the village-by-village struggle, Sha Village alone dug out more than forty dan of grain in one day. Because of the leadership of the poor peasants, the distribution of fruits can also be done to fill in the gaps and make up for the deficiencies, distributing whatever is lacking, and the masses are very satisfied.

    濮阳四区
    树立贫雇骨干
    复查迅速深入
    【本报冀鲁豫十四日电】濮阳四区东南组，在土地改革告一段落时，召开了农民大会，研究了工作情况，一致认为土地改革极不彻底，有部分老村干部表现疲塌消沉，他们认为已经“差不多”了，不愿进一步带头向地主斗争，使贫苦群众彻底翻身。主要原因是干部中中农成份数量多，他们对贫雇痛苦体验不深。经过大会酝酿，领导上表明听贫农的意见，一定给群众撑腰，贫农提出选举自己的领导组织，要村中最好的贫农来参加领导，成立男女贫农翻身队，根据村的大小，每村从三人至九人，并推出队长。会后各区隆重选举农民翻身队，经二十天的工作，各小组作了初步总结，翻身队在工作中起了如下的四大保证作用：（一）农民翻身队参加领导后，复查运动空前活跃，土改彻底，只三天内六个村即查出大批财物。（二）分配果实真正填平了穷坑，合乎填平补齐精神，穷人少啥给啥，用啥拿啥，按穷的程度划分五人一班，随斗随分，减除了贪污的现象，真正消灭了地主，填平了穷人。（三）大部分农民政治觉悟提高，同时消灭了空白村。
    【本报冀鲁豫十五日电】内黄一区树立贫农领导，大联合斗争之后，继以分村斗争，复查运动深入发展，全区贫农大会后，永建组九个村群众一起扣起地主，第二天以贫农为主进行了六千余群众的大联合斗争，二百多群众悲壮诉苦，互相启发了阶级觉悟之后，董克勤说：地主王天志当了敌人的大队长，强迫我献枪，施以毒刑，后来将枪拿去，并说谁不献枪就杀谁，耿东文的二弟就是被他杀的。大家回忆起东文死的情状，当场农民都拿着报仇棍，一面哭诉，一面怒打，让他们交出剥削穷人的一切东西，结果追出很多浮财。次日分村斗争，仅沙村一天即刨出粮食四十余石。因贫农领导关系，分果实也能作到填平补齐，缺啥分啥，群众都很满意。
