	Baishan's Freed Peasants
	Establish Armed Mutual Aid Groups

	(Our report) After the distribution of wheat and land, and the movement to oppose traitors and recover property, the masses in Baishan, First District of Bo'ai County, experienced a surge in their fighting spirit. The masses spontaneously bought guns and hand grenades, demanding to be armed. Their slogan was: "Protect ourselves, don't sleep outside the village." At the mass meeting on the 26th, thirty-one young people signed up to join the militia. Wang Jinwang said: "My son and I will both join the militia. We've been given land, who else will defend it if we don't? Only by arming ourselves can we sleep in peace and live in security." Following this, various villages spontaneously organized armed mutual aid groups. Everyone voluntarily joined together, some carrying rifles, some carrying hand grenades, some carrying spears and broadswords, each with a weapon. In case of a situation, they would cooperate with the militia to fight back. When there was no trouble, they would help each other with farming, holding a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other. The whole village was under unified leadership, and each village also had its own person in charge. Now the masses are clamoring for weapons, some even bringing out old-fashioned guns and cannons. Everyone is in high spirits. They said: "In the past, we were united and armed, and we repelled several bandit raids. Now we can also stop the bad guys." The whole village organized thirty-eight armed mutual aid groups, totaling six hundred forty-seven people.
