Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 18th: According to delayed reports from Shanghai newspapers: On May 9th, a massive riot occurred in Anqing, the former capital of Anhui Province, where ten thousand people attacked the local Chiang Kai-shek bank in protest against the forced purchase of military grain. The bank, under orders from the Chiang government, was to purchase 2,500 shi (approximately 350,000 kg) of military grain with 250 million Chiang currency (Note: equivalent to 100,000 yuan per shi; while the actual grain price in the Chiang-controlled areas has already exceeded 1 million yuan per shi. This is not "purchase," but outright plunder). Upon hearing the news, the citizens were filled with indignation, and the masses thoroughly destroyed the bank and the residence of its director, He Miting. The puppet police even opened fire to suppress the crowd, killing the owner of a small business, the "Global" calligraphy brush shop, and injuring two others.

Another dispatch: In Chiang Kai-shek's capital, Nanjing, several armed policemen are stationed at the entrance of every rice shop to prevent rice looting.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: As rice looting riots continue to occur in Chengdu, six county towns in Sichuan, including Neijiang and Rongchang in southern Sichuan, Guanxian and Luojiang in western Sichuan, Luxian, an important port on the Yangtze River, and Emei in southwestern Sichuan, which are abundant rice-producing areas, also experienced rice looting incidents in early and mid-June. In Luxian and Emei, after looting rice, the starving people also destroyed the township government, raising the slogan of "eat the big landlords." In Neijiang, the entire city's starving people mobilized to loot rice. Longchang, Zhangming, and Maogong, along with the aforementioned counties, are all experiencing widespread grain shortages. In Guanxian, a poor farmer named Liu, living at the foot of Lingcui Mountain, due to unbearable living conditions, shockingly boiled his two young sons alive in a pot on June 4th, and buried his beloved daughter alive in the wilderness. This incident caused a sensation throughout Guanxian. In Maogong, the price of rice has risen to 1 million yuan per shi, and sweet potatoes have reached 10,000 yuan per jin (0.5 kg). Restaurants in Emei, Longchang, Zhangming, Lu, Guan, and other counties have been forced to close due to the inability to purchase grain. A diner in Luxian bitterly joked: Today, going to a restaurant means only getting a "closed door." In the six counties of Ya'an, Tianquan, Rongjing, Baoxing, and Hanyuan in Xikang, even seeds cannot be obtained, and farmers can only watch their fields become barren.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: According to Shanghai newspapers: In mid-May, the people of Yuanjiang, Hunan, collectively captured the county magistrate. The reason was that the county government decided to control the city's manure for new exploitation. The women of the city rose up in opposition and destroyed public toilets. The Chiang Kai-shek county government arrested the leaders of the masses and tortured them. The women responded to the call and gathered more than 500 people to surround the county government, demanding their release. The Chiang police opened fire on the unarmed women, killing and injuring several people. The people of the entire city were furious and stormed into the county government, capturing the Chiang Kai-shek county magistrate on the spot. The Chiang police, seeing the situation was unfavorable, fled in all directions. The entire city was in chaos for two days.

    【新华社华中十八日电】据沪报迟到消息：原安徽省会安庆五月九日曾发生万人袭击该县蒋记银行，反对购买军粮的大骚动。因该银行受蒋政府令以二亿五千万蒋币购军粮二千五百石（按：合十万元一石；而蒋区实际粮价每石已在一百万元以上。这不是“购”，实与掠夺无异。）市民闻讯，群情激愤，乃群众彻底捣毁该银行及行长何蔑廷住宅。伪警竟开枪镇压，击毙小商号“全球”毛笔店店主一名，伤两名。
    【又讯】蒋家首都南京每家米店门口均派有武装警察数名，以防抢米。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】当成都不断发生抢米骚动之际，四川许多产米丰盛之区，包括川南之内江、荣昌，川西之灌县、罗江，长江要埠泸县，川西南之峨嵋等六县城亦于六月上中旬发生抢米风潮。泸县峨嵋饥民抢米后，并捣毁乡公所；饥民提出“吃大户”口号。内江则全城饥民均出动抢米。隆昌、彰明、懋功遵同上列各县遍呈粮荒状态，灌县灵崔山下一刘姓贫民因生活难熬，于六月四日竟将其两幼子投入沸水锅烫死，将其爱女掘坑活埋于荒野，此事一时轰动灌县全城。懋功米价每石长至百万元，洋芋每斤已达一万元。峨嵋、隆昌、彰明、泸、灌等县的饭店因无法购粮均紧关店门，泸县某食客苦笑说：今天上饭店只能吃到“闭门羹”。西康之雅安、天全、荣经、宝兴、汉源六县连种籽亦无法获得，农民坐看田地荒芜。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】据沪报讯：湖南沅江人民于五月中旬群众捉拿该县县长。缘因该县县府决定统制全城粪便，从事新的剥削，该城妇女群起反对，并捣毁公共厕所。蒋记县府逮捕群众首领，加以拷打，妇女一呼百应，集结五百余人，层层包围县府，要求释放。蒋警竟向徒手妇女开枪，死伤数人，全城人民震怒，冲入县府，当场擒获蒋记县长，蒋警见势不妙，纷纷化装如鸟兽散。全城混乱达两日。
