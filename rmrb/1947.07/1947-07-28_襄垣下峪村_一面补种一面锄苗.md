　　Xiangyuan Xia Yu Village
　　Replanting While Weeding
　　[Report from this newspaper] The masses in Xia Yu Village, Xiangyuan First District, recalling the horrors of the 1943 famine, have launched a production increase and famine preparedness campaign. Every household is exchanging meals, and everyone is gathering wild vegetables. The masses are acting consciously and universally. On July 11th, after some light rain, everyone actively replanted late-season fields the next day. All able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers in the village participated, throwing themselves into the movement. In one day, they completed the replanting of 168 mu. Everyone unanimously believes that planting one more mu of land means harvesting a few more dou of grain in the fall. Regarding the protection of seedlings, according to statistics from the tenth group, a total of 3326.25 mu have been weeded twice, 135.5 mu have been weeded three times, and 270 mu have been top-dressed with fertilizer. Everyone is busy from dawn till dusk replanting, protecting seedlings, preparing for famine, and economizing, creating a lively and bustling movement. As He Cunxi said: "I'd rather get up early and work late to replant today than starve like I did in 1943!" (Production Increase and Famine Preparedness Report)
