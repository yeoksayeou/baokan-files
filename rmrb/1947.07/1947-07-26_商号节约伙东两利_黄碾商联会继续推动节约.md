　　Business Savings Benefit Both Partners and Owners
  　Huangnian Business Association Continues to Promote Thrift

　　[Our newspaper, Lucheng News] The Huangnian Village and Township Business Association cadres held an emergency meeting on the morning of the 19th of this month to discuss production, thrift, and famine preparedness. During the meeting, it was discovered that some merchants had muddled ideas, saying, "The harvest here is not bad. Wheat yields five or six dou per mu, not less. The autumn crops are growing well. If it rains for a few more cloudy days in June, it will be a good year." Industrial and Commercial Committee member Su Tuhai told everyone, "Look at the bigger picture. In other places, it hasn't rained, and the seeds haven't even been planted. Changzhi had hailstorms that damaged the crops. What good is it if only our place has a good harvest? During the third year of the Guangxu era, people were still starving to death under the ears of grain. We merchants should not be complacent anymore. It's really wrong to waste money on drinking, eating meat, and smoking cigarettes." Then, based on this experience, everyone discussed how to prepare for famine. Cao Zhongyi of the Victory Store said, "A month ago, my shop served rice and noodles every day, and the vegetable expenses alone were more than four hundred yuan. Later, an eight-person partners' meeting was held to discuss: This is too extravagant; the money we earn is all eaten up. Later, it was changed to cornmeal every five days, and each meal only required two sheng of millet. This not only saves grain but also saves on vegetable expenses. Two hundred yuan a day for vegetable expenses is enough. If this continues, we can save more than 20,000 yuan per month. Changing from smoking cigarettes to smoking water pipes will save enough money to pay the full year's business tax. Earning money is also beneficial to the partners' dividends, and everyone is very satisfied." The manager of Yumin Store said, "In the future, we must not only be thrifty but also sell fewer useless consumer goods." After this discussion, more than 120 business households actively held partners' meetings and formulated thrift plans. Fifteen families have already begun to dig wild vegetables and grind cornmeal in restaurants, taking practical actions to prepare for famine. (Xingfu)

　　商号节约伙东两利
  　黄碾商联会继续推动节约
    【本报潞城讯】黄碾村镇商联会干部于本月十九号上午召开紧急会议，讨论生产节约备荒，会上发现商人中有些糊涂想法，说：“咱们这里年景不歪，麦子每亩收五、六斗没有少打，秋庄稼长的还不坏，六月再连阴上几天就是好年景。”工商委员苏秃孩给大家说：“眼往大处瞧，别的地方没落雨种籽还没有下到地，长治下了冰雹，打坏了庄稼，光咱这个地方庄稼好，能顶什么用，光绪三年时谷穗底下还要饿死人。我们商人不应再麻痹，吃酒吃肉吃纸烟的浪费真不应该。”接着大家根据这段经验讨论了如何备荒的问题，胜利商店曹中义说：“前一个月我柜上是一米一面，每天光菜钱得四百余元，后召开伙友八人会议讨论说：这样太利害，赚的钱都吃光了，后改为五天一顿玉茭面，每顿吃小米二升就行了，不但省粮食也省菜钱，每天二百元菜钱就满可以了，这样下去每个月可节省两万余元，吃纸烟改为吃水烟，节约下来的钱，就够全年交商业税款，赚下钱对伙友们分红也有利，大家很满意。”裕民商店经理说：“今后不但要节约，还要少卖无用消耗品。”经过这样讨论后，一百廿余户商号都积极召开伙友会纷纷订节约计划。现在已有十五家立即进行拔野菜，饭店磨玉茭面，用实际行动进行备荒。（兴福）
