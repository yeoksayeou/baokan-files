　　[Report from our newspaper] The Fushan Shi Zhenming United Brigade is seizing the opportunity to hoe seedlings and combat drought. Currently, most of the 8,745 mu of corn has been hoed twice, with some plants growing to two chi tall. Over 7,860 mu of millet has been hoed once and has grown to a little over one chi tall. In particular, the new hero Wang Fuquan and the old hero Zhao Meiying are performing even better. Their two groups, consisting of over twenty people, have hoed all of their hundred-plus mu of autumn seedlings twice, and the seedlings are growing very well, and the fields are very clean. Under their influence, mutual aid groups have further expanded. Now the United Brigade has developed to sixty-seven groups with four hundred and eighty-nine women.

　　[Report from our newspaper] Since the Wei County Shengfotang Mutual Aid Group decided to clear accounts every year on the three festivals, it has greatly increased the production enthusiasm of the masses. Especially after the May 5th account clearing, both grain-delivering and grain-earning households have been very active. Zhang Fulin and Guo Jincheng, who used to be afraid of working for free and had low mutual aid enthusiasm, now continue to work even when experiencing malaria attacks and carry water to fertilize the cesspool even at night after returning home. After everyone's production enthusiasm increased, each group formulated a fine cultivation plan of hoeing five times. Now all fourteen qing of autumn seedlings in the village have been hoed three times. Under the leadership of Labor Hero Shi Decai and Geng Lanyu, they are brewing the establishment of an advanced mutual aid group, and seven households have voluntarily requested to join.

　　[Another dispatch] The Qinyuan Cao Xianliang Mutual Aid Brigade collapsed during this year's spring plowing because of inappropriate handling of wages and leadership issues last year. It has recently become active again after more than twenty days of rectification. During the rectification, it was first discovered that the cadres did not work last year and deliberately set the wages low. Generally, it was five sheng of rice per work unit, but they set it at three sheng, and even if the work was paid during spring plowing, the wages were not received during the autumn harvest. Secondly, last year, the land of fifty-two military dependents was all cultivated by the mutual aid group, and those who did not participate in the mutual aid did not need to provide preferential treatment to military families, making everyone feel that participating in the mutual aid was a disadvantage. Thirdly, the county and district leadership did not provide specific guidance, and Brigade Leader Wang Shuan wasted too much work time. Cao Xianliang also had private life issues, which made him feel down. After inspection, it was decided to transform the leadership and establish a production committee to be responsible for leadership inspection. Wages are uniformly based on the market price of millet, and accounts are settled once a season. Preferential treatment for military families is uniformly handled by the whole village. In this way, the whole village's production enthusiasm has greatly improved. Out of the two hundred and seven full and semi-laborers in the whole village, one hundred and seventy-eight have rejoined the mutual aid. Within twelve days, they have hoed all one thousand eight hundred and twenty-four mu of autumn seedlings.

　　[Report from our newspaper in Shahe] When Liu Qingyun, a second-class labor hero of Taihang, was leading the masses in hoeing seedlings, because the land area was not large during the rush planting and the seedlings emerged during a very dry period, the group members were not actively hoeing. Some said, "The seedlings are dry and will soon wither. It costs six jin of rice a day to hoe in the mutual aid group. I'll just hoe my field slowly myself." After Liu Qingyun saw this problem, he immediately discussed it with everyone, saying that the later the seedlings are hoed, the more they will be damaged. Whether you do mutual aid or not, you still need to hoe. In any case, mutual aid is faster! The drier the weather, the sooner you should hoe the seedlings. If you are afraid of paying wages, we can exchange labor for labor. If there are no dry land seedlings, we can use irrigation to repay the work, so you don't need to pay wages. The masses' enthusiasm for mutual aid increased greatly. During the rush hoeing, they also circled the roots of the seedlings with soil, which made them both drought-resistant and wind-resistant. They have now completed the second hoeing. (Kui Lin)

　　石振明大队扩大妇女互助
  　抓紧锄苗万五千亩
  　圣佛堂互助组订出锄苗五遍精耕计划
    【本报讯】浮山石振明联合大队抓紧锄苗抗旱工作，现在八千七百四十五亩玉茭，已大部锄过了二遍，长的有二尺高。七千八百六十多亩谷子已锄完头遍，也长到有一小尺高。特别是新英雄王福全，旧英雄赵美英作的更好，他们两组二十多个人，一百多亩秋苗全都锄过了二遍，苗子长的很好，地里边也非常干净。在他们的影响之下，互助组更扩大了，现在联合大队的妇女已发展至六十七组四百八十九人。
    【本报讯】威县圣佛堂互助组，自决定每年三节清帐后，大大提高了群众生产情绪，特别在五月五清帐以后，无论出粮、挣粮户均甚积极。张福林、郭金成，过去怕白给人干，互助情绪不高，现在发着疟子一晌不隔，夜晚回家还担水泼粪坑。大家生产情绪提高后，各组即定出锄五遍的精耕计划，现全村十四顷秋苗已锄完三遍。在劳英石德才、耿兰玉领导下，正酝酿成立高级互助组，并有七户自动要求参加。
    【又讯】沁源曹显亮互助大队，在去年因工资和领导等问题处理不适当，今年春耕中就垮台了。近经二十余天的整顿，又开始活跃起来。整顿中，首先检查出去年干部不劳动，专把工资定小，一般是一工五升米，他们定为三升，并且还是春耕时支了工，收秋时还得不到工资。其次是去年把五十二户军属地，都由互助组耕种，不参加互助的人便不用优军，弄得谁也觉得参加互助吃亏。第三、县区领导上没有具体指导，大队长王拴领导误工太多，曹显亮又有私生活问题，弄得情绪不高。检查后决定改造领导，成立了生产委员会负责领导检查。工资一律以市价小米为标准，一季清算一次。优军由全村统一负责。这样全村生产情绪大为提高，全村全半劳力二百零七人，重新参加互助的已有一百七十八人，十二天内，已将秋苗一千八百二十四亩全部锄完。
    【本报沙河讯】太行二等劳动英雄刘清云领导群众锄苗时，因为抢种时垧就不大，苗出来天又很旱，组员们都不积极的锄，有的说：“苗子旱巴巴的就快干坏啦，互助锄一天地还得出六斤米，我的田就自己慢慢锄吧。”刘清云看到这个问题后，便马上和大家商量，苗子锄的越迟就越受伤，不互助也是锄，互助也是锄，怎也是互助快多哩！天越旱越应早锄苗，怕出工资咱们劳力折劳力，没旱地苗的咱用浇地还工，都不用出工资。群众互助劲头大起来，他们抢锄中还把苗的根部都围了一圈土，这样又耐旱又不怕风刮。现已锄完第二遍。（奎林）
