　　American Progressive Citizens Association
  　Condemns Republican and Democratic Parties
  　Passes Resolution Considering Third Party Movement
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: New York dispatch: The American Progressive Citizens Association, an influential political group in the United States, held a national council meeting in Chicago on June 28th and 29th, passing a resolution to consider a third-party movement and deciding to support a progressive presidential candidate in next year's presidential election. It also severely condemned the current reactionary policies of the alliance between the American Democratic and Republican parties. The resolution stated: "Unless the Democratic Party puts forward a progressive platform and progressive candidates in next year's election, the American Progressive Citizens will be willing to consider a third-party movement." The association decided to cooperate with other politically independent groups in the United States in the upcoming presidential election to support progressive presidential candidates. The resolution continued: "American voters should, if necessary, use a new party to ensure they have a clear choice between progressive and reactionary presidential candidates." The resolution pointed out that the alliance between the two parties has effectively formed a reactionary party to deceive the American people into making a progressive choice between the two. The alliance between the two parties and the Truman political group are responsible for the current dire situation in the United States. The resolution further pointed out that the two-party leadership has produced "the Truman Doctrine of military assistance to foreign autocratic governments, the Taft-Hartley anti-labor law, high prices and rents, the destruction of veteran housing, agricultural cultivation and rural electrification programs, and the attacks on civil rights, mob violence, and the inability to stop racial discrimination." Those attending the council meeting included Whitney, chairman of the Railway Trainmen's Union; Benson, former Governor of Minnesota; Foreman, chairman of the Southern Human Welfare Committee; Polbel, chairman of the National Lawyers Guild; Kenny, former Attorney General of California; and Budick, secretary of the North Dakota Democratic Party Central Committee. The association, led by Wallace, was established in New York on December 31st last year. In addition to individual members, group participants include the National Citizens Political Action Committee, the CIO Political Action Committee, and the Independent Scientific, Art and Professional Citizens Committee, among other fourteen groups. The association adopts a cooperative attitude towards the American Communist Party.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th: TASS, New York dispatch: The results of a survey by the extremely conservative "Public Opinion Polling Bureau" in the United States have confirmed that many American voters are increasingly dissatisfied with the lines of the Democratic and Republican parties and are willing to support a new progressive party. The bureau issued a report stating that, according to survey results, 19 percent of voters who elected Roosevelt in 1944 are willing to support a new party. The bureau pointed out that if a new party finally participates in the election, five million votes will be cast for the third-party candidate. Twenty-two percent of trade union members have expressed support for a third party. Based on these Q&A results, the bureau warned against underestimating the role a third party may play in lower-level elections. The report stated that the establishment of a third party would prove to be a great distress to the Democratic Party because the new party may win over voters who have hitherto supported the Democratic Party.

　　美国进步公民协会
  　谴责共和民主两党
  　通过决议考虑第三党运动
    【新华社陕北五日电】纽约讯：美国有势力的政治团体美国进步公民协会，于六月二十八、二十九两日在芝加哥召开全国理事会，通过决议考虑第三党运动，并决定在明年总统选举中支持进步的总统候选人；对美国民主共和两党联盟的现行反动政策也加以严厉谴责。决议称：“除非民主党在明年大选中提出进步的纲领和进步的候选人，则美国进步公民将愿考虑第三党运动。”该协会决定在未来总统选举中和美国其他政治独立团体合作，支持进步的总统候选人。决议继称：“美国选民必要时应以新党保证其在进步与反动总统候选人中有明确的选择机会。”决议指出：两党联盟实际上成立了一个反动的政党，以欺骗美国人民在两者间作进步的选择。两党联盟和杜鲁门政治集团应对美国当前的糟糕情况负责。决议进一步指出：两党领导产生了“军事援助国外独裁政府的杜鲁门主义。塔虎脱、哈特莱反劳工法，高昂的物价和房租，退伍军人住屋，农业垦植及农村电气化计划的破坏，以及公民权利的遭受打击，暴徒行凶和种族岐视的无法制止。”出席此次理事会者有铁路车务工人工会主席惠特尼、前明尼苏达州州长宾生、南方人类福利委员会主席福尔曼、全国律师公会主席泼贝尔、前加州司法部长肯尼、北达科他州民主党中央委员会书记布狄克。按该协会去年十二月三十一日由华莱士领衔成立于纽约，除个人会员外，团体参加者有全国公民政治行动委员会、产联政治行动委员会、独立科学艺术职业公民委员会等十四个团体。该协会对美共采取合作态度。
    【新华社陕北五日电】塔斯社纽约讯：美国极端保守的“民意测验局”的测验结果，证实了美国许多选民对民主与共和两党的路线日益不满，并愿支持新的进步政党。该局发表报告称：据测验结果，一九四四年选举罗斯福的选民中，有百分之十九愿意支持新党。该局指出：如新党终于参加选举，将有五百万选票投给第三党候选人。职工会会员有百分之二十二，表示赞成第三党。根据这些问答结果，该局警告不要低估第三党在下层选举中可能起的作用。报告称：第三党的成立将证明是对民主党的极大苦恼，因为新党可能把迄今支持民主党的选民争取过去。
