　　In coordination with our army's crossing of the Yellow River to launch a major counteroffensive, another powerful field army under General Liu Bocheng has also begun a major counteroffensive, launching a pincer offensive on the northern Henan front along the Pinghan and Daoqing Railways. At 12:00 PM on the 4th, the People's Liberation Army on the Daoqing Railway line launched a fierce attack on Bo'ai, an important county town on the line. After a five-minute battle, the People's Liberation Army scaled the city walls. By 3:00 PM, the battle was completely over, and the city was recovered. The enemy's 117th Brigade artillery battalion, the 38th Division artillery company, and the entire Bo'ai Security Regiment were annihilated, killing and wounding over 600 enemy soldiers, and capturing the artillery battalion commander, the Kuomintang Bo'ai County Chief, and the county Security Regiment Commander Wang Quanqing and 1,300 others. Two field guns, four anti-tank guns, three mortars, five small cannons, two grenade launchers, six heavy machine guns, forty-five light machine guns, and 750 rifles were seized. The next day, our army took advantage of the victory and marched south, and Qinyang County, at the western end of the Daoqing Railway, was immediately recovered by our forces. On the Pinghan Railway line, the People's Liberation Army also launched a powerful offensive on the 29th, successively recovering Fengqiu, Yanjin, Hua County, and other county towns. Changyuan County, on the north bank of the Yellow River, is also completely surrounded by our troops. Currently, the Kuomintang troops in Xinxiang are becoming increasingly isolated, and our offensive is continuing to expand.

　　[News from the Northern Henan Front]: Lü Dengke, one of the 180 heroes who defended Zhang Fengji, wrote a letter to his senior leaders expressing his determination to make great contributions in the counteroffensive. The original letter stated: "I received your letter, and I have kept your words in my heart. I will practice martial arts diligently, and I guarantee to reach 40 meters in grenade throwing within five days. I will definitely lead the second squad well, and I will never forget to lead the masses to make contributions for the people." It turns out that when Lü Dengke returned to his unit from the hospital on the 17th, the senior leaders of the unit sent a letter commending him for leading everyone to make contributions in martial arts practice and in the upcoming major counteroffensive. After receiving this letter, Hero Lü's eyes narrowed into a line, and he immediately ran to ask the instructor to write a reply on his behalf. Chen Shiming, a young hero in the same company and first squad, who is known as "Little Lü Dengke," also competed with him in leading troops and practicing martial arts. This competition greatly promoted the training movement in neighboring squads. Lü Dengke is only eighteen years old. After enlisting in the army, he fought his first battle against the Kuomintang's direct line troops—the First Division—in Zhang Fengji, establishing meritorious service with the great fearless spirit of an awakened peasant and earning the honor of hero.

　　[News from the Northern Henan Front, 6th]: Liu Jiande, the heroic soldier who disarmed the enemy with his bare hands during the Northern Henan campaign, returned to his unit to participate in training with seven unhealed wounds on his body. When he heard the news in the hospital that a major counteroffensive was being prepared and that the troops were actively practicing martial arts to learn skills, he couldn't stay any longer. He felt very uncomfortable and requested permission from the hospital to return to the team. After returning to the unit, everyone comforted him, and he constantly praised the thorough care provided by the field hospital and the benefits of the new treatment methods. He also said, "On the way from being wounded to the rear, the villagers bought chicken, fetched water, and prepared meals, taking very good care of me." He has been selected as the sixth-ranked heroic soldier in the brigade's Meritorious Service Celebration Meeting. (Image attached)
