Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 28th – The remnants of the 51st Division of Chiang Kai-shek's troops in Xin'an Town, south of the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, taking advantage of the heavy rain on the 9th and the rising water level of the Shu River, breached the outer river embankment. Houses and fields north of Longquan Ditch on the railway side were completely submerged, and the disaster-stricken people nested in tree ridges, their cries shaking the sky. Chiang's puppet troops stationed at the Shiziqiao stronghold on the northern section of the Huai(yin)-Shu(yang) Highway also destroyed more than a hundred yards of the Xinhe South Embankment on the night of the 16th, and immediately white waves surged. Many residents were swept away by the water. According to statistics, 2,000 square li of liberated area farmland was submerged in the two locations. This move by Chiang's troops shows that Chiang Kai-shek is about to widely adopt the utterly inhumane flood tactics.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 27th – According to people coming from western Henan: Chiang Kai-shek, fearing that the People's Liberation Army would cross the river, came up with the bizarre idea of conscripting "dog soldiers." The Chiang government recently ordered each bao (group of 100 households) to provide one dog with a 25-zhang (approximately 83 meters) rope, and supply the dog with three jin (approximately 1.5 kg) of wheat as food every day, intending to tie the dogs along the Yellow River to serve as sentries. Such "dog soldiers" have now been discovered along the riverbank in Xin'an.

　　蒋贼丧心病狂竟采泛滥战术
  　苏北蒋军掘溃沭河
  　当地人民房屋田禾尽被淹没
    【新华社华中二十八日电】陇海东段南侧新安镇蒋军五十一师残部，于九日乘大雨后，沭河水涨，掘开外河堤岸，铁路侧龙泉沟以北房屋田禾，尽被淹没，灾民巢居树岭，哭声震天。淮（阴）沭（阳）公路北段十字桥据点蒋伪，十六日夜亦掘毁新河南堤百余丈，顿时白浪滔天，不少居民被水卷没，据统计：二地淹没解放区良田达二千方里。蒋军此举显示蒋贼将普遍采用丧尽人性之泛滥战术。
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫二十七日电】据豫西来人谈：蒋贼怕解放军渡河，异想天开，征用“狗兵”。蒋政府近下令每保出狗一只，绳二十五丈，并每日供给狗粮麦子三斤，拟将狗拴于黄河沿岸，用以警戒。现新安境河沿，已发现此类“狗兵”。
