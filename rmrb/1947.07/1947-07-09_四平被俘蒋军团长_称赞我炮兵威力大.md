Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, July 7th: Our special correspondent Hua Shan reports: Chen Mingxin, the captured colonel and regiment commander of the 71st Army Special Service Regiment, said during a meeting with reporters several days after his capture: "I thought your artillery was Soviet. I didn't believe that the Democratic Allied Army's own artillery could have such power, destroying our three lines of defense in one night. I specifically observed your artillery positions along the way. Not only did I not see a single Soviet gun, but there were more American guns than Japanese guns. I didn't see any Soviets, but I saw several artillerymen from the 71st Army. I was too embarrassed to even look them in the eye." He is the younger brother of Chen Mingren, the army commander. When he was captured in the "core fortifications" of the army headquarters in Siping on the 21st of last month, he even denied his brotherly relationship with Chen Mingren and his own official position, and firmly said: "Please send my body to Siping after my death!" Now he is talking and laughing freely, and repeatedly explained to reporters: he was not captured but voluntarily laid down his arms. He used the words "foolish bravery" to criticize his brother, saying: "He thinks he is Chiang Kai-shek's favorite first-term student of Huangpu, but in fact, old Chiang 'doesn't need him much, and doesn't need him at all,' and specifically asks him to do the work of selling his life. He likes to wear high hats and likes people to compliment him on being 'brave.' This spring, when Dehui was surrounded, the New 1st Army and New 6th Army didn't dare to reinforce it. Du Yuming said: 'No one dares to relieve this siege except Commander Chen.' As soon as he heard this, he rashly ran away, leaving the 88th Division completely wiped out, the 87th Division also collapsed, and the army headquarters was also a mess. Our Special Service Regiment originally had 2,500 people, but this time only about 300 people were left. Last month, when Huai'de was surrounded, Du Yuming said again: 'Commander Chen will surely succeed in relieving the siege.' As soon as he heard this, he rushed over again. The troops that had been replenished with great difficulty were wiped out again in this battle, and all nine companies of my Special Service Regiment were wiped out. Only about a hundred people were left, and they were still half-crippled. Du Yuming is just like coaxing a child, and he has completely coaxed away his troops!" Turning to the topic of Chiang's army officers, he said: "In the past, when officers talked about it, they always said: 'Taking Harbin will be in the next few days!' 'It's not bad to go to Jiamusi for fun.' Now what they say is: 'Will the Communists attack here first?' 'How many days can that place hold?' After being annihilated in the spring (referring to the Battle of Dehui in February), the army headquarters reviewed the battle situation and believed that the Democratic Allied Army's summer offensive would not be launched until the end of June at the earliest. Unexpectedly, it was launched on May 13th. As a result, the estimate was wrong again. Who still has confidence!?" Finally, he said: "I feel that wearing an American hat in the past was a disgrace to the Chinese people. When I arrived in the Liberated Areas, I felt very relieved. I just want to move my mother to the countryside as soon as possible. I believe that the same blow will soon fall on Shenyang."

　　四平被俘蒋军团长  称赞我炮兵威力大
    【新华社东北前线七日电】本社特派记者华山报导：被俘数日后的七十一军特务团上校团长陈明信于会见记者时说：我以为你们的炮兵是苏联的，我不相信民主联军自己的炮兵有这样大的威力，曾在一个晚上把我们三道防线一气摧毁。我一路专门观察你们的炮兵阵地，不但看不到一门苏联炮，而且美国炮比日本炮还多，苏联人看不到，反而看见了几个七十一军的炮手，我遇见他们头也不好意思抬了。他是该军军长陈明仁的胞兄弟，上月二十一日当他在四平该军军部“核心工事”被俘时，还曾否认他与陈明仁的兄弟关系和自己的官职，并且坚决地说：“我死后请把尸首送到四平！”现在他却毫无拘束谈笑风生，并对记者反复说明：他不是被俘而是自动放下武器的，他用“匹夫之勇”四个字批评他的哥哥，说：“他以为自己是蒋介石喜爱的黄埔第一期学生，其实老蒋‘有他不多，无他不少’，卖命的事专门叫他做。他好戴高帽子，喜欢人恭维他‘勇敢’。今春德惠被围，新一军新六军都不敢增援，杜聿明就说：‘除陈军长无人敢解此围’，他一听就冒然跑去，把八十八师丢个精光，八十七师也垮了，军部也稀烂了。我们特务团原来有二千五百人，这一来只剩下三百来人。上月怀德被围，杜聿明又说：‘陈军长去解围一定得到成功。’他一听又冒冒失失跑去，好容易补充起来的队伍，这一打又打掉两个整师，把我特务团的九个连都全给打掉了，剩下百来人还是半彩号。杜聿明就象哄小孩子一样，把他的队伍给全部哄掉了！”话题转到蒋军军官身上，他说：“以前军官们谈起来，总是说：‘拿哈尔滨就这几天了！’‘到佳木斯玩玩也不错。’现在他们说都是：‘共军会不会先打这里？’‘那里还能守几天？’春季被歼（按指二月间德惠之役）后回来，军部曾检讨战局，认为民主联军夏季攻势最早要到六月底才能发动，想不到五月十三号就打响了。结果又估计错了，谁还有信心呢！？”最后他说：“我感到从前戴美国帽子是中国人民的耻辱。到了解放区我心坎很坦然，只想赶快把我母亲搬到乡下，我相信同样的打击，不久便会落到沈阳。”
