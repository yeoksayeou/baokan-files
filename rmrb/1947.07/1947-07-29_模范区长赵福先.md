　　Model District Chief Zhao Fuxian

At the commendation meeting in Xiuwu County, Comrade Zhao Fuxian was elected as a model district chief. Since the enemy's attack last year, he has never left the masses in the Third District. At that time, he served as the instructor of the armed work team, and this year he is the deputy district chief of the Third District. He leads the armed work team and the militia to operate behind enemy lines, often meeting the enemy, living under gunfire, and never shrinking back. Last year, when the enemy attacked, the leadership proposed to move the masses to the rear. Some of the masses were unwilling to move. He ran to six or seven villages a day and said to the masses: If you don't want to go to the rear, let's stick together. Immediately, the masses in each village were relieved, and he shared life and death with the masses, bravely and tenaciously persisting in the guerrilla war behind enemy lines. He led the militia to harass the enemy and puppets, and captured the despotic local self-defense corps, which gave the enemy a headache. His activities made the returning counter-settlement ringleaders in various villages afraid to carry out counter-settlements. When the enemy attacked Jinlingpo (June), he went behind enemy lines to conduct propaganda to the masses. When the enemy was stationed in Dalu Village, he persisted on Jiuli Mountain for six days and six nights with a few people, and constantly sabotaged the railway, personally lifting the rails. In March, after our Yubei campaign began, the enemy retreated to the dotted line. He led the militia in front to monitor and blockade the enemy. Sometimes when a large group of enemies came out, he and two or three others went near the enemy, throwing grenades and firing volleys to confuse the enemy, so that the enemy did not dare to advance. When small groups came out, he resolutely fought them back.

During the wheat harvest, they operated in front. Because the old folks in front were robbed clean by the enemy, the meals they made were not delicious, and some of the militiamen did not eat. He took the lead in picking up the bad food and eating it, and educated the militiamen, saying: The people have had everything in their homes robbed by the enemy, and life is really difficult. When the militiamen saw that the district chief could eat this food, they all went to eat it. During the wheat harvest, when a platoon of enemies attacked Xiazhuang to rob grain, he and the communicator rushed to the edge of the village with only two people, fired ten or so shots and threw a grenade, and the enemy fled upon hearing the news, failing to rob the grain. Another time, when seventy or so enemies came to the area of Yanmazhuang and Xiazhuang, he led a few militiamen to the entrance of Yanmazhuang Village, shouting "Catch them alive!" and firing guns and grenades, and the enemy turned around and ran. In the past seven or eight months, he has captured a total of fourteen secret agents, despotic landlords, and disintegrated five puppet self-defense corps members. More than ninety self-defense corps members in the areas of Dongxi Kongzhuang and Zhanggong did not work for the enemy, but secretly contacted us.

Comrade Fuxian has not left the masses for a single day since the enemy's attack, and has not stopped fighting the enemy for a single day. He often educates the militiamen he leads, has a democratic style, and humbly accepts correct opinions. The masses in the entire district warmly love him.

　　模范区长赵福先
    修武全县表功大会上，赵福先同志当选模范区长。自去年敌人进攻后，他始终没有脱离开过三区的群众，当时他担任武工队的指导员，今年又担任三区副区长，他带着武工队与民兵经常活动敌后，经常和敌人见面，在枪林弹雨之下生活着，毫不畏缩。去年敌进攻时，领导上提出让群众向后边转移，有些群众不愿转，他一天跑六七个村对群众说：你们不愿向后走，咱们就在一块坚持，即时各村群众安下心来，他就与群众同生死共患难，英勇顽强坚持着敌后游击战争，他带着民兵经常袭扰敌伪，捉奸霸自卫团，敌人对他非常头疼。他的活动使各村回来的倒算祸首，不敢倒算。敌进攻金岭坡时（六月），他就到敌后活动，对群众宣传，敌住大陆村时，他带着几个人在九里山坚持六天六夜，并经常不断的破击铁路，亲身抬铁轨。三月间我豫北战役开始后，敌退到点线上，他带着民兵在前边对敌监视封锁，有时敌大股出来，他三两人到敌附近，打手榴弹，排子枪，迷糊敌人，使敌未敢前进。小股出来，他就坚决打回去。
    麦收中他们活动到前边，前边老乡们因被敌抢的一空，作的饭不好吃，民兵有的不吃，他首先端起来吃坏饭，并教育民兵说：老百姓现在家里啥东西都被敌人抢走了，生活实在艰苦。民兵们见区长能吃这饭，一个个都去吃了。麦收中待王敌一排人进攻下庄抢粮，他与通讯员仅两个人，冲到村边，打了十来枪一个手榴弹，敌闻风逃窜，未得抢粮。又一次敌七十余到演马庄下庄一带，他带几个民兵冲到演马庄村头，呼喊“捉活的！”打枪手榴弹，敌扭头就跑。七八个月来，他共捉特务恶霸地主十四，瓦解伪自卫团员五个，东西孔庄，张弓一带九十余自卫团员，也不给敌干事，暗中与咱接头连系。
    福先同志自敌人进攻到现在没有一天离开过群众，没有一天不和敌搏斗，对他带的民兵经常进行教育，作风民主，虚心接受正确意见。全区的群众对他热忱的爱戴。
