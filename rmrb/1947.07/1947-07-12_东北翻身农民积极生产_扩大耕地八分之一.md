Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, July 7th: The peasants in the Northeast liberated areas who have turned over are not only fully planting all the cultivated land from last year this year, but also expanding the cultivated area by more than one-eighth of last year's cultivated land. According to incomplete statistics from 84 counties in the provinces of Songjiang, Mudanjiang, Hejiang, Jilin, Liaobei, Heilongjiang, and Nenjiang, which account for about half of the Northeast, the cultivated land sown this year reached more than 6,466,000 hectares (1 hectare = 10 mu), an increase of more than 789,100 hectares of newly reclaimed and fallow land compared to last year. Among them, major crops such as wheat, soybeans, and sorghum account for more than 70% of the cultivated area. In most counties, wheat sowing accounts for one-fourth to one-third of the cultivated area. According to experienced farmers in various places, the weather has been favorable since this spring. If no other disasters occur before the autumn harvest, a bumper harvest is definitely predictable.

    东北翻身农民积极生产
    扩大耕地八分之一
    【新华社东北七日电】东北解放区翻身农民，今年除完全种上去年全部耕地之外，并扩大耕地面积达去年耕地八分之一以上。据松江、牡丹江、合江、吉林、辽北、黑龙江、嫩江各省区约占东北半数的八十四个县不完全统计，今年耕地播种达六百四十六万六千余垧（每垧十亩），较去年增种生荒及熟荒七十八万九千一百余垧，其中麦子、大豆、高粱等主要农作物，占耕地面积百分之七十以上。大多县份麦子播种占耕地面积四分之一至三分之一。据各地老农称：今春以来风调雨顺，如在秋谷登场前无其他灾害发生，黄金满仓，定可预卜。
