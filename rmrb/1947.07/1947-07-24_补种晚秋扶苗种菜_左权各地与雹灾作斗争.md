　　Replanting Late Autumn, Supporting Seedlings, and Planting Vegetables
  　Left Quan Fights Against Hailstorms
    [This newspaper, Left Quan News] On the evening of the 12th of this month, Left Quan, in the upper and lower Zhuang Dongshan villages in the sixth district, and the Da and Xiao Nanzhuang areas in the fifth district, experienced hailstorms. At 3:00 PM on the 13th, the entire county, except for the fourth district, experienced widespread hailstorms again. The most severely affected areas included Yuanzhuang, Baiguansi, Baiyu and other villages in the seventh district, Gaomajiazhuang and Houzhang and other villages in the first district, and Qianmuchuan, Shibao and other villages in the third district. Except for some millet that still had some broken leaves remaining, all the corn, beans, hemp, and mixed fields were completely destroyed. In some cases, even the roots were washed away. In the most severely affected areas, the hail fell continuously for an hour, accumulating to a thickness of one and a half feet. The larger hailstones were the size of walnuts, and it took two days for them to melt completely. Some local people were disheartened and lay in bed, some even refusing to eat, saying that this was disaster upon disaster and there was no way to survive. Upon hearing the news, the county and district immediately sent cadres to the severely affected villages to mobilize and organize the masses. They first addressed the pessimistic and hopeless sentiments from an ideological perspective, promoting slogans such as: "Hailstorms cannot be stopped, pessimism leads nowhere, don't bow down to difficulties, only then will there be a way out, if it is destroyed then replant late, harvesting vegetables will also fill the stomach, support small seedlings to save lives, and engage in more sideline occupations to make up for the losses." Everyone was asked to repeatedly discuss this. In Yuanzhuang village alone, under the leadership of the model village head Yuan Shulin, after overcoming ideological barriers and arousing the will to fight, all the villagers, men, women, old and young, were organized to implement large-scale mutual assistance. Within two days, they managed to support 256 mu of affected seedlings, planted 48.5 mu of buckwheat, and sowed vegetables on 164.7 mu. The cooperative was immediately instructed to purchase late-season seeds, organize all the village's livestock to go out for long-term transportation, and send strong young laborers to take on contract work to dig medicinal herbs and burn asphalt. Women and children, as semi-auxiliary laborers, were engaged in replanting and collecting wild vegetables and fragrant pears as substitute foods. In Baiyu village, under the positive leadership and influence of labor hero Sun Lizhu, in addition to actively supporting the affected seedlings and replanting late crops, the entire village, men, women, old and young, were organized to engage in sideline occupations to collect substitute foods. They also discussed eliminating 300 mu of abandoned land to plant vegetables to make up for the losses and to survive the famine with bran and vegetable mixtures. He said, "We living people won't be pissed to death by urine. If there is no millet to eat, bran and vegetables will also fill the stomach. As long as everyone does not lose heart, difficulties can be overcome." Other villages are also engaged in a tenacious struggle against the famine.
