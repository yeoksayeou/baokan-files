    Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Hebei-Henan Border Region, 10th. A reporter from the front lines of Northern Henan reports: The battle to liberate Bo'ai City on the 5th demonstrated the improved combat effectiveness of the People's Liberation Army. Before the general offensive, the network of fire organized by each unit was extremely tight. As soon as the signal gun was fired, all enemy bunkers were immediately plunged into a sea of fire, preventing the enemy from even returning fire. In just fifteen minutes, our army completely crossed the barricades and outer trenches, climbed the city walls, and breached the gap. Subsequently, artillery of various calibers swept across the bunker complex within the city. In an instant, most of the city was under our control. The remaining enemy forces entrenched in the bunkers in the southeast corner of the city wall, seeing that the situation was hopeless, surrendered their weapons. This time, because the commanders and fighters of the attacking forces were able to combine bravery with skill, casualties were extremely low.

    攻克博爱城战斗中显示我战斗力提高
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十日电】豫北前线记者报导：五日解放军攻克博爱城战斗中，显示人民解放军战斗力的提高。总攻之前，各部组织之火网至为严密，当信号枪一响，敌人所有碉堡，顿时坠入火海中，使敌未及还枪。仅十五分钟，我军即全部攻过鹿砦和外壕，登上城墙，突破缺口，随着各种口径炮，横扫城内碉堡群。顷刻之间，城内大部即为我控制，最后盘踞城墙东南角碉堡顽抗之残敌，见大势已去，缴枪投降。此次由于攻城部队指战员皆能使勇敢与技术结合，故伤亡极小。
