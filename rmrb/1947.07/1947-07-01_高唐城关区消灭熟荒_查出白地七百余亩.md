　　Gaotang Chengguan District Eliminates Cultivated Wasteland
  　Discovers Over 700 Mu of Uncultivated Land
    [This newspaper, Jinan, 27th dispatch] After a crash replanting following the rain, Gaotang Chengguan District believed that the uncultivated land and cultivated wasteland had been almost eliminated in each village. However, after door-to-door inspections, there were still more than three *qing* of uncultivated land in Northeast Guan, and 190 *mu* in South Guan South Street. There was also a considerable amount of uncultivated land in Xiaoshizhuang and West Guan West Street. After replanting 2,342 *mu* in the above four villages, a total of 774 *mu* of uncultivated land was discovered again. The First District has now decided to conduct a more thorough inspection and resolutely achieve the elimination of uncultivated land and not let an inch of land go to waste.
    [This newspaper, Zuoquan dispatch] The Third District is inspecting and eliminating cultivated wasteland to increase production and ensure military and civilian food supplies. After the masses were emancipated and allocated good land, the phenomenon of not planting on cultivated wasteland was commonly discovered in every village. The main reason is the dislike of delaying work. For example, in Songshuping, 228 *mu* of cultivated wasteland was not planned to be planted. If each *mu* produced three *dou* less, the grain production would be reduced by more than 68 *shi*. On the 13th of last month, the district convened a meeting of key village cadres and labor heroes to study the elimination of cultivated wasteland. Zhangba Village planned to use the method of changing stubble, planting millet on land prepared for planting buckwheat, and planting buckwheat on cultivated wasteland. In Wulihou, mutual aid teams formed shares to plant wasteland, and shares were distributed equally in the fall, with households without labor using seeds as shares. After the discussion, each village was determined to go back and mobilize the masses to thoroughly eliminate cultivated wasteland. (Wang Rizeng)

　　高唐城关区消灭熟荒
  　查出白地七百余亩
    【本报冀南二十七日电】高唐城关区经过雨后突击抢种，各村都以为白地熟荒被消灭的差不多了，但经过挨户检查，东北关白地仍有三顷多，南关南街也有一百九十亩，小氏庄、西关西街白地也不少，以上四村这次抢种了二千三百四十二亩后，总计又查出白地七百七十四亩，现一区决定再作深入检查，坚决作到消灭白地、不荒一寸土。
    【本报左权讯】三区为增加生产，保证军需民食，检查消灭熟荒。群众翻身以后，分上了好地，村村普遍发现不种熟荒现象。主要原因是嫌误工。如松树坪就有二百二十八亩熟荒地不准备种了，如以每亩少打三斗计，就要减去产粮六十八石多。上月十三号区召开了各村主要干部及劳动英雄会议研究消灭熟荒。丈八村计划用改茬办法，把准备种莜荞麦地先种成黍，熟荒地种成莜荞麦；五里堠是互助组结股种荒地，到秋天收股均分，没劳力户种籽顶股。研究后各村都决心回去动员群众彻底消灭熟荒。（王日曾）
