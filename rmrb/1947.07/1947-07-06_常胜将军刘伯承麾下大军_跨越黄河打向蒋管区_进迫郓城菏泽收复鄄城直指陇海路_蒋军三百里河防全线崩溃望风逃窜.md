　　General Liu Bocheng's Victorious Army
  　Crosses the Yellow River to Strike at the KMT-Controlled Areas
    Pressing Towards Yuncheng and Heze, Recapturing Juancheng, and Heading Straight for the Longhai Railway
  　Chiang's Army's Three Hundred Li River Defense Line Collapses Entirely, Fleeing in Panic
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front, 3rd dispatch] Our special correspondent Li Pu reports: General Liu Bocheng's army crossed the Yellow River on a three-hundred-li-wide front in western Shandong on the evening of the 30th. Chiang's army's river defense line, spanning approximately three hundred li, has completely collapsed. Our Liberation Army is taking advantage of the victory to penetrate deep into the KMT's territory. As of the time of this dispatch, they have advanced over one hundred li. The glorious prelude to the People's Liberation Army's great counter-offensive has thus been successfully launched. The 55th and 68th Divisions, among other KMT river defense forces, despite repeated orders from Chiang Kai-shek's Ministry of National Defense to hold their ground, were met with a fierce and courageous crossing by our Liberation Army under the cover of powerful firepower. The soldiers, numbering in the thousands, displayed magnificent momentum. The KMT soldiers guarding the river fired a few shots in a perfunctory manner before turning tail and running. Those who failed to escape were completely annihilated. In one area alone, the number of those annihilated reached one thousand. Cao Fulin, commander of the 55th Division, and part of his division, are currently besieged in the isolated city of Yuncheng. Mi Wenhe, commander of the 181st Brigade, abandoned Juancheng in a panic at 10 p.m., fleeing to Heze overnight. The Liberation Army in the west entered Juancheng and, taking advantage of the victory, advanced rapidly, reaching the outskirts of Heze City on July 1st. There are no traces of Chiang's troops north of this area. Other units of the Liberation Army are advancing separately. Recalling that Chiang Kai-shek violated the agreement on March 20th and prematurely closed the gap at Huayuankou to release the floodwaters, his minions rejoiced wildly, boasting that the natural barrier of the Yellow River was equivalent to a force of 400,000 soldiers, believing that they could trap General Liu on the north bank. Unexpectedly, after only three months, the so-called 400,000 divine soldiers have so quickly and incompetently fallen at the feet of the People's Liberation Army. Chiang Kai-shek's Longhai Railway is once again exposed to the Liberation Army. Even more exciting events are yet to come. The evening of the 30th was the eve of the 26th anniversary of the Communist Party of China – the eve of "July 1st". General Liu Bocheng's ever-victorious army presented the victory over the Yellow River, which was equivalent to 400,000 Chiang's troops, as a gift to the Party. All commanders and soldiers were extremely excited. (Attached picture)

　　常胜将军刘伯承麾下大军
  　跨越黄河打向蒋管区
    进迫郓城菏泽收复鄄城直指陇海路
  　蒋军三百里河防全线崩溃望风逃窜
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线三日电】本社特派记者李普报道：刘伯承将军麾下大军，已于三十日晚在鲁西地区三百华里宽的正面横渡黄河。蒋军约近三百华里的河防战线全线崩溃，解放军乘胜深入蒋军纵深，截至发电时止，已达一百华里以上。人民解放军大反攻的光荣序幕就此顺利揭开。五十五师和六十八师等河防蒋军，虽经蒋记国防部一再严令坚守，但我解放军在强大火力掩护下，勇猛强渡，千军万马，声势豪壮，守河蒋军虚晃三枪，回头就跑；不及逃跑者，悉数被歼。仅在某一地区，被歼者即达一千人。五十五师师长曹福林和该师一部，正被围于郓城孤城中。一八一旅旅长米文和则于深夜十点钟仓惶放弃鄄城，连夜向菏泽逃去。西面解放军进驻鄄城后，乘胜长驱直入，于七月一日进到菏泽城郊，该地以北已无蒋军踪迹。其他各部解放军，正在分头前进中。回忆蒋介石于三月二十日破坏协议，提早在花园口合龙放水，大小喽罗们欢喜如狂，大说其黄河天险等于四十万大军的神话，满以为可以困阻刘将军于北岸。不料为时仅仅三个多月，所谓四十万神兵就如此迅速和无能地躺倒在人民解放军脚下，蒋介石的陇海路又一次暴露在解放军面前，更精彩的节目就在后面。三十日晚正是中国共产党二十六周年纪念日——“七一”的前夜，刘伯承常胜军以战胜相当于四十万蒋军的黄河作为给党的献礼，全体指战员莫不兴奋万分。（附图片）
