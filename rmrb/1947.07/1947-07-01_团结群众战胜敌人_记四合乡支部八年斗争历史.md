　　Unite the Masses to Defeat the Enemy
  　A Record of the Eight-Year Struggle History of the Sihe Township Branch
    邢崇智
  　I. Great Development of Farmers' Associations and Militias, Jointly Overthrowing the Old Regime.

　　The Sihe Township Branch in She County, since its establishment in 1940, has led the masses in the struggle against the landlord class. At that time, the Anti-Japanese government was established, and an order was issued to reform the village regime. However, the village regime was controlled by landlords, and the masses had a "changing heavens" mentality, so all the government's decrees could not be implemented in Sihe Township. At that time, the branch only had five party members, so they first organized the masses: The first step was to mobilize young people to participate in the militia, and later they mobilized old men to join the farmers' association. Under the active mobilization of party members, more than ninety old men participated in the farmers' association, and more than twenty young people participated in the militia, forming the main force in the struggle. To reform the village regime, they first replaced the Jia heads, and then the Lu heads. After replacing the Jia and Lu heads with basic masses, they immediately brought out the accounts of the old village cadres for liquidation, calculating a total of 12,000 yuan of embezzled money, which was used to relieve poor farmers. In this way, all the main work of the village was in the hands of party members and poor masses, which was the first victory.

    II. The Masses in Power, Fair Burdens.

　　After overthrowing the old regime, the peasants stepped onto the political stage and first seized on the demands of the masses to carry out the struggle against unfair burdens. Because when the old village cadres were in power, they transferred the burdens to the peasants. When the new cadres came to power, they immediately investigated the burden households, mobilized the masses to rise up against the unfair burdens, and improved the financial organization. Party cadres took control of the finances, and eight committee members were selected from each street for calculation. In addition, other party members were organized to lead the militia to search the landlords' homes for stored grain and deposits, and a total of more than thirty stone of stored grain and more than four thousand catties of pepper were found. From then on, the burdens were fair, which greatly excited the masses. Also, because many poor households cultivated land in Licheng, the entire population of their families was counted in this village, and the land in Licheng did not deduct consumption, only burdens (Licheng was also controlled by landlords), the peasants could not bear it, and the cadres led the masses to liquidate it. After much effort, they were victorious, and a total of more than seven Qing of burdened land was calculated back. From then on, the masses supported us and approached us even more.

    III. Departing from Shentou and Dongyangguan, Eliminating Rent and Restoring Tenancy Shook the Heavens.

　　Although the burdens were fair, the peasants were still severely exploited by the landlords. At that time, they rented the wasteland of the first three surnames (Feng, Miao, Shen). They started renting out the wasteland slopes as soon as they were rented, and then increased the rent year by year. If they harvested one dou, they had to give eight sheng (the landlord made three dou extra). The landlords could freely seize the pumpkins and beans in the rented land. At that time, the work in Shentou was also opened up, so they cooperated with the peasants in Shentou Village to fight down the landlord Shen Chenglie, and only then did they recover the land. After this victory, the party branch led the masses to Dongyangguan to reduce rent and restore tenancy. Originally, when the enemy was in Licheng, the landlords were afraid of being killed by the enemy if they cultivated the land, so they sublet the land to the peasants. The peasants had no land, so they risked their lives to cultivate it, and in the autumn, they split the harvest in half with the landlords. But after the enemy left, the landlords, on the pretext that they had left the land barren for them, took the land back all at once, and the peasants were left empty-handed. The cadres organized all the tenants, each carrying grain, and set off for Dongyangguan. The first struggle failed because the tenants were afraid of the landlords and dared not reason with them. The landlords were cunning, and the peasants dared not answer even when they were right. After camping in the dark, the party members educated the tenants, supported them, and were still afraid it wouldn't work, so they taught the tenants mouth to mouth to remember: "The land is your property right, and your right to perpetual tenancy should be guaranteed." "If you take the land, the compensation for loss is at least two dou per mu." They painstakingly taught the tenants in this way, so that they could read, learn, and recite it. At the meeting, the party members and tenants sat together to teach again. This was done four times in a row before it was considered a victory. This time, the tenancy right was restored for 288 mu of land, and 85 stone of grain was compensated for the loss. The peasants happily carried the grain home. From then on, the peasants' morale was extremely high, and they were closer to the party. At this time, the number of party members had grown to thirteen.

    IV. The Fierce Tiger Comes Down the Mountain, Advancing in Four Routes; Party Members Lead to Clear the Debts.

　　Following the victory in rent reduction, the masses were mobilized to clear debts. Because the peasants in this village were very poor, there were especially many who had debts, accounting for 50% of the households in the village. In Shenjia Village alone, 80% of the households had debts. In this way, the peasants had very little left over from their year's hard work after paying rent and interest. Every year during the New Year, they could not stay at home, and could only sneak home at the fifth watch on the first day of the new year. At that time, if this debt was not cleared, the peasants still would not be able to make it. Therefore, party members mobilized the masses to set off in separate routes, one route to Henan Shop (the main force), one route to Nanzhuang, one route to Shentou, and one route to Songjia Village in Licheng. Because they were people from the mountains, wearing tattered clothes with holes bitten by the landlords, their morale was extremely high. After arriving at Henan Shop, they piled up at the landlord's house and reasoned with them. They would not leave unless the debt was cleared. At this time, the people on the street said, "Wow! These people are like fierce tigers coming down the mountain." Finally, the landlord was overwhelmed by the hundreds of righteous mouths, and the masses achieved victory. In addition to writing receipts, fifty documents were withdrawn. The other three routes also achieved victory in the same way. The peasants returned home with joy.

    V. Filling and Supplementing is Truly Fair; Cadres Get Less to Fill Extreme Poverty.

　　After the Nangang Training, the branch meeting was held first, and each party member made a plan not to be selfish or to cover up. Then, the masses were mobilized to reorganize the farmers' association, draw a clear line of class, and launched an unprecedented great struggle against the landlords. The peasants recovered 175 mu of land, found 1,300 silver dollars, 122 houses, 6 kiln caves, more than 80 stone of grain, 5 heads of livestock, and 310 pieces of clothing. At the end of the struggle, cadres first determined the principle in the distribution of fruits: cadres should get less than the masses within the same class. After filling and supplementing, all 25 extremely poor households were promoted to lower-middle peasants, and the landlord class was also destroyed economically and politically by the masses.

    VI. The Branch is as Close as a Family, a High Degree of Class Friendship.

　　Since its establishment, the branch has not had any disunity. When discussing work at meetings, they all put forward any opinions. They never complained behind their backs. If there were any minor disagreements in the work, they were cleared up with a review at the meeting. No one would hold grudges or retaliate. Their relationship with each other was as close as a family. The masses in the village were also so good. When the branch held a memorial meeting for the martyred comrades, the masses, after receiving the news, crowded to burn incense for the martyrs and see the names of the martyrs. They all knew that their liberation depended on these martyred martyrs. When Comrade Fen Shuqiao announced on stage that the five martyred comrades were communist party members, the masses suddenly realized that they had seen the communist party members they had long wanted to see. Hundreds of eyes were watching him speak. The Sihe Township Branch, in this way, was with the peasants and fought against the landlords for eight years. From beginning to end, they were closely united with the people, and now the branch has become the core of uniting the masses.

　　团结群众战胜敌人
  　记四合乡支部八年斗争历史
    邢崇智
  　一、农会民兵大发展，联合推倒旧政权。
    涉县四合乡支部从四○年建立起，就领导群众和地主阶级斗争，那时抗日政府成立，通令改造村政权，但该村政权被地主把持着，加之群众有变天思想，政府的一切法令在四合乡行不开。当时支部只有五个党员，便首先组织群众：第一步发动青年参加民兵，后来又动员老汉参加农会，在党员的积极动员下，有九十多个老汉参加了农会，二十多个青年参加民兵，组成了斗争中的主力军。改造村政权，首先换甲长，紧接着换闾长，把甲长闾长都换成基本群众后，紧接着把旧村干的帐搬出来进行清算，算出了贪污款一万二千元，救济了贫苦农民。这样全村主要工作都掌握在党员和贫苦群众手中了，这算第一次胜利。
    二、群众掌政，负担公平。
    推倒旧政权农民走上了政治舞台，首先抓住群众的要求，进行反负担不公斗争。因为旧村干当权时，把负担都转到农民身上，新干部上台，马上调查负担户，发动群众起来反不公平负担，健全了财政组织，党的干部掌握了财政，又从各街选了八个委员来进行计算，此外组织其他党员带领民兵到地主家找存粮存款，共搜出存粮三十多石，花椒四千余斤，从此负担公平，大大的兴奋了群众。又因为有很多贫户在黎城种地，家中人口全算到本村，黎城的地不除消耗，净出负担（黎城也是地主掌政），农民顶不住，干部又带领群众去清算，费了九牛二虎之力，胜利了，共算回负担地亩七顷多，从此群众更拥护我们靠近我们了。
    三、出发神头东阳关，灭租复佃惊动天。
    虽说负担公平了，但是农民受地主的剥削还很苛刻，当时租种头三姓荒地（冯、苗、申），开始租下荒坡就出租，以后一年年的增租，打一斗就出八升（地主自己制加三斗），租地内的南瓜、豆角地主随便去攫取，那时神头工作也开辟了，便协同神头村农民联合起来斗倒地主申成列，才把地收回来。这次胜利后，党的支部又领导群众到东阳关去减租复佃。原来敌人在黎城时，地主种地怕敌人打死，便将地转租给农民，农民没有地，自己舍命去种，秋后和地主半分。但敌人走后，地主们借口给他们荒了地，一下子把地收回了，农民落了个空。干部将所有佃户都组织起来，各带粮食出发到东阳关。头次斗争因为佃户怕地主，不敢说理，地主狡猾，农民有理不敢对答，斗争失败了。黑夜宿营后党员同志便教育佃户，给他们撑腰作主，还恐怕不行，又嘴对嘴教佃户记住：“地是你的所有权，应该保障俺永佃权。”“夺地包损失每亩最少包二斗。”就这样苦口婆心教会佃户，使他们念会学会背会。在会场上，党员和佃户坐到一块再教，这样一连搞了四次，才算胜利。这次恢复佃权地二百八十八亩，包损失粮八十五石，农民便兴高采烈的背着粮食归了家，从此以后农民情绪极高，更加靠近了党，这时党员发展到十三个人了。
    四、猛虎下山四路进兵，党员领导去把债清。
    接着减租胜利，又发动群众清债。因为这村农民很穷，揭债的特别多，全村有百分之五十户揭钱。单申家庄就有百分之八十户揭款。这样农民一年的血汗除交租上利外很少有剩余，每到过年都不能在家，到初一五更天才能偷偷的回家。当时如果不把这笔债清了，农民还是不行。因此党员发动群众分路出发，一路到河南店（主力军），一路到南庄，一路到神头，一路到黎城宋家庄，因为他们是山里边的人，穿着被地主咬下窟窿的破衣服，但他们的心劲是万分的高涨，到河南店后，便堆在地主家里进行说理，不清债就不走，这时街上的人说，呀！这伙人好象猛虎下了山。最后地主被这几百个正义的嘴压倒了，群众取得了胜利。除写了收据外，抽回五十张文书，其他三路也同样的得到胜利。农民喜天欢地的回了家。
    五、填平补齐真公平，干部少分填赤贫。
    南岗训后首先召开支部会议，各党员都订出自己不自私不包庇的计划，接着发动群众整理了农会划清阶级，便和地主展开了空前未有的大斗争，农民收回土地一百七十五亩，搞出现洋一千三百元，房屋一百二十二间，窑六孔，粮食八十多石，牲口五头，衣服三百一十件。斗争结束，在分果实中，干部先确定了原则，干部在同等阶层内要比群众少些。经填补后，二十五户赤贫全升到下中农了，地主阶级在经济上、政治上也被群众摧毁了。
    六、支部亲如一家，高度的阶级友爱。
    支部自成立到现在，没有出过任何不团结的事情，在会议上讨论工作的时候，有啥意见就都提出来了，在背后永不发怨言，工作发生些小意见，会上一检讨就清除了，任何人不会记仇，更不会报复，他们互相之间的关系亲热如一家。村上的群众也是这样好，支部召开追悼死难同志会，群众得到消息后，都拥挤去给烈士烧香，看烈士的名，他们都知道自己翻身是靠这些死难烈士的。分书乔同志上台宣布了五个死难同志是共产党员时，群众恍然大悟，自己见到了早想见的共产党员，千百双眼睛注视着他讲话。四合乡支部，就这样和农民在一起，和地主斗争了八年，他们自始至终是和人民紧紧的结合着，现在支部已成了团结群众的核心。
