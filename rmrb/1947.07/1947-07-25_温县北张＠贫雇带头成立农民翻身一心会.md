　　【Reported from Wenxian County by this Newspaper】In Beizhang @, Wenxian County, forty activists from among the poor peasants and utterly impoverished laborers who returned from training in the district on "July 7th" immediately convened a village-wide mass meeting that evening to discuss achieving liberation and prepare to launch struggles against the landlords and local bullies Li Shanjiao, Li Wenyi, Liu Shixian, and seven other families. At the meeting, everyone believed that "liberation cannot rely on one person"; "unity is essential, but without a leader, it won't work." Under the conscious demand of the masses, the "Peasants' Turn-Over-for-Liberation One-Heart Association" was established. Zheng Liu, an over-sixty-year-old woman from Erdao Street, leaning on her crutch, walked three steps in one to the front of the stage and said, "This is our poor people's world. I want liberation. I'm over sixty, and I hope that with the Communist Party coming, I can still enjoy happiness. I am an old poor person; quickly put my name on the list." The old woman happily clapped her hands together with difficulty, tears of joy streaming from her eyes. Eighteen people immediately signed up, and the old utterly impoverished peasants Yang Shuan and Li Zhenhua were elected as chairman and vice-chairman, as well as the village chief and vice-chief. It was already past midnight. Chairman Yang Shuan burned incense and knelt in the spacious courtyard, vowing to heaven. Seeing that the chairman sincerely led the poor people in achieving liberation, everyone knelt down in the courtyard, vowing to heaven: "If I have any wavering intentions, may heaven not tolerate me, may I be struck by lightning!" The bright moonlight hung in the sky, the wind blew the leaves, rustling like applause, wishing them a smooth and successful liberation. Everyone immediately responded, "We are not afraid of disunity now; we are all one family under the leadership of Chairman Mao!" Everyone shouted long live liberation! Long live the poor people ruling the world! Long live Chairman Mao and the Communist Party! By the time the meeting adjourned, the roosters were already crowing. (Ying Jun)
