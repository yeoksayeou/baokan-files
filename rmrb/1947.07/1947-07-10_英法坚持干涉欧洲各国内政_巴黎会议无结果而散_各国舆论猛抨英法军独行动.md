Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 5th. Comprehensive reports: The Paris Three Foreign Ministers Conference, which discussed the Marshall Plan, was held five times from the 27th of last month to the 2nd of this month. Finally, due to Britain and France's insistence on their empty "European Economic Recovery Plan" that interfered with the economies and sovereign independence of European countries, it differed in opinion from the Soviet Union. The meeting closed without result on the 2nd. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov flew back to Moscow on the 3rd. It is reported that Bevin and Bidault held separate meetings after Molotov left France, and decided that Britain and France would jointly invite 22 European countries other than the Soviet Union to hold a so-called "European Conference" in Paris on July 12 to discuss the "European Economic Recovery Plan."

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th. Comprehensive reports: After the Paris Three Foreign Ministers Conference ended without result, a TASS Paris reporter reported on the 5th that the independent actions of the British and French governments have been fiercely criticized by democrats; public opinion in various countries has commented on them. On the 4th, the "Práce," the central organ of the Czechoslovak Trade Union, published an editorial stating: "The reason for the failure of the Paris Conference is that the United States is using the pretext of economic assistance to Europe as a smokescreen to try to implement Churchill's European Federation plan." It also pointed out: The French plan to establish a special European organization only means interfering in the internal affairs of European countries. "Právo" also pointed out that Bevin and Bidault's separate invitation to European countries to participate in the European Conference is a plan to establish a Western European economic group. "Právo Lidů" and some French newspapers believe that Bevin and Bidault's current policies are reminiscent of the Munich Conference. On the same day, the Norwegian "Bergens Tidende" stated that the Western powers will force small countries to sacrifice their economic independence for economic recovery. Recently, there have been reports that the United States and Britain oppose Norway's construction of steel factories, and the construction of aluminum factories in Årdal has also encountered the same obstruction. If "aid" is obtained at the expense of independence, then for Norway, the price paid would be too high. On the 3rd, Swiss officials believed that the rumor that Switzerland had been invited to participate in the European Conference was only an estimate made by foreigners. People close to the Swiss government also said: "Our inviolable policy of sovereign integrity must remain the guiding factor in all international negotiations, and must not be compromised."

　　英法坚持干涉欧洲各国内政
  　巴黎会议无结果而散
    各国舆论猛抨英法军独行动
    【新华社陕北五日电】综合报导：讨论马歇尔计划之巴黎三外长会议，自上月廿七日至本月二日止，共举行会议五次，终于因英法固执其干涉欧洲各国经济与主权独立之空泛的“欧洲经济复兴计划”而与苏联意见相左，会议已于二日无结果闭幕。苏外长莫洛托夫三日已飞返莫斯科。文与处道关于莫氏离法后曾单独进行会议，并决定由英法联名请苏联以外欧洲二十二国于七月十二日在巴黎举行所谓“欧洲会议”，以讨论“欧洲经济复兴计划”。
    【新华社陕北六日电】综合报导：巴黎三外长会议无结果而散以后，塔斯社巴黎记者五日报导谓：英法政府的单独行动，已为民主人士猛烈抨击；各国舆论纷予评论。四日，捷克职工会中央机关报“普拉斯”刊载专论称：“巴黎会议之所以失败，乃由于美国借对欧经济援助的字眼，作为企图实行邱吉尔欧洲联邦计划的烟幕。”并指出：法国计划建立欧洲的特殊组织，只是意味着干涉欧洲各国的内政而已。普拉沃报亦指出：贝文与皮道尔单独邀请欧洲各国参加欧洲会议之举，就是建立西欧经济集团的计划。普拉沃·里都报与一些法国报纸都认为贝文与皮道尔今日之政策，使人回想起慕尼黑会议。同日，挪威柏尔杜斯扬报称：西方诸强国将迫使各小国因经济复原而牺牲其经济独立。最近已有美英反对挪威建修钢铁工厂的消息，在奥达尔修建铝工厂，亦遭到同样的阻挠。如果牺牲独立得来“援助”，那对挪威来说，付的代价就太大了。三日瑞士官方人士认为，外传瑞士已应邀参加欧洲会议一事，只是外国人士所作的估计。接近瑞政府的人士也说：“我们不可侵害的主权完整政策，必须仍是一切国际交涉的指导因素，而且不容危害。”
