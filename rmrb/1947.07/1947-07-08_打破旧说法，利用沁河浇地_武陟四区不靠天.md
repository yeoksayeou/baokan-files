Breaking Old Sayings, Using the Qin River for Irrigation
　　The Fourth District of Wuzhi Doesn't Rely on Heaven

　　[This newspaper Wuzhi news] Under the general task of mobilizing the masses to oppose exploitation and develop guerrilla warfare, Wuzhi calls on the masses in all districts and villages of the county to immediately rise up to fight drought and overcome famine, dig wells and canals, and irrigate the land for planting. Encouraged by saving food to overcome disaster and rushing to plant and replant to support the great counter-offensive, Nanwang, Beiwang, Taocun, Xiaodong and other villages in the Fourth District dug four canals and opened four sluice gates at the end of June. Each sluice gate irrigated an average of 250 mu of land per day, totaling 7,000 mu of land planted in seven days. After Nanwang and Beiwang completed their grain storage tasks, they successively held mass meetings. They called on everyone that although the weather is dry, we cannot fail to plant crops because we have the Qin River water. We should immediately organize to dig canals and wells, open sluice gates to irrigate the land for planting, save food and use it sparingly to overcome the disaster and support the counter-offensive. At the meeting, Gu Zhicheng said: "We cannot sit and wait for rain. If we open the sluice gate in Nanwang, we can irrigate not only the land in the north and south villages, but also the land in Gangtou, Mozhuang, and Gengcun. This sluice gate can irrigate more than 10,000 mu of land." Finally, everyone unanimously agreed to open the sluice gate and immediately organized all the male and female labor in the village and all 37 livestock, selected dedicated personnel to be responsible, unified the use of human and animal power, and repaid debts with labor; planting seeds in ditches (planting seeds in the soil-covered trenches); digging two canals, planting and irrigating at the same time; in just seven days, 1,000 mu were planted. Now the seedlings have grown more than a finger high, and the masses are very happy to see it, saying: "The people are of one mind, and everything can be overcome. Waiting for rain delays major events, it is better to act early." At the mass mobilization meeting in Beiwang Village, it was discovered that the masses were paralyzed and had a fluke mentality. The masses said: "Let's wait and see! Will it not rain? Using the Qin River to irrigate the land will produce alkali and damage the land!" Some said: "Our village has few people, no one can do it, and we can succeed if we buy a few more windlasses and waterwheels." After the cadres understood the masses' thoughts, they discussed the issue of opening the sluice gate in groups, and recalled the past when they fled the famine, supporting the old and leading the young, enduring hunger and eating raw sweet potato seedlings, grass seeds, and fine white soil, etc., resulting in difficult bowel movements. After reflection, everyone's thinking was finally unified, and everyone said: "If we save a little every day, we can make the fine water flow long, and not let the river water break. We must save at the mouth of the jar, not at the bottom of the jar." When the canal opening plan was set, 1,800 zhang of canal were dug in five days, and the land was irrigated and planted at the same time. As a result, everyone was in high spirits and worked quickly, completing the task in four days. Now 1,200 mu have been planted. Gengcun has planted 600 mu.

　　Under the influence of the irrigation and planting in Nanwang and Beiwang villages, Xiaodong and Taocun have opened sluice gates for irrigation and planting. Mozhuang Liu was organized in the mass movement to dig canals and plant crops. In the Fourth District, waterwheels and windlasses are used to irrigate the land for planting. According to preliminary statistics, approximately 23,000 mu of land have been planted. (Miao Runtian)

　　打破旧说法，利用沁河浇地
  　武陟四区不靠天
    【本报武陟讯】在发动群众反倒算与开展游击战争的总任务下，武陟号召全县各区村群众立即起来抗旱渡荒，打井挑渠，浇地下种。在省吃俭用渡灾荒，抢种抢补支援大反攻的鼓舞下，四区南王、北王、陶村、小东等村于六月底挑渠开闸四道，每道闸每天平均浇地二五○亩，共计七天浇地下种七千亩。南王、北王完成囤粮任务后，先后召开了群众大会。号召大家，天虽旱，咱靠着沁河水不能不下种，应立即组织起来挑渠挖井，开闸浇地下种，少吃俭用渡过灾荒支援反攻，在会上谷志成说：“咱们不能坐着等雨，咱们南王开闸，不但能浇了南北两村地，而且能浇了岗头、磨庄、耿村地，这道闸能浇到一万余亩地。”最后大家都一致同意开闸，立即将全村男女劳力和全村三十七头牲口均组织起来，选出了专人负责，人畜力统一使用，欠工以工还工，牲口出料；冲沟点种会（地裹耕下沟点上种籽）；挑渠两道，连种带浇；仅仅七天，下种一○○○亩。现在青苗长出了一指多高，群众看见非常喜欢，说：“老百姓成一心，啥也能战胜，等雨误大事，不如早动手。”北王村在群众动员会上，发现群众麻痹与侥幸心理，群众说：“靠靠吧！天会不下雨？用沁河浇地，出碱坏地哩！”有的说：“咱村人少，没人干，多买几个辘辘和水车就能成。”干部了解群众思想后，即分组讨论开闸问题，并回忆了过去扶老牵幼逃荒，忍饥挨饿，在村群众吃生红薯秧、草籽、细白土等，吃上大便不利。经过检讨终于打通了大家思想，大家说：“过日月减省点，能叫细水长流，不叫江水断了，要在缸口省，不要到缸底省。”当定出了开渠计划，五天挑好渠一千八百丈，随浇随种，结果由于大家情绪高做活快，四天就完成了，现在下种一千二百亩。耿村下种六百亩。
    在南王北王两村浇地下种影响下，小东陶村已开闸浇地下种。磨庄刘，在群运中组织起来，开渠下种。四区开闸用水车和辘辘浇地下种，据初步统计，约有二万三千亩土地下了种。（苗润田）
