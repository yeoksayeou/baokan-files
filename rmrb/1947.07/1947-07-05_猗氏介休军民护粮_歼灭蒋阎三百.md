　　[Taiyue, This Report, 3rd] The armymen and civilians of Yi Shi launched a struggle to protect grain. The Independent Battalion achieved a great victory, annihilating one enemy company and one squad in two days. In recent days, Ma Kuibang's troops, the pseudo county magistrate of Yi Shi who sneaked into Yuncheng, have been constantly harassing the villages of Dongxi Renli in Yi Shi, robbing grain and extorting money. In order to protect the interests of the masses, our Yi Shi Independent Battalion launched a counter-grabbing grain and counter-conscription offensive. On the 17th, a unit of the battalion ambushed the enemy in Renli Village, south of the county, annihilating one squad, capturing six die-hards, and seizing one machine gun and five rifles. On the 22nd, they ambushed the pseudo 12th Special Commissioner's Office's Political Security Battalion, which was harassing from Yuncheng, in Zhangsong Village, south of the county, annihilating one company, seizing three machine guns, 25 rifles, one grenade launcher, and more than 2,000 rounds of ammunition.
    [Taiyue, This Report, 3rd] The armymen and civilians of Jiexiu launched a struggle to protect grain, and are currently engaged in a tit-for-tat and fierce battle with the enemy. The enemy's grain-grabbing deployment has been smashed by us. From June 5th to 26th, nearly 200 enemies were annihilated, and two small cannons and 65 rifles were seized. Yan’s army forced the masses near the strongholds to hand over two dan and two dou and five sheng of rice for every two liang of silver, and also levied heavily under the names of "substitute grain purchase," "requisition grain purchase," and "village grain allocation." Yan's pseudo county magistrate personally led his subordinates to forcibly establish strongholds in Jingsheng, Hehe, Zhongjie, and Dongshan, and drove the masses to rob grain and arrest young people in large numbers. Our county headquarters mobilized combat heroes and militiamen throughout the county to launch fierce attacks on the enemy. At the conference of 6,000 people in the first and second districts, the heroes pledged to eliminate the enemy and complete the protection of grain. Zhang Ximan, leading the liberated people in the first district, annihilated a part of the enemy in Beiliang Village, killing and capturing 12 enemies, and seizing one rifle and one small cannon. The hero Luo Laifu planted mines under the enemy's wall in Gaojiabao, killing nine enemies. In the joint defense operations, the militiamen in the second district killed 13 enemies, and the Longfeng militiamen annihilated more than 20 enemies, seizing one small cannon and three rifles. On the 26th, the militia rotation team and the armed work team of the Shitai District intercepted more than 100 members of the Yan army's security police brigade and local reactionaries who came from Zhanglan, with only a dozen people escaping, and seized 60 rifles, creating a model battle for the militia to annihilate a large number of enemies.
