    Increase Production Through Competition! Coordinate with the Counteroffensive!
    The No. 1 Military Supply Clothing Factory Takes the Lead in Launching a Major Competition

    [Our Newspaper] Upon hearing the news that our frontline troops had crossed the Yellow River and were advancing into the KMT-controlled areas, all the workers and staff of the No. 1 Military Supply Clothing Factory enthusiastically proposed: "Coordinate with the frontline's major counteroffensive and launch a major production increase competition!" The cutting group took the lead by stepping onto the 'battlefield' and announcing the competition conditions: increasing output without delaying machine work, saving materials, and maintaining quality according to regulations. They then challenged the dyeing workshop. The dyeing workshop followed by proposing the conditions: "Consistent color, flattened and neatly folded, dye as much as is cut, without delaying use" to respond to the challenge. Subsequently, the machine groups, with a spirit of brave charge, mutually proposed production increase competition conditions. Doctors, repair teams, and blacksmiths for cutting shears were all swept into the wave of competition. After the competition was launched, Comrade Shi Guangrong increased his output of cotton military uniforms from 100 sets to 120 sets per day. Shen Tianwang, the cutting group leader, did not rest at noon, inspecting the cutting quality of comrades in the group to ensure quality while increasing production. Comrade Lian Jinfu of the machine group inspected each garment while sewing, determined to "sew well first, then sew fast." Wang Tucheng, the fifth group leader, said: "We lost the single-layer clothing task competition to the fourth group; this time, we must work harder and win back the cotton clothing competition." Model group leader Zhao Jiangzhu told the comrades in his group: "If another group wins the championship flag in this competition, our group will not be glorious." Currently, the enthusiasm for intense work fills the entire factory. (Ge Qin)

    [Our Newspaper, Shahe News] To commemorate the Party's birthday and coordinate with the major counteroffensive, the Dazhong Coal Mine decided to reduce capital, increase production, and streamline redundant personnel, which was unanimously supported by the workers. Comrades Mao Ting and Wang Yunhe said: "To commemorate the Party's birthday and defeat Chiang Kai-shek, we must achieve results, and partial interests must be subordinated to the overall interests." He also said: "We must sweat more and work harder. Saying is not enough." The workers replied: "Right! Work hard!"

    Workers at the Zhangcun New Mine also proposed: "We, working in the mine, must do the work of two people."

    Outsourcing workers said: "For the sake of the major counteroffensive, I have no objection to temporarily switching to agricultural production." When they left, they said: "If the miners get busy, we'll come back." (Rong Jinlin)

    【本报沙河讯】大众煤矿为纪念党的生日配合大反攻，决定减资增产精简多余的人员，工友们个个赞成。毛廷同志、王运和同志说：“为纪念党的生日，打败蒋介石，定要作出成绩来，必须部分利益服从整个利益”。他又说：“还得多流汗，加劲干哩，光说不算”。工友们答：“对！努力干！”
    章村新矿工人又提出：“咱在矿上，一个要顶两个干。”
    外工说：“为了大反攻，我暂时转为农业生产，我没意见”。他们走的时候说：“矿工如忙了，我们还来哩。”（荣金林）
