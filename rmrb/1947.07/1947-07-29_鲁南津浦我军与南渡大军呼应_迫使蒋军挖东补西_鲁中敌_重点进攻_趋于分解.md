　　Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 27th—Our front-line reporter reports on the war situation in East China in recent months: Chiang Kai-shek's army's "key offensive" against the Yi-Lu Mountain area has become an arrow at the end of its flight. Since June 25, Chiang's army has concentrated nine reorganized divisions on the Laiwu-Mengyin line in central Shandong, attempting to find the main force of the East China Liberation Army for a decisive battle. After a part of the Liberation Army carried out a series of blocking actions, Chiang's army suffered heavy losses. According to statistics for the thirteen days from June 26 to the 8th of this month alone, Chiang's army suffered as many as 4,200 casualties. (Those annihilated by the militia and local armed forces are not included in the calculation.) Chiang's army was held up on the Yishui Donglidian line. The rear supply line of Chiang's army has been paralyzed under the sabotage and blockade of the vast militia and local armed forces in the liberated areas. The supply of hundreds of thousands of Chiang's troops depends on air transport, and the supply of food and ammunition is insufficient, making it difficult to advance or retreat. The Liberation Army guarding troops, which are entrenched in the hinterland of Chiang's army, constantly strike at Chiang's army. During this period, another part of the Liberation Army moved to the flanks and rear of Chiang's army, and on the 7th, captured Feixian City, the center of southern Shandong, annihilating one reorganized brigade and one reorganized regiment of Chiang's army. Taking advantage of the victory, on the 9th, they captured many important places such as Zaozhuang and Yixian County, liberating a vast area of 300 li in length and breadth. Then, with a commanding position, they attacked the Xuzhou-Ziyang section of the Jinpu Railway. Another part of the Liberation Army annihilated an enemy battalion and recovered Tai'an on the 8th, and then took advantage of the victory to capture Dawenkou, an important town on the Jinpu Railway, on the evening of the 10th, annihilating more than 600 Chiang's troops and puppet soldiers. On the evening of the 13th, they once again recovered Ningyang City on the west side of the Jinpu Railway, and cooperated with the local corps to sweep across the Chiang's army west of the Jinpu Railway, successively capturing cities such as Fei, Dongping, Dong'a, and Pingyin. The above-mentioned two armies have coordinated with the troops of General Liu Bocheng, who crossed the Yellow River to the south, forcing Chiang's army to transfer troops from central Shandong to rescue the western front, and the so-called "key offensive" originally intended to concentrate the main force to attack eastward tends to decompose.

　　鲁南津浦我军与南渡大军呼应
  　迫使蒋军挖东补西
  　鲁中敌“重点进攻”趋于分解
    【新华社华东前线二十七日电】本社前线记者报导华东近月战局：蒋军对沂鲁山区之“重点进攻”，已成强弩之末，自六月二十五日起，蒋军在鲁中莱芜至蒙阴一线即集中了九个整编师的兵力，齐头东犯，妄图找寻华东解放军主力进行决战。经解放军一部予以节节阻击，蒋军损失惨重，仅六月廿六日至本月八日十三天统计，蒋军被杀伤者即达四千二百余人。（被歼于民兵与地方武装者，尚未计算在内），将蒋军滞阻于沂水东里店一线。而蒋军后方补给线，在解放区广大民兵、地方武装之破袭封锁下，已成瘫痪状态，数十万蒋军之补给，仰赖空运，粮弹不济，进退维谷。而雄踞蒋军腹地之解放军守岗部队，则不时予蒋军以打击。在此期间，解放军另部转至蒋军侧背，于七日一举攻克鲁南中心之费县城，歼蒋军一个整旅及一个整团，复乘胜于九日连克枣庄、峄县等要地多处，解放纵横三百里之广大地区后，以居高临下之势，出击津浦路徐（州）滋（阳）段。解放军又一部，则于八日歼敌一营收复泰安后，乘胜于十日晚攻克津浦路重镇压大汶口，歼蒋伪六百余。十三日晚再度收复津浦路西侧之宁阳城，并配合地方兵团横扫津浦路西蒋军，连克肥、东平、东阿、平阴等城。上述两路大军，已与南渡黄河之刘伯承将军所部互相呼应，迫使蒋军不得不由鲁中抽调兵力救援西线，而原定集中主力东犯的所谓“重点攻势”乃趋于分解。
