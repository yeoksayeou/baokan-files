　　Greek Communist Party Secretary Publishes Paper
  　Hinting at Establishing Democratic Regime in Liberated Areas
    [Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th] Athens Dispatch: The "Risospathis" newspaper published an essay by Zachariadis, Secretary of the Greek Communist Party, stating: "Today, two important factors determine the political life of Greece: one is the interference of the US and Britain supporting the royalist fascists; the other is the people's struggle for national independence, democracy, welfare, and against foreign enslavement. The outcome of the struggle between these two factors will determine whether Greece will be a free country or a slave market. Because the issue concerns the vital interests of the country, democrats must truly shed their responsibility for the Greek situation, and their responsibility to the royalist fascist reactionaries and the so-called central government. This division of responsibility can only be expressed by establishing a new democratic government in the free democratic areas within the country." This essay has received widespread commentary among Greek political figures, and is considered by many to be a final warning to the royalist camp.

　　希共书记发表论文
  　暗示将在解放区建立民主政权
    【新华社陕北十八日电】雅典讯：“日萨斯皮斯提斯”报发表希共书记查沙雅狄斯之论文称：“今日决定希腊政治生活的两个重要的因素：一个是支持保皇法西斯分子的美英的干涉；一个是人民为国家独立、民主、福利与反对外国奴役的斗争。这两因素斗争之结果，将决定希腊或为一自由国家或为一奴隶市场。由于问题关系着国家的重大利益，民主人士必须真正卸却他们对希腊局势的责任，卸却对保皇法西斯反动派与所谓中央政府的责任。这一责任的划分，只有在国内的自由民主区域建立新的民主政府才能表示出来。”此篇论文在希腊政界人士中受到广泛的评论，而且被很多人认为是对石冀阵容的最后警告。
