　　Great Contribution to Heavy Industry in the Border Region
  　Comrade Yin Yiqing Discovers Gray Pig Iron
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 27th dispatch] Comrade Yin Yiqing's discovery of gray pig iron is a great contribution to the heavy industry of our region. Comrade Yin Yiqing is the Deputy Manager of the Jintai Iron Industry Company in Jincheng. Before the war, he worked in Yan Xishan's Taiyuan Arsenal, where he suffered much exploitation. Since joining the Jintai Company, he has frequently inspected iron mines in various places and deeply felt that the indigenous methods of mining yielded little product but required much effort. Therefore, he painstakingly researched and improved the methods. His discovery of gray pig iron occurred at an iron mine in Zhaozhuang, Jincheng. After the iron was melted, the molten juice was too thin to be easily cast. Even if it was cast, the sound was different from other iron and it was difficult to sell. Therefore, no one had mined it for many years. Comrade Yin Yiqing personally went to the village and painstakingly studied it. After dozens of experiments, he proved that it was gray pig iron for manufacturing machines and bullets. He brought the results of his experiments to Changzhi to be reviewed by experts, and it was finally determined to be undoubtedly so. The discovery of this type of iron ore is a major contribution to the military industrial raw materials of the Liberated Areas. The Administrative Office here awarded him a special-class medal on the 15th of this month to encourage him to continue his dedication to the industrial construction of our region.

　　边区重工业上的伟大贡献
  　阴义卿同志发现灰生铁
    【本报太岳二十七日电】阴义卿同志发现灰生铁，为本区重工业上之伟大贡献。阴义卿同志系晋城晋泰铁业公司之副经理，战前曾在阎锡山的太原兵工厂作工，饱受压榨，自到晋泰公司后，经常视察各地铁矿，深觉土法开采出品少费力多，于是悉心研究改进方法。其灰生铁的发现，是在晋城赵庄有一铁矿，铁溶化后溶汁太稀不易铸造，即便铸成，声音也和别的铁不同难以出售，所以多年无人开采，阴义卿同志便亲赴该庄苦心钻研，经数十次之试验，证明是制造机器与枪弹的灰生铁，并将其试验结果带至长治请专家审查，最后确定无疑。此种铁矿之发现对解放区军工原料是一大贡献，此间行署于本月十五特授予特等奖章鼓励其继续致力于本区之工业建设。
