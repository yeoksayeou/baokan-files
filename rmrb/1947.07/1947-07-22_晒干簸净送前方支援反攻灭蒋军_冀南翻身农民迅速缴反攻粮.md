[Report from this newspaper in Southern Hebei, 19th] Liberated peasants in various areas are enthusiastically handing over requisitioned grain for the counteroffensive. The grain is full and plump, and the delivery is smooth and swift. In the seventh district of Linqing, in villages such as Tianzhuang, Jiangzhuang, Yanzhuang, Zhongzhuang, and Baizhuang, many people, as soon as the new wheat was swept up on the threshing floor, first bagged up the wheat at the upwind end, preparing it for requisitioned grain. They said, "The best wheat must be given to the front lines first. The front lines are shedding blood and risking their lives for our liberation!" The grain delivered in all areas is sieved, winnowed, tossed, and dried, so it is all plump and free of chaff and dirt. Dong Quan, of the Qi Zhi Third Great Lian Village, seeing that his dried wheat still had some husks, ran it over the millstone once before handing it in. Sister-in-law Li of Lizhuang in Guantao district said, "I really can't bring myself to hand in bad wheat. Handing in good wheat is for the great counteroffensive to defeat Old Chiang!" Yang Zhendong of Daming Chengguan said, "Handing in good wheat this year shows that we have the Eighth Route Army in our hearts!" In Nanliucun, Qiuxian County, the day for handing in requisitioned grain was set, but it drizzled a little. Dong Xizhong quickly took out several mats to cover the grain, saying that if the wheat got wet, it would rot, and it would be terrible if the front lines ate rotten wheat." The speed with which grain is handed in everywhere is even more astonishing. For example, the entire county of Linqing completed it in two days. The second district of Qiuxian completely delivered the grain into the granary in two days. In Nanliucun, the first district of Qiuxian, grain was handed in by groups, and the entire village completed the task in just one hour. Zheng Chengxian of Daxiecun in the fifth district of Yuanchao said while drying wheat, "When I hand in wheat this year, I must tear off the first voucher. If I tear off the second, then I will have let down the Communist Party!" Wang Jinjie of Chanzhuang in the seventh district of Linqing carried a large cloth bag of wheat and said to everyone, "My son, Zhensheng, is fighting Old Chiang on the front lines. If he eats the wheat I handed in, he will know that I, his father, am working hard in the rear to also fight Old Chiang." Liu Qingyu, a disabled veteran of the village, said, "I am disabled and haven't produced much grain since returning home. I will also... hand in requisitioned grain, so that the comrades on the front lines know how sad I, a disabled person, am that I can't fight Old Chiang. As long as I don't die, I must do my best to fight Old Chiang!"

[Report from Taiyue, 19th] Hundreds of thousands of liberated peasants in the liberated counties of Huoxian and Zhaocheng, along the Tongpu Railway line, are enthusiastically handing over requisitioned grain for the counteroffensive. After the peasants of Dongdong Village in the second district of Zhaocheng received news of the victory and the start of the counteroffensive, they said, "We have liberated ourselves, so we must quickly hand in requisitioned grain to liberate others!" Every family is vying to hand in requisitioned grain, faster than ever before. In just one and a half days, the entire village's requisitioned grain was completely handed in. The grain delivered was clean and of sufficient weight. After completing the task, the entire village formed a large grain transport team of thirteen carts, men, women, militiamen, and children, numbering over one hundred and ninety people, to deliver the grain. Comrade Wang Yushuo of the district farmers' association carried four dou despite being ill, and female cadre Lin Quannv also carried two dou. Even four women left their children with neighbors and volunteered to carry grain. The sixty-two-year-old woman, Secretary Jiu, of Xidong Village, and her daughter-in-law competed to deliver grain and carry grain. Others tried to dissuade her, saying, "It's enough for your daughter-in-law to go!" She said, "My daughter-in-law is carrying her share, and I am carrying my share!" Xizhang Village in Huoxian organized itself and delivered the requisitioned grain within five days. Old men and those with weak bodies were also unwilling to lag behind, driving carts to transport it. More than sixty women in Liye Village formed a grain transport brigade, first carrying the grain to the foot of the mountain, where men then transferred it up the mountain. Women in Yuli Village, led by heroines Wang Ling'e and Bo Guihua, organized a grain transport reception station to receive grain transport teams coming and going from various districts. Village Vice Wife did not participate because she had a child, but she volunteered fifty catties of firewood, saying, "We must do private work and public work, and supporting the counteroffensive is the most important thing."
