　　Auspicious Rain in Jiaozuo
  　Seizing the Time to Complete Planting Amidst War
    [Report from Jiaozuo by this newspaper] On the evening of July 2nd, Jiaozuo experienced widespread rainfall. The leadership grasped the opportunity and fully organized a crash summer planting campaign, even suspending the Hero Representatives Conference originally scheduled for the 6th. The municipal government immediately issued a notice to cease all non-combat related civilian labor payments. Troops and office personnel went to the fields to help the masses with the crash planting. From the 3rd to the 7th, despite the Qinbo Campaign and the coordinated attacks by the city's northern district cadre teams and militia, the planting was not delayed. While a certain unit was engaged in battle at Nan Temple Ridge, the masses were steadily carrying out crash planting at the foot of the mountain. According to statistics from seventeen villages in two districts, 3,520.09 mu have been planted, averaging 555.6 mu per day. There are still 462 mu remaining, which are estimated to be completely planted in one day. (Lianqun)
    [Report from Lucheng by this newspaper] On the night of the 11th, the second district of this county received rainfall. Village cadres immediately went deep among the masses to mobilize them, proposing that "an inch of rain is as precious as oil" and "planting even one seedling is better than leaving the land empty," dispelling the masses' pessimistic attitude of waiting for thorough rain before replanting. This sparked a replanting and returning to wheat stubble campaign, achieving significant results. According to statistics from fourteen villages including Lijiazhuang, a total of 2,431 mu of autumn land and 3,656 mu of returned wheat stubble land were replanted in two days.

　　焦作喜雨
  　战争间隙完成抢种
    【本报焦作讯】七月二日晚，焦作普遍落雨，领导上抓紧，全力组织突击夏种，把准备六号召开的群英大会也停开了。市政府则立即通告停止一切非战斗的民力支付。部队机关人员纷纷上地帮助群众突击下种。三号至七号，五天中，虽有沁博战役、市北区干队、民兵队的配合出击，仍不误下种，某部在南寺岭进行着战斗时，群众仍稳稳地在山下突击抢种。据两个区十七个村统计，已下种有三千五百二十亩零九分，平均每天下种五百五十五亩六分地。还有四百六十二亩，估计需要一天时间就可以彻底完成下种。（联群）
    【本报潞城讯】本县二区十一日夜落雨，该村干部即深入发动群众，提出“寸雨贵似油”，“种出一棵算一棵，总比空地强的多”，打通了群众消极等下透雨才补种的思想，掀起补种回茬运动，并得到很大成绩。现据李家庄等十四个村统计，两天共补秋地二千四百三十一亩，回茬麦地三千六百五十六亩。（潞城联合内公室）
