Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: The infiltration of US imperialist forces into Sweden and the Netherlands has aroused strong opposition from public opinion in both countries. According to a Stockholm dispatch: Recently, the United States forced Sweden to sign an unequal US-Swedish trade agreement, canceling the Swedish import controls established on March 12 of this year to counter the dumping of American goods. The Swedish newspapers strongly criticized this act of the United States infringing upon Swedish sovereignty and expressed indignation at the government's obedience to foreign demands and its inability to independently control imports.

According to a dispatch from The Hague: Newspapers in The Hague strongly condemned the arrival of Eric Johnston, a well-known American film industry mogul, in the Netherlands. Ulander and Groep reported: "The United States is exerting political and economic pressure on the Dutch authorities to force Dutch cinemas to exclude films from other countries and permanently show American films. The United States is attempting to destroy the spiritual freedom of the Dutch people." The newspaper, *Waarheid*, stated: "This intention of Hollywood has become a new threat to Dutch independence."

    美国势力侵入瑞荷
    两国舆论猛力反对
    【新华社陕北九日电】美帝国主义势力对瑞典、荷兰两国之侵入，已引起该两国舆论之猛力反对。据斯托哥尔姆讯：最近美强迫瑞典订立美瑞不平等贸易协定，取消瑞方于本年三月十二日为对抗美货倾销而建立的进口管制，瑞典各报对美国此一侵犯瑞典主权之举，力予抨击；并对政府听命外人要求、而不能独立管制进口事，咸表愤慨。
    另据海牙讯：海牙报纸对美著名电影业巨子埃立夫·约翰斯敦抵达荷兰力予谴责。乌兰德、格罗朴报称：“美国正以政治经济压力加诸荷兰当局强迫荷兰电影院排除他国电影而永远放映美国电影，美国正图破坏荷兰人精神上之自由。”瓦尔海德报称：“好莱坞此项意图，已成为对荷兰独立之新威胁。”
