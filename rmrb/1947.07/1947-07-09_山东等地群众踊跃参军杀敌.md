    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 3rd. Ma Chengan, a student from Mizhi Middle School, and twenty other people, recently collectively joined the Northwest People's Liberation Army in a certain place. Before joining the army, they took care of the wounded in the rear hospitals. They excitedly told reporters, "We are the children of the border area people, and we are the younger generation nurtured and raised by Chairman Mao. The revolution educates us with knowledge, and we must use knowledge to serve the people of the border area. Now our only hope is to quickly reach the front line to kill the enemy and make meritorious service for the people." Before their departure, they asked reporters to convey their friendly concern to the students in the KMT-controlled areas who are persisting in opposing hunger and civil war.
