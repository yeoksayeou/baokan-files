    The Glorious Victory of the Local Military Corps

    The Taiyue Third Military Sub-district’s local military corps ambushed the enemy's entire 83rd Brigade of the 10th Division, returning from Pinglu to Yuncheng, at Miaodi Village north of Pinglu on the 12th of this month. After the enemy entered the ambush, they were completely annihilated. Apart from more than a hundred killed or wounded, the entire force of 1,400+ men including the regimental commander and three battalion commanders were captured without exception. Our army suffered only thirty casualties.

    This exemplary battle created a new record for local military corps annihilating an entire regiment of the Nationalist army, proving that under the guidance of Chairman Mao's military thought, and after a year of training in the Patriotic Self-Defense War, our local military corps can not only fight annihilation battles, but also annihilate an entire regular regiment of the Chiang army at one time. It proves that our local military corps have generally improved in combat art and technical skills. This battle demonstrated the following characteristics: skillful in grasping the enemy's situation, selecting terrain, and seizing opportunities; skillful in organizing combat with concealed and rapid movement, giving the enemy a sudden and annihilating blow. Most worthy of praise is that our army's casualties were particularly small, averaging one casualty for every fifty enemies.

    This battle pointed out a clear direction for all local troops, requiring our local troops not only to learn guerrilla warfare, but also to further learn to appropriately concentrate superior forces, find the enemy's weaknesses, fight annihilation battles, and strive to annihilate a platoon, a company, or even a battalion at a time. This is achievable and must be achieved. Everyone should learn from the local military corps of the Taiyue Third Military Sub-district.

    We salute the local military corps of the Taiyue Third Military Sub-district, and salute the heroes of the Miaodi Village battle! We call on the local military corps of the entire region to strive to create more Miaodi battles!

    地方兵团的光辉战例
    太岳三分区地方兵团，本月十二日设伏于平陆以北的庙底村，由平陆返回运城之敌整十师八十三旅一个整团，于进入伏击圈后，即为我全部消灭，除毙伤百余人外，团长及三个营长以下一千四百余人全数就擒，无一幸免，我军仅伤亡三十人。
    这一模范战斗，创造了地方兵团歼敌正规军一个整团的新纪录，证明在毛主席军事思想的指导之下，经过了一年来爱国自卫战争的锻炼，我们的地方兵团不仅可以打歼灭战，而且可以一次歼灭蒋军的一个正规团；证明我地方兵团在战斗艺术与技术素养方面都有了普遍的提高。这一战斗中即表现了以下特点：善于掌握敌情，选择地形，捕捉战机；善于组织战斗以荫蔽迅速的动性，予敌人以突然的歼灭打击。最值得表扬的是我军伤亡特别小，平均我以一个人的伤亡换取敌人五十人。
    这一战斗为所有地方部队指出了明确的方向，要求我们地方部队不仅要学会游击战争，更要进一步学会适当集中优势兵力，寻找敌人弱点，打歼灭战，争取一次歼敌一个排、一个连、乃在一个营，这是可以作到的，而且必须作到。大家要向太岳三分区地方兵团学习。
    我们向太岳三分区的地方兵团致敬，向平陆庙底村战斗的英雄们致敬，我们号召全区地方兵团为创造更多的庙底战斗而奋斗！
