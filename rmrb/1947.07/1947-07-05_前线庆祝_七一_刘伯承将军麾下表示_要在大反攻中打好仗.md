  　to Fight Well in the Great Counter-Offensive
    [This newspaper's Yubei Frontline Dispatch, 2nd] Yesterday, the field army under the command of General Liu Bocheng enthusiastically celebrated the "July 1st" Festival in the war zone. From their own practical experience, all commanders and fighters of this ever-victorious army recalled and deeply felt the correctness of the leadership of the Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. Soldiers of the "Wujiang" unit, in the "finding good" heart-to-heart talk movement, sought out the goodness of the Communist Party and the goodness of Chairman Mao, recognizing from personal experience the inseparable bond between themselves and the Communist Party. The entire field army resolutely expressed that they would respond to the Party's call in the counter-offensive and complete the three major tasks: (1) Fight well. (2) Mobilize the masses. (3) Resolutely implement financial and economic policies.
