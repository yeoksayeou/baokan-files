Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Sui, 21st: The Jin-Sui Military Region Political Department work team, while working in Liangcheng, gained a new experience in military construction: "Poor peasant and farm laborer soldiers as the backbone are the foundation of all work in the troops." After the team went deep into the company, it focused on investigating two questions: (1) The different attitudes and performances of commanders and fighters, regardless of their class background and origin, towards various tasks in the army, as well as towards land reform, family, and combat. (2) The specific situations of activists and backward elements. The results revealed that soldiers of poor peasant and farm laborer origin had firm positions in their words and in all kinds of work, but most of them were not good at speaking and appeared honest and simple, as if they were not smart. They had no status in the army and were often regarded as middle-of-the-roaders. On the other hand, those who were eloquent and appeared "smart" were often elements with impure class backgrounds, but they were valued and promoted. As a result, some so-called heroes, models, cadres, and party members in the past ended up collapsing and degenerating. At the same time, in the past, some people believed that most of those who deserted were from poor families lacking labor, but the fact is that most were riffraff, hooligans, and elements of landlord and rich peasant origin. After they mixed into the army, they felt that life was hard, they couldn't be casual, they were afraid of death, and they were not easy to educate. Poor peasant and farm laborer soldiers, on the contrary, generally believed that having food and clothing in the army was better than at home, they were easy to educate, and their ideological and political consciousness could be quickly improved. Due to past deviations in the class line not being clear, unclear organizational lines were created, investigations and statistics on class background became mere formalities, and education lacked strength. The team's research concluded that implementing the class line, i.e., "concretizing the mass line," was the key to correcting deviations. Therefore, they organized soldiers of poor peasant and farm laborer origin and those who performed well in the company, strengthened their education, made them realize that they were the backbone of the people's army, and helped them overcome their shortcomings. As a result, they made rapid progress and played a great role in this implementation of building a people's army and eliminating landlord ideology.

　　晋绥建军经验
    【新华社晋绥二十一日电】晋绥军区政治部工作团在凉城部工作，获得“贫雇农战士为骨干是部队一切工作的基础”的建军新经验。该团深入连队后，光着重调查两个问题，即（一）不问成份和来历的指战员对部队各种工作及其对土地改革、对家庭、对战斗等问题的不同态度与表现。（二）积极分子与落后分子的具体情况。结果发现贫雇农成份战士在言论上及对各种工作都有坚定立场，但他们多数不会说话，表现老老实实，好象不聪明，在部队中没地位，常被看成中间分子。而能说会道，表现“聪明”的，不少为成份不纯的分子，但反而被看重提拔以致过去若干所谓英雄模范、干部和党员，结果是垮台蜕化。同时过去有人认为开小差的大多数是家境贫苦缺乏劳动力的人，而事实是大多数为兵痞二流子、地主、富农的成份，他们混入部队后感觉生活苦，不能随便，怕死不易接受教育，而贫雇农战士则相反地普遍认为在部队中有吃有穿比家里强，易接受教育，思想与政治觉悟能迅速提高。由于过去阶级路线不明确的偏向，造成组织路线不明确，调查统计成份、流于形式及教育缺乏力量等现象。该团研究结果，认为贯彻阶级路线，即“群众路线具体化”，是纠正偏向之关键，乃据此在连队中将贫雇农成份及表现好的战士组织起来，加强教育，使其认识他们是人民军队的骨干，克服其缺点。实施结果，他们进步很快，在这次执行建设人民军队清除地主思想中，起了很大的作用。
