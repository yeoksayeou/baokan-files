Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 23rd: A Tianjin newspaper reports: Besieged by the People's Liberation Army on all sides, the KMT troops in Tianjin, in a state of panic, are forcibly ordering residents to demolish their houses to build city defense fortifications. Over 1,500 households in five villages including Zhangxinzhuang on the outskirts of Tianjin received notices, ordering them to demolish their houses by the 1st of this month. Feeling that this would leave them homeless, all the residents of these five villages sent representatives to the KMT Municipal Government and the Provisional Council on the 30th of last month to petition. Although they were granted a delay in demolition, the villagers were required to build defensive fortifications themselves, with the cost of the project to be borne by the residents of the five villages. The residents' representatives went to the KMT Municipal Government again on the 1st to petition for exemption from construction, but the KMT Municipal Government shirked responsibility, saying they needed to consult with the military, and the petition has yet to be resolved.

Moreover, the KMT troops in Tangshan are panicking. In addition to the moats and pillboxes built around the city long ago, they also plan to add abatis around the pillboxes, requiring approximately 10,000 small trees. Because the villages are all in the hands of the People's Liberation Army, it is very difficult to procure timber. The City Defense Engineering Office pushed this matter to the "Military-Civilian Cooperation Station," but the latter refused to accept it. However, the KMT Municipal Government rebuked the "Cooperation Station" for "delaying military opportunities," and the personnel of the station, feeling unable to bear the responsibility, preferred to resign en masse on June 27th.

Furthermore, after Changli was captured and then voluntarily evacuated by the People's Liberation Army, the KMT authorities are forcing the people to rebuild all the city defense works and pillboxes. Recently, the county authorities have decided to demolish the residences on the southeast sides of the city in order to "strengthen city defenses." The people are extremely angry about this and are brewing resistance.

　　在人民解放军威胁下 　 天津唐山蒋军恐慌
  　强令居民拆房构筑工事
    【新华社陕北二十三日电】津报讯：津市蒋军在四周人民解放军的威胁下，慌乱之余，强令居民拆毁房屋构筑城防工事。津市郊张辛庄等五个村住户一千五百余户接获通知，限于本月一日将住房拆除。该五村全体住户以此将使彼等无家可归，遂于上月三十日推派代表赴蒋市府及临参会请愿，结果虽允缓拆，但要各该村民另筑防御工事，所需工程费用，要五村住户自行负担。居民代表于一日再度赴蒋市府请愿，要求免筑，但蒋市府推托须与军方商议，请愿尚无结果。
    又，唐山蒋军恐慌，除城周早筑护城壕及碉堡外，又计划在碉堡四周加添鹿砦，约需小树万株。因乡村均在人民解放军手中，木材筹措甚难，城防工程处乃将此事推与“军民合作站”办理，后者则拒不接受。但蒋记市府斥责“合作站”为“贻误戎机”，该站人员以责任难负，宁愿滚蛋，遂于六月二十七日决定总辞职。
    又，昌黎目为人民解放军攻克又主动撤出后，一切城防工事碉堡蒋当局均迫令人民重新修筑。近该县当局并决定为“加强城防”，将城厢东南两面之民居尽予拆除，人民对此极感愤怒，正酝酿反抗。
