　　Pingding Summarizes Forty Days of Mass Movement
[Report from Pingding] The Pingding County Committee convened an enlarged cadre meeting earlier this month to summarize the mass movement in the new district. Comrade Zhao Yuting, the county secretary, summarized the basic situation and basic experiences as follows: After forty days of mass movement, the situation in the new district of Pingding has been fully opened up. From the perspective of the entire county, the movement is gradually moving towards a deeper, more intense, and more widespread stage. In terms of the scale of the movement: Out of a total of 141 natural villages in the newly restored and newly recovered areas of the county, 122 villages have already undergone significant action. According to statistics from 79 villages, 883 traitors, despots, and landlords have been struggled against, accounting for 1% of the total population. More than 40,000 people participated in the movement, accounting for more than half of the total population. Over 16,000 mu of land, over 4,900 shi of grain, 5,114 rooms, 700 livestock, 292 jin of silver ingots, 13 liang and 7 qian of pure gold, and other properties have been seized from the traitors, despots, and landlords. The masses have their own organizations, including over 7,000 members of the workers' and peasants' associations, extensive turn-over groups, and a preliminary development of over 2,000 militiamen. 830 cadres and core members have been trained. The main experiences gained during the movement: (1) Resolutely support the masses and boldly give them power, which is reflected in three aspects: First, the leadership, from top to bottom, destroys stubborn puppet organizations and detains and suppresses traitors and puppets to establish our new regime. Expose and suppress special agents who spread rumors at any time. Second, at the beginning of the movement, we approved the actions of advanced elements, who represented the masses and connected with the masses in the early stages of the movement. Third, resolutely support honest and upright poor peasants and hired laborers to take the stage, and give all power to the workers' and peasants' associations. The devolution of power must be thorough. The power to deal with family members of military personnel and cadres should also be given to the workers' and peasants' associations. (2) Implement the principle of "one pot of cooking," starting with the most prominent figures and the guys the masses hate the most. During the struggle, political, economic, blood debts, and money debts are settled together. However, to make the movement thorough, it is also necessary to mobilize the masses to pursue hidden properties and discuss whether the landlords have bowed their heads. Conduct a comparison of family assets. The slogan is "If the landlords are stubborn, we will be more stubborn." In this process, combine the struggle of pulling down the landlord's walls and digging "air-raid shelters." (3) Grasp the mood of the masses and implement ideological mobilization: such as the convening of peasant conferences and individual visits to hear grievances. Ideological mobilization was implemented in every aspect of the entire movement. In the process of struggle, educate the masses to recognize the stubbornness, tricks, and conspiracies of the landlords. In the process of distributing the fruits of victory, mobilize the poor peasants and hired laborers to discuss who should be divided and who should not be divided. Thoroughly divide class boundaries ideologically and organizationally, which plays a great role in uniting ourselves, especially in uniting the middle peasants.

　　平定总结四十天群运
    【本报平定讯】本月上旬平定县委召开全县扩干会，总结新区群运。县书赵雨亭同志总结基本情况与基本经验如下：平定新区经过四十天的群运，已全面的轰开了局面，在全县来看，运动是逐渐走向深入猛烈普遍的阶段：从运动的规模来看：全县新恢复区及新收复区共一百四十一个自然村，已经大动过的占一百二十二个村，根据七十九个村的统计，已经斗过奸霸地主八百八十三个，占总人口的百分之一，参加运动人数四万余，占全部人口二分之一强，清算出奸霸地主土地一万六千余亩，粮食四千九百余石，房子五千一百一十四间，牲口七百头，元宝二百九十二斤，赤金十三斤七两及其他财物。群众已有了自己的组织，计工农会有七千余人，有广泛的翻身小组，初步发展了民兵武装二千余人，培养了干部和骨干分子八百三十个。运动中取得的几点基本经验：（一）坚决的撑腰作主，大胆的放手放权，表现在三方面：一、领导上自上而下对顽伪组织的摧毁，及对奸伪的扣捕镇压，建立我们新的政权。随时揭露特务造谣，并及时予以镇压。二、运动开始，我们是批准了先进分子的行动的，在运动初期，它是代表群众连系群众的。三、坚决扶持老实纯正的贫雇农上台，一切权力交给工农会，放权要彻底。对军属干属也要放权给工农会处理。（二）贯彻一锅煮的方针，先从搬大头子和群众最痛恨的家伙入手，斗争时，政治、经济、血债、钱债一齐清算。但运动要搞的彻底，还要发动群众追要隐蔽财产，讨论地主是否低头？进行比家当计算，口号是“地主顽强，我们更顽强”。在这的当中，又结合拉地主墙角、挖“防空洞”斗争。（三）掌握群众情绪，贯彻思想发动：如农民大会的召开及个别访苦，在整个运动的各个环节贯彻了思想发动，在斗的过程中，教育群众认识地主顽强、花样、阴谋；在分配果实过程中，发动贫雇看讨论谁该分，谁不该分。从思想上组织上彻底划分阶级界线，在团结自己特别是团结中农的作用很大。
