    Shexian Luoyu Area
    Inspects Economy and Prepares for Famine
    [This newspaper's dispatch] More than ten villages in the seventh district of Shexian received rain on the 2nd of this month, and most of the land was planted. After the rain, some of the masses became lax in their thinking regarding economy and famine preparation. According to inspections, for example, after rain fell in Shitai, the masses fed the collected wild vegetables to the cattle. Tian Shouchan of Taizhuang said: "Before the rain, we ate thin porridge and drank thin gruel at noon every day. After the rain, we continued to eat thick porridge and noodles." Most of the masses felt that since the land had been planted, it didn't matter, and they would get at least 30% of the harvest even with late planting. They lacked awareness of saving food and economizing in preparation for famine. In light of this situation, the leadership in the areas that received rain is paying attention to inspecting the masses' thinking, overcoming paralysis and a mentality of僥倖, and educating the masses to recognize that planting the land does not equate to recovering grain. At the same time, planting is too late this year, and the annual yield has already been reduced, so economizing must continue. (Reported by Qianzhong Qiangzhong)

    涉县落雨地区
    检查节约备荒
    【本报讯】涉县七区在本月二号有十余村庄落了雨，大部把地种上，雨后部分群众思想上对节约备荒麻痹起来，据检查如史邰落雨后，群众将采的野菜喂了牛，台庄田手川说：“未下雨前每天晌午吃糠喝稀饭，落雨后又继续吃开稠饭、面条”。大部群众思想上感觉种上地了，不要紧啦，见苗三分收哩，对于备荒省吃俭用没认识。根据这种情况，落了雨的地区，领导上正注意检查群众思想，克服麻痹侥幸心理，教育群众认识虽说种上地，但不等于收回粮食，同时今年种的太晚，年量已经减收了，节约还要继续进行。（乾种抢种报）
