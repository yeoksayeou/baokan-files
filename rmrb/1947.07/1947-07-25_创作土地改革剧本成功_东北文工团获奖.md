Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 21st – The one-act play “The Struggle Against ‘Fanba’ (Reversal of Verdicts),” reflecting the land reform movement in the Northeast, has been widely praised by audiences since its premiere in Harbin on the 11th. The Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party believes that the play profoundly reflects reality and has significant educational value for the current land reform work. It has awarded the playwright and performers a major merit and also provided material rewards. The play was written by Li Zhihua of the Second Troupe of the Northeast Literary and Art Workers. The content depicts how feudal landlords in the Northeast, when the masses first rise up, use all kinds of conspiracies to ensure that land is nominally distributed but not actually divided. After the land work team leaves, they collude with "Central Bandits" (referring to bandits working for the KMT) and Chiang Kai-shek's special agents, using their lackeys to counterattack the peasants, brutally killing peasant association cadres, seizing leadership of the peasant associations, and carrying out a "fanba" (restoration) plot. The peasants then rise up again to carry out the struggle against "fanba." When writing this play, the author went to the countryside twice, lived in peasants' homes, and submitted the script to the peasants for modification and correction. Therefore, the play can grasp the central issues of the current land reform in the Northeast, has a deep Northeast rural flavor, and portrays the characteristics of the Northeast countryside and peasants.

　　创作土地改革剧本成功
  　东北文工团获奖
    【新华社东北二十一日电】反映东北土地改革运动之独幕剧“反‘翻把’斗争”，自十一日在哈市演出后，获得观众一致好评，中共东北局宣传要以该剧深刻反映现实，对当前土地改革工作深具教育意义，特予该剧作者及演出人员记大功一次，亦予物质奖励。该剧为东北文艺工作第二团李之华所作，内容描写东北封建地主在群众才起来时，用一切阴谋手段使土地明分暗不分，土地工作团走后，即勾结“中央胡子”及蒋特，利用狗腿子对农民进行反攻，残杀农会干部，夺取农会领导权，进而反“翻把”（即复辟之意）阴谋。农民乃再度起来进行反“翻把”的斗争。作者写这剧本时，曾二次下乡，住在农民家里，并将剧本交农民修改纠正，故该剧能抓住当前东北土地改革的中心问题，具有深厚的东北农村风味，并刻划出东北农村与农民的特性。
