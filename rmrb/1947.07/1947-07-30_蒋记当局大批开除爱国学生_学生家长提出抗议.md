Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: An Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 26th reports: Parents of students expelled from major middle schools in Shanghai have filed protests with the Chiang Kai-shek educational authorities, opposing the unjustified dismissal of their children. Since the end of the summer vacation in late June, the Chiang Kai-shek Ministry of Education has adopted despicable means to deal with patriotic students, already forcing schools to expel 430 students. The reasons for expulsion are mostly related to "political thought or activities," particularly their participation in the May anti-civil war and anti-hunger movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 28th: Shanghai News reports: On the 28th of last month, a tragic incident occurred in Guangzhou where special agent students beat a Director of Studies to death. Cai Huifu, the Director of Studies of the Lingnan University Affiliated Middle School, refused the unreasonable demand of a few special agent students in the senior graduating class to publicly disclose chemistry exam questions on the evening of the 28th. As Cai stepped out of the classroom, the special agent students turned off the lights and surrounded Cai, beating him severely, then pushed Cai from upstairs to the ground floor, immediately rupturing blood vessels in his chest, rendering him unconscious. He was sent to Boji Hospital the next day, but died of his injuries that evening. The tragedy has caused tremendous shock and anger in Guangzhou's educational circles, who unanimously advocate for severe punishment of the special agent murderers. Cai was 46 years old, a Master of Science and Mathematics from the University of the Philippines, and had been teaching at Lingnan University Affiliated Middle School for ten years.

  　学生家长提出抗议
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】美联社上海二十六日电：上海各大中学被开除学生之家长，已向蒋记教育当局提出抗议，反对其子弟被无理斥退。自六月底暑假以来，蒋记教育部采取卑鄙手段对付爱国学生，已迫令各校开除学生达四百三十名。开除理由大部为“政治思想或活动”问题，特别因他们参加五月反内战反饥饿运动。
    【新华社陕北二十八日电】沪报讯：上月二十八日广州发生特务学生殴毙教务主任惨案。岭南大学附中教务主任蔡辉甫二十八日晚拒绝高中部毕业班少数特务学生要求公开化学试题之无理要胁，当蔡氏步出课室时，特务学生即熄灯向蔡氏围殴，复将蔡氏从楼上推落地下，当场跌破胸部血管不省人事。至翌日始送博济医院，及晚伤重毙命。惨剧发生后，广州教育界震愤异常，一致主张严惩特务凶手。蔡氏年四十六岁，菲律滨大学数理硕士，任教岭大附中已十年。
