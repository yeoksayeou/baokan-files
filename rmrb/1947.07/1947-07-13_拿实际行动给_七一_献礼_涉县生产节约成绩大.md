(Report from She County) Cadres and masses in She County are commemorating "July 1st" with practical actions in production and savings to combat drought and prepare for famine, and have already achieved significant results: 55 villages in the county have dry-planted 113,606 mu of land, 27 villages have reclaimed 3,894 mu of滩地 (river flats/alluvial land), 41 villages have dug 545 water ponds and wells, and opened 7 canals. 56 villages have engaged in sideline production, earning over 3,961 million yuan, and 25 villages have woven 2,562 jin of cloth. 56 villages have collected over 410,000 jin of wild vegetables, and 27 villages have saved 62,133 jin of rice. The construction of water conservancy projects, engagement in sideline production, and collection of wild vegetables are still proceeding in full swing. Among the most outstanding examples are: the masses in Wangjinzhuang, under the leadership of labor hero Cao Shankui, launched a production and savings merit-building campaign. In the past month, the entire village of 2,800 people saved 10,530 jin of rice and collected 56,160 jin of dried vegetables. Sideline production earned over 1,620,000 yuan. The entire village dry-planted 428 mu of land and is now digging ponds and wells. In the Sixth District, labor hero Zhao Fucheng first set a good example to influence the entire village. Currently, the entire village has switched to using alternative grains, and collected 11,000 jin of wild vegetables in three days, dry-planting two-thirds of the land. In the Third District, labor hero Qu Baocai of Houxiyu put forward vivid slogans such as "Planting one seed is one seed, planting is always better than not planting" to get through to the masses, and now the entire village has dry-planted over 1,400 mu of land. Cadres in Dongshu led the masses to organize 39 mutual aid groups, dry-planting 452 mu of millet and over 8,000 eggplants, and proposed "Moving three points of wealth, wealth won't come without moving." They led the masses to engage in transportation, earning 273,000 yuan in three days, and collected over 8,000 jin of wild vegetables. In the Second District, the chairman of the Yuli Farmers' Association led the entire village to plant over 4,200 mu. In the Fourth District, after the "July 1st" memorial meeting, Liu Caibang of Jingdian went back and led the masses in discussing how to prevent famine and save resources, promoting the dry-planting of over 5,000 mu of land throughout the village, and collective vegetable gathering for one day. The masses also established savings methods such as: not smoking foreign cigarettes, not drinking alcohol, eating more bran and vegetables, and less rice and flour. The Shibo base focused on completing planting with a concentrated effort. Now, the entire district has planted a total of over 59,000 mu of land and collected over 140,000 jin of vegetables. The entire district is now launching a 100-day campaign to save life-saving grain. (United Office)

(Special Dispatch from this Newspaper) According to a report from Comrade Wang Tingdong, Secretary of the Wu'an County Party Committee: The urban and rural masses of Wu'an County greeted and commemorated the Party's birthday "July 1st" with boundless enthusiasm. From "July 1st" to "July 1st," the towns and villages were filled with the sounds of gongs and drums, performing stories of production and preparation for famine. The emancipated households in the thirteen streets of Chengguan couldn't think of how to repay the Communist Party's kindness, so they carried a portrait of Chairman Mao around the streets for a day, as a way to celebrate the Party's birthday. The entire county is taking the actual achievements in production to overcome famine as a gift to the Party. After watering and planting 50,000 mu of cotton fields, they immediately engaged in soil loosening, dry planting, and rushing to plant. Half of the land north of the city has been rushed to plant, and the south of the city has largely completed digging manure and sending fertilizer. At the end of the Dragon Boat Festival, a summary of the 100-day spinning and weaving campaign was made. The 74,537 weaving women in the county have completed 914,000 jin of cloth. After selecting 1,342 weaving heroes and skilled workers, the second 100-day spinning and weaving campaign has already begun, with each woman guaranteeing to weave another twelve jin of cloth before the Mid-Autumn Festival. Under the call of production to overcome famine, the masses proposed to "cross the sea like the Eight Immortals, each showing their special abilities," and enthusiastically launched a production and famine-overcoming merit-building campaign. Villages established production and famine-overcoming committees, mobilized the masses, and commended models. Wang Pihuai, an emancipated hero from Nanhezhuang, is determined to become a labor hero again. Based on the principle of everyone doing their best, he organized 80% of the labor force in the entire village. Female labor was used wherever possible, saving male labor for picking stones on slopes and transporting goods to solve difficulties and prepare for famine. An old middle peasant from Nanzhuang made a plan to save 78,000 yuan this year. Landlords provoked him, saying, "If you get rich, the village will struggle against you." He said, "I'm not afraid of struggle, I'm only afraid of starving." Li Qi'e, an eighteen-year-old girl, wove nineteen jin of cloth in two months, watered and planted flowers for eleven days, and was also a model in digging manure and tilling stubble. She said, "Women are oppressed only because they lack ability," "Relying on others doesn't count as being a person." Military dependents with labor declined assistance in farming, and those without labor did odd jobs themselves. Savings models are emerging in large numbers. The masses' slogans are "Having a thousand tickets, don't forget interest and don't be greedy, having ten thousand shi of grain, don't forget to mix elm leaves and coarse grains," "Better to skip half a meal than skip a whole meal." Huang Suitang of Chongyi still uses his old small wooden bowl to measure rice, and has never run out of bran and vegetables, even though he has been emancipated. Some had fifteen shi of grain left over from last year and still have fifteen shi now, relying entirely on picking stones on slopes to survive. Some didn't spend any money while participating in the war, but instead earned money by investing in the war participation cooperative.

    拿实际行动给“七一”献礼
    涉县生产节约成绩大
    【本报涉县讯】涉县干群以生产节约抗旱备荒的实际行动，纪念“七一”，现已获得显著成绩：全县已有五十五个村干种地十一万三千六百零六亩，二十七个村修滩地三千八百九十四亩，四十一村掏水池水井五百四十五个，开渠七道。五十六个村搞副业赚洋三千九百六十一万余元，二十五个村织布两千五百六十二斤。五十六个村打野菜四十一万余斤，二十七个村节约米六万二千一百三十三斤。兴修水利搞副业打野菜，仍在热火朝天的进行着。其中最突出的如：王金庄群众在劳英曹善魁领导下，展开生产节约立功运动，一月以来，全村两千八百口人，节约米一万零五百三十斤，采干菜五万六千一百六十斤。副业共赚洋一百六十二万余元。全村干种地四百二十八亩，现在正掏池掏井。六区郝赵劳英赵辅成自己先订好计划来影响全村，现全村一律换了饭，三天打野菜一万一千斤，干种地三分之二。三区后西峪劳英屈保才提出：种一棵算一棵，种了总比不种强等生动口号来打通群众思想，现全村干种地一千四百多亩。东戍干部领导群众组织起三十九个互助组，干种谷子四百五十二亩，茄子八千余棵，并提出“动动三分财，不动财不来”。领导群众搞运输，三天赚洋二十七万三千元，采野菜八千余斤。二区峪里农会主席领导全村下种四千二百余亩。四区井店刘才榜“七一”纪念会后，回去领导群众讨论如何防荒节约，推动全村干种地五千余亩，集体打菜一天。群众又订出：不吸洋烟不喝酒，多吃糠菜少吃米面等节约办法。石泊基点抓紧突击完成下种。现在全区统计共种地五万九千余亩，打菜十四万多斤。现全区正开展节约一百天的救命粮运动。（联合办公室）
    【本报特讯】据武安县委书记王庭栋同志报导：武安城乡群众曾以无限热情迎接与纪念党的生日“七一”，从“七一”到“七一”城镇乡村到处锣鼓喧天，扮演生产备荒故事。城关十三街的翻身户想不出该怎样报共产党的恩，就抬上毛主席像满街转了一天，算是给党祝寿。全县更以生产渡荒的实际成绩作为给党的献礼，五万亩棉田担水点种后，紧接着亮窑、旱种、抢种，城北土地已抢种二分之一，城南已大部完成刨圊送粪。端午前总结百日纺织，全县七四五三七个纺织妇女已完成九十一万四千斤布，评选出一三四二个纺织英雄和能手后，第二个百日纺织运动又已开始，每个妇女保证要在中秋节前再织成十二斤布。在生产渡荒的号召下，群众提出要“八仙过海各显其能”，热烈展开生产渡荒立功运动，村村成立生产渡荒委员会，发动群众，表扬模范。南贺庄翻身英雄王丕怀决心再当劳动英雄，在各尽所能的原则下组织了全村百分之八十的劳力，凡能用女劳力的就不用男劳力，节余下男劳力拾坎运输，解决困难准备渡荒。南庄老中农订计划今年要剩余七万八千元，地主们挑拨说：“你发了家村上要斗争你”，他说：“我不怕斗争只怕挨饿”。十八岁的姑娘李起娥两个月织布十九斤、担水种花十一天，刨圊刨茬也是模范，她说：“女人受欺压，只为本领差”，“依靠人过不算人”。有劳力的军属谢绝代耕，没劳力的自己做零活。节约模范更是大量涌现，群众的口号是“家有千万票不忘利不套，家有万石粮不忘榆叶掺粗糠”，“宁叫半顿不叫断顿”。崇义黄随堂虽然翻了身，还用过去的小木碗下米，糠菜没有断。有去年打下十五石粮，现在还存十五石，全靠拾坎渡日的。有在参战中没花钱，反而在参战合作社中入股赚了钱。
