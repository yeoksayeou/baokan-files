Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 6th: Comprehensive report: The good news of the Soviet people completing and exceeding their economic construction plan for the first half of the year continues to pour in like snowflakes. Various industries in Moscow have been swept up in the broad socialist competition commemorating the 30th anniversary of the October Revolution (November 7th this year). Moscow industry has overfulfilled the plan for the first half of the year, with total industrial production exceeding the same period last year by 20 percent. Two hundred and forty-eight factories and workshops even completed their July plans by July 3rd. As of June 1st, industrial production in Leningrad had completed 94 percent of the six-month plan, with the output of most enterprises increasing by 100 to 150 percent compared to last year. The large steel factories in the Urals have completed their June plans ahead of schedule and have overproduced tens of thousands of tons of steel beyond the planned targets. The Soviet Union's post-war five-year plan's construction projects are also proceeding on a large scale to build a new life for the working people. Moscow's housing construction plan fund for this year has increased by 66 million rubles compared to last year, restoring residential areas to twice the size of the pre-war five years. Plans are in place to build eight skyscrapers by 1952, one of which will be the tallest in Europe. Leningrad will add 500,000 square meters of residential space this year, with over 300 buildings under restoration, surrounded by worker and staff housing with gardens, which are being built in the suburbs. In Stalingrad, thirteen hospitals are already serving the people, and schools have been built. Government buildings, residential houses, railway stations, theaters, hotels, and other buildings are also under construction in various cities. Large-scale construction is also underway in the rural areas of the republics of Belarus, Ukraine, Estonia, and Uzbekistan.
