    The Creation and Performance of Artists
    The Experience of the JiluYu Federation of Literary and Art Circles in Transforming Old Artists
    Wang Yaping
    Since the Folk Art Department of the JiluYu Federation of Literary and Art Circles conducted detailed investigations and research on old artists, it learned that there were over a thousand folk artists scattered in Zhangqiu, Zhuxian, Chaocheng, Xin County, Dong'a, Dongping, Shou Zhang, Tangyi, Yanggu, ＠ Mountain, and Fan County, engaged in shadow plays, yangqin (dulcimer), storytelling with drum accompaniment, painting and sculpting, bookselling, and wind and percussion bands. Most of these artists had inherited their skills from their ancestors, learning through apprenticeship and diligent practice. They were skilled in playing wind instruments, stringed instruments, singing, storytelling, and attracting the masses with their performance skills. Several artists who had been active in the area for a long time and possessed excellent singing and playing techniques, such as Shen Guanying and Hei San, were well-known figures among the people. When they were mentioned, everyone's face lit up, feeling that only these people could tell them history, sing stories, and provide them with rich entertainment.
    In order to recruit these folk artists, transform their thinking, change their lives, help them progress, improve their skills, and enable them to stand up and give play to their creative talents, contributing to revolutionary propaganda, the Folk Art Department established an artist training class. One line connected to another, and all lines had connections. Since the establishment of the artist training class, word spread quickly through mutual recommendation, even more effectively than advertising. Soon, artists from all directions came to the Folk Art Department to register. In less than half a year, more than two hundred artists had been trained successively. After successfully completing their training, they returned to the villages to perform. The feudal, lewd, absurd, and decadent content of their storytelling and singing was replaced with new content about land reform, self-defense wars, and production savings. The attitude of storytelling and the performance techniques were also appropriately changed, and attention was paid to the impact on the masses at all times.
    Currently, there are still more than forty people in the artist training class. Some are temporarily undergoing training, while others are willing to permanently leave production, no longer farming while selling their performances, or making a living by private performances. They are willing to completely transform themselves in the Folk Art Department and engage in revolutionary propaganda work. Recently, from "July 1st" to "July 7th," to celebrate the 26th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party, they organized an artist propaganda team, carrying a red flag with the words "Artist Propaganda Team." Wherever the small flag went, the masses warmly welcomed them. Each artist wore a glorious red flower on their chest, a flower of joy, a flower of victory, a flower of glory for the artists who had stood up. They performed for six consecutive days, with one day canceled due to rain. A table listing the location, type of performance, and number of audience members (program details elsewhere) can show the impact of their propaganda:
    Time                      Location                Type of Performance           Audience Number
    Eve of July 1st            Party School              Storytelling with drum accompaniment, Music, Yangqin    2,000 people
    "July 1st"                Liu Village               Storytelling with drum accompaniment, Shadow play,  900 people
                                                         Music, Yangqin
    "July 2nd"                Kong Village              Same as above                  1,500 people
    "July 3rd"                Chaocheng                 Same as above                  5,000 people
    "July 5th"                Kangyuan                  Same as above                  1,000 people
    "July 6th"                Chaocheng                 Same as above                  2,500 people
    Looking at this performance statistics table, we can see that over the six days of performances, 13,000 people were affected by them. They directly touched and educated the masses with their mouths, hands, and music. This was much faster, more powerful, and had a greater impact than a book, a magazine, or a pictorial. In the past, our cadres and comrades engaged in cultural and educational work underestimated and did not fully recognize the skills and creative abilities of folk artists. After these performances, we watched and listened, and we were greatly moved by their performances. We realized that not only could their performances directly move the masses and preserve and develop the folk art style that the masses loved and accepted, but also, after ideological transformation and technical improvement, they greatly developed their creativity. Whether it was playing wind instruments, stringed instruments, singing, or storytelling, there were new creations. These creations proved that their skills had taken another step forward and were closer to the demands of reality and the demands of the masses.
    The artist training class has four groups: 1. Shadow Play Group; 2. Storytelling with Drum Accompaniment Group; 3. Yangqin Group; 4. Music Group. In addition, there are also magic and circus troupes. Through training, pouring out grievances, standing up, changing lives, and changing minds, their vision changed, and their thoughts changed. The old habits of smoking, drinking old wine, laziness, sleeping in, arguing with people at the slightest provocation, losing their temper, believing in gods, and believing in ghosts, all the bad habits of the old artists, have been changed. They automatically quit smoking and drinking. In the morning, they collectively ran, studied, and when they set off for performances, they also lined up in neat formations. Everyone said that they had been trained into a "cultural army" under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought. Here, let me introduce them group by group:
    1. Shadow Play Group: There are five or six shadow play artists. They have two old shadow play frames and four sets of old shadow plays. For convenience and to make it easier for the masses to accept, we still use their old frames and old glass-framed shadow play versions. Only the content has been changed to: "Eighteen Years of Heroic Struggle," "How to Raise Children?" "The Life of Chiang Kai-shek," and several production pictures. The frames are no longer secretly covered up. In addition to the bottom part where you can peek through the small glass holes, the top part can also be viewed by the masses. The artists no longer sing the old tunes of "Look if I tell you to look, a mouse is carrying a big wild cat." "Look if I tell you to look, a foreign girl is inside!" The feudal, superstitious, and lewd old tunes have been replaced. Based on the new content, they sing while performing, singing in a simple and easy-to-understand way. The masses happily listen and laugh, and they clearly understand the characters and stories in the shadow plays. They hate what should be hated and love what should be loved, greatly arousing the masses' awareness and satisfying the masses' appreciation.
    2. Storytelling with Drum Accompaniment Group: There are more than ten artists, three of whom are blind. One can play the instrument, one can sing, and another is a female artist who can also sing. I heard the blind artist couple singing "Miss Kong Er's Wedding" and "Foot Binding Scene," singing and reciting dialogue, one playing the mother and one playing the daughter, performing very movingly. The masses said, "We who have eyes are not as good as those who don't! They sing so well!" The remaining artists can all sing. Under the leadership of the meritorious artist Shen Guanying, they have composed many storytelling pieces, such as "Land Reform," "Li Er Gets Rich," "The Great Battle of Yanghu," "Persuading Compatriots," "Old Chiang Recognizes a Godfather," and "Ma Changzhai," etc. Needless to say, as soon as these storytelling pieces with new content are sung to the masses, they can immediately accept them, believing that these stories are about real people and real events, and about characters that the masses love and characters that they hate. They have created and performed characters familiar to the masses, their emotions have been comforted and stimulated, and the masses' thoughts have also been enlightened, further strengthening their hatred of landlords and bullies and their love for heroes and role models. In particular, Hei San, a well-known artist in the area, composed a segment called "Attacking Yanggu," which all happened in the past two or three years. The masses listened to each sentence, moved and praised each sentence, "That's right, it's all true events on our land!" the masses discussed. They all remembered the facts of the traitor Er Jinling killing and harming the people; they also remembered the facts of the Eighth Route Army attacking Yanggu and saving the people. Hei San doesn't know how to read, but he can add his own experience to the story of attacking Yanggu - he was arrested by Er Jinling and spent more than a month in Yanggu prison. He is very familiar with the crimes of the traitors, and when he composes and sings them, they are also very moving. If it is said that only the creation of the masses themselves can meet the requirements of the masses, this work aptly illustrates this principle.
    3. Yangqin Group: There are more than ten artists, one person playing the yangqin, with a huqin and a four-stringed instrument harmonizing, and another person playing the rhythm. The sound of the instruments alone attracts the masses. When played, there are clear and distinct sounds, joyful tunes and sorrowful sounds, which are very suitable for rural women to listen to. The content of the yangqin is suitable for singing storytelling pieces. If there are long-form folk stories and historical stories, it will be even more popular with the masses if they can sing for three or five days. Unfortunately, such works have not yet been created. The content they are currently singing is the same as the content sung by the Storytelling with Drum Accompaniment Group.
    4. Music Group: There are more than ten artists, some of whom can play the sheng, some can play the flute, some can play the drum board, some can play the gong, some can play the huqin, some can play the four-stringed instrument, some can play the small cymbals, and some can sing, sing ditties, and sing operas. When they play together, they can unleash the power of music. They can play "Chairman Mao is the Sun," "Song Celebrating the Anniversary of the Communist Party," folk ditties, and ancient Chinese famous songs, such as "Three Variations on Plum Blossoms" and "Little Open Door," which is popular among the people. In order to inspire the masses, they collectively created "The Great Counteroffensive." In addition to participating in some dialogues and singing, they completely use instruments to express the military and civilian emotions of the large army marching south, crossing the Yellow River, and fighting the Chiang Kai-shek army. Individual performances are even more surprising and moving. One artist can use the huqin to play various opera excerpts, such as old male roles, young female roles, a cappella, and recitations. Even the sounds of gongs and drums can be played. When performing in Kangyuan, he played "Fen River," with men and women singing in duet, just like real people speaking and singing. Another artist can use the flute to play various opera excerpts and songs, which sound the same as human voices. The masses listened and repeatedly shouted "Bravo!" and applauded continuously.
    The creativity of the artists is truly amazing. We should value this creativity and promote this creativity. One cadre, after listening to their performances, excitedly said to me, "Only the blind can't see this creation, and only the deaf can't hear it!" In terms of merit, the efforts they have made in propaganda work are worthy of praise and should be praised. Their components are mostly tenant farmers, poor people, apprentices, and workers. Because they could not withstand the oppression of landlords and capitalists, they wanted to learn to sing, play, and learn to make a living. Some were physically disabled and had no way to live, so they ran out to learn to play and sing. Their class consciousness is very strong, and their spirit of ideological transformation and learning is very strong and persistent. They first sing the things they have composed with their companions, and then sing them with the masses. They hope to receive comments, and as long as they are pointed out, they immediately make very good corrections. A storytelling piece or a yangqin piece is often revised and sung again and again; sung and revised again and again, until the masses can understand it, love to listen to it, and are moved by it, only then is it completed. Naturally, in today's works spoken and written by them, there are still old traditions, old tunes, and old words, but if they continue to improve and continue to create, they will definitely write better works, and these works will be widely and rapidly spread among the masses.

    艺人的创造和演唱
    冀鲁豫文联改造旧艺人经验
    王亚平
    冀鲁豫文联民间艺术部，自从对旧艺人做了详细调查研究工作以后，知道散居在张秋、筑先、朝城、莘县、东阿、东平、寿张、堂邑、阳谷、＠山、范县一带的洋片、洋琴、坠子、画塑、雕刻、书店、吹鼓手等民间艺人就有千人以上。这些艺人大都是祖辈流传，拜师学艺，一步步下工用力锻炼出来的。他们都是能吹、能弹、能拉、能说、能打、能唱、能用自己的演唱技艺吸引广大群众的。有几个在这一带活动较久，唱拉技术很好的艺人，象沈冠英、黑三等，那竟是老百姓耳目中的“红人”，一提起他们来，谁都眉飞色舞，觉得只有这些人能给他们说历史、唱故事、给他们丰富的娱乐材料。
    民间艺术部为了收纳这些民间艺人，改造他们的思想，改变他们的生活，帮助他们进步，提高他们的技术，叫他们也翻身起来，发挥出创造才能，对革命宣传工作尽些力量，就成立了艺人训练班。一行近一行，行行有联系，自从艺人训练班成立了，你传我，我传你，比登广告还来得有效，很快地各方的艺人都投奔到民间艺术部来报名了。不到半年的工夫，陆陆续续受过训的就有二百多艺人，他们学习成功了，再回到乡村去演唱，那些封建、淫荡、荒唐、腐败的说唱内容都改换成土地改革、自卫战争、生产节约的新内容了，说唱的态度、表演技术也都适当的改变了，时时刻刻注意到对群众的影响。
    目前，留在艺人训练班的还有四十多个人。有的是临时受训的，有的愿意永远脱离生产，不再一面种地一面卖唱，或私人卖唱过生活，愿意在民间艺术部彻底改造自己，做革命宣传工作。最近“七一”到“七七”庆贺共产党二十六周年生日，他们组织了一个艺人宣传队，扛着一面红旗子，上面写着“艺人宣传队”，小旗走到的地方，群众都热烈的欢迎。每个艺人胸前，挂着一朵光荣的红花，那是快乐的花，胜利的花，艺人翻了身的光荣的花。他们一连出演了六天，中间有一天下雨，没有能演成。咱们把他们出演的地点、项别、（节目另详）观众人数列一个表，就可以看出他们宣传的影响：
    时间              地点            项别                  观众人数
    七一前夕          党校            坠子·音乐·洋琴      二○○○人
    “七一”          刘屯            坠子·洋片·            九○○人
                音乐·洋琴
    “七二”          孔庄            同前                  一五○○人
    “七三”          朝城            同前                  五○○○人
    “七五”          康园            同前                  一○○○人
    “七六”          朝城            同前                  二五○○人
    看了这个演出统计表，知道在六天的演出中，受到他们影响的就有一万三千人。他们用嘴、用手、用音乐直接地感动了群众，教育了群众，比起一本书，一册杂志、一张画报的力量就来得迅速、有力、影响大多了。从前，咱们的干部，搞文教工作的同志，对于民间艺人的技术，创造能力估计的不够，认识的不够，经过这几次的演出，我们看了，听了，也大大地被他们的演唱感动了，认识到不但他们所演所唱的能直接感动群众，能够保存并发扬了为群众欢喜接受的民间艺术风味，而且，经过思想改造，技术改进以后，他们更大大地发挥了创造力，无论吹、弹、拉、唱、都有新的创造。这些创造是证明他们的技术又提高了一步，和现实要求，群众要求也更接近了一步。
    艺人训练班，共有四组：一、洋片组；二、坠子组；三、洋琴组；四、音乐组，另外还有魔术与马戏团。经过了训练，倒苦水，翻身，改变生活，改换脑筋，他们的眼光变了，想法变了。那种吃烟、喝老酒、懒散、睡懒觉、动不动和人吵架、发脾气、信神、信鬼，一切旧艺人的毛病，坏习惯都改变了。他们自动地戒了烟酒，早晨起来，集体的跑步、学习、出发演唱的时候，也排着整齐的队伍，谁都说，他们已训练成毛主席思想领导下的一支“文化军队”了。这里，分组把他们介绍一下：
    一、洋片组：有五六位洋片艺人，他们有两个旧洋片架子，四套旧洋片。我们为了方便，叫群众容易接受，仍然用他们的旧架子，旧玻璃框的洋片版。只是把内容换上了：英勇奋斗十八年，怎样养孩子？蒋介石的一生，有几幅生产图。架子上面不再秘密的遮起来，除去下边的可以从玻璃小孔里望里瞧，上面的还可以叫群众观看。几位艺人，不再唱“叫你瞧来，你就瞧哇，老鼠叨着个大狸猫。”“叫你看来，你就看哪，外国大妮在里边！”那种封建、迷信、淫荡的旧调调了，他们根据着新内容一边拉一边唱，唱的通俗、好懂、群众欢喜的听着，笑着，对于洋片上的人物、故事、都很明白，该恨的恨，要爱的爱，大大地激发了群众的觉悟，满足了群众的欣赏。
    二、坠子组：有十多个艺人，三个瞎的，一个能拉，一个能唱，另一个是女艺人，也会唱。我听见那一对盲艺人夫妇对唱“孔二小姐结婚”，“放脚段”，一边唱，一边道白，一个装娘，一个装女，演的很动人。群众说：“咱这有眼的，还不抵人家没眼的哩！唱的真好！”其余的几位艺人，都会唱，在艺人功臣沈冠英领导下，他们编了许多坠子，象“土地改革”，“李二发家”，“大战杨湖”，“劝同胞”，“老蒋认干爹”，“马常寨”等。不消说，这些新内容的坠子，一唱给群众听，群众马上能够接受，认为这些坠子都是眼前的真人，真故事，都是群众热爱的人物，要恨的人物，他们把群众熟悉的人物创造了，演唱了，群众的情感得到了安慰，得到了激发，群众的思想，也得到了启发，更加强了对地主、恶霸的憎恨，对英雄、模范的热爱。特别，在这一带著名的艺人黑三，他编了一段“打阳谷”，都是近二三年的事，群众一句一句地听下去，一句一句地感动着，夸赞着，“说的对，都是咱地面上的真事！”群众们议论着。都想起了汉奸二金岭杀人、害老百姓的事实；也想起了八路军打阳谷、救人民的事实。黑三不认识字，他却能依照打阳谷的故事，加上自己的一段经验，——他被二金岭抓去在阳谷监狱里坐了一个多月，对于汉奸的罪恶，他十分熟悉，编出来，唱出来，就也十分动人，如果说只有群众自己的创造，才能合乎群众的要求，这种作品正恰当的说明了这个道理。
    三、洋琴组：有十几个艺人，一个人打洋琴，另有胡琴，四弦和着音，一个人打着节拍，只是乐器的响声就引吸了群众，打起来，清清切切地，喜有喜调，悲有悲音，很适合农村的妇女听。洋琴的内容，以唱故事性的东西合适，能有大部头的民间故事，历史故事，接着唱个三天五天就更能叫群众欢迎。可惜，这种作品还不能创造出来，他们目前演唱的东西，和坠子组唱的内容是一样的。
    四、音乐组：有十几个艺人，有的会吹笙，有的会吹笛子，有的会打鼓板，有的会打锣，有的会拉胡琴，有的会拉四弦，有的会敲小钹，有的会唱歌，唱小调，唱戏，他们合奏在一起，就能发挥了音乐的力量。他们能合奏“毛主席象太阳”，能合奏“庆祝共产党周年歌”，能合奏民间小调，能合奏中国的古歌名曲，象“梅花三弄”和流行在民间的“小开门”等。他们为了鼓舞群众，集体创造了“大反攻”，除参加一些道白、歌唱外，完全用乐器表示大军南征，渡黄河，打蒋军的军民情绪。个人表演上，更是出奇，动人。有一位艺人，能够用胡琴拉各种戏文，象老生、小旦、清唱、道白、就算锣鼓响器也都能拉得出来，在康园出演的时候，他拉了“汾河”，男女对唱，活象真人说的，真人唱的一样。另有一位艺人，能够用笛子吹出多种戏文、歌曲、也都和人唱出来的声音一样。群众听了，连连叫好，拍掌不息。
    艺人的创造力真够惊人的，我们应该重视这种创造，发扬这种创造。一位干部听了他们的演唱兴奋的对我说：“这种创造，除非瞎子才看不见，聋子才听不见哩！”如果论功劳，他们在宣传工作上尽的力量，是值得表扬，应该得到表扬。他们的成份多半是佃户、贫民、学徒、工人出身，因为受不了地主、资本家的压迫，才想学唱、学拉、学吹、学打来糊口谋生。有的是身体残疾了，没法生活，也跑出来学拉学唱。他们的阶级意识很强，思想翻造了，学习精神很是坚强，持久。自己编出来东西，先和同伴们唱唱，再和群众唱唱。希望都提意见，只要一指点，他们马上有很好的改正。一篇坠子，一个洋琴，常常改一回唱一回；唱一回，改一回，置到改的群众听懂了、爱听了、感动了，才算完成。自然，在今天他们口念出来的，笔写出来的作品，还存留着旧传统，旧调调，旧字眼，但如果不断地改进，不断地创造，一定会写出更好的作品，这些作品会很广泛地，很迅速地流传到群众当中。
