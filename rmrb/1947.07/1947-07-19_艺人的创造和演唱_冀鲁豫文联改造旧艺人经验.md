    The Creation and Performance of Artists
    The Experience of the JiluYu Federation of Literary and Art Circles in Transforming Old Artists
    Wang Yaping
    Since the Folk Art Department of the JiluYu Federation of Literary and Art Circles conducted detailed investigations and research on old artists, it learned that there were over a thousand folk artists scattered in Zhangqiu, Zhuxian, Chaocheng, Xin County, Dong'a, Dongping, Shou Zhang, Tangyi, Yanggu, ï¼  Mountain, and Fan County, engaged in shadow plays, yangqin (dulcimer), storytelling with drum accompaniment, painting and sculpting, bookselling, and wind and percussion bands. Most of these artists had inherited their skills from their ancestors, learning through apprenticeship and diligent practice. They were skilled in playing wind instruments, stringed instruments, singing, storytelling, and attracting the masses with their performance skills. Several artists who had been active in the area for a long time and possessed excellent singing and playing techniques, such as Shen Guanying and Hei San, were well-known figures among the people. When they were mentioned, everyone's face lit up, feeling that only these people could tell them history, sing stories, and provide them with rich entertainment.
    In order to recruit these folk artists, transform their thinking, change their lives, help them progress, improve their skills, and enable them to stand up and give play to their creative talents, contributing to revolutionary propaganda, the Folk Art Department established an artist training class. One line connected to another, and all lines had connections. Since the establishment of the artist training class, word spread quickly through mutual recommendation, even more effectively than advertising. Soon, artists from all directions came to the Folk Art Department to register. In less than half a year, more than two hundred artists had been trained successively. After successfully completing their training, they returned to the villages to perform. The feudal, lewd, absurd, and decadent content of their storytelling and singing was replaced with new content about land reform, self-defense wars, and production savings. The attitude of storytelling and the performance techniques were also appropriately changed, and attention was paid to the impact on the masses at all times.
    Currently, there are still more than forty people in the artist training class. Some are temporarily undergoing training, while others are willing to permanently leave production, no longer farming while selling their performances, or making a living by private performances. They are willing to completely transform themselves in the Folk Art Department and engage in revolutionary propaganda work. Recently, from "July 1st" to "July 7th," to celebrate the 26th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party, they organized an artist propaganda team, carrying a red flag with the words "Artist Propaganda Team." Wherever the small flag went, the masses warmly welcomed them. Each artist wore a glorious red flower on their chest, a flower of joy, a flower of victory, a flower of glory for the artists who had stood up. They performed for six consecutive days, with one day canceled due to rain. A table listing the location, type of performance, and number of audience members (program details elsewhere) can show the impact of their propaganda:
    Time                      Location                Type of Performance           Audience Number
    Eve of July 1st            Party School              Storytelling with drum accompaniment, Music, Yangqin    2,000 people
    "July 1st"                Liu Village               Storytelling with drum accompaniment, Shadow play,  900 people
                                                         Music, Yangqin
    "July 2nd"                Kong Village              Same as above                  1,500 people
    "July 3rd"                Chaocheng                 Same as above                  5,000 people
    "July 5th"                Kangyuan                  Same as above                  1,000 people
    "July 6th"                Chaocheng                 Same as above                  2,500 people
    Looking at this performance statistics table, we can see that over the six days of performances, 13,000 people were affected by them. They directly touched and educated the masses with their mouths, hands, and music. This was much faster, more powerful, and had a greater impact than a book, a magazine, or a pictorial. In the past, our cadres and comrades engaged in cultural and educational work underestimated and did not fully recognize the skills and creative abilities of folk artists. After these performances, we watched and listened, and we were greatly moved by their performances. We realized that not only could their performances directly move the masses and preserve and develop the folk art style that the masses loved and accepted, but also, after ideological transformation and technical improvement, they greatly developed their creativity. Whether it was playing wind instruments, stringed instruments, singing, or storytelling, there were new creations. These creations proved that their skills had taken another step forward and were closer to the demands of reality and the demands of the masses.
    The artist training class has four groups: 1. Shadow Play Group; 2. Storytelling with Drum Accompaniment Group; 3. Yangqin Group; 4. Music Group. In addition, there are also magic and circus troupes. Through training, pouring out grievances, standing up, changing lives, and changing minds, their vision changed, and their thoughts changed. The old habits of smoking, drinking old wine, laziness, sleeping in, arguing with people at the slightest provocation, losing their temper, believing in gods, and believing in ghosts, all the bad habits of the old artists, have been changed. They automatically quit smoking and drinking. In the morning, they collectively ran, studied, and when they set off for performances, they also lined up in neat formations. Everyone said that they had been trained into a "cultural army" under the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought. Here, let me introduce them group by group:
    1. Shadow Play Group: There are five or six shadow play artists. They have two old shadow play frames and four sets of old shadow plays. For convenience and to make it easier for the masses to accept, we still use their old frames and old glass-framed shadow play versions. Only the content has been changed to: "Eighteen Years of Heroic Struggle," "How to Raise Children?" "The Life of Chiang Kai-shek," and several production pictures. The frames are no longer secretly covered up. In addition to the bottom part where you can peek through the small glass holes, the top part can also be viewed by the masses. The artists no longer sing the old tunes of "Look if I tell you to look, a mouse is carrying a big wild cat." "Look if I tell you to look, a foreign girl is inside!" The feudal, superstitious, and lewd old tunes have been replaced. Based on the new content, they sing while performing, singing in a simple and easy-to-understand way. The masses happily listen and laugh, and they clearly understand the characters and stories in the shadow plays. They hate what should be hated and love what should be loved, greatly arousing the masses' awareness and satisfying the masses' appreciation.
    2. Storytelling with Drum Accompaniment Group: There are more than ten artists, three of whom are blind. One can play the instrument, one can sing, and another is a female artist who can also sing. I heard the blind artist couple singing "Miss Kong Er's Wedding" and "Foot Binding Scene," singing and reciting dialogue, one playing the mother and one playing the daughter, performing very movingly. The masses said, "We who have eyes are not as good as those who don't! They sing so well!" The remaining artists can all sing. Under the leadership of the meritorious artist Shen Guanying, they have composed many storytelling pieces, such as "Land Reform," "Li Er Gets Rich," "The Great Battle of Yanghu," "Persuading Compatriots," "Old Chiang Recognizes a Godfather," and "Ma Changzhai," etc. Needless to say, as soon as these storytelling pieces with new content are sung to the masses, they can immediately accept them, believing that these stories are about real people and real events, and about characters that the masses love and characters that they hate. They have created and performed characters familiar to the masses, their emotions have been comforted and stimulated, and the masses' thoughts have also been enlightened, further strengthening their hatred of landlords and bullies and their love for heroes and role models. In particular, Hei San, a well-known artist in the area, composed a segment called "Attacking Yanggu," which all happened in the past two or three years. The masses listened to each sentence, moved and praised each sentence, "That's right, it's all true events on our land!" the masses discussed. They all remembered the facts of the traitor Er Jinling killing and harming the people; they also remembered the facts of the Eighth Route Army attacking Yanggu and saving the people. Hei San doesn't know how to read, but he can add his own experience to the story of attacking Yanggu - he was arrested by Er Jinling and spent more than a month in Yanggu prison. He is very familiar with the crimes of the traitors, and when he composes and sings them, they are also very moving. If it is said that only the creation of the masses themselves can meet the requirements of the masses, this work aptly illustrates this principle.
    3. Yangqin Group: There are more than ten artists, one person playing the yangqin, with a huqin and a four-stringed instrument harmonizing, and another person playing the rhythm. The sound of the instruments alone attracts the masses. When played, there are clear and distinct sounds, joyful tunes and sorrowful sounds, which are very suitable for rural women to listen to. The content of the yangqin is suitable for singing storytelling pieces. If there are long-form folk stories and historical stories, it will be even more popular with the masses if they can sing for three or five days. Unfortunately, such works have not yet been created. The content they are currently singing is the same as the content sung by the Storytelling with Drum Accompaniment Group.
    4. Music Group: There are more than ten artists, some of whom can play the sheng, some can play the flute, some can play the drum board, some can play the gong, some can play the huqin, some can play the four-stringed instrument, some can play the small cymbals, and some can sing, sing ditties, and sing operas. When they play together, they can unleash the power of music. They can play "Chairman Mao is the Sun," "Song Celebrating the Anniversary of the Communist Party," folk ditties, and ancient Chinese famous songs, such as "Three Variations on Plum Blossoms" and "Little Open Door," which is popular among the people. In order to inspire the masses, they collectively created "The Great Counteroffensive." In addition to participating in some dialogues and singing, they completely use instruments to express the military and civilian emotions of the large army marching south, crossing the Yellow River, and fighting the Chiang Kai-shek army. Individual performances are even more surprising and moving. One artist can use the huqin to play various opera excerpts, such as old male roles, young female roles, a cappella, and recitations. Even the sounds of gongs and drums can be played. When performing in Kangyuan, he played "Fen River," with men and women singing in duet, just like real people speaking and singing. Another artist can use the flute to play various opera excerpts and songs, which sound the same as human voices. The masses listened and repeatedly shouted "Bravo!" and applauded continuously.
    The creativity of the artists is truly amazing. We should value this creativity and promote this creativity. One cadre, after listening to their performances, excitedly said to me, "Only the blind can't see this creation, and only the deaf can't hear it!" In terms of merit, the efforts they have made in propaganda work are worthy of praise and should be praised. Their components are mostly tenant farmers, poor people, apprentices, and workers. Because they could not withstand the oppression of landlords and capitalists, they wanted to learn to sing, play, and learn to make a living. Some were physically disabled and had no way to live, so they ran out to learn to play and sing. Their class consciousness is very strong, and their spirit of ideological transformation and learning is very strong and persistent. They first sing the things they have composed with their companions, and then sing them with the masses. They hope to receive comments, and as long as they are pointed out, they immediately make very good corrections. A storytelling piece or a yangqin piece is often revised and sung again and again; sung and revised again and again, until the masses can understand it, love to listen to it, and are moved by it, only then is it completed. Naturally, in today's works spoken and written by them, there are still old traditions, old tunes, and old words, but if they continue to improve and continue to create, they will definitely write better works, and these works will be widely and rapidly spread among the masses.
