[This newspaper's dispatch from the Jilu豫 region on the 8th] A certain local guerrilla unit, fighting valiantly behind enemy lines south of the Yellow River against Chiang Kai-shek’s forces, has repeatedly crushed the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" and "mopping-up" operations. Since May, their battle achievements have been remarkable, earning the praise of the military and civilians throughout the region. In five months, the unit engaged in 47 major battles, killing, wounding, and capturing a total of 1,342 enemy soldiers, averaging nine enemy casualties per day. They seized 1,348 long and short guns, three light and heavy machine guns, 20 various cannons, over 30,000 rounds of ammunition, over 1,000 bombs, 4,600 various cannon shells, 40 mules and horses, one repair machine, one radio station, over 300,000 yuan in legal currency, 24 bicycles, over 4,000 catties of wheat, 2,300 catties of rice, and many other items. In the Fanlaojia ambush on January 16, they captured alive Zhang Lanfeng, commander of the Chiang-appointed Henan Security Fourth Column, and over 60 others. On the night of March 5, combat hero Guo Wenqi and his assault team broke through the famous feudal fortress of Lvyuanzi in southwestern Shandong, capturing Huang Dadu, deputy commander of the Chiang-appointed "Henan People's Self-Defense Eighth Column," and over 200 others. On May 27, when the Chiang's regular army 429th Regiment was conducting "encirclement and suppression" and "mopping-up" operations in Weiwan, they were fiercely counterattacked by the unit and fled in disarray, with a total of over 250 enemy soldiers annihilated. We also captured three heavy machine guns, three light machine guns, and 35 rifles. The unit's performance in safeguarding the interests of the people has been astonishing, and it has now been promoted to a main force unit.
