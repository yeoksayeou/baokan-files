Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Hebei, Shandong and Henan, 9th: General Liu Bocheng's army, crossing southward, in a fierce battle lasting nine hours on the night of the 8th, forcefully captured Yuncheng on the southern bank of the Yellow River, eliminating the headquarters of the Kuomintang army's 55th Division, along with its 74th and 29th Brigades, as well as local bandits and "Home Return Corps." According to preliminary statistics, approximately 8,000 Kuomintang officers and soldiers were captured, and approximately 2,000 were killed or wounded, totaling over 11,000. Military supplies seized are piled up like mountains and are currently being inventoried. Yuncheng is the northernmost stronghold of the Kuomintang army on the southern bank of the Yellow River, used for sabotaging the restoration of the dyke project and stationing troops, and it serves as an advanced position for Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to invade the northern bank, making it strategically important. This is the fourth town recovered by General Liu's forces since crossing the river a week ago, following Juancheng, Juye, and Caoxian.

Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Hebei, Shandong and Henan, 7th (Delayed): General Liu Bocheng's army, crossing southward, recovered Juye City on the 6th; a portion of the Kuomintang army's 70th Division fled in panic. The enemy in Caoxian, Sun Xingzhai's unit of the 23rd Brigade of the 11th Administrative Office of Shandong Province, with more than 600 men, also fled upon hearing the news, and Caoxian City was also liberated.

    渡河南下大军旗开得胜
    攻克郓城歼敌万余
    钜野曹县两城亦告光复
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线九日电】刘伯承将军麾下南渡大军，于八日夜以九小时激战，强攻克复黄河南岸之郓城，消灭蒋军五十五师师部和该师七十四、二十九两个旅，及当地土顽和“还乡团”。据初步统计：生俘蒋军官兵约八千余人，毙伤约两千余人，共计约一万一千余人。缴获军需堆集如山，正进行清查中。按郓城系黄河南岸蒋军破坏复堤工程及屯兵之最北重镇，并为蒋介石企图进犯北岸的前进阵地，在战略形势上十分重要。此为刘将军所部渡河一周以来继鄄城、钜野、曹县后收复的第四座城镇。
    【新华社冀鲁豫前线七日电】（迟到）刘伯承将军麾下南渡大军，于六日收复钜野城；该城蒋军七十师一部，仓惶逃窜。曹县之敌山东第十一专署保安二十三旅孙性斋部六百余人，亦闻风逃窜，曹县城遂亦告光复。）
