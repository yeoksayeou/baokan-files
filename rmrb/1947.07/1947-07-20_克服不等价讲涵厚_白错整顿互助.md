    [This newspaper dispatch] Overcome Inequality, Emphasize Generosity, Correct Mistakes, Rectify and Help Each Other
    [This newspaper dispatch] The mutual aid teams in Baicuo Village, Shahe, were initially formed by administrative order. Superficially, they worked together, but in reality, they were not in harmony. The deputy village chief bought a new well rope, and the director of the farmers' association and his group kept damaging it. The deputy village chief, afraid of being called selfish, just smiled and said, "If it's broken, everyone will suffer a little, so it's better not to use it." He wanted to buy a rake, but no one would help him buy it. Even after he bought it, others used it carelessly, and it was not known who had it last. The labor of people and livestock was also unequal. Good and bad livestock were both compensated at five catties of rice per day, so everyone wanted to use the good livestock, and no one wanted to use the bad livestock. The household that fed the good livestock said they were committing a sin and that it would be better to exchange it for a bad one. People also did not work according to the strength of their labor. Some people worked quickly on their own land but either worked slowly on other people's land or sent a child to take their place. For example, Mao Chengguang wanted others to work for him first because, as a turned-over peasant, he felt the middle peasants should do more work for him. Due to the above reasons, not only was the mutual aid team not doing well, but it also affected the development of production and prosperity. The leadership specifically convened a meeting of cadres and activists for discussion. Everyone expressed their innermost thoughts and reviewed the past problems. They then went to various teams to mobilize the members to examine their actions and decided to formulate a system of "fixed points, flexible use" based on the strength of labor and the amount of work done and diligently kept accounts. The militiamen also held separate meetings to discuss how to play a model role within each team. Now all the mutual aid teams are undergoing rectification. (Shahe Organize Small Newspaper)
    [This newspaper dispatch from Taiyue, 18th] The mutual aid teams in Chaijia Village, Jinggou, Nanping, Xiagou, and other natural villages belonging to the Shanyuan base point village in Wangwu District once completely collapsed. The few that had not disbanded also had many disputes because the cadres did not participate in mutual aid and demanded preferential treatment. The mutual aid team leaders did not know how to keep accounts, so everyone called the mutual aid teams "muddled teams." After the cadres reviewed and reflected, they proposed launching a "four hearts" movement: 1. Determine to lead the village in mutual aid production in the future; 2. Humbly accept the opinions of the masses; 3. Carefully record points and work, and implement a work ticket system; 4. Patiently lead everyone in long-term mutual aid. The next day, they each returned to their villages and began to restore and rectify the situation. Xiagou proposed that accounts must be cleared, wages must be paid, and mutual aid must be persisted in. Not only were they reorganized, but they were also expanded. The Shanyuan team solved the problem of equal exchange and absorbed women and children to participate. Before the rectification, there were a total of twenty-two teams in the entire base point village. After the rectification, the number increased to thirty-two, and the number of participants had increased to more than 70%. The team leaders said with great confidence: "As long as the village cadres participate, we will have a way."

    克服不等价讲涵厚
    白错整顿互助
    【本报讯】沙河白错村的互助组，开始是行政命令编起来的，表面上在一起干，但实际上不对心思，副村长买了一条新井绳，农会主任组一直轮着使坏了，副村长怕人说自私，只是笑了笑，说：“坏了大家都受点难为吧，都不用好了。”他要买耙，谁也不给他伙买，但他买下了别人仍是乱使，也不知传到谁家了。人和牲口的劳力也不等价，好坏牲口拉一套都是五斤米，结果都想用好牲口，赖牲口没人用，喂好牲口户说造下罪了，不如换个坏的。人也不按劳力好坏，一对一天的干，好些人到自己地干的急，到别人地不是干的慢，就是去个小孩顶。又如毛成光想让别人先给他干，中农应当多给他干（他是翻身户）。由于以上原因，不但互助组搞不好，还影响了生产致富的发展，领导上就专门召开了个干部积极分子会进行讨论，大家都说出了自己的心思话，对过去问题作了检讨，他们又到各个组发动组员检讨，决定按劳力的强弱、做活的多少，订成死分活用办法，并勤算帐。民兵们又单独开会讨论，在各组内先起模范作用。现在所有互助组正在进行整顿中。（沙河组织起来小报）
    【本报太岳十八日电】王屋一区山院基点村所属柴家庄、井沟、南平、下沟等自然村的互助组一度全部垮台，少数未散伙的，也是纠纷很多，原因是干部不参加互助，并要大家优待，互助组长不会计工算帐，大家都叫互助组为“糊涂组”，经干部检讨反省后，提出开展“四心”运动；一、今后决心领导全村互助生产；二、虚心接受群众意见；三、细心记分计工实行工票制度；四、耐心领导大家长期互助。第二日各自回到庄上，动手恢复整顿，下沟提出算帐一定要算清，工资一定要得，互助一定要坚持，不仅重新组织起来，并且扩大了。山院小组解决了等价交换问题，吸收妇女儿童参加。整顿前全基点村共有二十二个小组，整顿后即增加到三十二个，参加人数已增至百分之七十以上，小组长都很有信心的说：“只要有村干部参加，咱们就有办法”。
