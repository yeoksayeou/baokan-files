　　"Little Cao Village Was Saved by the Communist Party"
    Li An
    Handan's Cao Village is a small village with fewer than six hundred people. For thousands of years, it has been shrouded in hunger, cold, poverty. Except for the five Zhang, four Wang, and several landlord families, 90% of the people rely on pushing small carts, pulling rickshaws, scraping small amounts of salt, and carrying large pieces at the train station to earn a bowl of rice. Whether it was before the War of Resistance, during the Chiang Kai-shek's rule, or during the Japanese occupation, they found it difficult to make a living. They frowned all day long, worrying about food and clothing for their families. How much money could they earn by carrying large pieces? How much could they earn by pushing a small cart? How could pulling a rickshaw solve the family's livelihood? Scraping small amounts of salt and boiling saltpeter was considered illegal in the past, so they lived in pain 360 days a year.
    In order not to starve to death, they secretly scraped a little salt-rich soil. They didn't dare to put the leached brine in the open. They would put it here and hide it there. They didn't dare to put the brine in large vats, only in small basins and bowls, and hide them under the bed, in the toilet, in the haystack... They only dared to secretly boil it with small pots late at night and secretly sell it for a few coins.
    However, the rulers, whether they were Japanese, puppet troops, Chiang Kai-shek, landlords, or local bullies, were all the same. They sent salt patrolmen to inspect, several times a day. When they saw people scraping salt-rich soil and the small carts they pushed, they would break the carts and take the people away, detaining them. If they found large pots or vats with salt in their homes, they would either smash them or break them. If they found anyone with equipment for leaching salt, they would definitely take the house owner away. Under these circumstances, these people had no choice but to endure hunger and cold and sit and wait for death.
    They had been oppressed for too long, and even after liberation, they still did not dare to scrape salt-rich soil. Starting last winter, when some people scraped soil, the government not only did not prohibit it, but also allowed them to scrape it everywhere. Those who scraped it were even rewarded. Those who had no money could get an advance. Every time the public came to buy saltpeter, they paid first. As a result, more and more people scraped small amounts of salt every day. This spring, all the men, women, old, and young in the village participated.
    Every day, before dawn, they heard the creaking sound of "scraping soil." As soon as the sun came out, they saw small carts full of salt-rich soil continuously creaking their way back. Adults and children wore new clothes and ate thick millet porridge. Old Man Dan said, "Don't even mention calling us to turn over, taking back the things the landlords exploited and returning the land to the owners and wealth to the home! Just allowing us to scrape small amounts of salt and boil saltpeter is enough for us to turn over, have clothes to wear, and have food to eat. In the old days, we weren't even free to engage in our own production to take care of our lives. We had to secretly scrape a little salt and still be beaten and detained. No wonder everyone says Chairman Mao is our savior! He cherishes the people like parents." He packed a pipe and said, "I am an old hand at scraping soil in this village, and only this year have I benefited so much. It's just that Chiang Kai-shek's old boy is unlucky! Just this spring, we produced more than 8,000 catties of saltpeter. How many hand grenades can that make? It's really time for the poor to turn over!" Eight thousand catties of saltpeter are worth 2 million yuan. In addition to saltpeter, 10,000 catties of small salt can be boiled, worth 800,000 to 900,000 yuan. This income has indeed solved many problems.
    One day, Old Mother Tang said, "I really couldn't make it in the past. The devils wouldn't let me spin and weave, and they wouldn't let me scrape salt. We were so hungry that we had no choice but to go to the train station to sweep up the grain that people dropped, pick up coal, and beg for food. I was so hungry all day that I couldn't walk. I secretly scraped a little salt, and the salt patrolmen saw it, ran to my house, broke my basin, and broke my pot. They insisted on detaining me. I kowtowed to them, and they beat me again before they let me go. Now, if I see a salt patrolman, I'll bite off two pieces of his flesh to vent my anger!" She paused and said with emotion: "The Communist Party is really good! You are so kind to us, you let us turn over here, scraping small amount of salt, not to mention me, even my grandson of Old Tang can't forget Chairman Mao, and the cadres of the liberated area! For our Little Cao Village, who wasn't saved by the Communist Party."

　　“小曹庄叫共产党救活了”
    黎暗
    邯郸曹庄是一个不满六百人口的小村，几千年来被饿寒穷困所笼罩着，——除五张四王几家地主外，百分之九十是依靠推小车、拉洋车、刮小盐、在车站上扛大件来赚碗饭吃的人。他们不论在抗战前，蒋介石统治时代，或日寇统治时代，都是很难维持生活的，他们或她们整天皱着眉头发愁家中的吃穿，扛大件能赚几个钱？推小车能挣多少钱？拉洋车又怎能解决家庭的生活呢？刮小盐熬火硝在过去又是犯私，因此他们一年三百六十天是在痛苦中过活。
    他们为了不饿死，偷偷的刮一点盐土，淋下的盐水不敢放在明处，这放放、那藏藏，盐水不敢盛在缸里，只有盛在小盆里、小碗里，再藏在床底下，厕所里、草堆里……………等到深夜才敢偷偷的用小锅熬，偷偷的卖几个钱。
    然而统治者，不管日本人、伪军、蒋介石、地主恶霸他们都一样，派盐巡来检查，一天不知来检查几遍，看到刮盐土的人，和他们推的小车，就把小车碰坏，把人带走，扣起来。到家中检查到大锅大缸有盐，不是砸坏，就是打碎，发现谁家有淋小盐的淋子，一定把房主带走。这种情况下，这些人是一点办法都没有的，唯有忍饥挨寒，坐以待毙。
    他们受压迫太久了，解放后，仍不敢刮盐土。从去年冬有人刮土政府不但不禁止，而且允许他们到处去刮，刮的人还奖励，没有钱的可以早些支钱，每次公家来买硝时先给钱。这样一来刮小盐的，一天天多起来，今春全村的男女老少都参加了。
    每天，天还未明，就听到吱啊吱啊的“刮土”声，太阳刚出来就看见满载盐土的小车，连续不断的吱扭吱扭叫唤着回来了。大人孩子身上穿的是新衣，吃的是捞小米干饭，耽老头说：“不用说还叫俺们翻身，把老财剥削的东西要回来，叫土地归主钱财回家啦！就光叫刮小盐熬火硝，我们就是翻了身，就有衣穿，有饭吃了。过去的世道俺们连自己搞生产来顾生活都不自由，偷偷刮点盐还得挨打，被扣，怪不得人人说毛主席是救星哩！真象爹娘一样的惜民呵”。他装了一袋烟又说：“我是这村刮土的老手，只有今年得利大，也该蒋介石老小子倒霉哩！光今春出火硝八千斤还多，这能做多少手榴弹？真该穷人翻身了！”八千斤硝值二百万元，除硝外还可熬出小盐一万斤，值八九十万元，这一笔进款确实解决了不少问题。
    有一天老唐娘说：“俺过去真没办法过，纺花织布鬼子不叫，刮盐不叫，我们就饿的没法，只有到车站上扫人家掉的土粮食，拾煤块，讨饭吃。整天饿的我走不动，我偷刮了点小盐，叫盐巡看见了，跑到我家把盆也打破了，锅也打了，非扣起我来不行，我给人家叩头，人家又打了我一顿，才算完。现在叫我见到盐巡了，娘的屄非咬他两口肉才泄?蓿?炒逅?话す?窝驳拇颍克?皇芄??≈挥姓偶液屯跫颐挥惺芄??阆胗谐缘乃?ナ苷庵志?拢肯衷诮夥徘?攘税城钊耍?嫉昧嗣?飨??恩，您在这里叫俺翻身，刮小盐，不用说我，以后叫俺老唐的孙子也不能忘了毛主席，和解放区的干部啦！就是俺小曹庄，谁不是叫共产党救活了。”
