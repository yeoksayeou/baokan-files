Tunliu Shanglian Base Point
Not Relaxing Frugality Due to Rain
[This newspaper's Taiyue 16th dispatch] The Shanglian base point in Tunliu and five joint villages in Luocun are not relaxing frugality due to the rain. After the heavy rain on the 21st of last month at the Shanglian base point, the mutual aid groups of Ma Zhuang's labor model @ Baoze and Hejialing's labor hero Chen Fuqiu still ate cornmeal porridge in the morning (each dou of corn mixed with three sheng of bran). They did not eat dry rice for lunch, and drank rice soup in the evening without eating vegetables. They put forward the slogan of "no lights at night, no haircuts when going to town," and also gathered more than 120 jin of dried vegetables. The cadres and labor heroes of the five joint villages in Luocun, such as Guo Yudui, took advantage of the rain to lead the masses to eliminate 308 mu of overgrown wasteland, with each person planting two fen of vegetables.

    屯留上莲基点
    不因落雨放松节约
    【本报太岳十六日电】屯留上莲基点及罗村五个联村，不因落雨而放松节约。上莲基点上月二十一日大雨后，马庄劳动模范＠豹则、贺家岭劳动英雄陈富秋等互助组，还是早上吃玉茭面＠（每斗玉茭掺三升糠）。晌午不吃干饭，晚上喝米汤，不吃菜。提出：“黑夜不点灯，上街不剃头”的口号，并打下干菜一百二十多斤。罗村五个联村干部劳动英雄郭玉堆等，更趁雨领导群众消灭熟荒三百零八亩，每人种菜二分。
