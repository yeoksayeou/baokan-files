Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 18th. During the battle to liberate Taian on the 8th, the East China People's Liberation Army maintained strict discipline. The battle concluded before dusk on that day, and order within the city was restored by 8 a.m. The Second Company of a certain unit, which was the first to enter the city, meticulously distinguished between Kuomintang-puppet materials and civilian materials when searching for hidden Chiang Kai-shek and puppet soldiers and confiscating military equipment. A certain squad publicized the liberation policy, and residents voluntarily offered two telephone machines hidden by Chiang's army. A certain platoon leader personally led soldiers to the home of a "Homecoming Corps" member who had hidden guns, persuading the gun-hiding household to hand over the guns voluntarily. The Second Battalion pursued the enemy to the vicinity of the railway station and took good care of the travelers and goods in the hotels. Merchants expressed their gratitude repeatedly. Platoon Leader Zhang Wenlu educated everyone with the idea that "personal advantage is a small matter, but the impact of the People's Army is a big matter," advocating fair buying and selling. The citizens unanimously praised: The People's Liberation Army does not violate even the slightest thing.

Xinhua News Agency, East China Front, 18th. While the People's Liberation Army was besieging Feixian with intense artillery fire, it also launched widespread frontline appeals to the enemy. A group of new and old liberated soldiers, along with a deputy company commander and a platoon leader who had just been liberated from Zhongluo Mountain, began shouting at the Kuomintang army's outposts, about 50 to 60 meters away. At first, the Kuomintang army fired sporadic cold shots.

"Don't shoot, I am a deputy company commander of the 38th Brigade, who came from Zhongluo Mountain." The cold shots stopped, and the Kuomintang soldiers whispered among themselves.

"It doesn't matter if officers come over, let's talk about home!" The deputy company commander who had just been liberated continued to shout, "What good is it to be cannon fodder for Chiang Kai-shek? Come over here, and you will all be treated with preferential treatment. We have very good equipment here. What good is your Hanyang-made rifle?"

Then, the soldiers who had been liberated in the previous battles of Zaozhuang and Menglianggu shouted: "I am from the 51st Division, and even the fortifications as solid as Zaozhuang were broken." "I was from the 74th Division with fully American equipment, and as a result, we were wiped out. What way out is there for you to keep fighting with these Hanyang-made rifles?" "Here, officers and soldiers are equal, and the people treat us very well. Come over here!" The Kuomintang soldiers listened intently. An officer ordered them to shoot, but they fired two shots into the air and then stopped.

From the Kuomintang soldiers' speech, many people heard a Liyang accent. Instructor Zhou Min crawled closer and shouted in the Liyang dialect: "Think about when the New Fourth Army was in Jiangnan, we had food and clothing. When Chiang Kai-shek came, countless exorbitant taxes were levied, and men were drafted to die for him. We are all fellow villagers from Jiangnan. Come over here quickly!" The Kuomintang soldiers remained silent.

The People's Liberation Army's attack continued to develop. Soon, the 38th Brigade headquarters was surrounded.

The Kuomintang army stationed in the residence shouted for help: "We can't get out! The doors and windows are sealed with barbed wire and mud bricks." "Throw the weapons out of the window first!" So bundles of Hanyang-made revolvers were immediately thrown out of the window. The People's Liberation Army, while collecting the spoils of war, opened the blocked windows and doors to release the Kuomintang officers and soldiers.

　　泰安攻城战中我军纪律严明
    【新华社华东前线十八日电】华东解放军于八日解放泰安战斗中，部队纪律严明。是日拂晚前结束战斗，上午八时，城内秩序即已恢复。最先入城之某部二连，在搜查潜藏蒋伪，收缴军用器材时，连干部亲自掌握严格区别蒋伪物资与民用物资，井然有序。某班宣传解放政策，居民自动献出蒋军匿藏的两部电话机。某部三排长亲率战士至一“还乡团”藏枪之家，说服存枪户自动将枪交出。二营追敌至车站附近，对旅馆中旅客与货物，均善为保护。商旅称谢不绝。排长张文禄以“个人占便宜事小，人民军队的影响事大”来教育大家公买公卖。市民们一致称赞：解放军真是秋毫无犯。
    【新华社华东前线十八日电】解放军在以强烈炮火围攻费县的同时，普遍展开了火线对敌喊话。一批新老解放战士和刚从钟罗山被解放的蒋军一个副连长与一个排长，在离蒋军前哨五六十米达的地方开始喊话。起初蒋军还打冷枪。
    “不要打枪，我是三十八旅的一个副连长，在钟罗山过来的。”冷枪停止了，蒋军们在窃窃私话。
    “当官的过来也不要紧，我们谈谈家常吧！”那位刚解放过来的副连长继续喊话，“替蒋介石当炮灰有什么好处？过这边来，一律受优待。这边装备很好，咱们的汉阳造管啥用？”
    接着，前枣庄战役和孟良崮战役先后解放的战士喊话了：“我是五十一师的，枣庄那样坚固的工事也给攻破了”“我是七十四的完全美械装备，结果被消灭了，你们这些汉阳造再打下去有什么出路？”“这里官兵平等，老百姓待我们很好，过来吧！”蒋军士兵们听得出神，一个军官命令他们打枪，他们对空打了两枪，就不打了。
    从蒋军士兵的说话中，听到溧阳人口音很多，指导员周民爬近去，用溧阳土话叫喊：“你们想想新四军在江南时，我们有吃有穿，蒋介石来了，数不尽的苛捐杂税还要抽丁给他送死，我们都是江南老乡，快过来吧！”蒋军士兵听了都默默无语。
    解放军的攻击继续发展，一会儿，三十八旅旅部被包围住了。
    蒋军驻宅内喊出了求救的呼声：“我们出不来呀！门窗都被铁刺和泥砖封销住了。”“先把武器从窗口里摔下来呀！”于是一捆捆的汉阳造左轮立即从窗口摔了出来，解放军一面收拾胜利品，一面打开被堵塞的窗门放出蒋军官兵。
