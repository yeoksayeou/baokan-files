[This article was transmitted by] This newspaper's Hebei-Shandong-Henan dispatch on the 17th: The Nanwang Guerrilla Area correctly implemented the policy of "holding a gun in one hand and distributing land in the other." In the tense guerrilla environment, the land reform movement was universally launched. In the three districts south of the slope alone, 100 villages have initially completed land reform, with a total of more than 10,400 people receiving land and grain. The area was first entered village by village by the district's armed work team. When the enemy came, they fought; when the enemy left, they distributed land. They used administrative power to control landlords. After the situation was opened, they unleashed bold action, adopting joint actions by small area masses, organizing joint action committees, and assigning tasks to mobilize people. With mutual influence between villages, the momentum was great, dispelling concerns, breaking ties with landlords, and taking bold action. In many backward villages, during the joint struggle, the masses' awareness was raised and the stagnant situation was broken. After the masses distributed land and grain, they recognized the landlords' past deceptive methods and exposed the "Ganzi Hui" (special agent organization). During the struggle, some cadres commented that the struggle was excessive, fearing that it would trigger a riot by the "Ganzi Hui" organized by the landlords. However, the movement proved that only by thoroughly defeating the landlords and making the peasants recognize the landlords' crimes could the "Ganzi Hui" be fundamentally eradicated.

    【本报冀鲁豫十七日电】南旺游击区，正确的执行了一手拿枪一手分田的方针，在紧张游击环境中土地改革运动普遍展开，仅坡南三个区，已有一百个村初步完成土地改革，计有一万零四百余人分得土地和粮食。该区首先由区武工队进一村作一村，敌人来到就打仗，敌人走了就分田，并以行政力量控制地主，局面打开后，放手大干，采取小区群众联合行动，组织联合行动委员会，分头掌握动员，各村群众在互相影响之下，声势甚大，打破了顾虑，与地主撕破脸，大干起来。有许多落后村在联合斗争中，群众觉悟提高，消沉局面亦打开。群众在分过土地粮食后，认清了地主过去的欺骗手法，将“杆子会”（特务组织）揭穿。在进行斗争中，曾有某些干部评论斗争过火，怕引起地主所组织之“杆子会”暴动，但运动证明，只有彻底斗透地主，使农民认清地主罪恶，才是根绝“杆子会”的基本办法。
