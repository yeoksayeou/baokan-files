　　History Village, Changzhi
  　Human Effort Triumphs Over Disaster
  　Replenished Seedlings After Hailstorm Sprout Over Thousands of Mu
    [Our Changzhi Dispatch] After the hailstorm on July 13th in History Village, First District, the masses initially felt pessimistic, and most did not treat replanting as a major task. Some only replanted a small number of garden plots near the village. Therefore, a meeting was convened with 33 cadres and above, including group leaders, to discuss the matter. Some said: "The soil is hard and dry, and the seedlings won't sprout." Others said, "It's like spilling oil from a large jar and trying to scrape it off an ant's leg; replanting won't make much difference." Mutual aid team leader Wang Mi only said: "We've already plowed under the land that was damaged beyond recovery, planning to plant wheat in August. Even if we plant now and get a few seeds, it won't be enough to cover the burden." After discovering these ideas, the leadership emphasized the seriousness and prevalence of this year's drought and presented an introduction to the drought conditions in the surrounding counties. After a heated discussion, everyone recalled the hardships of famine years and recounted many sorrowful events. They recognized the importance of replanting. Wang Mi then came around, saying: "Waiting to plant wheat on the plowed land will mean going hungry, waiting a whole year. We can't do that kind of thing. If we plant more radishes and vegetables, they can be a great help when we have nothing to eat next spring."
    Jiao Sihai said: "I didn't eat for three days during the famine year. I picked some leaves from trees, but they were so bitter I could only eat half a bowl. If we plant some carrots and turnips, we won't have to suffer that pain! I have one mu of garden land that I plan to plant with carrots to survive the famine, and I will replant the six and a half mu of land damaged by the hailstorm with buckwheat and millet." Feng Gennv said: "Planting and saving one mu is one mu saved, planting and saving one plant is one plant saved. If we don't replant, there will be nothing to eat next spring when the old crops are gone and the new ones haven't come in yet. That would truly be a hopeless situation." After such a heated discussion, everyone discussed the severity of the disaster in each plot of land and came up with specific replanting methods: according to the actual situation, the land that was damaged beyond recovery would be plowed and sown with millet, buckwheat, and mung beans; the seedlings that could be revived would be preserved as much as possible, and the bare ground where the seedlings had died would be replenished with buckwheat and mung beans. For land with twenty to thirty percent of the harvest remaining, some red and white radishes and turnips would be planted. Gardens should be watered as much as possible, and more red and white radishes should be planted. The daily wage for mutual aid teams was originally set at five sheng of millet. During the replanting period, in order to address the difficulty of providing millet for households without labor, a discussion was held to exchange labor, replanting now and returning the labor by spinning or doing other work later.
    After the discussion, it was decided that replanting would be carried out by mutual aid teams. Each of the ten groups in the village was assigned one or two cadres to personally lead the work. After mobilizing the groups, more than 300 men, women, and children were organized from the village. From the 16th to the 20th, over five days, the 170 mu of autumn land that had been damaged were plowed and completely sown, and the severely damaged crops were replanted with millet, radishes, and buckwheat. A total of more than 1,000 mu were replanted and re-sown. Now the tobacco leaves have all been replanted and are thriving, and the seeds have successively emerged from the soil. Currently, efforts are being made to organize soil covering. (Yaohua, Liangshan, Hulin, Liangbi)

  　人力胜灾荒
  　雹后补种千亩小苗已经出土
    【本报长治讯】一区史家庄于七月十三日下冰雹后，群众开始很悲观，大部分没把补种当成件大事来做，有的只补种村边的少数园地，于是就召集小组长以上干部三十三人开会研究，有的说：地皮又硬又干出不来了，有的说大缸冲倒了油，在蚂蚁腿上刮哩，补种上也顶不了个用。互助组长王迷只说：“打得没收成的地，我们已经干脆犁转啦，计划到八月种麦，凡正现在种上打几颗，也是不够出负担啦。”发现这些思想后，领导上向大家提出了认识今年荒旱的严重性与普遍性，并把周围几县的旱情，作了个介绍，经过热烈讨论，大家又回忆起灾荒年的生活了，访出了许多伤心事情。认识了补种的重要，王迷只想通了说：“犁转的地上等种麦，还得饿上肚，整整等一年，咱可不办那种事情，萝卜菜多种上些，到明春没吃时，也能顶大用。”
    焦四孩说：“我在灾荒年三天没有吃饭，采了些树叶回去，苦的只吃了半碗，如果要种些红萝卜菜，还用受那罪！我有一亩园地计划种成红萝卜叫渡荒吃，再把冷雨敲坏的六亩半地改种上荞麦糜黍。”冯根女说：“种活一亩算一亩，种活一根算一根，补种不上到明春青黄不接没吃的，那可真是没有办法。”经过这样热烈讨论，大家就把各块地的灾情轻重谈了一下，讨论出了具体的补种办法：根据实际情况，打的没有收成的用犁翻下一律种上糜黍、荞麦、绿豆，有一二分收成的尽量把能复活的苗留下，把死了苗的空地都补成荞麦、绿豆。有二三分以上收成的补种些红白萝卜、菜根等。园地尽量拨水浇，多栽红白萝卜。互助组每日工资小米原决定为五升，在补种期间，为了照顾没劳力户的出米困难，讨论了变工办法，补种后来给纺花或做其他活还工。
    讨论后决定以互助小组为单位来进行补种，全村十个组，各组都配备了一个至两个干部，亲自动手领导着干。经过小组下去动员，全村共组织起男人妇女儿童三百余人，自十六日起到二十日，经五天工夫，把被打坏的一百七十亩秋地，翻转全部下了种，受伤厉害的庄稼全部补种上了糜黍、萝卜、荞麦。共计改种补种一千余亩，现在烟叶已全部栽活，种子已先后吐出地皮，现正全力组织搂地。（耀华、良善、虎林、良弼）
