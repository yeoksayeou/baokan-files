Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Urgent Telegram, 29th: The encircled Chiang troops at Yangshanji, north of Jinxiang, have been completely annihilated. This includes the 66th Division headquarters and its directly subordinate units, as well as its 13th Brigade (minus the 38th Regiment) and the entire 185th Brigade. The results are currently being tallied. The 66th Division was known as Chen Cheng's trusted unit, comprising three brigades. Its entire 199th Brigade and the 38th Regiment of the 13th Brigade were already annihilated on July 22nd in the outer perimeter of Yangshanji. Thus, the entire division has been wiped out. The People's Liberation Army launched the general offensive at dusk on July 27th and concluded the battle at 8:00 AM on July 28th, lasting only twelve hours.

Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 29th: General Liu Bocheng's Field Headquarters has just released Public Notice No. 4, announcing the results of our army's blocking action against the Chiang troops attempting to relieve the siege of Yangshanji, north of Jinxiang, on July 22nd. In this battle, a total of over 5,200 Chiang troops were annihilated. This includes the complete annihilation of the Chiang army's 66th Division's 199th Brigade, the entire 38th Regiment of the 13th Brigade, and a portion of the 58th Division. The captured include Wang Shiqiao, Brigade Commander of the 199th Brigade; Wang Boyan, Deputy Regimental Commander of the 595th Regiment; Zheng Wenhao, Colonel Regimental Commander of the 38th Regiment of the 13th Brigade; Lou Xun, Major Deputy Regimental Commander; Li Zhenhan, Lieutenant Colonel Director of the News Office; and 2,224 other personnel. 3,000 enemy troops were killed or wounded, including Wang Hongshao, Deputy Chief of Staff of the 199th Brigade and Commander of the 596th Regiment. The captured materials include 1,220 rifles and pistols, 25 heavy machine guns, 155 light machine guns, 7 mortars, 18 60mm mortars, 44 portable machine guns, 4 radio stations, 160,000 rounds of ammunition, and a large quantity of other military supplies.

Xinhua News Agency, Frontlines of Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 29th: Frontline reporter Fang De reported on the capture of Wang Shiqiao, Brigade Commander of the Chiang army's 199th Brigade: When the brigade was encircled and annihilated by the People's Liberation Army on the night of July 22nd, Brigade Commander Wang Shiqiao immediately led a group of his trusted men to flee north. On the way, he was wounded on the upper right side of his head and was supported by a guard. Before long, they were scattered. Wang then hid alone in a sorghum field, tightly wrapping his head with a towel, exposing only his eyes, and inserting sorghum leaves all over his head, hoping not to be discovered. However, the sorghum field was extremely hot and stuffy, and he was also hungry. He had no choice but to come out again, carrying his rubber shoes, wading through knee-deep river water. At 2:00 PM, he encountered the People's Liberation Army north of Tiantun Village and said, "I am a sergeant clerk who escaped from Yangmen. Your artillery was so powerful last night that it injured my head. It would be better to be killed. It's really suffering to be half-dead like this!" As he spoke, tears streamed down his face. The People's Liberation Army took him to the back of the village and gave him a large basin of meat noodles, which Wang picked up and ate. On the way to the People's Liberation Army regiment headquarters after the meal, he repeatedly asked, "How is Li Shouzhen doing now? What about Liu Guangxin?..." The soldier escorting him immediately introduced him to the recent living conditions of captured Chiang army senior generals. Finally, he confessed with peace of mind that he was Wang Shiqiao.
