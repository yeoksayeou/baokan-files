　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 26th. The delayed June 14th edition of the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao carried a dispatch from its London correspondent, Li Xiushi, stating that Li had written to British Labour Party MPs who were concerned about the situation in China, seeking their opinions on the Chinese political situation. Among them, Hua Pei replied, saying that he most wanted to know "how much hope there is now in China to establish a central government that is completely based on democracy and encompasses all parties loyal to China and the ideals of the United Nations." When Scollon answered Li's inquiry, he said, "I do not believe that the Tripartite Mediation will succeed. I am deeply convinced that Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang are even more reactionary than Franco and his gang." Scollon further explained his understanding of the Chinese Communist Party: "I don't know what the Communists in China are like, but from the records of Snow and other works, I know that they give land to the people."

  　蒋比佛朗哥还反动
    【新华社陕北廿六日电】迟到之六月十四日上海大公报载该报伦敦特派员黎秀石通讯称：黎氏曾向关心中国时局之英国工党议员分别函询彼等对中国政局之意见，其中，华培回信称：他最想知道“中国现在有几分希望能够成立一个完全以民主政治为基础，并包罗一切忠于中国和联合国理想的政党的中央政府。”史可兰回答黎氏所询时，则称：“我不相信三国调解能够成功。我已深信蒋介名石与国民党比较佛朗哥那班人还反动。”史氏复说明对中国共产党之了解：“我不知道在中国的共产党员是怎样的，但从史诺和其他作品的记载中，我知道他们把土地交给人民。
