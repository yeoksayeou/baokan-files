　　New District North Tianhe Accepts Equivalent Policies
  　Reorganize Mutual Aid and Freely Form Groups
    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi] After North Tianhe rectified its mutual aid groups, commended production models, and resolved ideological concerns, it generally launched a wave of enthusiasm for getting rich. The cadres of North Tianhe did not conduct detailed research when organizing mutual aid groups, but relied on a burst of enthusiasm to divide all 235 households in the village (excluding the 22 households of landlords who were being struggled against) into 21 groups according to their residential locations. After announcing this at a meeting, they believed that everything was in order. In reality, the masses demanded voluntary association and opposed the assigned groupings. In addition, a large number of middle peasants were afraid to get rich due to fear of struggle, and the emancipated peasants had ideological concerns about heavy burdens, so they could not muster the energy for production. At the beginning of the spring plowing season, during the period of delivering manure and repairing land, with the exception of the Yao Zhenze and Song Mengcheng groups, most of the others did not get going. The cadres thought that the tense period of production had not yet arrived, and there was no need for mutual aid and great efforts. When the time came for a concentrated effort to plant seeds, it still did not work, especially the middle peasants whose production enthusiasm was the lowest. At this time, the cadres realized that the masses were dissatisfied with the assigned groupings and dared not get rich, but they still dared not let go and allow them to voluntarily associate, fearing that the situation would collapse and be difficult to manage. After explanation and mobilization, it was decided to let go and rectify. The cadres went deep into each group, organized mealtime meetings, and talked with the masses to understand the specific thoughts of those who dared not get rich and were dissatisfied with the assigned mutual aid. First, they put forward slogans such as "Middle and poor peasants are brothers, mutual aid production leads to a good life," and "Organizing mutual aid leads to great strength, two people can do the work of three, one person can save more than ten workdays a month, which is more than a hundred a year," etc. On one hand, cadres and activists carried out propaganda for production and getting rich, and organized heart-to-heart talks to break through ideological barriers. Middle peasant Song Mengcheng said, "I used to hear that after the struggle against the landlords, it would be the turn of the middle peasants, and my heart was always fluctuating up and down, and I dared not try to get rich. But it has been a long time since the struggle against the landlords, and I haven't seen any struggle against the middle peasants, and everyone says, 'Middle and poor peasants are brothers.' Now the people in my group have changed, and they are only thinking about getting rich. Wang Erluan is single-mindedly planning to buy a cotton gin and a spinning machine. Song Shuangfu plans to get a good mule to run a mill. I plan to go to the city tomorrow to buy a good mule for transportation. The whole group is very determined to cultivate three acres and have a surplus of one." After the middle peasants' concerns were dispelled, the emancipated peasants also came to understand the idea of ​​being afraid of burdens, and the vice chairman of the farmers' association asked to be allocated more land. As a result, everyone was vying for land. Talking about mutual aid, Han Manshui and Zhao Fuyuan said, "The people in the 21st group and the 4th group are working very hard, but the people in our 2nd team can't get along. We are like enemies when we meet, and we don't even talk to each other, so how can we help each other make money." Then many people clamored and proposed: "The mutual aid that is compiled can't be done, let's find objects that are like-minded." The cadres accepted the opinions of the masses and let them voluntarily combine and reorganize, and soon formed 15 groups, with a total of 169 households participating. A production leadership organization was also organized, and Feng Genzhi, the chairman of the farmers' association, was elected as the director of the mutual aid cooperative. The cooperative was divided into four sections: organization and coordination, technical research, publicity and education, and participation in the war and support of the front and transportation. At the same time, in order to adjust labor and facilitate leadership, each group automatically combined and divided into four mutual aid teams by street, stipulating the method of fixed division of labor and living scoring. Then Song Mengcheng, Zhao Guoji and other twelve people were selected as production models, recorded for great merit, and received commendation, so everyone's production enthusiasm was even greater. Each group extracted a large part of the labor force to organize sideline production such as transportation, oil extraction, water carrying, and coal pushing. The women concentrated on pulling rice seedlings; 162 women pulled 185.5 acres of rice in one day, and the 69-year-old widow grandmother pulled rice seedlings as well as a full laborer. Seven new mills, one shop, and one small production shop were also opened, and preparations were made to open a large oil mill, and two mules and one donkey were newly purchased, creating a lively scene, with every man and woman in every household not idle.

　　新区北天河接受等价政策
  　重整互助自由碰组
    【本报长治讯】北天河整顿互助组，表扬生产模范，解决思想顾虑后，普遍掀起发家热潮。北天河的干部们在组织互助组时没有详细研究，就凭着一股热情把全村二百三十五户（除下被斗地主二二户外），按住宅地盘编为二十一个小组。开会宣布后，就认为诸事妥当，实际上群众都要求自愿结合反对编制。另有大部中农怕斗争不敢发家，翻身农民怕负担重等思想顾虑，生产提不起劲。春耕开始，送粪修地时期，除姚贞则和宋孟成两组互助生产外，其余大都没有搞出来。干部们还以为没有到生产紧张的时候，用不着互助大干。到突击下种时，仍搞不起来，特别是中农生产情绪最低。这时干部才认识了群众不满编制，不敢发家，但仍不敢放手任其自愿结合，怕垮了台收拾不到一块。经过解释动员，才决定放手整顿。干部深入到各小组，组织饭场会，和群众谈心，了解到不敢发家不满按编制互助的具体思想。首先提出“中贫农是弟兄，互助生产过好光景。”“组织互助力量大，二人做了三人活，一人一月剩工十来个，一年就是一百多”等口号。一面干部积极分子展开生产发家宣传，组织谈心会，打通思想，中农宋孟成说：“我以前听到斗罢地主轮中农，心上时刻是忽上忽下的不敢闹发财。但斗罢地主多时了，也没见斗中农，大家又都说：“中贫农是弟兄。”现在我那组人已转变了，光是谋的闹发财，王二乱一心谋的买弹花机和纺织机，宋双富打算要头好叫驴开磨坊，我是明天就进城买头好骡搞运输。全组决心很大，要做到耕三余一。”中农顾虑解除后，翻身农民怕负担的思想也想通了，农会副主席要求再分他一些地，这一来大家都争着要地。谈到互助，韩满水和赵福元说：“人家二十一组和四组干的很吃劲，俺们二班人弄不到一块，见了面仇人一般，话都不说，那里还能互助赚钱呢。”接着好多人都吵吵嚷嚷的提出：“编起来的互助弄不成，心投意合各找对象吧。”干部接受了群众意见，放手任其自愿结合重新组织，很快就碰好了十五个小组，参加的共一六九户。又组织了生产领导机构，选农会主席冯根只为互助社长。社内分组织调剂、技术研究、宣教卫生、参战支差运输等四股。同时为了调剂劳力，便利领导，各组自动结合，以街分了四个互助队，订出死分活计，按生活评分的办法。接着宋孟成、赵过计等十二人就被选为生产模范，记了大功，得到表扬，于是大家生产劲头更大。各组抽出大部劳力组织运输、打油、挑水、推煤等副业生产。妇女们则突击拔谷苗；一六二个妇女一天拔谷一八五·五亩，傍家六十九岁的寡妇老奶奶拔谷还顶上一个全劳力。又新开磨坊七座、店坊一座、小生产铺一座，还准备开大油坊，新买了两头骡一头驴，闹的轰轰烈烈，家家男女不闲一个人。（连一山）
