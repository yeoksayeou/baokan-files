　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. According to an announcement by the American Embassy in Nanjing on the 18th, Wedemeyer is scheduled to arrive in Nanjing on the 22nd. In recent days, many reports from the United States have revealed that Wedemeyer's visit to China is a step towards more active and open American aid to Chiang's invasion of China. However, even American officials have lost confidence in whether Chiang Kai-shek can be saved and are filled with anguish. Many "foreign" (i.e., American) observers living in the Northeast and North China declared: "The former commander of the China war zone coming to China is a preparatory step for the application of the Truman Doctrine to the Far East, if such a drastic step proves feasible after investigation." (United Press International, Beijing, 13th). According to the United Press, Wedemeyer's mission to China may, as Secretary of Commerce Harriman predicted a week ago, "extend the Marshall Plan to Asia." (Washington, 12th)

　　However, because the collapse of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule cannot be saved by any force, even American officials have to show anguish. "These officials are not very confident that Wedemeyer will find a way out of China's predicament. Many responsible authorities in Washington agree that Wedemeyer will face a situation in China (referring to the Chiang family's rule) that is worse than before Marshall left China; they believe that the current economic situation of China's 400 million people makes it, if not completely impossible, at least almost impossible for the United States to achieve its goals." (Associated Press, Washington, 15th). The influential Americans in Peiping cannot help but harbor the following fears about America giving the Kuomintang full military support in the current civil war: "First, this approach will encounter high public dissatisfaction in the United States. Second, it will arouse the hostility of the majority of the Chinese people towards the United States. Third, under the current war methods, the Kuomintang's victory over the Communist Party is far away and almost impossible." Their confidence has even been shattered to the extent that the issues Wedemeyer is coming to China to investigate "will undoubtedly include the policy Washington should adopt once the Nanjing government collapses – some observers in Peiping have predicted that this collapse is not far away." (Associated Press, Peiping, 15th). They deeply feel that investing in Chiang Kai-shek's precarious civil war company is as dangerous as throwing stones into the sea.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th. According to a United Press International report from Nanjing on the 16th, the Nanjing Kuomintang authorities are frantically arranging a welcome for Wedemeyer and preparing to take the opportunity to sell out sovereignty and beg for new loans. The United Press stated that the Kuomintang Executive Yuan departments are drafting a loan request plan to be submitted directly or through Wedemeyer to the U.S. government for approval. Senior officials of the Kuomintang Foreign Ministry held a meeting on the evening of the 15th to discuss "how to report the situation of Kuomintang China to Wedemeyer," which lasted until midnight.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 20th. According to a United Press International report from Shanghai on the 18th, citing Nanjing sources, Chiang Kai-shek, in order to implement a "general mobilization" for the civil war, expects to increase expenditures by 13 trillion yuan in the next six months. The Chiang Defense Ministry has submitted this increased budget to the Chiang government's Executive Yuan. According to United Press International, citing sources close to the Chiang government, the Chiang government will beg Wedemeyer to borrow money from the United States to make up for its huge budget deficit. Note: The New York Afternoon Post on June 15th reported that the Chiang government had spent 14 trillion yuan in Chiang currency in the first four months of this year and would need at least 40 trillion yuan to get through this year; thus, the Chiang government's full-year budget, including the supplementary budget, will reach 70 trillion yuan. The Afternoon Post pointed out that even with American loans, it would not be possible to sustain such huge war expenses for long.

### 蒋介石反动统治接近总崩溃　魏德迈来华亦无法挽救　美国官方人士对蒋也失掉扶植信心

　　蒋介石反动统治接近总崩溃
  　魏德迈来华亦无法挽救
  　美国官方人士对蒋也失掉扶植信心
    【新华社陕北二十日电】据南京美大使馆十八日宣布，魏德迈预定于二十二日可抵达南京。旬日以来，许多来自美国方面的消息透露，魏德迈来华乃是美国更积极更公开援蒋侵华的步骤。但即使是美国官方人士，对于是否还能救活蒋介石一层，亦已失却信心，满怀苦闷。许多住在东北与华北的“外国”（按即美国）观察家宣称：“前中国战区司令之来华，是杜鲁门主义适用于远东的准备步骤，如果此种激烈步骤经调查证明可以实行的话”。（美联社十三日北平电）另据合众社称：魏之使华，可能如周前美商务部长哈里曼所预料：“将马歇尔计划扩及亚洲。”（十二日华盛顿电）
    可是，由于蒋介石反动统治的崩溃，已非任何力量所能挽救，此点即令美国官方人士亦不得不显示苦闷。“这些官员对于魏德迈会找出中国窘境的出路信念并不很强。华盛顿许多负责当局人士同意魏德迈将面对中国（指蒋家统治）的比马歇尔离华前更恶化的态势；他们认为目前中国四万万人民所处的经济情况，使美国如果不是完全不可能的话，至少也是几乎不可能实现其目的。”（美联社十五日华盛顿电）北平有力的美国人方面，对美国在目前内战中给国民党作全面的军事支持，也不能不怀如下的恐惧：“第一、这种办法将在美国遭遇人民高度不满。第二、引起中国人民的大多数对美敌视。第三、在目前战争方法下，国民党战胜共产党乃遥遥无期，几乎不可能的事。”甚至他们的信心幻灭到如此程度：魏德迈来华所要调查的问题，“其中当少不了有南京政府一旦崩溃，华盛顿所应采取的方针问题——北平一部分观察家曾预言此种崩溃当不在远。”（美联社北平十五日电）他们深感对蒋介石的风雨飘摇的内战公司投资，将有如石沉大海的危险。
    【新华社陕北十九日电】据合众社南京十六日消息，南京国民党当局正手忙脚乱地布置对魏德迈的欢迎，并准备乘机出卖主权，乞求新贷款。合众社称：国民党行政院各部正草拟一请求贷款的计划，以直接地或经魏德迈提交美国政府以请求批准。国民党外交部高级官员为讨论“向魏德迈呈报国民党中国之情形的方法”，于十五日晚举行会议，一直到午夜始散。
    【新华社陕北二十日电】据合众社十八日沪电引南京消息称：蒋介石为实行内战“总动员”，预计今后半年内将增加十三万亿元的支出，此项增加预算，蒋记国防部已提出于蒋政府行政院。据合众社透露，根据接近蒋政府方面人士消息，蒋政府将乞怜魏德迈向美国借债以求弥补其巨大的预算赤字。按：六月十五日纽约下午报载，蒋政府在今年头四个月内已用去蒋币十四万亿元，至少尚须四十万亿元才能度过今年；则今年蒋政府全年预算合追加预算，将达七十万亿元。下午报曾指出，即令美国借款，亦不能长此维持如此巨大的战费。
