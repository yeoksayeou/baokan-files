Dongbei Organizes the Masses to Save, Earns Money and Deposits it in the Credit Cooperative

[This Newspaper reports] Under the active efforts of Comrade Wang He Kui, manager of the Dongbei Credit Cooperative in Licheng, business has greatly expanded. They have raised 200,000 shares of capital, absorbed 400,000 yuan in deposits, and lent out 520,000 yuan. In the past, the village had serious waste. During the discussion, the head of civil education, Li Shuqin, said, "If we have 500 yuan, we go to the city, eat a bit, and buy a vegetable, and it's gone. If we deposit it in the credit cooperative, we won't eat it. We can get by with radishes and greens at home." Therefore, the methods of collective transportation deposits, depositing in small amounts and withdrawing in large amounts, and borrowing in large amounts and repaying in small amounts were implemented. The transportation back does not involve dividends. The team leader unifies the money to the credit cooperative. Whoever uses it takes it, and if it is not used, it is deposited. When buying livestock, it is withdrawn all at once, and if it is not enough, it is borrowed again, and the loan is repaid gradually. For example, Wang Chunmai has now saved 20,000 yuan. The masses report that they no longer buy food when they go to the city and say they can save money. Village Chief Cao Genhe said, "If the credit cooperative had been established earlier, we wouldn't have wasted so much." The credit cooperative now has more than 160,000 yuan and is planning to help the masses store substitute foods.

    董北组织群众节约
    赚了钱存入信用部
    【本报讯】黎城董北信用部在经理王河魁同志的积极努力下，业务大为开展。他们集了二十万股金，吸收了四十万元存款，贷出款五十二万元。该村过去浪费现象严重，在讨论时民教主任李书芹说：“咱身上有五百元到城装装脚吃上些买根菜就完了，如存到信用部就不吃了，家里有罗卜菜也能行”。于是实行了运输集体存款，零存整拿，整借零还办法，运输回来不分红，由队长统一交到信用部，谁用谁取，不用就存，买牲口时一总取，不够时再贷，贷上还是陆续归还。如王春买现在已存下二万元。群众反映他们下城也不买吃了，并说还能节约哩。村长曹根河说：“早成立信用部咱也浪费不了”。现信用部有款十六万余元，正计划帮群众储存代食品。
