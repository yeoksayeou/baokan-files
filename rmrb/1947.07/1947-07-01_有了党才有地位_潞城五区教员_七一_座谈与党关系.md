　　Having the Party Means Having Status
  　Teachers in the Fifth District of Lucheng Hold "July 1st" Symposium on Relationship with the Party
    [Our newspaper, Lucheng news] All the teachers in the Fifth District gathered on the 23rd of last month to commemorate "July 1st" in advance. During the meeting, they discussed the "July 1st" commemorative propaganda instructions issued by the Taihang District Party Committee, as well as the authoritative comments by CCP figures on the current situation and the propaganda materials of the Lucheng County Party Committee. All the teachers had a deep and full understanding of the Party's glorious struggle history over the past twenty-six years, and all said, "Without the Party, there would be no China, no today, and no ourselves." The teachers also conducted self-criticism regarding their thoughts about the Party and the Party's impact on them. Comrade Liu Hulin said, "My family was the poorest and most miserable, with only three and a half mu of land, which was also occupied by the landlord. My father starved to death, my mother begged for food. I joined the guerrillas, and after liberation, I was honorably discharged and returned home. My family turned over, got land and houses, and I got married. My family's turning over was given by the Party. I was raised by the Party. Without the Party, there would be no me. But in my work, I have been inconsistent, and I am truly sorry to the Party." Comrade Liang Guobao said, "I used to be a teacher for seventeen years, and because I didn't invite the landlord to dinner during the Dragon Boat Festival, my rice bowl was smashed, and I was told to go home and take care of the children. Now, as a teacher, the cadres and the masses treat me very well. I even received credit for summarizing production. My status was also given to me by the Party." Finally, it was unanimously agreed that cadres at all levels, activists, children, blind people, and ballad propaganda activists should use radio stations, public blackboards, street skits, ballad tunes, and historical visits to carry out a mass "July 1st" propaganda movement week. Comrade Yang Xinfang said, "We must use our weapons—our mouths and pens—to hit accurately and make contributions in propaganda." The teachers' morale was particularly high, and they have already compiled seven ballads and two folk songs in two days. Currently, the propaganda movement is being carried out in all villages in the district in conjunction with the wheat harvest campaign. (Yan Xian, Ying Bo, Xin Fang, Ji Zeng, Huai Yi)

　　有了党才有地位
  　潞城五区教员“七一”座谈与党关系
    【本报潞城讯】五区全区教员，于上月二十三日集会，提前纪念“七一”，会中讨论了太行区党委所发出的“七一”纪念宣教指示，中共权威人士评论目前时局及潞城县委宣传教材，各教员对党的二十六年中的光荣斗争历史，都有了深刻充分的认识，都说：“没有党就没有中国，没有今天，没有自己。”各教员又作了党对自己、自己对党的思想检查，刘虎林同志说：“我家最穷最苦，只有三亩半地还被地主霸占，父亲饿死，母亲要饭，我参加游击队，解放后，挂彩退伍回家，我家翻了身分地分房，我又结了婚，我家翻身利益是党给的，我是党养活大的，没党就没有我，可是我在工作中犯冷热病，真是对不起党。”梁国宝同志说：“我过去当教员十七年，因为端午节没请老财吃饭，打了饭碗，叫我回家瞧孩子，现在当教员干部群众对我很好，总结生产还给我立了一功，我有地位也是党给我的。”最后一致通过要各级干部、积极分子、儿童、盲人、板话宣传鼓动家用广播台、大众黑板、街头快板剧、快板小调、访古等形式开展群众性的“七一”宣传运动周。杨新芳同志说：“拿我们的武器——嘴头、笔头，要打的准，要在宣传上立功”。各教员情绪特别高涨，两天内已编出快板七篇，小调二篇。现宣传运动正结合着麦收运动，在全区各村开展中。（廷贤、英波、新芳、吉增、怀义）
