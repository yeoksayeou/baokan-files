    Taihang Fourth Military Sub-district "Sun Village" Unit
    Shatters Enemy's Grain Grab by Over a Thousand Troops
    [Report from our Taihang Fourth Military Sub-district] On the morning of June 29th, over 1,500 troops of the enemy's Liu Mingde and Zhang Songxuan units from Xiuwu occupied Jiuli Mountain to provide cover for troops looting grain at the foot of the mountain. Our "Sun Village" unit immediately attacked Jiuli Mountain with a portion of its forces, while the main force attacked Wangzhang Village from Maozhai. Our troops arrived at the village in ten minutes, and the enemy quickly fled. Our first detachment killed the enemy platoon leader and bugler, captured two messengers alive, and the deputy regiment commander fled in a panic. In this battle, we killed 20 enemy soldiers, wounded 36, captured 2, seized 465 rounds of ammunition, 10 rifles, 6 grenades, over 50 livestock, over 20 carts, over 30,000 catties of wheat, and some clothing, which has been handed over to the democratic government for distribution to the masses.
