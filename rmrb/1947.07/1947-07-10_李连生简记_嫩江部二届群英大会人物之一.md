Brief Notes on Li Liansheng
One of the Figures from the Second Heroes' Congress of the Nenjiang Military Region
Luttedan

　　At the end of 1945, when the troops moved from the Shangdang area to the Pinghan Railway line, they passed through Wu'an, only seven li away from the home of medic Li Liansheng. Li Liansheng wanted to go back and see his family, whom he hadn't seen in the seven years since the Japanese occupation. Because the troops had combat missions, they couldn't stay long. The instructor told him the location of the bivouac that night and told him to be sure to come back. Li Liansheng only stayed at home for an hour and a half. His mother wanted to cook for him, but he refused, only drinking a sip of water. He found the village cadre and said, "My family doesn't need any special care from you. Don't be special, and don't disobey the village's management. Just treat us like any other poor folks." After saying that, he rushed back...

　　His older brother saw him off outside the village and complained:

　　"You've been away for several years and haven't sent a letter home. People are saying you're working for the Jin-Sui Army. I don't know for sure and don't dare say anything."

　　When Li Liansheng heard this, he felt increasingly upset. He walked along, shedding tears all the way. He thought that he had been working in the Eighth Route Army for six or seven years, fighting hard against the Japanese, but ended up being branded as being in the Jin-Sui Army. When he returned to the battalion, he was in a terrible mood. The instructor asked him, "You're back?" He replied gruffly, "I'm back." The instructor asked him again, "Are you going to eat?" He said bluntly, "No." The instructor found his behavior strange and asked, "Who are you angry with? Who offended you?" Li Liansheng, as if he had been wronged, told the instructor everything his brother had said. After listening, the instructor comforted him, "It's nothing. I'll take responsibility for writing a letter to your county, district, and village to prove it. You can rest assured." Li Liansheng immediately became happy. After the instructor wrote the letter and sent it out, he acted as if nothing had happened and continued to work as usual.

　　The troops were stationed in Shuileng. After the New Year, his older brother came to see him and asked about the situation at home. His brother said, "Things are much better now. They even sent rice noodles and pork to pay New Year's greetings, showing us a lot of respect." Li Liansheng said with a smile, "Whether or not we get preferential treatment doesn't matter much, as long as they don't say I'm in the Jin-Sui Army and erase my six or seven years of glorious revolutionary history. I joined the revolution when I was thirteen and am determined to see it through to the end."

　　During the battle of Houtun, Li Liansheng heard at the battalion command post that a platoon leader had been wounded in the forward fortifications. He hurried to rescue him, but the platoon leader had already been taken down. He stayed there, thinking that he shouldn't go too far, otherwise he wouldn't be able to rescue anyone if there were more casualties. Unexpectedly, a grenade flew over and exploded in front of him. His clothes were full of holes, and his left eye felt hot. He touched it with his hand and felt a handful of blood. He was shocked and left the line of fire.

　　At the rear hospital, despite medical treatment, his left eye was eventually blinded because the vital part was hit. But Li Liansheng was not pessimistic or disappointed. The doctor issued him a second-class disability certificate and wanted him to retire from the army, but he refused. He even wrote a letter to the battalion leaders, saying, "I have already blinded my eye, but the other injuries are not serious. Please don't worry. Even if I'm blind, it doesn't matter. Once I'm better, I'll go back and continue to fight." Before his wound had completely healed and his injured left eye was still tearing frequently, he requested to be discharged from the hospital. That day, he and Li Zhongfu left together. They had confirmed the location of the troops, but just as he arrived, the troops set off. They continued to press on. When they reached the Second Battalion of his regiment, it was almost lunchtime. They learned that his battalion was still twenty or thirty li ahead and might be moving again that night. Without delay, he didn't even eat lunch and ran straight to the battalion headquarters.

　　The comrades in the battalion were very happy to see him back. Hearing that his eye hadn't completely healed, the battalion and company headquarters prepared medicated sunglasses, leather-soled shoes, and clothes for him, and invited him to eat and drink. When the soldiers saw him, they all greeted him and saluted him. He was extremely moved, thinking that if he didn't work hard, he would be letting down the comrades' friendship. From then on, wherever there were casualties, that would be his post.

　　After that, whenever there was a battle, Li Liansheng would always run to the positions of each company and platoon to familiarize himself with the terrain so that he could quickly rescue the wounded. Once, a soldier asked him, "Don't you have a designated post? Why are you running around everywhere?" Li Liansheng replied, "Wherever there are casualties, that's my post." During the battle of Minquan, because an officer was wounded, he took on the task of command, telling the soldiers to dig fortifications and hide, and taking advantage of the gaps in the enemy's firepower, resolutely led the troops to a safe transfer. Only three severely wounded soldiers couldn't move and were still crawling on the position. Li Liansheng thought of many ways, but it was easy to expose the target during the day, so he was unsuccessful. Just as dawn was breaking, the attacking troops were replaced by another unit. Li Liansheng still followed them with a stretcher, rescuing the three severely wounded soldiers.

　　Because of these actions, he received a commendation order from the Military Region. At this Heroes' Congress, a special exhibition room was set up to display his deeds. Heroes and models who entered this room praised him one after another. The commendation order personally signed by leaders Liu and Deng, with a bright red seal, attracted particular attention. One hero pointed to him and said, "This is success, this is success. This is more glorious than anything else." Then he read it aloud. At this moment, Li Liansheng happened to walk in. Another hero glanced at the portrait on the wall and ran over to ask him, "Are you Li Liansheng?" Li Liansheng smiled and nodded. Everyone in the room turned to look at him.

　　李连生简记
    嫩江部二届群英大会人物之一
    鹿特丹
    四五年底，部队由上党区开往平汉线，路过武安，离卫生员李连生的家只有七里地，李连生想回去看看从前日本人在时七年来没回过的家。因为部队有战斗任务，不能久停，教导员告诉了他当天晚上的宿营地点，要他一定赶回来。李连生回到家只待了一个半钟头，他娘要给他做饭吃，他不叫做，只喝了口水，找着村干部说：“俺家里也不用你们多照顾，不要特殊，也不要不听村上管理。别的穷老百姓怎么样就怎么样。”说完急着就往回赶……。
    他哥哥送他到村外报怨似的说：
    “你出门几年了，也不往家捎个信，人家都说你干的是晋绥军，俺也不清楚，不敢哼。”
    李连生一听，越想越不好受，一路走着掉了一路的眼泪，想着自己在八路军干了六、七年，艰苦抗战，却落了个当晋绥军的黑名，回到营里简直就没有好气，教导员问他：“你回来啦？”他粗声大气的说：“回来了”。教导员又问他：“你吃饭吗？”他又直杠杠的说：“不吃”。教导员见他那样子很奇怪，又问：“你生谁的气呀？谁得罪了你？”李连生象受了委曲似的一五一十地把他哥哥说的话告诉了教导员，教导员听完了安慰他道：“这没有啥，我负责给你们县上、区上、村上写个信去证明一下，就对了，你安心好了。”李连生顿时就高兴了。当教导员把信写好，发出以后，他就象没有发生这个事一样，照常地工作起来。
    部队住在水冷，过罢年他哥哥来看他了，问起家里的情形，他哥哥说：“现在可好了，过年还给送了粉条、猪肉来拜年，很看得起咱们。”李连生笑着说：“优待不优待吧，也没啥，只要不说俺当晋绥军，把俺六、七年光荣的革命历史抹了就行，俺十三岁上就参加了革命，决心要干到底。”
    打后屯时，李连生在营指挥所里听说有一个排长在前边工事里挂了彩，忙去救护，去时那排长已经下去了。他就待在那里想，不要走远了，再有彩号就来不及去救护了，不料一颗手榴弹飞来，炸在他跟前，一身衣服尽是窟窿，左眼上也热呼呼地，他用手去一摸，摸了一手血，他心里一惊下了火线。
    到了后方医院，虽经医治，左眼因为被炸中要害，终于瞎了。但李连生并不悲观失望，医生给他开二等残废证，要他退伍，他不肯，还给营首长写了个信说：“我已经把眼睛打瞎了，其他地方伤不重，请你们不要挂念，就是眼瞎了也没有啥，好了，我马上回去再干。”没等伤口完全好，受伤的左眼还时常流泪，他就要求出院。那天他和李中福一起走，本来问准了部队的驻地，不料他刚赶到，部队就出发了，他们又继续往前赶，赶到本团二营已快吃午饭了，一问他们那个营还在前面有二、三十里地，并且晚上可能又要行动，他就毫不耽误，上午饭也没有吃，一口气直跑到营部。
    营里同志见他回来了，高兴的很，听说他眼睛还没有完全好，营部连部都给他准备了药色眼镜，又准备了皮底鞋、衣服，请他吃饭喝酒，战士们见了都问他好，给他敬礼，他感动得不得了，想着要不好好干的话，真对不起同志们对他的友爱了，往后那里有彩号，那里就是我的岗位。
    此后每逢打仗时，李连生一定要去各连排阵地上跑跑，以便熟习地形，有了彩号好迅速救护，有一次一个战士问他：“您没有岗位吗？到处乱跑？”李连生回答说：“那里有彩号，那里就是我的岗位。”打民权时，因为干部挂彩，他就机动的担任了指挥，叫战士们挖工事隐蔽，又趁敌人火力的间隙果断地带领部队安全地转移了。只有三个重彩号走不动，还爬在阵地上，李连生想了许多办法，白天里容易暴露目标，总没有成功，天刚亮一点，攻击部队换了别的单位，李连生仍带着担架跟着他们上去，把三个重彩号抢救下来。
    由于这些，他得到大军区的嘉奖令。这次群英会上特别把他的事迹布置了一个展览室，英雄模范走进了这间房，莫不个个称赞，特别那张刘、邓首长亲自署名印有鲜红大钤记的嘉奖令引人注目，一个英雄指着他说：“这就成功了，这就成功了，有这个比啥都光荣。”接着就大声念起来，这时李连生正好走进来。另外一个英雄把墙上画像急急了了一眼，跑过来问他“你就是李连生吧？”李连生笑着点了点头，全房子的人都扭过头来看着他。
