Supporting the People, Thoroughly Exposing Grievances, Quick Struggle, Quick Distribution
General Liquidation Launched in Sujia Song Village, Ye County

[Report from this newspaper] Sujia Song Village in Ye County opened the general liquidation in five days by encouraging the masses to speak out about their grievances. The village had suffered from over ten years of rule and exploitation by the habitual bandit Wang Ziquan. After the establishment of the democratic government, it alleviated the people's suffering from hunger by first distributing relief grain and dividing the wheat fields of traitors, greatly gladdening the people's hearts. Following this, in completing the summer harvest, measures were taken to reduce the burden, with 77 percent of households being exempt from burden-bearing. The majority of the masses were able to eat their own wheat for the first time, further invigorating the masses. Based on this, the leadership launched a general liquidation within five days from the 19th to the 24th of last month. In terms of approach: First, individual visits were made to tenant farmers to hear their grievances, inspiring the masses' demands for struggle. Poor peasant Zhang Xiweng, after having his grievances heard, said to the masses: "Let's do it! It's okay, I'll bear the responsibility alone if anything happens. I'm determined to live and die with everyone; the crime of starving to death is also unbearable!" Such support from activists had a great effect on the masses. On the 20th, thirty to forty people quickly spoke out about their grievances. The leadership seized the opportunity to convene a meeting of activists. At the meeting, everyone cried out about the corruption of the head of the Baojia system, Guo Jinzhu, and other seven local bullies, and said that the masses were afraid that the seven landlord families would run away. The leadership immediately detained the landlords, satisfying the demands of the masses. Everyone's enthusiasm immediately increased, and they resolved to connect with five families each to stir up the entire village. They also put forward the slogan: "Open the bag and let out the stench. If the stench doesn't come out, add more stench!" On the 21st, a mass movement of connecting and speaking out about grievances was launched. In the process of speaking out, the masses quickly realized the truth that "everyone pushes a falling wall, and there is strength in numbers." The leadership then called for the establishment of a peasants' association. At the inaugural meeting of the peasants' association, there were more than one hundred people speaking out about their grievances. On the 22nd, the formal struggle meeting began. The seven treacherous bully landlords stood before the masses of the entire village. The masses rushed to speak out about their grievances, and out of 329 households in the entire village, more than 150 people participated. The seven bullies' corruption, high rents, exorbitant interest… all their evil deeds were brought up. The masses became even more aware of the cruelty of these bullies. Someone in the crowd shouted: "Let's settle accounts with them without rambling! First, let's settle the small-husband account. Your landlords pay four fewer husbands per acre per month than us. Now it's been ten years, calculated on the basis of ten months of husband service per year, you owe us four hundred workdays per acre. Converting workdays into rice, you should compensate us four thousand catties of rice per acre!" Everyone said: "Shouldn't all of their property be used for compensation?" The masses shouted: "If it's not enough compensation, we'll take everything!" When the masses' emotions reached their peak, the meeting was adjourned, and they went to the landlords' homes to take their possessions. This time, they recovered 600 acres of land, 250 rooms, 15 head of livestock, as well as clothing and furniture. The impact of this struggle quickly spread to nearby Thirteen Song Village and Kangjia Song Village. The main experiences of this movement can be summarized as follows: 1. Support the masses in many ways; detaining landlords is one form of support. More importantly, through this support, the masses can recognize their own strength in the struggle and understand that "there is strength in numbers, and there is nothing to fear when armed." The masses give themselves support in the movement. Only in this way can the enthusiasm of the masses be maintained for a long time. 2. Use poor peasants and hired laborers as the backbone to speak out and connect grievances, thereby extending the movement to a mass movement of speaking out grievances. 3. After the grievances are thoroughly exposed, don't ramble. "Taking everything" is the mass line and the demand of the masses. When the masses expose the ugliness of the landlords and bullies, they become justified and know that all the landlords' property should belong to the peasants. Quickly distributing the property to their homes becomes the basic demand of the masses.

    撑腰诉透快斗快分
    邺县苏家宋村展开总清算
    【本报讯】邺县苏家宋村五天打开诉苦总清算局面。该村曾受惯匪王自全十余年之统治剥削，民主政府成立后，解救人民饿肚痛苦，先发救济粮分汉奸麦田，人心大快。接着在完成夏收中，又采取了缩小负担面的办法，不出负担户占到百分之七十七，大部群众第一次能饱吃自己种的麦子，群众愈加振奋。领导上即以此为基础，于上月十九日到二十四日五天内打开总清算局面；在做法上：首先是找佃户个别访苦，启发群众斗争要求。贫苦农民张希温在访苦后对群众说：“干吧！没事，有事我一人承当，我坚决与大家共生死，饿死罪也不好受呀！”这样积极分子对群众的撑腰，作用极大。在二十号一天很快的就有三四十人诉苦，领导上抓紧时机，召开了积极分子会，会上大家哭诉保长郭金柱等七人贪污恶霸等问题，并说群众怕七家地主跑了，领导上当即扣押地主，满足群众要求，大家劲头马上大起来了，决心每人串通五家，把全村都轰起来。并提出：“解开布袋出臭气，不出臭气加臭气”的口号。廿一日群众性的串通诉苦就开展了。诉苦中群众便很快自觉到：“墙倒众人推，人多力量大”的道理，领导上便号召成立农会、农会的成立大会上，诉苦群众有一百余人。二十二日，正式的斗争会便开始了，七个奸霸地主站在全村群众面前，群众争先恐后的诉苦，全村三百二十九户，参加诉苦的即有一百五十余人。七个恶霸的贪污、高租重利………………一切恶迹，都提出来了，群众算更加认清了恶霸们的狠心骨头，人群中一个人高呼：“咱们和他算帐不要罗嗦，先把小夫帐算算，你们地主一亩地每月比咱们少出四个夫，现在十年了，按每年出十个月夫算，你们每亩地要欠四百工，以工折米，每亩地你们就该赔咱们四千斤米！”大家说：“他们的家产是不是都该赔？”群众高呼：“不够赔就是一锅端，高租高利帐一齐都要拿回来！”在群众情绪高昂到了顶点情况下，便散会去到地主家搬果实。这一次收回的有土地六百亩，房二百五十间，牲口十五头，及衣物家具等，这个斗争的影响，很快就传到了附近的十三宋村、康家宋村。综合这一段运动的经验主要的是：一、从多方面给群众撑腰；扣地主是一种撑腰，更重要的是经过这样的撑腰让群众从斗争中认识自己力量，懂得：“人多力量大，武装起来就不怕。”从运动中群众自己给自己撑了腰，这样才能保持群众情绪的持久饱满。二、以贫雇为骨干诉苦串苦，从而推广到群众性的诉苦运动。三、苦诉透后不罗嗦，“一锅端”是群众路线群众要求。当群众把地主恶霸的丑象揭穿后，理直气壮了，知道地主全部家当都该归农民，快把财物分回家，便成了群众的基本要求。
