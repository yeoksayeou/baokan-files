　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th: TASS, Paris, 17th: The leadership and working bodies of the Western Bloc, under the signboard of the "Temporary Special European Organization," have been merged by Bevin into a rudimentary form. All power is currently concentrated in the hands of a small executive committee, which will replace the so-called "Cooperation Committee" representing all participants of the Paris "European Economic Conference" and become the leading body of the new organization. The activities of the new organization are now entering the next stage, with detailed economic and political plans for Western Europe being drafted entirely in private offices and behind closed doors, in accordance with the economic and political expansion plans of American monopoly groups in Europe. Judging from various statements by American political circles and the Anglo-American-French press, West Germany is becoming the central issue of future plans for the political and economic recovery of Western Europe. Bevin was instructed to induce countries to participate in the conference and unconditionally accept the American plan to utilize the productive capacity of the Ruhr-West German region as the main condition of the Marshall Plan. Currently, the possibility of investing $300 million in the Ruhr coal mining industry is being discussed as an urgent issue. Urgent preparations are also underway to transform West Germany into a lawless activity zone for Anglo-American monopoly groups. French democrats are increasingly anxious about the current diplomatic policy of the French government, because France's participation in the Western Bloc and the harmful plan to rebuild German military strength is a risky sacrifice of French national interests.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: TASS, Paris, 17th: The fact that French economic policy seems to regard foreign aid as the only hope for salvation has provoked fierce criticism in newspapers recently. French commentators believe that relying solely on foreign aid seriously endangers the French economy. Lindler hinted in the "News Weekly" on the 14th that the United States might demand that debtor countries hand over a considerable portion of their foreign investments and gold. General commentary recognizes that this will ultimately prove to be a disaster for France, because according to "Liberation," France has lost three-quarters of its gold since liberation. "Liberation" described the French government's inability to manage France's economic recovery as: "Everything is as if the authorities' opinions are comforting themselves with the hope of a miracle in the face of the difficulties before them, and falling asleep." The newspaper also stated that the Marshall Plan is ineffective because the results of the Sixteen Nation Conference must be submitted to the US Congress, and even if the majority support aid to Europe, the conference procedure does not allow any decision before January 1, 1948.

    【新华社陕北十九日电】塔斯社巴黎十七日电：西方集团的领导及工作机构，在欧洲“临时特别机构”的招牌下，由贝文把它们合在一起而略具雏型了。现时所有的权力都集中在一个小小的执行委员会的手中，它将代替代表所有巴黎“欧洲经济会议”参与者的所谓“合作委员会”变成新机构的领导机构。现在新机构的活动正进入下一阶段，完全在私人办公室里和秘密的幕后，把西欧详细的经济与政治计划，依照美国独占集团在欧洲的经济与政治扩张计划去拟定。从美国政界的各种声明及美英法报界的说法看来，德国西部成西欧政治经济恢复的未来计划的中心问题。贝文曾奉命诱导各国参加会议，毫无保留的接受美国的计划，以利用鲁尔德国西部的生产力，作为马歇尔计划的主要条件。目前，投资三亿美元到鲁尔煤矿工业去的可能性，正作为紧急问题被讨论着。把德国西部转变到英美独占集团无法无天的活动领域中之急切的准备工作，亦在进行中。法国民主人士对于法国政府现时的外交政策路线日益焦虑，因为法国参加了西方集团及重建德国军事力量的有害的计划，是牺牲法国民族利益的冒险。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】塔斯社巴黎十七日讯：法国经济政策似乎以国外援助为得救的唯一希望一点，引起近日各报的猛烈抨击。法评论家认为，只是将一切希望寄托于外援，就严重地危害了法国的经济。林德勒在十四日的新闻周刊上暗示：美国可能要求债务国交出其国外投资与黄金的相当大部分。一般评论咸认此终将会证明是法国的灾难，因据解放报消息，自解放后法国已经去其四分之三的黄金。解放报形容法国政府据理法国经济复兴之无能的特点称：“每件事都是如此，仿佛当局之舆论对面前摆着的困难都以祈盼奇迹的希望自慰，而昏昏入睡”。该报并称：马歇尔的计划并无作用，因为十六国会议的结果必须提交美国国会，即使大多数赞成援欧，但会议程序也不允许在一九四八年元旦前有所决定。
