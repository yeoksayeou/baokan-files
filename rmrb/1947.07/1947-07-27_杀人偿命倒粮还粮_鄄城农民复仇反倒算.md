　　【Our newspaper Ji-Lu-Yu, 25th dispatch】 After the recovery of Juancheng, the democratic government resolutely supported the peasants, breaking the peasants' fear of "the sky changing" (meaning fear of the Communists being overthrown), and enthusiastically launched the revenge and reverse reckoning movement. When the enemy was present, the landlords colluded with the enemy, brutally murdered the masses, and confiscated grain and land, causing the masses to suffer greatly. After liberation, the masses demanded revenge and immediate access to food. However, due to Juancheng's repeated gains and losses and the enemy's deception, some peasants developed the idea that "the sky might change," worried about whether the enemy would return in the future, and feared that the landlords would come back to confiscate grain and land and kill people. Based on the peasants' thinking, the county committee held forums for village cadres and activists, and Comrade Yu Guang of the county committee reported on the current situation, using concrete facts to point out the fundamental changes in the strength of the enemy and ourselves, explaining that we have begun a major counter-offensive and recovered lost territory. After the report, everyone, based on their own life experiences, realized that Chiang Kai-shek would definitely fail and that we would definitely win. When discussing how to proceed in the future, they all poured out their grievances. Guo Sheng, a woman from Songlou, said, "If you take a catty of grain from the landlord, the landlord's women will demand twenty catties back." She said, "After returning home, I must punish the landlord's women, make her play a musical instrument and enter the door to kowtow, and send the grain back to us." It was unanimously decided to take the lead in reversing the reckoning after returning to the village. The method of reversing the reckoning was to have the landlords return what they had taken from whom, and to have the landlords' wives send it back if the landlords' men were not home. If they refused to give it back, the landlords would have to kowtow and apologize until the masses were satisfied. When talking about how to deal with the landlords, someone said: We used to leave the landlords a lot of things, pitying them, but they didn't have any pity for us and wanted to bury us alive. They are really ruthless, and we must treat them ruthlessly in the future. District Chief Yang said: The government will definitely strongly support the masses and order the landlords to return all the things they took from the masses. Those who killed will pay with their lives, those who owe debts will repay the money, and those who confiscated land and grain will return it. The government will definitely adopt the opinions of the masses. The village cadres and activists returned to the village with great enthusiasm. They conveyed the democratic government's decree on revenge and reversing the reckoning, and publicized the current situation of the major counter-offensive. As a result, the masses' idea that "the sky might change" gradually dissipated. They first wanted to reclaim their land. After the rain, the whole village organized a large-scale mutual aid effort with manpower and livestock to rush to plant thirteen hectares of land in three days. On the evening of the 12th, peasants from various villages gathered, igniting the flames of revenge and reversing the reckoning, demanding that the landlords quickly return everything they had taken. On the morning of the 13th, the landlords lined up everything they had taken back on the street. After breakfast, the streets of Litun were filled with all kinds of utensils, clothes, cotton, etc. The peasants happily recognized their belongings, saying, "Our things are now being returned to us." On the 14th, they began to take grain from the landlords. Men and women peasants throughout the village carried the returned wheat, saying, "Our wheat is now being returned to us."

　　杀人偿命倒粮还粮
  　鄄城农民复仇反倒算
    【本报冀鲁豫二十五日电】鄄城收复后，民主政府坚决撑腰，打破农民怕变天思想，热烈开展复仇反倒算运动。敌人在时，地主勾结敌人，惨杀群众，倒粮，倒地，群众痛苦不堪；解放后，群众要求复仇，要求马上有饭吃，但因鄄城数次得失，且受敌人欺骗蒙蔽，某些农民产生变天思想，疑虑今后敌人是否还会来，怕将来地主再来倒粮、倒地、杀人。县委会根据农民的思想，分别召开村干与积极分子座谈会，县书宇光同志报告了目前形势，用具体事实指出敌我力量的根本变化，说明我们已开始大反攻，收复失地。报告后，每人根据自己的生活体验，认识到蒋介石一定失败，我们一定能胜利。讨论到今后怎么干的问题，都纷纷诉起苦来，宋楼妇女郭生说：“分地主一斤粮食，地主妇女要倒回二十斤。”她说：“回家后非把地主的妇女治一回不行，叫她吹着响器进门磕头，把粮食再给咱送回来。”一致决定回村后带头反倒算，倒的方法是叫地主倒谁的送回给谁，地主男人不在家的叫女人送，送给不要的，叫地主磕头赔礼，一直到群众要了算完。谈到对地主的处理问题，有人说：咱以前给地主留的东西不少，可怜了他，可是他对咱却没一点怜悯，要活埋咱，他们真狠心，咱以后也要用狠心对付他才行。杨区长表示：政府一定大力为群众撑腰，下命令叫地主倒回东西全部倒给群众，杀人的偿命，欠债的还钱，倒地倒粮的再倒回来，政府一定采取群众意见。村干与积极分子回村劲头很大。传达了民主政府复仇反倒算的法令，宣传目前大反攻的形势，因此群众的变天思想渐见解除，他们首先要回土地；透雨后全村组织了人、畜力生产大互助，三天抢种完十三顷地。十二日晚，各村农民集会，愤燃复仇反倒算烈火，叫地主迅速倒出所倒回的一切东西。十三日早晨地主们把倒回的东西依次摆列在街上，早饭后栗屯街上摆满了一切用具、衣服、棉花等，农民们认回自己的东西高兴的说：“又该咱的东西还家哩”。十四日开始向地主倒粮，全村男女农民抬着倒回的麦子说，咱的麦子现在又倒给咱了。
