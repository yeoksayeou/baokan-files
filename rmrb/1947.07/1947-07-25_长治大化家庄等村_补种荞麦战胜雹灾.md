Changzhi News: Villagers of Dahuajiazhuang area, First District, Changzhi, were hit by hail on the afternoon of the 13th, destroying autumn seedlings. When discussing how to replant, Duan Ruixi said, "Nothing can be planted now. Planting one mu and harvesting one or two dou isn't even enough to pay the burden or the wages. Let's just rely on heaven!" Sixty-year-old Li Yushan said, "The government is asking us to replant for our own good, because they are afraid we will go hungry. The Chiang Kai-shek government doesn't care about our life or death. My 20 mu of land must be replanted with millet, buckwheat, and vegetables. Every dou we harvest counts. Planting one radish will be enough to eat in the fall." This discussion motivated the masses. Everyone said that replanting was the right thing to do. The next day, every household went to the fields to replant, planting 200 mu in one day. In the three villages of Dahuajiazhuang, Xiaohuajiazhuang, and Shijiazhuang, more than 5,000 mu of land damaged by hail and rain were replanted with millet, buckwheat, vegetables, and small white beans.

Cixian News: In Nanhuanghe Village, Fourth District, Cixian County, it rained on the afternoon of the 14th of this month. Men, women, children, and wives all worked together to seize the time for planting. Men plowed the land, women helped with the seed drills, and children sowed the seeds. Due to the lack of livestock, it was proposed that both livestock and drills should be kept busy, and people pulled the drills, working in sections and rotating shifts. The old bad habit of each family working independently was opposed. Plowing did not take unnecessary routes. Whether it was someone else's land or their own, they exchanged help until the planting was done, and then they carefully took care of the seedlings. In terms of exchanging labor, plowing three mu of land (including livestock and people) counted as one work unit. If the work could not be repaid, the wage was eight catties of wheat. A total of twelve mutual aid groups for rushing to plant were organized, led by cadres. In two days, 3,000 mu of autumn seedlings were planted in a concentrated effort. The emancipated peasants tasted the benefits of mutual aid for the first time. In particular, households without labor or livestock were able to plant, which was even more exciting.

　　长治大化家庄等村
  　补种荞麦战胜雹灾
    【本报长治讯】一区大化家庄一带十三日下午下冰雹，秋苗被打毁，讨论如何补种时，段如喜说：“现在什么都不能种了，种上一亩打一斗二升还不够出负担，不够工钱，靠天过吧！”六十岁的李玉山说：“政府叫咱补种是为了咱老百姓，是怕咱饿了肚子，蒋介石政府根本不管咱死活。我的地廿亩，完全要补种糜子、荞麦、菜，打上一斗算一斗，种一红萝卜到秋后能顶饭吃亩。”这样讨论推动了群众，大家都说补种对，到第二天各家各户都到地补种，一天种了二百亩。大化家庄、小化家庄、史家庄等三村，冰雨打坏的土地五千余亩，都补种上糜子、荞麦、菜、小白豆等。（王良善）
    【本报磁县讯】四区南黄河村本月十四日下午落雨，男女孩子老婆齐下手抢种，男耩地、女帮耧、儿童点种。因牲口缺乏，提出牲口耧两不闲，人拉耧子，分段分片换着耩，反对各管各的旧恶习，耩地不跑冤枉路，不论人家自己换着耩好了把苗捉好。在变工上，（连牲口带人）耩三亩地顶一个工，还不了工的，工资为八斤麦子。共组织了十二个抢种互助组，有干部带领，两天内突击种秋苗三千亩。翻身农民首次尝到互助的好处，尤其是无劳力的鳏寡无牲口的户能种上，更感兴奋。（磁县第四区张静守、李滨贵）
