[Reported from the Jinnan office on the 14th] Jinnan's emancipated peasants are consciously practicing thrift to support the great counter-offensive. In Weixian, about 90% of district cadres have quit smoking and drinking, and many district and village cadres have smashed their pipes. In the seventh district, dozens of villages no longer have a single store selling cigarettes or alcohol. In Nangong Chengguan, the trend of extravagance used to be very prevalent. This year, when compiling public debt registers, the street office didn't eat public meals, smoke a single cigarette, or drink tea. When meetings were held at night, they didn't light lamps to save electricity. In Yangjia Village, Seventh District of Xiazhen, the custom of giving gifts during the Dragon Boat Festival was also broken, saving the whole village 200,000 yuan. In Zhang Qijun Village, First District of Wuyi, 120,000 catties of wild vegetables were gathered in ten days, lowering the standard of living. After the wheat harvest, the slogans everywhere were "Save on the tip of the grain pile, but not the bottom; don't exchange wheat for steamed buns." Women spinning yarn at night without using lamps and saving firewood and rice while cooking are common phenomena. On May 27th, the children attending the Qiu County observation meeting all brought cornmeal buns. The main reason for the development of this movement is that with the arrival of the great counter-offensive, cadres and the masses are voluntarily practicing thrift and lowering their standard of living to support the front lines. The main experiences in carrying out this movement are: (1) Recalling the great famine of 1943. (2) Women taking charge of saving rice and grain in the family and persuading men. (3) Calculating specific accounts: "Not afraid of spending small amounts, but afraid of calculating the total," adding up the waste of tobacco and alcohol into grain, which could last for how many days, and the thinking became clear. (4) Village cadres taking the lead, with village cadres and activists not only promoting the masses but also publicly swearing to set a good example, which brought the masses along.

[Reported from the Jiluyu office on the 14th] The austerity movement in Guancheng and Neihuang has penetrated into the villages. In Zhaozhang Village, First District of Guancheng, in order to reduce village expenses, the village cadres always brought their own dry food to the district meetings and went home to eat after the market fair and office work. Because the village's miscellaneous expenses were the lightest, it was praised at the district village cadres' meeting. The masses in Qizhang Village, Fourth District of Neihuang, automatically formulated specific austerity measures: (1) Women do not wear jewelry, embroidered shoes, socks, or fancy clothes. (2) Everyone quits drinking alcohol. (3) Do not eat meat unnecessarily. (4) Do not smoke foreign cigarettes.

    威县厉行节约支援大反攻
    数十个村不卖烟酒
    【本报冀南十四日电】冀南翻身农民，自觉进行节约支援大反攻。威县约有百分之九十的区干部戒绝烟酒，区村干部不少砸毁烟袋。七区数十个村庄，连一家卖纸烟和酒的也没有了。南宫城关浪费之风已往很盛，今年造公负册时街公所都没吃公饭，未吸一支烟，未喝茶，开会有月光不点灯。夏津七区杨家庄五月节送礼的规矩也打破了，全村就省了二十万元。武邑一区张七军村十天拔野菜十二万斤，降低生活水平。过麦后到处的口号是“省囤尖不省囤底，不用麦子换馒头”。妇女夜间纺花不用灯，锅下锅上省柴米，是普遍现象，五月二十七日邱县儿童观摩会上都带着糠窝窝。这一运动的开展，主要是看见大反攻到来，为了支援前线，干部群众自动节约降低生活水平。这一运动开展的主要经验：（一）回忆四三年大灾荒。（二）妇女在家庭掌握节米省谷劝说男人。（三）具体算帐“不怕零花钱，光怕总算账”，把烟酒等浪费一总算成粮食，能吃多少日子，思想就通了。（四）村干带头，村干积极分子不仅推动群众而且自己当众宣誓认真作榜样，就把群众带起来了。
    【本报冀鲁豫十四日电】观城内黄节约运动已深入到村。观城一区召张屯村干部为了减缩村开支，每次上区开会都是从自己家中拿着干饭吃，赶集办公都是饿着肚子回家吃饭。因为村中杂支最轻，在全区村干大会上受到表扬。内黄四区七丈村群众自动订出具体节约办法：（一）妇女不带首饰、不穿花鞋、不穿袜子、不穿花衣裳。（二）大家一律戒酒。（三）无事不吃肉。（四）不吸洋烟。
