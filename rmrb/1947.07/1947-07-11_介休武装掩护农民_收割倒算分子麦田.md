    Jiexiu Armed Forces Protect Farmers
    Harvesting the Wheat Fields of Counter-Revolutionary Elements
    [This newspaper, Taiyue, 9th dispatch] The Jiexiu County Headquarters approved the masses' request and, with armed protection, the people in the border areas retaliated by harvesting the summer wheat of the "Struggle Corps" counter-revolutionary despots. More than 60 people from Shangmishan in the First District, under the protection of the militia, went deep into the villages near enemy strongholds, including Beijia Village, Yaozetou, Shanglingkou, and Suncun, on the night of the 25th, and harvested more than 60 mu of wheat belonging to the stubborn puppet Shangliang Township Chief and "Struggle Corps" members Feng Zhongxian, Yang Zeng, and others. During the harvest, the masses' morale was extremely high, and they all happily said, "We should have confiscated the wheat of these bad eggs long ago!"

    【本报太岳九日电】介休县指挥部批准群众要求，武装掩护边地群众报复，收割“奋斗团”倒算奸霸的夏麦。一区上米山群众六十余人，即在民兵掩护下于二十五日夜，深入敌据点附近之北贾村、窑则头、上岭口、孙村收割了顽伪上梁乡长及“奋斗团”冯中贤、杨增等麦子六十余亩。收割中群众情绪极为高涨，都高兴的说：“早该没收这些坏蛋们的麦子了”。
