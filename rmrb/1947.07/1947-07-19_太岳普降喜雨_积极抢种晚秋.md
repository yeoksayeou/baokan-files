[This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 17th] The region experienced widespread rainfall on the 10th and 11th, especially the fourth sub-region's Shimin and Gaoping, and the first sub-region's Tunliu and Changzi counties, which had suffered long droughts. The rain has soaked through, and the masses are overjoyed. Other areas, such as Yangcheng, Jincheng, and Qinshui, have also received rainfall of three to four finger-widths. Currently, the masses in various counties are actively organizing all able-bodied laborers, semi-able-bodied laborers, and auxiliary laborers to launch a sudden campaign to plant late autumn crops.
