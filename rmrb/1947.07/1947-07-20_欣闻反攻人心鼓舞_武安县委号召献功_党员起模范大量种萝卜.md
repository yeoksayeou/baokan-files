    Hearing of the Counter-Offensive Inspires the People
    Wu'an County Party Committee Calls for Contributions
    Party Members Take the Lead in Planting Large Quantities of Radishes

    [Report from this newspaper in Wu'an] While more than 700 Party representatives from various villages in Wu'an County were gathered to celebrate the Party's birthday, they heard the news of the great counter-offensive, and everyone was overjoyed and inspired. Comrade Wang Tingdong of the Party Committee, based on the new situation, called on all cadres, Party members, and the masses in the county to launch a contribution movement to win an early victory in the great counter-offensive. The main content includes: (1) Mobilize for the great counter-offensive and promote the great counter-offensive. (2) The entire county must formulate and implement plans to fulfill the work requirements for July before the Beginning of Autumn. (3) Party committees at the county, district, and village levels should lead this contribution movement. Branches should mobilize and publicize Party members to contribute to enhance the Party's prestige. Those who have not been made public should strive to be made public through contributions, be supported by the masses, and praised by the leadership. The masses should compete with Party members for progress and strive to join the Party. Branches should also establish a merit system and a register of Party members' contributions. Regarding the work requirements for July: mainly leading the effort to get rich and overcome the famine; (1) Plant all land, leaving no land idle, and plant large quantities of radishes. The county average should be at least two fen per person. All corn land should be loosened and have base fertilizer applied. Plant buckwheat where possible. (2) Implement the second 100-day textile campaign, with each woman completing ten jin of cloth per month. To improve the quality of the cloth, the old areas should produce eight chi per jin, and the new areas should produce seven chi. The cloth should be dry, white, fine, and dense. (3) Educate the masses to voluntarily reduce consumption and avoid waste. Cooperatives and state-owned stores should not sell consumer goods. Those who are generally extremely unnecessary and wasteful should be eliminated, except in towns. Cadres and the masses should universally abstain from smoking and drinking, not buy dyed goods, exchange rice for meals, save rice, collect vegetables, and store bran, with an average of ten jin of dried vegetables per person. Gather and chop enough fuel to prepare eighty jin of famine relief grain for the four months of next spring. (4) Rectify village finances, with government cadres treating it as an important task. Resolutely abolish private levies from the masses, otherwise, they will be prosecuted as embezzlers. Oppose unauthorized expenditures. Villages should also have budgets and organize production to solve village finances. (5) Organize to complete the plan. The old areas should complete a major inspection of mutual aid within a month, resolving the three major integration issues during the inspection. The new areas should clear the work accounts since the implementation of mutual aid and promote recording work and converting work. New and old areas are required to have typical villages at each base point and typical groups in each village. Cooperatives should streamline personnel and assist the masses in overcoming the famine, resolving difficulties in textile, transportation of grain, and cotton. Currently, the focus is on solving the problem of late-season seeds. (County Party Committee Office)
