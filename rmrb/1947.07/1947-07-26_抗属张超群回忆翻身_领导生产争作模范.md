　　Anti-Japanese Soldier's Family Member Zhang Chaoqun Recalls Overthrow
  　Leads Production, Strives to be a Model
    [Jinan News, July 24th] In anticipation of the Eighth Route Army's anniversary, military dependents like Zhang Chaoqun are reminiscing about their liberation, pledging to contribute, and striving to be model citizens in every aspect. Zhang Chaoqun, an anti-Japanese soldier's family member, is one of the leading women in Dongdongli, Guangzong. During the land reform last winter, she single-handedly rallied over 150 households. Elected as the vice-director of the Women's Liberation Association, she worked tirelessly day and night. Whenever there was a meeting, she would be the first to climb onto the roof, using a loudspeaker to call people to gather. During the mass movement, she actively encouraged women to pour out their grievances, leading the struggle against landlords. During the rush planting after the May rains, she organized four women's teams for rush planting, totaling twenty-one people, helping each other plant beans. She personally led one group, setting an example to motivate other groups. She regularly educated other women, stating that after the liberation, they should work hard in production and live a good life. After the wheat harvest, she collected five hundred catties of firewood herself, solving the problem of firewood shortage at home. Recalling her past hardships, she told reporters, "When the Japanese came, my family only had ten mu of land. The grain we harvested could only last until autumn. During the famine in '32, we ate even peanut skins, corn cores, and pillow chaff. Only five days after giving birth, I had to push the mill. Now things are much better. During the struggle the year before last, because we are the family of an anti-Japanese soldier, we were allocated seven and a half mu of good land. This year, we were allocated another seven mu and seven fen of land, and 47,000 yuan. We built two new houses and even raised half a cow. We harvested fifteen bags of wheat this year. If it weren't for the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army leading the liberation, my family wouldn't be alive today. My family is the family of an anti-Japanese soldier and a martyr, causing so much trouble for the villagers. I always feel bad about it. In the future, I definitely won't let the village cultivate the land for us. We'll save money on food and clothing, weave a few more bolts of cloth, and that'll cover one person's food and drink. Now that our army has started the counter-offensive, I plan to establish ten women's textile mutual aid groups to spin and weave more, so that the soldiers at the front have enough to eat and wear, and defeat that bad egg Chiang Kai-shek as soon as possible. We women can't go to the front lines, so we'll actively lead the liberation and production at home, striving to be a model family of an anti-Japanese soldier!"

　　抗属张超群回忆翻身
  　领导生产争作模范
    【本报冀南廿四日电】迎接八路军生日，军属张超群众回忆翻身，宣誓立功、处处争取作模范。抗属张超群是广宗东董里妇女领袖之一，去冬土地改革时，她自己一气串连了百五十多户，被选为妇女翻身会副主任，不分昼夜，东忙西跑，每逢开会，首先登房，用喇叭筒呼唤群众集合。在群运时，积极鼓励妇女诉苦，领导和地主展开斗争。五月雨后抢种，她组织了四个妇女抢种，共二十一人，互助点豆。她亲自领导一组，以身作则，推动各组。平日常教育别的妇女，在翻身后应该努力生产，过好日子。麦后，她自己拾了五百斤柴，解决了家里烧柴困难，她回忆起过去的艰辛生活，对记者说：“日本来时俺家就十来亩地，打的粮食只能吃个秋天，三十二年灾荒时，连花生皮、棒子心，枕头糠都吃光了，生了小孩才五天，就得推磨去。现在可好了，前年斗争时，因咱是抗属，分了七亩半好地，今年又分了七亩七分地，四万七千块钱，盖上两间新房，还喂了半个牛，今年收了十五口袋麦子，要不是共产党八路军领导翻身，俺家里人可活不到这时。咱家是抗属又是烈属，给老乡亲添这么多麻烦，心眼里总过意不去，今后反正不叫村里给代耕，家里省吃俭用、多织两个布、便余下一个人的吃喝了。现在我军开始反攻，我计划成立十个妇女纺织互助组，多纺多织，叫前方战士吃的饱穿的暖，好早点打败老蒋那个坏蛋，俺娘们家不叫上前线，就在家里积极领导翻身、生产，争取作个模范抗属！”
