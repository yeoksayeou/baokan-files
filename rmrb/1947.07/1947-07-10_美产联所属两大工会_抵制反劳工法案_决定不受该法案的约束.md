Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 7th: United Press, New York dispatch: A strike of 5,000 dockworkers in the Industrial Union Federation has brought all ships in the port of Baltimore to a standstill. Meanwhile, due to the impact of the strike by shipbuilding workers affiliated with the AFL-CIO, more than 75,000 workers have stopped work in the Atlantic ports. On the other hand, some labor organizations in the United States are now adopting a new strategy to evade the Taft-Hartley anti-labor bill. According to TASS, New York, July 4th: The two largest unions affiliated with the AFL-CIO—the Steelworkers Union and the Electrical Workers Union—have decided not to be bound by the bill and refuse to include restrictions on strikes in collective agreements. These two major unions have further decided to boycott the "Industrial Disputes Management Bureau" established under the bill, denouncing the bureau as a tool for detecting union activities and interfering in union affairs. Although the American Miners' Union has cancelled the strike originally scheduled to begin on July 8th, the new agreement signed by the union and the mine owners also protects workers from the fines stipulated by the Taft-Hartley Act for work stoppages. The agreement also stipulates wage increases, a reduction from a nine-hour workday to eight hours, and an increase in the per-ton extraction fee as a fund for the elderly and sick. According to the Associated Press: Under pressure from workers, the leaders of the American Federation of Labor have reluctantly passed a resolution recommending that its affiliated unions not include restrictions on strikes in collective agreements.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 4th: The anti-labor bill passed by the U.S. Congress, which deprives workers of their basic rights, has aroused indignation among British workers. According to TASS, London, June 29th: The annual meeting of the British Fire Brigade Union recently passed an extraordinary resolution opposing the bill, which describes trade union activities as criminal acts, and urging trade unions around the world to rise up and fight against this anti-labor bill. According to Moscow: The latest issue of the Soviet New Era magazine published a commentary on the passage of the U.S. anti-labor bill, stating: America's imperialist foreign policy must be adapted to its domestic policy aimed at strangling democratic rights. Labor newspapers believe that the anti-labor law is a supplement to the Truman Doctrine in domestic policy, and even the President's veto cannot conceal this fact.

　　美产联所属两大工会
  　抵制反劳工法案
  　决定不受该法案的约束
    【新华社陕北七日电】合众社纽约讯：产业工会联合会五千码头工人罢工，至使巴尔的摩港所有船只为之停驶。同时由于产联造船工人罢工的影响，大西洋港湾已有七万五千以上工人停工。另一方面美国若干劳工组织现采取了回避塔虎脱、哈特莱反劳工法案的新策略。据塔斯社纽约四日电，产联所属的两个最大工会——钢铁工人联合会与电气工人联合会已决定不受该法案的约束，拒绝在集体协议中列入不罢工的限制。此两大工会更决定抵制根据该法案而设立的“产业争执管理局”，斥责该局为侦探工会活动并干涉工会事务的工具。美矿工联合会虽然取消了原订七月八日开始的罢工，但该工会与矿主订立之新协议中，亦保障工人不受塔虎脱、哈特莱法案关于停顿工作应处罚金的约束。协议并规定提高工资，减九小时工作日为八小时，增加作为年老及患病基金的按吨抽费率。又据合众社称：美劳工联合会各领袖在工人压力之下已勉强通过一决定，即建议其各附属工会在集体协议中勿列入不罢工的约束。
    【新华社陕北四日电】美国国会通过剥夺工人基本权利的反劳工法案，已激起英国工人的义愤。据塔斯社伦敦六月二十九日电：英救大队员工会年会顷通过一非常决议，反对该法案将职工会之活动描述为犯罪行为，并敦促全世界职工会起来向此一反劳工法案斗争。另据莫斯科讯：苏新时代杂志最近一期对美反劳工法案之通过发表评论称：美国的帝国主义外交政策，必须与其旨在绞杀民主权利的国内政策相适应。劳工报界认为：反劳工法律是杜鲁门主义在国内政策上的补充物，纵有总统的否决，亦不能掩盖这一事实。
