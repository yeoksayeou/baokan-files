　　Jize and Other Counties Organize Labor
  　Rush Planting to Eliminate Barren Land
    [Report from Jinnan, 20th of this month] Although the Seventh District of Jinnan has carried out several rounds of rush planting, there is still a lot of remaining barren land. After the rain in the first ten days of this month, another campaign to eliminate barren land was launched, and rush planting was successfully completed by mobilizing labor through mutual aid and work exchange. Eight farmers' association groups in Jiangzhuang, Xin County, turned into temporary mutual aid groups for rush planting. Each group planted the remaining barren land of the elderly, weak, widowed, and those without labor or dependents of soldiers. Because Guanlou Village had few livestock, the director of the Armed Forces Committee led young and middle-aged people to pull plows, eliminating more than 5,000 mu of barren land in three days. Zhaizhuang in the Third District organized a temporary large-scale work exchange of people and animals, rush planting 506 mu of corn and 130 mu of beans in one and a half days. In Guozhuang, Qiu County, twenty women participated in mutual aid, pulling plows, and pulling rollers. Four teams of men and women pulling plows could pull 70 mu per day. In the Chengguan area of Guantao, 913 mu of barren land were rush planted with millet, corn, beans, and yams in three days. In Songyao Village, Yuanchao, 741 mu of small seedlings were rush planted in three days. The masses and cadres in Yongnian, Jize, and Chengci counties took advantage of the light rain to launch a rush planting upsurge. In Shiqiuzhuang, the Fourth District of Jize, a total mobilization of people and livestock eliminated 1,980 mu of barren land in three days. The Third Commissioner's Office stopped all work of the organs to help the elderly, weak, widowed, and dependents of soldiers, rush planting more than 20 mu in one day. Longxing Village in Jing County used the masses' natural form to organize paired groups to carry out large-scale mutual assistance throughout the village, and all the wheat stubble barren land was rush planted in two days, totaling more than 3,000 mu.
    [Report from Jize] The Jize County Party Committee recently held an emergency meeting to study and arrange the work of seizing the time to rush plant, hoe seedlings, and carry out summer cultivation. It also called on everyone to plant two or three fen of vegetables (large vegetables, rapeseed, and radishes, etc.) after planting seedlings. Vigorously absorb female labor to participate in planting vegetables, weeding, and hoeing seedlings. Secondly: Organize "hot hoeing" or even "bud hoeing." In each district, organize several sections for assault by village as a unit, and summarize as you assault. Summer cultivation issues: Barren land must be eliminated, and the fruits and tails of the current struggles and mature barren land should be planted as much as possible for autumn. If it is not possible to plant for autumn, it must be plowed for planting wheat this autumn. Village branch secretaries and village chiefs guarantee the elimination of barren land. All land that has not been distributed will not be burdened before next year's wheat. The above three tasks, planting, hoeing, and plowing, must be planned well in terms of time. The hoeing and plowing issues after the rush planting is completed must be organically combined. After the task is completed, commendations and role model selections will be carried out by village as a unit. Human and material resources should be used rationally, and mutual aid accounts should be cleared to break false pretenses of generosity and consolidate and improve mutual aid work. In order to ensure the smooth completion and realization of the plan: 1. A dam should be built in Nanshenzhuang to ensure irrigation of Guanzhuang when it does not rain. 2. Dig wells and use old wells. 3. When hoeing is tight, mobilize women to participate in production and sideline production. In leadership, break through the past difficulties of not being able to intervene in summer production. (Su Ran, Lan Fu)
    Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, 20th -- The Second Commissioner's Office of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Region issued instructions, calling on all newly recovered counties in Juancheng and Yuncheng on the south bank of the Yellow River to seize the time for rush planting. The instructions stated: All barren land around enemy strongholds and along both sides of highways where sorghum seedlings were forcibly uprooted by the enemy must be immediately organized for nearby masses to fully rush plant late crops. Organs and troops in rest and reorganization should regard helping the masses rush plant as one of the current central tasks. For the land of fleeing landlords that has not yet been distributed, cadres are responsible for rush planting. Cadres at all levels must conduct in-depth inspections to eliminate all wasteland.
