Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 21st. Chiang Kai-shek's planes and Chiang's troops have been frantically harassing the Yellow River embankment workers in the Bohai Region for days. On the 6th, two Chiang planes strafed the river south of Huimin, wounding two residents. On the 7th, three Chiang planes strafed carts transporting bricks in the Baiqiao area of Yangzhong (newly established county), killing one woman and three cattle. On the 8th, two more Chiang planes bombed and strafed the Qinghezhen area, attempting to destroy the dangerous works. The Chiang-puppet Shandong Security 18th Regiment even窜 (cuan - fled/scurried) to Zhangqiao and Zhoujiazhuang on the 1st of this month to arrest embankment workers, but were fortunately repulsed by local armed forces. In Jiyang, Huimin, and other counties, Chiang's special agents are frequently discovered firing secret shots at embankment workers along the coast. More than 100,000 employees along the river, in order to defeat Chiang's rampant conspiracy, are not afraid to risk their lives and are still working day and night to repair the river.
Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 21st. The Kenli (newly established county, northeast of Lijin) government in the Bohai Region has recently provided 480,000 jin of grain to relieve the disaster victims who moved out of the old course of the Yellow River. The grain is distributed according to the living conditions of the disaster victims, with each person receiving between 20 and 50 jin, benefiting more than 10,000 people. Previously, the democratic government had led them to distribute land, and this relief grain is issued to further help their production.
Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 21st. The Cangxian Democratic Government has distributed more than 230,000 jin of relief grain and more than 30,000 pairs of shoes to more than 13,000 poor citizens. It has also provided loans of 20 million North Sea currency (each yuan equivalent to 20 Chiang currency) to help hundreds of small vendors and closed businesses in the city to resume operations.

　　渤海区黄河堤工遭蒋机连日袭扰
    【新华社山东二十一日电】蒋机及蒋军连日疯狂袭扰渤海区黄河沿岸堤工。六日蒋机两架在惠民以南沿河扫射，伤居民两人。七日，蒋机三架在杨忠（新设县）白桥区一带扫射运砖大车，死妇女一名，牛三头。八日，又有蒋机两架在清河镇一带投弹扫射，企图破坏险工。蒋伪山东保安十八团，更于本月一日窜至章桥，周家庄一带抓捕修堤民夫，幸为地方武装所击退。济阳惠民等县，不时发现蒋特向沿海民夫打暗枪。沿河十余万员工为战胜蒋贼泛滥阴谋，不怕冒生命危险，仍竟日抢修中。
    【新华社山东二十一日电】渤海区垦利（新设县，在利津东北）政府顷以粮食四十八万斤救济由黄河故道迁出之灾胞。根据灾胞生活状况分配，每人可得粮二十斤至五十斤不等，受惠者达万人以上。前此民主政府即曾领导他们分得田地，此救济粮系为进一步帮助其生产而发。
    【新华社山东二十一日电】沧县民主政府已将救济粮二十三万余斤、鞋子三万余双发与一万三千余贫苦市民。另以贷款北海币两千万元（每元合蒋币二十元）资助城内数百户小贩与停闭的商号重新复业。
