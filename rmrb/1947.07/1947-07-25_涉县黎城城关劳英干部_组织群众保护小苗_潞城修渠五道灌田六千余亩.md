  　Organize the Masses to Protect Seedlings
  　Lucheng Repairs Five Canals Irrigating Over 6,000 Mu of Land
    [Report from this newspaper, Shexian] To respond to the county committee's call to fight the drought, town cadres inspected seedlings and found that they were just sprouting, with a danger of scorched buds (because there wasn't enough rain when sowing). Upon returning, they mobilized the masses to protect the seedlings. An old man said, "Saving seedlings is like saving lives; save one stalk, count it as one." Immediately grasping this slogan, they mobilized the masses. Some used grain straw to cover the seedlings horizontally, spacing them apart, while others covered them along the wheat rows. The masses said, "Covering them is even better than manure." They also used tree branches and cut artemisia to cover them. Participants in the seedling protection movement included teachers, high school students, primary school students, the masses, children, old men, and women, totaling over 900 people. In one afternoon, they covered over 150 mu. The masses were in high spirits and wanted to continue protecting seedlings and fighting the drought. (Anti-Drought Seedling Protection Report)
    [Report from this newspaper, Licheng] Ren Xinnian, a labor hero in the town, during a discussion on protecting seedlings at Xiaomin School, found that the masses lacked confidence in watering the seedlings, believing that watering them in 1943 not only didn't save them but actually killed them. He immediately investigated the reasons. Ren Xinnian said, "The main reason they died in the past was that the trenches dug were shallow and wide. If they weren't buried in time, they would be scorched to death by the sun. Using narrow [unclear characters] deep trenches and burying them immediately will all benefit." After this explanation, everyone understood. In five days, they watered 100 mu of seedlings. The main experiences were three: (1) Mixing water with manure (one load of manure for two loads of water) makes the seedlings more drought-resistant, and watering in the afternoon is most effective. (2) When watering corn, use narrow [unclear characters] deeper trenches and bury them in time to prevent scorching. (3) Water flowing into ditches for millet should be hoed in time to prevent sunlight from scorching them. Everyone unanimously proposed to cherish the seedlings and not relax watering them for a single day without rain. Now, the four major production brigades in the main village of the town are all involved in the seedling protection movement. (Liu Pengsheng)
    [Report from this newspaper, Lucheng] In Lucheng, while fighting drought during sowing, they seized the opportunity to organize villages along the Zhang River to repair and build canals, actively combating the spring drought. In Luhe and other villages, under the active leadership of the Water Conservancy Bureau and village cadres, a new active water canal (Tianyuan Canal) was built, with a total length of about seventeen li, divided into five branch canals, requiring a total of over 1,400 workdays. It can irrigate 1,400 mu of land, and as a result, all the irrigated land was sown on time. Then, the village repaired the Nanjiang Canal (drought canal) built last year, using stones to reinforce a water cave over forty zhang long to prevent water erosion, costing a total of 1,071 workdays. It can irrigate 690 mu of land. Nanma and Shiliang villages, also near the Zhang River, successfully repaired an existing canal, allowing 1,500 mu of irrigated land to be sown on time. Recently, taking advantage of the gaps in crash planting, weeding, and seedling protection (the second weeding was done after turning over the wheat fields), they organized four villages, including Houjiazhuang, to repair the Chenxitou Jianghe Canal. Three repairs were made, costing a total of 197 workdays and irrigating 1,700 mu of land. They also organized Chengjie and Xicun to build a 220-zhang-long stone river canal, capable of irrigating over 1,500 mu. The above five canals, excluding one for which the number of workdays is unknown, required a total of 2,816 workdays and can irrigate 6,770 mu of land. With an increase of five sheng of grain per mu after the autumn harvest, a total of over 300 shi of grain can be increased. (Jin Xiang, Wen Yi, Feng Jun)
    [Report from this newspaper] The Lin County Fifth District Committee, seeing the famine was already forming, painstakingly thought of ways to fight drought and prepare for famine. While holding a meeting and seeing river water flowing down, the district committee seized this opportunity, and after detailed planning, went to the villages overnight, mobilizing 2,346 people to build the Qiquan and Guilin Canals. The masses enthusiastically supported the district committee's proposal and actively participated. The five-li-long new canal was completed in one day on July 13th, capable of irrigating 1,650 mu of land. Water from the Qiquan Canal has already entered the ground. In addition, they organized mutual aid for large-scale planting. Villagers from Yugou, Gudonggou, Tumen, Wangjiazhuang, and Lujialing, under the slogan of "Farmers all over the world are one family, unite to fight drought and help each other with planting" proposed by the district committee, actively helped Qianjiagang, Fengluodian, Sanjingcun, and Qinjiapo villages with planting. Each village organized a united drought-fighting planting team, and the village established a united drought-fighting headquarters to lead the drought-fighting work. (Lin County Small Newspaper)
    [Report from this newspaper, Jinnan, 23rd] In Jize, one-third of the area has still not received soaking rain. Under the call of "Counter-attack for merit, fight drought for production," village cadres repeatedly mobilized the masses, finally overcoming the saying that "the soil is bad, wells cannot be dug" and relying on heaven for food. Chang Laotang, a labor hero from Li Machang Village, and cadres from Changzhuang Village took the lead in digging wells. Machang, Chaizhuang, and other eight villages have now dug 25 large wells that can accommodate waterwheels. The third and fourth districts are universally repairing old wells to increase water output. They are now watering seedlings day and night without rest. Dongliu Village in the fifth district has dug 50 earthen wells. The eastern villages in the first and second districts have dug 15 large wells for waterwheels, striving to dig 80 wells in a short period.

　　涉县黎城城关劳英干部
  　组织群众保护小苗
  　潞城修渠五道灌田六千余亩
    【本报涉县讯】为响应县委号召与旱灾作斗争，城关干部检查小苗正在黄尖露头，有烧芽危险（因下种时不是饱雨），回来就动员群众保护小苗，有个老汉说：“救苗如救命，救活一本算一本。”当即抓住这个口号发动群众，有的拿谷草横盖隔一步盖一安，又用麦顺垄盖，群众说：“盖上还顶上粪”，又用树枝割草蒿盖等办法。参加保苗运动的有师范、高小、初校、群众、儿童、老汉、妇女，共九百多人，一晌午盖了一百五十余亩，群众情绪很高，要继续保苗与旱灾斗争。（抗旱保苗报）
    【本报黎城讯】城内劳动英雄任新年互助队，在小民校讨论保护小苗时，群众对浇苗没信心，认为四三年浇苗不但没浇活反而浇死啦，当即研究原因，任新年说：“过去浇死主要是挖的圪道浅又宽，再不及时埋住，被太阳一晒腾死了。用窄＠＠圪道深，立即埋住，都沾光啦。”经这样谈后大家通了，五天中浇苗一百亩。主要经验有三：（一）浇苗水掺圊（圊一担水两担）耐旱，下午浇上最吃劲。（二）浇玉茭用窄＠＠深些，及时埋住不腾苗。（三）浇谷水流壕，及时锄下日光晒不了。大家一致提出爱护小苗，一日不下雨一日不能放松浇苗。现在城内主村四个生产大队，都卷入保苗运动中。（刘蓬生）
    【本报潞城讯】潞城在抗旱下种中，抓紧空隙，组织漳河沿岸村补修与兴修水渠，从积极方面向春旱作斗争。潞河等村，在水利局和村干部积极领导下，兴修活水渠一道（天元渠），全长约十七里，内分五个支渠，共用一千四百余工，能浇地一千四百亩，结果全部水地按时下了种。接着又将该村去年兴修的南涧渠（旱渠）一个四十余丈长的水洞用石头砌了根子，以免水冲，共费一千零七十一个工，可浇地六百九十亩，南马和石梁两村亦是靠近漳河，旧有水渠一道，也补修成功，使一千五百余亩水地按时下种。最近在突击补种回茬、锄苗、保苗的空隙（二遍苗锄过麦田翻下），又组织侯家庄等四村补修了城西头涧河渠。补修三处，共用工一百九十七个，能浇地一千七百余亩，又组织城街和西村兴修了长二百廿丈的石河渠，能浇地千五百余亩。以上五道渠、除一道渠不知工数外，共用二千八百十六个工，能浇地六千七百七十余亩，秋后以每亩增产五升粮食，共能增产三百余石。（晋祥、文绎、风俊）
    【本报讯】林县五区区委会，见灾荒已成，便苦心想抗旱备荒办法，正开会时见河水流下来，区委会抓紧这个机会经过详细计划，连夜到村，动员了两千三百四十六人，创修七泉、桂林二渠，群众热烈拥护区委这个主张，都积极参加，五里长新渠于七月十三日一天内完成，可浇地一千六百五十亩，七泉渠水已入地。另外又组织互助大点种，计峪沟、古东沟、土门、王家庄、路家岭等村群众在区委会提的“天下农民是一家，团结抗旱互助点种”口号下，积极帮助钱家岗、风落店、三井村、秦家坡等村点种，各村组织了团结抗旱点种队，村设立团结抗旱指挥部，领导抗旱工作。（林县小报）
    【本报冀南二十三日电】鸡泽迄今尚有三分之一地区未落透雨，村干部在“反攻立功抗旱生产”的号召下，反复动员群众，终于克服了“土质不好，打井不成”的靠天吃饭说法。李马昌村劳动英雄常老堂和常庄村干部自己先打井，马昌、柴庄等八村，现已打成二十五眼能按水车的大井。三、四区普遍修理旧井，使其多出水。现正昼夜不闲浇苗。五区东柳村打土井五十眼。一、二区东部村打成十五眼打水车的大井，争取短期内打够八十眼。
