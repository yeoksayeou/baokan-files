　　A Performance of an Anti-Civil War Drama
    Nankai University Students Write and Perform "Triumph"
    Zhu Maoji
    In mid-May, just as the angry tide of the national student movement was surging, students at Nankai University in Tianjin performed a drama called "Triumph." They performed this play with the intention of awakening a broader populace to oppose Chiang Kai-shek and the civil war. Kuomintang secret agents had interfered and obstructed them in various ways. So, what kind of play was it exactly?
    The play tells the story of a peasant family of five, spanning generations, destroyed by the civil war. The time is after the victory, and the location is a small rural village in a certain county in Henan. In the village, there is a Zhang family who fled from the Yellow River flood area during the War of Resistance. After the victory, only Old Man Zhang, his grandson Xiao Fu, and granddaughter Xiao Feng remained. Zhang's son, Zhang Defu, was conscripted into the army after the War of Resistance. Zhang Defu's wife was killed by Japanese soldiers. Xiao Fu, however, joined the "Self-Defense Force" during the War of Resistance, leading the villagers in resisting the Japanese, and had become the captain by the time of victory. One day after the victory, the "Central Army," leading the "Vanguard Army" (reorganized puppet "Imperial Collaboration Army") and the "Volunteer Army" (reorganized surrendered Japanese army), came to this small village to incorporate the "Self-Defense Force." The "Self-Defense Force" was unwilling to be controlled by reactionaries and traitors and refused to be incorporated. The former "Vanguard Army" secret agent, now a staff officer of the "Central Army," and Yamamoto, the Japanese colonel of the "Volunteer Army," believed that the "Self-Defense Force" was a "Communist army." Therefore, they advised the "Central Army" regimental commander to execute the "Self-Defense Force" captain, Zhang Xiaofu. Before his execution, Zhang Xiaofu shouted, "Even if we are communists, we are still our own people. Why listen to the enemy and puppet personnel? Our own people should not fight our own people." But finally, under the collusion of Chiang, the puppets, and the enemy, he was shot. The person ordered to carry out the execution was none other than Zhang Defu. When Zhang Defu heard the cries of Xiao Feng and realized that he had personally killed his own son, he committed suicide as well. Of the Zhang family of five, only Old Man Zhang and Zhang Xiaofeng remained to endure the tragic fate left by the civil war.
    The playwright's intentions cannot be said to be lacking in effort, and the method cannot be said to be not subtle, yet it still could not avoid the interference of secret agents.
    Nankai University students originally planned to perform the play at 2:00 PM on the 18th at the Yaohua School auditorium. Later, Yaohua Principal Chen Jinqing received anonymous letters and phone calls on the 15th and 16th, preventing the performance. Principal Chen then consulted with the school's autonomous student association, stating that if the program was changed, the performance could still be held at Yaohua. However, the association held a temporary emergency plenary meeting on the evening of the 16th and decided, in order to fight for freedom of performance, not to change the program, only to move the address to the North Campus of Nankai University in Liulitai, and change the time to 6:30 PM on the 18th. On the morning of the 17th, the school representatives also managed to obtain a promise of security protection from the Chiang-controlled municipal government.
    During the performance on the evening of the 18th, there was a scene in which Zhang Defu remembered that his son Zhang Xiaofu liked fountain pens and secretly entered a civilian's house (which was actually his own home) to steal a fountain pen (which was actually Zhang Xiaofu's own fountain pen), intending to give it to his son Zhang Xiaofu when he returned home after demobilization. The secret agents, taking advantage of this scene, instigated thirty or so plainclothes Kuomintang so-called "honorary veterans," using the excuse of "insulting the National Army," to cause a commotion, and the play could not continue and had to be stopped.
    The "May 20th" blood case further aroused the hatred of the Nankai University students, who insisted on performing the play. It was decided to perform it again on the 22nd. This time, it was done with strict organization. "Students without tickets issued by them are not allowed to enter, not even students." An information desk was set up at the gate, and there were many ticket collectors in front of the theater—the Nankai University dining hall.
    Most of the audience were students, along with some citizens who came to comfort the injured students. An elderly man of sixty-nine, Xiong Shucheng, brought medicine to the campus and gave a speech to the students, saying, "I have not done anything for many years, and I am extremely disappointed to see that the country has missed many opportunities for revival. This time, I was extremely indignant to see young people being brutally beaten for marching and petitioning against the civil war and famine, and the injured being refused admission to the hospital. Therefore, I am presenting the injured students with effective medicines for bruises and injuries that I have preserved for many years." After finishing his speech, he watched the play.
    The show officially started at four o'clock. The Nankai University choir sang three songs: "The Day of May 20th," a teahouse ditty "New Strange Song," and "Don't Fight, Can't Fight, Not Allowed to Fight." When the last song was being sung in unison, everyone in the audience sang along. For a time, the sound of "Can't fight, ah, can't fight! If we keep fighting, we can't live!" filled the hall, and the atmosphere was very somber and tragic.
    At 4:20, "Triumph" began. The audience's mood immediately became tense. Although there were only five or six hundred seats, and they were already full, people continued to come in, shoulder to shoulder. Before long, the empty space behind half of the dining hall was also filled with people. Not only students came, but also professors and others. The plot was intense, the actors performed with great effort, and most of the audience was immersed in the plot. At the end of the play, most of the audience had tears in their eyes. After the curtain closed, there was silence. The audience seemed to be immersed in endless sadness. Suddenly, a sad and passionate voice from behind the curtain called out:
    "My friends, thank you for watching this tragic story with tears in your eyes. You were moved, you cried. But after you wipe away your tears, think about why this tragedy happened... Chinese people with blood and conscience! Bring out the power of our people to oppose the civil war."
    After hearing this passage, the audience slowly walked out of the dining hall. One student said, "Regardless of whether the performance was good or bad, it's worth shedding a tear just to be able to see this play!"

### 一出反内战剧的演出　南开大学学生编演“凯旋”

　　一出反内战剧的演出
    南开大学学生编演“凯旋”
    朱茂辑
    五月中旬，正当全国学生运动的怒潮汹涌澎湃的时候，天津南开大学的同学们演出一出话剧，叫做“凯旋”。他们演这个戏，是打算唤起更广大的人民反蒋反内战，国民党特务们曾经多方的干涉并阻挠他们。这究竟是怎样的一出戏呢？
    戏情是叙述一个祖孙五人的农家，因内战而毁灭的故事。时间是在胜利之后，地点在一个河南某县的小农村里。村中有一家性张住户，是在抗战期中从黄泛区逃来的。胜利后家中只有张老者与他的孙子小福，孙女小凤三人。张老者的儿子张德福抗战后就被拉去当兵了。张德福的老婆被日本兵杀了。小福却在抗战期中参加了“自卫队”，领导村民抗日，胜利时已作了队长。胜利后的一天，“中央军”率领了“先遣军”（改编的伪“皇协军”），及“志愿军”（改编的投降日军）来到这小村，来收编“自卫队”。“自卫队”不愿受反动派、汉奸们节制，拒绝收编。原任“先遣军”特务，现任“中央军”的参谋，及“志愿军”的日本大佐山本就认为“自卫队”是“共产军”，于是便进言与“中央军”团长，主张枪毙了“自卫队”队长张小福。张小福就义前喊道：“就算我们是共产党，也是自己人，为什么听敌伪人员的话？自己人不应打自己人。”但终于在蒋、伪、敌合谋之下被枪毙了。奉命行刑的人正是张德福，当张德福田小凤的哭声里听出他亲手打死的就是自己的儿子时，他也自杀了。张家一家五口只剩下了张老者与张小凤去忍受这内战留下的悲惨命运。
    编剧者的用心，不能说不苦，方法也不能说不委婉，然而仍免不了特务的干涉。
    南大同学原定十八日下午二时在耀华学校礼堂上演出该剧。后来耀华校长陈晋卿十五日、十六日连接匿名信及电话，阻止此次演出。陈校长就和该校自治会洽商，表示如改换节目，仍然在耀华举行。但该会于十六日晚召开临时紧急全体会，决定为争演戏自由，决不更改节目，仅把地址移至六里台南大北院，时间改为十八日下午六时半。十七日晨该校代表又设法取得到蒋记市府保护安全的诺言。
    十八日晚演出时，剧中有一场演张德福记得他的儿子张小福喜欢自来水笔，私入民宅（其实便是他自己的家）偷钢笔（其实便是张小福本人的钢笔），想在复员回家时给自己的儿子张小福。特务们就借着这一场，唆使三十几个穿便衣的国民党的所谓“荣誉军人”，借口“侮辱国军”，哄闹起来，戏便演不下去，只好停演。
    “五二○”血案发生，更激起南大同学的仇恨，坚持要演出这个戏。决定于二十二日再次演出，这次是经过了严密的组织的，“不是学生不许入场，是学生没有他们发的票也不许入场”，大门口设了问事处，剧场——南大膳厅——门前更有不少的检票员。
    看戏的大部是学生，另外还有些来慰问受伤同学的市民等。有一个六十九龄老者熊述亲携药品送至校内，并对同学发表谈话称：“鄙人多年未做事了，眼看着国家错过很多复兴的机会，至为失望。这次看到青年人为反内战反饥饿游行请愿竟遭毒打，受伤的，医院竟不收灾，愤慨极了，特以多年保存的跌打损伤特效药呈献给受伤同学。”词毕即观剧。
    四点正式开场，南大歌咏团合唱了三支歌：“五月二十那一天”，茶馆小调“新古怪歌”，及“不要打，不能打，不准打”。最后一支歌合唱时，全场的人都一齐唱了起来，一时“不能打呀，不能打！打下去，不能活！”之声充满场中，空气十分沈痛悲壮。
    四点二十分“凯旋”上演了，观众的心情立刻紧张起来，虽然座位只有五、六百个，而且已经满了，门口仍是摩肩接踵的进来，不一会，膳厅后面一半的空地，也站满了人，来的不仅是学生，并且还有教授等。剧情紧张，演员卖力，观众大半沉寝在剧情里，剧终大部观众眼里都含了泪水。闭幕之后，寂然无声，观众们似乎都陷在无限的辛酸里，突然幕后有一个悲愤激昂的声音号召着：
    “我的朋友，感谢你流着眼泪看完了这个悲惨的故事，你感动了，你哭了。可是你拭干了眼泪想一想，为什么会有这种悲惨剧发生………有血气，有良心的中国人呐！拿出我们人民的力量来反对内战。”
    听完这一段话，观众们才缓缓的走出膳厅，一个学生说：“不论演出的好坏，我能看完这个剧，就值得流一次泪！”
