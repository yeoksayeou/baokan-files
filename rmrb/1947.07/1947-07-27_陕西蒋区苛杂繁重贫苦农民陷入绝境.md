　　Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 24th: A dispatch from Xi'an reports: Since Chiang Hu's troops invaded Yan'an, more than ten kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies have been added in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi under Chiang's control, including "comfort donations," cartage fees, national soldier training fees, bullet fees, repair fees, household registration fees, livestock transaction registration fees, birth and death reporting fees, and marriage application fees. In addition, the land tax has increased from 250 yuan to 350-750 yuan in Chiang currency per month. Grain is also levied per household, regardless of age or gender, with each person required to pay three jin of oil and flour per month. Replacing an ID card costs 1,300 yuan in Chiang currency, and even newborn infants must fill out forms and pay fees. Regarding conscription, two new techniques have recently been used. One is to concentrate able-bodied men under the pretext of training national soldiers, then escort them to various corps as reinforcements. In Hua and Lintong counties, nearly a thousand able-bodied men were escorted to Luochuan using this method. The other method is to force conscripted laborers to carry guns on their backs, thus counting them as enlisted. Under the heavy pressure of exorbitant taxes and levies, peasants are forced to sell their land in droves, and most of the impoverished are already in dire straits.

　　陕西蒋区苛杂繁重贫苦农民陷入绝境
    【新华社西北二十四日电】西安讯：蒋胡军侵犯延安后，蒋区陕西大关中又新增苛杂十余种，计有慰劳捐、大车费、国民兵训练费、子弹费、修械费、户口费、买卖牲口登记费、生育死亡报告费、订婚结婚申请费等。另外田赋每月由蒋币二百五十元增到三百五十元至七百五十元，还有按户提粮，不论男女老小，每人每月须缴纳油、面三斤。身份证更换一次，须缴蒋币一千三百元，即初生之婴儿亦须填证纳费。征兵方面，最近又使用两套技术，一是以集训国民兵为名，将壮丁集中后，即押送各兵团补充。华县、临潼两县即用此方法押送近千壮丁至洛川。另一种方法则是强迫担架民夫背上枪，即算入伍。农民在苛杂重压下，被迫纷纷抛卖土地，大部贫苦者已陷入绝境。
