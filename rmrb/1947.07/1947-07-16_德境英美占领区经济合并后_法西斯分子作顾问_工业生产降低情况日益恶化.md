Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: London dispatch: British Member of Parliament, Mr. Platts-Mills, wrote in the latest issue of the "British Committee for a Democratic Germany Gazette" that since the economic merger of the British and American occupation zones in Germany, the situation in the western occupation zones has been deteriorating. Bureaucratic rule has made it hopeless, and industry in general has declined due to coal shortages, threatening the stagnation of the German chemical industry. Mr. Platts-Mills stated that the merger has made the socialization of German industry impossible, and has merely opened the entire west as a door for the infiltration of American capital. Mr. Platts-Mills also wagered his political reputation, claiming that the merger "will concentrate even more of the dangerous elements in Germany, who have been gradually gathering since Nuremberg." The merger has become an obstacle to the democratization of western Germany and the unification of Germany, and is hindering European unity.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 9th: According to a report by Pravda reporter Korolkov from Frankfurt on the 7th, regarding the inside story of the economic merger of the British and American occupation zones in Germany: the "Economic Committee" established after the merger of the two zones is a mere façade. Behind it, pro-fascist elements are uniting, brewing plans to dismember Germany, and taking various measures to obstruct the implementation of the Berlin Resolution. In the American occupation zone, people are already "predicting" that the London Foreign Ministers' Conference to resolve the German question (note: the conference will be held in November) will suffer a "miserable defeat," and therefore it is necessary to act alone. Newmen, the American military governor of Greater Hesse, even hinted that Frankfurt would become the capital of an independent western Germany. Under this committee, all the paraphernalia of state institutions are in place. The heads of the various departments under the committee have been given ministerial powers, and representatives will even be sent abroad. As for the forty-four ministerial-level advisors in the committee's economic office, thirty-four are fascists. Furthermore, of the committee's two thousand employees, one thousand six hundred are former Hitler party members.

    德境英美占领区经济合并后
    法西斯分子作顾问
    工业生产降低情况日益恶化
    【新华社陕北十一日电】伦敦讯：英议员浦雷兹米尔在最近一期“英国争取德国民主委员会公报”上著文称：自德国英美两占领区经济合并以后，西部占领区的情形日益恶化，官僚统治已使其毫无希望，工业一般都因缺煤而降低，使德国化学工业有停顿的危险。浦氏称：合并使德国工业社会化成为不可能，而只是使整个西部成为美国资本的渗入洞开门户。浦氏并以其政治声誉作赌称：合并“将使自纽伦堡以来即逐渐汇集的德国危险分子，更大量的集中起来”。合并已成为德国西部民主化及德国统一的障碍，并阻碍欧洲的团结。
    【新华社陕北九日电】据真理报记者在科罗尔科夫七日自法兰克福报导德境英美两占领区的经济合并内幕称：合并后建立的两区“经济委员会”，是一个门面；在其背后，亲法西斯分子正在联合起来，酝酿肢解德国的计划，并采取阻挠柏林决议实施的各种措施。在美占领区，人们已在“预言”解决德国问题的伦敦外长会议（按该会将于十一月召开）将遭“惨败”，因此必须单独行动。大黑森省美国军政长官纽门甚至暗示说：法兰克福会变成独立的西部德国的首都。在该委员会之下，国家机构的一切附属物都已齐备，委员会所属各处处长都被赋予部长职权，甚至还将派代表赴国外。至于委员会经济处的四十四个部长身份的顾问中，则有三十四个是法西斯分子；另外该委员会两千职员中，有一千六百人是前希特勒党徒。
