　　Nangong and Qizhi
  　Seize the Time to Plant Autumn Vegetables and Eliminate Wasteland
    [Report from our Jinnan office on the 29th] After entering the hot season, Nangong and Qizhi mobilized to seize the time to plant autumn vegetables on "overlooked wasteland." After several planting campaigns, most of the land in Nangong has been planted, and the autumn seedlings are growing well. However, there are still four types of wasteland that have not been planted: First, "reserve land" that has not been distributed; second, land belonging to households living elsewhere; third, landlords' land for living expenses; fourth, land allocated to basic masses who are unable to cultivate it due to a lack of farm tools, livestock, and fertilizer. In response to the above four types of wasteland, the county party committee issued an urgent instruction, requiring rapid mutual assistance to plow the land and seize the time to plant radishes or prepare to plant wheat, so that the land would not remain barren. Zhao Xu, of this county, discovered that the local landlord, Xie Bing, had been allowed to retain fifteen mu of wasteland as a favor during the mass movement and that the traitorous landlord, Zhang Xiaqing, who had fled to Tianjin, had left fifteen mu of land uncultivated, all overgrown with weeds. All of this land was immediately distributed to the peasants. Within three days, the peasants had planted all of these wastelands with late seedlings. Qizhi County issued a notice to all districts to seize the time to plant autumn vegetables. The methods are as follows: (1) Mobilize manpower and livestock to reclaim wasteland. The cost of manpower, livestock, and feed will be borne by the county as a whole. After reclamation, no public grain or rent will be collected for three years; (2) The County Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the County Cooperative will prepare vegetable seeds such as small vegetables, red and white radishes, and wheat seeds to supply the needs of the masses for planting.

　　南宫·企之
  　抢种秋菜消灭荒地
    【本报冀南二十九日电】入伏后，南宫、企之总动员在“漏网荒地”上抢种秋菜。南宫经过几次抢种突击，土地已大部种上，并且秋苗长的很好，但仍有四种荒地未曾下种：一、未分配下去的“机动地”；二、在外户的土地；三、地主生活地；四、基本群众分得之土地，因缺乏农具牲口肥料等，无力耕种者。对以上四种荒地，县委特发出紧急指示，要求迅速互助犁起，抢种萝卜或准备种麦，不能一荒再荒。该县赵需检查出群运时给城内地主谢丙照顾留生荒地达十五亩及逃亡天津之奸霸地主张下卿留地十五亩，都是荒草丛生，当即全部分给农民，不出三天，农民即将这些荒地全部种上晚苗。企之县通令各区抢种秋菜，办法是：（一）人畜力到荒区开垦，人畜草料费由县统筹。开荒后三年不缴公粮，不出地租；（二）县工商局及县合作社，准备小菜、红白萝卜等菜籽及麦种，供应群众抢种需要。
