Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 18th. (Delayed News): A major bloodshed incident occurred at the Xuzhou Railway Station on the 22nd of last month, where over a thousand Chiang Kai-shek agents attacked more than four hundred students from the Jiangsu Education Institute. According to a detailed report from the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao's Xuzhou correspondent: Students from the Xuzhou Jiangsu Education Institute, in order to demand the school be converted into a national university, had repeatedly sent representatives to Nanjing to petition, but to no avail. The institute's four hundred-plus students then decided to collectively petition in Nanjing on June 22nd, having previously consulted with the school authorities and the Xuzhou Chiang Kai-shek party authorities. At 1 PM on that day, the entire group lined up and went to the train station, resting and waiting for the train in an orderly fashion on the open platform. At 2:30 PM, just as the students were distributing bread and sitting down to eat, suddenly over a thousand Chiang Kai-shek agents wearing uniforms but without symbols, along with dozens of plainclothes agents and several “officers” who appeared to be in command, spread out in a three-sided encirclement, and with a roar, charged towards the students, using belts, wooden sticks, and iron bars to beat them, kicking and punching; some even released police dogs to attack the students. The students had no way to escape, many suffering head injuries and swollen faces. Female students were also subjected to insults, and a large number of fountain pens and watches were snatched away. The violence lasted for four hours. After being besieged and beaten, the students were bound and arrested, and temporary restricted areas were designated for illegal interrogation. Out of the four hundred-plus students, over forty were immediately driven onto large trucks and taken to the Chiang Kai-shek Garrison Headquarters, while over a hundred went missing. Only over two hundred were released back to the school. Among the students who returned to the school, seven were seriously injured and in life-threatening condition, with countless others suffering minor injuries. After suffering this unreasonable and bloody suppression, the students held a meeting late that night to re-elect the Student Union Presidium, determined to continue the struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 19th. (Delayed) Shanghai News: The Shanghai Student Federation, regarding the U.S. Navy authorities' declaration of innocence for Pearson, the perpetrator who raped Ms. Shen, a Peking University student, issued a protest letter on June 28th, sending it to the Chiang Kai-shek government and the U.S. government, expressing serious protest and demanding the original verdict be upheld.

Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 20th. Tianjin News: The Chiang Kai-shek Garrison Headquarters in Tianjin has recently been wantonly arresting innocent citizens. On the morning of the 12th of last month alone, the department arrested 612 citizens under the pretext of "checking household registrations," causing widespread panic among the citizens.
