　　Wu'an Baisha Village
  　Spinning, Weaving, and Transporting for Millet, Leaving Seven Days of Grain Out of Ten
    [Report from this newspaper in Wu'an] The Third and Tenth Districts are actively organizing production to overcome simple frugality in preparing for famine. In Shuangyuquan Village in the Third District, each person has already gathered seventy catties of wild vegetables. Baisha Village has organized twenty-five livestock for transportation and sixty-one people to go down into the kilns. Weaving and spinning produces fifty catties of cloth every day. With this, they calculate that they can save seven days' worth of grain out of every ten days. At Guaitou Mountain, digging for medicinal herbs and cutting thatch earns 70,000 yuan per day. In Shaozhuang Village, twenty-seven people are cooperatively making shoe soles, earning 770,000 yuan in half a month. The Tenth District is now also building upon the "July 1st" meritorious service campaign as a foundation to overcome the famine, raising it to a higher level. The entire district is organizing the masses to collect locust flowers, estimating they can collect over fifty catties per person. Each catty can be exchanged with the government for two to two and a half catties of millet, which can be exchanged for approximately over 10,000 catties of millet. In addition, the village commune has not asked the masses for money since April 1st, and has instead earned 1.7 million yuan through its own production, spending only 700,000 yuan. Financial and grain cadres in the entire district are launching a meritorious service campaign, and it is expected that financial and grain work will achieve even better results.

　　武安白沙村
  　纺织运输换小米十天能余七天粮
    【本报武安讯】三、十两区积极组织生产克服单纯的节约备荒。三区双玉泉村每口人已打野菜七十斤。白沙村组织起二十五个牲口运输，六十一人下窑，纺织每天要出五十斤布，这样作他们计算一下，十天中能余七天粮。拐头山刨药材割白草，一天收入七万元。邵庄村有二十七人互助打作鞋底子的被子，半月收入七十七万元。十区现也正把“七一”的立功运动渡荒基础，向上提高，全区正组织群众采槐花，估计能采五十斤以上，每斤到政府换二斤到二斤半米，约可换米一万斤以上。此外和村公所从四月一日起，没向群众要款，而且自己生产赚了一百七十万，只开支七十万。全区财粮干部正在开展立功运动，预计财粮工作，将会收到更好的效果。
