Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 4th: The 600,000 military personnel and civilians in the Huai'an-Lianshui-Funing triangle area of northern Jiangsu completely smashed Chiang Kai-shek's army's 10,000-strong "mopping-up" operation after 25 days (May 20 to June 15) of arduous struggle, eliminating more than a thousand enemies. This time, the enemy gathered six main regiments and three security regiments of the 44th Division and the Reorganized 4th Division to launch an all-out attack. The People's Liberation Army of northern Jiangsu took the initiative to counterattack the Tongyu Road on May 23, forcing Funing into isolation. The Chiang Kai-shek troops in various parts of northern Jiangsu were panicked and rushed to reinforce Funing from Huai'an, Lianshui, Xiangshui Estuary and other places. The 177th Regiment of the Reorganized 4th Division occupied Suzui (southeast of Lianshui) on the 17th, and more than 200 people were wiped out the next day. The 175th Regiment was also blocked by local armed forces near Cheqiao (east of Huai'an), and the deployment of the western Chiang Kai-shek troops was disrupted. The remnants of the 179th Regiment of the 51st Division (this division was replenished after being wiped out in the Lunan Campaign) were forced to come to aid from Shuyang from a long distance. The three regiments of the 44th Division, which had just arrived in Funing, were also led by Wang Zejun, commander of the division, to Suzui. At this time, the People's Liberation Army had crossed the Yellow River to the north and penetrated the flanks of the division, causing Wang's troops to find nothing. On June 4, the People's Liberation Army once again captured Xiangshui Estuary (northeast of Xin'an County), an important town in northern Jiangsu, wiping out more than 600 enemies and shaking the overall situation of the "mopping-up". The 44th Division, the Reorganized 4th Division and other units were forced to withdraw to the three cities of Huai'an, Lianshui and Funing. The "mopping-up" was completely defeated. During these 25 days, the militia of each county from Majiadang in the south to the Yancheng Canal in the north coordinated to attack. 1,181 enemies were eliminated, 3 artillery pieces, 5 machine guns, 243 rifles, and more than 100,000 rounds of ammunition were seized.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 4th: You Chao, a reporter from the Northern Jiangsu Branch, reported: Chiang Kai-shek's 44th Division wantonly ravaged the people during the 25-day "mopping-up". After Chiang's troops were forced to withdraw from the Yilin line, the reporter immediately entered the "mopped-up" area. In the villages where Chiang's troops arrived, all ten houses were empty, and the residents' belongings that could not be moved were looted and destroyed. The oil press of the Gongxingzhuang Mass Cooperative, which was pulled by twenty-four horses, was completely destroyed by Chiang's troops. The wheat in the fields was ripe but not harvested, and the rice seedlings were already yellowing. Farmers in a village north of Jianyang Town who secretly harvested and planted were shot and killed or injured seven people by Chiang's troops. When the men were concentrated for detention, Chiang's troops raped women day and night. Zhang Wenshan's mute wife in Gongxingzhuang was raped by more than thirty Chiang's soldiers in shifts from dawn to dusk. Widow Ji in Jianyang Town was dying of illness and had already put on her shroud, but she was also raped to death by Chiang's soldiers in shifts.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 4th: During the 25-day "mopping-up" operation by Chiang Kai-shek's army, the 600,000 people in the Huai'an-Lianshui-Funing triangle area of northern Jiangsu bravely and cleverly protected materials and created many tragic deeds. Whenever Chiang's troops arrived in a place, they searched every household, from wooden cabinets to chamber pots, nothing was missed. There were also search teams with iron rods poking around in the fields, digging graves, turning over haystacks, and searching in rivers and ashes. Zhao Dun was searched and looted twenty-eight times in one day. However, the masses cleverly carried out a large-scale relocation of materials, moving them from indoors to outdoors, from above ground to underground. When the enemy went east, the materials were moved west, and when the enemy went west, the materials were moved east, making it impossible for Chiang's troops to find them. Tang Zhifa in a certain village moved the materials deposited by the government to three places in a row for three consecutive nights, and as a result, suffered no loss. The masses also created "earth telephones" to transmit information to each other. In addition to searching, Chiang's troops used severe torture to force confessions. Although many people were beaten to the point of near death, they did not utter a word. In Xiguang Village, Chiang's troops threw Xiao Danniang from the beams to the ground, but she did not speak; her body was stripped naked, and the skin sizzled when burned with four incense sticks, but she did not speak; Chiang's troops scraped her flesh with an axe while burning, but she still did not speak; Chiang's troops then hung her on the beams and beat her violently. She loudly said: "I am thirty-six years old this year, and I have sons and daughters. I can die now. Even if you beat me to death, I won't say anything." Chiang's troops had no choice but to leave empty-handed with their heads down.

　　苏北军民英勇苦斗二十五天
  　歼敌千余攻克响水口
    粉碎蒋军万人“扫荡”
    【新华社华中四日电】苏北淮（安）涟（水）阜（宁）三角地区六十万军民经二十五天（五月二十至六月十五日）苦斗，完全粉碎蒋军万人大“扫荡”，歼敌千余。此次敌纠集四十四师、整四师等部六个主力团三个保安团倾巢出犯，苏北人民解放军五月二十三日主动反击通榆路，迫使阜宁陷于孤立，苏北各地蒋军乃惊慌失措，急自淮安、涟水、响水口等地增援阜宁。整四师一七七团十七日进占苏嘴（涟水东南），次日即被歼二百余人。一七五团亦于车桥（淮安东）附近，被地方武装所阻击，西路蒋军部署乃被打散。五十一师一七九团残部（该师系鲁南战役被歼后补充者）被迫自沭阳远道来援。甫抵阜宁之四四师三个团，亦由该师师长王泽浚率领奔赴苏嘴，此时解放军已北渡于黄河，深入该师侧背，使王部扑空。六月四日解放军复一举攻克苏北重镇响水口（新安县东北），歼敌六百余，动摇“扫荡”全局。四四师、整四师等部乃相继被迫撤回淮（安）涟（水）阜（宁）三城，“扫荡”至此完全失败。在此二十五天内，南至马家荡北至盐河各县民兵均配合出击。歼敌一千一百八十一名，缴炮三门，机枪五挺，步枪二四三支，弹药十万余发。
    【新华社华中四日电】苏北分社记者尤超报导：蒋军四十四师在二十五天“扫荡”中大肆蹂躏人民的暴行称：蒋军被迫自益林一线撤退后，记者即进入被“扫荡”区内。蒋军所到村庄，十室十空，居民未能转移之物件，悉被掠夺破坏。公兴庄群众合作社油坊二十四匹马拖之榨油机，全被蒋军炸毁。田野间麦熟未收，而稻秧已呈枯黄，建阳镇北一村农民曾偷割偷种，即被蒋军击死伤七人。当男子被集中看押时，蒋军即不分昼夜，强奸妇女。公兴庄张文山的哑吧老婆，自明达旦，连遭三十余蒋军轮奸。建阳镇季寡妇得病奄奄一息，已穿上寿衣，亦遭蒋军轮奸而死。
    【新华社华中四日电】苏北淮（安）涟（水）阜（宁）三角地区六十万人民在蒋军延续二十五天的大“扫荡”中英勇机智保卫物资，创造许多悲壮事迹。蒋军每到一地，即挨户搜查，由木柜到便桶，无不搜过。另有手执铁杆搜索队在田野里乱戳，刨坟墓，翻草堆，河里、灰里找，赵墩一天即遭搜劫二十八次。但群众机敏地进行物资大搬家，从屋内搬到屋外，从地上搬到地下，敌人到东，物资搬到西，敌人到西，物资又搬到东，使蒋军无法找到。某村汤志发一连三夜，把政府寄存的物资搬三个地方，结果未受丝毫损失。群众更创造“土电话”互相传信。蒋军除搜索外，遂用严刑逼供。虽有许多人被打得死去活来，均只字未吐。西光村萧大娘蒋军把她从梁上掼到地下，她不说：身上剥光，用四股香烧得皮肤嗤嗤作响，她不说；蒋军一面烧，一面用斧头刮她的肉，她还在是不说；蒋军再把她挂在梁上毒打，她大声说：“我今年三十六岁了，儿子闺女都有了，死也死得了，就把我打死我也不说。”蒋军无法，只得垂头空手而去。
