    Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 15th. During the four months that Yuncheng was occupied by Chiang Kai-shek's army, more than a hundred farmers were brutally murdered, as has been verified. In Tangdian Village, northeast of the city, Zhao Yangchun, a local bandit leader under the command of Chiang's army, killed fifty farmers, burying thirty-five of them alive in a single pit. Landlords and local bullies in the fifth and sixth districts jointly carried out a massacre, seizing seven farmers at once, two of whom were sawn into three pieces, and five of whom were beheaded. The son of the old village head of Sidange Village was brutally murdered. The old village head shouldered a gun and joined the guerrillas, saying bitterly, "I'm not afraid of getting hurt when I go into the mountains to fight wolves." Chiang's army threw a Farmers' Association member into a water vat, threatening him to reveal the names of the association members, and pulling him out of the water to ask: "Are they at home or not?" The old farmer replied bluntly: "Even if you shoot me, they are not at home." On July 1st, the democratic government called on the farmers to rise up in armed struggle. In one day, nearly two thousand farmers joined the revenge squads, shouldering guns to strike at Chiang Kai-shek's bandits on both sides of the Nanda Dike, and capturing the local tyrant landlord returning home.
    Xinhua News Agency, Northwest, 15th. The Chiang Kai-shek-Hu bandit troops invading the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region have been implementing the utterly savage "seven-all" policy of looting all, eating all, burning all, driving all, grabbing all, raping all, and killing all since June in order to create a no-man's land. Twenty-four young people taken away from the second district of Zichang County were forced to wear military uniforms, carry heavy luggage and ammunition, and march rapidly, but were not allowed to drink water, so that most of them died of hunger and thirst. The Hu bandits who sneaked into Gaochuan and Wangjia villages in the seventh district of Ansai County did not burn firewood, but burned all the measures, dippers, scales, rolling pins, chopping boards, and carpenters' tools used by the masses. The enemy, fearing that their crimes would be settled by the people, also used various appeasement and deception tactics in the "cleared" areas. They would capture some of the masses, give them short-term training, give them a small amount of travel expenses, and release them, forcing them to promote how good the "National Army" was. They would also dress up some of the masses captured from distant villages as Hu soldiers who had violated discipline and publicly execute them in front of the crowd in order to confuse the masses. The enemy troops entrenched in Lijiaqu and Chaijiaya in Yan'an County pretended to give away donkeys looted from other places to the local masses, and gave the things looted from this family to that family in order to provoke relations between the masses. At the same time, they deliberately captured and detained the masses scattered far away, while releasing those nearby; they deliberately did not rob the few masses who had not been evacuated, but looted the homes of the masses who had been transferred. But no tricks could fool the masses. An old man in Gaochuan said: "I have lived for fifty or sixty years and have never seen such brutal troops. The hatred they have sown is too deep, and the day of retribution will not be far away."

    郓城人民奋起参加武装
    报复蒋匪残害无辜
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫十五日电】郓城在蒋军侵占的四个月中，农民惨遭屠害已查明者已有百余人，城东北唐店村，蒋军指挥土匪头子赵阳春杀死农民五十人，只在一个坑内就活埋了三十五人，五六区恶霸地主曾联合大屠杀，一次抓往七个农民，其中两个被铡成三节，五个被割下头来。四单垓村老村长的儿子惨遭杀害，老村长扛起枪来参加了游击队，痛愤的说：“上山打狼，就不怕受伤。”蒋军将农会委员投入水缸内，威胁他供出农会会员，淹一会儿又提出水面问：“他们在家不在？”老农民回答得干脆：“你枪毙我，他们也不在家。”七月一日，民主政府号召农民起来武装斗争，一天内就有近两千农民参加复仇队，扛起枪来打击南大堤两侧的蒋家匪徒，捕捉还乡团恶霸。
    【新华社西北十五日电】侵犯陕甘宁边区的蒋胡匪军，六月开始，穷凶极恶地厉行抢光、吃光、烧光、赶光、抓光、奸光、杀光之七光政策；以制造无人区。子长县西二区被拉走的二十四名青年被强迫穿上军衣背上沉重的行装弹药作急行军，却不准喝水，以至多半因饥喝而丧生，窜进安塞县七区高川和王家等村之胡匪，不烧木柴，而将群众日用的斗、升、秤、面杖、案板及木匠工具统统烧光。敌人害怕罪恶将受人民清算，又在清剿区施用各种怀柔欺骗。将捉去群众施以短期训练后，发给少数路费放回，强迫其向人宣传“国军”好，更将由远乡捉来的群众扮装成违犯纪律的胡军，公开当众处决，以迷惑群众。盘踞延安县李家渠和柴家崖的敌军，把别处抢来的毛驴假送给当地群众，把这家抢来的东西送给那家，以挑拨群众关系，同时故意将疏散在远处的群众捉住不放，近处的放回；对少数未及疏散的群众故意不抢，而将转移了的群众的家抢个精光。但任何骗术都瞒不过群众，高川一位老汉说：“我活了五六十岁没见过这样残暴的军队，种下的仇恨太深了，离报应的日子不会长远的。”
