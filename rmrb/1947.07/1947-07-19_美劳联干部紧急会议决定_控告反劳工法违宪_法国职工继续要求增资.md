Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 13th: Washington dispatch: 250 executives of the American Federation of Labor (AFL), in their recent emergency meeting, unanimously decided to abolish the slave-like anti-labor law and will sue in court that the bill is unconstitutional. The meeting decided to abolish all no-strike clauses in contracts from now on and will concentrate its efforts in future elections to defeat those legislators who ultimately made the Taft-Hartley Anti-Labor Act law. Furthermore, the Northern and Midwestern unions of the AFL's United Mine Workers of America formally signed new contracts with mine owners on the 8th, and the Southern union contracts were signed on the 9th, for a term of one year. The striking miners have therefore returned to work. As previously reported, the terms of the new contract are more favorable to the workers than before, which is indeed a major victory for American labor against the anti-labor bill passed by the U.S. Congress.

Another dispatch: The International Longshore and Warehouse Union, affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), called on its 12,000 Pomona workers to strike at midnight on the 11th due to failed wage increase negotiations. Eight factories are already on strike. It is estimated that, as a result of the strike, the loss of this highly perishable fruit will reach $500,000 per day. The union is demanding a wage increase of at least 15 cents per hour.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: TASS, Paris, 13th: The French government has yet to resolve the issue of wage demands from 1.2 million government employees, and negotiations are still ongoing. The French General Confederation of Labor (CGT) firmly demands that the government immediately decide on adjustments to wages and prices, and demands that a minimum wage limit be set, and that concrete plans for progressive economic and financial policies be established for tax reform and strict price controls. The CGT also demands that the 22 billion franc military budget be reduced to 15 billion francs. In addition, the government will also encounter the General Confederation of Agriculture's demand to set the price of wheat at 1,950 francs per 100 pounds. Yesterday, the French government set the price at 1,850 francs, a decision that is bound to cause dissatisfaction among farmers. A slowdown in grain deliveries may occur during the General Confederation of Agriculture's protests.

    美劳联干部紧急会议决定
    控告反劳工法违宪
    法国职工继续要求增资
    【新华社陕北十三日电】华盛顿讯：美劳工联合会二百五十位干部，顷在其紧急会议中一致决定实行废除奴役性质的反劳工法，并经过法院控告该法案之违反宪法。会议决定从此以后取消合同上一切不罢工的条款，并将集中力量在未来选举中打败那些最后使塔虎脱——哈特莱反劳工法案成为法律的议员。又美劳联所属之矿工联合会北部及中西部工会，已于八日与矿主正式签订新合同，南部工会合同则于九日签订，为期一年。罢工中之矿工因此已告复工。如前已报导者，新合同之条件对工人较前更为有利，此实为美国劳工反对美国会所通过之反劳工法案的一大胜利。
    另讯：产业工会联合会所属的国际码头与仓库工人工会，因增资谈判失败，于十一日号召其一万二千名波罗密工人在当日午夜罢工。现已有八厂罢工。据估计，由于罢工结果，此种最易腐烂水果之损失每日达五十万元。工会方面要求至少每小时增资一角五分。
    【新华社陕北十四日电】塔斯社巴黎十三日讯：法国一百二十万政府雇员要求政府修正工资问题迄未解决，刻仍在谈判中。法国总工会坚决要求政府立即决定调整工资和物价的决定，并要求订出最低工资的限度，及建立进步的经济财政具体计划以作税收之改革，严格实行物价管制。把二千二百万法郎的军费预算减低至一千五百万法郎。此外，政府还将遭遇到农业总联盟关于规定每百磅麦子为一千九百五十法郎价格的要求。而昨天法国政府则规定为一千八百五十法郎，这一决定势将引起农民的不满。在农业总联盟抗议时期可能发生对纳粮之怠工。
