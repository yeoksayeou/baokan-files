　　Summary of the Taiyue Militia's Participation in the War

　　In this Jinan Campaign, the militia directly dispatched and commanded by the Military Headquarters totaled 109 companies, with a total number of over 13,000 people. If the militia cooperating in combat north of Linfen Xiangling and along the Yellow River are included, there are 132 companies. The number of militia mobilized and the scale were the largest in the history of the Taiyue Region. The distance of the expedition and the length of time were also unprecedented. Qin County, located in the northernmost part of the region, had militia marching a thousand miles to the southernmost Maojin, Yongji, and Yicheng, with as many as twelve companies participating. Yangcheng, Jincheng, Shimin, Gaoping, Anze, and other counties also had more than eight companies. There have been significant improvements in weapon and ammunition equipment, as well as the establishment of command agencies, party and government agencies, and the provision of sanitation work. In particular, the strict organization was a relatively significant feature of this action, overcoming the past disorganized state of large actions with no means of livelihood and a chaotic rush. It was not only able to successfully complete the task, but also had unexpected gains in the consolidation and improvement of the militia itself. Ninety percent of the companies had no desertions, and the determination and seriousness in performing tasks were praised by all parties. In this participation in the war, many experiences were created:

　　A. Three major tasks of militia participation in the war:

　　First, direct combat coordination. In addition to assisting the troops with intelligence and communications, the main task is to eliminate the stubborn puppet district and village armed forces and administrative agencies, and at the same time deploy blockades of defeated soldiers. In addition to the general blockade, there should be key deployments. In the Yicheng operation, the entire county's militia acted separately, and after clearing all the stubborn puppet regimes and special agent armed forces, they immediately switched to intercepting defeated soldiers. Each village and each road had militia defenses. Xu Jian, director of the Military Commission, personally led two companies of militia to ambush at the border area where the enemy might escape to the county, and finally captured the stubborn regimental commander Zhang Fei. When the main force is pressing in, the militia can also take advantage of the enemy's panic, fire guns to intimidate and recover strongholds, which can give the attacking troops great convenience. The fact that the Xia County militia recovered and burned 47 bunkers in this way is a good example.

　　Second, undertaking logistics work to enhance the assault power of the troops. Eighty percent of the militia's strength in this participation in the war was engaged in logistics work, the most important of which was escorting prisoners and guarding warehouses. For long-distance escorts, the ratio should generally be one to five, with two-thirds of the force leading and one-third acting as perimeter guards. The attitude towards prisoners should be kind at ordinary times, but serious and strict when performing guard duties. Military orders must be executed.

　　Third, suppressing bandits, seizing transportation, and stabilizing social order. In the newly liberated areas, the stubborn puppet local armed forces and administrative organizations have not been completely destroyed. If they are not eliminated in time, they will be extremely harmful to the local people and will cause great difficulties to the troops. Therefore, local armed forces should be combined with the militia immediately, or the militia should be the main force with a few troops as the backbone to assist in forming bandit suppression troops. Generally, efforts should be concentrated first to eliminate bandits in groups, such as in southern Fen, where two companies of the division and ten companies of the militia formed a bandit suppression army. When the main force arrived, the stubborn bandits collapsed. After the bandits were eliminated, they were immediately dispersed to strengthen the county and district armed forces, establish political power, and eliminate scattered and lurking stubborn puppet personnel. Only by actively suppressing bandits in this way can the safety of towns and transportation be ensured. Simply stationing troops will suffer losses.

　　B. Issues of participation organization and command:

　　In this militia participation, the company was generally the unit. The administrative organization of the company was relatively sound, but the sanitary equipment and the structure of the battalion were poor. The sub-committee had no fixed unit, either directly leading a battalion or inspecting. Although the general committee participated in the logistics headquarters and specialized in commanding the militia, it was too busy with too few people and difficult to support. Based on this experience, the militia's war participation organization and command department have the following issues.

　　First, wartime organization mainly relies on peacetime preparation. Most of the companies' equipment and establishment were put together temporarily, which made it impossible to accumulate experience, improve the establishment, and improve the militia. This is a basic problem in the militia organization. Therefore, it is necessary to change the organizational form of the militia in the village and absolutely maintain the establishment during wartime. That is, to fix the establishment, fix the cadres, and fix the equipment. The village's guard militia and field militia should be separated. Those who cannot go on expeditions should be incorporated into the guard militia, and those who can go on expeditions should be organized into field squads according to the village, but the various classes of a village do not necessarily participate in one company, so as to avoid all the villagers' militia from leaving. A joint defense village can form a field company or platoon. The field militia still belongs to the leadership of the village armed committee when they return to the village, but the establishment must be maintained. The village armed committee can only ensure the execution of the field company's actions or concentrated training, and cannot hinder it. If there is a conflict between the village work and the field company work, the field company should be obeyed. If it is not the field company's activity time, it should still absolutely obey the leadership of the village armed committee. A field battalion is set up in the district, and a field regiment is set up in the county. Military, political, affairs, and sanitation cadres of the company, platoon, and class should be fixed. It is best to equip cadres above the battalion as well. One district cadre should participate in each company, and two district cadres should participate in each two companies. Each company, platoon, and class should be actively built. Weapons, ammunition, equipment, military uniforms, and even production funds should be fixed and built for a long time.

　　Second, the existing battlefield leadership organization is not adapted to such large-scale militia participation activities. It is difficult for a staff organization of the logistics headquarters with only four cadres to lead and command a hundred companies. Therefore, in the future, an armed department should be attached to the logistics headquarters, divided into staff, political work, and general affairs sections. The responsible cadres of the sub-committee should participate in the work of the armed department, either leading a part to perform separate tasks or inspecting various companies, but the armed department should uniformly assign work according to the situation.

　　Third, the sanitary equipment is too poor to cope with long-distance expeditions. Although the wounded are sent to military hospitals, collective long-distance diseases are a big problem. In this participation, forty of the seventy people in a company in Fushan became ill, which affected combat operations and morale. Therefore, reception centers should be organized in future expeditions, and convalescent homes should be organized in suitable locations. Each militia hospital should have a wartime organization.

　　Fourth, the issue of militia command is basically unified mobilization, so that it can directly command when performing special tasks, such as in this bandit suppression. Under normal circumstances, it is divided into various troops and closely combined with the command of each county, but it still maintains a certain independent system. After a period of task completion, it is still handed over to the armed department to avoid wasting military strength. Temporary attachments to various units, command, should also give tasks through the militia cadres. If necessary, the troops will send militia cadres to assist in administrative management, and the political work will still be the responsibility of the armed department. The troops can only help with liaison from the side. The military flags and bugle calls should be the same as the troops. The armed department should strengthen communication work and organize communication platoons to regularly contact various units. Other things such as military maps, flag bearers, and buglers are needed for expeditions and should be actively built.

　　(C) Political Work in War Participation:

　　The political work of the militia participating in this war has made progress compared to the past. Each company has established a party branch, and many companies have political instructors, deputy political instructors, workers, and political fighters. Therefore, in this battle operation, the mass discipline of the militia was relatively good, and many companies returned borrowed items, compensated for damaged items, and helped the masses produce. When the Yangcheng militia was stationed in Loujiazhuang, Linjin, they used the break to carry water and cut alfalfa for the masses, and launched a full-tank movement. Other counties have universally wiped and wrote slogans, disguised propaganda, and acted in dramas, especially the "Night Pearl" company in Yangcheng, and the companies in Anze, Tunliu, and Shimin did the best, ensuring the successful completion of the war participation task. Without the guarantee of political work, the completion of this war participation task would be unimaginable. Therefore, political work is the decisive key to the advance and retreat of the militia, and whether it gradually improves or gradually declines. Therefore, the construction of political work is absolutely indispensable in the militia.

　　However, the militia is different from the regular army, so the political work of the militia is also different from the political work of the regular army. It has the following characteristics:

　　First, the militia is a mass that does not leave production. He has to fight, and at the same time, he has to bear the problems of family production, food, and clothing. This is the basic characteristic that is different from the army. Therefore, it is inevitable that the militia has a greater selfishness. This time, a certain unit overestimated the militia's idea of making contributions and ignored the selfish aspects. It did not grasp the specific facts of each period to overcome the idea of "getting rich," and only later did it discover violations of discipline. On the contrary, the Yangcheng Night Pearl Company, they specifically made several rectifications of discipline in the process of carrying out tasks and made uninterrupted struggles against selfish concepts, so their company took a step forward. At the same time, since the militia are all farmers who have undergone the liberation movement and have a high degree of class consciousness, they express dissatisfaction with certain behaviors that violate mass discipline. If the leader can grasp this point, even if there are individual bad phenomena, it is not difficult to overcome.

　　Second, since the militia is a mass that does not leave production, his mass nature is particularly large. That is to say, it is necessary to fully estimate the peasant's average thinking and undisciplined disorganization, which is manifested in the militia's disobedience to leadership, extreme democracy, and liberalism. For example, the Qin County militia wanted to camp freely before reaching their destination, and it was necessary to discuss which village to live in; after a company in Jicheng sent prisoners back, they went home freely, and when it was time to cut wheat, a company in Fushan automatically returned sixty people, and so on. However, the military nature of the militia cannot be ignored. On the one hand, although they are farmers, they are farmers who have been trained by eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and one year of self-defense war. They cannot be compared with ordinary farmers. They not only understand military centralization, but also understand that individual interests are subordinate to overall interests. Without the support of these ideas, the military activities of a hundred companies far away from their hometowns would be impossible. Therefore, the obedience to orders and the resolute completion of tasks of this militia expedition are still the biggest features of this action.

　　Third, the militia is in the vast countryside for a long time, so the local concept of small groups is also quite serious. Shimin mobilized militia from four districts, four platoons from two districts, two platoons from one district, and one platoon from one district. When compiling the company, it can only be two companies and four platoons, one company and two platoons, and one company and one platoon. The cadres of this system took the militia to walk around and he heard a lot, but if you send an outside cadre, he suspected you, and even dared to ignore you. Therefore, the establishment in the militia is a very important issue. Secondly, the idea of going home is also a common characteristic of the militia, but it also has a progressive side, that is, "gloriously come out and gloriously go back." This idea is also common. A militiaman in Yangcheng was despised in the village because he did not have the qualifications to go on an expedition. He painfully requested several times before he got the right to go on an expedition; also, a platoon in Yangcheng was approved to go back first because they completed the task in a timely manner and the participation time was very long, but they also repeatedly asked to take a little task back to feel glorious, fearing that the villagers would criticize them for returning first was not glorious. Looking at the above, generally speaking, there are two kinds of thinking that dominate the expedition militia. One is to defend Chairman Mao and make contributions for the people, which is a good side and a basic progressive side; the other is the selfish "getting rich" idea. These two thoughts coexist, and these two thoughts rise and fall with each other. When there is an opportunity to get rich, the idea of getting rich rises, and when the mood is high and the atmosphere of making contributions is strong, the idea of making contributions also takes the upper hand. The question is how the leader grasps the above ideas, how to promote the militia's integrity, simplicity, and collective concept, that is, to promote the progressive side and overcome the backward side, and to make resolute struggles against bad ideas. For this reason, it is necessary to: (1) Carry out a meritorious service movement. This is the most effective working method to promote progress and overcome backwardness. Before the war, discussions on mass discipline should be launched as one of the main contents of meritorious service, challenge competitions after discussions, self-determined plans, continuous inspections during the execution process, and finally evaluations and records of meritorious service. In particular, the merits of the militiamen who have made meritorious service should be transferred to the village, and serious mistakes should also be transferred to the village. This is closely linked to the village, encourages morale, and at the same time conducts continuous education and ideological struggle to ensure the completion of all tasks is the main content of political work and the main task of the meritorious service movement. (2) Solve the family production of the expedition militia. Experience has proved that simply emphasizing meritorious service and not taking care of the militia's production is a utopian political work without a material basis. Therefore, solving the family production problem of the expedition militia is one of the main contents of the militia's political work. The best way to solve it is to implement the work ticket and travel ticket system. When there is a large amount of travel, the travel is not topped by the work, and in the production season, the work is not topped by the travel. Generally, one factory is one work. In principle, the whole village is disrupted, and the militia and the masses are calculated uniformly. Neither the masses nor the militia can be said to suffer losses. In addition, there should be close contact between the front and the rear. The rear should write more letters to report the family production situation, and the front should send representatives back to inspect the production, which will play a great role in consolidating morale. (3) War trophies should be properly handled. If the handling is improper, it will affect morale. Handling principles: (1) Resolutely and bravely complete the task, (2) Personally seize, (3) Wounded personnel; (4) Leaders who lead everyone to seize; (5) Suitable for needs; (6) If it is not needed by the militia, it should be used for the construction of all militia; Handling methods: Establish a war trophy handling committee, absorb the participation of the following, and make a little registration. The unified distribution is based on the battalion as the unit, the battalion handles, and the company handles when acting as the unit.

　　Finally, the political work organization, the company should set up a political instructor, the platoon should set up a worker, and the class should set up a political fighter. This is suitable for the militia to perform decentralized tasks. The political fighters form a political work group without setting up another name. The political work group has no administrative power, but only affects others with its own exemplary actions, not orders, and cannot be special. A turn-over group or a mutual aid group can also be established according to the situation, but it must be a free combination, because the peasants are most willing to rely on a few close people and are not afraid of suffering losses in tense situations.

　　太岳民兵参战总结
    此次晋南战役中由武总直接派遣和指挥之民兵共计一○九个连，总人数在一万三千以上，若连临汾襄陵以北及黄河沿岸配合作战的民兵统计在内，即有一三二个连，参战民兵调动之多和规模之大，为太岳区有史以来第一次，出征之远和时间之长也为历来所不及，沁县处本区最北面，而民兵千里远征直至最南面的茅津、永济、翼城，且参战民兵多至十二个连。阳城、晋城、士敏、高平、安泽等县也在八个连以上，武器弹药装备，以及指挥机构，党政机构的建立，和卫生工作的设备均有显著改进，特别是组织的严密为这次行动中比较显著的特点，克服了过去大行动中的生活无着和一哄而上的无组织状态，不仅能够顺利完成任务，在民兵本身的巩固和提高上也有意外收获，百分之九十的连队作到无一逃亡，而且执行任务的坚决和认真也为各方所赞赏。在此次参战中，创造了很多经验：
    甲、民兵参战的三大任务：
    第一、直接战斗配合，除以情报通讯协助部队外，主要是扫清顽伪的区村武装和行政机构，并同时布置堵截溃兵，除面的堵溃外，应有重点配备，这次翼城作战中，全县民兵分头动作，于扫清全部顽伪政权特务武装后，立即转入堵击溃兵，各村各路都有民兵防守，武委主任许坚并亲自率领民兵两个连埋伏于敌人可能向县逃跑的交界地区，卒获顽团长张飞。在大军压境时民兵亦可乘敌恐慌，打枪恐吓收复据点，这能给予进攻部队以很大便利。夏县民兵这样收复和燃毁碉堡四七座，即是很好范例。
    第二、担任后勤工作，增强部队突击力量，这次参战民兵百分之八十的力量担任了后勤工作，其中最主要的有押送俘虏，看守仓库等。长途押送，一般应为一与五之比，以三分之二兵力带领，三分之一兵力作外围警戒，对俘虏态度平时要和霭，在担任警戒任务时要认真严厉，要执行军事命令。
    第三、清剿土匪，缴获交通，安定社会秩序，在我解放了的新区，顽伪的地方武装和行政组织还未全部摧垮，如不及时扫除，对当地人民危害甚大，对部队也会造成很大困难，故应立即以地方武装与民兵结合，或以民兵为主抽少数部队作骨干，协助组成剿匪部队，一般应先集中力量消灭成股顽匪，如这次汾南，以分区两个连，民兵十个连，组成剿匪军，大军所至，顽匪即土崩瓦解，股匪消灭后，立即分散，加强县区武装，建立政权，肃清零散潜伏顽伪人员。只有这样主动清剿，才能求得城镇和交通的安全，单纯驻守是会吃亏的。
    乙、参战组织与指挥问题：
    这次民兵参战，一般是以连为单位，连的行政组织尚较健全，但卫生设备及营的机构较差，分会无固定单位，或直接率领一营，或巡视检查。总会虽参与后勤司令部，专事指挥民兵，但人少事多过于忙碌、颇难支持，根据这次经验，民兵的参战组织和指挥部有下述几个问题。
    第一、战时组织主要靠平时的准备。这次大部连队装备编制都是临时凑合，既无法积蓄经验，健全建制，又无法提高民兵，这是民兵组织中的一个基本问题，为此就必须转变村中民兵的组织形式，平时也要绝对保持参战时的建制，也就是要固定建制，固定干部，固定装备，各村的警卫民兵与野战民兵分开，不能出征者均编入警卫民兵，能出征者按村编成野战小组，但一个村的各个班不一定参加一个连，这样轮番调动，以免全村民兵都走。一个联防村可组成野战连排，野战民兵回村仍归武委会领导，但要保持建制，野战连要行动或集中训练，村武委会只有保证执行，而不能防碍，如村中工作与野战连工作矛盾时，应服从野战连，如非野战连活动时间，仍应绝对服从村武委会领导，区设野战营，县设野战团，连排班军事、政治、事务、卫生等干部均应固定，营以上干部最好也配备齐全，每出一连有一区干部参加，每出两连有两个区干部参加，各连排班应积极建设，武器弹药器材军服，甚至生产基金均应固定，并长期建设。
    第二、现有战地领导机构不适应这样大量民兵参战活动，仅有四个干部的后勤司令部的参谋机构，要领导和指挥一百个连很难胜任，因此今后应在后勤司令部附设武装部，下分参谋、政工、总务各科、分会负责干部均应参加武装部工作，或率领一部担任单独任务，或巡视各连，但由武装部按情况统一分配工作。
    第三、卫生设备太差，无法应付远征，虽伤员送部队医院，但集体远征疾病是很大问题，这次参战中，浮山一个连七十人病了四十人，影响了战斗行动和情绪，因此今后远征中应组织收容所，并选择适当地点组织休养所，各民兵医院均应有战时组织。
    第四、民兵指挥问题，基本上是统一调动，使在担任特殊任务时能直接指挥，如这次剿匪，一般情况下分制于各部队，和各县指挥部紧密结合，但仍保持一定独立系统，一个时期任务完成后，仍交回武装部，以免浪费兵力，临时附设各单位，指挥，也应通过民兵干部给予任务，必要时部队派民连干部协助行政管理，政治工作仍由武装部负责，部队只能从旁帮助联络，记号口令与部队应一致，武装部应加强通讯工作，组织通讯排经常与各单位取联系，其他如军用地图，旗手司号员等均为远征需要，应积极建设。
    （丙）参战中的政治工作：
    此次参战民兵政治工作较前进步，每个连队均建立党的支部，不少连队设有政指、副政指、工作员、政治战士等，因此这次战役行动中，民兵的群众纪律比较良好，还有不少连队作到借物送还，损物赔偿，帮助群众生产，阳城民兵在临晋楼家庄驻军时，利用休整空隙给群众担水割苜蓿，开展了满缸运动。其他各县都普遍的擦写标语、化装宣传、演剧、尤其阳城“夜明珠”连，和安泽、屯留、士敏等连队作的最好，保证了参战任务胜利完成。如果没有政治工作的保证，此次参战任务的完成是不可想象的，因此政治工作是决定民兵的前进与后退，是逐渐提高还是逐渐没落的决定关键，因此政治工作的建设，是民兵中绝对不可缺少的。
    但民兵和正规军不同，因此民兵的政治工作和正规军的政治工作也不同，它有以下的特点：
    第一，民兵是不脱离生产的群众。他要打仗，同时要担负家庭生产和吃穿问题，这是与军队不同的基本特点，因此民兵有较大自私性是必然现象。这次某单位过分估计了民兵的立功思想，而忽略自私性方面，没有抓紧各个时期具体事实克服“发洋财”思想，到后来检查，才发现违犯纪律行为。相反，阳城夜明珠连，他们在进行任务中，曾专门作了几次整顿纪律，和自私观念作了不间断的斗争，所以他的连队便提高了一步。同时由于民兵都是经过翻身运动而有高度阶级觉悟的农民，所以对别人某些违犯群众纪律的行为是表示不满的，如领导者能掌握这点，即使有个别不良现象，也是不难克服的。
    第二，由于民兵是不脱离生产的群众，他的群众性就特别大，也就是说，要充分估计到农民的平均思想和散漫无组织性，表现在民兵中的不服从领导，极端民主和自由主义等特点。如沁县民兵不到目的地就要自由宿营，住什么村庄还要经过讨论；冀城一个连送俘虏回来后，便自由回家，割麦时浮山一个连就自动回去六十人等等。但也不能忽视民兵军事性，一面他们虽是农民，但是他们是经过八年抗日和一年自卫战争锻炼出来的农民，不能和一般农民相比，他们不但懂得军事上的集中性，而且懂得个人利益服从整体利益。没有这些思想支持，一百个连的远离家乡的军事活动是不可能的，因此这次民兵远征服从命令和坚决完成任务，还是这次行动的最大特色。
    第三，民兵是长期处在广大农村，所以乡土观念小集团思想也相当严重。士敏调动四个区的民兵，两个区四个排，一个区两个排，一个区一个排，在编连时也只能是两个连四个排，一个连两个排，一个连一个排，本系统干部带上民兵走来走去他很听说，但要多派一个外来干部去，他曾怀疑你，甚至敢不理。因此民兵中的建制，实是很重要的问题。其次回家思想，也是民兵共同的特点，但也有他进步的一面，就是“光荣出来光荣回去”，这种思想也是共同的，阳城一个民兵因没有远征资格，在村内受人轻视曾几次痛苦请求，才得到远征权利；又阳城一个排因完成任务及时，参战时间又很长，批准他们先回去，但他们还几次要求带上一点任务回去才感到光荣，害怕村里群众批评他们先回来是不光荣的。综观上述，一般说有两种思想支配着远征民兵，一是保卫毛主席，为民立功思想，这是好的一面，也是基本的进步的一面；另一个是自私自利“发洋财”思想。这两种思想同时存在，这两种思想又互相消长，到有发财机会发财思想就抬头，到情绪高涨，立功空气浓厚时，立功思想也就占了上风，问题是在于领导者如何掌握上述思想，如何去发扬提倡民兵的正派，朴素和集体观念，也就是发扬进步的一面，克服落后的一面，对不良的思想作坚决的斗争，为此就必须：（一）开展立功运动，这是发扬进步，克服落后最有效的工作方法，战前应展开讨论群众纪律，作为立功主要内容之一，讨论后挑战竞赛，自订计划，在执行过程中，不断检查，最后评功记功，特别要把立了功的民兵功劳转到村中，犯了严重错误的也要转到村中，这样和村中紧密联系，鼓励士气，同时要进行不间断的教育和思想斗争，保证一切任务的完成，是政治工作主要内容，也是立功运动中的主要任务。（二）解决出征民兵的家庭生产，经验证明，单纯强调立功，不照顾民兵生产那是没有物质基础的空想的政治工作，因此解决出征民兵家庭生产问题，是民兵政治工作的主要内容之一。解决的最好方法，是实行工票与差票制度，在大支差时顶差不顶工，在生产季节时顶工不顶差，一般是一工厂一工，原则上是全村打乱，民兵和群众统一计算，群众和民兵都不能叫吃亏。除此以外，还有使前后方紧张联系，后方要多写信报告家庭生产情况，前方要推派代表回去检查生产，这对巩固情绪都起很大作用。（三）战利品要适当处理。如处理失当，就会影响情绪，处理原则：（一）坚决勇敢完成任务者，（二）亲自缴获者；（三）负伤人员；（四）领导大家缴获者；（五）适合需要；（六）如不为民兵们所需要者，应作为全体民兵建设之用；处理方法，成立战利品处理委员会，吸收下面参加，要作到点滴登记，统一分配者，以营为单位行动，以营处理，以连为单位行动者，以连处理。
    最后政工组织，连应设政指，排设工作员、班设政治战士，这样适合民兵执行分散任务，各政治战士组成政工组，不另立名目，政工组没有行政权，只是以自己的模范行动影响别人，而不是命令，更不能特殊，还可根据情况成立翻身组或互助组，但须是自由结合，因农民最愿依靠自己几个亲近人，就不怕在紧张情况下吃亏。
