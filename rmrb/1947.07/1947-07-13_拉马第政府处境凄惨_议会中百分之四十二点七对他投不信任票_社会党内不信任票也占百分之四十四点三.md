Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 9th: Comprehensive reports indicate that due to widespread dissatisfaction among all levels of French society with the government's various measures, causing serious economic and political unrest, Ramadier was forced to hold two confidence votes in Parliament and within the Socialist Party in quick succession. These two confidence votes revealed that the forces opposing the Ramadier government were very strong, and Ramadier only obtained two "miserable" votes of confidence. Ramadier requested the National Assembly on the 4th to hold a vote on his economic policies. In the recent confidence vote, after the French Communist Party members severely criticized the economic policies, the National Assembly, with 331 votes to 247, gave Ramadier only a majority of 84 votes. The vote reflected that, despite the support of the majority of the Socialist Party, the Popular Republican Movement, and the Radical Party, Ramadier was still unable to overcome the differences of opinion within the right-wing group he relied on, and even within his own Socialist Party. Combat reporter Tissier stated: This vote, although expressing confidence in the government, was "quite miserable." He also declared: "Many people believe that even if the danger is avoided, the interests of the government and France require the restoration of Communist ministers to the cabinet." The 42.7 percent no-confidence vote in Parliament forced Ramadier to urgently seek the support of the entire Socialist Party. On the 5th, the party's national congress opened. On the 6th, Ramadier delivered a speech to the congress, requesting "all assistance" for his plans. However, during the congress discussion, Ramadier's reactionary measures, such as relying on the United States, forming a government without Communist participation, weakening state control, and bowing to monopoly capital in his economic policies, were fiercely criticized by many party members. When the party congress held a vote on the 7th, the vote of confidence for Ramadier was even more miserable: out of 4,634 votes, as many as 2,058 votes were no-confidence votes, accounting for more than 44.3 percent of the total, a larger proportion than the opposition in Parliament. United Press commented: "This is the fourth confidence vote at the Socialist Party Congress, and it is expected to be the last."

    拉马第政府处境凄惨
    议会中百分之四十二点七对他投不信任票
    社会党内不信任票也占百分之四十四点三
    【新华社陕北九日电】综合报导：由于最近法国各阶层对政府的各种措施的广泛不满，引起了严重的经济的与政治的不安，逼得拉马第接连在议会和社会党内举行两次信任投票。在这两次信任投票中，显示了反对拉马第政府的力量甚为强大，拉马第仅获得了两次“凄惨”的信任票。拉马第于四日要求国民议会就其经济政策举行投票，在最近的信任投票中，在法共议员对该经济政策严加抨斥之后，国民议会以三百卅一对二百四十七票使拉马第仅得到八十四票的多数；当时投票反映出，虽有社会党、人民共和党及急进党三党中间多数的支持，拉马第仍无法克服其所投靠的右翼集团中、甚至其所属党社会党内部的意见分歧。战斗报记者蒂锡尔称：此次投票，虽对政府表示信任，却是“颇凄惨的”。并宣称：“许多人认为，即使危险被避免了，但政府及法兰西的利益，均要求在内阁中恢复共产党的部长职位。”议会中百分之四十二点七的不信任票，迫使拉马第急需社会党全党的支持。五日，该党全国代表大会开幕，六日拉马第向该会发表演说，要求对他的计划“给予一切援助”。可是，大会讨论中，拉马第的投靠美国、组织无共产党人参加的政府、削弱国家管制和向垄断资本屈膝的经济政策等等反动措施，遭到了许多党员的猛烈抨击。该党大会在七日举行表决时，对拉马第所投的信任票更为凄惨：在四六三四票中，投不信任票的竟达二○五八票，占总数百分之四十四点三以上，比议会中的反对派比例还大。合众社对此评称：“这是社会党大会第四次信任投票，而且预料这将是最后一次。”
