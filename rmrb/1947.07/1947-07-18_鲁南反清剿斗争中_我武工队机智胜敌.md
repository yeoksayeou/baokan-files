    Lunan Anti-"Encirclement and Suppression" Struggle
    Our Guerrilla Unit Cleverly Defeats the Enemy
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 16th] Many models of persistent struggle have emerged in the Lunan anti-"encirclement and suppression" battles. Zheng Naibin, the district chief of Zou County × District, was "encircled and suppressed" by 700 enemies on the 4th. He and eight members of the armed work team defended the Eight Peaks (the highest peak of Cuishan Mountain east of Zoucheng). When the enemy surrounded them on three sides—east, west, and north—he fought alone, ordering the other team members to transfer to safety. The enemy then used firepower to seal off the peak on all four sides. He relied on the walled village for resistance. When seven Chiang soldiers climbed close to the village wall, he killed two of them with a hand grenade. The remaining five were so frightened that they rolled down the mountain. He then placed his felt hat on another section of the village wall and waved his jacket, causing the enemy to fire intensely at the hat, afraid to approach. By dusk, District Chief Zheng had safely transferred, having killed or wounded a total of seven enemies. Gu Guangting, director of the Armed Forces Committee of Lushui (newly established county, east of Teng County) × District, and more than ten members of the armed work team were surrounded by the enemy on the Baodufeng, which is more than forty feet high, on June 7th. The enemy fired more than forty artillery shells at the peak but never dared to approach. Finally, they sent a letter to induce surrender, which was sternly rejected by Gu and others. Persisting until dusk, Gu had a stroke of inspiration, weaving bed sheets into cloth ropes and tying them to the rocks and trees on the cliff. He then led everyone down the cliff, and the entire team returned in triumph.

    鲁南反清剿斗争中
    我武工队机智胜敌
    【新华社山东十六日电】鲁南反“清剿”战斗中涌现不少坚持斗争模范。邹县×区区长郑乃斌四日遭敌七百“围剿”，他和武工队员八人扼守八顶峰（邹城东边翠山的最高峰），当敌将东西北三面包围时，他一人抗击，叫其他队员安全转移。敌复将该峰四面用火力封锁，他凭借围寨阻击，七个蒋军爬近寨墙，他用一个手榴弹炸死其二，余五人，吓得滚下山去。又把自己的毡帽放在另外寨墙上，把褂子挥着，敌以密集火力向毡帽射击，不敢近前。直到黄昏，郑区长安全转移，共毙伤敌七人。麓水（新设县，在滕县东）×区武委会主任顾光亭与武工队员十余人于六月七日被敌包围于高达四十余丈之抱犊峰上，敌向该峰发炮四十余响，终不敢接近，最后送信诱降，也遭顾等严拒。坚持到黄昏，顾急中生智，将被单织成布绳，拴于石崖树上，率领大家顺崖滑下，全队凯旋而归。
