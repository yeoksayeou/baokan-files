　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 3rd: According to Tianjin newspaper reports last month: Many provinces in the Chiang-controlled areas are facing fiscal deficits. Hebei Province's budgeted expenditure for this year is 69 billion yuan, not including local subsidies. The Chiang Central Government has approved a subsidy of 35 billion yuan, which includes 6 billion yuan for local subsidies, but the provincial government has only actually received 29 billion yuan. It is claimed that the province's tax revenue is completely non-existent, so apart from the subsidy received, there is a shortfall of 40 billion yuan. Suiyuan Province's budgeted expenditure for this year is 17 billion yuan, with revenue of only 2.8 billion yuan. From January to May, the Chiang Central Government provided a monthly subsidy of 840 million yuan, totaling 4.2 billion yuan, leaving a shortfall of 10 billion yuan for the entire year. The burden on the people in the Chiang-controlled areas of Hebei and Suiyuan is therefore becoming even more severe.

　　蒋区冀绥等省
  　财政入不敷出
    【新华社陕北三日电】据上月津报息：蒋区各省财政多入不敷出。冀省今年预算支出六百九十亿元，尚不包括地方补助额，蒋中央允许补助三百五十亿元，系包括地方补助六十亿元在内，实际该省府仅获补助二百九十亿。据称该省税收完全无着，故除所得补助外，不敷四百亿。绥省今年预算支出一百七十亿元，收入仅二十八亿元。一至五月蒋中央每月补助八亿四千万，共四十二亿，全年差额尚达一百亿。冀绥蒋区人民负担因之更见苛重。
