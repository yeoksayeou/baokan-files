    The bugle call of the great counter-offensive has sounded. As we jointly celebrate the 26th anniversary of our Party, the bugle call of the great counter-offensive of the Chinese people has sounded. The powerful field army of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has begun to launch a broad frontal assault with thunderous force on the reactionary派's fragile defense line. Starting simultaneously from Daoqing in the west to Liangshan in the east, it has achieved two major victories in eight days. The first is the breakthrough of the natural barrier of the Yellow River, which the People's Liberation Army executed as a major combat mission. This task was accomplished very successfully. In one day and two nights, the large army smoothly completed the crossing of the river in the face of the enemy and has now established a strong beachhead with a width of more than 200 miles and a depth of more than 100 miles on the south bank of the Yellow River. This is a huge victory and will occupy an important place in the history of the Chinese people's revolutionary war. Following the successful crossing of the river, the People's Liberation Army captured eight cities in eight days, namely Yun, Juan, Ju, and Cao in western Shandong, and Qin, Bo, and Mengzhucheng in northern Henan. The battle of Yuncheng, in particular, was the most outstanding, wiping out two enemy brigades in one fell swoop and creating a brilliant record for a single unit of the People's Liberation Army of annihilating two enemy brigades at one time. The initial victory of the counter-offensive was thus laid, and the entire area rejoiced when the good news came. We extend our cordial greetings to the commanders and fighters, guerrillas, people's armed forces, and participating masses who fought bravely on the two front lines of Jin-Lu-Yu and northern Henan!
    People will not forget that it was on this day last year that the Kuomintang reactionaries began a large-scale civil war offensive against our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Liberated Area. Jiang and Hu's troops, with ten brigades, advanced north along the Tongpu Railway from Yuncheng, attacking Houma; at the same time, in southwestern Shandong, Chiang Kai-shek was also drawing up a large army to deploy an offensive. Chiang Kai-shek's boast at the time was: to solve the CCP within five months and to open up the Ping-Han, Jin-Pu, and Tongpu three lines within three months, his arrogance reaching its extreme; but in just one year, history has undergone a 180-degree turn, and where Chiang Kai-shek's arrogance has now disappeared to!! After a year of the people's earth-shattering struggle, history has declared the complete bankruptcy of Chiang Kai-shek's strategic plan: the war situation is no longer from south to north, but a sharp turn from north to south; the task of opening up the Ping-Han and Tongpu lines is no longer to be completed by the reactionaries, but is being and will be completed by the people. Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary faction has been forced to change from a full-scale offensive strategy to a key offensive strategy, and then to a full-scale defensive strategy, gradually turning to a key defensive strategy. In tactics, from a quick battle and quick resolution, they were forced to change to a strategic offensive and tactical defense, and then to a steady advance and fierce attack and a steady and solid advance, gradually turning to pure defense, passively taking beatings, to be defeated by the People's Liberation Army one by one. In this year, the Chiang army lost enough 300,000 men on the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu battlefield, and decisive changes in both quality and quantity occurred within the Chiang army, which is the most fatal move to the Chiang army. On the people's side, over the past year, our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu army and people have implemented Chairman Mao's policy of exchanging space for the enemy's living strength, preserving ourselves and eliminating the enemy, not only annihilating 300,000 enemies, but also strengthening ourselves unprecedentedly. In one year, while fighting, we built the army, increasing our military strength by more than two-fifths, and trained a powerful field army that is invincible in all battles. In addition, before entering the great counter-offensive, we had already recovered most of the lost territory and expanded a considerable number of new liberated areas. Now the four areas of southern Hebei, Taihang, Taiyue, and Yu-Wan-Su have been completely restored and have surpassed the situation in July last year. The above illustrates a basic situation: the reactionaries have been baring their fangs and claws for a year, but they have ended up losing both men and land, with the result of being burned by flames. The storm of the people's great counter-offensive is decisively coming, and no force can stop it!
    Chiang Kai-shek has tried every means to prevent the people's great counter-offensive, pinning all his hopes on the Yellow River. It is said that a Yellow River water was prepared to be used as 400,000 soldiers, but Chiang Kai-shek never expected the Yellow River to be so useless, not even playing the role of a single brigade. Chiang Kai-shek hurriedly deployed two lines of defense south of the Yellow River: the first line of defense was guarded by two divisions of Liu Ruming's miscellaneous army from Heze via Juancheng to Yuncheng; the second line of defense was filled by three divisions of Wang Zhonglian, who were drawn from northern Henan overnight, from Kaocheng via Dingtao and Shanxian to Jinxiang, including miscellaneous troops and direct descendants, with miscellaneous troops being in the majority in general. Now, because the 55th Division of Yuncheng was annihilated and Juye was captured by us, the right wing of the Chiang army has been broken through, causing the entire front line to fall into disarray. The blue arrow of our army has pointed near the front of the second line of defense of the Chiang army. The Chiang army is facing two major crises: first, if the Chiang army cannot invest new reserves and can only use the existing forces to defend, it is extremely dangerous. The vast majority of these troops have been given many devastating blows by the People's Liberation Army, their will to fight is low, and especially many miscellaneous troops have undergone tremendous qualitative changes; second, if the Chiang army cannot control the second line of defense, then it will be difficult to defend the Longhai Railway, and the entire defense system will collapse. In the face of this dual crisis, Chiang Kai-shek's most profound contradictions are: insufficient troops; inadequate reserves; all battlefields are simultaneously suffering fatal blows from the People's Liberation Army, unable to transfer troops; morale is declining day by day, and there is widespread war weariness, so that Chen Cheng had to shout loudly in this year's "July 7th" message to the Kuomintang officers and soldiers, proposing: we must "clarify the complex peace thoughts" as the central task. These will all prompt the Chiang army to increasingly move towards the prospect of dismemberment!
    The war situation has changed so rapidly! The people are fighting so bravely! Making the new stage that we have been looking forward to day and night for the past year finally arrive! We have climbed to the top of the mountain, and Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary faction appears so small and weak in the face of the people's great counter-offensive! We hereby call on the army and people of the entire area: act bravely, win bravely, recognize the current reality, and adapt our thinking and work to the needs of the current great counter-offensive; our slogan is: fight with all our strength for the victory of the great counter-offensive! We must devote all our efforts to completing the three major tasks of combat, land reform, and production. All commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army must further improve their combat effectiveness, completely annihilate all the Chiang troops invading our liberated areas, learn to use Chairman Mao's military thinking, learn and master both mobile warfare and positional warfare, continue to expand the liberated areas; must strengthen the construction of military regions, develop guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas, launch guerrilla warfare in the KMT-controlled areas, and fully organize and guarantee the completion of the task of supporting the front lines; must continue to completely eliminate feudalism, oppose the almost hopeless thinking, and the leadership must effectively support cadres and the masses, continue to conduct re-examination, resolutely implement the policy of uniting with the middle peasants, to ensure the rapid, universal, and thorough realization of the task of tilling the land for those who cultivate it in the entire area (including the occupied areas); we must implement the Central Bureau's instructions on production and frugality, and we must make achievements in this work to support the long-term war and prevent the attack of drought. In order to complete the above three major tasks and realize the victory of the counter-offensive, we also call on the entire area to widely launch a counter-offensive campaign to make meritorious service; comrades! The bugle call of the great counter-offensive has sounded! March forward bravely! Contribute everything to the people's cause of liberation, and strive to make meritorious service for the people!

### 大反攻的号声响了  庆祝反攻初捷

    大反攻的号声响了
    庆祝反攻初捷
    正当我们同声庆祝我党二十六周年纪念之际，中国人民大反攻的号声响了。中国人民解放军晋冀鲁豫强大野战军开始以雷霆万钧之势，向反动派脆弱的防线，作宽大正面的出击，西起道清，东迄梁山，同时开始行动，八日之间，已取得两次大捷。首先是黄河天险的突破，人民解放军对此是当作一个重大战斗任务遂行的。这一任务完成得非常完满，一日两夜之中，庞大的军队已顺利完成敌前渡河，现已在黄河南岸横宽二百余里，纵深百余里地带建立强大滩头阵地。这是一个巨大的胜利，将在中国人民革命战史上占有重要地位。随着渡河作战成功，人民解放军于八天之内又攻克八城，即鲁西之郓、鄄、钜、曹，豫北之沁、博、孟诸城，尤以郓城之战一举歼敌两个旅，最为优异，创造人民解放军单个兵团一次歼敌两个旅的光辉纪录。反攻初战胜利由此奠定，捷报传来，全区欢腾，我们谨向冀鲁豫及豫北两前线英勇战斗之将士及游击队，人民武装，参战群众致亲切的敬礼！
    人们当不致忘怀，正是去年的今天，国民党反动派开始对我晋冀鲁豫解放区发动大规模的内战进攻，蒋、胡军以十旅之众自运城沿同蒲线北进，向我侯马进攻；对鲁西南，蒋介石亦正在抽集大军部署进攻。蒋介石当时吹的牛皮是：五个月内解决中共，三个月打通平汉、津浦、同蒲三线，其气势之嚣张几达于极点；但仅仅一个年头，历史就发生了一百八十度的转变，蒋介石的这些气焰现在已不知烟消云散到何处去了！！在人民一年来惊天动地的奋斗之后，历史宣布了蒋介石战略计划的彻底破产：战局已非由南而北，而是由北向南急转直下；打通平汉、同蒲的任务，已非由反动派完成，而是由人民正在和即将完成。蒋介石反动派在战略上由全面攻势战略被迫一变为重点攻势战略，再变为全面防御战略，逐渐将转到重点防御战略。在战术上，由速战速决被迫一变为战略进攻战术防御，再变为稳扎猛打和稳扎稳打，正逐渐转为单纯防御，被动挨打，为人民解放军各个击破。这一年，蒋军在晋冀鲁豫战场损兵折将足够三十万人，蒋军内部发生了质与量两方面的决定性的变化，这是对蒋军所将的最致命的一军。在人民方面，一年来我晋冀鲁豫军民实行毛主席以空间换取敌人有生力量，保存自己消灭敌人的方针，不仅歼敌三十万，而且空前壮大了自己。一年之中，一面战斗一面建军，增加军力五分之二以上，锻炼出一支无战不胜的强大野战军。此外，还在没有进入大反攻以前，我们已收复了大部分失地并扩大了相当数量的新解放区，现在冀南、太行、太岳、豫皖苏四个地区已完全恢复并超过去年七月的态势。以上说明了一个基本形势：反动派一年来张牙舞爪，却落得个人地两失，烈火焚身的结果。人民大反攻的狂风暴雨是决定性的到来了，任何力量阻挡不得！
    蒋介石曾经千方百计来阻挡人民的大反攻，将全部希望寄托在黄河身上，据说一条黄水准备当作四十万大兵用的，但蒋介石万万没有想到黄河竟如此不中用，连一旅人的作用也没发挥。蒋介石急忙又在黄河以南布置了两道防线：第一道防线从荷泽经鄄城到郓城以杂牌军刘汝明两个师守备；第二道防线从考城经定陶单县到金乡，以豫北星夜抽过来的王仲廉三个师填防，其中有杂牌，有嫡系，总的说来杂牌居多数。现在第一道防线因郓城五十五师之被歼，钜野被我攻克，蒋军右翼已被突破，以至整个战线陷于溃乱。我军之蓝色箭头已指近蒋军第二道防线的前沿。蒋军正面临着两大危机：第一蒋军如不能投入新的后备，只能以现有兵力担任防御，是极其危险的，这些部队绝大多数是经过人民解放军给过多次歼灭性打击的，战意低下，特别是许多杂牌军已经发生了极大的质的变化；第二如蒋军不能控守第二道防线则陇海线亦势难防守，整个防御体系将会崩溃。在这双重危机面前，蒋介石的最深刻的矛盾是：兵力不足；后备不济；各个战场同时遭受人民解放军致命打击，不能转用兵力；士气日低，普遍厌战，以致陈诚不得不在今年“七七”告国民党官兵书中大声疾呼提出：必须“澄清复杂的和平思想”为中心工作了。这些均将促使蒋军日益走向肢解的前途！
    战局变化的如此迅速！人民如此勇敢战斗！使我们一年来所日夜期待的新阶段终于到来了！我们已爬上了山顶，蒋介石反动派在人民大反攻面前已显得如此渺小懦弱！我们特向全区军民号召：勇敢的行动起来，勇敢的胜利，认清当前的现实，使我们的思想和工作适应当前大反攻的需求；我们的口号是：全力为大反攻胜利而斗争！我们要全力完成作战、土地改革、生产工作三大任务。人民解放军全体指战员必须进一步提高战斗力，彻底全部歼灭进犯我解放区的蒋军，学会运用毛主席的军事思想，学习和熟练运动战和阵地战两套本事，继续扩大解放区；必须加强军区工作建设，发展沦陷区游击战争，开展蒋管区游击战争，全力组织和保障支援前线任务的完成；必须继续彻底消灭封建，反对差不多没搞头的思想，领导上切实给干部和群众撑腰，继续进行复查，坚决贯彻联合中农的政策，以保证耕者有其田任务在全区（包括沦陷区）的迅速普遍彻底实现；必须贯彻中央局生产节约指示，必须将这一工作做出成绩来才能支持长期战争，防备旱灾的袭击。为了完成上述三大任务，实现反攻胜利，我们并号召全区广泛开展一个反攻立功运动；同志们！大反攻的号声响了！勇敢前进！为人民的解放事业贡献自己的一切，为人民努力立功！
