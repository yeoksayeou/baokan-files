　　Yunju New District Accuses and Seeks Revenge
    [This newspaper's Ji-Lu-Yu 21st dispatch] After our army recovered Yunju, the masses demanded to oppose traitors and seek revenge. Huang'an in Yunju was occupied by the 55th Division and 86th Regiment of the Chiang army, as well as Yang Hengchang and other local reactionaries’ "Homecoming Legion," "Gun Society," and "Special Agent Team." In the past four months, more than 250 people around Huang'an were shot, slashed, or buried alive, and the rape of women was commonplace. Landlords and bad elements took the opportunity to seize the land and grain of the masses. The regular burden was more than 30 jin per mu, and miscellaneous taxes, levies, and extortions were several times more than the regular tax. Young and middle-aged men were conscripted to build bunkers and dig trenches all day long. According to statistics, 200,000 labor days were conscripted in Huang'an. When the green gauze tents rose in June, the enemy, fearing our activities, forced the masses to pull out the sorghum near the strongholds. On July 1, Chiang's army and bad element agents, hearing that our army had crossed the river, fled in panic, and took the "Gun Society" which was formed by forcing young and middle-aged men from various villages, away from Huang'an to Caozhou. After our army recovered the area, local work comrades rushed to Huang'an on the second day and convened a mass meeting to expose the enemy's deceptive propaganda and express a lenient attitude towards the deceived "Gun Society." After the meeting, the masses came to the county magistrate one after another, demanding revenge. An old woman said: "My son, Zhang Xuequan, was the youth director in the village. Bad landlords grabbed him and buried him alive at Yang Hengchang's place. Even when he was dying, he shouted for revenge on his behalf." The old woman went on to say: "The land has been seized by the landlords, and there is nothing to eat at home, so I fled to Wangzhuang. The landlord of Wangzhuang said that I was a family member of the Communist Party and drove me out of the village and would not let me live there." According to the demands of the masses, the county government immediately issued a notice, calling on those with grievances to seek redress, and those with enemies to seek revenge. The government strongly supported the masses and launched a movement to accuse and seek revenge.

　　郓巨新区诉苦复仇
    【本报冀鲁豫二十一日电】我军收复郓巨后，群众要求反奸复仇。郓巨黄庵为蒋军五十五师，八十六团，和杨恒常等还乡团、杆子会、特务队所盘据。四个月来，黄庵周围群众遭受枪杀刀刮活埋者在二百五十人以上，妇女被奸淫更是平常的事。地主坏蛋则乘机倒了群众的地和粮食，正负担每亩三十多斤，而杂税勒索讹诈比正税还多几倍。青壮年被拉去，整天修碉堡挖沟。据统计，黄庵被拉民夫达二十万个工。六月青沙帐起，敌人怕我活动，强迫群众把据点附近高粱拔去。七月一日，蒋军和坏蛋特务们听说我军已过河，即拔腿逃窜。并将强迫各村青壮年成立的“杆子会”，撤离黄庵，带往曹州去了。我军收复该地后，地方工作同志赶到黄庵的第二天，召开了群众会，揭发敌人的欺骗宣传，表明对被欺骗的“杆子会”之宽大态度。会后，群众纷纷来找县长，要求报仇。一个老太太诉说：“俺儿张学全在村上当青年主任，坏地主把他抓到杨恒常那里活埋了，临死的时候，还喊着给他报仇。”老太太接着又说：“地都叫地主倒去了，家里没啥吃，就逃到王庄去。王庄的地主说俺是共产党的家属，把俺赶出庄来，不叫俺住。”县政府根据群众要求，随即出布告，号召有冤的报冤，有仇的报仇，政府大力为群众撑腰，展开诉苦复仇运动。
