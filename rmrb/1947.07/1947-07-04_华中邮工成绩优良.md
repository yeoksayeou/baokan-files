Xinhua News Agency, Hua Zhong, 29th. Hua Zhong's postal workers, who remained behind the enemy's lines, persisted in their work and achieved remarkable feats. The Subei Sub-district implemented the "People Don't Stop, Mail Doesn't Stop" system, delivering mail within 100 li on the same day. In the Eleventh Sub-district by the Yellow Sea, spanning 100,000 square li, one could read the Yellow Sea Daily of the sub-district on the same day. Transportation personnel on the Hai-Tai line braved the extremely cruel third phase of the anti-"mopping up" campaign, traveling at night between pillboxes, sometimes crossing rivers naked in freezing nights. For half a year, every letter was delivered on time. Transportation personnel in Dongtai implemented a "Rest the People, Don't Rest the Vehicles" system, enabling newspapers and letters to be delivered to areas 200 li away in a single day. Postal workers in the border areas risked their lives to complete their tasks. Li Dezhong, a postal worker in Sheyang, traveled back and forth across the Tongyu Road, a transportation line occupied by the enemy, twenty times in a month. He was discovered by the enemy six times, but cleverly escaped each time. Wang Yuanzhu, a model postal worker in Huaihai, was carrying a confidential urgent letter across the blockade line in March when he was discovered by the enemy. He immediately swallowed the letter. He was then severely beaten by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, his clothes stained with blood, but he did not utter a word. After being released and resting for a short time, he resumed delivering letters. Zhou Fengzhang, a postal worker in Qu Xia district of Taixing, remained within the enemy's "encirclement" for two days and two nights without sleep, yet still managed to break through and deliver four urgent letters.

　　华中邮工成绩优良
    【新华社华中二十九日电】华中蒋后邮工坚持工作卓著功勋。苏北分区执行“人不停，信不停”制度，百里内当天送达，黄海边之十一分区，纵横十万平方里，当天可看到本分区的黄海日报。海泰线南交通工作人员，在极残酷的三期反“清剿”中，深夜穿行碉堡间，有时冰夜裸体过河，半年来每封信都如期送达。东台交通工作人员“歇人不歇车”，可将报纸信件于一天内送到二百里外的地区。边沿区邮工更出生入死完成任务。射阳邮递员李德忠一月内来往蒋占交通线通榆路两侧二十次，曾六次被敌发觉，均机敏逃脱。淮海模范邮递员王元柱，三月间带一机要快信过封锁线，为敌发觉，当即将信吞下。后遭蒋军毒打，衣衫血赤，未说出一字。获释后休息不久，又恢复送信。泰兴曲霞区邮工周峰章，在敌“围剿”圈中，两天两夜未睡，仍冲出送快信四封。
