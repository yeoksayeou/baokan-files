　　Learn from Postal Worker Wang Wenju!
  　Organize Farmers' Reading Groups
    [This newspaper, Qixian News] Comrade Wang Wenju of the county post office thinks every day about how to develop newspaper sales. When he goes on business trips, he is very fast. Every time he goes to the Yushe connecting point, he always returns quickly from the 130-mile round trip. In addition to being fast, he also takes advantage of meal times in the countryside to go into the crowds, bringing the People's Daily, Xinhua News, and People's Pictorial, to tell the masses about the victory news on the newspapers, and to explain the farmers' liberation issues in conjunction with the People's Pictorial. After patient propaganda, he organizes reading groups. In Maihe Village, Lü Erdan said: "Organizing a reading group is possible, but I don't have the money to subscribe to the newspaper!" Wang Wenju said: "As long as you save money by not smoking cigarettes and produce more, isn't that enough money to subscribe to the newspaper?" Under his patient propaganda, Lü Erdan's thinking was cleared, and Lü Erdan and three others also organized a reading group and subscribed to one copy of the People's Daily. After returning to the office, Wenju happily talked about the experience of organizing the reading group. He said: "As long as there is propaganda, there will be a way. I plan to develop seven copies of the People's Daily and Xinhua News in June." His spirit was praised by everyone.

　　学习邮工王文举！
  　组织农民读报组
    【本报祁县讯】县邮局王文举同志每天思想着如何去发展报纸销路，在出差方面，速度很快，每次往榆社接头点，总是往返一百三十里路，很快就回来了。除速度快外，还要在乡村趁吃饭的时间到群众人群里，带着人民报、新华报，与人民画报，给群众说报纸上的胜利消息，配合着人民画报讲农民翻身问题，耐心的宣传后，就组织读报组。买河底村，吕二旦说：“组织读报是可以，就是没钱订报！”王文举说：“只要节约不吃纸烟，多生产，还不够订报钱吗？”在耐心宣传下，打通了吕二旦的思想，吕二旦等四人也组织了一个读报组，订了人民日报一份。文举返局后很高兴的说着组织读报组经过，他说：“只要宣传就有办法，我计划六月份要发展人民报、新华社七份”。他的精神大家都很赞扬。
