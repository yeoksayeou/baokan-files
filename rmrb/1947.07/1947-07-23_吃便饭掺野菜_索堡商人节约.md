　　Eating Simple Meals with Wild Vegetables
  　Suobao Merchants Practice Frugality
    [Report from Shexian by Our Newspaper] Since the Suobao Town Businessmen's Association proposed drought resistance and famine preparedness, merchants discussed the matter at the people's school. Twenty restaurants proposed to promote the experience of weathering the famine in 1942 and 1943, not only to make money for themselves but also to take care of the masses. They stopped selling fried dough sticks and advocated eating simple meals. The Fuli and Derongchang restaurants proposed that they would no longer sell meat or stir-fried dishes to reduce waste among the masses. The Xinglong Cigarette Factory took the lead in formulating a frugality plan. The factory's eleven employees changed from eating noodles once a day to once every five days, saving 1,210 yuan. They used to spend 450 yuan a day buying vegetables, but by eating wild vegetables, they could save 1,660 yuan a day. The savings would be distributed as bonuses to the factory workers, benefiting both the public and private sectors. Following this, Xinji, Hexingtai, Tongfeng Cargo Depot, and five other businesses also formulated frugality plans, saving more than 20,000 yuan every five days, enough to buy more than 200 catties of millet. After the women's association director of the business community, Tang Xiaoquan, led discussions on frugality and famine preparedness, everyone went to the fields to pick wild vegetables. Thirteen women, including Li Guinv and Liu Yurong, picked more than 300 catties of vegetables in three days. (Zhisheng)

　　吃便饭掺野菜
  　索堡商人节约
    【本报涉县讯】索堡镇商联会自提出抗旱备荒后，商人在民校讨论，二十家饭店提出要发扬四二、四三年的渡荒经验，不光管自己赚钱，还得照顾群众，停止卖油条提倡吃便饭，福利、德荣昌两家饭馆提出今后不卖肉、不炒菜减少群众浪费。商号兴隆烟厂首先订出节约计划，全厂十一人每天一顿面，改为五天一顿，可省洋一千二百一十元，每天买菜化洋四百五十元，改吃野菜每天就可省洋一千六百六十元，省洋由厂方工人分红，这样可以公私两利。接着信记、和兴太、同丰货栈等五家都订了节约计划，五天可省洋二万余元，可买小米二百多斤。商号妇会主任汤小泉领导妇女讨论了节约备荒后，都到地采野菜，李闺女、刘裕荣等十三个妇女，三天采菜三百余斤。（志胜）
