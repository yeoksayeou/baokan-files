International Briefs

　　★Seoul (United Press) - The Soviet-American Joint Commission on Korea held a formal meeting in Seoul on the 25th and began consultations with 423 representatives of Korean democratic parties and social organizations on the issue of organizing a provisional democratic government.

　　★Shanghai - The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East closed here on the 25th and has drafted its work plan. The Commission decided to take several steps, one of which is to set up an implementation team responsible for analyzing the short-term needs of various countries. The second is to determine what contributions countries can make to their own reconstruction and future economic development. The third is to study various methods for training administrative and technical advisors to assist in the implementation of the Commission's future plans.

　　★TASS reports: The Council of Foreign Ministers for Austria, held in Vienna, has been meeting for more than a month. Due to the US representative's efforts to obstruct the meeting, the meeting was caught in procedural disputes from the start. It was not until June 18 that the Soviet Union's proposal, which had been put forward as early as May 14, was adopted, stipulating that the committee must immediately review important provisions of the Austrian peace treaty concerning German assets in Austria and UN assets in Austria.

　　★Rome - The municipal election held on June 15 in Terracina, a major industrial center near Naples in southern Italy, demonstrated the overwhelming victory of the "People's Alliance." The alliance's candidates won 120,811 votes, while the Christian Democratic Party's candidates received only 2,399 votes, the royalists 2,202 votes, the Liberals 1,285 votes, and the Saragat party 1,036 votes.
