　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu, 26th—At 3:00 AM on the 18th, four American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes flew over Zhangqiu Chengbu, circling and bombing and strafing for an hour. One animal transporting stone to repair the dyke was killed, one cart was destroyed, and eight houses were collapsed. The poisonous plan to breach the dyke and cause flooding is becoming increasingly exposed.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 25th—Since the 11th, American-made Chiang Kai-shek planes have bombed river dykes in Huimin and Putai for four consecutive nights, destroying our dyke restoration project. South from Guiren Town in Huimin (south of Caohe Town) to Daoxu Ferry in Putai, many villages along the river have been damaged by the bombing.
