    Southern Shanxi Masses Celebrate Liberation; Thousands of Carts Rush Grain Day and Night for the Counter-Offensive
    [This article was] transmitted by Taiyue Branch of this newspaper on the 14th. After liberation, the masses of Southern Shanxi enthusiastically deliver grain for the counter-offensive. The people of Southern Shanxi, under the oppression of Chiang and Yan's "compiled villages," could no longer bear it. This liberation has shown the masses the difference between the Communist Party and Chiang and Yan's troops as being like heaven and hell. They believe that paying public grain to the democratic government is less than the amount lost in "compiled village" weighings, and this is for the great counter-offensive. From the wheat harvest to the present, along the Fen River on the Xinjiang-Hejin highway from Xinjiang to Hejin, thousands of large and small carts have been rushing day and night to deliver grain for the counter-offensive. Jishan County alone has 1,157 large carts, dozens of handcarts, and 285 camels, which transported 7,314 piculs of counter-offensive grain in twenty days. In the Shangliancheng area of the Fourth District, in order to ensure that the delivery of counter-offensive grain and autumn planting do not interfere with each other, the masses organized mules and donkeys into transportation teams, and cattle into plowing teams, advancing simultaneously. The Hejin grain transport team is the longest, with each farmer happily driving his livestock forward. They said, "The Eighth Route Army has saved the common people, and its kindness is as high and thick as the sky. We will use this little bit of grain to express our gratitude." Qu Fuyuan, a fourteen-year-old child from Zaotou Village in Wanquan, also followed his father to transport grain for the counter-offensive, and he fiercely scolded Yan Xishan, saying, "If it were your old Yan's troops, I wouldn't give you a single grain even if I died." Chai Keli's ox in Ronghe city walked slowly, and he anxiously beat it, saying, "If you don't walk faster, you won't be able to repay the kindness of the Eighth Route Army." This fully demonstrates the people's love for the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army.

    晋南群众欣庆解放
    大车小车数千辆
    日夜赶送反攻粮
    【本报太岳十四日电】晋南群众解放后，踊跃交纳反攻粮。晋南群众在蒋阎之“编村”百般压榨下，已无法负担下去，此次解放后，群众比之共产党与蒋阎军，有如天堂地狱之别。认为向民主政府交纳公粮还不及“编村”脱秤的多，这还是大反攻的粮食。麦收后至目前，从新绛至河津沿汾河的新（绛）河（津）公路上，数千辆大车与小车，日夜不息的赶送反攻粮。稷山县即有一千一百五十七辆大车，数十辆人推车及二百八十五头骆驼，二十天即运送七千三百一十四石反攻粮。四区上廉城群众为使送反攻粮与种秋两不误，将骡驴都组成运输队，牛为耕种队，齐头并进。河津运粮队最长，每个农民都愉快的赶着牲口前进，他们说：“八路军救活了老百姓，恩情如天高地厚，我们就拿这点粮食来表示心意吧”。万泉糟头村十四岁的儿童曲富元，亦跟随他父亲往来运送反攻粮，他并且狠狠的骂着阎锡山说：“要是你老阎的军队，死也不送一粒。”荣河城内柴科礼的牛走不快，他急的打着说：“你不快走，八路军的恩情就不能报。”充分显示了人民对共产党八路军的热爱。
