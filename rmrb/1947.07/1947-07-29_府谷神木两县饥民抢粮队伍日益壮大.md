Xinhua News Agency, Jin Sui, 27th. The grain seizure movement by famine-stricken people in the Jiang-controlled areas of Fugu and Shenmu counties in northern Shaanxi is expanding daily. In Fugu, it began in early June in Halasai, Gushanbao and other places adjacent to Suiyuan. In mid-June, it developed to Linggui, Liancheng, Huawu, Songcui and other townships and has now reached the entire county. The grain-seizing masses have formed fixed organizations, divided into eleven routes, each with dozens to hundreds of people, traversing various townships. Wherever they go, famine-stricken people join in, with the ranks reaching more than three thousand people. Many elderly men, elderly women, and children seize food and meals along the way to fill their hunger. The Jiang government has arrested many people, but cannot stop it. In Shenmu, more than 10,000 poor people participated in the rice grabbing riots that occurred in late June. The Jiang's Yulin Commissioner's Office ordered the county to collect 4,900 large stones of military grain in early May, which caused the price of grain to skyrocket. On May 20th and June 4th, there were riots of robbing grain and petitioning for exemption from military grain and corvée. Sun Shaoshan, Jiang's Yulin Commissioner, was panicked and went to suppress it three times. In late June, the price of millet exceeded 100,000 per dou. The people were furious. More than a thousand merchants and residents in the city and more than ten thousand farmers in the countryside jointly petitioned Sun. Sun said, "If you don't hand over the grain, won't the government and the army be disbanded?" The mass representatives replied, "No matter what, we have nothing to eat!" Then he took out coarse chaff and said, "Look, what are we eating?" Sun cunningly said, "We don't have any grain either!" The masses roared, "If you don't have grain, one of your mills stores dozens of dan!" Seeing that the situation was not good, Sun hurried away. The masses rushed into the mill. Although under the armed suppression of Jiang's military camp commander Zhu Honggao, they still seized grain.

Furthermore: In May and June, poor people in various parts of western Suiyuan rose up to seize rice. Sarachi, a formerly wealthy county located on the north bank of the Yellow River and on the PingSui Railway, also experienced rice-grabbing disturbances on June 4th and 6th.

Xinhua News Agency, Shandong, 27th. The Jiang government has recently set up so-called "cooperatives" in various Jiang-occupied areas of Shandong to purchase military grain at low prices, and forced unequal exchanges with a large number of American goods. The amount of grain funds airlifted from Nanjing to Qu County reached 20 billion Jiang coins. It is stipulated that the "official price" for buying wheat is 700 to 900 yuan per catty, while the urban price is around 1,300 yuan. Farmers are forced to sell wheat at a loss of 400 to 600 yuan per catty.

　　府谷神木两县饥民抢粮队伍日益壮大
    【新华社晋绥二十七日电】陕北蒋区府谷神木两县饥民抢粮运动日益扩大。府谷于六月初在毗连绥远之哈拉塞、孤山堡等地开始，六月中旬发展到灵贵、连成、花武、松翠等乡，现已及全县。抢粮群众形成固定组织，共分十一路，每路数十数百不等，遍历各乡镇。所到之处，饥民纷纷参加，行列达三千余人。不少老翁，老妇及小孩，沿途夺取粮食饭菜充饥，蒋记政府曾逮捕多人，不能制止。神木于六月下旬发生之抢米骚动，参加贫民达万余人。蒋记榆林专员公署于五月初下令该县征军粮四千九百大石，引起粮价暴涨，五月二十及六月四日曾发生抢粮和请免军粮与苛杂的骚动，蒋记榆林专员孙绍山恐慌万状，三次亲往抑制。六月下旬小米每斗突破十万大关，人民怒不可遏，城内商民千余及乡下农民万余，联合向孙请愿，孙称：“你们不交粮，不是要政府和军队解散吗？”群众代表答道：“不管怎样，我们没有吃的！”随即掏出粗糠说：“你看，我们吃的什么？”孙狡狯地说：“我们也没粮呀！”群众怒吼：“没有粮，你们一个碾房就存着几十石！”孙见情形不好，赶快溜走，群众遂冲入碾房，虽在蒋军营长朱红高的武装镇压下，仍抢夺粮食。
    又讯：绥西各地贫民五、六两月纷起抢米，位于黄河北岸及平绥铁路上的向称富庶县份的萨拉齐亦于六月四、六两日连续发生抢米风潮。
    【新华社山东二十七日电】蒋政府近在山东蒋占区各地遍设所谓“合作社”贱价勒购军粮，并以大量美货强迫不等价交换，其由南京空运衢县之粮款达蒋币二百亿。规定买麦“官价”每斤七百至九百元，而城市价则在一千三左右，农民被迫卖麦一斤，即被劫掠四百至六百元。
