　　[Xinhua News Agency, Jicha Re Liao Front, 3rd] The Rehe People's Liberation Army recovered Chaoyang, an important town on the Jin (zhou)-Cheng (de) line, on the 30th of last month. The Chiang army defending the city fled in disarray. Chaoyang is the eastern gateway to Rehe, and is known as one of the three major cities of Rehe Province, along with Chifeng and Chengde. After the Chiang army occupied the city on January 5th last year, it devoted all its efforts to managing it as an important stronghold for attacking the Rehe Liberated Area. After the city was recovered, the Chiang army's control in eastern Rehe was on the verge of collapse.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Northeast Front, 3rd] After the Northeast Democratic Allied Army annihilated more than 16,000 enemies in Siping, severely hitting the Chiang-Du army's so-called "key defense," the enemy, in order to save the situation, drew its entire mobilizable force of nine divisions from Changchun and north of Shenyang. Starting on the 22nd of last month, they launched a full-scale attack in multiple groups from the north and south along Changchun and Shenyang, and advanced side by side with the cooperation of aircraft and tanks, attempting to engage in a decisive battle with the main force of the Democratic Allied Army in the Siping area. The main force of the Democratic Allied Army had already annihilated most of the enemy defending Siping and transferred to the enemy's flanks to wait for an opportunity to annihilate the enemy. A small number of troops left in the suburbs of Siping to mop up the remaining enemies also took the initiative to withdraw on the evening of the 30th of last month while attracting the enemy to the outskirts of Siping. The Democratic Allied Army first struck on the 27th on the side of Changshanpu (north of Changtu), destroying three enemy tanks and inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Then, in Touyingzi, Yunhuajie, Nanchengzi and other places northeast of Kaiyuan, the entire 40th Division of the enemy's New Sixth Army was defeated in one fell swoop, and prisoners are being counted.

　　热河我克朝阳
  　四平前线击溃蒋军一师
    【新华社冀察热辽前线三日电】热河人民解放军于上月三十日收复锦（州）承（德）线上重镇朝阳。守城蒋军狼狈逃窜。朝阳为热东门户，与赤峰、承德并称为热省三大城市。去年一月五日蒋军侵占该城后，即全力经营，作为进攻热河解放区的重要据点。该城收复后，蒋军在热东控制力量已濒于瓦解。
    【新华社东北前线三日电】东北民主联军，在四平歼敌一万六千余，予蒋杜军之所谓“重点防御”以严重打击后，敌为挽救败局，乃由长春及沈阳以北，抽调其全部可能调动之兵力共九个师，于上月二十二日起自长春、沈阳南北两路分多股倾巢出动，并以飞机、坦克配合，齐头并进，企图在四平地区与民主联军主力决战，民主联军主力早于歼灭四平守敌大部之后，转移至敌顽军侧背，待机歼敌，留置于四平城郊肃清残敌之少数部队，亦于吸引敌军至四平外围之际，于上月三十日晚主动撤出。民主联军首于二十七日在常山堡（在昌图以北）之侧击中，毁敌坦克三辆，并予敌军重大杀伤。复在开原东北头营子、运花街、南城子等地一举将敌新六军四十师全部击溃，俘获正清查中。（附图片）
