　　Yanggu's 30,000 Farmers
  　Complete Huang He Dike Ahead of Schedule
    [Xinhua News Agency Jinji Lu Yu 6th dispatch] Since construction began on the 15th of last month, more than 30,000 liberated farmers in Yanggu County, Ji-Lu-Yu, braving the frantic strafing by Chiang planes and the shelling from Chiang's army across the river, have completed 350,000 cubic meters of earthwork, 14 days ahead of the original plan. The county magistrate personally led the staff of various sections and bureaus of the county government and the district chiefs of various districts to participate in the rush repair.
    [Xinhua News Agency Shandong 6th dispatch] With the great flooding of the Yellow River approaching, the masses along the river in the Bohai area, after completing the wheat harvest and summer planting, are increasing the repair of dangerous works and dikes under the leadership of the democratic government. In Pu-tai County alone, four districts have now concentrated 6,000 laborers, who are increasing the repair of the 12-li-long dike between Da-yu-zhang and Zheng-liu-shou.
