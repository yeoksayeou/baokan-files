    Huolu Masses Protect Grain
    Militia Bravely Fight Chiang's Troops and Puppets
    [This newspaper's report] For half a month, Huolu has launched a mass grain protection struggle,打击 striking at Chiang's troops and puppets who seize grain. Militia in various places are actively carrying out activities, harassing the enemy near enemy strongholds day and night. The masses are asking for more guns to arm themselves more powerfully. On June 24th, more than a hundred die-hard troops stationed in Nantongye went to Shangwuzhuang area in our Second District to seize wheat and grab laborers. They were severely beaten by our militia. The enemy did not seize a single grain of food, but were beaten to death, with six killed and two wounded. They ran back to Nantongye with their tails between their legs. On June 26th, the enemy's Tenth Column in Huolu City, along with a part of the Bingjing Homecoming Corps, totaling more than 500 people, went to Shangwuzhuang at 5 o'clock in the morning to seize grain and also attempted to capture our militia. Our militia discovered this in advance and bravely met the enemy before they reached the village. After covering the safe transfer of the masses, they buried landmines. When the enemy came, the landmines exploded, killing one enemy platoon leader and wounding one soldier. The enemy's spirits were dampened, and they carried the dead bodies back to the city. Our militia protected the interests of the masses and were supported by all the villagers. (Jixi Minbao)
    [This newspaper's Taiyue dispatch, 14th] After the Zhao City wheat harvest was completed, a full-scale campaign to hide grain was launched. After the liberation of Zhaocheng County in Hongdong, some cadres and the masses developed a serious sense of complacency, saying, "This is the first time in more than a decade that we have had a year of stable wheat harvest. We don't need to bury the grain we harvest." So they dug out the urns that used to hide grain, and the sentry posts were relaxed. Some cadres even wanted to go home to visit. At an enlarged meeting of county and district cadres on June 6th, under the leadership's inspiration to "dig into thoughts and hurt," each cadre made a profound self-criticism, recognizing that protecting grain is a strategic task. It is not enough to just harvest the grain and bring it home. It must be hidden so that the enemy cannot seize a single grain. An urgent mobilization was called for to carry out dispersed hiding, deep hiding, far hiding, and quick hiding. Cadres in each district set up meritorious service plans. The meritorious service plan for the First District is: (1) Make the enemy bleed if they enter the district or village, (2) Each cadre will make a landmine and hand in a mine casing, (3) Not allow the enemy to seize a single grain in the core area, transfer the grain out of the marginal area, (4) Under no circumstances should cadres leave their posts, leading the militia to fight, (5) Strive to complete Xiatun as soon as possible.

    获鹿群众保护粮食
    民兵奋勇痛打蒋伪
    【本报讯】半月来获鹿开展了群众性的护麦斗争，打击抢粮蒋伪。各地民兵积极活动，连夜到敌据点附近袭扰敌人，群众要求更多的枪支，把自己武装的更强大起来。六月二十四日驻南铜冶顽军百余人到我二区上五庄一带抢麦抓夫，遭我民兵一场痛打，敌人一粒粮食没抢走，反被打死六名，打伤两名，夹着尾巴跑回南铜冶。六月二十六日获鹿城敌十纵队，配合并陉还乡团一部共五百余人，于早晨五点钟到我上五庄抢粮，还企图捕捉我民兵，事前被我民兵发觉，不等敌人到村就勇敢的迎击敌人，掩护群众安全转移后，埋设好地雷，等敌人来时，地雷开了花，炸死敌排长一名，炸伤士兵一名，敌人败了兴，抬着死尸回城去了，我民兵保卫了群众利益，受到了全村老少的拥护。（冀西民报）
    【本报太岳十四日电】赵城麦子收完后，展开全面突击藏粮。该县在洪洞解放后，部分干部和群众产生了严重的太平观念，说：“这是十几年来头一次，安安稳稳收一年麦子吧，收回来也不用埋了，于是把过去藏粮的瓮子也刨出来，岗哨也松了，还有些干部想回家看看。六月六日县区干部扩大会议上，在领导上“挖思想往痛处挖”的启发下，每个干部都作了深刻检讨，认识了保护粮食是一个战略任务，收回家里并不能算万事大吉，必须藏起来，不能让敌人抢走一颗，并号召紧急动员起来进行分藏深藏远藏快藏，各区干部都订立了立功计划。一区的立功计划是：（一）敌人进区进村要他流血，（二）一个干部制成一个地雷交一个雷壳子，（三）腹心区不让敌人抢走一颗粮，边沿区把粮食转移出来，（四）在任何情况下干部不离开工作岗位，带领民兵打仗，（五）争取夏屯早日完成。
