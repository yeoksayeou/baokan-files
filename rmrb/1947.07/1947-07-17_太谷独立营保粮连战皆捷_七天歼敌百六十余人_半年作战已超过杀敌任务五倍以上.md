[Reported by this newspaper] The Taigu Independent Battalion has been victorious in every grain protection battle, repeatedly achieving extraordinary feats. After the "Zhuge Liang Meeting" was held on June 18, during which cadres, heroes, and activists researched concrete methods for earning merit in grain protection, they took the initiative to attack and fiercely wage struggle against the enemy, putting forward the slogan "Smash the grain-grabbing pig snouts, starve the Yan stubborn troops!" In the seven days from the 19th to the 25th, they achieved five victories in five battles, making a flying start in earning merit. On the 19th, over 300 of Yan's puppet main force from the Ninth Column invaded our Baiyan, Wangcun, and Xiaobaidi, attempting to seize grain. Our Second Company, upon hearing the news, went into action, causing the enemy of over 300 to flee in disarray. At dawn on the 20th, Yan's puppet troops from Shangzhuang again raided Wangcun and Baiyan, but were met with a head-on blow by our Second Company, with nine enemy dead and wounded before they fled back to their lairs. On the 21st, our First Company ambushed Shangzhuang and was surrounded by a battalion of over 300 men from Yan's puppet Ninth Column. Under the slogan of "To eat white flour, defend the wheat! Starve Yan Xishan!" all the brave soldiers of the First Company bravely charged and fought in hand-to-hand combat four times, repelling the stubborn enemy. The ringleaders of traitors and counter-settlement, Chen Yuying and Wang Siwa, were killed and wounded, along with 32 stubborn soldiers, and one was captured. Two machine guns, seven rifles, and over 500 rounds of ammunition were seized. On the 24th, we launched a full-scale attack on the enemy in Guoli, Yangyi. The enemy in Yangyi detected us first and dared not move. We captured the traitor and counter-settlement element Zhang Zhankui from Sigua Village alive and sent him to the local government for legal action. On the 25th, Yan's puppet Ninth Column, Sixth Battalion, and over 200 plainclothes troops from Yangyi invaded our Limeizhuang and Sigua Village. They were met with a heroic charge, suffering casualties and scattering back to Yangyi. We captured the counter-settlement ringleader Zhang Shengong alive and executed him on the spot. The counter-settlement ringleader Niu Wanfa was wounded, two rifles were seized, three were captured alive, and 13 were killed or wounded. We suffered only three minor injuries. On June 28th, there were two more victories in one day. An ambush was set on the camp soldiers at the Yangyi stronghold. After five minutes of fierce bayonet fighting, most of the enemy Ninth Column, Third Regiment, Ninth Company, who had come out to grab grain, was annihilated, with 12 killed or wounded and 27 captured alive. One machine gun, three small cannons, twelve rifles, and approximately 2,000 rounds of ammunition were seized, with no casualties on our side. On the same day, at 4 a.m., we ambushed Baiyan and Wangcun. The enemy Ninth Column, One Battalion, with over 150 men, who came to grab wheat, immediately turned and fled upon discovering our ambush. After a half-hour of fierce pursuit, over 30 enemies including a company commander were killed or wounded, four were captured alive, and twelve rifles were seized. We suffered only five injuries. On the 30th, we ambushed the Wanghuizhuang Xincun line. On that day, Yan's puppet Ninth Column, Second Regiment, Second Company, and the reconnaissance First Company, with over 70 men, went to Xinzhuang and robbed the common people of one cow and three donkeys, and took away seven young people. Passing through Xincun, they believed it was their area, and randomly ate a meal there. Our camp soldiers immediately surrounded the village in three routes. After a half-hour of village fighting, half of the enemy was annihilated, including the reconnaissance captain and 13 others captured alive, 17 killed or wounded, one machine gun, one small cannon, and fourteen rifles seized. The people who had been taken away and the livestock that had been robbed were all recovered, with no casualties on our side. In the above battles, we also protected the harvesting of over 1,300 mu of wheat.

Furthermore: The Taigu Independent Battalion has annihilated 452 enemies in half a year, seizing 18 light machine guns, 12 small cannons, 162 long and short guns, and over 10,000 rounds of ammunition, exceeding the enemy kill task by more than five times. (Tuo Shi, Shao Qiang)
