Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, July 12th: According to a delayed Associated Press dispatch from Dihua on the 8th, negotiations between the Chiang Kai-shek government and various ethnic groups in Xinjiang demanding autonomy broke down on the 7th. The reason for the breakdown was Chiang Kai-shek's refusal to allow the people of Xinjiang to exercise ethnic autonomy, and his forceful appointment on May 20th of Mesut, a Tajik, an Ining landlord, and a member of the Kuomintang Central Committee, as Chairman of Xinjiang Province. The people of Xinjiang refused to recognize this "provincial chairman" appointed by the Chiang government during the negotiations. According to the Associated Press: After the breakdown of negotiations, Mesut issued a statement on behalf of the Chiang government, demanding that the "rebellious people" (the people of Xinjiang) "open up" the Ili region to the Chinese (the traitorous, dictatorial, civil war-mongering Chiang Kai-shek government). Note: The Kazakh and other "Chantou" ethnic groups in Xinjiang were forced to revolt in 1944, resisting the bloody warlord rule of the Kuomintang's Han chauvinism and demanding autonomous rights. After more than a year of fighting and defeating the Chiang army, the Chiang government sent Zhang Zhizhong to Dihua in September 1945 to conduct "peace" negotiations with the insurgent ethnic groups. A preliminary agreement was reached with difficulty in early January 1946, but Chiang Kai-shek consistently refused to recognize several major issues, mainly the issue of local autonomy. The agreement was shelved by Chiang Kai-shek, and heavy troops were stationed in northern and southern Xinjiang to oppress and extort the people of Xinjiang, plotting to attack the insurgent people's armed forces. On February 19th and 25th of this year, people of all ethnic groups in Dihua, Xinjiang, held demonstrations twice, surrounding the provincial government to petition, protesting against the Chiang government's Han chauvinistic tyranny and demanding a reduction in the number of Kuomintang troops stationed there.

    新疆谈判破裂
    蒋介石拒绝民族自治要求
    人民不承认麦斯武德主新
    【新华社陕北十二日电】据迟到的美联社八日迪化消息，蒋介石政府与新疆要求自治的各民族方面之间的谈判，已于七日宣告破裂。破裂的原因为蒋介石拒绝新疆人民实行民族自治的要求，而于本年五月二十日强委塔吉克人伊宁地主、国民党中委麦斯武德为新疆省主席，新疆人民在谈判中拒绝承认此一蒋政府委派的“省主席”。据美联社消息：谈判破裂后，蒋政府方面由麦斯武德发表声明，要求“叛民”（新疆人民）对中国人（卖国独裁内战的蒋介石政府）“开放”伊犁区。按：新疆哈萨克等“缠回”民族，系于一九四四年被迫举义，反抗国民党大汉族主义的血腥军阀统治，要求自治权利，经年余奋战挫败蒋军之后，蒋政府方于一九四五年九月间派张治中赴迪化与起义民族进行“和平”谈判，中间难于一九四六年一月初获得初步协议，但若干重大问题，主要是地方自治问题，蒋介石始终拒绝承认。协议遭蒋搁置，并在北疆及南疆驻屯重兵，欺压与勒索新疆人民，阴谋进攻起义人民武装，今年二月十九及二十五日，迪化新疆各民族曾两度举行示威，包围省政府请愿，抗议蒋政府大汉族主义的暴政，要求减少国民党驻军。
