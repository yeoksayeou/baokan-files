　　Seventeenth Division Intensively Trains Troops and Actively Prepares for a Major Counteroffensive
    [Our Dispatch] The Seventeenth Division of the Thirty-eighth Army of the Northwest Democratic Allied Army is currently assembled in a certain area of northern Henan, intensively training troops, sharpening their swords, and actively preparing for a major counteroffensive! On one occasion, Military Commander Kong addressed the unit, calling out, "We must intensify our training and prepare for a major counteroffensive!" He demanded that "cadres must learn tactics well and apply Chairman Mao's tactical thinking to practice! Soldiers must master the four major skills." "Combine wisdom, courage, and skill to defeat the enemy!" He also pointed out that the army must achieve: "strong men, strong horses, and high skills," "fully prepare for a major counteroffensive, and make great contributions for the people!" "Unified aiming and firing, hitting the target every time without fail." "Teaching good skills is loving soldiers! Learning good skills is the only way to win battles!" Recently, cadres of each regiment have been gathering together to study tactics, combining the experience and lessons of the northern Henan campaign. Political work, logistics, and hygiene cadres are also participating in this upsurge of learning tactics. Soldiers have generally made plans. The plan of fighter Li Jinghan, a machine gunner in a certain regiment, reads: "Aim within two millimeters of a triangle, hitting four-fifths of the target. I am determined to train to be a first-class shooter." Challenges and competitions have been launched enthusiastically between squads, platoons, and companies. The Second Squad of the Fourth Company of a certain regiment proposed: "Guarantee no illness during training, each person throws grenades at least 32 meters, and must throw accurately." Soldier Yao Hua proposed that training should be "three quicks": quick to get up, quick to assemble, and quick to eat. He said: "Without hard training, skills cannot be mastered. Without good skills, we cannot win battles." The First Company even proposed "three oppositions": opposing covering up for each other out of fear of embarrassment when criticized by others, opposing the idea of being afraid of being disliked by others when challenging, and opposing the bad habit of pushing comrades into the pit by not criticizing shortcomings when seeing them. After the training upsurge was launched, the comrades' skills have been rapidly improving. Chen Liqing, a machine gunner of the Fourth Company, disassembled a turntable machine gun into eleven parts and reassembled it in three and a half minutes while blindfolded. The newly liberated soldier Wang Zengfa felt very uncomfortable when he saw his comrades disassemble the gun so quickly while blindfolded, but he couldn't even disassemble it with his eyes open. He said at the squad meeting that night: "I am determined to train hard when others are resting, and become a skilled machine gunner within a week." That night, he began to train hard. Yang Shifu, a soldier of the Third Machine Gun Company of a certain regiment, suffered from headaches and couldn't eat all day, but he practiced aiming hard during his lunch break, progressing from eight millimeters yesterday to two and a half millimeters today. In terms of political study, in addition to studying the "May 1st" editorial and "Authoritative CCP Personage's Commentary on the Current Situation," "Zhuge Liang Meetings" were also held to study how to lead new soldiers and how to consolidate the troops.

　　十七师紧张练兵积极准备大反攻
    【本报讯】西北民主联军三十八军第十七师，现集结豫北某地，紧张练兵磨刀，积极准备大反攻！某一次，孔军长对该部讲话号召：“我们要加紧练兵，准备大反攻！”他要求“干部要学好战术，把毛主席的战术思想运用到实际中去！战士要练好四大技术。”“把智慧、勇敢、技术结合起来战胜敌人！”他并指出该军一定要作到：“人强、马壮、技术高”，“全力准备大反攻，为人民立大功！”“引枪击发一元化，百发百中不落空。”“教好技术，才是爱兵！学好技术，才能打胜仗！”近日来各团干部都集中起来，结合豫北战役经验教训，研究战术。政工、后勤、卫生干部亦参加入这一学习战术的热潮。战士们普遍的订了计划，某团机枪连战士李经翰的计划上写道：“三角瞄准两米厘以内把靶五分之四命中，决心练成一个一等射手。”班排连间更热烈的展开了挑战竞赛。某团四连二班提出：“保证在练兵中不生病，每人投弹最少到三十二公尺，并且要投准。”战士姚华提出练兵要“三快”：起床要快、集合要快、吃饭要快。他说：“不苦练，技术就练不好，技术不好，就不能打胜仗。”一连更提出：“三反对”：反对被别人批评了怕难看而互相掩饰，反对挑了战怕别人讨厌的思想、反对见了缺点不批评的推同志下水坑的坏作风。练兵热潮掀起后，同志们的技术在飞快的进步着。四连机枪射手陈立清蒙住眼三分半钟把转盘机枪拆卸成十一件又装好。新解放战士王增发，那天看同志们蒙眼拆枪那么快，他却睁着眼卸不了，心里感到非常难受，晚上开班务会时他说：“我决心在别人休息时苦练，一星期内要练成一个熟练的机枪射手。”当晚他就开始苦练起来了。某团机三连战士杨世福害头痛病一天吃不下饭，却在午睡时苦练瞄准，昨天是八米厘，今天就进步到两米厘半了。政治学习方面，除学习“五一”社论，和“中共权威人士评目前时局”外，更召开“诸葛亮会”研究怎样带领新战士、怎样巩固部队。
