　　Self-Study Experience of Cadres in Qidong District
    Zhu Zeguang
    When Comrade Liu Zhian first arrived in Linxian County's Qidong District as a branch secretary, thirteen out of the seventeen cadres in the entire district were illiterate. Under the leadership of Comrade Liu Zhian, and through everyone's year of arduous self-study, six of the thirteen illiterates learned to take notes, write letters, and write reports, and were able to understand the Xinhua Daily. Two people could read the newspaper but could not write notes, and generally, everyone completed the plan of learning one new character every two days, and were able to write passes and read letters. The following is an introduction to their self-study process:
    When Comrade Liu Zhian first came, he felt great difficulties in his work because the cadres were illiterate. Considering the long-term, he was determined to improve the cultural level of the cadres. To ensure that everyone's learning is successful, the leadership must treat it as a task to be done. First, everyone was asked to discuss why they should study. Everyone realized that in the old society, people studied to get promoted, get rich, and oppress the common people; now, studying is to improve themselves and do more for the common people, which boosted everyone's enthusiasm for learning. At this time, everyone asked the leadership for help and supervision. The leadership immediately agreed to everyone's request and asked everyone to make a study plan. Everyone had great enthusiasm, and each person made a self-study plan according to their own situation. After everyone made suggestions and approved the plan, it was handed over to the leadership for safekeeping, so that it could be checked according to the plan in the future, which further promoted everyone's determination to persist in learning. The leadership should often write letters to the cadres to supervise them, patiently help them correct miswritten characters and revise drafts. Every time they came back to a meeting, they should conduct specific inspections, commend active members with learning achievements, and present their notes to the cadres for announcement, and explain that it is very helpful for the work, which not only encouraged the enthusiasm of the learning comrades, but also improved the confidence of the comrades who did not dare to learn. In addition, it is very important to study hard yourself, the influencing role is great. As long as a learning atmosphere is created, a few people who do not like to study will also be involved.
    What should they learn? The main content of the current study of district cadres is to improve culture, and the basis of learning culture is to learn to recognize characters. Everyone has a new word notebook. When they encounter a character they don't recognize or can't write, they must resolutely learn it from comrades who know many characters, and then record it in the new word notebook. It is necessary to learn the characters urgently needed in the work, such as some commonly used characters for writing letters, writing passes, and writing reports. In this way, what is learned is used, and the process of use is also learning, which is easiest to remember and everyone is also interested in. To a certain extent, it is necessary to mobilize comrades to write letters to each other. At the beginning, the writing is very simple, and only three or five sentences can be written, but as the learning of new characters increases, the sentences will increase. If you want to say something in the letter but can't write it, you will learn those few characters. The recipient of the letter is responsible for correcting the miswritten characters of the letter writer, and return the original letter after correcting it. After learning to issue passes and write letters, they learn to write reports. Although it is very simple at the beginning, the leadership should also help correct miswritten characters and put forward opinions on the writing style at any time. The district published an irregular newsletter, which on the one hand guides the work, and on the other hand is a learning garden for district and village cadres. District and village cadres are mobilized to write articles. The letters and reports they send can be modified and published in the newspaper. The manuscripts they send generally have many miswritten characters and are written in a very cumbersome manner. After being revised and published, the original manuscript is returned to them, and they are asked to learn by comparison. Everyone is very enthusiastic.
    Who should they learn from? Learn from the masses, from village cadres, from primary school teachers, district cadres can also learn from each other, and learn from everyone who is more educated than themselves. In the past, district cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds looked down on primary school teachers, but now they think that they are very capable, so they take the initiative to approach them, ask them to teach them new characters, and ask them to help revise manuscripts and write reports. Primary school teachers are also happy, thinking that district cadres look up to themselves, so they wholeheartedly help district cadres learn and enthusiastically participate in village work. District cadres also help them mobilize students, and the relationship between the two parties is very good. In larger villages, there are almost one or two intellectuals in the countryside, and finance and grain cadres also know some characters, and district cadres also learn from them. In this way, village cadres said: "The district cadres are not afraid of losing face, and learn from others everywhere. Let's hurry up and learn!" So they also brought up the enthusiasm of the village cadres. At this time, district cadres, village cadres, primary school teachers and intellectuals in the countryside formed a learning group. Some villages established a learning committee, and everyone learned together and helped each other. Everyone collectively compiled quick clapper rhymes and folk songs. You and I put together a few sentences, and after compiling them, everyone sang them and taught them to the masses. Comrades who do not know characters learn the new characters on them. It is completely self-compiled, self-sung, self-taught, and self-learned, which is a new creation of cadres learning culture.

　　淇东区干自学经验
    朱泽光
    刘治安同志才到林县淇东区当分书时，全区十七个干部，就有十三个是文盲。在刘治安同志领导下，经大家一年来的坚苦自学，十三个文盲，六个学会了记笔记、写信、写汇报等，并能看懂新华日报，两个人能读报不能写笔记，一般的都完成了两天学一个生字的计划，都能写路条看信了。现将他们自学过程介绍如下：
    刘治安同志才来时，因为干部不识字，在工作上感到很大的困难，他从长期打算，就下定决心要提高干部的文化水平。要想把大家的学习搞好，领导上就得当成一个工作来做。首先叫大家讨论为什么要学习，大家认识了：旧社会的人求学是为了升官发财压迫老百姓；现在学习是为了提高自己多给老百姓办事情，鼓起了大家的学习情绪。这时大家就要求领导上帮助和检查，领导上即刻答应了大家的要求，并让大家订出学习计划，大家劲头很大，每人都根据自己的情况订出了自学计划，再经大家提意见订出通过，交领导上保存起来，以便将来按计划来检查，这就更促进了大家坚持学习的决心。领导上要经常给干部去信督促，要很耐心的帮助他们改错字改稿子，每次回来开会时，都要做具体的检查，表扬学习有成绩的积极分子，把他们的笔记拿出来在干部中宣布，并说明对工作帮助很大，这既鼓励爱学习同志的情绪，又提高了不敢学习同志的信心。另外就是自己要抓紧学习，影响作用很大，只要造成学习空气，少数不爱学习的人也就卷了进来。
    学习些什么呢？区干部当前学习的主要内容就是提高文化，学习文化的基础首先是学认字。每个人都有一个生字本子，遇见不认识的字或写不出来的字，碰见识字多的同志就要坚决学会，然后记在生字本子上。要学习工作上迫切需要的字，如写信、写路条、写汇报常用的一些字，这样学了就用，用的过程也是学，最容易记住，大家也感兴趣。到一定程度时，要发动同志们互相写信，才开始写得很简单，只能写三五句话，但随着生字的学习，话就多起来了，信上想说什么话写不出来，就学那几个字，收信人要负责给写信的人改错字，改好后将原信退回去。学会开路条写信后，就学写汇报，才开始虽极简单，但领导上也要帮助改错字，并随时提出写法上的意见。区上办了一个不定期的小报，一方面指导工作，一方面又是区村干部的学习园地，发动区村干部写稿，他们来的信和汇报都可加以修改登报，他们来的稿子一般错字很多，写得也很累赘，修改发表后，将原稿退回去，要他们对照学习，大家劲头很大。
    向谁学习呢？向群众、向村干部、向小学教员学习，区干部又可互相学习，向所有比自己文化程度高的人学习。过去工农出身的区干部看不起小学教员，现在以为人家很有本事，就主动的去接近他们，向他们学生字，叫他们帮助改稿子写汇报。小学教员也高兴了，以为区干部看起自己来了，就尽心帮助区干部学习，热心参加村上工作，区干部也帮助他们动员学生，双方关系搞得很好。大些的村庄、村中差不多都有一两个在乡知识分子，财粮干部也都识些字，区干也向他们学习，这样一来，村干部说：“人家区干部还不怕丢人，到处向别人学习，咱们也赶快学习吧！”于是把村干部的劲头也带起来了。这时区干部、村干部、小学教员和在乡知识分子就形成了一个学习集团，有的村庄成立了学习委员会，大家在一块学习，互相帮助，大家集体编快板、编小调，你一句我两句的就凑成了，编好后就大家唱，大家去教群众，不识字的同志就学习上面的生字，完全是自编、自唱、自教、自学，这是干部学习文化的新创造。
