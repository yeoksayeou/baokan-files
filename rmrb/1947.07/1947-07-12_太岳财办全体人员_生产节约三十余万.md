    Production Savings of Over 300,000

    [Our Taiyue Dispatch, 10th] Since the Taiyue Finance Office comrades began production and frugality in March, by the end of June, within 90 days, they have produced and saved more than 320,000 yuan. Production projects include spinning, transportation, coal carrying, pig raising, chicken feeding, medicine making, shoe making, and embroidery, among which spinning and transportation have yielded the greatest profits. Eleven people participated in spinning, spinning 37.3 jin of cotton, earning over 31,000 yuan. Coal carrying earned over 20,000 yuan. Moreover, many heroes and models have emerged, such as Logistics Chief Dong Huchen, who is already 55 years old but still carried coal 53 times. The spinning model comrade Mu Fa spun 9.13 jin, and the thread reeling hero Wu Changming reeled 60 jin of thread. Significant achievements have also been made in frugality, with savings totaling over 200,000 yuan. Currently, all comrades in the Finance Office, from individuals to the organization, have set out meritorious service plans. Production model Mu Fa plans to produce and save 20,000 yuan in the second half of the year, completely handing it over to the public. Comrade Xu Jun also announced that he would save everything except grain and hand it over to the public.
    [Our Gaoyi Dispatch] County government agencies have successively formulated agency and individual savings plans in order to conserve resources, prepare for famine, and support the great counter-offensive. Generally, they save two to three liang of millet from what they should receive. In addition to achieving complete self-sufficiency in vegetable consumption for the organization, the County Armed Forces Committee sold 137 jin of pumpkins and 5 jin of green beans by the end of June. The county government has achieved self-sufficiency in vegetable consumption, and starting in July, cadres' subsidies will be largely saved and handed over to the public. Currently, all agencies are clearing up organizational finances. The County Armed Forces Committee took the lead on June 30th in handing over all 1,903 jin of millet and thousands of jin of coal left over from the past (accumulated from running training classes) to the public.
