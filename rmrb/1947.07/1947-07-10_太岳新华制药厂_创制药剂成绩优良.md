　　Taiyue Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory
  　Achieves Excellent Results in Creating Medicines

    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, 8th] The Taiyue Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory is currently supplying the liberated areas' healthcare development and the self-defense war with remarkable achievements. From March to mid-June this year, it has delivered medicines worth 15 million yuan, approximately 4,000 pounds, to the front lines. The factory was established two years ago and has a total of only thirty-two workers. Most of the instruments and tools were made by themselves, such as the main dry sterilizer steam boiler and various air pipes. Among the raw materials for medicine production, reduced iron was researched and successfully produced after more than a year of painstaking effort. They use the iron scraps left over from blacksmithing, smelt them at high temperatures, and then inject airflow to create iron oxide powder. This valuable raw material can now be obtained very cheaply. Currently, the factory can manufacture 200 kinds of well-known medicines, including more than twenty kinds of injectable solutions such as camphor water, stydi, quinine, calcium chloride, and glucose. More than twenty kinds of tinctures such as bitter tincture and Zhiyuan tincture. More than thirty kinds of pills such as Huier Sheng, black tonic pills, and constipation relief pills. More than fifty kinds of powders such as Tolle's powder and stomachic powder. More than thirty kinds of tablets such as quinine tablets and platycodon tablets, and more than ten kinds of other ointments such as red happiness ointment. Currently, the factory's products are sufficient for the general needs of the liberated areas, and only need to purchase more than thirty kinds from outside to be completely self-sufficient. Two-thirds of the raw materials for medicine production are collected from local mountains and fields, and most of the other one-third are also domestic products, with only a small portion being imported goods. More significantly, the factory has discovered and successfully manufactured more than twenty kinds of high-quality medicines from local plants and minerals, such as ephedra powder, Huier Sheng, and Bupleurum liquid, all of which have been proven to be highly effective through experiments. Their hard work and careful production have earned them enthusiastic praise and good reviews from the Taiyue military and civilians.

  　创制药剂成绩优良
    【本报太岳八日电】太岳新华制药工厂，现正以惊人的成果供应解放区的卫生建设，供应自卫战争。从今年三月到六月中旬，已有价值一千五百万元，约四千余磅的药品送上前线。该厂创立二年，全部只有三十二个工人，所有仪器和工具，绝大部分是自己制造的，如主要的干蒸器蒸气锅，和各类气管等。在制药原料中的还原铁是他们曾用过一年多的心血脑汁才最后研究成功。他们把铁匠打铁时落下的铁皮用高温炼后再注入气流即成氧化铁粉。此种贵重原料至此便可很便宜得到。目前该厂可以制造出二百种名药来，其中如注射液中之樟脑水，史迪年、奎宁、盐化钙、葡萄糖等二十余种。汀剂中之苦味汀、志远汀等廿余种。丸剂中之回尔生，黑色补丸，便秘灵等三十余种。散剂中之托氏散，健胃散等五十种。片剂中之奎宁片，桔梗片等三十余种，及其他膏剂中之红色幸福膏等十余种。现在该厂制品已够解放区一般需用，只需向外购买三十余种，即可全部自给。药品制造原料三分之二是采自本地山野中，其他三分之一也大部是国内土产，只有小部分是舶来品。更有意义的是该厂在本地植物和矿石中发现而且制造成功二十多种品质优良的药品，其中如麻黄粉、回尔生、柴胡液等都是经过试验效力卓著。他们勤劳工作与精心制作的这种良好结果，已得到太岳军民的热诚赞誉与好评。
