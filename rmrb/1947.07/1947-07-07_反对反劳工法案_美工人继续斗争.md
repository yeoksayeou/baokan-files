　　Against Anti-Labor Bill
  　American Workers Continue Struggle
    Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 4th. The massive struggle of American labor against the Taft-Hartley anti-labor bill continues. According to Agence France-Presse on the 1st, in the Pittsburgh area alone, 50,000 miners are already on strike, and it is expected that several thousand more will join them in the coming week. Due to the coal shortage, Carnegie-Illinois, one of America's largest steel companies, has already cut production at its plants near Pittsburgh by 45 percent, and the steel shortage has led to reduced working hours, shutdowns, and a surge in unemployment in other industries. It is reported that unemployment in the metal industry in the Pittsburgh area has increased to 8,000, and unemployment in the automobile industry has reached 37,000. At the same time, the conservative American Federation of Labor has hired at least 100 lawyers to sue the Supreme Court, alleging that the bill violates the U.S. Constitution. According to the leader of the legal team, the clause in the bill prohibiting union leaders from being communists violates the Constitution, because it is an inherent right of American citizens to join the political party of their choice.

　　反对反劳工法案
  　美工人继续斗争
    【新华社陕北四日电】美国劳工反对塔虎脱——哈特莱反劳工法案的巨大斗争，仍在继续中。据法新闻社一日电，仅在匹兹堡一区，罢工之矿工已达五万人，在今后一星期中，预料尚有数千人将随之罢工。由于煤的缺乏，美国最主要的炼钢公司之一卡尼基·伊里诺斯，已将其匹兹堡附近各厂的产量削减百分之四十五，而钢的缺乏又引起了其他工业的减工、停工和失业人数的激增。据称，匹兹堡区五金工业中之失业人数已增至八千，汽车工业中失业者已增至三万七千。同时，保守之美国劳工联合会已至少聘请了百名律师，准备向最高法院控告该法案之违反美国宪法。据该律师团领袖称，法案中禁止职工会领袖成为共产党员一条，即系违犯宪法。因为任何人参加他所选择的政党，乃美国公民的天赋人权。
