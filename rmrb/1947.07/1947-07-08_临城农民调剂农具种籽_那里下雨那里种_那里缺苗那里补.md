　　[Report from this newspaper] In Lincheng County, half of the villages experienced rainfall on the 21st and 22nd of last month, with some areas receiving as much as four fingers' depth of rain. Villages that received rain have organized all their strength to seize the opportunity for emergency planting under the slogan "Plant wherever it rains, plant wherever rain falls." In the Xizhen area of the first district, 98 livestock and 340 male laborers, along with some women, participated in the rush planting. Seven groups helped each other with seed drills, and the Zhang Xia Hun group, with only five laborers, planted 22 mu in half a day. Wu, the district chief of the first district, and two other comrades helped pull seed drills. When seeds and farm implements were lacking, they adjusted more than one stone of corn from Liu Village and three seed drills from Meng Village. In Dongzhong Yangquan, after the rain stopped, cadres led the entire village in groups to ensure that everyone was involved. If there were not enough livestock, they allocated them based on labor force and organized people to pull plows. In Dongzhen, under the personal guidance of Li Min and Zhang Yuxiang from the Commissioner's Office, all 30 livestock and five seed drills were put into action. In Heicheng of the second district, 60 percent of the labor force participated in the rush planting, and the Liu Lianyin group also replanted areas that were previously lacking seedlings. In the third district, Shanshang and Wei Jiahui all carried out mutual aid rush planting. In Wangjiazhuang and other villages in the fourth district, under the slogan "Plant as much as you can, plant every point you can," they are rushing to plant. In Donggou Village of the fifth district, on the Dragon Boat Festival in May, the entire village did not bother to celebrate the festival and rushed to plant. Due to the lack of livestock, labor hero Zhao Fen Chou pulled the seed drill bare-chested and planted 11.5 mu in half a day. Haozhuang organized four shock planting teams, led by labor hero village chiefs and other cadres in groups, to carry out the rush planting. The division hospital and the fifth district joint cooperative stationed in Haozhuang, in order to get the land planted as soon as possible, allocated eight livestock and some manpower to help with the planting. Under the leadership of labor hero Song Changfu in Shijialan, mutual aid groups adjusted farm tools and animal power, and the whole village mobilized to rush plant. According to incomplete statistics, in the three days of the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th of last month, 60,780 mu were rush-planted. (Lincheng Production Small Newspaper)
