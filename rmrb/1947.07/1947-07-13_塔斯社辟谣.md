Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 10th: TASS, Moscow, 9th: A few days ago, the Chinese newspaper Xinmin Wanbao, regarding a conversation with General Xiong Shihui, director of the Chiang Kai-shek's Northeast Headquarters, spread the rumor that "a Soviet army unit occupied Tacheng (i.e., Chuguchak) in Xinjiang Province within Chinese territory." TASS is authorized to announce that the above news is completely groundless and is merely the usual fabrication of the Chinese reactionaries.
Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 11th: Central News Agency, Dihua, 10th: Soviet Consul General in Xinjiang, Savelyev, has been recalled and will leave Dihua for Moscow in the coming days.

    塔斯社辟谣
    【新华社陕北十日电】塔斯社莫斯科九日电：数日前中国报纸新民晚报曾就蒋记东北行营主任熊式辉将军之谈话。散布谣言谓：“苏军某部占领中国境内新疆省之塔城（即楚古查克）。”塔斯社奉命宣布上述消息毫无根据，全系中国反动派习以为常的捏造而已。
    【新华社陕北十一日电】蒋记中央社迪化十日电：苏联驻新疆总领事萨维列夫奉召回国，日内即将离迪飞莫斯科。
