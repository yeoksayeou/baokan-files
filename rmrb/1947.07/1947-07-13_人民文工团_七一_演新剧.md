The People's Art Troupe of the Border Region, together with the Peking University Art Troupe, performed new plays at the Central Bureau resident village club on "July 1st" to celebrate the 26th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party. These plays included "The Red Army Returns," "Turning the Mind," "Putting Down the Burden," "Planting Cotton," and "Flower Drum." "The Red Army Returns" depicts how the families of Red Army soldiers and the people in the Eyuwan Soviet Area were brutally oppressed and ravaged by the Chiang Kai-shek clique after the Red Army went north to resist Japan. It shows how some utterly inhuman revolutionary traitors shamelessly and disgracefully betrayed the revolution, persecuted the families of Red Army soldiers and the people in the Soviet area, and how the families of Red Army soldiers and the people displayed high revolutionary integrity to fight against the traitors and secretly taught their children to sing songs from the Red Army era, educating them to hate the reactionaries and traitors and to learn from their fathers and brothers; and how they yearned for the Red Army, the Communist Party, and Chairman Mao, eagerly anticipating the return of the Red Army. Finally, on "July 1st" of 1945, while the people of the Soviet area secretly commemorated the Party's birthday by worshiping Chairman Mao, General Wang Zhen's southward troops liberated the old Soviet area, eliminating the traitors and collaborators. The families of the Red Army soldiers and the people in the Soviet area, separated for ten years, were able to see the light of day again. The play ends with the People's Liberation Army continuing to advance southward, liberating larger areas and liberating all the people of the country. This play, created by Comrade Wang Liaoying who came here after breaking through from the Central Plains, reflects the reality vividly and is very well performed. Many veteran cadres were moved to tears after watching it. It is a profound education for the entire audience, especially today, on the 26th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party, during the victorious counter-offensive in the entire liberated area. The performance of this play at a time when Generals Liu and Deng's ever-victorious army has marched south and crossed the Yellow River has immense practical significance. Following the "July 1st" performance, it was performed again on "July 7th" in the resident village to comfort cadres and staff members of nearby organs and the masses. The troupe has now decided to transfer more than 20 comrades, divided into three groups to go to the countryside, one group to participate in land reform in the newly liberated areas, one group to engage in production in the old liberated areas, and one group may go to the front lines. They are expected to depart in about three or four days, and it is anticipated that a large number of works will soon appear.

    人民文工团“七一”演新剧
    边区人民文艺工作团，“七一”在中央局驻村俱乐部与北大文工团联合演出新编剧：“红军回来了”、“扭转脑筋”、“放下包袱”、“种棉花”、“花鼓”等剧，以庆祝中国共产党二十六周年。“红军回来了”是写红军北上抗日后，鄂豫皖苏区的红军家属及人民如何惨遭蒋党压迫、摧残，一些毫无人味的革命叛徒，如何下流，无耻地出卖革命，迫害革命的红军家属及苏区人民，以及红军家属和人民，如何发挥高度的革命气节向卖国贼、叛徒作斗争，暗暗地教着他们的子弟唱红军时代的歌曲，教育他们仇恨反动派和叛徒，学习他们的父兄；和遥念红军、共产党、毛主席，急切地期待着红军回去。终于在四五年“七一”，在苏区人民供奉着毛主席暗暗地纪念党的生日的时候，王震将军的南下部队，解放了老苏区，消灭了汉奸、卖国贼、叛徒。一别十年的红军家属和苏区人民，又得重见天日。戏的结尾是人民解放军继续向南推进，解放更大的地区，解放全国的人民。此剧是由中原突围来此的王燎荧同志创作的反映真实、生动，演的也很好，很多老干部看了，都感动得流泪。对于全场观众是一个很深刻的教育，特别在今天，在中国共产党的二十六周年，在全解放区胜利大反攻。刘、邓将军的常胜军，已南下渡过黄河的时候，演出此剧，更有其莫大的现实意义。继“七一”演出后，“七七”又在驻村演出，慰劳附近机关的干杂人员及群众。现该团已决定抽调二十余同志，分三批下乡，一批到新解放区参加土地改革，一批到老解放区搞生产，一批可能到前方。大致三、四日后即可启程，预料不久当有大批作品出现。
