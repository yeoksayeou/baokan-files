　　The Old Woman is Absolutely Right!
　　Chairman Mao's Conclusion
　　During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the following incident occurred in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Joint Defense Army:

　　Once, a unit was marching in winter and arrived at a village in ×× Mountain. A regimental commander personally requisitioned housing. At night, all the villagers bolted their doors. The regimental commander stood in front of one house, knocked several times, but the homeowner was slow to answer because she was getting dressed. The old woman had just opened the door and saw an officer, accompanied by guards, so naturally she was a little happy.

　　But the officer, seeing that the old woman was too slow to open the door, immediately said, "Why didn't you open the door when I knocked? Quickly clear out the house!"

　　This old woman understood Chairman Mao's army, and she was naturally dissatisfied with the regimental commander's words.

　　"Oh! Is that how you officials talk?"

　　"Hey! What? Don't waste my time. We've been walking all day. Hurry up and clear out the house!"

　　The old woman said sternly to the regimental commander:

　　"Ah! The more you act like this, the more I won't clear it out for you. I've never seen the Eighth Route Army like this..."

　　So the regimental commander argued with the old woman, and the old woman made the regimental commander freeze for two hours before letting him into the house.

　　The regimental commander felt wronged and reported it to the district and county, and then all the way to the Joint Defense Political Department, requesting it to be dealt with. When people heard about this, of course there were various arguments. Some said, "The old woman is wrong. No matter what, you can't let the regimental commander freeze! The attitude might be an issue, but that's another matter."

　　Later, this matter was reported to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao solemnly concluded: "The people are not wrong at all! The old woman's actions are absolutely right, because she knows that the Eighth Route Army is their army, so she strictly teaches us. If it were a warlord's army, she wouldn't dare to teach them. This is a good sign of the people's political awareness. What's wrong with that?..."

　　After Chairman Mao made his conclusion, the regimental commander was severely criticized. He reflected on his bad thoughts: "In the past, I always thought I was a regimental commander and the people should take care of my face. This is wrong. This is wanting to stand above the people, forgetting that even though I hold the position of regimental commander, I am also a son of the people! Isn't thinking like this committing the habits of the Kuomintang army?"

### 老太太对得很！　毛主席的结论

　　老太太对得很！
  　毛主席的结论
    抗战期间，陕甘宁联防军里发生了这样一件事情：
    有一次部队冬天行军，到达××山村里，一个团长亲自号房子。黑夜，老百姓全都上了门，这位团长站在一家门口，敲几下，但房东因为穿衣，出来迟了。老太太刚开门，见是一位官长，还跟着警卫员呢，自然心里有些高兴。
    但官长见老太太出来太迟了，开口便说：“为啥敲门不开？快给腾房子！”
    这位老太太是懂得毛主席的军队的，他自然不满意团长的说话。
    “哟！你这当官的就这样说话吗？”
    “咳！什么，你别废话，我们走了一天了，快去腾房子！”
    老太太口吻严厉的向着团长：
    “啊！越这样，那我就是不给你腾，我没见过八路这样…………………”
    于是团长跟老太太争吵起来，那个老太太就让这个团长冻了两个钟头，才让他进了屋。
    这位团长觉得受了委曲，就反映到区、县，一直反映到联防政治部去请求处理。人们听到这事后当然论点种种，有的说：“老太太不对，无论如何也不能叫团长挨冻啊！态度上有些不讲求是另一回事。”
    后来这事情反映到毛主席那里去了。毛主席严正的下了结论：“老百姓没有一点不对！老太太这做法对得很，因为他知道八路军是他们的军队，才严格的教训我们，如果要是军阀部队，他就不敢去教训，这是老百姓政治上提高的好现象，有什么不对呢？……………”
    毛主席作了结论，这个团长受到了严格批评，他反省了自己的不良思想：“我过去总以为我是团长，老百姓应该关照我的面子，这是不对的，这是想站在老百姓头上，忘记自己虽担任团长，也是人民的子弟呀！这样相法不是犯了国民党军队的习气了吗？”
