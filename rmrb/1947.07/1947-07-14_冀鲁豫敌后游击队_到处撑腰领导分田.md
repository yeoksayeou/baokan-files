Hebei-Shandong-Henan Enemy-Back Area Guerrilla Force
Everywhere Supporting and Leading Land Redistribution
[Reported by our newspaper from Hebei-Shandong-Henan, 13th] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Enemy-Back Area Guerrilla Force combines guerrilla warfare with land reform, and the masses are emancipated wherever they are stationed. The Wen Shang Brigade, operating in the second and third districts south of the city, opened up the situation in twelve villages in just eight days. On the first day the brigade entered the second district, it mobilized the masses in Li Yin Village to investigate land and property, and opened up the situation in just one day. They dealt with four landlords, seized six cattle, more than 3,000 catties of grain, and a lot of clothes, bedding, and utensils. They also recovered old contracts and established new ones. Seven hundred people enthusiastically participated in the movement with extremely high morale. On the second, third, and fourth days, they cooperated with comrades from the district to deal with seven more villages. Shang Village and Shi Village were particularly enthusiastic. The two landlords in Shang Village were thoroughly investigated. The men moved firewood and dug for grain, while the women looked for clothes, pots, and pans. All the property changed hands within a day. When the brigade entered the third district, the cadres were in low spirits and the militia were exhausted. The brigade immediately helped them conduct self-criticism, making everyone realize why the work had not been successful in the past: it was because land reform had not been carried out. Therefore, the brigade cooperated with all the cadres in the district to mobilize the masses to investigate land and property, greatly raising the thinking of the cadres in the third district. In the eight days that the brigade spent in the second and third districts, it opened up the situation in twelve villages, investigated more than thirty landlords, and the masses received more than 30,000 catties of grain, thirty head of livestock, and thousands of pieces of clothing and bedding. The Yunbei Brigade, in an active and tense guerrilla environment, helped the land reform in the stationed villages. Due to the enemy's frantic "mopping-up" operations and the restoration of the landlords, the fruits that the peasants had previously divided were mostly forcibly taken back, so the masses were particularly poor when the spring famine was not yet over. After the troops proposed "one hand holding a gun, one hand dividing the land," they convened a meeting of cadres above the platoon level, assigned work team members, and went to understand the situation of landlords reversing grain and land in the stationed villages. Then, they held mass meetings and landlord meetings, ordering the landlords to return the grain and firewood. On the first day, they recovered 3,000 catties of grain and firewood each. Now it is being expanded from the stationed village to nearby villages. In one week, four villages and forty-five basic masses have received 2,200 catties of wheat, 1,800 catties of red grain, and 6,070 catties of firewood, including two battles in which fifteen enemies were killed or wounded. After the Feng (County) Yu (Tai) Brigade inserted into the central area, it replenished the mass movement work team. Whenever it arrived in a village, it would investigate landlords with heinous crimes, arrest them immediately, and hand them over to the masses for disposal. Many comrades were so busy understanding the materials that they stopped taking naps and extracurricular activities. Everyone's morale was extremely high. From the work in the stationed villages, the relationship between the army and the people was consolidated, and the troops were even more consolidated. The Yuncheng Brigade achieved specific division of labor. The battalion headquarters and three companies were divided into three work teams, with organizations such as guard troops, arrest teams, propaganda and transportation teams, and guard registration and distribution teams. Each team put forward a meritorious service competition, and the morale was extremely high. Two villages have been worked on, and the work is continuing. The Political Department of the Seventh Military Subdistrict held an activist training class in the enemy-back environment, training 1,500 people as movement backbones. It also held landlord-middle peasant training classes to explain the government's policies and laws separately, paying special attention to uniting with middle peasants and mobilizing them to participate in the struggle. A "Concentric Conference" of more than 4,000 masses from seventeen villages was held, expressing firm support to the masses at the meeting, telling the poor to compare themselves with the landlords, and everyone rising up to investigate. After the meeting, the villages beat drums and gongs, actively moving things, looking for grain, and exchanging houses, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. Comrade Luo Zhong, the head of the Mass Movement Section, led the propaganda team to participate in the land reform work in the West Sub-district of the Second District of Dongping, and was warmly welcomed by the local masses. Comrade Luo Zhong was also elected as a people's hero, and the propaganda team was also elected as a model unit.
