　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: London Dispatch: The Transport and General Workers' Union, Britain's largest union from which Bevin rose to prominence, discovered thirty proposals expressing dissatisfaction with Bevin's foreign policy at its regular meeting in Hastings on the 15th. Irish Belfast representative Solomons sternly criticized Bevin's foreign policy, saying: The government should not yield to Wall Street. Many of the 700 delegates present at the meeting (representing 1.3 million members) demanded the withdrawal of troops stationed in Greece and a ban on working for Franco's Spain. London representative Winston urged Britain to withdraw its troops stationed abroad to solve domestic labor problems during the debate.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 18th: London Dispatch: Labor Party Member of Parliament Zilliacus recently stated in an interview with a London-based reporter from the American "Allied Labor News": The current policy line of Britain and France is to extend the Truman Doctrine from Greece and Spain to Western Europe, rather than develop a European construction plan. Regarding British foreign policy, Zilliacus believes it is facing a dilemma: the better its relations with Eastern Europe, which can supply it with food and raw materials, the fewer opportunities it has to obtain financial aid from the United States. But at the same time, Zilliacus also predicted that within six or eight months (note: from this year to next year, British officials estimate that the $3.75 billion borrowed from the United States last July will be used up by then), Britain will urgently need to develop good economic relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.

　　英国最大工会例会斥责贝文向美屈服
    【新华社陕北十八日电】伦敦讯：贝文赖以起家的英国最大工会——运输及各业工人工会，于十五日在哈斯丁斯召开例会时，发现了对贝文外交政策表示不满的提案达三十件。爱尔兰伯尔发斯特代表梭尔姆斯严斥贝文外交政策称：政府不应向华尔街屈服。出席该例会的七百名代表（代表一百三十万会员）中不少要求撤退驻希军队。并禁止为佛朗哥西班牙作工。伦敦代表温生于辩论中敦促英国撤回驻外军队以解决国内劳工问题。
    【新华社陕北十八日电】伦敦讯：工党议员齐里亚库斯日前于接见美国“同盟劳工新闻社”驻伦敦记者时称：英、法现在的政策路线，就是将杜鲁门主义从希、士伸展到西欧，而不是发展欧洲的建设计划。关于英国外交政策，齐氏认为它已面临进退维谷之境：它若能供给它粮食及原料的东欧关系愈好，它从美国获得金元的机会就愈少。但同时齐氏又预测称：在六个月或八个月内，（按：即今年至明年，英国官方预计去年七月向美国借的三十七亿五千万美元到那时候就要用完。）英国必将迫切需要与苏联及东欧发展良好的经济关系。
