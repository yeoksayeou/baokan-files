[Reported by our Jinnan office on the 13th] Qinghe fights against insect plagues, launching merit-making campaigns, with women and children as the main force. In ten days, they dug up four million mole crickets, saving 600 mu of seedlings every day. From June 21st to July 1st, according to incomplete statistics from 131 villages, more than 7,000 jin of mole crickets were captured. Each jin contains 600 small ones or more than 500 large ones, totaling more than 4 million. In addition, 1,629 nests of larvae were dug up (200 to 400 in each nest), and more than 1,000 ground squirrels were also caught. If we calculate based on the minimum damage to seedlings, just 4.2 million mole crickets, each damaging one seedling per day, would result in 600 mu of seedlings being eaten every day. The main reason for the rapid and widespread surge in the capture campaign is that most of the masses have stipulated merit-making conditions for catching mole crickets, indicating their determination to earn merit for everyone. The timely discovery and commendation of activists in the process played a great role in promoting the campaign. Women and children participated as the main force, with men participating in the gaps between emergency planting and weeding, or in the evenings, fully utilizing the wisdom of the peasants and spreading methods to each other.

[Reported by our Jinnan office on the 13th] Locust nymphs have appeared in Ningnan, Yaoshan, Qizhi and other places. The government is leading the masses to eliminate them on the spot, with children as the vanguard. The locust plague in Xing Village and Xidiantou Village in the first district of Yaoshan, because adult men and women were busy with emergency planting, mobilized students from the two villages to organize a nymph-beating team, personally led by Song Fenshu and Director Yi, and eliminated most of the small nymphs on 45 mu of land in one morning. In Laoyutan and other villages southeast of Su Village, the entire village, young and old, was mobilized to dig defensive ditches, preventing the locust nymphs from spreading. When small nymphs in Gangshang Village in the fourth district of Nanhe were densely populated and spreading in all directions, the teacher led the students in a surprise attack, completely eliminating them in one day. Flying locusts appeared in Xuhe, Lianhuapo and other areas in the second district of Ningnan. Students in the village captured and beat 130 jin in two days. The masses in more than ten villages surrounding Duan Village in the first district of Qizhi dug ditches to surround and trap the locusts, and carried out locust eradication.

    宁南·尧山·企之
    急起清剿蝗蝻
    清河大力捉蝼蛄
    十天杀死四百万
    【本报冀南十三日电】清河与虫灾斗争，开展立功，妇女、儿童作主力，十天挖蝼蛄四百万个，每日救苗六百亩。该县从六月二十一日至七月一日止，据一百三十一个村不完全统计，共捕捉蝼蛄七千多斤，每斤小者六百个，大者五百多个，合四百多万个。另外掘获幼虫一千六百二十九窝（每窝二百至四百个），还捉住一千多个地鼠。如以损害青苗最低数来推算，仅四百二十万个蝼蛄，每个每天损害一棵苗，每天就要有六百亩青苗被吃光。在捕捉中所以很快轰成了普遍性的浪潮，主要原因是多数群众都规定了捉蝼蛄立功条件，表示要为大家立功，在进行捕捉中，及时发现表扬积极分子，起了极大推动作用。妇女、儿童参加成为主力，男人在突击抢种、抢锄的空隙里或晚上参加，充分发挥了农民的智慧，互相传播办法。
    【本报冀南十三日电】宁南、尧山、企之等地发生蝗蝻，政府率领群众就地歼灭，儿童作了急先锋。尧山一区刑村、西店头村的蝗灾，因成年男女均忙于抢种，即动员两村学生组织了打蝻队，由宋分书，饴主任亲自率领，一个早晨即将四十五亩地之小蝻大部消灭。苏村东南之老域滩等村，动员全村老少挖下了防御沟，蝗蝻不能蔓延。南和四区岗上村小蝻密集，正向四处发展时，教员即率领学生突击一天全部捕灭。宁南二区徐河、莲花泊一带发生飞蝗，该村学生两天即捕打一百三十斤，企之一区段庄周围十余村的群众挑沟围困，进行剿蝗。
