　　Wholeheartedly Serve the Masses, Everyone Striving to Be a Meritorious Worker
  　Taiyue and Jiluyu Launch Merit Campaign
    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, 30th] Since the Taiyue Fourth District Committee issued instructions on establishing merit in late April, the merit campaign has spread from the direct organs of the district to various counties, districts, and villages in the past month. Organizations at all levels have established merit committees and merit evaluation groups. Border areas have established merit command headquarters. All have carried out ideological mobilization. The beginning of the campaign focused on commending, evaluating, and modeling; for example, when the direct bank of the district evaluated merit, it praised a comrade's experience in following the mass line when issuing loans in the sixth district of Jincheng, which promoted all work, and the work efficiency of the accounting section quickly doubled. The Special Commissioner's Office saw the model of Kang Na and Bai Yuhua, a couple who saved enough production to supply a soldier for the whole year. Accountants Li Gang and Li Zili helped each other calculate accounts, increasing work efficiency threefold. Gaoping praised even the smallest achievements in the merit campaign. When the victory of the Jinan Campaign came, the Gaoping Post Office drew pictures for publicity, and the Merit Committee immediately praised them, creating a wave of written propaganda.
    [This Dispatch from Taiyue, 30th] The masses in Shiming Fourth District held a grand meeting to celebrate the merits of 300 participating meritorious workers. They served the Jinan Front for more than two months and returned victoriously a few days ago. The district specially held a district-wide celebration meeting in Shili Village on June 2nd. An old man said: "In the past, it was the officials who became meritorious workers, but now it is the common people who become meritorious workers, what a good world." At the meeting, fourteen participating meritorious workers took the stage to report on their achievements, which sparked thunderous applause. Meritorious worker Ma Gezhuan reported that he treated the wounded soldiers like his own brothers, feeding them water and food, and helping them with bowel movements. He did not leave the wounded soldiers when the planes came. Cadre meritorious worker Li Guiwang, the village chief of Zhaigou, said that he carried stretchers and luggage for the militiamen when crossing the Fen River, which aroused applause from the audience. Then there was a gift and flag presentation, and the meeting adjourned.
    [This Dispatch from Jiluyu, 30th] The counties in the Fifth District have launched a merit campaign and achieved remarkable results. Since the Fifth District Committee proposed launching a merit campaign in April, the counties have launched a campaign of commending merits, models, and merit competition. The Cao County Committee called for establishing merit for the masses and doing a good job in land reform. All comrades in the Tenth District resolutely expressed their response to the call for establishing merit and striving to establish first-class merit. The Dingtao County Committee specially formulated specific measures for establishing merit and merit certificates. The county government held a grand merit commendation meeting on May 20th, selecting work models Liu Fazhen and others and learning models Lin Baoming and others. After the commendation meeting, more than 300 county and district cadres in the county competed to establish merit for the people. District cadre Qi × said: "Work hard and strive to wear the Medal of Meritorious Service." The Second Company of the Heze Militia used to have very low morale. Since the conference to establish merit, reward heroes and models, the morale of all comrades in the company has soared, setting off a merit competition between platoons and squads. In terms of mass discipline, no one violated the rules, and they also actively fetched water and manure for the masses, fetching more than 400 loads of water for the masses in four days, which was supported by the masses. Although surrounded by enemies on all sides, they had full confidence to persist in the struggle. Since Fucheng launched the merit campaign, the situation has greatly improved. Work has been carried out in 900 villages in the county, and the land reform has largely been launched. Now it is thoroughly re-examined and the ideological education of the masses is strengthened. Many peasant liberation meritorious workers have emerged in various villages. The leading organs of the Southwest Shandong District, from the beginning to the villages, everyone is working actively, making the situation in western Shandong greatly improved. Even in the tense enemy rear, the land reform work is in full swing, tunnels have been built, and direct struggles have been carried out against the enemy, greatly improving the guerrilla warfare.

    【本报太岳卅日电】太岳四分区自四月下旬地委会发出立功指示后，一月来立功运动已从分直机关普及各县区村，各级组织都建立了立功委员会、评功小组，边沿区建立了立功指挥部，并都作了思想动员，开始都是从表功、评功、表模着手；如分直银行在评功时，表扬了某同志在晋城六区发放贷款走群众路线的经验，推动了全部工作，会计科工作效率很快提高一倍。专署出现了康纳、柏玉华夫妇全年生产节约供给一个战士的模范。会计李刚、李自立互助算帐提高工作效率三倍。高平在立功运动中发现一点就表扬一点，晋南战役胜利时，高平邮局画图宣传，立功委员会立予表扬，一时文字宣传形成热潮。
    【本报太岳三十日电】士敏四区群众举行盛会，为三百参战功臣贺功，他们服务晋南前线两个多月，于日前胜利归来，区上特于六月二日在十里村召开全区贺功大会。一个老汉说：“从前是大官当功臣，现在是老百姓当功臣，好世道呀。”开会中十四位参战功臣登台报告功绩，一时掌声如雷，功臣马圪转报告他象自己的亲兄弟一样招呼伤员，喂水喂饭，帮助大小便，飞机来时他不离开伤员。干部功臣寨沟村长李贵旺说，他过汾河时替民兵抬担架担行李的事迹，都引起台下的掌声。接着进行献礼、献旗散会。
    【本报冀鲁豫三十日电】五分区各县展开立功运动，获得显著成绩。五地委从四月份提出开展立功运动后，各县即掀起了表功表模及立功竞赛，曹县县委号召今后要为群众立功，搞好土地改革工作。十区全体同志坚决表示响应立功号召，争取立头功。定陶县委会特制订立功具体办法及功劳证，县政府于五月二十号举行了隆重的立功表模大会，选出工作模范刘发振等四人，学习模范林保明等四人。表功大会后全县三百余县区干部均争相要为人民立功，区干齐×说：“工作挂挂劲，争取戴上功臣勋章”。荷泽民兵二连，过去情绪很低，自从开了立功奖励英模大会后，全连同志情绪高涨，掀起排与排班与班立功竞赛。在群众纪律方面，没有一个人违犯，还积极给群众打水推粪，四天就给群众打水四百多担，得到群众的拥护，虽四面临敌，但他们有了充分信心坚持斗争。复程开展立功运动以来，局面大为好转，全县已有九百村庄开辟了工作，土改大部轰开局面，现正在彻底复查和加强群众思想教育，各村出现不少农民翻身功臣。鲁西南分区领导机关起一直到各村，人人都在积极工作，使鲁西局面大有起色，虽在紧张的敌后，土改工作也搞的热火朝天，建设了地道，直接向敌人进行了斗争、把游击战争大大提高了一步。
