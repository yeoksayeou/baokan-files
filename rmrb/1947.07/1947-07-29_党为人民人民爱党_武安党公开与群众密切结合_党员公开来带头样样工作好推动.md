　　The Party is for the People, the People Love the Party
  　Wu'an Party Publicly Combines Closely with the Masses
  　Party Members Publicly Take the Lead, All Work is Promoted Well
    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] After the general merit evaluation campaign before "July 1st," the Party at all levels in Wu'an officially went public in early July. According to reports from several districts and villages to the county party committee, the merit evaluation campaign within the Party and the Party's public disclosure have greatly increased the enthusiasm of Party members and their zeal for serving the people, further strengthened the relationship between the Party and the masses, and vigorously promoted the current production and famine preparedness movement and the anti-feudal struggle being carried out in conjunction. The county and district party organs could close their doors and go to the countryside before, but now they cannot close their doors for even a day. This is because many people who want to join the Party, inquire about the detailed conditions for joining the Party, have matters requiring assistance, or have difficulties they want solutions to, come to the Party organs every day. Despite attempts to refer them to the responsible authorities for resolution, the number of people coming remains constant. When village branches and party members went public at mass meetings, the masses showed extreme joy. Some said, "I saw that ××× was qualified to be a Party member long ago." Some said, "We've found our roots! Let's follow ×××! You can't go wrong." Some masses suddenly realized, "I used to think the Communist Party was some kind of deity! Turns out, they're just good people who lead us to turn over and live a good life, now I understand!" The slogan "Follow the Communist Party" is more powerful than ever. After Guo Lixiu, a model Party member from Kou Shang Village in the Eighth District, went public, his father said, "I used to complain that Lixiu was never home, day or night, going to meetings and doing work, and I scolded him every day, but he never gave up. Today I understand that my child is a Communist, serving the people. He's honored, and I'm honored too. Even if he doesn't want to do it in the future, I will urge him to do it!" Party members in Zhao Zhuang called on the masses to step up production and become rich, and the masses said, "Chairman Mao loves us poor people; Party members are leading us in labor and production, saying that good production is a gift to the Communist Party, and this gift is for ourselves!" According to statistics from 22 Villages in the Ninth District, in response to the call of Party members, 62,000 more pumpkin kilns were planted, 6,900 mu were rushed to be planted, 6,600 jin of thread were spun, 10,000 mu were brightened, and 134,000 jin of wild vegetables were harvested within seven days in early July, greatly exceeding the production efficiency of the past. Women in Wanfu Village planned to spin 2.6 liang of thread per person in seven days, but the result was more than three liang. They spun until the rooster crowed, and went to harvest wild vegetables early in the morning. Eighty activists in Shili Store quit smoking, achieving four "lights" in seven days: manure delivered, land harrowed, weeds hoeed, and odd jobs done. Children did not eat snacks for seven days, and each household did not eat white flour for seven days. Party members with problems, encouraged by the Party's merit evaluation and selection of models, consciously resolved to overcome their mistakes. Hu Tingxuan, a Party member in Nanxi Jing Village, confessed to having preserved more than 20 pieces of clothing for a landlord, saying, "It's been eight or nine years since the revolution, and I'm still acting as a 'bomb shelter' for the landlord! I'm sorry to the masses, sorry to the Party!" Under his influence, the village launched a campaign to dig up "bomb shelters" and squeeze out feudalism during labor breaks, and many honest farmers who had been acting as "bomb shelters" confessed. At the Party member merit evaluation and comparison meeting in the Tenth District, the branch secretary of Jiexian Village was good in every way, except that he married a landlord's wife and was not elected as a model. He resolutely wanted to divorce her when he returned. Party members and the masses in Chakou Village in the Eleventh District warmly discussed the benefits of the Party's leadership over the years during a "July 1st" forum. Subsequently, someone made a self-criticism, saying, "The Party called on us to turn over, but we ourselves were not resolute, and the feudalism was not thoroughly fought!" Everyone unanimously decided to re-struggle. On July 2nd, thirteen landlords were cleared in one day, and thirteen animals, twenty dan of grain, eight houses, six hundred and thirty yuan in cash, and fifty bundles were fought out. Twenty of the bundles were reported by a military family. According to statistics from 23 Villages in the Sixth District, from July 2nd to 8th, in response to the Party's call to squeeze out feudalism, the landlords were resolutely pursued, and another 400 mu of land, 50,000 jin of grain, 1,400 pieces of clothing, thousands of houses, 2,100 yuan in cash, and 9 jin of opium were fought out. This is roughly equivalent to the gains from the seven months of struggle in winter and spring. Party members throughout the county are responding to the call of the county party committee and are now further developing a campaign for Party members to perform meritorious deeds. Every Party member enthusiastically requests the branch to regularly assign them certain tasks and regularly check and record their merits. Many villages, adapting to this new situation, have established agriculture mutual aid, sideline (commonly known as picking and chopping), war participation, textile, feudal squeezing, propaganda and commendation departments or groups, and Party members are working with the masses in a certain department to make plans and perform meritorious deeds, so that various tasks can be advanced in an orderly manner. According to the county party committee, all kinds of work are easier to promote now than ever before. (Er Dong)

　　党为人民人民爱党
  　武安党公开与群众密切结合
  　党员公开来带头样样工作好推动
    【本报特讯】武安各级党经过“七一”以前普遍的评功运动，已于七月上旬正式公开。综合若干区村向县委的汇报，党内的评功运动与党的公开，使党员的积极性与为人民服务热情大大提高，党与群众的关系更加亲密，并使目前的生产备荒运动与结合进行的挤封建斗争获得有力推动。党的县区机关以前可以关门下乡，现在是一天也关门不得。因为有许多请求入党的、追问入党详细条件的、有事要求帮助解决的、有困难要求想办法的群众，每天都跑到党机关来。尽管设法将他们介绍到各主管机关去解决，来找的人仍是不断头。各村的支部与党员在群众大会上公开时，群众显出极度的欢欣。有的说：“×××我早看人家够个党员。”有的说：“这可找着根啦！跟着×××干吧！没错。”有的群众恍然大悟说：“以前我当共产党是啥神人哩！原来就是领导咱们翻身过光景的好人，这可明白啦！”“跟共产党走”的口号比以往任何时候都有力量。八区口上村模范党员郭里修公开后，他父亲说：“以前我光嫌里修黑夜白天不在家，开会啦，工作啦，我天天骂他，可是他永不泄气，今天我才明白俺孩是共产党，为人民服务哩。他光荣，我也光荣，以后他不干我也要催他干哩！”赵庄党员号召群众加紧生产发家，群众说：“毛主席就是爱咱这受苦汉；党员们带头领导咱劳动生产，说好好生产就是给共产党送了礼，这礼也都是送给咱自己呀！”九区廿二村统计，群众响应党员号召，七月上旬七天内多种南瓜六万二千窑，抢种六千九百亩，纺线六千六百斤，亮窑一万亩，打野菜十三万四千斤，生产效率大大超过往日。宛府村妇女七天计划是每人纺二斤六两线，结果均超过三斤。每天都纺到鸡快叫，一清早又打野菜去了。十里店八十个积极分子戒绝纸烟，七天做到四光：粪送光、地耙光、草锄光、零活做光。儿童七天不吃零食，各户七天不吃白面。有毛病的党员，经过党内评功选模范的鼓舞，都自觉地决心克服自己的错误。南西井村党员胡廷宣自报出为某地主保存的二十多件衣服，说：“革命八、九年啦，还替地主当‘防空洞’哩！我对不起群众，对不起党！”该村在他影响下，乘劳动空隙展开挖“防空洞”挤封建运动，好些当“防空洞”的老实农民都自报了。十区党员评功比进步大会上；结贤村支书一切都好，就是娶了一个地主老婆，未能当选模范，回去坚决要离婚。十一区茶口村党员与群众“七一”座谈，热烈地谈了历年来党领导大家的好处。随后即有人检讨说：“党叫咱翻身哩，可是咱自己不坚决，封建没斗透！”大家一致决议重新斗争。七月二日一天清算了十三个地主，斗出十三个牲口，二十石粮食，八座房，六百三十元现洋，五十个包袱。有二十个包袱是一个军属自报出来的。六区二十三村统计，七月二日至八日，响应党的挤封建号召，坚决追击地主，又斗出土地四百亩，粮食五万斤，衣服一千四百件，房千间，现洋二千一百元，大烟九斤。约等于冬春七个月斗争所获。全县党员响应县委号召，现正进一步开展党员立功运动。每个党员都热烈要求支部经常分配给一定任务，经常检查记功，许多村适应这种新情况，都分别成立了农业互助、副业（俗称拾砍）、参战、纺织、挤封建、宣传表扬等各部或组，党员都在一定部门中与群众一块订计划、立功，使各种工作得以有条不紊的齐头并进。据县委谈：现在各种工作比以往任何时候都容易推动。（而东）
