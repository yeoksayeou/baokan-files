  　May Income Exceeds 100 Million Yuan
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The straw hat industry in Lucheng County has achieved remarkable results. In the first five months of this year, the income exceeded 100.5 million yuan, accounting for 6.8 percent of the county's total land income, playing a significant role in production and disaster preparedness. The masses in the county have a historical tradition of weaving straw hats. In 1943 and 1944, the democratic government organized the masses to produce and overcome famine, calling on them to weave straw hat braids and purchasing twelve hat-sewing machines. Over the years, the straw hat industry has developed rapidly. Currently, there are 21 hat workshops in the county, with 54 hat-sewing machines. So far, more than 16,000 dozens of hats have been produced, earning more than 25 million yuan. More than 100,000 catties of straw hat braids have been produced, amounting to more than 100 million yuan. In addition, the income from handmade hat sewing, native yarn, and workers' wages totals more than 23 million yuan. (Jin Xiang, Wen Hui, Feng Jun)
