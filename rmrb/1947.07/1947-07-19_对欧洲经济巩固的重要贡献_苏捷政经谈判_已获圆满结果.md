Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Reports from various sources: Moscow and Prague simultaneously released a joint Soviet-Czech communiqué on July 12th stating that the Czech government delegation arrived in Moscow on July 9th and, from that date, held talks with relevant parties in the Soviet government. Both sides discussed important international political issues, especially issues related to Soviet-Czech relations. The talks showed that both sides had completely consistent views and reached unanimously adopted resolutions. During the thorough discussion of the issue of economic cooperation between the two countries, both sides concluded that the economic relations between the two allies must be expanded to ensure a continuous exchange of goods between the two countries and to ensure the completion of the economic plans and full utilization of labor in both countries. In view of this purpose, the governments of the two countries will sign a five-year agreement on the mutual exchange of goods. This agreement should be based on a system of fixed exchange quantities of goods determined in advance each year by the governments of the two countries. The quantity of goods to be exchanged in 1948 should be determined before the signing of this agreement. At the same time, if possible, the approximate exchange quantities of certain goods for the five-year period should be determined.

Xinhua News Agency, Northern Shaanxi, 14th: Moscow dispatch: The Czech delegation, headed by Czech Prime Minister Gottwald, left the Soviet Union for the Czech Republic on July 12th. Molotov and others went to the airport to see them off. In a speech at the airport, Gottwald said briefly: The political and economic negotiations conducted by the Czech and Soviet delegations have been successfully concluded. This once again shows that the Soviet Union has a beneficial influence on the survival of the new Czech Republic. The result of the economic negotiations has formed a valuable contribution to our country's economic development. The new achievement of Soviet-Czech cooperation can truly be regarded as an important contribution to the consolidation of European economy and European peace.

    对欧洲经济巩固的重要贡献
    苏捷政经谈判
    已获圆满结果
    【新华社陕北十四日电】各方讯：莫斯科与布拉格于七月十二日同时发表苏捷联合公报称：捷克政府代表团于七月九日抵达莫斯科，自当日起即与苏联政府有关各方进行会谈。双方曾涉及重要之国际政治问题，尤致力于捷苏间关系之问题。会谈显示双方观点完全一致；并产生一致通过之决议。双方在彻底讨论两国经济合作之问题时获得了结论，认为两同盟间之经济关系必须扩展，以保证两国间持久不息之货物交换，并保证两国经济计划之完成与劳力之充分利用。鉴于此种目的，两国政府将签订五年物资互换协定。此一协定当建基于两国政府每年先期确定之货物固定交换数量制度之上。一九四八年交换货物之数量，应在此一协定签订之前确定。同时，如属可能，应确定若干货物至五年期间之近似交换数量。
    【新华社陕北十四日电】莫斯科讯：以捷总理哥特瓦德为首的捷代表团一行，于七月十二日离苏返捷，莫洛托夫等均亲往机场欢送。哥氏在机场发表演辞略称：捷克与苏联代表团所进行的政治经济谈判，已获圆满结果。此事又一次表示苏联对新捷克共和国的生存具有有利的影响。经济谈判的结果，对我国经济发展已形成有价值的贡献。苏捷合作的新成就，可以真正认为是对欧洲经济之巩固与欧洲和平的重要贡献。
