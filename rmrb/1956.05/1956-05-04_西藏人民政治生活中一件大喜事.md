(Summary of the speech by Panchen Erdeni on behalf of Living Buddha Öljay at the Lhasa celebration of the founding of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region)

Living Buddha Öljay said: The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is a great happy event in the political life of the broad masses of the Tibetan people and another great victory for the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao's policy on nationalities in the Tibetan region. It fully demonstrates the care and love of the Central Government and Chairman Mao for our Tibetan people. Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, under the brilliant light of Chairman Mao's policy on nationalities, Tibet's political, economic, cultural, health, transportation and other undertakings have made great achievements and developments, enabling our Tibetan people to truly enjoy the rights of national equality and freedom of religious belief, and the warmth given to us in the big family of the motherland. We believe that with the successful establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, it will surely encourage our Tibetan people and the people of the motherland to further strengthen unity, accelerate the development of the economy and culture of the Tibetan region, promote the prosperity of religion, and ensure that the happy life of the Tibetan people will come more quickly, and at the same time further promote the early realization of a unified Tibet Autonomous Region, and make greater efforts to jointly build a prosperous and happy socialist society. Finally, he wished the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region a successful completion of its tasks.

　　西藏人民政治生活中一件大喜事
    （班禅额尔德尼代表欧居活佛在拉萨市庆祝西藏自治区筹委会成立大会上的讲话摘要）
    欧居活佛说：西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，是我们西藏广大人民政治生活中的一件大喜事，是中国共产党和毛主席民族政策在西藏地区又一大胜利。它充分标志着中央和毛主席对我们西藏人民的关怀和热爱。西藏和平解放以来，在毛主席民族政策的光辉照耀下，西藏的政治、经济、文化、卫生、交通等事业都有了很大的成绩和发展，才使我们西藏人民真正享受到了民族平等和宗教信仰自由的权利，和祖国大家庭中给我们的温暖。我们相信，随着自治区筹备委员会的胜利成立，一定能够鼓舞着我们西藏民族和祖国人民进一步加强团结，加速的促进西藏地区经济、文化的向前发展，宗教的昌盛，保证西藏人民的幸福生活将会更快的到来，同时更加促进统一的西藏自治区早日实现，为共同建设繁荣幸福的社会主义社会作出更大的努力。最后他预祝自治区筹委会胜利完成任务。
