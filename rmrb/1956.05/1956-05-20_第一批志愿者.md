    The First Batch of Volunteers
    Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union, Li He
    Yesterday, radio waves carried the call of the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers throughout the Soviet Union. The Party is calling on brave, strong, and fearless young people to go to the East, the North, and the Donbass to participate in construction. The Party's voice is inspiring young people throughout the Soviet Union. Within hours of the Party's call being broadcast, the first batch of applications from young volunteers for construction had flooded the offices of the Central Committee of the Komsomol and Komsomol committees at all levels.
    Eleven young people from the "Moscow Underground Construction" Second Trust, including Tikhonov, jointly expressed in "Pravda" their desire to work at the Bratsk Hydroelectric Power Station. The letter of application stated: "We eleven young construction workers are fitters, aged seventeen to nineteen. We have a strong desire to work at this construction site, and we are not afraid of difficulties. We guarantee to the Party and the government that we will gloriously fulfill our obligations."
    Fourteen young people from the Khimochninsky district, including Polishchuk, after careful consideration, jointly applied, saying: "We fourteen people—seven boys and seven girls—have decided to form a mixed work team and work collectively. Some of us have several skills and can help each other when necessary. We are prepared to face difficulties. We will tame the Siberian rivers and develop the Siberian treasures, making them serve the Soviet people."
    The Komsomol members of the tool workshop of the "Red Proletarian" factory held a flying meeting after work yesterday. Lathe operator Svinarev said in his speech: "We Komsomol members have always been prepared to complete any of the most difficult tasks given to us by our beloved Party. I request to be sent to the eastern region. Wherever I am sent, that is where I will work." Many young volunteers at this factory made the same request yesterday and today.
    Young people in many enterprises in Leningrad also held gatherings, with great enthusiasm. On the evening of the first day, the Kirov District Committee of the Komsomol had already received dozens of applications. Lathe operator Nikonova and ironworker Kovaleva of the Neva Machine-Building Plant belong to the first batch of volunteers from Leningrad. Kovaleva said: "I am not afraid of difficulties and am prepared to work anywhere and complete any task."
    The Komsomol committee of the Kirov Lathe Manufacturing Plant in Tbilisi is very active, with many people running to ask the Komsomol secretary, Gvitadze: "How do I go to the East, and who do I apply to?" The most determined are three good friends—demobilized soldier Lelisvili, electrician Selichenko, and lathe operator Babayev. They are all Komsomol members, studying together in the eighth grade of the young workers' night school, and have now decided to go to the East together. They went to the Komsomol district committee and municipal committee again and again to inquire about the news. The number of people borrowing books about the eastern region from the factory library has increased significantly, and they are very concerned about the climate and products of the eastern region.
    Throughout the Soviet Union, in factories, institutions, schools, collective farms, state farms, and tractor stations, people are talking about this new call. A new youth patriotic movement is rising. (Nineteenth)

    第一批志愿者
    本报驻苏联记者　李何
    昨天，电波把苏共中央和苏联部长会议的号召传遍苏联各地。党在号召勇敢坚强不怕困难的青年到东部、北部和顿巴斯参加建设去。党的声音激动着全苏联的青年。在党的号召广播后不到几个小时，第一批青年志愿建设者的申请书已经拥进共青团中央和各级团委会的办公室了。
    “莫斯科地下建设”第二托拉斯的吉洪诺夫等十一名青年联名在“真理报”表示渴望到布拉次克水电站去工作。志愿书中说：“我们十一个青年建设者的职业是钳工，年龄是十七岁到十九岁。我们有强烈的愿望到这个建设工地去工作，我们不怕困难。我们向党和政府保证，我们将光荣地完成自己的义务。”
    喜木金区的波里舒克等十四名青年在郑重地考虑以后联名申请说：“我们十四个人——七个男孩子和七个女孩子，决定组成混合工作队，集体地去工作。我们当中好些人会几种技艺，必要时可以彼此帮助。我们准备迎接困难。我们将驾御西伯利亚河流，开发西伯利亚宝藏，使它们为苏联人民服务。”
    “红色无产者”工厂工具车间共青团员昨天下班后举行了飞行集会。旋工斯维纳列夫发言说：“我们共青团员们向来准备完成我们亲爱的党给予的任何最困难的任务。请求派我到东部地区。派到那里，我就到那里工作。”这个工厂在昨天和今天有许多青年志愿者提出同样的请求。
    列宁格勒许多企业的青年也举行了集会，热情十分高涨。第一天傍晚，共青团基洛夫区委会已经收到了数十份申请书。涅瓦机器制造厂的旋工尼柯诺娃和铁工柯瓦列娃属于列宁格勒的第一批志愿者。柯瓦列娃说：“我不怕困难，准备在任何地方工作，准备完成任何的任务。”
    在第比利斯的基洛夫车床制造厂的团委会里十分活跃，许多人跑来问团委书记格维塔泽：“怎样到东部去，向谁申请？”最坚决的是三位好朋友——复员军人列利斯维利、电工谢利钦科和旋工巴巴也夫，他们都是共青团员，一起在青年工人夜校八年级学习，现在决定一起到东部去。他们一次又一次到团区委会和市委会去打听消息。人们在工厂的图书馆借阅有关东部地区书籍的数量显著上升，十分关心东部地区的气候和物产。
    苏联全国工厂、机关、学校、集体农庄、国营农场、拖拉机站，人们都在谈论这个新的号召。一个新的青年爱国主义的运动在高涨着。（十九日）
