Xinhua News Agency, May 18th, Washington: Indonesian President Sukarno delivered a speech at a joint session of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives on May 17th, requesting members of the U.S. Congress to pay attention to and understand the national aspirations of Asian and African countries.

Sukarno's speech largely addressed the issue of nationalism. He said, "For many countries in the world today, nationalism may be an outdated doctrine; for us Asians and Africans, however, it is the primary driving force of our endeavors." Sukarno asked the United States to understand this point.

Accepting Foreign Aid Should Not Undermine Independence

Sukarno then spoke about the issue of U.S. foreign aid. In addressing this issue, he said he wanted to speak frankly to the members of the U.S. Congress. He said that the effects of U.S. foreign aid after the war have not all been positive. U.S. foreign aid should be conducted according to the different circumstances of each country. If these countries are not fully understood, "then, even if your motives for providing aid are purely for the stability of the region, the results will be counterproductive, and even the continuous injection of billions of dollars will only lead to strained relations."

Sukarno emphasized that military aid cannot replace stability in Asia. He said: Military aid "will only help the countries receiving military aid become more dependent on the United States. Therefore, their value as genuine partners in the common struggle for freedom, peace, and prosperity will be diminished."

Sukarno said that in his mind, the main goal "should be to enable the people of Asia to achieve economic and political stability like Western countries."

Sukarno said that Indonesia, with a population of eighty million, "will accept with the utmost gratitude any assistance that can be given to us, regardless of where it comes from. Because such assistance will alleviate our burdens and shorten our struggle."

Sukarno then stated that Indonesia would adhere to its national stance when accepting foreign aid. He said, "No material benefit can buy away any part of our hard-won freedom." He also said: "Freedom, to us, is more valuable than any product any country can give or sell us. We reject this notion of trading intellectual and spiritual independence or practical freedom for monetary benefits."

Colonial Rule in West Irian Must End

Another important part of Sukarno's speech was the issue of ending colonial rule in West Irian. He said: West Irian is a colonial stronghold on Indonesian territory. Indonesia's national struggle is not yet over. "The return of West Irian is the remaining part of our national political aspirations, the last of the colonial debt." He said that if West Irian is not returned to Indonesia, "our own freedom is still not complete. The happiness of freedom will not fully be savored by us until the whole of Indonesia is once again unified under freedom. And freedom is the birthright of all mankind."

Sukarno said that on the issue of West Irian, Indonesia has no quarrel with the Dutch people or the Dutch government. "We quarrel with colonialism, we quarrel with the Dutch government's colonial attitude and actions."

Sukarno said: Some people have told Indonesia that the people of West Irian are not yet ready for change, that they need the continued guidance of the West to train them to transition to freedom. Sukarno said, "We understand this guidance—after 350 years of rule, it left us with 94% illiteracy." And now, in Indonesia today, eleven years after independence, illiteracy has been reduced to 40%. He said: Indonesia has made more progress in the eleven years since independence than in all the decades of colonial rule. He said, "Our people have found their souls in freedom. The people of West Irian will do the same after they gain their freedom."

Oppose Atomic War, Advocate Peaceful Coexistence

Sukarno then expressed opposition to atomic war. He said he does not believe that "war is the nature of mankind," nor does he believe that mankind "cannot live in peace with its neighbors." Sukarno called for no mistakes to be made in the use of atomic weapons. He said: "We will welcome everything that helps create a safe future for our children. We will support any action taken by you or responsible leaders of any country to eliminate the shadow of the atomic bomb looming over the world."

In concluding his speech, Sukarno said, "There is no need to doubt Indonesia's democracy." He said: Indonesia is capable of fulfilling the serious responsibilities of a nation in such a "turbulent world." He also said: All in all, democracy is about giving the local people equal opportunities to engage in human activities, and secondly, giving foreign competitors a certain degree of opportunity to ensure maximum effectiveness.

A United Press report said: This joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives was one of the largest congressional meetings in recent years to hear a foreign head of state speak. Representatives from the sixty-five foreign embassies in Washington, D.C., members of the U.S. Supreme Court, and members of President Eisenhower's cabinet were all there to hear his speech. United Press said that U.S. officials praised the president's eloquence and thoughtfulness in the speech, although some parts of the speech were inconsistent with U.S. policies regarding the importance of providing military assistance to the free world and the appropriateness of accepting assistance from communist countries.

### 苏加诺在美国谈亚非国家民族愿望

    苏加诺在美国谈亚非国家民族愿望
    新华社18日讯　华盛顿消息：印度尼西亚总统苏加诺五月十七日在美国参众两院联席会议上发表演说，要求美国国会人士注意和理解亚非国家的民族愿望。
    苏加诺演讲的大部分谈的是民族主义问题。他说：“对今天世界上的许多国家说来，民族主义可能是一种过时的主义；对我们亚洲和非洲人说来，这却是我们努力的主要动力。”苏加诺要求美国了解这一点。接受外国援助不能损害独立
    苏加诺接着谈到美国对外援助的问题。在讲这一个问题的时候，他说他要向美国国会人士讲几句老实话。他说，战后美国对外援助的效果并不都是好的。美国的对外援助应当根据各国不同的情况来进行。如果不充分了解这些国家，“那末，即使你们给予援助的动机纯粹是为了这个地区的稳定，结果也会适得其反，哪怕是源源不断地注入几十亿美元，结局也只能是关系紧张。”
    苏加诺强调说：不能够用军事援助来代替亚洲的稳定。他说：军事援助“将只能够有助于使接受军事援助的国家更加依赖美国。因此，它们作为争取自由、和平和繁荣的普遍斗争的真正伙伴的价值将会减少”。
    苏加诺说：在他的心目中，主要的目的“应当是使亚洲人民像西方国家那样，在经济和政治上获得稳定”。
    苏加诺说：拥有八千万人口的印度尼西亚“将以最感激的心情接受可以给予我们的任何援助，不管援助来自何处。因为这种援助将能减轻我们的负担和缩短我们的斗争”。
    苏加诺接着表示，印度尼西亚将在接受外国援助的时候坚守它的民族立场。他说：“任何物质好处都不能买去我们的得之不易的自由的任何部分。”他还说：“自由对我们来说，要比任何国家能够给予或卖给我们的产品更为宝贵。我们拒绝用智力和精神的独立或实际的自由来换取金钱方面的好处的这种主张。”必须结束在西伊里安的殖民统治
    苏加诺演说的另一个重要部分是结束在西伊里安的殖民主义统治问题。他说：西伊里安是印度尼西亚领土上的殖民地据点。印度尼西亚的民族斗争还没有结束。“归还西伊里安是我们国家政治愿望的剩余部分，这是殖民债务的最后一笔。”他说，如果西伊里安不归还印度尼西亚，“我们自己的自由仍然不是完全的。在整个印度尼西亚再次在自由下统一以前，自由的幸福不会对我们有充分的滋味的。而自由却是全人类的生而具有的权利”。
    苏加诺说：在西伊里安问题上，印度尼西亚同荷兰人民或者荷兰政府都没有争吵。“我们是同殖民主义争吵，我们同荷兰政府的殖民态度和行动有争吵。”
    苏加诺说：有人曾经告诉印度尼西亚说：西伊里安的人民还没有准备好，不能进行改变，他们需要西方继续指导他们，训练他们过渡到自由去。苏加诺说，“我们懂得这种指导——在统治三百五十年以后，它留给我们的是94％的文盲”。而现在，在印度尼西亚独立以后的今天，文盲已经降低为40％。他说：印度尼西亚在独立后的十一年里所取得的进步大于在殖民主义统治的全部几十代里所取得的进步。他说：“我国的人民在自由中找到了他们的灵魂。在西伊里安人民获得自由之后，他们也会这样做。”反对原子战争主张和平共处
    苏加诺接着表示反对原子战争。他说他不认为“战争是人类的天性”，不认为人类“不能和邻人和平相处”。苏加诺呼吁不要在使用原子武器方面犯错误。他说：“我们将欢迎有助于为我们的儿童缔造安全的将来的一切事物。我们将支持你们或任何国家的负责领袖们采取的消除笼罩在世界上的原子弹阴影的任何行动。”
    在结束他的演讲的时候，苏加诺说：“不必怀疑印度尼西亚的民主。”他说：印度尼西亚是有能力在这样一个“动乱的世界”中履行一个国家的严重责任的。他还说：说来说去民主就是让当地人民自己有平等的机会来进行人的活动，其次是给外国竞争者一定程度的机会以保证最大的作用。
    合众社的一条消息说：这次参众两院联席会议是几年来为了听取一位外国国家元首演说而举行的规模最大的国会会议之一。驻在华盛顿的六十五个外国大使馆的代表、美国最高法院人员和艾森豪威尔总统内阁人员都去听他演说了。合众社说，美国官员们对这位总统的演说的口才和周到加以赞扬，虽然演说中有些地方同美国的关于给予自由世界以军事援助的重要性以及关于接受共产党国家的援助的适宜性的政策是相抵触的。
