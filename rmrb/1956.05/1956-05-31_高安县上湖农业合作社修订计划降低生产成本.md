    Shanghu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gao'an County, Jiangxi Province, recently revised its production plan to reduce production costs.
    This cooperative originally planned to expand double-cropping rice by 1,800 mu this year, increasing grain production by 360,000 jin, with investment accounting for 29% of the planned income from double-cropping rice. After the plan was formulated, the members voiced many opinions, some saying: This plan is one of high cost, low yield, empty pockets, and wasted effort. As a result, the members' enthusiasm for production was not high. Later, the members were mobilized to discuss the plan, reducing the production targets and shrinking the investment plan. The original plan was to buy 30 head of oxen, but after research by the members, it was decided that only 10 head were needed. For the remaining 20 head, the cooperative would concentrate its efforts before and after transplanting early rice to fatten the existing thin oxen and strengthen the strong oxen, and rationally arrange the use of oxen power, thus solving the problem. This alone reduced cash expenditure by 1,000 yuan. Other measures to reduce production costs included reducing purchases of commercial fertilizers and collecting waste materials from members to repair farm implements. Through these measures to reduce production costs, the cooperative's original planned total production expenditure of 8,370 yuan has now been reduced to 3,192 yuan. The members estimated that if they followed this plan, each labor force could generally increase their income, which greatly increased the members' enthusiasm for production.

    高安县上湖农业合作社修订计划降低生产成本
    江西省高安县上湖农业生产合作社最近修订生产计划，降低生产成本。
    这个社今年原计划扩大一千八百亩双季稻，增产粮食三十六万斤，投资占双季稻计划收入的29％。计划订出来了以后，社员意见纷纷，有的说：这个计划是本钱大、收成少、腰包空、白费工的计划。结果社员生产情绪不高。后来发动社员讨论计划，把增产指标减少，并且缩小了投资计划。原计划买三十头耕牛，经过社员研究，只要买十头就行了。还差的二十头，在栽早禾的前后，集中力量，把全社原有的瘦牛喂壮，把壮牛喂强，并合理安排牛力，问题就解决了。光是这一项就减少了一千元的现金支出。其他减少买商品肥料，从社员手中收集废材料，整修农具等，通过这些降低生产成本的措施，全社原先计划8，370元的生产总开支，现在已经减少到3，192元。社员们预算了一下，按照这个计划去做，每个劳动力一般都能增加收入，这样社员的生产劲头就更大了。
