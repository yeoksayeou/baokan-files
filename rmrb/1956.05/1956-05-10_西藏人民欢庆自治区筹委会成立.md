Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 8th. People from all over Tibet are celebrating the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. Celebration rallies have been held successively in towns such as Xigaze, Qamdo, Heihe, Gyantse, and Yatung. Mass celebration rallies have also been held in rural areas of more than a dozen Dzongs and estates along the Yarlung Tsangpo River, in the Himalayan Mountains, and on the banks of the Lancang River.

When the good news reached the Qamdo area, a propaganda team working in the countryside celebrated the joyous day with the farmers of Jiaka Village. The male and female farmers in the village sang and danced from day to late at night, offering highland barley wine to the propaganda team members to thank them for traveling a long distance to deliver the good news.

Thousands of congratulatory letters have been sent to the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Tibet Daily, some with Hada scarves attached. These congratulatory letters came from many temples in Tibet and remote rural areas. Ciren Dorje, a primary school teacher in Pali, wrote in his congratulatory letter: "We live in Pali, which is more than 4,000 meters above sea level. The cadres sent by Chairman Mao have helped to improve the culture of the Tibetan people and helped us establish a school here. We are determined to celebrate the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region with practical actions of studying hard and doing a good job of unity." The congratulatory letter from the Kanbu, officials, and all monks of the Ya’dong Do’er Temple in southern Tibet said: "The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region not only enables the people to be masters of their own affairs, but also symbolizes the bright future of Tibet."

　　西藏人民欢庆自治区筹委会成立
    新华社拉萨8日电  西藏各地人民欢庆西藏自治区筹备委员会成立。日喀则、昌都、黑河、江孜、亚东等城镇，都先后举行了庆祝集会。在雅鲁藏布江沿岸、喜马拉雅山区和澜沧江畔等十几个宗和溪卡的农村，也举行了群众性的庆祝大会。
    当喜讯传到昌都地区的时候，一支下乡工作的宣传队和佳卡村的农民一起欢度了喜日。村里的男女农民，从白天歌舞到深夜，他们向宣传队员们献青稞酒，感谢宣传队员们远道前来传送喜讯。
    千百封祝贺信寄到西藏自治区筹备委员会和西藏日报社，有的贺信还附上了哈达。这些祝贺信有的来自西藏的许多寺庙，有的来自边远的农村。帕里的一个小学教员次仁多吉在贺信里写道：“我们居住在拔海四千多公尺高的帕里。毛主席派来的干部为了帮助提高藏族人民的文化，帮助我们在这里设立了学校。我们决以努力学习和搞好团结的实际行动，庆祝西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立。”西藏南部亚东朵尔寺的堪布、职事和全体僧众的贺信说：“西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，不但使人民能够当家作主，同时还象征着西藏的光辉远景。”
