Adjusting Farm Tools
    Currently, some agricultural production cooperatives do not have enough farm tools, while others have a surplus. In order to help cooperatives lacking farm tools overcome production difficulties, the ShaXi District in Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, has organized the adjustment of farm tools. The method of adjustment is as follows: First, understand the surplus and shortage of farm tools in each cooperative in the district, and organize the cooperatives to exchange what they have and don't have, based on the principle of voluntariness. Large farm tools are generally rented, and small farm tools are bought and sold to each other through the market. This method is very popular among farmers. In two days of trading in ShaXi Town, the transaction volume of farm tools reached more than 6,600 yuan.

    调剂农具
    目前，有些农业生产合作社农具不敷使用，另一些农业生产合作社农具又有剩余。为了帮助缺少农具的合作社克服生产上的困难，江苏太仓县沙溪区组织了农具调剂工作。调剂的办法是：首先了解全区各个合作社的农具余缺情况，组织各个合作社按照自愿的原则互通有无：大型农具一般是租借，小型农具通过市场互相买卖。这个办法很受农民欢迎。沙溪镇两天的交易中，农具成交额就达到六千六百多元。
