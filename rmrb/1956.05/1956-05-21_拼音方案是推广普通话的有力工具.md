The Pinyin Scheme is a Powerful Tool for Promoting Putonghua
韦悫

    One of the main uses of the Pinyin scheme at present is to teach Putonghua. According to the State Council's instructions on promoting Putonghua, Putonghua is based on the Beijing pronunciation as the standard sound, the Northern dialect as the basic dialect, and exemplary modern vernacular works as the grammatical norm. With the development of China's politics, economy, and culture, this kind of Putonghua has gradually formed over a considerable period of time. The written language we use now is basically written using Putonghua vocabulary and grammar. However, since Chinese characters are not phonetic, the pronunciation of Putonghua cannot be expressed in the structure of Chinese characters according to the Beijing pronunciation. Although in the last forty years, the pronunciation of Putonghua has in fact gradually tended towards Beijing pronunciation as the standard sound, and although our written language is basically Putonghua, the pronunciation of most of us is still very divergent. Therefore, the central link in promoting Putonghua is to promote Beijing pronunciation.

    Promoting Putonghua cannot rely solely on oral transmission; there must be a tool for recording or marking pronunciation, as a "crutch" for learning pronunciation, so that oral transmission can be combined with reading aloud. The structure of Chinese characters cannot correctly represent pronunciation, which creates great difficulties for learning pronunciation. Although there are many phonetic-semantic characters in Chinese characters, the phonetic components of these characters are not phonetic, so people who do not know the pronunciation of these radicals cannot pronounce the sounds of these characters. Moreover, in fact, the phonetic components of many phonetic-semantic characters can no longer correctly represent the pronunciation of these characters. For example, 潼、疃、钟、憧、幢、僮 (Zhuang nationality) all have the radical 童 (tong), but the pronunciation of these seven characters is different. If you don't look up the dictionary, how many people can pronounce all of them correctly?

    Originally, we have always used the method of using homophonous Chinese characters to annotate pronunciation or using two Chinese characters to form a "fanqie" (a traditional method of indicating the pronunciation of a Chinese character by using two other characters), but both of these methods are extremely troublesome. Why? Because Beijing pronunciation, including tones, has about 1,284 sounds. If homophonous Chinese characters are used to annotate pronunciation, one must know 1,284 Chinese characters that can annotate Beijing pronunciation in order to be able to use them to annotate the pronunciation of other Chinese characters. Furthermore, taking "fanqie" as an example, in addition to knowing a considerable number of Chinese characters, one must also understand phonology. Moreover, some characters do not have homophones (such as 日, 恩, 女, 命, 徐, 揣, 俩, 夯, etc.), and some characters are also very difficult to "fanqie" (such as 日, 恩 in the above example).

    Due to the inconvenience of using Chinese characters to annotate pronunciation as mentioned above, in the past, there was the creation of Zhuyin symbols such as ㄅ, 攵, 冖, ㄈ, etc., to meet the need for annotating the pronunciation of Chinese characters. Zhuyin symbols serve to annotate the pronunciation of Chinese characters and have made certain contributions. However, the strokes of Zhuyin symbols are tortuous and inconvenient to write continuously, and some syllables spelled out are not accurate enough (for example, 宾 is spelled as ㄅㄧㄣ, which is not as accurate as using Latin letters to spell bin), and they cannot be flexibly changed. In addition, Zhuyin symbols cannot be used as symbols for science, mathematics, logic, international telecommunications, etc. In these respects, Zhuyin symbols are not as good as Latin letters. As for using them to write phonetic script, the shortcomings of Zhuyin symbols are even more significant.

    Now let's see how to use these letters to learn Putonghua. There are thirty of these letters, twenty-eight of which are used to represent Beijing phonetic units, and the other two are used to separate syllables. Through these twenty-eight letters, we can master the Beijing phonetic units and spell out all the syllables of Beijing pronunciation to teach Putonghua or annotate the pronunciation of Chinese characters. To learn Putonghua, one must first learn the pronunciation and spelling of these letters. After learning them, one can read the pronunciation of each spelled syllable, and at the same time, after listening to Beijing pronunciation, one can also spell it out using letters.

    For example, after learning the pronunciation and spelling of the five letters r, e, n, m, i, you can spell out the two syllables rénmín and use them to annotate the pronunciation of the two Chinese characters 人民; after learning the pronunciation and spelling of the six letters g, u, η, h, e, o, you can spell out the three syllables gùηhéguó and use them to annotate the pronunciation of the three Chinese characters 共和国. By analogy, we can spell out all the syllables of Putonghua and annotate the pronunciation of any Chinese character. The Chinese character annotation sample of the Chinese Pinyin Scheme (draft) below is a clear example.

    According to our experience in running alphabet training classes in Beijing, people with elementary cultural level need 12 to 16 hours to learn the letters and spelling of the Chinese Pinyin Scheme (draft); people with secondary cultural level need 6 hours to 8 hours; people with secondary or higher cultural level who already know Latin letters only need to study for two or three hours by themselves. According to the experience of various provinces and cities in running Putonghua pronunciation training classes, language teachers can master the pronunciation and spelling of letters, as well as the rules of Beijing pronunciation, after four to five weeks of intensive study, and can pass it on to others.

    Of course, learning Putonghua cannot be done in a few hours. After learning the pronunciation and spelling of the letters of the Chinese Pinyin Scheme (draft), it is necessary to further learn to read and spell the 411 or so basic syllables of Putonghua, and through the marking of tones, one can correctly pronounce according to the tones. On this basis, we can practice reading or speaking through Putonghua readers annotated with letters or spelled out with letters. After mastering the pronunciation and spelling of letters and the syllables of Putonghua, through more listening, more speaking, more reading, and more writing, we can all learn Putonghua in a certain period of time.

    In dialect areas, we can also use letters to spell out the pronunciation, make a comparison between dialect pronunciation and Beijing pronunciation, and find out the corresponding rules between dialect pronunciation and Beijing pronunciation, to accelerate the learning of Putonghua. For example, in Jiaodong in Shandong, northern Guangxi, Yunnan and other places, wherever the Beijing pronunciation is чia (ㄐㄧㄚ), it is pronounced gia (ㄍㄧㄚ) there. After mastering this corresponding rule, all the characters that are pronounced gia there, such as 家, 加, 嘉, 笳, etc., should be changed to чia. In this way, learning becomes more convenient and remembering becomes easier. Dialects (except for minority languages) are all branches of Chinese, so they have more or less corresponding rules with Beijing pronunciation. Finding out the corresponding rules between dialect pronunciation and Beijing pronunciation is of great help to people in dialect areas to learn Putonghua. From this, it can be seen that the role of Pinyin letters in promoting Putonghua is multifaceted. When we implement phonetic script, because what is spelled out is Putonghua, learning phonetic script is in fact equivalent to learning Putonghua. At that time, the promotion of Putonghua will be particularly fast, which can be asserted.

    拼音方案是推广普通话的有力工具
    韦悫
    拼音方案在目前的主要用途之一，就是用来教学普通话。依照国务院关于推广普通话的指示，普通话就是以北京语音为标准音、以北方话为基础方言、以典范的现代白话文著作为语法规范的。随着我国政治、经济、文化的发展，这种普通话已经在一个相当长的时期内逐渐形成了。现在我们用的书面语言基本上是用普通话的词汇和语法写下来的。但是由于汉字不是拼音的，普通话的语音就不可能依照北京语音在汉字的结构上表达出来。尽管在最近四十年来，普通话的语音事实上已经逐渐趋向于以北京语音为标准音。尽管我们的书面语言基本上是普通话，我们大多数人的语音还是很纷歧的。因此，推广普通话的中心环节是推广北京语音。
    推广普通话不能单靠口传耳听，必须有记录语音或者标注语音的工具，作为学习语音的“拐棍”，以便口传耳听能够跟念读结合在一起。汉字的结构不能正确地表示读音，给学习语音造成极大的困难。汉字虽然有许多形声字，但是这些字的声旁不是拼音的，因而不知道这些偏旁的读音的人们就念不出这些字的音。而且事实上许多形声字的声旁早已不能够正确地表示这些字的读音了。例如潼疃钟憧?幢僮（僮族）都是童旁，但是这七个字的读音是不同的。如果不查字典，有多少人能念得全呢？
    本来我们一向有用同音汉字来注音或者用两个汉字来反切的办法，但是这两种办法都是顶烦难的。为什么呢？因为北京语音连声调在内约有1，284个音，如果用同音汉字来注音，就要认识1，284个能标注北京语音的汉字，才可以用来标注其它汉字的读音。再拿反切来说，除了要认识相当数量的汉字外，还要懂得音韵学才行。而且有些字就没有同音字（例如日、恩、女、命、徐、揣、俩、夯等），有些字也很难反切（例如上例中的日、恩等）。
    由于上面所讲汉字不便用来注音的情况，过去才有ㄅ、攵、冖、ㄈ等等注音字母的产生，来满足给汉字注音的需要。注音字母为汉字注音服务，有一定的功劳。可是注音字母笔画曲折，不便连写，拼出来的某些音节不够准确（例如宾拼成ㄅㄧㄣ，就不如用拉丁字母拼成bin那样准确），又不能灵活变化。此外，注音字母也不能用来做科学、数学、逻辑学、国际电讯等等的符号。在这些方面，注音字母都不如拉丁字母。至于用来写拼音文字，注音字母的缺点就更显著了。
    现在让我们看看，怎样使用这些字母来学习普通话。这些字母共有三十个，其中二十八个是用来代表北京语音单位的，另有两个是用来分隔音节的。通过这二十八个字母，我们可以掌握北京语音单位，并且可以拼出北京语音所有的音节，用来教学普通话或者给汉字注音。学习普通话首先要学会这些字母的发音和拼法。学会了以后，就可以读出拼写出来的每个音节的音，同时听了北京语音，又可以用字母拼写出来。
    举例来说，学会r、e、n、m、i这五个字母的发音和拼法，就可以拼出rénmín这两个音节，并且可以用来给人民这两个汉字注音；学会g、u、η、h、e、o这六个字母的发音和拼法，就可以拼出gùηhégnó这三个音节，用来给共和国这三个汉字注音。照此类推，我们可以拼出普通话所有的音节，并且可以给任何汉字注音。下面汉语拼音方案（草案）的汉字注音样品是明显的例子。

    根据我们在北京办字母讲习班的经验，初等文化水平的人们需要12到16小时学会汉语拼音方案（草案）的字母和拼法；中等文化水平的人们需要6小时到8小时；中等以上文化水平并且已经认识拉丁字母的人们只要自修两三小时就行了。又根据各省市办普通话读音训练班的经验，语文教师经过四个到五个星期的集中学习，就能够掌握字母的发音和拼法，以及北京语音的规律，并且能够传授给别人。
    当然学会普通话不是几小时能够办到的。学会汉语拼音方案（草案）的字母的发音和拼法，还要进一步学会念读和拼写普通话的411个左右的基本音节，并通过声调的标注，可以正确地依照声调来发音。在这个基础上，我们可以通过用字母注音的或者用字母拼写出来的普通话读本，来练习念读或者讲话。掌握了字母的发音和拼法以及普通话的音节后，通过多听、多讲、多读、多写，我们在一定时间内都能够学会普通话。
    在方言地区，我们还可以用字母来拼音，作出方言语音和北京语音的比较，找出方言语音和北京语音的对应规律，来加速学会普通话。比方在山东的胶东、广西北部、云南等地方，凡是北京语音念чia（ㄐㄧㄚ）的字，那里都念gia（ㄍㄧㄚ）。掌握了这条对应规律后，凡是那里念gia的字，如家、加、嘉、笳等等，都应该改念чia。这样，学习起来更方便，记起来更容易。方言（少数民族语言除外）都是汉语的支流，因而跟北京语音都有或多或少的对应规律。找出方言语音和北京语音的对应规律，对方言地区的人们学习普通话，有很大的帮助。由此可见，拼音字母对于推广普通话的作用是多方面的。等到我们推行拼音文字的时候，因为所拼写出来的就是普通话，学习拼音文字事实上就等于学习普通话。那时候普通话的推广将特别快，这是可以断言的。
