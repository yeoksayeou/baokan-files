Jinan Exhibits Shandong's Famous Products and Handicrafts

The Shandong Province Famous Products and Handicrafts Exhibition currently being held in Jinan City has aroused great interest among visitors from all walks of life. Among the various exquisite handicrafts on display, there is an ivory carving as small as a bean, on which Chairman Mao's Long March poem, with more than sixty characters, is carved. When viewed through a magnifying glass, the characters are small but very clear and meticulous. This was carved by Du Zongfu, an old artist from Qingdao City with more than 30 years of carving experience. In his masterpiece "Spring Ploughing," people can find farmhouses, village roads, distant mountains, trees, and rice paddies on a button-sized round ivory piece through a magnifying glass. There are also nineteen farmers plowing the fields in the picture, with lifelike expressions. The figures, animals, landscapes, flowers, and plants carved by the old artist Du Lan Gui on peach pits are vivid and lifelike.

Also on display are Weifang's gold and silver inlaid lacquerware, the finely woven gold silk straw hats, flower and grass braided baskets, and colorful grass braided tea coasters from Laizhou (formerly known as Ye County), Changyi and surrounding areas, as well as Zichuan's silk Tianxiang silk, Jiaodong tussah silk, and Linqing "Hada" which are sold to Tibet, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia and other places.

    济南展览山东名产和手工艺品
    正在济南市展览的山东省著名产品及手工艺品，引起各界观众的很大兴趣。展出的各种精巧的手工艺品中，有一个小如豆的象牙雕刻品，上面刻着毛主席的长征诗，有六十多个字，用放大镜看去，字虽小而很清晰，一笔不苟。这是青岛市已有三十多年雕刻经验的老艺人杜宗甫雕刻的。他的杰作“春耕图”，人们可以透过放大镜，在一个钮子般大小的圆牙片上找到农舍、村路、远山、树木和稻田，图上还有十九个正在耕地的农民，神态逼真。老艺人都兰桂在桃核上刻出的人物、动物、山水、花卉，生动逼真。
    展出的还有潍坊市嵌金、银丝漆品，掖县、昌邑一带编织精细的金丝草帽、花草辫提篮、五彩草辫茶垫和周村的丝织天香绢、胶东柞丝绸和远销西藏、青海、内蒙古等地的临清“哈达”。
