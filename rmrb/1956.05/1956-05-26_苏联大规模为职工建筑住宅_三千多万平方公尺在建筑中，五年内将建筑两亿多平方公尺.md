Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 25th: According to statistics, the total residential area of workers' housing currently being built in various locations by the Soviet government's ministries and industrial enterprises amounts to 29 million square meters.

In addition, the Soviet Central Municipal Bank has loaned urban workers approximately 1 billion rubles in housing construction loans to help them build 5 million square meters of private housing for themselves this year.

The worker housing construction currently underway in the Soviet Union is only the beginning of the large-scale housing construction work planned for the new Five-Year Plan. According to this plan, in the next five years, the Soviet state will invest in building 205 million square meters of new housing for the working people. This means that, on average, approximately 800,000 families will receive new two- to three-room housing from the state each year.

    苏联大规模为职工建筑住宅
    三千多万平方公尺在建筑中，五年内将建筑两亿多平方公尺
    新华社莫斯科25日电　据统计，现在由苏联政府各部和工业企业出资在各地建筑的职工住宅，共有两千九百万平方公尺的居住面积。
    此外，苏联中央市政银行还贷给城市职工约十亿卢布住宅建设贷款，帮助他们在今年为自己建筑五百万平方公尺的私人住宅。
    目前苏联正在进行的职工住宅建设，只不过是新五年计划所规划的大规模住宅建设工作的开端。根据这个计划，在今后五年中，苏维埃国家将出资为劳动人民建筑两亿零五百万平方公尺的新住宅。这就是说，每年平均将有大约八十万个家庭从国家得到带有两个到三个房间的新住宅。
