Xinhua News Agency, May 18th, Moscow dispatch from TASS: The government delegations of the Soviet Union and France continued their talks in the Kremlin on May 18th.

Xinhua News Agency, May 18th, report from TASS: The leaders of the Soviet Union and France continued their talks in Moscow on May 17th. During the meeting, the two sides discussed the issue of disarmament from all aspects and exchanged views on the issue of providing economic assistance to underdeveloped countries, as well as the situations in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.

After the meeting, Ilyichev, Director of the Information Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, held a press conference at the Central House of Journalists to brief reporters on the day's talks. Baladuc, Director of the Information and Press Department of the French Foreign Ministry, also attended the press conference.

Ilyichev said that when exchanging views on the issue of disarmament, both sides frankly and clearly stated their positions. Both sides believed that the issue of disarmament is one of the most important issues, and that further seeking ways to promote the resolution of this issue is a primary task for the two governments.

When discussing the issue of providing economic assistance to underdeveloped countries, both sides affirmed that this issue deserves serious attention. Mr. Pineau explained the French proposal to establish an agency under the supervision of the United Nations to provide assistance to underdeveloped countries. Khrushchev, Bulganin, and Molotov considered this proposal worthy of attention, and the Soviet government will study this proposal in detail. At the same time, the Soviet side drew the French leaders' attention to the Soviet government's proposal on European economic issues. The French side believed that this proposal did not contradict the French government's draft and that they would study the Soviet proposal.

Ilyichev said that when exchanging views on the Middle East issue, the Soviet and French sides stated their respective views on this issue. When exchanging views on the Far East and Southeast Asia issues, both sides expressed satisfaction with the decision of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina as published in the newspapers.

Finally, Ilyichev answered many questions raised by reporters. One reporter asked him about his opinion on a certain argument of some news agencies, especially American news agencies, that the Soviet Union seemed to be trying to alienate France from its friends, the United States and Britain. Ilyichev replied that this argument is a common trick, a well-known fabrication. The leaders of the Soviet government have stated more than once and now, during the negotiations with the French delegation, stated once again that the Soviet Union has no intention of alienating France from other countries. The Soviet Union's relations with France are not bad, and it has no intention of causing disputes between France and the United States. The Soviet Union hopes to improve relations with France without worsening France's relations with friendly countries.

    苏法两国领导人会谈中认定
    进一步寻求裁军途径是两国主要任务
    新华社18日讯　塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：苏联和法国两国政府代表团，五月十八日在克里姆林宫继续会谈。
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联和法国的领导人五月十七日在莫斯科继续进行会谈。在会谈中，双方从各方面讨论了裁军问题，并且就对不发达国家进行经济援助问题以及中近东和东南亚局势问题交换了意见。
    会谈结束后，苏联外交部新闻司司长伊利切夫在中央新闻工作者之家举行记者招待会，向记者们介绍了这一天会谈的情况。法国外交部情报新闻司司长巴拉杜克也参加了这次记者招待会。
    伊利切夫说，在就裁军问题交换意见的时候，双方坦率和明白地说明了自己的立场。双方认为，裁军问题是最重要的问题之一，进一步寻求促成这一问题解决的途径是两国政府的主要任务。
    在讨论关于给予不发达国家经济援助的问题的时候，双方肯定地认为，这个问题值得予以严重的注意。比诺先生说明了法国提出的在联合国的监督下设立给予不发达国家援助的机构的草案。赫鲁晓夫、布尔加宁和莫洛托夫认为这个主张是值得注意的，苏联政府将详细研究这个建议。苏联方面同时提请法国领导人注意苏联政府提出的关于欧洲国家经济问题的建议。法国方面认为，这个建议是同法国政府的草案不相抵触的，他们将研究苏联的建议。
    伊利切夫说，在就中近东问题交换意见的时候，苏法双方都说明了自己在这个问题上的观点。在就远东和东南亚问题交换意见的时候，双方对报纸上发表的关于印度支那问题日内瓦会议的两位主席的决定表示满意。
    最后，伊利切夫回答了许多记者提出的问题。有一个记者请他谈谈他对某些新闻机构，特别是美国的新闻机构的一种论调的意见，这种论调就是：苏联似乎要离间法国跟它的朋友美国和英国之间的关系。伊利切夫回答说，这种论调是一种惯技，是尽人皆知的捏造。苏联政府的领导人曾经不止一次地表示过而且现在同法国代表团谈判期间又一次表示，苏联决不打算离间法国同其他国家的关系。苏联同法国的关系不坏，它没有打算使法国同美国发生争执。苏联希望改善同法国的关系，而不使法国同友好国家的关系恶化。
