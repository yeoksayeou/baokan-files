Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 30th. German Democratic Republic Premier Grotewohl delivered a government statement in the People's Chamber on May 29th, proposing eight suggestions to the West German government for easing internal German tensions. Grotewohl stated that the GDR is prepared to conduct negotiations with West Germany to further ease the situation and determine the steps towards the peaceful reunification of Germany.

The content of the eight new suggestions proposed by Grotewohl is as follows:

(1) Both German states guarantee not to implement conscription and reach an agreement on the limits of armed forces.

(2) Both governments, jointly or separately, commit to prohibiting the storage of atomic artillery and other atomic weapons on German territory.

(3) Both German governments, as well as the municipal governments of Greater Berlin and West Berlin, jointly protest the restriction of sovereignty due to the presence of foreign espionage agencies within West Berlin.

(4) End the persecution in West Germany of groups dedicated to opposing militarism, advocating democracy and people's friendship, cancel the investigations of members of these groups, and release those who have been arrested.

(5) Prohibit the activities of all militaristic and neo-fascist groups within West Germany and thoroughly purge Nazis and anti-Semitic elements from administrative and judicial institutions.

(6) Both governments should formulate the same punitive regulations in both parts of Germany for acts that incite war and stir up racial and national hatred.

(7) Both governments declare their willingness to do everything possible to promote the development of trade, cultural and scientific relations between the two German states.

(8) Promote personal contact between representatives of the people's representative bodies of the GDR and West Germany, representatives of various political parties, and mutual exchanges of parliamentary delegations.

In his statement, Grotewohl reiterated the GDR government's position: West Germany's withdrawal from aggressive military treaties is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving German reunification on a peaceful and democratic basis. In order to peacefully resolve the German question, it is necessary to create the necessary conditions both externally and internally. The external condition is disarmament measures and the establishment of a European security system, making the existence of military blocs superfluous. The internal condition is the abolition of militarist rule in West Germany, and the reaching of an understanding between the two German states through negotiations.

Grotewohl accused the West German ruling clique of pursuing a cold war and a policy of strength. He said that West Germany's current attempt to implement conscription is creating new obstacles on the road to reunification. He emphasized that the issue of holding negotiations between East and West Germany cannot be avoided. The later the Bonn government officials realize this, the more unfavorable it will be for them, because their position is weakening day by day.

After discussion, the People's Chamber unanimously adopted a resolution endorsing the government statement made by Grotewohl and the suggestions contained therein. The resolution stated that the People's Chamber supports the government's proposal to have a committee composed of representatives from both parts of Germany study the issues raised by both sides, and believes that this proposal is the first step towards holding negotiations between the two German governments. The People's Chamber called on all well-meaning Germans to strive with all their might to reach an all-German agreement.

    通过谈判缓和德国内部局势走向和平统一
    格罗提渥向西德政府提出八点新建议
    新华社柏林30日电　德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥五月二十九日在人民议院发表政府声明，向西德政府提出了缓和德国内部紧张局势的八点建议。格罗提渥表示，民主德国准备同西德进行谈判，来进一步缓和局势和决定走向和平统一德国的步骤。
    格罗提渥提出的八点新建议的内容是：
    （一）两个德国保证不实行征兵，并且就武装力量的限额问题达成协议。
    （二）两国政府共同或者单独地致力于禁止在德国国土上储存原子炮和其他原子武器。
    （三）两个德国政府以及大柏林市政府和西柏林市政府共同抗议由于西柏林境内存在着外国间谍机关而使主权受到限制。
    （四）在西德停止对那些致力于反对军国主义、主张民主和人民友好的团体的迫害，取消对这些团体的会员所进行的侦讯，释放被捕的人。
    （五）禁止西德境内的一切军国主义团体和新法西斯主义团体的活动，彻底清洗行政和司法机构中的纳粹和反犹太分子。
    （六）对煽动战争、挑拨种族和人民仇恨的行为，两个政府应在德国两部分制定出同样的惩罚条例。
    （七）两国政府宣布愿以全力促进两个德国之间的贸易、文化和科学关系的发展。
    （八）应该促进民主德国和西德人民代表机构的代表、各政党代表之间的个人接触以及相互交换议会代表团。
    格罗提渥在声明里重申民主德国政府的态度：西德退出侵略性的军事条约是在和平和民主基础上达成德国统一的一个基本前提。为了和平解决德国问题，需要从外部和内部创造必要条件。外部条件是裁军措施以及建立欧洲安全体系，使军事集团的存在成为多余的。内部条件是在西德废除军国主义统治，两个德国通过谈判来达成谅解。
    格罗提渥指责西德统治集团奉行冷战和实力政策。他说，目前西德企图实行征兵是要在统一的道路上造成新的障碍。他强调说，东西德举行谈判的问题是不容规避的。波恩政府人士愈迟认识这一点，对他们就愈不利，因为他们的地位正在日益削弱。
    人民议院在经过讨论以后一致通过决议，赞成格罗提渥所作的政府声明以及声明中的各项建议。决议说，人民议院支持政府提出的关于由德国两个部分的代表所组成的委员会对双方提出的问题进行研究的建议，并且认为这个建议是走向两个德国政府之间举行谈判的第一个步骤。人民议院号召一切善良的德国人用一切力量争取达成全德协议。
