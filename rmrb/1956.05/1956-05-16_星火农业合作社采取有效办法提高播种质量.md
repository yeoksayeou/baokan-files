The Xinghuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhongyang County, Shanxi Province, has adopted five fixed measures to improve the quality of sowing: first, fixed leadership with management committee members assigned specific responsibilities; second, fixed labor for cultivation areas and draft animal power assigned to specific cultivation teams; third, fixed quantity and fixed quality; fourth, fixed work points and fixed time; and fifth, fixed technical personnel (for seed soaking and mixing, and operating plows and seed drills). This approach has strengthened the sense of responsibility among cooperative cadres, stimulated the labor enthusiasm of cooperative members, and overcome the past tendencies of chaotic labor and members prioritizing earning more work points by focusing on speed at the expense of sowing quality. This has accelerated the sowing speed and improved the sowing quality. Since the start of sowing, within five days, the cooperative organized all 847 male and female laborers, 48 cattle, and 5 horses into a rush-sowing shock team, planting a total of 710 mu of corn, including 455 mu of hill-drop planting. Sixty dan of fertilizer were applied according to plan, and dense planting was carried out, reaching 1,820 plants per mu. The 255 mu of mountain corn land were all planted in furrows, reaching 1,450 plants per mu. The original plan was to apply 30 dan of fertilizer, but 36 dan were applied instead. The seeds for the 754 mu of cotton were selected and soaked. Thirty-five dan of fertilizer were applied, exceeding the original plan by 3 dan. In addition, 100 mu of vegetables and 1,159 mu of black beans were sown. At the same time, labor was also drawn to dig five drought-resistant wells, deliver 5,382 dan of fertilizer, dig twelve pits, and accumulate 600 dan of fertilizer.

    星火农业合作社采取有效办法提高播种质量
    山西省中阳县星火农业生产合作社，为了提高播种质量，采取了五项固定的办法：一是领导固定，管理委员分工，二是劳力固定耕作区，畜力固定耕作队，三是数量固定，质量固定，四是工数固定，时间固定，五是技术人员（浸拌种和掌犁摇耧）固定。这个办法加强了社干部的责任心，刺激了社员的劳动积极性，克服了过去劳力混乱和社员为了多赚工分只图快不顾播种质量的偏向。加快了播种速度，提高了播种质量。从开始播种以来，五天内，组织了全社八百四十七个男女劳动力和四十八头牛、五匹马，组成抢种突击队，共种玉米七百一十亩，其中包窝点种四百五十五亩，按计划施了六十担肥，并进行了密植，每亩达一千八百二十株。二百五十五亩山地玉米都进行了沟垅种植，每亩达一千四百五十株，原计划施肥三十担，结果施肥三十六担。播种的七百五十四亩棉花种籽进行了粒选、浸种。施肥三十五担超过了原计划三担。此外还播种了蔬菜一百亩，黑豆一千一百五十九亩。与此同时，还抽出劳动力，挖成旱井五眼，送肥5，382担，打坑十二盘，积肥六百担。
