Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 17th: Seoul dispatch: The nearly complete results of the South Korean presidential election held on May 15th show that Syngman Rhee, who relies on bayonets to obtain a majority of votes, has greatly weakened his power in South Korea.

　　In Seoul, where the Syngman Rhee government is located, and Daegu, another major city in South Korea, Syngman Rhee received the second highest number of votes. According to the Associated Press today, more than 90% of the total votes have been counted. Among them, Syngman Rhee only received 55% of the votes. In the 1952 election, he received 72.6% of all votes. According to the Associated Press, Syngman Rhee was still able to obtain a slight majority in this election by relying on the Liberal Party's "nationwide organization, abundant financial resources, and control over the police."

　　The director-general of Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party campaign admitted that the Syngman Rhee government was uneasy about Syngman Rhee's poor showing in the cities. He said that this situation might cause "international distrust."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 18th: Seoul dispatch: Syngman Rhee is now trying to save his designated vice presidential candidate, Lee Ki-poong, from defeat by sabotaging the vote counting.

　　So far, the results of the South Korean vice presidential election are nearly complete, and Lee Ki-poong has received more than 87,000 votes less than Chang Myun. Only about 170,000 votes remain to be counted in three districts of Daegu. Daegu is one of the main areas opposing Syngman Rhee, where Syngman Rhee lost to the opposition party's candidate.

　　Syngman Rhee's cabinet and election officials held a secret meeting on May 17th. After this meeting, the Central Election Management Committee immediately stopped the vote counting for the vice presidential election, making it impossible to obtain the final result from the remaining votes in Daegu.

　　Syngman Rhee's illegal behavior has been fiercely opposed by voters in Daegu. Thousands of voters gathered around the Daegu Election Committee, demanding the resignation of Syngman Rhee's election officials, and posted slogans on the walls of the committee building, demanding "the cleansing of these election officials." According to United Press International, the situation in Daegu is very tense, and the Seoul Police Headquarters has ordered all of its officers to be ready to go.

    南朝鲜选举证明李承晚的势力已大大削弱
    据新华社平壤17日电　汉城消息：五月十五日举行的南朝鲜总统选举的接近完全的结果表明，依靠刺刀取得多数票的李承晚，在南朝鲜的势力已经大大削弱了。
    在李承晚政府所在地的汉城和南朝鲜另一个主要城市大邱，李承晚所得到的选票都居于第二位。据美联社今天报道，全部选票已经有90％以上揭晓。其中，李承晚仅获得55％的选票。而在1952年那次选举中，他曾经获得全部选票的72.6％。据美联社透露，李承晚在这次选举中所以仍能得到微弱的多数票，他所依靠的是自由党的“遍及全国的组织、丰富的财源和对警察的控制”。
    李承晚的自由党竞选运动总干事承认，李承晚政府对李承晚在各城市中得票情况不佳感到不安。他说，这种情况可能引起“国际上的不信任”。
    据新华社平壤18日电　汉城消息：李承晚现在想以破坏计票的手段，来挽救他所指定的副总统候选人李起鹏免于落选。
    到现在，南朝鲜副总统选举的结果已接近全部揭晓，李起鹏所获得的选票比张勉要少八万七千多票。还没有开票的只剩下大邱的三个选区约十七万多票。而大邱是反对李承晚的主要地区之一，李承晚就在这里败给了反对党的候选人。
    李承晚的内阁和选举官员五月十七日举行了秘密会议，在这次会议后，中央选举事务委员会随即停止了副总统选举的计票工作，使得最后剩下的大邱的选票无法得出最后的结果。
    李承晚这种非法行为遭到大邱选民激烈的反对。数以千计的选民聚集在大邱选举委员会的周围，要求李承晚的选举官员辞职，并且在这个委员会大厦的墙上贴标语，要求“清洗这些选举官员”。据合众社报道，大邱的局势非常紧张，汉城的警察总局已经命令它的全体警官整装待发。
