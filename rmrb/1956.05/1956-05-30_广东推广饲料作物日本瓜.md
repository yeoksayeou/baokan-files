Guangdong Province has decided to extensively propagate and promote the feed crop, Japanese squash, this year. This Japanese squash can produce 3,000 to 5,000 jin of squash per mu annually, with each plant capable of producing over 100 jin of squash. The squash fruit, when cooked, has a sweet and fragrant taste, making it highly palatable for pigs. Moreover, the stems and leaves are soft and juicy, suitable as feed for draught cattle. In mid-May, the Provincial Department of Agriculture had already transferred a batch of Japanese squash seeds and over two hundred seedlings from Hainan Island, distributing them to demonstration farms and agricultural production cooperatives in Shantou, Foshan, Zhanjiang, and other special districts for propagation demonstration and promotion. At the same time, it encourages regions with a customary practice of planting Japanese squash to expand the cultivation area as much as possible to solve the shortage of livestock feed.

    广东推广饲料作物日本瓜
    广东省农业厅决定在今年内大量繁殖和推广饲料作物日本瓜。这种日本瓜每亩年产瓜达三千斤至五千斤，每株可产瓜一百多斤。瓜果煮熟后，味道香甜，猪十分爱吃，而且茎叶柔软多汁，可作耕牛饲料。五月中旬，省农业厅已经从海南岛调进一批日本瓜种子和二百多株种苗，分发给汕头、佛山、湛江等专区的示范农场和农业生产合作社繁殖示范和推广。同时，鼓励那些有习惯种植日本瓜的地区，尽量扩大栽培面积，以解决牲畜饲料的不足。　（李少球）
