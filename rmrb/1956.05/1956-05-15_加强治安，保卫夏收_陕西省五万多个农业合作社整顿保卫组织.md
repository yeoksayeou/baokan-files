Strengthen Public Security, Protect the Summer Harvest
Over 50,000 Agricultural Cooperatives in Shaanxi Province Rectify Security Organizations

The members of over 50,000 agricultural production cooperatives in Shaanxi Province, while celebrating the unprecedented bumper summer harvest that is about to arrive after collectivization, are rectifying security organizations earlier than in previous years to protect over 30 million mu of summer crops.

On the 11th, the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Louzizhang Township, Weinan County, proposed a "no sabotage incident cooperative" initiative to all townships and cooperatives across the province's security organizations.

Currently, there are still more than two weeks before the reaping season in the Guanzhong area, but the members of the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Louzizhang Township, Weinan County, have already prepared for safe harvesting. At the same time, more than 60% of the members of this cooperative have formulated community-loving and protective covenants, and formed patrol teams based on production teams.

Agricultural production cooperatives in various districts of Chang'an County have successively formulated plans to protect the summer harvest. Encouraged by socialist enthusiasm, cooperative members are actively participating in security organizations. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
