The Oriental Red First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lingshi County, Shanxi Province, in order to further improve the quality of sowing, organized its members to carry out a "five comparison" competition between teams, groups, and members based on the "assessment" of preparatory work. The five comparisons are: compare time, compare quality, compare specifications, compare full and strong seedlings, and compare hybridization and intercropping. Before the competition began, cooperative cadres first carried out in-depth ideological mobilization among the members, and announced and explained the content of the competition to the members. During the competition, cooperative cadres went deep into each team to help with the work, specifically solve difficulties, and organized inspection teams to inspect and guide in a timely manner when problems were found. At present, the members are conducting a sowing competition.

    提高播种质量
    山西省灵石县东方红第一农业生产合作社，为了进一步提高播种质量，在备耕工作“评比”的基础上，组织社员开展了队与队、组与组、社员与社员的“五比”竞赛。五比就是比时间、比质量、比规格、比苗全苗旺、比杂交和间作。在竞赛开始前，社干部首先在社员中进行深入的思想发动工作，并向社员公布和讲解竞赛内容。在竞赛运动中，社干部又深入各队帮助工作，具体解决困难，并组织检查组巡视检查，发现问题及时指导。目前社员们正在进行播种竞赛。
