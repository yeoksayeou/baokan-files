Shaanxi Province Commercial Departments Support Farmers in Summer Harvest

    Supply and marketing cooperatives, handicraft production cooperatives, and commercial departments in various parts of Shaanxi Province are actively supporting farmers in the summer harvest.

    Currently, grassroots cooperatives are actively supplying farmers with agricultural tools for the summer harvest. The Chengguan Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Danfeng County has transferred six thousand high-quality, low-priced brooms from mountainous areas to supply farmers.

    Many commercial units are also actively supplying farmers with daily necessities for the summer harvest. A material exchange fair was held in Chengguan Town, Bin County, where state-owned and joint state-private commercial units supplied farmers with large quantities of daily necessities such as oil, salt, vermicelli, general merchandise, and cotton cloth. The joint state-private general merchandise industry in Chengguan Town, Pucheng County, also sent fifteen people who carried goods such as tea, matches, salt, and paper every day, proactively delivering them to farmers' doorsteps for them to choose and purchase.

    陕西省商业部门支援农民夏收
    陕西省各地供销合作社，手工业生产合作社和商业部门都积极支援农民夏收。
    目前各基层社正积极供应农民夏收农具。丹凤县城关供销合作社从山区调运了六千把质量好、价钱便宜的大扫帚供应农民。
    许多商业单位也积极供应农民夏收的生活用品。邠县城关镇举行了物资交流大会，国营和公私合营商业单位供应了农民大量的油、盐、粉条、百货和棉布等日用品。蒲城县城关镇公私合营杂货业还派了十五个人，每天带着茶叶、火柴、食盐、纸张等货物，主动的给农民送上门去，请他们选购。　（陕西人民广播电台）
