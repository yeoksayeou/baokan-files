	75.8% of School-Age Children in Tianjin Now Enrolled

	Tianjin now has 75.8% of its school-age children enrolled in school. After the summer vacation this year, the number of enrolled children will increase to 90% of the school-age population.

	According to statistics from the Tianjin Education Bureau, there are now more than 330,000 primary school students in the city, compared to just over 128,000 in the first half of 1949. A significant feature of the development of primary education is the increasing number of children from worker and farmer families. In 1950, worker and farmer children accounted for only 31% of primary school students in the city; now they account for 47.8%.

	The Tianjin Education Bureau's capital construction department is currently building and expanding 65 primary schools. After the summer vacation, primary schools throughout the city will enroll more than 148,000 new students, an increase of more than 30% over last year. All junior primary graduates will be able to continue their studies in senior primary classes. (Xinhua News Agency)

	Producing More Children's Films

	The children's story film "Brother and Sister," produced by the Changchun Film Studio, has completed its interior shooting and is now beginning location shooting.

	Most of the actors participating in this film are children under the age of ten, with the youngest actor playing "Little Maomao" being only four years old.

	The film is adapted from Ren Daxing's novel "Lu Xiaogang and His Sister" by Yan Gong, the director of "Flowers of the Motherland." Su Li, the director of "Plains Guerrillas," is the director of this film, which is scheduled to be completed in July.

	"Brother and Sister" is the third children's film produced by the Changchun Film Studio. The Changchun Film Studio has established a special children's film research group. This group is now working on writing two film scripts reflecting the Children's Corps during the Red Army era and educating naughty children. (Xinhua News Agency)

	A Children's Toothpaste is Being Produced

	A "Happiness Brand Children's Toothpaste" specifically for children's brushing is now being produced at the Shanghai Joint State-Private Liumanxiang Chemical Products Factory. This toothpaste is scheduled to be available on the market starting on Children's Day, June 1st.

	Ordinary adult toothpaste contains a considerable amount of soap, which can irritate the oral mucosa, making it unsuitable for children. "Happiness Brand Children's Toothpaste" has been manufactured according to a new formula after research by the factory's technicians and consultation with dentists. This toothpaste has both the teeth-cleaning and anti-cavity effects of general toothpaste and does not irritate the oral mucosa.

	Gifts for Children in Distant Places

	A silver-gray "Young Pioneer" small steamboat will soon be shipped from Fuzhou to Shangjiangjia Primary School in Chengguan District, Jingchuan County, Gansu Province. This "Young Pioneer" steamboat is a gift from the children of the "Young Pioneer Shipyard" of the Fujian Provincial Department of Transportation's Shipping Administration Bureau's Staff and Workers' Children's School to the Young Pioneers of this primary school as a gift for Children's Day on June 1st.

	This wooden steamboat is seventy-five centimeters long and weighs seven catties, and is intended for children to learn and enjoy. It was made by the "little workers" of the "Young Pioneer Shipyard" themselves.

	Since its establishment last November, the "Young Pioneer Shipyard" now has more than two hundred little workers. The youngest is nine years old, and the oldest is seventeen or eighteen years old. This semester, they have created many fun boats in their spare time. Among them is a small sampan that can carry 2,000 catties.

	The little workers in the factory have now established contact with Young Pioneers in more than twenty schools across the country. Recently, they thought that children in inland Gansu Province were unlikely to see steamboats, so they set about making this "Young Pioneer" steamboat for them.

	Two New Sets of Radio Exercises for Young Children

	Two new sets of radio exercises for young children - the Second Set of Radio Exercises for Young People and the Second Set of Radio Exercises for Children - will be widely promoted among young children across the country after June 1st.

	The amount of exercise in these two sets of radio exercises is slightly greater than that in the First Set of Radio Exercises for Young People and the First Set of Radio Exercises for Children, and the movements are also more difficult. The purpose is to gradually increase the physical strength and cultivate the dexterity of young children, and promote their physical and mental health.

	The Second Set of Radio Exercises for Young People is suitable for students in the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth grades of elementary school. The Second Set of Radio Exercises for Children is suitable for students in the first and second grades of elementary school. (Xinhua News Agency)

    让儿童生活得更幸福
    天津适龄儿童已有75.8％入学
    天津市已经有75.8％的适龄儿童入学。今年暑期以后，入学的儿童将要增加到占适龄儿童的90％。
    据天津市教育局统计，全市在校的小学生现在共有三十三万多人，而1949年上半年只有十二万八千多人。小学教育发展过程中的显著特点，是学生中工人和农民的子女逐年增多。1950年全市小学生中工农子女只占31％多，现在已经增加到占47.8％。
    天津市教育局的基本建设部门现在正在新建和扩建六十五所小学。暑期后全市小学校将招收十四万八千多名新生，招生名额比去年增加30％多，所有初小毕业生都可以升入高小班读书。　（据新华社讯）
    摄制更多的儿童影片
    长春电影制片厂摄制的儿童故事影片“哥哥和妹妹”已经完成内景拍摄工作，现在开始拍摄外景。
    参加拍摄这部影片的演员大部都是十岁以下的儿童，其中最小的扮演“小毛毛”的演员只有四岁。
    这部影片是由“祖国的花朵”影片导演严恭根据任大星的小说“吕小钢和他的妹妹”编成电影剧本，由“平原游击队”影片导演苏里担任导演，这部影片计划在七月份摄制完成。
    “哥哥和妹妹”是长春电影制片厂摄制的第三部儿童影片。长春电影制片厂已经专门成立了儿童影片研究小组。现在这个小组正着手编写反映红军时代儿童团和教育顽皮儿童的两部电影剧本。　（据新华社讯）
    一种儿童牙膏正在生产
    一种专门给儿童刷牙用的“幸福牌儿童牙膏”，开始在上海公私合营留兰香化学制品厂生产。这种牙膏预定在“六一”儿童节开始供应市场。
    一般成人用的牙膏，含有相当数量的肥皂，对口腔粘膜有刺激作用，因此对于儿童是不适宜的。“幸福牌儿童牙膏”是经过工厂技术人员的研究，又征求了牙科医师的意见，根据新的配方制造的。这种牙膏既有一般牙膏所具有的洁齿防蛀效能，又对口腔粘膜没有刺激性。
    给远方小朋友的礼物
    一艘银灰色的“少年号”小轮船，不日即将由福州运往甘肃省泾川县城关区上蒋家小学。这艘“少年号”轮船是福建省交通厅航运管理局职工子弟学校的“少年造船工厂”的孩子们送给这个小学的少年先锋队作为“六一”儿童节的礼物。
    这艘木料小轮船，长七十五公分，载重七市斤，专供儿童们学习玩赏。它是由“少年造船工厂”的“小工人”自己制作的。
    “少年造船工厂”自去年十一月建立后，现在已经有二百多个小工人。其中最小的是九岁，最大的有十七、八岁。这学期他们在课余时间已经制造出许多好玩的船只。其中有一艘小舢船可载重二千市斤。
    现在厂里的小工人们已经和全国各地二十多个学校的少年先锋队建立联系。最近他们想到祖国内地的甘肃省小朋友不容易见到轮船，于是就动手为他们制作这艘“少年号”轮船。

    两套新的少年儿童广播体操
    两套新的少年儿童广播体操——第二套少年广播体操和第二套儿童广播体操，将要在六月一日以后在全国少年儿童中普遍推行。
    这两套广播体操的运动量比第一套少年广播体操和第一套儿童广播体操稍大些，动作也比较难些，目的是使少年儿童循序渐进地增强体力和培养灵巧性，促进他们的身心健康。
    第二套少年广播体操适合小学三、四、五、六年级的学生作。第二套儿童广播体操适合小学一、二年级的学生作。　（据新华社讯）
