Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 9th. The summer harvest distribution issue, of greatest concern to members of agricultural production cooperatives in Shaanxi Province, has been properly resolved. The province has decided to strive for a 90% increase in agricultural cooperative production this summer, with over 90% of members' individual incomes increasing year by year under normal conditions. The distribution to members should not be less than 65% to 70% of the total income of the cooperative, and no less than 60% at the minimum. This was decided at a recent meeting of heads of production cooperative departments of the CPC Shaanxi Provincial Committee's Rural Work Department and the directly affiliated county committees.

Shaanxi Province has more than 50,000 agricultural production cooperatives, a large portion of which were developed last winter and this spring. Although the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives are healthy, many problems urgently need to be resolved. For example, some members see that certain sideline productions have been stopped within the cooperative and fear that their income will decrease; some members' wheat was planted by the members themselves before joining the cooperative, and it was previously decided that the cooperative would harvest it uniformly. Some members see that this year's wheat is growing well and have ideological fluctuations, with some individuals even wanting whoever plants it to harvest it; also, some members have not participated in distribution and are afraid that it will not be distributed properly and they will suffer losses. Many local party and government leading organs have already paid attention to these issues, but some have not. After discussion at this meeting, everyone unanimously agreed that doing a good job in distribution, striving for increased individual income for over 90% of members, and enabling all members to live better lives is one of the most important tasks in running cooperatives currently. In order to achieve the above goals, rural work cadres in various places should immediately restore all kinds of original sideline productions in rural areas from all aspects, and open up various new production avenues, while also compressing all non-production expenditures and reducing non-production activities in agricultural cooperatives. From now on, attention should be paid to solving the problem of attendance of members with little labor and large populations in agricultural cooperatives, so that everyone can get the labor points they deserve.

During the discussion, it was considered that the handling of green crops should generally maintain the original distribution plan determined when joining the cooperative, but adjustments to the seeds, fertilizers, animal labor, and manual labor invested by members before joining the cooperative that are calculated unreasonably should be appropriately adjusted immediately based on the principle of mutual benefit to make them reasonable. Education should be conducted for members whose thinking has fluctuated because they see that the wheat is good, even though it was handled reasonably in the past, to explain that the good growth of wheat is greatly related to the cooperative's processing and fertilization. In short, ideologically, the cooperative cadres should be open, and the members should be open; economically, mutual benefit should be achieved, taking into account both the collective interests of the cooperative and the individual interests of the members. In addition, everyone believes that all summer harvest preparation work should be done well at present, educating members to pay attention to improving harvesting and threshing techniques, and preventing phenomena such as ear dropping and grain loss.

In order to do a good job in summer harvest distribution, everyone believes that a round of education on distribution issues should be conducted among all members at present, and each county should generally hold a meeting of agricultural cooperative directors and accountants before the summer harvest, and agricultural cooperatives should generally hold a general meeting of members or a meeting of member representatives to discuss distribution methods, repeatedly study and formulate and pass pre-distribution plans. Accountancy instructors of agricultural cooperatives and clerks of township people's committees should also specifically help the cooperatives do a good job in summer harvest distribution. In addition, based on the current management and operation situation of agricultural cooperatives in Shaanxi Province, the meeting decided to concentrate efforts to promote the work of contracting work and production and labor quotas before the summer harvest in order to carry out the summer harvest more orderly.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 6th. Wheat and rapeseed on both sides of the Yangtze and Han rivers are about to be harvested. Agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of Hubei Province have already started pre-distribution work for the summer harvest. The pilot work of summer harvest pre-distribution, which was launched in more than 2,000 cooperatives in various counties throughout the province from mid-April, has now basically ended, and most counties are summarizing experiences and training cadres.

Summer harvest crops in Hubei Province account for only about 20% to 25% of the province's annual agricultural harvest. The CPC Hubei Provincial Committee has stipulated that the principle of "less deduction and more distribution" must be adhered to in the summer harvest pre-distribution according to the needs of the lives of members of agricultural production cooperatives, requiring party committees at all levels to ensure that the actual income of members accounts for more than 75% to 85% of the current season's income. The pilot cooperatives that have completed the summer harvest pre-distribution work have all met this requirement.

    争取90％的农业社增产、90％以上的社员增加收入
　　陕西省动手解决社员关心的夏收分配问题
    湖北省各地农业合作社开始夏收预分并将坚持“少扣多分”的原则
　　新华社西安9日电  陕西省农业生产合作社社员最关心的夏收分配问题，已经获得妥善解决。这个省决定在今年夏收中争取使90％的农业社产量增加，90％以上的社员个人收入在正常年景下年年增加，给社员分配的不得少于全社总收入的65％到70％，最低不得少于60％。这是最近中共陕西省委员会农村工作部召开的各地中共地委和直属县委生产合作部长会议上决定的。
    陕西省共有五万多个农业生产合作社，其中有很大一部分是在去冬和今春发展起来的。虽然绝大多数农业社都是健康的，但是有不少问题急待解决，例如有些社员看到社内已经将某些副业生产停止，怕使自己的收入减少；有些社员的麦子是在入社前由社员自己种下的，过去决定由社内统一收获，部分社员看到今年的麦子长得好，思想波动，个别人甚至想谁种谁收；还有些社员由于没有参加过分配，怕分的不合适，使自己吃亏。许多地方党政领导机关已经注意了这些问题，但是还有些没有注意到。经过这次会议讨论，大家一致认为做好分配工作，争取90％以上的社员个人收入增加，使全体社员都能过更好的日子是当前办社中的一个最重要的任务。为了达到上述目的，现在各地农村工作干部应当立即从各个方面把农村中原有的各种副业生产恢复起来，并开辟多种新的生产门路，同时要在农业社中压缩一切非生产的开支，减少非生产的活动。从现在开始并要注意解决农业社内劳力少、人口多的社员的出勤问题，使大家都能得到应有的劳动工分。
    大家在讨论中认为对青苗的处理问题，一般应维持原来入社时确定的分配方案，但对入社前社员投入的种籽、肥料、畜工、人工计算不合理的应立即根据互利原则加以适当调整，使之合理。对有些过去已处理得合理的，但因看到麦子好，思想发生波动的社员应进行教育，说明麦子长得好是和社内加工加肥有很大关系。总之在思想上要作到社干通，社员通；在经济上要做到互利，既照顾社的集体利益，又照顾到社员的个人利益。另外，大家认为目前应做好一切夏收准备工作，教育社员注意改进收、打技术，防止掉穗、落粒等现象。
    为了做好夏收分配工作，大家认为目前应普遍向全体社员进行一次关于分配问题的教育，各县应在夏收前普遍召开一次农业社主任、会计会议，农业社普遍召开一次社员大会或社员代表大会，讨论分配的方法，反复研究制定和通过预分方案。各地农业社的会计辅导员和乡人民委员会的文书等人员也应具体帮助社内做好夏收分配工作。另外，根据陕西省目前农业社的经营管理情况，会议决定在夏收前集中力量推行包工包产和劳动定额的工作，以便更有秩序地进行夏收。
    据新华社武汉6日电  长江、汉水两岸的小麦和菜籽快要收获了。湖北省各地农业生产合作社已经着手进行夏收预分工作。全省各县从四月中旬先后在二千多个社里展开的夏收预分试点工作，现在已经基本结束，大部分县正在总结经验和训练干部。
    湖北省夏收作物，只占全省全年农业收获量的20％到25％左右。中共湖北省委员会根据农业生产合作社社员生活的需要，规定了夏收预分必须坚持“少扣多分”的原则，要求各级党委保证社员的实际收入占本季收入的75％到85％以上。已经结束了夏收预分工作的试点社，都达到了这一要求。
