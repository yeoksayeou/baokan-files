Scientific and Technological Anecdotes

    The Soviet Union Designs a 50 Billion Electron-Volt Synchrotron
    The world's largest synchrotron, built in the Soviet Union and capable of accelerating protons to 10 billion electron-volts, will soon be put into production. The Soviet Union is currently designing an accelerator that will accelerate protons to 50 billion electron-volts.
    This accelerator under design is based on the new design principle of so-called "strong focusing." The accelerator consists of a ring of 120 electromagnets, with a circumference of about 1.5 kilometers. The characteristics of this accelerator are that the electromagnets used weigh only 22,000 tons, 14,000 tons lighter than the electromagnets of the 10 billion electron-volt accelerator; the power consumption is one-third less, and the width of the magnetic circuit is also greatly reduced. The method used in the new accelerator can greatly increase the electromagnetic force, attracting particles to rotate along a circular path, covering a total distance of hundreds of thousands of kilometers.
    The United States Plans to Launch Twelve Artificial Satellites
    During the International Geophysical Year (July 1957 to the end of 1958), the United States plans to launch twelve artificial satellites, hoping that at least eight of them will become "laboratories in space."
    American factories are currently organizing rocket production. American scientists plan to use three-stage rockets to send artificial satellites to the necessary altitude (400-500 kilometers above the ground). In May 1954, an American Viking rocket achieved a single-stage rocket record of 254.2 kilometers.
    At the end of last year, plastic models of artificial satellites and Viking rocket models were exhibited at the Hayden Planetarium of the American Museum of Natural History in New York.
    Poland Invents "Olfactory Electrode"
    After more than ten years of research, Polish scientist Professor Kamenski has invented an "olfactory electrode." This electrode can distinguish and identify whether there are gases in the air that are harmful to health; it can even distinguish gases that some people cannot smell. This is of great significance for labor protection in industry, especially the chemical industry.
    If this electrode is equipped with an electric recording device, it can also help factory workers understand whether there is enough acetylene and hydrogen in the factory workshop to cause an explosion, and prevent harmful gases in the factory from drifting into fields and gardens to destroy plants. After many tests, it has been proven that in the food industry, this instrument can also be used to determine whether meat is rotten.
    Japanese Scientists Use Amniotic Fluid
    to Accurately Predict the Sex of the Fetus
    Japanese scientists have recently used amniotic fluid to accurately predict the sex of more than fifty unborn babies.
    According to the "Tokyo Shimbun" (Tokyo News), Professor Ando Gaichi of Keio University in Tokyo conducted this research based on a Japanese scientist's discovery that female nerve, skin, and mucosal cells have conical chromatin. He inserted a needle into the pregnant woman's abdomen, extracted five milliliters of amniotic fluid from around the fetus, and examined it under a microscope. If conical chromatin was found, it was determined to be a girl, and if not, it was a boy. He applied this method to more than fifty pregnant women, and the prediction results were never wrong.

    苏联设计五百亿电子伏特的同步稳相加速器
    苏联建造的世界上最大的、能把质子加速到一百亿电子伏特的同步稳相加速器，不久就要投入生产。目前苏联正在设计把质子加速到五百亿电子伏特的加速器。
    这个设计中的加速器是以所谓“强聚焦”的新设计原理为根据的。加速器是由一百二十块电磁铁组成的环状物，它的圆周的长度约一公里半。这种加速器的特点是，所用的电磁铁只重两万二千吨，比一百亿电子伏特加速器的电磁铁轻一万四千吨；用电量要少三分之一，磁路的宽度也要大大缩小。新加速器用的方法可以大大提高电磁力，吸引粒子沿着圆形道路转动，它所跑的距离共长几十万公里。
    美国计划发射十二个人造卫星
    在国际地球物理年（1957年7月到1958年底）中，美国计划发射十二个人造卫星，希望至少有八个能够成为“空间的实验室”。
    美国的工厂目前正在组织火箭生产。美国科学家计划利用三段火箭将人造卫星送到必要的高度（离地面四、五百公里的高空）。1954年5月，美国一种维金式火箭曾经达到二百五十四点二公里的单段火箭纪录。
    去年年底，纽约美国自然历史博物馆的海顿太阳系陈列馆里，曾经展出人造卫星的塑胶模型和维金式火箭模型。
    波兰发明“嗅觉电极”
    波兰科学家卡门斯基教授经过十多年的研究以后，发明了一种“嗅觉电极”。这种电极能够分辨并且标明空气中是否存在有害健康的瓦斯；甚至有些人闻不出气味的瓦斯，它也能分辨出来。这对于工业特别是化学工业的劳动保护有重大的意义。
    这种电极如果配上电动纪录装置，还可以帮助工厂的工作人员了解工厂车间中是否有足以引起爆炸的乙炔和氢，并且防止工厂中的有害瓦斯随风飘散到田野、花园中去摧残植物。经过多次试验证明，在食品工业中，这种仪器还可以用来查明肉类是否腐烂。
    日本科学家利用羊膜液
    精确预测胎儿性别
    日本科学家最近利用羊膜液精确地预测出了五十多个未出生婴儿的性别。
    据“东京新闻”报道，东京庆应大学的安藤画一教授根据一位日本科学家关于女性神经、皮肤和粘膜胞中有锥形染色质的发现，进行了这一研究工作。他用针插入孕妇腹部，从胎的周围抽出五西西羊膜液，用显微镜检定。如果发现有锥形染色质就断定是女孩，没有就是男孩。他对五十多个孕妇运用这种方法预测的结果，没有出过一次错。　（新华社）
