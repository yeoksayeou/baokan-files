Do Not Neglect the Production of Small Farm Tools
\tTian Renjie

Since the beginning of spring, small farm tools have been selling quickly in many areas. According to a survey in April, the Mingxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ding County, Hebei Province, lacked a total of 4,282 hoes, scythes, and cart and horse tools. The Huangtugang Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengtai District, Beijing, lacked hundreds of small farm tools such as iron shovels, four-pronged forks, and leek sickles. The Hongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shijing Village, Hejian County, Hebei Province, needed 4,000 sickles, 400 pear pruning shears, and 300 hoe blades, but had nowhere to buy them. In Cang County, Hebei Province, and other places, iron shovels used by farmers to accumulate manure and small shovels used for digging wells were also in short supply.

Although farm tools are small, they have a significant impact on agricultural production. When the Hongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shijing Village, Hejian County, was accumulating manure, some production teams had to suspend work due to a lack of iron shovels. Twenty out of the forty-one female members of the Qian Gangzi Production Team of the Huangtugang Township Agricultural Cooperative in Beijing did not have farm tools, and the production team leader had to spend a lot of time borrowing farm tools every day. Some agricultural production cooperatives in Cang County had to set up their own furnaces to manufacture small farm tools because they could not buy them, but the quality of the tools produced was poor and difficult to use.

The reasons for the shortage of small farm tools are mainly that after full cooperation, the female workforce has increased, and the demand for small farm tools is very large. However, these areas only focus on the production of new farm tools and large farm tools. Some even concentrated the furnaces in towns and villages to produce waterwheel parts, neglecting the arrangement for the production of small farm tools. Some areas were afraid to organize large-scale production this year because they saw that small farm tools were overstocked last year. Or they believed that since a lot of small farm tools were overstocked last year, there would be no shortage this year. Some handicraft production cooperatives believe that large farm tools have high profits and small farm tools have low profits, and are unwilling to produce them.

The above situations show that there is not only a lack of comprehensive planning in the production of small farm tools, but also conservative thinking. Therefore, to reverse the situation of short supply, it is necessary to overcome conservative thinking and conduct comprehensive planning for farm tool production according to the needs of local agricultural production. Areas where the iron industry production cooperative forces in towns and cities are excessively used for the production of large farm tools should quickly adjust a certain amount of force to produce small farm tools. Areas where the production capacity of local iron industry production cooperatives cannot meet the needs should organize handicraft iron industry production cooperatives in large and medium-sized cities to produce more. In order to avoid blind production and overstocking, the production departments should contact agricultural production cooperatives and supply and marketing departments to accurately grasp the required quantity and specifications, so as to avoid both shortages and overstocking.

    不要忽视小农具的生产
    田人杰
    入春以来，不少地区的小农具脱销。据四月份的调查，河北省定县明星农业生产合作社缺锄头、镰刀、车马用具共4，282件，北京市丰台区黄土岗乡农业生产合作社缺少铁铣、四齿和韭菜镰子等小农具上百件，河北河间县诗经村红星农业生产合作社需要镰刀四千把、梨树剪四百个、锄板三百个，都无处购买。河北沧县等地农民积肥用的铁锹，挖井用的小铲，都供不应求。
    农具虽然小，但是对农业生产的影响可不小。河间县诗经村红星农业生产合作社正在积肥的时候，有的生产队便因没有铁锹而歇工。北京黄土岗乡农业合作社前岗子生产队的四十一个女社员，就有二十个人没有农具用，生产队长每天要花很多时间去借农具。沧县有的农业生产合作社因为买不到小农具，只好自设红炉制造，造出来的农具质量差，不好使用。
    造成小农具脱销的原因，主要是全面合作化以后，妇女劳动力增加，需要的小农具数量很大，而这些地区只顾生产新农具和大农具，有的还把集镇、农村的红炉都集中起来生产水车部件，忽视对小农具生产的安排。有的地区因为看见去年小农具积压了，今年就不敢大量组织生产。或者认为去年积压不少小农具，今年就不会脱销。有些手工业生产合作社认为大农具利润大，小农具利润小，不愿生产。
    以上这些情况说明，在小农具的生产方面，不只缺乏全面规划，而且还有保守思想。因此要扭转脱销的局面，必须克服保守思想，根据当地农业生产的需要，进行农具生产的全面规划。凡是把城镇铁业生产合作社力量过多地用于生产大农具的地区，应该迅速调整一定力量生产小农具。凡是当地铁业生产合作社生产能力不能满足需要的地区，应该组织大中城市的手工业铁业生产合作社多生产一些。为了避免盲目生产，造成积压，生产部门就要通过同农业生产合作社和供销部门的联系，切实掌握需要的数量和规格，做到既不脱销，又不积压。
