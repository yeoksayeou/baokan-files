Xinhua News Agency, 7th. According to a France-Presse report, Philippine President Magsaysay ordered the closure of all military schools on May 5th, dispatching officers and students from these schools to participate in military operations against the Philippine People's Liberation Army. The schools ordered to be closed are the Command and Staff, Ground Combat, Logistics, and Officer Schools. These schools have a total of approximately one thousand officers and students.

    菲律宾政府在军事行动失利后
    准备再度进攻人民解放军
    新华社7日讯  据法新社报道，菲律宾总统麦格赛赛在五月五日命令关闭所有军事学校，派遣这些学校的军官和学员去参加进攻菲律宾人民解放军的军事行动。奉命关闭的是指挥和参谋、地面作战、后勤和警官学校。这些学校共有大约一千名军官和学员。
    这个行动是在菲律宾政府最近发动的一次进攻菲律宾人民解放军的大规模军事行动遭到失利之后采取的。麦格赛赛已经在五月二日解除了指挥这次军事行动的第二军区司令艾尔弗雷多·桑托斯准将的职务。
