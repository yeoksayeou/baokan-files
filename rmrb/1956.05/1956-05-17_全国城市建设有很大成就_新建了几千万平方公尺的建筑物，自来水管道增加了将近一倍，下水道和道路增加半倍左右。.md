    Great Achievements in National Urban Construction
    Tens of millions of square meters of buildings have been newly built, the length of water supply pipelines has almost doubled, and the length of sewers and roads has increased by about half.
    Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: Minister of Urban Construction Wan Li said today that China's urban construction has achieved great success. In the first three years of the First Five-Year Plan, the construction units under the Ministry of Urban Construction alone completed new buildings such as residential buildings, offices, schools, and hospitals with a total area of 43 million square meters.
    Wan Li said this when he made a report at the meeting of advanced producer representatives of the Ministry of Construction Engineering and the Ministry of Urban Construction. He also said that from 1949 to 1955, the length of water supply pipelines across the country almost doubled, and the length of sewers and roads increased by about half. In addition, considerable achievements have also been made in urban survey and mapping, urban planning, and other aspects.
    Wan Li also said that in recent years, urban construction has been carried out according to national plans. The development of urban construction work has not only effectively cooperated with industrial construction, but also, to a certain extent, changed the face of cities and facilitated people's lives.
    In his report, Wan Li pointed out that the urban construction tasks in the future will be more arduous. This year alone, the tasks of urban survey and mapping, urban planning, etc. have exceeded the sum of the past three years. In the next few years, in addition to renovating and expanding existing cities, many new industrial cities will also be built in remote areas. Therefore, civil construction engineering tasks and municipal construction tasks will be greatly increased.

    全国城市建设有很大成就
    新建了几千万平方公尺的建筑物，自来水管道增加了将近一倍，下水道和道路增加半倍左右。
    据新华社15日讯　城市建设部部长万里今天说，中国城市建设已获得很大成就，在第一个五年计划前三年里，仅城市建设部所属施工单位就建成面积共达四千三百万平方公尺的住宅、办公室、学校和医院等新的建筑物。
    万里是在建筑工程部和城市建设部先进生产者代表会议上作报告的时候说的。他又说，从1949年到1955年，全国自来水管道增加了将近一倍，下水道和道路增加了半倍左右。此外，在城市勘察测量、城市规划等方面也已经取得了不小的成绩。
    万里还说，几年来，城市建设是根据国家计划进行的。城市建设工作的开展，不但有力地配合了工业建设，而且在一定程度上，改变了城市的面貌，便利了人民的生活。
    万里在报告中指出，今后的城市建设任务将会更加繁重。今年单是城市勘察测量、城市规划等任务就超过了过去三年的总和。在今后若干年内，除改建和扩建原有的城市以外，还要在边远地区建设许多新的工业城市，因此，民用建筑工程任务和市政建设施工任务都要大大增加。
