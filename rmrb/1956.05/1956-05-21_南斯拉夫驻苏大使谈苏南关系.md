Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 19th: TASS reports that the Yugoslav Ambassador to the Soviet Union, V. Micunovic, stated during a speech on Moscow Radio and Television on the 18th that friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia have the broadest prospects. This cooperation is not only beneficial to the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia but also impacts a wide range of international relations.

In his speech, delivered in celebration of the upcoming first anniversary of the Soviet-Yugoslav talks, Micunovic pointed out that many of the specific measures approved in the Soviet-Yugoslav talks declaration for establishing normal relations and friendly cooperation between the two countries have already been implemented. The achievements already made in this regard best confirm the positive significance of the agreements reached in Belgrade last year.

Micunovic then said that President Tito's upcoming official visit to the Soviet Union is of extraordinary significance for the further development of friendly relations between the two countries. We believe that this visit will promote understanding, trust, and peaceful cooperation between the people of the two countries.

Micunovic said that in our country, everyone knows the efforts made by the Soviet government to ease international tensions and for peaceful cooperation between countries. We believe that the recent decision by the Soviet government to significantly reduce its armed forces is one of the best examples of constructive efforts, and we believe this is a direct and successful step towards further easing international tensions and safeguarding world peace.

    南斯拉夫驻苏大使谈苏南关系
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科十九日讯：南斯拉夫驻苏联大使维·米丘诺维奇十八日在莫斯科电台和电视台发表演说的时候说，苏联和南斯拉夫两国之间的友谊和合作有着最广泛的前途。这种合作不仅对于苏南两国是有益的，而且对范围广泛的国际关系产生了影响。
    米丘诺维奇在他为庆祝即将到来的苏南会谈一周年而发表的演说中指出，苏南会谈宣言中所批准的为建立苏南两国之间的正常关系和友好合作而作出的具体措施中，有许多已经实现了。在这方面已经取得的成果，最好地证实了去年在贝尔格莱德达成的协定的积极意义。
    米丘诺维奇接着说，铁托总统即将到苏联进行的正式访问，对两国友好关系的进一步发展，具有异常重要的意义。我们相信这次访问将会促进两国人民之间的谅解、信任和和平合作。
    米丘诺维奇说，在我国，人人都知道苏联政府为缓和国际紧张局势以及为各国之间的和平合作而作的努力。我们认为，苏联政府最近作出的关于大量裁减武装部队的决定是建设性的努力的最好的范例之一，我们认为这是走向进一步缓和国际紧张局势和保卫世界和平的一个直接的和成功的步骤。
