　　中罗乒乓球队举行最后一次比赛
    本报5日讯　今晚是罗马尼亚乒乓球队同我国乒乓球队在北京举行的第三次友谊比赛。
    今晚最先进行的是女子团体赛。泽勒尔对孙梅英，罗齐亚努对丘钟惠。两位客人守得稳、攻得准，都以二比○取胜。罗齐亚努、泽勒尔对孙梅英、丘钟惠的双打，客人也以二比○获胜。总比分三比○，罗马尼亚队胜。

    杨开运对哈拉斯托西是今晚八场比赛中的第七场。这一场比赛引起了观众的极大兴趣。杨开运是1955年我国乒乓球冠军赛的第二十名。他的对手是罗马尼亚乒乓球男子单打的冠军哈拉斯托西。哈拉斯托西左右抽球很厉害，救球也很稳当。杨开运针对对方特点采取了一长一短的打法，并且把球尽量攻向哈拉斯托西的胸前。这一来横握球拍的哈拉斯托西几乎完全陷于被动，第一局以十一比二十一失败。第二局，哈拉斯托西多次抢救了险球，以二十一比十八扳回一局。第三局，哈拉斯托西加强攻势，而杨开运抽得更猛、吊得更短。哈拉斯托西多次抢救长球，却赶不及挡回短球。他俩从十一平角逐到二十平，二十二平，二十四平，最后杨开运以二十六比二十四取得胜利。
    最后一场男子单打，甘特纳对郭毅萍，以二十一比十七和二十一比十二结束，甘特纳轻取胜利。
