    Another Great Joy for the Tibetan People
    Dalai Lama·Danzeng Jiacuo
    The successful opening of the air route from the motherland's capital, Beijing, to Lhasa is a great joy worthy of excitement for all Tibetan monks and laypeople. This is a great victory in the socialist construction of the motherland and another great victory in the transportation construction of Tibet.
    Before liberation, transportation in our Tibetan region was very backward. High mountains and great rivers not only hindered our connection with the mainland of the motherland but also hindered mutual exchanges between people in various parts of Tibet. However, in the short few years after liberation, this situation has greatly changed. The People's Liberation Army entering Tibet and Han worker brothers helped us to build the Kangzang and Qingzang highways from Lhasa to the mainland of the motherland in 1954. Last year, the highways from Lhasa to Xigaze and from Xigaze to Gyantse and Phari were also completed. This year, the highway from Phari to Yadong has also been opened to traffic, and the highway from Heihe to Ali has also been trial-opened. The construction of these highways has greatly changed the transportation landscape of Tibet, closely linked Tibet and the mainland of the motherland, and played a significant role in the development of Tibet's political, economic, cultural, and other construction undertakings. Now, the trial flight of the air route from the motherland's capital, Beijing, to Lhasa has also been successful. This will further strengthen the connection between Tibet and the mainland of the motherland, further strengthen the unity between the Tibetan people and the people of all fraternal ethnic groups in the motherland, and will also play a greater role in the development of Tibet's various construction undertakings. All these facts powerfully illustrate the concern of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao for the Tibetan people. Only under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, and by resolutely taking the socialist road, can we Tibetan people have a bright and happy future. In the future, we Tibetan people should better unite with the People's Liberation Army and working cadres entering Tibet, work together to build a prosperous and happy socialist new Tibet, and repay the care of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao for us with practical actions!
    Here, on behalf of all the monks and laypeople in Tibet, I pay tribute to all the personnel who participated in the trial flight and thank them for their working spirit of overcoming all difficulties and doing good things for the Tibetan people. (Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 26th)

    西藏人民的又一件大喜事
    达赖喇嘛·丹增嘉措
    从祖国首都北京通到拉萨的航空线的胜利通航，是值得西藏全体僧俗人民兴奋的大喜事。这是祖国社会主义建设事业中的一个大胜利，也是西藏交通运输建设事业中的又一伟大胜利。
    解放前，我们西藏地区的交通非常落后，大山大河不但阻碍着我们和祖国内地的联系，而且也阻碍着西藏各地区人民之间的互相往来。但是，解放后的短短几年中，这种情况已经有了很大的改变。进藏人民解放军和汉族工人兄弟帮助我们在1954年修通了从拉萨通到祖国内地的康藏和青藏两条公路，去年又修通了拉萨到日喀则，日喀则到江孜、帕里的公路，今年帕里到亚东的公路也通车了，从黑河到阿里的公路也试线通车了。这些公路的修筑，大大改变了西藏地区的交通面貌，密切了西藏和祖国内地的联系，对西藏地区政治、经济、文化等各项建设事业的发展起了很大的作用。现在，从祖国首都北京到拉萨的航空线也试航成功了，这将会更进一步加强西藏和祖国内地的联系，进一步加强西藏人民和祖国各兄弟民族人民的团结，对发展西藏的各项建设事业，也将会起到更大的作用。以上这些事实有力地说明了中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席对西藏人民的关怀。我们西藏人民也只有在中国共产党和各族人民伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，坚决走社会主义道路，才会有光明幸福的前途。我们西藏人民今后应当更好地和进藏的人民解放军和工作干部团结一致，共同为建设繁荣幸福的社会主义的新西藏而努力，并以此实际行动来报答中国共产党和毛主席对我们的关怀！
    这里，我代表西藏全体僧俗人民，向参加试航工作的全体人员致敬，感谢他们克服一切困难，为西藏人民办好事的工作精神。（新华社拉萨26日电）
