    A problem with dark-colored Shilin cloth used for clothing fading after frequent rubbing has been solved by a new type of fabric dyeing machine used by the Tianjin Textile Dyeing Factory. This machine can make the dye penetrate the fibers, preventing the dyed fabric from fading due to rubbing. The efficiency of this machine in dyeing fabric is very high. A piece of white cloth put into this machine is dyed into colored cloth in less than a minute, whereas it used to take twenty-five minutes.
    This new type of fabric dyeing machine is called the "Continuous Suspension Pad-Roll Dyeing Machine," and it was designed by engineer Ying Yuanzai of the Tianjin Textile Industry Bureau. The Tianjin Textile Dyeing Factory has decided to use this machine to produce more than 20,000 bolts of water-colored cloth in sixteen colors, such as emerald green and magenta, in May to supply consumers for summer clothing.

    新型的染布机
    用深色士林布做衣服因经常磨擦而发白的问题，已经由天津市织染厂使用的一部新型染布机染色，得到解决。这部机器能使染料浸入纤维，染成的布匹就不致因磨擦而发白。这部机器染布的效率很高。一匹白布投入这部机器，不到一分钟就染成了色布，而过去需要二十五分钟。
    这部新型染布机叫“连续悬浮体轧染机”，是天津市纺织工业局工程师应元栽设计的。天津市织染厂决定在五月份用这部机器生产两万多匹石绿、梅红等十六种颜色的水色布，供应消费者做夏季服装。
