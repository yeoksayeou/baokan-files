　　"Xiao Luo, Come and Learn!"
　　Yuan Shuipai
    This wheelhouse is located at the highest point of this four-story pagoda-style large steamship. From a row of more than a dozen large glass windows arranged in a semicircle, one can see the vast scenery of the Yangtze River in front of the bow and on both sides. Overlooking the scene from above, it truly has the aura of a command post. Standing behind the large glass window in the very center is the helmsman. Dressed in a white sailor uniform, black epaulets embroidered with a gold line and a gold anchor indicate the rank of Third Officer. Beneath the white rigid-brimmed hat, short hair covering the ears reveals a healthy, rosy-cheeked female face and a pair of large eyes. She occasionally raises her binoculars to look at the river surface and issues commands to the helmsman standing behind her:
    "Left ten degrees... Right ten degrees..."
    Under the command of this twenty-two-year-old young woman, the "Jiangxin," a four-thousand-ton passenger and cargo ship modeled after the Volga River liners, the fastest and newest on the Yangtze River, cuts through the calm river surface, moving steadily forward.
    At this moment, she bears the entire responsibility for this ship, including the safety of nine hundred tons of cargo and one thousand passengers. Just three years ago, when she first interned in navigation at the Shantou Merchant Marine Technical School in her hometown, she still suffered from seasickness. When she first came to the Yangtze River to learn piloting, some people simply didn't believe that "a little girl" could learn this profession. Until recently, when the captains of various Yangtze River liners held a captains' meeting in Hankou, some people still inquired with a skeptical tone: "How is Luo Liefang really doing?"
    How is she doing? This female pilot is already capable of independently navigating day and night, whether it is a normal channel or a dangerous one, in good weather or bad. The Huangpu River section, which is usually piloted by the captain himself, has also been practiced by Luo Liefang. Now she is learning the final part of piloting skills: berthing and unberthing and entering and leaving ports. Li Qingjiang, the captain of the "Jiangxin," is a famous old pilot on the Yangtze River, and he has trained many excellent pilots, but never a female one. He said that even in the entire history of Chinese navigation, female sailors only began to emerge with Luo Liefang and her cohort. Thirty or forty years ago, only foreigners served as captains, chief mates, second mates, and third mates on coastal and inland river ships in China; there were no Chinese people, let alone women. Women were not allowed in the wheelhouse of a steamship (because the wheelhouse was high, and for a woman to go there was tantamount to standing on someone else's head), and even on ordinary wooden boats, women were not allowed on the bow. If a woman stepped on the foremost crossbeam of a wooden boat, it was considered a great taboo and could cause serious disputes.
    Li Qingjiang, referred to as "Old Captain" by Luo Liefang and other young crew members, although over fifty years old, does not look old at all. He is dressed neatly, in a white poplin shirt, a light brown waistcoat, and neatly pressed trousers. With his hands in his pockets, he paces back and forth in his tidy captain's office, enthusiastically telling visitors about the new Third Officer and recalling the old days. His Mandarin has a slight Cantonese accent: "Before Liberation, merchant marine schools admitted female students a few times, but they all changed careers after graduation. Occasionally, a few went to the ships for internships, but they actually just took a look and returned ashore immediately. Now they are really working. They are learning very well, and in my opinion, they are even better than the men. I think the reason is that women have never had this kind of opportunity before, and now that they have it, they study with single-minded devotion. I can say that Luo Liefang has struggled arduously to get where she is."
    Captain Li took out his diary from the bookshelf, put on his glasses, and turned to the page for January 20, 1956, which was written in red ink with the words "Third Officer Luo Liefang transferred to work" and so on. He said, "When she first came, there was a snowfall once, and the weather was bad, with poor visibility. I sat in the high chair in the wheelhouse, watching her operate, and I thought it was good, very steady. After a few times, I felt relieved and felt that I could let go and let her take the night shift as well. I said, 'I'm going to sleep, you take over. If there is a problem, have the helmsman come and call me, don't worry about losing face, safety is the most important thing.' She is very modest, and when she encounters dangerous channels, she asks me to direct. I said, 'No, you take the helm. If you don't, how can you learn?' I can guarantee that under the leadership of the Party, we can train Luo Liefang to reach the level of Second Officer, Chief Officer, and even Captain..." Captain Li Qingjiang's words were also agreed upon by the political officer, chief mate, and second mate of the "Jiangxin." They accepted the commission from the responsible department of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration and felt that training the first group of female sailors in New China was a glorious task, and so did the other comrades on the ship.
    However, this intention of the Party was not taken seriously from the beginning. During her internship, although Luo Liefang constantly received support and care from the Party and the masses, she was also constantly discriminated against and attacked by the old forces. When Luo Liefang first came to the "Gong'an," another passenger and cargo ship sailing on the Yangtze River, some people on the ship felt uncomfortable. "How come a woman is here!" Some said, "A little girl, learning to be a pilot!" "She's a student and a girl, she doesn't have any strength at all, how can she do the heavy work of a sailor?" They ridiculed her with all sorts of comments.
    According to regulations, learning to be a pilot requires first learning to be a sailor, then learning to steer, and finally learning to navigate. Sailor work is both technical and physical labor. Washing the deck can be tiring enough for a male sailor to make his back ache. Handling and releasing mooring lines not only requires strength, but the wire ropes also have rotational force, and carelessness can easily injure the legs and feet. Painting and chipping rust cannot be considered light work either. Some work even requires hanging the body outside the ship's side. Many sailors on board initially thought that a girl probably couldn't handle these jobs. But Luo Liefang did not retreat. She insisted on working with the sailors, never complaining when she was tired. Her feet were injured time and time again, bleeding, becoming inflamed, and even swollen, but she didn't complain. Regardless of whether it was windy, rainy, hot, or cold, she would take off her shoes, pick up a broom, and start working on the deck. This gradually dispelled the notion that "a female comrade probably can't handle it" and gradually gained the trust of the sailors.
    In addition to studying diligently and enduring hardships, Luo Liefang also paid attention to doing mass work. Many sailors were older and semi-literate, so she helped them write letters. While they were working, she organized the youth to deliver tea to them. She helped those with economic difficulties by reporting their situation to the leaders. After becoming one with everyone, everyone actively came to teach her, and if she wasn't there, they would shout loudly: "Xiao Luo, come and learn!" The old sailors cared for her like their own daughter, not letting her do dangerous work, saying "Don't assign Xiao Luo to the outer file," meaning don't ask her to do work outside the ship's side. A saying was popular among the sailors: "Don't let the locomotive have an accident!" They believed that Luo Liefang was a pioneer of Chinese female sailors, so they called her the locomotive.
    However, there were always twists and turns. There were not a few people who looked down on the new seedlings and looked down on women. During her stage of learning to be a helmsman on the "Jiang'an" ship, she suffered a heavy blow from the captain. That captain was not satisfied with this intern from the start. He said: "You are so young, how can you do it? Don't think that because you see women learning to drive trains, you also want to learn to drive ships. Trains have tracks. When driving a ship, how can you see underwater? Who knows where there are beaches, where there are rocks? Don't think it looks easy when others do it, they are already over fifty years old, an old Yangtze River hand, with more than thirty years of piloting experience, that's how they can walk with their eyes closed at night when they can't see anything. How can you learn it in a year and a half?"
    Encouraged by the Party and the Youth League organizations, Xiao Luo was not intimidated by these words.
    However, once when she was interning in operating the engine telegraph (the equipment on the ship for directing and managing the engine personnel to run fast, slow, stop...), she suddenly, in the case of the helmsman mishearing the captain's order, mistakenly executed the captain's order and turned the "stop" into "slow." The captain's accumulated unpleasant emotions exploded at this time. He loudly reprimanded Luo Liefang and even wanted her to go ashore to work immediately. He roared: "You can't even operate the engine telegraph, and you still want to learn to drive! Messing around, don't learn anymore!"
    Xiao Luo could no longer hold back, she burst into tears on the spot, ran back to her room, collapsed on the bed and cried bitterly, and didn't even eat dinner. Although she didn't fear this captain like some people feared tigers, she also felt that under such discrimination and obstruction of her learning, her studies were hopeless. The captain even deliberately wanted her to learn tallying work, not allowing her to go to the bridge, and threatened other pilots that if anyone let this girl learn to operate, they would be fully responsible for any accidents. And the sailors knew that serious maritime accidents could even result in criminal penalties. Under such blows, she almost wavered.
    However, Luo Liefang received strong support from the Party. In 1954, Luo Liefang joined the Youth League. The Youth League branch secretary often encouraged her, teaching her not to waver, and to use the greatest strength to strengthen her determination. The current Second Officer Song Ruxiu was the Third Officer on the "Jiang'an" at the time and enthusiastically guided her in learning the technology. In this way, after she finished learning the helmsman's skills, she further learned to be a pilot.
    This work was, of course, more complicated and difficult. She had to be familiar with the names of more than three hundred shore markers and buoys along the route from Hankou to Shanghai, she had to understand the safe bearings, and she had to memorize the distances between each crossing heading, shore marker and shore marker, buoy and buoy, and the influence of wind and current pressure on the heading. When she first started learning, she was not familiar with the terrain of the Yangtze River, did not understand the conditions of the riverbed, and could not remember where there were beaches, reefs, or sunken ships. Therefore, in addition to working eight-hour shifts every day, she also tried to make the most of her rest time, and whenever she had the opportunity, she went to the wheelhouse to learn how the old pilots navigated. Even in winter, when it was windy and snowing, she insisted on standing in front of the bridge. Because visibility was poor, the worse the weather, the more she had to open the glass windows. Sometimes snowflakes formed ice on her cotton clothes, and her feet were frozen stiff, but she still stood for eight hours, ten hours, or even twelve hours a day, unwilling to go down.
    What about the conservative captain? Whenever he encountered her, it was either an unreasonable criticism, something like "purely technical viewpoint," or a few jeering remarks: "What? You just got off work, and you're here again? If you learn too much, aren't you afraid of bursting your stomach?" "You have the capitalist style, learning technology to make big money. But, you know, if there is a maritime accident, it is we leaders who lose face!" This captain often satirized the old pilots who enthusiastically taught her: "Adopt her as a goddaughter!"
    The old pilots, on the other hand, said that it was always good for a student to be willing to learn. Some said enthusiastically: "I am old, am I going to take the technology to the coffin? It really makes me happy to see the next generation of young people master the technology. Our skills were learned after suffering many unjust hardships, and we can no longer let the youth in the new society take our old path!"
    The old pilots insisted on the Party's policy of actively cultivating and promoting young people. They took the initiative to teach the aspiring female intern Luo Liefang the technology. When they were operating on the bridge, they often whispered when the captain was not around: "Xiao Luo, come and learn!"
    In this way, Xiao Luo learned the piloting skills and received her Third Officer's license in the spring of 1955.
    Captain Li Qingjiang, who is good at educating juniors, once again said to the visitors, filled with admiration: "Luo Liefang has struggled arduously to get where she is."
    Luo Liefang said with a little shyness and modesty: "I myself am nothing, I want to thank everyone for their help to me and thank the Party for their vigorous cultivation. No matter when, I always remember the people who have helped me. My experience is too little, and I am determined to continue to train myself, study technology, and live up to everyone's expectations."
    "Don't you really have anything yourself?" the visitor asked. "Well, no, it should be said that a young person should rely on the organization, rely on the masses, and rely on oneself!"

　　“小罗，来学！”
　　袁水拍
    这驾驶室位在这艘四层宝塔式大轮船的最高处。从一排圈成一个半圆的十几扇大玻璃窗里，可以望见船头前面以及左右两面辽阔的长江景色。居高临下，的确有司令台的气概。在正中央这扇玻璃窗后面站着的是驾驶员。一身白色的海员制服，黑色的肩章上绣着一道金线，一只金锚，表示是三副职位。白色硬边制帽下露出遮盖两耳的短发，一张健康的红扑扑的女性的脸，一对大眼睛。她不时举起望远镜了望江面，并且向站在她背后的舵工发出命令：
    “左十度……右十度……”
    就在这个二十二岁的女青年的指挥下，这艘长江上航速最大，最新型的、仿照伏尔加河航轮修建的四千吨客货轮“江新号”，划开平静的江面，稳稳地前进着。
    此刻她的肩头担负着这艘船的全部责任，包括九百吨货和一千名旅客的安全。仅仅三年以前，当她在家乡汕头的商船技术学校第一次实习航海的时候，她还晕船；当她刚到长江上来学习驾驶的时候，有些人怎么也不信“一个小丫头”学得会这一行；直到最近，长江各航轮的船长们在汉口开船长会议的时候，也还有些人用怀疑的口吻探问：“罗烈芳到底怎么样？”
    怎么样？这位女驾驶员已经能够单独日夜领航了，不管是一般的航道，还是危险的航道；好天气，还是坏天气。照例必须由船长亲自领航的黄浦江这段航道，也曾经由罗烈芳练习领航过。现在她正在学驾驶技术的最后一部分：靠离码头和进出港口。“江新号”船长李庆江是长江上著名的老领港，经他的手培养出来的优秀的驾驶员已经有不少，只是女的还没有过。他说，那怕在中国整个航海史上也只是从罗烈芳这一批开始才有了女海员。三、四十年前，在中国沿海和内河轮船上当船长、大副、二副、三副的，只有外国人，没有中国人，更不要说是妇女了。轮船的驾驶室里，女的固然不能去（因为驾驶室高，女的去了，就等于站在人家的头上），便是普通木船的船头，女的也不能去，木船头上最前面的一块横木，要是被女人踩着了，那就是极大的忌讳，会引起严重纠纷。
    在罗烈芳和其他青年船员口中称为“老船长”的李庆江，虽则已经有五十多岁，看来却一点也不老。他穿得很整洁，白府绸衬衫，淡咖啡色西装背心和熨平了的裤子。他两手插在裤袋里，收拾得整整齐齐的船长室里，一面来回踱着，一面兴致勃勃地对访问者讲述着新三副的事以及对旧时代的回忆，他的普通话稍许带有广东口音：“解放前，商船学校里收过几回女学生，可是毕业后都改行了。偶然也有几个到船上去实习，实际却只是参观一下，马上回岸上去。现在才是真的干。学习得很好，照我看来，男的还比不上她们。这原因，我想是，女的从来没有得到过这种机会，现在得到了，就专心一志地学。我可以说，罗烈芳是艰苦奋斗出来的。”
    李船长从书架上取下他的日记本，戴上眼镜，翻到1956年1月20日那一页，上面用红墨水笔写着三副罗烈芳调来工作等字样。他说：“她刚来的时候，有一次下雪，天气坏，视线不清，我坐在驾驶室的高脚椅子上，看她操作，觉得不错，很稳重。经过几次以后，我就放了心，觉得可以放手，晚上也让她当班。我说，我去睡了，你来走。有问题，就叫舵工来叫我，不要爱面子，安全是最重要的。她很虚心，遇到危险航道，就要我来指挥。我说，不行，你走。不走，你怎么能会。我可以保证，在党的领导下，我们能够培养罗烈芳，使她的技术达到二副、大副，以至船长……的水平。”李庆江这句话也得到了“江新号”的政治协理员、大副、二副的同意。二副宋汝修是一向关心她的。他们接受了长江航运管理局负责方面的委托，都感到培养新中国的第一批女海员是光荣任务，船上的其他同志也是这样。
    但是，党的这个意图并不是一开始就这样受到重视的。在实习期间，罗烈芳虽则不断地受到党和群众的支持和爱护，却也不断地受到旧势力的歧视和打击。罗烈芳刚到航行长江的另一艘客货轮“工安号”上实习，船上就有一些人觉得看不顺眼。“怎么来了一个女的！”有的说：“一个小女孩，学啥驾驶员！”“学生子出身，又是个丫头，一点力气也没有，怎么能干水手的重活？”七嘴八舌，嘲笑一通。
    按照规距，学驾驶得先学水手，再学操舵，最后才学领航。水手工作是技术，又是体力劳动。洗甲板对一个男性水手来说，也要累得腰酸腿痛。带缆、解缆不仅费力气，纲丝还有回转力，一不小心就会打伤腿和脚。打油漆、敲铁锈也不能说是轻活。有些工作还要把身子吊在船舷外去做。船上不少水手开头都认为，这些工作，一个女孩子恐怕吃不消。可是罗烈芳并没有退缩，她坚持着和水手们一起干活，累了也不说；脚打伤了一回又一回，流血，发炎以至发肿，也不叫苦。不管刮风下雨，天热天冷，她鞋子一脱，拿起扫把，就在甲板上干起来。这样就逐渐打消了那个“女同志恐怕吃不消”的看法，逐渐取得了水手们的信任。
    除了刻苦耐劳地学习以外，罗烈芳还很注意做群众工作。不少水手年纪大了，半文盲，她就帮他们写信。在他们工作的时候，把青年组织起来给他们送茶水。有经济困难的她帮他向领导人反映。和大家打成一片以后，大家就主动地来教她，见她不在，也会大声地喊：“小罗，来学！”老水手们像爱自己女儿那样爱护她，不让她干危险的活，说“外档莫派小罗”，意思就是不要叫她做舷外的工作。水手当中流行着这样一句话：“莫让火车头出了事！”他们认为罗烈芳是中国女海员的先锋，所以叫她火车头。
    但是，波折总是有的，看不起新生的幼苗，看不起女性的人，并不很少。在“江安”轮学舵工的阶段，她就受到过来自船长的沉重的打击。那位船长一开始就不满意这个实习生。他说：“你年纪这样小，怎么能行？你不要看见有女的学开火车，就也想学开轮船。火车是有轨道的。开轮船呢，水底下你怎么看得见？哪里有沙滩，哪里有石头，谁会知道？你别看人家干起来好像蛮容易，人家已经五十多岁，老长江，领航三十多年，这样才能够在夜里什么都看不见的时候，闭起眼睛来也能走路。一年半载，哪能学得会？”
    在党和团组织的鼓励下，小罗并没有被这些话所吓倒。
    可是有一次当她实习摇车钟（船上指挥管理轮机人员开快车、慢车、停车……的设备）的时候，她忽然在舵工误听船长的命令的情况下，错误地执行了船长的命令，把“停车”摇成“慢车”。船长平时累积的不愉快的情绪，此时就一起爆发了出来，他大声地训斥罗烈芳，甚至要她立刻上岸去工作，他咆哮道：“连车钟也不会摇，还想学驾驶！乱搞一气，快不要学了！”
    小罗再也忍不住了，她当场掉了眼泪，奔回自己房间，倒在床上痛哭，连饭也没有吃。她虽则没有像有些人那样害怕这位船长像害怕老虎一样，可是也觉得在这样一种歧视和阻挠她学习的势力下，她的学习是没有希望了。船长甚至故意要她去学理货工作，不让她上驾驶台，并且恐吓别的驾驶员，谁要是让这个丫头学习操作，出了事，就得由他负全部责任。而海员们知道，出了严重的海事，是甚至要受刑事处分的。在这样的打击下，她几乎动摇了。
    但是，罗烈芳得到了党的大力支持。1954年罗烈芳入了团。团支部书记经常鼓励她，教导她不能动摇，应该用最大的力量来坚定自己的决心。现在的二副宋汝修当时在“江安”任三副，热心地指导她学习技术。就这样，她学完了舵工的技术之后，进一步再学驾驶。
    这个工作，当然更加复杂、困难。她得熟悉从汉口到上海沿途三百多个岸标和浮标的名称，要摸清安全方位，对每个过江航向，岸标和岸标，浮标和浮标之间的距离，航向受风力和水流压的影响等，都要牢牢记住。初学的时候，对长江的地形不熟悉，河底情况不了解，记不清哪里有沙滩、礁石或者沉船。因此，她每天除了值八小时的班以外，其余的休息时间，也尽量利用，一有机会就到驾驶室去学习老驾驶员怎样领航。哪怕冬天括风下雪，她也坚持站在驾驶台前。由于视线不清，越是天气坏，越要把玻璃窗打开。有时雪花在她的棉衣上结成了冰块，脚都冻硬了，她还是一天站八小时，十小时，甚至十二小时，不肯下去。
    那个保守的船长怎么样呢？只要被他碰见了，不是一顿无理的批评，什么“单纯技术观点”之类，就是几句嘲骂：“怎么？你刚下班，又来了？学得太多，不怕涨破肚子？”“你是资本家作风，学了技术好赚大钱。可是，你知道，出了海事，损失名誉的是我们领导！”这个船长对老驾驶员们热心教她，也时常加以讽刺：“收她做干女儿吧！”
    老驾驶员们则表示，一个学生肯学总是好的。有的热情地说：“我年纪大了，难道把技术带到棺材里去？看见下一代青年人掌握了技术，心里真痛快。我们的本领是吃了许多冤枉苦头才学来的，再不能让新社会里的青年也走我们的老路了！”
    老驾驶员们坚持党积极培养和提拔青年的方针，他们主动地把技术教给有志气的女实习生罗烈芳，当他们在驾驶台上操作，看到船长一不在，就时常小声地招呼道：“小罗，来学！”
    就这样，小罗学会了驾驶技术，在1955年春领到了三副执照。
    善于教育后进的李庆江船长再一次地对访问者说，充满了嘉许的心情：“罗烈芳是艰苦奋斗出来的。”
    罗烈芳带着一点羞涩，谦虚地说：“我自己是没有什么，要感谢大伙儿对我的帮助，感谢党的大力培养。不论在什么时候，我总是记起那些帮助过我的人们。我的经验太少了，我决心要继续锻炼自己，钻研技术，不辜负大家对我的期望。”
    “难道你自己真的一点儿也没有什么吗？”访问者这样问。“那也不，应该这样说，一个青年应该依靠组织，依靠群众，依靠自己！”
