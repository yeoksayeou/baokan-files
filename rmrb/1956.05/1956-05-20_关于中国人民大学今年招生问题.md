    Regarding enrollment problems at Renmin University of China this year

    Recently, we have received many letters inquiring about the enrollment issues of Renmin University of China. We now have the university respond as follows:

    Q: What new majors has Renmin University of China added this year? What are the training objectives of these majors?

    A: According to the regulations of the Ministry of Higher Education, in order to meet the needs for political theory teachers and theoretical work in universities and colleges, our university has added history (including specializations in the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism and the history of the Chinese Revolution) and philosophy majors this year. These two majors, along with the existing political economics major, primarily aim to train teachers for theoretical courses in universities and colleges, as well as personnel for scientific research. The three majors will enroll a total of one thousand students this year.

    Q: What is the length of study for each major?

    A: The history and archives major requires four years of study for graduation, the journalism major requires three years, and the political theory, finance and economics, and law majors all require five years.

    Q: Can this year's high school graduates apply?

    A: In the past, our university only enrolled cadres. In addition to enrolling cadres this year, we will also enroll a considerable number of outstanding graduates from this year's senior high schools. At the same time, we hope they will enthusiastically apply for the three political theory majors and strive to be glorious propagandists of Marxism-Leninism and glorious fighters on the theoretical front of Marxism-Leninism.

    Q: Who are the target applicants for the journalism major?

    A: In addition to allocating a portion of the journalism major's enrollment quota to the news system, we will also recruit some on-the-job cadres who have been working in non-news and publishing businesses for more than three years. These students will receive a stipend after being admitted. We will not be recruiting high school graduates this year.

    Q: What matters should be noted during registration?

    A: This year, in order to simplify the registration procedures, we will not implement an application-based registration. Candidates can directly register with our university's enrollment teams in various locations. When registering, candidates should bring a letter of introduction from their respective work units. This year, high school graduates should submit graduation certificates, while on-the-job cadres and demobilized or discharged military personnel do not need to submit educational qualification documents. The candidate's work unit must transfer the candidate's files (including Party and Communist Youth League materials) to our university's enrollment team at the time of registration (do not send them to the university headquarters to avoid delays). Any introductions and recommendations from organizations must be subject to passing the examination before admission.

    Graduates from senior high schools, workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools, and organizations with a large number of candidates can adopt a collective registration method. Within the registration period, they can collect various forms from our university's enrollment team, and then submit them to the enrollment team together with the health examination and the required documents, and receive an "admission ticket."

    Our university's enrollment teams in various locations will start operating around June 10th. Their addresses will be announced in the local newspapers.

    Candidates are responsible for their own food, accommodation, and travel expenses during the examination period.

    Q: Can I apply across provinces?

    A: If our university has an enrollment team in your province, you should generally apply in your own province. If there is an enrollment team in your province but it is far away, you can apply to our university's enrollment team in a neighboring province.

    Q: Can I apply to other schools after applying to Renmin University of China?

    A: Yes.

    Q: What are the requirements for the cultural level of candidates? What should I use to prepare for the exam?

    A: Candidates (including graduates of secondary vocational schools and on-the-job cadres with secondary vocational education) must have a cultural level equivalent to that of a high school graduate or equivalent. However, the requirements for the mathematics exam are slightly lower than those for science and engineering subjects, and only algebra, trigonometry, and plane geometry are tested. History and geography include both Chinese and foreign history and geography. Candidates can prepare according to the requirements of the examination syllabus published by the Ministry of Higher Education this year.

    Q: What are the benefits after admission?

    A: The benefits after admission will be handled according to the regulations of the Ministry of Higher Education (see Guangming Daily on April 18th for details). Students are responsible for their own books and stationery expenses after enrollment; those with genuine financial difficulties can be given appropriate subsidies. A small number of new students who are unable to afford the travel expenses to school due to the long distance can apply for subsidies from the National Unified Enrollment Committee for Institutions of Higher Education in the location of our university's enrollment team with our university's "admission notice" and a letter from their local People's Committee or police station proving their family's financial hardship. On-the-job cadres' travel expenses to school are borne by their original organizations.

    关于中国人民大学今年招生问题
    最近我们收到很多来信，询问中国人民大学招生的一些问题，现请中国人民大学答复如下：
    问：中国人民大学今年新设了那些专业？这些专业的培养目标是什么？
    答：根据高等教育部规定，我校为了满足高等学校政治理论师资和理论工作的需要，今年增设历史学专业（包括马克思列宁主义基础、中国革命史两个专门化）和哲学专业。这两个专业和原有的政治经济学专业，主要是培养高等学校理论课师资和科学研究人材。三个专业今年共招收一千名学生。
    问：各专业学习年限如何？
    答：历史档案专业四年毕业，新闻专业三年毕业，政治理论、财经、法律各专业都是五年毕业。
    问：今年高中毕业学生是否可以投考？
    答：过去我校只招收干部。今年除招收干部外，还要招收相当数量的本届高级中学优秀毕业生。同时希望他们能踊跃地投考三个政治理论专业，争取做一个光荣的马克思列宁主义的宣传员，做一个马克思列宁主义理论战线上的光荣战士。
    问：新闻专业招生对象是哪些人？
    答：新闻专业的招生名额除一部分分配给新闻系统以外，还招收部分非新闻出版业务的参加工作三年以上的在职干部，这部分学生录取入学后按助学金待遇。今年暂不招收高中毕业生。
    问：报名的时候应注意那些事项？
    答：今年为简化报名手续，不实行申请报名，考生可直接向我校各地招生组报名。报名时应携带有关单位的介绍报考的函件。今年高中毕业生交毕业证明书，在职干部、转业、复员军人不交学历证明文件。考生所在单位必须在报名时将考生档案（包括党、团材料）转交我校招生组（不要寄给校部，以免转交费时）。任何机关介绍和保送，必须经过考试合格后才能录取。
    各高级中学、工农速成中学毕业生及考生较多的机关可以采取集体报名的办法，在报名日期内向我校招生组领取各项表格，然后连同健康检查和规定应交的证件一并交招生组，领取“准考证”。
    我校各地招生组将在六月十日左右办公，住址将在当地报纸公布。
    考生在考期的食宿及往返路费等问题，由考生个人解决。
    问：是否可以跨省报考？
    答：如本省内我校设有招生组，一般应在本省报考。若本省虽有招生组但距离较远，可在邻省我校招生组报考。
    问：报考中国人民大学后是否可以报考其他学校？
    答：可以。
    问：对考生的文化水平要求如何？根据什么复习准备？
    答：考生（包括中等专业学校毕业生和在职的中等专业干部在内）必须具有高中毕业或同等学力的文化水平。但是数学的考试要求比理工科略低些，只考代数、三角和平面几何。历史地理包括中外历史地理。考生可根据高等教育部今年出版的考试大纲的要求精神来复习准备。
    问：录取以后的待遇如何？
    答：考生录取入学后的待遇根据高等教育部的规定办理（详见四月十八日光明日报）。入学后书籍和文具费由学生个人负担；经济确实困难者，可以给予适当补助。少数新生因赴校路途过远，无力负担入学路费时，可持我校“入学通知书”和当地区人民委员会或派出所给与的家庭经济困难证明函件，到我校招生组所在地的全国高等学校统一招生委员会申请补助。在职干部入学路费由原机关负担。
