    This year's Shanghai Jing'an Temple Fair, following traditional custom, was held from May 16th to 18th (around the eighth day of the fourth lunar month, the Bathing Buddha Festival).
    The Shanghai Jing'an Temple Fair began in the fourth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty and has a history of over seventy years. During the annual temple fair, handicraftsmen and vendors from all over Shanghai gather near Jing'an Temple Street to sell various handicrafts and Shanghai's famous local specialties.
    This year's temple fair was even better than in previous years. Most of the handicraftsmen and vendors participating in the temple fair were members of cooperatives and cooperative groups, and they brought out more new products than in previous years and demonstrated a good business style. According to incomplete statistics from the temple fair office, this year's goods for sale at the temple fair included more than 200,000 pieces of handicrafts alone, including bamboo and rattan ware, woodenware, hardware, leather goods, general merchandise, clothing, shoes, and socks. Among them, roasted flower bamboo ware, new-style painted cloth boxes, and rotating children's rattan cars were products rarely supplied in the city in the past. The Thirty-sixth Woodware Production Cooperative in Hongkou District sold woodenware this year that was painted with Guang lacquer and raw lacquer, and the materials used were also good. The head of this cooperative said: "In the past, when we were working individually, we would not have sold such good quality goods at the temple fair; now that we are members of the cooperative, we shouldn't be careless in our work."

    今年的上海静安寺庙会
    一年一度的上海市静安寺庙会，按照传统的习惯，今年在五月十六日到十八日（旧历四月初八浴佛节前后三天）举行。
    上海市静安寺庙会是从清朝光绪四年开始的，至今已有七十多年的历史。在每年的庙会期间，上海全市的手工业者和摊贩都要集中到静安寺街道附近，出售各种手工业品和上海著名的土特产。
    今年的庙会比往年更加出色。参加庙会的手工业者和摊贩，大部分是合作社和合作小组的成员，他们拿出了比往年更多的新产品，并且表现了良好的经营作风。据庙会办公室不完全的统计，今年参加庙会出售的商品，仅仅是手工业品就有二十万件以上，有竹藤器、木器、五金、皮革、百货和服装、鞋袜等。其中如烤花竹器、新型油漆布箱以及可以转动的儿童藤车等，都是过去市内很少供应的产品。虹口区第三十六木器生产合作社今年出售的木器，都是用广漆和生漆油漆的，用的材料也不错。这个社的负责人说：“过去我们单干时，在庙会上就不出售这种好货色；现在我们是社员了，干活就不该马虎。”
