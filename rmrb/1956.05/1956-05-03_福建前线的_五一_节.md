On the morning of the first day, the officers and soldiers of various branches of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front excitedly entered their battle positions in the pouring rain to protect the coastal people in celebrating the festival.

Large numbers of coastal sentries patrolled the coast, monitoring the vast sea. Sailors sailed their ships, patrolling the sea day and night. At 2:53 PM, four Chiang Kai-shek military aircraft intruded into the areas of Liu'ao Peninsula and Yongning County in Jinjiang County. Our army's anti-aircraft artillery units immediately countered with fierce fire, forcing the Chiang aircraft to avoid low-altitude flight and quickly flee. Chiang Kai-shek's artillery, entrenched on the islands of Greater and Lesser Kinmen, shelled our areas of Xiamen Island, Dadeng Island, and Lianhe multiple times. However, the troops stationed in the front-line areas and the working people still calmly celebrated their festival amidst the roaring artillery fire.

In between combat and preparations for war, various branches of the armed forces held small-scale celebrations. A certain unit stationed in the Xiamen area held sports competitions, and a certain naval unit held shooting competitions. Troops stationed in the Fuzhou area held get-togethers with local workers and peasants. Officers and soldiers congratulated the workers and peasants on their new achievements in socialist construction. During the festival, many soldiers wrote letters encouraging their families and friends to actively engage in production and contribute to the early completion of the first Five-Year Plan.

    福建前线的“五一”节
    一日拂晓，福建前线中国人民解放军各兵种部队的官兵们，兴奋地冒着大雨进入自己的战斗位置，保卫沿海人民欢度节日。
    大批的海岸哨兵在海岸游动，监视着浩瀚的海面。水兵们驾驶着舰艇，日夜不停地在海上巡逻。下午二时五十三分，四架蒋军飞机窜入六鳌半岛和晋江县永宁地区，我军高射炮部队立刻以猛烈炮火迎击，使蒋机不敢低飞，迅速逃去。盘踞在大、小金门岛上的蒋军炮兵向我厦门岛、大嶝岛、莲河地区炮击多次，但是，前线地区的驻军和劳动人民，仍然沉着地在炮声隆隆中庆祝了自己的节日。
    在战斗和战备的间隙，各兵种部队举行了小型庆祝活动。驻厦门地区的某部举行了体育运动竞赛，某水兵部队举行了射击比赛。驻福州地区的部队与驻地的工人、农民举行了联欢会，官兵们祝贺工人、农民在社会主义建设中取得新的成就。在节日里，许多战士写信鼓励家属和亲友积极生产，为提前完成第一个五年计划而贡献力量。（据新华社讯）
