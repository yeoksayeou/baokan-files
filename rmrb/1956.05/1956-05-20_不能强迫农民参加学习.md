    Cannot Force Peasants to Participate in Learning
    To the Editor:
    In Henan Province, some agricultural production cooperatives use the method of deducting work points to force peasants to study in the people's schools they run. For example, the Luoji Township Agricultural Cooperative in Yu County stipulates that cooperative leaders will have five work points deducted for each absence from study, production team leaders will have three work points deducted for each absence, and ordinary cooperative members will have two work points deducted for each absence. The No. 17 Agricultural Cooperative in Huangtun Township, Yiyang County, also stipulates that members who miss a study session will have two work points deducted.
    The purpose of making such regulations is, of course, to ensure that the study is carried out well, and the motive cannot be said to be bad. However, using this method of deducting work points may force members to participate in learning, but it will never make them consciously and actively study. To do a good job in learning, we must rely on education. Compulsory means can only turn good things into bad things and should be corrected quickly. Zhao Liangwen

### 不能强迫农民参加学习

    不能强迫农民参加学习编辑同志：
    河南省有一些农业生产合作社办的民校，用扣劳动工分的办法来强迫农民学习。像禹县罗集乡农业社规定：社的领导人员在学习的时候有一次不到扣五个劳动工分，生产队长有一次不到扣三个劳动工分，一般社员有一次不到扣两个劳动工分。伊阳县黄屯乡第十七农业社办的民校也规定社员有一次不去学习要扣两个劳动工分。
    作出这种规定的目的，当然是为了保证把学习搞好，动机不能说不好。但是，用这种扣劳动工分的办法，虽然可能使社员们被迫去参加学习，但是决不能使他们自觉地来积极学习。要搞好学习，必须依靠教育工作。强迫手段只能把好事办成坏事，应该迅速纠正。　赵良文
