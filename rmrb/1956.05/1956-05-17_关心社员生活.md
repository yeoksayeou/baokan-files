Caring for Commune Members' Livelihood
Developing Sidelines to Overcome the Spring Famine

Due to crop reduction caused by autumn harvest disasters last year, the Sixth Branch of the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lushan County, Henan Province, is experiencing a spring famine this year. More and more commune members are borrowing money from the cooperative. The cooperative's funds are limited, so it can only lend small amounts to commune members each day. One day, 20 yuan was lent to 18 households. Commune members felt that the small amount of money was not helpful, and the cooperative's staff also felt very embarrassed.

How exactly can we help commune members overcome the spring famine? The cooperative's management committee held a special meeting to study this issue. The committee members carefully calculated the accounts: within three months, the cooperative's two brick kilns could generate at least 700 yuan in net income; the 22 silk weaving machines could earn another 800 yuan by processing silk for the state; organizing transportation could generate 400 yuan; in addition, out of the 1,200 yuan of advance purchase funds for tobacco leaves, 700 yuan could be used to pre-lend to commune members. These items combined would amount to approximately 2,600 yuan in income. Everyone then ranked the commune members' economic situations household by household, and found that 244 households needed to borrow money, requiring approximately 2,400 to 2,500 yuan. With this calculation, everyone had confidence in overcoming the spring famine. Soon, all 18 sideline production groups in the cooperative began various sideline production activities; some commune members engaged in agricultural production also went to transport coal during production gaps. A wave of production to overcome the famine swept through the entire cooperative.

The management committee assessed the loan amounts for each household at once, and paid the money in installments according to the date the state supplied grain. The commune members could buy enough grain with the money, were more secure about production, and the cooperative's staff were spared a lot of trouble.

Caring for Poor Peasants

The "Yong'an" Agricultural Production Cooperative is located in Wenlong Township, Hanshou County, on the banks of Dongting Lake. In previous years, some commune members had to rely on income from selling nets and fishing to supplement their food rations for three to four months, in addition to their agricultural income. After joining the cooperative, commune members had less time to fish and make nets, so their personal income decreased, especially as they currently lacked spare money to buy rice and salt. In addition, some commune members were old, weak, disabled, or had fewer laborers and larger families, and they are also facing difficult living conditions.

Initially, these poor commune members did not receive the care and help of the cooperative cadres; on the contrary, some were even discriminated against. Huang Zixin, a poor peasant commune member from the Fourth Production Brigade, had no rice to cook and ate vegetables for two meals. He asked the deputy brigade leader to help him find a solution, but the reply he received was: "Last year, every household harvested a houseful of grain. Now you are complaining that you have nothing to eat. You are either lazy or stealing." A production team leader even sarcastically said to him: "No wonder you were in the front of the line at the meeting when you joined the cooperative. It turns out you were playing this game."

After this incident, the cooperative's leading staff began to pay attention to the living difficulties of poor peasant commune members. At a meeting of the cooperative's management committee, everyone criticized various views and statements that did not care about the lives of commune members. The management committee also decided to allocate some people to fish and pre-lend the daily income from fishing to poor commune members; at the same time, commune members should be given appropriate time to manage household sidelines. With their living problems resolved, the poor commune members were very enthusiastic about production during rice transplanting.

Needs Overall Planning

In the office of the Central Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhenxi Township, Guichi County, Anhui, no fewer than 50 to 60 commune members come to find the director and accountant every day. This one wants to borrow money to buy a foot of cloth, that one wants to borrow money to buy two ounces of oil, and a third wants to borrow money to buy a few kilograms of rice. The cooperative director is overwhelmed with approving loan slips or writing letters of introduction requesting loans from credit cooperatives. The cooperative director is afraid that commune members will waste money, so he only approves very small amounts of money each time; as a result, he is increasingly bogged down in these tasks of approving slips and writing letters of introduction, leaving aside the matter of leading production, so that crops are not growing well, and commune members are very anxious.

Adopting passive measures to prevent commune members from wasting money is not a good method. The cooperative's management committee should conduct a comprehensive understanding of the commune members' living difficulties, study and formulate a reasonable solution to the commune members' living difficulties, lend more to those who need it, lend less to those who need less, and do not lend to those who do not have living difficulties. In this way, not only can the living difficulties of some commune members be better resolved, but also, the cooperative director can free himself from the passive state of frequently approving slips and devote his energy to leading commune members to increase production and increase income.

    关心社员生活
    发展副业度春荒
    河南省鲁山县红星农业生产合作社第六分社由于去年秋禾受灾减产，今年发生了春荒。向社里借钱的社员越来越多。社里的资金不多，只好零星地每天借一点给社员，有一天二十元钱就分别借给了十八户。社员认为钱少不济事，社的工作人员也感到很为难。
  究竟怎样来帮助社员度过春荒？社管理委员会专门开会研究了这个问题。委员们算了细账：在三个月内，全社现有两个砖瓦窑至少可以净收入七百元；有二十二张织绸机，替国家加工丝绸又可收入八百元；组织运输可以收入四百元；此外有一千二百多元的烟叶预购款，可以抽出七百元来预借给社员。这几项合起来约有二千六百元的收入。大家又把社员的经济情况逐户排了队，全社有二百四十四户需要借钱，大约需要二千四百元至二千五百元。这样一算，大家都有信心度过春荒了。不久，全社十八个副业小组，就分头展开各种副业生产活动；从事农业生产的社员中也有一部分人在生产空隙去运煤。全社掀起了生产度荒的热潮。
    管理委员会把各户的借款数一次评定，按照国家供应粮食的日期分期付钱，社员拿了钱可以买到足够的粮食，生产也安心了，社的工作人员也省了许多麻烦。
    照顾贫农社员
    “永安”农业生产合作社在洞庭湖滨的汉寿县文龙乡，有些社员往年除了农业收入以外，还要靠卖网打鱼的收入来补足三、四个月的口粮。入社以后，社员没有时间去打鱼结网，个人的收入就减少了，特别是目前没有零钱买米买盐。此外，社里还有一些是老弱残病或是劳力少、人口多的社员，目前的生活也很困难。
    起初，这些贫困社员并没有得到社干部的关心和帮助，相反地，有的还受到歧视。第四生产大队的贫农社员黄自新，无米下锅，吃了两顿菜，要求副大队长替他想办法，可是得到的答复却是：“去年哪家都收了一屋子谷，你如今就喊无饭吃，不是懒汉也是偷懒。”有个生产组长还讽刺他：“难怪你入社的时候开会跑在前面，原来下的是这着棋。”
    这件事情发生以后，社里的领导工作人员才开始关心贫农社员的生活困难问题。在一次社务管理委员会上，大家批判了各种不关心社员生活的看法和说法。管理委员会还决定抽出一部分人去打鱼，把每天打鱼的收入预借给贫困社员；同时要让社员有适当的经营家庭副业的时间。生活问题解决了，贫困社员在插秧中生产劲头很高。
    需要通盘筹划
    在安徽贵池县珍溪乡中心农业生产合作社的办公室里，每天来找主任和会计的社员不下五、六十人，这个要借钱买一尺布，那个要借钱称二两油，第三个又要借钱买几斤米。社主任为批借款条子或开请求信用合作社贷款的介绍信忙得不可开交。社主任怕社员浪费，每次只批借很少一点钱；这样，他就越来越为这些批条子、开介绍信的事务拖住了，把领导生产的事丢在一边，以致庄稼长得不好，社员们都很着急。
    采用消极的办法防止社员浪费，并不是好办法。合作社管理委员会应该对社员的生活困难情况进行全面的了解，通盘研究并制定一个解决社员生活困难的合理办法，该多借的多借，该少借的少借，生活上不困难的不借。这样，不但可以更好地解决部分社员的生活困难，而且，社主任也可以从频繁地批条子的被动状态中摆脱出来，腾出精力去领导社员增加生产，增加收入。
