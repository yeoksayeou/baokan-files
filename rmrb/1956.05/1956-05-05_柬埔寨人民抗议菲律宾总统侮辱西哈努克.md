Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 4th: According to an Agence France-Presse report from Phnom Penh: Approximately 15,000 people in the Cambodian capital held a demonstration in front of the National Assembly building on May 4th to protest Philippine President Magsaysay's "serious insult" to former Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Sihanouk.

It is reported that a similar demonstration was also held in Kampong Cham, northeast of Phnom Penh, on May 3rd.

Sihanouk revealed on April 25th that the Philippine government had brutally forced Cambodia to abandon its neutral policy during his visit to the Philippines. Philippine President Magsaysay then issued a statement denying the matter and attacking Sihanouk, saying that "Prince Sihanouk's remarks in this regard are hypocritical and ridiculous."

　　柬埔寨人民抗议菲律宾总统侮辱西哈努克
    新华社河内4日电　据法新社金边消息：柬埔寨首都人民约一万人五月四日在国民会议大厦前面举行示威，抗议菲律宾总统麦格赛赛对柬埔寨前首相西哈努克亲王的“严重侮辱”。
    据悉，金边东北的磅湛也在五月三日举行了同样的示威。
    西哈努克曾经在四月二十五日揭露出菲律宾政府在他访问菲律宾期间粗暴地迫使柬埔寨放弃中立政策的事实。菲律宾总统麦格赛赛随即发表谈话，否认这件事，并且攻击西哈努克说“西哈努克亲王在这方面的谈话是虚伪和可笑的。”
