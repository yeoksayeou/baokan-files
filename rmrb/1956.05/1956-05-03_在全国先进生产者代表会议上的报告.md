Comrades:

　　Following the high tide of the socialist revolution, a high tide of socialist construction has also been set off in our country. It is in this situation that we are holding the National Conference of Advanced Producers Representatives. It is fully expected that through this conference, workers across the country will be more widely mobilized to carry out the advanced producer movement persistently, so that the socialist construction cause can move forward by leaps and bounds. The workers across the country will use such practical actions and practical achievements in the socialist construction cause to welcome the upcoming 8th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.

　　At this conference, Comrade Li Fuchun delivered the opening speech, and Comrade Liu Shaoqi delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, giving us extremely valuable instructions. The main purpose of my report today is to talk about how to carry out the advanced producer movement persistently. The report is divided into the following five parts:

　　I. The Labor Enthusiasm and Creativity of All Workers are the Primary Guarantee for Building Socialism

　　To build our country into a great socialist country is the goal of our people nationwide. In order to achieve this goal, we are carrying out industrial construction focusing on the development of heavy industry, and realizing socialist industrialization in a planned and step-by-step manner; we are realizing the cooperation of agriculture and handicrafts, and will gradually achieve the mechanization of agriculture, in order to greatly improve agricultural production in our country; most capitalist industry and commerce have already been jointly operated by public and private interests, and have been transformed into state capitalist enterprises. In about three years, they can be transformed into socialist enterprises; we are also changing the backward state of our culture, and strive to make our country's scientific and technological level in some important aspects close to or catch up with the world's advanced level in twelve years. Chairman Mao Zedong said: "We are doing an extremely glorious and great cause that our predecessors have never done before." Yes, our cause is incomparably great and exceptionally arduous at the same time.

　　Our plan to build socialism in our country is a grand plan, and this plan has no precedent in our country's history. Just take the output of steel as an example: the annual output in 1955 was 2.85 million tons, an increase of 111% compared with 1952; according to the outline of the national plan, we will strive to increase it to five times that of 1955 in 1962; and in 1967 - when the third five-year plan is completed, it will be ten times that of 1955. Many products that we could not manufacture ourselves in the past will also be produced in batches. Our skies will soar with our self-made airplanes, our fields will roar with our self-made tractors, and our roads will gallop with our self-made cars. What an encouraging thing this is!

　　Can such a grand plan be realized? We can say with certainty: it can. The history since liberation can fully convince people of this possibility.

　　Everyone knows that in the short three years after liberation, we restored the national economy that had been severely damaged by the war to the pre-war level. In those years, we were even fighting the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea while restoring the national economy. Of course, there were many difficulties, but these difficulties were overcome by us one by one. We achieved victory.

　　Regarding the first five-year plan, even three years ago, some people thought it could not be realized. But now we have all seen that the tasks set for the first three years of the first five-year plan have been completed and overfulfilled. Taking the situation of state-owned, cooperative-operated, and jointly operated by public and private industrial enterprises in completing the total output value plan, it was 107% in 1953, 106% in 1954, and preliminarily calculated to be 108% in 1955. Today, not long after the start of the fourth year of the Five-Year Plan, we have already heard news of many industrial and mining enterprises completing the first five-year plan ahead of schedule. As for groups and individuals who have completed the first five-year plan tasks ahead of schedule, there are even more.

　　Based on the achievements and experiences already made in the past few years, coupled with the favorable situation that our country has achieved a decisive victory in socialist transformation since the second half of last year, the speed of industrial construction in our country has accelerated and the scale has expanded. Now, the number of key construction projects in our country has increased from 694 when the first five-year plan was announced to 800. Many large-scale factories with high production efficiency and manufacturing new products have been established, or are about to be established. Some of the original enterprises in our country have undergone technological transformation, and some are undergoing technological transformation. The production efficiency of these enterprises is also rapidly increasing. Our country's industry, agriculture, transportation, and construction in all aspects are developing rapidly.

　　Facts are the most convincing. We can fully believe that our country's first five-year plan will be completed and overfulfilled ahead of schedule. At the same time, we have a stronger confidence to complete the second and third five-year plans.

　　What is the force that enables us to make the achievements we have already made and guarantees that we will definitely achieve victory in the cause of socialist construction? This force is the Chinese working class and all the people under the leadership of their glorious vanguard - the Communist Party of China; this force is the solid alliance of the working class, peasants, and intellectuals under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. This force, coupled with the brotherly help of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries to us, and the support of the people all over the world, is invincible. It guarantees the inevitable victory of our great socialist construction cause. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, with the brotherly assistance of the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, the peaceful labor of the people of our country has created great achievements. There is no doubt that people all over the world will see us make greater achievements.

　　To build socialism, we must greatly improve our productive forces and greatly improve our labor productivity. To improve productivity and labor productivity, we must rely on increasingly perfect technical equipment and reasonable production and labor organization. However, technical equipment - machines and tools - are created and mastered by people; production organization and labor organization are the combination of people, and are constantly improved based on people's labor experience. Therefore, people are the decisive factor in production. People's attitude towards labor largely determines the speed of production development.

　　Now, in our country's state-owned enterprises and cooperative enterprises, there is no exploitation. Now, the vast majority of private enterprises have been jointly operated by public and private interests, and have been changed into state capitalist enterprises. In the remaining small number of private enterprises, exploitation has also been greatly restricted. In a short period of time, except for individual regions, all jointly operated by public and private interests and private enterprises will be transformed into socialist enterprises without any exploitation. The working class in our country is building its own country and building its own happy life. In our country, the interests of the state and the interests of the people are consistent.

　　Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, with the development of our country's construction cause, the working conditions and living conditions of workers in our country have undergone major changes. In the past few years, the number of employed people in our country has increased greatly every year, and the ranks of the working class have been rapidly expanding; the current wages of workers in our country have increased compared to 1952. Not long ago, the State Council convened a wage conference and decided to carry out a reform of the wage system in our country this year on the basis of increasing wages. In terms of wage growth, we will also reach the 1957 level ahead of schedule. In the past few years, the working conditions of workers in our country have been greatly improved. For example, the workers in the coal industry, their working conditions were extremely bad before liberation, but now, they have greatly reduced heavy physical labor. Now, more than 45% of the coal in state-owned coal industry is mined by combined coal mining machines, coal cutting machines or pneumatic picks, and the remaining 50% of the coal is drilled with electric drills or pneumatic drills, and then blasted. More than 80% of the transportation work on underground working faces and level roadways has been mechanized. Underground, many ventilators have replaced the original natural ventilation, and underground workers can get three cubic meters of fresh air per minute. By 1955, 5.7 million workers in our country enjoyed labor insurance, and the insurance expenses paid by the state and enterprises reached 505 million yuan, which is equivalent to 12.39% of the total wages of all workers enjoying insurance benefits. In the next year or two, the scope and number of labor insurance will be expanded, and the vast majority of workers in our country will be able to enjoy labor insurance.

　　In the past few years, many workers' sanatoriums have been established in many scenic areas; in our enterprises, amateur sanatoriums have been established relatively universally, and batches of workers have been able to go to good environments for treatment and rest. In the past few years, our country and enterprises have allocated large sums of money to improve workers' living conditions and cultural life conditions. Now, new workers' residential areas have appeared near industrial and mining areas, and many cultural palaces, clubs and sports fields have been established in industrial and mining areas and large enterprises. These are things that our workers have never had in the past.

　　Socialism is to continuously meet the growing needs of people on the premise of continuously improving labor productivity and continuously developing production. The workers in our country have fully and clearly seen the beauty of socialism from their actual life experiences in the past few years, so many workers said: "Hearing about socialism, my heart blooms and my whole body is full of energy." To build our own country, build our own life, and build socialist labor is the conscious labor of the working class. The new labor attitude of workers in our country is generated on this basis, and is increasingly consolidated and developed.

　　The workers in our country regard production as their own business, and the broad masses of workers are deeply concerned about the development of production, and are never satisfied with the production level that has been achieved. They are improving machines and tools every day, improving production organization and labor organization; they use every minute of working hours to give play to the role of every machine tool and every piece of production area, to increase the quantity of products, increase the variety of products, improve the quality of products, and reduce the cost of products. All these make our country's labor productivity grow rapidly.

　　The high enthusiasm for building socialism makes people generate a strong will to overcome all difficulties. Comrades may already know the deeds of Comrade Li Laicai. He lost both feet in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. Under normal circumstances, he not only cannot work, but also needs someone to take care of him. However, what Comrade Li Laicai has been thinking about is to participate in the great construction cause of the motherland. After several years of hard struggle, he finally made himself an excellent tractor driver, and was included in the ranks of advanced producers with his own achievements in production. Our workers across the country are also overcoming all difficulties with a strong will and unparalleled heroic spirit in their respective positions. This heroic spirit of building socialism makes "high mountains bow to us, and rivers give way to us."

　　In our country, people love their jobs. In addition to "answering all questions without getting bored, and choosing all items without getting tired," our commercial workers also take the initiative to find ways to meet the needs of customers; our postal workers strive to improve efficiency while trying to eliminate errors, and make a large number of letters with unknown addresses find their owners; our cooks make people eat "fragrant, hot, clean and cheap" meals... Since these jobs are all to serve the people, our broad masses of workers do these jobs wholeheartedly.

　　The labor enthusiasm and creativity of the working class in our country are concentratedly manifested in the socialist competition. After liberation, with the fundamental change in the political status and improvement of life of the working class, the socialist competition was quickly launched in many places across the country. Now, it is being carried out on an unprecedentedly broad scale throughout the country. In enterprises, not only production workers participated in the competition, but also large numbers of engineering and technical personnel, staff, auxiliary workers, and personnel of affiliated units also participated in the competition. The broad masses of scientific workers, educational workers, literary and art workers, medical workers, and government workers are also active in the high tide of socialist construction. They voluntarily undertook tasks that seemed very arduous, and completed these tasks excellently, creating many deeds worth praising.

　　In the current socialist competition, a large number of advanced producers, advanced workers, and advanced units have emerged. These advanced figures and advanced units are all models of creatively breaking production quotas, creating new records, and using national wealth economically. According to statistics before March this year, more than 50,000 advanced producers emerged in Shanghai; 20,525 advanced producers emerged in Beijing; 21,128 advanced producers emerged in Jiangsu Province; more than 12,000 advanced producers emerged in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region; 3,877 advanced producers emerged in Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province; 9,463 advanced producers emerged in Tangshan City, Hebei Province; 36,448 advanced producers and 2,448 advanced units emerged in ten cities including Shenyang, Liaoning Province, and more than 60,000 workers broke various quotas; more than 90% of train drivers in the national railway system broke transportation quotas. These advanced producers put forward a large number of rationalization proposals and created many advanced experiences, which played a significant role in production. Under the leadership of advanced producers in various industrial sectors and regions, and through the efforts of all workers, the total output value plan of more than 3,000 key enterprises of state-owned, local state-owned, and jointly operated by public and private interests in the first quarter of 1956 was completed by 105%.

　　There are countless difficulties lying across our road to building socialism. We must fully estimate these actually existing difficulties. However, the Chinese working class under the leadership and education of the Communist Party of China will inevitably use its strong optimistic revolutionary spirit, responsible spirit towards the construction cause, and infinite wisdom to overcome all difficulties. The enthusiasm and creativity of the working class are the inexhaustible source of power for us to build socialism, and are the primary guarantee for us to build socialism.

　　II. Our Policy is "More, Faster, Better, and More Economical"

　　The direct purpose of all our work is to overfulfill the socialist construction plan. In order to achieve this goal, all our work must be carried out in accordance with the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" instructed by the Party Central Committee. Following this policy instructed by the Party Central Committee, we can tap the huge potential power in our country's construction and accelerate the speed of socialist construction. On the contrary, if we violate this policy, it will cause a great waste of manpower, materials, and financial resources, and delay the speed of our construction.

　　"More, faster, better, and more economical" is the requirement put forward by the Party and the people of the whole country for the needs of socialist construction for all aspects of work, first of all for production factories and mines and basic construction units. This requires production factories and mines and basic construction units to produce more and faster on the premise of good and economical, and to comprehensively overfulfill various technical and economic indicators. While achieving "more and faster," we must pay attention to "better and more economical"; while achieving "better and more economical," we must pay attention to "more and faster." Neglecting any aspect will cause losses to socialist construction.

　　"You can't have a horse run fast and not eat grass," but "more, faster, better, and more economical" is a reasonable requirement, because it requires the horse feeder not to waste forage, but to feed the fastest and strongest horse, which is completely achievable. The number of employees, products, process, equipment and scale of the three bicycle factories in Tianjin, Shanghai and Shenyang under the First Ministry of Machinery Industry are similar (of which the Shenyang factory has better equipment than the other two factories after the renovation), but the production results of these three factories are different. The planned output of Shenyang factory in 1955 was only equal to 44.8% of the planned output of Tianjin factory and 41.4% of Shanghai factory; the labor productivity of Shenyang factory in the first quarter of 1955 was 53.8% lower than that of Tianjin factory and 52.2% lower than that of Shanghai factory; Shenyang factory once returned more than 10,000 bicycles in the first quarter of last year due to poor product quality, and almost closed the factory. Why is Shenyang factory backward? The real reason is poor management and lack of attention to strengthening mass work. Later, the three factories organized an inter-factory competition. In the competition, although the Shenyang factory was still behind, there was outstanding progress in quality. From August last year, it was also able to complete the national plan on a monthly basis and reduce costs month by month. It can be clearly seen from the example of Shenyang Bicycle Factory that as long as the factories and mines that are temporarily behind make efforts, they can catch up with the advanced level, and they can achieve "more, faster, better, and more economical." The deeds of many comrades sitting here also show that the work of every worker can also achieve "more, faster, better, and more economical." Cao Yongkang, a planer in the first metal workshop of Shanghai State-owned Second Textile Machinery Factory, did six years, eight months and fifteen days of work in three years without producing a single defective product. Wang Xinnian, a turner at the State-owned Shijiazhuang Freight Car Repair Factory, completed the personal workload during the first five-year plan period ahead of schedule on December 16, 1955, creating more than 20,032 wheels for the country, which can install more than 2,500 freight cars, and the quality is all qualified. There are many, many such examples.

　　At present, what deserves our special attention is that the quality of our products is generally not high, and the quality of some products is very unsatisfactory. We must change this situation and strive to improve the quality of products.

　　Improving product quality is of great significance for developing production and improving people's lives. As comrades all know, the products of our heavy industry factories are to supply heavy industry itself and light industry, agriculture, and transportation with technical equipment. If we only pay attention to "more" and "faster" in production and not to "better," and thus the quality is not up to standard, causing rework and scrapping, it will not only prevent ourselves from truly achieving "more," "faster," and "economical," but also hinder the departments that use this equipment from achieving more, faster, better, and more economical. The products of our light industry factories are used to meet the needs of people's lives. The living standards of the people in our country are rapidly improving, and what the people need are products of excellent quality. Girls in ethnic minority areas of Xinjiang wrote letters to textile factories in Shanghai, asking them to "produce more and better floral fabrics as beautiful as clouds in the sky, so that we can all dress up beautifully to participate in dancing on the grassland." This requirement should be met. High-quality products are durable and can fully exert their effectiveness, which is the greatest saving in itself. It should also be seen that constantly raising the requirements for product quality can also promote the continuous improvement of the technical level of industrial production in our country.

　　Improving product quality and work quality is to seriously treat one's own work, is to be responsible for the cause of socialist construction, and is to be responsible to the people.

　　We must also pay special attention to strengthening the trial production of new products. While carrying out social reform, our country is also carrying out technological reform. In the process of technological reform, both industry and agriculture require us to manufacture many new products that our country could not manufacture in the past. Moreover, with the development of the socialist construction cause, the requirements for new products will become more and more numerous and more and more urgent. In the past few years, the increase in the variety of products in our country has been rapid. By the end of last year, the machinery industry had successfully trial-produced more than 2,500 new products. The ferrous and non-ferrous metal industries successfully trial-produced more than 220 new products in 1954 alone. The light industry has increased a total of 2,748 new products in the past three years. Many products that our country had never manufactured in the past are now being produced in batches. However, the trial production of new products is far from keeping up with the needs of industrial construction and agricultural construction, so we must accelerate the expansion of the number of new products and improve the quality of new products. This is a major work to lay the foundation for the technological transformation of our national economy.

　　Of course, we must also practice economy, that is, strive to achieve "saving." Only by practicing economy can we guarantee the accumulation of construction funds; if we do not pay attention to economy, we will waste a lot of national funds and weaken our construction strength. In order to reduce product costs and save national funds, the method of economic accounting of work teams is worth promoting.

　　In the foreseeable future, our country must mainly rely on existing enterprises to supply the products needed by all aspects. For example, during the first five-year plan period, the output value of existing industrial enterprises accounted for about 70% of the total industrial output value. Therefore, our greatest saving is to give full play to the equipment capacity of existing enterprises and tap the potential of these enterprises to serve socialist construction.

　　To achieve "more, faster, better, and more economical," especially to improve quality and trial-produce more new products, first, we must improve the technical level and strengthen technical management; second, we must strengthen labor discipline, especially technical discipline; third, we must strengthen labor protection and create the necessary good conditions for workers' labor.

　　Now, we have many new records in increasing product quantity, improving product quality, reducing product costs, and trial-producing new products. The most important thing at present is to consolidate these records and expand their economic effects. The new records show that we can reach a higher level of production under the existing conditions, and also show the specific path to reach this level. This path is to promote the experience of advanced producers. Because the economic effects of new records can be fully manifested only when most people reach this level of production.

　　By promoting the experience of Kolesnikov, an excellent steelworker in the Soviet Union, Angang (Anshan Iron and Steel) alone increased the production of more than 8,400 tons of steel ingots for the country in one month last October. If all steelworkers master this advanced experience, they can increase the production of hundreds of thousands of tons of steel ingots for the country this year.

　　By promoting Li Chuanjiang's oil pressing method and other advanced experiences in oil pressing, the oil industry increased the production of 260 million jin of vegetable oil for the country last year.

　　By promoting Ai Zhaochang's experience in saving gasoline, the road transportation system reversed the situation of losing oil in the first half of last year and also saved more than 2 million liters of gasoline in the fourth quarter of last year.

　　These are just a few of the thousands of examples, but they can fully illustrate how huge the economic significance of promoting advanced experience is.

　　Of course, to promote advanced experience, a lot of work needs to be done. Promoting advanced experience is a very meticulous organizational work, and it cannot be done by simply holding a conference and calling for it. After promoting advanced experience, new weak links will inevitably appear. Enterprise management must adapt to the new situation and take a series of technical and organizational measures, especially to do a good job in technical supply, and supply drawings, tools, cutters, raw materials, and materials in a timely manner to ensure that advanced experience can be promoted. Some enterprises have gained good experience in this regard, but many enterprises have not done well enough.

　　At the same time, we should also realize that promoting advanced experience is also the business of all our workers. Here, I would like to talk about the principles of socialist competition. Only by earnestly implementing the principles of socialist competition can advanced experience be quickly promoted to the broad masses.

　　What are the fundamental principles of socialist competition? In summary, it is: "Learn from each other, help each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for one's weaknesses, and improve together."

　　Socialist competition requires advanced producers to enthusiastically and patiently help other workers who are temporarily lagging behind in production. The reason is very clear: to comprehensively overfulfill the national plan, it is far from enough for only a few people to be advanced. Most people must reach the advanced level. A thing that Comrade Zhan Shuijing of Dalian Shipyard personally experienced can powerfully illustrate this truth. Zhan Shuijing is an excellent old lathe worker. After liberation, he played a highly responsible spirit in production, worked diligently and conscientiously, and has not produced a single defective product in eight years. Moreover, he has overfulfilled the national plan every month. Now he has overfulfilled the personal workload of the first five-year plan and is already doing the work of 1958. But the group he belongs to is not advanced. It failed to complete the national plan for eight consecutive months last year, and often produced defective products. This fully shows that it is not very useful to be advanced by one person alone. Later, Comrade Zhan Shuijing took active measures to help others, mobilized each master worker in the group to bring a young worker, and he himself also brought two young workers. As a result, the situation was quickly reversed. In January and February this year, their group overfulfilled the national plan and eliminated defective products. This fully shows how much benefit it brings to production when advanced producers promote the communist spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation.

　　Generally speaking, no one is willing to lag behind. In the recent three or four months, it has become more and more obvious that the broad masses are enthusiastically learning advanced experience. The problem is whether we patiently help them. We must never treat those comrades who are temporarily lagging behind in production with a fixed point of view. Some comrades have adopted a non-comradely discriminatory attitude towards comrades who are temporarily lagging behind. They do not specifically analyze the reasons for lagging behind, nor do they specifically help them, but casually put a "backward" label on them, and even satirize them as "old backward," "old stubborn," and "defective product king." Now countless facts have told us that as long as we enthusiastically care for them and patiently help them, many comrades who were so-called backward in the past can completely become advanced producers.

　　Here, we want to focus on criticizing the idea of "survival of the fittest." Some people want to win "superiority" for themselves, so they hope that others will "inferiorly defeat." They are unwilling to tell others their advanced experience, fearing that if others progress, their own advancement will not be obvious. This is entirely a lingering poison of capitalist ideology at work. In capitalist society, in order to win, capitalists always try to squeeze out others. But in our society, the relationship between people has undergone fundamental changes. Everyone is working for a common purpose. Only when the entire society moves forward can individuals build a happy life. Being advanced oneself and helping others to be advanced will not only not lose honor, but on the contrary, will be more loved by the broad masses.

　　On the other hand, we must also see that advanced producers are not necessarily advanced everywhere. A person's wisdom is limited after all, and a person's experience cannot be complete. The broad masses have endless wisdom and talent. Only in mutual learning and mutual assistance can we learn from others' strengths and make up for our weaknesses. The reason why advanced producers are advanced is the result of constantly learning from the broad masses. Advanced experience can only be more perfect when the broad masses complement each other. In the competition among the three bicycle factories mentioned earlier, Shenyang factory was originally the most backward, but Tianjin and Shanghai factories also learned a lot of advanced experience from Shenyang factory, and these advanced experiences were precisely the shortcomings of Tianjin and Shanghai factories. If an advanced producer or an advanced factory thinks that they are stronger than others in everything and become arrogant and complacent, they will fall from the advanced position. We should always remember that each of us is just a member of the masses, and we cannot be separated from the masses. Whoever wants to isolate themselves from the masses is like a fish jumping out of the water. The result can only be dried fish in the sun.

　　Therefore, if we want to constantly advance and seek advancement on the basis of advancement, we must constantly carry out criticism and self-criticism. The process of mutual learning and mutual assistance is also the process of criticism and self-criticism. We should not only pay attention to encouraging (which is of course necessary) but also not to criticism for advanced figures and advanced units. Some comrades do not understand this point and often idolize advanced producers. If there are shortcomings, they dare not criticize, and when the masses criticize, they also say "keep it down, don't knock down this banner." In fact, this is not protecting this banner, but helping to knock down this banner.

　　In terms of mutual learning, mutual assistance, learning from each other's strengths and making up for one's weaknesses, and improving together, the cooperation between engineering and technical personnel and production workers plays a significant role. Production workers have many years of practical experience in labor, which is what general engineering and technical personnel lack, while engineering and technical personnel have systematic scientific and theoretical knowledge, which is what production workers lack. Learning from each other's strengths and making up for each other's weaknesses just combines the scientific and technological theories of engineering and technical personnel with the labor experience of production workers. In this regard, engineering and technical personnel need to give full play to their initiative, often go deep into production workers to study their operating characteristics, and discover and summarize their advanced experience in a timely manner. Whoever does this will achieve significant results. Recently, many major innovation deeds are the result of the cooperation between engineering and technical personnel and production workers. The cooperation between Zhou Guangrui, a technician at Fushun Coal Mine, and Pang Guanxiang, a coal mining worker, to improve coal mining methods and labor organization, which increased work efficiency by two times, is a good proof.

　　In addition, we should also pay attention to labor cooperation within and between enterprises. In modern production, all aspects need to closely cooperate. Fast steelmaking is not only the business of steelworkers, but also the business of ingot casting workers and crane workers. If steelworkers shorten working hours, but other processes cannot keep up, it is still impossible to produce more steel, and even the performance of steel will change. Therefore, the principle of mutual assistance and cooperation in competition should be implemented in all aspects. Classes and groups should cooperate with each other, upper and lower processes should cooperate with each other, functional departments and production workshops should cooperate with each other, and factories and companies should also closely cooperate with each other. We must work as harmoniously as an orchestra and play the majestic song of marching towards socialism.

　　IV. The Working Class in Our Country Must Become a Class with a High Level of Culture and Able to Master Modern Science and Technology

　　The working class in our country is a class that has been tested for a long time under the leadership and education of the Communist Party of China and has a high degree of awareness and organization. However, in terms of science and cultural and technical level, it must be admitted that we are still very backward. This backwardness in science and cultural technology is a serious weakness of the working class in our country. In order to accelerate the socialist construction in our country, it is necessary to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class in our country. At the same time, we must learn from the advanced science of the Soviet Union; learn from the advanced science of all countries in the world, to overcome this serious weakness.

　　The cause of socialist construction in our country is developing rapidly. Many newly built and expanded enterprises are being put into production one after another. Many old enterprises are undergoing technological transformation. More and more modern scientific and technological achievements will be adopted in the production of our country. Only by greatly improving our cultural level and scientific and technological level can we master these new technologies and meet the massive needs of the entire construction cause for engineering and technical personnel and skilled workers. Every worker and every advanced producer in our country can make greater achievements in production only when they improve their culture and master technology. Yu Deshui, an old technician at Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, only knew one operating method of universal milling machine in the past. After participating in two and a half years of cultural study, he can not only fully operate universal milling machine, but also help three apprentices improve to the level of technicians. Many surveyors in the first surveying team of the third branch of the Highway Administration Design Bureau are peasants who have just come out of the countryside. They do not recognize the pile number and made many mistakes. However, after more than a year of cultural study, all of them have eliminated illiteracy. Now they can not only write letters, write reports, and read newspapers and magazines, but also draw cross-sectional views and calculate the amount of earthwork. Some of them can also serve as junior technicians for topographic surveying and leveling.

　　The low level of culture and technology of the working class is related to the backward state of the entire science and technology in our country. The current world has begun to enter the atomic energy era, and many new sciences are developing rapidly. The Soviet Union established the world's first atomic energy power station in 1954; the application of radioactive isotopes in various research works such as chemistry, biology, medicine, agronomy, metallurgy, and mechanics promoted the development of production and various undertakings; in terms of steel smelting, the Soviet Union is recently designing large-scale open hearth furnaces of 450 to 500 tons and large-scale iron smelting blast furnaces of 1,500 cubic meters, but our level is still far from the level of these achievements. The rapid development of industry in our country has put forward a large number of requirements to the scientific community: we want to build several new iron and steel bases, from geology, mining, smelting to the treatment and utilization of slag, all need a lot of scientific research work; the exploration of petroleum resources, the rational utilization of coal, the design and technological transformation of machinery manufacturing, the research and trial production of chemical products, the synthesis of synthetic rubber, the creation of agricultural machinery suitable for our country's land and crops, etc., all need the efforts of scientific workers. The Party Central Committee called on scientific workers to make China's science reach the world's advanced level in the shortest possible time, and our government has also taken many concrete measures to realize this great call. The people all over the country are looking forward to the achievements of scientists. It is fully certain that our scientists will never let down the Party's call and the people's expectations. In the near future, "we will appear in the world as a nation with a high level of culture."

　　在全国先进生产者代表会议上的报告
　　赖若愚
　　同志们：
    紧接着社会主义革命的高潮，我国的社会主义建设也掀起了高潮。就在这样的形势之下，我们来开全国先进生产者代表会议。完全可以预料，通过这次会议，全国职工必将更广泛地动员起来，把先进生产者运动持久地开展下去，使社会主义建设事业大踏步地前进。全国职工将以这样的实际行动和社会主义建设事业中的实际成就来迎接快要召开的中国共产党第八次全国代表大会。
    在这次会议上，李富春同志致了开幕词，刘少奇同志代表中共中央致了祝词，给了我们极其宝贵的指示。我今天的报告，主要是讲一讲如何把先进生产者运动持久地开展下去。报告分作以下五个部分：
    一、全体职工的劳动积极性和创造性是建设社会主义的首要保证
    把我们的国家建设成为伟大的社会主义国家，这是我们全国人民的奋斗目标。为要达到这个目标，我们正在进行着以发展重工业为主的工业建设，有计划、有步骤地实现着社会主义工业化；我们正在实现着农业和手工业的合作化，并且将要逐步地做到农业的机械化，以便大大地提高我国的农业生产；大部分资本主义工商业已经公私合营，被改造成为国家资本主义企业，大约再有三年左右的时间，就可以改造成为社会主义企业；我们也正在改变着我国文化落后的状态，争取在十二年的时间里，使我国的科学技术水平在某些重要方面接近或者赶上世界的先进水平。毛泽东主席说：“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业”。是的，我们的事业是无比伟大的，同时也是异常艰巨的。
    我国建设社会主义的计划是一个宏伟的计划，这个计划在我国历史上是没有前例的。仅就钢的产量来说：1955年的年产量是285万吨，比1952年增长111％；按照国家计划的轮廓，我们将争取在1962年提高到1955年的五倍；而1967年——第三个五年计划完成的时候，提高到1955年的十倍。许多我们过去不能自己制造的产品，也将要成批地生产出来。我们的天空上将要翱翔着我们自制的飞机，我们的田野上将要轰鸣着我们自制的拖拉机，我们的公路上将要奔驰着我们自制的汽车，这是多么令人鼓舞的事情啊！
    这样宏伟的计划能不能实现呢？我们可以肯定地说：能够。解放以来的历史完全可以使人信服地证明这种可能性。
    谁都知道，我们在解放以后短短的三年中，就把经过严重的战争破坏的国民经济恢复到战前水平。在那些年月里，我们甚至是一面进行抗美援朝的斗争，一面进行国民经济的恢复工作，当然困难是很多的，可是这些困难都被我们一个一个地克服了。我们取得了胜利。
    对于第一个五年计划，甚至在三年以前还有人认为是不能够实现的。可是现在我们都已经看到，第一个五年计划所订的前三年的任务已经完成而且超额完成了。以国营、合作社营及公私合营工业完成总产值计划的情况来说，1953年是107％，1954年是106％，1955年初步计算是108％。在五年计划的第四年开始不久的今天，我们就已经听到很多工矿企业提前完成了第一个五年计划的消息，至于提前完成了第一个五年计划任务的小组和个人就更多了。
    在过去几年来已经取得的成就和经验的基础上，加上去年后半年以来我国在社会主义改造方面已经取得决定性的胜利这个有利的形势，我国工业建设的速度加快了，规模扩大了。现在，我国工业建设的重点工程的数目已经从公布第一个五年计划时的694项增加到800项，许多规模巨大的、生产效能高的、制造新产品的大工厂已经建立起来，或者就要建立起来。我国的原有企业，有的经过了技术改造，有的正在进行技术改造，这些企业的生产效能也正在迅速提高。我国的工业、农业、交通运输业和各方面的建设事业都正在一日千里地发展着。
    事实是最有说服力的，我们完全可以确信，我国的第一个五年计划一定会提前完成和超额完成。同时，我们有着更加坚强的信心来完成第二个、第三个五年计划。
    究竟是什么力量使我们做出已有的成就，并且保证我们在社会主义建设事业中一定能够取得胜利呢？这个力量就是在自己的光荣的先锋队——中国共产党领导下的中国工人阶级和全体人民；这个力量就是中国共产党领导下的工人阶级、农民和知识分子的巩固联盟。这个力量加上苏联和其他人民民主国家对我们的兄弟般的帮助，加上全世界人民对我们的支持，它就是无敌的，它保证了我们伟大的社会主义建设事业的必然胜利。在中国共产党的领导下，在苏联和人民民主国家的兄弟援助下，我国人民的和平劳动已经创造出伟大成就，毫无疑问，全世界的人们将会看到我们做出更大的成就。
    要建成社会主义，就必须把我们的生产力大大地提高，把我们的劳动生产率大大地提高。要提高生产力和劳动生产率，就要依靠愈来愈完善的技术装备和合理的生产组织与劳动组织。但是，技术装备——机器和工具是由人来创造和掌握的；生产组织和劳动组织是人的结合，并且是根据人们的劳动经验来不断地改进的。所以，人是生产中的决定的因素。人们对待劳动的态度，在很大的程度上决定着生产发展的速度。
    现在，在我国的国营企业和合作社企业中，是没有剥削的。现在，绝大部分的私营企业已经公私合营，被改变成为国家资本主义企业。在剩下的为数很少的私营企业里，也已经大大地限制了剥削。在不长的时期内，除了个别地区而外，所有公私合营和私营企业将要改造成为完全没有剥削的社会主义企业。我国的工人阶级正在建设着自己的国家，建设着自己的幸福生活。在我国，国家利益和人民利益是一致的。
    从中华人民共和国成立时起，随着我国建设事业的发展，我国职工的劳动条件和生活状况已经有了重大的改变。几年来，我国的就业人数每年都有很大的增长，工人阶级的队伍在迅速地扩大起来；我国职工的现行工资，比之1952年又有了提高。不久以前，国务院召开了工资会议，决定在今年将我国的工资制度在提高工资的基础上进行一次改革。在工资的增长方面，我们也将提前达到1957年的水平。几年来，我国职工的劳动条件得到了很大的改善。例如煤炭工业的职工，解放以前，他们的劳动条件是极恶劣的，可是现在，他们已经大大地减少了笨重的体力劳动。现在，国营煤炭工业45％以上的煤是用联合采煤机、截煤机或风镐开采的，其余50％几的煤是用电钻或风钻打眼，然后放炮开采的。80％以上的井下工作面和平巷的运输工作已经机械化。在井下，许多通风机代替了原来的自然通风，井下工人每分钟已经能够得到三立方米的新鲜空气。到1955年，我国职工中有570万人享受了劳动保险，由国家和企业支出的保险费用达到50，500万元，这笔费用相当于享受保险待遇的全体职工工资总额的12.39％。在今后一两年内，将扩大劳动保险的范围和人数，我国的绝大部分职工将都能享受劳动保险。
    几年来，在许多风景优美的地区已经建立了不少工人疗养院；在我们的企业里，比较普遍地建立了业余休养所，一批一批的职工已经能够到良好的环境下进行治疗和休息。几年来，我们的国家和企业拿出大批款项来用于改善职工的居住条件和文化生活条件，现在，在工矿区的附近已经出现了一个一个的新的工人住宅区，在工矿区和大企业里已经建立了很多个文化宫、俱乐部和运动场。这些，是我们工人生活中过去从来没有过的事。
    社会主义是在不断提高劳动生产率、不断发展生产的前提下来不断满足人们日益增长的需要的。我国职工从过去几年的实际生活体验中已经完全清楚地看到社会主义的美景，所以许多职工同志说：“听到社会主义，心里就开了花，浑身都是劲”。为了建设自己的国家、建设自己的生活、建设社会主义的劳动，是工人阶级自觉的劳动，我国职工的新的劳动态度就是在这个基础上产生，并且日益巩固和发展起来的。
    我国的职工把生产当做自己切身的事情，广大职工深切地关心着生产的发展，从来不满足已经达到的生产水平。他们每天都在改善着机器和工具，改善着生产组织和劳动组织；他们利用每一分钟的工时，发挥每一台机床和每一块生产面积的作用，来提高产品数量、增加产品品种、改善产品质量、降低产品成本。所有这些，就使我国的劳动生产率迅速地增长起来。
    建设社会主义的高度热情，使人们产生出克服一切困难的坚强意志。同志们可能已经知道李来财同志的事迹，他在抗美援朝战争中失去了双脚，照通常的情况来说，他不仅不能工作，而且是需要人来照顾的。但是，李来财同志一心所想的却是参加祖国伟大的建设事业，他经过了几年的艰苦斗争，终于使自己成为一个优秀的拖拉机手，而且以他自己在生产中取得的成就而列入先进生产者的行列。我们全国的职工也正在各自的岗位上以坚强的意志和无比的英雄气概克服着一切困难。这种建设社会主义的英雄气概使“高山向我们低头，河水给我们让路”。
    在我国，人们热爱着自己的职业。我们的商业工作者除了做到“百问不烦，百选不厌”之外，还主动地设法满足顾客的需要；我们的邮务工作人员在努力提高效率的同时，尽力做到消灭差错，并且使大量地址不明的信件找到它的主人；我们的炊事人员使人们吃到“又香、又热、又干净、又便宜”的饭菜……。既然这些工作都是为人民服务的，我们的广大职工就全心全意地做好这些工作。
    我国工人阶级的劳动积极性和创造性，集中地表现在社会主义竞赛中。解放以后，随着工人阶级政治地位的根本变化和生活的改善，社会主义竞赛就很快地在全国许多地方开展起来，现在，它更以空前广泛的规模在全国范围内开展起来了。在企业中，不仅生产工人参加了竞赛，而且大批大批的工程技术人员、职员、辅助工人、附属事业单位的人员也参加了竞赛。广大的科学工作者、教育工作者、文艺工作者、医务工作者和机关工作者也都在社会主义建设的高潮中活跃起来。他们自愿地承担了看来是十分艰巨的任务，并且出色地完成着这些任务，创造了许多值得歌颂的事迹。
    在目前的社会主义竞赛中，涌现了大批的先进生产者、先进工作者和先进单位。这些先进人物和先进单位，都是以创造性的劳动突破生产定额、创造新纪录、节约地利用国家财富的榜样。根据今年三月以前的统计，上海涌现了五万多名先进生产者；北京涌现了20，525名先进生产者；江苏省涌现了21，128名先进生产者；新疆维吾尔自治区涌现了一万二千多名先进生产者；陕西省的西安市涌现了3，877名先进生产者；河北省的唐山市涌现了9，463名先进生产者；辽宁省沈阳等十个市涌现了36，448名先进生产者和2，448个先进单位，有六万多工人突破了各种定额；全国铁路系统有90％以上的火车司机都突破了运输定额。这些先进生产者提出了大量的合理化建议，创造了许多先进经验，对生产起了重大的作用。在各产业部门、各地区的先进生产者的带动下，经过全体职工的努力，1956年第一季度全国国营、地方国营和公私合营三千多个重点企业的总产值计划完成了105％。
    在我们建设社会主义的道路上还横着无数的困难，我们必须充分地估计到这些事实上存在着的困难。但是，在中国共产党领导和教育下的中国工人阶级，必然会用自己的刚强的乐观的革命精神，用对待建设事业的负责精神和无穷的智慧来克服一切困难。工人阶级的积极性和创造性是我们建设社会主义无穷无尽的力量源泉，是我们建设社会主义的首要保证。
    二、我们的方针是“又多、又快、又好、又省”
    我们一切工作的直接目的，就是超额完成社会主义建设计划。为了达到这个目的，我们的工作都必须遵照党中央所指示的“又多、又快、又好、又省”的方针来进行。遵照党中央所指示的这个方针，就可以把我国建设中的巨大潜在力量发掘出来，加快社会主义建设的速度。相反的，如果违背这个方针，就会造成很大人力、物力、财力的浪费，延缓我们建设的速度。
    “又多、又快、又好、又省”，是党和全国人民为了社会主义建设的需要，对各方面工作，首先是对生产厂矿和基本建设单位提出的要求。这就是要求生产厂矿和基本建设单位在好和省的前提下生产得又多、又快，全面地超额完成各项技术经济指标。在做到“又多、又快”的同时，必须注意“又好、又省”；在做到“又好、又省”的同时，必须注意“又多、又快”，对任何方面的忽视，都会给社会主义建设造成损失。
    “又要马儿跑，又要马儿不吃草”，是办不到的事，可是“又多、又快、又好、又省”却是合理的要求，因为这是要求喂马的人不要浪费草料，而又能喂成最快、最壮的马，这是完全可以办得到的。第一机械工业部所属天津、上海和沈阳三个自行车厂的职工人数相差不多、产品相同、工艺过程相近、设备和规模也大致相同（其中沈阳厂经过改建后在设备上还比其他两个厂好些），但是这三个厂的生产成果却不同。沈阳厂1955年的计划产量只等于天津厂计划产量的44.8％，等于上海厂的41.4％；沈阳厂1955年第一季度的劳动生产率比天津厂低53.8％，比上海厂低52.2％；沈阳厂在去年第一季度曾经因为产品质量太坏，返修一万多辆，几乎关厂。为什么沈阳厂落后呢？其真正原因是在于管理不善和没有注意加强群众工作。后来，三个厂组织了厂际竞赛，在竞赛中，虽然沈阳厂还落在后面，但是质量上有突出的进步，从去年八月以后，也能按月完成国家计划，逐月降低成本。从沈阳自行车厂的事例中可以明白地看出，暂时还落在后面的厂矿只要经过努力，就可以赶上先进水平，就可以达到“又多、又快、又好、又省”。我们在座的很多同志的事迹也说明，每一个工人的工作也是能够做到“又多、又快、又好、又省”的。上海国营第二纺织机械厂第一金工车间刨工曹永康在三年的时间内作了六年八个月零十五天的活，没有出过一个废品。国营石家庄货车修理厂旋工王新年在1955年12月16日提前完成了第一个五年计划时期的个人工作量，给国家多创造了20， 032个车轮，可以多按装2，500多辆货车，而且质量全部合格。像这样的事例可以举出很多很多。
    当前，值得引起我们特别注意的是，我们的产品质量一般还不高，有些产品的质量是很不能令人满意的。我们必须改变这种状况，努力改善产品的质量。
    提高产品质量对于发展生产和提高人民生活有极大的意义。同志们都知道，我们的重工业工厂的产品是供给重工业本身和轻工业、农业、运输业以技术装备的，如果我们在生产中只注意“多”、“快”而不注意“好”，因而质量不合规格，造成返修报废，不仅使自己不能真正做到“多”、“快”和“省”，而且妨碍使用这些装备的部门做到又多、又快、又好、又省。我们的轻工业工厂的产品是用来满足人民生活需要的，我国人民的生活水平正在迅速提高，人民所需要的是品质优良的产品。新疆少数民族地区的姑娘们写信给上海纺织工厂，要求他们“生产更多更好的像天上云彩一样美丽的花布，让我们都打扮得漂漂亮亮的去参加草原上的跳舞”，这种要求是应该满足的。质量高的产品经久耐用、能够充分发挥它的效能，这本身就是最大的节约。还应该看到，不断地提高对产品质量的要求，也才能够促使我国工业生产的技术水平不断地提高。
    提高产品质量和工作质量，这就是严肃地对待自己的工作，就是对社会主义建设事业负责，就是对人民负责。
    我们还要特别注意加强新产品试制的工作。我国现在在进行社会改革的同时，也正在进行着技术改革。在技术改革的过程中，工业和农业都要求我们制造出许多过去我国不能制造的新产品，而且随着社会主义建设事业的发展，对新产品的要求将要越来越多，越来越迫切。几年来，我国产品品种的增加是迅速的。到去年年底，机械工业试制成功了二千五百多种新产品，黑色和有色金属工业在1954年一年就试制成功二百二十多种新产品。三年来轻工业增加的新产品共有2，748种。很多过去我国从来没有制造过的产品现在已经成批生产了。但是，新产品的试制还远远赶不上工业建设和农业建设的需要，所以必须加速扩大新产品的数量和提高新产品的质量，这是为我国国民经济的技术改造奠定基础的重大工作。
    当然，我们还必须厉行节约，即努力做到“省”。只有厉行节约，才能保证建设资金的积累；如果不注意节约，就会浪费掉国家的许多资金，就会削弱我们的建设力量。为了降低产品成本，节约国家资金，班组经济核算的办法是值得提倡的。
    在今后相当长的一段时期内，我国还必须主要靠原有企业来供应各方面所需要的产品，例如在第一个五年计划时期内，原有工业企业的产值就占工业总产值的70％左右。因此，我们最大的节约就是充分发挥原有企业的设备能力，把这些企业的潜在能力发掘出来，为社会主义建设服务。
    要做到“又多、又快、又好、又省”，特别是要做到提高质量、试制更多的新产品，第一要提高技术水平，加强技术管理工作；第二要加强劳动纪律，特别是加强技术纪律；第三要加强劳动保护工作，为工人的劳动创造必要的良好条件。
    现在，我们无论在增加产品数量、提高产品质量、降低产品成本或是试制新产品方面，都出现了许多新的纪录，目前最重要的事情是要把这些纪录巩固起来，并且扩大它的经济效果。新的纪录显示了在现有条件下我们可能达到更高的生产水平，也显示了达到这种水平的具体道路。这个道路就是推广先进生产者的经验。因为新的纪录的经济效果，只有在大多数人达到这样的生产水平的时候才能充分地表现出来。
    1956年将是我国的国民经济更加活跃和更加高涨的一年。根据初步拟定的1956年的计划，同1955年相比，工业总产值将增长21.7％；农业总产值将增长11.5％，其中粮食产量将增长约9.1％，棉花产量将增长约18％；基本建设投资额将增长68.1％；其他经济事业和科学、文化、教育、卫生等事业也将采取比较快的速度向前发展。只要我们努力完成1956年的计划，我们就有可能在主要指标方面，提早半年至一年达到第一个五年计划最后一年的生产水平。
    我们在生产中涌现了几十万先进生产者，他们用改进技术、学习和掌握新技术、改进生产组织和劳动组织等等方法提早完成了或者将要提早完成他们在第一个五年计划时期的工作量。既然他们能够这样做，我们全国的职工也是能够这样做的。如果全国广大职工都能够这样做，那么，大部分企业在1956年年底达到1957年的生产水平是完全可能的。
    三、互相学习、互相帮助、取长补短、共同提高
    社会主义竞赛的主要任务就是要大力支持先进生产者的创举，推广先进生产者的经验，把它变成为全体工人阶级所掌握的财富。
    几年来，国民经济各部门已经积累了丰富的先进经验，这是广大职工群众辛勤劳动、努力钻研的结果，也是认真总结自己的并且学习苏联的先进经验的结果。只要我们很好地运用这些先进经验，推广这些先进经验，就能够达到又多、又快、又好、又省的要求。
    推广了苏联优秀炼钢工人科列斯尼科夫的经验，仅鞍钢一个单位就在去年10月份一个月里为国家多增产了八千四百多吨钢锭。如果所有炼钢工人都掌握了这个先进经验，今年就可以为国家多增产几十万吨钢锭。
    推广了李川江榨油法和其它的榨油先进经验，去年油脂业就为国家多增产了二亿六千万斤植物油。
    推广了艾肇昌的节约汽油的经验，去年第四季度在公路运输系统就扭转了上半年亏油的局面，而且还节约了二百多万公升汽油。
    这些只不过是千万个例子中的几个，但是，它已经可以充分说明推广先进经验有着多么巨大的经济意义。
    当然，为了推广先进经验，要做很多工作。推广先进经验是一件十分细致的组织工作，决不是开一次大会号召一番就能够办到的。推广先进经验以后，也还不可避免地会出现新的薄弱环节。企业管理必须适应新的情况，采取一系列的技术组织措施，尤其要做好技术供应工作，及时供应图纸、工具、刀具、原料、材料，以保证先进经验能够推广下去。在这方面有些企业已经取得了很好的经验，可是还有许多企业做得不够好。
    同时，我们还应该认识到推广先进经验也是我们全体职工自己的事情。在这里，我想说一下社会主义竞赛的原则。只有认真地贯彻执行了社会主义竞赛的原则，才能把先进经验迅速地推广到广大群众中去。
    什么是社会主义竞赛的根本原则呢？概括说来就是：“互相学习、互相帮助、取长补短、共同提高”。
    社会主义竞赛要求先进生产者热情地耐心地帮助其他在生产上暂时落后的职工。道理是很明显的：要想全面超额完成国家计划，只有少数人先进是远远不够的，必须多数人都达到先进水平才行。大连造船公司詹水晶同志亲身经历的一件事情，可以有力地说明这个道理。詹水晶是一位优秀的老车工，他在解放以后，在生产中发挥了高度的负责精神，勤勤恳恳，兢兢业业，八年没有出过一件废品，而且月月超额完成国家计划，现在他已经超额完成了第一个五年计划的个人工作量，已经在做着1958年的工作了。可是他所在的小组却并不先进，去年一连八个月没有完成国家计划，而且还常常出废品。这就充分说明了光是一个人先进，是不大顶事的。后来詹水晶同志采取了积极办法帮助别人，动员小组的每个老师傅带一个青工，他自己也带两个青工，这样一来，就很快扭转了局面，今年一、二月份他们的小组超额完成了国家计划，并且消灭了废品。这充分说明了当先进生产者发扬了互助合作的共产主义精神的时候，给生产带来了多么大的好处。
    一般说，谁都是不甘心落后的，在最近三、四个月以来，更加明显地看出广大群众都满怀热情地在学习着先进经验，问题就在于我们是否耐心地帮助他们。我们决不能以固定的观点去看待那些在生产上暂时落后的同志。有一些同志对于暂时落后的同志却采取了非同志的歧视的态度，他们不去具体分析落后的原因，也不具体帮助他们，而是随便给人家扣一个“落后”帽子，甚至还要讽刺他们是什么“老落后”、“老顽固”、“废品大王”。现在已有无数的事实告诉我们，只要我们热情地关心他们、耐心地帮助他们，不少过去所谓落后的同志，是完全可以变为先进生产者的。
    我们在这里要着重批判一下“优胜劣败”的思想。某些人为了自己争取“优胜”，就希望别人“劣败”，不愿意把自己的先进经验告诉别人，深怕别人进步了，就显不出自己的先进。这完全是一种资本主义思想的余毒在作怪。在资本主义社会里，资本家为了自己的胜利，总是要设法挤垮别人。但是在我们的社会里，人与人的关系已经起了根本的变化，大家都是为了共同的目的而工作着，只有整个社会前进了，个人才有可能建立起幸福的生活。自己先进了，还帮助别人先进，这不仅不会失掉荣誉，相反的，这会更加受到广大群众的爱戴。
    另一方面，我们也要看到，先进生产者也不一定处处都是先进的，一个人的智慧毕竟是有限的，一个人的经验不可能是完备无缺的，而广大群众却有无穷无尽的智慧和才能。只有在互相学习和互相帮助中，才能取人之长补我之短。先进生产者之所以先进，是经常向广大群众学习的结果。先进经验也只有广大群众互相补充才能更加完善起来。在前边所说的三个自行车厂的竞赛中，沈阳厂原来是最落后的，但是天津上海的厂还在沈阳厂学习到不少先进经验，而这些先进经验正是天津上海厂的短处。若是一个先进生产者或者一个先进工厂自己以为什么都比别人强，骄傲自满起来，那就会从先进的位置上跌落下去。我们应当永远记住，我们每个人只是群众中的一员，跟群众不能分家，谁要把自己和群众隔离起来，谁就是跳出水面的鱼，结果只有被太阳晒成鱼干。
    因此，我们大家要想不断地先进，在先进的基础上再求先进，那就要经常地开展批评和自我批评。互相帮助、互相学习的过程也正是批评和自我批评的过程。我们对于先进人物、先进单位也不应当只注意鼓励（这当然是必要的）而不注意批评。有些同志不了解这点，往往把先进生产者偶像化了，有了缺点，也不敢批评，群众批评了，还要说“小声点，不要把这面旗帜弄倒了”。其实这不是爱护这面旗帜，而是在帮着把这面旗帜弄倒。
    在互相学习、互相帮助、取长补短、共同提高方面，工程技术人员和生产工人的合作起着重大的作用。生产工人有多年劳动的实际经验，这正是一般工程技术人员所缺少的，而工程技术人员有系统的科学理论知识，这又正是生产工人所缺少的，取长补短，正好使工程技术人员的科学技术理论和生产工人的劳动经验结合起来。这方面需要工程技术人员高度地发挥主动性，经常深入到生产工人中去研究他们的操作特点，及时发现和总结他们的先进经验。凡是这样做的，就能取得显著的成绩。最近有很多重大的革新事迹，就是工程技术人员和生产工人合作的结果。抚顺煤矿技术员周广瑞和掘煤工人庞观祥合作改进了采煤方法和劳动组织，提高了工作效率两倍，就是一个很好的证明。
    此外，我们还应该注意企业内部和企业之间的劳动协作。在现代化的生产中，各方面都需要密切配合。快速炼钢不仅是炼钢工人的事情，同时也是铸锭工人、吊车工人的事情，如果炼钢工人缩短了工时，而其他工序配合不上，那仍然是不能多出钢的，甚至钢的性能还会变化。因此，在竞赛中的互助合作原则，要贯彻到各个方面去。班与班、组与组要相互协作，上下工序要相互协作，职能部门和生产车间要相互协作，厂与厂、公司与公司之间也要密切配合。我们要工作得像一个管弦乐队一样的和谐，弹奏出向社会主义进军的雄伟歌曲。
    四、我国工人阶级要成为有高度文化的、能够掌握现代科学技术的阶级
    我国的工人阶级，是在中国共产党的领导和教育下久经考验、具有高度觉悟和高度组织性的阶级，但是，从科学和文化技术水平来说，必须承认，我们还是很落后的。这种科学和文化技术方面的落后，是我国工人阶级的一个严重的弱点。为了加速我国的社会主义建设，必须充分发挥我国工人阶级的积极性和创造性。同时，还必须向苏联的先进科学学习；向世界一切国家的先进科学学习，来克服这个严重的弱点。
    我国的社会主义建设事业正在迅速向前发展，许多新建和扩建的企业正在陆续投入生产，许多旧企业正在进行着技术改造，我国的生产中将要越来越多地采用最新的、现代科学技术的成就。只有把我们的文化水平和科学技术水平大大提高，才能够掌握这些新的技术，才能够满足整个建设事业对工程技术人员和技术工人的大量需要。我们每一个工人、每一个先进生产者，只有在提高了文化、掌握了技术的情况下，才能在生产上做出更大的成就。北京农业机械厂老技工于德水，过去只懂得万能铣床的一种操作方法，他参加了二年半文化学习以后，不但能完全操纵万能铣床，而且还帮助三个徒工提高到技工的水平。公路总局设计局第三分局第一测量队的许多测量工都是刚从农村中出来的农民，他们不认识桩号，出了不少差错，可是在经过一年多的文化学习以后，已经全部扫除了文盲，现在不但已经能够写信、写报告、看报刊杂志，而且能绘制横断面图，计算土石方数量，有的还能够担任地形测量、水平测量等初级技术员的工作了。
    工人阶级的文化、技术水平的低下，是同我国整个科学技术的落后状态相关联的。目前的世界已开始进入原子能时代，许多新的科学一日千里地向前发展。苏联在1954年就建立了世界上第一个原子能发电站；放射性同位素在化学、生物学、医学、农学、冶金学、机械学等各种研究工作上的应用，促进了生产和各种事业的发展；在钢铁冶炼方面，苏联最近正在设计450到500吨的大型炼钢平炉和1，500立方公尺的大型炼铁高炉，而我们的水平却还和这些成就的水平相距很远。我国工业的迅速发展，已经向科学界提出大量的要求：我们要建设几个新的钢铁基地，从地质、采矿、冶炼直到炉渣的处理和利用，都需要做大量的科学研究工作；石油资源的勘探、煤炭的合理利用、机械制造的设计和技术改造、化学产品的研究和试制、人造橡胶的合成、适合于我国土地和作物的农业机械的创制等等，件件都需要科学工作者的努力。党中央号召科学工作者要在尽可能短的时期内使中国的科学达到世界先进水平，我们的政府也已经采取了许多具体措施来实现这个伟大的号召，全国人民都在期待着科学家的成就。完全可以确信，我们的科学家们决不会辜负党的号召和人民的期待。在不久的将来，“我们将以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界”。
    改变我国工人阶级文化水平和科学技术水平的落后状况，这是我们建设社会主义的事业中有决定意义的任务之一。使我国工人阶级具有高度的文化水平和科学技术水平，这当然不是一件容易的事情，但是，做好那一件工作是容易的呢？推翻几千年的封建统治应该说是困难的，但是我们完成了；推翻帝国主义在我国的侵略势力和蒋介石集团的统治应该说是困难的，但是我们也完成了。同样，我们也可以说，当前的这个任务是困难的，但是在中国共产党领导下的工人阶级，经过努力也一定能够完成。
    科学研究工作应当尽可能地与生产实践联结起来，从生产实践中来提出研究课题，用生产实践中提供的经验来丰富和检证科学理论，同时，又以科学理论和研究的成果来指导生产实践。这种科学研究机关与生产企业的合作，科学工作者与生产工作者的合作，对于提高科学研究水平和提高生产技术水平都会带来良好的效果。现在，已经有一些科学研究机关和科学家注意到这个问题，这是很好的。
    几年来，我国工程技术人员的状况已经有了很大的改变。我们现在的技术人员的队伍，大体上可以分做三个部分：一部分是老技术人员，他们经过思想改造和总结自己的经验，学习苏联和其他国家的先进技术经验，在政治觉悟和技术水平方面都有明显的提高。这一部分是我国技术人员中的骨干力量。第二部分是从工人中选拔出来的，他们在党和国家的培养下，经过自己的努力，掌握了一定的技术知识，他们的长处是有劳动经验，并且和工人有着密切的联系。第三部分是刚从学校里毕业的青年学生，他们是在新的教育制度下培养出来的知识分子，他们的长处是积极热情，肯于学习。工程技术人员状况的这种改变，使工程技术人员内部、工程技术人员和工人之间的关系也起了变化，工程技术人员内部、工程技术人员和工人团结起来了，因而在提高职工的技术水平方面，工程技术人员起了并且起着重大的作用。几年来，我国工程技术人员在帮助工人提高技术水平方面做了很多工作，创造了很多有实际效果的办法。最近，长春第一汽车制造厂变速箱车间实行了“连锁”教学法，即由每个工程师带两个高级技术员，每个高级技术员带两个中级技术员或工长，每个中级技术员带两个初级技术员、车间调整工或文化较低的工长，这样一直连锁地传授到工人。在传授技术知识的时候，根据各级对象的具体需要，运用不同的传授方法来传授不同的内容。这个变速箱车间已经有80％的人参加了这样的学习。此外，各地工程技术人员还主持或者参加了技术学习班、技术研究会、技术讲座，组织了包教包学等等。在目前，工程技术人员的重要任务之一，就是发展些这行之有效的办法，并且加强在实际生产中同工人的合作。
    提高文化水平，是掌握科学、技术知识的前提。现在，我国广大职工群众学习文化的热情是很高的，这是社会主义热情高涨的一种表现。从1956年起，我们要在三年内扫除全国职工中的文盲，当然这还只是提高文化水平的第一个步骤，在这个基础上，还必须有系统地把我们的文化水平提高到初中、高中甚至大学的程度。在帮助职工提高文化水平方面，我们的知识分子和已经掌握了文化的工人应当努力贡献自己的力量。
    我们特别希望先进生产者和先进工作者成为学习文化技术的模范。先进生产者要取得更光辉的成就，要永远保持这个先进的称号，就必须努力学习文化技术。我们也特别希望先进生产者和先进工作者给文化技术水平低的同志以实际的帮助。
    五、打破保守思想，反对官僚主义
    在我们的社会主义企业里，全体工作人员的努力目标是一致的，从工人到企业的领导者都是共同为完成国家计划而努力的。但是在社会主义企业里，仍然是存在着矛盾的，这种矛盾就是新与旧、先进与落后、积极与消极的矛盾。无论在什么时候，生产总是不断地发展的，新技术要不断地被采用，旧技术要不断地被改进，这就要求我们在生产组织、劳动组织以及管理制度和技术规程等等方面也不断地适应这种改变。可是在人们头脑中残存着的资本主义思想不可能在短时期内清除干净，这种残存的资本主义思想必然要或多或少地对企业的工作发生实际的影响。而且即使资本主义思想完全清除了以后，由于人们的认识往往落后于客观事物和生活的发展，因而新与旧、先进与落后、积极与消极的矛盾也还是会存在的。我们的社会主义建设事业，就是要从不断地克服这些矛盾中发展起来，也就是说，要不断地支持新的、先进的、积极的事物，使它们生长和推广，不断地消除旧的、落后的、消极的事物，使它不能阻碍我们前进。克服社会主义企业的内部矛盾的主要方法是批评和自我批评，克服这种矛盾的力量就是党的领导和广大职工群众的负责精神，就是广大职工对于企业管理工作的监督。
    最近的事实更加清楚地说明，只要我们能够揭露和克服矛盾，就能大大地挖掘企业的潜力。不少企业的领导同志在三、四个月以前还在叫喊困难，对提前半年到一年完成五年计划信心不足。可是现在已经很少听到这种呼声了。许多过去认为是困难的事，现在不困难了；过去认为暂时不可能解决的问题现在能解决了。工人还是原来的工人，工厂还是原来的工厂，为什么现在能够把企业内部的潜在力量大大地挖掘出来呢？就是由于最近在党中央的号召下，广泛地发动了群众，批判了右倾保守思想。
    在高涨的社会主义竞赛中，群众以实际行动揭发了右倾保守思想。这种右倾保守思想是各式各样的。有的强调不能打破“均衡”，有的强调不能打破旧的技术标准，有的强调潜力挖得差不多了，有的故意把计划订得低一些，以便将来不费力气就可以超额完成……。不论那种形式的保守思想，它们的共同之点就是看不见群众的积极性和创造性。那些有保守思想的人们只注意死的设备和死的资料，而不注意或不很注意活动着的人这个最根本的因素，不注意或不很注意劳动人民的创造能力以及已经积累起来的许多先进经验。
    许多存在着保守思想的领导人，并不是自觉的。他们往往以为自己的思想并不保守。但是，如果他们能够深入群众，了解实际情况，就会发现他们是远远落后于群众、落后于实际的，这就能够促使他们有效地去克服右倾保守思想。
    许多工厂的计划一经群众讨论就纷纷被提高了，鞍钢今年原来只计划增产七万吨钢，群众讨论以后，认为可以增产十二万吨；五三厂原来计划提前九个月完成五年计划，群众讨论以后，认为可以提前一年零四十六天。
    这里，可以得出一条经验：要打破保守思想，就要反对脱离实际、脱离群众的官僚主义。反对官僚主义最有效的方法就是广泛地开展群众性的自下而上的批评，建立起群众性的监督制度。每一个职工都应该以高度的国家主人翁的责任心，来关心企业的生产，在职工大会上，在生产会议上，在工会小组会上，或者采取其他的方式，严肃地揭发一切阻碍生产发展的右倾保守思想和官僚主义现象，并且积极提出改进生产的建议。如果我们容忍保守思想和官僚主义，就等于延缓社会主义建设的进程。
    当然，在和右倾保守思想、官僚主义现象作斗争的时候，决不会是一帆风顺的。但是，在我们国家里，新生力量是会得到党和政府的支持的。我们应该勇于坚持真理。我们坚决相信，只要依靠党、依靠集体，正确的意见一定会最后取得胜利。
    工会是工人阶级的最富有群众性的组织。它是党联系群众的引带。在组织先进生产者运动，充分发挥职工群众的积极性和创造性来加速社会主义建设方面，工会负有重大的责任。但是，工会在这方面的工作还是做得很不深入的。这必须引起工会各级组织的注意。为了进一步发挥广大职工的积极性和创造性，工会必须同经济组织、青年团一道，引导群众去参加企业的管理工作，而参加企业管理工作的主要方式就是群众监督。工会组织尤其要高度地发扬民主，倾听群众的意见，大力支持先进人物的创举，为先进生产者运动开辟道路。工会组织还必须主动地关心群众生活，使群众从物质利益上来关心自己的劳动成果。同时，工会组织的一切工作，都必须放在群众的严格监督之下。
    反对右倾保守倾向和官僚主义，决不是消极的空喊，而是要实事求是地去调查研究，具体分析企业中的生产关键和薄弱环节，要发挥集体智慧来解决这些生产关键和薄弱环节。监督，同时就是对于企业行政的帮助，所以它是引导职工参加企业管理的主要方式。如果把监督单纯地变成对于企业行政的指责，而不积极地提出改进工作的意见，那就会发生不好的作用。此外，我们还必须注意，在工矿企业里，不能够片面强调“打破常规”。在工矿企业里，确实存在着一些官僚主义的“常规”，但这多半是属于管理制度方面的。例如合理化建议处理方面还有许多麻烦手续，工资奖励方面还有一些不合理的制度，职工生活福利设施方面也有种种不合理的规定，这些“常规”经过认真的研究和一定的组织手续是应当打破的。可是有关生产技术方面的常规，例如工艺技术规程、安全技术规程，那是决不可以随意打破的。当然，工艺技术规程、安全技术规程也并不是一成不变的，可是要改变这些常规，必须经过技术上的审查鉴定，而且要经过严格的手续。否则就会造成灾害。如果借口“打破常规”，随意违反这些规程，以致增加了废品，增加了事故，那是完全不许可的。
    同志们，先进生产者运动已经广泛地开展起来了。现在的任务就是要不断地扩大先进生产者的队伍，努力推广先进经验，使先进生产者运动成为推动社会主义事业向前迅速发展的一个强大动力。我们有伟大的中国共产党的英明领导，我们有伟大的盟邦——苏联和各人民民主国家兄弟般的援助，我们有战无不胜的马克思列宁主义的指导，我们有全世界进步人士的同情和支持，只要我们兢兢业业地、实事求是地在建设社会主义的道路上英勇前进，我们就一定能够实现在六万万人口的国土上建成社会主义这个具有极其伟大的世界意义的事业。
    我们伟大的祖国万岁！
    我国工人阶级和全体劳动人民万岁！
    领导我国人民向社会主义进军的伟大的中国共产党万岁！
