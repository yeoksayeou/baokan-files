    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th - On May 13, 1921, Lenin signed the decree on establishing sanatoriums in the Soviet Union. Thirty-five years have passed since then.
    The Soviet "Komsomolskaya Pravda" of May 13 wrote that in the past thirty-five years, the Soviet Union has established many sanatoriums. At present, there are more than 3,000 sanatoriums and health resorts throughout the country. In 1956, more than five million working people will rest in these sanatoriums and health resorts.
    During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the distribution network of Soviet sanatoriums and health resorts will be further expanded. Many new sanatoriums and health resorts will be established in the central and northern regions of the European part of the Soviet Union, in the Urals, Siberia, the Far East, as well as in Central Asia and Kazakhstan. Many of them can be completed this summer and receive vacationers.

    This year, the appropriation for the recuperation and medical treatment of working people has increased to more than nine times that of 1949. Many new sanatoriums have been built in various places, and the original health resorts have been re-equipped and expanded. To facilitate the recuperation of the working people, restaurants and eateries have been added in the recuperation areas.

    社会主义国家劳动人民有休息权
    ·苏联·
    新华社莫斯科17日电　1921年5月13日，列宁签署了关于在苏联建立休养所的法令。从那时候到现在已经三十五年了。
    五月十三日的苏联“共青团真理报”写道，在过去三十五年中，苏联建立了许多休养所。目前，全国各地共有三千多个休养所和疗养院。1956年，到这些休养所和疗养院休养的劳动人民将有五百多万人。
    在第六个五年计划期间，苏联休养所和疗养院的分布网将进一步扩大。在苏联欧洲部分的中部和北部地区，在乌拉尔、西伯利亚、远东地区以及中亚细亚和哈萨克，将建立许多新的休养所和疗养院。其中有许多在今年夏季就可以建成并且接纳休养者。
    ·罗马尼亚·
    新华社22日讯　塔斯社布加勒斯特二十一日讯：罗马尼亚的夏季疗养季节开始了。今年预计有五十万劳动人民将到风景秀丽的喀尔巴阡山和黑海沿岸的休养所和疗养院去休养。
    今年用于劳动人民休养和医疗的拨款增加到1949年的九倍多。各地新建了许多休养所，原有的疗养院也都重新加以装备和扩充了。为了便利劳动人民的休养，在疗养地区增添了饮食店和饭馆。疗养院的图书馆补充了很多新书。单是给工会系统休养所拨付增购书报的款项就有三十二万五千列伊（罗币）。
    保加利亚
    新华社布拉格22日电　据保加利亚通讯社报道：保加利亚今年将有二十多万劳动者到工会系统举办的休养所休假。几天以前，全国一些著名的疗养院已经开始接待头几批前来休养的客人。再过几天，高山地区的矿泉疗养院和阳光充足的黑海沿岸的休养所，也要接纳休假的人了。
    除了到疗养地区休养的人以外，保加利亚今年还将有五千三百多人到全国各地游览，另外还有许多劳动者利用假期到全国的各疗养地旅行。
