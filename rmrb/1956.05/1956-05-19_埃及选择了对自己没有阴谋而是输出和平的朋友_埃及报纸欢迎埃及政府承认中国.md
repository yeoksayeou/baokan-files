Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 18th: All the newspapers here published the news of Egypt's recognition of the People's Republic of China on the front page with red banner headlines spanning the entire page. Many newspapers carried editorials on the matter. All newspapers unanimously believe that, in the current international situation, Egypt's decision to recognize the People's Republic of China, which has a population of 600 million, is an event of great significance.

"The Republic" newspaper's editorial said: "Egypt's recognition of the People's Republic of China is a heavy blow to Western diplomacy. The China recognized by the West (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan - Xinhua News Agency reporter's note) is a strange dream, but the China recognized by Egypt is a huge reality." The newspaper also pointed out that when the Arab people recognize People's China, they are not only recognizing a fait accompli, but also choosing a friend who does not plot against them but exports peace.

"Al-Ahram" wrote: "There is no doubt that the Egyptian government's decision to recognize the People's Republic of China is reasonable and wise. This is the right step in the right direction."

"Al-Ahram" said: "This decision is also fully in line with the spirit of the Bandung Conference resolutions, which declared the right of all countries and peoples to self-determination." "This policy serves Egypt's own interests first and foremost. This decision is in line with the desire for peaceful coexistence, consolidates the foundation of justice, and is a contribution to the cause of universal peace." The newspaper also advocated restoring the People's Republic of China's rights in the United Nations.

The French-language "Egyptian Gazette" said: "The people have been waiting for the Egyptian government to make this decision for a long time. This is an inevitable development. After the Bandung Conference, the development of economic and cultural relations between China and Egypt could not allow the two countries to fail to establish diplomatic relations for a long time."

    埃及选择了对自己没有阴谋而是输出和平的朋友
    埃及报纸欢迎埃及政府承认中国
    新华社开罗18日电　这里的各家报纸都以横贯整版的红字标题在第一版头条的版位刊登了埃及承认中华人民共和国的消息。很多报纸刊载了关于这件事的社论。所有报纸都一致认为，在目前的国际形势下，埃及承认拥有六亿人口的中华人民共和国的决定是一件具有巨大重要意义的事件。
    “共和国报”的社论说：“埃及承认中华人民共和国是对西方外交的一个沉重的打击。西方承认的中国（指台湾蒋介石集团——新华社记者注）是奇怪的梦，但是，埃及承认的中国是巨大的现实。”这家报纸还指出，当阿拉伯人民承认人民中国的时候，他们不仅是承认既成事实，而且还是选择了不对他们进行任何阴谋而是输出和平的朋友。
    “金字塔报”写道：“毫无疑问，埃及政府承认中华人民共和国的决定是通达情理的和明智的。这是朝着正确方向的正确步骤。”
    “金字塔报”说：“这个决定也完全符合宣布一切国家人民有自决权的万隆会议决议的精神。”“这种政策首先是为埃及本身的利益服务的。这个决定符合于和平共处的愿望，巩固正义的基础，并且是对普遍和平事业的贡献。”这家报纸还主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的权利。
    法文的“埃及报”说：“人民盼望埃及政府作出这种决定已经很久了。这是一种必然的发展。万隆会议以后，中国和埃及之间的经济和文化关系的发展不可能容许两国长期不建立外交关系。”
