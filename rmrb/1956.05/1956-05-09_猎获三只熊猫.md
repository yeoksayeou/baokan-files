    Hunting Three Pandas
    The panda is a rare and precious animal in the world. Since the beginning of this year, the Sichuan Animal Collection Team of the Beijing Gardening Bureau has hunted one giant panda and two lesser pandas in Baoxing County, Ya'an Prefecture, Sichuan Province.

    These three pandas are currently being cared for and managed by special personnel in Baoxing. In just twenty days, the giant panda's weight has increased from ten kilograms to fourteen kilograms; and it has learned games such as somersaults and swinging.

    猎获三只熊猫
    熊猫是世界稀有的珍奇动物。今年以来，北京园林局四川搜集动物组又在四川省雅安专区宝兴县猎获了大熊猫一只、小熊猫二只。
    这三只熊猫现还在宝兴由专人饲养管理。仅二十天时间，大熊猫的体重已由十公斤增加到十四公斤；并学会了翻斤斗、打秋千等游戏。
