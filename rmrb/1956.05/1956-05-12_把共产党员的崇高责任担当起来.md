    Taking on the Lofty Responsibilities of a Communist Party Member

    In my youth, it was the era when imperialists were attempting to carve up China. Young people living in that era all hoped that the motherland would become prosperous and strong as soon as possible. At that time, I heard that the United States was a "democratic" and "advanced" country, so I went to the United States to study with the ambition of "saving the country through industry." However, as soon as I entered the United States, I encountered the discrimination and insults of the Immigration Bureau of that country against the Chinese, which made me have a very bad impression of the United States. After living in the United States for a few years, I became even more suspicious: How could such a country, which oppresses small and weak nations abroad, discriminates against people of color at home, and cruelly exploits workers, be considered "democratic" and "advanced"? Should China also take this path? If not, what better path is there? After returning to China, I personally suffered the ravages of warlord wars, the various persecutions of the Kuomintang reactionaries and imperialists, and saw the increasing poverty of farmers. I deeply felt that this society had to be changed, but I couldn't find the correct answer on how to change it. So I had to bury myself in my teaching and scientific research work with the aim of "saving the country through science" under extremely difficult conditions.

    My correct understanding of the Communist Party began after liberation. When I was studying in the United States, influenced by anti-communist propaganda, I not only thought that communism was not suitable for China, but also thought it was terrible. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, after contacting progressive youths and hearing about the situation in the liberated areas, and comparing the Communist Party with the Kuomintang, I began to feel that the Communist Party was better than the Kuomintang. But at that time, I still believed that any political party was a group that sought benefits for a few people, and that the Communist Party would inevitably become corrupt once it seized power, so I had no confidence in the Communist Party. After liberation, due to direct contact with Communist Party members, I gradually realized the noble qualities of Communist Party members who are loyal to the revolutionary cause, the pragmatic work style of seeking truth from facts, and the spirit of daring to criticize and self-criticize. Only then did I truly begin to change my incorrect views on the Communist Party and believe that the Communist Party is a party different from ordinary political parties. Then I participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the anti-bacterial warfare, the Three-Anti Movement and the ideological remoulding movement, and many social activities, and my class consciousness was further improved. At this time, I realized that the proletariat is the most advanced revolutionary class, and the Communist Party is the most advanced revolutionary political party. The Chinese people can only build their own free, happy, and prosperous country under the leadership of the proletariat and the Communist Party. And what touched me the most was the party and the state's meticulous care for scientific work and scientific workers. In the old society, I had to find ways to survive and create working conditions for myself with great difficulty, but now I have obtained such good living and working conditions.

    After the Central Committee issued the call to march towards science, I deeply realized that in order to better realize this call of the Party, I must first abandon the decadent ideas of individualism that used to drive my work, and replace them with proletarian ideology. Especially as I get older, and with not many years left, I should make more contributions to the socialist cause while my energy is still strong. After joining the Party, under the direct supervision of the Party, I can check myself against the standards of a Communist Party member at all times, which will undoubtedly speed up the process of self-reform, and at the same time enable me to do more work for the people and the country. Therefore, I decided to apply to join the Party.

    But when I applied to join the Party, I had two concerns: The first concern was that I had a good relationship with the masses in the past; after joining the Party, would my relationship with the masses be different from before, would it become alienated? The reason why I had this concern was because among senior intellectuals, there are still some people who are relatively alienated from party members, and they have many concerns about party members. After the help of the Party organization, I realized that the reason for this phenomenon is related to the fact that some senior intellectuals do not know enough about the Party and are unwilling to take the initiative to approach Party members, but mainly because some Party members are not good at uniting non-Party intellectuals, and there are many shortcomings in their work style and work methods. Therefore, after joining the Party, as long as I can take the initiative to unite the masses and unite the broad masses of people around the Party, the role I play will be greater than that of a non-Party member, and my relationship with the masses will be closer. The second concern was that I was afraid that the number of meetings would increase after joining the Party, which would affect my scientific research work. Later, I learned that the Party organization is paying attention to streamlining meetings, and the number of meetings will be greatly reduced in the future. At the same time, the reason why some meetings in the past took a long time and did not solve problems was mainly because the preparations before the meeting were not done well. This can be improved. At the same time, the Party organization also guarantees that a party member engaged in scientific research will spend most of their time on professional work. From my own point of view, joining the Party should not weaken scientific research work, but should strengthen scientific research work. This is the direction I should strive for.

    Some people also asked me, after you join the Party, will people say that you are opportunistic? I said I don't have this concern. Because scientists pursue truth regardless of everything, and people with this concern value themselves more than they value the truth.

    It is an honor to be a Communist Party member. But whether a person can truly enjoy this honor depends mainly not on the appearance, but on his actual actions. I am determined to continue to work hard so that I can truly take on the lofty responsibilities of a Communist Party member.

### 把共产党员的崇高责任担当起来

    把共产党员的崇高责任担当起来
    中国科学院植物研究所真菌植物病理研究室主任

    在我年青的时候，正是帝国主义企图瓜分中国的时代。生在那个时代的青年人，都希望祖国赶快富强起来。当时听说美国是一个“民主”“先进”的国家，我就抱着“实业救国”的志愿到美国去求学。可是一进美国就碰上这个国家的移民局对中国人的歧视和侮辱，使我对美国开始产生很不好的印象。在美国住了几年，更使我发生了怀疑：像这样一个国家，在国外压迫弱小民族，在国内歧视有色人种，残酷剥削工人，能算得上“民主”和“先进”吗？中国难道也应该走这条路吗？如果不走，又有什么更好的道路呢？回国以后，亲身受到军阀战争的摧残、国民党反动派和帝国主义种种的迫害，又看到农民生活日益贫困，我深深感到这个社会非改变一下不可，但是如何改变，我却没有找到正确的答案。于是只好在极困难的条件下，抱着“科学救国”的目的埋头于自己的教学工作和科学研究工作。
    对共产党的正确认识我是在解放以后才开始的。在美国留学的时候，因为受了反共产主义宣传的影响，我不但认为共产主义对中国是不合适的，而且认为是可怕的。抗日战争以后，接触了进步青年，听到了解放区的一些情况，把共产党和国民党比较以后，我开始感到共产党比国民党好，但当时我仍然认为任何政党都是为少数人谋利益的集团，共产党一旦掌握政权以后，难免也会腐朽起来，因此对共产党尚无信心。解放以后，由于同共产党员有了直接的接触，才逐渐认识到共产党员忠于革命事业的高贵品质，实事求是的工作作风以及勇于进行批评和自我批评的精神，这才真正开始改变我对共产党的不正确的看法，而相信共产党是一个不同于一般政党的政党。接着我又参加抗美援朝、反细菌战、三反运动和思想改造运动以及许多社会活动，我的阶级觉悟进一步提高了。这时，我才认识到无产阶级是最先进的革命阶级，共产党是最先进的革命政党，中国人民只有在无产阶级和共产党领导之下，才能建设起自己的自由、幸福、富强的国家。而使我最感动的是党和国家对科学工作及科学工作者的无微不至的关怀。在旧社会，我既须设法使自己活下去，又要艰苦地为自己创造工作条件，而现在却得到了这样好的生活条件和工作条件。
    在中央发出向科学进军的号召以后，我深刻体会到，为了更好地实现党的这一号召，首先就要把过去推动自己工作的主导思想——个人主义的腐朽思想抛弃掉，而代之以无产阶级思想。特别是我年岁渐大，余年不多，应该趁精力还强健的时候，对社会主义事业多作一点贡献。加入党以后，在党的直接监督下，可以时时用共产党员的标准来检查自己，这无疑问的将会加快自我改造的速度，同时也就能使自己多为人民和国家作一些工作。因此我决心申请入党。
    但在申请入党的时候，我曾有过这样两个顾虑：第一个顾虑是过去我和群众的关系还好；入党以后，我和群众的关系是否会同以前不同，是否会疏远呢？我所以产生这个顾虑是因为在高级知识分子中，还有一部分人和党员比较疏远，他们对党员有很多顾虑。经过党组织的帮助，我才认识到所以造成这种现象，固然和一部分高级知识分子对党不够了解，不愿主动接近党员有关，但主要是有些党员不善于去团结党外知识分子，工作作风和工作方法上都有着不少缺点。因此，入党以后，只要我能主动地去团结群众，把广大群众团结到党的周围，所起的作用就会比非党员更大，和群众的关系将会更加密切。第二个顾虑是害怕入党后会议增加，将会影响自己的科学研究工作。后来了解党组织正在注意精简会议，今后会议将会大大减少。同时，过去有些会议所以开得时间长和不解决问题，主要是会前准备工作做得不好。这是可以改进的。同时，党组织也保证一个搞科学研究工作的党员把绝大部分时间放在业务工作上。从我自己来说，入党后不但不应该削弱科学研究工作，而且应该加强科学研究工作。这是我应当努力的方向。
    还有人问我，你加入党以后，是否会有人说你投机？我说我却没有这个顾虑。因为科学工作者追求真理是不顾一切的，而有这种顾虑的人是由于他们对待个人比对待真理还要看重得多。
    做一个共产党员是光荣的。但是一个人究竟能不能享有这个光荣，主要地不在外表，而在他的实际行动。我决心不断地努力，使我真正能把共产党员的崇高责任担当起来。
