Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China received three documents from the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina, sent on May 8 to the governments of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Republic of Vietnam, the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Vietnam, and the French government. The full text is as follows:

    I. Letter from the Two Chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina to the Governments of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of Vietnam

    Lord Reading, British Deputy Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and Gromyko, First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Socialist Republics, authorized by the governments of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, as representatives of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina, have met in London. A thorough study was made of various issues related to the implementation of the Geneva Accords on Vietnam. They also exchanged views on the following proposal: to reconvene a conference attended by the original participating countries of the Geneva Conference and members of the International Commission to discuss these issues.

    During the talks, they expressed concern about the current state of implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam, where the implementation of the political provisions of the Geneva Accords has not yet begun. In particular, consultations have not yet been held to discuss preparations for and the holding of free national elections in Vietnam under the supervision of an International Commission to restore the national unity of Vietnam. Therefore, there is currently a threat to the implementation of this extremely important provision of the Geneva Accords, although both sides of Vietnam have agreed to the principle of restoring national unity through free national elections.

    Before holding free national elections to restore Vietnamese unity, the two chairmen attach great importance to maintaining the ceasefire under the continued supervision of the International Commission in Vietnam. They recognize that the dissolution of the High Command of the French Union increases the difficulties of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam in performing its duties stipulated in the Geneva Accords, which are the basis of the Commission's activities, and they recognize that these difficulties must be overcome. The two chairmen believe that the authorities in both parts of Vietnam will demonstrate effective cooperation, and these difficulties will be eliminated in practice. In the interest of strengthening peace in Indochina based on the principles and provisions of the Geneva Accords on Vietnam, the two chairmen strongly urge the authorities of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of Vietnam to make every effort to implement the Geneva Accords on Vietnam, prevent any future violations of the military provisions of the Geneva Accords, and ensure the implementation of the political provisions and principles contained in the final declaration of the Geneva Conference. To this end, the authorities in both parts of Vietnam are invited to inform the two chairmen jointly or separately as soon as possible of their views on how much time is needed to begin consultations on organizing national elections in Vietnam and how much time is needed to hold the aforementioned elections as a means of achieving Vietnamese unification.

    The two chairmen noted the productive work done by the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Vietnam and strongly urge the authorities in both parts of Vietnam to provide all possible assistance to the Commission in the future in carrying out its duties stipulated in the Geneva Accords on Vietnam.

    The two chairmen will continue to consult jointly on the situation in Vietnam, and if it is necessary in view of the situation there, they will further discuss the measures that should be taken to ensure the implementation of the Geneva Accords on Vietnam, including the proposal to convene a new conference attended by the participating countries of the Geneva Conference and the members of the International Commission for Indochina.

    II. Letter from the Two Chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina to the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Vietnam

    Lord Reading, British Deputy Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and Gromyko, First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Socialist Republics, authorized by the governments of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, as representatives of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina, have met in London to discuss the implementation of the Geneva Accords on Vietnam. They have received the International Supervisory and Control Commission's letter of May 2 and the separate letter of the Commission's Canadian member on the same day.

    The two chairmen express their gratitude to the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Vietnam for its positive contribution to the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam. The two chairmen hope that the International Supervisory and Control Commission for Vietnam will continue its efforts to maintain and consolidate peace on the basis of the implementation of the Geneva Accords on Vietnam, with a view to restoring the unity of Vietnam through free national elections held under the supervision of an International Commission.

    Before holding free national elections to restore Vietnamese unity, the two chairmen attach great importance to maintaining the ceasefire under the continued supervision of the International Commission in Vietnam. They recognize that the dissolution of the High Command of the French Union increases the difficulties of the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam in performing its duties stipulated in the Geneva Accords. The Geneva Accords are the basis of the Commission's activities, and they recognize that these difficulties must be overcome. The two chairmen believe that the authorities in both parts of Vietnam will demonstrate effective cooperation, and these difficulties will be eliminated in practice. The two chairmen strongly urge the authorities in both parts of Vietnam to provide all possible assistance to the Commission in carrying out its duties.

    However, if the Commission encounters obstacles or difficulties that cannot be resolved locally, it is hoped that the two chairmen will be notified of the situation so that they can consider whether further measures need to be taken to facilitate the work of the Commission, which the two chairmen would greatly appreciate.

    The two chairmen will communicate this appeal to the International Commission to the governments of the other participating countries of the Geneva Conference.

    III. Letter from the Two Chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina to the French Government

    The two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina have made a thorough review of various issues related to the implementation of the Geneva Accords on Vietnam. They noted the following statement made by the French government, namely that as a result of the withdrawal of French armed forces from Vietnam in accordance with the provisions of Article 10 of the Final Declaration, the High Command of the French Union in Vietnam will be dissolved on April 28.

    They recognize that the dissolution of the High Command of the French Union has created problems for the International Supervisory and Control Commission that need to be given serious attention. However, they believe that the authorities in both parts of Vietnam will demonstrate effective cooperation, and these problems will be resolved in practice. They are writing to the responsible authorities in both parts of Vietnam and to the International Commission.

    However, the two chairmen believe that the continued mediation of the French government would be very helpful in resolving the aforementioned practical problems. Therefore, they hereby request the French government to discuss this issue with the South Vietnamese authorities in order to reach an agreement on measures to promote the execution of their tasks by the International Supervisory and Control Commission and the Vietnam Joint Commission.

    The two chairmen also request that the French government maintain the status quo until the aforementioned measures have been implemented.

    日内瓦会议两位主席公布关于越南问题的三个文件
    对于在越南实施日内瓦协议的问题提出重要建议
    新华社10日讯  中华人民共和国外交部收到了关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的两位主席送来的他们在五月八日致越南民主共和国政府、越南共和国政府，越南国际监督和监察委员会和法国政府的三个文件，全文如下：
    一、关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的两位主席致越南民主共和国政府和越南共和国政府的信件
    大不列颠外交副大臣里丁勋爵和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟外交部第一副部长葛罗米柯，经联合王国政府和苏联政府授权，作为关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的两位主席的代表，已经在伦敦会晤。对于履行关于越南的日内瓦协议有关的各项问题作了透彻的研究。他们并且已就下列建议交换了意见，即再度召开一个由原来的日内瓦会议的参加国和国际委员会各成员国参加的会议来讨论这些问题。
    在会谈过程中，他们对在越南履行日内瓦协议的现状表示关切，在那里日内瓦协议的政治条款的实施直到现在还没有开始。特别是还没有进行协商来讨论准备和举行在一个国际委员会的监督下的越南自由全国选举以恢复越南国家统一的问题，因此目前对日内瓦协议的这一极重要条款的履行存在着威胁，虽然越南双方都已经同意通过全国自由选举来恢复国家统一的原则。
    在举行全国自由选举以恢复越南统一以前，两位主席十分重视在越南国际委员会继续监督之下维持停战局面。他们认识到，法兰西联邦总司令部的解散增加了越南国际监督和监察委员会在执行日内瓦协议所规定的职务中的困难，而日内瓦协议是委员会活动的根据，他们并且认识到这些困难必须加以克服。两位主席相信越南两部分的当局都会表现出有效的合作，而这些困难将在实践中得到消除。两位主席本着根据关于越南的日内瓦协议的原则和条款来加强印度支那和平的利益，强烈地敦促越南民主共和国当局和越南共和国当局尽一切努力来实现关于越南的日内瓦协议，防止今后对日内瓦协议的军事条款的任何违反，并且保证履行日内瓦会议最后宣言中所载的政治条款和原则。为此，特邀请越南两部分的当局尽速共同或分别地把它们的意见告诉两位主席，即需要多少时间才能就组织越南全国选举的问题开始协商以及需要多少时间才能举行作为达成越南统一的方法的上述选举。
    两位主席注意到越南国际监督和监察委员会所作的有成效的工作，他们强烈地敦促越南两部分的当局今后在委员会今后执行关于越南的日内瓦协议中所规定的职务时给予一切可能的协助。
    两位主席将继续对越南的局势共同咨商，而如果鉴于那里的局势而有必要的话，他们将另行讨论为保证履行关于越南的日内瓦协议所应采取的措施的问题，包括关于召开由日内瓦会议参加国和印度支那国际委员会成员国参加的新的会议的建议。
    苏联外交部长  维·莫洛托夫
    大不列颠外交大臣  赛尔温·劳埃德

    二、关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议两位主席致越南国际监督和监察委员会的信件
    大不列颠外交副大臣里丁勋爵和苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟外交部第一副部长葛罗米柯，经联合王国政府和苏联政府授权，作为关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的两位主席的代表，已在伦敦会晤，讨论了关于越南的日内瓦协议的履行情况。他们已收到国际监察委员会五月二日的信件和委员会的加拿大委员同日的单独信件。
    两位主席对于越南国际监督和监察委员会对日内瓦协议在越南的履行所作的积极的贡献表示感谢。两位主席希望越南国际监督和监察委员会今后仍将进行努力，以在履行关于越南的日内瓦协议的基础上维护和巩固和平，以期通过在一个国际委员会的监督下举行的越南全国自由选举来恢复越南的统一。
    在举行全国自由选举以恢复越南统一以前，两位主席十分重视在越南国际委员会的继续监督下维持停战局面。他们认识到法兰西联邦总司令部的解散增加了越南国际监督和监察委员会在执行日内瓦协议所规定的职务中的困难。而日内瓦协议是委员会活动的根据，他们并且认识到这些困难必须加以克服。两位主席相信越南两部分的当局都会表现出有效的合作，而这些困难将在实践中得到消除。两位主席强烈地敦促越南两部分的当局在委员会执行它的职务时给予一切可能的协助。
    但是如果委员会遇到不能就地解决的障碍或困难时，希望将情况通知两位主席，以便他们考虑是否需要采取进一步的措施来便利委员会的工作的问题，两位主席对此将很感激。
    两位主席将把这一对国际委员会的吁请通知日内瓦会议的其他各参加国的政府。
    苏联外交部长  维·莫托洛夫
    大不列颠外交大臣  赛尔温·劳埃德
             1956年5月8日
    三、关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的两位主席致法国政府的信件
    关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的两位主席对于有关实施关于越南的日内瓦协议的各项问题作了一次彻底的审查。他们注意到法国政府所作的下列声明，即由于依据最后宣言第十条的规定法国武装部队从越南撤出的结果，在越南的法兰西联邦总司令部将于4月28日解散。
    他们认识到法兰西联邦总司令部的解散对国际监督和监察委员会产生了需要予以严重注意的问题。但是他们相信越南两部分的当局将表现出有效的合作，而且这些问题将在实践中得到解决。他们正写信给越南两部分的负责当局和国际委员会。
    但是两位主席认为：在解决上述实际问题的过程中，法国政府的继续斡旋会很有帮助。因此他们谨请法国政府同南越当局讨论这一问题，以便就促进国际监督和监察委员会和越南联合委员会执行其任务的措施达成协议。
    两位主席并且要求，在上述措施得到实施以前，法国政府应维持现状。
