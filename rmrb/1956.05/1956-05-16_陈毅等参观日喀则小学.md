    Chen Yi, head of the Central Delegation, Sangye Yexi, deputy head, and Zhang Guohua, acting secretary of the CCP Tibet Working Committee, visited Shigatse Elementary School on the 14th. The Young Pioneers of the school personally tied their red scarves around the necks of the guests at the school gate. The Tibetan deputy principal, Qia Bei, introduced to the guests that the school was established on the second anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and that the majority of the students are children of handicraftsmen and farmers in the suburbs of Shigatse. Including this school, there are now fifteen elementary schools in the Shigatse area, with a thousand students.
    The guests came to the classroom of Class One, which is the highest class in the school, where dozens of students were practicing Tibetan writing at their desks. Qia Bei told the guests that the children are learning Tibetan quickly, and most of the students in the class can write cursive. Zhang Guohua added that in the past, before the establishment of elementary schools here, it would take six to ten years to learn to write Tibetan. The principal also told the guests that in the second half of this year, the school will open a middle school class, and some students in this class will be directly promoted to the middle school class. Chen Yi praised the students and told Qia Bei that in the future, the Shigatse area should also establish universities, and more middle and elementary schools.
    The guests were taken to the Young Pioneers club of the school. The school established the first Young Pioneers organization in the Tibet region in April this year. The club has books, violins, harmoniums, and various toys. Qia Bei said: "There are now seventy-five members in the school, and more than one hundred and fifty students have applied to join in the past few days."
    The guests also visited the photos of the Young Pioneers' founding and the students' homework.
    After the visit, the little hosts performed the dance "Welcome Central Delegation" for the guests, and presented the delegation with gifts they had made in their spare time, as well as a letter entrusted to the delegation to be delivered to Chairman Mao. Chen Yi presented the school with gifts and gave each student a small toy made in Beijing.

    陈毅等参观日喀则小学
    中央代表团团长陈毅，副团长桑吉悦希和中共西藏工作委员会代书记张国华等人，十四日参观了日喀则小学。这个学校的少年先锋队员，在校门口亲手把自己的红领巾系在客人们的脖子上。藏族副校长恰贝向客人们介绍说，这所学校是在西藏和平解放两周年纪念日成立的，学校的学生绝大部分是日喀则市手工业工人和郊区农民的子弟。连同这所学校，现在日喀则地区共有小学十五所，学生一千人。
    客人们来到了一班教室，这是这所学校最高的一班，几十个学生正伏在课桌上练习藏文。恰贝向客人们说，孩子们学藏文学得很快，全班大部分学生都可以写草书了。张国华接着说，过去，这里没有开办小学以前，要学会写藏文要六年到十年的时间。校长又向客人们说，今年下半年，学校里要开设一中学班，这个班的一些学生要直接升到中学班去。陈毅夸奖了这些学生，并对恰贝说，将来日喀则地区还要办大学，和更多的中学和小学。
    客人们被带到学校的少年先锋队俱乐部里，这个学校在今年四月间建立了西藏地区的第一个少先队组织，俱乐部里有图书、手提琴、风琴以及各种玩具。恰贝说：“现在全校有七十五个队员，这几天又有一百五十多个学生申请入队。”
    客人们还参观了少先队建队的照片，和学生的作业。
    参观完毕以后，小主人们为客人表演了舞蹈——“欢迎中央代表团”，并且向代表团赠送了他们利用课余时间赶制出来的礼品，还有托代表团转交给毛主席的信。陈毅向这个学校赠送了礼物，并送给每个学生一个北京产的小玩具。　（新华社）
