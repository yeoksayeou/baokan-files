Rewarding the advanced and driving forward the backward is our Party and state's fundamental principle for carrying out all work. Establishing a reward system and rewarding advanced individuals is an important method of commending the advanced and motivating the backward. Currently, this system has been established in factories and mines, but not in the vast majority of state organs. According to a survey of 21 ministries under the State Council, only four ministries have a reward system and have implemented rewards for cadres. Only three ministries have occasionally rewarded cadres without a reward system. Fourteen ministries have neither a reward system nor have implemented rewards. As a result, an abnormal situation has arisen in many of our state organs: more punishments than rewards, or only punishments and no rewards. Is it that there are no advanced individuals worthy of reward in these state organs? Obviously not. Not long ago, various state organs selected a group of advanced workers, which shows that it is not that there are no advanced individuals. However, many leaders in our state organs either do not see the advanced individuals in their own organs or are unwilling to discover them. The recent process of selecting advanced workers in the various bureaus of the Ministry of Foreign Trade is a good illustration. After the ministry assigned the task of selecting advanced workers, many leaders did not actively lead the selection of advanced workers, thinking that their department had no advanced workers and should give the slots to the enterprises below! What was the actual situation? After criticizing this incorrect understanding, 48 advanced workers were selected in these units.

Some leaders of state organs emphasize that state organs are different from factories and mines, and therefore believe that the reward system can be implemented in factories and mines, but not in state organs. Indeed, state organs are different from factories and mines, but we should see that state organs and factories and mines have a common characteristic, that is, whether it is the workers in factories and mines or the staff in state organs, there are advanced and ordinary differences among them. Since this is the case, what reason is there not to reward advanced staff to motivate ordinary staff? Moreover, the problem is not only that rewarding advanced staff can motivate ordinary staff, but also that rewarding advanced staff can strengthen the connection between leaders and the masses and strengthen the leadership. Comrade Liu Shaoqi's remarks about advanced producers at the National Congress of Advanced Producers also apply to advanced workers in state organs. He said: "Under the conditions of the people's democratic system, advanced producers are not only the pioneers of the masses, but also the core of the masses and an important link between the state and the masses. Advanced producers are an indispensable part of the social and national leadership; without advanced producers, there can be no completely correct leadership." It can be asserted that the lack of a system for rewarding advanced workers in some state organs has indeed affected the formation of advanced worker teams to varying degrees, affected the connection between leaders and the masses, and affected the further strengthening of leadership. Of course, it should also be admitted that the work results of staff in state organs are very different from the production results of workers in factories and mines. The latter are very specific, with indicators and figures, and easy to judge; the former are not very specific, often cannot be measured by indicators and figures, and are difficult to judge. However, as long as there is correct leadership above and the support of the masses below, judgment can still be made. The experience of the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Agriculture in implementing awards for staff in 1954 and 1955, as well as the recent experience of many state organs in selecting advanced workers, proves that it is not only necessary but also possible to reward staff in state organs; there are only advantages and no disadvantages.

It should be recognized that the lack of rewards for staff is contrary to our Party and state's principle of commending the advanced and motivating the backward, is inconsistent with the actual situation of advanced individuals that universally exists in state organs, and is extremely unfavorable to fully发挥 the initiative and creativity of staff. Now, some state organs have begun to attach importance to the reward system for staff and are starting to formulate and improve this system, which is a good phenomenon. All state organs without a reward system should gradually establish this system, and all state organs with an imperfect reward system should gradually improve this system in the process of rewarding staff.

However, in order to ensure the smooth operation of state organs, it is not enough to only reward good people and good deeds. It is also necessary to strengthen the struggle against bad people and bad deeds. In the struggle against bad people and bad deeds, in addition to mainly adopting the method of persuasion, that is, the method of criticism and education, it is also necessary to adopt the method of disciplinary action when necessary.

In the past, we had some biases in enforcing state discipline. The main problem was that some state organs often failed to seriously deal with the serious mistakes made by some staff, especially the more responsible staff, in accordance with state discipline, either without punishment, or with too light a punishment, or with hesitation and delay. As a result, some staff, although seriously violating state discipline, have long been at large outside state discipline.

Why did this happen? On the one hand, a complete system for enforcing state discipline has not been established. On the other hand, it is also related to the unserious attitude of some leaders of state organs towards the mistakes of cadres. Some leaders of organs "love" their cadres often more than they love state discipline. They seem not to be afraid of their cadres violating state discipline, but they are afraid that state discipline will violate their cadres, and even disregard state discipline to accommodate and condone their cadres. There are also individual leaders of organs whose attitude towards the mistakes made by their cadres is no longer condoning and accommodating, but blatant cover-up. Such leaders may not even be clean themselves, so they "sympathize with each other." They try their best to exonerate and protect the cadres who made mistakes. For them, it is no longer a question of how to maintain the dignity of state discipline, but how to "protect" themselves from being sanctioned by state discipline. Obviously, such leaders should also be subject to state discipline.

Of course, the enforcement of state discipline must be carried out with a very responsible and very prudent attitude. We must never act impulsively, and we must never substitute emotion for policy. It is certainly wrong to condone and accommodate staff and disregard state discipline. It is also wrong to punish staff indiscriminately and abuse state discipline. At present, there are indeed cases of abuse of state discipline in some state organs when imposing punishment on ordinary staff. Fan Ling, a staff member of the Institute of Health Education of the Ministry of Health, who was dismissed last May and only reinstated this April, is an example of being harmed in the abuse of state discipline. Fan Ling was indeed not active enough in his work, his thinking was relatively backward, and his work style had many shortcomings; but he did not have any major faults in his work, nor did he violate state discipline, but he was subjected to the highest punishment of state discipline and was dismissed. After the victim's complaint, the Ministry of Health checked the incident and issued a circular in February this year, pointing out that the dismissal of Fan Ling was wrong and that the Institute of Health Education should withdraw its decision and reinstate Fan Ling. However, Hua Xiqing, the director of the institute, had such an unserious understanding of state discipline that he believed that staff like Fan Ling should be dismissed, otherwise it would undermine the seriousness of state discipline, so he refused to implement it for a time. And there are still people who hold the same erroneous ideas as Hua Xiqing, leading to varying degrees of abuse of state discipline. They simply do not understand that maintaining state discipline mainly depends on the staff's consciousness, on the long-term education of the Party and the state, and not on mere punishment.

Only by universally establishing a reward system and correctly enforcing state discipline can we achieve rewards and punishments, clear rewards and punishments, and maximize the initiative and creativity of staff. This will be of great benefit to improving the work of state organs, improving the work efficiency of state organs, and strengthening the guiding role of state organs in the high tide of the socialist revolution.

    赏罚分明
    表扬先进、推动落后，是我们党和国家进行一切工作的基本方针。建立奖励制度，对先进人物实行奖励，是表扬先进推动落后的重要方法。目前，在厂矿企业中已经建立了这种制度，而在绝大部分国家机关中，还没有建立这种制度。据国务院所属二十一个部的调查，有奖励制度，并且对干部实行过奖励的只有四个部。虽无奖励制度，但偶尔对干部实行过奖励的只有三个部。既没有奖励制度，又没有实行过奖励的就有十四个部。因而，在我们不少国家机关中就发生了一种不正常的情况：处分多，奖励少，或者只有处分，没有奖励。是这些国家机关中没有值得奖励的先进人物吗？显然不是，不久之前，各个国家机关都评选出了一批先进工作者，就是说明了并非没有先进人物。可是在我们的国家机关中，还有不少领导人员看不到自己机关中的先进人物，或者不愿去发现这些先进人物。最近，对外贸易部各个局评选先进工作者的过程就是一个很好的说明。当部里把评选先进工作者的任务布置下去以后，不少领导人员不积极地去领导先进工作者的评选工作，认为自己这个部门没有什么先进工作者，还是把名额让给下面的企业单位吧！实际情况怎样呢？当批判了这种不正确的认识之后，就在这些单位评选出了四十八名先进工作者。
    有些国家机关的领导人员，强调国家机关和厂矿企业部门不同，因而认为奖励制度在厂矿企业中可以实行，在国家机关中就不能实行。的确，国家机关是与厂矿企业部门不同，可是，我们应该看到国家机关和厂矿企业部门有一个共同的特点，这就是不管厂矿企业中的工人也好，机关中的工作人员也好，他们本身都存在着先进的和普通的差别。既然如此，有什么理由不去奖励先进的工作人员从而推动普通的工作人员呢？而且，问题还不仅仅在于奖励先进的工作人员，可以推动普通的工作人员，问题还在于奖励先进的工作人员，可以密切领导与群众的联系，可以加强领导的力量。刘少奇同志在全国先进生产者代表会议上关于先进生产者的一段话，也完全适用于国家机关的先进工作者。他说：“在人民民主制度的条件下，先进生产者不但是人民群众的先驱，而且成了人民群众的核心，成了国家和人民群众之间的重要纽带。先进生产者是社会和国家的领导力量的不可缺少的组成部分；没有先进生产者，也就不可能有完全正确的领导。”可以肯定地说，有些国家机关由于缺乏奖励先进工作者的制度，的确在不同程度上影响了先进工作者队伍的形成，影响了领导与群众的联系，也影响了领导力量的进一步加强。当然，也应该承认，机关工作人员的工作结果和厂矿企业工人的生产结果大不一样，后者很具体，有指标、有数字，很好评判；前者不很具体，往往不能用指标和数字去衡量，不好评判。但是，只要上面有正确的领导，下面有群众的支持，还是可以进行评判的。1954年和1955年，铁道部、农业部对工作人员实行评奖的经验，以及最近不少国家机关评选先进工作者的经验，都证明了对国家机关工作人员实行奖励不但必要，而且可能；只有好处，没有坏处。
    应该认识，对工作人员缺乏奖励，是与我们党和国家表扬先进、推动落后的方针相违背的，是和国家机关中普遍存在着的先进人物的实际情况不相称的，也是对充分发挥工作人员的积极性和创造性极不利的。现在，部分国家机关已经开始重视对工作人员的奖励制度，正在着手制定和着手改善这种制度，这是一种好现象。一切没有奖励制度的国家机关，应该逐步把这种制度建立起来，一切奖励制度还不完善的国家机关，应该在对工作人员实行奖励的过程中逐步把这种制度完善起来。
    可是，为了保证国家机关的工作顺利进行，仅仅对好人好事进行奖励是不够的，还必须加强同坏人坏事的斗争。同坏人坏事作斗争，除了主要的是采用说服的办法即批评教育的办法而外，在必要的时候还要采用纪律处分的办法。
    过去我们在执行国家纪律中是有些偏向的。主要的是有些国家机关，对有些工作人员，特别是比较负责的工作人员所犯的严重错误，往往不能严肃地按照国家的纪律处理，或者不加处分，或者处分太轻，或者犹豫不决，迟迟不给处分。以致有些工作人员，虽然严重地破坏了国家纪律，但却长期逍遥于国家纪律之外。
    为什么会发生这种情况呢？一方面是没有很完善地建立起执行国家纪律的制度。另一方面也和有些国家机关的领导人员对干部的错误采取了不严肃的态度有关。有一些机关的领导人员，他们“爱护”自己的干部往往超过爱护国家的纪律，他们似乎不怎么害怕自己的干部触犯了国家纪律，但他们却生怕国家纪律触犯了自己的干部，甚至不顾国家纪律来迁就和姑息自己的干部。还有个别机关的领导人员对自己干部所犯错误的态度，已经不是姑息迁就，而是明目张胆的包庇了。这样的领导人员，可能连本身都不干净，所以“同病相怜”，他们就为犯错误的干部竭力开脱，多方庇护，对于他们来说，已经谈不到如何维护国家纪律的尊严，而是如何“维护”自己不受国家纪律的制裁了。很明显，这样的领导人员，也应当受到国家纪律的制裁。
    当然，执行国家纪律，必须采取十分负责、十分审慎的态度，决不能意气用事，决不能以感情代替政策。对工作人员迁就姑息，置国家纪律于不顾，固然是不对的，对工作人员一味惩办，滥用国家纪律同样是错误的。而目前有些国家机关中在对一般工作人员执行处分的时候，的确存在着滥用国家纪律的事实。去年五月被开除今年四月才恢复工作的卫生部卫生教育研究所工作人员范灵，就是在滥用国家纪律中受害的一个例子。范灵确实工作不够积极、思想比较落后，作风也有不少缺点；但在工作中并没有重大过失，也没有违反国家纪律，可是他竟受到了国家纪律的最高处分，被开除了。由于受害者的控告，卫生部检查了这一事件以后，今年二月份作了通报，指出开除范灵是错误的，要卫生教育研究所收回成命，恢复范灵的工作。而这个所的所长滑锡庆对国家纪律的理解居然如此不严肃，他认为像范灵这样的工作人员应该开除，否则就有损国家纪律的严肃性，因此一度拒不执行。而抱着像滑锡庆这种错误观念，以致程度不等的滥用国家纪律的人还是有的。他们根本不懂得维护国家纪律主要靠工作人员的自觉，靠党和国家对他们长期的教育，而不能靠单纯的惩办。
    只有普遍地建立了奖励制度，同时正确地执行了国家纪律，才能作到有赏有罚，赏罚分明，才能最大限度地发挥工作人员的积极性和创造性。这对改善国家机关的工作，这对提高国家机关的工作效率，以及加强国家机关在社会主义革命高潮中的指导作用将大有好处。
