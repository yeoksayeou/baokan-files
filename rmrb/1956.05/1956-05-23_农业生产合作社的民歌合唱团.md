    Agricultural Production Cooperative Folk Song Chorus
    A folk song chorus composed of forty-three rural girls and young men was established in Nanchong City, Sichuan Province, on the evening of the 20th.
    At the founding meeting, the chorus performed songs such as the local popular folk song "Sitting Song Hall" for the guests.
    Most of the members of the chorus are members of the Gaoping Agricultural Production Cooperative in Hedong Township, a suburb of Nanchong City. Among them, six girls sang "Sitting Song Hall" in the rural part of the mass amateur music and dance performance held in Beijing last year and won an excellent award. Now, young people and children of the Gaoping Agricultural Production Cooperative have almost all learned "Sitting Song Hall" from them and some folk songs from Anhui and other provinces that they brought back.
    Before the establishment of the chorus, the members launched field singing activities in the cooperative. They sang folk songs such as "Waterwheel Song" and "Wheat Threshing Song" while transplanting rice seedlings and threshing wheat.
    The chorus plans to use slack farming time to learn and collect various folk songs from local old farmers, and recommend them to the masses through field singing activities and demonstration performances.

    农业生产合作社的民歌合唱团
    一个由四十三个农村姑娘和小伙子组成的业余的民歌合唱团，二十日晚在四川省南充市成立。
    在成立会上，合唱团为来宾们演唱了当地流行多年的民歌“坐歌堂”等歌曲。
    参加合唱团的绝大部分团员是南充市郊河东乡高坪农业生产合作社的社员。其中有六个姑娘曾在去年北京举行的群众业余音乐舞蹈观摩演出会农村部分演出中演唱“坐歌堂”，获得优秀奖。现在，高坪农业生产社的青年和少年们几乎人人向她们学会了“坐歌堂”和她们带回来的安徽等省的一些民歌。
    合唱团成立以前，团员们在社里展开了田间歌咏活动。他们一面栽秧、打麦，一面演唱“车水歌”、“打麦歌”等民歌。
    合唱团准备利用农闲时间向当地老农民学习和搜集各种民歌，通过田间歌咏活动和示范演出向群众推荐。
