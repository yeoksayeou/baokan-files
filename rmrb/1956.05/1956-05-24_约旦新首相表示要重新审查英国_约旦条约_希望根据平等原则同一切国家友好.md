Xinhua News Agency, Amman, 23rd. The new Jordanian cabinet headed by Mufti was sworn in on May 22nd.

Most members of the new cabinet are members of Mufti's previous government. Mufti's previous government resigned last December in opposition to pressure from British Imperial Chief of Staff Templer, who attempted to force Jordan to join the Baghdad Pact. In the new cabinet, Malki, who served as prime minister from 1953 to 1954, serves as deputy prime minister as well as foreign minister and education minister. Ajlouni, a senior officer of the Arab Legion, serves as minister of the interior and minister of defense. Ajlouni is participating in the government for the first time.

The new cabinet held a meeting on the same day. After the meeting, the new Prime Minister Mufti said that he intends to re-examine the British-Jordanian Treaty signed in 1948 and British financial "aid" to Jordan. He stated that the main issues he will raise with Britain during negotiations include: British financial "aid" should be used as rent for the British military bases now in Jordan, rather than as a subsidy; all British "aid" should be handed over to the Jordanian Ministry of Finance and controlled by the Jordanian Ministry of Finance, instead of being directly handed over to the Arab Legion as it is now, over which the Jordanian government has no control.

Mufti also said that he hopes to be friendly with all countries on the basis of equality. He welcomes Britain or the United States to continue to assist Jordan in developing its economy without any conditions attached.

    约旦新首相表示要重新审查英国—约旦条约
    希望根据平等原则同一切国家友好
    新华社23日讯　安曼消息：以穆弗蒂为首的约旦新内阁在五月二十二日宣誓就职。
    新内阁的多数阁员是穆弗蒂以前的政府的成员。穆弗蒂以前的政府是在去年十二月因反对英帝国参谋总长田普勒企图迫使约旦参加巴格达条约的压力而辞职的。在新内阁中，曾经在1953年至1954年担任首相的马尔基担任副首相兼外交大臣和教育大臣，阿拉伯军团的高级军官阿杰洛尼担任内政大臣兼国防大臣。阿杰洛尼是第一次参加政府。
    新内阁在当天举行了会议。新首相穆弗蒂在会后发表谈话说，他打算重新审查1948年签订的英国—约旦条约以及英国对约旦的财政“援助”。他表示，他将要向英国提出谈判的主要问题中包括：英国的财政“援助”应当作为英国现在在约旦的军事基地的租金，而不应作为一种津贴；英国的一切“援助”应当交付约旦财政部并且由约旦财政部来控制，而不应当像目前这样直接交付阿拉伯军团，而约旦政府对阿拉伯军团是没有控制权的。
    穆弗蒂还说，他希望根据平等原则同一切国家友好。他欢迎英国或者美国继续援助约旦发展经济而不附有任何条件。
