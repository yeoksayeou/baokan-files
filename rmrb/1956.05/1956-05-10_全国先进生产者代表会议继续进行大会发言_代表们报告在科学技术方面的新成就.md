Xinhua News Agency, May 9th: The National Advanced Producers' Representative Conference's speeches on the 9th fully demonstrated the rapid growth of China's technical strength and the increasing improvement of its technical level.

Geologist Wang Shimin only transferred to the geological department to study technology in 1953. He originally only had a primary school education, but after continuous hard work and study, he is now capable of leading a field team and prospecting a huge iron ore mine for the motherland.

He said that Shizitan Hydropower Station, the first large-scale hydropower station designed by China itself, will be completed and generate electricity by the end of this year. It only took two years and five months to build this power station. The representatives cheered for these achievements in science and technology in China with round after round of applause! A total of thirteen advanced producers spoke at today's meeting. In addition to the four technical personnel mentioned above, there was also Yue Shangwu, the driver of the Mao Zedong locomotive crew, who has maintained the consistent glorious achievements of the Mao Zedong locomotive, has been accident-free for more than nine years, and has safely traveled more than 820,000 kilometers, and Li Laicai, a tractor assistant from the Henan State-owned Boai Farm, who insisted on hard training after losing both legs in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and is now able to drive a tractor.
