Xinhua News Agency, May 16th dispatch: According to a Reuters London dispatch: The British Foreign Office stated on the evening of the 15th that it welcomed the Soviet Union's statement regarding the reduction of armed forces by 1.2 million. A Foreign Office spokesperson said in a pre-prepared statement: "We welcome this statement from Russia." Western countries, including the United Kingdom, have themselves taken and announced steps to reduce their armed forces. We are confident that such steps are an action toward easing international tensions.
	"However, we hope to move further forward and be able to reach an agreement on broader disarmament measures, including international supervision and control."
	"We will continue to work towards achieving this goal."
Xinhua News Agency, Paris dispatch from TASS: The Soviet disarmament statement has made a very deep impression in France.
	Agence France-Presse reported that French authorities welcomed with satisfaction the Soviet Union's decision to reduce its armed forces by 1.2 million. These individuals said: The current French government welcomes the Soviet government's decision, considering it a contribution to improving the international situation.
Xinhua News Agency, May 16th dispatch from TASS, Washington: When commenting on the Soviet government's statement on the disarmament issue, White House Press Secretary Hagerty said: "This statement would have greater significance if the Russian delegation at the disarmament conference could show great determination to accept the suggestions put forward at the conference regarding disarmament issues, especially the President's suggestion regarding aerial inspection."
	The White House spokesperson's comments cannot help but be surprising. It is well known that it is the attitude taken by the United States and its Western partners that has prevented the subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission from smoothly resolving the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons; it is the United States and its Western partners that have brought the work of the subcommittee to a standstill and have repeatedly abandoned their own disarmament proposals. Speaking of the "aerial inspection issue," it is very clear that this kind of "aerial inspection" has no relationship whatsoever with disarmament and the establishment of supervision over disarmament.

People's democratic countries' newspapers point out:
	This is an example of practical action
	Public opinion in European people's democratic countries warmly welcomes the Soviet government's statement on disarmament issues.
	Poland's "People's Tribune" said that at a time when Western countries are using various tricks to obstruct effective disarmament, the Soviet Union has set an example of how to move from empty talk to concrete action to practically solve the disarmament problem. Obviously, if Western countries also follow the Soviet example, then mankind's ideal of disarmament will begin to turn into reality. The German Democratic Republic's "Neues Deutschland" pointed out that this is convincing evidence of the Soviet Union's desire for peace. Vietnam's "People's Daily" published an article on the 16th saying that in the current relaxed international situation, the main obstacle to resolving the disarmament issue is that the governments of Western countries, especially the authorities in the United States, are still maintaining a "policy of strength." The newspaper said that as long as we compare the concrete actions of the Soviet Union and the Western countries, the people of the world will be able to more clearly recognize who is loyal to peace and who is unwilling to have peace.

British newspapers value the Soviet Union's decision
	The Soviet government's statement on disarmament issues has become the focus of attention for British newspapers. "The Western Mail and South Wales News" commented: "The fact that Russia claims to have made large-scale cuts in its armed forces is convincing proof of its sincere desire for peace, because this reduction can be considered a concrete demonstration of Russia's new confidence in the cause of peace. This reduction should be particularly welcomed because the London disarmament talks, which people had high hopes for not long ago, did not succeed."
	"The Daily Worker" wrote: "The Soviet Union is providing an encouraging example, challenging Britain, France, and the United States: if they sincerely hope to consolidate peace, they should follow the Soviet Union's example." The newspaper said that this creates "realistic conditions" for the speedy prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs.
	The Soviet government's decision on the reduction of armed forces does not suit the tastes of certain British newspapers. They do not comment on the substance of the Soviet government's statement, but rather try in every possible way to diminish the significance of the statement.

Important American figures do not want peace
	The Soviet government's statement on disarmament issues has generated obvious unease among those in the United States who profit from the continued expansion of armaments and who have a vested interest in maintaining international tensions.
	"New York Herald Tribune" commentator Lawrence admitted that public opinion believes that the Soviet Union wants peace, while the United States and its allies "are counting on military alliances."
	From news and commentary in the papers, it is clear that leading figures in the United States are unwilling to take corresponding steps on disarmament.
	"New York Times" reporter Reston believes that the United States government is unwilling to place too many restrictions on armaments because it is concerned that the Russians will undermine the Western European defense system established by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, thereby achieving their own goals. He said that people believe that one of the main dangers that exists in the current situation is that because the Soviet statement is in line with the desire of Western European countries to reduce military spending, it may lead to the gradual collapse of the defense of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

### 苏联裁军行动提供了令人鼓舞的榜样

    苏联裁军行动提供了令人鼓舞的榜样
    英法官方表示欢迎苏联裁军声明
    白宫发言人却仍在卖弄同裁军没有关系的“空中视察”
    新华社16日讯　据路透社伦敦消息：英国外交部十五日晚上表示欢迎苏联关于裁减武装部队一百二十万人的声明。外交部发言人在一个事先准备好的声明中说：“我们欢迎俄国的这个声明。”西方国家包括联合王国已经自己作出并宣布裁减它们武装部队的步骤。我们确信，这种步骤是走向缓和国际紧张局势的一个行动。
    “可是我们希望再向前进，而能就包括国际监督和管制的更广泛的裁军措施取得协议。”
    “我们将继续为实现这个目标而努力。”
    新华社据塔斯社巴黎消息　苏联裁军声明在法国产生了极深的印象。
    法新社报道说，法国权威人士满意地欢迎苏联关于裁减武装部队一百二十万人的决定。这些人士说：目前的法国政府对苏联政府的这个决定表示欢迎，认为这是对改善国际局势的贡献。
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿消息：美国白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂在评论苏联政府关于裁军问题声明的时候说：“如果俄国代表团在裁军会议上能够表现出很大的决心，来接受会议上所提出的关于裁军问题的建议，特别是总统提出的关于空中视察的建议，那么这个声明就会有更大的意义。”
    白宫发言人的评论不能不使人感到惊奇。大家知道，正是美国和它的西方伙伴所采取的态度，使联合国裁军委员会小组委员会不能顺利地解决裁减军备和禁止原子武器和氢武器问题；正是美国和它的西方伙伴使小组委员会的工作陷入僵局，并且一再地放弃了它们自己提出过的裁军建议。谈到“空中视察问题”，非常明显，这种“空中视察”同裁减军备和建立对裁减军备的监督，没有丝毫的关系。
    人民民主国家报纸指出
    这是实际行动的范例
    欧洲人民民主国家的舆论热烈欢迎苏联政府关于裁军问题的声明。
    波兰的“人民论坛报”说，在西方国家采取各种各样手腕来阻挠有效的裁军的时候，苏联做出了应当如何从空谈转到具体行动以实际解决裁军问题的范例。显然，如果西方国家也遵循苏联的范例，那么人类对裁军的理想就会开始转变为现实了。民主德国“新德意志报”指出，这是苏联渴望和平的令人信服的证据。越南“人民报”在16日发表文章说，在目前已经有了缓和的国际局势中，解决裁军问题的主要障碍是西方各国政府首先是美国的当权者仍然在保持“实力政策”。报纸说，只要对照一下苏联和西方各国的具体行动，世界人民便会更加认清谁是忠实于和平，谁是不愿意和平的。
    英国报纸重视苏联的决定
    苏联政府关于裁军问题的声明成了英国报纸注意的中心。“西方邮报与南威尔士新闻”的评论写道：“俄国声言大规模裁减武装部队这件事，令人信服地证明了它要求和平的真诚愿望，因为这种裁减可以认为是俄国对和平事业的新信心的具体证明。这种裁减特别应当值得欢迎，因为不久以前人们寄予很大希望的伦敦裁军谈判并没有获得成功。”
    “工人日报”写道：“苏联提供了一个令人鼓舞的榜样，它向英国、法国和美国进行挑战：如果它们真诚希望巩固和平，它们就应当效法苏联的榜样。”这家报纸说，这就为尽速禁止原子弹和氢弹创造了“现实的条件”。
    苏联政府关于裁减武装部队的决定，并不适合英国某些报纸的口味。它们不去评论苏联政府的声明的实质，而是千方百计想要缩小这个声明的意义。
    美国显要人物不要和平
    苏联政府关于裁军问题的声明在那些靠继续扩张军备来牟取利润和同维持国际紧张局势有利害关系的美国人士中间产生了明显的不安情绪。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”评论员劳伦斯承认，舆论界认为苏联希望和平，而美国和它的盟国却“指望着军事同盟”。
    从报纸的消息和评论中可以了解到，美国的显要人物在裁军方面不愿意采取相应的步骤。
    “纽约时报”记者赖斯顿认为，美国政府不愿意把军备作太大的限制，因为，它耽心俄国人破坏北大西洋公约组织所建立起来的西欧防御系统，从而达到他们自己的目的。他说，人们认为，目前局势当中所存在的主要危险之一就在于此，因为苏联的声明与目前西欧国家中缩减军事开支的愿望相符合，可能导致北大西洋公约组织的防御逐渐趋于崩溃。
