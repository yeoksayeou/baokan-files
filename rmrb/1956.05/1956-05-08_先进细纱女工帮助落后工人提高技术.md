Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 7th. Since more than two months ago, Feng Huiying, a Youth League group leader and fine spinning mill worker, has helped twenty-one female workers improve their skills, eleven of whom have become advanced producers. This event is being spread throughout the state-owned Zhengzhou Third Cotton Textile Factory.
　　
Feng Huiying has only been a textile worker for just over a year. This eighteen-year-old girl was the factory's advanced producer last year. In January of this year, due to the increased speed of the machines, many workers could not keep up with the technology, and her first work area failed to complete the state plan. In mid-February, she and sixteen other tending female workers signed a sister contract, determined to help everyone improve together. She learned that Wu Suzhen, who had always performed the worst in completing the plan and always failed the work method exam, had gradually lost her confidence in making progress. She patiently helped Wu Suzhen find her weaknesses and direction for effort, and constantly gave her comfort and encouragement. Now, Wu Suzhen has become an advanced producer.
　　
In April, Feng Huiying ran into a snag when helping Peng Huai, an older worker who had just come to the factory, correct his patrol route. However, she was not discouraged. She used a very sincere and humble attitude to ask Peng Huai to teach her his many years of work experience. Peng Huai was very moved and immediately told her the method of checking the "high management," and also took the initiative to propose to study the new operating methods here. A few days later, Peng Huai's patrol route was completely changed.

### 先进细纱女工帮助落后工人提高技术

　　先进细纱女工帮助落后工人提高技术
    据新华社郑州7日电  青年团小组长、细纱女工冯惠英，两个多月以来，帮助二十一个女工提高了技术，其中十一个已经成为先进生产者。这件事在国营郑州第三棉纺织厂中传扬着。
    冯惠英当纺织工人才一年多。这个十八岁的姑娘去年就是厂的先进生产者。今年一月份，由于车速加快，许多工人技术跟不上，她所在的第一工区没有完成国家计划。二月中旬，她就和十六个挡车女工订了姐妹合同，决心帮助大家共同提高。她了解到一向完成计划最差、工作法考试总是不及格的吴素珍，已经逐渐失去了上进的信心，就耐心地帮吴素珍找出薄弱环节和努力方向，并且不断地给以安慰、鼓励。现在，吴素珍已经成为先进生产者。
    四月份，冯惠英曾经在帮助刚来厂的老工人彭怀纠正巡回路线的时候，碰了钉子，但是她并不灰心，她用十分诚恳和谦逊的态度去请彭怀把多年工作的经验教给自己。彭怀很受感动，立刻把检查“高管”的办法告诉她，还主动地提出要好好学习这里的新操作法。几天以后，彭怀的巡回路线完全改变过来了。
