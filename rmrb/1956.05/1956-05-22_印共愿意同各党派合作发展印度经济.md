    Ghosh said that the Communist Party of India and the Congress Party have many consistent opinions on foreign policy.

    Regarding domestic policy, Ghosh said that the Communist Party of India generally agrees with the goals and some of the recommendations announced in the Second Five-Year Plan. However, there are also major and important differences.

    He said that the Communist Party of India has greatly different opinions from the government on the issue of raising funds for the Second Five-Year Plan. The Communist Party of India believes that the government is trying to place an excessive burden on the ordinary people while allowing the wealthier classes to evade it.

    印共愿意同各党派合作发展印度经济
    新华社新德里21日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度共产党总书记高士五月十九日在记者招待会上说，为了发展印度的经济和保证人民群众的丰足的生活，印度共产党愿意同每一个政党携手，包括执政的国大党在内。
    高士说，在外交政策上，印度共产党和国大党有很多意见一致的地方。
    关于国内政策方面，高士说，印度共产党大体上同意第二个五年计划所宣布的目标和若干项建议。但是，分歧的地方也大，而且是重要的。
    他说，印度共产党在为第二个五年计划筹措资金这个问题上同政府的意见大不相同。印度共产党认为政府企图在普通人民身上加上过重的负担，而让较富裕的阶级得以规避。
    高士说，印度共产党目前有党员十二万五千人，两年前的党员人数是九万人。
