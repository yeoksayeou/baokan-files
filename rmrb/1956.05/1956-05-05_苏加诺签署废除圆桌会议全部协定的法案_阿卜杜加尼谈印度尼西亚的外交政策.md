　　Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 4th. Indonesian President Sukarno signed into law on the afternoon of the 3rd the bill abolishing all agreements of the Round Table Conference signed with the Netherlands in 1949.

　　This bill was unanimously passed by the parliament on April 21st. With the President's signature, the bill becomes law.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 3rd. According to a report by the Indonesian News Agency, Foreign Minister Abdulkadir told the agency's reporters on May 2nd that an increasing number of young nations, such as Ceylon, Cambodia, Syria, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, are now pursuing independent foreign policies like the one pursued by Indonesia.

　　He said that there are definitely clear indications that Indonesia's view against aligning with major power blocs is gradually taking root in the hearts of the people of those countries that have already formed military blocs.

　　He pointed out that the independent policy aimed at maintaining peace was first put forward by this part of the world, which until recently had little or no say in international affairs. He said: Indonesia has believed from the beginning that this policy is the only alternative to the arms race, which will inevitably lead to war.

　　苏加诺签署废除圆桌会议全部协定的法案
    阿卜杜加尼谈印度尼西亚的外交政策
    新华社雅加达4日电　印度尼西亚总统苏加诺在三日下午签署了废除1949年同荷兰签订的圆桌会议全部协定的法案。
    这个法案是四月二十一日在国会一致通过的。随着总统的签署，这个法案即成为法律。
    据新华社雅加达3日电　据印度尼西亚新闻社报道，外交部长阿卜杜加尼五月二日对这个通讯社的记者说：越来越多的青年国家，像锡兰、柬埔寨、叙利亚、埃及和沙特阿拉伯等国家现在正在执行像印度尼西亚所执行的独立的外交政策。
    他说，肯定地还有明显的迹象表明，印度尼西亚不赞成同大国集团结盟的看法正在逐渐深入到那些已经结成了军事集团的国家的人民的心中。
    他指出，目的在于维护和平的独立政策是在最近以前在国际事务方面多多少少还没有发言权的这一部分世界首先提出的。他说：印度尼西亚从一开头就相信，这种政策是代替军备竞赛的唯一的办法，军备竞赛政策不可避免地将会引起战争。
