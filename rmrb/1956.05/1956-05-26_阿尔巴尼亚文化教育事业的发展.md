    The Albanian people, having gained freedom and independence and mastered their own destiny, are enthusiastically building socialism. Under the wise leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, and with the selfless assistance of their dear friends—the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democracies—our working people are constantly achieving successes in all aspects of economic, social, and cultural life.

    If we look back at the situation before liberation, we can better understand the great significance of the achievements we have made.

    In 1938, Albania's industry had almost no foundation, agriculture was in a medieval state, and cultural and educational life was also poor. Nearly five centuries of long-term Turkish occupation made Albania the most backward country in Europe. And during World War II, our country suffered extremely serious losses. Therefore, after liberation, when the people's power was established, the situation was not even as good as in 1938. Millions of houses were razed to the ground, bridges, ports, and mines were blown up, transportation was completely destroyed, banks and financial institutions were looted, and industry, agriculture, animal husbandry, and fruit cultivation suffered severe damage.

    Under the leadership of the Party, the Albanian people rapidly completed the task of restoring the national economy and implemented the first five-year plan for building the foundations of socialism. After the completion of the first five-year plan (1951-1955), Albania has changed from a backward agricultural country to an industrial-agricultural country.

    In the past, the state of Albania's cultural and educational undertakings was miserable. More than 80% of the population was illiterate. There were only 643 elementary schools in the whole country, and these schools could not even accommodate one-third of all school-age children. In some states in northern and eastern Albania, only sixteen boys and one girl per thousand residents could attend school. As for secondary schools, there were at most eleven in the whole country, and these schools were only open to the children of the ruling classes. In 1938, Albania had only sixty-one students studying in universities in Western European countries. And domestically, there was not a single institution of higher education. Cultural undertakings were even more bleak. There were no theaters, opera houses, cultural palaces, clubs, museums, art galleries, etc. There was no Academy of Sciences, nor associations of artists and writers. The only five libraries and seventeen cinemas symbolized the cultural life of the entire country. The activities of amateur artists were just budding, and the then regime hindered its development.

    The ruling class hoped to limit the masses to the lowest cultural level, because only in this way could the masses be manipulated by them. They were afraid of the people gaining knowledge, and afraid of the working masses improving their cultural level. Therefore, the feudal landlord-bourgeoisie tried its best to obstruct the development of some educational and cultural institutions that had just begun to be established; it prohibited and suppressed any initiatives that promoted cultural life. Their policy was to hinder the prosperous development of national culture.

    In this situation, the task of the people's revolution was to enable the working masses to receive education and enjoy culture, and to get them out of ignorance, ignorance, and illiteracy as soon as possible. After the establishment of the people's democratic regime, the Albanian Labor Party immediately adopted a firm policy in terms of culture and education. In order to train a large number of cadres to meet the needs of economic and cultural development, it was necessary to rapidly expand the cultural and educational network. Therefore, the Party and the government made every effort to meet the growing demands of the masses in culture and education.

    Starting from the first year after liberation, while healing the serious wounds of the war, important measures were also taken in the people's education cause. In the first two years, the education system was reformed, elementary education was made compulsory, and literacy work was started. During this period, Albania's old schools opened, and many new schools were also opened. From this time on, the development of culture and science was also given the same importance. The Academy of Sciences and the Writers' Association were established, and cultural palaces, reading rooms, libraries, museums, art galleries and cinemas were opened. Professional people's theaters were established, and the activities of amateur artists in drama and music were carried out and increased. Artistic creation in literature, music and painting was encouraged; the working masses participated in and enjoyed this new cultural life which was thriving for the first time. The Party and the government also paid attention to setting up cultural and educational institutions at every construction site or production center. In every rural area, even in the most remote and isolated rural areas, schools and cultural centers have been established.

    During the first five-year plan (1951-1955), many new factories, hydroelectric power stations, canals, roads, and countless houses were added in Albania, and the central network of educational and cultural institutions was also expanded. Today, Albania has the Academy of Sciences, the Historical Research Institute, the Agricultural Research Institute, the Writers' and Artists' Association, and for the first time in our country, six institutions of higher learning, thirty secondary schools, three hundred and forty-one seven-year schools, two thousand one hundred and seventy-four elementary schools, and two hundred and eighty-nine kindergartens have been established. Illiteracy among people under the age of forty has been completely eliminated.

    In the 1955-1956 school year, 190,000 students were studying in various schools, which is 3.5 times the number in 1938. The number of students studying in domestic and foreign institutions of higher learning is 32 times that of 1938. Today, we have more than 7,300 teachers in various schools, which is 4.5 times that of 1938.

    As far as other educational institutions are concerned, today there are ten professional theater troupes and various theaters, fourteen cultural centers, about 40,000 reading rooms, twelve libraries, ten museums, thirty-seven cinemas, and clubs in the army and trade unions. The "New Albania" film studio has also been established. At present, it only produces documentaries, and will soon produce feature films. The amateur artistic activities of the urban and rural working people have developed greatly. Last year, more than 5,000 groups, with approximately 62,000 members, participated in folk music observation conferences and drama performances, including workers, peasants, young men and women, students, teachers, etc. In addition to the government, trade unions and youth organizations also provide great help and special care for the development of mass culture. In the 1956 national budget, education and culture expenditure accounted for 10% of the total budget.

    The second five-year plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of Albania shows the brilliant prospects for the development of our culture and education. According to this plan, in 1960, the number of students in elementary schools, seven-year schools, and secondary schools will be no less than 249,000, an increase of 31% compared with 1955. The number of students studying in domestic and foreign institutions of higher learning will reach about 3,000, an increase of 30% compared with 1955.

    The government pays special attention to the education of the working class and all working people, will gradually strengthen night school work, and better organize correspondence schools.

    Cultural institutions will be further expanded and strengthened, the number of films will increase, and the increase in cinema audiences will be no less than 25%. Theaters in the capital and local areas will be strengthened, opera houses and ballet theaters will be established, and the number of various professional theaters will also increase.

    The development of education and cultural undertakings has improved the cultural level of the working masses. Within twelve years after the establishment of the people's power, a new intellectual class composed of children of workers and peasants has been formed. The cultural revolution is unfolding smoothly, and it has become an important part of our people's revolution.

    Promoting the development of education and culture plays an important role in strengthening the strength of the working people and the initiative of the people's masses. The main work plan put forward by the Party to the cultural circles—completing the cultural revolution, deepening culture into the masses, and creating a mass cultural construction upsurge in which all classes actively participate—is being successfully realized.

    阿尔巴尼亚文化教育事业的发展
    阿尔巴尼亚教育和文化部部长　拉·阿利雅
    获得了自由独立并掌握了自己命运的阿尔巴尼亚人民，正在热情地建设着社会主义。在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，在他们亲爱的朋友们——苏联、中华人民共和国以及各人民民主国家的无私帮助下，我国劳动人民在经济、社会和文化生活各方面正在不断地取得成就。
    如果回顾一下解放前的情况，那就可以更好地了解我们已经取得的成就的重大意义。
    在1938年，我国的工业几乎没有甚么基础，农业处于中世纪状态，而文化教育生活也是贫乏的。将近五个世纪的土耳其人的长期占领，使得阿尔巴尼亚成为欧洲最落后的国家。而在第二次世界大战中我国又受到了极其严重的损失。因此，在解放以后，建立人民政权的那个时候，甚至连1938年的情况都不如。那时千百万间房舍被夷为平地了，桥梁、港口和矿山被炸毁了，交通工具全部被破坏了，银行和财政机关被劫掠一空，工业、农业、畜牧业和果品种植业受到了严重的损害。
    在党的领导下，阿尔巴尼亚人民在解放以后迅速地完成了国民经济的恢复工作，并实行了建设社会主义基础的第一个五年计划。在第一个五年计划（1951——1955）完成以后，阿尔巴尼亚已从一个落后的农业国变成了一个工业——农业国。
    过去阿尔巴尼亚的文化教育事业状况是可怜的。80％以上的人口是文盲。全国只有六百四十三个小学，这些学校甚至还不能容纳全部学龄儿童的三分之一。在阿尔巴尼亚北部和东部的一些州里，甚至每一千个居民当中只有十六个男孩和一个女孩能够进学校。至于中学，全国充其量只有十一所，而这些学校只是为那些统治阶级的子女们开办的。在1938年，阿尔巴尼亚只有六十一个学生在西欧各国的大学里念书。而在国内，一个高等教育机关也没有。文化事业更其暗淡。没有剧场、歌剧院、文化宫、俱乐部、博物馆、美术馆等等。没有科学院，也没有艺术家和作家协会。仅有的五个图书馆和十七个电影院象征着整个国家的文化生活。业余艺术家的活动刚在萌芽，而当时的政权还阻挠它的发展。
    统治阶级希望把群众限制在最低的文化水平，因为只有这样才可以使群众受他们的摆布。他们怕人民增长知识，怕劳动群众提高文化水平。所以，封建地主——资产阶级竭力阻挠刚刚开始建立的一些教育和文化机关的发展；它禁止并压制任何促进文化生活的倡议。他们的政策就是阻碍民族文化的繁荣发展。
    在这种情况下，人民革命的任务就是要使劳动群众接受教育和享受文化，并使他们尽速脱离愚昧、无知和文盲的状态。在人民民主政权建立之后，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党在文化教育方面立刻采取了一种坚定不移的政策。为了培养大量干部，适应经济文化发展的需要，必须迅速地扩大文化教育网。因此，党和政府就尽力来满足群众愈来愈增长的在文化教育方面的要求。
    从解放后的第一年开始，在治愈战争的严重创伤的同时，也在人民的教育事业方面采取了重要措施。在头两年里，对教育制度进行了改革，小学教育改成了义务制，同时开始了扫盲工作。就在这个时期里，阿尔巴尼亚旧有的学校开课了，同时又开办了许多新的学校。从这时开始，文化和科学的发展也同样地得到了重视。科学院和作家协会成立了，文化宫、阅览室、图书馆、博物馆、美术馆和电影院都开办起来了。专业的人民剧院建立起来了，戏剧和音乐方面的业余艺术家们的活动开展并增多起来了。文学、音乐和绘画等方面的艺术创造受到了鼓励；劳动群众参与并享受了这种第一次得到繁荣发展的新的文化生活。党和政府也注意到了在每个建设工地或生产中心设立文化教育机关。在每一个农村，甚至在最遥远和最偏僻的农村，也都设立了学校和文化中心。
    第一个五年计划（1951—1955年）期间，在阿尔巴尼亚增加了许多新的工厂、水电站、运河、公路和无数的住宅，同时还扩展了教育和文化机构的中心网，今天阿尔巴尼亚已有科学院、历史研究院、农业研究院、作家和艺术家协会，第一次在我国国内建立起了六个高等学校，三十所中等学校，三百四十一所七年制学校，二千一百七十四所小学和二百八十九所幼稚园。现在四十岁以下的文盲已经全部扫除了。
    在1955—1956这个学年内，有十九万名学生在各种学校内学习，这个数目等于1938年的三点五倍。在国内和国外高等学校学习的学生的人数为1938年的三十二倍。今天我们各种学校的教师共有七千三百多人，等于1938年的四点五倍。
    就其他教育机构来说，今天有十个职业剧团和各种戏院，有一十四个文化馆，约有四万个阅览室，十二个图书馆，十个博物馆，三十七所电影院，以及军队和工会中的俱乐部等。“新阿尔巴尼亚”电影制片厂也已经建立起来了，现在它只生产纪录片，不久将出产故事片。城乡劳动人民的业余艺术活动已经有很大的发展。去年有五千个以上的团体，约六万二千名成员参加了民间音乐观摩大会及戏剧汇演，其中包括工人、农民、男女青年、学生、教师等。除了政府以外，工会和青年组织对群众文化的发展也给予很大的帮助和特别的关怀。在1956年的国家预算中，教育和文化的支出占预算总额的10％。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划，展示了我国文化教育发展的光辉远景。根据这个计划，在1960年，小学校，七年制学校和中等学校的学生将不少于二十四万九千人，比1955年增加31％。在国内外高等学校学习的学生数目，将要达到三千人左右，比1955年增加30％。
    政府特别注意工人阶级和全体劳动人民的教育，将逐步加强夜校工作和更好地组织函授学校。
    文化机构将要进一步扩大和加强，影片的数目将要增加，电影观众的增加将不少于25％。首都和地方的剧院将要加强，歌剧院和巴蕾舞剧院将要建立起来，而各种职业性的剧院的数目也要增加。
    教育和文化事业的发展，提高了劳动群众的文化水平。在人民政权建立后的十二年内，由工农子弟组成的一个新的知识阶层已经形成起来了。文化革命正在顺利地展开，它已成为我国人民革命的一个重要部分。
    促进教育和文化的发展，在加强劳动人民的力量及人民群众的积极性方面，起着重要的作用。党向文化界提出的主要工作规划——完成文化革命，使文化深入到群众中去，造成一个各阶层都积极参加的群众性的文化建设高潮——正在顺利实现。（附图片）
