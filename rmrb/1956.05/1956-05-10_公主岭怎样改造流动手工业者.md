How to Transform Mobile Handicraft Workers in Gongzhuling
    Qiao Hongcai
    In Gongzhuling City, Huai De County, Jilin Province, there are more than fifty individual mobile handicraft workers known as tin workers (making things from tin) and small stove repairers (repairing pots). These trades mainly focus on repair work, such as replacing kettle bottoms and basin bottoms, soldering kettles and buckets, repairing pots, basins, and bowls. In addition, they also manufacture some simple products. Some small stove repairers and tin workers with higher skills can also repair new and old farm tools and prepare some accessories, or produce more technically complex farm tools such as small Tianyang plows. These mobile handicraft workers are characterized by: little capital and simple tools; skillful craftsmanship, carrying a small load and running along the streets; taking the initiative to visit homes, and good service attitude. They have close ties with the masses, and most of them have regular customers. For example, Du Wenbin, a small stove repairer who has been working for more than 40 years, in the area of Zhangjiagou and Danjiawopeng in the suburbs of the city, within a radius of 20 miles, whenever he enters a village, residents from far and near bring items to him for repair. Especially during the busy farming season, they are more welcomed by farmers because they take the initiative to go to the countryside to repair farm tools for farmers.
    Based on the above characteristics, the local work team responsible for the transformation of handicrafts, paid special attention to maintaining the service characteristics of mobile handicraft workers when carrying out their work, and helped them participate in old cooperatives with the same nature. For example, mobile tin workers join the Thin Iron Handicraft Production Cooperative, and small stove repairers join the Iron Industry Handicraft Production Cooperative. After joining the cooperative, they act as mobile members, hang name tags, conduct production in the countryside, operate in a decentralized manner, adhere to old locations, and are under the unified leadership of the Handicraft Production Cooperative. Profits and losses are borne by the members themselves. At the same time, according to the age and physical strength of the members, activity areas were appropriately divided while basically maintaining the original operating bases. This not only took care of the elderly and infirm members, but also avoided the phenomenon of uneven distribution of forces.
    The advantages of this organizational form are: under the conditions of maintaining and developing the characteristics of the original mobile handicraft workers, political and ideological education can be strengthened for the mobile handicraft workers through unified leadership, and the shortcomings of individual handicraft workers such as conservatism, backwardness, selfishness, and undisciplined behavior can be gradually changed. For example, after being organized, life meetings are held every two weeks to carry out criticism and self-criticism, to check each other's business thinking and style, exchange experience, and improve service quality.
    After being organized, through close contact with state-owned commerce, cooperative commerce, and agricultural production cooperatives, mobile handicrafts can be incorporated into the state plan. Handicraft production cooperatives can make full use of their own manpower, material resources, and financial resources based on the capital situation of mobile members, and actively organize raw material supply to help mobile members solve raw material problems.
    This organizational form not only closely integrates fixed handicraft workers with mobile handicraft workers, but also expands the farm tool repair network. Many small stove repairers can not only repair general daily necessities, but also have the technology to repair and assemble farm tools. As long as they are given some training in farm tool repair and assembly technology, they can become mobile repairmen for farm tool repair stations. Carrying parts and going deep into the countryside will help farm tool repair stations expand the scope of farm tool repair. When they move around in the countryside, they can understand the new situations and new needs in the countryside. This is equivalent to adding a group of economic investigators to the cooperative, so that the cooperative can improve product specifications and quality and produce according to needs.
    Through this organizational form, labor mutual assistance and production collaboration among handicraft workers can also be carried out. For example, after small stove repairers join the ironwork cooperative, they can use the scrap iron left over from the cooperative's manufacturing of various products as raw materials. This not only reduces the difficulty of purchasing raw materials in the past, but also makes full use of the cooperative's waste products. For another example, after mobile tin workers join the thin iron cooperative, the cooperative can also organize them to participate in collaboration when the cooperative's production tasks are busy, so as to avoid having to hire a large number of temporary workers or work overtime.

　　公主岭怎样改造流动手工业者
　　乔宏才
    吉林省怀德县公主岭市有五十多个被人们称为洋铁匠（锡拉匠）和小炉匠（锯锅匠）的个体流动手工业者。这些行业主要以做修理活为主，如换壶底、盆底，焊水壶、水桶，锯锅、盆、碗等。另外，他们也制造些简单的产品。有些技术较高的小炉匠和洋铁匠，还可以修理新旧农具和配制部分配件，或生产技术较复杂的小田洋犁等农具。这些流动手工业者的特点是：资金少、工具简单；手艺巧，挑个小担沿街跑；主动上门，服务态度良好。他们跟群众联系密切，大部分都有固定的主顾。如干了四十多年的小炉匠杜文斌，在市郊的张家沟、单家窝棚一带方圆二十里地方，他每走进一个村，远近居民都把物件拿来给他修理。特别在农忙季节，由于他们主动下乡给农民修理农具，更受农民欢迎。
    根据以上这些特点，当地负责手工业改造的工作组，在进行工作的时候，特别注意保持流动手工业者的服务特点，帮助他们参加到性质相同的老合作社里去。如流动洋铁匠加入薄铁手工业生产合作社，小炉匠加入铁工业手工业生产合作社。他们入社后作为流动社员，挂上名签，巡乡生产，分散经营，固守旧点，由手工业生产合作社统一领导，盈亏由社员自理。同时，根据社员年龄大小，体格强弱，在基本上保持原有的经营据点下，又适当划分了活动地区。这样，既照顾了年老病弱的社员，又可避免力量分布不均的现象。
    这种组织形式的好处是：可以在保持和发扬原有流动手工业者的特点的条件下，通过统一领导加强对流动手工业者的政治思想教育，逐渐改变个体手工业者的保守、落后、自私自利、自由散漫等缺点。如组织起来以后，每两个星期召开一次生活会，开展批评和自我批评，互相检查经营思想、作风，交流经验，提高服务质量。
    组织起来以后，通过同国营商业、合作社营商业以及农业生产合作社的密切联系，可以使流动手工业纳入国家计划。手工业生产合作社可以根据流动社员的资金情况，充分发挥他们自己的人力、物力、财力，并且积极组织原料供应，帮助流动社员解决原料问题。
    通过这种组织形式，不仅使固定手工业者同流动手工业者密切结合，而且扩大了农具修配网。很多小炉匠不仅能修理一般生活用品，而且具有修配农具的技术，只要对他们再进行一些农具修配技术的训练，他们就可以成为农具修配站的流动修配员。他们携带部件深入农村，就会帮助农具修配站扩大农具修配范围。他们在农村流动的时候，可以了解农村的新情况和新需要。这等于给合作社增加了一批经济调查员，好让合作社据以改进产品规格质量和按需要生产。
    通过这种组织形式，还可以进行手工业者的劳动互助和生产协作。如小炉匠加入铁工社以后，就可利用社里制造各种产品中剩下的废铁边作原料。这既能减少过去自己购买原料的困难，又使社里的废品得到充分的利用。又如流动洋铁匠加入薄铁社后，社里生产任务忙的时候，也可组织他们参加协作，免得再去雇用大批临时工或加班加点。
