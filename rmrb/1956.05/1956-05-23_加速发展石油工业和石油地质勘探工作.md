Editorial: Accelerate the Development of the Petroleum Industry and Petroleum Geological Exploration

    Currently, the task before all employees of the petroleum industry and petroleum geological exploration work is to produce more petroleum to meet the needs of national economic development. This task is arduous and urgent.
    In recent years, China has made great achievements in developing the petroleum industry and petroleum geological exploration. From 1907, when China began producing petroleum, to 1948, the year before national liberation, the highest annual crude oil production in those forty-two years was only 320,000 tons, with drilling footage of only 34,000 meters. The entire country had only a few dozen geological, drilling, and oil extraction technical cadres. After the founding of New China, we developed the petroleum industry on this extremely weak foundation. After several years of effort, the old face of the petroleum industry has been completely changed. In 1956, the planned crude oil production was ten times the 1949 output, and the planned drilling footage was 10.6 times more than the total footage in the forty-two years before liberation. Geological surveying, geophysics, and structural drilling teams increased more than 21 times compared to 1950, and drilling teams increased 18 times. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the original plan was for the total output value of petroleum to increase by an average of 27% annually. According to the current estimated completion, this growth target can be exceeded.
    However, although China's petroleum industry and petroleum geological exploration have made considerable achievements in recent years, they still cannot meet the needs of national economic development. This is because the scale of China's industrial and agricultural production and capital construction is getting larger and larger, and the speed is getting faster and faster, and the demand for various types of oil will greatly increase. According to calculations, every increase of 10,000 cars requires 300,000 tons of gasoline produced from crude oil per year; every increase of 10,000 tractors requires 400,000 tons of diesel produced from crude oil per year; every increase of a 5,000-ton seagoing vessel requires approximately 25,000 tons of fuel oil produced from crude oil for every 10,000 nautical miles traveled. China is a large country, and every step forward in construction requires a large increase in various types of oil. Petroleum is the "blood of industry." Without it, machines, airplanes, cars, tractors, ships, and various engines would be difficult to operate. If the petroleum industry cannot keep up with the pace of industrial and agricultural production, it will seriously affect the development of the nation's socialist industrialization, agricultural mechanization, and national defense modernization.
    Does China have the conditions for developing the petroleum industry? Yes, because there are large amounts of natural oil reserves underground in China. In the past, some people stubbornly insisted that China was a country lacking in petroleum, even dogmatically saying that our country was a "petroleum-poor country." What is the truth? We have found the basis for vigorously developing the petroleum industry. According to exploration data obtained from the Ministry of Petroleum Industry and the Ministry of Geology, China has several million square kilometers of Paleozoic and Cenozoic sedimentary areas suitable for oil-bearing structures. More than 300 geological structures and more than 200 oil seepages have been discovered. Potentially oil-bearing areas include the Qaidam Basin, the Jiuquan Basin, the Junggar Basin, the Tarim Basin, the Turpan Basin, the Sichuan Basin, the Tibetan Plateau, the North China Plain, the Jianghuai Plain, the Songliao Plain, and parts of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces. Many areas already produce oil and gas, and some have discovered large amounts of oil and gas shows, all of which have the potential to become good oil fields. In the Karamay area of the Junggar Basin, four exploratory wells have already produced brown crude oil, and six of the remaining ten exploratory wells currently being drilled have oil and gas shows. Two drilling wells south of the Qaidam Basin are also producing oil now. China also has abundant oil shale resources for developing synthetic petroleum. In addition, many areas in China have a lot of coal suitable for oil refining. This data proves that it is possible and has broad prospects to vigorously develop the petroleum industry in China.
    We need petroleum, and we also have the conditions to develop the petroleum industry. So, what are the principles and tasks for developing the petroleum industry? In the past, and still now, it is to vigorously strengthen the exploration and exploitation of natural petroleum resources, obtain oil fields with abundant reserves, and use new methods to refine the various types of oil needed; at the same time, correspondingly and under favorable conditions, develop synthetic petroleum, accelerate and further change the backward state of China's petroleum industry, and make the development of the petroleum industry adapt to the needs of national construction and the people. The reason we want to vigorously develop the production of natural oil is not only because we have resources, but also because the production of natural oil is fast, large in quantity, and low in cost. If this is the case, why do we still need to develop synthetic petroleum correspondingly and under favorable conditions? Although the cost of synthetic petroleum is higher and not suitable for large-scale development, relying solely on the production of natural oil is far from meeting the needs, so a portion of synthetic petroleum must be produced. Some areas have inconvenient transportation but have good conditions for developing synthetic petroleum. It is appropriate and beneficial to appropriately develop synthetic petroleum.
    To achieve the task of developing the petroleum industry, the most important task at present is to continue to rapidly strengthen the technical force of petroleum geological exploration and increase the workload of petroleum prospecting and drilling. In the past six years, petroleum geological exploration work has been diligent and successful, but it still feels a bit slow. The main shortcoming is the lack of comprehensive planning for the exploration of several key oil-bearing areas, and too little comprehensive regional exploration and research work has been done, so it is not possible to master the laws of oil field discovery, resulting in poor drilling results. This lesson must be remembered in future work. At the same time, whether it is regional exploration, oil extraction, or oil refining work, it is necessary to actively learn the most advanced technology to improve exploration efficiency, increase oil extraction, increase the proportion of light oil, and increase new types of oil. At present, there are many advanced experiences in these areas. Leaders and all employees of the petroleum industry department must summarize the existing experience and promote it immediately.
    Since the task of developing the petroleum industry is very heavy, it is not enough to rely solely on the Ministry of Petroleum Industry and the Ministry of Geology. More departments need to cooperate. The machinery industry department and the metallurgical industry department should try to manufacture and supply various materials needed by the petroleum department as soon as possible to ensure that the extremely scarce petroleum workers in our country do not have to stop working due to lack of materials. The education department must pay special attention to training petroleum professionals to ensure the continuous growth of petroleum technical strength. Wherever there are petroleum enterprises and exploration tasks, the local Party committees and people's committees must care about their political life, care about and improve their material and cultural life, and urge them to ensure the timely and over-fulfillment of production tasks.
    Like other industries, although the petroleum industry in China is a new industry, even though the original foundation was weak, as long as all employees of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry work hard, as long as various departments actively cooperate in carrying out this work, as long as the people of the whole country support this work, it can grow up in a not very long period of time and fully supply the oil needed by various departments of the national economy.

    加速发展石油工业和石油地质勘探工作
    目前，摆在石油工业和石油地质勘探工作全体职工面前的任务是：生产更多的石油，满足国民经济发展的需要。这个任务是艰巨的，也是急不容缓的。
    几年来，我国在发展石油工业和石油地质勘探工作方面所取得的成绩是巨大的。从我国开始生产石油的1907年起，到全国解放前一年的1948年止，这四十二年当中，原油的最高年产量不过三十二万吨，钻井进尺仅三万四千公尺，全国的地质、钻井、采油技术干部不过数十人。新中国成立以后，我们就在这个极为薄弱的基础上发展石油工业，经过几年的努力，已完全改变了石油工业的旧面貌。1956年，原油计划产量为1949年产量的十倍，钻井计划进尺比解放前四十二年的总进尺增加十点六倍，地质测量、地球物理与构造钻井队比1950年增加二十一倍多，钻井队增加了十八倍。在第一个五年计划期间，原计划石油的总产值每年平均上涨27％，根据现在预计完成的情况看，这个增长的指标是可以超过的。
    但是，我国的石油工业和石油地质勘探工作尽管在这几年中取得了不小的成就，却仍然不能满足国民经济发展的需要。因为我国的工农业生产和基本建设的规模愈来愈大，速度也愈来愈快，需要各种油类的数量将大大地提高。按照计算的结果，每增加一万辆汽车，每年就需要三十万吨原油所生产的汽油；增加一万台拖拉机，每年需要四十万吨原油所生产的柴油；增加一艘五千吨的海轮，每行驶一万浬，约需二万五千吨原油所生产的燃料油。我国是个大国，建设事业每前进一步，需要增加的各种油料都是很多的。石油是“工业的血液”，没有它，机器、飞机、汽车、拖拉机、轮船以及各种发动机就难以开动，如果石油工业不能跟上工农业生产前进的速度，就会严重地影响国家社会主义工业化、农业机械化、国防现代化事业的发展。
    在我国有没有发展石油工业的条件呢？有的，因为在我国的地下蕴藏着大量的天然油。过去，有些人硬说中国是个缺乏石油的国家，甚至武断地说我国是“无油之国”。事实怎样呢？我们找到了大力发展石油工业的根据了。从石油工业部、地质部所获得的勘探资料看，我国有适于有储油构造的古生代和新生代的沉积面积约数百万平方公里，已发现的地质构造三百多个、油苗二百多处。可能含油的地带有柴达木盆地、酒泉盆地、准葛尔盆地、塔里木盆地、吐鲁番盆地、四川盆地、西藏高原、华北平原、江淮平原、松辽平原以及云南、贵州、广西等省的一部分地区。在许多地区已经产油、产气，有的则发现大量油气显示，都有希望成为良好的油田。在准葛尔盆地的克拉玛依地区，已经有四口探井喷出了棕色的原油，其余十口正在钻探的探井有六口有油气显示。在柴达木盆地南的两口钻井，现在也出油了。在我国发展人造石油的油母页岩资源也是丰富的。此外，我国很多地区，有很多适于炼油的煤。这些资料证明，在我国大力发展石油工业是可能的，也是有广阔前途的。
    我们需要石油，也有条件发展石油工业，那么发展石油工业的方针和任务是什么呢？过去是、现在也还是：大力加强天然石油资源的勘探和开采工作，获得储量丰富的油田，并且用新的方法炼出所需要的各种油类；同时，相应地和在有利的条件下发展人造石油，加速地、进一步地改变我国石油工业的落后状态，使石油工业的发展适应国家建设和人民的需要。我们所以要大力发展天然油的生产，不仅仅是因为我们有资源，还因为生产天然油的速度快、数量大、成本低。既然如此，又为什么还要相应地和在有利的条件下发展人造石油呢？虽然人造石油的成本较高，不宜于大量发展，但是单靠天然油的生产远不能满足需要，所以必须生产一部分人造石油。有些地区因交通不便，而又有发展人造石油的良好条件，适当地发展人造石油是应该的，也是有好处的。
    实现发展石油工业的任务，当前最主要的工作，是继续迅速地壮大石油地质勘探技术力量，加大石油普查和钻探的工作量。过去六年来，石油地质勘探工作是努力的、有成绩的，但仍感到走得有些慢，主要缺点是对几个含油重点地区的勘探工作缺乏全面规划，对综合性的区域勘探和研究工作做得太少，因而不能掌握发现油田的规律，以致钻探效果不大，在今后工作中必须记取这个教训。同时，不管是地区勘探、采油、炼油工作，都要积极地学习最先进的技术，以提高勘探效率、增加采油量、提高轻质油的比重、增加新油类品种。目前，这些方面的先进经验是很多的，石油工业部门的领导人员和全体职工，要对已有的经验加以总结，立即推广。
    发展石油工业的任务既然很重，想单单依靠石油工业部和地质部是不行的，需要更多的部门进行配合。机械工业部门和冶金工业部门，应尽快试制和供应石油部门所需要的各种器材，以保证在我国极为缺乏的石油工作人员不致于停工待料。教育部门要特别重视培养石油专业干部，保证不断地壮大石油技术力量。凡是有石油企业及勘探任务的地方，当地的党委和人民委员会，必须关心他们的政治生活，关心和改善他们的物质和文化生活，督促他们保证按时和超额完成生产任务。
    和其他工业一样，石油工业在我国虽然是新的工业，尽管原来的基础薄弱，只要石油工业部全体职工努力工作，只要各部门主动配合进行这一工作，只要全国人民支援这一工作，它就可能在不很长的时间内成长起来，充分供应国民经济各部门所需要的油料。
