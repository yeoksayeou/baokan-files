    Peking University’s Advanced Class Evaluation Committee recently made a suggestion to the University Affairs Committee to stop promoting the advanced class system. This suggestion has been supported by the President of Peking University and is to be submitted to the University Affairs Committee for discussion.
    The Peking University Advanced Class Evaluation Committee recently discussed the role of advanced classes and believes that in the current stage of teaching reform, the advanced class system has produced some side effects in students' learning and life. Some classes excessively emphasize mutual assistance in learning, inappropriately set performance targets, and create competition in learning. Some courses even have students organizing additional "small classes" after the teacher's lectures. This has caused some students to develop a dependence on others in their studies, and it affects other students' further in-depth research and learning, limiting the development of students' independent thinking abilities. In some classes, extracurricular activities are also required to be uniform, even requiring 100% participation in singing and dancing, which prevents students from fully developing their special talents in combination with their personal interests, creating a rigid and monotonous student life. The evaluation committee believes that university students mainly rely on their own independent research and thinking to learn cultural and scientific knowledge, and mutual assistance in a group can only play a supporting role.
    Since 1953, Peking University has established the advanced class system among students. It has played a positive role in implementing the educational policy of all-round development and cultivating students' collectivist spirit. The Advanced Class Evaluation Committee believes that the school has undergone great changes in all aspects. If the advanced class system is still retained, it will hinder students' improvement in learning and the development of independent working abilities. In the future, in addition to continuing to consolidate and develop all the excellent work styles cultivated in the past, this working method and organizational form of the advanced class system should not be continued.

    The Peking University Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League recently made provisions to correct the tendency of students participating in too many social activities.
    According to statistics from the Peking University Committee of the Youth League in the second half of April, there were a total of ten school-wide activities arranged for students. Normally, each student held a social work position. There are more than 2,600 student cadres in the school's Communist Party, Youth League, Student Union, department associations, and class committees. Some student cadres spend 15 to 20 hours a week participating in social activities. Among student cadres in the Department of Chinese Language and Literature, more than 71% spend more than 10 hours a week on social activities. Some student cadres are too busy to even participate in student scientific research group activities.
    With the consent of the school's Party committee and administrative leaders, the Peking University Committee of the Youth League has made new regulations on students' social activity time: student cadres should not spend more than six hours a week participating in social activities, and general students should not spend more than three hours a week. The meeting system has also been re-established. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 北京大学将停止推行先进班制度  团委会纠正学生参加社会活动过多的偏向

    北京大学将停止推行先进班制度
    团委会纠正学生参加社会活动过多的偏向
    北京大学先进班评议委员会最近向校务委员会提出建议，停止推行先进班制度。这项建议得到北京大学校长的支持，准备提交校务委员会讨论。
    北京大学先进班评议委员会在最近讨论了先进班的作用，认为先进班制度在教学改革的现阶段，已在学生的学习和生活中产生了一些副作用。有的班过分强调学习上的互助，不恰当地提出成绩指标，形成了学习上的竞赛，甚至有些课程在经过教师讲授后，学生还另开“小课”。这就使得一部分学生在学习上产生依赖思想，并且影响另一部分学生对课业进一步的深入钻研和学习，限制了学生独立思考能力的发展。在有些班级中对学生的课外活动也强求一致，甚至唱歌、跳舞也要求百分之百的参加，影响学生不能结合个人的爱好充分发展他们的特长，造成学生生活刻板、单调。评议委员会认为大学生学习文化科学知识，主要依靠个人的独立钻研和思考，集体中的互助只能起到一种辅助作用。
    北京大学从1953年以来，就在学生中建立了先进班制度。它在贯彻全面发展的教育方针，对培养学生的集体主义精神等方面起了一些良好的作用。先进班评议委员会认为，目前学校在各方面都起了很大的变化，若仍保留先进班制度，就会妨碍学生在学习上的提高，以及独立工作能力的发展。今后除继续巩固并发展过去所培养起来的一切优良作风外，先进班制度的这种工作方法和组织形式不宜继续推行。

    中国新民主主义青年团北京大学委员会最近作出规定，纠正学生参加社会活动过多的偏向。
    据青年团北京大学委员会在四月份下半月的统计，布置在学生中的全校性的活动共有十项。在平时，每个学生都担任了一项社会工作。全校有共产党、青年团、学生会、系会和班会等组织的学生干部二千六百多人，有的学生干部每周参加社会活动在十五到二十小时左右，中国语言文学系学生干部的社会活动时间每周在十小时以上的占71％以上，有的学生干部因为太忙连学生科学研究小组的活动都顾不上参加。
    青年团北京大学委员会经该校中共党委和行政领导上的同意，已对学生社会活动时间作出新的规定：学生干部每周参加社会活动时间不超过六小时，一般学生不超过三小时，并且重新规定了会议制度。（新华社）
