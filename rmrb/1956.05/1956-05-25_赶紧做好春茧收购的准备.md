    Quickly Prepare for Spring Cocoon Procurement
    Chen Chengzhong
    The spring cocoon procurement season is approaching. The spring cocoon procurement period is very short, only one month from the opening to the end of procurement. The national plan this year is to increase the number of cocoons purchased by 28% compared to last year, of which spring cocoons account for 72% of the annual purchase volume. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly prepare for cocoon collection before the season to complete the procurement task as scheduled. The main problem in the current preparation work is insufficient procurement force. Spring cocoon procurement is a crash project, requiring the mobilization of a large amount of manpower in the short term. For example, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces alone need more than 30,000 people. However, at present, rural labor has been planned, and it is difficult to mobilize a large amount of manpower. Most of the technical personnel in the original cocoon procurement have taken up other jobs, so the main business and technical personnel in various places are very lacking. One-third of the station masters trained in Zhejiang are novices; some new cocoon-collecting areas such as Shanxi and Hebei have not yet established a good leadership organization for cocoon collection, and the strength of cocoon collection institutions in some areas is not sound. In addition to the manpower problem, there is also the problem of building cocoon stoves. Because the construction task is tight, some areas have not built them up to requirements; some areas have wasted resources in the construction of cocoon stoves. For example, Zhejiang Province only needs to build more than 200 new cocoon stoves, but they built more than 180 extra. Some areas even use the construction funds for other purposes.
    In order to do a good job in the spring cocoon procurement work, the Party committees and People's Committees of various cocoon-collecting areas should strengthen their leadership in the cocoon collection work, help establish and enrich cocoon collection institutions, and equip them with cocoon drying personnel. For business and technical personnel who have done procurement work in the past but have now joined agricultural cooperatives, they should be mobilized as much as possible to participate in cocoon collection work during the cocoon procurement season. This year, new cocoon-collecting areas should pay attention to training local business and technical personnel in the procurement work. Reasonable regulations should be made for the labor remuneration of procurement staff, so that people with cocoon collection business and technology can participate in the procurement work. Areas where stoves are being built should strive to complete them as scheduled; areas where stoves have been built should measure the performance of the cocoon stoves in accordance with basic construction regulations, and prepare cocoon collection utensils according to needs. The person in charge of the procurement station and the main business and technical personnel should arrive at the cocoon collection station in advance, investigate the local cocoon production situation, and formulate a planned cocoon collection plan with organization and leadership based on the cocoon drying capacity and the principle of facilitating the sale of cocoons by silkworm farmers.

### 赶紧做好春茧收购的准备

    赶紧做好春茧收购的准备
    陈诚中
    春茧收购季节快到了。春茧收购时间很短，从开秤到收购结束只一个月。全国今年计划收购蚕茧的数量比去年增加28％，其中春茧占全年收购量的72％，因此，必须赶紧做好收茧前的准备工作，以便如期完成收购任务。目前在准备工作中的主要问题是收购力量不足。春茧收购是个突击性的工作，在短期内需要动员大量人力。如江苏、浙江两省即需要三万多人。但是目前农村劳动力有了规划，要动员大量人力有困难，原有蚕茧收购中的技术人员大部分都担任了其他工作，因而各地主要业务、技术人员都很缺乏。浙江训练的站长有三分之一是生手；部分新收茧地区如山西、河北还没建立好收茧的领导机构，有的地区收茧机构的力量还不健全。除了人力问题以外，还有修建茧灶的问题。因为修建任务紧，有些地区修建得不合要求；有些地区在修建茧灶工程中有浪费现象。如浙江省只要新建二百多付茧灶就够了，但是他们多建了一百八十多付。有的地区甚至把建灶用费用作其他用途。
    为了做好春茧收购工作，各收茧地区的党委和人民委员会，有必要加强对收茧工作的领导，帮助建立和充实收茧机构，配齐收烘人员。对过去做过收购工作而现在入了农业合作社的业务技术人员，在蚕茧收购季节，应该尽量动员出来参加收茧工作。今年新收茧的地区，在收购工作中要注意培养当地的业务技术人员。对于收购工作人员的劳动报酬应该作出合理的规定，使有收茧业务技术的人员，都能参加收购工作。正在建灶的地区要争取如期完成；已经建灶的地区，要按照基本建设规定，测定茧灶性能，并且根据需要准备好收茧的用具。收购站的负责人和主要业务技术人员应该提前到达收茧站，调查当地蚕茧生产情况，根据烘茧能力和便利蚕农出售的原则，预先制定划区收茧计划，有组织、有领导地做好春茧的收购工作。
