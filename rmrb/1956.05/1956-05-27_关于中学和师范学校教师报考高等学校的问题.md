    On the Issue of Middle School and Normal School Teachers Applying for Higher Education Institutions
    In the "Answering Readers' Questions" section of the "Readers' Letters Page" published on April 30th, it was mentioned that middle school and normal school teachers, as long as they meet the application requirements, can apply for higher education institutions. Now, because the enrollment sources of higher education institutions are relatively guaranteed, in order to maintain the existing school education, middle school and normal school teachers do not need to apply in this year's higher education institution enrollment.
    Based on the needs of national construction, the development tasks of middle schools and normal schools this year are very heavy, and there is still a shortage of more than 20,000 teachers, which needs to be resolved through various methods. There are tens of thousands of current middle school teachers who are eligible to apply for higher education institutions. If they all leave their jobs to pursue further studies, the shortage of teachers in middle schools and normal schools this year will expand. This will increase the difficulties in middle school and normal school education, affect the completion of this year's enrollment tasks, and affect the future development of higher education institutions and the popularization of compulsory primary education.
    Of course, it is good that teachers want to study in higher education institutions to improve themselves. Currently, middle school and normal school teachers have opportunities for in-service training. Education administrative departments at all levels have formulated specific plans for the in-service training of secondary school teachers, instructing local higher normal colleges and teacher training colleges to gradually increase the number of systematic correspondence and training classes, so that middle school and normal school teachers who have not graduated from normal colleges or higher normal undergraduate programs can, through in-service study, be raised to the level of normal college graduation and higher normal undergraduate graduation within a certain period. In fact, some teachers who originally had low cultural levels have already reached the level of higher education institution graduates after participating in in-service training and correspondence studies. In addition, a considerable number of outstanding teachers in middle schools and normal schools have been selected to teach in higher education institutions in recent years. This means that middle school and normal school teachers can improve themselves without leaving their jobs to pursue further studies. In the future, education departments should further improve the work of organizing in-service training for teachers, so that existing teachers can get more training opportunities and improve the quality of training, in order to meet the teachers' demands for self-improvement.

### 关于中学和师范学校教师报考高等学校的问题

    关于中学和师范学校教师报考高等学校的问题
    四月三十日“读者来信专页”发表的“有关报考高等学校的若干问题”的“答读者问”中曾经提到：中学和师范学校教师，只要符合报考条件，都可以报考高等学校。现在，因为高等学校招生来源已较有保证，为了维护现有学校教育，中学和师范教师在这次高等学校招生中可以不必报考。
    根据国家建设事业的需要，今年中学和师范学校的发展任务都很大，师资还缺少两万多人，需要采取各种办法来解决。现有中学教师有条件报考高等学校的有好几万人，如果他们都离职升学，今年中学和师范学校师资的缺额就要扩大，这将增加中学和师范教育工作的困难，影响今年招生任务的完成，影响今后高等学校的发展和普及小学义务教育的进行。
    当然，教师们要求入高等学校学习，来提高自己，这种积极性是很好的。目前，中学和师范学校教师都有在职进修的机会，各级教育行政部门已经制定了中等学校教师进修的具体计划，责成各地高等师范院校和教师进修学院，逐年增加系统的函授和进修的班次，使中学和师范学校教师中不及师范专科毕业和高等师范本科毕业程度的，通过在职学习，在一定时期内，都分别提高到师范专科毕业和高等师范本科毕业的程度。事实上，有些原来文化水平不高的教师，经过参加在职进修和函授学习，目前已经达到了高等学校毕业的水平。另外，在中学和师范学校的优秀教师中，几年来被选拔到高等学校去任教的，为数也不少。这就是说中学和师范学校教师，不离职升学同样可以得到提高的。今后教育部门还应该进一步做好组织教师在职进修的工作，使现有师资得到更多进修机会，并且提高进修质量，以满足教师们提高自己的要求。
