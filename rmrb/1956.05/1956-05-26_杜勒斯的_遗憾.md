    Dulles' "Regret"
    Cui Qi

    After the news of Egypt's recognition of China was announced, a wave of applause resounded throughout Asia and Africa. Public opinion pointed out that Egypt's decision not only conformed to the interests of the people of China and Egypt, but also conformed to the universal desire of all countries for peaceful coexistence, and therefore contributed to the cause of world peace and international cooperation.

    However, a different kind of voice came from Washington. According to American news agencies, Washington officials complained that Egypt "did not notify Washington at all beforehand." U.S. Secretary of State Dulles came out on May 22 and expressed "regret" over Egypt's recognition of China, emphasizing that the United States "does not approve" of Egypt's decision. The next day, U.S. President Eisenhower came out and said that the United States believed Egypt had made a "mistake" (!) This is really strange. Both Egypt and China are independent sovereign states. We are willing to establish diplomatic relations, so what does this have to do with the US government? Why must Egypt and China's affairs be "approved" by the United States? Whether the U.S. government is happy or not, the friendly cooperation between China and Egypt does not require the approval of the White House, just as the independence and freedom of China and Egypt does not require the approval of the White House!

    The development of friendly relations between China and Egypt is a concrete manifestation of the two countries' active implementation of the Bandung Conference resolutions. People remember that on April 27, 1955, three days after the end of the Asian-African Conference, Dulles solemnly said, "The results of the Asian-African Conference were very good," "The conference passed a number of good resolutions," and he felt "very encouraged"... But now, when the spirit of the Asian-African Conference resolutions is powerfully reflected in the development of friendly relations between Asian and African countries, Dulles is expressing "regret." There can only be one explanation for this contradictory phenomenon: on April 27, 1955, Dulles was feigning kindness; and on May 22, 1956, Dulles could no longer restrain himself and was once again putting on the airs of a blackmailer.

    Dulles' blackmail is not only aimed at Egypt, but also at other Arab countries. According to American news agencies, fearing that other Arab countries would follow Egypt in recognizing our country, the U.S. government decided to exert diplomatic pressure on these countries. The United Press International reported from Washington that U.S. diplomatic envoys in Middle Eastern countries have been ordered to indicate that the United States will express dissatisfaction with any country that follows Egypt in recognizing the People's Republic of China. As everyone knows, certain groups in the United States refuse to recognize reality, and they insist: "China does not exist!" It is, of course, their freedom to learn from ostriches and bury their heads in the sand. However, they also want to force others to do the same. They have forgotten that the era when imperialists could command obedience is long gone. The main spirit of the Asian-African Conference is that Asian and African countries will no longer allow imperialism to interfere in their affairs.

    Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser said it well: "We will never allow any country or any group of countries to plan our policies, or regard us as a sphere of influence, or order us to implement their policies." He also said: "We are willing to live in peace with anyone who is willing to live in peace with us, and we will fight against anyone who wants to oppose us." These words reflect the spirit of our times. Independence, self-determination, and peaceful coexistence are a great historical trend. The ruling groups in the United States always feel "regret" as this trend moves forward, but they ultimately have no power to stop this trend. They have already felt a lot of "regret," and there are more and greater "regrets" to come. If they continue to be stubborn, they will only suffer more setbacks.

    杜勒斯的“遗憾”
    崔奇
    埃及宣布承认中国的消息传出后，在亚非广大地区响起了一片欢迎的掌声。舆论指出，埃及的这个决定不仅符合中埃两国人民的利益，而且符合各国人民和平共处的普遍愿望，因此是对世界和平和国际合作事业的贡献。
    但是，从华盛顿却发出一种异样的声音。据美国通讯社报道，华盛顿的官员们埋怨埃及“事先根本没有通知华盛顿方面”。美国国务卿杜勒斯在五月二十二日出来说了话，他对埃及承认中国一事表示“遗憾”，他强调美国“不赞成”埃及的决定。第二天，美国总统艾森豪威尔又出来说，美国认为埃及犯了“错误”（！）这真是咄咄怪事。埃及和中国都是独立的主权国家，我们愿意建立外交关系，这同美国政府有什么相干？为什么埃及和中国的事情一定要得到美国的“赞成”呢？不论美国政府高兴不高兴，中国和埃及的友好合作不需要白宫批准，正同中国和埃及的独立自由不需要白宫批准一样！
    中国和埃及友好关系的发展，是两国积极执行万隆会议决议的具体表现。人们记得，在1955年4月27日，亚非会议结束后三天，杜勒斯曾经郑重其事地说，“亚非会议的结果非常好”，“会议通过了一批很好的决议”，他感到“很受鼓舞”……。可是现在，当亚非会议决议的精神在亚非国家友好关系的发展上有力地体现出来时，杜勒斯却表示起“遗憾”来。这个矛盾现象，只能有一种解释：在1955年4月27日，杜勒斯假冒为善；而在1956年5月22日，杜勒斯已经按捺不住，又摆出一个讹诈者的把式来了。
    杜勒斯的讹诈不仅是针对着埃及的，而且是针对着其他阿拉伯国家的。据美国通讯社透露，由于担心其他阿拉伯国家继埃及之后承认我国，美国政府决定对这些国家施用外交压力。美国国际新闻社发自华盛顿的消息说，美国驻中东各国的外交使节已经得到命令，要他们表明，美国对任何随着埃及之后承认中华人民共和国的国家都将表示不满。大家知道，美国的某些集团不肯承认现实，他们硬说：“中国是不存在的！”他们要学鸵鸟把头埋在沙里，这当然是他们的自由。可是，他们还要强迫别人也照着他们的样子做。他们忘记了，帝国主义者一呼百诺时代早已经过去了，亚非会议的主要精神就是，亚非国家再不容许帝国主义来干预它们的事务。
    埃及总理纳赛尔说得好：“我们决不允许任何国家或任何国家集团来计划我们的政策，或者把我们当作一个势力区域来考虑，或者是命令我们执行它们的政策。”他又说：“谁愿意同我们和平相处，我们也愿意同他和平相处，谁要同我们作对，我们就要同他斗争”。这些话反映了我们时代的精神。独立自主，和平共处，这是一个伟大的历史潮流。这个潮流向前进展，美国的统治集团总是感到“遗憾”的，可是他们终归没有力量阻拦这个潮流。他们已经感到了不少的“遗憾”，还有更多更大的“遗憾”在后边。如果他们仍然执迷不悟，就更要碰得头破血流。
