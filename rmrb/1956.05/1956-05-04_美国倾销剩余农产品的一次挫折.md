　　A Setback for the US Dumping of Surplus Agricultural Products
　　Li Gao
    Recently, Japan rejected a US proposal that it purchase $50 million worth of US surplus agricultural products under the so-called "Mutual Security Act" and engage in some kind of "triangular trade." This is a setback for the US in dumping surplus agricultural products on Japan under the guise of "aid." It reflects the growing resistance to the US policy of enslaving Japan.

    After the war, the US's overseas dumping of surplus agricultural products has become an important means for it to enslave some countries and打击 (attack) others. This dumping policy has aroused strong protests from many agricultural exporting countries. The US's plan this time to require Japan to conduct "triangular trade" with US surplus agricultural products was proposed in response to resistance to its dumping of surplus agricultural products in Southeast Asian countries. Its purpose is not only to get Japan to dispose of more surplus agricultural products, but also to further control Japan's foreign trade and use Japanese goods to compete for markets in Southeast Asia. The main content of this plan is that if Japan agrees to purchase this batch of agricultural products (wheat, raw cotton, tobacco, etc.), it must pay in advance. In addition to one-fifth of this amount being designated for increasing Japan's military and establishing a Japanese arms industry, the remainder will be used by the US to purchase goods in Japan and export them to Southeast Asian countries in the name of US "aid." In this way, the US cleverly turned a batch of unsalable dead stock in Southeast Asia into cheap Japanese goods that it could freely select in Japan and sell competitively in Southeast Asia; while Japan, in addition to assuming the obligation of disposing of this batch of surplus agricultural products and accelerating its arms expansion and war preparations, had to give up part of its market in Southeast Asia to the US. Not only that, but the US also set the price of surplus agricultural products very high. According to materials from the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Japan imports raw cotton from Mexico at a price of $0.3497 per pound, while the US proposed a price of $0.4122 per pound, which is 18% more expensive. In addition, according to US law, more than 50% of "aid" materials must be transported by US ships, which will take away a large amount of business from Japanese shipping merchants. Therefore, after this US plan was proposed to Japan in late February, it was not only strongly opposed by the Japanese people, but also protested by the Japanese trade and shipping industries, and some departments within the Japanese government—the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Transport, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry—also expressed dissatisfaction with it.

    What makes the Japanese people even more angry is that the US is forcing surplus agricultural products on Japan with one hand, constantly expanding its exports to Japan; while its other hand is holding the door to the US domestic market tightly shut, stepping up restrictions on Japanese goods exported to the US. After the war, Japan's trade with the US has always been in a "tragic state of imbalance," with huge deficits every year. In 1955, Japan's exports to the US increased a little, but it was still far from achieving a balance of imports and exports, and the US began to make a big fuss about it. As everyone knows, in order to obtain the maximum profit, the US monopoly capital groups have always maintained very high monopoly prices for domestic consumers; while Japanese capitalists, in order to compete in the increasingly narrow capitalist world market, have used methods such as trying their best to lower workers' wages to reduce the prices of export commodities. As a result, the prices of some Japanese export commodities (especially textiles) are very different from the prices in the US domestic market. According to Kyodo News, US companies sell cotton blouses domestically for $1.69 each; while Japanese goods sell for $0.77 each, which is more than half the price. This has created a very sharp contradiction between the US monopoly capital groups and Japan on trade issues. The US wants Japan to buy as much US cotton as possible, but is unwilling for Japan to ship goods made from this cotton to the US to sell, because even if they impose very heavy tariffs on Japanese goods, they still cannot change the disparity in prices between the two countries' goods. For this reason, they tore off the mask of "friendship" and "reciprocity" towards Japan and adopted administrative measures to restrict the import of Japanese goods. Recently, South Carolina and Alabama have both enacted laws to exclude Japanese textiles, and some other states are also preparing to take similar measures. The Japanese government protested to the US federal government to no effect. Japanese public opinion has reacted very strongly to this. The Japanese capitalists' organization, the "Chamber of Commerce and Industry," issued a statement accusing the US of unilaterally dumping on Japan and restricting Japanese trade, which has caused Japan's foreign trade to "deteriorate rapidly," and demanding that the US abide by the general rules of "if you want to buy, you must sell" and "if you want to sell, you must buy." Under the surge of public sentiment, the Japanese authorities had to take into consideration the US's request to expand the dumping of agricultural products on Japan this time.

    However, although the US's dumping plan has suffered a setback this time, its pressure on Japan will not be relaxed. In recent years, under US occupation, Japan has become the largest dumping market for US surplus agricultural products. 25% of US cotton exports, 16% of wheat, 24% of soybeans, and 54% of rice are sold in Japan. There are also more and more means of dumping, in addition to trade channels, there are also so-called "aid," "loans," "processing," and other methods. Last May and this February, the US signed two agreements with Japan under the Agricultural Products Dumping Act, requiring Japan to purchase additional US surplus agricultural products worth more than $150 million. Every agreement that the US signs with Japan is accompanied by harsh conditions, either requiring Japan to step up its arms expansion and war preparations, or requiring it to help the US compete for markets in Southeast Asia and other places. The Japanese newspaper "Hokkaido Shimbun" pointed out on March 17: The US's so-called "Mutual Security" plan "is a well-intentioned thing both politically and economically." Under the impact of US surplus agricultural products, Japan's agricultural production has been greatly affected, and more and more food and raw materials are being imported. The US is even using "forcing the Japanese to develop the habit of eating American bread and milk" ("Hokkaido Shimbun") to create Japan's dependence on US surplus agricultural products. Obviously, Japan can only get rid of this passive situation by resolutely striving for independence and autonomy.

### 美国倾销剩余农产品的一次挫折

　　美国倾销剩余农产品的一次挫折
　　李高
    最近，日本拒绝了美国提出的一个要求它根据所谓“共同安全法”承购五千万美元美国剩余农产品并进行某种“三角贸易”的计划。这是美国假借“援助”名义向日本倾销剩余农产品所遇到的一次挫折。它反映了美国奴役日本的政策受到了愈来愈大的反抗。
    战后，美国对海外倾销剩余农产品，已成为它奴役某些国家和打击某些国家的一种重要手段。这种倾销政策，已引起了许多农产品输出国的强烈抗议。美国这次要求日本以美国剩余农产品进行“三角贸易”的计划，就是在它向东南亚国家倾销剩余农产品受到抗拒的情况下提出来的。它的目的，不但在于要日本销纳更多的剩余农产品，而且是要借此进一步控制日本的对外贸易，掌握日本商品来向东南亚争夺市场。这个计划的主要内容是，日本如果答应承购这批农产品（小麦、原棉、烟叶等），必须事先付款。这笔款项除了五分之一被指定用于增加日本的军队和建立日本军火工业之外，其余全数由美国在日本采购货物，以美“援”名义输出到东南亚国家。这样一来，美国就巧妙地把一批在东南亚卖不掉的死货，变成了由它自由地在日本选购的可以在东南亚竞销的日本廉价商品；而日本则除了要承担销纳这批剩余农产品和加速扩军备战的义务之外，还要把它在东南亚的一部分市场让给美国。不但这样，美国还把剩余农产品的价格订得很高。据日本农林省的材料，日本从墨西哥进口原棉，每磅价格为0.3497美元，而美国提出的原棉价格为每磅0.4122美元，即昂贵18％。另外，依照美国法律的规定，“援”外物资必须有50％以上由美国船只来运，这又要抢去日本海运商很大一笔生意。因此，这个美国计划在二月下旬向日本提出之后，不但为日本人民所强烈反对，日本的贸易界、航运界也提出抗议，日本政府内的某些部门——通商产业省、运输省和农林省，也对它表示不满。
    日本人民更加气愤的是，美国一只手拿着剩余农产品向日本硬塞，不断扩大对日本的输出；而它的另一只手却把住美国国内市场的大门，加紧限制日本货向美国出口。战后，日本的对美贸易一直处于“悲惨的不平衡状态”，年年有庞大的入超。在1955年，日本对美输出增加了一点，但还远远没有达到出入平衡的地步，而美国就对日本大吵大嚷起来了。大家知道，美国垄断资本集团为了获取最大限度的利润，对国内消费者一直是维持着十分高昂的垄断价格；而日本的资本家们为了在日益狭小的资本主义世界市场进行竞争，就用竭力压低工人工资等办法，来降低出口商品的价格。这样，日本的某些出口商品（特别是纺织品）的价格，和美国国内市场价格相差很大。据共同社报道，美国公司在国内出售棉布女罩衫，每件为1.69美元；而日本货为每件0.77美元，便宜一半多。这就造成了美国垄断资本集团和日本在贸易问题上的十分尖锐的矛盾。美国要日本尽量多买美国棉花，却又不愿日本把用这些棉花制成的商品运到美国去卖，因为他们尽管对日本货物抽很重的关税，还是不能改变两国商品价格悬殊的情况。为此，他们就撕破对日本“友好”、“互惠”的假面具，采取行政手段来限制日本货入口。最近，南卡罗纳州和亚拉巴马州都制定了排挤日本纺织品的法律，其他一些州也准备采取同样的措施。日本政府向美国联邦政府提出了抗议也没有效果。日本舆论对此反应很激烈。日本资本家的组织“商工会议所”曾发表声明，指责美国向日本片面倾销和限制日本贸易的做法使日本的对外贸易“迅速恶化”，要求美国遵守“要买就必须卖”、“要卖就必须买”的通则。在群情激昂之下，日本当局对美国这次向日本扩大倾销农产品的要求，不能不有所考虑了。
    但是，美国这次倾销计划虽然受了挫折，它对日本的压力仍然是不会放松的。最近几年，日本在美国的占领下，已变成了美国剩余农产品的最大倾销市场。美国出口的棉花的25％、小麦的16％、大豆的24％和大米的54％，都销在日本。倾销的手段也越来越多，除了通过贸易途径之外，还有所谓“援助”、“贷款”、“加工”等等方式。去年五月和今年二月，美国就曾根据农产品倾销法案和日本签订了两次协定，使日本承购了额外的价值一亿五千万美元以上的美国剩余农产品。美国每一次同日本签订的有关协定，都附有苛刻的条件，不是要求日本加紧扩军备战，就是要它帮美国到东南亚等地去争夺市场。日本报纸“北海道新闻”在三月十七日指出：美国的所谓“共同安全”计划，“不论在政治上还是在经济上全都是些用心周到的东西”。在美国剩余农产品的打击下，日本的农业生产已受到很大影响，进口的粮食和原料越来越多。美国甚至用“强迫日本人养成吃美国的面包和牛奶的习惯”（“北海道新闻”）来制造日本对美国剩余农产品的依赖。很明显，日本只有坚决争取独立自主，才能摆脱这种被动处境。
