The China Youth Art Theater's affiliated China Children's Theater Troupe will perform two new plays starting on "June 1st": "Summer is Coming" (by Liu Houming) and "How a Little Fly Became an Elephant" (script by Zhao Xun).

"Summer is Coming" depicts the vibrant life and extracurricular activities of junior high school students, praising the collectivist spirit, mutual assistance, and friendship of Young Pioneers, as well as their excellent qualities of helping others.

In this play, the audience will see a rabbit-raising group actively rescuing vegetable seedlings and building dams for a vegetable-growing group during a storm. During the collective labor process, they educate a Young Pioneer who usually doesn't care about comrades and help a Young Pioneer who secretly hid a male rabbit correct their mistake.

"How a Little Fly Became an Elephant" is adapted from a children's story of the same name by the Soviet writer S. Sharotv. The play tells the story of a Young Pioneer who accidentally tells a lie and dares not admit it, showing that even a lie, if not corrected, will become bigger and bigger, like a small fly turning into an elephant.

The China Children's Theater Troupe is also currently rehearsing a fairy tale play "Clever Daughter-in-Law" adapted from a myth and the Soviet children's play "Mashenka." At the same time, it is preparing to stage "Malan Flower" again.

The Beijing People's Art Theater will premiere the fairy tale play "The Magic Flute" by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the founder of Czech drama, at the Beijing Theater on "June 1st."

"The Magic Flute" is a classical comedy written by the author based on ancient Czech folk legends. Through the tortuous and moving love story of the innocent and simple young bagpipe player Švanda, the author profoundly embodies the theme of the great power of sincere love for the motherland, mother, and love; vividly showing that those who have unwavering love for their motherland, mother, and lover will create miracles that have never existed in the world, and vice versa, will inevitably suffer misfortune.

"The Magic Flute" is a work loved by a wide range of adults, young people, and children in Czechoslovakia. This year is the centenary of the author's death. After today's memorial meeting, the Chinese Dramatists Association has invited the Beijing People's Art Theater to perform "The Magic Flute."

In addition, the Fujian Puppet Troupe, the Gusong Puppet Troupe, the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe No. 1, the Quyi Troupe No. 3, and others performing in Beijing will also perform for children on "June 1st."

    首都各剧团为儿童演出的新戏
    中国青年艺术剧院附属中国少年儿童剧团“六一”起将演出两个新戏：“夏天来了”（刘厚明作）和“小苍蝇是怎样变成大象的”（赵寻编剧）。
    “夏天来了”是描写初中学生朝气勃勃的生活和课外活动，歌颂少先队员的集体主义精神和互助友爱以及善于帮助别人的优秀品质。
    在这个戏里，观众将看到养兔小组在暴风雨里，积极为种菜小组抢救菜苗、修筑水坝；在为集体劳动的过程中，教育了平日不关心同志的少先队员，帮助了偷藏老公兔的少先队员改正了错误。
    “小苍蝇是怎样变成大象的”是根据苏联斯·沙洛特夫所写的一篇同名的儿童读物改编的。这个戏通过一个少先队员偶然撒了一次谎而不敢承认的故事，表现了虽然是一句谎话，如果不改正它，它就像一个小苍蝇要变成大象似的，越来越大了。
    中国少年儿童剧团最近还在排演一个根据神话故事改编的童话剧“巧媳妇”和苏联儿童剧“马申卡”；同时还准备再度公演“马兰花”。
    北京人民艺术剧院“六一”起在北京剧场公演捷克斯洛伐克戏剧奠基者约瑟夫·卡雅当·德尔童话剧“仙笛”。
    “仙笛”是作者根据捷克民族古老的民间传说写成的古典喜剧。作者通过天真纯朴年青的风笛手石万达曲折动人的爱情故事，寓意深厚地体现了真诚的热爱祖国、母亲和爱情的巨大力量的主题；形象地显示出对祖国、母亲和爱人有着忠贞不移爱情的人，是会创造出世界上从未有过的奇迹，反之，必然遭到恶运。
    “仙笛”在捷克斯洛伐克是被广大的成年人、青年人和儿童所热爱的作品。今年是作者逝世百周年纪念，中国戏剧家协会在今天的纪念会后，邀请北京人民艺术剧院演出“仙笛”。
    此外，在京演出的福建木偶剧团、古松木偶剧团及北京市京剧一团、曲艺三团等，“六一”也都分别要为孩子们演出。
