    A total of twenty-eight locally state-owned factories in Hainan Island are planned for construction and expansion this year, among which five new factories and four expanded factories have already started construction.
    The three locally state-owned sugar factories under construction will all be equipped with domestically produced new-style machines, and after completion, they can produce forty tons of sugar per day. The Ding'an Oil Pressing Factory, after completion in July this year, will be able to press 300 tons of peanuts annually. The Haikou Cannery, which will start production in June, can produce 300,000 boxes of pineapple canned goods per month.
    Some factories producing agricultural tools and fishing boats will also be expanded this year.
    Since liberation, more than forty locally state-owned factories have been newly built and restored on Hainan Island. It is estimated that the total value of local industrial production in the whole island this year will increase by more than eleven times compared with 1953.
