A scientific and technological research institute has appeared in the towering Dayao Mountains of Guangxi Province. These days, researchers at this institute are assisting Yao ethnic group members of the Liula Township Agricultural Producers' Cooperative with early rice transplanting. The rice seedlings being cultivated are the high-yielding fine variety "Dwarf Sticky" brought by the institute from Heng County. This is the first time in this area that Yao farmers have converted paddy fields into double-cropping rice fields.

This scientific and technological research institute was established last month. Its task is to systematically summarize the local people's experience in increasing production in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, combine it with scientific theory, conduct on-site experiments, and then promote it to mountainous areas. The research institute has already opened up an experimental site. Now, Yao farmers frequently come to the site to visit and observe.

The Dayao Mountains are a Yao ethnic group area. Many of the production methods of the farmers and herdsmen here are still very backward. After the basic realization of cooperativization, the cooperative members urgently requested the establishment of a scientific and technological research institute to help them improve production technology and increase yields.

    大瑶山出现科学技术研究所
    在高耸云霄的广西省大瑶山上，出现了第一个科学技术研究所。这几天，这个研究所的研究工作者，正协助六拉乡农业生产合作社瑶族社员进行早稻插秧。育秧的稻种是研究所从横县带来的产量较高的良种“矮仔粘”。在这个地区，瑶族农民还是第一次把水田改成二造稻田。
    这个科学技术研究所是在上月成立的。它的任务是有计划地总结当地群众在农、林、牧业方面的各项增产经验，结合科学理论，实地试验后推广到山区各地。研究所已经开辟了一块试验场地。现在，场地上经常接待前来参观的瑶族农民。
    大瑶山是瑶族农民聚居区。这里的农民、牧民很多生产方法还很落后。在基本实现合作化以后，社员们迫切要求建立科学技术研究所，帮助他们改进生产技术提高产量。
