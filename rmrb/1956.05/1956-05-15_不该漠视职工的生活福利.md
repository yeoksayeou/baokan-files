The state-owned Northwest Third Cotton Textile Factory recently held an employee meeting. Judging from the materials revealed by the employees at the meeting, the leaders of this factory and the Northwest Textile Administration Bureau are very unconcerned about the lives and hardships of the employees.

First, let's look at employee meals, which is one of the main issues in employee welfare. In June of last year, according to the instructions of the Northwest Textile Administration Bureau, the factory implemented "enterprise management" for the employee canteens. All wages and supplementary wages of canteen managers and cooks, as well as canteen management fees and repair costs, were borne by the employees eating in the canteen. This extra expense accounted for more than 12% of their total monthly food expenses. The management adopted the policy of "rather earn than lose," resulting in small quantities, low quality, and high prices of food in the canteen. The employees were very angry about these phenomena, saying that the employee canteen was simply a "tiger stove" (exploitative). The production area originally had three canteens, but only one was used. The day and night shift workers had to eat in the same canteen in more than a dozen batches. Often, the bowls and tables used by the previous batch had not been cleaned, and the next batch came in, making it crowded and unsanitary. Workers were afraid of being late for work, so some rushed to the canteen without even changing their clothes after shutting down their machines.

In December of last year, for some unknown reason, the Northwest Textile Administration Bureau merged the health clinics of various factories near the Third Factory into a relatively large employee hospital. The establishment of the employee hospital did not bring convenience to the employees; on the contrary, it added a lot of trouble for them to see a doctor. After the merger, patients from several factories crowded together to see a doctor, and workers had to wait at least two hours for each visit. The hospital's work hours were exactly the same as the workers' work hours. Some workers were unwilling to delay production, so they preferred to endure the pain rather than seek treatment. Many doctors in the hospital were very arrogant and had no enthusiasm for patients. Several times, after workers sent critically ill patients to the hospital, the doctors not only did not actively rescue them, but also tried every means to push the patients out the door. The hospital and employee dormitories were very close, but for the sake of "enterprise management," the hospital stipulated that the outpatient fee for workers was two yuan per visit, and three yuan for family members. However, the outpatient fee of a certain traditional Chinese medicine joint clinic two or three miles away from the factory was only forty cents.

The majority of the workers in this factory are female, and doing a good job in female hygiene is a major event directly related to production and the health of most workers. This factory paid very little attention to this issue. The production area originally had female worker hygiene room facilities, but the factory did not allow their use for the sake of "saving money". According to the survey by the maternal and child hygiene investigation team, more than half of the female workers in this factory suffered from trichomonas vaginalis, and the number of people suffering from menstrual disorders and other gynecological diseases was even greater. Running nurseries and properly solving the problem of female workers taking care of their children is an important issue to ensure that female workers can work with peace of mind and increase their work enthusiasm. This factory also has houses and some other equipment for running nurseries, but due to one-sided "savings", it has never established nurseries. Many female workers locked their children in their rooms to go to work, and they were distracted and not concentrated in their work. Some female workers had to take long-term leave to take care of their children. The weather in Xi'an area began to warm up not long before the Spring Festival, and the factory only installed heating stoves in the single dormitories. The workers said: This is like sending an umbrella after the rain.

Many things that should be done and could be done were not done, or were not done well, and many things that should not have been cancelled were cancelled. For example, after the anti-waste campaign last year, under the auspices of the Northwest Textile Administration Bureau, this factory cancelled the masks issued to workers in the preparation workshop and weaving workshop; the original four 25-watt light bulbs in the single dormitory (housing sixteen or seventeen people) were replaced with two 15-watt light bulbs. Many workers could not study in the dormitory at night.

The lack of concern for the lives and hardships of employees is also manifested in too many meetings, chaotic meetings, and unwarranted infringement on employees' cultural learning, sports, and entertainment activities. According to rough statistics, ordinary production workers in this factory have to attend at least six to eight hours of meetings per week; party and league members have to attend at least eight to ten hours of meetings per week; group leaders and workshop committee members have to attend thirteen to fifteen hours of meetings per week. Workers also have to attend more than one or two hours of "nongdang" meetings every day. Because there are too many meetings, sports activities are basically at a standstill, and employees' spare-time cultural and technical learning has also been squeezed out by more than half. The employee dormitories are very dirty and messy, and there is no time to clean them. The vast majority of employees in the factory are young men and women under the age of twenty, but no singing can be heard. Many employees' clothes are soaked in water and have become moldy, but there is no time to wash them. Some female workers cannot even find time to wash their faces when there are the most meetings.

Caring for the lives and hardships of employees is a fine tradition that every enterprise leader (including party organizations, administrative, trade unions, and youth leagues) must possess. Gradually improving the lives of employees on the basis of production development is an important way to improve their production enthusiasm. One-sided emphasis on "saving money" is undesirable, because although it saves the country some money, it dampens the production enthusiasm of employees, which is detrimental to the development of production. Therefore, at any time, we must oppose any bureaucratic style that is unconcerned about the lives and hardships of employees.

The Northwest Textile Administration Bureau bears a great responsibility for the occurrence of the above problems, especially some of the major ones. They allowed the employee canteen and employee hospital of the Northwest State-owned Cotton Third Factory to implement "enterprise management" with the principle of "rather earn than lose," and they uncritically cancelled many regulations on employee welfare that should have been preserved. At a meeting, the leaders of this bureau criticized the Third Factory for handling certain issues in a "mechanical" way, but they did not examine their own bureaucratic style. And now it is time to seriously examine and correct it.

### 不该漠视职工的生活福利

    不该漠视职工的生活福利
    朱至
    国营西北第三棉纺织厂最近召开了一次职工大会。从职工们在会上揭发的材料来看，这个厂和西北纺织管理局的领导人员对职工的生活和疾苦，是很不关心的。
    先看职工伙食，这是职工生活福利中的主要问题之一。去年六月，厂里根据西北纺织管理局的指示，对职工食堂实行“企业化”，食堂管理人员和炊事员的全部工资和附加工资、食堂的管理费和修缮费全部由在食堂吃饭的职工负担。职工负担这笔额外的开支，要占到他们每月全部伙食费的12％还多。管理人员采取“宁赚毋赔”的方针，食堂的饭菜数量少、质量低、价格昂贵。职工对这些现象非常气愤，说职工食堂简直是“老虎灶”。生产区本来有三个食堂，但只使用一个。每天昼夜两班工人要分十几批轮流在一个食堂里吃饭，往往是前一批人用的饭碗、饭桌还没擦洗干净；后一批人就进来了，既拥挤又不卫生。工人怕耽误上工时间，有些人关了车连衣服都不换就急忙往食堂跑。
    去年十二月，不知什么原因，西北纺织管理局把三厂附近各厂的卫生所合并成一所规模不算很小的职工医院。职工医院的成立并没给职工带来方便，恰恰相反，倒给职工看病增加了不少麻烦。合并以后，几个厂的病人挤在一起看病，工人看一次病起码得等候两个钟头。医院的上下班和工人上下班的时间完全一样，有些工人不愿意耽误生产，生了病宁愿忍受痛苦也不去诊治。医院的许多大夫架子很大，对病人毫无热情，有几次工人把垂危的病人送到医院以后，大夫不但不积极抢救病人，而且千方百计地把病人推出门去。医院和职工宿舍近在咫尺，为了“企业化”，医院却规定：工人的出诊费每次是两元，家属是三元。而离这个厂二、三里路远的某中医联合诊所的出诊费只是四角。
    这个厂的工人绝大部分是女工，作好女工卫生工作是一件对生产和多数工人身体健康直接有关的大事。这个厂对这一问题关心得很少。生产区本来有女工卫生室的设备，但是厂里为了“节约”，不准使用。根据妇婴卫生调查组的调查，这个厂里女工患阴道滴虫病的占全部女工半数以上，患月经病和其他妇科病的人数就更多。举办托儿所，适当解决女工带孩子的问题，是保证女工安心工作、提高她们工作热情的重要问题。这个厂也有举办托儿所的房屋和一些其他的设备，但是也由于片面的“节约”，一直没有把托儿所兴办起来。许多女工把孩子锁在屋子里去上工，工作中惦念孩子，思想不集中。有些女工为了照管孩子，竟不得不长期请假。西安地区春节前不久气候已经开始暖和了，这个厂的单身宿舍内才装上取暖火炉。工人们说：这是雨后送伞。
    许多应该办也可以办的事情没有办，或者没有办好，许多不应该取消的却取消了。例如去年反浪费以后，在西北纺织管理局主持下，这个厂把准备车间和织布车间发给工人用的口罩取消了；单身宿舍（住十六、七个人）原来四个二十五支光的灯泡换成两个十五支光的了。许多工人晚上不能在宿舍学习。
    不关心职工生活和疾苦，还表现在会议多、会议乱，毫无顾忌地侵犯职工的文化学习、体育娱乐活动时间等上面。据粗略统计，这个厂一般生产工人每周至少要参加六至八小时的会议；党、团员每周至少参加八至十小时的会议；小组长和车间委员要参加十三至十五小时的会议。工人每天还得参加一个多小时到两个小时的“弄当”会议。会议太多，体育活动基本上处于停顿状态，职工业余文化技术学习也被挤掉了大半。职工宿舍很脏很乱，没有时间清扫。厂里绝大多数职工都是二十岁以下的男女青年，但是听不到歌声。许多职工的衣服泡在水里发了霉还没时间洗，有的女工在会议最多的时候，竟连洗脸的时间也抽不出来。
    关心职工生活和疾苦，是每一个企业的领导人员（包括党组织的、行政的、工会的和青年团的）必须具备的优良作风。在生产发展的基础上，逐步改善职工生活，是提高职工的生产积极性的重要方法。片面强调“节约”是要不得的，因为它虽然为国家省了一些钱，但是挫伤了职工的生产积极性，这对生产的发展是不利的。所以，任何时候，都要反对任何不关心职工生活和疾苦的官僚主义作风。
    西北纺织管理局对上述问题特别是其中某些主要问题的发生要负很大的责任。他们听任西北国棉三厂的职工食堂和职工医院“宁赚毋赔”地实行“企业化”，他们不加分析地取消了许多职工生活福利上应该保存的规定。在一次会议上，这个局的领导人批评三厂处理某些问题的时候“机械”，但是他们没有检查自己的官僚主义作风。而现在已经是认真检查和纠正的时候了。
