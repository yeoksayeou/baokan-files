If it wasn't a picture of his sister?
    Liang Ruhai

    "Fifteen Strings of Cash" severely criticized subjectivism and has great educational significance. Everyone agrees on this. But to say that "Fifteen Strings of Cash" also promotes the exposure of other bad ideas may be unexpected, right?

    I recently read a miscellaneous essay. The author, as a League cadre, criticized his own subjectivism in a tone of self-examination. He talked about an incident concerning the recruitment of League members.

    The article wrote:

    Being a League cadre means listening to reports is a common occurrence. It is also common to arrange work, praise, and criticize based on the information heard in the reports. I never doubted the accuracy of this approach.

    However, "retribution" finally came. Once, a League group leader reported on the situation of a potential member. Talking about Zhao Zhenfei, he said that this young man's relations with women were not good recently, that he was always looking at a picture of a female comrade. And so on, the masses' reaction was not good, etc. Since this was the case, the matter of development could only be put on hold. So, during the branch committee's discussion of development work, I used this incident to reject Zhao Zhenfei.

    The next day, that silent young man came to find me. He looked very sad and said that he already knew the branch committee's opinion of him. He wanted to explain that the girl in the picture was his sister, who had just returned from the army after being demobilized. They had been apart for seven years, so he liked her very much, and every time he thought of her, he would look at the picture. As for "relations with women," he didn't know where that came from. He even challenged me: "You can investigate further, and it will be clear."

    How could I talk about "further" investigation? So I carefully learned about the situation, and what he said was true. It turned out that the group leader had taken everyone's jeering as the truth and reported it; and I took the report as the truth, so I simply affirmed it. Later, Zhao Zhenfei joined the League, but this incident left a very deep impression on me." (See the May 24th "China Youth Daily") Then the author severely criticized his own subjective and one-sided ideological shortcomings. But a series of questions couldn't help but pop up in my mind:

    1. What if the "picture of a female comrade" that Zhao Zhenfei was looking at was not actually his sister who had been "separated for seven years" and had "returned from the army after being demobilized"?

    2. What if he "looked at" a picture that wasn't of his sister, or stubbornly "always looked at" a picture of a girlfriend, or even a picture of someone he was in love with? What then?

    3. Why is it that a young man "always looking at a picture of a female comrade" means "relations with women are not good"?

    4. What if the "young man" was indeed in love?…

    One can only draw this conclusion: the League branch that our author participated in leading has a strange view: young men should not look at pictures of women; even just "looking at" pictures means relations with women are not good; young people in love – that means there is a problem with their ideology and character, and they cannot join the League, and even the entire person must be "rejected"!

    Perhaps someone will retort to me: doesn't the article say that Zhao Zhenfei "also had this and that, and the masses' reactions were not good, etc."?

    But what exactly did our poor Zhao Zhenfei do? The author didn't say. The author didn't say because he naturally thought it was unnecessary to say, thinking that looking at pictures was already enough to constitute the crime of "relations with women being not good," and the other etceteras were not as serious as this. And the author of the article, our League cadre, certainly used this most powerful example to "reject" a young man.

    When criticizing and self-criticizing, the author used very harsh words: "Even more 'excessive' than excessive persistence." This is very true, because in "Fifteen Strings of Cash," there was no expression of the feudalistic view of being excessively persistent on "relations with women," but our League cadre who is "even more 'excessive' than excessive persistence" unintentionally expressed having this view. I suspect that under his leadership, the New Democratic Youth League there might turn into a "Feudalistic Youth League." Given that in the environment mentioned in the article where that League organization is located, young people will "jeer" when they see a young man looking at pictures of women, and the leader not only has no criticism of this, but instead believes that it is justified to "jeer" at anyone who looks at pictures of women other than their sisters, then my suspicion may not be entirely superfluous.

    Does opposing bourgeois ideology and work style mean restoring the old rituals of the feudal class?

### 如果不是妹妹的照片呢

    如果不是妹妹的照片呢
    梁汝怀
    “十五贯”狠狠地批评了主观主义，有极大的教育意义，这是大家一致同意的；说“十五贯”还有促进人们暴露其它坏思想的作用，也许是意想不到的吧？
    最近看到一篇杂文，作者以团的干部的身份，用检讨的口吻，批评了自己的主观主义，他讲的是一件关于发展团员的事。
    文章写道：
    当团的干部，听汇报是常事情。往往要根据在汇报里听来的情况，布置工作，表扬、批评，这也是常事情。对这样的做法，的确从来没怀疑过它的准确性。
    但是，“报应”终究来了。有一次，团小组长汇报发展对象的情况。谈到赵振飞，他说，这小伙子最近男女关系不好，老看一张女同志的照片。还有如何如何，群众反应不好，等等。既然这样，那么发展的事情，只能等等再说了。所以在支委会讨论发展工作的时候，我用这件事情，否定了赵振飞。
    第二天，那个沉默的青年就来找我了。他样子很难过，说，他已经知道了支委会对他的意见。他要解释解释，那照片上的女孩子是他妹妹，刚从军队复员回来。他们离开了七年，所以很喜欢，每想起来，就要看看。至于“男女关系”，是不知从何说起的。他还将了我一军：“您再去调查调查，就清楚了。”
    哪里谈得到“再”呢？于是我仔细了解了一下，他说的是对的。原来那小组长，把大家的起哄当成真事，就来汇报；而我又把汇报当成真事，于是简单地肯定了。以后，赵振飞是入团了，可是这事情给我留下的印象，是极深刻的。”（见五月二十四日“中国青年报”）接着作者狠狠地批评了自己的主观、片面的思想毛病。但是，我的脑子里却不禁浮现起一串疑问：
    一、如果赵振飞看的那张“女同志的照片”竟然不是他的“离开了七年”“从军队复员回来”的妹妹呢？
    二、“看看”不是自己妹妹的照片，或者硬是“老看”一张女朋友的照片，甚至是自己恋爱的对象的照片，那又怎么样呢？
    三、为什么小伙子“老看一张女同志的照片”就是“男女关系不好”呢？
    四、万一“小伙子”确凿是在恋爱呢？………
    只能得出这样一个结论：我们的这位作者所参与领导的那个团支部有一种奇怪的观点，就是：小伙子不应该看女性照片；那怕只是“看看”照片，就是男女关系不好；青年在恋爱——就是思想、品质有问题，就不能入团，甚至于整个人都要被“否定”！
    也许有人要反驳我：文章不是说赵振飞“还有如何如何，群众反映不好，等等”吗？
    然而究竟我们的可怜的赵振飞干了些什么呢？作者没有说。作者不说，自然是认为不必说，认为看照片已经足以构成“男女关系不好”的罪状，其它等等还不如它严重，而文章作者，我们的团的干部确凿是根据这最有力的例证来“否定”一个青年的。
    文章作者在批评和自我批评的时候，采用了很严厉的话：“比过于执还‘过于执’”，此话甚是，因为在“十五贯”中没有表现过于执在“男女关系”上的封建主义观点，而我们这位“比过于执还‘过于执’”的团的干部却无意中表现了有这种观点。我怀疑在他的领导下，那儿的新民主主义青年团会不会变成“封建主义青年团”。鉴于在文章里说到的那个团组织所在的环境里，青年们见到小伙子看女性的照片就要“起哄”，而领导人对此不但毫无批评，反而认为对凡是看妹妹以外的女性的照片的人，“起哄”就是正当的，那么我的怀疑也许不完全是多余的了。
    反对资产阶级思想作风，难道就是要恢复封建阶级旧礼教吗？
