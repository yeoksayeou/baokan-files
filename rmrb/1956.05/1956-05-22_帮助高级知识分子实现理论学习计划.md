    Helping Senior Intellectuals Realize Their Theoretical Study Plans
    More than two hundred senior intellectuals in Fushun City, including engineers from mines and factories, principals of senior high schools, and physicians from hospitals, have joined the newly opened Fushun City Marxist-Leninist Night University to study philosophy and social sciences.
    This year, senior intellectuals in Fushun City have all formulated individual plans to study philosophy and social sciences and transform their thinking. In order to ensure the theoretical study of senior intellectuals, the Fushun Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has helped various factories, mines, and units to work out many specific measures to ensure that the theoretical study time of senior intellectuals is not occupied. Although these senior intellectuals have joined various theoretical study groups in enterprises and organizations, many people still missed classes due to being too busy with work and were unable to make up the lessons. Some people's learning interest was weakened because of poor study methods. In light of the specific difficulties faced by senior intellectuals in learning theory, the Fushun Municipal Committee of the CCP has also established the Marxist-Leninist Night University. In addition to inviting personnel with a certain theoretical background to give lectures, the university also selects responsible persons of factories and mines and Party committee secretaries with better theoretical knowledge to serve as tutors. The Night University also records all lectures and plays them back to students who missed the lectures.

    帮助高级知识分子实现理论学习计划
    抚顺市矿山、工厂的工程师、高级中学的校长和医院的医师等二百多名高级知识分子，都参加了最近开课的抚顺市马克思列宁主义夜大学，学习哲学和社会科学。
    今年，抚顺市的高级知识分子都制定了学习哲学和社会科学，改造思想的个人计划。中共抚顺市委为了保证高级知识分子的理论学习，曾帮助各厂矿和各单位研究出很多具体措施，保证不占用高级知识分子的理论学习时间。这些高级知识分子虽然都分别加入了企业、机关的各种理论学习班。但仍有不少人因工作太忙，缺课无法补习。有些人因为学习方法不好，减弱了学习兴趣。根据高级知识分子学习理论的具体困难，中共抚顺市委又举办了马克思列宁主义夜大学。这个大学除邀请有一定理论修养的人员讲课外，还选派理论学习较好的厂矿负责人和党委书记等作辅导员。夜大学还将每次的讲课全部录音，放给没听到讲课的学员听。
