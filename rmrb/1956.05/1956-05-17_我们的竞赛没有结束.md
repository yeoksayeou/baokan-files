    Our Competition Is Not Over
    Fei Liwen

    I.
    Shengli looked at the newly machined part, wiped the sweat from his face with the back of his hand, and sighed, "The headstock runs at 300 revolutions, but it still comes out with a fish scale pattern… Alas! Old Ox! I really don't know what to do with you." Saying this, he patted the lathe.

    "Master Sheng, the five Soviet advanced cutting techniques you taught us are really great methods! Ha, I'm doing twice as much work today!" A young worker from the hydraulic workshop suddenly walked up to Shengli and gestured excitedly, "I'm going to learn everything you taught, just like everyone else in the workshop, and catch up with you at the speed of an airplane!"

    "Catch up with me?" Shengli stopped working.

    "Yes! You completed the Five-Year Plan in three years, and now you've launched a high-speed cutting competition, which has inspired all the workers in Shanghai. You've taken the lead, and if we don't move forward at full speed, we'll become backward elements! … Let me tell you, more than half of the machinists in our workshop have learned the methods you taught."…

    "So many people again? … Catching up." After Shengli watched him leave, his mind immediately started racing. He looked at the 1,200-revolution high-speed headstock lathe he had used before. How familiar that lathe was! In the past two years, he had created and improved nearly forty tools and operating methods on it, surpassing the time and completing five years' worth of work in less than three years, firing the opening salvo. It was also on this lathe that he learned various Soviet advanced experiences and taught them to his fellow workers inside and outside the factory, igniting everyone's enthusiasm for learning advanced techniques. He also clearly remembered that a little over two months ago, it was on this lathe that he first used a cutting speed of 555 meters per minute, setting a new city record and inspiring the entire city of Shanghai to launch a high-speed cutting competition. … Alas! Everyone is inspired, and every day hundreds and thousands of people are catching up with me and surpassing you. The newspapers and radio stations are going crazy! First, Fu Mingkun emerges, then Chen Genrong emerges, and even Li Jinbiao, a returned overseas Chinese whom I used to help, has surpassed me and set a new city record. But what about me, Shengli? I happened to be transferred to another lathe at this time, and like the lathe, I became an old ox, stuck at a cutting speed of 100 meters per minute…

    Thinking of this, Shengli looked at the slogans "Learn from Shengli" that were still plastered all over the workshop and bit his lip, saying, "Why did the leadership have to transfer me to another lathe? … I'll go talk to them. What will happen if this continues!" Saying this, he started to walk.

    But after taking only one step, he turned back, blaming himself: "What's wrong with you? … The leadership has said several times that the reason for transferring me to another lathe is that the production task has increased, and this Limen lathe has become crucial, so a senior technician must be transferred to support it. … Isn't the purpose of our launching the competition to improve production? … Are you only thinking of yourself? Is he also being bureaucratic? Who should be assigned to the Limen lathe? Are we going to ignore the production task for the sake of setting records? … Is the title of labor model supposed to be worn by people who are only thinking of themselves?" Thinking this, his face turned red, and he quickly picked up the work drawings and squatted down.

    "I've thought of a lot of ideas, but the headstock can't be made any faster!" Shengli stared at the long lathe in front of him for a long time, then suddenly frowned and said, "Hmm? Why can't this sturdy lathe be made faster? … That's right! I have to find a way to turn it into a high-speed headstock!" Shengli happily stood up, but after a while, he sighed again, "How can I modify it? … Will the Power Equipment Department agree to modify the lathe?"…

    Just then, someone gently patted Shengli on the shoulder and said, "Old Sheng, why are you sighing?"

    Shengli turned around and saw that it was Factory Director Ai.

    Factory Director Ai looked up and down at this short, sturdy, round-faced cutting expert and smiled, "Your主任 told me. Ha, it was the right thing to do to transfer a key person like you to this key lathe. A labor model? It's forged in the struggle with key problems. … Old Sheng, being a labor model is not easy! You have to take the lead and catch up. When people talk about it, they always describe advanced figures as if they were born as iron-clad, steel-cast heroes. … In fact, like everyone else, when they receive difficult tasks, they also have ideological conflicts and mood swings. But the reason why they can become heroes is because they can walk ahead of everyone, sweep away these obstacles, and move forward step by step. … What? Did you get emotional after being transferred to this factory's famous old ox lathe?" Saying this, he patted Shengli again.

    "Hmm." Shengli's face turned red. He touched the drawings in his hand and looked at the factory director's face, as if his thoughts had been seen through by his eyes. After a while, he lowered his head unnaturally and said in a low voice, "A little."

    "Ha, it's good to be honest. What to do? Can't let it stay in your head for long! … The machinists in Shanghai are competing fiercely. You can't let up, as the one who took the lead."

    "I'm thinking of ideas, trying to turn this old ox into a high-speed headstock."…

    "Oh! Good." Factory Director Ai interrupted Shengli and said, "You're doing the right thing. Every lathe should be turned into an airplane, and every lathe should produce a model worker. Have you come up with an idea?"

    "I think if the horsepower of this lathe can be increased and the headstock can be made faster, won't the work be done faster? … But I'm afraid the Power Equipment Department won't agree to the modification."

    "Ha, strike while the iron is hot. It's a good idea. Everyone should agree and support it." Factory Director Ai waved his hand and said, "Okay, you first use your brains to draw a diagram, and I'll talk to your主任 now and ask him to organize people to help you. The Power Equipment Department? Leave it to me! Does this count as support? … Ha, the rest is up to you!"

    Shengli looked at the factory director's retreating figure, feeling a sudden surge of heat throughout his body. He took a few steps, patted the lathe, and muttered, "Hey! Old Ox, you're going to have your bones changed and your body replaced." Saying this, he buried his head and worked hard.

    II.

    On Saturday morning, Shengli strode towards his workshop.

    The rising sun shone on his cheeks, making them particularly red. As he walked, he couldn't hide the smile on his face. He had been looking forward to this for so many days! He never thought that the old ox would become a high-speed headstock.

    He remembered that almost a month ago, after he worked late into the night to draw that crooked sketch, Factory Director Ai personally supervised it, and the Power Equipment Department quickly sent technicians to modify it many times based on the opinions he had put forward. They finally decided to reduce the oil pump pressure of the machine tool; at the same time, they adjusted the pulley and increased the horsepower to increase the speed of the headstock. Now, after the repairmen rushed to repair it during the Spring Festival holiday, the headstock speed has actually been transformed from 300 revolutions to 820 revolutions. Now is the time to test the increased cutting speed.

    Thinking of this, Shengli breathed a sigh of relief and chuckled softly.

    Walking into the workshop, Zhang Xibao, the union production committee member, was already waiting there. As soon as he saw Shengli, he shouted, "Old Sheng! You have to test it quickly! The Steam Turbine Factory has produced another Song Wanqing! Hey! He's only a third-grade worker, but he's actually created a new record of 1,055 meters!"

    "Oh! So high? Doesn't that mean even Chen Genrong, who held the record of over 700 meters, has been overthrown! … And he's just a third-grade worker?"

    "Of course, everyone has been overthrown. … Well, things are changing every day now. Let me tell you, some keen-eared news reporters have already heard about your modified lathe and are coming to see your new record!"

    "Things are really changing fast!" Shengli patted the lathe.

    A large group of people was crowded around the lathe.

    The headstock was spinning rapidly. Shengli's forehead was sweating, and his eyes were fixed on the workpiece. He vigorously rocked the tool post, and the cemented carbide tool on the tool post made a "hiss, hiss" sound as it touched the workpiece. The iron filings, which turned from blue to purple, shot several feet high like arrows; the cut workpiece shone like a mirror. Everyone's eyes, whether near or far, were focused on the small tool tip, and as they watched, before half of the workpiece was machined, smoke was already coming out of the tool tip.

    "No! Quickly pull it away, the tool is burning again." Zhang Xibao shouted in an urgent voice.

    As Shengli turned off the machine, everyone present sighed in unison.

    Three cutting tools with burnt tips had already been placed next to the lathe. Shengli looked down at the cutting tool he had removed, which seemed to weigh several pounds in his hand.

    "Alas! It's really a headache. It was cutting so well, but it burned again."

    "And it all burned in the same place."

    The crowd became noisy, discussing one after another.

    Several news reporters looked at each other, whispered for a while, and walked to Shengli's side.

    "Comrade Shengli, now you're trying 1,287 meters per minute, but the tool can't withstand the burning. However, didn't you just create a record of more than 1,060 meters, which has surpassed Song Wanqing? Do you agree to send out this news?"

    "I don't agree. What's the point of a new record if the tool is burnt? … Is the experiment just for surpassing someone? We're competing, not competing against each other. … What's the problem?"

    The next day, on the factory's holiday, Peng Yuzhen deliberately took the children outside to play so that her husband, Shengli, could get a good night's sleep. When she left, she saw him snoring with her own eyes; however, when she took a short circle and rushed back, there was not even a shadow of a person in the room. Peng Yuzhen stomped her feet in anger.

    In fact, Shengli's mind was full of thoughts and he didn't fall asleep at all. As soon as Peng Yuzhen stepped out the door, Shengli put on his clothes and sneaked to Zhang Xibao's house through the back door.

    Zhang Xibao was pacing back and forth in the room with his hands behind his back. When he turned his face and saw Shengli, he said, "Why did you come so late? You've made me anxious."

    "My wife! Alas, I really can't do anything with her. … Okay, let's not talk about her. Have you found the problem?" Shengli scratched his hair and walked to Zhang Xibao's side.

    "It would be good if I could find it! … Hmm, it was cutting so well, and the new record ran away just as it was about to be reached." Zhang Xibao patted the table.

    "Don't be obsessed with the new record now, finding the problem is important. … Is the tool angle ground incorrectly?"

    "As soon as I got the tool, I personally checked it and proofread it with the Soviet advanced experience. There was nothing wrong with it. If you don't believe me, I have the materials here, you can take them and have a look." Zhang Xibao paced around the room again with his hands behind his back.

    "Then what's the problem?" Shengli also paced around.

    The two of them groped from beginning to end, place by place, and turned over all the Soviet technical books in Zhang Xibao's house, but after a long time, they still didn't find out where the problem was.

    Shengli limply fell into the chair, grabbed the introduction of the experience of the Soviet cutting expert Bekov, and sighed as he flipped through it, saying, "Is there really no way?" Suddenly, he stood up and took a step forward, pulling Zhang Xibao's arm and pushing him, saying, "Look quickly, is it this problem?"

    "Where? … Hmm, the tool surface should be ground very smoothly, like glass, so that the heat can be reduced on the tool tip. … That's right, that's the problem." Zhang Xibao hugged Shengli and shook him back and forth, saying, "When we grind the tool, we just forgot about this so-called trivial matter, and as a result, we caused a disaster. How can we grind it so smoothly? … Lapping."

    "You're right, lapping. I'll go find a lapping worker for help early tomorrow morning." Shengli patted Zhang Xibao's hand, looked down at his watch, and stuck out his tongue, saying, "This is terrible, I have to go home quickly, otherwise I'll have another family meeting." Saying this, he ran away in a puff of smoke, causing Zhang Xibao to laugh loudly. …

    The next night, as soon as Shengli stepped into the gate, his son Zhiqiang went up to grab his clothes and shook his hand at him, then the two of them tiptoed in.

    The radio was playing, and Peng Yuzhen was holding her daughter Zhiming and listening quietly. As soon as Shengli saw it, he understood half of it, and quickly sat down on the chair, with a slight smile on his face.

    "… Shengli surpassed Chen Genrong and Song Wanqing with a new cutting record of 1,287 meters, but these young men are also working hard, and their competition is not over…"

    "Yes, I don't know how many days this record can be maintained!" Shengli murmured softly.

    III.

    Three days later, a car drove very quickly from the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory to the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory in Minhang Town. Shengli had been working the night shift last night, and it was said that he could take this opportunity to take a nap, but he couldn't close his eyes no matter what. He had heard the name Song Wanqing, but he had never seen what he looked like. It was not a simple matter for a third-grade worker to create a cutting speed of more than 1,000 meters! The Municipal Communist Youth League is organizing him to perform today, and I have to take this opportunity to cheer him on.

    "Master Sheng, you have to give Song Wanqing good guidance today. You are a senior, so don't be conservative!" The factory's Communist Youth League secretary pushed Shengli.

    "Forget it, I'm not old enough to be a senior. Today, I'm going to learn wholeheartedly." Shengli said this, but he was a little worried in his heart, regretting that he didn't borrow a few tools with him last night. What would he do if he really couldn't step down when he got there? He was so anxious that he groped all over his body. Hey! It was a coincidence that he had unintentionally carried the two magnetic knives that the Soviet youth machinist Fyodorov had given him last October in his pocket. This time, he was finally relieved. But he still warned himself not to show any expression.

    The comrades from the Municipal Communist Youth League who organized the Song Wanqing performance, and other representatives from various factories, heard that Shengli had arrived, and they all rushed up and surrounded him.

    Some asked him about his experience in creating a new city record three days ago, and others asked him about the process of modifying the lathe. It was noisy and lively.

    Finally, after the persuasion of the comrades from the Municipal Communist Youth League, he humbly agreed to be Song Wanqing's assistant.

    In the crowd of more than 200 people, Shengli and Song Wanqing met.

    The two men shook hands tightly. Shengli looked at this slender, slightly weak young man in front of him, and the first thing he thought of was to urge him to improve his health. Song Wanqing stared blankly at Shengli's face, and said repeatedly, "Master Sheng, you have to help me a lot! I was almost ecstatic when I heard you were coming."

    "Don't panic, take a deep breath. As long as you are calm during the performance, there will be no problems." Shengli encouraged Song Wanqing in a low voice. Saying this, he tidied up the performance tools for him.

    The performance began quickly. After the comrades from the Municipal Communist Youth League gave a brief introduction, hundreds of eyes were all focused on Song Wanqing and the lathe he was working on. Shengli patted Song Wanqing and said in a low voice, "Go ahead, be careful." It seemed that he didn't want to be a tutor on the mouth, but in fact, he was more concerned than a real tutor.

    Song Wanqing made preparations for protection, nodded to Shengli and the people around him, and skillfully stepped onto the lathe.

    The lathe roared, and Shengli, along with everyone else, focused his eyes on the place where Song Wanqing was working. He silently recited the number of revolutions of the headstock and the diameter of the workpiece used by Song Wanqing, and habitually calculated the details in his mind.

    "Ah! … Exceeding 1,300 meters per minute cutting speed? … He surpassed me again." Shengli's heart suddenly jumped violently, thinking that he had seen it wrong and calculated it wrong. He quickly squeezed his eyes, looked at it again twice, and turned it over and over, calculating continuously five times, completely proving that he had not seen it wrong or calculated it wrong.

    "He surpassed me." Shengli suddenly felt a hidden pain in his heart, looked at Song Wanqing several times, and his head lowered unconsciously. Just then, there was a commotion among the people, and after the lathe made a strange noise, it suddenly went silent. Shengli quickly raised his head and saw Song Wanqing blushing and sweating profusely as he disassembled the tool. Shengli knew that something was wrong, and quickly took a step forward to get close to Song Wanqing.

    "Master Sheng, the tool is burnt." Song Wanqing said in a very low voice.

    "It doesn't matter, burning the tool is common during testing, don't worry, replace it with a new one, and make the feed a little smaller." Shengli quickly opened the toolbox, and saw that there were only two tools left, and was surprised, saying, "Are there only these few tools?"

    "Yes."

    "Oh! Too few tools were prepared, the preparation work was not done well." Shengli handed a tool to Song Wanqing, and was worried for him in his heart; but he was also afraid of affecting the performance mood, so he deliberately calmed down.

    Song Wanqing installed the tool, and Shengli didn't even divert his attention this time, concentrating on watching, but it was still the same as before, just after machining a path, the tool burned again. He even used the last spare tool, and it burned in the same way.

    There were high and low voices of discussion in the venue, Song Wanqing's face had already turned almost as red as Guan Gong, and Shengli himself was covered in sweat. It wasn't until the comrade in charge of the venue announced a break that the air in the venue seemed to become a little calmer.

    Shengli took heavy steps and walked forward a few steps. A chattering sound of discussion entered Shengli's ears.

    "It's fast, but what's so rare about burning tools all the time."

    "Don't say that, he's a young worker, and his skills are always a little lacking."

    "But we're here to learn! … I think we should just ask Shengli to perform, to make up for the lesson, so we won't have come in vain."…

    Although these words were not about Shengli, every sentence was like a knife stabbing Shengli's heart.

    "I'll perform? No!" Shengli's heart was churning: "What are we launching the competition initiative for? Is it for fame or for profit? No! It's to promote social progress. Now millions of eyes are staring at us workers, as if they are asking us: Agriculture, private industry and commerce, and handicrafts have all seen a climax. But what about your industry! When will the leaders be able to usher in a climax? … How many low-grade workers like Song Wanqing are there in the country? Far more than us high-grade workers. If they can all learn from him, what will production be like. … It is our responsibility to help him." Thinking of this, Shengli groped all over his body, and when his hand touched the magnetic knife in his pocket, he was stunned for a moment, and then grabbed it hard, his heart almost jumping out, and he said repeatedly, "I have a solution."

    Shengli found the factory's Communist Youth League secretary and told him about his intention to borrow the tool for Song Wanqing. The Communist Youth League secretary hugged Shengli with both hands, stunned for a long time, and then said repeatedly, "You are really a model." Saying this, he led him to the comrade from the Municipal Communist Youth League who was in charge of the performance. …

    The performance was announced to start again, and Shengli扶着宋万庆 appeared next to the machine again.

  The comrade from the Municipal Communist Youth League announced that Song Wanqing's cutting speed had reached 1,357 meters, but the tool was burnt. Now Shengli has lent his two magnetic tools to let Song Wanqing continue the performance. Before he finished speaking, there was a burst of fierce applause in the audience, followed by a burst of discussion, which continued to sound for a long time before it stopped. Some people even raised their hats and waved in the direction of Shengli and Song Wanqing.

    "Master Sheng, you should perform, I'm very scared." Song Wanqing whispered to Shengli.

    "Don't be afraid, it's the same as usual, just think of it as working. … Okay, I'll install it first." Shengli finished speaking, walked to the lathe, and carefully installed the tool for him, then stepped back and lightly told him what he should pay attention to.

    The lathe rang again, Song Wanqing carefully rocked the tool post, and Shengli also watched with trepidation. Iron filings, like clods of mud, popped out of the tool, dancing like flames.

    The faces of the people in the entire venue slowly relaxed, with smiles, and they nodded. Shengli looked at Song Wanqing's back and gently put the hand pressed on his chest down, breathing a long sigh of relief.

    The sound of the lathe slowly stopped. Applause rang out again throughout the venue, as natural, enthusiastic, and orderly as before.

    The crowd surrounded him, Song Wanqing trembling, with light flashing in his eyes, handed the tool to Shengli's hand, and said in a low voice, "Master Sheng, thank you."

    Shengli took the tool with his left hand, held his hand tightly with his right hand, and stared at Song Wanqing's face again, thinking in his heart, "This young man will be good in the future!" Just then, he heard someone say in his ear, "Song Wanqing has overthrown Shengli again." He shuddered violently….

    The venue was crowded with people participating in the performance, and everyone was concentrating on the stage.

    Shengli was speaking on the stage in such an excited, trembling voice: "… Today, we are not just working for a machine, a factory production plan, but to realize the ideals of the people of the whole country, to build socialism faster, to change the motherland, to change the world. Today, Song Wanqing has surpassed me, and tomorrow, there may be more people who will surpass him! Everyone is competing, but not for themselves. … Although I am more than ten years older than Song Wanqing, I can't catch up, but I will follow, and our competition is not over. … In our country, life will always be like this."…

    我们的竞赛没有结束
    费礼文
    一
    盛利望着刚车出来的活，用手背抹了下脸上汗珠，嘘口气说：“车头打足三百转，车来车去还是鱼鳞班……唉！老黄牛呀！真对你没有办法。”说着他拍了下车床。
    “盛师傅，你教我们的五种苏联先进切削经验，真是好法子呀。哈，今天干的活快了一倍多哩。”液压车间一个青工，突然走到盛利身旁指手划脚说道：“我准同车间大伙一样，把你教的玩意全学会，乘飞机赶上你！”
    “赶上我？”盛利松下手里的活。
    “是呀！你三年就完成了五年计划，现在又发动提高切削竞赛，把整个上海工人都鼓起来了。你带了头，我们不双脚擦油往前赶，那不成了落后分子啦。……告诉你，我们车间有一大半车工学会你教的法子啦。”……
    “又是这样多的人？……赶上来。”盛利等他走了，脑子里马上翻腾起来。他用眼望望过去做过的一千二百转快车头车床，多熟悉的床子呵！两年多来，在它上面创造、改进了近四十件工具和操作法，赶过了时间，把五年的活，三年不到就干完了，打响了开场炮。也就是这部床子，自己学习了各种苏联先进经验，并把这些经验教给厂里厂外工人弟兄们，把大伙学习先进劲头给掀起了。他更清楚地记得，两个多月前，就是在这部床子上，第一个用五百五十五公尺切削速度，创造了全市新纪录，鼓起了全上海展开提高切削速度竞赛。……唉！大家是鼓起来，每天都有成百成千的人，你赶上我，我超过你，报纸、电台简直像翻了天！今天冒出傅明坤，明天又冒出了陈根荣，连自己过去经常帮助的归国华侨李锦标，也赶过了我，创造出全市新纪录。可我盛利呢？偏偏会在这时调了床子，人同床子一样，变成了老黄牛，老缠在一百公尺切削速度上……。
    盛利想到这里，望望车间里直到现在还贴满了的“向盛利学习”标语，咬了下嘴唇说：“领导上为什么偏偏要叫我调床子？……同他们说去，这样下去怎办！”说着迈开了步子。
    但只走了一步，又折回身来，心里责备着自己：“你是怎么啦？……领导上不是已经说过几次，调床子是因为生产任务增加了，这部利门车床成了关键，必须调位高级技工支援。……我们发动竞赛的目的，不正是为了搞好生产？……你也顾着自己，他也本位主义，利门车床让谁去做？为了创纪录，生产任务都不顾了吗？……难道劳动模范这四个字，是应该戴在个人打算的人身上吗？”想着想着，他的脸红了起来，赶忙回手拿起干活图样蹲了下来。
    “办法想了一大堆，车头不能再打快！”盛利望着横在面前老长的车床，呆了好一会，突然一皱眉头说：“唔？这样结实的床子，为什么不能叫它再变得快些？……对！要想法子叫它变成快车头！”盛利乐得站起来，但没有一会又嘘了口说：“怎么改呢？……动力设备科能同意把床子改装吗？”……
    就在这时，有人轻轻拍了下盛利肩膀说：“老盛呀，怎唉声叹气的呀！”
    盛利回头一看，原来是艾厂长。
    艾厂长从上到下，打量了一下这个矮矮个子、结实身体、生就一张圆盆大脸的切削能手，松开嘴唇笑着说：“你们主任向我说啦。哈，把你这样一个关键人物，调到这部关键床子上来，是做对啦。劳动模范吗？就是同关键问题斗出来的呀。……老盛呀，做个劳动模范不简单呀！既要带头，又要迎头赶上，大伙谈起来，总是要把先进人物说成天生的铁打钢铸的英雄。……其实，他同大伙一样，接受到困难担子的时候，也同样是会闹思想别扭，闹情绪的。可是，他们所以能成为英雄，就是因为他们能走在大伙前头，扫掉这些挡路石，一步一步向前跨着。……怎样？调到这部全厂出名的老黄牛床子上，闹了情绪吧。”说着他又用手拍了拍盛利。
    “唔。”盛利的脸红了起来，摸摸手里图样，望望厂长的脸，好像自己心思全给他的眼睛看见了似的。半晌，不自然的低下头来，小声的说：“是有一点。”
    “哈，能老实就好。怎办？可不能让它老放在脑子里啊！……全上海的车工，正赛得火热呢，你这个带头的，松劲不得啊。”
    “我正在想主意，想把这部老黄牛变成快车头。”……
    “呵！好啊。”艾厂长打断盛利话头说：“做得对，应该让每部床子变成飞机，每部床子出模范。主意想出了吗？”
    “我想这部床子，如果马力能变大，车头能变快，生活不就能干得快啦？……可就怕动力设备科不答应改。”
    “哈，倒是打铁趁热，好主意，谁都应该答应、支持。”艾厂长一摆手说：“行呀，你先动脑筋画出图来，我这就去同你们主任说，要他组织人帮助你，动力设备科？包给我啦！这算不算支持？……哈，剩下来全看你的啦！”
    盛利望着厂长的背影，周身像顿时热得滚烫。他跨上几步，拍拍车床，嘴里嘀咕道：“嘿！老黄牛，要你脱骨换胎哪。”说着埋着头使劲干起活来。 二厂礼拜六的早晨，盛利跨着老大步子，向自己车间走着。
    初升的太阳，把他的脸颊照得分外通红。他一面走一面说，什么也掩盖不住自己内心发出的笑容。盼望了多少天呵！真想不到，老黄牛变成快车头了。
    记得将近一个月前，自己开夜车画出的那张歪歪斜斜的草图后，经过艾厂长的亲自督促，很快的，动力设备科就派了技术员，根据自己提的意见，作了多次修改，帮助最后决定将机床油泵压力减少；同时调整皮带盘，加大马力来提高车头转速。现在经过修理人员利用春节假期赶修，居然真的使车头速度摇身一变，从三百转变成了八百二十转。现在，该是提高切削速度试验时候啦。
    盛利想到这里，松了口气，轻轻地笑出声来。
    走进车间，工会生产委员张锡宝，已经等在那里，他一见盛利就喊道：“老盛呀！你得赶紧试呀！汽轮机厂，又冒出了个宋万庆啦。嘿！人家才三级工呢：居然创造了1，055公尺新纪录哩！”
    “呵！冒了这么高？这不连保持七百多公尺纪录的陈根荣也给摔了下来吗！……还只是个三级工？”
    “当然全部摔下来啦。……好啦，反正现在是天天在变。告诉你，一些耳朵尖的新闻记者，已经得到你改装床子风声，马上要来看你的新纪录哩！”
    “真是变得快呀！”盛利拍了拍车床。
    车床边上黑压压围了一大群人。
    车头飞快地转着，盛利头上冒着汗珠，两眼紧盯着工作物，用力摇着刀架，刀架上硬质合金刀，一碰上工作物，就“嘶，嘶”地叫着，由蓝变成紫的铁屑，像箭一般地射得几尺高；切削出来的工作物，镜子般闪着亮光。大伙的眼睛，无论近的远的，全集中在那把小小的车刀口上，看着看着，工作物还没车好一半，刀口地方已经冒出烟来。
  “不行！快摇开，刀子又烧啦。”张锡宝用急促的声音喊着。
    随着盛利关车的声音，在场的人都不约而同地叹了口气。
    车床边上已经摆着三把烧坏了刀口的车刀。盛利低头看看手里拆下来的车刀，像有几斤重似的压在他手里。
    “唉！真伤脑筋，车得好好的又烧了。”
    “而且全烧在一个地方。”
    人声喧嚷起来，你一言我一语地议论起来。
    几个新闻记者相互望了几下，叽咕一阵，走到盛利旁边。
    “盛利同志，现在试一千二百八十七公尺，刀子耐不住烧了，可是你刚才不是已经创造了一千零六十多公尺纪录，这已经超过宋万庆了。这个消息你同意发出去吗？”
    “不同意，烧坏了刀子，还算什么新纪录？……试验难道就为了超过谁吗？我们是竞赛，可不是竞争。……毛病出在哪呀？”
    第二天厂礼拜，彭玉珍为了能让他爱人盛利睡会安稳觉，故意领着孩子到外面去玩。临走的时候，亲眼看见他打着呼；可是，等到转了一个小圈子赶回去，房间里居然连个人影子也看不见。彭玉珍气得直跺脚。
    其实，盛利满肚子心思，根本就没有睡着，前脚彭玉珍跨出门，后脚盛利就穿上衣服，从后门蹓到张锡宝家里。
    张锡宝正背着手，在房间里走来走去。一回脸看见盛利，就说：“怎么到现在才来呀？把人肺都急炸啦。”
    “我那个太太！唉，实在没她法子。……好，先别管她。毛病找出来吗？”盛利抓抓头发走到张锡宝身旁。
    “找出来倒好啦！……唔，车得好好的，新纪录挑到眉梢上给跑了。”张锡宝拍了拍桌子。
    “现在别恋在新纪录上啦，找毛病要紧。……难道刀子角度磨得不对吗？”
    “刀子一拿来，我就亲自作了检查，又校对过苏联先进经验，一点也没有错。不信，我这里还有材料，你拿去看看。”张锡宝背着手，又在房间里踱了起来。
    “那是什么毛病呢？”盛利也跟着踱了起来。
    两个人从头到尾，一处一处地摸索，把张锡宝家里一些苏联技术书全翻开了，可是，弄了老半天，仍旧没有发现毛病出在什么地方。
    盛利有气无力的倒到椅子上，抓着苏联切削能手贝可夫的经验介绍，一面翻一面嘘了口气说：“真的没有办法了吗？”忽然，他一下子站起来，抢上一步拉着张锡宝膀子推了一下说：“快看，是不是这个毛病。”
    “在哪？……唔，车刀刀面要磨得特别光洁，像玻璃一样，这样可以减少热度存在刀口上。……对，是这个毛病。”张锡宝一下抱住盛利，晃了又晃说：“我们磨刀子时候，偏偏把这种所谓小事给忘了，结果闯了大祸。怎样才能磨得特别光呢？……研磨。”
    “说得对，研磨，明天一早就去找研磨工帮忙。”盛利拍拍张锡宝的手，低头看了下手表，伸下舌头说：“可不得了，赶快回家去，不然又得开家庭会议啦。”说着一溜烟跑了，惹得张锡宝大声笑了起来。……
    第二天晚上，盛利刚跨进大门，他儿子志强就迎上去牵住他衣裳，对他摇摇手，然后两人蹑手蹑脚走进去。
    收音机正响着，彭玉珍抱着女儿志明在静静听着，盛利一看，心里已经明白了一半，连忙轻轻的坐到椅子上，嘴上微露出笑容。
    “……盛利以1，287公尺切削新纪录，赶过了陈根荣，也赶过了宋万庆，可是这些小伙子也正在加油，他们的竞赛没有结束。……”
  “是呀，这个纪录不知能保持几天呵！”盛利轻声的嘀咕着。三　
  三天后，一部汽车用着很快的速度，从上海机床厂往闵行镇上海汽轮机厂开着。盛利昨晚做着夜班，照说可以乘此机会打下瞌睡，可是说什么也合不上眼。宋万庆这个名字是听到了，可是人到底是什么样子，却没有见过，一个三级工能创造一千多公尺切削速度，这不是一件简单事呀！今天团市委组织他表演，我得乘这个机会，好好的给他打几下气。
    “盛师傅，今天你可要好好辅导一下宋万庆呵，老前辈啦，可别保守呵！”厂里团委书记向盛利推了一下。
    “算啦，从哪老得起呵，今天，我是专心去学习的。”盛利嘴这样说，心里倒有点发愁，后悔昨晚没有借几把刀带着，假使到那里真的轰得下不了台怎办？说着急得周身乱摸着，嗨！巧得很，去年十月苏联青年车工费奥多罗夫送他的两把磁刀，倒无心带在衣袋里，这下，总算定了下神。但还是警戒着自己，不要露出一点神色来。
    组织宋万庆表演会的团市委同志，和其他各厂代表，听说盛利来了，都一下子拥上去把他围了起来。
    这个问他前三天创造全市新纪录经验，那个问他改车床过程，熙熙攘攘闹成一片。
    最后经过团市委同志劝说，他才谦虚地答应做宋万庆助手。
    在拥有二百多人的人堆里，盛利和宋万庆见面了。
    两人的手握得紧紧的。盛利看看他面前这位瘦长，略现体弱的小伙子，心里首先想到的是要督促他把身体练好。宋万庆却呆呆望着盛利的脸，连声说着：“盛师傅，你要多帮助我呵！听说你来，差点把我乐呆了。”
    “别慌，沉着气。表演的时候只要心里安定，是出不了什么问题。”盛利轻声地对宋万庆鼓励着。说着从旁替他整理着表演用具。
    表演会很快的开始了，团市委同志简单作了下介绍后，几百双眼睛全汇集到宋万庆身上和他干活的床子。盛利拍拍宋万庆，低声说：“去吧，细心点。”看上去他嘴说不愿做辅导，实际上他比真正的辅导员还要操心哩。
    宋万庆做好防护准备，向盛利和四周的人点了下头，老练的走上了车床。
    车床呼的响了起来，盛利随着大伙，把眼睛对准宋万庆干活地方。他默念着宋万庆用的车头转数、工作物直径大小，心里习惯的算着细账。
    “啊！……超过一千三百公尺切削速度吗？……又赶过我啦。”盛利心里猛的卜卜跳了起来，当是自己看花眼，算错账。赶忙挤了挤眼，重新看了两遍，又翻过来倒过去，用心算连续算了五遍，完全证明自己没有看错，也没有算错。
    “是赶过我啦。”盛利心里突然发出一阵隐痛，连看了宋万庆几眼，头不知不觉有点低了下来。就在这时，人们轰的一阵骚动，车床发出一阵怪声后，突然没有了声音。盛利连忙抬起头来，只见宋万庆正涨红着脸，满头大汗地拆着刀子。盛利知道不妙，赶忙追上一步靠到宋万庆身边。
    “盛师傅，刀子烧坏了。”宋万庆用着非常低的声音说着。
    “不要紧，试验时烧刀子是常有的事，别焦心，重新换一把，走刀稍为打小点。”盛利抢着打开工具箱，一看车刀只剩下两把，惊了下说：“就这么几把刀子吗？”
    “是呀。”
    “唉呀！刀子备得太少啦，准备工作做得不好。”盛利递把刀子给宋万庆，心里替他担起忧来；但又怕影响表演情绪，还是故意镇定下来。
    宋万庆装好刀子，盛利这下连神也没分一下，集中思想看着，但还是同刚才一样，刚车了一道，刀子又烧了。一直把最后一把备刀用上去，也是同样烧了。
    会场里人声高高低低议论着，宋万庆的脸已经快红成关公模样，盛利自己也满身衣服汗湿了。直等到主持会场同志宣布休息，会场里空气才好像变得和缓了些。
    盛利踏着很沉重的步子，向前走了几步。一阵叽叽喳喳议论声音，送进了盛利耳朵。
    “快倒是快，刀子老烧掉有什么稀奇。”
    “别这么说，人家是青工，技术总是差些。”
    “可我们是来学的呀！……我看干脆叫盛利表演一下，补补课，好不算白跑。”……
    这些话虽然不是讲盛利，可是句句都像刀子扎在盛利心上。
    “我去表演？不！”盛利心里翻腾着：“我们发动竞赛倡议，为了什么？难道是为了名，还是为了利吗？不！是为了推动社会前进。现在千百万双眼睛在盯着我们工人，像是在问我们：农业，私营工商业，手工业，都出现了高潮。可你们工业！带头的，什么时候才能冒出高潮呀？……像宋万庆这样级数低的工人，全国该有多少，比我们这些级数多的工人要多得多，假使他们都能从他这里得到学习榜样，那该要使生产变成什么样子。……要帮助他，这是我们责任。”盛利想到这里，周身乱摸着，当他的手一下碰到袋里磁刀，他先楞了一下，然后使劲一把抓住它，心简直跳得像要跳了出来，嘴里连声说着：“有法子啦。”
    盛利找到厂里团委书记，把自己准备借刀子给宋万庆的意思说了一遍。团委书记双手抱着盛利，楞了好一会，才连声说：“你真
  是个模范呀。”说着领着他走到负责表演的团市委同志跟前去了。……
    表演会又宣布开始了，盛利扶着宋万庆又出现在机床旁边。
  团市委同志宣布宋万庆切削速度已经达到1，357公尺，但是刀子烧了，现在盛利借出自己两把磁刀，让宋万庆继续表演。他的话声还没落下去，全场响起了一阵激烈掌声，接着又是一阵议论声音，连续不断地响出好一阵才停。有的人还举着帽子向盛利和宋万庆这边招着。
    “盛师傅，还是你来表演吧，我怕得很。”宋万庆小声地对盛利叽咕着。
    “别怕，同平常一样，只当是在干活。……好吧，我先给装好。”盛利讲完了，走到床子旁边，替他细心地装好刀子，然后退回来，轻声告诉他应该注意的地方。
    车床又响了起来，宋万庆小心翼翼摇动刀架，盛利也悬着胆子望着。铁屑像泥块似的从刀子上弹了出来，焰火似的飞舞着。
    整个会场里的人，脸颊都慢慢地放松了，有了笑容，而且还点起头来。盛利望望宋万庆背影，把按在胸口的手，轻轻地放了下去，长长地嘘了口气。
    车床声音慢慢停了。全场又响起了掌声，同刚才一样，是那样的自然，热情，整齐。
    人群围了上来，宋万庆抖着手，眼眶里闪着亮光把刀子递到盛利手里，轻声说：“盛师傅，谢谢你。”
    盛利左手接过刀子，右手紧握他的手，再一次盯着宋万庆的脸，心里想：“这小伙子，将来不错呀！”就在这时，他耳边听见有人说了一声：“宋万庆把盛利又摔下来啦。”他猛的打了一个寒噤……。
    会场里挤满了参加表演会的人，大家正聚精会神对着主席台上。
    盛利用着那样激动，发抖的声音，在台上讲着：“……我们今天干活，不只是为了一部机器，一个工厂生产计划，而是在实现全国人民理想，快点建成社会主义、改变祖国、改变世界。今天宋万庆赶过了我，明天可能有更多的人赶过了他！大家都在竞赛，但不是为了个人。……我虽然比宋万庆大上十多岁，可我追不上，跟也要跟上去，我们的竞赛没有结束。……在我们的国家里，生活永远就是这样。”……
