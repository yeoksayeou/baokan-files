    “Golden River”

    Fengqiao in Suzhou is a famous scenic spot in Jiangnan. When people come here to visit, they can also see a small, deep yellow river near Fengqiao. In the green hills and clear waters of Jiangnan, such a yellow river is quite unique. But how could a "Yellow River" appear by the Yangtze River? It turns out that this "Yellow River" originates from the main drainage channel of the jointly owned Hua Sheng Paper Mill. The pulp lost by this factory has dyed this river yellow all year round.

    Near this "Yellow River," more than 30 peasant households have been rowing small boats year-round to salvage the yellow pulp floating on the river. Some farmland along the riverbanks is also often covered with a layer of yellow. When this yellow stuff dries, it becomes a good fuel. These things can also be sold as a reliable side income all year round. A farmer can earn more than three yuan a day by salvaging, so some farmers simply gave up farming and turned the land along the river into a year-round drying yard. This "Yellow River" is truly an inexhaustible "golden river" for the local people.

    Although salvaging pulp has become the main side occupation for local residents, they are still indignant about this waste of state property. They often send criticisms to the factory, and some even directly question and criticize the factory leaders. However, this serious waste has rarely changed in recent years. Recently, the local farmers have all organized and established the Shuguang Agricultural Production Cooperative. In addition to continuing to urge the factory to improve, they also temporarily regard pulp salvaging as a side production of the agricultural cooperative, specially organizing thirty-two laborers and twelve boats to carry out salvaging, and also allocating twelve mu of cultivated land as a year-round pulp drying site. According to Liu Yuying, the production captain of the pulp salvaging team, from the beginning of March to mid-April, although it rained for more than ten days, and half of the salvaged pulp was washed away by the rain, they still dried and sold 120,000 jin of pulp cakes. Calculated at the local market price of six jiao per hundred jin, they earned 720 yuan from this side occupation. If the weather is sunny, their income will increase greatly.

    Hua Sheng Paper Mill has been losing pulp ever since it was built. During the period of capitalist management, this waste was not surprising, but in the three years after the public-private partnership, it has not been fundamentally overcome, which is incomprehensible. Looking at the equipment, it can be seen that the factory leadership has no intention of solving this problem at all. The factory's equipment originally had the problem of pulp loss, so a pulp-lifting copper wire mesh was installed at the factory's drainage outlet very early to finally salvage some of the pulp. If this equipment is properly managed, at least 600 kilograms of pulp can be recovered per day, but in reality, this equipment has not been used at all, and this pulp, which could have been saved, is wasted into the river.

    How much pulp does Hua Sheng Paper Mill lose annually? How great is the loss? None of the factory leaders have any idea. I asked the staff of the first and second workshops, and they all shook their heads; the comrades of the third workshop said: "About 7%-9% is lost." Someone once calculated that if the pulp loss is reduced by 3%, at least 60,000 yuan or more could be saved annually.

    The factory's perennial pulp loss and the nearby farmers' seasonal pulp salvaging seem to have become a matter of course, an "unchangeable law." The factory leaders believe that problems that have not been solved for decades cannot be solved all at once. Therefore, despite the constant opinions of the masses, the leadership's fixed views have never changed. They are obsessed with the existing achievements: "Before liberation, the pulp yield rate was only 53%, and now it has been increased to 56%," believing that "phoenixes are flying all over the sky" (the Phoenix brand yellow cardboard produced by this factory is an export product), and they are leisurely complacent in the glory of "brand-name goods." This serious complacency makes it impossible for them to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses and prevents them from taking pulp waste seriously.

    What is especially wrong is that some comrades in this factory completely put improving quality and saving raw materials in opposition to each other. They repeatedly emphasize that to improve paper quality, pulp loss must be increased. Then why is it that in the past few years, with consistently serious pulp loss, the quality of their produced yellow cardboard has sometimes been very poor and sometimes relatively good? Since the beginning of this year, the factory leaders have focused on solving the quality problem of export yellow cardboard, which has greatly improved the folding endurance of the yellow cardboard. The folding endurance of No. 8 yellow cardboard was only once in the past, but now it has been increased to more than forty times. Their efforts in improving quality are commendable and entirely appropriate. From this, it can also be seen that it is completely wrong to put improving quality and saving raw materials in opposition to each other.

    Under the supervision of the masses and the attention of relevant leading departments, Hua Sheng Paper Mill has begun to take some measures, changing the copper wire mesh of each workshop from twenty-five holes to thirty-five holes to reduce the pulp lost from the mesh. However, no one is responsible for the copper wire mesh at the drainage outlet, and other work is also progressing slowly. As the leader of the factory, one should be fully responsible for production, and the problem of pulp waste is no exception, and effective measures must be taken, relying on the worker masses, to solve it seriously and quickly.

    “黄金河”
    越峨
    苏州枫桥是江南有名的风景区之一，人们到这里来游览的时候，还可以看到枫桥附近有一条深黄色的小河。在青山绿水的江南有这么一条黄色的小河，倒也很别致。但是在长江之边怎么会出现“黄河”呢？原来这条“黄河”发源于公私合营华盛纸厂的总排水道，是这个工厂流失的纸浆把这条河常年染成了黄色的。
    在这条“黄河”的附近，有三十多户农民常年驾着小船打捞浮在这条河上的黄色纸浆，沿河两岸有一些农田也常常铺上一层黄色，等到这种黄色的东西晒干了，就是一种很好的燃料。这些东西还可以出售，作为一项一年四季可靠的副业收入。一个农民打捞一天可以收入三元多，所以有的农民干脆放弃了耕田，把沿河的土地作为常年的晒场。这条“黄河”，真是当地人民取之不尽的“黄金河”。
    打捞纸浆虽然已经变成当地居民的主要副业，但是居民依然为这种浪费国家资财的现象感到愤慨。他们经常把批评意见寄给工厂，甚至有人还直接找工厂的领导人员提出责问和批评。可是，几年来这种严重浪费的状况却很少改变。最近当地农民已经全部组织起来，成立了曙光农业生产合作社，他们除了继续督促工厂改进外，也暂时把打捞纸浆作为农业合作社的一项副业生产，专门组织了三十二个劳动力，十二条船进行打捞，同时还拨出十二亩耕田作为常年翻晒纸浆的场地。根据打捞纸浆的生产队长刘玉英谈，他们从三月初到四月中旬，虽然有十几天下雨，打捞起来的纸浆被雨水冲走损失了一半，也还晒干出售了十二万斤纸浆饼。按当地每百斤六角的市价计算，在这项副业中就得到七百二十元的收入，如果天气晴朗，那么他们的收入还要大大增加。
    华盛纸厂自从建厂以后，就一直流失纸浆。在资本主义经营时期，这种浪费现象是不足为奇的，可是在公私合营三年后的今天，一直没有从根本上克服这一严重浪费，那就不可理解了。从设备上看，就可以看出工厂领导上根本就没有打算解决这一问题。这个工厂的设备本来就有流失纸浆的毛病，所以在工厂排水出口处很早就安装了一只撩浆铜丝网，以便最后捞起一部分纸浆。如果这一设备管理好了，一天起码可以捞回六百公斤纸浆，而实际上这一设备根本没有被利用，这些本来可以不受损失的纸浆也白白冲到河里去了。
    究竟华盛纸厂流失的纸浆全年有多少？有多大的损失？工厂领导人员中至今没有一个人心中有数。我问第一车间和第二车间的工作人员，他们都摇摇头；第三车间的同志说：“大约流失7％—9％”。有人曾经这样计算过，如果纸浆流失量减少3％，全年起码能够节约六万元以上。
    工厂常年流失纸浆，附近农民四季捞浆，仿佛已经成为天经地义“不可改变的规律”了。工厂领导上认为：几十年来不能解决的问题怎么能一下子解决呢？因此，尽管群众意见纷纷，始终不能改变领导上这种一成不变的看法。他们一直迷恋于现有的成绩：“解放前纸浆成浆率只有53％，现在已经提高到56％了”，认为“凤凰满天飞”（这个厂出产的凤凰牌黄板纸是出国产品），躺在“名牌货”的荣誉里悠然自得。这种严重的骄傲自满情绪使他们没有可能虚心倾听群众的意见，没有把浪费纸浆看在眼里。
    尤其错误的是这个厂有些同志把提高质量和节约原料完全置于对立的地位。他们一再强调：要提高纸张质量，纸浆流失量就一定要增加。那么为什么几年来在纸浆流失一贯严重的情况下，他们生产的黄板纸有时质量十分低劣，而有时又比较好呢？今年以来，这个厂的领导人员专心解决了出口黄板纸的质量问题，使黄板纸的折力有很大提高，八号黄板纸的耐折力过去只有一次，而现在已经提高到四十次以上。他们在提高质量方面的努力是值得鼓励的，而且也是完全应该的。从这里也可以看出：把提高质量和节约原料对立起来是十分错误的。
    华盛纸厂在群众的督促和有关领导部门的重视下，开始采取一些措施，将各车间的铜丝网从二十五孔改为三十五孔，以减少从网内流失的纸浆。但是排水出口处的铜丝网至今仍无人负责，其他工作进行得也很迟缓。作为工厂的领导者，应该对生产全面负责，对纸浆浪费的问题当然也不能例外，必须采取有效措施，依靠工人群众，认真迅速地予以解决。
