    Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, 8th (TASS): The Dutch newspaper "Truth" published a joint communique from the Executive Committee of the Dutch Socialist League and the Political Bureau of the Dutch Communist Party stating that the two parties "will no longer attack each other in the interests of the struggle for peace and socialism" and will strive to resolve disputes on the basis of Marxist-Leninist principles. The communique pointed out that the two parties believe that the decisions they have taken "can promote the improvement of relations in the Dutch workers' movement."
    The communique said that the Socialist League "believes that its task is to play an intermediary role in creating favorable conditions for consolidating mutual understanding and cooperation, and to promote the unity of the working class and all those in the Netherlands who are oriented towards left-wing policies." To this end, the Socialist League will not independently nominate candidates in the upcoming Dutch parliamentary elections.
    The Dutch newspaper "Truth" will henceforth open a special column for the Socialist League to express its views.

    在马克思列宁主义基础上统一行动
　　荷共和社会主义联盟建立合作
    新华社8日讯  据塔斯社海牙八日讯：荷兰“真理报”发表荷兰社会主义联盟执行委员会和荷兰共产党政治局的联合公报说，两党“为了和平和社会主义斗争的利益将不再彼此进行攻击”，并且将努力在马克思—列宁主义原则的基础上解决争执问题。公报指出，两党认为，它们所采取的决定“能够促进荷兰工人运动中关系的改善”。
    公报说，社会主义联盟“认为自己的任务是在为巩固互相了解和合作而创造有利条件方面起中间人作用，促成工人阶级和荷兰一切以左翼政策为方针的人的团结一致”。为此，社会主义联盟将不在即将到来的荷兰议会选举中独自提出候选人。
    荷兰“真理报”以后将辟专栏，让社会主义联盟表示自己的观点。
