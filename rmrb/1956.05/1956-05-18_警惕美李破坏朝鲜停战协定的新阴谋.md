Beware of New US-Syngman Rhee Conspiracy to Sabotage the Korean Armistice Agreement

    According to reports from American news agencies, at the meeting of the sixteen nations that participated in the Korean War, held in Washington starting on May 4th, the United States demanded "significant limitations on the scope of activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea," and even "ending the de facto activities of this commission." At the same time, Syngman Rhee in South Korea was once again clamoring that the allies who fought in the Korean War should "declare the armistice invalid" and that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should be "kicked out" of Korea. U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Robertson even declared blatantly in Seoul that "there will be no further withdrawal of U.S. troops from Korea in the foreseeable future," and also said that "Washington is discussing a proposal to equip the Republic of Korea Army with new-type weapons."

    These bellicose clamors clearly expose the intention of the United States to further undermine the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea. The Korean Armistice Agreement clearly stipulates that no reinforcing weapons, ammunition, combat aircraft, or armored vehicles shall be brought into Korea from outside the country, and one of the duties of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is to supervise the observance of these provisions guaranteeing the armistice. Now, American warmongers and Syngman Rhee are openly calling for "equipping" Syngman Rhee's army "with new-type weapons" and turning South Korea into a permanent U.S. military base, in order to create new tensions in this region of the world. In this situation, the activities of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea, in accordance with the Armistice Agreement, cannot but become a thorn in the side of the warmongers.

    The conspiracy of American warmongers and the Syngman Rhee clique to undermine the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has a long history. The United States has repeatedly made unilateral demands to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The Syngman Rhee group has even shamelessly resorted to violence against the personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, obstructing the work of the commission in every possible way. It is worth noting that this conspiracy to undermine the armistice agreement has not only aroused opposition and condemnation from peace-loving people around the world, but also increasingly provoked open dissatisfaction and resistance from the people of South Korea, who have been living under Syngman Rhee's long-term reign of terror by secret agents and police. In the recent farce of Syngman Rhee's so-called "presidential election," the people of South Korea held a mass rally of 150,000 people in Seoul to oppose Syngman Rhee, as well as demonstrations of 10,000 to 20,000 people, which was by no means accidental. It is the most unambiguous expression of the South Korean people's deep hatred for Syngman Rhee's reactionary rule and war policy. The United Press International reported from Seoul on May 14th that "today in Seoul, South Korea, the sentiment widely opposed to President Syngman Rhee's eight-year rule of South Korea is very strong and openly expressed." Various opposition parties in South Korea also put forward slogans and programs in the "election" such as: "We cannot continue to live like this, now is the time for change"; "Maintain friendly relations with neighboring countries - including Communist North Korea and Japan"; "Unify Korea through peaceful means," which to some extent reflects the strong desire of the South Korean people today for peaceful reunification of the motherland and opposition to the US-Syngman Rhee clique's sabotage of the armistice agreement and creation of tensions.

    All peace-loving people in the world must remain vigilant to prevent new conspiracies by the US-Syngman Rhee warmongers to undermine the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission; all far-sighted governments and people should also see that it would be unwise and dangerous to support the bellicose policies of a Syngman Rhee clique that is deeply hated by the local people. The Chinese people will forever stand with the Korean people to fight against the sabotage of the armistice agreement and the intensification of tensions in Korea, and will resolutely strive for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful settlement of the Korean question.

### 警惕美李破坏朝鲜停战协定的新阴谋

    警惕美李破坏朝鲜停战协定的新阴谋
    据美国通讯社的报道，在侵朝十六个国家五月四日起在华盛顿举行的会议中，美国要求“大大限制朝鲜中立国监察委员会的活动范围”乃至于“结束这一委员会的事实上的活动”。就在这个时候，李承晚在南朝鲜再度叫嚣：在朝鲜作过战的盟国应当“宣布停战无效”，中立国监察委员会应当被“赶出”朝鲜。美国国防部副部长罗伯逊还在汉城露骨地宣告：“在可以预见的将来，将不会再有美军撤出朝鲜”，又说：“华盛顿正在讨论用新式武器装备大韩民国陆军的建议”。
    这种好战的叫嚣清楚地暴露了美国进一步破坏朝鲜中立国监察委员会的意图。朝鲜停战协定明白规定不得自朝鲜境外运入增援性的武器弹药、作战飞机和装甲车辆，而中立国监察委员会的职责之一就是要监督这些保证停战的条款得到遵守。现在美国好战分子和李承晚明目张胆地要“用新式武器装备”李承晚的军队，要把南朝鲜作为美国的永久军事基地，以便在世界的这一地区制造新的紧张局势。在这种情况下，中立国监察委员会按照停战协定在朝鲜的活动就不能不成为好战分子的眼中钉。
    美国的好战分子和李承晚之流破坏中立国监察委员会的阴谋是由来已久了。美国曾经不断提出片面取消中立国监察委员会的叫嚣。李承晚集团对于中立国监察委员会的人员甚至无耻地采用了暴力，百般阻挠委员会的工作。值得注意的是，这种破坏停战协定的阴谋不仅引起了全世界爱好和平的人民的反对和谴责，而且在李承晚长期的特务、警察恐怖统治之下的南朝鲜人民也日益表示出公开的不满和反抗。在这一次李承晚的所谓“选举总统”的丑剧中，南朝鲜人民在汉城举行了十五万人的反对李承晚大集会和一、二万人的游行示威，这决不是偶然的。它是南朝鲜人民对李承晚的反动统治和战争政策深恶痛绝最明白无误的表示。美国的国际新闻社五月十四日从汉城报道说，“今天在南朝鲜的汉城，普遍反对李承晚总统对南朝鲜的八年统治的情绪十分强烈而且见之于辞色。”南朝鲜的各个反对党派也在“竞选”中纷纷提出了：“我们不能继续这样生活下去，现在是改变的时候到了”；“同邻国——包括共产党北朝鲜和日本——保持友好关系”；“通过和平方法统一朝鲜”等口号和纲领，在某种程度上反映出今天南朝鲜人民要求和平统一祖国、反对美李破坏停战协定和制造紧张局势的强烈愿望。
    世界上一切爱好和平的人民还必须提高警惕以防止美李好战分子破坏中立国监察委员会的新阴谋；一切有远见的政府和人士也应该看到：支持一个当地人民所深恶痛绝的李承晚集团的好战政策将是不智的和危险的。中国人民将永远和朝鲜人民一道为反对破坏停战协定，反对加剧朝鲜的紧张局势而斗争，并将坚决为争取从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队和和平解决朝鲜问题而奋斗。
