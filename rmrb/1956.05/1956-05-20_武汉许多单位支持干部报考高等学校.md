The Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission has already approved 51 cadres to apply for universities and has established remedial classes for them.

In Wuhan, the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission is not the only unit that enthusiastically supports cadres currently employed to apply for universities. The General Office of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has four cadres preparing to apply for universities. In addition to supporting their enrollment in remedial classes, the leadership has also designated specific personnel for tutoring. To ensure that cadres applying for the exam have time to study, the Wuhan First Commercial Bureau has readjusted work arrangements and reduced the time they spend on social activities. The Hubei Provincial Culture Bureau has also specially vacated rooms for cadres in their unit who are applying for the exam to review their lessons.

Wuhan University, Huazhong Institute of Technology, and other schools have also approved a group of cadres from their own schools who applied to take the university entrance examination. Li Da, the president of Wuhan University, once mobilized cadres who met the application requirements. The cadres who have been approved to apply are now organized into groups according to their chosen majors for remedial study. In addition to reducing the part-time work of teachers applying for the exam, the Hubei Provincial Cadre Children's School has also properly arranged teaching time so that they can both guarantee teaching and review their lessons well.

Currently, the number of remedial classes opened in the Wuhan area for government cadres and young people in society preparing to apply for universities has increased from five to nine, and two more are being prepared, ready to start classes soon.

    武汉许多单位支持干部报考高等学校
    长江水利委员会已经批准了五十一名干部报考高等学校，并且为他们成立了补习班。
    像长江水利委员会热情赞助在职干部报考的单位在武汉还不止一个。中共湖北省委员会办公厅有四名干部准备报考高等学校，领导上除了支持他们进补习班外，还指定了专人辅导。武汉市第一商业局为保证报考干部的温课时间，重新调整了工作，并且减少他们参加社会活动的时间。湖北省文化局还为本单位报考的干部专门腾出了复习功课的房间。
    武汉大学、华中工学院等学校也批准了一批本校申请报考的干部报考高等学校。武汉大学校长李达曾经对符合报考条件的干部作了动员。这个学校被批准报考的干部现在已经按报考志愿编成小组进行补习。湖北省干部子弟学校除了减去报考教师的兼职外，还妥善地安排了教学时间，使他们既能保证教学，又能温好功课。
    目前，武汉地区为准备投考高等学校的机关干部和社会青年开办的补习班已经由五个增加到九个，还有两个正在筹备中，准备最近开课。
