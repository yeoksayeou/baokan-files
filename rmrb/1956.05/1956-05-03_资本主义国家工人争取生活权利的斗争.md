　　Workers' Struggle for Living Rights in Capitalist Countries
    Zhou Meisheng
    In capitalist countries, the lives of the working masses are becoming increasingly difficult due to the monopoly capitalist groups intensifying their exploitation of the proletariat and the heavy burden brought about by the arms race and war preparations policy. Rising prices and surging taxes have significantly reduced the real wages of workers in capitalist countries compared to pre-war levels. Currently, the real wages of American workers are 30% lower than before the war, Britain is down 33%, France is down 50%, Italy is down approximately 50%, and Japan is down by one-third. The decline in real wages has continuously worsened the lives of workers. Today, the monthly wages of one-third of French workers are not enough to maintain their minimum living standards. The nutrition of the British working people is not even up to the level of 1935. In the United States, more than two-thirds of families do not earn enough annual income to cover their minimum living expenses.
    Monopoly capital continuously intensifies its exploitation of workers by extending working hours and increasing labor intensity, severely damaging workers' health and shortening their lifespans. Extended working hours have become a very common phenomenon. From 1948 to 1954, the weekly working hours of West German workers increased by seven hours, Britain by two hours, and Japan by four hours. At the same time, the intensity of labor has also increased unprecedentedly. Long hours of strenuous labor leave workers exhausted, and coupled with poor working conditions, the number of industrial accidents in capitalist countries' enterprises is constantly increasing, and the phenomena of worker illness and premature aging are becoming increasingly serious. In 1954, West Germany had two million industrial accidents, which is higher than any year in pre-war Germany. Today, half of the 55-year-old workers in West Germany have lost their ability to work. The United States also has two million industrial accidents each year, and the number of workers suffering from nervous disorders is increasing. In the United States, it is already difficult for women over 35 and men over 45 to find work.
    The existence of a large army of unemployed is powerful evidence of the impoverishment of the working people in capitalist countries. In 1955, according to official figures, the number of fully unemployed people in the United States was about three million, and the number of partially unemployed was more than nine million. West Germany had one million fully unemployed. Italy had two million fully unemployed, and another two million partially unemployed. According to official statistics, Japan had 750,000 fully unemployed people in February of this year, an increase of 90,000 from the same period last year. The number of partially unemployed people is estimated to be over ten million. This serious unemployment not only causes deep suffering to millions upon millions of laborers, but also affects the living standards of all employed workers.
    In order to oppose the attacks of monopoly capital and defend their right to survival, workers have waged heroic struggles. In the past year or so, there has been a new upsurge in strike movements against capitalist exploitation and to fight for their living rights. In Britain, the scale of strikes in 1955 was unprecedented in 23 years, and the number of working days lost due to strikes increased by 54% compared to 1954. In 1955, the United States had 4,200 strikes, an increase of 20% compared to 1954; the number of participants in the strikes reached 2.75 million, an increase of 80% compared to 1954. In France, 2.9 million working days were lost due to strikes in 1955, more than double the amount in 1954. More than three million workers in Japan have been carrying out a massive national struggle to demand wage increases since February of this year. This struggle has lasted for several months and is one of the largest struggles in recent years. In the first quarter of this year, more than one million workers in Italy went on strike. In West Germany, Finland, Denmark, Spain, and other capitalist countries, worker strike movements are also flourishing and widely developing.
    The strike movements in capitalist countries at the current stage have all had the characteristics of sharp and sustained struggles in recent years. The working class has demonstrated a highly tenacious fighting spirit. The great strike of 70,000 train drivers and stokers in Britain, which began on May 28, 1955, lasted for three weeks, causing serious paralysis of British railway transportation. Although the British government declared a national "state of emergency" and threatened and suppressed the strikers, it could not destroy the striking workers' fighting will in the slightest. The strikers finally achieved victory and achieved the goal of increasing wages. The strike struggle of 44,000 electrical workers at the Westinghouse Electric Company in the United States, which began in October of last year, lasted for more than five months and only ended after achieving victory at the end of March of this year. The situation in countries such as Japan, France, and Italy is also similar.
    In the struggle to win common and vital interests, the unity of the working class has been greatly strengthened. In the 1955 strike movement in France, the actions of the lower-level organizations of the three main trade union factions—the General Confederation of Labor, the Catholic Labor Confederation, and the General Confederation of Workers' Forces—became increasingly consistent. The strike of southern railway workers in the United States in the spring of 1955 was attended by ten different trade unions, which eliminated differences under common interests and goals and took unified action. Due to the increasingly strong demands of the working masses, the two largest trade union federations in the United States—the AFL and the CIO—which had been split for twenty years, merged last year. The Sixth Congress of the largest trade union organization in Japan—the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan—held in July of last year, paid special attention to the issue of trade union unity and decided to strengthen the unity of the working class as one of the guiding principles for future work. Due to the development of the current international situation, greater possibilities have emerged for expanding and strengthening the unity of the working class.
    In recent strike movements, the tenacious struggle and unified action of the working class have often forced business owners to make concessions. In 1955, as a result of the strike struggles, the wages of five million workers and staff in France were increased, and capitalists in many industrial sectors in the United States were also forced to increase workers' wages. The railway workers and printing workers in Britain both achieved complete victory in their strikes last year. The strike held by coal miners of thirteen large coal mining companies in Japan in March of this year also achieved the demand for wage increases.
    The workers of capitalist countries are increasingly aware that merely engaging in economic struggles cannot eliminate the root causes of their impoverishment. More and more workers are becoming involved in the struggle for lasting peace, for democratic freedoms and social reforms. In recent years, the struggle of workers in capitalist countries for living rights has become more and more closely linked with the struggle of the masses of people in various countries against arms expansion and war preparations, demanding arms reduction, banning atomic weapons, and striving to ease international tensions. The rising political activism and growing strength of workers in capitalist countries have enabled them to play an increasingly greater role in international political life.

　　资本主义国家工人争取生活权利的斗争
    周梅生
    在资本主义国家，由于垄断资本集团对无产阶级加紧进行剥削，由于扩军备战政策所带来的沉重负担，工人群众的生活越来越困苦。物价上涨和赋税激增，已使得资本主义国家工人的实际工资比战前大大地降低了。目前美国工人的实际工资比战前降低了30％，英国降低了33％，法国降低了50％，意大利降低了约50％，日本则降低了三分之一。实际工资的降低使工人生活不断恶化。今天法国三分之一的工人每月的工资不够维持本人的最低生活。英国劳动人民的营养还比不上1935年的水平。在美国，三分之二以上的家庭每年收入不够最低的生活费用需要。
    垄断资本用延长工作日和提高劳动强度的办法不断加强对工人的剥削，严重地摧毁了工人的健康，缩短了他们的寿命。工作时间延长成为很普遍的现象。从1948年到1954年，西德工人每周工作时间增加了七小时，英国增加了二小时，日本增加了四小时。同时劳动的强度也空前增加。长时间的紧张劳动使工人精疲力尽，加上劳动条件恶劣，资本主义国家企业中的生产事故不断增加，工人疾病和未老先衰的现象日益严重。1954年西德发生的生产事故达二百万起，比战前整个德国任何一年的数字都高。今天西德五十五岁的工人中，有一半已经丧失了劳动能力。美国每年发生的生产事故也达到二百万起，患神经性疾病的工人日益增加。在美国，三十五岁以上的女子和四十五岁以上的男子已经很难找到工作了。
    失业大军的存在，是资本主义国家劳动人民贫困化的有力证据。在1955年，根据官方发表的数字，美国完全失业的人数约三百万人，半失业的达九百万人以上。西德有一百万人完全失业。意大利完全失业的达二百万人，另外还有同样多的半失业的人。据官方统计，日本今年二月份完全失业的有七十五万人，比去年同期增加九万人。半失业的人数估计在一千万以上。这种严重的失业现象不仅使千千万万的劳动者遭受深重的灾难，而且还影响了全体在业工人的生活水平。
    为了反对垄断资本的进攻、保卫自己的生存权利，工人进行了英勇的斗争。最近一年多以来，为反对资本家的剥削和争取自己的生活权利的罢工运动，出现了新的高涨。在英国，1955年的罢工规模是二十三年来空前未有的，因罢工而损失的工作日比1954年增加54％。1955年美国发生了4，200次罢工，比1954年增加20％；参加罢工的人数达275万人，比1954年增加80％。法国1955年因罢工而损失的工作日达290万个，比1954年增加了一倍多。日本三百多万工人从今年二月起进行了声势浩大的春季要求提高工资的全国性斗争。这一斗争延续了几个月，是近年来规模最大的斗争之一。今年第一季度意大利有一百多万工人举行了罢工。在西德、芬兰、丹麦、西班牙和其他资本主义国家中，工人罢工运动也在蓬勃地广泛地开展。
    资本主义国家现阶段的罢工运动，近年来都具有斗争尖锐和持续长久的特点。工人阶级表现了高度顽强的战斗精神。1955年5月28日开始的英国七万名火车司机和司炉的大罢工坚持了三个星期之久，使英国的铁路运输陷入了严重的瘫痪状态。尽管英国政府宣布全国进入“紧急状态”，对罢工者实行威胁和镇压，但是丝毫不能摧毁罢工工人的斗争意志。罢工者终于取得了胜利，达到了提高工资的目的。美国威斯汀豪斯电气公司的四万四千名电气工人从去年十月起开始的罢工斗争坚持了五个多月，到今年三月底获得胜利后才结束。在日本、法国和意大利等国家情形也是如此。
    在争取共同的切身利益的斗争中，工人阶级的团结有了很大的加强。在1955年法国的罢工运动中，三个主要工会派别——法国总工会、天主教劳工联盟、工人力量总工会——的下层组织之间的行动越来越趋于一致。1955年春发生的美国南部铁路工人的罢工，有十个不同的工会参加，他们在共同的利益和目标下消除了分歧，采取了统一的行动。由于工人群众日益强烈的要求，分裂了二十年的美国两个最大的工会联合会——劳联和产联在去年实行了合并。日本最大的工会组织——日本工会总评议会去年七月举行的第六次代表大会特别注意了工会团结问题，并决定把加强工人阶级的团结作为今后工作的方针之一。由于目前国际形势的发展，扩大和加强工人阶级的团结已经出现了更大的可能。
    在近年来的罢工运动中，工人阶级的顽强斗争和统一行动，常常迫使企业主作了让步。在1955年，由于罢工斗争的结果，法国有五百万工人和职员的工资提高了，美国许多工业部门的资本家也被迫提高了工人的工资。英国铁路工人和印刷工人去年进行的罢工都获得完全的胜利。今年三月间日本十三家大煤矿公司的煤矿工人举行的罢工，也达到了增加工资的要求。
    资本主义国家的工人们日益了解到，仅仅进行经济斗争不能消除他们贫困化的根源。越来越多的工人卷入了争取持久和平、争取民主自由和社会改革的斗争。近年来，资本主义国家工人争取生活权利的斗争同各国人民群众反对扩军备战、要求裁减军备、禁止原子武器和争取缓和国际紧张局势的斗争愈来愈紧密地结合在一起。资本主义国家工人政治积极性的高涨和力量的壮大，已经使他们在国际政治生活方面发生愈来愈大的作用。
