The US Slanders China for Implementing "Forced Labor"
Readers Cannot Suppress Their Inner Anger
The Government Transformed Me from a Useless Person into a Glorious Laborer

To the Editor:
The United Nations Economic and Social Council's 21st session discussing the so-called "forced labor" issue in China is a slander against the Chinese people by American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, a deliberate defamation against our people. I cannot suppress my inner anger at this slander. I want to say a few words.

I am a person who has personally experienced the warmth of the labor reform policy. The government transformed me from a useless person into a glorious laborer who supports himself. In reform education, I not only improved my cultural learning and political understanding, but also learned labor skills. After completing the reform education, I quickly found a suitable job.

The criminals who are supervised have violated national laws or harmed the interests of the people. However, in order to save them and transform them into useful talents, the government organizes criminals to learn production skills and conduct cultural education. After being reformed, criminals become self-reliant labor citizens in society, and they have the opportunity to participate in the work of various production departments and become personnel for building the motherland. Is this "forced labor"?

Our prisons today have none of the dark practices of old prisons. Prisoners will not be beaten with rubber whips wrapped in steel wire, nor will they be subjected to extortion by wardens and guards. The government staff here are full of a high degree of revolutionary humanitarianism and patiently conduct persuasion and education to the prisoners. The government takes meticulous care of the criminals. Criminals can often read newspapers and magazines; the food is constantly improving; and there are also clinics to provide free medical treatment for criminals. Criminals can also see dramas and movies every month. Those who have visited labor reform sites feel that they are not like prisons at all, but simply large factories; seeing the scene of happy work on the labor site, they do not feel any "forced" atmosphere at all.

Seeing people say that we are forcing labor, I can't help but feel angry and want to say a few words from the heart.

I protest against the slander of our country by American imperialism. I will answer them with double the effort in labor.

The American Smear Against China is Ridiculous and Shameful

To the Editor:

Seeing in the newspaper that the US government, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions said at the 21st session of the United Nations Economic and Social Council that our labor reform policy is so-called "forced labor," this is obviously their fabrication and slander.

I am a woman who once made serious mistakes due to ignorance and was sentenced and sent to labor reform. During the period of labor reform, I realized the new society from actual life. At the same time, I also saw many women who had been depraved and committed crimes in the old society become two different people before and after labor reform, their thoughts turned towards truth, and their bodies became healthy and energetic.

The prisons of New China are humane. During labor, it is based on each person's physical strength, opposing the competition of physical strength and rewarding no work-related injuries. I am the least able to work, but I try my best to learn to work. The government did not force me to work, but instead warmly took care of my physical strength everywhere.

The cadres who manage female prisoners treat us like a mother cares for her children, caring about whether the prisoners are properly covered at night in winter, and caring about whether there are mosquitoes in summer; and often spraying medicine to eliminate mosquitoes. Every month, the government issues various daily necessities, and also lets us watch plays and dramas. This kind of life and this kind of warm education move the criminals to hate their crimes and consciously strive to be a new person.

American imperialism describes the virtue of labor advocated by New China as "forced labor," this slander is ridiculous and shameful. Under the capitalist system, the people live in poverty, and there is no way to survive without being forced to work for the exploiters. Our country is pulling the people's lives out of poverty so that the people can enjoy the fruits of labor. There is a world of difference between the two.

Why Does the United States Always Turn Our Good Deeds into Bad Deeds?

To the Editor:

I am a Li youth, I love the motherland, and I love the People's Government. When I saw in the newspaper that the US government slandered our labor reform policy as "forced labor," I felt very angry.

Our government's labor reform of criminals to turn them into useful people in the new society is the most humanitarian education method. It has won the support and support of the people of the whole country. But the American ruling group describes this fair practice as "forced labor," which is a slanderous and defamatory lie.

The American ruling group slanders the Chinese people in this way because the 600 million Chinese people who have stood up firmly stand on the side of the socialist camp of defending world peace, and have achieved brilliant victories in the cause of building their great motherland. Peace-loving people all over the world sympathize with and support us. All this makes the American ruling group afraid. They are afraid that this will shake their control over some countries, so they are trying their best to turn the good deeds of the Chinese people into bad deeds in all aspects. The so-called "forced labor" is one of the lies manufactured for this purpose. We resolutely oppose this slander.

### 美国诬蔑我国实行“强迫劳动”　读者禁不住内心的愤怒

　　美国诬蔑我国实行“强迫劳动”
　　读者禁不住内心的愤怒
　　政府把我由废人改造成一个光荣的劳动者
　　编辑同志：
    联合国经社理事会第二十一届会议讨论所谓我国实行“强迫劳动”的问题，是美帝国主义及蒋介石集团对中国人民的一种诬蔑，是别有用心地对我国人民进行的诽谤。对于这种诬蔑，我禁不住内心的愤怒。我要说几句话。
    我是一个亲身体会到劳动改造政策的温暖的人。政府把我由一个废人改造成为一个自食其力的光荣的劳动者。我在改造教育中，不但提高了文化学习与政治认识，而且也学会了劳动技术。改造教育完了之后，我很快就找到了适当的职业。
    被监管起来的罪犯们都是触犯国家法律或危害人民群众利益的。但是政府为了挽救他们，把他们改造成为有用的人才，就组织罪犯们学习生产技术，进行文化教育。罪犯在改造之后就在社会上成为自食其力的劳动公民，他们有机会参加各个生产部门的工作，成为建设祖国的人员。难道这是“强迫劳动”吗？
    我们今天的监狱丝毫没有旧监狱中的黑暗作风。犯人不会挨到包着钢丝的橡皮鞭子，也不会遭受典狱长、看守们的敲诈勒索。这里的政府工作人员充满了高度革命人道主义精神，耐心地向犯人们进行说服教育。政府对罪犯照顾得无微不至。罪犯经常可以阅读书报杂志；伙食不断改善；还有医务所为罪犯们免费医病。犯人每月还可以看到戏剧和电影。到劳动改造场所看过的人，都感到那里根本不像监狱，简直是个大工厂；看到在劳动现场中愉快工作的情景，丝毫感觉不到有“强迫”气息。
    看到人家说我们强迫劳动，我禁不住内心的愤怒，要说几句心里的话。
    我抗议美帝国主义对我国的诽谤。我要以加倍的劲头进行劳动来给他们以回答。

    美国对中国的诬蔑可笑可耻
　　编辑同志：
    从报上看到美国政府，蒋介石集团和国际自由工会联合会在联合国经社理事会第二十一届会议上说我国的劳动改造政策是所谓“强迫劳动”，这明显的是他们的捏造和诽谤。
    我是一个妇女，曾因无知犯了严重错误，被判罪送去劳动改造。在劳动改造期中使我从实际生活认识到新社会。同时我还看到许多在旧社会中堕落犯罪的妇女，通过劳动改造前后变成两个人，思想转变得趋向真理，肉体变成健康有劲。
    新中国的监狱是讲人道的。劳动时按照每人的体力大小，反对拼体力，奖励不发生工伤事故。我是最不会劳动的，但我却是尽力学习劳动。政府并没有强迫我劳动，反而处处温暖地照顾我的体力。
    管理女犯的干部对待我们真像一个母亲关怀自己的孩子一样，冬天夜里关心犯人们是否盖好被子，夏天关心是否有蚊虫；并且经常来喷射药水消灭蚊虫。每月政府发给各种日用品，还给我们看戏，看话剧。这种生活、这种温暖的教育感动罪犯恨恶自己的罪行，而自觉地努力作个新的人。
    美帝国主义把新中国提倡劳动的美德说成是“强迫劳动”，这种诬蔑是可笑可耻的。在资本主义制度下，人民生活在贫苦中，不被迫为剥削者劳动就没有生路，我国是把人民生活从贫苦中拔出来，使人民能享受劳动的果实。两者有天壤之别。

　　为什么美国总要把我们的好事说成坏事
　　编辑同志：
    我是一个黎族青年，我热爱祖国，热爱人民政府。我从报上看到美国政府把我国劳动改造的政策诬蔑为“强迫劳动”时，我感到很愤怒。
    我国政府把罪犯进行劳动改造，使他们变成新社会有用的人，这是最人道主义的教育方法。它获得全国人民的支持和拥护。但是美国统治集团却把这种公道的作法说成是“强迫劳动”，这是一种诬蔑和诽谤的谎言。
    美国的统治集团这样诬蔑中国人民，是因为已经站起来的六万万中国人民坚决站在保卫世界和平的社会主义阵营方面，而且在建设自己伟大的祖国的事业中已取得了辉煌的胜利，全世界爱好和平的人民都同情和支持我们，这一切使得美国统治集团害怕。他们害怕这会动摇他们对有些国家的控制，因此他们千方百计想从各方面来把中国人民的好事都说成是坏事，所谓“强迫劳动”就是为了这个目的制造出来的谎言之一。我们坚决反对这种诽谤。
