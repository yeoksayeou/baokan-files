　　Motorcycle Off-Road Race Held in the Capital
    The Central National Defense Sports Club held a motorcycle off-road selection race in Beijing on the 6th. Seventeen male athletes and seven female athletes selected from Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Harbin, Chongqing and other places participated in the men's 100-kilometer and women's 60-kilometer off-road races respectively.
    The male and female athletes drove motorcycles with four different cylinder capacities, and passed through many complex terrains at high speed along the prescribed route – steep slopes of about 75 degrees and nine meters long, waterlogged areas 30 centimeters deep, gravel paths and sharp turning areas. One section required the athletes to drive their motorcycles up and down mountains five or sixty meters high.
    If a motorcycle broke down during the race, the athletes had to repair it themselves.
    The athletes who won the competition were Liu Heli, Zhang Huatang, Li Pu, Gao Zhiping, and Li Shutian. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　首都举行摩托车越野比赛
    中央国防体育俱乐部六日在北京举办了摩托车越野选拔赛。从北京、天津、沈阳、哈尔滨、重庆等地选拔出来的十七名男运动员和七名女运动员，分别参加了男子组一百公里和女子组六十公里的越野比赛。
    男、女运动员分别驾驶着四种气缸容积不同的摩托车，按照规定的路线高速度地通过了许多复杂的地形——九公尺长的七十五度左右的陡坡、三十公分深的水汪地带、碎石小路和急转弯的地区。其中有一段地区是要求运动员们在五、六十公尺高的山地上驾驶着摩托车上来下去的。
    摩托车如果在途中发生了故障，都要由运动员们自己修理。
    在这次比赛中，取得优胜的运动员有刘和立、张华堂、李溥、高志平、李树田。　（据新华社讯）
