Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 13th: Seoul dispatch: South Korea's Syngman Rhee clamored again on May 10th to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and "declare the armistice invalid," and also demanded that the Kaesong area and Ongjin Peninsula south of the 38th parallel, liberated by the Korean and Chinese side during the American war of aggression against Korea, be "returned" to him.

Prior to this, when answering questions from a United Press reporter on May 5th, Syngman Rhee also said that his "patience is running out, and it cannot be certain how long this patience can last"; he also proposed to give China some kind of "ultimatum," demanding that China unilaterally withdraw its troops from northern Korea.

The Korean Central News Agency said that Syngman Rhee, who is busy vying for the presidential seat, suddenly and continuously issued war cries, which are related to the US ruling clique's intensified implementation of a series of conspiracies to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement. The US authorities recently convened a meeting in Washington, pressing the sixteen countries participating in the war of aggression against Korea to agree to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission; US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee of the US Congress on May 7th, saying that the United States "may not be able to continue to abide by the terms of the Korean Armistice Agreement indefinitely."

    李承晚叫嚣要破坏停战协定
    新华社平壤13日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜的李承晚在五月十日又叫嚣要撤消中立国监察委员会和“宣布停战无效”，并且还要求将朝中方面在美国侵朝战争中解放的三八线以南的开城地区和瓮津半岛“归还”给他。
    在此以前，李承晚在五月五日回答合众社记者问题的时候还说他的“耐心快要完了，现在不能肯定这种耐心能支持多久”；他并且提出要给中国一份什么“最后通牒”，要求中国单方面撤退它在朝鲜北部的部队。
    朝鲜中央通讯社说，正在忙于抢夺总统位子的李承晚忽然连续发出战争叫嚣，和美国统治集团加紧推行一系列破坏朝鲜停战协定的阴谋有关。美国当局最近曾经在华盛顿召集会议，压迫十六个参加侵朝战争的国家同意取消中立国监察委员会；美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福五月七日在美国国会众议院外交委员会上作证时说：美国“也许不能无限期地继续遵守朝鲜停战协定的条款”。
