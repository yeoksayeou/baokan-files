    Yanchang Oil Mine completed its first Five-Year Plan's crude oil production target nineteen months and seven days ahead of schedule on May 22nd. The number of oil wells put into production by this oil mine this year has increased by 12.5% compared to last year. In order to increase crude oil production, oil extraction workers and technicians, through collective research, earnestly promoted the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In April, after a well adopted the oil-top blasting measure, the crude oil production exceeded more than ten times the March production.

    Through the efforts of the drilling workers, the drilling efficiency of many drilling rigs distributed around the mining area has also continuously improved, enabling several oil wells to be put into production early. According to the method of finding oil well locations suggested by Soviet experts, geological personnel recently found an oil well with very rich oil reserves. This oil well was put into production on May 8, and the oil production on that day exceeded twice the total daily output of all producing wells in the Yanchang area. (Xinhua News Agency)

    延长油矿提前完成五年原油生产任务
    延长油矿在五月二十二日提前十九个月零七天完成了第一个五年计划的原油生产任务。这个油矿今年投入生产的油井，比去年增加了12.5％。为了增加原油产量，采油工人和技术人员经过集体研究，认真推行了苏联的先进经验。四月间，有一口井采取了油顶爆炸的措施以后，原油产量超过了三月份产量的十倍以上。
    经过钻探工人的努力，分布矿区周围的许多钻机的钻进效率也不断提高，使得好几口油井提早投入了生产。地质人员根据苏联专家建议的找油井位置的方法，最近找到了一口储油非常丰富的油井。这口油井在五月八日已经投入生产，当天的油产量就超过了延长地区所有生产井日产量总和的两倍。　（新华社）
