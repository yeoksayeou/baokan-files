Xinhua News Agency, May 10th: According to a report by the Yugoslav News Agency, the Federal National Assembly of Yugoslavia convened in Belgrade on May 9th. One of the main items on the agenda of this meeting is to discuss the work of the Federal Executive Council in 1955.

    Vukmanović, Vice-President of the Federal Executive Council, pointed out in his speech that Yugoslavia's new economic policy has already yielded initial positive results. He said that the export volume in the first four months of this year increased by several billion dinars (Yugoslav currency) compared to the same period last year. The price level is the same as last autumn. The main difficulty lies in how to transform heavy industry to also produce consumer goods.

    Vukmanović pointed out that the Federal Executive Council will continue to work on formulating a long-term plan for economic development. He said that the plan includes issues such as: fully utilizing the production capacity of existing factories and enterprises, and renovating and modernizing industry according to the principle of maximizing national income growth with minimal investment. This plan will pay special attention to agriculture, market stabilization, and improving transportation.

    Vukmanović also mentioned that the Federal Executive Council will formulate a new wage system and revise the current foreign exchange system.

    At the meeting on this day, responsible officials of some newly established federal agencies were also appointed.
