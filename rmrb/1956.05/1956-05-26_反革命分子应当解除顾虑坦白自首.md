    Counter-Revolutionaries Should Dispel Concerns, Confess, and Surrender Themselves
    Recently, various localities, based on the policy of "leniency for confession, severity for resistance, meritorious service for atonement, and rewards for great contributions," have handled a batch of counter-revolutionary elements. The handling of these specific cases has made many counter-revolutionary elements more clearly understand the policies of the People's Government and recognize the path they should choose. Consequently, groups of counter-revolutionary elements, including many with serious crimes, have voluntarily confessed to the People's Government and admitted their guilt. Many have not only confessed their own crimes but have also actively reported other counter-revolutionary elements, and mobilized and persuaded other counter-revolutionary elements to confess to the People's Government. This shows that many counter-revolutionary elements have seen the situation clearly and have been touched by the People's Government's lenient policy. They have realized that only by confessing and surrendering can they receive lenient treatment, and that this is their only way out.
    However, there are still some counter-revolutionary elements who are still hesitating and have not promptly confessed to the People's Government. What are they hesitating about? They are both afraid of being severely punished for resistance and doubtful whether they will receive lenient treatment after confessing. Should they continue to conceal? Or should they confess and surrender? This question often troubles them. We must once again explain this clearly to these counter-revolutionary elements, so that they can dispel their concerns, confess, and surrender, and strive for lenient treatment.
    Some counter-revolutionary elements think this way: "My past crimes are too serious. I'm afraid that after confessing, I won't receive lenient treatment." Or they think: "I not only have historical crimes, but now I also have new crimes. My sins are deep. After confessing, can I receive lenient treatment?" Because of these concerns, they have stopped at the threshold of confession and surrender. In fact, these concerns are unnecessary. The People's Government's policy of "combining suppression and leniency" applies to all counter-revolutionary elements. It does not only apply to counter-revolutionary elements with general crimes, but not to those with serious crimes; nor does it only apply to counter-revolutionary elements with historical crimes, but not to current spies and secret agents. All counter-revolutionary elements, as long as they confess, thoroughly explain, and sincerely repent, can receive lenient treatment. Even those who have committed serious crimes and should be sentenced to death can avoid the death penalty as long as they thoroughly confess. Since you know that your crimes are serious, you should confess as early as possible to strive for a reduction in punishment. Otherwise, you will ultimately not escape the punishment of the people and will not receive leniency.
    Some counter-revolutionary elements think this way: "I've been hiding for too long. It's probably too late to confess now." In fact, this concern is also unnecessary. Since you know that hiding for a long time is not good, then you should immediately confess and surrender now. If you delay any longer, won't you be hiding for even longer? Of course, confessing early is better than confessing late, but confessing late is better than not confessing. As long as you confess to the People's Government in a timely manner, it is not too late, and you can still receive lenient treatment. The People's Government will give all redeemable counter-revolutionary elements the opportunity to confess and surrender. However, if some counter-revolutionary elements attempt to continue hiding, delaying the opportunity themselves, then it will truly be "too late" in the future.
    Some counter-revolutionary elements think this way: "Thorough confession can lead to lenient treatment, but will my job and my children's future be affected?" This is also an unnecessary concern. All counter-revolutionary elements who thoroughly confess and surrender, after receiving lenient treatment, the People's Government will never let them wander in society. For example, Article 5 of the Draft National Agricultural Development Program already stipulates the issue of counter-revolutionary elements' occupations. With the development of national construction, everyone who is willing to participate in labor will find suitable jobs and have opportunities for employment. This naturally also applies to counter-revolutionary elements who admit their guilt and are willing to reform themselves through labor. In fact, in handling cases of confessed and surrendered counter-revolutionary elements, those who had infiltrated internal organs and enterprises, as long as they thoroughly confessed and had meritorious service, did not lose their jobs as a result. Many people were still assigned certain jobs. Zhang Yi, a special agent who returned from Hong Kong to engage in subversive activities, was given leniency by the People's Government after surrendering himself and was given the opportunity to work. Of course, if a counter-revolutionary element who already has a job surrenders himself, the People's Government will not let him lose his job. So, the issue is very clear: if a counter-revolutionary element wants to obtain a proper job, if he wants not to lose his job, he must thoroughly confess and surrender, and truly abandon his reactionary stance. As for the children of counter-revolutionary elements, they originally have the same opportunities for education and employment as ordinary young people. As everyone knows, the People's Government's policy towards counter-revolutionary elements has never implicated the families of counter-revolutionary elements. After a counter-revolutionary element confesses and surrenders, and admits his guilt to the people, his children's future will certainly not be adversely affected.
    The People's Government's policy towards counter-revolutionary elements has always been a policy that combines suppression and leniency, allowing counter-revolutionary elements to confess and surrender, so that they can repent and start anew, and strive to be a new person. According to the policy of "leniency for confession, severity for resistance," the People's Government gives different treatment to counter-revolutionary elements with different attitudes. Now, many counter-revolutionary elements have received lenient treatment because of their confession and surrender. All counter-revolutionary elements who have doubts and have not confessed should no longer hesitate, and quickly confess and surrender! Continuing to delay will only increase your own pain and guilt in vain, and will not bring any benefits. It should be pointed out here: There will still be die-hard counter-revolutionary elements who refuse to repent. Die-hard counter-revolutionary elements are not willing to easily abandon their reactionary stance, and they will stubbornly carry out counter-revolutionary activities. What should be done with such counter-revolutionary elements? The solution is: arrest them according to law and severely punish them. Now, two very clear paths are placed before the counter-revolutionary elements. All counter-revolutionary elements who are willing to repent and start anew should quickly decide which path they should take.

### 反革命分子应当解除顾虑坦白自首

    反革命分子应当解除顾虑坦白自首
    最近期间，各地根据“坦白从宽、抗拒从严、立功赎罪、立大功受奖”的政策，分别处理了一批反革命分子。通过这些具体案件的处理，使得许多反革命分子更加清楚地了解了人民政府的政策，认清了应当选择的道路。因而，成批的反革命分子，包括许多有严重罪行的反革命分子，都自动向人民政府坦白自首，低头认罪。不少的人不仅交代了自己的罪恶，而且积极检举其他反革命分子，动员和劝说其他反革命分子向人民政府坦白自首。这说明许多反革命分子已经看清形势并受到人民政府宽大政策的感召，他们已经认识到：只有坦白自首，才能得到宽大处理，才是自己唯一的出路。
    但是，也还是有一些反革命分子仍然徘徊、犹豫，没有及时向人民政府坦白自首。他们犹豫什么呢？他们既害怕因为抗拒受到从严的处理，又怀疑坦白自首以后是否会得到宽大处理。究竟是继续隐瞒呢？还是坦白自首呢？这个问题经常苦恼着他们。我们要向这样一些反革命分子再一次解释清楚，让他们解除顾虑，坦白自首，争取得到宽大的处理。
    有的反革命分子这样想：“自己过去的罪恶太重了，恐怕坦白自首以后，得不到宽大处理。”或者想：“自己不仅有历史罪行，现在还有新的罪行，罪恶深重，坦白自首后，能得到宽大处理吗？”由于有这些顾虑，所以，他们在坦白自首的门槛上停止了脚步。其实，这些顾虑都是多余的。人民政府的“镇压与宽大相结合”的政策，对于一切反革命分子，都是适用的，并不是只对有一般罪行的反革命分子适用，对罪恶重大的就不适用；也不是只对有历史罪行的反革命分子适用，对派遣潜伏的现行间谍特务分子就不适用。一切反革命分子，只要坦白自首、彻底交代、真诚悔过，都可以得到宽大处理。即使罪恶严重应该判处死刑的人，只要彻底坦白，就可以不判死刑。既然你知道罪恶重，那就更应该及早自首，争取减罪，否则也终究逃不脱人民的惩罚，得不到宽大。
    有的反革命分子这样想：“隐瞒得太久了，现在坦白自首，恐怕为时已晚。”其实，这种顾虑也是多余的。既然你知道隐瞒久了不好，那么，现在就应该立即坦白自首，再拖下去，不就隐瞒得更久了吗？当然，早坦白比晚坦白好，但是，晚坦白比不坦白好。只要你及时向人民政府坦白，也并不算晚，也还可以得到宽大处理。人民政府是会给一切可以争取挽救的反革命分子以坦白自首的机会的。但是，如果有的反革命分子企图继续隐瞒下去，自己贻误时机，将来就真的会“为时已晚”了。
    有的反革命分子这样想：“彻底坦白可以得到宽大处理，可是自己的职业、子女的前途，会不会受到影响呢？”这也是不必要的顾虑。一切彻底坦白自首的反革命分子，当他获得宽大处理以后，人民政府决不会让他在社会上流浪。比如在农业发展纲要草案的第五条中，对反革命分子的职业问题就已经做了规定。随着国家建设事业的发展，一切愿意参加劳动的人，都会找到适当的工作岗位，都会有劳动就业的机会。对于低头认罪愿意从劳动中改造自己的反革命分子，自然也不例外。事实上，在处理坦白自首的反革命分子案件中，对于那些混入机关企业内部的反革命分子，只要是彻底坦白自首且有立功表现者，并没有因而失业，有许多人仍然分配了一定的工作。从香港回来潜伏的特务分子张毅，投案自首以后，人民政府宽大了他，并且给了他就业的机会。当然已经有职业的反革命分子投案自首以后，人民政府更不会让他失业的。所以，问题很明白，反革命分子要想获得一个正当的职业，要想不失业，就必须彻底坦白自首，真正的放弃反动立场。至于反革命分子的子女，他们本来就和一般青年有同样就学、就业的机会，大家知道，人民政府对待反革命分子的政策，从来就是不株连反革命分子的家属的。反革命分子坦白自首，向人民低头认罪以后，他的子女的前途当然更不会受到不利的影响。
    人民政府对反革命分子的政策从来都是镇压和宽大相结合的政策，允许反革命分子坦白自首，让他们能够悔罪自新，争取重新做人。根据“坦白从宽、抗拒从严”的政策，人民政府对不同态度的反革命分子给予不同的对待。现在，已经有不少的反革命分子都因坦白自首获得了宽大处理。一切心存疑虑、没有坦白的反革命分子不要再犹豫了，赶快坦白自首吧！继续拖延，不过是徒然地增加自己的痛苦和罪恶，是不能得到任何好处的。这里应当指出：不肯悔悟的坚决的反革命分子，还是会有的，坚决的反革命分子是不肯轻易放弃他们的反动立场的，他们将怙恶不悛地进行反革命活动。对于这样的反革命分子，应该怎样办呢？办法就是：依法逮捕，严厉惩办。现在，很明显的两条道路摆在反革命分子面前，一切愿意悔过自新的反革命分子，应当迅速地决定自己所应走的道路。
