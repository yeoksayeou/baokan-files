Southern farmers are actively engaged in activities to prevent and control insect pests such as wheat thrips, cotton aphids, and rice stem borers.

    Agricultural cooperatives in Huaiyin, Jiangsu Province, and other areas, following the planting plan, have uniformly prepared the pesticide-treated grains and distributed them to smaller teams for application. Many agricultural cooperatives have also developed comprehensive plans for pest control. In Siyang County, Huaiyin Prefecture, 414 advanced cooperatives plan to prevent and control underground pests on 1.21 million mu of land during the spring and summer seasons. Corn and cotton will also be comprehensively treated, ensuring that every mu is protected. In many areas of Zhejiang Province, agricultural cooperatives deposit their cotton pre-purchase deposits with supply and marketing cooperatives to order pesticides and equipment. They also include pest control medication in their production plans, as part of their contracted work and production targets, and as a measure to increase production. Many farmers in Guangdong Province are also widely responding to the government's call to "prioritize prevention over treatment." During spring plowing, sowing, and transplanting, they generally use chemical seed soaking to achieve early prevention. Currently, in areas where stem borers occur in Shantou, Huiyang, Foshan and other regions, tens of thousands of farmers are mobilized daily, spraying pesticides during the day and lighting fires at night, carrying out prevention and control day and night.

    南方各地积极防治病虫害
    南方各地农民最近积极进行防治小麦吸浆虫、棉花蚜虫、水稻螟虫等虫害的活动。
    江苏省淮阴等地的农业合作社按照播种计划，把农药统一配制好毒谷，分到小队施用。许多农业合作社都作出了防治虫害的全面规划，淮阴专区泗阳县414个高级社，今年计划在春、夏两季防治地下害虫121万亩，玉米、棉花也都要全面防治，普遍都能做到有一亩防一亩。浙江省许多地区的农业合作社，把预购棉花的定金交给供销社，订购农药械；并且把治虫用药列入生产计划中，作为包工包产的内容和增产措施之一。广东省许多农民也普遍响应政府提出“防重于治”的号召，在春耕播种插秧中，一般都用药浸种，做到提前预防。目前汕头、惠阳、佛山等专区发生螟虫的地方，每天有成千上万的农民出动，白天喷药，晚上点灯燃火，昼夜进行防治。
