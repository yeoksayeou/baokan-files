    I Participated in the "May Day" Competition
　　Bulgarian Accessories Manufacturing Factory Rapid Lathe Worker Ilya Virbanov
    I have worked in the accessories manufacturing factory for many years. Our enterprise is not very large, but since 1950, it has been able to produce hundreds of spare parts for automobiles and tractors. This year, our country's import volume of these parts has been reduced to a minimum, which is largely due to the efforts of all employees of our factory.
    I am a lathe worker. I work in the lathe workshop. We try our best to maximize the production efficiency of the machines we oversee. We are always looking for new advanced experiences and applying them to our work. In our factory, there was a movement to learn the high-speed metal cutting method of Soviet lathe worker Vasily Kolesov. As soon as I learned about the content of this method from the Soviet newspapers, I immediately adopted the lathe tool with the geometric angle indicated by Kolesov. With the support of engineer Anton Antonov, I achieved results that had never been achieved in our machinery manufacturing industry. I increased the productivity of my lathe fourfold. This method was quickly learned by the comrades and quickly popularized throughout the country.
    This year, many advanced enterprises in our country issued a call to all workers in industry, construction, and transportation to participate in the struggle to improve labor productivity, reduce costs, and improve product quality. After discussing the call, our workshop proposed a guarantee: to complete the monthly plan three days ahead of schedule every month during this year, to only produce first-class quality parts, and to reduce the percentage of defective products.
    In order to realize this guarantee, experienced foremen started to teach young workers. And the young workers in our workshop account for 90% of all workers in the workshop. I started teaching young workers Mitogiyev, Tapiyeva, and Ruminov. They tirelessly improve their skills, increase the quantity of products, and improve the quality of products. At the same time, their wages are constantly increasing. For example, the wage of Georgi Mitogiyev in March of this year increased by 50% compared to his wage in December of last year. In March, the percentage of daily plans completed by no worker in the lathe workshop was less than 120%. In the socialist competition celebrating "May Day," the lathe workshop averaged 161% of the plan, the milling workshop - 148%, the fitter workshop - 174%, and so on. The work I personally completed in one shift is often 240% to 250% of the quota.
    At the beginning of this year, I made appropriate distribution of production processes in our workshop: each processing process is carried out by skilled and corresponding level workers. As a result, we eliminated the phenomenon of assigning general work to highly skilled workers as before, and reduced the price of products. My comrade Bogdan Panchev and I proposed a new method for turning a part of the main transmission device. Our rationalization proposal has been adopted into production. Due to the adoption of our rationalization proposal, not only labor productivity has been improved, but also the quality of the turned parts has been greatly improved.
    By frequently participating in socialist competitions and striving for the greatest labor victories, the workers of our accessories manufacturing factory are thus welcoming our greatest festival - the International Labor Day of solidarity of the working people of the world.

    我参加了“五一”节竞赛
　　保加利亚配件制造工厂快速旋工  伊里亚·维尔巴诺夫
    我在配件制造工厂工作了许多年。我们的企业规模不很大，但是从1950年起，它已经能够生产几百种汽车和拖拉机的配用零件。今年，我国这些零件的入口量减少到最小限度，这在很大程度上是我们工厂全体员工的功绩。
    我是一个旋工。我在旋工工段工作。我们尽力使我们所看管的机器发挥最大限度的生产效率，我们总是在寻求新的先进经验，而且把它们应用到我们的工作中去。在我们工厂里曾出现学习苏联旋工瓦希里·科列索夫的金属强力切削工作法的运动。我刚刚从苏联的报纸上知道了这种方法的内容，就立刻采用了科列索夫所指示的几何角度的车刀，在安东·安东诺夫工程师的支持下，达到了我们机器制造业中至今从未有过的成果。我把自己的旋床的生产率提高到四倍。这种方法很快地就被同志们学会了，并且很快普及到全国。
    今年，我国的许多先进企业对工业、建筑业和运输业的所有职工发出了号召，要他们参加争取提高劳动生产率、降低成本、改善产品质量的斗争。我们车间在讨论了号召以后提出保证：在今年一年当中每月都提前三天完成月计划，只出产优等质量的零件，并要降低废品的百分率。
    为了实现这个保证，有经验的工长就着手来教青年工人。而我们车间的青年工人占了全车间工人的90％。我开始教青年工人米托吉耶夫、塔皮耶娃、鲁敏诺夫。他们不倦地改进着自己的技巧，增加产品的数量并提高产品的质量。同时，他们的工资也在不断地提高。例如，格奥尔吉·米托吉耶夫今年三月的工资比去年十二月的工资提高了50％。三月份，旋床工段里没有一个工人完成的日计划的百分比低于120％。在庆祝“五一”的社会主义竞赛中，旋床工段平均完成了计划的161％，铣床工段——148％，钳工工段——174％等等。我个人一班内所完成的工作经常是定额的240％到250％。
    还在今年年初，我在我们的车间里就把生产工序作了恰当的分配：每一个加工过程都是由熟练的和相应等级的工人来进行的。结果，我们消除了从前那种把一般的活也交给高度熟练的工人去做的现象，减低了产品的价格。我和我的同志鲍格丹·潘契夫提出了一个车制主要传动装置的一种零件的新方法。我们的合理化建议已经采用到生产中。由于采用了我们的合理化建议，不仅提高了劳动生产率，而且也大大地改善了被车制的零件的质量。
    经常参加社会主义竞赛，为争取最大的劳动胜利而斗争，我们配件制造工厂的工人，就是这样地来迎接我们最伟大的节日——全世界劳动人民国际团结节日。
