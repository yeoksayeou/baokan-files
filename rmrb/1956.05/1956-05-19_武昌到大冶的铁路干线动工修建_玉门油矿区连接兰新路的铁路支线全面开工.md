Construction has begun on the Wuchang-Daye railway trunk line, with work underway on roadbeds, bridges, and stations at nine locations.

This railway is being built to support the construction and production of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex. In the future, it will be used to transport equipment and materials for the construction of the Daye Iron Mine to the Tieshan mining area, and to transport ore from the Daye Iron Mine to the iron smelting area of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex.

This railway will also be connected to the urban railway of Huangshi City, serving the production and construction of this emerging industrial city.

The Wuchang-Daye railway line mostly traverses hills, lakes, and depressions. Three routes were compared during the survey, and a more economically reasonable route was finally selected. (Xinhua News Agency)

The railway branch line running from the Yumen Oil Field to the Lanxin Railway trunk line has fully started construction. Road construction workers scattered along this construction line are overcoming the difficulties caused by wind, sand, and water shortage, and are stepping up the construction of roadbeds, bridges, culverts, and stations.

The Yumen Oil Field is located on the edge of the Qilian Mountains and is at a higher altitude, so the Lanxin Railway trunk line cannot directly pass through the mining area. After this railway branch line is completed, crude oil produced by the Yumen Oil Field can be directly loaded onto trains from the mining area for transportation. (Xinhua News Agency)

    武昌到大冶的铁路干线动工修建
    玉门油矿区连接兰新路的铁路支线全面开工
    修建中的武昌到大冶的铁路干线，目前有九处路基、桥梁和车站进行施工。
    这条铁路是为支援武汉钢铁联合企业的建设和生产而兴建的。将来，要通过它把建设大冶铁矿的设备、材料运到铁山矿区，把大冶铁矿的矿石运到武汉钢铁联合企业的炼铁区。
    这条铁路还将和黄石市的市区铁路连接起来，为这座新兴工业城市的生产建设服务。
    武昌到大冶的铁路沿线，多是丘陵、湖沼和洼地，勘测时曾经选择三条路线进行比较，最后选定了一条比较经济合理的线路。　（新华社）
    从玉门油矿区修到兰新铁路干线上的铁路支线全面开工。散布在这条施工线路上的筑路工人，正在克服着风砂和缺水所造成的困难，加紧修筑路基、桥涵和车站。
    玉门油矿在祁连山的边上，地势较高，兰新铁路干线不能直接从矿区经过。这条铁路支线修通以后，玉门油矿出产的原油就可以直接从矿区装上火车外运。　　　（新华社）
