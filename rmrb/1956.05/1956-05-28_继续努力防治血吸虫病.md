    Continue Efforts to Prevent and Control Schistosomiasis

    The prevention and control of schistosomiasis has already formed a large-scale mass movement in many epidemic areas. According to incomplete statistics from nine provinces, including Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang, the area of land used for burying snails had reached over 270 million square meters by the end of March this year; more than 50,000 patients were treated, equivalent to half the total number treated from 1951 to 1955. Fecal management systems have also been established in many places. In Jiangsu Province alone, 1,366 townships have implemented such systems. Scientific research on the treatment of schistosomiasis has also made considerable progress, with initial achievements in experimental research on shortening the antimony agent treatment process and reducing its toxic side effects. In particular, the collection of experience in traditional Chinese medicine for treating schistosomiasis has been even more remarkable. According to incomplete statistics, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners have contributed more than 400 prescriptions, of which more than 20 have significant effects on eliminating ascites in patients, reducing hepatosplenomegaly, and restoring patients' labor capacity. These achievements have greatly enhanced the masses' confidence in eliminating schistosomiasis.

    The current problem is that some local leading cadres only see the favorable conditions for eliminating schistosomiasis and have developed a sense of complacency, regarding the prevention and control work as an easy task. As a result, preparations have been inadequate, prevention and control teams have not been well-organized, and publicity and education work has not been thorough before the work was easily rolled out. Some local leading cadres underestimate the importance of technical guidance, unilaterally believing that there are no great technical problems in eliminating schistosomiasis, and the problem will be solved as long as the masses are mobilized. As a result, in those areas, preventive measures are not up to standard, and treatment work is not strict enough. In addition, due to insufficient understanding of the situation, the plans for eliminating schistosomiasis in a few areas are not realistic. Some areas even plan to completely eliminate schistosomiasis within three months, which is obviously impossible.

    Eliminating schistosomiasis is a long-term and arduous struggle. The epidemic factors of schistosomiasis are complex, and it is closely related to the natural environment and the inherent production and living habits of residents. To completely eliminate schistosomiasis, it is necessary to change the natural and social factors that promote the epidemic of this disease, and changing these factors cannot be achieved by short-term and simple work. For example, whether using soil burial or chemical methods to kill snails, each time only achieves about 80% effectiveness, and snails must be killed repeatedly to completely eliminate them. Fecal management is also not easy to do thoroughly at once. Especially for the management of livestock manure, various places still lack good experience, and there are more difficulties. In terms of treatment, how to improve the cure rate and shorten the treatment process are still problems that need to be solved well. Therefore, there are still considerable difficulties in completing the treatment tasks stipulated in the plan, and there is an urgent need to discover new treatment drugs and improve existing treatment methods. Overall, our struggle against schistosomiasis only started after liberation, and we still lack sufficient experience, and the cadre force is also insufficient. These are all unfavorable conditions that need to be overcome by our efforts.

    Based on the current situation, it is necessary to continue to strengthen publicity and education to the masses. In particular, attention should be paid to making the masses understand the significance and operating methods of each preventive measure for eliminating schistosomiasis, so as to ensure the standard specifications of each preventive measure and consolidate the achievements of the existing prevention and control work. At the same time, it is necessary to vigorously train health workers in agricultural production cooperatives and activists who are enthusiastic about prevention and control work, so that they are familiar with and accurately grasp the technology related to the prevention and control of schistosomiasis.

    Organizing a strong prevention and control team and strengthening scientific and technical guidance are also important tasks at present. In areas where schistosomiasis is prevalent, specialized prevention and control institutions at all levels should be established and improved as soon as possible in a planned way, and health personnel with higher technical levels should be transferred to work in specialized prevention and control institutions, so that the prevention and control institutions truly become the technical guidance core of the local prevention and control work. Moreover, experts and experienced senior technicians should be organized to go deep into the field frequently to strengthen technical guidance. In terms of treatment, sufficient forces should be organized. In addition to specialized prevention and control institutions undertaking treatment tasks, other medical institutions in epidemic areas should also admit schistosomiasis patients, or form treatment teams to go deep into the countryside for mobile treatment. At the same time, the medical forces in cities and non-epidemic areas should be organized to support the epidemic areas. In particular, attention should be paid to organizing the vast number of traditional Chinese and Western medical personnel distributed in rural areas to participate in prevention and control work in order to expand the prevention and control force. The medical personnel responsible for treatment should be given necessary training to reach a certain technical level. The phenomenon of lowering technical standards simply to pursue treatment numbers must be corrected. In order to strengthen technical guidance for treatment work, a core group responsible for technical guidance can be equipped among several treatment groups in a region to conduct mobile technical training frequently and be responsible for solving difficult problems.

    The production tasks in schistosomiasis-endemic areas are very heavy, and the prevention and control of schistosomiasis is also very arduous. In order to not hinder production and to carry out prevention and control work, it is necessary to incorporate prevention and control work into the production plan, combine it with production, and arrange it uniformly. Experience has shown that as long as the arrangements are appropriate, prevention and control work will not only not affect production, but will also be conducive to production. For example, the implementation of fecal management can not only eliminate parasite eggs, but also increase fertilizer quantity and fertilizer efficiency; removing sod for compost can not only kill snails, but also open up fertilizer sources. Treatment work can also be combined with production. For example, agricultural production cooperatives can sign contracts with treatment units, and the cooperatives can appropriately arrange patients in batches and phases for treatment according to production conditions.

    It is currently the busy farming season, and schistosomiasis-endemic areas should appropriately arrange the prevention and control of schistosomiasis according to local conditions, consolidate the achievements already made, and further advance prevention and control work.

### 继续努力防治血吸虫病

    继续努力防治血吸虫病
    血吸虫病的防治工作，目前已经在许多流行地区形成大规模的群众性运动。据江苏、安徽、浙江等九个省的不完全统计，到今年三月底止，土埋钉螺的面积已经达到二亿七千多万平方公尺；治疗病人五万多名，等于1951年到1955年治疗总数的一半。粪便管理制度也在许多地方建立起来，仅江苏省就有1，366个乡实行了这种制度。治疗血吸虫病的科学研究工作，也有相当进展，对缩短锑剂治疗过程和减低其毒性反应的实验研究等方面已经有了初步成绩。尤其在收集中医中药治疗血吸虫病的经验方面，成绩更为显著。据不完全统计，中医贡献出来的药方已经有四百多种，其中对消除病人腹水，减轻肝脾肿大，恢复病人劳动力有显著效果的就有二十多种。这些成绩，大大地提高了群众消灭血吸虫病的信心。
    目前的问题是，有些地区的领导干部，只看到消灭血吸虫病的有利条件，产生了麻痹思想，把防治工作看成轻而易举的事情。以致准备工作不够充分，防治队伍没有很好地组成，宣传教育工作不深入，就轻易地把工作铺开了。有些地区的领导干部，对技术指导的重要性则估计不足，片面地认为消灭血吸虫病没有了不起的技术问题，只要把群众发动起来，问题就解决了。结果，在那些地区，预防措施不合规格，治疗工作不够严密。此外，由于对情况了解不够，少数地区消灭血吸虫病的规划不切合实际，甚至有的地区计划要在三个月内彻底消灭血吸虫病，这显然是不可能的。
    消灭血吸虫病是一个长期的艰巨的斗争。血吸虫病的流行因素是复杂的，它同自然环境、居民固有的生产和生活习惯有密切联系。要彻底消灭血吸虫病，就必须改变促成这种疾病流行的自然因素和社会因素，而要改变这些因素，就不是靠短时期的简单的工作就能够实现的了。例如，消灭钉螺，不论用土埋的方法，或是用化学药品杀灭的方法，一次都只有80％左右的效果，必须反复多次地扑杀，才能彻底消灭钉螺。粪便管理也不容易一下子做得彻底，尤其对家畜的粪便管理，各地都还缺乏很好的经验，困难也就更多。在治疗方面，如何提高治愈率，缩短治疗过程，都还是需要好好解决的问题。所以完成计划规定的治疗任务还有相当多的困难，迫切需要发现新的治疗药物，改进已有的治疗方法。整个说来，我们同血吸虫病进行斗争，是从解放后才开始的，还缺乏足够的经验，干部力量也不足。这些都是不利条件，有待我们努力去克服。
    根据目前的情况，须要继续加强对群众的宣传教育。特别要注意使群众了解每项预防措施对消灭血吸虫病的意义和操作方法，以保证各项预防措施的标准规格，巩固已有的防治工作的成果。同时要大量培养农业生产合作社的保健员和热心做防治工作的积极分子，使他们熟悉和准确地掌握有关防治血吸虫病的技术。
    组织坚强的防治队伍，加强科学技术指导，也是目前的一项重要工作。在血吸虫病流行的地区，应当有计划地尽快建立和健全各级专业防治机构，调配具有较高技术水平的卫生人员到专业防治机构中去工作，使防治机构真正成为当地防治工作的技术指导核心。并且要经常组织专家和有经验的高级技术人员深入现场，加强技术指导。在治疗方面，要组织足够的力量，除了专业防治机构应当担任治疗任务以外，流行地区的其他医疗机构也应当收治血吸虫病人，或组成治疗小组，深入农村巡回治疗。同时要组织城市和非病区的医务力量，支援病区。特别应当重视组织分布在农村中的广大中西医务人员参加防治工作，以扩大防治力量。对负责治疗的医务人员，要加以必要的训练，使他们达到一定的技术水平。那种只是为了追求治疗数字而降低技术标准的现象必须纠正。为了加强治疗工作的技术指导，可以在一个地区的若干治疗组中间，配备一个负责技术指导的核心组，经常进行巡回技术辅导，负责解决疑难问题。
    血吸虫病流行地区的生产任务十分繁重，血吸虫病的防治工作也十分艰巨。为了既不妨碍生产，又能开展防治工作，必须把防治工作纳入生产规划，结合生产，统一布置。经验证明，只要安排得当，防治工作不仅不会影响生产，而且会有利于生产。例如实行粪便管理，既可以消灭虫卵，又可以增加肥量肥效；铲草皮堆肥，既能灭螺，又可以开辟肥源。治疗工作也可以结合生产进行，例如采取农业生产合作社同治疗单位订立合同的方式，由社内根据生产情况将病人适当排队，分批分期进行治疗。
    目前正是农忙季节，血吸虫病流行地区应该根据当地情况，把血吸虫病的防治工作适当安排一下，巩固已经取得的成绩，并且把防治工作推进一步。
