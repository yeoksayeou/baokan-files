To the Editor:

The quality of repairs at the Local State-Owned Harbin Automobile Repair Factory is terrible. Many vehicles have been returned to this factory for rework several times, but they still leave the factory with "illnesses." For example, a hospital ambulance from the Hegang Mining Bureau was sent to this factory for repair, and although it was reworked more than ten times, the wheel speed was still inconsistent. In 1955, this repair factory overhauled and medium-repaired a total of 125 vehicles, but in the five months from July to December, eighty vehicles were reworked 149 times. This situation has made the units entrusting repairs very dissatisfied, and some people have said: "I will never come here for repairs again!"

However, the leaders of this factory dare not face up to the shortcomings in their work. They said: "It is inevitable that the quality of automobile repairs will be poor due to the new factory, incomplete personnel, and unsound organization." They have also adopted a long-term erroneous attitude of ignoring some positive opinions put forward by the workers.

### 再也不到这里来修车了

    再也不到这里来修车了编辑同志：
    地方国营哈尔滨汽车修配厂修车质量很糟。有不少车在这个厂里经过几次返工修理，但结果还是带“病”出厂。例如，鹤岗矿务局病院有一辆救护车送到这个厂来修理，虽然经过十几次返工，但是轮速仍然不一致。1955年，这个修配厂大修和中修的车辆共125台，但在七月到十二月的五个月里，就有八十台车返工149次。这种情况已经使委托修车的单位很不满意，有人就说：“以后再也不到这里来修车了！”
    但是，这个厂的领导人对于自己工作中的缺点还不敢正视。他们说：“新建厂，人员不齐，机构不健全，汽车修配质量不好是难免的。”有些工人群众提出一些积极性的意见，他们也长期采取了置之不理的错误态度。
