Jiangsu is carrying out the second round of cooperative rectification work.

The second round of cooperative rectification work in Jiangsu Province has been fully launched and is expected to be completed by mid-May. The content of this rectification is centered around spring plowing and production, with the implementation of diligence and thrift in running cooperatives as the core, and the formulation of labor and financial plans. So far, about 75% of the cooperatives in the province have formulated short-term plans centered on spring sowing and have implemented labor operation tables.

The agricultural production cooperatives in various places, after the second round of rectification, have basically implemented the policy of "diligence and thrift in running cooperatives." All cooperatives have improved labor utilization through labor planning, achieving "everyone has something to do, and everything has someone to do." After the financial planning of the cooperatives, non-productive expenditures have been reduced, extravagance and waste have been corrected and stopped, and the rational use of funds has been ensured. Hengtang No. 1 Cooperative in Danyang County originally planned to build warehouses, pigsties, and buy large trucks, seeders, etc. After queuing and calculating, ten capital construction projects that could be postponed were reduced, and the funds originally required were reduced from 80,000 yuan to 20,000 yuan.

　　江苏开展第二遍整社工作
    江苏省第二遍整社工作已经全面展开，预计在五月中旬可以结束。这次整社的内容，是围绕春耕生产，以贯彻执行勤俭办社为中心，制定劳动和财务规划。到目前为止，全省已经有75％左右的社制定了以春播为中心的小段计划，推行了劳动作业表。
    各地经过第二遍整顿的农业生产合作社，基本上贯彻执行了“勤俭办社”的方针。各社都通过劳动规划，提高了劳动利用率，做到“人人有事做，事事有人做”。各社经过财务规划以后，都削减了非生产性开支，纠正并且制止了铺张浪费，保证了资金的合理使用。丹阳县横塘一社原计划要造仓库、猪圈，买大卡车、播种机等，通过排队算账，削减了十项可暂缓举办的基本建设，把原来需用的资金从八万元减到二万元。
