Bamboo Reinforcement Can Replace Steel Reinforcement in Civil Buildings

On the 10th, the "Bamboo Utilization Exhibition" held by the Building Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Construction Engineering displayed physical models of bamboo-reinforced concrete slabs made of bamboo instead of steel.

This exhibition tells people that China is rich in bamboo, with an annual output of about 4 million tons. If one-tenth of these bamboos are used, they can replace 500,000 cubic meters of wood. The use of bamboo-reinforced concrete in civil buildings can save 50% of steel compared to the present.

Chinese construction scientists have proven that bamboo can be used as a major building material. Bamboo can have waterproof, anti-corrosion, and durable properties after chemical treatment. The exhibition here shows methods of waterproofing bamboo reinforcement with paint coatings and methods of injecting preservatives such as zinc chloride into bamboo poles under pressure.

Three large glued-laminated timber trusses are also specially exhibited in the outdoor open space. One is a 14-meter span, one is an 18-meter span, both of which can be used for building factories, warehouses, auditoriums, etc. The other is a 24-meter span, which can be used for larger textile factories and other buildings. Its cost is only 600 yuan, and such a large span cannot be achieved by ordinary wood structures.

    民用建筑可用竹筋代替钢筋
    十日，建筑工程部建筑科学研究院举办的“竹材利用展览”上，展出了用竹材代替钢材做成的竹筋混凝土楼板的实体模型。
    这个展览告诉人们，我国盛产竹材，年产约四百万吨。若利用这些竹材的十分之一，就可以代替五十万立方公尺木材。在民用建筑中使用竹筋混凝土，可以比现在节约50％钢材。
    我国建筑科学工作者研究证明，竹材可以作为主要的建筑材料。竹材经过化学处理，可以具有防水、防腐、耐久等性能。这里展览着对竹筋用油漆涂料防水的方法，对竹杆加压注入氯化锌等防腐剂的方法。
    这里的室外空地上还特别展览着三座大型的胶合木屋架，一座是十四公尺跨度的，一座是十八公尺跨度的，都可以供建筑工厂、仓库、大礼堂等使用；另一座是二十四公尺跨度的，可以供更大型的纺织工厂等建筑使用，它的造价仅六百元，并且这样大的跨度是普通木结构达不到的。
