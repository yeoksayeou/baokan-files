Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 27th. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region held a banquet in the Lhasa Auditorium today to bid farewell to the General Delegation and the First and Third Sub-Delegations of the Central Delegation.

The Dalai Lama, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, spoke at the banquet. He said: We have been living closely together for over a month now. During this very precious period, we have always been united, friendly, helping and learning from each other. More importantly, we have jointly accomplished many major tasks that are beneficial to the unity of the motherland, the unity within Tibet, progress, and development. We have successfully completed the work of establishing the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, which has opened up broad avenues for our future work and powerfully shattered the rumors and provocations of imperialist secret agents. The Dalai Lama expressed his deep reluctance at the impending departure of the Central Delegation from Lhasa and hoped that the delegation would convey to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao, and the people of all ethnic groups across the country that the Tibetan brothers and sisters in the remote southwestern border region of the motherland are working tirelessly to transition to a prosperous and happy socialist society together with the people of all ethnic groups.

Chen Yi, head of the Central Delegation and Vice Premier of the State Council, also spoke at the banquet. He said: "After the founding of New China, the imperialists hoped that there would be disunity among the fraternal ethnic groups of our country, especially by constantly provoking discord between the Han and Tibetan ethnic groups, attempting to alienate the central government from Tibet, and trying to prevent the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. But all the plans of the imperialists have failed, and the unity of the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland has achieved a great victory." Chen Yi analyzed that the reason for this more consolidated unity is due to the correctness of the ethnic equality policy, religious freedom policy, and peaceful social reform policy of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao; at the same time, it is also due to the efforts of the Tibetan people's leaders, the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni, as well as all Tibetan monks, officials, and people. Chen Yi said that with such a united and strong Tibet, our motherland will be even stronger and more glorious. Chen Yi concluded by saying that he believes this separation is temporary, and we will forever be united in the common cause of building the motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 27th. The Dalai Lama hosted the General Delegation of the Central Delegation with exquisite Tibetan cuisine at his summer palace, Norbulingka, at 5 pm yesterday. By the 26th, the General Delegation of the Central Delegation had concluded its visit here and was about to leave Tibet.

The Dalai Lama spoke at the banquet. He first expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Central Delegation for the instructions and assistance they had given during their visit to Tibet. He said, "We have become old friends with all the comrades of the Central Delegation, and we hope that the comrades of the Central Delegation will write to us often. The Beijing-Lhasa air route has been successfully test-flown, and our planes will soon be in operation, making transportation more convenient in the future. I believe everyone will come to Tibet again."

Chen Yi, head of the Central Delegation, also spoke at the banquet. He said that after arriving in Tibet and seeing such good leaders, officials, and people, as well as such a good place, our understanding and feelings for Tibet have increased even more. Chen Yi said that we are united in respecting freedom of religious belief, safeguarding the great family of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups, and building the motherland and Tibet even better, which has increased our feelings. The establishment conference of the Tibet Autonomous Region Preparatory Committee reached a unanimous opinion on the issue of reform, which has also greatly increased our unity and feelings.

Chen Yi also said that when the Central Delegation was in Tibet, contacting leaders, officials, and the broad masses of the people, we exchanged opinions, talked about strengths, and also talked about shortcomings. Therefore, our unity is sincere, which has also increased our feelings even more.

Before attending the banquet, the members of the Central Delegation toured Norbulingka. This green garden and beautiful Lhasa will leave a deep impression on the members of the Central Delegation.

    各族人民在建设祖国的共同事业中永远团结在一起
    西藏自治区筹委会和达赖分别设宴送别中央代表团
    新华社拉萨27日电　西藏自治区筹备委员会今天在拉萨大礼堂举行宴会，欢送中央代表团总团和第一、第三分团。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会主任达赖喇嘛在宴会上讲话。他说：我们亲密相处已经一个多月了。在这十分难得的一段时间里，我们始终是团结、友爱、互相帮助和互相学习的，更重要的是我们共同完成了许多有利于祖国的统一、团结和有利于西藏内部的统一、团结进步和发展的重大事情，胜利地完成了成立西藏自治区筹备委员会的工作，为我们今后的工作开辟了广阔的道路，也有力地粉碎了帝国主义特务分子的造谣挑拨。达赖喇嘛对中央代表团即将离开拉萨，表示了十分留恋的心情，并希望代表团转告中共中央、毛主席和全国各族人民，远处祖国西南边陲的藏族兄弟，正在为了能够和各族人民一起过渡到繁荣幸福的社会主义社会而不懈地努力。
    中央代表团团长、国务院副总理陈毅也在宴会上讲了话。他说：“新中国成立后，帝国主义希望我国各兄弟民族间不团结，特别是不断在汉、藏民族间进行挑拨，想离间中央和西藏的关系，想使西藏自治区筹备委员会成立不起来。但是帝国主义的一切打算都失败了，祖国各族人民的团结得到了伟大的胜利。”陈毅分析这种团结更加巩固的原因，是由于中国共产党、毛主席的民族平等政策、宗教信仰自由政策和和平的社会改革政策的正确；同时，由于西藏人民的领袖达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼以及全体西藏僧俗官员和人民的努力。陈毅说，我们有这样一个团结、强盛的西藏，我们祖国会更强大和更光荣。陈毅最后说，我相信这次的分离是暂时的，我们将在建设祖国的共同事业中永远地团结在一起。
    新华社拉萨27日电　达赖喇嘛昨天下午五时在他的夏宫——罗布林卡，以精美的西藏饭菜招待中央代表团总团。到二十六日为止，中央代表团总团结束了在此间的访问，就要离开西藏。
    达赖喇嘛在宴会上讲了话。他首先对中央代表团这次来到西藏对他们所作的指示和帮助表示衷心的感谢。他说：“我们已经同中央代表团全体同志成了老朋友了，希望中央代表团同志经常来信。北京—拉萨航空线已经试航成功，我们的飞机就要通航，以后交通更方便了，相信大家还会再到西藏来。”
    中央代表团团长陈毅也在宴会上讲了话。他说，我们到了西藏，看到这样好的领袖、官员和人民以及这样好的地方，更增加了我们对西藏的认识和感情。陈毅说，我们在尊重宗教信仰自由、维护祖国大家庭和各民族的团结以及把祖国和西藏建设得更好方面是一致的，这就增加了我们的感情。这次西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会对改革问题取得了一致的意见，这也大大增加了我们的团结和感情。
    陈毅又说，中央代表团在西藏同领袖、官员以及广大人民接触的时候，是互相提意见、讲长处，也讲缺点。因此，我们的团结是真诚的，这也更增加了我们的感情。
    中央代表团人员在出席宴会前，游览了罗布林卡。这个绿色的花园以及美丽的拉萨，将留给中央代表团人员以深刻的印象。
