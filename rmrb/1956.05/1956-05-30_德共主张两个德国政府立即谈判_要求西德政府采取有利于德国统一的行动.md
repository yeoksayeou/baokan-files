Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, May 28th: According to TASS, the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party issued a statement advocating that the West German government take action to seek the reunification of Germany.

The statement said that the Adenauer government's policies hinder the restoration of German unity. Restoring unity is first and foremost a matter for the Germans themselves. Anyone who wants to restore unity should support negotiations between the two German governments and the two German parliaments.

The statement said: The Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic can and should immediately begin negotiations on the following issues: the issue of not implementing universal conscription in both parts of Germany; the issue of not having atomic weapons on German soil; the issue of limiting armaments and the number of military personnel; the issue of preventing fascist war incitement and any form of militaristic propaganda, opposing racial persecution, and opposing inciting discord among nations.

The statement pointed out that the German Democratic Republic has continuously put forward proposals for establishing normal relations for several years. Recently, the government of the German Democratic Republic has taken some measures to ease internal tensions in Germany, such as releasing a large number of prisoners convicted in connection with the Cold War waged by Bonn. Now, Bonn should also take steps.

The German Communist Party declares: In order to further ease tensions, the Bundestag should now take the decision to: pardon all prisoners convicted of defending peace and democracy; revoke the more than 10,000 trial cases against people who uphold a policy of peace and strive for pan-German agreements; immediately stop the trial of the German Communist Party; abolish the illegal ban on the activities of various democratic organizations; and fully restore all human rights stipulated in the constitution.

    德共主张两个德国政府立即谈判
    要求西德政府采取有利于德国统一的行动
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社波恩二十八日讯：德国共产党中央委员会书记处发表声明，主张西德政府采取行动，谋求德国的统一。
    声明说，阿登纳政府的政策阻碍了恢复德国统一。恢复统一首先是德国人自己的事情。谁要想恢复统一，谁就应当拥护两个德国政府和两个德国议会谈判。
    声明说：德意志联邦共和国同德意志民主共和国之间能够而且应该立即开始就下列问题进行谈判：关于在德国的两个部分都不实施普遍兵役制的问题；关于在德国的土地上不应该有原子武器的问题；关于限制军备和军队人员的数量问题；关于制止法西斯的战争煽动和任何形式的军国主义的宣传、反对种族迫害、反对唆使各民族互相不和的问题。
    声明指出，德意志民主共和国几年来曾经不断提出建立正常关系的建议，最近，德意志民主共和国政府又采取了一些有利于和缓德国内部紧张局势的措施，譬如，释放了大量同波恩进行的冷战有关系而被判罪的囚犯。现在，波恩方面也应该采取步骤。
    德国共产党声明：为了进一步和缓紧张局势，联邦议院现在就应该采取决定：赦免一切由于保卫和平、民主而被判罪的犯人；撤销对维护和平政策及争取全德协议的人所进行的一万多件审判案；立即停止对德国共产党的审判；取消对各民主组织的活动的非法禁令；完全恢复宪法所规定的各项人权。
