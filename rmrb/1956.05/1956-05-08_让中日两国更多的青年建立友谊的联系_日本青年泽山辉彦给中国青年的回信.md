Let More Young People from China and Japan Establish Friendly Ties
Reply from Japanese Youth Teruhiko Sawayama to Chinese Youth

To the People's Daily:

　　Some time ago, I sent you a letter asking you to help me find Chinese friends. I am grateful that you published this letter in your newspaper on February 5th. Many, many young Chinese people wrote to me and sent stamps. My mother and sister and I were extremely happy when we saw these letters!

　　As of March 14th, I had received one hundred and twenty letters from your country. Each letter was filled with the desire to establish normal relations between China and Japan as soon as possible, to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs, to build a peaceful world, and with the determination to build the motherland, and they all expressed the wish to become friends with the Japanese people.

　　However, if I were to reply to all these letters now, it would take me until the end of the year. People who receive my letters late might think that I am not even writing back. So I am writing this letter first. I want to tell them that there are many people in Japan now who want to correspond with or exchange stamps with friends in your country. It is better for many people to communicate than for me alone to communicate with more than a hundred people, as it can deepen the mutual understanding and friendship between the people of the two countries and make a greater contribution to the cause of peace. However, if I introduce a letter from a friend in your country to someone else, I will at least inform the friend who wrote the letter by postcard.

　　I am very happy now. The deep friendship that friends in your country have given me will be an unforgettable memory in my life. Let this be a bridge of beautiful friendship between the people of Japan and China!

　　I wish my Chinese friends good health!

　　让中日两国更多的青年建立友谊的联系
    日本青年泽山辉彦给中国青年的回信
　　人民日报社：
    前些时候，我寄给你们一封信，请你们代为征求中国朋友。这封信，承你们在二月五日的报上发表了。很多很多的中国青年给我写来了信，并且寄来了邮票。我和母亲、姐姐在看到这些邮件的时候，都极其高兴！
    到三月十四日为止，从贵国寄来的信，已经有一百二十封了。每封信中，都充满了早日建立中日正常关系、禁止原子弹和氢弹、建设和平世界的愿望和建设祖国的决心，并且都表示想和日本人民成为朋友。
    可是，现在如果我和这些来信的人都写回信的话，就要一直写到今年底。这样，迟收到我的信的人，也许会以为我连回信都不写了。因此我先写了这封信。我想告诉他们：现在日本有许多人想和贵国的朋友们通信或者交换邮票。我一个人和一百多人通信，不如很多的人来通信更能加深两国人民的相互了解和友谊，并对和平事业有更大的贡献。但是，我假如把贵国某个朋友来的信介绍给别人的时候，我至少也要用明信片告诉来信的朋友。
    我现在心情非常愉快，贵国朋友们给予我的深厚的友情，将成为我一生难忘的记忆存留在我的心上。让这成为日中两国人民间的美好友谊的桥梁吧！
    祝贺中国朋友们健康！
