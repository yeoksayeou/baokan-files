    Another Exploratory Well in the Karamay Oilfield Area Strikes Oil
    In the Karamay Oilfield Area of the Xinjiang Petroleum Company, another exploratory well gushed crude oil at 8:30 PM on April 23rd.
    This exploratory well is the second well completed in Karamay. This well is an important edge well for exploring the oil storage structure of Karamay. The oil production from this edge well has expanded the originally estimated oil storage area.
    After the first exploratory well in the Karamay Oilfield Area gushed crude oil last year, the oil and gas conditions of several oil layers have been very good during several months of oil testing.

    黑油山探区又一探井出油
    新疆石油公司黑油山探区，又有一口探井在四月二十三日下午八时三十分喷出原油。
    这口探井是黑油山已经完钻的第二口探井。这口探井是勘探黑油山一个储油构造情况的很重要的边探井。这个边探井的出油，扩大了原来预计的储油面积。
    黑油山探区第一口探井去年喷出原油以后，在几个月的试油当中，几个油层的油、气情况都很良好。
