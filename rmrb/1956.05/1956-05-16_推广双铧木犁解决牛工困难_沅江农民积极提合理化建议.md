Promoting Double-Share Wooden Plows to Solve Cattle Labor Difficulties
　　Yuanjiang Farmers Actively Offer Rationalization Proposals
    Farmers in Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province, are launching a wave of rationalization proposals. By early May, farmers throughout the county had submitted more than 1,100 rationalization proposals, of which 15 have played a significant role in promoting current agricultural production. The double-share wooden plow created by agricultural cooperative members Liu Mingfeng, Long Shaowen, and Li Shaoxi has a light plow body and can be pulled by one ox. It plows paddy fields twice as efficiently as old plows. This improved farm tool has been rapidly promoted throughout the county, solving the difficulty of lacking cattle labor. The methods of using clear water to prevent seedling rot in rice paddies, using a mixture of Croton tiglium dregs to eliminate paddy field pests, and using rice straw raincoats instead of palm-made raincoats, all created by members of agricultural cooperatives, have been widely promoted in spring plowing. Currently, many people are continuing to research inventions such as hemp stripping machines, fertilizer applicators, new-style waterwheels, and cultivators, striving to put them into production quickly.

    推广双铧木犁解决牛工困难
    沅江农民积极提合理化建议
    湖南省沅江县的农民正在掀起一个提合理化建议的热潮，到五月上旬，全县农民提出的合理化建议共有一千一百多件，其中有十五件对推动当前的农业生产起了重大作用。农业生产合作社的社员刘明凤、龙绍雯、李少希创造的双铧木犁，犁身轻，一头牛就可拉动，耕水田的效率比旧犁提高一倍，这件改良农具，迅速在全县推广，解决了缺乏牛工的困难。由农业社的社员们创造的用秧田漂清水办法防止烂秧、用巴豆茶枯合剂消灭秧田虫害，用稻草编蓑衣代替棕制的蓑衣都在春耕中普遍推广，现在还有不少的人在继续研究剥麻机、点肥机、新式水车和中耕器等发明创造，争取很快地投入生产。
