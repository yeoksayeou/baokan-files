Italian Local Elections

Italy is scheduled to hold local elections on May 27th and 28th to elect new local autonomous bodies in 79 provinces and 7,141 municipalities.

According to the law, Italian local elections are held every four years. The last local election should have been held in 1951. However, because the Italian ruling group played tricks in the election at that time, it actually divided the election into two parts (the north in 1951 and the south in 1952) so that the Christian Democratic Party could form electoral alliances with right-wing parties in southern Italy and with so-called middle parties in northern Italy, and rely on the reactionary election law to seize more seats in local councils. In that election, the Christian Democratic Party lost a large number of votes compared to the past, while the votes obtained by progressive forces such as the Communist Party and the Socialist Party greatly increased compared to the past. However, the Christian Democratic Party used the above-mentioned election tricks to steal some seats in local councils.

In the local by-elections held at the end of 1953 and the beginning of 1954, the votes obtained by democratic parties increased significantly again, while the votes obtained by the government party alliance decreased again. The results of previous local elections show the continuous growth of the prestige of progressive forces among the people. Democratic parties currently hold an absolute majority of seats in 2,200 municipal councils and 23 provincial councils.

In the 1953 parliamentary elections, progressive forces won the support of nearly 10 million voters, defeating the reactionaries' attempt to use undemocratic election laws to exclude democratic parties and dominate the parliament, achieving a great victory. Since that election, the position of the Italian ruling group has become increasingly shaky, and the government's reactionary policies have been met with increasingly strong opposition from the people. Under the strong pressure of the broad masses of the people demanding a change in the current policies, the ruling Christian Democratic Party has to use two-faced tactics to cover itself. On the one hand, it continues to pursue the Atlantic policy, and on the other hand, it has to express its willingness to follow an independent diplomatic line and promise the people to implement social reforms. These profound changes in the Italian situation reflect the growing will of the people to demand peace, democracy, and progress. This strong will of the Italian people will undoubtedly be expressed more clearly in this local election. The Italian Communist Party has called on all voters to make this local election a nationwide vote for peace.

In March of this year, as a result of the people's strong struggle, the ruling party was forced to abolish the reactionary election law of 1951 and implement a proportional representation system in towns with a population of more than 10,000. This is an important victory for the people.

The current election law is still not completely democratic, and some of its clauses are still conducive to reactionary parties fabricating election results and illegally exerting pressure on voters. However, progressive forces have been actively preparing for this local election, striving to win a left-wing democratic majority in as many provincial councils and municipal councils as possible, in order to promote the "leftward turn" of Italy's national policy.

### 意大利地方选举

    意大利地方选举
    意大利定五月二十七、二十八两天举行地方选举，改选七十九个省和七千一百四十一个市镇的地方自治机构。
    根据法律规定，意大利的地方选举每隔四年举行一次。上一次地方选举本来应该是在1951年举行的。但是因为意大利统治集团当时在选举中玩弄花样，竟把选举分作两次（北部在1951年，南部在1952年）举行，以便天主教民主党可以分别在意大利的南部同右翼党派、在北部同所谓中间党派结成选举联盟，而依靠反动的选举法，夺取地方议会中较多的议席。在那一届选举中，天主教民主党比过去丧失了大量选票，共产党和社会党等进步力量所获得的选票则比过去大为增加，但是天主教民主党却借着上述的选举诡计，窃取了一些地方议会的席位。
    在1953年底和1954年初举行的地方补缺选举中，民主党派获得的选票又大有增加，而政府党派联盟所得选票则再次下降。从历次地方选举的结果中，就可以看出进步力量在人民群众中间威信的不断增长。民主党派目前在二千二百个市政委员会和二十三个省政委员会中占有绝对多数的议席。
    进步力量在1953年的议会选举中获得将近一千万选民的支持，击败了反动派企图利用不民主的选举法，排斥民主党派而独霸议会的阴谋，取得巨大的胜利。自从那次选举以来，意大利统治集团的地位日益动摇，政府的反动政策遭到了人民愈来愈强烈的反对。在广大人民要求改变现行政策的强大压力之下，当权的天主教民主党不能不用两面手法来掩饰自己。它一方面继续奉行大西洋政策，同时另一方面又不得不表示愿意遵循独立的外交路线，以及向人民许诺实行社会改革。意大利局势的这些深刻变化，反映了人民要求和平、民主和进步的意志日益增强。意大利人民的这种强烈意志无疑的将会在这一次地方选举中更明显地表达出来。意大利共产党已号召全体选民，使这一次地方选举成为全民的和平投票。
    今年三月，由于人民强烈斗争的结果，执政党被迫废除了1951年的反动选举法，而在人口一万以上的市镇实行比例代表制。这是人民的一个重要胜利。
    现在实行的选举法也还不是完全民主的，其中有些条款还有利于反动党派捏造选举结果、对选民非法地施加压力等勾当。但是进步力量一直在积极地为这一次地方选举作准备，争取在尽可能多的省政委员会和市政委员会中赢得左翼民主多数，以便促使意大利的国家政策“向左转”。
