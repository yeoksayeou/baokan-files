　　Constantly Oppose Acts of Discrimination Against Poor Peasants
    Gao Changren
　　During the great development of agricultural cooperation in Hunan Province last winter, Party committees at all levels and the vast number of rural workers worked hard to deeply mobilize and rely on poor peasants to establish cooperatives. Most of the more than 90,000 agricultural production cooperatives in the province implemented the Party's class policy in rural areas during the establishment process. However, when entering the spring plowing production period, a few regions forgot the policy of relying on poor peasants to run cooperatives.

　　In Meixian Township, Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, many agricultural cooperatives experienced discrimination against poor peasants. In the Seventh Agricultural Cooperative of this township, the poor peasants paid their full 600 yuan share fund, while the middle peasants, who were supposed to pay 1,500 yuan, only paid 100 yuan. Instead of mobilizing the middle peasant members to pay, the cooperative deducted all of the 120 yuan relief funds that eight poor peasant households received from the government and used it to purchase cattle for the entire cooperative. In the Meixian Agricultural Cooperative, it was easy for middle peasant member Peng Zhuangyu to withdraw money. Once, after earning more than 20 yuan from sideline occupations, he borrowed another 2 yuan from the cooperative. Poor peasant Peng Youren, because of his difficult living conditions, wanted to borrow some money from the cooperative to buy raincoats and straw hats for working in the rain, but he could not borrow it even after several trips. In many cooperatives in this township, the allocation of work often assigned the heavy and rough work to poor peasant members, while the middle peasant members mostly did the high-paying technical work. Discrimination and a lack of concern for poor peasants also existed in Xiangyin County. In Yongfeng Cooperative of Yongping Township in this county, poor peasant member Yu Lasi was unable to pay for rice seeds due to financial difficulties. He was ridiculed by upper-middle peasant members and did not receive support and assistance from the cooperative committee. In the end, he had to tearfully request to withdraw from the cooperative. According to recent statistics, in this county, 132 poor peasant households reluctantly requested to withdraw from the cooperatives because they were unable to receive help and care from the cooperatives due to financial difficulties.

　　Why has the right-leaning thought of excluding poor peasants and not caring about their lives, which was repeatedly criticized last year, reappeared now? The main reason is that some leading organs were intoxicated by the percentage of poor peasants joining the cooperatives, thinking that there were no more problems in implementing the class policy, and relaxed their political leadership over the agricultural cooperatives. In the work deployments of many counties, only the operation and management and technical measures of the cooperatives were discussed, and little was said about political work. When the leading organs relaxed their political leadership, some rural workers gradually blurred their class viewpoints in handling daily work. Judging from the above situation, the problem of relying on poor peasants and establishing the leadership advantage of poor peasants in cooperatives cannot be completely solved through one movement. Therefore, Party organizations in various places should continuously conduct political education and class policy education for members in the daily work of the cooperatives, constantly oppose the right-leaning thought of not caring about the lives of poor peasants and frustrating their enthusiasm for running the cooperatives, and ensure the healthy development of the cooperation movement.

　　不断地反对歧视贫农的行为
    高长任
    湖南省在去年冬季农业合作化大发展的时候，各级党委和广大农村工作人员都曾艰苦深入地发动贫农，依靠贫农办社。全省九万多个农业生产合作社在建社过程中，大部分都贯彻执行了党在农村的阶级政策。但在进入春耕生产的时候，少数地区又把依靠贫农办社的政策忘掉了。
    湖南省平江县梅仙乡许多农业合作社，就发生了歧视贫农的现象。这个乡第七农业合作社，贫农应交的六百元股份基金都交齐了，中农应交的一千五百元股份基金，却只交了一百元。这个社不去动员中农社员交纳，而把八户贫农得到政府的救济款一百二十多元全部扣下来，挪为全社购买耕牛的费用。在梅仙农业合作社里，中农社员彭庄瑜支钱很容易，有一次他刚刚搞副业赚了二十多元，又向社里借了二元。贫农彭有仁因为生活困难，想向社里借点钱买蓑衣斗笠，以便雨天出工，但跑了几次也没有借到。这个乡的许多合作社，社内排工多把粗活重活包给贫农社员做，中农社员尽是做一些报酬高的技术活。歧视和不关心贫农的现象，在湘阴县也是存在的。这个县永平乡永丰社贫农社员余腊四因生活困难，交不出稻种，受到上中农社员的讽刺，也没有得到社委会的支持和帮助，他最后不得不哭着提出退社要求。据最近统计，这个县有132户贫农，因生活困难得不到社里的帮助和照顾而忍痛提出了退社要求。
    为什么去年一再批判的排斥贫农、不关心贫农生活的右倾思想，现在又出现了呢？主要是一些领导机关被贫农入社的百分比陶醉了，以为在执行阶级政策上已经没有问题，放松了对农业合作社的政治领导。在许多县的工作部署中，只谈合作社的经营管理、技术措施，很少谈到政治工作。在领导机关放松政治领导的情况下，一些乡村工作人员在处理日常工作的时候，逐渐模糊了阶级观点。从以上的情况看来，在合作社里依靠贫农、树立贫农的领导优势的问题，不是经过一次运动就可以完全解决的。因此，各地党组织在合作社的日常工作中，应该不断向社员进行政治教育和阶级政策的教育，要不断反对那种不关心贫农生活，挫折贫农办社积极性的右倾思想，保证合作化运动健康地发展。
