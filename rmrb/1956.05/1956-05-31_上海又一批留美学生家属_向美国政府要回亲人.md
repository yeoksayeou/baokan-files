    Another Group of Shanghai Families of Students Studying in the U.S.
    Ask the U.S. Government to Return Their Relatives
    (Our Newspaper's dispatch) Recently, families of students studying in the United States in Shanghai have been continuously registering with the Shanghai Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, requesting the government to negotiate with the U.S. government to allow their relatives to return to the motherland and reunite with their families as soon as possible, and to participate in the socialist construction of the motherland.
    He Baozhen, an elderly woman living at 21, Lane 1006, Huashan Road, said that her eldest son, Wu Gongxian, went to the University of Michigan in the United States in 1948 to study engineering, but has been out of contact since 1950. She said sadly, "I am a widow, and I spent a lot of effort to raise these children. After liberation, my children in China have all joined the workforce and have achieved success in their work, which makes me, as a mother, feel comforted. But whenever I think of my eldest son in the United States, whose whereabouts are still unknown, I feel very sad." She wants the U.S. government to explain her son's whereabouts and let him return to the motherland safely.
    Fang Ce Liu, an 80-year-old man living at 12, Lane 167, Maoming South Road, said in a letter to the Civil Affairs Bureau: "My fifth son, Fang Fuhuan, went to the United States in the spring of 1946 to study water conservancy. After liberation, he wrote that he was preparing to return to China in the autumn of 1951, but not only did he not return, but he has not written since 1952. For the past four years, our whole family has tried every means to find out about him. Last autumn, we learned from returned students that my son and daughter-in-law were forced to stay in the United States. After the Sino-U.S. talks reached an agreement on the issue of civilians returning to their countries, the whole family was excited and looked forward to their return, but until today, it is still disappointing." Old Mr. Fang Ce Liu concluded, "I hope to see my son and daughter-in-law while I am still alive. I request the government to negotiate with the U.S. side so that they can return to China as soon as possible and contribute to the construction of the motherland."
    Xu Jiying, an elderly woman living at 70, Lane 201, Chongqing South Road, said that her son, Wu Zuyao, went to the University of California in the United States at the end of 1947 to study aeronautical engineering and is now working as a teaching assistant at the university. Her son wrote that he has not been able to return to China due to the obstruction of the U.S. government. The old lady questioned, "My husband and I only have this one child, and we are very lonely now. Since the U.S. government talks about humanitarianism every day, why doesn't it let my son come back?"

    上海又一批留美学生家属
    向美国政府要回亲人
    本报讯　最近，上海的留美学生家属不断地有人到上海市民政局登记，请求政府向美国政府交涉，使他们的亲人能早日回到祖国与家人团聚，并且参加祖国的社会主义建设。
    住在华山路一○○六弄21号的何葆真老太太说，她的大儿子吴恭先，1948年到美国密执安大学读工科，但是从1950年起，就音讯全无。她悲痛地说：“我是个寡妇，我花了不少心血才将这群孩子带大。解放后，在国内的儿女都已参加工作，而且工作都有成绩，使我做母亲的也得到安慰。但是每逢想起大儿子在美国至今生死不明，就非常伤心难过。”她要美国政府交代她儿子的下落，并且让他平安地回到祖国。
    茂名南路一六七弄12号的八十岁老先生方策六，在他写给民政局的一封信中说：“我的第五个儿子方福桓，在1946年春赴美国学水利。解放后来信说，他准备在1951年秋回国，但是他不但没有回来，并且自1952年起，就没有来信。四年来，我们全家到处设法打听他的消息。去年秋天，才从归国的留学生处探悉我儿子和儿媳被迫滞留美国。中美会谈关于双方平民回国问题达成协议后，全家都兴奋地盼望他们归来，但是直到今天，还是令人失望。”方策六老先生最后说：“我希望能在我活着的时候见到我儿子和儿媳，我请求政府向美方交涉，使他们能早日回国，为祖国建设事业尽一份力量”。
    住在重庆南路201弄70号的许季瑛老太太说，她儿子吴祖耀，在1947年底到美国加利福尼亚州大学读航空机械，现在留校当助教。她儿子来信说，由于美国政府的阻挠，因此至今不能回国。老太太责问说：“我们老夫妻只有这个孩子，现在非常寂寞，既然美国政府天天讲人道，为什么不让我儿子回来呢？”
