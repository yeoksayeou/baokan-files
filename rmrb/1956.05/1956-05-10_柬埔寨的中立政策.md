Cambodia's Neutral Policy
    By Hu Sen'a, Head of the Economic Delegation of the Kingdom of Cambodia to China

    In order to answer questions about the policies adopted by the Royal Government of Cambodia and Cambodia, I think it would be helpful to first briefly review the recent events in Cambodian national life.

    Not long ago, the Cambodian people were liberated from more than eighty years of foreign rule. They cherish their newly acquired independence and freedom, and they long for peace and harmony among the people of the world.

    Therefore, the Cambodian people did not hesitate to follow the principles laid down at the first Asian-African Conference held in Bandung. Proceeding from this peaceful ideal, Cambodia adopted a neutral policy, which was formulated by the national hero, Prince Sihanouk, the father of Cambodian independence, and fully supported by the Cambodian people. Not long ago, at the Third National Congress of the Cambodian People's Socialist Community held in Phnom Penh on April 21, 1956, the Cambodian people reaffirmed their determination to maintain this course.

    The patriotic Cambodian people, united around their religion, king, and national heroes, fully understand that the policy they have adopted is entirely in the interests of the country, opens the way for rapprochement among the people, and greatly contributes to peace. Recently, the Sino-Cambodian friendship that arose from Prince Sihanouk's visit to Beijing in February also demonstrated this good policy. This friendship has been developed and consolidated through the visit and work of our delegation. The trade agreement and payment agreement signed in Beijing on April 24, 1956, established the initial economic relations between our country and great China. Our increasingly close relationship is developing. I am confident that after these initial stages, other stages will follow.

    Today, as I am about to leave the territory of great China, I am very happy to take this opportunity to express my warm gratitude to the Chinese people and the Chinese authorities for the fraternal and warm hospitality and all the conveniences they have given to the economic delegation of the Kingdom of Cambodia to China. I especially thank the Government of the People's Republic of China for organizing many visits for us, allowing us to see the social, cultural, and economic aspects of China to our satisfaction. I have gained a very good impression from this. I can only praise the policies implemented by the Chinese government for national construction. I am filled with admiration for the Chinese people, who are working wholeheartedly for the rapid development of the country, thereby guaranteeing the happiness and peace of the people.

    To this great friendly people, I extend the fraternal greetings of the Cambodian people. My stay in China has left me with the best of memories.

　　柬埔寨的中立政策
    柬埔寨王国访华经济代表团团长  胡森阿
    为了答复关于柬埔寨王国政府和柬埔寨所采取的政策的问题，我认为首先简短地回溯一下柬埔寨国家生活中最近发生的事件是有好处的。
    不久前，柬埔寨人民从八十多年以来的外国势力统治下解放出来，他们热爱新近获得的独立和自由，他们向往着和平和全世界人民的融洽相处。
    因此，柬埔寨人民没有犹疑地奉行了在万隆举行的第一次亚非会议所规定的原则。从这和平的理想出发，柬埔寨采取了中立政策，这政策是由民族英雄、柬埔寨独立之父西哈努克亲王制定而为柬埔寨人民所全力拥护的。不久前，1956年4月21日在金边举行的柬埔寨人民社会同盟第三次全国代表大会中，柬埔寨人民重申了维护这一路线的决心。
    爱国的柬埔寨人民团结在他的宗教、国王和民族英雄的周围，柬埔寨人民充分了解他所采取的政策完全符合国家的利益，为人民的接近打开道路并且大大有助于和平。最近，由于西哈努克亲王在二月间来北京的访问而产生的中柬友谊，也表现了这一良好的政策。由于我们代表团的访问和工作，这个友谊得到了发展和巩固。1956年4月24日在北京签订的贸易协定和支付协定，建立了我国和伟大中国的初步的经济关系。我们之间日益紧密的关系正在发展着。我确信在这些初步阶段以后，将有其他的阶段接着而来。
    今天，我将离开伟大中国的领土，对于中国人民和中国当局给予柬埔寨王国访华经济代表团兄弟般热烈的款待和一切便利，我很高兴乘此机会向他们致以热烈的谢意。我特别感谢中华人民共和国政府为我们组织了许多参观，使我们满意地看到了中国的社会、文化和经济各方面。我从中得到了很好的印象。我只有赞扬中国政府为了国家建设所执行的政策。我对中国人民充满了钦佩，他们一心一意地为了国家的迅速发展而努力工作，从而保证人民的幸福和和平。
    对这伟大的友邦人民，我致以柬埔寨人民兄弟般的敬礼，我在中国的逗留给我留下了最好的回忆。
