On the long, gray main assembly line, workers installed chassis components such as the rear axle, front axle, and transmission shaft onto the inverted, jet-black car frames. After a short while, the suspended, movable iron hooks flipped the frame right-side up. The workers then installed the steering gear, engine, electrical equipment, gasoline tank, water tank, tires, and cab. Finally, the assembled car was driven off the main assembly line, and after passing inspection, it was sent to install the car body.

Since February of this year, workers in the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant's main assembly workshop have trial-assembled more than 200 cars using complete automobile assemblies and parts supplied by the Soviet Union. In the past, they did not know how to assemble cars on the main assembly line, but now, even with incomplete equipment, they are learning advanced assembly techniques. They want to master the technology in the trial assembly process in order to welcome the day of formally assembling domestically produced cars. Young worker Hou Dianfu reached the designed quota after only twenty days of study. The entire workshop completed the trial assembly plan ten days ahead of schedule in April. The trial-assembled cars have already begun to be used.

    总装配线上试装汽车
    在漫长的灰色的总装配线上，工人们在反放着的墨黑的车架上装上了底盘部分的后桥、前轴和传动轴等总成。一会功夫，悬挂着的能够活动的铁钩就把车架翻了个身。工人们又在上面装好转向器、发动机、电器设备、汽油箱、水箱、轮胎和驾驶室等。最后，装好的汽车，开出总装配线，经过试验合格，就去安装车箱。
    第一汽车制造厂总装配车间职工从今年二月起，利用苏联供给的成套的汽车总成和合件，试装出二百多辆汽车。过去他们都不懂得怎样在总装配线上装出汽车，现在他们在设备没有安装齐全的情况下，学习着先进的装配技术。他们要在试装配的过程中，掌握好技术，来迎接正式装配国产汽车的日子。年轻工人侯殿富只学习了二十多天，就达到了设计的定额。全车间在四月份提前十天完成试装配的计划。试装出的汽车，已经开始使用了。
