    The hall was brightly lit. The Ministry of Culture held a tea party here to celebrate the achievements of the performance.
    Shen Yanbing said at the tea party: The level of the performance programs is very high. It fully demonstrates the artistic talent of the worker comrades. He especially praised the programs created by the workers themselves, saying: You are builders of the motherland's socialist cause, and you also record and eulogize your own cause in the form of art. He hoped that amateur artistic activities would be further developed among the workers, so that their cultural life would be enriched and better inspire the production enthusiasm of the people across the country. Representatives of the workers' amateur actors also spoke at the meeting, expressing their gratitude for the encouragement and help from the leaders and people in the literary and art circles.
    The artists warmly welcomed the guests and had cordial conversations with each other. Hou Baolin, Gao Yuanjun, and other famous ballad singers performed their most wonderful programs. The tea party did not end until late at night when everyone had thoroughly enjoyed themselves.
