    Miners March Towards a Cultural and Technological Upsurge
    Zhang Chao, Director of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau
    With the new upsurge in industrial production, the miners of Jiaozuo Coal Mine have launched an upsurge towards a grand march into science, culture, and technology.
    The cultural and technical studies of Jiaozuo Coal Mine workers began in 1949. Now there are 129 classes and 74 groups in middle school, senior primary school, and junior primary school, with 5,309 students. In 1955, the number of students increased by 321% compared to 1951. Since 1953, according to statistics from three units of the Mining Bureau, 1,667 people have been freed from illiteracy, and 257 graduates of senior primary school have entered middle school. In terms of technical learning, in 1952, Wangfeng Mine and Lifeng Mine trained more than 1,400 grassroots cadres and workers at one time. In 1955, according to statistics from three mines, cadres participating in safety regulations learning accounted for 80% of the total number of cadres, and workers participating in learning accounted for more than 80%. The technical level of workers is constantly improving.
    Although there have been these achievements in the cultural and technical studies of employees in the past few years, there are still many difficulties. Either there are no classrooms, or there are no teachers. Study time is often occupied by meetings and other activities, and even administrative team leaders and workshop directors can order the suspension of cultural classes. The full-time teachers equipped by the trade union are also transferred at will, some are pulled to write reports and fill in forms, and some are pulled to attend meetings to take notes. It is also common not to give teachers time to prepare lessons. Why is this? The main reason is that the leaders do not pay attention to learning, and some even think that production has nothing to do with cultural and technical learning. The secretaries of party organizations at all levels do not care, administrative leaders do not support, and the chairmen of trade unions do not personally take the lead. Some staff members are busy there, but their role is not significant.
    Since last October, under the situation of the national socialist revolution upsurge, not only has a new upsurge appeared in production on the industrial front, but also the workers' demands for learning culture and technology have become more urgent. After repeated study, the Party Committee of the mining area began to realize the importance of doing this work well. They examined the past erroneous understanding and made a resolution: the Party Committee Secretary should personally lead the study, and uniformly arrange the miners' spare time activities, stipulating that without the approval of the Party Committee, it is not allowed to arbitrarily occupy spare time for cultural and technical study. In late December 1955, under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, a more comprehensive cultural and technical learning plan was made. Once the leaders paid attention, problems that could not be solved for several years, such as classrooms and desks, were solved, and even the basic construction units, which had always thought that there was no way to engage in cultural learning, also started it.
    In terms of cultural learning, more than 7,000 illiterate people have gone to school, an increase of 45% compared to the end of 1955. Not only have young and middle-aged activists participated, but even some people who were usually less active and older workers have also actively participated. The miners are in high spirits for learning, and phenomena such as being late, leaving early, being absent from classes, and not handing in homework on time have changed.
    Miners are also very enthusiastic about learning technology. In the past, employees who studied technology accounted for only 76% of the total number of people, but now they account for more than 96%. Take the two amateur secondary technical schools that have already been established as an example, the original plan was to open two classes with 140 people, but now five classes have been opened with 278 students, which is almost twice the original plan. Those who study here include general skilled workers, secretaries of Party organizations, and directors of bureaus. They all insisted on attending four evenings of classes every week, and many people did homework after class and on Sundays. Units that originally planned to postpone the establishment of amateur technical schools due to insufficient strength have also hired teachers and found classrooms to run them themselves. Some have even spontaneously organized mutual teaching and learning groups (or classes). After the Party Central Committee's instructions on the issue of intellectuals were issued, engineering and technical personnel and medical personnel were all making personal plans, demanding to improve their professional and technical level, and many spontaneously organized themselves to study, and their enthusiasm was very high.
    As the upsurge of learning among employees has risen, some people worry that it cannot be consolidated. Facts have proved that it can be completely consolidated. Because the students are in high spirits, normal order has been established, and the quality of teaching is also constantly improving. At present, the key to consolidating the miners' learning enthusiasm and achievements is to continue to improve the quality of teaching to meet the miners' requirements. Now the teachers have paid attention to following the mass line, absorbing students' opinions, and constantly improving their teaching methods. For example, the Wangfeng Mine and Lifeng Mine amateur schools implement a regular class and group leader meeting system, which can promptly understand the miners' opinions on teaching. Other good methods include conducting observation teaching in a planned and organized manner, holding homework exhibitions, and conducting centralized training for full-time teachers and part-time teachers during winter and summer vacations to improve their ideological level and professional level. Comparing and rewarding students who study well and teachers who teach well can make the advanced more advanced and the backward catch up with the advanced.
    Mass operational procedures education is an important kind of technical education. When carrying out this kind of technical education, it is required to do the following four points well: (1) combine procedures education with political education; (2) combine procedures education with planning and technical management; (3) combine procedures education with the lessons of current accidents; (4) combine procedures education with actual technical operations.
    We have formulated a comprehensive plan for cultural and technical learning. Workers, technicians, and engineers will appear in our mines, and the backward situation of culture and technology will be fundamentally changed.

    矿工们向文化技术大进军
    焦作矿务局局长　张超
    焦作煤矿的矿工们，随着工业生产的新高涨，掀起了向科学文化技术大进军的热潮。
    焦作煤矿矿工的文化技术学习，从1949年就开始了。现在共有中学、高小、初小等129个班、74个小组，学员5，309人。1955年学员比1951年增加了321％。1953年以来，据矿务局三个单位统计，扫除文盲1，667人，高小毕业升入中学的有257人。在技术学习方面，1952年王封矿和李封矿一次就训练基层干部、工人1，400多人。1955年据三个矿的统计，参加保安规程学习的干部，占干部总数的80％，参加学习的工人占80％以上。工人技术水平不断提高。
    这几年的职工文化技术学习虽然有这些成绩，但是困难还很多。不是没教室，就是没教员。学习时间常常被开会等活动侵占，甚至行政班长、车间主任都能下令停止文化课。工会配备的专任教员也随便被调动，有的被拉去写报告、填表，有的被拉去开会作记录等。不给教员以备课时间更是常事。为什么这样呢？主要原因是领导方面不重视学习，有的还认为生产跟文化技术学习无关。各级党组织的书记不过问，行政领导干部不支持，工会主席也不亲自出马。一些工作人员在那里忙忙碌碌，作用不大。
    去年十月以来，在全国社会主义革命高潮形势下，在工业战线上不但生产出现了新的高涨，矿工学习文化技术的要求也更加迫切。矿区党委会经过反复研究，开始认识到必须把这一工作做好的重要性。检查了过去的错误认识，作出决议：要党委书记亲自领导学习，并且统一安排矿工的业余活动时间，规定不经党委批准，不准随便侵占业余文化技术学习时间。1955年12月下旬，在党委统一领导下，作出了较全面的文化技术学习规划。领导一重视，好几年不能解决的问题如教室棹子等，都解决了，过去一直认为没有办法搞文化学习的基本建设单位也搞起来了。
    在文化学习方面，七千多个文盲都上学了，比1955年底增加了45％。不仅是青壮年积极分子参加了，连一些平时比较不积极的人，老年的工人也都积极参加了。矿工们学习情绪很饱满，以往那种迟到早退和旷课、不按时交作业等现象都改变了。
    矿工们学习技术也很踊跃。过去学习技术的职工只占总人数的76％，现在占96％以上。就拿已经成立起来的两个业余中等技术学校来说，原计划开两个班，140人，现在已开了五个班，学员有278人，超过原计划近一倍。在这里学习的，有一般技术工人，有党组织的书记，局长。他们都坚持了每周上四个晚上的课，许多人在下课以后，以及星期天做作业。原来因力量不足，计划缓办业余技术学校的单位，也自己请教员，找教室办起来了。有些还自动组织互教互学小组（或班）。党中央关于知识分子问题指示下达以后，工程技术人员、医务人员都在订个人规划，要求提高业务技术水平，自动组织起来学习的很多，情绪十分高涨。
    职工们学习热潮高涨起来了，有人顾虑不能巩固。事实证明完全可以巩固起来。因为学员情绪高涨，正常秩序已经建立起来，教学质量也在不断提高。目前巩固矿工们的学习情绪和成就的关键，是继续提高教学质量，以满足矿工们的要求。现在教员们已重视走群众路线，吸收学员意见，随时改进自己的教学方法。如王封矿、李封矿业余学校实行定期召开班、组长会议制度办法，可以及时了解矿工对教学上的意见。其他如有计划有组织地进行观摩教学、举行作业展览，在寒暑假中对专任教员和兼任教员进行集训，提高他们思想水平和业务水平等，都是好办法。对学习好的学员和教学好的教员进行评比奖励，这样可以使先进的更先进，落后的赶上先进的。
    群众性的操作规程教育，是一种重要的技术教育。在进行这一种技术教育时，要求做好下面的四点：（1）规程教育与政治教育相结合；（2）规程教育与计划、技术管理相结合；（3）规程教育与当前所出事故教训相结合；（4）规程教育与实际技术操作相结合。
    我们已制定了文化技术学习全面规划。工人技术员和工程师将要在我们的矿山上出现了，文化技术落后的面貌就要根本改变了。
