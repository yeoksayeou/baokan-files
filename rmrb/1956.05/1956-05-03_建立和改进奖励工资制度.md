Establishing and Improving the Bonus Wage System

　　In the advanced producer movement, thousands of workers, engineering technicians, and management personnel have achieved outstanding results in production and construction. These people should not only be given spiritual encouragement, but also material rewards, in order to enhance and consolidate their production enthusiasm and motivate more employees to better complete the national plan.

　　Making each employee materially concerned about their labor results is one of the principles of socialist management. The bonus wage system in enterprises is a concrete manifestation of this principle. In the past few years, various state-owned enterprises have rectified the original bonus wage system and established some new bonus wage systems, which have played a certain role in encouraging the production enthusiasm of employees. However, the necessity of implementing material rewards has not been universally valued by various departments and enterprises. After some enterprises abolished the old, unreasonable reward system, they did not establish the new reward system that should have been established, and some even abolished the originally reasonable system. Some enterprises have overly harsh and unrealistic reward standards. Due to the fact that more were abolished and fewer were established, and the requirements were harsh, the number of people receiving rewards has decreased and the amount of bonuses received has also decreased since 1953. This phenomenon is obviously unfavorable to the development of production. The industrial, capital construction, and transportation departments should correct this deviation and quickly establish and improve the bonus wage system in enterprises to meet the requirements of industrial production, transportation, and capital construction development.

　　Establishing and improving the bonus wage system must proceed from production needs. That is to say, different bonus systems should be established according to the current production needs of the enterprise and the different production characteristics and work nature of the enterprise, so as to promote the improvement of labor productivity and overcome the weak links in production through the bonus wage system. At the same time, with the development of production, outdated bonus systems should be revised or abolished, and new bonus wage systems that meet production needs should be established in a timely manner. The bonus wage system of many enterprises is not compatible with the above requirements. For example, the main problems in the production of some enterprises are low quality and high costs, but these units implement over-production bonuses. This method of reward deviates from the main problems currently existing in the enterprise and cannot correctly exert the role of material rewards in improving production. Some enterprises stipulate bonus rates for various indicators such as output, quality, and savings, which will also stimulate workers to focus only on areas where it is easy to get bonuses. As a result, a lot of bonuses are spent, but the key problems in production are not solved. The leaders of these enterprises do not understand that the purpose of stipulating reward indicators is to clearly point out the direction of effort for employees. Therefore, in general, only certain reward indicators can be stipulated for a certain period of time. Too many indicators will distract employees and reduce the role of the bonus wage system.

　　Establishing and improving the bonus wage system must abide by the principle of "to each according to his work." That is to say, bonuses should be paid to employees based on the quantity and quality of their labor. When stipulating the proportion of bonuses, it should be differentiated according to the different positions of each industry and enterprise in the national economy and the different roles played by employees in the production process. The reward rate of important industries and enterprises should be higher than that of general industries and enterprises, and the reward rate of main production workers and main engineering technicians should be higher than that of general workers and general engineering technicians. At present, the phenomenon of egalitarianism generally exists in the bonus work of various enterprises. Some enterprises distribute bonuses equally, and all personnel, including odd-job workers, receive bonuses. Some factories operate in three shifts, but they do not distinguish between the quality of work of each shift and share the bonuses equally. The result of implementing this egalitarian bonus method is often that people who should not be rewarded receive rewards, while people who should be rewarded do not receive rewards, or receive very little. This not only fails to play a role in material encouragement, but also causes dissatisfaction among workers.

　　The reward indicators should be advanced, and at the same time, most employees should be able to achieve them through hard work, so as to encourage the production enthusiasm of employees, improve technical proficiency, and improve work quality. The reward indicators should not be changed too frequently, as frequent changes will damage the production enthusiasm of employees; but they should not remain unchanged for a long time either, as failure to revise them for a long time will not stimulate the improvement of labor productivity. In addition to stipulating reward indicators, it is also necessary to stipulate the reward conditions that are directly related to the reward indicators. For example, if a quality award is implemented, it must be stipulated that the reward can only be obtained if the quantity of the product is completed and the raw material consumption quota is not exceeded, and the specified quality reward indicators are reached or exceeded.

　　In order to adapt to the needs of fully completing and overfulfilling the first five-year plan, in addition to actively promoting the piece-rate wage system to encourage employees to overfulfill the plan, it is also necessary to actively establish and improve the reward system for trial production of new products, the reward system for saving raw materials, fuel, and electricity, and the reward system for improving product and work quality based on the principles of increasing variety, reducing costs, and improving quality. If a new product can be successfully trial-produced on schedule or ahead of schedule and proven to be qualified by technical appraisal, the relevant personnel involved in the trial production of the new product should be rewarded according to the importance of the new product in the national economy and the difficulty of the trial production. In the work of using a large amount or valuable raw materials, fuel, and electricity, a saving award should be given to the directly related personnel according to the amount of savings value and the difficulty of saving. While completing the quantity of products, workers must ensure the quality of the products. Therefore, under normal circumstances, a quality award should not be implemented; however, at present, some products particularly need to improve quality, and some equipment needs to further improve the quality of maintenance and repair. In this case, it is necessary to implement a quality award.

　　The comprehensive and over-fulfillment of the national plan by enterprises requires the enterprise leaders and engineering technicians to make arduous efforts. Therefore, when the enterprise comprehensively and evenly completes the state's total output value plan, the main product variety plan, the labor productivity plan, the cost reduction plan, and the quality indicators, the enterprise leaders and engineering technicians should be rewarded. The work of all personnel in the enterprise is directly or indirectly related to production. Therefore, other personnel in the enterprise who have made significant achievements in assisting in the completion and over-fulfillment of the national plan should also be rewarded to encourage their work enthusiasm.

　　Overcoming the confusion and unreasonable phenomena existing in the reward system and actively establishing and improving the bonus wage system is a very important task at present. The various industrial, capital construction, and transportation departments should quickly strengthen the inspection and guidance of this work. The local party committees should urge the industrial departments and trade union organizations of the party committees to pay attention to organizing various factories and mines to exchange experiences in improving the bonus wage system, so as to correctly exert the material encouragement role of rewards for production.

### 建立和改进奖励工资制度

　　建立和改进奖励工资制度
    在先进生产者运动中，成千上万的工人、工程技术人员和管理人员，在生产和建设当中创造了优异的成绩。对这些人，不仅应该给以精神上的鼓励，也应当从物质上给以奖励，以便提高和巩固他们的生产热情，激励更多的职工去更好地完成国家计划。
    使每个职工从物质利益上关心自己的劳动成果，是社会主义经营管理的原则之一。企业中的奖励工资制度，就是这个原则的一种具体体现。几年来，各个国营企业整顿了原有的奖励工资制度，建立了一些新的奖励工资制度，这对鼓励职工的生产热情起了一定的作用。但是，实行物质奖励的必要性并没有引起各个部门、各个企业的普遍重视。有些企业在取消了旧的不合理的奖励制度以后，没有把应该建立的新的奖励制度建立起来，有的甚至把本来是合理的制度也取消了。有些企业奖励标准过苛，不切实际。由于取消的多，建立的少，要求的苛，从1953年以来，得到奖励的人减少了，所得奖金的数目也降低了。这种现象对发展生产显然是不利的。各个工业、基本建设和交通运输部门应该纠正这种偏向，迅速建立和改进企业中的奖励工资制度，以适应工业生产、交通运输和基本建设发展的要求。
    建立和改进奖励工资制度，必须从生产需要出发。这就是说，要根据企业当前生产需要及企业生产特点和工作性质的不同，建立不同的奖励制度，以便通过奖励工资制度，促进劳动生产率的提高，克服生产中的薄弱环节。同时应该随着生产的发展，修改或是取消不适时的奖励制度，及时建立新的、合乎生产需要的奖励工资制度。不少企业的奖励工资制度同以上的要求是不相适应的。例如，有些企业生产中的主要问题是质量低，成本高，但是这些单位实行的却是超额奖。这种奖励的办法，离开了企业当前存在的主要问题，就不能正确地发挥物质奖励对提高生产的作用。有些企业把产量、质量、节约等各项指标都规定了奖金率，这也会刺激工人只向容易得奖的方面使劲，结果奖金开支不少，但是生产中的关键问题反而得不到解决。这些企业的领导人员不了解：规定奖励指标的目的，是明确地给职工指出努力方向，因此一般只能在一定时期规定一定的得奖指标，指标过多就会分散职工的注意力，降低了奖励工资制度的作用。
    建立和改进奖励工资制度，必须遵守“按劳付酬”的原则。这就是说，要根据职工劳动的数量和质量来给他们支付奖金。在规定奖金的比例的时候，应该根据各产业、各企业在国民经济中的不同地位，以及职工在生产过程中所起的不同作用而有所区别。应该使重要产业、企业的奖励率高于一般产业、企业，主要生产工人和主要工程技术人员的奖励率高于一般工人和一般工程技术人员。目前，各个企业的奖励工作中，普遍存在着平均主义现象。有的企业，将奖励金平均分配，所有人员、包括勤杂工在内，都一律得奖。有的工厂是三班操作，却不分各班工作好坏，分摊奖金。实行这种平均主义的奖励办法的结果，往往使不该奖的人得了奖，而应该奖的人反而得不到奖，或者得的很少。这就不仅起不到物质鼓励作用，反而引起工人的不满。
    奖励指标应该是先进的，同时又是大多数职工经过努力所能达到的，这样才能鼓舞职工的生产积极性，提高技术熟练程度，改善工作质量。奖励指标不应该变动太勤，如果变动太勤，就会损伤职工的生产积极性；但也不应该长期不变，如果长期不修改，也不能刺激劳动生产率的提高。除了规定奖励指标外，还要规定同奖励指标有直接关系的得奖条件。如实行质量奖，必须规定在完成产品的数量和不超过原材料消耗定额的条件下，达到和超过规定的质量奖励指标才能得奖。
    适应全面完成和提前完成第一个五年计划的需要，目前除了积极推行计件工资制，以鼓励职工超额完成计划以外，还应该根据增加品种、降低成本、提高质量的原则，积极地建立和改进新产品试制的奖励制度、节约原材料、燃料、电力的奖励制度，提高产品和工作质量的奖励制度。凡是新产品能按期或提前试制成功，并且经过技术鉴定证明合格的，应该根据这种新产品在国民经济中的作用大小和试制的难易程度，奖励试制这项新产品的有关人员。在使用大量或贵重的原材料、燃料、电力等工作中，应该根据节约价值的大小和节约的难易，对直接有关人员实行节约奖。工人在完成产品数量的同时，必须保证产品的质量，因此在一般情况下，不应该实行质量奖；但是目前某些产品特别需要提高质量，某些设备需要进一步提高维护检修的质量，在这种情况下，实行质量奖是必要的。
    企业全面和超额完成国家计划，需要企业领导人员和工程技术人员付出艰苦的努力。因此，当企业全面、均衡地完成国家的总产值计划、主要产品品种计划、劳动生产率计划、降低成本计划和质量指标的时候，就应该给企业的领导人员和工程技术人员以奖励。企业中所有人员的工作都直接或间接地关系着生产，因此，企业中其他人员对协助完成和超额完成国家计划有显著成绩的，也应该给予奖励，以鼓励他们的工作积极性。
    克服奖励制度方面存在的混乱和不合理的现象，积极地建立和改进奖励工资制度，是当前一项十分重要的工作。各个工业、基本建设和交通运输部门应该迅速加强对这一工作的检查和指导，各地方党委应该督促党委工业部和工会组织，注意组织各厂矿企业交流改进奖励工资制度的经验，以正确地发挥奖励对生产的物质鼓励作用。
