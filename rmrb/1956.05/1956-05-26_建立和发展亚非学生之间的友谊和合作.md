Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 25th: Indonesian Minister of Education and Culture Sarino believes that the Asian-African Student Conference is very important. He said that this conference can be regarded as a further implementation of the Bandung Conference resolution on cultural cooperation last year.

In a conversation published in the "Indonesian Torch" on May 24, Sarino emphasized that accusations that the student conference was presided over by communists were exaggerated. He said that, taking the Indonesian student delegation as an example, its members and observers represent various ideological tendencies, all student groups, and universities.

Minister Sarino hopes that the conference will be held as scheduled and reiterated that the Ministry of Education and Culture is prepared to give the conference all possible moral and material support.

Indonesian Social Groups
Hope the Conference Benefits the People of Asia and Africa
Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 25th: According to a report by Antara News Agency on May 24, the Executive Committee of the Indonesian Ministry of Education Employees Union sent a welcome telegram to the Asian-African Student Conference and wished the conference success.

The Executive Committee hopes that the conference can promote friendship among Asian and African students to strengthen the forces fighting against colonialism.

The Indonesian Islamic Students Association issued a statement on May 24 saying that it will contribute its greatest strength to the convening of the Asian-African Student Conference.

The association called on all sectors of society to provide assistance so that the conference can achieve results beneficial to the people of Asian and African countries.

Malayan Students Studying in Indonesia
Welcome the Conference to Promote Asian and African Student Contacts
Xinhua News Agency, May 24th: Singapore News: According to newspaper reports, the Federation of Malayan Students in Indonesia recently issued a statement supporting the convening of the Asian-African Student Conference.

The statement said that the Asian-African Student Conference is being held to promote relations and understanding between Asian and African students, which is in line with our principles.

The statement pointed out that the main problem facing Malayan students is that the Malayan education system is controlled by the British colonial authorities. We have absolutely no freedom of association.

The statement said that Malayan students should dedicate themselves to the cause of independence to defend Malaya.

International Reactionaries
Conspire to Sabotage the Asian-African Student Conference
Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 25th: The "Indonesian Torch" wrote on May 24 that international reactionaries want to sabotage the Asian-African Student Conference because they believe that this conference will become a threat to colonial forces.

The newspaper said that the conspiracy to sabotage this student conference is part of a comprehensive effort by reactionaries to prevent the formation of united forces against colonialism, because convening the student conference is to implement the resolutions of the Bandung Conference, which have had a profound impact on international politics.

The "Indonesian Torch" said that the reactionaries' clamor that the "Asian-African Student Conference is controlled by the Communist Party" is nothing new, but just the old tune that colonialists used to sing. The newspaper expressed its belief that despite these difficulties, the conference will eventually be held.

According to Indonesian newspaper reports, certain Western news agencies are disseminating malicious reports about the conference in an attempt to divert the attention of Asian and African students from the true purpose of the conference. At the same time, some Americans of unknown origin are conducting some activities. On May 23, a "delegation" from the "Coordinating Secretariat of the International Student Conference" led by Americans arrived in Jakarta. They requested to participate in the Asian-African Student Conference as observers. Qualified personnel from the International Preparatory Committee of the Asian-African Student Conference said that the committee had not invited such a "delegation."

Sixteen Student Delegations Arrive in Jakarta
Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 25th: As of May 24, sixteen student delegations had arrived here to participate in the Asian-African Student Conference.

These delegations are from: Burma, China, Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Indonesia, India, Japan, Jordan, Laos, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Philippines, Algeria, Madagascar, Morocco, Senegal and West Africa, Sudan, Tunisia.

More student delegations are about to arrive.

Chinese Student Delegation Issues Statement in Jakarta
Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 25th: The Chinese student delegation issued a statement on May 24 saying: Chinese student representatives have come here to participate in the Asian-African Student Conference with the ardent desire to establish friendship with students from all Asian and African countries.

The statement, issued to the Jakarta press by Qian Liren, head of the delegation, said: The convening of this conference is inseparable from the support given by the Indonesian government. We are encouraged by President Sukarno's speech on the Asian-African Student Conference, and we are also encouraged by Vice President Hatta's speech.

The statement said: We fully agree with the appeal of the All-Indonesia Student Conference: "We unanimously agree to the Bandung Spirit established at the Asian-African Conference last year. We hope to use it as the basis for cooperation between Asian and African students." We Chinese student representatives hope, in the spirit of the Bandung Conference, to discuss our common problems with student representatives from all Asian and African countries, and to establish and develop friendship and cooperation among us. We hope to do our best, together with representatives from other countries, to make the conference a success.

The statement said: We are encouraged by the fact that many student groups and governments in Asian and African countries support the convening of the Asian-African Student Conference and that many student delegations from these countries have already arrived in Indonesia. This proves once again that the idea of holding an Asian-African Student Conference reflects the aspirations of the broad masses of Asian and African students.

The statement said: We would like to express our sincere thanks to our Indonesian classmates, who have already made great contributions to the convening of the conference.

    建立和发展亚非学生之间的友谊和合作
    印度尼西亚文教部长说
    万隆会议关于文化合作的决议将由亚非学生会议进一步实现
    新华社雅加达25日电　印度尼西亚文教部长萨里诺认为亚非学生会议是非常重要的。他说，这次会议可以认为是去年万隆会议关于文化合作的决议进一步的实现。
    萨里诺在这一篇刊载在五月二十四日的“印度尼西亚火炬报”上的谈话中强调指出，有人指责这次学生会议是共产党人所主持的，这是过于言过其实了。他说，拿印度尼西亚学生代表团来说，它的团员和观察员就代表着各种不同的观念形态倾向、所有学生团体和大学。
    萨里诺部长希望会议如期举行，并再次表示文教部准备给予这次会议以道义上和物质上的一切支持。
    印度尼西亚各社会团体
    希望会议有益于亚非人民
    新华社雅加达25日电　据安塔拉通讯社五月二十四日报道：印度尼西亚教育部雇员工会执行委员会向亚非学生会议发出欢迎电，并预祝会议成功。
    执行委员会希望这次会议能够促进亚非学生之间的友谊以壮大反对殖民主义的斗争的力量。
    印度尼西亚回教学生协会在五月二十四日发表声明说，它将为亚非学生会议的召开贡献最大的力量。
    协会号召社会一切阶层给予帮助，使这次会议能够获得有益于亚非各国人民的成果。
    在印度尼西亚留学的马来亚学生
    欢迎会议促进亚非学生联系
    新华社24日讯　新加坡消息：据报纸报道，马来亚留印度尼西亚学生联合会最近发表声明拥护召开亚非学生会议。
    声明说，亚非学生会议的举行是为了促进亚非学生之间的关系和了解，这是符合我们的原则的。
    声明指出，马来亚学生面临的主要问题是马来亚的教育制度被英国殖民当局所控制。我们完全没有结社的自由。
    声明说，马来亚学生应该献身于争取独立的事业，来保卫马来亚。
    国际反动分子
    阴谋破坏亚非学生会议
    据新华社雅加达25日电　“印度尼西亚火炬报”五月二十四日写道，国际反动分子想破坏亚非学生会议，因为他们认为这个会议将成为对殖民势力的威胁。
    这家报纸说，破坏这次学生会议的阴谋是反动分子要阻止反对殖民主义的联合力量的形成的全面努力的一部分，因为召开学生会议就是实现万隆会议的决议，这些决议对国际政治起了深远的影响。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”说，反动分子所谓“亚非学生会议是受共产党控制”的叫嚣不是什么新调子，只是殖民主义者以前常唱的老调而已。这家报纸表示相信，尽管遭到了这些困难，会议终于还是会举行的。
    据印度尼西亚报纸报道，某些西方通讯社正在散发关于会议的恶意报道，企图转移亚非学生对会议的真正目的的注意。同时，一些来历不明的美国人正在进行一些活动。五月二十三日，雅加达来了一个由美国人率领的“国际学生会议协调秘书处”的“代表团”。他们要求作为观察员参加亚非学生会议。亚非学生会议的国际筹备委员会的有资格人士说，委员会并没有邀请过这种“代表团”。
    十六个学生代表团到达雅加达
    据新华社雅加达25日电　到五月二十四日为止，已经有十六个学生代表团到达这里来参加亚非学生会议。
    这些代表团来自：缅甸、中国、越南民主共和国、印度尼西亚、印度、日本、约旦、老挝、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、菲律宾、阿尔及利亚、马达加斯加、摩洛哥、塞内加尔和西非、苏丹、突尼斯。
    还有一些学生代表团即将到达。
    我国学生代表团在雅加达发表声明
    新华社雅加达25日电　中国学生代表团五月二十四日发表声明说：中国学生代表是怀着同所有亚非国家的学生建立友谊的热烈愿望，来到这里参加亚非学生会议的。
    这个由代表团团长钱李仁向雅加达报界发表的声明说：这个会议的召开是同印度尼西亚政府给予的支持分不开的。我们为苏加诺总统关于亚非学生会议的演说所鼓舞，也为副总统哈达的演说所鼓舞。
    声明说：我们完全赞同全印度尼西亚学生会议的呼吁：“我们一致同意在去年亚非会议上建立的万隆精神。我们希望把它作为亚非学生之间合作的基础。”我们中国学生代表希望本着万隆会议精神，同来自所有亚非国家的学生代表们讨论我们共同的问题，在我们中间建立和发展友谊和合作。我们希望尽我们的能力，同来自其他国家的代表们一起，使会议成功。
    声明说：我们为亚非国家的许多学生团体和政府支持亚非学生会议的召开和这些国家的许多学生代表团已经抵达印度尼西亚这个事实而感到鼓舞。这又一次证明，举行亚非学生会议的想法反映了亚非学生广大群众的愿望。
    声明说：我们愿意向我们的印度尼西亚同学表示我们真诚的谢意，他们对会议的召开已经作了巨大的贡献。
