Nanchang City’s Tangshan District Panfang Artificial Rainfall Irrigation Station was fully completed and tested on May 5th. This artificial rainfall irrigation station was built with a national investment of 40,000 yuan. It will irrigate more than 440 mu of vegetable fields for the Xinghui Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Nanchang City. Carrying water to water vegetables is the most arduous labor for vegetable farmers. Vegetable farmers reflect: the artificial rainfall station can not only ensure that vegetables are not affected by drought, but also save a large amount of labor for intensive farming and sideline production. The members are actively learning operating techniques to give full play to the role of the rainfall station.

    南昌市建成人工降雨灌溉站
    南昌市塘山区潘坊人工降雨灌溉站于五月五日全部建成试水。这个人工降雨灌溉站是由国家投资四万元建成的。它将给南昌市郊区星辉农业生产合作社灌溉菜地四百四十多亩。挑水浇菜是菜农最繁重的劳动，菜农反映：人工降雨站不但可保证蔬菜不受旱，而且节省了大批劳动力从事精耕细作和副业生产。社员们正积极学习操作技术，以发挥降雨站的作用。
