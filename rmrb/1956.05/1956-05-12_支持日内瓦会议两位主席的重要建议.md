    Supporting the Important Proposals of the Two Chairmen of the Geneva Conference
    The two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, in their letters of May 8 to both North and South Vietnam, the International Commission for Vietnam, and the French government, put forward important suggestions regarding the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam. The letters requested both sides of Vietnam to make every effort to implement the Geneva Accords on Vietnam, to prevent any future violations of the military clauses of the Geneva Accords, and to guarantee the fulfillment of the political clauses and principles stipulated in the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference. The letters also requested the International Commission to continue to contribute to the maintenance and consolidation of peace in Vietnam, with a view to restoring the unification of Vietnam through free all-Vietnam elections under the supervision of the International Commission. The letters also requested the French government to discuss with the South Vietnamese government measures to help the International Commission for Vietnam and the Joint Commission to carry out their tasks in the future. The letters also pointed out that, if necessary, the two chairmen would discuss separately the measures that should be taken to ensure the implementation of the Geneva Accords on Vietnam, including proposals for convening a new conference attended by the participating countries of the Geneva Conference and the member states of the International Commission. These suggestions of the two chairmen are in line with the demands of the people of all countries concerned with the peace and unification of Vietnam.
    Due to the obstruction and sabotage by the U.S. government and the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem government, the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam has suffered serious threats. According to the provisions of the Geneva Accords, both sides of Vietnam should have consulted on the issue of national free elections as early as July 1955. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has also repeatedly and specifically proposed consultations. However, under the instigation of the U.S. government, the Ngo Dinh Diem government has consistently refused to consult with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the issue of national elections. This has prevented the work of achieving unification of Vietnam through national free elections from beginning to this day. The Ngo Dinh Diem government's blatant refusal to implement the Geneva Accords has also created various difficulties for the work of the International Commission for Vietnam. Not only that, but the U.S. government and the Ngo Dinh Diem government have also colluded with each other, constantly violating the Geneva Accords, and importing military personnel and military materials into South Vietnam. Since the French Federal Forces announced their withdrawal from South Vietnam, the Ngo Dinh Diem government has intensified its harassment and provocative actions in the demilitarized zone. This has created a serious situation threatening peace in Vietnam. Under these circumstances, the suggestions of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference regarding the maintenance of the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam are of utmost importance.
    The suggestions of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, in fact, also negate the argument that the so-called South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem government has no legal obligation to fulfill the provisions of the Geneva Accords regarding national free elections in Vietnam. The Geneva Accords are a whole, and as the two chairmen pointed out, the provisions regarding national free elections in Vietnam are extremely important political clauses in this agreement. The so-called acceptance of the military clauses of the Geneva Accords while refusing to assume the obligations stipulated in the political clauses of the Geneva Accords is, in itself, self-contradictory. Moreover, according to the Geneva Accords, all countries participating in the Geneva Conference have the obligation to guarantee the full implementation of the Geneva Accords.
    The Chinese people have always been closely concerned about the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam. We sincerely hope that our neighbor, Vietnam, can become a unified and prosperous country on the basis of peace, democracy, and independence, in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords. We believe that the responsible authorities in South Vietnam should no longer delay the earnest implementation of all the provisions of the Geneva Accords and ensure the peaceful unification of Vietnam through national free elections. The United States, as one of the participating countries in the Geneva Conference, must also end all acts of obstructing and sabotaging the Geneva Accords. The Chinese people will closely watch the future development of the situation in Vietnam.

    支持日内瓦会议两位主席的重要建议
    关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的两位主席，苏联和英国，在五月八日给予越南南北双方、越南国际委员会和法国政府的信件中，对于日内瓦协议在越南的实施问题，提出了重要的建议。信件中要求越南双方尽一切努力来实现关于越南的日内瓦协议，防止今后对日内瓦协议的军事条款的任何违反，并且保证履行日内瓦会议最后宣言中所规定的政治条款和原则。信件中也要求国际委员会继续为维护和巩固越南的和平作出贡献，以期通过在国际委员会监督下的全越南自由选举来恢复越南的统一。信件中还要求法国政府同南越政府讨论有助于越南国际委员会和联合委员会今后执行任务的措施。信件中也指出，在必要的情况下，两位主席将另行讨论为保证履行关于越南的日内瓦协议所应该采取的措施，包括关于召开由日内瓦会议参加国和国际委员会成员国参加的新的会议的建议。两位主席的这些建议是符合于关心越南的和平与统一的各国人民的要求的。
    由于美国政府和南越吴庭艳政府的阻挠和破坏，日内瓦协议在越南的实施遭受到了严重的威胁。按照日内瓦协议的规定，越南双方早在1955年7月就应该就全国自由选举的问题进行协商。越南民主共和国政府也一再具体地提出了进行协商的建议。但是，在美国政府的怂恿下，吴庭艳政府一直拒绝同越南民主共和国协商全国选举的问题。这就使越南通过全国自由选举来实现统一的工作至今还没有能够开始。吴庭艳政府这种公然拒绝履行日内瓦协议的态度，对于越南国际委员会的工作，也造成了各种困难。不仅如此，美国政府和吴庭艳政府还互相勾结，不断违反日内瓦协议，把军事人员和军事物资输入南越。自从法兰西联邦部队宣布将撤出南越后，吴庭艳政府更变本加厉地在非军事区进行骚扰和挑衅的行动。这就造成了威胁着越南和平的严重的局势。在这种情况之下，日内瓦会议两位主席关于维护日内瓦协议在越南的实施的建议，是有极其重要的意义的。
    日内瓦会议两位主席的建议事实上也否定了所谓南越吴庭艳政府没有法律义务履行日内瓦协议有关越南全国自由选举的规定的论调。日内瓦协议是一个整体，而正如两位主席指出的，有关越南全国自由选举的规定是这一协议中的极其重要的政治条款，所谓接受日内瓦协议中的军事条款的部分而拒绝承担日内瓦协议政治条款所规定的义务，其本身就是自相矛盾的。而且，根据日内瓦协议，所有参加日内瓦会议的国家，都负有保证日内瓦协议的全部实施的义务。
    中国人民一向密切关心日内瓦协议在越南的实施。我们真诚地希望我们的邻邦越南能够按照日内瓦协议的规定，在和平、民主、独立的基础上成为统一和富强的国家。我们认为，南越的负责当局应该不再迟延地切实履行日内瓦协议的全部规定，保证通过全国自由选举来实现越南的和平统一。美国，作为日内瓦会议的参加国之一，也必须终止一切阻挠和破坏日内瓦协议的行为。中国人民将密切注视越南局势的今后发展。
