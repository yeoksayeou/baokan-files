Don't Let the Alarm Clock Be Less Accurate Than a Rooster

The poor quality of some industrial products in Shandong Province has aroused dissatisfaction among many consumers. Socks produced in Jinan would tear after being worn from Shangbu to Pulimen (both Shangbu and Pulimen are place names in Jinan), so consumers call them "Pulimen" brand socks. Some socks would dye feet and shoes the same color as the socks shortly after being worn. The undershirts and tank tops produced in Jinan shrink severely. Before washing, adults can wear them, but after washing, only children can wear them. Therefore, consumers call them "grandpa-grandson two-purpose undershirts." The peach酥 (shortbread) from a food factory in Jinan is too hard, and consumers call it "un-chewable peach酥". Users have reported that the paint produced by the Qingdao Paint Factory has three characteristics: it dries quickly, falls off quickly, and is expensive. Consumers believe that the alarm clocks produced by the Yantai Clock Factory "don't ring when they should, and are not as accurate as a rooster's crow."

The poor quality of these products has persisted for quite some time. Due to the poor quality of paint from the Qingdao Paint Factory, commercial departments had over 500 tons of stock in 1955. Since the beginning of this year, the factory has been on the verge of ceasing production. Therefore, whether from the perspective of meeting consumer needs or from the perspective of opening up product sales and avoiding the loss of state property, it is urgent to improve the quality of these products quickly.

    莫让闹钟不如公鸡准
    山东省有些地方工业的产品质量不好，已经引起许多消费者的不满。济南生产的袜子，有的从商埠穿走到普里门（商埠和普里门都是济南市的一个地名）就破了，所以被消费者称为“普里门”牌袜子。有的穿走不久，颜色把脚、鞋都染得跟袜子一样。济南生产的汗衫背心缩水很严重，没洗水以前大人可以穿，洗水以后，只能给小孩子穿。所以被消费者称为“爷爷孙子两用汗衫”。济南一食品厂的桃酥太硬，被消费者称为“啃不动的桃酥”。用户反映青岛油漆厂的油漆有三个特点：干的快、掉的快、价格高。消费者认为烟台造钟厂的闹钟“到时不闹，还不如公鸡叫得准确”。
    这些产品的质量不好，已经有相当长的时间了。青岛油漆厂的油漆因质量不好，1955年商业部门积压五百吨以上，今年以来，该厂几乎陷于停止生产的状况。所以，不论从满足消费者的需要来说，还是从打开产品的销路，避免造成国家财产的损失来说，迅速提高这些产品的质量是刻不容缓的。
