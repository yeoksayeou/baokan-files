Guarantee Complete Cotton Seedling Emergence in Cotton Fields

Cotton sowing in the Shijiazhuang Special District of Hebei Province was completed in early April, one solar term earlier than in previous years. However, according to the Special Commissioner's Office inspection, the germination rate of cotton fields in many areas is very low. For example, in Huheying Village, Xinji, because the sowing was too shallow, the germination rate of most cotton fields was only 39.1%; in Xingtang County, the germination rate of more than 4,000 mu of land was less than 50%; in Gaocheng, Luancheng and other counties, there were also many cotton fields with very few cotton seedlings, and some cotton fields even had to be replanted entirely.

In order to achieve close planting and ensure increased cotton production, the Shijiazhuang Special Commissioner's Office recently issued instructions requiring all counties to launch a seedling checking and replanting campaign. The instructions require all agricultural production cooperatives to organize seedling checking and replanting teams, mainly composed of technicians and skilled sowing workers, to divide up the work and contract responsibility, dig up the soil to check seedlings plot by plot, and replant as they check; at the same time, in conjunction with seedling checking and replanting, vigorously eliminate pests such as mole crickets, grubs, and wireworms.

The quality of cotton seedling emergence directly affects cotton production. Timely inspection of cotton sowing quality can enable timely remedial measures after the discovery of poor seedling emergence, ensuring full seedling emergence in all cotton fields.

    保证棉田出苗齐全
    河北石家庄专区的棉花播种，比往年提前一个节气，在四月上旬先后完成。但是，根据专署检查，不少地区棉田发芽率很低。如辛集胡合营村因播种太浅，大部分棉田发芽率仅达39.1％；行唐县有四千多亩地出芽率不足五成；藁城、栾城等县也有不少棉田棉苗很少，有些棉田甚至要全部重播。
    为了实现密植，保证棉花增产，石家庄专署最近发出指示，要求各县开展查苗补种运动。指示要求各农业生产合作社以技术员和播种能手为主组织查芽补种小组，分工包干，逐块挖土查芽，随查随补；同时，结合查芽补种，大力消灭蝼蛄、蛴螬、金针虫等害虫。
    棉苗出得好坏，直接影响着棉花产量。对于棉花播种质量及时进行检查，可以在发现出苗不好的情况以后及时补救，保证所有棉田全苗。
