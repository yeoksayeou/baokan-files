　　Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch from Paris: The North Atlantic Group Council meeting held in Paris on the 4th concluded yesterday evening. This morning, the meeting released a communiqué referred to as the military group’s "political declaration." The communiqué acknowledged that the Soviet Union’s policy of peaceful coexistence had contributed to the easing of international tensions, and welcomed this. However, the communiqué also stated that the North Atlantic Group does not intend to abandon its policy of "strength," saying: "Atlantic nations must continue to give priority to maintaining their unity and strength." As for the issue that became the focus of discussion at this meeting and was of great concern to many member states of the group—the issue of strengthening the group's political and economic cooperation—the communiqué only said that the meeting had appointed a three-person committee (composed of the foreign ministers of Italy, Canada, and Norway) to submit opinions to the council "as soon as possible" on methods and means to improve and expand the group's cooperation in non-military areas and strengthen its internal unity. The Associated Press said that the United States, France, West Germany, Italy, and Canada have already submitted their respective plans to the three-person committee; "but what is unclear is the extent to which the North Atlantic Group's partners are willing to adjust their political and economic policies."
    Reports on the meeting indicate that there are serious differences among the "Atlantic partners" regarding the future course and methods of operation of this military group.
    At the meeting on the 5th, the Council discussed general international situations, particularly the Far East, Middle East, North Africa, as well as disarmament and German reunification. When discussing the Far East issue, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles stated that the United States still stubbornly adheres to the attitude of forcing China to abandon the liberation of Taiwan in order to maintain the status quo of American occupation. The Associated Press said that Dulles also "poured cold water" on ideas such as increasing trade with China, diplomatically recognizing and accepting China into the United Nations, "ideas which are popular among some of the fourteen foreign ministers who listened to him."
    According to Agence France-Presse, heated debates unfolded among the representatives on the Middle East issue. Turkish Foreign Minister Köprülü vigorously supported the Baghdad Pact, while some delegations adopted a reserved attitude towards the treaty. Some delegations also adopted a reserved attitude towards the issue of transporting arms to the region.
    The meeting on the 5th also continued to discuss the "non-military forms" of the North Atlantic Group's activities. In this regard, according to Reuters, the plan proposed by French Foreign Minister Pineau to establish a "world economic development organization" to assist underdeveloped countries was met with a "lukewarm" reception from delegations from countries such as the United States, Britain, and West Germany. The French plan pointed out that the current provision of aid to underdeveloped countries does not depend on their needs, but rather on whether the recipient countries are willing to participate in a certain political system or even military alliances. It suggested establishing a "world economic development organization" affiliated with the United Nations to implement international supervision of aid. Sources say that on the suggestion of Dulles and others, the French proposal will be handed over to experts for "research."
    According to Agence France-Presse, at the meeting on the 4th, Dulles complained that there were still "too many differences" among some member states of the North Atlantic Group. Dulles opposed turning the North Atlantic Treaty into an economic organization. He suggested drafting a political and economic "ten-year plan" to replace the "Marshall Plan," which had served as a tool for American economic and political control in the past decade. Dulles's suggestion was adopted by the Council "in principle" at the meeting on the 5th.

### 北大西洋集团理事会会议在一系列争执中闭幕

　　北大西洋集团理事会会议在一系列争执中闭幕
    新华社6日讯　巴黎消息：四日在巴黎举行的北大西洋集团理事会会议已经在昨天晚上结束。今天上午，会议方面发表了一个被称为这个军事集团的“政治宣言”的公报。这个公报承认苏联的和平共处政策促成国际紧张局势的缓和，并且对这一点表示欢迎。但是，公报又表示，北大西洋集团并不打算放弃“实力”政策，它说：“大西洋国家必须继续对维持它们的团结和力量给予优先的考虑。”至于成为这次会议的讨论中心而且是这个集团许多成员国十分关切的问题——加强这个集团的政治合作和经济合作的问题，公报只是说，会议已经指定三人委员会（由意大利、加拿大和挪威的外交部长组成）就改善和扩大这个集团在非军事方面的合作和加强它的内部团结的方法和手段向理事会“尽早”提出意见。美联社说，目前美国、法国、西德、意大利和加拿大都已经向三人委员会提出了各自的计划；“但是弄不清楚的是：北大西洋集团的伙伴们在调整政治上和经济上的政策方面愿意作到什么程度”。
    有关会议的报道表明，“大西洋伙伴”之间对这个军事集团今后活动的途径和方式的问题有严重分歧。
    在五日会议上，理事会讨论了一般国际局势问题，特别是远东问题、中东问题、北非问题以及裁军和德国统一问题。在讨论远东问题的时候，美国国务卿杜勒斯表示，美国仍然抱着硬要中国放弃解放台湾以便保持美国占领的现状的态度。美联社说，杜勒斯还给同中国增加贸易、在外交上承认和接纳中国进入联合国等想法“泼了冷水，而这些想法在听他说话的十四国外交部长中间的一些人当中是很流行的”。
    据法新社说，在中东问题上，各国代表展开了激辩。土耳其外交部长柯普路鲁竭力拥护巴格达条约，而某些代表团则对这个条约采取保留态度。某些代表团还对把军火运往这个地区的问题采取保留态度。
    五日的会议还继续讨论关于北大西洋集团的活动的“非军事形式”问题。在这方面，据路透社消息，法国外交部长比诺提出的关于建立一个援助落后国家的“世界经济发展组织”的计划受到了美国、英国和西德等国代表团的“冷淡”对待。法国的计划指出，目前对落后国家给予援助并不是取决于它们的需求，而是取决于接受援助的国家是不是愿意参加某个政治体系或者甚至于军事性质的同盟。它建议建立一个隶属于联合国的“世界经济发展组织”来对援助实行国际监督。有消息说，在杜勒斯等人的建议下，法国的建议将交给专家们进行“研究”。
    据法新社说，在四日会议上，杜勒斯曾经抱怨北大西洋集团某些成员国之间还有“太多的分歧”。杜勒斯反对把北大西洋公约变成一个经济组织。他建议草拟一个政治、经济的“十年计划”来代替在过去十年中作为美国进行经济和政治控制的工具的“马歇尔计划”。杜勒斯的建议在五日会议上被理事会“在原则上”通过。
