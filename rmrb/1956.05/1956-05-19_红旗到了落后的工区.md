    Red Flag Arrives at a Backward Work Area
    Now, the Eighth Work Area of the Huada Drill Fabric Workshop in the Zhengzhou No. 3 State-Owned Cotton Textile Factory has not produced any substandard cloth for more than two consecutive months.
    Since the factory began production last year, the Eighth Work Area has never completed its monthly plan. The leading cadres and workers of the work area were very distressed.
    In mid-February, the factory launched a socialist competition. After studying the leadership experience of the Twelfth Work Area, Xue Yuzhai, the deputy foreman of the Eighth Work Area, actively sought out the trade union group leader and workers to jointly study the main reasons for failing to complete the production plan. The workers also criticized the negative sentiment of thinking "it can't be done anyway" and guaranteed not to let any substandard cloth pass during production. Activities of mutual teaching and learning were widely launched within the work area.
    In March and April, the entire work area did not produce any substandard cloth and completed the production plan, continuously receiving the workshop's Red Flag. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    红旗到了落后的工区
    现在，国营郑州第三棉纺织厂华达呢车间的第八工区，已经连续两个多月没出次布。
    从这个厂在去年投入生产以来，第八工区就没有完成过月计划。工区的领导干部和工人们都很苦闷。
    二月中旬，厂里开展了社会主义竞赛。第八工区副工长薛玉斋学习了十二工区的领导经验以后，积极地找工会小组长、工人，共同研究完不成产量计划的主要原因。工人们也批判了认为“反正搞不好”的消极情绪，保证在生产中不放过一点次布。工区内普遍展开了互教互学的活动。
    三、四两月全工区就没有出次布，并且完成了产量计划，连续得到了车间的流动红旗。（据新华社讯）
