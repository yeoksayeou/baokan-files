Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 17th. Sastroamidjojo said at a press conference today that one of the purposes of President Sukarno's visit to the United States is to tell the American authorities and people about Indonesia's struggle for complete freedom and independence. "This also includes our demand for Dutch-occupied West Irian."

The Indonesian Prime Minister said that Sukarno's visit to the United States is to strengthen mutual understanding between Indonesia and the United States, to make it understand Indonesia's independent foreign policy, and also to strengthen economic cooperation without any conditions, especially cooperation in construction. He said that President Sukarno's visit to the United States is not begging for assistance.

Sastroamidjojo said that international tensions have greatly eased, and relations between the East and West have improved. If both the East and West express their goodwill, mutual understanding and tolerance, and abide by the United Nations Charter and the ten principles of the Bandung Conference, war is not inevitable, and the Cold War can be completely eliminated.

When talking about the convening of the Second Asian-African Conference, the Prime Minister said that the five Colombo countries are studying the necessity and possibility of holding this conference. The Bandung Conference decided to consider convening the Second Asian-African Conference within two years, but this will depend on the international situation. He said that it is impossible to decide the time and place for holding the second conference this year, because the preparatory work itself will take a year.

When talking about the agreement on dual nationality signed between Indonesia and China last year, he said that he would discuss the issue again in the cabinet and then submit it to the parliament for approval.

He told reporters that Indonesia's first five-year plan will lay the foundation for future economic construction. The main points of this plan include increasing the output of crops, aquatic products and minerals, improving exports, establishing industries, improving transportation conditions, promoting mass education and rural construction, the most important of which is the construction of hydroelectric power plants, which will serve as the key to industrial construction. He said that the bill on the first five-year plan will be discussed by the cabinet and submitted to the parliament.

The Prime Minister said that the Indonesian government will establish commercial relations with Eastern European countries on a new basis. He said that the Soviet Union's proposal for economic assistance is also being considered by the government.

    沙斯特罗阿米佐约谈苏加诺访问美国等问题
    新华社雅加达17日电　沙斯特罗阿米佐约今天在记者招待会上说：苏加诺总统访问美国的目的之一是要把印度尼西亚为争取完全自由和独立的斗争告诉美国当局和人民。“这也包括我们对荷兰占领的西伊里安的要求在内。”
    这位印度尼西亚总理说：苏加诺访问美国是要加强印度尼西亚和美国之间的互相了解，使它了解印度尼西亚的独立外交政策，也是要加强不附带任何条件的经济合作，特别是在建设方面的合作，他说，苏加诺总统的访问美国并不是乞求援助。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约说：国际紧张局势已经大大缓和，东西方的关系已经得到改善。如果东西双方都表示它们的善意，相互谅解和容忍，并且遵守联合国宪章和万隆会议的十项原则的话，战争并不是不可避免的，冷战是完全可以消除的。
    这位总理在谈到召开第二次亚非会议的问题时说：五个科伦坡国家正在研究举行这个会议的必要性和可能性。万隆会议曾决定在两年内考虑召开第二次亚非会议，但是这将取决于国际局势。他说：今年是不可能决定举行第二次会议的时间和地点的，因为筹备工作本身就要用一年的时间。
    他在谈到印度尼西亚和中国在去年签订的关于双重国籍问题的协定时说，他将在内阁再次讨论这个问题，然后提交国会批准。
    他告诉记者说，印度尼西亚的第一个五年计划将为将来的经济建设奠定基础。这个计划的主要点包括提高农作物、水产和矿产的产量，改进出口，建立工业，改善交通条件，推行平民教育和乡村建设，其中最重要的是建设水力发电厂，以此作为工业建设的关键。他说，关于第一个五年计划的法案将由内阁讨论，并且提交给国会。
    这位总理说，印度尼西亚政府将在新的基础上和东欧国家建立商业关系。他说，苏联的经济援助建议也正在由政府考虑中。
