    Single Members' Cafeteria
    Duan Yingcong
    The Five-Three Agricultural Production Cooperative of Songta Township, Shouyang County, Shanxi Province, has put forward the following call to its members: each male laborer should average 250 workdays throughout the year, and each female laborer should average 120 workdays. In the first two months of this year, each male laborer in the cooperative averaged 40 workdays. However, due to the entanglement of housework such as "washing dishes, cooking, and making peat briquettes," 24 bachelors averaged only 15 workdays each, resulting in low morale. Bachelors cooking for themselves often eat meals late or early, hot or cold, hungry or full, which affects their health. To take care of the eating problem of single members, the Cooperative Management Committee helped them establish a cafeteria, based on the voluntary participation of the single members. The cafeteria adopted a management method of allocating portions by ticket, with those who eat more paying more, those who eat less paying less, and those who don't eat paying nothing. The single members elected Liu Si, an old man with weak labor power but some cooking skills, as the cook, and Li Hengyuan as the clerk. After democratic discussion, they stipulated that the clerk would receive a subsidy of 2 work points per day, and the cook would receive a subsidy of 6 work points (the work points are shared equally by those who eat in the cafeteria).
    With the establishment of the cafeteria, single members not only no longer have to worry about not having food to eat, but they can also improve their meals twice every seven days. The cafeteria also raises a small pig, planning to fatten it up and slaughter it for meat. The common reflection of the single members is: the advanced cooperative is really good, even the eating problem has been solved.
    After the cafeteria was established, the labor efficiency of the members increased. According to the understanding from February 27 to March 17, sixteen single members averaged 18 workdays each.

    单身社员的食堂
    段应聪
    山西省寿阳县松塔乡五三农业生产合作社向社员们提出这样一个号召：全年每个男劳动力平均要做到二百五十个工作日，每个女劳动力平均要做到一百二十个工作日。今年头两个月，全社每个男劳动力平均做四十个工作日。但是有二十四个单身汉，由于“洗碗做饭和打泥炭”等家务劳动的纠缠，平均每人只做到十五个工作日，因而生产情绪不高。单身汉自己做饭，总是迟一顿早一顿，热一顿冷一顿，饥一顿饱一顿，影响了身体健康。社务管理委员会为了照顾单身社员的吃饭问题，按照单身社员的自愿，帮助他们建立了一个食堂。食堂采用了以票定量、多吃多摊、少吃少摊、不吃不摊的管理办法。单身社员们推选了劳力弱而有一定做饭技术的刘四老汉担任炊事员，李恒元担任事务员。经过民主讨论，他们规定出每天给事务员补助二分工，给炊事员补助六分工（工分是由上灶吃饭的人均摊）。
    成立了食堂，单身社员不但不愁吃不上饭了，而且每七天可以改善两次伙食。食堂还喂一口小猪，准备喂肥了宰了吃肉。单身社员的共同反映是：高级社真是好，吃饭问题也解决了。
    食堂搞好后，社员劳动效率提高了。据二月二十七日至三月十七日的了解，十六个单身社员平均每人做了十八个工作日。
