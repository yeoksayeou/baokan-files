Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 26th -- Chinese airplanes have successfully flown and landed on the Tibetan Plateau, known as the "Roof of the World," creating an astonishing miracle in aviation history. The Beijing-Lhasa air route officially completed its trial flight today.

Today was a beautiful, clear day during the plateau's rainy season. At 9:23 AM, the lead transport aircraft on the trial flight from Beijing to Lhasa flew over numerous snow-capped mountains, through fierce winds and clouds at high altitude, and landed steadily at Lhasa Airport.

On the ground, over ten thousand jubilant people jumped and cheered towards the sky. As the plane landed, Tibetan people immediately rushed forward to present hadas (ceremonial scarves) to the aircraft and scatter qingke barley for blessings, shouting "Tashi Delek" (good fortune). Some ran to the front of the plane to present colorful flowers to the aviation personnel. Taiji Gaxueba·Queji Nyima, representative of the Tibetan local government, and Xiangji·Sonam Dorje, representative of the Panchen Kanpo Lhentse Committee, stepped forward to present hadas to the aviation personnel, shake hands with each of them, and take group photos in front of the aircraft. Chen Mingyi, commander of the Civil Aviation Airport Construction Command, and Wang Jianzhong, representative of the Communist Party organization of the Airport Construction Command, also warmly shook hands with the aviation personnel, congratulating them on their glorious trial flight.

For thousands of years, transportation between the Tibetan Plateau and the interior of the motherland was limited to rugged postal routes and trails. Even after the completion of the Kangzang and Qingzang highways, it still required arduous journeys of half a month to a month. From today onwards, traveling by plane from Lhasa to Beijing will only be a ten-hour aerial journey. Relevant departments are preparing to open Beijing-Lhasa air transport services, which will powerfully promote the accelerated development of economic, cultural, and other construction endeavors in the Tibetan region.

The Tibetan Plateau has complex terrain, rapidly changing weather, and lacks accurate maps and clear flight markers. Therefore, it was considered an "air forbidden zone" before liberation. The aviation personnel of New China, with perseverance and heroic spirit, opened up this plateau air route in a short period.

Ground staff overcame difficulties such as thin air and lack of tools, establishing navigation points and the world's highest airport capable of ensuring regular air traffic in sparsely populated valleys and grasslands. They also organized large-scale ground material transportation to ensure the extension of the air route.

Pilots, flying their aircraft, explored suitable flight paths kilometer by kilometer. They flew over the Kunlun Mountains, Bayan Har Mountains, Tanggula Mountains, and the famous Hengduan Mountains. They engaged in countless heroic struggles against high-altitude winds traveling at speeds of one or two hundred miles per hour, turbulent and surging malignant vertical air currents, and severe cold and hailstorms of minus thirty to forty degrees, finally completely breaking through the "air forbidden zone."

Han Lin, the captain of the lead aircraft, told Xinhua News Agency reporters after his plane landed: Following the lead aircraft, several more transport planes will be landing here. For the aviation personnel of New China and the members of the Communist Party of China, there are no insurmountable difficulties.

### 北京—拉萨航空线试航成功

    北京—拉萨航空线试航成功
    据新华社拉萨26日电　中国飞机在号称“世界屋脊”的西藏高原上成功地飞行和着陆，创造了航空史上惊人的奇迹。北京—拉萨航空线今天正式试航成功了。
    今天是高原雨季中一个美丽的晴朗的日子，上午九时二十三分，第一架从北京试航拉萨的领队运输机飞越了重重雪山，冲过了高空中的凛冽风云，稳健地着陆在拉萨机场上。
    在地面上，一万多狂欢的人跳跃着，对空中欢呼。当飞机降落下来后，藏族人民立即跑上前去，往飞机上挂哈达、撒青稞祝福，他们高呼“扎喜德来”（吉祥如意）。有的跑到机前向航空人员献彩花。西藏地方政府代表台吉噶雪巴·却吉尼玛和班禅堪布会议厅委员会的代表香吉·索南多杰，走向前去向航空人员献了哈达，和他们一一握手，并且在机前合影留念。民航机场修建指挥陈明义和机场修建指挥部共产党组织的代表王建中，也和航空人员热情握手，祝贺他们这次光荣的试航。
    千百年来，西藏高原和祖国内地之间的交通只有崎岖的驿道和便道。康藏、青藏公路修通以后，仍需要半月到一个月的长途辛劳跋涉。从今天起，坐飞机从拉萨到北京只是十来个小时的空中旅行了。有关部门正在准备开办北京—拉萨空运业务，这将有力地促进西藏地区经济、文化等各项建设事业的加速发展。
    西藏高原地形复杂，气候变化很快，并且没有准确的地图和缺少明显的飞行标志，所以解放前一直被划为“空中禁区”。新中国的航空人员以坚忍不拔的精神和豪迈的气魄，在短短的时间里开辟了这条高原航线。
    地面工作人员们克服了空气稀薄、工具缺乏等困难，在人烟稀少的山谷和草原上建立起导航点和可以保障经常通航的、世界上最高的航空站，并且组织了大规模的地面物资运输，保证航线向前伸延。
    飞行员们驾驶着飞机，一公里一公里地向前探索适宜飞行的航路。他们飞遍了昆仑山、巴颜喀拉山、唐古拉山和著名的横断山脉的上空。他们和每小时一、二百里速度的高空风和像怒潮一样汹涌澎湃的恶性垂直气流以及零下三、四十度的严寒冰雹，进行了无数次的英勇搏斗，终于彻底突破了“空中禁区”。
    领队机机长韩琳在他驾驶的飞机着陆后，对新华社记者说：继领队机之后，还有好几架运输飞机要来这里降落。对新中国的航空人员、中国共产党员来说，没有克服不了的困难。
