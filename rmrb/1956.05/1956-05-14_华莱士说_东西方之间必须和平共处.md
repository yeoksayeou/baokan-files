Xinhua News Agency, New York, May 12th (TASS): Former U.S. Vice President Henry Wallace published an article in "Life" magazine stating that he believes the issue of peace is the most important issue in the U.S. election campaign.

Wallace said: He now believes, as he always has, that peaceful coexistence in which the East and West compete is a must. "The days of encirclement and the threat of atomic and hydrogen bombs must give way to a future: the human intellect's race to invent will be devoted to rapidly innovating technology and expanding world trade."

Wallace criticized the passive policies pursued by the United States, which have caused the United States to lose the "sympathy of so many countries."
