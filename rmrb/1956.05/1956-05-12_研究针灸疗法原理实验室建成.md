    Laboratory for Studying the Principles of Acupuncture Therapy Completed
    A laboratory for studying why traditional Chinese acupuncture and herbal medicine can cure diseases has been preliminarily completed in Shanghai.
    This laboratory was designed and equipped by Professor Kuang Ankun, director of the Department of Internal Medicine Teaching and Research Group of Shanghai Second Medical College, and other professors.
    Kuang Ankun and others plan to explore why acupuncture can treat diseases from four aspects: the human nervous system, endocrine system, blood cells, and serum components. They have already trial-manufactured a volume recorder that can observe the activity of the nervous system from changes in blood vessels in the arm, and various instruments for protein electrophoresis analysis.
    Kuang Ankun has been engaged in the study of the body's response to various stimuli for more than twenty years.

    研究针灸疗法原理实验室建成
    研究中医针灸和中药为什么能治病的实验室已经在上海初步建成。
    这个实验室是上海第二医学院系统内科教研组主任邝安堃教授和其他教授设计和装置的。
    邝安堃等准备从人体的神经系、内分泌系、血球和血清成分等四个方面来探测针灸为什么能治疗疾病。他们已经试制了可以从手臂上的血管变化观察神经系活动的体积描记器和作蛋白质电泳分析的各种仪器。
    邝安堃从事各种刺激在人体上的反应的研究已经有二十多年。
