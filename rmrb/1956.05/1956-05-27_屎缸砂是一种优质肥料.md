    Privy Sand is a High-Quality Fertilizer

    Editor's Note: The Fertilizer Department of the Ministry of Agriculture believes that reader Zhuang Weiliang's suggestion is correct. Privy sand is a crystalline fertilizer extracted from latrines or chamber pots. According to the analysis of the East China Agricultural Science Research Institute, it contains 4.48% total nitrogen and 33.7% phosphorus (P2O5), making it a good natural fertilizer worthy of promotion. Currently, there is a habit of using this fertilizer in Yuyao, Cixi, and Jinhua in Zhejiang, and some areas in Fujian. The Jinjiang Prefectural Farm in Fujian once experimented with dipping rice seedling roots in privy sand (locally called "bucket arsenic"), and the results showed that the seedlings survived quickly and turned green about a week earlier than usual, and tillering also started one growth cycle earlier; moreover, the crops were taller and the ears were longer. The Fertilizer Department of the Ministry of Agriculture believes that privy sand is relatively expensive and has a low yield, so it is best to adopt centralized fertilization and economical fertilization methods on the basis of applying organic fertilizers. Generally, three to five jin per mu is sufficient.

    Editor:
    Last autumn, I worked in the countryside of Chuansha County, Jiangsu Province, and found many sailing boats transporting privy sand from northern Jiangsu to Zhejiang. What is privy sand used for? I inquired about it. It turns out that this is a high-quality fertilizer with high fertilizer efficiency and long-lasting fertilizer effect. Applying only twenty or so jin per mu can eliminate the need for large-scale fertilization for three consecutive years.

    In the countryside, in latrines with shelters, privy sand (also known as "feces essence") appears on the walls of the privy after long use. Most of the privy sand accumulates in the middle of the privy, with less at the mouth and bottom of the privy. Generally, it takes about ten years for the sand to accumulate to a thickness of one fen. The privy sand adheres firmly to the side of the privy. When taking it, the excrement in the privy must first be cleared out, the privy washed clean, and then a carpenter's chisel is used to make grooves in the privy sand (opening a groove every one and a half to two inches), and then the privy sand is scraped off with a knife.

    The usage of privy sand is as follows: after drying, it is ground into a fine powder like fertilizer powder using a stone mortar or stone mill, and then it can be applied to the field alone or mixed with plant ash.

    However, this high-quality fertilizer, which is available everywhere, has not yet been widely utilized. Therefore, I suggest that the agricultural departments in various places promote this fertilizer and organize local farmers to use it locally.

### 屎缸砂是一种优质肥料

    屎缸砂是一种优质肥料
    编者按：农业部肥料处认为读者庄维良的建议是正确的。屎缸砂是一种从毛坑或便桶里打下来的结晶肥料。据华东农业科学研究所分析，其中含全氮4.48％，磷（P2O5）33.7％，确是一种值得推广的良好自然肥料。目前浙江余姚、慈溪、金华等地和福建部分地区都有使用这种肥料的习惯。福建晋江专署农场曾经试验用缸砂（当地叫桶砒）醮秧根，结果秧苗成活快，复青一般提早一星期左右，分蘖也随着提早一个节令；而且作物植株较高，穗较长。农业部肥料处认为，缸砂价格较高，产量较少，因此最好在施用有机肥料的基础上采用集中施肥和经济用肥方法，一般每亩用三市斤到五市斤就够了。
    编辑同志：
    去年秋天，我在江苏省川沙县农村里工作，发现有很多帆船把苏北的屎缸砂运往浙江去。屎缸砂有什么用呢？我打听了一下。原来，这是一种肥效高、肥劲长的优质肥料，一亩地只要上二十几市斤就可以连续三年不要大量施肥。
    在农村里，有棚厕所的屎缸用的日子长了，缸壁上就出现了屎缸砂（也称粪精）。缸砂大部分聚积在屎缸的中部，缸口和缸底较少。一般情况，大约每十年才积砂一分厚。缸砂牢牢地粘在缸边上，在取用的时候要先将缸内粪便清出，将缸洗净，然后用木匠的铁凿在缸砂上打好槽（每隔一寸半到二寸间开一条槽），再用刀把缸砂剔下来。
    缸砂的用法是：晒干后用石臼或石磨碾成像肥田粉一样的细粉，就可以单独或拌草木灰在地里施用。
    但是，这种各地都有的优质肥料，目前还没有被普遍利用起来。因此，我建议各地农业部门推广这种肥料，组织当地农民就地使用。
