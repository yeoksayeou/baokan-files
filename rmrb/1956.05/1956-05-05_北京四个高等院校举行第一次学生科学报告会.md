　　Beijing Four Universities Hold First Student Science Report Conference
    On the 4th, students from four universities in Beijing, including Tsinghua University and Beijing Agricultural University, held their first student science report conferences to celebrate "May Fourth" Youth Day.
    At the Tsinghua University Student Science Report Conference, students from the Department of Radio Engineering reported to the conference on the successful process of their preliminary design of a television set using the mechanical scanning principle, which was welcomed by everyone.
    Ding Jincheng, a student from the Department of Plant Protection at Beijing Agricultural University, reported at the meeting on the scientific achievements of his collaboration with another student in "The Search, Propagation, and Application of Antibiotic Bacteria." According to indoor experiments, the more than fifty kinds of antibiotic bacteria they found have resistance to seedling diseases of cotton and kenaf, and rot pathogens of sweet potatoes and citrus.
    The topics reported by students from Beijing Geological College, such as "Geological Conditions of Babaoshan" and "Mesozoic Stratigraphic Sequence of the Western Hills of Beijing," were all results of their professional or holiday field investigations and research.
    The Student Scientific Research Achievement Exhibition held by Tsinghua University and Beijing Agricultural University in conjunction with the report conference also opened on the 4th, showcasing scientific instruments, models, and asexually hybridized chicks carefully made by the students.
    Beijing Agricultural University and Beijing Medical College also held the inaugural meeting of the Student Scientific Research Association on the 4th.

　　北京四个高等院校举行第一次学生科学报告会
    四日，清华大学、北京农业大学等四个高等院校的学生分别举行第一次学生科学报告会，庆祝“五四”青年节。
    在清华大学学生科学报告会上，无线电工程系学生向大会报告了他们利用机械扫描原理初步设计电视机成功的经过，受到大家的欢迎。
    北京农业大学植物保护系学生丁金城在会上报告了他和另外一个同学合作的“抗生菌的寻找、繁殖和应用”的科学成果。他们寻找出来的五十多种抗生菌，据室内试验，对棉花、洋麻的苗期病害，甘薯、柑橘腐烂病菌都有抵抗能力。
    北京地质学院学生报告的“八宝山地质情况”、“北京西山中生代地层顺序”等题目，都是他们结合专业或在假日到野外勘查、研究所得的成果。
    清华大学和北京农业大学为配合报告会举办的学生科学研究成果展览会也在四日开幕，分别展出了学生们精心制作的科学仪器、模型和无性杂交的雏鸡等实物。
    北京农业大学和北京医学院四日还举行了学生科学研究协会成立大会。　（新华社）
