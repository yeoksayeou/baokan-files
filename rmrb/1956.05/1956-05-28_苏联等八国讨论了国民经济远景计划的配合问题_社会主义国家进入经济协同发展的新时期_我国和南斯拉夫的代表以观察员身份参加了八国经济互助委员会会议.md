Xinhua News Agency, May 27th - From May 18th to 25th, the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon) of the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania held its regular meeting in Berlin. Representatives of the People's Republic of China and Yugoslavia attended the meeting as observers. A communiqué was issued at the conclusion of the meeting, as follows:

From May 18 to 25, 1956, the regular session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance was held in Berlin.

The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance meeting discussed the mutual coordination of the development of the main sectors of the national economies of the participating countries, such as machine building and optical instrument industry, ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy, coal, petroleum and gas industry, chemical industry, light industry, and agriculture, in the next five years (1956-1960).

The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance meeting adopted recommendations concerning the agreed-upon production levels and mutual supply of basic types of machinery and equipment, raw materials, fuels, and food among the countries.

When reviewing the development prospects of the machine building and optical instrument industry, the meeting formulated measures to expand the production specialization of each country and ensure further technological improvement.

The meeting reviewed the development of the raw material base for the development of the ferrous metallurgical industry (mining of iron ore and coking coal and production of coke) and the development of the raw material base for the non-ferrous metallurgical industry.

Economic cooperation among the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance will inevitably play an important role in ensuring that the European People's Democratic countries obtain hard coal from Poland and iron ore from the Soviet Union.

When reviewing the long-range plans for agricultural development, the meeting noted the issue of a substantial increase in agricultural production, especially a substantial increase in grain production. The meeting considered it necessary to ensure the widespread planting of corn. The meeting also formulated recommendations to vigorously expand the mineral fertilizer industry and further develop the production of modern agricultural machinery.

The meeting attached great importance to the issue of ensuring the power supply required by the national economies of the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance meeting discussed and adopted a work plan aimed at formulating recommendations on expanding the exchange of electricity among the participating countries, as well as on developing comprehensive development proposals for the hydropower resources of the Danube River.

The meeting reviewed and adopted a resolution on expanding the direct links between the relevant ministries and competent authorities of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance member countries to improve economic and scientific and technological cooperation.

The representatives of the People's Republic of China and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia attended the meeting of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance as observers.
