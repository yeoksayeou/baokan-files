    Hangzhou Third Municipal Hospital's Use of Antimony Agents to Treat Schistosomiasis
    Tu Zhengfeng
    From the autumn of 1955 to early March of this year, Hangzhou Third Municipal Hospital in Zhejiang Province has successively cured two hundred schistosomiasis patients using antimony agents. According to the results of continuous stool examinations of ninety patients who were discharged earlier, no parasite eggs were found. This proves that antimony agents can radically cure schistosomiasis.
    When these two hundred patients were admitted to the hospital, most of them had the general symptoms of schistosomiasis: schistosoma eggs in their stool; physical weakness, fatigue, dizziness, and poor appetite. Some had advanced symptoms such as high fever, vomiting blood, abdominal pain, stool containing pus and blood, enlarged liver and spleen, mild ascites, jaundice, and severe anemia. Hangzhou Third Municipal Hospital calculated the total dosage of antimony agents that each person should receive based on the patient's condition and weight and set a treatment schedule. For patients in good physical condition without special conditions, the daily dose was appropriately increased to shorten the course of treatment to fifteen days; for patients in poor physical condition, the daily dose was reduced, and the course of treatment was extended to twenty days. If severe vomiting or other reactions were observed during the treatment process, the antimony agent injection was stopped, and adjuvant treatments with vitamins, glucose, and other drugs were used, or the dose of the antimony agent was reduced, and the course of treatment was extended. Because the medical staff closely monitored the patients' condition, regularly checked their physical condition, and especially carefully observed changes in the patients' heart, liver, kidneys, and spleen, and implemented a protective medical system, not only were general patients able to recover and be discharged on schedule, but also patients with jaundice, nutritional deficiencies, and severe anemia were ensured safe treatment and discharged after recovery.
    Here is an example. Liang Huaiqin, a twenty-seven-year-old worker from the state-owned Hangzhou Gouguan Factory, had suffered from schistosomiasis for four years, frequently experiencing fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weakness, and even felt short of breath when walking empty-handed. The factory had sent him to the Hangzhou Workers' Health Hospital for treatment, but jaundice appeared during the antimony agent treatment. According to past medical books, antimony agents were contraindicated for jaundice. The doctor stopped the treatment and asked the patient to return to the factory for recuperation. On October 17 last year, the factory sent him to Hangzhou Third Municipal Hospital. At that time, the patient had parasite eggs in his stool, mild enlargement of the liver and spleen, yellow sclera, a jaundice index of ten units, and a positive liver function test "卄". After consultation between doctors of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, it was decided to first provide the patient with increased nutrition to restore his health. After nine days in the hospital, the patient's spirits improved, and his appetite increased. At this time, the doctor performed another detailed examination, which proved that the patient's liver was only mildly damaged. The patient's jaundice was a manifestation of the schistosoma releasing toxins in the body, eroding the liver, and impairing liver function; antimony agents are contraindicated for people with unhealthy heart, liver, kidneys, and spleen. However, this patient's heart and kidneys were healthy, and his liver and spleen were only mildly damaged. If vitamins, glucose, and other nourishing drugs are used to protect the liver, combined with small doses of antimony agent injections, the liver will not be damaged by the antimony agent injection, and the schistosoma in the body can be killed; at the same time, the compensatory effect of liver function can be used to restore liver function to normal, and the jaundice will disappear. If treatment is not given in time, the liver damage will become increasingly serious, leading to cirrhosis of the liver, and the patient will suffer greater pain. After repeated research, it was decided to administer a small dose injection of 0.03 grams of 1% antimony agent on that day. After observing for a day, the patient had no reaction. The doctor then determined the patient's total antimony dose and course of treatment based on the patient's weight and proceeded with treatment. On the first day, 0.03 grams of 1% antimony agent was administered intravenously; from the second day to the fifth day, 0.04 grams was injected daily; from the sixth day to the tenth day, 0.06 grams was injected daily; from the eleventh day to the fifteenth day, 0.07 grams was injected daily; from the sixteenth day to the nineteenth day, 0.06 grams was injected daily; and on the last two days, 0.05 grams was injected daily. During the injection process, the patient had no fever, vomiting, or other reactions. On the seventeenth day, three stool incubation tests were performed, and no parasite eggs were found. The blood test showed that the jaundice index had dropped to seven units (the normal jaundice index is seven to eight units). After thirty days, the patient recovered and was discharged.
    The reason why Hangzhou Third Municipal Hospital's use of antimony agents to treat schistosomiasis can achieve such results is mainly because the medical staff has a serious medical style, carefully observes the condition, breaks with conventions, and uses drugs cautiously and boldly. The treatment of patient Qiu Luru is also a good example. When the cumulative total amount of antimony agent injected reached 0.25 grams, the doctor found that the patient's heartbeat was irregular, and the patient felt slightly dizzy. The medical staff paid close attention to observation at any time. At night, it was discovered that in addition to the irregular heartbeat, the patient's pulse had dropped to fifty beats per minute, and intermittent pulses appeared. The doctor immediately gave the patient injections of vitamins B and C and glucose. Two hours later, the patient, who had no subjective symptoms and suddenly developed heart changes, turned the corner from danger.

    杭州市立第三医院用锑剂治疗血吸虫病的效果
    屠正峰
    从1955年秋季到今年三月上旬，浙江杭州市立第三医院先后用锑剂治愈了二百个血吸虫病人。根据出院较早的九十人连续复查大便的结果，没有发现虫卵。证明锑剂是可以根治血吸虫病的。
    这二百个病人入院的时候，大部分都有血吸虫病患者的一般症状：大便中有血吸虫卵；体质瘦弱、无力、头昏、食欲差。有的人则有发高烧、呕血、腹痛、大便带脓血、肝脏、脾脏肿大、轻度腹水、黄疸及严重贫血等晚期症状。杭州市立第三医院根据病人的病情和体重计算出每个人应接受锑剂注射的总药量，定出治疗的日程。病人体质尚好，无特殊病症的，就适当地增加每日用药量，缩短疗程至十五天；病人体质较差的，则减少每日用药量，延长疗程至二十天。假若在治疗过程中，发现有严重呕吐或其他反应，就停止锑剂注射，改用维生素、葡萄糖等药物作辅助治疗，或减少锑剂的药量，延长疗程。由于医务人员严密地注意了病人的病情，随时检查病人体质，特别是细心观察病人心、肝、肾、脾脏的变化，贯彻执行了保护性医疗制度，不仅一般病人都能如期病愈出院，就是患有黄疸、营养缺乏和重度贫血的病人，也保证了安全治疗，病愈出院。
    这里有一个例子。国营杭州沟管厂二十七岁的工人梁槐钦，患血吸虫病四年了，经常发烧、腹痛、腹泻、无力，连空手走路也感到气急。工厂曾把他送到杭州市工人保健院治疗，但是在用锑剂治疗的过程中出现了黄疸。按照过去医学书籍上的记载，黄疸禁忌锑剂。医生便停止了治疗，叫病人回厂休养。去年十月十七日，工厂又把他送到杭州市立第三医院。当时，病人大便中有虫卵，肝、脾脏轻度肿大，眼巩膜发黄，黄疸指数十单位，肝功能试验阳性“卄”。经中西医会诊，决定先给病人增加营养，恢复健康。住院九天后，病人精神好转，食量增加。这时，医师又作了一次详细的检查，证明病人肝脏只是受到轻度损害。病人出现黄疸，是血吸虫在人体内放出毒素侵蚀肝脏，使肝脏机能受到损害的表现；锑剂对心、肝、肾、脾脏不健康的人是禁忌的。但是，这个病人的心、肾脏都健康，肝、脾脏还只有轻度损害。如果用维生素、葡萄糖等滋补药物，保护肝脏，同时配合锑剂小量注射，不会因锑剂注射使肝脏受到损害，而可以杀死人体内的血吸虫；同时，还可以借肝脏机能的代偿作用，使肝功能恢复正常，黄疸也就会消失。如果不及时予以治疗，肝脏损害将日渐严重，以至发生肝硬变，病人将会受到更大的痛苦。经过这样反复的研究，决定当日用1％锑剂0.03克作小量注射。观察了一天，病人没有反应。医师就根据病人的体重定出病人的总锑剂量和疗程，进行治疗。第一天用1％锑剂0.03克作静脉注射；第二天至第五天，每天注射0.04克；第六天至第十天，每天为0.06克；第十一天至第十五天，每天为0.07克；第十六天至第十九天，每天为0.06克；最后两天每天注射0.05克。在注射过程中，病人没有发烧、呕吐等反应。到第十七天，曾作大便孵化三次，没有找到虫卵，血液化验黄疸指数已下降至七单位（正常人的黄疸指数是七—八单位）。三十天后，病愈出院。
    杭州市立第三医院使用锑剂治疗血吸虫病能收到这样的效果，主要是医务人员医疗作风严肃，仔细观察病情，打破成规，谨慎大胆用药。对病人丘闾如的治疗也是一个很好的例子，当注射锑剂累积总量达到0.25克的时候，医师发现病人心跳不规律，病人感觉稍有头昏。医护人员就随时注意观察。夜间，发现病人除心跳不规律外，脉搏跳动已降至每分钟五十次，并且有间歇脉出现。医师就立即给病人注射维生素乙、丙和葡萄糖。二小时后，这个无自觉症状而突然发生心脏变化的病人就转危为安了。
