　　Vibrant Laws, People's Judicial Work
    — Impressions of New China's Judicial Work by Italian Legal Professionals Visiting China —
    By Our Staff Reporter

    The four distinguished Italian legal professionals who have been visiting China for nearly a month, before their departure, spoke freely to our reporter about their impressions of China. These guests from the country that produced the famous ancient Roman law were particularly interested in the new Chinese legal system and judicial work.

    Riso, an experienced lawyer of the Italian Supreme Court and former Socialist Party member of parliament, emphasized the relationship between judicial work and the national political system. He pointed out: "The judicial system and political system of any country are inseparable; they are both built on a specific social system. Precisely because China's current social system is one that seeks the welfare of the entire people, rather than just a certain class, China's judicial system is a guarantee of the interests of all the people, and is a guarantee in fact, not just in form." He believes that China's abolition of the old legal system was entirely correct, as they were tools used by the ruling class to oppress the people. Riso said: Provisions in the Chinese Constitution, such as the Supreme People's Court being responsible to the National People's Congress, the implementation of the people's assessor system in people's court trials according to the law, and the requirement that all state organs must accept supervision from the masses, all embody the spirit of Chinese law in safeguarding the rights of the people.

    This lawyer of the Supreme Court studied China's labor reform methods and, along with his friends, visited Beijing's prisons and talked with prisoners. He spoke of his observations in this regard, saying: "Your prison system, which combines punishment and education for criminals, is a very good system. The principle of reforming criminals through labor is also stipulated in Italian law, but unfortunately, it is not fully implemented." His opinion was endorsed by his three friends.

    Another Italian Supreme Court lawyer, Professor Natoli of the University of Messina Law School, added: "New China's laws are full of vitality, not only because they are constantly developing, but also because they are tailored to the needs of the people. Your laws have close ties with the people because the people participate in the work of formulating laws. The vitality of your laws can be felt not only in the courtroom, but also in factories, agricultural producers' cooperatives, and various other places. Your litigation procedures are simple, but the trials are fair and effective. This is based on the high degree of humanism possessed by those engaged in judicial work. In trying cases, they always exert every effort to find the correct conclusions and appropriate solutions."

    Old Judge Griva, over seventy years old and the First Honorary President of the Turin Court of Appeal, spoke more about his observations on China's trial work. He said: Although China's legal code is not yet complete, judging from the trials, the judges are well-versed in legal principles, so the trials are conducted well. He was deeply impressed by the spirit of China's courts in conscientiously handling cases according to the law. He was very moved by the fact that Chinese law stipulates that convicted criminals can be granted probation or have their sentences reduced based on their performance during their sentences. He said: "This is a very good method because it can encourage those who have committed crimes to turn over a new leaf." Regarding civil trials, Griva raised a question: He wondered whether, in trials conducted by one judge and two assessors, the judge who is familiar with the law would be swayed by the opinions of the two assessors who are less familiar with the law when delivering the verdict?

    Professor Nosella, who specializes in the study of ancient Roman law, expressed his opinions from another perspective. He said: "It is difficult for a person who studies legal history to separate law from the actual conditions of society." Therefore, during his stay in China, he learned about China's situation not only from the scope of judicial work but also from various aspects of national life. After understanding China's judicial work from this perspective, his conclusion was that Chinese law embodies the lives of the people. He said: "Your government is composed of people from all classes, and it has the advantages of the democratic governments of ancient Rome, but it is much more perfect. I have deeply realized from the facts I have seen with my own eyes: (1) The People's Government of China is the Chinese people's own government, and your constitution and other important laws are truly submitted to the government for implementation by people from all walks of life. (2) The People's Government of China is a government that serves the people. Your government not only cares about the common interests of the people but also safeguards the interests of individuals, only requiring individuals not to harm the public interest for their personal interests. (3) The Chinese government guarantees the rights of everyone. Your government does not simply regard criminals who generally deviate from the cause of human progress as enemies of society but as objects that should be reformed."

　　有生命力的法律，人民的司法工作
    ——意大利访华法律工作者谈对新中国司法工作的印象——
    本报记者
    在我国进行了将近一个月参观访问的四位意大利有名望的法律工作者，在他们离去之前曾对本报记者畅谈他们对我国的观感。这几位来自产生过著名的古罗马法的国度的客人，对新中国的法律制度和司法工作特别感到兴趣。
    经验丰富的意大利最高法院律师、前社会党议员里索强调司法工作和国家政治制度的关系，他指出：“任何一个国家的司法制度和政治制度是不可分开的，它们都是建筑在一定的社会制度的基础上。正是因为中国今天的社会制度是一个为全民而不是只为某一个阶级谋福利的社会制度，所以中国的司法制度是对全体人民利益的保证，而且是事实上而不只是形式上的保证。”他认为我国废弃了旧的法制是完全正确的，因为它们是过去统治阶级压制人民的工具。里索说：中国宪法中关于最高人民法院对全国人民代表大会负责、人民法院审判案件依照法律实行人民陪审员制度、一切国家机关必须接受群众监督等规定，都体现了中国法律保障人民权利的精神。
    这位最高法院的律师研究过我国的劳动改造办法，并和他的朋友们一同参观过北京的监狱，还同犯人们谈过话。他谈到关于这方面的观感说：“你们对罪犯实行惩罚与教育相结合的监狱制度是一种很好的制度。对罪犯进行劳动改造的原则在意大利的法律上也有规定的，但很可惜并没有贯彻实行。”他的意见得到他的三个朋友的赞同。
    另一位意大利最高法院的律师、麦西尼大学法学教授纳托利补充说：“新中国的法律富有生命力，这不仅因为它是不断发展的，而且因为它是切合人民的需要的。你们的法律同人民有紧密的联系，因为人民参加了制定法律的工作。你们的法律具有生命力，这不仅在法庭上可以感觉到，而且在工厂、农业生产合作社和其他各个地方都可以感觉得出来。你们的诉讼程序很简单，但审判公正而有效。这是基于从事审判工作的人员具有高度的人道主义精神。他们在审判案件中，总是用尽一切力量去找到正确的结论和恰当的解决办法。”
    七十多岁的老法官、都灵上诉法院第一名誉院长格里瓦更多地谈到他对我国的审判工作的观感。他说：中国虽然目前法典还未完备，但是从审判看来，审判官都是深知法理的，所以审判进行得很好。他对我国法院认真依法办事的精神有深刻的印象。他对于我国法律中规定对已判刑的罪犯可以缓刑或者根据罪犯在服刑期间的表现而减刑这一点很受感动。他说：“这是一种很好的办法，因为这样能够鼓励犯了罪的人改过自新。”关于民事方面的审判工作，格里瓦提出了一个问题：他怀疑，审判由一个审判员和两个陪审员进行，熟悉法律的审判员在宣判时会不会为两个不大熟悉法律的陪审员的意见所左右？
    专门研究古罗马法的法学教授诺塞拉从另外一个角度来发挥他的意见。他说：“一个研究法律史的人是很难把法律同社会的实际情况分开的。”因此他在中国期间不仅是从司法工作的范围，而且从国家生活的各个方面来了解我国的情况。他从这个角度了解我国司法工作之后得出的结论是：中国的法律体现了人民的生活。他说：“你们的政府是由各个阶级组成的，它具有古罗马时代的民主政府的优点，但比它们更加完美得多。我从亲眼看到的事实深深体会到：（一）中国人民政府是中国人民自己的政府，你们的宪法和其他重要的法律都是真正由各阶层人民提交给政府施行的。（二）中国人民政府是为人民服务的政府，你们的政府不仅关心人民的共同利益，而且也维护个人的利益，只是要求个人不为个人的利益损害公共的利益。（三）中国政府保障一切人的权利，你们的政府对于一般背离了人类进步事业的罪犯，不是简单地把他们看作社会的敌人，而是看作应当改造的对象。”
