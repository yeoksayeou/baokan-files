What Hinders Us From Boldly and Correctly Promoting and Using Cadres
—Letters from Party Members—

Editor:

Many places and many organizations are crying out for a lack of cadres, and are asking higher leading organs to transfer some cadres to them from other places and other organizations. It seems that these places and organizations are truly experiencing a cadre shortage. The reality is not so. Many places and organizations still have great cadre potential, and there are many cadres who can be promoted and used. Henan Province's Zhongmu County is an example.

This year, Zhongmu County not only expanded its original leading organs, but also established many new leading organs. Thus, it was necessary to allocate a batch of cadres to fill these organs. Does Zhongmu County have the conditions to solve this cadre problem? The answer is yes. According to the understanding of 754 cadres in five units of Zhongmu County by the work group of the Organization Department of the Kaifeng Prefectural Committee of the CPC Henan Provincial Committee, 72 of them are fully qualified to be promoted to county and district-level cadres. These cadres have the characteristics of being politically reliable, highly conscious, loyal to the Party, active in their work, and proficient in their business. This shows that as long as cadres are boldly and correctly promoted, it is entirely possible to fill the current shortage of sixty county and district cadres in the county. Why can't the leaders of Zhongmu County see this cadre potential? The main reason is that they have serious right-leaning conservative ideas in the selection of cadres, and have stipulated many red tapes, resulting in a very abnormal phenomenon: almost every department has cadres who can be promoted to leadership positions, but none have been promoted. This has caused serious losses to the work. For example, the Organization Department and the Propaganda Department of the County Party Committee have been without ministers for a long time, no one is managing cadre work, and propaganda work is not being done well.

What exactly are the red tapes in Zhongmu County's cadre selection work? In a nutshell, there are "three ranks, three fears, and eight no-promotions." What are the "three ranks"? This is: ranking the length of time of participation in work and Party membership, taking qualifications and Party membership as the main or even the only conditions for selecting cadres; ranking positions, mechanically stipulating that those who have not served as secretary of the district committee cannot serve as ministers of the county party committee, those who have not served as directors of the district cannot serve as section chiefs in the county, and those who have not served as section chiefs cannot serve as department or bureau chiefs; ranking the time of appointment, regardless of their moral character and ability, those who were appointed earlier are promoted, and those who were appointed later are not promoted. For example, there is such a cadre who, according to his working ability and attitude, can be promoted to a county-level leading position; however, because he started working in 1951, the county party committee did not promote him when studying the matter, on the grounds that "the time of participation in work is too short, the actual training is still lacking, and the old comrades are not convinced."

What are the "three fears"? This is: fearing that they will not be able to do the job after being promoted; fearing that promotion will affect the emotions of other cadres; fearing that they will be transferred away by higher authorities after being promoted. For example, when the county federation of cooperatives was studying the promotion of a director of a cooperative, although the third deputy director of the cooperative had better moral character and ability and could be competent for the position of director, he was not promoted because he was afraid of affecting the work emotions of the first and second deputy directors.

"Eight no-promotions" refers to eight types of people who are not promoted. What eight types of people are these? These are: new cadres have no experience and are not promoted; young people have no prestige and are not promoted; intellectuals lack practical training and are not promoted; women have many children and are not promoted; those who have been service personnel are not promoted; those who have made mistakes are not promoted; those who like to make suggestions are not promoted... All of these, although not explicitly stipulated, are not the case in every organization and department in Zhongmu County; however, in many county organizations, they have indeed become an invisible red tape. For example, in a certain unit, there are thirteen female cadres, six of whom are active in their work and have good moral character and ability, and can be promoted, but none of them have been promoted. This erroneous view of discrimination against women is not only held by the leading cadres of individual units, but also by the county committee. For example, there was a female cadre who was originally prepared to be promoted to a leading position, but later the county committee disagreed because she gave birth to a child. There is a cadre in the County Public Security Bureau who is active in his work and politically reliable, and can and should be promoted to section chief; however, Wang Zechun, the deputy director of the bureau, disagreed, because: "If he is not promoted, he will constantly make suggestions; if he is promoted, he will not be able to lead!"

The above-mentioned red tapes in the selection of cadres are probably not unique to Zhongmu County, and exist to varying degrees in various regions, organizations, and enterprises. It is clear at a glance that these red tapes seriously violate the Party's policy of selecting cadres with both moral character and ability, suppress the growth of new forces, and hinder the full play of the enthusiasm of cadres!

### 什么东西阻碍着我们大胆地正确地提拔和使用干部——党员来信——

    什么东西阻碍着我们大胆地正确地提拔和使用干部
    ——党员来信——编辑同志：
    许多地方许多机关都在叫喊缺乏干部，都在要求上级领导机关从别的地方别的机关调配给他们一些干部。好像这些地方这些机关真是发生了干部荒的问题。事实不是如此，不少地方不少机关的干部潜力还很大，可以提拔使用的干部还很多。问题就在于这些地方这些机关不敢大胆放手地去提拔使用干部。河南省中牟县就是一个例子。
    今年，中牟县不但原有的领导机关扩大了，而且建立了不少新的领导机关，这样，需要调配一批干部来充实这些机关。中牟县有没有条件来解决这个干部问题呢？答复是肯定的。根据中共河南省开封地委组织部工作组对中牟县五个单位的754名干部的了解，其中有72名完全有条件提拔为县、区级干部，这些干部都具有政治可靠、觉悟较高、对党忠诚、工作积极和业务较熟练等条件。这就说明了，只要大胆地和正确地提拔干部，要补足全县现有的六十个县、区干部的缺额，是完全可能的。中牟县领导方面为什么看不到这种干部潜力呢？主要是因为他们在选拔干部工作上存在着严重的右倾保守思想，规定了不少清规戒律，结果便出现了一种很不正常的现象：几乎是各个部门都有可以提拔起来担任领导工作的干部，但是都没有提拔。这就给工作带来了严重损失。比如县委组织部和宣传部，就是因为长期没有部长，干部工作没人管理，宣传工作做得不好。
    中牟县在选拔干部工作上究竟有哪些清规戒律呢？用一句话来回答，有“三排、三怕和八不提”。什么是“三排”呢？这就是：排参加工作时间和党龄长短，把资历和党龄作为选拔干部的主要的甚至唯一的条件；排职务，机械规定没有当过区委书记的人，就不能当县委的部长，没有当过区的主任的人，就不能当县里的股长，没有当过股长的人，就不能当科、局长；排任职时间的早晚，不管德才条件怎样，提任职时间早的，不提任职时间晚的。例如，有这样一个干部，按照他的工作能力和工作态度来说，是可以提拔担任县级领导职务的；但是因为他是1951年参加工作的，县委在研究的时候就以“参加工作时间太短，实际锻炼还差，老的不服气”为理由而没有提拔。
    “三怕”又是什么呢？这就是：怕提拔起来干不了；怕提拔起来影响别的干部的情绪；怕提拔起来以后被上级调走。例如，县联社在研究提拔某社社主任的时候，虽然该社第三副主任的德才条件较好，可以胜任主任的职务，但因怕影响第一、第二副主任的工作情绪，就没有提拔。
    “八不提”，是指的有八种人不提拔。有哪八种人呢？这就是新干部没有经验，不提拔；年轻人没有威信，不提拔；知识分子缺乏实际锻炼，不提拔；妇女孩子多，不提拔；当过勤杂人员的，不提拔；犯过错误的人，不提拔；好提意见的人，不提拔……。所有这些虽然没有明文规定，也不是中牟县的每个机关和每个部门都是这样做的；但是在不少县机关中，确已无形中变成了一种清规戒律。例如，某单位有十三个女干部，其中工作积极、德才条件都好，可以提拔的有六个，但是一个也没有提拔。这种歧视妇女的错误观点，不仅个别单位的领导干部有，就是县委会也不例外。例如，有一个女干部，原准备提拔地担任领导职务，后来因为地生了一个孩子，县委就不同意了。县公安局有个干部工作积极，政治可靠，可以也应该提拔为股长；但是该局副局长王泽春不同意，原因是：“不提拔他，他还不断提意见；提拔起来了，才领导不了哩！”
    上述选拔干部工作中的清规戒律，恐怕不是中牟县独有的现象，在各个地区、各个机关和各个企业部门中或多或少地存在着。这些清规戒律之严重地违反了党的德才兼备的干部政策，压制了新生力量的成长，妨害了干部的积极性的充分发挥，是一目了然的！
