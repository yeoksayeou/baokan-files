Title: Why is Rural Economic Life Abnormal?

　　Unacceptable Prohibitions
　　Not long ago, in Jiang'an County, Sichuan Province, an incident occurred involving the crude interference in rural economic life.
　　Lin Chunchao, the Party Secretary of the Fourth District, noticed that some farmers and agricultural cooperative members were going to the primary markets during the busy spring plowing season to buy production and daily necessities, and to sell various agricultural and sideline products as well as local specialties. He believed that going to the market was delaying agricultural production. He then ordered all nine primary markets in the district to immediately cease operations. Furthermore, he changed the farmers' customary market schedule of every three days to every ten days. At the same time, he fixed the market days for these nine rural markets, which originally rotated on the 1st, 4th, and 7th, and 3rd, 6th, and 9th of each month, to be held simultaneously on one day. In Tieqing Township, cadres even stipulated that farmers were not allowed to go to the market during the day, but only in the dark of night without lights. As a result, farmers could not sell what they wanted to sell, nor could they buy what they needed to buy, which severely affected spring plowing and hindered rural economic life and the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. This matter was later corrected by the local leadership.
　　Farmers are Crying "Money is Tight"
　　An abnormal phenomenon has emerged in the rural areas of Yuci Prefecture, Shanxi Province: agricultural cooperative members are universally crying "money is tight," and many members even have to ask the cooperative director for money to buy oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar.
　　Why is this "money is tight" phenomenon occurring? This is because the area suffered a drought last year, and farmers' income from selling grain decreased somewhat. At the same time, after the realization of full socialist collectivization last winter, farmers have been busy with collective labor such as accumulating fertilizer and agricultural capital construction, and sideline income has also significantly decreased.
　　Of course, among those crying "money is tight," many are not truly short of money; they are just afraid of "revealing their wealth" and are following suit. However, the problem of farmers lacking pocket money does indeed exist. This is a new problem that has emerged after collectivization, and only by carefully studying and solving this problem can we increase farmers' confidence in running advanced cooperatives well and invigorate rural economic life.
　　The Evil Consequences of Forced Investment
　　Recently, many agricultural production cooperatives have seen the phenomenon of restricting members from purchasing daily necessities and forcing members to invest in the cooperative.
　　In Maoji Township, Xinzhou County, Hubei Province, a female cooperative member bought eight feet of floral flannelette for a quilt cover from the supply and marketing cooperative. After she left, a staff member from the agricultural production cooperative came to the supply and marketing cooperative to inquire about what she had bought. Some cooperative members who wanted to buy some daily necessities were afraid of being seen by staff members and dared not buy them during the day. In some places, when peddlers came to the village to deliver goods, very few people came to buy; but as soon as they left the village, people would secretly follow to buy.
　　It is clear that restricting farmers from purchasing daily necessities cannot achieve the goal of increasing farmers' enthusiasm for investing in the cooperative. The result of this practice can only stagnate the rural market and damage farmers' enthusiasm for production.
　　Leave Farmers Some Time for Sideline Occupations
　　In some agricultural production cooperatives in Pingtan County, Fujian Province, sideline production has been squeezed out during spring plowing, which has not only failed to solve the living problems of some members, but has also affected the work of other departments. For example, the Pingyuan Township agricultural production cooperative in this county does not allow members with difficulties to take some time to engage in sideline occupations, resulting in more than 20 members having no money to buy firewood or rice. However, the township's supply and marketing cooperative and grain station have a lot of materials piled up because they cannot find anyone to carry them. The Tanzhen Township agricultural cooperative also has sixty households of members who are having a hard time because they cannot take time to engage in sideline occupations. On the other hand, the town's aquatic product company needs people to process fish products, the grain bureau needs people to sun grain, and the salt bureau needs people to carry salt, but they cannot find anyone. The Ronghu Township granular fertilizer factory pays one yuan for carrying a day’s worth of “black earth” but still cannot find anyone to do it. The factory processing standard sand is about to shut down because it cannot hire people to transport sand. Other handicraft industries, such as rice flour and vermicelli processing, also cannot hire people to process, and these non-staple foods have not been available on the market for a month. The masses are dissatisfied, saying, “Women cannot even buy vermicelli to eat after giving birth.”

### 农村经济生活为什么不正常

　　农村经济生活为什么不正常
　　要不得的禁令
    不久前，四川江安县发生了一件粗暴地干涉农村经济生活的事。
    第四区区委书记林春超看到有些农民和农业合作社员，在紧张的春耕中去到初级市场上赶场，购买生产、生活用品，并且出卖各种农副业产品和土特产品，便认为：赶场太耽误农业生产时间了。他就命令全区的九个初级市场，马上停止活动，并且，把原来农民习惯的三天一场，改为十天一场；同时，把原来这九个乡场按一、四、七，三、六、九轮流赶场的日期，一律固定在一天内同时举行。在铁青乡，干部还规定不准农民白天赶场，把赶场的时间规定在没有灯光的黑夜。这样一来，农民要出卖的东西卖不出去了，要买的东西买不进来了，这就严重地影响了春耕生产，妨碍农村的经济生活和城乡物资交流。这件事，后来被当地领导机关纠正了。
    农民喊“钱紧”了
    山西省榆次专区的农村里，出现了一种不正常的现象：农业生产合作社社员普遍叫喊“钱紧”，许多社员买油盐酱醋也向社主任要钱。
    为什么会发生这种“钱紧”的现象呢？这是因为去年这一带遭受了旱灾，农民卖粮收入减少了些；同时，去年冬天这里实现全社会主义的合作化以后，农民都忙于积肥和农业基本建设等集体劳动，副业收入也显著地减少了。
    当然，喊“钱紧”的人里面也有相当多的人并不是真缺钱，他们只是因为怕“露富”，才跟着喊的。但是农民缺乏零花钱的问题的确是存在的。这是实现合作化后出现的新问题，只有很好地研究和解决这个问题，才能提高农民办好高级社的信心和活跃农村经济生活。
    强迫投资的恶果
    最近，不少农业生产合作社发生了限制社员购买生活用品、强迫社员向社投资的现象。
    湖北省新洲县毛集乡的一位女社员到供销合作社买了八尺花哔叽被面，她走了以后，就有农业生产合作社的一个工作人员到供销社来了解她买了什么东西。有些农业合作社的社员想买点生活用品，因为害怕工作人员看见，不敢在白天去买。有的地方，货郎担送货来到村庄，很少有人来买东西；但是一走出村庄，就有人偷偷地跟来买。
    可见限制农民购买生活用品，不能达到提高农民向社投资的积极性的目的。这种作法的结果，只能使农村市场停滞起来，使农民的生产积极性受到损伤。
    给农民留点时间搞副业
    福建省平潭县部分农业生产合作社在春耕生产中，由于挤掉了副业生产，不仅使一些社员的生活问题得不到解决，还影响了别的一些部门的工作。例如这个县平原乡农业生产合作社不让有困难的社员抽点时间去搞副业，结果有二十多个社员无钱买柴、买米；而这个乡的供销社和粮站有很多物资，却都因为找不到人挑而积压起来了。潭城镇农业合作社有六十多户社员，也因为不能抽时间去搞点副业，日子难过。另一方面这个镇子里的水产公司加工鱼产品、粮食局翻晒粮食、盐务所挑盐等工作需要人却找不到。榕湖乡颗粒肥料厂，挑一天
  “黑土”出一元钱，还找不到人干。加工标准砂的工厂，因为雇不到人运砂，就要停工。别的手工加工业，如米粉、挂面等副食品加工业，也雇不到人加工，市场上已经有一个月买不到这些副食品了。群众不满意地说：妇女分娩也买不到挂面吃。
