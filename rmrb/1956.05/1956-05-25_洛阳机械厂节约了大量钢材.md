    Luoyang Machinery Plant Saves a Large Amount of Steel
    The Luoyang Machinery Plant manufactured twenty six-to-eight-ton road rollers from January to mid-May. In the past, the front and rear wheels of the road rollers were forged with six-inch-thick steel plates, but now cast iron is used without affecting the performance. Calculating a savings of two and a half tons of steel per road roller, the plant has saved a total of fifty tons of steel for the country.

    洛阳机械厂节约了大量钢材
    洛阳机械厂从一月到五月中旬共制造出六吨到八吨重的压路机二十部。压路机的前轮和后轮过去都用六英分厚的钢板锻造，现在在不影响使用效果的情况下改用了生铁。以每部压路机节省两吨半钢材计算，总共为国家节省了五十吨钢材。
