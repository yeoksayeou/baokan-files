Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Representatives to the National Conference of Advanced Producers continued their speeches on the 7th, after spending a pleasant Sunday. The writer Lao She said at today's meeting: "We must advance, advance, and advance again, and build our beautiful and incomparably great motherland with eternal joy and encouragement! This is not just a pretty and nice-sounding remark, it is our oath! Pride and complacency are the most terrible traps we dig with our own hands. We swear never to suffer this loss." Liu Xuefo, a cotton-growing expert and platoon leader of a certain unit of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps, reported on his experience in this regard at the meeting. He said: "I will always remember that in 1953, after I created the highest cotton yield record in the country, I developed some feelings of pride. The instructor noticed it and immediately told me: 'Without the cultivation of the Party and the support of the masses, one cannot achieve any success...'" He talked about how, after overcoming this erroneous thought with the help of the Party, he achieved even greater results in 1955. He finally assured the conference: In the future, he will never be complacent or arrogant, and will strive to study the advanced cotton-growing techniques of the Soviet Union and other countries around the world. His speech was met with thunderous applause from the audience.

A total of eleven advanced producer representatives spoke at the conference today, including Zhuang Minggeng, a lathe worker at the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory who completed five years' worth of work in two years and eight months; Wang Zhisui, a specially invited representative of the Railway Corps who proposed a large number of improvements in bridge and culvert designs during the construction of the Yingxia Railway, thereby saving the country a large amount of investment; Zhang Guangdou, director and professor of the Hydraulic Structure Teaching and Research Group of the Hydraulic Engineering Department of Tsinghua University, who earnestly studied Soviet experience and improved teaching methods; and Gu Yuansong, captain of the South China Sea No. 163 ship, who led the crew to heroically resist enemy aircraft's repeated strafing and bombing and achieved victory. Gu Siren, deputy captain of the carpentry team of the Meishan Reservoir Engineering Headquarters, Liu Yuying, a female salt worker from the No. 7 Salt Plant of the Huaibei Salt Affairs Administration, Mo Jiarui, captain and chief pilot of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration's "People No. 1" ship, Zhang Yuqin, a teacher at the branch school of Baoshou District Complete Primary School in Yushu County, Jilin Province, and Han En, director of the "Happiness Road" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiaohe, Jilin, a specially invited representative of agricultural production cooperatives, also spoke at the meeting. Deng Zihui, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the Seventh Office, and Wang Shoudao, Director of the Sixth Office of the State Council, both spoke at today's meeting.

Yesterday, more than 20 advanced producer representatives from the timber industry visited the Beijing Guanghua Timber Factory and shared their experiences with the factory workers; ophthalmologists from eight delegations including Sichuan, Tibet, and Yunnan exchanged experiences at the Beijing Tongren Hospital. In addition, some representatives toured and gathered at the Summer Palace, the Temple of Heaven, Beihai Park, and the Zoo.

    先进生产者在发言中表示
　　永远不自满、不骄傲地奋勇前进
