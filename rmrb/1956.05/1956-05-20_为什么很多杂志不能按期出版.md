To the Editor:

    I am a staff member of the Beijing Post Office, responsible for the distribution of newspapers and magazines. I want to report a situation to you: many magazines published in Beijing cannot be published on schedule, which has already caused serious dissatisfaction among readers.

    The failure of magazines to be published on schedule is a serious problem that has not been resolved in publishing work for a long time. For example, out of the 154 issues of magazines that should have been published in March 1955, 83.12% were published late; calculated by number of copies, 62.08% were not published on time. The Publication Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture paid attention to this problem at the time and inspected the magazines that were published late. The situation improved significantly in April. Out of the 143 issues of magazines that should have been published this month, only 53.85% were published late; calculated by number of copies, only 23.37% were published late. However, due to the lack of strict requirements on the magazine publishers, the situation became more and more serious after a few months. By March of this year, the number of issues published late reached 72.63%, and the number of copies published late reached 61.81%.

    The late publication of magazines is most prominent in the youth, popular, art, foreign language and China Women's Publishing Houses. For example, out of the seven magazines published by the China Youth Publishing House, a total of twenty-seven issues were published from January to March 1956, and only one issue was published on schedule. The total number of days delayed reached 163 days. "China Youth" and "Middle School Students" were delayed by an average of six or seven days per issue, and "Literary Study" was delayed by an average of nine days per issue. For another example, although the timeliness of "Current Affairs Handbook" published by the Popular Reading Materials Publishing House is very strong, it is also often published late. The fifth issue of 1956 was delayed until after the sixth issue, 21 days later than the original publication date. "Rural Work Newsletter" was originally scheduled to be launched on February 20, but the Popular Reading Materials Publishing House notified us that it would be postponed to March 20. March 20 passed, and they notified us again that it would be launched on April 20. April 20 has passed again, and they have notified us that it will be launched on May 20.

    Furthermore, the third issue of "Chinese Women" should have been published on March 1. In order to cooperate with the "March 8" Women's Day, post offices in various regions requested an additional 300,000 copies for retail. The "March 8" Women's Day passed, but the magazine was not completely printed, resulting in a delay of thirteen days. There are many other similar situations in other magazines, which are difficult to list one by one.

    Changing the backward situation of slow magazine publication and distribution is the eager demand of readers, and we often receive letters in this regard. The readers who write letters include the Korean People's Volunteers who are far away from their motherland, border guards, workers, farmers, students, cadres of state organs, and surveyors scattered all over the country. Some readers are very angry because they have written several letters and the problem has not been resolved. For example, Li Ye and An Pei, two comrades from the Second Engineering Company of Xi'an, reflected: "'China Youth' is published on the 16th, and it will not reach the hands of the youth in Xi'an until the 21st.... The transportation between Xi'an and Beijing is quite convenient. It's still so late to see 'China Youth'. When will the youth in the border areas be able to see their own publications? We are appealing not only for ourselves, but also for more comrades in the distance…." Readers in Guangzhou, because they did not receive the third issue of "Chinese Women" after the "March 8" Women's Day, questioned us whether the magazine was transported by train or by ox cart. The Liangxiang Post Office reflected: "Readers have a lot of opinions about us because they cannot receive the magazines on time, and some have already requested a refund." Yuan Kexin from Hechi County Middle School in Guangxi wrote: "'China Youth Daily' and 'Middle School Students' are both published in Beijing. 'China Youth Daily' can arrive here three days after publication. Why does it take at least ten days for 'Middle School Students'? Does 'China Youth Daily' have wings to fly?..." All the members of Dormitory 137, Nankai University, Tianjin, because they did not receive "China Youth," which should have been published on February 16, until February 22, raised an opinion saying: "How much we need spiritual food! But it (referring to "China Youth") is slower than a bound-foot woman. If it takes a week to transport 'China Youth' from Beijing to Tianjin, then wouldn't people living in Urumqi have to wait until 1957 to see the 1956 magazine?" Every day, many similar letters are sent to our bureau and various newspapers and magazines. We believe that this is the voice of the people, and relevant departments should pay attention to it.

    The failure of magazines to be published on schedule causes many difficulties for post office delivery personnel, distribution personnel, and social newspaper and magazine promoters, which dampens their enthusiasm. As a result, many people are not at ease doing this work. At the same time, it also seriously affects the subscription and retail work of magazines. Because the business personnel, delivery personnel, and distributors of post offices in various regions do not understand the reasons for the delay, they cannot explain it to the readers. They can only apologize and say good things, and ask the readers to wait patiently. The director of the Liangxiang Post Office in Hebei came to Beijing in person to ask us to help solve the problem because he could not cope with the readers' accusations. He said: "Because the magazines are not published on time, the delivery personnel are afraid to meet the readers every day when they go out on duty, and they are afraid that they will not be able to answer the readers' opinions. Some readers even suspect that the delivery personnel are embezzling, which puts a lot of mental burden on the delivery personnel. This not only affects the work of the post office, but also seriously affects the quarterly subscription of magazines…." A letter from Tieshan Post Office in Zibo, Shandong said: "Due to the delayed publication of magazines, the promotion and subscription work of publications has been greatly hampered. Facts have proved that the number of magazine subscriptions in the second quarter has decreased by 15% compared with the first quarter…." Wang Kui, a mail clerk at the Third Hospital of Shilipu, Baoji City, helped comrades subscribe to newspapers and magazines on their behalf. Because the magazines were received late, he wrote to reflect: "Many comrades have asked me to return the money for subscribing to the publications, and they want me to answer why they cannot receive the magazines they subscribed to. Dear responsible comrades, please give them an answer! It is really difficult for me to answer, because the comrades' inquiries and dissatisfaction with me are justified. But I feel that it is unreasonable for me to suffer this anger alone, because this is not my responsibility." The third issue of "Chinese Women" and the fifth issue of "Current Affairs Handbook" were delayed for too long, and many post offices received them too late, making it difficult to sell them and requesting returns, which also caused economic losses to the country.

    The above situation shows that the late publication of magazines has seriously affected the political life of the vast number of readers. Although the situation of late publication is so serious, some publishing houses and editorial departments only forward the letters from readers reflecting that they cannot receive the magazines on time, without paying attention to them and improving their work. For example, the Travelers Magazine received many letters from readers reflecting that they could not see the first and second issues of "Travelers" in time, and they were all forwarded to us; in fact, it was because the first issue of "Travelers" was delayed by five days, the second issue was delayed by nine days, and the third issue was delayed by seven days, that the readers could not receive them. Other magazine publishers also have this situation.

    The situation of delayed magazine publication should be changed immediately. It is recommended that relevant leading organs take some specific measures to help and urge various publishing houses to improve their work and solve this problem. While improving the publishing work, the post office should also improve the delivery work and eliminate the shortcomings of backlog and untimely delivery.

### 为什么很多杂志不能按期出版

    为什么很多杂志不能按期出版编辑同志：
    我是北京邮局的一个工作人员，负责报纸杂志的发行工作。我要向你们反映一个情况：北京出版的很多杂志不能按期出版，已经引起了读者的严重不满。
    杂志不能按规定日期出版是出版工作长期没有解决的一个严重问题。如1955年3月份应该出版的154期杂志中，有83.12％延期出版；按册数计算有62.08％没能按时出版。文化部出版事业管理局当时重视了这个问题，对延期出版的杂志进行了检查，四月份情况就有了很大变化。这个月应该出版的143期杂志中，延期出版的就只有53.85％；按册数计算，延期出版的只有23.37％。但是，由于对杂志社的要求不严格，几个月之后情况就愈来愈加严重了。至今年三月份延期出版的期数达到72.63％，延期出版的册数达到了61.81％。
    杂志延期出版的情况以青年、通俗、美术、外文等出版社和中国妇女社为最突出。如中国青年出版社出版的七种杂志，1956年一至三月共出版二十七期，只有一期是按期出版的，延期总天数竟达163天，“中国青年”和“中学生”平均每期延期六、七天，“文艺学习”平均每期延期出版九天。又如通俗读物出版社出版的“时事手册”时间性虽然很强，但也经常延期出版，1956年第五期就延期到第六期以后出版，比原规定的出版日期延迟了二十一天；“农村工作通讯”原定在二月二十日创刊，到时间通俗读物出版社通知我们说要延期到三月二十日创刊，三月二十日过去了又通知我们四月二十日创刊，四月二十日又过去了，他们却又通知我们要在五月二十日创刊了。
    再如“中国妇女”第三期应该在三月一日出版，为了配合“三八”妇女节，各地邮局增要了三十多万份准备零售；“三八”妇女节过去了，杂志却还没有全部印出来，结果拖延了十三天。其它杂志类似情况也还不少，实难一一列举。
    改变杂志出版发行迟缓的落后状况是读者的殷切要求，我们经常收到这方面的来信。来信的读者有远离祖国的朝鲜人民志愿军，有边防战士，有工人、农民、学生和机关干部，也有散布祖国各地的勘察工作者。有些读者因为接连来过几次信而问题得不到解决，非常气愤。如西安第二工程公司李晔、安培两同志反映：“‘中国青年’在十六日出刊，到二十一日才能到达西安市青年的手里……。西安和北京之间交通相当方便，看到‘中国青年’还那末晚；边疆的青年将什么时候才能看到自己的刊物呢？我们不仅为了自己，并为更多远方的同志呼吁……。”广州读者因为过了“三八”妇女节收不到第三期的“中国妇女”，就责问我们运杂志是用火车还是用牛车。良乡邮局反映：“读者因为不能按时收到杂志，对我们有很大意见，有的已经要求退款。”广西河池县中学袁克信来信说：“‘中国青年报’和‘中学生’都是在北京出版的，‘中国青年报’在出版三天后就可以到我们这里了，为什么‘中学生’却至少要十天呢？难道‘中国青年报’有翅膀飞吗？……”天津南开大学第七宿舍137号全体人员因为二月二十二日才收到应在二月十六日出版的“中国青年”，就提出意见说：“我们是多么需要精神食粮呀！可是它（指‘中国青年’）比小脚女人来得更慢些。如果把‘中国青年’由北京运到天津需要一个星期的时间，那么住在乌鲁木齐岂不要到1957年才能看着1956年的杂志了吗？”每天有许多许多类似的信件寄到我局和各报社、杂志社，我们认为这是人民的呼声，有关部门应该重视。
    杂志不按期出版，给邮局投递人员、发行人员和社会报刊推广员造成很多困难，打击了他们的积极性，因而很多人不安心做这个工作；同时，也严重影响了杂志的收订和零售工作。各地邮局营业员、投递员、发行员因不了解延期原因，无法对读者解释，只有道歉讲好话，请读者耐心等待。河北良乡邮局局长，因为没法应付读者的责难，亲自来北京要求我们协助解决，他说：“因为杂志不按时出版，投递员每天出班害怕和读者见面，害怕读者提出意见后无法对答。有的读者甚至怀疑投递员贪污，使投递人员精神负担很大。这不仅影响邮局的工作，同时也严重影响了杂志的季度收订……。”山东淄博铁山邮局来信说：“由于杂志延期出版，大大妨碍了刊物推广和收订工作。事实证明，杂志收订数量在第二季度比第一季度下降15％……。宝鸡市十里铺第三医院收发王奎同志帮助同志们代订了报刊，因为杂志收到迟，就来信反映：“有很多同志要求我退回订刊物的钱，并且要我答复为什么订了杂志收不到的道理。敬爱的负责同志，请您给他们答复吧！我实在难以回答，因为同志们对我的询问和不满是应该的。但是我感到让我一人受这股气实在太不合情理了，因为这不是我的责任。”“中国妇女”第三期、“时事手册”第五期延期过久，很多邮局收到过迟，销售困难，要求退货，这也给国家在经济上造成损失。
    上述情况说明，杂志延期出版，已经严重影响了广大读者的政治生活。延期出版的情况虽然这样严重，但是有的出版社和编辑部接到读者反映不能按时收到杂志的信，只会转一转，没有引起重视和改进工作。如旅行家杂志社接到很多读者反映不能及时看到第一期和第二期“旅行家”的来信，都转给了我们；实际上是因为“旅行家”第一期延期出版五天，第二期延期出版九天，第三期延期出版七天，读者才收不到。其他杂志社也有这种情况。
    杂志延期出版的情况应该立即改变，建议有关领导机关采取一些具体措施帮助和督促各出版社改进工作，解决这个问题。在改进出版工作的同时，邮局也应该改进投递工作，消灭积压和投送不及时的缺点。
