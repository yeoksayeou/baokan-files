Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, May 25th: According to TASS, "Borba" published a statement by the President of the Yugoslav Federal National Assembly, Piaget, regarding the significance of the exchange of parliamentary delegations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. He said that after the exchange of delegations between the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the Federal National Assembly of Yugoslavia, the work of exchanging parliamentary delegations with the Eastern European People's Democratic countries also began. This kind of contact is absolutely beneficial and necessary for enhancing mutual understanding.

Of course, one cannot expect to gain a comprehensive and deep understanding from these visits. Therefore, much more work must be done: establishing the broadest contacts, sending people to study various aspects of each other's lives and individual major issues in greater depth. The press should also promote this.

    皮雅杰谈南斯拉夫
    同苏联和东欧国家的联系
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社贝尔格莱德二十五日讯：“战斗报”刊载了南斯拉夫联邦国民议会主席皮雅杰关于南斯拉夫同苏联和人民民主国家互派议会代表团的意义这个问题所发表的谈话。他说，在苏联最高苏维埃和南斯拉夫联邦国民议会互派代表团之后，我们同东欧人民民主国家交换议会代表团的工作也开始了。这种接触对于增进相互认识是绝对有益和必要的。
    自然，不能期望从这些访问中得到全面和深刻的认识。因此，还必须做许多工作：建立最广泛的接触，互相派人更加深刻地研究对方生活的各个方面和个别的重大问题。报刊也应当促进这件事。
