Fault-ridden Vacuum Brick Making Machine

To the Editor:

    Our Beijing Brick and Tile Factory ordered a vacuum brick making machine from the Tianjin No. 1 Machine Factory. This vacuum brick making machine has been constantly experiencing problems during the trial run: the chain in the vacuum chamber breaks as soon as it starts, and the mud pressing roller head is also cracked; the gear hardness is insufficient, and it wears out badly after a short period of use; the clutch engagement surface is uneven, and the spring plate is too loose, so it does not function as a clutch at all. As a result, the machine has a very high downtime rate.

    After joint assessment, the unanimous opinion is that the machine has design problems, poor material quality, and is roughly processed. We asked the Tianjin No. 1 Machine Factory to send someone to repair it. We have made several phone calls, and they have promised to send someone, but they have been delaying it for a long time. This has seriously affected our production. The Tianjin No. 1 Machine Factory should be responsible for the quality of its products and quickly come to repair this fault-ridden vacuum brick making machine.

    毛病百出的真空制砖机编辑同志：
    我们北京市砖瓦厂向天津市第一机器厂订制了一台真空制砖机。这台真空制砖机在试车过程中不断发生问题：真空室的链子一开车就断了，压泥滚轴头也破裂了；牙轮硬度不够，用了不久就磨损得很厉害；离合器接合面不平，弹簧片太松，根本不起离合作用。因此，使用这台机器的时候，停车率很高。
    经过双方鉴定，一致的意见是这台机器设计有问题，材料质量不好，加工粗糙。我们就请天津市第一机器厂派人来检修。电话打了好几次，他们也答应了，就是长期拖延不派人来。这已经严重地影响了我们生产。天津市第一机器厂应该对自己产品的质量负责，赶快来修理这台毛病百出的真空制砖机。
