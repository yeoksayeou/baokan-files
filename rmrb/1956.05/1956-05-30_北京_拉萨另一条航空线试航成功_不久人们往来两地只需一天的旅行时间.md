Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 29th. Xinhua News Agency reporter Lin Yin reports: Following the successful trial flight of the lead transport plane from Beijing to Lhasa, today the first well-equipped, comfortable passenger plane landed safely at the airport near Lhasa. Another air route from Beijing to Lhasa has also successfully completed its trial flight.

At around 10 a.m., when the silver-gray aircraft named "Beijing" appeared over Lhasa, people of all ethnic groups in Lhasa enthusiastically came out to watch. Representatives of the Tibetan local government, Taiji Gaxueba Qekyi Nyima, and representatives of the Panchen Kampot Conference Hall Committee, Xiangji Sonam Dorje, and others, went to the airport to welcome them and visited the "Beijing" aircraft cabin.

The "Beijing" flew for more than eleven hours from Beijing to Lhasa. It maintained an altitude of about 7,000 meters throughout the approximately 3,000-kilometer route. When encountering high-altitude winds of 120 kilometers per hour, it still moved forward at a speed of 300 kilometers per hour against the wind. The plane flew for a long time over the Kangzang Plateau. From the plane, one could clearly see that countless peaks of the Qionglai Mountains, Zhedo Mountains, and Tanggula Mountains were covered with snow. The Kangzang Highway was like a very long ribbon tied around the mountainside. On both sides of the famous turbulent Dadu River, like a silver chain, and the light green Jinsha River, primeval forests stretched for hundreds of kilometers. Sometimes, the clouds on the mountains were very thick, and the plane flew over the boundless sea of silver.

Traveling to Lhasa with the "Beijing" were staff members from the Ministry of Forestry, who were conducting aerial surveys and photography of forest resources on the Tibetan Plateau for the first time, as well as staff members from the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio and Xinhua News Agency reporters. The "Beijing" flew very smoothly, and the oxygen equipment was also very good. Passengers along the way breathed freely and were able to walk around, write, and take pictures in the cabin.

Based on the experience of this successful trial flight, relevant departments will soon officially open passenger and cargo transportation services between Beijing and Lhasa. In the future, people will only need one day of travel time between Beijing and Lhasa, and many precision instruments, valuable medicines, and other goods can also be airlifted to Lhasa.

The "Beijing" aircraft, which undertook this trial flight mission, was flown back to Beijing from Hong Kong in 1949 by the pilot Pan Guoding, who had revolted. Pan Guoding has been commended twice for his meritorious service since returning to China. He made great contributions to the success of this trial flight with his skilled flying techniques and rich experience.

### 北京—拉萨另一条航空线试航成功  不久人们往来两地只需一天的旅行时间

    北京—拉萨另一条航空线试航成功
    不久人们往来两地只需一天的旅行时间
    新华社拉萨29日电　新华社记者林印报道：继领队运输机从北京到拉萨试航成功后，今天第一架设备良好的、舒适的旅客机，在拉萨附近的机场上安全降落。从北京通往拉萨的另一条航线也试航成功了。
    上午十时许，当这架名为“北京号”的银灰色飞机出现在拉萨上空时，拉萨市各族人民都热情地纷纷赶出来观看。西藏地方政府代表台吉噶雪巴·却吉尼玛和班禅堪布会议厅委员会的代表香吉·索南多杰等人，都到机场欢迎，并进入“北京号”机舱内参观。
    “北京号”自北京到拉萨一共飞行了十一个多小时。它在约三千公里的航线上，一直保持着七千公尺左右的高空飞行。在遇到风速每小时一百二十公里的高空风时，仍以每小时三百公里的速度顶风前进。飞机长时间地在康藏高原的上空飞行，在飞机上，可以清楚地看见邛崃山脉、折多山脉和唐古拉山脉的无数山峰上，尽是积雪；康藏公路像一条极长的彩带束在山腰；在像银链样地著名湍急的大渡河和淡绿色的金沙江两岸，原始森林绵延几百公里长。有时候，山上积云很浓，飞机就在那一望无际的银海上面飞过。
    随“北京号”到达拉萨的，有林业部的工作人员，他们是第一次从空中对西藏高原的森林资源进行调查和摄影，还有中央新闻纪录电影制片厂的工作人员和新华社记者。“北京号”飞行很平稳，氧气设备也很好，沿途旅客呼吸自如，并且能在机舱内走动、写字和摄影。
    根据这次试航成功的经验，有关部门不久将正式开办北京—拉萨间旅客和货物运输营业。将来，人们往来于北京拉萨间只需要一天的旅行时间，许多精密仪器、贵重药品等货物，也都可以空运到拉萨。
    担任这次试航任务的“北京号”是1949年由起义的飞行员潘国定从香港驾驶回到北京的。潘国定回国后曾经两次立功。他以熟练的飞行技术和丰富的经验，对这次试航成功作了很大贡献。
