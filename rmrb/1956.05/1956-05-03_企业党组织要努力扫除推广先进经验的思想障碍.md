　　Enterprise Party Organizations Must Strive to Eliminate Ideological Obstacles to Promoting Advanced Experiences
　　Qimin
    In industrial and mining enterprises, in order to realize advanced production plans, not only do the administrative leaders of the enterprises need to do a lot of specific organizational leadership work, but the enterprise Party organizations must also continue to strengthen their political and ideological work and eliminate various ideological obstacles among Party members and the masses in order to ensure the comprehensive completion of the production plans. Otherwise, even if advanced and reliable production plans are formulated, they may fail.
    One of the political and ideological tasks that enterprise Party organizations need to strengthen is to assist the enterprise's administrative leaders in summarizing and promoting advanced experiences. In particular, it is necessary to do a good job in their own organizational and propaganda work. The Party organization of the Qingdao No. 3 State-owned Cotton Mill began to concentrate its main efforts in mid-January this year to publicize advanced individuals and advanced experiences inside and outside the factory on a large scale, and specifically organized all factory workers to study these advanced experiences. As a result, not only did it successfully complete the trial production of new products, but it also comprehensively overfulfilled the production plan for the first quarter. The Party organization of the First Engineering Company of Taiyuan Chemical Metallurgical Construction Company has also done a relatively good job in this regard. Before promoting advanced experiences, the general Party branch comprehensively understood the concerns and various erroneous thoughts of the workers and masses regarding the promotion of advanced experiences through individual activities of various branches and Party members, conducted serious analysis and research, and then mobilized all Party members and activists to carry out propaganda and explanation work in response to these concerns and erroneous thoughts. Members of the general Party branch and members of each branch conducted specific and patient propaganda work for key units and individuals. After such arduous and meticulous ideological education work, an upsurge of learning from advanced producers quickly developed. Therefore, the production outlook quickly changed, and the production plan for the first quarter was overfulfilled. In the process of promoting advanced experiences, 744 advanced producers and more than 40 advanced production units were also discovered and cultivated.
    However, at present, not all enterprise Party organization workers recognize the importance of summarizing and promoting advanced experiences, thereby strengthening propaganda and explanation work in this regard. There are also some enterprise Party organizations and administrative leaders who, like the administrative leaders, keep the summary and promotion of advanced experiences in meetings and resolutions, without carrying out specific organizational work and propaganda work. The Party committee of the Wuxi State-owned Diesel Engine Factory is a typical example. As early as the beginning of January this year, the Party committee of this factory began to mobilize the masses to formulate an advanced production plan that increased production by 136% compared to last year. After the plan was formulated, although the Party committee also held meetings and made resolutions to promote advanced experiences, and also designated someone to be responsible for this work. However, the Party committee no longer cared about what the Party members and the masses thought about promoting advanced experiences, and how advanced experiences should be promoted. As a result, not only were many advanced experiences of workers not promoted, but there was also a phenomenon of Party members restricting and attacking those who actively learned advanced experiences. For example, worker Zhu Jianqin of the machine shop mastered the high-speed cutting method in 1954, and had also performed it at the Wuxi Mechanical Workers' Advanced Experience Exchange Conference. Other mechanical factories in Wuxi also learned and promoted his experience, but in the diesel engine factory, he was the only one who used high-speed cutting until March this year. In February, inspired by the production upsurge, worker Chen Xugen was determined to learn how to use Zhu Jianqin's high-speed cutting method, but the administrative leader kept refusing to provide pulleys. Later, he found an old pulley in the scrap iron pile, processed and repaired it, and installed it on the machine tool, preparing to learn how to use the high-speed cutting method. After Communist Party member Yang Quanfa, the head of the power section, discovered this, he unreasonably obstructed it under the pretext of "non-standard" and "excessive waste." And the Party organization of this factory neither criticized the administrative leaders for their procrastination in promoting advanced experiences, nor did it take appropriate action against the Party member's erroneous behavior of openly suppressing workers' production enthusiasm. It is no wonder that the workers reflected: "The advanced experience of our factory is like a tall lamp, illuminating the distance but not the near." As a result, the factory only completed about 87% of its production plan in January and February this year.
    To ensure the comprehensive completion of the production plan, the enterprise Party organization must also promptly discover and criticize the complacency of some Party members. Now some Party members who hold leadership positions in enterprises, after the masses' enthusiasm for production rises, and after some new atmospheres appear in production, become arrogant, complacent, and blindly optimistic, as if they no longer need to do any work and can complete the plan from now on. In fact, the ever-developing new situation of industrial production raises many new problems, and if they are not properly resolved in a timely manner, the masses' enthusiasm for production may decline, and reasonable proposals may decrease, which may affect the comprehensive completion of the production plan. The lessons of the Nanjing Machine Tool Factory should arouse serious vigilance among enterprise Party organizations. After mobilizing the masses to formulate the production plan, the Party organization of this factory initially grasped the key issues in production, urged the administration to take various measures, and mobilized the workers to carry out labor competitions. As a result, new quotas were broken one after another, and the plans for January and February were overfulfilled. However, some leaders in the factory did not consolidate and continue to expand these achievements, but became blindly optimistic and abandoned their work, wrongly assuming: "There is no problem in completing the production plan. Even if there are difficulties in the future, as long as the Party makes a call and the masses are enthusiastic, they can all be overcome." As a result, a series of problems occurred in March: the seven technical measures newly proposed by the foundry shop were not implemented on time, the material supply work could not keep up, the office work began to show a "dragging back" phenomenon, and then batch scrapping quality accidents occurred in the foundry, tool, and metalworking shops, affecting the completion of the production plan in March. The situation in the Sixth Workshop of Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory is also the same. The Sixth Workshop was originally a backward workshop, and it failed to complete the state plan for five consecutive months in the second half of 1955. After the production upsurge was launched at the beginning of this year, the production plan was overfulfilled in January, and the quality of products was also greatly improved. However, later, due to the administrative leaders and Party organization cadres of the workshop developing a sense of complacency, they relaxed their specific leadership over production and political and ideological work before and after the Spring Festival. Therefore, in February, a large number of products were scrapped, and the production plan was not completed again. These facts tell us that in the current production upsurge, especially in enterprises where the production plan is completed relatively well, it is easiest to breed arrogance and complacency. The task of the enterprise Party organization is to be good at promptly discovering and criticizing this erroneous thinking, and to be good at exposing and stopping it when it is still in its infancy, and not let it continue to develop and harm production.
    In the current upsurge of industrial production, there are also some erroneous thoughts and practices that require enterprise Party organizations to pay attention to correcting. That is, some enterprise leaders regard the current socialist emulation movement as a "gust of wind" and a temporary "assault movement." Therefore, they use the workers' high production enthusiasm to arbitrarily work overtime, simply increasing the workers' labor intensity without paying attention to the workers' health and production safety. For example, individual leaders of the Civil Engineering and Repair Office of Anshan Iron and Steel Company ordered four workers who had been working continuously for sixteen hours to continue production in order to unilaterally catch up with the progress. In order to overfulfill the plan, the leaders of Yunnan Cigarette Factory not only let the workers work overtime on Sundays, but also used the workers' daily spare time for study to carry out assaults. This not only violates the country's labor protection law and the management principles of socialist enterprises, but will also ultimately cause losses to production. Because although some deeds of breaking quotas may temporarily appear in assault movements, and the production plan may be temporarily overfulfilled, work-related injuries and the rejection rate will inevitably increase greatly. After a long period of intense assaults, the workers will be exhausted, diseases will increase, their enthusiasm for production will decline, and the attendance rate will also decrease, and the enterprise's production may decline. Everyone knows that in our country, people are the most valuable wealth. Therefore, caring about the people's sufferings, especially caring about the sufferings of the working people, is the most fundamental policy of our Party and country. In order to protect the health of employees of industrial and mining enterprises and ensure safe production, the Party and the government have specifically formulated strict labor protection regulations, stipulating that all industrial and mining enterprises must not arbitrarily work overtime without the consent of the trade union. However, at present, not only have many enterprise administrative leaders forgotten this regulation, but the Party organizations and trade union organizations there also turn a blind eye to this phenomenon, without asking questions, and some Party organizations and trade union workers even "mobilize" and "encourage" workers to work overtime. This phenomenon of being divorced from the masses and disregarding the workers' sufferings must be stopped quickly.
    Only by strengthening its political and ideological work and promptly eliminating various ideological obstacles in the implementation of the national plan can the enterprise Party organization ensure the comprehensive completion of the enterprise production plan.

　　企业党组织要努力扫除推广先进经验的思想障碍
　　启民
    在工矿企业中，为了实现先进的生产计划，不但企业的行政领导需要做很多具体的组织领导工作，企业党组织也必须继续加强自己的政治思想工作，扫除党员和群众中的各种思想障碍，才能保证生产计划的全面完成。否则，即使制定了先进而可靠的生产计划，也可能落空。
    企业党组织需要加强的政治思想工作之一，就是要协助企业行政领导做好总结和推广先进经验的工作。特别是要做好自己的组织工作和宣传工作。国营青岛第三棉纺织厂党组织今年一月中旬开始集中主要力量，大张旗鼓地宣传了厂内外的先进人物和先进经验，并具体地组织全厂职工学习了这些先进经验。结果不但顺利地完成了新产品的试制任务，而且全面超额地完成了第一季度的生产计划。太原化学冶金建设公司第一工程公司党组织在这方面也作得比较好。在推广先进经验以前，党总支通过各个支部和党员的个别活动，全面了解了职工群众对推广先进经验的各种顾虑和各种错误思想，认真地进行了分析研究，然后发动全体党员和积极分子针对这些顾虑和错误思想展开宣传和解释工作。党总支委员和各个支部的委员对重点单位和个人进行具体耐心的宣传工作。经过这样的艰苦细致的思想教育工作之后，向先进生产者学习的热潮就迅速地开展起来。因此，生产面貌很快有了改变，第一季度的生产计划超额完成了。在推广先进经验的过程中，还发现和培养了七百四十四个先进生产者和四十多个先进生产单位。
    但是，目前并不是所有企业党组织的工作人员都认识了总结和推广先进经验的重要意义，从而加强这方面的宣传解释工作。还有一些企业党组织和行政领导一样，把总结和推广先进经验停留在会议上和决议上，并没有进行具体的组织工作和宣传工作。国营无锡柴油机厂党委会就是一个典型的例子。这个厂的党委会早在今年一月上旬就开始发动群众制定了比去年增产136％的先进的生产计划。在计划制定之后，党委会虽然也召开过会议，作出了推广先进经验的决议，而且还指定了专人负责这项工作。但是，究竟党员和群众对推广先进经验有些什么看法，先进经验应该怎样推广，党委会就不再管了。结果，不但工人中的许多先进经验没有推广，而且发生了党员限制和打击积极学习先进经验的现象。如机工车间工人朱健勤在1954年就掌握了高速切削法，还曾经在无锡机械工人先进经验交流会上表演过，无锡其他机械厂也都学习和推广了他的经验，而柴油机厂却直到今年三月还只有他一个人在进行高速切削。二月间，工人陈叙根在生产热潮的鼓舞下，一心要想学习使用朱健勤的高速切削法，行政领导却一直不供给皮带盘。后来他在废铁堆里找了一只旧皮带盘，把它加工修理后安在机床上，准备学习使用高速切削法，共产党员、动力科长杨全发发现后，却在“不合规格”和“浪费太大”的借口下无理加以阻挠。而这个厂的党组织既没有对行政领导迟迟不去推广先进经验的拖拉作风进行批评，也没有对党员这种公然压制工人生产积极性的错误行为进行适当处理。这就难怪工人们反映：“我厂先进经验是丈二高的大灯，照远不照近”。以致这个厂今年一、二月份的生产计划只完成87％左右。
    要保证全面地完成生产计划，企业党组织还要及时地发现和批判一些党员中的骄傲自满情绪。现在有些担任企业领导工作的党员，在群众的生产热情高涨起来之后，在生产上出现了一些新的气象之后，就骄傲自满和盲目乐观起来，好像再用不着再作什么工作，从此就可以完成计划。事实上，日益发展着的工业生产的新形势提出了许多新问题，如不及时地加以妥善的解决，群众的生产热情就可能下降，合理化建议可能减少，这样可能会影响生产计划的全面完成。国营南京机床厂的教训应当引起企业党组织的严重警惕。这个厂在发动群众制定生产计划之后，最初党组织紧紧抓住生产中的关键问题，督促行政采取各种措施，发动职工群众开展劳动竞赛，于是新定额纷纷被突破，一、二月份的计划都超额完成了。但是厂里的一些领导人员不是巩固和继续扩大这些成绩，而是盲目乐观起来，放弃了自己的工作，错误地设想：“完成生产计划没啥问题，就是将来有了困难，只要党来个号召，群众劲头一来，都能够克服。”结果三月份就发生了一连串的问题：铸工车间新提出的七项技术措施没有按时实现，材料供应工作跟不上去，科室工作开始出现了“拖后腿”的现象，接着铸工、工具和金工车间发生了成批报废的质量事故，影响了三月份生产计划的完成。沈阳重型机器厂第六车间的情况也是这样。六车间原来是一个落后车间，1955年下半年连续五个月没有完成国家计划。在今年年初掀起生产高潮后，一月份超额地完成了生产计划，产品质量也大为提高。但是后来由于该车间行政领导干部和党组织的干部滋长了一种自满情绪，放松了对生产的具体领导和春节前后的政治思想工作，因此二月份的产品大量报废，生产计划又没有完成。这些事实告诉我们：在目前的生产高潮中，特别是在生产计划完成得比较好的企业里，最容易滋长骄傲自满情绪。企业党组织的任务，就是要善于及时发现和批判这种错误思想，善于在它还处在萌芽状态的时候就加以揭发和制止，不要让它继续发展下去，危害生产。
    在目前工业生产高潮中，还有一种错误思想和错误作法，需要企业党组织注意纠正。这就是有些企业领导人员把当前的社会主义竞赛运动当成“一阵风”，当成临时性的“突击运动”。因而利用工人群众高涨的生产积极性任意加班加点，一味地提高工人的劳动强度，而不注意工人的身体健康和生产安全。如鞍山钢铁公司土建检修处的个别领导人员为了片面地赶进度，竟命令连续做了十六小时工作的四个工人继续进行生产。云南纸烟厂领导人员为了超额完成计划，不但让工人在星期天加班加点，还利用工人每天的业余学习时间进行突击。这样作不仅违背了国家的劳动保护法，违背了社会主义企业的经营管理原则，而且最终也会给生产造成损失。因为在突击运动中虽然可能暂时出现一些突破定额的事迹，也可能暂时超额完成生产计划，但是工伤事故和废品率必然会大大增加，工人们经过长期紧张的突击之后，精疲力竭，疾病增多，生产热情会减退，出勤率也会降低，企业生产可能走下坡路。谁都知道，在我们的国家里，人是最宝贵的财富。因此，关心人的疾苦特别是关心劳动人民的疾苦是我们党和国家的最根本的方针。党和政府为了保护工矿企业职工的健康，保证安全生产，专门制定了严格的劳动保护条例，规定所有工矿企业没有得到工会同意不得擅自加班加点。但是，目前不但许多企业行政领导者忘记了这项规定，而且那里的党组织和工会组织也对这种现象听之任之，不加过问，有的党组织和工会工作人员甚至还“动员”和“鼓励”工人去加班加点。这种脱离群众不顾工人疾苦的现象必须赶快停止。
    企业党组织只有加强自己的政治思想工作，及时地扫除执行国家计划中的各种各样思想障碍，才能保证企业生产计划的全面完成。
