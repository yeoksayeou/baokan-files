Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    The first "hydroelectric power boat," designed and manufactured by the Shandong Province Department of Transportation, was successfully tested at the Luokou Ferry on the Yellow River on the 29th. The designed capacity of the power generation equipment on this "hydroelectric power boat" is 10 kilowatts, but its power generation capacity can reach up to 15 kilowatts. It only requires one person to operate. It can produce electricity worth 120,000 yuan annually, while the cost of power generation is only over 3,000 yuan.

    This "hydroelectric power boat" can supply electricity for dock loading and unloading machines and lighting, electric ferries, and navigation marker lights. It can also supply electricity for farmland irrigation and rural lighting along the river, as well as for small machinery. It can move with the water to any place where electricity is needed. Its structure is simple, with the main components being two crankshafts, three tie rods, and several vane plates.

    After the successful trial of the "hydroelectric power boat," Wang Liang, Deputy Director of the Provincial Department of Transportation, told Xinhua News Agency reporters: In the future, the Shandong Provincial Department of Transportation will mass-produce this type of "hydroelectric power boat" so that all ferries on the Yellow River will have electric ferries, electric loading and unloading machines, and electric lights.

    黄河渡口上的“水力发电船”
    山东省交通厅设计、制造的第一艘“水力发电船”，二十九日在黄河洛口渡口试验成功。这艘“水力发电船”的发电设备的设计能力为十瓩，但是它的发电能力最高可以达到十五瓩。它只需要一个人操纵。每年能生产出价值十二万元的电力；发电成本只需要三千多元。
    这种“水力发电船”，可以供应码头装卸机和照明用电、电动渡轮和航标电灯用电；也可以供应沿河农田灌溉和农村照明、小型机具用电。它可以随水流动到任何需用电力的地方去。它的构造简单，主要机件为两根曲轴、三根拉杆和数块叶板。
    省交通厅副厅长王亮在“水力发电船”试验成功以后对新华社记者说：今后山东省交通厅要大批生产这种“水力发电船”，使黄河上所有的渡口都有电动渡轮、电力装卸机和电灯。
