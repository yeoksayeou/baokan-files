Xinhua News Agency, May 11th, TASS, Paris, May 10th: The French Foreign Ministry issued a communiqué regarding the documents of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on the Vietnam issue.

The French Foreign Ministry noted with satisfaction that these documents reflect the belief that the Vietnam Armistice Agreement will remain in effect until a general election is held in Vietnam to unify Vietnam, and stated: "It is hoped that the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam will be able to continue its activities. As for the French government, it has decided to work with other relevant parties to realize the wishes expressed by the two chairmen. Although France no longer bears special responsibility due to the dissolution of the French Federation General Command in Vietnam, in reality France cannot but be concerned about the agreements it has signed. Therefore, France is prepared to carry out the mediation work required of it."

    法国外交部发表公报
    支持日内瓦会议两位主席的愿望
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社巴黎十日讯：法国外交部就日内瓦会议两位主席关于越南问题的文件发表公报。
    法国外交部满意地指出，在这些文件中反映了这样的信念：越南停战协定在越南没有进行统一越南的普选以前将继续生效，并且声明：“可以希望：越南国际监督和监察委员会将能继续自己的活动。至于法国政府，它决定同其他有关方面共同努力来使两位主席所表示的愿望得以实现。虽然由于在越南的法兰西联邦总司令部已经撤销，法国不再负有特别的责任，然而实际上法国不能不关心它所签订的协定。因此，法国准备执行要求它所做的斡旋工作。”
