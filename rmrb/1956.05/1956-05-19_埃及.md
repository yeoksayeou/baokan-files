Egypt

Egypt is an ancient civilization located in northeastern Africa. Its territory includes the fertile Nile River valley in Africa and the Sinai Peninsula in Asia. Approximately 22 million Egyptian people inhabit the nation's land area of about one million square kilometers. Among them, 90% adhere to Islam. The capital of Egypt is Cairo, and the main port is Alexandria.

Egypt was once one of the world's great powers in ancient times. It has a long history of over six thousand years and created a glorious ancient culture. Egyptians made outstanding contributions in science fields such as mathematics and astronomy. The pyramids, the Sphinx, and other architectural arts of Egypt still amaze people today. However, for hundreds of years, Egypt suffered from foreign invasions. In the sixteenth century, the Turks conquered it; at the end of the eighteenth century, French troops ravaged it; from the end of the nineteenth century, Britain occupied it and unilaterally declared Egypt as a British protectorate.

Egypt has rich mineral resources underground. Oil is abundant along the Red Sea coast and the Sinai Peninsula, the Aswan region has iron ore, and high-quality phosphate rock is found along the Red Sea coast and the Libyan Desert.

Economically, Egypt is an agricultural country. The agricultural population accounts for 80% of the total population. Historically, it was once known as the granary of the Mediterranean. However, as a result of long-term colonial oppression, Egypt has become a country specializing in the production of cotton. Cotton fields account for about one-third of the cultivated land area. Nearly half of the total agricultural income comes from cotton. Cotton is the country's main export item, with nearly 90% of cotton being exported abroad. The main grain crops are wheat, corn, rice, and barley.

In addition to some textiles and mining, Egypt's industry mainly consists of the initial processing of agricultural products. However, most enterprises are semi-handicraft and small-handicraft factories. Foreign capital, mainly British capital, still occupies an important position in Egyptian enterprises. In 1948, foreign capital accounted for about 60% of the total investment in Egypt. According to the "Egyptian Gazette" of August 12, 1954, by the end of 1953, the ratio of foreign capital to Egyptian capital was about eight to two.

The colonialists' cruel exploitation and oppression of the Egyptian people aroused a long and heroic struggle by the Egyptian people against colonial oppression and for national independence. In 1936, Britain and Egypt signed an unequal treaty in London, stipulating that British troops would continue to be stationed on Egyptian territory, and nominally recognizing Egyptian independence. After World War II, the Egyptian people's movement for national independence surged even higher. In October 1951, under popular pressure, the Egyptian Parliament approved a decree abolishing the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. In October 1954, Britain and Egypt signed the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement on the British military base in the Suez Canal Zone, stipulating the complete withdrawal of the British occupation forces from the Suez Canal Zone within twenty months. On April 14 this year, the Egyptian government announced that the last batch of British troops had withdrawn from the Suez Canal Zone.

Egypt was originally a monarchy. In July 1952, a revolution took place in Egypt, expelling King Farouk, confiscating the large estates of the court group, abolishing social classes and noble titles, and cleansing the corrupt national institutions. After a period of time, on September 18, 1953, the Egyptian government announced the permanent abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of the Arab Republic of Egypt.

On January 16 this year, Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser announced Egypt's new constitution. According to the provisions of the new constitution: Egypt is an independent Arab state. The political system is a republic. Egyptians are part of the Arab nation. The state religion is Islam, and Arabic is the official national language. The constitution also stipulates that the head of state is the president, usually nominated by the National Assembly and elected by national referendum for a term of six years. This constitution will take effect after being approved by a national referendum to be held on June 23 this year, and presidential elections will be held at the same time.

Among the measures taken by the Egyptian Republic government in recent years, the land reform law promulgated in September 1952 must be mentioned. This decree stipulates that the government uses compensation methods to confiscate land exceeding 84 hectares from landlords, and uses installment methods to distribute land to farmers, and makes certain restrictions and reductions on land rents. In addition, the Egyptian government has also formulated a program to improve agriculture, planning to build a dam on the Nile River at Aswan. After this dam is completed, it can expand the cultivated land area by two million acres.

Now the Egyptian authorities have formulated a plan to develop the desert, establishing a vast and fertile new province in the Libyan Desert adjacent to the southwest of the Nile Delta. This province is decided to be called "Liberation Province." More than four hundred villages will be built on this land.

The Egyptian government has also taken some measures on the road to industrialization. The Ministry of Industrial Production Affairs was established, which is responsible for planning national industrial production. Plans for the construction of power stations have begun. Among the enterprises to be built are steel mills, iron mills, fertilizer plants, paper mills, sugar mills, tire factories, and flax textile factories.

Before 1953, Egypt's foreign trade balance was often in deficit. In recent years, this deficit has improved. The Egyptian government has made many efforts in this regard in order to free its economy from foreign control. At the end of 1953, Egypt sent a trade delegation to the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries to visit and negotiate trade issues. In 1954, Egypt signed trade agreements with the Soviet Union, Romania, and the German Democratic Republic. In August 1955, Egypt and China signed a trade agreement. China has purchased 91,000 bales of Egyptian cotton, and Egypt has imported 60,000 tons of steel from China. Recently, during the visit of the Chinese trade delegation to Egypt, China and Egypt reached a transaction of 4 million pounds.

In its foreign policy, the Egyptian government advocates promoting international peace and cooperation. On July 24, 1954, Prime Minister Nasser announced the Egyptian government's foreign policy at a foreign press conference. He said: "Egypt is willing to coexist peacefully with all countries and is ready to cooperate with all those who truly wish to cooperate."

Egypt participated in the Asian-African Conference, which has great historical significance, and is making active efforts to implement the resolutions of this conference.

Egypt refuses to participate in the military aggression groups pieced together by Western countries in the Middle East. Prime Minister Nasser has said that such military groups are a new form of colonialism. The Egyptian people, together with other Arab countries, are fighting against this colonialist aggression.

Because Egypt pursues an independent and autonomous foreign policy, Egypt's international status is increasing day by day. Today's Egypt is no longer a colony that cannot control its own destiny, but an independent country that plays an active role in international affairs.

    埃及
    埃及是一个文明古国，位于非洲东北部。它的领土包括非洲肥沃的尼罗河流域和亚洲的西奈半岛。在全国面积约一百万平方公里的土地上，居住着约二千二百万埃及人民。其中90％信奉伊斯兰教。埃及首都是开罗，主要港口是亚力山大港。
    埃及在古代曾是世界强国之一。它有着六千多年的悠久历史，创造了光辉灿烂的古代文化。埃及人在数学、天文学等科学方面，都作了卓越的贡献。埃及的金字塔、狮身人面像和其他建筑艺术至今犹令人惊叹。但是，数百年来，埃及遭受了外国的侵略。十六世纪时土耳其人征服过它；十八世纪末，法国军队蹂躏过它；从十九世纪末期起，英国就占领了它，并片面地把埃及宣布为英国的保护国。
    埃及的地下有丰富的矿藏。红海沿岸和西奈半岛盛产石油，阿斯旺区有铁矿，红海沿岸和利比亚沙漠有优质的磷灰岩。
    埃及在经济方面是一个农业国。农业人口占全国总人口的80％。在历史上，它曾经被称为地中海的粮仓。但是，由于长期遭受殖民压迫的结果，使埃及成了专门生产棉花的国家。棉田约占耕地面积的三分之一。在农业的总收入中差不多有一半是从棉花得到的。棉花是国家的主要出口项目，近约90％的棉花都要输往国外。主要的谷类作物是小麦、玉蜀黍、稻米、大麦等。
    埃及的工业，除了一些纺织业和采矿业之外，主要是农产品的初步加工工业。但大部分的企业都是半手工业和小手工业的工厂。外国资本，主要是英国资本，在埃及的企业中仍占着重要地位。1948年外国资本约占埃及投资总额的60％左右。据1954年8月12日“埃及公报”载称，至1953年年底止，外国资本与埃及资本约为八与二之比。
    由于殖民者对埃及人民的残酷剥削和压迫，激起了埃及人民长期英勇地进行了反对殖民压迫和争取民族独立的斗争。1936年，英国和埃及在伦敦签订了不平等条约，规定英国军队继续驻扎在埃及的领土上，并在字面上承认了埃及独立。第二次世界大战以后，埃及人民争取民族独立的运动更加高涨，1951年10月，埃及议会在人民的压力下批准了废除英埃条约的法令。1954年10月英埃签订了英埃关于苏彝士运河区英国军事基地的协定，规定在二十个月内完全撤出苏彝士运河区的英国占领军。今年四月十四日，埃及政府宣布，最后一批英国军队已撤离苏彝士运河区。
    埃及原是一个君主政体的国家。1952年7月埃及发生革命，驱逐了国王法鲁克，没收了宫廷集团的大地产，废除了社会等级和贵族称号，清洗了贪污腐败的国家机构。经过了一段时期后，在1953年9月18日，埃及政府就宣布永远废除君主政体，成立了埃及共和国。
    今年一月十六日，埃及总理纳赛尔宣布了埃及的新宪法。根据新宪法的规定：埃及是一个独立的阿拉伯国家。政体是共和政体。埃及人是阿拉伯民族的一部分。国教是伊斯兰教，而阿拉伯文是正式的国家语文。宪法并规定：国家元首是总统，通常由国民议会提名、由全国公民投票选举产生，任期六年。这个宪法将在今年六月二十三日举行的全民投票批准后生效，同时将举行总统的选举。
    在埃及共和国政府近几年来所采取的措施中，不能不提到1952年9月所颁布的土地改革法。这项法令规定，政府用补偿的办法来没收地主超过八十四公顷的土地，而用分期收费的办法把土地分配给农民，并对地租作了一定程度的限制和减低。此外埃及政府还制定了提高农业的纲领，计划在尼罗河上的阿斯旺修个水坝，这个水坝修好后能使耕地面积扩大二百万英亩。
    现在埃及当局已拟定了一个开发沙漠的计划，在毗连尼罗河三角洲西南方的利皮亚沙漠建立一个幅员广阔、土地肥沃的新省，这个省决定叫作“解放省”。在这片土地上将要建立四百多个村庄。
    埃及政府在工业化的道路上也采取了一些措施。成立了工业生产事务部，由它来负责计划全国范围内的工业生产，建设发电站的计划已开始进行。在决定将建设的企业中，有炼钢厂、炼铁厂、人造肥料工厂、造纸厂、制糖厂、轮胎厂以及麻纺织厂等工厂。
    1953年以前埃及的对外贸易差额经常是逆差。近年以来这种差额已有了改善。埃及政府为了使自己的经济摆脱外国的控制，曾在这方面作了许多的努力。1953年年底，埃及派遣了一个贸易代表团到苏联及人民民主国家访问并谈判进行贸易的问题。1954年内埃及和苏联、罗马尼亚、德意志民主共和国签订了贸易协定，1955年8月埃及和中国签订了贸易协定。中国先后购买了九万一千包埃及棉花，埃及从中国输入了六万吨钢材。最近，我国贸易访问团在埃及期间，中埃双方又达成了四百万英镑金额的交易。
    埃及政府在外交政策上，主张促进国际间的和平与合作。1954年7月24日，纳赛尔总理在外国记者招待会上宣布过埃及政府的外交政策，他说：“埃及愿和一切国家和平共处，准备和一切真正希望合作的人进行合作。”
    埃及参加了具有伟大历史意义的亚非会议，并为了执行这个会议的决议作着积极的努力。
    埃及拒绝参加西方国家在中东地区所拼凑的军事侵略集团，纳赛尔总理说过，这种军事集团是殖民主义的新形式。埃及人民同其他阿拉伯国家一起，正为反对这种殖民主义侵略而斗争。
    由于埃及奉行了独立自主的外交政策，埃及的国际地位日益提高。今天的埃及已不再是一个不能掌握自己命运的殖民地，而是在国际事务中起着积极作用的独立国了。    （陈汝厚）（附图片）
