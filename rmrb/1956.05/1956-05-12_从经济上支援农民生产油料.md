It is now the season for spring-sown oil crops. Preparations for summer-sown oil crops have also begun. Farmers and rural workers in various regions are actively working to achieve the country's oil crop production increase plan, which is a good phenomenon. All economic departments, including grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives, should actively support farmers economically and help them complete their planting tasks.

Many farmers in various regions have reported a shortage of peanut seeds. Without seeds, planting is impossible, which is a very serious problem. The most effective way to solve this problem is to implement adjustments between cooperatives and between adjacent regions. However, newly developed oil crop producing areas and regions with expanded planting areas cannot completely solve the problem solely through on-site adjustments. The grain departments' oil companies should cooperate with agricultural departments to be responsible for supplying the seeds needed by these regions. The supply of seeds should not only be timely but also guarantee quality. This spring, the peanut seeds supplied to farmers in some areas of Guangdong had an 80% failure rate in germination. All regions should learn from this lesson.

In recent years, grain supplies in some concentrated oil crop producing areas have been insufficient. This is an important factor affecting farmers' enthusiasm for planting oil crops. Just think, if people who plant peanuts and soybeans cannot get enough grain, who would be willing to plant peanuts and soybeans? The grain departments in concentrated oil crop producing areas should, in accordance with the spirit of rewarding the planting of oil crops, give appropriate preferential treatment and consideration to farmers who plant oil crops in terms of grain purchase and sales. They should formulate a practical grain supply method and inform the farmers of this method to dispel their concerns about not having enough grain if they plant too many oil crops. Some farmers in concentrated oil crop producing areas have already started eating soybeans because of insufficient grain. The grain departments should quickly allocate the necessary grain to them.

This year, the state will increase the purchase prices of certain oil crops, such as soybeans and sesame. This will enable farmers who plant oil crops to obtain more income. All departments that purchase oil crops should announce the new prices as soon as possible to encourage farmers' enthusiasm for planting oil crops, plant according to plan, and strive to increase yields per unit area.

The state's policy for the unified purchase of oil crops is "more production, more gain; increased production, more retention." According to this policy, the state leaves farmers who produce oil crops with oil crops that meet quantitative standards and the necessary seeds, and then purchases them in proportion to the marketable quantity. In this way, farmers who produce more oil crops can obtain more oil crops. This method has been implemented since last year, but many farmers are not yet familiar with it. The oil crop unified purchase tasks for this year have been largely determined, and various regions should promptly transmit the specific figures down level by level, all the way to the cooperatives and members, so that farmers know how much the state will purchase this year and how much they can keep for themselves. In this way, they can plan their oil crop production work for this year.

The output of oil crops in our country is increasing year by year, but the state-stipulated planting area and output plans have not been completed. Providing farmers with strong economic support is an effective way to ensure the completion of planting plans and output plans. In addition to the issues mentioned above, there are also issues such as advance oil crop purchases that should be properly resolved in order to strive to produce more oil crops this year.

    从经济上支援农民生产油料
    何成
    目前正是春播油料作物的季节。夏播油料作物的准备工作也开始了。各地的农民和农村工作人员正在为实现国家的油料增产计划而积极工作，这是一种好现象。各个经济部门，包括粮食部门、供销合作部门，应该从经济上积极支援农民，帮助他们完成播种任务。
    许多地区的农民反映花生种子不够用。没有种子不能播种，这是一个很严重的问题。解决这个问题的最有效的办法是实行社和社间、相邻地区之间的调剂。但是，新开辟的油料产区和扩大了种植面积的地区，单靠就地调剂是不能完全解决问题的。粮食部门所属的油脂公司，应该配合农业部门，负责供应这些地区所需要的种子。供应种子不仅要抓紧农时，而且要保证质量。今年春季，广东有些地区供给农民的花生种子，80％是不出芽的。各个地区都应该接受这种教训。
    几年来，某些油料集中产区，粮食供应不够充裕。这是影响农民种植油料作物的情绪的一个重要因素。大家想想，如果种植花生、大豆的人，不能得到充分的粮食供应，谁还愿意种花生、大豆呢？油料集中产区的粮食部门，应该根据奖励种植油料作物的精神，在粮食统购统销方面，给种植油料作物的农民以适当的优待和照顾，制定一个切合实际需要的粮食供应办法，并且把这个办法告诉农民，以解除他们害怕种的油料作物多了而粮食不够吃的顾虑。油料集中产区有些农民，因为粮食不够，已经开始吃用大豆。粮食部门应当赶快给他们调拨必要的粮食。
    今年国家将要提高某些油料，例如大豆、芝麻的收购价格。这将使种植油料作物的农民能够得到较多的收益。各个收购油料的部门，要及早把新的价格公布出来，鼓舞农民种植油料作物的热情，按照计划播种，努力提高单位产量。
    国家统购油料的政策是“多产多得，增产多留”。按照这个政策，国家给生产油料的农民留下符合定量标准的油料和必要的种子，然后按照商品量进行比例收购。这样，生产油料多的农民，就可以得到较多的油料。这种办法从去年开始实行，但是许多农民还不熟悉。今年的油料统购任务已经大体确定了，各个地区应该及早把具体数字逐级传达下去，一直传达到合作社和社员，使农民知道今年国家要收购多少，他们自己可以留下多少，这样，他们就可以有计划地安排今年的油料生产工作了。
    我国油料作物的产量是逐年增加的，但是国家规定的种植面积和产量计划并未完成。在经济方面给农民以有力的支援，是保证完成种植计划和产量计划的有效办法。除了上面提到的这些问题，还有油料预购等等问题，应该妥善地加以解决，争取今年生产更多的油料。
