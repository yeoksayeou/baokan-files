The Beijing Old Goods Business, after its joint public-private partnership, has changed its fraudulent practices and expanded its consignment business. Its turnover has been increasing month by month for the past four months. April even saw a new phenomenon of not being affected by the off-season, with total turnover catching up with the highest month in the past peak season, an increase of more than 26% over the same period last year.

In the past, the old goods business mainly engaged in "profiteering" – buying goods and reselling them to other industries at very low prices, coupled with fraudulent practices in business operations, which resulted in poor credit among customers. The transformation of the old goods business in Beijing first focused on these two issues. By adjusting the commercial network, more than 160 old goods businesses were merged into more than 50, each with a larger storefront, expanding consignment sales and reducing "profiteering" business, aiming at the broad consumer market. At the same time, education for employees has been strengthened, advocating the establishment of a business style of genuine goods at fair prices and fair trade. Since the launch of the labor competition in February, it has gradually achieved accurate valuation when receiving goods, so that sellers get a reasonable price. Some purchased goods that were later sold for more money due to inaccurate valuation at the time of purchase were also proactively returned to the seller. When selling, prices are clearly marked and fair, without deception or fraud. This has greatly improved the credibility and reputation of the old goods business, and business is getting better and better.

    北京市旧货商行面貌一新
    公私合营后的北京市旧货商行，改变欺诈作风，扩大委托寄售业务，四个月以来营业额月月上升。四月份并且出现了淡季不淡的新气象，总营业额赶上过去旺季最高月份，比去年同期增加26％以上。
    旧货行，过去主要是做“倒行”生意——收买货物转卖给其他行业，价格很低，再加经营作风上有欺诈行为，在顾客中信用很差。北京市对旧货行的改造首先抓住这两个问题。通过调整商业网把一百六十多家旧货行合并成五十多处，各处都有较宽大的门市部，扩大委托寄售、缩小“倒行”业务，面向广大消费者。同时对职工加强了教育，提倡树立货真价实、买卖公平的经营作风。自二月份开展劳动竞赛以来，已经逐渐做到收进的时候正确估价，使卖主得到合理价格，有些收买下的货物，由于当时估价不准后来多卖了钱的，又主动退还卖主。售出的时候明码实价，不欺不哄。这样便大大提高了旧货行的信用和声誉，生意越做越好。
