Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 21st: The Vietnam Democratic Party issued a statement on the 18th, expressing its welcome for the proposal made by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the South Vietnamese authorities to hold a consultative conference.

Therefore, Vietnamese women demand that the Southern authorities respect the deep desire of Vietnamese women and the entire Vietnamese people for the country to be unified.

The Vietnam Socialist Party, in a statement issued a few days ago, said that the Vietnam Socialist Party will call on the Vietnamese intellectual community to promote work in response to and in support of the reasonable proposal made by the government to the Southern authorities regarding holding a consultative conference to unify the motherland. The statement also believes that intellectuals in the North and South should immediately establish normal relations with each other.

Cadres from various trade unions, government organizations, and enterprises in Hanoi, as well as rural cadres from the outskirts of Hanoi, have also recently held gatherings to express their support for Prime Minister Pham Van Dong's letter to the Southern authorities.
