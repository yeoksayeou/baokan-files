    Spring breezes from the south have swept across the vast lands of Kazakhstan. In early May, when we arrived in Almaty, the capital of the Kazakh Republic, this green city at the foot of the Alatau Mountains, a spur of the Tian Shan range, was in the midst of spring blossoms. Apple orchards were everywhere in the city and its suburbs, a blaze of red and white flowers, making Almaty (which means "Father of Apples" in Kazakh) truly worthy of its name.
    Near Almaty, we also saw some of the reclaimed new lands, although the majority of the new lands are in northern and eastern Kazakhstan. The southern regions of Kazakhstan, including Almaty Oblast, had already completed their sowing plans by this time. Spring plowing is proceeding rapidly in the northern regions. This spring is an extraordinary one for the newly reclaimed lands that are turning Kazakhstan into the largest granary in the eastern Soviet Union. In the past two years, 18 million hectares of new land have been reclaimed in Kazakhstan, equivalent to twice the republic's original cultivated land. Therefore, this spring, Kazakhstan is sowing an unprecedented 27 million hectares, of which 23 million hectares are sown with grains. Spring on the new lands is exceptionally warm. The particularly thick snow of last winter melted quickly into the reclaimed soil. The water supply has also increased. The new lands contain three to four times more moisture than last year. What great news for striving for a bumper harvest in this traditionally arid region! The people we spoke with expressed confidence and joy that the new lands would have an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. Their joyous mood infected us as well. Comrade Yakovlev, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Kazakh Communist Party, told us with great enthusiasm: "This autumn's harvest may fully compensate the state for all investments in land reclamation." We smiled with him.
    Comrade Yakovlev said, "The Kazakh Republic is striving to complete the Sixth Five-Year Plan's targets for agricultural products ahead of schedule. We have set ourselves the task of harvesting 1.4 billion poods of grain in 1956. This year, we will be able to complete the grain production tasks originally scheduled for 1960, increasing grain production fourfold. The five-year plan's increased production targets for sugar beets, cotton, meat, and wool are expected to be completed in two to three years." It goes without saying that the current spring sowing on the new lands is crucial for harvesting 1.4 billion poods of grain.
    Agricultural workers in Kazakhstan, especially the developers of the new lands, have been preparing for the spring sowing. Almost all the spring sowing land has been autumn-plowed. Fifteen million hectares of land have accumulated snow. Tractor stations and state farms have repaired tractors and traction engines in advance. People are putting their hearts and souls into spring plowing. They are committed to not only completing the sowing of vast areas but also completing the sowing within eight to nine days.
    Four state farms have appeared on the newly reclaimed lands in Almaty Oblast. We visited a state farm on the banks of the Kaskelen River. Here, 14,000 hectares were sown in six days. Farm Director Kosherli said, "This year, the weather has been favorable, and we estimate that we can get 10 to 15 centners of grain per hectare. The cost per centner will be reduced from the planned 32 rubles to 27 rubles." The Kaskelen State Farm was only established last spring. Its 500 employees came from Ukraine, the Don region, and Belarus. In a short period, they reclaimed large areas of wasteland and built a new village. In the new village, rows of houses, canteens, shops, and bathhouses stretch along a street. Among the 1,500 residents of the village, 30 young couples got married and 40 children were born, including three sets of twins. Everywhere is filled with the new atmosphere of spring.
    In the vast new lands of northern Kazakhstan, this atmosphere is even stronger. Looking from the plane, the new lands, caressed by the clear spring sunlight, resemble a vast, endless expanse of dark, fertile ocean. Whoever passes through this "sea" of grain production, pioneered by the Soviet people, especially hundreds of thousands of young people, will sincerely shout out to the people who are freely exerting their infinite creative power under the socialist system: "Well done!"
    The laborers on the vast new lands are sowing seeds rapidly with the same soaring enthusiasm as when they reclaimed the land. In the Kustanai Oblast in northern Kazakhstan, thousands of tractor field teams have gone deep into the new lands to carry out the first sowing. The achievements of the state farms, the "organizers" of the new lands, quickly spread. Tractor driver Shushlakov sowed 93 hectares on the first day and 110 hectares on the second day. However, this record was quickly surpassed by his comrades. Tractor driver Gerasimenko sowed 200 hectares in one day. His tractor pulled five seeders. To save labor, the team's accountant also served as a fueler.
    The people of Kokchetav Oblast, which borders Kustanai Oblast, also cherish the first spring of the new Five-Year Plan. This oblast has a newly built "Zhdanov" State Farm. People from Moscow, Leningrad, and southern Russia have reclaimed 22,000 hectares of wasteland here in the past two years. They know that the most important thing after reclaiming the land is to learn and adopt advanced farming experience. Therefore, even during last year's drought, this state farm was able to deliver 800,000 poods of grain to the state. The farm's seven tractor field teams are carrying out spring plowing and are now sowing. People are determined to produce 1.6 million poods of grain this year, reduce the cost of each centner of grain from 39 rubles to 22 rubles, and also deliver potatoes, vegetables, milk, and meat to the state.
    Like all the heroes on the new lands, the people of the "Zhdanov" State Farm are creating conditions to realize this beautiful wish. Comprehensive agricultural technology measures, including the most advanced farming systems, are being adopted. Almost all of the land sown this year has been autumn-plowed, and one-third of the autumn-plowed land has been deep-plowed to a depth of 30 to 35 centimeters using Maltsev's method of cultivation with a non-moldboard plow. Only carefully selected good seeds are being sown. People are striving to harvest 15 centners from each hectare of land, and 20 centners from each hectare of land cultivated using the Maltsev method. They are striving to reach the planned level of 1960 in terms of commodity grain production this year.
    Like the hundreds of newly built state farms on the new lands, the people of this farm have moved from tents and old train cars into new homes. They built beautiful new villages with their own hands. On average, each person lives in an area of four and a half square meters. In the next five years, 5 million rubles will be used to expand construction.
    Like all the residents who have settled down on the new lands, 97 couples on this farm have gotten married. Shortly before May Day, the 96th little resident was born. The settlement of young volunteers on the new lands, their marriage, and their establishment as the earliest residents are of paramount importance for consolidating the newly built state farms.
    The new lands and the sowing for a bumper harvest, the new villages and the prospects for construction and development, the new marriages and the addition of newborns - this is the enviable spring on the reclaimed lands.

    新地的春天
    本报驻苏联记者　李何
    春风从南到北吹遍了广阔的哈萨克斯坦的土地。五月初，当我们到达哈萨克共和国首都阿拉木图的时候，这个在天山支脉阿拉塔乌山麓的绿荫城市正是春暖花开时节。市里市郊到处都是苹果树林，一片红白鲜艳的花朵，使人觉得阿拉木图（哈萨克话是“苹果之父”）真是名符其实。
    在阿拉木图附近我们也见到被开垦了的新地，虽然绝大部分新地是在哈萨克斯坦的北部和东部。包括阿拉木图州在内的哈萨克斯坦南方各地，这时候已经完成了播种计划。春耕正在北部一带迅速进行着。今年春天，对于使哈萨克斯坦变成苏联东部最大的谷仓的已被开垦的新地，是不平常的。最近两年在哈萨克斯坦开垦了一千八百万公顷的新地，等于共和国原有的耕地的两倍，所以今年春天在哈萨克斯坦历史上破天荒播种着二千七百万公顷这样广大的面积，其中谷物的播种面积达到二千三百万公顷。新地上的春天异样暖和。去冬特别厚的积雪很快融化在被开垦的地里了。雪水也多起来。新地饱含着超过去年三四倍的水分。这对于争取素来干旱地区的丰收是多么大的喜讯！和我们接谈的人们流露了今年新地会有一个空前的大丰收的信心和喜悦。他们的高兴的情绪也感染了我们。哈萨克共产党中央委员会书记雅科甫列夫同志兴致勃勃地告诉我们：“今年秋收可能把国家在开垦荒地上的一切投资全部补偿。”我们也随着他笑颜逐开了。
    雅科甫列夫同志说：“哈萨克共和国正在努力争取提早完成第六个五年计划关于农产品的任务。我们向自己提出这样的任务——在1956年收获十四亿普特谷物。在今年就能完成原定在1960年达到的谷物生产的任务，把谷物产量增加四倍。甜菜、棉花、肉类和羊毛的五年计划增产任务预期将在两三年内完成。”不说也明白，新地上此刻的春播，对于收获十四亿普特谷物是有决定意义的。
    哈萨克斯坦农业劳动者，特别是新地的开拓者们，在春播以前就作好了准备工作。几乎所有春播地都经过秋耕。一千五百万公顷土地聚过雪。拖拉机站和国营农场预先修理好拖拉机和牵引机。人们精神饱满地投入春耕。他们保证不但完成广大面积的播种，而且在八九天内完成播种。
    在阿拉木图州被开垦的新地上出现了四个国营农场。我们访问了在卡斯克连斯基河边的一个国营农场。这里在六天内完成了一万四千公顷的播种。场长科什尔雷说：“今年风调雨顺，估计每公顷可以得到十到十五公担谷物。每公担的成本将从计划的三十二卢布降低到二十七卢布。”卡斯克连斯基国营农场是去年春天才建立的。它的五百名职工是从乌克兰、顿河、白俄罗斯各处来的。在短短期间，他们开垦了大片荒地而且建设了一座新村。在新村里，一条街上伸展着两排住宅和食堂、商店、澡堂等建筑物。全村一千五百名居民当中，三十对青年结了婚，生了四十个小孩，其中三家生了双生子。到处充满着春天一般蓬勃发展的新气息。
    在哈萨克斯坦北方一带广大的新地上，这种气息也更加强烈。从飞机上了望，在晴朗的春天阳光抚爱下的那些新地，宛如一下子飞渡不尽的黑黝黝的汪洋大海。不论谁路过这个由苏联人民首先是几十万青年所开拓的生产谷物的“大海”，他都会诚心地对在社会主义制度下畅快地发挥自己的无穷的创造力量的人们叫一声：“好！”
    广大的新地上的劳动者们以开荒时那样高涨的热情，迅速地播下种子。在哈萨克斯坦北部库斯坦奈州，千百个拖拉机田间工作队深入新地，进行第一次播种。新地的“组织者”国营农场的成绩很快传开了。拖拉机手舒什拉科夫第一天播种了九十三公顷，第二天一百一十公顷。但是，这个纪录很快被他的同伴超过了。拖拉机手格拉西明科在一天内播种了二百公顷。他的拖拉机挂了五部播种机。为了节省劳动力，拖拉机队里计算员兼做添油员。
    和库斯坦奈州接壤的柯克齐塔夫州的人们同样珍重新的五年计划的第一个春天。这个州有一个新建的“日丹诺夫”国营农场。从莫斯科、列宁格勒和南俄罗斯来的人们过去两年在这里开垦了二万二千公顷荒地。他们知道开荒后最重要的事情是学习和采用先进的农作经验。所以在去年干旱时候这个国营农场还能够交给国家八十万普特谷物。这个农场的七个拖拉机田间工作队进行了春耘，正进行着播种。人们决心在今年生产一百六十万普特谷物，把每公担谷物的成本从三十九卢布减低到二十二卢布，此外还交给国家马铃薯、蔬菜、牛奶和肉类。
    像所有新地上的主人公一样，“日丹诺夫”国营农场的人们为实现这个美好的愿望创造着条件。成套农业技术措施，包括最进步的耕作制度，被采用着。今年播种的土地几乎全都秋耕过，而且三分之一的秋耕地参照了马尔采夫耕作方法，用无板的犁深耕三十到三十五公分。播种的都是精选的好种子。人们争取从每公顷土地收十五公担，从用马尔采夫方法耕作的土地上每公顷收二十公担。他们争取在商品谷物的生产方面今年达到计划中1960年的水平。
    像新地上几百个新建的国营农场一样，这个农场的人们已经从帐幕和旧车箱搬进了新居。他们用自己的手建筑了漂亮的新村。平均每人住着四个半平方公尺面积。今后五年中将用五百万卢布扩展建设。
    像所有新地上成家立业的居民一样，这个农场的居民有九十七对结了婚。“五一”节前不久出生了第九十六名小居民。青年志愿开荒者在新地上成家立业，定居下来，成为当地最早的居民，这对于巩固新建的国营农场有着不可忽视的头等意义。
    新地和争取丰收的播种，新村和建设发展的远景，新婚和初生儿的增添，——这就是被开垦的土地上令人羡慕的春天。
