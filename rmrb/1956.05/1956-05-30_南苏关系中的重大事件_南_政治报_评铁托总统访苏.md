Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, 28th: According to TASS, "Politika" published an editorial on the 27th, stating that President Tito's upcoming visit to the Soviet Union is an important stage in the cause of improving and developing international relations. The significance of this visit is not limited to the relationship between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. It is a contribution to the efforts being made in Europe and around the world to consolidate peace and promote mutual understanding and trust.

The newspaper wrote that striving for closer ties between countries and peoples is a characteristic of current political activities in Europe and Asia. At the current stage of international relations, negotiations between the highest-level national leaders and politicians (regardless of whether they are representatives of large or small countries) can increase the possibility of further mutual understanding, peaceful coexistence, and international cooperation. At the same time, such negotiations also create conditions for resolving outstanding international issues.

The newspaper pointed out that President Tito's visit to the Soviet Union, one year after the visit of Soviet leaders Bulganin and Khrushchev to Yugoslavia, is undoubtedly a major event in Soviet-Yugoslav relations. Since the signing of the Belgrade Declaration between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, Soviet-Yugoslav relations based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, mutual respect, equality, and independence have continuously improved. This contact and meeting in Moscow is a necessary continuation of this relationship and will further deepen it, benefiting the friendly cooperation between the two countries and future international reconciliation.

The newspaper wrote that it is now very clear that this visit to the Soviet Union will open up new prospects for closer cooperation, because this contact is between two countries building socialism. There is no doubt that in the process of this rapprochement and development of cooperation, President Tito's visit will help improve Yugoslavia's relations with Eastern European countries, and will also be helpful for joint efforts to establish independent and equal international cooperation.

    南苏关系中的重大事件
    南“政治报”评铁托总统访苏
    新华社28日讯　据塔斯社贝尔格莱德讯：“政治报”在二十七日发表社论说，铁托总统即将访问苏联一事，是改善和发展国际关系事业中的一个重要阶段。这次访问的意义并不限于南苏两国之间。它对欧洲和世界各地为了巩固和平和促进相互谅解和信任而采取的努力，是一个贡献。
    报纸写道，为了各国之间和各国人民之间的更加接近而努力，这是欧洲和亚洲当前政治活动的特征。在国际关系的现阶段，最高级国家领导人和政治家（不问他们是大国或是小国的代表）的谈判，可以为进一步相互了解、和平共处和国际合作增大可能性。同时，这种谈判也为解决悬而未决的国际问题创造条件。
    报纸指出，铁托总统这次在苏联国家领导人布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访问南斯拉夫一周年的时候到苏联去访问，毫无疑问是南苏关系中的一个重大事件。自从苏南贝尔格莱德宣言签字后，建筑在和平共处、互相尊重、平等和独立的原则上的苏南关系不断改进。这次将在莫斯科举行的接触和会谈，是这种关系的必然的延续，并且将使这种关系进一步加深，以利于两国的友好合作和今后的国际和解。
    报纸写道，现在十分清楚，这次对苏联的访问将为更密切的合作打开新的前景，因为这次接触是两个建设社会主义的国家之间的接触。毫无疑问，在这种接近和发展合作的过程中，铁托总统的访问将有助于改善南斯拉夫同东欧国家的关系，而且对于共同努力建立独立平等的国际合作也是有帮助的。
