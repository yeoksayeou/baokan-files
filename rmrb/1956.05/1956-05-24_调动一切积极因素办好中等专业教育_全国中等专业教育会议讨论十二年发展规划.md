    Mobilize All Positive Factors to Run Secondary Specialized Education Well
    National Secondary Specialized Education Conference Discusses Twelve-Year Development Plan

    The National Secondary Specialized Education Conference concluded in Beijing on the 22nd. The conference discussed the twelve-year development plan for secondary specialized education, as well as how to mobilize all positive factors to run secondary specialized education well, and other issues.

    The conference pointed out that in order to meet the needs of national construction, secondary specialized education should, in the future, focus on training technical and management cadres for industry on the basis of universal development; at the same time, it should cooperate with the rapid development of the agricultural cooperativization movement to train technical and management cadres for agriculture. In order to meet the needs of the Second Five-Year Plan for secondary specialized cadres, secondary specialized education must be accelerated in the next three years; at the same time, efforts must be made to actively develop spare-time secondary specialized education. In secondary specialized education, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the educational policy of all-round development, and strive to basically complete teaching reform in about three years.

    The conference believed that potential should be tapped and efforts should be made to mobilize all possible forces to teach in secondary specialized schools. The conference also discussed measures to give play to the enthusiasm of existing teachers in schools. The conference believes that the enthusiasm of secondary specialized school teachers to master advanced science and technology must be led and supported; teachers' advance towards science must start from mastering their own business, and combine further study with teaching work according to the needs of the country.

    The conference was convened on the 14th.

    调动一切积极因素办好中等专业教育
    全国中等专业教育会议讨论十二年发展规划
    全国中等专业教育会议二十二日在北京结束。这次会议讨论了中等专业教育十二年发展规划，以及调动一切积极因素办好中等专业教育等问题。
    会议指出，为了适应国家建设的需要，中等专业教育今后应当在普遍发展的基础上，重点培养工业的技术干部和管理干部；同时配合农业合作化运动的迅速开展，培养农业的技术干部和管理干部。为了适应第二个五年计划对中等专业干部的需要，在最近三年内，中等专业教育要加速发展；同时要积极发展业余中等专业教育。在中等专业教育中，必须认真贯彻全面发展的教育方针，努力在三年左右的时间内基本上完成教学改革。
    会议认为应该发掘潜力，争取调动一切可能调动的力量到中等专业学校任教。会议还讨论了发挥学校现有教师积极性的措施。会议认为，对中等专业学校教师渴望掌握先进科学技术的热情必须加以领导和支持；教师向科学进军，必须从精通本行业务做起，按照国家的需要把进修学习和教学工作结合起来。
    会议是从十四日起召开的。
