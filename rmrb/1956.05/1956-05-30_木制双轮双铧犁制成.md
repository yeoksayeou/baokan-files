    Wooden Double-Wheeled Double-Share Plow Made
    A wooden double-wheeled double-share plow, which can save a lot of steel, has been successfully trial-produced in Anhui Province. On the afternoon of the 25th, the Provincial General Agricultural Experiment Station used two oxen to pull this plow in dry land for testing. The results were exactly the same as the steel double-wheeled double-share plow in terms of plowing effect. The testers also installed a pair of boat-shaped gliding boards under the wheels of this plow and tested it in paddy fields, with very good results.
    This plow can save a lot of steel. In addition to the plowshare, moldboard, and some accessories, which require about 15 kilograms of steel, the rest can all be made of wood, saving 80 kilograms of steel per unit. In addition, this plow is easy to use, and it is very easy for two oxen to pull. The cost is also very low.
    The agricultural department of Anhui Province has decided to promote this wooden double-wheeled double-share plow. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    木制双轮双铧犁制成
    一种可以大量节省钢材的木制双轮双铧犁在安徽省试制成功了。二十五日下午，这个省的农业试验总站用两条牛拉着这种犁在旱地上进行了试验，结果，和钢制的双轮双铧犁耕作效果完全一样。试验者又在这种犁的轮子下面安上一付船形的滑行板，在水田里试验，效果也非常好。
    这种犁可以大量节省钢材，除了犁头、犁镜和一些配件约需用十五公斤钢材以外，其余全部可以用木料，每部即可节省钢材八十公斤。此外，这种犁使用轻便，两条牛拉着走很轻快。成本也很低。
    安徽省农业部门已经决定推广这种木制双轮双铧犁。（据新华社讯）
