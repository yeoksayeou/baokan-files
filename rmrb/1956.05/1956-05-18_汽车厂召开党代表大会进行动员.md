    Striving to Produce Automobiles Ahead of Schedule
    Automobile Factory Holds Party Congress to Mobilize
    The first Congress of the Communist Party of China's First Automobile Works opened on May 17. This congress, convened on the eve of automobile production, aims to mobilize all positive factors to strive for the early production of the first domestically produced automobile.
    Currently, the production adjustment work of all thirteen basic production workshops in the factory is nearing completion, and 83% of automobile parts have been trial-produced. Some workshops are carrying out the assembly of components and sub-assemblies, and have successively assembled eight sub-assemblies such as front axles, rear axles, drive shafts, and water tanks. The trial assembly of the automobile's heart – the engine and gearbox – has also been completed one month ahead of schedule. The foundry and stamping workshops, which adjusted production later, have also trial-produced a batch of castings and parts.
    On the first day of the Congress, conservative ideas in the areas of cadre utilization, concern for employee welfare, and the conduct of ideological struggle within the Party were examined and criticized. All leading personnel were required to go deep among the masses, lead all factory employees in learning technology and management experience, and bring their subjective initiative into play to overcome the current difficulties in the supply of steel and collaborative products, in order to produce high-quality domestically produced automobiles ahead of schedule.

    争取提早出产汽车
    汽车厂召开党代表大会进行动员
    中共第一汽车制造厂第一次代表大会在五月十七日开幕。这次在出产汽车前夜召开的大会，要动员一切积极因素争取提早生产出第一辆国产汽车。
    现在，全厂十三个基本生产车间调整生产的工作都快要完成了，已经试制出了83％的汽车零件。有些车间正在进行合件和总成的装配工作，先后装配出前轴、后桥、传动轴和水箱等八个总成。汽车的心脏——发动机、变速箱的试装工作也比原计划提前一个月完成。调整生产较晚的铸工车间和冲压车间，也试生产出一批铸件和零件。
    大会第一天检查和批判了在使用干部、关心职工生活和开展党内思想斗争等方面的保守思想，要求全体领导人员深入群众，领导全厂职工学好技术，学好管理经验，并且要发挥主观能动性，努力克服目前钢材和协作产品供应不上的困难，以便提早生产出质量优良的国产汽车来。
