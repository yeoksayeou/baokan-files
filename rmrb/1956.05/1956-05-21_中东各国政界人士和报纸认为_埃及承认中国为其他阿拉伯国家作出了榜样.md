Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 20th: Middle Eastern politicians and media continue to welcome Egypt's decision to recognize China. They also enthusiastically discussed that other Arab countries should also recognize China.

According to the Middle East News Agency, Jordanian Prime Minister Samir al-Rifai said that Egypt's decision was a very successful measure.

Jordanian political parties and organizations telegraphed the governments of Arab countries and the Arab League Political Committee meeting in Damascus on May 18, requesting that all Arab countries recognize China.

According to United Press International, Syrian Finance Minister Abdul Wahab Homad predicted that Syria would follow Egypt in recognizing China. He said that the Syrian government will study the issue of recognizing China and will probably make a decision that will make Western countries think thoroughly. This is a decision that will put Western countries on a more correct and practical basis in their anti-Arab attitude.

Akram al-Hourani, leader of the Syrian Ba'ath Socialist Party, hopes that the Syrian government will also recognize China. Syrian parliamentarian and member of the Constitutional Bloc, Muhammad Mubarak, said that we welcome this measure of recognizing the world's largest country. We hope that all other Arab countries will take the same steps, especially because there is no reason to ignore reality.

Lebanon's "Al-Akhbar" and "Al-Yom," and Syria's "Al-Shola" and "Al-Thقافة," have all published articles welcoming Egypt's decision to recognize China.

Many Jordanian newspapers also published editorials on May 19, calling on all Arab countries to follow Egypt's example and recognize the People's Republic of China.

    中东各国政界人士和报纸认为
    埃及承认中国为其他阿拉伯国家作出了榜样
    据新华社开罗20日电　中东各国政界人士和舆论继续表示欢迎埃及承认中国的决定。他们并且热烈地谈到其他阿拉伯国家也应该承认中国。
    据中东通讯社报道，约旦首相萨米尔·埃尔·里法伊说，埃及的决定是非常成功的措施。
    约旦各政党和政治组织曾在五月十八日打电报给阿拉伯各国政府和正在大马士革开会的阿拉伯联盟政治委员会，要求各阿拉伯国家都承认中国。
    据合众社报道，叙利亚财政部长阿卜杜勒·瓦哈布·霍马德预言叙利亚将继埃及之后承认中国。他说，叙利亚政府将研究承认中国问题，大概将作出一个会使西方国家彻底想一想的决定，这就是会使西方国家在它们的反阿拉伯态度方面处于一个比较正确和实际的基础上的决定。
    叙利亚复兴社会党领袖阿克拉姆·霍拉姆希望叙利亚政府也承认中国。叙利亚议员、宪法集团成员穆罕默德·莫巴里克说，我们欢迎承认世界最大国家的这一措施。我们希望所有其他的阿拉伯国家都将采取同样的步骤，特别是因为没有理由忽视现实。
    黎巴嫩“新闻报”和“今天报”，叙利亚“火炬报”和“文化报”，都发表了文章，欢迎埃及承认中国的决定。
    约旦的许多报纸五月十九日也发表社论，要求所有阿拉伯国家以埃及为榜样，承认中华人民共和国。
