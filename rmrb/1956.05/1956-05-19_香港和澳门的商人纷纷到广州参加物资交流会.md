Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 17th. Businessmen from Hong Kong and Macau are flocking to Guangzhou to participate in the Guangdong Province Materials Exhibition and Exchange Conference, which is currently being held here. As of today, more than 200 Hong Kong and Macau businessmen have registered with the conference, including three major trade delegations organized by the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Import and Export Merchants Association, and the Nam Pak Hong Association, as well as the Macau Industry and Commerce Trade Delegation and trade personnel from more than ten industries in Hong Kong, such as vegetables.
　　In recent months, an increasing number of businessmen from Hong Kong and Macau have come to Guangzhou to establish trade relations. In the two Guangzhou Export Commodities Exhibition and Exchange Conferences held last winter and spring alone, more than 300 Hong Kong and Macau firms came to Guangzhou for the first time and established trade relations. A building materials merchant from Hong Kong returned to Guangzhou for the first time in March this year and, seeing that the tiles produced in Tangshan and Wenzhou were of good quality, purchased tens of thousands of yuan worth at once. Some Hong Kong and Macau merchants have also signed long-term agency or exclusive sales contracts for certain commodities with Guangzhou's trading institutions. Many Hong Kong and Macau businessmen have also returned this year in an organized manner by industry to participate in material exchange activities.
　　Gao Zhuoxiong, advisor to the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce trade delegation, and Li Jingxi, head of the Chinese Import and Export Merchants Association trade delegation, both spoke to reporters about the benefits of returning to Guangzhou to trade for Hong Kong and Macau businessmen. Gao Zhuoxiong said: "A large department store in Hong Kong that was once losing money has turned from loss to profit since dealing in goods from the motherland!" Li Jingxi, after describing the thriving scene of some Hong Kong stores specializing in food products from the motherland, said: "Last year there was only one such food store, but now it has rapidly increased to more than ten!"

    香港和澳门的商人纷纷到广州参加物资交流会
    据新华社广州17日电　香港和澳门的工商界人士纷纷前来广州参加正在这里举行的广东省物资展览交流大会。到今天止，向大会报到的港澳工商界人士已经有二百多人，其中有香港中华总商会、中华出入口商会和南北行公所组织的三大贸易代表团，澳门工商贸易代表团，以及香港的蔬菜等十多个行业的贸易人员。
    最近几个月以来，到广州建立贸易关系的港澳两地工商界人士已经越来越多。仅在去冬和今春两度举行的广州出口物资展览交流会上，就有三百多家港澳商号第一次到广州来建立了贸易关系。香港有一家建筑材料商人，今年三月第一次回到广州，看到唐山和温州等地出产的瓷砖质量很好，一次就购买了数十万元。有些港澳商人还同广州的贸易机构签订了某种商品的长期代理或包销合约。许多港澳工商界人士今年还都按行业有组织地回来参加物资交流活动。
    香港中华总商会贸易代表团顾问高卓雄和中华出入口商会贸易代表团团长李景熙，都先后和记者谈到回广州贸易给港澳工商界带来的好处。高卓雄说：“香港有一家曾经亏本的大百货公司，自从经营祖国商品后，就从亏本转为盈利了！”李景熙讲述了香港一些专营祖国食品的商店的兴旺景象后说：“去年这样的食品店只有一家，现在已迅速增加到十多家了！”
