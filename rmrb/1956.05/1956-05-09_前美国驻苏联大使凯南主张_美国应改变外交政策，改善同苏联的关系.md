Xinhua News Agency, New York, 8th. TASS, New York, 8th. "New York Times" correspondent in Washington, Reston, reported on the content of a speech made by former U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kennan, to the Foreign Policy Association on May 4th. The ambassador called for a change in U.S. foreign policy, advocating for improved relations with the Soviet Union.

According to Reston, Kennan believes that a large part of the United States' difficulties on the international stage is the result of adopting an "inflexible attitude" towards other countries. Kennan believes that this attitude is "wrong and violates the long-term interests of the United States." Kennan particularly criticized the U.S.'s tendency to "adopt a wait-and-see attitude until the Soviet Union or world opinion forces the United States to adapt to the now-obvious international situation."

Regarding the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union, Kennan said, "Americans should remember the different histories of the two countries." Reston wrote: "Kennan does not believe there is any reason why a satisfactory and promising relationship has not been established between the United States and the Soviet Union. He advocates that the two countries should be moderate when making demands on each other and should learn to 'restrain accusations and excitement,' while the United States has been filling any relationship with the Russians with accusations and excitement. Kennan specifically advocates efforts to 'restore a normal atmosphere in U.S.-Soviet relations.'"

Kennan condemned attempts to restore the capitalist system in Eastern European countries. He went on to express his opposition to the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and the People's Republic of China, but he believes that the United States should not obstruct the admission of the People's Republic of China into the United Nations, because the majority of United Nations member states "hope to admit" the People's Republic of China.

On the German issue, Kennan said: "I believe that the aim of U.S. policy should be to restore the unification of Germany and make this country a neutral factor as soon as possible..." Kennan believes that U.S. military bases should be "abolished as soon as possible," and he believes that the existence of military bases "damages" the interests of the United States.

    前美国驻苏联大使凯南主张
　　美国应改变外交政策，改善同苏联的关系
    新华社8日讯  塔斯社纽约八日讯：“纽约时报”驻华盛顿记者赖斯顿报道了前美国驻苏联大使凯南五月四日在美国外交政策协会发表的演说的内容，这位大使要求改变美国的外交政策，主张改善同苏联的关系。
    据赖斯顿报道，凯南认为，美国在国际舞台上的很大一部分困难是由于对其他国家采取“不灵活态度”的结果。凯南认为，这种态度是“错误的，并且是违反美国的长远利益的”。凯南特别指责美国这样一种倾向：“在苏联或者世界舆论迫使美国适应现在已经看得十分明显的国际局势之前采取等待态度”。
    至于美国和苏联的关系，凯南说，“美国人应当记住两国的历史不同”。赖斯顿写道：“对于美国和苏联之间为什么没有建立使人满意的和可以寄予希望的关系这一点，凯南不认为有任何理由。他主张两国在相互提出要求时应当适中，应当学会‘克制责难和激动’，而美国一直在使同俄国人的任何关系上充满责难和激动。凯南特别主张努力‘在美苏关系方面恢复正常气氛’。”
    凯南谴责那些想在东欧国家恢复资本主义制度的企图。他接着又表示反对在美国和中华人民共和国之间建立外交关系，但是他认为，美国不应当阻挠接纳中华人民共和国进入联合国，因为联合国大多数会员国“希望接纳”中华人民共和国。
    在德国问题方面，凯南说：“我认为，美国政策的目的应当在于恢复德国的统一，尽早地使这个国家成为一个中立的因素………”凯南认为，应当“尽快撤消美国军事基地”，他认为，军事基地的存在使美国的利益“遭到损失”。
