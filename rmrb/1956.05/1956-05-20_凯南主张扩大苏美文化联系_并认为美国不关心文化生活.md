    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 19th (TASS dispatch from New York, 18th): Former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, George Kennan, delivered a speech at a gathering in New York, advocating for the expansion of cultural ties between the United States and the Soviet Union. Kennan criticized the US government for making it difficult for foreigners to obtain visas to enter the United States, requiring them to be fingerprinted like criminals. He said this situation hinders the development of cultural ties between the United States and other countries, often bringing losses to culture and American cultural life as a whole. This makes events such as scientific and cultural conferences in the United States very difficult.
    Kennan said that in the United States, there is a tendency to "treat its own cultural life with indifference." "For example, we spend millions of dollars annually on horse racing and gambling, but our capital does not even have an opera house."
    Kennan said, "As far as I know, there are very few countries in the world that disrespect artists, writers, composers, or thinkers as much as our country does."

    凯南主张扩大苏美文化联系
    并认为美国不关心文化生活
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社纽约十八日讯：前美国驻苏联大使凯南在纽约一个集会上发表演说，主张扩大美国和苏联之间的文化联系。凯南指责美国政府使得外国人不能顺利地领到进入美国的签证，而要他们像刑事犯那样打指印。他说，这种情况阻碍了美国同其他国家文化联系的发展，往往给整个文化和美国的文化生活带来损失。这使得在美国举行科学和文化会议这类事情非常困难。
    凯南说，在美国有一种“对待自己的文化生活漠不关心”的倾向。“例如，我们每年在赛马和赌博上要花费几百万美圆，但是我们的首都却连一所歌剧院都没有。”
    凯南说，“据我所知，世界上像我国这样不尊重艺术家、作家、作曲家或思想家的国家是很少的。”
