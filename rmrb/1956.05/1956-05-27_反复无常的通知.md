    Fickle Notifications
    Comrade Editor:
    I am a teacher at the No. 1 Hui Primary School in Cangzhen, Cangxian County, Hebei Province. On April 23rd, at noon, the education section of the town people's committee issued a notice requiring teachers in our school to suspend classes at 9:00 AM on the 25th (Wednesday) to listen to the report from the visiting Soviet primary school teachers' delegation. On the 24th, we told the students about the suspension of classes. Who knew that on the same evening, the education section sent an urgent notice saying, "There will be no meeting at 9:00 AM tomorrow, classes will be held as usual." Our school has more than 900 students, and they live far apart. In order not to affect the students' studies, the teachers had to go around notifying the students all night. Despite this, many students did not come on the morning of the 25th.
    At around 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 25th, another urgent notice came from the education section, saying, "Listen to the report at 8:00 AM tomorrow, no classes in the morning." So, we rushed around for a while to notify the students. Who knew that at 8:00 PM, another urgent notice came, saying, "Tomorrow's report is changed to 6:00 PM in the afternoon, classes as usual in the morning."
    Comrade Editor, the four consecutive, fickle urgent notices from the education section of the Cangzhen People's Committee have really exhausted us. There are five primary schools in Cangzhen, and the teachers in the other four schools have also suffered the same fate as us.　Ma Shouxin

    反复无常的通知
    编辑同志：
    我是河北省沧县沧镇回民第一小学的教师。四月二十三日中午，镇人民委员会教育股发来一个通知，要我校教师在二十五日（星期三）上午九点停课去听小学教师访苏代表的传达报告。二十四日，我们就把停课的事情告诉了学生。谁知道就在当天晚上，教育股又来了紧急通知，说是“明天上午九点不开会了，照常上课”。我们学校有九百多个学生，住的又分散，为了不影响学生的学习，老师们只得连夜去分头通知学生。尽管这样，二十五日上午还是有许多学生没有来。
    二十五日下午六点多钟，教育股的紧急通知又来了，说是“明天上午八点听报告，上午的课不上了”。于是，我们又为通知学生而奔忙了一阵。谁知道，到晚上八点多，又来了一个紧急通知，说是“明天报告改为下午六点，上午照常上课”。
    编辑同志，沧镇人民委员会教育股连续发来这四个反复无常的紧急通知，真使我们疲于奔命。沧镇共有五个小学，另外四个小学的教师们也都受到了同我们一样的遭遇。　马守信
