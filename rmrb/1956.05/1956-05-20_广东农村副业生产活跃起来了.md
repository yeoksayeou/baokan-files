    Operating diverse agricultural and sideline production
    The Lantan Township Xin Cun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, recently organized a portion of its labor force to reclaim wasteland in Fenyi County, leaving another portion to reclaim wasteland within the cooperative, expanding the planting area of crops such as sweet potatoes, taro, sorghum, jute, and tobacco. At the same time, the cooperative also drew a portion of people to engage in diverse sideline productions such as lime burning, brick and tile making, pottery making, pig raising, and fish farming, without affecting agricultural production.
    This spring, the cooperative invested more than 1,200 yuan in agricultural production using the income from developing sideline production. According to the current plan, the cooperative's income from developing sideline production this year can increase by more than 65,300 yuan, accounting for 41.3% of the cooperative's total income.

    经营多种农副业生产
    江西省萍乡县澜潭乡新村农业生产合作社最近组织了一部分劳动力到分宜县去开荒，留下一部分劳动力开垦社里的荒地，扩大甘薯、芋头、高粱、黄麻、烟叶等作物的种植面积。同时，社里还抽调一部分人在不影响农业生产的情况下，从事烧石灰、制砖瓦、制陶器、养猪、养鱼等多种副业生产。
    今年春天，这个社就利用发展副业生产的收入向农业生产投资一千二百多元。按照现在的计划，这个社今年发展副业生产能增加六万五千三百多元的收入，占全社总收入的41.3％。（本报驻南昌记者）
