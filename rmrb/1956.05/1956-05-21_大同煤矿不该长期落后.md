Datong Coal Mine Should Not Lag Behind Long-Term
By our reporter Gu Ye

The Datong Mining Bureau did not fulfill the 1955 state plan. The director of the Mining Bureau once went to the Taiyuan Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry to plead: "Consider that we have completed the state plan, and we will be responsible for making up the coal deficit in the first quarter of 1956!" However, in the first quarter of this year, not only was last year's deficit not made up, but also tens of thousands of tons of coal were underproduced, costs exceeded the budget by more than 600,000 yuan, and the quality was also poor.

At the end of January, the Mining Bureau believed that the power plant outage time was longer than in the past and decided to revise the February plan to produce 27,000 tons less raw coal than the state plan.

In fact, although the power outage caused some difficulties in completing the task, the Mining Bureau could have taken advantage of this opportunity to do a good job in equipment maintenance, roadway maintenance, and yard work above and below the well, so that when there was electricity, it could concentrate its efforts on production and turn unfavorable factors into favorable factors. Unfortunately, the leaders of the Mining Bureau did not do this. Not only that, but the number of electromechanical accidents this year increased more than three times compared with the same period last year. Of course, the state plan could not be completed.

In the Datong Mining Bureau, there are many valuable advanced experiences, which, if carefully promoted, would be of great significance to ensuring the completion of the state plan. Unfortunately, the leaders do not go deep into their work, and they do not understand the content of the advanced experience and what issues should be paid attention to. They ordered the promotion, so the effect was not great. For example, the advanced experience of implementing the work section system is to strengthen the direct leadership of the mine level over the grass-roots organizations, cancel the leadership structure at the wellhead level, and facilitate timely detection and resolution of problems. In the fourth quarter of last year, the Mining Bureau had already conducted a typical experiment in the Silaogou Mine. Because the leaders did not go deep, they only saw the various benefits of implementing the work section system, and did not understand what issues should be paid attention to when promoting it in different units. In February of this year, it was widely promoted in most mines. As a result, the wellhead-level cadres were gone, the work section-level cadres did not know how to work, and the mine could not connect with the work section-level cadres in a timely manner, and the coal mining work surface lost its leadership, causing confusion in production. The advanced experience of promoting the one-shift coal mining system is also the same.

If the leadership work is not in-depth, problems in production cannot be solved in a timely manner. For example, it is better for the coal mining work surface to be longer, and it is better for the coal cutting machine to cut deeper. In the Datong Coal Mine, some work surfaces are getting shorter and shorter, and some coal cutting machines are cutting shallower and shallower, resulting in less coal production.

The leaders of the Datong Mining Bureau have been working superficially and are satisfied with general appeals for a long time. Why is this? Some comrades have realized that they are carrying several big burdens. That is: the geological conditions of the Datong Coalfield are good, the Datong Coal Mine has developed greatly compared with the past, the degree of mechanization is quite high, and it is one of the five major coal mines in the country. Therefore, the leaders feel that they can sit back and relax. It is precisely this slack and complacent mood that isolates them from the outside world and from the reality of production. They do not know that other coal mines have made great strides forward, and they do not know that the problems in production are developing more and more seriously. When production is not good, what they see are only objective difficulties, and they treat other people's criticisms as "water off a duck's back." In this way, the Datong Coal Mine is becoming more and more backward. Now, with the help of their superiors, the leaders of the Datong Mining Bureau have taken some measures to reverse the backward situation of the enterprise. However, whether this backward situation can be quickly and thoroughly reversed depends on whether they have the determination to completely overcome generalized leadership.

    大同煤矿不该长期落后
    本报记者　顾页
    大同矿务局没有完成1955年的国家计划。矿务局局长曾经到煤炭工业部太原管理局请求说：“算我们已经完成了国家计划吧，亏欠的煤，我们负责在1956年第一季度补起来！”可是，今年第一季度不但没有弥补上去年的亏欠，而且欠产几万吨煤，成本超支六十多万元，质量也不好。
    一月底，矿务局认为电厂停电的时间比过去长了，决定把二月份的计划修改得比国家计划少产原煤二万七千多吨。
    其实，停电虽然给完成任务造成了一定的困难，但是，矿务局完全可以利用这一个机会把机电设备、巷道维护、井上井下的车场等等工作做好，以便有电的时候，集中力量生产，变不利因素为有利因素。可惜，矿务局的领导人没有这样做。不仅如此，今年机电事故次数比去年同期的还增加了三倍多。当然就完不成国家计划了。
    在大同矿务局，有很多很有价值的先进经验，只要认真加以推广，对保证完成国家计划是很有意义的。可惜领导人员工作不深入，没有弄清楚先进经验的内容和应该注意哪些问题，就下令推广，所以效果不大。比如实行工段制的先进经验，是为了加强矿一级对基层组织的直接领导，取消井口一级领导建制，便于及时发现问题和解决问题。去年第四季，矿务局已经在四老沟矿进行了典型试验。因为领导人不深入，只看到实行工段制的各种好处，而不了解在不同的单位推广，需要注意哪些问题，今年二月便在大多数矿普遍推行。结果，井口一级干部没有了，工段一级干部不知道如何工作，矿上又不能和工段一级干部及时衔接，采煤工作面失去了领导，造成生产中的混乱。推广一班采煤制的先进经验也如此。
    领导工作不深入，在生产中发生了问题都得不到及时的解决。比如采煤工作面长一些为好，截煤机割的深一些更好。大同煤矿有的工作面却是越来越短，有的截煤机越割越浅，就少产了煤。
    大同矿务局的领导人员工作不深入，满足于一般的号召，已经有长久时间了。为什么会这样呢？有些同志已经醒悟到，原来他们背着几个大包袱。这就是：大同煤田的地质条件好，大同煤矿比起过去来已经有很大的发展，机械化程度相当高，又是全国五大煤矿之一。领导人员因此觉得可以高枕无忧了。正是这种松懈自满的情绪，把他们自己跟外界隔绝开来，跟生产实际隔绝开来，不知道别的煤矿都已大踏步地前进了，不知道生产中的问题正在发展得越来越严重。生产不好了，他们看到的只是客观困难，对别人的批评，都当作“耳旁风”，这样，就使大同煤矿越来越落后。现在，大同矿务局的领导者们在上级帮助下，已经采取某些措施，来扭转本企业的落后局面。不过，这个落后局面能不能迅速扭转和彻底扭转，还要看他们有没有决心彻底克服一般化的领导。
