    Shanghai Holds Broadcasting Conference

    Shanghai held a broadcasting conference on the 18th to welcome the representatives who attended the National Conference of Advanced Producers back to Shanghai.

    Ma Tianshui, Deputy Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Zhong Min, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, extended warm welcomes on behalf of the Party and the Trade Union to the more than three hundred representatives of advanced producers gathered in the Trade Union Auditorium. They called on Party and Trade Union organizations to conscientiously organize the dissemination of the spirit of the National Conference of Advanced Producers and to implement the spirit of the conference into the advanced producer movement that has already been widely launched.

    Zhu Shunyu, Deputy Director of the Blade Workshop of the State-owned Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory, and Shi Meixin, a physician at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Shanghai First Medical College, spoke at the meeting, expressing their determination to widely disseminate the resolutions of the conference and the advanced experience they had learned.

    This broadcasting conference is the beginning of Shanghai's extensive dissemination and implementation of the spirit of the National Conference of Advanced Producers. On the 18th, the Liberation Daily published the "Instructions of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China on Strengthening the Party's Leadership over Socialist Competition and Widely Developing the Advanced Producer Movement." Prior to this, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions convened a meeting of persons in charge of various industrial trade unions, arranged for the dissemination work, and had already rushed to print 120,000 copies of "A Letter from All Representatives of the National Conference of Advanced Producers to Workers Across the Country," ready to be read and discussed among workers throughout the city.
