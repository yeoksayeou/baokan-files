The Lanhe Agricultural Production Cooperative (advanced cooperative) in Yueyang County, Hunan Province, preliminarily formulated its agricultural production plan for this year in December of last year. It plans to expand the planting of double-cropping rice by more than 4,000 mu, with an estimated reward of more than 2.3 yuan per labor day.

This number seemed inspiring, but it only had large output increase targets without specific measures to guarantee the increase; some paddy fields that were not suitable for planting double-cropping rice were also included in the plan; the cooperative's staff did not carefully calculate production costs when making the plan. The cooperative members did not believe in this plan, but the cooperative's leaders felt very satisfied with this paper-based production increase plan.

In January of this year, when the cooperative's management committee further reviewed the plan, problems emerged. First, there was a shortage of funds. According to the funds needed in the plan, there was a shortfall of more than 17,000 yuan, in addition to the investment of cooperative members and state loans. Second, 74 households in the cooperative were short of food, and more households would be short of food between spring and summer. Third, after calculation, the entire cooperative's labor force could provide more than 197,000 labor days, while agricultural production only needed more than 100,800 labor days, leaving more than 89,000 labor days with nothing to do. Fourth, relying solely on agricultural production would reduce the income of more than 100 households, because these households mostly had more land and less labor or lacked full labor force.

Faced with these four major difficulties, the cooperative's Party branch specifically convened a branch meeting to study ways to overcome the difficulties. Luo Zhixing, the cooperative's director, was concerned that the agricultural production increase plan was too large, and feared that sideline occupations would not be successful, which would affect agriculture. Some Party members believed that as long as agriculture was done well, they would "never run out of food or use," and there was no need to engage in sideline occupations. Party member Yuan Jianru made an even simpler suggestion: "As long as we get a loan of 40,000 yuan from the government, all problems will be solved." Yin Wanxiang, the deputy secretary of the branch, resolutely advocated that sideline occupations could not be abandoned in his speech. He cited the experience of increasing income by developing sideline occupations when running the primary cooperative last year.

Yin Wanxiang's speech led Party members to recall that the reason why the five primary cooperatives increased their income by more than 10,000 yuan last year (sideline occupations accounted for 15% of the total income of the five cooperatives' agriculture and sideline occupations) was an important reason was that they implemented diversified operations. Due to the development of diversified operations, the five cooperatives found outlets for more than 6,600 surplus labor days last year, ensuring that semi-labor forces who could not participate in agricultural production all increased their income. Among them, the Shude Agricultural Production Cooperative raised 57 fat pigs, not only overfulfilling the state's task of purchasing live pigs, but also solved the problem of fertilizer shortage for more than 200 mu of land in the cooperative.

After this branch meeting, the Lanhe Agricultural Production Cooperative overcame the ideas of some people who simply relied on government loans and were satisfied with agricultural production increase targets while neglecting sideline occupations, revised the agricultural production plan, and comprehensively formulated the agricultural and sideline production plan.

In the agricultural plan, the paddy fields that could not grow double-cropping rice were reduced, and now only 3,500 mu of double-cropping rice are planted. In dry land, economic crops such as sesame, peanuts, and jute have been increased. After revising the plan in this way, each labor day can get a reward of 1.2 yuan in agriculture, which is less than the original plan, but more reliable.

This cooperative is located in a small market town on the side of the Yuehan Railway. Farmers can increase their income by working as temporary workers on the railway, transporting goods for the supply and marketing cooperative, and helping the warehouse sort and process rice. In addition, there is wasteland nearby that can be reclaimed, the cooperative can raise a large number of pigs, and can also burn kilns, raise fish, raise ducks, plant fruit trees and afforest.

This cooperative's sideline occupation plan is formulated in accordance with the principle of small investment and large returns, which not only takes into account immediate cash income (such as transportation, temporary work, etc.), but also lays the foundation for diversified operations in the future. For example, the cooperative planted 1,200 pear trees, ten mu of mulberry trees, 30,000 camellia trees, and raised 30,000 fish, etc. Although these production undertakings will not receive benefits in the short term, the investment is not large, and after a few years, there will be a large income every year. Someone once suggested opening a oil press and raising fifteen dairy cows, but the management committee believed that this suggestion was not practical and did not adopt it. In terms of time arrangement for operating agriculture and sideline occupations, efforts are also made to focus on agriculture and sideline occupations do not affect agriculture. For example, boiling saltpeter can quickly get cash income, and the mud boiled out can fertilize the fields, so it is carried out early before rice transplanting. As for burning kilns, because it requires a lot of labor, it is arranged to be carried out after autumn.

The Lanhe Agricultural Production Cooperative is a large cooperative with 705 member households. Such a large cooperative must rationally organize the labor force to carry out diversified operations. This cooperative has adopted three methods to solve this problem. One is to contract various farm work to the production team in a unified manner, such as reclamation, planting camellia trees, etc.; one is to determine a special person to be responsible, such as raising pigs, raising ducks, etc.; and one is to temporarily organize sideline occupation groups, such as rice milling, transportation, temporary work, etc. The management committee has also formulated a sideline occupation production quota contracting method.

Since February, this cooperative has correctly implemented the policy of diversified operations. Now, most of the rice seedlings in the cooperative's more than 5,000 mu of paddy fields have been transplanted, and the transplanting is half a month earlier than in previous years. The tillage quality of the fields has reached the prescribed standards. During this period, the cooperative's sideline occupation income also reached more than 4,700 yuan in cash. From February to April, the monthly income was more than 1,000 yuan; in early May, the income was 680 yuan. The cooperative extracted more than 2,000 yuan from these incomes and invested it in agricultural production to purchase fertilizers and agricultural tools, successfully solving the problem of lack of funds. 236 households of impoverished cooperative members in the cooperative received more than 2,400 yuan in advance from the cooperative, overcoming the current living difficulties.

The Lanhe Agricultural Cooperative originally had more than 60 relatively wealthy cooperative members who were worried about reduced income after joining the advanced cooperative and were emotionally uneasy. Now, they are relieved to see that the cooperative has so much income. In just a few months, the cooperative members have done more than 3,000 labor days in sideline occupation production alone.

    他们社里月月有收入
    袁旦初
    湖南省岳阳县栏河农业生产合作社（高级社），在去年十二月份初步制定了今年农业生产计划。要扩种四千多亩双季稻，预计每个劳动日可以得到二元三角多的报酬。
    这个数字看来是鼓舞人心的，可是，它光有大的增产指标，没有保证增产的具体措施；有些不适合种双季稻的水田，也订上了种双季稻的计划；社的工作人员在订计划的时候，也没有详细核算生产成本。社员们不相信这个计划，合作社的领导人员却对这个纸上的增产计划感到很满足。
    今年一月，当社管委会进一步审查计划，问题就出来了。首先是资金不足，按计划上需要的资金，除了社员投资和国家贷款外，还缺一万七千多元。其次是社内有七十四户社员缺口粮，到春夏之间，还会有更多的户缺口粮。第三，经过计算，全社的劳动力可以做十九万七千多个劳动日，而农业生产只要十万零八千多个劳动日就够了，剩下的八万九千多个劳动日没事做。第四，单靠农业生产，就有一百多户社员要减少收入，因为这些户原来大多是田多劳力少或缺乏全劳动力的。
    面对这四大困难，合作社的党支部专门召开了支部大会，研究克服困难的办法。社主任罗志兴顾虑农业增产计划大，怕副业搞不好，会影响农业。有的党员认为只要搞好农业就“吃不完、用不完”，不必再搞副业。党员袁健如提的更简单：“只要向政府贷款四万元，一切问题都解决了。”支部副书记尹晚湘在发言中，坚决主张副业不能放弃，他举出去年办初级社的时候由于开展副业而增加了收入的经验。
    尹晚湘的发言引导党员回忆了去年五个初级社所以增加了一万多元的收入（副业占五个社农、副业总收入的15％），一个重要原因是它们实行了多种经营。由于开展多种经营，去年五个社替六千六百多个剩余劳动日找到了出路，保证不能参加农业生产的半劳动力都增加了收入。其中树德农业生产合作社喂了五十七头肥猪，不但超额完成了国家派购生猪的任务，也解决了社内二百多亩田的缺肥问题。
    经过这一次支部大会，栏河农业生产合作社克服了一部分人的单纯依赖政府贷款和满足于农业增产指标、轻视副业的思想，修订了农业生产计划，全面地制定了农副业生产计划。
    在农业计划上，把不能种双季稻的水田削减了，现在只种三千五百亩双季稻。在旱地里，增加了芝麻、花生、黄麻等经济作物。这样修订计划以后，每个劳动日在农业上可得到一元二角的报酬，虽然比原来计划的少些，但是更加可靠了。
    这个社在粤汉路边的一个小集镇上，农民在铁路上做临时工，替供销社运输货物，帮仓库整理加工米，都可以增加收入。此外，附近有荒地可以开垦，社内能大量养猪，也能烧窑、养鱼、养鸭、种植果树和造林。
    这个社的副业计划，是依照投资小、收益大的原则制定的，既照顾到眼前有现金收入（如运输、做临时工等），也为以后的多种经营打下了基础。比如社里种了一千二百株梨树、十亩桑树、三万株油茶树，养了三万尾鱼等。这些生产事业眼前虽收不到利益，但是投资不大，几年之后，每年都将有很大的收入。有人曾经建议开一座榨房和喂十五条乳牛，管委会认为这个意见不切合实际，就没有采纳。在经营农、副业的时间安排上，也尽力做到以农业为主，副业不影响农业。如熬硝既能很快得到现金收入，熬出来的泥巴，又可肥田，就提早在插秧前进行。至于烧窑，因为需要的人工多，就安排到秋后进行。
    栏河农业生产合作社是一个拥有705户社员的大社。这样的大社要进行多种经营，必须合理地组织劳动力。这个社是采取三种办法来解决这个问题的，一种是把各种农活统一包工到生产队，如开荒、种油茶树等；一种是确定专人负责，如养猪，养鸭等，一种是临时组织副业小组，如碾米、运输、做临时工等。管委会也制定了一个副业生产定额包工的办法。
    从二月份起，这个社正确地执行了多种经营的方针。现在，全社五千多亩水田的秧苗已经大部分插下去了，插秧比往年提早了半个月。田地的耕作质量都达到规定的标准。在这期间，社里的副业收入也达到四千七百多元现金。从二月到四月，每月收入有一千多元；在五月上旬，收入了六百八十元。合作社从这些收入中，抽出二千多元投入农业生产，购买肥料和农具，顺利地解决了缺乏资金的问题。社里有236户生活贫困的社员，从社里预支到二千四百多元，克服了眼前的生活困难。
    栏河农业合作社原来有六十多户比较富裕的社员，怕入高级社后减少收入，情绪不安。现在，他们看到合作社有这样多的收入，也安心了。在短短的几个月内，社员们仅在副业生产上，就做了三千多个劳动日。
