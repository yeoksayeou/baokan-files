Already Beyond Saving
To the Editors:

We write to you in grief and indignation to report that our child, Wan Hua, tragically passed away due to the irresponsible actions of certain medical staff at the Beijing Children's Hospital.

Wan Hua contracted pneumonia on February 4th and was immediately admitted to Beijing Children's Hospital for treatment. His pneumonia improved shortly thereafter. At this point, the attending physician, Wang Jingyu, decided to put him on a semi-liquid diet. Wan Hua was only eleven and a half months old when he was admitted and had never eaten semi-liquid food before. In addition, his digestive capacity was weakened due to just recovering from pneumonia. As a result, he could not digest the noodles and wontons he was given at all. We raised our concerns several times after learning about this situation, but the doctor and nurses paid no attention. On February 15th, Wan Hua had diarrhea five times in one day due to indigestion. Although his diet was changed to liquid food the next day, and then to semi-soupy food the day after that, the diarrhea and vomiting continued unabated.

Wan Hua's health continued to deteriorate. Although the hospital provided some treatment, his condition did not improve. On the morning of March 8th, the child's temperature rose to 38.7 degrees Celsius. We went to find Dr. Wang Jingyu, who said nonchalantly, "Just drink more boiled water, and it will be fine!" We then went to find the attending physician, Pei Li, who thought a lukewarm bath would improve his condition. However, the child's temperature reached 39 degrees after the lukewarm bath. Dr. Pei Li still did not conduct an examination and simply asked the nurse to give the child a sedative injection. At 1:00 PM, the child still had a fever, and Dr. Pei Li finally came to examine him. Although she discovered that the child's white blood cell count was already very high, she merely gave him an aspirin tablet and left it at that. At 5:30 PM, the child's condition worsened, and we again asked Dr. Pei Li to diagnose and treat him as soon as possible. She only said, "Okay, I'll talk to the on-duty doctor tonight!" However, he did not receive any treatment that night. At 5:00 AM on March 9th, the child's fever reached 41.5 degrees Celsius. We went to the director of medical affairs to seek emergency treatment, but it was too late, and our child died under these circumstances.

A children's hospital should be an institution that safeguards the health of the motherland's second generation. But why did these staff members at the Beijing Children's Hospital adopt such a cold and indifferent attitude towards the child's life and safety? We request that the Beijing Public Health Bureau conduct a thorough investigation and seriously address this issue.

The Bitter Fruit of Violating Operating Procedures
To the Editors:

At noon on April 2nd, Comrade Huo Yongchang's daughter, Xiao Fen, from our office (the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee) sadly passed away!

Xiao Fen was only two years old and was a lively and sensible child. On the afternoon of April 1st, she broke the skin on her head, and the comrades in the office's health clinic applied medicine and bandaged it. In order to help Xiao Fen's wound heal faster, Huo Yongchang took her to the Zhongnanhai Clinic directly under the Ministry of Health for treatment the next day. Tan Maosheng, the surgeon at the clinic, decided to inject her with tetanus antitoxin. According to regulations, a sensitivity test must be performed before injecting tetanus antitoxin to avoid adverse consequences. However, Tan Maosheng believed that people with special constitutions were rare, so he injected Xiao Fen with 1,500 units of tetanus antitoxin without conducting a sensitivity test. As a result, Xiao Fen started acting like she was crazy before she even left the clinic; then, she developed facial swelling, cyanosis all over her body, and incontinence. Tan Maosheng rushed to give her emergency treatment, but Xiao Fen's life ended within minutes!

The autopsy of Xiao Fen's body by doctors at the Beijing Medical College proved that she had symptoms of lymphatic hyperplasia and thymus enlargement and could not be injected with tetanus antitoxin.

The occurrence of this incident is by no means accidental. In the past, Tan Maosheng had injected patients with tetanus antitoxin several times without conducting a sensitivity test. Xiao Fen's precious life became a sacrifice for his behavior of violating medical operating procedures. Carelessness leads to death, and this is a painful lesson!

### 杜绝医疗事故，更好地为病人服务

    杜绝医疗事故，更好地为病人服务
    万华已经救不活了编辑同志：
    我们悲愤地向你们申诉：我们的孩子万华，由于北京市儿童医院某些医务人员工作中不负责任而不幸去世了。
    万华在二月四日得了肺炎，当时就被送到北京市儿童医院住院治疗。不久，他的肺炎好转了。这时，住院大夫王靖宇就决定让他吃半流质的食物。万华入院时才十一个半月，从来没有吃过半流质食物，加上肺炎刚好，消化力比过去减弱了。因此，他吃了面片和馄饨，根本消化不了。我们知道这种情况以后，曾经几次提出意见，但是大夫和护士都不加考虑。二月十五日，万华因为消化不良而一天拉了五次；第二天虽然改吃流质食物，第三天又改吃半汤的食物，但是泻、吐现象仍有加无已。
    万华的健康情况越来越恶化。院方虽然作了一些治疗；但是，他的情况并没有好转。三月八日上午，孩子的体温增高到三十八度七。我们去找王靖宇大夫，她不关心地说，“多喝点开水就好了！”我们又去找主治大夫裴立，她认为温水浴后就会好转。但是，孩子经过温水浴以后，体温就达到三十九度。裴立大夫仍然没有进行检查，只叫护士给孩子打一针镇静剂。下午一点，孩子还没有退烧，裴立大夫才来做了检查。当时她虽然发现孩子的白血球数量已经很高，可是仅仅让吃一片阿司匹灵就算了。下午五时半孩子病情更重了，我们又请裴立大夫及早诊治，她只说：“好，我和晚上的值班大夫说一说！”但是，当天晚上根本没有得到任何治疗。三月九日早上五点钟，孩子烧到四十一度半，我们去请医务主任设法急救，但是时间已经晚了，我们的孩子就在这种情况下死去了。
    儿童医院应该是保障祖国第二代的健康的一个机构。但是北京市儿童医院的这些工作人员为什么对孩子的生命安全采取了这样冷酷和漠不关心的态度呢？我们要求北京市公共卫生局深入检查并且严肃处理这个问题。

    违反操作规程的恶果编辑同志：
    四月二日中午，我们机关（中共中央宣传部）收发室霍永常同志的女儿小芬不幸逝世了！
    小芬今年才两岁多，是一个活泼懂事的孩子。四月一日下午，她头上碰破了一块皮，当时机关保健室的同志就给她上药包扎了。霍永常为了使小芬的伤口早点复原，第二天领她到卫生部直属中南海门诊部去治疗。门诊部的外科医师谈茂生决定给她注射破伤风抗毒素。按规定，在注射破伤风抗毒素以前必须经过敏感试验，以免造成不良后果。但是谈茂生认为特异体质的人很少，不进行敏感试验就给小芬注射了一千五百单位的破伤风抗毒素。结果，小芬还没离开门诊部，就像发了疯似地闹起来；接着又出现了面部浮肿、全身发青、大小便失禁等迹象。谈茂生赶快去急救，但是小芬的生命在几分钟的时间内就结束了！
    小芬的尸体经过北京医学院大夫的解剖，证明她有淋巴腺增生和胸腺扩大的症状，是不能注射破伤风抗毒素的。
    事情的发生决不是偶然的。在过去，谈茂生就曾好几次没有经过敏感试验就给病人注射了破伤风抗毒素。小芬的宝贵生命，就成为他这种违反医疗操作规程的行为的牺牲品。粗枝大叶害死人，这就是一个惨痛的教训！
