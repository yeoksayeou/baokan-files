Agricultural cooperatives in Echeng County, Hubei Province, have launched production competitions. The broad masses of cooperative members have displayed labor enthusiasm and creativity in the competition. When planting cotton, the first cooperative of the Xuguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dushan Township and the Wuyi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinjie Township created the "two-hand planting method," increasing labor productivity by 40% to 50%. In the second and third production teams of the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Miaoling Township, out of 184 male and female laborers, the original daily attendance rate was only 42.5%, but it increased to 98% after the competition. Currently, agricultural production cooperatives in various regions are carrying out competition activities centered on comparing field preparation, fertilizer application, and rice transplanting standards.

    农业合作社开展生产竞赛
    湖北省鄂城县有一千多个农业生产合作社开展了生产竞赛。广大社员在竞赛运动中发挥了劳动积极性和创造性。杜山乡旭光农业生产合作社第一社和新界乡五一农业生产合作社播种棉花的时候创造了“双手播种法”，提高劳动生产率40％到50％。庙岭乡红光农业生产合作社第二、三生产队有男女劳动力184人，原来每天出勤率只有42.5％，竞赛以后提高到98％。目前，各地农业生产合作社正以比整田、比施肥、比插秧规格等为中心开展竞赛运动。（本报驻武汉记者）
