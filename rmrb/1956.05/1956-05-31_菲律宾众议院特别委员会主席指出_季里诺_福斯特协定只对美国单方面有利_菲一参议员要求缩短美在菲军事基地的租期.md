Xinhua News Agency, May 30th: According to a report in the "Manila Times" on May 26th, Arturo Tolentino, chairman of the special committee of the Philippine House of Representatives responsible for re-examining Philippine-US relations, emphasized on May 25th that there is an urgent need to re-evaluate the Quirino-Foster Agreement signed between the Philippines and the United States in 1950. He believes that the implementation of this agreement is "unilateral" and detrimental to the Philippines.

Tolentino said that according to this agreement, "Filipinos cannot carry out any projects they wish to carry out unless they obtain the consent of the Americans."

He said that from 1951 to 1955, the United States provided a total of 99 million US dollars for the construction of the projects stipulated in the agreement, and the Philippines also contributed 221 million pesos (two pesos to one US dollar). These funds were used for projects that attempted to maintain a permanent agricultural economy in the country. Only three million US dollars and thirteen million pesos were used for industrial and mining projects. Nothing has been done to promote industries that can manufacture consumer goods and compete with American products.

He cited the food department of the Bureau of Animal Industry as an example, saying, "Although assistance was given to the agricultural economy, no help was given to developing cheese factories to produce milk. Why? Because abundant milk production in the Philippines would pose a serious threat to milk imported from the United States."

Xinhua News Agency, May 30th, Manila: Philippine Senate Defense and Security Committee member Conlleon filed a motion in the Senate on May 29th, demanding that the lease term of US military bases in the Philippines be shortened from 99 years to 20 years. The senator said that he has received unconditional support from some senators, including Laurel and Recto.

Conlleon also said that the Philippine delegation, which is about to negotiate the 1947 Philippine-US Military Base Agreement with the United States, should make the following demands to the US delegation: First, the Philippines should have jurisdiction over these bases; second, the US authorities should not remove the additional equipment on the bases when the lease expires.

The Philippine-US negotiations are scheduled to be held when the new US Ambassador Newfell arrives in the Philippines. He is the head of the US delegation. (Attached picture)

    菲律宾众议院特别委员会主席指出
    季里诺—福斯特协定只对美国单方面有利
    菲一参议员要求缩短美在菲军事基地的租期
    据新华社30日讯　据五月二十六日的“马尼拉时报”报道，负责重新审查菲美关系的菲律宾众议院特别委员会主席阿图罗·托伦蒂诺在五月二十五日强调指出，目前迫切需要重新估价菲律宾同美国在1950年签订的季里诺—福斯特协定，他认为这项协定的执行是“单方面的”，是对菲律宾不利的。
    托伦蒂诺说，根据这项协定，“除非得到美国人的同意，否则菲律宾人是不能够进行他们所希望进行的任何工程的”。
    他说，从1951年到1955年，为建设协定中规定的工程，美国提供了总计九千九百万美元的经费，菲律宾也拿出了两亿两千一百万比索（两比索合一美元）。这些款项都被用在一些企图在这个国家永远保持农业经济的工程上。只有三百万美元和一千三百万比索用在工矿工程上。在促进能够制造消费品和能够同美国产品竞争的工业方面，什么事情也没有做。
    他举畜牧局的食品部门为例说，“虽然对农业经济是给予了援助，但是对于发展奶酪场来生产牛奶这件事却一直没有给予任何帮助。为什么呢？因为菲律宾的牛奶生产充足以后将会给从美国进口的牛奶造成严重的威胁。”
    新华社30日讯　马尼拉消息：菲律宾参议院国防和安全委员会委员康莱昂五月二十九日在参议院提出动议，要求把美国在菲律宾的军事基地的租期从九十九年缩短到二十年。这位参议员说，他已经得到的一些参议员的无条件的支持，其中有劳雷尔和雷克托。
    康莱昂还说，即将同美国谈判1947年的菲美军事基地协定的菲律宾代表团，应该向美国代表团提出下列要求：第一，菲律宾应该对这些基地有管辖权；第二，美国当局在租期满期的时候不应该把基地上增加的设备搬走。
    菲美谈判预订在美国新大使纽弗尔到达菲律宾的时候举行，他是美国代表团的团长。（附图片）
