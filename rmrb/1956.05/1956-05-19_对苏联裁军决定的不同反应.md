    Different Reactions to the Soviet Disarmament Decision
    Thai Foreign Minister Says Soviet Disarmament is a Contribution to World Peace
    Bangkok News: Thai Foreign Minister Naradhip said to reporters in Bangkok on May 17th that the Soviet Union's disarmament decision was "a positive contribution to world peace."
    The Foreign Minister said that the Soviet disarmament was sincere because the Soviet Union needed to vigorously develop its industry.
    Naradhip believes that other countries may later use the Soviet example as a basis for disarmament.
    British Labour Party Members of Parliament Call for Revision of Cold War Policy
    According to Reuters, London: Fifty-five British Labour Party members of parliament jointly issued a statement on the evening of the 17th, welcoming the Soviet government's decision to reduce its armed forces by 1.2 million people.
    The statement called on the British government to revise Britain's "Cold War objectives so that they are suitable for solutions to European and Asian problems based on peaceful coexistence and the United Nations."
    The statement said, "The Soviet (disarmament) decision has created a new situation of vital importance to the future of mankind, because it has shown that the challenge of communism is economic, social and political, not military."
    Eden Welcomes Soviet Disarmament Decision
    But Reiterates Western Preconditions
    London News: British Prime Minister Eden said in the House of Commons on the 17th in response to questions that the British government welcomed the Soviet decision to reduce its armed forces.
    At the same time, Eden rejected the suggestion made by Labour MP Warbey that a new Four-Power summit be held to remove obstacles to reaching an agreement on universal, supervised large-scale disarmament. Eden said that Britain hoped to make full use of the United Nations Disarmament Commission to achieve disarmament.
    Agence France-Presse reported that Eden reiterated the Western countries' position of setting preconditions for disarmament. He said: Some political problems must be resolved first before disarmament can make progress beyond a certain point.
    U.S. Military Advocates Continuing Arms Expansion
    New York Stock Market Drops Sharply but then Stabilizes
    New York News: The reaction of U.S. military leaders to the Soviet government's disarmament decision shows that powerful groups in the United States do not intend to take concrete steps to respond to this new Soviet peace initiative, and advocate that the United States step up its arms expansion.
    According to an Associated Press correspondent in Washington, U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson said at a press conference that the Soviet government's statement was "a step in the right direction," but he also said that this step "is not sufficient to justify the United States also reducing its armed forces." Wilson once again insisted on adopting the U.S. proposal on aerial photography, which has nothing to do with reducing armaments or establishing supervision over disarmament. In order to defend the U.S. arms expansion, Wilson spread a ridiculous rumour that the Soviet Union harboured "aggressive intentions" towards the United States.
    According to some reporters and observers, the main purpose of U.S. military leaders announcing that the United States will continue to expand its armaments is to stabilize the New York stock market, because the Soviet government's decision had caused great panic here. On May 14, stock prices on the stock exchange fell sharply, and the decline continued until the 15th. According to Associated Press financial commentator Wengert, Wall Street was uneasy, fearing that the Soviet government's statement "would cause people to demand more strongly that the United States relax its efforts in terms of armaments." The Associated Press reported that after U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and leaders of the Department of Defense announced that they did not intend to let the United States relax its military efforts, the situation on the exchange gradually stabilized.

    对苏联裁军决定的不同反应
    泰国外交部长说苏联裁军是对世界和平的贡献
    曼谷消息：泰国外交部长那拉底五月十七日在曼谷对记者们谈话的时候说：苏联的裁军决定是“对世界和平的一个肯定的贡献”。
    这位外交部长说，苏联裁军是真心诚意的，因为苏联需要大力发展工业。
    那拉底认为其他国家可能会在以后把苏联的事例作为裁军的基础。
    英工党议员要求修改冷战政策
    据路透社伦敦消息：英国五十五位工党议员在十七日晚联合发表一个声明，欢迎苏联政府宣布裁减武装部队一百二十万人的决定。
    声明要求英国政府修改英国的“冷战目的，以便使它们适合于以和平共处和联合国为基础的欧洲和亚洲问题的解决办法”。
    声明说，“苏联的（裁军）决定已经创造了一种对于人类的将来有着切身重要意义的新局面，因为它已表明，共产主义的挑战是经济、社会和政治方面的，而不是军事方面的。”
    艾登欢迎苏联裁军决定
    但又重申西方的先决条件
    伦敦消息：英国首相艾登十七日在下院回答问题的时候说，英国政府欢迎苏联裁减武装部队的决定。
    同时，艾登拒绝了工党议员华贝的建议，这个建议主张举行一次新的四大国高级会议，来排除就普遍的、有监督的大规模裁军缔结协定的障碍。艾登说，英国希望充分利用联合国的裁军委员会来实现裁军。
    法新社消息说：艾登重申了西方国家为裁军规定先决条件的立场。他说：必须先取得一些政治问题的解决，裁军才可能有超过一定程度的进展。
    美国军方鼓吹继续扩军
    纽约股票剧跌后又趋平稳
    纽约消息：美国军事领袖对苏联政府裁军决定的反应说明，美国有势力的集团不打算采取具体步骤来回答苏联这一新的和平倡议，并且主张美国加紧扩充军备。
    据美联社驻华盛顿记者报道，美国国防部长威尔逊在记者招待会上说，苏联政府的声明是“一个方向正确的步骤”，但是，他同时又说，这一步骤“并不足以说明美国也应该裁减武装部队”。威尔逊再次坚持主张采纳美国的同裁减军备和对裁军建立监督毫不相干的关于空中摄影的建议。为了替美国的扩充军备辩护，威尔逊散布一种无稽谰言，说是苏联对美国怀有“侵略意图”。
    据某些记者和观察家的意见，美国军事领袖所以宣布美国将继续扩充军备，主要目的是为了要稳定纽约股票市场，因为苏联政府的决定曾经在这里引起极大的恐慌。五月十四日证券交易所的股票行市急剧下跌，跌风一直继续到十五日。据美联社金融评论员温格特说，华尔街人士在心神不安，害怕苏联政府的声明“会引起人们更强烈地要求美国放松在军备方面的努力”。美联社报道，在美国国务卿杜勒斯和国防部领导人宣布他们不打算让美国放松军事方面的努力之后，交易所的行市情况就渐渐平稳了起来。　（据新华社讯）
