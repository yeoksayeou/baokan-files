    Many Factories and Mines in Chongqing
    Management Personnel Join the Advanced Producer Movement
    The staff in the department offices of many factories and mines in Chongqing actively participate in the advanced producer movement.
    In the past, the finance section of Tianfu Coal Mine could only send out the monthly production cost report on the ninth day of the following month, and the quality was not good. Now, when the workshops are busy calculating wages at the beginning of the month, they send people down to assist, and at the same time, they make reasonable arrangements for the work within the section. As a result, the production cost report is sent out in advance on the sixth day of the following month. This is something that has never happened before in this section. The staff of the Technical Supply Department of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company took the initiative to go deep into the workshops to improve their work in the advanced producer movement. Chu Haiwen, a staff member of the planning section of the department, went deep into the workshop and found that the manganese iron consumption quota for steelmaking in small steelmaking workshops was twice as high as that in large open-hearth workshops. He took the initiative to discuss with the workshop engineer to find ways to reduce the consumption quota. (Sun Yang)

    重庆市许多厂矿
    管理人员投入先进生产者运动
    重庆市许多厂矿的科室管理部门的职工，积极投入先进生产者运动。
    天府煤矿财务科过去每月的生产成本报表要在次月九日才能送出，质量也不好。现在他们在月初车间计算工资忙的时候，派人下去协助，同时把科内的工作作了合理的安排，结果使生产成本报表提前在次月六日送出。这是这个科从来没有过的事情。重庆钢铁公司技术供应处职工在先进生产者运动中，主动深入车间改进工作。这个处计划科的工作人员储海文深入车间发现小型炼钢车间炼钢锰铁消耗定额比大型平炉车间高一倍，他就主动和车间工程师研究，设法降低了消耗定额。    （孙阳）
