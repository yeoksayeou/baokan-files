Scientific research work must have sufficient books and materials. Therefore, as we march towards science today, library work must be well-prepared. The National Library, the Library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and university libraries bear the primary responsibility in scientific research and should be even better prepared.

To improve library work, first, the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Culture, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences must strengthen their leadership over affiliated libraries and clearly define the future tasks of the National Library, the Library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and university libraries. In the future, the National Library should focus on serving scientific research, giving full play to its role as a reference library. General social services such as children's reading, exhibitions, bookmobiles, and street lending are best left to city libraries.

The work of university libraries has faced many unresolved problems in recent years. Libraries are generally used as student study rooms, and the purchase of books is mostly limited to textbooks. In some libraries, more than half of the collection consists of textbooks. There is often an emphasis on teaching while neglecting scientific research. Consequently, some universities even rank libraries behind kindergartens in basic construction projects. We believe that there should be no fundamental conflict between scientific research and teaching in universities. In the future, university libraries must also undertake the task of serving scientific research, rather than just serving as student study rooms, stocking only textbooks, and only completing teaching tasks.

Second, the National Library and university libraries should systematically and methodically acquire important books related to scientific research. In the past, the acquisition of books by libraries mostly lacked planning, and purchases were made opportunistically. Some relied solely on bookstore advertisements. This approach to acquiring books cannot create a systematic or comprehensive collection. Although the collection may appear impressive with millions of volumes, a thorough inspection reveals numerous deficiencies. For example, the study of Mongolian history and Yuan history is a crucial yet weak area in our historical science research today. However, the works of Rashid-al-Din Hamadani, Juvayni, and Berezin, which are first-class historical materials for the study of Mongolian and Yuan history, are not available in any of our libraries. Without these books, how can we conduct research? This example illustrates a broader problem.

To systematically and methodically acquire important books related to scientific research within a few years, I suggest that while formulating the Twelve-Year Science Plan, scientists in each discipline must also compile a list of essential and indispensable books in their field (specifying the best editions, publication locations, publication dates, and their relative importance). The National Library and the Library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences should then develop a plan based on the lists provided by the experts and purchase them annually to ensure comprehensive coverage. University libraries can select important items from these lists according to the nature and tasks of their respective institutions. If foreign language books are not available on the foreign market, they should be photographed or microfilmed from major foreign libraries.

Many books related to scientific research are in foreign languages, so we must improve the import of foreign language books. Here, we hope that the International Bookstore will improve its work. The International Bookstore has done a lot of work in recent years, which should be affirmed, but it is not good enough, which cannot be denied. If it does not improve its work, it will not be able to meet the needs.

Third, the state should consider establishing a specialized science and technology periodical library. Important scientific inventions in modern times are first published in journals, so the acquisition of journals is extremely important, especially complete sets of journals. In recent years, because we do not have such a library, the National Library, the Library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and various university libraries have been doing their own thing, subscribing to foreign language journals separately. This has led to two situations: one is duplication between institutions, wasting a lot of foreign exchange; the other is that with dispersed funding, each unit can only buy a limited number of journals. If a specialized science and technology periodical library is established to collect important journals in all scientific fields from all over the world for photocopying, reprinting, and circulation, other libraries will only need to acquire a few necessary titles. With such a library, we can engage in scientific intelligence work and constantly understand the world's advanced scientific levels.

To implement the second and third suggestions, a large sum of money will naturally be required. However, spending this money is worthwhile because it will lay a solid foundation for scientific research. In recent years, the funding for the National Library and university libraries has not been sufficient. In the future, we should have a broader vision and make more long-term plans. When we buy books, we should play chess like a master, seeing several years ahead, instead of only focusing on the present.

Now I would like to say a few words about the work of the library itself.

We are racing against time today and cannot waste it. The use and circulation of library collections must also be accelerated. I believe the following points should be considered by libraries when serving scientific research:

First, change old working methods and speed up and simplify book cataloging procedures. In the past, libraries had many outdated rules and regulations, which were reflected in the cumbersome and slow cataloging process. Today, libraries must break these rules and regulations, speed up cataloging, and liberate books from their confinement.

Second, the National Library, the Library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and university libraries should elevate reference work to its proper status. Compile union catalogs of books of a certain type or on a certain topic held in major libraries, specialized catalogs, indexes of thematic papers, indexes of monographs, and indexes of various periodicals. Edit book newsletters, scientific and technical abstracts, and book review abstracts. Cooperate with publishers to photograph or reprint important or rare books in the collection. These measures are urgently needed for scientific research.

Third, revise the book lending system. Such as strengthening interlibrary loan methods; delivering books to the hands of scientific researchers, saving them as much time as possible in traveling back and forth, queuing, and waiting; appropriately relaxing the standards for book lending, etc.

Fourth, the National Library, the Library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and university libraries should provide appropriate conditions for scientific researchers. In the past, the National Library's service to scientific researchers was very inadequate. As for university libraries, they have not considered reading seats for teachers in the library for several years, and the object of service for teaching seems to be limited to students. This situation must be changed in the future. The National Library should quickly prepare a considerable number of research rooms for scientific researchers. University libraries should prepare dedicated reading rooms and research rooms for teachers. The Library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences should also be open to scientists outside the academy.

However, today the situation of insufficient housing for the National Library, the Library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and many university libraries is extremely serious. Millions of books are sleeping in boxes and cannot be put on shelves, and there are not enough reading seats, resulting in overcrowding. The construction of new buildings for the National Library, the Library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and some university libraries, which are large in scale, should be put on the agenda of basic construction projects as soon as possible and should not be delayed any longer.

Finally, efforts should be made to strengthen the training of library cadres, especially those serving in the National Library, the Library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and university libraries. The knowledge of books possessed by cadres trained in the past is still insufficient, and should be greatly improved.

Under the great call to march towards science, libraries bear a significant responsibility. We should pay attention to this matter, do this work well, and create favorable conditions for the development of scientific research!

    科学研究工作需要充分的图书资料
    向达
    开展科学研究工作，必须要有充分的图书和资料，所以在向科学进军的今天，图书馆的工作不能不准备好，而国家图书馆、科学院图书馆和大学图书馆在科学研究工作中担负着主要的责任，就更应该做好准备。
    为着做好图书馆的工作，第一、高等教育部、教育部、文化部和中国科学院须要加强对于所属图书馆的领导，将国家图书馆、科学院图书馆和大学图书馆今后的任务明确规定下来。今后的国家图书馆应该以服务科学研究为主要任务，充分发挥参考图书馆的作用。儿童阅览、展览会、图书巡回车、街头借阅等等一般性的社会服务，最好是交给市图书馆去办。
    大学图书馆的工作，这几年来有很多问题没有解决，一般以图书馆为学生自修室，采购图书多为教材课本，有些图书馆的藏书，一半以上为教材和课本，采购有关科学研究的图书数量有限。往往强调教学而轻视科学研究，于是有的大学在基本建设方面排队的时候，竟将图书馆排在幼儿园的后面。我们认为在大学里面，科学研究和教学工作基本上不应该有矛盾。今后大学图书馆也必须担负起为科学研究服务的任务，而不应该只限于作学生的自修室，只库藏教材课本，只完成教学任务而已。
    第二、国家图书馆和大学图书馆应该有计划地、有系统地搜购有关科学研究的重要图书。过去的图书馆搜购图书大都缺乏计划，只是碰到就买。有些只凭书店广告。这样搜购图书是不会成体系的，也不会完备的；看起来藏书达几百万册，洋洋大观，深入检查，则有缺这缺那的现象不一而足。举例来说：蒙古史和元史的研究是今天我们历史科学研究中很重要的一个部门，也是很薄弱的一个部门。但是关于拉施特丁、志费尼以及贝勒津等人的著作，为蒙古史和元史研究中头等重要的史料，而我们没有一个图书馆具备这些书籍。书都没有，又何从研究起呢？举此一例，可概其余。
    为了在几年内有系统、有计划地做好搜购有关科学研究的重要图书这一工作，我建议在制定十二年科学规划的同时，每一门的科学家必须将他那一门科学的基本的、最不可少的图书目录一并开出（注明最好的版本和出版地点、出版年日期以及哪些重要哪些次要等等）。国家图书馆和科学院图书馆即按照各科专家所开书目，制定计划分年采购，做到应有尽有。大学图书馆可以按照自己学校的性质和任务，选购其中重要的一部分。外文图书如在国外市场上买不到，应该从国外大图书馆照相或摄制显微照片。
    同开展科学研究有关的图书很多是外文的，因此我们必须做好外文图书的进口工作。说到这里，我们希望国际书店改进工作。几年来国际书店做了不少工作，这是应该肯定的，但是做得不够好，这也是不容讳言的。如不改进工作，那就不能适应需要了。
    第三、国家可以考虑成立一个专门的科学技术期刊图书馆。近代科学上的重要发明，最先都发表在杂志上，所以杂志的搜购甚为重要，尤其是整套的杂志，更是非常重要的。几年来我们因为没有这样的一种图书馆，于是国家图书馆、科学院图书馆以及各大学图书馆各行其是，纷纷定购外文杂志。这样便发生两种情况：一种是彼此之间重见复出，浪费了不少外汇；一种是经费分散，实际上每一单位都买不了多少种。如成立一个专门的科学技术期刊图书馆，置备世界各国各门科学的重要杂志，以供翻照、翻印和流通之用，其他的图书馆只要置备必要的若干种就够了。有了这样的图书馆，才可以从事科学情报工作，才可以经常了解世界的先进科学水平。
    要实施第二、第三两项建议，自然得花一笔大钱。不过花这些钱是值得的，因为从此可以为科学研究打下坚实的基础。几年来国家图书馆和大学图书馆的经费都还不够充裕，以后应该目光放远一点，多作长远打算。我们买书，应该高手下棋，可以看到好几年之后，不要只顾目前。
    以下我想说一点图书馆本身的工作。
    我们今天是同时间赛跑，不能浪费光阴。图书馆藏书的使用和流通也要加速度进行。我以为以下几点是图书馆在为科学研究服务的时候应该考虑的：
    第一、改变旧的工作方法，加快和简化图书编目的手续。过去的图书馆有不少的清规戒律，表现在编目方面的是手续繁多，迟缓惊人。今天图书馆一定得打破这些清规戒律，加快编目的速度，把图书从幽囚中解放出来。
    第二、国家图书馆、科学院图书馆和大学图书馆应该把参考工作提到应有的地位。多编各大图书馆所藏某一类书或某一专题的联合目录，专门目录、专题论文索引、专书索引、各种期刊索引。编辑图书通讯、科学技术文摘、书评文摘。同出版社合作，影印或重印馆藏重要或善本图书。这些措施，对于科学研究都是迫切需要的。
    第三、改定图书出借的制度。如加强馆际借书的办法；把图书送到科学研究工作者的手里，尽量节省他们往返跋涉排队等待的时间；图书出借的尺度适当地放宽等等。
    第四、国家图书馆、科学院图书馆和大学图书馆都应为科学研究工作者提供适当的条件。过去的国家图书馆为科学研究工作者服务是很不够的。至于大学图书馆几年以来就不曾考虑到教师在图书馆的阅览座位，为教学服务的对象似乎只限于学生。这种情形以后一定要予以改变。国家图书馆应该迅速为科学研究工作者准备相当数目的研究室。大学图书馆应该为教师准备专用的阅览室和研究室。科学院图书馆也应该对院外的科学家开放。
    但是今天国家图书馆、科学院图书馆以及好些大学的图书馆房屋不够用的情形异常严重。几百万册的图书在箱子里睡觉无法上架，阅览座位不够，因而拥挤不堪。建筑规模宏大的国家图书馆、科学院图书馆以及某些大学图书馆的新馆舍，亟应提到基本建设的日程上来，不容再缓。
    最后，对于图书馆干部的培养，特别是对在国家图书馆、科学院图书馆以及大学图书馆服务的干部的培养，应该设法加强。过去培养的干部对于图书的知识，还很不够用，应该大大改进。
    在向科学进军的伟大号召之下，图书馆负有相当重大的责任。我们应该重视此事，把这一工作做好，为科学研究工作的开展创造良好的条件！
