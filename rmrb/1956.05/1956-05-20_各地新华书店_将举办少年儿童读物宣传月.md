Various Xinhua bookstores will hold a "Children's Book Promotion Month" from June 1st to 30th.

During the promotion month, Xinhua bookstores in various places will universally carry out supply work for every middle school, primary school, library (room), club, and industrial and mining enterprise with a library (room) in the city (including towns where rural branches are located), as well as every complete primary school and village/town located in the district/township in rural areas, to assist primary schools in widely establishing children's libraries (boxes). In large and medium-sized cities with suitable conditions, new or additional specialized children's book sales departments will also be established; specialized counters and stands for children's books will also be set up in comprehensive sales departments. In rural areas, Xinhua bookstores will also work together with supply and marketing cooperatives to do a good job in supplying children's books, based on the strength of the supply and marketing cooperatives in selling books. In addition, Xinhua bookstores in various places will cooperate with writers' associations (or federations of literary and art circles), newspapers, publishing houses, cultural and educational institutions, women's organizations, libraries, and cultural centers to hold reading report meetings, children's book exhibitions, and get-togethers for writers and readers. Through these activities, they will strengthen the connection between readers and writers, publishing houses and bookstores, and recommend excellent children's books.
