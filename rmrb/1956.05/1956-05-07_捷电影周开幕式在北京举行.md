Wang Lanxi, Director of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, delivered a speech at the meeting. He said that the friendship, cooperation, and cultural exchanges between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples are becoming increasingly frequent and developing. In recent years, in the field of culture, especially in film, Chinese and Czechoslovak filmmakers have cooperated in filming two excellent films reflecting the cultural friendship between the Chinese and Czechoslovak peoples, "People's Hearts Are One" and "Flowers of Friendship Bloom Everywhere." More than twenty Czechoslovak films have been dubbed into Mandarin Chinese and screened in China, and these films have been widely loved by Chinese audiences. For example, the film "Battle Before Dawn" has been seen by more than 7.1 million viewers. Chinese films are also widely screened in Czechoslovakia and are welcomed by the Czechoslovak people.

Wang Lanxi stated that through the extensive and grand screening of this film week and the enthusiastic contact between all members of the Czechoslovak film workers delegation and the Chinese people, the Chinese people's appreciation of Czechoslovak culture and art will be deepened, and the profound friendship between the two peoples will be greatly enhanced.

Jiří Mařik, head of the Czechoslovak film workers delegation, said in his speech that he felt happy that Chinese films had entered the international stage at the international film festival held in Czechoslovakia. Millions of Czechoslovak viewers have come to know China, the struggle and construction of the Chinese people through Chinese films.

Jiří Mařik also said that they knew with the same pride that Czechoslovak films were also welcomed by Chinese audiences. He expressed his happiness that their creative achievements could be beneficial to consolidating the friendship between China and Czechoslovakia.

Xia Yan, Vice Minister of Culture, and responsible persons from relevant departments, people from Chinese film circles and other fields, Cao Ying, Chinese Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, Grigor, Czechoslovak Ambassador to China, and diplomatic envoys from other countries to China, attended the opening ceremony.
