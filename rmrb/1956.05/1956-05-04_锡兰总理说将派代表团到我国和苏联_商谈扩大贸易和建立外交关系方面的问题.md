Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd, Colombo Dispatch: Ceylon Prime Minister Bandaranaike said at a press conference on May 2nd that he intends to send a delegation to the Soviet Union and China in the near future to discuss expanding trade and establishing diplomatic relations.

Bandaranaike said: "My own view has always been that one of the best ways to avoid the danger of war and increase mutual understanding, while acknowledging broad political differences, lies in mutual trade." He said, "I am very happy that this view is now gradually gaining ground."

Bandaranaike said that due to the visit of Soviet leaders to Britain, there is hope for increased British-Soviet trade.

He said that the issue of obtaining assistance from countries other than the United States—including the Soviet Union and China—will soon be studied. He said: He would welcome foreign investment that is most beneficial to Ceylon and does not impose any onerous restrictions on Ceylon's independence.

Bandaranaike also expressed his strong opposition to the continued practice of colonialism in Goa. He said, "I firmly believe that Goa is a colony of Portugal, not a province of Portugal."

He believes that the Kashmir issue and the Goa issue should be resolved by the countries concerned. He hopes that the Goa issue will be resolved amicably in due course, as the issue of France's territories in India was.

Regarding the Algerian issue, Bandaranaike said that Ceylon has notified the French government of its hope that a ceasefire can be implemented in Algeria.

　　锡兰总理说将派代表团到我国和苏联
    商谈扩大贸易和建立外交关系方面的问题
    新华社3日讯　科伦坡消息：锡兰总理班达拉奈克五月二日在记者招待会上说，他打算在不久以后就派代表团到苏联和中国商谈扩大贸易和建立外交关系方面的问题。
    班达拉奈克说：“我自己的看法一向是：在承认广泛的政治上的分歧的情况下，避免战争危险和增加相互谅解的最好方法之一就在于互相贸易方面。”他说：“我很高兴，这种看法现在正在逐渐得势。”
    班达拉奈克说，由于苏联领导人们到英国的访问，英苏贸易有了增加的希望。
    他说，对于从美国以外的国家——包括苏联和中国在内——得到援助的问题，很快即将进行研究。他说：他将欢迎对锡兰最有利而且又不对锡兰的独立加以任何繁重的限制的那种外国投资。
    班达拉奈克还表示他强烈地反对在果阿继续实行殖民主义。他说，“我肯定地认为果阿是葡萄牙的殖民地，而不是葡萄牙的一个省份。”
    他认为克什米尔问题和果阿问题应该由有关国家加以解决。他希望果阿问题将在适当时候像法国在印度的属地的问题那样友好地得到解决。
    关于阿尔及利亚问题，班达拉奈克说，锡兰已经通知法国政府，说明它希望在阿尔及利亚能够实行停火。
