Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 20th - The farmers in the Dongting Lake area have safely passed this year's first flood peak.

Recently, heavy rains have fallen in various parts of Hunan Province. The rainfall in most areas of the upper and middle reaches of the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li rivers reached 100 to 200 millimeters. In some places, the water level rose sharply by two meters in one day. As a result, by the middle of this month, the riverbanks and the tail reaches of the four rivers all exceeded the flood control water level. At this time, the Changde District Flood Control Headquarters immediately issued an emergency order to mobilize flood control efforts. More than 900 flood control cadres and more than 110,000 farmers from various counties in the district went to the dikes overnight to fight the flood. Braving the wind and rain, they patrolled the dikes back and forth with lanterns at night. When they discovered river seepage or dangerous situations, they immediately carried out rescue operations. After about ten days of continuous struggle, they safely overcame the invasion of the first flood peak. Now, the water levels of the dikes along the rivers have generally dropped, and the weather has cleared up. In addition to seizing the time to drain waterlogged areas, the farmers throughout the district are carrying out a comprehensive inspection and repair work in preparation for the major flood season.

    洞庭湖区度过第一次洪峰
    新华社长沙20日电　洞庭湖区农民安全度过了今年第一次洪峰。
    最近，湖南各地普降暴雨，湘，资，沅，澧四水上中游大部分地区的降雨量达一百到二百公厘，有的地方水位一天猛涨两公尺。因此到本月中旬，沿江及四水尾闾都超过了防汛水位以上。这时，常德区的防汛指挥部立即发出动员防汛的紧急命令，全区各县九百多防汛干部和十一万多农民防汛队伍连夜上堤，与洪水展开斗争。他们冒着风雨打起灯笼漏夜在大堤来回巡逻，发现有河浸和出险的地方立即进行抢救。经过十天左右的连续斗争，安全战胜了首次洪峰的侵袭。现在，各河流堤垸的水位已普遍下降，天气转晴，全区农民除抓紧排渍外，正开展大汛前的全面检查和补修工作。
