Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 27th: According to TASS, the Chairman of the Polish State Economic Planning Commission, Mr. Cyrankiewicz, stated that cooperation and mutual assistance between countries of the socialist camp have entered a period characterized by a new and supreme form. Coordinated economic development among nations based on draft multi-year plans for 1956-1960 has become a decisive factor in their cooperation and mutual assistance. Simultaneously, this has created the possibility and necessity for all socialist countries, following the example of the Soviet Union, to begin formulating long-term plans for the development of the national economy, spanning fifteen to twenty years, and to coordinate these plans with each other.

Cyrankiewicz made these remarks in an article published in the Soviet newspaper "Izvestia" discussing the work of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon). The author pointed out that coordinating the long-term plans of countries for several years is of great significance for the further development of cooperation among socialist countries. First, this coordination can ensure a fuller and more rational use of each country's natural wealth and energy resources, in accordance with their own interests and the development interests of the entire peaceful and socialist camp. Second, the specialization and cooperation of production on an international scale will make it possible to reduce the variety of products produced by each country, which will greatly promote the reduction of product costs and the rapid progress of technology. Third, this coordination will help to widely disseminate the latest technological achievements.

Cyrankiewicz said that the socialist world economic system includes a quarter of the world's territory and a third of its population. Socialist countries produce approximately 30% of the world's industrial goods. Given the economic characteristics and differences of each country, the level of development of productive forces, and different geographical and natural conditions, coordinating the economic plans of countries on such a scale is a new issue, an issue of great historical significance. Comecon has been carrying out this work since April of last year.

Cyrankiewicz finally emphasized that Comecon is not an exclusive organization. Countries of the socialist camp advocate the broad development of economic relations with all capitalist countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Countries of the socialist camp are prepared to support any beneficial initiative based on the principles of peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between the two world economic systems. Therefore, the coordination of the multi-year plans and other forms of economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the European People's Democracies does not mean that the economies of these countries are isolated from the capitalist system. The rapid growth of productive forces in the socialist camp does not hinder, but rather promotes the development of trade relations with capitalist countries.

### 波兰计划委员会主席  谈八国协同发展经济的意义

    波兰计划委员会主席
    谈八国协同发展经济的意义
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：波兰国家经济计划委员会主席西尔说：社会主义阵营国家之间的合作和互助进入了以新的最高的形式为特征的时期。各国在1956—1960年的多年计划草案的基础上协同发展经济，成了各国合作和互助中的一个有决定意义的因素。同时产生了这种可能性和必要性：在所有社会主义国家中，仿效苏联的榜样，开始制定为期十五年到二十年的发展国民经济的远景计划，并且使这些计划相互配合。
    西尔是在苏联“消息报”上发表文章谈八国经济互助委员会的工作时谈这番话的。作者指出，使各国若干年的远景计划相互配合，对于进一步发展社会主义国家的合作具有重大的意义。第一、这种配合可以保证根据各个国家的自己利益同整个和平和社会主义阵营发展的利益来更充分和更合理地使用各个国家的自然财富和动力资源。第二、在国际规模上的生产专业化和合作化将有可能减少每一个国家出产的产品种类，这就能促进产品成本的大大减低和技术的迅速进步。第三、这种配合将有助于广泛推广最新的技术成就。
    西尔说，社会主义世界经济体系包括着全世界的四分之一的领土和三分之一的人口。社会主义国家出产的工业品约占世界工业品的30％。鉴于每一个国家的经济的特征和不同点、生产力的发展水平以及不同的地理条件和自然条件，在这样的规模上使各国经济计划相互配合就是一个新的问题，一个具有重大历史意义的问题。经济互助委员会从去年四月起就开始进行了这种工作。
    西尔最后着重指出，经济互助委员会并不是一个排他组织。社会主义阵营国家主张同所有资本主义国家在平等和互利的基础上广泛发展经济关系。社会主义阵营的国家准备支持以和平共处和两种世界经济体系和平竞赛的原则为出发点的任何有益的倡议。因此，苏联和欧洲人民民主国家的多年计划的配合和经济合作的其他形式，并不意味着这些国家的经济同资本主义体系隔绝，社会主义阵营的生产力的迅速增长不是阻碍着，而是促进着同资本主义国家的贸易关系的发展。
