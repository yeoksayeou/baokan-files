Xinhua News Agency, May 8th: New York dispatch: The American "New York Times" is attempting to urge Britain to continue maintaining its military bases in Ceylon.

The newspaper published a commentary on May 6, demanding that Commonwealth Prime Ministers, at their upcoming meeting, put pressure on Ceylon's new Prime Minister Bandaranaike "to change his attitude towards the British bases there." It insisted that Ceylon should allow Britain to continue maintaining its military bases on Ceylonese territory.

Bandaranaike recently announced that maintaining British military bases in Ceylon "is in no way in line with our sovereignty as a nation." He said that British troops stationed in Ceylon must leave.

The "New York Times," in defending its desire for Ceylon to continue as a foreign military base, even described Ceylon's demand to remove British military bases, a move to safeguard its national sovereignty, as "economically and strategically unsound."

    美报要求英联邦对锡兰施加压力
　　企图使英国保有在锡兰的基地
    新华社8日讯  纽约消息：美国“纽约时报”企图促使英国继续保持它在锡兰的军事基地。
    这家报纸在五月六日发表评论，要求英联邦总理们在他们即将举行的会议上，对锡兰新总理班达拉奈克施加压力，“使他改变他对那里的英国基地的态度”。它硬说，锡兰应当允许英国继续保持它在锡兰领土上的军事基地。
    班达拉奈克最近已经宣布，在锡兰保持英国的军事基地“是一点也不符合我们作为一个国家的主权的”。他说，英国驻锡兰的军队必须离开。
    “纽约时报”在为它要锡兰继续作为外国军事基地而辩护的时候，甚至把锡兰要撤除英国军事基地这种维护自己国家主权的要求说成是“在经济上和在战略上都是不正当的”。
