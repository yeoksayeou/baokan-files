　　Beibei Chemical Glass Factory and Others Successfully Trial-Produce Glaze Color Materials
    Recently, Beibei Chemical Glass Factory and Luhao Glass Factory in Chongqing jointly trial-produced glass glaze color materials. Beibei Chemical Glass Factory has already used self-made glaze color materials to produce a batch of floral teacups.
    This glaze color material is used in the manufacture of glass floral utensils and was previously imported from abroad at a high cost.
    The successfully trial-produced glaze color materials include five basic colors: red, yellow, blue, green, and white. This glaze color material is not only bright and beautiful in color, but also 20% lower in cost than imported goods. (Sun Yang)

　　北碚化学玻璃厂等试制成釉色料
    重庆北碚化学玻璃厂和鹿蒿玻璃厂最近联合试制成功了玻璃釉色料。北碚化学玻璃厂已经用自制的釉色料生产出一批烧花茶杯。
    这种釉色料在制造玻璃烧花器皿时使用，过去一直由国外进口，成本很高。
    试制成功的釉色料，有红、黄、蓝、绿、白等五个基本颜色。这种釉色料不仅颜色明亮、美观，成本也比进口货低20％。　（孙阳）
