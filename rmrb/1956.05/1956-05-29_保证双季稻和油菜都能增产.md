Guarantee Increased Production of Double-Season Rice and Rapeseed
Lu Pingdong, Deputy Director of the General Bureau of Grain Production, Ministry of Agriculture

This year, as southern provinces expand the planting of double-season rice, a contradiction has arisen in the growing season between expanding double-season rice and developing rapeseed production. This is because the growing period of double-season rice is longer than that of single-season rice, which affects the timely sowing of rapeseed. Conversely, the longer growing period of rapeseed after overwintering affects the timely early transplanting of double-season early rice. Therefore, some rural workers and farmers have great concerns about expanding double-season rice and developing rapeseed production. Some workers in key rapeseed-producing areas also believe that to increase grain production, they must abandon rapeseed production, and to maintain rapeseed production, they cannot switch to double-season rice. If this were the case, the production of rapeseed and grain crops could not develop correspondingly, which would negate the practical significance of expanding multiple cropping areas.

It is undeniable that changing from one crop a year to two crops or from two crops a year to three crops does create some contradictions in the growing seasons of the preceding and following crops. Take double-season continuous rice cultivation as an example. Early rice generally requires about 100 days from sowing and transplanting to harvesting, late rice generally requires 130 to 150 days, and rapeseed generally requires 180 to 210 days. The total growing period of the three crops is at least 410 days and at most 460 days. If the arrangement of the three crops is not appropriate within a year, the growth and development requirements of the next season or the next two seasons of crops may not be met. However, is there a way to overcome this difficulty? Farmers' practices tell us that there is a way. To summarize, there are three ways to overcome this contradiction:

First, select early-maturing, high-yielding varieties; pay attention to the matching of varieties for preceding and following crops. As long as this link is well grasped, and the growth and development laws of the preceding and following crop varieties are followed to achieve timely sowing, rational fertilization, and improved other cultivation techniques, it is possible to overcome the contradiction in the production season between double-season rice and rapeseed and achieve the goal of increased production with three crops. The double-season rice and rapeseed of the First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Hequan Township, Liling County, Hunan Province, both use early-maturing varieties, and the total yield of rapeseed and double-season rice per mu reaches more than 1,100 jin. The high-quality Liangzhong white rapeseed selected by the Huaguang First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Shishan Township, Echeng County, Hubei Province, is sown during Frost's Descent and harvested in April. Generally, each mu can yield more than 150 jin of rapeseed, and up to 300 jin. This variety is very suitable for cultivation in double-season rice areas. The cooperative's double-season rice yield has reached 1,240 jin. If it is cultivated in conjunction with white rapeseed, the total yield of double-season rice and rapeseed per mu can reach more than 1,390 jin. In addition, Qixingjian and Zhushahong in Wenjiang County, Sichuan Province, are both excellent early-maturing, high-yielding rapeseed varieties, and are therefore also excellent preceding crops in double-season rice areas.

Second, promoting rapeseed seedling transplanting and cultivating strong and robust early rice seedlings can meet the growth and development requirements of the preceding and following three crops. Rapeseed seedling transplanting can overcome the contradiction between rapeseed sowing and the late harvesting of the previous crop, and can cultivate strong seedlings in the seedbed, which is conducive to the overwintering growth of rapeseed and promotes the vigorous growth of rapeseed in the later stage, resulting in a significant increase in production. This experience of increased production accumulated by Chinese farmers over the years is a good way to overcome the contradiction between preceding and following crops. In recent years, this method has seen new developments. The Qianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shehong County, Sichuan Province, based on the creation of square grid seedling transplanting of cotton, plans to adopt the same square grid seedling transplanting method in rapeseed production as well (that is, the seedbed is divided into square grids, and a strong seedling is cultivated in each grid. During transplanting, the square grid is transplanted to the field along with the seedling and soil). Professors and experts who visited rapeseed production in Sichuan believed that this method can not only solve the contradiction in the growing season of the three-crop system (including the three crops of double-season rice), but may also have a higher yield-increasing effect than general seedling transplanting. Recently, the Ministry of Agriculture organized representatives from nine provinces (autonomous regions) and twelve special districts in Sichuan to visit key rapeseed-producing areas in Sichuan. After studying the operation methods of square grid seedling cultivation, the representatives dispelled their concerns that it would be difficult to balance the expansion of double-season rice and the development of rapeseed production. Shengli rapeseed is a high-yielding and high-quality variety, but because of its long growing period (requiring earlier sowing and later maturity), under the general cultivation methods, it will affect the early transplanting of double-season early rice. However, the representatives who visited rapeseed production in Jiangxi Province proved that as long as the method of cultivating early rice seedlings for double-season rice is the same as that for cultivating late rice seedlings, that is, the method of cultivating old and strong seedlings is adopted, this difficulty can be completely overcome. In 1955, the Xincun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province, used the method of cultivating old and strong seedlings for double-season early rice (that is, adopting uniform sowing and sparse seedlings, and the seedlings would be extended to 30 to 40 days, until each seedling sent out two or three tillers) for transplanting after the rapeseed harvest. As a result, both rapeseed and rice achieved high yields (an average of 123 jin of rapeseed and 1,150 jin of double-season rice per mu). Even double-season rice, which was transplanted as late as five or six days after Grain Full (Xiaoman), still achieved a yield of 1,060 jin per mu (560 jin of early rice and 500 jin of late rice). Therefore, the cooperative will continue to expand the planting area of Shengli rapeseed, because the harvest period of Shengli rapeseed is around Beginning of Summer (Lixia), and double-season rice can be transplanted around Grain Full (Xiaoman) as long as old and strong seedlings are cultivated.

Third, changing from two crops a year to three crops can also adopt a variety of crop combinations. During the visit to rapeseed production in Sichuan Province this time, some better three-crop system crop combinations were discovered. For example, in some agricultural production cooperatives in Shehong and Wenjiang counties, some used rapeseed, early corn, and late rice as a combination; some used rapeseed, medium-maturity rice, and autumn potatoes or autumn sweet potatoes as a combination. The First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Longqiao Township, Xinfan County, adopted a large combination of a five-crop system in two years (spring potatoes, late rice, rapeseed or other small spring crops, medium-maturity rice, rapeseed), and a crop of Phacelia could also be planted in between. The yield per mu of these crop combinations is all above 1,200 jin, and in terms of income, they all exceed the output value of the same area of rice. The Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences used rice, potatoes, and Shengli rapeseed as a combination, and each mu harvested 650 jin of rice, 1,000 jin of potatoes, and rapeseed is expected to produce more than 300 jin. This shows that in areas where climate, water conservancy, and other conditions are not very sufficient, it is not necessary to use double-season rice and small spring crops as the preceding and following crop combination for the three-crop system.

Rapeseed is one of the important sources of edible oil in China. Its production areas are distributed in more than a dozen provinces in the north and south of the Yangtze River. The existing rapeseed planting area exceeds more than one-third of the total area of oil crops (excluding soybeans). Rapeseed has a very high oil yield; rapeseed cake is a good fertilizer containing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and it is also the best concentrated feed for pigs. Some people regard rapeseed as a low-yield crop and do not pay attention to rapeseed production. In 1955, the Dagai Town Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiangchuan County, Yunnan Province, planted more than 780 mu of rapeseed, with an average yield of more than 270 jin per mu, the highest of which was more than 390 jin. Many such examples show that rapeseed is not necessarily a low-yield crop that can only produce a few dozen or dozens of jin per mu; as long as high-quality varieties are well selected and tillage and cultivation techniques are improved, rapeseed production can be greatly increased.

In order to correctly expand the multiple cropping area and achieve all-round production increases, local agricultural departments should help agricultural production cooperatives carry out overall planning, and on the premise of planting according to local conditions, ensure that grain, cotton, oil crops, and other cash crops can increase production, both meeting the needs of the country and ensuring that farmers' incomes increase rather than decrease. Only in this way will the measures to expand the multiple cropping area have positive significance.

    保证双季稻和油菜都能增产
    农业部粮食生产总局副局长　陆平东
    今年南方各省在扩大种植双季稻的时候，在生长季节上发生了扩大双季稻和发展油菜生产的矛盾。这是因为双季稻的生长期比单季稻要长，影响油菜的适期播种；而油菜越冬以后的生长期较长，又影响双季早稻在适期内提早插秧。因此，有些农村工作人员和农民群众，对于扩种双季稻和发展油菜生产有很大的顾虑。有些油菜重点产区的工作人员也认为要增产粮食，就得放弃油菜生产，要维持油菜生产，就不能改种双季稻。如果真是这样的话，油菜和粮食作物的生产就无法相应地发展，这样也就失却扩大复种面积的实际意义了。
    不可否认，改一年一熟为两熟或一年两熟为三熟，在前后两作或三作的生长季节上，是有某些矛盾的。拿双季连作稻来说，早稻从播种、插秧到收获一般需要一百天左右，晚稻一般需要一百三十天至一百五十天，油菜一般需要一百八十天至二百一十天，前后三作生长期的总和，少则四百十天，多则四百六十天。以一年为一周期，如果前后三作安排不够适当，就可能使下一季或下两季作物的生长发育的要求得不到满足。但是，这种困难有没有办法克服呢？农民的实践告诉我们，它是有办法克服的。克服这个矛盾的办法，归纳起来，有以下三种。
    第一，选用早熟、丰产的品种；注意前后作品种的配合。只要很好地掌握这个环节，再根据前后作品种的生长发育规律，做到适期播种、合理施肥，并且改进其他栽培技术，就能够克服双季稻和油菜的生产季节的矛盾，达到三熟增产的目的。湖南醴陵县河泉乡第一农业生产合作社的双季稻和油菜，都是采用早熟品种，油菜和双季稻每亩的总产量达到一千一百多斤。湖北鄂城县石山乡华光第一农业生产合作社选用的良种白油菜，在霜降播种，四月收获，一般每亩可收菜籽一百五十多斤，高的可达三百斤，这个品种极宜于双季稻区栽培。这个社的双季稻产量曾达一千二百四十斤，如果和白油菜连作，双季稻和油菜的总产量每亩可达一千三百九十斤以上。此外，四川温江县的七星剑、朱砂红等都是早熟、丰产的优良油菜品种，因而也是双季稻区的优良前作。
    第二，推行油菜育苗移栽和早稻培育老壮秧，可以满足前后三作生长发育的要求。油菜育苗移栽，能够克服油菜播种和前季作物收获迟之间的矛盾，且能在苗床内培育健壮幼苗，有利于油菜越冬生长，促使油菜后期生长健壮，增产效果显著。我国农民多年来积累的这个增产经验是克服前后作矛盾的好办法。最近几年来，这个方法又有了新的发展。四川省射洪县前锋农业生产合作社在创造棉花方格育苗移栽的基础上，计划在油菜生产中也采取同样的方格育苗移栽办法（就是把苗畦划成方格，在每个方格内培育一个壮苗，移栽的时候，把这个方格连苗带土移栽到大田里）。到四川参观油菜生产的教授、专家们认为，这种办法不但可以解决三熟制（包括双季稻的三熟）在生长季节上的矛盾，而且可能有高于一般的育苗移栽的增产效果。最近农业部组织九个省（区）及四川十二个专区的代表，参观了四川油菜重点产区，在研究了方格育苗的操作方法以后，打消了代表们认为扩种双季稻和发展油菜生产难以兼顾的顾虑。胜利油菜是产量高的优良品种，但是因为它生长期较长（播种需较早、成熟较迟），在采用一般的栽培方法的情况下，会影响双季早稻的提早插秧。可是，江西参观油菜生产的代表证明，只要将双季早稻育秧的方法和培育晚稻秧苗一样采用培育老壮秧的办法，这个困难完全可以克服。江西省萍乡县新村农业生产合作社，1955年种双季早稻用培育老壮秧的办法（即采取匀播稀秧，秧会延长到三、四十天，到每根秧苗发出两三个分蘖为准）在油菜收获后插秧，结果，油菜和水稻都得到了很高的产量（平均每亩收菜籽123斤，双季稻一千一百五十斤）。就是早稻迟到小满后五、六天才插秧的双季稻每亩产量仍然达到一千零六十斤（早稻五百六十斤、晚稻五百斤）。因此这个社还要继续扩大胜利油菜的种植面积。因为胜利油菜的收获期在立夏边，而双季稻只要培育老壮秧，可延至小满前后栽插。
    第三，一年两熟改三熟，还可以采取多种多样的农作物组合。这次在四川省参观油菜生产的过程中，曾经发现一些较好的三熟制的农作物组合。例如在射洪、温江两县一些农业生产合作社中，有的用油菜、早玉米和晚稻为一组合；有的用油菜、中熟稻和秋马铃薯或秋红薯为一个组合。新繁县龙桥乡第一农业生产合作社，采用两年五熟制的大组合（春马铃薯、晚稻、油菜或其他小春作物、中熟稻、油菜），中间还可抢种一季水苕子。这些农作物组合的每亩产量，都在一千二百斤以上，就收益来说，都超过同等面积的稻谷产值。四川农业科学研究所以水稻、马铃薯、胜利油菜为一个组合，每亩收获水稻六百五十斤、马铃薯一千斤，油菜预计可产三百斤以上。由此可见，在气候、水利等条件不很充分的地区，不一定都要以双季稻和小春作物为三熟制的前后作组合。
    油菜是我国食用油脂的重要油源之一，它的产区分布在长江南北十几个省，现有的油菜种植面积，超过油料作物总面积（大豆除外）的三分之一以上。油菜出油率很高；菜子饼是一种含有氮、磷、钾三要素的好肥料，也是猪的最好的精饲料。有些人把油菜看作是低产作物，不重视油菜生产。云南省江川县大街镇农业生产合作社1955年种植的七百八十多亩油菜，每亩平均产量在二百七十斤以上，其中最高的达三百九十多斤。有许多这类例子说明油菜并不是只能亩产十几斤或几十斤的低产作物；只要很好地选用良种，改进耕作栽培技术，油菜产量是可以大大提高的。
    为了正确地扩大复种面积，做到全面增产，各地农业部门应当帮助农业生产合作社进行全面规划，在因地种植的前提下，保证粮食、棉花、油料及其他经济作物都能增产，既满足国家的需要，又使得农民的收入有增无减。只有这样，扩大复种面积的措施，才有积极的意义。
