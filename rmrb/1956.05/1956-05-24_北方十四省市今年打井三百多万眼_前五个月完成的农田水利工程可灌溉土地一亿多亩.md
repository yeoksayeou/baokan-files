Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 23rd. The Ministry of Water Resources convened the Northern Farmland Water Conservancy Work Conference in Zhengzhou from the 14th to the 22nd. The conference proposed: all projects completed this year must guarantee irrigation.

The conference compiled statistics on the progress of projects in the northern fourteen provinces (regions) and cities up to the end of April: 3.78 million new wells were dug, 350,000 waterwheels were loaned, pumping machines with over 56,000 horsepower were developed, 16,000 medium and small reservoirs were built, and over 500,000 irrigation projects were newly built and renovated. These projects can irrigate 86.87 million mu of land. It is estimated that by the end of May, the number of completed projects will be able to irrigate over 100 million mu of land, accounting for 89% of this year's plan. The conference believes that due to the promotion of the agricultural cooperativization movement, the number of completed projects is historically unprecedented, and the irrigation benefits of these projects must be guaranteed in the future. The conference requires that all localities pay attention to solving the problem of water lifting tools so that the completed wells can be irrigated in a timely manner. The methods of Liaoning, Hebei, Henan, Gansu, Shandong and other provinces in convening meetings of farmers, ironsmiths, carpenters, etc. to solve the problem of wooden water lifting tools can be promoted. In order to effectively exert the benefits of these projects, the conference believes that it is necessary to level the land and repair field canals in a timely manner; and strengthen irrigation management and leadership of the irrigation system; for those projects with poor quality and incomplete projects, they should be quickly renovated and resolutely completed to ensure that they can play their benefits this year.

For water conservancy projects in the second half of 1956, the conference particularly emphasized doing a comprehensive job of "more, faster, better, more economical, and safer," to ensure the quality of the projects.

The conference also arranged soil and water conservation work. The conference believes that the progress of soil and water conservation work this year is too slow. The provinces in the Yellow River Basin should conscientiously implement the requirements of "unified planning and comprehensive development" put forward by the National Soil and Water Conservation Work Conference, strengthen leadership, and complete this year's task of soil and water conservation work.

    北方十四省市今年打井三百多万眼
    前五个月完成的农田水利工程可灌溉土地一亿多亩
    新华社郑州23日电　十四日到二十二日，水利部在郑州召开了北方农田水利工作会议。会议提出：今年完成的工程都要保证实行灌溉。
    会议统计了北方十四省（区）、市到四月底工程完成的情况是，打成新井378万眼，贷出水车三十五万部，发展抽水机五万六千多马力，兴建中、小水库一万六千座，新修和整修灌溉工程五十多万处。这些工程可以灌溉8，687万亩土地。预计到五月底，完成的工程数量共可以灌溉一亿多亩土地，占今年计划的89％。会议认为，由于农业合作化运动的推动，已经完成的工程数量是历史上空前的，今后必须保证这些工程的灌溉效益。会议要求各地必须注意提水工具的解决，使已完成的水井都能及时进行灌溉。辽宁、河北、河南、甘肃、山东等省召开农民、铁工、木工等会议解决木制提水工具的办法可以推广。为了切实发挥这些工程效益，会议认为必须及时平整土地和修田间小渠；并且加强灌溉管理工作及对灌溉制度的领导；对于那些质量不好和未完成的工程，应迅速进行整修和坚决完成，务使其在今年内能够发挥效益。
    对1956年下半年的水利工程，会议特别强调了全面地做到“又多、又快、又好、又省、又安全”，保证工程的质量。
    这次会议同时布置了水土保持工作。会议认为今年的水土保持工作进度太慢。黄河流域各省要认真贯彻全国水土保持工作会议提出的“统一规划，综合开发”的要求，加强领导，完成本年度水土保持工作的任务。
