    Montgomery Black People's Boycott

    Montgomery, Alabama, once the capital of the Southern slave owners during the American Civil War, has a population of 120,000, 40% of whom are Black. For the past five months, the 50,000 Black residents' persistent boycott of white buses has become one of the most important events in the current American Black anti-racial discrimination movement.

    The beginning of this struggle can be traced back to the evening of December 1st last year when Mrs. Parks, a Black woman, was riding a "Montgomery City Bus Company" bus. When she sat in the so-called white-only seat, the police authorities arrested and detained her, and forced her to wear handcuffs and fingerprints like a criminal. On December 5, the city court also fined her $14 or 14 days in jail for violating the racial segregation system on the bus. Not long before this, two other similar incidents of discrimination against Black women had occurred.

    On the evening of December 5, thousands of angry Black people held a mass protest meeting, at which a resolution to boycott the bus company was unanimously passed, and the "Montgomery Improvement Association" was established to lead the struggle. In order to effectively carry out the boycott, the Black people organized a motorcade of hundreds of cars to pick up and drop off Black people who needed transportation. At the same time, the Black people asked the bus company to implement a first-come, first-served policy, treat Black passengers politely, and hire Black drivers.

    Black people account for two-thirds of the "Montgomery City Bus Company's" daily passengers. With 95% of Black people participating in the boycott, the company was forced to raise fares, reduce services, and lay off employees. However, the state authorities ordered the continuation of racial segregation on buses, and local racists began to use assassination and arrest to deal with Black people who persisted in the boycott. They successively threw bombs at the homes of the leaders of the boycott movement. Then, the Montgomery city authorities, citing the "prohibition of boycotts" law, arrested more than 100 Black leaders on February 23. The racists' tactics of terror and persecution did not make the Black people retreat. On the 24th, Black people in Montgomery walked for a day to show the unity of all Black people and their determination to persist in the struggle.

    The just struggle of Black people in Montgomery has won the sympathy of world public opinion. UN Under-Secretary-General Bunche, stationed in New York, said in a congratulatory telegram that the boycott movement was "an inspiring chapter in the history of human dignity... You will stand firm in the face of threats and police state intimidation." Progressive organizations, trade unions, and religious groups of white and Black people across the United States also protested and donated money to support the struggle of Black people in Montgomery.

    However, the Montgomery City Court blatantly ignored the condemnation of public opinion and began trying 93 Black leaders on March 19. Although the defendants pointed out that the purpose of the bus boycott was to improve the status of the race and oppose the persecution of Black people, and although many Black witnesses testified in court to the abuse of Black people on buses, the court still declared the leaders of the boycott movement guilty, fining them $500 or 140 days of hard labor. According to the Associated Press, the American people have repeatedly demanded that President Eisenhower and Attorney General Brownell take action against the illegal mass arrests and trials by the Montgomery city authorities, but Eisenhower believed that the trial was "legal" at a press conference on March 21.

    To protest the persecution of Black people in Montgomery, Black people across the United States held a national "Support and Prayer Day" on March 28. According to American newspapers, 28,000 people participated in the prayer meeting in Chicago alone.

    The struggle in Montgomery has brought new strength to the American Black movement. It not only demonstrates the Black people's firm will to fight for equal rights, but also shows the strengthening of the unity of Black people across the country. According to a March issue of "U.S. News & World Report," influential figures in many Southern states fear that Black people will widely adopt the boycott movement in the economy, which is a great threat to the white industry and commerce in the South, where Black people account for a large part of the population. Therefore, they have also begun to express that the unreasonable system of racial segregation should be abolished.

    Under the pressure of domestic and foreign public opinion, the U.S. Supreme Court announced on April 23 that it would abolish racial segregation on buses. However, many state authorities in the South still refused to implement the decision, and the Montgomery city authorities also announced that they would continue to arrest Black people who violated the racial segregation system. In order to defeat the racists, Black people in Montgomery expressed their determination to carry out the boycott to the end at a meeting of thousands of people. Recently, representatives of dozens of Black organizations met in Washington to form a "Leadership Committee" to lead and coordinate the growing anti-discrimination movement and the struggle for equal civil rights.

    At present, the movement of American Black people against racial discrimination is led by the Black bourgeoisie, pastors, and intellectuals, and has its own weaknesses; but as the American Communist Party publication "Political Affairs Monthly" pointed out: it is an important part of the struggle to complete the bourgeois democratic revolution in the American South, which enslaved Black people, and it is also an important part of the American people's struggle for democratic freedom and the improvement of their lives. American Communist Party General Secretary Dennis recently emphasized at an enlarged meeting of the American Communist Party National Committee that the Black liberation movement, which has regained its strength, has reached an unprecedented scale. He called on the American progressive forces to give greater support. (Lin Longtie) (Attached picture)
    
    Sir, are you afraid?
    Ah... no, I am maintaining the racial segregation system.

### 蒙哥马利市黑人的抵制运动

    蒙哥马利市黑人的抵制运动
    在美国南北战争时，一度作为南方奴隶主首都的阿拉巴马州蒙哥马利市，它的十二万居民中，40％是黑人。最近五个多月来，五万黑人居民坚持抵制白人公共汽车的斗争，已成为目前美国黑人反对种族歧视运动中最重要事件之一。
    这个斗争的开端，应回溯到去年十二月一日的傍晚，黑人派克斯夫人在乘“蒙哥马利市汽车公司”的公共汽车时，坐在所谓白人专座上，警察当局就将她逮捕和拘禁，并且像罪犯似的强迫她带上手铐和打指印。十二月五日，市法院还以在公共汽车上违反种族隔离制度的罪名，罚她十四美元或十四天监禁。在这之前不久，还发生过另外两个黑人妇女遭到歧视的类似事件。
    十二月五日晚上，数千名愤怒的黑人举行了群众抗议大会，会上一致通过抵制这家汽车公司的决议，并且成立“蒙哥马利市改进协会”，来领导这个斗争。为了使抵制运动有效开展，黑人组织一支拥有数百辆小汽车的汽车队，专门接送需要乘车的黑人。同时，黑人向汽车公司提出先来先坐，对黑人乘客有礼貌和雇佣黑人司机的要求。
    “蒙哥马利市汽车公司”的日常乘客三分之二是黑人，由于95％黑人参加了抵制运动，这家公司被迫提高票价，减少班次和裁减人员。但是，州当局命令在公共汽车上继续保持种族隔离制度，而当地种族主义者开始采用暗杀和逮捕手段来对付坚持抵制运动的黑人，他们先后向抵制运动领导人家里投掷炸弹，接着，蒙哥马利市当局又援引“禁止进行抵制”法律，在二月二十三日逮捕了一百余名黑人领袖。种族主义者的恐怖和迫害手段并没有使黑人退缩，二十四日，蒙哥马利市黑人步行一天，来表示全体黑人的团结和坚持斗争的决心。
    蒙哥马利市黑人的正义斗争博得世界舆论的同情。驻在纽约的联合国副秘书长本奇在一封慰问的电报中说，这个抵制运动是“人类尊严史上令人鼓舞的一章……你们将在进行威胁和采取警察国家的恫吓方法面前屹立不动”。美国全国各地的白人和黑人的进步组织、工会以及宗教团体也纷纷提出抗议，并且捐款声援蒙哥马利市黑人的斗争。
    但是，蒙哥马利市法院悍然不顾舆论的谴责，从三月十九日起，开始审讯九十三名黑人领袖。尽管被告们指出抵制公共汽车的目的是为了争取改善种族地位，反对迫害黑人，虽然有许多黑人证人在法庭上控诉在公共汽车上虐待黑人的行为，法院仍然宣判抵制运动的领导人有罪，罚处五百元美金或一四○天苦役。据美联社报道，对蒙哥马利市当局的非法的大规模逮捕和审讯，美国人民曾纷纷要求艾森豪威尔总统和司法部长布朗纳尔采取行动，但是艾森豪威尔在三月二十一日记者招待会上却认为审判是“合法的”。
    为了抗议对蒙哥马利市黑人的迫害，三月二十八日，美国各地黑人举行了全国规模的“支援和祈祷日”。据美国报刊报道，仅芝加哥一地，就有二万八千人参加了祈祷会。
    蒙哥马利市的斗争给美国黑人运动带来了新的力量，它不仅表现了黑人争取平等权利的坚强意志，同时也显示了全国黑人的团结的加强。据三月份一期“美国新闻与世界报道”说，南部许多州的有影响人士害怕黑人将在经济上广泛采用抵制运动，这对黑人占人口很大部分的南方的白人工商业是一个很大的威胁，因此他们也开始表示应该取消种族隔离的不合理制度。
    在国内外舆论的压力下，美国最高法院在四月二十三日宣布取消公共汽车的种族隔离制度。然而，南部许多州当局仍然拒绝执行这项决议，蒙哥马利市当局并且还宣布要继续逮捕违反种族隔离制度的黑人。为了打败种族主义者，蒙哥马利市的黑人在一次数千人的大会上，表示决心要将抵制运动进行到底。最近，数十个黑人组织的代表在华盛顿开会，成立了一个“领导委员会”，来领导和协调日益高涨的反歧视运动和争取平等公民权利的斗争。
    目前，美国黑人反对种族歧视的运动是由黑人资产阶级、牧师和知识分子领导，存在着本身的弱点；但是正如美国共产党刊物“政事月刊”指出的：它是在奴役黑人的美国南部完成资产阶级民主革命斗争的一个重要部分，同时也是美国人民争取民主自由和改善生活斗争的一个重要组成部分。美国共产党总书记丹尼斯最近在美共全国委员会扩大会议上强调说，重新恢复了力量的黑人解放运动，已经达到空前壮大的程度。他号召美国进步力量给予更大的支持。（林龙铁）（附图片）
    阁下，你害怕吗？
    啊……，不，我是保持种族隔离制度。
