Hainan Island's eastern coastal counties of Qiongdong, Lehui, and Wanning have begun the summer harvest. In Wanning County, seventy-nine townships started harvesting early rice in mid-April, with sixty-nine townships initially reporting a bumper harvest. The Fengmei Township No. 1 Agricultural Production Cooperative, which won the Guangdong Province First-Class Collective Labor Model Award last year for achieving "thousand-catty communes," has harvested fifteen mu of land, averaging 680 catties of grain per mu, an increase of 85 catties compared to last year's early rice. The twenty-odd townships in Lehui and Qiongdong counties near the Wanquan River also generally report a bumper early rice harvest this year. The Xinhua Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lijun Township, Lehui County, persisted in fighting drought and carrying out technological reforms during spring plowing and production, and also harvested 400 catties of net grain per mu, almost equal to the annual output in normal years.

    海南岛早稻丰收
    海南岛东海岸的琼东、乐会、万宁县已经开始夏收。万宁县七十九个乡在四月中旬开始动镰收割早稻，有六十九个乡初报丰收。去年因为实现千斤社，获得广东省一等集体劳动模范奖的丰美乡第一农业生产合作社，已收割的十五亩田，平均每亩收谷六百八十斤，比去年早稻多收八十五斤。乐会、琼东两县靠近万全河两岸的二十多个乡，今年早稻也普告丰收。乐会县立君乡新华农业生产合作社，在春耕生产中坚持抗旱和进行技术改革，每亩也收到四百斤净谷，差不多等于常年一年的产量。
