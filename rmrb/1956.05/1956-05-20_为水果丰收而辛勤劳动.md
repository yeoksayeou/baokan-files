    To the Editor:
    The members of the Jinxing Fruit Farmers' Production Cooperative in Yuantou Township, Laoshan Suburban District, Qingdao City, unanimously proposed to guarantee the production of more than 1.9 million jin of fruit this year to meet the needs of the city's people. According to the cooperative's fruit production plan for this year, the average yield per fruit tree will be doubled compared to the mutual aid team period and 15% higher than during the primary cooperative period.
    After the cooperative transitioned to a higher-level cooperative, the members have shown great enthusiasm for production. As early as last winter, the cooperative organized experienced fruit farmers to prune the fruit trees in a unified manner. During pruning, fruiting branches and reserve fruiting branches were retained, so that these fruit trees will not only bear fruit this year but also continue to bear fruit next year, overcoming the phenomenon of fruit trees bearing fruit one year and resting the next. They also plan to properly thin the fruit after fruit set, based on the size and growth of the trees, so that the fruit will grow larger and better in the future.
    To ensure a bountiful harvest of fruit trees, preventing and controlling pests and diseases is a very important task. Last winter, the cooperative already carried out the work of scraping the bark of fruit trees with rot disease and digging out insect eggs under the roots of the trees, and sprayed all fruit trees with lime-sulfur mixture to completely eliminate overwintering pests. This year, apricot trees have already been sprayed with "666" powder once before flowering; pear trees have also been sprayed with "666" powder once. They are very confident in eliminating pests because in the past, the cooperative and individual farmers' orchards were adjacent to each other, and only the cooperative sprayed insecticides, and the pests from nearby orchards would still fly over. This year, the entire township has been cooperativized, and the cooperative can spray pesticides at a unified time, and the pest control effect is very different from the past.
    The cooperative also launched a well-drilling campaign last winter, drilling a total of 104 water wells, building one reservoir, and another reservoir is under construction. These water conservancy projects can ensure that fruit trees can be irrigated during droughts. In order to ensure that the fruit trees have sufficient fertilizer, the members began to fertilize the fruit trees last winter.

### 为水果丰收而辛勤劳动

    为水果丰收而辛勤劳动编辑同志：
    青岛市崂山郊区源头乡金星果农生产合作社的社员们一致提出保证今年要生产一百九十多万斤水果，来满足城市人民的需要。按照这个社今年的水果生产计划，平均每株果树的产量要比互助组的时候提高一倍，比初级社的时候提高15％。
    合作社转为高级社以后，社员们生产劲头很足。早在去年冬天，社里就组织了有经验的果农统一修剪果树。在修剪的时候，还留出了结果枝和预备结果枝，因而使这些果树不仅今年能结果，来年还可以继续结果，克服了过去果树结一年、歇一年的现象。他们还准备在结果以后，根据树的大小和长的好坏，适当进行疏果，以便使今后的水果长的又大又好。
    要保证果树的丰收，防除病虫害是一项很重要的工作。这个社在去年冬天已经进行了为有腐烂病的果树刮皮和在树根下挖掘虫卵的工作，并且对所有果树喷布了石灰硫磺合剂，以便彻底消灭越冬害虫。今年杏树在开花以前已经喷布了一遍“六六六”药粉；梨树也已喷布了一遍“六六六”药粉。他们对除灭虫害很有信心，因为过去合作社和单干农户果园相邻，光合作社喷布杀虫药，附近果园的害虫仍然会飞来；今年全乡合作化了，合作社可以统一时间喷布药剂，除虫效果就和过去大不一样了。
    这个社在去年冬季还开展了打井运动，共打了水井104眼，修了水库一处，还有一处水库正在施工。这些水利工程就可以保证天旱时果树能够得到灌溉。为了保证果树有充足的肥料，社员从去年冬季就开始对果树施肥。
