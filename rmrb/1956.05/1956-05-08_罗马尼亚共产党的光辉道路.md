　　Today is the 35th anniversary of the founding of the Romanian Communist Party. The Chinese people, with the highest respect and great joy, extend fraternal congratulations to the advanced force of the Romanian working class, which leads the Romanian people in building socialism and striving for lasting peace and friendship between all peoples.
    The Romanian Communist Party was founded on May 8, 1921. Under the influence of the great October Socialist Revolution, the Romanian workers' movement made great progress, and on this basis, the Romanian Marxist-Leninist party was born. At the founding congress of the Romanian Communist Party, the party, representing the working class, announced its opposition to the Romanian bourgeoisie and the landlord government's provocative policy of launching an aggressive anti-Soviet war and its reactionary domestic policy. From then on, the Romanian Communist Party waged arduous and heroic struggles under brutal terror, and persisted in extremely secret underground activities for twenty years. After 1929, the Romanian reactionaries embarked on the road of intensifying national fascism. The Romanian Communist Party waged arduous struggles against fascism and the danger of war, while purifying the party internally, strengthening its unity, and maintaining its unification. The Fifth Congress of the Party, held in 1932, formulated the party's strategic and tactical line: to carry out the bourgeois democratic revolution to the end and transition to the socialist revolution in countries where capitalism is underdeveloped and there are feudal remnants. After Hitler Germany launched a bloody attack on the Soviet Union, the Romanian military fascist government plunged Romania into a criminal anti-Soviet war and made Romania a vassal of Hitler Germany. At a time when the motherland was in serious crisis, the Romanian Communist Party waged a heroic struggle against the fascist occupiers and traitors of the motherland. In 1944, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Romanian people, taking advantage of the favorable situation of the Soviet army defeating the Hitler army and Antonescu's Romanian army, launched the famous August 23rd armed uprising, overthrew the fascist reactionary regime, withdrew Romania from the fascist war, and won national liberation.
    After transitioning from underground struggle to open activities, the Romanian Communist Party, in the early post-World War II period, led the people in eliminating feudal remnants in the countryside, implementing land reform, eliminating the phenomenon of oppressed minorities, abolishing the monarchy, and establishing a people's democratic regime based on the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class. On December 30, 1947, the king was deposed, and the Romanian People's Republic was established. After 1948, the Republic implemented the nationalization of industrial means of production and turned to fighting to lay the foundation for a socialist economy.
    The Romanian Communist Party has consistently strived for the unity of the Romanian working class and the unification of the workers' movement. In February 1948, the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party merged on the ideological and organizational basis of Marxism-Leninism, establishing the unified party of the working class—the Romanian Workers' Party. The ideological, political, and organizational unity of the working class greatly enhanced its leading role in national and social life.
    The Romanian Workers' Party is leading the people of the whole country in the huge work of restoration and construction to lay the foundation of the socialist economy, and has already achieved brilliant achievements. Thanks to the completion of the first Five-Year Plan formulated under the leadership of the Workers' Party and the implementation of the Ten-Year Electrification Plan, in a very short period of time, the Romanian people have eliminated the economic backwardness left over by history and transformed their country into an industrial-agricultural country with advanced industries. At present, the socialist component in industry has almost reached 100%. In 1955, the total industrial output was 3.4 times that of 1948, and many new industrial sectors that had never existed in history have been established. The major industries, the oil industry, and the machinery manufacturing industry have achieved unusually rapid development. As a result of the implementation of the Ten-Year Electrification Plan, twenty new power stations have been built in five years, and the total power generation capacity has doubled within five years. Agriculture is developing along the road of socialist transformation. Last year, the socialist component accounted for 26.5% of the cultivated land area. The grain production target set in the Five-Year Plan has been overfulfilled one year ahead of schedule. In 1955, the socialist component accounted for more than 80% of retail commerce. On the basis of the continuous development of socialist production, the people's material and cultural living standards have been significantly improved.
    The Second Congress of the Workers' Party, held at the end of last year, formulated the second Five-Year Plan for the further development of the national economy. The implementation of this plan will increase the total amount of basic construction projects by 67-75% compared with the first Five-Year Plan, and will further develop agriculture on the existing basis of agricultural collectivization. The realization of this plan will lead the Romanian people to the comprehensive victory of socialist construction, to the further improvement of material and cultural welfare, and to strengthen the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the forces of all the people in the world to defend peace and democracy!
    The Chinese people, from the distant western shore of the Pacific Ocean, are concerned with the achievements of the Romanian brothers by the Black Sea and are inspired by their victories. Between the Chinese and Romanian people, through the implementation of relevant agreements on cultural, scientific, technological and economic cooperation, and the increasingly close contact between the two fraternal parties and peoples, an unbreakable friendship has been established and is developing day by day. During the Second Congress of the Workers' Party, the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government and the people sent a delegation headed by Comrade Zhu De to congratulate, which brought new development to the friendship between the two peoples. In celebrating the glorious 35th anniversary of the Romanian Communist Party, we must strive to build our great motherland, and together with the Romanian people, cooperate more closely to develop our common cause, and work hand in hand to consolidate and strengthen the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, to defend world peace and develop the cause of human progress!

　　罗马尼亚共产党的光辉道路
    今天是罗马尼亚共产党成立三十五周年纪念日。中国人民怀着崇高的敬意和极大的欢乐，向领导着罗马尼亚人民建设社会主义、争取持久和平和各国人民之间友谊的罗马尼亚工人阶级的先进部队，致以兄弟般的祝贺。
    罗马尼亚共产党成立于1921年5月8日。在伟大的十月社会主义革命的影响下，罗马尼亚工人运动有了很大的进展，在这一基础上，罗马尼亚的马克思列宁主义政党诞生了。在罗马尼亚共产党成立大会上，党代表工人阶级宣布了反对罗马尼亚资产阶级和地主政府当时所执行的发动侵略性的反苏战争的挑衅政策和反动的国内政策。从那时起，罗马尼亚共产党就在残酷的恐怖环境下进行着艰苦而英勇的斗争，并坚持进行了二十年极端秘密的地下活动。1929年以后，罗马尼亚反动派走上了加紧国家法西斯化的道路，罗马尼亚共产党为反对法西斯化和战争危险作了艰苦的斗争，同时纯洁了党的内部，加强了党的团结，维护了党的统一。1932年举行的党的第五次代表大会，制定了党的战略策略：在资本主义不发展而有着封建残余的国家内，把资产阶级民主革命进行到底，并使它过渡到社会主义革命的路线。希特勒德国对苏联发动了血腥进攻后，罗马尼亚的军事法西斯政府把罗马尼亚投入了罪恶的反苏战争，并使罗马尼亚成了希特勒德国的附庸。在祖国陷于严重危急的关头，罗马尼亚共产党为反对法西斯占领者和祖国叛徒进行了英勇的斗争。1944年，罗马尼亚人民在共产党领导下，借着苏联军队击溃希特勒军队和安东尼斯库的罗马尼亚军队的有利形势，举行了有名的八月二十三日武装起义，推翻了法西斯反动政权，使罗马尼亚退出了法西斯战争，获得了民族解放。
    从地下斗争转为公开活动以后的罗马尼亚共产党，在二次大战后的初期，领导人民肃清了农村的封建残余，实行了土地改革，消除了少数民族被压迫的现象，废除了君主制度，建立了在工人阶级领导下的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主政权。1947年12月30日，废黜了国王，成立了罗马尼亚人民共和国。1948年以后，共和国实行了工业生产资料国有化的措施，转到为奠定社会主义经济基础而斗争。
    罗马尼亚共产党一贯为罗马尼亚工人阶级的团结和工人运动的统一而努力。1948年2月，共产党和社会民主党在马克思列宁主义的思想基础和组织基础上进行了合并，建立了工人阶级统一的政党——罗马尼亚工人党。工人阶级在思想上、政治上、组织上的团结一致，大大提高了对国家和社会生活的领导作用。
    罗马尼亚工人党领导全国人民进行着奠定社会主义经济基础的巨大恢复建设工作，已经获得了光辉的成就。由于完成了工人党领导制定的第一个五年计划和执行了十年电气化计划，在很短的时期内，罗马尼亚人民已经扫除了历史遗留下来的经济落后状态，使自己的国家变成拥有先进工业的工业—农业国家了。现在，社会主义成分在工业中差不多已占100％，1955年工业总产量已相当于1948年的三点四倍，许多在历史上没有过的新的工业部门建立起来了。主要的工业，石油工业和机器制造业获得了异常迅速的发展。十年电气化计划执行的结果，五年中新建了二十个电力站，总发电能力在五年之内增加为两倍。农业正沿着社会主义改造的道路发展着。去年，社会主义成分已占耕地面积的26.5％，五年计划预定的谷物生产指标，已提前一年超额完成。1955年社会主义成分在零售商业中已占80％以上。在社会主义生产不断发展的基础上，人民的物质文化生活水平有了显著的提高。
    去年年底召开的工人党的第二次代表大会拟定了进一步发展国民经济的第二个五年计划，这个计划的实施将使基本建设的工程总量，比第一个五年计划增加67—75％，并将在农业合作化已有的基础上进一步发展农业。这个计划的实现将引导罗马尼亚人民走上社会主义建设事业的全面胜利，走上物质文化福利的进一步增进，并加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界人民保卫和平民主的力量！
    中国人民从遥远的太平洋西岸关切地注视着黑海边的罗马尼亚兄弟的奋斗成果，并从他们的胜利中得到鼓舞。中罗两国人民之间，通过有关文化、科学技术和经济合作协定的执行，以及两国兄弟党和人民之间的日益亲密的接触，建立了并日益发展着牢不可破的友谊。在工人党第二次代表大会期间，中国共产党、中国政府和人民，派出了以朱德同志为首的代表团前往祝贺，使两国人民之间的友谊有了新的发展。在庆贺罗马尼亚共产党光辉的三十五周年的时候，我们一定要努力建设我们伟大的祖国，并和罗马尼亚人民一道，为发展我们共同事业而更亲密地合作，为巩固和加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，为保卫世界和平和发展人类的进步事业而携手并进！
