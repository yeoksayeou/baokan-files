Xinhua News Agency, May 27th, Paris Dispatch: According to "l'Humanité", the Tunisian Communist Party recently held its Fifth Congress. In his report to the Congress, the General Secretary of the Tunisian Communist Party, Ennafaa, pointed out the tasks that the Tunisian people must solve in order to finally win and consolidate national independence. He pointed out that the working class must establish a solid united front with the poorest strata, the unemployed, and the working peasants among the people. This is the most effective and reliable way to ensure the implementation of social progress and democratic policies.

Ennafaa said that between the Fourth and Fifth Congresses, the Tunisian people have achieved great successes in the struggle for national independence. These achievements are primarily the result of the heroic struggle of the Tunisian people. However, the tremendous changes that have taken place in the international situation in recent years have also played a significant role.

The Congress passed a resolution on the general policy of the Tunisian Communist Party and approved a new party program.

The Congress elected a new Central Committee. Ennafaa, Mu. Amer, and A. Mazhri were all elected to the Secretariat of the Tunisian Communist Party.

    突尼斯共产党总书记在党的代表大会上指出
    突尼斯人民当前任务为巩固民族独立
    新华社27日讯　巴黎消息：据“人道报”报道，突尼斯共产党不久前举行了第五次代表大会。突尼斯共产党总书记恩纳法在向大会所作的报告中指出了突尼斯人民为了最后争取和巩固民族独立所必需解决的任务。他指出，工人阶级必须同人民群众中的赤贫阶层、失业者和农民劳动群众建立起巩固的统一战线，这是保证实行社会进步和民主政策的一个最有效和最可靠的途径。
    恩纳法说，在第四次代表大会到第五次代表大会期间，突尼斯人民在争取祖国独立的斗争中获得了极大的成就。这些成就首先是突尼斯人民英勇斗争的结果。但是，最近几年来在国际局势中所发生的巨大变化，也有很大的关系。
    代表大会通过了关于突尼斯共产党总政策的决议，并且批准了新的党纲。
    大会选出了新的中央委员会。恩纳法、穆·阿麦尔和阿·马热里都被选入突尼斯共产党书记处。
