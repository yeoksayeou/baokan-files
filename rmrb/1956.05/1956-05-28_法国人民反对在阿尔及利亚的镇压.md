    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 27th: Increasingly, French soldiers and people are holding demonstrations to protest the government's military suppression in Algeria.
    On May 24th alone, several demonstrations by soldiers took place. When a military train stopped in Amiens, about two hundred soldiers left the station and marched on the main streets. It took considerable effort by the police to drive these soldiers back to the station. In Laon, soldiers lay on the tracks in front of the train that was to take them to Algeria, delaying the train for an hour before it could depart. A train carrying three hundred conscripted reservists, traveling in eastern France, was repeatedly stopped midway because soldiers pulled the emergency signal. In Toulon, several hundred reservists also prevented a train from departing.
    In addition, at the Bigneux station in the foothills of the Alps, about two hundred residents stormed into the station on the 25th to prevent a train carrying reservists from departing. In Antibes, on the 24th, about two hundred people demonstrated as a train carrying reservists left, holding signs reading "Negotiate," "Peace in Algeria," and the like. Two city councilors were among the demonstrators.

    法国人民反对在阿尔及利亚的镇压
    新华社27日讯　巴黎消息：越来越多的法国士兵和人民举行示威，抗议政府在阿尔及利亚的军事镇压行动。
    单是在五月二十四日这一天，就发生了好几起士兵的示威。当一列军车停在亚眠的时候，约有二百名士兵走出车站，在主要街道上举行游行。警察花了很大力量才把这批兵士驱回车站；在拉安，士兵们躺在要载他们去阿尔及利亚的火车前面的铁轨上，使火车耽搁了一小时才开车；有一列在法国东部开行的载着三百名应征的后备军的列车，因为士兵拉紧急信号一再在中途停车；在土伦，几百名后备军也阻止了火车开行。
    此外，在阿尔卑斯山麓的俾格诺车站，约有二百名左右的居民在二十五日冲入车站，阻止载运后备军的火车开行。在翁提布，二十四日约有二百人在装载后备军的火车离开的时候举行示威，他们拿着“谈判”，“和平和阿尔及利亚”等标语。示威者中有两个市议员。
