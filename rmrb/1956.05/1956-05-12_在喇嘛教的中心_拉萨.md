    In the center of Lamaism—Lhasa, every morning and evening, one can see rows of citizens circling the Barkhor Street, chanting scriptures and praying. At the entrance of the Jokhang Temple, there is a continuous stream of people prostrating themselves, burning incense, and lighting butter lamps, some of whom have come from as far as Qinghai, Sichuan, and Inner Mongolia. In the evening, the long Buddhist chants echo from the top of the Potala Palace and the Jokhang and Ramoche temples. A citizen named Tubdan Rinqing told us: "I am a Buddhist believer. Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the religious life of us Tibetans has consistently received respect and satisfying care."

    We recently visited the Dalai Lama's deputy scripture teacher, the Chi-Chiang Living Buddha. He received us in his own scripture hall in the Potala Palace. The Buddhist niche in the room housed nine Buddha statues and glittering scripture pagodas, and the Buddhist niches on both sides were filled with sets of scriptures wrapped in yellow cloth. The Chi-Chiang Living Buddha praised the People's Liberation Army and the personnel entering Tibet for strictly implementing the policy of protecting freedom of religious belief. He said that as a result, the unity of the Tibetan and Han nationalities has been greatly strengthened. He also specifically mentioned an incident: During the construction of the Kangzang Highway, a pagoda named "Danquli" near Deqing blocked the route of the highway. At that time, a person in charge of the Tibet Military Region came to ask for his opinion on whether the pagoda could be moved. His reply at the time was that this pagoda had a long history in the scriptures, and moving it would make the local people dissatisfied. As a result, the highway was rerouted around the pagoda. The Chi-Chiang Living Buddha said that although this was a small matter, it was enough to illustrate how the personnel entering Tibet respected local ethnic customs and habits and adopted a consultative approach in everything.

    The Chi-Chiang Living Buddha is also the principal of Lhasa Primary School. He said: "Students in the school are free to become lamas according to their wishes and will not be interfered with in any way. Buddhist students also have fixed scripture reading and prayer times every day."

    The Chi-Chiang Living Buddha mentioned that he had visited the motherland and paid homage to famous temples in various places. He saw that these temples were also protected by the state. He said that what impressed him the most was that the political status of Buddhists had been greatly improved since liberation, and they were also able to participate in national affairs. He himself is currently serving as the director of the Religious Affairs Committee in the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, which was recently established.

    The Chi-Chiang Living Buddha fully agreed with what the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni said at the inaugural meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, that freedom of religious belief and the democratic reforms to be implemented in Tibet in the future are two different things. He said that implementing democratic reforms is to turn the backward into the advanced, which is a good thing.

    We also visited the 96th successor of Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Yellow Sect, Gadan Tripa Tubden Kunga. He originally lived in the countryside, but because the number of lamas in the Gadan Monastery he presided over has gradually increased in recent years, and religious affairs have gradually become more numerous, he moved to Lhasa City. Tubden Kunga expressed his gratitude for the Central Delegation's distribution of alms to major monasteries in Lhasa, pointing out that this matter specifically demonstrates the Central Government's concern for the lives of the lamas. He said that since the opening of the Qinghai-Tibet and Kangzang highways, the amount of supplies transported has increased, alms have increased, and the lives of the lamas have also improved. He said that the number of people from all over the country who came to worship at Gadan Monastery this quarter has increased by two or three times compared to the past; the number of people participating in the Great Prayer Festival this year was more than 20,000, an increase of 5,000 over last year.

    When we visited various temples with the Central Delegation, these temples were filled with a peaceful atmosphere, and all the Buddha halls were cleaned very neatly. Many Buddha halls were lit with thousands of butter lamps and decorated with "Torma" food offerings made of zanba flour. The lamas were living their religious lives normally, and the scripture depositories of many temples were filled with newly carved printing plates. Members of the Central Delegation who believed in Buddhism visited major temples after arriving in Lhasa. Gara Tenzin, a member of the delegation and vice president of the Buddhist Association of China, had longed to visit Lhasa before liberation, but never succeeded. This time, he said excitedly: "My long-cherished wish for many years has finally been fulfilled."

    在喇嘛教的中心——拉萨
    新华社记者　包小白　格来
    在喇嘛教的中心——拉萨市，每天早晨和黄昏可以看到排成一列的市民，绕着八角街在转经念佛。在大昭寺的门口，陆续不断地有人去叩长头、烧香和点酥油灯，其中有从青海、四川、内蒙古等地远道而来的。到了傍晚，布达拉宫顶上和大、小昭寺里就响起了悠长的佛号声。一个叫做吐丹仁青的市民对我们说：“我是一个信佛的人，自西藏和平解放后，我们藏民的宗教生活一贯地得到了尊重和如愿的关怀。”
    我们最近访问了达赖喇嘛的副经师赤江活佛。他在布达拉宫的一所他自己的经堂内接待了我们。屋内佛阁里供奉的九个佛像和金光闪闪的经塔，两侧的佛阁里放满了用黄布包着的成套经卷。赤江活佛赞扬进藏的人民解放军和工作人员严格地执行了保护宗教信仰自由的政策。他说，由于这样，大大加强了藏汉民族的团结。他还特地讲起了一件事情：在修筑康藏公路的时候，德庆附近有一座名叫“丹曲里”的佛塔挡住了公路的路线。当时西藏军区的一个负责人来征求他的意见，能不能把这座塔迁移一下。他当时的回答是这座塔在经典上有悠久的历史，迁移了会使当地人民不满。结果，公路绕着塔另辟了一条路线。赤江活佛说，这虽是一件小事，但足以说明进藏人员如何尊重当地民族的风俗习惯和有事采取协商的态度。
    赤江活佛是拉萨小学的校长，他说：“学校的学生根据他们的志愿，可以自由地去当喇嘛，不会受到任何干涉。信奉佛教的学生每天还有固定的念经和祈祷时间。”
    赤江活佛提起他曾到祖国内地参观，朝拜了各地著名的寺庙。他看到这些寺庙同样受到国家的保护。他说使他感触最深的是佛教徒的政治地位解放以后大大地提高，也能够参与国家大事了。他自己在最近成立的西藏自治区筹备委员会中，就担任了宗教事务委员会的主任。
    赤江活佛完全同意达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼在西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会上所说的，宗教信仰自由和将来要在西藏实行的民主改革是两回事。他说，实行民主改革是要使落后的变成先进的，这是一件好事。
    我们还访问了黄教创始人宗喀巴第九十六代的继承人噶丹赤巴·土登滚噶。他原来住在乡下，因为他主持的噶丹寺的喇嘛近年来逐渐增加，宗教事务也逐渐繁多，他就搬到拉萨市来住。土登滚噶对中央代表团这次向拉萨各大寺院布施表示感谢，他指出这件事情就具体说明中央对喇嘛们的生活的关心。他说，青藏、康藏两条公路修通以后，运来的物资增加了，布施也多了，喇嘛们的生活也得到提高。他说，今年一个季度各地到噶丹寺来朝拜的人数，比过去增加了两三倍；今年参加传召的人数有二万多，比去年增加了五千人。
    我们随着中央代表团到各寺庙访问的时候，这些寺庙充满着一片宁静的气氛，各个佛殿都打扫得非常整洁。许多佛殿点起了千百盏酥油灯，摆设了用?粑面搓成的“多玛”食神。喇嘛们正常地过着他们的宗教生活，许多寺庙的藏经处堆满了新刻的印经板。中央代表团中信仰佛教的团员，到了拉萨以后，参拜了各大寺庙。代表团团员、中国佛教协会副会长噶喇藏在解放以前就渴望到拉萨朝拜，终未成功。这次，他兴奋地说：“已经达到了我个人多年的宿愿。”
