How Long Must We Wait?

　　Britain is Annoyed

　　It is said that Britain is annoyed with the United States' attitude on the "embargo" issue. During the talks between Eden and Eisenhower in early February this year, the United States promised Britain to "immediately" review the list of goods "embargoed" to China, and promised to "regularly review" this list in the future. However, more than three months have passed. This promise is still a blank check. The "Paris Coordinating Committee," the agency that implements the U.S. "embargo" policy, has not held a single meeting to date, and the United States has not indicated that it will hold such a meeting. U.S. officials say they don't know when the United States will respond to Britain's memorandum, submitted more than three months ago, regarding easing the "embargo" on China.

　　Western Europe Sympathizes with Britain

　　Britain's indignation is widely sympathized with in Western Europe. Like many countries in the world, Western Europe has long realized that the "embargo" on China is unrealistic. It is not China that is bound by the U.S. "embargo" policy, but those countries that are called U.S. "allies." The "Economist" magazine published in Frankfurt, West Germany, wrote in late April: The embargo on China is "not only unrealistic for Britain, but also for other Western European countries. In France and the Federal Republic, people think it is time to lift the embargo."

　　Meaningful Silence

　　Therefore, as the "New York Times" reported, Dulles' speech on Far Eastern issues at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting "was met with meaningful silence." Dulles told the "allies" that the United States' policy toward China would never change. Dulles believes that it is better to starve the Western European countries than to make Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee, who live on U.S. "aid," "feel worried." It is said that Dulles used these words to answer British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, who had suggested reducing the Western export "embargo" list.

　　However, the "meaningful" silence of the Western European "allies" is not only because they are disappointed with the United States' attitude.

　　Strange Coincidence

　　Not long ago, as Reuters said, there was "a strange coincidence." On the same day that the Soviet-British communiqué announced the expansion of Soviet-British trade, the United States also relaxed its exports to the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. The U.S. Department of Commerce published a list of more than 700 items that can be exported to these countries without the need for a separate export license. At the same time, news revealed that trade between the United States and the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries is increasing. In the first quarter of this year, the United States issued export licenses to the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, including goods worth $8.65 million, about three times more than the average figure last year.

　　The United States is Not Without Interest

　　This situation shows that the United States itself is not without interest in trading with socialist countries. The natural question is: If so, why does the United States insist on other countries implementing an embargo? Harold Wilson of the British Labour Party recently said something that represents the general view of Western European business circles on this issue. Wilson said: Because of the "hysteria of a few people" in the United States, "we cannot enter the Chinese market, but it is certain that once it is open, the Americans will outperform us in this regard."

　　How Long Must We Wait?

　　Western European countries are now asking: How long must they wait? However, the answer to the question lies less in the hands of the United States than in the hands of the Western European countries themselves. If they are unwilling to let the United States suffocate them with the "embargo" to the point where they cannot compete with the United States in the world market, they will find a way to jump out of the "embargo" trap. In this regard, more than one country has taken actions with realistic lessons.

### 还要等待到几时

    还要等待到几时
    英国感到恼火
    据说，英国对于美国在“禁运”问题上的态度感到恼火。在今年二月初艾登和艾森豪威尔举行会谈的时候，美国曾经答应英国“立即”审查对中国的“禁运”货单，并且答应以后“定期审查”这张货单。可是三个多月过去了。这个诺言还是一张空头支票。执行美国“禁运”政策的机构“巴黎统筹委员会”至今没有举行过一次会议，美国也没有表示要举行这样的一次会议。美国官员们说，他们还不知道要到什么时候，美国才会对英国在三个多月前提出的关于放松对中国的“禁运”的备忘录提出答复。
    西欧同情英国
    英国的这种忿慨得到西欧的普遍同情。像世界上许多国家一样，西欧也早就认识到，对中国的“禁运”是不现实的。被美国对中国的“禁运”政策束缚住了的并不是中国，而是那些被称为美国“盟国”的国家。西德法兰克福出版的“经济学家”杂志在四月下旬写道：对中国的禁运“不仅对于英国来说是不现实的，而且对于其他西欧国家来说也是不现实的。在法国和联邦共和国中，人们认为现在是取消禁运的时候了。”
    意味深长的沉默
    因此，如“纽约时报”所报道的，杜勒斯在北大西洋集团理事会上关于远东问题的发言“受到了意味深长的沉默的对待”。杜勒斯告诉“盟国”说，美国对中国的政策决不改变。杜勒斯认为，宁可使西欧国家饿肚子，也不能使蒋介石、李承晚这些靠美“援”过日子的人“感到忧虑”。据说，杜勒斯这些话是用来回答英国外交大臣劳埃德的。劳埃德曾经要求建议缩减西方的出口“禁运”货单。
    然而，西欧“盟国”的沉默之所以“意味深长”，不仅仅是因为它们对美国的态度感到失望。
    奇怪的巧合
    不久之前，正如路透社所说的，发生了“一个奇怪的巧合”。在苏英会谈公报宣布苏英贸易将要扩大的同一天，美国也放宽了对苏联和东欧国家的输出。美国商务部公布了一张可以输往这些国家而不必领取单独出口许可证的七百多种物资的货单。同时消息透露说，美国和苏联以及东欧国家的贸易正在增加。今年第一季度美国发出的对苏联和东欧国家输出许可证，包括价值865万美元的物资，比去年的平均数字大约增加三倍。
    美国并非没有兴趣
    这种情况说明，美国自己对于同社会主义国家进行贸易，并不是没有兴趣的。自然而然的问题是：既然这样，美国为什么硬要其它国家实行禁运呢？英国工党的哈罗德·威尔逊不久以前说的一番话，代表了西欧工商界对这个问题的普遍看法。威尔逊说：由于美国“少数歇斯底里的人的原故，我们就不能进入中国的市场，但是可以肯定地说，它一旦开放，美国人就会在这方面胜过我们”。
    还要等待到几时
    西欧国家现在在问：它们还要等待到几时？但是，问题的答案与其说是在美国手里，不如说是在西欧国家自己手里。如果它们不愿意让美国用“禁运”把它们窒息到不能在世界市场上同美国竞争的地步，它们就会找到跳出“禁运”圈套的办法。在这方面，已经有不止一个国家作出过有现实教训意义的行动了。
