Xinhua News Agency, Moscow dispatch from TASS—It was previously reported that five crew members of the former Soviet oil tanker "Tuapse" returned to the Soviet Union from the United States on April 7th. They had been sent to the United States after the "Tuapse" oil tanker was hijacked by Chiang Kai-shek elements on the high seas in 1954.

When these five crew members left the United States, staff members of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations went to New York's "Idlewild" Airport to see them off. Subsequently, on April 25th, the Soviet Embassy in the United States received a note from the U.S. State Department. The note insisted that the action of the Soviet delegation staff to see off their compatriots constituted interference with the crew members and that their action exceeded their authority.

The Soviet Embassy in the United States replied to the U.S. State Department on April 30th, stating that the Soviet government disagreed with the unfounded accusations made by the U.S. State Department in the aforementioned note. The reply pointed out that when nine crew members of the "Tuapse" were sent to the United States, the U.S. State Department repeatedly prevented Soviet Embassy personnel from meeting with them. It was not until the aforementioned five crew members made a request to Soviet Ambassador Zarubin for assistance in returning home that Soviet Embassy personnel were able to handle the procedures for their return. Moreover, when the Soviet crew members boarded the plane to return home, the U.S. immigration authorities subjected them to rude and unreasonable questioning at the airport, which provided ample reason to believe that the Soviet sailors were leaving the United States completely voluntarily. Furthermore, Soviet citizens had fully completed all the necessary procedures stipulated by U.S. immigration laws when leaving the United States. Therefore, the U.S. note's claim of "interference" by the Soviet delegation staff in the aforementioned matter is unfounded.

In its reply, the Soviet Embassy firmly demanded the removal of obstacles preventing the remaining four sailors of the Soviet "Tuapse" oil tanker, who are still being detained in the United States, from returning home, and to make it possible for them to freely resolve the issue of returning to their motherland.

### 苏联复照驳斥美国国务院的无理指责

　　苏联复照驳斥美国国务院的无理指责
    新华社据塔斯社讯　前已报道，前苏联油船“图阿普斯号”的五名船员在四月七日从美国回到了苏联。他们是在1954年“图阿普斯号”油船在公海上遭到蒋介石分子劫夺以后被送到美国去的。
    当这五名船员离开美国的时候，苏联驻联合国代表团的工作人员曾经到纽约的“艾德威尔德”飞机场送行。随后，在四月二十五日，苏联驻美国大使馆接到了美国国务院的一份照会。照会硬把苏联驻联合国代表团的工作人员为自己的同胞送行，说成是对船员进行干涉，硬说他们的这种作法超越了他们权限。
    苏联驻美国大使馆在四月三十日复照美国国务院，表示苏联政府不同意美国国务院在上述照会中提出的毫无根据的指责。复照指出，当“图阿普斯号”的九名船员被送到美国的时候，美国国务院一再阻止苏联大使馆人员同他们会面。直到上述五名船员向苏联大使查鲁宾提出了帮助他们回国的请求以后，苏联大使馆人员才能为他们办理回国手续。而当苏联船员乘飞机回国的时候，美国移民当局在机场上还对他们进行了粗暴无理的讯问，这使人有充分理由相信，苏联海员离开美国是完全自愿的。而且，苏联公民在离开美国的时候是完全履行了美国移民法律所规定的一切必要手续的。因此，美国照会中关于苏联驻联合国代表团人员对上述事情进行“干涉”的说法是没有根据的。
    苏联大使馆在复照中坚决要求排除阻碍现在仍被扣留在美国的苏联“图阿普斯号”油船的其余四名海员回家的障碍，并使他们有可能自由解决回返祖国的问题。
