    Our people are celebrating this year's "May Day" International Labor Day in the midst of a socialist upsurge. Over the past year, socialism has achieved a series of decisive victories in our country. These victories have greatly strengthened the power of our people to defend world peace and greatly strengthened the power of the entire socialist camp.
    The socialist upsurge in our country began with the rapid development of the agricultural cooperativization movement. As of the end of March, the number of peasant households joining agricultural production cooperatives accounted for 90% of the total number of peasant households in the country, and the number of peasant households participating in advanced cooperatives accounted for 55% of the total number of peasant households in the country. Socialism has basically occupied the vast rural front. The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and handicrafts is also very rapid. In just a few months, the vast majority of cities across the country have implemented joint state-private ownership of all trades of capitalist industry and commerce on the basis of the voluntary participation of capitalist industrialists and businessmen, fundamentally changing capitalist ownership. Handicrafts have also basically been brought into the orbit of cooperativization. People can see that socialist relations of production are in an absolutely dominant position not only in industry, but also in agriculture and commerce; not only in cities, but also in the vast countryside. Without a large number of agricultural machines, rapidly attracting hundreds of millions of peasants to consciously and voluntarily participate in cooperatives; relying on methods of persuasion and education, peacefully transforming capitalist industry and commerce; this is a great creation of our people, this is a great achievement of the flexible and creative application of Marxism-Leninism based on China's specific conditions.
    As the broad masses of the people see the bright and splendid prospects of socialist society more clearly and more specifically, their enthusiasm and creativity in striving to build socialism are also rising. In recent months, new atmospheres of courageous advance and new high tides of production have emerged in industrial and mining enterprises, transportation, and basic construction departments. Conservative ideas cannot stand their ground, and backward quotas and outdated technical standards have been broken through and revised one after another. Some workers who had not been mobilized in previous years of competition and the movement to increase production and practice economy, and some engineering and technical personnel who rarely participated in mass movements, have been mobilized. A good atmosphere of advanced elements leading the backward and the backward learning from the advanced, and the close integration of technical personnel and workers has gradually formed. The completion of industrial production and basic construction plans in the first quarter of this year is better than in any previous year. After the peasants formed agricultural production cooperatives, their enthusiasm for production soared to unprecedented heights. The amount of fertilizer accumulated in various regions far exceeds the amount in the past; in some regions, the number of water wells dug and canals opened in a few months exceeds the total number in the past many years. As long as there are no unexpected major disasters, the output of this year's crops will definitely have a significant increase.
    We are faced with the major task of completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and overfulfilling it. Workers, peasants, and working intellectuals should redouble their efforts to actively and steadily raise our country's industrial and agricultural production and scientific and technological research work to a new level. Although the completion of the state plan in the first quarter of this year was better than in previous years, in terms of industrial production, products such as crude oil, steel, steel products, and vegetable oil have not yet completed the plan; more than 80% of the basic construction investment plan still needs to be completed in the second, third, and fourth quarters. In terms of agricultural production, the harvest of autumn crops still depends on the efforts of the next six months. Therefore, leading cadres of industrial and mining enterprises, transportation, and basic construction units must strengthen their leadership over the movement of advanced producers and advanced workers, and implement the central government's policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" in a more comprehensive and accurate manner, and overcome tendencies such as blindly pursuing quantity and speed, neglecting quality, and disregarding safety. Leading cadres in various enterprise departments must strive to improve the operation and management of enterprises, do a good job in the specific organizational work of promoting advanced experiences, and support and help the staff and workers to realize rationalization proposals in various aspects, and guide the enthusiasm of the staff and workers to solve various major key problems in production. All party work in rural areas must revolve around the central task of helping peasants increase production and increase income, and strive to avoid various non-productive expenditures and reduce various non-productive activities. At the same time, in conjunction with current production activities, the existing agricultural production cooperatives should be thoroughly consolidated: establish and improve various internal systems of the cooperatives, resolutely implement the investment policy of benefiting both public and private interests and benefiting both middle and poor peasants, so as to fully exploit the labor potential and material potential of the peasants, which is the most reliable guarantee for completing this year's agricultural production increase plan. The vast number of staff and workers in the commercial sector must improve their operation and management work, strengthen planning, overcome blindness, and ensure the needs of urban and rural people, especially the vast number of peasants, for means of production and means of livelihood. The staff and workers of joint state-private enterprises must assist the government in actively and steadily doing a good job in economic restructuring, so that joint state-private enterprises can play a greater role in the country's construction work.
    To complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it, to build a socialist industrial country in our country, while striving to increase production, we must fully care for the personal interests of the broad masses of the people. Correctly handling the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, so that the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual can be fully developed, is one of the basic contents of the party's political work and economic work.
    The Chinese Communist Party has always paid attention to the close combination of the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual. On the one hand, we regard the interests of the state and the collective as the highest interests, and constantly educate the masses to subordinate individual interests to the interests of the state and the collective, because without the interests of the state and the collective, the individual's interests would lose their fundamental guarantee. But on the other hand, it is necessary to gradually increase the individual income of laborers, develop the welfare undertakings of laborers, and raise the material and cultural living standards of the people on the basis of production development. Over the past few years, the party and the state have done a lot of work in taking care of individual interests, stabilizing prices, adjusting wages, and implementing labor insurance. These measures have significantly improved the living standards of our country's workers, peasants, and state organ staff. However, there are not without shortcomings in this regard. In the past year or two, the wages of staff and workers have not been adjusted in a timely manner, new and reasonable reward systems have not been established in a timely manner, and some leaders have not paid enough attention to the difficulties in the lives of the masses. These shortcomings have, to a certain extent, affected the production enthusiasm of the masses. The party and the government must immediately begin to solve these problems, so that individual interests and collective interests can be better coordinated. This is an important measure to promote the continued and comprehensive upsurge of socialist construction.
    The party and the government should better care for the lives and welfare of workers, peasants, staff, educators, scientific and cultural workers, and administrative personnel. This year, wages will be generally adjusted across the country, which is a concrete manifestation of the state's concern for the lives of all staff and workers. Party organizations, trade union organizations, and administrative leadership at all levels should ensure that this work is done well. At the same time, labor protection should be strengthened in the socialist competition movement, and the work related to the vital interests of the masses such as canteens, dormitories, and nurseries should be improved, so that these tasks can be supervised by the masses. In our enterprises and organs, we should establish a good atmosphere of caring for the lives of the masses and oppose the bureaucratic style of indifference to the suffering of the masses. Continuously improving the lives of the peasants is also a very important issue. Now that the problem of agricultural cooperativization has been basically solved, and the problem of agricultural production has also been planned, the party's attention should be turned to the issue of increasing the individual income of peasants, that is, the issue of income distribution of agricultural production cooperatives. Agricultural cooperatives must support national construction, agricultural cooperatives must have public accumulation, but at the same time, it must also be guaranteed that the vast majority of cooperative members can increase their income year by year, so as to continuously improve the living standards of the peasants, so that the peasants can directly benefit from cooperativization, thereby continuously increasing the enthusiasm for expanding production.
    From now until the end of this year, there are still more than half a year. As long as we can work together in all aspects, as long as we can better care for the lives of the masses, and as long as we can give full play to various positive factors, we will surely be able to achieve greater achievements in the next six months or more.

### 在社会主义高潮中

    在社会主义高潮中
    我国人民在社会主义高潮中庆祝今年的“五一”国际劳动节。一年以来，社会主义在我国取得了一连串的决定性的胜利。这些胜利，大大地加强了我国人民保卫世界和平的力量，大大地加强了整个社会主义阵营的力量。
    我国的社会主义高潮，是从农业合作化运动的飞快发展开始的。截至三月底为止，加入农业生产合作社的农户已占全国总农户的90％，参加高级合作社的农户已占全国总农户的55％。社会主义已经基本上占领了广大的农村阵地。对资本主义工商业和手工业的社会主义改造也非常迅速。仅仅几个月的时间，全国绝大多数城市中的资本主义工商业，在资本主义工商业者自愿的基础上，实行了全行业的公私合营，基本上改变了资本主义所有制。手工业也基本上纳入了合作化的轨道。人们可以看到，社会主义的生产关系，不仅在工业中，而且在农业和商业中；不仅在城市中，而且在广大农村中，都已经居于绝对优势的地位了。在没有大量的农业机械的条件下，迅速地吸引几亿农民自觉自愿地参加合作社；依靠说服教育的方法，和平地改造了资本主义工商业；这是我国人民的伟大创举，这是根据中国具体情况灵活地创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的巨大成就。
    当着广大人民群众更加清楚更加具体地看到了社会主义社会光辉灿烂的前景的时候，他们为建设社会主义而奋斗的积极性和创造性也就更加高涨了。几个月来，无论工矿企业、交通运输和基本建设部门，都出现了勇敢前进的新气象和生产的新高潮。保守思想站不住脚跟了，落后的定额，过时的技术标准，纷纷地被突破、被修改了。在历年的竞赛运动和增产节约运动中没有发动起来的一些工人，某些很少参加群众运动的工程技术人员，都被发动起来了。先进带动落后，落后学习先进，技术人员和工人密切结合的良好风气已经逐渐形成。今年第一季度工业生产和基本建设计划完成的情况，比哪一年都要好。农民们组成农业生产合作社以后，生产情绪空前高涨。各个地区积攒的肥料，大大超过过去的数量；有些地区几个月内打的水井、开的水渠，超过过去多少年的总和。只要没有意外的重大灾害，今年农作物的产量，一定会有显著的增加。
    我们面前摆着提前和超额完成五年计划的重大任务。工人、农民和劳动知识分子应该加倍地努力，积极地、稳步地把我国的工农业生产和科学技术研究工作提高到新的水平。今年第一季度完成国家计划的情况，虽然比往年要好，但是在工业生产方面，像原油、钢、钢材、植物油等产品还没有完成计划；基本建设投资计划也还有80％以上，要在二、三、四季度完成。农业生产方面，秋季作物的收获也还要靠今后半年的努力。因此，工矿企业、交通运输和基本建设单位的领导干部，要加强对先进生产者和先进工作者运动的领导，更全面、更准确地贯彻执行中央“又多、又快、又好、又省”的方针，克服盲目贪多求快、忽视质量、不顾安全等偏向。各个企业部门的领导干部必须努力改进企业的经营管理，做好推广先进经验的具体组织工作，从各方面支持和帮助职工群众实现合理化建议，把职工群众的热情引导到解决生产中各种重大关键问题上来。农村中党的一切工作都要围绕着帮助农民增加生产增加收入这个中心任务，竭力避免各种非生产的开支，减少各种非生产的活动。同时应该结合当前的生产活动，把现有的农业生产合作社加以切实的整顿：建立和健全合作社内部的各种制度，坚决地贯彻公私两利，中农、贫农两利的投资政策，以便充分地发挥农民的劳动潜力和物质潜力，这是完成今年农业增产计划的最可靠的保证。商业部门的广大职工要改善经营管理工作，加强计划性，克服盲目性，保证城乡人民、特别是广大农民对生产资料和生活资料的需要。公私合营企业的职工要协助政府积极地、稳步地作好经济改组工作，使公私合营企业在国家建设工作中发挥更大的作用。
    要提前和超额完成五年计划，要在我国建成一个社会主义的工业国家，在努力提高生产的同时，必须充分关心广大人民的个人利益。正确地处理国家、集体和个人的关系，使国家的、集体的和个人的利益都能得到充分的发展，这是党的政治工作和经济工作的基本内容之一。
    中国共产党一向是注意国家利益、集体利益和个人利益的密切结合的。一方面，我们把国家利益、集体利益当做最高利益，随时教育群众以个人利益服从国家利益和集体利益，因为没有国家和集体的利益，个人的利益就失去了根本的保障。但是另一方面，必须在生产发展的基础上，逐步地增加劳动者个人的收入，发展劳动者的福利事业，提高人民的物质生活和文化生活的水平。几年以来，党和国家在照顾个人利益方面做了很多工作，稳定物价、调整工资、实行劳动保险，这种种措施使我国的工人、农民、国家机关工作人员的生活水平有了显著的提高。但是，在这方面并不是没有缺点。最近一两年来，职工的工资没有及时调整，新的合理的奖励制度没有及时建立起来，某些领导者对群众生活中的困难关心不够。这些缺点，曾经在一定程度上影响了群众的生产积极性。党和政府必须立即着手解决这些问题，使个人利益和集体利益得到更好的配合，这是促进社会主义建设事业继续全面高涨的一个重要措施。
    党和政府应该更好地关心工人、农民、职员、教育工作者、科学文化工作人员和行政人员等的生活福利。今年将在全国范围内普遍地调整工资，这是国家关心全体职工生活的具体表现。各级党组织、工会组织和行政领导方面，应该保证做好这一工作。同时要在社会主义竞赛运动中加强劳动保护，改善食堂、宿舍、托儿所等有关群众切身利益的工作，使这些工作都能受到群众的监督。在我们的企业和机关中，应该树立起关心群众生活的好风气，反对那种对群众疾苦漠不关心的官僚主义作风。不断改善农民的生活，同样是一个很重大的问题。现在，农业合作化的问题已经基本解决了，农业生产的问题也已经有了规划，党的注意力应该转到增加农民个人收入的问题，即农业生产合作社收益分配问题。农业合作社必须支援国家建设，农业合作社必须有公共积累，但是，也必须同时保证极大多数的合作社员都能逐年增加收入，以便不断地提高农民的生活水平，使农民直接得到合作化的利益，从而不断地增加扩大生产的积极性。
    从现在起到今年年底，还有大半年的时间。只要我们能在各个方面共同努力，只要我们能更好地关心群众的生活，只要我们能充分发挥各种积极因素，就一定能在今后半年多的时间中，获得更大的成就。
