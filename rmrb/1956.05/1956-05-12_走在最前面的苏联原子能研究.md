    Soviet Academician Kurchatov, an authority on atomic energy research, published an article and conversation in the newspapers "Pravda" and "Izvestia" on May 10, concerning the prospects of using atomic energy to generate electricity and creating thermonuclear reactions. Kurchatov recently visited the United Kingdom with Soviet leaders and gave a speech at the Harwell Atomic Energy Research Establishment in the United Kingdom. His speech caused a sensation in British scientific circles. The first part of his speech discussed the development of atomic power in the Soviet Union, and the second part discussed the possibility of creating thermonuclear reactions.

    Regarding the development prospects of Soviet atomic power, Kurchatov said that the Soviet Union has proposed the task of establishing atomic power, which, at least under the conditions of the European part of the Soviet Union, will be more economical than coal-fired power. It is planned to initially build huge atomic power stations with a capacity of 400,000 to 600,000 kilowatts each in order to accumulate experience in the large-scale production and processing of nuclear fuel, and to examine which equipment is safer for the surrounding residents.

    In addition to the huge atomic power stations, Kurchatov said that in 1959-1960, the Soviet Union will construct and complete several experimental atomic facilities, each with a capacity of 50,000 to 70,000 kilowatts. These facilities include: a thermal neutron reactor using water as a moderator, with a turbine utilizing steam from the reactor with relatively weak radioactivity; a homogeneous reactor suitable for the cyclical expansion and reproduction of nuclear fuels uranium-233 or thorium-232; a thermal neutron reactor with graphite as a moderator and sodium for heat removal; and a fast neutron reactor cooled by sodium for the cyclical expansion and reproduction of nuclear fuels plutonium-239 or uranium-238.

    What does it mean to expand the reproduction of fuel? Kurchatov said that the nuclear fuel burned in the reactor, unlike ordinary coal and oil, can produce new substances—"plutonium" and uranium-233, which are not naturally produced, but are also nuclear fuels. This is the so-called nuclear fuel reproduction process. The quantity of new substances formed depends on the conditions of the nuclear chain reaction. If the quantity of new nuclear fuel formed is greater than the quantity of nuclear raw materials consumed in the chain reaction, then it is an expanded reproduction process.

    Kurchatov said: Theoretical and experimental work carried out in the fields of atomic physics and nuclear physics in recent years has led to the discovery of new ways to peacefully utilize atomic energy. The new discovery he referred to is the thermonuclear reaction, in which the energy released in the atomic nucleus is not due to the fission of heavy atomic nuclei of uranium or thorium, but the result of the fusion of light nuclei of substances such as heavy hydrogen or tritium (a rare form of hydrogen). He said: We are now able to create conditions for turning heavy hydrogen into helium in a hydrogen bomb. But in order to control this reaction, it is necessary to find a way to make it not bring about a huge destructive explosion. Solving this task will free mankind from constantly worrying about the reserves of energy necessary for survival on Earth.

    Thermonuclear reactions can only occur when the temperature of a substance is so high that, during nuclear collisions, thermal motion can overcome the strong repulsive electrical force existing between the nuclei. Therefore, before a thermonuclear reaction can occur, the temperature of the substance must be raised to several million degrees. At such temperatures, heavy hydrogen can only exist in the form of "plasma" (a medium composed of electrons and nuclei that have lost electrons). The energy stored in the "plasma," although the temperature has been raised enough to make the thermonuclear reaction strong enough, is still not large. When the temperature is one million degrees, the thermal energy stored in one gram of heavy hydrogen is only a few kilowatt-hours. Therefore, if such a method of heating "plasma" is used, both the accumulation of thermal energy and the generation of strong thermonuclear reactions can be ensured. The main difficulty now lies in eliminating the huge heat loss when the temperature reaches tens of thousands of degrees, because it is practically impossible to further increase the temperature without thermal isolation.

    Kurchatov also mentioned some other difficulties overcome by Soviet scientists, such as how to overcome the strong mechanical forces generated by gradually increasing atmospheric pressure, and how to use magnetic fields to deal with the rapid emission of protons when heating heavy hydrogen.

    He said: Soviet physicists have accumulated experience in studying the passage of strong currents through various gases. From these experiences, they have studied the phenomena that occur when strong currents pass through hydrogen, heavy hydrogen, and other gases of varying densities. Some experiments have confirmed that when the maximum strength of the current reaches 2 million amperes, the energy generated by discharge in a very short time is ten times the power generation of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station. Experiments have shown that when a current of hundreds of thousands of amperes passes through a rarefied gas, it is actually possible to raise the temperature of a soft wire made of "plasma" to one million degrees. Under laboratory conditions, no one had ever reached such a high temperature before. Only in hydrogen bombs can higher temperatures be reached. But in this case, the observer cannot be within a few kilometers of the explosion site. However, experiments have shown that the thin stream of red-hot "plasma" enclosed in the charging box is not dangerous to the people around it, because it contains only a very small amount of substance.

    Kurchatov said: Whether a controllable and powerful thermonuclear reactor can be built along this path requires further research. At the same time, other methods should be studied to solve this major task. (Moscow, 10th, This Newspaper)

### 走在最前面的苏联原子能研究

    走在最前面的苏联原子能研究
    苏联研究原子能的权威库尔查托夫院士五月十日在“真理报”和“消息报”上发表了关于利用原子能发电和创立热核子反应的前途的论文和谈话。库尔查托夫不久前随苏联领导人访问英国的时候，在英国哈威尔原子能科学研究中心作了演讲。他的演讲在英国科学界中引起了轰动。他的演讲的第一部分谈苏联原子电力发展问题，第二部分谈创立热核子反应的可能性问题。
    关于苏联原子电力的发展前途，库尔查托夫说，苏联提出建立原子电力的任务，至少在苏联欧洲部分的条件下它将比煤电力经济。打算在初期建设每座四十到六十万瓩的巨大原子能发电站，以便积累大规模生产核子燃料和对它加工的经验，以便考查哪些设备对于周围居民更为安全。
    除了巨大的原子能发电站以外，库尔查托夫说，在1959—1960年苏联将建设和建成若干每座五万到七万瓩的试验性的原子设备。这些设备包括：用水减速的热中子反应堆，带有利用从反应堆出来的放射性较弱的蒸汽的透平；适于循环扩大再生产核子燃料铀二三三或钍二三二的均匀的反应堆；带有用石墨制的减速器和用钠消热的热中子反应堆；为了循环扩大再生产核子燃料钚二三九或铀二三八用钠冷却的快速中子反应堆。
    什么叫做扩大再生产燃料呢？库尔查托夫说，在反应堆中烧掉的核子燃料，不同于普通的煤和石油，可以得到新的物质——“钚”和铀二三三，它们不是天然产生的，它们也是核子燃料。这就是所谓核子燃料再生产过程。新的物质形成的数量决定于核子连锁反应的条件。如果形成的新核子燃料的数量，多过在连锁反应中消耗的核子原料的数量，那就是扩大再生产过程。
    库尔查托夫说：最近几年来在原子物理学和核子物理学领域内所进行的理论和试验工作已经导致和平利用原子能的新途径的发现。他所指的新发现就是热核子反应，在这连锁反应中，蕴藏在原子核中的能的放出，不是靠铀或钍的重原子核的分裂，而是由像重氢或三氢（氢的稀有的变形）这样的物质的轻核聚变的结果。他说：我们现在能够在氢弹中造成把重氢变成氦的条件。但是为了能够驾御这种反应，还需要寻找使它不带来巨大的摧毁性的爆炸的方法。这个任务的解决将使人类不必经常担心在地球上生存所必需的能的蕴藏量。
    热核子反应只有在下列情况下才能发生，就是物质的温度高到这样的程度，使得核子碰撞的时候，由于热运动，能够克服在核子之间存在的强大的拒斥性的电力。因此，在热核子反应发生前，应该把物质的温度提高几百万度。在这样的温度下，重氢只能以“普拉兹玛”（由电子和失去电子的原子核组成的媒介物）的形式存在。集中在“普拉兹玛”内的能的藏量，虽然当温度已经提高到使热核子反应足够强烈的时候，仍然是不大的。当温度在一百万度时，储蓄在一克重氢中的热能，只有几个瓩时。所以，如果利用这样的把“普拉兹玛”加热的办法，既可以保证热能的积蓄，也可以产生强力的热核子反应。现在主要的困难在于，消除温度达到几万度时的巨大热耗，因为在没有热隔离的情况下进一步提高温度在事实上是不可能的。
    库尔查托夫还提到苏联科学家所克服的一些其他的困难，如怎样克服由逐渐提高的大气压力所产生的强大的机械力，怎样用磁场来处理重氢加热时质子飞速四射的情况等。
    他说：苏联物理学家已经积累了研究用强大电流通过各种气体的经验。从这些经验中研究出强大的电流通过各种稀薄度不同的氢、重氢和其他气体时发生的现象。一些实验证实，电流的最大力量到达二百万安培的时候，在极短时间内的放电，产生的能量为古比雪夫水电站发电量的十倍。实验表明，当几十万安培的电流通过稀薄的气体的时候，实际上能够把用“普拉兹玛”做成的软电线的温度提高到一百万度。在实验室的条件下，以前是没有人曾经达到这样高的温度的。只有在氢弹中才能达到更高的温度。但是在这种情况下，观察者不能处在爆炸地点的几公里以内。而实验表明，封闭在充电箱中的赤红的“普拉兹玛”的细流，对于周围的人是没有危险的，因为这里面只有极少量的物质。
    库尔查托夫说：循着这条道路，能否建成可以调节的强力的热核子反应堆，还要进一步研究。同时要研究用其他方法解决这个主要任务。（本报莫斯科十日电）
