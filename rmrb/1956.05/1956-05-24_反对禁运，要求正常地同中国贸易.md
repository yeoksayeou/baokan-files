Indonesia's Official Stance: Will Try Its Best to Lift the "Embargo"

    Antara News Agency reported on May 16th, citing sources from the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, that Indonesia will do its best to have the "embargo" lifted, so that it can conduct normal trade with any country in the world.
    They said that Indonesia is very concerned about the economic impact of the "embargo," and the various losses caused by this impact amount to millions of盾 (guilders) each year.
    They stated that Indonesia will definitely raise the issue of the "embargo" at the upcoming Second Asian-African Conference. They hope that the United Nations will make a decision to lift the "embargo." They said that some Western countries, such as Britain, also hope to stop the embargo; however, the United States, as an important major power in the United Nations, has so far not reconsidered this issue.
    The news said that, at the same time, Indonesian private business circles welcomed Indonesia's intention to raise the issue of the "embargo." These businessmen complained: "If it weren't for the embargo, we would be able to sell rubber to communist countries, including China, but the current and near-future situation is becoming increasingly intolerable."

Nuttings Says the List of Goods Allowed to be Exported to China is Expanding

    TASS, London, May 15th: British Labour Party Member of Parliament Shinwell asked Foreign Under-Secretary Nutting in the House of Commons on May 14th whether the British government intends "to hold further talks in the near future on the issue of trade and improved relations between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom?"
    In answering this question, Nutting said: "We recently had a detailed and valuable exchange of views with the Soviet leaders. Now, the purpose of the talks should be to see what progress can be made on the issues included in the joint statement. The Board of Trade has been in contact with the Soviet trade representative office in London regarding the Russian purchasing plan."
    Labour MPs Swingler and Chipman strongly demanded that Nutting answer the question about lifting the embargo on the People's Republic of China. Nutting replied that the list of goods allowed to be exported to the People's Republic of China is expanding.

The Contradiction between Britain and the United States Deepens on the "Embargo" Issue

    Agence France-Presse, Washington, May 17th: The British government has sent the U.S. State Department a statement made by Foreign Under-Secretary Nutting in the House of Commons regarding trade with China. Nutting told the House of Commons that talks with the United States on easing the embargo on China had not yet yielded results. In appropriate circumstances, Britain would make greater use of the "exception procedures" in the embargo regulations "in order to carry out reasonable exports to China."
    According to United Press International, Senator McClellan, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Investigating Subcommittee, issued a threat to Britain on May 17th regarding this statement. McClellan said that the United States should "investigate foreign aid programs" based on Britain's actions to expand trade with China and other communist countries. He said that this might prompt the U.S. Congress to investigate whether it is necessary to continue providing "substantial military assistance" to its allies. (Xinhua News Agency)

    反对禁运，要求正常地同中国贸易
    印度尼西亚官方表示将尽力取消“禁运”
    据安塔拉通讯社五月十六日援引印度尼西亚外交部人士的话说，印度尼西亚将尽力使“禁运”取消，使它自己能够同世界上任何国家正常地进行贸易。
    他们说，印度尼西亚对于“禁运”对它的经济影响非常关心，这种影响所造成的各种损失，每年达到成百万盾之多。
    他们表示，印度尼西亚在将来举行的第二次亚非会议上肯定将会提出“禁运”问题。他们希望联合国作出取消“禁运”的决定。他们说，某些西方国家，例如英国，也希望停止禁运；然而作为联合国中一个重要的大国的美国却到现在为止一直没有重新考虑这个问题。
    消息说，同时，印度尼西亚私人企业界人士对于印度尼西亚打算提出“禁运”问题一事表示欢迎。这些商人埋怨说：“要不是实行禁运，那我们就能够把橡胶卖给共产党国家，包括中国在内，但是目前和不久将来的情况却正在变得愈来愈加不能容忍了。”
    纳丁说允许输往中国的货物单正在扩大
    据塔斯社伦敦十五日讯：英国工党议员辛威尔五月十四日在下院向外交副大臣纳丁提出一个问题：英国政府是否打算“在最近期间继续就苏联和英国两国贸易和改善关系的问题举行进一步的会谈？”
    纳丁在回答这个问题的时候说：“我们不久前同苏联领导人进行了详尽的和有价值的交换意见。现在，会谈的目的应当是，看看在联合声明所包括的问题方面可以取得怎样的进展。贸易部已经同苏联驻伦敦的贸易代表机构就俄国购货计划进行接触。”
    工党议员斯文勒和奇普曼坚决要求纳丁回答关于取消对中华人民共和国的禁运的问题。纳丁回答说，允许输往中华人民共和国的货物单正在扩大。
    英美两国在“禁运”问题上矛盾加深
    据法新社华盛顿十七日消息：英国政府已经把外交副大臣纳丁在下院发表的关于同中国贸易问题的一篇声明送交美国国务院。纳丁向下院说，同美国举行的放宽对中国禁运的会谈还没有结果。在适当情况下，英国会更多地利用禁运规定中的“例外手续”，“以便向中国进行合理的出口”。
    据合众社报道，美国参议院调查小组委员会主席麦克利兰在五月十七日就这个声明向英国发出了威胁。麦克利兰说，美国应该依据英国要扩大同中国和其他共产党国家的贸易的行动，来“调查援外计划”。他说，这可能促使美国国会调查是否有必要继续给予各盟国“大量的军事援助”。　（据新华社讯）
