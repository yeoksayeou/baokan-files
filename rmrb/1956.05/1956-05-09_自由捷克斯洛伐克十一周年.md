　　The Eleventh Anniversary of Free Czechoslovakia
　　By Ying Wuhe, Minister of Food Industry of the Czechoslovak Republic, Member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia

    The Czechoslovak people of all nationalities are commemorating the great national holiday of the eleventh anniversary of their liberation from the oppression of German fascism. This anniversary is celebrated simultaneously with the anniversary of the victory of worldwide historical significance over Hitler's Germany. The victory over Hitler's Germany was achieved by the Soviet people and their armed forces in combat cooperation with the people of France, Britain, the United States and other countries. The liberation of Czechoslovakia is an integral part of this great victory. Brave Czechoslovak soldiers also fought for this victory.

    At the moment when all progressive mankind was preparing to greet this great victory day, Czechoslovakia had not yet gained freedom. Hitlerites were being annihilated on all fronts, and they were still trying to put up a last-ditch resistance in Berlin. In Prague, which was heavily defended by the enemy, the working people staged an uprising against an enemy who was superior in number and well-equipped with weapons. When the fascist forces began to gain the upper hand, the heroic people of Prague radioed for help to the Allied forces. Upon hearing this appeal, the Soviet army, hundreds of kilometers away from Prague, rushed to the rescue. General Rybalko's tank forces, in an unprecedentedly short period of time and through the most arduous battles, annihilated a large number of fascist troops in the Prague area and saved Prague from destruction. On May 9th, Prague and the entire Czechoslovak people were liberated and were able to celebrate this glorious victory day together with the people of all countries.

    The liberation of Czechoslovakia opened a new page in the history of the Czechoslovak people. The era of true national freedom and independence, the era of the Czechoslovak people building a new life, had arrived, thus opening up the possibility of advancing along the path of people's democracy and socialism. For eleven years, the Czechoslovak people have been building their new life. During this period, our country has grown. The chimneys of many new factories and new blast furnaces illuminate the skies of Ostrava and Kladno. Many new and huge dams have been erected on the Morava, Vltava, and Váh rivers. The lights from their power stations illuminate vast border areas. Total industrial production has more than doubled compared to the pre-war period. Beautiful Slovakia has transformed from a backward agricultural region into a highly developed industrial region. Czechoslovak workers and technicians have created with their own hands sophisticated machines and equipment that we could never manufacture in the past, earning a good reputation for Czechoslovak products throughout the world. Profound changes have also taken place in the countryside, and socialist components have taken deep root in the countryside. Czechoslovak science, art, and literature have greatly flourished in these eleven years.

    Now, Czechoslovakia is no longer a small country in Central Europe used by imperialists as a field for rivalry. It has become a strong country, thanks to the labor of all the people and because it belongs to the great socialist camp, whose borders extend from the westernmost part of Czechoslovakia all the way to Beijing.

    As we look back on the road we have traveled in the past eleven years on this great holiday, we see the tremendous role played by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. The Party's merit lies in guiding the working people along the path of Marxism-Leninism in the struggle against all enemies and traitors, and in leading the people to defend the people's democratic system. In February 1948, when the forces of domestic reaction were constantly weakened and attempted to restore the capitalist system with the help of external enemies, the people, under the leadership of the Party, smashed these attempts, drove the traitorous ministers out of the government, eliminated all obstacles, and moved more firmly along the road to socialism. The Party's merit also lies in its ability to unite the working peasants and intellectuals around the working class, to forge a friendship between our Czech and Slovak peoples, and to establish and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, the foundation of the people's democratic system. The reason why the Party has been able to achieve victory is precisely because the Party's highest criterion is to seek the welfare of the people, because the Party teaches the people and learns from the people, because the Party always relies on the strength and enthusiasm of the working class and all working people, and because the Party deeply believes in the invincibility of the masses of the people as creators of all material and spiritual wealth. Everything that the Czechoslovak people have created in the past eleven years is inseparable from the activities of the Party. With the help of the Party, the Czechoslovak people are no longer what they were eleven years ago. They are growing and changing with the construction of a new life. They have become conscious and outstanding masters of their own country. They understand the goals pointed out to them by the Party and led them to achieve. Today, at a time of large-scale socialist construction, a series of bold plans and new great victories have appeared before our people: the two-year plan to restore the national economy was successfully completed in 1948, and the first five-year plan was completed in 1953. During the first five-year plan, the per capita consumption increased by one-fifth, and industrial production increased by 102%. Following this, the Czechoslovak people, in cooperation with various friendly countries, began to enter the second five-year plan. In the second five-year plan, which takes as its starting point the possibility of further rapid development of the national economy, industrial production will be increased by another 50%. The second five-year plan also stipulates that agricultural production will be increased by 30%, and the total amount of personal consumption of residents will increase by one-third. At the same time, this plan also pays special attention to meeting the demand for livestock products and the growing demand for industrial products of superior quality. In order to realize their plans, the Czechoslovak people need a peaceful environment. Therefore, they will, as before, stand closely with their liberator, the Soviet Union, and the peace-loving people of the world, and fight for peace and security in Europe and the world. On the day of the eleventh anniversary of their liberation, on the eleventh anniversary of their free life, the Czechoslovak people once again declare to the world that they are willing to live in peace and friendship with the people of all countries. But they also make it clear that they will do everything in their power to crush any attempt to drag the people into war. The Czechoslovak people are always ready to defend their motherland. The people of the fraternal nationalities of Czechoslovakia will, together with the great Soviet people, the great Chinese people, and the people of all people's democratic countries, march towards new victories of socialism and communism.

　　自由捷克斯洛伐克十一周年
　　捷克斯洛伐克共和国食品工业部部长  捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会委员  英·乌赫
    捷克斯洛伐克各族人民正在纪念自己从德国法西斯压迫下获得解放的十一周年的伟大民族节日。这个周年纪念日是和战胜希特勒德国的全世界历史意义的胜利周年纪念日同时庆祝的。对希特勒德国的胜利，是苏联人民和他们的武装部队同法国、英国、美国和其他国家的人民在进行战斗合作之下取得的。捷克斯洛伐克的解放是这一伟大胜利的不可分割的一部分。勇敢的捷克斯洛伐克的士兵们也为这个胜利进行了斗争。
    当全体进步人类准备迎接这个伟大胜利日子的时刻，捷克斯洛伐克还没有获得自由。希特勒分子在各条战线上正在被消灭，他们在柏林还在企图进行最后的负隅顽抗。在敌人防守严密的布拉格，劳动人民举行了起义，反对拥有数量上占优势和武器精良的敌人。当法西斯军队开始占上风的时候，英勇的布拉格人民通过无线电台向盟国军队求援。离布拉格几百公里的苏军听到了这个呼吁以后，急忙地赶来援救。雷巴尔科将军的坦克部队在空前短促的时间内经过最艰苦的战斗消灭了布拉格方面的大批法西斯军队，并使布拉格免于毁灭。五月九日这一天，布拉格和全体捷克斯洛伐克人民获得解放，并且能够同各国人民一同庆祝这个光荣胜利的日子。
    捷克斯洛伐克的解放为捷克斯洛伐克人民的历史揭开了新的一页。真正的民族自由和独立的时代、捷克斯洛伐克人民建设新生活的时代到来了，这样就打开了沿着人民民主和社会主义道路前进的可能性。十一年来，捷克斯洛伐克人民建设着自己的新生活。在这段时期内，我国成长起来了。许多新的工厂的烟囱，新的炼铁高炉照耀着俄斯特拉伐和克拉德诺的天空。在摩拉瓦河、弗尔塔瓦河和发格河上耸立起了许多新的巨大的堤坝。它们的电力站发出的电流所燃亮的灯光照耀着辽阔的边区。总的工业生产量同战前时期相比增加了一倍多。美丽的斯洛伐克从一个落后的农业地区成了一个有着高度发展的工业的地区。捷克斯洛伐克工人和技术人员亲手制出了我们过去从来不能制造的完善的机器和设备，为捷克斯洛伐克的产品在全世界赢得了良好的声誉。在农村里也发生了深刻的变化，社会主义成分已经在农村里根深蒂固。捷克斯洛伐克的科学、艺术和文学在这十一年里大大繁荣了。
    现在，捷克斯洛伐克已经不是被帝国主义者当作角逐场所的中欧的小国，它已经成为一个强国了，这是由于全体人民的劳动，由于它属于伟大的社会主义阵营，这个阵营的疆界从捷克斯洛伐克的最西端一直延伸到北京。
    我们在这伟大的节日回顾十一年来走过的道路时，看到捷克斯洛伐克共产党所起的巨大作用。党的功绩在于，它在反对一切敌人和叛徒的斗争中引导劳动人民沿着马克思列宁主义的道路前进，在于它领导人民捍卫了人民民主制度。在1948年2月，当国内反动派的势力被不断地削弱而企图依靠外部敌人的帮助恢复资本主义制度的时候，人民在党的领导下粉碎了这些企图，把叛徒部长逐出政府，消除了一切障碍，更加坚强地沿着通向社会主义的道路前进。党的功绩还在于，它善于把劳动农民和知识分子团结在工人阶级周围，使我们捷克人民和斯洛伐克人民结成友谊，建立并巩固了工农联盟这一人民民主制度的基础。党所以能够取得胜利，正是由于党的最高准则是为人民谋福利，由于党教导人民并向人民学习，由于党永远依靠着工人阶级以及全体劳动人民的力量和热情，由于党深切地相信作为一切物质和精神财富创造者的人民群众的不可战胜性。捷克斯洛伐克人民在过去十一年中所创造的一切，都是和党的活动不可分的。在党的帮助下，捷克斯洛伐克人民已经不是十一年前的样子了。他们成长着，同时随着新生活的建设而变化着。他们已成为自己国家的自觉的、优秀的主人翁。他们懂得那由党向他们指出、并领导他们去完成的目标。今天，在大规模社会主义建设的时刻，我国人民面前出现了一系列的大胆计划和新的伟大胜利：1948年顺利完成了恢复国民经济的两年计划，而在1953年又完成了第一个五年计划。在第一个五年计划期间，每个人的个人消费量提高了五分之一，工业生产增加了102％，接着，捷克斯洛伐克人民在同各友好国家的合作下开始进入第二个五年计划。在以可能进一步急剧发展国民经济为出发点的第二个五年计划中，工业生产将再提高50％。第二个五年计划还规定农业的生产将提高30％，居民个人消费的总量将增加三分之一。同时这个计划还对满足畜产品的需求和对优等质量的工业品的日益增长的需求予以特别的注意。捷克斯洛伐克人民为了能实现自己的计划，就需要和平的环境。因此，他们仍将像以前一样同自己的解放者苏联和全世界爱好和平的人民紧密地站在一起，为欧洲和全世界的和平和安全而斗争。在自己的解放十一周年的日子里，在自己的自由生活的十一周年纪念日，捷克斯洛伐克人民再次向全世界宣称，他们愿意和一切国家的人民和平友爱地相处。但是他们同时也说明，他们将以全力来粉碎一切想把人民拖入战争的企图。捷克斯洛伐克人民随时准备保卫自己的祖国。捷克斯洛伐克的各兄弟民族人民将同伟大的苏联人民，伟大的中国人民和各人民民主国家的人民一起，走向社会主义和共产主义的新的胜利。
