Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The head of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry announced at the National Petroleum Industry Advanced Producers Representative Conference that opened today: The Karamay region in the Junggar Basin of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has been confirmed as a promising large oilfield.

	This oilfield is not far from the Xinjiang Petroleum Company. So far, among the four exploration wells drilled by the Ministry of Petroleum Industry's exploration personnel in this area, three have automatically gushed out brown crude oil; six of the remaining ten exploration wells being drilled also show signs of oil and gas. According to calculations by Soviet experts and geologists working in the area: the proven area alone has a very large amount of oil reserves with industrial mining value; if calculated based on this year's exploration area, the oil reserves will be several times larger than the Yumen Laojunmiao Oilfield.

	In addition, geological personnel have discovered an area with significant oil seepages 70 kilometers away from Karamay.

	Geologists estimate that due to the similar geological conditions in the above two areas, the Karamay oilfield area may expand to several thousand square kilometers.

	In order to quickly determine the oil reserves in this area and strive to produce oil as soon as possible to meet the country's oil needs, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry has now decided to further expand the scale of exploration in the Karamay Mountain area this year, and also open up a new exploration area nearby. The plan is to continue drilling from next year while simultaneously starting the overall design for the development of this oilfield and conducting small-scale exploitation.

### 石油工业部负责人宣布  克拉玛依地区是个很有希望的大油田

    石油工业部负责人宣布
    克拉玛依地区是个很有希望的大油田
    据新华社11日讯　石油工业部负责人在今天开幕的全国石油工业先进生产者代表会议上宣布：新疆维吾尔自治区的准噶尔盆地的克拉玛依地区，已经证实是一个很有希望的大油田。
    这个油田距离新疆石油公司不远。到现在为止，石油工业部的勘探人员在这个地区已经钻成的四口探井中，有三口已经自动喷出棕色原油；其余十口正在钻探的探井，也有六口已经有油气显示。据在当地工作的苏联专家和地质学家们计算：仅已经探明的面积，有工业开采价值的储油量就已经很大；如果以今年的勘探地区计算，那末储油量就将超过玉门老君庙油田好几倍。
    除此以外，地质人员还在离克拉玛依七十公里以外的地方，发现了一个有很大油苗显示的地区。
    据地质学家们估计，由于以上两个地区的地质条件相同，克拉玛依油田面积，将有可能扩展到几千平方公里以外。
    为了迅速探明这一地区的石油储量，争取及早出油满足国家的用油需要，现在，石油工业部已经决定今年将进一步扩大克拉玛依山地区的勘探规模，同时还在其附近开辟了一个新的勘探区。计划从明年起，一方面继续钻探，另一方面将开始开发这一油田的总体设计，并且进行小规模的开采。
