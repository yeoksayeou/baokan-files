　　Wishing You New Labor Achievements
　　By Yu. Timkin, Steelworker of the Chusovoy Metallurgical Plant in the Soviet Union and Deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation
    Dear Chinese worker friends! I feel infinitely honored to have the opportunity to come to your great country and attend the National Conference of Advanced Producers of China as a guest.
    We, the workers of the Soviet Union, follow with great interest your heroic labor and every achievement you have made in building a new life, and we regard these achievements as our own. Your noble aspiration to strengthen the power of your country with your labor and to contribute your valuable efforts to the struggle for socialism is close and understandable to us.
    Dear friends! I am a representative of millions of workers in our country. I graduated from vocational school in 1942 and entered the Chusovoy Metallurgical Plant at that time. I started as a third-level assistant steelworker, then a second-level assistant, and after some time, a first-level assistant. While working as an assistant, I closely observed the work of the steelworkers and carefully familiarized myself with the technical operation process of steelmaking. In four years, I basically mastered the technical procedures of steelmaking production. In 1946, I was allowed to conduct smelting independently.
    Years passed. Our factory installed new equipment and improved the steelmaking methods. I felt more and more the lack of knowledge and that I should study and improve my skills.
    In 1954, I graduated from the foreman training class attached to the Sverdlovsk Technical College. The knowledge I gained in the training class helped me in my further work. Last year, in the second quarter, my work group ranked first in the All-Soviet socialist competition among enterprises in the Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy.
    In 1955, a happy event occurred in my life. The working people of the city of Chusovoy gave me the lofty trust of electing me as a deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation. This trust of the working people has entrusted me with many tasks, first and foremost, to work well and complete and overfulfill production tasks.
    In my work, I strive to utilize all new and progressive methods to speed up metal smelting and improve quality. For example, adopting the advanced experience of Balotov, a steelworker from Nizhny Tagil, has enabled us to speed up the speed of furnace repair. Saving time in this production process can shorten the smelting time of each furnace. By adopting more progressive labor methods, our work group completed the 1955 plan one month ahead of schedule and produced 1,600 tons of steel above the target.
    We have started 1956—the first year of the Sixth Five-Year Plan—smoothly. Our work group completed the plan for the first quarter of this year on March 9.
    The 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which was held in February this year, formulated a program for further greatly developing our country's economy. Steelworkers should also make a significant contribution to the implementation of this program.
    The Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates further improving labor productivity. My assistants and I guarantee to shorten the time spent on each furnace of steel, thereby completing the tasks of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.
    In order to further improve steelmaking production and fully utilize the power of new equipment with high production capacity, it is necessary to improve technical knowledge. I have set myself such a task: to complete my studies at a secondary night school without leaving production, and then continue my education at a specialized school or college.
    Dear friends, finally, please allow me to sincerely wish you new achievements in your work for the happiness of your beautiful motherland. We will fight together for peace and the happiness of all mankind!

　　祝你们获得新的劳动成绩
　　苏联楚索沃伊冶金工厂炼钢工人  俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃代表  尤·蒂姆金
    亲爱的中国工人朋友们！我有机会到你们伟大的国家来，并且作为来宾出席中国全国先进生产者代表会议，感到无限的荣幸。
    我们，苏联的工人们，以极大的兴趣注视着你们的英勇劳动和你们在建设新生活中所获得的每一个成就，并把这些成就当作自己的成就。你们努力用自己的劳动来加强自己国家的威力，并把你们宝贵的贡献投入争取社会主义的斗争中，这种崇高的愿望，对于我们说来是亲切而可以理解的。
    亲爱的朋友们！我是我国千百万工人队伍的一个代表。我在1942年毕业于职业学校，就在那个时候进入楚索沃伊冶金工厂。开始时是炼钢工人的三级助手，后来是二级助手，过了一些时候是一级助手。在当助手的时候，我密切注视着炼钢工人的工作，仔细地熟悉炼钢的技术操作过程。在四年中，我基本上通晓了炼钢生产的技术程序。1946年我得到允许独自进行熔炼。
    过了几年。我们工厂装置了新的设备，改善了炼钢方法。我越发感觉到知识缺乏，应当学习，应当提高熟练程度。
    1954年我从斯维尔德洛夫斯克技术学院附设的工长训练班毕业。在训练班里得到的知识帮助我进一步工作。去年第二季度我的工作组在黑色冶金部企业的全苏社会主义竞赛中占第一位。
    1955年在我的生活中发生了一件愉快的事情。楚索沃伊市的劳动人民给我以崇高的信任，选我为俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃代表。劳动人民的这种信任使我承担许多任务，首先是很好地劳动，完成和超额完成生产任务。
    我在自己的工作中极力利用一切新的、进步的方法，以加快金属的冶炼，提高质量。例如，采用新塔吉尔斯科耶炼钢工人包洛托夫的先进经验，使我们有可能加快补炉的速度。在这道生产工序上节省时间就能缩短每一炉的熔炼时间。由于采用了更进步的劳动方法，我们的工作组提前一个月完成了1955年的计划，并且超任务生产了一千六百吨钢。
    我们顺利地开始了1956年——第六个五年计划的第一年。我们的工作组在三月九日完成了今年第一季度的计划。
    今年二月召开的苏联共产党第二十次代表大会，制定了进一步大大发展我国经济的纲领。在实现这个纲领方面，炼钢工人也应当作出重大的贡献。
    第六个五年计划规定进一步提高劳动生产率。我和我的助手保证要缩短每一炉钢所耗费的时间，从而提前完成五年计划的任务。
    为了进一步改进炼钢生产，充分发挥具有高度生产能力的新设备的威力，就要提高技术知识。我给自己规定了这样一个任务：不脱离生产来完成中等夜校的学习，随后继续在专科学校或学院受教育。
    亲爱的朋友们，最后请允许我衷心地祝你们在为你们美丽的祖国谋幸福的劳动中获得新的成绩。我们将一起来为和平和全人类幸福而战斗！
