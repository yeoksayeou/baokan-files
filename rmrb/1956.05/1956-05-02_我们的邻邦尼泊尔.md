　　Our Neighbor Nepal

　　Today, Nepal holds the King's coronation ceremony. King Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah Deva of Nepal has announced his official enthronement. Our government has dispatched Vice Premier of the State Council Ulanhu as a special envoy to lead a delegation to attend the ceremony and express congratulations.
　　Nepal is one of the ancient kingdoms of Asia, located between China and India. The perpetually snow-capped Himalayas stand to the north of Nepal. The country's terrain is high and steep, with land above 900 meters above sea level accounting for half of the total area. It is surrounded by mountains on the east, west, and north sides, with only the southern part bordering India being a plain. Its capital, Kathmandu, is located in a picturesque central valley with a population of approximately 175,000.
　　Nepal has an area of 145,000 square kilometers, equivalent to the total territory of the four European countries of the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, and Switzerland. According to the results of the first preliminary census announced on April 15, 1955, its population totals 8,431,537, including the Newar, Magar, Gurung, Sunwar, Murmi, Kirati, and Gurkha ethnic groups. Except for the Gurkhas, who are of Aryan descent and migrated from India, the rest belong to the Mongoloid race.
　　The Newars are the earliest indigenous inhabitants of Nepal. They settled in the Kathmandu Valley area as early as the sixth century BC, and established the Malla dynasty from the ninth century, which was replaced by the Gurkhas in 1768.
　　As early as the end of the eighteenth century, British colonialists, who had already invaded India, began to take an interest in this ancient country in the mountains. In 1791, Britain and Nepal signed a trade treaty and took the opportunity to interfere in the disputes between China's Qing government and Nepal. In 1801, Britain signed another treaty with Nepal, using it to send a Governor's representative to reside in the Nepalese court. In 1814, Britain, under the pretext of border disputes between Nepal and India, declared war on Nepal. After Nepal was defeated, it was forced to sign the Segouli Treaty in 1816, ceding land and granting Britain various privileges, thus becoming a British protectorate. It was not until after World War I that Britain and Nepal signed the "Treaty of Perpetual Peace and Friendship" in 1923, recognizing Nepal's independence.
　　Under the oppression and interference of foreign colonialist forces, Nepal's political and economic life could not develop normally for a long time. From 1846, the country was under the rule of the Rana family. It was not until February 1951, when former King Bikram announced that Nepal was a constitutional monarchy, that the 105-year-long Rana dictatorship came to an end. In July 1952, Nepal established an advisory assembly with sixty-one members.
　　In March 1955, King Bikram passed away and was succeeded by Crown Prince Mahendra. The King announced that the election of Nepal's first constituent assembly would be held in October 1957. On January 27, 1956, a new cabinet headed by Tanka Prasad Acharya, leader of the People's Party, was formed. After taking office, the new Prime Minister said at a press conference that he would establish a new order of equality and social justice.
　　Economically, Nepal is an agricultural country, with nine-tenths of the cultivated land owned by landlords who account for only 1% of the population. Although the country has abundant natural resources, such as coal, iron, copper, zinc, gold, silver, tungsten, oil, mica, and the atomic energy raw material thorium, none of them have been mined. Industry consists of only a few light industries and raw material processing industries, such as textile, jute, oil extraction, and rice milling factories. Nepal's raw material exports are monopolized by foreign capitalists, who artificially depress prices, which has an adverse effect on Nepal's foreign trade. The new Prime Minister of Nepal pointed out at a rally: "The economic situation of this country is far from satisfactory... The most pressing issues are: improving the living conditions of the people and providing access to education, medical care, and transportation."
　　In response to these situations, King Mahendra announced the implementation of land reform last September, stipulating that land should not be left uncultivated for more than three years, and that landlords should not collect more than 50% of the total harvest from tenants. In October of the same year, the King announced a five-year plan for economic development. In this plan, the country's economic development has a priority status. The plan includes allocating 210 million rupees to develop industry, create employment opportunities, implement social welfare programs in public health and education, and is scheduled to begin implementation after the rainy season this year.
　　In international relations, the Nepalese government adopts a policy of opposing colonialism, advocating peaceful neutrality, and promoting friendly cooperation between countries. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence put forward after the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese Prime Ministers' meetings in 1954 were warmly welcomed by Nepalese government leaders and people from all walks of life. At the Asian-African Conference in April 1955, the Nepalese delegation repeatedly expressed its support for the Five Principles as the true foundation for expanding cooperation between Asian and African countries. In December of the same year, Nepal, along with fifteen other countries, was admitted as a member of the United Nations. On January 29 this year, Nepalese Prime Minister Acharya announced his government's foreign policy program, saying that Nepal would maintain peaceful relations with all countries, support the end of colonialism around the world, especially in Asia, accept any foreign aid without conditions, and promote friendly relations with all democratic countries. He referred to India and China as "two great neighbors" and expressed his willingness to consider establishing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and accepting Soviet aid.
　　Nepal and its neighbors India and China have long maintained good relations. In June 1951, Indian Prime Minister Nehru visited Nepal. King Mahendra and Queen of Nepal were also invited to visit India for more than a month last November. India has provided Nepal with a total of 85 million rupees in economic assistance, mainly for the development of highways and hydropower projects.
　　The relationship between China and Nepal can be traced back 1,500 years. Because Nepal is the holy land where the founder of Buddhism, Sakyamuni, was born and passed away, ancient Chinese eminent monks regarded pilgrimage as a glorious mission. The eminent monk Faxian of the Eastern Jin Dynasty went to Nepal in 406 AD and was the first foreign guest to visit Nepal with authentic records. Not long after Faxian's visit to Nepal, another Buddhist, Zhimeng, also went to Nepal to pay homage to the Buddhist sites. The eminent monk Xuanzang of the Tang Dynasty visited Nepal in 635 AD and reached the present capital Kathmandu. Both Faxian and Xuanzang praised Nepal's art and architecture in their records. Since then, envoys from China and Nepal have traveled back and forth, and the records are endless.
　　On August 1, 1955, the People's Republic of China and Nepal established normal diplomatic relations, marking the beginning of a new era in Sino-Nepalese relations. Since then, the friendly cooperation between the two countries has been further developed.
　　King Mahendra of Nepal said well in Delhi on November 7 last year: "Our relationship with China is built on the basis of friendship and is guided by the great Five Principles." It is precisely because of this that the development of friendly relations between China and Nepal has broad prospects.

　　我们的邻邦尼泊尔
　　皇甫炎
    今天，尼泊尔举行国王加冕典礼。尼泊尔国王马亨德拉·比尔·比克拉姆·沙阿·德瓦宣布正式登极。我国政府已经派遣国务院副总理乌兰夫为特使，率代表团前往参加典礼，并表示庆贺。
    尼泊尔是亚洲的古老王国之一，位于中国和印度之间。终年白雪皑皑的喜马拉雅山矗立在尼泊尔之北，全国地势高峻，拔海九百公尺以上的土地占总面积的一半，东、西、北三面均被山脉围绕，仅南部与印度交界处是平原。它的首都加德满都位于一个景色如画的中央河谷，有居民约十七万五千人。
    尼泊尔的面积有十四万五千平方公里，相当于欧洲的荷兰、比利时、丹麦和瑞士四国领土的总和。据1955年4月15日公布的第一次初步普查的结果，它的人口共有8，431，537人，包括尼瓦尔、马嘉、高隆、松瓦尔、木尔米、克拉底和廓尔喀等族，其中除廓尔喀人是从印度移入的雅利安种外，其余都属蒙古利亚种。
    尼瓦尔人是尼泊尔最早的土著居民，他们在公元前六世纪已定居于加德满都河谷一带，并从九世纪起建立了马拉王朝，这个王朝到1768年被廓尔喀人所取代。
    早在十八世纪末期，当时已经侵占印度的英国殖民主义者就开始对这个万山丛中的古国发生兴趣了。1791年，英国和尼泊尔签订了一项通商条约，并乘机干涉中国的清政府与尼泊尔之间的纠纷。1801年，英国又和尼泊尔签订一项条约，借此派遣一名总督代表驻在尼泊尔朝廷。1814年，英国借口尼泊尔和印度的边境纠纷，竟对尼泊尔宣战，尼泊尔战败后被迫于1816年签订塞哥里条约，除割地外还予英国以种种特权，从而沦为英国的保护国。直到第一次世界大战以后，英国和尼泊尔在1923年签订“永久和平与友好条约”，才承认尼泊尔的独立。
    在外国殖民主义势力的压迫和干涉下，尼泊尔的政治和经济生活长期不能得到正常的发展。从1846年起，这个国家处在拉纳家族的统治之下。直到1951年2月，前国王比克拉姆宣布尼泊尔为君主立宪制，才结束了一百零五年之久的拉纳专政。1952年7月尼泊尔设立了咨询议会，有议员六十一人。
    1955年3月，国王比克拉姆逝世，由太子马亨德拉继承王位。国王宣布将在1957年10月举行尼泊尔历史上第一次的制宪议会的选举。1956年1月27日，以人民党领袖坦卡·普拉沙德·阿查里雅为首的新内阁组成，新首相就职后在一次记者招待会上说，他将建立平等的和具有社会正义的新秩序。
    在经济上，尼泊尔是一个农业国家，耕地十分之九为仅占人口1％的地主所有。虽然国内有丰富的天然资源，如煤、铁、铜、锌、金、银、钨、石油、云母以及原子能的原料钍等，但都没有开采。工业只有少数的轻工业和原料加工工业，如纺织、黄麻、榨油、碾米等工厂。尼泊尔的输出原料被外国资本家所垄断，他们人为地压低价格，对尼泊尔的对外贸易产生不利的影响。尼泊尔新首相在一次集会上指出说：“这个国家的经济情况是远不能使人满意的。……最迫切的问题是：改善人民的生活条件和提供教育、医疗和交通的便利。”
    针对着这些情况，马亨德拉国王在去年九月宣布实行土地改革，规定不准土地荒废三年以上，也不许地主从佃户那里征收全部收成的50％以上。同年十月，国王又宣布了一个发展经济的五年计划，在这个计划中，国家的经济发展占着优先的地位。计划的内容是拨款二亿一千万卢比来发展工业，创造就业机会，实施公共卫生和教育方面的社会福利事业，并预定在今年雨季以后开始执行。
    尼泊尔政府在国际关系中采取反对殖民主义、主张和平中立、促进各国之间友好合作的政策。1954年中印、中缅总理会谈后提出的和平共处五项原则，受到了尼泊尔政府领袖和各阶层人民的热烈欢迎；在1955年4月的亚非会议上，尼泊尔代表团一再表示支持五项原则作为扩大亚非国家间合作的真正基础。同年十二月，尼泊尔和其他十五个国家一起被接纳为联合国会员国。今年一月二十九日，尼泊尔首相阿查里雅宣布他的政府的外交政策纲领时说，尼泊尔将同一切国家保持和平关系，支持结束世界各地的、特别是亚洲的殖民主义，接受任何外国的没有附带条件的援助，以及促进和一切民主国家的友好关系。他把印度和中国称为“两个伟大的邻邦”，并表示准备考虑同苏联建立外交关系和接受苏联的援助。
    尼泊尔和它的邻国印度、中国长期保持着良好的关系。1951年6月，印度总理尼赫鲁访问了尼泊尔。尼泊尔国王马亨德拉和王后在去年十一月也应邀到印度作了为期一个多月的访问。印度给尼泊尔的经济援助共达八千五百万卢比，主要是供发展公路和水力发电计划之用。
    中国和尼泊尔的关系可以上溯到一千五百年以前。由于尼泊尔是佛教创始人释迦牟尼诞生和圆寂的圣地，我国古代高僧莫不以朝圣为光荣的使命。东晋高僧法显于406年到尼泊尔，是有真实纪录的第一个访问尼泊尔的外宾。在法显访尼泊尔后不久，另一个佛教徒智猛也到尼泊尔朝礼佛迹。唐代高僧玄奘在635年访问了尼泊尔，并到达现在的首都加德满都。法显和玄奘在记载中都曾称道尼泊尔的艺术和建筑。从那时以后，中尼两国使节往来，史不绝书。
    1955年8月1日，中华人民共和国和尼泊尔建立正常外交关系，标志着中尼两国关系的新时期的开始。从那时以来，两国的友好合作有了进一步的发展。
    尼泊尔国王马亨德拉去年十一月七日在德里说得好：“我们和中国的关系是建筑在友好的基础上的，并且是以伟大的五项原则为指针的。”正是因为这样，中国和尼泊尔的友好关系的发展是有广阔前途的。
