Observer's Commentary

　　A Frank Confession

　　"There is an armistice in Korea, but no peace"; "In Taiwan... there are military clashes almost every day"; "There is an armistice in Vietnam, but no peace." These are the opening words of Dulles' statement to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on April 30th. At first glance, it seems that Dulles is concerned about peace. But not at all. Dulles is not at all concerned about peace. He is concerned about how the United States can control or occupy these regions and other countries, such as the Philippines, Thailand and Japan that he mentioned, and maintain them as America's "forward positions." Dulles immediately added: "From the American point of view, each of these positions is extremely important. If any one of them is lost, it would mean a dangerous breakthrough in the Western Pacific region."

　　People are very familiar with Dulles' tone of stirring up tensions. More than a year ago, Dulles issued the war cry of "three lines of defense" in order to create a tense atmosphere so that there would be an excuse to put "teeth" into the Manila Treaty. Not long ago, he advocated a "brink of war" policy in an attempt to intimidate the Chinese people and poison the international situation. Now, Dulles is ranting about the Korean issue, the Taiwan issue, and the Indochina issue; this time it is to promote America's "Mutual Security Program" ("aid" program), demanding that American taxpayers continue to tighten their belts, replace butter with cannons, and support the U.S. government's "strength" policy.

　　Dulles's speech to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on April 30 regarding the so-called "Mutual Security Program" was in fact another large-scale promotion of the United States' determination to continue its arms expansion and war preparations, and its determination to continue military threats. He proclaimed that the United States' annual military expenditure exceeds 40 billion U.S. dollars, of which 90% is used to strengthen the U.S. military machine; the other 10% is the "4 billion U.S. dollars" "aid" program that he called the "Mutual Security Program". Dulles explained the nature of this "aid" program: in the current year, 83% of the United States' foreign "aid" expenditure is used for military "aid," and only 17% is used for economic "aid." And this economic "aid" is still "directly related to the security" of the United States. Dulles declared without concealment that if some countries participating in the military groups supported by the United States are not given economic "aid," they will "not be able to maintain" their current armies. In this way, Dulles confessed the purpose of the United States' foreign "aid."

　　What is the purpose? It is that the United States provides ammunition, and the "aided" countries provide manpower, materials, and financial resources, and act under the control of the United States. Dulles said it very clearly: through this "aid," the United States can require "all parts of the earth" to provide bases, "from which Russia may be subjected to devastating attacks." Here Dulles did not say what China would be subjected to, but it is self-evident. He reiterated his three unforgettable lines of defense in the opening remarks: Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam. It can be seen that he has not forgotten his bad intentions towards China, and he attaches great importance to them.

　　When Dulles puts on this murderous face, he seems to have completely forgotten the so-called "new look" of American policy that he put on not long ago. At that time, Dulles saw that the international situation was trending towards relaxation, the idea of peaceful coexistence was deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union was carrying out a new type of equal and mutually beneficial assistance in the international arena. At that time, he saw that the U.S. foreign policy was criticized in Western Europe by the allied countries of the North Atlantic Group, in Asia by peaceful and neutral countries, as well as by Japan, the Philippines, and other countries, and in the United States by the American people and even some sober-minded people within the ruling group. For example, Democratic Party leader Stevenson delivered a speech on April 21, accusing the Republican government of "clinging to the military aspects it emphasizes in alliance treaties, foreign aid, trade and various international exchanges." This constituted a strong pressure from both inside and outside. Therefore, Dulles had to admit that "our work is more difficult." Therefore, he and some important people in the United States had to declare that the military blocs pieced together by the United States would henceforth focus on "non-military" activities; they promoted that the United States' foreign "aid" had focused more on "economic aspects." However, Dulles's statement on April 30th frankly and completely exposed the bottom line of this so-called new look. The United States' "strength" policy has not changed, and the military nature of U.S. foreign "aid" remains the same. This "aid" serves the United States' aggressive policy. With the help of this "aid," the United States will continue to incite arms expansion and war preparations in Asia and Europe; with the help of this "aid," the United States will continue to maintain military bases on the territories of other countries aimed at the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries; with the help of this "aid," the United States will continue to promote its practice of piecing together military blocs to threaten countries advocating peace and neutrality, and create international tensions. In the final analysis, Dulles has not at all intended to abandon the policy of relying on military force to create a so-called "position of strength," even though this policy has gone bankrupt and has been opposed by the people of all countries and many countries.

　　Dulles recently sometimes pretends to love peace and sometimes shows a ferocious face, full of murderous intent. This precisely reflects the unsolvable contradictions he has encountered. The various pressures that forced him to put on a "new look" are continuing to grow; as the general trend dictates, they must promote further relaxation of the situation and completely defeat his "strength position" policy. Now Dulles is determined to resist this general trend. He deliberately makes alarmist statements and creates a tense atmosphere, wanting to force American taxpayers to take out money as capital for him to continue resisting the general trend of the world and intensifying the tense situation. This is why Dulles is desperately promoting that U.S. "aid" has focused on the "economic aspect," while at the same time desperately advocating that this "aid" should be used to establish "retaliatory capabilities" and "huge deterrent forces." However, Dulles may do this today and that tomorrow, but the general trend of the world will never listen to Dulles; it must take its own path of easing the situation. Dulles's stubbornness determines his failure. All his efforts to embellish American foreign policy cannot but be in vain.

### 坦率的供认

　　坦率的供认
    “在朝鲜有停战，但是没有和平”；“在台湾……几乎每天都有军事冲突”；“在越南有停战，但是没有和平”。这是四月三十日杜勒斯在美国参议院外交委员会所作的声明中开宗明义的话。乍听起来，好像杜勒斯很关心和平。其实一点也不。杜勒斯一点也不关心和平。他关心的是美国怎样能够控制或侵占这些地区以及其他国家，例如他所提到的菲律宾，泰国和日本等，保持它们作为美国的“前沿阵地”。杜勒斯紧接着说：“从美国的观点看，这些阵地每一个都是极其重要的。如果其中有任何一个失掉，就会意味着在西太平洋地区发生危险的突破。”
    人们对于杜勒斯这种煽动紧张空气的腔调十分熟悉。一年多以前，杜勒斯发表过“三条战线”的战争叫嚣，为的是制造紧张气氛，以便有所借口好给马尼拉条约装上“牙齿”。而在不久前，他又鼓吹过“战争边缘”政策，企图恫吓中国人民，并且毒化国际局势。现在，杜勒斯又在朝鲜问题、台湾问题和印度支那问题上大发狂言了；这一次是为美国的“共同安全计划”（“援”外计划）作鼓吹，要求美国的纳税人继续勒紧裤带，用大炮代替黄油，支持美国政府的“实力”政策。
    杜勒斯四月三十日在美国参议院外交委员会关于所谓“共同安全计划”的发言，实际上是再一次大张旗鼓宣扬美国一定要继续推行扩军备战，一定要继续实行军事威胁。他宣扬美国每年的军事开支，超过四百亿美元，其中90％用于加强美国的军事机器；另外10％是他所说的“四十亿美元”的“援”外计划，即所谓“共同安全计划”。杜勒斯说明了这种“援”外计划的性质：美国在本年度中，对外“援助”的开支83％用于军事“援助”，只有17％用于经济“援助”。而这种经济“援助”，仍然同美国的“安全直接有关”。杜勒斯毫不掩饰地宣称，如果对参加了美国所支持的军事集团的一些国家不给以经济上的“援助”，它们就“维持不了”目前的军队。这样，杜勒斯就供认了美国的对外“援助”的目的。
    什么目的呢？就是美国出军火，受“援”国家出人力、物力、财力，受美国的支配行事。杜勒斯说得很清楚：通过这种“援助”，美国可以要“地球的各处”提供基地，“从这些基地，俄国可能受到毁灭性的攻击”。在这里杜勒斯没有说中国会受到什么，但是，这是不言而喻的。他开宗明义就重复了他念念不忘的三条战线：朝鲜、台湾、越南。可见他对中国的坏念头不但没有忘掉，而且是非常着重的。
    杜勒斯摆出这种杀气腾腾的面孔时，好像完全忘记了他不久以前装出的所谓美国政策的“新面貌”。那时候，杜勒斯看到国际局势趋向缓和，和平共处的思想深入人心，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营在国际上进行了新型的平等互利的援助。那时候，他看到美国的外交政策在西欧遭到北大西洋集团同盟国的批评，在亚洲遭到和平中立国家以及日本、菲律宾等国的批评，在美国遭到美国人民、甚至统治集团内部一些头脑清醒的人士的反对。例如，美国民主党的领袖史蒂文森在四月二十一日发表演说，指责共和党政府“死抱住它在同盟条约、援外、贸易和各种国际交流中所强调的军事方面”。这就构成了里里外外的强大压力。因此，杜勒斯不得不承认“我们的工作是更加困难了”。因此，他和美国的一些重要人士不得不宣称，美国拼凑的军事集团今后将着重于“非军事性质”的活动；他们宣传美国的对外“援助”已更多地着重于“经济方面”。但是，现在杜勒斯四月三十日的声明却坦率地把这种所谓新面貌的底子一下子给完全戳穿了。美国的“实力”政策并没有改变，美国对外“援助”的军事性质也依然如故。这种“援助”是为美国的侵略政策服务的。借助于这种“援助”，美国将在亚洲和欧洲继续鼓动扩军备战；借助于这种“援助”，美国将继续在别国领土上保持针对苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的军事基地；借助于这种“援助”，美国将继续推行它拼凑军事集团的作法来威胁主张和平中立的国家，并且制造国际紧张局势。归根到底，杜勒斯丝毫没有打算放弃倚靠军事来造成所谓“实力地位”政策，尽管这种政策已经破产，遭到了各国人民和许多国家的反对。
    杜勒斯最近一会儿装成热爱和平，一会儿又满脸横肉，杀气腾腾。这正是反映了他所碰到的难以解决的矛盾。迫使他装出“新面貌”的种种压力正在继续增长；大势所趋，它们一定要推动局势进一步和缓，使他的“实力地位”政策完全失败。现在杜勒斯定要抗拒这种大势。他有意危言耸听，制造紧张气氛，想迫使美国纳税人拿出钱来，作为他继续抗拒世界大势、加剧紧张局势的资本。这就是为什么杜勒斯一方面拼命宣传美“援”已侧重“经济方面”，同时又拼命鼓吹要通过这种“援助”来建立“报复能力”和“巨大的威慑力量”的原因。但是，杜勒斯不妨今天这样、明天那样，而世界大势却决不会听杜勒斯的话，它一定要走它自己的和缓局势的道路。杜勒斯的顽固，决定了他的失败。他想粉饰美国对外政策的一切努力，不能不都付诸东流。
