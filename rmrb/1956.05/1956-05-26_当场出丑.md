    Embarrassed on the Spot
    On May 11th, United Press International (UPI) sent a dispatch from Macau, reporting that it had received information that Fu Yin-zhao, the eldest son of the famous Macau businessman Fu Tak-yeung, had been detained in Beijing. The reason given was that the Chinese government was forcing him to buy government bonds worth three million patacas.
    This "exclusive news" from UPI caused a sensation in Hong Kong and Macau. Because recently, no fewer than hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong and Macau compatriots have returned to the mainland for visits, and no one has ever been detained. This news from UPI was truly "news" for the compatriots in Hong Kong and Macau. After inquiries by other foreign news agencies and Hong Kong and Macau newspaper reporters, the facts were completely different from UPI's report. It turned out that on the very day UPI issued this news, Fu Yin-zhao had just returned to Macau after visiting the motherland. The Hong Kong and Macau press confirmed that before noon on May 12th, Fu Yin-zhao had been chatting happily at the home of Ho Yin, a leading figure in the Macau business community. UPI's outrageous lie was thus exposed.
    However, UPI was still unwilling to admit defeat and issued another "reliable news" report on the 12th, insisting that Fu Yin-zhao's appearance in Macau was "not real."
    However, on the 13th, Fu Yin-zhao arrived in Hong Kong by boat from Macau. UPI, the spreader of "reliable news," was embarrassed on the spot.
    The rumor-mongering experts at UPI, following the instructions of their masters, wanted to use the lie of Fu Yin-zhao's detention to intimidate the compatriots in Hong Kong and Macau, preventing them from coming to the mainland to understand the truth about the motherland. But this time they miscalculated again and ended up in a stinking mess.

### 当场出丑

    当场出丑
    五月十一日，美国合众社从澳门发出一条消息说，它获得报告，澳门著名商人傅德荫之长子傅荫钊已经在北京被扣留。原因据说是中国政府要强迫他购买价值三百万葡币的公债。
    合众社的这一条“独家新闻”轰动了香港、澳门两地。因为最近港澳同胞回国参观的人不下数十万人，从来没有一个人被扣留过。合众社的这条消息对港澳同胞来说，倒真是一个“新闻”。经过其它的外国通讯社和港澳报纸的记者的访问，事实却和合众社的报道完全不同。原来就在合众社发出这条新闻的这一天，傅荫钊刚好在访问祖国大陆以后回到了澳门。港澳报界证实：在五月十二日中午以前，傅荫钊一直在澳门的商界领袖何贤的家中畅谈。合众社的弥天大谎就这样被戳穿了。
    可是，合众社却还不服输，在十二日又发出了一条“可靠消息”，硬说傅荫钊在澳门出现“事非真实”。
    然而，十三日傅荫钊却从澳门坐船来到了香港。散布“可靠消息”，的合众社当场出了丑。
    合众社的造谣专家们，按照他们主子的指示，想用傅荫钊被扣留的谎言恐吓港澳同胞，使他们不敢到祖国大陆上来了解祖国的真相。但是这一回又失了风，落得个臭气熏天。
