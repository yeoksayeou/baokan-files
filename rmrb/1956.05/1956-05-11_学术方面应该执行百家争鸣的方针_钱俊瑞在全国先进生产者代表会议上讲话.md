Qian Junrui, Deputy Director of the Second Office of the State Council, said at the National Conference of Advanced Producers' Representatives on the 9th: In order to quickly master advanced science and improve our scientific and technological level, we should implement the policy of free discussion and letting a hundred schools of thought contend on academic issues.

Qian Junrui said that in academic and technical issues, we should not be afraid and should encourage the formation of schools of thought with original insights. Different opinions on the same academic issue should be allowed, and realistic and free debates should be carried out between these different opinions, so as to seek the continuous development and progress of academics through mutual debate.

Qian Junrui's speech was titled "Actively and Steadily Building Socialist Culture." After describing the main achievements on the cultural front in the six years since the founding of the country, he said that although our cultural and educational undertakings have greatly developed in recent years, our undertakings are far behind the needs of national construction and the people. We are still a culturally backward country in the true sense of the word. Since our science and technology are in a seriously backward state, we must intensify our learning and strive to catch up. We must learn the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, and also learn the advanced science and technology of capitalist countries, especially the United States, Britain, and France. We must earnestly learn all scientific and technological knowledge that is applicable to our socialist construction, regardless of which country it comes from. Of course, the Soviet Union is our elder brother, and we should learn from the Soviet Union first, which should be affirmed without any doubt.

Qian Junrui then talked about how to cultivate more and better talents for national construction. He said that the rapid development of our socialist construction urgently requires us to cultivate a large number of qualified construction talents in all aspects. In this regard, our universities and secondary vocational schools should give full play to their initiative and potential. However, the training of construction talents cannot rely solely on regular schools, and we must also earnestly grasp the very important link of spare-time education. Based on our existing experience and the experience of socialist countries, it should be affirmed that the development of spare-time education is an important way to improve the cultural and technical level of workers and cultivate talents for national construction. Therefore, it is suggested that all business departments, according to their own needs for training and improving cadres, make full use of all their possible conditions and closely cooperate with the education departments to run various types of spare-time schools at all levels.

He pointed out that all types of schools at all levels should first pay attention to ensuring that our education fully meets the needs of national construction. The professional settings and curriculum content of the schools must be combined with the current and long-term needs of our country. Secondly, in order to make every student trained by the school a qualified construction talent, attention must be paid to the all-round development of students, so that students have not only rich cultural and scientific knowledge, but also communist morality, character and a healthy body. In terms of improving students' cultural and scientific knowledge, what we need to pay special attention to at present is to strengthen the learning of systematic basic scientific knowledge and the combination of theory and practice.

Qian Junrui said that the key to improving the quality of school education lies in the improvement of teachers. We suggest that teachers of all types of schools at all levels across the country, under the leadership of outstanding teachers, should study Marxist-Leninist theory more systematically and in close connection with reality, transform and improve their thinking, and improve their work. This is the key to the key to improving schools. At the same time, teachers should seize the time to carry out their own professional study, and teachers in colleges and universities should vigorously carry out scientific research work. Our educational administrative departments and other relevant departments should give necessary support and assistance in this regard.

Qian Junrui then talked about the relevant issues of further carrying out mass cultural, educational and health work. He said that with the victorious advance of our socialist transformation and socialist construction, the people's need to improve their cultural living standards is becoming more and more urgent. We must actively carry out mass cultural and educational work in coordination with the development of production and construction, and make the greatest efforts to meet the cultural needs of the broad masses.

He said that improving the cultural level of the masses should first emphasize the movement to eliminate illiteracy. Only after the people have mastered the tool of writing can they master cultural knowledge and scientific and technological knowledge, and then they can further develop their talents and wisdom and promote and carry out socialist construction. We suggest that all literate people, especially young advanced producers and advanced workers, actively promote and participate in this movement of great historical significance, so that the work of eliminating illiteracy can be widely and soundly carried out.

He said that in the future, in further carrying out mass cultural, educational, and health work, the following three issues must be emphasized: (1) Our cultural, educational, and health work is to serve socialist economic construction and the broad masses. Therefore, we must fully rely on the strength of the masses to actively develop grass-roots cultural and educational work and overcome right-leaning conservative ideas in our work; but at the same time, we must also pay attention to the fact that the improvement of the people's cultural living standards must be adapted to the level of production development and the level of the people's economic life. Therefore, various cultural, educational, and health undertakings in rural areas can only be gradually carried out with the development of production. Some of the things that can be done now, such as temporary nurseries, clubs, and night schools, should also be as economical and simple as possible. No money should be spent if possible, and as little money as possible should be spent. Absolutely no large amounts of manpower, materials, and financial resources should be spent on cultural and welfare undertakings shortly after the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives. Any of our work must cherish the people's resources and ensure that the income of workers and peasants increases year by year; only on the basis of production development and increased mass income, and in accordance with the real needs of the masses, can we appropriately carry out various mass cultural and educational undertakings, so that our work can truly gain the support of the masses and attract the broad masses to participate consciously and voluntarily. (2) In carrying out mass cultural and educational work, we should pay special attention to carrying forward our rich and excellent national cultural heritage. In literary and artistic work, we must ensure that all national and folk art forms that are popular with the masses can be developed, and resolutely implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and bringing forth the new from the old." In health work, we should continue to deeply criticize the erroneous ideas of belittling and discriminating against traditional Chinese medicine, and take all necessary measures to strengthen the work of traditional Chinese medicine, properly arrange the business of traditional Chinese medicine, and solve the problem of Western medicine learning traditional Chinese medicine. At the same time, we must also improve traditional Chinese medicine, so that traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine can unite, cooperate, learn from each other, and improve together, in order to strive to complete the task of sorting out the medical heritage and establishing a unified new medicine. (3) We must give extra attention to the development of cultural and educational work in minority areas. In recent years, the various cultural, educational, and health undertakings in minority areas of our country have developed significantly due to the implementation of the correct ethnic policies and work guidelines of the Central Government. This situation has gradually changed the poverty and backwardness left over from the history of minority areas in our country, and laid a preliminary foundation for the unity of all ethnic groups and further economic and cultural development. In the future, we must continue to attach importance to developing school education in minority areas, strengthening medical institutions, carrying forward the excellent artistic traditions of various ethnic groups, helping ethnic groups without writing systems to create writing systems as soon as possible, and strengthening scientific research work in minority areas, so that all fraternal ethnic groups can play a greater role in our country's socialist construction, and at the same time gradually eliminate the situation of actual inequality in culture among all ethnic groups in our country.

### 学术方面应该执行百家争鸣的方针  钱俊瑞在全国先进生产者代表会议上讲话

    学术方面应该执行百家争鸣的方针
    钱俊瑞在全国先进生产者代表会议上讲话
    国务院第二办公室副主任钱俊瑞，九日在全国先进生产者代表会议上讲话说：为了迅速地掌握先进的科学，提高我们的科学技术水平，我们在学术问题上应该贯彻自由讨论、百家争鸣的方针。
    钱俊瑞说，在学术性和技术性的问题上，我们不要害怕而且应该鼓励形成有独创见解的学派。应该容许对同一学术问题抱有各种不同的见解，并且要开展这些不同见解之间的实事求是的自由的争论，以便在相互争辩中求得学术的不断发展和前进。
    钱俊瑞的讲话是以“积极和稳步地建设社会主义的文化”为题的。他在叙述了建国六年来文化战线上的主要成就以后说，我国文教事业这几年来虽然有了很大的发展，但是我们的事业远远赶不上国家建设和人民群众的需要。我们还是一个名符其实的文化落后的国家。我国的科学技术既然处于严重落后的状态，我们就必须加紧学习，努力赶上。我们既要学习苏联和人民民主国家的先进科学技术，也要学习资本主义国家的，首先是美国、英国、法国的先进科学技术。凡是对我国社会主义建设适用的科学技术知识，不问来自那个国家，我们都要认真学习。当然，苏联是我们的老大哥，我们应该首先向苏联学习，这是应该肯定无疑的。
    钱俊瑞接着讲述了怎样更多更好地培养国家建设人才的问题。他说，我国社会主义建设迅速发展，迫切地要求我们为各方面培养大量的合格的建设人才。在这方面，我们的高等学校和中等专业学校应该充分发挥自己的积极性和潜力。但是，培养建设人才不能单靠正规学校，我们还必须认真抓紧业余教育这一个十分重要的环节。根据我国已有的经验和社会主义阵营各国的经验，应该肯定发展业余教育是提高职工文化技术水平和培养国家建设人才的一个重要途径。因此建议各个业务部门都能根据自己培养和提高干部的需要，尽量地运用自己的一切可能条件，和教育部门密切配合起来，举办各级各类的业余学校。
    他指出，我们的各级各类学校，都应该首先注意使我们的教育必须完全适合国家建设的需要。学校的专业设置和课程内容，必须结合我们国家当前的和长远的需要。其次，要使学校培养出来的学生，每一个人都成为合格的建设人才，就必须注意学生的全面发展，要使学生既有丰富的文化科学知识，又有共产主义的道德、品质和健康的身体。在提高学生的文化科学知识方面，当前我们须要特别注意的是加强系统的基础科学知识的学习和理论和实际的结合。
    钱俊瑞说，提高学校教育质量的关键在于师资的提高。我们建议全国各级各类学校的教师们，在优秀教师的带动下，要更加有系统地而且密切联系实际地学习马克思列宁主义的理论，改造和提高自己的思想和改进自己的工作。这是改进学校的关键的关键。同时，教师们应该抓紧进行自己的业务学习，高等学校的教师们应该大力进行科学研究工作。我们的教育行政部门和其它有关部门，在这方面都应该给以必要的支持和帮助。
    钱俊瑞接着讲述了进一步开展群众性的文化、教育、卫生工作的有关问题。他说，随着我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设事业的胜利推进，人民群众对于提高文化生活水平的需要越来越迫切。我们必须配合生产建设的发展，积极地开展群众性的文教工作，以最大的努力来满足广大群众的文化需要。
    他说，提高群众的文化水平，首先应该重视的是扫除文盲运动。人民群众只有在掌握了文字这个工具以后，才有可能去掌握文化知识和科学技术知识，才能够进一步发挥自己的才能和智慧，推动和进行社会主义的建设。我们建议一切识字的人，尤其是青年先进生产者和先进工作者，要积极推动和参加这个具有重大历史意义的运动，使扫盲工作得到广泛、健全的开展。
    他说，在今后进一步开展群众性的文教卫生工作中，必须重视以下三个问题：（一）我们的文教卫生工作，是为社会主义经济建设、为广大群众服务的。因此，我们必须充分依靠群众的力量，来积极发展基层的文教工作，克服工作中的右倾保守思想；但同时我们也必须注意：人民文化生活水平的提高，一定要和生产发展的水平、人民经济生活的水平相适应。因此，农村中的各种文化、教育、卫生事业，只能随着生产的发展逐步举办，有些当前可以举办的如临时托儿站、俱乐部、夜校等，也应当力求节省和简单朴素，能不花钱的就不花钱，能少花钱的就尽量少花钱。绝对不应该在农业生产合作社成立不久，就耗费大量人力、物力和财力，来兴办文化福利事业。我们的任何工作必须十分爱惜民力，保证工人农民的收入逐年有所增加；我们只有在生产发展和群众收入增加的基础上，并且适应着群众的真实需要，适当地举办各项群众文教事业，才能使我们的工作真正得到群众的支持，吸引广大群众自觉自愿地参加。（二）在开展群众性的文教工作中，我们应该特别重视发扬我国丰富的和优秀的民族文化遗产。在文学艺术工作中，必须使一切为群众喜闻乐见的民族的和民间的文艺形式都能得到发展，坚决贯彻“百花齐放推陈出新”的方针。在卫生工作中，应该继续深入地批判轻视歧视中医的错误思想，并且切实采取各项必要的措施来加强中医的工作，妥善地安排中医的业务，解决西医学习中医的问题。同时也要提高中医，使中医和西医团结合作互相学习，共同提高，来努力完成整理医学遗产和建立统一的新医学的任务。（三）必须对发展少数民族地区的文教工作给以份外的重视。几年来，我国少数民族地区的各项文教卫生事业，由于执行了中央正确的民族政策和工作方针，发展是很显著的。这种情况，已经在逐步地改变着我国少数民族历史上遗留下来的贫困和落后的面貌，为各族人民的团结和经济文化进一步发展，打下了初步基础，今后我们还必须继续重视在少数民族地区发展学校教育，加强医疗机构，发扬各民族的优秀艺术传统，帮助没有文字的民族尽快地创造文字，加强少数民族地区的科学研究工作，使各个兄弟民族在我国社会主义的建设中发挥更大的作用，同时逐步地消灭我国各民族在文化方面实际上处于不平等的状况。（附图片）
