From last winter to this spring, a fairly widespread phenomenon of draft animals becoming thin and dying has occurred in agricultural production cooperatives in various regions, and it has not completely stopped yet. This phenomenon has already more or less affected the normal progress of spring plowing and production, and should arouse sufficient attention.

A small number of draft animals died or became thin because they were harmed by reactionary landlords, rich peasants, and other counter-revolutionaries. But most died or became thin when their masters—the farmers—were not careful. Does this mean that farmers do not cherish draft animals and do not understand their importance? Not at all. Farmers cherish draft animals very much. Farmers understand best the important role of draft animals in agricultural and sideline production. Farmers often regard a draft animal as half of their family property. Then, does this indicate that after draft animals become the collective property of the cooperative, the members no longer like draft animals? That is not the case either. Many members are also very dissatisfied and distressed to see draft animals constantly dying and becoming thin. Then, isn't this phenomenon very contradictory? This phenomenon is indeed contradictory, reflecting the contradiction between farmers' private ownership concepts and collectivist thinking. After joining agricultural production cooperatives, farmers' enthusiasm for labor has soared to unprecedented heights, and they are willing to work more and earn more work points. However, many people's collectivist thinking has not been established in a timely and solid manner, resulting in a harmful idea: "Earning more work points is for myself, but exhausting the animals is for everyone; the death of one or two animals won't be much of a burden on me personally." When members have this kind of erroneous thinking, coupled with lax systems and lack of experience, many draft animals gradually die and become thin.

From this, we can see that the decisive link in solving this problem is to strengthen collectivist ideological education for all members; as long as they regard the cooperative's public draft animals as they did their own draft animals before joining the cooperative, this problem will be basically solved. It is necessary to repeatedly explain to the members the consistency of collective interests and individual interests, and tell them through local specific facts that if every cooperative loses a few draft animals, the whole province and the whole country will lose tens of thousands of draft animals, which is such a huge loss to the country! The death of draft animals is not only unfavorable to the country but also unfavorable to every member. The death of draft animals will inevitably affect the production of the cooperative. If the cooperative's production is reduced, what is the use of individuals earning more work points? Since its establishment, the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Wuyang County, Henan Province, has lost fifty-seven draft animals, and three hundred and forty-one draft animals have become thin. The cooperative has therefore lost more than 16,000 yuan. The large-scale death of draft animals has seriously affected the production of the cooperative, and many production teams have therefore been unable to sow in a timely manner. It is not difficult for people to see, is it better to exhaust the draft animals to earn more work points and divide more things? Or is it better to cherish the draft animals and let the cooperative increase production and divide more things?

The purpose of conducting collectivist education is to make members cherish the cooperative's draft animals as they cherish their own draft animals. Every cooperative should, on the basis of collectivist education, formulate necessary measures to embody the members' enthusiasm for cherishing draft animals in a certain system, so that every person who feeds and uses draft animals assumes a certain responsibility to the cooperative. The cooperative's draft animals should have dedicated personnel for feeding and dedicated personnel for using them, and there should be a method for contact and handover between the feeder and the user. This will prevent the phenomenon of no one being responsible, poor feeding, and excessive use. Many agricultural production cooperatives in Heilongjiang Province implement a three-person responsibility system and handover system for users, herders, and feeders, strengthening the feeding and management of public livestock, and the cooperative's draft animals are raised to be strong and healthy.

Reasonable systems must be implemented by appropriate personnel. Feeding and using draft animals require certain experience and skills, which not every farmer can do. However, the personnel who feed and use draft animals in many cooperatives are still very unreliable and incompetent. Among the four feeders in the Taipingdian Village Cooperative in Anyang County, Henan Province, in addition to a demobilized soldier who lacked experience in feeding draft animals, the other three were a child, a disabled person, and a deaf person. The Yanghe Cooperative in Dali County, Yunnan Province, originally had fifty-four feeders, of which five were landlords and rich peasants, and five were very irresponsible in their work. Draft animals are the "lifeline" of the cooperative. How can the "lifeline" be handed over to such personnel? Feeders and users should be carefully selected, and those party members, league members, and activists who are actively responsible and have experience in feeding and using livestock should be appointed. Some feeders have fed draft animals in the past and also want to feed the cooperative's draft animals well, but they lack experience in large-scale feeding of draft animals. The county and district party and government leading organs and agricultural departments should be responsible for summarizing and disseminating various local advanced experiences to help feeders establish scientific methods for feeding and managing draft animals.

The labor remuneration of feeding personnel should be set reasonably, and a reward and punishment system should be established to stimulate the enthusiasm of the feeders, so that they care about the results of their labor from a material reward perspective. Many cooperatives have two biases in handling this issue. Some do not calculate remuneration according to the principle of "more work, more pay," but instead calculate "old five points" regardless of whether the draft animals are fed well or not. Some set the remuneration of feeders too low, even lower than the remuneration of an ordinary medium-level labor force. This is of course inappropriate. Feeding and managing livestock is a rather arduous task. In cooperatives where draft animals are fed centrally, the remuneration of feeders should be equivalent to that of the same labor force engaged in other agricultural labor. Reasonable remuneration should also be stipulated for households that raise livestock scattered in the homes of members, so that livestock raising households do not suffer losses.

Centralized feeding of draft animals requires certain equipment. Most of the cooperatives newly established last winter and this spring did not have time to make the necessary preparations in this regard. As a result, large, small, old, and weak draft animals of different types are crowded together, conflicting with each other, eating unevenly, and easily causing accidents of thinning and death. All cooperatives should, under the principle of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, make full use of the original livestock sheds and equipment of the members and make necessary additions to solve this problem as soon as possible. If it is really difficult to add these facilities, a decentralized feeding method can be temporarily adopted, and the draft animals can be contracted to production teams, production groups, or individual members for feeding.

Insufficient feed is also an important reason for the current poor feeding of draft animals. Some farmers let draft animals join the cooperative but leave the feed behind; if the cooperative does not have enough feed, the draft animals will of course become thin. Why are these farmers unwilling to hand over the feed to the cooperative? The most important reason is that some cooperatives set the price of feed joining the cooperative too low, and farmers are afraid of suffering losses. They burn and use the feed themselves, or sell it to other cooperatives, and are unwilling to join their own cooperative. In order to solve this problem, it is first necessary to correct the bias of underpricing feed so that members can obtain reasonable benefits from the cooperative, and they will naturally be willing to take out the stored feed. The cooperative should also prepare some coal or other fuel for the members, which can also save a lot of feed.

An ancient saying goes: "Spring cattle are like warhorses." We need to expand the replanting area and practice intensive cultivation, all of which require more and better draft animals. Horses are comrades-in-arms and the second life of soldiers, so all soldiers love horses. Draft animals are currently the only power of the cooperative, and they will still have a significant role in the future; members of the cooperative should cherish their draft animals as soldiers cherish horses, and raise them to be fat and strong.

### 把合作社的耕畜全都养好

    把合作社的耕畜全都养好
    从去年冬天到今年春天，各个地区的农业生产合作社中，相当普遍地发生了耕畜瘦弱、死亡的现象，到现在还没有完全停止。这种现象已经或多或少地影响了春耕生产的正常进行，应该引起人们足够的注意。
    死亡、瘦弱的耕畜，少数是被反动地主、富农和别的反革命分子暗害了的。但多数是在它们的主人——农民不当心的时候死亡和瘦弱了的。这是不是说农民并不爱惜耕畜和不懂得耕畜的重要呢？完全不是这样。农民是很爱惜耕畜的。农民最懂得耕畜在农业和副业生产中的重要作用。农民经常把一头耕牛看作自己的半个家产。那末，这是不是表示，耕畜变成合作社的公有财产以后，社员就不再喜欢耕畜了呢？也不是这样。许多社员看到耕畜不断死亡、瘦弱也是很不满意、很痛心的。那末，这种现象不是很矛盾的吗？这种现象确实是矛盾的，它反映了农民的私有观念和集体主义思想的矛盾。参加农业生产合作社以后，农民的劳动积极性空前高涨，他们愿意多作工，多得工分。但是，许多人的集体主义思想还没有及时地巩固地树立起来，于是产生了一种有害的想法：“多得工分是自己的，累死牲口是大家的；死一两个牲口，我一个人身上摊不了许多。”社员有了这种错误思想，加以制度不严，缺乏经验，许多耕畜就逐渐死亡、瘦弱了。
    从这里可以看到，解决这个问题的决定性环节，是对全体社员加强集体主义思想教育；他们只要把合作社的公有耕畜看得和自己入社以前的自有耕畜那样，这个问题基本上就解决了。要反复地对社员讲解集体利益和个人利益的一致性，通过当地的具体事实告诉社员，如果每一个合作社死亡几头耕畜，全省、全国就要死亡成千成万的耕畜，这对国家是多么巨大的损失！死亡耕畜对国家不利，对每个社员也很不利。死亡耕畜必然影响合作社的生产，合作社如果减产了，个人多得一些工分又有什么用处呢？河南舞阳县先锋农业合作社自从建社以来，死了五十七头耕畜，并有三百四十一头耕畜瘦弱了。合作社因此损失了一万六千多元。耕畜大量死亡，已经严重地影响了这个社的生产，许多生产队因此不能适时地播种了。人们不难看到，究竟是为了多得工分，累死耕畜能多分东西呢？还是爱护耕畜，让社里增了产能多分东西呢？
    进行集体主义教育的目的，是让社员像爱护自己的耕畜一样地爱护合作社的耕畜。每个合作社都应该在集体主义教育的基础上，定出必要的办法，让社员爱护耕畜的积极性体现在一定的制度中，使每一个饲养、使役
  耕畜的人员，都对合作社担负起一定的责任。合作社的耕畜要有专人喂
  养，专人使用，并且应该有喂养者和使役者联系、交接的办法。这样就不会发生无人负责、喂养不善和使用过度的现象了。黑龙江省许多农业生产合作社实行使役员、放牧员、饲养员的三员责任制度和交接制度，加强了对公有牲畜的饲养管理，合作社的耕畜就养得膘肥体壮。
    合理的制度要由适当的人员来执行。喂养、使用耕畜，都需要一定的经验和技术，并不是每个农民都作得了的。但是，现在不少合作社饲养、使役耕畜的人员，还很不可靠和很不称职。河南安阳县太平店村合作社的四个饲养员中，除了一个缺乏喂养耕畜经验的转业军人以外，其余三个是一个小孩、一个残废人员、一个聋子。云南大理县阳和合作社原有五十四个饲养员，其中有五个是地主、富农，有五个对工作很不负责任。耕畜是合作社的“命根子”，怎么能够把“命根子”交给这样的人员掌握呢？饲养员和使役人员要经过认真的挑选，让那些积极负责、有喂养和使役牲畜经验的党员、团员和积极分子担任。有些饲养员过去喂过耕畜，也一心想把合作社的耕畜喂好，但是缺乏大规模饲养耕畜的经验。县、区党政领导机关和农业部门要负责总结和传播当地各种先进经验，帮助饲养员建立科学的喂养、管理耕畜的方法。
    饲养人员的劳动报酬要订得合理，奖惩制度要建立起来，以刺激饲养员的积极性，使他们从物质报酬上关心自己的劳动成果。许多合作社处理这个问题，存在着两种偏向。有的没有按照“多劳多得”的原则计算报酬，而是不管耕畜喂的好坏，一律算“老五分”。有的把饲养员的报酬定得过低，甚至不如一个普通中等劳动力的报酬。这当然是不妥当的。饲养、管理牲畜是一种相当艰苦的劳动，在集中喂养耕畜的合作社中，饲养员的报酬要相当于从事其他农业劳动的同等劳动力。耕畜分散在社员家中喂养的，也要规定合理的报酬，不能使养畜户吃亏。
    耕畜集中喂养，需要一定的设备。去冬今春新建立的合作社，大部分没有来得及在这方面进行必要的准备。结果，大的、小的、老的、弱的不同类型的耕畜挤在一起，互相抵触，饮食不均，容易造成瘦弱、死亡的事故。各个合作社应该在勤俭办社的原则下，充分利用社员原有的畜舍和设备，并且加以必要的增补，尽快地解决这个问题。如果增建这些设备确有困难，还可以暂时采用分散喂养的办法，把耕畜分别包给生产队、生产组或社员个人喂养。
    饲草饲料不够，也是当前耕畜喂养不好的一个重要原因。有些农民让耕畜入社，但是留下饲草饲料；合作社的饲草饲料不够，耕畜当然要喂瘦了。为什么这些农民不愿意把草料交给合作社呢？最重要的原因，是某些合作社把入社的饲料饲草的代价定得过低，农民害怕吃亏，自己把草料烧掉用掉，或者卖给别的合作社，也不愿意入到自己的合作社里。为了解决这个问题，首先要纠正饲草饲料作价过低的偏向，使社员能够从合作社中得到合理的收益，他们自然就愿意把贮存的草料拿出来了。合作社还应该准备一些煤炭或别的燃料供给社员，这也可以节省许多饲草。
    古语说：“春牛如战马”。我们要扩大复种面积，要实行精耕细作，都需要有更多、更好的耕畜。马是战士的战友，战士的第二生命，所以战士全都爱马。耕畜目前是合作社唯一的动力，将来也还有重大的作用；合作社社员们应该像战士爱马一样，把自己的耕畜养的又肥又壮。
