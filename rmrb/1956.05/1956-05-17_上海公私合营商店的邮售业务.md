Shanghai Joint Public-Private Stores' Mail Order Business

Since becoming joint public-private enterprises, many stores in Shanghai have continued to serve consumers in various regions through mail order, receiving enthusiastic welcome from people all over the country.

The mail order business of the joint public-private Wuzhou Bicycle Shop has reached remote areas such as Yunnan and Xinjiang. The bicycle parts sold by this store are regularly sent through the post office to more than 200 handicraft production cooperatives in Xinjiang and other places. Famous joint public-private Dabu Tong, Hongxing, and Heming shoe stores often make various styles of leather shoes according to the specific designs requested in letters from customers in other places, and mail them to them. Yong'an Company has expanded its mail order business after becoming a joint public-private enterprise. Not long ago, they received a letter and ten yuan from a consumer at the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory. The letter entrusted the Yong'an Company's mail order department with the purchase of miscellaneous items such as food and toys, with an expression of trust. The staff of Yong'an Company's mail order department responsibly fulfilled this commission and received a letter of praise from the consumer.

    上海公私合营商店的邮售业务
    上海市许多商店在公私合营以后继续用邮售办法为各地消费者服务，得到各地人民的热烈欢迎。
    公私合营五洲车行的邮售业务一直达到云南、新疆等边远地区。这个商店经营的自行车零件经常通过邮局寄给新疆等地二百多家手工业生产合作社。著名的公私合营大不同、红星、鹤鸣等皮鞋商店，经常根据外地顾客来信特定的式样制作各式皮鞋，并且邮寄给他们。永安公司在公私合营以后扩大了邮售业务。不久以前，他们接到国营郑州第三棉纺织厂一个消费者的来信和人民币十元。来信以信任的口吻委托永安公司邮售部为他采购食品、玩具等零星用品。永安公司邮售部的工作人员很负责地完成了这一委托，受到消费者来信表扬。
