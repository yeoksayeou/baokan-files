Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 23rd: More than a thousand people from all ethnic groups and walks of life in Lhasa gathered today in the Lhasa Auditorium to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the signing of the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet." Chen Yi, head of the Central Delegation, Zhang Jingwu, deputy head of the delegation, and some members of the delegation also attended the meeting.

The speakers at today's meeting unanimously praised the significant achievements Tibet has made in political, economic, and cultural construction since its liberation. Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, said: The Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet is not only the foundation for creating happiness for Tibet, but the recent establishment of the unified Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is also the result of the concrete implementation of this agreement. Kalon Surkhang Wangchen Gelek, representing the Tibetan Local Government, said in his speech: The seventeen-article agreement is the basis and guide for our Tibetan monks and lay people to move towards development and progress. Every stage of work done in the past to implement the agreement has been beneficial to the broad masses of Tibetan people.

Speakers at the meeting further mentioned that in order to promote Tibet's progress and greater development, reforms must be implemented. Lhamin Yixi Chuchen, Deputy Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, said: We unanimously support Tibet taking the socialist road and demand reform, which is the correct path for the development and progress of the Tibetan people.

Zhang Guohua, Acting Secretary of the CPC Tibet Working Committee, pointed out in his speech: At present, the task before us is to carry out various reform matters suitable for the development of the Tibetan people and in line with the interests of the Tibetan people, step by step, in accordance with the spirit of the agreement and in light of the specific circumstances of Tibet, and to realize a unified autonomous region. We will gradually carry out various reform matters through full consultation and peaceful consultation from top to bottom. Zhang Guohua continued: The People's Liberation Army and staff entering Tibet adopt a positive attitude of supporting and supporting the internal reform of Tibet, but not to take over and do everything ourselves. We always adhere to the principle that the reform of Tibet's inherent systems should be carried out consciously and voluntarily by the Tibetan people and the leaders connected with the Tibetan people.

Chen Yi and Zhang Jingwu also spoke at the meeting. Chen Yi said that the signing of the Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet has guaranteed the unity of the Han and Tibetan nationalities and the unity of all ethnic groups in the country, which is worthy of celebration. Due to this unity, the construction of our country and Tibet has been developing day by day, thereby greatly improving our country's international status. Chen Yi finally said that our general slogan now is "Unity and construction are above all else," and he hoped that everyone would continue to work hard. Zhang Jingwu said in his speech that the formal establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has better guaranteed the further complete implementation of the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. We believe that some of the provisions in the agreement that have not yet been fully implemented will be gradually realized in the near future; a unified autonomous region of Tibet can be established as soon as possible to be responsible for leading Tibet's democratic reforms and socialist transformation; and the political, economic, and cultural construction undertakings in the Tibet region will be developed faster and greater in the future.

At the meeting, the Tibetan Local Government, the Panchen Kampot Conference Hall Committee, the Qamdo People's Liberation Committee, and the Lhasa Young Pioneers presented Hada scarves and flowers to Zhang Jingwu, Zhang Guohua, and the Tibetan representatives Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Kheme Soanam Wangdu, Tubdain Dandar, and Sampo Tenzin Dundrup, who participated in the signing of the agreement.

An evening party was also held after the meeting.

    拉萨各族各界一千多人集会 
    庆祝西藏和平解放五周年
    新华社拉萨23日电　拉萨市各族各界人民一千多人，今天在拉萨大礼堂集会，庆祝“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”签订五周年。中央代表团团长陈毅、副团长张经武和部分团员也出席了大会。
    今天在大会上发言的人，一致称赞西藏自解放以来，在政治、经济、文化建设各方面所获得的重大成就。西藏自治区筹备委员会秘书长阿沛·阿旺晋美说：和平解放西藏办法的协议，不仅是给西藏创造幸福的基础，而且最近成立统一的西藏自治区筹备委员会，也是具体执行这个协议的结果。西藏地方政府噶伦索康·旺清格来代表西藏地方政府在讲话中说：协议十七条是我们西藏僧俗人们走向发展、进步的依据和指针，过去执行协议的每一阶段所做的工作都是对广大藏族人民有好处的。
    在大会上发言的人，进一步提到为了促进西藏的进步和更加发展，必须实行改革。西藏自治区筹备委员会副秘书长拉敏·益喜楚臣说：我们一致拥护西藏走社会主义道路和要求改革，这是西藏民族发展、进步的正确道路。
    中共西藏工委代书记张国华在讲话中指出：现在，摆在我们面前的任务，就是根据协议的精神，结合西藏的具体情况，有步骤地进行适合于西藏民族的发展和合乎西藏人民利益的各项改革事宜，实现统一的自治区。我们将要经过充分酝酿和采取自上而下的和平协商方式逐步进行各项改革事宜。张国华接着说：进藏的人民解放军和工作人员对西藏内部改革问题，是采取积极拥护和支持的态度，但不是去包办代替。我们始终坚持着西藏固有各项制度的改革，由西藏人民以及同西藏人民有联系的领袖们自觉自愿地去进行的原则。
    陈毅和张经武也在会上讲了话。陈毅说，和平解放西藏协议的签订，使汉藏两大民族的团结和全国各民族的团结有了保障，这是值得庆贺的事情。由于这种团结，使我们和西藏的建设日益发展，从而大大地提高了我国的国际地位。陈毅最后说，我们现在总的口号是“团结建设高于一切”，他希望大家继续努力。张经武在讲话中说，现在正式成立了西藏自治区筹备委员会，这就使进一步完满地贯彻实现和平解放西藏办法的协议得到了更好的保证。我们相信在协议中至今尚未完全实施的若干规定，在不久的将来将逐步地得到实现；西藏统一的自治区能够早日建立，以便负责领导西藏的民主改革和社会主义改造；今后西藏地区的政治、经济、文化建设事业都将得到更快更大的发展。
    会议上，西藏地方政府、班禅堪布会议厅委员会、昌都地区人民解放委员会和拉萨市少先队向参加签订协议的中央代表张经武、张国华和西藏代表阿沛·阿旺晋美、凯墨·索安旺堆、土丹旦达、桑颇·登增顿珠献了哈达和鲜花。
    会后还举行了晚会。
