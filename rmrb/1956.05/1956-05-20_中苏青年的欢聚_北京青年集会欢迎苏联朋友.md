Xinhua News Agency, 19th: On the 19th – a night in early summer, more than 4,000 young people from all walks of life in the capital held a grand welcome meeting at the Zhongshan Park Music Hall for the Soviet youth delegation from Moscow.

    Wang Zhaohua, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, delivered a welcome speech. He said that under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet youth, together with the people of the whole country, are heroically fighting to realize the Soviet Union's magnificent Sixth Five-Year Plan for the transition to communism. We, the youth of Beijing, feel infinite excitement and encouragement for every achievement and creative labor of the Soviet people. With the brotherly and selfless assistance of the Soviet people, our first Five-Year Plan will surely be completed ahead of schedule and exceeded. The brotherly unity between China and the Soviet Union is a powerful guarantee for world peace, and we will make greater efforts to consolidate and develop our friendship.

    Subsequently, A. A. Laposhin, head of the Soviet youth delegation and Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union, extended the Young Communist League's greetings to the youth of Beijing on behalf of the members of the Soviet Communist Youth League and all the youth of the Soviet Union. His cordial talk was met with round after round of applause from the audience. He introduced the heroic struggle of the Soviet youth and the Soviet people to implement the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Sixth Five-Year Plan. In the past two years, the Communist Youth League has sent more than 300,000 young people to participate in land reclamation, and will send another 400,000 to 500,000 young people to participate in the construction of eastern industrial bases in the future. He said that the Party requires young people, no matter where they are, to set an example in labor, learning, and promoting the spirit of communism. He finally congratulated the further consolidation and development of the friendship between the youth of China and the Soviet Union.

    Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, also spoke, saying very enthusiastically: On behalf of the youth of Beijing and the whole country, I express my infinite respect to the Soviet people and the Soviet youth. With the help of the Soviet Union, our country will become more prosperous. The achievements of Soviet construction are the gospel of the people all over the world. Whether in the past, present, or future, we must learn from the Soviet people and the Soviet youth. The friendship between the youth of China and the Soviet Union will be infinitely strengthened. We, the Chinese people and youth, will forever stand together with the heroic Soviet people and youth, and our common cause will achieve new and great victories.

    After Hu Yaobang finished speaking, he and the representatives stepped down from the podium, and the youth of the audience immediately surrounded them. After the meeting, Peking opera and song and dance performances were performed.

    The Soviet youth delegation arrived in Beijing on the 18th. They were invited by the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League to come to China for a friendly visit and exchange of work experience.
