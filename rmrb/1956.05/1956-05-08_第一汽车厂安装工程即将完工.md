Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 6th: Rows of new-style machines have been installed in every tall factory building of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. The installation projects of the auxiliary, carpentry, wire drawing, and model factories—which started installation earliest and progressed faster—have been completely handed over. Equipment installation in the other six factory buildings is about 90% complete.

Currently, the workers responsible for the installation project at this factory are carrying out installation work such as positioning, drilling, piping, and wiring for some late-arriving equipment, based on the overall progress of various finishing projects. Some installation workers are also replenishing missing parts for some equipment so that this equipment can be put into production quickly. The office staff in the electromechanical installation company are drawing completion diagrams and organizing various handover and acceptance data. They will prepare for the acceptance of various installation projects throughout the factory within the next two months.

The early completion of civil engineering projects and the strong support from equipment manufacturing plants across the country, as well as the cooperation of various workshops within the factory, have created very favorable conditions for the installation project, enabling the installation workers to complete about 50% of the factory's equipment installation projects during the three and a half months of winter construction. At present, various production workshops have entered the stage of adjusting production or trial production in assembly line. The foundry workshop, which started installation last, also produced castings three months ahead of schedule. The installation projects of the five power stations—thermal power station, gas station, compressed air station, oxygen station, and acetylene station—will be basically completed this month and early June.

　　第一汽车厂安装工程即将完工
    新华社长春6日电  在第一汽车制造厂各个高大的厂房里，都安上了一行行新式的机器。最早开始安装和安装进度较快的辅助、木工、拔丝、模型等四个厂房的安装工程，已经整体交工了；另外六个厂房的设备安装，也完成了90％左右。
    现在，担负这个工厂安装工程的职工们，正在根据各项收尾工程的综合进度，给一些后到的设备进行定位、打眼、配管、配线等安装工作；还有些安装工人，在给一部分设备补装缺件，使这些设备很快都能够投入生产。伏在机电安装公司办公桌上的科室工作人员，已经在绘制竣工图和整理各项交工验收资料，他们要在最近两个月以内，作好全厂各项安装工程的验收准备工作。
    土木建筑工程的提前完工和全国各个设备承制厂的有力支援，以及厂内各车间的配合，给安装工程创造了很有利的条件，使安装工人在三个半月的冬季施工中，完成了全厂50％左右的设备安装工程。目前，各个生产车间都已经进入调整生产或流水试生产。最后开始安装的铸工车间，也提前三个月生产出铸件。热电站、煤气站、压缩空气站、氧气站、乙炔站等五个动力站的安装工程，都将在本月和六月初基本完成。
