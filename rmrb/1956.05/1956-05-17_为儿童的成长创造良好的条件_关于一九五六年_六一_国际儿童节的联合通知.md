    Creating Good Conditions for Children's Growth
    ——Joint Notice Regarding the 1956 "June 1st" International Children's Day——
    This year's "June 1st" International Children's Day comes at a time when the forces defending world peace are even stronger, and when the Chinese people are in the midst of a high tide of socialist construction. Looking back over the past year, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, our country's work in protecting and educating children, like other aspects of socialist construction, has made great progress on the basis of the achievements made in previous years. Child health care and nursery work have been widely and rapidly developed in vast rural and urban areas; the quality of school education has improved to a certain extent; the number of members in the Young Pioneers, the organization of children themselves, has greatly increased in the past year; after-school educational institutions for children have gradually increased; the creation of children's literature and art has begun to flourish; all relevant parties are also strengthening the organization of cultural activities for children; more parents are paying attention to improving family education for children; and a new atmosphere of caring for children is also growing in society.
    These achievements in children's work are a clear sign that we adults are actively participating in socialist construction and have achieved great success. The healthy growth of children brings us greater encouragement and hope. We are advancing towards socialism with full confidence. Let us complete and overfulfill our various work tasks with greater enthusiasm, strengthen the struggle to defend peace, and lay a more solid foundation for the happy lives of children; and unremittingly strengthen and improve the work of cultivating and educating children.
    We must establish such an idea in the whole society, and give children a good educational influence in our entire social life. All adults should influence children with their own good behavior, educate them correctly, and become good examples for children in all aspects of work, study, and life. All aspects should create good conditions for children's growth as much as possible, and infect and educate children with all the fresh and advanced things in our socialist construction, so that they can grow into outstanding children of the great motherland who love the motherland, love knowledge and labor, are healthy, lively, brave, honest, and have a spirit of innovation.
    All state organs and people's organizations that directly or indirectly serve children have the responsibility to help the masses learn and master the knowledge and methods of educating children, and help parents to raise and educate their children correctly; they should use various conditions to establish a wide variety of childcare organizations and further improve childcare work. All units should, according to their own business characteristics, create various types of after-school educational institutions for school-age children, or help these institutions to carry out their work, and more widely carry out children's extracurricular and after-school activities, as well as vacation and rest work. More children's literature, comic books, and films, dramas, art, music, dance and other works suitable for children should be created, and cultural and artistic activities for children should be strengthened. Children's theaters should be opened in cinemas and theaters, and children's reading rooms and activity places should be opened in libraries, cultural centers, clubs, Sino-Soviet Friendship Centers, etc., where conditions permit, and various activities should be organized for children. Primary schools in urban and rural areas with the conditions should organize children to listen to radio programs for children. In cities and rural areas, attention should be paid as much as possible to more widely carrying out sports activities for children to enhance their physical fitness. Industrial, mining, agricultural, forestry, health departments, scientific organizations, and experts should provide technical guidance and specific assistance for children's scientific and technological activities.
    Scientists, writers, artists, combat heroes, model workers, and advanced workers in various positions should meet with children as much as possible and establish contact with them. Writers should strive to improve the level of children's literature creation, so that children's literature can become a truly vibrant part of our country's socialist literature. Artists should strive for the vigorous development of children's drama, art, music, dance and other creative activities.
    Schools and families are the centers for conducting socialist education for children. All parents and childcare and education workers directly shoulder the responsibility of cultivating and educating children. Therefore, they are required to strive to improve the work of education and upbringing of children, cooperate with each other, and work closely together to cultivate outstanding citizens of socialist society.
    In order to widely and deeply publicize and implement the above-mentioned work, and promote all units to carry out and strengthen children's work through the "June 1st" activities, local departments and relevant departments and people's organizations can jointly form a preparatory committee for celebrating the "June 1st" International Children's Day, and carry out relevant work and activities with reference to previous years' methods, such as holding various small-scale symposiums for adults, holding exhibitions, lectures, etc., and using newspapers, periodicals, and radio stations to carry out extensive publicity. Around "June 1st", it is even more necessary to mobilize relevant forces to organize rich and colorful celebration activities for children according to their age characteristics, so that they can spend their holidays happily.

    为儿童的成长创造良好的条件
    ——关于一九五六年“六一”国际儿童节的联合通知——
    今年“六一”国际儿童节正是处在世界保卫和平的力量更加强大的形势下，处在我国人民建设社会主义的高潮中。回顾过去一年，我们国家保卫和教育儿童的工作，在党和人民政府的领导下，像社会主义建设事业的其他各项工作一样，在前几年所取得的成绩的基础上，有了很大的进展。在广大农村和城市中，儿童保健、保育工作有了广泛、迅速的开展；学校教育的质量有了一定的提高；少年儿童自己的组织——少年先锋队在这一年里队员的数字有了大量的增加；儿童校外教育机构逐渐增多；儿童文学、艺术作品的创作活动已经开始活跃；各有关方面也在加强组织少年儿童文化活动的工作；更多的父母们注意了改善对儿童的家庭教育；社会上爱护儿童的新气象也在增长。
    儿童工作方面的这些成绩，正是我们成人们积极参加社会主义建设，并且取得了巨大成就的一个鲜明的标志。儿童们的健全成长，给我们带来了更大的鼓舞和希望，我们正满怀信心地向社会主义前进，让我们以更大的热情来完成和超额完成我们的各项工作任务，加强保卫和平的斗争，为儿童们的幸福生活打下更坚实的基础；并且不懈地加强和改善培养教育儿童的工作。
    我们要在全社会树立这样一个思想，要在我们的整个社会生活中给予儿童良好的教育影响。所有的成人都用自己的优良行为来影响儿童，正确地教育儿童，无论在工作、学习、生活各方面都成为儿童的好榜样，各方面都要尽可能地为儿童的成长创造良好的条件，以我们社会主义建设中一切新鲜的、先进的事物来感染和教育儿童，使他们成长为热爱祖国、热爱知识和劳动，健壮、活泼、勇敢、诚实和具有创造精神的伟大祖国的优秀儿女。
    所有直接、间接为儿童服务的国家机关、人民团体都有责任帮助群众学习和掌握教育儿童的知识和方法，帮助父母正确地抚养和教育子女；应该运用各种条件，更广泛地设立多种多样的托儿组织，进一步改善儿童保育工作。各个单位要根据自己的业务特点，为学龄儿童创设各种不同类型的校外教育机构，或者帮助这些机构进行工作，更广泛地开展儿童的课外和校外活动，以及假期休息工作等。要更多的创作儿童文学作品、连环画册和适合儿童的电影、戏剧、美术、音乐、舞蹈等作品，加强文化艺术为儿童服务的活动，在电影院、剧场开辟儿童场，在图书馆、有条件的文化馆、俱乐部、中苏友好馆等开辟儿童阅览室和儿童活动场所，为儿童组织各种活动。有条件的城乡各小学要组织儿童收听对少年儿童的广播节目。在城市和农村，都要尽可能地注意更广泛地开展少年儿童的体育活动，以增强他们的体质。工矿、农林、卫生部门和科学团体，以及专家们，要对儿童的科学技术活动给予技术指导和具体帮助。
    科学家们、作家们、艺术家们以及战斗英雄、劳动模范和各种岗位上的先进工作者们，要尽可能多地和儿童见面，和他们建立联系。作家们要为提高儿童文学创作水平而努力，使儿童文学成为我国社会主义文学中真正有生气的一部分。艺术家们，要为儿童的戏剧、美术、音乐、舞蹈等创作活动的蓬勃开展而努力。
    学校和家庭是对儿童进行社会主义教育的中心，所有的父母和儿童保育、教育工作者们都直接担负着培养教育儿童的责任。因此要求他们努力改进教育和教养儿童的工作，彼此互相配合，密切合作，以培养社会主义社会的优秀公民。
    为了广泛深入地宣传贯彻上述工作，通过“六一”活动推动各个单位开展和加强儿童工作，各地各有关部门和人民团体可以联合组成庆祝“六一”国际儿童节筹委会，参照往年办法，开展有关的工作和活动。如召开成年人的各种小型的座谈会，举办展览、讲座等。并且要运用报纸刊物和广播电台进行广泛的宣传。在“六一”节日前后更要动员有关力量按照儿童的年龄特点为他们组织丰富多采的庆祝活动，让他们愉快欢乐地度过自己的节日。
