　　Promote Putonghua and Popularize Pinyin Knowledge: Wu
　　Yuzhang's Speech at the National Conference of Advanced Producers

    Wu Yuzhang, Director of the Chinese Writing Reform Committee and Chairman of the National Committee of the Educational Workers' Union of China, expressed his hope at the National Conference of Advanced Producers on the 8th that advanced producers and advanced workers should also become advanced figures in promoting writing reform. They should learn Putonghua, learn the Pinyin alphabet, and vigorously promote Putonghua and popularize Pinyin knowledge among the masses.

    Wu Yuzhang said that the language of the Han people in our country—Chinese—has serious dialectal differences, and the pronunciation is extremely inconsistent, which greatly hinders the exchange of ideas and joint work among people in various regions. Especially today, when our country is carrying out large-scale socialist construction, a worker or engineering technician may be sent to work in a newly built factory in a distant place at any time. A science and education worker or an office worker may also be sent to any place where work is needed for the needs of the work. Especially in this era, it is impossible or unlikely for a person to stay in his hometown for the rest of his life. Everyone may go to other places to attend meetings, work, or study. This means that Putonghua is essential for everyone. For the benefit of the further unification and development of our country's politics, economy, culture, and national defense, and for the smooth promotion of phonetic writing in the future, we must vigorously promote Putonghua—the common language of the Han nationality—with Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation, the Northern dialect as the basic dialect, and exemplary modern vernacular writings as the grammatical standard.

    Wu Yuzhang pointed out that in order to promote Putonghua, there must be a set of scientific and reasonable phonetic alphabets as tools for phonetic notation and pronunciation correction. The "Draft Plan for Chinese Phoneticization" published by the Chinese Writing Reform Committee in February this year can be used to annotate Chinese characters and help teaching and promoting Putonghua. This Pinyin scheme is very easy to learn. It has only thirty letters, and people with a junior high school education level can generally learn it in just ten hours. People with a slightly lower cultural level can learn it in twenty or thirty hours. Learning this set of Pinyin letters is very convenient for further learning Putonghua. Promoting this set of Pinyin letters, so that many people understand the Pinyin method and develop the habit of Pinyin, will also prepare conditions for the smooth promotion of phonetic writing in the future.

### 推广普通话，普及拼音知识吴  玉章在全国先进生产者代表会议上讲话

　　玉章在全国先进生产者代表会议上讲话
    中国文字改革委员会主任、中国教育工会全国委员会主席吴玉章，八日在全国先进生产者代表会议上讲话的时候，希望先进生产者和先进工作者，同时成为推行文字改革的先进人物，要学习普通话，学习拼音字母，并且在群众中大力推广普通话，普及拼音知识。
    吴玉章说，我国汉族人民的语言——汉语，存在着严重的方言分歧，语音极不统一，使得各地人民交流思想、共同工作受到很大障碍。尤其是在我国进行大规模社会主义建设的今天，一个工人或工程技术人员，随时有可能被派遣到一个远方的新建的工厂里去工作，一个科学教育工作者或一个机关工作者，为了工作的需要，也随时有可能派到任何一个工作所需要的地方去。特别在现在这样的时代，一个人是不可能或者不大可能一辈子老守在本乡本土的。每一个人都有可能到别的地方去开会、工作或学习。这就是说，普通话对于每一个人都是十分必需的。为了我国政治、经济、文化、国防的进一步统一和发展的利益，为了将来拼音文字的顺利推行，必须大力推广以北京语音为标准音、以北方话为基础方言、以典范的现代白话文著作为语法规范的普通话——汉民族共同语。
    吴玉章指出，为了推广普通话，就必须有一套科学合理的拼音字母来作注音和正音的工具。今年二月中国文字改革委员会发表的“汉语拼音方案（草案）”，就可以用来给汉字注音，并且帮助教学推广普通话。这个拼音方案是很容易学的，它只有三十个字母，有初中程度文化水平的人，一般只要十个小时就可以学会。文化水平低一点的人，二、三十个小时也就学会了。学会了这套拼音字母，对于进一步学习普通话有很大方便。推广这套拼音字母，使得很多人都懂得拼音方法，养成拼音习惯，也就为将来顺利推行拼音文字准备条件。
