    Criticism Should Be Sharper
    On May 8th, the Anhui Daily published a short article: "The Right of Party Members to 'Criticize Any Party Worker at Party Meetings' Should Be Fully Respected." The article criticized a county for not fully promoting democracy when convening a Party Congress. The head of the directly subordinate organs delegation of this county had repeatedly requested to speak at the Congress to criticize the shortcomings and errors of certain members of the County Party Committee, but his request was not approved by the Presidium of the Congress. When a certain delegate criticized the leading cadres of the county in his speech, a responsible staff member not only did not listen with an open mind but also expressed dissatisfaction and asked for the name of the critic.
    Whether a Party Congress can be successful depends first and foremost on whether democracy is fully promoted. And the key to fully promoting democracy lies in whether the responsible Party cadres have a spirit of self-criticism and whether they welcome and protect criticism from below. The Anhui Daily raised this issue through such examples when the Party Congresses or representative meetings were about to be widely convened in the counties and cities of Anhui, which was obviously helpful to promoting the success of Party meetings in various places.
    Regrettably, the criticism in this short article is not specific enough and not sharp enough. Which county did this happen in? Who rudely obstructed the Party members from exercising their democratic rights? All of these are mysteries to the readers.

    Cannot Be "Single-Track"
    In some areas, there has been a "single-track" phenomenon in rural production work: only paying attention to agricultural production and not to sideline production; only paying attention to the production of food crops and not to the production of diverse cash crops. There is also this "single-track" phenomenon in the propaganda of some farmers' newspapers. According to a newspaper review published in the Fujian Daily on May 13th, recently, while guiding grain production, newspapers in various parts of Fujian have generally neglected the propaganda of diverse cash crops and sideline production. Many mountain newspapers have both a small quantity and poor quality of propaganda on forestry production. The tea of northern Fujian is famous throughout the country, but the Northern Fujian People's Daily does not pay attention to the reporting of tea production. In the newspapers of coastal areas, there is very little reporting on fishery production. Local newspapers also lack due guidance on the production of cash crops such as soybeans, peanuts, sugarcane, and native tobacco, as well as sideline production such as papermaking.
    It is right for newspapers to attach importance to the propaganda of increasing grain production; however, it is wrong to neglect the production of cash crops and sideline production and not to carry out propaganda based on the economic characteristics of the local area. The matter is very clear: the country and the people certainly need to increase the production of more grain, but at the same time, they also need to increase the production of various cash crops according to plan. And for agricultural cooperatives, it is only by developing diverse economies, increasing production, and increasing the income of the members that there is more guarantee. The issue raised by the Fujian Daily is worthy of attention by farmers' newspapers in various places.

    "Ding Gui's Happiness and Distress"
    Ding Gui is a coil winding worker at the Shenyang Transformer Factory. In half a year of 1953, he found more than fifty production tips, some of which were very valuable. Therefore, the leaders praised him at large and small meetings, calling on everyone to "take Ding Gui as an example" and "learn from Ding Gui." His model deeds were also made into a documentary film by the Northeast Film Studio.
    After this, Ding Gui became arrogant and did not work hard. When the workers criticized him, he said: "Even the leaders have not given me, Lao Ding, any advice, yet you are more enlightened than the leaders!" And it was really the case. The workers reported the opinions to the workshop director, but he did not deal with them and said: "Ding Gui is the 'tip king' of our workshop, and we should establish his prestige!" The branch, the Party Committee, and the factory director also did not pay attention to this matter.
    When Ding Gui had a series of quality accidents, and even developed to the point of writing a factory return application, the leaders then became busy with Ding Gui's affairs: criticizing him at large and small meetings, transferring him to the boiler room to carry coal,…. The Communist Youth League organization also expelled him from the League. In this way, Ding Gui changed from "tip king" to "waste king," and from happiness to distress.
    The Shenyang Daily of May 9th introduced this matter in an article entitled "Ding Gui's Happiness and Distress." Just as this newspaper said in a commentary published on the same day, important lessons should be learned from this incident. What is the lesson? You can look again at a passage from the article "Ding Gui's Happiness and Distress": This year, Ding Gui was happy again in January. A new Party Committee secretary came to the factory, he discovered this problem, raised it to the Party Committee meeting for research, and examined the shortcomings in the leadership work. The secretary himself also talked with Ding Gui to help him recognize his past shortcomings, and the factory director also ordered Ding Gui to be transferred back to his original job. Ding Gui became active again and is striving to become an advanced producer. The article concludes: Now "the leadership is different from the past, and it not only praises Ding Gui but also points out his shortcomings in a timely manner." Here, it not only says out the lesson but also says out the method of accepting the lesson.
    Just when the advanced producer movement is flourishing everywhere, introducing such examples as Ding Gui in the newspaper will be a very good cooling agent for some enterprise leaders. This article also points out to the newspaper: not only should it report on the progress and achievements in the advanced producer movement, but it should also raise the problems and lessons in it.

    在各地报纸上
    批评应当尖锐些
    五月八日，安徽日报刊出了一篇短文：“应当十分尊重党员‘在党的会议上批评党的任何工作人员’的权利”。文中批评了一个县在召开党代表大会的时候，没有充分发扬民主。这个县的直属机关代表团团长曾经不止一次地要求在大会上发言，对县委某些委员的缺点和错误提出批评，但是他的要求竟没有得到大会主席团的批准。某代表在发言中批评了县的领导干部，有一个负责工作人员不但不虚心倾听，反而表示不满，并且追问批评者的姓名。
    党的代表大会能不能开得好，首先要看是否充分发扬了民主。而要充分发扬民主，关键又在党的负责干部有没有自我批评精神，是不是欢迎和保护自下而上的批评。安徽日报在安徽各县、市即将普遍召开党的代表大会或代表会议的时候，通过这样的事例提出这个问题，对推动各地开好党的会议显然是有帮助的。
    遗憾的是，这篇短文中的批评不够具体、不够尖锐。究竟是哪一个县的事情？谁粗暴地阻挠了党员行使民主权利？所有这些对读者来说，是一个谜。
    不能“单打一”
    有些地区的农村生产工作曾经出现过“单打一”的现象：只注意农业生产，不注意副业生产；只注意粮食作物的生产，不注意多种经济作物的生产。有些农民报纸的宣传也有这种“单打一”的现象。据福建日报五月十三日发表的一篇报纸评介说，最近一个时期，福建各地报纸在指导粮食生产的同时，普遍地忽视了多种经济作物和副业生产的宣传。许多山区的报纸关于林业生产的宣传数量既少，质量又差。闽北的茶叶是全国有名的，但是闽北人民报却不注意茶叶生产的报道。在沿海地区的报纸上，渔业生产的报道很少。各地报纸对于大豆、花生、甘蔗、土烟等经济作物的生产，以及造纸等副业生产，也缺乏应有的指导。
    报纸重视粮食增产的宣传，这是对的；但是忽视经济作物的生产和副业生产，不从本地区的经济特点出发进行宣传，就不对了。事情很明白：国家和人民固然需要增产更多的粮食，同时也需要按照计划增产各种经济作物。而对于农业合作社来说，也只有发展多种经济，增加生产、增加社员的收入才更有保证。福建日报提出的这个问题，值得各地农民报纸注意。
    “丁贵的愉快和苦恼”
    丁贵是沈阳变压器厂的卷线工人。他在1953年的半年工夫里，找到了五十多个生产窍门，其中有些很有价值。于是，领导者在大小会议上都表扬他，号召大家“以丁贵为榜样”、“向丁贵学习”。他的模范事迹还被东北电影制片厂拍成了纪录影片。
    这以后，丁贵便骄傲起来，不好好干活。工人批评他，他说：“连领导上还没给我老丁提过一条意见呢，你们倒比领导英明了！”事情也真是这样，工人把意见反映给车间主任，他不处理，还说：“丁贵是我们车间的窍门大王，应当树立他的威信！”支部、党委和厂长，也都不过问这件事情。
    当丁贵接连出了质量事故，甚至发展到写退厂申请书的时候，领导者这才为丁贵的事情忙起来了：在大会小会上批评他，调他到锅炉房抬煤，……。青年团组织还开除了他的团籍。这样，丁贵由“窍门大王”变为“废品大王”，由愉快一变而为苦恼。
    五月九日的沈阳日报，在一篇题为“丁贵的愉快和苦恼”的文章里介绍了这件事情。正像这个报纸在同天发表的一篇评论中说的，从这件事当中，应该吸取到重要的教训。教训是什么呢？可以再看看“丁贵的愉快和苦恼”一文里的一段报道：今年一月丁贵又愉快了。这个工厂新来了一位党委书记，他发现了这个问题，把它提到党委会上作了研究，检查了领导工作中的缺点。书记本人又同丁贵谈话，帮助他认识自己过去的缺点，厂长还下命令把丁贵调回原来的工作岗位。丁贵又积极起来，正在争取当先进生产者。文章最后写道：现在“领导上和过去不同了，对丁贵不仅有表扬，还及时地指出他的缺点。”这里，就不只说出了教训，也说出了接受教训的方法。
    正当先进生产者运动到处蓬勃开展的时候，在报纸上介绍丁贵这样的事例，对一些企业领导者将会是一付很好的清凉剂。这篇文章也向报纸指出了：不单要报道先进生产者运动中的进步和成绩，也要提出其中的问题和教训。
