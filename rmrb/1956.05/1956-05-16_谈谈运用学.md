Talking About Operations Research
Xu Guozhi

Operations research, as a discipline, is still quite immature. It originated during World War II. At that time, due to the demands of the war, many scientists from various fields were invited to solve problems that did not belong to any specific discipline. They brought the experience from their respective fields to try and solve those new problems, and thus accumulated a lot of experience. After the war, some operations research practitioners engaged in the application of operations research in industry, commerce, transportation, and so on. Operations research has its own problems and methods, but it still lacks a complete system. Below are a few examples to illustrate the content of this discipline.

For example, the shuttle bus in an organization picks up and drops off employees during work hours, but the employees are scattered in various locations. An obvious question is which house should be visited first, and then which house, and so on, arranging a sequence so that the total distance traveled by the shuttle bus is the shortest. If they all lived on one road, this problem would be simple, but the reality is often not the case. If there were only the Zhang and Wang families, it would also be easy to solve. Calculate how much road it takes to go to the Zhang family first and then the Wang family, and then calculate how much road it takes to go to the Wang family first and then the Zhang family. Comparing the two, we can get the result. Imagine adding a Zhao family, then there would be six different possible routes: first to the Wang family, then to the Zhang family, and finally to the Zhao family, first to the Wang family, then to the Zhao family, and finally to the Zhang family, and so on. This calculation procedure is more complicated. Obviously, a shuttle bus picks up and drops off more than just three families. If we calculate like this, it is too uneconomical. Therefore, we must rely on some scientific methods.

Now let us continue to discuss some examples.

In mass production, in industrial construction, we often encounter the problem of testing finished products or materials. Most of the time, the number of specimens to be tested is large, and there may be several places where tests can be performed. The properties of each type of specimen are different, and the equipment and personnel experience in each laboratory are also different. Therefore, the operating time required for a certain type of specimen in a certain laboratory varies. Suppose there are three laboratories. The first and second laboratories can simultaneously test 25 pieces each, and the third laboratory can test 50 pieces. We have four types of specimens, and their numbers are: the first type 15 pieces, the second type 20 pieces, the third type 30 pieces, and the fourth type 35 pieces. In the first laboratory, the single-piece test times required for each type of specimen are: the first type 10 minutes, the second type 5 minutes, the third type 6 minutes, and the fourth type 7 minutes. In the second laboratory, they are 8 minutes, 2 minutes, 7 minutes, and 6 minutes respectively. In the third laboratory, they are 9 minutes, 3 minutes, 4 minutes, and 8 minutes respectively. The total number of specimens of each type is exactly equal to the number of specimens that the three laboratories can operate simultaneously. The question is how to allocate the work so that the total test time is the shortest.

We may make the following seemingly reasonable analysis. But it doesn't give us the correct answer. We see that among all the tests, the single-piece test time for the second type of specimen in the second laboratory is the shortest, only 2 minutes. At the same time, there are only 20 pieces of the second type of specimen, so we naturally put the entire second type in the second laboratory. In this way, the second laboratory still has surplus capacity, because it can operate 25 pieces simultaneously. Among the remaining three types, the single-piece test time for the fourth type in the second laboratory is the shortest, 6 minutes. At the same time, the fourth type will require 7 minutes or 8 minutes in other laboratories. Then, of course, we put 5 pieces of the fourth type in the second laboratory. In the remaining specimens, the third type of specimen requires the shortest time in the third laboratory, 4 minutes. At the same time, there are only 30 pieces of the third type, so we put them all in the third laboratory. Now the third laboratory can do another 20 pieces. But in the remaining specimens, the fourth type is more economical in the third laboratory, 8 minutes. Therefore, put 20 pieces of the fourth type in the third laboratory. The remaining pieces are placed in the first laboratory, namely 15 pieces of the first type and 10 pieces of the fourth type. This seemingly reasonable allocation requires a total test time of 570 minutes. But the really good allocation only needs 535 minutes. How to find the best allocation? This requires the use of operations research. However, because the principle and description of the allocation method are relatively complex, and some mathematics is required, we cannot describe it in detail here. However, we can write the answer below for reference. All 15 pieces of the first type are placed in the second laboratory, all 20 pieces of the second type and 30 pieces of the third type are placed in the third laboratory, 25 pieces of the fourth type are placed in the first laboratory, and the remaining 10 pieces are placed in the second laboratory.

Everyone will see the importance of this particular problem in the national economy and industrial construction very clearly, and we will not emphasize it further. What I want to explain here is that this represents a large type of problem in operations research. They are everywhere in the national economy and industrial construction. Often the numbers involved are large, so what is saved is no longer a few tens of minutes, but may be tens of thousands of RMB, or hundreds of tons of valuable raw materials. Mentioning the problem of "cement mix" here is helpful for understanding. Different grades of cement may have different properties, such as strength, setting speed, and so on. In different applications, the requirements for various properties are also different. If we don't spare costs and always use the best cement, then the problem is simple. Obviously, we are unwilling to do so. Therefore, we have to mix cement so that the properties of the product are within the required range, and the cost is the lowest. Operations research is also used here.

In operations research, there is another major type of problem that can be illustrated by the following example.

A submarine passes through a river channel. If its submerged length is shorter than the river channel, then it must surface somewhere when passing through. An aircraft is ordered to reconnaissance the submarine. Because the river channel is very long, for effective reconnaissance, it often chooses a point on the river channel to fly back and forth for reconnaissance. At that reconnaissance point, if the submarine dives to the bottom, it can escape. Otherwise, there is a possibility of being detected. However, due to different terrains, the probability of being detected also varies from place to place. The aircraft cannot always conduct reconnaissance at one point every day, so after the submarine grasps this situation, it dives to the bottom at that point, so it can escape. Therefore, the aircraft must change the reconnaissance location every day to achieve the effect of unpredictability. Similarly, the submarine must also change the section where it surfaces and dives every day. In this case, neither side has a way of knowing the other's tactics. The question is, which locations should the aircraft choose for reconnaissance so that, no matter which section the submarine surfaces and dives in, the probability of it being detected by the aircraft is at least a certain fixed value. At the same time, the submarine should also try to choose a tactic, diving in a certain section and surfacing in a certain section, so that no matter which locations the aircraft chooses for reconnaissance, the probability of it being detected by the aircraft is at most no greater than a certain fixed value. Using more complex mathematics, this problem can be solved, at least in theory. Here the two fixed values are equal, that is, if evenly matched, the victory or defeat of this war has been fixed by the terrain.

This example is linked to a principle, which is the famous "minimax" theorem. Let's briefly describe the content of this theorem. Authorities A and B have no way of knowing or controlling what tactics the other party will take. But they can freely choose their own tactics. For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that both parties A and B have two tactics to take. Party A can do such an analysis: If it takes the first tactic, what will be the results of Party B taking the first or second tactic? Although Party A has no way of knowing or controlling which tactic Party B will take, Party A can at least see what the worst outcome is in this case. When Party A plans to take the second tactic, it can also do the same analysis. But Party A can choose its own tactics, so it naturally chooses the best one among the two worst outcomes. This is the origin of the name "minimax" theorem. Party B can also do the same analysis and get a result. The question is whether the results obtained by parties A and B after doing the same analysis are the same. The content of the "minimax" theorem is to prove that, under certain circumstances, the results obtained by parties A and B are the same.

Now we can see the complexity of the aircraft reconnaissance submarine problem. The aircraft can choose any location along the river channel for reconnaissance, that is, the aircraft has infinitely many tactics to take. The same is true for the submarine. This makes analysis and calculation very complicated. In this type of problem, many have to use electronic computers to perform calculations. Therefore, finding a simple calculation method is very important.

Through the above examples, we can see some of the content of operations research, as well as its practical significance for the national economy and national defense. We are engaged in socialist construction and developing scientific research. We will encounter many problems, such as product serialization, the grading of railway stations, the planning of new cities, the design and selection of stations, the connection between transportation systems, and the principles for selecting transportation tools. Here, the methods of operations research are helpful for the analysis and solution of problems.

    谈谈运用学
    许国志
    运用学这门学科在目前还很不成熟。它发源于第二次世界大战期间。当时由于战争情况的要求，许许多多各门各类的科学家被请来解决不属于任何专门学科的问题。他们把他们各自本行中的经验搬来尝试解决那些新问题，因此积累了不少经验。战后，一些运用学的工作者便从事于运用学在工商业、交通和运输等等方面的应用。运用学有它自己的问题和方法，但是还缺少一个完整的体系。在下面举几个例子，来说明一下这门学科的内容。
    比如说，一个机关里的交通车在上班、下班的时候要接送职工，而职工们却散居各处。一个显然的问题就是应该先到那一家，然后再到那一家，如是等等，排成一个次序，使得交通车所走的总距离是最短。如果他们都住在一条路上，这问题便简单，可是事实往往不是如此。如果只有张王两家，那么也好解决。算一下，先到张家后到王家要走多少路，再算一下先到王家后到张家要走多少路。两者一比，我们便能得出结果。假想再添一个赵家，那便有六种不同的可能走法，分别是：先到王家再到张家最后到赵家，先到王家再到赵家最后到张家等等。这样计算的手续便比较复杂。很显然，一个交通车决不止接送三家。如果这样扳指头死算，实在太不经济。因此必须借重一些科学方法。
    现在让我们继续讨论一些例子。
    在大量生产中，在工业建设中，往往碰到成品或者是材料的试验问题。大多时候，将要被试验的试件数目很大，而能够做试验的场所也可能有好几个。每一类试件的性质不同，每一试验室的设备及人员的经验也不一样，因此某一类试件在某一试验室需要的操作时间也就各异。假如有三个试验室。第一室同第二室同时能试验二十五件，第三试验室五十件。我们有四类试件，它们的数目分别是：第一类十五件、第二类二十件、第三类三十件、第四类三十五件。在第一试验室里面，各类试件需要的单件试验时间分别是：第一类十分钟、第二类五分钟、第三类六分钟、第四类七分钟。在第二试验室里面分别是：八分钟、两分钟、七分钟及六分钟。在第三试验室里面分别是：九分钟、三分钟、四分钟、八分钟。各类试件的总件数恰好等于三个试验室能够同时操作的件数。问题是如何分配工作，使得总试验时间最短。
    我们可能作下面这样看起来似乎很合理的分析。但是它并不能给我们正确的答案。我们看到在所有的试验中间，第二类试件在第二试验室里面的单件试验时间最短，只有二分钟。同时第二类试件也只有二十件，我们自然把整个第二类都放在第二试验室。这样，第二试验室还有剩余力量，因为它同时可以操作二十五件。在其余的三类中间，在第二试验室里面单件试验时间是第四类最短，六分钟。同时第四类如果在其他试验室里面，将分别需要七分钟或者是八分钟。则我们当然把五件第四类的试件放在第二室。在剩余下来的试件里面，第三类试件在第三试验室里面需要的时间最短，四分钟。同时第三类也只有三十件，所以我们把它都放在第三试验室。现在第三试验室还可以再做二十件。但是在剩余的试件里面，第四类在第三试验室较为经济，八分钟。因此放二十件第四类的在第三试验室。剩余下来的放在第一试验室里面，分别是第一类十五件及第四类十件。这个看起来很合理的分配，总共需要试验时间五百七十分钟。但是真正好的分配只需要五百三十五分钟。怎样求出这最好的分配呢？这就要用到运用学了。但是因为分法的原理和叙述，都较为复杂，而且要用到一些数学，所以我们在这里无法详述。不过我们可以把答案写在下面，以作参考。第一类的十五件都放在第二试验室，第二类的二十件和第三类的三十件都放在第三试验室，第四类的二十五件放在第一试验室，其余十件放在第二试验室。
    这一个特殊问题，在国民经济和工业建设中的重要性，每个人都会看得很清楚的，我们不再强调说明了。这里想加以说明的是这代表着运用学中一大类型的问题。它们在国民经济和工业建设中，到处都是。往往那里牵涉到的数字很大，因此省下来的不再是几十分钟，而可能是成千整万的人民币，或者是几百吨的宝贵原料。在这里提一提“水泥配合”的问题是有助于理解的。不同标号的水泥，便可能有不同的性质，例如强度，凝结的速度等等。在不同的应用中，对各种性质的要求也不一样。如果我们不惜工本，总是用最好的水泥，这样，问题也简单。显然我们是不愿这样做的。因此我们便要配合水泥，使得产品的性质在要求的范围以内，同时成本最低。这里也就要用到运用学了。
    在运用学中，还有一大类型的问题可以通过下面一个例子来说明。
    一只潜水艇通过一条河道。如果它的潜水长度比较河道短，那么在通过的时候，它总得在什么地方浮出水面。一只飞机奉命去侦察潜水艇。因为河道很长，为了有效侦察起见，往往是选择河道的一点来往返飞行侦察。在那侦察地点，如果潜水艇潜入水底，它便能逃走。否则就有被侦察到的可能。但是因地形不同，被侦察到的概率也随地而异。飞机不能天天总在一点侦察，这样潜水艇掌握了这情况以后，便在那一点潜入水底，因此便能逃走。所以飞机必须天天变换侦察地点，以收变化莫测之妙。同样潜水艇也必须天天变换它出水入水的地段。在这种情况下，双方都没有办法晓得对方的战术。问题是飞机应该选择那些地点进行侦察，无论潜水艇在那些地段出水入水，它侦察到潜水艇的概率至少是某一个固定值。同时潜水艇也应该设法选择一个战术，在某段入水，在某段出水，使得无论飞机选择那些地点侦察，它被飞机侦察到的概率至多不大过某一个固定值。用了较复杂的数学，这问题是可以解决的，至少在理论上。在这里那两个固定值相等，也就是说，如果棋逢敌手的话，这场战争的谁胜谁败已经为地形所固定了。
    这个例子联系着一个原理，那就是著名的“最小最大”定理。这个定理的内容我们来简括地叙述一下。当局甲、乙双方对于对方采取什么样的战术，没有办法晓得，也没有办法控制。但是自己却可以任意选择自己的战术。为了简化起见，我们假想甲、乙双方都各有两种战术可以采取。甲方可以做这样一个分析：如果自己采取第一种战术，乙采取第一种或第二种战术的结果分别是怎样？虽然甲没有办法晓得或控制乙采取那一种战术，但是甲至少能够看到，在这种情况下，最坏的结局是什么。甲打算采取第二个战术的时候，也可以做同样的分析。但是甲可以选择自己的战术，因此他自然在那两个最坏的结局里面，选择一个最好的。这就是“最小最大”定理的命名的来源。乙也可以做同样分析，得出一个结果。问题是甲、乙双方在做了同样分析以后所得到的结果是否相同。“最小最大”定理的内容就是证明，在某种情况下，甲、乙所得的结果是相同的。
    现在我们可以看出飞机侦察潜水艇问题的复杂性了。飞机可以选择任意沿河道的地点侦察，也就是说，飞机有无穷多的战术可以采取。潜水艇也是如此。这样要进行分析和计算，就非常复杂了。在这一类的问题里面，许许多多都得要利用电子计算机去进行计算。因此找出简便的计算方法，就很重要了。
    通过上面的例子，我们可以看得出一些运用学的内容，以及它对国民经济和国防的实际意义。我们正在从事社会主义建设，发展科学研究。我们会遇到许多问题，例如产品系列化，铁路车站的分等，新的城市的规划，车站的设计和选择，交通系统间的联系，交通工具选择的原则等等。在这里，运用学的方法是有助于对问题的分析和解决的。
