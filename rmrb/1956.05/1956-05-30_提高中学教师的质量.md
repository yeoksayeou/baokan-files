    Improving the Quality of Secondary School Teachers
    In order to improve the quality of in-service teachers in secondary schools, Shanxi Province began correspondence and continuing education for secondary school teachers in 1956, striving to raise in-service secondary school teachers who have not reached the level of normal school graduates to the level of normal school graduates within three to five years. The two specialized correspondence courses in Chinese language and mathematics established in Shanxi Normal College in March have already had 1,588 secondary school teachers enrolled. At the same time, three secondary school teacher spare-time advancement schools were established in Datong, Yuncheng, and Linfen, with 150 students enrolled. Together with the original Taiyuan Municipal Secondary School Teacher Spare-time Advancement School, Shanxi Province now has four teacher spare-time advancement schools and one correspondence department, with more than 1,900 students enrolled, accounting for 85% of the total number of in-service teachers in the province's secondary schools and those who have graduated from normal schools.

    提高中学教师的质量
    为了提高中等学校在职教师的质量，山西省从1956年起开展了对中等学校教师的函授和业余进修教育，争取三年到五年把不及师范专科毕业程度的在职中学教师，提高到师范专科毕业程度。三月间在山西师范学院建立的函授部语文、数学两个专修班，已经有中等学校教师1，588人报名入学。同时期，在大同、运城、临汾三地，成立了三所中等学校教师业余进修学校，报名入学的有一百五十人。连同原太原市的中等学校教师业余进修学校，山西全省现在已经有四所教师业余进修学校和一个函授部，入学学员一千九百多人，占全省中等学校和师范专科毕业程度的在职教师总数的85％。　（石伯棠、白福祥）
