Running rural clubs thriftily according to the principle of diligence and thrift in managing cooperatives was a central topic at the Sichuan Province Rural Club Work Symposium held from May 21st to 27th.

Thirty-nine directors of agricultural production cooperative clubs from areas such as Guanxian and Suining exchanged experiences on this matter at the meeting.

The director of the Iron Bull Cooperative Club in Leshan County introduced at the meeting that in the nearly one year since its establishment, they have carried out various activities such as moonlight evenings, field mobilization, reading newspapers, broadcasting, and blackboard newspapers; the members themselves made musical instruments and other cultural and recreational supplies. The monthly evening party is also held under the moonlight to save lamp oil. In nearly a year, the club's total expenses have been less than 20 yuan.

The club directors at the meeting unanimously criticized the phenomenon of extravagance and waste in rural clubs, believing that it is necessary to make full use of existing equipment and conditions, give play to the wisdom of the masses, use local materials, and create and produce simple cultural tools and equipment to ensure that the most work is done with the least amount of money.

    办农村俱乐部要勤俭
    按照勤俭办社方针办好农村俱乐部，是从五月二十一日到二十七日举行的四川省农村俱乐部工作座谈会的一项中心议题。
    来自灌县、遂宁等地的三十九个农业生产合作社俱乐部的主任，在会上交流了这方面的经验。
    乐山县铁牛社俱乐部主任在会上介绍他们成立近一年中，开展了月光晚会、田间鼓动、读报、广播、黑板报等多种活动；社员们自己做了乐器和其他文娱用品。每月一次的晚会也在月光下举行，以节省灯油。在近一年时间里，这个俱乐部全部用费还不到二十元。
    俱乐部主任们在会上一致批判了农村俱乐部铺张浪费现象，认为必须尽量利用现有设备和条件，发挥群众智慧，就地取材，创造和制作简单的文化工具和设备，保证用最少的钱办最多的事。　（据新华社讯）
