A Great Event on the Roof of the World
　　——A Sketch of the Inaugural Meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region
　　By Our Correspondent Lin Gang
　　In front of the Potala Palace, on the People's Square, the newly built Lhasa Auditorium has now become a new historical landmark for the Tibetan people. On April 22nd (the 12th day of the third month of the Fire Monkey Year in the Tibetan calendar), the Dalai Lama announced the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region here. When Vice Premier Chen Yi presented the steel seal issued by the State Council to the Dalai Lama, the band played a solemn anthem, and the entire audience stood up, with applause rolling over the venue like spring thunder, lasting for a long time.
　　People will never forget this joyous sound, which conveyed the jubilant mood of the 1.2 million Tibetan people. Five years ago, the Tibetan ethnic group returned to the great family of the motherland. Since then, it has been advancing on the road of unity, progress, and development. The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region marks that the Tibetan people and the people of all ethnic groups in the country are closely and inseparably united. The work in the Tibet region has since entered a new stage.
　　On festivals or grand celebrations, the Tibetan people like to observe the weather. On this morning, the motherland's planes flew over Lhasa to congratulate the Tibetan people. Colored celebratory leaflets fluttered down from the sky, and tens of thousands of Tibetan men and women, thrilled with ecstasy, ran to the rooftops and squares, raising their arms to the sky and cheering for the planes sent by Chairman Mao for a long time. At noon, a rainbow appeared around the sun. Soon after, a light thunder brought a spring rain. The Tibetan people call thunder "the dragon's roar," and the first spring rain of each year is traditionally called "auspicious rain." The rainwater nourished the newly sown farmland, and the vast pastures will soon grow lush grass to treat the cattle and sheep. All these foreshadow prosperity for both humans and livestock, and a bountiful harvest. April 22nd, as an auspicious and festive day, will forever remain in the memory of the Tibetan people.
　　These days, newspapers, wired broadcasts, reports and speeches at the meeting, congratulatory messages at the meeting, and people's conversations are all repeatedly repeating these words: "The first time in history!" It is not that people's vocabulary is poor, but because only these words appropriately convey the significance of the events happening here.
　　The Tibetan people have a recorded history of about 1,300 years. It is the first time in history that Tibet is so united politically and religiously as it is today; the 57 representatives of fraternal ethnic groups, headed by Vice Premier Chen Yi, traveled thousands of miles to Lhasa to congratulate the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, demonstrating the unprecedented great unity between all ethnic groups in China and the Tibetan ethnic group, which is also the first time in history. It is the first time in history that the motherland's planes have appeared over the "Roof of the World" at an altitude of 5,000 meters, demonstrating that the Chinese people are fully capable of consolidating and defending the motherland's border, including the Tibetan Plateau. The high tide of patriotism displayed by the Tibetan people at this meeting is also unprecedented in history.
　　The delegates, carrying briefcases and wearing red ribbons on their chests, walked into the venue. They came from the uppermost reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, from the Qiangtang Plateau in northern Tibet, from the Himalayas, from the dense forests of Bomi, and from the banks of the Jinsha River. They came riding yaks, they came by cowhide boats, they came by car along the newly built roads, and they came from roads that were almost non-existent. Lhasa receives pilgrims every year, but it is also the first time in history that representatives from all regions, all aspects, all sects, and all social strata of Tibet have gathered together to discuss Tibet's major issues.
　　The Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni are closely and harmoniously jointly leading this meeting. A lama from the Shannan area said to me: "Since the two Living Buddhas returned from the interior, they have become even closer and more united. This matter is like seeing the sun for us Tibetan people!"
　　We entered the venue, and the harmonious and seamless atmosphere of the venue concentratedly and vividly reflected the unprecedented unity of the Tibetan ethnic group. The officials of the Kashag (Tibetan local government), with their hair braided into two strands and wrapped around the top of their heads, wearing gold "Gheu" on their hair buns, wearing fur-lined robes and red embroidered boots; the officials of the Panchen Kampus Assembly Hall, wearing yellow satin embroidered dragon jackets and round-topped gold-threaded hats; the Tibetan leaders of the Qamdo Area People's Liberation Committee, wearing Tibetan ethnic casual clothes, "Chuba" with wide sleeves and large collars woven with pulu. Almost all the main officials of these three parties attended this historic event. They were friendly and jointly consulted on the major issues of unifying Tibet and building Tibet. An atmosphere of mutual trust and mutual respect has replaced the long-term division and disunity of the past.
　　The divisions between the various sects of Lamaism were once used by imperialists and reactionary rulers to achieve their evil rule over the Tibetan people. Now, the various sects have also united. The leader of the Red Sect, Molin Awang Queza, the Sakya Dharma King Awang Tuqin Banba, and the Karmapa Hutuktu Chup噶玛巴·贝日多吉 all personally attended this meeting. Among the representatives of the various sects, some were participating in political activities for the first time, and some were coming to Lhasa for the first time.
　　The close cooperation between Communist Party members and Living Buddhas, Lamas, nobles, and monastic and secular officials has become a model of internal unity in Tibet. This cooperation is sincere and long-term, and the interests of the motherland and the Tibetan people are the foundation of this cooperation.
　　The members of the central delegation, wearing various ethnic costumes, sat in the right front of the venue. The representatives of the seventeen fraternal ethnic groups brought the hearts of all fraternal ethnic groups in the country. The Korean compatriots who live in the Changbai Mountains in the northeast of the motherland sent representatives who crossed the entire country, traveled 10,000 miles to come to this venue. The Tibetan compatriots learned for the first time that the motherland has a Buyi ethnic group. A girl from a remote rural area in Guizhou Province brought the sincere friendship of this ethnic group to the Tibetan people. Representatives of various parties, ethnic groups, and circles in the central delegation delivered congratulatory speeches at the meeting, like brothers talking about family matters. These congratulatory speeches were sincere, frank, and full of emotion. They unanimously congratulated the unity, progress, and further development of the Tibetan ethnic group.
　　The inaugural meeting lasted ten days. The grand meeting, held for the first time in Tibetan history, achieved complete success. The meeting not only reviewed the work since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, but more importantly, looked forward to the future. The prosperous and happy socialist prospect inspired every participant of the meeting. Everyone expressed that they would actively create conditions to strive for the early establishment of a unified Tibet Autonomous Region; everyone was saying that they would build their own beautiful hometown. The instructions put forward by the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni in their reports to carry out reforms in the Tibet region from top to bottom through peaceful consultation at an appropriate time were unanimously supported. More than a thousand representatives have a common and unshakable belief: under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, Tibet must catch up with the advanced fraternal ethnic groups and transition to a socialist society with them!
　　The news of the birth of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region spread faster than the wind across the grasslands, river valleys, and forests. Lhasa, Xigaze, Qamdo, Gyangze, Yadong, Zhamu, Tata area, Dingqing area, Shannan area... all held celebration meetings, and the Tibetan Plateau was immersed in revelry. In Lhasa, new scripture flags were put up around the golden roofs of the Potala Palace. The lamas of the famous three major monasteries—Drepung Monastery, Ganden Monastery, and Sera Monastery—were chanting scriptures and praying. Men and women put on new clothes, went to the Jokhang Temple to worship Buddha and gods, and lit pine smoke by the Lhasa River or on the surrounding mountains. All the famous Tibetan opera troupes and folk song and dance troupes in Tibet gathered in Lhasa to perform celebratory performances here. The Tibet Daily published a large number of congratulatory messages sent from all over the country every day, and the people of the whole country were congratulating the great event of the Tibetan people. People will never forget that only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China can the great cause of unifying Tibet be accomplished.

　　世界屋脊上的大喜事
　　——侧写西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会
    本报记者　林钢
    布达拉宫前，人民广场上，新建的拉萨大礼堂，如今成了西藏人民的新的历史纪念地。四月二十二日（藏历火猴年三月十二日），达赖喇嘛在这里宣告了西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立。当陈毅副总理将国务院颁发的钢印授给达赖喇嘛的时候，乐队奏起了庄严的颂歌，全场起立，掌声像春雷一样滚过会场，经久不息。
    人们永远不会忘记这欢乐的声音，它传达了一百二十万西藏人民欢欣鼓舞的心情。五年前西藏民族从新回到了祖国大家庭，从那时起，它一直在团结、进步和发展的道路上前进。西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，标志着西藏人民同国内各民族人民已经紧密地、永远不会分离地团结在一起。西藏地区的工作从此跨进了新的阶段。
    逢到节日或大典的日子，藏族人民爱看天气。这天早晨，祖国的飞机飞临拉萨上空向西藏人民道喜。天上飘飘落着彩色的庆祝传单，成千上万名被狂喜所激动的藏族男女，跑到屋顶平台上，跑到广场上，长久地向天空伸出手臂，向毛主席派来的飞机欢呼。中午时分，太阳周围出现了一圈彩虹。过后不久，一阵轻雷带来了一场春雨。藏族人民把打雷称为“龙向”，而每年的第一场春雨照例叫做“吉祥的雨”。那雨水滋润了刚刚播种的农田，千里牧场也将要长出丰茂的牧草来款待牛羊。所有这些，都预兆着人畜兴旺、收成丰稔。四月二十二日，作为一个吉祥和喜庆的日子，将永远留在西藏人民的记忆里。
    这些日子，报纸，有线广播，大会的报告和发言，大会上的祝词，人们的交谈，都在无数次地重复着这几个字：“历史上第一次！”不是人们的语汇贫乏，是因为只有这几个字是多么恰当地传达了这里正在发生的事件的意义。
    西藏人民有记载的历史大约有一千三百多年，西藏内部在政治上和宗教上像今天这样地团结一致，在历史上是第一次；以陈毅副总理为首的五十七位兄弟民族代表，跋涉千山万水来到拉萨，祝贺西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，表现了我国各民族和西藏民族的空前大团结，这在历史上也是第一次。祖国的飞机有史以来第一次出现在拔海五千公尺的“世界屋脊”的上空，它表明了我国人民完全有力量来巩固地保卫着包括康藏高原在内的祖国边疆。在这次会议上表现出来的西藏人民爱国主义热情高涨，在历史上也是空前未有的。
    代表们夹着文件袋，胸前挂着红条走进了会场。他们来自雅鲁藏布江的最上游，他们来自藏北的羌塘高原，他们来自喜马拉雅山，他们来自一片原始森林的波密地区，他们来自金沙江边。他们是骑着牦牛来的，他们是坐了牛皮船来的，他们是乘上汽车沿着新修的公路来的，他们是从几乎还没有道路的路上来的。拉萨每年接待着朝佛者，但是包括西藏各个地区、各个方面、各教派和各社会阶层的代表，荟萃一堂，共商西藏的大事，这在历史上也是第一次。
    达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼亲密和谐地共同领导着这次会议。来自山南地区的一位喇嘛对我说：“两位佛爷从内地回来以后，愈加亲密团结了。这件事，对于我们藏族人民来说，就像见到了太阳！”
    我们走进会场，会场上融洽无间的空气，集中而又生动地反映了西藏民族空前未有的团结。把头发分成两股辫子缠在头顶、发髻上戴着金质“格乌”、穿着滚绒大袍和红云绣靴的是噶厦（西藏地方政府）官员，身穿黄缎绣龙马褂、头戴圆顶金丝帽的是班禅堪布会议厅的官员；昌都地区人民解放委员会的藏族领导人穿的是西藏民族的便服，用氆氇织成的宽袖大领的“楚巴”。这三方面的主要官员几乎全体出席了这次历史盛会。他们友好地共同协商着统一西藏和建设西藏的大事。互相信任和互相尊重的空气已经代替了过去长期的分裂和互不团结。
    喇嘛教各教派的分歧，曾经被帝国主义和反动统治者利用来实现他们对西藏人民的罪恶统治。如今，各教派也团结起来了。红教领袖墨林·阿旺却札，萨迦法王阿旺土钦班巴，噶马教呼图克图楚普噶玛巴·贝日多吉都亲自出席了这次会议。在各教派的代表中，有的是第一次参加政治活动，有的是第一次来到拉萨。
    共产党员同活佛、喇嘛、贵族以及僧俗官员的亲密合作，成了西藏内部团结的模范。这种合作是真诚的，长期的，祖国和西藏人民的利益，是这种合作的基础。
    穿着各种民族服装的中央代表团团员，坐在会场的右前方，十七个兄弟民族的代表，带来了全国所有一切兄弟民族的心意。朝鲜族同胞聚居在祖国东北的长白山麓，他们派遣的代表是横穿整个祖国，走了一万里路来到这个会场的。西藏同胞第一次知道祖国有个布依民族，一位来自贵州省荒乡僻壤的姑娘，带来了这个民族对于西藏人民的真挚友谊。中央代表团内各党派、各民族和各界代表，在大会上致了祝词，像兄弟之间叙说家常一样。这些祝词诚挚、坦率、满含感情。他们同声祝贺西藏民族的团结、进步和更加发展。
    成立大会开了十天。西藏历史上第一次举行的盛会获得了圆满的成功，大会不仅回顾了西藏和平解放以来的工作，更重要的是瞻望了未来。繁荣幸福的社会主义远景鼓舞着会议的每一个参加者。大家都表示要积极创造条件争取早日成立统一的西藏自治区；大家都在说要建设自己美好的家乡。达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼在他们的报告里提出的，在适当时机通过和平协商方式、自上而下的在西藏地区进行改革的指示，得到了全体一致的拥护。一千多名代表，有着一个共同的不可动摇的信念：在中国共产党的领导下，西藏一定要赶上先进的兄弟民族，同他们一道过渡到社会主义社会！
    西藏自治区筹备委员会诞生的消息，比风还要快的传遍了草原、河谷和森林。拉萨、日喀则、昌都、江孜、亚东、扎木、塔塔地区、丁青地区、山南地区……都在举行庆祝大会，康藏高原沉浸在狂欢里。在拉萨，布达拉宫金顶的四周，换上了新的经旗。著名的三大寺——哲蚌寺、噶丹寺、色拉寺的喇嘛们在诵经祈祷。男人们和女人们穿起了新衣服，到大昭寺礼佛、敬神，到拉萨河边或到四周的山上燃起松烟。全西藏著名的藏剧团和民间歌舞团都齐集到拉萨，在这里作庆祝演出。西藏日报每天用很大的篇幅登载着各地拍来的贺电，全国人民都在祝贺西藏人民的大喜事。人们永远不会忘记，只有在中国共产党的领导下，才能完成统一西藏的大业。
