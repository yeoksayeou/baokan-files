    Hard-to-Wear Pretty Sock Liners
    The men's over-the-calf socks produced by the Beijing Local State-Owned Qinghe Hosiery Factory have attractive patterns, which are very appealing to customers. However, the ribbing at the top is too long, and the elasticity is too weak, making them difficult to pull up onto the foot. Many male comrades, after buying them, cannot wear them themselves, so they give them to their wives. Those who don't have wives, or even wives who cannot wear them, come to the department store for an exchange with much regret. These socks also shrink a lot after washing. The ones that were barely wearable before washing become too small to wear after washing. People hope that Qinghe Hosiery Factory will quickly find a way to make the men's over-the-calf socks not only pretty but also easy to wear.

    难穿的漂亮袜套
    北京地方国营清河制袜厂生产的罗口男袜套，花色漂亮，很吸引顾客，但是罗口太长，松紧力小，很难穿到脚上去。许多男同志买回去以后，自己穿不了，就给爱人穿。没爱人的或者连爱人也穿不了的，就很惋惜地来百货公司调换。这种袜套的缩水度也很大。洗水前勉强能穿的，洗水后就小得不能穿了。人们希望清河制袜厂赶快想法让罗口男袜套不仅漂亮，而且好穿。北京市百货公司第三门市部提货员
