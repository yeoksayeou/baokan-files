    To Defend Union Rights and Fight for Better Living Conditions
    American Workers Launch Broad Struggle
    Opposing the McClellan and Smith Bills
    Xinhua News Agency, May 25th, New York dispatch: The American ruling clique's activities to further restrict union rights are being strongly opposed by many American union organizations.
    Representatives of large American enterprises, fearing the development of the labor movement after the merger of the AFL and CIO, have recently submitted bills to Congress. Senator McClellan and Representative Smith have respectively introduced bills in the Senate and House of Representatives stipulating that state authorities have the right to undermine workers' strikes and to deprive unions of the "union shop system" (workers must join the union after being hired), etc.
    Many American unions are launching a movement to defend union rights. The "AFL-CIO" has called for a struggle against the McClellan and Smith bills.
    The Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, with more than one million members, the United Automobile Workers Union, construction industry unions, and electrical workers' unions have also issued statements protesting the American authorities' attempts to further restrict union rights.
    Demanding Higher Wages
    Xinhua News Agency, May 21st, New York dispatch: According to American newspapers, many American unions are currently launching a movement to demand higher wages.
    The Wage Policy Committee of the United Steelworkers of America, with more than one million members, held a meeting on May 15th and decided to submit demands for higher wages, increased unemployment benefits, and improved welfare benefits to 172 large steel companies and iron ore companies when the collective contracts expire at the end of June.
    The National Maritime Union, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, and the Switchmen's Union of North America have also recently demanded wage increases.
    The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union held a conference in Washington in early May, with more than 1,000 delegates attending. The conference called for expanding the scope of application of the minimum wage law.
    Opposing Unemployment and Mass Layoffs
    Xinhua News Agency, May 25th, Detroit dispatch: According to union newspapers, American auto workers are currently engaged in a struggle against unemployment. Due to employers' recent mass layoffs of workers in the face of poor auto sales, the number of unemployed auto workers has continued to increase to 160,000.
    The Executive Committee of the United Automobile Workers Union, with more than one million members, held a week-long meeting to specifically discuss the unemployment problem. The meeting decided to demand that the employers agree to hold labor-management meetings to solve the growing unemployment problem. The Third Regional Branch of the United Automobile Workers Union demanded that the federal government formulate public works projects to help the more than 100,000 unemployed workers in Detroit.

    为保卫工会权利和争取改善生活
    美国工人广泛展开斗争
    反对麦克利兰和史密斯法案
    据新华社25日讯　纽约消息：美国统治集团企图进一步限制工会权利的活动，正遭到美国许多工会组织的强烈反对。
    美国大企业的代表怀着对劳联和产联合并后工人运动开展的恐惧情绪，最近纷纷在国会提出法案。参议员麦克利兰和众议员史密斯分别在参众两院提出了法案，规定州当局有权破坏工人的罢工，有权剥夺工会所享有的“工会工厂制”（工人在被雇后必须参加工会）的权力等等。
    美国许多工会正在发动保卫工会权利的运动。“劳联—产联”已经号召开展反对麦克利兰和史密斯法案的斗争。
    拥有一百多万会员的铁路工人执行协会、联合汽车工人工会、建筑业的工会、电气工人的工会等等也先后发表声明，抗议美国当局进一步限制工会权利的企图。
    要求提高工资
    据新华社21日讯　纽约消息：据美国报刊报道，美国许多工会目前正在展开要求提高工资的运动。
    拥有一百多万会员的联合钢铁工人工会的工资政策委员会五月十五日举行了会议，决定在六月底集体合同期满时，向一百七十二个大炼钢公司和铁矿公司提出提高工资、增加失业津贴和改善福利待遇的要求。
    全国海员工会、混合成衣工人工会以及转辙工人和车站工人工会等，最近也要求增加工资。
    零售、批发、百货公司工人工会五月初在华盛顿举行了一个大会，有一千多名代表参加。大会要求扩大最低工资法的适用范围。
    反对失业和大批解雇
    据新华社25日讯　底特律消息：据工会报纸报道，美国汽车业工人目前正在展开反失业的斗争。由于雇主最近在汽车销路不佳的情况下大批解雇工人，汽车业的失业人数已经继续增加到十六万。
    拥有一百多万会员的联合汽车工人工会执行委员会举行了历时一个星期的会议，专门讨论失业问题。会议决定要求资方同意举行劳资会议，以解决失业日益增加的问题。联合汽车工人工会的第三地方分会要求联邦政府制定公共工程计划，帮助底特律的十多万失业工人。
