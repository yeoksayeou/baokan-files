Hebei Province's transportation, grain, supply and marketing, and other departments have recently formulated preliminary plans to encourage agricultural cooperatives to carry out transportation activities and support agricultural cooperatives and their members in engaging in sideline production such as processing oil extraction, making noodles, making tofu, making jelly, sprouting beans, and raising pigs. The implementation of this plan will bring an income of more than 31.2 million yuan to agricultural cooperatives and their members.

The above departments decided to take the following measures: appropriately expand the transportation network throughout the province; transportation departments and agricultural production cooperatives sign transportation contracts, and from May to December, the agricultural cooperative's transport carts will complete more than 133.8 million ton-kilometers of transport tasks; the Grain Bureau will allocate an additional 80 million jin of grain to focus on supporting members' sideline production such as making noodles and grinding tofu; in the second and third quarters, more than 15.5 million jin of oil crops will be entrusted to agricultural cooperatives for processing. In addition, supply and marketing cooperatives actively purchase and promote sideline products of agricultural cooperatives and their members.

The plan also actively encourages agricultural cooperatives and their members to develop pig raising. In addition to helping members buy piglets and appropriately solving the necessary feed, the fat pigs raised by agricultural cooperatives and their members can be freely disposed of by the cooperative and members after completing the state procurement tasks, ensuring that members have an adequate amount of meat consumption.

    河北运输等部门制定帮助农民发展副业生产的计划
    河北省运输、粮食、供销等部门，最近制定了带动农业合作社开展运输活动和支持农业社和社员从事加工榨油、制粉条、作豆腐、作凉粉、生豆芽、养猪等副业生产的初步计划。这个计划的实现将使农业社和社员获得三千一百二十多万元的收入。
    上述各部门决定采取以下措施：在全省范围内适当扩大运输网，运输部门和农业生产合作社签订运输合同，从五月到十二月，由农业社的运输大车完成一万三千三百八十多万吨公里的运输任务；由粮食厅增拨八千万斤粮食，有重点地扶持社员制粉、磨豆腐等副业生产；二、三季度将有一千五百五十多万斤的油料委托农业社加工。此外，供销社还积极收购和推销农业合作社和社员的副业产品。
    计划中还积极鼓励农业社和社员发展养猪业，除帮助社员买到小猪和适当解决必需的饲料外，农业社和社员所养的肥猪，在完成国家派购任务后，可由社和社员自由处理，保证社员有适量的肉食消费。
