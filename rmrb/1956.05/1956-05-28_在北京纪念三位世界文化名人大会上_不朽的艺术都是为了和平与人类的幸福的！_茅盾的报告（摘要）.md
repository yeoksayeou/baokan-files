At the Beijing Commemoration Meeting for Three World Cultural Celebrities
Immortal Art Is All For Peace and Human Happiness!
—Mao Dun’s Report (Abstract)
The literary brilliance and immortal achievements of the world literary giants—Kalidasa, the great ancient Indian poet, Heinrich Heine, the great 19th-century German poet, and Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky, the great Russian writer—are not only precious literary heritages of their respective homelands, but also precious spiritual wealth of all the people in the world. The Chinese people cherish the creative labors of these three masters as much as they cherish their own cultural heritage. For a long time, the Chinese people have seen their own love and hate, their own desires, their own ideals in the works of these three masters, and have strengthened their boundless confidence and perseverance in the struggle to win a bright future for mankind.

Kalidasa's life has not yet been definitively verified. There are various, greatly differing accounts of his period of life; most scholars believe that the era in which he lived was probably no earlier than the first century and no later than the fifth century.

The extant works of Kalidasa include four poems and three plays. Apart from two lyric poems (both “The Cycle of Seasons” and “The Cloud Messenger” have Chinese translations), all other works are based on ancient Indian legends, but Kalidasa only borrowed the shell of the stories in the legends and injected new blood into them. His works widely and vividly reflect the life of his era. The "gods," the "heroes," and "emperors" under his pen are full of human flavor; in his extremely diverse gallery of characters, there are not only kings, ministers, hermits, concubines, and female musicians, but also ordinary people of all walks of life, all of whom are flesh and blood, making us feel as if we had met them not long ago.

With beautiful imagination and deep feelings, Kalidasa sings the praises of the magnificent natural scenery of his motherland. His poems praising beautiful rivers and mountains have inspired people's love for their motherland; and this explains why this great ancient poet is not only loved by the Indian people to this day, but also by the people of the world.

Kalidasa's characters all love life and are prepared to fight to the end for their rights. The images of several women he shaped are rarely matched in the ancient literature of the world. Parvati (the heroine of the narrative poem "The Birth of Kumara") will never bow to fate; she has no scruples in order to achieve her wishes. If the poet lets us see in Shakuntala (the heroine of the play Shakuntala) a free and independent woman who is so gentle (unwilling to harm even small animals and plants) but also unusually brave, and although naive, resolutely refuses to be deceived, then, in Urvashi (the heroine of the play Urvashi), the poet has created another type; Urvashi is passionate, daring, and determined to fight to the end for her own purposes and rights. In the play "Malavika," he also created Iravati, who is very rebellious and even feared by the king, and speaks out for weak women who have been bullied. In contrast to these brave and pure women, some of the kings under Kalidasa's pen sometimes seem not very upright and respectable.

These ideas expressed in Kalidasa's works are the reason why this great poet of 1,500 years ago is immortal and loved by the Indian people and the people of the world; they are the reason why his works still stir people's hearts today and increase their courage and confidence in the struggle for truth and justice.

The cultural exchange between China and India has a long history. Twenty years ago, Kalidasa's works began to be translated into Chinese. Chinese translations of "Shakuntala," "The Cloud Messenger," and "The Cycle of Seasons" appeared successively, and this year we will also publish "Shakuntala" and "The Cloud Messenger," translated directly from Sanskrit, as well as other works by the poet. In this new era of "Asian awakening," the cultural exchange between China and India will have greater development in a new sense, and this will undoubtedly play a major role in enhancing the friendship between the people of our country and the people of India, and in promoting our common cause under the "Panchsheel" policy.

As early as half a century ago, the pioneers of our revolutionary literature, Lu Xun and Guo Moruo, were already admirers and introducers of Heinrich Heine. Our philosopher Ai Siqi was engaged in translating Heine's masterpiece "Germany: A Winter's Tale" in 1931. Heine is so respected by us: in their days of suffering, the Chinese people, with excited emotions, regarded this great poet who died a hundred years ago as a partner and spokesman in their struggle. And the path taken by the poet's fighting life—from a romanticist to a revolutionary democrat, and finally holding infinite confidence in the advent of socialism—for the progressive intellectuals of China in the 1920s and 1930s, was also their own path of arduous exploration. Just as Heine declared in 1830, the Chinese intellectuals of 1930 began to know: "What I want to do, what I should do, what I must do!"

Heine's life coincided with the turbulent era full of great historical events in the first half of the 19th century. His works reflect the complexity and contradictions of this era. In his youth, he witnessed the establishment and collapse of the Napoleonic Empire, he suffered the suffocating oppression of feudal reactionary rule, and he was saddened by the arrogance of the "Holy Alliance" and the disintegration of his motherland. However, the French "July Revolution" once inspired him; Marx's friendship helped him transform his world view. He developed from early romanticism to realism. In the history of world poetry, Heine's "The Silesian Weavers" is the first poem to point out that the working class is the gravedigger of the old order. As a representative of his later poems, "Germany: A Winter's Tale" foretells that "a new generation is growing," relentlessly criticizing the corrupt and barbaric old order with sharp strokes, and praising "the kingdom of heaven to be built on earth" with pure, fiery enthusiasm.

In 1831, intolerable to the reactionary ruling group of his own country, Heine had to flee to Paris. But even in Paris, his heart was always concerned with the suffering and liberation of the people of his motherland. During this period, the prose he wrote played a significant role in the cultural exchange between France and Germany and in the mutual understanding between the two peoples. Heine consciously took on the task of such a "bridge," and he completed this task very well. He criticized the German idealist philosophy (Kant, Fichte, Hegel), while also pointing out its positive side as a "preface to the next political change"; and when introducing the political and social life of France after the "July Revolution," he told his compatriots: The fruits of the "July Revolution" were seized by the bourgeoisie, who replaced the aristocracy with the same selfishness. "What the people got was only regret and greater disaster," but "once the bells of the storm ring again in the future, ... the people will fight for themselves and demand the reward they deserve!"

At that time, the divided state of Germany was what all the good people of Germany hated and were deeply saddened by. Heine, just like his older contemporary poet Goethe, longed for a democratic and unified Germany. In the long poem "Germany: A Winter's Tale," which is interwoven with strange poetic charm and revolutionary patriotism, Heine expressed his firm belief that the German people would eventually eliminate the evil forces that hinder liberation and unification and establish a truly unified Germany belonging to the people. This long poem still has its profound realistic significance today. We believe that the German people, wise and brave, will surely make the poet's call a hundred years ago a reality.

Hypocritical bourgeois scholars have spared no effort to slander and distort Heine. The fascists once tampered with, burned, and banned Heine's works. In today's West Germany, Heine is still frowned upon by rulers who violate the interests of the people. However, the people, the German people and the people of all countries, love Heine and respect Heine.

Heine has been away from us for a hundred years, and the "kingdom of heaven" he prayed and longed for has appeared on the earth. One-third of mankind is building a socialist, peaceful, and happy life with unparalleled enthusiasm. And the peaceful, democratic, and unified Germany that he struggled to achieve in his life will surely be realized soon!

Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky has long enjoyed a high reputation in China. At the beginning of this century, among the earliest batch of Russian classical literature translated into our country, there were Dostoevsky's short stories. After the "May Fourth" Movement in 1919, the Chinese youth's love for Russian literature formed a "craze"; more of Dostoevsky's works were translated. The first translation of "Poor Folk" was published in 1926, which started the long list of Chinese translations of Dostoevsky's long works. Up to now, Dostoevsky's important works (except "Demons") have all been translated, and several works have two or more translations.

In 1932, Lu Xun wrote "Congratulations on the Exchange of Chinese and Russian Characters." Recalling the initial spread of Russian literature to China at the beginning of this century, he said the following profound words:

"At that time, I knew that Russian literature was our teacher and friend. Because from it, I saw the kind soul, the bitterness, and the struggle of the oppressed; and I also ignited hope with the works of the 1840s and felt sad with the works of the 1860s. How could we not know that the Great Russian Empire was also invading China at that time, but from literature, we understood a major thing, that there are two kinds of people in the world: oppressors and the oppressed!"

Lu Xun's words incisively explained why Dostoevsky's works so profoundly stirred the hearts of Chinese readers; and explained why the word "insulted and injured" quickly became a new vocabulary of the youth at that time, not only to express grief, but also to express "it's impossible to live like this!"

Dostoevsky, the artist, showed in his works the tragic life of the Russian people under the Tsarist regime and the greed, meanness, and sin of the aristocratic landlords and capitalists. We saw ourselves who were insulted and injured in Dostoevsky's works. However, while Dostoevsky felt infinite pain for the insulted and injured people, he stubbornly refused to admit that there was any way to lead the people out of that tragic state of slavery, and even did not advocate seeking such a way. In a word, Dostoevsky's realism aroused our bitterness and anger, while Dostoevsky's reactionary "sermon" made us even more convinced: it is absolutely impossible to live like this!

Dostoevsky's life also provided a vivid example of being insulted and injured. He had the opportunity to follow the path of the Russian revolutionary democrats at that time. The publication of "Poor Folk" (when he was only twenty-five years old) showed his bright future. Belinsky and Nekrasov both gave "Poor Folk" a very high evaluation. But disaster followed. In April 1849, he was arrested, and in December of the same year, he was sentenced to death. Before the execution, it was announced that his death sentence would be replaced by exile to Siberia.

After ten years of unimaginable spiritual and social solitude, Dostoevsky, with deep spiritual and physical injuries, returned to St. Petersburg, but strongly felt the contradiction between himself and reality. In addition to the landlord and aristocratic regime that had tortured him in that way, insulted and harmed the people, what made him even more frightened was the "new demons" of capitalism. He was completely disappointed. And in order to get rid of that "new demon," he felt that the old order of aristocratic landlords was tolerable instead. As Leo Tolstoy said: Dostoevsky, who had once placed his hopes on utopian socialism, hated Fourierism for the rest of his life once his illusions were shattered. But what was especially bad was that he even hated the most progressive ideas of the time and stubbornly preached his sermon of relieving suffering from resignation.

Dostoevsky's works show the sad history of a great but insulted and injured to the point of being morbid soul. The works of this great artist reflect all the sharp class contradictions and erroneous ideas of the era in the latter half of the 19th century when the rule of the Russian aristocratic landlords was increasingly collapsing and capitalism was increasingly developing.

With great hatred and anger, he created a long line of nobles, landlords, and capitalists—all the characters of the exploiting classes who insulted and harmed people; his writing was so sharp, ruthless, and meticulous. With great bitterness and love, he created all the insulted and injured people who were suppressed at the bottom. He delicately depicted the mental illnesses of some people (which were the result of being insulted and injured), but more profoundly revealed the kind souls hidden within these illnesses. All of this will be cherished forever as a thrilling record of that era in the treasure house of world literature.

Kalidasa, Heine, and Dostoevsky, these three giants of world literature, reflected life from different angles and in different ways, and created immortal artistic images; their works expanded our understanding of life and enriched our spiritual world. Their contributions to human culture will be immortal in the history of human culture. Through them, mutual understanding and friendship among the people of all countries will be further enhanced, and this will surely contribute to the expansion and development of the cause of peace. All immortal art is for peace. Let us shout: Long live creative art, long live peace!

    在北京纪念三位世界文化名人大会上
    不朽的艺术都是为了和平与人类的幸福的！
    ——茅盾的报告（摘要）
    世界文学的巨人——印度古代的大诗人迦梨陀娑，十九世纪德国的大诗人海因里希·海涅，俄国的大作家费奥多·米哈伊洛维奇·陀思妥也夫斯基在文学上的光辉、不朽的成就，不但是他们各自的祖国的宝贵的文学遗产，也是全世界人民的宝贵的精神财富。中国人民像珍视自己的文化遗产那样，珍视这三位大师的创造性的劳绩。长时期来，中国人民从这三位大师的作品中看到了自己的爱憎，自己的愿望，自己的理想，并且加强了自己的为争取人类共同的光明前途而斗争的无限信心和毅力。
    迦梨陀娑的生平，还没有确实地考证出来。关于他的生活年代，就有各种不同的、差异很大的说法；多数学者认为他所生活的时代大约不会早于第一世纪，也不会迟于第五世纪。
    现在保存下来的迦梨陀娑的作品，有诗篇四，剧本三。除了两篇抒情诗（时令之环和云使皆有中译），其余作品全是取材于印度的古代传说，但是迦梨陀娑只是借用了传说中的故事的躯壳，而注入了新的血液。他的作品，广泛而生动地反映了他那个时代的生活。他笔下的“神”，传说的“英雄”“帝王”，十分富于人间味的；在他的极其多种多样的人物画廊中，不但有国王、大臣、隐士、妃嫔、女乐，也有各种职业的老百姓，都是有血有肉，使我们觉得好像不久以前我们曾经见过他们似的。
    迦梨陀娑以美妙的想像和深挚的感情，歌咏他的祖国的壮丽的自然物。他的那些歌咏美丽河山的诗章，激发了人们对于祖国的热爱；而这，也就说明了这位古代的伟大诗人为什么至今不但为印度人民所热爱，而且也为世界人民所热爱。
    迦梨陀娑的人物都是热爱生活，准备为自己的权利而斗争到底的。他所塑造的几个女性的形象，在世界的古代文学中是很少匹敌的。波罗婆蒂（叙事诗“鸠摩罗出世”的女主角）决不在命运面前低头，为了达到自己的愿望，她没有任何顾忌。如果诗人在沙恭达罗（沙茶达罗剧中的女主角）身上让我们看到一个虽然那样温柔（对于小动物和植物都不愿损伤它们）但又异常勇敢，虽然天真但又坚决不受欺骗的自由、独立的女性，那么，在斌儿娃希（斌儿娃希剧中的女主角）身上，诗人又塑造了另一个典型；斌儿娃希是热情的、敢作敢为的，为了自己的目的和权利是要斗争到底的。在“摩罗毗迦”剧本中，又创造了反抗性很强的、连国王都怕她几分的伊罗瓦蒂，为被欺的孱弱女子吐气。和这些勇敢而纯洁的女性相对照，迦梨陀娑笔下的一些国王有时显得并不是十分正直而可敬的。
    表现在迦梨陀娑作品中的这些思想，就是一千五百年前的这位大诗人之所以不朽，之所以为印度人民和世界人民所热爱；就是他的作品之所以在今天还激动着人们的心灵，增加了他们的为真理与正义而斗争的勇气和信心。
    中国和印度的文化交流是有悠久的历史的。二十年前，迦梨陀娑的作品开始译为汉文。“沙恭达罗”、“云使”、“时令之环”的汉译相继出现，今年我们还要出版直接从梵文翻译的“沙恭达罗”和“云使”以及诗人的其他作品。在这“亚洲觉醒”的新时代，中印的文化交流在新的意义上，将有更大的发展，而这，对于增进我国人民和印度人民的友谊，对于在“潘查希拉”的方针下推进我们的共同事业，无疑地必将起重大的作用。
    早在半个世纪以前，我国革命文学的先驱，鲁迅和郭沫若，都已经是海因里希·海涅的爱好者和介绍者。我们的哲学家艾思奇，在1931年就从事于海涅的杰作“德国——一个冬天的童话”的翻译。海涅是这样地受到我们的敬爱：中国人民在自己的苦难的日子里，怀着激动的情绪，把百年前逝世的这位大诗人，看作是自己斗争中的一个伙伴、一个发言人的。而诗人的战斗的一生所走过的道路——从一个浪漫主义者发展为革命的民主主义者，最后对于社会主义的到来抱着无限信心，——对于在二十年代到三十年代的中国的进步知识分子说来，也正是自己艰苦地摸索着的道路。正如同海涅在1830年所宣告，1930年的中国知识分子开始知道：“我要做什么，应该做什么，必须做什么！”
    海涅的一生，正当十九世纪前半期的充满了历史大事件的动乱的时代。他的作品反映了这一时代的复杂和矛盾。他在少年时期目击了拿破仑帝国的建立和崩溃，他身受着封建反动统治的窒息似的压迫，他痛心于“神圣同盟”的专横和祖国的分崩离析。然而，法兰西的“七月革命”曾经鼓舞了他；马克思对他的友谊，帮助了他的世界观的转变。他从早期的浪漫主义发展到现实主义。在世界诗歌的历史上，海涅的“西利西亚的纺织工人”是第一篇指出工人阶级是旧秩序的掘墓人的诗。作为他的后期诗歌的代表，“德国——一个冬天的童话”，则预告了“一个新的世代在生长”，以锋利的笔触无情地抨击那腐朽而蛮横的旧秩序，以纯洁的火一般的热情，歌颂了“要在地上建筑起那个天国。”
    1831年，为他自己祖国的反动统治集团所不容，海涅不得不亡命巴黎。可是他身在巴黎，他的心无时无刻不关怀着祖国人民的痛苦和解放。这一时期，他所写的散文，在法德的文化交流上，在两国人民的相互了解上，是起了重大的作用的。海涅是有意识在担当起这样的“桥梁”的任务，而他对这一任务也完成得非常出色。对德国的唯心主义哲学（康德、费希特、黑格尔），他既作批判，同时，也指出它的作为下一代“政治变革的导言”的积极的一面；而在介绍“七月革命”后法国的政治、社会生活的时候，他告诉他的祖国同胞：“七月革命”的果实，为资产阶级所攫夺，资产阶级以同样的自私自利代替了贵族。“人民得到的，只是悔恨和更大的灾难”，但是“将来一旦暴风雨的钟声再响起来，……人民就要为自己而战斗，要求应得的报酬！”
    当时德意志的分裂状态，是德意志的一切善良人民所疾首痛心的。海涅，正和他的同时代的老辈诗人歌德一样，渴望着一个民主的统一的德国。在那交织着奇瑰的诗意和革命爱国主义精神的长诗“德国——一个冬天的童话”中间，海涅表达了他对于德国人民的终于必将扫除那阻碍着解放和统一的恶势力而建立起一个真正属于人民的统一德国的坚强的信心。这一首长诗，在今天还有它的深湛的现实意义。我们相信，诗人在百年前的呼吁，智慧而勇敢的德意志人民必将使其成为事实。
    伪善的资产阶级学者曾经费尽心机地诬蔑和歪曲了海涅。法西斯曾经窜改、焚毁、禁止海涅的著作。在今天的西德，海涅还是被违反人民利益的统治者所侧目。然而，人民，德国人民和世界各国人民，是热爱海涅，是敬重海涅的。
    海涅离开我们已经百年，他所祈求渴望的“天国”已经在地球上出现，人类的三分之一正以无比的热情建设着社会主义的和平幸福的生活。而他一生所奋斗以求实现的和平、民主、统一的德国，也一定不久就能实现！
    费奥多·米哈伊洛维奇·陀思妥也夫斯基，长久以来就在中国享受着很高的声誉。本世纪初年，我国最早翻译的一批俄国古典文学中，就有陀思妥也夫斯基的短篇小说。1919年“五四”运动以后，我国青年对于俄罗斯文学的爱好，形成了“热潮”；陀思妥也夫斯基的作品，更多地被翻译过来。“穷人”的第一个译本出版于1926年，这就开始了陀思妥也夫斯基长篇作品的汉文译本的长串的名单。到现在，陀思妥也夫斯基的重要作品（除了“魔鬼”），都已翻译，若干作品有两种以上的译本。
    1932年鲁迅写了“祝中俄文字之交”。回忆到本世纪初年俄国文学最初传播到中国的情形，他说了如下的意义深长的话：
  “那时就知道了俄国文学是我们的导师和朋友。因为从那里面，看见了被压迫者的善良的灵魂、的辛酸、的挣扎；还和四十年代的作品一同烧起希望，和六十年代的作品一同感到悲哀。我们岂不知道那时的大俄罗斯帝国也正在侵略中国，然而，从文学里明白了一件大事，是世界上有两种人：压迫者和被压迫者！”
    鲁迅这几句话，也就一针见血地说明了陀思妥也夫斯基的作品何以那样深刻地激动了中国读者的心弦；说明了“被侮辱与被损害的”这词儿何以很快地成为那时候青年们的新的语汇，不但用以表示沉痛，也表示着“这样活不下去了！”
    艺术家的陀思妥也夫斯基在他的作品中展示了沙皇政权下俄国人民的悲惨生活以及贵族地主、资本家的贪婪、卑鄙与罪恶，我们在陀思妥也夫斯基的作品中看到了被侮辱、被损害的自己。但是，当陀思妥也夫斯基为了被侮辱与被损害的人民而感到无限痛心的同时，却又顽固地不承认有什么道路可以引导人民脱离那种悲惨奴役的境地，甚至不主张去寻求这样的道路。一句话，陀思妥也夫斯基的现实主义激起了我们的辛酸和愤怒，而陀思妥也夫斯基的反动的“说教”却使我们更加坚信：这样活下去是绝对不行的！
    陀思妥也夫斯基的一生，也提供了被侮辱与被损害的活生生的榜样。他有可能跟上那时候的俄国革命民主主义者的道路，“穷人”的出版，（那时他还只有二十五岁）展示了他的光明的前途，别林斯基和涅克拉索夫都给“穷人”以很高的评价。然而灾难也就跟着来了。1849年4月，他被逮捕，同年十二月，他被判死刑，在行刑前才宣布以充军到西伯利亚来代替他的死刑。
    经过了十年的难以想像的精神的和社会的孤独以后，陀思妥也夫斯基带着深重的精神和肉体的伤害，再回到彼得堡，却强烈地感到了自己和现实的矛盾。除了曾经那样子磨折他，侮辱和损害了人民的地主贵族政权而外，使他更加恐惧的却是资本主义的“新魔鬼”。他完全失望了。而为了要摆脱那“新魔鬼”，他反而觉得贵族地主的旧秩序倒是可以容忍的了。正如列夫·托尔斯泰所说：曾经对于空想的社会主义寄托了希望的陀思妥也夫斯基，一旦幻灭以后，就终生痛恨傅利叶主义。但尤其糟糕的，是他甚至仇恨那时代的最进步的思想，而执拗地宣扬他的从逆来顺受中解脱苦难的说教。
    陀思妥也夫斯基的作品表现了一个伟大的但是被侮辱与损害以至病态的灵魂的悲哀的历史。这位伟大艺术家的作品，反映了十九世纪后半期俄国贵族地主的统治日益崩溃而资本主义日益发展的时代的一切尖锐的阶级矛盾和错误思想。
    他以极大的憎恨和愤怒，创造了整个世代的一长列的贵族、地主、资本家——所有侮辱人，损害人的剥削阶级的人物形象；他的笔力是这样的尖锐、无情、剖析毫芒。他以极大的辛酸和热爱，创造了被压抑在下层的一切被侮辱与被损害的人们，他细腻的描绘了一些人们的精神上的病态，（那是被侮辱与被损害的结果）但更深刻地揭示了隐藏在这些病态之内的善良的灵魂。所有这一切，将作为世界文学宝库中的关于那个时代的惊心动魄的记录而永远被珍爱。
    迦梨陀娑、海涅、陀思妥也夫斯基，这三位世界文学的巨人，从不同的角度，以不同的方式，反映了生活，创造了不朽的艺术形象；他们的作品扩大了我们对于生活的认识，丰富了我们的精神世界。他们对于人类文化所做的贡献将在人类文化史上永垂不朽。通过他们，各国人民的互相了解和友谊将更加增进，而这，必将有助于和平事业的扩大和发展。一切不朽的艺术都是为了和平的，让我们高呼：创造性的艺术万岁，和平万岁！
