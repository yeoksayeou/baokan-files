Elementary school students run a "Young Pioneers Kiln Factory"
　　A "Young Pioneers Kiln Factory" has appeared in Nanhui Township Central Elementary School in Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province. The forty-five young workers engaged in the kiln factory are all sixth-grade elementary school students.
　　This factory is divided into five workshops: design, loading and unloading the kiln, making blanks, glazing, and firing the kiln. The factory director and workshop directors are the sixth-grade Young Pioneers squad leader and outstanding members. They also hired natural science teacher Zhu Zhenzhong as the engineer. During their spare time after class, the children make mud blanks and fire them every three or four weeks. Since the factory was established last December, it has been fired five times and has produced a batch of pottery toys and train models. The young workers have given all these products to the elementary school students in nearby elementary schools and the guests who came to visit. (Reported by Xinhua News Agency)

    小学生办的“少年窑厂”
    浙江省嘉兴县南汇乡中心小学里出现了一所“少年窑厂”。从事窑厂工作的四十五个小工人是六年级全班小学生。
    这个工厂分设计、装窑出窑、制坯、上釉、烧窑等五个车间，工厂的厂长和车间主任是六年级少年先锋队的中队长和优秀的队员担任的。他们还聘请了自然科教师朱振中为工程师。每到课余的时候，孩子们就动手做泥坯，每隔三、四星期烧一次。这个厂从去年十二月建立以来，已经烧过五窑，已生产了一批陶器玩具和火车头等模型。小工人们已把这些产品全都送给了附近各个小学的小学生和前来参观的来宾。　（据新华社讯）
