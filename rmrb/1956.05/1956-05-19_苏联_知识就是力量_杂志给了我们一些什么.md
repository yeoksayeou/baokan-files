What the Soviet "Knowledge is Power" Magazine Has Given Us
Xia Kangnong

The special issues of the Soviet "Knowledge is Power" magazine edited for Chinese young workers have been published for two issues. These two special issues are loved by the vast number of Chinese readers, and the number of copies issued falls short of demand. China's popularization of science and technology has gained a strong reinforcement and a valuable learning model from this.

In its thirty years of work, the Soviet "Knowledge is Power" magazine has successfully told readers about the process and brilliant achievements of the development of science and technology in the various stages of Soviet socialist construction, and stimulated young people's interest in studying science and technology. After the end of the Patriotic War, "Knowledge is Power" began to be published for students of Soviet worker technical schools and young workers.

Soviet young workers and students of worker technical schools like to read "Knowledge is Power" magazine very much. In their frequent spare-time scientific and technological research activities, they often get inspiration from this magazine, broaden their knowledge horizon, and gradually master the skills of creating inventions and putting forward rationalization proposals. Under the guidance of experienced teachers and engineers, they are able to manufacture various highly productive auxiliary tools, repair and improve machine tools and production equipment, manufacture intuitive teaching aids for professional classrooms and laboratories, and manufacture various simple agricultural machines and agricultural tools for collective farms and state farms. Many of the teaching aids in the teaching equipment of Beijing Experimental Worker Technical School were made and sent to our country by students from various Soviet technical schools during technical group activities and production internships. Another reason why the vast number of young workers and students of worker technical schools in the Soviet Union love "Knowledge is Power" magazine is that they have absorbed teaching materials for establishing a dialectical materialist worldview from it, and personally experienced how the continuous progress of production affects the continuous development of science, and how the constantly developing science in turn improves production, thus feeling more about the greatness, glory and loveliness of the working class and the socialist motherland in this respect.

The people of New China love "Knowledge is Power" magazine very much. In the past, the articles in it were often translated into Chinese and published in "China Youth," "Science Popularization" and other newspapers and periodicals, and were welcomed by a wide range of readers such as young workers, students of worker technical schools, general college and middle school students, young scientific workers, young engineering and technical personnel, and so on. In order to help workers and students of worker technical schools in our country to learn scientific and technological knowledge, the editorial department of the Soviet "Knowledge is Power" magazine proposed to specially edit five Chinese special issues for Chinese young workers. This kindness was welcomed by the Ministry of Labor of the People's Republic of China and the China Association for Science and Technology.

What will the "Knowledge is Power" Chinese special issue bring to Chinese youth? Judging only from the first and second issues of the special issue, it has the following advantages that are relatively lacking or weakly expressed in our current science and technology reading materials, and will bring great benefits to Chinese youth.

First, it attaches importance to the close integration of science and production. "Knowledge is Power" concretely and vividly illustrates that socialist production is endless in promoting the development of science and technology, and therefore producers' requirements for scientific and technological knowledge are also endless. At the same time, it further explains that the focus of the combination of science and production lies in the development of heavy industries such as metallurgy, fuel, and machine manufacturing, because this is the foundation of the socialist economic base that increases the people's material life.

Second, the special issue will help us understand how the Soviet people widely understand the latest achievements of Soviet science and technology and scientific activities. Such as the peaceful use of atomic energy and the application of semiconductors, as well as exploration activities in the North and South Poles.

Third, the special issue will help us intimately and deeply experience the role of people in labor creation. Through fascinating literary forms, the publication allows us to see how the Soviet working people are inspired by the socialist cause and the desire for scientific creation, how they overcome difficulties in various aspects, and achieved the victory of creative labor in science and technology.

Fourth, the special issue will help us understand how the progress of science and technology has improved people's daily life, such as television, helicopters, the wide application of ultrasonic waves, and even new facilities in sports venues. In addition, from the simplest machines, mechanical drawings and instructions, we can learn to make and equip various instruments and tools ourselves.

Fifth, the special issue will help us appreciate the inspirational significance of science fiction for scientific and technological research. Writers do not foresee the future in a strictly scientific sense, but adopt literary forms to express what they want to see in the future. The Soviet inventor who discovered the correct method of interstellar flight was precisely inspired by science fiction works.

Sixth, from the words of several features, we can appreciate the spirit of internationalism of the Soviet people's care and love for the Chinese people. These words either cherish the scientific value contained in the long-term production labor achievements of the Chinese people ("The Art of Harvest"), or praise the ancient Chinese culture and prosperity ("The Travels of Marco Polo"), or describe how the Soviet Party and government and scientists are painstakingly thinking about helping the Chinese people build a socialist society.

These advantages are embodied in a journal, and each article has its own content, but reveals mutual spiritual connections. What is especially worth learning is that the description of scientific and technological issues pays attention to the social and historical conditions that produce these problems, as well as their role in production practice and social practice, written with flesh and blood, inspiring readers' scientific thinking and cultivating readers' interest in scientific research from a perceptual perspective. Each article pays attention to the key issues in science and technology, narrating and developing around it, rather than a list of many principles, with no distinction between importance and insignificance. The beautiful artistic decoration and the accompaniment of many sketches all show the advanced example of this popular science magazine. No wonder the "Knowledge is Power" Chinese special issue is loved by the vast number of Chinese readers as soon as it is published. It will undoubtedly play a significant role in guiding Chinese readers' interest in scientific and technological research, expanding their horizons, and stimulating their enthusiasm for socialist construction. For our country, which is surging in a socialist upsurge today, the urgent need of the country and the people to strengthen and expand the publicity and education of science and technology, and how to be good at learning and applying the advanced experience of Soviet popular science writing to improve the quality of our work, is even more brought to the front of Chinese science and technology workers.

As for the Soviet "Knowledge is Power" magazine's experience in regularly organizing discussions on the educational effect of the magazine, helping and encouraging readers' amateur scientific research activities, and helping students of worker technical schools hold technical creation exhibitions, etc., it requires more extensive attention from relevant work units.

    苏联“知识就是力量”杂志给了我们一些什么
    夏康农
    苏联“知识就是力量”杂志的编辑部为中国青年工人编辑的专刊已经出版了两期。这两期专刊受到中国广大读者的喜爱，发行数量供不应求。中国科学技术的普及工作，从这里得到一支有力的援军和宝贵的学习榜样。
    苏联“知识就是力量”杂志在三十年来的工作中，成功地向读者讲述了苏联社会主义建设各个阶段中科学、技术发展的过程和光辉的成就，激发了青年人研究科学和技术的兴趣。卫国战争结束以后，“知识就是力量”开始为苏联工人技术学校的学生和青年工人出版。
    苏联青年工人和工人技术学校的学生都非常喜欢阅读“知识就是力量”杂志。在他们经常的业余科学技术研究活动中，常常从这份杂志里得到启发，扩大了知识的眼界，逐步地掌握创造发明和提出合理化建议的技能。他们在有经验的教师和工程师指导之下，能够制造各种具有高度生产率的辅助工具，修理和改进机床和生产设备，为专业教室和实验室制造直观教具，为集体农庄和国营农场制造各种简单的农业机器和农业工具。在北京实验工人技术学校的教学设备中，就有很多教具是苏联各种技术学校的学生在技术小组活动和生产实习的时候制成和送给我国的。苏联广大青年工人和工人技术学校的学生热爱“知识就是力量”杂志的另一个理由，是他们从这里面吸取了树立辩证唯物主义世界观的教材，切身体验到生产的不断进步怎样影响着科学的不断发展，而不断发展的科学又怎样转过来在提高生产，从而在这一方面更感到工人阶级和社会主义祖国的伟大、光荣和可爱。
    新中国的人民很喜爱“知识就是力量”杂志。过去，它里面的文章经常被译成中文，刊登在“中国青年”、“科学大众”和其他报刊上，受到青年工人、工人技术学校学生、一般大、中学生、青年科学工作人员、青年工程技术人员等等广大读者的欢迎。为了帮助我国工人和工人技术学校的学生学习科学技术知识，苏联“知识就是力量”杂志编辑部倡议特意为中国青年工人编辑五期中文专刊。这个盛意得到中华人民共和国劳动部和中华全国科学技术协会的欢迎。
    “知识就是力量”中文专刊将给中国青年带来什么呢？仅就专刊第一、第二两期来说，它具有我国目前科学技术读物中比较缺乏或者表现得比较薄弱的如下的优点，会给中国青年带来很大的益处。
    首先是重视科学和生产的密切结合。“知识就是力量”具体、生动地说明了社会主义的生产对于促进科学和技术的发展是无止境的，因此生产者对于科学和技术知识的要求也是无止境的。同时更说明了科学和生产结合的重点在冶金、燃料、机器制造等重工业的发展方面，因为这是使人民物质生活增长的社会主义经济基础的基础。
    第二、专刊将帮助我们认识苏联人民是如何广泛地理解苏联科学和技术的最新成就和科学活动的。如原子能的和平利用和半导体的应用以及南北极的勘探活动等。
    第三、专刊将帮助我们亲切而深入地体验到人在劳动创造中的作用。刊物透过引人入胜的文艺形式，使我们看到苏联劳动人民如何为社会主义事业和科学创造欲所鼓舞，如何克服各方面的困难，达到了科学技术的创造性劳动的胜利。
    第四，专刊将帮助我们认识科学技术的进步如何改善了人民的日常生活，如电视、如直升飞机、如超声波的广泛应用以至体育运动场的新设施等。此外从最简单的机器、机械的图样和说明中，可以帮助我们学会自己动手制造、装备各种仪器和工具。
    第五，专刊将帮助我们体会科学幻想对于科学技术研究的启发意义。作家并不是从严格的科学意义上预见将来，而是采用文艺的形式，抒写他想在将来看见什么东西。发现了星际飞行的正确方法的苏联发明家，正就是从科学幻想作品中得到启发的。
    第六，从好几篇特写的文字中，我们可以体会到苏联人民对中国人民关怀和爱护的国际主义精神。这些文字或者怀念中国人民长期生产劳动的成果中所包含的科学价值（“丰收的艺术”），或者表扬中国古代的文化和繁荣（“马可波罗游记”），或者叙述苏联党和政府、科学家怎样在费尽心血地想着帮助中国人民建设社会主义社会。
    这些优点体现在一个期刊中，各篇文字具有各自的内容，却又透露出相互的精神联系。尤其值得我们学习的，是叙述科学和技术的问题注意到产生这些问题的社会条件和历史条件，以及它们在生产实践和社会实践上所起的作用，写来有血有肉，从感性上启发读者的科学思考和培养读者对科学研究的兴趣。各篇文字都注意了科学和技术上的关键性问题，环绕它叙述、发展，而不是许多道理的罗列，轻重不分。美好的艺术装饰和许多小品文字的陪衬，都显出这个通俗科学杂志的先进榜样。无怪乎“知识就是力量”中文专刊一出版，就为中国广大读者所爱好。它对于中国读者科学技术研究兴趣的诱导，眼界的扩大和社会主义建设热忱的激发，无疑地都将起着显著的作用。对于我国在社会主义高潮澎湃的今天，国家和人民迫切需要加强和扩大科学技术的宣传和教育，如何善于学习和运用苏联通俗科学写作的先进经验，以提高我们的工作质量的问题，更是提到中国科学技术工作者的面前来了。
    至于苏联“知识就是力量”杂志在经常组织讨论杂志的教育效果，帮助和鼓励读者的业余科学研究活动，帮助工人技术学校的学生举办技术创作展览会等等方面的经验的学习，就需要更广泛的有关工作单位的注意了。
