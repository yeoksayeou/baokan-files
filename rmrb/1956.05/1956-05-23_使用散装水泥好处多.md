In the great socialist construction, the consumption of cement, the "grain" of construction projects, is growing rapidly. Our usual old method of transporting cement is to use strong and valuable industrial paper to make paper bags, package the cement into small bags of fifty kilograms each, and then send them out by truck and ship. This method is no longer entirely suitable for large-scale economic construction. For example, in 1956, we will use approximately 130 million paper bags for packaging cement. These paper bags require more than 33,000 tons of industrial paper to manufacture and require two to three thousand railway cars to transport the paper or paper bags. Each ton of cement requires paper bags worth eight yuan.

The Soviet Union uses bulk cement, which means loading directly from the cement factory warehouse into railway cars and unloading directly from the cars into mixing plants or construction site storage facilities. This method can save a lot of packaging costs and packaging materials. If half of our current cement volume is transported in bulk, we can save 26 million yuan in paper bag costs in construction projects each year, saving 15,000 tons of industrial paper and more than 1,000 freight cars in the entire national economy.

Using bulk cement can also improve the working conditions of transport and construction workers and increase labor efficiency. Until now, the loading, unloading, and transport of our bagged cement has been quite heavy. On large-scale construction sites or mixing plants, workers have to unpack large quantities of bagged cement and are often in a cloud of flying dust, which damages their health. Using bulk cement allows both loading and unloading to be done by compressed air. Loading and unloading cement with compressed air is almost one to two times faster than using manpower. This not only saves a large number of packaging, loading, and unloading workers but also saves freight cars. At the construction site or mixing plant, bulk cement goes directly from the storage facility into the mixer, and the cement does not fly around due to unpacking.

According to the practical experience of Fengman Hydropower Station using some bulk cement, bulk cement is also beneficial to ensure cement quality.

The use of bulk cement is relatively simple and feasible, and its scope of use is quite extensive. At present, on the construction sites of large factories or joint enterprises, there are centralized concrete mixing plants, and the use of bulk cement is the most economical. It is only necessary to build cement warehouses with a capacity of 2,000 or 4,000 tons and prepare several air pumps for unloading. The warehouses can be built with iron plates, and after the project is completed, these warehouses and conveying equipment can be moved to new construction sites. Large hydropower station construction projects, precast concrete component factories, cement product factories, and centralized large-scale civil construction sites can all use bulk cement.

To widely use bulk cement, the main thing is to strengthen the collaboration between the transportation, user, and supply departments. For example, the allocation of covered wagons, the metering of loading, and the construction of unloading equipment and warehouses at construction sites all need to be resolved in advance.

    使用散装水泥好处多
    建功
    在伟大的社会主义建设中，作为建筑工程的粮食——水泥的耗用量正在急速增长。我们习用的装运水泥的老办法是用结实而贵重的工业原纸制成纸袋，把水泥包装成每五十公斤的小包，再用车船送出去。这种办法已经不完全适合于大规模经济建设了。例如，1956年，我们用于包装水泥的纸袋将约为一亿三千万个，这些纸袋需要三万三千多吨工业原纸才能制成，要用两、三千个车皮来运纸或纸袋。每一吨水泥需要价值八元的纸袋。
    苏联采用散装水泥的办法，即从水泥工厂仓库直接装车，从车厢直接卸车到搅拌厂或工地储库的办法，可以节约大量的包装费和包装材料。假使我国现在水泥量的一半采用散装的办法，每年在建筑工程中，就可以节约二千六百万元的纸袋费，在整个国民经济中节省出一万五千吨工业原纸和一千多个运货车厢来。
    使用散装水泥还能改善运搬工人和建筑工人的劳动条件，提高劳动效率。直到现在，我们袋装水泥的装卸运搬工作还是颇为笨重的。在大规模的建筑工地或搅拌厂，工人们要大量拆用袋装水泥，常常处于飞扬弥漫的粉尘中，他们的健康受到粉尘的损害。采用散装水泥，就能使卸车和装车工作都由压缩空气来进行。用压缩空气装卸水泥比用人工，几乎要快一倍到二倍。这就不仅可以节省大量包装、装车、卸车工人；而且可以节省运货车皮。在工地或搅拌厂，散装水泥直接从储库进入搅拌机，水泥也不致因拆袋而飞扬弥漫了。
    根据丰满水电站使用部分散装水泥的实际经验证明，散装水泥对保证水泥质量也有好处。
    散装水泥的使用比较简易可行，其使用范围也颇为广泛。目前，在大型工厂或联合企业的建设工地上，设有集中的混凝土搅拌厂，使用散装水泥最为经济。只须建设二千或四千吨容量的水泥仓库和备置若干卸车的空气泵就可以了。仓库可用铁板建成，当工程竣工后，这种仓库和输送设备都可以搬到新的工地。大型水电站建设工程，预制混凝土构件厂，水泥制品厂，集中的大量民用建筑工地都可利用散装水泥。
      要广泛使用散装水泥，主要的就是加强运输部门、使用部门和供应部门的协作，如：棚车的调配问题，装车的计量问题，工地卸车设备和仓库的建设问题等，都需要事先解决。
