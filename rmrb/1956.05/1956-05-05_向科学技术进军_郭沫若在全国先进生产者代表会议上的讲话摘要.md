　　Marching Towards Science and Technology
　　Excerpts from Guo Moruo's Speech at the National Conference of Advanced Producers' Representatives

Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, delivered a speech entitled "Marching Towards Science and Technology" at the National Conference of Advanced Producers' Representatives on the 4th. Guo Moruo said that today we have the full conditions to bring China's backward level of science and technology close to the advanced level of the world within twelve years; we are able to victoriously complete this task.

Guo Moruo said: If we have appropriate long-term plans, practical and feasible specific measures, the possibility of training sufficient cadres, and reasonably thorough scientific intelligence, then we will certainly be able to bring China's backward science and culture close to the advanced level of the world within twelve years.

In his speech, Guo Moruo explained the specific work currently being carried out by Chinese scientists. He said that under the leadership of the Party and the government, Chinese scientists are currently concentrating their efforts on formulating a twelve-year long-term plan. This plan will point out the most important tasks that national construction and the national economy expect from science and technology in the next twelve years, and stipulate what specific measures should be taken to promote the research work of those central issues that must be researched.

Guo Moruo said that since the end of last year, we have concentrated China's outstanding scientists to conduct discussions. We lack experience in formulating plans, and Soviet experts in China have given us great help. In addition, the Soviet government has also specially dispatched more than a dozen experts working on the front lines of scientific research in the Soviet Union to specifically help us. In March of this year, a Science Planning Committee has been established under the State Council to be responsible for guiding this work. It is expected that the draft of the twelve-year science development long-term plan can be completed soon. Once this draft plan is approved by the government, specific measures will be carried out in accordance with the plan. In terms of specific measures, we must make full and careful considerations. We must make scientific research have sufficient material conditions: research institutions, instruments and equipment, books and materials, and personnel allocation, should be as complete as possible. In particular, it is necessary to arrange according to the existing achievements of world science, that is to say, to strive to catch up at the level already reached by the Soviet Union and other brotherly countries, instead of starting from scratch.

In his speech, Guo Moruo also specifically talked about two important issues, namely, having sufficient cadres and strengthening scientific intelligence work. He said that we must use our greatest strength to cultivate a large number of new forces. This is the central task of the Higher Education Department and the Education Department, and it should also be the central task of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the research institutions of various industrial and cultural departments. If we want to quickly catch up with the world's advanced level within a certain period of time, this requires us to do a good job in scientific intelligence work. We must learn all science and technology that is beneficial to our national construction. We must not only learn from the Soviet Union and the people's democratic brotherly countries, but also from scientists in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. Scientific and technological research in capitalist countries is also constantly progressing, and we cannot ignore it in the slightest. Today, we should never adopt a closed-door policy and restrict ourselves to a small circle.

In his speech on how to develop my country's science and technology, Guo Moruo gave a more detailed introduction to the latest achievements in world science and technology in recent years. Guo Moruo said that the rapid development of the country's socialist industrialization and socialist transformation will inevitably result in an increase in the need for science and technology and scientific and technological personnel. In the past six years or more, our science and technology has made significant progress, but from the perspective of the development of the entire national construction cause, the development of science and technology is far behind the needs of national construction and the national economy. Compared with the international advanced level of world science, we are even further behind. Such a situation cannot be allowed to continue.

Guo Moruo pointed out: We Chinese people have scientific minds. The three major inventions that promoted modern world civilization—the compass, gunpowder, and movable type printing—are all the crystallization of the wisdom of our previous generations of working people. The famous pi states that if the diameter is one inch, the circumference is more than three inches. But how much more is it? In Europe, the German Valentin Otto calculated to seven decimal places in 1573 AD. But in our country, Zu Chongzhi of the Northern Qi Dynasty (429 AD—500 AD) had already accurately obtained this result in the fifth century AD. This is more than a thousand years earlier than Valentin Otto. Guo Moruo said that today, Chinese scientists must make the greatest efforts to avoid being ashamed of our ancestors.

Guo Moruo said that we have the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the great selfless assistance and creative cooperation of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, the massive needs of national construction and the urgent demands of the people of the whole country, and many advanced producers and advanced workers playing a leading role as our models; therefore, the vast majority of our scientists have strong confidence and will definitely be able to complete the glorious and arduous task of bringing China's science and technology level close to the world's advanced level within twelve years.

### 向科学技术进军  郭沫若在全国先进生产者代表会议上的讲话摘要

　　向科学技术进军
　　郭沫若在全国先进生产者代表会议上的讲话摘要
    中国科学院院长郭沫若四日以“向科学技术进军”为题，在全国先进生产者代表会议上讲了话。郭沫若说，要在十二年之内使中国落后的科学技术水平接近世界的先进水平，今天已经有了充分的条件；我们能够胜利地完成这项任务。
    郭沫若说：我们如果有了妥当的远景规划，有了切实可行的具体措施，有了培养足够干部的可能性，有了相当周密的科学情报，那就一定能够在十二年之内使中国落后的科学文化接近世界先进水平。
    郭沫若在讲话中，说明了中国科学家们目前正在进行的具体工作。他说，中国科学家们在党和政府的领导下，目前正在集中力量从事十二年远景规划的制订。这个规划将要提示出在今后十二年里国家建设和国民经济所期待于科学技术的最重要的任务，并且规定出应该采取怎样的具体措施，来促进那些非研究不可的中心问题的研究工作。
    郭沫若说，从去年年末以来，我们就把中国优秀的科学家们集中起来进行讨论。我们在制订规划上是缺乏经验的，在中国的苏联专家给了我们很大的帮助。此外，苏联政府还特别派遣了十几位在苏联科学研究第一线上工作的专家，来专门帮助我们。今年三月间，在国务院下已经成立了一个科学规划委员会来负责指导这项工作。预计不久以后，十二年科学发展远景规划的草案便可以完成。这个规划草案一经政府批准，就要按照规划进行具体措施。在具体措施上，我们是要作充分仔细地考虑的。我们要使科学研究具有充分的物质条件：研究机构，仪器设备，图书资料，人员配备，要尽可能地应有尽有。特别是要根据世界科学已有的成就来安排，那就是说要在苏联和其他兄弟国家已经达到的水平上，努力赶上，而不是从头做起。
    郭沫若在讲话中，还特别谈到了两个重要问题，即要有足够的干部和加强科学情报工作的问题。他说，我们必须用最大的力量来培养大量的新生力量。这是高等教育部和教育部的中心任务，同时也应该是中国科学院和各产业部门、文化部门研究机构的中心任务。我们要在一定时期内迅速赶上世界先进水平，这就要求我们必须把科学情报工作做好。凡是于我们国家建设有益的科学技术，我们都是必须学习的。我们不仅要向苏联和人民民主兄弟国家学习，也要向亚洲、非洲、欧洲、美洲各国的科学家们学习。资本主义国家的科学技术研究也在经常不断地进展，我们是丝毫也不能忽视的。在今天我们是决不应该采取闭关主义，把自己限制在一个小圈子里面去。
    郭沫若在他的如何发展我国科学技术的讲话中，比较详细地介绍了最近年代世界科学技术的最新成就。郭沫若说，国家的社会主义工业化和社会主义改造事业的迅速发展，必然的结果是增加对于科学技术和科学技术人员的需要。过去的六年多来，我们的科学技术是有显著的发展的，但从整个国家建设事业的发展说来，科学技术的发展是远远地落后于国家建设和国民经济的需要的。如果和世界科学的国际先进水平比较起来，我们更是远远落后。这样的情况是不能允许继续存在的。
    郭沫若指出：我们中国人民是具有科学头脑的。促进世界近代文明的三大发明——指南针、火药、活字印刷术，都是我们前代劳动人民智慧的结晶。有名的圆周率规定直径一寸，圆周就有三寸多。可是究竟多多少呢？在欧洲是日耳曼人的瓦仑丁·奥妥在公元1573年算到了小数点下七位数。但在我国，北齐的祖冲之（公元429年—500年）在纪元五世纪便已经准确地得到了这样的结果。这比瓦仑丁·奥妥要早一千多年。郭沫若说，今天中国的科学家们一定要作最大的努力，以求对于我们的祖先没有愧色。
    郭沫若说，我们有党中央的正确领导，有苏联和人民民主国家的伟大无私的帮助和创造性的合作，有国家建设上的大量需要和全国人民的迫切要求，还有许多先进生产者和先进工作者起带头作用，作为我们的模范；因此，我们绝大多数科学家都有着坚强的信心，一定能够完成在十二年内使中国的科学技术水平接近世界先进水平的光荣而艰巨的任务。
