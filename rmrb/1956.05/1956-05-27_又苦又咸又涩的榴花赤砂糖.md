    Bitter, Salty, and Astringent Pomegranate Flower Brown Sugar
    Editor:
    The Pomegranate Flower brown sugar produced by some sugar factories under the Guangdong Provincial Sugar Industry Company is of very poor quality. According to the Shanghai Department Store's Wholesale Food Store, the 588 packages of Pomegranate Flower brown sugar shipped from Guangdong's Shunde Sugar Factory on February 19th had a stiff sugar quality, many impurities, and tasted bitter, salty, and astringent. The Handan Wholesale Station of the Hebei Provincial Department Store, the Zhejiang Provincial Department Store, and the Shijiazhuang Purchasing Station of the China Department Store also reported similar issues. After inspection by the Guangdong Sugar Company, the situations reflected by the commercial departments in various regions were completely consistent with the facts. However, the Sugar Industry Company did not accept these opinions to improve product quality.
    The sugar factories under the Guangdong Provincial Sugar Industry Company all have new mechanized equipment and product inspection agencies, and the quality of the sugarcane used for sugar production is also very good. But why are they producing these substandard sugars? I hope that the relevant leading authorities will inspect the production situation of the factories under the Guangdong Provincial Sugar Industry Company and help them improve their work.
            Guangdong Sugar Company, Zhao Jialin

    又苦又咸又涩的榴花赤砂糖
    编辑同志：
    广东省制糖工业公司所属某些糖厂生产的榴花赤砂糖质量很坏。据上海市百货公司机制食品批发商店反映：二月十九日从广东运去的顺德糖厂出产的588包榴花赤砂糖糖质发僵，杂质多，味道又苦又咸又涩。河北省百货公司邯郸批发站、浙江省百货公司、中国百货公司石家庄采购站等单位也有类似反映。经广东省糖业公司检查，各地商业部门反映的情况是完全符合事实的。但是制糖工业公司并没有接受这些意见来提高产品质量。
    广东省制糖工业公司所属糖厂都有新型机械化的设备和产品检验机构，制糖的原料甘蔗质量也很好，但是为什么出产这些不合乎规格的糖呢？我希望有关领导机关检查广东省制糖工业公司所属各厂的生产情况，并且帮助他们改进工作。
