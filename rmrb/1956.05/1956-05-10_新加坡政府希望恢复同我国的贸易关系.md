Xinhua News Agency, London, May 9th: Singapore's Chief Minister, Marshall, said on May 8th, "My government urgently hopes to restore trade relations with China."

Marshall said at a banquet hosted by the English-Jewish Association in London: "Trade is the foundation of our life, the foundation on which we depend for survival. We believe that this artificial restriction of normal trade, which benefits our competitors and only harms Malaya, is very dangerous for our future."

In his speech, Marshall believed that Singapore should remain a free port and an open market, and he also expressed doubts about Singapore's military value. He said: "Based on recent experience, it is doubtful whether Singapore, this so-called fortress, is in fact of such great significance to the free world that the attitude of some people in Britain who believe that Singapore should continue to be a colony no matter what in order to protect the interests of the Commonwealth is also correct."

Marshall is leading a Singapore delegation in London negotiating Singapore's future political status with Britain. This negotiation is currently in a difficult situation regarding the control of internal security. Britain's reason for not giving up control of Singapore's internal security after Singapore's independence is that Singapore is a "fortress in the defense system" of Western countries.

　　新加坡政府希望恢复同我国的贸易关系
    新华社9日讯  伦敦消息：新加坡首席部长马歇尔五月八日说：“我的政府迫切希望恢复同中国的贸易关系。”
    马歇尔在伦敦英犹协会的宴会上讲话说：“贸易是我们生活的基础，是我们赖以生存的基础，我们认为，这种有利于我们的竞争者而仅仅使马来亚受损害的人为的正常贸易的限制，对于我们的前途是很危险的。”
    马歇尔在讲话中认为新加坡应当保持为一个自由港和开放的市场，他并且对新加坡的军事价值表示怀疑。他说：“根据最近的经验可以怀疑，事实上，新加坡这个所谓堡垒对自由世界说来是否有如此重大的意义，以致英国的某些人认为新加坡无论怎么样都应当继续成为一个殖民地以便保护英联邦的利益的态度也是对的了。”
    马歇尔正率领新加坡代表团在伦敦和英国谈判新加坡的未来政治地位。这个谈判目前在内部安全的控制权问题上陷于困难境地。英国不愿意在新加坡独立后放弃对新加坡内部安全的控制的理由是：新加坡是西方国家“防御体系中的一个堡垒”。
