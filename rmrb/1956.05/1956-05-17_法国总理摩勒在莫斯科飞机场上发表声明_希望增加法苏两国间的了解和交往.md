Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th. French Premier Mollet, Foreign Minister Pineau, and their entourage, who were invited to visit the Soviet Union, arrived in Moscow by plane on the 15th, accompanied by the Soviet Ambassador to France, Vinogradov.

Greeting them at the airport were: Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, First Deputy Chairmen of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Kaganovich, Molotov, Pervukhin, and other responsible personnel of the Soviet Government, as well as the French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Dejean, and diplomatic envoys from other countries stationed in the Soviet Union.

At the airport, Premier Mollet issued a statement regarding their visit.

Mollet said that throughout their history, the people of France and the Soviet Union have always been connected by sincere friendship, the basis of which is mutual sympathy and cultural and economic ties. During the Second World War, the heroism of the Soviet army and their contribution to the final victory strengthened this feeling. When recalling this page of war history, the hearts of our two peoples resonate with each other.

During our stay in Moscow and visits to other regions of the Soviet Union, we will have the opportunity to see the daily lives of Soviet citizens and understand their worries and hopes. International relations should be based on such concrete facts, rather than on theoretical conclusions, and the abuse of theoretical conclusions is often harmful. We will have multiple talks with representatives of the Soviet government. Our hope is to compare our shared views with each other in order to understand to what extent the basis of these views is reliable. Direct contact and talks are the first condition for mutual understanding.

I also hope that our visit will help develop exchanges between our two countries in all aspects.

Both of our countries are concerned with the rapid resolution of many international issues, such as the European issue, the Middle East issue, and the issue of universal disarmament. We will discuss all these issues with the Soviet government.

Mollet said that France is associated with many treaties, and France is a member of many groups, and it still willingly remains faithful to these groups. This wish is combined with a constant and persistent commitment to the peaceful resolution of all disputes in the world. We believe that international tensions will continue to ease. However, the easing of tensions should not only be verbal, but should also be reflected in practice. The easing of tensions does not mean, nor can it mean, maintaining the status quo. It should take the concrete form of practical results achieved through negotiations. (Attached picture)

    法国总理摩勒在莫斯科飞机场上发表声明
    希望增加法苏两国间的了解和交往
    新华社莫斯科16日电　应邀访问苏联的法国总理摩勒、外交部长比诺和他们的随行人员，在苏联驻法国大使维诺格拉多夫陪同下，在十五日搭飞机到达莫斯科。
    到飞机场欢迎他们的有：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁，苏联部长会议第一副主席卡冈诺维奇、莫洛托夫、别尔乌辛和苏联政府的其他负责人员，以及法国驻苏联大使德让和其他国家驻苏联的外交使节。
    在飞机场上，摩勒总理就他们的这次访问发表了声明。
    摩勒说，法苏两国人民在他们的整个历史上始终由真挚的友谊连结在一起，这种友谊的基础就是互相的同情以及文化和经济上的联系。在第二次世界大战期间，苏联军队的英雄主义精神、他们对最后胜利作出的贡献都加强了这种感情。在回忆起这一页战史的时候，我们两国人民的心是相互呼应的。
    我们在莫斯科逗留和在苏联其他地区访问的时候，我们将有机会看到苏联公民的日常生活，了解他们的忧虑和希望。国际关系正应该是建立在这种具体事实的基础上，而不应该建立在理论性的结论的基础上，而滥用理论性的结论往往是有害的。我们将同苏联政府的代表作多次的会谈。我们的希望是把我们共有的观点互相比较，以便互相了解这些观点的根据可靠到何种程度。直接的接触和会谈是相互了解的第一个条件。
    我还希望，我们的这次访问会帮助发展我们两国一切方面的交往。
    我们两国都关心于迅速解决许多国际问题，如欧洲问题、中近东问题、普遍裁军问题。对这一切问题我们都要同苏联政府交谈。
    摩勒说，法国是和许多条约有关联的，法国是许多团体的成员，而它仍旧愿意忠实于这些团体。这种愿望是同经常地、坚持地致力于和平解决世界上的一切争端的愿望结合在一起的。我们相信，国际紧张局势还会继续缓和下去。但是，应该不仅是口头上要缓和紧张局势，而且要在实际中表现出来。紧张局势的缓和并不意味着，也不可能意味着保持现状。它应该采取由谈判而达成的实际结果的具体形式。（附图片）
