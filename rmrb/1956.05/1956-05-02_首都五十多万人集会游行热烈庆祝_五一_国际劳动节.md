Xinhua News Agency, May 1st: Today, the people of the capital, holding high flags, flowers, and shouting slogans, grandly marched through Tiananmen Square to warmly celebrate "May Day" International Labor Day. Over six thousand national advanced producers' representatives walked at the front of the parade. More than 500,000 people participated in today's parade.

Party and government leaders Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and other leaders reviewed the parade from Tiananmen.

Before the start of the parade, Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen delivered the opening speech at the celebration meeting. He extended warm holiday greetings to all those present.

Paraders used numerous charts and models to demonstrate the great achievements made in socialist construction and socialist transformation, and expressed their determination to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and with overfulfilled targets. The procession was filled with a vibrant atmosphere of production, construction, and peace.

The more than six thousand national advanced producers' representatives were warmly welcomed by the audience. In their work, they created thousands of advanced experiences to accelerate the socialist construction of the motherland.

Workers from the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, Beijing People's Machine Factory, and Beijing Tire Retreading Factory, which had already completed the first Five-Year Plan targets before the holiday, all participated in the parade. Today, workers from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant pushed a model of a blast furnace in the parade. The young hot blast furnace workers of this factory achieved a wind temperature of 1,000 degrees Celsius in late April, setting a national record. A chart showed that the factory's employees guaranteed to complete the five-year plan's total output value target one year and four months ahead of schedule. The "Youth Shock Brigade" flags and "Advanced Collective" red banners fluttered in the construction workers' ranks. Since the beginning of this year, the Youth Shock Brigade members have exceeded the state quotas every month. Due to the continuous overcoming of right-leaning conservative tendencies, construction workers have built more than 14 million square meters of buildings in Beijing in the past few years, which is equivalent to more than 70% of the total area of houses in Beijing before liberation.

More than 10,000 farmers from the suburbs of Beijing, who have realized complete socialist agricultural cooperativization, participated in the parade during the busy farming season. They carried models and charts of crops, indicating that the entire rural area in the suburbs of the capital is in a production upsurge. In the parade, members of agricultural production cooperatives such as China-Soviet Friendship, China-Czechoslovakia Friendship, and Peace, who created high-yield records last year, held up the award flags they received, and their planned grain crop yield this year is much higher than last year. This spring, farmers in the suburbs of Beijing universally implemented production operating procedures and completed spring sowing ten days ahead of schedule.

Among the parade of 20,000 members of handicraft production cooperatives, there were old artists of ivory carving, jade carving, cloisonné, etc., as well as hundreds of newly selected advanced producers, who led all members to produce one and a half times more products in the first quarter than in the same period last year.

Today, industrialists and businessmen participated in the "May Day" celebration for the first time as employees of joint state-private enterprises. Many industrialists, businessmen, and their families participated in the parade together. Large banners expressed the determination of industrialists and businessmen in Beijing to further complete socialist transformation.

Scientific workers participating in the parade were warmly welcomed, with the banner and words "March towards Science" raised high in their ranks. In the ranks of 140,000 teachers, students, and staff of universities and middle schools, many charts and models showed that China's scientific reserve force is growing rapidly, and more than 30,000 university and middle school students in Beijing have participated in various scientific research groups.

Government staff and people from all walks of life also participated in the parade. Many people wore new clothes today, making the parade even more colorful.

The paraders warmly expressed their wishes for international peace and friendship. Young Pioneers released hundreds of white peace doves in the square, and five hundred female workers from the Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory used bouquets of various colors to form the four large characters "Long Live Peace." Many slogans were written on the banners held high in the crowd and on the balloons released: "Long live Marxism-Leninism!" "Long live the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!" "Support the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence!" "Strive for the further easing of international tensions!" "Long live the friendship between Asian and African countries!" "Long live the great unity of the people of the world!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

The paraders waved bouquets to salute the foreign guests. Among the foreign guests were diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries to China, delegations and representatives from more than fifty countries, as well as experts from the Soviet Union, various people's democratic countries, and other countries who are helping China's construction.

The eye-catching literary and artistic contingent consisted of more than 6,000 people, including literary and art workers from Beijing, some drama workers from other places who came to Beijing to perform, and amateur cultural activists from the masses. The actors performed dances such as the flower-basket dance, the land boat dance, the dragon dance, and the national unity dance in Tiananmen Square. There was also a choir of more than 2,000 people, singing "The Youth of the Motherland" all the way. Many costumed actors performed the most exciting scenes from dramas and operas on sixteen mobile "stages."

The sports contingent of 15,000 athletes aroused great interest. Among them was a gymnastics team composed of student athletes, performing beautiful rattan circle exercises, colored ribbon exercises, club exercises, and dumbbell exercises. Hundreds of amateur male and female motorcycle athletes also drove their motorcycles in formation into the square.

During the parade, nine silver-gray and yellow gliders performed a flight show. They flew in formation from east to west over Tiananmen at an altitude of 1,500 meters. Following the glider team were nine red trainer aircraft. When the gliders and trainer aircraft passed over Tiananmen, they tilted their wings to salute the audience.

Today's celebration activities began at 10:00 a.m. At 2:00 p.m., the entire parade passed through Tiananmen Square.

At this time, Young Pioneers, workers, government staff, and spectators on the south side of the square and on both sides of the road to the left and right of Tiananmen flocked to Tiananmen to cheer and pay tribute to Chairman Mao and other national leaders.

Amid the cheers of "Long live the Communist Party of China" and "Long live Chairman Mao," Chairman Mao and other leaders walked to the east and west ends of the Tiananmen reviewing stand, waving to the tens of thousands of cheering people on the stands and in the square.
