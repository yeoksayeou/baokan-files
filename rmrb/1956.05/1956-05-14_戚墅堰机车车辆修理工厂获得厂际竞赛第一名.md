The Qishuyan Rolling Stock Repair Factory has achieved great success in production since it initiated an inter-factory competition with railway rolling stock repair factories across the country at the beginning of this year. The factory not only comprehensively completed various task targets, but also exceeded the planned targets for total output value, labor productivity, and product cost, and the product quality was also relatively good. All passenger cars repaired by this factory in the first quarter eliminated rework upon leaving the factory, and the rework rate for locomotives and freight cars was also lower than that of general factories. Recently, the Ministry of Railways issued an order announcing the results of the first quarter national railway factory inter-factory competition evaluation. The Qishuyan Rolling Stock Repair Factory was rated first. The Ministry of Railways has awarded it the winning circulating red flag and a bonus of 22,850 yuan.

    戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂获得厂际竞赛第一名
    戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂自从今年年初向全国各铁路机车车辆修理工厂倡议开展厂际竞赛以来，生产中取得了很大的成绩。这个工厂不但全面完成了各项任务指标，而且总产值、劳动生产率、产品成本等指标都超额完成了计划，产品质量也较好。这个厂修理的客车，在第一季度内已经全部消灭了出厂返工车，机车、货车的返工率也比一般工厂为低。日前铁道部发出命令，公布了第一季度全国铁路工厂厂际竞赛的评比结果。戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂被评为第一名。铁道部已经授予它优胜循环红旗，并且奖给奖金二万二千八百五十元。
