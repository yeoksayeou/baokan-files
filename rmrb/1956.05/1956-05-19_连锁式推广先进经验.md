Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    The State-owned Tianjin No. 4 Cotton Textile Factory, after adopting a chain-style method to promote advanced experiences in fourteen work processes such as fine yarn spinning and weaving, has seen over 90% of its workers learn many advanced experiences in the past month.

    The chain-style method of promoting advanced experiences involves first having trained workers act as "little teachers," teaching the advanced experiences they have learned to the shift leaders, who then teach them to the deputy foremen. After mastering the experiences, each deputy foreman is responsible for teaching three backbone members of their group, and each backbone member must promote the advanced experiences they have learned to two to three workers in their group. Teaching contracts were also signed at each stage of promotion. In this way, like a chain, one link is connected to another, resulting in faster promotion and better results.

    连锁式推广先进经验
    国营天津第四棉纺织厂的细纱、织布等十四个工种，采取连锁式推广先进经验的方法后，最近一个月来有90％以上的工人学会好多先进经验。
    连锁式推广先进经验的方法，是先由受过训练的工人当“小先生”，把自己学到的先进经验教给值班长，然后再由每个值班长教给副工长。副工长在掌握经验以后，各人负责教会三个小组骨干，每个小组骨干就得把所学到的先进经验向两个到三个同组的工人推广。各个环节在推广的时候还签订了教学合同。这样像锁链似的一个环节扣一个环节，因而推广的速度快，效果好。　　（据新华社讯）
