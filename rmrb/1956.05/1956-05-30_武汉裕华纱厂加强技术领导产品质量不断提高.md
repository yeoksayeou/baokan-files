    Wuhan Yuhua Textile Mill, a joint state-private enterprise, has seen its product quality improve month by month during the advanced producer movement. The standard product rate for cotton yarn at this mill was 54.13% in February, 79.45% in March, 94.99% in April, and reached 100% in the first ten days of May. The substandard cloth rate decreased from 5.79% in February to 3.47% in the first ten days of May. In recent months, the mill has completed its plans for output value, production volume, labor productivity, cost, and profit relatively well.

    To improve product quality, the factory's leadership has focused on strengthening technical leadership. During the advanced producer movement, they first paid attention to mobilizing technical personnel, showing concern for them in their lives, and supporting them in their work, enabling them to work boldly and responsibly. They adopted a "one key opens one lock" approach among the workers, conducting relatively in-depth individual ideological education work and helping workers with difficult living conditions to solve their problems. They also established a "quality quota tracking and inspection system" to identify the key to each quality problem and propose technical measures. Around the key issues of the factory, they summarized and promoted nineteen advanced experiences from within the factory and learned twenty-nine advanced experiences from other factories, resulting in significant improvements in production.

    The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to promote the experience of the Yuhua Textile Mill in leading the advanced producer movement throughout the city.

    武汉裕华纱厂加强技术领导产品质量不断提高
    武汉市公私合营裕华纱厂的产品质量在先进生产者运动中逐月上升。这个厂棉纱的标准品率，二月份为54.13％，三月份为79.45％，四月份为94.99％，五月上旬达到100％。次布率由二月份的5.79％降低到五月上旬的3.47％，这个厂几个月来的产值、产量、劳动生产率、成本、利润等计划都完成得比较好。
    这个工厂的领导人员为提高产品质量，抓紧了加强技术领导这个环节。他们在先进生产者运动中，首先注意发动了技术人员，在生活上关怀他们，在工作上支持他们，使他们能大胆负责地工作。他们在职工中采取“一把钥匙开一把锁”的办法，进行了比较深入的个别思想教育工作，并且帮助生活困难的职工解决困难。他们还建立了“质量限额追踪检查制度”，找出每个质量问题的关键，提出技术措施。他们围绕本厂的关键问题，一共总结和推广了本厂的先进经验十九条，学习了外厂的先进经验二十九条，使生产有了显著改进。
    中共武汉市委已经决定在全市推广裕华纱厂领导先进生产者运动的经验。
