Xinhua News Agency, April 30th. The Council Meeting of the International Democratic Women's Federation (IDWF) in Beijing successfully concluded at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Auditorium on the afternoon of April 30th.

After seven days of plenary sessions and committee discussions, the Council meeting unanimously passed four documents at its final plenary session this afternoon: the "June 1st" International Children's Day Appeal to Women, Mothers, and Women's Organizations Worldwide, a letter to Asian and African Women, a statement on cooperation with women's groups, and a resolution on the tasks of the IDWF.

A total of one hundred and eighty-three council members, special representatives, and guests from forty-eight countries attended this Council meeting. They came from different social strata, ranging from government ministers, members of parliament, heads of large enterprises, trade union workers, educators, medical personnel, to housewives who have not yet had the opportunity to learn to read. Among them were many well-known activists in the international women's movement, and some were representatives who had just established women's organizations in their countries and were invited to attend an IDWF meeting for the first time.

A total of fifty-one council members and special representatives spoke at the plenary session, more than half of whom were from Asian and African countries, demonstrating the eager expectations and concern of women in Asian and African countries for this Council meeting. The speakers all emphasized the need to continue to promote the Bandung spirit, oppose colonialism, oppose war, and oppose the establishment of aggressive military blocs. They also unanimously pointed out that in order to achieve the above goals, and to strive for their own rights and the happiness of children, women must unite more widely and strengthen friendly cooperation between various international women's organizations, individuals, and various national women's organizations and individuals.

The final plenary session of the Council was held at 3:00 PM on April 30th. The three special representatives from Pakistan, who had just arrived in Beijing on the afternoon of April 29th, also attended the meeting.

After Executive Chairwoman Madame Gordon announced the opening of the meeting, Pakistani special representative Madame Galen addressed the conference, and Lebanese special representative Madame Behom also made a statement to the conference.

Madame Galen introduced the situation of women in Pakistan and the desire of Pakistani women to oppose war and demand peaceful coexistence between countries. She said: "We not only believe that different countries can coexist peacefully, but also believe in mutually beneficial peaceful cooperation."

Lebanese Madame Behom's statement said that this was her first time participating in an IDWF activity. She was satisfied with the meeting and believed that the entire meeting reflected the deep-rooted Bandung spirit. She said: National independence is inseparable from world peace, just as women's rights are inseparable from national independence. Mankind should cooperate in accordance with the Bandung spirit.

Next, representatives from Germany, Madagascar, Egypt, Tunisia, Nepal and other countries presented gifts to the conference.

The conference then entered the agenda of reporting and passing various documents one by one. All these documents were unanimously approved by the audience, with no opposition and no abstentions.

Madame Gordon suggested to the conference to revoke the decision made by the IDWF Council meeting in Moscow in November 1949 to expel the Yugoslav Council member. Representatives from the Soviet Union, Italy, and Czechoslovakia spoke in support of this resolution. During the vote, the audience applauded enthusiastically and unanimously approved the suggestion.

Madame Gordon delivered the closing speech. Madame Gordon said that at this meeting, she had heard very rich speeches from council members and representatives of many countries on the content of the women's movement, and especially the ability to directly contact women from Asia and Africa, which enabled us to consider many issues.

Madame Gordon pointed out that the IDWF has always attached importance to cooperation with various countries and groups since its establishment, and now it is necessary to develop this cooperation more widely. We must implement the Bandung spirit in our work. Extensive cooperation is the guiding spirit of the IDWF's activities. In this spirit, the IDWF will unite hundreds of millions of women more widely in the future.

When Madame Gordon finished her speech, the audience stood up and broke into lasting applause.

At this time, the All-China Women's Federation presented a gift to the presidium of the conference.

In the music and applause, a team of Young Pioneers entered the venue and delivered a congratulatory speech to the conference. Two hundred Young Pioneers, holding flowers and carrying small flower baskets, poured into the venue in two lines, presented flowers to the presidium, and sprinkled flower petals on the representatives below the stage. Madame Gordon and other representatives warmly welcomed them with hugs and kisses.

The conference officially closed at 4:15 PM.

    国际民主妇联理事会北京会议闭幕
    号召全世界妇女在保卫和平和保卫妇女权利的斗争中加强团结和合作
    新华社30日讯　国际民主妇女联合会理事会北京会议四月三十日下午在北京政协礼堂胜利闭幕。
    在经过七天的全体会议和小组委员会的讨论后，理事会会议在今天下午最后一次全体会议上，全体一致地通过了“六一”国际儿童节告全世界妇女、母亲和妇女团体书，告亚洲、非洲妇女书，关于和妇女团体合作的声明以及关于国际民主妇联任务的决议等四个文件。
    出席这次理事会会议的，一共有四十八个国家，一百八十三个理事、特邀代表和来宾。她们来自不同的社会阶层，从政府部长、国会议员、大企业负责人、工会工作者、教育工作者、医务人员一直到还没有得到识字机会的家庭主妇。她们中间有许多是国际妇女运动的著名活动家，也有一些是在她们的国家里刚刚建立起妇女组织、第一次被邀请来参加国际民主妇联会议的代表。
    在全体会议上，共计有五十一位理事和特邀代表发了言，其中来自亚非国家的占一半以上，这说明亚非国家妇女对这次理事会会议的殷切期望和关怀。发言的人都强调指出必须继续发扬万隆精神，反对殖民主义，反对战争，反对建立侵略性的军事集团。她们还一致指出，妇女们为要达到上述目的，为要争取自身权利和儿童幸福，就必须更加广泛地团结起来，加强国际间各种不同的妇女团体、个人，以及各国各种不同的妇女团体和个人之间的友好合作。
    理事会最后一次全体会议是在四月三十日下午三时举行的。刚刚在四月二十九日下午赶到北京的三位巴基斯坦的特邀代表也出席了这次会议。
    在执行主席戈登夫人宣布开会后，巴基斯坦的特邀代表加伦夫人向大会发了言，黎巴嫩的特邀代表贝霍姆夫人也向大会发表了声明。
    加伦夫人向大会介绍了巴基斯坦妇女的情况以及巴基斯坦妇女反对战争、要求国与国之间和平共处的愿望。她说：“我们不但相信不同的国家能够和平共处，并且还相信互利的和平合作。”
    黎巴嫩贝霍姆夫人的声明说，这是她第一次参加国际民主妇联的活动。她对这次会议感到满意，认为整个会议反映出万隆精神的深入人心。她说：民族的独立同世界和平是分不开的，就像妇女权利同民族独立分不开一样。人类应该遵照万隆精神进行合作。
    接着，德国代表团、马达加斯加、埃及、突尼斯、尼泊尔等国家的代表向大会献了礼。
    大会至此进入逐一报告、并且通过各项文件的议程。这些文件都获得全场一致表决通过，没有一个反对，没有一个弃权。
    戈登夫人向大会建议撤销1949年11月国际民主妇联理事会莫斯科会议所作的关于开除南斯拉夫理事的决定。苏联、意大利和捷克斯洛伐克的代表发言支持这一决议。表决时，全场热烈鼓掌，一致通过了这个建议。
    戈登夫人致闭幕词。戈登夫人说，在这次会议中听到了很多国家的理事、代表关于妇女运动的内容非常丰富的发言，特别是能够同来自亚洲和非洲国家的妇女直接接触，这使我们能够考虑许多问题。
    戈登夫人指出，国际民主妇联自从成立以来就一直重视同各个国家、各种团体合作，现在要更广泛地发展这种合作。我们要把万隆精神贯彻在我们的工作中。广泛合作是国际民主妇联活动的主导精神。本着这种精神，国际民主妇联将在今后更加广泛地团结亿万妇女。
    戈登夫人致词完毕，全场起立，爆发了经久不息的掌声。
    这时，中华全国民主妇女联合会向大会主席团献礼。
    在乐曲和鼓掌声中，一队少年先锋队员进入会场，向大会致颂词。二百个少先队员捧着鲜花，提着小花篮分两路拥进会场，向主席团献花，并且向台下的代表洒花瓣。戈登夫人和其他代表用拥抱和亲吻热烈地欢迎他们。
    大会在下午四时三刻正式闭幕。
