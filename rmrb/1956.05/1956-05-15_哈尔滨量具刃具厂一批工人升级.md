A Batch of Workers at Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant Promoted

    The Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant promoted the technical grades of another 1,142 workers on the 10th.

    He Yufu, promoted from Level 2 worker to Level 4 worker, can skillfully tend eight milling machines for large drill bits simultaneously on his own. Yu Guifang, a female grinding worker who was promoted to Level 3 worker, is a new worker who graduated from a technical school last June. She has not only mastered the technique of grinding precision gauge blocks, a job that requires a Level 5 technician, but also overfulfilled her quota by 30%.

    The average technical grade of the plant's workers has increased from 3.3 in the first quarter to 4.03.

    Since the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant fully implemented the monetary wage system and piece-rate wage system in January this year, the average labor productivity of workers in the first quarter has increased by 34% compared with the plan. The average wage income of workers has also increased by more than 25% over the past year.

    The plant pays close attention to regular assessments, training, and other work to improve the technical level of workers. More than 90% of the plant's employees participate in spare-time cultural and technical studies. The plant and workshops have also established worker assessment and grading committees, which regularly promote workers' technical grades based on technical standards and the actual production situation of the workers. From July last year to now, more than 2,100 workers in the plant have been promoted in technical grade; some have been promoted three times. (Xinhua News Agency)

    哈尔滨量具刃具厂一批工人升级
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂在十日又提升了1，142个工人的技术等级。
    由二级工提升为四级工的何玉福，他一个人能灵巧地同时看管八台铣大钻头的铣床。被提升为三级工的女研磨工庾桂芳，是去年六月间从技工学校毕业的新工人，她现在不但掌握了需要五级技工干的活——研磨精密量具块规的技术，而且还超额30％完成了定额。
    这个厂工人的平均技术等级，已经从第一季度的三点三级提高到四点零三级。
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂在今年一月份全面实行货币工资制和计件工资制以后，第一季度工人平均劳动生产率比计划提高了34％。工人的平均工资收入一年来也提高了25％以上。
    这个厂十分注意经常性的考评、培训等提高工人技术水平的工作，全厂有90％以上职工参加业余文化技术学习，工厂和车间还建立考工评级委员会，经常地根据技术标准和工人实际生产情况，提升工人技术等级。从去年七月到现在，全厂有二千一百多人次提升了技术等级；有的人提升了三次。　（新华社）
