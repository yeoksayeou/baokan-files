Correctly Treat Backward Workers

In the upsurge of the socialist competition, many workers who were originally relatively backward in production have caught up with the advanced producers. The transformation of these workers is due, on the one hand, to the powerful encouragement of the socialist revolution's high tide to the working masses; on the other hand, it is also due to some improvement in the political work of the Party organizations of industrial and mining enterprises towards the working masses. However, it should be pointed out that the issue of how the Party organizations, administrative leaders, and trade union organizations of industrial and mining enterprises should correctly treat the so-called backward workers has not been completely resolved, and even some quite serious problems still exist.

Many leading cadres of industrial and mining enterprises, as soon as they see that some people have not completed their production plans well, simply and without analysis label these people as "backward elements." In fact, there are various reasons why these people cannot complete their plans well. Some people really cannot complete their plans because of their low class consciousness, weak sense of responsibility, and poor labor discipline; but some people cannot concentrate on production because of greater difficulties in their family life; some people cannot complete production plans because of defects in administrative management or technical management directly related to their labor... Since the situation is so complex, the leadership of industrial and mining enterprises should not indiscriminately label all these people as "backward elements." If it is a matter for which the leadership should be responsible, they should not shirk their responsibility onto the workers.

After specific analysis, it will be found that some of the workers who were previously considered backward are not backward in production. How is this happening? This is because a small number of Party organizations in industrial and mining enterprises separate "production" from "politics," often looking only at whether workers regularly attend meetings and actively speak at meetings, regardless of their labor attitude and production performance, and regard those who cannot regularly attend meetings and cannot actively speak as "backward elements." Sometimes strange things even happen in industrial and mining enterprises: there are so-called "backward elements" who are actively responsible for production and complete production plans well, and there are so-called "advanced elements" who often fail to complete production plans. Today, when we measure a worker's class consciousness, we must first look at his attitude towards socialist labor. It is naturally inappropriate to examine a worker's political consciousness apart from this point.

Some workers are also regarded as "backward elements" because they dare to offer opinions and criticisms on the leadership work of the enterprise. Liu Jinmu, a line worker at Jinan Railway Station, is an advanced producer who can often complete his plans and has created a set of advanced working methods. Because he dared to offer opinions to leading cadres, he was considered a backward element who "disobeys leadership" and has "poor discipline." It was not until recently that the leaders of Jinan Railway Station discovered that Liu Jinmu was an advanced producer. This practice clearly violates the principles of socialist enterprise management. As leaders of state-owned enterprises, they must humbly listen to all opinions and criticisms from the masses, and must adopt various methods to closely connect with the working masses, listen to the opinions of the working masses, and concentrate the wisdom of the working masses. Only in this way can we run enterprises well.

For the current so-called backward workers, enterprise Party organizations must conduct specific analysis, and must distinguish between active elements who dare to offer correct criticisms to the leadership, and those who are not backward in production but only have individual shortcomings and errors, from backward workers. Only after making this correct distinction can we deal with the problems existing and raised by these workers correctly according to different situations.

What attitude should be adopted towards workers who are indeed backward in production? What methods should be used to help these workers overcome their shortcomings and correct their mistakes? Comrade Liu Shaoqi, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, clearly pointed out in his congratulatory speech at the National Congress of Advanced Producers: "In socialist society, there are still contradictions between the advanced and the backward, but this contradiction is not an antagonistic contradiction; the basic method for socialist society to resolve this contradiction is through the conscious efforts of the working masses, through education and criticism, to continuously raise the backward to the level of the advanced." But unfortunately, not all enterprise leaders understand this truth. The entire factory or the entire workshop sometimes cannot complete the plan well because the production of some workers is backward, which is certainly a very "annoying" thing. But in the final analysis, who should bear the responsibility first? The enterprise leadership should bear it first. Because one of the responsibilities of the leader is to be good at driving the backward with the advanced, so that the backward reach the advanced level. If the backward fail to reach the advanced level for a long time, it is primarily because the leaders have not done the necessary work for them. May I ask, who should be responsible for this if not the leaders?

To enable leading cadres of industrial and mining enterprises to adopt a correct attitude towards backward workers, the following two issues must be resolved.

First of all, in theory, although no one currently denies that backward workers can become advanced workers, in practical work, many people do not believe that backward workers can become advanced workers. This is mainly manifested in the fact that some enterprise leaders adopt a discriminatory, exclusionary, and even deeply resentful attitude towards backward workers. They not only do not conduct persuasion and education on these workers, but also demand that these workers be transferred away, and are even more unwilling to transfer backward workers to their own workshops or sections. This is because, in their view, these workers are forever backward and are "rotten wood that cannot be carved." This view is of course very wrong. Things are constantly changing, and the relationship between backward, intermediate, and advanced is also constantly changing. Today's backwardness may catch up with the advanced tomorrow. In this year's upsurge of socialist competition, haven't many workers who were backward in production become advanced producers? The question is whether enterprise leaders, especially enterprise Party organizations, care about these workers, and whether they have carried out the necessary persuasion and education work for these workers.

Secondly, many Party organizations in industrial and mining enterprises adopt a rough attitude towards a small number of workers because they have an incorrect understanding of "advanced thought and backward thought must be struggled against." Advanced thought, of course, must be struggled against backward thought. The question is how to struggle. Some Party organizations understand this struggle as launching advanced workers and other workers to satirize and attack backward workers. Therefore, some enterprise leaders are accustomed to holding "struggle sessions" against backward workers; some factories often publish the names of backward workers and advanced workers at the same time, and further uglify backward workers in various ways, which is essentially encouraging everyone to discriminate against and attack these workers. This practice is by no means the correct way to treat working-class brothers. The ideological struggle within the working class should be to promote the conscious ideological struggle of backward workers by publicizing the advanced deeds and advanced thoughts of advanced workers, and by conducting well-intentioned education and necessary appropriate criticism of workers with relatively backward thoughts, and to help them strive to overcome backward thoughts and establish advanced thoughts. However, many enterprise leaders have adopted an impermissible wrong attitude and wrong practices on this issue. This wrong attitude and wrong practices towards ideological struggle have also been supported by a small number of activists among the workers, and therefore, this error has had the opportunity to develop in a few factories and mines.

Experience has proven that as long as the method of enthusiastic help, persuasion, and education is adopted for workers with more serious shortcomings or more serious errors, the vast majority of them can gradually transform. When the leaders of the 53rd Factory discovered that the workers who were relatively backward in the past were asking to catch up with the advanced workers, they immediately actively and enthusiastically helped them to improve. The Party organizations of each workshop also specifically assigned Communist Party members and activists to specifically help these workers one-on-one. The Party organization also pointed out that it is necessary to use the method of opening a lock with a specific key, patiently talk to them individually according to the characteristics of each person, help them formulate personal plans, often care about the situation of their personal plans, and publicly commend their progress, so as to form a public opinion in the masses that welcomes progress and encourages progress. As a result, many backward workers have completed their personal plans, and some have even created advanced operating methods. Many factories in Shanghai have also made great progress in their attitude towards backward workers. The Party organizations of these factories have criticized the past simple, rude, and indifferent attitude towards backward workers, and adopted the method of doing individual work through Party members, patiently educating backward workers, and helping backward workers overcome difficulties and do a good job in production. Zhang Bingliang, the only seventh-grade worker in the large parts workshop of Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, used to be often rudely excluded and demoted because he often produced defective products, and his emotions have not been good. Later, the Party branch appointed Communist Party member Zhang Yushu to be responsible for conducting individual education work on Zhang Bingliang. Under Zhang Yushu's patient help, Zhang Bingliang realized his ideological shortcomings and overcame these shortcomings, becoming the backbone of production.

Of course, it is by no means to say that in any case, only persuasion and education can be used for the working masses, and necessary disciplinary actions cannot be taken. For a very small number of people who seriously disrupt labor discipline and cause great losses to the country, or who are infected with extremely bad hooligan habits, disrupt production and even social order, and repeatedly refuse to be reformed despite repeated education, strict disciplinary actions must be taken, and even expulsion from the factory and handover to state law for punishment. Failure to sanction such extremely rare exceptions would alienate the masses and cause great losses to the country. However, such people are, after all, extremely rare exceptions in the factory; even the punishment of these people needs to be carried out on the basis of persuasion and education, and should not be a simple punishment, because simple punishment cannot educate them, let alone the vast number of workers.

### 正确地对待落后工人

    正确地对待落后工人
    在社会主义竞赛高潮中，有不少生产上原来比较落后的工人，赶上了先进生产者。这些工人的转变，一方面是由于社会主义革命高潮对工人群众的有力的鼓舞；另一方面也是由于工矿企业党组织对工人群众的政治工作有所改进。但是应该指出，工矿企业党组织、行政领导和工会组织如何正确地对待所谓落后工人的问题，并没有完全得到解决，甚至还存在着相
  当严重的问题。
    许多工矿企业领导干部，只要一看到有些人的生产计划完成得不好，就简单地不加分析地给这些人扣上了“落后分子”的帽子。事实上，这些人不能很好地完成计划，有多种多样的原因。有的人确实因为阶级觉悟不高，责任心不强，劳动纪律性不好，因而不能完成计划；但是也有的人是因为家庭生活困难较大，以致不能集中精力进行生产；有的人还因为直接同他的劳动有关的行政管理工作或技术管理工作方面有缺点，而不能完成生产计划……。既然情况如此复杂，工矿企业领导方面，就不能不加分析地给这些人都扣上“落后分子”的帽子。如果是领导方面应该负责的事情，更不应该把责任推卸到工人身上。
    经过具体分析之后，还会发现过去被认为落后的工人中，有一部分人生产上并不落后。这是怎么一回事呢？这是因为少数工矿企业党组织，把“生产”和“政治”割裂开来，经常不看工人的劳动态度和生产成绩，只看工人是不是经常参加会议，在会上是不是积极发言，并且把不能经常参加会议，不能积极发言的人，当做“落后分子”。有时工矿企业里竟出现了这样奇怪的事情：有所谓生产积极负责、生产计划完成得很好的“落后分子”，有所谓生产计划经常完不成的“先进分子”。我们今天衡量一个工人的阶级觉悟，首先不能不看他对待社会主义劳动的态度，离开这一点来考察一个工人的政治觉悟，自然是不适当的。
    也有些工人被当做“落后分子”，是因为他们敢于对企业领导工作提出意见和批评。济南火车站线路工人刘金木，是一个经常能够完成计划，并且已经创造了一套先进工作方法的先进生产者，就因为他敢于对领导干部提出意见，结果，就被认为是“不服从领导”、“纪律性差”的落后分子。直到最近，济南火车站领导方面才发现，原来刘金木是个先进生产者。这种作法显然违背了社会主义企业管理原则。作为国家企业的领导人员，必须虚心听取来自群众的一切意见和批评，必须采用各种各样的办法，密切同工人群众的联系，听取工人群众的意见，集中工人群众的智慧。只有这样，才能办好企业。
    对于目前的所谓落后工人，企业党组织必须加以具体分析，必须把敢于对领导提出正确批评的积极分子，以及生产上并不落后而只是有个别缺点和错误的人，同落后工人区别开来。在作了这种正确的区别以后，才能分别不同情况，正确地处理有关这些工人所存在和所提出的问题。
    对生产上确实落后的工人应该采取什么态度呢？应该采用什么方法来帮助这些工人克服缺点和改正错误呢？刘少奇同志代表中共中央在全国先进生产者代表会议上祝词中，已经明确地指出：“在社会主义社会里，仍然有先进和落后的矛盾，但是这种矛盾不是对抗性的矛盾；社会主义社会解决这种矛盾的基本方法，就是通过劳动群众的自觉的努力，通过教育和批评的方式，不断地把落后提高到先进的水平。”但是可惜并不是所有企业领导者都懂得了这个真理。整个工厂或整个车间，有时因为某些工人的生产落后而不能很好地完成计划，这当然是一件很使人“恼火”的事情。但是归根结底，责任首先应当谁来负呢？首先应当由企业领导方面来负。因为领导者的责任之一，就是善于通过以先进带动落后，使落后达到先进的水平。落后的长期达不到先进的水平，首先是因为领导者没有对他们进行必要的工作。试问，这责任不该领导者负该谁负呢？
    要使工矿企业领导干部对落后工人采取正确的态度，必须解决以下两个问题。
    首先，在理论上，目前虽没有一个人会否认落后工人有可能变为先进工人，但是在实际工作中，的确有不少人是不相信落后工人有可能变为先进工人的。这主要表现在一部分企业领导干部对落后工人采取歧视、排斥甚至深恶痛绝的态度。他们不但不对这些工人进行说服教育，而且要求把这些工人调走，更不愿把落后工人调到自己车间、自己工段。这就是因为在他们看来，这些工人是永远落后的，是“朽木不可雕也”。这种看法当然是很错误的。事物是在不断变化着，落后、中间、先进之间的关系也是在不断地变化着的，今天落后，明天就可能赶上了先进。在今年的社会主义竞赛高潮中，不是已经有不少生产落后的工人变成了先进生产者吗？问题就在于企业领导者特别是企业党组织，是不是关心这些工人，是不是对这些工人进行了必要的说服教育工作。
    其次，不少工矿企业党组织对少数工人所以采取粗暴的态度，又因为他们对“先进思想和落后思想必须进行斗争”有着不正确的理解。先进思想当然要同落后思想进行斗争。问题在于怎样斗争。有些党组织把这种斗争理解为就是发动先进工人及其他工人对落后工人进行讽刺和打击。因此，有些企业领导干部习惯于对落后工人开“斗争会”；有些工厂常常把落后工人和先进工人的名字同时公布，并且把落后工人多方加以丑化，这实质上是鼓动大家对这些工人加以歧视和打击。这种作法决不是对待工人兄弟的正确办法。工人阶级内部的思想斗争，应当是通过对先进工人的先进事迹、先进思想的宣传，通过对思想比较落后的工人进行善意的教育和必要的适当的批评，来促进落后工人的自觉的思想斗争，帮助他们努力克服落后思想，树立先进思想。但是不少企业领导干部对这个问题采取了不可容许的错误的态度和错误的作法，这种对思想斗争的错误的态度和错误的作法还得到了工人群众中一小部分积极分子的支持，因此，这种错误在少数厂矿中得到了发展的机会。
    经验证明，对有比较严重的缺点或有比较严重的错误的工人，只要采取热情帮助说服教育的方法，他们中的绝大多数人是可以逐渐转变的。五三工厂的领导方面发现过去比较落后的工人，纷纷要求赶上先进工人的时候，随即积极地热情地帮助他们进步。各个车间的党组织也都具体地分配共产党员和积极分子一个对一个地去具体帮助这些工人。党组织还指出，必须用一把钥匙开一把锁的办法，根据每个人的特点，耐心地去同他们个别地谈心，帮助他们订个人计划，经常关心他们实现个人计划的情况，公开地表扬他们的进步，在群众中形成欢迎进步、鼓励进步的舆论。结果，许多落后工人完成了个人计划，有的还创造了先进的操作方法。上海市的许多工厂在对待落后工人的态度上也有了很大的进步。这些工厂的党组织都批判了过去对落后工人的简单粗暴漠不关心的态度，采用通过党员做个别工作的办法，耐心地教育落后工人，帮助落后工人克服困难，搞好生产。上海机床厂大件车间的唯一的七级工人张炳良，过去因为常出废品经常受到粗暴的排斥，而且被降了级，他的情绪一直不好。后来，党支部指定了共产党员张玉书负责对张炳良进行个别教育工作。在张玉书耐心的帮助下，张炳良认识了自己思想上的缺点，并且克服了这些缺点，成为生产中的骨干。
    当然，决不是说，不论什么情况，对工人群众就只能说服教育，而不能执行必要的纪律处分。对于极少数严重地破坏劳动纪律、给国家造成很大损失的分子，或者沾染了极恶劣的流氓习气、破坏生产以至社会秩序、而又屡教不改的坏分子，必须给予严格的纪律处分，甚至开除出厂，交付国家法律制裁。对于这样极少数的例外如果不给予制裁，那也会脱离群众，并且给国家造成很大的损失。但是，这样的人在工厂里毕竟是极少数的例外；就是对这些人的处分，也需要在说服教育的基础上进行，而不应当是单纯的处罚，因为单纯的处罚固然不能教育他们，尤其不能教育广大的工人群众。
