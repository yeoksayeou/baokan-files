Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 11th. Warsaw newspapers report that Poland has manufactured its first "SM-1" helicopter. This helicopter can fly 200 kilometers per hour and has three seats: one for the pilot and two for passengers.

This aircraft was manufactured with Soviet assistance, using Soviet technical design documents, and mass production will begin in a few months.

In other news, the Gdańsk Shipyard in Poland has begun construction of a ship called the "Bottomless Ship." When this ship transports sand and waste to the deep sea, it opens its bottom to dump the waste into the sea. A special device is installed to ensure that the ship does not sink when unloading cargo by opening the bottom. The main purpose of this ship is to transport sand and gravel excavated near seaports to the deep sea when deepening ports.

    波兰制成第一架直升飞机
    并正建造“无底船”
    新华社华沙11日电　华沙报纸报道，波兰已经制成第一架“SM—1”型直升飞机。这种直升飞机每小时可以飞行二百公里，它有三个座位，一个是飞行师的座位，两个是旅客座位。
    这种飞机是在苏联的帮助下采用苏联的技术设计文件制造的，数月后将开始大批生产。
    另外的消息说，波兰革但斯克造船厂已经开始建造一种叫做“无底船”的轮船。这种轮船把沙子和废物运到深海中的时候，就打开船底把废物抛入海底。在打开船底抛卸载货时，由于安装有一种特殊装置，可以保证轮船不致下沉。这种船的主要用途是在海港附近挖深港口时，把挖出的沙石运卸到深海中去。
