Editorial: Develop Rural Sideline Occupations

    The income from sideline occupations of farmers in our country generally accounts for one-third of the total income from agriculture and sideline occupations. In some mountainous areas, the proportion of sideline occupations is more than 50%. If the sideline income of farmers in our country is concentrated, it can even be said that among the 500 million farmers, about 100 million people rely solely on sideline occupations to make a living. This figure fully demonstrates the important significance of sideline production to the prosperity of the national economy.
    However, from last winter to this spring, sideline production in many areas has declined significantly. Sideline income in some areas has decreased by one-third to one-half.
    How is this phenomenon caused? Does it mean that farmers no longer value sideline occupations after joining cooperatives? That is not the case. Most farmers have not yet undergone a distribution after joining cooperatives last winter and this spring. Some people still have difficulties in life, and most people are not yet wealthy. They are eager to engage in diverse sideline production activities in addition to agricultural production, on the one hand to solve the current difficulties in life, and on the other hand to enrich the funds for agricultural production. Farmers fully understand how important sideline production is, and they are dissatisfied with the current decline in sideline production.
    Since farmers actively demand the development of sideline occupations, why has sideline production declined in many areas?
    Many rural work cadres, including some county and district party and government leading cadres, inspired by the high tide of cooperativization and the "National Agricultural Development Program," have devoted all their efforts to developing agriculture, using all manpower, material resources, and financial resources for agricultural production, and have quickly achieved great results. It is correct to emphasize agriculture. However, they have placed agriculture and sideline occupations in opposition to each other, burying themselves in the development of agriculture, and intentionally or unintentionally relaxing sideline occupations. The main reason for the decline in sideline occupations lies here.
    During the transition period, and even for several generations to come, sideline occupations are an important production sector that supports agricultural production, increases farmers' income, meets the needs of urban and rural people, and supplies certain export goods. Doesn't the economic stagnation caused by the decline of sideline occupations in many areas at present most powerfully prove the importance of sideline occupations? Society cannot only have agriculture without sideline occupations, just as people cannot only eat grain without non-staple food. Therefore, to measure the achievements of a cooperative, we must not only look at whether agricultural production has developed, but also whether sideline production has developed; we must not only look at whether the cooperative has increased public accumulation, but also whether each member has increased actual income. Focusing on agriculture and neglecting sideline occupations will cause significant losses to the country and the people, and there are many examples of this. The Niujuanbi Township of Macheng County, Hubei Province, has four cooperatives (totaling 368 households), and agricultural production has developed year by year. In 1948, their agricultural income was more than 24,000 yuan, which increased to more than 35,000 yuan in 1951, more than 41,000 yuan in 1953, and more than 54,000 yuan in 1955. Agricultural production has more than doubled in a few years, and the speed can be said to be very fast! However, let's look at their sideline income! It was more than 42,000 yuan in 1948, dropped to more than 28,000 yuan in 1951, dropped again to more than 26,000 yuan in 1953, and dropped further to more than 14,000 yuan in 1955. Combining agricultural and sideline income, the income in a few years is almost exactly the same. The total income of farmers has not increased, some semi-laborers have no work to do, and the further development of agricultural production has been greatly limited. Isn't the serious consequence of neglecting sideline occupations something that should be thought-provoking?
    There are good conditions for extensively developing sideline production everywhere in rural areas of our country. As long as they are well utilized, rural sideline occupations will develop rapidly. The Shengfang Town of Baxian County, Hebei Province, has 21 cooperatives, which engaged in sideline activities such as fishing and weaving from February to April this year, with an income of more than 700,000 yuan. Each cooperative has pre-distributed more than 500,000 yuan to the members, and used the remaining more than 200,000 yuan to purchase fertilizers, pesticides, power machinery, etc. The sideline income of these 21 cooperatives is estimated to be more than 3.3 million yuan by the end of the year, with each household receiving more than 350 yuan, equivalent to more than 3,000 catties of grain, equivalent to the income of about ten mu of medium-yielding land.
    Before agricultural cooperativization, farmers engaged in sideline production mostly during the slack seasons of the tenth lunar month, around the Spring Festival, and during agricultural gaps. At that time, farmers completely disregarded the labor cost of sideline production. Now, many cooperatives have set higher daily labor wages, but the remuneration for sideline production is relatively low. In order to get more remuneration, the members and the cadres of the society, in order to show the "superiority" of higher daily labor wages, concentrate their efforts on agriculture and relax sideline production. This approach is one-sided and therefore wrong. The Jiumu Agricultural Cooperative in Changsha County, Hunan Province, has made a detailed calculation and thoroughly solved this problem. This cooperative has a total of 460 households. If only agricultural production is carried out, the remuneration for each labor day can be 1.5 yuan, but each laborer can only work 163 days throughout the year, with an income of 244.5 yuan. In this way, 37.8% of the labor force in the whole cooperative has nothing to do, and the income of some members will be reduced. If sideline occupations are developed, each laborer can work 247 days throughout the year, and the unified distribution of agricultural and sideline occupations, although the remuneration for each labor day is only 1.3 yuan, the total annual income of each laborer is 321.1 yuan. Is it better to unilaterally pursue high remuneration for each labor day, regardless of the total income, or is it better to implement diversified operations and help farmers increase their total income? The example of the Jiumu Cooperative tells us that in order to solve this problem, we must determine an appropriate ratio of remuneration for agricultural and sideline occupations, so that members engaged in agricultural and sideline production do not suffer losses, and give appropriate material encouragement to members with high skills.
    The sideline occupations operated by farmers are very scattered. This kind of sideline occupation is suitable for the state of small-scale peasant economy. For thousands of years, it has existed and developed continuously, overcoming various difficulties and obstacles. After the realization of agricultural cooperativization, many agricultural production cooperatives have brought large-scale sideline occupations under the control of the society, but due to lack of experience, many cooperatives have not yet managed large-scale sideline occupations well. On the other hand, many cooperatives have set labor planning standards that are too high, leaving too little time for individual members, and the household sideline occupations of farmers have been restricted by time, and have gradually declined.
    There are thousands of rural sideline occupations, and the management methods should be diverse. Large-scale sideline occupations are suitable for collective operation by cooperatives, and cooperatives should formulate overall plans and concentrate their efforts to manage them well. Some sideline occupations are suitable for operation by production teams and production groups, and should be distributed to them in a timely manner to give full play to their enthusiasm. Most of the scattered sideline occupations are suitable for individual operation by members, and should never be forcibly centralized to form the cooperative's "package without management." To allow members to operate household sideline occupations, they must be given the necessary time, and necessary assistance and guidance should be given in terms of raw materials and sales. The CPC Gansu Provincial Committee has decided that cooperatives should leave 60 to 100 days for members each year, and the Shanxi Provincial Committee has decided that cooperatives should leave two months for members each year, for household sideline occupations and other personal activities, which are very necessary measures.
    Now, the party and government leading organs of many provinces and regions are gradually strengthening the leadership of sideline production. They have indeed grasped the key to solving the problem of sideline occupations. Only by strengthening leadership can we help cooperatives make comprehensive plans, solve problems such as raw material supply, product sales, and technical guidance in sideline production, and avoid and overcome the blindness that may arise in the process of great development. The CPC Jiangsu Provincial Committee has decided that the production cooperation department of the prefectural and county committees should have a deputy minister in charge of sideline production, and the agricultural production cooperative should have a deputy director in charge of sideline production. Xinhui County, Guangdong, has established an office for developing rural sideline occupations, including party and government leading organs and financial departments, to specifically lead this work. This kind of organizational measure to ensure the implementation of the correct policy should be adopted appropriately in all regions.
    After transplanting and sowing rice, there is a period of agricultural gap in each region. The party and government leading organs in each region should take advantage of this opportunity to restore the stagnant sideline production by adopting all feasible methods. Whoever truly pays attention to this issue will be able to come up with good solutions, just like the examples mentioned above.

### 发展农村副业

    发展农村副业
    我国农民经营副业的收入，一般占农副业总收入的三分之一。在某些山岳地区，副业比重在50％以上。如果把我国农民的副业收入集中起来，甚至可以这样说，在五亿农民当中，约有一亿多人专门倚靠副业过活。这个数字充分说明了副业生产对于繁荣国民经济的重要意义。
    但是，从去年冬季到今年春季，不少地区的副业生产却大大衰落了。某些地区的副业收入竟下降了三分之一到二分之一。
    这种现象是怎样造成的？难道农民入了合作社，就不重视副业了吗？事实并不是这样。多数农民在去冬今春参加合作社后，还没有经过一次分配。一部分人的生活还有困难，多数人的生活还不富裕。他们迫切希望在农业生产之外，从事多种多样的副业生产，一方面解决当前的生活困难，一方面充裕农业生产的资金。农民完全懂得副业生产是多么重要，他们对当前副业生产衰落的现象是不满意的。
    既然农民积极要求发展副业，许多地区的副业生产为什么衰落了呢？
    许多农村工作干部，包括某些县、区党政领导干部，为合作化高潮和“全国农业发展纲要”所鼓舞，全力发展农业，把一切人力、物力、财力用于农业生产上，很快地取得了很大的成绩。重视农业是正确的。但是，他们把农业和副业对立起来，埋头发展农业，有意无意地把副业放松了。副业衰落的主要原因就在这里。
    在过渡时期，以至今后若干世代当中，副业都是支援农业生产，增加农民收入，满足城乡人民需要和供应某些出口物资的重要生产部门。目前许多地区由于副业衰落而造成的经济死滞的现象，难道不是最有力地证明了副业的重要吗？社会不能只有农业没有副业，正像人不能只吃粮食不吃副食一样。因此，衡量一个合作社的成绩，不仅要看农业生产发展了没有，而且要看副业生产发展了没有；不仅要看合作社是否增加了公共积累，而且要看每个社员是否增加了实际收入。抓住农业放松副业，会给国家和人民造成重大的损失，这种例子是很多的。湖北麻城县牛卷鼻乡有四个合作社（共计368户），农业生产逐年发展。1948年，它们的农业收入是二万四千多元，1951年增加到三万五千多元，1953年增加到四万一千多元，1955年增加到五万四千多元。农业生产几年当中增加一倍多，速度可以说是很快的了！但是，看看它们的副业收入吧！1948年是四万二千多元，1951年降到二万八千多元，1953年又降到二万六千多元，1955年更降到一万四千多元。把农业和副业收入合并计算，几年当中的收入几乎完全一样。农民的总收入没有增加，某些半劳动力没有活儿干，农业生产的进一步发展受到很大的限制。忽视副业造成的严重后果，不是很应该发人深省吗？
    我国农村中到处都有广泛开展副业生产的良好条件，只要很好地加以利用，农村副业就会迅速发展起来。河北霸县胜芳镇有二十一个合作社，从今年二月到四月，从事捕鱼、编织等副业活动，收入七十多万元。各个合作社已把五十多万元预分给社员，用其余的二十多万元购买肥料、农药、动力机械等等。这二十一个合作社的副业收入，到年底估计可有三百三十多万元，每户分得三百五十多元，相当三千多斤粮食，约合十亩中等田地的收入。
    在农业合作化以前，农民从事副业生产，多是利用十冬腊月、春节前后和农事空隙时间。那时候，农民是完全不去计算副业生产的劳动成本的。现在许多合作社定出了较高的劳动日报酬，对副业生产的报酬定的却比较低。社员为了多得报酬，社的干部为了显示劳动日报酬较高的“优越性”，都是集中力量于农业，把副业生产放松了。这种作法是片面的，因此是错误的。湖南长沙县九木农业社算过一笔细账，彻底解决了这个问题。这个社共有460户，如果仅仅进行农业生产，每个劳动日的报酬可有1.5元，但每个劳动力全年只能工作163天，收入244.5元。这样，全社37.8％的劳动力没有事干，某些社员的收入将要减少。如果把副业发展起来，每个劳动力全年可以工作247天，农副业统一分配，每个劳动日的报酬虽然只有1.3元，但每个劳动力全年的总收入却有321.1元。是不管总收入的多寡，片面追求每个劳动日的高额报酬好呢？还是实行多种经营，帮助农民增加总收入好呢？九木合作社的例子告诉我们，为了解决这个问题，必须确定农副业报酬的适当比例，使从事农副业生产的社员都不吃亏，并且给予技术高的社员适当的物质鼓励。
    农民经营的副业都是很分散的。这种副业适合小农经济的状况，千百年来，排除各种困难和阻碍，一直存在和不断发展着。实现农业合作化以后，许多农业生产合作社把大型副业收归社营，但是由于缺乏经验，许多合作社的大型副业还没有办好。另一方面，许多合作社制定的劳动规划标准偏高，留给社员个人的时间太少，农民的家庭副业受了时间限制，也就逐渐衰落了。
    农村副业千门万种，经营方式应该多种多样。大型副业宜于合作社集体经营，合作社要订出全面规划，集中力量把它办好。有些副业宜于生产队、生产组经营，应该及时分给它们，充分发挥它们的积极性。多数零星副业宜于社员个人经营，绝对不要勉强集中起来，形成合作社的“包而不办”。要社员经营家庭副业，必须给他们留下必要的时间，并且在原料、销路等方面，给以必要的帮助和指导。中共甘肃省委决定合作社每年给社员留出六十天到一百天，山西省委决定合作社每年给社员留出两个月，作家庭副业和其他个人活动，都是很必要的措施。
    现在许多省区的党政领导机关，正在逐步加强副业生产的领导。它们确实抓住解决副业问题的关键了。只有加强领导，才能帮助合作社作出全面的规划，解决副业生产中原料供应、产品推销、技术指导等问题，避免和克服大发展过程中可能产生的盲目性。中共江苏省委已经决定：地委、县委的生产合作部要有一个副部长专管副业生产，农业生产合作社要有一个副社长专管副业生产。广东新会县已经成立了包括党政领导机关和财经部门的发展农村副业的办公室，具体领导这一工作。这种保证执行正确方针的组织措施，各个地区都是应该适当采用的。
    在插秧、播种以后，各个地区都有一段农事间隙。各个地区的党政领导机关，应该利用这个时机，采用一切可行的办法，把停滞了的副业生产恢复起来。谁真正注意了这个问题，谁就能够想出好的办法，就像前面举的那些事例一样。
