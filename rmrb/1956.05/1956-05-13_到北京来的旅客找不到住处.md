    Travelers Arriving in Beijing Cannot Find Accommodation

    I came to Beijing for work and got off the train at Beijing Qianmen Station late at night on March 27th. I asked at the station service desk about hotels, and the answer I received was: not to mention hotels, even small inns and big cart houses are full.

    Although it was late at night, the square in front of Qianmen Station was still bustling and noisy. Rickshaw pullers were soliciting customers, but many travelers asked the rickshaw pullers to find hotels for them. Most rickshaw pullers shook their heads and said, "That's not certain." Therefore, I had to carry my luggage myself to find a hotel. Starting from Qianmen Street, I walked all over Damochang, Xianyukou, Langfang Toutiao, Zhushikou, Meishi Street, and many small alleys that I couldn't name, but the result was still disappointment. The big and small hotels and inns in these places, without exception, had "Full" signs hanging up. So, I had to drag my heavy steps back to Qianmen Station. In the waiting room of the station, the people who left the station with me to find accommodation met here again. Everyone smiled wryly at each other and said in unison: "There's really no way!"

    Among us who couldn't find accommodation were soldiers, government employees, etc. Guests coming to Beijing cannot find accommodation, which is a matter that should be taken seriously by the relevant departments in Beijing!

    到北京来的旅客找不到住处编辑同志：
    我因为有工作到北京来，三月二十七日深夜，在北京前门车站下了火车。我到车站服务处打听那里有旅馆，得到的答复是：不要说旅馆，就是小客栈、大车店都客满了。
    尽管夜已深了，但是前门车站门前的广场上还是熙熙攘攘，人声嘈杂。三轮车工人在招揽顾主，但是不少旅客都要求三轮车工人能代为找寻旅馆。大部分三轮工人都摇头说“这可没准儿”。因此，我只好自己提起行李去找旅馆了。从前门大街开始，我走遍了打磨厂、鲜鱼口、廊坊头条、珠市口、煤市街和许多我叫不出名的小胡同，可是，得到的结果仍是失望。这些地方大大小小的旅馆和客栈，毫无例外地都挂着“客满”的牌子。于是，我只好拖着沉重的步履又回到前门车站。在车站的候车室里，同我一起离开车站去找住处的人又在这儿会师了。大家相对苦笑了一下，异口同声地说：“真是没有办法！”
    在我们这些找不着住处的人中，有军人、机关工作人员等。来到北京的客人，找不到住处，这是一件值得北京市有关部门引起重视的事情啊！
