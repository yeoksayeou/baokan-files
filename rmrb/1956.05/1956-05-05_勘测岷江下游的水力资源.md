    Surveying Hydropower Resources of the Lower Min River
    To coordinate with the Yangtze River water conservancy planning, the comprehensive utilization survey of water conservancy in the lower reaches of the Min River in Sichuan Province has begun. The Min River Lower Reaches Survey Brigade, organized by the Chengdu Hydroelectric Power Survey and Design Bureau, has recently completed the topographic survey from Jiangkou in Pengshan County to the territory of Qianwei County. The survey work is being carried out under the specific guidance of Soviet experts. In order to complete the survey of the lower reaches of the Min River, the Chengdu Hydroelectric Power Survey and Design Bureau has held various professional training courses in Guankou for surveying, geology, drilling, hydrology, etc., to train junior technicians. More than 100 personnel from the Longxi River Survey Team, who participated in the construction of the Shizitan Hydropower Station, have arrived at the construction site to support the survey of the lower reaches of the Min River. They are now conducting surveying. Comprehensive topographic surveying and geological drilling will soon begin. (Li Zhongpu)

    勘测岷江下游的水力资源
    为了配合长江水利规划，四川省岷江下游水利综合利用勘测工作已经开始。由成都水力发电勘测设计局组织的岷江下游勘测大队，最近已经完成从彭山县江口到犍为县境内所进行的地形勘测。勘测工作在苏联专家的具体指导下进行。为了完成岷江下游的勘测工作，成都水力发电勘测设计局在灌县举办了测量、地质、钻探、水文等各种专业训练班，培养初级技术人员。曾经参加狮子滩水电站建设的龙溪河测量队人员一百多人，已到工地，支援勘测岷江下游，他们现在正进行测量。全面的地形测量和地质钻探即将展开。　（李中璞）
