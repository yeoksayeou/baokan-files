Xinhua News Agency, 23rd dispatch: Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and Shanghai, which account for more than 90% of the country's silk and satin production, will add 68 new varieties and 1,860 new patterns this year.

In recent years, China's silk industry has been rapidly restored and developed. The output of silk and satin in 1955 increased by 176% compared with 1950. However, the varieties, patterns, and dyeing fastness of silk and satin produced by various factories at present cannot fully meet the requirements of domestic and foreign consumers. In the future, we will further draw on China's rich and colorful national art traditions, absorb the characteristics of new foreign varieties and patterns, and make the specifications of variety design beautiful, practical, and economical.

    我国绸缎的品种花样今年将大为增加
    据新华社23日讯　占全国绸缎生产量90％以上的江苏、浙江两省和上海市，今年要增加六十八种新品种，一千八百六十种新花样。
    几年来，我国丝绸工业得到了迅速的恢复和发展。绸缎的产量，1955年比1950年增长了176％。但目前各厂生产的绸缎品种、花样、印染牢度，还不能完全满足国内外消费者的要求。今后将进一步根据我国丰富多采的民族艺术传统，吸取国外新品种、花样的特点，使品种设计的规格做到美观、实用、经济。
