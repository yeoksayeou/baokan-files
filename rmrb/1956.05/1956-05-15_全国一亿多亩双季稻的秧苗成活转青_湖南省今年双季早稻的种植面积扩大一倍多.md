Xinhua News Agency, 14th Dispatch: The transplanting of early double-cropping rice on over 100 million mu of land throughout the country has been completed. Currently, seedlings in various regions have taken root and turned green, exhibiting healthy growth.

Of the over 100 million mu of early double-cropping rice, more than 30 million mu represent newly expanded planting areas this year.

This figure for the expanded double-cropping rice area is four times greater than the expansion during the same period last year. Calculated at an increase of 200 jin of rice per mu of double-cropping rice, the newly expanded 30 million mu of double-cropping rice will contribute an additional 6 billion jin of grain to the nation.

Large-scale changes to the farming system require more labor and fertilizer, as well as improvements to existing irrigation facilities or the construction of new farmland water conservancy projects. This was impossible in the past. Due to the development of agricultural cooperativization, the relations of production in the small-peasant economy have been transformed, enabling the rational utilization of dispersed labor and financial resources in the vast countryside. This has also stimulated the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers, extensively tapping production potential and increasing labor utilization rates. This has created the conditions for large-scale changes in the farming system.

To ensure increased production and adapt to the needs of the changing farming system, farmers in various regions generally advanced the time of transplanting early double-cropping rice by seven to fifteen days compared to last year. They also applied sufficient base fertilizer in advance and widely promoted advanced experiences such as shallow transplanting of young seedlings, uniform transplanting, and rational close planting. Agricultural technology extension stations in rice-growing areas also helped agricultural cooperatives train many key personnel in close-planting techniques. During transplanting, agricultural production cooperatives in various regions carried out labor competitions between societies and teams. As a result of the above work, the progress of early rice transplanting this year has been rapid and of high quality.

Currently, in all areas where early rice transplanting has been completed, field management work has been strengthened. Some areas are also actively preparing for weeding and topdressing fertilizer.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 14th Dispatch: Hunan Province, one of the main rice-producing areas, has planted over 14 million mu of early rice this year, the vast majority of which is early rice for double-cropping.

These early rice crops have all achieved close planting with row and plant spacing of seven or eight inches, planting two to three thousand more seedlings per mu than last year. Furthermore, they are all high-quality varieties such as "Southern Special No." and "Red Foot." In areas with suitable climate and soil conditions, japonica rice is also being trial-planted for the first time. Currently, members of agricultural production cooperatives in various regions are carrying out mid-season cultivation, weeding, and topdressing fertilizer in the early rice fields.

Last year, Hunan Province had only over 5 million mu of double-cropping rice. This year, it is planned to increase by more than double compared to last year. The areas planting double-cropping rice are mainly located in the Dongting Lake Plain and the Xiangjiang River Basin, where water conservancy conditions are better. Generally, each mu of double-cropping rice can yield two to three hundred jin more than single-cropping rice.

    全国一亿多亩双季稻的秧苗成活转青
    湖南省今年双季早稻的种植面积扩大一倍多
    新华社14日讯　全国一万万多亩双季稻早稻插秧工作已经结束。现在各地秧苗都成活转青，生长良好。
    一万万多亩双季稻早稻中，有三千多万亩是今年新扩大的种植面积。
    今年扩大的双季稻种植面积的这个数字，比去年同期扩大的数字增加了四倍，如以每亩双季稻增产二百斤稻谷计算，今年新扩大的三千余万亩双季稻将为国家增产六十亿斤粮食。
    大规模的改变耕作制度，需要较多的劳动力和肥料，也需要改善原来的灌溉设施或增修新的农田水利工程。这在过去是办不到的。由于农业合作化的发展，改变了小农经济的生产关系，使广大农村分散的劳力和财力得到合理使用，同时也激发了广大农民的生产积极性，广泛地挖掘了生产潜力，提高了劳动利用率。这就为大规模改变耕作制度创造了条件。
    各地农民为保证增产和适应改变耕作制度的需要，今年双季早稻插秧的时间一般都比去年提早七天到十五天；并且事先大都施足了基肥，还普遍推广了嫩秧浅插、匀插和合理密植等先进经验。水稻地区的农业技术推广站还帮助农业社训练了许多密植插秧的骨干。在插秧中，各地农业生产合作社开展了社与社、队与队之间的劳动竞赛。由于进行了以上工作，因此，今年早稻插秧进度快、质量好。
    目前，在所有完成早稻插秧的地区，已开始加强田间管理工作。有些地区还在积极准备耘田追肥。
    新华社长沙14日电　主要水稻产区之一的湖南省，今年种植的一千四百多万亩早稻，绝大部分是双季稻的早稻。
    这些早稻都达到行、株距离七寸或八寸的密植，每亩比去年多栽了二千到三千蔸；并且都是“南特号”、“红脚”等良种。在气候、土质适宜的地区，还第一次试种了粳稻。现在各地农业生产合作社的社员正在早稻田里进行中耕除草和追肥工作。
    湖南省去年双季稻还只有五百多万亩，今年计划比去年增加一倍多。种植双季稻的地区主要是在水利条件较好的洞庭湖滨平原和湘江流域。一般每亩双季稻可以比单季稻多收二百斤到三百斤。
