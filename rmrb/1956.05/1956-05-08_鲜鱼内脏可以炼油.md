To the Editor:

    Every year in our country, a large quantity of fresh fish is processed for pickling and drying, and during this processing, most of the fish viscera are discarded. In fact, fish viscera contain a lot of oil, which can be refined and used to make soap, leather, coatings, etc., and can also be used as lamp oil in rural areas. Fish oil can also be used as edible oil after high-temperature refining, and the cost is lower than other animal oils. One hundred catties of fresh fish viscera can generally extract one catty of fish oil (at least ten taels, at most two catties). The Hubei Honghu County Aquatic Products Company used fish viscera to produce oil and obtained more than 20,000 catties of fish oil last year.

    I hope that aquatic products departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions will organize production in this area so that fish viscera can be fully utilized.

### 鲜鱼内脏可以炼油

    鲜鱼内脏可以炼油
　　编辑同志：
    我国每年有大量鲜鱼进行腌干复制，在加工的时候大部分鱼内脏都被抛弃了。实际上，鱼内脏含有很多油脂，可以炼油，用来制肥皂、制革、制涂料等，也可以作为农村点灯用油。鱼油油脂经过高温精制后还可以作食用油，成本比其它动物油要低。一百斤鲜鱼所取出的内脏一般可以提炼一斤鱼油（最少十两，最多二斤）。湖北省洪湖县水产公司利用鱼内脏制油，在去年一年中得到了二万多斤鱼油。
    我希望各地水产部门和供销社组织这方面的生产，使鱼内脏能够得到充分的利用。  萧希勇
