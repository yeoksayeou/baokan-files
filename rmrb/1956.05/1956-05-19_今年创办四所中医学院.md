Xinhua News Agency, 18th: This year, China will establish four colleges of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).

The four newly established colleges of TCM are: Beijing College of TCM, Shanghai College of TCM, Guangzhou College of TCM, and Chengdu College of TCM.

At a preparatory symposium for the new TCM colleges held by the Ministry of Health from the 16th to the 17th, representatives from the health departments and bureaus of Guangdong, Sichuan, Beijing, Shanghai, and other provinces and cities involved in the preparations agreed that each of the four TCM colleges would enroll 120 students this summer.

These four TCM colleges will all be five-year institutions, training students to become senior TCM professionals proficient in TCM academic knowledge and medical techniques. After graduation, students will be assigned by the state to teaching, research, or medical work.

In addition to recruiting high school graduates, TCM colleges will also recruit a portion of young TCM practitioners with a high school Chinese language proficiency, on-the-job health cadres, and outstanding graduates from secondary medical schools. The examination subjects will be conducted according to the subjects stipulated for higher medical institutions. On-the-job health cadres who have worked for more than three years will enjoy the benefits of a transfer cadre allowance, while other students will be generally provided with people's scholarships in accordance with the standards for higher normal school students.
