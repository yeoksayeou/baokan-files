    More and More People Support Vietnam's National Reunification
    The Cao Đài Pope of South Vietnam Sends a Telegram to Ho Chi Minh Welcoming the Peaceful Reunification of the Motherland
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 19th. According to an announcement here today, the Cao Đài Pope of South Vietnam, Phạm Công Tắc, once sent a telegram to President Ho Chi Minh, expressing his welcome for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam government's proposition to reunify Vietnam by peaceful means.
    Phạm Công Tắc sent this telegram from Phnom Penh on April 26th. After Ngô Đình Diệm's troops occupied the Cao Đài center of Tây Ninh in February of this year, the Pope was forced to reside in Cambodia.
    In his telegram to Ho Chi Minh, Phạm Công Tắc said, "We, representing millions of Cao Đài followers, express to you our heartfelt gratitude because you have shown the best will for a peaceful resolution to the reunification of Vietnam. We earnestly hope that your two governments (referring to the authorities of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the South Vietnam authorities) will ensure that all democratic freedoms are effectively implemented for the happiness of all people who deeply desire peace and unity; and that complete understanding will be reached."
