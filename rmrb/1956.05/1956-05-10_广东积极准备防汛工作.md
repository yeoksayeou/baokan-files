Guangdong Actively Prepares for Flood Prevention

    In order to do a good job in flood prevention preparation and ensure the safety of embankments, the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee recently issued instructions on flood prevention work. The instructions stated: In the main grain-producing areas of Guangdong Province, there are more than ten million mu of paddy fields with relatively good soil quality and high yields, as well as land for growing cash crops, which are threatened to varying degrees by floods on both sides of the rivers. Therefore, overcoming floods and safely passing the flood season is an important guarantee for completing this year's agricultural production increase plan. The instructions require that in order to do a good job in preparing to overcome floods, all special districts and flood prevention counties should hold a flood prevention meeting to check the thinking of cadres, check and summarize the implementation of the embankment annual repair project plan from last winter to this spring, convey the decisions of the Provincial Flood Prevention Work Conference, and concretely and specifically arrange this year's flood prevention work.
    Before mid-May, under the leadership of party and government organs at all levels, flood prevention agencies and water conservancy departments at all levels should organize the masses and cadres of agricultural production cooperatives to conduct an on-site inspection of all large and small embankments and culverts, checking embankment culvert equipment, material storage and management, the organization and training of flood fighting and rescue teams, etc., and immediately solve any problems found on the spot. Furthermore, in conjunction with the inspection, overcome the paralysis of cadres. Special attention should be paid to places where rivers were blocked and water diverted by breaching embankments during the drought resistance effort. The demolition of river-blocking foundation dams must ensure the restoration of the original river depth, so as not to increase the water level and cause disasters. The patching of breached embankments must also ensure that the quality meets the standards, and sufficient reserves of Taiping soil, sand, and stone should be stored in those places so that timely rescue and treatment can be carried out when danger occurs. All large and small embankments that have not established management and maintenance organizations should establish management and maintenance organizations in May. Those that have already been established should be rectified and consolidated in conjunction with flood prevention work.

　　广东积极准备防汛工作
    为了做好防汛准备工作，确保围堤的安全，广东省人民委员会最近发出关于防汛工作的指示。指示说：广东省主要产粮区有一千多万亩土质比较好、产量比较高的稻田和种植经济作物的土地，在各江河两岸，受着洪水不同程度的威胁；因此，战胜洪水，安全渡过汛期，是完成今年农业增产计划的重要保证。指示要求为了做好战胜洪水的各项准备工作，各专区各防汛县一律应当召开一次防汛会议，检查干部的思想，检查和总结去冬今春堤防岁修工程计划执行的情况，传达省防汛工作会议的决定，并且切实地具体地布置今年的防汛工作。
    五月中旬以前，在各级党、政机关领导下，由各级防汛机构和水利部门组织群众和农业生产合作社干部，到现场对所有大小堤围涵闸进行一次检查，检查堤围涵闸设备、器材储蓄和保管、防汛抢险队伍的组织和训练等等，就地发现问题，就地立即解决；并且结合检查，克服干部的麻痹思想。检查中应当特别注意抗旱中封江堵河和破堤引水的地方。对拦河基坝的拆除，务必做到恢复原来河道深度，以免涌高水位造成灾害；破缺堤围的堵复，也务必做到质量合乎标准，而且应当在那些地方多贮备太平土、沙、石，以便在险象发生的时候，能够及时抢救、处理。所有大小堤围，凡是没有成立管养机构的，应当在五月内一律成立管养机构；已经成立的，应当结合防汛工作，加以整顿巩固。
