Beidaihe Spruces Up to Welcome Summer Guests
Xinhua

In May, Beidaihe, China's famous summer resort, is a verdant expanse with a profusion of blooming flowers. From a distance, the red rooftops and white walls of the sanatoriums and rest homes are faintly visible amidst the dense green foliage, creating a particularly fresh and beautiful scene.

Most of the sanatoriums and rest home buildings built on the hillsides and along the coast have been renovated, with the doors and windows and walls that have weathered the wind and sun for a year being repainted and refreshed. By the beginning of May, more than six hundred houses had been renovated. The interior and exterior furnishings and decorations have also been cleaned up. In more than twenty larger sanatoriums, such as the "Chinese Coal Miners Sanatorium," the two hundred varieties of flowers, numbering twenty thousand pots, stored in the greenhouses have long been placed in the halls, dining rooms, lounges, music rooms, and corridors. Various woody flowers are also competing to show their beauty, and their alluring fragrance can be smelled from afar. The grounds inside and outside many sanatoriums, and along the roads, are covered with lush flowering plants.

This year, Beidaihe District has added many new facilities for its guests. A new slaughterhouse has been built to ensure that guests can regularly eat fresh and clean pork. The Beidaihe Trading Company's summer supply station has also built a new warehouse with cold storage equipment, guaranteeing that guests can enjoy fresh meat at any time. There is also a place for various cooked foods, where different cooked foods can be stored separately to maintain their original unique flavors. A new food store is also being built in Dongshan and will be completed by the end of May, providing summer visitors with a variety of palatable pastries, candies, and fruits.

The people of Beidaihe District are enthusiastically welcoming the arrival of guests. The members of the agricultural and fishery production cooperatives say: "We will produce more vegetables and fruits, and catch more plump and delicious fish, to supply the recuperating personnel and international friends from all over the country and from all ethnic groups." By the beginning of May, the eight townships in the district had planted more than 300 mu of small spinach, small cucumbers, and other vegetables, and more than 400 mu of melons and watermelons, for summer and recuperating personnel. In the state-owned farm's more than 600 mu of orchards, workers are busily pruning and spraying pesticides. According to a comrade from the farm, they will harvest 400,000 to 500,000 jin of apples, plums, peaches, and grapes this year to meet the needs of summer visitors and recuperating personnel.

    北戴河盛装迎候避暑的客人
    新华
    五月，我国著名避暑胜地北戴河，一片葱绿，百花盛开。远远望去，浓绿的丛林中隐隐地露出红色的楼顶，白色的墙壁，显得格外清新美丽。
    建筑在山坡和海岸上的疗养院、休养所的楼房，大部分又都修整了一遍，把经过风吹日晒了一年的门窗墙壁，重新涂饰粉刷一新。到五月初，已经有六百多所房屋修饰完毕。室内外的陈设和点缀物，也都收拾得干干净净。“中国煤矿工人疗养院”等二十多个较大的疗养院，存放在花窖里的二百多种的两万盆花，也早已摆在了大厅、餐厅、休息室、音乐室和走廊。各种木本花，也正在媲美争妍，从老远就可闻见诱人的芳香。许多疗养院的院内院外，道路两旁，长满了茂密的草花。
    今年，北戴河区又为客人们增添了许多新的设备。为使客人们经常吃到新鲜洁净的猪肉，新修了一个屠宰场。北戴河贸易公司暑期供应站还新盖了一个仓库，里边有冷藏设备，可以保证客人随时吃到鲜美的肉类食物；还有盛各种熟食品的地方，可以把各种不同的熟食品分别存放起来，使它们保持原来特有的味道。在东山，还新建一所食品门市部，五月底就可以完工，它将以各种各样的适口的糕点、糖果和水果等供应避暑的人们。
    北戴河区的人们，正在满腔热情地迎接客人们的到来。农渔业生产合作社的社员们说：“我们要生产更多的蔬菜和瓜果，捕捉更多的肥美的鲜鱼，供给来自祖国各地各族的休养人员和国际友人。到五月初，全区八个乡已为避暑和疗养人员种上三百多亩小菠菜、小黄瓜等蔬菜，四百多亩甜瓜和西瓜。国营农场的六百多亩果园，工人们正在紧张地修枝喷药。据农场的一个同志说，他们今年要收四、五十万斤苹果、李子、蜜桃和葡萄等，以满足避暑和疗养人们的需要。
