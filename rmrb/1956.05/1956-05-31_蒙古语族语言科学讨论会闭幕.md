Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, May 30th: The Mongolian Language Family Scientific Symposium, which concluded yesterday, passed a resolution stating that the conference holds significant importance for the development of the languages and scripts of the Mongolian language family and for promoting the cultural endeavors of the various ethnic groups within the Mongolian language family.

The conference commenced on the 22nd in Hohhot. During the conference, representatives from various ethnic groups from different regions engaged in discussions regarding the script reform of the Mongolian language family, the promotion of the New Mongolian script, or the creation of scripts. Everyone concurred that, based on the experiences of the Mongolian people in China over the past few years using the New Mongolian script, and considering the dialects of the Mongolian people in various regions, the policy of promoting the New Mongolian script to develop a common national standard language and implementing the decision of the People's Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region regarding the promotion of the New Mongolian script is correct. The conference believes that the New Mongolian script can accurately express the language, is easy to learn, and is also beneficial for the cultural exchange between China and Mongolia.

The conference also discussed and studied the issue of creating a script for the Daur ethnic group, concluding that the Daur ethnic group should create a script. A consensus was also reached on adopting the Butha dialect as the basic dialect and using the Russian alphabet as the letter form.

The conference also exchanged views on the language situations of the Dongxiang, Bonan, and Tu ethnic groups within the Mongolian language family. Further investigations and studies will be conducted on the issue of creating scripts for these ethnic groups.

    蒙古语族语言科学讨论会闭幕
    据新华社呼和浩特30日电　昨天闭会的蒙古语族语言科学讨论会，作出决议说：这次会议对发展蒙古语族的语言文字，对推进蒙古语族中各民族文化事业的发展，有重大意义。
    会议是二十二日在呼和浩特召开的。会议期间，来自各地的各民族代表，对蒙古语族的文字改革，推行新蒙文或创立文字的问题，进行了讨论，大家认为根据我国蒙古族人民几年来使用新蒙文的情况，和各地蒙古族的方言情况来看，采取推行新蒙文以发展民族共同标准语的方针，和执行内蒙古自治区人民委员会关于推行新蒙文的决定是正确的。会议认为新蒙文能正确表达语言，容易学习，对交流中国和蒙古两国的文化也有好处。
    这次会议还讨论研究了达呼尔族创立文字的问题，认为达呼尔族应创立文字，对采用布特哈土语为基础方言，采取俄文字母为字母形式也取得了一致的意见。
    会议对于蒙古语族中东乡、保安和土族的语言情况，也交换了意见，对于这些民族创立文字的问题，要进一步进行调查研究。
