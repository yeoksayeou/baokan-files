    Merely a "Tobacco and Sugar Trade Issue"?
    Xiao Guang
    The dispute between the United States and the Philippines over tobacco and sugar trade issues has been going on for a long time, but has not yet been resolved.
    At the beginning of this year, the Philippines rejected a proposal by the United States to sell 15 million pounds of surplus Virginia tobacco to the Philippines. The Philippines' rejection was because it could already produce enough tobacco to meet domestic needs. However, this very reasonable measure by the Philippines aroused dissatisfaction and retaliation from the United States. U.S. Congressman Cooley immediately proposed in the U.S. Congress that unless the Philippines abandons its restrictions on U.S. tobacco leaf imports, the U.S. should restrict Philippine sugar imports. Subsequently, the U.S. Congress passed a bill to increase the quota for sugar imports. This bill stipulates that from 1957 to 1962, the United States will increase its sugar imports from Mexico, Peru, and many other countries in order to combat the development of sugar production in the Philippines.
    The retaliatory actions of the United States cannot but arouse widespread indignation among the Philippine public. Manila Mayor Lacson said that the American approach "makes it very easy to think of the painful lessons of history, recalling those years when the Americans, with the grand dream of building an empire, wanted to forcibly merge the Philippines in 1898." Former Chairman of the Philippine National Economic Council, Montelibano, accused the United States of basing its economic policy towards the Philippines "on the greed of American imperialists, hoping to keep it forever in a state of economic slavery."
    The anti-American voices are getting louder and louder, and the criticism has crossed party lines; with the unreasonable arrest of the Tarlac mine owner by the U.S. military authorities, it has quickly developed into a movement demanding a change in U.S.-Philippine relations. This reflects the long-standing sentiment of the Philippine public to get rid of U.S. economic control.
    U.S. control of the Philippine economy has seriously damaged the economic life of the Philippine people.
    Before Philippine independence, it was completely controlled and enslaved by the United States economically. At that time, the Philippine constitution openly stipulated that the United States had the privilege of exploiting Philippine minerals and all natural wealth, as well as investing in public utility enterprises. When the Philippines became independent in 1946, the United States used the Bell Trade Act (now the Laurel-Langley Agreement) as a condition for recognizing its independence, continuing to fix various U.S. privileges in the Philippines in legal form. The United States has a direct investment of approximately 300 to 400 million U.S. dollars (calculated at pre-war prices) in the Philippines. This capital monopolizes various aspects of the Philippines, such as the raw material processing industry, the mining industry, transportation, and public utilities. U.S. capital also controls the Philippines' financial affairs through Citibank, General Bank, and trading companies, thereby controlling the entire industry of the Philippines.
    The Bell Trade Act deprived the Philippines of the right to manage its own foreign trade and tariffs. As a result of U.S. control of Philippine foreign trade, U.S.-Philippine trade accounts for 60%-70% of the Philippines' total foreign trade, with an annual trade volume of billions of pesos, resulting in a huge trade deficit for the Philippines. For example, in 1954, the Philippines' trade deficit with the United States was more than 7 million pesos more than the total trade deficit; the Philippines had to rely on trade surpluses with other countries to make up for part of the trade deficit with the United States. Since the signing of the Bell Trade Agreement in 1946 until January 1956, the total trade deficit in the Philippines has reached more than 3.4 billion pesos. This has made the Philippines' foreign exchange reserves, which mainly rely on exporting goods to earn foreign exchange, increasingly depleted.
    In terms of industrial and agricultural production, the Philippines has also failed to get rid of U.S. control and obtain autonomy. The Philippines is an agricultural country. It has a tropical oceanic climate and can grow a wide variety of crops. However, the Philippine people cannot produce according to their own needs. The United States treats the Philippines as an appendage to supply agricultural raw materials to U.S. industry, reducing the production of rice, which the Philippine people rely on for survival, to expand the production of raw materials needed by the United States: sugarcane, coconut, and Manila hemp. The export of these three agricultural products accounts for more than 70% to 80% of the Philippines' total exports, but the Philippines has to import large amounts of rice, the staple food of the people, with U.S. dollars.
    In order to ensure that the Philippines becomes a favorable market for it to sell industrial products, the United States does not allow the Philippines to develop its own industry. It hinders the Philippines from importing industrial machinery and equipment. In 1953, out of the 914 million pesos of goods imported by the Philippines, only 59 million pesos were for machinery, accounting for about 6%. U.S. capitalists plunder the raw materials of the Philippines and mostly transport them to the United States for processing. The Philippines only has some industries, which cannot withstand the fierce squeeze of U.S. commodities, and most of them are on the verge of collapse. The Philippines was originally a world-famous producer of Luzon cigars, but now it has become the world's largest dumping market for American tobacco. According to U.S. customs records, in 1954, the value of U.S. exports of tobacco products to the Philippines was more than 13.9 million U.S. dollars, which is equal to 2.76 times the value of Philippine tobacco and tobacco product exports in the same year.
    The Philippines has very rich mineral resources, but only 0.04% of the area has been mined. The output of the main mineral, gold, in 1954 was 450,000 ounces, less than one-third of that in 1941. At present, the total output value of Philippine industry accounts for only about 10% of the total national economy.
    U.S. capitalists take advantage of the nature of Philippine agriculture as a single crop and the backwardness of industry to vigorously depress the prices of Philippine export raw materials and raise the prices of U.S. industrial products to make huge profits. In 1955, the quantity of Philippine raw material exports increased, but the income decreased; the reason was the unreasonable price reduction by the United States: the price of copra was reduced by 13.9%, coconut oil was reduced by 12.4%, and sugar was reduced by 7.9%. At the same time, the United States is promoting goods in the Philippines at high prices. It exports food—bread, fish, dairy products, meat—to the Philippines at three times the price; and exports steel at three to three and seven-tenths times the price. American fertilizer sells for 45 pesos per ton in the Philippines, but it only costs 7 pesos to manufacture it in the Philippines.
    U.S. monopoly capital extracts huge profits from the Philippines every year and remits them back to the United States tax-free. According to statistics, U.S. monopoly capital plundered a total of 381 million pesos in profits in 1949 alone, which is equal to 73% of the total value of Philippine exports in the same year.
    It is becoming increasingly clear that as a result of the shackles of the Bell Trade Agreement and one-sided dependence on the United States, the Philippine economy has suffered huge damage. With the intensification of the struggle for markets throughout the capitalist world and the development of factors in the U.S. economic crisis, the economic situation in the Philippines has further deteriorated. In this situation, more and more people are demanding that the Philippines get rid of U.S. shackles and implement a truly independent foreign policy. Many members of Congress believe that it is necessary to widely develop trade with democratic camp countries and other Asian and African countries, which will not only expand the Philippines' foreign market, but also "open up a path to economically save the country." On March 10 this year, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Philippine House of Representatives passed a resolution requesting a re-examination of the Philippines' foreign policy to make the Philippines less dependent on the United States. The resolution pointed out that "the Philippines is an Eastern country" and said that "if the Philippines reduces its dependence on the West and establishes and develops its relations with neighboring countries, then this will be in the best interests of the Philippines."
    Now, the movement in the Philippines demanding a change in U.S.-Philippine relations is expanding. "The Manila Chronicle" stated: "Only when the United States stops treating the Philippines as a colony will the current criticism of the United States' actions in the Philippines stop." Many Philippine newspapers pointed out that if the United States still thinks this is just "the aftermath" of "a mere tobacco and sugar trade issue," it would be a big mistake.

    仅仅是“烟草和糖的贸易问题”吗？
    萧光
    美国和菲律宾关于烟草和糖的贸易问题的争执，已经发生很久了，但是至今没有得到解决。
    今年年初，菲律宾拒绝了美国提出的要把一千五百万磅弗吉尼亚的剩余烟草卖给菲律宾的建议。菲律宾的拒绝，是因为它自己已能生产足够的烟草供应国内的需要。但是，菲律宾这个十分合理的措施，却引起了美国的不满和报复。美国众议员库利立即在美国国会提出：除非菲律宾放弃它对美国烟叶进口的限制，否则美国就要对菲律宾糖进口加以限制。接着，美国国会就通过了一项提高食糖入口限额的法案。这个法案规定，自1957年至1962年，美国将增加从墨西哥、秘鲁等许多国家进口的食糖，以打击菲律宾糖业生产的发展。
    美国的报复行动不能不引起菲律宾公众的普遍愤慨。马尼拉市长拉克森说，美国的做法“使人非常容易想到历史上的惨痛教训，想起美国人怀着建立帝国的堂皇梦想要在1898年用武力合并菲律宾的那些年头”。菲律宾全国经济委员会前主席蒙特利班诺指责美国对菲律宾的经济政策“以美国帝国主义者的贪心为基础，希望这里永远保持一种经济奴隶的生活”。
    反美的呼声越来越响亮，批评越过了党派的界线；随着丹辘矿主被美军当局无理逮捕，很快地发展成要求改变美菲关系的运动。这反映了菲律宾公众长久以来要求摆脱美国经济控制的情绪。
    美国对菲律宾经济的控制，严重地损害了菲律宾人民的经济生活。
    菲律宾独立以前，在经济上完全受美国的控制和奴役。那时菲律宾宪法中就公然规定：美国有开采菲律宾矿产和一切天然财富以及向公用事业企业投资的特权。1946年菲律宾独立时，美国又以贝尔贸易协定（即现在的劳雷尔—朗格莱协定）作为承认它独立的条件，把美国在菲律宾的种种特权继续用法律形式固定下来。美国对菲律宾的直接投资大约有三亿到四亿美元（按战前价格计算）。这些资本垄断了菲律宾的原料加工业、采矿工业、交通运输业以及公用事业等各个方面。美国资本还通过花旗银行、通用银行和贸易公司控制了菲律宾的财政金融，从而控制菲律宾的全部产业。
    贝尔贸易协定剥夺了菲律宾管理自己的对外贸易和关税的权利。美国控制菲律宾对外贸易的结果，美、菲贸易占到菲律宾对外贸易总额的60％—70％，每年贸易额达十几亿比索，使菲律宾形成巨额入超。如1954年菲律宾对美入超比入超总额还多七百多万比索；菲律宾不得不依靠对其他国家的出超来弥补对美国入超的一部分。自从1946年贝尔贸易协定签订以来到1956年1月间，菲律宾入超总额已达三十四亿多比索。这使得主要靠出口货物来换取外汇的菲律宾外汇储备越来越枯竭了。
    在工、农业生产方面，菲律宾也没有摆脱美国的控制，获得自主的权利。菲律宾是一个农业国。它具有热带海洋性气候，可以栽植种类繁多的农作物。但是菲律宾人民却不能按照自己的需要来生产。美国把菲律宾当作为美国工业供应农业原料的附属地，靠缩减菲律宾人赖以活命的大米的生产来扩大美国所需要的原料的生产：甘蔗、椰子和麻（马尼拉麻）。这三种农产品的输出，占菲律宾输出总额的百分之七十几到百分之八十以上，但菲律宾却要以大量美元输入人民的主食大米。
    美国为了保证菲律宾成为它推销工业品的有利市场，不许可菲律宾发展自己的工业。它阻碍菲律宾输入工业用的机器设备。1953年，菲律宾输入九亿一千四百万比索的货物中，机器只有五千九百万比索，约占6％。美国资本家掠夺菲律宾的原料，大都运到美国去加工。菲律宾仅有的一些工业，经不起美国商品的凶恶排挤，大都陷于奄奄一息。菲律宾原是世界有名的吕宋烟的产地，现在却成了美国烟草在世界上最大的倾销市场。据美国海关册统计，1954年，美国对菲输出烟制品价值一千三百九十多万美元，等于同年菲律宾烟草和烟制品出口的2.76倍。
    菲律宾矿产资源非常丰富，但已开采的地区仅占0.04％。主要矿产金矿的开采量1954年是四十五万英两，不到1941年的三分之一。目前，菲律宾工业的生产总值，仅占国民经济总产量的10％左右。
    美国资本家利用菲律宾农业的单种作物的性质和工业的落后，极力压低菲律宾出口原料的价格，抬高美国工业品的价格而大发横财。1955年，菲律宾原料出口品的数量增加了，收入反而减少；原因就是美国的无理压价：椰干的价格被降低了13.9％，椰油降低12.4％，糖降低7.9％。同时，美国在菲律宾高价推销商品，它以三倍的价钱向菲律宾输出食品——面包、鱼类、乳品、肉类；以三倍到三点七倍的价钱输出钢材。美国肥田粉在菲律宾售价每吨四十五比索，但如果在菲律宾制造只要七个比索就够了。
    美国垄断资本每年都从菲律宾榨取巨额利润，免税汇回美国。据统计，美国垄断资本只在1949年就掠夺了总额达三亿八千一百万比索的利润，等于菲律宾同年出口货物总值的73％。
    事情愈来愈明显，贝尔贸易协定的束缚和片面地依附美国的结果，菲律宾的经济遭到了巨大的损害。随着整个资本主义世界中争夺市场斗争的尖锐化和美国经济危机因素的发展，菲律宾的经济情况更加恶化。在这种情况下，越来越多的人要求菲律宾摆脱美国的束缚，执行真正独立的对外政策。许多国会议员认为必须同民主阵营国家和亚非其他国家广泛发展贸易，这样不仅会扩大菲律宾的国外市场，而且会“打开从经济上挽救这个国家的道路”。今年三月十日，菲律宾众议院外交委员会通过了一个决议，要求重新审查菲律宾的外交政策，使菲律宾较少地依赖美国。决议指出：“菲律宾是一个东方国家”，并说：“如果菲律宾减少了对西方的依赖，并且建立和发展了它同邻国的关系，那末这将是符合菲律宾的最高利益的。”
    现在，菲律宾要求改变美、菲关系的运动，正在愈来愈扩大。“马尼拉纪事报”表示：“只有美国停止把菲律宾当作殖民地看待，目前对美国在菲律宾的行动的批评才会停止。”菲律宾许多报纸指出，如果美国仍然认为这不过是“区区烟草和糖的贸易问题”的“余波”，那就大错而特错了。
