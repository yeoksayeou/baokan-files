Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 7th. Over sixteen million mu of wheat in the Qin Chuan area of Shaanxi Province are currently growing taller than a person's chest, with full ears. The eight hundred li Qin Chuan is a golden expanse.

Xie Huaide, Director of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture, told our reporter: 1954 was the year of the greatest wheat harvest in Shaanxi Province's history, but this year's wheat is growing even better than that year. Looking at the current wheat growth, this year the average yield per mu of wheat in the province can reach more than two hundred jin, and in the Qin Chuan area, the average can reach three hundred jin.

Xie Huaide said: Unless there are major natural disasters in the near future, the unit area yield of wheat in the province can greatly exceed the original plan of more than one hundred and eighty jin per mu.

Shaanxi Province is one of China's major wheat-producing areas. Last winter, a total of more than twenty-four million three hundred thousand mu of wheat were sown in the province.

During the wheat sowing and growth period, the organized farmers throughout the province paid special attention to improving wheat cultivation techniques and management methods. Last winter, when wheat was sown, farmers in more than forty counties including Xingping, Wugong, and Weinan all sowed improved varieties of wheat. Agricultural cooperatives in various places also postponed the sowing date by about ten days according to the characteristics of the "Bima No. 1" improved variety, which is suitable for late sowing, to prevent excessive winter growth. The amount of sowing was also increased from ten jin to fourteen jin, and in some cases to eighteen or nineteen jin. In the past, wheat was generally not harrowed, but this year many agricultural cooperatives carried out harrowing. The area of wheat fields topdressed with fertilizer in various parts of the province reached more than 80%, and the average amount of fertilizer applied to each mu was generally six thousand to nine thousand jin.

Currently, agricultural cooperatives in various places are spreading ash fertilizer in the wheat fields and adopting various methods to prevent wheat lodging, in order to ensure increased production.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th. This year, national tea production will increase compared to last year. At present, Zhejiang's "Longjing," Jiangsu's "Biluochun," Jiangxi's "Zhulu," Anhui's "Qihong," "Tunlv," Fujian's "Minhong," Yunnan's "Dianhong," and Hubei's "Yihong," all of which are famous throughout the country, have already begun to be picked and are generally on the market. According to statistics from the purchasing departments, the amount of Anhui's Qimen black tea purchased by the end of April increased by two and a half times compared to the same period last year, and the amount of Yunnan's "Dianhong" purchased also exceeded 70% of the same period last year. According to reports from Anhui, Yunnan, Hunan, Guangdong and other provinces to the Ministry of Agriculture, it is estimated that tea production this year may increase by about 20% compared to last year.

　　陕西小麦丰收在望
    全国茶叶估计可增产20％
    新华社西安7日电  陕西省秦川地区的一千六百多万亩小麦目前长得高没人胸、穗子丰满，八百里秦川已一片金黄。
    陕西省农业厅厅长谢怀德告诉本社记者说：1954年是陕西省历史上最大的小麦丰收年，但今年的小麦比那年长得还好。看现在的小麦生长情况，今年全省小麦每亩平均产量可以达到二百斤以上，秦川地区平均可以达到三百斤。
    谢怀德说：最近如无重大自然灾害发生，全省小麦单位面积产量可以大大超过原订的亩产一百八十多斤的计划。
    陕西省是我国主要产麦区之一。全省去冬共播种小麦二千四百三十多万亩。
    在小麦播种和生长期间，全省组织起来的农民特别注意改进了小麦栽培技术和管理方法。去冬小麦下种时，兴平、武功、渭南等四十多个县的农民全部播种了小麦良种。各地农业社还根据“碧蚂一号”良种宜迟种的特性，将播种期推迟了十天左右，防止了冬旺。播种量也由十斤加大到十四斤，部分加大到十八、九斤。过去一般都不进行耙麦，今年有许多农业社进行了耙麦。全省各地农业社给麦田施追肥的面积达到80％以上，一般平均每亩都上到了六千斤到九千斤肥料。
    目前各地农业社正在给麦田中撒施灰粪，并采用各种方法防止小麦倒伏，以保证增产。
    据新华社6日讯  今年全国茶叶将比去年增产。现在，誉驰全国的浙江的“龙井”、江苏的“碧螺春”、江西的“逐绿”、安徽的“祁红”、“屯绿”、福建的“闽红”、云南的“滇红”以及湖北的“宜红”，都已经开始采摘；并且普遍上市。据采购部门统计，安徽的祁门红茶，到四月底的收购量就比去年同期增加了两倍半，云南“滇红”的收购量也超过了去年同期的70％。根据安徽、云南、湖南、广东等省向农业部的报告，估计今年茶叶可比去年增产20％左右。
