Xinhua News Agency, Amman, May 22nd: Sa'id al-Mufti, who was entrusted with forming the new cabinet, said on May 21st that Jordan would pursue a neutral policy. It will adopt a friendly and independent attitude within the Arab world.

The former prime minister, who refused British pressure for Jordan to join the Baghdad Pact when he was in charge of forming a cabinet last December, told Reuters that he expected his new cabinet to discuss the treaty between Britain and Jordan after its establishment. He pointed out that there was dissatisfaction with the treaty in Jordan, and when he was prime minister last year, he also suggested revising the treaty. He expressed his hope to maintain friendly relations and full understanding with Britain.

Mufti was ordered by King Hussein to form a cabinet after the resignation of former Prime Minister Rifai. In his letter of appointment to Mufti, the King of Jordan said that he hoped the new government would seek to establish a sound economy and take swift and prudent steps to deal with aggression and defend every inch of Jordanian territory.

The King of Jordan said that relations with Arab sister countries should be strengthened as much as possible and should be based on their common interests and hopes, and on their cooperation in assuming responsibilities. This requires us (Jordan) to continuously and practically participate in fulfilling our responsibilities to our Arab League countries, which are fighting for independence.

    约旦新首相表示约旦奉行中立政策
    新华社22日讯　安曼消息：受命组织新内阁的赛义德·穆弗蒂五月二十一日说，约旦将奉行中立政策。它将在阿拉伯世界之内采取友好和独立的态度。
    这位曾经在去年十二月任首相时拒绝了英国迫使约旦参加巴格达条约的组阁人对路透社记者说，他预期他的新内阁成立以后将讨论英国和约旦之间的条约的问题。他指出，约旦国内对这个条约感到不满，当他在去年担任首相的时候，他也曾经建议修改这个条约。他表示希望同英国保持友好的关系和充分的谅解。
    穆弗蒂是在前首相里法伊辞职后受国王侯赛尼的命令组阁的。约旦国王在给穆弗蒂的任命信上说，他希望新政府将设法建立健全的经济和采取迅速而慎重的步骤来对付侵略和保卫约旦的每一寸国土。
    约旦国王说，同阿拉伯姊妹国家的关系应该尽可能地强固，并且应该以它们的共同利益和希望为基础，以它们在承担责任方面的合作为基础。这需要我们（约旦）不断地和实际地参加履行我们对我们的阿拉伯联盟国家的责任，这些国家正在为争取独立而斗争。
