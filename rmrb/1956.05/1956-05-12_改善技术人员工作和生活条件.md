Improving the Working and Living Conditions of Technical Personnel

    In Chongqing, many engineering and technical personnel now have more and better time and environment for engaging in business and scientific research than before. Since March and April, many factories and mining enterprises have streamlined meetings that do not require the participation of engineering and technical personnel, and have equipped engineers with deputies or assistants, allowing them more time to engage in business and technical research. The Chongqing Railway Administration recently established a technical museum for technical personnel, which houses scientific and technological books on electrical, civil, and mechanical engineering, and is equipped with full-time management personnel. Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, Chongqing Cement Plant, and other units have added technical data and book equipment for engineering and technical personnel, and have tried their best to facilitate borrowing. They have also specially hired Russian teachers to organize technical personnel to learn Russian.

    The living conditions of engineering and technical personnel in Chongqing have also improved significantly. Chongqing Machine Tool Plant has begun to build a batch of economical and suitable spacious houses for engineers, which will be completed before the beginning of July. Chongqing Iron and Steel Company recently adjusted the salary and benefits of technical personnel, and the company also issued subsidies this year to engineering and technical personnel with particularly large families.

    改善技术人员工作和生活条件
    重庆市许多工程技术人员从事业务和研究科学技术的时间和环境，比以前更多更好了。三、四月份以来，不少厂矿企业为工程技术人员精简了不需要他们参加的会议，给工程师们配备了副职或助手，使他们有更多的时间从事业务和技术研究工作。重庆铁路管理局最近为技术人员设立了技术馆，馆内设有电务、工务、机务等科学技术书籍，配备了专职管理人员。重庆钢铁公司、重庆水泥厂等单位，都为工程技术人员们增添了技术资料和图书设备，尽量予以借阅方便。他们还专门聘请了俄文教师，组织技术人员学习俄文。
    重庆市工程技术人员的生活条件也有许多改善。重庆机床厂已经开始为工程师们新建一批经济、适用的宽敞住宅，七月初以前就可以全部建成。重庆钢铁公司最近调整了技术人员的工资待遇，对家庭人口特别多的工程技术人员，今年公司还发给了补助金。　（据新华社讯）
