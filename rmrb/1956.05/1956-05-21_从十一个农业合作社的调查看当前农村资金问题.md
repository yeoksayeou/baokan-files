An Investigation of Current Rural Funding Issues Based on a Survey of Eleven Agricultural Cooperatives
Liu Zhuguo

Recently, I accompanied a survey team from the Hunan Provincial Branch of the Agricultural Bank of China to eleven agricultural cooperatives (six advanced and five elementary) in six counties including Shuangfeng, Ningxiang, Yiyang, Xiangtan, and Changsha, focusing on the issue of funding. Based on the survey materials from these cooperatives, we believe the following issues are worth noting.

I. Insufficient Production Funds

Taking the eleven cooperatives we surveyed as an example, although each received support from national loans, nine of the eleven cooperatives currently have varying degrees of insufficient production funds. After our review and calculation, the pre-autumn funding gap for these nine cooperatives is 43,185 yuan.

The reasons for this situation are multifaceted. The most fundamental reason is that after farmers organized, their enthusiasm for production increased, and their demands for increased production rose, leading to a significant increase in production investment. In terms of agricultural investment, elementary cooperatives generally increased by 30-50% compared to last year, while advanced cooperatives generally increased by 50-70%. Obviously, such investment growth would have been impossible before farmers organized. Moreover, this year many agricultural cooperatives, especially the advanced ones, have also invested significant funds in capital construction and sideline operations. According to the statistics of the eleven cooperatives, this year's capital construction expenditure, averaged per mu of land, amounts to 0.82 yuan; this year's sideline investment, from the statistics of six out of the eleven cooperatives, averaged per person, amounts to 3.07 yuan. This was also rare in previous years.

Although the phenomenon of insufficient production funds is relatively common, it is not the case for all cooperatives. Among the eleven cooperatives we surveyed, two had relatively abundant production funds. Analyzing the reasons for the abundance of funds in these two cooperatives, the main reason is higher income from sideline occupations before autumn. For example, the Xiangtan Qimei Agricultural Cooperative, which has the most abundant funds, can reach more than 90,000 yuan in sideline income before autumn, accounting for more than 50% of the total source of funds before autumn for the entire cooperative. The side occupations they engaged in are burning lime, making bricks and tiles, digging and transporting white clay mud and silica sand, etc. These side occupations have low costs and quick returns, and thus can effectively solve the funding problems within the cooperative.

II. Difficulties in Members' Livelihoods

This is a very prominent problem we felt in the survey. According to the investigation of three cooperatives, among the 395 member households in the three cooperatives, a total of ninety-two households had difficulties in their livelihoods before autumn, accounting for about 23% of the total number of households.

Most of these households in difficulty are poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants. Among them, in addition to the difficulties of a few widowed, orphaned, and disabled households and households lacking labor, which are relatively long-term difficulties, the living difficulties of other households are temporary difficulties generated after basic cooperation. For example, before joining the cooperative, farmers arranged and used production and living funds according to their personal needs in order of priority; after joining the cooperative, production and living were completely separated, and production funds were uniformly controlled by the cooperative and could not be used to adjust personal living needs. For another example, after farmers joined the cooperative last winter, they were busy with collective labor such as water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation within the cooperative, and therefore engaged in fewer sideline occupations that had been used to supplement living expenses in previous years.

III. Internal Funding Potential Not Utilized

While the above situation shows that farmers have many difficulties in production and life, this is only one aspect of the problem. On the other hand, according to our investigation, the potential of farmers' own funds is still very large. According to the investigation of nine cooperatives, the investment that can be mobilized at present is at least more than 9,000 yuan. If these possible investments are taken into account, four cooperatives can basically overcome the difficulty of insufficient funds. In addition, according to the investigation of three cooperatives, about 10% of wealthy households have cash power of about 30 to 50 yuan per household, which can be invested in the cooperative for production or to adjust the lives of impoverished members. However, these funds have generally not been utilized. According to the statistics of the eleven cooperatives, the cash invested by members currently accounts for only 2.7% of the total sources of funds of the eleven cooperatives, of which there are even four cooperatives less than 1%. Not only have the existing surplus funds of members not been mobilized, but the share funds that should be paid have generally not been fully collected. According to the statistics of six cooperatives, this year's production fee shares generally only collect about 70%, and among the shares that have been collected, materials account for 79%, poor peasant cooperative fund loans account for 20.1%, and cash paid by members themselves accounts for only 0.9%.

Why has the internal funding potential not been fully utilized? On the one hand, many cooperative workers do not have a sufficient understanding of the spirit of "running the cooperative by relying on the masses." Some are passive because they "are afraid of trouble," "are afraid that the middle peasants will have opinions," or have not paid their shares or made investments themselves, and only hope to "solve the problem with loans." On the other hand, some members have not deeply understood the principle of "the community and the family being one," especially wealthy households, who are even more prominent in this regard and have more concerns (such as being afraid of revealing wealth, being afraid of investing too much, and being afraid of not getting pre-distributed, etc.). In addition to the above two situations, some cooperatives also have problems with the methods of mobilizing investment. For example, issues such as how members' investments will be returned and whether there will be interest are generally not clearly defined. A few cooperatives also adopt hard squeezing and deduction methods when mobilizing members to invest, which further increases members' concerns about investment.

IV. No Plan for Financial Revenue and Expenditure

Among the eleven cooperatives we surveyed, except for four advanced cooperatives that have a simple financial plan, the remaining five elementary cooperatives and two advanced cooperatives have not formulated a financial plan. Therefore, the staff and members of the cooperative have no idea about the overall financial situation to ensure the smooth realization of the cooperative's production plan. The staff of the cooperative only blindly feel that there is a shortage of funds and ask the state to provide more loans and more means of production, but they do not know exactly why, how much is needed, and when it is needed. In addition, due to the lack of a financial revenue and expenditure plan, there are inevitably unreasonable situations in the use of existing funds, which further aggravates the tension of funds in the cooperative and also violates the spirit of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily.

    从十一个农业合作社的调查看当前农村资金问题
    刘柱国
    最近，我曾随中国农业银行湖南省分行的调查组到双峰、宁乡、益阳、湘潭、长沙等六县的十一个农业合作社（高级社六个，初级社五个），做了关于资金问题的重点调查。从这些社的调查材料来看，我们到有以下几个问题值得注意。
    一、生产资金不足
    拿我们调查过的十一个社来看，虽然每个社都得到了国家贷款的支持，但是十一个社中就有九个社目前有不同程度的生产资金不足现象。经过我们审查核算的结果，九个社秋前资金收支差额是43，185元。
    产生这种情况的原因是多方面的。其中最基本的原因是农民组织起来以后，生产积极性高涨，增产要求提高，因而生产投资大大增加。在农业投资方面，初级社一般要比去年增加30—50％，高级社一般要增加50—70％。显然，这种投资增长的情况，在农民没有组织起来以前是不可能的。而且今年许多农业合作社，特别是其中的高级社还在基本建设和副业经营上，也投入了不少的资金。按十一个社统计，今年基本建设支出，如按田亩平均，每亩要摊0.82元；今年副业投资，从十一个社中的六个社统计，如按人平均，每人要摊3.07元。这在往年也是少有的情况。
    生产资金不足的现象，虽然比较普遍，但是也不是所有的社都是这样的。在我们所调查的十一个社中，有两个社生产资金比较宽裕。分析这两个社资金宽裕的原因，主要是秋前副业收入多。例如资金最为宽裕的湘潭棋梅农业合作社，秋前副业收入可达九万多元，占全社秋前资金来源总数的50％以上。他们经营的副业是烧石灰，做砖瓦，挖运白膏泥和矽砂等等，这些副业成本小，收入快，因而能够有效地解决社内的资金问题。
    二、社员生活有困难
    这是我们在调查中感到很突出的一个问题。根据三个社的摸底，在三个社共395户社员中，秋前生活有困难的共有九十二户，约占总户数23％。
    这些困难户，大多是贫农和新、老下中农。他们当中，除了少数鳏寡孤独户和缺劳动力的户的困难，是属于比较长期的困难外，其他户的生活困难，则是基本合作化后所产生的暂时困难。如农民在入社以前，对生产生活资金，是根据个人需要的先后缓急，自行安排运用的；入社后，生产、生活截然分开，生产资金由社统一掌握，不能用以调剂个人生活需要。又如去冬农民入社后，都忙于社内水利、积肥等集体劳动，对历年借以弥补生活开支的某些副业就比过去经营得少。
    三、社内资金潜力没有发挥
    以上情况，虽然说明农民生产和生活上困难很多，但是这只是问题的一方面，在另一方面，据我们调查，农民自有的资金潜力，还是很大的。根据九个社的摸底，目前可以发动的投资，至少在九千元以上。如果把这些可能发动的投资估计进去，就有四个社可以基本上克服资金不足的困难。另外据三个社的摸底，约有10％的富裕户，每户约有三、五十元的现金力量，可以投入社内用于生产或调剂贫困社员的生活。可是，这些资金一般还没有运用起来。按十一个社的统计，社员投资的现金，目前只占十一个社资金来源总数的2.7％，其中还有四个社不到1％。不仅社员现有多余资金没有发动起来，就是应缴的股份基金，一般还没有完全收齐。据六个社的统计，今年应收的生产费股金，一般只收齐70％左右，而已经收的股金中，实物占79％，贫农合作基金贷款占20.1％，社员自己交纳的现金只占0.9％。
    为什么社内资金潜力没有充分发挥呢？一方面是不少社的工作人员对“依靠群众办社”这一精神认识不足，有的因为“怕麻烦”，“怕中农有意见”，或自己没有交清股金或者没有投资而表现消极，只希望“贷款了事”。另一方面，有些社员对“社家一致”的道理还没有深切体会，尤其是富裕户在这一点上表现得更突出，顾虑也多（如怕露富，怕多投资，怕预分不到等）。除了以上两方面的情况外，有的社在发动投资的方式方法上，也有问题。例如：社员投资如何归还？有没有利息等问题，一般都没有明确的规定。也有少数社在动员社员投资的时候采取硬挤、硬扣的方式，更增加了社员投资的顾虑。
    四、财务收支无计划
    在我们调查的十一个社中，除四个高级社有一个简单的财务计划外，其余五个初级社和两个高级社，都没有制定财务计划。因此，社的工作人员、社员对保证社内生产计划顺利实现的全盘财务情况，心中无数。社的工作人员只是盲目地感到资金不足，要求国家多贷款，多供应生产资料，但是究竟为什么要，要多少，什么时候要，都不摸底。此外，由于财务收支无计划，在现有资金的使用上也不免有不合理的情况，这就更助长了社内资金的紧张，也违背了勤俭办社的精神。　（转载湖南日报）
