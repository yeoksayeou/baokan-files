Farmers' Art and Literary Creation Exhibition

    The laboring people's art and literary creation exhibition held in the Chongning County Cultural Center of Sichuan Province from the 1st to the 5th, featured more than twenty art works created by farmers, which were widely welcomed. These creations included operas, mountain songs, flower drum pieces, storytelling, and clapper talks, mainly reflecting the current agricultural cooperation movement, agricultural production, and the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionaries. Many were adapted from real people and events in the local area and possessed a strong flavor of life.

    Li Minghui, a member of the Vanguard Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wanshou Township, with only a junior primary school education, has created five quick clapper talks and flower drum lyrics in his spare time over the past few months. The script "Thousand-Jin Plan," collectively created by members of the United Agricultural Production Cooperative in this township with the theme of overcoming conservative thinking, and "Raise Vigilance," collectively created by the Five-Star Agricultural Cooperative in Qingxing Township, reflecting the anti-rebellion struggle, will be performed by many agricultural production cooperative clubs locally.

    农民的文艺创作展览会
    在四川省崇宁县文化馆一日到五日举办的劳动人民文艺创作展览会上，有二十多件农民创作的文艺作品受到普遍欢迎。这些创作中有戏剧、山歌、花鼓、说唱和金钱板等，主要是反映当前农业合作化运动、农业生产以及肃清反革命分子的斗争。有很多是依据本地真人真事编写成的，具有浓厚的生活气息。
    这个县万寿乡先锋农业生产合作社社员李明辉只有初小文化程度，他在最近几个月内利用休息时间创作了五个快板和花鼓词。这个乡联合农业生产合作社社员集体创作的以克服保守思想为主题的剧本“千斤计划”和庆兴乡五星农业社集体创作的反映肃反斗争的“提高警惕”，很多农业生产合作社俱乐部准备在当地演出。
