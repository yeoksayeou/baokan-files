Xinhua News Agency, May 4th: According to a TASS report from Paris on the 3rd, Parisian newspapers, in reporting on the upcoming North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting in Paris, raised the question of the fate of this military group, which has arisen due to the further easing of international tensions.

The right-wing "Le Figaro" said: "Due to the profound changes that have taken place in the overall international situation, this organization should change its methods, and in some respects even its goals..."

"Combat" stated, when discussing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting, that Dulles can no longer "turn a deaf ear to the new opinions put forward by Western European countries." The newspaper also believes that if the West "continues to adopt formulas that no longer work, Western policy will be in danger of failure."

"Libération" also talked about the contradictions between the member states of the North Atlantic Group. The newspaper said: Greece, Turkey, and Britain have quarreled over Cyprus, and the entire flank of the organization in the Balkans and the Near East has virtually collapsed. Scandinavian countries are restoring good-neighborly relations with the East and are tending towards prudent neutrality. Even in West Germany, more and more people oppose Adenauer's views and doubt whether it is necessary to establish a West German army. Iceland was the first to demand the withdrawal of American troops. France withdrew its elite troops from West Germany and sent them to North Africa. Bonn refused to continue paying the costs of maintaining the occupying forces, raising questions about whether British divisions should be permanently stationed on the continent. The newspaper emphasized that this situation proves that no one believes in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization anymore.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, May 3rd (TASS): American newspapers, commenting on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting opening in Paris on May 4th, said that the United States is not prepared to put forward any concrete proposals on the issue of expanding economic cooperation within the organization as requested by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states.

"Newsweek" said that Dulles' expression of willingness to discuss changing the nature of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is merely a trick aimed at reassuring America's allies and preventing the collapse of the North Atlantic Alliance's military structure.

　　巴黎报纸一致认为北大西洋集团的命运成问题
　　美国报刊指出美国并不关心这个军事集团的经济合作
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社巴黎三日讯：巴黎报纸在报道将在巴黎开幕的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议消息的时候，提出了由于国际紧张局势的进一步缓和而产生的这个军事集团的命运问题。
    右翼的“费加罗报”说：“由于总的国际局势已经发生了深刻的变化，这个组织应当改变自己的方法，在某些方面甚至应当改变自己的目标……”
    “战斗报”在谈到北大西洋公约组织理事会会议的时候表示，杜勒斯不能够再对“西欧国家提出的新意见充耳不闻了”。这家报纸还认为，如果西方“继续采用已行不通的公式，西方政策就会有失效的危险”。
    “解放报”也谈到北大西洋集团的成员国之间的矛盾。这家报纸说：希腊、土耳其和英国为塞浦路斯而发生了争吵，这个组织在巴尔干和近东的整个侧翼实际上是垮台了。斯堪的纳维亚国家在同东方恢复睦邻关系，并且趋向于明智的中立。甚至在西德，也有越来越多的人反对阿登纳的意见，怀疑建立西德军队是否必要。冰岛首先要求撤退美国军队。法国把自己的精锐部队从西德撤出，派往北非。波恩拒绝继续支付维持占领军的费用，而使得对英国师是否要常期驻在大陆这一问题产生了疑问。这家报纸强调指出，这种情况证明：谁也不再相信北大西洋公约组织了。
    新华社据塔斯社纽约3日讯　美国报刊在评论五月四日在巴黎开幕的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议的时候说，美国不准备就北大西洋公约组织会员国所要求的在这个组织的范围内扩大经济合作的问题提出任何具体的建议。
    “新闻周刊”说，杜勒斯表示愿意讨论改变北大西洋公约组织的性质的问题，这只是一种诡计，目的是想安慰美国的盟国和防止北大西洋联盟军事机构的瓦解。
