    Improve Product Quality
    Defective Boats Almost Cost Lives
    To the Editor:
    In the fourth quarter of last year, our cooperative ordered five small fishing boats and one large rowboat from the Wenzhou Shipyard. The quality of these boats was very poor. Our cooperative criticized them, and the Wenzhou Shipyard promised to improve product quality. However, in the first quarter of this year, the five small fishing boats and eight Lianjiang boats manufactured by the Wenzhou Shipyard for our cooperative were not only delivered late, but the quality was even worse. On April 23rd, these small fishing boats were in the sea for production when they encountered a Force 6 gale. As a result, the rudder stock of one boat broke, and the other three also had major problems. Fortunately, the boats in the same team towed these defective boats back to port, otherwise, it could have resulted in fatal accidents.
    The Wenzhou Shipyard should know that poor boat quality can kill people! They must take a responsible attitude towards the safety of fishermen's lives. Relevant higher-level leading units should inspect the work of this factory and urge it to conscientiously improve the quality of shipbuilding.

### 船只质量坏几乎出人命

    提高产品质量
    船只质量坏几乎出人命编辑同志：
    去年第四季度，我社向温州船厂订造五只小钓船和一只大排船。这些船只质量很坏，我社曾经提出批评，温州船厂也提出了改进产品质量的保证。但是，今年第一季度温州船厂为我社制造的五只小钓船和八只连江船，不但延期交货，而且质量更坏了。四月二十三日，这几只小钓船在海中进行生产，遇到了六级大风，结果有一只船的小舵杆折断，另外三只也出了很大毛病。幸好当时同队的船只把这些坏船拖到港里，否则就可能造成死亡事故。
    温州船厂应该知道，造船质量不好要害死人！他们必须对渔民的生命安全采取负责的态度。有关上级领导单位应该检查这个厂的工作，督促这个工厂认真提高造船质量。
