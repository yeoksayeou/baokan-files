Title: The Standards for Advanced Workers Must Not Be Lowered

Helping the less advanced to catch up with the advanced, and enabling the advanced to become even more advanced, so as to continuously improve our production level, is the purpose of carrying out the advanced producer movement. However, the Harbin Municipal Civil Engineering Company, in the process of selecting advanced producers, actually lowered the standards for advanced producers to the level of the average masses. For example, a worker in the First Engineering Team was careless and dropped his tool—a "qianzi" (crowbar or similar tool)—into the river during construction. This worker then retrieved it and was then evaluated as an advanced producer. One department even evaluated all its personnel as advanced producers, on the grounds that they were all enthusiastic in their work and could complete their assigned tasks.

Currently, many units have this phenomenon. In this way, it is impossible to distinguish between the advanced and the backward, and it is impossible to achieve the goal of the advanced driving the backward, and thus the significance of carrying out the advanced producer movement will be lost. This approach is obviously wrong.

    不能降低先进的条件
    先进帮助落后，使落后赶上先进，使先进更加先进，以便不断地提高我们的生产水平，这是开展先进生产者运动的目的。但是，哈尔滨市土木工程公司在评选先进生产者工作中，竟把先进生产者的条件降低到一般群众的水平。如第一工程队一名工人在施工中不注意，把施工的工具——千子掉进江中，这个工人又把它捞上来，就被评为先进生产者。有的科把本科人员都评为先进生产者，理由是工作都热情，都能完成分担的任务。
    目前还有不少单位有这种现象。这样，就分不出先进和落后，也就达不到先进带动落后的目的，因此也就会失去开展先进生产者运动的意义。这种作法显然是不对的。
