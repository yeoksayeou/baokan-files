　　Traditional Chinese Medicine "Internal Hemorrhoid Suppository Therapy"
    Tu Zhengfeng
    Lu Qi, a Western medicine doctor in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, studied traditional Chinese medicine and, combining his decades of clinical experience, researched and developed a simple and effective method for treating internal hemorrhoids: Internal Hemorrhoid Suppository Therapy. This therapy has been clinically tested at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Medical College for fifteen months, proving that it can be used for various types of middle and late-stage internal hemorrhoids, except for early-stage internal hemorrhoid patients with small hemorrhoids located too deep for easy insertion; patients with tumors, polyps, or inflammation in the rectum or anus; kidney patients; and pregnant women. It is considered one of the better therapies currently available for treating internal hemorrhoids. This therapy not only makes it easy to control the dosage according to the condition and eliminates the patient's pain during treatment, but also has a short treatment course and high efficacy. According to statistics from 115 cases at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Medical College, 109 people have been cured, and the remaining six have also improved, with a cure rate of 94.8%. Among them, 47% of the cases were cured after only one suppository insertion, and the maximum was five insertions, accounting for 0.9% of the total cases. The treatment time is generally between eleven and fifteen days, and the longest is thirty-five days to be cured. There has been no recurrence at the original site or adverse sequelae after the cure. Patients can continue to work as usual during treatment.
    In 1938, while working at Ouhai Hospital in Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, Dr. Lu Qi felt that Western medicine's surgical removal of hemorrhoids caused great pain to patients. Later, he obtained a traditional Chinese medicine prescription for treating hemorrhoids from his father-in-law, which he researched and used to treat patients with good results. However, the only drawback was that it still could not relieve the patient's pain during treatment, and the operation procedure was also very cumbersome. At this time, he thought of the Western surgical method of using phenol or alcohol aqueous solution mixed with glycerol to prepare an emulsion, and then injecting the emulsion into the center of the hemorrhoid with a syringe. He tried to mix the Chinese medicine powder with glycerol to form an emulsion and inject it into the hemorrhoid for treatment, but because the drug was absorbed too quickly, it could only treat early-stage patients, and the efficacy for middle and late-stage patients was not ideal. Then, he made further experiments, adding a binding agent to the Chinese medicine powder to make a spindle-shaped drug strip, which was inserted into the center of the hemorrhoid like an acupuncture needle. The experimental results were good, and after further research and improvement, it became the current suppository therapy.
    The entire medical process of internal hemorrhoid suppository therapy fully demonstrates the necessity of scientific cooperation between Chinese and Western medicine. Internal hemorrhoid suppository therapy involves inserting a drug strip made of seventeen kinds of traditional Chinese medicines with strong corrosive, astringent, and regenerative effects, with an appropriate amount of binding agent, into the center of the hemorrhoid. After the drug strip melts, it causes the hemorrhoid to gradually wither and eventually fall off. The wound surface is affected by another part of the drug, which stimulates tissue repair and regeneration, gradually healing. However, in order to further reduce the patient's pain, prevent accidental infection, and ensure accurate diagnosis, in addition to using surgical instruments for treating hemorrhoids in Western medicine, electric suction devices, anal suction horns, and round-headed scissors for cutting off excess drug strips exposed outside the hemorrhoid were designed and manufactured according to the needs of the suppository insertion operation. Furthermore, Chinese and Western medicines are mixed to prepare antispasmodic, analgesic, and disinfecting suppositories for use with suppository insertion. If patients are found to have combined symptoms such as anemia or indigestion during treatment, Western medicine is generally used for treatment.
    In order to make the treatment effect of internal hemorrhoid suppository therapy higher and enable more medical personnel to use this therapy, the Zhejiang Provincial Health Department organized a three-person suppository research team led by Dr. Lu Qi to continue to study how to reduce the patient's local and systemic reactions to the minimum limit and the effective ratio and preparation method of various Chinese medicine components in the drug strip. The Zhejiang Provincial Health Department also held a "Internal Hemorrhoid Suppository Therapy" training class in November 1955, and on April 16th of this year, the Health Department held an award ceremony, where the head of the Health Department, on behalf of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Committee, awarded Dr. Lu Qi a bonus of 3,000 yuan. Currently, this therapy has been widely promoted in hospitals in Hangzhou, Jinhua, Ningbo and other places.

　　中药“内痔插药疗法”
    屠正峰
    浙江杭州市西医陆琦学习了祖国医学，结合自己几十年的临床经验，研究整理出一种简便有效的治疗内痔的方法——内痔插药疗法。这种疗法经过浙江医学院附属第二医院十五个月的临床实验证明，除了初期内痔病人因痔核小、位深不便插药；直肠、肛门内有肿瘤或息肉或患有炎症的病人，肾脏病人以及孕妇要禁忌外，其它各种类型的中期、晚期内痔病都可以采用，是目前几种治疗内痔方法中比较好的一种疗法。这种疗法，不仅便于针对病情掌握用药剂量，免除病人在治疗过程中的痛苦，而且疗程短，疗效高。据浙江医学院附属第二医院115个病例统计，有109人已经痊愈，其余六人也有进步，治愈率达94.8％。其中插药一次即痊愈的占病例数的47％，最多的插药五次，占总病例数的0.9％；治疗时间一般在十一天到十五天，最多的经过三十五天也就痊愈了。愈后没有发生原位复发的现象和产生不良后遗症。病人在治疗期间仍可以照常工作。
    1938年，陆琦医师在浙江温州瓯海医院工作期间，就感觉到西医施手术割治痔核，给病人带来很大的痛苦。后来他从他的岳父那里得到了中医治疗痔核的处方，他就把这个处方拿来进行研究，并按照原方给病人进行治疗，治疗的效果很好。但是，唯一的缺陷是仍然不能解除病人在治疗期间的痛苦，而且操作手续也很繁琐。这时，他想起了西医外科用酚或醇的水剂同甘油混合配制的乳剂，再用注射器将乳剂注入痔核中心的操作方法很好，于是试着
  把中药的粉剂加入甘油调成乳剂注入痔核治疗，但是，因为药物吸收太快，只能治疗初期病人，对中期和晚期病人的疗效不够理想。接着，他又作了进一步试验，在中药粉剂中加入胶着剂，制成梭状药条，像刺针一样刺入痔核中心，试验结果，效果良好，再经过研究改良，就成为现在的插药疗法。
    内痔插药疗法的全部医疗过程，充分表现了中西医学科学合作的必要性。内痔插药疗法是将带有强烈腐蚀性、收敛性和新生作用的十七种中药加入适量的胶着剂制成的药条插入痔核中心，药条融化后，会使痔核逐渐枯萎，最后脱落；创面受另一部分药物的影响，激起组织的修补和新生作用，逐渐愈合。但是为了更多地减轻病人的痛苦，防止意外的感染和保证诊断精确，除了应用西医外科治疗痔核用的器械外，根据插药操作的需要设计增制了电吸引器、肛门吸角和用来剪除露在痔核外面多余药条用的圆头剪刀等，并且还用中西药混合配制了解痉镇痛和消毒的坐药，配合插药使用。在治疗期间如果发现病人有贫血、消化不良等合并症状，一般也采用西药治疗。
    为了使内痔插药法的治疗效果更高，使更多的医务人员能运用这一疗法，浙江省卫生厅组织了以陆琦医师为主的三人插药研究小组，继续研究如何使病人局部反应和全身反应降低到最低限度，药条中各种中药成分的有效比例和配制方法的问题。浙江省卫生厅在1955年11月还曾举办了一期“内痔插药法”训练班，并且在今年四月十六日，卫生厅举行了授奖大会，由卫生厅负责人代表浙江省人民委员会授给陆琦医师奖金三千元。目前这一疗法，已经在杭州、金华、宁波等地医院普遍推广。
