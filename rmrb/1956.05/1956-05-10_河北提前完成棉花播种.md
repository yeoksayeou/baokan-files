　　Hebei Completes Cotton Planting Ahead of Schedule
    Hebei Province completed cotton planting half a month ahead of schedule compared to previous years. As of May 1, the province had sown more than 17,293,500 mu of cotton.
    The person in charge of the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture told reporters that the most prominent features of cotton planting in Hebei this year are: more fertilizer, earlier planting, and better technology. In Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang and other major cotton-producing areas in the south, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of cotton field increased by two to three times compared to last year, and in a few cases even more than four times. Thanks to the adequate preparation of the agricultural producers' cooperatives and the good organization of labor, coupled with the launch of labor emulation drives, the planting work progressed rapidly, with most areas completing planting in just half a month. In order to strive for higher yields, the broad masses of cooperative members are very active in learning and improving planting techniques, and close planting technology has been widely promoted throughout the province. This year, more than 80% of the cotton fields in the Baoding area have been converted to north-south ridges to allow the cotton seedlings to ventilate and let light in, which is conducive to growth. Because of the improvement of planting technology, the cotton seedlings are emerging very well. According to inspections in Wu'an, Feixiang and other counties, full seedling emergence accounts for 92% of the total cotton fields.
    At present, the cotton seedlings in the southern region have grown three or four leaves, and the cooperative members have begun thinning and carrying out the first cotton field loosening. Cooperative members in the northern region are carrying out intensive seedling inspection and replanting work.

　　河北提前完成棉花播种
    河北省棉花播种比往年提前半月完成。截至五月一日统计，全省已播种棉花17，293，500多亩。
    河北省农业厅负责人告诉记者说，今年河北棉花播种最突出的特点是：施肥多，下种早，技术好。南部主要产棉区邯郸、邢台、石家庄等专区，每亩棉田施肥量比去年增加两三倍，少数甚至增加四倍多。由于农业生产合作社的准备工作充分，劳动力组织得好，同时又开展了劳动竞赛，播种工作进展很快，多数地区仅半月就完成了播种。为了争取更高的产量，广大社员对学习和改进播种技术非常积极，密植的技术已在全省普遍推广。保定专区今年还有80％以上的棉田改为南北垅，以便棉苗通风透光，利于生长。因为播种技术的提高，棉苗出的很好，据武安、肥乡等县检查，出全苗的占棉田总数的92％。
    目前，南部地区的棉苗已长出三、四个叶，社员们已经开始间苗和进行第一次棉田松土。北部地区的社员们，正在进行紧张的查苗、补苗工作。
