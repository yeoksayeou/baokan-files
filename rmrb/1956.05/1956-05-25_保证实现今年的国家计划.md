    Guarantee the Implementation of This Year's National Plan

    The 1956 National Economic Plan was formulated on the basis of the bumper harvest in agriculture in 1955 and the high tide of socialist transformation, in accordance with the spirit of the instructions from the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on opposing right-leaning conservatism, doing a better, faster, more efficient, and more economical job of socialist construction, and completing the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. This plan basically reflects the high tide of China's socialist revolution and the overall upsurge in the national economy. It is both proactive and reliable. Striving to guarantee the implementation of this plan will make it possible to complete some of the main indicators of China's First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

    In recent months, all departments and regions have universally launched socialist labor emulation campaigns, setting off a wave of completing the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and exceeding targets. A large number of advanced producers have emerged in many industrial enterprises, basic construction sites, and transportation units. Rationalization proposals have poured in, new records have been constantly set, and old quotas have been continuously broken. Some technical and economic norms have been raised again and again and have reached or even exceeded the targets set by the state for 1957. In particular, some production units and construction units, in the socialist labor emulation of the masses, not only emphasized "more" and "faster," but also emphasized "better" and "more economical." The product quality of some enterprises has been greatly improved compared to the past. For example, the quality of high-quality steel ingots produced by Daye Special Steel Plant failed to meet the quality targets month after month last year. In the first quarter of this year, it not only completed the production plan month after month, but also completed the quality targets continuously. Some departments have also made significant achievements in saving raw materials. For example, the First Ministry of Machine Building, as a result of inventory checks and adjustments, can transfer 10,400 tons of high-quality steel and 18,000 tons of ordinary steel. Except for medium and thick plates and certain types of high-quality steel, which are still insufficient, the problem of steel shortage in the second quarter has been basically resolved. All of these have created extremely favorable conditions for guaranteeing the completion and overfulfillment of the 1956 plan.

    However, with the acceleration of socialist transformation and the upsurge in production and construction throughout the country, new imbalances have also emerged: in terms of production, on the one hand, the production enthusiasm of the masses is unprecedentedly high, and there is a demand to increase output value and increase production, with planned targets being increased at each level; but on the other hand, the supply of raw materials is insufficient, technical forces and coordination conditions are not yet well adapted, the quality and specifications of products cannot meet the needs of society, and especially safety accidents are still very serious in some enterprises. In terms of basic construction, on the one hand, there is a demand for more investment and faster construction; but on the other hand, the supply of building materials and technical equipment is insufficient, and there is still a mismatch between design and construction forces. In order to achieve this year's national plan, these new imbalances must be overcome.

    How should we implement this year's national plan? This requires strengthening the inspection of plan implementation and guiding the socialist enthusiasm of the masses to summarizing and promoting advanced experiences, improving technology, exploring potential strengths, strengthening coordination and cooperation, overcoming weak links and imbalances, etc., so that the plan is based on comprehensive balance and proactive reliability. In the inspection of this year's plan implementation, in addition to strengthening the leadership of agricultural production, special attention should also be paid to guaranteeing the completion of the plans for industrial production, basic construction, commodity circulation, and training construction personnel, which is of great importance for completing the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

    In industrial production, in order to meet the needs of national construction and people's livelihood, strengthening product design, improving product quality, and increasing product variety are of particular importance. For production units whose product quality and variety specifications do not meet social needs, the enthusiasm of the masses should be guided to improving technology, strengthening the trial production and production of new products, improving and implementing process regulations, establishing quality standards, and strictly inspecting quality to meet the requirements of all parties. For the production of certain mechanical products, since the supply of raw materials is relatively tight this year, it is necessary to strive for a balance between supply, production, and sales based on the supply and sales situation, equipment capacity, technical strength, and coordination conditions, while diligently checking inventory materials, saving the use of raw materials, and improving product quality. For the production of certain raw materials needed for production and construction, such as pig iron, steel, and cement, the enthusiasm of the masses should be guided to diligently tap the potential of enterprises, actively increase production while ensuring variety specifications and delivery times. For those technologically backward enterprises, it is necessary to guide the workers and masses to actively study technology, learn and promote advanced experiences, carry out technological improvements, and learn from technologically advanced enterprises. For production and cooperation units, it is necessary to guide the workers and masses to restore and improve cooperative relationships, so that the cooperative relationships adapt to the needs of production and ensure that the cooperative products meet the requirements of the user units. In short, it is necessary to greatly improve the management and technical management level of enterprises by various means according to the different tasks and different situations of each enterprise.

    In basic construction, the amount of basic construction investment in 1956 is very large, and the scale of construction is very large, so more attention should be paid to the overall balance of material supply, design, and construction forces. If we only see the favorable conditions in construction, but do not pay attention to the insufficient supply of design drawings, machinery and equipment, especially building materials, it will put our construction at risk of partially failing. Therefore, construction projects with guaranteed material supply and technical strength should be started in a timely manner. Those projects for which there is no certainty of material supply and technical strength should be handled quickly. Do not rush to start projects that have not yet been started. In short, the construction projects, construction scale, and construction progress should be coordinated with the supply of materials, equipment, and the possible cooperation of technical forces. All construction departments should guide the masses to pay attention to implementing technical operating procedures, improving project quality, saving funds and materials, and quickly realizing investment results.

    In terms of transportation and commodity circulation, it is necessary to fully estimate the needs of grain, fuel, industrial products, and raw materials due to the upsurge in industrial and agricultural production and large-scale construction, and guide the enthusiasm of the masses to improving business management. In particular, attention should be paid to strengthening purchasing and sales work, making full use of various business capabilities, and meeting the needs of the people in a timely manner.

    In education, with the overall upsurge in the national economy, various effective measures should be taken to ensure the country's need for various construction talents.

    Some departments have already begun to inspect the implementation of the plan, paying attention to consolidating the socialist enthusiasm of the masses and implementing it in production and construction. However, there are still a few units that are still entangled in paperwork and routine work, and take an indifferent attitude towards the problems in the implementation of the plan. They do not realize that the formulation and issuance of the plan is only the beginning of the plan, and the important issue is how to organize the implementation of the plan and promote the realization of the plan.

    Strengthening the inspection of plan implementation must be combined with solving the main problems existing in the process of plan implementation. All departments and regions should conduct inspections in a planned, purposeful, and systematic manner, focusing on the problems existing in each period, and promptly study, summarize, and solve them. It is not right to only inspect without conclusions, or to only find problems without solving them. The inspection of plan implementation must also be combined with giving full play to the enthusiasm of the masses. Only by combining leadership and the masses can we deeply and comprehensively discover problems, find weak links, create favorable conditions, and draw correct conclusions to solve problems. And only by relying on and mobilizing the masses to carry out inspections, can our production and construction work be effectively improved after inspection and summarization.

    This second quarter, the tasks of industrial production, basic construction, material supply, and transportation and commodity circulation are very heavy. The success of the second quarter plan is of great significance for completing the 1956 plan. All departments and regions must seize this time, quickly transfer and organize a group of cadres, go deep into factories, mines, and construction sites to conduct on-site inspections, find favorable factors, overcome weak links, and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the 1956 National Economic Plan.

    保证实现今年的国家计划
    1956年度国民经济计划是在1955年农业的丰收和社会主义改造的高潮的基础上，根据党中央和毛主席关于反对右倾保守主义，把社会主义建设事业做得又多、又快、又好、又省和提前完成第一个五年计划的指示的精神编制的。这个计划基本上反映了我国社会主义革命高潮和国民经济全面高涨的形势，它是积极而又可靠的。努力保证这一计划的实现，将使我国第一个五年计划的某些主要指标有可能提前完成。
    最近几个月来，各部门、各地方普遍地开展了社会主义劳动竞赛运动，掀起了提前和超额完成第一个五年计划的热潮。许多工业企业和基本建设工地以及交通运输单位，涌现了大批的先进生产者，合理化建议纷至沓来，新纪录不断出现，旧的定额不断被突破。有些技术经济定额一再提高后，已经达到甚至超过了国家所规定的1957年的指标。特别是有一些生产单位和建设单位在群众的社会主义劳动竞赛中，不但重视了“多”和“快”，而且重视了“好”和“省”。有些企业的产品质量较过去大大提高，如大冶特殊钢厂的优质钢锭，去年月月完不成质量指标，今年第一季度内不但月月完成了产量计划，也连续完成了质量指标。有些部门对于节约原材料也有显著的成绩，如第一机械工业部进行仓库清查和调剂使用的结果，可以调剂出优质钢一万零四百吨，普通钢一万八千吨。该部除中厚板和某些品种的优质钢材还不够以外，第二季度钢材不足的问题已基本解决了。所有这些，对保证完成和超额完成1956年度的计划创造了极为有利的条件。
    但是，在全国社会主义改造的速度加快、生产和建设事业高涨的情况下，新的不平衡现象也出现了：在生产方面，一方面是群众的生产热情空前高涨，要求增加产值，提高产量，计划指标层层要求增加；但是另一方面，原材料供应不足，技术力量和协作条件还不相适应，产品的质量和规格还不能满足社会上的需要，特别安全事故在某些企业仍然是很严重的。在基本建设方面，一方面是要求多投资，快建设；但是另一方面，建筑材料和技术装备供应不足，设计和施工力量还存在着不相适应的状态。为了实现今年的国家计划，必须克服这些新的不平衡现象。
    应该怎样去实现今年的国家计划呢？这就必须加强计划执行情况的检查，并把群众的社会主义积极性引向总结和推广先进经验，提高技术，发掘潜在力量，加强协作配合，克服薄弱环节和不平衡现象等等方面去，使计划建立在全面平衡和积极可靠的基础上。在今年计划执行情况的检查中，除了应该加强对农业生产的领导以外，还应该特别注意保证工业生产、基本建设、商品流转和培养建设人材的计划的完成，这对于提前完成第一个五年计划具有重大的作用。
    在工业生产方面，为着满足国家建设和人民生活的需要，加强产品设计工作、提高产品质量和增加产品种类具有特别重要的意义。对于那些产品质量和品种规格不适合社会需要的生产单位，应该把群众的积极性引向提高技术，加强新产品的试制和生产工作，改进和贯彻工艺规程，建立质量标准和严格质量的检查，以满足各方面的要求。对于某些机械产品的生产，由于今年的原材料供应比较紧张，必须根据供销情况、设备能力、技术力量和协作条件，在努力清查库存材料和节约使用原材料以及提高产品质量的基础上，力求供产销的平衡。对于为生产和建设所需要的某些原材料如生铁、钢材和水泥等产品的生产，应该把群众的积极性引向努力挖掘企业的潜在力量，在保证品种规格和交货时间的条件下，积极增加生产。对于那些技术落后的企业，要引导职工群众积极钻研技术，学习和推广先进经验，进行技术改进，向技术先进的企业看齐。对于生产协作单位，要引导职工群众恢复和改进协作关系，使协作关系适应生产的需要，保证协作产品合乎使用单位的要求。总之，要根据各个企业不同的任务、不同的情况，用各种办法使企业的经营管理和技术管理水平大大提高一步。
    在基本建设方面，1956年基本建设投资数量很多，建设的规模很大，就更应该注意物资供应、设计和施工力量的全面平衡。如果只看到施工方面的有利条件，而没有注意到设计图纸、机器设备、特别是建筑材料的供应不足的情况，就会使我们的建设有部分落空的危险。因此，凡是物资供应和技术力量有保证的建设项目，应该及时开工建设。凡是物资供应和技术力量确无把握的，应该迅速加以处理。摊子没有铺开的不要急于铺开。总之，建设项目、建设规模和建设进度，应该和物资、材料、设备的供应情况及技术力量的可能配合起来。各个建设部门应该引导群众注意贯彻技术操作规程，提高工程质量，节约资金和材料，迅速发挥投资效果。
    在交通运输和商品流转方面，要充分估计到由于工农业生产的高涨和大规模建设对于粮食、燃料、工业品和原材料的需要情况，把群众的积极性引向改善经营管理方面去。特别要注意加强收购和推销工作，充分利用各种经营能力，及时地满足人民的需要。
    在教育事业方面，随着国民经济的全面高涨，应该采取各种有效措施，保证国家对于各种建设人材的需要。
    有些部门目前已经开始进行计划执行情况的检查工作，注意到把群众的社会主义积极性巩固下来，贯彻到生产和建设方面去。但还有少数单位仍然纠缠在公文来往和日常事务工作中，对于计划执行中的问题，采取不大关心的态度。他们没有认识到计划的编制和下达仅仅是计划的开始，重要的问题在于如何组织计划的执行，并促使计划的实现。
    加强计划执行情况的检查工作，必须同解决计划执行过程中存在的主要问题结合起来。各部门、各地方都应该针对每个时期存在的问题，有计划地、有目的地和系统地进行检查，及时研究、总结，并加以解决。那种只有检查而无结论，或者只发现问题而不解决问题的做法都是不对的。计划执行情况的检查工作，还必须同发挥群众的积极性结合起来。只有领导和群众相结合，才能深入地和全面地发现问题，找出薄弱环节，创造有利条件和得出解决问题的正确结论。而且也只有依靠和发动群众进行检查，我们的生产和建设工作在通过检查和总结之后，才能切实地提高一步。
    今年第二季度，工业生产、基本建设、物资供应以及交通运输和商品流转等方面的任务，都是很繁重的。第二季度计划完成的好坏，对于完成1956年计划具有重要意义。各部门、各地方都必须抓紧这个时间，迅速抽调和组织一批干部，深入工厂、矿山和施工现场进行实地检查，寻找有利因素，克服薄弱环节，保证完成和超额完成1956年度国民经济计划。
