　　How to Fulfill This Year's Burley Tobacco Production Increase Task
    In the first three years of China's first Five-Year Plan, the burley tobacco production plan was not fulfilled every year, which seriously affected the normal operation of the cigarette industry. The situation of burley tobacco planting in various places this year is also not good. According to typical surveys, in many key tobacco-producing areas in Guangxi and Henan, the early tobacco planting plan has not yet been completed.
    This year, the state stipulates that the burley tobacco planting area should be 32% more than last year, and the unit area yield of tobacco fields should be 11.9% higher than last year. Only by comprehensively completing this plan can we guarantee the needs of the country and the people. Now the early tobacco transplanting season is approaching, and late tobacco is about to begin planting. Rural staff in various tobacco-producing areas should accept past experiences and lessons, immediately seize the burley tobacco planting and transplanting work, and strive to make up for the losses in the previous stage and strive to complete this year's production tasks.
    The failure to complete the burley tobacco production plan is, to a large extent, the result of erroneous guidance from agricultural departments. In the past few years, the state has developed some new tobacco areas, which is naturally necessary. However, when dealing with the major issue of changing the farming system, the agricultural leading organs in some areas have adopted an intolerable lazy approach. They believe that developing new tobacco areas requires solving complex problems such as supplying seeds, fertilizers, and guiding cultivation techniques, and it is not easy to produce results in a short time. It is better to distribute the new tasks to the old tobacco areas. As a result, the tobacco planting tasks in some key tobacco-producing areas have exceeded 30% of the cultivated land area, and some have even reached 50% of the cultivated land area. With extremely heavy tasks and no crop rotation, the plan to expand the burley tobacco area can only become empty talk. This situation of improper task allocation still exists in some areas this year. All areas with burley tobacco production tasks must check the tasks that have been assigned before tobacco seedling transplanting: the province checks the tasks assigned to each county, and the county checks the tasks assigned to each township. Whenever the task is too heavy and cannot be completed, it should be appropriately reduced; and the reduced task should be assigned to appropriate areas. This work is quite complicated, but only by doing this work well can it be possible to truly complete the burley tobacco planting task.
    The burley tobacco production plan has not been completed because some farmers have doubts about the price policy. In the past few years, the tobacco price in individual areas was indeed too low, and there were phenomena of suppressing grades and prices in the procurement work. These have affected farmers' enthusiasm for planting burley tobacco. Since last year, those areas with excessively low tobacco prices have appropriately increased the purchase price. Compared with other crops, the tobacco price in various places is basically reasonable. However, because the adjustment of tobacco prices last year was relatively late, and farmers were not well informed, some farmers still doubt whether the tobacco price can be stabilized and whether the state will guarantee the purchase of more burley tobacco. Agricultural departments and purchasing departments in various places should use the opportunity before transplanting to explain the price policy and purchasing methods to farmers, stating that the tobacco price stipulated by the state is reasonable, and the state guarantees the due income of tobacco farmers; burley tobacco is a material that the state needs to fully control, and as long as it is produced, the state will definitely purchase it. Everyone should plant tobacco well in accordance with the state plan, which is beneficial to the country and to themselves. If these issues are clarified, farmers will plant burley tobacco according to the state plan.
    The burley tobacco production plan has not been completed because the production enthusiasm of farmers has been restricted and suppressed by some rural staff. The reason why these rural staff restrict farmers from planting tobacco is because they oppose the task of increasing grain production and planting burley tobacco, believing that if tobacco is planted, it will inevitably affect grain production; therefore, they put forward erroneous slogans to farmers such as "planting tobacco does not count as completing the task of increasing production" and "the government does not care if there is not enough grain," and as a result, they dampened the enthusiasm of farmers to plant burley tobacco. It is necessary to explain clearly to these cadres: it is the responsibility of every rural work cadre and every farmer to accurately and comprehensively complete the state's planting plan. Tobacco fields do not occupy much farmland, but they have great economic value; since the country and the people need burley tobacco, we should think of various ways to complete the production task. As long as the supply of grain and other materials is reasonably resolved for farmers, farmers will dispel various concerns. As long as we strive to improve farming techniques and implement a reasonable crop rotation system, it is entirely possible to complete the task of increasing grain production and increasing burley tobacco production at the same time.
    Another reason why the burley tobacco production plan has not been completed is the insufficient supply of cake fertilizer in tobacco producing areas. Cake fertilizer is indeed a good fertilizer for burley tobacco, and all localities should meet the supply of cake fertilizer for tobacco fields within the possible range. However, with the development of the country's economic construction, the uses of oil cake are increasing day by day. The supply of cake fertilizer will fall short of demand, which will be a long-term phenomenon. Therefore, farmers should be guided to learn how to apply other fertilizers in tobacco fields. In 1955, the Gongtong First Agricultural Cooperative in Changge County, Henan Province, planted 795,000 mu of late tobacco, with an average yield of 294.7 jin per mu. Among them, 25 mu were applied with 40 jin of cake fertilizer per mu, and the remaining tobacco fields were applied with 4,500 jin of native manure per mu, and top dressing (ammonium sulfate) 20 jin—30 jin, and the quality of tobacco leaves was two grades higher than in 1954. It can be seen that the saying "no cake fertilizer cannot guarantee quality" is wrong. This year, the state supplies a large number of chemical fertilizers to tobacco fields, with an average of 15 jin—20 jin per mu. As long as the cooperatives in tobacco producing areas are well promoted to accumulate and produce fertilizer, the commercial fertilizers that the state has determined to supply to tobacco areas are supplied to farmers in full, and farmers are guided to learn the technology of applying chemical fertilizers, the problem of insufficient fertilizer in tobacco fields can be completely solved.
    Producing burley tobacco requires higher technology. After completing the planting task, we must vigorously promote advanced farming techniques to increase the yield and quality of burley tobacco. According to surveys in various places, cultivating strong seedlings can increase production by more than 20%, and appropriately advancing the time of tobacco planting can increase production by 30 jin—50 jin per mu. All regions must strengthen technical guidance on seedling cultivation, help cooperatives to reasonably organize labor during the wheat harvest season, and achieve "harvesting wheat and planting tobacco at the same time." At present, in areas where the early tobacco planting area is insufficient and the spring land is small, we should strengthen the technical management of early tobacco seedlings, save the use of early tobacco seedlings, and strive to plant more early tobacco and barley stubble tobacco to complete the planting task as much as possible and increase the yield of burley tobacco.

### 怎样完成今年烤烟增产任务

　　怎样完成今年烤烟增产任务
    在我国第一个五年计划的前三年中，每年都没有完成烤烟生产计划，严重地影响了卷烟工业的正常开工。今年各地播种烤烟的情况也不好。据典型调查：广西、河南不少重点烟区，都还没有完成早烟播种计划。
    今年国家规定的烤烟种植面积，比去年多32％，烟田单位面积产量，比去年高11.9％。只有全面地完成这个计划，才能保证国家和人民的需要。现在早烟移栽季节就要到来，晚烟即将开始播种。各个产烟区的农村工作人员应该接受过去的经验教训，立即抓紧烤烟播种、移栽工作，努力弥补前一阶段的损失，争取完成今年的生产任务。
    烤烟生产计划没有完成，在很大程度上，是农业部门指导错误的结果。几年以来，国家发展了一些新烟区，这自然是必要的。但是，有些地区的农业领导机关，在处理这个关系改变耕作制度的重大问题的时候，却采取了不可容忍的懒办法。他们认为，发展新的烟区，要解决供应种籽、肥料和指导耕作技术等等复杂问题，一时不容易发生效果，倒不如把新任务分给老烟区。这样一来，有些重点产烟地区的种烟任务就超过了耕地面积30％，有的竟达到耕地面积的50％。任务奇重，轮作不开，扩大烤烟面积的计划只能成为一句空话。这种任务分配不当的情况，今年在一些地区还是存在着的。凡是有烤烟生产任务的地区，都要在烟苗移栽以前，把已经分配的任务加以检查：省检查分给各县的任务，县检查分给各乡的任务。凡是任务过重，确实不能完成的，要适当减轻；而把减下来的任务，分给适当的地区。这个工作相当复杂，但是，只有作好了这个工作，才有可能真正完成烤烟种植任务。
    烤烟生产计划没有完成，还因为某些农民对于价格政策有疑虑。过去几年中，个别地区的烟价确实偏低，收购工作中也有压级压价的现象。这都影响了农民种植烤烟的情绪。从去年开始，那些烟价过低的地区，已把收购价格适当地提高了。同别的农作物比较，各地的烟价基本上也是合理的。但是，由于去年调整烟价的时间比较晚，又没有对农民很好地进行宣传，所以有些农民还怀疑烟价是不是能够稳定，多种的烤烟国家是不是保证收购。各地的农业部门和收购部门应该利用移栽以前的时机，向农民讲解价格政策和收购办法，说明国家规定的烟价是合理的，国家保证种烟的农民应得的收益；烤烟是国家需要全部掌握的物资，只要生产出来，国家是一定收购的。大家应该按照国家计划好好种烟，这对国家、对自己都有好处。把这些问题解释清楚，农民就会按照国家计划种植烤烟。
    烤烟生产计划没有完成，也因为农民的生产积极性受了某些农村工作人员的限制和压抑。这些农村工作人员所以限制农民种烟，是因为他们把增产粮食和种植烤烟的任务对立起来，认为如果种了烤烟，必然影响粮食生产；于是对农民提出“栽烟不算完成增产任务”、“粮食不够政府不管”等错误口号，结果就把农民种植烤烟的积极性打下去了。要向这些干部说明白：准确地、全面地完成国家的种植计划，是每一个农村工作干部和每一个农民的责任。烟田占用农田不多，但经济价值很大；既然国家和人民都需要烤烟，就应该想各种办法完成生产任务。只要合理地为农民解决粮食和其他物资的供应问题，农民就会打消各种顾虑。只要努力改进耕作技术，实行合理的轮作制度，同时完成增产粮食和增产烤烟的任务，是完全可能作到的。
    烤烟生产计划没有完成的另一个原因，是烟产区饼肥供应不足。饼肥确实是烤烟的好肥料，各地应该在可能范围内，满足烟田的饼肥供应。但是，随着国家经济建设的发展，油饼的用途日益增多。饼肥供不应求，将是一个长期的现象。因此，应该指导农民学会在烟田施用别的肥料。1955年河南长葛县共同第一农业合作社栽晚烟79.5万亩，每亩平均生产294.7斤。其中的二十五亩每亩施用饼肥四十斤，其余烟田每亩施用土粪四千五百斤，追肥（硫酸铵）二十斤—三十斤，烟叶质量还比1954年提高两个等级。可见“没有饼肥不能保证质量”的说法是不对的。今年国家供应烟田大批化学肥料，每亩平均有十五斤—二十斤。只要很好地推动烟区的合作社积肥造肥，把国家已确定供应烟区的商品肥料照数供应到农民手中，并且指导农民学会施用化学肥料的技术，完全可以解决烟田肥料的不足的问题。
    生产烤烟需要较高的技术，在完成种植任务以后，还必须大力推广先进的耕作技术，提高烤烟的产量和质量。根据各地的调查，培育壮苗可以增产20％以上，适当提早栽烟的时间，每亩可以增产三十斤—五十斤。各个地区必须加强育苗的技术指导，帮助合作社在麦收时节合理组织劳力，做到“边收麦，边栽烟”。目前凡是早烟播种面积不足和春地较少的地区，应该加强早烟苗的技术管理，节约使用早烟苗，争取多栽早烟和大麦茬烟，尽量完成种植任务，提高烤烟的产量。
