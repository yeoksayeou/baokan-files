On May 11th, Yang Shihui, a renowned ivory carving expert from China, returned to Beijing from Chairman Mao's hometown with great enthusiasm. He went to Shaoshan Township, Xiangtan, Hunan Province, to experience life and create realistic designs in order to complete a significant piece of work in Chinese history – an ivory carving of the "Panorama of Mao Zedong's Former Residence." Yang Shihui stayed in Shaoshan for ten days. After repeated observations, interviews, and on-site sketches, he has now completed the first draft of the design for the "Panorama of Mao Zedong's Former Residence."

The "Panorama of Mao Zedong's Former Residence" is a picturesque spring plowing scene in Shaoshan. The entire Shaoshan is enveloped by mountains and forests. The mountains are covered with various trees and blooming azaleas. Shaofeng Peak stands tall in the distance beyond Chairman Mao's former residence. The scene includes the most beautiful Shaolu Bridge and Shaoshanzui. In the vast fields and on the paths, farmers are delivering manure, plowing the land, and digging up sod, reflecting the farmers' enthusiasm for labor after the high tide of agricultural cooperation. The scene also depicts farmers enjoying pleasant breaks from their labor. The clearest part of the scene is Chairman Mao's former residence, where the veteran revolutionary Mao Yueqiu is on the open ground next to the residence, telling international friends who have come to pay their respects and make friendly visits about Chairman Mao's leadership of the local people in revolutionary struggles. The scene also includes the tidy school buildings of Shaoshan Elementary School, and groups of children wearing red scarves and carrying flower baskets (for holding meals). Finally, at the end of the panorama, "Guangong Bridge" appears.

Since returning, Yang Shihui has been working on the finishing touches of the design. After soliciting opinions from arts and crafts experts, the design can be finalized. Yang Shihui said with confidence: "In about a month, I can start carving on a piece of ivory weighing more than one hundred pounds." He added: "Although I haven't started carving yet, I can predict that this ivory carving will be even better than the 'Panorama of Beihai'."

    雕刻毛主席故居全景
    五月十一日，我国著名象牙雕刻专家杨士惠兴致冲冲地从毛主席的故乡回到北京来了。他是为了完成我国历史上有意义的一件巨作——“毛主席故居全景”的象牙雕刻，而去湖南湘潭韶山乡体验生活，进行写实设计的。杨士惠在韶山住了十天。经过他的反复观察、访问和实地描绘，现在已经完成了“毛主席故居全景”设计图的初稿。
    “毛主席故居全景”是一幅景色秀丽的韶山春耕图。整个韶山被笼罩在群山和林木之中。山上有各种各样的树木和开满了的映山红（杜鹃花），在毛主席故居屋宇的远方，高高矗立着韶峰。画面上有风景最优美的韶麓桥和韶山嘴。在广阔的田野里和小道上，农民们正在送粪、耕地、铲草皮，反映了农业合作化高潮以后农民们的劳动热情。画面上也反映了农民们在劳动之余愉快地休息时的情景。最明朗的画面是毛主席的故居，和革命老人毛月秋在故居旁边的坪场上，向前来瞻仰和进行友好访问的国际友人讲述毛主席以前领导故乡人民进行革命斗争的情形。画面上还有整齐的韶山小学的校舍，和一群群带着红领巾，手提着花篮子（盛饭菜用）的孩子们。最后，在全景的尾部，出现了“关公桥”。
    杨士惠回来后，这几天正在完成这个设计图的整理加工工作，等征求工艺美术专家们的意见后，就可以定稿。杨士惠满怀信心地说：“再过一个月左右，就可以在一百多斤重的一根象牙上开始雕刻了。”他又说：“现在虽然还没有动手刻，但是我可以预料，这件象牙雕刻一定要比‘北海全景’还要好得多。”
