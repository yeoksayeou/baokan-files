What to Learn from the Performing Arts of "Fifteen Strings of Cash"
A Jia

The Kunqu Opera Troupe's performance of "Fifteen Strings of Cash," whether from the play's educational significance, writing art, directing treatment, or performance creation, is well worth studying for those engaged in opera and drama work. The characters are depicted concretely, and the performance is deeply experienced, which is the basic feature that distinguishes this play from general operas.

From a writing perspective, Yu Gzhi, as a character, belongs to the main contradictory aspect of the entire play's conflict, and he is a negative character. However, the author did not write him as a corrupt and lawless cruel official, but as an "honest official" who enforced the law like a mountain; he seemed to have followed the mass line and grasped solid evidence during the trial; outwardly observing expressions and inwardly deducing and speculating, he believed that all of this was logical. However, this kind of logic does not proceed from reality but from feelings and desires, so whether it is reasoning or judgment, the stronger the "logicality," the worse the solution to the matter becomes. This kind of person considers himself an honest official, is confident and justified, enforces the law severely, and does not feel guilty about wrongly killing people. This kind of "honest official" is actually more harmful than a corrupt one. This character has his typical significance and his realistic significance. On the other side of the main contradiction, Kuang Zhong, the author does not exaggerate to show the uprightness of this honest official, nor does he use bizarre methods to investigate the case and redress the injustice; in the two scenes of "Suspecting the Mouse" and "Visiting the Mouse," Kuang Zhong specifically raises questions and specifically solves problems. Here, it reminds me that in some opera and drama scripts, the author likes to use such techniques to solve specific problems, that is, when writing characters and conflicts, they often cleverly arrange this complex process and requirements for solving difficulties backstage, and then return to the front stage to have the characters in the play say something about the results of the matter, considering it an explanation of the problem. "Fifteen Strings of Cash" is not like this. It writes about Kuang Zhong, not to have him hide backstage to avoid difficulties, but to pull him to the front stage to face the contradictions and solve the problems on the spot. Please see the "Investigation" in "Suspecting the Mouse" and the "Character Divination" in "Visiting the Mouse," both of which expose the difficulties on the stage to see what attitude you take to solve them? Either a pragmatic attitude, or a self-righteous attitude. In the investigation, he found a coin, but he only regarded it as an important clue in the case, not as the final conclusion to solve the entire case. The final judgment and conclusion are traced from blood stains, one or two copper coins, gambling dice, embroidered purses, the answers of the masses, and even directly from the mouth of the murderer. This character is indeed lovable. He not only speaks out righteously and is unyielding, demonstrating the tenacity and noble qualities of adhering to the truth, but also demonstrates a serious, meticulous, and thorough work style. This character is opposite to Yu Gzhi, and has his typical significance and realistic significance.

Regarding the characteristics of the "Fifteen Strings of Cash" script, I will not make a comprehensive study here, only talk about this point. Here, let's talk about the issue of performing arts. The realistic creation of the script enriches the performing arts, and at the same time, the realistic creation in the performance reveals the content of the script more profoundly. The performances in "Sentencing to Beheading," "Meeting the Governor," "Suspecting the Mouse," and "Visiting the Mouse" are all wonderful, and each scene has its own characteristics. Here, I will only talk about the scene "Visiting the Mouse."

Lou Ashu is a vicious and very alert rogue. If the actor playing this role wants to choose a core in creating the character image, then "mouse" is the best core to express this kind of person. However, the clown role played by Wang Chuansong is not all about being mouse-like, simply imitating the physical movements of a mouse, but only borrows the agile and cunning characteristics of a mouse in experiencing the psychological activities of this rogue to help him complete the image creation of the character. Lou Ashu is not a person who truly fears the light and comes out at night, truly timid as a mouse. You see, after he killed You Hulu, he did not run away, but returned to You Hulu's house to observe, create public opinion among the masses, help the constables catch people, stand in court to testify, and praise Yu Gzhi's wise and decisive actions. He tried every means to promote the early resolution of this case so that he could be relaxed, happy, and at large. This is Lou Ashu's purpose. It was not until Kuang Zhong overturned the case and investigated that he changed his course according to the situation. He has been thinking of ways. On the one hand, he goes to the countryside for a few days to temporarily avoid the limelight, and on the other hand, he inquires about the situation and seeks other countermeasures. Lou Ashu is naturally very scared in his heart. One moment he shouts, "If you haven't done anything wrong, you won't be surprised when someone knocks on your door in the middle of the night," and the next moment he shouts, "Heart pounding, restless." The script does not write about this intense inner activity prominently enough, but Wang Chuansong seized these links and ran through the actions very clearly, and brought this character to life. Zhou Chuan Ying's portrayal of Kuang Zhong is a great success in performance. Kuang Zhong's situation is very tense, and within the time limit set by the governor's office, he must thoroughly solve the difficulties of overturning the case. "Visiting the Mouse" is the last link in solving the entire case. In Kuang Zhong's view, the closer the problem is to being solved, the more cautious he should be. When he meets the murderer Lou Ashu, his emotions are very complicated; on the surface, he is divining characters and making jokes, but in his heart, he is very angry and really wants to put this murderer in shackles immediately; but his task is to make a reliable conclusion on this case on Lou Ashu without far-fetched associations, so his attitude is also very serious and earnest. Zhou Chuan Ying organically combined his performing talents and skillful techniques with the character's ideological logic according to the situation Kuang Zhong was in to complete the performance task of "private visit," not generally starting from the concept of an honest official's private visit, so he brought this character to life.

Zhou Chuan Ying's performance of "Visiting the Mouse" makes people see that he has his directorial outline (he is also one of the directors of this play). This composition is manifested in Kuang Zhong's adoption of a method of catching and releasing when dealing with Lou Ashu. You see, Kuang Zhong always stabs Lou Ashu with a sharp word first, and when this murderer is very fearful and panicked, he uses comforting words to relieve his burden and give him a way out. Because Kuang Zhong knows that if things are made too tense, it will be difficult to discuss the problem further. This scene moves and teases in its composition like a cat catching a mouse, until the cunning Lou Ashu completely submits. In terms of the fighting sides in this scene, Kuang Zhong is active and Lou Ashu is passive. But Lou is not retreating, but actively thinking of ideas; but the more he believes in the accuracy of character divination, the more he feels that fate cannot be escaped. As soon as Kuang Zhong points out the crux of the matter, he always suppresses his fear, forces a smile, and reluctantly mocks Kuang Zhong. We can see that this cunning murderer, on the one hand, hopes that the character divination master will solve his difficulties, point out the way, and turn bad luck into good; on the other hand, he is afraid that others will see through his thoughts, that is, he requires the character divination to be accurate, but he is also afraid that it will be accurate. This kind of psychological conflict promotes the development of the play. Zhou Chuan Ying's play is also very interesting. He plays Kuang Zhong, and Kuang Zhong plays the character divination master again. From Kuang Zhong's performance, he must suppress his angry emotions in front of Ashu, and must always guard against revealing the demeanor of an official. From the attitude of the character divination master, he is afraid that he is pretending to be too false and exaggerated, so that the cunning murderer dares not trust him. Lou Ashu is a gambler, and he may not be without scruples about the traveling Jianghu masters. Only by truly performing the Jianghu loyalty, the so-called "all people within the four seas are brothers," can Kuang Zhong convince him, be willing to entrust his life to him, and regard him as a "life-saving Bodhisattva."

The above only illustrates that the reason why the two actors performed so wonderfully in this scene makes us understand that it is mainly due to their ability to correctly grasp the behavioral logic of the characters and deeply understand the psychological activities of the characters. This is certainly extremely important, but here we should also talk about the technical characteristics of this scene. It is a harmful statement to only have inner analysis without paying attention to performance techniques, or to think that with inner experience and abundant emotions, beautiful and persuasive external movements will naturally arise accordingly. This scene only has two people, there is no stage scheduling, the two people sit on a bench to perform, there is no singing, no passionate blowing of beards and glaring eyes, they are just talking, thinking, judging, and probing and observing. In this way, the play is explained clearly bit by bit, attracting us to the situation of the characters in the play, and feeling and breathing with them. Why is it so attractive? Here, we want to talk about the technical problems of Kunqu opera, which is also a problem of expressiveness. Of course, it is difficult to record the action spectrum of the two actors in detail and without omissions using a recording method, and there is no need to do so. We only raise some questions from the perspective of technical rules. This is not to ask us to proceed from technology when performing, but to hope that we pay attention to these issues and learn from these experiences.

First, the action is clear and the levels are distinct. When we talk about technology or artistic works, we often require a sense of proportion and clear colors and lines. These two actors have done this. Whether it is a hand gesture or a foot movement, they are very measured and accurate, with distinct levels. For example, when both hands are moving, although the process is complex, it is always clean and neat, not dazzling you. Unlike some opera actors, when they are moving, they do several actions at the same time, without undulation; or the action covers the action, without distance, without perspective, without unevenness; or the action only has a smooth side, lacking a sharp side; or the large outline is accurate, but the small movements are not precise. These two Kunqu opera actors are not like this. They can express the color of the rhythm in the most subtle movement lines. Chinese ink paintings pay attention to dividing ink into five colors, and their actions are the same. That is, they can divide the layers in the most monotonous tones. In this way, there is a way to express delicate emotions and subtle psychology.

Second, the action lines are continuous. Some actors, when singing or reciting, desperately perform body movements, gesturing this way and that way; once the singing or speaking is over, the action is also over. When they sing or speak again, they start to move again, like puppets. Zhou Chuan Ying and Wang Chuansong's performances are not like this. Their actions are tightly connected, without disconnection; it is not that one hand is raised and the other hand is isolated and motionless, it is not that the arm moves and the wrist does not move, and the wrist moves and the fingers do not move. For example, picking the beard, flying sleeves, lifting the robe, holding the belt, and even a blink of the eyes and a lift of the eyebrows are all connected and organically linked. Some large body stunts are also like this, such as when Kuang Zhong said, "That family is surnamed You," Lou Ashu, upon hearing this, immediately somersaulted and jumped out from under the bench, and then jumped onto the bench again to imitate a mouse stealing oil. Although these actions are divided into sections, they are done in one go, not separated. The connection and continuity of actions does not mean that they must be entangled together like dead vines缠老树, but that they are seemingly connected but actually separated. Sometimes the form is broken, but the momentum is not broken. Mastering these techniques, there is a way to overcome the problems of stiffness and rigidity in the external form.

Third, the action postures are selective and expressive. The opera stage pays attention to body movements, requiring the audience to see all sides and to look good from any angle. Opening, closing, entering and exiting the stage should all show the purpose of the role in the action and body movements. For example, when Lou Ashu first exits the stage in "Visiting the Mouse," he says "...Kuang Zhong enters the role of the premier, I will emerge as the general." When exiting the stage, his steps are vigorous and his will is firm, making us see that his purpose is not to escape, not to disappear from then on, but to come back in a few days. When Kuang Zhong first enters the stage, we can see how he tests the murderer's psychology (Lou is seeking a sign, Kuang Zhong gently pats him on the shoulder) and how he makes his disguise so that the murderer cannot see through it. In this scene, they always show us very expressive actions. One is secretly and cautiously pretending to be upright and open, and the other is pretending to be playing Jianghu despite being righteous and imposing. Their body movements always find contrast and conflict, but they are also very coordinated and comfortable. They are good at expressing excited emotions in the details of actions, such as in character divination, Lou Ashu is so frightened that he can't breathe because he is seen through, Kuang Zhong fans him a few times, and Lou Ashu is even more panicked and twirls his fingers to show that he is relaxed and fine, but in fact, it is a manifestation of his uneasy heart and the most tense psychological activity.

Fourth, the diction is clear and the syllables are distinct. Their stage language is based on Suzhou dialect, plus the Central Plains rhyme. Northerners seem to find it difficult to understand. Because they are trained in reciting, with clear and distinct ups, downs, pauses, and inflections, the rhythm is strong, powerful, and mellow, so they are good at expressing the thoughts and emotions of the characters. If the stage requires language to have ideology and action, it is impossible to do without artistic processing in pronunciation and articulation.

The above is a discussion of their technical characteristics in performing arts. The reason why they can perform this scene on a simple bench is inseparable from these techniques. Of course, the entire play has this characteristic, and various operas also pay attention to these, but Kunqu opera pays more attention to it. This technique is good, but only by correctly using these techniques in specific experiences of the characters can the power of the technique be brought into play. Any beautiful action design, as long as it deviates from the content, will inevitably fall into the quagmire of formalism. Stage technology is for expressing life, not for practicing skills on stage, not for posing one by one. When we watch a play, we can only see its rules when we consciously analyze these techniques. Since watching a play is feeling, there is no need to put aside the specific life of the play and focus on appreciating the technical characteristics. But we must learn it, and refine it hard; if we want to truly master it, we can only do it if we understand the method of realism in performance, thereby developing it. The good actors of the Kunsu Opera Troupe all do this. In addition to Kuang Zhong and Lou Ashu in "Fifteen Strings of Cash," the image of Yu Gzhi is a creation in opera. The performers of other roles such as Su Shujuan, Xiong Youlan, and Zhou Cen all seriously and earnestly completed the tasks of the roles on stage.

The performance of "Fifteen Strings of Cash" by the Kunsu Opera Troupe has its positive realistic significance. Through the two typical character images of Kuang Zhong and Yu Gzhi, it specifically and vividly illustrates the victory of adhering to practice. The script creation and performance creation, as well as how to use the technical rules of Kunqu opera, all run through this spirit, thereby overcoming the problems of conceptualization and formalism, which is worthy of our learning.

    向“十五贯”的表演艺术学习什么
    阿甲
    昆苏剧团演出的“十五贯”，无论从剧本的教育意义、写作艺术、导演处理、表演创造等各方面来看，都是值得从事戏曲工作者以及话剧工作者很好来学习的。人物刻划得具体，表演上体验得深刻，是这个戏不同于一般戏曲的基本特点。
    从写作上说，如过于执这个角色，属于全剧冲突主要矛盾的一面，这是一个否定人物。可是作者并不是把他写做一个贪赃枉法的酷吏，却是一个执法如山的“清官”；他在审案时似乎既走过群众路线，又掌握了真凭实据；外则察颜观色，内则推测揣摹，他认为这一切都是合乎逻辑的了。只是这种逻辑，不是从实际出发，而是从感觉、愿望出发，于是推理也罢、判断也罢，“逻辑性”愈强，事情的解决愈糟。这种人以清官自居，理直气壮，执法峻严，冤杀了人毫不亏心，这种“清官”实在比赃官害处更大。这个人物有他的典型意义，也有他的现实意义。属于主要矛盾另一面的况钟，作者对这个人物，不是夸夸其谈地来表现这个清官的仗义执言，更不是用怪诞离奇的办法去审查案情，平复沉冤；在“疑鼠”“访鼠”两场戏里，况钟是具体提出问题，具体解决问题的。这里，使我想到在一些戏曲和话剧剧本中，作者喜欢用这样的手法来解决具体问题，即是写人物、写冲突碰到困难的时候，往往就将这种解决困难的复杂过程和要求，巧妙地布置在后台，然后回到台前借剧中人的口说一说事情的结果，就算把问题交代了。“十五贯”不是这样的，它写况钟，不是要他躲在后台逃避困难，而是把他拉在台前，要他面对矛盾，当场解决问题。请看“疑鼠”中的“勘察”，“访鼠”中的“测字”，都是将疑难暴露在台前，看你采取什么态度去解决？或则是实事求是的态度，或则是自以为是的态度。他在勘察中发现一个钱，可是他只是把它当作这一案情重要的线索，并不是把它当做解决全案最后的定断。最后的定断和结论，是从血迹、一两枚铜钱、赌博的骰子、绣花的钱袋、群众的答对、甚至直接在凶手的嘴里追查出来的。这个人物确实可爱，他不仅仗义执言威武不屈，表现了坚持真理的顽强性和崇高品质，而且表现了严肃认真、细致周密的工作作风。这个人物和过于执相对，有他的典型意义，也有他的现实意义。
    关于“十五贯”剧本方面的特点，在这里不做全面的研究，只谈这么一点。这里，谈谈表演艺术上的问题。剧本的现实主义的创作丰富了表演艺术，同时表演上的现实主义创造又把剧本的内容揭示得更深刻了。在“判斩”、“见都”、“疑鼠”、“访鼠”这些场子里，表演上都是精彩的，每一场都有它的特点，这里只谈谈“访鼠”这场戏。
    娄阿鼠是一个恶毒而又十分机警的流氓，假如说，扮演这个角色的演员在创造人物形象中要选择核心的话，鼠，就是表现这一种人最好的核心。但是王传淞所扮演的这一丑角，也并非一切务求鼠化，单纯去摹仿老鼠的形体动作，而只是在体验这个流氓心理活动中借用老鼠那种机敏狡诈的特性来帮助他完成角色的形象创造而已。娄阿鼠并不是昼伏夜出真正胆小如鼠的人。你看，他杀了尤葫芦，不是逃跑，而是回到尤葫芦家观察，在群众中制造舆论，帮助公差捉人，站在公堂作证，歌颂过于执的英明果断，他想尽办法促成这件案子及早解决，好让自己轻松愉快、逍遥法外。这是娄阿鼠的目的。直到况钟翻案勘察，他才看风转舵。他一直是在想办法的。他一方下乡住上几天，暂且避避风头，一方打听风声另谋对策。娄阿鼠心里，自然是很害怕的，他一忽儿嚷着“为人不做亏心事，半夜敲门不吃惊，”一忽儿又在嚷嚷“心惊肉跳，坐卧不安”。这种强烈的内心活动，剧本写得并不够突出，可是王传淞抓紧了这些环节，贯串动作很明确，把这个人物就演活了。周传瑛所饰况钟，在表演上是十分成功的。况钟所处的情境很紧张，在都院限定的时间里，必须把翻案的疑难彻底解决。“访鼠”，是解决全案最后的环节，在况钟看来，问题愈接近解决，就应愈加谨慎。他和凶手娄阿鼠见面时，感情是很复杂的；表面上是在测字解嘲、谈笑风生，心里却非常愤怒，真想马上把这个杀人犯上起枷来；但他的任务是要把这件案子在娄阿鼠身上毫不牵强附会地做出可靠的结论来，所以他的态度又是十分严肃认真的。周传瑛按照况钟所处的情景，把自己的表演才能和熟练的技巧，同角色的思想逻辑有机地结合一起，来完成“私访”的表演任务，并不是一般地从清官私访这个概念出发，所以把这个人物就演活了。
    周传瑛表演“访鼠”这场戏，使人看出是有他的导演构图轮廓的（他也是这个戏的导演之一），这个构图，表现在况钟对待娄阿鼠采用一擒一纵的方法。你看，况钟对娄阿鼠，总是先用一针见血的话刺他一下，到这个凶手十分恐惧、惊慌失措的时候，又用宽心话使他解除包袱，使他有路可走。因为况钟知道把事情搞得太紧张了就很难把问题再深谈下去。这场戏在构图上有如猫逮耗子那样一抓一放地在动作着、玩弄着，直到狡猾的娄阿鼠完全就范为止。这场戏在斗争的双方来说，况钟是主动的，娄阿鼠是被动的。但娄并非退缩不前，而是积极在想主意；可是他越是信服测字的灵验，就越感到命运的不可挣脱。如他一经况钟点到节骨眼，总是抑制恐惧，强颜作笑，勉强地将况钟嘲笑一番，我们可以看出这个狡猾的凶手，一面希望测字先生为他解决疑难，指示迷途，逢凶化吉；一面却又害怕别人猜透他的心思，即是说：他要求测字测得准，但又害怕测得准。这样的心理冲突，推动了戏的发展。周传瑛的戏也是很有趣的，他扮演况钟，况钟再扮演测字先生。从况钟的扮演来说，他在阿鼠面前，处处要抑制愤怒的感情，时刻要提防流露出官家的气度，从测字先生的态度来说，又怕装得虚假过火，使狡猾的凶手不敢信托。娄阿鼠是赌场混混的人，他对跑跑码头的江湖先生，未必毫无戒忌，只有叫况钟真正表演出江湖义气，所谓“四海之内皆朋友也”他才相信你，肯把性命交给你，把你当做“救命王菩萨”。
    以上，只是说明两个演员在这场戏中所以演得那么精彩，使我们理解到主要是由于他们能够正确去掌握人物的行为逻辑，深刻地去理解人物的心理活动的结果。这当然是极重要的，但这里还应该谈谈这场戏技术上的特长。只有内心分析而不讲究表演技术，或者认为有了内心体验、有了充沛的感情，自然就能相应地产生出优美的、很有说服力的外形动作来，这实在是害人的说法。这场戏只有两个人，没有什么舞台调度，两个人坐在一张条凳上做戏，没有唱，没有吹胡子瞪眼的激情，只是在那里清谈，在那里思索，在那里判断，在那里试探、观察。这样一点一滴地把戏交代的清清楚楚，将我们吸引在剧中人的情景之中，和他们一同感受、一同呼吸。为什么能够这样吸引人呢？这里要谈谈昆曲的技术问题，也是表现力问题。当然，这里很难用记录式的方法将两个演员的动作谱详细无遗地记录下来，也无此必要。我们只从技术规律的角度来提出些问题。这不是要我们在表演时从技术出发，而是希望我们重视这些问题，学习这些经验。
    第一、动作明确，层次分清。我们谈到技术，或谈到艺术作品时，往往要求有分寸感，要求色彩鲜明、线条清楚。这两位演员就做到了这一点，他们无论一举手，一投足，都是很有分寸、很有准确性，层次分明的。例如当两手运动时，尽管过程复杂，总是干干净净，不是叫你看得来眼花撩乱。不像有些戏曲演员，在运动时把几个动作齐起齐落，没有起伏；或者把这个动作遮盖了那个动作，没有距离、没有透视，没有参差；或者动作只有圆润的一面，缺少顿挫的一面；或者大轮廓还准确，小动作却不精密。这两位昆剧演员却不是这样，在他们身上，能在最细微的动作线中表现出动律的颜色。中国水墨画讲究墨分五色，他们的动作也是如此，就是能在最单调的色调中再分出层次来。这样，表现细致的感情，微妙的心理就有了办法。
    第二、动作线联贯不断。有些演员，在唱的时候或道白的时候，就在那里拼命做身段，这样比划，那样比划；一到唱完了、讲完了，动作也完了。等到再唱再讲时才再开始动作起来，好像牵线木偶一样。周传瑛和王传淞的表演就不是这样，他们的动作衔接得紧，没有脱节的地方；不是这只手举起那只手孤立不动，不是手臂动手腕不动，手腕动手指不动。比如挑髯、飞袖、撩袍、端带、甚至眼睛一眨，眉毛一抬都是贯串一气、有机联系的。有些大身段的特技也是如此，如况钟讲到“那家人家可是姓尤”，娄阿鼠一听此话，一个倒栽葱后马上从凳底下窜出，然后又跳到凳上学老鼠偷油的样子，这些动作虽分段落，却是一气呵成的，不是分割开的。动作的联系贯串，并不像枯藤缠老树那样非死死地纠缠一起不可，而是若接若离的，有时形断了，势没有断。掌握了这些技术，在外形上克服僵硬刻板的毛病就有了办法。
    第三、动作姿势有选择，有表现力。戏曲舞台上很讲究身段，要求使观众面面看到，并且在任何一个角度都是好看的。开幕、落幕、上场下场，都应在动作身段上看出角色的目的。比如娄阿鼠在“访鼠”第一次下场时说“……况钟入相、我再出将”，下场时脚步矫健，意志坚定，使我们看出他的目的不是要逃跑、不是从此消声匿迹，而是等几天再来。况钟初上场时，就看出他是如何去测验凶手的心理，（娄正在求签，况钟在他肩上轻轻一拍）又如何使自己的化装不叫凶手看出。他们在这场戏里，总是将很有表现力的动作给我们看。一个是鬼鬼祟祟反而装成光明磊落，一个是正气迫人反而装成游戏江湖。他们的身段，总是找对比、找冲突、但又是很协调很舒服的。他们善于在动作细节上表现激动的感情，如测字中娄阿鼠因被识透心事吓得喘不过气来，况钟为他扇了几扇，而娄阿鼠则更加惊惶失措以两个手指打转转以表示轻松无事，实则是心虚不安、最紧张的心理活动的流露。
    第四、读词口齿清楚，音节分明。他们的舞台语言，是苏白底子，加上中州韵调，北方人似乎不易听懂。由于他们念词有训练，抑、扬、顿、挫，色彩鲜明，听起来节奏很强、有力量、也很圆润，因而善于表达人物的思想情感。如果说在舞台上要求语言有思想性、动作性，在吐音、咬字上没有艺术加工是不行的。
    以上，是谈他们在表演艺术上技术上的特长。他们在一张简简单单的条凳上所以能表演出这场戏来的原因是和这些技术分不开的，当然整个戏都具有这种特长，各种戏曲也都讲究这些，而昆曲讲究得更到家些。这种技术是好的，但只有在具体体验角色正确运用这些技术时才能发挥技术的力量，任何漂亮动作的设计，只要一离开内容就必然陷入形式主义的泥沼。舞台上的技术是为了表现生活，不是在台上练工，不是一个个地摆架子。我们看戏，只有当自觉地去分析这些技术时才能看出它的规律，既然看戏是感受，那就不需要撇开戏的具体生活而去专心欣赏技术的特长。但是我们必须要学习它，你可以用你自己的办法去学习它。戏曲中的技术规律，是无数老前辈从生活体验中、从舞台体验中经验的总结，它凝聚了各色各样人的性格和情感，但它是抽象的，概念性的，它是结果，不能当作我们创作人物的出发点，不能拿来就套。但必须学它，苦苦地炼它；如要真正掌握它，只有在表演上懂得现实主义的方法始能做到，从而也就发展了它，昆苏剧团的好演员，都是这样去做的。“十五贯”中除况钟、娄阿鼠外，如过于执的形象，是戏曲中的一种创造，其余如苏戍娟、熊友兰、周岑等角色的扮演者在舞台上都是认真严肃完成了角色的任务的。
    昆苏剧团“十五贯”的演出，是有它积极的现实意义的，它通过况钟、过于执两种典型的人物形象，具体生动地说明了坚持实践的胜利；剧本创作和表演创作以及如何去运用昆曲上的技术规律也都贯串着这种精神，因而也就克服了概念化、形式主义的毛病，这是值得我们学习的。
