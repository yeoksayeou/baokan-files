　　Earnestly Promote the Experiences Exchanged at the Advanced Producer Representative Conference
　　Railway Ministry's Various Business Bureaus Formulate Plans for Promoting Advanced Experiences
    After the closing of the National Railway Advanced Producer Representative Conference, the National Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union assisted the 19 business bureaus of the Ministry of Railways in formulating plans for promoting advanced experiences within this year, based on the 203 major advanced experiences exchanged at this conference.
    The promotion plans formulated by the various business bureaus of the Ministry of Railways this time all put forward specific targets. For example, when the Locomotive Bureau planned to promote the experience of the Wang Shichang locomotive dispatching group of the Dalian Branch of the Shenyang Railway Administration in implementing a named locomotive turnaround chart, it proposed that by the end of 1956, the number of locomotives operating according to the named locomotive turnaround chart should reach more than 60% of all freight locomotives. The Rolling Stock Bureau plans to achieve a freight car qualification rate of 100%, eliminate all liability accidents, and reduce the number of vehicles scrapped for repair to 70% of the 1955 level by promoting the experiences of the Guo Gongli group of the Harbin Train Repair Shop and other units.
    The plans of the various business bureaus have all formulated technical and organizational measures to ensure the realization of the plans. Only the Rolling Stock Bureau and other eight bureaus have stipulated that in the implementation of advanced experience measures, seven national advanced experience trainings, twenty-eight advanced experience demonstration performances, twenty-one advanced experience exchange meetings, and two national exhibitions will be held. At the same time, it is planned to incorporate more than ten advanced experiences into regulations, and it is stipulated that the implementation of advanced experiences should be checked regularly. The various business bureaus also printed a batch of pamphlets on advanced experiences and distributed them to relevant units.
    Now, the various bureaus are starting to carry out work according to the plan. The Locomotive Bureau, the Telecommunications Bureau, and others are preparing to organize advanced producers to exchange experiences in various places. Leading cadres and engineering and technical personnel of the Civil Engineering Bureau have already gone to the Pingshi Civil Engineering Section of the Guangzhou Railway Administration to organize a national advanced experience exchange meeting on subgrade maintenance.

　　认真推广先进生产者代表会议上交流的经验
　　铁道部各业务局制定推广先进经验的规划
    全国铁路先进生产者代表会议闭幕以后，中国铁路工会全国委员会协助铁道部十九个业务局根据这个会议上交流的203种主要的先进经验，分别制定了在今年内推广先进经验的规划。
    铁道部各业务局这次制定的推广先进经验的规划中，都提出了具体的指标。如机务局在规划推广沈阳铁路管理局大连分局王世昌机车调度小组推行记名式机车周转图的经验的时候，就提出到1956年底要使按记名式机车周转图运行的机车达到全部货运机车的60％以上。车辆局计划通过推广哈尔滨列车检修所郭公利小组等单位的经验，使货车合格率达到100％，消灭一切责任事故，使甩车修理的车辆数目减少到1955年的70％。
    各业务局的规划中都制定了保证实现规划的技术组织措施。仅车务等八个局在推行先进经验措施中，就规定要举办七次全路性的先进经验训练，二十八次先进经验示范表演，二十一次先进经验交流会和两次全国性的展览。同时计划把十多种先进经验纳入规章，并且规定定期检查先进经验推行情况。各业务局还印了一批先进经验的小册子发给有关单位。
    现在，各局正着手根据规划开展工作。机务局、电务局等正在筹备组织先进生产者到各地交流经验。工务局领导干部和工程技术人员已经前往广州铁路管理局坪石工务段组织召开全国路基维修先进经验交流会。（郑鹏）
