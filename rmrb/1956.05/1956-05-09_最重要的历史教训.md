　　The Most Important Historical Lesson
　　Eleven years have passed since the great alliance of freedom-loving people, led by the Soviet Union, the United States, and Great Britain, completely crushed the Hitlerite aggressors. The victory of the people in the Second World War over the dark forces of fascist reaction was an event of world historical significance. This victory fundamentally changed the world situation, enabling many countries and peoples to choose new paths of development and determining the long-term destiny of all mankind. This most important lesson bestowed by history has special significance in the events that have occurred in the post-war period.
　　In order to face the future with confidence, one must be good at drawing correct conclusions from the harsh lessons of the past. All those who do not want the tragedy of war to be repeated, all those who sincerely wish to maintain and consolidate world peace, are now concerned about this issue. At present, it is particularly important to avoid repeating past mistakes, because the advocates of the "policy of strength" have not abandoned their attempts to hinder the establishment of mutual understanding and peaceful cooperation between the peoples of the East and the West. At the same time, people are drawing closer and uniting around a common desire – to not allow a new, more destructive world conflict.
　　The liberation war against the fascist aggressors required tremendous efforts from the Soviet people and the people of other countries in the anti-Hitler alliance. Fascist aggression brought unprecedented suffering to the people, and the victory in the anti-fascist war was achieved at a great sacrifice. The main burden of fighting against the ferocious war machine of German militarism fell on the shoulders of the Soviet people. The immortal merits of the Soviet people will forever remain in the memory of mankind: the Soviet people and their heroic armed forces undertook the task of delivering the main blow to the Hitlerite aggressors, and gloriously defended the freedom and independence of their motherland in this most arduous war. The Soviet Union made unparalleled contributions to the cause of liberating many countries and peoples from fascist enslavement.
　　The Soviet people will never forget the efforts made and the sacrifices suffered by the people of all countries in the anti-Hitler alliance (whether large or small) in the years of the common struggle against the fascist aggressors. The Soviet people assess the role played by the people and armed forces of the United States and Great Britain in crushing Hitlerite Germany based on their merits. It was precisely the combat cooperation of the countries in the anti-Hitler alliance and their joint efforts that guaranteed the victory of the war. Their cooperation, tempered in the flames of war and consolidated by the blood shed jointly by the people in the struggle against aggression, created a solid foundation for ensuring lasting world peace.
　　The Soviet people are deeply convinced that this healthy foundation for joint action for the sake of peace still exists today. Indeed, if the countries of the anti-Hitler alliance (although their social systems are different) were able to cooperate victoriously in the cause of repelling the fascist aggressors, then why can't they now unite their forces to prevent a new war and ensure universal security? The close cooperation formed during the war by the three great powers, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Great Britain (later joined by France), laid the cornerstone for the United Nations Organization. Now, under conditions of constantly easing international tensions, the role of the United Nations, which is charged with ensuring peaceful cooperation between countries, is further enhanced.
　　The entire course of the international situation in the post-war period clearly shows that abandoning the principles of equal cooperation in the war years has not brought any benefits. Certain groups in Western countries have tried to ignore the experience of the Second World War, and they are unwilling to heed the historically significant changes that have taken place in the world. These groups in Western countries have attempted to force other countries to accept one-sided decisions on international issues through the so-called "policy of strength," and all of this has cost humanity an extremely high price. The result of this policy is the "Cold War," an arms race that is dangerous and burdensome for the people of all countries, and the establishment of exclusive military blocs by certain countries aimed at opposing the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries. Mankind faces the danger of a new world war that will be even more bloody and destructive.
　　Recently, an increasingly wider range of people around the world have recognized the baselessness and bankruptcy of the "policy of strength." The policy of peaceful coexistence among all countries (regardless of their social systems) advocated by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, India, and many other countries has received increasing support throughout the world. The fact that the most complex issues in international relations can be resolved through negotiations if all parties concerned can express their willingness to cooperate and consult with each other for the sake of peace has been increasingly recognized internationally. The Geneva Four-Power Summit Conference and the many other meetings and personal contacts between activists from Eastern and Western countries have shown that the method of negotiation can and should become the only method for resolving international issues.
　　Those who soberly assess the lessons of the Second World War will not be surprised by this development in the international situation. It should be known that the defeat of the fascist aggressors showed that attempts to adopt a "policy of strength" against the Soviet Union and other freedom-loving countries will bring dangerous consequences to the supporters of this policy. Those who regarded the peace-loving nature of the Soviet state as a sign of its weakness were greatly mistaken. The war against the Hitlerite occupiers showed the world the rock-solid nature of the Soviet system and the unshakable nature of the alliance of workers and peasants and the friendship of all the nationalities of the Soviet Union. The Soviet people, united around their long-tested leader – the Communist Party, bravely and tenaciously repelled the perfidious attack of the aggressors and achieved victory.
　　The rapid recovery of the Soviet Union's war-torn economy, and the subsequent vigorous growth of the national economy, is a new proof of the superiority of the socialist system. At present, the Soviet Union is in a period of strength and prosperity, and the socialist economy is more consolidated than ever before. The powerful Soviet armed forces, equipped with the latest technology, protect the peaceful labor of the Soviet people. The Soviet Union, which unswervingly defends the cause of peace, is no longer alone. Shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet people stand the great Chinese people and the people of other countries who have embarked on the path of socialist development. Many European and Asian countries, which base their foreign policy on the principle of non-participation in military blocs, have emerged on the world stage. As a result, a vast "peace zone" has been formed on the earth, which includes many socialist and non-socialist countries in Europe and Asia.
　　What basis is there to expect the "policy of strength" to succeed under the present conditions? Wouldn't it be more correct to think the opposite? But the supporters of this type of policy continue to stubbornly cling to this policy, which has long been outdated and bankrupt in the eyes of the people of all countries. The situation that has formed on the German issue is a vivid example of this. The crushing of the aggressive forces of German militarism created a realistic possibility for Germany to develop along a path of peace and democracy. But certain groups in the West, who once regarded Hitler's Wehrmacht as the striking force for attacking the Soviet Union, are now pursuing a policy of reviving German militarism. Armed forces commanded by former Hitlerite generals have been re-established in West Germany. This policy is clearly fundamentally contrary to the interests of European security and the national interests of the German people themselves. Undoubtedly, this policy will be defeated.
　　The experience of the Second World War fully confirms the vitality and justice of the Soviet Union's policy of cooperation between countries with different social and political systems. The experience of international relations in the post-war period also confirms that peaceful coexistence and peaceful cooperation are the only way for the people of all countries to accept the development of international relations. Under the present conditions, there is no other way out. Only under conditions of peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between the two systems can mankind be spared the threat of war and can its labor serve the peaceful progress and prosperity of all countries.

　　最重要的历史教训
    自从以苏联、美国、英国为首的爱好自由人民的伟大同盟彻底粉碎了希特勒侵略者的日子到现在，已经过去十一年了。人民在第二次世界大战中对黑暗的法西斯反动势力的胜利，是具有世界历史意义的事件。这个胜利根本改变了世界局势，使得许多国家和人民能够选择新的发展道路，并且确定了全人类长远的命运。历史所赋与的这个最重要的教训，在战后期间发生的事件中具有特殊的意义。
    为了满怀信心地正视未来，就应当善于从过去严酷的教训中得出正确的结论。凡是不希望战争悲剧重演的人，凡是真心愿意维护和巩固世界和平的人，现在都关心这个问题。就目前来说，避免过去错误的重演特别重要，因为现在“实力政策”的拥护者还没有放弃阻碍建立东方和西方人民间相互谅解和和平合作的企图。而同时，人民却为了一个共同的愿望——不允许新的、有更大破坏性的世界冲突——日益靠近和团结起来。
    反法西斯侵略者的解放战争要求苏联人民和其他反对希特勒联盟的国家的人民作出巨大的努力。法西斯的侵略给人民带来了从来未有的苦难，反法西斯战争的胜利付出了巨大的牺牲。进行反对德国军国主义凶恶战争机器的斗争的主要重担落到了苏联人肩上。在人类的记忆中永远留着苏联人民的不朽的功勋：苏联人民和他们的英勇的武装力量，担起了给希特勒侵略者以主要打击的任务，在这次最艰苦的战争中，光荣地捍卫了祖国的自由和独立。苏联在把许多国家和人民从法西斯奴役中解放出来的事业中作出了无比的贡献。
    苏联人民永远不会忘记反希特勒同盟的各国人民（无论是大国还是小国的人民）在反对法西斯侵略者的共同斗争的岁月里所作的努力和遭到的牺牲。苏联人民根据功绩来估价美国和英国的人民和武装力量在粉碎希特勒德国中所起的作用。正因为反希特勒同盟各国的战斗的合作，它们共同的努力才保证了战争的胜利。它们在战火中锻炼出来的、为人民在反侵略斗争中共同流出的鲜血所巩固了的合作，为保证世界持久和平创造了实在的基础。
    苏联人深信，这种为了和平的利益而共同行动的健康的基础现在仍然存在。的确，如果反希特勒同盟各国（虽然它们的社会制度不相同）曾在反击法西斯侵略者的事业中能够胜利地合作，那么为什么现在它们就不能够联合起自己的力量来防止新战争和保证普遍的安全呢？苏联、美国和英国这三个大国在战争期间形成的紧密合作（后来，法国也参加了这种合作）曾为联合国组织奠定了基石。现在，在国际紧张局势不断缓和的条件下，负有保证各国之间和平合作使命的联合国的作用是更加提高了。
    战后时期国际局势的整个进程明显地表明，放弃战争年代的平等合作的原则并没有带来任何好处。西方国家某些集团力图忽视第二次世界大战的经验，他们不愿意理会世界所发生的历史意义的变化。西方国家这些集团企图借助于所谓“实力政策”强使其他国家接受对国际问题的片面决定，这一切都使人类支付了极昂贵的代价。这种政策的结果是“冷战”、对各国人民说来是危险而负担沉重的军备竞赛、目的在于反对苏联和其他爱好和平国家的某些国家的排他性军事集团的建立。人类面临着流血更多和毁灭性更大的新世界大战的危险。
    近来，越来越广泛的世界人士都认识到“实力政策”的毫无根据和破产。苏联、中华人民共和国、印度和其他许多国家坚持的各个国家（不问它们的社会制度如何）和平共处的政策得到全世界越来越大的支持。如果所有的当事国都能为了和平的利益而表示互相合作和协商的意愿，那末，国际关系中最复杂的问题都可以通过谈判的途径解决，这一事实已越来越得到国际上的承认。日内瓦四国政府首脑会议以及东西方国家的活动家的其他许多会见和个人接触，表明了谈判的方法能够而且应当成为解决国际问题的唯一方法。
    那些清醒地评价第二次世界大战教训的人是不会对国际局势的这种发展感到惊讶的。要知道，法西斯侵略者的失败表明，企图采取“实力政策”来反对苏联及其他爱好自由的国家，将给这种政策的拥护者带来危险的后果。那些把苏维埃国家的爱好和平当作它软弱的表现的人是大大失算了。反对希特勒占领者的战争向全世界显示了苏维埃制度的坚如磐石，显示了工农联盟和苏联各民族友谊的不可动摇。苏联人民团结在自己久经考验的领导者——共产党的周围，勇敢而顽强地击退了侵略者背信弃义的进攻，并且取得了胜利。
    苏联被战争破坏的经济的迅速恢复，以及接踵而来的国民经济的蓬勃增长，是社会主义制度优越性的新的证明。目前苏联是在强盛繁荣时期，社会主义经济比以前任何时候都更巩固了。以最新技术装备起来的强大的苏联武装力量保卫着苏联人的和平劳动。坚持不懈地保卫和平事业的苏联，现在已经不是孤单的了。同苏联人民肩并着肩，出现了走上社会主义发展道路的伟大的中国人民和其他国家的人民。以不参加军事集团这一原则为自己外交政策基础的许多欧洲和亚洲国家在世界舞台上出现了。其结果是在地球上形成了广大的“和平地区”，它包括欧洲和亚洲的许多社会主义国家和非社会主义国家。
    有什么根据指望在现时条件下“实力政策”能获得成功？反过来想不是更正确些吗？但是这类政策的拥护者却在继续顽固地抓住这个在各国人民眼中早已过时和破产了的政策。在德国问题上形成的局势就是这方面的一个鲜明的例子。德国军国主义侵略势力的被粉碎，为德国沿着和平民主的道路发展创造了现实的可能性。但是当年曾把希特勒的国防军看作是进攻苏联的突击力量的西方某些集团，现在又在推行复活德国军国主义的政策。在西德已重新建立了由前希特勒将领指挥的武装部队。这种政策显然是同欧洲安全的利益，同德国人民本身的民族利益根本抵触的。无疑地，这种政策必将遭受失败。
    第二次世界大战的经验充分地证实了苏联所奉行的社会和政治制度不同的各国实行合作的政策的生命力和正义性。战后时期国际关系的经验也证实，和平共处和和平合作是各国人民可以接受的发展国际关系的唯一道路。在现时条件下，其他出路是没有的。只有在两种制度和平共处和和平竞赛的条件下，人类才能免于战争的威胁，并使自己的劳动为各国人民的和平进步和繁荣服务。
