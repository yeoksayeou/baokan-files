    Cultivating Corn Seedlings with "Nutrient Blocks"
    In Yibin City, Sichuan Province, agricultural production cooperatives are universally using "nutrient blocks" to cultivate corn seedlings, which have already grown into tender shoots three to four inches tall. The Huangjueping Agricultural Production Cooperative has grown vigorous double-stalk corn in its 80,000 "nutrient blocks." These corn plants will be transplanted into the fields after the wheat harvest.
    Using "nutrient blocks" to cultivate corn seedlings for transplanting can increase land utilization. It advances the corn planting season from after the wheat harvest to before the wheat harvest, shortening the corn's growing period in the field by about forty days. This allows for the continued planting of a late-season corn crop and a season of autumn sweet potatoes after the corn harvest, achieving three or four harvests a year and enabling an average yield of over 800 jin per mu.
    The method for making "nutrient blocks" is not complicated. Mix soil, human and animal manure, and plant ash into fist-sized mud blocks. Place a few corn seeds on each mud block, then cover with soil and manure, and water frequently to keep them moist. Once the wheat is harvested, they can be transplanted immediately.

    用“营养坯”培育玉米苗
    四川宜宾市农业生产合作社普遍用“营养坯”培育的玉米苗，已生长出三、四寸高的嫩苗。黄桷坪农业生产合作社的八万个“营养坯”都长起茁壮的双株玉米。这些玉米将在麦收后移栽到田野里。
    用“营养坯”培育移栽玉米苗可提高土地利用率，把玉米播种期从麦收后提早到麦收前进行，使玉米在地里的生长期缩短四十天左右，这样玉米收割后，还可以继续栽种一季晚玉米和一季秋红薯，达到一年三、四熟，使每亩平均产量达八百斤以上。
    “营养坯”做法并不复杂。把泥土、人畜粪、草木灰等做成拳头大小的混合泥坯，每块泥坯上点颗玉米种子，然后盖上土粪，经常浇水保持湿润，等麦子一收便可立即移栽。
