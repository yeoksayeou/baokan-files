    Collecting Guqin Music
    More than thirty guqin pieces circulating among the people in our country, played only by a few, have been collected by Cha Fuxi, Standing Director of the Chinese Musicians Association and guqin player, and Xu Jian and Wang Di, cadres of the Institute of National Music of the Central Conservatory of Music.
    Starting in mid-April, Cha Fuxi and others listened to guqin players performing many pieces in Jinan, Nanjing, Yangzhou, Suzhou, and other places. They also held discussions with guqin players on issues such as guqin scores and instruments. The "Youlan" played by a guqin player in Shanghai was considered a piece worth paying attention to. It is a score passed down from the Tang Dynasty and has rarely been played for hundreds of years. This guqin piece, along with many others, has been recorded.
    Cha Fuxi and others left Shanghai for Hangzhou on the 17th. They will continue to collect guqin music in Wuhan, Chongqing, Chengdu, Guiyang, Xi'an, and other places.

    收集古琴曲
    三十多首在我国民间流传只有少数人会演奏的古琴曲，已经由中国音乐家协会常务理事、古琴家查阜西和中央音乐学院民族音乐研究所干部许健、王迪收集起来。
    查阜西等从四月中旬开始，在济南、南京、扬州、苏州等地，听古琴家们演奏了许多曲子。他们还和古琴家们就古琴的曲谱、乐器等问题进行了座谈。上海古琴家演奏的“幽兰”被认为是一首值得重视的曲子。它是唐代的传谱，几百年来很少有人演奏。这首古琴曲已经和其他许多曲子一起录了音。
    查阜西等在十七日离开上海前往杭州。他们还将在武汉、重庆、成都、贵阳、西安等地继续收集古琴曲。
