Cantonese Opera and Shanghai Opera Performances in Beijing Receive Widespread Attention
Capital Theatrical Circles Hold Separate Symposiums on These Two Dramatic Forms

　　The traditional repertoire "Sou Shu Yuan" performed by the Guangdong Cantonese Opera Troupe in the capital has won widespread praise. The Chinese Dramatists Association held a Cantonese Opera symposium on the 19th. Those attending included Xia Yan, Vice Minister of Culture, and Tian Han, Ye Gongchuo, Ma Shizeng, Hong Xiannv, Yi Bing, Xu Tao, Zhang Zhen, and more than 40 others. At the meeting, everyone agreed that since the First National Opera Performance, the reform work of Cantonese Opera has made great progress and achievements. "Sou Shu Yuan" has high achievements in all aspects, including playwrighting, directing, performance, music, and stage art. At the same time, it was pointed out that Cantonese Opera is one of the local opera types in our country with a rich tradition, and in the future, we should continue to focus on exploring and sorting out traditional repertoires. While boldly absorbing the advantages of other art forms, the original beautiful style of Cantonese Opera should never be destroyed.
　　After the Shanghai Yihua Shanghai Opera Troupe recently performed "Ode to the Heroes of the Jialing River," "Torrent," which reflects real life, and the traditional repertoire "Meeting at the Nunnery" in the capital, it aroused the attention of the capital's theatrical circles. The Chinese Dramatists Association held a symposium on the 18th. Those present included Liu Zhiming, Vice Minister of Culture, playwrights Tian Han, Zhang Geng, Bai Yunsheng, Yi Bing, and more than 30 others. At the meeting, everyone affirmed the achievements of Shanghai Opera in developing modern dramas. At the same time, it is hoped that Shanghai Opera can further develop, inherit more of the excellent traditions of national opera in performance art, maintain the characteristics of this opera type, and continuously improve artistic quality; and enrich and diversify the repertoires performed.

    首都戏剧界分别开会座谈这两个剧种
    广东粤剧团在首都演出的传统剧目“搜书院”，博得了广泛的赞赏。中国戏剧家协会在十九日举行粤剧座谈会。到会的有文化部副部长夏衍和田汉、叶恭绰、马师曾、红线女、伊兵、徐韬、张真等四十多人。会上，大家认为自从全国第一届戏曲会演以来，粤剧的改革工作有很大的进展和收获。“搜书院”在编剧、导演、表演、音乐、舞台美术等各方面都有很高的成就。同时也指出粤剧是我国有着丰富传统的地方剧种之一，今后应继续着重发掘和整理传统的剧目，在勇于吸取其他艺术形式的优点的同时，决不应该破坏粤剧原有的优美风格。
    上海市艺华沪剧团最近在首都演出了反映现实生活的“嘉陵江英雄赞歌”、“激流”和传统剧目“庵堂相会”以后，引起了首都戏剧界的重视。中国戏剧家协会在十八日举行了座谈会。出席的有文化部刘芝明副部长、戏剧家田汉、张庚、白云生、伊兵等三十余人。会上，大家肯定了沪剧在发展现代剧上的成绩。同时也希望沪剧能够进一步发展，在表演艺术上，更多地继承民族戏曲的优秀传统，保持本剧种的特色，不断地提高艺术质量；并且使上演的剧目更加丰富多样。
