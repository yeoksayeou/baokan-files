    A Good Beginning
    By Li He, Hu Sisheng, Our Correspondents in the Soviet Union
    The four-day Franco-Soviet talks have concluded. On the evening of the 19th, the signing ceremony of the Franco-Soviet talks declaration was held in the Grand Kremlin Palace. After Bulganin and Mollet signed, the leaders of the two countries shook hands to congratulate each other. What people see here is not only a symbol of Franco-Soviet friendship, but also a sign of the growing expansion of the idea of peaceful coexistence.
    At the signing ceremony in the Grand Kremlin Palace, when French Prime Minister Mollet spoke of the smooth conclusion of the affairs of the leaders of France and the Soviet Union, Comrade Khrushchev added that this was not the end, but the beginning, a good beginning. Indeed, the talks between the leaders of France and the Soviet Union, conducted in a sincere and friendly atmosphere, reached a consensus on some major issues, and the two countries also reached unanimous agreements on developing Franco-Soviet economic and cultural relations. Although the two governments have different viewpoints and disagree on some issues, these agreements are definitely a new step forward on the road to easing tensions. Naturally, all these good beginnings must be consolidated and developed to bring practical and positive effects to the people of both countries and the cause of international peace. Bulganin raised a glass in the Kremlin to congratulate Franco-Soviet friendship and cooperation, saying: The people of France and the Soviet Union, who are watching the Moscow talks with great interest, are now awaiting concrete actions after the talks. As for the Soviet government, it will do its best to do everything conducive to the consolidation and development of Franco-Soviet friendship and cooperation, and will never do anything to dim the relations between the two countries. Bulganin expressed the hope that the French government would act in the same spirit.
    It is no accident that the declaration mentioned new ways to develop trade between the two countries in considerable detail. Trade between France and the Soviet Union has a long tradition. As early as 1934, the two countries signed a trade agreement. In the implementation of the agreement, the Soviet Union exported grain, timber, oil and petroleum products, ore, and machinery to France, while France exported ferrous and non-ferrous metals, electrical equipment, machinery, and precision instruments to the Soviet Union. World War II temporarily interrupted this mutually beneficial trade. However, as soon as the war ended, the two countries resumed trade agreements. By 1946, the value of goods exported by the Soviet Union to France reached 152.2 million rubles. In the following years, it would have been possible to continue developing this exchange, but with the so-called "embargo" policy shackling France, trade gradually decreased. With the emergence of new atmospheres in international relations and the increasing demands of people from all walks of life in France, the volume of trade between the two countries has increased considerably in recent years. By 1954, the trade volume between the two countries rose to 343 million rubles, and there was further growth in 1955. Now the Soviet government has stated that if trade restrictions and discrimination are eliminated, the Soviet Union's purchases of French goods could be increased by three or four times compared to 1955.
    The expansion of exchanges in culture and technology is another gain from the talks. The frequent exchanges of culture between France and the Soviet Union, which have a long history of interaction, can be felt everywhere in Moscow these days: long lines of visitors line up in front of the French book exhibition on Kropotkin Street; on the screens of Moscow cinemas and on television programs, sixteen French films such as "The Red and the Black" are being shown; in Soviet theaters, forty French plays are currently being staged, for example, "Carmen" is being staged in twenty theaters across the country; the performances of French pianists and the programs of French famous pieces performed by Soviet artists have been warmly praised by audiences in Moscow and Leningrad. French scientists are lecturing in Soviet universities. On May 16, the French version of "Moscow News" was published in Moscow. Similarly, in France, exhibitions and performances of Soviet books and movies were held, and the visits and study abroad of Soviet scholars and students are gradually increasing. All this will promote mutual understanding and cooperation between the people of France and the Soviet Union, and will ultimately be conducive to the cause of easing international tensions.
    French public opinion has paid close attention to this Franco-Soviet meeting. Eighty or ninety French journalists came to Moscow to cover the event. Some French people said that the Moscow talks were another nail in the coffin of the "Cold War." However, this does not mean that the believers in the Cold War have already admitted defeat. Indeed, even while the talks were underway, certain French newspapers, such as "Le Figaro," which acted according to the whims of others, were still spreading all kinds of rumors aimed at provoking Franco-Soviet friendship, so, as Khrushchev explained the current "Cold War" during the talks: The "Cold War" makes people think of a person who has died, surrounded by the wailing relatives and friends of the deceased, hoping that the dead will be resurrected, but the corpse remains a corpse. Now people are interested in whether the believers in the "Cold War" will learn some useful lessons from the Franco-Soviet talks.

    良好的开端
    本报驻苏联记者　李何　胡思升
    历时四天的法苏会谈结束了。十九日傍晚，在大克里姆林宫举行了法苏会谈声明的签字仪式。在布尔加宁和摩勒签字后，两国领导人相互握手致贺。人们从这里看到的不仅是法苏友好的象征，而且是和平共处的思想日益扩大的标志。
    在大克里姆林宫的签字仪式上，当法国总理摩勒谈到法苏两国领导人员顺利地结束了自己的事情时，赫鲁晓夫同志补充说，这不是结束，是开始，是良好的开始。的确，法苏两国领导人员在真诚友好的气氛中进行的会谈，在一些重大问题上达成了看法的一致，两国并且在发展法苏两国经济、文化关系等方面取得了一致的协议。尽管两国政府的观点不同、双方在某些问题上意见还不一致，这些协议肯定地是在缓和紧张局势的道路上迈进了新的一步。自然，这一切良好的开端还必须巩固和发展，才能给两国人民和国际和平事业带来实际的和良好的影响。布尔加宁在克里姆林宫举杯祝贺法苏友好合作时说：怀着巨大兴趣注视着莫斯科会谈的法苏两国人民，现在等待着在会谈之后的具体行动。至于苏联政府，它将尽力做一切有利于法苏友好合作巩固和发展的事，绝不做使两国关系暗淡的事。布尔加宁表示希望法国政府也将以同样的精神行事。
    会谈声明中以相当的篇幅提到了发展两国贸易的新的途径，不是偶然的。法苏两国的贸易是有长期的传统的，早在1934年，两国就签订了贸易协定，在协定的执行中，苏联向法国输出谷物、木材、石油和石油制品、矿石以及机器等，法国向苏联输出黑色和有色金属，电气设备、机器、精密仪器等。第二次大战暂时中断了这种互相有利的贸易往来。但是大战一经结束，两国便又恢复了贸易协定，到1946年，苏联向法国输出的货物便达到一亿五千二百万卢布的价值；以后几年中，本来是可以继续发展这种往来的，但是随着压在法国身上的所谓“禁运”政策的束缚，贸易往来就逐渐减少了。随着国际关系中新气象的出现和法国各界人士的要求的增长，最近几年来，两国的贸易额又有不少的增加，到1954年，两国贸易额又上升到三亿四千三百万卢布，1955年有进一步的增长。现在苏联政府表明，如果在贸易方面的限制和歧视取消的话，苏联购买法国的货物能够比1955年增加三、四倍。
    文化和技术等方面交流的扩大是会谈的又一收获。原有悠久的往来的法苏两国文化的交流的频繁，这些天来在莫斯科是到处可以感觉到的：克鲁泡特金大街法国书籍展览会门前排着长长的参观者行列，莫斯科电影院的银幕上和电视节目里，上演着“红与黑”等十六部法国影片；在苏联的戏院里，现在上演着四十个法国剧目，例如“卡尔曼”就在全国二十个戏院中上演；法国钢琴家的演出，由苏联艺术家演奏的法国名曲的节目，受到了莫斯科和列宁格勒观众的热烈赞美。法国科学家在苏联大学校中讲学。五月十六日，莫斯科出版了法文版的“莫斯科新闻”。同样，在法国，也举行了苏联书籍、电影的展览和上演，而苏联学者和学生的访问和留学，也在逐渐增多，这一切都将促进法苏人民的相互了解和合作，而且最终将有利于缓和国际局势的事业。
    法国舆论很注意这次法苏会谈。有八、九十个法国记者到莫斯科来采访。有些法国人说莫斯科会谈是钉在“冷战”棺材上的又一颗钉子。但是，这决不是说，冷战的信徒们已经甘拜下风了。事实也的确如此，在会谈进行中，个别看别人眼色行事的法国报纸如像“费加罗报”还在散播种种挑拨法苏友好和造谣的消息，因此，正如赫鲁晓夫在会谈中给目前“冷战”所作的解释：“冷战”使人仿佛想起一个人死了，周围是嚎啕痛哭的死者亲友，希望死者还生，但是尸体仍然是尸体。现在人们有兴趣的是，“冷战”的信徒们从法苏会谈中是不是会吸取一些有益的教训呢？
