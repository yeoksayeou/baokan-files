Title: Factories under the East China Textile Administration Accumulate Large Sums of Funds

The thirty-plus state-owned textile factories under the East China Textile Administration have remitted enough profit to the state from 1950 to April of this year to build a new textile industrial enterprise equivalent in scale to half of Shanghai's cotton textile industry.

The two main factors in the accumulation of funds by textile factories are increased production and reduced costs. In 1950, each spindle in Shanghai's state-owned cotton textile factories could only spin a little over half a bale of yarn per year. In 1954, the annual output of each spindle was nearly one bale of yarn. Based on this year's planned output, the annual output of each spindle will exceed one bale of yarn. In recent years, the increase in spindle equipment has been less than 1% of the original equipment, while the output of cotton yarn in 1954 increased by more than 70% compared to 1950.

In cotton textile factories, raw cotton costs account for about 75% of the cost. In 1950, it took 410 to 420 catties of raw cotton to spin one bale of yarn. Since 1954, only about 390 catties of raw cotton have been used to spin one bale of yarn. In this way, 20 to 30 catties of raw cotton can be saved per bale of yarn. Taking 1954, when great efforts were made to save cotton, as an example, the raw cotton saved throughout the year could be spun into more than 4,000 bales of yarn.

Since the implementation of planned management in various cotton textile factories, management costs and other expenses have been greatly reduced. In 1954 alone, cost expenses were reduced by 14.17 million yuan. The reduction in the amount of raw cotton used did not reduce the quality of the products.

### 华东纺织管理局所属厂积累大量资金

    华东纺织管理局所属厂积累大量资金
    华东纺织管理局所属的三十多个国营纺织厂，从1950年到今年四月份上缴给国家的利润，可以建设一个规模相当于半个上海棉纺织工业的新的纺织工业企业。
    纺织厂积累资金的两个主要因素是增加产量和降低成本。1950年上海国营棉纺织厂每个纱绽一年只能纺纱半件多，1954年每个纱绽的年产量将近一件纱。以今年的计划产量计算，每个纱绽的年产量将超过一件纱了。几年来，纱绽设备增加不到原有设备的1％，而1954年棉纱的产量比1950年增加了70％以上。
    在棉纺织厂里，原棉费用约占成本比重的75％。1950年纺一件纱要用四百一十到四百二十斤原棉，1954年以来纺一件纱只用原棉三百九十斤左右。这样，每件纱就可节省原棉二十到三十斤。以大力开展节约用棉工作的1954年为例，全年节约的原棉就可以纺成四千多件纱。
    各棉纺织厂实行计划管理以来，管理费用和其他费用都大大减少。单是1954年一年就降低成本费1，417万元。原棉用量的减少，并没有使产品质量降低。
