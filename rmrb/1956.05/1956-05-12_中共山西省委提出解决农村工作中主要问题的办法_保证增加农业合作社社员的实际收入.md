The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued "Instructions (Draft) on Several Major Issues in Current Rural Work," requiring Party committees at all levels in Shanxi to deeply discover and promptly resolve these problems, ensuring that agricultural production cooperatives increase production and guaranteeing an increase in the actual income of agricultural cooperative members.

The instructions pointed out: Production plans of most agricultural cooperatives in the province are set too high. All localities must quickly and carefully conduct a general review and revision of agricultural cooperative production plans, establishing them on a basis that is both advanced and realistically reliable. Based on the revised production plans, financial planning should then be carried out. The primary goal of financial planning is to ensure that the actual income of cooperative members increases by an average of 10% to 20% compared to 1955.

The instructions stipulated the guiding principles for agricultural capital construction: emphasize production-oriented projects and minimize non-production-oriented ones; among production-oriented capital construction projects, emphasis should be placed on those that yield benefits in the current year. The instructions also stipulated that the labor days used by each agricultural cooperative for capital construction should account for only 15% of the total number of agricultural and sideline labor days for the entire cooperative in a year, and should not exceed 20% at most. The labor days used for non-production capital construction should account for only one-tenth of the total labor days used for capital construction.

In response to the problems of oversized organizational structures and extravagance in some agricultural cooperatives, the instructions stipulated the principles for recording labor days in agricultural cooperatives, the number of cadres detached from production, and the total amount of remuneration. It was also stipulated that the administrative management expenses of agricultural cooperatives should not exceed 0.5% of the total income of the cooperative.

The instructions also stipulated: Agricultural production cooperatives must actively develop collectively operated sideline production, and at the same time, help and organize members to engage in sideline production suitable for decentralized operation. First, the production plan of an agricultural cooperative must include a sideline production plan; second, agricultural cooperatives should allow members two months of the year to engage in individual sideline production and other activities; third, the income earned by members from individual sideline production belongs entirely to the individual and does not need to be turned over to the cooperative, nor are labor days recorded for it.

Based on the situation that livestock in many agricultural cooperatives are weak and there have been many deaths, the instructions required Party committees at all levels to quickly solve the problem of fodder and to conduct a general inspection and rectification of livestock feeding management work in agricultural cooperatives. In order to avoid difficulties during distribution, the instructions required all localities to further rectify labor management in agricultural cooperatives in conjunction with spring plowing and sowing, so that all agricultural cooperatives can implement quota management and do a good job in labor planning. The instructions also pointed out: Rectifying the financial management of agricultural cooperatives is an important part of implementing the policy of running cooperatives diligently and frugally. All localities should give full play to the role of accounting instructors and accounting mutual aid networks to quickly rectify the finances of agricultural cooperatives. Before the autumn harvest, all accounts must be preliminarily cleared and settled.

The instructions required all localities to conduct a general inspection of the implementation of policies in agricultural cooperatives, to firmly establish the advantage of poor peasants in the leadership of agricultural cooperatives, and at the same time, to absorb active elements from among the well-to-do middle peasants to participate in the leadership. When contributing share funds and pricing the means of production, it is necessary to seriously conduct democratic consultation, especially paying attention to the opinions of middle peasants. The instructions also required agricultural cooperatives to strengthen regular ideological education work for members, and at the same time, to take care of and concern themselves with the individual interests of members on the principle of not hindering collective interests, so that individual interests and collective interests are correctly combined.

    中共山西省委提出解决农村工作中主要问题的办法
    保证增加农业合作社社员的实际收入
    本报讯　中共山西省委员会日前发出“关于当前农村工作中几个主要问题的指示（草案）”，要求山西各地党委深入发现和及时解决这些问题，保证农业生产合作社增加生产，保证增加农业社社员的实际收入。
    指示指出：全省大部分农业合作社的生产计划偏高，各地必须迅速地、慎重地普遍审查和修订农业合作社的生产计划，把生产计划建立在既先进又切实可靠的基础上。根据修订后的生产计划，再进行财务规划。财务规划中首先要保证社员实际收入比1955年平均增加10％到20％。
    指示规定了进行农业基本建设的方针：着重生产性的，尽量压缩非生产性的；在生产性的基本建设当中，又应当着重当年得利的。指示还规定每个农业合作社用于基本建设的劳动日，应当只占全社全年农副业劳动日总数的15％，最多不超过20％，非生产性基本建设所用的劳动日，最多只应占基本建设所用劳动日总数的十分之一。
    针对部分农业合作社组织机构庞大和铺张浪费等情况，指示中规定了农业合作社记劳动日的原则、脱离生产的干部的人数和报酬总数，并且规定农业社的行政管理费用不得超过全社总收入的0.5％。
    指示还规定：农业生产合作社必须积极发展集体经营的副业生产，同时要帮助和组织社员从事宜于分散进行的副业生产。首先，农业社的生产计划必须包括副业生产计划；其次，农业社应当允许社员在一年之内有两个月的时间从事个人副业生产及其他活动；第三、社员个人从事副业生产所得的收入，全部归个人所有，不必归社，社里也不给他记劳动日。
    根据许多农业社牲口瘦弱而且有不少死亡的情况，指示要求各级党委迅速解决饲草饲料问题，并且对农业社的牲口饲养管理工作进行一次普遍的检查和整顿。为了避免分配时的困难，指示要求各地结合春耕播种，进一步整顿农业合作社的劳动管理，使全部农业社都能实行定额管理和做好劳力规划。指示还指出：整顿农业社的财务管理，是执行勤俭办社方针的重要一环。各地应当充分发挥会计辅导员和会计互助网的作用，迅速地整顿农业社的财务。在秋收以前，必须把全部账目进行初步的清理和结算。
    指示要求各地对农业社执行政策的情况普遍进行一次检查，在农业社的领导成分中确实树立贫农的优势，同时吸收富裕中农中间的积极分子参加领导。在摊纳股份基金和生产资料作价的时候，必须认真经过民主协商，特别要重视中农的意见。指示还要求农业社加强对社员的经常的思想教育工作，同时，在不妨碍集体利益的原则下，要照顾和关心社员个人的利益，使个人利益和集体利益正确地结合起来。
