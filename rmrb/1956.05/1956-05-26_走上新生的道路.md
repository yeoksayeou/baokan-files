　　Embarking on the Road to a New Life
　　Xiao Huang, Yao Ziqiang

　　In Xiamen City, the frontline of coastal defense in Fujian, Lin Rongfu, a former Kuomintang secret agent who confessed his crimes and repented, the "Xiamen Station Leader" of the Chiang Kai-shek's secret service agency "National Security Bureau Intelligence Bureau," was treated with leniency on the 23rd. On that day, when the Xiamen Municipal People's Procuratorate announced its decision to exempt Lin Rongfu from prosecution, this veteran agent of the Chiang Kai-shek clique could not help but exclaim with emotion: "I truly did not expect the government to be so lenient towards me, giving me the opportunity to be a new person."

　　Lin Rongfu was a "Central Statistics Bureau" agent before liberation and had engaged in the heinous activity of arresting communists. After liberation, he fled to Hong Kong and received training and assignment from the Chiang Kai-shek secret service agency "National Security Bureau Intelligence Bureau." In late October of last year, he accepted the task of gathering intelligence from the secret service and sneaked back to the mainland.

　　Lin Rongfu returned to Xiamen and lived in his own home. As soon as he returned home, he felt that his home had changed: his youngest daughter, who was born after he went to Hong Kong, was already five years old, and his eldest son, who was seven years old, was attending kindergarten; his two nieces who lived with him were already in middle school and were both members of the Communist Youth League. Before Lin Rongfu had a chance to ask his nieces about the situation at school, his eldest niece, Li Meiyue, asked him first: "Uncle, why did you only come home today?" Lin Rongfu answered evasively, telling her that he had lost his job in Hong Kong; he also talked a lot about how hard life was in Hong Kong and how he was exploited and oppressed by the capitalists. However, Li Meiyue saw the two brand-new watches, Parker pen, and a pile of "gifts" he brought back, which did not resemble a person who had returned after losing his job. Recalling his past behavior, she had a good idea in her mind and stopped asking questions.

　　Two days later, Lin Rongfu's wife, Wu Baoqian, came home. She worked as a nanny in an organization. In the past, she knew nothing except housework. Now, as soon as she met him, she enthusiastically told him about the achievements of the motherland's construction and the improvement of people's lives in recent years. These changes in his wife led to changes in Lin Rongfu's thinking.

　　Later, every time Li Meiyue came home from school, she introduced to Lin Rongfu the various construction projects and government policies since the founding of New China. She talked in detail about how many hidden counter-revolutionaries had been exposed in the current movement to eliminate counter-revolutionaries, and how some secret agents had voluntarily confessed their crimes and thus received lenient treatment. Li Meiyue often borrowed some anti-espionage novels from school for Lin Rongfu to read. Lin Rongfu was flustered after reading these books: he suspected that his niece had discovered that he was a secret agent. Should he confess and strive for leniency, or refuse to confess and be suppressed?

　　During the holidays, Li Meiyue accompanied him to the suburbs and Zhongshan Park to play, and while playing, she introduced to him the changes and future prospects of the motherland and his hometown in recent years. Lin Rongfu personally witnessed many new construction projects that he had never dared to imagine in the past, and saw that everything was in order and people were full of vitality. What he found most incomprehensible was that one day he personally witnessed those capitalists beating gongs and drums to apply for joint public-private ownership, voluntarily accepting socialist transformation. He realized that the Chiang Kai-shek clique's secret agents in Hong Kong were telling him lies when they said that "there is a famine on the mainland, and the people are looking forward to a 'counter-offensive.'" He felt that in this society, everyone was cheerful and held their heads high, only he was doing things secretly, harboring ghosts, and always felt frightened and did not dare to look others in the eye when walking on the road.

　　One day, Li Meiyue accompanied him to see the movie "Heaven and Earth Net." After watching the movie, Li Meiyue asked him if the film was good, and he vaguely replied: "The artistic quality of this film is not very high." While saying this, he felt chills running down his spine: in the movie, there was an uncle and a niece, and we are also an uncle and a niece. If I also encounter a situation like Agent No. 7, would I also harm my niece?

　　Since returning home, Lin Rongfu always deliberately placed the letters he wrote to others in conspicuous places to show that he was very "innocent." But once he used the pseudonym "Wu Shifen" to send intelligence to the Hong Kong secret service agency in code, he no longer did it so "openly." These situations attracted the attention of his family, especially Li Meiyue and her sister Li Meiling. In this way, Lin Rongfu increasingly felt that these two nieces were a bit like the "Young Pioneers" in the movies, and he no longer had the possibility of sending a second intelligence report.

　　Not long after, the "Xiamen Daily" published a message: Sun Xizong, a secret agent who refused to confess, was sentenced to death, and Huang Rushu, another secret agent who confessed thoroughly and showed genuine remorse, was released leniently. At this time, reality forced him to consider his own fate: the two thoughts of "confession" and "concealment" waged a fierce struggle in his mind. Walking on the street, he felt as if everyone around him had seen him as a secret agent, and he often broke out in a cold sweat with worry. Sometimes the more he thought about it, the more uneasy he became. He could not eat or sleep well, and often dreamed of being arrested in the middle of the night, screaming in fright. These abnormal phenomena aroused the questions of his sister and nieces, but Lin Rongfu dared not speak clearly, so he had to stay at home all day and sleep during the day.

　　With the gradual deepening of the propaganda for the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, one day, at a forum in the neighborhood group, he heard that several more counter-revolutionaries who refused to confess had been arrested. He dared not interrupt and felt as if he was being pricked by needles, just lowering his head and saying nothing. That night, he tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep all night. Opening his eyes and closing his eyes, he could not get rid of the two conflicting thoughts: without confession, there would be no future; with confession, he would receive leniency from the government and the people. If he continued to hesitate, he would one day end up like Sun Xizong. Finally, Lin Rongfu finally made up his mind, confessed his crimes to the public security organs, and unloaded the heavy burden on his heart.

　　On the 23rd, at a meeting attended by nearly a thousand people, Lin Rongfu described to the people present how he finally chose the path of self-renewal. He said: "I am now on the right path, and I want to be a new person, repaying the government and the people for their leniency with practical actions. I hope that those counter-revolutionaries who have not yet confessed and repented will repent as soon as possible and make up their minds to embark on a new life like me!" (Xinhua News Agency)

    走上新生的道路
    萧璜　姚自强
    在福建海防前哨的厦门市，有一个坦白自新的潜伏特务、蒋介石特务机关“国家安全局情报局”“厦门站组长”林荣甫，在二十三日得到了宽大处理。这天，当厦门市人民检察院宣布决定对林荣甫免予起诉的时候，这个蒋介石集团的老牌特务不禁激动地说：“我真没有想到政府会对我这样宽大，使我有了重新做人的机会。”
    林荣甫在解放前就是“中统”特务，曾经干过搜捕共产党员的罪恶勾当。解放以后跑到香港，又接受了蒋介石特务机关“国家安全局情报局”的训练和委派。去年十月下旬，他接受了特务机关刺探情报的任务潜回大陆。
    林荣甫回到厦门住在自己的家里。他一回到家就感到家里变了样：他去香港后才出生的小女儿已经五岁了，七岁的大儿子上了幼儿园；和他住在一家的两个外甥女都已经上了中学，而且都是青年团员。林荣甫还没有来得及向外甥女们打听学校里的情况，不料大外甥女李美月却先问他：“舅舅，你为什么直到今天才回家？”林荣甫答非所问地告诉她说，他在香港失了业；还说了许多在香港生活怎么苦，怎么受资本家的剥削压迫。但是李美月看到他带回来的两只崭新的手表、派克笔和一大堆“礼物”，怎么说也不像一个失业归来的人，再联想起他过去的为人，心里就有了数，就不再追问下去了。
    过了两天，林荣甫的妻子吴宝纤回家来了。她在一个机关里当保姆。过去她除了家务事什么也不懂，现在，一见面就兴致勃勃地告诉他这几年来祖国建设的成就和人民生活改善的情况。这些使林荣甫在思想上有了变化。
    以后，李美月每次放学回家，就给林荣甫介绍新中国成立以来的各项建设和政府的各项政策。她特别详细地谈到在这次肃清反革命分子的运动中，有许多暗藏的反革命分子都被揭发出来了，也有一些特务分子主动交代出自己的罪行，因而得到了宽大处理。李美月还常常从学校里借回一些反特务的小说给林荣甫看。林荣甫看了这些书心里就着慌：怀疑外甥女是不是已经发觉他是个特务？自己不坦白受到镇压，还是坦白了争取宽大呢？
    假日里，李美月陪他到市郊和中山公园玩，一面玩，一面向他介绍祖国和家乡在这些年来的变化和未来的远景。林荣甫亲眼看到了许多过去连想也没有敢想的新的工程建设，看到了到处都很有秩序，人们都生气蓬勃，特别是在街头上看不到一个乞丐。使他感到最不可理解的是，有一天他亲眼看到了那些资本家们敲锣打鼓申请公私合营，主动接受社会主义改造。他发觉蒋介石集团特务们在香港对他说的“大陆上正在闹饥荒，老百姓盼望着‘反攻’”的那一套完全是骗人的鬼话。他觉得这个社会里，每一个人都是兴高采烈，昂头挺胸，只有自己干着偷偷摸摸的事，怀着鬼胎，走在路上总是心惊肉跳，不敢正眼看别人一眼。
    有一天，李美月陪他去看电影“天罗地网”。看完电影，李美月问他这部影片好不好，他含含糊糊地回答：“这部影片的艺术性不怎么高。”嘴里这么说，心里却在一阵一阵打冷战：电影里是舅舅外甥女，我们也是舅舅外甥女，要是自己也碰到像七号特务这样情况，会不会也对外甥女下毒手呢？
    林荣甫自从回家后，给别人写信总是写完了就故意放到露眼的地方，显示自己是很“清白”的。但有一次他以“吴适芬”的化名用暗语向香港特务机关送情报，就不再这样“公开”了。这些情况引起了家里人特别是李美月和她妹妹李美玲的注意，这样，林荣甫就越来越感到这两个外甥女有点像电影里的“红领巾”了，他再也没有可能发出第二份情报。
    过了不久，“厦门日报”上刊登了一条消息：有一个拒不坦白的特务分子孙锡宗被判处死刑，另一个坦白彻底、确有悔悟的特务分子黄如淑被宽大释放。这时候，现实迫使他考虑自己的命运：“坦白”和“隐瞒”两种思想在他脑子里展开了激烈的斗争。走在街上，他觉得好像周围的人都已看清他是个特务，常常担心得出一身冷汗。有时越想越不安，连饭也吃不下，觉也睡不好，常常半夜里梦见自己被逮捕了，吓得叫喊起来。这些反常的现象，引起了他姐姐和外甥女的追问，但林荣甫又不敢明讲，只好整天闷在家里，白天也睡大觉。
    随着镇压反革命宣传的逐步深入，有一天，他在居民小组的座谈会上，听到又有几个拒不坦白的反革命分子被逮捕了。他听了不敢插嘴，混身如同针刺，只是低头不语。这天夜里，他睡在床上翻来复去，通宵不能入眠，睁开眼，闭上眼，总无法摆脱起伏纠缠的两种思想：不坦白就没有前途，坦白就会得到政府和人民的宽大。如果再犹豫下去，就总有一天会得到孙锡宗一样的下场。最后，林荣甫终于下定决心，向公安机关坦白了自己的罪行，卸下了压在心头的千斤重担。
    二十三日，在有近千人参加的大会上，林荣甫向到会的人们叙述了自己怎样最后选择了自新的道路。他说：“我现在的路走对了，我要重新做人，以实际行动来报答政府和人民对我的宽大。我希望那些还没有自新坦白的反革命分子，及早悔悟，赶快下决心走上像我一样的新生的道路！”　（新华社）
