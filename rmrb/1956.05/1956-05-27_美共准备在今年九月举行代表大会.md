    The "Worker Daily" of New York reported on May 14 that the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) announced on the 13th that the CPUSA will convene a National Convention in September this year to determine its attitude towards the Republican and Democratic candidates and platforms in this year's election.
    The newspaper also reported that the National Committee meeting, which closed on May 1, adopted a report by Claude Lightfoot, chairman of the Illinois state party organization, on the 1956 election policy.
    In his report, Lightfoot pointed out that the main goal of workers and progressive forces in this year's election is to "defeat the millionaire cabinet." He said that in order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to "defeat the Southern Democrats within the Democratic Party, to adopt a new attitude towards the struggle for peace, and for the liberal faction of the Democratic Party to adopt a courageous and fighting attitude." He also said: "Because the Democrats are tending towards a more clear and straightforward attitude on some issues, they will force the Republicans to discuss these issues in a different way, which will make the issues more obvious, and whoever wins must take them into account. Defeating the Republican millionaire cabinet and defeating the more reactionary elements within the Democratic Party will lay the foundation for the people to win greater concessions."
    Lightfoot pointed out that the 1956 election will revolve around several issues that have "reached a critical juncture," including: the rising struggle of Black people against racial discrimination, the agricultural crisis occurring in some areas, a series of economic issues closely related to labor, and the people's demand to change U.S. foreign policy, end the Cold War, and formulate a policy of competitive coexistence.
    Simon Gerson, head of the Party Committee for the Study of Civil Rights, spoke at the National Committee meeting about the general demand of the American people to re-examine many repressive legislations of the past. He said: "Although the struggle to restore the Bill of Rights continues to fluctuate, the main trend is upward."
    The National Committee meeting passed a resolution paying tribute to the Smith Act victims who are still detained in federal prisons. These victims include Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Henry Winston, Gilbert Green, Gus Hall, Pettis Perry, Robert Thompson, and others.

    美共准备在今年九月举行代表大会
    本报讯　据五月十四日纽约“工人日报”报道：美国共产党全国委员会在十三日宣布，美国共产党将在今年九月间召开全国代表大会，以确定今年大选时对共和党与民主党的候选人和政纲的态度。
    报纸还报道说：五月一日闭幕的全国委员会会议通过了伊利诺斯州党组织的主席克·莱弗特关于1956年大选政策的报告。
    莱弗特在报告中指出：工人和进步力量对今年大选的主要目标是“击败富豪内阁”。他说，要想达到这个目标，必须“击败民主党内的南部民主党人，需要对争取和平的斗争采取新的态度，并且需要民主党的自由主义派采取一种勇敢的战斗态度。”他还说：“由于民主党人在一些问题上趋于一种比较明确和直率的态度，因而将迫使共和党以一种不同的方式讨论这些问题，结果将使问题变得更加明显，并且不管谁获得胜利，都必须加以考虑。击败共和党的富豪内阁和击败民主党内比较反动的分子，将为人民赢得更大的让步打下基础。”
    莱弗特指出，1956年的大选将围绕着几个“已经达到紧急关头”的问题，这些问题是：日益高涨的黑人反对种族歧视的斗争，在一些地区发生的农业危机，一系列同劳工有很大关系的经济问题和人民要求改变美国外交政策、结束冷战并制定竞争性共处的政策。
    研究公民权利问题的党委会的负责人西蒙·吉尔逊在全国委员会会议上发言，谈到美国人民普遍要求重新审查过去许多镇压性的立法。他说：“虽然争取恢复权利法案的斗争继续起伏不定，但主要的趋势是上升的。”
    全国委员会会议通过了一项决议，向现在还被拘禁在联邦监狱里的史密斯法受害者致敬。这些受害者包括伊·葛·弗林、亨利·温斯顿、吉伯特·格林、葛·霍尔、佩蒂斯·佩里、罗伯特·汤普逊等。
