Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 13th - Czechoslovakia will build its first atomic power station entirely with equipment manufactured in Czechoslovakia. Construction of this power station will begin in Slovakia in 1957, and it is scheduled to begin generating electricity in 1960.
    This was stated by Czechoslovak Minister of Power Industry, Vlasak, when talking to the press about the development of the Czechoslovak power industry. He pointed out that the new power generation equipment put into production during the second Five-Year Plan, which begins this year, will reach 2.3 million kilowatts, which is equal to the total power generation capacity built up in Czechoslovakia before liberation. Calculated per capita, Czechoslovakia's electricity production already exceeded France in 1953, and by 1960 it will catch up with Britain and West Germany.

    捷将以自制设备建成第一座原子能发电站
    新华社布拉格13日电　捷克斯洛伐克将完全以自己制造的设备建成捷克斯洛伐克的第一座原子能发电站。这个电力站将在1957年在斯洛伐克开始建造，预定在1960年开始发电。
    这是捷克斯洛伐克动力工业部长弗拉沙克对报界谈捷动力工业发展时说的。他指出，在今年开始的第二个五年计划期间投入生产的新建发电设备，将达二百三十万瓩，这等于捷克斯洛伐克解放前所建设起来的发电能力的总和。按人口平均计算，捷克斯洛伐克的电力生产在1953年就已经超过了法国，到1960年，它将赶上英国和西德。
