Xinhua News Agency report:

    The deeds of unity and mutual assistance between Miao and Han students at Kaili Elementary School in Lushan Miao Autonomous County, Guizhou Province, are constantly being recorded in the students' record books of new morality development.
    After the start of the school year this year, He Zhongqi, a Han student in the fifth grade, was lagging behind in his studies. Yang Zailin, a Miao student with good grades, noticed this and took the initiative to ask the teacher to change seats so he could be closer to He Zhongqi and help him with his studies at any time. Wu Dezhi, a Miao student, couldn't go home for lunch because of foot pain, so Han students fetched his lunch for him and took him home in the evening. The students also actively helped others outside of school.
    The number of students at Kaili Elementary School has now increased to more than 700, nearly six times more than before liberation.

    小学生的新品德
    贵州省炉山苗族自治县凯里小学苗族和汉族学生团结互助的事迹，不断被记录在学生新品德成长的记录本上。
    在今年学业开始后，五年级学生中有一个汉族学生何仲畦学习成绩较差，成绩较好的苗族学生杨再林发现后，就主动向教师要求调换坐位，和何仲畦靠近，随时帮助他学习功课。苗族学生吴德智因脚痛，不能回家吃午饭，汉族学生就替他到家取饭，到晚上又送他回家。学生们在校外也积极帮助别人。
    凯里小学学生现在已增加到七百多人，比解放前增加近六倍。
