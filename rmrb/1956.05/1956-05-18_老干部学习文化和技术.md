    Veteran Cadres Study Culture and Technology

    At six o'clock in the morning on May 14th, groups of veteran cadres from the First Automobile Works hurried into a building to study culture and technology. They have persisted in studying for more than two years. Some of them only studied in private schools for two years in the past, and some only attended elementary school, but now they are sitting in classrooms, patiently studying the courses of secondary technical schools. Some have learned mechanical drawing, some know the principles of electrical engineering, and some can already understand blueprints.

    Currently, there are 380 cadres in the factory studying in the leadership cadre training class. Among them, more than 90 cadres are excellent students who score 5 or 4 in every subject. (Huang Jiemin) (Attached picture)

    老干部学习文化和技术
    五月十四日早晨六点钟，第一汽车制造厂一群群的老干部匆匆忙忙走进一座大楼，去学习文化和技术。他们坚持学习，已经两年多了。有的人过去只念过两年私塾，有的人只读过初小，现在他们却坐在教室里，耐心地学习着中等技术学校的课程。有的人学会了机械的制图，有的人知道了电工原理，有的人已经能够看懂图纸。
    现在全厂已经有三百八十名干部在领导干部训练班里学习。其中九十多名干部，是每门功课都是五分或四分的优秀学员。（黄洁民）（附图片）
