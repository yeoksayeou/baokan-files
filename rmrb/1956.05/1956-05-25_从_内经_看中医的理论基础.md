    On the Theoretical Basis of Traditional Chinese Medicine from "The Inner Canon"
    Ren Jiyu
    "The Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon" is a comprehensive medical book compiled in the early Han Dynasty. It is the earliest systematic medical masterpiece in the world, summarizing medical experiences since the Zhou and Qin Dynasties. All Chinese medical works, starting from "Treatise on Cold Damage," have been gradually enriched and improved on the basis of "The Inner Canon," so successive generations of Chinese medicine scholars have called it "the ancestor of medical books."
    For thousands of years, "The Inner Canon" has been recognized as "the ancestor of medical books," not only because of its earliest era, but also because it provides a set of theories and medical principles of Chinese medicine.
  The immortal status of "The Inner Canon" in the history of Chinese medicine is just like the immortal status of "The Art of War" in the history of Chinese military thought.
    "The Inner Canon" is full of concepts such as "yin and yang," "five elements," "essence," and "qi." For people who have received modern medical education, it is difficult to accept, thinking that the principles of traditional Chinese medicine are somewhat mysterious, and feel that "Chinese medicine talks about yin and yang and five elements, which is not scientific." To explain this issue, it is necessary to look back at the development of ancient Chinese philosophy.
      Like the history of world philosophy, the history of ancient Chinese philosophy also developed in the struggle between two different philosophical lines. One is the idealist line; the other is the materialist line. Many materialist philosophical schools believe that the universe is filled with extremely subtle material entities composed of "qi." "Qi" has fluidity, particle properties, and is divided into clear and turbid. Clear and light qi is the material that makes up the sky, belonging to yang; turbid and heavy qi is the material that makes up the earth, belonging to yin. Yin and yang qi constitute all things and human beings. This view formed the mainstream of materialist philosophy in the late Warring States period (4th and 3rd centuries BC). Like the Twelve Chronicles of the Lüshi Chunqiu, the Monthly Orders of the Book of Rites, several chapters in Guanzi, and the later Huainanzi in the early Han Dynasty, all contain this kind of thought. For example, the Lüshi Chunqiu says:
      "Taiyi produces two instruments, two instruments produce yin and yang, yin and yang change, one up and one down, combined to form a chapter. Hunhun Dun Dun. Separation then reunification, reunification then separation, this is called the law of heaven." The so-called "Taiyi" here is the original state of undivided, chaotic qi, and the two instruments of yin and yang are divided, with contradictory and opposing properties of qi.
    The concept of the five elements is summarized based on the five material forms that people most often come into contact with in their daily life practice. They believe that everything in the world is composed of five elements - water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. Simple things are composed of one element, and complex things are composed of five elements in extremely complex situations. This school also believes that there is a mutually promoting and breeding relationship between the five elements, which they call "five elements generating each other"; there is also a mutually overcoming and restraining relationship between the five elements, which is called "five elements overcoming each other."
    The yin and yang and five elements theory lies in breaking away from the shackles of the concept of God controlling the world, striving to seek the origin of the occurrence, development and extinction of all things in the material world itself, and carrying out struggle against religious superstition from experience, from life practice, and from the scientific achievements at that time. Therefore, the yin and yang and five elements theory gradually developed into a relatively complete materialist philosophical system in the late Warring States period. This is what the ancient books call the "Yinyang school." The ancient Yinyang schools all included the five elements theory. Mr. Guo Moruo once pointed out:
      [The Yinyang and five elements school] In its initial occurrence, we should say that it is anti-superstition and closer to science. In the era when theocratic thought was shaken, scholars were not satisfied with the outdated concept that all things were created by God, so atheism appeared. New concepts such as Taiyi yin and yang were produced. The new concept was still considered to be too general, so it had to be analyzed in more detail and more concretized, so there was the primitive atomic theory of gold, wood, water, fire, and earth of the five elements. The composition of all things is sought from these essential five major elements, this idea should be regarded as a major progress" (Ten Criticisms, p. 405). The author basically agrees with Mr. Guo Moruo's view that the emergence of the yin and yang and five elements school marks a further development of Chinese materialist philosophy.
    The yin and yang and five elements theory is essentially materialistic, but it should be pointed out that idealists also used this theory to explain society, history, and people's good and bad fortune, and promoted fatalism and mysticism. This school should be distinguished from the yin and yang and five elements school mentioned above.
    The theoretical basis of "The Inner Canon" is closely related to the ancient yin and yang and five elements school. "The Inner Canon" first points out according to the then primitive materialist worldview:
      "The five movements of yin and yang are the way of heaven and earth, the framework of all things, the parents of change, the origin of life and death, and the mansion of gods" (Author's note: that is, the dwelling place of the spirit) ("The Inner Canon": Tianyuan Ji Da Lun).
    "The Inner Canon" here correctly points out that human physical activity, mental function, and life phenomena are part of the entire natural world. It recognizes physiological and disease phenomena from the premise of the unity of natural laws, a materialist worldview. Under the control of the five elements concept, "The Inner Canon" matches human five viscera, five sense organs, five emotions, and five flavors with the five elements, such as wood representing the liver, fire representing the heart, earth representing the stomach, water representing the kidney, and metal representing the lungs. "The Inner Canon" also points out, based on medical experience, that there is a mutually restricting and mutually assisting relationship between the five viscera. Metal can overcome wood, meaning that if the lungs are sick, it will affect the normal functioning of the liver and blood. "The Inner Canon" also uses the concept of "five elements" to regard human body organs and their functions as a unified whole. Therefore, the so-called "stomach" in traditional Chinese medicine is not only limited to the stomach that contains food, it also refers to the human digestive system, and also refers to the digestive function of the human body. In this way, it is more convenient to use the broader and symbolic meaning of "earth" to represent the organs and functions of the stomach. Ancient Chinese medicine's view of other internal organs is also the same.
    Therefore, traditional Chinese medicine uses yin and yang and five elements qi to explain pathology and physiology, which seems very "mysterious," but in fact it is definitely pointed out. We say that this basic viewpoint (especially the connection between institutions and functions, the constraints between institutions) is desirable and has a rational core.
    Ancient Chinese medicine, according to the scientific practice at that time, and according to the primitive materialist philosophical viewpoint at that time, pointed out that man is a part of nature, so it is necessary to understand pathological and physiological phenomena according to natural laws: "The five viscera and twelve joints all communicate with the weather." According to the principle of the unity of natural laws, "The Inner Canon" believes that following the laws of nature will not cause illness, and violating them will cause illness and even death. "The Inner Canon" says:
          "Yin and yang and the four seasons are the beginning and end of all things, and the foundation of life and death. Reversing them will cause disasters, and following them will prevent illnesses from occurring" ("The Inner Canon": Siqi Tiao Shen Da Lun). If you violate the changes of the four seasons, you will get sick:
          "Those who frequently violate this (Author's note: this refers to the four seasons, yin and yang) will have evil qi injure people. This is the foundation of life...Following it will strengthen the yang qi, and even if there is evil, it will not be able to harm you" ("The Inner Canon": Sheng Qi Tong Tian Lun).
    Ancient Chinese medicine has realized that there is an extremely subtle substance in nature that is not conducive to the human body, which they call "evil qi," sometimes also called "unrighteous qi of the four seasons." This evil qi invades the human body and makes people sick. The ancients did not know that there were bacteria, but based on long-term and rich experience, traditional Chinese medicine speculated that what harms the body is not the work of ghosts and gods but some material "evil qi." This view was a scientific hypothesis at that time. Traditional Chinese medicine also pointed out that as long as the body is healthy and the resistance is strong ("yang qi is solid"), it can avoid the invasion of evil qi. Because traditional Chinese medicine correctly grasped this point of view, it often adopts measures to enhance the patient's physique in terms of medical viewpoints and health care theories, so that the patient's "yang qi is solid" to resist diseases. Many drugs in Chinese medicine do not have a therapeutic effect (especially some "yin nourishing" and "wei nourishing" drugs are particularly numerous.) but have the effect of preventing diseases, which is a feature in world medicine. This therapeutic point of view of resisting diseases by enhancing physical fitness is inseparable from its view of nature.
    Ancient Chinese medicine recognizes pathological phenomena from the principle of materialism, so the principle of materialism is also implemented in the treatment theory:
      "At the beginning of the disease, it can be pricked (Author's note: the disease is mild and can be treated with acupuncture); when it is at its peak, it can be waited for it to weaken (Author's note: the theoretical basis of TCM treatment of Japanese encephalitis and typhoid fever lies here); therefore, when it is mild, promote it; when it is heavy, reduce it; when it is weak, highlight it. If the form is insufficient, warm it with qi; if the essence is insufficient, supplement it with taste; if it is high, then cross it; if it is low, then draw it out and exhaust it; if it is full in the middle, then write (drain) it internally; if there is evil, then soak the form to make sweat; if it is in the skin, then sweat and release it; if it is brave and fierce, then press and collect it; if it is real, then disperse and write (drain) it. Examine its yin and yang to distinguish between soft and rigid; treat yin diseases with yang, and treat yang diseases with yin. Determine its blood qi, and each guard its hometown. If the blood is solid, it should be drained; if the qi is weak, it should be directed?" ("The Inner Canon": Yin Yang Ying Xiang Da Lun).
    We do not need to explain these treatment processes here, but we should recognize that these treatment processes run through an extremely valuable principle, that is, different treatment plans are proposed according to different conditions and the differences in the individual constitution and strength of the patient. Therefore, some need to be drained, some need to be supplemented, some need to sweat, some need to rest... The good results achieved by TCM in treatment are inseparable from its materialistic view of pathological analysis.
    Of course, we must also point out that the theory of TCM also has the weaknesses of intuitiveness and speculation. Some principles, it said correctly by genius, but it cannot make a complete explanation of many complex problems that conforms to scientific principles. There is science in the theory of TCM, and it is also mixed with speculation. The above-mentioned hypothesis that "evil qi" or "unrighteous qi of the four seasons" can harm people did indeed forcefully attack the fallacy that ghosts and gods are responsible for human illness, and correctly pointed out that the occurrence of disease has its material roots. However, being satisfied with the hypothesis of "evil qi" harming people without further research on the origin of the disease will make it impossible to accept the latest achievements of modern science and hinder the continued development of TCM.
    Ancient Chinese medicine is based on the materialist philosophy of yin and yang and five elements as its theoretical basis. On the one hand, it has primitive materialist elements, and on the other hand, it also has dialectical thinking. Ancient Chinese medicine believes that nature and every specific thing in nature has its two opposing aspects of yin and yang. Things exist in the contradiction of yin and yang opposition. TCM believes that if the two forces of yin and yang qi can maintain a normal state of opposition and balance in the human body, people will be healthy; if they cannot maintain a normal state of opposition and balance, people will get sick. So it is said:
      "Yin is peaceful and yang is secret, and the spirit is governed; yin and yang are separated, and the essence and qi are exhausted" ("The Inner Canon": Sheng Qi Tong Tian Lun). It also says:
      "If yin cannot overcome its yang, then the pulse flows thinly [forced] and rapidly [urgent], and it is crazy; if yang cannot overcome its yin, then the qi of the five viscera will fight, and the nine orifices will not be clear" ("The Inner Canon": Sheng Qi Tong Tian Lun).
    Based on the principle of yin and yang qi opposition and balance, starting from "The Inner Canon," the foundation was laid for dividing diseases into six types: Taiyang, Yangming, Shaoyang, Taiyin, Shaoyin, and Jueyin.
  "Treatise on Cold Damage" is basically continued to be developed and enriched according to this point of view. Mr. Yan Derun once gave a scientific explanation of the TCM classification of three yin and three yang:
      "Generally, those that are hot are yang, and those that are cold are yin; those that are real are yang, and those that are empty are yin. If interpreted in Western medical terms, those diseases that are progressive are yang, and those that are regressive are yin; those with hyperfunction are yang, and those with hypofunction are yin" ("Treatise on Cold Damage", People's Medical Publishing House, p. 7).
    Of course, due to the limitations of scientific development at that time, ancient medical scientists could not achieve a precise and accurate degree of understanding of the structure of human internal organs and limbs. Therefore, some explanations of pathological phenomena are not satisfactory.
    Ancient Chinese medicine also correctly pointed out that the organs and parts of human physiology are interconnected and interconnected as a whole. The five elements are inseparable, and there is a relationship of mutual generation and mutual restraint. The five viscera are also a whole, and have the function of mutual generation and mutual restraint. If the activity of a certain part of the institution is abnormal, it will inevitably affect other related institutions. For example, TCM believes that if there is an imbalance of yin and yang in the liver, it will affect the vision of the eyes, it will affect the abnormal digestion, and it will also affect the emotional agitation, and so on. The same is true for other departments and organs. Therefore, "treating the head when it hurts, and treating the feet when they hurt" has become a wonderful satire on the metaphysical viewpoint in Chinese medical theory. Unfortunately, there are still some medical scientists today who also have such metaphysical viewpoints. They are not only lagging behind today's advanced medicine, but even have not properly absorbed the valuable parts of medicine more than two thousand years ago.
    Ancient Chinese medicine, more than two thousand years ago, had already pointed out that physiological phenomena and psychological phenomena are interrelated. "The Inner Canon" once said that the activity of the liver is related to the emotion of anger ("anger hurts the liver"); the activity of the heart is related to the emotion of joy ("joy hurts the heart"); the activity of the spleen is related to the function of thinking ("thinking hurts the spleen"); the activity of the lungs is related to the emotion of melancholy ("melancholy hurts the lungs"); the activity of the kidneys is related to the emotion of fear ("fear hurts the kidneys") (see "The Inner Canon": Yin Yang Ying Xiang Da Lun and other chapters).
    Modern science has proven that human psychological activity is due to the excitation and inhibition of the cerebral cortex caused by external stimuli to human analytical organs. Psychological activity has an internal connection with the respiratory, digestive, and circulatory systems. Due to scientific limitations, ancient Chinese medicine was not able to fully and correctly explain this relationship.
    Ancient Chinese medicine often proceeds from the overall point of view, so it opposes the ideological method of recognizing problems in isolation, so it also looks at the relationship between disease and health in connection. Therefore, Chinese medicine often puts health care first, and puts drug treatment in a secondary position. Chinese medicine advocates:
    "Movement to avoid cold, yin dwelling to avoid heat, no fatigue inside, no excessive expansion outside, this is a world of tranquility and indifference, and evil cannot penetrate deeply" ("The Inner Canon": Yi Jing Bian Qi Lun). If you do not pay attention to daily hygiene, it will lead to dangerous consequences:
    "Worries and troubles are within, suffering the form is outside, and also losing the following of the four seasons, the suitability of cold and heat...small diseases must be severe, and major diseases must die" ("The Inner Canon": Yi Jing Bian Qi Lun). Proceeding from the overall concept of maintaining health, TCM has established the health care concept of prevention first:
      "Therefore, the sage does not treat diseases that have already occurred but treats diseases that have not yet occurred...Is it not too late to medicate after the disease has become, and to govern after the chaos has become, like digging a well when thirsty, and casting a cone when fighting?" ("The Inner Canon": Siqi Tiao Shen Da Lun) Even if treatment is unavoidable, Chinese medicine advocates treatment in the early stages:
      "Good healers treat the skin and hair (Author's note: treat when the disease has not penetrated deeply), then treat the muscles, then treat the tendons, then treat the six fu organs, then treat the five viscera. Treating the five viscera is half-dead and half-alive" ("The Inner Canon": Yin Yang Ying Xiang Da Lun).
    Overall, ancient China quite profoundly reflected the ideas of dialectics from scientific practice. It specifically applied this correct point of view in medical treatment, nutrition, hygiene, health care, physiology, psychology, and pathology. This way of thinking and point of view is extremely valuable and deserves full attention.
    However, we must also admit that ancient Chinese dialectics could not develop to a very perfect level. The TCM way of thinking represented by "The Inner Canon" also has the common weaknesses of ancient dialectics. Natural phenomena, life phenomena, and pathological phenomena are complex, and the scientific theory more than two thousand years ago could not possibly perfectly and deeply understand these laws, so "The Inner Canon" inevitably contains many unscientific and mystical components. Some problems, the scientific level at that time could not make a correct explanation, and when forced to explain, it would inevitably fall into the error of far-fetched association. These shortcomings are undeniable. Engels' teachings are worth remembering:
      "The only way that natural philosophy can use to perform this task is to replace the real connection of phenomena that it does not yet know with an ideal, illusory connection, to replace the lack of facts with fiction, and to fill the real defects in imagination alone. In doing so, natural philosophy reveals a lot of genius ideas and guesses at a lot of later discoveries, but there have also been a lot of nonsense and gibberish" ("Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy").
    "The Inner Canon," the first classic work of ancient Chinese medicine, contributed not only to providing treatment methods, but also to establishing a medical theory with primitive materialism and spontaneous dialectical viewpoints. This theory ensured that ancient Chinese medicine was completely separated from the idealistic witchcraft and superstition from the perspective of world outlook. At the same time, some weaknesses and shortcomings of the theory of Chinese medicine are also hidden here. Because ancient materialism and ancient dialectical thinking are not enough to fully explain the natural world, there is also a lack of a process of natural science development in the middle. Its materialism is still very rough, and it cannot distinguish the essential differences between physiology, life, and other phenomena in the natural world. Its dialectical thinking is also mixed with the weaknesses of being general and confused. This hinders its further development.
    Today, those who study TCM should of course strive to learn the medical technology of TCM and study the theory of TCM; but when mastering the medical technology of TCM and studying the rational core of TCM theory, they should also strive to learn natural science and dialectical materialism to remedy the weaknesses of Chinese medicine in the old era of long-term stagnation. Only in this way can we lay the foundation for further sorting out and transforming it with modern advanced medical theories.

    从“内经”看中医的理论基础
    任继愈
    “黄帝内经”是汉初编纂的一部医学全书，是世界上最早的成系统的医学巨作，它总结了周秦以来的医疗经验。所有的中国医学著作，从“伤寒论”起，都是在“内经”已有的基础上逐渐丰富完善起来的，所以历代的中医学者称它为“医书之祖”。
    几千年来公认“内经”为“医书之祖”倒不仅是由于它的时代最早，而是由于它提供了一套中国医学的理论和医疗原则。
  “内经”在中国医学史上的不朽的地位，恰如“孙子兵法”在中国军事思想史上的不朽的地位一样。
    “内经”一书中充满了一些“阴阳”、“五行”、“精”、“气”的观念。在受过现代医学教育的人们看来，是很难接受的，认为中医所讲的道理有些玄虚，觉得“中国医学讲阴阳五行，不科学”。为了说明这一问题，有回溯一下中国古代哲学史发展的必要。
      中国古代哲学史和世界哲学史一样，也是在两条不同的哲学路线斗争中发展起来的。一条是唯心主义的路线；一条是唯物主义的路线。许多唯物主义哲学流派认为充满了宇宙的是极精微的物质实体“气”所构成的。“气”具有流动性、粒子性、有清、浊之分。清的和轻的气是构成天空的材料，属于阳；浊的和重的气是构成大地的材料，属于阴。阴阳二气构成了万物和人类。这种观点在战国末期（公元前四、三世纪）形成了唯物主义哲学的主流。像吕氏春秋的十二纪、礼记的月令、管子中的若干篇，以及后来的汉初的淮南子，都包涵着这种思想。例如吕氏春秋所说的：
      “太一出两仪，两仪出阴阳，阴阳变化，一上一下，合而成章。浑浑沌沌。离则复合，合则复离，是谓天常。”这里所谓“太一”，就是原始状态的、混沌未分的气，两仪阴阳是已分的，具有矛盾对立性质的气。
    五行的观念，是根据人们日常生活实践中所最常接触的五种物质形态归纳出来的。他们认为世界上一切东西都是由五种元素——水、火、木、金、土构成的。成分简单的东西由一种元素构成，成分复杂的东西由五种元素在极复杂的情况下构成。这一派还认为五种元素之间有互相推动、孳生的关系，他们叫做“五行相生”；五种元素之间也还具有互相克服、限制的关系，这种关系叫做“五行相胜”。
    阴阳五行的学说在于摆脱上帝支配世界的观念的束缚，力图在物质世界本身中寻求万物发生发展以及消灭的根源，从经验、从生活实践、从当时的科学成就的基础上向宗教迷信进行斗争。因此，阴阳五行学说在战国末期逐渐发展成为一套比较完整的唯物主义的哲学体系。这就是古书上所说的“阴阳家”。古代的阴阳家都是包括了五行学说的。郭沫若先生曾指出：
      〔阴阳五行的学派〕在它初发生的时候，我们倒应当说它是反迷信的，更近于科学的。在神权思想动摇了的时代，学者不满足于万物为神所造的那种陈腐的观念，故尔有无神论出现。有太一阴阳等新的观念产生。对这种新的观念犹嫌其笼统，还要更分析入微，还要更具体化一点，于是便有这原始原子说的金、木、水、火、土的五行出现。万物的构成求之于这些实质的五个大原素，这思想应该算是一大进步”（十批判书，405页）。作者基本上同意郭沫若先生的看法，阴阳五行学派的出现，标志着中国唯物主义哲学得到进一步的发展。
    阴阳五行学说本质上是唯物的，但是应该指出，唯心主义者也利用了这种学说，他们把阴阳对立、五行相生相克的观点解释社会、历史和人们的吉凶祸福，宣传了宿命论和神秘主义。这一派和上面所说的阴阳五行学派应加以区别。
    “内经”的理论基础是和古代阴阳五行学派密切关联的。“内经”首先根据当时素朴的唯物主义的世界观，指出：
      “夫五运阴阳者，天地之道也，万物之纲纪、变化之父母、生杀之本始、神明之府（作者按：即精神的寄居所）也”（“内经”：天元纪大论）。
    “内经”在这里正确地指出人类身体活动、精神作用、生命现象是整个自然界的一部分。它从自然规律的统一性这一唯物主义世界观的前提出发来认识生理和疾病现象。在五行观念的支配下，“内经”把人类的五脏、五官、五情，以及五味都和五行配合起来，比如木代表肝，火代表心，土代表胃，水代表肾，金代表肺。“内经”还根据医疗经验，指出五脏之间，有互相制约互相辅助的关系。金可以克木，意味着肺部有病，会影响到肝脏和血液的正常。“内经”也还利用“五行”的观念，把人类的身体器官和它的作用看成统一的整体。因此，中医所谓“胃”，其实不仅限于容纳食物的胃脏，它也指人们的消化系统，还指人身的消化作用。这样，采用了更广泛的、象征意义的“土”来代表胃的器官和功能就方便些。古代中医对其他内脏的看法也是如此。
    所以中医用阴阳五行之气来说明病理和生理，看来很“玄虚”，其实是确有所指的。我们说这种基本观点（特别是机构和功能联系，机构之间的制约）是可取的，是有着合理的内核的。
    中国古代医学根据当时科学实践，并根据当时素朴的唯物主义哲学观点，指出人是自然的一部分，所以要按照自然规律认识病理和生理现象：“五脏十二节皆通天气”。根据自然规律统一的原则，“内经”认为，顺着自然界的规律，就不会生病，违反了就会生病以至死亡。“内经”说：
          “阴阳四时者，万物之终始也，死生之本也。逆之则灾害生，从之则苛疾不起”（“内经”：四气调神大论）。如果违反四时的变化，就会生病：
          “数犯此（作者按：此即四时、阴阳）者，则邪气伤人。此寿命之本也。……顺之则阳气固，虽有贼邪，弗能害也”（“内经”：生气通天论）。
    中国古代医学已意识到自然界有一种不利于人类身体的极细微的物质，他们称作“邪气”，有时也叫“四时不正之气”。这种邪气侵入人的身体内部，就会使人生病。古人不知道有细菌，但中医根据长期丰富的经验，推测到某种危害身体的不是鬼神的作祟而是某种物质性的“邪气”，这一观点在当时是科学性的假设。中医还指出，只要身体健康，抵抗力强（“阳气固”），就可以避免邪气的侵害。由于中医正确地掌握了这一观点，因而在医疗观点、保健理论方面也经常采用增强病人的体质的措施，使病者“阳气固”，来抵抗疾病。中药中有许多药物并不是有治疗作用（像一些“滋阴”、“养卫”的药品特别多。）却有防病的作用，这在世界医学中是一特色。这种以增强体质来抵抗疾病的治疗观点，和它的自然观是分不开的。
    中国古代医学从唯物主义的原则认识病理现象，所以治疗理论方面也贯彻了唯物主义的原则：
      “病之始起也，可刺而已（作者按：病象轻微，可用针砭）；其盛，可待衰而已（作者按：中医治疗乙型脑炎和伤寒的理论根据即在此）；故因其轻而扬之；因其重而减之；因其衰而彰之。形不足者，温之以气；精不足者，补之以味；其高者，因而越之；其下者，引而竭之；中满者，写（泻）之于内；其有邪者，渍形以为汗；其在皮者，汗而发之；其慓悍者，按而收之；其实者，散而写（泻）之。审其阴阳，以别柔刚；阳病治阴，阴病治阳。定其血气，各守其乡。血实宜决之；气虚宜?引之”（“内经”：阴阳应象大论）。
    我们在这里没有必要解说这些治疗过程，但是我们应当认识这些治疗过程贯串着一个极有价值的原则，那就是根据不同的病情和病人的个别体质强弱的差异而提出不同的治疗方案。所以有的要泻，有的要补，有的要发汗，有的要休息……。中医在治疗效果获得很好的成绩，和它对病理分析所采取的唯物主义的观点是分不开的。
    当然，我们也必须指出，中医的理论也还具有直观性和推测性的弱点。有些原则，它天才地说对了，但它却不能对许多复杂的问题做出完全符合科学原则的说明。中医的理论中间有科学，也夹杂着推测。像以上所举的“邪气”或“四时不正之气”可以伤人的假说，确曾有力地打击了鬼神作祟而使人生病的谬说，并且正确地指出疾病的发生有它的物质根源。但满足于“邪气”伤人的假说，而不对疾病的起源作更深入的钻研，那就无法接受现代科学的最新成果，妨害了中医的继续发展。
    中国古代医学是以阴阳五行的唯物主义哲学作为理论基础的，它一方面具有素朴的唯物主义因素，一方面也具有辩证法思想。中国古代医学认为自然界和自然界中的每一个具体的事物都有它的阴阳对立的两方面。事物就是在阴阳对立的矛盾中存在着。中医认为：阴阳二气的两种势力在人的身体内，如果能够维持正常的对立平衡状态，人就健康；如果不能维持正常的对立平衡状态，人就会生病。所以说：
      “阴平阳秘，精神乃治；阴阳离决，精气乃绝”（“内经”：生气通天论）。又说：
      “阴不胜其阳，则脉流薄〔迫〕疾〔急〕，并乃狂；阳不胜其阴，则五脏气争，九窍不通”（“内经”：生气通天论）。
    根据阴阳二气对立平衡的原则，从“内经”开始，就奠立了把疾病分为太阳，阳明、少阳，太阴，少阴，厥阴六种类型。
  “伤寒论”基本上是按照这种观点继续发展和丰富起来的。阎德润先生曾对中医的三阴三阳的分类作过科学的说明：
      “凡病之热者为阳，寒者为阴；实者为阳，虚者为阴。若以西医之名词注释，则病之属于进行性者为阳，属于退行性者为阴；机能亢进者为阳，机能衰减者为阴”（“伤寒论评释”，人民卫生出版社，7页）。
    当然，由于当时科学发展的局限性，古代医学家对人类的内脏及肢体的结构的认识还不能达到精密无误的程度。因而有些地方对于病理现象的解释不能令人满意。
    中国古代医学还正确地指出了人类生理的器官部位是相互影响，相互联系的整体。五行是不可分割的，有相生相克的关系，五脏也是整体，有相生相克的作用。如果某一部分的机构活动不正常，必然影响到其他有关机构。比如中医认为肝脏发生了阴阳失调的现象，就会影响到眼睛的视力，会影响到消化的不正常，也会影响到情绪容易激动等等。其他部门各器官也是这样。所以“头痛医头，脚痛医脚”成为中国医学理论对于形而上学观点的绝妙的讽刺。可惜我们今天也还有些医学家也存在着这类形而上学的观点。他们不但落后于今天先进的医学，甚至连二千多年前的医学中有价值的部分也还没有好好吸取。
    中国古代医学在二千多年前，就已指出生理现象和心理现象是互相联系的。“内经”中曾说过：肝脏的活动和愤怒的情绪相关联（“怒伤肝”）；心脏的活动和喜悦的情绪相关联（“喜伤心”）；脾脏的活动和思虑作用相关联（“思伤脾”）；肺脏的活动和忧郁的情绪相关联（“忧伤肺”）；肾脏的活动和恐惧的情绪相关联（“恐伤肾”）（以上见“内经”：阴阳应象大论及其他各篇）。
    现代科学业已证明人类心理活动是由于人类的分析器官受到外界刺激引起的大脑皮质的兴奋和抑制作用。心理活动和呼吸、消化、循环各个系统有内在的联系。由于科学的局限性，中国古代医学没有能够完全正确地说明这种关系。
    中国古代医学经常从整体的观点出发，所以反对孤立地认识问题的思想方法，所以对疾病和健康的关系也是联系来看的。因此，中国医学常把保健放在第一位，而把药物治疗放在次要的地位。中国医学主张：
    “动作以避寒，阴居以避暑，内无眷慕 之累，外无伸宦之形，此恬淡之世，邪不能深入也”（“内经”：移精变气论）。如果不能注意平日的卫生，就会招致危险的后果：
    “忧患缘其内，苦形伤其外，又失四时之从逆，寒暑之宜，……小病必甚，大病必死”（“内经”：移精变气论）。从维持健康的整体观念出发，中医树立了预防为主的保健观念：
      “是故圣人不治已病治未病……夫病已成而后药之，乱已成而后治之，譬犹渴而穿井，斗而铸锥，不亦晚乎？”（“内经”：四气调神大论）即使不得已而治疗时，中国医学主张要在早期进行治疗：
      “善治者，治皮毛（作者按：病未深入时即治疗），其次治肌肤，其次治筋脉，其次治六府，其次治五藏（脏）。治五藏（脏）者，半死半生也”（“内经”：阴阳应象大论）。
    总起来看，中国古代从科学实践中相当深刻地体现了辩证法的思想。它在医疗、营养、卫生、保健、生理、心理、病理各方面都具体运用了这一正确的观点。这种思想方法和观点是极可珍贵的，值得充分重视的。
    但是我们也必须承认中国古代辩证法还不可能发展到十分完善的地步。以“内经”为代表的中医思想方法也具有古代辩证法共同的弱点。自然现象、生命现象、病理现象是复杂的，远在二千多年以前的科学理论决不可能圆满地、深刻地认识这些规律，所以“内经”中也不免夹杂着许多不科学、神秘主义的成分。有些问题，当时的科学水平不能做出正确的解释，而勉强解释时，必然陷于牵强附会的错误。这些缺点都是无可隐瞒的。恩格斯的教导值得我们记住：
      “自然哲学所能用以执行这个任务的唯一办法，就是拿理想的、幻想的联系来代替它还不知道的真实的现象联系，拿虚构来替代缺乏的事实，单只在想像中把真实的缺陷填补起来。这样作时，自然哲学吐露了好多天才的思想和猜到了好多后来的发现，但也有过不少的废话和胡说”（“费尔巴哈与德国古典哲学的终结”）。
    中国古代医学的第一部经典著作“内经”，它的贡献不仅在于提供了治疗的方法，还在于建立了具有素朴唯物主义和自发辩证观点的医学理论，这种理论保证了中国古代医学从世界观上和唯心主义的巫术、迷信截然分开。同时，中国医学的理论的某些弱点、缺点也隐伏在这里。因为古代的唯物主义和古代的辩证法思想还不足以完全说明自然界，中间还缺少一段自然科学发展的过程。它的唯物主义还很粗糙，不能区分生理、生命和自然界其他现象的本质区别，它的辩证法思想也夹杂着笼统、混淆的弱点。这就妨碍了它进一步的发展。
    在今天，学习中医的人，固然要努力学习中医的医疗技术，学习中医的理论；但在掌握了中医的医疗技术，研究了中医理论中合理的内核的时候，还要努力学习自然科学和辩证唯物主义，以补救在长期停滞的旧时代中国医学所具有的弱点。只有这样，才能为进一步用现代先进的医学理论来予以整理改造打下基础。
