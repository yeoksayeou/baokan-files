The most important part of the preparation, the final balancing of the wage reform plan, is currently underway in Beijing. Recently, the heads of wage reform committees or wage reform offices from various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have participated in the National Wage Reform Plan Balancing Conference convened by the Ministry of Labor. After research and balancing at this conference, the wage reform plans for various industries and regions across the country will be finalized after being submitted to the State Council for approval.
