Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 18th: Bonn Dispatch: West German politicians belonging to different parties are voicing a chorus of demands for a change in the Adenauer government's strength-based diplomacy, and for improved relations with the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic. They believe that continuing to pursue a policy of strength can only hinder the reunification of Germany.

    The "Süddeutsche Zeitung" published a quote from the Chairman of the Social Democratic Party, Ollenhauer, which Ollenhauer made at a meeting of the Franco-Swabian local organization of the Social Democratic Party in Hamburg. Ollenhauer said: The Social Democratic Party will do its best to change West Germany's policies. Some countries pursuing a Western policy are already striving for reconciliation with the Soviet Union, but Adenauer still stubbornly pursues a policy of strength, considering the formation of an army of 500,000 men more important than anything else. Ollenhauer said: "Pursuing this policy can only sacrifice the reunification of Germany."

    Wehner, a Social Democrat and Chairman of the All-German Affairs Committee of the Federal Parliament, said at a meeting of a local organization of the Social Democratic Party that under the conditions of eased tensions, West Germany's foreign policy must be thoroughly revised. Wehner said that in order not to isolate West Germany, the West German government must establish friendly relations with neutral countries that do not participate in blocs, improve relations with Eastern European countries, and adjust relations with the German Democratic Republic.

    Wehner criticized West German Foreign Minister Brentano because Brentano expressed negative opinions on Churchill's speech suggesting that Western countries normalize relations with the Soviet Union.

    The All-German People's Party held a congress in Bochum, opposing the re-militarization of West Germany. Koch, a member of the party's standing committee, said: "Unification (of Germany) can be restored through international negotiations and the signing of agreements domestically."

    西德政界人士要求改变阿登纳政府的实力外交政策
    改善对苏联和德意志民主共和国的关系
    据新华社柏林18日电　波恩消息：属于不同政党的西德政界人士发出一片呼声，要求改变阿登纳政府的实力外交政策、要求同苏联以及德意志民主共和国改善关系。他们认为：继续执行实力政策只能阻挠德国的重新统一。
    “南德意志报”刊载了社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔的一段话，这段话是奥伦豪尔在社会民主党佛朗科西亚地方组织在汉堡举行的会议上说的。奥伦豪尔说：社会民主党将尽力争取改变西德的政策。一些奉行西方方针的国家已经在争取同苏联和解，而阿登纳却依旧独自奉行实力政策，把组成一支五十万人的军队看得比什么事情都重要。奥伦豪尔说：“奉行这种政策就只有牺牲德国的重新统一。”
    社会民主党人、联邦议院全德事务委员会主席魏纳在社会民主党的一个地方组织的会议上说：在紧张局势已经缓和的条件下，必须彻底重新修正西德的外交政策。魏纳说，为了不使西德孤立，西德政府必须同不参加集团的中立国家建立友好的关系、改善同东欧国家的关系以及调整同德意志民主共和国的关系。
    魏纳批评西德外交部长勃伦塔诺，因为勃伦塔诺对丘吉尔发表的建议西方国家同苏联关系正常化的演说表示了否定的意见。
    全德人民党在波鸿举行了大会，反对西德重新军国主义化。这个党的常务委员会委员科赫说：“通过国际谈判以及在国内签订协定的方法能够恢复（德国）统一。”
