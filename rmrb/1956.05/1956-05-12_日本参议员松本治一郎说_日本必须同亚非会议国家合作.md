Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: Japanese Senator Matsumoto Jiichiro said on the 9th that Japan must find ways to cooperate with all other Asian and African countries that participated in the Bandung Conference, in order to avoid becoming an orphan not only in the East but in the whole world.

The Socialist, who had just returned from a foreign visit, said that his deepest impression during his trip was that the Asian-African Conference had achieved concrete results in the Middle East countries, especially in the current dramatic changes of nationalism in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.

    日本参议员松本治一郎说
    日本必须同亚非会议国家合作
    据新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本参议员松本治一郎在九日说：日本必须设法同其他一切参加万隆会议的亚非国家合作，以避免不仅是在东方，而且在全世界成为一个孤儿。
    这位刚刚从国外访问回国的社会党人说：在他的旅行中，他最深刻的印象是，亚非会议在中近东各国，特别是在摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚和突尼斯目前的民族主义的剧烈变化中已经收到了具体的效果。
