    A Single Word's Difference Causes Much Trouble
    To the Editor:
    Regarding the matter of reporting on agricultural production increases for awards in 1955, our department made a request to the General Bureau of Propaganda of the Ministry of Agriculture by long-distance telephone in early April; the reply received at that time was to submit the report to the central authorities by the end of April.
    On April 14th, we received a telegram from the General Bureau of Propaganda of the Ministry of Agriculture, requiring all provinces to submit the list of award recipients within "five days." This disrupted our original work plan. Consequently, two comrades worked day and night, constantly making long-distance calls to urge counties to report the list of award recipients; some counties, because the phone call was unclear, even sent people specifically to deliver the materials. As a result, long-distance calls were made 101 standard times, and the five counties sent material delivery people who spent a total of thirteen working days. The emergency task was finally completed, but the reporting time was still one day later than the deadline set by the General Bureau of Propaganda of the Ministry of Agriculture!
    Unexpectedly, on April 26th, the General Bureau of Propaganda of the Ministry of Agriculture issued an instruction stating that the previous telegram mistakenly stated "report everything within five days" when it should have been "report everything within five months." This truly left us feeling both amused and helpless. It turned out that the emergency measures we took were not for an emergency task at all. The difference of one word in the superior's telegram caused so much confusion in our work!

    一字之差忙坏人
    编辑同志：
    关于1955年农业增产报请奖励的问题，我厅曾在四月初用长途电话向农业部宣传总局请示；当时得到的答复是，在四月底报到中央。
    四月十四日，我们接到农业部宣传总局的电报，要各省把报奖名单在“五日内”报上。这把我们原来的工作部署打乱了。于是，两位同志日夜加班，不断打长途电话向各县催报受奖名单；有的县因为电话听不清楚，还特意派专人送材料来。结果，长途电话打了101标准次，五个县送材料的人共计花了十三个工作日，紧急任务总算是完成了，不过上报的时间还是比农业部宣传总局的限期迟了一天！
    事出意外，四月二十六日农业部宣传总局发来一件指示，说是上次的电报里把“五月内报齐”误为“五日内报齐”了。这真使我们有些哭笑不得。原来，我们采取紧急办法来完成的并不是什么紧急任务。上级电报中的一字之差，给我们的工作造成多么大的忙乱！
