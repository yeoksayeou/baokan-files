Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 5th: Bonn Dispatch: The West German Federal Parliament passed the first reading of the universal conscription bill proposed by the Adenauer government on May 4th, after nine hours of intense debate. During the vote, the Social Democratic Party's members of parliament unanimously raised their hands in opposition to the bill.

Before the debate began, the Adenauer government submitted a memorandum to the Federal Parliament defending the conscription law, demanding the establishment of a West German army of 500,000 men based on compulsory conscription.

West German Defense Minister Blank also spoke in the Federal Parliament, vigorously demanding the speedy passage of the conscription bill. Using West Germany's obligations under the Paris Accords as a pretext, he also proposed that in addition to establishing a regular army of 500,000 men, West Germany should also have as many "fully and comprehensively trained reserves" as possible.

Social Democratic Party member of parliament, Eler, spoke against the conscription bill. He emphasized the harm that the passage of the conscription law would cause to both East and West Germany. He said that West Germany's implementation of conscription might lead to "a war between brothers." Eler's words were met with loud cheers from some members of parliament.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 6th: Nuremberg Dispatch: More than 2,500 young metal industry workers in Nuremberg held a torchlight parade on the evening of May 4th to oppose West German rearmament and the implementation of conscription. The marchers shouted slogans: "Stop war propaganda, smash military laws!"

The marching masses enthusiastically responded to the call made by the West German Metal Industry Union Youth Representatives Conference being held in Nuremberg – to oppose rearmament and conscription.

　　西德青年高呼：“停止战争宣传，粉碎军事法律！”
    新华社柏林5日电　波恩消息：西德联邦议院五月四日在经过九小时的激烈辩论以后，一读通过了阿登纳政府提出的普遍征兵法案。在表决时，社会民主党的议员一致举手反对这个法案。
    在开始辩论以前，阿登纳政府向联邦议院提出了一个为征兵法辩护的备忘录，要求在强迫征兵的基础上，建立一支五十万人的西德军队。
    西德国防部长布兰克也在联邦议院发言，竭力要求尽速通过征兵法案。他以西德在巴黎协定承担了义务为口实，并且提出：除了建立五十万正规军外，西德还应当有尽可能多的“受过充分全面训练的后备军”。
    社会民主党议员埃勒发言反对征兵法案。他强调指出通过征兵法对于东西两个德国的危害性。他说：西德实行征兵可能会造成“兄弟之间的战争”。埃勒的话博得了一些议员的高声喝采。
    新华社柏林6日电　纽伦堡消息：纽伦堡的金属工业青年工人二千五百多人在五月四日晚举行火炬游行，反对西德重新武装和实行征兵。游行的人们高呼口号：“停止战争宣传，粉碎军事法律！”
    游行的群众热烈响应正在纽伦堡举行的西德金属工业工会青年代表会议所提出的号召——反对重新武装和征兵。
