    The Central Delegation in the Yadong Area
    By our reporter Lin Gang
    The First Sub-Delegation of the Central Delegation came to the Himalayan Mountains and spent three pleasant and unforgettable days with the People's Liberation Army border troops stationed in the Yadong area and the local Tibetan people.

    The Yadong area is located in southern Tibet, comprising more than twenty villages and towns nestled in a green valley over a hundred li long in the central Himalayas. The climate here is warm, the scenery is beautiful, and it is known as the "Garden of Tibet." The troops stationed here have won the love of the Tibetan compatriots by exemplarily implementing the Party's ethnic and religious policies. The troops help the Tibetan compatriots with spring plowing and autumn harvesting, treat the Tibetans' illnesses, and also help Tibetan youths to study politics. The Tibetan compatriots also assist the troops in consolidating the border in various ways. The military and the people are as close as family. When the Central Delegation visited the troops, they conveyed the deep concern of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the 600 million people of the country for them.

    The center of the Yadong area is Xi Sima. Wang Zaitian (Mongolian), the head of the First Sub-Delegation, congratulated the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region at a mass meeting of 2,000 people held here on behalf of the people of all ethnic groups in the country. Chairman Mao badges and other souvenirs were distributed at the mass meeting. Many Tibetan compatriots took home the color painting of Chairman Mao with the Dalai Lama and Bainqen Erdini in the Tibetan Wood Sheep Year, nailed it to the wall, and hung new hadas on it.

    Wang Zaitian met with officials and headmen in the Yadong area, presented them with gifts, and held discussions. Dingjia, a Taiji (a rank for secular officials) of the Tibetan local government, had visited the interior of the motherland. He said at the symposium: We fully support the Dalai Lama's instruction to implement reforms from top to bottom in the Tibetan area at an appropriate time. Because reform is beneficial, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is a good example. I saw with my own eyes the wealthy life of the people of Inner Mongolia. We want to follow the path of the people of Inner Mongolia, which is what the people of Yadong want.

    In these few days, the Central National Song and Dance Troupe and the Chongqing Acrobatic Troupe performed day and night for the troops and Tibetans in the Xi Sima Square. Almost every program was requested to be performed "one more time." The Tibetans said: We have never seen such a good performance.

    On the morning of the 22nd, all members of the First Sub-Delegation of the Central Delegation, together with local Tibetan youths, troops and agency youths, and students from Yadong Elementary School, jointly climbed mountains for an outing. Young people of all ethnic groups held hands and talked cordially, took photos as souvenirs, recited poems, and exchanged gifts. Young people of all ethnic groups from all over the country said: The days in Yadong are unforgettable.

    中央代表团在亚东地区
    本报记者　林钢
    中央代表团第一分团来到了喜马拉雅山区，同驻守在亚东地区的人民解放军边疆部队和当地藏族人民，度过了愉快而难忘的三天。
    亚东地区在西藏南部，共二十多个村镇，座落在喜马拉雅山中部一条一百多华里长的绿色的峡谷里。这里气候温暖，风景幽美，有“西藏的花园”之称。驻守在这里的部队，因为模范地执行党的民族政策和宗教政策，得到了藏族同胞的热爱。部队帮助藏族同胞春耕、秋收，替藏胞治病，还帮助藏族青年学习政治。藏胞也从各方面协助部队巩固边疆。军民之间，亲如家人。中央代表团在访问部队的时候，向他们传达了党中央、毛主席和全国六亿人民对于他们的深切的关怀。
    亚东地区的中心是下司马，第一分团团长王再天（蒙族）在这里举行的二千人的群众大会上，代表全国各族人民，祝贺西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立。群众大会上分发了毛主席纪念章和其他纪念品。许多藏胞把毛主席在藏历木羊年同达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼合影的彩色画拿回家去，钉在墙上，挂上了新的哈达。
    王再天接见了亚东地区的官员和头人，向他们赠送礼品，并且举行座谈。西藏地方政府台吉（俗官级位称）丁甲曾经到祖国内地参观。他在座谈会上说：我们完全拥护达赖喇嘛提出的要在适当时机在西藏地区自上而下地实行改革的指示。因为改革有好处，内蒙古自治区就是好例子。我在那里亲眼看到了内蒙古人民的富裕生活。我们要走内蒙古人民的路，这是亚东人民的心里话。
    这几天，中央民族歌舞团和重庆杂技团日日夜夜在下司马的广场上，为部队和藏胞演出。几乎每一个节目都被要求“再来一次”。藏胞说：我们从来没有看过这样好的表演。
    二十二日上午，中央代表团第一分团全体人员同当地藏族青年、部队和机关青年、亚东小学学生，共同登山野游。各民族的青年手携着手亲切地交谈，摄影留念，朗诵诗歌，交换礼物。来自全国各地的各族青年都说：在亚东的日子是难忘的。
