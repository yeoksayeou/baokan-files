Creating Necessary Working Conditions for Scientists
Beijing Agricultural University Vice-President Shi Ping

With the development of socialist construction, science is also required to develop accordingly. Since liberation, the Party and the government have continuously created working conditions for scientists to ensure the smooth progress of scientific research. In the past six or seven years, scientists' working conditions have improved considerably: the research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have greatly expanded. Government departments of industry, agriculture, transportation, finance, law, and other sectors, as well as universities and colleges, have also established many new research institutions. The number of scientific research personnel has also greatly increased. The number of researchers in the Chinese Academy of Sciences system increased approximately tenfold from 1949 to 1954. Research institutions in various departments have also been equipped with a certain amount of manpower and experimental equipment, and many of the newly added equipment are the most modern. The government's investment in scientific research in the past six or seven years is incomparable to the period of Kuomintang reactionary rule. The investment in the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1954 increased approximately tenfold compared to 1950. Scientists are generally satisfied with the measures taken by the Party and the government. However, our country's socialist construction is developing rapidly, and the speed of scientific research development is still far from meeting the needs. In order to advance towards science and catch up with the world's advanced levels in a not-too-long period of time, the working conditions for scientific research created in the past are far from enough, and there are many urgent problems that need to be solved.

In the three months since the Party Central Committee convened the conference on intellectual issues, various relevant departments have done and are doing a lot of work in creating working conditions. Many departments, especially universities and colleges, have taken effective measures to reduce the time scientists spend on non-professional meetings and administrative affairs. Unnecessary social activities have also been reduced. Generally, efforts are being made to ensure that scientists have at least six-fifths of their working days (i.e., 40 hours per week) devoted to their professional work, with the remaining time used for political study, necessary meetings, and social activities. In order to solve the problem of scientific workers lacking necessary books and materials, many units have carried out necessary sorting of existing books and materials, and catalogs of a large number of books and materials have been opened, and are being ordered and negotiated; the system for reading materials has also been improved. The Beijing Library has established contact with the Moscow Lenin Library, and Chinese scientists can borrow books and periodicals from the Lenin Library through the Beijing Library. The library of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has produced microfilm copies of rare books for scientists to use as reference. In terms of working equipment, some are being planned, and some have already been ordered and added. In terms of equipping scientific research assistants and supplementing teaching assistants, some problems in personnel organization have been solved, and some personnel have been added. The salary and benefits of scientific workers are also being reasonably adjusted under possible conditions, and many good methods and systems have been created in terms of living and working environment. In general, during this period, all parties are working hard to create more and better working conditions for scientific workers, which has greatly increased the enthusiasm of many scientific workers in their research work.

However, during this period, the leadership in some units has not paid enough attention to this work. Some emphasize objective difficulties, emphasize the heavy production tasks, and say they don't have time to deal with this issue; some use the excuse of waiting for instructions from higher authorities and lack initiative; some even hold the attitude of "old problems, nothing new." Some cadres have egalitarian ideas about improving the living conditions and working environment of scientists. The work of purchasing imported instruments, books, and materials has been improved very slowly. The existence of these shortcomings has dragged on some problems that could have been solved earlier, and some have wasted time in empty talk. This is clearly a lack of understanding of the Party Central Committee's policy on intellectual issues, and an erroneous attitude of "none of my business" towards the issue of catching up with the world's scientific level. This must be resolutely corrected.

The issue of creating more and better working conditions for scientific research is complex. From state organs to every unit, there are many aspects to the problem, and they are interrelated. But the problems are nothing more than two aspects: those that the unit can solve and those that the unit cannot solve. Those that the unit can solve must be solved quickly; those that seem to be unsolvable by the unit should also strive to solve themselves, or solve a part of it first. With close cooperation with relevant parties, it may be possible to solve another part. This will solve many problems. What remains are only those that cost a lot of money but the budget has not yet been confirmed, those that lack labor and materials and are temporarily difficult to overcome, and those that cannot be solved immediately domestically, which should be gradually solved over a longer period of time. In short, each unit should make an overall consideration and analysis of this issue, and make a plan based on the tasks of scientific research and the scientists' expertise. The country's scientific long-term plan is comprehensive, and the scientific plan of each unit is based on the tasks it undertakes and what people do. The Party's direction and policy of developing science are already clearly defined, and the plan for each unit should not be difficult, and should not be delayed. After having a plan, various problems can be solved creatively according to needs and possibilities. Many units still do not have an overall plan and are only dealing with things piecemeal. This situation must be changed immediately. Higher-level leading organs should seize the time to conduct an inspection in the near future.

Catching up with the world's scientific level is better the sooner, but it is also impossible to complete twelve years of work in two or three years. Things that do not conform to the objective laws of development are difficult to achieve. There are many difficulties in creating certain working conditions, so we must distinguish between the important and the urgent, and first focus on solving the main problems. At present, the main thing is to oppose conservative thinking, but being too hasty is also inappropriate, and the practice of equal distribution is also undesirable.

In order to create conditions, it is necessary to first check whether the existing conditions have been fully utilized. Has the unit's equipment been fully utilized? Has the manpower been fully utilized? Have we created what we can create ourselves? We cannot imagine that the country's current financial resources are unlimited. They are still relatively difficult, and the shortage of cadres is also serious. Therefore, the creation of conditions must be strictly in accordance with the spirit of streamlining and economy, to ensure that the main aspects are fully satisfied, and to strive to avoid extravagance and waste. For example, if domestic goods can be used, do not use foreign goods, and if the instrument is precise enough, do not unnecessarily demand greater precision, and so on.

The work of creating more and better working conditions for scientific workers has only just begun, although much has been done in the past few months. The good systems that have been established should continue to be maintained and improved, so that they become a normal order and prevent halfway abandonment. The work that has already begun to be prepared should be prepared more actively, and those that have not started should start immediately. The content of working conditions is multifaceted, including the specific conditions of books, materials, international scientific information materials, instruments, reagents, farms, experimental factories, studios, etc.; the organizational leadership work of establishing scientific institutions, international academic exchanges, scientists' contact with reality and participation in activities, studying Marxism-Leninism, and learning foreign languages; and the active improvement or creation of cadre allocation and training, time guarantee, research funding, etc. The country's scientific work is an indivisible whole. Scientists should conduct research around the country's scientific plan, and all relevant parties should work together in terms of manpower and material resources to prevent departmentalism and sectarian sentiments.

It must be deeply recognized that mankind has entered the atomic age and is facing a new scientific, technological, and industrial revolution. And our country's scientific and cultural strength is much smaller than that of the Soviet Union and other world powers, and its quality is also much lower, which is very disproportionate to the needs of our socialist construction with a population of 600 million. We must catch up quickly and strive to expand and improve our country's scientific and cultural strength as quickly as possible, and catch up with the world's advanced levels in a not-too-long period of time. For the realization of this great task, it is of great significance to fully create conditions for scientific research.

　　为科学家创设必需的工作条件
    北京农业大学副校长  施平
    随着社会主义建设事业的发展，需要科学也有相应的发展。解放以来，党和政府曾不断地为科学家们创设着工作条件，以保证科学研究工作的顺利进行。六、七年来，科学家们的工作条件，已经有了相当的改善：中国科学院系统的研究机构大大扩充了。政府的工业、农业、交通、财经、政法等部门以及高等学校，也新设立了许多研究机构。科学研究人员也大大增加了。中国科学院系统的研究人员，1954年比1949年增加了十倍左右。在各部门的研究机构中，也都配备了一定的人力，都有一定的试验设备，许多新增加的设备，都是最新式的。六、七年来政府投入科学研究的资金，是国民党反动统治时期所不能比的。1954年中国科学院的投资款额比1950年增加了大约十倍。科学家们对于党和政府的措施，一般地是满意的。但是，我们国家的社会主义建设事业在飞跃地发展着，科学研究工作发展的速度仍远不能适应需要，为了向科学大进军，在不太长的时间里赶上世界先进水平，过去所创设的科学研究的工作条件，就显得很不够了，有许多急迫的问题须要解决。
    党中央召开知识分子问题的会议以后的三个多月的时间里，在创设工作条件方面，各有关部门，都做了和正在做着许多工作。许多部门，特别是高等学校，大都采取了有效的措施，减少了科学家们用在非业务性会议和行政事务上的时间，非必要的社会活动也减少了，一般地都力求做到保证科学家们至少有六分之五的工作日（即每周四十小时）用在自己的业务上，其余的时间用在政治学习、必要的会议和社会活动上。为了解决科学工作者缺乏必要的图书资料的问题，许多单位对原有的图书资料进行了必要的整理，大批图书资料的目录已开出来，正在订购和接洽中；阅读资料的制度也已经得到改善。北京图书馆已经与莫斯科列宁图书馆取得联系，中国科学家可以通过北京图书馆向列宁图书馆借阅书刊。中国科学院图书馆摄制了稀少图书的显微影片供科学家作参考。在工作设备方面，有的正在做规划，有的已经进行订购添设。在配备科学研究助手和补充教学辅助人员方面，已经解决了人员编制上的一些问题，部分的已经增补了一些人员。科学工作者们的工资待遇，在可能的条件下也正在进行着合理的调整，在生活、工作环境等方面，创造了许多很好的方法和制度。总起来看，在这一个时期中，各方面都正努力为科学工作者们创造更多更好的工作条件，使许多科学工作者大大提高了他们从事研究工作的热情。
    但是，在这个时期中，有些单位的领导方面对这一工作还不够重视。有的强调客观困难，强调生产任务重，来不及处理这个问题；有的托词等待上级指示，主动性不够，有的甚至抱着“老问题，没有什么稀奇”的态度。有一些干部对于科学家的生活待遇和工作环境的改善有着平均主义的思想。进口仪器、图书资料的采购工作改进得很慢。这些缺点的存在，使一些可能及早解决的问题拖沓着，有的在空谈里混掉了时间。这显然是对中央关于知识分子问题的方针政策缺乏了解，对追赶世界科学水平的问题采取了“事不关己”的错误态度。这是必须切实改正的。
    为科学研究工作创设更多、更好的工作条件的问题是复杂的，从国家机关到每一个单位，都有许多方面的问题，而且相互关联着，但问题不外两方面：本单位能解决的和本单位不能解决的。本单位能解决的就要抓紧解决；看来不是本单位能解决的问题也要力求自己解决，或者先解决一部分，同有关方面密切合作又可能解决一部分。这就能解决很多的问题，剩下的只有那些花钱比较大而预算尚未肯定，人工材料缺乏而暂时难以克服的，以及国内没有条件立即解决的问题，才应在较长时期内逐步解决。总之，各单位对于这个问题，应当作一个全盘的考虑和分析，要根据科学研究工作的任务，以及科学家的专长等作出一个规划。国家的科学远景规划是全面的，各个单位的科学规划则是由所负担的任务和有什么人做什么事出发。国家发展科学的方针方向都已经明确地规定了，各单位的规划也就不难了，不应该等待拖沓。有了规划以后，就可以按需要和可能创造性地将各种问题分别加以解决。许多单位到现在为止还没有一个全盘打算，只是零星应付，这样的情况要立即改变。上级领导机关应在最近时期内抓紧作一次检查。
    赶上世界科学水平，愈快愈好，但也不能把十二年的工作要求在两三年内做完，不合乎客观发展规律的事，是难以做到的。某些工作条件的创设，困难不少，要分别轻重缓急，先集中解决主要的问题。目前主要是反对保守思想，但过急也不妥当，平均配备的做法也是不应该的。
    为了创造条件，首先要检查是否已经充分利用了已有的条件。本单位的设备是否充分利用了？人力是否充分发挥了？能够自己创造的是否创造了？不能把目前国家的财力设想为无限的，它还是比较困难的，干部不足也是严重的，所以创设条件必须严格地按照精简节约精神办事，保证主要的方面得到充分的满足，要努力避免铺张浪费的现象。例如可以用本国货的就不要用外国货，仪器够精密了的就不要无益地要求更精密，等等。
    为科学工作者们创设更多更好的工作条件的工作，虽然这几个月做了不少，但还只是开头。已经建立的良好制度要继续保持和改进，使它成为正常秩序，防止半途而废。已经开头准备的工作要更积极地准备，没有开头的要立即开头。工作条件的内容是多方面的，有图书、资料、国际科学情况材料、仪器、试剂、农场、实验工厂、工作室等的具体条件；有建立科学机构、国际学术交流、科学家接触实际和参加活动、学习马克思列宁主义、学习外国语等的组织领导工作；还有干部配备和培养、时间保证、研究经费等等都要积极改进或创设起来。国家的科学工作，是一个不可分割的整体，科学家应围绕国家的科学规划进行研究工作，各有关方面要在人力物力等方面通力合作，防止本位主义和宗派情绪。
    必须深刻认识到，人类已经走进了原子时代，面临着一个新的科学技术和工业革命的前夕。而我国的科学文化力量比苏联和其他世界大国小得多，同时在质量上也要低得多，这是同我们拥有六亿人口的这样一个大国的社会主义建设事业的需要很不相称的。我们必须急起直追，力求尽可能迅速地扩大和提高我国的科学文化力量，而在不太长的时间里赶上世界先进水平。为了这个伟大任务的实现，为科学研究工作充分地创设条件，是具有重大意义的。
