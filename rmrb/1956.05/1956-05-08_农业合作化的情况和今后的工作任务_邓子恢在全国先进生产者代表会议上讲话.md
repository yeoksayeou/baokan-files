　　The Situation of Agricultural Cooperation and Future Work Tasks
    Deng Zihui's Speech at the National Conference of Advanced Producers

    Deng Zihui, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the Seventh Office, focused on the situation of the agricultural cooperation movement in the past six months and future work tasks in his speech at the National Conference of Advanced Producers on the 7th.

    Deng Zihui pointed out in his speech that the basic realization of agricultural cooperation throughout the country is not the end of the matter, but the beginning. He said that transforming from individual economy to collective economy, from small production to large production, is a huge revolution, which not only requires a new management system, but also new technological reforms and new technical equipment, as well as scientific knowledge, until the completion of agricultural mechanization. Therefore, it requires assistance from the working class intellectuals, scientists, and especially advanced producers and advanced workers in various aspects.

    When introducing the situation of the agricultural cooperation movement in the past six months, Deng Zihui said that the socialist agricultural collective economy now occupies an absolute advantage in rural areas, and the small-scale peasant economy has been basically transformed. The progress of the movement was generally centered on elementary agricultural cooperation before December last year, and then shifted to advanced cooperation after December. After March this year, due to the spring plowing production, the work of establishing new cooperatives, merging large cooperatives, and transitioning to advanced cooperatives in various places has been successively stopped, and the work of rectifying and consolidating cooperatives has begun. According to statistics in mid-April this year, there are more than 1.08 million cooperatives of all sizes across the country. More than 106 million farmer households have joined the cooperatives, accounting for about 90% of the total number of farmer households in the country. Among them, there are more than 260,000 advanced cooperatives, with more than 66 million farmer households, accounting for 56% of the total number of farmer households in the country, and 820,000 elementary cooperatives, with nearly 40 million farmer households, accounting for 34% of the total number of farmer households in the country. Judging from the degree of advanced collectivization in various provinces and regions, the number of farmers participating in advanced cooperatives in the six provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Guangxi, and Qinghai, and the suburbs of the three cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, has reached more than 90%, and Liaoning Province has reached more than 86%; Inner Mongolia, Jiangsu, and Anhui have reached more than 70%; Shandong, Hubei, and Jiangxi have reached more than 60%; Zhejiang, Fujian, and Shaanxi have reached more than 50%; and advanced cooperatives in other provinces also account for a certain proportion. It is expected that there will be another upsurge this winter and next spring, and advanced cooperation can be achieved in the vast majority of provinces across the country. According to local inspections, about 90% of these newly built cooperatives, large merged cooperatives, and advanced cooperatives are relatively solid, with good production work and high morale among the members. The progress of the entire cooperative movement is healthy and smooth.

    He said that with the basic realization of agricultural cooperation throughout the country, especially the huge increase in the proportion of advanced cooperation, the rural productive forces have been greatly liberated, the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of farmers have been greatly stimulated, and the attendance rate and labor productivity of farmers have been greatly improved. Production undertakings that could not be undertaken or even dared to be imagined by individual farmers in the past can now be carried out with the conditions and strength. Therefore, along with agricultural cooperation, a high tide of agricultural production has emerged across the country. The promulgation of the central government's "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) from 1956 to 1967" has further promoted the growth of this high tide. In all provinces and cities across the country, regardless of east, west, north, or south, and regardless of men, women, old, or young, all those who can participate in labor are involved in the production movement centered on water conservancy construction and manure accumulation. Freezing three feet, chipping ice to dig wells, bitter cold wind, drainage and mud digging, this kind of tenacious and brave collective labor of farmers marching towards nature, for the first time in Chinese history, turned "winter leisure" into "winter busy," and the majesty of nature also bowed for the first time in the face of the passionate labor of farmers. Deng Zihui said that if there are no special natural disasters this year, it is entirely certain that production will increase.

    He said that with the realization of agricultural cooperation, the political situation in rural areas has also undergone tremendous changes. This is first manifested in further strengthening the connection between the Party and the peasants and further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. Of course, in the past, the relationship between the Party and the peasants has always been close, and the worker-peasant alliance has been consolidated. However, for a long time in the past, farmers were a decentralized individual economy, and this individual economy had some contradictions with socialism. Today, the countryside has basically been collectivized, and the future worker-peasant alliance is based on a new socialist foundation, which will inevitably achieve further consolidation. This is conceivable. With the realization of cooperation, the unity within the peasants and the unity between poor and middle peasants have also been further strengthened. The socialist collective production and common prosperity economic relationship connects them more closely, which is a huge change. Due to the development of cooperative production and the implementation of diversified operations, it is easy to expand the scope of employment in rural areas, to arrange and take care of the lonely, widowed, elderly, and weak, and to achieve the best use of talent, which is also unprecedented in the history of agriculture in our country. With the realization of cooperation, workers and farmers are further closely integrated in building socialism, and the poor and middle peasants are further united, which makes the past landlord elements, rich peasant elements, counter-revolutionary elements, and other bad elements completely isolated, which makes it entirely possible for the Party and the People's Government to finally eliminate capitalism in the countryside and eliminate all exploitative systems.

    Deng Zihui pointed out that developing agricultural production economically, further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance politically, consolidating the unity of the poor and middle peasants, disintegrating and transforming landlords and rich peasants, and eliminating the last social basis of capitalism in rural areas, this is the unprecedented and profound change caused by the cooperative movement in the rural areas of our country, and it is also the great historical role played by cooperation in the entire socialist revolution in our country. Undoubtedly, smoothly attracting 500 million farmers into cooperation in a short period of time and transforming from individual economy to collective economy is not only a great victory for the Chinese revolution, but also a pioneering undertaking of great historical significance in the world.

    Deng Zihui then said that the above-mentioned achievements do not mean that there are no errors and shortcomings in our cooperative movement. There are still many errors and shortcomings, mainly: First, some agricultural production cooperatives have not implemented the central government's policy of running cooperatives diligently and frugally. They did not proceed from actual needs and possibilities, and prematurely carried out many non-productive basic construction projects, and invested too much in productive basic construction projects that are not urgently needed at present, wasting a lot of manpower, financial resources, and materials; second, some agricultural production cooperatives have a single production, only pay attention to increasing grain and cotton production, and ignore other cash crops and sideline production; third, due to the rapid progress of the movement, the construction of a small number of cooperatives is very rough. The labor organization and management in these cooperatives are still quite chaotic, the livestock breeding and management system is unsound, and some cooperatives still have some specific policy issues (such as unreasonable pricing of cattle and farm tools, unpaid entry of forest trees and fruit trees into the cooperatives or too low prices, and forced investment by members, etc.) that have not been resolved, so some members' ideological concerns have not been eliminated, resulting in abnormal phenomena such as not cherishing forest trees, weak livestock deaths, and members being unwilling to invest even if they have money, and not daring to buy consumer goods. All these problems must be solved quickly; various places are also starting to solve them.

    After analyzing in detail the reasons for the victory of the cooperative movement, Deng Zihui pointed out the work that should be done in the future. He said that in addition to continuing to absorb farmers who have not yet joined the cooperatives to participate in the cooperatives and merging the elementary cooperatives and small cooperatives into advanced cooperatives, the main task in the future is to consolidate the existing cooperatives. He said that consolidation work is multi-faceted, and the central link is to ensure that the cooperatives continuously increase production and ensure that the members continuously increase their income.

    Regarding ensuring that cooperatives increase production, he pointed out: (1) Each agricultural production cooperative should, according to the various production increase measures proposed in the National Agricultural Development Program and in conjunction with its own specific circumstances, seize the main key to production increase, vigorously carry it out, and implement it to the end, preventing the generalization of production. (2) While ensuring the increase in grain and cotton production, it is necessary to pay attention to the development of diversified operations that are combined with agriculture in accordance with local conditions, such as forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, horticulture, transportation, livestock and poultry breeding, handicrafts, and other sideline production. In agriculture, the production of grain crops and other cash crops should also be properly arranged. He said that if the current tendency of single production in some cooperatives is not changed, the result may be that the cooperatives increase production but do not increase value, which is not beneficial to the cooperatives themselves. On the other hand, it is also not conducive to the balance of the entire national economy. The reduction of some cash crops and sideline products often involves all aspects of social production and life. Therefore, a cautious attitude must be adopted in the current economic reorganization of rural areas. All cash crops and sideline production that were originally habitually operated and profitable in the local area must be continued by the cooperatives or encouraged by the members to continue operating and developing, and must not be reorganized indiscriminately. (3) To do a good job in the operation and management of cooperatives. If the cooperative does not have a specific division of labor, a clear production responsibility system, and a quota management system, it will inevitably lead to chaos. Therefore, the cooperative must do a good job in fixing production teams, fixing cultivated areas, and fixing cattle and farm tools, etc., and must formulate labor quotas and implement piece-rate wages or contracting production, extra rewards, and other systems. (4) According to the current management capacity of general cadres, the leadership structure of the cooperative is generally better with a two-level system, that is, the cooperative's management committee as one level, and the field production team or sideline group as one level. Large cooperatives with thousands of households or more can consider a three-level system, but too many levels will increase the difficulty of leadership. Therefore, the scale of the cooperative should not be too large, and one or two hundred households in mountainous areas and three or five hundred households in plains are more appropriate. After the cooperative is formed, it should be stable for several years and should not be merged every year. (5) To pay close attention to the promotion of advanced experience, which is the most important method to promote production, give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses, and educate the masses. The so-called advanced experience should include production technology and management, etc. For this reason, advanced producer conferences, cooperative representative conferences, training courses, exhibitions, etc. in agricultural production should be held regularly.

    In terms of guaranteeing the increase of income for members, Deng Zihui pointed out: (1) It is necessary to recognize that this is a major policy issue. The distribution problem is an important aspect of production relations. Reasonable distribution can promote the development of production, and unreasonable distribution will also affect the non-development of production, affect the relationship between members and cadres, affect the relationship between members and members, and even affect the consolidation of cooperatives. Therefore, all cadres must attach great importance to this work ideologically to ensure that members' income increases every year. (2) It is necessary to implement the central government's policy of running cooperatives diligently and frugally, strive to increase production, reduce expenses, and overcome extravagance and waste. All non-productive expenditures such as hygiene, sports, culture, entertainment, etc., as well as bereavement, relief, and subsidy expenses, must be controlled within the scope that the public welfare fund can bear. Long-term basic construction projects that have no income in the current year must take into account the actual needs, distinguish between priorities, and act according to their capabilities. There must be no thoughts of "everything is flourishing" or "one step to the sky." (3) Various places should stipulate a certain proportion to limit various expenditures and public accumulation. For example, current production costs can generally be stipulated to not exceed 15% to 20% of the total income of the year, the work point subsidies for cadres who are detached from production and semi-detached from production should not exceed 2% of the total labor days of the entire cooperative, and the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund should generally not exceed 8% of the net income. In short, it is required to ensure that after deducting the above-mentioned expenses and public grain burden from the total income of the cooperative, 60% to 70% is allocated to the members, so as to strive for 90% of the members to increase their income. (4) In order to ensure the increase of income for members, it is also necessary to establish a collective leadership within the cooperative, a democratic centralism that consults on matters and divides responsibilities, to carry out criticism and self-criticism, to establish a anonymous voting election system, to establish a financial management system, to oppose corruption and waste, and to prevent and overcome commandism.

    In his speech, Deng Zihui also talked about issues related to workers and other urban people. He said that this issue is how to deal with the privately owned land left in the countryside by the working people who live in the city. He believes that this land can be handed over to the cooperative for use. When they return to live in their hometowns in the future, they can join the cooperative at any time. If they do not want to join the cooperative, they still have the right to receive a piece of land to operate on their own. Among them, those who have traditionally relied on obtaining land compensation to help solve their living difficulties due to poverty, the cooperative will still take necessary measures to take care of them.

    Deng Zihui especially mentioned at the end of his speech that he hopes that the advanced producer representatives from state-owned farms, ranches, tractor stations, pumping stations, water conservancy engineering departments, forestry industry departments, state-owned afforestation departments, and meteorological stations, etc., participating in this conference can further strengthen their ties with local cooperatives and use their advanced experience and advanced spirit to help farmers run the cooperatives well. He hopes that the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers will support and encourage farmers to run the cooperatives well in all aspects, and hopes that the vast number of demobilized and returned veterans will participate in the cooperatives and play a vanguard and backbone role.

### 农业合作化的情况和今后的工作任务  邓子恢在全国先进生产者代表会议上讲话

　　农业合作化的情况和今后的工作任务
    邓子恢在全国先进生产者代表会议上讲话
    国务院副总理兼第七办公室主任邓子恢，七日在全国先进生产者代表会议上着重讲述了半年来农业合作化运动的情况和今后的工作任务。
    邓子恢在讲话中指出，现在全国已经基本上实现了农业合作化，但这并不是事情的结束，而是事情的开端。他说，从个体经济变为集体经济，从小生产变为大生产，这是一个巨大的革命，这不仅需要有一套新的经营管理制度，而且需要有新的技术改革和新的技术设备，需要科学知识，一直到完成农业机械化为止。因此，就需要有工人阶级知识分子、科学家，特别是先进生产者和先进工作者多方面的帮助。
    邓子恢在介绍半年来农业合作化运动的情况的时候说，现在社会主义的农业集体经济，在农村中已经占绝对优势，小农经济已基本上被改造过来。运动的进程，大体在去年十二月以前是以初级农业合作化为中心，十二月以后，转入以高级合作化为中心；到今年三月以后，由于进行春耕生产，各地建新社并大社和转高级社的工作已经先后停止，转入整顿和巩固合作社的工作。根据今年四月中旬统计，全国大小合作社共有108万多个。加入合作社的农户，有一亿零六百万户以上，约占全国农户总数的90％。其中高级社有二十六万多个，入社农户六千六百多万户，占全国总农户的56％，初级社八十二万个，入社农户近四千万户，占全国总农户的34％。从各省区高级化的程度来看，河北、山西、吉林、黑龙江、广西、青海六省和北京、天津、上海三市的郊区，参加高级社的农户已经达到90％以上，辽宁省达86％以上；内蒙古、江苏、安徽达70％以上；山东、湖北、江西达60％以上；浙江、福建、陕西达50％以上；其余各省的高级社也占有一定的比重。预计今冬明春再有一个高潮，全国绝大多数省分都可以实现高级合作化。这些新建社和合并起来的大社和高级社，根据各地检查，90％左右都是比较巩固的，生产工作做得好，社员的情绪也高。整个合作化运动的进行是健康的顺利的。
    他说，随着全国范围内基本上实现农业合作化，特别是其中高级合作化比重的巨大增长，大大解放了农村的生产力，激发了广大农民的生产积极性和创造性，大大提高了农民的劳动出勤率和劳动生产率；过去为个体农民所不能举办甚至不敢设想的生产事业，现在也有条件、有力量来进行了。因此随着农业合作化的同时，在全国范围内出现了农业生产的高潮，中央“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）”的公布，更促进了这一高潮的增长。在全国各省市，地无分东西南北，人无分男女老少，凡能参加劳动的，都卷入以兴修水利和积肥为中心的生产运动中来，冰冻三尺，削冰掏井，寒风凛冽，排水挖泥，这种向自然进军的农民的顽强勇敢的集体劳动，在中国历史上第一次把“冬闲”变为“冬忙”，大自然的威严也第一次在农民的热情劳动面前低头。邓子恢说，今年如果没有特殊的自然灾害，增加生产是完全可以肯定的。
    他说，随着农业合作化的实现，农村的政治情况也起了巨大的变化。这首先表现在进一步加强了党和农民之间的联系和进一步巩固了工农联盟。当然，在过去，党和农民的关系始终是亲密的，工农联盟是巩固的。但在过去很长时期内，农民是分散的个体经济，而这种个体经济同社会主义是有某些矛盾的，今天农村已经基本上合作化，今后的工农联盟是建立在新的社会主义的基础之上，从而必将达到进一步的巩固，这是可以想到的。随着合作化的实现，也进一步加强农民内部的团结，加强贫农、中农之间的团结。社会主义的集体生产、共同富裕的经济关系，把他们更密切的联系起来，这是一个巨大的变化。由于合作社生产的发展、实行多种经营，就便于在农村中扩大就业范围，便于安置和照顾孤寡老弱，便于做到人尽其才各得其所，这也是我国农业历史上所从未有过的。随着合作化的实现，工人和农民在建设社会主义中进一步密切结合和贫农、中农之间进一步团结，这就使过去的地主分子、富农分子、反革命分子以及其他坏分子完全陷于孤立，这就使党和人民政府有完全可能来最后消灭农村的资本主义，消灭一切剥削制度。
    邓子恢指出，在经济上发展农业生产，在政治上进一步巩固工农联盟，巩固贫中农团结，分化和改造地主富农，消灭资本主义在农村中最后的社会基础，这就是合作化运动在我国农村中所引起的空前深刻的变化，也是合作化在我国整个社会主义革命中所引起的伟大的历史作用。无疑地，在短期间内把五亿农民顺利地吸引到合作化中来，由个体经济改造成为集体经济，这不仅是中国革命的伟大胜利，而且在世界上也是具有伟大历史意义的创举。
    邓子恢接着说，以上所说的成绩并不意味着我们的合作化运动就没有错误和缺点了。错误和缺点还是不少的，主要是：第一，有一部分农业生产合作社，没有贯彻执行中央所指示的勤俭办社的方针。它们不从实际的需要和可能出发，过早地举办许多非生产性的基本建设，当前并不急需的生产性的基本建设也投资过多，浪费了许多人力财力和物力；第二，有一部分农业生产合作社，生产单一化，只注意粮棉增产，而忽视其他经济作物和副业生产；第三，由于运动进行的迅速，小部分社的建社工作很粗糙。在这些社内劳动组织、经营管理还相当混乱，牲畜饲养管理制度不健全，有的社还有一些具体的政策问题（如耕牛农具作价不合理，林木果树无代价入社或作价太低和强迫社员投资等）没有获得解决，因而有一部分社员的思想顾虑还没有解除，从而产生不爱护林木、牲口瘦弱死亡、社员有钱不肯投资、不敢买消费品等不正常现象。所有这些问题，都必须迅速加以解决；各地也正在着手解决中。
    邓子恢在详细地分析了合作化运动获得胜利的原因后，指出了今后应做的工作。他说，今后的任务除了继续吸收还没有入社的农民参加合作社，把初级社小社合并升为高级社外，主要任务是巩固现有合作社。他说，巩固工作是多方面的，中心一环是保证合作社不断增加生产和保证社员不断增加收入。
    关于保证合作社增加生产方面，他指出：（一）要每个农业生产合作社，根据全国农业发展纲要中所提出的各项增产措施，并且结合自己的具体情况，抓住其中增产的主要关键，大力进行，贯彻到底，防止生产上的一般化。（二）在保证粮棉增产的同时，要因地制宜地注意发展和农业相结合的多种经营，如林业、牧业、渔业、园艺业、运输业、家畜家禽饲养业、手工业及其他副业生产。在农业中粮食作物和其他经济作物生产，也应该适当安排。他说，目前某些合作社生产单一化的倾向如不改变，结果将可能造成合作社增产而不增值，这对合作社本身是不利的。另一方面，对整个国民经济的平衡也是不利的，有些经济作物和副业产品的减少，往往牵涉到社会生产、生活的各方面。因此在目前农村的经济改组中必须采取慎重态度，凡是当地原来习惯经营而又经营有利的经济作物和副业生产，必须由合作社或鼓励社员继续经营并加以发展，决不可胡乱改组。（三）要做好合作社的经营管理工作。合作社如果没有具体的劳动分工、没有明确的生产责任制和定额管理制度，就必然要产生混乱现象。因此，合作社必须做好固定生产队、固定耕作区、固定耕牛农具等工作，必须制定劳动定额、实行按件计酬或包工包产，超额提奖等制度。（四）根据目前一般干部的管理能力，合作社的领导机构，一般以两级制为好，即社的管理委员会为一级，田间生产队或副业组为一级。几千户以上大社可以考虑三级制，但层次太多，会增加领导上的困难，因此社的规模也不宜太大，山区一、二百户，平原三、五百户比较适宜。社组成后要稳定若干年，不可年年并社。（五）要十分注意推广先进经验，这是推进生产、发挥广大群众积极性创造性和教育群众的最重要方法。所谓先进经验，应该包括生产技术和经营管理等方面。为此，农业生产方面的先进生产者会议，合作社的代表会议和训练班、展览会等都应该定期举行。
    在保证社员增加收入方面，邓子恢指出：（一）要认识这是一个重大的政策问题。分配问题是生产关系的重要方面，分配得合理可以促进生产的发展，分配不合理也会影响到生产不发展，影响到社员和干部的关系、影响到社员和社员的关系，甚至影响到合作社的巩固。因此必须使所有干部在思想上十分重视这个工作，保证社员每年收入有所增加。（二）要贯彻执行中央指示的勤俭办社的方针，力求增加生产，减少开支，克服铺张浪费。一切非生产性开支如卫生、体育、文化、娱乐等费用，以及抚恤救济补助费等必须控制在公益金所能负担的范围之内。当年没有收入的长期基本建设必须照顾现实需要，分清轻重缓急，量力而行，不可有“百废俱兴”“一步登天”的思想。（三）各地要规定一定比例，来限制各种支出和公共积累，譬如当年生产费用一般可以规定不超过当年总收入的15％到20％，脱离生产和半脱离生产干部的工分补贴不超过全社总劳动日数的2％，公积金公益金提成一般不超过净收入的8％，总之要求做到合作社的总收入，扣除了上述各项开支和公粮负担以后，还有60％到70％归社员分配，这样来争取90％的社员都能增加收入。（四）为了保证社员增加收入，还必须建立社内的集体领导，遇事相商而又分工负责的民主集中制，必须开展批评和自我批评，建立无记名投票的选举制度，确立财务管理制度，反对贪污浪费，防止和克服命令主义。
    邓子恢在讲话中，还谈到了工人和其他城市人民有关的问题。他说这个问题就是那些家住城市的劳动人民，他们留在乡村的私有土地如何处理的问题。他认为这种土地可以交给合作社使用，将来他们回乡住居的时候，可以随时加入合作社，如果自己不愿意入社，仍有权领得一份土地自己经营。其中家庭贫苦历来靠取得土地报酬帮助解决生活困难的人，合作社仍将采取必要办法加以照顾。
    邓子恢在讲话中最后特别提到希望参加这次会议的国营农场、牧场、拖拉机站、抽水机站、水利工程部门、森林工业部门、国营造林部门，以及气象台站等先进生产者代表，能够更加加强同当地合作社的联系，用自己的先进经验和先进精神来帮助农民办好合作社。希望中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军从各方面来支持、鼓舞农民办好合作社，希望广大的复员回乡的转业军人参加到合作社中来，起先锋和骨干作用。
