    Pingxiang Anyuan Coal Mine Resumes Coal Production
    Xinhua News Agency: The first pair of new mine shafts in the Anyuan Coal Mine reconstruction project, a famous coking coal production area, in Pingxiang, were officially handed over for production on the 3rd. The Anyuan Coal Mine, which had been abandoned for seventeen years, is now producing coal again.
    Sun Xifu, chief engineer of Anyuan Coal Mine, told Xinhua News Agency reporters that these new mine shafts would normally have been handed over for production in October of this year according to ordinary construction speeds. Because the mine construction workers promoted more than ten advanced experiences in the construction process, such as deep-hole blasting, one-time tunnel formation, and rapid shed erection, and adopted some important rationalization proposals from the old miners of Anyuan Coal Mine, the construction period was greatly shortened. After inspection and verification by relevant departments, the project quality is also very good.
    In addition to the pair of mine shafts that have already been handed over for production, the important projects for the revitalization of Anyuan Coal Mine also include the restoration of the Bafang Well, the main mine shaft for producing coking coal during the Hanyeping Company era, and the construction of a new modern vertical shaft and ventilation shaft. These projects are now all under full-scale construction. By the end of 1957, when these projects are all completed, Anyuan Coal Mine will become the main mining area for Pingxiang Mining Bureau to produce coking coal.

    萍乡安源煤矿重新产煤
    著名炼焦煤产地——萍乡安源煤矿复兴工程中的第一对新矿井，已经在三日正式移交生产。被废弃了十七年的安源煤矿，现在又重新产出了煤炭。
    安源煤矿总工程师孙熙富对新华社记者说，这对新矿井按照普通的建设速度，要到今年十月才能移交生产。由于建井工人们在建井过程中推广了深孔爆破、一次成巷、快速架棚等十多种先进经验，并且采纳了安源煤矿老矿工们的一些重要的合理化建议，使工期大大缩短。经过有关部门验收证明，工程质量也很好。
    复兴安源煤矿的重要工程，除已经移交生产的这对矿井以外，还有恢复汉冶萍公司时代生产炼焦煤的主要矿井——八方井，新建一个现代化的直井和通风井等工程。这些工程现在都已经全面动工。到1957年年底，这些工程全部完工以后，安源煤矿就将成为萍乡矿务局生产炼焦煤的主要矿区。  （新华社）
