    Chongqing Local Industry Launches Product Quality Improvement Campaign
    Taiyuan Factories See Emergence of Many Advanced Producers Guaranteeing Quality
    A product quality improvement campaign has been widely launched in Chongqing's locally-run state-owned factories.

    During the campaign, factory workers are actively putting forward rationalization proposals to improve product quality. Workers in the melting workshop of the Beibei Glass Factory have already put forward forty-seven rationalization proposals to improve product quality, ten of which are of significant value for improving quality. In the past, more than half of the small measuring cylinders produced by Melting Group 1 had uneven bottoms and unclean joints; now, products with these defects account for only 5%. Technicians and workers at the jointly-owned Huafeng Battery Factory collaborated to modify the formula for dry-cell batteries, so that the capacity and current of the batteries exceed the specified quality indicators, and the discharge time has increased from 450 minutes to 550 minutes.

    The vast majority of factories have held quality exhibitions, comparing the products of advanced enterprises with their own similar products, identifying shortcomings in the quality of their own products, and making plans to improve product quality. (Chuan Yu)
    
    In the advanced producer campaign, units such as the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, Shanxi Machinery Factory, Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Factory have already seen the emergence of many advanced production groups and advanced producers guaranteeing quality.

    These advanced groups and advanced producers guaranteeing quality have promoted many advanced experiences in the socialist competition. After the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory launched the "five comparisons" competition (comparing output, quality, etc.), more than 800 workers in the factory are now continuously guaranteeing quality. Many workers at the Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory have eliminated rework and scrapping. The Zhang Shuzhi casting group of the Shanxi Machinery Factory not only completed the quality indicators for normal products, but also achieved 100% qualification when trial-producing more than seventy large pieces of new products.

    Workers at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Factory are also constantly improving the qualification rate of their products. The Ji Minxiu group of the electric furnace steelmaking department, which was awarded the title of "Quality Expert," has not produced any defective products for nine months. (Xinhua News Agency)

    重庆地方工业展开产品质量优良运动
    太原市一批工厂涌现许多保证质量的先进生产者
    产品质量优良运动已经在重庆市地方国营各工厂广泛展开。
    各厂职工在运动中积极提出改进产品质量的合理化建议。地方国营北碚玻璃厂熔化车间职工已经提出四十七件改进产品质量的合理化建议，其中十件对提高质量有重大价值。熔化一组过去生产的小量筒有一半以上装底不平，接合部分不光洁，现在有这种毛病的产品只占5％了。公私合营华丰电池厂技术员和工人合作，修改了手电池的配方，使电池的容量和电流都超过了规定的质量指标，放电时间从过去的四百五十分钟增加到五百五十分钟。
    绝大部分工厂都举办了质量展览会，把先进企业的产品和本厂同类产品进行对比，找出本厂产品质量方面的毛病，作出了提高产品质量的规划。　（川渝）
    太原矿山机器厂、山西机器厂、太原机车车辆修理厂、太原钢铁厂等单位在先进生产者运动中，已经出现了很多保证质量的先进生产小组和先进生产者。
    这些保证质量的先进小组和先进生产者，在社会主义竞赛中，推广了许多先进经验。太原矿山机器厂展开了比产量、比质量等五比竞赛以后，现在，全厂连续保证质量的工人已经有八百多人。太原机车车辆修理厂的许多工人已经消灭了返工报废现象。山西机器厂张树枝铸工小组不仅完成了正常产品的质量指标，并且在试制新产品的七十多个大件的时候，做到了件件合格。
    太原钢铁厂的工人们也在不断地提高产品的合格率。获得“质量能手”称号的电炉炼钢部冀敏秀小组，已经有九个月没有出废品。（新华社）
