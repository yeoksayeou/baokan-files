Guangzhou Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 16th: Guangdong Province has completed its spring plowing on schedule, and the quality of the spring rice transplanting is also very good. According to statistics from various regions on the 16th, nearly 34 million mu of rice fields across the province have been transplanted. The spring plowing area has expanded by 1.34 million mu compared to last year. This year, the transplanting work in various parts of Guangdong has generally started ten to fifteen days earlier than last year. Chao'an County, the nation's first "high-yield rice county," has basically eliminated drought due to the comprehensive construction of water conservancy projects, and completed all transplanting two days before the Grain Rain solar term. In most counties in the northern region, where large-scale sowing usually didn't begin until the Qingming Festival, this year they entered the busy stage of transplanting at the same time.

During the spring plowing, various regions have carried out large-scale reforms in cultivation techniques. Across the province, 80% of the rice fields adopted the small-cluster close planting method, and single or double-plant close planting methods. In the Pearl River Delta's sandy fields, known as "Guangdong's Granary," the area of rice fields converted from double-cropping intercropping to double-cropping continuous cropping increased from 720,000 mu last year to 2 million mu this year.

Currently, the rice seedlings throughout the province are growing very well, and the early-transplanted rice has already flowered and is beginning to form ears. Farmers are earnestly strengthening field management.

    广东省按时完成春耕
    本报广州16日电　广东省的春耕已经按时完成，春耕插秧的质量也很好。据十六日各地的统计，全省已有近三千四百万亩水稻插下了秧。春耕的面积比去年扩大了134万亩。今年广东各地的插秧工作一般都比去年提早十天到十五天。全国第一个“水稻丰产县”潮安县，由于全面兴修了水利，基本上消灭了旱灾，在谷雨节前两天就全部插秧完毕。北部地区的大部分县，往年要到清明节才大量播种，今年在同一时期就进入插秧大忙阶段。
    在春耕中，各地都大规模地进行了耕作技术的改革。全省采用小科密植法、单株或双株密植法插秧的稻田达到80％。号称“广东粮仓”的珠江三角洲沙田地区，去年有七十二万亩水稻田由双季间作改为双季连作，今年已增加到二百万亩。
    目前全省的禾苗都生长得很好，早插的水稻则已经扬花吐穗，农民正在切实加强田间管理。
