Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 1st. Indian Prime Minister Nehru presented a new proposal regarding the Indian government's industrial policy to the People's House on April 30th.

The proposal stated that, to achieve the goals stipulated by the guiding principles of national policy, it is necessary to accelerate the pace of economic development and industrialization, especially developing heavy industry and machine manufacturing, expanding public ownership, and establishing large and growing cooperative elements.

The proposal said that all this provides an economic foundation for increasing beneficial employment opportunities and improving the living standards and working conditions of the masses. Similarly, it is also urgently necessary to reduce the income and wealth inequality that exists today to prevent private monopolies and the concentration of economic power in the hands of a few. Therefore, the state will gradually assume the primary and direct responsibility for establishing new industrial enterprises and developing transportation equipment. It will increasingly engage in state-run trade on a large scale.

The proposal stated that industries are divided into three categories according to the size of the role played by the state. The first category includes industries whose future development will be entirely the responsibility of the state, including heavy industry, especially the arms industry, the atomic energy industry, the steel industry, the power generation industry, coal and oil, and the mining of some non-ferrous metals. The second category includes industries that will gradually be state-owned. In these industries, new enterprises will generally be established by the state, but private enterprises are also expected to supplement the state's efforts. The second category of industries includes other mining industries besides the first category, excluding those classified as minor minerals. It also includes the machine tool manufacturing industry and certain chemical industries. The third category includes the remaining industries. The future development of these industries will generally be undertaken and operated by private capital.

The proposal said that industrial enterprises in the private sector must comply with the scope of the state's social and economic policies and will be subject to the supervision and management of the Industrial (Development and Management) Act and other relevant laws. However, the Indian government recognizes that, in general, it is appropriate to allow such enterprises to develop as freely as possible in accordance with the targets and objectives of the national plan. When private and public units exist simultaneously in the same industry, the state's policy will continue to give both fair and non-discriminatory treatment.

The proposal also stated that the state's policy of supporting rural and small-scale industries will continue. However, its aim will be to focus on measures aimed at improving the competitive strength of small-scale producers.

The new industrial policy also emphasizes the need to cultivate qualified management and technical personnel in public utilities. The conditions of workers should be improved and their efficiency levels raised. Wherever possible, power should be decentralized, and the management of state-owned enterprises should be conducted in accordance with commercial guidelines.

### 尼赫鲁提出加速印度工业化提案  发展重工业，扩大公有成分，建立合作成分

　　尼赫鲁提出加速印度工业化提案
    发展重工业，扩大公有成分，建立合作成分
    新华社新德里1日电　印度总理尼赫鲁四月三十日在人民院提出了一项关于印度政府工业政策的新的提案。
    提案说，为了实现国家政策的指导原则所规定的目标，必须加快经济发展的速度和加速工业化，特别是发展工业中的重工业和机器制造业，扩大公有成分和建立大的和日益发展的合作成分。
    提案说，这一切为增加有益的就业机会和改善人民群众的生活水平和劳动条件提供了经济基础。同样，减少今天存在的收入和财富的不均以防止私人垄断和防止各方面的经济力量集中于少数人的手中也是迫切需要的。因此，国家将逐渐地负起建立新工业企业和发展运输设备的主要的和直接的责任。它将越来越大规模地进行国营贸易。
    提案说，根据国家在其中所起的作用的大小把工业分成三类。第一类是将来的发展将完全由国家负责的工业，这一类包括重工业，特别是军火工业、原子能工业、钢铁工业、发电工业、煤和石油以及一些有色金属的开采业等。第二类是将逐渐地为国家所有的工业，在这种工业中，一般地将由国家来兴办新企业，但是在这种工业中也希望私人经营来补充国家的努力。第二类工业包括了第一类以外的其他采矿业，列入次要矿物类的除外。此外还包括工作母机制造工业和若干化学工业等。第三类工业是其余的工业。这类工业的将来的发展一般的由私人资本兴办和经营。
    提案说，私人部分中的工业企业必须要符合于国家的社会和经济政策的范围，并且将受工业（发展和管理）法以及其他有关的法律的监督和管理。然而，印度政府承认，一般说来，让这种企业按照国家计划的指标和目标尽可能地自由发展是适宜的。当在同一个工业中同时存在着私营和公营的单位时，国家的政策将继续给它们两者以公正的和没有歧视的待遇。
    提案还说，国家支持乡村的和小规模工业的政策将继续下去。但是，它的目的将是集中注意以改善小规模生产者的竞争力量为目的的措施。
    新的工业政策还强调需要在公用事业中培养合格的管理和技术干部。应当改善工人的条件和提高他们的效率水平。只要可能，权力应当分散，国家企业的管理应当依照商业方针来进行。
