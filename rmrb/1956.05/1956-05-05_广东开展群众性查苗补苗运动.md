The broad masses of peasants in Guangdong Province are seizing the opportunity presented by recent rains to continue transplanting rice seedlings and are launching a mass campaign to inspect and replenish seedlings in already transplanted paddy fields.

In the previous period, due to the impact of drought, field inspections in areas such as Shantou and Huiyang revealed that there was generally a seedling deficiency of 5% to 7% in transplanted rice fields, with some reaching 20%. To ensure full seedling establishment, the Chao-Shan Plain and the Pearl River Delta, which are the main rice-growing areas, are now implementing inspections of seedling deficiencies, weeds, drainage and irrigation, and pests by township and by cooperative, promoting farmers to do a good job in field management. In Taishan and Xinhui counties, the seedlings transplanted earliest in eighteen townships have all undergone inspection and replenishment, ensuring full seedling establishment. Some areas have also mobilized farmers to support each other and adjust surpluses and shortages to solve the problem of insufficient seedlings for replenishment.

    广东开展群众性查苗补苗运动
    广东省广大农民正在抓紧雨后时机，继续抢插稻秧；并在已经插秧的稻田上开展群众性的查苗补苗运动。
    前一个时期，由于旱患影响，据汕头、惠阳等地进行田间检查，发现在已插的稻田中，一般缺苗5％至7％，有的达20％。为了保证全苗，目前在主要栽培水稻的潮汕平原和珠江三角洲普遍按乡、按社实行查缺苗、查杂草、查排灌和查虫害，推动农民做好田间管理工作。台山、新会县有十八个乡最早插下的秧，经过检查后，现在全部已进行过查苗补苗，做到全苗。有的地区还发动农民互相支援，互相调剂来解决补苗中秧苗的不足。
