    Dust Collector to Prevent Silicosis
    In the past, miners performing "drilling" operations underground were prone to contracting silicosis due to the abundance of rock dust particles. Recently, the Fushun Coal Mine successfully trial-produced a dust collector that can prevent this disease.
    This dust collector was designed by Ren Tai, an industrial hygiene physician at the Fushun Mining Bureau's Health Department, with reference to the Soviet Uspensky-Type 5 compressed air dust collector. Tests have shown that this dust collector can reduce the number of rock dust particles in each milliliter of air from 3,750 to 150. This dust collector has a simple structure, low cost, and is easy to operate, making it suitable for use in general coal mining areas. The Fushun Coal Mine will soon be promoting this dust collector comprehensively.

    防止矽肺病的捕尘器
    矿工们过去在坑下进行“打眼”作业，由于岩粉颗粒多，容易染上矽肺病，最近抚顺煤矿试制成功一种捕尘器，可以防止这种矽肺病的发生。
    这种捕尘器是抚顺矿务局卫生处工业卫生医师任太参考苏联乌斯波恩——五型压缩空气捕尘器设计的。经过试验，这种捕尘器可以使每粍升空气中3，750个岩粉颗粒减少到150个。这种捕尘器构造简单，成本低廉，操作容易，一般采煤场子里都可以采用。抚顺煤矿即将全面推广这种捕尘器。
