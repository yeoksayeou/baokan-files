    The "Doctor" Who Treats Ailing Railway Lines
    By Our Reporter Zhu Bo
    Li Zhentian is a sixty-four-year-old railway worker, currently a foreman with the Third Engineering Division of the Ministry of Railways Tunnel Company. He is unlike other foremen. Other foremen are responsible for the construction tasks of a project, but he is responsible for handling all the engineering ailments of the engineering division. Therefore, he is praised as the "doctor" who treats ailing railway lines.
    Like all tunnel workers, Li Zhentian can tell the changes in the geological strata by looking with his eyes, and he can tell whether there will be problems with the tunnel's "supports" by listening with his ears. When working on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, he once went to Tunnel No. 1 to inspect the work and saw the workers erecting "supports." He leaned against a pillar that had been erected, watching the workers work. Two workers hammered a pillar a few times and then went to erect another one.
    "Don't be so quick, this pillar hasn't taken the load yet," Li Zhentian said.
    The two workers were unconvinced and said, "You haven't even checked, how can you know the 'support' hasn't taken the load?"
    Li Zhentian did not argue with them, but smiled and walked over, pushing the pillar askew. The two workers ran over in embarrassment and re-erected the pillar. According to Li Zhentian, it's very simple: when the pillar you are leaning against feels like it's sinking, it means the new pillar has taken the load. If there is no such feeling, it means the pillar has not been erected properly.
    When building the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, he was taking a break at the privately-owned Zhonghua Company. Years of labor had made it a habit for him to wander around the construction site. One day, he passed Tunnel No. 22 and noticed that the entrance was about to collapse. He quickly told the workers who were excavating the tunnel, "You guys stop working immediately." The workers were surprised, and someone asked him, "Why stop working!"
    "It's dangerous, this place is going to collapse!"
    "You're just afraid of dying. If you're afraid of dying, stay away," a young worker said. "Don't mind him, keep working."
    The old man was worried and angry, so he ran to find their foreman. When the foreman arrived, he called the workers away. Less than five minutes after the workers left, stones collapsed at the tunnel entrance. The workers were so frightened that their faces turned white. They surrounded Li Zhentian, held his hand tightly, and their eyes were filled with tears of gratitude.
    Afterwards, someone asked him how he knew Tunnel No. 22 was going to collapse. He explained: it's very simple, in the rock layers above the tunnel entrance, there is a "red mud flow" that is the same color as red coke soil. This "red mud flow" gradually weathers when exposed to air, losing its original strength. When it turns the color of yellow soil, it is completely weathered and there is a risk of collapse at any time.
    The Baoji-Chengdu Railway has more tunnels and bridges than any other railway in our country. Inspectors can only walk on temporary trestle roads and steep mountain slopes. When Li Zhentian first came to work on the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the leadership was worried that his body could not take it, and persuaded him to travel less. He smiled and said, "Don't worry about me, I have been friends with the mountains and rocks for decades."
    On the nearly ten kilometers of railway line, regardless of day or night, regardless of wind or rain, he ran from tunnel to tunnel, inspecting the quality of the tunnel engineering, and preventing and dealing with collapse accidents.
    In April 1955, he transferred from another tunnel to Tunnel No. 11 to inspect the work. On the mountain above Tunnel No. 11, he found a crack one centimeter wide. He thought this crack might have existed before, but it might also have been caused by the excavation of the tunnel. In any case, this crack aroused his vigilance. He placed a row of stones next to the crack as a marker.
    Early the next morning, he ran to the mountain above Tunnel No. 11 again to measure it. The crack was already two or three centimeters wide and ran all the way down the mountain. He thought, it would be terrible if this place collapsed. Half of the mountain has three or four thousand cubic meters of stone, and the mountain is full of stones the size of thirty or forty cubic meters. If we don't find a way to rescue it, it will cause the biggest collapse accident on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway.
    He ran down the mountain and into Tunnel No. 11 to inspect it. As soon as he entered the tunnel, he heard the supports creaking loudly. He hurriedly said to the workers who were working, "The supports are creaking like this, why haven't you stopped working!"
    "Which tunnel's supports don't creak? If we stop working when we hear a creak, then all the tunnels won't be excavated," one worker said.
    The old man was very angry, but he couldn't blame the workers because they had no experience. He told them, "The supports are supposed to creak, but the sound of the creaks is different. A 'creak, creak' sound means the supports are taking the load and there is no danger. The current sound is 'creak, crack', which means the supports' load-bearing capacity is not enough and there is a danger of collapse." He then explained the situation he had seen on the mountain.
    At this time, Foreman Miao arrived. The two of them carefully inspected the supports and found that some of the supports had been pressed down four or five centimeters. They decided to stop excavating immediately and ask the leadership for a solution.
    The representatives of the three bureaus (short for the Basic Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, the Sixth Engineering Bureau, and the Northwest Design Bureau) were shocked when they heard about this situation. They all rushed to the scene and invited Engineer Dai Tongsan of the Railway Inspection Institute. After their inspection, they all agreed that the situation in Tunnel No. 11 was very serious and they must find a way to deal with it as soon as possible. Otherwise, if it collapsed, it would not only affect the tunnel project, but also affect the stone arch bridge project outside the tunnel entrance, affecting the completion of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway's entire line.
    But how to deal with it? This is not a small piece of stone that can be moved away at once, but several thousand cubic meters of stone.
    Everyone looked at each other, unable to think of a solution. At this time, someone suggested slope brushing, which means removing half of the mountain. Many people thought this method was better, because continuing to excavate would be dangerous at any moment. Everyone looked at the representatives of the three bureaus, and the representatives of the three bureaus looked at Engineer Dai Tongsan. But Engineer Dai couldn't make a decision either. He looked at Li Zhentian. He had worked with Li Zhentian on the Tianlan Railway and knew that Li Zhentian was an expert in dealing with ailments.
    "Old Li, what do you think we should do?"
    "I haven't thought it through yet," Li Zhentian was thinking about this problem, "But, I don't agree with slope brushing, we can only brush the slope when it is absolutely necessary. Look, half of the mountain has three or four thousand cubic meters of stone. How much manpower and money would it take to move it away? Besides, this is not only a tunnel, but also this arch bridge. If we brush the slope, the arch bridge project will also have to stop construction, which will have a great impact on the entire Baoji-Chengdu Railway project."
    "Then what should we do?" Many people asked in unison.
    The old man's eyes suddenly lit up and he said firmly, "Dig, continue excavating!"
    Many people thought it was impossible, and some even thought the old man was simply confused. They said: if you continue excavating, you might as well say you want it to collapse. For every few people who go in, a few will have to be carried out.
    The old man looked at them, did not refute, and continued, "My meaning is to dig from the inside out."
    Some workers heard that they were going to dig from the inside out, and they also disagreed. Some people said: Old man, you're confused, how can you dig from the inside out? Isn't that just asking for trouble? If you dig from the outside, you can run out if you see something bad.
    The old man explained: "It's more dangerous to dig from the outside. The exit of the tunnel is a deep valley, and there is nowhere to run when it collapses. Besides, there are many large hills on the mountain. Even on flat ground, you can't avoid them. It's less dangerous to dig from the inside out."
    Engineer Dai Tongsan asked Li Zhentian to explain the method in detail.
    "My meaning is to first strengthen the roots from the inside (strengthen all the supports). After the roots are strengthened, we won't be afraid of collapse," Li Zhentian talked about his ideas in detail. "We have to bring several days of food in, and we also have to have a steel pipe going in. In case of a collapse, we won't starve, and we can also use the steel pipe to transmit things and messages."
    This method was adopted.
    At this time, Li Zhentian's younger brother sent an urgent telegram, saying that his father was seriously ill and the old man wanted to see him one last time... This telegram brought him great pain. He wanted to go back and see the old man, but he thought that the problem of Tunnel No. 11 was so serious. If he went home, who would solve the problem here? Thinking of this, he quietly stuffed the telegram into his pocket and continued to study the method of excavating from the inside out.
    He was the first to go in. The workers followed him in.
    He observed the inside of the tunnel very carefully, carefully checked the supports' ability to withstand the pressure of the mountain rocks, and the changes in the rocky mountain.
    The workers saw Li Zhentian's calmness, and they followed him in with confidence. However, everyone was very nervous, especially when they heard the supports creaking or a small piece of rock falling from their heads, making people feel that the tunnel could collapse at any time. Seeing this situation, Li Zhentian observed the situation of the tunnel while mobilizing the workers, and always directed the workers to replace the damaged supports with new ones. Until he thought everything was in order, he said: "Let's do it, we have strengthened the roots, we are not afraid of the sky falling."
    The workers were all specifically divided into tasks, and it was proposed that the workers must be in sync when working. The workers who were excavating would dig past, and the workers responsible for the supports would immediately erect the supports, and each worker was required to be fast and steady.
    In the rescue of the Tunnel No. 11 project, Li Zhentian did not leave the tunnel for five or six consecutive days. Sometimes, he would go back to the dormitory to rest, but as soon as he lay down, he would put on his clothes and run to Tunnel No. 11 to continue working with the workers. In this way, he persisted until the Tunnel No. 11 project was completed.
    This Communist Party member, who made many contributions to the construction of the Northwest New Line, also participated in cultural classes after coming to the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. After more than a year of hard study, he was able to read newspapers and technical books such as the Soviet Dantuolov's "Tunnel". He said, "After reading these technical books, I feel more capable. In the past, I only relied on my own experience, but now, when I compare my past experience with the books, many problems become clearer."

    给线路治病的“医生”
    本报记者　朱波
    李振田是一个六十四岁的铁路工人，现在，是铁道部隧道公司第三工程处的一个领工员。他这个领工员跟别的领工员不同。别的领工员负责一项工程的施工任务，他却负责处理工程处所有的工程上的病害。所以，被人誉为给线路治病的“医生”。
    李振田像所有隧道工人那样，凭眼睛可以看出地层变化的情况，靠耳朵可以听出隧道里的“支架”会不会发生问题。在兰新路上工作的时候，有一次，他到一号隧道去检查工作，看到工人们正在竖“支架”。他背靠着一根打好的柱子，看着工人们工作。有两个工人把一根竖起来的柱子打了几下就去竖另一根柱子。
    “先不要忙，这个柱子还没有吃上劲哩。”李振田说。
    那两个工人听了很不服气地说：“你没有检查，怎么能够知道‘支架’没有吃上劲呢？”
    李振田没有同他们争论，笑着走过去，一推就把柱子推歪了。那两个工人不好意思地跑过来，又重新把柱子立上去。据李振田说这很简单，当你的背靠着的柱子有下沉的感觉的时候，就是说新的柱子已经吃上劲了。如果没有这种感觉，就是说柱子没有打好。
    在修建天（水）兰（州）铁路的时候，他正在私营中华公司住闲。多年劳动的习惯，使他经常在工地上转来转去。有一天，他路过二十二号隧道，发现洞口要塌方，就忙告诉正在开挖隧道的工人们说：“你们几个赶快停工。”工人很奇怪，有人就反问他说：“为什么要停工！”
    “有危险，这个地方要塌方！”
    “就是你怕死，你怕死就躲得远远的。”有一个年青的工人说：“不要管他，赶快工作。”
    老人又耽心又生气，就跑去找他们的领工员。领工员来了，才把这几个工人叫开。工人离开不到五分钟，隧道口上石块就塌下来了。把几个工人吓得脸都变成了白色。他们围住了李振田，紧紧地握住了他的手，每个人的眼睛里都含着感激的眼泪。
    事后有人问他怎么知道二十二号隧道要塌方。他解释说：这很简单，在洞口上边的石层里有一种和红焦土同样颜色的“红泥流”，这种“红泥流”一遇到空气，就要渐渐地风化，失去了它原来的力量，等到它变成黄土的颜色，就是全部风化了，随时随地有塌方的危险。
    宝成铁路的隧道和桥梁之多，是我国其它铁路所没有的。检查工作人员只能在临时修建的栈道上和险峻的山坡上行走。李振田刚来宝成路北段工作的时候，领导上怕他身体吃不消，就劝他少跑路。他却笑着说：“不要替我耽心，我和山石已经交了几十年的朋友了。”
    他在近十多公里的线路上，不管白天黑夜，不管刮风下雨，从这个隧道跑到那个隧道，检查隧道工程的质量，并且防止和处理塌方事故。
    1955年4月里，他从别的隧道转到十一号隧道来检查工作。在十一号隧道的山头上，他发现有一条一公分宽的裂缝。他想这个裂缝可能是原来就有的，但是也可能是因为开挖隧道而产生的。不管怎样，这个裂缝引起了他的警惕。他给裂缝摆了一排石子作为记号。
    第二天一早，他又跑到十一号隧道山头上量一下，裂缝已经有二、三公分宽，并且一直通下山去。他想，这个地方要塌下来可真不得了，半个山头足有三、四千立方石头，而且山上都是三、四十立方大小的石块，如果不想法抢救，就会造成宝成路上最大的塌方事故。
    他就连忙跑下山来，钻到十一号隧道里去检查。他一进隧道，就听到支架“咯叭咯叭”地直响。他急忙对正在工作的工人说：“支架已经响到这种情况，怎么还不停工！”
    “那个隧道里的支架不响呢，听见响就停工，所有的隧道就不要开挖了。”一个工人说。
    老头听了当然很生气，他又不能怪工人，因为他们没有经验。他告诉他们说：“支架是要响，但是响的声音不同，“咯吱咯吱”的响声是说明支架正在吃劲，没有危险；现在的响声是“咯叭咯叭”的，说明支架承重力不够了，就要发生危险。”他接着又把在山上看到的情况说了说。
    正在这个时候，苗领工员来了。他们两人又详细检查了支架的情况，发现有的支架已经被压下去四、五公分。他们决定立即停止开挖，请示领导上想办法解决。
    三个局（铁道部基本建设局、第六工程局、西北设计局的简称）的代表听到这个情况，都大吃一惊。他们都赶到现场来了，并且还请来了铁道检查所的戴统三工程师。经过他们检查之后，都认为十一号隧道的情况很严重，必须设法早动手处理，不然，如果塌下来，不仅影响隧道工程，而且还影响隧道进口外边的石拱桥工程，影响完成宝成铁路全线通车的任务。
    但是如何处理呢？这不是一小块石头，一下就可以搬走，而是几千方石头。
    大家都是你看我；我看你的，想不出办法。这时有人提出来要刷坡，就是把这半个山搬走。很多人认为这个方法比较好，因为继续开挖时时刻刻都有塌方危险。大家都看着三局的代表，三局的代表又看着戴统三工程师。但是戴工程师也下不了决心。他看着李振田，他在天兰路上和李振田一起工作过，知道李振田是处理病害的能手。
    “老李，你看怎么办？”
    “我还没有想好”，李振田正在想这个问题，“不过，我不同意刷坡，除了不得已的时候才能刷坡。你看看吧，半座山足有三、四千立方石头，要用多少人工和金钱才能把它搬走。再说，这不仅是隧道，还有这座拱桥，如果刷坡，拱桥工程也要停止施工，这对整个宝成路工程影响太大了。”
    “那怎么办呢？”很多人都不约而同地问。
    老头的眼睛忽然亮了一下，坚决地说：“挖，继续开挖！”
    很多人都认为不行，甚至有的人认为老头简直是糊涂了。他们说：继续开挖，你还不如说要它塌方哩。保险进去几个就得抬出几个来。
    老头看了看他们，没有反驳，就继续说：“我的意思是从里向外挖。”
    有些工人听说从里边向外挖，也都表示不同意。有的人说：老头，你糊涂了，怎么能从里往外挖呢？那不是找着一锅熟吗？如果从外边挖，看见事不好还可以跑出来。
    老头解释说：“从外边挖危险更大，出洞口就是深谷，塌方的时候没有地方跑，再说山上有很多大山头，就是平地也躲不开；从里朝外挖，危险性还小一点。”
    戴统三工程师要求李振田把这个办法具体地说一说。
    “我的意思是，先从里生根（把支架都进行加固），生根后就不怕塌方了。”李振田把他想的办法详细地谈了一下。“我们进去要带几天的粮食，还要有一条钢管通进去，万一塌方，也不致于挨饿，又可以通过钢管传递东西和消息。”
    这个办法被采纳了。
    就在这时候，李振田的弟弟打来了一份加急电报，说他的父亲病得很严重，老人家想要见他一面……这份电报给他带来极大的痛苦，他想回去和老人见一面，但是，又想到十一号隧道的问题这么严重，如果回家去，这里的事情谁去解决呢？想到这里，他就悄悄地把电报塞进了裤袋里，继续研究从里向外开挖的办法。
    他第一个进去。工人们也随着他进去了。
    他非常细心地观察隧道内部的情况，仔细检查支架承受山石压力的情况和岩山变化的情况。
    工人们看到李振田这样的沉着，他们也都放心大胆地跟随着他走进去。但是，大家心情都非常紧张，特别是当他们听到支架“咯叭咯叭”的响声，或者有一小块岩石从头上掉下来的时候，使人感到隧道随时都有塌下来的可能。李振田看到这种情况，就一边观察隧道的情况，一边对工人进行动员，并且随时指挥工人把那些压坏了的支架，都换成了新的。直到他认为一切都收拾好了，才说：“干吧，我们生根了，天塌下来也不怕了。”
    工人们都具体地分了工，并且提出工人在工作的时候，步调一定要一致，开挖的工人挖过去，负责支架的工人，立即把支架竖起来，而且要求每个工人的动作要快、要稳。
    在抢救十一号隧道工程中，李振田一连五、六天不离开隧道。有时候，他回宿舍去休息一下，但是刚刚躺下，随着又披上衣服，跑到十一号隧道去，继续和工人们一起坚持工作。就这样，他一直坚持到十一号隧道工程完工。
    这个在西北新线建设中立了很多功的共产党员，来宝成路之后，还参加文化班学习。经过一年多的苦学，他能够阅读报纸了，并且能够阅读苏联丹都洛夫的“隧道”等技术书籍。他说：“读了这些技术书，感到自己更有办法了，过去只凭自己经验过的一些事，现在把过去的经验和书本一对照，很多问题就更加明确了”。
