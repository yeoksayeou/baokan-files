　　Soviet Union Widely Researches the Use of Solar Energy
    Xinhua News Agency Correspondent in Moscow, Li Nan
    Like scholars in other countries around the world, Soviet scholars regard the issue of utilizing solar energy as a practical and promising research endeavor. Not long ago, many reports in Soviet newspapers discussed the achievements of Soviet scholars in this area, attracting the attention of a wide readership.
    According to scholars' estimates, the heat energy that the sun radiates onto the earth in ten days is equal to the total known energy of all coal reserves on earth. In the southern regions of the Soviet Union, around noon, each square meter of area receives energy from the sun equivalent to about one horsepower per hour. How to "capture" more solar heat energy has long been the ideal of many scholars, but the science of truly researching the utilization of solar energy has only emerged in the last ten years or so.
    In the Soviet Union, research on the utilization of solar energy is concentrated in the Solar Technology Laboratory of the Institute of Power Engineering of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union. The head of this laboratory, Dr. Baum, once said that they had completed the design of a solar power station, which was mainly designed for the southern regions such as Central Asia and Armenia, where there are no less than two hundred sunny days a year. Recently, it was reported that the Institute of Power Engineering has completed the blueprint for a solar power station. This power station has a generating capacity of about 1,200 kilowatts and can produce about eleven tons of steam per hour. In addition to power generation, it can also be used for heating in winter. It seems that the appearance of solar power stations is not far away.
    In the Soviet Union, the utilization of solar energy is not only a matter for scientific research departments, but also a task with broad public interest. Many engineers, designers, and amateur scientists have made more or less contributions in this area, designing many devices that utilize solar energy in various ways. These devices are not complicated, and judging from many trial runs, they have achieved good results.
    A large amount of hot water can be obtained from a simple device using the heat of solar radiation. This device, called a "solar water heater," has several different manufacturing methods. Technical Associate Dr. Petukhov designed a water pipe type of water heater, which can heat seven hundred liters of water to about 50 degrees Celsius on a sunny day. By using many sets of solar water heaters, sufficient hot water can be obtained for bathrooms, laundries, etc. In Tashkent, Tbilisi, and other places, there are about one hundred such "solar bathrooms." Near Ashgabat, a "solar bathroom" installed many years ago, which is still in use, can serve 350 people a day. A bathroom installed in a factory in the Bryansk Oblast can be used continuously for seven months a year. Machine tractor stations, collective farms, sanatoriums, and factories can build such devices on their own with little effort.
    In the city of Almaty and within the Republic of Uzbekistan, individual physicians have designed special reflecting devices to use solar energy to treat skin diseases such as cutaneous tuberculosis. It is said that in Almaty, such devices have existed for many years, are convenient to use, and have good results, having cured many patients.
    The Soviet Union has built small boilers that use solar heat. In 1953, a small cold storage facility was built on a trial basis in Tashkent, using steam from a "solar boiler." This small cold storage facility can produce 250 kilograms of ice per day.
    "Solar water heaters" do not require reflecting devices. If reflectors are used, even higher temperatures can be obtained. The "household solar cooker" is the simplest type with reflectors. In 1955, the Karakum scientific research team used this type of solar cooker while working in the desert areas. The capacity of the solar cooker is about equal to that of a 500-watt electric stove, which can cook meals for four or five people and boil five liters of water per hour. The Soviet Union has now designed more than one type of "solar cooker," including those that can be folded into a suitcase for travel and those that can be used by ordinary households. These devices that widely utilize solar energy in daily life, after certain modifications, can also be used in industrial and agricultural production, such as in greenhouses and threshing grounds.
    These Soviet devices for utilizing solar heat energy have not yet been produced in factories and have not received the due attention of some relevant departments. However, since last year, many departments have decided to promote these devices.
    The application of semiconductors has opened up a more convenient and promising path for the utilization of solar energy. The Institute of Power Engineering of the Academy of Sciences recently completed the experimental work on a solar thermoelectric generator, using semiconductor materials to directly convert solar heat energy into electricity. This experiment was very successful, and the solar cell generated 40 watts of electricity. This institute plans to continue researching the use of semiconductors to produce solar thermoelectric generators with even stronger power during the Sixth Five-Year Plan. Solar energy can make electric lights shine and can also provide power to radios. It can be predicted that in the future, solar energy will become one of the most convenient sources of electricity.

### 苏联广泛研究利用太阳能

　　苏联广泛研究利用太阳能
    新华社驻莫斯科记者　李楠
    像世界其他各国的学者一样，苏联的学者们也把利用太阳能的问题当作一桩富有实际意义和远大前途的研究工作。不久以前，苏联报刊上的许多报道谈到了苏联学者们在这方面的成就，引起了广大读者的注意。
    据学者们的推测，太阳照射到地球上十天内的热能就等于现在已经知道的地球蕴藏的全部煤的能量。在苏联的南部地区，在接近正午的时候，每一平方公尺的地区在一小时内从太阳接受的能量大约等于一匹马力。如何“捕捉”到更多的太阳的热能，在很久以前就是许多学者们的理想，但是，真正研究利用太阳能的科学还是最近十多年来才出现的事情。
    苏联利用太阳能的研究工作集中在苏联科学院动力研究所的日光技术实验室里面。这个实验室的负责人技术博士鲍姆曾经说，他们已经完成了日光电力站的设计工作，这种电力站主要是为了中亚细亚、亚美尼亚等南部地区设计的，那里每年阳光灿烂的天气不下两百天。最近，又有报道说，动力研究所已经绘制好了一个日光电力站的蓝图。这个电力站约有一千二百瓩的发电能力，每小时可以产生十一吨左右的蒸汽，除了供发电用以外，还可以在冬天供取暖之用。看来，日光电力站出现的时间已经不远了。
    在苏联，利用太阳能还不只是科学研究部门的事情，而且也是一件具有广泛群众兴趣的工作。不少的工程师、设计师、业余科学家都或多或少地在这方面作出了贡献，设计出了许多从多方面利用太阳能的装置。这些装置并不复杂，并且从许多试用情况看来，都得到了良好的效果。
    利用太阳照射的热力可以从一种简便的装置得到大量的热水。这种被称为“太阳热水箱”的装置有好几种不同的制造方法。技术副博士佩图霍夫设计了一种水管式的热水箱，如果在有太阳的晴天，可以将七百公升的水加热到摄氏五十度左右。利用许多组太阳热水箱就可以获得足够的热水供浴室、洗衣房等使用。在塔什干、第比利斯等地，这样的“太阳浴室”一共有约一百座。在阿什巴哈附近，一座多年前装置的、至今还在使用的“太阳浴室”，每天可以供三百五十人使用。在布利安斯克州一家工厂里装置的一座浴室，一年内可以连续利用七个月。机器拖拉机站、集体农庄、疗养院、工厂都可以用自己的力量不太费力地修造这样的装置。
    在阿拉木图城和乌兹别克共和国境内，都有个别的医师设计出专门的反射装置，利用太阳能来治疗例如皮肤结核这样的皮肤病。据说，在阿拉木图，多年以前就已经有了这样的装置，用起来很方便，效果也很好，曾经治好许多患病的人。
    苏联已经建造了利用太阳热力的小型锅炉。1953年，在塔什干曾经试建了一个小型冷藏库，利用的是从“太阳能锅炉”内来的蒸汽。这个小型冷藏库每天可以制造二百五十公斤冰。
    “太阳热水箱”是不需要反射装置的。如果带着反射器，还可以得到更高的温度。“家用太阳灶”就是带着反射器的最简便的一种。1955年，卡拉库姆的科学研究工作队就带着这种太阳灶在沙漠地带工作。太阳灶的能力大约等于五百瓦的电炉，可以烧四、五个人吃的饭，每小时可以烧开水五公升。苏联现在设计出来的“太阳灶”不止一种，有可以折合成手提箱一般供旅行之用的，也有可以供一般家庭用的。这些在生活上广泛利用太阳能的装置，经过一定的改造，也可以在工业和农业生产上使用，例如在暖室和打谷场上使用。
    苏联的这些利用太阳热能的装置还没有在工厂内生产，还没有得到若干有关主管部门的应有的重视。不过，从去年起已经有许多部门决定推广这些装置。
    半导体的应用给利用太阳能开辟了更加便利和远大的道路。科学院动力研究所在不久以前完成了太阳热电发生器的试验工作，应用半导体物质把太阳的热能直接变成电力。这次试验很成功，太阳电池发出的电力是四十瓦特。这个研究所准备在第六个五年计划内继续研究运用半导体制出电力更强的太阳热电发生器。太阳能电力可以使电灯发亮，也可以供给收音机以电源。可以这样预料，在将来，太阳能将成为使用最方便的电力泉源之一。
