In Yunnan Province, 1.52 million illiterate people in rural areas have enrolled in school, exceeding the original plan by 40%. Qujing County carried out literacy work while developing water conservancy projects. The peasants have a high enthusiasm for learning. Illiterate people who started learning in February can now record work points. More than 70 townships in Mouding County have established people's schools and literacy associations, ensuring that every mountainous township and every village in the plains has a people's school. They flexibly arrange study time according to the changes in the agricultural seasons. In the Gui Mountain area of ​​Lunan County, the Sani people of Suoyishan Township run people's schools in advanced cooperatives and cultural classes in production teams. They have adopted the method of "contract teaching and guaranteed learning," so that 95% of the students can persist in their studies. Now, the average student can write two or three hundred characters from memory.

    云南农村扫盲工作迅速发展
    云南省农村入学的文盲已有152万人，超过原来规划的40％。曲靖县在开展兴修水利工作中同时开展了扫盲工作。农民学习情绪很高，从二月开始学习的文盲，现在都能记工分了。牟定县已有七十多个乡成立了民校，扫盲协会，作到了山区乡乡有民校，平坝区村村有民校。随着农业节季的变化，他们灵活地安排了学习时间。路南县圭山区蓑衣山乡撒尼族农民把民校办在高级社里，文化班办在生产队里。他们采取了包教保学的方法，使95％的学员都能坚持学习，现在一般学员都能默写二、三百字。
