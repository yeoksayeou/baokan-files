The Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Region in Yunnan Province has been changed to an autonomous prefecture in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. From April 25th to May 1st, the autonomous prefecture held its first session of the first People's Congress. A delegation headed by Zhang Chong, Vice Governor of Yunnan Province, and including representatives from the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, the Honghe Hani Autonomous Region, the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Region, and other minority areas, attended the meeting to offer congratulations. Zhang Chong delivered an important speech to the conference on behalf of the Provincial People's Committee, and representatives from various fraternal ethnic minority areas also delivered congratulatory messages to the conference.
　　Dao Jingban, Chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Government, gave a report to the conference on the work of the Autonomous Region over the past two years and more, and the tasks for the future. He said: Over the past two years, the face of the Autonomous Region has undergone fundamental changes. All ethnic groups have closely united around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The historical estrangement between the Han and minority ethnic groups, and between the Dai and Jingpo ethnic groups, has been basically eliminated. At the end of last year, in the Dai areas and other ethnic areas with the same social and economic structure as the Dai people, land reform was completed through peaceful consultation, meeting the land requirements of poor farmers. By early April this year, 371 agricultural production cooperatives had been established throughout the region, with the number of households joining the cooperatives accounting for more than 10% of the total number of households in the region. There has also been great development in agricultural production throughout the region. Grain crops in 1955 increased by 24% compared with 1952 before the establishment of the Autonomous Region. The region has also planned and vigorously cultivated subtropical cash crops such as coffee, kapok, and tea, greatly improving the lives of all ethnic groups.
　　The conference elected Dao Jingban (Dai) as the Governor of the Autonomous Prefecture, and also elected fourteen vice governors and twenty-eight members of the Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee.
　　There were 519 representatives of all ethnic groups attending the conference. They discussed and approved the government work report and the overall plan for the Autonomous Prefecture from 1956 to 1962 proposed by Zheng Gang, Secretary of the Dehong Autonomous Prefecture Committee of the Communist Party of China, on behalf of the Party Committee.

    自治区人民政府主席刀京版向大会作了自治区成立两年多来的工作情况和今后工作任务的报告。他说：两年多以来，自治区面貌已发生根本变化，各民族已亲密团结在中国共产党和毛主席周围，汉族和少数民族、傣族和景颇族之间历史上遗留下来的隔阂已基本上消除。去年年底，在傣族地区和社会经济结构与傣族相同的其他民族地区，运用和平协商的方式，完成了土地改革工作，满足了贫苦农民的土地要求。到今年四月上旬，全区建成了371个农业生产合作社，入社农户已占全区总农户的10％以上。全区农业生产也有很大发展，粮食作物1955年比自治区成立前的1952年增产24％，全区还有计划地大力种植了咖啡、木棉、茶等亚热带经济作物，各族人民的生活因而获得很大改善。
    大会选出了刀京版（傣）为自治州州长，并选出副州长十四人和自治州人民委员会委员二十八人。
    出席大会的各族代表有519人，他们讨论并通过了政府工作报告和中共德宏自治州委书记郑刚代表党委提出的自治州从1956年到1962年的全面规划。　（据新华社讯）
