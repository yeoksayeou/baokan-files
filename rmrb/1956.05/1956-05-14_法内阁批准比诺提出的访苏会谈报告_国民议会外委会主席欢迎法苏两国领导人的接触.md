Xinhua News Agency, May 13th dispatch from Paris: The French Cabinet met on the 12th and approved the report made by Foreign Minister Pineau. In his report, Pineau put forward specific opinions on many issues to be discussed during the upcoming French-Soviet talks.

The French Cabinet spokesman said: Mollet and Pineau will discuss all issues related to the two countries with the Soviet representatives. Mollet is scheduled to return to France on May 21, and Pineau will stay in the Soviet Union for a few more days.

Mollet and Pineau are scheduled to go to the Soviet Union on May 15. During Mollet's absence, Minister Guy Mollet will act as Prime Minister.

Xinhua News Agency, May 12th dispatch from TASS, Paris: The Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French National Assembly, Mayer, told a “Pravda” reporter in Paris regarding the upcoming visit of Prime Minister Mollet and Foreign Minister Pineau to Moscow that state leaders' visits to foreign countries always achieve positive results, because such visits almost without exception help to eliminate misunderstandings and lack of understanding on many issues.

Mayer welcomed the recent visits abroad by Soviet leaders several times and hoped that such visits would increase. He also pointed out the significance of Soviet travelers, students, and ordinary people visiting non-communist countries.

Mayer then pointed out that it is particularly gratifying that the atmosphere is favorable when the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister are about to visit Moscow. Now everyone realizes that the Cold War is "useless" and it is necessary to try to find ways for two economic systems to coexist, allowing the broad masses of the people to choose between these two systems.

Mayer finally expressed unconditional welcome to the contact between the leaders of France and the Soviet Union. He said that as a socialist, he sees more reasons to be full of hope from this upcoming visit.

    法内阁批准比诺提出的访苏会谈报告
    国民议会外委会主席欢迎法苏两国领导人的接触
    新华社13日讯　巴黎消息：法国内阁在十二日开会，批准外交部长比诺所作的报告。比诺在报告里提出了对就要举行的法苏会谈将讨论的许多问题的具体意见。
    法国内阁发言人说：摩勒和比诺将同苏联代表讨论同两国有关的一切问题。摩勒预定在五月二十一日返回法国，比诺将在苏联多逗留几天。
    摩勒和比诺已定在五月十五日去苏联。在摩勒离职期间，不管部长孟戴斯—弗朗斯将代理总理职务。
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社巴黎十二日讯：法国国民议会外交委员会主席麦耶就总理摩勒和外交部长比诺即将访问莫斯科一事对“真理报”驻巴黎记者发表谈话说，国家领导人访问外国总是能取得积极结果的，因为这种访问差不多没有例外地有助于消除在许多问题上的误会和不了解。
    麦耶对苏联领导人最近几次到国外访问表示欢迎，并且希望这种访问会多起来。他还指出苏联旅行家、学生和普通人访问非共产主义国家的意义。
    麦耶接着指出，特别令人满意的是法国总理和外交部长要访问莫斯科的时候的气氛。现在每一个人都意识到冷战是“无益的”，必需尝试找寻两种经济制度共处的途径，而让广大人民群众在这两种制度中加以选择。
    麦耶最后对法苏两国领导人的接触表示无条件的欢迎。他说，作为一个社会党人，他从这次即将进行的访问中看到更多的令人满怀希望的理由。
