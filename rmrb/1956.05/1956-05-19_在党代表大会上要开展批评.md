Criticism Should Be Carried Out at Party Congresses

    Don't Be Afraid of Criticism
    One of the purposes of convening a Party Congress is to fully develop democracy, use collective strength to examine and summarize work, and study and solve major problems in work. However, some members of the CCP Zhenyuan County Committee of Guizhou Province and the presidium of the Zhenyuan County Party Congress, before the congress even started criticism, were afraid that the representatives would "criticize wrongly," that it would lead to "unclear right and wrong," and demanded that the representatives "connect with themselves" and "share responsibility" when discussing the work report of the previous county committee. Hearing such "mobilization," the representatives naturally became apprehensive, thinking that this congress was a "rectification campaign." Thus, some representatives only examined their own shortcomings and errors in their speeches, and dared not offer criticism to the leadership. In the speeches of some representatives, as soon as they touched on the shortcomings of the leadership's work, they quickly added, "It's not the fault of the leadership, mainly because our level is not high enough to understand the intentions of the higher authorities." Some representatives only talked about past shortcomings and not about problems in the current work. The presidium of the congress discovered this problem, held a meeting to discuss it, and decided to eliminate everyone's concerns and let go to develop democracy. The original county party secretary also made a self-criticism to the congress on behalf of the county committee for the shortcomings and errors in the leadership's work. The representatives launched sharp and realistic criticism of the county committee's work. The representatives criticized the county committee's single-handed work method: only paying attention to agricultural production, and not paying attention to the arrangement of rural sideline occupations, commerce, and handicrafts, which affected the lives of the masses. The representatives also revealed that in some places, because the technical leadership work could not keep up with the needs, new agricultural implements became exhibits, and water conservancy projects became waste products. While criticizing the county committee, the representatives also consciously examined the problems in their own work and thinking. Those county committee members and presidium members who were afraid of making mistakes and creating chaos, felt that they had received a profound education at this time, re-evaluated their "mass viewpoint," and requested the congress to continue to develop democracy and carry out criticism.

    Correct Opinions Must Be Insisted Upon
    At the first congress of the Huaibei Salt Field of the CCP, such an intolerable thing happened: a portion of the former party committee members, controlling the congress presidium, did not allow the delegation of directly affiliated organs of the salt field to speak at the congress, on the grounds that the delegation's criticism of the leadership would produce a bad influence. Why were these party committee members particularly afraid of the criticism from the delegation of directly affiliated organs? At the industrial conference convened by the provincial party committee in March of this year, a secretary of a general branch of the salt field reported some problems in the work of the party committee. Liu Dong, a member of the salt field party committee, was extremely dissatisfied with this approach of the general branch secretary, and threatened: "You criticize the party committee as worthless; those things, you are not allowed to say them after you return." Later, when the secretary of the salt field party committee was drafting the work report of the party committee to the Party Congress, he wrote some shortcomings in the work of the party committee. Liu Dong asked him to erase them. The delegation of directly affiliated organs knew these situations very clearly and exposed them at the congress. This angered the party committee secretary Ye Zhijun and Liu Dong, who unreasonably cancelled the right to speak of the delegation of directly affiliated organs. This could not scare people. The delegation of directly affiliated organs did the right thing. They held two delegation meetings in succession, insisting on the right to speak, and pointed out the seriousness of the former party committee members' error of suppressing criticism. The presidium of the congress also realized the seriousness of the problem and decided to extend the speaking time of the congress, so that everyone could express their opinions at the congress as much as possible, and fully carry out criticism and self-criticism. In this way, the number of people speaking at the congress increased from fourteen to twenty-nine. This not only helped the former party committee to recognize their shortcomings and errors, but also educated all the representatives, so that the congress achieved very good results.

    It Won't Be "Chaotic"
    Before the Party Congress was convened, some people in the former county party committee of Yiwu County, Zhejiang Province, were afraid that fully developing democracy would "mess up" the congress. Thus, after the congress began, when the representatives were about to discuss the work report of the former county party committee, some people emphasized to the representatives: "It is necessary to affirm achievements," "pay attention to the correctness of criticism," "representatives' speeches at the congress should focus on self-criticism," and so on. As a result, as these people hoped, the representatives talked more about the achievements in the work, and less about the shortcomings and errors in the work, especially the leadership's work. Later, after repeated mobilization by the presidium of the congress, criticism and self-criticism began to unfold. In their speeches, many representatives not only criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking of the county committee in leading agricultural collectivization; but also made pointed criticisms of the members of the county committee who had committed serious errors. For example, they criticized Sun Fangshan, the former member of the county party committee and deputy minister of the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Department, for his commandism style and his abusive behavior towards his wife. They criticized Han Tao, the former member of the county party committee and deputy minister of finance and trade, for his bureaucracy, and the former member of the county party committee and deputy minister of the organization department for his complacency. Those who were criticized made self-criticisms at the congress. When electing the county committee members, the representatives' enthusiasm was very high. When passing the candidates, according to the opinions of the majority of representatives, three county committee member candidates and one discipline inspection committee member candidate were replaced, so that the county committee members and representatives to the provincial Party Congress elected by the congress were all unanimously supported by the vast majority of representatives.

    在党代表大会上要开展批评
    不要害怕批评
    召开党的代表大会的目的之一是要充分发扬民主，运用集体的力量来检查和总结工作，研究和解决工作中的重大问题。可是，中共贵州镇远县委员会以及镇远县党代表大会主席团的有些成员，在大会还没有展开批评以前，就怕代表们“批评错了”，怕弄得“是非不清”，要求代表们在讨论前届县委的工作报告的时候要“联系自己”，要“分担责任”。代表们听了这样的“动员”，自然就有了顾虑，以为这次代表大会是一次“整党”。于是，有的代表在发言中就只检查自己的缺点和错误，不敢向领导方面提出批评。有的代表的发言中，一涉及到领导工作的缺点，就赶忙补充一句“怪不得领导，主要是我们的水平不高，不能领会上级的意图”。有的代表只讲过去的缺点，不讲目前工作中的问题。大会主席团发现了这个问题，召开会议作了讨论，决定消除大家顾虑，放手发扬民主。原县委书记也代表县委会向大会检讨了领导工作的缺点和错误。代表们对于县委的工作展开了尖锐的实事求是的批评。代表们批判了县委单打一的工作方法：只注意农业生产，不注意对农村副业、商业和手工业的安排，以致影响了群众生活。代表们还揭发了有些地方因为技术领导工作赶不上需要，以致新农具变成了展览品，水利工程成了废品。代表们在批评县委的同时，也都自觉地检查了自己工作和思想中的问题。那些怕错怕乱的县委委员和主席团成员，这时候才都感到受了一次深刻的教育”，都重新估价了自己的“群众观点”，要求大会继续发扬民主，开展批评。
    正确的意见要坚持
    在中共淮北盐场第一次代表大会上，发生了这样一件令人不能容忍的事情：一部分前届党委委员把持着大会主席团，不许盐场直属机关代表团在大会上发言，理由是这个代表团对领导进行批评，会产生不好的影响。这些党委委员为什么特别害怕直属机关代表团的批评呢？在今年三月间省委召开的工业会议上，盐场的一位总支书记汇报了党委工作中的一些问题。盐场党委委员刘冬对于总支书记的这种作法极为不满，并且威胁说：“你们把党委批评得一钱不值；那些事情，回去以后不准说。”后来，盐场党委秘书在起草党委向党代表大会作的工作报告的时候，把党委工作中的一些缺点写了进去。刘冬又让他抹掉。直属机关代表团对这些情况知道得很清楚，并且在代表大会上作了揭发。这就激怒了党委书记叶志俊和刘冬，竟然无理地取消了直属机关代表团的发言权。这是吓不住人的。直属机关代表团作得很对。他们连续开了两次代表团会议，坚持要求发言，并且指出前届党委委员的这种压制批评的错误的严重性。代表大会主席团也认识到问题的严重性，决定延长大会发言时间，让大家尽量地在大会上发表意见，充分地开展批评和自我批评。这样，在大会上发言的人就由十四人增加到二十九人。这不仅帮助前届党委认识了自己的缺点和错误，而且教育了所有的代表，使大会收到了很好的效果。
    “乱”不了
    在召开党代表大会以前，浙江省义乌县前届县委中就有人怕充分发扬了民主、会把大会“搞乱”。于是，大会开始以后，在代表们要讨论前县委工作报告的时候，就有人在代表面前强调说明：“要肯定成绩”、“要注意批评的正确性”、“代表在大会上发言应该以自我批评为主”等等。结果正如这些人所希望的，代表们对于工作中的成就谈得多，对于工作特别是领导工作中的缺点、错误谈得少。以后，经过大会主席团的反复动员，批评和自我批评才展开起来。许多代表在发言中，不仅批评了县委在领导农业合作化中的右倾保守思想；而且对县委中犯有严重错误的委员，也作了指名的批评。例如批评了原县委委员，互助合作部副部长孙芳山的强迫命令作风和他虐待妻子的错误行为。批评了原县委委员、财贸部副部长韩涛的官僚主义和原县委委员、组织部副部长的骄傲自满情绪。受批评的人都在大会上做了检讨。选举县委委员的时候，代表情绪十分热烈。在通过候选人的时候，依照多数代表的意见，调换了三个县委委员候选人和一个监委委员候选人，这样使大会选出的县委委员和出席省党代表大会代表，都是绝大多数代表一致拥护的人。
