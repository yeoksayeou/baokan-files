To the Editor:

    Some industrial and mining enterprises and commercial departments do not execute the contracts they have signed, causing undue losses to other units.

    The Shandong Shidao Huanghai Shipyard began producing motorized sailing boats in the second quarter of this year and signed a contract with the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory for the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory to supply forty-two diesel engines in the second quarter. By late April, the wooden hulls of some ships had been built, but they could not be installed because the engines had not arrived. The Huanghai Shipyard contacted the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory several times and sent people to urge them, but the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory said that it could not deliver the goods on time and could only deliver twenty-two engines in May and June. This not only prevents the Huanghai Shipyard from completing the state plan on time, but also affects the spring fishing season for fishermen.

    The timber used by the Yixin Match Factory of Changwei Industrial Company is supplied by the Tonghe Forestry Industry Administration. In February and March of this year, eighty-six cubic meters of timber were not delivered according to the contract. As a result, the sawing workshop of the Yixin Match Factory had to stop work and wait for materials, and production suffered undue losses.

    The local state-owned wineries in the Jining area have always had their baijiu purchased by the Monopoly Affairs Company. Recently, because the Monopoly Affairs Company failed to purchase according to the contract, the wineries were forced to stop production because they had no place to store their products. The Tengxian Winery alone lost more than 13,000 yuan due to stopping production for four days.

    Signing a contract is a serious matter. It should be carefully considered before signing, and it should be carefully executed after signing. The practice of signing contracts casually and not executing them properly should be criticized.

    订了合同就应该执行编辑同志：
    有些工矿企业和商业部门不执行自己所签订的合同，以致使其他单位受到了不应有的损失。
    山东石岛黄海修船厂从今年第二季度开始生产机帆船，并且同上海柴油机厂签订了合同，由上海柴油机厂在第二季度供应柴油机四十二台。四月下旬，一部分船只的木壳已经造好了，因为机器没有到厂，不能安装。黄海修船厂几次同上海柴油机厂联系，并且派人去催问，但是上海柴油机厂说是不能如期交货，只能在五、六月间交二十二台机器。这不仅使黄海修船厂不能按期完成国家计划，而且也影响了渔民的春汛生产。
    昌潍实业公司益新火柴厂所用的木材是由通河森林工业管理局供应的。在今年二、三月份，就有八十六立方公尺的木材没有按合同交货。因此，益新火柴厂锯工车间只好停工待料，生产受到了不应有的损失。
    济宁专区的四个地方国营酒厂生产的白酒，一直是由专卖事业公司收购的。最近由于专卖事业公司不按照合同规定收购，使酒厂因为产品没有地方存放而被迫停工。仅滕县酒厂停止生产四天，损失就达一万三千多元。
    签订合同，是件严肃的事。在签订以前应该慎重考虑，在签订以后就要认真执行。随意签订合同又不好好执行的做法应该受到批评。
