    Unite Well, Make Good Steel
    Cao Ming

    Metallurgical engineers know what raw materials and methods to use to make steel; the great Russian writer Nikolai Ostrovsky can tell us how steel-like will is forged; and the workers of the No. 8 open-hearth furnace at the Anshan Iron and Steel Works deeply understand that to make good steel, one must have a spirit of collectivism and do a good job of unity.

    The No. 8 open-hearth furnace is a banner of the steel plant, and its excellent performance has been maintained for a long time. The achievements it has created are not the result of smooth sailing or easy gains, but the result of the efforts of many people and many struggles.

    In 1949, when the No. 8 open-hearth furnace resumed production, the three steelworkers (originally called technicians, later called furnace chiefs) assigned to lead the production of the third shift were Ding Xueke, Gu Baoshan, and Xie Yupu. They were the oldest workers in the factory. Although they had worked in the factory for more than ten years, the Japanese never taught them steelmaking techniques, only asked them to sweep the platform and throw ore. Once, the Japanese saw that Gu Baoshan was clever and, fearing that he would learn steelmaking, quickly transferred him to another department. Ding Xueke and him had only learned steelmaking for a few days after the Japanese left. Now that these three old partners were transferred to one furnace, it was such an exciting thing for them. Although Xie Yupu came a few days later, he became bolder with the two old partners together.

    "Hey, guys, think about the past, the Japanese wouldn't even let us get close to the furnace door; but now, the Party has given us such a big open-hearth furnace, we should think of ways to make more steel." Ding Xueke said, looking at his two partners.

    Gu Baoshan recalled the uncomfortable feeling when the Japanese transferred him away from the open-hearth furnace, and spat in hatred; Xie Yupu also recalled that when the Kuomintang came, he could not maintain his life and was forced to sell hemp ropes on the street to survive. ... In this way, the three old partners led everyone to make steel wholeheartedly, and the rest of the workers were very happy to learn steelmaking from these two people who were more experienced in the whole factory. The three of them were old workers with higher awareness and prestige in various work sections; they were also willing to help other furnaces deal with some problems. Therefore, the impression of this No. 8 open-hearth furnace was a bit unusual.

    However, steelmaking is a continuous production and a collective production, which requires extremely close cooperation between the three shifts and between the open-hearth furnace and various work sections. If a certain individual or department does not cooperate well or is irresponsible, the result will be either the furnace body is damaged, or the quality of the steel is not good, and the smelting time is extended. At that time, although the technical level was very low, neither shortening the smelting time nor high quality was required, but everyone could see the damaged furnace roof. Although these three old partners chatted and laughed after get off work, and were as close as brothers, they still argued fiercely when it came to arguing. Xie Yupu complained to Ding Xueke, "The furnace roof should be damaged by you, don't think you've been making steel for a few years." Gu Baoshan also had opinions when he saw that Xie Yupu's shift did not remove the slag when it was about to connect to the open-hearth furnace. The Party branch secretary called them together and said, "You three are old workmates, Party members, and furnace chiefs. If you are not united, how can the workers of the three shifts be united? This is a national steelmaking open-hearth furnace, not a pot of rice you cook at home. Even if you cook a pot of rice, burning it will affect the whole family." The three looked at each other, and then rushed to make self-criticisms. The branch secretary was satisfied, but reminded them, "If you have opinions, you should raise them, but you must find a way to solve them, not just murmur behind your back." From then on, the three of them would open up whenever they had opinions. They still argued and quarreled, but they had to find the cause and discuss solutions. Criticism and self-criticism became active in the No. 8 open-hearth furnace; they were even more dedicated to technical research. Therefore, this furnace had better production, better labor organization, and faster problem-solving. Everyone envied and said, "Look how united the three shifts of the No. 8 open-hearth furnace are." "Look how fast their shift handover is." "People work efficiently." ...

    With the development of production, the old steelworkers were promoted one after another, and the first assistants of each shift, Dang Deling, Chen Xiaofa, and Cui Yongjiu, were successively appointed as steelworkers. Due to the suggestions of Soviet experts, the three pre-refining furnaces were rebuilt into open-hearth furnaces, and production took a big step forward. The third batch of steelworkers had been replaced by Wang Rongliang, Wang Changxin, and Wang Zhenjia. Thanks to the care of the Party and the efforts of the workers, the advantages of the No. 8 open-hearth furnace were basically maintained. The fourth batch of steelworker, Jin Fuchen, was particularly humble and hardworking. He not only united well with Liu Baoyu and Li Jingquan, but also united well with the workers of the charging machine and raw material work sections. If two open-hearth furnaces used charging cars at the same time and could not stagger, Jin Fuchen would often let others use them first. When charging cold materials, no one liked large pieces of cold materials, but Jin Fuchen said to the raw material workers, "Okay, you load it, no one else uses it, isn't that wasting national property?"

    Once, the second assistant of the third shift did not seal the tap hole tightly. When molten iron was poured from above, a stream of molten iron gushed out from the tap hole and solidified, blocking the taphole. But it was almost time to get off work, and the workers wanted to leave it alone. Steelworker Jin Fuchen called the first assistant Li Shaokui and said, "This piece of iron must be chiseled open, otherwise it will cause trouble for the next shift." Li Shaokui smiled and nodded, waved his hand, and the second assistant pushed over the "maliu", and he started chiseling with the workers. When the relieving workers came, they saw them still chiseling the iron block. Although the iron block was chiseled open, it blocked the taphole and was still a hazard. If it were moved away, that semi-red and semi-black hot iron block weighed a full sixty or seventy pounds. Some people wanted to leave, planning to leave the iron block to cool down and let the next shift handle it. Li Shaokui saw a sack next to him and thought, "I have an idea." He took the sack to the cold water tank and soaked it thoroughly, then wrapped the iron block, bent over and hugged it, and with a force, he hugged it out of the taphole. His apron was burned, and his gloves also caught fire. The partners rushed forward to untie his apron and take off his gloves. He neither frowned nor looked bitter, and said with a smile, "Look at my strength, building socialism depends on a good body as capital."

    Looking at him, everyone was moved, not by his "strength," but by his spirit of going through fire and water, sparing no effort to unite everyone and do a good job in production. The worker who took over his shift often complained, but under the influence of Li Shaokui's spirit of creating conditions for the next shift everywhere, he could not remain indifferent.

    In the winter of 1952, Li Shaokui became the steelworker of the third shift of the No. 8 open-hearth furnace. After accepting this position, he was very worried: one was that he had little education and experience; and the other was that many workers in the three shifts were older than him, so how could he do a good job of unity? But when he thought of helping his father farm in his old home in Hebei, where he ate breakfast but had no dinner; and later, when he was a temporary worker in Anshan, he had to hide in Benxi because he beat a bookkeeper who worked for the Japanese, his enthusiasm came. The Party also supported him and asked technicians to help him specifically. He made rapid progress, and soon he could independently handle problems on the furnace. Furnace maintenance technician Leng Yuelin especially praised him, saying, "You are the only one who can help me, it would be great if all the steelworkers were like you." Seeing that the furnace maintenance technician was so hardworking, he asked himself, "Why can't we take good care of the furnace?" But at that time, he didn't know how to protect it.

    Initially, his working method was only one: to endure hardship and be willing to work hard; before handing over the shift, he always led the workers to do everything that could be done for the next shift; when removing slag, he would rather not get off work if he did not remove it thoroughly. Some workers complained to him, "Working for more than ten hours in a row is too tiring, Lao Li. We'll remove it for the next shift, and they may not remove it for us when they're on duty." Li Shaokui encouraged everyone, "If we keep this up for a long time, they will learn from us." One day, the Party committee secretary saw that it was dark, and Li Shaokui and others were still removing slag under the open-hearth furnace, so he asked them, "It's been several hours since the shift ended, why haven't you gone home yet, aren't you tired?" Li Shaokui replied, "We're not tired. What about you, Party committee secretary?" Everyone laughed. The Party committee secretary also smiled and left. The next day, the Party committee secretary called Li Shaokui to the Party committee office and pointed out to him, "I know your spirit is very good, and you don't mind being tired to produce more for the country. But you have to take care of everyone's health. We can't just rely on strength to work, we have to use our brains to think of ways: those things should make everyone think alike, those things should be set up with a system, so that everyone can work according to the system." Li Shaokui thought about the words of the Party committee secretary again and again, ah, the system is easy to set up, but whether people listen to him or not is not up to him? He began to do ideological work. He knew that Wang Shouwen and Wang Enxin had opinions, so he decided to solve this problem first. One day he asked Wang Shouwen, "What do you think of me taking over the shift?" Wang Shouwen immediately replied, "What's there to say!" Li Shaokui then said, "It would be great if you could take over Wang Enxin's shift like this." Wang Shouwen couldn't stand it after hearing this, and immediately retorted, "He, after adding cold materials, he only cares about adding molten iron before it melts well, and he doesn't care about others. He's too unconscious!" Li Shaokui smiled at him like an older brother and said, "Even if he's unconscious, aren't you more conscious than him? Then set an example for him to see. You know, we are both Communist Party members." Wang Shouwen didn't speak, and at this time his silence was better than speaking, because he already knew that he should play a leading role. The next day, Li Shaokui ran to solicit Wang Enxin's opinions on himself, and Wang Enxin said gratefully, "When we're on duty, you've already done everything you can do for us." Li Shaokui shook his head and said, "We prepare for your shift for the sake of the No. 8 open-hearth furnace; you create conditions for Wang Shouwen's shift also for the No. 8 open-hearth furnace; for the No. 8 open-hearth furnace is to produce more for the country. In the future, let's work towards one goal, just raise any opinions, let's hold a three-shift meeting regularly." Later, both steelworkers welcomed this kind of meeting, because through criticism and debate, many opinions could be eliminated in time, and work shortcomings could be corrected in time. Under the guidance of the Party committee, Li Shaokui used organizational forms to consolidate and develop the advantages of the No. 8 open-hearth furnace, so that criticism and self-criticism could play a fighting role. On this basis, the slag removal system and the mutual aid furnace repair system, which were not easy to promote on other furnaces, could be implemented there. Li Shaokui understood that unifying thinking was a primary issue, but after the thinking was unified, it had to be consolidated with a certain system. In the gap between steelmaking, or a few minutes before taking over the shift, he made full use of it to hold a furnace front meeting to explain the tasks of the day clearly, so that everyone understood their responsibilities and the direction of their efforts. For example, when test-smelting seamless steel, he repeatedly explained the experts' instructions to the workers clearly, and also explained the reasons for the failure of other shifts' experiments, so that everyone had full mental preparation and cooperated more closely to avoid repeating mistakes. The first furnace of seamless steel in China was smelted by Li Shaokui's shift under the guidance of expert Zhi Liangke.

    After 1952, with the development of production, the requirements for steelmaking gradually became stricter, and various systems were gradually established, but there were still many difficulties in implementing and learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Implementing operating procedures, maintaining the furnace body well, and implementing team accounting were all first implemented in the No. 8 open-hearth furnace. Many new steel grades were also test-smelted there.

    When "fixing furnace and fixing material" was tried out in the No. 8 open-hearth furnace, it also encountered a lot of ideological resistance. Some people said, "Even if you cook rice with rice, there will be a bowl and a half left, how can the material be so accurate?" "The most conscientious cook will have rice grains in the ditch when washing rice, how can you not waste one or two grains of magnesite?" In response to these problems, the leaders specially organized a forum for open-hearth furnace workers and refractory factory workers, and the female workers introduced their stories of picking magnesite day and night to supply the open-hearth furnace, and they were unwilling to rest even when their fingers were worn out. The open-hearth furnace workers were moved. The No. 8 open-hearth furnace paid special attention to it and discussed it repeatedly. Everyone understood that every member of the entire working class wanted to make outstanding contributions to the people. If anyone did not do their job well, they would be sorry for everyone.

    Maintaining the furnace body well is a difficult task. It not only requires the unity of the three shifts and careful use of it, but also involves technical issues. Working tensely in front of the furnace door at more than 1,000 degrees is inherently difficult, especially in summer. Li Shaokui always led by example and repeatedly told everyone the benefits of diligent observation, diligent inspection, high-temperature furnace repair, diligent shoveling of water jackets, and protecting the taphole. Sometimes Li Shaokui encouraged everyone and said, "No one is afraid of heat, but we love our ideals even more. Let's think about it, in the future, every family will have radios, and their children will be able to go to middle school, how good that kind of life would be; now it doesn't matter if we sweat a little more." Yes, that kind of life is not far away, he introduced to everyone the living conditions of the Soviet workers and collective farm members that he had seen with his own eyes. The red fire shone on his healthy face, which had been tested thousands of times by the raging flames, and his words dispelled people's fatigue. On the issue of combining national interests and personal interests, the workers of the No. 8 open-hearth furnace had a more specific understanding. They all understood that everyone should do their job well, maintain the furnace body well, reduce furnace repair time, and make more steel. As the country's wealth increased, their personal piece-rate wages and bonuses also increased. Their monthly income was always a little more than others. Others envied them very much. Some people also asked strange questions, "People will also have a cold and cough, how come the No. 8 open-hearth furnace is always so stable and evenly producing all year round?" In fact, there is no secret. They are mainly based on the unity of thought, strictly implement operating procedures, and resolutely implement the experts' suggestions. In the past two or three years, the No. 8 open-hearth furnace has not been without fluctuations, but no matter how it fluctuates, they quickly corrected it on the basis of collectivist awareness. Wang Shouwen and Wang Enxin both have a deep understanding of this experience. Last summer, Shan Rongbi, a steelworker from the No. 7 open-hearth furnace, went to ask Wang Shouwen, "Why can't we always complete production? Tell us your secret?" Wang Shouwen asked him, "Do you have any situations where you are rushing work or being irresponsible?" "Isn't that commonplace!" Shan Rongbi replied. Wang Shouwen listened, nodded, and then told him the reason that rushing work causes the smelting time to be prolonged for the next shift, and prolonged smelting time easily damages the furnace lining. Frequent furnace damage results in long repair times, and the steelmaking time is relatively reduced, so the state plan cannot be completed, and there is no extra salary or bonus. "If you don't believe it, go back and try it. Lao Wang and I have both made this mistake, but we quickly understood that this is wrong, the country suffers losses, and individuals have no benefits either." Collectivist thought is great, but it is expressed in people's thousands of small and specific actions.

    After Shan Rongbi went back, he first united everyone ideologically. After more than half a year of efforts, the No. 7 open-hearth furnace is now an advanced furnace.

    In March and April of this year, the workers of the No. 4 open-hearth furnace learned from the experience of the No. 8 open-hearth furnace and strengthened the unity of the three shifts, and also changed from a bad open-hearth furnace to a good open-hearth furnace.

    With the development of the country's industrial construction, Li Shaokui, under the care and guidance of the Party, has made certain contributions to how to lead the production of open-hearth furnace steelmaking. During his tenure, he mainly inherited and creatively developed the advantages of the No. 8 open-hearth furnace.

    The No. 8 open-hearth furnace has not only smelted a lot of high-quality steel for the country, but also cultivated many outstanding cadres for the country; they are adapting to the development of the country's steelmaking industry and are undertaking work in various positions. Among them, three have assumed the responsibilities of shift director and chief furnace maintenance technician after returning from studying in the Soviet Union. Although the outstanding cadres of the No. 8 open-hearth furnace are constantly being transferred away, the excellent traditions and work style of the No. 8 open-hearth furnace can still be consolidated and developed as the country's development requires.

    团结好，炼好钢
    草明
    冶炼的工程技术人员知道用什么原料和方法去炼钢；俄国伟大的作家奥斯特洛夫斯基会告诉我们钢铁的意志是怎样锻炼成的；而鞍钢炼钢厂八号平炉的工人们则深深体会到要炼好钢，就要具备集体主义精神，做好团结工作。
    八号平炉是炼钢厂的一面旗帜，它的优异成绩一直保持了很久了。它所创造的成绩也不是风平浪静或随手得来的，而是经过许多人的努力和不少的斗争得来的。
    1949年，八号平炉恢复生产的时候，被派去八号平炉领导生产的三班的炼钢工（原叫技术员，后又曾叫炉长）是丁学科、顾宝山、谢玉璞三个人。他们是这厂最老的工人，他们虽在厂干了十多年，但是日本人从来不教给他们炼钢技术，只叫他们扫扫平台，投投矿石。有一回日本人看见顾宝山聪明，怕他学会炼钢，赶快调他到别的部门。丁学科和他，都是在日本人走后，才学炼了几天钢。现在这三个老伙计调到一个炉子上，这是多么令他们兴奋的事。谢玉璞虽然晚来几天，但和两个老搭当在一块，胆子也壮起来了。
    “唉，伙计啊，想想过去，日本人连炉门的门洞也不叫咱们挨近；可是现在，党把这大一个平炉交给咱们啦，咱们想点办法多炼点钢才好。”丁学科望着两个伙伴说。
    顾宝山想起过去日本人把他调离平炉时那股难过的滋味，还恨得啐了一口吐沫；谢玉璞也回忆起国民党来时他维持不了生活，逼得上街卖麻绳活命。……就是这样，三个老伙计领着大家一心一意炼钢，其余的工人跟着这两个全厂比较有经验的人学炼钢，真是再高兴也没有了。他们三个是老工人，觉悟也高一些，在各工段中有威信；他们也肯去帮助别的炉子处理一些问题。所以这个八号平炉给人的印象就有点不一般了。
    但是炼钢，是连续性的生产，又是集体性的生产，它要求三班之间，平炉与各工段之间的极紧密的配合。如果某个个人或某部门配合不好，或不负责任，结果不是炉体坏了，就是钢的质量不好，和冶炼时间延长。那时虽然技术水平很低，既不要求缩短熔炼时间，对质量要求也不高，但是化了炉顶，倒是大家看得见的。别看这三个老伙计下了班时唠唠扯扯，亲密得像兄弟一样，但是该吵嘴的时候还是争的面红耳赤。谢玉璞埋怨丁学科说，“炉顶该你化的就是你化的，别看你炼过几年钢哩。”顾宝山看见谢玉璞那一班让炉渣快接上平炉还不打，也就有意见。党支部书记把他们叫在一块，说：“你们三位都是老工友，都是党员，又是炉长，如果你们不团结，叫三班工人怎样团结？这是国家炼钢的平炉呀，不是在你们家里煮的一锅饭。就是煮一锅饭，煮糊了也影响一家人呢。”三个人你望我，我看你，跟着就抢着检讨开了。支部书记满意了，可又提醒他们说：“有意见，要提，但是要想办法解决，不是背后嘀咕就了事。”从此以后，三个人一有意见就摊开来，争还是争，吵还可以吵，但是要找出原因，商量解决的办法。批评和自我批评在八号平炉上活跃起来了；他们对技术更是钻研。所以这个炉子生产比较好，劳动组织也好，解决问题快。大家羡慕地说：“看八号平炉三班多团结。”“看人家交接班多快。”“人家干活就是利爽。”……
    随着生产的发展，老炼钢工先后被提升了，各班的一助手党德令、陈效法、崔永久陆续被任为炼钢工。由于苏联专家的建议，把三个预备精炼炉改建为平炉，生产大大前进一步。第三批炼钢工已换了王荣亮、王长信、王振家三个人。由于党的关怀和工人们的努力，八号平炉的优点基本上保持下来。第四批的炼钢工金福臣特别虚心，任劳任怨，他不仅和刘宝玉、李景泉团结得很好，就是和装料机和原料工段的工人也团结得很好。如果两个平炉同时用装料车，错不开时，金福臣就往往让别人先用。装冷料的时候，谁也不喜欢大块的冷料，金福臣却对原料工人说：“行呀，你装吧，谁也不用它，那不是浪费了国家的财产？”
    有一回，丙班的二助手没把出钢口堵严实，从上面兑铁水时，一股铁水从出钢口冒了出来，并且凝结了，挡住了出钢槽。但是这时快下班了，工人想撩下不管。炼钢工金福臣叫一助手李绍奎说：“这块铁得把它凿开，不啦就给下一班添麻烦。”李绍奎笑着点点头，把手一摆，二助手推过来“马溜”，他便和工人动手凿起来。接班的人来了，看见他们还铿铿锵锵地凿铁块哩。铁块虽然凿开，但挡着出钢槽，终是个害。要是把它搬开，那块半红不黑的热铁，足足有六七十斤。有些人想走了，打算留下铁块等它凉了让下一班去处理。李绍奎看见旁边有一块草袋子，一想，有门啦。他把草袋子拿到冷水槽去浸得透湿，然后包着铁块，俯身一抱，一使劲就把它抱出出钢槽外了。他身上的围裙给烧着了，手套也起火啦。伙伴们抢着上前给他解围裙，摘手套。他既不皱眉，也不苦脸，还在笑嘻嘻地说：“瞅我这股牛劲，建设社会主义得靠一点好身体做本钱。”
    瞅着他，大家感动了，感动的不是他那股“牛劲”，而是他那种赴汤蹈火，不惜一切地团结大家搞好生产的精神。接他班的那个工人常爱发个牢骚的，但在李绍奎处处为下一班创造条件的精神影响下，也不能无动于衷。
    1952年冬天，李绍奎当了八号平炉丙班的炼钢工。接受了这个职务，他愁的了不得：一是文化低、经验少；再说三班工人中比他年头长的很多，怎样做好团结工作呢？可是想到自己在河北老家帮助父亲种地时，吃了早餐没晚餐；后来在鞍山当零工时，因为打了一个给日本做事的账房先生，不能不躲到本溪去的狼狈情形，他的热劲就来了。党又支持他，请技术员具体帮助他。他进步很快，不久，就可以独立处理炉子上的问题。护炉技师冷越林特别称赞他，说：“就数你能帮我点忙，所有的炼钢工都像你那样就好了。”他看见护炉技师那么辛苦，就问自己说：“我们为什么不能好好爱护炉子？”但是那个时候他不懂得如何去保护它。
    最初，他的工作方法只有一个：吃苦在前，任劳任怨；交班以前总是领导工人把能为下班做到的事都做好；打炉渣呢，不打利爽宁肯不下班。有的工人埋怨他说：“连班十多小时，太累啦，老李。我们给下班打，上班不一定给我们打呢。”李绍奎鼓动大伙说：“日子长了，他们就会学咱们的样。”有一天党委书记看见天黑了，李绍奎等还在平炉底下打渣，就问他们说：“下班已经好几个钟头啦，还不回家，你们不累么？”李绍奎回答道：“我们不累。那么你哩，党委书记？”大伙笑了。党委书记也笑了笑，走了。第二天，党委书记把李绍奎叫到党委办公室，指点他说：“我知道你们的精神很好，为了国家多生产也不嫌累。但是你要照顾到大家的健康。我们不能单凭力气干活，还得动脑筋去想办法：那些事该让大家思想一致，那些事该定下制度，大家好按制度办事。”李绍奎把党委书记的话想了又想，啊，制度好订，可是人家听不听还不由他？他开始做思想工作了。他知道王守文和王恩信两个人有意见，便决心先去解决这个问题。有一天他问王守文说：“你对我接班有什么意见呢？”王守文一口就回答说：“那还有什么好说的呢！”李绍奎紧接着说，“假如你接王恩信的班也能这样就好了。”王守文听了有点受不住，马上反驳道：“他呀，加了冷料，没等熔化好就只顾加铁水，也不管人家。他太不自觉啦！”李绍奎像个哥哥似地笑着对他说：“就算他不自觉吧，你不是比他自觉么？那就做个榜样给他看看。你知道，我们两人都是共产党员啊。”王守文不说话了，这时他不说话比说话强，因为他已知道自己应该起带头作用。另一天，李绍奎跑去征求王恩信对自己的意见，王恩信感激地说：“我们上班的时候，你们能为我们做的事都已做到了。”李绍奎摇摇头，说：“我们为你们班预备好，就是为了八号平炉；你们为王守文班创造条件，也是为八号平炉；为八号平炉就是为国家多生产。以后咱们奔一个目标，有意见只管提，定期开三班碰头会吧。”后来这两个炼钢工都很欢迎这种碰头会，因为经过批评和争论，有好多意见能及时消除，工作缺点也能及时纠正。李绍奎在党委的指点下，运用组织形式把八号平炉的优点巩固并发扬了，使批评与自我批评能起到战斗的作用。在这样的基础之上，什么打渣制度啦，互助补炉等制度在别的炉子上不易推行的，在他们那里能够贯彻。李绍奎懂得了统一思想是个首要问题，但是思想一致以后，还得用一定的制度来把它巩固。在炼钢的空隙，或接班前的几分钟，他充分利用它来举行炉前会议，把当天的任务交代清楚，使每个人都懂得自己的责任和努力的方向。如试炼无缝钢时，他反复把专家的指示向工友交代清楚，也把别的班试验失败的原因讲明白，使大家有充分的精神准备，更密切地配合动作，避免重犯错误。中国第一炉无缝钢就是在专家治良科的指导下，由李绍奎班炼成的。
    1952年后，随着生产的发展，对炼钢的要求逐渐严格，各种制度也逐渐建立，但是贯彻和学习苏联先进经验还遇到许多困难。执行操作规程，维护好炉体和贯彻班组核算等，都是首先在八号平炉得到贯彻。许多新钢种的试制，也在那儿试炼。
    “定炉定料”在八号平炉试行时，同样遇到许多思想的抵抗，有人说：“下米做饭都会剩个一碗半碗，配料还能那么准确？”“最有良心的炊食员淘米，水沟里还有米粒呢，怎能不糟蹋一两粒镁砂？”领导人针对这些问题，特意组织了平炉工人和耐火厂工人座谈，女工们介绍她们为了供应平炉需要，夜以继日地挑拣镁砂，手指头磨破还不肯休息的故事。平炉工友感动了。八号平炉特别抓的紧，反复讨论这件事，大家明白整个工人阶级里面的每一个成员都想为人民作出出色的贡献，如果谁不把自己的工作作好，那将会对不起大家。
    维护好炉体，是个艰苦的工作。那里面不仅要三班团结，小心使用它，而且还有技术问题。在一千多度的炉门前紧张地劳动，本来是很艰苦的，特别是夏天。李绍奎总是以身作则，并反复向大家讲勤看、勤检查、高温补炉、勤铲水套、保护好出钢口等好处。有时李绍奎鼓动大家说：“热，是没有人不怕的，但是我们更爱我们的理想。咱们想想看，将来老百姓家家都有收音机，他们的孩子都能念中学，这样的生活该多好；现在咱们多流点汗真不算得什么。”是的，这样的生活并不遥远，他把亲眼看到的苏联工人和集体农庄庄员们的生活情形向大家介绍。红色的火光辉映着他那张千百次受熊熊的烈焰所考验的健康的脸庞，他的话驱散人们的疲劳。在国家利益和个人利益结合的问题上，八号平炉的工友的体会就更具体了。他们都懂得每个人做好自己的工作，维护好炉体，减少修炉时间，多炼钢，国家财富增加了，个人的计件工资和奖金也就增加了。他们每月收入，总是比别人多一些。别人很羡慕他们。也有人发出奇怪的讯问：“人也会有个伤风咳嗽，怎么八号平炉老是那么稳稳当当，一年到头地均衡生产？”其实那也没有什么秘密。他们主要是在思想团结一致的基础上，严格执行操作规程，坚决贯彻专家的建议。这两三年中，八号平炉也不是没有波动的，但不管怎样波动，他们在集体主义的觉悟基础上，很快就纠正过来。这种经验王守文、王恩信都有很深的体会。去年夏天七号平炉炼钢工单荣毕去问王守文道：“为什么我们老完不成生产？把你们的秘密告诉我们吧？”王守文问他道：“你们有没有抢工序，或不负责任的情形？”“那不是家常便饭啦！”单荣毕回答说。王守文听了，点点头，然后把抢工序给下班造成熔炼时间延长，熔炼时间长了容易把炉膛泡坏，炉子常坏，修理时间就长，炼钢时间相对减少，所以国家计划完不成，超额工资和奖金都没有了的道理对他说。“不信，你回去试一试。我和老王都犯过这个毛病，但是我们很快就懂得这是不对的，国家吃亏，个人也没有好处。”集体主义思想是伟大的，但是它表现在人们的千百件细小的具体的行动中。
    单荣毕回去后，首先在思想上团结大家，经过半年多的努力，七号平炉现在已是一个先进的炉子了。
    今年三、四月间，四号平炉的工人们学习了八号平炉的经验，加强三班团结，也由一个不好的平炉变成一个好的平炉。
    随着国家工业建设的发展，如何领导好平炉炼钢的生产，李绍奎在党的关怀和引导下，是做了一定的贡献的。他在职期中，主要是继承并创造性地发展了八号平炉的优点。
    八号平炉不仅给国家炼了许多优质钢，还为国家培养了许多优秀的干部；他们适应着国家炼钢事业的发展而在各种岗位上担负着工作。其中三个在去苏联学习回来后，已担当了值班主任和护炉总技师的职责。八号平炉的优秀干部虽不断的被调走，但八号平炉的优良传统作风还能随着国家的发展需要而巩固和发展着。
