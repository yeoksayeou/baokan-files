    Give Play to the Role of National Agricultural Loans
    Zhu Yukun
    The total target for national agricultural loans issued this year reaches 3 billion yuan. The increase in this single year is more than the accumulated total of agricultural loans in the past five years. Recently, the National Bank allocated an additional 200 million yuan in living grain loans to farmers. The state's financial assistance to farmers this year has increased unprecedentedly.

    With the development of agricultural cooperativization, the lives of farmers have been improving year by year; however, it should still be noted that many farmers still have many difficulties in production and life. At the same time, many agricultural cooperatives have concentrated most of their labor on major agricultural production. Farmers' sideline income in these areas has decreased compared to the past, and some people have experienced difficulties due to a lack of food.

    Under such circumstances, it has become a very urgent task for local national banks to issue loans in a timely and reasonable manner, to help farmers in disaster areas and poor farmers in general areas overcome difficulties in life and production, and to encourage farmers' enthusiasm for production. In the current distribution of loans, local banks should uniformly distribute the recently increased living grain loans and the originally planned living loans. Special care should be given to cooperatives in disaster areas and cooperatives with many poor members. The amount of loans should be determined realistically based on the extent of each household's living difficulties, avoiding equal distribution. In addition, practical assistance should be given to poor individual farmers outside the cooperatives and should not be ignored.

    Correctly grasping the state's policy on issuing agricultural loans is the main key to giving play to the role of loans in increasing agricultural production. When issuing loans to agricultural production cooperatives, the People's Banks in various parts of Jiangsu Province helped the cooperatives formulate and revise production and financial plans in accordance with the principle of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, ensuring that production costs are reduced and the income of members is increased. However, some areas do not conduct in-depth investigations into the economic conditions and actual needs of cooperatives when issuing loans, granting loans whenever they are requested, so that loans are given even to those who should not be given them; other areas are too strict in controlling loans, and loans are not given even when they should be given. According to an inspection in Anhui Province, in Haikou, Baoying, and Peiyi townships in Shankou District, Huaining County, 166 cooperative members were able to pay the share fund and also received poor peasant cooperative fund loans; however, in eight cooperatives in Linquan, Quanjiao, and other places, 42 households still owed 1,771 yuan in share fund, and were truly unable to pay, but were unable to obtain loans.

    In order to avoid this unreasonable phenomenon, all localities should make plans for agricultural loan work, help agricultural production cooperatives calculate carefully, tap their own funding potential, and after the cooperatives have fully utilized their own funds, if the funds are still insufficient, banks can provide loans, so that loans are truly used to increase production. After the loans are issued, practical inspections should also be carried out to identify problems and solve them in a timely manner.

    发挥国家农业贷款的作用
    朱裕昆
    今年国家发放农业贷款的总指标达到三十亿元，单是这一年增加的数字，就比过去五年农贷的累积总数还多。最近国家银行又为农民增拨生活口粮贷款两亿元。今年国家从财政上给予农民的援助是空前地增加了。
    随着农业合作化的发展，农民的生活已经一年比一年地改善了；但是，仍然应该看到，目前许多农民在生产上和生活上还有很多困难。同时，不少地区的农业合作社把劳动力大多集中在主要农业生产上，这些地区农民的副业收入比过去减少了，有一部分人发生了缺乏口粮的困难。
    在这样的情况下，各地国家银行把贷款及时而又合理地发放下去，帮助灾区农民和一般地区贫困农民克服生活上、生产上的困难，鼓舞农民的生产积极性，就成了一项非常迫切的工作。在目前发放贷款中，各地银行对这次增拨的生活口粮贷款和原来计划的生活贷款，应该统一分配。对于灾区的合作社和贫困社员多的合作社，应当特别加以照顾，根据各个农户生活困难大小，实事求是地确定贷款数目，避免平均分配。此外，对社外个体贫困农民也应当切实地给予帮助，不应当忽略。
    正确地掌握国家发放农业贷款的政策，是发挥贷款在农业增产中的作用的主要关键。江苏省各地人民银行在向农业生产合作社发放贷款的时候，帮助合作社按照勤俭办社方针制定和修改生产财务计划，保证降低生产成本，增加社员收入。但是有些地区在发放贷款的时候，不深入地调查合作社的经济条件和实际需要，有求必应，以致对不应该贷给的也贷给了；另有一些地区又掌握偏紧，该贷的也不贷给。据安徽省检查，怀宁县山口区海口、保英、培义三个乡，有166户社员能缴纳起股份基金，也得到了贫农合作基金贷款；但是在临泉、全椒等八个社中，有四十二户还欠1，771元股份基金，确实无力缴纳，却又得不到贷款。
    为了避免这种不合理的现象发生，各地应该做好农业贷款工作的规划，帮助农业生产合作社算细账，挖掘它们自己的资金潜力，在合作社充分运用了自有资金以后，如果资金仍感不足，可由银行贷款，使贷款真正用到增加生产方面去。在贷款发放以后，还应该进行切实的检查，发现问题，及时解决。
