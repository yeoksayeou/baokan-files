Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, May 15th: The Communist Party branches of the Wuxing Agricultural Production Cooperative and the Yao'erwan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qin'an County, Gansu Province, have recently criticized the phenomenon of disregarding the characteristics of women in agricultural production.

This year, the attendance rate of female members of the Wuxing Agricultural Production Cooperative has increased by 89.3% compared to the past. However, in the upsurge of production, both this cooperative and the Yao'erwan Agricultural Production Cooperative disregarded the physical conditions of women, assigning them overly heavy labor. Some women even persisted in heavy labor during menstruation or pregnancy, which affected their health. At the same time, female members, due to excessive labor, did not have time to manage household affairs, and some women did not even have time to change their clothes.

After discovering this problem, the Communist Party branches of the Wuxing Agricultural Production Cooperative and the Yao'erwan Agricultural Production Cooperative convened female Party members and cooperative cadres for serious discussions, and severely criticized this erroneous practice. They decided to widely publicize maternal and child hygiene, and to give male members a lecture on maternal and child hygiene knowledge every ten days in night school; women should be given less labor or assigned light labor during menstruation; pregnant women should be given a portion of work points when they are unable to work; time should be given to women to mend and wash clothes and take care of household affairs. In addition, the two branches also decided to educate all male members to assign farm work suitable for women and to take care of the special difficulties of women.

    两个农业生产合作社
    批判不照顾妇女的做法
    新华社兰州15日电　中共甘肃省秦安县五星农业生产合作社分支部和窑儿湾农业生产合作社分支部，最近批判了在农业生产上不照顾妇女特点的现象。
    五星农业生产合作社女社员今年出勤率比过去提高了89.3％。但是，这个社和窑儿湾农业生产合作社在生产高潮中不照顾妇女的身体条件，让妇女们担任过重的劳动，甚至妇女在月经或怀孕期间也坚持较重的劳动，因而影响了她们的健康。同时，女社员们由于劳动过多，就没有时间管理家务，有的妇女甚至没有时间换洗衣服。
    中共五星农业生产合作社分支部和窑儿湾农业生产合作社分支部发现这个问题后，召集社内的妇女党员、社干部进行了认真讨论，严肃地批判了这种错误的做法。决定要普遍进行妇婴卫生宣传，在夜校里每十天对男社员讲一次妇婴卫生常识；妇女在月经期间应让她少劳动或担任轻微劳动；怀孕妇女在不能劳动的时候，应给她一部分工分；要给妇女缝补换洗衣服和处理家务的时间。此外，这两个分支部还决定：要教育全体男社员给妇女分配适合于妇女做的农活，照顾妇女的特殊困难。
