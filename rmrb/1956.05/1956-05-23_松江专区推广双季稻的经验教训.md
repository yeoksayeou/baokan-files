The Songjiang Prefecture of Jiangsu Province planned to sow 1.23 million mu of double-cropping rice this year, but the actual planted area is only 568,000 mu. This change in the plan has resulted in losses in terms of seeds, fertilizers, and labor. The plans, labor arrangements, and small-scale operation plans of agricultural production cooperatives have also been disrupted and need to be revised. The leadership of the prefecture has gained beneficial experiences and lessons in this work.

The process of promoting double-cropping rice in Songjiang Prefecture this year is as follows: During the high-yield movement, Songjiang Prefecture planned to plant 1.4 million mu of double-cropping rice, accounting for 44% of the paddy field area. The plan was based on: natural conditions being scientifically determined to be suitable for double-cropping rice; in 1955, more than 80 locations in the entire prefecture, totaling 107 mu of double-cropping rice, achieved a high yield of 804 jin per mu on average; and collective production after agricultural cooperation solving the need for more labor and fertilizer for planting double-cropping rice. At that time, cadres and farmers were elated by the prospect of increased production from large-scale planting of double-cropping rice, but some people had doubts. Those in late-rice areas were afraid that early rice would not grow well, those in early-rice areas were afraid that late rice would not be harvested, and those in rice-wheat double-cropping and cotton-grain intercropping areas felt that switching to double-cropping rice was not safe. Many agricultural cooperative members considered the problem of insufficient labor.

As the sowing time approached, after repeated discussions, the area for double-cropping rice was reduced from 1.4 million mu to 1.23 million mu. The early rice sowing of double-cropping rice is earlier than that of single-cropping early rice, and the temperature this year is lower than in previous years. From the beginning of soaking seeds to promote germination, many technical difficulties were encountered, resulting in a germination rate of only 70%, of which 30% were yellow seedlings that could not be transplanted. Cadres and the masses generally worried that double-cropping rice would fail. Farmers reflected that in order to plant double-cropping rice, they plowed down the green manure in advance, but the double-cropping rice did not grow well. This was like "killing a son to recruit a son-in-law," which was really not worthwhile.

Before transplanting, the Songjiang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an emergency meeting, determining the policy of "planting according to seedlings and ensuring success." At the same time, effective measures were proposed to prevent the possible losses brought about by this change. As a result, the actual planted area was 568,000 mu.

Li Chu, Secretary of the Songjiang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, told reporters: "The work of promoting double-cropping rice has given us extremely profound lessons. It is certain that Songjiang area has the conditions to grow double-cropping rice. The lesson is that we did not carefully and comprehensively consider the key to increasing production based on the specific conditions of the area, and ordered an overly large plan to promote double-cropping rice with hot heads. Facts in recent years have proved that rice-wheat double-cropping in Songjiang area has already been one of the key factors to increase production with certainty. In 1955, the average annual yield of 270,000 mu of large-area rice-wheat double-cropping fields in three counties in the late-rice area reached 653 jin, and there were also typical examples of more than 1,000 jin, showing that the potential for increasing production with rice-wheat double-cropping is very large. The two crops a year and five crops in two years system in Fengxian County has resulted in an annual grain yield of more than 650 jin per mu for the county's grain fields. Double-cropping rice is the key to increasing production, but simply and excessively emphasizing the change to double-cropping rice has great one-sidedness. The technicality of planting double-cropping rice is very strong, and large-scale planting of double-cropping rice is a major reform of farmers' production habits. We only based ourselves on sporadic examples of increased production from double-cropping rice, and without conducting a test planting on a wide area, we promoted it on a large scale. From the preparation work such as soaking seeds to promote germination before the seeds were planted, serious situations of technology not keeping up appeared. Farmers did not have direct experience, and dared not to do anything, waiting for technicians to teach them how to do it. The more than 50,000 technicians trained in the entire prefecture could only conduct technical guidance based on the provisions of the technical guidelines, and did not know where the problems were when problems arose. Farmers said that we were 'abandoning things we were sure of to do risky things we were not sure of.' This is a very pertinent criticism of us. From the perspective of inspecting the leadership's thinking, the more serious problem is that when determining the plan under the subjective demand for increased production, we emphasized the favorable aspects more and calmly considered the unfavorable aspects less. Some grassroots cadres also raised many difficulties, and many farmers with practical production experience at the time doubted that the area was too large, and hoped to plant a little less this year and then promote it on a large scale after gaining experience. These situations did not receive the attention we should have given them. Experience tells us: we must carefully consider opinions that are different from our own ideas, especially when our minds are heated."

    松江专区推广双季稻的经验教训
    新华社记者　于生　古平
    江苏省松江专区今年推广双季稻是按照123万亩的种植面积播种的，现在实种面积只有五十六万八千亩。这个规划的改变在种子、肥料和劳动力方面都受到了损失。农业生产合作社的计划、劳动规划和小段作业计划也被打乱，需要加以修正。专区的领导方面在这一工作中取得了有益的经验教训。
    松江专区今年推广双季稻的过程是这样：在高额丰产运动中，松江专区规划种植双季稻一百四十万亩，占稻田面积44％。规划的根据是：自然条件经过科学鉴定适宜种植双季稻；1955年全专区有八十多处共一百零七亩双季稻获得平均每亩八百零四斤的高产量；农业合作化后的集体生产，解决了种植双季稻需要的更多的劳力和肥料。当时，干部和农民为大面积种植双季稻的增产远景而欢欣鼓舞，但也有一部分人有疑虑。晚稻地区的怕早稻种不好，早稻地区的怕晚稻收不成，稻麦两熟和棉粮夹种地区认为改种双季稻不保险。许多农业社的社员考虑到劳动力不足的问题。
    快要播种的时候，经过一再讨论，把双季稻的面积从一百四十万亩减到一百二十三万亩。双季稻的前季早稻播种要比单季早稻早，今年气候温度又比往年低。从浸种催芽开始，就碰到了技术上的许多困难，结果出苗率只有70％，其中又有30％的黄秧不能移栽。干部和群众普遍担心双季稻要落空。农民反映：为了种双季稻，提前把绿肥耕掉，双季稻又种不好，这是“打死儿子招女婿”，实在不合算。
    插秧以前，中共松江地委召开了紧急会议，确定“量苗种植、保证成功”的方针。同时，提出有效措施防止这一改变可能带来的损失。结果，实种面积是五十六万八千亩。
    中共松江地委书记李楚同志对记者说：“推广双季稻的工作给我们的教训是极为深刻的。在松江地区有条件种植双季稻，这是肯定的。教训是我们没有根据本区的具体情况慎重地全面考虑增产关键，头脑子热烘烘地订了个过大的推广双季稻的规划。几年来的事实证明，松江地区的稻麦两熟已经是有了把握的主要增产关键之一。1955年晚稻地区三个县二十七万亩大面积稻麦两熟田平均年产量达六百五十三斤，也有千斤以上的典型，可见稻麦两熟的增产潜力很大，奉贤县的两年五熟制，全县粮田每亩年产量在六百五十斤以上。双季稻是增产关键，但单纯地过分强调改种双季稻，是有很大片面性的。种植双季稻的技术性很强，大面积种植双季稻是农民生产习惯的大改革，我们仅仅根据双季稻增产的零星事例，没有进行过一个面的试种，就大面积推广，从落谷前的浸种催芽等准备工作开始就出现了技术跟不上去的严重情况。农民没有直接经验，不敢动手，等待技术员教怎样干就怎样干。全专区训练的五万多名技术员也只能根据技术纲要的条文进行技术指导，出了毛病也不知道出在什么地方。农民说我们‘放着有把握的事情不干而去做无把握的冒险’。这对我们是一个很中肯的批评。从领导思想上来检查，更严重的问题是我们在主观的增产要求下，确定规划时，强调有利的一面多，冷静考虑不利的一面少。有些基层干部也提出过许多困难，许多有实际生产经验的农民当时疑虑面积太大，希望今年少种一点，取得经验后再大面积推广。这些情况，都没有引起我们应有的重视。经验告诉我们：必须认真考虑和自己的想法不同的意见，特别是在自己的头脑子发热的时候。”
