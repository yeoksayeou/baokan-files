    The Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation held a meeting in Beijing from April 24 to 30, 1956. One hundred and eighty-three delegates and guests from forty-eight countries attended the meeting, including leaders of women's groups from various countries, representatives of various organizations and associations, and prominent figures from various continents of the world.

    Many of them, especially those from Asian and African countries, were participating in a meeting of the Women's International Democratic Federation for the first time.

    The Council heard two reports, one on "The Tasks of the Women's International Democratic Federation in Striving for Peace, Women's Rights, and the Well-being of Children," and the other on "The Aspirations and Activities of Women in Asia and Africa."

    These reports and speeches emphatically pointed out the achievements made by the women's movement in uniting women to defend peace, defend women's rights, and protect children since the last Council meeting, as well as the important role played by the Women's International Democratic Federation in achieving these achievements. These achievements have strengthened the development of the women's movement and contributed to progress in cooperating in the spirit of the principles of peaceful coexistence and in easing international tensions.

    However, these speeches emphasized that the arms race, atomic tests, and the manufacture of new weapons continue to pose a terrible threat of war.

    All women have a responsibility to increasingly strengthen unity and demand a ban on such tests and a ban on such atomic weapons, as well as demand universal disarmament. It is difficult to solve the most critical problems of the present without doing so, because achieving these demands is a basic necessity for the people of all countries to live a better life. Therefore, they will support all movements calling for disarmament and the banning of atomic weapons.

    These speeches all expressed the need to unite millions of women more and more, thereby developing the women's movement on an increasingly broad scale, and pointed out that expanding unity and cooperation is the main task.

    Many women's groups, as well as national and international organizations, have recognized the effectiveness of unity and cooperation in defending women's rights and protecting children and peace.

    The Council is pleased to record the achievements that have been made, which have enabled women, associations, groups, and prominent figures of various types to unite through joint action on certain issues.

    The development of unity and cooperation urgently requires all groups to study the practical possibilities of working on issues that are in line with the greatest concerns and deepest aspirations of women in certain national contexts.

    The Council calls on national member organizations to:

    ——Redouble their efforts to find new activities and new forms of work that can increasingly deepen women's mutual understanding and promote women's united strength in action;

    ——Approach women by supporting the demands and rights of women of various types: rural women, female workers, female office workers, housewives, intellectuals, freelancers, etc.;

    ——Seek with confidence all possible meetings with other women's groups and organizations, as well as prominent women, to discuss and jointly decide on joint actions or movements.

    The Council draws the attention of national member organizations to the need to strengthen their respective organizations, and the Council points out that many of these organizations must understand how to adapt their organizational structure to new requirements, so that even women and groups who have not joined our organization can cooperate jointly.

    The Council has learned that personal contacts between women of various countries and exchanges of delegations, especially between countries with different social systems, have continuously developed fruitfully. The Council recommends increasing such exchanges, and the Council points out that such relationships, especially between people engaged in the same industry or concerned with similar issues, have been established very effectively.

    The Council requests the Executive Bureau of the Women's International Democratic Federation to take the necessary actions to develop contacts with representatives of various international women's organizations to promote mutual understanding, exchange experiences, and seek common goals and a basis for cooperation.

    The Council recommends that the Executive Bureau study the possibility of establishing an international annual award named after the outstanding female scientist Irène Joliot-Curie.

    国际民主妇女联合会理事会北京会议
    关于国际民主妇联任务的决议
    国际民主妇女联合会理事会从1956年4月24日到30日在北京举行会议。参加会议的有四十八个国家的一百八十三位代表和来宾，包括各国妇女团体的领导人、各团体和协会的代表以及世界各洲的著名人士。
    她们中间许多人，特别是从亚洲和非洲国家来的人，是第一次参加国际民主妇联的会议。
    理事会听取了两个报告，一个是“关于国际民主妇联争取妇女为了和平、为了妇女权利和为了儿童幸福而发挥的任务的报告”，另一个是“关于亚洲和非洲妇女愿望和活动的报告”。
    这些报告和发言，着重地指明自从上次理事会会议以来，妇女运动在团结妇女保卫和平、保卫妇女权利、保卫儿童方面所获得的成就以及国际民主妇联在取得这些成就方面所起的重要的作用。这些成就加强了妇女运动的发展，有助于在根据和平共处原则的精神进行合作方面和缓和国际紧张局势方面获得进展。
    然而，这些发言强调说明：军备竞赛、原子试验和新式武器的制造在继续造成可怕的战争威胁。
    一切妇女有责任日益加强团结，要求禁止这种试验和禁止这种原子武器以及要求普遍裁军，不这样就难于解决当前最关紧要的问题，因为实现这些要求是各国人民过更好生活的基本必要条件。因此，他们将支持一切要求裁军和禁止原子武器的运动。
    这些发言都表示必须更多地团结千百万妇女，从而日益广泛地发展妇女运动，并且指出扩大团结和合作是主要的任务。
    许多妇女团体以及各国和国际团体已经认识到团结和合作在保卫妇女权利和保障儿童及和平方面的效能。
    理事会高兴地纪录已经获得了的成就，这些成就使得种种不同类型的妇女、协会、团体和著名人士在一定的问题上通过共同行动而联合起来。
    团结和合作的发展空前迫切地要求各团体研究在一定的国家的情况下，在符合于妇女的最大关怀和深刻愿望的各项问题上进行工作的实际可能性。
    理事会号召各国会员团体：
    ——加倍努力找出足以日益加深妇女的互相了解、促使妇女在行动中把力量联合起来的新的活动和新的工作形式；
    ——支持种种不同类型的妇女：农妇、女工、女职员、主妇、知识分子、自由职业者等等的要求和权利，这样去接近她们；
    ——充满信心地寻求一切可能同其他妇女团体和组织以及著名妇女人士会晤，以讨论并且共同决定共同的行动或运动。
    理事会提请各国会员团体注意必须加强各自的组织，理事会并且指出：这些团体中有不少团体必须懂得如何使得她们的组织结构适应于新的要求，从而使得甚至没有参加我们组织的妇女和团体也能共同合作。
    理事会获知各国妇女之间个人接触以及互换代表团，特别是在社会制度不同的国家之间的这种接触和互换，已经不断有了有结果的发展，理事会建议增加这类交换，理事会并且指出这样的关系，特别是在从事同一行业的人士或者关心相似问题的人士之间的关系已经很有效果地建立了起来。
    理事会要求国际民主妇联执行局采取必要的行动来发展同各个国际妇女团体代表的接触以促进互相了解，交流经验、寻求共同的目标和合作的基础。
    理事会建议执行局研究设立一个纪念卓越的女科学家伊伦·约里奥—居里的、以她的名字为名的国际年奖的可能性。
