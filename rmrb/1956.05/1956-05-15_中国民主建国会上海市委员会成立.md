The Shanghai Municipal Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association held its 1956 membership meeting from the 10th to the 13th. The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association was formally established at the meeting, and Sheng Pi Hua, Hu Jue Wen, Rong Yi Ren, and others were elected as members of the committee. Many activists who emerged during the high tide of socialist transformation were also elected as members.

At the meeting, Sheng Pi Hua delivered the opening speech. Hu Jue Wen gave a work report for the past three years. He pointed out that in the first quarter of this year, in coordination with the high tide of socialist transformation, the number of members of the Shanghai Municipal Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association has nearly doubled, and currently there are 1,942 members, of whom 79% are industrial and commercial capitalists and agents, as well as family members of industrial and commercial operators.

After discussion, the more than 1,600 members present at the meeting agreed that the central task of the Shanghai Municipal Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association in the future is to strengthen the political and ideological education of industrialists and businessmen, expand the ranks of backbone members in the industrial and commercial circles, and assist the state in thoroughly completing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. They also expressed at the meeting that they would strive to meet the four requirements put forward by the conference for them—loving socialism, studying hard, doing a good job in enterprise production and management, and closely contacting the masses in industrial and commercial circles.
