    Not a Reason
        On May 14th, the British House of Commons held a fierce debate on the Cyprus issue. Labour Party members criticized the Conservative government's policies in the debate, demanding self-determination for Cyprus.
        In response to questioning, Lennox-Boyd, the Colonial Secretary of the Conservative government, mentioned a document. He said that this document shows that the Labour government in 1951 rejected Greece's proposal to return the island to Greece.
        Lennox-Boyd's use of this tactic to silence the Labour Party did indeed embarrass the Labour leaders. However, this does not make the Conservative government's denial of the Cypriot people's right to self-determination any more reasonable.
    You Can't Have Both
        The "Washington Post" reported that Eisenhower plans to invite Soviet Marshal Zhukov and Marshal Konev to visit Washington before the US election.
        The newspaper said that the President's political advisors favored this plan. Because, "the issue of greatest concern to the American people is peace, and such a visit is a guarantee of peace." This would make "millions of voters" "think twice" before voting against Eisenhower.
        However, the President's foreign policy advisors and military advisors opposed it. "They fear that such a visit will lull the West to sleep,... making it difficult to obtain sufficient...military appropriations."
        Votes and military spending, you can't have both. Let's wait and see what the US government will choose.
    Who is the Mastermind?
        Who is the mastermind behind the incident that caused the death of British diver Crabb?
        British Labour Party member Zilliacus said that the US intelligence agency was the mastermind behind Crabb's mission to dive under the Soviet cruiser for espionage.
        He said, "The most likely explanation is the possibility that Lieutenant Commander Crabb—who had retired but was still occasionally invited to take on special tasks—was hired by the American intelligence agency this time, and utilized the connection between the American and British intelligence agencies, as well as his connection with the British intelligence agency."
    Buying Cannon Fodder Cheaply
        US Secretary of Defense Wilson testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee not long ago that: ... the United States is currently helping to support a total of two hundred divisions of "allied" troops, a force "equivalent to several times the strength of the US military." He said that without them, the United States would have to spend more money on its own troops. Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford also testified that "there are many compelling reasons" to say that doing so is better than the United States building its own forces. Because if the United States were to build its own forces, then in addition to "lacking the necessary unlimited manpower resources, the cost would be extremely high, even for our country to bear."
        Wilson and Radford thus admitted once again that the US "military aid" is merely a means of buying cannon fodder cheaply.

    不成理由
    五月十四日，英国下院就塞浦路斯问题进行了激烈的辩论。工党议员在辩论中抨击了保守党政府的政策，要求给予塞浦路斯自决。
    保守党政府殖民大臣伦诺克斯—波伊德在回答质询时提到了一个文件。他说，这个文件说明，1951年的工党政府拒绝了希腊提出的把这个岛屿归还给希腊的建议。
    伦诺克斯—波伊德用这个手段来堵工党的嘴，的确使工党领袖颇为狼狈。但是，这并不能使得保守党政府否认塞浦路斯人民自决权利的行为看起来有一点道理。
    两者不可兼得
    “华盛顿邮报”报道说：艾森豪威尔计划在美国大选以前邀请苏联的朱可夫元帅和科?夫元帅访问华盛顿。
    报纸说，总统的政治顾问们赞成这个计划。因为，“美国人民心中最关切的问题就是和平，而这样一种访问就是和平的保证”。这就有可能使“千千万万的选民们”在投反对艾森豪威尔的票时“慎重从事”。
    但是总统的外交政策顾问和军事顾问们却表示反对。“他们担心这样的访问将会把西方哄得睡觉，……以致很难取得充足的……军事拨款”。
    选票和军费，两者不可兼得，美国政府将怎样选择，且等着看吧。
    谁是主使人
    谁是使得英国潜水员克莱布伤命的事件的主使人？
    英国工党的齐里亚库斯说，美国情报处是克莱布潜水在苏联巡洋舰底下进行窥视的使命的主使人。
    他说，“最可能的解释是这样的可能性：克莱布中校——他已经退休，但仍旧不时被邀担负些特别任务——这次受美国特务机关雇用，并利用美国特务机关和英国特务机关的联系以及他和英国特务机关的联系。”
    廉价购买炮灰
    美国国防部长威尔逊不久以前在参议院外交委员会作证说：……美国目前正在帮助支持一共二百个师的“盟国”军队，这种部队“相当于美国军队实力的好几倍”。他说，假如没有它们，美国就必须为自己的军队花更多的钱。美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福也作证说，“有许多有力的理由”说明这样做比美国自己建立部队来得好。因为要是由美国自己来建立部队，那末除了“缺乏所需要的这样一种无限的人力资源以外，费用也会是极其高昂，哪怕是我国也是担负不起的”。
    威尔逊和雷德福这样就又一次承认，美国的“军事援助”不过是廉价购买炮灰的手段。
