Do not "Pass Off as Acceptable Upon Leaving the Factory"

The Shenyang Joint Public-Private Jianxing Iron Factory produced 750 double-wheeled, double-铧 (plowshare) plows in February of this year. Most of them were of poor quality, and even after rework, they still did not meet quality standards. The Ministry of Agriculture's agricultural implement quality inspection team suggested that the factory rework them again. However, the factory's public and private shareholders were unwilling to rework them. They said: Currently, it is the busy season for spring plowing, and farmers urgently need double-wheeled, double-铧 plows. In order to meet the need, they should be "passed off as acceptable upon leaving the factory."

Facts have proven that selling those "passed off as acceptable upon leaving the factory" agricultural implements to farmers not only fails to meet the farmers' needs but also hinders agricultural production and causes waste. The so-called "in order to meet the farmers' needs" by the leaders of the Jianxing Iron Factory is, in essence, an attempt to take advantage of the farmers' urgent need for agricultural implements to push substandard products out of the factory. This is a very irresponsible business mentality.

    不许“对付出厂”
    沈阳市公私合营建兴铁工厂今年二月份生产了七百五十台双轮双铧犁，其中大部分质量低劣，经过返修，仍达不到质量标准。农业部农具质量检查组建议这个厂重新返修。这个厂的公股和私股负责人却不愿返修。他们说：目前正是春耕紧张时节，农民迫切需要双轮双铧犁，为了满足需要，“对付出厂”算了。
    事实证明，把那些“对付出厂”的农具卖给农民，不但不能满足农民需要，还会妨碍农业生产，造成浪费。建兴铁工厂领导人的所谓“为了满足农民需要”，实质上是想趁农民急需农具的机会，把不合格品推出厂。这是一种很不负责的经营思想。
