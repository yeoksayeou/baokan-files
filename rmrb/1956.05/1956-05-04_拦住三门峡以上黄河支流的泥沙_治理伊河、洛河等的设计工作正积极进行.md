　　Block Sediment from the Yellow River Tributaries Above Sanmenxia:
    Design Work for Governing the Yi River, Luo River, etc. is Actively Underway
    Xinhua News Agency report: While the Sanmenxia Yellow River Dam project is about to commence, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission is also actively preparing to fundamentally control the Yellow River's tributaries. This is in accordance with the first phase of the Yellow River Comprehensive Utilization Plan, to block sediment from the tributaries above Sanmenxia, protect the Sanmenxia Reservoir, develop industrial and agricultural production in the tributary basins, and resolve flood disasters in the lower reaches of the Yellow River.

    The Yellow River Survey and Design Institute is conducting a large amount of basic work on the governance of the Yellow River tributaries this year. After the basin planning work for the Yi River and Luo River in western Henan Province, and the Qin River basin in southeastern Shanxi Province and northwestern Henan Province, was completed at the end of January, preliminary design of the Yi River and Luo River reservoirs began in April; the preliminary design of one reservoir is to be completed this year. The basin survey of the Sanchuan River in western Shanxi Province was completed in April, and basin planning has begun. In late March, two survey teams were also dispatched to the Jing River basin and the Wuding River basin to collect data.

　　拦住三门峡以上黄河支流的泥沙
    治理伊河、洛河等的设计工作正积极进行
    在黄河三门峡水库工程即将动工的同时，黄河水利委员会又积极进行根治黄河支流的准备工作。这是根据黄河综合利用规划第一期工程的规定，为了拦阻三门峡以上各支流的泥沙，以保护三门峡水库和发展支流流域地区的工农业生产、解决黄河下游的洪水灾害而进行的。
    黄河勘测设计院今年对黄河支流的治理进行大量的基本工作。河南省西部的伊河、洛河和山西省东南部、河南省西北部的沁河流域规划工作在一月底完成后，又在四月开始了伊河和洛河水库的初步设计；今年要完成一个水库的初步设计。山西省西部三川河的流域查勘在四月份完成后又开始了流域规划。三月下旬还派出了两个查勘队到泾河流域和无定河流域搜集资料。　　　（据新华社讯）
