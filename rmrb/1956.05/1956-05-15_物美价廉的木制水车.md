Inexpensive Wooden Waterwheel

Comrade Dai Liande and others, members of the Hongwei Agricultural Production Cooperative in Majiase Township, Kaiyuan County, Liaoning Province, have recently successfully trial-produced a type of wooden "Liberation" style waterwheel. This waterwheel has a relatively simple structure and can draw 27,000 catties of water per hour from a well five meters deep, which is more than the output of iron "Liberation" style waterwheels, and the price is only about 60 yuan.

Kaiyuan County has now produced more than 200 such waterwheels and plans to promote them on a large scale locally.

    物美价廉的木制水车
    辽宁省开原县马家塞乡红伟农业生产合作社社员代连德等最近试制成功一种木制解放式水车。这种水车构造较简单，在五公尺深的井内每小时能出水二万七千斤，比铁制解放式水车出水还多，价钱也只有六十元左右。
    开原县现在已制成二百多台这样的水车，并准备在当地大量推广。
