　　Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 6th. The Prime Minister's Press Office of the German Democratic Republic announced that Prime Minister Grotewohl wrote to West German Chancellor Adenauer regarding the Saar issue.

　　The letter stated: The Government of the German Democratic Republic has always maintained that the Saar region is German territory. Based on the results of the 1955 Saar plebiscite, the German people expect an end to any actions that politically and economically subordinate the Saar region to France, and expect the Saar region to be recognized and respected as German territory.

　　The letter then pointed out that in resolving the Saar issue, France's requirements for safeguarding its security and its economic interests should be taken into account. However, the purpose of the negotiations already held between the West German and French governments is to drag the Saar region into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization through the incorporation of the Saar region into West Germany. This violates the will of the Saar residents: to join a democratic and peaceful Germany, to strive for the easing of international tensions, to achieve mutual understanding, and to establish a European collective security system.

　　The Government of the German Democratic Republic suggests that the West German government, with the participation of representatives of the Saar government, begin joint discussions on the Saar issue in order to achieve a solution that conforms to the national interests of all German people. Such joint discussions mean taking a big step forward in achieving rapprochement and mutual understanding on the issue of uniting the whole of Germany into a peaceful, democratic, and independent state.

　　Grotewohl also wrote a letter with the same content to Saar Prime Minister Ney. This letter concluded with a suggestion: that the Saar region appoint a permanent plenipotentiary representative to the government of the German Democratic Republic in Berlin, and that the government of the German Democratic Republic also appoint a plenipotentiary representative to the Saar government to promote mutual understanding, establish economic and cultural relations, and promote the peaceful unification of Germany.

　　At the same time, German Democratic Republic Foreign Minister Bolz wrote to French Foreign Minister Pineau, stating the position of the German Democratic Republic government on the Saar issue.

　　Bolz's letter pointed out that resolving the German question in a peaceful and democratic manner is in the interests of both the French and German peoples. The Saar issue is a matter for the whole of Germany. It involves the attitude of the French people towards all German people and is of great significance for the development of Franco-German relations.

　　The Government of the German Democratic Republic believes that the unilateral decision between the French and West German governments is incompatible with the existence of two Germanys and violates the German people's demand for a peaceful and democratic unification of Germany. The Government of the German Democratic Republic points out that it does not recognize any decision on the Saar issue passed without its participation.

    根据萨尔和全德人民的愿望解决萨尔问题
　　民主德国政府分别写信给阿登纳、奈伊和比诺
    新华社柏林6日电　据德意志民主共和国总理新闻处宣布，格罗提渥总理就萨尔问题写信给西德总理阿登纳。
    信中说：德意志民主共和国政府一向认为，萨尔州是德国的领土。根据1955年萨尔公民投票的结果，德国人民期望终止把萨尔州在政治上和经济上隶属于法国的任何行动，期望萨尔州被承认为德国的领土而受到尊重。
    信中接着指出，在解决萨尔问题的时候应该估计到法国对保障它的安全的要求和法国的经济利益。不过西德和法国政府之间已经举行的谈判的目的是，通过萨尔州的归并到西德而把萨尔州也拖入北大西洋公约。这违背了萨尔居民的意志：要并入民主和和平的德国，争取缓和国际紧张局势，取得相互谅解和建立欧洲集体安全体系。
    德意志民主共和国政府建议西德政府，在吸收萨尔州政府代表的参加下，开始共同讨论萨尔问题，以便使它获得符合于全体德国人民的民族利益的解决。这种共同讨论意味着在把整个德国统一为一个和平、民主、独立的国家的问题上获得接近和相互谅解方面前进一大步。
    格罗提渥还写给萨尔州总理奈伊一封内容相同的信，这封信最后建议：由萨尔州委派一个常驻全权代表驻在柏林的德意志民主共和国政府，德意志民主共和国政府也委派一个全权代表驻在萨尔州政府，以促进相互谅解、建立经济文化关系和促进德国的和平统一。
    同时，德意志民主共和国外交部长博尔茨写信给法国外交部长比诺，申述了德意志民主共和国政府在萨尔问题上的立场。
    博尔茨的信中指出，以和平和民主的方式解决德国问题是符合法德两国人民的利益的。萨尔问题是整个德国的问题。它牵涉到法国人民对全体德国人民的态度，对发展法德两国关系有重大的意义。
    德意志民主共和国政府认为，法国和西德政府之间的片面决定是同两个德国存在的情况不相容的，它违背了德国人民关于以和平和民主的方式统一德国的要求。德意志民主共和国政府指出，它不承认在没有它参加的情况下通过的关于萨尔问题的任何决定。
