    Butterfly Gathering at the Foot of Erhai Lake and Cangshan Mountain

    Xinhua News Agency
    The annual "Butterfly Gathering" at the foot of Cangshan Mountain in the Erhai Lake region of Yunnan Province has arrived again. Legend has it that on this day, butterflies from all directions gather at the "Butterfly Spring" at the foot of the mountain. On the 24th, on the tree-lined avenue leading to the "Butterfly Spring," families of fishermen from the Erhai Lake, Tibetan herdsmen from the Zhongdian Plateau, Young Pioneers from near Dali County, border guards, and office cadres went in groups to watch. On the lush green grass and among the bushes around the "Butterfly Spring," above and below the audience, butterflies of various sizes and colors with gorgeous colors flew back and forth. What surprised people the most was that on the leaves of a large tree next to the spring, many black-bottomed, yellow-spotted butterflies were connected head to tail, hanging down like strings of violets.

    The "Butterfly Spring" is in the suburbs of Dali County and is one of the famous scenic spots in the Minjia family area of Erhai Lake. According to the Dali County Chronicles: There used to be a large tree next to the "Butterfly Spring." In late spring and early summer, the tree bloomed with flowers shaped like butterflies. Real butterflies and fake butterflies were linked together in a long string, hanging upside down from the top of the tree to the surface of the spring, colorful and spectacular.

    Among the Minjia family farmers in the villages near the "Butterfly Spring," there is still a beautiful legend similar to "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai."

    洱海点苍山脚下的蝶会
    云南省洱海地区点苍山脚下一年一度的“蝶会”又到了。相传在这一天，各处的蝴蝶都到山麓下的“蝴蝶泉”相会。二十四日，通往“蝴蝶泉”的林荫大道上，来自洱海边的民家族渔民，来自中甸高原的藏族牧者，大理县附近的少先队员们，边防军和机关干部，都成群结队前往观看。在“蝴蝶泉”周围绿油油的草地上和丛树间，在观众的头上和脚下，有着绚丽色彩的各种颜色的大小蝴蝶，穿梭般地飞舞。最令人们感到惊异的是：在泉旁一株大树的树叶上，许多黑底黄点的蝴蝴首尾相衔，像紫罗兰一般一串串地悬挂下来。
    “蝴蝶泉”在大理县城郊，是洱海边民家族地区著名胜景之一。据大理县志载：从前“蝴蝶泉”旁有一株大树，春末夏初，树上开花，花形如蝴蝶，真蝴蝶和假蝴蝶联成一长串，从树顶倒挂到泉面，五彩缤纷，蔚为奇观。
    在“蝴蝶泉”附近村子的民家族农民，至今还流传着类似“梁山伯与祝英台”那样美丽的传说。
