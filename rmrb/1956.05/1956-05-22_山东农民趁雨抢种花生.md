Shandong Farmers Seize the Opportunity to Plant Peanuts During the Rain

    In early and mid-May, Shandong Province experienced successive widespread rainfall. Party and government organs in various peanut-producing areas have dispatched large numbers of cadres after the rain to lead agricultural production cooperatives in rushing to plant peanuts. Currently, the southern areas of Linyi, Tai'an, and other regions have completed more than 60% of their peanut planting plans. The Shandong Peninsula and Changwei, Huimin, and other regions have also planted more than 1.2 million mu of peanuts.

    Shandong Province has historically ranked first in the country in peanut production. This year, the province plans to plant 13 million mu of peanuts, an increase of 2.92 million mu compared to last year.

    In order to increase the yield per mu of peanuts, agricultural production cooperatives in various places are also actively improving planting techniques. More than half of the province is using peanut rhizobium to treat seeds. Linyi, Tai'an, and other regions are widely promoting the experience of early planting or intercropping peanuts in wheat fields. This alone can increase production by 20% to 30% compared to late peanuts planted after the wheat harvest. (Xinhua News Agency)

    山东农民趁雨抢种花生
    山东省在五月上、中旬接连普遍降雨，各花生产区的党、政机关都在雨后派出大批干部，领导农业生产合作社抢种花生。现在，南部临沂、泰安等专区已经完成花生种植计划的60％以上，山东半岛和昌潍、惠民等专区也已经播种花生一百二十多万亩。
    山东省历年花生产量占全国第一位。今年全省计划种植花生一千三百万亩，比去年扩大292万亩。
    为提高花生的单位面积产量，各地农业生产合作社还积极提高播种技术。全省使用花生根瘤菌拌种的占半数以上。临沂、泰安等专区普遍推广早种或在麦田里套种花生的经验，仅这一项就可以比麦收后播种的晚花生增产两成到三成。　（新华社）
