    Quickly Let New Products Meet Consumers
    Kong Sang
    After reading "The Encounter of New Products from Shijiazhuang Enamel Factory," we deeply feel that the birth of a new product and its replacement of old products in the market indeed requires a struggle.
    It is so incomprehensible to like new products and yet not allow them to meet consumers! But in the eyes of some comrades in the Shijiazhuang Department Store, they have reasons and difficulties for doing so. The reason is the principle of "first in, first out, last in, last out" instructed by the higher authorities for warehouse materials. The difficulty is that there is a considerable amount of old products in stock. If only old products are displayed in the counters, without giving consumers room to choose, they still cannot be sold. If new products are displayed, everyone will buy new products, then who will buy the old products?
    For commodities of the same variety, specification, and quality, the principle of selling those that entered the warehouse first and then those that entered later should be followed. This can avoid some commodities from deteriorating due to being stored in the warehouse for too long. However, for commodities of different varieties, specifications, and qualities, what consumers need should be sold; what is not needed should be stockpiled (this is very natural). For new products, they should be allowed to meet consumers quickly. Forcibly suppressing commodities favored by consumers in the warehouse and only displaying commodities not favored by consumers on the counters, forcing consumers to buy them, this, in practical terms, will play a role in打击 new products and protecting old products, which is the so-called "打击 advanced and protecting the backward."
    After new products come out, the sales of old products will indeed be affected. However, even if new products are not sold, the stockpiling of old products is inevitable, because no one can force consumers to buy what they do not like! Since this is the case, if new products that are more favored by consumers are not sold, then wouldn't it be stockpiling things that originally didn't need to be stockpiled? Wouldn't it be turning the stockpiling of only old products into the stockpiling of both new and old products? From the perspective of the overall interests of the country, isn't it more worthwhile to let new products meet consumers quickly?

    赶快让新产品跟消费者见面
    孔桑
    读了“石家庄搪瓷厂新产品的遭遇”以后，我们深深地感到：一种新产品的诞生以及在市场上代替旧产品，确实要经过一番斗争的。
    又喜欢新产品，又不让它跟消费者见面，这是多么不可理解的事！但在石家庄百货公司的一些同志看来，他们这样做是有根据，有苦衷的。根据就是上级指示的“仓库物资先进先出，后进后出”的原则，苦衷就是：旧产品存货相当多，在柜台里只摆旧产品，不让消费者有挑选的余地还卖不出，要是把新产品摆出来，大家都买新产品，那末旧产品卖给谁呢？
    对于经营同样品种规格，同等质量的商品来说，应该执行先进仓库的先出售，后进仓库的后出售的原则，这样可以避免一些商品因在仓库呆的时间过长而变质。但是，对于不同品种规格，不同质量的商品，应该是消费者需要的就卖；不需要的就积压（这是很自然的）。对于新产品，则应该让它们迅速跟消费者见面。硬把消费者喜爱的商品压在仓库里，只把消费者不喜爱的商品摆在柜台上，强迫消费者购买，这从实际的效果来看，就会起一种打击新产品，保护旧产品的作用，也就是所谓“打击先进，保护落后”。
    新产品出来以后，旧产品的销售确实会受到影响。但是，即使不卖新产品，旧产品的积压也是不可避免的，因为谁也不能强迫消费者购买他们所不喜爱的东西啊！既然是这样，如果不经销比较为消费者所喜爱的新产品，那末，岂不是把本来可以不积压的东西也积压了吗？岂不是把本来只积压旧产品变成积压新旧产品了吗？从国家的整体利益着想，难道不是让新产品迅速跟消费者见面更合算吗？
