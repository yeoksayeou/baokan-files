    They are Advancing in Increasingly Close Unity
    Lanhai
    Early in the morning, two enormous scarlet balloons with the words "Long Live May Day!" written on them floated gently from either side of the presidium of the Tokyo May Day celebration rally. They seemed to be buoyed by the songs and slogans of tens of thousands of people in the rally venue, rising higher and higher, ascending into the tall, blue, May sky. From the presidium of the celebration rally, the vast, verdant, ten-thousand-tsubo (approx. 8 acres) Meiji Jingu Outer Garden Square, filled with five hundred thousand Japanese working people, hoisting red flags and banners, formed a sea of people and flags.
    Throughout the rally venue, what caught the eye were the flags of many new trade union names that had not been seen in the past and many people who were attending the rally for the first time.
    In the past, the female nurses of the Japanese Red Cross Society, who only watched the demonstration parades from the side of the street with trepidation every May Day, participated this spring in the just struggle against the government's reduction of social welfare expenditures in the national budget and the increased burden on patients. They raised their awareness in the struggle, and today they participated in the rally, holding banners that read "Oppose the Revision of the Health Insurance Law."
    The female workers of the Tokyo Yaoi Wireless Electric Equipment Factory also joined the ranks of celebrating May Day for the first time. They said that the heroic struggle of the female workers of the Omi Silk Textile Factory had made them understand many things. They formed a trade union last June and participated in the spring struggle for higher wages this year. Three hundred of their one thousand members came today.
    The "National Federation of Textile Industry Workers' Unions" had four thousand people in its ranks today. Just two years ago, these textile workers did not even have the freedom to sing. Now, with headbands printed with the words "Unity" and "Unification" and arms linked together, they marched into the rally venue, singing the "National Independence Action Team Song" in loud voices.
    The employees of the National Tax Agency, who are currently engaged in a heated struggle against the unreasonable dismissal of trade union cadres, had only twenty people participating in the May Day celebration rally in 1946, and only one hundred and fifty people by 1954, but today their ranks have surged to one thousand people.
    In the struggle to safeguard the basic rights of workers and fight for independence, democracy, and peace, Japanese workers have realized through personal experience that victory can only be achieved through united struggle. Therefore, more and more workers are joining trade unions. Of the total number of 16.59 million workers, 6.18 million are now trade union members. Compared with the highest pre-war figure in 1936, the number of organized workers in Japan has increased fifteenfold.
    Farmers from Sunagawa Town, who have been steadfastly opposing the American military base for a year, also appeared for the first time at the celebration rally venue. They wore headbands with the word "Desperate" written on them, held high straw mats symbolizing the farmers' struggle, and were in high spirits. These days, they are engaged in a fierce struggle. On April 27th, under the urging of the United States, the Japanese authorities sent notices to the farmers of Sunagawa Town, demanding that they hand over their land and reply within a deadline. The next evening, they held a "Bonfire Rally Against Military Bases," collecting the notices and angrily throwing them into the raging bonfire, burning them all. A sixty-five-year-old farmer in the line said: "This is the first time since I was born that I have participated in a May Day celebration rally. Seeing so many people are our comrades, I have become even bolder. No matter how anyone threatens me, I will never hand over my land."
    Workers, farmers, fishermen, intellectuals, youth, students, housewives, citizens... five hundred thousand people gathered together, vividly demonstrating the power of the great unity of the Japanese working people, with the working class as the core.
    At exactly 10:00 a.m., the celebration rally began. The Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, Mosaburo Suzuki, the First Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, Sanzo Nosaka, and the Chairman of the Labor-Farmer Party, Hisao Kuroda, spoke at the rally one after another. They all emphasized the need to strengthen the unity of all democratic forces in Japan.
    Five hundred thousand Japanese working people participating in the rally, waving red flags and banners, passed resolutions and a rally declaration on defending democracy and peace and safeguarding the basic rights of workers in a warm and excited mood.
    The rally closed, and the magnificent May Day demonstration parade of the Japanese working people began.
    Five huge streams of people, divided into east, west, south, north, and central routes, advanced. The huge streams of people were led by bands. Demonstrators held high red flags and banners, advancing amidst the warm cheers of countless people on the roadside. Each banner was written with the firm voices of the Japanese people: "Workers of all countries, unite!" "Defend peace!" "Ban nuclear and hydrogen bomb testing!" "Yankee, go home!" "Oppose the revision of the Constitution!" "Oppose the small constituency system!" "Oppose rearmament!" "Restore Japan-Soviet and Japan-China diplomatic relations!"
    The central route marched along Akasaka and Nagatacho, heading towards the front of the National Diet Building. The procession of ten thousand members of the Tokyo Municipal Teachers' Union attracted special attention and great sympathy. Educators across Japan are engaged in a struggle against the Japanese government's revision of two education bills. The education bills revised by the Japanese government would change the public election system of education committees to a government appointment system and review all textbooks in order to restore militaristic education. The sight of teachers holding up a militaristic textbook, pressing down on a model of a child, painfully struck the heartstrings of people, especially those with children. "Protect the children!" The crowd on the roadside and the demonstrators shouted out heartfelt appeals together.
    When the huge procession of tens of thousands of people reached the headquarters of the Liberal Democratic Party, the procession began to move in a winding serpentine formation to express their dissatisfaction with the Liberal Democratic Party. When the procession reached the front of the Diet, it formed an even larger winding shape. Under the banner of the Japanese Communist Party, the First Secretary of the JCP, Sanzo Nosaka, the Secretary, Kenji Miyamoto, and Yojiro Konno also participated in the parade. In front of the Diet, more than one hundred Diet members from the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the Labor-Farmer Party waved flags, warmly cheering and welcoming the demonstration procession. Today, under the coercion of the Liberal Democratic Party, the Diet is discussing the small constituency bill. The propaganda vehicle at the front of the demonstration procession shouted: "Diet members of the Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the Labor-Farmer Party, join hands with the workers to stop the revision of the Constitution and smash the small constituency system!"
    While the five routes of demonstration processions were marching, the sailors of the All-Japan Seamen's Union, driving thirteen steamships decorated with slogans such as "Workers on the Water, Unite!" held a waterborne demonstration parade from Tokyo Port to the Sumida River.
    At 5:00 p.m., the demonstration processions arrived at their designated destinations in an orderly manner according to plan. On this holiday of the working people, the songs and slogans of the Japanese people opposing war and demanding independence, democracy, and peace reverberated in the sky above Tokyo, the capital of Japan, from morning to night.
    On the same day, celebration rallies for May Day were held in 656 cities across Japan. The Japanese people, headed by the working class, are rapidly advancing along the road of striving for independence, democracy, and peace. They are advancing in increasing strength, and they are advancing in increasingly close unity.

    他们在日益紧密地团结前进
    蓝海
    清晨，两个庞大的写着“五一节万岁！”的绯红色气球，从东京市“五一”节庆祝大会主席台的两侧轻轻浮起。它们像是被大会会场中成千成万人的歌声和口号声烘托着，向上升腾，向上升腾，升向那又高又蓝的五月的晴空。从庆祝大会的主席台上看去，绿树葱郁的宽广十万坪的明治神宫外苑广场上，五十万日本劳动人民，高举着红旗和标语牌，形成了一片人波和旗帜的海洋。
    大会会场中，到处令人触目的是许多过去没有见到过的新的工会名称的旗帜和许多头一次来参加大会的人们。
    过去，每逢“五一”节只是带着胆怯的心情在街旁观看示威队伍的日本红十字会的女护士们，今年春间参加了反对政府减少国家预算中社会福利费用、加重病人负担的正义斗争。她们在斗争中提高了认识，今天她们举着“反对修改健康保险法”的标语牌参加了大会。
    东京八欧无线电器材厂的女工们也是第一次加入庆祝“五一”节的行列。她们说，近江绢丝纺织厂女工们的英勇斗争使她们明白了许多事情。去年六月她们成立了工会，今年参加了要求提高工资的春季斗争。她们一千人中今天就来了三百人。
    “全国纤维产业工会同盟”的行列今天有四千人，就在两年之前，这些纺织工人们连唱歌的自由都还没有的，现在她们头上扎着印有“团结”、“统一”字样的头巾，臂膀挽着臂膀，高声唱着“民族独立行动队之歌”，走进了大会会场。
    目前热烈进行反对无理解雇工会干部斗争的国税厅的职工们，1946年参加“五一”节庆祝大会时才有二十人，到1954年，也只有一百五十人，而今天他们的队列激增到一千人了。
    日本工人在维护工人基本权利和争取独立、民主与和平的斗争中，切身的体验使他们认识到，只有团结起来进行统一的斗争，才能取得胜利，因而参加工会的工人越来越多了。在总数1，659万的工人中，目前已有618万人成为工会会员。比起战前最高数字的1936年，日本有组织的工人增加了十五倍。
    坚持反对美国军事基地斗争已经一年的砂川町农民，也第一次在庆祝大会会场上出现。他们扎着写着“决死”的头巾，高举着标志农民斗争的席旗，情绪十分激昂。这几天，他们正在进行激烈斗争。四月二十七日，日本当局在美国的催促下向砂川町农民分送了通知书，要他们交出土地并限期答复。第二天晚上，他们举行了“反对军事基地营火会”，把通知书收集起来愤怒地投入到熊熊的营火中全部烧毁。队列中的一个六十五岁的老农民说：“我出生以来头一次参加‘五一’节庆祝大会，看到这么多人都是我们的同伙，我的胆子更壮了，不管任何人再怎样威吓，我也决不交出土地。”
    工人、农民、渔民、知识分子、青年、学生、家庭主妇、市民……五十万人汇集在一起，鲜明地显示出来以工人阶级为核心的日本劳动人民大团结的力量。
    十时正，庆祝大会开幕。日本社会党主席铃木茂三郎，日本共产党第一书记野坂参三，劳农党主席黑田寿男先后在大会上讲话，他们都强调了日本一切民主力量的加强团结。
    五十万参加大会的日本劳动人民，挥舞着红旗和标语牌，在热烈和兴奋的精绪中，通过了关于保卫民主与和平、关于维护工人基本权利的决议和大会宣言。
    大会闭幕，日本劳动人民雄壮的“五一”节示威游行开始了。
    五十万人的五支巨大的人流，分为东、西、南、北、中路前进。巨大的人流以乐队为前导。示威者高举着红旗和标语牌，在道旁无数群众的热烈欢呼中向前行进。每一个标语牌上面写着日本人民坚决的呼声：“全世界无产者联合起来！”“保卫和平！”“禁止试验原子弹和氢弹！”“美国佬，滚回去！”“反对修改宪法！”“反对小选举区制！”“反对重新武装！”“恢复日苏、日中邦交！”
    中路队伍沿着赤坂、永田町，走向国会议事堂门前。示威队伍中，东京市教职员工会的一万人的行列，引起了人们的特别注意和巨大同情。日本全国教育工作者正在进行反对日本政府修改两项教育法案的斗争。日本政府修改的教育法案，要把教育委员会的公选制改为政府任命制，要审定一切教科书，以恢复军国主义教育。教师们高举着的一本军国主义大书压着孩子的模型，沉痛地击打着人们特别是有孩子的人们的心弦。“保卫孩子！”道旁的人群和示威者一起喊出了由衷的呼声。
    数万人的巨大行列到达自由民主党本部门前的时候，队伍开始变为弯曲的蛇形队列行进，以表示对自由民主党的不满。队伍到达国会门前的时候，形成更大的弯曲形了。在日本共产党的旗帜下，日共第一书记野坂参三、书记宫本显治、绀野与次郎也参加了游行。在国会的门前，社会党、共产党、劳农党的国会议员一百多人，挥舞着旗帜，热烈地欢呼着，迎接示威队伍。今天，国会中正在自由民主党的强制下，讨论小选举区法案。示威队伍前面的宣传车高呼：“社会党、共产党、劳农党的国会议员们，和工人们携起手来，阻止修改宪法，粉碎小选举区制！”
    在五路示威队伍游行的同时，全日本海员工会的海员们，驾驶着十三艘甲板上装饰着“水上的工人们团结起来！”等标语的汽艇，从东京港到隅田川，举行了水上示威游行。
    下午五时，示威队伍按照计划，秩序井然地先后到达了预定的目的地。在这个劳动人民的节日里，日本人民反对战争，要求独立、民主和和平的歌声和口号声，从清晨到夜晚，一直在日本首都东京市的上空震荡。
    同一天，日本全国六百五十六个城市举行了庆祝“五一”节大会。以工人阶级为首的日本人民正在沿着争取独立、民主与和平的道路迅速前进。他们在日益壮大地前进，他们在日益紧密地团结前进。
