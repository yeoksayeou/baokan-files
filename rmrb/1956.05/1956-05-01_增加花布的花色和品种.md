    Increase the Variety and Designs of Printed Fabric
    Li Yinchu, Director of Tianjin No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory
    In April 1953, under the leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee, we launched a mass quality inspection campaign and criticized the ideology of not emphasizing quality.
    In order to improve product quality and expand sales, we established a pattern design studio in response to the problems that existed in product quality in the past. We gave the designers a certain amount of time to go deep into the countryside, markets, and schools to conduct investigations and visits. Based on the different preferences of different groups, we designed printed patterns and then took them to the masses to solicit opinions.
    Our work has received strong support from the masses. Many people wrote to us with suggestions, and even drew patterns and sent them to us. Some people even cut off pieces of their own clothing material and sent them to us for reference. A young nursery worker in Beijing named Zhang Huiru saw that children liked to wear new clothes to participate in the "May Day" parade, but there was no suitable printed fabric on the market, so she designed many patterns that children liked and sent them to us. A comrade named Bai Yuhui from the Shaanxi Postal and Telecommunications Bureau sent us her mother's wedding quilt cover. The large floral fabric designed by our designers with reference to the pattern of this quilt cover is very popular with consumers. The printed skirt fabric suitable for young girls to wear was also designed based on suggestions from students at the High School Affiliated to Hebei Normal University.
    In order to improve product quality and continuously increase new varieties, in addition to learning from the advanced experience of acid-alkali desizing recommended by Soviet experts, we also learned from the advanced experience of fraternal factories in Shanghai and Qingdao. Within the factory, we organized various experience exchange meetings, established technical spare-time schools, and held different technical research meetings for different work sections. Niu Junshan, a printing worker and municipal model worker, compiled his experience in mastering printing quality over the years into rhymes and taught them to workers in each printing machine team.
    Through the efforts of all employees and engineering and technical personnel, the patterns and varieties of printed fabrics have increased year by year, and the quality has improved year by year. For example, in 1952, we could only produce 63 new patterns. In 1953, we increased to 101 types. In 1954 and 1955, we increased to 160 types. This year, we will design 220 new patterns to meet people's requirements for beautifying life. In the past, we could only print and dye serge, plain cloth, and twill. Now we can print and dye poplin, linen, fine cloth, and venetian, etc. From last year to now, we have also successively trial-produced light and dark snowflake tweed, light and dark single-sided printing, naphthol smoke color discharge printing, veramine blue discharge printing, and indigosol anti-dyeing, among other new varieties. These new varieties have bright background colors and excellent fastness effects. In terms of quality, the first-class rate of printed serge reached 97.66% last year, an increase of 18.86% compared to 1952. The first-class rate of printed venetian reached 96.87% last year, an increase of 23.48% compared to 1952. The first-class rate of light plain cloth reached 98.06% last year, an increase of 24.87% compared to 1952. From March of last year to March of this year, except for one variety in July of last year whose quality was 0.45% below the national standard, the product varieties and quality of other products have comprehensively overfulfilled the national plan targets on a monthly basis.
    With improved quality and increased varieties and patterns, sales quickly opened up. In the past, our products were only sold in Hebei and the Northeast. Now they have expanded to Hunan, Chongqing, Anhui, and other places. At the same time, the quantity of products has also increased from several hundred pieces per day in the past to several thousand pieces. By the end of this year, we will increase to more than 4,500 pieces per day.
    Costs have also been reduced significantly. For example, the unit cost of red floral serge last year was 34.22% lower than in 1953, and the total cost was 8.67% lower than planned. Among them, the comparable product cost was 20.98% lower than in 1954, saving a net total of more than 553,000 yuan for the whole year, overfulfilling the savings task. Our various economic plan targets have reached the level stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan two years ahead of schedule.
    Due to our achievements in production, we have continuously received commendations from higher authorities and have been awarded the title of Model Factory. All employees and engineering and technical personnel, encouraged by higher authorities and enthusiastically supported by consumers, are even more enthusiastic. Since the beginning of this year, we have made a full-year plan to improve product quality and have proposed an initiative to printing and dyeing factories throughout the city to launch a socialist competition centered on beautifying women's clothing. We plan to add 15 new colors to light-colored printed fabrics in the first and second quarters of this year, and add five new background colors to dark-colored printed fabrics in the third and fourth quarters, doubling the original planned varieties. In the first quarter of this year, we have trial-produced and produced eight new varieties, ten new colors, and forty-eight new patterns according to plan.
    The construction of the motherland is becoming more and more prosperous, and the lives of the people are becoming more and more beautiful. We have decided to bring out more and newer beautiful printed fabrics to beautify people's lives.

    增加花布的花色和品种
    天津市第一印染厂厂长　李寅初
    1953年四月间，我们在天津市委的领导下，开展了群众性的质量检查运动，批判了不重视质量的思想。
    为了提高产品质量，打开销路，我们针对过去在产品质量方面存在的问题，成立了图案设计室，给设计人员一定的时间，让他们深入农村、市场和学校，进行调查访问，根据不同群众的不同爱好，设计印花图案，然后再拿到群众中去征求意见。
    我们这一工作得到群众的大力支持，很多人来信给我们提意见，甚至自己画了图案寄给我们。有的人还把自己的衣料剪下来寄给我们参考。北京市有一位名叫张惠如的青年保育员，她看到孩子们都喜欢穿新衣服去参加“五一”节游行，市场上没有适合的花布，就自己设计很多为孩子所喜欢的图案寄给我们。陕西邮电局有位名叫白玉惠的同志，把她母亲结婚时的花被面寄给我们。我们的设计人员参考这个被面图案设计的大花布，很受消费者的欢迎。适合于少女们穿的印花裙布，也是我们根据河北师范学院附中同学们的建议设计的。
    为了提高产品质量，不断增加新品种，我们除了学习苏联专家建议的酸碱退浆先进经验外，还学习上海、青岛各兄弟厂的先进经验。在厂内，我们组织各种经验交流会，建立技术业余学校，召开不同工段的不同技术研究会。印花工人、市劳动模范牛俊山把自己几年来掌握印花质量的经验编成顺口溜，传授给印花机各班工人。
    经过全体职工和工程技术人员的努力，印染的花布的花样和品种一年比一年多，质量一年比一年提高。例如，1952年，我们只能生产63种新花样，1953年就增加到101种，1954年和1955年增加到160种，今年我们将设计220种新花样来满足人们美化生活的要求。过去我们只能印染哔叽、平布、斜纹，现在我们已能印染府绸、麻纱、细纺、直贡呢等。从去年到现在，我们还先后试生产了深浅色雪花呢、深浅色单面印花、纳夫吐烟色拔染、凡拉明蓝拔染、印地科素防染等新品种。这些新品种的花底颜色鲜艳，而且牢度效果很好。在质量方面，印花哔叽的正品率去年已达到97.66％，比1952年提高18.86％。印花直贡呢的正品率，去年已达到96.87％，比1952年提高了23.48％。浅平布正品率去年已达到98.06％，比1952年提高了24.87％。从去年三月份起到今年三月份止，除去年七月份有一种品种质量差0.45％没达到国家指标外，其他产品品种和质量都按月全面超额完成了国家计划指标。
    质量提高了，品种、花样增加了，很快就打开了销路。过去我们的产品销售地区只限于河北、东北，现在已扩大到湖南、重庆、安徽等地。与此同时，产品数量也从过去日产几百匹增加到几千匹。到今年年底，我们将增加到日产四千五百匹以上。
    成本也降低了不少。例如哔叽红花布，去年的单位成本就比1953年的降低了34.22％，总成本比计划降低了8.67％，其中可比产品成本比1954年降低了20.98％，全年净节约五十五万三千多元，超额完成了节约任务，我们的各项经济计划指标都提前两年达到了第一个五年计划所规定的水平。
    由于我们在生产上的成绩，不断得到上级的表扬，并获得了模范厂的称号。全体职工和工程技术人员在上级的鼓励和消费者的热情支持下，情绪更加高涨。今年以来，我们又做了提高产品质量的全年规划，并向全市印染厂提出倡议，开展了以美化妇女服装为中心的社会主义竞赛。我们计划今年一、二季度在浅色花布方面再增加新花色十五种，三、四季度在深色花布中再增加新底色五种，比原来计划品种增加了一倍。今年第一季度，我们已按计划试制和生产了八种新品种，十种新花色和四十八种新花样。
    祖国的建设愈来愈繁荣，人民的生活愈来愈美好。我们决定拿出更多更新颖的漂亮花布来美化人民的生活。
