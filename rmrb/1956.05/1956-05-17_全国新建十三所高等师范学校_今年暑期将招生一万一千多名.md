Thirteen newly established higher normal schools across the country are currently engaged in constructing school buildings, allocating cadres, and preparing for enrollment.

Among the newly established schools, there are two higher art normal colleges and one higher physical education normal college. These thirteen newly established schools plan to enroll a total of over 11,000 new students this summer.

The newly established Shanghai Second Normal College will set up five departments, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and geography, as well as seven specialties, including physical education, mathematics, and physics. The Xinjiang Normal College, located in Urumqi, will set up seven specialties, including ethnic languages, mathematics, and physics. The Beijing Art Normal College is being established by separating the art departments of Beijing Normal University. This school will set up two specializations, music and drawing, and will enroll junior high school graduates.

The thirteen newly established higher normal schools were recently approved by the State Council. They are distributed in eleven cities including Shijiazhuang, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Nanchang, and Hefei. After the new schools are built, the number of higher normal schools nationwide will reach fifty-three (excluding the normal departments attached to two comprehensive universities), an increase of 3.4 times compared to the twelve in the early post-liberation period.

The Ministry of Education has also approved the expansion of five schools, including Shanghai Normal College, Harbin Normal College, Shaanxi Normal College, Hebei Normal College, and Shandong Normal College, into higher normal colleges. (Xinhua News Agency)
