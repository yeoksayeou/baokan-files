The forty merchandise departments of the Wangfujing Department Store of the Beijing State-Owned Department Store Company have all implemented the "group piece-rate wage system." As of April 27th, over 60% of these merchandise departments had completed their April sales targets ahead of schedule. The children's clothing department, which had always found it difficult to meet its sales targets, also exceeded its monthly target by more than 30%.

This "group piece-rate wage system" calculates the piece-rate wage each salesperson should receive based on the group piece-rate unit price (total basic sales target of the group divided by the total basic wage of the group). When they overfulfill the commodity circulation plan, they can also receive a commission in proportion. Staff members related to the sales group, such as cashiers, commodity accountants, warehouse keepers, and purchasing agents, also receive their due wages based on the average proportion of task completion of the relevant sales group.

After the Wangfujing Department Store implemented this wage system, employees' wage income increased compared to the past, and their work enthusiasm has generally increased. Salespersons actively increase and improve the variety of goods according to customer requirements. For example, salespersons in the children's clothing department often go to other stores to observe new styles of children's clothing, and have added more than 100 new products in the past half month. The new styles of vests and undershirts proposed by salespersons in the knitwear department are very popular with customers. Salespersons not only patiently introduce products to customers and assist them in selecting goods, but also try their best to meet customer requirements. Collaboration between cashiers, warehouse keepers, and salespersons has been strengthened. Warehouse keepers proactively deliver goods to the counters, increasing the frequency of replenishment from once a day to three or four times a day. Some employees have improved their operating methods and increased work efficiency. After improving their operating methods, commodity accountants on the second floor increased their bookkeeping speed and reduced errors. (Xinhua News Agency)

    北京市王府井百货商店的好办法
　　小组计件工资制提高了职工劳动热情
    北京市国营百货公司王府井百货商店的四十个商品部，全部实行了“小组计件工资制”。到四月二十七日止，这些商品部已有60％以上提前完成了四月份销售任务，一向难于完成销售任务的儿童服装部，也超额30％多完成全月任务。
    这种“小组计件工资制”，是根据小组计件单价（全组基本销售任务定额除全组基本工资总和）计算每个售货员应得的计件工资，当他们超额完成商品流转计划时，还可以按比例得到提成。和售货小组有关的收款员、商品会计员、保管员、采购员等工作人员，也随着有关售货小组完成任务的平均比例取得应得的工资。
    王府井百货商店实行这种工资制度后，职工的工资收入都比过去多，他们的劳动热情普遍高涨。营业员主动地根据顾客的要求增加和改进商品的品种。如儿童服装部的售货员，经常到别的商店去观摩新式样童装，半个月来已增加一百多种新商品。针织部售货员拟出的背心和汗衫的新式样，很受顾客欢迎。售货员不仅耐心向顾客介绍商品协助顾客挑选商品，还想尽各种办法来满足顾客的要求。收款员、保管员和售货员之间加强了协作，保管员主动把货送到柜台上去，由过去一天补一次货增加到一天补三、四次。有的职工改进了操作方法，提高了工作效率，二楼商品会计员改进操作方法以后，提高了记账速度，并且减少了差错。（新华社）
