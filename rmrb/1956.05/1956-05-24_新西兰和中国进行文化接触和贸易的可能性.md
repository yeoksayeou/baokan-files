    Possibilities for Cultural Contact and Trade Between New Zealand and China
    Angus Ross, Professor of History, University of Otago, New Zealand, Member of the New Zealand Cultural Delegation to China
    It is difficult to imagine two countries more different than China and New Zealand. Geographically, China is a large country on the Asian continent, while New Zealand is a country in the South Pacific composed of two main islands and several smaller islands, more than 1,200 miles from its nearest neighbor, Australia. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, China is now moving towards a socialist society in accordance with the Marxist-Leninist tradition, while New Zealand is still a capitalist democracy—however, it must also be emphasized that it is a capitalist democracy that has socialized some necessary services and provides good social and welfare services to the people. China has a population of over 600 million, while New Zealand has just over 2 million residents. The Chinese people are essentially all Asian, although there are some important differences between the various ethnic minorities; the New Zealand people are divided into the Maori, numbering just over 127,000, and Europeans, mainly of British descent. China has a long history of more than 5,000 years, while the history of the Maori in New Zealand is a matter of myths and legends for antiquarians to study, no more than 1,000 years, and its European history only began in the early 19th century.

    Despite these significant differences in geography, history, and population, China and New Zealand do have some things in common. They are all independent Pacific nations with their own governments, not subordinate to any other country, although New Zealand is still a member of the Commonwealth, recognizing the Queen of the United Kingdom as the Queen of New Zealand. The seas facing all of China's important ports are actually part of the same Pacific Ocean that surrounds New Zealand. The people of both countries are anxiously hoping to see this ocean become truly "peaceful," and both sincerely desire that international peace be maintained and strengthened. The people of both countries highly value improving the living standards of workers and share the more fundamental aspirations of all mankind.

    Perhaps there has been no direct contact between New Zealand and China throughout the ages, but visitors to the museums of both countries cannot help but be surprised by the similarity in form between the Neolithic tools used in eastern China thousands of years ago and the stone tools still used by the Maori of New Zealand until the early 19th century. Our best anthropologists are convinced that there must be a connection between the material civilization of our Maori and that of the early residents of East Asia. The extent of the connection is still uncertain by experts, but definite modern cultural relations can be established. The New Zealand cultural delegation to China, which came to Beijing to attend the "May Day" celebrations, is almost certainly a precursor to such delegations. Many New Zealanders would welcome the opportunity to visit China now, and when normal relations are restored between the two countries, China can expect many guests from New Zealand. But New Zealanders do not want to see only themselves as guests: many of them would welcome a Chinese cultural delegation or a trade union delegation to visit their country. Many of them would like to see an exhibition of Chinese art or antique treasures held in their major cities. Exchanging views and gifts of beautiful cultural relics between our two countries for our people to observe and learn from will certainly increase mutual understanding and respect. From this foundation of understanding and respect will arise an even greater determination to maintain peace in the Pacific and throughout the world.

    The opening of trade relations between our two countries is likely to become a major event in the near future. In this regard, it is worth pointing out that New Zealand, despite its small population, is an important member of world trade relations. Its main industry is sheep farming: more than 36 million sheep graze on its plains and mountains, and although it is only the fourth largest sheep farming country in the world, it ranks third in the world in wool exports and firmly holds the lead in the export of mutton and lamb. Indeed, New Zealand accounts for about 75% of the world's total turnover. Each year, New Zealand slaughters approximately five million sheep and twelve million lambs for refrigerated export. New Zealand is also currently the world's largest exporter of dairy products. For example, in the most recent year—1953, New Zealand exported 159,000 tons of butter, 100,100 tons of cheese, 63,000 tons of milk powder, and 9,000 tons of casein. New Zealand also exports 40,000 tons of beef and 27,000 tons of fat annually. Obviously, New Zealand's wealth comes from its excellent pastures, which can support such large herds of cattle and sheep. New Zealand has many grass breeding experts, and its grass seeds are popular abroad.

    India is an example of a densely populated country where New Zealand's milk powder has proven helpful in hospitals and childcare. China may similarly find value in New Zealand's dairy products, and as living standards in China improve, it could provide a market for New Zealand's beef and lamb. China's demand for wool of various qualities could well be met from the New Zealand market, which has been welcomed by Japanese wool buyers for many years. Scientific research on the needs of China's open spaces in mountainous and near-desert areas may lead to the import of New Zealand grass seeds, as New Zealand has developed many varieties of high-quality pasture grass due to its diverse soil and climate conditions.

    Although imports and exports between the two countries may not be perfectly balanced at this stage of China's industrialization, certain Chinese products will find a ready market in New Zealand. The main needs of this South Pacific country are the same as China's own: it needs metals and heavy machinery, including tractors and motor vehicles. But New Zealand also needs Chinese exports such as cotton cloth, silk, brocade and other textiles, tung oil, soybean and peanut products, porcelain, cloisonné, thermos bottles and many exquisite Chinese handicrafts. In New Zealand, countless wooden houses need to be painted frequently, and the world-renowned Chinese tung oil will be able to supply this constant need, making the paint durable. The best way to make New Zealand importers aware of the nature and quality of Chinese products would be to hold an exhibition of these goods in New Zealand at an appropriate time. At the same time distributing "Foreign Trade of the People's Republic of China" published by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade will arouse interest and encourage requests for improved trade relations.

    The prospect of increasing cultural and trade relations between the two countries is almost certainly coming. Relationships cannot stand still: they must either improve or deteriorate, and few people would like the latter possibility. But if the nature and extent of the cooperation that can be achieved between our two countries remains to be determined, the prospects are bright, and many New Zealanders share the feelings expressed by Premier Zhou Enlai at the banquet for foreign guests during the "May Day" celebrations, when he said: "May our friendly exchanges become more frequent! May our peaceful cooperation be strengthened day by day!"

    新西兰和中国进行文化接触和贸易的可能性
    新西兰奥塔格大学历史教授  新西兰文化界人士访华团团员  安古斯·罗斯
    很难想像还有比中国和新西兰这样两个不相同的国家了。在地理上，中国是亚洲大陆上的一个大国，而新西兰却是南太平洋上一个由两个主岛和若干小岛组成的国家，距它最近的邻邦澳大利亚也有一千二百英里以上。在共产党的领导下，中国现在正按照马克思—列宁主义传统朝着社会主义社会前进，而新西兰还是一个资本主义民主国家——然而，也须着重指出，是一个这样的资本主义民主国家，它已经把若干必要的劳务社会化，并且给人民提供了良好的社会和福利服务。中国拥有六亿以上的人口，而新西兰却只有二百万多一点的居民。中国人民实质上全属亚洲人，虽然在各个少数民族之间有着一些重要的不同；新西兰人民却分成为数仅十二万七千多人的毛利族，和主要是英国血统的欧洲人。中国有五千多年的悠久历史，而新西兰的毛利族的历史却是一些神话和传说，供古物家们研究，也不过一千多年，而它的欧洲人的历史仅仅始于十九世纪初期。
    尽管在地理上、历史上和人口上有这些重大的差异，中国和新西兰毕竟还有一些共同之处。他们全都是有自己的政府的独立的太平洋国家，不从属于任何其他国家，虽然新西兰还是英联邦成员之一，承认联合王国的女皇为新西兰的女皇。中国的一切重要港口所面临的大海，实际上是围绕着新西兰的同一个太平洋的一部分。两国的人民都焦急地希望看到这个大洋成为名符其实的“太平”洋，都真诚渴望国际和平得到维护和巩固。两国人民都十分看重提高工人的生活水平，也都抱有全世界人类的更根本的愿望。
    历代以来，新西兰和中国之间也许没有直接的接触，但是参观这两个国家的博物馆的人，不能不对数千年前在中国东部所使用的新石器时代工具，和新西兰的毛利族人直到十九世纪初还在使用的石器工具在形式上的相似感到惊讶。我们的最优秀的人类学家们确信：在我们的毛利族的物质文明和早期的东亚居民的物质文明之间，肯定有着联系。联系的程度专家们还断不定，然而确定的现代文化关系却可以建立起来。到北京来参加“五一”节观礼的新西兰文化界人士访华团，几乎可以肯定是这种代表团的先驱。许多新西兰人将会欢迎现在来访问中国的机会，而当两国之间恢复了正常的关系的时候，中国可以期待来自新西兰的众多的宾客。但是新西兰人不愿看见光是他们自己作客：他们中间许多人会欢迎一个中国文化代表团或是工会代表团访问他们的国家。他们许多人都会喜欢看到在他们的大城市里举办一个中国艺术品或古物珍藏的展览会。我们两国之间交换意见和馈赠优美的文物样品，以供我们彼此的人民观摩和学习，肯定地只会是增加彼此的相互了解和尊重。从这种了解和尊重的基础上，将产生一种甚至比现有的更大的决心，来维护太平洋和全世界的和平。
    我们两国之间的贸易关系的开辟，在最近的将来很可能成为一件重大的事情。在这方面，值得指出的是，新西兰虽然人口稀少，却是世界贸易关系中的一个重要成员。它最主要的事业是牧羊业：在它的平原和高山上放牧着三千六百万头以上的羊，虽然它只不过是世界上第四名最大牧羊国，但是在羊毛出口上却占世界第三位，而且稳执世界的羊肉和羊羔的输出的牛耳。确实，在世界的总成交量中，新西兰占了75％左右。每年新西兰宰杀约五百万只羊和一千二百万只羊羔，冷藏输出。新西兰还是目前世界上最大的奶产品输出国。例如，在最近一年——1953年，新西兰输出了十五万九千吨黄油，十万零一千吨干酪，六万三千吨奶粉和九千吨酪素。新西兰每年还输出四万吨牛肉和二万七千吨脂肪。显而易见，新西兰的财富来自它的优美的牧草，它可供养牧这样大群的牛羊。新西兰有许多育草专家，它的草籽在国外受到欢迎。
    印度是一个人口稠密的国家的例子，在这样一个国家里，新西兰的奶粉在医院和育儿方面证明是颇有帮助的。中国可能同样地发现新西兰的奶产品的价值，而且由于中国的生活水平的提高，可以为新西兰的牛羊肉提供一个市场。中国对各种品质的羊毛的需求，很可以从新西兰的市场上得到满足，这个市场多年来大受日本的羊毛买家所欢迎。对中国在山间和接近沙漠地区的空地的需要所作的科学研究，可能导致输入新西兰的草籽，因为新西兰由于拥有各种不同的土壤与气候条件，发展了很多品种的上等牧草。
    虽然在中国实行工业化的现阶段，两国之间的进出口可能不能恰好做到平衡，然而某些中国产品会在新西兰找到现成的市场。这个南太平洋国家的主要需求跟中国自己的需求一样，它需要金属和重型机械，包括拖拉机和机动车辆。但是新西兰也需要中国的这样一些出口品：棉布、丝绸、锦缎和其它纺织品，桐油、大豆和花生产品，瓷器、景泰蓝、热水瓶和许多精致的中国手工艺品。在新西兰，无数的木屋需要经常的油刷，而世界闻名的中国桐油将能供应这方面不断的需要，它能使油漆耐久。使得新西兰入口商注意中国产品的性质和质量的最好法子，将是在适当时机在新西兰举办一个这些商品的展览会。同时，分发中国国际贸易促进会所出版的“中华人民共和国的对外贸易”将会引起兴趣，促使要求改进贸易关系。
    增进两国的文化和贸易关系的前景，几乎可以肯定正在来临。关系是不能静止不动的：它必然是在改进，或是恶化，而只有少数人会喜欢后一种可能性。但是，如果说我们两国之间所能作到的合作的性质和程度还有待决定，前景却是光明的，而许多新西兰人对周恩来总理在“五一”节招待外宾的宴会上所表达的感情有同感，他说：“愿我们的友好来往更加频繁！愿我们的和平合作日益加强！”
