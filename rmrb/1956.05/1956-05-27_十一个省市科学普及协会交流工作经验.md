Eleven Provinces and Cities' Science Popularization Associations Exchange Work Experiences

From May 20th to 22nd, the China Association for Science and Technology Popularization held a symposium on science popularization work in eleven provinces and cities in Hangzhou. Liang Xi, Chairman of the China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, attended the symposium. At the meeting, the branches of eleven provinces and cities, including Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Fujian, Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang, exchanged their experiences in science and technology popularization work. The Shanghai and Zhejiang branches introduced their experiences in carrying out scientific publicity work among factory and mine workers, and the Zhejiang Hangxian Pingyao District introduced its experience in establishing science popularization groups to carry out publicity work.

The symposium focused on discussing the issue of carrying out large-scale science and technology popularization work in factories, mines, and rural areas. The symposium believed that to carry out science popularization work among factory and mine workers, it is necessary to strengthen the establishment of cooperation plans with various factories, and include science popularization plans in the work plans of factories and mines in order to supervise and inspect; at the same time, science popularization branches and science popularization work groups should be generally established in various counties and cities.

    十一个省市科学普及协会交流工作经验
    五月二十日至二十二日，中华全国科学技术普及协会在杭州召开了十一个省、市科学普及工作座谈会。全国科学技术普及协会主席梁希出席了座谈会。会上，上海、江苏、安徽、山东、福建、湖南、湖北、广东、广西、江西、浙江等十一个省市分会交流了科学技术普及工作的经验。上海、浙江两分会介绍了在厂矿职工中开展科学宣传工作经验和浙江杭县瓶窑区建立科学普及小组开展宣传工作的经验。
    座谈会上着重讨论了在厂矿和农村中大规模地开展科学技术普及工作的问题。座谈会认为，在厂矿职工中开展科学普及工作，必须加强和各厂订立协作计划，将科学普及计划列入厂矿的工作计划中，以便督促检查；同时在各县、市普遍建立科学普及支会和科学普及工作组。
