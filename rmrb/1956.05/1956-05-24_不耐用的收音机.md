An Unreliable Radio

Last December, I bought a 5302 model radio produced by the Guangzhou People's Broadcasting Station Service Department at a department store for 133 yuan. It had long, medium, and short waves. However, the medium and short waves were simply impossible to tune in clearly. This wasn't so bad, but the worst thing was that the wavelength went out of alignment in less than a week. For example, to receive Beijing's 850 kilocycles, I sometimes had to turn the dial to the 800 kilocycle position, and sometimes to the 900 kilocycle position. After using it for more than a month, one of the indicator lights went out. One day in early May, we were listening to music when suddenly there was a flash inside the radio, and then no sound at all. Why is this radio so bad? I hope the production and sales departments will thoroughly investigate this and take effective measures to prevent such substandard products from being sold.

    不耐用的收音机
    去年十二月，我在百货公司买一架广州人民广播电台服务部出品的5302型收音机，花了一百三十三元，有长中短波。可是，中波和短波根本收不清楚。这还不要紧，最糟的是用不了一星期，波长就对不准了。如收北京的850千周，有时要转到800千周位置，有时要转到900千周位置。用了一个多月，指示灯就坏了一只。五月初的一天，我们正在收听音乐的时候，收音机里忽然一亮，什么声音也没有了。这种收音机为什么这样坏呢？希望生产部门和销售部门都好好检查一下，并且采取有效措施不让这种次品出售。　健康报　朱锡莹
