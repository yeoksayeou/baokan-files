    Cultivation Cannot Be Rough
    Wang Zhimin
    According to inspections in some areas recently, many agricultural cooperatives have been found to have rough cultivation practices. In Yangjiang County, Guangdong Province, some agricultural cooperatives plant two or three seedlings per hole, while others plant more than a dozen. In Fengfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tongshan County, Jiangsu Province, 62 out of 366 inspected corn seedlings were found to be missing. In six villages in Shulu County, Hebei Province, 140 mu of cotton fields have been sown too shallowly and have dried out, preventing seedlings from emerging. In Gaocheng County, Hebei Province, 330,000 jin of sweet potato seedlings rotted in warm beds in the third district. Rough cultivation has caused significant losses to the cooperatives. Guiding cooperatives to eliminate this phenomenon is an important task for agricultural leading organs in various regions at present.

    Some agricultural production cooperatives engage in rough cultivation because members want to earn more work points and simply try to work quickly. Therefore, to improve the quality of cultivation, the production management of agricultural cooperatives should be improved first, especially by improving the system of contracting work and output. When implementing contracting work, not only should the quantity of work be stipulated, but also the quality of work, to strengthen the members' sense of responsibility. Members should be told that rushing to work quickly and engaging in rough cultivation may seem to earn work points on the surface, but in reality, it causes reduced production, which is detrimental to both the cooperative and the individual members.

    Some agricultural cooperatives engage in rough cultivation because they have not paid attention to promoting advanced cultivation techniques and have not cultivated according to the requirements of advanced techniques. This year, many places have promoted advanced experience in increasing production. Agricultural cooperatives in these areas have many new requirements for cultivation techniques, and the quality of cultivation can be continuously improved. Agricultural cooperatives in various regions should widely carry out the work of improving cultivation techniques based on specific circumstances, so that the members of the masses can fully understand the benefits of improving cultivation techniques and can apply them specifically, and continuously improve the quality of cultivation on the basis of improving techniques.

    耕作不能粗糙
    王志民
    根据最近一些地区的检查，不少农业合作社都发生耕作粗糙的现象。广东省阳江县有些农业合作社，每穴秧苗，有的二、三株，有的十几株。江苏省铜山县丰丰农业生产合作社检查的366穴玉米苗中，就有62穴缺苗。河北省束鹿县六个村有一百四十亩棉田，因为播种过浅已经落干，不能出苗。这个省的藁城县三区进行甘薯温床育苗，霉坏种薯三十三万斤。耕作粗糙给合作社带来了很大的损失。领导合作社消除这种现象，是各地农业领导机关当前一项重要的工作。
    有些农业生产合作社耕作粗糙，是因为社员想多得工分，在做活的时候单纯图快而造成的。因此，要提高耕作质量，首先就应当改善农业合作社的生产管理工作，特别是健全包工包产制度，在实行包工的时候，不仅要规定工作数量而且要规定工作质量，以加强社员的工作责任心。应该对社员说明，抢工图快，耕作粗糙，表面挣了工分，实际造成减产，对合作社对社员个人都很不利。
    有些农业合作社耕作粗糙，是因为没有注意推广先进耕作技术，没有按照先进技术的要求进行耕作。今年很多地方都推广了先进的增产经验。这些地区的农业合作社对耕作技术就有不少新的要求，耕作质量也能不断提高。各地农业合作社应该根据具体情况，广泛开展改进耕作技术的工作，让社员群众充分了解改进耕作技术的好处，并且能够具体应用，在改进技术的基础上，不断提高耕作质量。
