Editorial:

    This summer, senior high schools and secondary vocational schools are facing a new situation in their enrollment work, namely that the planned enrollment quota exceeds the number of this year's junior middle school graduates. It is necessary to mobilize young people with a junior middle school education from all sectors to apply in order to meet this year's enrollment needs for secondary schools.

    The shortage of student sources for secondary schools this year, compared with the situation in previous years where many junior middle school graduates could not continue their education, represents a major change. Because with the rapid development of socialist construction, especially the agricultural cooperativization movement, the scale of industry, agriculture, transportation, commerce, and cultural and educational undertakings has expanded and the speed of development has accelerated, greatly increasing the need for senior and mid-level specialized personnel. For example, in order to develop agricultural production, the agricultural sector will establish many agricultural technology extension stations, animal husbandry and veterinary stations, seed stations, tractor stations, and state-owned farms throughout the country. According to preliminary plans in various provinces, more than eight thousand agricultural technology extension stations will be newly established nationwide this year. This requires a large number of cadres to participate in the work. In order to meet the needs of all sectors, the enrollment quotas for senior high schools and secondary vocational schools have increased significantly this year. This year, high schools plan to enroll 366,000 students, an increase of more than 140,000 over last year, and secondary vocational schools plan to enroll 444,000 students, an increase of more than 255,000 over last year. The two types of schools will enroll a total of 810,000 students, while there are less than 800,000 junior middle school graduates this year. If we exclude a portion of people who cannot apply for various reasons, or who apply but are not admitted, this year's junior middle school graduates are far from sufficient to meet the enrollment needs. In addition, many departments, due to the needs of production and construction, also require a large number of junior middle school graduates to train them as junior technicians, professional cadres, skilled workers, apprentices, etc. According to statistics from the Ministry of Labor, the number of junior middle school graduates that various central ministries have applied to recruit has reached 300,000. In this way, the source of junior middle school graduates is even more insufficient.

    School education must serve the national economic construction, and the pace of development of education must keep up with the progress of national economic construction, in order to train a sufficient number of cadres to meet the needs of all sectors, and correspondingly improve the people's cultural level. Senior high school graduates are the most important source of students for institutions of higher learning. Only with a large-scale development of senior high schools can the student source for institutions of higher learning be guaranteed, can the quality of new students be improved, and can qualified senior construction talents be cultivated. The focus of secondary vocational schools is to train technical cadres, management cadres, and primary school teachers for industry and agriculture. Article 28 of the "National Agricultural Development Outline (Draft) from 1956 to 1967" stipulates that, starting this year, within twelve years, agricultural departments at all levels will be responsible for training 5 to 6 million junior and mid-level technical cadres in agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, production management, and accounting for agricultural production cooperatives. Article 39 stipulates that, starting this year, primary school compulsory education will be universalized within seven or twelve years, depending on local conditions, and the number of teachers needed for primary schools in the future will also increase year by year. Therefore, ensuring the completion of this year's enrollment tasks for senior high schools and secondary vocational schools is of great significance for the country to train talents in a planned way and for the country's socialist construction.

    In order to ensure the completion of this year's enrollment tasks for secondary schools, all localities should take active measures to expand the scope of enrollment and the source of students; at the same time, the recruitment and allocation of this year's junior middle school graduates should also be planned and controlled appropriately.

    The main method of expanding the student source is to mobilize junior middle school graduates from previous years who have not yet continued their education or found employment, as well as educated youth with a junior middle school education in state organs, enterprises, and rural areas to apply. It is understood that there are approximately 200,000 educated youth with a junior middle school education in society. Local educational administrative organs and the Communist Youth League should publicize this to these educated youth and their parents, and they can prepare to set up cram schools, similar to the methods used for this year's enrollment in institutions of higher learning, to help them make up their lessons. In some areas, if there are self-study organizations, the guidance and organization of their self-study should be strengthened, and various preparations should be made before the application. State organs and enterprises should support the educated youth in their units to apply.

    Due to the shortage of student sources, this year's junior middle school graduates and previous year's junior middle school graduates should first satisfy the enrollment needs of senior high schools, and secondly satisfy the enrollment needs of secondary vocational schools. As for the junior middle school graduates needed by various departments to train junior technicians, professional cadres, etc., except for those recruited with the approval of the State Council, they should all be resolved from the surplus junior middle school graduates after the enrollment of senior high schools and secondary vocational schools, and should be uniformly allocated by the competent authorities. The junior middle school graduates already recruited by various departments should be trained as students of worker technical schools or as professional cadres. Trainees and apprentices for technical worker training classes recruited by various departments should recruit graduates of higher primary schools and young workers with equivalent qualifications. This is done for the country to train cadres in a planned way, and various departments should proceed from the overall and long-term interests and oppose departmentalism.

    Now that the enrollment dates are approaching, all localities should seize the time to do a good job in the organization and publicity mobilization work before enrollment. The broad masses of educated youth should conscientiously make up their lessons and actively apply.

### 动员初中毕业程度的青年报考学校

    动员初中毕业程度的青年报考学校
    今年暑期，高级中学和中等专业学校的招生工作，遇到了一种新的情况，就是计划招生名额超过了今年初级中学应届毕业生的人数。必须动员各方面具有初中毕业程度的青年报考，才能满足今年中等学校的招生需要。
    今年中等学校学生来源不足的情况，同往年许多初中毕业生不能升学的情况相比，是一个很大的变化。因为随着社会主义建设事业、特别是农业合作化运动的迅速发展，工业、农业、交通运输、商业以及文化教育事业的规模扩大了，发展速度加快了，所需要的高级和中级专门人才大大增加了。例如为了发展农业生产，农业部门将在全国新建许多农业技术推广站、畜牧兽医工作站、种籽站、拖拉机站、国营农场等。根据各省初步计划，今年内全国就要新建立八千多个农业技术推广站。这就需要有大批的干部参加工作。为了适应各方面的需要，今年高中、中等专业学校的招生名额大大增加了。今年高中计划招生三十六万六千人，比去年增加了十四万多人，中等专业学校招生四十四万四千人，比去年增加了二十五万五千多人。两类学校共招生八十一万人，而今年应届初中毕业生却不到八十万人，如果除去一部分人因为各种原因不能报考，或者报考不能录取的以外，本届初中毕业生是远远不敷招生的需要的。此外，许多部门由于生产建设的需要，也要求大量招收初中毕业生，以便培养他们成为初级技术人员、专业干部、技术工人、学徒等。据劳动部统计，中央各部申请招收初中毕业生的人数已经达到三十万人。这样，初中毕业生的来源更感不足。
    学校教育要为国家经济建设事业服务，教育事业发展的步调必须赶上国家经济建设事业的进度，以培养足够数量的干部，满足各方面的需要，并且相应地提高人民的文化水平。高中毕业生是高等学校学生的最主要的来源，只有高中有了大量的发展，高等学校的学生来源才有保证，才能提高新生的质量，培养合乎标准的高级建设人才。中等专业学校的重点是培养工业、农业的技术干部、管理干部和小学教师。“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要”（草案）第二十八条规定，从今年开始，在十二年内，各级农业部门分别负责为农业生产合作社训练农、林、水利、畜牧、兽医、生产管理和会计等初级和中级技术干部五百到六百万人。第三十九条规定，从今年开始，按照各地情况，分别在七年或者十二年内普及小学义务教育，今后小学需要的教师数量也将逐年增大。因此，保证完成今年高中、中等专业学校的招生任务，对于国家有计划地培养人才，对于国家的社会主义建设事业是有重大意义的。
    为了保证完成今年中等学校的招生任务，各地应当采取积极措施，扩大招生范围和学生来源；同时，对于今年初中毕业生的招考和分配，也应当加以通盘筹划和适当控制。
    扩大学生来源的主要方法，是动员往年初中毕业而至今尚未升学和就业的学生，以及国家机关、企业和农村中具有初中程度的知识青年报考。据了解，社会上具有初中程度的知识青年大约有二十万人，各地教育行政机关、青年团应当向这些知识青年和他们的家长进行宣传，并且可以仿照今年高等学校招生的办法，筹备设立补习班，帮助他们补习功课；有些地区有自学组织的，应当加强对他们自学的辅导和组织领导，做好报考前的各种准备。国家机关、企业单位应当支持本单位的知识青年报考。
    由于学生来源不足，今年应届初中毕业生和往年初中毕业生应当首先满足高中招生的需要，其次满足中等专业学校的招生需要。至于各部门培养初级技术人员、专业干部等所需要的初中毕业生，除了经过国务院批准招生的以外，都应当在高中、中等专业学校招生后多余的初中毕业生当中解决，并由主管部门统一分配。各部门已经招收到的初中毕业生，应当作为工人技术学校的学员或作为专业干部来培养。各部门招收技术工人训练班的学员和学徒，应当招收高小毕业和具有相当程度的青年工人。这样做是为了国家有计划地培养干部，各部门应当从整体利益和长远利益出发，反对本位主义。
    现在，招生日期已经迫近，各地应当抓紧时间，做好招生前的组织和宣传动员工作。广大的知识青年应当认真补习功课，踊跃报考。
