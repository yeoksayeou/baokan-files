Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 3rd. The Indian National Development Council held its seventh meeting on May 1st and 2nd. At the meeting on May 2nd, the draft outline of India's Second Five-Year Plan was approved. At the close of the meeting, the committee called on the nation to strive for the successful implementation of the plan.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered the opening address at the meeting on May 1st, saying that, in general, the basic policy of India's Second Five-Year Plan is to industrialize the country as quickly as possible. He said:

"Because we believe that, in terms of wealth creation and employment, and even in terms of whether our country can maintain its freedom, there can be no real progress without the development of industry. This is the basic policy we emphasize. We have seen this before, but we have not emphasized it as much."

Regarding the issue of employment, Nehru said, "I do think we will make great progress within a decade, but how successful we will be in completely solving this problem is another matter. Even in this five-year plan that we are presenting to you, we actually talk very little about the so-called existing unemployed." He said that the entire purpose of the plan is to maintain a planned rate of progress.

Nehru said that just as the First Five-Year Plan focused on food production, the Second Five-Year Plan must continue to give great importance to food production. He said: "In a sense, the entire plan depends on whether food is relatively abundant and whether food prices are not high."

According to a report in the "Hindustan Times" on May 2nd, the Indian National Development Council approved the plan to invest 48 billion rupees in the public sector during the Second Five-Year Plan, and believes that the 4 billion rupees of "uncovered" gap between the investment plan and the initial estimate of financial resources can be made up through additional taxes, savings, and public debt from the central and provincial (state) governments.

According to the "Indian Express" on May 2nd, the National Development Council agreed that food production should increase by 40% by 1960-1961, instead of the originally stipulated 15% increase. The committee mentioned the high agricultural targets that China is adopting at the meeting. An agreement has been reached that the Planning Commission and the Ministry of Food and Agriculture should consult with the respective provinces (states) to take steps to achieve higher targets.

Nehru said at the close of the meeting that the Planning Commission will soon send a seven-member delegation of officials to China to study the activities of Chinese cooperatives.

　　印度国家开发委员会通过第二个五年计划大纲
　　并决定派代表团来我国研究合作社活动情况
    新华社新德里3日电　印度国家开发委员会在五月一日和二日举行了第七次会议。会议在五月二日通过了印度的第二个五年计划的大纲草案。委员会在会议结束时号召全国努力胜利地执行这个计划。
    印度总理尼赫鲁五月一日在会议上致开会词说：总的来说，印度第二个五年计划的基本方针是尽快使国家工业化。他说：
  “因为我们认为，从财富的形成和就业来看，甚至从我国是否能够维持它的自由来看，工业若不发达，就不能够有真正的进步。这就是我们所强调的基本方针。以前我们也看到了这一点，但是，我们没有这么强调它。”
    关于就业问题，尼赫鲁说：“我的确认为我们将在十年的期间内取得很大的进展，但是，我们在彻底解决这个问题的方面到底能得到多大的成功，那是另一回事。甚至在我们向你们提出的这个五年计划中，我们也实际上很少谈到所谓原有失业者的问题”。他说，计划的整个目的是要保持有计划的进展速度。
    尼赫鲁说，正如第一个五年计划中着重于粮食生产一样，在第二个五年计划中，也必须继续对粮食生产予以极大的重视。他说：“在某一种意义上说来，整个计划取决于粮食是否比较充裕，粮食的价格是否不高。”
    据“印度斯坦时报”五月二日报道，印度国家开发委员会赞成第二个五年计划期间在公营部分投资四百八十亿卢比的计划，并且认为，投资计划和对财源的初步估计之间的四十亿卢比的“尚未弥补”的差额可以通过中央和省（邦）的额外税收、储蓄和公债来补足。
    另据五月二日的“印度快报”说，国家开发委员会赞成粮食生产到1960—1961年度应当增加40％的建议，而不是本来规定的增加15％。委员会在会议中提到了中国正在采用的高度的农业指标。已经取得协议，计划委员会和粮食和农业部应当同各别的省（邦）商议采取达到更高的指标的步骤。
    尼赫鲁在会议结束时说，计划委员会不久将派一个七人官员代表团去中国，研究中国的合作社的活动情况。
