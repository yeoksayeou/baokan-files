    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 11th. Trial production of the first 12,000 kilowatt steam turbine generator has begun.

    The chief process engineer of the state-owned Shanghai Electric Machinery Plant, who is responsible for the trial production of the 12,000 kilowatt steam turbine generator, accompanied Xinhua News Agency reporters on a tour of the shearing and punching workshop, where materials were first put into production. At a huge gantry punch press, advanced worker Zhu Jinbao was punching the stator silicon steel sheets for the 12,000 kilowatt steam turbine generator.

    Production preparations, which began three months ago, are now nearing completion. By mid-May, many parts and components marked with the words "12,000 kW" will be visible in the main processing workshops. The chief process engineer told reporters: Because of the experience in manufacturing 6,000 kilowatt and 2,500 kilowatt steam turbine generators, the workers are confident that they will complete the trial production of the first 12,000 kilowatt steam turbine generator ahead of schedule by the end of September as a gift for National Day.

    This largest steam turbine generator made in China is being trial-produced based on Soviet blueprints. The design work was carried out by the factory's designers under the guidance of Czechoslovak experts.

    试制一万二千瓩汽轮发电机
    新华社上海11日电　第一台一万二千瓩汽轮发电机已经开始制造。
    国营上海电机厂负责试制一万二千瓩汽轮发电机的主任工艺师，陪同新华社记者参观了最先投料的剪冲车间。在一台巨大的龙门冲床上，先进工作者朱金宝在冲制一万二千瓩汽轮发电机的定子矽钢片。
    三个月以前开始的生产准备工作，现在已经接近完成。五月中旬，在各个主要加工车间里就可以看到标着一万二千瓩字样的许多部件和零件了。主任工艺师告诉记者：因为有了制造六千瓩和二千五百瓩汽轮发电机的经验，职工们保证在今年九月底作为国庆节的献礼，提前完成第一台一万二千瓩汽轮发电机的试制任务。
    这一台中国自制的最大的汽轮发电机，是根据苏联的图纸试制的。设计工作，是这个厂的设计师们在捷克斯洛伐克专家的指导之下进行的。
