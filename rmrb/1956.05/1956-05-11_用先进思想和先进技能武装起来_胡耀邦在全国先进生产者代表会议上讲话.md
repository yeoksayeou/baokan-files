    "To become an advanced producer and an advanced worker, one must first possess the advanced thinking of an advanced producer and an advanced worker." This was stated by Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, at the National Conference of Advanced Producers' Representatives on the 9th.
    Hu Yaobang pointed out that so-called advanced thinking is not some unattainable, mysterious thing. As can be seen from this conference, advanced thinking includes these four aspects: First, even the smallest and dirtiest jobs that others are unwilling to do, as long as they are beneficial to the people, should not be rejected and should be willingly undertaken. Because in our country, any labor is an indispensable part of the entire social labor, and every profession can produce an "expert." Second, as long as it is beneficial to the people and socialism, one should never be discouraged in the face of any difficulties, obstacles, grievances, or setbacks, but should be able to bravely and tenaciously overcome and defeat them. Third, in order to contribute to socialism, one should never be complacent or arrogant, but always feel that one knows too little and has not done enough; one should be able to learn humbly and make continuous progress. Fourth, one should never hide one's own advantages and advanced experiences as a "family secret recipe" at any time or place, and should not adopt a cold attitude towards those who are not as good as oneself, but should be able to sincerely lead those around oneself to advance together.
    Hu Yaobang continued by saying that among the broad masses of young people, there are still many who have not grasped the above-mentioned advanced thinking. Some young people support socialism, but are unwilling to actively build socialism. They say that so many people are working for socialism, why should I work so hard? Some young people say that there are many ways to build socialism, why not do big things but do small things, why not occupy popular fields but occupy unpopular fields, why abandon a relatively comfortable environment and run to difficult places? Still other young people say that being an advanced producer is good, but I just can't be one. I neither fall behind nor run forward; I'll just stay in the middle. These thoughts of these young comrades are the first obstacle hindering them from becoming advanced producers and advanced workers. Therefore, Hu Yaobang requested that everyone's advanced thinking be widely disseminated among the youth of the country.
    Hu Yaobang also said that for young people to become advanced producers and advanced workers, advanced thinking alone is not enough. On the road for young people to strive to become advanced producers and advanced workers, there is a second obstacle, which is the low level of technical and cultural knowledge. Therefore, to become advanced producers and advanced workers, young comrades must simultaneously arm themselves with advanced thought and advanced skills.
    Hu Yaobang said that to fully master modern technology, it is also necessary to study scientific knowledge and improve cultural standards. With a higher cultural level and useful scientific knowledge, not only can the progress of mastering operating technology be accelerated, but one can also be guided to advance towards the path of fully mastering the science and technology of one's own profession. Regarding this issue, he particularly emphasized the importance of doing a good job in production and work during working hours and doing a good job in learning during leisure time. He said that if we can achieve both proficient operating technology and rich scientific and cultural knowledge, then we can proudly say that it is in our generation that we will completely end the era of backward technology in our motherland.

    用先进思想和先进技能武装起来
    胡耀邦在全国先进生产者代表会议上讲话
    “要成为一个先进生产者和先进工作者，首先就必须具有先进生产者和先进工作者的那种先进的思想。”这是中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记胡耀邦在九日的全国先进生产者代表会议上说的。
    胡耀邦指出，所谓先进的思想，并不是什么高不可及的神秘的东西。从这次会议中可以看出，先进的思想，有这么四条：第一，哪怕是最小的、最脏的别人不愿意做的工作，只要对人民有利，都不拒绝，都乐意地担当起来。因为在我们的国家里，任何劳动都是整个社会劳动的不可缺少的一部分，行行都可以出“状元”。第二，只要对人民有利，只要对社会主义有利，决不在任何困难、任何艰难险阻、任何委曲、任何挫折面前垂头丧气，而能够勇敢地、顽强地去克服它，战胜它。第三，为了对社会主义作出贡献，任何时候都不自满，不骄傲，总是觉得自己懂得太少，做得不够；能够虚心学习，不断进步。第四，随时随地都不把自己的优点和先进经验当作“祖传秘方”隐藏起来，对不如自己的人不采取冷淡的态度，能够诚心诚意地带动周围的人共同前进。
    胡耀邦接着说，在广大青年中，现在还有不少的人没有掌握到上述的这种先进思想。有的青年虽然拥护社会主义，可是不愿意积极地去建设社会主义，他们说社会主义有这么多人干，我何必要这样卖力呢？有的青年说，建设社会主义的门道多得很，为什么大事不干干小事，热门不占占冷门，为什么要丢开比较舒适的环境而跑到困难的地方去？还有的青年说，先进生产者好是好，我就是当不了，我既不落在后，也不向前跑，不前不后站在中间就拉倒。这些青年同志的这些想法，就是阻碍他们成为先进生产者和先进工作者的第一道障碍。因此胡耀邦要求把大家的先进思想广泛地传播到全国青年中去。
    胡耀邦还说，青年人要成为先进生产者和先进工作者，光有先进思想是不够的。青年人在争取成为先进生产者和先进工作者的道路上，还有第二道障碍，这就是技术文化水平不高。因此青年同志要成为先进生产者和先进工作者，就必须同时用先进的思想和先进的技能把自己武装起来。
    胡耀邦说，要全面地掌握现代化的技术，还必须学习科学知识和提高文化水平。有了较高的文化水平和有用的科学知识，不但可以加速掌握操作技术的进度，还可以引导自己朝着完全精通本行本业的科学技术的道路前进。关于这个问题，他特别强调在作业时间里搞好生产和工作、在业余时间里搞好学习的重要性。他说，如果我们做到了既有熟练的操作技术，又有丰富的科学文化知识，那我们就可以自豪地说，是在我们这一代手上，把祖国的技术落后的时代完全结束了。
