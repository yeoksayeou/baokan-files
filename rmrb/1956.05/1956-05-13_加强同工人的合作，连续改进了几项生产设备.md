Strengthening Cooperation with Fellow Workers, Continuously Improving Several Production Equipments

To the Editor:

I am an assistant engineer at the No. 1 Blooming Mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, currently serving as a section chief. Together with my fellow workers, I have continuously improved several kinds of production equipment. Last year, Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Steel Plant and No. 1 Blooming Mill were simultaneously producing and undergoing reconstruction, which presented many difficulties in completing tasks. My coworker, Comrade Zhu Shoukuan, and I studied and改造 (gaizao, "transform") the charging machine, creating favorable conditions for the early completion of the comprehensive reconstruction project and potentially generating 3.32 million yuan in wealth for the country in production. In the two months from December last year to January this year, I also collaborated with均热炉 (junre lu, "soaking pit") worker Lü Zhengkai to successfully test and comprehensively推广 (tuiguang, "promote") the automatic liquid slag discharge method with fire sealing of the soaking pit. This completely eliminated disasters such as slag water burns and explosions during the slag removal process, saved the labor of twenty-one slag removal workers, and saved the country 4,200 tons of焦粉 (jiaofen, "coke powder") annually while producing an extra 95,760 tons of steel. Recently, I also plan to work with electrical workers and technicians to study and create a steel ingot interval time recorder during the steel rolling process using ordinary timing electricity meters, in order to identify weaknesses in our work at any time and increase hourly output.

In the process of researching and improving equipment, I have fully realized the high wisdom of the working masses; if I were to leave their assistance, I would not be able to accomplish anything. Take the transformation of the charging machine as an example: I once spent a great deal of effort and came up with a reasonable improvement plan to shorten the large rod and increase the stroke, but I could not solve the limitation of the rotating ratchet of the charging machine, which put the problem on hold. Later, I sought the opinions of the workers on this matter, and the charging machine team leader, Comrade Zhu Shoukuan, suggested installing the ratchet as a movable one, which completely completed the work of改造 (gaizao, "transforming") the charging machine. The Party educates engineering and technical personnel to combine with the workers. The achievements I have made are the result of combining with the workers. In the future, in addition to doing the work that should be done in daily production, I will further learn from the working masses, actively put forward rationalization proposals, and provide the greatest assistance to the rationalization proposals put forward by the workers.

    加强同工人的合作，连续改进了几项生产设备编辑同志：
    我是鞍山钢铁公司第一初轧厂的助理工程师，现在担任着工段长的职务。我和工人同志们一起，连续改进了几种生产设备。去年鞍钢第一炼钢厂和第一初轧厂一面生产、一面改建，要完成任务有着不少困难；我和工人祝守宽同志就一起研究，改造了装入机，给全面改建工程的提前完成创造了有利条件，在生产上能给国家多创造332万元的财富。在去年十二月到今年一月的两个月时间里，我又和均热炉的工人吕正凯一起试验成功并且全面推广了均热炉火封口自动液体出渣的办法，这就彻底消除了在清渣过程中渣水烫人和爆炸等灾害事故，节省了二十一个清炉工的劳动力，并且使国家每年节约四千二百吨焦粉和多烧95，760吨钢。最近，我还准备和电器工人、技术人员研究，利用普通计时电表，制作轧钢过程中钢锭间隔时间记录器，以便随时能找出工作中的弱点，来提高小时产量。
    在我研究改进设备的过程中，我充分地体会到工人群众的高度智慧；如果我离开了他们的帮助，就会什么也做不成。拿改造装入机来说吧，我曾经花费了很大的精力，也想出了把大挺改短和加大行程的合理改进办法，但始终解决不了装入机回转牙盘的限制，使问题搁了下来；后来我把这件事拿去征求工人的意见，装入机班长祝守宽同志就提出把牙盘装成活动的，这样就把改造装入机的工作彻底完成了。党教育工程技术人员要和工人结合，我所取得的一些成就就是同工人结合的结果。我今后除了作好日常生产应作的工作外，还要更进一步地向工人群众学习，积极提合理化建议，同时对工人提出的合理化建议给予最大的帮助。
