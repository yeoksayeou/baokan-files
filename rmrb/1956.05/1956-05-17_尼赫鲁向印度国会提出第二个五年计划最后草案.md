Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 16th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru presented the final draft of the Second Five-Year Plan to the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha of the Indian Parliament on May 15th.

The final draft, presented after three months of discussions by various parties, is basically the same as the original draft, except for some minor revisions. The public sector remains at 48 billion rupees, while investment in the private sector has increased from 23 billion rupees in the original draft to 24 billion rupees. This plan gives the highest priority to industrialization, especially the development of basic industries. In the final draft, the funds provided for large-scale industries, including mining, are 6.9 billion rupees, and the funds provided for rural and small-scale industries are 2 billion rupees, together accounting for 18.5% of the public sector funds. The plan stipulates large-scale development of transportation, with an expenditure of 9 billion rupees for railways, accounting for approximately 19%. The draft stipulates that the total expenditure for transportation and communication accounts for 28.9%.

In addition, among all the appropriations, the expenses for agriculture and rural development plans account for 11.8%; irrigation and power account for 19%; social services account for 19.7%; and other aspects account for 2.1%.

The draft plan aims to increase India's national income and expand employment opportunities during the Second Five-Year Plan period (1956 to 1961). The draft stipulates providing possible opportunities for the weak and those in the Indian population who do not enjoy basic rights, and balancing the development of various parts of the country.

The draft stipulates that 40 billion rupees of the funds for implementing the Five-Year Plan will be raised domestically, and the remaining 8 billion rupees will be "raised from foreign sources." The Planning Commission's report states that if the required foreign sources cannot be obtained, then the increase in consumption must be limited.

When presenting this draft, Nehru emphasized that the Five-Year Plan should be coordinated with a long-term vision plan. He said that when formulating the Five-Year Plan, a fifteen-year or twenty-year vision must be taken into account. He said that it is not to say that the Second Five-Year Plan will produce a socialist pattern. It will take several Five-Year Plans to achieve such a society. We can move closer to it step by step along this path.

This final draft will be discussed by four committees of the Indian Parliament, and the Lok Sabha will hold a plenary session on May 23 to begin the debate.

    尼赫鲁向印度国会提出第二个五年计划最后草案
    新华社新德里16日电　印度总理尼赫鲁在五月十五日向国会人民院和联邦院提出了第二个五年计划的最后草案。
    经过三个月各方面的讨论以后提出的这个最后草案，除一些小修正以外，基本上同原来的草案一样。公营部分保留为四百八十亿卢比，私营方面的投资从原来草案的二百三十亿卢比增加到二百四十亿卢比。这个计划给予工业化以最大的优先地位，特别是发展基本工业。在最后草案中，为包括矿业在内的大规模工业所提供的款项是六十九亿卢比，为农村工业和小规模工业提供的款项是二十亿卢比，合起来共占公营部分款项的18.5％。这个计划规定大规模发展交通事业，用于铁路的开支是九十亿卢比，约占19％。草案规定用于交通和通讯的总额共占28.9％。
    此外，在全部的拨款中，农业和乡村发展计划的费用占11.8％；灌溉和动力占19％；社会服务占19.7％；其他各方面占2.1％。
    草案计划在第二个五年计划期间（1956到1961年）提高印度国民收入和扩大就业机会。草案规定为贫弱者和印度人民中未享有基本权利的那一部人提供可能的机会，并且平衡国家各地的发展。
    草案规定实行五年计划的资金中四百亿卢比在国内筹措，其余八十亿卢比“从国外的来源筹措”。计划委员会的报告说，如果所需要的国外的来源不能来到，那么就必须限制消费的增加。
    尼赫鲁在提出这个草案时，强调要使五年计划配合一个远景计划。他说，在制定五年计划时，必须考虑到十五年或二十年的远景。他说，并不是说第二个五年计划就能产生社会主义的式样。将需要实行好几个五年计划才能实现那样的社会。我们可以朝着这个路线一步步走近它。
    这个最后草案将由印度国会的四个委员会加以讨论，人民院将在五月二十三日举行全体会议开始辩论。
