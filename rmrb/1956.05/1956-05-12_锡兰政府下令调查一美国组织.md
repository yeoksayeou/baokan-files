    Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, May 10th: The Ceylon government has ordered an investigation into the activities of the "Asia Foundation Committee." This committee is an American organization formerly known as the "Committee for Free Asia," which spends large sums of money on youth movements and other activities in Ceylon.
    The report states that this committee is nominally a non-political welfare group, but it is generally considered to be the "fifth column" of the Manila Pact organization. Sources say that with the permission of the former Ceylon Prime Minister Kotelawala's United National Party, the committee's activities are mainly concentrated in some specially selected political areas. (The "Asia Foundation Committee" is banned from operating in India.)

    锡兰政府下令调查一美国组织
    新华社10日讯　科伦坡消息：锡兰政府已经下令调查“亚洲基金委员会”的活动。这个委员会是一个美国组织，从前名为“自由亚洲委员会”，它以大笔的钱花在锡兰的青年运动等方面。
    消息说，这个委员会名义上是一个非政治性的福利团体，但是一般认为它是马尼拉条约组织的“第五纵队”。有消息说，在锡兰前总理科特拉瓦拉的统一国民党的许可下，这个委员会的活动主要集中在一些特别选定的政治范围内。（“亚洲基金委员会”在印度是被禁止活动的。）
