    Processing Surplus Oilseeds for Farmers

    Recently, Changtu, Xinmin, Andong, and other counties in Liaoning Province have been actively processing and exchanging surplus oilseeds for farmers. This not only expands the raw material sources for the oil pressing industry but also avoids waste caused by farmers processing the surplus oilseeds themselves.

    Based on the principle of "the state neither profits nor loses, and farmers are voluntary," these counties have determined the processing and exchange ratios for various beans. Furthermore, according to the needs of the farmers, they provide oil for oil and cake for cake. If the farmers do not want the oil or cake, they can sell it to the state if they wish. Exchange locations are conveniently located at nearby oil pressing factories or grain purchasing and selling stations in each district. Farmers generally say this is a great practice, as it prevents the waste of beans and provides oil for consumption.

    According to investigations in Changtu and other counties, in addition to public grain, state purchases, and consumption by farmers, the remaining soybeans in rural areas account for about one-tenth of the annual output. The situation is roughly the same in other oilseed-producing areas. Therefore, the practice of actively processing and exchanging surplus oilseeds for farmers is worth promoting.

    替农民加工剩余油料
    最近，辽宁省的昌图、新民、安东等县，积极为农民加工兑换剩余油料，既能扩大榨油工业的原料来源，又可以避免因农民自行处理剩余油料所造成的浪费。
    这些县本着“国家不赔不赚，农民自愿”的原则，确定了各种豆的加工兑换比例；并且根据农民需要，要油给油，要饼给饼，农民不要的油或饼，愿卖给国家也可以。兑换地点在附近榨油工厂或各区粮食购销站都行。农民普遍说这样做法太好了，不浪费豆子，还有油吃。
    据昌图等县调查，农村的大豆，除交公粮、国家征购和农民食用以外，剩下来的约占年产量的十分之一。其它生产油料的地方也大致相同。所以，积极为农民加工兑换剩余油料的作法是值得推广的。
