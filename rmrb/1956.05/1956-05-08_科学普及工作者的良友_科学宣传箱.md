A Good Friend of Science Popularization Workers - The Science Propaganda Box

　　A batch of boxes containing various science propaganda materials were shipped from Beijing to various science popularization associations on the 6th. These are the first two types of science propaganda boxes produced by the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization: "Electricity and its Applications" and "Our Body."

　　A science popularization worker can obtain everything he needs to popularize scientific knowledge from the science propaganda box: demonstration instruments, models, slides, wall charts, lecture scripts, and reference materials.

　　Take from the "Electricity and its Applications" box a AC-DC generator with a volume of less than one cubic foot. After shaking it by hand, it can immediately generate electricity, which can quickly rotate a small four-volt motor. In this box, there are also cat skin, bakelite rods, and foil electroscopes for experimenting with frictional electricity generation; Lenz's law instruments for experimenting with electromagnetic induction phenomena, as well as electric bells, compasses and other demonstration instruments, as well as a manuscript, three reference materials, two sets of slides, and a set of wall charts. These science propaganda boxes are only about two or three cubic feet in volume, making them relatively easy to carry, and are particularly suitable for use in rural areas.

　　科学普及工作者的良友——科学宣传箱
    一批装着各种科学宣传品的箱子，六日从北京运往各地科普协会。这是中华全国科学技术普及协会制作的第一批两种科学宣传箱：“电和电的应用”和“我们的身体”。
    一个科学普及工作者可以从科学宣传箱里得到他普及科学知识所需要的一切东西：表演仪器、模型、幻灯片、挂图、讲演稿和参考资料等。
    从“电和电的应用”这只箱子里取出一架体积不到一立方尺的交直流发电机，用手摇动后，便立刻可以发出电流，它可以使一只四伏特的小电动机迅速地转动。在这只箱子里，还有实验摩擦生电的猫皮、胶木棒和箔片验电器；有实验电磁感应现象的楞次定律仪器，还有电铃、磁针等表演仪器以及一份讲稿、三份参考资料、两套幻灯片和一套挂图。这些科学宣传箱的体积不过二、三立方尺左右，携带比较方便，特别适宜在农村中应用。
