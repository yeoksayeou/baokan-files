Moscow, May 8th (By Our Correspondent) - As spring has just stepped onto Soviet soil, spring sowing has immediately become the overriding and central task for all Soviet agricultural workers. Spring sowing has now begun in thirteen republics. According to statistics up to May 5th, collective farms and state farms throughout the Soviet Union have sown 54.2 million hectares of spring crops, 5.3 million hectares more than in the same period last year.

Although spring arrived late in many places, the speed of spring sowing throughout the Soviet Union still exceeded that of last year. In the Mikhailovsky District of the Altai Territory, which is guaranteed to harvest approximately 8 million poods of grain in the first year of the new Five-Year Plan, more than half of the spring sowing work was completed within a few days.

In order to increase grain yields, all possible efforts are being made to increase the sown area. This year, the country has sown 6 million hectares more of grain and legume crops than last year.

The sowing of maize is mainly carried out in the south. As of May 5th, nearly 3 million hectares have been sown. In the republics of Central Asia, the sowing of cotton is nearing completion. Two-thirds of the Soviet Union's sugar beet sowing plan has been completed. The sowing of flax, hemp, root crops, and pasture grasses is in progress.

Adequate preparation is an important factor in the faster progress of this year's spring sowing. A long time before the start of spring sowing in many collective farms, concrete measures were formulated to improve the quality of field work, paying special attention to the preparation of seeds and fertilizers, as well as the promotion of the experience of advanced workers.

Now the spring sowing work is at its most intense stage, and tractors are running non-stop in the fields day and night. Soviet agricultural workers are in high spirits, determined to make the first year of the Sixth Five-Year Plan a bumper year.

    苏联春播工作的速度超过去年
    本报莫斯科8日电  春天刚跨上苏联的国土，春播工作马上就成为全苏农业劳动者的压倒一切的中心任务。现在春播已经在十三个加盟共和国展开了。截至五月五日的统计，全苏集体农庄和国营农场已经播种了五千四百二十万公顷春季作物，比去年同期多播种了五百三十万公顷。
    许多地方春天来得晚，但是全苏春播工作的速度仍然超过了去年。在阿尔泰边疆区的一个保证要在新五年计划第一年收获约八百万普特粮食的米哈依洛夫区里，几天之内就完成了春播工作的一半以上。
    为了提高谷物收获量，各地都尽一切可能增加播种面积。今年全国比去年多播种了六百万公顷的谷物和豆类作物。
    玉蜀黍的播种工作主要在南方进行，到五月五日为止，已播种了近三百万公顷。中亚细亚各共和国棉花的播种工作已接近结束。全苏甜菜的播种计划已完成三分之二。亚麻、大麻、块根植物和牧草的播种工作正在进行。
    准备工作的充分是今年春播工作进展较快的一个重要因素。在许多集体农庄的春播工作开始前较长一段时间里，就拟订了提高田间工作质量的具体的措施，特别注意准备种籽和肥料，以及推广先进工作者的经验。
    现在春播工作正处在最紧张的阶段，无论白天或黑夜，拖拉机不停地在田野奔驰。苏联农业劳动者情绪高昂，他们决心要把第六个五年计划的第一年变成丰收的年份。
