    Tenth Anniversary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany
    Otto Grotewohl, Member of the Political Bureau of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic
    Editor's Note: This article was written for this newspaper by Comrade Grotewohl specifically to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. Although we received it after the anniversary date, this article still has its great significance. This article provides a thorough explanation of the glorious leading role played by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in the great and fruitful struggle of the working people of the German Democratic Republic to build socialism and strive for peace and the reunification of Germany, as well as the policy guidelines of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany at the current stage.
    The tenth anniversary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany is ten years of arduous and sacrificial struggle for the interests of the people, the nation, and society. In these ten years, our Party, in close alliance with the peasants and all other working people of the German Democratic Republic, has moved from achievement to achievement, from victory to victory. But the prerequisite for achieving all achievements and victories was the establishment of the unity of the working class and the merger of our Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party into the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. April 21, 1946, was a truly historic day in German history, and decades of discord and fraternal strife were finally completely eliminated. A new page was opened in the history of the German workers' movement. While maintaining the old fighting traditions of the German workers' movement, the foundation for the restoration of the unity of the entire German working class was laid on this day.
    For the first time in German history, in a part of Germany, the main forces of the nation—workers and peasants—became the decisive factors and created the prerequisites for the revival of the German nation on a democratic and peaceful basis. The unity of all conscious forces of the working class enabled the Socialist Unity Party of Germany to mobilize the entire people together with all anti-fascist democratic parties and mass organizations to devote themselves to building a new social system—an anti-fascist democratic system. It overcame the chaotic state of post-war Germany by relying on its own strength and gave the German people a clear national and social vision. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the vanguard of the German working class, has become the leading force and is carrying out revolutionary reforms to change the entire social life together with all working people.
    The forces of German imperialism and militarism, which launched two world wars in half a century, brought infinite suffering to the people of Europe and also to the German people, and destroyed the fruits of the labor of the working people. Now they have been permanently deprived of power in a part of Germany. The working people have seized political power, become masters of their land, and become masters of their country and their economic wealth. The far-reaching socio-economic reforms have strengthened the position of the working class and consolidated the alliance with the working peasants and other working people. From the beginning, the Party guided the anti-fascist democratic forces to pay attention to the main issues of national construction and the exercise of political power. The workers learned the ability to lead the state and the economy, and learned to exercise political power. In the arduous struggle to solve the complex tasks of democratic transformation, the Party educated and trained cadres to become conscious creators of a new life.
    In the process of democratic reform in eastern Germany, the socialist sectors in industry, agriculture, commerce, and transportation have developed and consolidated on the basis of the national economic plan. Under the leadership of the working-class party, all the forces of the people actively participated in the work of completing the great economic and political tasks. The unity of democratic parties, mass organizations, and democratic groups developed into a broad national front encompassing all of Germany. All German patriots are united in this front in the struggle to reunify Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis. Under the leadership of the Party, the construction of socialism began. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany led the German people in the national liberation struggle against the divisive policies of Western capitalist countries, and pointed out the direction and purpose of each stage of this struggle. Under its leadership, the peace-loving democratic forces of the German people answered the division of Germany and the establishment of the separate state of West Germany with the establishment of the German Democratic Republic.
    The establishment of the German Democratic Republic led to a significant strengthening of the power of the working class and its allied working peasants and other progressive strata.
    The working class and its allies are now using the state power tools they have newly established to fight for the democratic reunification of Germany and the safeguarding of peace. In the course of this struggle, the German Democratic Republic has developed into an unshakable base for the national struggle of a peaceful and all-German patriots. The program of the National Front has become a firm part of government policy. The German Democratic Republic's persistent struggle to reach an understanding with the Federal Republic of Germany on the establishment of German unity, and the various constructive proposals it has put forward to the Four Powers on the establishment of German unity, have enhanced and consolidated the national prestige of the German Democratic Republic.
    The newly established state power has also helped the working class and its allies to expand and consolidate their international ties. First, the development of effective friendly cooperation in political, economic, and cultural aspects with the countries of the peace, democracy, and socialism camp. The German Democratic Republic has also signed trade agreements with many capitalist countries. It is willing to establish good and lasting political and economic relations with all capitalist countries on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence.
    With the successful completion of the First Five-Year Plan, the economic foundation of socialist construction in the German Democratic Republic has been consolidated, and the living standards of the working people have been improved. Today we have a strong heavy industry, which is the cornerstone of our increasingly prosperous national economy and the main tool in the hands of the working class for building socialism.
    In agriculture, new socialist production methods have been adopted through agricultural production cooperatives, and great changes in agricultural production have been brought about by the adoption of new technologies.
    The working people are increasingly firmly united around the Party and the government and defend their achievements. All attempts by the enemies of socialism to sabotage our construction work are bound to fail, because the power of the worker-peasant state is deeply rooted among the people, and because the German Democratic Republic represents historical progress and the future of all the German people.
    Today, after ten years of struggle and tireless political work by our Party, we are reaping the fruits of the united action of the working class. Today, the prospects of the future German state are becoming increasingly clear to all the German people, the prospects of a unified, democratic, and peaceful state according to the example of the first worker-peasant state in German history—the German Democratic Republic.
    In the ten years since its establishment, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany has developed into the leader of the working people and has won the trust of the masses. The Third Party Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, held at the end of March this year, undoubtedly proved this fact.
    The Third Party Congress, under the banner of the unity of the working class of the entire Germany and under the banner of solving the problem of the survival of the German nation, openly and clearly discussed all current issues. This was a climax in the life of the Party and a climax in the political and economic life of the German Democratic Republic. It showed the increasing domestic and international role of the German Democratic Republic. It pointed out to the world public that the old plundering, militaristic, and imperialistic Germany has lost its right to exist in this part of Germany and will never be revived. But the Third Party Congress also pointed out to the entire German working class that a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany can only be established if all the people persist in their active opposition to the revival of German militarism and the struggle against the rearmament of West Germany. And the German working class must play a leading role in this struggle, which is vital to the lives of all the German people.
    Based on the achievements previously made, the Third Party Congress put forward two huge basic tasks:
    To complete and overfulfill the Second Five-Year Plan. The Second Five-Year Plan is the beginning of a new industrial transformation, in which atomic energy will be widely used peacefully in all aspects. At the same time, under the slogan of "modernization, mechanization, and automation," our industry will significantly expand during the Five-Year Plan process and will reach the world level in all aspects. A modern nuclear physics research center has now been established, and the construction of an atomic power plant will begin during the Second Five-Year Plan.
    The Second Five-Year Plan is not only a great economic construction plan, but also a broad social plan.
    While increasing real wages by an average of 30%, a seven-hour workday will be implemented in industry, and a forty-hour work week will be implemented in some industrial sectors without reducing wages.
    The second huge task is to continue to promote democracy in our country. According to Marxist-Leninist theory, the working people are the creators of all material and spiritual wealth. The current task of the Party is to strengthen political and ideological work to raise the consciousness of the working people and increasingly absorb them into all aspects of national life. All working people must understand that socialism is the highest form of democracy and the foundation of genuine freedom for all the people.
    Completing the tasks of the Third Party Congress will give the German Democratic Republic and all the German people a peaceful and happy future. The growing influence of the German Democratic Republic on the working people of West Germany has strengthened all the democratic forces that agree to ease tensions and conduct consultations between the two Germanys. This influence has broken the plans of the North Atlantic Group and the war instigators in West Germany.
    The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union gave us a great help in completing our tasks. It made our working people more convinced that the victory of socialism in our country and in the world is irresistible. The victory of socialism in the German Democratic Republic is certain because the German Democratic Republic is a firm component of the socialist world system, and the countries of this world system are inseparably linked and interconnected, and today it already has more than one-third of the world's population.
    The resolutions and results of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union gave our Party many creative inspirations, enabling us to solve our own tasks more effectively, taking into account the national and historical characteristics of our country. In particular, the establishment of the unity of the working class is of decisive significance in solving the problems closely related to the interests of the German people in a divided Germany.
    Through its broad Marxist-Leninist analysis of the international situation, the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union put forward a great program for the international workers' movement and the people of all countries to take common steps on the major issues of peace and democracy. This program particularly emphasized the establishment of contacts between communist parties, workers' parties, social parties, and social democratic parties, and the establishment of a broad united front. According to this instructive proposal, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany will also spread socialist ideas in Germany to that part of the working class who have not yet seen the huge, now existing possibilities of the development of socialism in the world. If the working class of the whole Germany unites, then West Germany will not rearm and rearm, and there will be no war.
    Following the current example of the German Democratic Republic, the German working class will complete the cause of unity that began on April 21, 1946, and will establish a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany together with all German patriots.
    The working class and all working people of the German Democratic Republic are happy because we have formed a solid and unbreakable friendly alliance with the powerful People's Republic of China. The signing of the Treaty on Friendship and Cooperation between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China and the joint statement issued by the governments of our two countries on December 25, 1955, were warmly supported by the working people of our country. The constantly expanding economic and cultural cooperation between our two countries has convinced them that the German Democratic Republic has strong and faithful friends, thus strengthening their confidence in the certain victory of our just cause. The working people of the German Democratic Republic are watching with great concern the leap-forward progress and great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction every day. The Chinese people have our fraternal sympathy in carrying out their great cause. We congratulate them on their new great achievements and extend fraternal fighting greetings to the 600 million people of China.

    德国统一社会党十周年
    德国统一社会党政治局委员  德意志民主共和国总理  奥托·格罗提渥
    编者按：这篇文章是格罗提渥同志为纪念德国统一社会党成立十周年特地给本报写的。我们收到的时候虽然过了纪念的日子，但是，这篇文章仍然有它的重大意义。这篇文章对于德国统一社会党在德意志民主共和国劳动人民建设社会主义、争取和平和德国重新统一的伟大而卓有成效的斗争中所起的光辉领导作用，对于德国统一社会党在目前阶段中的政策方针，都作了透彻的阐明。
    德国统一社会党十周年是，为人民的、民族的和社会的利益艰苦和牺牲重大的斗争的十年。在这十年内，我们的党同德意志民主共和国的农民及其他一切劳动人民结成了亲密的联盟，从一个成就走向一个成就，从一个胜利走向一个胜利。但是获得一切成就和胜利的先决条件是工人阶级的建立统一、我国社会民主党和共产党的合并成为德国统一社会党。1946年4月21日是德国历史上一个真正历史性的日子，数十年来的不和及兄弟间的争端终于彻底消除了。德国工人运动史上开辟了新的一页。在保持德国工人运动旧日战斗传统之下，在这一天奠下了全德国工人阶级恢复统一的基础。
    在德国历史上第一次在德国的一部分地区内，民族的主要力量——工人和农民成为决定性的因素，并创造了德国民族在民主与和平的基础上复兴的先决条件。工人阶级一切觉悟的力量的团结，使得德国统一社会党能够和一切反法西斯民主党派及群众组织共同动员全体人民，致力于建设一个新的社会制度——反法西斯民主制度。依靠自己的力量克服了战后德国的混乱状态，给了德国人民一个清楚的民族和社会的远景。德国统一社会党，德国工人阶级的先锋队，已经成为领导的力量，并和全体劳动人民共同进行改变整个社会生活的革命改革。
    在半世纪内发动了两次世界大战的德国帝国主义和军国主义势力，给欧洲人民同时也给德国人民带来了无限的痛苦，破坏了劳动人民的劳动果实。现在他们已经在德国的一部分地区内永远被剥夺了权力。劳动人民掌握了政权，成为他们土地的主人，成为他们国家的和他们经济财富的主人。深刻的社会经济改革的结果加强了工人阶级的地位，并且巩固了和劳动农民及其他劳动人民阶层的联盟。党在一开始时就指导反法西斯的民主力量重视国家建设和行使政权的主要问题。工人们学会了领导国家和经济的能力，学会了行使政权。在为解决民主改造的复杂任务而进行的艰苦斗争中，党教育了和锻炼了干部，成为新生活的自觉的创造者。
    在德国东部进行民主改革的过程中，工业、农业、商业和交通业里的社会主义部门在国民经济计划的基础上发展了并且巩固了。在工人阶级政党的领导下，全国人民的一切力量都积极参加了完成伟大的经济和政治任务的工作。民主党派、群众组织和民主团体的团结，发展成为广泛的、包括全德国的全国阵线。一切德国的爱国者，在为争取在和平民主的基础上重新统一德国的斗争中，团结在这个阵线里。在党的领导下开始了社会主义的建设。德国统一社会党领导德国人民进行反对西方资本主义国家分裂政策的民族解放斗争，对这个斗争的各个阶段指出方向和目的。在它的领导下德国人民的爱好和平的民主力量，用建立德意志民主共和国来回答德国的分裂和西德分立国家的成立。
    德意志民主共和国的成立，导致工人阶级以及和它联盟的劳动农民及其他进步阶层的权力地位的显著增强。
    工人阶级和它的同盟者现在利用他们新建立的国家的权力工具，为德国的民主的重新统一和保障和平而斗争。在这个斗争的过程中，德意志民主共和国发展成为一个和平的及一切德国爱国者的民族斗争的不可动摇的基地。全国阵线的纲领已经成为政府政策的一个坚定的组成部分。德意志民主共和国为争取和德意志联邦共和国达成关于建立德国统一的谅解所进行的坚忍的斗争，向四大国提出的关于建立德国统一的各种建设性的建议都提高了并且巩固了德意志民主共和国的国家威望。
    新建立起来的国家政权也帮助了工人阶级和它的同盟者，扩大和巩固他们的国际联系。首先发展了同和平、民主及社会主义阵营各国在政治、经济和文化方面的一种成效卓著的友好合作。德意志民主共和国也同许多资本主义国家签订了贸易协定。它愿意在和平共处原则的基础上同一切资本主义国家建立良好的和持久的政治和经济关系。
    随着第一个五年计划的胜利完成，德意志民主共和国的社会主义建设的经济基础巩固了，劳动人民的生活水平提高了。今天我们有一个强大的重工业，它是我们日益繁荣的国民经济的基石和工人阶级手里的建设社会主义的主要的工具。
    在农业方面，通过农业生产合作社采用了新的社会主义的生产方式，并且由于采用新技术而引起了农业生产的巨大变化。
    劳动人民日益坚定地团结在党和政府的周围，并且保卫他们的成果。社会主义敌人破坏我们建设工作的一切企图都必然失败，因为工农国家的政权在人民中间是根深蒂固的，而且因为德意志民主共和国代表着历史的进步和全德意志人民的未来。
    今天，在我们党进行了十年的斗争和不倦的政治工作以后，我们收获了工人阶级统一行动的果实。今天，在全德意志人民的面前日益清楚地展开了将来的德意志国家的前景，一个按照德国历史上第一个工农国家——德意志民主共和国的榜样的统一、民主及和平的国家的前景。
    德国统一社会党在它成立的十年内已发展成为劳动人民的领导者，取得了群众的信任。今年三月底召开的德国统一社会党第三次代表会议确信无疑地证明了这个事实。
    第三次党代表会议在全德国工人阶级统一的标志下，在解决德意志民族生存问题的标志下公开而明确地讨论了目前的一切问题，这是党的生活的一个高潮和德意志民主共和国政治和经济生活中的一个高潮。它显示了德意志民主共和国国内和国际作用的增长。它向世界公众指出，旧日的掠夺成性的军国主义和帝国主义的德国，在德国的这一部分地区已经丧失了它的生存权利，并且永远不会复活了。但是第三次党代表会议也向全德国工人阶级指出，统一的爱好和平的和民主的德国，只有在全体人民坚持不懈地积极地反对德国军国主义的复活，反对西德重新武装的斗争中才能建立。而德国工人阶级必须在这个对全体德国人民生命攸关的斗争中起领导作用。
    第三次党代表会议根据以前所取得的成就提出了两项巨大的基本的任务：
    完成和超额完成第二个五年计划。第二个五年计划是一个新的工业变革的开始，在这个变革中，将在各方面广泛和平使用原子能。同时在“现代化、机械化、自动化”的口号下，我们的工业将要在五年计划过程中显著扩大，并且要在各方面都达到世界水平。现在已经建立了一个现代化的核子物理研究中心，并且在第二个五年计划的过程中要开始建设一个原子能发电站。
    第二个五年计划不只是一个伟大的经济建设计划，而且还是一个广泛的社会计划。
    在平均提高实际工资30％的同时，要在工业中实行每日七小时工作制和在某些工业部门里不减少工资地实行每周工作四
  十小时的制度。
    第二个巨大的任务是在我们国家内继续发扬民主。根据马克思列宁主义的学说，劳动人民群众是一切物质和精神财富的创造者，党的目前的任务，是加强政治思想工作来提高劳动人民的觉悟，日益广泛地吸收他们参加全部国家生活。必须让全体劳动人民明白，社会主义是民主的最高形式和全体人民真正自由的基础。
    完成第三次党代表会议的任务，将会给德意志民主共和国和全德意志人民一个和平幸福的远景。德意志民主共和国对于西德劳动人民的增长着的影响，加强了一切赞同两个德国之间缓和紧张局势和进行协商的民主力量。这种影响打破了北大西洋集团和西德战争挑拨者的计划。
    在完成我们的任务方面，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会给了我们一个很大的帮助。它使我们劳动人民更加坚信社会主义在我国和在世界上的胜利都是不可阻挡的。社会主义在德意志民主共和国的胜利所以是肯定的，因为德意志民主共和国是社会主义世界体系的一个坚定的组成部分，这个世界体系的各国是不可分离的互相关联着的，今天它已经拥有全世界人口的三分之一以上。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的决议和结果给了我们党许多创造性的启示，使我们在考虑到我国的民族和历史特点的情况下更有效地解决我们自己的任务。特别是关于建立工人阶级的统一，在分裂的德国内对于解决和德国人民切身利益有关的问题有决定性的意义。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会通过它对国际形势所做的广泛的马克思列宁主义分析，提出了国际工人运动和各国人民在和平和民主的重大问题上采取共同步骤的伟大的纲领。这个纲领特别着重在建立共产党、工人党和社会党及社会民主党的接触和建立一条广泛的统一战线。根据这个指示性的建议，德国统一社会党也将在德国国内把社会主义的思想，传布给工人阶级中的那一部分人，他们现在还没有看到世界上社会主义发展的巨大的、现在已经存在的可能性。如果全德国的工人阶级统一起来，那么西德就不会重整军备和重新武装，不会有战争。
    按照目前德意志民主共和国的榜样，德国工人阶级将会完成1946年4月21日就已开始的统一事业，并和一切德国爱国人士一道建立一个统一、和平和民主的德国。
    德意志民主共和国的工人阶级和一切劳动人民是幸福的，因为我们和强大的中华人民共和国结成巩固的和牢不可破的友好联盟。德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国友好合作条约的签订以及我们两国政府在1955年12月25日发表的联合声明，受到我国劳动人民的热烈拥护。我们两国之间不断扩大的经济和文化合作使他们确信，德意志民主共和国有着强大的忠实的朋友，因而加强了他们对我们正义事业一定胜利的信心。德意志民主共和国的劳动人民极其关怀地注视着中国人民在社会主义建设上每天所取得的飞跃进步和伟大成就。中国人民在进行他们的伟大事业中得到我们兄弟般的同情。我们祝贺他们获得新的伟大的成就，并且向中国六亿人民致以兄弟般的战斗的敬礼。
