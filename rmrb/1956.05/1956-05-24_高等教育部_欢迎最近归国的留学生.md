Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: Ding Hua, Assistant Minister of the Ministry of Higher Education, held a forum today to welcome seven Chinese students who have returned from the United States, France, and Sweden in the past month or so to participate in the construction of the motherland.

    Si Chongyao, a metallurgy master's student who returned from the United States, said at the forum that the scientific research equipment in metallurgy in the motherland is no less than that of the United States, Britain, and other countries. He believes that the general equipment of the Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology is better than some schools in the United States. He said that now college students can study according to their major and have such complete equipment, they will surely achieve good learning results. Liu Ziqiang, a student who graduated from the French Department of the University of Paris in France, said that after returning to China, he saw that things that were previously considered incredible are now actually being done. After returning to China, there will never be a case of "a hero having no place to use his skills." Liao Shantao, who obtained a Ph.D. in mathematics from the Graduate School of the University of Chicago in the United States, said that the motherland lacks scientific research talents, so we must conduct research work on the one hand, and pay attention to cultivating research talents on the other.

    These returned students expressed their full confidence in catching up with the world's advanced level in scientific research.

    欢迎最近归国的留学生
    据新华社23日讯　高等教育部部长助理丁华今天举行座谈会，欢迎最近一个多月来从美国、法国、瑞典回国参加祖国建设的七名中国留学生。
    从美国归国的留学生、冶金学硕士斯重遥在座谈会上说，祖国在冶金方面的科学研究设备并不低于美、英等国。他认为北京钢铁工业学院的一般设备比美国有些学校要好。他说，现在高等学校学生能够按专业进行学习，又能有这样完善的设备，一定可以取得很好的学习效果。毕业于法国巴黎大学法文系的留学生刘自强说，回国后看到过去认为难以置信的事情现在都确实在做了。回国以后，决不会“英雄无用武之地”。取得美国芝加哥大学研究院数学博士学位的廖山涛说，祖国的科学研究人材不足，我们一方面要进行研究工作，同时还要注意培养研究人材。
    这些归国留学生们表示，完全有信心在科学研究方面赶上世界先进的水平。
