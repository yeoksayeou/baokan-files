　　China's First Neurosurgical Institution
　　By Our Reporter Jian Yuan
    A young science in the world—neurosurgery, has begun to establish and grow in China. The Neurosurgery Department of Beijing Tongren Hospital is China's first new type of independent neurosurgical institution. Now, it has more than fifty beds, and can perform surgeries that are generally done in international neurosurgery. However, our work on related physiological and pathological academic aspects has only just begun. This Neurosurgery Department is led by Professor Zhao Yicheng, a Chinese neurosurgery expert, and has eleven other young doctors, all of whom can independently perform relatively complex surgeries.
    On the afternoon of April 13th, a brain surgery was about to take place in the inpatient department of the Neurosurgery Department of Beijing Tongren Hospital. With the doctor's permission, the reporter put on a white coat and entered the electrified operating room specially equipped for neurosurgery along with the doctors and nurses.
    At 2:30 PM, the operation began. The patient was a housewife, 29 years old, and the mother of four children. Since 1954, her menstruation had been irregular, and her vision had gradually decreased. Her left eye was almost blind, and her right eye could barely see finger movements at one meter. After consultation with doctors from various departments, it was determined that she had a tumor in the central sella turcica region of the brain, called a pituitary adenoma. Now this tumor was to be removed. The patient lay supine on the operating table, covered with layers of white sterile sheets, leaving only a tea-cup-sized area of her right forehead exposed, which had been anesthetized. The doctor first incised the skin flap on this area and flipped it forward onto the forehead, exposing the periosteum. Then, the doctor cut the anterior, posterior, and left sides of the periosteum. The doctor began to use a bone drill to drill holes in the four corners of this piece of skull, and then used a steel wire saw to saw through the anterior, posterior, and left sides of the skull, lifting the skull to the right, exposing the dura mater. The doctor picked up a lighted hook equipped with a grain-of-rice-sized light bulb and peeled the dura mater away from the frontal bone, then used a sharp small hook knife to cut an opening in the dura mater. Exploration began. The doctor used the lighted hook and electro-aspirator to probe through this opening, again and again, patiently and intently. During the surgery, the patient made suggestions at any time, and the nurse or doctor answered at any time. At 4:25 PM, the tumor was found. It was very large and had destroyed the normal anatomical relationships. The tumor was indeed located in the sella turcica region of the brain, which is related to endocrine growth, and the largest artery in the cranial cavity passes through here, and the two optic nerves also extend from here to the eyes. The doctor pointed to the patient's right optic nerve for the reporter to see. Although the location of the patient's tumor was very deep, the doctor could use specially made scissors to gradually remove it bit by bit. This tumor was about the size of an ordinary chestnut. At 5:30 PM, the tumor was completely removed. The doctor began to suture the periosteum, then sutured the subcutaneous tissue, and finally sutured the scalp. At 6:00 PM sharp, the entire operation was successfully completed. During the entire operation, every bleeding point was stopped with electrocautery.
    For these past few days, this patient has been lying quietly in the ward, recuperating.
    Along with this patient, there are more than forty patients staying in the neurosurgery ward. Many of them have also undergone similar brain surgeries by the doctors. The doctor led the reporter to visit these patients in the ward.
    Wu Shunchang, a retired soldier and coal miner from Yangquan, is thirty-seven years old. In 1947, he suffered a shrapnel wound to the top right side of his head during the Liberation War and had surgery in a rear hospital, and the wound healed. For the past three years, he had suffered from focal epilepsy in his left upper limb, and for the past year, he had suffered from headaches and vomiting. Later, his condition worsened, and he was unable to work in January of this year. After being diagnosed by the doctors here, he was found to have a late-stage brain abscess on the top right side of his forehead. On March 27th, the doctor performed brain surgery to remove the abscess, and he recovered.
    Zhang Demin, a thirteen-year-old girl, had dizziness and tinnitus, and had been vomiting continuously, having headaches, and experiencing vision loss for the past three months. After being admitted to the hospital, the doctor performed a posterior fossa exploration on her and found a cysticercus cellulosae in the fourth ventricle. The cysticercus cellulosae was immediately removed. Now the little girl's face is rosy, and she told the reporter that her head no longer hurts, she is completely healed, and she has gained three kilograms in weight during her stay in the ward these past few days.
    Since its establishment, the Neurosurgery Department of Beijing Tongren Hospital has treated a total of five hundred and seventy patients, including one hundred and ninety-six brain surgeries. The tumors removed in one hundred and seventeen brain surgeries are now displayed as specimens in the pathology examination room. The doctor pointed to several large and complete meningiomas and explained them to the reporter. The human brain generally weighs twelve to fifteen taels (approx. 450-560 grams). There is a tumor here that weighs 1.63 taels (approx. 61 grams) and was removed from the brain of a porter named Zhang Deming in July 1955. Zhang Deming was originally bedridden, but gradually recovered after the surgery. The heaviest tumor weighed 2.16 taels (approx. 81 grams) and was removed from the brain of a housewife named Ma Guiru in July 1955. After the surgery, Ma Guiru's headaches, vomiting, and other symptoms were cured. Unfortunately, she sought treatment too late, and her two blind eyes could not be restored. Judging from all the patients accepted here in the past year, the treatment effect is generally very good. For example, for meningiomas, the general mortality rate internationally is 10% to 15%, but the surgeries performed here on fifteen patients were all successful.
    The Neurosurgery Department of Beijing Tongren Hospital will become the base point for the establishment and development of neurosurgery in China. This newborn first neurosurgical institution was established in March 1955 with the specific help of Soviet Meritorious Scientist Professor Yarutyunov. Yarutyunov is the director of the Kiev Neurosurgery Research Institute. After arriving in China in October 1954, he actively helped us prepare for the establishment of this Neurosurgery Department and formulated a plan for training cadres for us. First, he opened an advanced training class for us. He personally presided over teaching, medical treatment, and guided research work. The eleven young doctors who can now work independently are his students. At the same time, he also helped us plan the direction and specific steps for the development of neurosurgery in China. He told Chinese neurosurgery workers that establishing and developing neurosurgery has great significance. According to scientific estimates, there are more than 60,000 patients with neuro-brain tumors in China every year. China should establish its own neurosurgery research institute so that this particularly young science in China can also strive to catch up with international levels.
    After sowing beautiful scientific seeds in China, Professor Yarutyunov returned to Kiev in June 1955. But he still always misses the growth of the seeds he sowed. He constantly sends letters to Chinese neurosurgery workers. Chinese neurosurgery workers also always excitedly write back to their teacher Yarutyunov, telling him: The seeds he sowed have begun to germinate. Telling him: Chinese neurosurgery workers are forming a collective under the leadership of Professor Zhao Yicheng, serving patients well, and beginning special research work; striving to establish the first neurosurgery research institute.

　　我国第一个神经外科机构
　　本报记者　鉴远
    世界上一门年青的科学——神经外科医学已经开始在我国建立和成长。北京市同仁医院神经外科就是我国第一个新型的独立的神经外科机构。现在，它有五十多张病床，国际上神经外科一般能做的手术，这里也能做。但是有关的生理、病理学术上的工作，我们还刚在开始。这个神经外科是由我国神经外科专家赵以成教授领导的，另有十一个年青大夫，他们都可以独立做比较复杂的手术。
    四月十三日下午，在北京市同仁医院神经外科住院部，一个开脑袋的手术就要进行。记者得大夫允许，穿起白大褂，和大夫、护士们一起走进神经外科特备的电气化的手术室。
    二时半，手术开始，患者是一个家庭主妇，二十九岁，是四个孩子的母亲。她从1954年起月经不正常，视力渐渐减退，左眼近盲，右眼在一公尺处勉强可见手指抖动。经有关各科大夫会诊，确定为脑中央蝶鞍部位长了瘤子，名叫垂体瘤。现在就要摘除这个瘤子。患者仰卧在手术床上，一层层白色的无菌单盖满了她的全身，只右额部有普通茶杯口大的一块露在外面，这一块已经过麻醉。大夫先切开这一块的皮瓣，把它翻向前额，露出骨膜。再切开骨膜的前、后、左三面，大夫开始用骨钻在这一块头骨的四角钻眼，又用钢线锯锯开头骨的前、后、左三面，把头骨向右掀起，露出脑膜。大夫拿起一个装有一颗大米大的电灯的带灯钩，把脑膜从额骨剥开，再用锐利的小钩刀把脑膜切开一个口子。探查开始，大夫用带灯钩和电吸血器从这个口子探进去，一次再一次，他们耐心而紧张地进行着。手术进行中，患者随时提出意见，护士或大夫随时回答。四时二十五分，找到了瘤子。它很大，已经破坏了正常的解剖关系。瘤子所在处的确是脑的蝶鞍部位，这里关系内分泌的生长，到颅内最大的动脉都通过这里，两条视神经也从这里伸到眼部。大夫指着患者右边的视神经让记者看。患者这个瘤子的部位虽然很深，但大夫可以用特制的剪子把它一点点往外取。这个瘤子有普通的一个栗子那样大。五时三十分，瘤子取完。开始缝骨膜，再把皮下组织缝起来，最后把头皮缝起来。六时正，全部手术顺利结束。在整个手术过程中，每个出血点都给用电灼止住。
    这些天以来，这位患者一直躺在病房里安静地休养。
    和这位患者一起，住在神经外科病房里的患者共有四十多人。他们中的许多人也已经由大夫做过了类似的开脑袋的手术。大夫领记者到病房看望了这些患者。
    一位复员军人吴顺昌，阳泉煤矿工人，三十七岁。1947年他在解放战争中右侧顶部受弹片伤，曾经在后方医院动过手术，伤口痊愈。近三年来他患了左上肢局限性癫痫，近一年来则头痛、呕吐，以后病况加重，到今年一月不能劳动。经这里大夫诊断，他患的是右额顶部晚期脑脓肿。三月二十七日大夫为他开脑袋取出脓肿以后，痊愈了。
    一个十三岁的小姑娘张德敏，头晕耳鸣，近三个月来连续呕吐，头痛，视力减退。入院以后，大夫为她施行后颅凹探查术，在第四脑室发见猪螩虫囊，立即取出这个猪螩虫囊。现在小姑娘脸红红的，她告诉记者说，她头不痛了，完全好了，住在病房这些天体重已经增加三公斤。
    北京市同仁医院神经外科建立以来，共为五百七十个患者进行了治疗，其中开脑袋一百九十六次。一百十七次开脑袋取出的瘤子，现在被制作标本陈列在病理检查室里。大夫指着几个大的完整的脑膜瘤为记者解说。人脑一般重十二到十五公两。这里有一个瘤子重一点六三公两，是1955年7月间从搬运工人张德明的脑袋里取出的。张德明本来已经卧床不起，动手术以后逐渐痊愈了。最重的一个瘤子二点一六公两，是1955年7月间从家庭妇女马桂如脑袋里取出的。动手术以后，马桂如的头痛、呕吐等症痊愈了。遗憾的是她医治太晚，两只失明的眼睛已经无法恢复。从这里一年来接受的全部患者来看，治疗效果一般很好。如脑膜瘤，国际上一般的死亡率是10％到15％，这里为十五个患者做的手术，全部成功。
    北京市同仁医院神经外科将成为我国神经外科医学建立和发展的基点。这新生的第一个神经外科机构，是苏联功勋科学家亚鲁秋诺夫教授具体帮助我们在1955年3月间建立的。亚鲁秋诺夫是基辅神经外科研究所所长。1954年10月间他到我国以后，就积极帮助我们筹建这个神经外科，并为我们制定了培养干部的计划。首先他为我们开办了一个进修班，他亲自主持教学、医疗，并指导研究工作。现在能独立进行工作的十一个年青大夫就是他的学生。同时他还帮助我们规划中国神经外科发展的方向和具体步骤。他告诉我国神经外科工作者们，建立、发展神经外科，有着重大意义，根据科学的估计，中国仅神经脑瘤患者每年就有六万人以上。中国应该建立自己的神经外科研究所，使中国这一门特别年青的科学也努力赶上国际水平。
    亚鲁秋诺夫教授在我国撒下美好的科学种子以后，1955年6月间回到基辅去了。但他仍然时刻怀念着他撒下的种子的成长。他不断给中国神经外科工作者们来信。中国神经外科工作者们也总是兴奋地回信给自己的老师亚鲁秋诺夫，告诉他：他撒下的种子已经开始发芽了。告诉他：中国神经外科工作者正在赵以成教授领导下形成一个集体，很好地为患者服务，并开始了专题研究工作；为建立第一个神经外科研究所而努力。
