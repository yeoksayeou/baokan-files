Opinions on the Production of Small Agricultural Irrigation Power Machinery
National People's Congress Representative Lu Jingyun

I have learned about the manufacturing of internal combustion engines in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, Hangzhou and Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, and Shanghai. I have encountered some issues and would like to raise them for the reference of the leading comrades and working comrades in this field.

The production tasks of these factories this year have greatly exceeded those of last year. Last year, between June and July, many factories had insufficient production tasks and were forced to suspend work and reduce production. Now, the situation has changed to one where production tasks are tight everywhere, and there is a shortage of everything. A large portion of these suddenly increased tasks involves small power machinery for rural irrigation, and the vast majority of this burden falls on the shoulders of local factories, exceeding the production capacity that various regions can provide by a factor of one or more. To complete this task, the industrial leadership departments in various regions are urgently implementing various measures, and the workers in the factories are tapping their potential with unprecedented enthusiasm.

However, if we want to avoid detours and achieve the central government's directive of being faster, more numerous, better, and more economical, we still need to conduct a comprehensive consideration and in-depth research on the guiding principles, methods, and specific measures.

Some factories used to manufacture single-cylinder, horizontal, low-speed diesel engines with outdated designs and excessive material consumption. If they continue to expand production using the original designs, while it may save a lot of work in technical preparation, it will increase the burden on users and will not be efficient. In the past, some factories, in order to meet market demands, produced a variety of different types and sizes of machines. Now, as they transition to larger-scale production, they attempt to maintain these various types without selection or elimination. This will result in small production batches, limiting the improvement of labor productivity. Some factories do not consider equipment conditions and the current level of technical skill in rural areas, and they want to manufacture some relatively large and complex machines. This not only increases manufacturing difficulties, but also may result in unsalable products after production. Some individual factories are unwilling to produce gas engines that use solid fuel. The fuel problem must be considered from a long-term and comprehensive perspective. We should avoid using petroleum products as much as possible, especially light diesel oil. This is because the tight supply of petroleum in our country cannot be changed in the short term. Therefore, the adoption of solid fuel for rural machinery power is a principle that must be adhered to in the future.

The correct guiding principle for selecting manufacturing models should be: adhering to the premise of being economical and practical, taking into account the convenience of factory production, and selecting models that have been proven. Within a region (not necessarily limited to provincial boundaries, but mainly based on farmland topography or crop types), simplify the manufacturing models to one or two types, so that they can meet the needs of the region and nearby areas, while also saving technical resources in manufacturing and adapting to the existing equipment capacity. Both large and small factories can be organized to cooperate in manufacturing.

The technical strength of machinery manufacturing is insufficient nationwide, and the technical strength of local factories engaged in the manufacturing of small power machinery is even weaker. In the past, when production was small, it was still manageable. Now that the scale of production has increased several times, the quality and quantity of technical work need to be greatly improved and increased accordingly. To overcome the difficulty of insufficient technical strength, on the one hand, we should simplify manufacturing models and increase production batches to save technical resources. On the other hand, local industries should also strive to obtain technical support from nearby state-owned large factories of the same type as much as possible, consciously select and imitate the models manufactured by state-owned factories, and strive to obtain the convenience of using technical data and process equipment. In order to support the agricultural cooperative movement, the central competent industrial departments should also take the initiative to help local factories improve their technical and management levels, introduce products suitable for rural use and that are technically mature to local factories for imitation, and undertake the supply of some more difficult parts and precision process equipment.

The equipment of general local factories is relatively simple and old, and the equipment of joint state-private enterprises is even more rudimentary. Now, in order to meet the requirements of the new tasks, many factories are striving to increase new equipment. However, everyone is not paying enough attention to how to maximize the potential of the original equipment. In fact, the potential is great. For example, machine tools that do not meet the precision requirements, or are not convenient or safe enough to operate, can be solved by adding process equipment such as fixtures, semi-automatic devices, and safety devices. Equipment with weak production capacity, or operations with slow production speed, can be solved by strengthening the transmission mechanism and increasing the number of workpieces produced simultaneously. In mechanical processing, multi-tool, multi-edge, and modular simultaneous processing can be implemented. In casting and forging production, multi-piece co-molding and the use of metal energy and other methods can be implemented.

On the issue of materials for internal combustion engine manufacturing, the difficulty commonly encountered now is the insufficient supply of large forging blanks, especially crankshafts. There is a lack of both large-sized rolled steel and large-sized forging equipment. Currently, most are forged from cast steel ingots on steam hammers, with little elongation and many raw material defects. A few use rolled steel, but because the power of the forging hammer is insufficient, die forging cannot be performed. Crankshafts made in this way not only fail to meet the design requirements in terms of lifespan, but also waste processing time, the product quality is not guaranteed, and the processing cost is high. Some regions have already established specialized factories to supply forgings, which is certainly a correct approach. However, a more convenient solution would be to actively research and replace forgings with ductile iron or high-grade alloy cast iron. This is because solving the metallurgical problems in casting is simpler than solving the smelting and rolling problems of special steel, and creating casting conditions is faster and more economical than creating die-forging conditions. The shape control of cast blanks is also more accurate than that of forged blanks. In this way, there is a great possibility of increasing output, reducing raw material blanks, and lowering processing costs.

In the past year, the cost of small internal combustion engines (diesel engines) has already dropped from over 200 yuan per horsepower to below 150 yuan, and individual factories have been able to achieve around 110 yuan per horsepower. This is still the achievement when the manufacturing batch is not large. The key to reducing costs lies in accurately selecting the model, increasing the production batch, and rationally applying materials. Currently, when selecting manufacturing models, planning production batches, and considering material requirements, factories are not paying enough attention to cost. If the country were to define a unified control target for the cost of machines produced in various regions, it would play a significant role in promoting production improvements, eliminating unsuitable models, promoting fuel conservation, and reducing farmers' investment.

Some regions are already considering the longer-term prospects when conducting planning, and this approach is very correct. When making such considerations, we should overcome right-leaning conservative thinking and look at the problem more boldly and comprehensively. Some people believe that the number of small power machines needed in rural areas can be fully met within two or three years, and therefore they are currently considering the issue of changing production targets after two or three years. This idea is incorrect. According to preliminary estimates, in the next ten years, the country will still need to produce more than 500,000 horsepower of small agricultural irrigation machinery annually. The current strength of the country engaged in this manufacturing is still far from enough. Then, when making long-term plans at present, we should consider its development steps. The issue of changing careers in the short term does not need to be considered.

The mechanical equipment needed in rural areas is very extensive, and small power machinery is only one of them. If we can produce one more horsepower of power equipment in a year, or bring forward the production of this one horsepower of equipment from the end of the year to the beginning of the year, so that it can be used for one more season, it can increase grain production by 5,000 jin for the country. This is worth our efforts to strive for.

### 对生产小型农业灌溉动力机械的意见

    对生产小型农业灌溉动力机械的意见
    全国人民代表大会代表　陆景云
    我曾在江西省的南昌、浙江省的杭州、宁波，江苏省的无锡和上海等地，了解内燃机制造工业的情况，接触到一些问题，想提出来供这方面的领导同志和工作同志们参考。
    我所了解的这些工厂，今年的生产任务都大大超过了去年。去年六、七月间，很多工厂的生产任务不足，停工减产；现在变为生产任务处处紧张，样样产品都不够了。这些突然增加的任务，很大部分是农村灌溉用的小型动力机械，其中的绝大部分则是落在地方工厂的肩上，超过了各地区所能提供的生产能力的一倍或更多。为了完成这个任务，各地区的工业领导部门都在紧张地实行各种措施，各厂的职工以从来没有的劲头发掘潜力。
    不过，我们若要不走弯路，做到中央所指示的又快、又多、又好、又省，我们还得要在方针方法上和具体措施上作全面考虑，深入研究。
    有些工厂过去制造单缸、卧式、低速、型式陈旧、用料又多的柴油机。现在仍旧沿用原来的型式扩大生产，固然在技术准备上可以省去很多工作，但是将会给用户增加负担，而且效率不高。过去有些工厂为了应付市场要求，曾做过多种不同型式、不同大小的机器，现在转入较大量的生产，企图仍旧保持这些型式，不加选择淘汰。这样就会使生产的批量太小，限制了劳动生产率的提高。有些工厂不考虑设备条件和目前农村的使用技术水平，想制造一些比较大型的复杂的机器，这不只增加制造的困难，而且生产出来以后，还可能卖不出去。个别工厂不愿生产用固体燃料的煤气机。对于燃料问题，必须从长远和全面的打算来考虑，应当尽可能避免使用石油的产品，尤其不能用轻质柴油。因为我国石油供应的紧张局面不是短时期所能改变的。所以，今后农村机械动力采用固体燃料，是必须坚持的方针。
    选择制造型式的正确方针应该是：按照经济实用的前提，照顾到工厂生产的方便，选用已经考验过的型式。在一个地区（不一定以省区为界，而是以农田地形或农作物类别为主），简化制造型式为一、二种，使它既能适合本地区和附近地区的需要，又能在制造上节省技术力量，适应原有的设备能力，不论大小工厂都可以组织起来协作制造。
    机械制造的技术力量，在全国范围内是不足的，从事小型动力机械制造的地方工厂的技术力量更加薄弱。以往小量生产的时候还可以应付，现在生产规模成倍地增大了，技术工作的质和量都需要相应地大大提高和增加。要克服技术力量不足的困难，一方面应该简化制造型式、增大生产批量，以节约技术力量；另一方面，地方工业还应该尽量争取附近同类型的国营大工厂在技术上的支援，有意识地选用和仿造国营工厂所制造的机型，争取能够得到利用技术资料和工艺装备等等的方便。中央主管工业部门为了支援农业合作化运动，也应该主动地帮助地方工厂提高技术和管理水平，把适合农村使用而制造技术上已经成熟的产品，介绍给地方工厂仿制，并且负担起一部分比较难做的零件和精密工艺装备的供应。
    一般地方工厂的设备，本来是比较简单陈旧的，公私合营的工厂，设备就更为简陋。现在为了适应新任务的要求，许多工厂都在争取增加新设备。但是，对于如何发挥原有设备的潜力，大家都注意得不够。其实，潜力是很大的。比如，精密程度达不到的，或操作不够方便、不够安全的机床，可以用增加工卡具、半自动装置和安全装置等工艺装备来解决；生产能力薄弱的设备，或生产速度慢的操作，可以用增强传动机构和增加同时多产的工件数来解决。在机械加工方面，可以实行多刀、多刃和模件同时加工；在铸锻生产方面，可以实行多件同模和使用金属能等方法。
    在内燃机制造的材料问题上，现在普遍遇到的困难，是大件锻胚供应不足；尤其是曲轴，既缺乏大型的压延钢材，又缺乏大型的锻制设备。目前多数是用铸成的钢锭在汽锤上锻长，延伸率不大，原料疵病也多；少数用压延钢材，但是因锻锤力量不足，不能进行模锻。这样做成的曲轴，寿命既不能达到设计要求，又浪费加工时间，产品质量没有保证，加工成本又高。现在有些地区已经建立专业工厂供给锻件，这固然是一个正确的办法；但是更便捷的解决方法，应该是积极研究改用球墨铸铁或高级合金铸铁来代替锻件。因为解决铸造中的冶金问题比解决特殊钢材的冶炼和轧制问题简单，创备铸造条件也比创备模锻条件快捷省费，铸胚的形状控制也比锻胚准确。这样，增加产量、降低毛胚和加工成本，就都有了极大的可能。
    一年来，小型内燃机（柴油机）的成本已经由每马力200元以上降至150元以下，个别的工厂已经能做到每马力110元左右。这还是在制造批量不大的时候的成就。降低成本的关键在于确当地选择机型，增大生产批量，和合理地应用材料。目前各厂在选择制造型式、计划生产批量、考虑材料要求的时候，对于成本方面还注意不够；假如对各地所生产机器的成本规定全国统一的控制指标，则对于推动生产的改进、淘汰不适合的机型、促进燃料的节约、减少农民的投资，将会起极大的作用。
    有些地区在进行规划的时候已经在考虑到较长远的前景，这样做法是很对的。在作这样考虑的时候，应该克服右倾保守思想，更大胆、更全面地来看问题。有的人认为农村所需小型动力机的数量，在二、三年内就可以完全满足，因而目前就在考虑二、三年后改换生产目标的问题；这种想法是不正确的。据初步估计，在今后十年内，全国每年生产五十万马力以上的小型农业灌溉机械，还是需要的。而全国现在从事这项制造的力量，还很不够；那末目前在做长期规划的时候，应该考虑它的发展步骤；在短期内转业的问题，就不必在考虑之中了。
    农村所需要的机械装备是很多的，小型动力机械，不过是其中的一项。我们如能在一年中多生产一马力的动力设备，或把这一马力设备的生产从年底提前到年初，使它能多利用一个季节，就可以为国家增产五千斤粮食；这是值得我们努力争取的。
