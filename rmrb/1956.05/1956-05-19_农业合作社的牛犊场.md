Agricultural Cooperative's Calf Farm

    The Dengta No. 1 Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dali County, Shaanxi Province, recently delivered its first batch of twenty raised calves. These cattle have been allocated to production teams to participate in the summer harvest.

    Currently, the farm is still raising fifty calves; it is expected that the second and third batches of raised cattle will be delivered successively after the wheat harvest and during the autumn harvest. When all seventy cattle are put into agricultural production, the problem of draught animals needed by this agricultural cooperative can be basically solved, thereby greatly reducing livestock investment.

    Since this agricultural cooperative transitioned to an advanced cooperative last winter, on the one hand, many calves were bred within the cooperative, making it very inconvenient to raise them together with large livestock; on the other hand, many cooperative members kept a batch of calves for themselves when transferring to the cooperative, and they also felt that there were many troubles in raising them. After the management committee of the cooperative discovered this problem, it immediately held a meeting to discuss it. In addition to criticizing the cooperative members' ideas of only caring about immediate interests and not having long-term plans, and strengthening education on cherishing young livestock, it also selected seven cooperative members with experience in raising young livestock and a group of young cooperative members from the cooperative to specially establish a calf farm. All seventy calves in the cooperative were well protected and raised. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    农业合作社的牛犊场
    陕西省大荔县灯塔第一农业生产合作社的牛犊场，最近交出了第一批饲养长大的二十头牛。这些牛已经分配给生产队，参加夏收。
    现在场内还饲养着五十头牛犊；预计在麦收后和秋收期间，将陆续交出第二批和第三批饲养长大的牛。当七十头牛全部投入农业生产后，这个农业合作社需要的耕畜问题可以基本得到解决，从而大大减少牲畜投资。
    这个农业合作社自去冬转为高级社后，一方面社内繁殖牛犊很多，和大牲畜放在一起饲养很不方便；另一方面许多社员在转社的时候给自己留下一批牛犊，他们在饲养中也感到有很多麻烦。社的管理委员会发现这个问题后，立即开会研究讨论，除对社员只顾眼前利益，没有长远打算的思想进行批判，并且加强爱护幼畜的教育外，还从社内抽出七个饲养幼畜有经验的社员和一部分青年社员，专门成立了一个牛犊场，全社七十头牛犊都被很好地保护和饲养。（据新华社讯）
