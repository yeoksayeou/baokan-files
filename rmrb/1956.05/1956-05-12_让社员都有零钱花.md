    Let All Commune Members Have Pocket Money
    Zhang Xinghan, Wei Zhongxiu

    The Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xucun, Tunliu County, Shanxi Province, currently has 247 member households. When the cooperative was first established, the staff were only busy leading production and did not pay enough attention to the problem of commune members lacking pocket money and money for emergencies, which made commune members feel hardship. Some people became emotional because of this and did not produce well.

    The Party branch discovered this problem and, together with the cooperative's management committee, studied it and concluded that guaranteeing commune members the pocket money they needed for daily life was very important for doing a good job in production. Therefore, the cooperative adopted many measures to perfectly solve the problems of commune members needing money for the New Year, festivals, buying salt, buying fuel, buying clothes, and for emergencies such as weddings and funerals, which improved the commune members' enthusiasm for labor.

    The solution is to develop the cooperative's sideline production in a planned way without delaying agricultural work. Based on the conditions of the cooperative, they allocated a portion of the labor force to specialize in sideline production such as oil mills, flour mills, pig raising, and brick and tile kilns. From the income of sideline production, without affecting the cooperative's capital turnover, a portion of cash is extracted to solve the following three difficulties of commune members in accordance with regulations: First, in the event of major events such as weddings and funerals, each commune member is given an advance of 20 yuan per event; second, commune members are given some advances for major festivals such as the Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and Spring Festival; third, commune members are given advances at their discretion for buying salt, firewood, and clothes, depending on the severity of the difficulties. In 1955, 1,255 yuan was advanced to solve these problems for commune members, averaging 5.9 yuan per household.

    Relying solely on the cooperative's sideline profits to solve the problem of commune members' pocket money is still limited after all. Therefore, the cooperative's management committee attached particular importance to mobilizing commune members to do a good job in household sideline production. Based on the conditions of this cooperative, it is possible to develop pig and chicken raising sidelines. At the beginning, commune members lacked the habit of raising pigs, fearing it would delay work and be troublesome, and were unwilling to raise pigs. The cooperative staff specially summarized the successful example of commune member Wang Qing and his mother raising pigs, and promoted it to the commune members. Wang Qing and his wife raised pigs and produced 48 piglets throughout the year, earning 280 yuan. In addition to household expenses and providing for their two sons to go to school, there was still a surplus. After that, the number of pig-raising households increased year by year. Now, except for six households such as the bachelor Gao Sizhi, every commune member household raises pigs and chickens. In 1955, commune members' income from raising pigs and chickens reached 7,385 yuan, averaging 35 yuan per household.

    Another method is to encourage commune members to accumulate fertilizer. The cooperative uses a portion of the production base expenses of the year to buy the sheep manure accumulated by commune members. In this way, commune members actively pick up sheep manure and sell it to the cooperative, which not only increases the cooperative's fertilizer but also gives the commune members pocket money. Currently, more than 7,000 jin of sheep manure has been purchased for 140 yuan in cash.

    The cooperative management committee also pays attention to organizing commune members to spend money and helps them develop the habit of thrift and frugality. It often conducts education on thrift and patriotic savings for commune members. After the summer and autumn harvest settlements, commune members are mobilized to deposit the money in agricultural cooperatives or credit cooperatives, and they can withdraw it at any time when they need pocket money or money for emergencies. Now, commune members not only no longer lack pocket money, but also have surplus money to deposit in agricultural cooperatives or credit cooperatives.

    让社员都有零钱花
    张兴汗　魏忠秀
    山西屯留县许村先锋农业生产合作社，现有社员二百四十七户。社初建成的时候，社的工作人员只忙于领导生产，对于社员缺乏零花钱和急用钱的问题，注意不够，使社员感到困难。有些人因此闹情绪，不好好生产。
    党支部发现这个问题，便协同社的管理委员会共同作了研究，认为保证社员有生活所需的零花钱，对搞好生产很重要。于是，合作社采取了许多办法，完满地解决了社员过年、过节和平时买盐、买烧、添置穿戴以及因婚丧等事急用钱的问题，提高了社员们的劳动情绪。
    解决的方法是：在不误农时的前提下，有计划地发展社的副业生产。他们依据本社条件，抽出一部分劳力，专门进行油房、粉房、养猪、砖瓦窑等副业生产。副业生产所得，在不影响社的资金流转的情况下，抽出一部分现款，按规定解决社员以下三方面的困难问题。一、凡遇婚、丧大事，每事给社员预支二十元；二、每年的“端午”、“中秋”、“春节”等较大节日，给社员预支些费用过节；三、社员平时买盐买烧柴和添置穿戴，依据困难大小，酌情预支。1955年解决社员这类问题，共预支一千二百五十五元，每户平均五元九角。
    单靠社里副业营利解决社员零花钱问题，毕竟还是有限的。因此，社管理委员会特别重视发动社员搞好家庭副业生产。根据这个社的条件，可以发展养猪和养鸡副业。开始社员缺乏养猪习惯，怕误工、怕麻烦，不愿养猪。社的工作人员专门总结了社员王清和养母猪得利的实例，向社员宣传。王清和养母猪两口，全年生猪娃四十八个，赚二百八十元。除家里开支和供给两个儿子念书外，还有剩余。以后，养猪户数逐年增多。现在全社除单身汉高四只等六户外，户户社员都养猪，喂鸡。1955年社员养猪、养鸡收入达7，385元，每户平均35元。
    再一个办法是鼓励社员积肥，合作社用当年一部分生产底垫费收买社员所积的羊粪。这样，社员都积极拾羊粪卖给社里，既增加了社的肥料，也使社员有了零花钱。现在已经用现款一百四十元收买了七千多斤羊粪。
    社管理委员会还注意组织社员花钱，帮助他们养成勤俭节约的习惯。常常向社员进行节约和爱国储蓄的教育。在夏收和秋收决算以后，发动社员将款存入农业合作社或信用合作社，需要零用和急用的时候随时支取。现在，社员不仅不再缺乏零花钱，而且有余钱存入农业社或信用社。
