Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 11th—Agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of Liuyang County, Hunan Province, are making full use of local natural conditions to develop a diversified economy.

　　Most of Liuyang County is mountainous and hilly. In addition to producing rice, it is also a famous camellia oleifera and tea producing area.

　　At present, agricultural production cooperatives are organizing a large number of members to weed and loosen the soil in the barren camellia forests to restore camellia production. Many agricultural production cooperatives in hilly areas have used relatively flat mountain land to plant ramie, jute, tobacco, mat grass and other cash crops. Some agricultural production cooperatives along rivers and small plains have used low-lying paddy fields to grow high-yield crops such as taro.

　　Since the beginning of spring this year, most agricultural production cooperatives in Liuyang County have concentrated their labor on rice production, lacking specific arrangements for other agricultural and sideline production. In early April, the Liuyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party discovered this problem and led the cooperatives to formulate a plan for the comprehensive development of a diversified economy, and quickly began to take action. Now, in addition to emphasizing the development of major cash crops, the county's agricultural production cooperatives are also engaged in more than 650 kinds of sideline production. Many members have recently raised pigs, chickens and ducklings.

    浏阳县重视发展多种经济
    据新华社长沙11日电　湖南省浏阳县各地农业生产合作社充分利用当地自然条件发展多种经济。
    浏阳县大部是山区和丘陵地区，除出产稻谷以外，还是有名的油茶产区和茶叶产区。
    目前，农业生产合作社正在组织大批社员在荒芜的油茶林里进行铲草，松土，恢复油茶生产。丘陵地区的很多农业生产合作社利用较平坦的山地播种了苎麻、黄麻、烟叶、席草等经济作物。一些沿河和小平原地区的农业生产合作社利用低洼水田栽种了高产作物——水芋头。
    浏阳县大部农业生产合作社今年入春以来都把劳力集中于稻谷生产上，对其他农副业生产缺乏具体安排。四月初中共浏阳县委发现了这一问题，领导各社制定了全面发展多种经济的计划，并迅速开始了行动。现在，全县农业生产合作社除重视了发展主要经济作物外，还经营着六百五十多种副业生产。许多社员最近养了猪，养了小鸡和小鸭。
