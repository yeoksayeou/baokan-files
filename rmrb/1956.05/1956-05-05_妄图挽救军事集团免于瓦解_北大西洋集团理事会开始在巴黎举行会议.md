Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch from Paris: The North Atlantic Group Council began a two-day meeting in Paris today. According to the group's Secretary-General, Ismail, the main purpose of this meeting is to discuss the recent changes in the international situation and strengthen the political and economic cooperation of the North Atlantic countries. Ismail also said: "It is impossible to expect this meeting to make any amazing decisions."

　　This military group is focusing on discussing the issue of "non-military cooperation" this time, which is the result of repeated insistence by countries such as Britain, France, Italy, and Canada. These countries believe that in order to adapt to the current international situation and save the North Atlantic Group from disintegration, military cooperation should not continue to be emphasized, but rather political and economic cooperation should be focused on. News revealed on the eve of the meeting said that under pressure from these countries, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles is prepared to propose a "four-point plan" at the meeting to win over U.S. allies with economic aid.

　　Before, during, and after this meeting, representatives of the countries participating in this group will also hold a series of meetings in Paris.

　　On May 2, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles and French Foreign Minister Pineau discussed "estimates of Soviet policy," the situation in the Near East, disarmament issues, the Algerian issue, and issues related to the North Atlantic Group Council meeting.

　　On May 3, Dulles and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd discussed the establishment of a new "inner cabinet" to save the North Atlantic Group. They also discussed the situation of the talks between Bulganin and Khrushchev and Eden during their visit to Britain, as well as the relaxation of trade embargoes, disarmament, and German reunification. On the same day, French Prime Minister Mollet and Foreign Minister Pineau held talks with West German Foreign Minister von Brentano on disarmament issues, German reunification, the Saar issue, and issues related to this Council meeting. In addition, Dulles also held separate talks with Brentano and Turkish Foreign Minister Koprulu. The "Western European Union" Council also held a meeting on this day.

　　The Foreign Ministers of Britain and France will meet today. According to Reuters, after the North Atlantic Council meeting ends on May 6, the Foreign Ministers of the United States, Britain, and France will hold formal talks, and at the same time, the ministers of the six member states of the "European Coal and Steel Community" will also meet.

    妄图挽救军事集团免于瓦解
　　北大西洋集团理事会开始在巴黎举行会议
    新华社4日讯　巴黎消息：北大西洋集团理事会今天开始在巴黎举行为期两天的会议。据这个集团的秘书长伊斯迈宣布，这次会议主要是讨论最近国际局势的变化和加强北大西洋国家的政治合作和经济合作的问题。伊斯迈还说：不可以期望这次会议作出惊人的决定来。
    这个军事集团这次要着重讨论“非军事性合作”问题，是英国、法国、意大利和加拿大等国家一再坚持的结果。这些国家认为，为适应目前国际局势和挽救北大西洋集团免于瓦解，不应该继续强调军事方面的合作，而应该侧重政治和经济方面的合作。在会议前夕透露出来的消息说，在这些国家的压力下，美国国务卿杜勒斯已经准备在会上提出一个“四点计划”以经济援助来拉拢美国的盟国。
    在这次会议的前后和会议期间，参加这个集团的各国代表还要在巴黎举行一系列会议。
    五月二日，美国国务卿杜勒斯和法国外交部长比诺在一起讨论了“对苏联政策的估计”、近东情况、裁军问题、阿尔及利亚问题和有关北大西洋集团理事会会议的问题。
    五月三日，杜勒斯和英国外交大臣劳埃德讨论了关于成立一个新的“核心内阁”以挽救北大西洋集团的问题。他们还谈到了布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访英期间同艾登会谈的情况以及放宽贸易禁运、裁军和德国统一问题等等。同一天，法国总理摩勒和外交部长比诺同西德外交部长勃伦塔诺就裁军问题、德国统一问题、萨尔问题和有关这次理事会会议的问题举行了会谈。此外，杜勒斯还同勃伦塔诺和土耳其外交部长柯普路鲁分别举行了会谈。“西欧联盟”理事会也在这一天举行了会议。
    英国和法国的外交部长将在今天会谈。据路透社消息，在五月六日，北大西洋理事会会议结束后，美、英、法三国的外交部长还要举行正式会谈，同时“欧洲煤钢联营”六个成员国的部长们也要开会。
