    Taiwan Tea Prices Plunge, Livelihoods of 600,000 Tea Farmers Threatened
    During the spring tea picking season, Taiwan tea prices have plummeted, threatening the livelihoods of 600,000 tea farmers.
    Taiwanese newspapers report that this year, the price of spring tea in Taiwan is 5 jiao (cents) in pseudo-Taiwan currency per jin (approximately 0.5 kg). This price is only one-third of last year's tea prices. The wages and food costs for picking each jin of tea alone amount to 4 jiao. Other transportation costs are not even included in this. Tea farmers are not only failing to profit, but are also suffering losses. Therefore, the second spring tea harvest has been widely and forcibly halted.
    News indicates that the Chiang Kai-shek clique levies heavy business taxes, port labor donations, and other fees on exported tea, increasing the cost of Taiwanese tea and making it unable to compete in the international market, resulting in export difficulties. This is the main reason for the plunge in Taiwan's spring tea prices. Tea has historically ranked third among Taiwan's export commodities. However, in 1955, Taiwan's tea exports decreased by 45% compared to 1954, and in the first half of this year, they sharply declined compared to the same period last year. It is estimated that Taiwan currently has over 10 million pounds of tea in stock, some of which has rotted due to prolonged storage. Taiwanese newspapers state that the livelihoods of Taiwanese tea farmers are currently under severe threat, and they are in a difficult situation.

    台湾茶叶价格暴跌，六十万茶农生活受威胁
    在采摘春茶的季节里，台湾茶叶价格暴跌，六十万茶农的生活受到威胁。
    台湾报纸说，今年台湾每斤春茶的价格是伪台币五角，这个价格只有去年茶价的三分之一。而采摘每斤茶叶的工资和伙食费就要四角，其他运费等还未计算在内，茶农们不但得不到利益，而且要亏本，因此今春二次采茶已普遍被迫停顿。
    消息说，蒋介石集团对出口茶叶征收苛重的营业税、港工捐等，增加了台湾茶叶的成本，使台茶无法在国际市场上竞争，造成输出困难，是台湾春茶价格暴跌的主要原因。台茶历年占台湾出口物资的第三位。但1955年台茶输出比1954年减少了45％，今年上半年又比去年同期锐减。据估计，目前台湾积存的茶叶约在一千万磅以上，其中一部分已因积存太久而腐烂。台湾报纸说，目前台湾茶农生活遭受严重威胁，处境困难。
