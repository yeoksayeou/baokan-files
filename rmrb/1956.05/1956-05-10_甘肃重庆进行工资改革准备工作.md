Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 8th. On the afternoon of the 7th, the Gansu Provincial Labor Bureau held its final discussion on the preliminary plan for the province's wage reform, which will soon be submitted to the Gansu Provincial People's Committee for discussion and then to the State Council for approval.

According to the provisions of this preliminary plan, the unreasonable and unbalanced wage standards currently existing in various factories, mines, and enterprises in Gansu Province will be resolved more reasonably, and the wages of employees will generally be increased.

Since the National Wage Conference, relevant units in Gansu Province have formed a wage reform office to prepare for wage reform. The Provincial Federation of Trade Unions held a wage work training class, training 80 grassroots trade union cadres and activists from various factories and mines. The Provincial Department of Industry recently also selected a group of administrative cadres from various factories and enterprises to study the basic theory of wage issues and the policies and specific practices of wage reform. The trade union is drafting a publicity outline to carry out publicity and education on wage reform among employees in factories and mines.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 9th. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China is leading various departments in studying the city's wage reform work.

The Chongqing Municipal Wage Reform Committee has been established. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China specifically discussed the steps to carry out this work and designated a responsible cadre to specifically lead the city's wage reform work. The Municipal Bureau of Statistics and the Planning Commission have provided a lot of reference materials related to the city's labor productivity and market prices.

In accordance with the spirit of the National Wage Conference and the wage reform plans formulated by the industrial departments in charge, large and medium-sized factories, mines, and enterprises have studied the improvement of labor productivity and the increase in actual wages in their respective units over the past year or so, and have initially calculated and determined the extent of the increase in the wage level of their units. Many factories and mines have also put forward specific measures and opinions to further ensure the overfulfillment of state plans after wage reform.

More than 700 cadres have been sent from factories, mines, and government agencies throughout the city to participate in wage reform cadre training classes.
