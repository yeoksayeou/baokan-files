Taiwan farmers are increasingly selling, transferring, and abandoning their farmland due to poverty, a situation that has become widespread throughout the island. This was recently revealed by a publication of the Chiang gang in Hong Kong.

The article stated that the phenomenon of unprecedented capital depletion has appeared in Taiwan's rural areas. The extent of rural bankruptcy in Taiwan is "shocking." The article revealed that the Chiang gang's frantic plunder of Taiwan farmers' grain and the suppression of agricultural product prices far below the prices of other essential daily necessities are important causes of this serious situation. The article cited investigation materials from the Chiang gang's Taiwan Provincial Assembly, illustrating that "Ba Ze Tian" (good rice paddy) in Taipei County produces approximately 5,200 kilograms of rice per hectare annually. However, the Chiang gang, under the names of land tax grain, grain collected with the tax, land price grain, fertilizer exchange grain, household tax, and water conservancy association fees, forces farmers to pay 3241.12 kilograms of rice per hectare. The remaining rice is only 1958.88 kilograms, and this is before deducting production costs. This means that the Chiang gang's plunder of grain under the above-mentioned tax names accounts for 62.3% of the total output, while the farmers' income, including production costs, accounts for only 37.7%.

The article did not mention the fact that the Chiang gang also frequently extorts grain from Taiwan farmers in the name of "military donations" and "contributing rice to build schools," and other similar pretexts.

The Chiang gang keeps the prices of rice and other agricultural products very low in Taiwan, making the prices of agricultural products, especially rice, far lower than those of industrial products and other daily necessities such as cloth and salt. This has increased the burden on Taiwan farmers, making their lives more difficult. The article stated that due to the Chiang gang's excessive grain exploitation and low rice prices, Taiwan farmers' interest in grain production has significantly declined. They are applying less fertilizer to rice paddies, and some rice farmers are even selling compost to miscellaneous crop farmers. Some farmers have converted rice paddies to grow sugarcane or other crops. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 台湾农民日益贫困

　　台湾农民日益贫困
    台湾农民因生活贫困而把耕地出卖、顶让和弃耕逃荒的情况，已在台湾全省各地普遍发生。这是在香港出版的一家蒋帮刊物最近透露的消息。
    这家刊物发表的一篇文章说，目前台湾农村中已呈现资金空前枯竭的现象。台湾农村破产的程度已令人“怵目惊心”。文章透露，蒋帮疯狂掠夺台湾农民的粮食，并且把农产品的价格压得远低于其他民生日用必需品的价格，是造成这种严重情况的重要原因。文章引用蒋帮台湾省议会的调查材料，说明台北县的“八则田”每公顷年产稻谷约五千二百公斤，而被蒋帮以田赋谷、随赋收购谷、地价谷、肥料换谷、户税、水利会费这几种名目，强令农民每公顷缴纳稻谷3241.12公斤，余下的稻谷只有1958.88公斤，而且还未扣除生产费用。即蒋帮用上述几种赋税名目掠夺的粮食占总产量62.3％，而农民所得连同生产费用在内只占37.7％。
    文章还没有提到这个事实：蒋帮还经常用“劳军捐献”、“斗米建校”等等名义向台湾农民勒索粮食。
    蒋帮在台湾把米和其他农产品的价格压得很低，使农产品价格尤其是米价远远低于工业品和其他生活必需品如布、盐等的价格，台湾农民因而增加了负担，生活更加困难。文章说，由于蒋帮搜刮粮食过重和米价过贱，台湾农民对生产粮食的兴趣已显著低落，对稻田都少施肥料，有些种植稻谷的农民甚至把堆肥转卖给什作农民。有些农民已把稻田改种甘蔗或其他农作物。　（新华社）
