Many outstanding young cultural, scientific, and technological workers in Nanjing have set personal plans. Yao Kaiji, a Grade One technician at a state-owned factory, is determined to reach the level of engineer within one year and the level of associate doctor in four to four and a half years. Wang Wenming of China Cement Factory, who joined the factory's mechanical equipment management work after graduating from a technical school in 1954, has now drawn up a seven-year plan, preparing to reach the level of mechanical engineer through amateur advanced studies. Lu Yurong, a national youth socialist construction activist and assistant teacher in the Meteorology Department of Nanjing University, is determined to strive to complete her associate doctoral thesis in 1960, so that she will initially have the ability to independently carry out scientific research work.

　　南京许多青年订出个人学习规划
    南京市许多优秀的青年文化科学技术工作者订出了个人规划。国营某厂一级技术员姚开基，决心在一年内达到工程师水平，在四年到四年半时间内达到副博士水平。中国水泥厂王文明，是1954年从技术学校毕业后参加厂内机械设备管理工作的，他现在订出了七年规划，准备通过业余进修达到机械工程师水平。全国青年社会主义建设积极分子、南京大学气象系助教陆渝蓉，决心争取在1960年完成副博士论文，使自己初步具有独立开展科学研究工作的能力。
