People from Sanmenxia

When I visited him, he waved his only right hand and said with a hearty laugh: This project is too large. In this huge project, I am currently only responsible for the task of erecting steel cable bridges. Although it is also troublesome to complete this task, it is very small compared to the huge Sanmenxia water conservancy project.

Xie Shixin, who grew up in the old society, had been building bridges on the banks of the Huai River and the Yangtze River for years since he was eighteen. In those years, it was not easy to support a family, and he often went hungry himself. In 1946, he drifted to Shanghai. The Kuomintang recruited workers to block the breach in the Huayuankou dam, and he signed up to work. Originally, he wanted to earn some money to return to his hometown in Shandong; but once he arrived there, it was like entering a living hell. The Kuomintang guarded them with soldiers, and they worked day and night, not only without a penny, but also without a full meal every day. Once, Xie Shixin was driving piles in waist-deep water when, due to overwork, his left hand was crushed by a large hammer. Xie Shixin's life, half-disabled, fell into despair from then on.

When he drifted penniless to Zhengzhou, the People's Liberation Army arrived. The next day, he signed up to join the Second Engineering Team of the Logistics Department of the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army. It was the season when flowers were flying everywhere in the south of the Yangtze River. Millions of troops marched south, and he followed the army, opening roads through mountains and building bridges across rivers. When the army advanced to Anhui Province, there was a river called Qili River, the water flow was very rapid, and the riverbed was full of quicksand. Heavy-duty vehicles could not pass, and a large number of military supplies were blocked on the bank of the river. The main force that had crossed the river had already reached the north bank of the Yangtze River, but the military grain could not be supplied. Based on the combat situation, the headquarters ordered the engineering team to build this bridge within twenty days. Could this bridge be built on schedule? Some people said: Bridges have been built in this place before, and construction has started six times, but it has never been completed. The main reason for the failure to build it is that there are eight feet of quicksand in the riverbed, and the piles cannot be driven in. Some engineering personnel who had just joined the work and understood bridge construction technology said: It would take at least two months to build a bridge that heavy-duty vehicles could pass on in this place.

At this time, Xie Shixin was leading a squad behind the engineering team. Zhang, the political commissar of the engineering team, knew that he had more than ten years of experience in bridge construction, so he notified him to hurry up and catch up.

After Lao Xie arrived at the engineering team, he immediately went to the river to see. After carefully examining it, he said firmly: "This bridge can be built." At that time, the leadership gave him a deadline of fifteen days to build the bridge, but he estimated that it would only take ten days. As a result, they only used a week and a half of work to build the bridge.

This morning he was sleeping soundly when Political Commissar Zhang woke him up and said: "Lao Xie, good job, from twelve o'clock last night until dawn, more than six hundred trucks have passed." In the afternoon, Political Commissar Zhang told him again: "There is a phone call from the Yangtze River, and the comrades in the army are eating dry food because the grain was delivered." Although Lao Xie was so tired that his whole body ached, he couldn't lie down any longer. He ran to the bridge to check the quality of the bridge. He met Commander Liu Bocheng who was walking across the bridge. Zhang, the political commissar who was also on the bridge at this time, pointed to Xie Shixin and said to Commander Liu: "This is Xie Shixin who completed the bridge construction task ahead of schedule!" Commander Liu said "Very good! Very good!" and took a photo of him with his camera.

When the Liberation Army advanced to Chongqing, the bridge construction projects decreased, and the engineering team also expanded compared to before. At this time, the rear needed people to manage the Yellow River, and Xie Shixin was transferred to the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission to participate in the construction of the People's Victory Canal. During this period, he was constantly praised by the leadership.

In 1954, the office building of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission began to be built. Lao Xie, who participated in this project, not only put forward many rationalization proposals to ensure the quality of the project, but also created a ash hoist that was eight and a half times more efficient than manual ash carrying at that time. Because of his loyalty to the Party's cause, he gloriously joined the Communist Party of China in 1954.

In July 1955, he went to work in the nationally famous Sanmenxia, and he said: "I am most fortunate in my life to be able to participate in this great project."

July on the Yellow River is the flood season, and the water in Sanmenxia began to rise. The Soviet expert team responsible for designing the Sanmenxia Hydro Junction was urgently waiting for the materials measured by the Sanmenxia Hydrological Station. Although it was very difficult to start work now, it could not be delayed, because if the hydrological survey was carried out after the flood season, the project would be stalled for a long time. At this time, the leadership decided to erect three steel cables, twenty-five centimeters thick, on the Sanmenxia River for hydrological survey to ensure that the experts could carry out the design work on schedule.

After Lao Xie accepted this task, he asked for four large boats and twenty-five workers who were proficient in swimming. The first steel cable was to be erected on Hongshi Slope. He led the workers to the river, checking the construction site and interviewing an old boatman with fifty years of experience in rowing. Lao Xie asked: "Can you row a boat across the river from here?" The old boatman looked at the nearly forty-year-old man standing in front of him and said: "Don't say a boat, even a sheepskin raft will be smashed to the point where you can't even see the shadow." Lao Xie was not intimidated by this difficulty. After continuous pondering and soliciting the opinions of other comrades, he finally came up with a solution. He suggested to the leadership to use a buoy launcher to hang a nine-centimeter steel cable on it and send it across the river bank. This suggestion was adopted. But after four or five consecutive tests, it did not succeed. Each time, before the launcher floated to the center of the river, it was swept away by the rapid current. At that time, someone said to him: "Lao Xie, you have to believe in science, don't use your brain blindly, wait for the water to drop before doing it!" Lao Xie did not listen to this warning, because he knew that doing this work was like fighting a war, and he must resolutely complete the task. He also thought: Chairman Mao is determined to control the Yellow River fundamentally because he believes in the power of the people! It is because he knows that there are Communist Party members working on the banks of the Yellow River. Thinking of this, his confidence in completing the task became even stronger. He said secretly: I can't wait for the water to drop, I must keep going!

After pondering over and over, he realized that the buoy launcher could not bring the steel cable across the river because the nine-centimeter steel cable was too heavy. Based on this understanding, he first used a buoy launcher to bring a five-centimeter steel cable across to the opposite bank, and then tied the nine-centimeter steel cable to the end of the five-centimeter steel cable, and then used a winch to pull the nine-centimeter steel cable to the opposite bank. In the same way, the twenty-five-centimeter steel cable was also pulled over. He also accepted the opinions of the masses and tied sheepskin rafts to the twenty-five-centimeter steel cable to make it easier to winch and pull the steel cable. In this way, the steel cable on this section was erected.

In order to be able to pull the other two twenty-five-centimeter thick steel cables across the river, he also suggested hanging a hanging basket on the already erected steel cable. At that time, an engineer named Pan disagreed. He said: "I'm afraid it won't work! It's not a joke to put such a hanging basket on it, if it turns over, it will be terrible." He advocated hanging sheepskin rafts. The engineering team began to experiment based on the engineer's opinion. The one hundred sheepskin rafts that were connected after two days of work had just floated into the river when they heard a "crack" and drifted away with the water.

After the method of hanging sheepskin rafts failed, Xie Shixin carried out the experiment of hanging a hanging basket according to his original idea. He asked the engineering team for some old boards and nailed a hanging basket by himself. With the assistance of comrades Cao Chuanyou and Wu Qingrang, the experiment was successful. The progress of the project was accelerated. A section that originally took six days to erect was now completed in three days.

They overcame difficulties, raced against time, and completed the task of obtaining hydrological data from Sanmenxia according to the requirements of the Soviet experts. At the same time, because the hanging basket he created was successfully tested, it not only reduced the time for people and goods to travel back and forth across the river, but also avoided the danger of crossing Sanmenxia by boat or sheepskin raft. People praised this as "crossing Sanmenxia in the air."

Before the freeze last year, the dam site drilling team of the Geological Exploration Team had three more boreholes urgently waiting to be started, but these boreholes were located at the confluence of Renmen, Guimen, and Shenmen, where the waves were surging and it was impossible to install drilling towers. They turned to Xie Shixin again for a solution. Xie Shixin suggested using the method of hanging a boat on a steel cable to solve the difficulty of installing drilling towers. As a result of adopting his suggestion, the drilling towers were successfully installed. The result of doing so not only ensured the timely completion of the drilling work, but also saved steel cables worth 40,000 yuan in Renminbi.

When Xie Shixin first came to work in Sanmenxia, many comrades under his leadership called him Comrade Xie. After some time, everyone called him Master Xie, because he taught them his skills without reservation in his work.

Xie Shixin is the deputy captain of the engineering team of the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau Office. When I visited him, he was in Beijing attending the National Conference of Advanced Producers Representatives.

    从三门峡来的人
    大群
    当我访问他的时候，他摆着仅有的一只右手，豁朗地笑着说：这个工程规模太大了。我在这个大工程中，目前只是担任架设钢索桥的任务。要完成这个任务虽然也很费事，但是和巨大的三门峡水利工程相比，就是很微小的了。
    生长在旧社会里的谢世新，十八岁就成年累月在淮河长江两岸架桥。在那种年月里不用说养家糊口，三天两头连自己都空着半个肚子。1946年他流落到上海，国民党招工堵花园口大堤缺口，他就报名去做工。本来他想赚点钱回山东老家；可是一到那里算是他进了活地狱，国民党用兵看守着，干活不分白天黑夜，不但一分钱不给，每天连顿饱饭也混不上。有一次，谢世新在没腰深的水里打桩子，由于过度劳累，被一个大锤轧了左手。半残废的谢世新的生活从此就陷于绝境了。
    当他无依无靠地流落到郑州的时候，解放军来了。他第二天就报名参加了解放军第二野战军后勤部的第二工程队。正是江南无处不飞花的季节，百万大军南下，他随军一路上逢山开路，遇水架桥。当大军挺进到安徽境内的时候，有一条名叫七里河的河，水流很急，河底又是流砂，载重汽车不能通行，大批军需物资被拦在河边。涉水过河的大部队已经到达长江北岸，可是军需的粮食却供应不上去。司令部根据作战情况，命令工程队在二十天内一定要把这座桥架起来。这座桥能不能如期架好呢？有人说：过去在这个地方也架过桥，曾经动工六次，可是始终没有修成。修不成的主要原因是河床有八尺深的流砂，打不住桩子。一些才参加工作的懂得架桥技术的工程人员说：在这个地方架设一座载重汽车可以通行的桥，最少也得两个月工夫。
    这时谢世新带着一个班走在工程队的后边。工程队的张政委知道他有十几年的架桥经验，就通知他快点赶到前面来。
    老谢赶到工程队以后，立即就到河边去看。他仔细地看了以后坚定地说：“这座桥可以架起来。”当时领导上给他架桥的期限是十五天，他估计有十天就可以了。结果他们仅仅用了一个星期零半宿的工夫，就把桥架起来了。
    这天早晨他睡得正香，张政委把他叫醒说：“老谢，成绩不错，由昨天夜里十二点到天亮，光汽车就过去了六百多辆啦。”到下午，张政委又告诉他：“长江边上来电话了，部队同志因为粮食送上去而吃上干饭了。”老谢虽然疲劳得混身酸痛，但是他再也躺不住了，他跑到桥上去检查桥的质量。他在桥上碰到步行过桥的刘伯承司令员。这时也在桥上的张政委指着谢世新对刘司令员说：“这就是提前完成架桥任务的谢世新！”刘司令员一面说着“很好！很好！”一面还用随身带着的照相机给他拍了一张照片。
    解放大军挺进到重庆的时候，架桥工程减少了，工程队也比以前扩大了。这时后方治理黄河又需要人，谢世新就在这种情况下被调到黄河水利委员会，参加了人民胜利渠的建筑工作。这期间，他不断地受到领导上的表扬。
    1954年黄河水利委员会的办公大楼开始兴建。参加这项工程的老谢，不但提出了很多合理化建议，保证了工程质量，还创造了比当时用人工揹灰效率高八倍半的吊灰架。由于他忠于党的事业，1954年他光荣地加入了中国共产党。
    1955年七月，他到了全国闻名的三门峡工作，他说：“我能参加这个伟大工程，是一生最大幸福。”
    黄河的七月，正是伏汛季节，三门峡的河水开始上涨。负责设计三门峡水力枢纽的苏联专家组，急等着三门峡水文站测验的材料。现在动手工作虽然非常困难，但是又不能推延，因为如果过了伏汛期再测验水文，那就要使工程停顿很久。这时领导方面决定在三门峡河面上架设三道二十五公分粗的钢缆来进行水文测验，保证专家能够按期进行设计工作。
    老谢接受了这个任务以后就要了四只大船，二十五个精通水性的工人。第一道钢缆要架设在红石坡。他带领工人到了河边，一边查看施工地址，一边访问一个有五十年撑船经验的老艄公。老谢问：“能不能从这里撑船过河？”老艄公看看站在他对面这个将近四十岁的人说：“别说是船，就是羊皮筏也会撞得连影子都看不到。”老谢并没有被这个困难吓住，经过他不断的琢磨和征求其他同志的意见，终于想出了办法。他向领导方面建议用浮标投掷器把九公分的钢缆挂在上面送过河岸。这个建议被采纳了。可是连着试验了四五次都没有成功。每次试验，投掷器还没有漂到河心，就被急流卷跑了。当时有人对他说：“老谢，你要相信科学，别瞎动脑筋了，等水落了再搞吧！”老谢没有听他的这种警告，因为他知道，做这工作跟打仗一样，一定要坚决完成任务。他还想：毛主席有决心根治黄河，就是他相信人民的力量大！就是他知道，在黄河边上，有共产党员在那里工作。他想到这里，完成任务的信心就更坚强了。他暗暗地说：不能等到水落，一定要干下去！
    他琢磨来琢磨去，了解到浮标投掷器不能把钢缆带过河去，原来是因为九公分的钢缆分量太重。他根据这种认识，就先用浮标投掷器把五公分钢缆带过对岸，然后再把九公分钢缆系在五公分钢缆这头，再利用绞车把九公分的钢缆也拉到了对岸。用同样方法，又把二十五公分的钢缆也拉了过去。他还接受了群众意见在二十五公分的钢缆上扎上羊皮筏，使钢缆便于绞拉。这样，便把这个断面的钢缆架设好了。
    为了能够让另外两根二十五公分粗的钢缆拉过河去，他又建议在已架好的钢缆上挂一个吊篮。当时一个姓潘的工程师不同意，他说：“恐怕不成吧！上这样的吊篮可不是闹着玩的，翻个筋斗就不得了。”他主张挂羊皮筏。工程队根据工程师的意见开始试验。费了两天工夫连结起来的一百个羊皮筏，才顺到河里不久，只听嘎叭一声就顺水漂走了。
    挂羊皮筏的办法失败以后，谢世新就根据他原来的想法来进行挂吊篮的试验。他向工程队要了些旧板子，亲手钉了个吊篮。在曹传友、吴清让两个同志协助下试验成功了。工程的进度加快了。原先要六天架设的一个断面，现在三天就完成了。
    他们战胜了困难，争取了时间，按苏联专家的要求，完成了取得三门峡水文资料的任务。同时，因为他所创造的这个吊篮试验成功，不但减少了往返两岸过人运物的时间，还避免了乘船或坐羊皮筏过三门峡的危险。人们都称赞这是“空中过三门”。
    去年封冻以前，地质勘探总队的坝址钻探队还有三个钻孔急待开工，可是这些钻孔设在人门、鬼门、神门汇流的地方，波浪奔腾，无法安装钻塔。他们又找谢世新想办法。谢世新建议使用在钢缆上挂船办法来解决安装钻塔的困难。由于采用了他的建议，顺利地安装了钻塔。这样做的结果，不仅保证了钻探工作及时完成，并且节约了价值人民币四万元的钢缆。
    谢世新刚到三门峡工作的时候，在他领导下的许多同志都叫他谢同志，过了一些时候以后，大家都叫他谢师傅了，因为他在工作中毫无保留地把技术教给他们了。
    谢世新是三门峡工程局办事处工程队的副队长。我访问他的时候，他正在北京出席全国先进生产者代表会议。
