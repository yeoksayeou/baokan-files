Nine long-form Pingtans based on famous classical literature and beautiful folk legends, as well as the essence of other traditional Pingtan repertoire, have been organized by the Shanghai People's Pingtan Troupe.

Long-form Pingtans such as "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Water Margin," "The Palace of Eternal Life," and "Legend of the White Snake," as well as traditional Pingtan repertoire such as "Seeking Rain at Xuandu Temple" and "Judging a Case in the Flower Hall," have been performed by Pingtan artists among the people for one to two hundred years. They possess beautiful artistic language and have become excellent examples of oral folk literature. In this organization effort, the Shanghai People's Pingtan Troupe has preserved the original essence in terms of linguistic art; and boldly affirmed the progressive and popular elements in the content, while discarding feudal, superstitious, and erotic parts. The shortcomings of the old Pingtan structure, which was chaotic and had complex themes, have also been corrected. In the old version of the "Legend of the White Snake" Pingtan, the personalities of the three main characters, Bai Niangzi, Xiao Qing, and Xu Xian, were inconsistent. The old version also had excessive detail and neglected the main conflict and the sharpness of the struggle. After the organization, these shortcomings have been corrected, supplemented, and processed as necessary. The performances of the organized programs have been praised by the audience.

    整理评弹艺术遗产
    九部以古典文学名著和美丽的民间传说为内容的长篇评弹及其他评弹传统书目的精华，已经由上海市人民评弹工作团整理出来。
    “三国”、“水浒”、“长生殿”、“白蛇传”等长篇评弹以及“玄都求雨”、“花厅评理”等评弹的传统书目，都已经由评弹艺人们在民间演唱了一、二百年，它们有优美的艺术语言，已经成为优秀的民间口头文学。上海市人民评弹工作团在这次整理中，从语言艺术上保存了原有的精华；从内容上大胆地肯定了其中具有进步性和人民性的部分，扬弃了封建、迷信、色情的部分。旧的评弹结构混乱、主题庞杂的缺点，也得到了改正。在弹词“白蛇传”的旧本中，白娘子、小青、许仙三个主要人物的性格是前后不统一的，旧本中还对细节渲染过多，忽略了主要矛盾及斗争尖锐的地方。经过整理，对这些缺点都作了必要的修改、补充和加工。整理以后的节目演出时，都受到了听众的赞许。
