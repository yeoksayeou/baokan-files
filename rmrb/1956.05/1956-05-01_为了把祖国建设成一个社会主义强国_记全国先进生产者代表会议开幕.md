    To Build Our Motherland into a Socialist Power
    -- On the Opening of the National Conference of Advanced Producers' Representatives
    By Our Correspondent
    The working people of our country are writing an immortal work – the history of building socialism – with their diligent hands, intelligent minds, and creative enthusiasm at their respective posts.
    The more than six thousand advanced producers attending the National Conference of Advanced Producers' Representatives are the most active participants in writing this history. Each of them – whether steelworkers or scientists, machine workers or miners, geological prospecting team members or textile workers... has come to Beijing from all over the country with new records and new work achievements.
    At four o'clock in the afternoon on April 30th, the conference opened. Comrade Mao Zedong and other leaders of the Party Central Committee and the government entered the venue. The whole audience applauded and cheered for a long time, welcoming this strong collective. It is this collective that has educated all advanced producers; it is this collective that leads the people of the whole country in doing things that our predecessors have never done.
    At the conference, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, called on all advanced producers and all working people to work harder to build our country into a socialist power. The representatives responded with applause, expressing their determination and strength to work with the people of the whole country to accomplish this great cause.
    It has been almost seven years since the first five-star red flag was raised in front of Tiananmen Square. Seven years is only an instant in the century of mankind. The pine trees planted seven years ago have not yet grown up, and the babies born seven years ago have not yet entered school. However, in this short period of time, the face of our country has been changing with each passing day. Anshan, the steel capital, is supplying more and more steel to production enterprises and construction sites across the country. The First Automobile Works has been completed. The construction of new steel bases in Wuhan and Baotou has begun. The engineering geological exploration work for the massive water conservancy project at Sanmenxia has also been completed. The two bridge piers of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge are emerging from the river surface. The Baoji-Chengdu Railway is passing through the perilous Qinling Mountains. Campfires of survey teams are burning in the Gobi Desert. Iron towers for drilling are standing atop the Altai Mountains. Convoys of vehicles are speeding day and night on the Kangding-Tibet Highway and the Qinghai-Tibet Highway. Loggers' axes and saws are reaching into the virgin forests of the Greater Khingan Mountains.
    This great cause is connected with the activities of every advanced producer. Let's get to know Cao Shude! He sits quietly in a corner of the venue, listening to the report. He joined the Shiquan Hydrological Station in January 1954. At that time, his task was to observe the water level of the Han River at a place called Huoshiyan. Here, there are few families within dozens of miles. Looking up, you see mountain peaks; looking down, you see flowing water; and you hear the howling of leopards. In such an environment, he still enthusiastically walked along the thirty-one water gauges every day, watching the changes in the water level and recording various numbers in his notebook.
    In September, it rained for many days in a row, and mountain floods poured into the Han River, the sound like mountains collapsing. However, Cao Shude was excited in his heart: the more water, the greater the electricity generation. At night, he carried a kerosene lamp and walked into the storm, carefully watching the changes in the numbers on the water gauges.
    One night, he discovered that four water gauges had been washed away. He found some water gauges and wanted to re-insert them. But the water was very high, and he knew that he could not stand firm in such water. So he found a rope, tied one end to a tree, and the other end around his waist, and jumped towards a rock that he was very familiar with but was submerged by the water. Unexpectedly, he fell into the deep water. Dirty water poured into his mouth. He hurriedly pulled the rope and climbed ashore. After a while, he jumped down again, exploring the gaps in the pile of rocks and re-inserted the water gauges. At the most dangerous moment, his wife stood on the shore, holding the rope tied to him with one hand and holding the kerosene lamp with the other, helping him with his work.
    From the 8th to the 21st, for thirteen days and nights, he stayed on the banks of the Han River, rarely returning to the house. When the water was high, he changed his work schedule, observing the changes in the water level every twenty minutes. In the first few days, his wife brought him food. Later, the stored grain ran out, and all roads to the outside world were cut off by the flood. Hunger and fatigue tormented him. He often sat on the shore dozing off, vaguely feeling that the flood was coming again, and suddenly stood up. He persisted like this, and he accurately recorded the changes in the water level like this.
    In our construction ranks, there are thousands upon thousands of people like Cao Shude, who overcome the various difficulties brought to us by nature with their indomitable spirit. Our construction undertaking also encounters many difficulties in technology. We have to build many new factories, start many new machines, and manufacture many new products. Mastering these new technologies is very difficult for us, but our working people are studying diligently and learning very well.
    In January 1955, Liu Yaozong, a young worker of twenty-two, came to the First Automobile Works. He saw all kinds of new machine tools and felt that he had entered a new world of mechanical industry. The skills he had learned next to the belt lathe in the private factory in the past were of little use.
    Soon, he was transferred to the technician training team to learn to be an adjuster. The adjuster is the guide for the production workers. He has to adjust the machine tool, the tool, and make the first qualified product. This requires learning many specialized subjects such as mechanical drawing, process technology, material science, and tolerance coordination. For Liu Yaozong, these were all difficult, and the most difficult was mechanical drawing, where he always scored only two points in the exams.
    He examined the reasons why he could not learn well and found that it was because his mathematical foundation was too shallow. So he asked the teachers and comrades for advice. At night, he often recited various mathematical formulas under the light of the corridor until late at night. He got up very early in the morning and grabbed the math textbook to read again. After four months of hard study, he passed all the courses in the graduation exam.
    He was assigned to the column tooth workshop of the chassis workshop to do adjustment work. At first, he didn't know where to start. At this time, the workshop organized the study of adjustment theory, with adjusters who had returned from internships in the Soviet Union giving lectures. Liu Yaozong read the machine tool manual repeatedly every day. Whenever other work sections adjusted machine tools and tools, he always crowded around to watch carefully. While watching, he tested himself: What should I do? It should be like this. When the actions of others were the same as his ideas, he was secretly happy. When he found that the actions of others were different from his ideas, he immediately asked: Why is this? His notebook was filled with such insights.
    In the "Adjust 100 Machine Tools Without Accidents" competition launched in the work section, Liu Yaozong created a new record of adjusting one hundred and fifty machine tools without accidents.
    Not only in factories, but also at construction sites, there are many such advanced producers. Even in every work post in non-production departments, there are many advanced workers who also dedicate all their energy to this great socialist construction cause.
    Zhong Zheying, the head nurse and midwife of the Jixi Mining Bureau Staff Hospital, is one of them. Whether it is caring for patients or delivering babies for the families of employees, she always thinks: Being able to help an employee recover quickly to health, being able to have a baby born smoothly, filling their families with joy, and allowing every miner to have a healthy body and go down the well in a happy mood – isn't this also a contribution to the socialist construction cause?
    One day in May 1955, an ambulance brought in a pregnant woman with dystocia. She had been in pain at home for several days and could not give birth. After the woman was admitted to the hospital, she screamed desperately. Her husband, a miner, paced anxiously beside her. The doctor's diagnosis was that a cesarean section was necessary, and it was difficult to guarantee whether the child would live. The woman and her husband said in unison: "Operate quickly, doctor! As long as the adult lives."
    Zhong Zheying was the assistant during the operation. The child was quickly taken out. The woman calmed down. At this time, she thought of the child, "Why doesn't the child cry?" she asked the doctor. How eager this middle-aged woman was to have a child!
    However, the child's stomach was filled with amniotic fluid and meconium, and there was no sign of life. Several nurses tried their best to resuscitate, but it was still ineffective. The woman anxiously shouted again: "Quickly save my child!" When everything seemed hopeless, Zhong Zheying couldn't stay on the operating table. She quickly walked to the child, looked at the child, felt that there was still hope, immediately put her mouth tightly against the child's mouth, and sucked hard, sucking out the amniotic fluid and meconium little by little, and then used her mouth to help the child breathe. The child slowly began to move, and cried out with a "wah." The woman happily shouted: "Cried! Cried!"
    Zhong Zheying always treated every woman and every patient like a family member. She had stayed by the side of critically ill patients day and night, and she had drawn more than 2,000 CC of fresh blood from her own body to transfuse to patients, helping dying patients to survive the dangerous period.
    Our advanced producers treat the socialist construction cause like this. Together with all the workers and engineering technicians, they put forward the guarantee to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and are working hard to realize this guarantee. In realizing this guarantee, they are not satisfied with the existing achievements. I remember that at the banquet on the closing day of the National Conference of Advanced Producers of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, several advanced producers of national blast furnaces walked up to Li Qingzhen, a miner from the Nanfen Iron Mine in Benxi, raised their glasses and said: "Master Li, we have no other requirements, we need ore. We hope that you produce one thousand tons for us every shift."
    Li Qingzhen, this old miner, had gradually increased his daily output per shift from 90 tons to 600 tons after fighting against various conservative ideas for eight months, exceeding the 1956 quota by more than twelve times, and creating the highest record for mining in the country. At this time, he stood up, thought for a moment, raised his glass, and said decisively: "Okay!"
    When Li Qingzhen came to Beijing from Benxi to attend the National Conference of Advanced Producers' Representatives this time, his mining record per shift had already increased to 750 tons. Like other advanced producers, he is constantly moving forward on the basis of victory and constantly achieving new achievements.
    When our country was recovering production and starting construction, some people used to ridicule us: China, after a long period of war and catastrophe, is no longer a good soil for establishing a golden age. But what are the facts? Our golden age has already begun and is becoming more and more brilliant. We have the confidence and the strength to build our motherland into a socialist power.

    为了把祖国建设成一个社会主义强国
    ——记全国先进生产者代表会议开幕
    本报记者
    我国的劳动人民，正在自己的工作岗位上，用勤劳的双手，用智慧的头脑，用创造的热情，写着一部不朽的著作——建设社会主义的历史。
    出席全国先进生产者代表会议的六千多名先进生产者，是撰写这部历史的最积极的参与者。他们每一个人——不管是炼钢工人或科学家，机器工人或矿工、地质勘探队员或纺织女工……从全国各地带着新的纪录，新的工作成绩来到北京。
    四月三十日下午四时，大会开幕了。毛泽东同志和党中央的、政府的其他领导人员走进了会场。全场的人长久地鼓掌、欢呼，欢迎这个坚强的集体。是这个集体教养了全体先进生产者；是这个集体领导着全国人民做着我们前人没有做过的事。
    大会上，刘少奇同志代表党中央号召全体先进生产者和全体劳动人民更加努力，把我们的国家建设成一个社会主义强国。代表们用掌声来表示他们有决心、有力量和全国人民一起来完成这个伟大的事业。
    从天安门前升起第一面五星红旗那天开始，到现在快七年了。七年，在人类的世纪中只是一个瞬间，七年前栽下的松树还没有长大，七年前诞生的婴儿还没有进入学校，但是，在这短短的时间里，我们国家的面貌日新月异。钢都鞍山向全国生产企业和建筑工地输送的钢材越来越多。第一汽车制造厂已经建成。武汉和包头新的钢铁基地的建设工作已经开始。三门峡巨大水力枢纽的工程地质勘探工作也已结束。武汉长江大桥的两个桥墩露出江面。宝成铁路穿过天险秦岭。戈壁滩上燃起了普查队野营的篝火。阿尔泰山之颠竖起了钻探的铁塔。大队的汽车在康藏公路和青藏公路上日夜奔驰。伐木者的斧锯伸向大兴安岭的处女林。
    这个伟大的事业是和每一个先进生产者的活动连在一起的。让大家认识一下曹树德吧！他静静地坐在会场的一角，听着报告。他是在1954年1月参加石泉水文站的工作的。当时，他的任务是在一个叫火石岩的地方观测汉水的水位。这里，周围几十里地很少人家，抬头看见的是山峰，低头看见的是流水，他听见的是豹子的嚎叫。在这样的环境里，他每天仍然兴致勃勃地在三十一个水尺旁奔走着，看着水位的变化，在小本子上记下各种各样的数字。
    九月，连着下了好多天雨，山洪向汉水倾泻，声音像是山峰倒了下来。但是，曹树德的心里却是兴奋的：水愈多，电量愈大。夜里，他提着马灯，迎着风暴走去，细看水尺上数字的变化。
    一天夜里，他发现有四根水尺被冲走了。他找了几根水尺，想重新插上。但是水很大，他知道在这样的水里是站不住脚的，便找了根绳子，一头拴在树上，一头捆在腰里，朝一块他很熟悉的、而被水淹没了的石头跳去。那知竟掉在深水里，浑水灌进他的嘴里，他急忙拉着绳子爬上岸来，不一会儿又跳了下去，在石堆里探索空隙，重新把水尺插上。在最危险的时候，他爱人在岸上一只手拉住系着他的绳子，一只手提着马灯，帮助他工作。
    从八号到二十一号，整整十三个昼夜，他一直死守在汉水岸边，很少回到屋子里去。水大的时候，他改变了自己的工作时间，每二十分钟观测一次水位的变化。开始几天，他爱人还给他送饭吃。后来，储备的粮食吃光了，同外界联系的一切道路都被洪水切断了。饥饿、疲劳折磨着他，他常常坐在岸上打瞌睡，迷迷糊糊地感到洪水又来了，猛地站起来。他就这样坚持，他就这样正确地记录下了水位变化的情况。
    在我们建设的行列里，有千千万万像曹树德这样的人，他们用坚韧不拔的精神，克服着大自然给我们带来的各种各样困难。我们的建设事业，在技术方面同样遇到许多困难。我们要建设许多新的工厂，要开动许多新的机器，要制造许多新的产品，掌握这些新的技术，对我们说来都是很艰苦的，但是，我们的劳动人民刻苦地学习着，而且学得很好。
    1955年1月，二十二岁的青年工人刘耀宗来到第一汽车制造厂。他看到各种新机床，觉得自己是走进了一个新的机械工业的天地，过去在私营厂皮带车床旁边所学的本领没有多大用处了。
    不久，他被调到技工培训队去学做调整工。调整工是生产工人的带路人，他要调整好机床、刀具、做出第一个合格产品。这就必须学会机械制图、工艺学、材料学、公差配合等许多专门的学问。对刘耀宗说来，这些都是困难的，而最困难的是机械制图，每次考试总是二分。
    他检查了一下学不好的原因，发现是因为数学根底太浅，就向老师、向同志们请教。晚上，他常常在走廊的灯光下背诵着各种数学的公式，直到深夜。早上很早就爬起来，抓起数学课本又看。经过四个月的苦读，毕业考试时，全部功课都及格了。
    他被分配到底盘工部齿轮车间柱齿工段去做调整工作。开始，他不知道从何下手。这时车间里组织了调整理论的学习，由从苏联实习回来的调整工讲课。刘耀宗每天都拿着机床说明书，反复阅读。每当别的工段调整机床和刀具时，他总是凑过去，仔细地看。一面看，一面考自己：应该怎么办呢？应该是这样的。当别人的动作同他的想法一样时，他暗暗地高兴；发现别人的动作和自己的想法不一样，他马上去问：这是为什么？他的本子上记满了这样的心得。
    在工部开展“调整百台次无事故”的竞赛中，刘耀宗创造了调整一百五十台次无事故的新纪录。
    不但在工厂里，在建筑工地上，有许多这样的先进生产者，就是在非生产部门的每一个工作岗位上，也有许多先进工作者，他们同样把全部精力贡献给这个伟大的社会主义建设事业。
    鸡西矿务局职工医院的护士长、助产士锺哲影就是其中的一个。无论是护理病人，或者是给职工家属接生，她总是想着：能够使一个职工很快地恢复健康，能够使一个婴儿顺利地诞生，使他们的家庭充满了欢乐，让每一个矿工有着健康的身体，怀着愉快的心情走下井去，这不也是对社会主义建设事业的贡献吗？
    1955年5月里的一天，急救车送来一个难产的孕妇。她在家里疼了好几天，总是生不下来。产妇进院后，死命地叫喊，她的丈夫——一个矿工在旁边焦急地转来转去。大夫诊断的结果，必须切腹，孩子能不能活还很难担保。产妇和她的丈夫异口同声地说：“快开刀吧！大夫。只要大人活着就行。”
    动手术的时候，锺哲影是助手。孩子很快被取出来了。产妇安静下来，这时，她想起了孩子，“孩子为什么不哭呢？”她问大夫。这个中年妇人是多么渴望有一个孩子呵！
    可是，孩子的肚子里灌满了羊水和胎粪，已经没有一线生息。几个护士用尽一切方法急救，仍然无效。产妇又焦急地喊着：“快把我的孩子救活呵！”在这一切似乎都已绝望了的时候，锺哲影在手术台上呆不住了。她很快走到孩子跟前，看了看孩子，觉得还有希望，马上把嘴紧紧靠上孩子的嘴，用力吸，把羊水和胎粪一点一点吸出来，接着又用嘴帮着孩子呼吸。孩子慢慢开始挪动了，哇的一声哭了起来。产妇高兴地叫道：“哭了！哭了！”
    锺哲影总是这样像亲人一样对待每一个产妇、每一个病人。她曾不分昼夜地守在重患者的身旁，她曾从自己身上抽了二千多CC鲜血输给病人，使垂死的病人度过危险期。
    我们的先进生产者，就是这样对待社会主义建设事业的。他们和全体工人、工程技术人员在一起，提出了提前完成第一个五年计划的保证，并且努力实现这个保证。他们在实现这个保证中，是不满足于现有的成就的。记得，在重工业部先进生产者代表大会闭幕当天的宴会上，全国高炉的几位先进生产者走到本溪南芬铁矿矿工李庆振的面前，举起酒杯说道：“李师傅，我们没有别的要求，我们需要矿石，希望你每一台班为我们生产一千吨。”
    李庆振这位老矿工，是在同各种保守思想斗争了八个月之后，把每台班的日产量从九十吨逐步提高到六百吨，突破1956年的定额十二倍以上，创造了全国采矿的最高纪录的。这时，他站了起来，思索了一下，举起酒杯，果断地说道：“行！”
    当这一次，李庆振从本溪来到北京参加全国先进生产者代表会议时，他的每台班的采矿纪录已经提高到七百五十吨。他和其他先进生产者一样，在胜利的基础上不断前进，不断获得新的成就。
    当我们国家在恢复生产和开始建设的时候，有人曾经讥笑我们：中国经由长期的战争浩劫后，已经不是一块建立黄金时代的良好土壤了。可是，事实怎样呢？我们的黄金时代早已开始，而且越来越辉煌了。我们有信心，有力量把我们的祖国建设成一个社会主义强国。
