    The work of preventing and treating wheat midge in Shaanxi Province has come to an end. Leadership at all levels and many agricultural cooperatives have attached great importance to this work, resulting in significant achievements. According to information from 56 counties and cities in Guanzhong and southern Shaanxi, over 1.6 million mu of wheat fields severely affected by the pest were treated with 666 pesticide dust, eliminating the insect. According to comrades from the Agricultural Technology Promotion Department of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture, the treated wheat fields are expected to yield an average of at least 40 jin of wheat per mu. Based on the treated area of over 1.6 million mu, this could result in an increased wheat production of over 65 million jin for the entire province.

    This year, Shaanxi Province vigorously carried out farmland irrigation work. By the end of April, the province had increased its irrigated area by more than 2.15 million mu, which is 3% more than the total increase in irrigated area in the six years since liberation. Among them, the twenty state-owned canals alone increased the irrigated area by more than 410,000 mu. In addition to opening more branch canals and tributaries, the expansion of irrigated area by state-owned canals mainly relies on planned water use, which can also promote high and stable yields of crops.
    In the high tide of agricultural cooperation, the enthusiasm of the masses for farmland irrigation work has reached an unprecedented level. According to statistics, from January to April, the masses dug more than 83,000 wells, which is more than 10,000 wells more than the total number of wells dug in the six years since liberation.

    陕西广大地区扑灭了小麦吸浆虫害
    全省修渠打井增加灌溉面积二百多万亩
    陕西省全省防治小麦吸浆虫工作已经结束。各级领导机关和许多农业社都很重视这一工作，所以得到很大成就。根据关中、陕南五十六个县市的了解，各地受虫害比较严重的一百六十多万亩麦田，全部用六六六毒土进行了防治，消灭了虫害。据陕西省农业厅农业技术推广处的同志说：今年防治过的麦田，平均每亩至少可以保产四十斤小麦，全省以防治过的一百六十多万亩麦田来计算，就可以保产六千五百多万斤小麦。

    今年陕西省大力开展了农田水利工作，到四月底为止，全省已经增加了灌溉面积215万多亩，比解放后六年来增加灌溉面积的总数还要多3％；其中仅二十条国营渠道就增加了灌溉面积四十一万多亩。国营渠道扩大灌溉面积的方法除了增开分渠、支渠以外，主要靠计划用水的方法，计划用水还可以促使农作物获得高额而稳定的产量。
    在农业合作化高潮中，群众对农田水利工作的积极性空前高涨。据统计，一至四月份群众共打井八万三千多眼，比解放后六年来打井总数还要多一万多眼。
