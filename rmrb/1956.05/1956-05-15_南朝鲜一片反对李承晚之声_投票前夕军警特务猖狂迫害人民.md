Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 14th: The so-called "general election" in South Korea is to be held tomorrow. According to a dispatch from the International News Service from Seoul on May 14th, "Today in Seoul, South Korea, a general sentiment of opposition to Syngman Rhee's eight-year rule over South Korea is very strong and openly expressed."

Talks by several voters from all walks of life in the Seoul area to the International News Service reporter showed that behind the superficial calm of this city, there is a general dissatisfaction with the current government among the residents, and few people are unwilling to emphasize their opposition to Syngman Rhee.

On the eve of the voting, the activities of Syngman Rhee's military police and secret agents have become increasingly rampant. On May 13th, the Republican Party's vice presidential candidate, Lee Bum-suk, and his entourage were severely beaten by about 300 Syngman Rhee's secret agents who arrived in six trucks at a rally in Chuncheon. The venue was destroyed, and loudspeakers and cars were also smashed. Leading personnel of the Progressive Party were also repeatedly beaten by Syngman Rhee's secret agents on the mornings of May 12th and 13th, election workers were arrested, and the party's local offices were looted.

Under the rampant activities of Syngman Rhee's secret agents, on May 14th, another self-proclaimed independent vice presidential candidate, Lee Jong-tae, withdrew from the election. Prior to this, the Progressive Party's presidential candidate, Cho Bong-am, had gone into hiding for fear of being assassinated by Syngman Rhee's secret agents, and the Progressive Party's vice presidential candidate, Park Ki-chul, had also withdrawn from the election.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 13th: Seoul news: The president of the Confucian organization "Yudohoe" in South Korea issued a statement on May 12th, saying that Syngman Rhee's rule is a corrupt and incompetent bureaucratic autocracy. In this election, anti-dictatorial forces must unite to thwart Syngman Rhee's conspiracy to continue to hold power. The Christian United Comrades Association and the Korean Buddhist Jogye Order, etc., also issued statements opposing the election of Syngman Rhee and his follower Lee Ki-poong as president and vice president.

At a representative meeting held on May 7th, the Independent Labor and Farmers Party of South Korea passed a resolution expressing opposition to Syngman Rhee's fascist rule and not supporting Syngman Rhee in the election. More than 30 middle-of-the-road and right-wing figures belonging to the former Korean Independence Party and the former Socialist Party also unanimously expressed their non-support for Syngman Rhee's continued rule. More than fifty members of the Korean Democratic Party resigned en masse because they disagreed with supporting Syngman Rhee, leaving this party, which originally had very few members, almost existing in name only.

    南朝鲜一片反对李承晚之声
    投票前夕军警特务猖狂迫害人民
    新华社平壤14日电　南朝鲜的所谓普选明天就要举行了。据国际新闻社五月十四日从汉城发出的消息说，“今天在南朝鲜的汉城，普遍反对李承晚对南朝鲜八年统治的情绪十分强烈而且形于辞色。”
    汉城地区各阶层若干选民对国际新闻社记者的谈话表明：在这个城市的表面平静的后面，在居民中存在着对现政府的普遍不满，很少有人不愿意强调说明他们的反对李承晚的看法。
    在投票的前夕，李承晚的军警和特务的活动已愈来愈猖獗。共和党副总统候选人李范奭和他的随行人员五月十三日在春川的一个集会上，被用六辆卡车装来的约三百名李承晚的特务毒打了一顿，会场被捣毁，扩音机和汽车也被击毁。进步党的负责人员也在五月十二日和十三日早晨接连受到李承晚特务的殴打，竞选工作人员遭到逮捕，党的地方办公处遭到抢劫。
    在李承晚特务横行的情况下，五月十四日又有一个号称独立的副总统候选人李锺泰退出竞选。在此以前，进步党的总统候选人曹奉岩因为害怕遭李承晚特务暗杀，已经躲藏起来，进步党的副总统候选人朴己出也已经退出竞选。
    新华社平壤13日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜的儒教信徒组织儒道会会长在五月十二日发表声明说，李承晚统治是腐败无能的官僚专制政治。在这次选举中，反独裁的势力必须团结起来，粉碎李承晚继续掌握政权的阴谋。基督教联合同志会和大韩佛教曹溪宗信徒会等也分别发表声明，反对选举李承晚和他的追随者李起鹏为总统和副总统。
    南朝鲜的独立劳农党在五月七日召开的代表会议上通过一项决议，表示反对李承晚的法西斯统治，并且在选举中不支持李承晚。属于前韩国独立党和前社会党的中间和右翼人士三十多人也一致表示不支持李承晚继续执政。朝鲜民主党的五十多个党员因为不同意支持李承晚而一齐退党，使得这个人数本来很少的党因此几乎徒存空名。
