Editorial:

    Over the past six months, many rural Party grassroots organizations, in conjunction with the establishment and consolidation of cooperatives, have carried out Party building and rectification, and have gradually learned to continuously enhance the positive role of Party members and overcome negative and backward phenomena among Party members in various routine tasks. After joining the cooperatives, Party members' individual interests have become more aligned with the collective interests of the cooperatives due to changes in their individual small-peasant economic status. Through collective operation and labor, the possibility of strengthening collectivist ideology has increased. The gradual implementation of diversified operations in cooperatives has also provided Party members with better conditions for carrying out activities and playing a positive role within the cooperatives. At the same time, because the success or failure of cooperatives is closely related to the lives of the vast majority of members, the broad masses of members demand that Party grassroots organizations lead everyone in running the cooperatives well and that Party members play a positive role. Thus, the supervision of the Party by the masses has been further strengthened. All of these provide favorable conditions for enhancing the positive role of Party members in cooperatives. However, to make these favorable conditions effective, much ideological and organizational work must be carried out within the Party.

    In future Party rectification work, we should continue to conduct socialist education for Party members to raise their socialist consciousness. In the past, when Party rectification was carried out in conjunction with the establishment and consolidation of cooperatives, the main focus was on the concentrated criticism of certain Party members' capitalist ideas and exploitative behaviors. After the criticism, a small number of Party members with capitalist exploitative behaviors abandoned exploitation. The vast majority of Party members who had not joined the cooperatives joined them, which shows that the past work was successful. The current situation is that some Party members, especially those who have assumed leadership positions in agricultural cooperatives, manage the cooperatives with capitalist management methods, fail to comply with national production plans, and fail to fulfill pre-purchase contracts. Some Party members, after assuming leadership positions in agricultural cooperatives, cannot correctly implement the policy of diligence and frugality in running the cooperatives, are extravagant and wasteful, pursue ostentation, and do not care about the hardships of poor members, and are unwilling to listen to members' opinions, causing concerns and dissatisfaction among the members. Some Party members manage the cooperatives with methods of managing small-peasant economies, fail to make full use of the superior conditions of the cooperative economy to formulate advanced production plans, and are unwilling to study and adopt new production technologies and advanced management methods. In addition, a more common phenomenon is the selfish and self-interested individualism of Party members within the cooperatives, who only seek to obtain more work points for themselves, disregard production quality, and damage public property, which directly harms the interests of the members. These Party members with capitalist management ideas, conservative and backward ideas, and selfish and self-interested individualistic ideas, although still a minority in a grassroots organization, directly weaken the Party's leadership over the cooperatives. Therefore, in future Party rectification work, we must organize and rely on the positive forces within the Party to continuously criticize these ideas and behaviors, educate Party members to master the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and carry out ideological criticism within the Party at any time to solve the ideological problems of these Party members.

    Strengthening ideological education for backward Party members is also one of the contents of future Party rectification. After more than half a year of the collectivization movement, Party members who were originally active have become more active, and most of the Party members who were backward and unable to play their due role have become active. However, there are still some Party members who are still backward and not playing a role. Among these Party members, some had a very low level of awareness when they joined the Party, and their awareness has not improved since joining the Party. Now they are unwilling to continue to fulfill their obligations as Party members and have no confidence in being a Communist Party member. For such people, they should be advised to withdraw from the Party during Party rectification. Some Party members were once active in their work, but have now lost their socialist enthusiasm. Some of them have become passive because their personal economic status has risen, and capitalist ideas have grown; others have been punished for making mistakes and have been removed from leadership positions, so they are unwilling to work actively for the Party. For these Party members, criticism and education should be carried out, their mistakes should be strictly pointed out, and they should be helped to correct their mistakes within a time limit in order to raise their socialist awareness and restore their revolutionary enthusiasm, and strive for them to meet the conditions for Party members within a certain period. If they still cannot correct their mistakes and actively work for the Party, they cannot be allowed to remain in the Party. Still others have various practical difficulties, such as some who are old and infirm or have been ill for a long time and cannot work; some women Party members have many children and are busy with housework and cannot do more work for the Party; and some have too low a work capacity and often fail to complete the tasks assigned by the Party. For these Party members, their practical difficulties should be taken into account, and they should be specifically assigned work that they can do so that they can regularly receive Party education and continuously improve their work ability in actual work so that they can do some work for the Party. As for the bad elements and degenerates who are found to have infiltrated the Party during Party rectification, they should be purged from the Party through certain procedures. The Party's rural grassroots organizations must work on the above-mentioned Party members according to their respective situations in the course of regular Party rectification, transform the existing passive and backward Party members, and eliminate the bad elements who have infiltrated the Party in order to purify and consolidate the Party's organization.

    In Party rectification, we should also pay attention to enriching Party life and improving the system of collective leadership of the branch. In rural areas, there are many grassroots organizations where only a few Party members are working for a long time, and the strength of the Party organization is not brought into play. There are also many grassroots organizations that are accustomed to holding "one-size-fits-all" meetings to replace the general meeting of all Party members, holding expanded meetings of township cadres to replace the branch committee, and using the general call of "Party members should take the lead" to replace the specific distribution of work to Party members. This habit restricts intra-Party democracy, restricts the enthusiasm of Party members, and destroys the principles of Party life. In the future, the tasks of the Party's grassroots organizations will be more arduous and the work will be more meticulous, requiring the wisdom of all branch committee members and all Party members to be concentrated, and the active role of each branch committee member and each Party member to be brought into play, in order to ensure that the cooperatives are run better. Therefore, through Party rectification, the Party's rural grassroots organizations are required to learn to hold regular general meetings of all Party members and branch committees, earnestly promote intra-Party democracy, and overcome the phenomenon of a few people monopolizing everything and making decisions individually.

    To ensure that the rural Party rectification work is carried out effectively and regularly, the Party organizations at all levels in rural areas must strengthen the regular and specific leadership over the Party rectification work. At present, some Party organizations understand the regular Party rectification work as only rectifying backward branches or only solving individual problems that occur within the Party, and do not regard the regular Party rectification work as a basic method of strengthening Party building and improving the Party's combat effectiveness in a planned way. Therefore, after collectivization, two incorrect understandings have arisen: one is that seeing that Party members have joined the cooperatives, they think that there are no more problems within the Party and that there is no need to carry out Party rectification work anymore. The other is that seeing that there are still problems within the Party after collectivization, they think that regular Party rectification cannot solve these problems, so they abandon regular Party rectification work and wait for a large-scale Party rectification in the future. Still other Party organizations have not guided the rural Party rectification work according to the new situation in rural areas and the new problems that have emerged in rural branches after collectivization, and still implement a generalized leadership over the Party rectification work. Therefore, the Party rectification work in these areas is divorced from the current reality and lacks practical content. All these ideas are important reasons for the current state of Party rectification work in some areas being in a state of self-flow or unable to produce the due effect, and should be corrected in actual work.

    In the future, Party organizations at all levels in rural areas, especially the county committees, should specifically help the Party's grassroots organizations to study the existing problems within the Party, make specific plans for carrying out Party rectification work in conjunction with the central tasks such as upgrading cooperatives, merging cooperatives, formulating production plans, and carrying out production competitions, and regularly check the implementation of the plans, discover problems, and solve problems. In this way, we can plan to enhance the positive role of Party members in the cooperatives and strengthen the Party's grassroots organizations' leadership over the cooperatives.

### 提高党员在农业合作社中的积极作用

    提高党员在农业合作社中的积极作用
    半年来，很多农村的党的基层组织，结合建社整社工作进行了建党整党，逐渐学会了在各项经常工作中不断地提高党员的积极作用，不断地克服党员中的消极落后的现象。党员参加了合作社，随着个人小农经济地位的变化，个人的利益和社的集体利益更趋一致，经过集体经营和集体劳动的锻炼，集体主义的思想就有了增强的可能。合作社逐渐实行多种经营，也给了党员在社内进行活动、发挥党员积极作用更好的条件。同时，由于合作社办得好坏，和广大社员的生活有密切的关系，因此广大社员要求党的基层组织领导大家办好合作社，要求党员发挥积极作用，这样社员群众对党的监督就更加加强了。所有这些，都给提高党员在合作社内的积极作用以有利条件。但是要使这些有利条件发生作用，还必须在党内进行很多思想工作和组织工作。
    在今后整党工作中，应当继续对党员进行社会主义教育，提高党员的社会主义觉悟。过去结合建社整社进行整党工作的时候，主要是集中地批判某些党员的资本主义思想和剥削行为。经过批判之后，少数有资本主义剥削行为的党员放弃了剥削；没有入社的党员，绝大多数参加了合作社，这说明过去的工作是有成绩的。目前的情况是：有些党员入社以后，特别是在他们担任了合作社的领导职务以后，以资本主义的经营管理方法来管理合作社，不服从国家生产计划，不履行预购合同；有些党员担任了农业社领导职务以后，不能正确贯彻勤俭办社的方针，铺张浪费，追求排场，而不关心贫苦社员的疾苦，不愿意听取社员意见，引起了社员群众的顾虑和不满；有些党员以管理小农经济的方法来管理合作社，不能充分运用合作经济的优越条件制定先进的生产计划，不肯研究采用新的生产技术和先进的经营管理方法。此外，较为普遍的现象是党员在社内的自私自利个人主义思想行为，只图个人多得工分，不顾生产质量，损坏公共财物等等，这都直接损害了社员群众的利益。这些有资本主义的经营管理思想、保守落后思想以及损人利己的个人主义思想的党员，虽然在一个基层组织中还是少数，但却直接削弱了党对合作社的领导。因此，在今后的整党工作中，必须组织和依靠党内积极的力量，不断地对这些思想和行为进行批判，教育党员掌握批评和自我批评的武器，随时在党内开展思想批判，解决这些党员的思想问题。
    对落后的党员加强思想教育工作，也是今后整党内容之一。经过半年多来的合作化运动，原来工作积极的党员更积极了，原来落后不能起应有作用的党员，大部分积极起来了。但是，还有一部分党员仍然表现得落后，不起作用。在这些党员中，有一部分党员入党的时候觉悟程度就很低，入党以后觉悟也没有提高，现在本人已不愿意继续履行党员义务，没有信心再做一个共产党员。对于这样的人，应该在整党中劝告他们退党。有一部分党员曾经积极工作过，现在丧失了社会主义积极性。这里边有的是因为个人经济地位上升，滋长了资本主义思想，消极起来了；有的是因为犯过错误，受过处分，被解除了领导职务，因而不愿意为党积极工作。对于这些党员，应该进行批评教育，严格地指出他们的错误，并且限期帮助他们改正错误，以提高他们的社会主义觉悟和恢复他们的革命积极性，争取他们能够在一定时期内具备党员条件。如果他们仍不能改正错误、积极为党工作，就不能让他们继续留在党内。还有一部分党员则是因为有着各种各样的实际困难，如有的年老体衰或长期有病，不能工作；有的妇女党员孩子多、家务忙，不能为党做较多的工作；有的工作能力过低，经常完不成党交给的任务。对这些党员，应该照顾到他们的实际困难，具体分配他们力所能及的工作，使他们经常地能受到党的教育，并在实际工作中不断提高工作能力，以便为党做一定的工作。至于在整党中发现的混入党内的坏分子和蜕化变质分子，则应该经过一定手续把他们清洗出党。党的农村基层组织必须在经常整党工作中对上述这些党员分别情况进行工作，改造现有消极落后的党员，清除混入党内的坏分子，以纯洁和巩固党的组织。
    在整党中，还要注意充实党内生活，健全支部的集体领导制度。农村中有不少基层组织长期存在着只有少数党员进行工作，不发挥党组织力量的现象。还有不少基层组织习惯于召开“一揽子”会议来代替全体党员大会，召开乡干部扩大会来代替支部委员会，习惯于用“党员要带头”的一般号召来代替具体分配给党员工作。这种习惯限制了党内民主，限制了党员的积极性，破坏了党的生活原则。今后党的基层组织的任务更加繁重，工作更加细致，要求能集中全体支部委员和全体党员的智慧，发挥每一个支部委员和每一个党员的积极作用，才能保证把合作社办得更好。因此通过整党工作，要求党的农村基层组织都能学会定期召开全体党员大会、支部委员会，切实发扬党内民主，克服少数人包办一切、个人决定问题的现象。
    要使农村整党工作有效地经常地进行，农村中的各级党的组织必须加强对整党工作的经常的具体领导。目前有些党的组织，把经常的整党工作理解为只是整顿落后支部或只解决党内发生的个别问题，没有把经常整党工作当成有计划地加强党的建设、提高党的战斗力的基本方法，因而在合作化以后就产生了两种不正确的认识：一种是看到党员都入了社，就认为党内没有什么问题了，不必再进行整党工作了。另一种是看到合作化后，党内还有问题，就认为经常整党不能解决这些问题，因而放弃了经常的整党工作，等待将来再进行大规模的整党。还有些党的组织没有根据合作化以后农村中的新情况和农村支部中出现的新问题去指导农村整党工作，仍然对整党工作实行一般化的领导，因而这些地区的整党工作就脱离了当前的实际情况，缺乏实际的内容。所有这些思想，都是造成目前整党工作在某些地区处于自流状态或者不能产生应有效果的重要原因，都应该在实际工作中加以纠正。
    今后农村中各级党的组织，特别是县委，应该具体帮助党的基层组织研究党内存在的问题，作出今后结合升社、并社、制定生产计划、开展生产竞赛等各项中心工作进行整党工作的具体计划，并经常检查计划的执行情况，发现问题，解决问题。这样，才能有计划地提高党员在合作社中的积极作用，加强党的基层组织对合作社的领导。
