    Beijing Ancient Astronomical Instrument Exhibition Hall Opens
    The ancient observatory in Beijing's Dongcheng District, next to Jianguomen, a world-renowned site, has been opened to the public as an exhibition from May 1st.
    More than 670 years ago, the Yuan Dynasty established one of the world's oldest astronomical observatories here - the Sitian Bureau. The Ming Dynasty renamed it the Star Gazing Platform, and the Qing Dynasty renamed it the Astronomical Observatory. Now, the China Association for Science and Technology has turned it into the Beijing Ancient Astronomical Instrument Exhibition Hall.
    On display on this platform are eight huge and exquisite bronze astronomical instruments, all manufactured during the Qing Dynasty. These instruments also feature artistic sculptures such as dragons, making them aesthetically pleasing.
    The exhibits in this exhibition hall demonstrate that China was one of the earliest countries to develop astronomy.

　　北京古代天文仪器陈列馆开放
    北京东城建国门旁城垣上一座闻名世界的古代观象台从五月一日起公开展览。
    六百七十多年以前，元代在这里建立了世界上古天文台之一——司天台，明代把它改名为观星台，清代又改名为观象台。现在中华全国科学技术普及协会把它辟为北京古代天文仪器陈列馆。
    在这个台上展出的八件巨大精巧的铜铸天文仪器，都是清代制造的。这些仪器上还有游龙等艺术雕塑，外表很美观。
    这个陈列室的展览品，显示出中国是天文学发展得最早的国家之一。
