To the Editor:

	Upon entering the Happiness Orchard Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Yantai City, Shandong Province, I saw new wooden boxes, resembling small houses, placed in the open spaces of the orchard not far from the members' residences. It is said that these boxes are used to store firewood ash from the members' homes, costing more than twelve yuan each. The cooperative made a total of thirty-eight, spending over 481 yuan.

	Further along, I saw many bricklayers busily building a series of brick-wall and cement-tile-roofed houses. At first, I thought these were being built as housing for the cooperative members. After inquiring, I learned that they were pigsties. The cooperative plans to build forty-two such pigsties this year, with an originally estimated cost of one hundred yuan each. By late April, the pigsties were not yet fully built, but over eight thousand yuan had already been spent, amounting to more than 195 yuan per pigsty.

	Since its establishment in 1953, the Happiness Orchard Production Cooperative has achieved bumper harvests year after year. The living standards of the members have greatly improved, and the cooperative has accumulated a considerable amount of public funds. As a result, the leaders of the cooperative, especially the cooperative director Jiang Ming, have developed a sense of pride, complacency, and a tendency to show off. Especially after the cooperative was expanded and became an advanced cooperative in December 1955, they became even more "generous" in spending money in order to demonstrate the "superiority" of the Happiness Cooperative. In addition to building fancy pigsties and making ash boxes, they also spent nearly three hundred yuan to buy bronze drums, bugles, and colorful silk flags, spent 293 yuan to repair basketball hoops and buy basketballs... Since the establishment of the advanced cooperative, the non-productive expenditures of this 149-household cooperative have amounted to 1,476 yuan.

	The Yantai Municipal Committee and the Suburban District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party should also be held responsible for the extravagant and wasteful practices of the Happiness Cooperative. The purchase of bronze drums, bugles, and colored silk flags by the Happiness Cooperative was carried out under the instructions of the Suburban District Committee and with the approval of relevant departments of the Municipal Committee. Although the Suburban District Committee later realized the need to implement the principle of "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily," it failed to adopt firm and effective measures to educate the cooperative's leaders to correct their mistakes upon discovering the wasteful practices of building pigsties, etc.

	The Happiness Cooperative, and other cooperatives with similar wasteful practices, must promptly mobilize the members to discuss and examine the wasteful practices, formulate an annual financial expenditure plan and financial system, earnestly implement the principle of "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily," and run the cooperative both well and economically.

### 铺张浪费的幸福果园生产合作社

    铺张浪费的幸福果园生产合作社
    编辑同志：
    一走进山东烟台市郊区的幸福果园生产合作社，我就看见在离社员住宅不远的果园空地上，摆着一只只像小房子似的新木板箱。据说，这些箱子是用来装社员家里的柴火灰的，每个成本十二元多，全社一共做了三十八个，用去481元多。
    再往前走，我看见很多泥瓦工人正在忙着修建一片砖墙和水泥瓦顶的房子。我开始还以为这是修建社员住宅，经过打听才知道是在盖猪圈。这样的猪圈，社里今年计划修建四十二间，原订造价是每间一百元。到四月下旬，猪圈还没有完全造好，钱已经花去八千多元，每间合195元多。
    幸福果园生产合作社在1953年成立以后，连年得到丰收。社员的生活得到很大的改善，社里的公共积累也很多。因此，这个社连年都被评为山东省和烟台市的果品生产模范单位。于是，这个社的领导人员，特别是社主任姜明，就滋长了一种骄傲自满情绪和好讲排场的作风。特别是1955年12月这个社扩大建成高级社后，他们为了要显示幸福社的“优越性”，花钱就更加“大方”起来。除了盖漂亮的猪圈和做灰箱子以外，还花了将近三百元来买铜鼓、铜号和彩色绸旗，花293元钱来修篮球架子和买篮球……。从建立高级社以来，这个149户的社的非生产性开支就有1，476元。
    中共烟台市委和郊区区委对幸福社的铺张浪费的现象也应该负责任。因为幸福社买铜鼓、铜号和彩绸就是在郊区委的指示和市委有关部门的批准下进行的。以后郊区区委虽然认识到必须贯彻“勤俭办社”的原则，但是发现了幸福社修猪圈等的浪费现象却没有采取坚决、有效的办法来教育社的领导人改正错误。
    幸福社和有类似铺张浪费情况的社，必须迅速发动社员讨论检查浪费情况，制定全年的财务开支计划和财务制度，切实贯彻“勤俭办社”的方针，把社办得又好又省。　辛文彬
