Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 30th - Construction has begun in the Karamay oil exploration area in the Junggar Basin of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Recently, construction of over 60,000 square meters of housing has commenced in this area, and several hundred kilometers of telephone lines and roads are also under construction.

Currently, hundreds of trucks carrying timber, equipment, and water travel day and night across the Gobi Desert; more than three thousand housing construction workers, road workers, and telephone line installers are working intensely in temperatures of forty degrees Celsius. By August of this year, more than sixty staff dormitories, offices, and bathhouses will be completed in this once sparsely populated Gobi Desert.

From last winter to May of this year, the five exploratory wells drilled in Karamay have all yielded crude oil, and it has been confirmed as a promising large oil field. The Xinjiang Petroleum Company is concentrating its efforts to accelerate the drilling of this oil field. After the completion of the roads and telephone line projects currently under construction, a network of roads and telephone lines will be initially formed in the vast exploration area, connecting the road transportation and communication between the Karamay exploration area and the Dushanzi mining area. This will enable a large number of equipment and materials to be transported to the exploration area in a timely manner.

    克拉玛依石油探区
    开始建筑公路和房舍
    新华社乌鲁木齐30日电　新疆维吾尔自治区准噶尔盆地的克拉玛依石油探区开始建设。最近，这个地区有六万多平方公尺的房舍开始兴建，另有几百公里长的电话线路和公路也开始施工了。
    现在，这个地区每天有几百辆运送木料、器材和水的汽车，日夜在戈壁上来往；三千多名房屋建筑工人、公路工人和架设电话线的工人，在摄氏四十度的气温下紧张劳动。到今年八月，这个过去人迹罕见的戈壁上，就将有六十多幢职工宿舍、办公室和澡塘落成。
    从去年冬天到今年五月，在克拉玛依钻成的五口探井都喷出了原油，并且已经被证实是一个很有希望的大油田。新疆石油公司正在集中力量加速这个油田的钻探工作。目前正在修建的这些公路和电话线路工程完工以后，将在面积辽阔的探区初步形成一个公路和电话线路网，并且沟通了克拉玛依探区和独山子矿区的公路运输和通讯联络。使大批器材和物资及时运往探区。
