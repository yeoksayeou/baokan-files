In the first spring plowing after the basic realization of semi-socialist agricultural cooperation, Hunan farmers have already won their first victory. The entire province has now completed the transplanting of early rice. The seedlings are strong and lush, a pleasing green.

This year, Hunan Province's main measure to increase production is to expand the planting of double-cropping rice by more than 12 million mu. The early rice planting work has been carried out quickly and well, laying a solid foundation for this year's agricultural production increase.

As early as late February, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the meeting of prefectural committee secretaries, proposed to vigorously mobilize the masses and make the rectification and consolidation of agricultural producers' cooperatives the central task around spring plowing. At that time, the most important issue was to universally implement the system of fixed quotas and piece-rate wages within agricultural producers' cooperatives. In early March, starting with the provincial party committee secretaries and deputy secretaries, party committee secretaries at all levels went deep into one township and one cooperative to research and create experience in fixed quota contracting.

After the secretaries took action and provided in-depth leadership, each county created fixed quota contracting methods that conformed to local realities. The CPC Yuanjiang County Committee, due to the county committee's personal in-depth focus, created a simple and easy-to-implement fixed quota contracting experience, which powerfully broke the idea of some staff members being afraid of trouble. By mid-March, all 135 agricultural producers' cooperatives in the county had formulated plans for contracting for work, output, and costs. By promptly grasping and solving important links in the management of cooperatives, agricultural cooperatives were able to put into production in an orderly manner, which created favorable conditions for spring plowing, especially early rice planting.

According to the requirements of double-cropping rice production increase, early rice planting should be as early as possible in order to allow late rice to catch up with the season and increase yield. However, the biggest threat to advancing early rice planting is seed and seedling rot. In previous years, early rice seedling fields often suffered from seedling rot due to cold snaps. This year's planting work is being carried out on a large scale by cooperatives. If seedling rot were to occur, the losses would be greater than in the past. Therefore, from the provincial party committee to the county party committee to the party branch of the cooperative, in mid-March, they were all summarizing the experience of veteran farmers, carefully searching for ways to plant early without seedling rot.

From summarizing farmers' experiences and studying the laws of spring climate change over the years, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee affirmed one point: as long as technical guidance is strengthened, the planting work can be advanced by seven or eight days to ten days. Because there have been several cold snaps around the Qingming Festival in past years, seedling rot has occurred when rice seeds encountered cold snaps after germination and rooting. If the seedlings can take root and emerge from the water during the gap of the cold snap, they will not rot even if they encounter a cold snap. In fact, in the past, a few experienced farmers were able to plant early without seedling rot, mainly because they had mastered this law. On March 16, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee issued an emergency directive, requiring all localities to immediately prepare for seed soaking and advance planting. The Provincial Party Committee required party committees at all levels to treat seed soaking and seedling cultivation as the most urgent task during those ten days or so.

Due to the high importance and strengthened leadership of party committees in various localities, the preparatory work for seed soaking and seedling cultivation throughout the province was relatively adequate. Each county in the Changde Prefecture trained 1,000 to 5,000 technicians for cultivating double-cropping rice. New technologies for seed soaking and seedling cultivation have been widely promoted throughout the province. After March 20, when seed soaking was generally carried out in various localities, most cooperatives implemented saline water seed selection, made suitable seedling fields, and implemented uniform sparse sowing. Some cooperatives also used baking soda to soak seeds and used formalin for seed disinfection. There were also full preparations for tidying up seedling fields and rational fertilization. The seed soaking work of each cooperative was mostly carried out by experienced members and trained technicians.

Just as seed soaking was becoming widespread throughout the province, the weather changed. For more than ten consecutive days in late March, it was overcast and rainy, and the temperature was very low. This was a great threat to seed soaking and seedling cultivation. The provincial, prefectural, and county party committees all issued instructions to strengthen seed soaking and seedling cultivation. On March 27, the CPC Changsha County Committee transferred 60 cadres to form eight inspection groups, led by the county party committee secretary and the head of the rural work department respectively, to go to the countryside to inspect the seed soaking and seedling cultivation work. The inspection groups formed by various districts in Xiangxiang County discovered problems and solved them at any time. Under the specific leadership of party committees at all levels, many advanced experiences to ensure no seed rot and no seedling rot were discovered and promoted. Many cooperatives adopted low-temperature germination and rapid germination methods, and established a special person in charge to carefully take care of the seed germination situation, not allowing the seeds to be damaged. Yuanjiang County vigorously promoted the bamboo mat germination method. Using this method to germinate seeds resulted in strong shoots and thick roots, with strong cold resistance.

After such intense struggle, during the seed soaking period, basically no seed rot occurred in the province. On April 1st and 2nd, the weather cleared, and various localities seized the time to sow seeds. After sowing, the struggle to protect seedlings followed closely. On April 5, Dongshan Farm in Xiangxiang County received a strong wind forecast, and that afternoon mobilized more than 800 male and female farm members to build windbreak fences for 120 seedling fields within four hours. It also deployed more than 600 farm members to be responsible for irrigating and draining the seedling fields. The seedling protection struggle of the Miao members of the Molong First Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Guzhang County, Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Prefecture, was even more touching. After they sowed 800 jin of early rice seeds, the temperature dropped, and the members built six stoves on the side of the field, burning hot water to irrigate the fields and raise the temperature of the seedling fields. They also built windbreak equipment, finally ensuring normal seedling development. The members proudly said: We can make the sun come out on a cloudy day.

After more than a month of intensive labor, after successfully completing the early rice sowing and seedling protection work, the farmers of Hunan Province smoothly completed the early rice transplanting work.

    第一个胜仗
    本报记者　高长任
    在基本上实现半社会主义农业合作化以后的第一次春耕中，湖南农民已经打了第一个胜仗。现在全省已经完成早稻插秧。禾苗壮旺，葱绿悦人。
    今年湖南省的主要增产措施是要扩种一千二百多万亩双季稻，早稻播种工作进行的又快又好，为今年农业增产打下了牢固的基础。
    早在二月下旬，中共湖南省委在地委书记联席会上就提出了大力发动群众，围绕春耕生产，整顿、巩固农业生产合作社为当前的中心工作。当时最主要的问题是要在农业生产合作社内普遍推行定额包工和按件计酬制度。三月初，从省委书记、副书记开始，各级党委书记都深入到一个乡、一个社，研究、创造定额包工的经验。
    在书记动手、深入领导以后，每个县都创造了符合当地实际情况的定额包工的办法。中共沅江县委由于县委亲自深入重点，创造简便易行的定额包工的经验，有力地打破了一些工作人员怕麻烦的思想，到三月中旬，全县135个农业生产合作社，都制定了包工、包产、包成本的方案。由于及时抓住和解决合作社经营管理中的重要环节，使农业合作社有秩序地投入生产，就为春耕生产，特别是早稻播种，创造了有利条件。
    按照双季稻增产的要求，双季稻早稻播种要愈早愈好，才能使晚稻赶上季节，增加产量。但是提早早稻播种的最大威胁，是烂种烂秧。在往年，早稻秧田就常常因为遇到寒潮，发生烂秧现象。今年的播种工作是以合作社为单位大规模地进行的，万一发生烂秧，损失会比过去更大。因此，从省委到县委到合作社的党支部，三月中旬，都在总结老农的经验，慎重地寻找既可早播又不烂秧的办法。
    从总结农民经验和研究多年来春季气候变化的规律中，中共湖南省委和省人民委员会肯定了一条：只要加强技术指导，就可以把播种工作提早七八天到十来天进行。因为历年来在清明前后，都有几次寒潮，烂秧都是在稻种发芽下泥后就遇到寒潮的情况下发生的。如果能在寒潮的空隙中，使秧苗扎根出水，即使遇到寒潮，也就不会烂秧了。事实上，过去少数有经验的农民能提早播种又不致烂秧，主要是因为他们掌握了这个规律。在三月十六日，中共湖南省委和省人民委员会发出紧急指示，要求各地立即准备浸种，提早播种。省委要求各级党委在那十多天内，把浸种育秧工作当作最紧急的任务。
    由于各地党委高度重视和加强领导，全省浸种育秧的准备工作做得比较充分。常德专区每一个县都训练了一千名到五千名培育双季稻的技术员。全省各地普遍推广了浸种育秧的新技术。在三月二十日以后，各地普遍浸种的时候，大部合作社实行了盐水选种，做合式秧田并且实行均匀稀播，有一部分合作社还采用小苏打浸种和用伏尔马林进行种子消毒。在整理秧田、合理施肥上也都有充分的准备。各个合作社的浸种工作，绝大部分是由有经验的社员和受过训练的技术员负责进行的。
    就在全省普遍浸种的时候，天气变化了，三月下旬整整十多天阴雨连绵，气温很低。这对于浸种育秧是个很大威胁。省委、地委、县委这时都发出了加强浸种育秧的指示。中共长沙县委在三月二十七日抽调六十名干部组织八个检查组，由县委书记、农村工作部长分别率领下乡，检查浸种育秧工作。湘乡县各区组成的检查组，发现问题，随时解决。在各级党委的具体领导下，许多保证不烂种、不烂秧的先进经验被发掘和推广了。很多合作社都采用低温催芽和快速催芽法，并且建立专人负责制，细心照料种子发芽情况，不让种子损坏。沅江县大力推广了晒簟催芽法；采用这种方法催芽，谷种就可芽壮根粗，抗寒力强。
    经过这样紧张的斗争，在浸种期间，全省基本上没有发生烂种的现象，四月一、二日天气放晴，各地都抓紧时间播种。播种之后，紧接着又展开护秧的斗争。湘乡县东山农庄在四月五日接到大风预报，当天下午就动员八百多名男女庄员，在四小时内，搭好了一百二十处秧田的防风篱笆；并且调配六百多名庄员，负责秧田的灌水放水工作。湘西苗族自治州古丈县默隆第一农业生产合作社的苗族社员的护秧斗争更是感人。在他们播下八百斤早稻子以后，气温下降了，社员们就在田边打了六个灶，烧热水灌田，提高秧田温度。同时也搭了防风设备，终于保证了秧苗发育正常。社员们自豪地说：我们能在阴天做出太阳来。
    湖南农民在经过一个多月的紧张劳动，在胜利完成早稻播种护秧工作以后，又顺利地完成了早稻插秧工作。
