    Flying Over the "Roof of the World"
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Zong Zidu
    On the morning of the 26th, on the Tibetan Plateau, known as the "Roof of the World," a large, grass-green transport plane bathed in brilliant sunlight, swept past the morning clouds, flying rapidly from east to west.
    The pilots, navigators, communicators, mechanics, and every passenger in the cabin of this aircraft wore thick leather flying suits and dark blue oxygen masks. The altimeter indicated that the aircraft was flying at an altitude of 6,500 meters. Below the wings, intricately arranged, sharply protruding snow peaks looked as if they were about to brush the plane's wings. The heater in the cabin continuously emitted warmth, and the edges of the glass windows were covered with granular ice flowers.
    This large transport plane from the capital of the motherland, Beijing, had already flown thousands of kilometers over the motherland's land. It had flown over cities with towering chimneys, over many vast green fields and farmland. The blue, sparkling Qinghai Lake had long been left behind; the source of the Yellow River, with its floating patches of wet clouds and ochre-colored ground, flashed by under the wings; the winds and clouds of the Bayan Har Mountains had not been able to stop this eagle; flying over the source of the Yangtze River, the Tongtian River, was like crossing a winding, narrow yellow ribbon. Now, it continued to flap its powerful wings, flying towards the heart of the Tibetan Plateau—Lhasa.
    To be able to pilot and ride the first lead plane from Beijing to Lhasa, freely flying over the "Roof of the World," how could one not be exceptionally excited! Although the airflow over the plateau at this time was violently impacting the fuselage and wings like a tide, and the propeller was making a huge roar, people still couldn't help but lift their oxygen masks and bring their mouths close to each other's ears to speak loudly. Some gestured to each other, wrote notes, and passed on their joyous feelings; others pressed their faces tightly against the glass windows, greedily admiring the magnificent scenery of the plateau.
    At this time, the morning mist gradually dissipated, and bright sunlight shone in through the glass window on the right side of the cabin. The majestic appearance of the Tibetan Plateau was clearly displayed before our eyes. Below the wings, countless glittering silver peaks and snowfields, glaciers, protruded above the drifting sea of clouds. On the edges of many snow-capped mountains, herds of black yaks moved. In the high-altitude cold regions, over 4,000 meters above sea level, green crops were growing. The day before yesterday, it had rained and snowed here, and the sunlight shining through the water vapor rising from the ground filled the sky with beautiful colors.
    Before there was time to carefully admire the scenery of the plateau, the plane had already flown over the Tanggula Mountain area. Here, due to the strong solar heat radiation and the turbulent airflow caused by the rugged mountains, the airflow was very unstable, and the amount of cloud cover changed two or three times in an hour. As one meteorologist said, the weather was peculiar, and there was no record of it in previous books. Flying over the Tanggula Mountain area was a dangerous pass on the Beijing-Lhasa air route. The pilot pulled the control stick, and the plane rose. The navigator accurately corrected the route according to the repeatedly revised flight map, and bravely advanced towards this dangerous pass.
    The expected difficulties appeared. High-altitude winds with a speed of thirty to forty meters per second and turbulent vertical airflow buffeted the plane up and down, and the actual flight speed was significantly reduced. The pilot held the steering wheel tightly with both hands, forcefully maintaining the balance of the plane, and finally, passed through the Tanggula Mountain area, and smoothly advanced towards Lhasa. The plane entered the vast Northern Tibetan grassland, where there were no more startling dangerous mountains and deep valleys. Looking out from the wide glass window of the cockpit, the undulating grassland stretched to the distant horizon. Hundreds of thousands of yaks grazed on the grassland. Beside the lakes and streams, the herders' tents were arranged.
    This smooth flight over the Northern Tibetan grassland did not last long. The further south the plane flew, the higher the terrain became. More than ten minutes later, the line of sight was blocked again by the rising peaks of the Nyainqêntanglha Mountains. The plane rocked its wings and drilled into the narrow mountain valley. The snow-capped mountains on both sides of the route, some as high as 7,300 meters, stood proudly, overlooking the back of the plane. Dark clouds floated on the route, and every member of the crew calmly performed their duties. When the plane safely passed through the Nyainqêntanglha Pass, not far ahead, the open grassland surrounded by mountain peaks was the airport near Lhasa.

    飞行在“世界屋脊”上
    新华社记者　宗子度
    二十六日早晨，在号称“世界屋脊”的西藏高原上空，一架草绿色的大型运输飞机沐浴着灿烂的阳光，掠过朵朵朝霞，从东向西迅速地飞行着。
    操纵这架飞机的飞行员，领航员，通讯员，机械员和坐舱里的每一位乘客，都穿着厚厚的皮飞行衣，戴着深蓝色氧气面罩。高度表的指针，指出飞机是在六千五百公尺的高空中飞行。机翼下面错综环列、尖锐突起的雪峰，看起来就像要擦着飞机的翅膀，坐舱里的加温炉不断地散发出暖气，玻璃窗的边缘结满了粒粒冰花。
    这架来自祖国首都——北京的大型运输飞机，在这以前已经在祖国的土地上飞行了好几千公里。它飞过了烟囱林立的城市，飞过了许多广阔的绿色原野和农田。闪耀着蓝色波光的青海湖，早已被丢到飞机的后面；浮动着片片湿云、地面呈土黄色的黄河发源地，转眼之间就从机翼下面掠过；巴颜喀拉山的风云，没有能阻挡住这架雄鹰；飞越长江源流——通天河，只像是跨过了一条蜿蜒狭窄的黄色带子。现在，它正继续鼓动着刚劲的翅膀，飞向西藏高原的心脏——拉萨。
    能够驾驶和乘坐第一架从北京通航拉萨的领队机，自由地飞行在“世界屋脊”上，怎能叫人不格外的激动和兴奋呢！尽管这时候高原上空的气流，像潮水一样猛烈地冲击着机身和机翼，螺旋桨发出巨大轰鸣，但人们仍禁不住掀开氧气面罩把嘴巴凑到对方的耳朵上大声说话。有的互打手势，写纸条，互相传告欢愉的心情；有的人把脸孔紧紧地贴到玻璃窗上，贪婪地欣赏着高原壮丽的景色。
    这时候，晓雾逐渐散开，从坐舱右边的玻璃窗里透射进来明亮的阳光。西藏高原雄伟的面貌清晰地展现在眼前。机翼下面，无数晶莹耀眼的银色山峰和雪田、冰川凸露在漂荡不定的云海之上。许多雪山边缘，移动着黑色的牦牛群。海拔四千多公尺的高寒地带，生长着绿色的农作物。在前天晚上，这里下过雨雪，阳光透过从地面上升起来的水蒸气，天空中布满了美丽的色彩。
    来不及仔细欣赏高原的风光，飞机已飞到了唐古拉山区上空。这里由于受太阳热辐射强烈和崎岖山岭扰动的气流的影响，气流很不稳定，云量在一个小时里就变化两、三次之多。正如一个气象工作人员所说的，天气是奇特的，在已往的书籍上也没有记载过。飞越唐古拉山区是北京—拉萨航空线上的一道险关。飞行员一拉操纵杆，飞机抬头上升。领航员根据多次校订过的飞行地图，准确地校正了航线，向着这道险关猛勇前进。
    预料中的困难出现了。每秒三四十公尺速率的高空风和汹涌的垂直气流，把飞机吹得上下颠簸，实际的飞行速度显著减低。飞行员两手紧紧地压在驾驶盘上，用力地保持着飞机的平衡，终于，穿过了唐古拉山区，顺利向拉萨前进。飞机进入了辽阔的藏北草原，这里再也没有触目惊心的险山深谷了。从驾驶室广阔的玻璃窗望出去，起伏的草原伸展到远远的天边。草原上放牧着成千上百的牦牛。湖泊和溪流的旁边，排列着牧民们的帐幕。
    在藏北草原上空这样平稳地飞行，并没有持续多久，飞机越往南飞，地形越加高耸，十多分钟后视线又被念青唐古拉山脉中崛起的山峰挡住了。飞机摇摇机翼，钻进了狭长的山谷里。航线两侧的雪山，有的高达七千三百多公尺，傲岸地耸立着，俯瞰着飞机的脊背。航线上又浮游着暗淡的乌云，机组里的每一个成员，都沉着地执行自己的工作任务。当飞机安全通过念青唐古拉山口时，前面不远，山峰环绕下的开阔草原，就是拉萨附近的机场了。
