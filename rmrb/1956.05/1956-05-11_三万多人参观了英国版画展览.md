The "British Print Exhibition," which left a good impression on the capital's audience, closed on the 10th. More than 30,000 people visited.

The exhibition of British prints in Beijing allowed a broad audience to gain a general understanding of the various British prints from the fifteenth, sixteenth centuries to the recent four hundred years, and provided valuable reference materials for Chinese artists engaged in printmaking, from which they drew useful experience.

This exhibition will also be held in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuhan, Chongqing, Guangzhou, and Xi'an.

    三万多人参观了英国版画展览
    给首都观众留下良好印象的“英国版画展览”，十日闭幕。观众共有三万多人。
    这次英国版画展览在北京的展出，使广大观众对十五、十六世纪到最近这四百多年来英国的各种版画有了概括的了解，并为从事版画创作的中国艺术家们提供了宝贵的参考资料，他们从中汲取了有益的经验。
    这个展览会还要在上海、杭州、武汉、重庆、广州和西安等地展出。
