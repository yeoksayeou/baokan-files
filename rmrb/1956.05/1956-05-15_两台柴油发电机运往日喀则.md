Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, May 14th. Two diesel generators manufactured by the state-owned Jinan Diesel Engine Factory for Xigaze, Tibet, have recently been produced and shipped to Tibet.

The technical requirement for these two diesel generators is that they must be able to operate safely and generate electricity on the Tibetan Plateau, which is three thousand seven hundred meters above sea level. Because the air is thin on the Tibetan Plateau, with only about 0.6 atmospheres of pressure (compared to about 1 atmosphere on the average plain), ordinary diesel engines cannot produce the required horsepower due to the low air intake.

The factory's engineers, technicians, and workers actively participated in the trial production to ensure that our fraternal nationalities could have bright lights as soon as possible. They studied adding supercharging equipment to the diesel generators. After many low-pressure tests, they finally succeeded in a low-pressure test using a high-altitude receiver. The factory has also specially dispatched two technicians and workers to Tibet to carry out the installation work.

    两台柴油发电机运往日喀则
    据新华社济南14日电　国营济南柴油机厂为西藏日喀则制造的两台柴油发电机，在最近出厂向西藏启运。
    这两台柴油发电机的技术要求是：必须在拔海三千七百公尺的西藏高原能够安全运转发电。因为，西藏高原空气稀薄，只有零点六个大气压左右（一般平原为一个大气压左右），一般柴油机因空气进量少，不能发出应有的马力。
    这个厂的工程技术人员和工人，为了使兄弟民族早日点上明亮的电灯，都积极参加了试制工作。他们研究在柴油发电机上添置了增压设备。经过许多次低压试验，最后终于利用高空接受器试验低压成功。这个厂还专门派了两名技术人员和工人到西藏去进行安装工作。
