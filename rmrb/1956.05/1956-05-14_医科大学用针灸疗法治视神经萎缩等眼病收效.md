Doctors from the Ophthalmology Teaching and Research Group of the Medical Department of the China Medical University have recently achieved preliminary results in treating patients with various optic atrophy, pseudo-myopia, and other conditions using acupuncture on the trigeminal nerve endings. This has solved problems that could not be addressed with general acupuncture in ophthalmology in the past. Li Shufang, a veteran, injured his eye three years ago and developed cataracts. Although he underwent surgery at the Medical University, his eyesight soon deteriorated and he became blind. Recently, after an examination by Associate Professor Xia Dezhao of the Ophthalmology Teaching and Research Group, it was confirmed that he had optic atrophy. After acupuncture treatment, the patient could immediately see fingers clearly at a distance of 30 cm. Currently, the patient is able to walk freely. Yu Jinghuan, a student at the Northeast Institute of Technology, suddenly lost his sight in late February this year. Lecturer Sun Shiwei of the Ophthalmology Teaching and Research Group examined him and confirmed that he had "optic nerve chiasm arachnoiditis." He was treated with antibiotics for more than twenty days, and although the patient's vision recovered slightly, progress was not significant. Recently, they used this acupuncture method for one treatment, and on the third day after the treatment, the patient's vision began to improve significantly. After more than twenty days of treatment, both eyes completely returned to normal. (Shenyang Daily Editorial Department)

    医科大学用针灸疗法治视神经萎缩等眼病收效
    中国医科大学医疗系眼科教研组的医生，最近采用对三叉神经末梢进行针灸疗法，医治各种视神经萎缩、假性近视等患者初步见效，解决了过去在眼科医疗上，用一般针灸所不能解决的问题。复员军人李树芳，三年前眼睛受伤长了白内障，虽经医科大学进行手术治疗，但不久眼力仍旧失明。最近经该校眼科教研组夏德昭副教授检查证明是视神经萎缩，采取针灸治疗后，患者当时就可清楚地在三十糎处看到手指，目前患者已能自由行走。东北工学院学生于景寰，今年二月下旬眼睛忽然失明，经眼科教研组孙世维讲师检查，证明是“视神经交叉蜘蛛膜炎”，曾用抗生素治疗了二十多天，虽然患者的视力稍有恢复，可是进展不大。最近他们采用这种针灸疗法进行了一次治疗，治后第三天，患者的视力开始显著增进，接着经过二十多天的治疗两眼完全恢复了正常。　（沈阳日报编辑部）
