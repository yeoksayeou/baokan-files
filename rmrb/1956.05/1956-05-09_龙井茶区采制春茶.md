　　Longjing Tea Area Harvesting and Processing Spring Tea

    The spring tea harvesting and processing season in China's famous Longjing tea area has entered its peak. From West Lake to the banks of the Qiantang River, thousands of tea-picking girls are working diligently on the green tea mountains every day.
    The Longjing tea area consists of four townships in the West Lake District of Hangzhou: Yunqi, Longjing, Maojiabu, and Jinshagang. It has more than 3,700 acres of tea gardens, with an annual output of 580,000 jin of Longjing tea. The output in 1955 increased by more than 50% compared to the early post-liberation period, and this year's production plan is to increase by another 39% compared to last year. To strengthen production management of tea gardens and technical guidance for harvesting and processing, the four townships in the Longjing tea area have been merged into one Longjing township this year. Currently, the township has one state-owned Longjing Tea Farm, twelve advanced agricultural production cooperatives, including ten tea production cooperatives. The number of farm households joining the cooperatives accounts for 99.5% of the total number of households in the township.
    After collectivization, the Longjing tea area has seen a surge in production. Labor competitions to improve tea yield and quality are being widely carried out between cooperatives, teams, and groups. The tea area, with the technology promotion station as the center, has organized a technology promotion network and trained more than 200 farmer technicians. After the autumn tea harvest last year, the tea cooperatives carried out winter plowing, soil cultivation, weeding, pest control, fertilization, and pruning in the tea gardens. This has ensured this year's tea production increase. For example, in the 160 acres of tea gardens on the northern slopes of Lion Peak and Five Cloud Mountain, which often suffered from frost damage and reduced production in previous years, winter plowing, soil cultivation, covering with straw for warmth, and burning smoke piles to drive away frost were carried out last year. Now the spring tea is growing very lushly, and it is expected that this year's spring tea production will increase by 30% compared to the same period last year. This year, female cooperative members have promoted advanced tea-picking techniques such as "leaving leaves while picking" and "picking with both hands, lifting hands to pick" during the spring tea harvest, increasing labor efficiency by a factor of one and ensuring quality.
    The tea production cooperatives in the Longjing tea area have 29 tea frying workshops, 1,629 tea frying stoves, as well as 35 tea leaf fixing machines and kneading machines. During the busy spring tea season, newly installed electric lights shine brightly all night long, and cooperative members are making tea day and night. The Shiyue (October) Tea Production Cooperative in Meijiawu also promoted the "assembly line operation method" in tea frying, assigning each cooperative member to operate according to their technical specialties, respectively in charge of stir-frying green leaves, stir-frying second green, stir-frying in a glossy wok, sifting tea, and stoking the fire. This increased tea frying efficiency from an average of three jin per person per day in the past to four jin. When the spring tea started to be harvested, the quality of more than 80% of the tea reached the highest grade.
    The two tea purchasing stations located in the Longjing tea area guarantee the price of tea and eliminate the trouble of sales. Now the purchasing stations purchase tens of thousands of jin of fresh Longjing spring tea every day, and these teas have been successively transported to Hangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and other places to supply the general public.

　　龙井茶区采制春茶
    屠正峰
    我国著名的龙井茶区春茶采制已进入旺季。从西子湖到钱塘江畔，一片绿色的茶山上每天有上千个采茶姑娘在紧张地采摘春茶。
    龙井茶区，是由杭州市西湖区的云栖、龙井、茅家埠、金沙港四个乡组成。有三千七百多亩茶园，龙井茶的年产量有五十八万斤，1955年的产量比解放初期提高50％以上，今年产量计划比去年再提高39％。为了加强对茶园生产管理和采制的技术指导，今年龙井茶区的四个乡并成一个龙井乡。现在全乡有一个地方国营龙井茶场；有十二个高级农业生产合作社，其中有十个茶叶生产合作社。入社农户占全乡总户数的99.5％。
    合作化后的龙井茶区掀起了生产高潮。社与社、队与队、组与组广泛地开展了提高茶叶产量和质量的劳动竞赛。茶区以技术推广站为中心，组织了一个技术推广网，训练了二百多农民技术员。茶叶社去年秋茶采摘后，就进行了茶园冬耕、培土、削草、治虫、施肥、修剪等工作。这样保证了今年茶叶增产。如狮子峰、五云山等山北面的一百六十亩茶园，往年常因受冻减产，去年进行冬耕培土、盖稻草保暖、烧烟堆赶霜等措施，现在春茶长得很茂盛，预计今年春茶要比去年同期增产30％。今年女社员在春茶采摘中推广了“留叶采”、“双手采、提手采”等先进采茶技术，使劳动效率提高一倍，而且保证了质量。
    龙井茶区的茶叶生产合作社有二十九个炒茶工场，一千六百二十九只炒茶灶，还有三十五架茶叶杀青机和揉捻机。紧张的春茶季节，新装的电灯通宵放明，社员们夜以继日地制茶。梅家坞十月茶叶生产合作社在炒茶中还推行了“流水作业法”，按照每个社员的技术特长，分别给他们担任炒青叶、炒二青、炒辉锅、筛茶、烧火等操作，这样炒茶效率由过去每人每日平均炒三斤提高到四斤；春茶开始采摘时茶叶的质量80％以上都达到了特级。
    设在龙井茶区的两个茶叶收购站，保证了茶叶的价格，而且免除了销售的麻烦。现在收购站每天要收购上万斤新鲜的龙井春茶，这些茶叶已陆续运往杭州、上海、北京、内蒙古、新疆等地供应广大人民。（附图片）
