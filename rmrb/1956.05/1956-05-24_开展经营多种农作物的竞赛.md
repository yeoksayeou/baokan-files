The agricultural production cooperatives in Wangcheng Township, Xishui County, Hubei Province, have promoted the improvement of production quality through competition. In the recent evaluation in this township to check the growth of seedlings, a pioneer cooperative was found to have weeds in its paddy fields. They immediately used fire tongs to remove the weeds, ensuring that the paddy fields were weed-free. The competition also stimulated the creativity of the masses. For example, the sugarcane planted by the "July 1st" cooperative was traditionally "transplanted," but this year it was changed to "direct seeding," which not only saves labor but also ensures the robust growth of the sugarcane. Now, in order to fully develop the competition, the township has launched competitions with various content, based on the operational characteristics of each agricultural production cooperative, including rice, cotton, high-yield crops, cattle raising, pig raising, fish farming, and orchard management.

    开展经营多种农作物的竞赛
    湖北省浠水县望城乡的农业生产合作社通过竞赛运动促进了生产质量的提高。这个乡在最近一次评比中检查秧苗长得好不好，有一个先锋社被检查出秧田有草，他们立即用火钳把秧田的草拔掉，作到秧田无草。通过竞赛运动也发挥了群众的创造性。如“七一”社种的甘蔗，历年是“移栽”，今年改为“直播”，不仅省工，而且可以保证甘蔗生长茁壮。现在这个乡为使竞赛运动全面开展，已根据各个农业生产合作社的经营特点，开展了水稻、棉花、高产作物、养牛、养猪、养鱼、经营果园等多种内容的竞赛。
