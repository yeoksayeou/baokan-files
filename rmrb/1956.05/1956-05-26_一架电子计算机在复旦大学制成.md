An Electronic Computer is Made at Fudan University

    This newspaper Shanghai 25th dispatch: China's first self-made electronic computer gave a demonstration at 7:30 pm today in the Physics Department of Fudan University. After preliminary trial calculations, its performance was good.

    This electronic computer was designed and installed by Lai Zu, a young lecturer in the Electronics Laboratory of the Physics Department of Fudan University, He Yuliao, assistant Yuan Ju, technician Zheng Zhi, and Yao Jin, a fourth-year student in the Mathematics Department, and named the "Fudan 601 Electronic Integrator." It can solve fourth-order constant coefficient differential equations.

    The manufacturing work of this electronic computer started in March this year. When these young scientific workers started their work, they didn't even have a ready-made circuit design drawing. They studied the design principles of Soviet electronic computers and, after more than two months, finally successfully trial-produced China's first electronic computer.

    一架电子计算机在复旦大学制成
    本报上海25日电　我国自制的第一架电子计算机，今天下午七时半在上海复旦大学物理系作了一次表演，经过初步试算，性能良好。
    这架电子计算机是复旦大学物理系电子学实验室的青年讲师赖祖、何育辽，助教袁榘，技术员郑志，数学系四年级学生姚晋等五人设计和安装的，定名为“复旦六零一型电子积分机”。它能解四阶常系数微分方程组。
    这架电子计算机的制造工作是从今年三月开始的，这些年轻的科学工作人员在开始工作的时候，连一张现成的电路设计图纸都没有，他们就根据苏联电子计算机的设计原理加以钻研，经过两个多月，终于试制成功了我国第一架电子计算机。
