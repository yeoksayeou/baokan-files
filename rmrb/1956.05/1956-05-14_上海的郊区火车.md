Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 13th—The factory districts, school districts, and the three major parks of Hongkou, Zhongshan, and the West Suburbs in the western and northern suburbs of Shanghai are now connected by railway lines.

The holiday park train has already been opened from Shanghai North Railway Station to the West Suburbs Park. The Songhu line from North Station to Yunzaobang in the northern suburbs, which is connected to this line, originally had five trains a day, and has added five more trains since the 11th, making it more convenient for workers to go to work.

Today is Sunday, and the weather in Shanghai is mild and sunny. Many people who have worked for a week are taking their families to the suburbs by train. On the North Station - West Suburbs Park line, more than 400 workers and students took the park train this morning to enjoy their holiday. The trains on the Songhu line depart every hour or so, and each train is full of happy passengers.

    上海的郊区火车
    新华社上海13日电　上海西郊、北郊的工厂区、学校区以及虹口、中山和西郊三个大公园，现在已经由铁路线沟通了。
    从上海北火车站到西郊公园间已经开放了假日游园列车。跟这条线相接的北站到北郊蕴藻浜的淞沪线，原来每天开五班车，十一日起又增开五班，工人上班更加方便了。
    今天是星期天，上海风和日暖，许多劳动了一周的人们带着自己的家属乘火车去郊游。北站—西郊公园线上，今天早晨有四百多个工人、学生乘游园列车去欢度假日。淞沪线的火车，每隔一小时多开出一班，班班都乘满了愉快的旅客。
