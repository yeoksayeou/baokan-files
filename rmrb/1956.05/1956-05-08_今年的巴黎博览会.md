　　This Year's Paris Exposition
    Yao Yun
    Spring has arrived in Paris. The chestnut trees along the Champs-Élysées and near the Louvre are already lush with green leaves. In the dazzling spring sunshine, advertisements with a ship-shaped logo posted at various intersections remind Parisians: it's time for the Paris Exposition to open again.

    Paris is a city with a tradition of holding expositions. The Eiffel Tower, now a famous landmark of Paris, was built for an exposition held in 1889. Since 1904, except during the two world wars, Paris has held an exposition every spring to showcase the latest and best products created by the working people, and the business community also seeks opportunities to expand their business at the exposition. In recent years, the desire for peaceful trade has made the exposition more lively year by year. This year's Paris Exposition has the participation of 13,000 exhibitors from twenty-seven countries, the highest record in fifty years.

    This year's Paris Exposition is particularly attractive to French and foreign visitors because two new countries are participating in the exhibition: New China and Romania. Last year, the Chinese Peking Opera troupe caused a sensation in Paris; this year, Parisians will see the economic, cultural, and social life of New China from the Chinese pavilion with its red walls and green tiles.

    For many Westerners, China is a distant and mysterious country. China participated in a grand Paris International Exposition held in 1900. At that time, other countries exhibited machines and automobiles, while the so-called "machines" exhibited by China were only a model of a jade cutting machine, as well as sampans and ox carts. Since then, endless river water has flowed under the bridges of the Seine, and the ancient China has undergone earth-shaking changes. New China has come a long way in the short six or seven years since its founding. Today, in the Chinese pavilion at the Paris Exposition, people can already see that, in addition to Chinese handicrafts that have always been world-renowned, there are also various high-precision machines and instruments made in China, as well as models of China's First Automobile Manufacturing Plant and modern seamless steel tube plant equipped with the latest machines. This is a specimen of New China advancing on the road of socialist industrialization.

    When French business people see the various traditional export goods displayed in the Chinese pavilion, they naturally think about the future of trade between China and France. Three hundred years ago, in 1660, the first French merchant ship arrived in Guangzhou, and commercial relations between China and France were established. Between 1924 and 1929, the trade volume between the two countries reached a peak of 80 to 110 million US dollars. Today, China, with a population of 600 million, an area almost equal to that of Europe, and abundant resources, is carrying out large-scale economic construction, and its trade potential is even greater. Therefore, since the arrival of the Chinese exhibition delegation in Paris, many French and foreign business people have contacted the Chinese exhibition delegation. It is not difficult to understand that they are eager to discuss trade issues with the Chinese side.

    However, it must also be noted that there are still artificial obstacles such as the "embargo" on the road of Sino-French trade. The "COCOM" (Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls), tasked with implementing the "embargo," is one of the most unpopular institutions in the city of Paris. The call for lifting the "embargo" and normalizing Sino-French trade relations is rising day by day in the business community. A French saying goes: "You can refuse everything, but you cannot refuse clear thinking." At present, the clear thinking that demands peaceful trade, just like the warm sunshine of spring that will inevitably replace the severe cold of winter and come to Paris, is irresistible.

    In the short few days since the arrival of the exhibition delegation in Paris, people can feel everywhere the feelings of the French people towards the Chinese people and New China. French youths and children wave to the members of the Chinese exhibition delegation in a friendly manner. French workers worked day and night to build the Chinese pavilion, even on Easter and weekly holidays, so that the Chinese pavilion became one of the first pavilions to be completed at the Paris Exposition. People sincerely hope that New China's first participation in the Paris Exposition will enhance friendship and understanding between the people of France and China, and promote the development of economic and trade relations between the two countries.

### 今年的巴黎博览会

　　今年的巴黎博览会
    姚云
    春天来到了巴黎。爱丽舍大街和卢夫宫一带的栗子树已经绿叶成荫了。在绚丽的春光中，张贴在各个十字路口的画着船形标志的广告画提醒巴黎人：又到了巴黎博览会开幕的时节了。
    巴黎是一个有举办博览会传统的城市。现在成为巴黎名胜的爱菲尔铁塔，就是为1889年举行的一次博览会而建造的。从1904年以来，除了两次大战期间，巴黎在每年春天都要举行博览会，来展出劳动人民所创造的最新、最好的东西，而工商界也在博览会上寻求扩大他们的业务的机会。近年来和平贸易的愿望促使博览会一年比一年热闹。今年的巴黎博览会有二十七个国家的一万三千个展出单位参加，这是五十年来的最高纪录。
    今年的巴黎博览会特别吸引法国和外国人士，因为有两个新的国家参加展出，这就是新中国和罗马尼亚。去年，中国的京剧团轰动了巴黎；今年，巴黎人将从红墙绿瓦的中国展览馆看到新中国的经济、文化和社会生活的面貌。
    对于不少西方人说来，中国是一个遥远的神秘的国家。在1900年举行的一次盛大的巴黎国际博览会上，中国曾经参加展出。那个时候，别的国家展出了机器和汽车，而中国展出的所谓“机器”却只有一部切玉机的模型以及舢板和牛车。自从那个时候以来，无尽的河水从塞纳河的桥下流过去了，古老的中国发生了翻天覆地的变化。新中国在成立以来的短短六七年中走了一长段的道路。今天，在巴黎博览会的中国馆里，人们已经可以看到，除了素来闻名世界的中国手工艺品以外，还有中国制造的精密度极高的各种机器和仪器以及用最新机器装备起来的中国第一汽车制造厂和现代化的无缝钢管厂的模型。这就是在社会主义工业化的道路上前进的新中国的标本。
    法国工商界人士在看到中国馆中陈列着的各种传统出口物资的时候，自然而然地想到中法之间的贸易前途问题。三百年前，也就是1660年，第一艘法国商船到达广州，中法两国之间的商务关系就建立起来了。在1924年到1929年之间，两国之间的贸易额曾经达到过八千万到一亿一千万美元的高峰。今天，拥有六亿人口、面积差不多和欧洲相等的物产富饶的中国进行着大规模的经济建设，它的贸易潜力就更大了。因此，自从中国展览团到达巴黎以来，已经有法国和外国的许多工商界人士同中国展览团进行了接触。他们迫切希望同中国方面商谈贸易问题，这是不难理解的。
    然而，也不能不看到在中法贸易的道路上仍然存在着像“禁运”这样的人为的障碍。以执行“禁运”为任务的“统筹委员会”是巴黎这个城市里最不受人欢迎的机构之一。工商界中要求解除“禁运”而使中法贸易关系正常化的呼声，正在一天比一天高涨。法国有句格言说：“可以拒绝一切，但是不能拒绝清醒的思想。”目前，要求和平贸易的清醒思想，就像春天和煦的阳光必定要代替冬天凛冽的寒潮来到巴黎一样，是不可抗拒的。
    在展览团人员到达巴黎的短短几天中，已经处处可以感觉到法国人民对中国人民，对新中国的感情。法国的青年和少年儿童们在看到中国展览团人员的时候就亲切地向他们招手。法国的工人们为了建筑中国展览馆，曾经夜以继日地进行工作，甚至在复活节和星期例假的日子里也不休息，终于使中国馆成为巴黎博览会里第一批完成的展览馆之一。人们都真诚希望；新中国第一次参加巴黎博览会的展出，会增进法、中两国人民之间的友谊和了解，促进两国经济贸易关系的发展。
