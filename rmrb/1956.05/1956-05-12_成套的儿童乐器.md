    Complete Set of Children's Musical Instruments

    The first batch of complete sets of children's musical instruments produced by the Beijing Musical Instrument Factory has been warmly welcomed by children. Nurseries and kindergartens in Jiangxi, Hunan, Sichuan and other places have even come from afar to purchase them.

    This set of children's musical instruments is designed and manufactured for children aged three to seven. It can provide a small orchestra composed of sixteen children to collectively play some simple tunes. It includes Chinese ancient musical instruments—xylophones and wooden clappers, tambourines popular among the Uygur people in Xinjiang, as well as Western musical instruments such as sand rattles, jingle sticks, and sound cylinders.

    Based on the opinions of childcare workers from various regions, the Beijing Musical Instrument Factory began systematically researching children's musical instruments at the beginning of last year, and successively consulted experts and professors at the Central Conservatory of Music and the East China Branch of the Central Conservatory of Music.

    Now, the factory has achieved preliminary results in the research of musical instruments suitable for children aged seven to fifteen, and is now preparing for trial production.

    成套的儿童乐器
    北京市乐器厂出产的第一批成套的儿童乐器，受到儿童的热烈欢迎。江西、湖南、四川等地的托儿所、幼儿园还远道前来采购。
    这种成套的儿童乐器，是给三岁到七岁儿童设计制造的。它可以供十六个儿童组成一个小乐队，集体弹奏一些简单的曲调。这里有中国的古乐器——木琴、木梆，盛行于新疆的维吾尔族中的铃鼓，以及西洋乐器中的沙球和板铃、响筒等。
    北京市乐器厂根据各地保育工作者的意见，在去年年初便开始对儿童乐器进行系统的研究，并且先后到中央音乐学院、中央音乐学院华东分院，征求了专家、教授的意见。
    现在，这个厂对适合于七岁到十五岁少年儿童使用的乐器的研究，已经取得了初步成果，现在正准备试制。
