Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 16th: The All-Union Conference on High-Energy Particle Physics opened on May 14th at the USSR Academy of Sciences in Moscow. Many prominent Soviet physicists are participating in the conference, as well as guests from more than sixty countries, including renowned scholars and professors from Britain, France, the United States, and China.

Corresponding Member of the USSR Academy of Sciences, M. G. Meshcheryakov, stated in his opening address that the purpose of this conference is to exchange experiences and achievements in a friendly atmosphere, jointly discuss new experimental situations, and point out the path and prospects for further research in high-energy particle physics and accelerator technology. Meshcheryakov emphasized that, in accordance with the spirit of the conference, these studies have a high degree of humanitarian purpose, which is to do everything possible to raise the level of human knowledge. Soviet scientists believe that achievements in this area are indisputably achievements for all mankind.

Professor Meshcheryakov said that the Soviet Union will soon put into operation an accelerator that can accelerate protons to 10 billion electron volts, and is also designing an accelerator that can accelerate protons to 50 billion electron volts. He said that the United States has already put into operation an accelerator that accelerates protons to about 6 billion electron volts, and is designing accelerators with greater energy.

The first report at the opening session was given by Corresponding Member of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Mintz. He reported on the manufacturing process and operation of a six-meter synchrocyclotron that can accelerate protons to 680 million electron volts. This is one of the two largest Soviet accelerators currently in use at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. He also discussed the problem of manufacturing new magnetic measuring instruments with high sensitivity.

The conference listened very attentively to the report by Corresponding Member of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Veksler, on the construction in the Soviet Union of a synchrophasotron that can accelerate protons to 10 billion electron volts. This accelerator will be used to study the properties of elementary particles and nuclear cascade reactions. It is currently the most efficient accelerator of its type.

Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Vladimirsky, reported on the main characteristics of a powerful proton accelerator currently being designed that can accelerate protons to 50 to 60 billion electron volts.

At the first meeting, Professor Marshall of the University of Chicago reported on the design of the proton synchrotron being built at the National Argonne Laboratory in the United States, which can accelerate protons to 15 billion electron volts.

The conference will last for a week, and 120 reports will be heard at the conference.

    全苏高能量粒子物理学会议开幕
    新华社16日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：全苏高能量粒子物理学会议五月十四日在莫斯科苏联科学院开幕。参加这次会议的有许多著名的苏联物理学家，还有六十多个国家的来宾，其中包括英国、法国、美国和中国的著名学者和教授。
    苏联科学院通讯院士麦谢里亚科夫在开幕词中说，这次会议是为了在友好的气氛中交流经验和成就，共同讨论新的试验情况，指出在高能量粒子物理学和加速器技术方面进一步研究的道路和前途。麦谢里亚科夫强调指出，根据会议的精神，这些研究具有高度的人道主义目的，这就是竭尽一切可能来提高人类知识的水平。苏联科学家认为在这方面的成就无可争辩地是全人类的成就。
    麦谢里亚科夫教授说，苏联在最近就将有使质子加速到一百亿电子伏特的加速器投入生产，并且还在设计把质子加速到五百亿电子伏特的加速器。他说，目前美国的把质子加速到约六十亿电子伏特的加速器已经投入生产，并且正在设计具有更大能量的加速器。
    在开幕会上第一个作报告的是苏联科学院通讯院士明次。他报告了一种可以把质子加速到六亿八千万电子伏特的六公尺同步回旋加速器的制造过程和工作情况。这是现在供给联合核子研究所使用的苏联两个最大的加速器当中的一个。他还讲述了制造具有高度敏感性的新型磁性测量仪器的问题。
    会议非常注意地听取了苏联科学院通讯院士维克斯勒尔所作的关于苏联正在建筑一个能把质子加速到一百亿电子伏特的同步稳相加速器的报告。这个加速器将用来研究基本粒子和核子级联作用的特性。它是目前同样类型加速器中效能最大的。
    物理数学博士弗拉吉米尔斯基报告了目前正在设计的能把质子加速到五百亿到六百亿电子伏特的强大质子加速器的主要特性。
    在第一次会议上，美国芝加哥大学教授马歇尔报告了在美国国立阿冈尼研究所里建造的能把质子加速到一百五十亿电子伏特的质子同步加速器的设计情形。
    会议将进行一周，在会议上将听取一百二十个报告。
