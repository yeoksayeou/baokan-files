The Birth of "Fu Yuan" (Recovery)
    Cheng Jiakai

    On the 16th day of the third month of the lunar calendar in 1955, a new life was born in the home of Wang Benbai in Fu'e Township, She County, Anhui Province.

    "Congratulations! Congratulations! It's a son," said the midwife.

    Wang Benbai was beaming with joy. He quickly dyed the eggs red, stuck a cypress branch on the wine pot, and hurried twenty-five li to his father-in-law's house to announce the good news.

    The people at the bride's home were extremely happy. "Bao Sanyue" had been married for nine years, and today they finally received this happy news. The next morning, the younger sister, Bao Xiuyue, brought eggs, brown sugar, and other gifts to Wang Benbai's house to congratulate them.

    According to local custom, on the third day, the elder great aunt, Wang Aiwen, came to name the child. She carefully examined the sleeping infant, then turned her gaze to the healthy mother, and said with a smile, "You two conceived this child after recovering your health. Let's name him 'Fu Yuan' (Recovery)."

    "That's right, if it weren't for the Communist Party curing our illnesses and restoring our health, we would have been long gone. How could we have this day?" said the mother, "Bao Sanyue."

    Indeed, the Communist Party saved the lives of "Bao Sanyue" and Wang Benbai, and also saved the lives of millions of others.

    Fu'e Township in She County is a severely schistosomiasis-stricken area. Before liberation, people had no way to deal with this disease. Countless people were deprived of their precious lives. After the Communist Party came, it launched a large-scale schistosomiasis prevention and treatment campaign, rescuing many people from the brink of death and teaching them how to eradicate schistosomiasis. In recent years, the People's Government has cured 564 schistosomiasis patients in Fu'e Township alone. "Bao Sanyue" and Wang Benbai are just two of them.

    In 1952, "Bao Sanyue" and Wang Benbai were already suffering from late-stage schistosomiasis. They were so thin that they were skin and bones, with no strength at all, and stayed at home all day, leaving their fields barren. The villagers sighed and said they wouldn't live long. That year, the couple planted 8.6 mu of land, taking turns. Wang Benbai mustered his strength to plow the field, and "Bao Sanyue" forced herself to plant the rice seedlings. After that, they had no strength to tend the crops and had to let the paddy fields go to waste. When the rice ripened, they hired someone to harvest it. The 8.6 mu of land yielded only 1,600 jin of rice, less than 200 jin per mu.

    In November 1952, the local People's Government sent Wang Benbai to the county schistosomiasis prevention and treatment hospital for free treatment. Because there were not enough beds, "Bao Sanyue" temporarily returned to her mother's home.

    In the first month of the following year, Wang Benbai returned from the county in high spirits after being cured. He hurried to pick up his wife, preparing to send her to the city for treatment. "Bao Sanyue" had become a skeleton, lacking even the strength to speak.

    In June 1953, "Bao Sanyue" also went to the county schistosomiasis prevention and treatment hospital for free treatment. "Bao Sanyue's" surname was not originally "Bao," but "Bao." Because she was too weak to withstand injections of antimony, she needed to rest in the hospital for a longer period. To ease her worries, the doctor comforted her by saying, "I guarantee you'll be cured in three months, don't worry." Therefore, after she was cured, she was called "Bao Sanyue" (Guarantee Three Months). In fact, "Bao Sanyue's" illness was not cured in three months. She rested in the hospital for nearly half a year and began receiving antimony injections on December 22nd, finally being discharged on January 26th of the following year—1954.

    After "Bao Sanyue" and Wang Benbai were cured of schistosomiasis, their enthusiasm for production greatly increased. They did all the work in the fields themselves. Last year, they still cultivated the same 8.6 mu of land, yielding 3,600 jin of rice, 2,000 jin more than in 1952.

    After the autumn harvest last year, they joined the Red Flag Agricultural Production Cooperative.

    On March 17th, I visited "Bao Sanyue's" home.

    "Bao Sanyue" is a young woman of medium height, not yet thirty years old. She has a plump, round face, wears a clean blue poplin jacket, and has two black braids hanging down her chest. "Fu Yuan" nestled in his mother's arms, his chubby little hands waving at me. Seeing her and her son so healthy, it was hard for me to believe that she had once been on the brink of death.

    On an earthen hill, I found Wang Benbai. He was swinging a hoe, preparing seedbeds for Victory No. 100 sweet potatoes. Wang Qiutang, the deputy director of the Red Flag Cooperative, told me: Wang Benbai is now one of the cooperative members who earns the most work points.

    I looked around. The rapeseed flowers of the cooperative were already golden, but many members were still busy in the fields.

    "The rapeseed flowers are blooming, what are they doing in the fields?" I asked.

    Wang Benbai said excitedly to me, "The county tractor station is coming to plow for us. To eradicate schistosomiasis, we have newly opened a drainage ditch about thirteen li long, preparing to convert all 2,007 mu of paddy fields in the cooperative into dry land." They are removing the field ridges to connect the fields into one, welcoming the tractors.

    I smiled knowingly. I thought: When "Fu Yuan" grows up, he will not know what schistosomiasis is!

### “复原”的诞生

　　“复原”的诞生
    程嘉楷
    1955年阴历3月16日，在安徽省歙县富堨乡汪本柏家里，一个新的生命诞生了。
    “恭喜，恭喜！是一个儿子呢。”接生婆说。
    汪本柏喜笑颜开，他赶忙把鸡蛋染红，在酒壶上插上柏枝，带着红鸡蛋和那壶酒，奔到二十五里路外的岳丈家去报喜。
    娘家的人高兴得要命。“包三月”出嫁九年啦，今天才得到这个喜报哟。第二天一早，小姨子鲍秀月，就把鸡蛋、红糖等礼物送到汪本柏家来祝贺。
    按照这里的风俗，在第三天，长辈伯祖母汪爱文便来给孩子命名。她仔细端详了酣睡的婴儿，又把目光转向健壮的产妇，笑着说：“你们夫妻俩是在身体复原后，才生这孩子的，就取名叫“复原”吧。
    “对呀，要不是共产党把我们的病治好，身体复原，我们的骨头早打鼓了，那会有今天？”产妇“包三月”说。
    是的，共产党挽救了“包三月”和汪本柏的生命，也同样挽救了千万人的生命。
    歙县富堨乡，是一个严重的血吸虫病区，解放以前，对于这种病人们没有一点儿办法。多少人被夺去了宝贵的生命。共产党来了，展开了大规模的防治血吸虫病的工作，把许许多多的人，从死亡边缘上挽救了出来，并教会了人们根治血吸虫病的办法。近几年来，人民政府在富堨乡就治愈了564名血吸虫病患者。“包三月”和汪本柏只是其中的两个人。
    1952年的时候，“包三月”和汪本柏已经是晚期血吸虫病患者，人瘦得皮包骨头，没有一点力气，整天偎在家里，田也荒了。村里人都叹息地说他们活不长远。那年，夫妻俩种八亩六分田，还是轮流栽种的，汪本柏强打起精神犁了田，“包三月”强栽上秧，这以后便再也没有力气侍弄庄稼，只得听任稻田荒芜了。等到稻子成熟，请人割了了事。八亩六分田只收了一千六百斤稻，一亩还摊不上二百斤。
    1952年11月间，当地人民政府送汪本柏到县城血吸虫病防治医院免费治病，因病床不够，“包三月”就暂时回娘家去住。
    第二年正月，汪本柏治好了病，精神愉快地从县里回来。他赶忙去接妻子，准备送进城去治疗。“包三月”这时已瘦成一副骨头架子，连说话的力气都没有了。
    1953年6月间，“包三月”也到县城血吸虫病防治医院去免费治疗。“包三月”并不姓“包”，原姓“鲍”。因为她身体太瘦弱，经不起注射锑剂，需要在医院里休养一个较长时间，医生为了解除她的顾虑，安慰她说：“包你三个月治好，放心吧。”所以，她治好病后，便叫“包三月”了。其实，“包三月”的病并不是三个月就治好的，她在医院里休养了将近半年，十二月二十二日开始注射锑剂，第二年——1954年1月26日才出院的。
    “包三月”和汪本柏治好了血吸虫病，生产劲头大了。农田里的活，样样自己干。去年还是那八亩六分田，收了三千六百斤稻，比1952年多收了二千斤。
    去年秋收以后，他们参加了红旗农业生产合作社。
    三月十七日，我访问了“包三月”家。
    “包三月”是个中等身材的青年妇女，今年还不到三十岁。她长着一个丰满的圆脸，穿着干净的蓝士林布褂，两根乌黑的发辫垂在胸前。“复原”偎在妈妈怀里，肥胖的小手向我招摇着。看见她母子身体这样健康，使我很难相信她以前是个临危的人。
    在一个土岗上，我找着了汪本柏。他正抡着锄头在作胜利百号山芋的温床育苗床。红旗社副主任汪秋棠对我说：汪本柏现在是社员中劳动工分得的最多的一个。
    我环顾四周，合作社的油菜花儿已一片金黄，可是许多社员还在田间忙碌着。
    “菜花都开了，他们在田里干什么呀？”我问。
    汪本柏兴奋地对我说，“县里拖拉机站就要来给我们代耕了。为了根治血吸虫病，我们新开了约十三华里长的排水沟，准备把全社2，007亩水田全部改为旱地。”他们就是在铲除田埂，要把田连成一片，迎接拖拉机。
    我会意地笑了。想：“复原”长大了，将不知道血吸虫病是什么回事了吧！
