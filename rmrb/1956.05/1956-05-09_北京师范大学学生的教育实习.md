　　北京师范大学学生的教育实习
    七日下午，北京师范大学历史系三年级进行教育实习的学生刘正均，在北京市第七中学初中三年级四班讲授了“世界近代史”第三册中的一课——十七世纪的荷兰。刘正均在四十五分钟内，比较恰当地运用了课堂教学的各个教学环节，有系统地按教案所准备的讲完了这一课。学生们聚精会神地听课，记着笔记，并随时回答他所提出的问题，这说明了课堂教学的效果很好。
    课后，在北京市教育局组织的教学评议会上，刘正均的这堂讲授获得参加听课者的一致好评。出席指导的北京师范大学的苏联专家库兹涅佐夫对这堂课作了全面的分析。他认为这堂课是在较高的水平上进行的，无论在教学内容和教学方法上都有很多的优点。
    北京师范大学这学期参加教育实习的有教育系、中国语文系、历史系等十一个系的三年级学生一千二百多人。他们从四月九日起，分散在北京市的四十多所中学、小学和幼儿园里，在指导教师的帮助下担任所学专业课的讲授和班主任助手的工作。实习期限共六周。
