Don't Forget the Lifeline of Economic Work
Duan Xianping

Currently, in the consolidation of agricultural producers' cooperatives and the development of the spring plowing and production campaign, neglecting the Party's political work is a prevalent deviation.

Recently, I visited some cooperatives in Qingjiang, Fengxin, and Jing'an counties in Jiangxi Province and found that many cooperatives have neither dedicated personnel responsible for political work nor established a system for political work. Cadres generally believe that with the complete socialist cooperativization, the relations of production have changed, the socialist consciousness of the members has been raised, and they will actively work without needing cadres to worry about them.

The reality, of course, is not like this. There are still many problems in the production aspects of the cooperatives and in the thinking of the members. For example, in some production teams of the Pingnan Cooperative in Yichun Township, Qingjiang, in order to increase fertilizer for their own team's fields, they did not hesitate to damage the interests of the entire cooperative by plowing under the densely packed rapeseed. The leading cadres of this cooperative did not adopt persuasive educational methods, but instead adopted simple and crude methods, stipulating that whoever plows under the rapeseed fields will be fined. Under this coercive order, although everyone no longer plowed under the rapeseed fields, they still did not understand the relationship between the interests of the production team and the entire cooperative.

Another example is the Tuanxi Cooperative in this county, where many members were unwilling to participate in the cooperative's re-election meeting. The leading cadres of the cooperative did not adopt persuasive educational methods, but simply stipulated that whoever does not participate in the re-election meeting will be fined. Although the members attended the meeting, no one spoke, because everyone did not understand what the re-election of the cooperative committee had to do with them.

This shows that it is wrong to relax the Party's political and ideological work in the cooperatives. All comrades engaged in rural work, and all cadres of the cooperatives, should carefully study and understand the instruction in an editor's note of the book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside": "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. This is especially true in a period when fundamental changes are taking place in the socio-economic system." "After the establishment of the cooperative, it must go through many struggles to consolidate itself. After it is consolidated, it may collapse if you relax even a little." Therefore, Party committees at all levels, especially county committees, should specifically help the Party organizations of the cooperatives to strengthen political work, establish a system for political work, and educate cadres to learn to use persuasive educational methods, and strive to consolidate the cooperatives!

    不要忘了经济工作的生命线
    段先萍
    目前，在巩固农业生产合作社和开展春耕生产运动中，忽视党的政治工作是带有普遍性的一种偏向。
    最近，我到江西省的清江、奉新、靖安等县的一些合作社去过，发现很多合作社既没有专人负责政治工作，也没有建立起政治工作的制度。干部们普遍认为，完全社会主义合作化了，生产关系改变了，社员的社会主义觉悟提高了，自己会积极劳动，用不着干部操心了。
    事实当然不是如此，在合作社的生产方面和社员的思想方面，都还有不少问题。比如清江宜春乡坪南合作社有的生产队，为了增加本队田里的肥料，不惜损害整个社的利益，把社里结实累累的油菜都翻掉了。这个社的领导干部也没有采取说服教育方法，而是采取了简单粗暴的办法，规定谁要翻掉油菜田，就罚谁。在这种强迫命令之下，大家虽然不翻油菜田了，但是还不懂得生产队和整个合作社利益一致的关系。
    又如这个县的团溪合作社，好多社员都不愿参加合作社的改选大会。社的领导干部也没有采取说服教育的办法，而简单地规定谁要不参加改选大会就罚谁。社员们虽然到会了，但谁都不发言，因为大家并不了解社委会的改选和自己究竟有什么关系。
    这说明，放松党在合作社中的政治思想工作是不应该的。所有的做农村工作的同志，所有合作社的干部，都应该很好地学习和领会“中国农村的社会主义高潮”一书的一个按语中指出的：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。在社会经济制度发生根本变革的时期，尤其是这样。”“合作社建立以后，还必须经过许多的斗争，才能使自己巩固起来。巩固了以后，只要一松劲，又可能垮台。”因此，各级党委，特别是县委会，应该具体地帮助合作社的党组织加强政治工作，建立政治工作制度，并且教育干部学会采用说服教育的办法，努力把合作社巩固起来！
