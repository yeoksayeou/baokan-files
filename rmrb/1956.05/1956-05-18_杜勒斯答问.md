    Dulles Answers Questions
    U.S. Secretary of State Dulles read a statement at a press conference on May 15 regarding the Soviet Union's reduction of armed forces. Dulles went to great lengths to make the Soviet disarmament action seem worthless. If we transcribed Dulles's remarks verbatim and reorganized them into a question-and-answer format, we could read the following dialogue:
    Q: Mr. Secretary, can you talk about your feelings about the Soviet Union's recent announcement of a reduction in armed forces?
    A: "I predicted last week before the House Foreign Affairs Committee... that the Soviet Union would be drawing a significant portion of its manpower from the armed forces to farms and factories."
    Q: A truly brilliant prediction. But people would certainly prefer to know your views.
    A: "I believe this action is based on economic factors. The way it can make cuts that are most beneficial to itself is to cut some people from its armed forces and have them return to factories and farms."
    Q: It is always a good thing for a country to demobilize its army to participate in peaceful economic and cultural construction. Does the United States also intend to follow suit? We all know that the United States talks a lot about its willingness for peace and easing international tensions.
    A: "The fact that they are transferring manpower from the standing army to factories does not necessarily create a situation where we believe we should also reduce our own army as a reward. The military power that these people produce in factories may be more threatening than if they were stationed in the army."
    Q: Oh, such an unheard-of high-level argument! Then what specific steps is the United States taking to ease international tensions and consolidate peace?
    A: "As you all know, in order to deal with what we perceive as the growing threat from Soviet Russia, we have recently had to increase military spending, asking Congress to add a considerable sum this year, I think nearly ten billion dollars."
    Q: So, disarmament increases the threat to peace, while continued arms expansion is conducive to peace. This reasoning is a bit profound. Can you explain it further?
    A: "Modern considerations mainly focus on the reduction of weapons that personnel can use. It should stipulate the reduction of weapons, which can be supervised more effectively than manpower."
    Q: But, Mr. Secretary, the Soviet Union is not only reducing the number of armed forces but also reducing armaments and combat equipment, and also reducing military expenditures in the Soviet state budget. As for the United States, as you just pointed out, it is now greatly increasing military spending. In this light, isn't your reasoning contradictory?
    A: This...

### 杜勒斯答问

    杜勒斯答问
    美国国务卿杜勒斯五月十五日在一次记者招待会上就苏联裁减武装部队事宣读了一篇声明。杜勒斯大费唇舌，想把苏联裁军行动说得一钱不值。如果把杜勒斯的谈话一字不易地摘录下来，从新组织成一篇答问，我们就可以读到下面这样一段对话：
    问：国务卿先生，你能谈谈对苏联最近宣布裁减武装部队一事的感想吗？
    答：“我上周曾在众议院外交委员会上……预言，苏联大约将要从武装部队中抽调很大一部分人力到农场和工厂去。”
    问：真是天才的预见。但是大家一定更愿意知道你的看法。
    答：“我认为这个行动根据的是经济因素。它能够进行削减而对自己最有好处的做法是从他的武装部队里削减一些人，让他们回到工厂和农庄去。”
    问：一个国家让军队复员参加经济和文化上的和平建设总是一件好事，美国也打算效法一下吗？我们都知道美国关于和平和缓和国际局势的意愿是谈得很多的。
    答：“他们把人力从常备军转到工厂并不一定就能造成我们认为我们应该也裁减自己的军队作为回报的那种情况，这些人在工厂里制造的军事力量也许比他们常驻在军队里的情况下更加有威胁性。”
    问：喔，高论闻所未闻！那末美国又采取什么具体的步骤来缓和国际局势，巩固和平呢？
    答：“你们都知道，为了对付我们所认为的来自苏俄的日益增长的威胁，我们最近不得不增加军事开支，要求国会在今年追加相当大一笔款项，我想是将近十亿美元。”
    问：如此说来，裁军增加对和平的威胁，继续扩军倒有利于和平，这个道理实在有点深奥，可以请你进一步解释一下吗？
    答：“现代的考虑主要是着眼于人员能够使用的武器的裁减方面。它应该规定裁减武器，武器是能够比人力更加有效地予以监督的。
    问：但是，国务卿先生，苏联不仅裁减武装部队人数，也裁减军备和战斗装备，并且还减少苏联国家预算中的军费支出哩。至于美国，正如你刚才指出的，现在还在大量增加军备费用。这样看来，你的道理不是自相矛盾了吗？
    答：这个……。
