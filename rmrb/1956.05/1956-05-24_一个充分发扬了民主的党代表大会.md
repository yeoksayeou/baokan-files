A Party Congress that Fully Promoted Democracy
    Hu Chichang

    The first Party Congress of Duyun County, Guizhou Province, was conducted from beginning to end in an atmosphere of fully promoting democracy and carrying out criticism and self-criticism.
    Before the opening of the Congress, the original County Committee had prepared the work report to the Congress with a very serious attitude. After the meeting began, the presidium emphasized that to hold the Congress well, it was necessary to carry out criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from the bottom up, and that the original members of the County Committee should humbly accept everyone's criticism. In his work report, the Secretary of the County Committee first made a relatively profound and comprehensive self-examination, and indicated that he welcomed the delegates to boldly raise criticisms and opinions.
    When discussing the work report of the County Committee, the delegates regarded the achievements of the County Committee in leading the masses over the past year as the victory and glory of the entire Party, and therefore summarized and affirmed them without omission. Then the delegates boldly exposed the shortcomings and mistakes of the original County Committee in its leadership work. For example, after criticizing right-leaning conservative ideas, the County Committee blindly raised production targets without proceeding from the actual conditions of the county. This year, the County Committee set two grain production increase targets: the one reported to the Prefectural Committee was an increase of 62.75%; the one required of the masses was an increase of 70%. The delegates believed that both of these targets were unrealistic. Everyone unanimously agreed that modifying this year's grain production increase target to 40.7% would be more in line with the actual situation of the county. Why did this phenomenon occur? The delegate from Fenglu District revealed the following fact: the original production target set by Fenglu District was an increase of 70% based on last year, which was already very high, but the County Committee said: "Maichong District has already set an increase of 100%, and you are only setting 70%!" As soon as the County Committee said this, a "thousand-jin district" appeared in Fenglu District. Meng Jingzhai, the Party Branch Secretary of Zifang Township, said: "At that time, in order to avoid the leaders criticizing us for being ideologically conservative, when other cooperatives shouted a thousand jin, I shouted twelve hundred, and when other cooperatives shouted twelve hundred, I shouted fifteen hundred. In short, if we couldn't complete it, they couldn't complete it either."
    The delegates also pointed out that the County Committee had the same tendency of emphasizing quantity over quality and blindly pursuing large projects in its guiding ideology for water conservancy construction. When the County Committee discussed water conservancy work with the District Committee Secretaries, the first question they asked almost every time was: how many large water conservancy projects with more than 10,000 workers do you have in your district? They did not pay enough attention to studying the construction of more and more realistic small-scale water conservancy projects, as if they thought that small-scale water conservancy projects were of no use. At the meeting, the delegates revealed that a large reservoir personally managed and constructed by the County Committee in Ying'en Township had used more than 20,000 workers and still could not guarantee the need for spring ploughing water. This practice clearly violated the policy of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily.
    The delegates also criticized the labor quota plan personally managed and formulated by the County Committee in Ying'en Agricultural Production Cooperative. Everyone criticized that the indicators of this quota plan were too high, and it would not work in other agricultural production cooperatives, let alone in this cooperative. The delegates said: We are very embarrassed holding this plan. If we implement it, the masses will not accept it; if we do not implement it, the leaders will criticize us for being ideologically conservative. Implementing this labor quota plan would "waste manpower and money."
    The delegates not only criticized the leadership work of the County Committee, but also raised opinions on the ideological style of the County Committee members. After Comrade Guan Yingcai, Secretary of the County Committee, reviewed his own arrogant attitude and lack of in-depth work, the delegates from Bagu, Wangsi, and Pinglang Districts further criticized him, saying that the Secretary of the County Committee rarely went to the remote ethnic minority areas to help with work. The delegates from Fenglu District also pointed out: Wangsi District piloted a cooperative with twenty-seven households, and thirteen households withdrew from the cooperative. The problems in the unified purchase and sale of grain in Pinglang District have not been resolved since last year. This has a lot to do with the Secretary of the County Committee not going deep and not understanding the situation. The delegates from Chengguan District said: The Chengguan District Committee is so close to the County Committee, but Comrade Guan Yingcai has only been there twice in more than a year since he came to Duyun.
    The Congress entered another central agenda item—electing the new County Committee and delegates to attend the Provincial Party Congress. The delegates strictly examined the nineteen County Committee candidates proposed by the presidium and raised sharp criticisms of their shortcomings and mistakes in ideology and work style. When the criticism was carried out comprehensively and deeply, the presidium promptly convened a meeting to study the criticisms and opinions of the delegates and dealt with them separately. For example, for individuals who were opposed by more than half of the delegates as County Committee candidates, their candidate qualifications were cancelled, and outstanding Party members who were satisfied by the delegates were proposed as County Committee candidates; for individual County Committee candidates who the delegates unanimously believed had not made a sufficiently deep examination, they were ordered to re-examine themselves and helped to recognize their mistakes. Other opinions raised by the delegates were also properly explained and dealt with one by one. In this way, the delegates were very satisfied, saying that every one of their opinions was valued and had been settled.
    The delegates' attitude towards reviewing the County Committee candidates was: for individual County Committee candidates whose mistakes were particularly serious and who could not face up to their shortcomings and mistakes and make an in-depth examination, they proposed to cancel their candidate qualifications; for those whose mistakes were more serious, but who were determined to correct their mistakes, the delegates still agreed that he could be a candidate for the County Committee, but designated him to make an examination to the Congress to see whether his examination was profound or not, and finally decided whether to elect him as a member of the County Committee or not; for those County Committee members who had been working actively and outstanding Party members who were absorbed from all aspects as candidates for the County Committee, the delegates unanimously agreed that they should be candidates for the County Committee, but they also raised criticisms of some of their existing shortcomings and mistakes. The delegates' reason for carefully reviewing the candidates can be answered from their speeches, they said: "The improvement and improvement of the production and life of 160,000 people in Duyun County are entirely entrusted to the leadership of the County Committee. If incompetent people are elected, it will bring great losses to the Party and losses to the people of Duyun County!", the nineteen County Committee members elected in this way were all the people the delegates wanted to elect.
    The Congress also elected five delegates to attend the Provincial Party Congress with the same serious and responsible attitude.

    一个充分发扬了民主的党代表大会
    胡耻昌
    贵州省都匀县的首次党代表大会，自始至终，都是在充分发扬民主，开展批评和自我批评的气氛中进行的。
    在开大会以前，原县委就以十分严肃的态度准备了向代表大会的工作报告。会议开始后，主席团强调要开好大会，一定要开展批评和自我批评特别是自下而上的批评，原县委委员要虚心接受大家的批评。县委书记在作工作报告中，首先作了比较深刻的全面的自我检查；并且表明欢迎代表们大胆提出批评和意见。
    在讨论县委的工作报告的时候，代表们把县委一年来领导群众所取得的工作成就，看作是全党的胜利和光荣，因此，毫无遗漏地加以总结和肯定。接着代表们大胆地揭露了原县委在领导工作中的缺点和错误。例如在批判了右倾保守思想之后，县委不从本县实际情况出发，盲目地提高生产指标。今年县委订的粮食增产指标有两个：向地委报告的是增产62.75％；向群众要求的是增产70％。代表们认为这两个指标都不切合实际。大家一致认为将今年的粮食增产指标，修改为40.7％才切合本县实际情况。为什么会发生这样的现象呢？凤麓区代表揭露出来这样的事实：凤麓区原订的生产指标是在去年基础上增产70％，实际上已经很高，但是县委说：“麦冲区已订增产100％了，你们才订70％！”县委这样一说，凤麓区的“千斤区”就出现了。纸房乡党支书蒙敬斋说：“当时，为了避免领导批评我们思想保守，别的社喊千斤的时候，我就喊一千二，别的社喊一千二，我就喊一千五，总之，我们完不成，他们也完不成。”
    代表们又指出：县委在兴修水利的指导思想上，同样存在着重量不重质、盲目贪大的思想倾向。县委同区委书记研究水利工作的时候，几乎每次第一句问的总是：你那区一万个工以上的大水利工程有几处。而对于研究兴修更多更现实的小型水利则重视不够，好像认为小型水利无济于事。会上，代表们揭露了县委在迎恩乡亲自掌握兴修的一个大型水库，用去了二万多个工，还不能保证春耕用水的需要。这种做法显然违背了勤俭办社的方针。
    代表们对县委在迎恩农业生产合作社亲自掌握制定的劳动定额方案，也提出了批评。大家批评这个定额方案的指标是偏高的，不但在其他农业生产合作社行不通，就是在本社也行不通。代表们说：我们拿着这个方案很为难，往下贯彻执行，群众不接受；不贯彻执行，领导又要批评我们思想保守。实行这个劳动定额方案就要“劳民伤财”。
    代表们不仅对县委的领导工作提出了批评，而且对县委委员的思想作风，也都提出了意见。在县委书记管英才同志检讨了自己的骄傲情绪、工作不深入以后，坝固、王司、平浪三个区的代表都进一步地向他提出了批评，说县委书记很少深入到边沿少数民族地区帮助工作。凤麓区的代表也提出：王司区试办了一个二十七户的合作社，就有十三户退了社，平浪区的粮食统销中的问题，从去年闹到现在还没有解决，这和县委书记不深入不了解情况有很大关系。城关区的代表说：城关区委会离县委这样近，管英才同志来都匀一年多，只去过两次。
    大会进入另一个中心议题——选举新的县委会和出席省党代大会的代表。代表们严格地审查了主席团提出来的十九名县委候选人，对他们思想作风方面的缺点和错误，都提出了尖锐的批评。当批评全面深入开展起来后，主席团及时召开了会议，研究代表们的批评和意见，分别作了处理。如对半数代表都不同意作为县委候选人的个别人，就取消候选人资格，提出代表们所满意的优秀党员作为县委候选人；对于代表们一致认为检查不够深入的个别县委候选人，责成他重新检查，并帮助他认识自己的错误。对代表们提出的其他意见也都一一做了妥善的交代和处理。这样，代表们都很满意，说自己的每条意见都被重视，都有着落。
    代表们对审查县委候选人的态度是：对其中错误特别严重的，而又不能正视自己的缺点和错误作深入检查的个别县委候选人，就提议取消他的候选人资格；对错误虽较严重，但有决心改正错误的，代表们仍同意他作为县委候选人，不过指定他向大会作检查，看他检查的深刻与否最后才确定选或不选他为县委委员；对于那些原来就积极工作的县委委员，和从各方面吸收进来作为县委候选人的优秀党员，代表们一致赞同他们作为县委候选人，但对他们存在的某些缺点和错误，也都提出了批评。代表所以这样认真的审查候选人可以从他们的发言中得到答复，他们说：“都匀县十六万人民生产和生活的提高和改善，完全寄托于县委的领导，如果选举了不能胜任的人，就会给党带来很大的损失，给都匀县人民带来损失！”，这样选出来的十九名县委委员，都是代表们所要选举的人。
    大会还以同样认真负责的态度，选出了五名出席省党代表大会的代表。
