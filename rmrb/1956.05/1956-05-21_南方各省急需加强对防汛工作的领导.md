Xinhua News Agency, 20th - The person in charge of the Central Flood Control Headquarters spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter today on the issue of water level changes in major rivers in southern provinces and the urgent need to strengthen flood control preparation work.

The person in charge said that since April, rainfall has been common throughout the country, and the drought in arid areas has also been relieved. After entering early May, heavy rains appeared continuously in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The rainfall at the Nancheng Station of the Fu River in Jiangxi Province reached 116 millimeters on May 8, and the rainfall at the Hengshui Station of the Xiang River and the Shaoyang Station of the Zi River in Hunan Province also reached 50 to 70 millimeters on May 7. Due to the continuous and concentrated rainfall, the water levels of rivers in these areas rose sharply, bringing the flood season forward. At present, the water levels of the Xiang River, Zi River, and Yuan River in Hunan Province, as well as the Xiu River, Xin River, and Fu River in Jiangxi Province, the Min River in Fujian Province, and the Pujiang River in Zhejiang Province, have all at one time exceeded the warning water level. Currently, the water levels of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and its major tributaries are mostly close to or exceed the water levels of the same period in 1954.

He said that the Party and government leading organs and agricultural and water conservancy departments of the above-mentioned provinces are now actively taking measures to carry out flood control work. Guangdong, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hubei and other provinces have successively convened flood control meetings to study and deploy flood control work, and have restored or established flood control command organizations. Preparations have also been made in terms of flood control materials. However, some areas have not done enough in flood control preparations. These areas must further conduct in-depth inspections, earnestly do a good job in organization and mobilization, and make specific arrangements for flood control preparation work. It is necessary to correct the blindly optimistic and other paralyzing thoughts about flood control work in some areas. It must be recognized that doing a good job in flood control is one of the important measures to ensure agricultural production. At the same time, leading organs at all levels must seize the opportunity to conduct a general inspection of river embankments, and pay close attention to dangerous sections. In addition, vigilance must also be heightened against mountain floods and inland waterlogging, and specific preventive measures must be taken to avoid creating passivity in work and undue losses.

The person in charge emphasized that there are many small rivers in the southern provinces of China, and the affected area is wide. Any paralysis or negligence in flood control work will cause huge losses in agricultural production and other aspects. Therefore, during this year's flood season, leading organs at all levels must not only strengthen flood control work on large rivers, but also strengthen flood control work on small rivers.

He particularly pointed out that strengthening the inspection of small reservoirs is an important task in the flood control work of agricultural departments and water conservancy departments in various places this year. Since October 1955, more than 20,000 small reservoirs have been built across the country, some with dam heights of more than 20 meters; however, according to local inspections, about 20% are of poor quality. Therefore, agricultural departments and water conservancy departments in various places must lead the masses to conduct a general inspection of small reservoirs, and repair and reinforce those of poor quality in a timely manner to avoid serious accidents during the flood season.

### 南方各省急需加强对防汛工作的领导

    南方各省急需加强对防汛工作的领导
    新华社20日讯　中央防汛总指挥部负责人今天就目前南方各省大江、河流的水情变化和急需加强防汛准备工作的问题，向新华社记者发表谈话。
    这位负责人说，自四月以来，全国各地都普遍降了雨，干旱地区的旱象也解除了。进入五月上旬以后，长江中下游地区又连续出现了暴雨。江西省抚河南城站五月八日雨量达一百十六公厘，湖南省湘水衡水站和资水邵阳站五月七日降雨量也都达到五十到七十公厘。由于雨量连续和集中，这些地区河流的水位急剧上涨，使汛期提前到来。现在，湖南省的湘水、资水和沅水以及江西省的修水、信江、抚河、福建省的闽江、浙江省的浦阳江等河流的水位，都曾经一度超过警戒水位。目前，长江干流中游及长江的各主要支流的水位，大都接近或超过1954年同期水位。
    他说，上述这些省的党、政领导机关和农业水利部门现在正在积极采取措施，开展防汛工作。广东、江西、浙江、湖北等省都先后召开了防汛会议，对防汛工作进行了研究和布置，并且恢复或成立了防汛指挥机构。在防汛物料等方面也都作了准备。但是，有些地区的防汛准备工作还做得很不够，这些地区必需进一步深入检查，切实做好组织动员工作，作出防汛准备工作的具体安排；纠正某些地区对防汛工作盲目乐观等麻痹思想，必须认识，做好防汛工作，是保证农业生产的重要措施之一。同时，各级领导机关还必须抓紧时机对江、河堤防进行普遍检查，对险要的地段更需严加注意。此外，对山洪内涝也必须提高警惕，作出具体的预防措施，以避免造成工作上的被动和不应有的损失。
    这位负责人强调说，中国南方各省小河流多，影响面积广；在防汛工作上的任何麻痹疏忽，都会造成农业生产等方面的巨大损失。因此，在今年汛期内，各级领导机关不但对大江、大河要加强防汛工作，对于小河的防汛工作也必须加强。
    他特别指出，加强对小型水库的检查，是今年各地农业部门和水利部门防汛工作中的一个重要任务。自1955年10月以来，全国各地兴修的小型水库有两万多座，有的坝高二十多公尺；但据各地检查，质量不好的约占20％。因此，各地农业部门和水利部门必须领导人民群众对小型水库进行普遍检查，对质量不好的要及时进行整修加固，以免在汛期发生严重事故。
