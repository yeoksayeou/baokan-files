To the Editor:

    In early January of this year, in order to solve the problem of spring planting seeds in Fujian Province, the leading organs decided that Zhejiang Province would transfer a batch of corn seeds to Fujian Province within January. The Ministry of Food submitted a temporary plan to the Ministry of Railways, requesting that cars be allocated for shipment within January, and it was approved by the Ministry of Railways. On January 19th, the staff of the Ministry of Food's Transportation Department wrote a letter, along with the approved car request plan from the Ministry of Railways, and handed it to the department's mail clerk to send to the Zhejiang Provincial Grain Bureau. However, the Zhejiang Provincial Grain Bureau only received the official letter and did not see the car request plan. Without the car request plan, the station could not allocate cars. Therefore, the Provincial Grain Bureau inquired with the Ministry of Food by telegram and long-distance telephone, and the staff in charge also felt at a loss. Upon checking in the department, it turned out that this urgent car request plan was still in the department's mail clerk's file folder, ready to be archived! Although it was immediately resent, the time was already too late.

    Such things happen frequently in the Ministry of Food's Transportation Department. In March of this year, there were two incidents of sending the wrong transportation plans. Once, the railway car request plan that should have been sent to the Hubei Provincial Grain Bureau was sent to Shaanxi Province, while the one that should have been sent to the Shaanxi Provincial Grain Bureau was sent to Hubei Province; another time, the transportation plan that should have been sent to the Shanxi Provincial Grain Bureau was sent to Anhui Province, while the one that should have been sent to the Anhui Provincial Grain Bureau was sent to Shanxi Province. In January of this year, a transportation plan that they sent to the Hubei Provincial Grain Bureau should have been sent at once, but it was sent in three separate shipments, causing the staff in charge of the Hubei Provincial Grain Bureau to search and inquire everywhere. In November of last year, they sent a letter concerning transportation plan issues that should have been sent to the Hubei Provincial Grain Bureau to the Hunan Provincial Grain Bureau.

    This frequent mis-sending of documents by the Ministry of Food's Transportation Department has already caused undue losses to the work and must be corrected immediately.　Wu Xuecheng

### 粮食部调运司经常错发文件

    粮食部调运司经常错发文件编辑同志：
    今年一月上旬，为了解决福建省春耕种子问题，领导机关决定在一月份内由浙江省调一批玉米种子给福建省。粮食部向铁道部提出了临时计划，请求在一月份内配车发运，并且得到了铁道部的批准。粮食部调运司经办人员就在一月十九日写了便函，连同铁道部批准的要车计划交司里的收发同志寄给浙江省粮食厅。但是，浙江省粮食厅只接到了公函，并没有见到要车计划，而没有要车计划车站是不能拨车的。于是，省粮食厅就用电报、长途电话向粮食部查询，经办人员也感到茫然。到司里一查，原来这紧急要车计划还放在司收发的卷宗夹内准备归档呢！这时虽然马上补寄了，而时间已经晚了。
    这样的事情，在粮食部调运司是经常发生的。今年三月份就发生了两次发错运输计划的事情。一次把应该发给湖北省粮食厅的铁路要车计划发到了陕西省，而把应该发给陕西省粮食厅的却发到了湖北省；另外一次把应该发给山西省粮食厅的运输计划发给了安徽省，而把应该发给安徽省粮食厅的发到了山西省。今年一月份，他们发给湖北省粮食厅的一份运输计划，应该是一次寄去的，但是却分成三次寄，使湖北省粮食厅经办人员到处寻找询问。去年十一月份，他们把应该发给湖北省粮食厅的有关运输计划问题的函件寄到湖南省粮食厅去了。
    粮食部调运司这种经常错发文件的现象，已经使工作受到了不应有的损失，必须立即纠正才好。　吴学成
