Why Do Highly Skilled Artisans Earn Less?
The Average Wage Standard of Egalitarianism in Yantai City's Lace and Embroidery Production Should Be Changed

Editor Comrades:

Many handicrafts produced in Yantai City are famous in our country: exquisite lace, beautiful and elegant net扣 (net-buckle) and linen embroidery products (pillowcases, bedspreads, tablecloths, napkins, etc.), and delicate and lovely colored woolen embroidery products are all welcomed by users at home and abroad. Some time ago, I visited the Yantai City Famous Products and Handicrafts Exhibition, and several woolen embroidered handicrafts, like beautiful oil paintings, attracted me.

Some highly skilled artisans in Yantai City have participated in the two processing factories led by the Yantai City Arts and Crafts Export Company and the Yantai City Embroidery Production Cooperative. However, it is said that many workers are not content with their work, thinking that "anything is better than doing this." The reason is that their wages are too low. A skilled worker earns only about 20 yuan or even 15 yuan per month. This spring, many apprentices who were newly recruited last year and are now able to produce independently have left the processing factories and embroidery cooperatives and transferred to other production departments. I think this situation is worth noting.

In order to prevent these valuable handicrafts from being in danger of "the art dying with the artist," I hope that the relevant departments in Yantai City will solve the problem of low wages in lace and embroidery production. Tian Qing

Investigation Report from the People's Daily Reader's Letter Department

The situation reflected in reader Tian Qing's letter is correct.

Yantai City's lace, net扣 (net-buckle), linen, and woolen embroidery production has a history of several decades. Before the Anti-Japanese War, there were more than 10,000 workers producing these products, and the products were sold to Europe, America, and Southeast Asia. During the Anti-Japanese War, the production of these handicrafts stagnated. After the liberation of Yantai, the People's Government began to organize and lead the production of lace and embroidery. Now, there are about 1,000 lace and embroidery workers in the city (not counting those scattered in rural areas), led by the Yantai City Arts and Crafts Company and the Handicraft Cooperative Union. Their wages are calculated as follows: for woolen embroidery, more than 6,000 stitches per day is considered a standard work unit; for linen embroidery, 60 to 70 lines per day is considered standard (hand-held lace and net扣 (net-buckle) are also based on lines); each standard work unit is worth 7 jiao. This wage standard is not only too low, but it also fails to implement the principle of rewarding quality work. Therefore, people who do fine work are not easy to meet the standard, and their income is less than those who do rough work. For example, Shi Guiqing, Tian Shulan, Mou Shuzhen, Li Weilan, and other highly skilled linen embroidery workers in the processing factories under the Arts and Crafts Company can only do 40 to 50 lines a day, and their monthly income is only 15 or 16 yuan, which is about the same as the highest income among young workers who have just graduated.

Because of this, many workers, especially young people, are not content with doing this kind of work. Last year, the two processing factories and the embroidery cooperative recruited a total of 400 apprentices, but now there are only more than 200 left.

Now, although the Yantai Arts and Crafts Company is preparing to increase the wage for each standard work unit from 7 jiao to 9 jiao, this has not changed the unreasonable phenomenon of not rewarding quality work. Therefore, it is recommended that they and the Handicraft Cooperative Union jointly study and formulate product quality specifications and worker technical grades, and determine wages based on the quality and quantity of work. This will increase workers' enthusiasm for production, encourage workers to care about quality, and delve into technology. In addition, a plan for cultivating new people should be formulated. At the same time, a certain technical exchange system and political and ideological education system should be established in each processing factory and embroidery cooperative to encourage older workers to help young workers improve their skills, and young workers to humbly learn skills from older workers, so that every worker can gradually improve their socialist consciousness, love and do their work well.

### 为什么技术高的手工艺人收入反而少

    为什么技术高的手工艺人收入反而少
    烟台市花边、刺绣生产中平均主义的工资标准应该改变编辑同志：
    烟台市生产的不少手工艺品是我国有名的：玲珑透剔的花边，美观大方的网扣和麻布绣花制品（枕套、被套、桌布、餐巾等），精致可爱的彩色绒线绣制品，都受到国内外使用者的欢迎。前些日子我去参观了烟台市著名产品及手工艺品的展览会，几幅绒线绣成的工艺品像优美的油画一样吸引着我。
    烟台市一些技术较高的手工艺人，已经分别参加了烟台市工艺品出口公司所领导的二个加工厂和烟台市绣花生产合作社。但是，据说很多工人不安心于自己的工作，认为“不管做什么也比做这个强”。原因是她们的工资太低了，一个熟练工人每月大约收入只有二十元甚至十五元。今年春天，就有不少去年新招收来而现在已经能够独立生产的学徒工离开了加工厂和绣花社，转到别的生产部门去了。我认为这个情况是值得注意的。
    为了不让这些宝贵的手工艺受到“人亡艺绝”的危险，希望烟台市有关部门解决花边刺绣生产中存在的工资偏低的问题。　田青
    本报读者来信部的调查报告
    读者田青来信所反映的情况是正确的。
    烟台市的花边、网扣、麻布和绒线绣花生产已有几十年的历史。在抗战以前，生产这种产品的工人共有一万多人，产品一直远销欧美各国和南洋各地。在抗战期间，这些手工艺品的生产一度停滞。烟台解放后，人民政府就开始着手组织和领导花边、刺绣的生产，现在全市共有花边、刺绣工人约一千人左右（分散在农村各地的不算），分别由烟台市工艺品公司和手工业合作社联合社领导。她们的工资是这样计算的：绒线绣花以每天绣六千多针作为一个标准工，麻布绣花以每天做六、七十根线作为标准（手拿花边和网扣都是以线为标准）；每一标准工合七角钱。这种工资标准不但过低，而且没有贯彻优质优酬的原则。因此，做活精细的人不易达到标准，收入反而比做活粗糙的人收入少。像工艺品公司所属加工厂的石桂卿、田淑兰、牟树真、李维兰等技术最高的麻布绣花工人，每天只能做四、五十根线，每月只能收入十五、六元，和出师不久的青年工人中收入最高的差不多。
    因为这样，许多工人，特别是年轻人就很不安心于做这种工作。去年两个加工厂和绣花社一共招收了四百名徒工，可是到现在只剩下二百多人了。
    现在，虽然烟台工艺品公司已经准备把每一标准工的工资由七角提高到九角；但是这并没有改变优质不优酬的不合理的现象。因此，建议他们和手工业合作社联合社共同研究，订出产品的质量规格标准和工人的技术等级，根据活计的质量高低和数量多少确定工资。这样才能提高工人生产的积极性，鼓励工人关心质量，钻研技术。此外，还应该订出培养新人的计划，同时在各加工厂和绣花社建立一定的技术交流制度和政治思想教育工作制度，鼓励老年工人帮助青年工人提高技术，青年工人虚心向老年工人学习技术；使每个工人都能逐步提高社会主义觉悟，热爱和做好自己的工作。
