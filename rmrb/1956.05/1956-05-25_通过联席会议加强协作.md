    Strengthening Collaboration Through Joint Meetings
    Li Qian
    Since January of this year, the Northwest First Engineering Company (hereinafter referred to as Party B) and the construction unit (hereinafter referred to as Party A) have always consulted with each other when formulating plans, so that the plans can be coordinated with each other. The two sides have also supported each other in terms of manpower and materials, thus ensuring fast project progress and good quality.
    Before January of this year, Party A and Party B often argued over issues such as plans, quality, and temporary construction expenses. Each time Party B made a construction plan, it only listed the projects that had all the necessary conditions, and was unwilling to include projects that could be started through effort. Party A often failed to take into account Party B's specific difficulties and set the plan too high. On the issue of quality, Party A's requirements were often relatively high, while some cadres of Party B paid more attention to the progress of the project and were not strict enough on quality requirements. Therefore, Party A and Party B often argued fiercely on the issue of quality, which even affected the progress of the project.
    At the beginning of January this year, the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a basic construction meeting, at which it criticized the departmentalism of both Party A and Party B. The meeting also believed that the poor relationship between Party A and Party B in the past was caused not only by departmentalism on both sides, but also by a lack of mutual understanding of the situation. Therefore, the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to hold regular meetings attended by the person in charge of the Municipal Committee's Basic Construction Department, the heads of Party A and Party B, the design unit, and the local support units to study and solve problems that could not be solved by the units themselves. Under the leadership of the Basic Construction Department of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Party B and Party A began to hold weekly joint meetings. Through these meetings, the leaders of both sides understood each other's work situation and no longer complained about each other. When Party A learned that some of Party B's machinery was not available, it lent its existing welding machines and cranes to Party B. When it learned that Party B's material supply was insufficient, it sent cadres to help Party B purchase or borrow materials from other places. Party B used to complain that Party A could not deliver drawings on time, but now it helps Party A jointly urge the design unit. Sometimes, if the drawings really can't be delivered, it does other projects to make up for the loss of not completing the task. Problems that were not easy to solve at the lower levels can be solved quickly by discussing them at the meeting by the leaders of both sides. For example, when Party B's prefabrication yard was about to start construction, the light railway in the factory had not yet been laid because it could not buy rails. In the past, several construction units had rails that were not temporarily in use, but because some were afraid that the quality of the rails Party B would return in the future would not be good, and some were afraid that a late return would affect the completion of their own factory construction tasks, no one was willing to take them out. After Party B explained the advantages and disadvantages of not having light rails at the joint meeting, Party A agreed to take out some rails to support the prefabrication yard.
    The joint meeting of Party A and Party B also solved the problem of insufficient cadres in Party B. In January, Party B had about 1,000 fewer cadres than the state-stipulated establishment. Some construction sites were so chaotic due to the weakness of the cadre force that it seriously affected the completion of construction tasks. Although the Northwest Engineering Administration Bureau promised to transfer some cadres to the Engineering Company, it could not transfer them in a very short period of time. The leaders of Party B also raised this issue at the joint meeting. The leading comrades of the Basic Construction Department of the Xi'an Municipal Committee suggested that the cadres of Party A and Party B on the construction site should be used together, so as to strengthen the cadre force at the grassroots level. After the cadres of the two sides were merged and used, some Party A representatives served as secretaries of the Party Committee of the work area, and some served as deputy directors of the work area in charge of production. The technical supervision section of Party A and the technical groups of the work area were merged to form a technical inspection station, which was directly under the leadership of the work area. These cadres are responsible to Party A and also to the progress of the project. They understand the situation of Party A and also the work situation of Party B. In the past, things that were prone to disputes between Party A and Party B could be easily resolved by these cadres reporting to their superiors. In terms of quality supervision, in the past, if Party A's engineering and technical personnel found quality problems, they did not have the right to order workers to stop work or rework, and had to report to Party A's site representative, who would then find Party B's district director, sometimes requiring official documents to be exchanged, which often delayed time, turning small rework into large rework. After the merger, all inspection personnel became cadres of the work area, and quality problems could be dealt with in a timely manner.
    At present, although the cooperative relationship between Party B and Party A has made great progress, there are still disputes over issues such as the price difference of substitute materials. This requires cadres of both sides to further overcome departmentalism, strengthen the overall concept, and solve problems realistically.

    通过联席会议加强协作
    李茜
    今年一月以来，西北第一工程公司（下称乙方）和建设单位（下称甲方）制定计划的时候，总是互相商量，使计划能够互相衔接。双方又从人力、物力等方面，互相支援，因而保证了工程进度快和质量好。
    在今年一月以前，甲、乙双方常常为计划、质量和暂设工程费用等问题争执不休。乙方每次订施工计划，往往只把具备各种条件的项目列进去，而不愿把经过努力可以争取开工的项目列入计划。甲方则往往不照顾乙方的具体困难，把计划订得过高。在质量问题上往往是甲方要求比较高，乙方有些干部则对工程进度注意的多，对质量要求不严，因此，甲、乙双方在质量问题上也往往争执得很厉害，甚至影响工程进度。
    今年一月初，中共西安市委召开了基本建设会议，在会上批判了甲、乙双方的本位主义思想。会议还认为，过去甲、乙双方关系不好，除了因为双方面的本位主义思想作怪以外，有时也是互相不了解情况所造成的。因此，中共西安市委就决定定期召开有市委基本建设部负责人，甲、乙双方和设计单位、地方支援单位负责人参加的会议，研究解决有关各单位之间不能自行解决的问题。乙方和甲方在市委基本建设部的领导下，开始举行每周一次的甲、乙双方联席会议。通过这种会议，双方领导人员都了解了对方的工作情况，也就不再互相抱怨了。甲方知道乙方某些机械供应不上，就把自己现有的电焊机和起重机等借给乙方；知道乙方材料供应不足，就抽出干部帮助乙方到外地采购或借材料。乙方过去抱怨甲方不能按期交图纸，现在则帮助甲方共同催设计单位，有时图纸实在到不了，就做其他工程来弥补完不成任务的损失。过去下边不容易解决的问题，通过双方领导人在会上商量，很快就能解决了。如乙方预制场即将开工的时候，厂内的轻便铁道还没有铺好，原因是买不到铁轨。过去，几个建设单位都有暂时不用的铁轨，但是，因为有的怕乙方将来还的铁轨质量不好，有的怕还迟了影响自己建厂任务的完成，谁也不愿拿出来。乙方在联席会上说明没有轻便铁轨的利害后，甲方就同意拿一部分铁轨来支援预制场了。
    甲、乙双方联席会议还解决了乙方干部力量不足的问题。一月份乙方的干部比国家规定的编制少一千人左右，有些工地因为干部力量太弱，管理很混乱，严重地影响施工任务的完成。西北工程管理局虽然答应抽调一部分干部给工程公司，但是也不能在很短时间内抽调出来。乙方的领导人员在联席会上也把这个问题提出来了。西安市委基本建设部领导同志建议把甲、乙双方在工地上的干部合起来使用，这样就可以加强基层的干部力量。双方干部合并使用后，有些甲方代表担任工区党委书记，有的担任管生产的工区副主任。甲方的技术监督科和工区的技术组合并起来成立了技术检查站，直接受工区领导。这些干部既要对甲方负责，又要对工程进度负责，他们既了解甲方的情况，又了解乙方的工作情况。过去甲、乙双方容易发生争执的事，通过这些干部向领导上反映就比较容易解决。在质量监督方面，过去有时甲方工程技术人员发现质量有问题，他没有权利命令工人停工或返工，只好反映给甲方的工地代表，代表再找乙方的区主任，有时还需要公文往返，往往因此拖延时间，把小返工拖成大返工。合并起来以后，所有的检查人员都成了工区的干部，发现质量有问题就可以及时处理。
    目前，乙方和甲方的配合协作关系虽然有很大进步，但是，遇到代用材料差价等问题仍有争吵，这就需要双方干部进一步克服本位主义思想，加强整体观念，实事求是地解决问题。
