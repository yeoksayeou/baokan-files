Nanjing Institute of Technology has promoted thirty teaching assistants to lecturers since the end of last year. These newly promoted lecturers had all been working as teaching assistants before 1952. Through ideological remolding and teaching reform, they have greatly improved both politically and professionally. Before their promotion, many of them were already responsible for lecturing duties, and some also served as department secretaries, deputy directors of teaching and research groups, and secretaries of teaching and research groups.

    南京工学院提升一批助教为讲师
    南京工学院自去年年底以来，已有三十名助教被提升为讲师。这些新提升的讲师都是在1952年以前就担任助教工作的。他们通过思想改造和教学改革，在政治上、业务上都获得了很大的提高，其中很多同志在提升之前就担负了讲师的教学工作，有的还担任了系秘书、教研组副主任和教研组秘书等职务。
