    Cellophane Successfully Trial-Produced

    Cellophane, which China was previously unable to manufacture, was successfully trial-produced by the Tianjin No. 1 People's Paper Mill in early May. It will soon be officially put into production. Cellophane is the best packaging material for valuable instruments, precision machinery, and many food products.

    In April and May, the Tianjin paper industry also produced moisture-proof paper, fireproof paper, reinforced moisture-proof paper, oil-resistant paper, and fruit wrapping paper.

    玻璃纸试制成功
    我国过去不能制造的玻璃纸，五月初由天津市第一人民造纸厂试制成功。不久将正式投入生产。玻璃纸是贵重仪器和精密机械以及许多食品的最好的包装用纸。
    天津市造纸业在四、五两个月中，还制成了防潮纸、防火纸、加线防潮纸、防油纸和包装水果用纸等。
