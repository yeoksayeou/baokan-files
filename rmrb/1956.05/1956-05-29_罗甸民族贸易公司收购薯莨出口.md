The Luodian National Trading Company in the Luodian Buyi Autonomous County, Guizhou Province, has purchased a large quantity of Dioscorea cirrhosa, an industrial raw material, for sale abroad.

Dioscorea cirrhosa is a raw material for making baked glue and is a wild plant. In the past, the Buyi farmers here did not know the use of Dioscorea cirrhosa and did not consider it a valuable commodity. In the first half of 1955, the Luodian National Trading Company signed a contract with the Guangxi Export Company to purchase and sell Dioscorea cirrhosa. The 150,000 jin sold in the fourth quarter of last year were well received by Japanese manufacturers. The Luodian National Trading Company plans to purchase 800,000 jin by October this year, and has already purchased 340,000 jin.

    罗甸民族贸易公司收购薯莨出口
    贵州省罗甸布依族自治县民族贸易公司，收购大批工业原料——薯莨，销售国外。
    薯莨是炼烤胶的原料，是一种野生植物。过去这里的布依族农民，不知道薯莨的用途，拿着不当好东西看待。1955年上半年，罗甸民族贸易公司同广西出口公司订立了购销薯莨的合同。去年第四季度销售的十五万斤，得到日本厂商的好评。罗甸民族贸易公司今年计划到十月份收购八十万斤，现在已经收购了三十四万斤。
