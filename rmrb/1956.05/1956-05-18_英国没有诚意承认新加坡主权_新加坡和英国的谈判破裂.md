Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch from London: The negotiations in London regarding Singapore's future political status broke down on May 15th.

The communique issued after the final negotiation meeting stated that both sides "reluctantly agreed that a point has been reached where further talks would not be useful."

These negotiations, which began on April 23rd, were deadlocked over the issue of control of internal security after Singapore's independence, and the negotiations broke down on this issue.

According to a statement issued by the British Colonial Office on the evening of May 15th, Britain advocated for the establishment of a Defense and Security Committee composed of representatives from the Singapore government and the United Kingdom government, with the British High Commissioner serving as chairman. The statement said that this proposal was in consideration of Singapore being an important strategic base in the "free world defense system."

The British Colonial Office's statement said: At the last moment, Singapore's Chief Minister Marshall said that most members of the Singapore delegation reluctantly agreed to retain the powers requested by the British government, but with two conditions: the use of these powers would be in accordance with the recommendations of the Defense and Security Committee, and British representatives on the committee would not constitute a majority. Britain refused to accept these conditions.

Singapore's Chief Minister Marshall issued a statement on the evening of May 15th, accusing Britain of fundamentally lacking sincerity in recognizing Singapore's sovereignty. He said that if Britain's proposal were accepted, the British government could, under various circumstances, interfere in Singapore's internal affairs through a Defense and Security Committee. The statement said that the British sought powers that were beyond all reason, which the Singapore delegation absolutely could not accept. In fact, it took back with one hand what it offered with the other.

Marshall also pointed out at a press conference held on the same day that Britain's argument was that as long as Britain wanted to continue to maintain a base in Singapore, the people of Singapore could not achieve self-government.

Marshall said that his delegation was willing to make concessions to allow Britain to continue to maintain its base in Singapore, but "we are not prepared to completely submit."

Marshall indicated that he would resign after returning to Singapore.

    英国没有诚意承认新加坡主权
    新加坡和英国的谈判破裂
    新华社16日电　伦敦消息：在伦敦举行的关于新加坡未来政治地位的谈判在五月十五日宣告破裂。
    在最后一次谈判会议后发表的公报说：双方“迫不得已地一致认为：已经达到了进一步会谈不会有任何有用的意义这样一种地步。”
    这次谈判从四月二十三日开始起就在对新加坡独立后内部安全的控制权问题上陷于僵局，谈判也是在这个问题上破裂的。
    根据英国殖民部在五月十五日晚上发表的声明，英国主张设立一个防御和安全委员会，委员会由新加坡政府和联合王国政府代表组成，以英国的高级专员担任主席。声明说，这个建议是考虑到新加坡是“自由世界防御体系”中一个重要的战略基地。
    英国殖民部的声明说：在最后一刻，新加坡首席部长马歇尔说，新加坡代表团大部分团员勉强同意保留英国政府所要求的权力，但是必须附有两个条件：这些权力的使用将依照防御和安全委员会的建议，而委员会中的英国代表不得占多数。英国拒绝接受这些条件。
    新加坡首席部长马歇尔在五月十五日晚上发表的一项声明中指责英国根本没有诚意承认新加坡的主权。他说，英国的建议如果被接受，英国政府就可以在种种情况下，通过一个防御和安全委员会来干预新加坡内政。声明说，英国寻求超越一切的权力是新加坡代表团绝对不能接受的，事实上，它把一只手拿出来的东西，又用另一只手收回去了。
    马歇尔还在同一天举行的记者招待会上指出，英国的论点是这样的：只要英国要在新加坡继续保有基地，新加坡人民就不能实行自治。
    马歇尔说，他的代表团愿意作出让步来允许英国继续保有它在新加坡的基地，但是“我们不准备完全屈从”。
    马歇尔表示要在回到新加坡后提出辞职。
