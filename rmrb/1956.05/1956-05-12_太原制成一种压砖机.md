The Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant recently successfully trial-produced the CM-143 high-pressure lever brick press, modeled after a Soviet sample. This machine is specialized equipment used by the refractory materials departments of metallurgical enterprises to manufacture refractory brick blanks using the semi-dry pressing method. It can press 2,400 standard refractory brick blanks per hour. The first such brick press has already been put into production at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, and the second has been supplied to the Tangshan Iron and Steel Plant.

    太原制成一种压砖机
    太原矿山机器厂在不久以前仿照苏联实样试制成功了CM——143高压杠杆压砖机。这种机器是冶金企业耐火材料部用半干燥压榨法制造耐火砖坯的专门设备。它每小时可以压制出标准耐火砖坯二千四百块。第一台这样的压砖机已经在太原钢铁厂投入生产，第二台供给了唐山钢铁厂。
