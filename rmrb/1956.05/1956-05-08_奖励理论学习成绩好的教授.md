    Rewarding Professors with Good Theoretical Study Results
    The spare-time Marxist-Leninist University attached to Northeast Normal University recently commended and rewarded 171 outstanding students. Among the rewarded students, there were fifteen professors and associate professors. Ye Zhisheng, a professor in the Department of Geological Exploration at Northeast Institute of Geology, even took the reference materials printed by the spare-time university with him when he went to meetings in other places, reading them on the train. Sun Xiaoye, a professor in the Chinese Language Department of Northeast Normal University, while diligently studying theory, also worked hard to use materialistic theory to organize and research ancient Chinese. Qu Bingcheng, the director of the Russian Department, is over sixty years old, but he still insists on attending classes and often listens to the Central People's Broadcasting Station's "Political Economy" lectures.

    奖励理论学习成绩好的教授
    东北师范大学附设马克思列宁主义业余大学最近表扬和奖励了171名优秀学员。在受到奖励的学员中有十五名教授和副教授。东北地质学院地勘系业治铮教授，有时到外地去开会还带了业余大学印发的参考资料，在火车上阅读。东北师范大学中国语文系孙晓野教授在认真学习理论的同时，还努力用唯物主义理论整理和研究中国古汉语。俄文系主任曲秉诚教授，年过六十，但仍坚持听课，还经常收听中央人民广播电台的“政治经济学”讲座。
