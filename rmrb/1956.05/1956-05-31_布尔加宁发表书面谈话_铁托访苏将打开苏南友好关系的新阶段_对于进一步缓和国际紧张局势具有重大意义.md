Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 30th: Soviet Premier Bulganin stated that Yugoslav President Tito's upcoming visit to the Soviet Union will be a major event in the history of Soviet-Yugoslav relations. It will open a new stage in the development of friendly relations and all-round cooperation between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.

Bulganin made the statement in a written interview in response to a request from the Moscow correspondent of the Yugoslav News Agency, Chulich. In this statement, which was published on May 29th, Bulganin emphasized the significance of the Soviet-Yugoslav talks held in Belgrade a year ago. He said that the most important result of the Soviet-Yugoslav talks was the restoration of the traditional brotherly friendship between our two socialist countries and between our two peoples. Thanks to the joint efforts of both sides, the measures stipulated in the declaration have been effectively implemented. In the past year, economic and trade relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia have developed and been consolidated. The measures taken by the two governments to implement the provisions of the declaration are in line with the fundamental interests of the Soviet people and the Yugoslav people. Therefore, the people of the two fraternal countries now have every reason to be satisfied with the good relations that have been re-established between our two countries.

Bulganin said: The normalization of Soviet-Yugoslav relations is not only of great significance for cooperation between the two countries, but also has a certain impact on the entire international life.

The Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers pointed out that the relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia are based on Lenin's principles of non-interference in internal affairs and respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries. He then said that the Soviet government notes with satisfaction that Yugoslavia's position on many international issues is consistent with that of the Soviet Union. It can be expected that this consistent position will enable the two countries to consolidate and expand cooperation in international affairs that will help further ease international tensions and consolidate world peace.

Bulganin concluded by saying that Comrade Tito's visit to the Soviet Union will be of great significance for developing and consolidating friendly cooperation between our two countries and for further easing tensions in Europe and other parts of the world.
