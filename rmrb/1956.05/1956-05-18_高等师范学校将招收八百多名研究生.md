    Three schools, Beijing Normal University, East China Normal University, and Northeast Normal University, will enroll over 800 graduate students this year. This number exceeds the total number of graduate students who have graduated from higher normal schools since 1952 by over one hundred.
    The graduate program aims to cultivate teachers for higher normal schools who possess basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism and a dialectical materialist worldview, have systematic professional knowledge, can independently teach one or two courses, and can initially engage in scientific research.
    This year, Beijing Normal University and the other two schools will offer graduate programs in nine categories and twenty-seven specialties, including Chinese Language and Literature, History, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Geography, Education, and Politics, for a two-year study period. Experienced senior professors from each specialty will deliver lectures in these graduate programs. Graduate programs in Russian 19th-century literature and Soviet literature, modern and contemporary world history, zoology, and philosophy will be taught by newly hired Soviet experts.
    The graduate entrance examination will be held on June 9th and 10th. The Ministry of Education has already notified the education departments and bureaus in various regions to select outstanding current graduates of higher normal schools, teaching assistants who have not yet started teaching, outstanding senior high school teachers, and cadres from government agencies and organizations to participate in the examination.

    高等师范学校将招收八百多名研究生
    北京师范大学、华东师范大学、东北师范大学三校今年将招收研究生八百多名。这个数字比1952年以来高等师范学校毕业的各类研究生还要多一百多人。
    研究生班要求培养出具有马克思列宁主义的基础知识和辩证唯物主义的世界观，有系统的专业知识，能够独立担任一门或两门课程的教学，并能够初步从事科学研究的高等师范学校的师资。
    北京师范大学等三个学校今年共开设语文、历史、数学、物理、化学、生物、地理、教育、政治等九类二十七个专业的研究生班，培养二年制的研究生。这些研究生班将由各专业富有教学经验的老教授担任讲课。俄罗斯十九世纪文学及苏维埃文学、世界近代史及现代史、动物学和哲学等四个专业的研究生班将由新聘请的苏联专家来开课。
    研究生考试将在六月九日和十日举行。教育部已经通知各地教育厅、局选拔优秀的高等师范学校本届毕业生、未开课的助教、优秀的高级中学教师和机关、团体的干部等参加考试。
