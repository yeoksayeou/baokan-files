Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 15th: The "Daily Worker" reports from London that Harry Pollitt, Vice-Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain, spoke on the current political situation at the Executive Committee meeting on the 13th, calling on the British labor movement and progressive movement to further strive for the solution of a series of the most important international issues such as disarmament.

Pollitt said that the visit of Bulganin and Khrushchev to Britain, the statement issued after the negotiations between the Soviet leaders and the British government leaders, and Eden's television speech on the results of the negotiations—all these are significant steps towards peaceful coexistence.

Pollitt pointed out, however, that if the labor movement and the progressive movement had used their influence to the greatest extent, more positive results could have been achieved on a series of the most important issues such as disarmament, restrictions on foreign trade, European collective security, and the German question. In this connection, Pollitt condemned the behavior of the Labour Party leaders at the banquet held by the Labour Party National Executive Committee in honor of Bulganin and Khrushchev.

Pollitt accused Western countries of obstructing the conclusion of a disarmament agreement. He emphasized that despite much talk about the economic activities of the North Atlantic Alliance, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization remains a "war machine for nuclear war under American command."

Pollitt finally called on the British working class and all progressive forces to act in unison in the struggle for peace and the vital interests of the working people.

    杜德谈当前政治局势
    号召英工人运动和进步运动争取解决裁军等问题
    新华社布拉格15日电　伦敦消息：“工人日报”报道，英国共产党执行委员会副主席帕姆·杜德十三日在执委会会议上就当前政治局势发言，号召英国工人运动和进步运动进一步争取解决裁军等一系列最重要的国际问题。
    杜德说，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫对英国的访问、在苏联领导人和英国政府领导人谈判以后发布的声明以及艾登就这次谈判结果发表的电视演说——所有这些都是向和平共处迈进的重大步骤。
    杜德指出，然而，如果工人运动和进步运动在最大程度上运用了自己的影响，那末，在像裁军、对外贸易限制、欧洲集体安全和德国问题这样一系列最重要的问题上还可以达成更加积极的结果。谈到这里，杜德谴责了工党领袖们在工党全国执行委员会招待布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫的宴会上的行为。
    杜德指责西方国家阻挠达成裁军协议。他强调指出，尽管对北大西洋联盟在经济方面的活动叫得很厉害，北大西洋公约组织依然是“在美国指挥下进行核子战争的战争机器”。
    杜德最后号召英国工人阶级和一切进步力量在争取和平和劳动人民切身利益的斗争中一致行动。
