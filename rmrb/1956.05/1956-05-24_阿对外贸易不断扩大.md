    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 22nd: Tirana dispatch: Albania's foreign trade relations are constantly expanding. Currently, in addition to conducting trade with the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries, it also maintains trade links with many European and Near Eastern countries such as Italy, Switzerland, Austria, and Lebanon. During the first Five-Year Plan (1951-1955), Albania's total exports more than doubled compared to the first six years after liberation (1945-1950).
    Albania's import and export structure has undergone profound changes. In 1938, before liberation, agricultural and livestock products accounted for 60% of total exports, and there were almost no manufactured goods among the exports. During the first Five-Year Plan, oil, asphalt, other mineral products, and processed timber accounted for 70% of total exports. In addition, industrial manufactured goods such as textiles and cement were also exported. This year, exports of canned fish, fruits, and vegetables will begin.
    On the import side, consumer goods, food, and beverages accounted for more than 83% of total imports in 1938, and there were almost no machines or factory equipment among the imports at that time. During the first Five-Year Plan, imports of machinery and factory equipment accounted for more than 42% of total imports.

    阿对外贸易不断扩大
    新华社布拉格22日电　地拉那消息：阿尔巴尼亚的对外贸易关系在不断地扩大。现在，它除了同苏联和各人民民主国家进行贸易外，还同意大利、瑞士、奥地利、黎巴嫩等欧洲和近东的许多国家保持有贸易联系。在第一个五年计划（1951—1955年）期间，阿尔巴尼亚的出口总额比解放后的最初六年（1945—1950年）增加了一倍多。
    阿尔巴尼亚进出口的结构已经发生了深刻的变化。在解放前的1938年，农产品和畜牧业产品在整个出口中占60％，出口货中几乎没有制成品。在第一个五年计划期间，石油、沥青以及其他矿产品和加工木材占整个出口的70％，另外还输出了纺织品、水泥等工业制成品。今年将开始出口鱼类、水果和蔬菜罐头。
    在进口方面，消费品、食品和饮料等在1938年占整个进口的83％以上，当时进口货中几乎没有机器和工厂设备。在第一个五年计划期间，机器和工厂设备的进口占到整个进口的42％以上。
