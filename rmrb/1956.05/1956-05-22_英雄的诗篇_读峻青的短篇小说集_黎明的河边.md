    A Poem of Heroes
    – Reading Jun Qing’s Collection of Short Stories "Dawn on the Riverbank"
    Li Ye

    The themes of the great War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War once occupied a significantly important position in our literary works. Moreover, it will remain an important part of our creative work for a long, long time. If the recently popular novel "Defend Yan'an" uses a decisive battle on the Northwest battlefield as a broad background of life, then many of Jun Qing's short stories in "Dawn on the Riverbank" unfold heart-stirring struggles against a broader background of life. It has also been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of readers.

    The heroic people of the Jiaodong Plain, like the people of many anti-Japanese base areas in the past, paid a heavy price under the ravages of Japanese invaders, Kuomintang bandit troops, and landlord homecoming corps. However, the unyielding people, in order to strive for a better life, bravely and tenaciously launched struggles and supported the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War. "Dawn on the Riverbank" depicts unforgettable heroic figures in this era and historical significance.

    The characters in the thirteen short stories are all ordinary, yet steadfast and unyielding heroes of the Jiaodong Plain. These characters are not simple models that the author completely took from his own life, but artistic and comprehensive typical examples. The strong atmosphere of life that constitutes the keynote of the work is stirred by the author's infinite and full enthusiasm. The author has rich experience in the cruel struggle life he describes. In many of our works, especially Liu Baiyu's collection of short stories "Firelight Ahead" and Du Pengcheng's novel "Defend Yan'an," they are very good at portraying heroic figures from fierce battles. The author of "Dawn on the Riverbank," in his short story creation, shows a characteristic of being very good at portraying characters' personalities from the real conflicts of struggle life. Many heroic figures in his works, like Xiao Chen and his father in "Dawn on the Riverbank," Xiao Laichun in "Change of Sky," the mother in "The Story on Beacon Hill," and the ten heroes of "Mount Ma Shi," all stand before the readers through sharp struggle plots. The world and all its phenomena are in constant motion and development, and if literary works cannot truly reflect the movement of reality, and cannot reflect the trend of movement and its intensity, they cannot deeply describe the object. This is originally a well-known truth, but some of our authors, although they have also been exposed to the complex struggle of life, due to the restrictive rules of the "no-conflict theory," they dare not pay attention to the real conflicts of real life. Therefore, the works of such writers have become hypocritical works that beautify life, and the character of heroic figures has also lost the basis of real life. The author of "Dawn on the Riverbank," using his profound brushstrokes, boldly outlines the life scenes of cruel struggles: the heroic battles on Mount Ma Shi, the bloody massacres on the banks of the Dawn River and in Zhangjia Village..., the dark rule of the landlord homecoming corps, and the shocking massacre in Jishan Village, dripping with blood, are shocking. The cruel and狰狞 faces of the enemy are so vivid and lifelike. However, these bloody scenes of life do not demean the nobility and greatness of the heroic characters. On the contrary, it is precisely in this contrast of bright colors that those ordinary heroes shine brightly in the flames, becoming tempered steel. We will never forget Xiao Chen and his family in "Dawn on the Riverbank." In order to lead our cadres through the enemy-occupied areas and across the river to lead the armed work team, Xiao Chen, still a child, bravely blocked the enemy, watched his mother and younger brother captured and killed, and finally embraced the enemy with his wounded body and rolled into the river to die together with the enemy. His elderly father, in the case of the tragic death of his wife and children and his own injuries, still holding back his tears and enduring the pain, parted the heavy waves and sent the cadres who were related to the struggle on the other side of the river. We will not forget the ten people's soldiers buried on Mount Ma Shi, who, in order to rescue the masses from the dangerous situation of being surrounded by the enemy, repeatedly covered the masses' breakout, and finally died heroically on Mount Ma Shi. Similarly, we will not forget those heroes who stood firm under the dark clouds, the bloody smell, and the rule of the landlord homecoming bandits. Xiao Laichun in "Change of Sky," burning with the fire of revenge, traveled back and forth among the enemy beasts, collecting intelligence and delivering messages, like a brave petrel. The image of the great mother in "The Story on Beacon Hill" who suffered severe torture and refused to reveal where her comrades were hiding, is one of countless steadfast mothers in China. …

    Even in the six short stories in the first collection that describe real life, the author widely describes the influence of past struggles on people's thoughts and feelings. By linking today's reality with the picture of cruel struggles in the war years, using real and vivid contrasting life scenes, it shows that today's vigorous and beautiful life is directly related to the glorious struggle life. Just as the author said in the "Postscript": "War has given people many valuable lessons, so that they can understand the world more deeply and meticulously, and treat life more purely and nobly. And the sacrificed heroes will always live in the hearts of the people, and encourage them to establish new merits in new life."

    Old Water Buffalo Grandpa, who was so poor all his life that he couldn't even marry a wife, was lonely and only had a dog to keep him company, but the Communist Party changed his life's destiny. He understood that people are not just living for themselves, and that a real person is "born for everyone, dies for everyone." He cared more about others than himself, and he "buried his head silently all day to work for everyone." In the torrential flood of the big river, in order to protect the safety of countless people's lives and property on both sides of the river, he disregarded everything and used his own body to block the gap in the river embankment that had been breached. He sacrificed himself, but just like the old pear tree that the author described with poetic symbolism, it used its thick trunk and pavilion-like branches and leaves to protect the safety of the soldiers, and also protected the safety of the many small trees growing around it. Now, these small trees that have been protected by it are growing vigorously. Old Water Buffalo Grandpa died, and the people missed him. Xiao Bao, who was spared from the flood disaster under his cover, also missed him. People said he did not die. In the past days of blood and tears, the people who shed blood, shed tears, fought, and suffered serious hardship, understood the happiness of the new life more and more, and therefore cherished it more. The old traffic officer, who lost his warm family and health for the revolution, was unwilling to mention his misfortune, and poured all his enthusiasm into his current postal work. He was humble, amiable, "always smiling, never angry," but when he heard someone say that postal work was a "losing business," it aroused his anger. How did the cruel struggle life nurture Xiao Mei, who lost her parents, and make her merge with the people from a young age, fighting against the people's thieves regardless of her life.

    "Dawn on the Riverbank" is shining with crystal clear light precisely because it is a poem filled with struggle life. Although some chapters are still rough in art, and the materials from life still lack higher refinement and processing, the intense and real struggles make you feel that its content is solid and full of vitality. We love such works, and we need more works that boldly depict the real struggles in life.

    英雄的诗篇
    ——读峻青的短篇小说集“黎明的河边”
    李叶
    伟大的抗日战争和人民解放战争的题材，曾经在我们的文学作品里，占据过一个相当重要的位置。而且，它还会很久很久成为我们创作中重要题材的一部分。如果说近年来在群众中受到热烈欢迎的长篇小说“保卫延安”，是以西北战场上一个决定性的战役作为广阔的生活背景，那么，峻青的“黎明的河边”的许多短篇，却是从更广阔的生活背景上，展开了动人心魄的斗争。它在广大读者中，同样受到了热烈的欢迎。
    胶东平原上的英雄人民，像过去许多抗日根据地的人民一样，曾经在日本侵略者、国民党匪军、地主还乡团的蹂躏下，付出过惨重的代价。但是，不屈的人民，为了争取美好的生活，英勇顽强地展开斗争，支持了抗日战争和人民解放战争的胜利。“黎明的河边”，正是在这样的时代和历史意义上，描绘了使人难忘的英雄人物。
    十三个短篇里的人物，都是胶东平原上的普通的，然而却是坚贞不屈、百折不挠的英雄。这些人物不是作者完全从自己的生活里取下来的简单模型，而是艺术的综合典型，构成作品基调的强烈的生活气息，激荡着作者无限的饱满热情。作者对于他所描写的残酷的斗争生活，有着丰富的体验。在我们的许多作品里，尤其是刘白羽的短篇集“火光在前”，杜鹏程的长篇“保卫延安”，都非常善于从激烈的战斗中刻划英雄人物。“黎明的河边”的作者，在他的短篇创作中所显示出来的特色，是非常善于从斗争生活的真实冲突中，刻划人物性格。他的作品中的许多英雄人物形象，像“黎明的河边”中的小陈和他的父亲，“变天”中的小来春，“烽火山上的故事”里的母亲，“马石山上”的十个英雄，都是通过尖锐的斗争情节，屹立在读者面前的。世界和它的一切现象，都是处于不断的运动和发展中，而文学作品如果不能真实地反映现实的运动，不能反映运动发展的趋向和它的强度，就不能够深刻地描写对象。这本来是人所熟知的真理，但是，我们有些作者，虽然也接触过复杂斗争的生活面，却由于“无冲突论”思想的清规戒律，使他们不敢注视现实生活的真实冲突。因而，这样作家的作品，成了粉饰生活的虚伪的作品，英雄人物的性格也丧失了生活真实的基础。“黎明的河边”的作者，运用他的深刻的笔触，大胆地勾画出残酷斗争的生活画面，马石山上的壮烈的战斗，黎明河边、张家庄……血腥屠杀的场面，地主还乡团暗无天日的统治，积善庄骇人听闻的惨案，鲜血淋淋，触目惊心。敌人残酷狰狞的面目这样鲜明，生动。但是，这些充满着血腥的生活场景，并没有贬低英雄性格的崇高和伟大。相反，却正是在这种鲜明色彩的对比描写中，照耀出那些平凡的英雄，在火焰里，百炼成钢，放射出夺目的光彩。我们将永远不会忘记，“黎明的河边”里的小陈和他的一家人。他们为了带领我们的干部通过敌占区，渡河去领导武工队，还是小孩子的小陈，英勇地阻击敌人，亲眼看着被人捕去的母亲、弟弟被杀害，最后自己带着受伤的身体抱住敌人滚到河里去和敌人同归于尽。他的年老的父亲，在妻、子惨死，自己受伤的情况下，依然噙着泪，忍着痛，分开重重的波浪，把关系着对岸斗争的干部送过河去。我们不会忘记埋葬在马石山上的十位人民战士，他们为了将群众从敌人重重包围的险境里解救出来，几次掩护群众突围，最后壮烈地牺牲在马石山上。同样的，我们也不会忘记那些在乌云密布、血腥冲鼻、地主还乡团匪徒们统治下屹立着的英雄们。“变天”中的小来春，燃烧着复仇的火来往在敌人野兽群里，收集情报，传递消息，像一只勇敢的海燕。“烽火山上的故事”里那个受尽酷刑拷打，始终不肯供出自己的同志躲在那里的伟大母亲的形象，是中国无数坚贞不屈的母亲中的一个。……
    即使在集子第一辑的描写现实生活的六个短篇里，作者也广泛地描写了过去斗争生活所给予人们思想感情上的影响。把今天的现实和战争年代残酷斗争生活的图景联系起来，用真实的鲜明对照的生活场景，表明今天蓬蓬勃勃的美好生活和光荣的斗争生活有着直接的关联。正像作者在“后记”中所说的：“战争给了人们许多宝贵的教训，使他们更深刻更细致地去认识世界，更纯洁更高尚地去对待生活。而牺牲了的英雄们，也永远地活在人民的心里，并鼓舞他们，在新的生活中去树立新的功勋。”
    穷了一辈子连老婆也娶不起的老水牛爷爷，一个人孤苦伶仃，只有一条狗给他作伴，但是，共产党改变了他的生活命运，他懂得了人不只是为自己活着的人，真正的人是“生为大家生，死为大家死”。他对别人比对自己更关心，他“整天价不说不道地埋着头给大家干活”。在洪水暴涨的大河里，为了保住两岸无数人民生命财产的安全，他不顾一切地用自己的身体堵塞住了河堤被冲开的漏洞。他牺牲了，但是，正像作者用诗意的象征描写的那棵老梨树一样，用它那粗壮的躯体，亭子盖似的枝叶，保护了战士的安全，也保护了生长在它周围的许多小树的安全。现在，被它保护下来的这些小树，都在蓬勃地生长。老水牛爷爷死了，人民怀念着他，在他的掩护下，免于洪水灾难的小宝也在怀念他，人们都说他没有死。在过去血泪的日子里，流过血，流过泪，战斗过，遭受过严重苦难的人们，便越懂得新生活的幸福，因此便越珍贵它。为了革命，失去了温暖的家庭和身体健康的老交通，不愿意提起自己的不幸，把全部热情贯注在现在的邮政工作里。他谦虚，和蔼，“总是笑眯眯地，从来不会发脾气”，但当他听到有人说邮政工作是“熊买卖”的时候，却激起了他的怒火。残酷的斗争生活又是怎样地哺育了牺牲了父母的小美，使她从小就和人民融成一体，不顾性命地和人民盗贼展开了斗争。
    “黎明的河边”正是因为以这种充满了斗争生活的诗篇，闪烁着晶莹的光采。尽管某些篇章艺术上还显得粗糙，它的来自生活的素材还缺乏更高地提炼和加工，但是，剧烈的真实的斗争，使你感到它的内容坚实，充满活力。我们喜爱这样的作品，我们需要这样大胆描写生活中的真实斗争的作品更多地出现。
