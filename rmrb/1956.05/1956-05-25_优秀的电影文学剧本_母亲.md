    Excellent Film Literary Script "Mother"
    Yuán Wénshū
    Author: Hai Mo, published by China Youth Publishing House

    Hai Mo's "Mother" is one of the excellent film scripts produced recently. Through the growth of an ordinary woman, it generally reflects almost an entire historical period—the Chinese New Democratic Revolution. The period of the New Democratic Revolution was a rich and colorful period in Chinese history. To reflect this complex and ever-changing historical era in a short five or six thousand words or in an hour and a half of screening time requires tremendous artistic generalization ability. When dealing with this complex and vast subject matter, the author closely grasped a basic starting point: to reflect various historical events through the activities of the characters in the work, especially the main character, Mother. The author's brushstrokes have always focused on the mother's fate and experiences. Although there are many major and exciting historical events in the era depicted in the work, the author's attention has not been distracted. Instead, these major historical events merely constitute the environment and background of the characters' activities. When they are not closely related to the main characters' activities, they are cleverly omitted. On the other hand, the author did not treat the characters as labels and footnotes of historical events, nor did they describe the characters in isolation from the specific historical environment. The characters and historical background are closely integrated. The correct path taken by the author in terms of creative methods laid the foundation for the achievement of the work and the establishment of the character image of the mother.

    The achievement of "Mother" lies first in its relatively successful portrayal of the main character in the work—the image of the mother. The work describes how the mother grew from an ordinary rural woman into a resolute proletarian fighter. She nurtured her children for the revolution, and she dedicated her entire life to the revolutionary cause without reservation. Her fate is closely linked to the fate of the revolution and the working class. The arduous and tortuous path she has traveled is the path taken by thousands of older generation revolutionary women in our country.

    One of the characteristics of the characterization of the mother in the work is that the mother is always in the midst of sharp and complex struggles, and her character is revealed in a series of tortuous and dramatic conflicts. Starting with the escape from famine, followed by the death of her husband Liang Yuhou, the sacrifice of revolutionary worker Deng Fei, and the arrest of her eldest son Chengwen... until she was interrogated by special agents on the eve of liberation, the mother was always acting and fighting. The author is good at finding the moments when the protagonist's character is most vividly expressed in various periods and environments to be depicted.

    The play opens with the mother's family adopting an abandoned little girl, Xique (Magpie), while fleeing from famine. When the mother first hears the little girl crying, although she cannot bear to walk by indifferently, because her family's burden cannot be increased by a new burden, she can only pick up the little girl and pat her the first time, wipe away her tears with her hand, and the second time they can only give her half of the last piece of dry food. It was not until the third time that the mother resolutely adopted the little girl. In this scene, the characters only say one sentence, but it has very rich subtext. The characters' inner activities are rich, and maternal love and fear of the pressure of future life are in fierce conflict. Finally, maternal love overcomes the pressure of life, and the mother adopts the little girl. At this time, the kind side of the mother's character is also fully displayed. From the perspective of expression, this scene makes good use of the unique means of film art, and the characters' inner fluctuations and changes are expressed in characteristic and expressive external actions.

    For example, in a scene in Section 10, the work describes the mother waiting for the person sent by the Party to make contact:

    Mother: "Xique, listen, is there anyone outside?"

    Xique listened at the door and came back complaining: "Mom, what's wrong with you these days?"

    "Remember, tell me as soon as there is any movement at the door!"

    "You've said it a hundred times!"

    These few concise dialogues vividly illustrate the mother's anxious mood. Although no one came, she always felt like someone was there. The emergence of this illusion is obviously due to her excessive eagerness to expect it.

    Then someone knocked on the door, and it was Dong Yaofen, who had become a traitor but the mother did not know. At this time, the mother's mood was confused and distressed: Deng Fei was sacrificed, Chengwen was in prison, the person to make contact had not come, but Dong Yaofen, whose behavior was suspicious, appeared. This emotion of the mother is easily vented on the child. When she saw her youngest son Chengwu mixing flour of unknown origin, the mother slapped him hard. But when she realized that the child was not at fault, she had to put her face against the place where he had just been beaten... In this short scene, the mother's eager pursuit of the Party, her wit, her love for her children, her difficult situation, and her complex and rapidly changing mood are expressed delicately and sincerely. Although separated from the Party and comrades, the mother felt isolated and helpless, but she was full of hope and confidence for the future. "Alas! Grow up quickly!" The mother's last sentence to her children in this section profoundly and generally expresses her mood at the time.

    "Mother" is through such vivid plots and dramatic scenes that leaves us with a relatively clear impression of a working-class mother.

    Another feature of "Mother" is its originality in creative style. The author truly drew materials from life and processed these materials in his own way. The theme of "Mother" is novel, and the characters, plots, and details are all original. Most chapters of "Mother" can show us fresh pictures of life. Here, we rarely see things that have been repeated and appeared in other works. Taking the revolutionary worker Yan Jia's four attempts to make contact as an example, each time the environment, conditions, and methods are different from similar plots in other works and also different from each other, so each contact constitutes a novel, interesting, and characteristic dramatic scene. Even in some details, we can see the author's efforts. For example, Yan Jia's password for the first contact with Chengwen is: "Excuse me, is Yang Xiaolou's show on today?" We know that Yang Xiaolou was a well-known Peking Opera actor in the 1920s. This password is both novel and timely, and adds a sense of the times to the work.

    Originality is the soul of creation. Formulaic works lack originality. The author's efforts in this regard have basically enabled "Mother" to avoid the pit of formulaism that is currently seriously endangering our creation.

    The work "Mother" also has many shortcomings, the most important of which is that the image of the mother is not full enough. I think the key problem that causes this shortcoming is that the development process of the mother's character has been simplified.

    In the prologue, we can see that the mother is very kind. She adopted Xique in the most difficult circumstances; and her act of sheltering Deng Fei is a further development of this kind character. But at that time, the mother could not understand Deng Fei and his activities. In the mother's eyes, Deng Fei was just a troublemaking young man. As a poor working people, the mother's kindness contains elements of class feelings, but this is still a spontaneous and vague thing, and there is still a long way to go before true class consciousness.

    Immediately following is the situation six years later. At this time, the mother is even more caring for Deng Fei; in order to prevent Deng Fei from being hungry, she gave him the last two yams left for her children to eat; when Deng Fei and his comrades were holding a meeting in the house, she kept watch at the door. She even knew that Chengwen was engaged in a very dangerous activity with Deng Fei, but she did not stop it. These facts show that the mother is not only a generally kind working woman, but a revolutionary sympathizer and active participant with considerable awareness. But what kind of struggle did the mother go through this long way? The work does not make a positive description but lets it complete behind the scenes. In the first part of the work, the mother's character has been basically completed through the test of the mother by things such as the death of Liang Yuhou, joining the Party, the sacrifice of Deng Fei, and the arrest of Chengwen. In the second and third parts, although the mother has encountered a series of difficulties and tests, these have also enriched the mother's character, but these struggles are external after all, and the mother's inner state has not developed significantly. In this way, the process of the mother growing into a proletarian fighter seems relatively simple. According to the requirements of the theme task of the work, this development process should be described positively and meticulously. The author ignored this point, so that the character of the mother cannot leave a deeper impression on people.

    Another shortcoming of the script is that it is too long. The length mentioned here does not mainly refer to the number of words in the literary script, but to the excessive dialogue and scene changes in the work. The author did not use the concise and expressive means listed above in all scenes. For example, the death of Liang Yuhou and the mother joining the Party are mainly unfolded through dialogue. These dialogues lack strong expressiveness, and will take up a lot of film footage in future films. In fact, due to the excessive length of the script, it has already caused some difficulties for the filming work.

    The film "Mother" has already begun filming. We hope that through the collective creation of the director, actors and other filming staff, it can be improved on the basis of the literary script, so that we can see a fuller image of the heroic mother on the screen in the future.

    优秀的电影文学剧本“母亲”
    袁文殊
    作者：海默　中国青年出版社出版
    海默的“母亲”是最近产生的优秀电影剧本之一。它通过一个普通妇女的成长，概括地反映了几乎一整段历史年代——中国新民主主义革命时期的革命活动。新民主主义革命时期是中国历史上丰富多采的一个时期，要在短短的五六万字的篇幅或者是在一个半小时的放映时间里，反映这个复杂而变化多端的历史年代，是需要巨大的艺术概括能力的。作者在处理这一纷纭庞杂的题材的时候，紧紧地把握住了一个基本的出发点：通过作品中的人物，特别是作品中的主要人物——母亲的活动来反映各个不同的历史事件。作者的笔触始终专注在母亲的命运和遭遇上。虽然在作品所表现的时代里，有着很多重大的激动人心的历史事件，但作者的注意力却没有被迷惑。而仅仅使这些重大的历史事件构成人物活动的环境和后景，当它们与主要人物活动没有多大关联的时候，就被巧妙地省略过去了。另一方面，作者也没有将人物作为历史事件的标签和注脚，或者孤立地脱离具体的历史环境来描写人物。人物和历史背景是紧密地结合在一起的。作者在创作方法上所走的这一正确途径，给作品的成就和母亲这个人物形象的树立奠定了基础。
    “母亲”的成就首先在于它比较成功地塑造了作品中的主要人物——母亲的形象。作品描写了母亲如何从一个普通的农村妇女，成长为一个坚决的无产阶级的战士。她为革命哺育了自己的儿女，她自己的一生也毫无保留地贡献给了革命事业。她的命运是与革命和工人阶级的命运紧紧结合在一起的，她走过的艰苦而曲折的道路，正是我国千百个老一辈革命妇女所走过的道路。
    作品在母亲这个人物的塑造上的一个特点，是母亲始终处在尖锐复杂的斗争当中，她的性格是在一系列曲折而富有戏剧性冲突的情节中揭示出来的。从逃荒开始，接着是丈夫梁遇厚的死亡、革命工作者邓非的牺牲以及大儿子承文的被捕……一直到解放前夕自己被特务拷问为止，母亲始终在行动着、战斗着。作者善于从各个不同的时期和环境里，找到主人公性格表现得最鲜明的时机来加以刻划。
    剧本的开场是母亲一家在逃荒途中收养了一个被遗弃的小女孩喜鹊。当母亲最初听到小女孩的哭声的时候，虽然她不忍熟视无睹地走过去，但是由于自己一家人的生活重担上不能再加上新的负担了，因此她第一次只能将小女孩抱起来拍了拍，用手抹去她的眼泪，第二次他们也只能分一半最后的一块干粮给她，一直到第三次母亲才毅然将小女孩收养下来。这场戏里人物只说了一句话，却有着非常丰富的潜台词。整场戏里人物内心的活动是丰富的，母爱和对未来生活压力的恐惧在激烈的冲突着，最后母爱终于战胜了生活的压力，母亲把小女孩收养下来了，这时候，母亲性格的善良一面也充分显示了出来。从表现形式来看，这场戏很好地运用了电影艺术所特有的手段，人物的内心波动和变化，都以富有特征性和表现力的外形动作表达了出来。
    再如在第十节的一场戏里，作品对母亲等待着党派来的接关系的人的描写是这样的：
    母亲：“喜鹊，你听听，是不是有人在外头？”
    喜鹊到门边听了听，埋怨地走回来：“妈，你这几天是怎么啦？”
    “记住，门口一有动静就告诉我！”
    “你说了有一百遍啦！”
    这几句简练的对话很生动的说明了母亲焦急的心情。虽然并没有人来，但是她老感觉着有人似的，这种错觉的产生显然是由于她的期待过于殷切的缘故。
    接着有人敲门了，进来的是已经当了叛徒而母亲还不知道的董尧芬。这时候，母亲的心情是迷惘而愁苦的：邓非牺牲了，承文在监牢里，接关系的人没有来，反而出现一个形迹可疑的董尧芬。母亲的这种情绪便很容易迁怒在孩子身上，当她看到小儿子承武在和着来历不明的面粉的时候，母亲狠狠地揍了他一巴掌。但一了解到孩子并没有什么过错的时候，她只好用脸贴着他刚才被打过的那块地方……在这篇幅不长的一场戏里，母亲对党的急切的追求、她的机智、她对孩子的爱，她的困难的处境和复杂而急剧变化着的心情被表现得细致而真切。虽然离开了党和同志，母亲感到孤立无援，但对未来却又充满着希望和信心。“唉！你们快点长大吧！”母亲在这一节中最后对孩子们讲的这句话，深刻而概括地表露了她当时的心情。
    “母亲”就是通过这样的一些生动的情节和富于戏剧性的场面，给我们留下了一个比较鲜明的工人阶级的母亲的印象。
    “母亲”的另一个特色是它在创作风格上的独创性。作者是真正从生活中汲取了素材，并以自己的方法来处理这些素材的。“母亲”的题材是新颖的，人物、情节和细节描写都是富有独创性的。“母亲”的大部分章节都能给我们展示出一幅幅新鲜的生活画面，在这里我们很少见到重复的已经出现在其它作品中的东西。以革命工作者颜佳四次接关系为例，每一次的环境、条件、方式既区别于其他作品中类似情节而又彼此有所不同，因而每一次的接关系都构成了新颖有趣和富有特征性的戏剧场面。即使在一些细节上，也看得出作者所作的努力。例如颜佳第一次和承文接头的暗号是：“劳驾，请问今天有杨小楼的戏没有？”我们知道杨小楼是二十年代尽人皆知的名京剧演员，这一暗号既新颖适时，又给作品增添了时代色彩。
    独创性是创作的灵魂。公式主义的作品是缺乏独创性的。而作者在这方面所作的努力，却基本上使“母亲”避开了目前严重危害着我们创作的公式主义的泥坑。
    “母亲”这部作品也还有不少的缺陷，其中最主要的就是母亲的形象还不够丰满。我以为产生这一缺点的关键问题是由于母亲性格的发展过程被简单化了的缘故。
    在序场中，我们就可以看出母亲是非常善良的。她在最艰苦的情况下收养了喜鹊；而她掩护邓非的行动，就是这种善良性格的进一步的发展。但是母亲当时还不能理解邓非和他所从事的活动，在母亲的眼里，邓非还只是个爱惹事的年青人。作为一个贫苦的劳动人民，母亲的善良是包含着阶级感情的因素的，但这还是一种自发的、模糊不清的东西，同真正的阶级觉悟还有一段很长的距离。
    紧接着是六年以后的情形，这时候母亲对邓非更是关怀备至了；为了怕饿着邓非，她把留给儿女们的最后两块山药拿给他吃；当邓非和他的同志们在屋里开会的时候，她在门口望风。甚至她明知道承文同邓非在一起从事一种非常危险的活动，也不加以制止。这些事实说明母亲已经不仅是一般善良的劳动妇女，而是一个具有相当觉悟的革命同情者和积极参与者了。但是这一长段的路程母亲是通过什么样的斗争走过来的呢，作品中却没有作正面描写而让它在幕后完成了。作品中的母亲在第一次出场的时候和邓非、承文等人在思想上就没有什么矛盾和分歧，而只有觉悟程度上的高低的差别。因此在作品的第一部里，通过梁遇厚的死难、入党、邓非的牺牲、承文的被捕等事情对母亲的考验，母亲的性格已经基本上完成了。在第二部和第三部里，母亲虽然又遭到一系列的困难和考验，而这些对母亲的性格虽也有所丰富，但这些斗争毕竟都是外在的，母亲内在的精神状态就没有什么显著的发展了。这样，母亲成长为一个无产阶级战士的过程就显得比较简单。而按照作品的主题任务的要求，这一发展过程是应该作正面的、细致的描写的。作者忽略了这一点，因而使母亲这个人物不能给人留下更深刻的印象。
    剧本的另一个缺点是篇幅过长了一些。这里所说的篇幅过长主要并不是指文学剧本字数的多少，而是指作品中的过多的对话和场景的变换。作者并不是在所有的场面里都运用了上面所列举过的那种简练而富有表现力的手段的。例如梁遇厚的死难以及母亲入党等情节，主要都是借助于对话来展开的。这些对话既缺乏强烈的表现力，在未来的影片中又要占据很多的胶片。实际上由于剧本篇幅过长，已经给摄制工作造成了一些困难。
    影片“母亲”已经开始摄制了。我们希望经过导演、演员及其他摄制工作人员的集体创作，能在文学剧本的基础上提高一步，让我们将来在银幕上能够看到一个更丰满的英雄母亲的形象。
