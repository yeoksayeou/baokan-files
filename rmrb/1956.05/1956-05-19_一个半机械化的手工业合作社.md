    A Semi-Mechanized Handicraft Cooperative
    Xiao Yan, Bao Yi
    The Weifang City First Red Furnace Production Cooperative in Shandong Province was established in October 1951. In the beginning, it only had simple blacksmithing tools such as furnaces for forging, hammers, tongs, and bellows. Over the past few years, they have utilized the collective wisdom and strength, diligently managed the cooperative, and production has grown daily. Before merging with the Red Furnace Third Cooperative, the number of members had grown from the original 72 to 334, with over 200,000 yuan in capital accumulation. The products have also increased from dozens to over two hundred varieties, and the sales scope has expanded to Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Jiangsu, and Heilongjiang provinces. Due to the gradual addition of many machines, the value of machine-produced goods now accounts for more than 90% of the cooperative's total output value, developing from a general handicraft production cooperative into a semi-mechanized farm tool factory.
    It has not been easy for this handicraft cooperative to reach its current scale. Take the purchase of machinery, for example. In the autumn of 1952, Tan Peiyuan, the deputy director of the cooperative, visited a materials exchange fair in Jinan and saw a power press for iron. The iron shovels pressed by this machine were flat and smooth, of good quality, low price, and high work efficiency. However, when he returned and proposed buying the machine to the members, some members raised a lot of questions, such as: "If we buy the machine, what if we don't have the technology to master it?" "What if we can't sell the large quantities of products we make?" "Where will we get the money to buy the machine?" The cooperative's board of directors carefully studied this issue and determined that the machine should be bought, the difficulties could be overcome, and there would be no problem with product sales. The money to buy the machine could be accumulated by improving production. After discussion at the members' meeting, everyone agreed, so it was decided to buy a power hammer first and then an iron press.
    After the machine was bought, many technical difficulties were encountered. When the workers started the power hammer, it was either too light or too heavy; the hammer operator and the tong operator also didn't coordinate well. No one could use the iron press either. People were sent outside to learn operating knowledge in a hurry, but they still couldn't master it. Once, they worked for four days and reworked for three, with losses reaching more than 200 yuan. Some people said, "The iron press bought by the cooperative has simply become a 'big tiger,' and if we can't tame it, it will 'eat' up this cooperative in a few months." But the members were not intimidated by the difficulties. They selected more than ten young workers to fully study the technology. After about a year, these blacksmiths who had previously only operated tongs or swung large hammers on small red furnaces were able to master all the technology of power hammers and iron presses. Power hammers and iron presses have demonstrated their superiority in production. The daily output of large hoes produced by power hammers increased from the initial seven or eight to forty-five. The iron press also increased from initially pressing more than one hundred iron shovels per day to more than nine hundred. The scraps of steel that were difficult to forge with a batch of small red furnaces accumulated over the years were also all made into products using power hammers.
    As the needs of production development grew, the cooperative successively added many machines. By 1954, they used the accumulated funds and state loans to buy some lathes. Plus, when the cooperative expanded, some new members brought in some machines. The cooperative became a semi-mechanized production cooperative. Using machine production, they can accept large orders and undertake the production of steel products that cannot be done by hand.
    Seeing that production had developed, the members further brought into play their enthusiasm for work and creativity. Recently, they successfully trial-produced a horse-drawn (also hand-cranked) chaff cutter. This machine can chop more than 300 catties of grain straw per hour on average with only one person and one animal operating it. Technician Zhang Huanting also successfully imitated an electric shear. With just a step on the foot pedal, the iron plates cut by the machine are much more uniform in quality than those cut by dozens of hammer blows manually. The machine tool workshop has also implemented the method of masters leading apprentices, actively cultivating and training a group of young technicians, and has also opened amateur technical training classes.
    With the development of production, the lives of the members are also gradually improving. The blacksmith's tragic life of "half a year of coarse grains and vegetables, and sleeping with nothing but torn sacks" in the old society has gone forever. The members sing in a self-composed clapper talk that today's life is: "Eating wheat noodles, drinking rice porridge, and everyone has new pants and new padded jackets..." There is an entertainment room, a basketball court, and a nursery for female members.
    After the complete cooperativization of Weifang City's handicrafts industry, it merged with the Red Furnace Third Cooperative. The number of members increased from the original 300 to 519. Thirteen new lathes were added, and spacious factory buildings were built. After the Spring Festival, good news that made everyone excited spread throughout the cooperative - with the approval of the higher authorities, they will produce double-wheel double-furrow plows this year. The preliminary annual production task is 15,000 plows and 600,000 parts. All members of the cooperative feel very honored to be able to support the farmer brothers in realizing agricultural cooperation. Now, the entire cooperative is brewing a labor competition to complete the plan ahead of schedule.

    一个半机械化的手工业合作社
    萧彦　保义
    山东省潍坊市第一红炉生产合作社，是在1951年10月建立起来的。开始的时候，只有打铁用的炉子、铁锤、铁钳子、风箱等简单的打铁工具。几年来，他们发挥了集体的智慧和力量，勤俭办社，生产日益发展。在没有和红炉三社合并以前社员已经由原来的72人发展到334人，有了二十多万元的资金积累。产品也由几十种增加到二百种以上，销售范围扩大到山西、陕西、河南、江苏以及黑龙江等省。由于逐步增添了不少机器，目前，机器生产的产值已经占全社总产值的90％以上，由一个一般的手工业生产合作社发展成为半机械化的农具工厂了。
    这个手工业合作社能有今天这样的规模是不容易的。就拿添购机器来说吧，1952年秋天，合作社副主任谭培元到济南参观物资交流会，看到一种电力压铁机。用这种机器压的铁铣又平整又光滑，质量好，价格低，工作效率高。可是当他回来向社员提出买机器的时候，有些社员提出一大堆问题。如：“机器买来，没技术，掌握不了怎么办？”“大量制造出来的东西卖不出去怎么办？”“买机器的钱从哪里来？”在社的理事会上，认真研究了这个问题，确定机器要买，困难可以克服，产品销路也没问题，买机器的钱可以依靠搞好生产积累。经过社员大会的讨论，大家都同意了，于是确定先买电锤，后买压铁机。
    机器买来之后，技术上又遇到了很多困难。工人开起电锤来，不是太轻就是太重；掌锤的和掌钳的也配合不好。压铁机也没人能使，派人到外边去匆匆忙忙学操纵知识，还是掌握不好。有一次干了四天活，返工了三天，损失达二百多元。有人说：“社里买来的压铁机，简直变成了‘大老虎’了，擒不了它，几个月就会把这个社‘吃’光的。”但是社员们并没有被困难吓倒。他们选拔了十多个青年工人全力学习技术。经过一年左右时间，这些过去只会在小红炉上掌钳或抡大锤的铁工，已经能掌握电锤、压铁机的全部技术了。电锤和压铁机在生产中，都显示了它们的优越性。电锤生产大镐日产量由最初七、八个提高到四十五个。压铁机也由最初每天压铁铣一百多张增加到九百多张。几年来积累起来的一批小红炉难以锻造的零碎钢铁，也用电锤全部做成了产品。
    随着生产发展的需要，社内又陆续添置了不少机器。到1954年，就用过去积累的资金和国家贷款，买了一些车床，加上扩社的时候部分新社员带进一些机器，这个社就变为一个半机械化生产的合作社了。使用机器生产，就可以接受大批订货，并且能承做手工操作做不了的钢质产品。
    社员们看到生产发展了，更加发挥了劳动积极性和创造性。最近他们试制成功了一种马拉（也能手摇）铡草机。这种机器只要由一个人和一头牲口操作，平均每小时就能铡三百多斤谷草。技工张焕亭又仿造成功了一种电剪，只要脚一踏，机器裁下的铁板，比人工敲打几十大锤裁下的质量要整齐得多。机床车间又实行了师傅带徒弟的办法，积极培养和训练了一批青年技工，而且开办了业余技术训练班。
    随着生产的发展，社员的生活也在逐步改善着。旧社会铁匠的“半年糠菜半年粮，睡觉离不了破麻袋”的悲惨生活已经一去不复返了。社员在自编的快板中歌颂如今的生活是：“吃到了麦子面，喝到了大米粥，新裤新袄人人有……”社内有娱乐室、有篮球场，还为女社员办了托儿所。
    潍坊市手工业全部合作化后，又同红炉三社合并了，社员由原来三百多人增加到519人，新添了十三部车床，新建了宽敞的厂房。春节后，一个使大家欢欣鼓舞的好消息在全社传开了——经过上级批准，他们今年就要生产双轮双铧犁了，初步拟订的全年生产任务是一万五千部，零件六十万部。全社社员都为能支援农民兄弟实现农业合作化感到非常光荣。现在，全社正在酝酿开展提前完成计划的劳动竞赛。
