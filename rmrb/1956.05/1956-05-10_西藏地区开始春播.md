    Spring planting has begun in the Tibetan region.
    The fields in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River and on both banks of the Nyang Chu River in the Tibetan region have been plowed once or twice and spread with manure. Farmers are diverting river water into a network of canals, and busy spring plowing and planting has begun.
    In the past few days, various villages have carried out activities to celebrate and wish for a good harvest. Farmers bring Hada scarves and highland barley wine to relatives and friends to congratulate them. Some villages erect flower tents in the fields, and men and women farmers participate in lively circle dances. The climate is particularly warm this year on both banks of the Nyang Chu River, which had a bumper harvest last year. Farmers say that this is a sign of a good year.
    Agricultural loan groups dispatched by the People's Bank of China's Xigaze Branch and Gyangze Branch have distributed highland barley and wheat seeds to farmers. Some farmers on both banks of the Nyang Chu River also received plowing cattle distributed free of charge by the State Council before the spring plowing. Medical personnel and livestock epidemic prevention personnel dispatched by the Xigaze City People's Hospital and the Livestock Clinic are traveling in the middle and upper reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River for treatment.

    西藏地区开始春播
    西藏地区雅鲁藏布江中游和年楚河两岸的田地，已经翻耕一遍到两遍，并且撒上了粪肥，农民们正在把江水引入蛛网般的渠道里，繁忙的春耕播种开始了。
    这几天，各个村庄都进行了预祝丰收的活动。农民们带着哈达和青稞酒到亲友家去祝贺，有些村庄在田间搭起花帐篷，男女农民参加热闹的圆圈舞会。去年获得大丰收的年楚河两岸，今年气候特别暖和，最近落了几场春雨，农民们说这是大好年景的预兆。
    人民银行日喀则支行和江孜支行派出的农贷组，已经把青稞和小麦的种子发给了农民。年楚河两岸的部分农民，在春耕前还得到了国务院无偿发放的耕牛。日喀则市人民医院和家畜诊疗所派出的医务人员和兽疫防治人员，正在雅鲁藏布江中、上游地区巡回治疗。  （新华社）
