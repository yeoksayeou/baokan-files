　　Recently, on the back river of the Capital Laboring People's Cultural Palace, which is rippling with blue waves, a milky white boat has appeared. It swims as lightly and freely as a swan, attracting many tourists. This is an actual performance of a jet-powered shallow water tugboat at the National Transportation Advanced Experience Exhibition.
    This exhibition also introduces the Kangzang Highway built on the roof of the world, night navigation on the Sichuan River, sea towage of cigar-shaped wooden rafts of 10,000 cubic meters, ice sledge transportation on the Songhua River, and the newly built Zhanjiang Port, the largest port in South China. In the shipping and highway pavilions, advanced experiences of various professional natures are exhibited.
    This exhibition opened to the public in the Capital Laboring People's Cultural Palace from May 3 and is expected to close on the 25th.

　　全国交通先进经验展览会开幕
    在碧波荡漾的首都劳动人民文化宫后河上，最近出现了一艘乳白色的小船，它像天鹅般轻巧自如地游来游去，吸引着很多游人。这是全国交通先进经验展览会的喷水式浅水拖轮实物表演。
    这个展览会还介绍了修筑在世界屋脊上的康藏公路，川江夜航，海上拖运一万立方公尺的雪茄形木排，松花江上的冰撬运输，新建的华南第一大港——湛江港等的情况。在航运、公路两个馆内，展出了各项专业性的先进经验。
    这个展览会从五月三日起，在首都劳动人民文化宫公开展览，预计到25日闭幕。
