    Actively Train Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners to Strengthen the Health Workforce

    Currently, China's health workforce is composed of Western doctors who have mastered modern medical knowledge and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners who have mastered the knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine. Our people's medical and healthcare services have been established by relying on them. With the development of people's health services, in addition to a large number of Western doctors that must be trained, a large number of TCM practitioners must also be trained to meet the needs of the masses in medical and healthcare, and to inherit and promote the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine. This is a major task in developing China's health cause and a historical task determined by China's historical characteristics. Now, the Ministry of Health has decided to work hard to train new TCM practitioners to strengthen the health workforce. According to the Ministry of Health's plan, in addition to the training of some TCM practitioners by TCM colleges and TCM schools, the method of TCM masters taking apprentices will also be used to train a large number of TCM practitioners. Therefore, organizing TCM masters to take apprentices has become an important task for the health departments.

    Why is the method of taking apprentices used as the main way to train new TCM practitioners? This is because the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine has not yet been systematically and scientifically organized. The valuable experience of traditional Chinese medicine is not only scattered in medical literature, but also in the hands of hundreds of thousands of TCM practitioners. It is difficult to completely impart TCM knowledge to students and comprehensively inherit the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine by relying solely on school education. Although there are many ways in which traditional Chinese medicine has been passed down for thousands of years, the main method is still taking apprentices. Although this is a handicraft method of teaching, it has indeed played an extremely important role in inheriting traditional Chinese medicine and training TCM practitioners in history, and we still need to use this method now. In order to complete the task of training new TCM practitioners, health departments across the country must actively encourage and organize TCM masters to take apprentices under the principle of voluntary combination between teachers and apprentices, and carry out this work.

    In the old society, TCM masters taking apprentices had great spontaneity and randomness. The ruling class of the old society did not care at all about how to teach, how to learn, and how to use them after they were trained. Now that we are using the traditional form of taking apprentices, we cannot do the same as in the past. We must achieve planned training and planned use. We must consider the needs of the people and the development of China's medicine, as well as the future and prospects of the trained TCM practitioners. We must consider both the quantity and quality of TCM practitioners trained; we must not only reasonably arrange their work for the new TCM practitioners trained, but also enable them to have the possibility of improvement in the future.

    In order to realize the task of training TCM practitioners, first of all, there must be an appropriate number of apprentices to inherit the experience now scattered in the hands of TCM practitioners. After working for a period of time, the apprentices should also be organized to pursue further studies to enable them to receive certain modern medical knowledge and improve their technical level. Taking apprentices must emphasize both quantity and quality, and neither should be neglected. The practice of shoddy work is wrong. TCM practitioners in health centers, joint clinics, and other TCM practitioners should be welcomed as long as they are willing to take apprentices. However, the apprentices they take must be able to truly inherit the teacher's experience, or be proficient in the knowledge of a certain subject of TCM, or learn a technology that can independently carry out treatment work. After the apprentices have completed their studies, the health departments in various places should issue academic certificates and be reasonably responsible for arranging their work.

    At present, health departments in various places have begun to pay attention to the arrangement of TCM masters taking apprentices. The problem in the future is to strengthen leadership. We must use the working method of the mass line to solve the problems of who learns, who teaches, how to learn, how to teach, and the learning of various different subjects. It is not appropriate to make a uniform regulation, because it cannot suit the specific conditions of various places. Specific assistance should be given to grassroots health organizations, such as registering the number of apprentices, designating supplementary teaching materials, and helping them solve difficulties in the teaching process. In addition, health departments in various places should comprehensively plan this work based on the specific conditions of the locality and include this work in the current work agenda. In order to complete the tasks stipulated by the state, it is necessary to find out the actual situation and put the work plan on a reliable basis according to needs and possibilities; and carry out a series of ideological and organizational work to promote the development of this work.

    Training new TCM practitioners is a historical task for our generation, a glorious task shared by health departments at all levels, the vast number of TCM practitioners across the country, and the people. We should work hard to complete it.

    积极培养中医，壮大卫生工作队伍
    目前我国的卫生工作队伍，是由掌握现代医药知识的西医和掌握祖国医药知识的中医所组成的。我国人民的医疗保健事业，就是依靠他们建立起来的。随着人民保健事业的发展，除了必须大量培养西医以外，还必须大量培养中医，才能满足人民群众在医疗保健方面的要求，并且使祖国医学遗产得到继承和发扬。这是发展我国卫生事业的一项重大任务，也是我国历史特点所决定的一项历史任务。现在，卫生部已经决定要努力培养新的中医，以壮大卫生工作队伍。根据卫生部的规划，除了由中医学院和中医学校培养一部分中医以外，还要用中医带徒弟的方式来大量培养中医。因此，组织中医带徒弟就成为卫生部门当前的一项重要工作。
    为什么要用带徒弟的方式作为培养新的中医的主要方式呢？这是因为祖国医药遗产目前还没有经过系统的科学的整理，祖国医学的宝贵经验不但散载在医药文献上，而且散存在数十万中医的手里。仅仅依靠学校教育，是很难完满地向学生传授中医知识的，也很难把祖国医学遗产全面承受下来。数千年来，中医流传的方式尽管很多，但是主要的方式还是带徒弟。这虽然是手工业方式的传授方法，但是它对于继承祖国医学和培养中医，在历史上确实发生过极其重要的作用，而现在我们仍然须要用这种方法。为了完成培养新中医的任务，全国各地卫生部门必须在师徒自愿结合的原则下，积极鼓励和组织中医带徒弟，把这项工作开展起来。
    旧社会的中医带徒弟，有着很大的自发性和自流性，如何教，如何学，学成后如何使用，旧社会的统治阶级是根本不关心的。现在我们采用传统的带徒弟的形式，就不能同过去一样了，必须做到有计划地培养和有计划地使用。必须考虑到人民的需要和我国医学的发展，以及培养出来的中医的出路和前途。我们既要考虑培养中医的数量，也要考虑培养的质量；对培养出来的新的中医，不但要合理地安排他们的工作，还要使他们将来有提高的可能。
    为了实现培养中医的任务，首先要有适当数量的学徒来继承现在散存在中医手里的经验。学徒在经过一定时间的工作以后，还应当组织他们进修，使他们接受一定的现代医学知识，提高他们的技术水平。带徒弟必须量、质并重，不可偏废，粗制滥造的作法是不对的。卫生所、联合诊所的中医以及其他中医，只要他们愿意带徒弟，都应当受到欢迎。但是，他们带出的徒弟必须能够真正继承老师的经验，或者通晓中医某一科的知识，或者学成一种技术，能够独立进行治疗工作。在徒弟学成以后，各地卫生部门应当发给学历证明书，合理地负责安排他们的工作。
    目前各地卫生部门已经开始重视对中医带徒弟这一工作的安排，今后的问题是要加强领导。必须用群众路线的工作方法来解决谁学、谁带、如何学、如何带以及各种不同学科的学习等等问题，硬性地作出一个统一的规定是不能适合各地具体情况的，因而也是不妥当的。对于卫生基层组织应当给以具体的帮助，如登记学徒人数，指定辅助教材，帮助他们解决教学过程中的困难。此外，各地卫生部门应该根据当地的具体情况，把这项工作加以全面规划，并且把这项工作列入当前的工作日程。为了完成国家规定的任务，必须摸清实际情况，根据需要与可能，把工作规划置于可靠的基础之上；并且进行一系列的思想工作和组织工作，以推动这一工作的开展。
    培养新的中医，是我们这一代人的历史任务，是各级卫生部门、全国广大中医和人民群众共同的光荣的任务，我们应当努力去完成它。
