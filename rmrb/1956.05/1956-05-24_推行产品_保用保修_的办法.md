Methods for Promoting Product "Warranty and Repair"
Kong Sang

Recently, the newly produced Golden Star, Hero, Guan Le Ming, and Langqin brand fountain pens in Shanghai have been well received by general consumers. This is not only because these fountain pens have few or no common defects such as non-smooth nibs, leaky ink sacs, and deformed plastic pen caps, but also because the manufacturing enterprises have established a "warranty and repair" system responsible to customers. For example, the Qianghua Fountain Pen Factory has established a repair department. If a customer buys a Langqin brand round-tip fountain pen produced by this factory and it is damaged within six months according to the methods of use and storage stipulated by the factory, the repair department will provide free repairs. If it is damaged due to careless use, or after more than six months of use, the repair department is also responsible for repairing it, but a cost fee will be charged. Although the warranty period is a bit short, it is still better than not having any warranty or repair at all.

Consumers welcome manufacturing enterprises to provide warranty and repair for their products, and there is a reason for this. Because many daily-use industrial products either have poor quality or are damaged locally after a short period of use due to careless use. What to do with these things? Throw it away? It's a bit of a waste; keep it? It's not very useful; take it for repair? Some things have nowhere to be repaired. If the production unit establishes a "warranty and repair" system, these problems will be easily solved: you can turn bad things into good things again without spending any money or spending a little more money. This reduces losses for consumers and, for society, fully utilizes all available materials and increases the social lifespan of products.

Some people say: "The 'warranty and repair' system is good for consumers, but it adds a lot of trouble to manufacturing enterprises, which is detrimental to production." Of course, compared with the business method of "no recognition after leaving the door," the "warranty and repair" system does add trouble to enterprises. However, many troubles are caused by the production enterprises themselves: the better the product quality, the fewer the returns for exchange and repair, and the less trouble; the worse the product quality, the more returns for exchange and repair, and the more trouble. After an enterprise establishes a "warranty and repair" system, in order to minimize the number of products returned for repair or exchange, the enterprise's leaders and all employees will try to improve product quality, and even if substandard or waste products are produced, they will not be sold as good products. Therefore, the "warranty and repair" system is a good way to urge production enterprises to effectively improve product quality and stop shoddy manufacturing. Production enterprises should widely use this method to produce more, better, and cheaper daily-use industrial products for the people!

### 推行产品“保用保修”的办法

    推行产品“保用保修”的办法
    孔桑
    最近上海新出产的金星、英雄、关勒铭和浪琴等牌金笔，很得到一般消费者的好评。这不只是因为这些金笔没有或很少有笔尖不圆滑，笔胆漏水，笔套塑胶变型等通病，并且还因为生产企业建立了对顾客负责的“保用保修”制度。例如强华金笔厂建立了修理部。顾客买了这个厂生产的浪琴牌圆头金笔，按照工厂所规定的办法使用和保管，用不到六个月就损坏的，修理部就给以免费修理。因为使用时不谨慎，或者使用时间超过了六个月才坏的，修理部也负责修理，但要收成本费。尽管保用的时间短了一些，但是，毕竟比根本不保用保修好得多了。
    消费者欢迎生产企业对自己的产品保用保修，是有道理的。因为有不少的日用工业品，或者由于质量不好，或者由于使用时不谨慎，用不了多久就局部损坏了。对这些东西怎样办呢？把它扔掉吗？又有点可惜；保存起来吗？又没多大用处；拿去修理吗？有些东西就没有地方修理。如果生产单位建立了“保用保修”制度，这些问题就好解决了：不再花钱或再花一点钱就可以把坏的东西变成好的东西。这对消费者来说，是减少损失；对社会来说，是充分利用了一切可以利用的物资，增加了产品的社会使用寿命。
    有些人说：“保用保修”制度对消费者好是好，可是却给生产企业增加不少麻烦，这对生产是不利的。当然，比起“出门不认货”的经营办法来，“保用保修”制度确实给企业增加麻烦。但是，很多麻烦是生产企业自己造成的：产品质量越好，退回来掉换和修理的就越少，麻烦也越少；产品质量越坏，退回来掉换和修理的就越多，麻烦也越多。一个企业建立“保用保修”制度以后，为了使退回来修理或掉换的产品尽可能地少，企业的领导人员和全体职工，就会设法提高产品质量，即使生产了次品或废品，也不会把它们冒充好品出售。所以，“保用保修”制度是督促生产企业切实改进产品质量，制止粗制滥造的一个好办法。生产企业应该广泛地运用这个办法，为人民生产出更多、更好、更便宜的日用工业品来！
