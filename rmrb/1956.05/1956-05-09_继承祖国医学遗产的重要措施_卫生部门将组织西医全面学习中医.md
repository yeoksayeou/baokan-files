Xinhua News Agency, 8th - A person in charge of the Ministry of Health today spoke to Xinhua News Agency reporters about measures to improve Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) work. He said: Currently, the focus of TCM work should be on Western medicine doctors learning TCM, properly arranging the careers of TCM doctors, and specifically resolving the issue of TCM doctors taking apprentices.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Health pointed out that it is necessary to conscientiously organize senior Western doctors to systematically and comprehensively study the theories and experiences of TCM. They should first study classic works such as the "Huangdi Neijing (Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon)", "Treatise on Cold Damage", "Synopsis of Prescriptions of the Golden Chamber", and "Shennong's Classic of Materia Medica," and then combine this with clinical practice to study famous works from various departments throughout history, as well as the rich clinical experience of current TCM doctors. The learning methods can be both off-the-job and on-the-job. On-the-job learning should begin immediately, with approximately 5,000 Western doctors participating this year, organized separately by the health departments of each province and city, with a study period of three years. Classes will begin in May in the southern provinces and in June in the northern provinces. About 400 Western doctors will be studying off-the-job this year, initially decided to be concentrated in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Chengdu, with a study period of two years. Western doctors who achieve good results in learning TCM will be rewarded.

In the future, TCM doctors should be widely absorbed into the work of health care and disease prevention institutions. In hospitals, outpatient clinics, factory and mining medical units, and various prevention and research institutions in large and medium-sized cities, departments, offices, or groups of TCM should be established according to the specific situation. Consideration can be given to selecting TCM doctors with prestige and academic experience to take on leadership roles or participate in research and teaching work, and people should be sent to study with talented veteran TCM doctors. Local grassroots health organizations (county hospitals and district health centers, etc.) should be widely supplemented by TCM doctors. At the same time, leadership over TCM and integrated Chinese-Western medicine clinics should be strengthened.

The person in charge of the Ministry of Health said that in the future, encouraging TCM doctors to take apprentices should be encouraged, with plans to cultivate hundreds of thousands of new TCM practitioners in this way within seven years. This is an important measure to inherit the legacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Local health administrative departments should list this work as one of their central tasks and provide specific leadership and assistance in teaching.

　　继承祖国医学遗产的重要措施
    卫生部门将组织西医全面学习中医
    新华社8日讯  卫生部负责人今天对新华社记者发表关于改进中医工作的措施。他说：目前中医工作，应该抓住西医学习中医；妥善地安排中医的职业和具体解决中医带徒弟问题等几个方面。
    卫生部负责人指出，必须认真组织高级西医师系统地、全面地学习中医的理论和经验，先学习“内经”、“伤寒论”、“金匮要略”、“本草经”等经典著作，然后结合临床学习历代各科名著，以及现在中医师丰富的临床经验。学习的方法，可采取离职学习和在职学习两种。在职学习应该立即开始，今年大约有五千个西医参加，由各省市卫生部门分别组织，学习期限三年。南方各省五月份开课，北方各省六月份开课。今年离职学习的西医大约有四百多人，初步决定分别集中在北京、天津、上海、广州、武汉、成都六地学习，学习期限两年。西医学习中医成绩良好的给予奖励。
    今后要广泛地吸收中医参加卫生医疗和卫生防疫机构工作。在大中城市的医院、门诊部、厂矿医疗单位和各种防治研究机构中，应该根据具体情况，分别建立中医科、室或组，可以考虑遴选有威望和学术经验的中医担任领导工作或参加研究、教学工作，并且派人向有才学的老中医学习。各地基层卫生组织（县卫生院和区卫生所等）应该广泛地依靠中医充实起来，同时，要加强对中医和中西医联合诊所的领导。
    卫生部负责人说，今后应该鼓励中医带徒弟，计划在七年内通过这种方式培养出数十万新生的中医力量。这是继承祖国医学遗产的一个重要措施。各地卫生行政部门要把这项工作列为中心任务之一，在教学上要给予具体领导和帮助。
