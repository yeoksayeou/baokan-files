Since the beginning of this year, the rural market across the country has been more prosperous than last year. According to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, the total sales volume in the country in the first quarter of this year increased compared with the same period last year. The procurement plan for the first quarter was completed satisfactorily. However, the sales plans of the Ministry of Commerce and the Supply and Marketing Cooperatives for the first quarter were not fulfilled. Although the sales volume of certain means of production increased, many means of production were out of stock. The sales volume of some consumer goods decreased compared with the same period last year. A portion of the currency that the state invested in the rural market for purchasing agricultural products and issuing agricultural loans has not yet been withdrawn. These indicate that the rural market this spring is not active enough.

One important factor for the lack of vibrancy in the rural market is that the work of state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives cannot adapt to the new situation in the rural market. With the large-scale development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, farmers urgently need various means of production, but state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives did not adequately estimate this in advance, and their preparations were insufficient. The supply of many farm tools, especially small ones, has become difficult. Regarding the supply of consumer goods, some commercial staff members mistakenly believe that farmers have invested all their money in production and have no money to buy consumer goods. Moreover, the off-season for commerce has arrived, so they are not actively procuring goods to meet the needs of farmers' lives. After agricultural cooperativization, farmers are very busy with production and indeed have little time to go to market, but this does not mean that their need for commerce has decreased. They require commercial departments to supply daily necessities locally and purchase small local products locally. However, there are currently too few retail and purchasing points of supply and marketing cooperatives. For example, in Hebei Province, there is an average of only one retail point for every one and a half townships and eight administrative villages. This clearly cannot meet the needs of farmers. In the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, some small traders and peddlers in rural areas joined agricultural cooperatives, but state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives cannot completely replace the tasks they undertook. Thus, the inability of rural commercial institutions and personnel to meet the needs of farmers affects the vitality of the rural market.

The significant reduction in rural sideline and handicraft production, and the resulting decrease in temporary income for a considerable portion of poor farmers and handicraft workers, is also a factor contributing to the current lack of vitality in the rural market. On the one hand, this is because after agricultural cooperativization, most of the rural labor force has been organized into agriculture, and many agricultural cooperatives lack unified arrangements for sideline and handicraft production, thus reducing sideline and handicraft production. Some agricultural cooperatives mistakenly emphasize unified production within the cooperative for some family sideline and handicraft production that is suitable for decentralized operation, and some cooperatives even restrict members from engaging in family sideline and handicraft production. On the other hand, some agricultural cooperatives set the labor remuneration for agriculture relatively high, while setting the labor remuneration for sideline and handicraft production unifiedly operated within the cooperative very low. Therefore, members are unwilling to engage in sideline and handicraft production. This not only directly affects the reduction of temporary income for poor farmers and handicraft workers, but also makes it impossible for commercial departments to complete the procurement tasks for many sideline and handicraft products, directly affecting the vitality of the rural market.

Judging from the current amount of social currency in circulation and the situation of currency withdrawal, there is still money in rural areas. Some of this money is stored in agricultural cooperatives, waiting to be used for purchasing means of production; another part, accounting for about 50% to 70% of the total rural currency, is in the hands of wealthy farmers. Because many agricultural cooperatives adopt inappropriate methods that violate the principle of mutual benefit for middle and poor peasants when mobilizing farmers to pay share funds and investments, some district and township cadres mistakenly believe that to run cooperatives frugally, they must restrict farmers from buying consumer goods, making wealthy farmers afraid of revealing their wealth, unwilling to save, and unwilling to buy things. Some farmers are also afraid that the income of agricultural cooperatives is unreliable, especially households with less labor force are afraid that their income will decrease after transitioning to advanced cooperatives with payment based on labor, so they save money as a contingency. In addition, a considerable portion of the agricultural loans and advance purchase deposits issued by the state this year are still retained in agricultural cooperatives, with little being directly distributed to farmers. This money cannot circulate, also affecting the vitality of the rural market.

To change the current situation of insufficient activity in the rural market, first of all, the work of state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives must adapt to the new situation in the rural market. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places must strengthen the supply of means of production urgently needed by farmers. For small farm tools, they must adhere to the principle of "local sourcing, local processing, and local supply," quickly organize local handicraft producers to produce in large quantities, and supply them to farmers in a timely manner. If individual regions have difficulty organizing supply, the superior supply and marketing cooperatives should find ways to allocate supply. State-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives should deeply study the changing patterns of the rural market, understand the new requirements of farmers, and supply the consumer goods needed by farmers in a timely manner. In order to do a good job in supply and marketing, the existing commercial network must be adjusted. The wholesale institutions of state-owned commerce should be appropriately extended downward to facilitate the purchase of goods by supply and marketing cooperatives and small traders and peddlers in rural areas. Some of the business personnel of the supply and marketing cooperatives in market towns should be sent to rural residential areas to set up stores. In the future, it is necessary to unify the arrangement of the rural commercial network based on the principles of facilitating farmers' buying and selling and conforming to economic accounting, in conjunction with the socialist transformation of small traders and peddlers. For places where there are too few merchants and therefore cannot meet social needs, the reasons should be explained to the small traders and peddlers who have joined agricultural cooperatives, and some of them should be transferred back to engage in commerce. It is also possible to mobilize some merchants from the cities to go to the countryside. This work must be done before the peak commercial season this year. Before the rural commercial network has been adjusted, the method of delivering goods to the countryside can be adopted to support agricultural production and strengthen the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas.

Secondly, it is necessary to quickly restore and develop sideline and handicraft production. Various localities should, in accordance with the principle of developing diversified operations, make unified plans for sideline and handicraft production and agricultural production, so that those sideline and handicraft production that are needed by the people and can find sales channels can develop accordingly with the development of agricultural production. For sideline and handicraft production that is not yet suitable for centralized operation, agricultural cooperatives should allow members to operate in a decentralized manner and help them solve the difficulties in production and life. Agricultural cooperatives should make reasonable regulations on the labor remuneration for sideline and handicraft production unifiedly operated within the cooperative, with reference to the labor remuneration for agricultural labor, and should appropriately pay them a portion of the money in advance to solve their difficulties. Developing sideline and handicraft production can not only supply domestic and foreign needs, but also enable farmers to have money to buy means of production and consumer goods, which will further invigorate the market.

Thirdly, all localities should quickly and effectively distribute the grain and living loans recently decided by the State Council to poor farmers. The problem of grain supply in some disaster areas and cash crop areas that urgently need grain should also be resolved quickly.

Fourthly, a correct policy must be adopted for farmers' funds. The leading organs of each county must clearly explain to district and township cadres and the masses of farmers that if the funds of the agricultural cooperative are insufficient, they should, according to the needs of developing production and based on the principle of running the cooperative frugally, adopt the mass line method, fully carry out ideological work, and let the members voluntarily take out some money according to the economic possibilities of their families to invest in the agricultural cooperative as funds for developing production. Here, adhering to the principle of mutual benefit for middle and poor peasants in actual actions is of decisive significance. Some agricultural cooperatives adopted semi-compulsory methods to "dig funds" from wealthy farmers, with the result that their funds were like playing hide-and-seek, the more they were caught, the more they were hidden. They even secretly sold their fodder to other counties far away because they were afraid of not getting cash and a reasonable price. However, other agricultural cooperatives adopted the completely opposite method, paying interest on time to farmers who invested and deposited money, completely not interfering with the farmers' own income and expenditure, and also actively allocating cash to them when depositors needed cash, and paying a reasonable price when buying goods from them. In this way, the wealthy farmers in the area had no worries, and dared to use the money for developing production, saving, and normal consumption. Therefore, adopting a correct policy for wealthy farmers and correcting the erroneous practices of many agricultural cooperatives in this regard can not only invigorate the rural market, but also further strengthen the unity of poor and middle peasants and stimulate the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of members. This is necessary for developing production, invigorating the market, and consolidating agricultural cooperatives.

After the joint instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on running cooperatives frugally are further implemented, we can foresee that agricultural cooperatives will be more consolidated, the production enthusiasm of farmers will be higher, and agricultural and sideline production will be further developed. With the increase in farmers' income, the development of the urban and rural economy will also get more favorable conditions. As long as the local Party committees correctly implement the central government's policies and urge the relevant departments to do the above-mentioned work well, the rural market will definitely be further invigorated.

### 让农村市场进一步活跃起来

　　让农村市场进一步活跃起来
    今年以来，全国农村市场比去年繁荣。据商业部和全国供销合作社统计，今年第一季度全国的销售总额比去年同期有增加。第一季度收购计划完成得较好。但是，商业部和供销合作社第一季度的销售计划却没有完成。某些生产资料的销售量虽然增多，很多生产资料却脱销。部分生活资料的销售量比去年同期减少。国家收购农产品和发放农贷所投入农村市场的货币，还有一部分没有回笼。这些说明今春农村市场是不够活跃的。
    农村市场不够活跃的一个重要因素，是国营商业部门和供销合作社的工作不能适应农村市场的新情况。随着农业合作化运动的大规模开展，农民迫切需要各种生产资料，但是国营商业部门和供销合作社事先估计不足，准备工作做得不够，许多农具特别是小农具的供应发生困难。在生活资料的供应方面，有些商业工作人员错误地认为：农民把钱都投到生产上去了，哪有钱购买生活用品？而且商业淡季已到，因而他们就不积极进货去满足农民生活的需要。农业合作化以后，农民生产十分紧张，确是很少有时间赶集了，但是这并不表示他们对于商业的需要有所减少。他们要求商业部门就地供应日常用品，就地收购小土产。但是，目前供销合作社的零售点和收购点太少。如河北全省平均每一个半乡和八个行政村才有一个零售点。这显然是不能满足农民的要求的。在农业合作化高潮中，农村中有部分小商小贩转入了农业社，而国营商业和供销合作社又不能完全代替他们所担负的任务。这样，农村的商业机构和人员不能满足农民的要求，就影响了农村市场的活跃。
    农村副业、手工业生产大大减少，相当大的一部分贫苦农民和手工业者的临时收入减少，也是造成当前农村市场不够活跃的因素。这一方面是由于农业合作化以后，农村大部分劳动力都组织到农业中去了，许多农业社对副业、手工业生产缺乏统一的安排，因而副业、手工业生产就减少了。有的农业社，对一些适合于分散经营的家庭副业和手工业生产，错误地强调要统一在社内生产，有的社甚至限制社员从事家庭副业和手工业生产。另一方面，有些农业社对农业的劳动报酬定得较高，而对社内统一经营的副业、手工业的劳动报酬定得很低。因此，社员不愿意作副业、手工业生产。这样不但直接影响贫苦农民和手工业者临时性的收入减少，而且使商业部门对许多副业、手工业产品的收购任务不能完成，直接影响到农村市场的活跃。
    从当前社会货币的流通量和货币回笼的情形来看，农村里还是有钱的。这些钱一部分存在农业社里，等待着购买生产资料；另一部分约占农村货币总量50％至70％的钱，掌握在富裕农户手里。由于不少的农业社采取不恰当的和违反中贫农互利原则的方法动员农民交纳股份基金和投资，有的区、乡干部错误地认为，要勤俭办社就得限制农民购买消费品，使有钱的农民怕露富、不敢储蓄，也不敢买东西。还有些农民怕农业社的收入靠不住，特别是劳动力少的农户怕转高级社后按劳取酬，收入减少，因而存钱留后手。加以今年国家发放的农贷和预购定金，有相当大的一部分还留在农业社里，直接分给农民的不多。这些钱不能流通，也影响农村市场的活跃。
    要转变目前农村市场不够活跃的状况，首先，国营商业和供销合作社的工作必须使自己适应农村市场的新情况。各地供销合作社必须加强对农民迫切需要的生产资料的供应工作，对于小农具要本着“就地取材、就地加工、就地供应”的方针，迅速组织当地手工业生产者大量生产，及时供应给农民。个别地区组织供应有困难的，上级供销合作社要设法调拨供应。国营商业和供销合作社应该深入研究农村市场变化的规律，了解农民的新要求，及时供应农民所需要的生活资料。为了要做好供销工作，必须调整现有的商业网。要把国营商业的批发机构适当下伸，以便利供销合作社和农村的小商小贩进货。供销合作社在集镇上的业务人员要派一部分到农村居民点去设立商店。今后必须根据便利农民买卖、又合乎经济核算的原则，结合对小商小贩的社会主义改造工作，来统一安排农村商业网。对于商人过少因而不能满足社会需要的地方，应该向已入农业社的小商小贩讲清道理，让他们中的一部分转回来经营商业。还可以由城市动员一部分商人下乡。这些工作一定要在今年商业旺季以前做好。在农村商业网还没有调整以前，可采用送货下乡的办法来支持农业生产和加强城乡物资交流。
    其次，要迅速恢复和发展副业、手工业生产。各地应当根据发展多种经营的原则，把副业、手工业生产同农业生产作统一规划，使那些为人民需要又可以找到销路的副业和手工业生产能随着农业生产的发展，相应地发展起来。对于目前还不宜集中经营的副业和手工业生产，农业社应该允许社员分散经营，帮助他们解决生产和生活中的困难。农业社对由社内统一经营的副业和手工业生产的劳动报酬，应当比照农业劳动报酬作合理的规定，并且要适当预付给他们一部分钱，以解决他们的困难。发展副业、手工业生产，不仅能供应国内外需要，而且使农民有钱购买生产资料和生活资料，这就使市场能进一步活跃。
    第三，各地要把国务院最近决定发放的口粮生活贷款，迅速地、切实地发放到贫困农民手里。对一些急需要口粮的灾区和经济作物区，粮食供应问题亦应迅速予以解决。
    第四，对于农民的资金必须采取正确的政策。各县领导机关必须对区乡干部和农民群众讲清楚：如果农业社的资金不够，应该根据发展生产的需要，本着勤俭办社的原则，采取群众路线的方法，充分进行思想工作，让社员按照家庭经济的可能，自愿拿出一些钱来投入农业社，作为发展生产的资金。在这里，坚持在实际行动中贯彻中贫农互利的原则，具有决定的意义。有些农业社采取半强迫的办法去向富裕农民“挖资金”，结果他们的资金就像捉迷藏似的，愈捉愈藏，甚至因为害怕得不到现钱和合理的价钱，他们有草料也不肯卖给本社，却秘密地远远地卖到外县去。但是另一些农业社采取完全相反的方法，对于投资和存款的农民按时支付利息，对于农民自己的收入和开支完全不加干涉，而且当存款户需要用现钱的时候，还主动地拨给他们现钱，向他们收买实物的时候，也照付合理的价格。这样，当地的富裕农民就没有了任何顾虑，敢于把钱用到发展生产、储蓄和正常的消费上去了。因此，对于有钱的农民采取正确的政策，纠正许多农业社在这一方面的错误做法，不但可以活跃农村市场，还可以进一步加强贫农和中农的团结，激发广大社员的劳动积极性。这对于发展生产、活跃市场和巩固农业社都是必要的。
    在中共中央和国务院关于勤俭办社的联合指示进一步贯彻执行以后，我们可以预料，农业社将更加巩固，农民的生产热情将更加高涨，农副业生产将进一步发展。农民的收入增加了，城乡经济的发展也就会得到了更有利的条件。各地党委只要正确贯彻执行中央的方针，督促有关部门做好上述各项工作，那末，农村市场就一定会进一步活跃起来。
