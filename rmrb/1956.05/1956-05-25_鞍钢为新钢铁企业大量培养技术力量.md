Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, May 24th: Anshan, China's first iron and steel base, will train more than 6,000 cadres and 38,000 technical workers in the next seven years. The majority of this new technical force will be sent to new steel bases such as Baotou Iron and Steel Company and Wuhan Iron and Steel Company in the coming years. This is the latest plan formulated by Anshan Iron and Steel Company.

The talent training plan stipulates the training of more than 160 cadres capable of assuming the duties of factory directors, mine managers, and section chiefs, more than 370 workshop directors, and more than 1,280 foremen. In this cadre training plan, more than 2,000 senior engineering and technical personnel will be trained, including more than 100 who should have the level of iron and steel industry experts, not only possessing deep technical theory of the iron and steel industry, but also capable of solving a major technical problem. The remaining one thousand plus people should be able to independently handle a specialized technical problem. In terms of training new workers, they should master the techniques of more than 80 different types of work such as mining, iron smelting, steelmaking, coking, and steel rolling.

This year, more than 5,000 cadres and more than 13,000 workers will begin to be transferred to new jobs for internships; engineering and technical personnel who have not graduated from university will attend Anshan Iron and Steel Night University in batches for remedial classes. Some cadres and workers will also be sent abroad for internships. In order to train new workers, Anshan Iron and Steel has already opened 32 technical theory study classes and signed more than 600 training contracts.

In addition to implementing the above plan this year, Anshan Iron and Steel will also train more than 2,000 cadres and workers for 13 units, including Benxi Iron and Steel Company.

Several hundred cadres and workers who will be successfully trained this year will soon go to work in the new steel bases.

    鞍钢为新钢铁企业大量培养技术力量
    据新华社鞍山24日电　我国第一个钢铁基地——鞍山，今后七年内将要培养六千多名干部和三万八千多名技术工人。这支新生的技术力量，大部分要在今后几年里，送往包头钢铁公司、武汉钢铁公司等新的钢铁基地，这是鞍山钢铁公司最新制定的规划。
    在这个培养人材的规划里，规定要培养一百六十多个能够担负厂长、矿长和处长职务的干部，三百七十多个车间主任，1，280多个工长。在这一培养干部的规划里，要培养好二千多名高级工程技术人员，其中一百多人要具有钢铁工业专家的水平，不仅要对钢铁工业有较深的技术理论，还要能解决一门重大技术问题。其余一千多人都要能独立处理一科专门技术问题。培养新工人方面，要使他们能掌握采矿、炼铁、炼钢、焦化、轧钢等八十多个不同工种的技术。
    在今年，将有五千多个干部和一万三千多个工人开始调到新的工作岗位去实习；不足大学毕业程度的工程技术人员，将分批到鞍钢夜大学进行补课。还有一部分干部和工人将送往国外实习。为了培养新工人，鞍钢已经开办了三十二个技术理论学习班，签订了六百多份培养合同。
    鞍钢在今年除了要执行以上的规划以外，还要为本溪钢铁公司等十三个单位，培养二千多名干部和工人。
    今年将要培养成功的好几百个干部和工人，不久，就要到新的钢铁基地去工作了。
