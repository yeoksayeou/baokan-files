　　Rural Sideline Production Cannot Be Ignored
　　Si Zhenya
　　Rural sideline production is an important source of income for the vast number of peasants in our country. Many sideline occupations operated by farmers not only have historical traditions, but also play an important role in socialist construction, urban-rural economic exchanges, and meeting the material needs of urban and rural people.
　　Today, with the vigorous development of the agricultural cooperative movement, cooperatives have a detailed division of labor and can uniformly allocate labor. Originally, it was possible and should have been possible to take into account both agricultural and sideline production. Facts have proved that in areas where sideline production is closely integrated with agricultural production, the local rural economy is very active, the farmers' living difficulties are easily solved, and their enthusiasm for production is also very high.
　　However, the situation in many areas is not like this. We often hear some grassroots workers say: "If agricultural bumper harvest movement is not done well, we will be criticized, but it doesn't matter if sideline production is not done well." "Members engaging in sideline production is a waste of work time and should be compensated for." "Whoever engages in sideline production will be fined two earthworks." There are even practices of making farmers who engage in sideline production admit their mistakes in public. Under the control of this wrong viewpoint, they try their best to "cut off" sideline production. As a result, sideline production has almost completely stagnated, and a legitimate livelihood for farmers has been blocked. Due to the reduction of farmers' income and the failure to solve the living problems of some people, they have sought their own ways, seriously affecting the production and consolidation of agricultural cooperatives. For example, in Xinning Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Guiping County, Guangxi Province, 105 people did not work because of this; one production team completed only 40% of its plowing task because half of its labor force went out to make a living. Under such circumstances, the state's purchase and sales cannot complete the tasks according to plan. At present, some areas have already seen abnormal phenomena such as the failure to purchase oil crops, the shutdown of paper mills and basic construction departments waiting for materials, while there are many tea seeds (oil) on the mountains that no one picks and timber that no one fells.
　　Although some areas have carried out some sideline production, they have not received the due support from economic departments in terms of fundraising, raw material supply, and especially product purchase. In some areas, economic departments do not even purchase pigs and timber. Shunde County, Guangdong Province, stipulates that only Chinese cabbages weighing seven to eight taels each are purchased; tomatoes have three things that are not purchased: unripe ones are not purchased, small ones are not purchased, and overripe ones are not purchased; medicinal materials must be dry before they are purchased. The masses reflected: when the medicinal materials are dry, people are also dry. As for the purchase price, the prices of some goods in some areas are also on the low side. Many agricultural production cooperatives have not used sideline income to solve the living difficulties of their members first, but simply emphasized investing in agricultural infrastructure or transferring it for other purposes. The Shunli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiadian Township, Junxian County, Henan Province, lacked 30,000 jin of grain. After entering winter, the sideline income was 1,274 yuan, but the cooperative used the money to buy gramophones and coal. The members dissatisfiedly said: "When we are hungry, the gramophone cannot sing out food!"
　　The adverse consequences of neglecting sideline production and improperly handling sideline income are very obvious. This situation should not continue to develop. Especially in areas where spring famine occurred this year, farmers need to solve part of their living problems by developing sideline production under the principle of not affecting agricultural production. Therefore, in such areas, sideline production must not be ignored. How should we develop rural sideline production, that is, what can be developed and what cannot be developed, to avoid blindness in developing sideline production? Here is a general principle: sideline occupations that are needed for national construction and the production and life of the masses, and that have raw materials and sales channels, can be developed; for sideline occupations with raw material difficulties, production can be determined by the materials; for sideline occupations with sales difficulties, production can be determined by sales; speculative commercial activities should be prohibited. According to this principle, all localities can carefully analyze the types of sideline production, so that development should be developed, contraction should be contracted, and cessation should be stopped, and the plan for developing sideline production should be incorporated into the track of the national plan.
　　In order to be able to reasonably arrange agricultural production and sideline production, agricultural cooperatives in various localities should incorporate sideline production into the production plan. Agricultural cooperatives must pay attention to properly solving the problem of recording work points and distributing bonuses for sideline production. If this problem is not handled properly, it will either cause members to flock to agriculture or members to flock to sideline occupations. Both of these phenomena are not good. At present, agricultural production cooperatives generally adopt the following two methods to solve the problem of recording work points and distributing bonuses for agriculture and sideline occupations. One is to uniformly record work points and distribute bonuses for agriculture and sideline occupations, settle accounts according to the agricultural season, and solve the current living difficulties of members by means of advance borrowing or advance distribution. The other is to record work points for agriculture and sideline occupations separately, with agricultural work points recorded and distributed by the cooperative in a unified manner, and sideline occupations operated on a production team basis, earning and distributing cash. All localities should pay attention to continuing to create experience in this area, so as to develop both agriculture and sideline occupations. Some sideline occupations that are suitable for decentralized operation should be allowed to be operated by the masses themselves, and do not have to be unified into cooperatives.
　　The socialist transformation of private industry and commerce has been basically completed in towns and cities across the country, and the vast majority of farmers have also participated in agricultural cooperatives of a semi-socialist and socialist nature. This situation is extremely beneficial to the development of rural sideline production. However, it should also be noted that rural sideline production can no longer be carried out spontaneously as it used to be; if our work in all aspects does not keep up, and we do not actively lead and support rural sideline production, it will cause great difficulties for sideline production. Some economic departments in areas where rural sideline production is not going well must overcome capitalist management ideas, purely business viewpoints, and departmentalism, and overcome the negative and annoying attitude towards developing rural sideline production. For those lacking funds, adopt loan and pre-purchase methods; for those lacking raw materials, they must be transferred and supplied; for those with poor sales, help open up sales channels. Formulate plans to support rural sideline production in accordance with local conditions. Of course, in supporting sideline production, we must also prevent farmers from developing the idea of simply relying on the state to solve problems.
　　The current season is a busy season for production, and various localities should naturally not relax agricultural production because of the need to strengthen leadership over sideline production. However, the current problem is that many agricultural production cooperatives have abandoned possible sideline production, reducing the sideline income of members, affecting the lives of members, and even affecting the state's purchase plan and urban-rural material exchange. Therefore, leading organs and economic departments in various localities should strengthen leadership and support for rural sideline production, revitalize the rural economy, and develop urban-rural material exchange.

### 不能忽视农村副业生产

　　不能忽视农村副业生产
　　司枕亚
    农村副业生产是我国广大农民的一项重要收入。农民经营的许多副业，不仅有历史传统，而且对社会主义建设、对城乡经济交流、对满足城乡人民的物质生活需要，都有重要作用。
    在农业合作化运动蓬勃发展的今天，合作社有了细致的分工分业，可以统一调配劳动力，本来是能够而且也应该做到农业和副业兼顾的。事实证明，把副业生产和农业生产紧密结合进行的地区，当地的农村经济就非常活跃，农民的生活困难问题容易解决，生产积极性也很高。
    但是，目前有不少地区的情况不是这样的。常常听到有些基层工作人员说：“搞不好农业丰产运动要受批评，搞不好副业生产没有关系。”“社员搞副业是误工，应当补工。”“谁搞副业就罚他两个土工。”甚至有让进行副业生产的农民当众承认错误的作法。就在这种错误观点的支配下，他们极力要把副业生产“砍掉”。这样，副业生产几乎完全停顿下来，农民的一条正当的生活门路被堵塞了。由于农民的收入减少，部分人的生活问题得不到解决，纷纷自寻门路，严重地影响了农业合作社的生产和巩固。例如广西省桂平县新宁乡农业生产合作社，就有105人因此不出工；一个生产队因为半数劳动力出外谋生，以致犁田任务只完成40％。在这种情况下，国家的收购和销售也不能按计划完成任务。目前有些地区已经出现了一方面油料作物收购不上来、造纸厂和基本建设部门停工待料，另方面山上却有许多茶子（油料）没人采摘、木材没人采伐等不正常现象。
    还有些地区虽然进行了一些副业生产，但是在资金筹措、原料供应、特别是产品收购方面，得不到经济部门应有的支持。有的地区经济部门连生猪和木材都不收购。广东省顺德县收购大头菜，规定每个要重七至八两的才收；西红柿有三不收：不全熟不收，小的不收，过熟的不收；药材要干的才收，群众反映：等到药材干了，人也干了。至于收购的价格，若干地区的若干货品也有偏低的现象。许多农业生产合作社，没有把副业收益首先用于解决社员的生活困难，而单纯强调投入农业基本建设或移作他用。河南省浚县贾店乡顺利农业生产合作社缺粮三万斤，入冬后副业收入1，274元，社里却把这些钱用来买了留声机、燃煤。社员不满的说：“肚子饿了，留声机唱不出饭来！”
    忽视副业生产和对副业生产收入处理不当而造成的不良后果，是十分明显的。这种情况是不应该再继续发展下去了。特别是今年发生春荒的地区，农民需要在不影响农业生产的原则下，由开展副业生产来解决一部分生活问题，因此在这样的地区，副业生产更不容许忽视。我们应该怎样来发展农村副业生产，就是说，那些可以发展，那些不可以发展，避免发展副业生产中的盲目性呢？这里有一个大体的原则：对于为国家建设和群众生产、生活需要，并且有原料有销路的副业，可以发展；对于原料有困难的副业，可以以料定产；对于销路有困难的副业，可以以销定产；对于投机性的商业活动，应该禁止。根据这一原则，各地可以把副业生产的种类仔细地分析一下，做到该发展的发展，该收缩的收缩，该停止的停止，把发展副业生产的计划，纳入国家计划的轨道。
    为了能够做到合理地安排农业生产和副业生产，各地农业合作社应该把副业生产纳入生产计划。农业合作社必须注意妥善解决副业生产记工分红的问题。对这个问题如果处理不当，不是使社员涌向农业，就是使社员涌向副业。这两种现象都是不好的。当前农业生产合作社解决农业、副业记工分红问题，一般采取下面两种办法。一种是农业、副业统一记工、统一分红，按农业季节结账，用预借或预分的办法解决社员眼前的生活困难。一种是农业、副业分别记工，农业工分由社统一记账，统一分红，副业以生产队为单位经营，现挣现分。各地应该注意继续创造这方面的经验，以做到既能发展农业，又能发展副业。有一些适合于分散经营的副业，应该让群众自行经营，不必都统一到合作社里。
    全国城镇已经基本上完成了对私营工商业的社会主义改造，农民绝大多数也参加了半社会主义和社会主义性质的农业合作社。这一形势，对开展农村副业生产极为有利。但是，也应该看到，现在农村的副业生产已经不可能像过去那样自发地进行；如果我们各方面的工作赶不上去，不对农村副业生产加以积极的领导和扶持，就会给副业生产造成很大困难。农村副业生产进行得不好的地区的某些经济部门必须克服资本主义经营思想、单纯业务观点和本位主义，克服对发展农村副业生产所抱的消极厌烦的态度，对缺乏资金的，采取贷款和预购的办法；对缺乏原料的，必须调运供应；对销路不畅的，帮助打开销路。因地制宜地制定扶持农村副业生产的计划。当然，在扶持副业生产中，也要防止农民产生单纯依靠国家解决问题的思想。
    当前正是生产繁忙的季节，各地自然不能因需要加强对副业生产的领导而放松农业生产。但是，目前的问题是许多农业生产合作社对可能进行的副业生产放弃了，使社员的副业收入减少了，影响了社员的生活，甚至影响了国家的收购计划和城乡物资交流。因此，各地领导机关和经济部门应该加强对农村副业生产的领导和扶持，活跃农村经济，开展城乡物资交流。
