Xinhua News Agency, 8th. According to the Yugoslav News Agency, French President Coty held a banquet on the 7th to host Yugoslav President Tito, who is currently visiting France.

In his speech at the banquet, Coty expressed his hope that the easing of the international situation would be followed by understanding and positive agreements. He said, "This will guarantee the security and basic rights of all countries, will require moral and military disarmament, and will enable all countries to work together to improve the lives of all mankind."

Coty expressed his satisfaction with Tito's visit to France. He hopes to expand cooperation between France and Yugoslavia in all areas.

In his reply, Tito spoke of the friendship forged between the people of Yugoslavia and the people of France in the anti-fascist war. He emphasized the need to oppose the crisis of a new war, saying: "A new world war using modern weapons, especially atomic weapons, would threaten the survival of all mankind. If we understand these consequences, it is clear that we must reject the use of war as a means of resolving disputed issues, and we must seek new ways to reach agreements between countries and between peoples. In seeking these new methods, we must patiently await good results." Tito believes that the issue of disarmament should be resolved as soon as possible. He said: "The arms race requires huge material resources, which could be used to increase the welfare of the people."

Tito said: "The barriers that hinder people from knowing each other have gradually been eliminated. This is the most important thing in international relations." He believes that the consequences caused by these barriers "will further create separation and dangerous situations among the people of different countries."

Finally, Tito spoke about the development of friendly and cooperative relations between Yugoslavia and France. He also said that Yugoslavia and France "have the same or similar views on many international issues. Cooperation on these issues can greatly contribute to the easing of the international atmosphere and the consolidation of peace."

　　法国总统戈蒂举行宴会招待铁托
    新华社8日讯  据南斯拉夫通讯社报道，法国总统戈蒂七日举行宴会，招待正在法国访问的南斯拉夫总统铁托。
    戈蒂在宴会上致词，他希望国际局势缓和以后接着会有谅解和积极的协议，他说：“这将保证所有国家的安全和基本权利，将会要求道德上和军事上的裁军，并且使各国同心协力以便改进全人类的生活。”
    戈蒂对铁托的访问法国表示满意。他希望扩大法国同南斯拉夫在各方面的合作。
    铁托在答词中，谈到了南斯拉夫人民和法国人民在反法西斯战争中结成的友谊。他强调说明必须反对新战争的危机，他说：“一次使用现代武器，特别是使用原子武器的新的世界战争会威胁全人类的生存。如果我们了解这种后果，显然我们必须拒绝用战争的手段作为解决发生争执的问题的方法，我们必须寻求在各国之间和各国人民之间达成协议的新方法。在寻求这种新的方法时，我们必须耐心地等待良好的结果。”铁托认为应当尽快解决裁军问题，他说：“军备竞赛需要巨大物质资源，而这种资源是可以用来增加人民的福利的。”
    铁托说：“阻挠人民相互认识的壁垒已经逐渐消除。这在国际关系上是最为重要的。”他认为，这种壁垒所引起的后果“会进一步在各国人民之间造成隔阂和危险的局势”。
    铁托最后谈到南斯拉夫同法国的友好合作关系的发展。他并且说：南斯拉夫和法国“在许多国际问题上有同样的或类似的看法。在这些问题上的合作可以大大有助于国际气氛的缓和以及和平的巩固。”
