Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, May 12th: The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's large rolling mill has adopted workers' rationalization proposals, solved weak links in production, and increased production efficiency by 21%; it is estimated that the increased production of heavy rail throughout the year will be enough to pave two Jining-Erlian railways.

In the past, production was unbalanced between the various processes of the large rolling mill. The second rolling mill stood at seventeen seconds slower per heavy rail than the first mill, and thirteen seconds slower than the third rolling mill. Li Yuanhui, the foreman of the rolling section, summarized the experience of rapid rolling by three shifts and, based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, proposed the double-hole rolling method. This enabled the second rolling mill to simultaneously roll two heavy rails, reducing the rolling time for each rail by thirteen seconds, and bringing the production capacity of the three rolling mills into a new balance.

With the rolling capacity improved, the hot saw speed could not keep up with the rolling requirements. Xu Shoucai, the hot saw operator, proposed rationalization suggestions such as removing the interlocking device on the saw, which increased the hot saw capacity by 20%. At the same time, as the rolling capacity increased, it became necessary to accelerate the supply of raw materials. The heating section adopted the suggestion of Han Shichang, a heating worker, to increase the burner, and implemented a rapid steel heating method. The production capacity of the heating furnace also increased by 21%, meeting the needs of rolling.

    鞍钢大型轧钢厂采纳职工建议
    全年增产的重轨能铺两条集二铁路
    据新华社鞍山12日电　鞍山钢铁公司大型轧钢厂采纳职工合理化建议，解决了生产中的薄弱环节，生产效率提高21％；预计全年多生产的重轨，能铺两条集宁到二连的铁路。
    大型轧钢厂在过去各工序之间，生产不平衡，第二架轧钢机每轧制一根重轨要比第一架慢十七秒钟，比第三架轧钢机慢十三秒钟。轧钢工段工长李元辉，总结了三班快速轧钢经验，根据苏联专家的建议，提出了双孔轧钢法，使第二架轧钢机同时轧制两根重轨，每根重轨的轧制时间比过去缩短十三秒钟，使三架轧钢机的生产能力达到了新的平衡。
    轧钢能力提高了，但是热锯的速度赶不上轧钢的要求。热锯操纵工徐守才提出去掉锯上的连锁装置等合理化建议，使热锯能力提高了20％。同时，轧钢能力提高以后，需要加速原料供应。加热工段采纳了加热工韩世昌提出的增大烧嘴的建议，并且实行了快速烧钢法，加热炉的生产能力也提高21％，满足了轧钢需要。
