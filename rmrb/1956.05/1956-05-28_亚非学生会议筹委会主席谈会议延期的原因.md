Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 27th. The Asian-African Student Conference was unable to open as scheduled on May 26th.

    Earlier, the chairman of the International Preparatory Committee, Agustin Aminuddin, said that he could not tell anyone when the conference would open until the committee issued a formal statement. He said: The postponement of the conference is not due to its communist or capitalist nature, but out of consideration for how to make the conference a success.

    He said: Some invited countries suspect that the conference will be controlled by some kind of political tendency. In order to dispel this suspicion, the International Preparatory Committee will issue a statement stating that the conference is not controlled by any political trend, but to discuss the common problems of students. He believes that after the publication of this statement, more countries will be willing to come.

    On the morning of May 26th, five student representatives came here from Bandung to meet with the chairman of the International Preparatory Committee, requesting that the conference be held as soon as possible.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 27th. Student representatives from Malaya, Ceylon, Pakistan, India and Egypt who went to Bandung to participate in the Asian-African Student Conference arrived here on May 25th. So far, a total of twenty student delegations have arrived in Indonesia.

    亚非学生会议筹委会主席谈会议延期的原因
    新华社雅加达27日电　亚非学生会议没有能够如期在五月二十六日举行。
    早些时候，国际筹备委员会主席阿古斯丁·阿米努丁说，在委员会发表正式声明以前，他不能够对人说会议将要在什么时候开幕。他说：会议延期并不是由于它具有共产主义或是资本主义的性质，而是出于怎样使会议成功的考虑。
    他说：有一些被邀请国怀疑这次会议会受某种政治倾向的控制。为了消除这种怀疑，国际筹备委员会将要发表声明，说明这次会议并不受任何政治潮流的控制，而是要讨论学生们的共同问题。他相信，发表这项声明以后，就会有更多的国家愿意前来。
    五月二十六日上午有五个学生代表从万隆到这里来会见国际筹备委员会主席，要求尽可能快地举行这次会议。
    新华社雅加达27日电　去万隆参加亚非学生会议的马来亚、锡兰、巴基斯坦、印度和埃及的学生代表在五月二十五日到达这里。到此为止已经共有二十个学生代表团到达印度尼西亚。
