　　A Brilliant Example
　　——Notes on the Speech of Advanced Producer Representatives at the Eighth Conference

　　At the National Conference of Advanced Producer Representatives, fourteen representatives continued to speak yesterday. A prominent feature of yesterday's meeting was that a larger number of engineering and technical personnel, scientific workers, and medical workers spoke. In their speeches, they all used many facts to illustrate how they combined with workers and how they combined with practice.

　　Learning from the Advanced

　　Chen Zhiwei, a female engineer from the Minfeng Paper Mill in Jiaxing, Zhejiang, gave a vivid speech at yesterday's meeting.

　　She said that last year, the higher authorities assigned our factory the task of trial-producing seven new products of heavy industrial paper and national defense paper. These products had never been made in China before. The factory specially formed a new product trial-production team and designated me as a full-time engineer. The task before us was arduous. The main reason was that our technical level was low. In the past, these papers were imported from foreign countries. Some of the paper names were the first time we had heard of them. The Party carried out detailed education work in response to this situation. At the same time, the trial-production team was asked to complete the preparation work before the trial production more carefully. Wherever there was advanced experience, we would go there to learn. We collected process data and paper samples from all sources and seized the opportunity to consult experts. In order to improve the voltage resistance of 107 paper, we transported the pulp from Jiaxing to the Shanghai China Cement Company Paper Mill and borrowed the stone pulp tank to refine the pulp during the factory's Spring Festival holiday. We worked from the first day of the new year to the fifth day. Firecrackers kept sounding outside the window, but our master craftsmen and technicians were working in the workshop. After many failures over the past year, we finally completed the trial production of seven new products. Among them, five new products fully met the Soviet national standards and user requirements and have been officially put into production; the other two have also been basically completed.

　　Devoting Himself to the Bridge Construction

　　Several elderly people spoke at yesterday's meeting: Gu Maoxun, a sixty-year-old engineer from the Ministry of Railways, Liu Huimin, a fifty-six-year-old president of the Shandong Chinese Medicine Hospital, and Sun Ruizhi, a woman in her fifties. The speeches of these elderly people were filled with the voices of young people. Gu Maoxun, an engineer from the First Engineering Bureau of the Wuhan Bridge Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, introduced his main achievements. He said: The Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge is an old bridge. Before liberation, American and Chinese engineers generally believed that it should be scrapped. In early 1950, under the guidance of Soviet experts, after repeated research, it was decided to use the advanced Soviet experience in bridge repair to reinforce it. I personally participated in this reinforcement work, went to the site to conduct surveying and design, and completed the task as scheduled after more than three weeks of hard work. The design plan was reviewed and considered feasible, so construction was carried out accordingly. Within a short period of two or three months, the reinforcement project was completed, so that this dilapidated old bridge could bear the trains pulled by medium-sized locomotives without much labor and materials. I was awarded a commendation and reward from the Ministry of Railways.

　　In July 1955, the Wuhan Bridge Engineering Bureau launched a comprehensive conservation campaign. I made a more comprehensive consideration of the existing engineering design and thought of many uneconomical aspects of the bridge design. I proposed to revise the design opinions of these overpass bridges, which were supported by Soviet experts and leaders. Later, these designs were revised as necessary, saving the country an investment of 621,974 yuan. In October 1955, in view of the widespread over-strength of on-site concrete work and the large waste of cement, in order to eliminate this waste, under the guidance of expert Rudenko, I formulated specific measures to save cement consumption, which were notified to all sections and teams by the bureau order for implementation. Engineers Wang Xusen and Tang Yi also gave me a lot of help on this issue.

　　I am sixty years old. In the past, I originally wanted to end my life's technical work on the day the bridge was completed. Now I have revised my thinking: I will take the completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge as the beginning of my personal dedication to China's bridge construction cause.

　　Pilots Participated in Locust Extermination

　　Using airplanes to exterminate locusts is an unprecedented initiative in Chinese history. Since 1953, China's civil aviation departments have begun to undertake this glorious task. This is a particularly difficult flight because the plane has to fly at a low altitude of three to five meters all day long, avoiding obstacles such as utility poles, houses, and trees, and spraying "666" powder. At yesterday's meeting, Li Qichi, a pilot and advanced worker from the Professional Aviation Team of the Civil Aviation Administration, introduced the situation of their locust extermination in Hebei and other places. He said: Last year, we received an urgent task to go to Hebei to exterminate locusts. We received a notice on July 27, stipulating that 500,000 mu of locusts in Baoding Prefecture must be eliminated before August 10. We arrived in the locust area on July 30. We saw that the locust situation was indeed serious. If the locusts were not eliminated in time, the farmers' lives would be difficult for a year. According to past experience, it would take at least thirteen days for three airplanes to control 500,000 mu of locusts, so we were all anxious and came up with various methods to save time. In the past, two airplanes shared an airport, which always wasted a little time during take-off, landing, and adding powder.

　　We used to take off after eating breakfast, which wasted some time. We changed to taking off without breakfast and eating breakfast when the plane was refueling. When spraying powder, we often paid attention to maintaining the correct altitude and speed, and tried our best to land halfway and take off halfway to reduce the taxiing time on the ground. At that time, the days were longer and the weather was very good, so we could fly for a longer time, but according to regulations, the ultra-low altitude flight could not exceed six hours a day, and in special circumstances, it could not exceed eight hours. I wanted to eliminate the locusts as soon as possible, so I asked the captain to fly more. As a result, my longest flying time each day reached nine hours and twenty-one minutes, and the most take-offs and landings reached forty-eight, while the most in the past was only thirty. It was the hottest time of the year. Every time I finished flying, I was covered in sweat and my face was full of "666" powder. Even so, seeing that the locusts were dying in the areas where the powder had been sprayed, I felt unspeakably happy.

　　As soon as the locust extermination work in Baoding Prefecture was over, we received notices of urgent locust situations in other areas, requesting to send airplanes to assist. In August and September, we went to Cangxian, Huanghua, Tianjin, Qingxian, Yangcun, Langfang and Shengfang to put out locusts. In two months and five days of locust extermination flights, I flew a total of 246 hours and 8 minutes, 820 sorties, and exterminated locusts on an area of about 260,000 mu, safely completing the task without any accidents or errors.

　　"Enclosure Kiln Brick Firing Method"

　　The "enclosure kiln brick firing method" is an advanced method with great economic value in basic construction and worthy of promotion. Li Hanjiang, an advanced producer and worker from the Sucheng Kiln Factory in Anhui, introduced the process of learning this method at yesterday's meeting. He said: When it comes to firing kilns, in the past, Mengding kilns and horseshoe kilns were generally used, that is, the finished bricks were placed in a fixed kiln, and then coal was used to burn day and night, and coal had to be added at any time. The kiln site has only one fixed location, and the daily output is determined by the size of the kiln and cannot be increased arbitrarily. Last year, we studied and tested the flat-ground enclosure kiln brick firing method (that is, brick firing without a kiln). After preliminary success in the experiment, this brick firing method is popular in Changsha, Hunan. In the past, kiln workers in Nanjing, Jiangsu and Anhui also tried it, but they did not succeed because they did not get support. As a result, no one continued to experiment. In 1955, the Party called on us to increase production and practice economy. We studied that only by changing our production methods could we do it. We then decided to try brick firing in enclosure kilns in the factory. Brick firing without a kiln means that the bricks are piled up, the coal is loaded, and the kiln is built. After the bricks are finished, the kiln is gone. Everyone felt that this was not our traditional brick firing method and did not believe that this method would work. Later, we repeatedly studied and found that the characteristics of brick firing without a kiln are: burning bricks with coal and burning coal with bricks. As long as the amount of coal is properly matched and the bricks are piled up well, good bricks can be fired. As a result, our two experimental kilns were successful. Brick firing without a kiln can be transferred with the construction site. Wherever there is a large basic construction site, you can make bricks there and burn as much as you need. Therefore, you can avoid the time of setting up a kiln and reduce a large amount of kiln transportation costs. For example, if an office building is to be built in the western suburbs of Beijing, if the flat-ground enclosure kiln brick firing method is used, bricks can be made on the construction site in the western suburbs, and as many as you want can be fired. The maximum amount can be burned to 800,000 bricks at a time, which can build more than 3,000 square meters of houses. It also saves coal, reducing coal consumption by 50%-70% compared to the original old brick firing method, and does not affect the quality of the bricks. I hope my colleagues will try it.

　　Overcoming the Threat of Silicosis

　　Advanced producer Na Baoyue, who spoke at yesterday's meeting, is the leader of an advanced rock drilling team in the Jiapigou Mine, which belongs to the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry. Over the past few years, this team has successively promoted eight advanced experiences, including wet rock drilling, straight-line blasting, cemented carbide, large hole drilling, deep hole drilling, single-machine multi-lane, cycle operation, and compound rock drilling, and each time was more successful than the last. Therefore, the national plan has been overfulfilled for four consecutive years. Na Baoyue introduced the process of promoting wet rock drilling at the meeting. He said:

　　Our mine has always adopted dry rock drilling. When drilling rocks, the machine drills into the rocks, and a lot of rock powder flies up. Over time, these rock powders will slowly enter the lungs through human breathing, causing silicosis. Not only can they no longer continue to work, but if they are not treated and recuperated in time, there is also a risk of death. In the past, many people were unwilling to be rock drilling workers because they were afraid of getting silicosis. In 1951, the Party branch and administrative leaders wanted us to quickly learn and promote the advanced Soviet experience—wet rock drilling. That is to install a water needle in the machine to spray water on the rock, so that the rock powder will not fly up when drilling rocks. At that time, I was really happy. Seeing that our team leader Wu Lianzhong could not work in the pit because he had silicosis, it made me more determined to learn wet rock drilling. I experimented day and night. After more than two months, I finally mastered the technology of wet rock drilling. Later, the mine ran training courses. In addition to the technicians giving lectures, I also introduced my experience to everyone. By 1952, wet rock drilling had been promoted throughout the mine, which not only reduced occupational diseases, but also increased the attendance rate of workers from 60% to 98% in the past.

　　光辉的榜样
　　——记先进生产者代表在八日会议上的发言
    全国先进生产者代表会议上，昨天有十四个代表继续发言。昨天会议的一个显著特点是：发言的人中有较多的工程技术人员、科学工作者、医务工作者。他们在发言中，都以许多事实说明了他们如何与工人相结合，如何与实际相结合等问题。
    向先进学习
    浙江嘉兴民丰造纸厂女工程师陈志蔚在昨天会议作了生动的发言。
    她说，去年上级交给我厂试制七种重工业用纸和国防用纸的新产品的任务。这些产品国内从没有做过，厂里特地组成一个新产品试制小组，并指定我为专职工程师。摆在我们前面的任务是艰巨的，主要是我们的技术水平低，过去这些纸张都是从国外进口的，有些纸的名称我们还是第一次听到，党针对这种情况进行了细致的教育工作。同时也要求试制小组更慎重地完成试制前的准备工作。哪里有先进经验，我们就到哪里学习。我们从各方面收集了工艺资料和纸样，抓紧机会向专家请教。为了改进107纸的耐电压，我们把纸浆从嘉兴运到上海中国水泥公司纸厂，乘他们厂里春节放假的机会，借石头浆缸叩解浆料。我们从正月初一打到初五。窗外爆竹不断地响，我们的老师傅和技术工作者却在车间里工作着。经过一年来多次失败以后，我们终于完成了七种新产品的试制任务。其中五种新产品全部符合苏联国家标准与用户要求，已经正式投入生产；还有两种也已基本上完成。
    献身给大桥建设事业
    昨天会上发言的有几个老人：六十岁的铁道部工程师顾懋勋，五十六岁的山东中医院院长刘惠民，五十多岁的孙瑞芝老太太。这几个老人的发言中充满了青年人的声音。铁道部工程总局武汉大桥工程局一组工程师顾懋勋，介绍了他的几件主要事迹。他说：郑州黄河大桥是座老桥，解放前，美国和我国一般的工程师都认为要报废。1950年年初，在苏联专家的指导下，经过反复研究，决定运用苏联修复桥梁的先进经验进行加固。我曾经亲身参加这次加固工作，亲赴现场进行测绘设计，经过三个多星期的艰苦工作，如期完成了任务。设计方案经审核，认为可行，遂按照施工。在短短的两三个月内，便完成了加固工程，使这座残破不堪的老桥，不费很多工料，就能够承担起中型机车所牵引的列车，畅行无阻。我荣获铁道部记功和奖励。
    1955年7月，武汉大桥工程局开展了全面节约运动，我对现有工程设计作了较全面的考虑，想到了大桥不少设计不经济的地方，我提出了要修改这几座跨线桥的设计意见，得到了苏联专家及领导上的支持。以后这些设计都作了必要的修改，为国家节约投资621，974元。1955年10月，有鉴于现场混凝土工作超强度情况普遍存在，水泥的浪费很大，为了杜绝这个浪费，我在鲁登科专家的指导下订出了各项节约水泥用量的具体措施，由局令通知各段队实行。在这个问题上，王序森、唐仪二工程师所给予我的帮助也很大。
    我行年六十，过去原想在大桥落成之日，结束我一生的技术作业。现在我修正我的想法：我将要以武汉长江大桥的完成，为我个人投身于我国大桥建设事业的开始。
    飞行员参加了灭蝗
    使用飞机灭蝗，是我国历史上空前的创举。从1953年开始，我国民航部门开始担负起了这个光荣任务。这是一种特别艰难的飞行，因为飞机整天要在三——五公尺的低空飞行，躲开电线杆、房屋、树木等障碍物，喷撒“666”药粉。在昨天的会上，民用航空局专业航空队飞行员、先进工作者李启驰，介绍了他们在河北等地灭蝗的情形。他说：去年我们接到了一个往河北灭蝗的紧急任务，我们在七月二十七日接到通知，规定在八月十日以前必须将保定专区五十万亩的蝗虫消灭干净。七月三十日到达蝗区，我们看见蝗情确实严重。如不把蝗虫及时消灭，农民一年的生活便要发生困难。根据过去的情况，用三架飞机防治五十万亩的蝗虫，最少也得十三天，因此我们都很焦急，大家想出各种办法，来节约时间。过去两架飞机共同使用一个机场，这样在起飞落地和加药粉时总要浪费一点时间。
    我们原来都是吃过早饭后起飞的，这样时间就有些浪费。我们便改成不吃早饭起飞，等飞机加油时再吃早饭。喷粉时，我们经常注意保持高度和速度的正确，尽量作到半场落地，半场起飞，减少地面滑行的时间。那时白天较长，天气很好，可以多飞一些时间，但按规定超低空飞行，每天不能超过六小时，特殊情况也不能超过八小时。我想及早消灭蝗虫，就找队长请求多飞。结果我每天最长的飞行时间曾达到九小时二十一分，最多的起落架次，达到四十八架次，而以往最多的只有三十架次。当时是最热的时候，每次飞行完都是一身大汗，满面都是“666”药粉。虽然这样，但是看到凡是喷过药粉的地区，蝗虫都纷纷死亡，我心里真是有说不出的愉快。
    保定专区灭蝗工作刚刚结束，我们又接到其他地区蝗情紧急的通知，要求派飞机协助。我们在八、九两个月内，先后到沧县、黄骅、天津、青县、杨村、廊坊和胜芳等地去扑灭飞蝗。在两个月零五天的灭蝗飞行中，我共飞行了246小时零8分，820架次，灭蝗的面积约二十六万亩，安全地完成了任务，未发生任何事故和差错。
    “围窑烧砖法”
    “围窑烧砖法”是基本建设中一项有很大经济价值的值得推广的先进方法。先进生产者、安徽宿县窑厂工人李汉江，在昨天的会上介绍了学习这个方法的经过。他说：谈到烧窑，过去一般是用蒙顶窑和马蹄窑，就是要把做好的砖坯子放到一个固定的窑内，再用煤炭日夜不停地烧，还要随时添炭。窑场只有一个固定地点，每日的产量也就随窑的大小决定，不能任意增加。去年，我们学习和试验平地围窑烧砖法（就是无窑烧砖），经试验初步成功，这种烧砖方法，流行在湖南长沙一带，过去江苏南京与安徽烧窑工人也试验过，因为得不到支持，都没有成功。以致再无人继续试验。1955年，党号召我们增产节约，我们研究只有改变我们的生产方法。随即决定在厂里试行围窑烧砖。无窑烧砖就是坯子码成了，煤也上好了，窑也建成了，等砖出完后，窑也就没有了。大家都感觉到这不是我们的传统烧砖法，不相信这办法能成。后来我们反复研究，找出无窑烧砖的特点是：以煤烧砖，以砖烧煤，只要煤的分量配得恰当，坯子码得好，便能烧出好的砖来。结果，我们试验两窑都成功了。无窑烧砖，可以随建筑工地转移而转移，哪里有基本建设大工地，就可以在哪里做坯子，码起来就烧。因此，可以免除盘窑时间，减少大批的盘窑运费。比方说，在北京西郊要建筑一座办公大楼，若是用平地围窑烧砖法，就可以在西郊工地上做坯子，要多少，烧多少，最多的一次可烧到80万块砖，可以盖三千多平方公尺的房子。它还节约用煤，比原来旧烧砖法降低煤耗50％—70％，并且不影响砖的质量。我希望我的同行都来试一试。
    战胜矽肺病的威胁
    在昨天会上发言的先进生产者那宝玥，是重工业部有色金属工业管理局所属夹皮沟矿一个先进凿岩小组组长，几年来，这个小组先后推广了湿式凿岩、直线爆破、硬质合金、打大眼、打深眼、单机多巷、循环作业和复式凿岩等八项先进经验，而且是一次比一次成功。因此一连四年超额完成了国家计划。那宝玥在会上介绍了推行湿式凿岩的经过。他说：
    我们矿山过去是一向采取干式凿岩的。在凿岩的时候，机器打进岩石中，就飞起了很多岩粉。日子久了，这些岩粉就会慢慢随着人的呼吸到了肺里，得矽肺病，不仅不能再坚持工作，如果不及时医治和疗养，还有死亡的危险。过去很多人都不愿意当凿岩工人，就是怕得这种矽肺病。1951年，党支部和行政领导要我们迅速学习和推广苏联的先进经验——湿式凿岩。这就是在机器中安一根水针，把水喷到岩石上，这样在凿岩时岩粉就飞不起来了。当时，我真是高兴，这时又眼看我们的小组长吴连仲因为得了矽肺病不能到坑下工作了，就更加促使了我要学会湿式凿岩的决心。我就白天黑夜地试验，经过了两个多月，到底把湿式凿岩的技术掌握住了，后来矿里办了训练班，除由技术员讲课外，我也向大家介绍了经验。到1952年，全矿都推广了湿式凿岩，不仅职业病减少了，而且工人出勤率也由过去的60％提高到98％。
