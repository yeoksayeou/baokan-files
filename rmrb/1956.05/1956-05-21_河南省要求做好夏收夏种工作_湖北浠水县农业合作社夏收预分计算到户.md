Henan Province Requires Efforts to Ensure Summer Harvest and Planting
Agricultural Cooperatives in Xishui County, Hubei Province, Calculate Summer Harvest Pre-Distribution to Households

(Our newspaper, Zhengzhou, 20th) The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, at a meeting of prefectural and municipal Party committee secretaries held from May 14th to 18th, required that the current focus in rural areas should be on doing a good job in the summer harvest and planting. The meeting pointed out that a successful summer harvest and planting is crucial to ensuring farmers' income and consolidating and improving agricultural production cooperatives. The meeting demanded that Party committees at all levels treat the pre-distribution of the summer harvest in cooperatives as a central task, implement the policy of "deducting less and distributing more," strive to increase the income of more than 90% of cooperative members, and ensure that members can receive 61% of the total income. Summer planting work requires ensuring timely sowing, ensuring the completion of oil crop planting plans, and ensuring that areas that have not completed cotton planting plans continue to do so. Agricultural and forestry departments should quickly check and resolve seed problems. All localities should pay attention to ensuring timely summer planting while preventing drought, which requires vigorously solving the problem of water lifting tools and utilizing the water source from the more than 800,000 wells that have been dug; at the same time, attention should be paid to solving the problem of fertilizer and livestock feed.

(Our newspaper) With the summer harvest season approaching, 56 agricultural production cooperatives in Xishui County, Hubei Province, have already calculated the pre-distribution to households, and the remaining cooperatives are in the process of estimating production and formulating specific problem-solving plans. This year's summer harvest pre-distribution fully demonstrates the superiority of advanced cooperatives. The "October" cooperative in Wangcheng Township, based on the principle of "retaining less, distributing more," ensured increased income for the vast majority of cooperative members. The net income per cooperative member household increased by 54.8% compared to the net income per household of the three elementary cooperatives last summer, and by 85% compared to the net income per household of individual farmers last summer. Because the pre-distribution implemented the principle of "payment according to labor, more pay for more work," it greatly encouraged the labor enthusiasm of cooperative members. In the past, some members of the Qianfeng Cooperative in Liushen Township believed that they would not starve if they joined the advanced cooperative, and it didn't matter how much work they did. Now, after the pre-distribution, the members see that they are paid according to their labor and receive more pay for more work, and they are all actively working. One team in this cooperative had 4.7 mu of land to plow and transplant rice. Originally, the contracted labor was 18 workdays, but now 12 workdays can complete the work in one day, and the quality is guaranteed. In order to ensure that production and pre-distribution are not delayed, all agricultural production cooperatives have divided the cadres' forces into two groups to lead.

    河南省要求做好夏收夏种工作
    湖北浠水县农业合作社夏收预分计算到户
    本报郑州20日电　中共河南省委在五月十四至十八日召开的地、市委书记会议上，要求农村当前要做好夏收夏种工作。会议指出夏收夏种工作搞好是保证农民收入、保证农业生产合作社巩固提高的关键性问题。会议要求各级党委要把合作社夏收预分工作当成中心环节，贯彻执行少扣多分的政策精神，争取90％以上的社员增加收入，保证社员能分到总收入的61％。夏种工作要求保证适时下种，保证油料作物播种计划完成，保证没完成植棉计划的地区，继续完成植棉计划。农林部门要迅速检查和解决种籽问题。各地要注意在防旱的情况下，保证夏种适时，这就要大力解决提水工具，发挥已打成八十多万眼井的水源作用；同时要注意解决肥料和牲口饲料问题。
    本报讯　夏收季节已到，湖北省浠水县有五十六个农业生产合作社的预分已计算到户，其余的社正在估产和作具体问题的处理方案。今年夏收预分充分显示了高级社的优越性。望城乡“十月”社根据“少扣留、多分配”的原则，保证了绝大部分社员增加收入。每户社员纯收入比去年夏季三个初级社每户社员的纯收入增加了54.8％，比去年夏季每户单干农民的纯收入增加了85％。由于预分贯彻执行了“按劳计酬，多劳多得”的原则，大大鼓舞了社员的劳动积极性。六神乡前锋社过去有部分社员认为转了高级社不会饿死人，做活多少没关系。现在预分以后，社员看到按劳计酬，多劳多得，都积极劳动。这个社的一个队有四亩七分田要犁田插秧，原来包工是十八个工，现在十二个工一天就做完，而且保证了质量。为了做到生产预分两不误，各个农业生产合作社都把干部的力量分成两班子领导。
