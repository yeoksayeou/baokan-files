    A Trip to the Pamir Plateau
    Chu Anping
    I traveled for a few days on the Pamir Plateau, the westernmost part of our motherland. The broad and deep river valleys, the magnificent and towering cliffs, the endless layers of high mountains reaching into the clouds, and the perpetual snow from the peaks to the roots of the mountains, all give people a feeling of the vastness of the plateau. The diligent and simple Kyrgyz people have been herding their horses, sheep, and yaks, unique to the plateau, in this area for generations.
    The area I traveled through is right on the border; the two places where I stayed were less than a kilometer from the Sino-Soviet border. In the past, the Kuomintang reactionary government had stationed a border guard detachment in that area, which brought continuous disasters to the local herdsmen. Turdalie, who was shackled and imprisoned for two years by the Kuomintang reactionary government before liberation, and was released after liberation and became the head of that township, said: "Our township originally had more than 200 households. Since Sheng Shicai's betrayal and the arrival of the Kuomintang, the people could not bear the oppression and fled to other places year by year. By the time of liberation, only 83 households remained. The Kuomintang army demanded that our township supply 30 sheep every month, 1,500 to 3,000 jin of firewood per household per month, and two jars of milk per household per day. Two-thirds of the grass in the better pastures had to be supplied to the Kuomintang army, and we could only use one-third ourselves. Even among the remaining 83 households, more than 70 people were forced to serve as Kuomintang border intelligence officers, spying on Soviet military intelligence and monitoring each other within their own ethnic group. At that time, everyone had a difficult life and no food to eat. A good sheep could only be exchanged for 60 jin of wheat, and only from the Kuomintang army. After liberation, the people gradually returned to their hometowns under the warm comfort of the Communist Party. Now our township has 177 households. At the time of liberation, the 83 households had a total of 2,807 head of livestock of all sizes. By the end of 1955, it had developed to 8,647 head, more than three times the number in 1949."
    This township established a Red Light Pastoral Production Cooperative in February 1955, which was one of the first three pilot pastoral production cooperatives in the entire Xinjiang region. When I visited this cooperative, some members frankly said that they had not been able to fully realize the benefits of the cooperative when they first joined. At that time, everyone's main concern was that after joining the cooperative, the livestock would become public property, and they would not be able to dispose of it freely, and they would not be able to live according to the customs of their ethnic group, such as being afraid that they would not be able to slaughter sheep for the festival during the Kurban Festival, and they would not be able to slaughter sheep to entertain guests when distant guests came. Some bad elements also spread rumors saying: "The cooperative wants to sleep in quilts made of eighty meters of cloth, and eat collectively in a large pot with forty ears (the largest pot locally has four ears)." However, the facts of the past year dispelled everyone's concerns and shattered the rumors of bad elements. Those who still wanted to slaughter sheep for the festival could still slaughter sheep. Last year, during the Kurban Festival, seven or eight households in the cooperative slaughtered sheep. A member, Ayikulou, had a relative who came to visit him from the Soviet Union. He still slaughtered a sheep to entertain his distant relative as he did before joining the cooperative. After another member, Gedewayi's father died, his family still slaughtered a horse according to ethnic customs and invited the neighbors to eat. In addition, the cooperative lent him 50 yuan for emergency use, and the supply and marketing cooperative lent him white cloth to wrap the deceased. Some herdsmen also went to the nearby rural areas to inquire and learned that the cooperatives in the rural areas did not have everyone sleeping in one big quilt, nor did they have collective meals in large pots.
    The overall situation of this first pilot Red Light Pastoral Production Cooperative in the Xinjiang region in its first year of production was good, indicating that the road of cooperativization indicated by the Party and Chairman Mao is correct, and that the cooperative has obvious advantages. Member Aligexu said that he has realized many benefits of the cooperative. He himself has cattle, horses, and sheep. The grass eaten by cattle, horses, and sheep is different, and traditionally they cannot be herded together. Therefore, in the past, he was always unable to take care of everything, so that the livestock could not be grazed well. When calving in the spring, one person was too busy to handle it. Due to insufficient labor, he could not fully cut and store winter grass before winter. However, these problems have been largely resolved after joining the cooperative. His current job is to graze goats. He said that he is not only not busier than before joining the cooperative, but also feels much more relaxed and can concentrate on grazing goats well. Because everyone has a division of labor and each has specific responsibilities, the calving situation was also very good last year, and the survival rate of lambs was over 95% (the highest survival rate for individual households in the same year was 85%, and the survival rate for mutual aid teams was 92%). In the past, those who were unable to store much winter grass before winter were now able to store more winter grass after joining the cooperative. Everyone's livestock has developed in the past year. When Aligexu joined the cooperative, he only had three cows, five horses, and twenty sheep. Now he has four cows, nine horses, and forty-five sheep. He said that in the past, when he was working alone, he could not increase his livestock except by relying on the reproduction of his own livestock. However, last year, in the cooperative, because he worked hard and also learned veterinary medicine, he cured 250 sick livestock for the cooperative, and he was allocated twelve and a half lambs just in terms of labor dividends. He said: "The facts of the past year have made me fully realize that the cooperative is my home. Without the cooperative, there is no road to prosperity."
    The cooperative director, Abishari, and other members told me that in the past year, in addition to grazing their own livestock, the cooperative also grazed 200 sheep for farmers from other places and 300 sheep for state-owned ranches. Before winter last year, the entire cooperative had cut a total of more than 210,000 jin of grass, averaging 120 jin of winter grass per sheep, which was 10 jin more per sheep than the mutual aid team and 15 jin more per sheep than the good individual households. The calving season is the most stressful season of the year for herdsmen. After the establishment of the cooperative, they changed the old habit of digging earth cellars to raise lambs and used small sheds made of grass curtains to raise lambs. During the day, they followed the herd to deliver lambs, and at night, they took turns getting up three times to deliver lambs. In order to take care of the development of the lambs, they generally delayed milking the ewes for 15 days (this refers to the milk squeezed for human consumption), or if they originally squeezed it twice a day, they changed it to only once a day. In addition, they also carried out the improvement of grassland, planting alfalfa, planting highland barley, collecting firewood and hunting, organizing women to grab cashmere, and organizing camel teams to transport goods for supply and marketing cooperatives to increase the income of members.
    When the Red Light Cooperative made its year-end distribution last year, mutual aid teams and individual households outside the cooperative personally saw that the income of every member's household had increased. Kuru, the leader of the year-round mutual aid team in Erxiang, said: "You have run a cooperative for a year and pointed out that the pastoral production cooperative is the road for our herdsmen to live a happy life. We want to learn from you and transfer to the cooperative next year."
    In the part of the plateau I visited, in addition to the Red Light Cooperative established last year, a Red Flag Cooperative was established this year. When we climbed over the mountains and arrived at another pasture to visit the Red Flag Cooperative, the director of the Red Flag Cooperative, Tileke, began by telling us about the new progress their new cooperative had made in calving work. He said that they first made a calving plan before calving. They specially built a yurt to place the lambs, so that people and animals were separated, and the lambs could move freely. During the day, they lifted the top felt of the yurt to give the lambs more sunlight. Lambs over ten days old and lambs under ten days old were separated into two groups to prevent the larger ones from trampling the smaller ones. In addition to following the herd to deliver lambs during the day, they took turns guarding the night to deliver lambs as soon as they were born to prevent the lambs from freezing to death or being trampled to death. When cutting the umbilical cord, they also implemented the scientific method of tying the umbilical cord tightly before cutting it to prevent bacteria from entering the lamb's stomach.
    Tileke is a very young poor herdsman. He greeted us with a smile all the time. His voice was low and very gentle. I asked him: "Everyone elected you as the director of the cooperative, are you willing?" He said: "I never understood what people worked for in the past. Now, under the education of the Party, I realize that work is to serve the people. Everyone wants me to serve everyone more, and I am very willing." I said: "Running a cooperative and being the director of a cooperative will encounter many difficulties. Are you afraid of difficulties?" He said: "There are difficulties, but I am not afraid of difficulties. In terms of labor, I can work hard and take the lead to motivate everyone. It's just that I have no education, and I feel difficulty in organizing labor and formulating production plans. In such a situation, I ask for the help of the Party on the one hand, and often consult with the masses on the other hand. I believe that difficulties can be overcome." At this time, our fellow comrade asked him whether the Jiangninuer Pastoral Production Cooperative newly built in Atushi County this year challenged the pastoral production cooperatives and groups in southern Xinjiang to increase production. "Should you accept the challenge?" Tileke said quickly and definitely: "Accept the challenge." This young man, who at first glance seemed very weak, but whose will was very firm, gave us a deep impression.
    In the Red Flag Cooperative, we met the new member, Zhukai. Zhukai challenged Sharen, a member of the Red Light Cooperative, last year. Sharen told us: "Last year, Zhukai advised me not to join the cooperative, saying that after joining the cooperative, the livestock would be confiscated. Because I believed in the Communist Party, I still decided to join the cooperative. Zhukai said, you join and I don't, we each go our own way, and see whose livestock develops faster." At that time, he and Sharen each had three cows and ten sheep. After Sharen joined the cooperative, the cooperative took care of the difficulties in life. As a result of one year, the livestock developed to five cows, two horses, and twenty sheep. However, Zhukai broke his leg wrestling for sheep and rested for three months. His ten sheep only gave birth to five lambs. In order to solve the problem of food and clothing for the year, he slaughtered five sheep and sold five sheep, and by the end of last year, he only had three cows and five sheep left. Zhukai said: "I admit defeat, I now believe in the words of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The cooperative is indeed good, so I am determined to join the cooperative this year."
    When I visited the Red Light and Red Flag Pastoral Production Cooperatives, I saw their hard work and lively lambing labor. Every morning and evening, the herdsmen warmly hold the lambs they have delivered to the ewes to suckle. The Kyrgyz herdsmen have an unusually keen memory. Although each household has delivered dozens of lambs, they can clearly remember which lamb was born to which ewe without making any mistakes. They whistle lightly, calling out one ewe after another to feed the lambs. Those little lambs, sometimes sucking the milk of their mothers one by one, and sometimes jumping around on the pasture, are lively and healthy. There are many ewes that give birth to twins. The herdsmen worry that the milk of the ewes that give birth to twins is not enough, so they use cow horns to make "bottles" and feed the twin lambs artificially. There is a women's production team leader, Ayisha, who delivered 26 sheep last year, 8 of which gave birth to twins, for a total of 34 lambs, all of which survived. This year she delivered 70 sheep, and the results are also very good. The herdsmen all know that the development of pastoral production is mainly carried out through livestock breeding, so everyone attaches great importance to the annual calving work.
    The establishment of the pastoral production cooperative and its preliminary achievements have pointed out a happy path for the herdsmen. This year, many pastoral mutual aid teams in that area have requested to transfer to the cooperative, and many individual herdsmen have also requested to join the cooperative. On the morning of the day I left, Tuowutimaimaiti, the leader of the year-round mutual aid team in Yixiang, specially asked me to convey to the county leadership that they should approve their transfer to the cooperative as soon as possible. Although it is in the extreme west frontier of the motherland, although it is on the snow-capped plateau, the road of cooperativization pointed out by the Party and Chairman Mao is also like a bright light shining on the herdsmen on the frontier plateau of the motherland.

    帕米尔高原之行
    储安平
    我在祖国最西部的帕米尔高原上旅行了几天。那宽阔深远的河谷，那磅礴矗立的岩崖，那层层不绝直入云霄的高山，以及从山巅到山根的不化的积雪，都给人们一种高原旷迈的感觉。勤劳淳朴的柯尔克孜民族就在这一带世代相传地牧放着他们的马匹、羊群和高原特有的毛牛。
    我所旅行的一带正在国境边缘上；我两次投宿的地方都离中苏边境不到一公里。过去国民党反动政府曾在那一带驻扎了一个边卡大队；这也就给当地牧民带来了不绝的灾难。在解放以前被国民党反动政府上了脚镣关了两年、解放后才被释出狱、并且担任了那个乡的乡长的吐尔达列说：“我们这个乡本来有二百多户。自从盛世才叛变、国民党来了以后，人民不堪压迫，逐年逃亡外地，到解放的时候，只剩下八十三户了。国民党军队要我们乡每月供应三十只羊，每户每月供应一千五百至三千斤柴，每户每天供应两缸子牛奶。好一些草场的草，三分之二都要供应国民党军队，我们自己只能用三分之一。就是那剩下的八十三户中，有七十多人都被强迫担任了国民党的边卡情报员，探听苏联的军情，并且在本民族中互相监视。那时候大家生活困难，没有粮吃。一只上好绵羊只能换到六十斤小麦，而且还只有向国民党军队才能换到。解放以后，人民在共产党的温暖的安抚下，才陆续回乡。现在我们乡已经有177户。解放的时候，那八十三户共有2，807头大小牲畜，到1955年底，已经发展到8，647头，比1949年增加了两倍多。”
    这个乡在1955年2月建立了一个红光牧业生产合作社，这是新疆全区第一批试办的三个牧业生产合作社中的一个。我访问这个社的时候，有些社员坦白地说，他们最初入社的时候，还没有能够充分认识到合作社的好处。那时候大家主要的顾虑是怕入了社以后，牲畜归公，不能自由处理，不能按本民族的风俗习惯生活，例如怕过库尔班节的时候不能宰羊过节了，有远客来也不能宰羊款客了。有些坏分子还造谣说：“合作社要用八十公尺布做的大被子睡觉，要用四十个耳朵的大锅（当地最大的锅有四只耳朵）集体吃饭。”可是一年来的事实打消了大家的顾虑，击破了坏分子的造谣。过节要宰羊的仍旧可以宰羊，去年过库尔班节，社里就有七、八户宰了羊。社员艾衣库鲁有一个亲戚从苏联来探望他，他仍和没有入社以前一样地宰了一只羊款待他的远来的亲戚。另外一个社员 戈德瓦衣的父亲死后，他家仍旧按照民族风俗宰了一匹马请四邻吃饭，此外社里还给他贷了五十元济急，供销合作社又给他贷了给死者缠身的白布。还有些牧民到附近的农村里去打听了一下，知道农村里的合作社并没有大家在一个大被子里睡觉，也没有集体吃大锅饭的事情。
    这一个新疆地区第一期试办的红光牧业生产合作社在第一年生产中的总的情况是好的，说明党和毛主席所指示的合作化道路是正确的，合作社是具有明显的优越性的。社员阿力格许说，他体会到的合作社的好处很多。他自己有牛有马又有羊，牛马羊吃的草不一样，习惯上不能把它们合群放牧，因此他过去总是顾了这顾不了那，使牲口放不好。在春天接羔的时候，一个人也忙不过来。由于劳动力不够，过冬以前也不能充分割储冬草。可是这些问题在参加合作社以后大都解决了。他现在的分工是放山羊，他说他现在不仅不比入社以前忙，反而感到轻松得多，可以集中精神放好山羊。由于大家分工、各有专责，去年接羔的情况也很好，羊羔的成活率在95％以上（同年单干户的成活率最高的是85％，互助组的成活率是92％）。过去入冬以前无力多储冬草的，入社以后，就有能力多储冬草。这一年来大家的牲口都有发展。阿力格许入社时只有三头牛五匹马二十只羊，现在他有了四头牛九匹马和四十五只羊。他说过去单干的时候，除了依靠自己牲畜繁殖以外，再不能增加自己的牲畜；可是去年他在社里，因为劳动好，又学了兽医，替社里治好了250头病畜，单单在劳动分红方面就分到了十二只半羊羔。他说：“一年来的事实使我充分认识，社就是我的家。离开了社，再没有富裕的道路。”
    社主任阿比沙里和其他社员告诉我，去年一年合作社除了放自己的牲畜以外，还代外地的农民放了二百只羊，代国营牧场放了三百只羊。去年入冬以前全社一共打了二十一万多斤草，平均为每只羊储冬草120斤，比互助组每只羊多储十斤草，比好的单干户每只羊多储十五斤草。接羔时期是牧民一年中最紧张的季节。建社以后，他们改变了过去挖土窖育羔的老习惯，改用草帘搭成的小棚圈育羔。白天实行跟群接羔，夜间轮班起来三次接羔。为了照顾小羔的发育，一般都对母畜推迟挤奶十五天（这是指挤给人吃的奶），或者原来一天挤两次的，改为一天只挤一次。此外还进行了改良草地，栽种苜蓿，栽种青稞，打柴打猎，组织妇女抓山羊绒，组织骆驼队给供销社运输货物等，以增加社员的收入。
    去年红光社年终分配的时候，社外一些互助组和单干户亲眼看到户户社员的收入都有了增加。二乡常年互助组组长库鲁说：“你们办了一年社，指出了牧业生产合作社是我们牧民过幸福生活的道路，我们要向你们学习，明年也要转社。”
    在我访问的那一部分高原上，除了去年建立的红光社以外，今年又建立了一个红旗社。当我们翻山到达另外一个草场访问红旗社的时候，红旗社的主任提勒克一开头就告诉我们，他们的新社在接羔工作上有些什么样的新进步。他说他们在接羔以前先作出了接羔计划。他们专门搭了一个蒙古包安放羊羔，使人畜分居，使羊羔能自由活动。白天把蒙古包的顶毡掀开，使羊羔得到更多的阳光。把十天以上的羊羔和不满十天的羊羔隔为两群，以免大的把小的踏伤。除了白天跟群接羔外，夜晚轮班守夜，随生随接，以免小羔冻死踏死。剪脐带的时候，也实行了先把脐带结紧然后再剪的科学方法，以免病菌传入羊羔肚里。
    提勒克是一个年纪很轻的贫牧。他一直是笑眯眯地接待着我们。他说话的声音很低又很文静。我问他：“大家选你当社主任，你愿意不愿意？”他说：“我过去一直不懂得人是为了什么而工作的。现在在党的教育下，认识到工作就是为人民服务，大家要我多为大家服务，我是很愿意的。”我说：“办一个社，当一个社主任，都会遇到很多困难。你怕不怕困难？”他说：“困难是有的，但是我不怕困难。在劳动上，我自己可以苦干带头，来推动大家。只是我没有文化，在组织劳动力和制定生产计划上，我便感到困难。在这样的情况下，我就一面请求党的帮助，一面经常和群众商量。我相信困难是可以克服的。”这时我们同行的同志问他阿图什县今年新建的将尼奴尔牧业生产合作社向南疆各牧业生产合作社、组提出增产挑战，“你们应不应战？”提勒克迅速而肯定地说：“应战”。这一个初看起来仿佛很柔弱的、然而意志却很坚定的小伙子，他的谈话给了我们深刻的印象。
    在红旗社里，我们会见了新社员朱凯。朱凯去年曾经和红光社社员沙仁挑过战。沙仁告诉我们说：“去年朱凯劝我不要入社，说入社以后牲畜就要充公了。我因为相信共产党，仍旧决心入社。朱凯就说，你入我不入，各走各的，看谁的牲畜发展得快。”那时他和沙仁各有三头牛十只羊。沙仁入社以后，生活上的困难都有社照顾，一年的结果，牲畜发展到五头牛二匹马二十只羊。但是朱凯因为刁羊摔伤了腿，休养了三个月。他的十只羊只生了五只羔。为了解决一年的吃用问题，他宰了五只羊又卖了五只羊，到去年年底就只剩了三头牛五只羊了。朱凯说：“我认输了，我现在相信共产党和毛主席的话了。合作社确是好，所以我今年也决心加入了社。”
    我在访问红光、红旗两个牧业生产合作社的时候，都看到了他们那辛勤的生动的育羔劳动。每天清晨和傍晚，牧民们都亲热地抱着自己所接的小羔送到母羊身边吃奶。柯尔克孜牧民有着异常敏锐的记忆力，尽管他们每户都接了几十只小羔，但是他们都能够一一记清楚哪只小羔是哪只母羊生的，毫不弄错。他们吹着轻盈的口哨，呼唤着一只一只母羊前来喂奶。那些小羊羔，一忽儿一凿一凿地吸吮着它们的母亲的乳汁，一忽儿又在草场上乱蹦乱跳，活泼鲜健。生双羔的母羊很多。牧民们顾虑生双羔的母羊乳汁不够，就用牛角做成“奶瓶”，用人工给那些双生羔喂奶。有一个妇女生产组组长阿衣夏，她去年接了二十六只羊，其中有八只生了双羔，一共生了三十四只羔，全部成活，今年她接了七十只羊，成绩也很好。牧民们都知道。牧业生产的发展主要是通过牲畜繁殖的方式进行的，所以大家都非常重视每年一季的接羔育羔工作。
    牧业生产合作社的建立和它所取得的初步成就，给牧民指出了一条幸福的道路。今年那一带有许多牧业互助组都要求转社，很多单干牧民也要求入社。在我离开那儿的那一天早晨，一乡的常年互助组组长托吾提买合木提还特地请我代他向县领导机关反映，要求早日批准他们转社。虽然是在祖国极西的边陲，虽然是在雪峰连绵的高原，但是党和毛主席所指出的合作化道路，也同样像一盏明灯照耀着祖国边陲高原上的牧民。
