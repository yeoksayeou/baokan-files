Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 14th: The Secretariat of the All-India Trade Union Congress issued a statement on May 12th, saying that many of the demands put forward in the resolution passed by the Indian National Trade Union Congress at its recent annual meeting either completely conform or largely conform to the demands put forward by the All-India Trade Union Congress. This provides a basis for the workers of all trade union organizations to make joint efforts.

The statement of the All-India Trade Union Congress said that it will make every possible effort to ensure the realization of these demands through concerted action. It firmly believes that a united movement of all workers is essential to obtaining their legitimate rights.

The All-India Trade Union Congress recently suggested cooperating with the Indian National Trade Union Congress to fight for and safeguard the interests of workers.
