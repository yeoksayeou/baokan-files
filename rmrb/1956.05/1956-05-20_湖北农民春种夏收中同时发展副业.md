Hubei farmers are actively engaged in sideline production such as silkworm rearing and tea cultivation while simultaneously conducting spring planting and summer harvesting. In the Huanggang, Jingzhou, and Xiangyang Special Zones, farmers with a tradition of sericulture have expanded mulberry garden areas and increased the number of silkworms raised under the unified arrangements of the agricultural production cooperatives. By late April, the agricultural departments alone had promoted a total of 45,000 silkworm egg cards of improved varieties in these areas, an increase of more than eighty times compared to last year.

In the famous "Yihong Tea" producing areas of western and northern Hubei, members of agricultural and tea production cooperatives have strengthened tea garden management this year, promoted new harvesting methods, and opened up many new tea gardens and restored barren tea gardens according to the characteristics of mountainous economic development.

The sideline production of medicinal materials, sugar beets, fruits, and other products in mountainous areas and areas near towns has also increased in variety and expanded in scope due to the participation of farmers in these areas in agricultural cooperatives, based on their needs.

    湖北农民春种夏收中同时发展副业
    湖北省农民在春种夏收同时，各地养蚕、茶业等副业生产也很活跃。黄冈、荆州和襄阳等专区有养蚕习惯的农民，在农业生产合作社统一安排下，都扩大了桑园面积和增加了养蚕数量。到四月下旬，仅农业部门在这些地方推广的改良蚕种共有四万五千张，比去年增加了八十多倍。
    在鄂西、鄂北著名的“宜红茶”产地，农业和茶业生产合作社社员们，今年都加强了茶园管理，推行新的采摘方法，并且根据山区经济发展特点开辟了许多新茶园，恢复荒芜茶园。
    山区和靠近城镇地区的药材、甜菜和水果等副业生产，由于这些地区农民参加了农业社，也根据需要增加品种和扩大了经营范围。
