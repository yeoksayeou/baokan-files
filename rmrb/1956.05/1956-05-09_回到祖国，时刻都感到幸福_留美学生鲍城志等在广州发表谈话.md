　　Returning to the Motherland, Every Moment is Filled with Happiness
    Overseas Students Bao Chengzhi and Others Give Talks in Guangzhou
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th - The Guangdong Provincial Department of Education sent people to Shenzhen to welcome Bao Chengzhi and five other students who recently returned to the embrace of the motherland from the United States. The Deputy Director of the Education Department, Rao Huangxiang, hosted a banquet for them in Guangzhou that evening. On the 4th, Bao Chengzhi and others gave a talk to Xinhua News Agency reporters, saying that they felt happy every moment since returning to the motherland.

    On the day they arrived in Guangzhou, April 30th, they visited the Xinhua Bookstore's outlets selling science and technology books and learned about the publication of various science and technology books. Si Chongyao believed that the "Science and Technology Small Series" was published very well. It was published entirely to popularize scientific knowledge, and from this, one can also see the state of the people of the motherland marching towards science.

    They also told reporters about the obstruction they encountered from the US government when they requested to return to the motherland. Bao Chengzhi said that he had applied to return to China as early as 1952, but had not been granted permission by the US government. In 1954, he and Wang Zuqi, Chen Shihua and nine other students jointly wrote a letter questioning Eisenhower as to why Chinese students were not allowed to return to their own country. The letter stated that their return to their own country did not harm US security, refuting the excuse of the US government. This open letter was published in eight newspapers, including the Chicago Daily News, arousing public sympathy. Therefore, although US government agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Immigration and Naturalization Service often sent people to make trouble for them, attempting to hinder their return to China, they finally overcame various difficulties and returned to the embrace of the motherland under their firm and legitimate demand to return to the motherland.

    Returning with Bao Chengzhi were: Gao Youhuan, Pei Xiheng, Liao Shantao, and Si Chongyao. Bao Chengzhi studied at the Graduate School of the University of Washington and was a research fellow in electrical engineering at the university. He was an assistant teacher and research fellow in electrical engineering at Northwestern University, and completed his doctoral program. Gao Youhuan studied thoracic medicine at the West Africa Hospital in New York, the New York Special Paul Hospital, and the Bullock Chest Hospital in New Jersey. Pei Xiheng studied business administration at the Graduate School of Business Administration of Ohio University, and then studied business administration at New York University. Liao Shantao was a doctoral student at the Graduate School of the University of Chicago, studying mathematics and specializing in topology. Si Chongyao studied at the Graduate School of the Illinois Institute of Technology and at the Institute of Metallurgy of the Carnegie Institute of Technology, and researched and manufactured welding rods at the American Manganese Steel Company.

　　回到祖国，时刻都感到幸福
    留美学生鲍城志等在广州发表谈话
    据新华社广州8日电  广东省教育厅派人前往深圳迎接最近从美国回归祖国怀抱的鲍城志等五个留美学生，抵达广州当晚教育厅副厅长饶璜湘设宴招待他们。鲍城志等四日向新华社记者发表谈话，他说，他们回到祖国以后，时刻都感到幸福。
    他们在四月三十日到达广州这天，就参观了新华书店售卖科学技术书籍的门市部，并且了解了各种科学技术书籍的出版情况。斯重遥认为科学技术小丛书出版得很好。它是完全为了普及科学知识而出版的，从这里也可以看出祖国人民向科学进军的情形。
    他们还向记者谈到由于他们要求返回祖国而遭受到美国政府阻难的情形。鲍城志说，他早在1952年就申请回国，却没有得到美国政府的允许。他在1954年，和王祖耆、陈世祜等九个同学，联名写信质问艾森豪威尔为什么不让中国留学生返回自己的祖国。在这封信里说明了他们返回自己的祖国并不妨害美国安全，以驳斥美国政府的借口。这封公开信发表在芝加哥每日新闻等八家报纸上，引起社会舆论同情。因此虽然美国联邦调查局、移民和归化局这类美国政府机关经常派人找他们的麻烦，企图阻碍他们回国，但是他们在坚决返回祖国的正当要求下，终于突破了各种困难返回祖国怀抱。
    和鲍城志一道回国的有：高有焕、裴锡恒、廖山涛、斯重遥。鲍城志在华盛顿大学研究院攻读并任该校电机工程研究员，在美国西北大学电机工程任助教兼研究员，并完成了博士的学程。高有焕在美国纽约西非医院、纽约特保罗医院、新泽西州卜老克胸腔病医院研究胸腔内科病。裴锡恒读完俄亥俄大学工商管理研究院硕士后又在纽约大学研究工商管理。廖山涛就读博士学位于芝加哥大学研究院，学习数学和专修拓扑学。斯重遥读完伊利诺理工学院研究院硕士，在卡内基理工学院冶金研究院读书和在美国锰钢公司研究与制造焊条。
