Premier Pham Van Dong spoke first at the rally.

In his speech, he pointed out that due to decades of heroic struggle, the Vietnamese people have won glorious victories. But the American imperialists and their agents in South Vietnam want to seize these victories, and they are trying to undermine the implementation of the Geneva Accords and the realization of Vietnam's unification through free general elections throughout the country in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords. Therefore, the position of all the Vietnamese people is: 1. The Geneva Accords must be thoroughly implemented. 2. The French government and the Southern regime have joint responsibility for the implementation of the Geneva Accords. They must work together to ensure the continued implementation of the Geneva Accords. 3. The International Commission should continue its activities on the legal basis of the Geneva Accords. The Joint Ceasefire Committee and Liaison Delegation must also conduct activities on the basis of the Geneva Accords. 4. Reconvene the Geneva Conference with the participation of the participating countries of the 1954 Geneva Conference and the three member states of the International Commission to discuss all ways to ensure the continued implementation of the Geneva Accords.

Finally, Pham Van Dong called on all the Vietnamese people to unite closely around the Fatherland Front and strive for victory.

Afterwards, the South Vietnamese representative, Pham Ngoc Thuan, former vice chairman of the Southern Anti-Resistance Administrative Committee, and the workers' representative Nguyen Van Anh, successively spoke at the rally. Next, Hoang Quoc Viet, chairman of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, read out the resolution of the rally.

The mass parade began at a little after seven o'clock. The parade lasted for two hours.

Throughout May 1st, Hanoi will continuously hold sports activities and artistic performances to celebrate the holiday.

More than 60,000 working people in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of the Mongolian People's Republic, held a rally and parade at Sukhbaatar Square on the morning of May 1st to celebrate "May Day" International Labor Day.

The rally was sponsored by the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), the All-Japan Trade Union Congress, and other trade union organizations.
