    Employee Life
    Marching Towards Science
    The Shenyang Water Pump Factory has launched a wave of studying culture, technology, and politics in the advanced producer movement. By the end of April, 85% of the factory's employees had participated in cultural, technical, and political studies.
    Workers with low levels of education are studying culture; those with a certain level of education are participating in technical foundation training classes and advanced worker training classes. Technical personnel, in addition to participating in Russian training classes and design training classes, the factory also hired professors from the Northeast Institute of Technology to regularly lecture them on the scientific theories related to water pump design. Among management cadres, due to the emphasis and personal participation of leaders in learning, the cadre study class, which used to be "three days of fishing, two days of drying nets," has also persisted, with attendance rates frequently reaching 95%.

    Dock Workers' Joy of Moving
    The Hankou Port Authority has built a new dock loading and unloading worker dormitory in the first operating area that can accommodate 1,300 people. In this red building, there are also canteens, tea stations, bathhouses, libraries, and auditoriums. Five brigades of stevedores have already moved into their new homes. Tao Huayuan, a worker who just moved into the new dormitory, said excitedly: "The new building is warm in winter and cool in summer, how comfortable it is! Thinking of the suffering of our dock workers before liberation and the happy life now, my enthusiasm for work is even greater." (Yan Jiamei)
    At the First Automobile Factory Club
    Night fell, and the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant's auto worker club was crowded with workers who had just gotten off work. On May 20th, the workers watched the recently translated Italian film "Rome Eleven O'Clock" here.
    Every night, the auto worker club is open, and workers come here in groups of three or five to rest, chat, play chess, and play cards. The club regularly holds technical exhibitions, literary lectures, and dances, and also frequently invites various troupes from Changchun and other places to perform for the auto workers. In the half year since the club was built, it has screened and performed movies, dramas, Peking opera, Ping opera, Yue opera, and other performances totaling two hundred shows, with an audience of more than 100,000 people.

    The Cafeteria is Satisfactory
    The Taiyuan Paper Mill's employee cafeteria used to be poorly run, and many people went to small restaurants instead of the cafeteria. The factory leaders strengthened the ideological education of the cafeteria staff and organized them to hold eight group meetings in a row to discuss the shortcomings in the cafeteria's work and ways to improve them. All the cooks launched a "five comparisons" competition, comparing variety, saving, and the taste of food. Soon, the staple food increased from the previous six kinds to fifty-five kinds, and the non-staple food increased from the previous four kinds to sixty kinds. The taste and hygiene of the food have also been improved. As a result, this cafeteria has been praised by the employees and rewarded by the leadership.

    职工生活
    向科学进军
    沈阳水泵厂在先进生产者运动中，掀起了一个学文化、学技术和学政治的热潮。到四月底，全厂85％的职工就分别参加了文化、技术和政治学习。
    工人们，文化低的在学习文化；具有一定文化程度的，参加了技术基础轮训班和高级工训练班。技术人员们，除了分别参加俄文训练班和设计训练班以外，工厂还聘请东北工学院的教授定期为他们讲授有关设计水泵的科学理论。在管理干部当中，由于领导人员重视和亲自参加学习，过去“三天打鱼，两天晒网”的干部学习班也坚持下来了，出勤率经常达到95％。

    码头工人乔迁之喜
    汉口港务局在第一作业区新建了一处可以容纳一千三百人居住的码头装卸工人宿舍。在这栋红色的楼房里，还设有食堂、茶站、浴池、图书室和礼堂。现在已经有五个大队的装卸工人搬进了他们的新居。刚搬进新宿舍的工人陶华元兴奋地说：“新楼冬暖夏凉，该是多么舒服啊！想到解放前咱们码头工人受的苦和现在的幸福生活，我的工作劲头越发大了。”（严家美）
    在第一汽车厂俱乐部里
    天黑了，第一汽车制造厂汽车工人俱乐部挤满了刚刚下班的工人。五月二十日工人们在这里观看了最近译制成的意大利影片“罗马十一点钟”。
    每天夜晚，汽车工人俱乐部都要开放，工人们三五成群地来到这里休息，谈天，下棋，打扑克。俱乐部经常举办技术展览会、文艺讲座和跳舞会，还时常邀请长春市各剧团和外地剧团来为汽车工人演出。在俱乐部建成以后的半年时间里，已放映和演出电影、话剧、京剧、评剧、越剧等二百场，观众达十万多人次。（黄洁民）
    食堂办得满意了
    太原造纸厂职工食堂过去办得不好，不少人不到食堂而到小饭铺吃饭。工厂的领导人加强了对食堂工作人员的思想教育，组织他们连续开了八次小组会，讨论了食堂工作中的缺点和改进办法。全体炊事员开展了比花样、比节约、比饭菜滋味等“五比”竞赛。很快地主食由过去的六种增加到五十五种，副食由过去的四种增加到六十种。饭菜味道、卫生等方面也有了改进。这个食堂因此受到了职工们的好评和领导方面的奖励。
