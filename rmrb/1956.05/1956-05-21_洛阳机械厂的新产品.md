    New Products of Luoyang Machinery Factory
    The local state-owned Luoyang Machinery Factory is actively engaged in the trial manufacture of new products. Among these new products are two important machines specially designed for irrigating dry-hard concrete. One is a flexible-shaft high-frequency vibrator, which was successfully trial-manufactured in late April and has been proven fully qualified after testing at local basic construction sites; mass production will begin at the end of May. The other is a concrete vibrating table with a speed of 100 revolutions per second, trial-manufactured according to advanced Soviet experience. Ten units have now completed the electric motor and electric shaft regulator sections, and it is expected that the complete set of machinery will be completed by early June. In addition, a twelve-ton three-wheel road roller for road construction has also completed the drawing arrangement work, and some parts have already been put into production.

    洛阳机械厂的新产品
    地方国营洛阳机械厂正在积极进行新产品的试制工作。这批新产品中有两种专供浇灌干硬性混凝土使用的重要机械。一种是软轴式高频率震动器，在四月下旬试制成功，经过当地基本建设工地试验，证明完全合格；五月底，便可大批生产。另一种是根据苏联先进经验试制的每秒钟转速为一百转的混凝土震动台，现在有十台完成了电动机和电轴调节器部分，预计在六月初可以完成全套机械的试制工作。此外，供修筑道路用的十二吨重的三轮压路机，也已经完成图纸整理工作，部分零件已经投入生产。
