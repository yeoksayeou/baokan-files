Beijing Fully Prepares for Wage Reform

Beijing is comprehensively preparing for wage reform.

The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has formed a special leading body. The Labor Bureau, the Federation of Trade Unions, and the Planning Commission have jointly established a Wage Adjustment Office, responsible for organizing and promoting wage reform throughout the city. Local industry, commerce, transportation, state organs (including culture, education, and health), agriculture, forestry and water conservancy, construction, and municipal administration systems have also separately drawn cadres to establish wage adjustment offices.

These organizations, based on the wage reform plan formulated by the National Wage Conference, have classified wage standards according to different industries, types of work, and departments in each system, and are now uniformly balancing them throughout the city. The specific plan for wage reform in Beijing is expected to be formulated around the 10th and submitted to the central government. In calculating the wage reform plan, each system has fully studied and compared the workers' wages, welfare benefits, and the increase in labor productivity and changes in price index over the years. Local industry and transportation systems are also studying and formulating and revising the technical grade standards for workers and the job wage standards for enterprise management personnel.

　　北京全面进行工资改革准备工作
    北京市正在全面进行工资改革的准备工作。
    中共北京市委员会组成了专门的领导机构，劳动局、工会联合会、计划委员会联合成立了调整工资办公室，负责组织和推行全市工资改革工作。地方工业、商业、交通运输、国家机关（包括文教卫生）、农林水利、建筑、市政等系统也都分别抽调干部，成立了调整工资办公室。
    这些机构根据全国工资会议所拟订的工资改革方案，按各系统不同行业、工种和部门，分类对工资标准进行了研究和测算，现在正在全市范围内统一平衡。北京市工资改革的具体方案预计十日前后可以制定出来，报送中央。在测算工资改革方案中，各系统都结合本市工人工资、生活福利和历年来劳动生产率增长、物价指数变化等情况，作了充分研究和比较。地方工业、交通运输等系统也正在研究制定、修改工人的技术等级标准和企业管理人员的职务工资标准。
