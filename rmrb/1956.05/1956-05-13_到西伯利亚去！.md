    新华社莫斯科12日电　苏联青年响应祖国的号召，申请到西伯利亚和苏联远东地区参加建设工作。
    莫斯科的许多青年最近以来向苏联列宁共产主义青年团莫斯科市委员会和区委员会提出要求派遣的申请。列宁区的区委会已接到几十件这样的申请书。莫斯科大学有许多学生都要求到西伯利亚去。伏龙芝区的科学机关的工作人员也申请到远东地区的第六个五年计划的工地去工作。
    莫斯科州的共青团组织已经收到了几百件申请书，土希诺城的一个建筑工作队全队都要求到苏联东部去工作。建筑队中一个姓马尔库斯的石工要求到布拉次克水电站去工作，他在申请书中写道，我的专业一定能够适合这一伟大的共产主义建设工地的需要。
    此外，基辅、列宁格勒和其他城市也有许多青年提出了到西伯利亚去工作的申请。基辅的一群工艺学校的学生在申请书中写道：我们知道，开发东方的富源，将使我们的祖国更加富强。
