　　The Central Delegation at the Potala Palace
　　By Our Correspondent Lin Gang
　　On the 6th, the Dalai Lama accompanied Chen Yi, head of the Central Delegation, and members of various fraternal ethnic groups on a tour of the Potala Palace. After the visit, Chen Yi said, "The Potala Palace is a great building of the motherland."
　　The Potala Palace stands on a hill of the same name in the northwest of Lhasa. This famous architectural complex of Buddhist art is composed of countless palaces, thirteen stories high, connected layer upon layer, covering half the hillside. Seen from afar, it resembles an ancient castle.
　　The car wound its way up the wide mountain road. Chen Yi and the members of the Central Delegation from various fraternal ethnic groups arrived at the Potala Palace at 10:00 AM. The Dalai Lama and his deputy tutor, the Trijang Rinpoche, welcomed them in front of the "Da Dan Bai Ji" (Auspicious Peace) Hall. The Dalai Lama invited the guests to rest in the living room of his residence and introduced them, saying: The Potala Palace was originally built during the reign of Tibetan King Songtsen Gampo 1,300 years ago. It was greatly expanded during the time of the Fifth Dalai Lama, and later repaired by successive Dalai Lamas, becoming what it is today.
　　The host of the Potala Palace warmly received the friends from afar. The Dalai Lama and the Trijang Rinpoche, the acting Chikhyab Khenpo Lobsang Samten, and the Kalon of the Tibetan local government, Surkhang Wangchen Gelek, accompanied the guests on a tour of the palace. The Potala Palace has countless Buddha halls, scripture halls, and rooms. The Buddha halls are all magnificent. There are tens of thousands of Buddha statues, large and small. The folds of the clothing and the expressions of the Buddha statues are lifelike. The beams, pillars, shrines, and religious implements are all exquisitely carved. Rows of butter lamps are offered in front of the Buddha statues, and the lamas are chanting scriptures. The sounds of bells and drums are incessant. The visitors were deeply interested in the murals on the four walls of the Buddha halls. The content of the murals is mostly stories from the Buddhist scriptures. The murals in the memorial hall of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama depict his religious and political activities throughout his life. One set of murals, using a huge space, depicts the grand occasion of tens of thousands of Tibetan laborers building the Potala Palace at that time. The Dalai Lama explained the content of the murals to Chen Yi and others in detail.
　　Surrounding the main hall are the eight great memorial halls. Each memorial hall has a stupa containing the remains or bones of the successive Dalai Lamas after their nirvana. The stupa of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama is four stories high, covered in gold leaf and inlaid with pearls and jewels. In the memorial hall of the Seventh Dalai Lama, the Dalai Lama introduced to Chen Yi: "The Fifth Dalai Lama politically unified Tibet; the Seventh Dalai Lama made deep achievements in religion." Chen Yi smiled and said to the host, "The Fourteenth Dalai Lama will lead all the Tibetan people to build socialism in their hometown, and the politics and religion of Tibet will both be developed." During the visit, Chen Yi presented hadas to the statues of Shakyamuni and other Buddhas, as well as to the stupas of successive Dalai Lamas.
　　The members of the Central Delegation from various ethnic groups climbed to the highest point of the Potala Palace. The splendid and brilliant golden roof was right in front of them. New prayer flags fluttered on the willow branches around the golden roof. Representatives of all fraternal ethnic groups from all over the country, overlooking the Lhasa plain, saw a sea of green trees, and new buildings expanding around the old city, and everyone praised the beauty and loveliness of Lhasa.

　　中央代表团在布达拉宫
    本报记者  林钢
    达赖喇嘛六日陪同中央代表团团长陈毅和各兄弟民族的团员，参观了布达拉宫。陈毅在参观以后说：“布达拉宫是祖国伟大的建筑。”
    布达拉宫在拉萨市区西北一座同名的山岗上。这座著名的佛教艺术建筑是由无数宫殿组成的，高十三层，层层相接，掩盖半山。远望去俨然一座古代城堡。
    汽车沿着宽阔的山路曲折而上。陈毅和中央代表团各兄弟民族的团员在上午十时来到布达拉宫。达赖喇嘛和他的副经师赤江活佛在“大旦拜吉”（吉祥平安）殿前迎接他们。达赖喇嘛请客人到自己住处的客厅休憩，并且向客人们介绍说：布达拉宫始建于一千三百年前的藏王松赞干布时代，五世达赖时曾大加扩建，后经历世达赖修葺，才成了今天的规模。
    布达拉宫的主人热情地接待了远方来的朋友。达赖喇嘛和赤江活佛，代理机巧堪布洛桑三旦、西藏地方政府噶伦索康·旺清格来等，分别陪同客人们在宫内参观。布达拉宫有数不清的佛殿、经堂和房间。佛殿都很辉煌。大小佛像，数以万计。佛像雕塑的衣褶神态，栩栩如生。梁、柱、神龛和法器用具，全是精工雕镂。一排排酥油灯供奉在佛像前面，喇嘛们在诵经。钟鼓之声，不绝于耳。参观者对于佛殿四壁的壁画感到浓厚的兴趣。壁画的内容，大多是佛经故事。十三世达赖喇嘛祭堂的壁画，绘画着他一生的宗教和政治活动。有一组壁画用巨大的篇幅，表现了数万藏族劳动人民修建布达拉宫当时的盛况。达赖喇嘛向陈毅等人详细讲解了壁画的内容。
    环绕正殿，有八大祭堂。每座祭堂有一佛塔，里面藏有历代达赖?槃后的肉身或骨身。十三世达赖喇嘛的佛塔，有四层楼那么高，全身裹以金叶，满镶珠玉宝石。在第七世达赖喇嘛的祭堂，达赖喇嘛向陈毅介绍说：“五世达赖喇嘛，曾经在政治上统一了西藏；七世达赖喇嘛在宗教上有很深的造就。”陈毅笑向主人说：“第十四达赖喇嘛将要领导全藏人民在自己的家乡建成社会主义，西藏的政治和宗教都将得到发展。”陈毅在参观中，向释迦牟尼等佛像以及历代达赖的佛塔献了哈达。
    中央代表团各民族的团员们，登上了布达拉宫的最高处。灿烂辉煌的金顶，就在眼前。金顶四周的柳枝上飘扬着新的经旗。来自全国各地的各兄弟民族代表，在这里远眺拉萨平原，但见一片绿树的海洋，新的建筑在旧市区周围扩展开来，大家同声赞美拉萨的美丽和可爱。
