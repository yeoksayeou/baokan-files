Developing Amateur Quyi Activities Among Workers
Chen Long

The outstanding programs from the National Workers' Amateur Quyi Performance currently being staged in the capital vividly demonstrate the new achievements in the vigorous development of Quyi, a highly combative art form, in factory and mine amateur activities.

These programs were selected from 196 programs of 82 art forms including crosstalk (相声), Pingtan (评弹), Shandong Kuaishu (山东快书), Qinshu (琴书), Tanci (弹词), Zhuizi (坠子), Lianhualuo (莲花落), and small-scale opera, performed by 503 actors from 26 provinces, autonomous prefectures, municipalities, and industrial systems participating in the performance. Except for a small number of traditional programs, 180 programs reflected the current enthusiastic and fiery real-life struggles, with more than half being created or performed by the workers themselves. These programs sharply depicted the struggle between advanced and backward ideologies in life, enthusiastically praised the beautiful new life, vividly commended the exemplary deeds of advanced figures, and also satirized backward elements in production. Programs like the Pingtan "The Mailman's Honor," the crosstalk "It's Not My Fault," the Shandong Kuaishu "One Hundred Bags of Cement," the Kuai Ban (快板) "Improve Culture," the Jingyun Dagu (京韵大鼓) "Public Security Model Sun Guizhen," and the Jinqianban (金钱板) "Lineworker Li Maoshan," which won creation awards at this performance, are all relatively excellent works.

The positive reception of these works is not only due to the fact that the authors themselves live in the midst of heated real-life struggles and have deep feelings, but also because they simply wrote down the things that moved them, allowing everyone to receive the same education. The Pingtan "The Mailman's Honor" is a good example. One of the authors of this Pingtan is an outstanding mailman himself; therefore, he was able to meticulously and vividly portray his colleague Wang Shenxian, an advanced figure who diligently serves the masses, with his personal experiences and passionate feelings. He captured several small but touching events, depicting Wang Shenxian's responsible attitude and ideological activities towards his work and people at all times and places, vividly presenting this character, who happily works in ordinary labor and is loved by the masses, before the audience. The crosstalk "It's Not My Fault" satirized a careless, sloppy, and irresponsible postal worker who caused losses to his work. These works by worker-amateur authors were all welcomed by the audience.

The common characteristics of Quyi authors among workers are their boundless love for the construction of our country and the advanced figures in construction, and their relentless hatred for backward phenomena. They are generally very simple and lack artificiality. Their creative level will continue to improve on the basis of a deep life foundation and abundant creative enthusiasm.

From the performances, we can see that many outstanding performing talents have emerged among the workers. These amateur Quyi enthusiasts are themselves builders of the new life, deeply understanding the thoughts and feelings of the new figures. They are familiar with the performing methods passed down through the ages and are able to break through the original forms and create something new according to the needs of the new life content. The singer of the Henan Zhuizi (河南坠子) "Singing the Yellow River" is a prominent example in this regard. Although she is only a seventeen-year-old female worker, her hard work and the abundant enthusiasm aroused by the great plan to transform the Yellow River enabled her to skillfully use the traditional techniques of singing Zhuizi to express the painful life of the people on both banks of the Yellow River who have suffered from disasters for many years, and also created new singing styles, fully reflecting the new life content. The actress who played the old lady in "Cooperatives Are Really Better Than Individual Farming" also had a wonderful and unique performance; in particular, she truly and movingly revealed the joyful mood of the individual farmer after joining the cooperative and gradually becoming rich. The singer of the Kuaiban (快板) "One Cent Per Liang of Rice," the Lianzhukuaishu (连珠快书) "Steel Warrior Zhang Weiliang," as well as the performances of certain crosstalk and Pingtan, have approached or reached the professional performance level. Leaders of these units and relevant local departments need to further care for and cultivate such talented actors who have emerged in amateur activities, so that their talents can be better developed.

From the excellent programs of the workers' amateur Quyi performance, we can see the current development of amateur literary and artistic activities of workers across the country, which is truly gratifying. These excellent programs will greatly improve the level of workers' amateur Quyi activities and promote their wider and deeper development.

    在职工群众中开展业余曲艺活动

    正在首都公演的全国职工业余曲艺观摩演出会的优秀节目，集中地体现了曲艺这一富有战斗性的艺术形式在厂矿业余活动中蓬勃开展的新成就。
    这些节目是从参加会演的二十六个省、自治州、市和产业系统的503个演员演出的相声、评弹、山东快书、琴书、弹词、坠子、莲花落、小型戏曲等八十二种艺术形式的196个节目中挑选出来的。会演中除了一小部分传统节目外，有180个节目反映了当前热火朝天的现实斗争生活，其中有一半以上是职工创作或者自编自演的。这些节目尖锐地表现了生活中先进思想同落后思想的斗争；热情地歌颂了美好的新生活；生动地赞扬了先进人物的模范事迹；同时，也嘲讽了生产上的落后分子。像这次演出的获得创作奖的评弹“投递员的荣誉”、相声“都不怨我”、山东快书“一百袋洋灰”、快板“提高文化”、京韵大鼓“治安模范孙桂珍”、金钱板“线路工人李茂山”等都是比较优秀的作品。
    这些作品的获得好评，不仅由于这些作者本人生活在热火朝天的现实斗争中，有着深切的感受，同时也朴实地把这些感动自己的东西写了出来，让大家受到同样教育。评弹“投递员的荣誉”就是一个很好的例子。这篇评弹的一个作者，就是一个出色的投递员；因之，他能以切身的体验和激动的心情，细致而形象地刻划出同行王慎贤这个勤勤恳恳为群众服务的先进人物。他抓住了几个细小的但又是感人的事件，描绘了王慎贤随时随地对工作、对人的负责态度和思想活动，形象地让这一个在平凡劳动中愉快工作、并受到群众爱戴的人物栩栩如生地展现在观众眼前。相声“都不怨我”的作者辛辣地嘲讽了一个粗枝大叶、马马虎虎、不负责任，使工作遭到了损失的邮务人员。职工业余作者的这些作品都受到了观众的欢迎。
    职工中曲艺作者的共同特点，是对我们国家的建设，和建设中的先进人物的无限热爱，和对落后现象的无情憎恨。它们一般地都很朴素，没有矫揉造作的成分。他们的创作水平在深厚的生活基础上、充沛的创作热情中将会不断地提高。
    从演出中，我们可以看到在职工群众中涌现了许多出色的表演人才。这些业余的曲艺爱好者本人，就是新生活的建设者，深刻地体会新人物的思想感情，他们既熟习历代相传的表演方法，又能够根据新的生活内容的需要，突破原有的形式有所创造。这方面成积比较突出的是河南坠子“歌唱黄河”的演唱者，虽然她还不过是一个十七岁的女工，由于她的辛勤劳动，和被改造黄河的伟大规划激起的充沛的热情，使她能够熟练地运用演唱坠子的传统技巧，表现了黄河两岸人民多年受灾害的痛苦生活，更创造了新的唱腔，充分地反映新的生活内容。在“合作社真比单干好”中扮演老太太的演员，也有精彩独到的表演；特别是她把那单干户加入合作社，生活逐渐富裕起来之后的欢欣情绪表露得真实动人。快板“一分钱一两米”的演唱者、连珠快书“钢铁战士张渭良”以及某些相声、评弹的表演，已经接近或者赶上专业的演出水平了。像这样一些在业余活动中涌现出的有才能的演员，需要本单位的领导和地方的有关部门进一步的关心和培养，使他们的才能得到更好的发挥。
    从职工业余曲艺会演的优秀节目里，我们可以看出目前全国职工业余文艺活动的发展面貌，真是令人喜悦。这些优秀节目将使职工的业余曲艺活动水平大大提高，促使它得到更广泛、更深入的开展。
