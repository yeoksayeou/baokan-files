    据新华社新德里9日电  据印度报业托辣斯苏拉特八日消息：由国大党领导的印度全国工会大会年会五月六日开幕。
    参加年会开幕式的有一千多位代表和观察员。全苏工会中央理事会书记普罗索罗夫·瓦西里、中华全国总工会副主席刘宁一，以及其他一些国家的工会代表也应邀参加了这次年会。
    大会在通过了十四项决议之后，已经在五月七日晚上结束。
    大会通过的决议包括拥护印度总理尼赫鲁所提出的新工业政策的决议、关于增加工资的决议、关于劳工参加企业管理的决议等。
    大会在一项决议中向尼赫鲁保证在计划经济中没有罢工和停工的余地，同时又要求各省邦和中央政府公平地执行劳工法律。
    大会对于保险事业国有化表示欢迎。
    印度全国工会大会新当选的主席斯·拉·瓦萨夫达在八日举行了记者招待会。他在谈话中提到了共产党所领导的全印工会大会提出的同印度全国工会大会根据共同的纲领进行合作的建议。他说，共产党人在呼吁劳工实现团结。但是他的工会在实际上同共产党人发生联系并且结成联盟以前将“慎重考虑”。
