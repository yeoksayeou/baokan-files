The preliminary design of the Baotou Iron and Steel Company (hereinafter referred to as Baogang) has recently been finalized.

According to the contents of the preliminary design, Baogang will have dozens of large factories and workshops for mining, beneficiation, sintering, metallurgy, repair, coking, etc. There will be hundreds of construction projects; there will be several hundred independent buildings. The total length of its own railway lines will reach several hundred kilometers. All major workshops (factories), auxiliary workshops, and affiliated workshops will adopt the most advanced technology and equipment. Operation and transportation will maximize the use of electrification, automation, and mechanization. In individual parts, consideration has also been given to the use of the latest scientific achievements - tracer atoms.

After Baogang is fully completed, it will contribute a large amount of high-quality steel to the motherland every year, and fundamentally change the economic outlook of western Inner Mongolia.

Baogang employees and engineering and technical personnel feel proud that the labor of each of them has permeated this most advanced design.

Mining exploration work began as early as 1950. Corresponding to this was the selection of the factory site. Baotou's ore is a rare and special iron ore in the world. Whether it can be smelted into good iron, how to ensure the maximum production of iron and good working conditions, and how to ensure the recovery of other beneficial minerals in the ore. These issues must be tested and data must be provided as a basis for the design. This experiment was a completely new subject for China's most experienced ironmaking engineers. The experiment was first conducted by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. On this basis, Baogang also carried out blast furnace and open hearth furnace test work. For this work, it was necessary to build experimental blast furnaces, and to have the strong help of other brother factories and the guidance of Soviet experts. For this work, it was also necessary to mine a large amount of ore. The miners sometimes had to mine in the severe cold of tens of degrees below zero. Temporarily, there was no mechanical mining and transportation equipment, so the workers used manual mining, and manual labor, cars, and horse-drawn carriages to transport it.

If Baogang uses DC water, it will need to supply dozens of cubic meters of water every second. Although there is a huge water source here - the Yellow River, how much will it cost to turn the Yellow River water, which carries a large amount of sediment, into industrial water, and to send it to the point of use dozens of miles away with a height difference of dozens of meters! It is truly that yellow water is as valuable as gold! Therefore, groundwater should be found. Is there groundwater in this arid grassland? How much? Can it be used? In order to uncover these secrets, drillers and geologists guarded the pumping holes day and night. If one test failed, they would do it again. Supply personnel ran all over the country to find equipment. After more than a year of efforts, although this task has not been finally completed, certain results have been achieved.

In order to provide precise topographic maps and engineering geological data for the design, geological and surveying personnel have traveled all over the mountains and plains of Baotou for the past three years. In winter, they worked in the mines, blizzards covered their eyes, and the severe cold froze their hands and feet. In the spring, they worked in the factory area, and sudden sandstorms slapped their faces, turning them into "earth people." During the flood season, they worked on the turbulent Yellow River rapids, where the river water broke the thick anchor ropes and scattered the rafts! In this team, many commendable models emerged.

Lu Minghao, who attended the National Congress of Advanced Producers' Representatives, led his surveying team to measure 28,000 meters of single-line leveling in a single day, exceeding the quota by 250%, and 18,000 meters of three-wire leveling in a single day, exceeding the quota by 125%. In the rugged mountain survey, they completed 160 days of tasks in sixty days, and there were never any quality rework accidents. Someone asked Lu Minghao why they did their work so well. He replied: "We often think like this: if we finish work one day earlier, Baogang will produce steel one day earlier. When I think of this, my legs are especially strong, and I am more careful, so the speed is faster and the quality is better." Indeed, Lu Minghao spoke the mind of every Baogang builder.

In the work of collecting all preliminary design data, the help of central departments, the help of many enterprises, and the selfless guidance and help of Soviet experts were obtained. In order to review and determine the preliminary design, the president, chief engineer, and experts from all aspects of a certain Soviet ferrous metallurgical design institute personally came to our country, and personally went to the industrial plant site for repeated inspections. The experts' lofty internationalist spirit and superb technical achievements in all the work left the deepest impression on Baogang employees.

The original industrial base of Baotou City was very weak. In order to build the base, a batch of new factories has been rapidly built, including brick and tile, automobile repair, oxygen, power generation, and woodworking factories. Wide cement roads lead to the industrial construction area, and rows of power lines lead to the industrial construction area! An endless stream of trucks, horse-drawn carts, and rickshaws transport huge amounts of building materials to the industrial construction area! In order to build Baogang, the peasants happily sold their beloved land to the country. Mongolian herdsmen, in order to defend their precious mountains, beliefs, and grasslands, once bravely attacked the Japanese invaders' exploration team fifteen years ago. Today, they automatically give up their pastures and precious water to the construction cause.

    在建设中的包头钢铁工业
    宋汉清　房昭文
    包头钢铁公司（以下简称包钢）的初步设计最近确定了。
    根据初步设计的内容，包钢将拥有采矿、选矿、烧结、冶金、修理、焦化等等数十个大工厂和车间。建筑项目要数以百计；独立建筑物达到好几百项。它自己拥有的铁路线总长达到几百公里。各个主要车间（厂）、辅助车间和附属车间，都将采用最先进的技术和装备。操作、运输将最大限度地利用电气化、自动化和机械化。在个别部分，还考虑了利用最新的科学成就——示踪原子。
    包钢全部建成之后，每年将把大量的质地优良的钢铁贡献给祖国，并且从根本上改变内蒙古西部地区的经济面貌。
    包钢职工和工程技术人员觉得自豪的是：在这项最先进的设计中，也渗透着他们每个人的劳动。
    矿山勘探工作远自1950年就开始了。与此相应的是选择厂址。包头的矿石是世界上罕见的特殊铁矿石，它能不能冶炼成良好的铁，怎样保证铁的最大生产量和良好的劳动条件，怎样保证回收矿石中的其他有益矿物。对这些问题，都必须经过试验，提出资料，作为设计的根据。这项试验，对于我国那些最有经验的炼铁工程师来说都是全新的课题。试验是首先由中国科学院进行的，包钢在这一基础上，也先后进行了高炉平炉的试验工作。为了这个工作，需要修建试验高炉，需要有其他兄弟厂的大力帮助和苏联专家的指导。为了这个工作，还需要开采大批矿石。采矿工人们有时候要冒着零下数十度的严寒采矿。暂时还没有机械采矿和运输设备，工人们就用人工开采，用人工、用汽车、马车来运输。
    假若包钢采用直流用水，那么每一秒钟便需要供应数十立方公尺的水。这里虽然有巨大的水源——黄河，但是要把夹带大量泥沙的黄河水变成工业用水，又要把它送到远距数十里高差数十公尺的使用地点，须要付出多少代价！真正是黄水贵如金！因此就应该寻找地下水。在这个干旱的草原上，有地下水吗？有多少？能用吗？为了揭开这些秘密，钻工们和地质人员们，日日夜夜守候着扬水孔，一次试验失败了，再来一次。供应人员们为了找设备，跑遍全国。经过一年多的努力，此项任务虽未最终完成，但已取得一定成绩。
    为了给设计提供精密的地形图和工程地质资料，三年来，地质、测量人员，踏遍了包头的山地和平原。冬季，他们工作在矿山上，暴风雪遮住了眼睛，严寒冻僵了手脚。春天，他们工作在厂区，突然袭来的暴风沙扑打着脸，把他们变成“土人儿”。汛期，他们工作在波浪喧嚣的黄河激流上，河水冲断了粗大的锚索，把木筏冲散！在这个队伍中，涌现了许多值得颂扬的模范。
    出席全国先进生产者代表会议的吕明浩，带领着他的测量小组，曾经日测单线水准二万八千公尺，超过定额250％，日测三丝水准一万八千公尺，超过定额125％。在崎岖的矿山测量中，他们六十天完成一百六十天的任务，而且从未发生质量返工事故。有人问吕明浩，为什么他们工作做得这样好的时候，他回答说：“我们常这样想：我们早完一天工，包钢就能早出一天钢。一想起这，腿特别有劲，也越加用心，速度就快了，质量就好了。”确实，吕明浩说出了每个包钢建设者的思想。
    在全部搜集初步设计资料的工作中，得到了中央各部门的帮助，得到了许多企业单位的帮助，也得到苏联专家无私的指导和帮助。为了审查并确定初步设计，苏联某黑色冶金设计院院长、总工程师和各方面的专家都亲自赶到我国来，而且亲自到工业厂地反复考察。专家们在全部工作中的崇高的国际主义精神和精湛的技术成就，留给包钢职工以最深刻的印象。
    包头市原来的工业基础是很薄弱的。为了建设基地，一批新的工厂已经迅速建设起来，其中包括砖瓦、汽车修理、氧气、发电、木器等工厂。宽阔的水泥公路通向工业建筑区，一排排的电线通向工业建筑区！川流不息的卡车、马车、人力车把数量庞大的建筑材料运到工业建筑区！为了建设包钢，农民们把心爱的土地欢欢喜喜地卖给国家。蒙族牧民们，为了保卫自己的宝山、信仰和草地，曾经在十五年前英勇的袭击过日本侵略者的勘探队，今天他们却自动地把牧场和宝贵的水让给建设事业。
