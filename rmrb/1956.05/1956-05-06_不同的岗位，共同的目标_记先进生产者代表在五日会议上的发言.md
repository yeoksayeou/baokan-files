　　Different Positions, Common Goal
    -- A Record of Speeches by Advanced Producer Representatives at the Five-Day Conference
    Rich content and enthusiastic atmosphere remained the characteristics of yesterday's meeting of the National Advanced Producers Representatives Conference. Yesterday, the entire venue welcomed with rounds of applause the speeches of eleven advanced individuals from various construction fronts of the motherland. They included a tractor driver from the vast forests of the Yichun Forestry Area in the Northeast, an excavator operator from the construction site of Anshan Iron and Steel, a female sales clerk from a bookstore, agricultural and medical science workers, a lathe operator from a machine factory who completed their five-year individual workload two years ahead of schedule, a female road construction team leader from a minority nationality in the Southwest border, a demobilized soldier devoted to the pig farming industry, a foreman of a blast furnace, a trade union worker from a construction site, and a pioneer of railway construction - a representative of the Railway Engineering Corps. ... They introduced their various experiences and achievements to the conference.
    Tractor Driver in the Great Forest
    Two demobilized soldiers spoke at yesterday's meeting: Li Xiaoxue, a tractor driver from the Yichun Forestry Area, and Pan Rui, director of the No. 1 Warehouse of the Yunnan Provincial Company of the China Food Company and a pig farming expert. They continued to carry forward the fine tradition of the People's Liberation Army of not fearing hardship and made excellent achievements in their new positions. Li Xiaoxue learned the technology of driving a tractor in a short period of time. He said: As a driver, maintaining the attendance rate of the vehicle, caring for every part of the vehicle, constantly wiping and oiling it, and not allowing it to have any wear or collision, is not only my glorious duty but also the key to ensuring the completion of the task. I often get up at two o'clock in the morning to help my assistant preheat the engine, check the parts, and make all preparations before departure. We have become familiar with the working conditions and specific capabilities of each part of the vehicle, and we never "drive up the mountain as soon as we can get it started," so that the vehicle maintains normal operation during work, "does not act up, and does not get sick." We also have to check it once at noon every day. After returning the vehicle in the evening, we will not go to rest no matter how tired we are until we have inspected it and wiped it clean. This three-inspection system every day has greatly helped us and kept our vehicles very healthy. Because we cherish the vehicle, the national requirement for the attendance rate is 85%, but our No. 4049 tractor has reached 98%. Because we attach importance to maintaining the vehicle, important parts of the vehicle such as the "towing hook" and "bumper" are still very new. In this way, we have ensured over-fulfilling the production tasks in each period. In the winter of 1953, we created the highest production record of timber harvesting tractors in the entire Yichun Forestry Area. The entire team maintained safe production throughout the 116 days of work and did not have any mechanical or personal accidents. Our No. 4049 tractor has not lost a single piece of timber in the mountain area where it has worked. After learning from Li Xian'an's experience in transporting treetop wood, we also made some improvements based on the actual situation, and the result was three times higher than the original carrying effect, and the accident of damaging the vehicle's loading board was eliminated.
    Excellent Bookstore Saleswoman
    Niu Futing, a saleswoman from the Harbin Branch Bookstore of the Heilongjiang Provincial Xinhua Bookstore who spoke at yesterday's meeting, is a young woman of twenty-two years old. She wholeheartedly serves the readers and has thought of many ways to get books and newspapers into their hands. In order to do a good job in the distribution of magazines, she recorded the readers' magazine purchasing situation: what day and time each magazine arrived? When was it sold out? After it was sold out, which readers came to buy it again? Their names, addresses, and telephone numbers were also recorded; at the same time, she also checked all magazines every day, recorded how many of each magazine was sold in the first few days and how many were sold in the last few days; then she calculated the average, so that she could gradually understand the law of readers' needs for each magazine. Basically, the situation of magazine backlog and out of stock was overcome. The sales volume of each magazine has increased by one or two times compared to the original.
    Later, she was transferred to work in the literary group of the first sales department, and she had to manage nearly two thousand kinds of books, with more than two hundred kinds of new books arriving every month. First, she began to memorize the titles of the books and remember the placement of the books. When there were not many readers, she would look at each rack in order, to see what books were placed on each rack. Sometimes she would also actively ask comrades to quiz her. Secondly, she learned the classification. According to the order of the classification signs on the bookshelves, she gradually understood what books were placed under each classification sign, and why they were placed that way.
    Although she was familiar with the titles of the books, she still did not understand the contents of the books. If the kind of book that the reader wanted was not available, she could not introduce similar books to the reader; and some books had good content, but because the cover was not good-looking, or the title of the book was not well-known, no one bought them, and she could not introduce them because she did not understand the contents of the books. At this time, she had to become familiar with the contents of the books and actively recommend them to the readers. She first read the preface and postscript of best-selling books, and also asked comrades to explain the books that she did not understand or could not comprehend. Through these methods, she is now familiar with the contents of more than one hundred and fifty literary books. Later, she adopted the method of introducing different books to different readers and actively finding readers according to the contents of the books to meet the needs of the readers. In the fourth quarter of last year, she used this method to introduce more than one thousand five hundred books to readers. In this way, the relationship with readers became closer and closer, and more and more readers became familiar with her. Now she maintains close contact with nearly eighty readers in various units.
    "Working to Eliminate Locust Plagues"
    Qiu Shibang, a researcher at the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, was the first representative of scientific workers to speak at the meeting. He specializes in studying locusts. His speech aroused great interest among the representatives. He said: "In the summer of 1951, I was still studying in the United Kingdom. When I saw in the newspaper that the motherland was using airplanes to control locusts, I was extremely excited. In our country, locust plagues have occurred more than eight hundred times in the past two thousand six hundred years. The locust problem, which has never been completely solved in history, now has hope of being solved. Therefore, I decided to return to the country as soon as possible to contribute my share of strength." In 1952, he investigated the main locust outbreak bases in Hebei and Shandong provinces, participated in the field control of locusts, and personally witnessed the Party and the government actively leading the masses to fight against natural disasters, which deeply moved him.
    He said: In my actual work, I feel it is necessary to establish a set of locust forecasting and early warning system, and vigorously carry out mass reconnaissance work. After studying the technology of scouting locusts, and studying the identification of more than a dozen kinds of native locusts that often occur mixed with migratory locusts in locust areas in various stages, we proposed the "three checks" method. This method requires fixed personnel in the locust area to conduct reconnaissance work in fixed areas and sections according to certain inspection methods for a long time. The content of the "three checks" is to check eggs, check nymphs, and check adult locusts. The implementation of this set of measures can scientifically grasp the locust situation, predict the occurrence and development of locusts, and carry out prevention and control work in a planned manner. We made a suggestion to the Ministry of Agriculture, which was supported, and we assisted Shandong Province in establishing and training the first long-term locust reconnaissance organization of one thousand people in the Bohai Bay locust area of Shandong Province, which played a significant role in the prevention and control of locusts. In 1953, this experience was widely promoted throughout the country. Now, there are long-term reconnaissance organizations in all locust areas, and the "three checks" method has been universally implemented in locust areas across the country, basically reversing the passive and unplanned situation of locust control work in the past.
    In response to the problem of insufficient supply of pesticides and powder sprayers, we proposed the method of "poison bait to control locusts." Before 1952, the prevention and control of migratory locusts all used "666" powder, and each mu of land generally sprayed three jin of 0.5% "666" powder. After switching to poison bait, each mu of land used less than five liang of 0.5% "666" powder. Therefore, the "666" powder that was originally only enough to control one mu of locusts can now control ten mu of land, expanding the pesticide control area by ten times. Because the method of poison bait to control locusts saves medicine, saves labor, saves money, and does not require any equipment compared to the method of spraying powder, it is very popular among the masses. The promotion of poison bait not only added an economical and effective method to the prevention and control of migratory locusts, but also found a prevention and control method for soil locusts that seriously harm wheat seedlings and were previously impossible to deal with. Now, all locust areas across the country have universally adopted the method of poison bait to control locusts, and this method has become one of the main methods of locust control. In the past, the method of spreading bait used manpower, and one day's work could only control forty to fifty mu of land. Now, we have developed a power poison bait spreader, which is expected to spread poison bait on one thousand five hundred to two thousand mu per day. This machine will participate in the field control of locusts in Hebei Province this year.
    The Female Captain Who Built the "Liberation Road"
    Zhang Dinan, a girl of the Yunnan Huayao nationality wearing bright national costumes, reported on her deeds of participating in the construction of the Jianjiang Highway at the meeting. Zhang Dinan is from Fangzhang Village, Longwu County, Yunnan Province. She said: Our place used to be a very remote place, and transportation was very difficult. Transportation relied entirely on caravans, and it took one or two days to run to buy some salt, and we also had to take silver dollars to buy it. In 1951, the state was going to build a highway there. We were extremely happy when we heard the news. Many people actively responded to the government's call to participate in road construction, and I also signed up to participate. At first, my mother did not agree, because she had participated in road construction in the old society, and she had to bring her own food to eat, and she would also be beaten and scolded. I explained to my mother that it is different now, this is building our "Liberation Road." At first, I participated in the construction of the Kunluo Highway. At that time, I was only sixteen years old, and the construction site environment was relatively difficult. In addition to road construction, everything had to be done by ourselves, so I organized female workers to help male workers sew and mend clothes, take care of the sick, wash clothes for the patients, dig toilets, and improve environmental sanitation. We also carried stones and dug soil like the male workers. During work breaks, everyone would dance and sing together. Many migrant workers saw us like this and became more active in their work. I slowly learned Chinese, and often told everyone what the leaders said through the national language. Everyone gradually realized the significance of building the highway, and the idea of going home gradually stabilized. Everyone trusted me very much and was willing to approach me, and they elected me as the deputy squad leader.
    There were more than one hundred and sixty people in our squad, including five ethnic groups: Huayao, Hani, Yi, Dai, and Han. In the old society, because they were instigated by reactionaries, they hated each other and often fought. At this time, they worked together on the construction site, but they could not get along for a while. They rarely spoke to each other, and they quarreled in meetings. If one sentence was not right, they would fight. The squad leader and I talked to them individually, explaining that ethnic disunity was caused by reactionaries, and we exposed a bad element who was causing trouble in the squad at the time, and guided everyone to trace the roots of their suffering. From then on, the estrangement between the migrant workers of various ethnic groups gradually disappeared. Subsequently, I went to work in other group's work teams, lived with them, and helped them solve difficulties in their work. In this way, several ethnic groups slowly became united like a family, and they no longer quarreled or fought. The work efficiency was improved. When we were building the Gejin Highway in 1954, I was promoted to the position of company commander. At the end of 1954, our team was rated as a model company.
    I have participated in the construction of three highways. The happiness that the highways have brought to our ethnic minorities is endless. Automobiles transport various industrial products, daily necessities, and salt to our doorstep, and transport our local products such as peanuts, deer antler, tiger skin, and medicinal materials out; electric lights, movies, radios, etc., which we had never seen before, are now seen; in the past, we could not afford to raise a baby, but now we can go to school; the lives of the people of all ethnic groups are getting better day by day. Calico, silk thread, etc., can be bought conveniently and cheaply, and men, women, old and young are all dressed up. Many people say: "The more we live, the younger we get."
    "Turning Pigpen Director"
    The vivid speech of Pan Rui, a demobilized soldier and director of a pig warehouse, won applause from the audience. He introduced many interesting pig farming methods. He said: At one time, in the pig warehouse where I worked, the rate of sick and dead pigs was over 40%. The pigs that were neither sick nor dead were fed dozens of pounds of food every day, but not only did they not get fat, but they got thinner and thinner. I was very strange, what is the reason for this? So I began to pay attention. I found that each feeder in our warehouse had a large stick, which they carried with them at all times, and often beat the pigs until they screamed strangely, which made my heart ache. I said to a feeder: "Pigs don't understand anything, don't beat them." Unexpectedly, he rolled his eyes at me and said: "What do you know? Pigs can't be beaten!" Not long after, I went to visit the Wuhan Frozen Meat Processing Factory, and I learned that sticks hit the pigs, leaving scars, and affecting the quality of the pork. After I came back, I told the feeders not to beat them anymore. They saw that I didn't understand the business and didn't listen to me. I got angry, got up in the middle of the night, and burned all the sticks. When they found out, they all scolded me and said: "The pigs are not your parents, why can't they be beaten?" I said: "Pigs are not my parents, but they are the property of the people." On the one hand, I told them that beating them like this would injure the pigs, which would affect the quality of the pork and exports. On the other hand, I managed more than one hundred pigs myself without using sticks, which reversed the trend of beating pigs.
    Our warehouse could only hold more than one thousand pigs, but in early 1954, more than seven thousand pigs were suddenly transported in, and the warehouse was crowded inside and out. Due to poor management and the lack of a sound system, coupled with the small number of people and the small space, thousands of pigs rolled in the mud, water, and manure, resulting in a large number of deaths. The most was 126 deaths in one day. The residents around the warehouse were very angry when they saw this situation and scolded me as the "dead pig director." At that time, I really had no way. Seeing the pigs die in batches, I was so anxious that I cried. I discussed with the staff to find ways to save the situation, such as increasing feeding equipment, laying floors, and laying straw. After many efforts, the leaders increased the number of cadres and allocated funds to build pigpens, and the serious phenomenon of dead pigs was reversed. From then on, I often turned around in the pigpen. People called me the "Turning Pigpen Director." I not only looked in the pigpen, but also worked with everyone. If I didn't understand, I asked, and I slowly became familiar with the business. I saw that the pigs always fought when they entered the pen, often breaking their heads and bleeding. Once, I had just gone to bed, and the pigs started biting each other. If no one went to shout at them, they would keep biting each other, so the pigs would not get any rest. People get sick if they don't sleep well, and of course pigs are the same. I got up and shouted, but as soon as I turned around, they bit again. I thought to myself: "Why are they fighting? How can I stop them from biting?" To study this issue, I squatted in a dark corner and secretly observed for several days in a row. After studying with my comrades, I found the reason for the fighting. It turned out that the pigs from different places had different personalities. Some pigs grew up in the mountains, were impatient, and loved to fight. Local pigs were timid and afraid of people. Fat pigs couldn't run, slept after eating, and piglets were like children, mischievous, so they would cause friction. Based on this discovery, we kept the pigs from different regions separately, and they no longer fought. Although the pigs who liked to fight still had to fight when they were together, they "met their match," and they stopped fighting after a while.
    Later, I often studied with the comrades in other warehouses on how to reduce sick and dead pigs. Cao Denggao, who has been in the pig business for more than twenty years, told me a Hunan dialect saying: "A clean pen and full food are the key to growing meat." It means that if the place where the pigs live is clean, they sleep well, and they eat well, the pigs can grow well. At that time, our warehouse was so dirty, you could smell the stench from a mile away. The pig manure in the pigpen was piled up thickly, and the pigs rolled in the manure all day long. No one knew when the pigs got infectious diseases, and they were not pulled out until several of them died. How could they not die or get sick? I mobilized all the feeders to clean the pigpen, and I took the lead in taking off my shoes and socks, rolling up my sleeves, and cleaning the pig manure. The pigpen was often disinfected, and the cleaning time was also set. From then on, the smell in our warehouse was lighter.
    In the pigpen, I often saw that the pigs were not full and their stomachs were shriveled. Sometimes the pigs ate a few mouthfuls in the trough and walked away wagging their tails. What is the reason for this? People often can't eat their fill because the food doesn't suit their taste. Could this be the reason for the pigs? Later, I saw the food that the pigs liked to eat, grabbed some and put it in my mouth to taste. I also tasted some of the food that the pigs didn't like. After tasting it several times, I knew that the pigs liked to eat things with a sweet taste, and they didn't eat things that were sour or bitter. I studied with the comrades who cooked the food, and often cooked the pig food with a slightly sweet taste. When the pigs saw this food, they all nodded and clapped their ears and ate their stomachs round and round.
    Through the efforts of all our comrades, the mortality rate and sick pigs in our warehouse have been reduced. In the second half of 1954, we found for the first time that the pigs grew meat. This had never happened in the warehouse before. In 1955, our warehouse received more than 160,000 pigs throughout the year, grew more than 700,000 jin of meat, which means that each pig grew more than one jin of meat per day, and increased the wealth of the country by more than 260,000 yuan. If it is exported, it can be exchanged for more than 19,000 tons of steel. Only twenty-five pigs died throughout the year. This year, so far, not a single pig has died. Each pig grows one jin and four liang of meat per day. Seeing that pig farming makes such a great contribution to the country, I don't want to leave the pig warehouse anymore. I want to do it for a lifetime.
    Developing the Motherland's Medical Heritage
    Zhu Longyu, the creator of electroacupuncture therapy and a teacher in the electroacupuncture therapy teaching and research section of Xi'an No. 1 Health School in Shaanxi Province, introduced the process of creating electroacupuncture therapy at yesterday's meeting. He said: In 1951, the People's Daily serialized several articles on "Acupuncture Therapy." At this time, I was studying anatomy, but it aroused my great interest in learning acupuncture therapy. In order to truly understand the role of acupuncture, I first did acupuncture experiments on myself. Soviet scholars have used electrical anesthesia and electrical hypnosis. So I wanted to add an electric current to the needle, hoping to produce this effect. I reported this intention to the leaders, and the Party and the administration immediately supported this opinion, and the comrades also enthusiastically helped me do the experiment. In 1953, funds were allocated, and a dozen staff members were transferred to establish the Electroacupuncture Therapy Research Office at Xi'an Health Cadre School. With the support of the Party and the assistance of the masses, we have created several types of electric therapy machines in the past two years, such as low-frequency, high-frequency, unipolar high-frequency, and direct current electroacupuncture machines. Zhu Longyu said: The test results proved that the effect of electroacupuncture therapy can treat: seven types of diseases in the nervous, digestive, respiratory, urinary and reproductive, muscle and joint rheumatism, skin diseases, and mental illness, etc., including more than seventy diseases. Judging from the cases of treating one thousand eight hundred people, the effective rate reached more than 86%, of which the cure rate accounted for 37%. In terms of economic significance, taking the treatment of mental illness as an example, the effect of electroacupuncture is almost equal to that of insulin therapy, while the cost of insulin for one patient is about 300 yuan or more, and the electricity cost for electroacupuncture is at most 2 yuan and 10 cents. In terms of academic significance, clinical treatment shows that electroacupuncture can not only treat functional diseases, but also treat certain organic diseases.
    At yesterday's meeting, the speeches of other representatives were also very vivid and wonderful. The enthusiasm for socialist construction was always filled in the vast conference hall.

　　不同的岗位，共同的目标
    ——记先进生产者代表在五日会议上的发言
    内容丰富，情绪热烈，依然是全国先进生产者代表会议昨天会议上的特色。昨天，全场以一次次的掌声，欢迎了十一位来自祖国各个建设战线上的先进分子的发言，他（她）们有东北伊春林区大森林里的拖拉机手，有鞍钢建筑工地上的挖土机司机，有书店的女营业员，有农业、医药科学工作者，提前两年完成五年个人工作量的机器厂车工，有西南边疆少数民族的女筑路队长，献身养猪事业的复员军人，炼铁高炉的工长，建筑工地上的工会工作者，以及铁路建设的先锋——铁道兵团的代表。……他（她）们向大会介绍了他们的各种经验和成就。
    大森林里的拖拉机手
    昨天会上发言的有二位复员军人，一位是伊春林区的拖拉机手李小学；一位是中国食品公司云南省公司第一仓库主任、养猪能手潘瑞。他们继续发扬了人民解放军不怕艰难的优良传统，在新的岗位上做出了优良的成绩。李小学在不长的时间里就学会了驾驶拖拉机的技术。他说：做为一个驾驶员，保持机车的出勤率，爱护机车的每一个部件，经常的擦洗、上油，不让它有一点磨损或碰撞，不但是自己的光荣职责，也是保证完成任务的关键。我经常早晨两点钟起床，帮助助手烤车，检查部件，作好出车前的一切准备工作。我们做到了熟悉机车每个部分的工作情况和具体能力，决不“能开走就上山”，使机车在工作中保持正常运转，“不耍脾气，不闹病”。每天中午，我们还要检查一次。晚上收车后，不检查一遍，不把机车擦得亮亮的，就是再累，我们也决不去休息。这个每天三检的制度，大大的帮助了我们，使我们的机车一直很健康。由于我们爱护机车，国家要求的出勤率是85％，而我们的4049号拖拉机，却达到了98％。因为我们重视保养机车，机车上的重要部件“牵引钩”和“保险杠”等直到如今还很新。这样，我们每个时期都保证了超额完成生产任务。1953年冬，我们创造了全伊春林区集材拖拉机最高的生产纪录。全组在116天的工作中，一直保持了安全生产，没有发生任何机械和人身事故。我们的4049号拖拉机工作过的山场上，没丢过一根木材。我们在学习了李先安运梢头木的经验之后，又结合实际情况做了一些改进，结果比原来的载运效果提高三倍，并且消灭了压坏机车搭载板的事故。
    优秀的书店女营业员
    昨天会上发言的黑龙江省新华书店哈尔滨支店门市部营业员牛福亭，是一个二十二岁的年轻姑娘。她全心全意地为读者服务，想了许多办法把书报送到他们手里。为了做好杂志的发售，就把读者买杂志的情况记下来，每种杂志哪一天、几点钟来的？什么时候卖完的？卖完了以后又有哪些读者来买？把他们的姓名、地址、电话号码也记下来；同时她又每天把所有杂志点一点，记下来每种杂志头几天销多少，后几天销多少；然后平均算一下，这样大体上就可以逐步了解每种杂志读者需要的规律。基本上克服了杂志积压和脱销的情况。每种杂志销售量都比原来增加了一两倍。
    后来她调到第一门市部文艺小组工作，一个人要经管着近两千多种书籍，每月新到的书就有二百多种。首先她开始背诵书名和记住书的摆放位置。读者不多的时候，就挨着次序看，看每个架子上放的是什么书。有时还主动地请同志们来考问。其次又学习了分类。按着书架上的分类牌的次序，逐格地了解在各分类牌下都放的是什么书，以及为什么那样放。
    虽然书名是熟悉了，但对书籍内容还是不了解，如果读者要的那种书没有了，就不能介绍同类的书给读者；还有的书内容很好，但由于封面不好看，或者书名不响亮，就没人买，而自己也由于不了解书籍内容就无法介绍。这时，还得熟悉书的内容，向读者主动推荐。她首先看畅销书的前言后记，同时还请同志们给讲不了解或领会不了的书籍。通过这些方法，现在她已经熟悉了一百五十多种文艺书的内容了。以后，又采用了对不同的读者介绍不同书籍和根据书籍内容主动去找读者的办法，来满足读者的需要。去年第四季度，就用这种办法，向读者介绍了一千五百多册。这样和读者的关系越来越密切，熟悉的读者越来越多。现在她和各单位近八十名读者保持着密切联系。
    “为扑灭蝗灾而工作”
    华北农业科学研究所研究员丘式邦，是会议上第一个发言的科学工作者代表。他是专门研究蝗虫的。他的发言引起代表们很大的兴趣。他说：“1951年的夏天，我还在英国留学。当我看到报纸上刊登着祖国用飞机治蝗的消息时，我真是兴奋极了。我国两千六百多年来曾经发生过八百多次蝗灾，历史上从来没有彻底解决过的蝗虫问题，现在有了解决的希望。因此我决定及早回国，来供献出我的一分力量”。1952年，他调查了河北和山东两省的主要飞蝗发生基地，参加了实地防治蝗虫的工作，亲眼看到了党和政府积极领导群众和自然灾害作斗争的情形，使他深深地受到感动。
    他说：我在实际工作中感到有必要建立一套蝗虫的预测预报制度，大力开展群众性的侦查工作。我们在研究了侦查蝗虫的技术，研究了蝗区经常和飞蝗混合发生的十几种土蝗的各期的识别以后，提出了“三查”的办法。这办法要求在蝗区内固定专人，分区分片，按照一定的检查方法，长期进行侦查工作。“三查”的内容是查卵、查蝻和查成虫。实行这一套措施，可以科学地掌握蝗情，预知蝗虫的发生和发展，有计划地开展防治工作。我们向农业部作了建议，得到了支持，就在山东省的渤海湾蝗区协助该省建立和训练了我国第一个一千个人的长期侦查蝗虫的组织，对防治蝗虫起了显著的作用。1953年全国普遍推广了这一经验，现在各蝗区都有长期侦查的组织，“三查”办法已在全国蝗区普遍实施，基本上扭转了过去治蝗工作被动、没有计划的局面。
    针对药剂和喷粉器供应不足的问题，我们提出了“毒饵治蝗”的办法。1952年以前防治飞蝗全部采用“666”粉剂，每亩地一般喷0.5％“666”粉三斤，改用毒饵后，每亩所用的0.5％“666”粉还不到五两，因此原来只够防治一亩地蝗虫的“666”粉，现在可以防治十亩地，扩大了药剂防治面积十倍。由于毒饵治蝗方法比喷粉方法省药、省工、省钱，不需要任何器械，很受群众的欢迎。毒饵的推行不仅在防治飞蝗方面多了一种经济有效的办法，并且对危害麦苗严重、过去没有办法对付的土蝗也找到了防治办法。现在全国各蝗区已经普遍采用了毒饵治蝗的方法，这个方法已成为治蝗的主要方法之一了。撒饵的方法过去都用人力，一个日工只能防治四十到五十亩地，现在我们已经制成了一架动力毒饵撒布机，预计一天可以撒毒饵一千五百到二千亩。这架机器今年将参加河北省的实地治蝗。
　　修筑“翻身路”的女队长
    身穿鲜艳的民族服装的云南花腰族姑娘张地囡，在会上报告了她参加修筑建疆公路的事迹。张地囡是云南省龙武县方丈村花腰族人。她说：我们那里从前是个很偏僻的地方，交通也很困难，运输全靠马帮，买点盐巴要跑一两天的路，还要拿银元去买。1951年，国家要在那里修筑公路。我们听见这个消息喜欢极了。很多人积极响应了政府的号召，参加修路，我也报名参加了。起初，妈妈不答应，因为她在旧社会时参加过修路，自己要带粮食吃，还要挨打受骂。我向妈妈解释，现在不同了，这是修我们的“翻身路”。最初，我参加修昆洛公路。当时才十六岁，工地环境比较艰苦，除了修路以外，什么事都得自己干，我就组织女工，帮助男工缝补衣服，照顾病号，替病人洗衣服，挖厕所，搞好环境卫生。我们还和男工一样的抬石头、挖土等。工余的时间，大家就在一起跳舞唱歌。好多民工看见我们这样，干活也积极起来。我慢慢地学会了汉话，常常把领导上说的话，通过民族语言讲给大家听。大家逐渐认识了修公路的意义，想回家的思想慢慢稳定下来。大家都很相信我，愿意接近我，选我当了副分队长。
    我们这个分队有一百六十多人，包括五种民族：花腰族、哈尼族、彝族、傣族、汉族。在旧社会因为受反动派的挑拨离间，互相仇视，时常打架斗殴。这时，在工地上一起干活，一时也合不起来，平常很少说话，开会就争吵，一句话不对头，就打起架来。我和分队长找他们个别谈话，说明民族不团结是反动派造成的，并且揭发了一个当时在分队内挑事的坏分子，引导大家追根诉苦。从此，各族民工的隔阂逐渐消除了。随后，我又到别的组的工作班里干活，和他们生活在一起，帮助他们解决工作上的困难，这样，几个民族慢慢团结的好像一家人，再不争吵打架了。工作效率就提高了。1954年修个金公路的时候，我被提拔担任中队长。1954年底我们队被评为模范中队。
    我先后参加修建了三条公路。公路修通后，给我们少数民族带来的幸福是说不完的。汽车把各种各样的工业品、日用品以及盐巴等运到我们的大门口，把我们当地出产的花生、鹿茸、虎皮、药材等运出去；过去没有见过的电灯、电影、收音机等等，现在都见到了；过去生个娃娃养不起，现在可以上学校；各族人民的生活一天比一天好起来。花布、丝线等等，很方便、很便宜的就可买到，男女老幼都打扮起来，许多人都说：“越活越年轻了。”
    “转猪栏主任”
    复员军人、生猪仓库主任潘瑞的生动发言，博得了全场的掌声。他介绍了许多有趣的养猪方法。他说：有一个时候，我工作的生猪仓库里，病猪、死猪率在40％以上。不病不死的猪，天天喂它吃几十斤的食，可是，它不但不胖，反而越吃越瘦。我很奇怪，这是什么道理呢？我就开始注意起来。我发现我们仓库每个饲养员都有一根大棍子，随时带在身上，常常把猪子打得怪叫，这使我很心痛。我对一个饲养员说：“猪又不懂什么，不要打吧。”不料他朝我翻翻眼说：“你懂什么，猪不打是不行的！”不久，我到武汉冻肉加工厂去参观，才知道棍子打在猪身上，便留下一条条的伤痕，并且影响猪肉的质量。回来后，我就叫饲养员别再打了。他们见我不懂业务，不听我的话。我生了气，半夜爬起来，把棍子统统烧掉了。他们知道了，都骂我说：“猪又不是你的爸，为什么打不得？”我说：“猪不是我的爸，可是人民的财产呀。”我一方面告诉他们，这样打，把猪打伤了，就要影响猪的质量和出口。另一方面，我自己不用棍子也管了一百多头猪，这样才扭转了打猪的风气。
    我们仓库只能关一千多头猪，可是1954年初，忽然一次运来了七千多头，弄得仓库里里外外都挤满了。由于管理不善，缺乏健全的制度，加之人少地方小，几千头猪在泥里、水里、粪里打滚，结果发生了大量死亡。最多的一天死了126头。仓库周围的居民看到这种情形，都很气愤，骂我是“死猪主任”。当时，我真没办法，看见猪一批批死去，急得直哭，我就同职工群众研究商量挽救的办法，如增加饲养设备、铺地板、垫稻草等，经过多次努力，和领导上给我们增加了干部，拨款造了猪栏，严重的死猪现象才算扭转了。从此，我就常常在猪栏转。人家都叫我是“转猪栏主任”。我不但在猪栏内看，而且和大家一齐干，不懂的就问，慢慢就熟悉了业务。我看到猪进了栏老是咬架，常常咬得头破血流。有一次，我刚睡下去，猪就吱哩哇啦的咬起来了，要是人不去喝一声，它们会一直咬个不停，这样，猪就得不到休息。人睡不好觉要生病，猪当然也是一样。我起来就去喝了一声，但我一转身它们又咬了。我在心里琢磨：“为什么要咬架呢？怎样能叫它们不咬呢？”为了研究这个问题，我蹲在黑角落里偷偷地观察，接连看了好几天，经过和同志们共同研究，找出了咬架的原因。原来各地方的猪性格不同，有的猪是在山上长大的，性情急躁，爱打架，本地猪胆小怕人。胖猪跑不动，吃了要睡，小猪像小孩子，死调皮，所以要闹磨擦。根据这个发现，我们把猪按地区不同分别关开，它们就不咬架了，吃了食能安安静静的休息。爱打架的猪在一起虽然还要打，但它们“棋逢对手”，打一会就不打了。
    后来，我又经常和人家仓库里的同志一齐研究，怎样减少病猪、死猪。搞了二十多年生猪业务的曹登高，告诉我一句湖南土话：“栏干食饱，长肉活宝”。意思就是猪住的地方干净，睡得好，吃得饱，猪就能长得好。那时，我们仓库里脏得一塌糊涂，一里以外就能闻到臭味。猪栏里猪粪堆的老厚，猪子一天到晚在粪里打滚。猪得了传染病，也没人知道，死了好几头才把它们拉出来。这怎么能叫它不死、不病呢？我动员所有的饲养员，把猪栏打扫清洁，我自己带头，脱掉鞋袜，卷起袖子，打扫猪粪，猪栏里常常消毒，又规定了扫除的时间。从此，我们仓库的臭味就轻了。
    我在猪栏里，常看见猪子吃不饱，肚子是瘪的，有时猪在食槽里吃了几口，就摇着尾巴走了，这是什么道理呢？人常常因为饭菜不投口而吃不饱。猪是不是这个原因呢？以后，我看见猪喜欢吃的食，抓点放在自己嘴里尝尝，猪不喜欢吃的，也弄点尝尝。尝了几次，知道猪喜欢吃有甜味的东西，酸的、苦的它不吃。我和煮食的同志一齐研究，经常把猪食煮得有些甜味，猪见到这个食，就都点头拍耳的把肚子吃的滚圆滚圆的。
    经过我们全体同志的努力，我们仓库的猪子死亡率和病猪都减少了。在1954年下半年，第一次发现猪子长了肉。这是仓库里从来没有过的事。1955年，我们仓库全年进仓十六万多头猪，长肉七十多万斤，算起来每头猪每天长肉一斤多，为国家增加财富二十六万多元，如果出口，就能换回钢材一万九千多吨，全年只死了二十五头猪。今年，到现在为止，还没有死过一头猪。每头猪每天长肉一斤四两。我看到养猪对国家有这么大的贡献，我再也不想离开生猪仓库了，我要干他一辈子。
    发展祖国的医学遗产
    电针疗法的创造者、陕西省西安第一卫生学校电针疗法教研室教员朱龙玉，在昨天的会上介绍了创造电针疗法的经过。他说：1951年人民日报上连载了几篇“针灸疗法”的文章，这时我正在学习解剖，但它引起了我学习针灸疗法的很大兴趣。为了真正体会针灸的作用，我首先在自己身上做针刺试验。苏联的学者们用过电麻醉和电催眠。于是我想在针上加以电流，希望能发生这种作用，我向领导上反映了这个意图，党和行政立刻支持这个意见，同志们也热情的帮助我做实验。1953年拨了款，并调来十几个工作人员，在西安卫生干部学校成立了电针疗法研究室。在党的支持和群众的协助下，两年来我们创造了低周率、高周率、单极高周率、直流电针机等几种电疗机。朱龙玉说：试验结果证明，电针疗法的作用可以治疗：神经、消化、呼吸、泌尿生殖、肌肉关节风湿、皮肤病及精神病等七类病中的七十多种疾病。就治疗一千八百人的病例来看，有功效的达86％以上，其中治愈率占37％。在经济意义上说，以治疗精神病来看，电针与胰岛素疗法效果几乎相等，而一个病人用胰岛素的药费约在三百元以上，电针所用的电费最多为二元一角。在学术的意义上说，通过临床治疗看出电针不仅能治疗官能性疾病，还可以治疗某些器质性疾患。
    在昨天的会议上，其他代表的发言也都非常生动，精彩。社会主义建设的热情，始终充满在广大的大会场里。
