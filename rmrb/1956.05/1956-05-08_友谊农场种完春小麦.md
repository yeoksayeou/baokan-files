    Friendship Farm Completes Spring Wheat Planting
    By the evening of the 4th, the state-owned Friendship Farm had sown 15,656 hectares of wheat, victoriously completing this year's spring wheat sowing task.
    The wheat sowing work in various branches started one after another from April 6th. When the sowing work was in full swing, the maximum number of tractors mobilized for sowing reached 49 per day. Because there had been several snowfalls before sowing, and two spring rains after the sowing started, the land in the relatively low-lying operating areas was very muddy, which brought great difficulties to the sowing work. However, the workers utilized all available sowing time and created many methods to speed up the sowing process. Almost every vehicle mobilized for sowing created a record exceeding the work quota.
    While sowing wheat, some of the farm's tractors carried out harrowing work before sowing the autumn crops. The farm's 8,000 hectares of soybeans will begin sowing soon. (Xinhua News Agency)

    友谊农场种完春小麦
    到四日晚间，国营友谊农场播种了一万五千六百五十六公顷小麦，胜利地完成了今年播种春小麦的任务。
    各分场小麦播种工作是由四月六日起先后开始的。播种工作全面展开的时候，一天出动播种的拖拉机最多达到四十九台。由于播种前连续下了几场雪，播种开始后又落了两次春雨，在比较低洼的作业地里，土地非常泥泞，给播种工作带来很大的困难。但是职工们利用了一切可以利用的播种时间，创造了许多加快播种速度的方法，几乎每一台出动播种的机车，都创造了超过作业定额的纪录。
    在播种小麦的同时，农场的一部分拖拉机进行了大秋作物播种前的耙地工作。全场八千公顷大豆，最近就要开始播种。  （新华社）
