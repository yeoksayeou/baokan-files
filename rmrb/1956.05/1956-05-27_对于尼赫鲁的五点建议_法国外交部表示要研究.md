Xinhua News Agency, 26th dispatch from Paris: A French Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on the 25th that France considers Indian Prime Minister Nehru's five-point proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue to be "very important." He stated that France will study these suggestions with "great interest."

However, the spokesperson also said that this does not mean that France is prepared to endorse these proposals.

On the same day, French Foreign Minister Pineau, when answering reporters' questions, said that he praised Nehru's "magnanimous spirit and consistent desire to resolve all issues peacefully," but he believed that there was a "great distance" between this desire and the reality of the situation.

    对于尼赫鲁的五点建议
    法国外交部表示要研究
    新华社26日讯　巴黎消息：法国外交部发言人二十五日说，法国认为印度总理尼赫鲁关于和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的五点建议“很重要”。他表示，法国将用“很大的兴趣，”来研究这些建议。
    但是，这个发言人又说，这并不等于说法国准备赞成这些建议。
    同一天，法国外交部长比诺在回答记者的问题的时候说，他赞扬尼赫鲁“豁达的胸襟和一贯希望用和平方式解决一切问题的愿望”，但是他认为，这种愿望和现实情况之间有“很大距离”。
