    Cultivate Diverse Interests of Young Children
    Over One Hundred Children's Extracurricular Education Institutions Nationwide
    To date, there are 137 children's extracurricular education institutions across the country, including Children's Palaces, Children's Homes, children's libraries and reading rooms, clubs and recreation rooms, sports grounds, and cinemas.
    At the Beijing Children's Home, children held a meeting with the mother of Soviet hero Zoya. Various places also held meetings between heroes, model figures, and children.
    Extracurricular education institutions in various places also carry out various meaningful activities to cultivate children's diverse interests and stimulate their creativity and habits of independent thinking. The aviation model group organized by the Shanghai Children's Palace overcame many difficulties to successfully trial-produce an aircraft model and enlarged it from the original drawing to make an aircraft model with a wingspan of three meters.
    The activities of children's extracurricular education institutions have also greatly helped the development of extracurricular recreational activities in schools. The puppet show performances held by the Beijing Children's Home and the Guangzhou Children's Palace quickly aroused children's interest, and now puppet show groups have been established in many schools in Beijing and Guangzhou.
    Many children's libraries and reading rooms also frequently organize children to read books, listen to stories, recite poems, and create wall newspapers, enriching children's knowledge. Many Children's Palaces and Children's Homes also frequently organize camping, bicycle trips, skating, and playing football.

    培养少年儿童多方面的兴趣
    全国已有一百多处儿童校外教育机关
    到目前为止，全国各地已经有137处少年儿童校外教育机关，其中包括少年宫、少年之家、儿童图书馆和阅览室、俱乐部和游艺室、运动场、电影院等。
    在北京少年之家，孩子们举行了和苏联英雄卓娅的母亲的见面会。各地还举办了英雄模范人物和儿童们的见面会。
    各地校外教育机关还开展各种有意义的活动来培养孩子们多方面的兴趣，激发他们的创造性和独立思考的习惯。上海少年宫组织的航空模型小组曾经克服许多困难试制成功了一架飞机模型，并且从原图样上放大做一架机翼全长三公尺的飞机模型。
    儿童校外教育机关的活动还大大帮助了学校课外文娱活动的开展。北京少年之家和广州少年宫举办的木偶戏会演，很快引起了儿童的兴趣，现在北京、广州许多学校中已经建立了木偶戏小组。
    许多儿童图书馆和阅览室也经常组织儿童阅读图书、听故事、朗诵诗歌、出墙报等，丰富了儿童们的知识。不少少年宫、少年之家还经常组织露营、自行车旅行、滑冰、踢足球等。
