    Han River Downstream Diversion Project Completed

    The Han River Downstream Diversion Project was successfully completed on April 20th. Now, this diversion gate, which is over 400 meters long and has 30 openings, stands tall before the people, and two 21-kilometer-long flood discharge channels have also been built, ready to divert floodwaters during the flood season. The completion of this project directly alleviates the threat of floods in the lower reaches of the Han River, ensuring the safety of Wuhan City and sixteen counties. (Wang Dingyu, Xiang Tao)

    汉江下游分洪工程完工
    汉江下游分洪工程已经在四月二十日胜利完工。现在，这座长达四百多公尺，有三十个孔的分洪大闸已经耸立在人们面前，两条长二十一公里的泄洪道也已筑成，在汛期中便可泄洪。这个工程的完工，直接解除了汉江下游洪水的威胁，保障了武汉市和十六个县的安全。（王定郁、向韬）
