    Heine died a hundred years ago
    Hans Cibulka
    In Germany, the poet once had the right to sing of the dead and extol the things of God, but if he tried to rectify the things of life, he would suffer! Barabam! Thus the angry market cried, shouting at his poems, throwing stones. But those who love mankind protect them like a hope, because singers always walk ahead of life, never ceasing, and pluck the blood-red heart of love from the thorns of the times.
    (This is a poem by the German poet Hans Cibulka recited at the commemoration of three world cultural figures held in Beijing.)

    海涅逝世一百周年纪念
    汉斯·齐布尔卡
    诗人在德意志曾经有权利歌唱死者，颁扬神的事物，但是把生存的事物整顿，他就要受罪！巴拉巴姆！于是愤怒的市场叫喊，向着他的诗歌叫喊着，投掷石块。但是爱人类的人们保护它们像是一个希望，因为歌手们永久走在生活前面，永不停息，并且从时代的荆棘丛中，摘取爱的血红的心。
    （这是德国诗人汉斯·齐布尔卡在北京举行的三位世界文化名人纪念会上朗诵的诗。）
