Ensure Full Cotton Stands and Strive to Achieve Increased Production Targets
The Ministry of Agriculture Holds Cotton High-Yield Demonstration Work Report Meeting in Henan

After the basic completion of cotton sowing, the Ministry of Agriculture held a large-scale cotton high-yield demonstration work report meeting at the Anyang Cotton Farm in Henan Province from May 5th to 11th. This meeting focused on how to ensure full cotton stands to achieve increased production targets.

The meeting pointed out that after cotton seedlings emerge, many areas often experience cooling temperatures and overcast and rainy weather, which not only affects the development of cotton seedlings but may also cause the spread of diseases and insect pests. In order to ensure full stands, the meeting considered that the following technical aspects must be grasped: First, early cultivation, especially inter-cultivation close to the cotton plants, is very effective in breaking up soil crusting after rain. For weak cotton seedlings, fast-acting fertilizers should be quickly applied. After emergence, thinning and spacing should be done early; however, in alkaline areas or areas where insect pests are spreading, thinning can be delayed until the cotton plants have three true leaves. Regarding the issue of seedling density, the meeting considered that increasing density on the basis of past sparse planting is an important measure for high yields, but it is necessary to prevent excessive dense planting regardless of conditions. The density standard should be determined based on soil quality, fertility, variety, and technical foundation. It is necessary to implement seedling spacing with a ruler and transplant seedlings in a timely manner to ensure the number of plants.

    保证棉花全苗，争取达到增产目标
    农业部在河南举行棉花丰产示范工作汇报会
    棉花播种基本结束后，农业部于五月五日到十一日在河南省安阳棉场，召开了一次大面积棉花丰产示范工作汇报会议。这次会议着重研究了如何保证棉花全苗达到增产目标的问题。
    会议指出，棉花出苗后，不少地区时常降温和阴雨，因而不仅棉苗发育受到影响，并且可能引起病虫害蔓延。为了保证全苗，会议认为必须抓紧以下技术环节：首先要早中耕，特别是紧靠棉株间中耕，对雨后破除土层板结有很大作用。对瘦弱的棉苗，要迅速追补速效肥料。出苗后，要早疏苗、早间苗；但是碱性地或虫害蔓延地区，可以推迟到棉花长出三个真叶时定苗。关于留苗密度问题，会议认为，在过去稀植的基础上增加密度是丰产的重要措施，但是必须防止不顾条件过度密植，密度标准应该根据土质、地力、品种和技术基础来确定。要实行用尺子定苗，及时移苗，保证株数。
