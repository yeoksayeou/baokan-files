Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 25th. Czechoslovak Republic Premier Široký said in Prague on the 24th that during the second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960), Czechoslovakia will basically establish the material production base of socialism. Czechoslovakia's task in developing its economy is to catch up with and surpass the most advanced capitalist countries, including the United States, in terms of per capita output.

Široký made these remarks at a press conference held for Czechoslovak and foreign journalists. Široký said that the task before us is significant. In the next five years, the increase in Czechoslovakia's total industrial output alone will be 22% more than the total industrial output in 1937. Agricultural production will increase by 30%, and the basis for increased production is to improve the mechanization of agricultural work, increase fertilizer production, mobilize land reserves, and further develop large-scale cooperative agricultural production. The Premier announced that from June 1st of last year to May 1st of this year, more than 1,200 agricultural cooperatives have been added. Široký said that during the second Five-Year Plan, the production of consumer goods will also be greatly increased, which will increase residents' consumption by one-third, while the real wages of workers will increase by 30%.

When talking about the issue of Czechoslovakia catching up with the most advanced capitalist countries in terms of economic level, Premier Široký said that current experience proves that Czechoslovakia can achieve this task. He pointed out that, on a per capita basis, Czechoslovakia's steel production in 1955 has increased from 159 kilograms in 1937 to 342 kilograms, electricity production has increased from 285 kilowatt-hours to 1150 kilowatt-hours, and coke production has increased from nearly 240 kilograms to 530 kilograms. By 1960, on a per capita basis, Czechoslovakia's steel production will increase to 475 kilograms, electricity production will increase to 1,840 kilowatt-hours, and coke production will increase to 630 kilograms. Široký said that in 1955, Czechoslovakia's per capita steel production had already caught up with France and was approaching the level of the United Kingdom and West Germany, and its per capita electricity production will also exceed the current level of the United Kingdom and West Germany by 1960.

Široký then talked about the international significance of the new Five-Year Plan in the peaceful economic competition with capitalist countries, saying that the peaceful development of the Czechoslovak economy enables it to vigorously expand trade relations with various countries on the basis of mutual benefit.

    捷总理西罗基谈新五年计划的国际意义
    争取在经济水平上超过最先进的资本主义国家
    新华社布拉格25日电　捷克斯洛伐克共和国总理西罗基二十四日在布拉格说，在第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）期间，捷克斯洛伐克将基本上建立起社会主义的物质生产基础。捷克斯洛伐克发展经济的任务是要在按人口平均计算的产量方面赶上和超过包括美国在内的最先进的资本主义国家。
    西罗基这番话是在为捷克斯洛伐克和外国记者举行的一次记者招待会上说的。西罗基说，摆在我们面前的任务是重大的。今后五年间，单是捷克斯洛伐克工业总产量的增加额就将比1937年的工业总产量还多22％。农业生产将增加30％，增产的基础是提高农业工作的机械化程度、增加肥料生产、动用土地后备和进一步发展大规模的合作化农业生产。这位总理宣布，从去年六月一日到今年五月一日，农业合作社已经增加了一千二百多个。西罗基说，在第二个五年计划期间，消费品的生产也要大大增加，这将使得居民的消费量增加三分之一，同时职工的实际工资将增加30％。
    在谈到从经济水平上要使捷克斯洛伐克赶上最先进的资本主义国家的问题的时候，西罗基总理说，目前的经验证明，捷克斯洛伐克是可以实现这个任务的。他指出，按人口平均计算，1955年捷克斯洛伐克的钢产量已经从1937年的159公斤增加到342公斤，电力产量已经从285瓩时增加到1150瓩时，焦炭产量已经从将近240公斤增加到530公斤。而到1960年，按人口平均计算，捷克斯洛伐克的钢产量将增加为475公斤，电力产量将增加为1，840瓩时，焦炭产量将增加为630公斤。西罗基说，1955年，捷克斯洛伐克按人口平均计算的钢产量已经赶上法国，并且接近英国和西德的水平，而按人口平均计算的电力产量也将在1960年超过英国和西德目前的水平。
    西罗基接着谈到了新五年计划在同资本主义国家的和平经济竞赛中的国际意义，他说，捷克斯洛伐克经济的和平发展，使得它能够大力扩大同各国以互利为基础的贸易联系。
