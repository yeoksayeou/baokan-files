　　All Generating Units of Guanting Hydropower Station Put into Operation

　　The third and final generating unit of the Guanting Hydropower Station officially began operation on the morning of April 29th. Thus, this first hydropower station built in our country during the First Five-Year Plan has been put into full production.

　　The head of the construction project for this fully automated hydropower station told Xinhua News Agency reporters that the other two generating units, which were put into production earlier, have also undergone thorough maintenance. Starting from midnight on April 30th, all units of the hydropower station have been operating together, transmitting electricity to the Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou power grid. This is of great significance for supporting the industrial construction of the Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou areas, especially the Beijing area. In recent years, the industrial development of the Beijing area has been very rapid. Industrial electricity consumption in 1955 was nearly twice that of 1950, and lighting electricity consumption increased by one and a half times. Now that the Guanting Hydropower Station is fully operational, the problem of electricity shortage can be solved.

　　As early as December 26th of last year, the entire construction project of the Guanting Hydropower Station was completed three months ahead of the original plan, and the first unit began to transmit electricity to the Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou power grid. On April 7th of this year, the second unit was installed and put into production two months ahead of schedule. Now, the people building the hydropower station have installed the last unit in three months, shortening the time by more than a month compared to the installation of the first unit.

　　官厅水电站全部发电设备投入生产
    官厅水力发电站的第三台也是最后一台发电机组，在四月二十九日早上正式开始运转。至此，我国在第一个五年计划中兴建的这个第一座水力发电站，就全部投入生产了。
    建设这座全部自动化的水力发电站的工程处的负责人告诉新华社记者说，先期投入生产的另外两台发电机组，也已经经过周密的检修。从四月三十日夜里零时起，这个水电站的全部机组一起开动起来，把电力输送到京、津、唐、张电力网里去。这对支援北京、天津、唐山、张家口地区，特别是北京地区的工业建设有很大意义。近几年来，北京地区的工业发展很快，1955年的工业用电比1950年增加近两倍，照明用电增加了一倍半。现在，官厅水力发电站全部投入生产，电力不足的问题就可得到解决。
    早在去年十二月二十六日，官厅水力发电站的全部建筑工程就比原来计划提前三个月建成，第一台机组开始向京、津、唐、张电力网送电。今年四月七日，第二台机组又提前两个月安装完毕投入生产。现在，建设水电站的人们又以三个月的时间安装好最后一台机组，比安装第一台机组缩短了一个多月。（新华社）
