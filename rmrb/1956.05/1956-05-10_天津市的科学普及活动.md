This year, the Tianjin Association for the Popularization of Science and Technology will hold nearly 12,000 natural science propaganda lectures in more than 200 units, including trade union clubs, cultural palaces, and agricultural producers' cooperatives, which is almost four times the total number of propaganda lectures in the past two and a half years.

    天津市的科学普及活动
    天津市公安学校七百多名教职员工在八日晚间听了一次丰富有趣的科学幻想讲演——“第一次飞到月球上去”。主讲人天津师范学院物理系教授沈琳庆。
    这次讲演是天津市科学技术普及协会主办的。今年，天津市科学技术普及协会要在工会俱乐部、文化宫、农业生产合作社等二百多个单位举行近一万二千次自然科学的宣传讲演，比过去两年半宣传讲演次数的总和增加近四倍。现在，天津市科学技术普及协会已经和工厂、文化宫等二十九个单位订立了全年或季度讲演计划的合同。  （据新华社讯）
