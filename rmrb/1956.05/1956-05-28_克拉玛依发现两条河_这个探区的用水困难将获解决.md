Two Rivers Discovered in Karamay
Water Shortage in the Exploration Area to be Resolved

    Two rivers have been found near the Karamay Oil Exploration Area. These two rivers will solve the water shortage problem in this exploration area. The Talbut River can produce more than 150,000 cubic meters of water per day, and the Baohutu River can produce more than 40,000 cubic meters of water per day. These two rivers are 25 to 45 kilometers away from the exploration area.

    Since drilling began in the Karamay exploration area last year, no surface water has been found. The few water wells drilled not only have small yields, but also contain bitter water. The large amount of water needed for daily drilling and for the workers has to be transported from more than 100 kilometers away, so drilling work is often interrupted due to the lack of water supply. These two rivers can not only fully supply water for drilling projects, workers' lives, and greening the exploration area, but also provide enough water for large-scale water injection into the oil field in the future.

    克拉玛依发现两条河
    这个探区的用水困难将获解决
    克拉玛依石油探区附近找到了两条河。这两条河将使这个探区的用水困难得到解决。塔尔不特河每天可以产水十五万多立方公尺，包乎图河每天可以产水四万多立方公尺。这两条河距离探区二十五到四十五公里。
    克拉玛依探区从去年开钻以来，一直没有找到地面水，钻凿的几口水井不但水量小，而且都是苦水。探区每天钻井和职工需用的大量的水都要从一百多公里以外去运输，所以常常因水供应不上，使钻井工作停顿。这两条河不仅可以充分供应钻探工程、职工生活和绿化探区的用水，而且还可以供应将来向油田大量注水时足够的用水。（据新华社讯）
