From May 25th to June 25th, nurseries in the rural suburbs of Beijing are universally carrying out hygiene publicity work. Through this extensive publicity, nursery workers and children's mothers will understand general knowledge of children's hygiene, and gradually change the past unhygienic habits.

In order to do this work well, the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation and the Beijing Public Health Bureau have printed a batch of publicity materials on hygiene common sense for rural nurseries, and forty sets (thirty-two sheets each) of colored children's hygiene common sense pictures.

    广泛宣传儿童卫生知识
    从五月二十五日到六月二十五日，北京市郊区农村托儿组织普遍开展卫生宣传工作。通过这次广泛宣传，使保育员和孩子的妈妈懂得一般儿童卫生知识，逐步改变过去不讲卫生的习惯。
    为了做好这一工作，北京市民主妇女联合会和北京市公共卫生局印发了一批农村托儿组织卫生常识的宣传材料，和四十套（每套三十二张）彩色儿童卫生常识图片。
