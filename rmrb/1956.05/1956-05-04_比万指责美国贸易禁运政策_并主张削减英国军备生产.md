Xinhua News Agency, 3rd Dispatch: According to Reuters, British Labour Party left-wing leader Aneurin Bevan has accused the United States' trade embargo policy and stated that Britain can only cope with the large number of orders suggested by the Soviet Union by cutting arms production.

Bevan delivered a speech at a gathering in Scotland on April 29th, accusing the US government's trade embargo policy as "a policy that has made Britain's situation difficult in the past five or six years." He said that trade with the Chinese market should be opened, and he pointed out that because the United States prevented Japan from trading with China, it has intensified the struggle between Japan and Britain for the textile market. Bevan said: "I think it is unreasonable why Lancashire's cotton mills are closing down mainly because the United States is preventing the Japanese from selling their goods to China."

On the same day, Bevan said at another gathering in Scotland: "Britain does not have the capacity to cope with the Russian orders for machinery unless it reduces the amount of steel used by the arms industry."

Bevan said: "If we stop manufacturing so many planes that cannot fly, if we stop producing hundreds of millions of pounds worth of weapons that we can never use, we might be able to supply Russia's orders, but we are not capable of doing both." This is "because we don't have enough steel."

    比万指责美国贸易禁运政策
    并主张削减英国军备生产
    新华社3日讯　据路透社消息：英国工党左翼领袖比万指责美国的贸易禁运政策，并且说，英国只有削减军备生产才能应付苏联方面所建议的大量订货。
    比万四月二十九日在苏格兰的一个集会上发表演说，指责美国政府的贸易禁运政策是“使英国在过去五、六年来处境困难的政策”。他说，应该开放同中国市场的贸易，他指出由于美国阻止日本同中国贸易，使日本和英国之间加剧了争夺纺织品市场的斗争。比万说：“我觉得毫无道理，为什么兰开夏的棉纺工厂主要因为美国阻止日本人出售他们的货品给中国而关厂。”
    同一天，比万在苏格兰的另一个集会上说：“英国没有能力应付俄国订购机械制造品的订货单，除非削减军备工业的用钢量。”
    比万说：“如果我们停止制造这样多的不能飞行的飞机，如果我们停止生产数以亿镑计的我们决不能使用的武器，我们就可能有能力供应俄国的订货，但是我们没有能力两者都干。”这是“因为我们的钢不够”。
