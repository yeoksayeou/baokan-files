Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch from Washington: The latest issue of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine reports that anti-American sentiment is growing in Canada. The magazine says that the emotions caused by American "intrusion" have now become a factor in Canadian politics. In the election campaign, Canadian Progressive Conservative Party leader George Drew has put forward an anti-American campaign slogan. He called on Canadians to "declare economic independence from the United States" and oppose Canada being "treated as the 50th state of the United States." Complaints of dissatisfaction with the United States can also be heard in other occasions. Words such as "economic slavery," "economic colonialism," and "foreign shackles" are everywhere in Canada, especially in the Progressive Conservative newspapers.

A prominent Canadian columnist wrote: "In Canada, there is such fear of excessive American control over our commercial life (not to mention control over our defense) that even a spark could ignite anger."

The American big business magazine said that about a quarter of all investment in Canadian industry (including mining, manufacturing, railways, utilities, and raw materials industries) is owned by American companies and individuals. Americans also hold Canadian government, provincial, and municipal bonds.

The magazine also pointed out that Canadians are currently increasing pressure to buy shares in American companies that control the Canadian economy in order to have a greater say in these companies. On a new major project, the Liberal government has taken steps to try to give Canadians the opportunity to obtain controlling shares.

　　加拿大人不愿自己的国家被当作美国第五十个州
    新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：最新一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志报道，加拿大人的反美情绪正在日益高涨。这家杂志说，由于美国的“侵入”而引起的情绪目前已经成为加拿大政治中的一个因素。在竞选运动里，加拿大进步保守党领袖乔治·德鲁已经提出了反美的竞选口号。他号召加拿大人“宣布摆脱美国而实行经济独立”，反对加拿大“被人当作美国的第五十个州来看待”。在其他场合也可以听到对美国不满的怨言。反对“经济奴役”“经济殖民主义”和“外国束缚”之类的字眼在加拿大到处都是，特别是在进步保守党的报纸上。
    一位著名的加拿大专栏作家写道：“在加拿大，对美国过分控制我们的商业生活（更不用说对我们的防御的控制）存在着这样的恐惧，以至即使是星星之火，也可能使愤怒的情绪燃烧起来。”
    这家美国大企业的杂志说，加拿大工业（包括采矿、制造、铁路、公用事业和原料品工业）中的全部投资的约有四分之一是属美国的公司和个人所有的。美国人还握有加拿大政府、省和城市的公债券。
    这家杂志还指出，加拿大人目前也正在增加压力，要求购买控制加拿大经济的美国公司的股份，以便在这些公司中享有更大的发言权。在一个新的大工程上，自由党政府已经采取步骤，设法使加拿大人获得控制性的股份的机会。
