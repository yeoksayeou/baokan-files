Learning from the Spirit and Methods of Veteran Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners in Training Apprentices
Qin Bonan, Consultant of the Ministry of Health for Traditional Chinese Medicine

Training apprentices is one of the traditional Chinese educational methods. In the past, the cultivation of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, apart from a portion being passed down through families, mainly relied on famous doctors imparting knowledge to each other. Through the close relationship between master and apprentice, the master imparted knowledge and experience to the apprentice, who then passed it on to others, creating more and more outstanding talents.

Generally, people are familiar with the fact that Bian Que's teacher was Chang Sangjun, and Zhang Zhongjing's teacher was Zhang Bozu. Later, Bian Que had seven apprentices: Ziyang, Zibao, Zirong, Ziming, Ziyou, Ziyue, and Yang Yi. Zhang Zhongjing also led two apprentices, Du Du and Wei Fan. In particular, Bian Que, after receiving guidance from Chang Sangjun, greatly developed the method of pulse diagnosis. In the Eastern Jin Dynasty, Wang Shuhe wrote "The Pulse Classic," which spread to Korea, Japan, Arabia, and India, making significant contributions to world medicine. Zhang Zhongjing, already knowledgeable in medicine, strengthened his understanding of clinical practice through Zhang Bozu's education, and diligently studied medical records and prescriptions, writing "Treatise on Cold Damage" and "Synopsis of Prescriptions of the Golden Chamber," which have been passed down to the present day and are essential classics for medical practitioners. This illustrates that training apprentices in traditional Chinese medicine not only involves passing on personal academic knowledge to the next generation but also includes the significance of improvement and development.

Family inheritance includes fathers and sons, uncles and nephews, brothers, etc., where elders take on the responsibility of teaching, which is not much different from the nature of training apprentices. Due to the accumulation of experience passed down through generations, knowledge is more specialized, and many outstanding talents have been created. Li Nian'e, the author of "Key Knowledge of the Inner Classic," learned from his uncle and then passed it on to his nephew. The He family in Qingpu, Jiangsu, has been practicing medicine since the Southern Song Dynasty, continuing uninterrupted for more than twenty generations, with He Shutian and He Hongfang being renowned doctors of their respective eras. As for the great scientist Li Shizhen, based on inheriting the medicine of his grandfather and father, he developed his wisdom and the strength of his entire family to engage in drug research, writing "Compendium of Materia Medica," which has aroused the attention of scientists worldwide. Although family inheritance is narrower in scope, it is an important aspect of cultivating traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and should be given attention in various regions.

Students hope to find satisfactory teachers, and teachers also want to find suitable students. Therefore, the combination of master and apprentice must be based on the principle of voluntariness in order to establish a good relationship. During the Jin-Yuan period, Li Dongyuan admired Zhang Yuansu's medicine and was willing to offer a thousand gold as a gift. Zhang Yuansu accepted his sincerity and sincerely taught him everything. Zhu Danxi, in order to find a teacher, crossed the Qiantang River, went to Suzhou, Zhenjiang, and Nanchang, and finally returned to Hangzhou before meeting Luo Zhiti. Luo Zhiti was originally a person who disliked trouble, but he was very happy to see Zhu Danxi and taught him all his skills. The Historical Records also contains a story: Gongcheng Yangqing's medical skills were very high, and he was already over seventy years old with no son to inherit his medicine. Later, he met Chun Yuyi and saw that he was very interested in medicine, so he unconditionally taught him many proven prescriptions. It can be seen here that the relationship between masters and apprentices in the past was very loving. In particular, Gongcheng Yangqing recognized that medicine is a science for treating diseases and saving people, and should be passed on to future generations to serve the broad masses of people, not taken to the grave with him. This spirit is worth learning from by modern traditional Chinese medicine practitioners.

Training good apprentices is a very important link in carrying forward the past and opening up the future. The teacher's good teaching methods and the student's humble learning attitude are also indispensable conditions for learning traditional Chinese medicine well. On the teacher's side, Luo Zhiti taught Zhu Danxi using the medical books of Liu Hejian, Zhang Zihe, and Li Dongyuan, asking him to study the theory first. Luo Zhiti also elaborated on and synthesized the theories of the three, enabling Zhu Danxi to digest and absorb them. Bian Que's method of training apprentices was to take them to consultations together. For example, when treating the Crown Prince of Guo, Bian Que explained the condition and then asked Ziyang to perform acupuncture, and Zibao to perform moxibustion and decoction. From these examples, it can be seen that the ancients emphasized the combination of theory and practice in teaching apprentices, and were very serious in guiding students. On the student's side, Hua Bolin wrote "Explanation of the Fourteen Meridians," which is still regarded as a famous work in acupuncture. Hua Bolin initially studied internal medicine with Wang Juzhong, and in order to improve his skills, he also learned acupuncture from Gao Dongyang. In the Qing Dynasty, Ye Tianshi studied medicine with his father, Ye Yangsheng, from a young age. When his father passed away at the age of fourteen, he felt his knowledge was shallow, so he continued to study with his elder brother, Zhu. Later, when he heard which doctor was good at treating which disease, he would go to ask for advice. He consulted seventeen teachers in total, learning the strengths of all of them. This also shows that in order to learn well, students need to work hard; in addition to the teacher's teaching, it also relies on conscious self-improvement and humble acceptance of guidance.

In traditional Chinese medicine apprenticeship, questions are often raised between master and apprentice, and answered mutually, which was previously called "asking difficulties," equivalent to the current discussion. Through this discussion, the effect of "teaching and learning from each other" is achieved. For example, Pang Anchang's father in the Song Dynasty was a family doctor and taught Pang Anchang pulse diagnosis. Pang Anchang thought it was not enough and secretly studied the pulse books of Bian Que and others. When his father examined his knowledge, they debated with each other. In short, although the traditional Chinese medicine apprenticeship in the past did not point out specific teaching methods, it can be seen from the above facts that they completed their learning process from theoretical study to clinical practice, and through discussion.

For two thousand years, the development of Chinese medicine has been inseparable from the work of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners training apprentices throughout history. Therefore, the Party and the government's encouragement of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to train apprentices is a very correct measure. Some people think that since colleges and schools of traditional Chinese medicine are to be established, and training courses for traditional Chinese medicine are being organized, and Western doctors are being organized to comprehensively learn traditional Chinese medicine, why should the old-fashioned method of training apprentices still be adopted? This view is not comprehensive enough. With the development of socialist construction, the people's demands for health care are getting higher and higher. Judging from the current number of medical workers, it cannot keep up with the objective needs in any way. If we rely solely on the training of medical colleges, the number is small and time does not allow. Most traditional Chinese medicine practitioners are scattered in the vast rural areas and have always been trusted by the broad masses of farmers. Taking the existing 500,000 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners as an example, if one traditional Chinese medicine practitioner can train one apprentice, the number of new forces can be doubled within a few years. Therefore, the method of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners training apprentices is not in conflict with the establishment of schools. In addition, the rich heritage contained in Chinese medical literature, as long as efforts are made to organize it, can be discovered; however, what is recorded in the literature is only a part of the knowledge passed down by the predecessors, and there are still many living experiences contained in the minds of contemporary traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. It is impossible for traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to concentrate on teaching work, especially those who are older. If we do not learn from them and accept their knowledge, these rich living experiences will be lost at a certain time. Therefore, it was necessary to train apprentices in the past, and it is necessary to train apprentices now.

The conditions for training apprentices now are better than in the past: 1. The ideological awareness of the teachers has been improved, and they recognize that educating the next generation is their glorious task; 2. Under the call of marching towards science and carrying forward the heritage of traditional Chinese medicine, some people are willing and determined to learn traditional Chinese medicine; 3. Current teaching methods have been greatly improved compared with the past; 4. There are far more teaching and reference books than before; 5. There is the assistance of joint clinics and traditional Chinese medicine organizations. In addition, it should be particularly pointed out that with the practical leadership of the Party and the health administrative departments at all levels, any difficulties can be overcome. Now, the traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in Taigu County, Shanxi, have come up with various methods to train apprentices, and they are progressing very smoothly. It is not difficult to imagine that knowledgeable and experienced traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in other places may also be starting to train apprentices or preparing to train apprentices.

Training apprentices in traditional Chinese medicine is a good and fast way to train a large number of traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. Fellow traditional Chinese medicine practitioners should know that training apprentices is not an isolated task, but a part of the entire traditional Chinese medicine work. It is hoped that traditional Chinese medicine practitioners will embrace the spirit of "teaching tirelessly" and the expectation of "the student surpassing the teacher," exert all their strength, and strive to accelerate the growth of new forces in traditional Chinese medicine.

    学习历代中医带徒弟的精神和方法
    卫生部中医顾问　秦伯未
    带徒弟是中国传统的教育方法之一。过去中医的培养，除了一部分家传的以外，主要是靠名医互相传授。通过师徒的亲切关系，老师把学问和经验传授给徒弟，再由徒弟辗转传授给别人，造就了更多更高明的人才。
    一般人都熟悉，扁鹊的老师是长桑君，张仲景的老师是张伯祖。后来，扁鹊的徒弟有子阳、子豹、子容、子明、子游、子越、阳仪等七人；张仲景也带领了杜度和卫汎两个徒弟。特别是扁鹊，在接受了长桑君的指导以后，对于切脉法有很大发展。到了东晋，王叔和写成了“脉经”，流传到朝鲜、日本、阿拉伯和印度，对世界医学有过巨大的贡献。张仲景是一个已经懂得医学的人，经过张伯祖的教育，加强了临床实践的认识，又苦心钻研了病案和药方，写成“伤寒论”和“杂病论”，一直流传到现在，成为医家必读的经典著作。这说明，中医培养徒弟不光是把个人的学术传授给下一代，还包含提高和发扬的意义。
    家传包括父子、叔侄、兄弟等，由长辈负起教导责任，这和带徒弟的性质没有多大分别。由于一脉相承的经验积累，知识比较专门，也造就了很多特出的人才。“内经知要”的作者李念莪，是跟他叔叔学习的，而后又传给他的侄子。江苏青浦何氏从南宋开始行医，传到现在二十多代没有间断过，其中何书田、何鸿舫等都是一代名医。至于伟大科学家李时珍，在继承了祖父和父亲的医学的基础上，发挥了他的智慧和全家的力量，从事药物研究，写成“本草纲目”，引起全世界科学家的珍视。虽然家传的面比较狭窄，但是家传也是培养中医的一个重要方面，应引起各地的注意。
    学生希望得到满意的老师，老师也想得到合式的学生，所以，师徒的结合必须在自愿的原则上，才能建立起很好的关系。金元时代李东垣羡慕张元素的医学，情愿以千金作为贽敬，张元素接受他的诚意，也诚恳地把他教会了；朱丹溪为了寻师，曾经渡过钱塘江，到苏州，到镇江，再到南昌，最后又回到杭州，方才认识罗知悌。罗知悌本来是个怕麻烦的人，见到朱丹溪却很高兴，并且把本领都教给了他。史记上也有一段故事：公乘阳庆的医术非常高明，年纪已有七十多岁，没有儿子可以继承他的医学。后来遇到淳于意，看他对于医学很有兴趣，就无条件地把许多验方教给了他。这里可以看到，前人师徒之间是非常敬爱的，特别是公乘阳庆认识了医学是治病救人的学问，应该传给后人，为广大人民服务，不肯把它带到泥土中去，这种精神是值得现代中医医师学习的。
    带好徒弟是承前启后非常重要的一环。老师良好的教学方法和学生谦虚的学习态度，也是学好祖国医学不可缺少的条件。在老师方面，罗知悌教朱丹溪是用刘河间、张子和、李东垣的医书，叫他先从理论上钻研。罗知悌还把三个人的学说加以发挥和综合，使朱丹溪都能消化吸收。扁鹊带徒弟的方法是领他们一同会诊，如医疗虢太子的时候，扁鹊说明病情以后，就叫子阳扎针，子豹做熨法和调剂。从这些例子来看，前人教徒弟是注重理论与实践相结合，并且是非常认真指导学生的。在学生方面，滑伯仁曾经写成“十四经发挥”一书，至今推为针灸科的名著。滑伯仁起初跟王居中学内科，为了提高技术，又向高洞阳学习针法。清代叶天士自小跟他父亲叶阳生学医，十四岁的时候父亲逝世，感到知识浅薄，就向他的师兄朱某继续学习。后来，他听到那一位医生善治那一种疾病，他就前去请教，前后请教了十七位老师，把他们的长处都学来了。这又说明了学生要学好，需要用功；除了老师教授以外，还有赖自觉的进修和虚心领教。
    中医带徒弟，经常由师徒间提出问题，互相解答，在先前称做问难，相等于现在的讨论。通过这种讨论，收到“教学相长”的效果。举个例子来说，宋代庞安常的父亲是世医，曾把脉书教庞安常，庞安常认为不够，私下里再学扁鹊等人的脉书，他父亲考查他的学问的时候，同他互相辩论。总之，过去中医带徒弟，虽然没有指出具体的教学方法，然而从上述事实，可以看出他们是从理论学习到临床实习，并且通过讨论的方式，完成其学习过程的。
    二千年来，我国医学的发展，是和历代中医带徒弟的工作分不开的。因此，党和政府鼓励中医带徒弟，是十分正确的措施。有人认为既然要开办中医学院和中医学校，并且正在组织中医进修班和组织西医全面学习中医，何必还要采用旧式的带徒弟的方式呢。这种看法是不够全面的。随着社会主义建设事业的发展，人民对于卫生保健的要求越来越高。就目前医务工作者的数量来看，无论如何赶不上客观的需要。如果光靠医学院校培养，数量既少，时间也不允许。中医多数散布在辽阔的农村，一向得到广大农民的信任，以现有五十万中医计算，假设一位中医师能带一个徒弟，几年内就可增加一倍生力军。因此，中医带徒弟的方法同开办学校是没有冲突的。另外，蕴藏在我国医学文献里的丰富遗产，只要下一番整理功夫，是可以发掘出来的；但是文献里面记载的不过是前人知识流传下来的一部分，还有许多活的经验蕴藏在现在中医的头脑里。中医们不可能集中起来都做教学工作，特别是年龄比较高的，如果不去向他们学习，把他们的知识接受下来，这些丰富的活的经验到某一个时期就会失传。因此，过去需要带徒弟，目前也需要带徒弟。
    现在带徒弟比过去带徒弟的条件要好：一、老师们的思想觉悟都有提高，认识教育下一代是他们的光荣任务；二、在向科学进军和发扬祖国医学遗产的号召下，有些人愿意并且有决心学习祖国医学；三、现在的教学法比以前有了很大的改进；四、教学和参考书籍比以前要多得多；五、有联合诊所和中医团体的协助。此外，特别要指出的是，有党和各级卫生行政部门的切实领导，任何困难都可以克服。现在，山西太谷县城的中医，已经想出多种方法来带徒弟，而且进行得非常顺利。不难想到，其它地方的有学问、有经验的中医师，或许也在开始带徒弟或准备带徒弟了。
    中医带徒弟是大量培养中医的又好又快的办法。中医同道们应当知道带徒弟不是一件孤立的工作，而是整个中医工作的一部分。希望中医师们抱着“诲人不倦”的精神，“青出于蓝而胜于蓝”的期望，发挥一切力量，为加速中医新生力量的增长而努力。
