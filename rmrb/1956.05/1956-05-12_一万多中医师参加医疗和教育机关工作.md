    Over 10,000 Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctors Participate in Medical and Educational Institutions

    Currently, over 10,000 Traditional Chinese Medicine doctors across the country are working in various public medical, educational institutions, and government health departments, engaged in medical treatment, medical education, and health administration.

    Most experienced veteran Traditional Chinese Medicine doctors in various regions have been hired by government health departments for responsible positions. Renowned Traditional Chinese Medicine doctors Zhang Cigong and Qin Bowen from Shanghai have come to Beijing to serve as consultants to the Ministry of Health. Renowned Traditional Chinese Medicine doctors Shi Jinmo and Yuan Hecai from Beijing are now consultants to Beijing Hospital; eighty-six-year-old Traditional Chinese Medicine doctor Xiao Longyou has also ended his private practice, with the government covering all his living expenses, allowing him to specialize in Traditional Chinese Medicine academic research in a quiet environment. Others such as Lu Guanhu and Zhao Qifan in Tianjin, Lu Jihan and Jiang Yubo in Wuhan, Wu Zhuoxian, Zhang Xijun and Hu Guangci in Chongqing, Jing Xinong and Wang Xinwu in Xi'an have respectively taken on positions such as president of local Traditional Chinese Medicine hospitals, principal of Traditional Chinese Medicine advanced training schools, and directors of Traditional Chinese Medicine outpatient departments and Traditional Chinese Medicine departments in major hospitals.

    The vast majority of these over 10,000 Traditional Chinese Medicine doctors were gradually absorbed into government health departments and public medical institutions after the Ministry of Health began to correct the erroneous view of discriminating against Traditional Chinese Medicine in 1954.

    一万多中医师参加医疗和教育机关工作
    现在全国已有一万多个中医师在各类公立医疗、教育机关和政府卫生部门中担任着医疗、医学教育和卫生行政工作。
    各地有学术经验的老中医大多被政府卫生部门聘请到负责的工作岗位上。上海市的著名中医章次公和秦伯未已来北京担任卫生部的中医顾问。北京市的著名中医施今墨和袁鹤侪现在都是北京医院的顾问；八十六岁的老中医萧龙友也结束了他的私人诊务，政府负担了他的全部生活费用，让他在安静的条件下专门从事中医学术的研究工作。其他如天津市的陆观虎、赵奇凡，武汉市的陆继韩、蒋玉伯，重庆市的吴棹仙、张锡君、胡光慈，西安市的景莘农、王新午等都分别担任了当地中医院院长、中医进修学校校长、中医门诊部和大医院的中医科主任等职务。
    这一万多个中医师中，极大部分是1954年卫生部开始纠正歧视中医的错误观点以后陆续被吸收到政府卫生部门和公立医疗机构来的。
