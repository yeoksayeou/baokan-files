    Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant
    Conscientiously Promotes Advanced Soviet Experiences
    (Our dispatch) The Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant has formulated measures to comprehensively promote advanced Soviet experiences.
    The plant strengthened the organization responsible for promoting advanced experiences, and at the same time opened advanced producer schools and organized demonstrations by employees who had already mastered advanced Soviet experiences.
    Currently, a wave of enthusiasm for learning from advanced Soviet experiences has been widely launched throughout the plant. The advanced gear hobbing experience of the Soviet advanced producer Lyankov has been promoted on all gear hobbing machines in the First Machining Workshop, with a minimum increase in efficiency of 20% and a maximum increase of four times. After Jia Chunlu and other drillers in the Second Machining Workshop learned from the advanced Soviet driller Korchinko's rapid drilling experience and drilling machine tapping experience, they increased drilling efficiency by more than one time. Using a drilling machine for tapping also increased efficiency by more than twenty-two times compared to manual tapping.

    太原矿山机器厂
    认真推广苏联先进经验
    本报讯　太原矿山机器厂制定了全面推广苏联先进经验的措施。
    这个厂加强了负责推广先进经验工作的机构，同时开办了先进生产者学校，组织已经掌握苏联先进经验的职工进行了表演。
    目前，全厂已经广泛地掀起了学习苏联先进经验的热潮。第一加工车间所有的滚齿机上都推广了苏联先进生产者连柯夫的滚齿经验，最低提高效率20％，最高的提高四倍。第二加工车间贾春禄等钻工学习苏联先进钻工科尔钦柯的快速钻孔经验和钻床绞丝扣经验以后，提高钻孔效率一倍多，用钻床绞扣也比手工绞扣提高效率二十二倍多。
