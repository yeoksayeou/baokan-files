　　One evening during the Spring Festival, the staff of the Red Prairie Ranch put on their new clothes to attend the party, but Sun Xizhi sat on a large rock by the roadside, staring blankly at the sinking sunset.

　　"What kind of work is this, revolving around cow butts all day long!"

　　Sun Xizhi had just arrived in Heilongjiang from Shandong. His brother was a boiler worker at the Red Prairie Ranch, and a letter had called his younger brother over. But the letter didn't specify the job. Only after arriving was he told:

　　"Don't look down on herding cows. Our milk, made into milk powder, can go anywhere—Harbin, Tianjin, Shanghai."

　　"Herding cows? What kind of revolutionary work is that! We have cows and donkeys at home too," the younger brother said dissatisfied.

　　Today was the Spring Festival, and everyone was happily playing, but Sun Xizhi sat on a rock, calculating his work, and then thought of his family...

　　"Sun Xizhi, why aren't you going to the party? It's quite cold outside." Sun Xizhi was lost in thought and didn't hear the footsteps. He was startled by someone speaking. He quickly turned around and saw that it was Director Zhang from the ranch.

　　"I—I'm not cold..."

　　"I know, you have some opinions about your work, right?" Director Zhang said gently.

　　"..." Sun Xizhi began to sob.

　　"We produce a lot of cream and milk powder to supply the people's needs and improve their health. That's like laying bricks and adding tiles to socialist construction. Clearly, you're participating in socialist construction. Who says this isn't revolutionary work!"

　　These words, though few, immediately entered Sun Xizhi's mind. Before this, the socialist construction he had imagined was something intangible; he didn't know how to participate. Now, he understood that he was also part of building socialism.

　　From then on, he settled down. This happened in 1953. He was only eighteen years old then.

　　Cow "3147" had a very irritable temperament. It was previously fed by Zhang Xueyou. Whenever it was milked, it often kicked people with its hind legs. Once, when Zhang Xueyou was sitting on a small stool milking it, it kicked him in the neck; Zhang Xueyou was very angry and picked up the small stool and hit it on the cow's butt. This made the cow furious, and no one could milk it. The first time Sun Xizhi milked cow "3147," he was kicked over. But Sun Xizhi didn't hit it with the small stool. Instead, he saw a pattern; he noticed that the cow's teats seemed to hurt when it was milked. He stood up, stroked it along its fur, and murmured to the cow:

　　"Why do you always kick people? I'm not going to hit you. Does your teat hurt? Huh? Let's milk slowly and see if it hurts, slowly..."

　　He murmured, his hand never leaving the cow's back, slowly stroking its belly and teats. Sure enough, the cow didn't kick him again. He began to milk gently, and the cow didn't move. He then tried to apply a little more force, and the cow started to become uneasy again, wanting to kick. Sun Xizhi quickly stopped milking, stroked it again, and milked it gently. This way, the cow never kicked him. Later, he consulted with the technicians and learned that this cow had just calved and hadn't been milked for three or four months. The teats would naturally hurt when milked for the first time. Now, this cow had been living under his care for three years. He carefully tended to its diet and rest. When it was time to milk, as long as Sun Xizhi shook his iron bucket, cow "3147" would immediately run up to him. He could milk more than twenty kilograms of milk from it every day.

　　Sun Xizhi took care of twelve cows. He knew the temperament of each cow as well as he knew his own fingers.

　　In the summer of 1954, a cow named "Gray Baldy" got sick.

　　This was a small gray-and-white spotted dairy cow, less than two years old when Sun Xizhi got it. Sun Xizhi liked it very much. Because it had no horns, Sun Xizhi gave it a nickname, "Gray Baldy." In the pasture, as long as Sun Xizhi affectionately called out, "Gray Baldy!" it would immediately run to his side.

　　When "Gray Baldy" was three years old, it had already started producing milk; but in this hot summer, it collapsed in the open field. Sun Xizhi immediately found the veterinarian and had him give it an injection. He also cut some tender grass for it to eat, brought cool water for it to drink, and washed it. To keep the sun from shining on it, he also used his rest time to find some poles and straw mats to build a shed for "Gray Baldy."

　　The next day, a southeast wind brought in dark clouds, and a storm struck. When Sun Xizhi rushed to see it, the wind had blown the shed away, and the raindrops were making "Gray Baldy" moo. Sun Xizhi quickly took off his raincoat and covered "Gray Baldy" with it. Seeing that it wasn't fully covered, he took off his shirt and found a straw mat to cover it. Then he brought some dry grass and placed it under its body.

　　On the third day, "Gray Baldy" got up, looked at Sun Xizhi with its big eyes, and licked his hand...

　　The hottest days of summer are the season when various flowers and plants on the prairie are most lush. Alkali grass is seeding, neatly arranged like a giant shag carpet laid on the ground, with a layer of flowers of various colors floating on top.

　　The large herd of cows quietly ate grass, and Sun Xizhi sat on the grass, flipping through his diary. These were the feeding techniques the technician had taught in class:

　　If we take one kilogram of oats as a feed unit, then one kilogram of the best alkali grass is equal to 0.48 feed units. A 500-kilogram dairy cow consumes 0.42 feed units for every kilogram of milk produced.

　　Sun Xizhi closed his diary, looked at the endless prairie, and murmured:

　　"What good grass this is, one kilogram of grass can be exchanged for one kilogram of milk!" He had deeply fallen in love with this beautiful prairie and all the work he did on it.

　　"Eat, take advantage of this great season!" He walked up to the cows and watched them eat grass.

　　At this moment, he found that the cows in front were trampling the grass, and the cows behind didn't want to eat it. Good grass was being trampled, and the cows were eating slowly. How could he prevent the grass from being trampled? He thought: He couldn't let a group of cows roam randomly. They should be lined up and move forward side by side. Because cows have a habit of walking straight forward step by step when they eat grass, without turning. However, the cows didn't understand his intention and didn't want to eat in line. Sun Xizhi slowly guided and trained them. Over time, the cows were able to line up in a long row and advance simultaneously. Sun Xizhi called this the "single-whip grazing method."

　　Sun Xizhi put all his energy into the cows. He always carefully watched how the cows ate grass and how they moved. Initially, he found that the cows always walked with their backs to the sun. He tentatively led a cow over, letting it face the sun. This didn't work because it couldn't open its eyes and couldn't see the grass. With its back to the sun, its eyes were wide open. He also discovered a rule: cows always walked into the wind. He wondered, what was the reason? Sun Xizhi tried turning the cow around, letting it walk with the wind, but he immediately saw that its eyes were covered with horseflies and mosquitoes, biting it restlessly. When it turned around and walked into the wind, the horseflies and mosquitoes were blown away by the wind. He also noticed that when it rained, there was no sun and no horseflies or mosquitoes, but if it still walked into the wind, the raindrops would make it unable to open its eyes. Therefore, when it rained, the cows always walked with the wind. Every day, Sun Xizhi followed these three rules, deciding which pasture to choose and in which direction to move, based on the weather.

　　The technicians at the ranch studied his grazing methods and thought they were reasonable, so they summarized them into two sentences: "Face the wind, back to the sun, let them graze with the wind on rainy days."

　　In the evening, Sun Xizhi found that the cows couldn't stand or lie down properly. He immediately realized that it was the mosquitoes again. "People in the dormitory burn grass braids to smoke out the mosquitoes. Can't we smoke out the mosquitoes for the cows?" Thinking of this, he immediately brought some dry grass, covered it with wet grass, and lit it upwind. The smoke blew into the herd, and it drove the mosquitoes away. Sun Xizhi was very happy.

　　One evening, Sun Xizhi found that the cows were not very quiet again, thinking that the mosquitoes were biting them again. When he came out to look, the smoke was very heavy, and one cow was foaming at the mouth. Was it sick? He was so anxious that he was sweating. He led it around. After walking out of the smoky area, the cow was fine. It turned out that the smoke was too heavy, and it could also hurt the cows.

　　Past midnight, Sun Xizhi came out to see his cows again. The wind was cool, and the grass leaves were covered with dew, and there were no mosquitoes - wasn't this a good time to graze the cows? After getting the captain's approval, he changed the grazing time to early departure, late return, and rest in the middle of the day.

　　Due to his careful care, the dairy cows fed by Sun Xizhi produced 40% more than the average yield of the ranch. Therefore, in 1955, he participated in the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference. This year, the cow with the highest yield produced 6,463 kilograms of milk. This year, he plans to have this cow produce 7,500 kilograms of milk. The average milk production of all the cows he grazes will also increase from 3,792 kilograms last year to 5,000 kilograms this year. Of course, this requires more labor and wisdom to achieve.

    孙锡智和他的乳牛

    一
    春节的傍晚，红色草原牧场的职工们都穿上新衣服去参加晚会，只有孙锡智坐在道边的一块大石头上，望着逐渐沉没的晚霞出神。
    “这叫什么工作，天天围着牛屁股转！”
    孙锡智是刚刚从山东来到黑龙江的。他的哥哥在红色草原牧场当锅炉工，一封信就把弟弟叫来了。但是信上并没有说明什么工作，来到以后才跟他讲的：
    “别看不起放牛，咱们的牛奶，作成奶粉，哈尔滨、天津、上海，哪里都能去。”
    “放牛？这算什么革命工作！咱家里 也有牛，也有驴。”弟弟不满地说。
    今天过春节，大家都欢天喜地玩着，孙锡智却坐在一块石头上盘算着自己的工作，后来又想到了家里的人们……
    “孙锡智，你怎么不去参加晚会，外边挺冷的。”孙锡智正在出神，没听见脚步声，冷不防听见有人说话，赶紧回头一看，原来是场里的张主任。
    “不——冷……”
    “我知道，你是对工作有意见，是吗？”张主任温和地说。
    “……”孙锡智竟抽泣起来了。
    “咱们生产很多很多的奶油、奶粉，供给人民需要，增进人民的健康，就是给社会主义建设砌砖、添瓦。明明是参加了社会主义的建设，谁说这不叫革命工作！”
    话虽不多，可是一下子就钻到“孙锡智的脑子里。在这以前，他所想像的社会主义建设，是一个摸不着边际的东西，不晓得怎样才算参加社会主义建设；现在，他明白了，自己也是建设社会主义的一分子。
    从此以后，他安下心来。这是1953年的事。他那时才十八岁。
    二
    “3147”号牛脾气很躁，以前归张学有喂养，每逢挤奶，它常常抬起后腿来踢人。有一回张学有正坐着小板凳挤奶，它一蹄子踢到他脖子上；张学有很生气，拿起小板凳来，照着牛屁股上打了一下。这一下子可把牛惹急了，谁来挤奶也不行。孙锡智头一次给“3147”号牛挤奶的时候就被它踢了个跟头。但是孙锡智并没有拿小板凳打它，他反倒看出门道来了；他看到挤奶的时候，好像牛的乳头疼。他就站起来，顺着毛抚摩它，嘴里也在叨叨咕咕地跟牛说话：
    “你怎么老踢人呢？我又不打你。奶头疼吗？呵？慢慢挤奶看看疼不疼，慢慢地……”
    他叨咕着，手一直没有离开牛背，慢慢地，又抚摩着它的肚子和奶头，果然牛再没有踢他。他开始轻轻地挤奶，牛还没有动。他又抱着试验的态度，稍为用力挤一下，牛又开始不安起来，又想抬腿踢人。孙锡智就赶快停止挤奶，又抚摩它，又轻轻地挤，这样牛一次也没有踢过他。后来他跟技术人员研究，才知道这个牛是刚刚下完犊，有三、四个月没有挤过奶，乍一挤，奶头自然就疼了。现在，这头牛已经在他的照护下生活了三年。他细心地关照着它的饮食和休息，到挤奶的时候，孙锡智只要一摇晃他的铁桶，“3147”号牛马上就跑到他跟前来。他每天都要从它身上挤出二十多公斤牛奶。
    孙锡智照管着十二头牛。他就像熟悉他自己的手指一样，把每一头牛的性情都摸得一清二楚。
    1954年夏天，有一头名叫“灰秃子”的牛病了。
    这是个灰白花的小乳牛，到孙锡智手里的时候，还不满两周岁，孙锡智非常喜欢它。因为它没有犄角，孙锡智就给它起了个小名，叫“灰秃子”。在草地里，孙锡智只要亲昵地喊一声：“灰秃子！”它马上就会跑到他身边来。
    “灰秃子”三周岁的时候，已经开始产奶；可是就在这个炎热的夏天，它在露天地里病倒了。孙锡智马上把兽医找来，给它注射了药针。又割来一些柔嫩的小草，给它吃。提来清凉的水给它喝，给它洗。为了不让太阳晒它，他还利用休息时间，找来一些杆子、草帘子、给“灰秃子”搭了个凉棚。
    第二天，一阵东南风，卷来满天乌云，狂风暴雨同时袭来。孙锡智赶来看它的时候，狂风把凉棚刮跑了，大雨点子淋的“灰秃子”“哞哞”直叫，孙锡智赶快把自己的雨衣脱下来，给“灰秃子”盖上，一看没有盖严，就光着膀子找来个草帘子盖到它身上。接着又抱了些干草来，垫在它身子下面。
    第三天，“灰秃子”起来了，它瞪着两只大眼看着孙锡智，舔着他的手……
    三
    三伏天，是草原上各种花草最繁茂的季节。碱草正在孕穗，整整齐齐的，像铺在大地上的一幅巨型的栽绒毯，在它的上面，还漂浮着一层各种不同颜色的花朵。
    大群的牛静静地吃着草，孙锡智坐在草地上翻着他的日记本。这是技术员上课讲的饲养技术：
    如果把一公斤燕麦作为一个饲料单位的话，那么一公斤最好的碱草等于零点四八个饲料单位。一头五百公斤重的乳牛，每产一公斤奶，要消耗零点四二个饲料单位。
    孙锡智把日记本阖上，望着无边的草原，嘴里叨咕着：
    “这是多么好的草呀，一公斤草就能换来一公斤牛奶！”他已经深深地爱上了这片美丽的草原，爱上了自己在这个草原上所从事的全部工作。
    “吃吧，趁着这个大好的季节！”他走到牛跟前去，看着牛吃草。
    就在这个时候，他发现前边的牛把草踩倒，后边的牛就不想吃，挺好的草踩坏了，牛还吃得慢。怎样才能不踩坏草呢？他想：不能把一群牛乱放，应当把它们排成一行，挨着往前走。因为牛吃草的习惯是一步一步向前直走，不拐弯。可是，牛不了解他的意图，不愿排着队吃草。孙锡智就慢慢地引导，训练它们。时间长了，牛居然能排成长长的一行，同时向前推进。孙锡智把这叫作“一条鞭式的放牧法”。
    孙锡智把全部精力放在牛身上。他总是仔细地看着牛怎么吃草，怎么走动。起初，他发现牛总是背着太阳走。他试探着把一头牛牵过来，让它向着太阳。这不行，因为它睁不开眼睛，看不见草。背着太阳，眼睛却睁得挺大。他还摸到一条规律：牛老是迎着风走。他想，这是什么道理呢？孙锡智又试探着把牛倒过来，让它顺着风走，但是马上就看到它眼睛周围，落满了瞎虻、蚊子，咬的它不得安静。调转来，迎着风一走，瞎虻、蚊子都叫风吹走了。他还注意到，在下雨的时候，既没有太阳晒，又没有瞎虻、蚊子，如果它还是迎着风走，雨点子又会淋的它睁不开眼。所以，每逢下雨，牛总是顺着风走。孙锡智每天都是按照这三条规律，根据天气的变化，决定选择哪一块草地，向什么方向前进。
    场里技术员研究了他这些放牧方法，认为是合理的，于是给他总结成这样两句话：“迎风背太阳，雨天顺风放。”
    晚上，孙锡智发现牛站也站不定，卧也卧不好，他一看，立刻就感觉到又是蚊子捣乱。“宿舍里都是点着草辫子熏蚊子，难道不能给牛熏熏蚊子吗？”想到这里，他立刻抱来一些干草，又在上面盖上湿草，在上风头点起来，烟刮到牛群里，果然把蚊子赶跑了，孙锡智非常高兴。
    一天晚上，孙锡智又发现牛不大安静，以为又是蚊子咬的。出来一看，烟挺大，一头牛在吐白沫。病了吗？他急得头上直冒汗，就牵着它蹓蹓。走出这个烟熏地带以后，牛好了。原来是烟太大了，这样也会把牛熏坏的。
    过半夜，孙锡智又出来看他的牛。风，凉咝咝地，好不清爽，草叶上落满了露水，一个蚊子都没有，——这不正是放牛的好时光吗？得到了队长的批准以后，他把放牧时间改为早出、晚归、中间休息。
    四
    由于细心的关怀，孙锡智喂的乳牛比全场平均产量高40％，因此，1955年他参加了全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。这一年，产量最高的一头牛曾经产奶6，463公斤，今年，他计划让这头牛产奶7，500公斤。他放牧的所有的牛的平均产奶量也将由去年的3，792公斤，提高到今年的五千公斤。当然，这是需要付出更多的劳动和智慧才能争取得的。
