	Voices of the Workers
	The Difficulty of Producing New Products
	I am a worker at the Jinan Glass Products Factory. We produce a large number of glass products needed by the people every day, but we also feel that glass products are far from meeting the needs of rural development. In February this year, the factory sent people to the countryside to listen to the farmers' feedback and brought back many valuable opinions from the masses of farmers. For example, some farmers said: Bamboo-cased thermos bottles are good, but they are too slender. When taken to the fields and placed on the ground, they are easily blown over by the wind, and they are even more likely to break on hillsides. It would be more suitable for use in the fields if this kind of thermos bottle could be made shorter and stouter. Some farmers also said: "Now cooperatives are engaged in collective production, so thermos bottles should also be made larger, which would be more convenient for carrying water to and from the fields." Some even questioned: "Since you can produce insulated thermos bottles, why can't you make insulated lunch boxes?" The factory carefully studied these opinions of the farmers and immediately began the trial production of new products. All the workers in our factory felt honored and excited to be trial-producing new products for our farmer brothers.
	Our factory cannot do sand casting, and there are no molds for trial-producing new products, so the technicians and workers thought of using wood as a temporary substitute for metal molds. Finally, we successfully trial-produced short and stout five-pound, eight-pound, and ten-pound thermos bottles. We are welcoming the new products to be put into production with a sense of excitement. I think: Soon a large number of short and stout thermos bottles will be shipped to the countryside. At that time, our farmer brothers will definitely say: The workers are really considerate of the farmers and support us everywhere!
	However, a month, two months passed, and the metal molds have not yet arrived. We asked the factory leaders, and he said: Sand casting molds are difficult to make. Large factories won't do it, and small factories can't do it. The private Dayi Iron Factory, which used to make molds, is now a joint state-private enterprise and has started planned production and no longer processes for us. In order to make new product molds, the factory sends people around to negotiate almost every day, but it still can't find a factory to process them for us. We asked the Shandong Provincial Department of Industry to find a solution, and the Department of Industry arranged for a iron factory that has no pig iron to make the molds. When we went to the Department of Industry to request help in solving the pig iron problem, the person in charge of the Department of Industry said: "There is no pig iron here, you should find a way yourselves!" The factory leaders could not get pig iron and had to worry. In this way, the products that have already been successfully trial-produced cannot be mass-produced simply because of the lack of molds. How anxious the workers are about this!
	After the short and stout thermos bottles were successfully trial-produced with wooden molds, the Governor of Shandong Province encouraged us in a report at a meeting; when the samples were exhibited, they also attracted the attention of the audience. Dazhong Daily and Jinan Worker's Daily also published the news that we had successfully trial-produced short and stout thermos bottles. Jinan Worker's Daily also said that they would be shipped to the countryside in large quantities in April this year. Who knew that even the molds for producing this product had not been made in April! Recently, Rural Dazhong Daily published the news of the successful trial production of short and stout thermos bottles again, with a photo attached, and said that this product would meet with the farmer brothers in May. However, the molds for manufacturing new products have not yet arrived at the factory. It is both an exhibition and a newspaper report, but the product is delayed, wouldn't it disappoint the expectations of the farmer brothers?
	Recently, the factory leaders were so anxious that they ordered a white iron mold for short and stout thermos bottles (five pounds), which is ten times more expensive than pig iron. It is said that the factory that made the white iron mold reworked it more than ten times before it was made. Finally, with the support and help of the Shandong Agricultural Machinery Factory, they promised to sand cast eight-pound and ten-pound short thermos bottle molds for us soon. It is hard to imagine that a simple iron mold took so much effort. If solving the mold problem is like this, I don't know how many difficulties the other new products trial-produced by the factory, such as heated vegetable boxes, heated lunch boxes, glass water wheel pipes, glass basins, etc., will encounter! It is strange that the leadership vigorously calls on workers to trial-produce new products, but when new products are successfully trial-produced, when encountering difficulties that are not difficult to solve in the production of new products, they do not actively help solve them in a timely manner. We eagerly expect the industrial department and other higher-level leading departments to often pay attention to the difficulties encountered in manufacturing new products and help solve them in a timely manner, that is, to specifically support the workers' creation and production to the end.

	Subordinate to the Overall Interest, Develop Potential
	The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau signed a contract with the Shenyang Bridge Factory in the first quarter of 1955, ordering sixteen 500-ton hydraulic jacks from the factory. The parts of this product need to be forged with a hydraulic press, and the factory entrusted the 443 Factory, which has this equipment, to forge all the forged steel parts. After consultation and agreement among the three parties, it was stipulated that the Shenyang Bridge Factory would deliver all sixteen hydraulic jacks to the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau by March 5 this year. However, it has not been delivered so far. These sixteen hydraulic jacks are the key tools for erecting steel beams. The Yangtze River Bridge plans to start erecting the first span of steel beams on May 15. Because the sixteen 500-ton hydraulic jacks cannot arrive in time, it will seriously affect the steel beam erection project of the Yangtze River Bridge. We request the Shenyang Bridge Factory and the Deputy Director of the Railway Engineering General Bureau, the superior department of the factory, to pay attention to this matter and quickly deliver the sixteen hydraulic jacks to us.
	The 443 Factory has a complete set of models for manufacturing hydraulic jacks. Because the right bank beam erection project of the Yangtze River Bridge needs them, we submitted an order request to the 443 Factory in November last year to order another eight 500-ton hydraulic jacks. However, the factory did not consider how to rationally arrange production and further develop the potential of the equipment, but refused to accept our order on the grounds that the tasks were full. From November last year to March this year, we negotiated with the factory many times without results. We had to find the Nankou Railway Factory and the Tangshan Iron Factory to undertake the manufacturing in late April. However, due to insufficient equipment, the Tangshan Iron Factory will change the forged steel parts to cast steel parts, and the first one will be trial-produced by the end of July. The right bank beam erection of the Yangtze River Bridge will start in early October. Whether the quality of this key tool meets the technical requirements after changing the design and trial production, and whether the time can guarantee the needs of the project, are still uncertain. We hope that the 443 Factory will give full play to the potential of the equipment, accept our order, and work hard to jointly complete the national plan.

	Hope to Fulfill the Contract and Deliver on Time
	On March 14 this year, the Materials Factory of Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau signed a contract with the Zhuzhou Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory to order 112 bridge bearings and 228 cast steel parts for double-arm cranes used for assembling and riveting steel beams, a total of 340 pieces. According to the contract, the Zhuzhou Factory should deliver all the orders by May 10. The raw materials required for the castings are the responsibility of the Zhuzhou Factory to supply. Because the left bank of the bridge is scheduled to install crossbeam bearings on May 1 according to the progress plan, the contract also stipulates that the Zhuzhou Factory should deliver 32 bridge bearings on April 10, so that our factory can then deliver them to the Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory for processing before they are used on the project.
	However, the Zhuzhou Factory telegraphed on April 4 that they did not have low-phosphorus pig iron and could not cast the ordered castings, and asked us to assist in solving the problem. Our factory applied to the Ministry of Railways for 60 tons of low-phosphorus pig iron and shipped it to the factory in succession. However, the factory only delivered six bridge bearings on April 10, so our factory could not supply the Jiang'an factory with processed castings, and the bridge project on the left bank of the bridge could not proceed and was waiting for the bearings to arrive. Our factory called the Zhuzhou Factory every day, but they did not give a positive answer. It was not until we sent people to Zhuzhou to urge them that they delivered 22 bearings and 62 double-arm crane parts. Now they say that they lack manganese iron and cannot cast, delaying the delivery of the remaining 256 orders.
	The Zhuzhou Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory does not fulfill the contract and does not deliver on time, so the Yangtze River Bridge project cannot proceed as planned. We ask the Zhuzhou Factory to earnestly fulfill the contract and work together to complete the Yangtze River Bridge project ahead of schedule.

    职工们的呼声
    生产新产品的困难
    我是济南玻璃制品工人。我们每天生产着大量为人们所需要的玻璃用品，但是我们也特别感到玻璃制品还远远跟不上农村发展的需要。今年二月间，厂里派人到农村，听了听农民的反映，从农民群众中带回来很多宝贵意见。譬如有些农民说：竹壳热水瓶好是好，就是细长，提到田间放在地上，容易被风吹倒，要是放在山坡上更容易跌碎，如能把这种热水瓶造得粗矮些，在田间使用就合适了。还有的农民说：“现在合作社都是集体生产，热水瓶也该制造大一些，上下地提水就更方便了。”甚至有人质问：“既然能生产保温的热水瓶，为什么不能制造保暖的饭菜盒呢？”。厂里认真研究农民的这些意见，马上开始了新产品的试制工作。我们全厂工人都为给农民兄弟试制新产品而感到光荣和兴奋。
    我们厂里不能翻砂，试制新产品没有模子，技术人员和工人们就想办法暂时用木头来代替金属模子，终于把粗矮的五磅、八磅、十磅热水瓶试制成功了。我们怀着一种兴奋的心情，来迎接新产品投入生产。我想：不久会有大批粗矮的热水瓶运往农村，那时，农民兄弟一定会说：还是工人老大哥肯替农民着想，处处支援我们！
    但是，一个月，两个月过去了，金属模子还没有来，我们问厂里的领导同志，他说：翻砂模子可难啦，大厂子不给做，小厂子做不了，过去做模子的私营大章铁工厂，现在公私合营了，开始了计划生产，不再给我们加工了。厂里为了做新产品模子，几乎每天都派人到处交涉，却始终找不着一个厂子给我们加工。请山东工业厅给想办法，工业厅给安排到一个没有生铁的铁工厂做，再去工业厅请求帮助解决生铁问题时，工业厅的负责人说：“这里没有生铁，还是你们自己想办法吧！”厂的领导人搞不到生铁，只好干着急。就这样，已经试制成功的产品，只因为缺模子而不能大量生产。为这事，工人们是多么着急啊！
    粗矮的热水瓶用木头作模子试制成功后，山东省省长在一个会议上的报告中鼓励过我们；展览样品时，也受到了观众注意，大众日报和济南工人报上也都发了我们试制成功粗矮热水瓶的消息。济南工人报还说今年四月份就大量运往农村，谁知四月份连生产这种产品的模子还没有造出来呢！最近农村大众报上又登了试制粗矮热水瓶成功的消息，并附有照片，又说五月份这种产品就要和农民兄弟见面了。可是，到现在制造新产品的模子仍没有到厂。又是展览，又是登报，可是迟迟不见产品，岂不辜负了农民兄弟的期望吗？
    最近厂里领导人实在急不过，就订造了一个白铁的粗矮热水瓶模子（五磅的），价钱比生铁的贵十倍，据说这家造白铁模子的工厂，返工了十多次才造成。最后得到山东农具厂的支持和帮助，答应最近给我们翻砂八磅、十磅的矮热水瓶模子。很难想像：一个简单的铁模子，却费了这么大劲。如果都像解决模子问题这样，厂里试制的另外一些新产品如暖菜盒、暖饭盒、玻璃水车管子、玻璃脸盆等等，还不知要遇到多少难题呢！这就奇怪：领导上起劲地号召工人试制新产品，新产品试制成功了，但在生产新产品时却遇到并不是难以解决的困难的时候，却又不积极地帮助及时解决。我们殷切的期待着工业厅等上级领导部门能经常注意制造新产品中遇到的困难，并帮助及时解决，也就是说：对工人的创造和生产要具体地支持到底。

    服从整体利益，发挥潜力
    武汉长江大桥工程局在1955年第一季度同沈阳桥梁厂签订合同，向该厂订制五百吨油压千斤顶十六台。这项产品的部件需用水压机锻制，该厂又委托有此项设备的四四三厂代为锻制全部锻钢部件。经三方协商同意，规定今年三月五日前由沈阳桥梁厂将十六台油压千斤顶全部交给武汉长江大桥工程局。但是至今仍未交付。这十六台油压千斤顶是我们架设钢梁的关键性工具。长江大桥计划在五月十五日开始架设第一联钢梁，由于十六台五百吨的油压千斤顶不能及时到达，势必严重影响长江大桥架梁工程。我们要求沈阳桥梁厂和该厂的上级主管部门——铁道部工程总局副业处对此事重视起来，赶快将十六台油压千斤顶交给我们。
    四四三厂拥有制造油压千斤顶的全套模型。因为长江大桥右岸架梁工程需用，我们在去年十一月向四四三厂提出再订制八台五百吨油压千斤顶的订货要求。但该厂不考虑如何合理安排生产，进一步发挥设备潜力，而以任务排满为理由，拒绝接受我们这项订货。从去年十一月到今年三月，我们向该厂交涉多次都没有结果。我们只好在四月下旬找南口铁路工厂和唐山铁工厂承制。但是，唐山铁工厂因为设备不足，要将锻钢件改为铸钢件，同时七月底才能试制出第一台来。长江大桥右岸架梁从十月初开始，这项关键性工具改变设计试制后，质量是否合乎技术要求，时间能否保证工程需用，都还没有把握。我们希望四四三厂充分发挥设备潜力，接受我们这项订货，为共同完成国家计划而努力。

    希望履行合同，按期交货
    武汉长江大桥工程局材料厂在今年三月十四日同株州机车车辆修理工厂签订合同，向该厂订制桥梁支座112件、拼铆钢梁用的双臂吊车铸钢零件228件，共340件。按照合同规定，株州工厂应在五月十日将订货全部交齐。铸件所需的原料，由株州工厂负责供应。因为大桥左岸按进度计划要在五月一日安装横梁支座，合同还规定株州工厂应在四月十日交付桥梁支座32件，以便由我厂再交江岸机车车辆修理工厂加工后，即用到工程上去。
    可是株州厂却在四月四日来电说他们没有低磷生铁，所订的铸件没法翻铸，要我们协助解决。我厂就向铁道部申请了六十吨低磷生铁，陆续运到该厂。但是，该厂在四月十日只交了六件桥梁支座，使我厂没法供应江岸工厂加工铸件，大桥左岸桥梁工程不能进行，停工等待支座。我厂每日与株州工厂通电话，他们也不正面答复。直到我们派人赴株州督催，他们才交了二十二件支座、六十二件双臂吊车零件。现在他们又说缺锰铁没法翻铸，拖延不交其余的256件订货。
    株州机车车辆修理工厂不履行合同，不按期交货，使长江大桥工程不能按计划进行。我们要求株州工厂，认真履行合同，共同为提前完成长江大桥工程而努力。
