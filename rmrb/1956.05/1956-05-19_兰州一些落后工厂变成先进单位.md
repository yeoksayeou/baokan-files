    Some backward factories, workshops, and departments in Lanzhou have become advanced units in the advanced producer movement.

    In early May, the Lanzhou Sand Quarry, Lanzhou Wood Factory, and eight other factories, which were rewarded and commended by the Lanzhou Municipal Bureau of Industry, were mostly factories that frequently failed to meet their production plans in the past. Since the beginning of this year, these factories have strengthened their leadership, earnestly mobilized the masses, and promptly solved the workers' living problems, thus rapidly changing their backward situation.

    The Lanzhou Sand Quarry and six other factories comprehensively completed their production plans in the first quarter. The large work section of the machining workshop of the state-owned Lanzhou General Machinery Factory, which frequently failed to complete its production tasks in the past, has exceeded its production plan every month since the beginning of this year, and its scrap rate has also been reduced from 4.41% to 1.51%, thanks to the improvement of several tools by lathe operators Mu Peitang, Zhou Wenfu, and Yang Dianjie.

    The general affairs section of the state-owned Gansu Agricultural Implement Manufacturing Factory, which was previously the most unsatisfactory place for the factory's workers, improved the workers' meals during the advanced producer movement. The cooks paid attention to changing the variety of dishes, ensuring that workers did not eat the same food within seven days; the general affairs section personnel took the initiative to solve the workers' difficulties, sent special personnel to each workshop to deliver boiled water to the workers, helped the workers clean their dormitories, etc. As a result, this section was rated as an advanced department in the factory in April and received a reward.

    兰州一些落后工厂变成先进单位
    兰州市有些落后的工厂、车间和科室，在先进生产者运动中变成了先进单位。
    五月上旬，受到兰州市工业局奖励和表扬的兰州采砂厂、兰州木器厂等十个工厂，过去大部分是生产计划经常不能完成的工厂。这些工厂今年以来，由于加强了领导，认真发动了群众，并且及时解决了工人的生活问题，因而迅速改变了落后的状况。
    兰州采砂厂等六个工厂，第一季度全面完成了生产计划。过去经常完不成生产任务的国营兰州通用机器厂加工车间大型工段，由于车工穆培棠、周文福和杨殿杰等改进了好几种工具，今年以来，月月超额完成生产计划，废品率也由过去的4.41％降低到1.51％。
    过去为本厂工人最不满意的地方国营甘肃农具制造厂总务科，在先进生产者运动中改善了工人伙食，炊事员注意变换饭菜花样，做到七天之内不让工人吃相同的饭菜；总务科人员主动替工人解决困难，派专人到各车间给工人送开水，帮助工人清洁宿舍等，因而这个科四月间被评为全厂的先进科室，受到了奖励。    　　　（新华社）
