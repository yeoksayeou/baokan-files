The scandal of racial discrimination in the United States

In recent years, with the support of progressive white mass organizations, the movement of American blacks against racial discrimination has been on the rise. Due to strong international and domestic public opinion pressure, the U.S. Supreme Court had to make successive decisions in 1954 and 1955 to abolish racial segregation in schools and public places. However, this decision aroused fierce opposition from American racists, including the governors and congressmen of many southern states. Recently, in the southern states where racial discrimination has always been most rampant, racists have refused to implement this decision and have used various means to strengthen discrimination and persecution against blacks. The University of Alabama scandal, which caused a stir in world public opinion, is a typical example of many discriminatory incidents.

This happened in the spring of this year. The story is this: Although part of the funding for the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, southern United States, comes from taxes paid by blacks, it has always closed its doors to blacks for 125 years since its founding. At the beginning of the new semester in early February this year, a black girl, Autherine Lucy, appeared on the registration list for the first time.

Lucy is the daughter of a black tenant farmer in Alabama. As early as the summer of 1952, she applied to the Library Science Department of the University of Alabama but was rejected by the school authorities. In order to fight for the right to study equally with whites, Lucy, with the assistance of the "National Association for the Advancement of Colored People," the center of the black movement, sued the federal court. After three and a half years of legal struggle, she finally won the right to enter the University of Alabama as the first black student. The school deliberately made things difficult for her, not allowing her to live on campus or dine in the university cafeteria, but Lucy insisted on coming to school from Birmingham, sixty miles away, every day.

From the day Lucy officially started school on February 3, local racists held demonstrations for several consecutive nights. They surrounded the campus, lit crosses symbolizing the Ku Klux Klan's signal for action, and shouted slogans such as "Lucy get out" and "Alabama for whites." Thugs also attacked cars carrying blacks on the streets and injured passengers.

The thugs' demonstrations did not scare Lucy, so they decided to resort to violence. On February 6, hundreds of thugs gathered in front of the building where Lucy was attending classes, shouting in unison: "Hey, hey, ho, ho, Lucy must get out." After Lucy finished class, the thugs swarmed up, verbally abused her in every possible way, threatened to kill her, and threw rotten eggs and stones at her. A large number of police officers were present at the time, but they did not stop the thugs' actions.

After the incident, the school authorities, on the pretext of ensuring Lucy's safety and the safety of the school, suspended Lucy's schooling. Lucy once again filed a complaint with the federal court, accusing the school authorities of contempt of court and demanding immediate reinstatement and permission to live on campus and use the cafeteria. Lucy's complaint was supported by progressive American public opinion. In early March, the federal court ruled in Lucy's favor. However, on the very day that Lucy returned to school, the school authorities, on the pretext that Lucy's complaint was "despicable, defamatory, and unfounded," announced the formal expulsion of Lucy from school.

The nature of the University of Alabama incident was so vile that it was met with fierce condemnation from all sides, even in that country where racial discrimination is rampant. Even some bourgeois newspapers such as the "New York Journal-American" felt that it should be condemned, believing that the racists' behavior was "an insult to dignity and democracy." Congressman Powell, a black man who attended the Bandung Conference as an "observer" and was once used by the U.S. government to promote "American civilization," finally realized how contrary to the facts it was for him to issue an "optimistic report" on the situation of American blacks last year. Student groups from many universities in the northern United States protested one after another, and 500 students at the University of Alabama signed a petition demanding that Lucy be allowed to return to school.

This scandal of American racists persecuting black female students has also aroused widespread criticism and ridicule internationally. This prompted the United States Information Service stationed in European countries to rush to provide the press with background material on the American black problem, in order to whitewash American "democracy." But this "pot calling the kettle black" approach did nothing to enhance the reputation of the "American way of life." United Press reported that the cry of "Hey, hey, ho, ho, Autherine must get out" at the University of Alabama caused "embarrassing reactions" in many countries.

In order to ease domestic and international public opinion, the University of Alabama had no choice but to expel Wilson, the student who instigated the demonstration. But the racists have received the support of certain powerful figures in the United States. Georgia Governor Griffin has guaranteed that Wilson can attend any university at will. Southern congressmen in Washington's Congress have introduced bills to overturn the Supreme Court's ruling on abolishing segregation. And the Alabama House of Representatives has also passed many laws and resolutions to continue to maintain racial discrimination, and threatened to subpoena Lucy, asking her to say whether the "National Association for the Advancement of Colored People" is an organization "led and controlled by the Communists." In addition, the University of Alabama was also required to hand over the list of students who signed the petition demanding that Lucy be reinstated. At the same time, the Tuscaloosa court also sentenced two black youths who had defended Lucy to ten months in prison.

The University of Alabama incident has not ended. It has become part of the rising black movement for democracy in the United States. (Lin Longtie)

### 美国种族歧视的丑闻

    美国种族歧视的丑闻
    近几年来，在进步的白人群众团体支持下，美国黑人反对种族歧视的运动日益高涨。由于国际和国内舆论的强大压力，美国最高法院不得不在1954年和1955年连续作出了取消学校和公共场所种族隔离的决定。但是这项决定引起了美国的种族主义者，包括南方许多州的州长和国会议员的激烈反对。最近以来，在历来种族歧视最为猖獗的南部各州，种族主义者拒绝执行这项决定，并且使用各种手段加强对黑人的歧视和迫害活动。哄动世界舆论的阿拉巴马大学丑闻，就是许多歧视事件中的一个典型例子。
    这件事情发生在今年春天里。事情是这样的：美国南部德斯加卢萨城阿拉巴马大学，虽然学校经费有一部分来自黑人缴纳的赋税，但是建校125年以来，始终对黑人关起大门。今年二月初新学期开始时，注册名单上第一次出现了一个黑人女生奥·露茜。
    露茜是阿拉巴马州一个黑人佃农的女儿。早在1952年夏，她就申请进阿拉巴马大学图书馆系，但被学校当局拒绝。为了争取同白种人平等学习的权利，在黑人运动中心组织“全国有色人种协进会”协助下，露茜向联邦法院起诉，经过三年半法律斗争，她终于争得了作为第一个黑人学生进入阿拉巴马大学的权利。校方故意刁难，不许她在校住宿和在大学食堂用膳，但是露茜每天坚持从六十英里以外的伯明罕来校上学。
    从二月三日露茜正式上学的那一天起，当地的种族主义者就接连几个晚上举行示威，他们包围了校园，燃起表示三K党徒行动信号的十字架，高喊“露茜滚蛋”和“白人的阿拉巴马”的口号。暴徒们还在大街上袭击黑人乘坐的汽车，殴伤乘客。
    暴徒的示威没有吓倒露茜，于是他们决定采取暴力。二月六日，数百名暴徒聚集在露茜上课的大楼前，齐声高嚷：“嘿，嘿，嗬，嗬，露茜必须滚蛋”。露茜下课后，暴徒们蜂拥而上，对她百般辱骂，威吓要杀死她，并向她投掷臭鸡蛋和石块。当时有大批警察在场，但是他们对暴徒的行动不加制止。
    事件发生后，学校当局借口为了露茜的安全以及学校的安全，停止露茜上学。露茜再度向联邦法院指控学校当局藐视法院的法令，要求立即复学，并许她在校住宿和使用食堂。露茜的控诉得到美国进步舆论的支持。三月初联邦法院判决露茜胜诉。但是就在露茜回校的这一天，学校当局竟然借口露茜的控诉是“卑劣的、污蔑性的和没有根据的”。宣布正式开除露茜学籍。
    阿拉巴马大学事件的性质是如此丑恶，以至在那个种族歧视盛行的国家里，也受到了各方面舆论的猛烈谴责。连一些资产阶级的报纸像“纽约日报与美国人”也觉得应该加以谴责，认为种族主义者的行为是“对尊严和民主的一种侮辱”。曾以“观察员”身份出席万隆会议、美国政府曾用他来宣扬“美国文明”的黑人众议员鲍威尔也终于感觉到，他像去年那样对美国黑人处境发表“乐观的报告”是如何地违反事实。美国北部许多大学的学生团体纷纷提出抗议，阿拉巴马大学五百名学生签名要求允许露茜回校。
    美国种族主义者这一迫害黑人女学生的丑闻，在国际上也引起了广泛抨击和嘲笑。这使得驻在欧洲国家的美国新闻处，匆忙地向报界提供了一个有关美国黑人问题的背景材料，为美国的“民主”进行粉饰。但是这种“此地无银三百两”的做法丝毫也不能增加“美国生活方式”的声誉。合众社报道说，“阿拉巴马大学嘿、嘿，嗬，嗬，奥特琳必须滚蛋”的叫嚷声在许多国家里引起了“令人难堪的反应”。
    为了缓和国内外舆论，阿拉巴马大学不得已开除了煽动示威的主谋学生威尔逊。但是种族主义者却得到美国某些有势力人物的支持。乔治亚州的州长格里芬保证威尔逊可以随意进任何大学上学，在华盛顿国会中的南方议员提出议案，要推翻最高法院关于取消隔离制度的裁决，而阿拉巴马州的众议院也通过了许多继续维持种族歧视的法令和决议，并且威胁要传讯露茜，要她说出“全国有色人种协进会”是否是被“共产党领导和控制”的组织，此外，还要阿拉巴马大学交出签名要求让露茜复学的学生名单等。与此同时，德斯加卢萨法院还将两名曾经卫护了露茜的黑人青年判处十个月徒刑。
    阿拉巴马大学事件并没有结束，它已成为美国国内正在高涨中的黑人争取民主运动的一部分。　（林龙铁）
