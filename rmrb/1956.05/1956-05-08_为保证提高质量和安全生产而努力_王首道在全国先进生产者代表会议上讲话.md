　　Strive to Ensure Improved Quality and Safe Production
    Wang Shoudao's Speech at the National Conference of Advanced Producers
    Wang Shoudao, Director of the Sixth Office of the State Council, in his speech at the National Conference of Advanced Producers on the 7th, requested that all employees of the transportation and postal and telecommunications departments treat their work with a serious attitude of responsibility to the socialist construction of the motherland and to the people, and strive to ensure improved quality and safe production.

    Wang Shoudao pointed out: Poor quality is the most prominent problem in the current work of the transportation and postal and telecommunications departments. He said that in implementing the central government's policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical," it is necessary to consider both the objective need for more and faster, and at the same time, to place more and faster on a reliable foundation, and to seek more and faster on the premise of better and more economical. Isolating and unilaterally emphasizing any one aspect will bring losses to the country and the people. He requested that all tasks in the transportation and postal and telecommunications departments formulate practical and feasible plans, and proceed step by step in accordance with a unified plan. The leaders of each unit should also promptly analyze the key issues and weak links in production, and point out to the workers and masses the goals of continuous improvement in quality.

    In his speech, Wang Shoudao detailed the achievements of China's transportation and postal and telecommunications departments in recent years. He said that in recent years, the employees of China's transportation and postal and telecommunications departments have basically met the needs of national economic development for transportation and communication, and have systematically carried out and completed many large-scale construction projects. As of the end of 1955, the total mileage of railways in China had reached 27,000 kilometers; the total mileage of highways had reached 150,000 kilometers; the deadweight tonnage of tugboats and barges had greatly increased; civil aviation had established air links between the capital and major cities across the country, and had opened international routes to the Soviet Union, Vietnam, and Burma; long-distance telecommunication lines had reached 144,500 pole-kilometer, and direct communication circuits had been established with 43 countries. In terms of freight volume, compared with 1950, the railway turnover volume in 1955 increased by 1.47 times, water transport increased by 8.8 times, and automobile transport increased by 5.7 times. Postal and telecommunications business volume increased to 154% in 1955, taking 1952 as 100. In basic construction projects, the transportation construction engineering teams fully demonstrated the working class's indomitable heroic spirit. They made high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way, opening up broad roads in the snow-capped mountains, grasslands, barren valleys, and deep rivers for the beautiful future of the motherland. All these achievements were created by the hard work of more than 1.6 million employees of the transportation and postal and telecommunications departments, as well as the engineering units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the broad masses of civilian workers, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government.

    After introducing a group of the most outstanding advanced figures who have emerged in the transportation and postal and telecommunications departments, Wang Shoudao pointed out: The achievements made in the past few years are only a good start compared to the great prospect of building a modern, well-connected transportation and postal and telecommunications network. Arduous and glorious tasks still lie ahead.

    Wang Shoudao then talked about the current tasks of the transportation and postal and telecommunications departments and how to further develop the advanced producer movement in the transportation and postal and telecommunications departments. He said that employees of the transportation department must strive to increase the amount of transportation, accelerate the turnover of vehicles and ships, improve the quality of transportation, reduce transportation costs, and ensure the safe and timely arrival of passenger and freight transportation. Employees of the postal and telecommunications departments should continuously improve their technical and work levels, ensure the convenience, safety, accuracy, timeliness, and completeness of postal and telecommunications communications, and eliminate errors. Employees of the transportation and postal and telecommunications basic construction departments should vigorously strengthen investigation and research, improve the quality of overall design and the efficiency of surveying and design work, improve the level of construction technology and strictly enforce operating discipline, ensure project quality, continuously reduce project costs, and eliminate all kinds of major accidents.

    Wang Shoudao emphasized the importance of strengthening cooperation among the transportation and postal and telecommunications departments. He said that the transportation and postal and telecommunications departments themselves are like a complete machine, requiring the concerted efforts of all departments. Any interruption or slackening in any link will cause uncoordination and thus suffer significant losses. Ensuring the completion of the national transportation plan and realizing rational transportation and saving national transportation capacity are also the common tasks of all departments of the national economy. On the one hand, the transportation department must first strive to do its own work well, clearly establish the idea of serving industrial and agricultural production and serving the people, take the initiative to contact relevant departments, and meet their transportation needs as much as possible; on the other hand, it also requires all departments of the national economy to care about transportation work and cherish and save the use of national transportation capacity. At the same time, industrial departments should also supply the transportation and postal and telecommunications departments with high-quality transportation tools and equipment.

    Wang Shoudao said that whether within or outside the departments, between superiors and subordinates, between left and right, and between the central and local governments, we must greatly promote the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation in the future. We welcome the emergence of more "cooperation experts," not "buck-passing experts." We must establish an overall concept among cadres and workers in all departments and oppose departmentalism.

    Wang Shoudao finally said: In order to widely and deeply develop the advanced producer movement, it is also necessary to oppose right-leaning conservative thinking, bureaucracy, and formalistic leadership styles, and emphasize that leaders at all levels go deep into production, get close to the masses, and breathe fresh air in actual life to clear their minds. Leaders at all levels must strongly support the initiatives of the workers and masses, cherish any small emerging advanced experience, promptly and conscientiously summarize and promote various advanced experiences, and reward the inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals of the workers and masses. All units should formulate practical and feasible plans for promoting the learning of new technologies and advanced experiences, and take effective measures to vigorously adhere to their implementation.

　　为保证提高质量和安全生产而努力
    王首道在全国先进生产者代表会议上讲话
    国务院第六办公室主任王首道七日在全国先进生产者代表会议上讲话的时候，要求运输和邮电部门的全体职工，应以对祖国社会主义建设和对人民负责的严肃态度，来对待自己的工作，为保证提高质量和安全生产而努力。
    王首道指出：质量不好是当前运输和邮电部门工作中最突出的问题，他说，贯彻中央“又多、又快、又好、又省”的方针，既要考虑客观需要求多、求快，同时又要把多、快放在可靠的基础上，并且要在好、省的前提下求多、求快。孤立地片面地强调那一方面都将会给国家和人民带来损失。他要求运输和邮电部门的各项工作都要制定切实可行的规划，并且按照统一的规划有步骤的进行。各单位的领导者还要及时地分析生产中的关键问题和薄弱环节情况，向职工群众指出不断提高质量的奋斗目标。
    王首道在讲话中详细讲述了我国运输和邮电部门几年来的成就。他说，几年来，我国运输和邮电部门的职工，基本上满足了国民经济发展对运输和通信的需要，并有计划地进行着和完成了许多规模巨大的建设工程。截至1955年底，我国铁路通车里程已经达到二万七千公里；公路通车里程已经达到十五万公里；轮驳船载重吨位已经大大增加；民用航空已经建立起首都和全国各大城市的空中联系，并且开辟了通往苏联、越南和缅甸的国际航线；长途电信线路已经达到十四万四千五百杆程公里，并和四十三个国家建立了直接通信的电路。在运量方面，如以1955年货物周转量和1950年比较，铁路增长一点四七倍，水运增长八点八倍，汽车运输增长五点七倍。邮电业务量如以1952年为一百，1955年增长到154％。在基本建设工程中，交通建设工程队伍，充分发挥了工人阶级百折不挠的英雄气概。他们叫高山低头，叫河水让路，在雪山草地、荒谷深川中，为祖国美好的将来开辟着宽阔的道路。所有这些成就，都是在党和政府的正确领导下，由运输和邮电部门一百六十多万职工，以及中国人民解放军工程部队和广大民工辛勤劳动创造出来的。
    王首道在介绍了运输和邮电部门新涌现出来的事迹最突出的一批先进人物以后指出：过去几年来取得的成就，同我们要建设一个现代化的四通八达的交通运输网和邮电通信网的伟大前景来说，只不过是一个良好的开端，艰巨而光荣的任务还在后面。
    王首道接着讲述了运输和邮电部门当前的任务和在运输邮电部门中如何进一步开展先进生产者运动的有关问题。他说，运输部门的职工必须努力增加运输数量，加速车、船周转，提高运输质量，降低运输成本，并且保证客货运输安全和及时到达。邮电部门的职工应该不断地提高技术水平和工作水平，保证邮电通信的便利、安全、准确、及时和完整无损，消灭差错。运输和邮电基本建设部门的职工，应该大力加强调查研究，提高总体设计质量和勘测设计工作效率，提高施工技术水平和严格操作纪律，保证工程质量，不断降低工程造价，消除各种重大事故。
    王首道强调说明了运输和邮电部门加强协作的重要意义。他说，运输和邮电部门本身也像一部完整的机器，需要各个部门的协同一致。任何一个环节的中断或松弛，都将引起不协调并且因此遭受重大损失。保证国家运输计划的完成，实现合理运输和节省国家运输力，也是国民经济各部门的共同任务。一方面，运输部门必须首先努力做好自己的工作，明确树立为工农业生产服务和为人民服务的思想，主动和各有关部门联系，尽可能地满足它们对运输的需要；另一方面，也要求国民经济各部门关心运输工作，爱护和节省使用国家的运输力。同时，工业部门也应供给运输和邮电部门质量优良的运输工具和设备。
    王首道说，无论在部内、部外、上下、左右之间，以及中央和地方，今后都要大大提倡互助合作精神。我们欢迎出现更多的“合作专家”，不要“扯皮专家”，要在各部门的干部和职工群众中树立整体观念，反对本位主义思想。
    王首道最后说：为了广泛、深入地开展先进生产者运动，还必须反对右倾保守思想、官僚主义和形式主义的领导作风，强调各级领导者深入生产、接近群众，到实际生活中去呼吸一下新鲜空气，清醒自己的头脑。各级领导者必须大力支持职工群众的创举，珍惜任何一点微小的萌芽状态的先进经验，及时地认真总结和推广各种先进经验，并且奖励职工群众的创造发明和合理化建议。各单位都应该制定切实可行的推广学习新技术和先进经验的计划，采取有效措施，大力坚持贯彻。
