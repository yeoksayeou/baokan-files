Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 23rd. Indian Prime Minister Nehru issued a statement in the People's House on May 22nd, calling for an end to the violence in Algeria and for resolving the Algerian question through negotiation and reconciliation.

The statement expressed the Indian government's regret and deep concern about the serious developments in Algeria—the increasingly aggravated use of violence and the seemingly distant prospect of an end to the conflict.

The Indian government believes that the conflict in Algeria is "part of the great tide of national awakening that has swept across Asia and Africa in the past two generations. Whatever our views may be on certain specific aspects of the current situation in Algeria, whatever the extent to which we recognize the practical difficulties and complexities involved, we and all those concerned may not fail to recognize this fundamental issue."

Nehru said: There are two basic aspects to the attitude towards national liberation movements and specifically towards the Algerian question, namely, support for the movement and adherence to peaceful methods. He recounted that at the Bandung Conference last year, India, together with other independent Asian and African countries, unanimously declared their support for the rights of the peoples of Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia to self-determination and independence, and called on the French government to achieve a peaceful resolution without delay.

Nehru said: Now, the French government has recognized the independence of Morocco and Tunisia. It is hoped that the independence of these two countries will soon be well established and that they will soon become members of the United Nations. And it is hoped that the French government will "follow the path in Algeria that has produced beneficial results in Morocco and Tunisia."

The statement expressed the Indian government's keen desire to help resolve the conflict in Algeria and put forward the following five recommendations:

One, that a climate conducive to a peaceful solution be fostered by a formal declaration by both sides of the essence of their recent statements in favor of ending violent action.

Two, that the French government recognize the national entity and personality of Algeria on a liberal basis.

Three, that the parties concerned recognize that all Algerians, regardless of race, are equal.

Four, that Algeria be recognized as the homeland of all the Algerian people, regardless of race, and that they all have the right to share in the benefits and obligations arising from the recognition of Algeria's national entity and personality and freedom.

Five, to begin direct negotiations based on the above basic concepts and in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.

    在承认阿尔及利亚民族权利的基础上和平解决阿尔及利亚问题
    印度政府建议法国和阿尔及利亚进行直接谈判
    新华社新德里23日电　印度总理尼赫鲁五月二十二日在人民院发表声明，呼吁停止在阿尔及利亚的暴力行为，用谈判和和解的方法解决阿尔及利亚问题。
    声明表示，印度政府对在阿尔及利亚严重发展的事态——日益加剧地使用暴力以及停止冲突的日子遥遥无望——表示遗憾和深切的关怀。
    印度政府认为，阿尔及利亚的冲突是“过去两代里席卷亚非两洲的民族觉醒的伟大浪潮的一部分。不论我们对于阿尔及利亚目前局势的某些特定方面可能有什么看法，不论我们对于其中所涉及的实际困难和复杂情况认识到什么程度，我们和一切有关的人可能都不会不承认这个基本问题。”
    尼赫鲁说：对待争取民族解放运动和具体地对待阿尔及利亚问题的态度有两个基本方面，那就是对运动的支持和对和平方法的遵从。他追溯说，在去年万隆会议上，印度曾经同其他亚非独立国家一致宣布它们支持阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥和突尼斯各国人民取得自决和独立的权利，并且呼吁法国政府毫不拖延地实现和平解决。
    尼赫鲁说：现在，法国政府已经承认了摩洛哥和突尼斯的独立。希望这两个国家的独立不久将很好地确立起来，它们不久将成为联合国的会员国。并且希望法国政府将在阿尔及利亚“遵循在摩洛哥和突尼斯产生了有益结果的那种道路。”
    声明表示，印度政府热切希望帮助解决在阿尔及利亚的这场冲突，并且提出以下五点建议：
    一、由双方正式宣布它们最近赞成结束暴力行动的声明的要旨，从而促进和平解决的气氛。
    二、法国政府在自由的基础上承认阿尔及利亚的民族实体和人格。
    三、有关各方承认阿尔及利亚各族人民不分种族一律平等。
    四、承认阿尔及利亚是阿尔及利亚不分种族的全体人民的祖国，而且他们都将有权利分享由于承认阿尔及利亚民族实体和人格以及自由而带来的好处和义务。
    五、开始举行以上述的基本观念为基础并且依照联合国宪章的原则的直接谈判。
