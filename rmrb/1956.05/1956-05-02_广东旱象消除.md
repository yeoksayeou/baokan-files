    Guangdong Drought Eliminated

    Guangdong Province has experienced four consecutive days of rain since April 27th. With this, the drought that lasted for nearly a month throughout the province has been eliminated. Currently, farmers are harrowing fields and transplanting rice seedlings after the rain, striving to complete the transplanting of early rice seedlings before "Lixia" (May 5th) as originally planned.

    Of the 34 million mu of early rice fields in Guangdong Province, over 26 million mu have already been planted during the drought resistance effort, leaving only 8 million mu to be transplanted.

    广东旱象消除
    广东省自四月二十七日起，一连下了四天雨。至此，全省持续将近一个月的旱象已告消除。目前，农民正在雨后耙田和插秧，争取按照原定在“立夏”（五月五日）以前将早稻秧下插完毕。
    广东省三千四百多万亩的早稻田，在抗旱中已抢插了二千六百多万亩，现待插的只有八百万亩。
