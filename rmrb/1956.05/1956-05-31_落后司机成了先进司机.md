    Backward Driver Becomes Advanced Driver
    Li Meichun, a driver of passenger bus No. 138 from the Nanjing Jiangnan Automobile Company, has transformed from a backward driver who failed to complete his tasks month after month for more than four consecutive years to an advanced driver who consistently overfulfills his monthly targets.
    Li Meichun has been driving for over a decade, but his technical progress has been slow because he was unwilling to learn advanced techniques. In the past, the coal consumption of the vehicles he drove exceeded the target by nearly ten kilograms per hundred kilometers, and he experienced breakdowns five or six times a month. A battery was supposed to last for eight months, but in the second half of 1955, he damaged fifteen of them in less than five months, resulting in a loss of over four hundred yuan for this item alone. In December 1955, after he was transferred to the Second Squad of the Third Team, the squad leader, Jing Guangsheng, assigned him to use vehicle No. 138 with himself on the same shift. Jing Guangsheng helped him to overcome his conservative thinking, and organized eight advanced workers to observe his driving and help him improve his operations. Since the beginning of this year, Li Meichun has not experienced a single breakdown, nor has he damaged a single battery. He has also exceeded the targets for on-time arrival and coal consumption, saving the country four hundred and eighty yuan. As a result, Li Meichun was recognized by the company as a third-class advanced producer. Passenger bus No. 138, driven by him and Jing Guangsheng, has also been named an advanced vehicle.

    落后司机成了先进司机
    南京江南汽车公司138号客车司机李枚春由连续四年多月月完不成任务的落后司机转变成为月月超额完成任务的先进司机。
    李枚春驾驶汽车已经有十几年，但是由于他不愿意学习先进经验，技术进步很慢。他过去驾驶的车子，每百公里煤耗要超过指标近十公斤，每月要抛锚五、六次；一只电瓶规定用八个月，他在1955年下半年不到五个月就损坏了十五只，单这一项就损失四百多元。1955年12月，他被调到三车队二小队工作以后，小队长景光胜分配他和自己同班使用138号车。景光胜帮助他打破了保守思想，并且组织八个先进工人跟车观摩，帮助他改进操作。今年以来，李枚春从没有抛过一次锚，也没有坏过一只电瓶，还超额完成了线路准点和煤耗的指标，为国家节约了四百八十元。因此，李枚春被公司评为三等先进生产者。他和景光胜驾驶的138号客车，也被评为先进汽车。（本报驻南京记者）
