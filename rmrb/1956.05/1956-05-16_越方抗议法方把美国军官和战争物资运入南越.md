Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 14th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army stationed at the Vietnam Central Joint Armistice Commission strongly protested against the other side for allowing the continuous transportation of US military personnel and war materials into South Vietnam.

    This protest was made in a letter sent to the delegation of the General Command of the French Federal Forces on May 8th.

    The letter pointed out that from January 30th to March 9th, 1956, US aircraft had repeatedly carried large numbers of US military officers and other military personnel, as well as large quantities of war materials, to South Vietnam. Recently, many senior US military officers have come to Saigon to supervise the implementation of the US plan to expand the South Vietnamese armed forces. US Deputy Secretary of Defense Robertson is also scheduled to visit Saigon at the end of May to inspect the general military situation in South Vietnam.

    The Vietnamese side requests the French side to take measures to stop all practices of transporting military personnel and war materials into South Vietnam, and all activities aimed at realizing a military alliance between US imperialism and the South Vietnamese government, and to take appropriate measures regarding the military personnel and war materials that have already been transported into South Vietnam.

    越方抗议法方把美国军官和战争物资运入南越
    新华社河内14日电　据越南通讯社报道：越南人民军总司令部驻越南中央联合停战委员会代表团强硬抗议对方容许把美国军事人员和战争物资不断运入南越。
    这个抗议是在五月八日送交法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表团的一封信中提出来的。
    这封信指出，从1956年一月三十日到三月九日，美国飞机曾经多次载运大量美国军官和其他军事人员以及大量战争物资到南越。最近，有许多美国高级军官到西贡来监督美国扩充南越武装部队计划的执行情况。美国国防部副部长罗伯逊也预定在五月底到西贡来检查南越的一般军事局势。
    越南方面要求法国方面采取措施停止把军事人员和战争物资运入南越的一切作法和以实现美帝国主义和南越政府之间的军事同盟为目的的一切活动，并且对已经被运入南越的军事人员和战争物资采取适当的措施。
