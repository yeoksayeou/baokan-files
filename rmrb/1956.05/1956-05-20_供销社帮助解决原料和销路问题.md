Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Help Solve Raw Material and Sales Problems

    Supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Henan Province are actively helping agricultural production cooperatives develop sideline production. As of early May, supply and marketing cooperatives in the Xuchang area had supplied agricultural cooperatives with more than 250,000 yuan worth of production raw materials such as iron, brambles, and reeds for processing and production. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Xinyang, Kaifeng, and other areas have extensively signed contracts with local agricultural cooperatives to help solve the problems of raw materials and sales of sideline products. The Xiping County Supply and Marketing Cooperative alone has signed more than 1,400 sideline product processing contracts with agricultural cooperatives.
    Supply and marketing cooperatives in various localities have also strengthened the purchase of sideline products. In Hudian Township, Shangcai County, there were originally only seven avenues for sideline production, but after the local supply and marketing cooperative supplied raw materials for sideline production and purchased products, the production avenues have increased to eighteen. The Tanbi Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Huixian County helped the local Tanbi Agricultural Cooperative formulate a plan for agricultural and sideline production. Without affecting agricultural production, it organized more than 500 people to go to the mountains to collect medicinal materials and carry brambles, etc., earning more than 1,100 yuan in sideline income in five days, and the members' pocket money gradually became more ample.

Next to the Yangtze River, the fishing team of the Daqiao Agricultural Production Cooperative is fishing.

    供销社帮助解决原料和销路问题
    河南省各地供销合作社积极帮助农业生产合作社发展副业生产。到五月上旬为止，许昌专区各地供销合作社已经把总值二十五万元以上的铁、荆条、苇子等生产原料供应到各个农业社加工生产。信阳、开封等专区的供销合作社都广泛地与当地农业社签订合同，帮助解决了副业产品的原料和销路的问题。仅西平县的供销合作社就与农业社签订了一千四百多份副业产品加工合同。
    各地供销合作社还加强了副业产品的收购工作。上蔡县胡店乡原来只有七种副业生产门路，当地供销合作社供应副业生产原料和收购产品后，生产门路已经增加到十八种。辉县薄壁供销合作社帮助当地薄壁农业社制定了农副业生产规划，在不影响农业生产的情况下，组织五百多人上山采药材、担荆条等，五天内就得到副业收入一千一百多元，社员手里的零用钱逐渐宽裕。（据新华社讯）
