    While international opinion is still discussing the far-reaching impact of the Anglo-Soviet talks on international tensions, we now welcome with satisfaction the positive results of the talks between the leaders of the Soviet and French governments. The outcome of the Soviet-French talks fully accords with Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin's assessment on the eve of the talks: that the talks would help promote mutual understanding and rapprochement between the two countries, as well as the further easing of international tensions.
    The Soviet Union and France are two major European powers, playing important roles in world political, economic, and cultural affairs. Good and normal relations between the Soviet Union and France are not only crucial for these two countries but also have a significant impact on the overall international situation. Historical experience has repeatedly proven that friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and France is an important factor in ensuring European security and peace. Historical experience also demonstrates that differences in social systems have not hindered the ties and cooperation between the Soviet Union and France. For a relatively long period after the war, the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and France were damaged due to the repeated provocations of enemies of international cooperation. This situation caused concern among all those who support the cause of peace and international cooperation, and only pleased those international reactionary forces attempting to turn Europe into a hotbed for new wars. However, the Soviet and French peoples have not forgotten their traditional friendship, nor have they ceased their efforts to restore friendly relations between the two countries. It is not without reason that French public opinion believes that the results of the French parliamentary elections on January 2 this year reflect the strong desire of the French people to improve Soviet-French relations. The current trend toward easing international tensions and the political changes taking place in France have provided sufficiently favorable conditions for improving Soviet-French relations. The deep friendship and desire for cooperation between the peoples of the Soviet Union and France have ensured the success of this Soviet-French meeting.
    The statement of the Soviet-French talks indicates that the leaders of the two governments have achieved valuable results on the issue of improving Soviet-French relations. The two sides not only unanimously affirmed the great significance of improving Soviet-French relations for the interests of the two peoples and strengthening international peace and security but also reached specific agreements on developing bilateral trade ties and cultural exchanges. This has laid the foundation for the Soviet Union and France to effectively develop their relations with each other based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and friendly cooperation. The outcome of the Soviet-French talks has opened a new stage in Soviet-French relations. This progress in Soviet-French relations will have a positive impact on promoting the easing of international tensions.
    The leaders of the Soviet and French governments also exchanged views on many important current international issues during the talks and reached consensus on some issues. This will undoubtedly be beneficial to resolving these issues in the future. The two governments expressed their willingness to continue to cooperate in order to resolve important outstanding issues, and expressed their conviction that international trust will be established, the Cold War will eventually be eliminated, and the arms race will end, so that people of all countries can be freed from the threat of new wars. This valuable desire of the leaders of the Soviet and French governments is a great relief and powerful encouragement to all people who desire peace. The principles of mutual respect for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, and non-interference in internal affairs of each other have once again been recognized in the Soviet-French talks. This cannot but be regarded as another step forward in consolidating the cause of world peace. The two governments expressed their support for efforts to ease the situation in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, which has a positive significance for promoting peace in these regions.
    People especially welcome the determination expressed by the two governments to promote disarmament agreements. They emphasized the importance of reducing nuclear weapons, and expressed their willingness to work to reach agreements in order to take urgent steps for all countries, especially the five major powers, to reduce their armed forces and armaments. These lofty goals of the Soviet Union and France will undoubtedly receive the full support of the people of all countries. The French government recognized the great significance of the Soviet Union's recent decision to unilaterally reduce its armed forces, and expressed its belief that the Soviet Union's actions are conducive to the progress of disarmament negotiations. This view of the French government severely struck the attempts of those who are currently unwilling to disarm, who are trying to downplay the significance of the Soviet Union's disarmament actions in order to conceal their attempts to obstruct disarmament, and at the same time is conducive to the convergence of opinions on disarmament issues among countries.
    The success of the Soviet-French talks is the result of the Soviet government's firm implementation of a peaceful foreign policy, and also due to the French government's desire to ease international tensions. The leaders of the French government have apparently accepted the view of the vast majority of the French people that only by pursuing an independent foreign policy that conforms to the national interests of France, and through international peace cooperation, is it possible to consolidate France's international prestige and strengthen France's position as a major power. The outcome of the Soviet-French talks convincingly proves that as long as France acts in accordance with its own national interests, it will be able to gain public sympathy, praise, and support, and will be able to make due contributions to easing international tensions and consolidating the cause of world peace.
    The outcome of the Soviet-French talks once again illustrates that direct contact and frank talks between government leaders of various countries, especially those of major powers who bear the primary responsibility for maintaining world peace, play a significant positive role in improving international relations and enhancing international trust. People fully support the desire expressed in the Soviet-French talks' statement: that this kind of contact will be developed among the leaders of various countries in the future.

    苏法关系的新发展
    当各国舆论还在议论着英苏会谈对国际紧张局势所产生的深远影响的时候，我们现在又怀着满意的心情来欢迎苏联和法国政府领导人进行会谈所得到的良好结果。苏法会谈的结果完全符合苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在会谈前夕的估计：这次会谈有助于两国之间的彼此谅解和互相接近以及国际紧张局势的进一步和缓。
    苏联和法国是欧洲的两个大国，它们在世界政治、经济和文化事务中都起着重要的作用。苏法两国关系的良好和正常，不仅对于这两个国家是十分重要的，而且对于整个国际局势也有重大的影响。历史经验已不止一次地证明，苏法两国的友好合作是保障欧洲安全和和平的重要因素。历史经验同时也证明，社会制度的不同并没有阻碍苏法两国之间的联系和合作。在战后一个比较长的时期中，由于国际合作的敌人的百般挑拨，苏法两国的友好关系曾经遭到了损害。这种情况引起了一切支持和平和国际合作事业的人们的担忧，仅仅使那些企图把欧洲变为新战争温床的国际反动势力感到高兴。但是，苏联人民和法国人民并没有忘记他们之间的传统友谊，也没有停止过为恢复两国的友好关系而进行努力。法国舆论认为法国今年一月二日议会选举的结果反映了法国人民要求改善苏法关系的强烈愿望，并不是没有根据的。目前国际局势的趋向和缓和法国国内发生的政治变化，已给改善苏法关系提供了充分有利的条件。苏法两国人民深厚的友谊和合作的愿望保证了这一次苏法会谈的成功。
    苏法会谈的声明表明，两国政府领导人对于改善苏法关系的问题已经得到有价值的结果。双方不仅一致肯定了改善苏法关系对于两国人民的利益和加强国际和平和安全的重大意义，而且就发展两国贸易联系和文化交流达成了具体的协议。这就为苏法两国根据平等互利和友好合作的原则有成效地发展相互之间的关系奠定了基础。苏法会谈的结果打开了苏法关系的一个新阶段。苏法关系的这种进展，会对于促进国际局势的和缓产生积极的影响。
    苏法两国政府领导人在会谈中还对当前许多重要的国际问题交换了意见，并且在一些问题上取得了一致的看法。这对今后解决这些问题毫无疑问是有好处的。两国政府表示为了解决悬而未决的重要问题将继续进行合作，并且表示确信国际信任将会建立起来，冷战终会消除，军备竞赛将会结束，从而各国人民就可以摆脱新战争的威胁。苏法两国政府领导人的这种可贵的愿望，对于一切愿意和平的人们，是一种很大的宽慰也是一种有力的鼓舞。互相尊重彼此的领土完整和主权，互不侵犯和互不干涉内政的和平共处的原则，在苏法会谈中再一次得到了承认。这不能不被认为是巩固世界和平事业的又一进展。两国政府对和缓中近东和东南亚局势的努力表示支持，这对于促进这些地区的和平有着肯定的意义。
    人们特别欢迎两国政府表示致力促成裁军协议的决心。它们强调裁减核子武器的重要性，同时表示愿意努力争取达成协议，以便采取紧急步骤使各国首先是五大国裁减武装部队和军备。苏法两国的这种崇高的目标无疑将得到各国人民的充分支持。法国政府承认苏联最近决定单方面裁减武装部队的重大意义，并且表示相信苏联的行动有利于裁军谈判的进展。法国政府的这种看法严重地打击了那些目前不愿意裁军的人们的企图，他们竭力想贬低苏联裁军行动的意义，来掩饰他们阻挠裁军的图谋，同时也有利于各国在裁军问题上的意见的接近。
    苏法会谈的成功，是苏联政府坚定地执行和平外交政策的结果，同时也是由于法国政府怀有和缓国际紧张局势的愿望。法国政府的领导人显然接受了绝大多数法国人民的这样一种看法：只有执行符合法国民族利益的独立的外交政策，并通过国际和平合作，才有可能巩固法国的国际威信，加强法国的大国地位。苏法会谈的结果令人信服地证明，法国只要按照自己的民族利益行事，就能够取得舆论的同情、赞扬和支持，就能够对和缓国际紧张局势和巩固世界和平事业作出应有的贡献。
    苏法会谈的结果再一次说明，各国的政府领导人，首先是对维护世界和平负有主要责任的大国的政府领导人的直接接触和开诚布公的会谈，对于改善国际关系和增强国际信任是起着很大的积极作用的。人们完全支持苏法会谈声明中所表示的愿望：这种接触今后将在各国的领导人之间发展起来。
