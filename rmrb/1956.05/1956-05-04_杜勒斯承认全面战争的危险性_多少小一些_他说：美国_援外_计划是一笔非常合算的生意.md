Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 2nd Dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on April 30th, requesting that the committee approve the U.S. government's "foreign aid" program for the 1957 fiscal year.

In his testimony, Dulles admitted that "the danger of all-out war now seems somewhat less," and he also acknowledged that the Soviet Union and China are working to develop international economic cooperation. However, Dulles refused to face the fact that U.S. foreign policy is increasingly failing in the current situation. Instead, he vigorously touted the "policy of strength" that is running into obstacles everywhere and advocated that "this policy should be continued."

Dulles discussed the situations in the Far East, the Middle East, and Western Europe in his testimony. He continued to advocate the U.S. policy of interfering in Korea and Vietnam and occupying China's Taiwan. Dulles said: "From the U.S. point of view, each of these positions is extremely important." In addition to providing these regions with "direct military assistance," the U.S. must also provide so-called "defense support."

Dulles also disregarded the desire for independence and neutrality of many countries in the Middle East and Western Europe, and advocated implementing the U.S.'s so-called "protective umbrella" policy in the Middle East and Western Europe. He said that the U.S. must support the Baghdad Pact, maintain the "military strength" of the North Atlantic Group countries, and must "station a large portion of U.S. troops in Western Europe to defend it."

In his testimony, Dulles emphasized that the entire U.S. "foreign aid" program is a very cost-effective business. He said that the cost of this program only accounts for about 10% of the total U.S. annual military expenditure. With this program, the U.S. does not need to send its own troops, but can maintain U.S. "important strongholds" around the world by paying "less than any other method that can be conceived," while also providing the U.S. with "bases all over the world."

　　杜勒斯承认全面战争的危险性“多少小一些”
    他说：美国“援外”计划是一笔非常合算的生意
    新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯四月三十日在参议院外交委员会作证，他要求外交委员会通过美国政府1957财政年度的“援外”计划。
    杜勒斯在证词里承认“全面战争的危险性现在看来多少小一些”，他并且承认苏联和中国正在致力于发展国际经济合作。但是，杜勒斯不肯面对美国外交政策在当前局势中日益遭到失败的事实，他反而竭力吹嘘到处碰壁的“实力政策”，并且主张“应该继续执行这种政策”。
    杜勒斯在证词里谈到了远东、中东以及西欧的局势。他继续鼓吹美国干涉朝鲜、越南和霸占中国的台湾的政策。杜勒斯说：“从美国的观点看来，这些阵地每一个都是极其重要的。”美国除了要给予这些地区以“直接的军事援助”外，还要给予所谓“防御支持”。
    杜勒斯还不顾中东和西欧许多国家要求独立和中立的愿望，鼓吹在中东和西欧执行美国的所谓“保护伞”政策。他说，美国必须支持巴格达条约、维持北大西洋集团国家的“军事力量”，并且必须“把一大部分美国军队驻在西欧来保卫它”。
    杜勒斯在证词里强调说明：美国的整个“援外”计划是一笔非常合算的生意。他说，这个计划的费用只占美国每年军费总额的10％左右。靠了这个计划，美国毋需派遣自己的部队，而只要付出比“可能想出的其他任何办法都更少的代价”，就可以保持美国在世界各地的“重要据点”，同时还可以为美国“在全球各地提供基地”。
