Do a Good Job in Summer Planting, Summer Harvesting, and Summer Harvest Pre-Distribution
Gansu and Jiangsu Provinces Determine the Central Tasks of Current Rural Work

    The Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting of prefectural party committee secretaries from May 10th to 14th. The meeting pointed out that the current central tasks in rural areas are: to strengthen field management of summer and autumn crops, prevent disasters and protect seedlings, prevent pests and diseases, do a good job in sowing autumn crops, which account for 60% of the province's total crop harvest, do a good job in the summer pre-distribution of agricultural cooperatives, and develop diversified operations in agricultural and sideline production.
    Since the beginning of spring, sideline production in the province has significantly decreased compared to the same period last year, and the meeting believes this is an abnormal phenomenon. The sideline production of agricultural cooperatives should be carried out by discussing and defining the scope and types of operations among the members to develop diversified operations and increase the income of the members. To this end, it was decided that each male laborer should have sixty to one hundred days of time to be managed by the farmers themselves. It is appropriate for each female laborer to participate in field labor for one hundred and thirty days a year to take care of women's household labor and other difficulties.
    In order to implement the principle of "running cooperatives diligently and frugally," the meeting decided to reduce non-productive expenditures and agricultural capital construction investments of agricultural cooperatives. The meeting also discussed improving and enhancing leadership methods and strengthening the management of agricultural cooperatives.

    The enlarged meeting held by the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China in early May believed that in the next month or so, rural work should focus on summer planting, summer harvesting, and summer harvest pre-distribution, and also do a good job in summer grain procurement and other tasks.
    This year's summer planting area in Jiangsu accounts for 41% of the province's sown area and 65% of the province's total grain output. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure timely planting, and areas with the conditions should plant as much autumn soybeans as possible and strive for a large-scale bumper harvest of oil crops; at the same time, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to use all available space in front of and behind their houses to plant scattered cash crops.
    In addition to timely harvesting of summer crops, it is also necessary to select and reserve enough wheat and green manure seeds, and to conscientiously summarize the experience of large-scale wheat bumper harvests to ensure that this year's autumn planting is better than in previous years.
    The summer harvest pre-distribution should meet the requirements of the broad masses of members to increase production and income, and ensure that poor peasants, middle peasants, prosperous middle peasants, and the widowed and lonely are all happy.

    做好夏种夏收和夏收预分工作
    甘肃江苏两省确定当前农村工作的中心任务
    中共甘肃省委在五月十日到十四日召开了地委书记会议。会议指出农村当前的中心任务是：加强夏秋作物的田间管理，防灾保苗，防止病虫害，作好占全省农作物总收成60％的秋季作物的播种工作，作好农业合作社的夏季预分工作和发展农副业生产的多种经营。
    入春以来，全省副业生产较去年同一时期显著减少，会议认为这是不正常的现象。应该通过社员的讨论，划分经营范围和种类来开展农业合作社的副业生产，发展多种经营，以增加社员的收入。为此决定每个男劳动力全年应有六十到一百天的时间由农民自己支配。每个女劳动力全年参加田间劳动应以一百三十天为宜，以照顾妇女家务劳动等困难。
    为贯彻执行“勤俭办社”的方针，会议决定减少农业合作社非生产性的开支和农业基本建设的投资。会议还讨论了改进和提高领导方法，加强农业合作社管理工作等问题。

    中共江苏省委在五月上旬举行的扩大会议认为今后一个多月内，农村工作应该以夏种、夏收和夏收预分为中心，并且做好夏粮征购和其他工作。
    江苏今年夏种面积占全省播种面积41％，产量占全省粮食总产量65％，因此必须保证及时种植，有条件的地方要尽可能多种一些秋大豆，争取油料作物大面积丰产；同时要动员群众利用家前屋后一切空地，种植零星经济作物。
    夏收除做到适时收割外，还要把麦子和绿肥的种子选好、留足，并且要认真总结麦子大面积丰产的经验，保证今年的秋种比往年更好。
    夏收预分要满足广大社员增加生产和增加收入的要求，做到贫农、中农、富裕中农以及鳏寡孤独皆大欢喜。　　　　（本报驻南京记者）
