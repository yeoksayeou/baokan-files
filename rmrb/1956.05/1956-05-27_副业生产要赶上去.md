Sideline Production Needs to Catch Up
    Liu Xi
    After the realization of agricultural cooperativization in Guizhou Province, the production enthusiasm of farmers has generally increased, and great achievements have been made in agricultural production. Taking this year's spring plowing preparation as an example, it is generally better than any previous year. The construction of farmland water conservancy, wasteland reclamation, and afforestation have all been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the targets. The fertilizer accumulated by farmers has increased by one-half to more than double compared with the same period last year. All localities have attached importance to agricultural technology reform work. According to incomplete statistics, more than 88,000 agricultural technicians have been trained in the province. Many areas have planted large amounts of double-cropping rice and double-cropping corn. These achievements have laid the foundation for completing the annual production increase plan. However, sideline production in rural areas is not very adapted to this situation. Many agricultural cooperatives have reduced the types of sideline production they operate; some have even squeezed out sideline production altogether. The province's hog production has decreased by 20% to 30% compared with last year; in individual places, it has decreased by 70% to 80%. Farm tool processing, oil extraction, transportation, and some of the farmers' scattered household sideline occupations have all been curtailed to varying degrees.
    Why did this phenomenon occur? The most important reason is that some rural workers were not calm enough in the face of the high tide of agricultural production, failed to put themselves in the shoes of the farmers in terms of production and life, and comprehensively consider the problems. They believed that as long as agricultural production was done well, it did not matter whether sideline production was done well or poorly. In some places, when calculating labor remuneration, the remuneration for agricultural production was calculated too high, which misled the members into thinking that "engaging in sideline production is not worthwhile." In some places, in order to emphasize the attendance rate of agricultural production, the slogan "Everyone goes to work, every household closes its doors" was inappropriately put forward. The issues of time arrangement and labor organization for sideline production (including both collectively operated by the cooperative and operated by the household members) were not resolved. The Yuanfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Machang District, Kaiyang County, abandoned its leadership over sideline production, and the cooperative's original five sideline occupations and most of the household members' sideline occupations were suspended. Income decreased by more than 2,000 yuan in three months. Many members did not even have money to buy oil or salt, and often had to borrow money from the cooperative. Facts have proved that sideline production occupies an important position in the rural economy. Many sideline productions are not only related to the development of agricultural production and the needs of the people's lives, but also some sideline products are indispensable materials for national construction and foreign trade. It is understood that sideline production accounts for 30% to 40% of the income of farmers in Guizhou Province in a year; in some places, it reaches more than 50%. According to the materials investigated by the Provincial Bureau of Statistics: In 1954, the average cash income of each farmer in the province was 122 yuan, accounting for 26.63% of the total income. Most of these cash incomes were obtained through sideline production. According to this situation, relaxing or abandoning the leadership of sideline production, even if the agricultural production increase plan is completed, it will be difficult to guarantee an increase in the income of the members. This will cause undue losses to both the farmers and the state.
    Rural sideline production is diverse. There are more than 100 kinds of sideline production in Guizhou, and a farmer can engage in dozens of kinds of sideline production. At present, when agricultural cooperatives still lack experience in carrying out diversified operations, have poor labor organization, and the masses of farmers are not very accustomed to collective production, concentrating all these many sideline production projects to the cooperative for operation will inevitably be beyond their reach and dilute the leadership of the cooperative. However, some rural workers do not listen to the opinions of the masses, dare not face up to the actual situation in rural areas, and blindly pursue formalism, emphasizing unified management and uniformity, and regard the legitimate household sideline occupations of the members as "wanting to get rich personally" and "taking the capitalist road"; some places even use crude methods such as "deducting work points" and "struggling" to treat members engaged in household sideline production. As a result of this approach, the enthusiasm of the members to engage in household sideline production has been dampened, and the cooperative cannot "take over" all sideline production. In Pinglong Township, Zunyi County, there were originally more than 50 households engaged in bamboo weaving, but now the local supply and marketing cooperative cannot find anyone to process bamboo farm tools. In some places, the remuneration for sideline occupations collectively operated by agricultural cooperatives is not calculated according to technical conditions and the difficulty of the work, and the depreciation of sideline production tools is too low. After the two water mills of the Guping Society of Zhuping Township, Guiding County, joined the society, the society did not depreciate them, but only issued 3 yuan per person for repair costs (in 1955). The staff who helped work in this society, however, believed that "the meat rots in the pot" and ignored it. These practices have hindered the development of rural sideline production.
    In addition, when some business departments assign tasks to the lower levels, they do not distinguish between priorities and urgency, regardless of whether they are needed at the moment, and whether they affect the most urgent production tasks? They build too many and too early some basic constructions that can be postponed or not done. This makes the staff in the cooperatives feel that there are many tasks and insufficient labor to allocate, and they can't take care of this end and can't take care of that end, which is also one of the reasons for the reduction and weakening of sideline production.
    The reduction of rural sideline production has seriously affected agricultural production and the people's lives, and can no longer be taken lightly. Recently, the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee convened a rural work conference, requiring leading organs at all levels to effectively strengthen their leadership over sideline production and correct all erroneous ideas that ignore sideline production. The meeting held that, without affecting agricultural production, a comprehensive plan and arrangement should be made for sideline production. Leadership organizations for sideline production should be established in agricultural cooperatives, and help should be provided to solve the problems of time and raw materials for members to engage in household sideline production. In order to prevent the blind development of sideline production and pay attention to the balance between production and sales, agricultural cooperatives in various places should sign contracts with supply and marketing, procurement, transportation, and handicraft management departments to incorporate sideline production into the national plan.

    副业生产要赶上去
    刘希
    贵州省实现农业合作化以后，农民的生产情绪普遍高涨，在农业生产上取得了很大成绩，就今年的春耕准备工作来讲，一般比以往任何一年做得都好。兴修农田水利、开垦荒地、植树造林都提前超额完成了任务。农民所积的肥料，比去年同时期增加了二分之一到一倍以上。各地都重视了农业技术改革工作。据不完全的统计，全省训练了农业技术人员八万八千多人。很多地区大量地种植了双季稻、双季玉米。这些成就为完成全年的增产计划打下了基础。但是农村中的副业生产同这种情况还很不适应。很多农业合作社经营的副业生产的种类减少了；有的甚至把副业挤掉了。全省的毛猪生产比去年减少了20％到30％；个别的地方减少70％到80％。农具加工、榨油、运输以及农民一些零星的家庭副业，都有不同程度的削减。
    为什么发生了这种现象呢？最主要的原因，是有些农村工作人员在农业生产高潮的面前，不够冷静，没能设身处地为农民的生产和生活着想，全面地考虑问题，认为只要搞好农业生产就行了，副业生产搞好搞坏没关系。有的地方在计算劳动报酬的时候，把农业生产的报酬计算得太高，使社员产生了错觉，认为“经营副业划不来”；有的地方为了强调农业生产的出勤率，不适当地提出“人人出工，户户关门”的口号。对副业生产（包括合作社集体经营的和社员家庭经营的）的时间安排、劳力组织等问题，不给解决。开阳县马场区原丰农业合作社放弃了对副业生产的领导，社里原有的五种副业和社员的大部分家庭副业都停顿了。三个月减少收入两千多元。很多社员连打油、买盐零花的钱都没有，经常要向社里借钱。事实证明：副业生产在农村经济中占有重要的地位，许多副业生产不仅关系到农业生产的发展和人民生活的需要，而且有些副业产品是国家建设和对外贸易必不可缺少的物资。据了解，贵州省农民一年的收入，副业生产占30％到40％；有的地方达到50％以上。省统计局调查的材料：1954年全省平均每一户农民的现金收入为一百二十二元，占总收入的26.63％。这些现金收入绝大部分是靠经营副业生产得来的。按照这种情况计算，放松或放弃副业生产的领导，即便完成了农业增产计划，也很难保证社员增加收入。这对农民对国家都将招致不应有的损失。
    农村的副业生产是多种多样的。贵州的副业生产有一百多种，一个农民经营的副业生产就可以有几十种。在目前农业合作社还缺乏进行多种经营的经验，劳力组织不善，农民群众还不十分习惯集体生产的情况下，要把这许多副业生产项目都集中到合作社来经营，必然会鞭长莫及，分散了合作社的领导力量。可是有些农村工作人员不倾听群众的意见，不敢正视农村的实际情况，一味追求形式主义，强调统一经营、整齐划一，把社员正当的家庭副业，说成是“想个人发财”、“走资本主义道路”；有的地方甚至用“扣工分”、“斗争”等粗暴的方法对待从事家庭副业生产的社员。这样做法的结果，打击了社员经营家庭副业生产的积极性，合作社又不能把全部的副业生产都“包下来”。遵义县坪龙乡原有五十多户编竹器的，现在当地的供销社已经找不到人加工竹子农具了。有些地方的农业合作社集体经营的副业，计算报酬不按照技术条件和活路难易，副业生产工具折价偏低。贵定县竹坪乡古平社社员的两座水碾入社后，社里没有折价，只发给了每人三元钱的修补费（1955年的）。在这个社里帮助工作的工作人员，则认为“肉烂在锅里”，置之不理。这些做法都阻碍了农村副业生产的发展。
    此外，有些业务部门向下面布置工作的时候，不分轻重缓急，不管当前是否需要，是否影响最紧迫的生产任务？过多过早地兴建一些可以不办或者可以缓办的基本建设。使合作社里的工作人员感到任务多，劳力不够分配，顾了这头，顾不了那头，也是造成副业生产减少和削弱的一个原因。
    农村副业生产的削减，已经严重地影响到农业生产和人民的生活，再也不能等闲视之了。最近，贵州省委召开了农村工作会议，要求各级领导机关切实地加强对副业生产的领导，纠正一切忽视副业生产的错误思想。会议认为，在不影响农业生产的原则下，对副业生产要进行全面的规划和安排。农业合作社里要建立副业生产的领导机构，对社员经营家庭副业的时间、原料等问题要帮助解决。为了防止盲目地发展副业生产，注意产销平衡，各地农业合作社应当同供销、采购、交通运输、手工业管理部门订立合同，把副业生产纳入国家计划。
