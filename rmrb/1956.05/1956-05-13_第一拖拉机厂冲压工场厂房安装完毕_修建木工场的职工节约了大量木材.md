The comprehensive installation project of the structural components for the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant's stamping workshop building was completed ahead of schedule on May 7th. The speed of this project was more than 30% faster than the previous average.

Now, the stamping workshop stands among the capped, ochre-red factory buildings, which are auxiliary workshops scheduled to go into production in the fourth quarter of this year, as well as the completed or soon-to-be-completed forging workshop, repair and casting workshop, main warehouse, and other major factory buildings.

Workers building the carpentry workshop of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant have achieved great success in saving timber. In the on-site pouring of concrete pillars, roof trusses, and slab beams, they created a continuous flow, three-section rapid demolding method, which accelerated the turnover rate of formwork. At the same time, in the process of making formwork, they made every effort to utilize existing old formwork and waste wood. These two measures saved the state more than 1,500 cubic meters of timber, worth more than 179,000 yuan.

    第一拖拉机厂冲压工场厂房安装完毕
    修建木工场的职工节约了大量木材
    第一拖拉机制造厂冲压工场厂房构件的综合安装工程已经提前在五月七日完成。这项工程的速度比以往平均加快了30％以上。
    现在，冲压工场已经矗立在结了顶的赭红色的厂房群中，它们是今年第四季度就要投入生产的辅助工场和完成了或即将完成的锻工场、修铸工场、总库房等主要厂房。
    修建第一拖拉机制造厂木工场的职工们，在节约木材方面取得了很大的成绩。他们在现场捣制混凝土柱子、屋架、板梁等构件的工程中，创造了流水连续施工三节快速脱模法，加速了模板周转率；同时，在制模板过程中，尽可能地利用了库存旧模板和废木料。这两项措施共为国家节省了一千五百多立方木材，价值十七万九千多元。
