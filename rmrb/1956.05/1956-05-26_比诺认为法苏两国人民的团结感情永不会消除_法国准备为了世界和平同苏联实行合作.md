    Xinhua News Agency, May 25th dispatch: According to TASS, Moscow: French Foreign Minister Bidault, who is currently visiting the Soviet Union, said on the 24th: "Mr. Mollet and I myself were very happy and confidently accepted the sincere invitation of the Soviet government. Our visit and the results obtained have exceeded our hopes. We have consolidated the traditional friendly ties between the Soviet and French people."
    Bidault made these remarks when he delivered a radio speech on Moscow Radio. He described the impressions he gained during his visits to various parts of the Soviet Union.
    Bidault said: In history, our two peoples have undergone many common trials and heavy sacrifices, which have united the two peoples together, and this feeling of solidarity will never be eliminated. Every French person, regardless of his political beliefs, recalls with gratitude the heroic and bloody struggle you waged for the liberation of all peoples.
    Bidault said that during the visit, I immediately understood that the Soviet people also preserved their feelings of love for our country, and I was very proud to feel the respect shown by the Soviet people everywhere for the French Resistance. Whether in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Rostov, or Yerevan, the government and residents of every place received us with warmth and hospitality and expressed their friendship to us. This obvious and sincere feeling deeply moved us. I thank the Soviet people for making it possible for us to re-establish this relationship.
    When talking about the situation of the Franco-Soviet talks, Bidault said: There has rarely been a more frank and sincere exchange of views than between us. We do not want to hide the true situation and cover up the differences that may exist between us. We prefer sincere explanations, so that the other party can better understand their own views and ultimately bring us closer.
    The most significant point is that we have successfully determined many common courses of action. Whenever we talk about world peace and improving people's lives, we trust each other and are ready to cooperate in order to achieve these two important goals.

    比诺认为法苏两国人民的团结感情永不会消除
    法国准备为了世界和平同苏联实行合作
    据新华社25日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：正在苏联访问的法国外交部长比诺在二十四日说：“摩勒先生和我自己都很高兴和信任地接受了苏联政府的热诚邀请。我们的访问和所获得的结果都超过了我们的希望。我们巩固了苏法两国人民的传统的友谊联系。”
    比诺这番话是他在莫斯科电台发表广播演说的时候说的。他叙述了他在苏联各地访问所获得的印象。
    比诺说：在历史上我们两国人民经受过很多共同的考验和沉重的牺牲，这些考验和牺牲把两国人民团结在一起，这种团结的感情是永远不会消除的。每一个法国人，不管他的政治信念怎样，无不怀着感激的心情来回忆你们为了各国人民的解放所进行的英勇的流血斗争。
    比诺说，在访问期间，我立刻懂得了，苏联人民也保存着爱戴我国的感情，我很骄傲地体会到苏联人民处处对法国抵抗运动所表示的尊敬。无论在莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、罗斯托夫、埃里温，每一个地方的政府和居民都亲切好客地接待了我们，对我们表示了友谊，这种明显的真挚的感情使我们深深感动。我感谢苏联人民使我们之间有可能重新建立了这种关系。
    在谈到法苏会谈的情况的时候，比诺说：很少有比我们之间的交换意见更坦率和更诚恳的了。我们并不想隐瞒真实的情况和掩盖我们之间可能存在的分歧。我们喜欢诚恳的解释，这样才能使对方更好地了解自己的观点，终究使我们接近起来。
    最有意义的一点是，我们成功地确定了许多共同行动的路线。每当我们之间谈起世界和平和改善人民生活的时候，我们就彼此信任地准备实行合作，以便达到这两个重要目的。
