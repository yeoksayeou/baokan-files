Xinhua News Agency, London, May 14th: According to TASS, London, May 14th: Some British politicians admit that international developments show that the policy of piecing together military blocs is fruitless and has no future.

    Conservative MP Robert Boothby, in an article published in the "World News" on the 14th, emphasized that NATO "cannot adapt to the fundamentally changed situation." Boothby expressed doubt as to whether the Western countries' policy of using economic aid as the price for concluding military alliances in the Far East and the Middle East would be effective. He said: "For example, the existence of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization led to the convening of the Bandung Conference and caused us to lose Ceylon." Boothby suggested that, within the various groups established by Western countries, the focus should be shifted from military issues to economic issues.

    Boothby gave a positive evaluation of Churchill's speech in Aachen and called for the formulation of a policy that could consolidate "the possibility of effective cooperation unfolding before mankind."

    Labour MP Richard Crossman also commented on Churchill's speech at a gathering of Labour Party members in Caernarfon, Wales, on the 13th. Crossman believed that Churchill "realized" the fundamental changes in the international situation and understood that "Western policy should be completely revised to adapt to the new situation." Crossman acknowledged that eliminating the phenomenon of Europe being divided into mutually opposed groups of countries is of great positive significance for resolving the most important international issues.

    英国政界人士承认军事集团政策没有前途
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社伦敦十四日讯：英国一些政界人士承认，国际事态的发展表明拼凑军事集团的政策是没有结果，也没有前途的。
    保守党议员罗伯特·布斯比十四日在“世界新闻报”上发表文章，强调指出北大西洋公约组织“不能够适应已经起了根本变化的局势”。布斯比对西方国家打算用经济援助作为代价来缔结军事联盟的政策在远东和中东是否收到效果这一点表示怀疑，他说：“例如，东南亚条约组织的存在导致了万隆会议的召开，并且使我们失去了锡兰。”布斯比建议，在西方国家建立的各种集团中，应当把重点从军事问题转移到经济问题上。
    布斯比对丘吉尔在亚琛发表的演说给予肯定的评价，并且呼吁制定一种能够巩固“在人类面前展开的有效合作的可能性”的政策。
    工党议员理查德·克罗斯曼十三日在威尔士的卡那封工党党员集会上也评论了丘吉尔的演说，克罗斯曼认为，丘吉尔“意识到”国际局势的根本变化，并且了解到“西方政策应当完全改订以适应新的局势”。克罗斯曼承认消除把欧洲分裂为互相对立的国家集团的现象，对解决最重要的国际问题具有巨大的积极意义。
