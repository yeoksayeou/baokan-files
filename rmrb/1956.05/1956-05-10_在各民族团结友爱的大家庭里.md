　　Absorbing Outstanding Members of All Nationalities into the Party
　　The Chinese Communist Party Northwest Nationalities Institute Committee has admitted sixty-five people from ten nationalities, including Mongol, Tibetan, Uyghur, Hui, Kazakh, Yugur, Dongxiang, Salar, Tu, and Han, into the Communist Party.
　　At 2:00 PM on April 27th, a swearing-in ceremony for new party members was held in the auditorium of the Northwest Nationalities Institute. Zhang Yangwu, Secretary of the CCP Northwest Nationalities Institute Committee, spoke, saying that the admission of these comrades into the Party not only strengthened the Party ranks at the Northwest Nationalities Institute but also added a new force to the various minority nationalities. Yi Dan Cairang (Tibetan), representing the new Party members, spoke, expressing that under the Party's cultivation and education in the future, he would actively study, work hard, and dedicate everything he has to the cause of the Party.
　　More Than 700 Tibetan Workers Appear in Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture
　　More than 700 Tibetan workers have emerged in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan Province. These Tibetan workers include construction, portering, and other handicraft workers, as well as many industrial workers distributed in local power plants, printing factories, mica mines, iron mines, wool washing factories, and transportation departments. Before liberation, there were only a few handicraft workers in Kangding County in Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and not a single Tibetan industrial worker in the entire prefecture.
　　The skills of these Tibetan workers are steadily improving, and many labor models have emerged among them. Mo Luo and Weng Qing, who attended the National Conference of Advanced Producers Representatives, are outstanding workers from the Danba Mica Mine and Kangding Wool Washing Factory. In the third shift of the Danba Mica Mine, which consists of more than 100 Tibetan workers, 50% of the workers have joined the Communist Party or the Communist Youth League.
　　Scientific Research Activities of Minority Students
　　Students of all nationalities at Xinjiang College have thrown themselves into the upsurge of marching toward science. Currently, 150 students from various minority nationalities in the Agriculture and Forestry, Animal Husbandry, History and Geography, Education, Language, Biochemistry, and Mathematics and Physics Departments have formed sixteen extracurricular scientific research groups, studying radio, meteorology, dendrology, biology, language, ethnic literature, the history of the Chinese revolution, etc.
　　Not long ago, ten students from the Radio Group of the Mathematics and Physics Department successfully made a crystal radio, and are now making vacuum tube radios. The Biology Group has also opened up a three-mu experimental garden for their research work.

　　在各民族团结友爱的大家庭里
    吸收各民族优秀分子入党
    中国共产党西北民族学院委员会接收了蒙古、藏、维吾尔、回、哈萨克、裕固、东乡、撒拉、土族、汉等十个民族的六十五人参加共产党。
    四月二十七日下午二时，在西北民族学院礼堂举行了新党员宣誓大会。中共西北民族学院委员会书记张养吾讲话，他说：吸收这批同志入党不仅壮大了西北民族学院党的队伍，同时给各少数民族增加了一批新的力量。新党员代表义丹才让（藏）讲话，他表示今后要在党的培养教育下，积极学习，努力工作，把自己的一切献给党的事业。
    甘孜藏族自治州出现七百多名藏族工人
    四川省甘孜藏族自治州已经出现了七百多名藏族工人。这些藏族工人中有建筑、搬运等手工业工人，还有不少是分布在各地电厂、印刷厂、云母矿、铁矿、洗毛厂及交通运输部门的产业工人。解放前，甘孜藏族自治州只有康定县有少数的手工业工人，全州连一个藏族产业工人也没有。
    这些藏族工人的技术正在日益提高，他们当中还出现了不少劳动模范，出席全国先进生产者代表会议的莫洛和翁青，就是丹巴云母矿和康定洗毛厂的优秀工人。在由一百多个藏族工人组成的丹巴云母矿第三场中，已有50％的工人加入了共产党或青年团。少数民族学生的科学研究活动
    新疆学院各民族的学生投入了向科学进军的热潮。现在，农林、畜牧、史地、教育、语文、生化、数理等系的150名各少数民族的学生，已组成了十六个课外科学研究小组，分别研究无线电、气象、树木学、生物、语文、民族文学、中国革命史等。
    不久前，数理系无线电小组的十个学生自制矿石收音机成功了，现在正制作真空管的收音机。生物学小组也为自己的研究工作开辟了一个三亩地的实验园地。
