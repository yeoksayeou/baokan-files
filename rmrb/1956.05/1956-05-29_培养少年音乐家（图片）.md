    Cultivating Young Musicians
    In order to cultivate young children with musical talent, the Central Conservatory of Music has established a junior class. In addition to studying basic music courses, each student also chooses a musical instrument as their major. Ren Cailian (playing the instrument), a first-year student in the junior class, is very fond of national musical instruments, and she has already learned to play several of them. This is a scene of her giving a solo performance of the erhu for her classmates.

    培养少年音乐家
    为了培养有音乐才能的少年儿童，中央音乐学院附设了一个少年班。学生们除了学习音乐基础课程以外，每人还选修一门乐器专修课。少年班一年级学生任彩莲（拉琴的）对民族乐器很喜爱，她已经学会了几种民族乐器的弹奏。这是她正在给同学们独奏二胡的情形。
