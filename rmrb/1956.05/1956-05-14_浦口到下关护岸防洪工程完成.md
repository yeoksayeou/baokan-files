Pukou to Xiaguan Embankment Flood Control Project Completed

The Pukou-Xiaguan Yangtze River embankment flood control project, a hub for north-south transportation, has recently been completed.

The completion of this project can eliminate the serious threat of riverbank collapse that has historically been insurmountable, stabilize the riverbed, withstand the impact of major floods, and protect the lives and property of a million people in Nanjing and the safety of north-south transportation.

Now, a solid embankment, one hundred meters wide, has been built from the water to the bottom of the river along the nearly six-kilometer-long riverbank from Pukou to Xiaguan. The top of the embankment is as high as 11.52 meters, which is 1.3 meters higher than the 1954 flood level, which was unprecedented in a century.

    浦口到下关护岸防洪工程完成
    南北交通的枢纽浦口—下关的长江护岸防洪工程最近竣工。
    这一工程的完成，可以消除历史上无法克服的坍江的严重威胁，使江床稳定，能够抵御特大洪水的袭击，保护南京百万人民生命财产和南北交通的安全。
    现在，浦口下关近六公里长的江岸上，从水上到江底筑起了一道一百多公尺宽的坚固的堤防。堤顶高达十一点五二公尺，比百年未有的1954年洪水位还高出一公尺三。
