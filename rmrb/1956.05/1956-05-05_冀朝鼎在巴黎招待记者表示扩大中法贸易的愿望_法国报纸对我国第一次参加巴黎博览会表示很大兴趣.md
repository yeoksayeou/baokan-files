Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 4th -- Paris dispatch: The Chinese Exhibition Hall at the Paris Exposition has been completely constructed and arranged, and is ready to open on May 5th.

　　On the evening of May 3rd, Ji Chao Ding, head of the Chinese Council for the Promotion of International Trade's exhibition delegation to the Paris Exposition, held a grand press conference in the Chinese Exhibition Hall, which featured red walls, green tiles, and a magnificent, gilded appearance. Approximately 300 people, including heads and reporters from various newspapers and magazines, attended the reception.

　　Ji Chao Ding delivered a speech saying that the Chinese pavilion exhibited a total of approximately 1,400 commodities, reflecting the new achievements of China's economic construction and the great potential strength of China's foreign trade.

　　Ji Chao Ding pointed out that with the development of economic construction and the improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards, China is increasingly increasing its imports of various industrial equipment, raw materials, and certain consumer goods. At the same time, the variety and quantity of various traditional and new export goods will also continue to expand. He said that if artificial obstacles are eliminated, France and other Western countries have a solid material foundation and broad prospects for carrying out normal trade with China on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

　　Ji Chao Ding expressed his belief that this exhibition would help to further enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese and French people, and help develop economic and trade relations between the two countries.

　　Various French newspapers of different persuasions have shown great interest in the new China's first participation in the Paris Exposition. Reporters from "Le Figaro" and "L'Aurore" visited the Chinese exhibition delegation and published interviews. Newspapers such as "Le Monde" and "L'Humanité" published news about the Chinese exhibition delegation or pictures of the Chinese Exhibition Hall. "Le Figaro" wrote: "One of the most attractive places in the exposition that will open on May 5 will undoubtedly be the Chinese Pavilion."

    冀朝鼎发表讲话说，这次中国馆一共展出约一千四百多种商品，这些展品体现了中国经济建设的新成就和中国对外贸易的巨大潜在力量。
    冀朝鼎指出，随着经济建设发展和人民物质文化生活水平的提高，中国在日益增加着各种工业设备、原料和若干消费品的进口。同时，各种传统的和新的出口物资的品种和数量也将不断扩大。他说，如果消除了人为的障碍，法国和其他西方国家同中国在平等互利的基础上开展正常贸易是有可靠的物质基础和广阔前途的。
    冀朝鼎表示相信这次展出将有助于进一步增进中法两国人民之间的相互了解和友谊，有助于发展两国间的经济贸易关系。
    法国各种不同倾向的报纸对于新中国第一次参加巴黎博览会表现出很大的兴趣。“费加罗报”和“震旦报”的记者访问了中国展览团，并且发表了访问记。“世界报”和“人道报”等报纸刊载了关于中国展览团的消息或者中国展览馆的图片。“费加罗报”写道：“在将于五月五日开幕的博览会中，最有吸引力的地方之一无疑是中国馆”。
