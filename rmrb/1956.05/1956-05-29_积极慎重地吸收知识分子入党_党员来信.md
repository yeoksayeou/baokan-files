Actively and Prudently Recruit Intellectuals into the Party
--Letter from a Party Member--

Editor's Note: Before any Party organization accepts a new member, it must conduct long-term education and observation of the candidate. Only after the candidate truly meets the requirements for Party membership can the process of acceptance begin, following the procedures stipulated in the Party Constitution. Holding a swearing-in ceremony for new Party members is not a mandatory step in the process. However, after the admission procedures have been completed, holding a swearing-in ceremony to educate non-Party activists is permissible. However, hastily admitting members simply to pursue the form of a swearing-in ceremony, as was done by the Hengyang Municipal Party Committee's Organization Department, is unacceptable. It is even more erroneous for some localities to regard holding a swearing-in ceremony as a way to break open the work of developing Party members among intellectuals.

It should be recognized that developing Party members among intellectuals, like developing Party members in other sectors, should be the result of long-term and effective education and careful observation work conducted by the Party organization among non-Party activists. It must not be done hastily. Only in this way can we guarantee the quality of the Party members we admit.

Comrade Editor:

On March 11th of this year, the Organization Department of the Hengyang Municipal Party Committee called our factory (Hengyang Mining Machinery Factory) Party Committee, saying that the city would soon be admitting a batch of intellectuals into the Party, including two engineers from your factory. The factory Party Committee felt that this was too rushed. However, the next day, we received a written notice from the Municipal Party Committee's Organization Department: "A swearing-in ceremony for intellectuals joining the Party will be held on the 14th." That afternoon, cadres from the Municipal Party Committee's Organization Department came to our factory to urge us to complete the admission procedures for these two engineers, ensuring that they would attend the swearing-in ceremony on the 14th. At the time, the Party Secretary explained to the comrades from the Municipal Party Committee's Organization Department that one of these individuals had not yet applied to join the Party, and the branch had not yet studied the issue of their admission; therefore, he requested a delay of a few days. The comrades from the Municipal Party Committee's Organization Department replied that a delay was not possible, and added: These two individuals from your factory are key figures in this swearing-in ceremony (meaning that they are high-level intellectuals)! Thus, the Party Secretary had to first speak with the engineer who had not yet submitted an application, encouraging him to apply and asking him to immediately write an autobiography for the Party Committee. On the afternoon of the 13th, the branch held a meeting of Party members to discuss the admission of this engineer. At the meeting, everyone felt it was strange. The branch's Organizational Committee member explained to everyone that "the Municipal Party Committee wants to hold a swearing-in ceremony for new Party members and wants to admit this engineer into the Party." Only then did it barely pass. Another branch also hastily discussed and passed the decision to admit another engineer. After the branch meetings approved the admission of these two individuals, the Municipal Party Committee's Organization Department urged the Party Committee Secretary to sign and approve it before the Party Committee had even discussed it. The Party Committee Secretary said that he had not yet been through the Party Committee discussion and could not sign and approve it. The comrades from the Municipal Party Committee's Organization Department said: Sign and approve it! The Municipal Party Committee will take responsibility. Thus, the Party Committee Secretary had no choice but to sign, but he declared: I haven't even had time to read their autobiographies, and I cannot be responsible for their admission into the Party. On the afternoon of the 14th, these two engineers participated in the swearing-in ceremony for new Party members held by the Municipal Party Committee, swearing an oath to join the Party.

The Party Central Committee has repeatedly instructed us to adhere to the principle of active and prudent development of Party members, to strictly follow the admission procedures, and to adhere to the standards for Party members. I believe that the same principle of active prudence should be implemented in the work of admitting intellectuals into the Party. On the one hand, we should overcome the tendency of closed-doorism, actively educate and develop intellectuals, and admit those who meet the requirements for Party membership into the Party. On the other hand, when admitting intellectuals into the Party, we must adopt a serious and prudent attitude, carefully examine their political history, assess their level of class consciousness, strictly follow the admission procedures, and adhere to the standards for Party members, so as not to lower the quality of Party members and to prevent counter-revolutionaries and other bad elements from infiltrating the Party.

### 积极慎重地吸收知识分子入党  党员来信

    积极慎重地吸收知识分子入党
    ——党员来信——
    编者按：任何一个党组织接收党员，事前必须对发展对象进行长期的教育和考察，在发展对象确实具备入党条件以后，才可以着手接收入党，并按照党章规定办理入党手续。举行新党员入党宣誓仪式，不是入党必经的手续。但在办理入党手续以后，举行一次宣誓大会，借以对非党积极分子进行一次教育，也是可以的。可是，为了追求入党宣誓大会的形式，而马马虎虎接收党员，如衡阳市委组织部的作法，却是不容许的。个别地方把举行入党宣誓大会，当做轰开在知识分子中发展党员工作的局面的方法，则更是错误的。
    应当认识，在知识分子中发展党员，和在其它方面发展党员一样，应该是党组织在非党积极分子中进行长期而有效的教育工作和细致地考察工作的结果，决不能草率从事。只有这样，才能保证所接收的党员的质量。
    编辑同志：
    今年三月十一日，衡阳市委组织部给我们厂（衡阳矿山机械厂）党委打来一个电话，说本市最近就要接收一批知识分子入党，其中有你们厂的两位工程师。工厂党委说这样做显得太仓促。可是第二天，接到市委组织部的书面通知：“十四日举行知识分子入党宣誓大会”。当天下午，市委组织部又派干部来找我厂督促给这两位工程师办理入党手续，保证这两位工程师一定要参加十四日的入党宣誓大会。当时党委书记向市委组织部同志说明，这两人中有一个人还没有申请入党，支部对这两人的入党问题都还没有作过研究；因此，要求推迟几天。市委组织部的同志答复不能推迟；并且说：你们厂这两个人还是这次大会举行入党宣誓的主要人物哩（意思是说这两人是高级知识分子）！这样，党委书记只得先同还没有提出入党申请的某工程师谈话，动员他申请入党，并且要他立即写一份自传交给党委。十三日下午支部就召开党员大会讨论吸收某工程师入党的问题。会上，大家都感到奇怪。支部组织委员向大家说明“市委要召开新党员入党宣誓大会，要吸收某工程师入党。”这才勉强通过。另一支部，也是很仓促地讨论通过了某工程师入党的决定。支部大会通过这两人入党以后，党委会还没有讨论，市委组织部的同志就催促党委书记签字批准。党委书记说还没有经过党委会讨论，不能签字批准。市委组织部的同志说：你签字批准吧！市委负责。这样党委书记不得不签字，但是声明：我连他们的自传也没有来得及看，对他们的入党问题我不能负责。十四日下午，这两位工程师就参加了市委举办的新党员入党宣誓大会，宣誓入党了。
    党中央一再指示我们，在发展党员的工作中必须坚持积极慎重的方针，必须严格履行入党手续和坚持党员标准。我认为，在接收知识分子入党工作中，同样应该贯彻执行积极慎重的方针。一方面，应该克服关门主义倾向，积极地在知识分子中进行教育和发展工作，把具有党员条件的人接收到党内来；另一方面，在接收知识分子入党的时候，又必须采取严肃慎重的态度，认真地审查他们的政治历史，考察他们的阶级觉悟程度，严格履行入党手续，坚持党员条件，以免降低党员质量，以防止反革命分子及其他坏分子混入党内。
