    People in Tokyo are Excitedly Waiting
    By Pei Da, Our Correspondent
    Early summer in neighboring Japan is the "season of new green." Golden wheat awaits harvesting in the fields, and lush rice seedlings grow vigorously. The mountains and fields present a thriving scene. A gentle breeze blows from the emerald-like southeastern sea, making one feel extraordinarily refreshed. The Japanese people are greeting the arrival of this beautiful season with their hard work.
    Entering mid-May, the Kanto region has been experiencing continuous rainy days. With the early arrival of the plum rain season, disturbing news came from the Pacific: on the 21st, the United States began testing hydrogen bombs on Bikini Atoll. The atomic bomb tragedies that occurred in Hiroshima and Nagasaki more than a decade ago, and the tragedy of the "Lucky Dragon No. 5" fishing boat encountering the U.S. hydrogen bomb test two years ago, seemed like dark clouds hanging over the hearts of the Japanese people. Newspapers everywhere reported protests from all sectors of Japanese society. The Tokyo Mothers' Congress issued a declaration: Stop hydrogen bomb tests!
    At the same time, newspapers and radio stations continuously broadcast good news from China: the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe, led by Mei Lanfang, was coming to Japan for a visit and performance. "Welcome the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe to Japan" and "Friendship between the Japanese and Chinese people" were beautiful words that appeared extensively in articles by famous Japanese artists and scholars. The photos and stills of Mei Lanfang and other outstanding Chinese Peking Opera actors published in newspapers aroused the interest of millions of readers.
    People from all walks of life in Tokyo enthusiastically studied articles introducing Peking Opera, preparing to appreciate Chinese classical drama to satisfy their long-held wishes. However, many people had barely learned about the ticket sales when the tickets were already sold out.
    On the morning of May 19th, long lines formed in front of ticket agencies throughout Tokyo. The Tokyo Kabukiza Grand Theatre began selling tickets at 9:00 AM, and sold out all 3,500 tickets in less than three hours. Other agencies were also in short supply.
    A student from the Faculty of Education at Tokyo University of Education, who managed to squeeze in and buy a Peking Opera ticket, excitedly said: "We Japanese youth want to learn from the excellent arts of all countries, especially to see the world-renowned Peking Opera. Thank you to China for sending such a good troupe." Kobayashi Ryuji, Managing Director of Toko Bussan Co., Ltd., who bought thirty first-class tickets, said: "Our company wants to entertain the leaders of the machinery manufacturing and financial sectors. We will have them see the bright art of China, which will be beneficial to the expansion of Japan-China trade." The Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association had already purchased some Peking Opera tickets for people in the theater and cultural circles. They designated the 31st and 1st as "Viewing Days" and prepared to go to the theater collectively to appreciate Chinese classical art.
    The "Asahi Shimbun" newspaper and the Japan-China Friendship Association, which are responsible for hosting the Peking Opera performances, have recently received a large number of letters requesting to purchase tickets. The number of visiting guests is also overwhelming. On May 23rd, nine young women went to the Japan-China Friendship Association together to inquire about purchasing tickets. Among these women were bank clerks, dressmakers, and night university students. They lived in Nishi-Ogikubo in Tokyo and organized a Chinese language study group. To prepare for watching Peking Opera, each of them bought a copy of the "People's China" magazine which contained articles introducing Peking Opera. When they learned that the tickets were sold out, they expressed great regret. Some people also requested the Japan-China Friendship Association, saying: "Even if we can't see Peking Opera, we would be happy to see the Peking Opera actors."
    In these days, cultural exchange activities are constantly unfolding. Following the exhibition of Dunhuang murals in Tokyo in April, from May 18th to 21st, the Japan-China Buddhist Exchange Conference held a "Chinese Buddhist Art Exhibition" on the upper floor of a watch shop on Ginza Avenue in Tokyo. On the 20th alone, more than 2,000 people visited the exhibition. The former and current administrative vice-ministers of the Japanese Ministry of Education also went to appreciate Chinese ancient art. Iwanami Shoten and other bookstores have recently published Japanese versions of the "Selected Works of Lu Xun" (Volume 3), "Gao Yu Bao," and "Iron Torrent." The Tokyo Toyohashi Art Theater is currently rehearsing "Fang Zhenzhu," scheduled to premiere in early June. It is said that the pipa brought to Japan by the Chinese table tennis team will be used during the performance. This event has also aroused the interest of many people. Toho Film Company is speeding up the work of filming the "Legend of the White Snake."
    May 26th – The day that the people of Tokyo have been eagerly awaiting has arrived. After noon that day, the dark clouds scattered, and the sky suddenly cleared. Thousands of people flocked to Haneda Airport to welcome Mei Lanfang and the last group of the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe visiting Japan. At the airport, the five-star red flags held high by overseas Chinese in Japan fluttered in the wind, and Japanese friends from all walks of life smiled happily. Girls in festive costumes patiently selected the most beautiful flowers in the flower shop, preparing to present them to the friendly envoys from China. As the plane landed, the song "The East is Red" and cheers of "Hello, Mr. Mei!" "Hello, Chinese artists!" resounded from the airport stands. Prominent Japanese figures such as Tetsu Katayama, Jiichiro Matsumoto, and Koreya Senda shook hands with Mei Lanfang, Ouyang Yuqian, and others with joy. In the midst of the welcoming sounds, Leader Mei delivered a speech, congratulating the further prosperity of cultural and artistic exchanges between China and Japan! And wishing the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people to deepen! At this time, warm applause rang out at the airport. The great friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people was once again captured by the lenses of hundreds of cameras.
    The 30th – The day of the first performance of the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe in Japan is approaching, and the people of Tokyo are waiting for that joyous moment as if a day is like a thousand autumns.

    东京的人们在兴奋地等待着
    本报记者　裴达
    初夏，在邻邦日本正是“新绿季节”。田间金黄色的麦子等待着收割，青青的稻苗在茁壮地生长，山野草木呈现一副欣欣向荣的景象。微风从那绿宝石般的东南海面吹来，使人感到异常清爽。日本人民正以他们的辛勤劳动迎接着这美好季节的到来。
    进入五月中旬，关东地带连天阴雨。随着梅雨的提早到来，从太平洋传来了令人不安的消息：二十一日美国在比基尼岛开始试验氢弹了。十多年前在广岛、长崎发生的原子弹悲剧，两年前“福龙丸”渔船因美国试验氢弹所遭遇的惨事，好似乌云一样涌上了日本人民的心头。各地报纸纷纷传出日本各界的抗议呼声。东京母亲大会发表宣言：停止氢弹试验！
    在这同一时刻里，报纸和广播电台不断传出来自中国的喜讯：以梅兰芳为首的中国访日京剧代表团就要来日本作访问演出了。“欢迎中国京剧团来日”、“日中人民的友谊”等美好的语言，大量出现在日本著名艺术家、学者的文章之中。报纸上刊载的梅兰芳等中国优秀京剧演员的照片和剧照，引起了千百万读者的兴趣。
    东京各界人士热心地研读着介绍京剧的文章，准备把中国古典戏剧好好地欣赏一番，以满足他们长久以来的愿望。但是，当许多人刚刚知道开始卖票的消息，戏票早就抢购一空了。
    五月十九日一清早，东京各处的戏票代卖所门前就排上了长长的行列。东京歌舞伎座大剧院从九时开始售票，不到三个小时就把三千五百张戏票卖光了。其他代卖所也都供不应求。
    东京教育大学教育学部二十级的一位学生挤着买到了一张京剧票，兴高采烈地说：“我们日本青年要向各国的优良艺术学习，特别要看一看闻名世界的京剧。感谢中国派来了这样好的剧团。”买了三十张一等票的东工物产株式会社常务董事小林隆治说：“我们公司要招待机器制造业和金融界的首脑。请他们看看中国的明朗的艺术，以利于日中贸易的扩展。”日中文化交流协会早就为戏剧界和文化界人士定购了一些京剧票。他们把三十一日和一日定为“观剧日”，准备集体去剧院鉴赏中国的古典艺术。
    负责主持京剧演出的“朝日新闻”社和日中友好协会，最近收到了大量的请求购买戏票的信件。来访的客人更是应接不暇。五月二十三日，有九位年轻的姑娘一起去访日中友好协会，打听购票的事情。这些姑娘中，有银行的事务员，有洋服店的裁缝，还有夜大学的学生。她们住在东都西荻洼，自己组织了一个中国语研究会。为了准备看京剧，每一个人都买了一本有介绍京剧文章的“人民中国”杂志。当知道戏票已经售完的时候，她们表示非常遗憾。还有的人向日中友好协会提出要求说：“看不到京剧，看一看京剧演员也是高兴的。”
    在这些日子里文化交流的活动正在不断展开。继四月间敦煌壁画在东京展出之后，五月十八日到二十一日，日中佛教交流恳谈会在东京银座大街一家钟表店的楼上，举办了“中国佛教美术展览”。仅二十日一天前往参观的就有两千多人。日本文部省前任和现任的事务次官也去鉴赏了中国古代美术。岩波等书店最近出版了“鲁迅选集”（第三卷）、“高玉宝”、“铁水奔流”等日文版。东京丰桥艺术剧场最近正在排演“方珍珠”，预定在下月初公演。据说上演时将使用中国乒乓球代表队带到日本的琵琶。这件事也引起了许多人的兴趣。东宝电影公司拍摄“白蛇传”影片的工作正在加紧进行中。
    五月二十六日——东京的人们迫切期待的一天来到了。这一天时过中午，阴云四散，天空突然开朗。成千的人涌向羽田飞机场，去迎接梅兰芳等最后一批中国访日京剧代表团人员的到来。机场上，旅日侨胞高举着的五星红旗迎风招展，日本各界友人喜笑颜开。穿着节日服装的姑娘，在花店耐心地选择了最美丽的鲜花，准备献给来自中国的友好使节。飞机着陆了，机场看台上响起了“东方红”的歌声以及“梅先生你好！”“中国艺术家们好啊！”的欢呼声。日本著名人士片山哲、松本治一郎、千田是也等，纷纷和梅兰芳、欧阳予倩等握手言欢。梅团长在欢迎声中致词，祝贺中日两国文化艺术交流进一步繁荣！祝中日两国人民的友谊更加深厚！这时，机场上响起了热烈的掌声。伟大的中日人民的友好情节，又一次纳入了成百架摄影机的镜头。
    三十日——中国访日京剧代表团首次公演的日子临近了，东京的人们一日千秋似地等待着那欢乐时刻的到来。
