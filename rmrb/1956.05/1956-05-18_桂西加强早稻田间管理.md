Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture strengthens field management of early rice.

The more than 6.5 million mu of early rice in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture has generally turned green, and farmers of all ethnic groups are actively carrying out field management work. In the seven counties of Yongning, Hengxian, Binyang, and Wuming, which are the main double-cropping rice producing areas, the vast majority of early rice fields have been weeded for the first time, with an average application of 10 to 20 dan of topdressing fertilizer per mu of rice field.

In the weeding work, agricultural cooperatives in various places also promptly organized members to carry out crash programs to accumulate fertilizer. The Naliang Agricultural Cooperative in Hengxian County accumulated 40,000 dan of various fertilizers within a few days.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch

The autonomous prefecture's early rice planting area this year has doubled compared to last year, and in some areas, the rice seedlings have already grown to over one chi in height.

    桂西加强早稻田间管理
    桂西僮族自治州六百五十多万亩早稻普遍转青，各族农民正在积极进行田间管理工作。双季稻主要产区的邕宁、横县、宾阳、武鸣等七个县，早稻田绝大部分耘完了第一次，每亩稻田平均施追肥十担到二十担。
    在耘田工作中，各地农业合作社还及时组织社员突击积肥。横县那良农业合作社在几天之内就积了各种肥料四万多担。
    自治州今年早稻播种面积比去年扩大一倍，现在有些地区的禾苗已经长到一尺多高。　（据新华社讯）
