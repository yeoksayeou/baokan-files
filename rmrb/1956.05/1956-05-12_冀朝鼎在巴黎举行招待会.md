Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 10th: Paris Dispatch: The most grand reception in Paris this year was held on the evening of the 9th at the auditorium of the Chinese Ambassador's Office. The host of the reception was Ji Chao Ding, head of the Chinese International Trade Promotion Committee's Exhibition Group participating in the Paris Exposition.

More than 1,350 guests representing all sectors of French society drank Chinese wine and chatted happily with members of the Chinese Exhibition Group at the reception. Melodious Chinese music was constantly transmitted from loudspeakers.

The gathering of important figures from French business and industry in the hall was rare. Among them were Mr. Viellé, Chairman of the National Council of French Employers, and heads of major enterprises in French business, industry, and banking circles, as well as Mr. Buoylla, Chairman of the Paris Exposition, Mr. Deleuze, General Manager, and members of the Exposition Committee.

Guests included Mr. Daniel Mayer, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French National Assembly, Mr. Rochereau, Chairman of the Economic Affairs Committee of the Council of the Republic, and Mr. Bride, a member of parliament, as well as representatives from the French government's Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs.

Celebrities and famous professors from the French literary and journalistic circles also attended.

Also invited were the Soviet Ambassador to France and diplomatic envoys from other countries, Dr. Lessing, Chairman of the Foreign Trade Association of the German Democratic Republic, Mr. Adamec, Chairman of the Czechoslovak Chamber of Commerce, and Dr. Roglatti, Secretary-General of the Austrian Association for the Promotion of East-West Trade.

Ji Chao Ding said in his speech at the reception: "We highly value the friendly contacts and trade relations that have been established between the Chinese and French peoples, and we hope that, through the joint efforts of both sides, this relationship will be increasingly enhanced and strengthened in the future."

Ji Chao Ding used the facts of China's economic construction and development to illustrate the broad prospects for developing trade relations between China and Western European countries. He said: "We are willing to develop trade with Western European countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. But unfortunately, there are still artificial obstacles. We believe that if trade relations can be normalized, trade between China and Western European countries will greatly develop. This will be beneficial to the economic prosperity of each other and the improvement of people's lives. We hope that this exhibition will be beneficial to further enhancing the development of normal trade between China and Western European countries."

Finally, on behalf of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Ji Chao Ding expressed his gratitude to the Paris municipal authorities, the organizers of the exhibition, and people from all walks of life for their assistance and support during the exhibition of the Chinese Pavilion.

    冀朝鼎在巴黎举行招待会
    新华社柏林10日电　巴黎消息：九日晚间在巴黎大使礼堂举行了今年以来巴黎最盛大的一次招待会，招待会的主人是中国国际贸易促进委员会参加巴黎博览会展览团团长冀朝鼎。
    代表着法国社会各界的一千三百五十多位来宾在招待会上喝着中国酒，同中国展览团人员愉快地交谈。悠扬的中国音乐从扩音器中不断传出。
    在大厅里，聚集着法国工商界重要人物之多是少有的。里面有法国全国雇主协会主席维伊埃和法国工商界、银行界各重要企业的负责人，巴黎博览会主席布伊拉、总经理德勒兹和博览会的委员们。
    来宾中有法国国民议会外交委员会主席丹尼埃·麦耶，共和国参议院经济事务委员会主席罗谢罗和议员布里德，以及法国政府财政经济部的代表。
    法国文艺界、新闻界名流和名教授们也来了。
    应邀到会的还有苏联驻法国大使和其他国家的外交使节，德意志民主共和国对外贸易协会主席勒辛博士，捷克斯洛伐克商会主席阿达麦克，奥地利促进东西方贸易协会秘书长罗格拉第博士等。
    冀朝鼎在招待会上致词说：“我们非常珍视中法两国人民已经建立起的友好联系和贸易关系，并希望今后在双方的共同努力下这种关系将日益增进与加强。”
    冀朝鼎以中国经济建设发展的事实说明中国与西欧国家发展贸易关系的广阔前途。他说：“我们愿意同西欧国家在平等互利的基础上发展贸易。但遗憾的是，现在还存在着人为的障碍。我们相信，如果贸易关系能够正常化，中国同西欧国家的贸易都会有很大的发展。这对于彼此经济的繁荣和人民生活的提高都是有好处的。我们希望这次的展出将对进一步增进中国和西欧各国间正常贸易的发展有所裨益。”
    冀朝鼎最后代表中国国际贸易促进委员会对于巴黎市政当局、博览会组织者和各界人士在中国馆展出过程中给予的协助和支持表示感谢。
