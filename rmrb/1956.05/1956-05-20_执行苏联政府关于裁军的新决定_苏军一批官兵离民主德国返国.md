At the Falkenberg train station in the Cottbus district, citizens, as well as representatives of workers, youth, and Young Pioneers, bid farewell to the Soviet soldiers. The rally held to welcome and send off this group of Soviet soldiers demonstrated the profound friendship between the people of the two countries, Germany and the Soviet Union.
