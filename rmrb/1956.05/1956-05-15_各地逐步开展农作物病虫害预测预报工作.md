Pest and disease forecasting for crops is being progressively implemented nationwide.

Currently, 144 pest and disease forecasting stations (points) have been established in 22 provinces and cities across the country, and 14 provinces have also established pest and disease forecasting research offices. Based on needs and conditions, many agricultural technology extension stations, agricultural experiment stations, and state-owned farms have become pest and disease information points; many agricultural production cooperative technicians and agricultural technical school teachers have also been hired as pest and disease information officers. A mass pest and disease information network is taking shape in various regions.

Areas that have established a crop pest and disease forecasting system have begun to take the initiative in prevention and control, achieving timely and effective results. After Henan Province established 210 wheat blossom midge information points, it clarified the area where wheat blossom midge would occur and selected the most severely affected areas for chemical control, with good results. According to the activity of rice stem borers, the ten rice stem borer forecasting stations in Qionglai County, Sichuan Province, promptly notified all agricultural cooperatives in the county to concentrate on prevention and control within a short period.

This year, the Ministry of Agriculture and local agricultural departments have trained a group of crop pest and disease forecasting cadres. In February, the Ministry of Agriculture held its first crop pest and disease forecasting training class, training more than 180 plant protection workers from various regions. Liaoning, Shandong, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Henan, Inner Mongolia and other places have also held training classes or seminars to enable a group of cadres and agricultural cooperative technicians to take charge of pest and disease information work.

    各地逐步开展农作物病虫害预测预报工作
    农作物病虫害预测预报工作正在全国范围内逐步开展。
    现在全国已有二十二个省、市共建立144个病虫害预测预报站（点），有十四个省还建立了病虫害预测预报研究室。根据需要和条件，许多农业技术推广站、农业试验站、国营农场已成为病虫情报点；不少农业生产合作社的技术员和农业技术学校的教员也被聘为病虫情报员。群众性的病虫情报网正在各地形成起来。
    建立农作物病虫害预测预报制度的地区，在防治上已开始掌握主动，做到及时有效。河南省建立二百一十个小麦吸浆虫情报点后，弄清了将要发生小麦吸浆虫的面积，并且选定了比较严重的地区用药剂防治，效果良好。四川省邛崃县十个稻螟预测站根据螟蛾活动情况，及时通知全县各农业社在短期内集中展开防治。
    今年农业部和各地农业部门曾培养了一批农作物病虫害预测预报干部。农业部在二月间首次举办了农作物病虫害预测预报训练班，调训各地植物保护工作人员一百八十多人。辽宁、山东、四川、陕西、甘肃、河南、内蒙古等地也先后举办训练班或召开座谈会，使一批干部和农业社技术员担负起病虫情报工作。
