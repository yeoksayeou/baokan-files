Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 19th - A sugar refinery with a daily crushing capacity of 1,200 tons of sugarcane recently broke ground in Mulan Township, Xianyou County, Fujian Province. The sugar refinery will employ fully mechanized production processes. At the same time, two of the three medium-sized mechanized sugar refineries planned for construction with daily crushing capacities of 250 tons and 350 tons or more have already begun construction in Yunxiao and Dufeng. In addition, thirty-eight semi-mechanized sugar refineries with daily crushing capacities of 30 tons to 100 tons have also successively begun construction. Thus, by this year's sugarcane crushing season, the daily crushing capacity of mechanized and semi-mechanized sugar refineries throughout the province will increase by about eleven times compared to last year.

After the Xianyou sugar refinery goes into production in the next sugarcane crushing season, Fujian Province will be able to supply more than 50,000 tons of high-quality, low-priced machine-made sugar to all parts of the country each year.

Sugarcane production in southern Fujian Province is growing daily. However, at present, only about 4% of the province's sugarcane production is crushed entirely by machines. The remaining 96% or so, which is crushed and processed into cane sugar using manual, indigenous methods, is of poor quality and high cost, and suffers significant losses due to backward operations. The industrial departments of Fujian Province, based on the development of sugarcane production, have formulated a comprehensive plan for the development of the sugar industry. This year, investment in Fujian Province's sugar industry accounts for 29% of the province's local industrial investment. Overseas Chinese from Fujian are also enthusiastic about investing in industrial construction. The largest Xianyou sugar refinery is entirely funded by overseas Chinese investment.

In order to increase the sugar extraction rate of manual sugar production and avoid losses, the Fujian Provincial Department of Industry plans to establish a specialized agency to strengthen the management of indigenous sugar workshops. The Department of Industry has adjusted the unreasonable phenomenon of some areas having a high sugarcane yield but few sugar workshops, while other areas have a low sugarcane yield but many sugar workshops; For some sugar workshops that are to be eliminated, sugarcane farmers with technical skills who rely on sugar production as their main income will be recruited to work in sugar refineries, and sugarcane farmers or handicraft workers who have some skills but do not rely on this for their livelihood will be recruited as temporary workers in sugar refineries.

### 福建省兴建四十多个糖厂

    福建省兴建四十多个糖厂
    新华社福州19日电　一座日榨甘蔗一千二百吨的糖厂，最近在福建省仙游县木兰乡动工兴建。这个糖厂的生产过程全部采用机械。同时，计划兴建的日榨二百五十吨和三百五十吨以上的三个中型机械化糖厂，已经有两个开始在云霄、渡峰开始动工建设。另外，三十八个日榨三十吨到一百吨的半机械化糖厂，也已经陆续动工兴建。这样，到今年榨糖季，全省机械化和半机械化的糖厂日榨能力将比去年增加十一倍左右。
    仙游糖厂在明年榨糖季投入生产以后，福建省每年可向全国各地供应质好价廉的机制糖五万多吨。
    福建省南部甘蔗生产日益发展。但目前全部用机器压榨的甘蔗只占全省甘蔗产量的4％左右。占96％左右的用手工土法压榨制作的蔗糖，质量差，成本高，因操作落后损失很大。福建省工业部门根据甘蔗生产发展的情况，已经制定了全面发展制糖工业的计划。今年福建省制糖工业的投资占全省地方工业投资的29％。福建省旅外华侨也热心投资参加工业建设。最大的仙游糖厂全部是华侨投资的。
    为提高手工制糖的出糖率和避免损失，福建省工业厅计划成立专门机构，加强土糖坊管理。工业厅对某些地方甘蔗产量多、糖坊少，而某些地方却甘蔗产量少、糖坊多的不合理现象做了调整；对某些要淘汰的糖坊，也将把有技术的以制糖为主要收入的蔗农吸收到糖厂做工，把有些技术但不以此为生的蔗农或手工业工人吸收到糖厂作临时工。
