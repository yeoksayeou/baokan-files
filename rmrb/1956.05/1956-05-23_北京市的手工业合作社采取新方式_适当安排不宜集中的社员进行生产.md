    Beijing Handicraft Cooperatives Adopt New Methods
    Appropriately Arrange Production for Members Unsuitable for Centralized Production
    Beijing's handicraft cooperatives are addressing the difficulties faced by some members who find it inconvenient to participate in centralized production by organizing their production in new ways.
    Among these members, some have large families and heavy burdens. If they participate in centralized production, their family's auxiliary labor cannot assist in production, leading to a decrease in income. Others find it difficult to care for the elderly and weak at home if they participate in centralized production. Still others are elderly or frail, making commuting inconvenient. The Beijing Municipal Handicraft Production Cooperative Federation, based on their different situations, organizes them as decentralized supply and marketing households, each calculating its own profits and losses, or implements decentralized production with the cooperative calculating the overall profits and losses. For those members who are not suitable for decentralized production but have more family auxiliary labor, appropriate arrangements are made for the production of family auxiliary labor, enabling them to increase their income.
    Members are very satisfied with this adjustment. After Tuo Changshan, a member of the Beihecao Toy Production Cooperative, switched to being a supply and marketing household, the elderly and children in his family were not only able to receive his care, but could also help him with production. Liu Yiqing, a member of the Fifty-Fifth Gold Production Cooperative who is over sixty years old, had to walk more than two *li* to work every day when production was centralized. After the adjustment, she has now returned home to produce and is very grateful to the cooperative for its care. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    北京市的手工业合作社采取新方式
    适当安排不宜集中的社员进行生产
    北京市的手工业合作社照顾有些社员不便于集中生产的困难，用新的方式组织他们生产。
    这些社员中，有的是因为家庭人口多，负担重，本人集中生产后，家庭辅助劳动力不能帮助生产，收入减少；有的集中生产后，家中老弱无人照顾；有的本人年老体弱，上下班不方便。市手工业生产合作社联合总社根据他们的不同情况，把他们组织为分散的供销户，各自计算盈亏，或者实行分散生产，由合作社统一计算盈亏。对那些不适宜分散生产而家庭辅助劳动力较多的社员，就适当安排家庭辅助劳动力的生产，使他们能增加收入。
    这样调整后，社员们都很满意。北河漕玩具生产合作社社员陀长山改为供销户以后，他家中的老人和小孩不但能得到他的照顾，而且可以帮助他生产。第五十五金生产合作社六十多岁的社员刘义清，在集中生产时每天上班要走两里多路，调整后现在已回家生产，她非常感谢合作社对她的照顾。　（据新华社讯）
