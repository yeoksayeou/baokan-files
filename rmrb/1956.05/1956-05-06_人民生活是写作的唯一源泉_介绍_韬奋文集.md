People's Life is the Only Source of Writing
    ——Introducing "Selected Works of Taofen"
    Hu Yuzhi
    The three-volume set of "Selected Works of Taofen" has been published in its entirety not long ago.

    Taofen – this name is not so familiar to the younger generation now. However, intellectuals over the age of thirty-five, as long as they have experienced the hardships of the old society, still retain a deep impression of Taofen as a person and the "Shenghuo" (Life) Weekly he ran.

    More than twenty years ago, China's national crisis was very profound. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, the people were oppressed to the point of suffocation, and everyone used anger to confront the bloody suppression of the reactionary ruling class. The "Shenghuo" Weekly, run by Taofen, became the most widely sold and influential publication in the Kuomintang-controlled areas at the time. Despite the Kuomintang government's use of bans on transportation and mailing, as well as various other methods of sabotage, the "Shenghuo" Weekly still reached a circulation of over 150,000 copies per issue at its peak, a figure that no other public publication in the Kuomintang areas could achieve at the time. Later, when the "Shenghuo" Weekly was officially banned, the "Shenghuo" Bookstore published new publications under different names. As long as the publication contained articles by Taofen, it immediately had a wide circulation. From all levels of society in China to overseas Chinese, millions of young people regarded the publications run by Taofen as indispensable spiritual food. The "Short Commentaries" written by Taofen played a powerful propaganda and mobilizing role in the Kuomintang areas before and after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War.

    As Chairman Mao Zedong's inscription says: "Loving the people, sincerely serving the people, dedicating oneself to the utmost, and dying only after one's work is done – this is the spirit of Mr. Zou Taofen, and this is why he is so moving."

    Loving the people and faithfully serving the people is a major hallmark of the transformation of intellectuals who came from the old society.

    From some of the articles and "Experiences" written by Taofen in his early years, it can be seen that Taofen came from a feudal bureaucratic family and received an Anglo-American capitalist education in his early years. His ideological transformation was relatively late. It was not until after the "September 18th" Incident that he began to have an understanding of the path of the Chinese revolution. He traveled and studied in Europe in 1933 and in the Soviet Union in 1934, and only then did he gradually break away from bourgeois idealism and establish a materialist worldview. The path taken by Taofen was precisely the path taken by countless Chinese intellectuals before and after him towards progress and revolution. However, Taofen was different from some petty-bourgeois intellectuals in that after he began to transform, he immediately bravely and resolutely embarked on the road of revolution, without wavering, without hesitation, and no difficulty could stop him from moving forward, until his death.

    "Experiences," "Since the War of Resistance," and "Surviving Hardships" are the trilogy of Taofen's short life, written in his unique style. These autobiographical articles are full of love for the motherland and the people, and infinite loyalty to the revolution. At the same time, Taofen also truthfully and deeply wrote about the process of his own ideological struggle. He never concealed his ideological mistakes, nor was he afraid to expose his shortcomings. In his early articles, he already said: "There is no perfect thing in the world; the most important thing is to have a constant desire to strive for progress." (Selected Works, Volume 1, page 14) It is precisely because Taofen's articles are full of enthusiasm for seeking progress and seeking truth that they still possess a tremendous power to attract and inspire people even today.

    From 1926, when Taofen took over the "Shenghuo" Weekly, until he died in exile from illness, he published approximately one thousand essays, notes, and miscellaneous thoughts in newspapers and magazines. Currently, 146 of these are preserved in the first volume of the "Selected Works," arranged in chronological order from 1927 to 1941. This selection is appropriate. From these articles, one can clearly see the process of Taofen's ideological transformation. As the "Preface" by the editorial committee of "Selected Works of Taofen" says, "From the process of Taofen's ideological development, one can see the law of ideological development of revolutionary intellectuals in semi-colonial and semi-feudal Chinese society." He gradually transformed from a bourgeois reformist to a socialist, and from a pragmatist idealist to a Marxist. At the time, the path Taofen experienced was far more difficult than the path of ideological transformation for intellectuals today. However, even today, not every intellectual has resolutely jumped out of the quagmire of bourgeois reactionary thought. Despite the fact that the political attitudes of Chinese intellectuals have generally made significant progress in recent years, it is still not an easy task to transform people who have been influenced by the old society for a long time into completely socialist intellectuals. Therefore, Taofen's life experience and most of his works still have realistic educational significance today.

    Taofen was forced to go abroad in 1933 and spent less than two years traveling in Western Europe, the Soviet Union, and the United States, writing 370,000 words of travelogues. These travelogues are now compiled into the second volume of the "Selected Works." They are also written by Taofen in his own unique style. The main focus is on writing about the lives of the people, and the tone is so bright and lively that it makes people feel as if they are there themselves. At that time, international capitalism was superficially stable, the fascist forces of Germany and Italy were rising, and the Soviet Union was in the period of its second five-year plan, surrounded by imperialism, and facing great difficulties. However, through very keen observation, Taofen had already affirmed that capitalism was bound to perish and socialism was bound to triumph. These travelogues are full of love for new things and hatred for decadent society, and they are still masterpieces of reportage literature today.

    Finally, it can be proved from the "Selected Works of Taofen" that people's life is the inexhaustible and inexhaustible sole source of all literature and art. Taofen attached the greatest importance to the lives of the people. His purpose in running publications and writing articles was to express the thoughts and feelings of the masses of the people. As early as 1927, in the article explaining his motivation for founding "Shenghuo" Weekly, Taofen said: "The bitter life of farmers, the bitter life of workers, the bitter life of apprentices, and even the bitter life of coolies, the bitter life of maids... are all materials that have been published in this journal, that is, this journal appeals to society on behalf of the most suffering part of the people." (Selected Works, Volume 1, page 5) Taofen's political articles generally reflected the inner demands of the masses of the people at that time and in that place. He often said that each "Short Commentary" of less than a thousand words took a lot of time to consider what was the most concerned and anxious issue for the majority of people at the moment. Many articles were written after collective discussions and then synthesizing opinions from various aspects. Taofen's writing style was lively and accessible; he opposed monotonous and empty discussions and tried to avoid obscure and difficult words and sentences. He often said: Articles "must be in line with the real needs of the masses... must be suitable for the receptivity of the masses." (Selected Works, Volume 1, page 156)

    Taofen, as an outstanding and successful political commentator and journalist, had no other secret, but was able to draw the source of article writing from the real life of the people. He never left the people, never left life. People's life is inherently the most rich and colorful, the most vibrant. An author who truly loves the people and faithfully serves the people has found an inexhaustible source of writing, and his writing style will never be dry and boring. In this way, Taofen's articles can have the power to attract and persuade people, and play a good role in the revolutionary cause of the people.

    Today, in the new China marching towards a socialist society, the life of the people is far more vivid and richer than when Taofen was engaged in writing. Many new things are worth cultivating and encouraging, and many old dregs need to be swept away. But some of our writers are complaining that there is nothing to write about. And the articles that are written are often dry and lifeless, failing to satisfy the readers. This is not a desirable phenomenon. We should also reread Taofen's articles and learn some good things from them.

　　人民生活是写作的唯一源泉
    ——介绍“韬奋文集”
    胡愈之
    “韬奋文集”三卷集，在不久以前已经全部出版了。
    韬奋——这个名字，对于现在还年轻的一代，是并不那么熟悉的。可是，三十五岁以上的知识分子，只要是经历过旧社会的辛酸苦辣的，对于韬奋这个人和他所主办的生活周刊，至今都还会保留着深刻的印象吧。
    在二十多年前，中国民族危机正十分深重。在国民党统治区内，人民被压迫得喘不过气来，大家用愤怒来对待反动统治阶级的血腥镇压。韬奋所主办的生活周刊成为当时国民党统治地区内销行最广、影响最大的读物。尽管国民党政府采取了禁运禁寄以及各种方法加以摧残，生活周刊销行最多时每期仍达十五万份以上，这个销数是当时国民党地区任何公开刊物所不能达到的。到后来，生活周刊被正式查封了，生活书店就用另外名称出版新的刊物。只要这个刊物上面登载着韬奋的文章，立刻就有广大的销路。从国内各阶层到海外华侨，千千万万的青年人都把韬奋所主办的刊物，当作不可缺少的精神食粮。韬奋所写的“小言论”，在抗日战争爆发前后的国民党地区内，起了强有力的宣传鼓动作用。
    正如毛泽东主席的题词中所说：“热爱人民，真诚地为人民服务，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已，这就是邹韬奋先生的精神，这就是他之所以感动人的地方。”
    热爱人民，忠诚地为人民服务，这是从旧社会出身的知识分子改造的一个主要标志。
    从韬奋早年所写的一些文章和“经历”中可以看出，韬奋是从封建官僚家庭出身，早年受了英美资本主义的教育。他的思想转变是比较迟的。“九一八”事变以后，他才开始对于中国革命的道路有了认识。1933年到欧洲，1934年到苏联游历学习，他才从资产阶级的唯心主义逐渐摆脱，树立了唯物主义世界观。韬奋所走的道路，正是在他以前和在他以后中国无数知识分子走向进步、走向革命的道路。但是韬奋和某些小资产阶级知识分子不相同，他在开始转变以后，立即勇敢地坚决地走向革命的道路，不动摇，不犹豫，任何困难都不能阻挡他前进，一直到死为止。
    “经历”、“抗战以来”和“患难余生记”，是韬奋短短的一生的三部曲，是他用他的独特的风格写成的。这些自传体的文章，充满了对祖国、对人民的热爱，对革命的无限忠诚。同时，韬奋也如实地深刻地写出了他自己思想斗争的过程。他从不掩盖自己的思想错误，也不害怕暴露自己的缺点。他在早期的文章里就已经说：“天下无十全的东西，最要紧的是要有常常力求进步的心愿”。（文集，一卷，十四页）正因为韬奋的文章，充满着求进步求真理的热情，所以直到现在，仍然具有吸引人和鼓舞人的一种巨大力量。
    从1926年韬奋接办生活周刊起到他流亡病死为止，他在报刊上发表的论文、随笔、杂感，约计有一千篇左右，现在在文集第一卷保留的是146篇，按年代排列次序，从1927年起，到1941年为止。这样的编选是恰当的。从这些文章里，可以清楚地看出韬奋思想转变的过程。正如“韬奋文集”编辑委员会的“代序”中所说，“从韬奋思想发展的过程，可以看出半殖民地、半封建的中国社会的革命知识分子思想发展的规律。”他由一个资产阶级改良主义者逐渐转变为社会主义者，由一个倾向实用主义的唯心论者逐渐转变为马克思主义者。当时，韬奋所经历的道路远比今天知识分子改造的道路艰难。但是，就在今天，并不是每一知识分子都已经坚决地跳出资产阶级反动思想的泥坑了。尽管这几年来，中国知识分子的政治态度，一般都有显著的进步，但是长期受旧社会影响的人们，改造成为完全社会主义的知识分子，仍然是一件不十分容易的事。因此，韬奋的一生经历和他的大部分著作，在今天还有现实的教育意义。
    韬奋在1933年被迫出国，以后在不到两年的时间，游历西欧、苏联和美国，写了三十七万字的游记。这些游记，现在被编入文集第二卷。它们也是韬奋用他所特有的文体写的。其中主要是写人民的生活，笔调是那么明朗轻快，使人读过一遍，感觉到和身历其境一样。当时正是国际资本主义在表面上稳定，德意法西斯势力抬头，而苏联处在第二个五年计划期间，遭受帝国主义包围，困难还很大。但是通过了十分锐敏的观察，韬奋已经肯定了资本主义必然灭亡，社会主义必然胜利。这些游记，充满了对于新鲜事物的喜爱以及对于腐朽社会的憎恶，至今仍然是报告文学中的杰作。
    最后，从“韬奋文集”可以证明这样的一个真理：人民生活是一切文学艺术的取之不尽、用之不竭的唯一源泉。韬奋最重视人民群众的生活。他办刊物、写文章的目的，就是为了表达人民大众的思想和情感。早在1927年，韬奋在说明创办生活周刊的动机的那篇文章里，曾经说：“农人的苦生活，工人的苦生活，学徒的苦生活，乃至工役的苦生活，女仆的苦生活……都是本刊已载过的材料，也就是本刊替民众里面最苦的部分，对于社会的呼吁。”（文集，一卷，五页）韬奋的政论文章，一般都是反映此时此地人民群众的内心要求。他时常说，每一篇不到一千字的“小言论”，在下笔以前，要费很多的时间考虑，什么是当前大多数人最关心最焦虑的问题。很多文章都是先经集体讨论，然后综合了各方面的意见写成的。韬奋的文风，生动活泼，浅易近人；他反对千篇一律的空洞议论，竭力避免深晦难懂的字句。他经常说：文章“要切合于大众的真正需要……要能适合于大众的容受性。”（文集，一卷，一五六页）
    韬奋，作为一个优秀的成功的政论家和新闻工作者，并没有别的窍门，只是能从现实的人民生活中，去吸取文章写作的源泉。他永远不离开人民，不离开生活。人民生活，本来是最丰富多采的，最生气勃勃的。一个作者，真正热爱人民，忠诚地为人民服务，他就找到了取之不竭，用之不尽的写作源泉，他的文风也决不会是枯燥无味的。就是这样，韬奋的文章，才能有吸引人说服人的力量，并且在人民的革命事业中，起了优良作用。
    今天，在走向社会主义社会的新中国，人民生活是远比韬奋从事写作的那时候更加生动，更加丰富了。很多新的事物值得培育和鼓励，很多旧的渣滓需要扫除。而我们，有些写作者却在诉苦，说是没有文章可写了。并且写出来的文章，往往是干巴巴的，缺乏生气，不能令读者满意。这是不应当有的现象。我们还应当重读一下韬奋的文章，从这里面学到一些好东西。
