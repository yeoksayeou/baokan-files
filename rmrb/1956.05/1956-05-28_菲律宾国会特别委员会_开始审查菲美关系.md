Xinhua News Agency, May 26th, Manila Dispatch: The Philippine Congressional Special Committee began reviewing the relations between the Philippines and the United States and the existing treaties between the two countries on May 25th.

This Congressional Special Committee was decided upon by the presidential palace and congressional leaders on April 6th, after Philippine political figures criticized the United States' policy towards the Philippines. Many congressmen, social leaders, and public opinion have accused the United States of restricting Philippine trade, establishing military bases in the Philippines, discriminating against Philippine workers, and a series of other unequal acts.

Speaker of the House Jose Laurel Jr., in talking about his requirements for the Special Committee, said: "We must revise some of our agreements that damage Philippine interests, especially those provisions that effectively deprive us of jurisdiction over the American bases here."

Laurel also said, "Repealing any existing treaty, convention, or agreement with the United States is definitely not feasible." He said, "We hope they can be improved."

    菲律宾国会特别委员会
    开始审查菲美关系
    新华社26日讯　马尼拉消息：菲律宾国会特别委员会从五月二十五日起开始审查菲律宾和美国的关系和两国之间现有的条约。
    这个国会特别委员会是在菲律宾政界人士抨击美国对菲律宾的政策以后，由总统府和国会领袖们在四月六日决定成立的。许多议员、社会领袖以及公众舆论纷纷指责美国限制菲律宾贸易、在菲律宾建立军事基地、歧视菲律宾工人等一系列不平等的行为。
    众议院议长小何塞·劳雷尔在谈到他对特别委员会的要求时说：“我们必须修改我们的某些损害菲律宾利益的协定，特别是那些使我们在实际上丧失对管辖这里美国基地的所有权的规定。”
    劳雷尔又说，“废除任何现有的和美国的条约、公约或协定，肯定是办不到的。”他说，“我们希望它们得到改善。”
