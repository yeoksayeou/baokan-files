    Chinese Higher Plant Classification Teaching Atlas Compiled by Professor Su Honghan
    Su Honghan, a professor at Central China Normal College, has completed a "Chinese Higher Plant Classification Teaching Atlas" with more than 130,000 words and more than 1,000 illustrations. This is the culmination of his three years of scientific research.
    This atlas includes more than 80 kinds of plants. Each plant is described in detail with its morphology, economic value, and some also include cultivation methods and high-yield experience. The illustrations are also very detailed.
    In this scientific research, Su Honghan was constantly busy with collecting, observing, recording, dissecting, or drawing, without interruption. Because the collected plants are prone to wilting, he often sacrificed rest to depict and study them in a timely manner, and sometimes he even went into the water to salvage various plants.
    The teachers of Central China Normal College admire the hard-working spirit of this more than fifty-year-old professor.

    中国高等植物分类教学图谱苏宏汉教授编绘完成
    华中师范学院教授苏宏汉完成了一部有十三万多字和一千多幅画图的“中国高等植物分类教学图谱”。这是他三年来科学研究的结晶。
    这本图谱包括八十多种植物，每种植物都详细地说明了它的形态、经济价值，有的还说明了栽培方法和丰产经验。画图也很精细。
    苏宏汉在这门科学研究中，经常忙于采集、观察、记载、解剖或绘图等工作，从不间断。由于采集的植物容易枯萎，他常常牺牲休息及时进行描绘和研究，有时他还下水打捞各种植物。
    华中师范学院教师们对这位五十多岁的老教授的刻苦研究的精神很敬佩。　　（新华社）
