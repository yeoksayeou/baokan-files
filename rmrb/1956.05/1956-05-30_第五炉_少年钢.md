    The Chongqing Iron and Steel Company smelted a furnace of "Young Pioneers' Steel" on the 27th for the children of Chongqing as a gift for the "June 1st" Children's Day.
    This is already the fifth furnace of "Young Pioneers' Steel" smelted by several steel plants in Chongqing.
    The children of Chongqing have collected a lot of scrap iron and steel in their spare time and handed it over to the state. The steel plants use the same amount of steelmaking raw materials as these scrap iron and steel to smelt "Young Pioneers' Steel". Since the first furnace of "Young Pioneers' Steel" was smelted in March this year, the scrap iron and steel collected by the children of Chongqing has increased from more than 200,000 jin to more than 430,000 jin.

    第五炉“少年钢”
    重庆钢铁公司二十七日给重庆市少年儿童炼了一炉“少年钢”，作为庆祝“六一”儿童节的礼物。
    这已经是重庆市几个钢铁厂炼出的第五炉“少年钢”了。
    重庆市的少年儿童在课余时间拾了许多废钢铁交给国家，钢铁厂就利用和这些废钢铁同等数量的炼钢原料炼出“少年钢”。从今年三月份第一炉“少年钢”炼出后到现在，重庆市少年儿童拾的废钢铁已经由二十多万斤增加到四十三万多斤。
