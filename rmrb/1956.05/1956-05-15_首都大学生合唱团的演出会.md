    Capital University Student Choir Performance

    On May 13th, the Capital University Student Choir, composed of 900 students from higher education institutions in the capital, held a performance at the Beijing Institute of Geology to report to fellow students on the choir's achievements since its establishment.

    This is the first university student choir established in our country last year. When the choir was first established, it only had one mixed choir. Later, it gradually expanded and established a male choir, a female choir, and a folk song team, becoming a student amateur singing group of more than 900 people.

    The report performance was a great success. The songs they sang were rich in content and diverse in form. Modern songs included "Youth Shock Brigade" and "Youth's Steed is Galloping," which expressed the youth's strength and joyful mood, and the very vivid and witty "When the Grapes are Ripe"; there were also folk songs from various parts of China and songs from the Soviet Union and Bulgaria.

    The Beijing University Teachers' Choir, which was established not long ago, and the student choirs of Beijing Institute of Geology and Beijing Railway Institute also participated in the performance.

    首都大学生合唱团的演出会
    五月十三日，首都高等院校九百人组成的大学生合唱团，在北京地质学院举行演出会，向同学们汇报合唱团成立以来的活动成绩。
    这是我国在去年才成立的第一个大学生合唱团。合唱团刚建立时，只有一个混声合唱队，以后陆续扩大和建立了男声合唱队、女声合唱队，以及民歌队，成为一支有九百多人的学生业余歌咏队伍。
    汇报演出会获得了很大的成功。他们演唱的歌曲内容丰富，形式多样。现代歌曲中有表现青年健壮有力和欢快情绪的“青年突击队”、“青年的骏马在飞奔”，有非常生动、俏皮的“葡萄熟了的时候”；还有我国各地民歌和苏联、保加利亚的歌曲。
    刚成立不久的北京市大学教师合唱团，和北京地质学院、北京铁道学院的学生合唱队，也参加演出。
