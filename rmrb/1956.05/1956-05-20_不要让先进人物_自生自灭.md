To the Editor:

    Zhang Xiuying, a female weaving worker at the Qingdao No. 5 State-Owned Cotton Mill, had outstanding production achievements in 1952. Both her output and quality were higher than other weaving workers, so she was selected as a labor model in Qingdao. In the following two years, she was repeatedly named a model worker. However, since last year, Zhang Xiuying's production performance has gradually declined, and she often fails to fully complete the monthly production plan. In the first four months of this year, she has not completed the planned targets even once. Naturally, she cannot be selected as a labor model anymore.

    Why did Zhang Xiuying change from an advanced figure in production to a worker who often fails to complete her plan? The main reason is that she encountered some bureaucrats—just as Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out at the National Conference of Advanced Producers: "They are only satisfied with giving advanced producers award banners, writing interviews, and allowing advanced producers to be representatives of this or that kind, but they rarely earnestly create conditions for advanced producers to continuously move forward..." After Zhang Xiuying was selected as a labor model in Qingdao in 1952, she was admitted to the Chinese Communist Party in the first half of 1953, became a representative of the people of Shandong Province and Qingdao City in the second half of the year, and participated in the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to comfort the troops. Later, she also attended the National Labor Model Conference of the Textile Industry. Last year, the factory Party Committee, disregarding the disagreement of Party members and the masses, forcibly "promoted" Zhang Xiuying to become a member of the Party Committee (she has already been voted out this year). Because Zhang Xiuying's level of awareness was not high enough, and the leadership did not provide her with good political and ideological education after she became a labor model, this gradually caused her to develop arrogance and complacency. She always believed that her work methods were the best and did not conscientiously implement the advanced 1951 weaving work method. At the same time, because she often attended various meetings and was away from production for a long time, she became unfamiliar with the operation methods and machinery when she returned to her machine. Therefore, her production performance gradually declined, and she could no longer maintain advanced indicators.

    After the workshop Party organization discovered that Zhang Xiuying had developed arrogance and complacency, they only talked to her lightly and did not seriously point out her shortcomings, nor did they specifically help her overcome these shortcomings. After the opinions were raised, it was considered acceptable if she did not change.

    Now Zhang Xiuying herself feels very distressed, but she does not know what causes her to be unable to complete the production targets and no longer be an advanced figure. The leaders of the workshop Party, government, and trade union have not seriously analyzed the objective conditions and subjective reasons that caused this situation, nor have they tried to help her catch up.

    I believe that the Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Qingdao Federation of Trade Unions should urge the Qingdao No. 5 State-Owned Cotton Mill to improve its work in cultivating and educating advanced individuals. Other industrial and mining enterprises should also learn from this lesson and not let advanced individuals "perish on their own."

### 不要让先进人物“自生自灭”

    不要让先进人物“自生自灭”编辑同志：
    国营青岛第五棉纺织厂织布女工张秀英，在1952年生产成绩很突出，产量、质量都比其他织布工人高，因此被选为青岛市的劳动模范。接着两年，她又连续被评为模范。但是，从去年起，张秀英的生产成绩逐渐下降了，常常不能全面完成每月的生产计划；今年四个月来，一次也没有完成计划指标。劳动模范当然也就选不上了。
    为什么张秀英会从一个生产上的先进人物变成一个经常不能完成计划的工人呢？主要原因是她遇着这样一些官僚主义者——正如刘少奇同志在全国先进生产者代表大会上所指出的：“他们只满足于给先进生产者发奖旗，写访问记，满足于让先进生产者当这种或那种代表，但是他们很少认真地为先进生产者创造条件，使之不断前进……。”张秀英在1952年当选为青岛市劳动模范后，1953年上半年被吸收加入了中国共产党，下半年成为山东省和青岛市的人民代表，并参加了中国人民赴朝慰问团去过朝鲜，以后又出席了全国纺织工业劳动模范会议。去年，厂党委会不顾党员群众的不同意，又把张秀英硬“提拔”成为党委委员（今年已落选）。因为张秀英本来觉悟程度不够高，成为劳动模范以后领导方面又没有很好地对她进行政治思想教育，这就使得她逐步滋长了骄傲自满情绪。她总认为自己的工作方法最好，对先进的1951织布工作法不认真执行。同时，由于她经常出席各种会议，脱离生产的日子长了，再去看车，对操作方法和机器都不熟悉了，因此，生产成绩逐步下降，不能再保持先进的指标了。
    车间党组织发现张秀英滋长了骄傲自满情绪以后，只是和她轻描淡写地谈了谈话，没有严肃地指出她的缺点，并且具体帮助她克服这些缺点。意见提过以后，她不改也就算了。
    现在张秀英自己感到很苦恼，但是她不知道究竟是什么原因使她不能完成生产指标，不能再成为先进人物。车间党、政、工会领导方面也没有认真分析过造成这种情况的客观条件和主观原因，设法帮助她赶上去。
    我认为，中共青岛市委和青岛市工会联合会要督促国营青岛第五棉纺织厂改进培养和教育先进人物的工作。其他工矿企业也应该吸取这个教训，不要让先进人物“自生自灭”。纪若云
