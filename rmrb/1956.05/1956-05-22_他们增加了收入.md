The Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing has developed a variety of sideline productions. From December of last year to early May of this year, the cooperative's income from sideline productions such as quarrying, tofu making, and transportation was more than 140,000 yuan. The income from other sideline productions such as dairy cows, sheep farms, pig farms, and flour mills is not yet included. Of this money, more than 80,000 yuan was invested in agriculture and sideline industries, more than 20,000 yuan was deposited in the credit cooperative, and 40,000 yuan was distributed to the members in mid-April.

The Sino-Soviet Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative is located near the famous Babaoshan in Beijing. Babaoshan is indeed a veritable treasure mountain. The bluestone, yellow slurry soil, blue ash, red soil, red sand, dry soil, sand, and gravel on the mountain, after simple processing, become blue ash, yellow slurry, and whitewash for painting houses. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Cooperative made full use of this natural condition and developed the sideline production of quarrying, which required little investment and yielded high returns. After the merger of four small cooperatives into a large cooperative of 1,500 households in December last year, the cooperative's management committee arranged agricultural production and organized a portion of the surplus labor force to mine the treasures of Babaoshan – sand, gravel, ash, and soil. This sideline production alone is expected to increase the cooperative's income by nearly 200,000 yuan this year. In addition, the cooperative has five other sideline productions, including flour mills, tofu workshops, transportation, pig farms, and dairy and sheep farms. It is estimated that the cooperative's income from various sidelines will account for more than 34% of the cooperative's total income this year. It is estimated that each household will receive an average of 700 yuan this year, an increase of nearly 200 yuan compared to last year.

The Sino-Soviet Friendship Cooperative distributed the sideline income in a timely manner, and the members were all happy. Cooperative member An Dong was especially happy. When he was working individually last year, he had to borrow grain from one neighbor and livestock from another. Now that he has joined the cooperative, he not only doesn't have to worry about farming, but he also doesn't have to worry about cooking and eating. This time, he received 31 yuan in advance distribution, enough for him and his wife to eat, dress, and have pocket money. Cooperative member Liu Shufang was on the field, chopping grass while chatting and laughing with others about the 58 yuan his family received this time. He said, "After receiving the money, I first bought 400 jin of lime to renovate the house. I also bought 50 chi of cloth to make clothes for my son and daughter-in-law, and I also bought coal and saved some pocket money." As he spoke, he laughed heartily. In the blink of an eye, a pile of chopped grass had accumulated beside him. These days, the Babaoshan Township Central Store in Lugou Village has become very lively. In the second half of April alone, they bought more than 3,500 chi of various colored fabrics, twice as much as in the first half of the month. Many cooperative members also came to the city to buy their favorite printed fabrics and other daily necessities.

This advance distribution was based on the amount of labor points each person had earned (four fen per labor point). Therefore, it greatly encouraged the members' enthusiasm for labor. The Fifth Production Team originally planned to water 400 mu of wheat in seven days, but they completed the task in five days. Cooperative member Chen Fulin is a strong young man, but he used to be a lazybones who worked for three days and rested for four. After this advance distribution, he not only did not absent himself, but also earned at least eight labor points every day.

The Sino-Soviet Friendship Cooperative did not borrow a penny from banks or credit cooperatives this year, but this spring the cooperative invested more than 80,000 yuan in agricultural and sideline production, all of which came from sideline income. The cooperative had sufficient preparations for seeds, pesticides, chemical fertilizers, and agricultural implements such as mats and sacks needed for the summer harvest. They also used this money to build a flour mill, a large orchard of more than 400 mu, and two pig farms, raising more than 500 pigs. They also expanded investment in vegetable production, ensuring the supply of feed for more than 450 livestock, and built fifty or sixty livestock sheds. However, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Cooperative also had some waste in financial expenditures. This was mainly due to the large expenses of the motor vehicle team and automobiles, and too many full-time and semi-full-time cadres. Since the initial implementation of the directive to run the cooperative diligently and frugally in April, the motor vehicle team has implemented a financial contract system, saving nearly 400 yuan per month for the entire cooperative's 179 motor vehicles, a reduction of one-third compared to past expenditures. Automobile drivers also proposed plans to save gasoline and increase income. The number of full-time personnel was also appropriately reduced, and methods for full-time cadres to participate in production were also discussed. Each production team also established a financial planning system and made monthly expense budget plans, changing the chaotic situation of each team asking for things temporarily and buying things randomly in the past.

    他们增加了收入
    陈一超
    北京郊区中苏友好农业生产合作社开展了多种多样的副业生产。从去年十二月到今年五月上旬，全社在开山挖土、做豆腐、运输等项副业生产收入了十四万多元，其他奶牛、羊场、猪场、粉房等副业生产的收入还没有计算在内。这笔钱，除了在农、副业上投资了八万多元，存入信用合作社两万多元外，在四月中旬，拿出四万元预分给社员。
    中苏友好农业生产合作社靠近北京有名的八宝山。八宝山确是一个名符其实的宝山，山上的青石、黄浆土、青灰、红土、红砂、干土、沙石等等，开采出来经过简单的加工以后，就成了粉刷房屋的青灰、黄浆、大白。中苏友好社充分利用了这个自然条件，开展了花钱少收入多的开山挖土的副业生产。从去年十二月由四个小社合并成一千五百户的大社以后，社管理委员会安排好了农业生产，就把一部分剩余劳动力组织去开采八宝山的宝物——砂石、灰、土。仅这一项副业生产今年就可给社里增加将近二十万元的收入。另外，社里还有粉房、豆腐房、运输、猪场及奶牛、羊场等五项副业生产，预计全社今年各项副业收入将占全社总收入的34％以上。估计今年每户平均可分得七百元，比去年增加将近二百元。
    中苏友好社及时预分了副业收入，社员们个个高兴。社员安栋更是高兴。去年他单干时，不是到东家借粮，就是到西家借牲口。现在入了社，不仅种地不用愁，就是烧、吃也不用愁了。这次预分，他分得了三十一元，他们老俩口有吃有穿，还有零用钱。社员刘树芳在场上，一面铡草，一面和别人有说有笑地谈论着他家这次分得五十八元钱的事情。他说：“分得了钱，我首先买了四百斤石灰，把房屋修整一新。又买了五十尺布，给儿子、媳妇做了单衣，还买了烧煤，留了零用钱。”他说着说着就哈哈大笑起来。一转眼，他身旁已堆起了一堆铡好的草。这些天，在鲁谷村里的八宝山乡中心商店可热闹起来了，他们在四月下半月光买各种花色的布就有三千五百多尺，比上半月增加了二倍，还有许多社员到城里来买他们喜爱的花布和其他日用品。
    这次预分是按照每人已得的劳动工分多少（每工分四分钱）分配的。因此大大鼓舞了社员的劳动热情。第五生产队原计划四百亩小麦七天浇完水，结果五天就完成了任务。社员陈福林是一个身强力壮的小伙子，但是他过去是干三天，歇四天的懒汉。经过这次预分后，他不但不缺勤，每天最少也能作八个工分。
    中苏友好社今年没有向银行、信用社贷一文钱，但是今年春天社里在农、副业生产方面投资了八万多元，这全是靠副业的收入。社里所需的种籽、农药械、化学肥料和夏收需要的席、麻袋等农具都有了充分准备。他们还利用这笔钱建立了一个粉房，一个四百多亩地的大果园，还建立了两个猪场，喂了五百多头猪。又扩大了蔬菜生产的投资，保证了四百五十多头牲口的饲料供应，又盖了五、六十间的牲口棚。但是中苏友好社在财务开支上也还有浪费。这主要是大车队、汽车等项开支较大，脱产半脱产的干部太多，自从四月份初步贯彻执行了勤俭办社指示以后，大车队实行了财务包干制，全社一百七十九辆大车每月可节约近四百元，比过去开支减少了三分之一。汽车司机也提出节省汽油、增加收入的计划、脱产人员也适当减少，并且还讨论了脱产干部参加生产的办法，各生产队也建立了财务计划制度、按月作开支预算计划，改变了过去各队临时要东西临时乱买的混乱情况。
