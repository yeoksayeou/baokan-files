    Mengjin Reservoir, the largest reservoir in Xinjiang, has been completed and expanded, and a water release ceremony was held on May 4th. After Saifuddin, Third Secretary of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Party Committee and Chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Committee, cut the ribbon, the reservoir gate was raised, and the surging water flowed from the "August 1st" and "Mengjin" canals into the farmland of the production and construction corps and farmers of all ethnic groups.
    Mengjin Reservoir is located in Miquan County. It was built in 1952 by the Urumqi Reclamation Area Production Corps. Expansion began last year. After the expansion, it can store 60 million cubic meters of water, which is twenty times larger than the original storage capacity. It can irrigate 260,000 mu of farmland. In addition to ensuring water supply for the Urumqi Reclamation Area Production Corps, it can also solve the water use problems of farmers of all ethnic groups downstream of the reservoir during the dry season.

    猛进水库扩建后开始放水
    新疆最大的水库——猛进水库已经扩建完工，五月四日举行了放水典礼。中共新疆维吾尔自治区党委第三书记、自治区人民委员会主席赛福鼎剪彩以后，水库闸门升起，滔滔大水便从“八一”、“猛进”水渠流入部队农场和各族农民的农田。
    猛进水库修建在米泉县，1952年由乌鲁木齐垦区生产部队修成，从去年开始扩建，扩建以后可以蓄水六千万立方，比原来蓄水量扩大了二十倍，可以灌溉农田二十六万亩，除保证乌鲁木齐垦区生产部队用水以外，还可以解决水库下游各族农民在枯水期的用水问题。　（新疆生产战线报）
