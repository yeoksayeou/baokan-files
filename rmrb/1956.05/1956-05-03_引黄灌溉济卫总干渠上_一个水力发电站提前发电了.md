    On the Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Jiwei Main Canal
    A Hydroelectric Power Station Generates Electricity Ahead of Schedule
    The No. 3 Drop Hydroelectric Power Station on the Henan Province Yellow River Diversion Irrigation Jiwei Main Canal began generating electricity on May 1st. That night, the farmers of Xiaoji and Xingning villages in Xinxiang County saw electric lights and were overjoyed. The entire project of this hydroelectric power station was originally scheduled to be completed and generate electricity on July 1st of this year. Encouraged by the enthusiasm for welcoming the "May Day" International Labor Day, the workers and masses generated electricity two months ahead of schedule with creative labor. In addition to supplying electricity for eight pumping stations to irrigate 55,030 mu of high land, the electricity from this power station can also provide lighting for farmers in ten townships and twenty-nine villages.

    引黄灌溉济卫总干渠上
    一个水力发电站提前发电了
    河南省引黄灌溉济卫总干渠三号跌水水力发电站于五月一日开始发电。当天夜里，新乡县的小冀和兴宁两个村的农民们看到了电灯，欢欣若狂。这座水力发电站的整个工程原计划在今年七月一日建成发电，由于职工群众在迎接“五一”国际劳动节的热情鼓舞下，以创造性的劳动提前两个月发电了。这座发电站的电力除供八个抽水机站浇高地55，030亩用电外，还能供十个乡二十九个村的农民照明用电。（本报驻郑州记者）
