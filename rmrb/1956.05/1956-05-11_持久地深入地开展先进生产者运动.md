    Persistently and Deeply Carry Out the Advanced Producer Movement

    The National Conference of Advanced Producers Representatives has concluded victoriously. The advanced producer representatives who attended the meeting returned to their posts with an important task. This task is: to advance, advance, and advance again, continuously, to reach higher levels of production; and together with those advanced producers who did not attend the meeting, and together with the broad masses, to transform the advanced levels they have reached rapidly into the production levels of all workers, and to carry out the advanced producer movement more persistently and deeply.

    To accomplish this task, advanced producers must make great efforts. Advanced producers should not only maintain and consolidate the advanced levels they have already achieved, but also continue to advance on this basis. Because things are developing, people are progressing, what is advanced today may not be advanced tomorrow, and if you do not continue to advance, you will inevitably fall behind. Of course, it is far from enough for advanced producers to simply make themselves constantly advance. Advanced producers should also take the initiative to sincerely and earnestly help other comrades, pass on their experiences to them, so that they can also reach advanced levels. The result of this kind of help will be to improve the production technology level of the entire work type and the entire enterprise. By extension, it will eventually promote the development of the entire national economy. This kind of help also has another result, which is what many advanced producers have personally experienced, that when they help their comrades, they can also be enlightened and helped by the other party. Every ordinary producer may have some strengths worth learning from; and advanced producers are not and cannot be perfect, and they have some shortcomings that also need the help of others. This kind of mutual assistance, mutual learning, learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses, in order to achieve common improvement of comradely relations, correctly embodies the basic principles of socialist competition. We must implement this principle well in carrying out the advanced producer movement.

    Among the broad masses of ordinary producers, a trend of striving to learn from advanced producers has begun to take shape, which is very good. However, there are also a few people who have a mentality of muddling along, being content with backwardness, and not being willing to learn, which should be overcome. The advanced experience of advanced producers is the crystallization of people's labor and the wealth of all the people, and it is worth learning from. The diligent and responsible attitude of advanced producers towards labor, and the humble, prudent, and tenacious spirit of learning, are especially worth emulating. The extraordinary heroic deeds of advanced producers are all created in ordinary labor. Every ordinary producer should have this confidence: as long as we can study diligently, we will definitely be able to reach the production level that advanced producers can reach. Anyone who strives to learn advanced experience will definitely receive the practical support of the Party, administrative, and trade union organizations.

    In order to carry out the advanced producer movement persistently and deeply, production leaders bear a heavy responsibility. What is the urgent task of production leaders at present? It is to seize the important link of summarizing advanced experience and promoting advanced experience, and take practical and specific technical and organizational measures to create good conditions for advanced producers to impart their experience and for ordinary producers to learn advanced experience, so as to ensure that the advanced producer movement develops universally and persistently. Many leading organs have already begun to do this, and the Ministry of Railways is one of them. The nineteen professional bureaus of the Ministry of Railways, with the assistance of the Railway Trade Union, have formulated this year's plan for promoting advanced experience based on the 203 major advanced experiences exchanged at the National Railway Advanced Producers Representatives Conference. Among them, the Vehicle Bureau plans to promote the experience of the Harbin Train Overhaul Plant, so that the pass rate of freight cars will reach 100%, and the number of vehicles repaired by shunting will be reduced by 30% compared with 1955. In order to ensure the realization of these indicators, they have also formulated specific technical and organizational measures. The Vehicle Affairs Bureau and other eight bureaus alone have stipulated that they will hold seven national advanced experience training classes, twenty-eight demonstration performances, and two national exhibitions, etc. The practice of the Ministry of Railways is worth promoting. Of course, formulating a plan is only the beginning of the matter. To realize these plans, it is also necessary for the masses to actively participate from the bottom up, and for the leadership to rely on the masses and contact the masses to carry out a series of arduous and meticulous organizational and ideological work.

    However, at present, there are still many leading comrades in some units who still keep the advanced producer movement in the state of advocating proposals, issuing calls, holding conferences, and making resolutions. This is a formalistic style of work that only catches the wave and does not engage in practical work. This is unacceptable. In the eyes of these leaders, the experience of advanced producers is very good, the enthusiasm of the masses is very high, and all the leaders have to do is to praise it and express their support, and advanced experience will naturally be promoted. This is not correct. Advanced producers urgently require the support of the leadership, but not verbal or written support, but the support of actual actions. Promoting the experience of advanced producers is essentially a struggle between the new and the old, the positive and the negative, the advanced and the backward. Without strong leadership, without the close combination of the leadership with the masses, especially with the advanced producers, the promotion of advanced experience is impossible, and it is also impossible to insist that the experience can be mastered by all workers.

    Adopting advanced experience and advanced technology in production will cause major changes in labor organization and production technology, and will affect a series of changes in the relationship between units within the enterprise, between enterprises, between supply, production, and sales, and in cooperative relationships. Predicting these changes, fully estimating and using all the possibilities that actually exist, in order to raise production to a new level that can be achieved, is a very complex and meticulous work that requires realistic leadership. We must not only oppose the negative tendency of emphasizing this and that difficulty and defending one's own right-leaning conservative thinking; but also oppose the tendency of going beyond actual possibilities and doing things that cannot be done in reality, which is divorced from reality. Because this will also bring losses to production, will dampen the enthusiasm of the masses, and is not conducive to the advanced producer movement.

    In order to carry out the advanced producer movement persistently and deeply, it is also necessary to implement the socialist principle of material encouragement and remuneration according to work. Improving labor productivity and improving the level of production technology are a fundamental guarantee for the victory of China's socialist construction cause. We should not only educate the masses to recognize this, but also promote the masses to care about this from the perspective of material interests. We must be able to make workers clearly realize the consistency of individual interests, collective interests, and national interests, and realize the close relationship between striving to continuously improve labor productivity and continuously improving their own lives in terms of wages, rewards, labor conditions, and collective welfare undertakings. To this end, we must do a good job in the current wage reform work and strengthen the labor and wage work of enterprises; we must continue to oppose the bureaucratic tendency of enterprise leaders who actually do not care about the lives of workers; we must strengthen mass supervision in this regard.

    After the conclusion of the National Conference of Advanced Producers Representatives, the advanced producer movement will inevitably have a new development. Party committees at all levels should, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee, resolutely rely on the backbone force of advanced producers, and through them, closely contact the masses, give full play to the role of enterprise administration, trade unions, and youth league organizations, realize their correct leadership over the movement, so that the advanced producer movement can be carried out more persistently and deeply, and greatly promote China's socialist construction cause.

### 持久地深入地开展先进生产者运动

    持久地深入地开展先进生产者运动
    全国先进生产者代表会议胜利结束了。出席会议的先进生产者代表带着一个重要的任务回到自己的岗位上去。这个任务就是：不断地前进，前进，再前进，使自己达到更高的生产水平；并且同那些没有出席会议的先进生产者一起，同广大群众一起，把自己所达到的先进水平，迅速地变为全体工人的生产水平，把先进生产者运动更加持久深入地开展下去。
    为了完成这个任务，先进生产者要作很大的努力。先进生产者不仅应该坚持和巩固已经达到的先进水平，并且还要在这个基础上不断前进。因为事物在发展，人们在进步，昨天是先进的，明天就可能不是先进的了，不继续前进，势必要落在后面。当然，先进生产者仅仅做到使自己不断前进那还是非常不够的。先进生产者还应该主动地诚心诚意地努力帮助别的同志，把自己的经验传授给他们，使他们也能够达到先进水平。这种帮助的结果，便会使整个工种、整个企业的生产技术水平得到提高。推而广之，最后便会推动整个国民经济的发展。这种帮助还有另外一种结果，这就是许多先进生产者亲身体会到的，当他们对自己的同志进行帮助的时候，还可以使自己得到对方的启发和帮助。每一个普通的生产者都可能有一些长处值得人们学习；而先进生产者不会也不可能是十全十美的，他们有一些短处也需要别人的帮助。这种互相帮助，互相学习，取长补短，以便达到共同提高的同志关系，正确地体现了社会主义竞赛的基本原则。我们在开展先进生产者运动中，必须很好地贯彻执行这个原则。
    在广大的普通生产者中间，已经开始树立起努力向先进生产者看齐的风气，这是很好的。不过，也有少数人存在着一种得过且过、安于落后的情绪和不虚心学习的现象，这是应该克服的。先进生产者的先进经验，是人们劳动的结晶，是全体人民的财富，值得大家好好学习。先进生产者勤恳负责地对待劳动的态度，谦虚、谨慎、顽强地进行学习的精神，尤其值得大家仿效。先进生产者们不平凡的英雄事迹，都是在平凡的劳动中创造出来的。每一个普通生产者，都应该有这样的信心：只要我们能够勤勤恳恳地学习，先进生产者能够达到的生产水平，我们一定也能够达到。任何人努力学习先进经验的行动，是一定会得到党、行政和工会组织的实际支持的。
    为了把先进生产者运动持久地深入地开展下去，生产领导者担负着重大的责任。当前生产领导者的迫切任务是什么呢？就是要抓紧总结先进经验和推广先进经验这一重要环节，采取切合实际的具体的技术组织措施，为先进生产者传授自己的经验和为普通生产者学习先进经验创造良好的条件，以便保证先进生产者运动普遍地持久地发展下去。许多领导机关已经开始这样做了，铁道部就是其中的一个。铁道部十九个专业局，在铁路工会的协助下，根据全国铁路先进生产者代表会议上交流的203种主要先进经验，分别制定了今年的推广先进经验的规划。其中车辆局计划推广哈尔滨列车检修所的经验，使货车合格率达到百分之百，使甩车修理的车辆比1955年减少30％。为了保证实现这些指标，他们还制定了具体的技术组织措施。仅车务等八个局就规定要举办七次全路性的先进经验训练班，二十八次示范表演，两次全国性的展览等。像铁道部这种做法是值得提倡的。当然，制定出规划仅仅是事情的开始，要实现这些规划，还需要群众自下而上的积极参加，还需要领导上依靠群众、联系群众，进行一系列的艰巨细致的组织工作和思想工作。
    但是，目前还有不少单位的领导同志仍然把先进生产者运动停留在提倡议，发号召，开大会，做决议的状态中。这是一种只赶浪头不务实际的形式主义作风。这是要不得的。在这些领导者们看来，先进生产者的经验很好，群众的热情很高，领导者要做的只是赞扬一番，表示支持就够了，先进经验自然就会推广了。这是不正确的。先进生产者迫切要求领导上的支持，但不是口头上或纸面上的支持，而是实际行动的支持。推广先进生产者的经验，实质上是新与旧、积极与消极、先进与落后的斗争。没有坚强的领导，没有领导同群众首先是同先进生产者的紧密结合，先进经验的推广是不可能的，推广了，能够坚持成为全体工人都能掌握的经验，也是不可能的。
    在生产中采用先进经验，采用先进技术，将要引起劳动组织上、生产技术上的重大改变，将要影响企业内部各单位之间，企业与企业之间，供、产、销之间以及协作关系的一系列的变化。预见到这些变化，充分估计和运用实际存在着的一切可能性，以便把生产提高到可能达到的新的水平，这是一种非常复杂细致的工作，需要实事求是的领导。我们既要反对强调这样那样的困难，为自己的右倾保守思想辩护的那种消极倾向；也要反对超越实际可能，去做那些实在做不到的事情的那种脱离实际的倾向。因为这同样会给生产带来损失，会挫伤群众的热情，对先进生产者运动不利。
    为了把先进生产者运动持久深入地开展下去，还必须贯彻物质鼓励和按劳取酬的社会主义原则。提高劳动生产率，提高生产技术水平，是我国社会主义建设事业胜利的一个根本保证。我们不仅要教育群众认识这一点，而且应该从物质利益上促使群众关心这一点，我们必须在工资奖励制度上，在劳动条件上，在集体福利事业上，都能让工人清楚地体会到个人利益、集体利益和国家利益的一致性，体会到争取不断提高劳动生产率同不断改善自己生活的密切关系。为此，必须做好当前的工资改革工作，加强企业的劳动工资工作；必须继续反对在企业领导者中实际存在的不关心工人生活的官僚主义倾向；必须加强这方面的群众监督。
    全国先进生产者代表会议闭幕之后，先进生产者运动必然有一个新的发展。各级党委应该根据中央的指示，坚决依靠先进生产者这支骨干力量，通过他们去紧密联系群众，充分发挥企业行政、工会、青年团组织的作用，实现自己对运动的正确领导，使先进生产者运动更加持久地深入地开展下去，把我国社会主义建设事业大大地推向前进。
