    "The Dawn" Collective Farm and its Chairman Orlovsky
    By Li He, Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union
    Spring arrived late this year. Belarusians call April "Krasavik," meaning the beautiful season of red flowers and green grass. However, in early April, when I passed through Minsk and arrived at the "Dawn" Collective Farm, 170 kilometers southeast of it, the multi-marshy fields of the Belarusian Republic were still covered with a layer of snow, and cotton-like snowflakes danced in the wind.
    The first spring of the Sixth Five-Year Plan period was anxiously awaited. Mounds of fertilizer, like long walls, had already been piled up in the vast fields of the "Dawn" Collective Farm. The people of this collective farm, like agricultural laborers all over the Soviet Union, had made all preparations for spring plowing, and despite the delayed weather, they had no doubt that they would achieve decisive results this year.
    Striving to Reach the 1960 Production Level Within One Year
    "'Dawn' Collective Farm is embarking on a new era of development in 1956!" This was the first sentence that Kirill Prokofievich Orlovsky, the chairman of the farm, said to me when we met at the farm's management office. His smiling voice was full of confidence. He explained why he used the word "era." He said, "The 20th Congress of the CPSU opened this era. The 20th Congress of the CPSU inspired us, infused us with new strength, and urged us to rush forward. The members' congress decided to reach the 1960 production level in two years, and even strive to reach it in one year."
    After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, a new upsurge emerged in Soviet agricultural labor. Many agricultural laborers, across entire farms, districts, and states, made guarantees to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. But for a collective farm like "Dawn," which grew up from postwar ruins and not-so-good land, it is particularly remarkable to realize such a grand ambition in such a short period.
    The members of "Dawn" Collective Farm guarantee that in 1956, on the more than 2,000 hectares of grain-producing land, they will produce 1.5 tons per hectare; on the 900 hectares of potato-producing land, they will produce 18 tons per hectare; on the 700 hectares of flax, they will produce 0.6 tons of fiber and 0.5 tons of seeds per hectare; the 700 dairy cows will each produce 4,000 liters of milk; and every 100 hectares of arable land will produce 6 tons of pork (a total of 2,000 pigs). This is close to their planned 1960 production level last year. (At that time, the plan was the same for flax and pork, 1.8 tons for grain, and 4,500 liters for milk). They are striving to reach this level as much as possible. This level is much higher than in 1955 -- the grain yield per hectare will be increased by more than half, the milk yield per cow will be increased by more than 1,000 liters, and the pork production per 100 hectares of arable land will be increased by about 2 tons. Orlovsky said, "The task is great, but it is noble; the task is difficult, but it can be accomplished."
    How to accomplish it? From conversations with Orlovsky and Lev Yakovlevich Gorelik, the agronomist of the collective farm, I understood that this mainly relies on the constantly growing enthusiasm of collective farmers over the past three years, especially after the 20th Congress of the CPSU. Taking fertilization as an example, "Dawn" Collective Farm has 9,000 hectares of land, including 5,529 hectares of arable land. The amount of fertilizer applied has increased year by year over the past three years: about 100,000 tons in 1954, 120,000 tons in 1955, and 140,000 tons in 1956. When the supply of barnyard manure is insufficient, a large amount of inexhaustible peat from local ponds is used as fertilizer. Under the active management of the collective farmers, the sandy loam and gray soil here have also changed their barren characteristics.
    The adjustment of purchasing and procurement prices of agricultural products, the change in the method of formulating agricultural plans, the new collective farm charter, and the adoption of new work quotas are of decisive significance for improving the production enthusiasm of collective farmers.
    In the past, procurement prices were set too low, which damaged the production interests of collective farmers. Since the September 1953 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, the prices of agricultural products, especially procurement prices, have been reasonably adjusted many times. This year, the state has again increased the purchasing and procurement prices of vegetables and potatoes by a large margin. This naturally greatly stimulates people's interest in growing vegetables and potatoes. "Dawn" Collective Farm harvested more than 14,000 tons of potatoes in 1955, which is an important source of income for the farm. Orlovsky told me that the state had just transferred 100 tons of potatoes from the farm as seeds, and will return 200 tons to the farm in the autumn, which is beneficial to both the state and the farm.
    The method of collective farms formulating their own agricultural plans has reversed the past situation where plans were prescribed from above, which limited the initiative of collective farmers. Orlovsky cited two facts. The land of "Dawn" Collective Farm is not suitable for growing spring wheat, and the harvests have been very low for ten years. The members have repeatedly proved that more winter wheat should be planted, but without results. After the autumn of 1954, the farm was finally able to decide for itself to expand the planting of winter wheat and winter rye to more than 2,000 hectares, and only plant a very small amount of spring wheat, barley, and oats, thus harvesting more than 2,700 tons of grain in 1955, with the yield per hectare increasing by one or two times. The land of "Dawn" Collective Farm is suitable for growing flax. After accumulating two years of experience, 500 hectares of flax were planted in 1953. The district authorities blamed it for violating the plan, forcing it to reduce the planting area of this highly profitable industrial crop in 1954. In 1955, it formulated its own plan and planted 700 hectares of flax, resulting in an income of 10 million rubles, accounting for more than half of its cash income.
    Taking advantage of the gap before spring plowing, "Dawn" Collective Farm drew up a new charter. They were formulated based on the spirit of the recent decisions of the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR Council of Ministers on collective farms and the farm's own experience. The new charter emphasizes the need to further develop the collective farm's public economy as much as possible. This collective farm has 1,300 households. In the past, each household was allocated 0.6 hectares of private plot, but now the private plot has been reduced to 0.3 hectares. Each member household is still allowed to raise one cow, one sow, and unlimited poultry, but the number of beehives raised has been reduced from twenty to ten. This allows members to put more effort into developing the public economy. The remuneration for each work day of this collective farm, if converted into cash, is as high as 80 rubles. Therefore, investing more labor in the public economy will greatly increase the benefits not only for the farm but also for the members. According to the new charter, the decisions of the collective farm members' congress on expelling members, reducing the area of private plots, and other matters cannot be overturned by the district Soviet Executive Committee if it disagrees, but can only be submitted to the members' congress again for reconsideration and decision. This greatly enhances the role of the members' congress and the sense of responsibility of the members. "Dawn" Collective Farm has 4,000 residents, scattered in many villages. It is inconvenient to hold regular members' congresses. In the past, it often happened that each production team held meetings separately, and then the resolutions of each meeting were compiled into one resolution. The new charter stipulates that the conference of plenipotentiary representatives elected by the members has the same power as the general meeting of all members. Therefore, some matters can be handed over to the conference of plenipotentiary representatives of hundreds of people for discussion and resolution.
    The new quota is a new phenomenon in the current life of Soviet collective farmers, comparable to the new charter. "Dawn" Collective Farm wants to increase labor productivity by 20%. Without the new quota, this is unimaginable. According to the new quota, the amount of work for each work day has been increased. To get paid for one work day, a member must work diligently for five or six hours. In this way, the collective farm can complete a higher amount of work with less labor days.
    In the enthusiasm of collective farmers, which is like the earth reviving in spring, we see the abundant potential for further development of "Dawn" Collective Farm and the entire Soviet agriculture.
    Tireless and Persistent Communists
    "Dawn" Collective Farm deserves to be a model collective farm in the Soviet Union. It has a strong and diversified economy. It has 150 public buildings including livestock barns, warehouses, and other buildings. Its cash income reached 18 million rubles in 1955. In 1955, it paid each work day with three kilograms of grain, ten kilograms of potatoes, one kilogram of vegetables, and thirty rubles in cash. The Nikolai Dudchenko family, with four laborers, worked a total of 1,450 work days in 1955, and received 4,586 kilograms of grain, 14,414 kilograms of potatoes, 1,474 kilograms of vegetables, and 43,500 rubles in cash. Every member's house has electric lights, radios, and fully furnished houses. All of this was reborn and thrived from the ruins of nothing after the war. Communist Orlovsky played an important role in leading the farm to achieve these achievements.
    At the 20th Congress of the CPSU, Comrade Khrushchev praised Orlovsky, who was unwilling to live a leisurely life on pensions and preferred to continue working like a battle, as an "example of a true communist patriot." Orlovsky was on the representative seat at the time. After the closing of the Party Congress, Orlovsky immediately returned to Belarus to convey the spirit of the Party Congress. He told me, "The collective leadership of the Party Central Committee is encouraging. This is the correct leadership of Leninism. The tasks of the Sixth Five-Year Plan are very great, but they will definitely be completed ahead of schedule. Because the people spare no effort to complete it ahead of schedule."
    Orlovsky was very excited when talking about the Party Congress. His eyes flashed with agility, and his face seemed to be covered with a layer of radiance. If it weren't for his whitening temples, he might not be believed to be over sixty years old. If it weren't for the empty right sleeve and the outstretched left wrist shaking hands with people, he might not be believed to be a disabled veteran who had suffered serious injuries. People want to know the history of this Communist who has made outstanding contributions on the battlefield and on the farm. Orlovsky briefly told me about his life.
    Orlovsky is the son of a local farmer. He became a Communist in 1918. During the Soviet Civil War, he served as a guerrilla captain and reconnaissance captain. In 1937, he volunteered to participate in the anti-fascist battles of the Spanish International Brigade. When the Soviet Patriotic War began, he was on a business trip in Xinjiang, China. After voluntarily requesting, he rushed back to the enemy-occupied area of Belarus and led guerrillas to conduct activities. In 1943, his right arm and left hand were shot in a battle, with blood flowing like a torrent and causing unbearable pain. He gritted his teeth and commanded the battle to the end. This battle cost him his right arm and the fingers of his left hand. But his heroism earned him the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. The state gave this retired lieutenant colonel a comfortable residence in Moscow, and he was also qualified to receive a generous pension, which he could spend the rest of his years with his family in respect. However, as a Communist, he was unwilling to live on pensions, unwilling to leave labor. He went to the Party's State Committee and asked for a combat work position. He was willing to invest his own efforts in the economic construction of the revitalized Belarusian Republic. He was recommended as the chairman of the collective farm in his hometown.
    This disabled veteran left Moscow in 1944 and came to his destination. At that time, the war was still on the front line, and the destroyed hometown was still desolate. The difficulties were numerous. His wife was unwilling to leave Moscow and come with him. He had to divorce his wife. This was not the main thing. He was unfamiliar with agriculture, although he had worked in the fields with his father in his childhood, and worked and studied at the Chkalov Agricultural College before the Patriotic War. Everything had to be learned from scratch, and he was already fifty years old at this time. He said, "I didn't have any experience in leading a collective farm at that time. I had to work and learn to work." He stepped up reading agricultural books, went to many model state farms and collective farms to learn the art of leading a large economy, and paid attention to the experience of advanced collective farms published in newspapers and periodicals. This is his "agricultural university". He realized in learning and practice that the most important thing is to attract people to work consciously and actively. He said: "A collective farm chairman cannot do much if he does not rely on Communists and activists, and if he does not rely on the members."
    When he first became the chairman of the collective farm, Orlovsky visited the "Karavaevo" State Farm, where he participated in the production meeting. This state farm holds a production meeting every morning before starting work to solve urgent production problems. He used this experience in the "Dawn" Collective Farm. People who have visited this collective farm for eleven years have seen that a half-hour production meeting is held every morning (before sunrise in summer) at the management office. The members call it "collective talk". Participants include members of the management committee and production team leaders, directors of livestock farms, repair shops, garages, and warehouses, accountants, and representatives of ordinary members. At the meeting, the work of the previous day is briefly summarized, the tasks for the day are put forward, criticisms and discussions are launched, and decisions are made. Experience has proved that this "collective talk" is very beneficial. It not only helps the farm's leadership staff to grasp the situation and solve problems in a timely manner, but also puts the daily affairs of the collective farm under public supervision (major matters are passed through the members' congress). At first, 15 to 20 people participated in the "collective talk", but now it has expanded to 60 to 80 people. Because there are no lengthy and empty speeches, the large number of people does not hinder the talk.
    The "Dawn" Collective Farm Management Committee led by Orlovsky used to have only nine members, but now it has twenty-nine members. According to the new charter, it will have thirty-five members, including the responsible personnel of various production departments and ordinary members. When the management committee is in meeting, it always invites ordinary members to participate. They also actively put forward opinions. These all show attention to widely absorbing activists to participate in the work of the management committee.
    Loyalty to the cause of communism and tireless and persistent practice and learning have enabled Orlovsky to quickly become an outstanding collective farm chairman. He has shown his talents in several key matters. Like other collective farms that have suffered war disasters, "Dawn" Collective Farm once received a loan of nearly 500,000 rubles from the state. Sixty fine breed heifer calves and two bulls were bought. A truck was bought to transport wood and bricks for building cowsheds, and the most capable female members were selected as milkers. Succulent feed was prepared for the cattle. Soon, highly profitable milk began to be produced. And a large number of onions, cucumbers, and cabbages were planted. Nearly one million rubles were earned from vegetables. In this way, the initial financial difficulties were resolved, and the economic foundation for revitalization was laid. "Dawn" Collective Farm did not seriously raise pigs in the first few years of its establishment, and sold piglets too early, so the income from pig raising was very low. Later, this mistake was corrected. The number of pigs raised has been constantly increasing in the past five years, and the income from pig raising in 1949 was only 20,000 rubles, but exceeded 2 million rubles in 1955. "Dawn" Collective Farm originally did not grow flax, but now it grows flax on large tracts of land and achieves high yields, which has opened up a broad new source for the collective farm's economic prosperity.
    Under the leadership of Orlovsky, "Dawn" Collective Farm has changed from backward to advanced. Orlovsky has not slackened off because of this. He still participates in the "collective talk" every morning, and still plans to further develop the collective farm at all times. He told me: "'Dawn' Collective Farm will continue to improve production, educate people to work honestly and love labor every day, and will become an agricultural commune in eight years."
    This year, the members of two villages will move to new homes in the central village. There will be a canteen, bakery, bathhouse, laundry, school, and kindergarten. This will be the beginning of the construction of an agricultural city. "Dawn" Collective Farm, as pursued by Orlovsky and all members, is moving towards communism.

    “曙光”集体农庄和它的主席奥尔洛夫斯基
    本报驻苏联记者  李何
    今年春天姗姗来迟。白俄罗斯人把四月叫做“克拉沙维克”，意思是花红草绿的美丽时节。但是，四月初旬，当我经过明斯克到达在它东南一百七十公里的“曙光”集体农庄的时候，白俄罗斯共和国的多池沼的田野上还铺盖着一层积雪，棉絮大小的雪花随风飞舞着。
    第六个五年计划时期的第一个春天令人等得心焦。“曙光”集体农庄的广阔田野上已经垒好一堆堆长墙似的肥料。这个集体农庄的人们，和苏联各地农业劳动者一样，已经作好春耕的一切准备，而且尽管气候的延迟，一点也不怀疑在今年将取得决定意义的成就。
    争取一年内达到1960年的生产水平
    “‘曙光’集体农庄在1956年走上它的发展的新纪元！”这是农庄主席基里尔·普罗克非维奇·奥尔洛夫斯基在农庄管理处和我见面时候说的第一句话。在他含笑的声音里充满着自信。他解释为什么借用“纪元”这个字眼。他说：“是苏共第二十次代表大会开辟了这个纪元。苏共第二十次代表大会鼓舞着我们，向我们灌注着新的力量，促使我们向前飞奔。庄员大会决定在两年内甚至争取在一年内达到1960年的生产水平。”
    在苏共第二十次代表大会以后，苏联农业劳动中涌现出新的高潮。许多农业劳动者整庄、整区、整州地提出保证，要提前完成五年计划。但是像“曙光”这样在战后废墟和不算好的土地上成长起来的集体农庄，要在这样短促的期间内实现这样宏大的志愿，是特别难得的。
    “曙光”集体农庄庄员们保证：在1956年二千多公顷谷物产地上每公顷要产十五公担，九百公顷马铃薯产地上每公顷要产一百八十公担，七百公顷亚麻每公顷要产六公担纤维和五公担种子，七百头母牛每头要产四千公升牛奶，每一百公顷耕地要产六十公担猪肉（共养二千头猪）。这接近于他们去年计划的1960年的生产水平。（当时计划，亚麻、猪肉的产量同上，谷物十八公担，牛奶四千五百公升）。他们争取尽可能达到这个水平。这个水平比1955年高得多，——每公顷谷物产量要提高半倍以上，每头母牛产奶量要增加一千公升以上，每一百公顷耕地要增产约二十公担猪肉。奥尔洛夫斯基说：“任务很大，但这是崇高的；任务很难，但是能够完成的。”
    怎样完成呢？从和奥尔洛夫斯基以及集体农庄农艺师列夫·亚科夫列维奇·哥列里克的谈话中，我理解到这主要依靠三年来，特别是苏共第二十次代表大会后不断增长的集体农民生产积极性。以施肥为例，“曙光”集体农庄有九千公顷土地，包括5，529公顷耕地，这三年来施的肥料一年比一年多：1954年约十万吨，1955年十二万吨，1956年十四万吨。厩肥不够，大量利用当地池沼里的取之不竭的泥炭当肥料。在集体农民的积极经营下，这里沙壤灰壤的土地也改变了自己的贫瘠特性。
    对于提高集体农民的生产积极性有决定意义的，是农产品采购和收购价格的调整，农业计划制定办法的改变，新的集体农庄章程和新的工作定额的采用。
    过去收购价格定得过低，因而损害了集体农民的生产兴趣。自从1953年苏共中央九月全会以后，农产品价格特别是收购价格经过了多次合理的调整。今年国家又把蔬菜和马铃薯的采购和收购价格提高了许多。这自然大大刺激了人们种蔬菜和马铃薯的兴趣。“曙光”集体农庄1955年收获了一万四千多吨马铃薯，它是农庄一笔重要收入。奥尔洛夫斯基告诉我：国家刚才从农庄那里调走一百吨马铃薯作种籽，到秋天将还给农庄二百吨，这对于国家和农庄都有利。
    由集体农庄自己制定农业计划的办法，扭转了过去由上面规定计划，使集体农民的主动性受到限制的情况。奥尔洛夫斯基举了两件事实。“曙光”集体农庄的土地不宜种春小麦，十年中收成都非常低。庄员们一再证明应该多种冬麦，但是没有结果。到1954年秋天以后，农庄才有了可能自己决定把冬小麦和冬黑麦扩种到两千多公顷，只种极少量春小麦、大麦和燕麦，因而在1955年打了两千七百多吨谷物，每公顷产量提高一两倍。“曙光”集体农庄的土地宜种亚麻。累积了两年经验以后，在1953年种了五百公顷亚麻。区机关责备它违反计划，使它在1954年不得不缩小这种收入极高的技术作物的播种面积。1955年由它自己制定计划，种了七百公顷亚麻，结果收入了一千万卢布，占它的现金收入的半数以上。
    利用春耕前的空隙，“曙光”集体农庄订出了新章程。它们是根据苏共中央和苏联部长会议最近关于集体农庄的决议的精神和这个集体农庄自己的经验制定的。新章程着重指出要尽量进一步发展集体农庄的公有经济。这个集体农庄有一千三百户。以前分给每户0.6公顷宅旁园地，现在把宅旁园地缩减为0.3公顷。每户庄员仍然允许养一头母牛、一头母猪和无限制的家禽，但是养的蜂从二十箱减为十箱。这样使庄员把更多的力量放在发展公有经济上来。这个集体农庄的每个劳动日的报酬，都折成现金的话，高达八十卢布。所以向公有经济多投一分劳动量不但对农庄而且对庄员都会增加很大好处。根据新章程，集体农庄庄员大会关于开除庄员、减少宅旁园地的面积和其他的决定，区苏维埃执行委员会如果不同意，不能取消，只能再交庄员大会重新考虑和决定。这样大大提高庄员大会的作用和庄员的责任感。“曙光”集体农庄有四千居民，分散在许多村子，定期召开庄员大会是不方便的。过去常常有由各个生产队分头开会，然后把各个决议汇编成一个决议的情形。新章程规定，由庄员选出的全权代表会议和全体庄员大会具有同样的权力。所以有些事情可以交给几百人的全权代表会议去讨论解决。
    新定额是目前苏联集体农民生活中和新章程相媲美的新气象。“曙光”集体农庄要提高劳动生产率20％。没有新定额，这是不可想像的。按照新定额，每一个劳动日的工作量提高了，一个庄员要取得一个劳动日的报酬，必须殷勤地工作五、六个小时。这样，集体农庄付出较少的劳动日而可以完成更高的工作量。
    在像春天复苏的大地一样的集体农民的积极性中，我们看到了“曙光”集体农庄和整个苏联农业的进一步发展的充沛的潜力。
    不懈不怠的共产党员
    “曙光”集体农庄不愧是苏联的一个模范集体农庄。它拥有雄厚的多种经济。它盖有畜厩、仓库和其他一百五十座公有建筑物。它的现金收入在1955年已经达到一千八百万卢布。它在1955年给予每个劳动日的报酬是三公斤谷物、十公斤马铃薯、一公斤蔬菜、三十卢布现金。庄员尼古莱·杜德钦科一家有四个劳动力，在1955年共工作了一千四百五十个劳动日，得到了四千五百八十六公斤谷物，一万四千四百十四公斤马铃薯，一千四百七十四公斤蔬菜和四万三千五百卢布现金。庄员家家都有电灯、收音机、家具齐全的房屋。这一切都是战后从一无所有的废墟中再生和兴旺起来的。共产党员奥尔洛夫斯基在领导农庄取得这些成就中起了重要的作用。
    在苏共第二十次代表大会上，赫鲁晓夫同志表扬了这位不愿靠抚恤金过悠闲生活而宁愿继续战斗般工作的奥尔洛夫斯基，称他为“真正的共产党员爱国主义者的榜样”。奥尔洛夫斯基当时就在代表席上。在党代表大会闭幕以后，奥尔洛夫斯基立即回到白俄罗斯传达党代表大会的精神。他对我说：“党中央的集体领导令人鼓舞。这是列宁主义的正确领导。第六个五年计划的任务非常大，但是一定会提前完成。因为人民不惜一切力量提前完成它。”
    奥尔洛夫斯基谈到党代表大会时很兴奋。他的眼睛闪着敏捷的光芒，他的脸孔好像蒙上一层光彩。如果没有发白的两鬓，他也许不会被相信是六十开外的人了。如果不是右袖空着和伸出左腕和人家握手，他也许不会被相信是受过重伤的残废军人。对于这位在战场上和农场上都有出色贡献的共产党员，人们都想知道他的历史。奥尔洛夫斯基对我简短地谈了自己的生平。
    奥尔洛夫斯基是当地农民的儿子。1918年成为共产党员。在苏联国内战争时期，他当过游击队长和侦察队长。1937年志愿参加了西班牙国际纵队的反法西斯战斗。苏联卫国战争开始时，他出差在我国的新疆。经过自动请求，他赶回白俄罗斯的敌占区，率领游击队进行活动。1943年，有一次在战斗中他的右臂和左手都中了弹，血流如注，痛得难以支持。他咬紧牙根把战斗指挥到底。这次战斗使他失掉右臂和左手的指头。但他的英勇使他获得了苏联英雄的称号。国家在莫斯科给了这位退伍的中校舒适的住宅，而他也有资格领到一笔优厚的抚恤金，可以和家庭一起受人尊敬地度过余年。但是，作为一个共产党员，他不愿意靠抚恤金过活，不愿意离开劳动。他到党的州委会去，要求一个战斗的工作岗位。他愿意在复兴白俄罗斯共和国的经济建设中投进自己的心血。他被推荐为他的故乡的集体农庄的主席。
    这位残废军人在1944年离开莫斯科来到自己的目的地。当时战争还在前线进行，被毁的故乡还是一片荒凉。困难是重重的。他的妻子不愿离开莫斯科跟他来。他不得不和妻子离异。这还不要紧。他对于农业是生疏的，虽然童年时跟他父亲下过地，卫国战争前在契卡洛夫农学院工作和学习过。一切必须从头学起，而这时他已经五十岁了。他说：“我当时还没有领导集体农庄工作的经验。必须工作和学习工作。”他加紧阅读农业书籍，到许多模范的国营农场和集体农庄学习领导大经济的艺术，注意报刊上登载的先进集体农庄的经验。这就是他的“农业大学”。他在学习和实践中体会到了，最重要的是吸引人们自觉地积极工作，他说：“一个集体农庄主席要是不依靠共产党员和积极分子，要是不依靠庄员们，那是做不了好多事情的。”
    在初当集体农庄主席的时候，奥尔洛夫斯基访问过“卡拉瓦耶沃”国营农场，在那里参加了生产会议。这个国营农场每天早晨在开始工作之前举行生产会议，解决迫切生产问题。他把这个经验用到“曙光”集体农庄来。十一年来到过这个集体农庄的人们都见到，每天早晨（夏天在日出之前）在管理处举行半小时的生产会议。庄员们叫它做“集体的谈话”。参加的有管理委员会委员和生产队长，养畜场、修理场、车房和库房的主任，会计和普通庄员的代表。在会议上，简单地总结昨天的工作，提出当天的任务，展开批评和讨论，作出决定。经验证明，这种“集体的谈话”非常有益。它不但帮助农庄的领导工作人员及时地掌握情况和解决问题，而且使集体农庄里的日常事情也放在公众的监督之下（重大事情经过庄员大会）。起初，参加“集体的谈话”的有十五到二十人，现在扩大到六十到八十人。因为不作冗长的空泛的发言，所以人多并不妨碍谈话。
    由奥尔洛夫斯基领导的“曙光”集体农庄管理委员会过去只有九个委员，现在有二十九个委员，按照新章程将有三十五个委员，包括各个生产部门的负责人员和普通庄员。管理委员会在开会时候，总是邀请普通庄员们参加。他们也积极地提出意见。这些都说明对于广泛地吸收积极分子参加管理委员会工作的注意。
    对共产主义事业的忠心和不倦不馁的实践和学习，使奥尔洛夫斯基很快成为出色的集体农庄主席。他在几个关键性的事情上面显示了自己的才干。像其他受过战争灾难的集体农庄一样，“曙光”集体农庄曾经得到国家差不多五十万卢布的贷款。买了六十头良种母犊和两头公牛。买了一辆载重卡车来运输盖牛舍用的木材和砖块，挑选了最能干的女庄员当挤奶员。给牛准备了多汁饲料。很快就开始出产收入很高的牛奶。并且种了大量葱、黄瓜、白菜。从蔬菜收入近百万卢布。这样，解除了初期的财政困难，打下了复兴的经济基础。“曙光”集体农庄在才立定脚跟的头几年没有认真地养猪，太早卖掉猪仔，所以养猪的收入很低。后来改正了这个错误。这五年来养的猪不断增加，养猪的收入在1949年不过二万卢布，1955年超过二百万卢布。“曙光”集体农庄原来不种亚麻，现在在大块土地上种亚麻并且取得高产量，这为集体农庄的经济繁荣开辟了广阔的新源泉。
    “曙光”集体农庄在奥尔洛夫斯基的领导下已经从落后的变为先进的。奥尔洛夫斯基没有因此懈怠。他还是每天清早参加“集体的谈话”，还是时时刻刻筹划进一步发展集体农庄。他对我说：“‘曙光’集体农庄不断提高生产，每天教育人们诚实工作和爱好劳动，在八年以后将变为农业公社。”
    今年将有两个村子的庄员移到中心村的新居。那里将出现食堂、面包房、澡堂、洗衣坊、学校、幼儿园。这将是农业城市的建筑的开始。“曙光”集体农庄，像奥尔洛夫斯基和全体庄员所追求的，正在向共产主义前进。
