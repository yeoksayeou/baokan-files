Yinchuan Special District, Gansu Province, which has a history of more than 2,000 years of Yellow River irrigation, has completed this year's spring canal repair project as scheduled. The first round of irrigation for summer crops is three to four days earlier than in previous years.

This year's canal spring repair project was completed in a race against time and a fight against rain and snow. From March 29th to April 27th, more than 40,000 laborers on the hundreds of miles of spring repair project frontline launched a labor competition, promoted systems such as the "joint tamping method" and "section piecework contracting," which increased work efficiency by 24% to 50%. Finally, on the premise of ensuring the quality of the project, it was completed on schedule, preparing the conditions for early water release. This year, the area irrigated by Yinchuan Special District is larger than the total area expanded since liberation six years ago. Therefore, early water release and seizing the time for irrigation are of great significance for ensuring this year's agricultural production increase.

    银川专区完成渠道春修工程
    有两千多年引黄灌溉历史的甘肃省银川专区，今年的渠道春修工程已经如期完成了。夏季作物头轮灌水工作较往年提前三、四天。
    今年的渠道春修工程是在和时间赛跑、同雨雪斗争中紧张完成的。从三月二十九日到四月二十七日，在数百里的春修工程战线上，四万多个民工展开了劳动竞赛，推行了“联合打夯法”和“段落计件包工”等制度，使工作效率提高24％到50％。终于在保证工程质量的前提下，按期完工，为提前放水准备了条件。今年，银川专区扩大灌溉的面积比解放六年以来扩大灌溉面积的总和还要多。因此，提前放水，抓紧时间进行灌溉，对保证今年的农业增产有着重要意义。
