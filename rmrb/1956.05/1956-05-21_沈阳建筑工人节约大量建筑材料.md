Shenyang construction site workers have achieved success in saving building materials. By the end of April, workers at construction sites throughout the city had saved more than 1,200 tons of cement, 165 tons of steel, and more than 500 cubic meters of wood for the country.

In the competition to save building materials at various construction sites, workers and engineering technicians jointly researched and proposed many rationalization suggestions for saving materials. Whenever an important suggestion for saving materials was implemented, many construction sites immediately sent people to visit and learn from it. Twenty-one important advanced experiences in saving cement, steel, and wood have been widely promoted at various construction sites. The No. 3 Engineering Office of the Northeast Second Engineering Company, which is responsible for the Shenyang Wire Factory and other major construction sites, has saved more than 300 tons of cement and 83 tons of steel in the first four months of this year by implementing several advanced experiences such as dry-hard concrete, steam-pulled steel bars, and plasticizer concrete. Luo Yonghua, an employee of Shenyang No. 3 Engineering Company, researched a new method of concrete mix design that can save 30 kilograms of cement per cubic meter of concrete.

The No. 3 Engineering Office of the Northeast Second Engineering Company also paid attention to processing many old steel bar ends left over from past construction into iron wire for use, saving more than eight tons of steel. Meng Xian, a purchasing agent from another engineering company, proposed replacing cement pipes with pottery pipes, which, after implementation, can save 40 tons of cement.

    沈阳建筑工人节约大量建筑材料
    沈阳市建筑工地上的工人在节约建筑材料方面获得了成就。到四月底止，全市建筑工地的工人为国家节约了一千二百多吨水泥，165吨钢材，五百多立方公尺木材。
    各建筑工地上的工人在节约建筑材料的竞赛中，工人和工程技术人员共同研究出许多节约材料的合理化建议。每当一项节约材料的重要建议实现以后，许多工地立刻就派人前去参观学习。各个建筑工地上，普遍推广了二十一种节约水泥、钢材、木材的重要先进经验。东北第二工程公司第三工程处所承担的沈阳电线厂等两大工地，推行干硬性混凝土、汽拉钢筋、塑化剂混凝土等几项先进经验以后，今年头四个月中节约了三百多吨水泥，节约了八十三吨钢筋。沈阳市第三工程公司职员罗永华研究的一种混凝土配合新方法，可以使每立方公尺的混凝土节省三十公斤水泥。
    东北第二工程公司第三工程处还注意把过去施工剩下的许多旧钢筋头，加工成铁线使用，节约了八吨多钢材。另一工程公司的采购员孟宪，提出用陶泥管代替水泥管的建议实现以后，可以节省四十吨水泥。
