Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 24th: The All-Indonesia Student Congress issued a communiqué on May 19th stating that the resolutions of the Bandung Conference held last year should serve as the basis for the upcoming Asian-African Student Conference.

The communiqué stated that Asian and African students should engage in sincere, earnest, and voluntary cooperation based on mutual understanding, mutual respect, mutual benefit, and equality. This cooperation must be free of any discrimination, must oppose colonialism, and must not favor the views of one side.

The communiqué stated that the Asian-African Student Conference should be a broad gathering, unaffected by any political trends.

The communiqué was issued at the conclusion of the All-Indonesia Student Congress, which was convened to discuss matters pertaining to the Asian-African Student Conference scheduled to be held in Bandung at the end of May, and to elect the Indonesian delegation to attend the conference.

    全印度尼西亚学生会议发表公报说
    万隆会议决议是亚非学生会议的基础
    新华社雅加达24日电　全印度尼西亚学生会议五月十九日发表公报说，去年举行的万隆会议的决议应当作为即将召开的亚非学生会议的基础。
    公报说，亚非学生应当以相互谅解、相互尊重、互利与平等为基础而进行真挚、诚恳和自愿的合作。这种合作必须没有任何歧视，必须反对殖民主义并且不偏袒一方的观点。
    公报说，亚非学生会议应当是广泛的集会，它不受任何政治趋势的影响。
    这个公报是全印度尼西亚学生会议结束时发表的，召开这次会议是为了讨论预定在五月底在万隆召开的亚非学生会议的问题，并且选出出席这次会议的印度尼西亚代表团。
