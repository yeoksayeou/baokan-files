    An Effective Traditional Chinese Medicine Formula for Treating Schistosomiasis Under Research
    Gao Changren
    In the Schistosomiasis Prevention and Treatment Center of Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province, traditional Chinese medicine doctor Wang Dinghuan is using his researched traditional Chinese medicine Jiajian Weiling Decoction and Jiangfan Pill mixture to treat the first batch of thirty-one patients with advanced schistosomiasis. According to the analysis of twenty-two cases that have already completed or are nearing completion of treatment by mid-March, the patients' ascites quickly disappeared within ten days of taking the medicine; the spleens of the original sixteen patients with splenomegaly significantly contracted after taking the medicine; five of the eight patients who had distended veins upon admission have now recovered; and the eggs in the stool of nine patients have been tested and changed from positive to negative. The traditional Chinese medicine formula researched by Wang Dinghuan has attracted attention from all sides. The Yuanjiang County Schistosomiasis Prevention and Treatment Center has sent the treatment summary of these twenty-two cases to the Office of the Central Committee's Nine-Person Leading Group for Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control for review and research. Their experimental treatment work is still being carried out intensively.
    Doctor Wang Dinghuan is from Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province, one of the areas severely affected by schistosomiasis. During his youth when he was studying medicine, he knew that schistosomiasis was a serious disease, but at that time, both traditional Chinese and Western medicine doctors in Yuanjiang County were helpless against this disease. In 1947, during his research, Wang Dinghuan realized that schistosomiasis was related to internal organs such as the liver and spleen, and that treating this disease required treating the enlargement and hardening of the liver and spleen in addition to eliminating ascites. From then on, he began to research a Jiajian Weiling Decoction from traditional Chinese medicines that treat the liver and spleen. In order to help patients eliminate ascites more quickly, he also tried to make a Jiangfan Pill. He wanted to use these two prescriptions together to cure schistosomiasis.
    In the process of his research, this Jiangfan Pill caused him great difficulties. He knew that Jiangfan and Croton seeds were highly irritating and could easily irritate the esophagus, making it difficult for patients to swallow. Initially, he wrapped the medicine in lychee pulp for the patient to swallow, but it didn't work; later, he bought capsules from a pharmacy to wrap the medicine for the patient to swallow, but it was still very irritating, causing nausea and vomiting. Finally, he mixed these two medicines with rice and made pills, which unexpectedly succeeded. Because the pills made in this way were easy for patients to swallow, they were digested slowly in the stomach, were not very irritating, and the medicinal effect could be fully exerted. Since 1949, he has used this prescription to cure many patients. The most significant example was in this year when he cured the late-stage schistosomiasis of farmer Mao Xueyou. At that time, Mao Xueyou's abdomen was as swollen as a drum, making it difficult even to breathe. He had not been cured in several hospitals, and his life was already in danger. His family took a boat to Wang Dinghuan's clinic from more than thirty miles away for a last chance. Wang Dinghuan saw that the patient's condition was very serious and was not sure he could cure him. At the request of the patient's family, he used his researched traditional Chinese medicine formula to treat Mao Xueyou.
    He first gave the patient Jiangfan pills, five pills on the first day (generally only three pills), but it was ineffective. He gave five pills again on the second day, but it was still ineffective. Wang Dinghuan was afraid that the patient would not be able to tolerate it, so he only gave him three pills on the third day. At this time, the patient's family had lost confidence in Wang Dinghuan's prescription and asked another traditional Chinese medicine doctor for a prescription. Before the person who bought the medicine returned, the patient began to vomit and diarrhea, and the excrement filled half a manure bucket. The patient's symptoms also lessened. On the fourth day, the patient could sit up, and on the fifth day, the ascites disappeared. Wang Dinghuan gave the patient ten doses of Jiajian Weiling Decoction to take home. Twenty days later, this patient, who was once in critical condition, was able to walk more than thirty miles to Yuanjiang to thank the doctor.
    After curing Mao Xueyou, Wang Dinghuan was full of confidence in his traditional Chinese medicine formula. Whether he was in private practice or working at the Yuanjiang County Health Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, he used this prescription to treat schistosomiasis.
    However, for several years, Wang Dinghuan's effective traditional Chinese medicine prescription for treating schistosomiasis did not attract people's attention in Yuanjiang County. Wang Dinghuan did not disclose his prescription to anyone. He had two concerns: one was that he was afraid that others would not believe him and say he was bragging; the other was that this was the result of his many years of research, and he was reluctant to tell others easily.
    In November 1955, Wang Dinghuan studied the relevant documents on traditional Chinese medicine policy and was very moved. Soon, the Yuanjiang County Schistosomiasis Prevention and Treatment Center established contact with traditional Chinese medicine doctors in Yuanjiang County and reviewed their past mistakes of despising the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, requesting cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine to work together to eliminate schistosomiasis. Under these circumstances, Wang Dinghuan further understood the policies of the Party and the government and sincerely appreciated the Party and the government's meticulous care for the health of the people. At a symposium, he excitedly announced his prescription and listed the significant cases of schistosomiasis he had cured over the years.
    The Yuanjiang County Schistosomiasis Prevention and Treatment Center paid close attention to this matter. After research, they believed that the prescription was not very toxic and was in line with medical principles, so they entrusted Doctor Wang Dinghuan to continue to observe the treatment effect of ten patients. According to preliminary summaries, the effect was very good. In order to further study this traditional Chinese medicine formula and summarize Wang Dinghuan's treatment experience, the prevention and treatment center allocated thirty-one hospitalized patients from February this year and hired Wang Dinghuan to be responsible for the treatment. The prevention and treatment center also allocated two Western medicine doctors, three nurses, and four laboratory personnel to assist Wang Dinghuan in his work, using scientific methods to test and summarize the therapeutic effect of traditional Chinese medicine. Now, the traditional Chinese and Western medicine doctors at the Yuanjiang County Schistosomiasis Prevention and Treatment Center are conducting further treatment experiments. The good results of the first batch of twenty-two cases have further strengthened Wang Dinghuan's confidence. When it was discovered that the eggs in the stool of nine patients had changed from positive to negative, all the traditional Chinese and Western medicine doctors in the center were very happy. They are now conducting specific analysis and experiments to study how to make this traditional Chinese medicine formula have the efficiency to kill adult worms in the body.

    一种治疗血吸虫病的有效中药方剂在研究中
    高长任
    在湖南省沅江县血吸虫病防治所里，中医师王定寰正在用他研究出来的中药加减胃苓汤和绛矾丸合剂，来治疗第一批三十一名晚期血吸虫病患者。据三月中旬已经结束治疗和接近完成治疗的二十二个病例分析，病人服药以后，在十几天内很快地消除了腹水；原来有十六个病人脾脏肿大，服药以后显著地收缩了；有八个病人入院的时候静脉怒张，现在已经有五个人复原；还有九个病人大便中的虫卵，经过检验，已经由阳性转为阴性。王定寰研究出来的这个中药方剂，已经引起各方面的重视。沅江县血吸虫病防治所已经把这二十二个病例的治疗总结，送到中共中央防治血吸虫病九人小组办公室审查研究。他们的试验治疗工作仍然在紧张地进行着。
    王定寰医师是沅江县人。沅江县是湖南省血吸虫病严重地区之一。他在青年学医时代，就知道血吸虫病是一种严重的疾病，可是当时沅江县的中医西医对这种病都是无可奈何。1947年，王定寰在研究当中，认识到血吸虫病和肝、脾等内脏都有关系，对这种病进行治疗，除了消除腹水以外，必须同时治疗肝、脾的肿大和硬化。从这时起，他就着手从治疗肝、脾的中药当中，研究出一种加减胃苓汤，为了使病人更快地消除腹水，他又试制成一种绛矾丸。他想用这两种处方配合起来，根治血吸虫病。
    在他进行研究的过程当中，这种绛矾丸曾经给他很大的困难。他知道绛矾和巴豆刺激性大，容易刺激食道，病人不易吞服。开始他用荔枝肉把药包起来，给病人吞下去，不行；以后又到西药房买胶囊把药包起来给病人吞服，但仍有很大的刺激性，引起病人恶心呕吐。最后，他把这两种药和米饭搅拌，做成丸子，这一次意外地成功了。因为这样做成的药丸，病人很容易吞下去，到胃里消化较慢，刺激性不大，药效也就能充分发挥了。从1949年起，他就用这个处方治愈了不少病人。最显著的一个例子，是在这一年他治愈了农民毛学佑的晚期血吸虫病。那时，毛学佑腹大如鼓，连呼吸都很困难，在几个医院都没有治好，生命已经很危险了。他的家属为了最后碰一碰运气，就用小船把病人从三十多里外送到王定寰的诊所里来医治。王定寰看到病人的病情十分严重，也没有把握。在病人家属的请求下，他就用他研究出来的中药方剂替毛学佑治病。
    他首先给病人服绛矾丸，第一天给他吃五粒（一般只吃三粒），没有效。第二天又吃五粒，仍然没有效。王定寰怕病人受不了，第三天只给他吃三粒。这时候，病人家属对王定寰的药方已经失去了信心，又找另外一个中医开了药方。谁知买药的人还没有回来，病人就开始上吐下泻了，排泄物足足装了半粪桶，病人的症状
  也跟着减轻。第四天，病人可以坐起来，第五天，腹水消除。王定寰又给病人十剂加减胃苓汤带回家去吃。二十天以后，这个一度生命危急的病人，已经能够自己走三十多里路跑到沅江来感谢医生了。
    在治愈毛学佑以后，王定寰对他的中药方剂，充满了信心。在他私人开业的时候也好，在沅江县健康中医院工作的时候也好，他都用这个处方来治疗血吸虫病。
    可是，几年以来，王定寰这个治疗血吸虫病的有效的中药处方，在沅江县并没有引起人们的注意。王定寰也没有对任何人公布他这个处方。他有两种疑虑：一是怕别人不相信，说他吹牛；二来因为这是自己多年研究来出的成果，也舍不得轻易告诉别人。
    1955年11月，王定寰学习了中医政策的有关文件，很受感动。不久，沅江县血吸虫病防治所又和沅江县的中医师建立了联系，并且检讨了过去他们轻视祖国医学遗产的错误，要求中西医合作，共同为消灭血吸虫病而努力。在这种情况下，王定寰进一步认识了党和政府的政策，衷心感激党和政府对人民的健康无微不至的关怀。在一次座谈会上，他激动地公布了他的处方，并列举了他几年来治愈血吸虫病的显著事例。
    沅江县血吸虫病防治所对这件事十分注意。经过研究，认为这个处方的毒性不大，也合乎医学原理，就委托王定寰医师继续观察十个病人的治疗效果。经初步总结，效果很好。为了进一步研究这个中药方剂，总结王定寰的治疗经验，从今年二月份起，防治所拨出三十一个住院病人，聘请王定寰到所里来负责医治。防治所还调配了两名西医、三名护士、四名化验人员协助王定寰工作，用科学方法来检验和总结中药的治疗效果。现在，沅江县血吸虫病防治所的中西医正在进一步作治疗试验。第一批治疗二十二个病例的良好结果，更坚定了王定寰的信心。当发现九个病人大便中的虫卵由阳性转为阴性的时候，全所的中西医都十分高兴。现在他们正在进行具体分析和试验，研究如何使这一中药方剂具有杀灭体内成虫的效率。
