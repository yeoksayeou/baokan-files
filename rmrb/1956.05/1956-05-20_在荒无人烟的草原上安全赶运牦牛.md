To the Editor:

Last August and September, on the desolate grasslands of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, a continuous stream of yaks appeared. Gannan Food Company employees, led by Gan Ziqing, drove 890 yaks, overcoming numerous difficulties, and safely arrived in Lanzhou. None of the yaks died or were injured during the journey, and they even gained over 600 jin in weight; feed costs were also saved by more than 3,300 yuan. This is an unprecedented new achievement in the yak transportation work of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.

In the past, the Gannan Food Company's route selection for transporting yaks was poor, and there was a lack of water and grass along the way, so the yaks did not eat and drink well, resulting in serious deaths and weight loss. Once, 177 yaks were transported, and more than half of them died or had to be slaughtered urgently on the road. Last July, the company sent Gan Ziqing and three others to cross the grassland and survey a new route where they could herd and graze the yaks while driving them. It was the rainy season on the Gannan grasslands. On the road, sometimes they couldn't find a house for days, and Gan Ziqing and others could only spend the night in the bushes; sometimes they encountered steep slopes and thick forests, and they had to use hoes and iron shovels to clear the way. In addition, Hou Qianyuan, who was familiar with the grassland roads, slipped away midway. However, with the assistance of Tibetan brothers, Gan Ziqing and others finally determined the 600-li transportation route as scheduled.

Soon, Gan Ziqing accepted the task of driving the yaks. Based on the lessons learned from the survey route, he conducted thorough ideological work with the workers in advance and jointly studied the driving system. Therefore, the workers were very enthusiastic, and no one deserted or complained along the way. When the cattle herd reached Heicuo and was crossing the river, a sudden hailstorm broke out; the cattle herd scattered and fled, and Gan Ziqing and the workers gathered the cattle herd back and forth on the Yong River until late at night before resting. When the cattle herd arrived at Kangle Diaotangou, the difficulties were even greater. The two gorges of Diaotangou were steep and tall, covered with dense forests, and the ditch water curved for more than 20 Chinese miles, requiring the cattle herd to cross back and forth more than 40 times. When they were about to leave the ditch, a sudden hailstorm and sleet began to fall, and the cattle herd scurried back and forth in the narrow ditch. Gan Ziqing and the workers, although cold, hungry, and tired, still chased the cattle herd everywhere, and only found the cattle herd back the next day. They adhered to the method of herding and grazing along the way, so that the cattle could eat well and rest well, as comfortable as grazing on the grassland. During the driving, the employees were also able to unite and help each other, ensuring the safety of the cattle herd.

After the yaks were safely transported to Lanzhou, the Provincial Food Company immediately gave Gan Ziqing and others material rewards. In March of this year, Gan Ziqing was selected as a first-class outstanding escort in the provincial food company system and attended the first Gansu Provincial Advanced Producers Conference.　Zhang Ruyun

### 在荒无人烟的草原上安全赶运牦牛

    在荒无人烟的草原上安全赶运牦牛编辑同志：
    去年八、九月间，在甘南藏族自治州荒无人烟的草原上，出现了一支绵延不绝的牦牛队伍。甘南食品公司职工甘子清等赶运着890头牦牛，克服了重重困难，安全地到达了兰州。这群牦牛在途中没有死伤，还增膘六百多斤；饲料费也节省了三千三百多元。这是甘南藏族自治州赶运牦牛工作中从未有过的新成绩。
    过去，甘南食品公司调运牦牛的路线选择得不好，沿途水草缺乏，牛吃喝不好，因此死亡、掉膘的现象很严重。有一次调运了177头牦牛，在路中死亡和急宰的就有一半以上。去年七月，公司派甘子清等四人穿过草原，勘查一条可以边赶边牧的新线路。当时正是甘南草原的多雨季节。在路上，有时候几天找不见人家，甘子清等只能在草丛中过夜；有时候遇上陡坡梢林，他们只好用镢头、铁铣开路。再加上熟悉草原道路的侯乾元在中途溜走了。但是，甘子清等在藏民兄弟的协助下，终于如期勘定了长达六百里的运输路线。
    不久，甘子清接受了赶运牦牛的任务。他根据勘查路线的教训，事前就向工人进行了充分的思想工作，并且共同研究了赶运制度。因此，工人们热情很高，途中就没有一个人掉队或喊苦。在牛群到达黑错正在渡河的时候，突然下起猛烈的雹子来；牛群四散奔逃，甘子清和工人一道在永河上来回吆集牛群，一直到深夜才休息。在牛群到康乐吊摊沟的时候，困难就更大了。吊摊沟两峡陡高，长满了丛密的梢林，长达二十几华里的沟水湾湾曲曲的，牛群要来回过四十几次。当快要出沟的时候，突然下起冰雹和雪雨来，牛群在狭长的沟里来回窜奔，甘子清和工人们虽然又冷又饿又累，但是还四处追赶牛群，一直到第二天天亮，才把牛群找了回来。他们在沿路坚持了边赶、边牧的办法，使牛都能吃好、休息得好，像在草原上放牧一样安适。在赶运中，职工们还能团结一致，互相帮助，保证了牛群的安全。
    在牦牛安全运达兰州后，省食品公司立即对甘子清等进行了物质奖励。今年三月，甘子清被选为省食品公司系统一等优秀押运员，并且出席了甘肃省首届先进生产者会议。　张汝芸
