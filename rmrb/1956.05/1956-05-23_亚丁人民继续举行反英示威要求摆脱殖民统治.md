    Xinhua News Agency, May 21st dispatch from Aden: In Aden, a British territory in the southeast of the Arabian Peninsula, demonstrations against British colonial rule continued on May 20th. As Lloyd, the Permanent Under-Secretary of the British Colonial Office, left Aden for Africa, hundreds of people waved their fists and shouted anti-British slogans.
    When Lloyd arrived in Aden on May 11th, Aden residents had already staged demonstrations chanting slogans such as "Down with colonialism."
    During Lloyd's stay in Aden, Aden's political leaders made demands to him for self-government and internal independence. However, on May 19th, Lloyd announced to the Aden Legislative Council that it was the firm intention of the British government to control the Aden colony. He said that due to Aden's strategic and economic importance in the British Commonwealth, the British government "cannot foresee any possibility of fundamentally relaxing their responsibilities."
    Lloyd's announcement of Britain's intention to continue maintaining its colonial rule over Aden has further aroused the indignation of the Aden people.
    Aden was occupied by Britain in 1839. In recent years, the Aden people's calls for breaking free from colonial rule have become increasingly louder.

    亚丁人民继续举行反英示威要求摆脱殖民统治
    新华社21日讯　亚丁消息：在阿拉伯半岛东南部的英国属地亚丁在五月二十日继续举行反对英国殖民统治的示威。当英国殖民部常务次官劳埃德离开亚丁前往非洲的时候，数以百计的群众挥舞着拳头，高呼反英口号。
    在劳埃德五月十一日到达亚丁的时候，亚丁居民就曾经高呼“打倒殖民主义”的口号举行了示威。
    劳埃德在亚丁期间，亚丁的政治领袖们曾经向他提出要实行自治和内政独立的要求。但是劳埃德五月十九日对亚丁立法议会宣布了控制亚丁殖民地是英国政府的坚定的意图。他说，由于亚丁在英联邦里的战略上和经济上的重要性，英国政府“不能预见任何根本放松他们的责任的可能性”。
    劳埃德宣布的英国企图继续维持它对亚丁的殖民统治的这种态度，进一步激起了亚丁人民的愤慨。
    亚丁是在1839年被英国占领的。最近几年来，亚丁人民要求摆脱殖民统治的呼声正越来越响亮。
