Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 25th. The complete set of tools needed to manufacture the first batch of domestically produced automobiles are mostly in the warehouse.

Among these tools, there are more than 20,000 types of special tools alone, divided into ten major categories: cutting tools, measuring tools, auxiliary tools, fixtures, cold heading tools, cold stamping dies, hot forging dies, die-casting dies, powered tools, and electric tools. Most of them are precision and complex new products that China could not manufacture in the past or has never manufactured before. The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant's tool workshops began trial-manufacturing and manufacturing these tools in February of last year, and so far about 13,000 types have been manufactured. Together with the part manufactured with Soviet assistance, most of these more than 20,000 tools have been successively put into the warehouse, and some have begun to supply the needs of various workshops for production.

Manufacturing automobiles also requires hundreds of types of standard tools and grinding wheels that are also used in general mechanical industries. These standard tools and grinding wheels were also manufactured for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant by factories across the country long ago.

    制造首批汽车的全套工具准备妥当
    新华社长春25日电　制造第一批国产汽车所需要的全套工具，绝大部分已经入库。
    这些工具中仅专用工具就有两万多种，分刃具、量具、辅具、夹具、冷镦工具、冷冲模、热锻模、压铸模、机动工具、电动工具等十大类，大部分都是我国过去不能制造或从来没有制造过的精密复杂的新产品。第一汽车制造厂各工具车间从去年二月份开始试制和制造这些工具，到现在有一万三千种左右已经制造出来。加上苏联帮助我国制造的部分，现在，这两万多种工具绝大部分都已经陆续入库，有的开始供应各个车间生产的需要。
    制造汽车还需要几百种一般机械工业中也使用的各种标准工具和砂轮。这些标准工具和砂轮也早由全国各工厂帮助第一汽车制造厂制造出来了。
