Moving Forward on the Basis of Victory
—A Record of the National Conference of Advanced Producers
By Our Correspondent

One delegate after another, amid applause, walked onto the stage. They faced over six thousand delegates, no, they faced the people of the whole country, reporting on their work. When they recounted what they had done in the past, their attitude was calm. They spoke of the breathtaking feats of venturing deep into the grasslands, climbing snowy peaks, exploring glaciers, and crossing the Nujiang River; they spoke of the unforgettable achievements of conducting hundreds of experiments and spending countless sleepless nights for a new product, a technological reform, or the progress of a project, all in such an ordinary way. When they talked about what they would do tomorrow, everyone was excited and also conscientious. They knew that what they were about to do was much more and much more difficult than what they had already done!

In the congratulatory speech by Comrade Liu Shaoqi, representative of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and in the speeches by responsible comrades of various government departments, the call was made to build our country into an advanced socialist industrial power. We must let steel factories produce more types of steel; we must let our own manufactured airplanes, automobiles, and tractors fly and run on the skies and lands of our motherland; we must let huge, new blast furnaces appear in many places; we must build dozens of dams on the Yellow River to block the turbulent currents, turn them clear, use them to generate electricity, and irrigate hundreds of millions of acres of fertile land; we must extend railways and highways to the most remote areas, and produce more, better, and cheaper light industrial products to make people live better; in that vast virgin forest, in the high mountains, barren lands, and deserts that no one has ever been to, treasures that have been sleeping for tens of thousands of years are waiting for geological exploration personnel to awaken them; large tracts of grassland are looking forward to tractor drivers day and night. And how many more great and glorious things do we need to accomplish!

This unprecedented conference was a review, a review of the wisdom and strength of our working class, and it was also a mobilization, mobilizing all advanced producers and the people of the whole country to accomplish the great cause of making ourselves and our descendants live a happy life. The delegates made such a pledge: "In this glorious era, we will constantly strive to fulfill the tasks assigned to us by the Party and the people." In this pledge, in the speeches at the conference, in group discussions, and in individual conversations, one could perceive an inspiring force that was motivating everyone. The noble qualities of the workers are the source of this force. It makes one believe that we will certainly be able to win new victories on the basis of victory.

Our workers are such people: they are infinitely loyal to the country's construction cause, they are full of a conscious sense of responsibility in every small job, and they closely link their actions with the prosperity and happiness of the country. Isn't Li Xueyi such a person? Once, their team was assigned the task of pouring fifty-seven concrete pillars in a key project. After the first pillar was poured, it was found that the quality was not good and the work could not continue. The days of freezing were approaching day by day, and the workers were anxious day and night, and Li Xueyi could not sleep either. One night, at more than three o'clock in the morning, it suddenly rained heavily. Li Xueyi grabbed a shirt and ran to the construction site, covering the fifty or sixty bags of cement placed in the open with mats. On this windy and rainy night, on this deserted construction site, he thought of the broken pillar and couldn't help but walk over, put his hand into the formwork, touched the cold mortar and stones, stayed for a long time, reluctant to leave, with thousands of thoughts in his mind: How can we guarantee the quality? He left the construction site dejectedly. He walked, thinking, forgetting the wind, rain, cold, and fatigue. Suddenly, a stream of water poured down on him, and he shivered. He raised his head and, through the dim light, found that rainwater was flowing down from the "water spout" on the eaves. He was moved, and stood in the rain, pondering. Inspired by the "water spout," he and everyone studied a tool, solved the quality problem, and completed the construction plan ten days ahead of schedule.

There are many, many such people and such things. When the design drawings were sent to the construction site at the beginning of the construction of the Yingxia Railway, the construction unit was supposed to follow the drawings. However, could the line be shortened, could the span and diameter of bridges and culverts be reduced? Wang Zhisui, Hua Yunzhang, Tang Chuyuan and many others inspected the natural conditions of many catchment areas, investigated how large and how fast the rivers were flowing. They traveled back and forth on some lines and proposed a plan to modify the design, saving 102 million yuan, which played a huge role in ensuring that the Yingxia Railway was opened to traffic one year ahead of schedule. If they hadn't been so consciously dealing with the country's construction, who could blame them!

This loyalty, this consciousness, this seamless unity with the interests of the country, has enabled us to overcome many, many difficulties; thousands of people have tempered themselves and grown up in the struggle against difficulties, always holding high the banner of victory. Everyone still remembers that in the difficult years after the war, molten iron solidified in the blast furnace, machines stopped running, and weeds grew in the factory buildings. Our workers said: "We must revive all this," and this determination was quickly realized. In the days when planned economic construction began, pouring such large foundations, installing such complex machines, and producing such precise products were all very unfamiliar to us. Our workers said: "Learn it! Master it!" This determination was also quickly realized. On the road to future construction, what difficulties can stop us from moving forward?

Our workers are such people: they can help others with enthusiasm, catch up with themselves, and regard all the advanced experience they have created as the wealth of the whole people. Lin Ruiting, a carpentry team leader from Sichuan, has never stopped spreading advanced experience. However, when he learned advanced experience from others in Wuhan and returned fully loaded, he felt not only happy, but also ashamed: when he taught others, did others also return fully loaded? Now it seems that this is not the case. Often his team completed the task ahead of schedule, while other teams held back the project. He thought: We should teach others better. Even if a person is made of iron, how many nails can he make? If the efficiency of workers across the country is doubled, how significant would that be! Later, their team used various methods in six months to help eight teams of 104 workers reach an advanced level. They were not satisfied, and this year they made a plan to help 388 people in 26 teams exceed the national quota by 20%.

In every factory, on every construction site, such deeds emerge endlessly. Zhang Zhenshan, a metal structure worker from Wuhan Iron and Steel Construction Company, didn't he also use his experience to teach more than 370 apprentices in just over a month!

This is not an ordinary phenomenon. The era of starving the master by teaching apprentices is gone forever. In our era, the relationship between people has been completely linked by the socialist friendship of "learning from each other, helping each other, learning from each other's strengths, and improving together." Those who have created advanced experience are spreading the seeds of advanced experience everywhere, letting advanced experience blossom and bear fruit everywhere, so that our production has developed and construction has accelerated. It is entirely foreseeable that when the advanced producers attending this conference return to their posts, a nationwide upsurge of learning and promoting advanced experience will be set off.

Our workers are such people: they are striding forward on the road to advancing towards science, so bravely and so tenaciously; whether they are learning from others or creating themselves, they are like this. Guo Zhanxiong, a sixty-eight-year-old oil refining engineer, is a good example of studying the desaltation of oil residue soap. A type of crude oil produced in our country contains too much salt; if it is not properly desalted during refining, it will shorten the life of the machine and reduce the oil yield. The commonly used desalting methods in the world cannot solve the desalting problem of this crude oil. Guo Zhanxiong proposed using oil residue soap for desalting. They did not succeed when they experimented. However, the old engineer suffering from hemiplegia did not lose heart. At night, when others were asleep, he took his young assistant into the laboratory. They experimented again and again like this more than 650 times, and finally succeeded. Cao Zhenhua, a technician at a cotton weaving factory, who has neither a high level of education nor has received special technical training, was able to successfully trial-produce ultra-short wave electrotherapy machines, inductive moisture measuring machines, electric precision balances, projection polarizing quality analyzers... Although these instruments are not new inventions in the world, it is enough to show how smart our workers are!

For thousands of years, the Chinese people have been known to the world for their amazing wisdom. In our era, this wisdom has shone more brilliantly in the bodies of thousands of advanced producers. Although our country's science and technology is still very backward, with such wisdom and such a spirit of perseverance, we can catch up with the world's advanced technical level in a not very long time and climb to the peak of science.

In the thousands of words of the representatives talking about the good start in the past and planning for a glorious future, they also mentioned a terrible word that deserves everyone's vigilance: pride. Although this does not mean that many people have been proud in the past, nor does it mean that many people will definitely be proud in the future, people are determined to put it out like bacteria. One representative said well: "Complacency is a trap that we have dug with our own hands. We swear: we will never suffer this loss." Naturally, some people have suffered such a loss, but they quickly learned a lesson, overcame their shortcomings, and continued to move forward. Liu Yaozong, a young adjuster at the First Automobile Manufacturing Factory, became an advanced producer only after overcoming his pride. He learned very complex adjustment techniques in a very short period of time, then forgot the Party's painstaking training and the comrades' patient help, became proud, looked down on the foreman, and refused to obey the foreman's leadership, so the adjustment work could not be carried out smoothly. The secretary of the Party branch in the workshop said to him at an ideological meeting: "It's a pity to be proud before the car has been produced. Think again about who taught you these techniques?" Liu Yaozong woke up in shock and felt ashamed. He hated himself and bravely said to the foreman: "I was wrong, please forgive me! I promise to do a good job in unity and do a good job." He corrected his shortcomings and created a new record of adjusting 150 times without accidents. Many representatives talked about this issue and were wary of pride. In the letter to all employees across the country, they promised: "We will always cherish the glory given to us by the Party and the country, study hard, never be proud, and advance again and again with all the employees on the brilliant road of socialism!"

At 4:00 p.m. on May 10, at the closing of the conference, more than 300 Young Pioneers, dressed in brightly colored spring clothes and waving beautiful bouquets, entered the venue in four routes. They lined up around the center of the venue, like colorful garlands around the advanced producers. A girl in a red dress walked onto the stage and paid tribute to the advanced producers. She said: Tens of thousands of red scarf hearts are waiting for you, and tens of thousands of children's eyes are looking forward to you, looking forward to you doing more work in different positions and creating more miracles. Everyone in the audience stood up, applauded, and the venue was boiling.

The conference closed. More than six thousand representatives, carrying the Party's instructions, the advanced experience they had learned, the children's expectations, and their own determination and confidence, went to meet new victories on the basis of victory!

    在胜利的基础上前进
    ——记全国先进生产者代表会议
    本报记者
    一个代表，又一个代表，踏着掌声走上台去。他们面对着六千多名代表，不，他们是面对着全国人民，汇报自己的工作。当他们叙述过去做了些什么的时候，态度是安详的，他们把那些深入草原，攀登雪峰，探测冰川，横渡怒江的惊心动魄的事迹，把那些为了一种新产品，一个技术改革，一个工程的进度，曾经进行过几百次试验，度过无数个不眠之夜的令人难忘的成就，说得那么平常。当他们谈到明天将要做些什么的时候，每个人都是兴奋的、也是兢兢业业的。他们知道，将要做的事情，比已经做了的多得多，也难得多！
    在中共中央代表刘少奇同志的祝词中，在政府各部门负责同志的讲话里，号召全国人民把祖国建成一个先进的社会主义工业强国。我们要让钢铁工厂生产更多的钢种；要让我们自己制造的飞机、汽车、拖拉机，飞翔和奔跑在祖国的天空和大地上；要让巨大的、新的高炉，出现在很多地方；要在黄河上建设几十座堤坝，拦住汹涌急湍的浊流，使它变清，让它发电，让它灌溉亿万亩良田；要把铁路、公路伸向最偏远的地方，要生产更多、更好、更便宜的轻工业产品，让人们生活得更美好；在那浩翰的处女林里，在从来没有人去过的高山、荒原和沙漠里，沉睡了多少万年的宝藏，急待着地质勘探人员去把它们唤醒；大片的草原日夜盼望着拖拉机手。还有多少更伟大的、更辉煌的事情需要我们去完成呵！
    这次空前规模的大会是一个检阅的会，它检阅了我国工人阶级的智慧和力量，也是一个动员的会，动员全体先进生产者和全国人民，去完成使我们自己和子孙万代过幸福生活的丰功伟业。到会的代表发出了这样的誓言：“在这个光辉的时代里，我们将不断地努力，实现党和人民交给的任务。”在这种誓言里，在大会发言、小组讨论和个别交谈中，都使人觉察到一股感人的力量在激励着大家。工人们的高贵品质就是这种力量的源泉。它使人相信我们一定能够在胜利的基础上迎取新的胜利。
    我们的工人是这样一些人：他们对国家的建设事业无限忠诚，在每一件细小工作里都充满了自觉的责任感，把自己的行动和国家的繁荣幸福紧紧连结在一起。李学义不正是这样的人吗？有一次他们小组在一个重点工程里，担任浇灌五十七根混凝土柱子的任务。打完了第一根柱子，发现质量不好，工作不能继续下去了。上冻的日子一天天逼近，工人们日夜焦虑，李学义也睡不着觉。有一天夜里三点多钟，忽然下起大雨，李学义抓起一件单衫跑向工地，把放在露天的五、六十袋水泥用席子盖上。在这风雨的夜晚，在这没有人的工地上，他想起了那根打坏了的柱子，情不自禁地走了过去，把手伸进模板，摸着冰冷的灰浆和石子，停留了很久，舍不得离开，心中千头万绪：怎样才能保证质量呢？他闷闷地离开了工地。他走着，想着，忘记了风雨、寒冷和疲劳。突然，一股水冲着他浇下来，他打了个寒战，抬起了头，透过昏暗的灯光，发现雨水正从房檐上的“水溜子”往下流。他心里一动，呆呆地站在雨里琢磨开了。从“水溜子”得到启发，他和大家研究出一种工具，解决了质量问题，提前十几天完成施工计划。
    这样的人，这样的事，有很多很多。在开始修建鹰厦铁路的时候，设计图纸发到工地。对施工单位来说，就是照图施工。可是，能不能把线路缩短一些，能不能把桥梁、涵洞的跨度和孔径改小一些？王志遂、花允璋、唐楚沅和许多人察看了不少汇水地区的自然情况，调查了河流的水有多大，流有多急，他们在一些线路上，往返奔走，提出了修改设计的方案，节约了一亿零二百万元，对保证鹰厦铁路提前一年通车起了巨大的作用。如果他们不是这样自觉地对待国家的建设，谁又能责备他们呢！
    这种忠诚，这种自觉，这种同国家利益无间的一致，曾经使我们克服了许许多多困难；千千万万的人在与困难作斗争中锻炼了自己，成长起来，始终高举着胜利的旗帜。大家都还记得，在战后的艰苦的年代里，铁水凝固在高炉里，机器停止了转动，厂房里长起了蒿草。我们的工人说：“要使这一切复活”，这个决心很快就实现了。在有计划的经济建设开始的日子里，浇灌那么大的基础，安装那么复杂的机器，生产那么精密的产品，对我们说来都是十分陌生的。我们的工人说：“学会它！掌握它！”这个决心也很快地实现了。在今后的建设大道上，有什么困难能够阻挡我们前进呢？
    我们的工人是这样一些人：他们能够满怀热情帮助别人，赶上自己，把自己所创造的一切先进经验看成是全民的财富。林瑞廷，四川的一个木工组长，从来没有停止过传播先进经验的工作。可是，当他从武汉学习了别人的先进经验，满载而归的时候，他感到的不止是高兴，同时也感到惭愧：当自己教别人的时候，别人是不是也满载而归呢？现在看来并不是这样，常常是自己的小组提前完成了任务，而其他的小组拖住了工程的后腿。他想：应该更好地教会别人。一个人就算浑身都是铁，能打几根钉子呢？如果全国工人都把效率提高一倍，那该有多么大的意义呵！后来，他们小组在六个月里，用了各种办法，帮助了八个小组一百零四个工人达到先进的水平。他们并不满足，今年又订了计划，要帮助二十六个小组的388人突破国家定额20％。
    在每一个工厂里，在每一个工地上，这样的事迹层出不穷。武汉钢铁建设公司金属结构工人张振山，不是也在一个多月的功夫里，用自己的经验，教会了三百七十多个徒弟吗！
    这不是一种寻常的现象。教会徒弟饿死师傅的时代已经一去不复返了。在我们的时代里，人与人之间的关系已经完全被“互相学习，互相帮助，取长补短，共同提高”的社会主义的情谊连结起来。那些创造了先进经验的人，到处散播着先进经验的种子，让先进经验遍地开花，遍地结果，使我们的生产发展了，建设加快了。完全可以预期，当出席这次大会的先进生产者回到自己的工作岗位后，在全国范围内将会掀起一个学习和推广先进经验的热潮。
    我们的工人是这样一些人：他们在向科学进军的道路上，昂首阔步，走得那么勇敢，那么顽强；不管是向别人学习，不管是自己创造，都是这样的。郭展雄，六十八岁的炼油工程师，研究用油脚皂脱盐的事迹就是一个很好的例子。我国生产的一种原油含盐太多；在炼制时，不很好地脱盐，就会缩短机器寿命，降低油的产量。世界通用的脱盐方法，都不能解决这种原油脱盐问题。郭展雄提出用油脚皂脱盐，他们试验的时候，也没有成功。但是，这个患有半身不遂症的老工程师并没有灰心。晚上，别人都睡觉了，他带着自己的年青助手走进试验室。他们就这样一次又一次试验了六百五十多次，最后，成功了。曹振华，棉织厂的一个技术员，文化程度既不高，又没有受过专门技术训练，他竟能够试制成功超短波的电疗机、电感测湿机、电动精密天秤、放映式偏振光品质分析仪……尽管这些仪器在世界上不是什么新的发明，却足以说明我们的工人是多么聪明！
    几千年来，中国人民是以具有惊人的智慧闻名于世的。在我们的时代里，这种智慧已经在千千万万先进生产者的身上发出更灿烂的光辉。尽管我们国家的科学技术还很落后，但是有了这样的智慧，有了这样的钻研精神，就可以在不很长的时间内赶上世界先进的技术水平，攀登上科学的峰顶。
    在代表们谈着过去良好的开始，计划着光辉未来的千言万语里，也曾经提到一个可怕的，值得所有人警惕的字眼：骄傲。尽管这并不是说过去有很多人都骄傲了，也不是说将来就一定有很多人会骄傲，然而人们都像对待细菌那样的，决心要扑灭它。一个代表说得好：“骄傲自满是我们亲手挖掘的陷井。我们起誓：绝对不吃这个亏。”自然，也有人吃过这样的亏，但是他们很快地接受了教训，克服缺点，继续前进。第一汽车制造厂年青的调整工刘耀宗就是克服了骄傲情绪，才成为先进生产者的。他在很短的时间内，学会了很复杂的调整工技术，便忘记了党的苦心培养，同志们的耐心帮助，骄傲起来，看不起工长，不服从工长的领导，调整工作不能顺利进行了。车间党支部书记在一次思想见面会上对他说：“汽车还没有生产出来就骄傲了，多可惜呵，再想想你学到的这些技术是谁教给你的？”刘耀宗惊醒过来，觉得惭愧，他恨自己，勇敢地对工长说：“我错了，原谅我吧！我保证搞好团结，搞好工作”。他改正了自己的缺点，创造了调整一百五十台次无事故的新纪录。许许多多代表都谈论着这个问题，警惕着骄傲。在告全国职工的信中，他们保证：“永远珍视党和国家给我们的光荣，努力学习，决不骄傲，和全体职工同志们一道在社会主义的光辉道路上前进再前进！”
    五月十日下午四时，在大会闭幕的时候，三百多名少年先锋队员穿着鲜艳的春装，挥动着美丽的花束，分四路进入会场。他们列队围绕在会场中心，像是彩色的花环套在先进生产者的身上。一个穿红裙子的女孩子走上台去，她向先进生产者致敬，她说：千万颗红领巾的心在期待着你们，千万双孩子的眼睛在盼望着你们，盼望着你们在各个不同的岗位上做更多的工作，创造出更多的奇迹。全场的人起立，鼓掌，会场沸腾了。
    大会闭幕了。六千多名代表带着党的指示，带着学到的先进经验，带着孩子们的期望，带着自己的决心和信心，在胜利的基础上去迎接新的胜利！
