Zhejiang Strengthens Field Management of Early Rice

Zhejiang Province has completed the transplanting of early rice. This year, the province has planted approximately ten million mu of double-season early rice, an increase of 40% compared to last year. The rice seedlings in Wenzhou and Jinhua prefectures, where transplanting began earlier, are still green, and the fields are a lush green.

Currently, agricultural production cooperatives across the province are strengthening the field management of rice. In Ruian and Songyang counties, where transplanting began earlier, weeding has been carried out one to three times, while in Huangyan County, weeding is done thoroughly to ensure the fields are level and smooth, and missing seedlings are replanted. In Lin'an, Yuhang, Xiaofeng, and other counties, 70% of the early rice fields are being weeded and fertilized simultaneously. Many agricultural production cooperatives across the province have also adopted the "five fixed" (fixed person, fixed field, fixed time, fixed quality, fixed water amount) and "seven fixed" systems of responsibility for field management in rice field management.

    浙江各地加强早稻田间管理
    浙江省已经完成早稻插秧。今年全省插下的双季早稻有一千万亩左右，双季种植比去年增加40％。早插秧的温州和金华专区秧苗还青，田间呈现一片葱绿。
    目前全省农业生产合作社正加强水稻的田间管理。插秧较早的瑞安、松阳两县普遍耘田一次到三次，黄岩县在耘田中做到耘平、耘光，补好缺苗，临安、余杭、孝丰等县70％的早稻田做到一边耘田、一边施肥。全省许多农业生产合作社在稻田管理中还采用了定人、定田、定时、定质、定水量等“五定”和“七定”的田间管理责任制。　（本报驻杭州记者）
