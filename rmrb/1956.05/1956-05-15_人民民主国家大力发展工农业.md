    North Korea Uses Electricity to Irrigate Farmland
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 13th - The 30,000 kVA of power transmission and distribution equipment newly laid in North Korea during the winter of last year and the spring of this year, leading to irrigation projects in various places, have recently been completed and are now supplying electricity. The newly built irrigation projects in various places are using this electricity to irrigate paddy fields.
    The newly laid power transmission and distribution equipment includes twenty-six substations, more than 170 kilometers of transmission lines, and more than 700 kilometers of distribution lines. In addition, the Korean electrical department supplied about 500 electric motors to pumping stations in various places this spring.
    After receiving these new electricity supplies this year, farmers in North Korea no longer need to use manual water carts and are replacing them entirely with electricity. Villages near the irrigation projects with added electrical equipment also have sufficient electricity for use.
    New Developments in Poland's Cooperativization Movement
    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 13th - According to a report by the Polish Press Agency on the 12th, Poland established 633 agricultural production cooperatives in the first quarter of this year, which is more than the total number of cooperatives established throughout last year. During this period, approximately 18,000 new members joined existing cooperatives, which is equivalent to the total number of new members absorbed by cooperatives last year.
    The new developments in Poland's cooperativization movement are inseparable from the production achievements of the cooperatives last year. In 1955, the national cooperatives' average yield of major grains reached 15 quintals per hectare, an increase of 3.2 quintals compared to 1954. The number of publicly owned livestock in the cooperatives also increased. In 1954, the cooperatives averaged only 17.5 pigs per 100 hectares of arable land, while in 1955, this increased to 21.8.
    The income of cooperative members has also increased significantly. In 1954, the average income of each farming household participating in a cooperative was more than 2,340 zlotys (Polish currency) in cash and 14.4 quintals of grain, while in 1955, each cooperative household received 3,126 zlotys in cash and more than 20 quintals of grain.
    Vietnam Begins Construction of Sixteen Projects
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 14th - Vietnam has begun construction on sixteen new construction projects.
    Among these projects is a new-style mining project for the apatite mine in Lao Cai, Northwest Vietnam. This apatite mine has extremely rich reserves, and after the mine construction project is completed, it will supply Vietnamese farmers with a large amount of chemical fertilizer.
    The construction project of the Cao Bang Tinh Tuc tin mine is also an important project, and some of the newly built factory buildings there have already begun installing machinery.
    These projects also include the Nam Dinh spinning and weaving mill, match factory, medium-sized machine manufacturing factory, brewery, beer factory near Hanoi, the Hai Phong fish cannery, the Phu Tho tea factory, and others. In addition, there are also some power plants and hydroelectric stations.
    Hungary's First Nuclear Reactor
    Will Begin Operation Within Two Years
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 14th - According to a report by the Hungarian News Agency on the 13th, Hungary's first nuclear reactor will begin operation at the end of 1957 or the beginning of 1958.
    This reactor is being built with the help of Soviet experts and will produce a sufficient quantity of isotopes for Hungary. In order to install this reactor, a special three-story building has been prepared on Freedom Hill in Buda. Construction work will begin at the end of May this year.

    人民民主国家大力发展工农业
    朝鲜农村用电力灌溉农田
    新华社平壤13日电　朝鲜北部在去年冬天和今年春天新敷设的通往各地灌溉工程的共为三万千伏安的送电配电设备已经在最近全部完工，并且开始送电。现在各地新建的灌溉工程正在使用这些电力向秧田里灌水。
    新敷设的送电配电设备包括二十六个变电所，一百七十多公里长的送电线和七百多公里长的配电线。另外，朝鲜电气部门今春还供给各地抽水站约五百部电动机。
    朝鲜北部的农民今年得到这些新的电力供应后，已经用不着用人力车水，全部用电力代替。增设了电气设备的灌溉工程附近的农村，还得到充足的用电。
    波兰合作化运动有新发展
    新华社华沙13日电　据波兰通讯社十二日报道，波兰在今年第一季成立了633个农业生产合作社，比去年全年成立的合作社还多。在这个期间，加入原有的合作社的新社员达到了一万八千人左右，相当于合作社去年吸收的新社员的总数。
    波兰合作化运动的新发展是和合作社去年的生产成就分不开的。1955年，全国合作社主要谷物的产量平均每公顷达到了十五公担，比1954年增加了三点二公担。合作社公有牲畜的头数也增加了。1954年，合作社每一百公顷耕地平均只有十七点五口猪，而1955年就增加到二十一点八口。
    社员的收入也大大增加了。1954年，参加合作社的农民每一家的收入平均是二千三百四十多个兹罗提（波币名）现金和十四点四公担谷物，而1955年，每一个合作农户就分别得到三千一百二十六个兹罗提现金和二十公担以上的谷物。
    越南开始兴建十六项工程
    新华社河内14日电　越南已经有十六项新的建设工程开始兴建。
    在这些工程中，有越南西北老街的磷灰石矿的新式开采工程。这个磷灰石矿蕴藏量极为丰富，在建矿工程完成以后，它将供应越南农民大量的化学肥料。
    高平静宿锡矿的建设工程也是重要的一项，那里新建的厂房里已经部分地开始安装机器。
    这些工程中还有河内近郊的粘木和锯木厂、火柴厂、中型机器制造厂、酿酒厂、啤酒厂和海防的鱼罐头厂、富寿的茶叶工厂等。此外还有一些发电厂和水电站。
    匈第一个原子反应堆
    将在两年内开始运转
    新华社布拉格14日电　据匈牙利通讯社十三日报道，匈牙利第一个原子反应堆将在1957年年底或者1958年年初开始运转。
    这个反应堆是在苏联专家帮助下建造的，它将为匈牙利生产足够数量的同位素。为了安装这个反应堆，已经准备在布达的自由山上专门建筑一座三层楼的建筑物。建筑工作将在今年五月底开始。
