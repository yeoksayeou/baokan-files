    Commemorating Kālidāsa, the Great Ancient Indian Poet
    Jì Xiànlín
    The World Peace Council has called for the commemoration of Kālidāsa, the great ancient Indian poet, as one of the world cultural celebrities this year. We feel an indescribable excitement seeing that the precious cultural heritage of our old friends, the Indian people, is becoming more and more understood and appreciated by people all over the world.

    Indian classical literature has a long and glorious historical tradition. From the Rigveda of more than 1,000 years BC, this tradition can be said to have been basically uninterrupted. During the Gupta Dynasty from the 4th to the 6th centuries AD, the development of Sanskrit literature reached a brilliant peak. At this time, India had made brilliant achievements in both economic and political aspects. There were also amazing developments in literature and art. The Ajanta murals, which the World Peace Council called for commemoration last year, also began in this era.

    It is entirely understandable that Kālidāsa, recognized as India's greatest poet, lived in this era.

    We know very little about the year of birth and death of this great poet. Sanskrit scholars from various countries have written countless articles to discuss this issue, but no unanimous conclusion has been reached so far. It is generally believed that he was born in the late 4th to early 5th centuries AD, during the heyday of the Gupta Dynasty.

    Kālidāsa left behind many works. However, like his birth and death dates, the authenticity of his works has also aroused much controversy. The works generally considered reliable are: the plays "Shakuntala" and "Vikramorvasheeyam", the lyric poem "Meghadūta" (The Cloud Messenger), and the narrative poems "Kumārasambhava" (The Birth of Kumāra) and "Raghuvamsha" (The Dynasty of Raghu). In addition, two other works, "Mālavikāgnimitram" and "Ritusamhara" (The Seasons), are also likely to be Kālidāsa's works.

    For more than a thousand years, Kālidāsa's works have been loved and recited by the vast population of various ethnic groups in India. His works have been translated into various Indian languages. In the history of Indian literature, many poets have imitated his works. Even today, his plays are still being performed. In the last one or two hundred years, since European scholars came into contact with the brilliant ancient Indian literary works, his works have been successively translated into many European languages. Take "Shakuntala" as an example. It was translated into English in 1789, and then translated from English into German in 1791. It immediately aroused praise in Europe that is almost unimaginable today. The great German poets Herder, Goethe, and Schiller all enthusiastically praised it. Goethe even wrote poems to express his enthusiasm. It is said that the prologue in heaven in his famous work "Faust" was influenced by "Shakuntala." To date, "Shakuntala" has translations in the following languages: Russian, Czech, Polish, Hungarian, German, English, French, Danish, Dutch, Italian, Swedish, and Spanish, and some languages have more than one translation. The situation is the same with Kālidāsa's other works. This is enough to show how much his works are loved by people all over the world.

    Kālidāsa's works are not unfamiliar to the Chinese people either. The lyric poem "Meghadūta" was translated into Tibetan around the 13th century and included in the Tanjur. In modern times, Su Manshu also noticed Kālidāsa's works and intended to translate and introduce them. In the last two or three decades, we have had several translations of "Shakuntala."

    Why have Kālidāsa's works been loved by the vast population at home and abroad for such a long time? Let's try to analyze his masterpiece "Shakuntala" first.

    We all know that the Gupta Dynasty was the period when Indian slave society reached its peak. Although the story of "Shakuntala" is taken from the ancient Indian epic "Mahabharata," and the names of the characters are old names; however, the actions and ideological consciousness of these ancient half-human, half-divine figures are those of the 4th and 5th centuries AD. Through the description of these characters, Kālidāsa concretely reflects the life and ideological consciousness of the upper ruling class of Indian slave society. He described many upper-class rulers in this play. Kālidāsa was not completely satisfied with the words and deeds of these great figures. He sometimes used the clown's jokes to satirize and criticize them.

    On the other hand, many lower-level ruled people also appear. In the sixth act, several palace maids appear. Judging from their tone of speech, they seem to be slaves that the governor paid tribute to the king. In slave society, especially in the era when slavery reached its peak, the upper ruling class generally looked down on slaves. In their eyes, slaves are simply not human, but born to be beasts of burden. Kālidāsa himself was a Brahmin and possibly a court poet, undoubtedly a member of the upper class of slave society. However, when describing the palace maids, he portrayed them as innocent, lively, and very lovable normal people.

    In Indian classical literature, there are very few descriptions of the lives of the masses of people. In the interlude at the beginning of the sixth act of "Shakuntala," Kālidāsa describes a fisherman. He caught a large carp, opened its belly, and found a ring engraved with the king's name inside. As a result, he was arrested as a thief and taken to the government office. Fishermen and hunters were considered the lowest classes in India, almost despised by humans. However, the fisherman in Kālidāsa's pen is also an extremely normal person.

    What is particularly noteworthy is that Kālidāsa used extremely ingenious techniques in this play to vividly write about the yearning of the oppressed people for a better life and their love for all beautiful things. I have already mentioned the two palace maids that the governor paid tribute to the king. They live in seclusion in the deep palace, and although they say they are "doing chores," they are actually working like beasts of burden. We can imagine that their lives must be unpleasant. However, this kind of life did not suppress their love for the bright spring. When spring came, mango flowers bloomed in the garden. The king missed Shakuntala and was not in the mood to celebrate the festival himself, nor did he allow others to celebrate. But these two slave palace maids ran to the garden to pick flowers, preparing to offer them to the god of love. They laughed and talked to their heart's content in the garden, enjoying the bright spring with its brocade-like flowers. This yearning for a better life and love for all beautiful things on the part of the oppressed people is very precious. In a class society, this spirit of the oppressed is the driving force and foundation for struggle and resistance.

    This yearning for a better life is not only expressed in "Shakuntala," it runs through almost all of Kālidāsa's works. Parvati in Kumārasambhava also expresses this spirit. In "Meghadūta," although the Yaksha who was punished to leave his hometown was separated from his beloved wife and missed her very much, and in desperation, he had to entrust the clouds to bring a message to his lover; however, the overall tone contains some optimistic elements in the faint sorrow of separation, without any depression or giving people a feeling of discouragement. I think this point of Kālidāsa is very prominent.

    In addition, there is another point of Kālidāsa that is very important. In his works, every grass and tree, every mountain and water, every beast, every bird, every flower, every cloud, as well as the morning glow, the evening sunset, the clear light of the autumn moon, the sudden rain in summer, are all content and happy, vivid and delightful. We can see how the poet loved these things on the land of his motherland. He passed this love to us 1,500 years later through his works. When we foreign readers read his works, we can't help but love these things. Isn't it natural that Indian readers feel a love for their homeland when they read them?

    Speaking of the artistry of his works, he also has his own characteristics. In shaping characters, he reached an astonishing degree of realism. The realism he achieved more than a thousand years ago still cannot but make us admire him today. If we compare him with the general level of Indian literature at that time, he appears even more prominent. The characters in his works, no matter who they are, whether they are kings or national teachers, fishermen or slaves, heavenly gods or immortals, are all concrete, real, and lifelike, as if they are living before our eyes. The language he used is basically Sanskrit. By the time of the Gupta Dynasty, this language was no longer a living language, but a so-called elegant language. However, compared to those writers of his time, the Sanskrit in his pen is lively and fluent, full of vitality. His words are gorgeous, but not piled up; he abides by traditional poetic methods, but is not artificial. The language as a means of expression is an indivisible unity with the content he wants to express. Using lively and fluent language to express an eternally optimistic and forward-looking spirit, to express love for life and natural things, this is the artistic characteristic of Kālidāsa, and this is the reason why his works have been loved by the vast population all over the world for such a long time.

    The influence of this great ancient Indian poet has long transcended the borders of India. His works have become a shining gem in the cultural treasure house of people all over the world, and have strengthened the understanding of Indian literature and art by people of various countries. The reason why great writers of different eras and regions around the world are great is that they educate the people through their works, so that they respect each other, learn from each other, and understand each other. We believe that through this commemoration, the friendship between peace-loving people all over the world will be further consolidated, and the determination to defend peace and strive for the noble cause of mankind will be further strengthened.

    纪念印度古代伟大诗人迦梨陀娑
    季羡林
    今年世界和平理事会号召纪念的世界文化名人里面有印度古代伟大的诗人迦梨陀娑。我们看到，我们的老朋友印度人民的宝贵的文化遗产愈来愈为全世界人民所了解，所欣赏，心里有说不出的兴奋。
    印度古典文学有悠久的光荣的历史传统。从公元前一千多年的梨俱吠陀起，这个传统可以说是基本上没有中断。到了公元四世纪到六世纪的笈多王朝时代，梵文文学的发展达到了光辉的顶点。这时候，印度在经济和政治方面都有了辉煌的成就。文学和艺术也有了惊人的发展。去年世界和平理事会号召纪念的阿旃陀壁画也开始于这个时代。
    公认为印度最伟大的诗人迦梨陀娑生在这个时代，这是完全可以理解的。
    关于这位伟大诗人的生年卒月，我们知道得非常少。各国的梵文学者不知道写过多少文章来讨论这问题，但是到现在还没能得到一致的结论。一般都认为他生于公元四世纪末至五世纪初，正是笈多王朝的全盛时期。
    迦梨陀娑留下了不少作品。但是，正如他的生年卒月，他的作品的真伪也引起了不少的争论。一般都认为是可靠的作品有：剧本“沙恭达罗”和“优哩婆湿”，抒情诗“云使”，叙事诗“鸠摩罗出世”和“ 罗怙世系”。此外还有两部著作：“摩罗毗伽与阿只你密多罗”和“时令之环”，也很可能是迦梨陀娑的作品。
    在过去一千多年以内，迦梨陀娑的作品为印度各族广大人民所爱好，所传诵。他的作品被译成了各种不同的印度语言。在印度文学史上，有许多诗人模拟过他的作品。一直到今天，他的剧本还在上演。近一、二百年以来，自从欧洲学者接触到印度古代光辉灿烂的文学作品以后，他的作品又陆续地译成许多欧洲语言。就拿“沙恭达罗”来作例子吧。1789年译为英文，1791年又从英文转译成德文。在欧洲立刻引起了今天简直难以想像的赞颂。德国大诗人赫德、歌德和席勒都热烈地加以赞扬。歌德甚至写诗来表达自己的热情。他的名著“浮士德”里的天上序曲据说就是受了“沙恭达罗”的影响。到今天为止，“沙恭达罗”共有下列各种语言的译本：俄文、捷克文、波兰文、匈牙利文、德文、英文、法文、丹麦文、荷兰文、意大利文、瑞典文、西班牙文，而且有些语言还不止有一种译本。迦梨陀娑的其它著作情形也一样。这就足以说明，他的作品是怎样为全世界人民所爱好了。
    对中国人民来说，迦梨陀娑的作品也并不是陌生的。抒情诗“云使”大约在十三世纪就译成了藏文，而且编在丹珠尔里面。到了近代，苏曼殊又注意到迦梨陀娑的作品，而且打算翻译介绍。近二、三十年以来，我们有了好几种“沙恭达罗”的译本。
    迦梨陀娑的作品为什么能在这样长的时间内受到国内国外广大人民的爱好呢？我们先拿他的杰作“沙恭达罗”来试着分析一下吧。
    我们都知道，笈多王朝是印度奴隶社会发展到了顶点的时期。“沙恭达罗”的故事虽然取材于印度古代史诗“摩诃婆罗多”，人物的名字是老名字；但是这些古代半人半神的人物的举动和思想意识却是公元四、五世纪的。迦梨陀娑通过对这些人物的描写，具体地反映了印度奴隶社会上层统治者的生活情况和思想意识。他在这个剧本里描写了许多上层统治者。迦梨陀娑对这一些大人物的言行并不是全满意的。他有时就利用丑角的插科打诨对他们加以讽刺和批评。
    在另一方面，许多下层的被统治者也出了场。在第六幕里，出现了几个宫女，听讲话的口气，她们很像是总督进贡给国王的奴隶。在奴隶社会里，特别是在奴隶制发展到了顶点的时代里，上层统治者一般都是看不起奴隶的。在他们眼中，奴隶简直不是人，而是天生当牛马的。迦梨陀娑自己是婆罗门，可能又是宫廷诗人，无疑地是奴隶社会的上层分子。然而，在描写宫女的时候，他却把她们俩写得天真无邪，生动活泼，写成很可爱的极其正常的人。
    在印度古典文学里，描写人民群众生活的非常少。在“沙恭达罗”第六幕开始的插曲里，迦梨陀娑描写了一个渔夫。他捉住了一条大鲤鱼，剖开肚子，在里面找到了一只刻着国王名字的戒指。结果他被当作贼捉将官里去。渔夫、猎师在印度都被认为是最低的阶层，几乎是不齿于人类的。然而在迦梨陀娑笔下的渔夫也是一个极其正常的人。
    特别值得我们注意的一点就是，迦梨陀娑在这个剧本里用极其巧妙的手法具体生动地写出了被压迫的人们对于美好生活的响往和对于一切美的东西的热爱。上面我已经谈到那两个总督老爷进贡给国王的宫女。她们幽居深宫，虽然自己嘴里说是“做些杂活”，实际上就是做牛做马。我们能够想像到，她们的生活一定是不愉快的。然而这种生活并没有抑压住她们对于明媚的春天的热爱。春天到了，花园里开了芒果花。国王因为怀念沙恭达罗，自己没有心情过节，也不许别人过。但是这两个奴隶宫女却跑到花园里来采花，准备献给爱神。她们在花园里尽情地说笑，尽情地欣赏这繁花如锦的明媚的春光。被压迫的人们的这一点对于美好生活的响往，对于一切美的东西的热爱，是很值得珍贵的。在有阶级的社会里，被压迫者这种精神就是斗争和反抗的动力和基础。
    这种对美好生活的响往并不只是表现在“沙恭达罗”里，它几乎贯穿在迦梨陀娑的全部作品里。鸠摩罗出世里的波罗伐提表现的也是这种精神。在“云使”里，尽管那个被罚离乡的药叉同爱妻分离，忆念不置，在无可奈何中，只好托云彩给爱人带讯；但是，通篇情调在淡淡的离愁别恨中总有一些乐观的成分，丝毫也不沮丧，丝毫也不给人灰心丧气的感觉。我觉得，迦梨陀娑这一点是很突出的。
      此外，迦梨陀娑还有一点很值得重视。在他的作品里，他所描写的一草一木，一山一水，一头兽，一只鸟，一朵花，一片云，以及早晨的霞光，黄昏的夕照，秋月的清辉，夏日的骤雨，无不怡然自得，生动可喜。我们可以看出来，诗人是如何热爱祖国大地上的这些东西。他通过自己的作品把这种热爱传给一千五百年以后的我们。我们国外的读者读了他的作品，都不禁热爱起这些东西来。印度读者读了会油然而起热爱乡国之情，不是很自然的吗？
    谈到他的作品的艺术性，他也有自己的特点。在塑造人物方面，他达到惊人的真实的程度。他在一千多年前达到的那种真实性今天还不能不让我们钦佩。如果拿当时印度文学一般的水平来同他比，他就显得更突出了。在他作品里的人物，不管他是什么人，是国王、国师也好，是渔夫、奴隶也好，是天上神仙也好，都是具体真实，栩栩如生，仿佛就活在我们眼前。他使用的语言基本上是梵文。这种语言到了笈多王朝时代，早已不是活的语言，而是所谓雅语了。但是，同那些和他同时代的作家比较起来，他笔下的梵文是生动流利的，生气勃勃的。他的词藻华丽，但是并不堆砌；他遵守传统的诗法，但是并不矫揉造作。作为表现手段的语言同他所要表现的内容是一个不可分割的统一体。用生动流利的语言表现永远乐观、永远向前看的精神，表现对人生对自然事物的热爱，这就是迦梨陀娑艺术的特点，这就是他的作品在这样长的时间内为全世界广大人民所喜爱的原因。
    这位印度古代的伟大诗人影响早已超越了印度的国界。他的作品已成为全世界人民文化宝库里的一块光辉灿烂的宝石，而且加强了各国人民对印度文学艺术的了解。全世界不同时代不同地域的伟大作家之所以伟大，就在于他们通过自己的作品教育人民，使他们互相尊重，互相学习，互相了解。我们相信，通过这一次纪念，全世界爱好和平的人民间的友谊将会更巩固，保卫和平为人类崇高事业而奋斗的决心也会更加强。（附图片）
