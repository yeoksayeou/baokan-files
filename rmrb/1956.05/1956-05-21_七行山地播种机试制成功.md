    Seven-Row Hillside Seeder Successfully Trial-Produced
    The Xi'an Agricultural Implement Research Institute has recently successfully trial-produced a seven-row hillside seeder. This seeder is suitable for mountainous areas and can also be used in plains. It can sow seven rows at a time, and the row spacing and depth can be flexibly adjusted. The machine body is light and can be pulled by only one relatively strong animal or two smaller animals. Working ten hours a day, it can sow about forty mu, which is about twice the efficiency of the old-fashioned drill seeder. In addition to sowing wheat, it can also sow millet, corn, sorghum, beans and other crops.

    七行山地播种机试制成功
    西安农具研究所最近试制成功了一种七行山地播种机。这种播种机，适用于山区，也能用于平原地带，一次能播种七行，行距、深浅都能灵活调节。机身轻便，只要一头比较强壮的牲畜或两头较小的牲畜就能拉动。每天工作十小时，可以播种四十亩左右，比旧式耧播种效率提高约一倍。除可播种小麦外，还能播种糜、谷、玉米、高粱、豆类等作物。
