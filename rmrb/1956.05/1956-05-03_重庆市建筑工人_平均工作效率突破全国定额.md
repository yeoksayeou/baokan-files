Chongqing Construction Workers

Average Work Efficiency Exceeds National Quota

For more than three months this year, the average work efficiency of construction workers in Chongqing has exceeded the national unified quota by 18%, with bricklayers exceeding the quota by 40%. The quality of the projects has also greatly improved. More than thirty construction sites in the city have not experienced any major quality or work-related injuries; nine construction sites have gone more than a month without any quality accidents.

Since January this year, in the extensive campaign of advanced producers in the city's construction industry, more than 300 advanced producers have emerged, creating many advanced operating methods and advanced tools, raising work efficiency and quality to advanced levels. The Chongqing Municipal Construction Industry leadership promptly organized technical personnel to comprehensively summarize the operational experience of various types of work, and gradually promoted it, thus significantly improving work efficiency and quality.

    重庆市建筑工人
    平均工作效率突破全国定额
    今年三个多月以来，重庆市建筑业工人的平均工作效率，已经突破全国统一定额18％，其中砖工已经突破定额40％。工程质量也大有提高。全市出现了三十多个未发生重大质量事故和工伤事故的工地；九个工地做到一个月以上没有发生任何质量事故。
    从今年一月份到现在，全市建筑业在广泛开展先进生产者运动中，涌现了三百多名先进生产者，创造了许多先进操作法和先进工具，把工作效率和质量提高到先进水平。重庆市建筑业领导部门及时组织技术力量，将各工种的操作经验加以综合总结，并且逐步推广，因而使工作效率和质量显著提高。（据新华社讯）
