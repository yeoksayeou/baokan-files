　　At the First Automobile Works
    Chassis Assembly Completed
    The chassis workshop of the First Automobile Works has been very lively recently, with a constant stream of visitors. This workshop was the first to complete the production adjustment work, begin continuous material input, and test a流水式 production (assembly line) system.
    On many production lines, people saw various complex automobile parts that had already been manufactured. The workers assembled the processed parts into the five major assemblies of the chassis. On April 27th, when the assembly was completed, the visitors and the workshop employees all wore smiles of victory on their faces. On the eve of "May Day," the chassis workshop employees had assembled fifty sets of assemblies.
    After inspection, this batch of assemblies fully met the quality standards. Soon, they will be assembled with the engine, cab, water tank, transmission and other assemblies to produce the first batch of domestically produced automobiles.

    Green Car Bodies Made
    The huge drying room in the carpentry workshop of the First Automobile Works is drying the hard and light fish-scale pine boards used to manufacture car bodies. Drilling beds, small surface planers and other machines quickly process the dried pine boards into various car body parts. High up on the hanging rails are blocks of assembled car body floorboards and sideboards.
    The carpentry workshop officially started production in April, and by April 25th, it had already completed the April production target ahead of schedule, assembling one hundred and sixteen automobile car bodies. The design quota for assembling a car body is nine minutes, but the workers assembled them in eight and a half minutes. The assembled car bodies have been painted a beautiful dark green. In the near future, they will be installed on domestically produced automobiles. (Li Zhongyi)
    Support from Forty-Six Factories
    In order to support the early production of automobiles by the First Automobile Works, forty-six factories across the country are producing more than four hundred kinds of collaborative products for it. At present, 333 kinds of qualified collaborative products have been sent to the First Automobile Works. A large number of tires sent by the State-owned First Rubber Factory have been installed on the trial-assembled automobiles, and after trial use, they have proven to be of good quality. The storage batteries produced by the Shenyang Battery Factory have also passed the trial use. Spark plugs, steering wheels, etc., which China has never been able to manufacture before, have also been successfully trial-produced and will soon be supplied to the First Automobile Works.

    First to Reach the Designed Quota
    A moving message came from the chassis workshop of the First Automobile Works: female grinder Dong Guiqing, making the outer circle of the half-shaft gear, was the first to reach the designed quota.
    More than two years ago, Dong Guiqing was still a female student at a junior normal school. When she first arrived at the automobile factory, she was so frightened by the many complex and booming machine tools that she ran backwards. At that time, she stood behind her master watching him operate all day long, and she did not dare to do it herself. Last November, she began to operate the machine tool, but she could not make the workpiece in time, which affected the idleness of the upper and lower processes. Therefore, she seized all the time to study the technology, recorded the shortcomings in her daily operation, and looked for the reasons why she worked slowly. She found that the auxiliary time was long, often because the method of measuring the work was not right, so she improved the method of measuring the work. As a result, she spent only one and a half minutes to make an outer circle of a half-shaft gear, and was the first to reach the designed quota and was named an advanced producer. (Li Zhongyi)
    Greening the Automobile City
    Recently, many young workers at the First Automobile Works have been running to the open spaces during their off-duty and rest hours, happily planting trees. They want to green the automobile city in a very short time to welcome the day when automobiles are produced.
    In the very middle of the beautiful factory buildings, on both sides of what is called the Central Avenue, and around the thermal power plant that emits billowing green smoke all day long, employees have already planted tens of thousands of trees. More than a dozen kinds of flowers and trees planted around the flower beds on Central Avenue will soon blossom into flowers. On the afternoon of April 26th, Soviet experts also came to Central Avenue and planted many flowers and trees. This year, the First Automobile Works will plant five to six hundred thousand trees on the open spaces inside and outside the factory. When automobiles are produced this year, people will see the green small trees surrounding the factory area and the employees' living area.

　　在第一汽车制造厂
    装出了底盘总成
    第一汽车制造厂底盘车间最近非常热闹，参观的人群络绎不绝。这个车间最先完成了调整生产的工作，开始连续投料，试行流水式的生产。
    在许多条生产线上，人们看到各种各样复杂的汽车零件已经制造出来。工人们把加工好的零件，试装成底盘的五大总成。四月二十七日，在装出总成的时候，参观的人们和这个车间的职工一起，脸上都露出了胜利的微笑。“五一”前夕，底盘车间职工已经装出五十套总成。
    这批总成经过检验，完全合乎质量标准。不久它们就要和发动机、驾驶室、水箱变速箱等总成一起，装配出第一批国产的汽车。

    绿色车箱做好了
    第一汽车制造厂木工车间巨大的干燥室在烘干制造车箱用的又硬又轻的鱼鳞松板。钻眼床、小面刨等各种机器，很快地把烘干后的松板加工成各种车箱零件。高高的吊轨上悬挂着一块块装配好了的车箱底板和边板。
    木工车间在四月份正式生产，到四月二十五日已经提前完成了四月份的生产任务，装配出一百一十六辆汽车车箱。装配一辆车箱的设计定额是九分钟，工人们用八分半钟就装好了。一辆辆装好了的车箱已经被漆成美丽的深绿色。不久的将来，它们就要被安装到国产汽车上去。（李中一）
    四十六个工厂的支援
    为了支援第一汽车制造厂提前出产汽车，全国四十六个工厂在为它生产四百多种协作产品。现在，送到第一汽车制造厂的合格的协作产品，已经有333种。国营第一橡胶厂送来的大量轮胎，已经装到试装好的汽车上去，经过试用，证明质量良好。沈阳电池厂出产的蓄电池，也已经试用合格了。中国从来不能制造的火花寨、转向盘等，也都试制成功，就要供应给第一汽车制造厂。（本报驻长春记者）
    第一个达到设计定额
    第一汽车制造厂底盘车间传出一个动人的消息：女磨工董桂卿做半轴齿轮外圆，第一个达到了设计定额。
    两年多以前，董桂卿还是个初级师范的女学生。她刚到汽车厂的时候，看到许多复杂的轰轰响的机床，吓得直往后跑。那时候，她整天站在师傅背后看着师傅操作，自己不敢动手。去年十一月，她开始操纵机床，不能及时做出工件，影响上下工序窝工。于是，她抓紧一切时间，钻研技术，把每天操作中的缺点记下来，寻找自己工作慢的原因。她发现辅助时间长，往往是因为量活的方法不对头，她便改进了量活的方法。结果，她只用一点五分钟做出了一个半轴齿轮外圆，第一个达到了设计定额，被评为先进生产者。　　（李中一）
    绿化汽车城
    最近，第一汽车制造厂的许多年轻工人，在下班和休息的时候就跑到空地上，愉快地种植树木，他们要在很短的时间内，绿化汽车城，迎接出产汽车的日子。
    在一栋栋美丽的厂房的正中间，在被人称为中央大道的两旁，在整天冒着滚滚青烟的热电站的四周，职工们已经种上了好几万棵树。种在中央大道的花坛四周的十多种花木，不久就要开放出一朵朵鲜花。四月二十六日下午，苏联专家们也来到中央大道，种植了许多花木。今年第一汽车制造厂要在厂内外空地上，种植五、六十万棵树。在今年出产汽车的时候，人们将要看到环绕厂区和职工生活区的碧绿的小树。
