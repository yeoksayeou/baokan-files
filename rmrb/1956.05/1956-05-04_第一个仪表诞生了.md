    The First Meter is Born
    On May 1st, the Harbin Electricity Meter and Instrument Factory produced its first meter.
    When the first meter had gone through twenty-four processes and seven microscopic and other inspection processes, and the final, most stringent quality inspection was being carried out, the female section chief and technicians all came to the front of the test bench. The female test worker, Hong Guilan, put on rubber gloves and placed the assembled meter into the test bench, turned on the high voltage current, and after a minute, the test bench did not sound the alarm indicating meter damage. Only then did all the workers in the workshop breathe a sigh of relief; the meter was qualified. The female worker Liu Guilan, who was responsible for the final process, smilingly screwed on the bottom of the meter, and the inspector stamped the qualified inspection mark. Thus, the first meter—a Type 201 ammeter—was born. (According to Xinhua News Agency report)

    第一个仪表诞生了
    五月一日，哈尔滨电表仪器厂出产了第一个仪表。
    当第一个仪表经过了二十四道工序和七道显微镜等检查工序，进行最后一次最严格的质量检查的时候，女工段长和工艺员们都来到了试验台的前面，女试验工洪桂兰带上橡皮手套把装好的仪表放进试验台，通上高电压电流，过了一分钟，试验台没有发出仪表损坏的铃声，这时，全车间的职工才舒了一口气，仪表合格了。担任最后一道工序的女工刘桂兰笑迷迷扣上表底螺丝，检查员盖上了合格检印，于是第一个仪表——二零一型电流表诞生了。　（据新华社讯）
