Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 27th - China-made five-tube radios have begun to be exported. In the past two months, more than 400 radios have been shipped from Shanghai to supply Syria, Lebanon, Malaya, Singapore, Thailand, and Nigeria.

These radios are products of China's state-owned radio factories. More than sixty parts, including five different vacuum tubes, are all made in China. It has shortwave, medium wave, and long wave bands, and is very sensitive, so it can be used to receive broadcasts from radio stations around the world. This radio has good heat resistance and can be used continuously for eight hours at 40 degrees Celsius. Each part is coated with a layer of moisture-proof wax to adapt to the tropical environments of Asia and Africa.
