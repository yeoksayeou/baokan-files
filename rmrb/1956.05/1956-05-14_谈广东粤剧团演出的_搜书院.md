    On the Guangdong Cantonese Opera Troupe's Performance of "Searching the Academy"
    Ouyang Yuqian
    "Searching the Academy" is one of the most popular traditional Cantonese opera repertoires. The recent performance of this play by the Guangdong Cantonese Opera Troupe in the capital marks a new atmosphere of Cantonese opera reform. Everything is very different from what I used to see in Guangzhou and Hong Kong. This play has a clear theme, obvious tendencies, and discernible love and hate. The image of the positive character, Xie Bao, in the play is very vivid and real.
    "Searching the Academy" gives us a novel impression from the very beginning: the town magistrate's daughter and her maid, Cuilian, are flying kites in the garden. Through their highly dance-like movements, the audience feels that the kite is actually being flown. They let out the string, reel it in, move forward and backward, raise their hands, and somersault, indicating the strength of the wind, the kite's height. They sing a little tune, "Double Flying Butterflies," while flying the kite. This is a beautiful scene. This kind of performance comes from folk operas and becomes novel and interesting after appropriate processing. Hong Xiannu, who plays Cuilian, gives a very moving performance.
    Xie Bao's scene of stepping on the moon is performed quite simply and humorously. Ma Shizeng has unique insights into playing various roles, especially excelling at comedy. This is the first time I have seen him play a role like Xie Bao. He portrays Xie Bao as a kind and amiable, knowledgeable, righteous, self-disciplined, tolerant, and humorous elder who is not afraid of the powerful. I think this is right. His character and his actions are not contradictory.
    The scene where Cuilian escapes to the academy and meets Zhang Yimin seems a bit simple. She and Zhang Yimin met once when they were looking for the kite. Zhang Yimin didn't recognize her at first. After she revealed her identity, Cuilian told him that if he took her in, she would entrust herself to him for life; if he refused her, she would become a nun. A young girl seeks refuge in a young man's room and happens to meet the person she desires. The excitement of her heart can be imagined. Zhang Yimin is naturally very surprised by this unexpected event. At this time, both of them are in a difficult situation. Zhang Yimin wants to keep her, but there are many difficulties; if he doesn't keep her, she has nowhere to go; he is a little afraid to tell his teacher, and she may not agree; finally, he is moved by her beauty, intelligence, and courage, and sympathizes with her unfortunate experience, so he decides to keep her. The depiction of these dramatic processes and the portrayal of the characters of these two people seem to be insufficient.
    Ma Shizeng's performance in the "Searching the Academy" scene is quite wonderful, but I think it could be developed more. Perhaps due to the limitations of the script, the actors have not been able to fully exert their strengths. The ending of the play also seems a bit hasty. At that time, Cuilian was not yet out of danger, and celebrating with singing and dancing seems a little premature.
    The cast of this play is very complete. It goes without saying that Ma Shizeng and Hong Xiannu are the most talented and popular actors. Several other roles, although not many, are played by first-class actors, and their singing and acting have greatly helped the play and enhanced its artistic quality. Li Cuifang, who plays the town magistrate's wife, has few scenes, but her movements are accurate, her expressions are thoughtful, and her enunciation is particularly clear, truly "mature and typical," which is really rare. Li Feilong, who plays Zhang Yimin, performs very simply and honestly, without any unnecessary showing off, looking like an honest young man. But what is lacking is that the poem written on the kite is not good enough to explain Zhang Yimin's character. I don't know why he suddenly feels sentimental for a girl with a thin fate. It is not very appropriate to try to foreshadow Cuilian's life in advance. Of course, this is not the responsibility of the actors.
    "Searching the Academy," whether it is the playwright, director, or actors, is serious and conscientious from beginning to end. The performance, singing, and accompaniment music bring out the characteristics of Cantonese opera. There are new things in terms of tunes and accompaniment melodies. For example, Cuilian's "Bangzi Zhongban" has a new tune - it sounds very natural and pleasant, clean and without the drawbacks of being protracted. In the orchestral ensemble, the percussion instruments are added very harmoniously, which are all particularly worthy of our study.
    Cantonese opera and Beijing opera have the same origin. Its basic tunes are "Bangzi" (i.e., Xipi) and "Erhuang." Through the continuous efforts of Cantonese opera musicians, it has absorbed many local tunes from Guangdong, and the vocal music and accompaniment have undergone great changes, with many new creations. Since the adoption of "Pinghou," the singing style of Cantonese opera is closer to the Cantonese dialect than before, but it has not completely adopted the natural form of the spoken language. Not only is the melody quite strong in terms of singing, but also the dialogue, in many places, uses neat rhymed prose, clearly showing the musicality of the language. Also, due to the free use of various tunes, it has long broken the limitations of seven-character and ten-character sentences, and the "two-two-three" and "three-three-four" singing methods, freely using long and short sentences. In terms of music, it was initially a combination of various tunes, which gradually organically combined, blurring the traces of combination and showing the changes in modulation. This is also something that other opera genres do not have and is worth learning. The improvement of music in Cantonese opera, despite having taken many detours, does provide many places for us to learn and refer to. Cantonese opera is a local opera with a solid foundation and rich accumulation, and has a bright future for development. The most important issues at present are sorting out repertoires and organizing the creation of scripts. First of all, there must be some good scripts. I believe that the comrades of the Cantonese Opera Troupe have already noticed this. "Searching the Academy" is a good start, and in the future, they will achieve greater success.

    谈广东粤剧团演出的“搜书院”
    欧阳予倩
    “搜书院”是粤剧很受欢迎的传统剧目之一。广东粤剧团最近在首都演出这个戏，标志着粤剧改革的新气象，所有一切都和过去我在广州香港所看的某些广东戏大不相同，这个戏有明显的主题，看得出倾向，看得出爱憎。剧中正面人物谢宝的形象，非常生动真实。
    “搜书院”一开始就给我们以新颖的印象：镇台的小姐带着丫头翠莲在花园里放风筝，通过她们的舞蹈性极强的动作，观众就感觉风筝放起来了。她们放线、收线，前进后退、举手、翻身，表示风的时强时弱，风筝忽高忽低。她们一面放风筝一面唱小曲“双飞蝴蝶”。这是个美丽的场面。这种表演方面来自民间小戏，经过适当的加工便觉新颖有趣。扮演翠莲的红线女的演唱是十分动人的。
    谢宝踏月一场演得颇简洁而有风趣。马师曾演各种角色都有独到之处，尤其长于喜剧，他演谢宝这样的角色我还是第一次看见。他把谢宝塑造成一个慈祥和蔼、有学问、有正义感、持己严、待人宽，不畏强御而谈吐之间又富于幽默感的这样一位长者。我觉得这是对的。他的性格和他的行动是没有什么矛盾的。
    翠莲逃到书院同张逸民见面的一场，似乎简单一点。她和张逸民在找风筝的时候见过一面，张逸民最初没有认出她来，后来说穿了，翠莲对他说如果他收留她，愿以终身相托；如果他拒绝她，她就循迹空门。一个少女避难到一个年青人房里，恰好遇见她所想望的人，心情的激动可想而知。在张逸民事出意外，当然是十分惊讶，在这个时候，两个人的处境都很为难。张逸民想留她，有种种困难；不留她，她没去处；要告诉老师，有些不敢，她也不一定同意；最后为她的美丽、聪明、勇敢所动，也同情她不幸的遭遇，就决心把她留下。这些戏剧性的过程的描写和对这两个人物性格的刻划，都似乎还不够。
    搜书院一场，马师曾的表演是相当精彩的，但是我认为还可以更多的发展一些。可能是由于剧本的限制，演员还没能够充分发挥所长。戏的结尾部分也似乎略嫌草率，当时翠莲还并没有脱离危险，歌舞称庆似乎还早一些。
    这个戏，演员配备得很整齐，马师曾和红线女同是最有才能、受到广大群众欢迎的演员自不用说，其余有好几个角色戏虽不多，但都是第一流的演员，他们的唱做给了这个戏很大的帮助，加强了它的艺术性。演镇台夫人的李翠芳，戏虽不多，但动作准确，表情周到，唱白咬字特别清楚，真所谓“老成典型”，实在难得。还有扮演张逸民的李飞龙，表演得很朴实，没有什么多余的卖弄，看上去像一个诚实的青年。但令人感到不足的是题在风筝上的那首词不够好，不足以说明张逸民的性格，不知道他为什么忽然替薄命女儿感伤一番，要想预先为翠莲的身世作陪衬，也不很妥当。当然这是不能由演员来负责任的。
    “搜书院”无论编剧、导演、演员，从头到尾都是严肃认真的。表演、歌唱和伴奏音乐发挥了粤剧的特点。在腔调和伴奏的曲调方面都有新的东西。例如：翠莲所唱梆子中板就有新腔——听起来很自然，很好听，干干净净没有拖泥带水的弊病。在管弦合奏当中，打击乐器加得很谐和，这都是特别值得我们学习的地方。
    粤剧和京剧同源，它的基本曲调是梆子（即西皮）和二簧。经过粤剧音乐工作者不断的努力，吸收了许多广东当地的曲调，声腔和伴奏都起着很大的变化，有很多新的创造。自从改用平喉以来，粤剧的唱法比以前更多的接近广东口语，但是它并没有完全采取口语的自然形态，它不仅在唱的方面曲调性相当强，就是道白，有很多地方是用整齐的韵文，鲜明的显示着语言的音乐性。还有就是由于把各种曲调自由运用，就早已经打破了七字句十字句，二二三、三三四唱法的限制，很自由地使用着长短句。而在乐曲方面最初是各种曲调的凑合，逐渐有机地结合起来，就泯没了凑合的痕迹，显出转调的变化，这也是其他剧种所不如，值得我们学习的一点。粤剧对音乐的改进，尽管曾经走过不少弯路，但是供我们学习、参考的地方确是不少。粤剧是底子雄厚、积累丰富的地方剧种，有远大的发展前途。目前最重要的问题是整理剧目和组织剧本创作，首先要有些好剧本。相信粤剧团的同志早已注意到了，“搜书院”就是一个很好的开始，以后，也将会获得更大的成功。
