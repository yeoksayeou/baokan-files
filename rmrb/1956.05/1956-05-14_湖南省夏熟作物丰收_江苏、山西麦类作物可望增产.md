Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, May 13th: Hunan Province has reaped a bumper harvest of summer crops such as wheat.

According to the current harvesting situation in various areas of Hunan's 3.8 million mu of wheat, the yield per mu is generally more than 100 jin. Broad beans, peas, and other crops are also growing with full and dense pods, and harvesting has begun. More than 600,000 mu of spring potatoes across the province can also be harvested in a few days; according to reports from agricultural production cooperatives in various regions, the yield per mu will be at least 1,000 jin or more.

Currently, agricultural production cooperatives in various regions are formulating pre-distribution plans for summer harvest crops. In the pre-distribution of the Guangming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinshao County, Tian Guoqing, a member with the most workdays, received more than 1,500 jin of wheat, potatoes, and other crops; 148 members who originally had difficulty making a living also received sufficient rations.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, May 13th: Jiangsu Province's 50 million mu of wheat crops have thick stalks and large ears, and a bumper harvest is expected. According to estimates from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture, this year's yield may increase by about 20% compared to last year.

Barley and naked barley are about to be harvested, and wheat will also begin to be harvested in ten days. To welcome the first bumper harvest after agricultural cooperation, agricultural cooperatives in various regions have started preparations about twenty days earlier than in previous years. Female members are busy cleaning the warehouses where the new wheat will be stored, while male members are busy compacting the threshing grounds. Many cooperatives have also purchased sharp new sickles to deal with the wheat stalks that are more robust than in previous years.

This newspaper reports: Shanxi Province's more than 16 million mu of winter wheat is growing well and has begun to head. In the Jinan area, 11.15 million mu of winter wheat has already emerged, blossomed, and begun to grain fill. This is the best year for wheat growth in the Jinan area in nearly 20 years, and it is estimated that each mu can produce more than 130 jin, an increase of about one-tenth per mu compared to last year.

This year, Shanxi Province has had timely rainfall, and agricultural cooperatives in various regions have carried out wheat field management early. In the Changzhi Special District, 40% of the wheat fields have been top-dressed once or twice, and spring irrigation has been carried out in a timely manner for irrigated wheat in the Jinzhong area. Wheat pests have also been controlled, and shallow hoeing has been carried out in conjunction with pest control in 60% of the wheat fields. At present, agricultural cooperatives in various regions are actively preparing summer harvesting tools to welcome the first bumper harvest year after advanced cooperation.

    湖南省夏熟作物丰收
    江苏、山西麦类作物可望增产
    据新华社长沙13日电　湖南省小麦等夏熟作物丰收。
    湖南省三百八十多万亩小麦，据目前各地已经收割的情况看，每亩产量一般都有一百多斤。各地蚕豆、豌豆等也都长得荚密实满，已经开始收割。全省六十多万亩春马铃薯，再过几天也可收获；据各地农业生产合作社反映，每亩至少可收一千斤以上。
    现在，各地农业生产合作社正在制定夏收作物预分方案。新邵县光明农业生产合作社预分中，作劳动日最多的社员田国卿，获得了小麦、马铃薯等一千五百多斤；原来生活有困难的148户社员，也分到足够的口粮。
    新华社南京13日电　江苏省五千万亩麦类作物秆粗穗大，丰收有望。据江苏省农业厅估计，今年可能比去年增产二成左右。
    现在大麦和元麦眼见就要开镰，小麦也将在十天以后开始收割。为迎接农业合作化以后的第一次丰收，各地农业社的准备工作比往年提早二十天左右。女社员们忙着打扫将要储藏新麦的仓库，男社员们忙着夯实打麦场。许多社还选购锋利的新镰刀，用来对付比往年茁壮的麦秆。
    本报讯　山西省一千六百多万亩冬小麦生长良好并开始孕穗。晋南地区1，115万亩冬小麦，已经吐穗扬花开始结粒，这是晋南地区近20年来小麦生长最好的一年，预计每亩可产一百三十多斤，比去年每亩增产十分之一左右。
    今年山西省雨水适时，各地农业社都提早进行了麦田加工管理，长治专区40％的麦田进行了一至二次追肥，晋中地区水地小麦及时进行了春浇，并且还防治了小麦虫害，60％的麦田结合除虫进行了浅锄。目前，各地农业社正在积极准备夏收农具，迎接高级合作化后的第一个丰收年。
