Xinhua News Agency, Rome, May 27th: News from Rome: Nearly thirty million Italian voters began electing new local autonomous bodies across the majority of the country today. Voting will conclude by noon tomorrow. Among the nation's 7,934 towns and 90 provinces, 7,141 town municipal councils and 79 provincial councils are up for re-election. This election is considered a major event in Italian political life.

The Communist Party and the Socialist Party are maintaining their alliance in the election. They advocate for the unity of all democratic and republican forces to promote a leftward shift in the Italian situation through this election, in order to resolve pressing and important issues: revitalizing the economy, realizing the democratization of the political system, striving for Italian national independence, and striving for Italy's active participation in the cause of easing international tensions. Local organizations of the Communist Party, Socialist Party, and Social Democratic Party have put forward joint candidates in hundreds of towns in Lombardy.

The ruling Christian Democratic Party's leadership has rejected all suggestions from left-wing forces regarding cooperation in local autonomous bodies. It is campaigning with anti-communist slogans and general promises.

May 25th was the last day for campaigning activities. On this day, the General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Togliatti, delivered a speech at a rally initiated by the Communist Party in Rome, discussing the election situation. Togliatti told the 250,000 people attending the rally that although purely administrative and local issues were being debated during the campaign process, the overall policy issues were of paramount importance because this election was being held at a time of profound changes in the world, while Italy still had not adopted a new approach. Italy is the country that has suffered the most from the "Cold War." Trillions of lira have been spent on armaments. The unity of the democratic forces that saved Italy from fascism has been undermined, the constitution has not been implemented, and instead, attacks have been launched against communists and progressive forces among the people. The limited achievements made in some aspects of economic and social development have not significantly improved the living standards of the vast majority of working people. Italy has the lowest consumption rate among European countries. It is a country with the least expenditure on social welfare and social insurance, a country with the fewest hospitals, the fewest residential buildings, but the highest rents. At the same time, Italy's illiteracy and unemployment rates, and the number of slums in Rome, are among the highest in Europe.

Togliatti said that the demand for thorough reforms and changes in the current situation comes from all sectors of society—from factory workers, office workers, and farm workers. National life can be fundamentally reformed by implementing the democratic principles stipulated in the constitution. But to implement these principles, it is necessary to ensure that this election produces a new and powerful shift to the left, to limit the power of reactionary political and economic figures.

### 通过地方选举促使意大利局势向左转  意大利共产党和社会党保持联盟

    通过地方选举促使意大利局势向左转
    意大利共产党和社会党保持联盟
    新华社27日讯　罗马消息：意大利近三千万选民今天开始在全国绝大多数地方选举新的地方自治机构，投票将到明天中午结束，在全国七千九百三十四个市镇和九十个省中，这次要改选七千一百四十一个市镇的市政委员会和七十九个省的省政委员会。这次选举被认为是意大利政治生活里的一件大事。
    共产党和社会党在选举里保持着它们的联盟。它们主张一切民主和共和力量团结起来，通过这次选举促使意大利局势向左转，来解决切身重要的问题——复兴经济，实现政治制度民主化，争取意大利民族独立和争取使意大利积极参加缓和国际紧张局势的事业，共产党、社会党和社会民主党地方机构在伦巴第几百个市镇中提出了联合候选人。
    执政的天主教民主党领导机构拒绝了左翼力量关于在地方自治机构中进行合作的一切建议。它以反共口号和一般性诺言来进行竞选。
    五月二十五日是进行竞选活动的最后一天，意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂这一天在罗马举行的一次共产党发起的集会上发表演说，谈到这次的选举形势。陶里亚蒂向参加这次集会的二十五万人说，虽然在竞选过程中辩论的是纯行政性和地方性的问题，可是居于重要地位的是总的政策问题，因为这次选举是在世界上发生深刻的变化的时候举行的，而意大利仍然没有采取新的方针。意大利是受“冷战”之害最大的国家。在军备上花费了数以万亿计的里拉。拯救意大利摆脱法西斯主义的民主力量的团结遭到了破坏，宪法没有实行，反而向共产党人和人民中的进步力量展开了进攻。在经济和社会发展的某些方面取得的有限成就并没有使绝大多数劳动人民的生活水平发生显著的变化。意大利在欧洲国家中消费率最低。它是一个在社会福利和社会保险方面经费最少的国家，它是一个医院最少，住宅建筑最少，但是房租最高的国家。同时，意大利的文盲和失业人数，罗马的贫民窟的数目都为欧洲之冠。
    陶里亚蒂说，关于进行彻底的改革和改变目前的局势的要求来自社会各个阶层——来自工厂工人、机关工作人员和农场工人。国民生活可以通过实行宪法规定的民主原则而得到根本的改革。但是要实行这些原则，必须保证这次选举产生新的有力的向左的转变，来限制反动的政界和经济界人物的力量。
