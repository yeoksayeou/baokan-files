Enterprise Leading Cadres Urgently Request Reduction of Meetings
By Our Reporter Song Zheng

　　"Factory leading cadres are busy attending meetings all day long, unable to go deep into the workshops to conduct specific leadership. This is a major problem in the current enterprise leadership work. However, when newspapers raise this issue, they often only criticize factory leading cadres for their lack of in-depth work style, and their habit of relying on meetings for work... while rarely mentioning improvements in the leadership of higher-level organs. In fact, the factory leading cadres’ lack of in-depth work is greatly related to the excessive meetings of higher-level leading organs and the lack of planning in arranging tasks. Factory leading cadres spend a lot of time attending various meetings convened by various systems outside the factory. Attending meetings outside is not enough; they have to hold meetings again when they return—to discuss how to complete the work tasks assigned by higher-level organs, and the factory's meetings also increase accordingly." When I talked with the Shanghai Electric Motor Factory Party Committee Secretary about how to make the leadership work of industrial and mining enterprises more in-depth and specific during the high tide of industrial production, he frankly raised this issue. From what I understand, this is not an emphasis on objective difficulties or a rejection of newspaper criticism, but a pressing request from industrial and mining leading cadres to higher-level leading organs, asking them to help them get rid of endless meetings so that they have enough time to go deep into the workshops, understand the situation, study problems, and solve problems.

　　During his busiest time this spring, the Party Committee Secretary of the Shanghai Electric Motor Factory spent about half of each week going outside the factory to attend meetings. At its worst, he could only work in the factory for two days a week. The Youth League Secretary of this factory once had to spend four or five days a week attending outside meetings, so that the Youth League's staff often couldn't find the secretary to discuss issues, and they complained that the secretary was "not doing his job." The secretary of the Shanghai Huatong Switch Factory Party Committee was worried about the Party Committee Secretary's frequent absences to attend meetings. The secretary told the reporter: Because the Party Committee Secretary spends too much time going out to attend meetings and too little time in the factory, when he returns, there are many meetings waiting for him to preside over and attend, and many comrades are waiting to report on problems in their work. Although he is very willing to go down to the workshops more and have more contact with the masses, the remaining time is limited, making it difficult to actively go deep into the workshops to discover and solve problems. It is hard to believe that the Party Committee Secretary had so little time in the factory that he didn't even have time to read documents! The reporter wanted to talk to the Party Committee Secretary of Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 5 about some issues, and after agreeing on a time five times in a row, the meetings were canceled due to outside meetings. Of course, not being able to talk to the reporter as scheduled is not an important issue. But it can be seen that the Party Committee Secretary cannot control his time and cannot plan his work in a planned way, and the established work schedule is often disrupted by outside meetings.

　　Too many meetings are not a special situation in Shanghai alone. Song Jinsheng, Director of the Qiqihar Locomotive Factory, only worked in the factory for nearly twenty days in February and March, and spent the rest of the time attending meetings outside. In February, the leading cadres of the Shenyang Chemical Factory spent two-thirds of their time attending meetings in the city and in the factory.

　　To make leadership in-depth and specific, leaders must be given sufficient time. It is impossible to make the horse run without letting it eat grass. However, when some industrial and mining leading cadres raised this issue with the higher-level Party committee, the reply they received was: Isn't building socialism supposed to be a little busy! This means that meetings cannot be reduced.

　　It is true that building socialism is supposed to be a little busy. But we must also see how we are busy. If a large part of the time of the leading cadres of an industrial and mining enterprise is spent going to various leading organs to attend meetings, and they cannot conduct in-depth investigations and specific leadership of the work of the enterprise they lead, especially when industrial production is in a new upsurge, this kind of "busy" is not entirely beneficial to socialist construction. It is impossible to build socialism by relying on this kind of "busy." Therefore, this "busy" situation should be changed.

　　From the actual situation, not only should the meetings of leading organs be reduced, but they can also be reduced!

　　As the reporter knows, many meetings are repetitive. Recently, at the factory director meeting convened by the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, many factory directors raised this issue. Problems that have already been conveyed and studied at meetings in the city are again conveyed and studied at meetings in the province; or problems that have already been discussed at meetings in the province are repeatedly discussed at meetings in the city. Therefore, for some more important issues, industrial and mining leading cadres often have to listen to the same transmission three or four times or attend the same research meeting three or four times. Can't one or two of these repetitive meetings be reduced?

　　The leading organs that convene the meetings, regardless of whether it is necessary, always want the Party, government, labor union, Youth League, and even more leading cadres from the factory to attend the meetings together. For example, when the conscription work was arranged this spring, the competent authorities of Shanghai County wanted the Party Committee Secretary, Propaganda Committee Member, Organization Committee Member, Deputy Factory Director in charge of personnel work, Labor Union Chairman, and Youth League Secretary of the Shanghai Electric Motor Factory to attend the meeting together. Of course, conscription work is important, but is it really necessary for so many leading cadres to attend the meeting together to do this work well?

　　Since this spring, with the upsurge of industrial and agricultural production, all systems have plans for their work and have deployed their work to the lower levels. In addition to those directly related to production, the factory must also carry out worker cultural and technical education, intellectual work, the elimination of the four pests, Party supervision, etc. In some places, there are also adjustments to grain rations, prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis, etc. As a result, today this system wants the factory's leading cadres to attend a meeting to discuss overall planning issues, and tomorrow that system asks the leading cadres to attend a meeting to deploy work, and the Party Committee Secretary, Factory Director, and other leading cadres have to live in meetings.

　　Of course, leading organs have their own reasons for doing so. They all feel that their work is important and are willing to directly assign the work of their departments to the Party Committee Secretary and the Factory Director. If you sit in your own leading organ, inviting the Factory Director and Party Committee Secretary to attend one or two meetings will not hinder the work of the factory too much. However, they have not thought about such a simple fact: factories and mines are the basic units for our socialist construction, and many tasks directly and indirectly related to production must be carried out here. Leading organs each have their own division of labor and emphasize the importance of their work. Dozens of hands are stretched to the industrial and mining enterprises at the same time, and the leading cadres in the industrial and mining enterprises cannot cope with it. Listen to the talk of the Party Committee Secretary of the Fushun Longfeng Mine: The responsible comrades of the Municipal Party Committee are in charge of one front each, and the leading comrades of several fronts often convene meetings at the same time, and the Party Committee Secretary is required to attend several meetings. Of course, the Party Committee Secretary cannot attend all of them, but if he does not attend, he will be criticized, so he has to use the method of "asking for sick leave" to cope with it. It is said that at the time of the most meetings, the Party Committee Secretary could only spend one day a week at the mine. Obviously, in this case, although these tasks are very important, they are difficult to do well.

　　There are also some problems that do not require meetings at all. The leading organ can solve them by issuing an instruction or a notice, but they still have to hold a meeting. At the same time, some meetings are not well prepared in advance, and the meeting time is too long. Some meetings are only related to a few units, but the organs that convene the meetings indiscriminately invite many industrial and mining leading cadres to attend the meetings. … These "burdens" should be lifted.

　　The fact is very clear. If the leading organs, especially the provincial and municipal Party committees, do not simply require the cadres below to work in depth, but can often understand the specific situation of industrial and mining work, they will feel that the problem of too many meetings has reached the point where it must be solved. Of course, it is useless to only admit that the problem should be solved without taking the necessary measures. This is the case with some local Party committees now, and as a result, this problem is becoming more and more serious. The local Party committee has the full power and responsibility to effectively solve this problem. The local Party committee should control and deploy the work required by various systems in a unified way according to the priority and urgency, and the local Party committee should also be determined to change its leadership style, often go deep into the grassroots to understand the situation, check the work, and help solve the problems, instead of always calling the cadres below to attend meetings to report. In this way, the burden of industrial and mining leading cadres can be greatly reduced, and they will be able to make their leadership work in-depth and specific.

　　企业领导干部迫切要求减少会议
　　本报记者  宋琤
    “工厂领导干部成天忙于开会，不能深入车间进行具体领导，这是目前企业领导工作中的一大问题。可是，报纸在提出这个问题的时候，常常只是批评工厂的领导干部作风不深入，习惯于靠会议进行工作……，而很少提到改进上级机关领导的问题。事实上，工厂领导干部的工作不深入，和上级领导机关会议过多、布置任务缺乏计划性有很大关系。工厂领导干部有很多时间都花在参加外面各个系统召开的各种各样的会议上面。外面开了会还不算，回来还得再开——讨论怎样完成上级机关布置下来的工作任务，厂里的会议也就跟着增加。”当我和上海电机厂党委书记谈到在工业生产高潮中，怎样使工矿的领导工作更深入更具体的时候，他就直率地提出了这个问题。从我所了解的情况来看，这不是强调客观困难，拒绝报纸批评，而是工矿领导干部向上级领导机关提出了一个迫切要求，要求上级领导机关帮助他们从无休止的会议中解脱出来，好有充分时间深入车间，了解情况，研究问题，解决问题。
    上海电机厂的党委书记今年春天最忙的时候，每周约有一半的时间到工厂外面去参加会议，最严重的时候，每周只能有两天时间在工厂工作。这个工厂的团委书记，曾有一个时期几乎每周都有四五天的时间要参加外面的会议，以至团组织的工作人员经常找不到书记商量问题，他们埋怨书记“不务正业”。上海华通开关厂党委会的秘书为党委书记经常外出开会而忧虑。这个秘书告诉记者：因为党委书记出去开会的时间太多，在厂的时间太少，一回来，就有好多会议等着他去主持和参加，好多同志等着向他汇报工作中的问题。他自己虽然很愿意多下车间、多和群众接触，但是剩下的时间毕竟不多了，很难做到经常主动地深入车间去发现问题解决问题。说来很难令人相信，这位党委书记因为在工厂的时间太少，弄得连看文件的时间都没有了！记者要找上海国棉五厂的党委书记谈一些问题，一连五次约定了时间，都因为外面的会议而没有谈成。不能如约和记者谈话，当然不是什么重要问题。但是可以看出这样一个问题：党委书记不能掌握自己的时间，不能有计划地安排自己的工作，既定的工作日程经常被外面的会议打乱。
    会议太多并不是上海一个地方的特殊情况。齐齐哈尔机车厂厂长宋金声在今年二、三两个月中，只在厂里工作了近二十天，其余的时间，全是在外面开会。沈阳化工厂的领导干部，二月份，参加市内和厂内会议的时间，占全月时间的三分之二。
    要领导深入具体，就得给领导干部以比较充分的时间。又要马儿跑，又要马儿不吃草，这是不可能的。可是有些工矿的领导干部向上级党委提出这个问题，得到的答复是：建设社会主义么，是要忙一点！这就是说，会议不能减少。
    建设社会主义是要忙一点，这是对的。但是还要看怎样忙法？一个工矿的领导干部如果大部分时间忙于到各个领导机关开会，而不能对自己所领导的企业的工作进行深入的调查研究和具体的领导，特别是在工业生产处于新的高涨的情况下，这种“忙”对社会主义建设就不是完全有利的。靠这种“忙”，也是建设不起社会主义来的。因此这种“忙”的状况就应该改变。
    从实际情况来看，领导机关的会议不但应该减少，而且也是可以减少的！
    据记者知道，有很多的会议是重复的。最近，在第一机械工业部召开的厂长会议上，很多厂长都提出了这个问题。市里已经开会传达研究了的问题，省里又开会传达研究；或者省里已经开会讨论过的问题，市里还要开会重复讨论。因此，比较重要一些的问题，工矿的领导干部往往要听三、四次同样的传达或参加三、四次同样的研究会议。这些重复的会议，难道不能减少个把吗？
    召开会议的领导机关，不管是否有必要，总是要厂里党、政、工、团甚至更多的领导干部一齐参加会议。比如，今年春天布置征兵工作的时候，上海县的主管机关就要上海电机厂的党委书记、宣传委员、组织委员、管人事工作的副厂长、工会主席、团委书记六个人一起去开会。征兵工作当然是重要的，可是，难道非要这么多的领导干部一起去开会才能做好这一工作吗？
    今春以来，随着工、农业生产的高涨，各个系统的工作都有了规划，都分别向下边部署工作。除直接有关生产的以外，工厂里要进行的，还有职工文化技术教育、知识分子工作、除四害、党的监察工作等等，有的地方还有调整粮食定量工作、防治血吸虫病等。于是，今天这个系统要工厂领导干部去开会讨论全面规划问题、明天那个系统找领导干部去开会部署工作，党委书记、厂长等领导干部就不得不生活在会议中了。
    领导机关所以这样做，当然也有他们自己的道理。他们都觉得自己的工作重要，都愿意把自己部门的工作直接布置给党委书记和厂长。如果坐在自己的领导机关来看，找厂长、党委书记来开上一两次会，对工厂的工作也不至于有多大妨碍。可是，他们没有想到这么一个简单的事实：工厂矿山是我们进行社会主义建设的基层单位，许许多多直接有关和间接有关生产的工作都要集中在这里进行。领导机关各自有各自的分工，各自强调自己的工作重要，几十只手一齐伸向工矿，工矿里的领导干部就招架不住了。请听一下抚顺龙凤矿党委书记的谈话：市委的负责同志一个人管一条战线，常常几条战线的领导同志同时召开会议，几个会议都要党委书记参加。党委书记当然不能都出席，可是不出席又要受批评，于是只好用“请病假”的办法应付过去。据说，会议最多的时候，这个党委书记每周只能有一天时间在矿上。很明显的，在这种情况下，虽然这些工作都是很重要的，但都难以做好。
    也还有一些问题根本用不着开会，领导机关发个指示或发个通知就可以解决了，可是也要开会。同时，有些会议事前准备得不好，会议时间拖得太长。有些会议只和少数单位有关，但是召集开会的机关却不加区别地把很多工矿领导干部都找来开会。……这些“负担”都是应该解除的。
    事实是很清楚的，领导机关特别是党的省市委，如果不是只简单地要求下面的干部工作要深入，而能够经常地了解工矿工作的具体状况，他们就会感到会议多的问题已经到了必须解决的时候了。当然，仅只承认问题应该解决，而不去采取必要的措施，也还是无补于事的。现在有些地方党委就是这样，结果这个问题越来越严重。地方党委完全有权力也有责任来有效地解决这个问题。地方党委应该分别轻重缓急统一控制和部署各系统要求工矿进行的工作，地方党委同时应该下决心改变自己的领导作风，经常深入基层了解情况，检查工作，帮助解决问题，而不要总是把下面的干部找来开会汇报。这样，工矿领导干部的负担就可以减轻很多，他们就有可能使自己的领导工作深入具体。
