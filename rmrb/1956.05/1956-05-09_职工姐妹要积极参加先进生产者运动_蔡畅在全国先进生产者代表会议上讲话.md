Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, called on female workers across the country at the National Conference of Advanced Producers on the 8th to participate in the advanced producer movement with greater enthusiasm.

She said that it is encouraging that in the nationwide advanced producer movement, our vast numbers of female workers, like their male counterparts, have enthusiastically engaged in socialist competition with a high degree of labor enthusiasm. In various work positions, a large number of advanced female producers and advanced female workers have emerged. Their hard work has played a positive role in accelerating socialist construction; they are advanced role models for women in our country.

Cai Chang said that in the high tide of socialist construction, the broad masses of workers' families have also unprecedentedly enhanced their socialist enthusiasm. In order to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, they have actively and consciously taken action to cooperate with workers in carrying out socialist competition and vigorously support the advanced producer movement. Cai Chang requested that all workers' families actively carry out "five-good" work to better help their husbands and relatives successfully complete the national plan.

Cai Chang expressed her hope that trade unions at all levels and production leaders will continue to implement the principle of "mobilizing both men and women together" in the advanced producer movement, overcome views that discriminate against and belittle women, so that female workers, female staff members, and workers' families can receive education, help, and support in the advanced producer movement just like male workers and male staff members. She said that especially because female workers bear another social obligation, they have to give birth to and raise children, and they have to handle household chores, so the difficulties they encounter on their way forward will be more than those of men. This makes it all the more necessary to care for their difficulties, help them overcome difficulties, and encourage and support them to move forward continuously. When improving the cultural and technical level of workers and developing labor welfare undertakings, it is necessary to listen to the opinions of female workers and workers' families and fully care for the lives and welfare of women and children. Only in this way can we inspire them to more actively participate in the advanced producer movement.

　　职工姐妹要积极参加先进生产者运动
    蔡畅在全国先进生产者代表会议上讲话
    中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅，八日在全国先进生产者代表会议上号召全国职工姐妹要以更高的积极性参加先进生产者运动。
    她说，值得我们欢欣鼓舞的是：在全国性的先进生产者运动中，我们广大女职工和男职工一样，以高度的劳动热情，积极地投入了社会主义竞赛。在各种不同的工作岗位上，都涌现出大量的女先进生产者和女先进工作者。她们的辛勤劳动，对加快社会主义建设起了积极作用；她们是我国妇女的先进榜样。
    蔡畅说，在社会主义建设的高潮中，广大职工家属也空前地提高了社会主义积极性。她们为了提前完成第一个五年计划，积极地自觉地行动起来，配合职工开展社会主义竞赛，大力支援了先进生产者运动。蔡畅要求所有职工家属要积极展开“五好”工作，更好地帮助自己的丈夫和亲人出色地完成国家计划。
    蔡畅希望各级工会和生产领导者在先进生产者运动中，要继续贯彻“男女一齐发动”的方针，克服歧视和轻视妇女的观点，使女工、女职员、职工家属们能和男工、男职员一样，在先进生产者运动中受到教育、帮助和支持。她说，特别是因为女职工担负着另一种社会的义务，她们要生育和教养孩子，她们要处理家务，因此在她们前进道路上所遇到的困难，会比男人更多一些。这就更需要关怀她们的困难，帮助她们克服困难，鼓励和支持她们不断前进。在提高职工文化和技术水平和发展劳动者福利事业的时候，都必须倾听女职工、职工家属们的意见，充分关心妇女儿童的生活福利。只有这样，才能启发她们更加积极地投入先进生产者运动。
