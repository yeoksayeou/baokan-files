    Dad, why haven't you come back yet?
    (A Child's Thoughts on the Eve of "June 1st" Children's Day)
    Yuan Ying
    Some children go to the park for team activities, some children go shopping with their parents; I greet you across the Pacific Ocean, Dad, why haven't you come back yet? We are happy all day and all month, but we feel sad whenever we think of you. Nine calendars on the wall have been changed, why haven't you been able to come back? The pomegranate tree you planted in the yard has long grown tall and big; Mom picks its first red flower every year to commemorate you. When you left home, I was only three years old, and now I am about to become a middle school student; even your youngest son, whom you haven't even met, joined the Young Pioneers last month. One day, some guests came to see Mom, and my younger brother said, "Dad is coming back by plane." When the guests laughed, I saw Mom secretly wiping away tears. Mom has a lot more gray hair and several more wrinkles on her face. Many times I wake up in the middle of the night and always see her staring blankly at your photo. Mom reads us your letter from last year, which said: your heart is set on returning home. We have waited for you month after month, why is your shadow always so far away? If I had wings, I would really like to fly to Geneva to ask the American ambassador why he won't let you go home? I want to ask the U.S. State Department: you keep talking about humanity and keeping your word, but you are holding my father and not letting him go, what kind of bad intentions do you really have? You pretend to be good people on the surface, who knows what you are doing secretly? You have said all the nice things, don't you know what shame is? Dad, your son is calling for you, your relatives, your motherland are calling for you. No matter how cunning the American government is, we must bring you back!
        Late May 1956, Beijing.

    爸爸，你为什么还不回来？
    （“六一”儿童节前夕，一个孩子心里的话）
    袁鹰有的孩子到公园里去过队日，有的孩子跟爸爸妈妈去逛大街；我隔着太平洋问候你，爸爸，你为什么还不回来？我们整天整月过得很快活，可是一想起你，就会悲哀。墙上的日历换了九本了，你为什么还不能够回来？院子里你亲手栽的石榴树，早就长得又高又大；妈妈为了纪念你，每年要摘下它的第一朵红花。你离开家的时候，我才三岁，如今我马上就要成为中学生；就连你还没见过的弟弟，上个月也带上了红领巾。有一天，有些客人来看妈妈，弟弟说：“爸爸就要坐飞机回来。”当客人们哈哈大笑的时候，我看见妈妈悄悄地在擦眼泪。妈妈的头上添了不少白发，脸上也添了好几道皱纹，好多回我在半夜醒来，总见她对着你的照片发楞。妈妈给我们念你去年的信，信上说：你归心似箭。我们等了你一个月又一个月，你的影子为什么总是那样遥远？要是我有翅膀，我真想一下子飞到日内瓦，去问问那个美国大使，为什么不放你回家？我要问问美国国务院：你们口口声声说什么人道和守信，可是你们扣住我的爸爸不放，到底是安着什么样的坏心？你们表面上装作好人，谁知道暗地里干些什么事？你们嘴上说尽了好话，难道就不知道什么叫羞耻？爸爸，你的儿子在呼唤你，你的亲人，你的祖国在呼唤你，不管美国政府怎样狡赖，我们一定要把你要回来！
