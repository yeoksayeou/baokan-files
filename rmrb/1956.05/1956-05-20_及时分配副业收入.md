    Timely Distribution of Sideline Income
    The Meishan Agricultural Producers' Cooperative of Ji'an Township, Longyan County, Fujian Province, has earned over 16,000 yuan from sideline production in the past four months. 75% of this income has been promptly distributed to cooperative members as advance payments for daily living expenses.
    Sideline income has historically accounted for about half of the total income of farmers in Ji'an Township. After more than 500 farming households in this township established a large-scale agricultural cooperative at the beginning of this year, they made comprehensive arrangements for the development of agricultural and sideline production throughout the cooperative. They organized cooperative members with special technical skills into a sideline production team. They utilized both major and minor agricultural slack seasons to engage in a variety of sideline productions, and paid attention to establishing reasonable piece-rate remuneration methods according to each person's different skills and different sideline production projects.

    及时分配副业收入
    福建省龙岩县集安乡美山农业生产合作社在最近四个月内，经营副业生产进款已达一万六千多元，其中75％已及时预支给社员作为日常生活费用。
    集安乡历来副业收入占农民总收入的一半左右。这个乡的五百多户农民在今年初办起一个大型农业社后，对全社发展农副业生产作了全面安排，把社内有技术特长的社员组成一支副业生产队。他们利用大小农闲时间，经营多种副业生产，并注意按各人不同技术和不同的副业生产项目，规定了合理的计工报酬办法。（据新华社讯）
