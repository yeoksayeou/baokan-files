Strengthening Preparatory Work for the Construction of New Industrial Zones and New Industrial Cities
Zhang Zhenhe, Director of the Regional Planning Division of the Regional Planning Bureau of the State Construction Commission

With the progress of China's socialist industrial construction, many new industrial zones and new industrial cities are growing. As the scale of industrial construction will be further expanded in the future, and the distribution of industry will be further balanced, more new industrial zones will be opened up and more new industrial cities will be built on China's vast territory during the Second Five-Year Plan period. The general characteristics of the construction of new industrial zones and new industrial cities are: First, many large-scale industrial enterprises are built simultaneously, so many problems during the construction period need to be arranged in a unified manner; second, most of them are located in areas where there was no industry or where the industrial and urban foundations were very weak, so power supply, water supply, transportation, cultural and welfare facilities, and various enterprises serving basic construction and production, all need to be built from scratch; third, the construction time is very tight. These characteristics indicate that the preparatory work for the construction of new industrial zones and new industrial cities is very complex and arduous. From selecting factory sites, organizing survey and mapping work, formulating urban plans, deploying off-site engineering, arranging construction bases and local building materials, to carrying out construction, any link that is not done well is enough to seriously affect the progress of industrial construction, so that the country's construction plans cannot be completed on time, or cause major economic waste. Therefore, doing a good job in the preparatory work for the construction of new industrial zones and new industrial cities in a timely manner is an important condition for ensuring the smooth progress of industrial construction.

In the past few years, many important measures have been taken for the construction of new industrial zones and new industrial cities, which have basically ensured the smooth progress of industrial construction. However, due to many subjective and objective reasons, there are also phenomena of insufficient preparation, such as: failure to carry out regional planning work, and the various constructions of new industrial zones and new industrial cities cannot be comprehensively and reasonably coordinated around industrial construction; the organization of survey and mapping work is not good enough, and cannot fully meet the needs in terms of time and quality; there are still many shortcomings in urban planning; there are still many problems to be solved in the division of labor and cooperation in off-site engineering construction; the planning of construction bases has not yet been carried out, etc. These problems have more or less adverse effects on industrial construction with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. According to the expansion of the scale and speed of industrial construction and the increase in the number of new industrial zones during the Second Five-Year Plan, in order to ensure the needs of industrial construction, we must regard the preparatory work for the construction of new industrial zones and new industrial cities as one of the main tasks in preparing for the Second Five-Year Plan, and effectively improve and strengthen it based on past experience.

How to improve and strengthen the preparatory work for the construction of new industrial zones and new industrial cities?

(1) Speed up the selection of factory sites. The speed and quality of industrial construction, construction costs, and the cost of products after production are closely related to the correct selection of factory sites. If the factory site is not determined, not only will it be impossible to start the design of the industrial enterprise itself, but also the various preparatory work for the construction of new industrial zones and new industrial cities will be difficult to carry out. Therefore, the work of selecting factory sites for the important industrial enterprises to be built during the Second Five-Year Plan should be vigorously carried out, and efforts should be made to roughly determine the factory sites of these important industrial enterprises in 1956, so that the construction of new industrial zones and new industrial cities can be prepared as early as possible.

The selection of factory sites can be carried out separately by the competent departments of individual enterprises, or it can be jointly organized by the competent departments of several enterprises to be built in the same area. Jointly selecting factory sites takes into account more comprehensive issues than selecting factory sites alone, and it is easier to solve the coordination problems between enterprises; selecting factory sites alone should also have a comprehensive perspective, consider the coordination with other enterprises, and avoid conflicts. At the same time, the selection of factory sites should also invite urban construction departments, transportation departments, health departments and other relevant departments to participate in assisting, so as to solve the relevant coordination and cooperation problems in a timely manner.

(2) Actively carry out regional planning work. Regional planning is a comprehensive plan for the construction of industrial, urban, power, transportation, water conservancy, agriculture, forestry, as well as water supply, drainage and other engineering facilities in the area where several new industrial zones and new industrial cities will be built, based on the national economic development plan and the local natural and economic conditions, in order to reasonably arrange industry and unify the coordination between industrial construction, urban construction and other engineering constructions in the same area. Regional planning can coordinate the selection of factory sites, the formulation of urban plans, the deployment of off-site engineering, the arrangement of regional power grids, and the planning of construction bases, so as to avoid conflicts, so that these tasks can be done faster and better.

Regional planning is a comprehensive task. First of all, a comprehensive survey should be conducted on the natural conditions, economic conditions and construction conditions in the planning area, the conditions for deploying industries in the area should be studied, the planned industrial projects should be determined, and industrial and urban layout plans should be made; then, professional planning should be carried out for transportation systems, power supply systems, water supply and drainage, construction bases, water conservancy and agriculture, afforestation, etc.; finally, a draft regional plan should be comprehensively prepared. In order to do a good job in regional planning, relevant industrial departments, urban construction departments, transportation departments, postal and telecommunications departments, water conservancy departments, agricultural departments, forestry departments, health departments and relevant scientific research institutions need to strongly support, actively participate, and under the unified leadership and deployment of the competent departments, undertake various planning tasks and assist in solving certain major problems.

(3) Strengthen urban planning work. New industrial cities and workers' towns should select residential areas at the same time as selecting factory sites, determine the scale of urban development, and make plans before various engineering constructions, reasonably arrange industrial enterprises, transportation, housing, public buildings, water supply, drainage, roads, greening and other various projects in the city, in order to carry out construction in a planned manner.

In order to make urban planning adapt to the urgent needs of current construction, the procedures for compiling urban plans should be appropriately improved: after the general outline of the city is determined, efforts should be concentrated on detailed planning for the current construction area, changing the practice of spending too much effort on long-term planning and neglecting short-term planning. In urban planning, attention should also be paid to preventing the bias of unilaterally pursuing the beauty of the city and neglecting economy and applicability.

(4) Uniformly arrange off-site engineering. Off-site engineering includes water supply, drainage, power supply, heating supply, railway special lines, telecommunications, roads, flood control and other projects for industrial enterprises. If any of these projects cannot meet the needs of industrial construction, it will affect the progress of industrial construction, and even if the factory is completed on time, it will not be able to put into production. The key to doing a good job in off-site engineering construction lies in timely solving the coordination and cooperation problems in construction, that is to say: before the off-site engineering design, the construction principles, construction progress, and design entrustment of various projects should be comprehensively arranged; during the design, the comprehensive work of various engineering designs should be closely carried out, and the contradictions between various designs should be discovered and resolved in a timely manner to ensure the progress and quality of the design; in the construction preparation stage, the construction sites, construction procedures, local materials, and common processing plants and prefabrication plants of various projects should be uniformly arranged to avoid mutual interference during construction and ensure the progress and quality of construction.

In order to do a good job in off-site engineering construction, the division of labor and mutual relations between various departments in off-site engineering investment, design and construction should also be gradually clearly stipulated to avoid the phenomenon of mutual buck-passing and no one being responsible. First of all, the investment method of off-site engineering should be appropriately improved, and efforts should be made to have all or major projects uniformly invested by one department, so as to avoid difficulties caused by the division of investment by various departments. Secondly, for each new industrial zone, designate the competent department of a major enterprise as the general Party A, responsible for compiling the off-site engineering. At the same time, in order to do a good job in the task statement, provide design data, and inspect the progress and quality of design and construction, it should also be considered to establish a general Party B for design and construction, or establish a general planning department for design and construction, so that various projects can closely cooperate in design and construction.

(5) Do a good job in the planning of construction bases. Construction base planning is an important part of the preparatory work for the construction of new industrial zones. In areas with a large number of industrial construction projects and a long construction period, the construction quantity, scale, time and steps of various prefabrication plants and processing plants, technical supply and storage warehouses, and mechanical repair enterprises, the supply of local building materials, and the construction of cultural and welfare facilities for construction workers should be comprehensively arranged according to the recent and long-term distribution of industry, the needs of construction projects, and the specific local conditions. Doing a good job in the planning of construction bases can avoid chaos such as blindness, repeated waste, etc. in base construction.

(6) Conduct survey and mapping work in an organized manner. Regional planning, urban planning, and the design of various projects inside and outside the factory require a large amount of basic data, and survey and mapping work has a decisive impact on the speed and quality of planning and design work. In the past, the survey and mapping work carried out by various departments in the same area lacked unified organization, so that on the one hand, the technical force of survey and mapping was insufficient, and on the other hand, various departments were doing a lot of repetitive work. This not only wasted manpower and materials, but also made it difficult to ensure progress and quality. In order to complete the more arduous task of survey and mapping in the future, the survey and mapping work that can be carried out uniformly in the same area, such as topographic surveying, engineering geology, and underground water source exploration required for selecting factory sites, urban planning, and preliminary factory design, should be organized by a main responsible department to unite the relevant units and carry out the work with a division of labor. Even for work that cannot be organized uniformly, the various units should cooperate with each other in the work and strive for unity in technical specifications, so as to avoid the survey and mapping data of the various units from contradicting each other and affecting the quality of the design.

The above-mentioned series of tasks are all important measures to strengthen the preparatory work for the construction of new industrial zones and new industrial cities. In order to ensure the realization of these measures, the leading organs in charge of construction need to vigorously organize the preparatory work for the construction of new industrial zones and new industrial cities, gradually formulate necessary rules and regulations, regularly check the work, and solve problems. It is necessary for the central and local industrial departments, urban construction departments, transportation departments, and all other relevant departments to assume the responsibilities that should be assumed in these tasks, and under the unified leadership of the local Party committees and people's committees, take the initiative to cooperate, assist each other, and jointly do a good job in the preparatory work for the construction of new industrial zones and new industrial cities. The preparatory work for the construction of new industrial zones and new industrial cities especially requires the local Party committees and people's committees to strengthen leadership, unify and arrange the work carried out by the relevant units under the central departments and the local units in the same area, and regularly supervise and inspect and solve the problems that occur in the work. The Party committees and people's committees of provinces (autonomous regions) and cities have the responsibility to resolve disputes in a timely manner or reflect opinions to the central competent authorities on problems arising in the coordination and cooperation among the construction units, between Party A and Party B, between the industrial departments and the urban construction departments, and between other departments, so as to avoid delays and delay the progress of construction.

In order to do a good job in the preparatory work for the construction of new industrial zones and new industrial cities, it is also necessary to establish and strengthen the corresponding survey and design institutions. Such as design institutions responsible for regional planning and urban planning, design institutions responsible for engineering design such as water supply, drainage, power supply, heating supply, and industrial transportation, and survey and mapping institutions responsible for engineering geology, hydrogeological exploration and topographic surveying, etc., need to be established if they did not exist before, and need to be improved if they existed before but are not adapted to the tasks.

    加强新工业区和新工业城市建设的准备工作
    国家建设委员会区域规划局区域规划处处长　张振和
    随着我国社会主义工业建设的进展，许多新工业区和新工业城市正在成长。由于今后工业建设的规模将更加扩大，工业的分布将进一步均衡，在第二个五年计划期间，在我国辽阔的国土上，将要开辟更多的新工业区，建设更多的新工业城市。新工业区和新工业城市建设工作的一般特点是：第一，同时兴建许多规模巨大的工业企业，因而建设期间的许多问题都需要统一安排；第二，大多数都处在原来没有工业或者工业基础和城市基础非常薄弱的地区，因而供电、供水、交通、文化福利设施以及为基本建设和生产服务的各种企业，都需要从头建起；第三，建设时间非常紧迫。这些特点说明，新工业区和新工业城市建设的准备工作是十分复杂和繁重的。从选择厂址，组织勘察测量工作，制定城市规划，部署厂外工程，安排建筑基地和地方建筑材料，一直到进行施工，任何一个环节的工作作得不好，都足以严重影响工业建设的进度，使国家的建设计划不能按时完成，或者在经济上造成重大的浪费。因此，适时作好新工业区和新工业城市建设的准备工作，是保证工业建设顺利进行的一个重要条件。
    过去几年，对于新工业区和新工业城市的建设，曾经采取了许多重要措施，基本上保证了工业建设的顺利进行。但是，由于许多主观和客观的原因，准备工作不够的现象也是有的，如：没有开展区域规划工作，新工业区和新工业城市的各项建设还不能围绕工业建设进行全面的合理的配合；勘察测量工作组织得不够好，在时间上和质量上不能完全满足需要；城市规划工作中还有许多缺点；厂外工程建设的分工、协作中还有许多尚待解决的问题；建筑基地规划工作还没有进行等。这些问题，对于又多、又快、又好、又省地进行工业建设，都或多或少地有某些不利的影响。根据第二个五年计划工业建设规模扩大，速度加快和新工业区增多的情况，为了保证工业建设的需要，必须把新工业区和新工业城市建设的准备工作，作为当前准备第二个五年计划的主要工作之一，并且根据以往经验，切实予以改进和加强。
    怎样改进和加强新工业区和新工业城市建设的准备工作呢？
    （一）加紧进行厂址的选择工作。工业建设的速度、质量、建设费用和开工生产后的产品成本，同厂址的正确选择有很大关系。厂址不定，不仅无法开始工业企业本身的设计，而且新工业区和新工业城市建设的各项准备工作都很难进行。因此，对于第二个五年计划期内将要建设的重要工业企业的厂址选择工作应该大力进行，争取在1956年内把这些重要工业企业的厂址大体上确定下来，以便新工业区和新工业城市的建设工作能及早进行准备。
    厂址的选择，可以由个别企业的主管部门单独进行个别企业的厂址选择，也可以由拟在同一地区建设的若干企业的各主管部门组织联合选择厂址。联合选择厂址较之单独选择厂址考虑问题更全面，便于解决各企业之间的配合问题；单独选择厂址，也应当具有全面的观点，考虑和其它企业的配合，避免发生矛盾。同时，选择厂址还应当请城市建设部门、交通运输部门、卫生部门和其它有关部门参加协助，以便及时解决有关的配合、协作问题。
    （二）积极开展区域规划工作。区域规划，就是对于将要建设若干新工业区和新工业城市的地区，根据国民经济的发展计划和当地的自然条件和经济条件，对工业、城镇、动力、交通运输、水利、农业、林业以及供水、排水等各项工程设施的建设，进行全面规划，以便合理布置工业，统一安排同一地区内工业建设、城市建设和其它工程建设相互之间的配合问题。区域规划可以使选择厂址、制定城市规划，部署厂外工程、安排区域性的供电网以及规划建筑基地等工作互相配合，避免矛盾，以便把这些工作做得更快和更好。
    区域规划是一件综合性的工作。首先，要对规划区域内的自然条件、经济条件和建筑施工条件进行综合调查，研究区域内布置工业的条件，确定拟建的工业项目，并且作出工业和城镇的布置方案；然后，分别进行交通运输系统、动力供应系统、供水排水、建筑基地、水利和农业、造林等专业的规划；最后，综合编制出区域规划草案。为了把区域规划工作做好，需要有关的工业部门、城市建设部门、交通运输部门、邮电部门、水利部门、农业部门、林业部门、卫生部门和有关的科学研究机关大力支持，积极参加，在主管部门的统一领导和部署之下，分别承担各项规划任务和协助解决某些重大问题。
    （三）加强城市规划工作。新建的工业城市和工人镇，应当在选择厂址的同时选定住宅区，确定城市的发展规模，并且在各种工程建设之前做好规划，合理布置城市中的工业企业、交通运输、住宅、公共建筑、供水、排水、道路、绿化以及其它各种工程，以便有计划地进行建设。
    为使城市规划适应当前建设的紧迫需要，应当适当改进城市规划的编制程序：在城市的大致轮廓确定之后，应当集中力量进行当前建设地区的详细规划，改变在远期规划上花费力量太多而忽视近期规划的作法。在城市规划中也应当注意防止片面追求市容美观而忽视经济、适用的偏向。
    （四）统一安排厂外工程。厂外工程包括工业企业的供水、排水、供电、供热、铁路专用线、电讯以及道路、防洪等工程。这些工程中的任何一项不能适应工业建设的需要，都会影响工业建设的进度，就是工厂按时建成了，也无法投入生产。做好厂外工程建设的关键在于及时解决建设中的配合协作问题，就是说：在厂外工程设计之前，要全面安排各项工程的建设原则、建设进度以及设计委托等问题；在设计当中，要抓紧进行各项工程设计的综合工作，及时发现和解决各项设计之间的矛盾，以保证设计的进度和质量；在施工准备阶段，要统一安排各项工程的施工场地、施工程序、地方材料以及共同性的加工厂、预制厂等，以避免施工中的互相干扰，保证施工的进度和质量。
    为了做好厂外工程的建设工作，还应当把各部门在厂外工程投资、设计和施工中的分工以及相互关系，逐步作出明确规定，以避免发生互相推诿，无人负责的现象。首先，应当适当改进厂外工程的投资办法，尽可能做到全部或主要工程由一个部门统一投资，以免由于各部门分摊投资而造成困难。其次，就每个新工业区指定一个主要企业的主管部门担任总甲方，负责编制厂外工程，同时为了做好计划任务书，提供设计资料，检查设计和施工的进度和质量设计，也应当考虑建立设计和施工的总乙方，或者建立设计和施工的总规划部门，以便使各项工程在设计和施工中能够密切配合。
    （五）做好建筑基地的规划工作。建筑基地规划是新工业区建设准备工作的重要环节。在工业建设项目较多、建设年限较长的地区，应当根据近期和远期工业的分布、建筑工程的需要和当地的具体条件，全面安排区域性的或供应个别城市的各种预制厂和加工厂、技术供应储备仓库和机械修配企业的建设数量、规模、时间和步骤，地方建筑材料的供应以及建筑工人的文化福利设施的建设。做好了建筑基地规划工作，就有可能避免基地建设中的盲目性和重复浪费等混乱现象。
    （六）有组织地进行勘察测量工作。区域规划，城市规划和厂内、厂外各项工程的设计，需要大量的基础资料，勘察测量工作对于规划、设计工作的速度和质量有决定性的影响。过去对同一地区各部门所进行的勘察测量工作缺乏统一的组织，以致一方面勘察测量的技术力量不足，另方面各部门又在做不少重复的工作。这不仅浪费了人力物力，而且也很难保证进度和质量。为了完成今后更加繁重的勘察测量工作任务，在同一地区内凡是能够统一进行的勘察测量工作，例如供选择厂址、城市规划和工厂初步设计所需的地形测量、工程地质和地下水源的勘察工作等，都应当由一个主要负责部门把有关单位统一组织起来，分工进行。就是不能统一组织的工作，各单位在工作中也应当互相配合，在技术规格上求得统一，以免各单位的勘察测量资料互相矛盾，影响设计质量。
    上述一系列的工作，都是加强新工业区和新工业城市建设准备工作的重要措施。为保证这些措施的实现，需要各主管建设的领导机关，大力组织新工业区和新工业城市的建设准备工作，逐步制定必要的规章、制度，经常检查工作，解决问题。需要中央和地方的工业部门、城市建设部门、交通运输部门以及其它一切有关部门，担负起在这些工作中应当担负的责任，并且在地方党委和人民委员会的统一领导下，主动配合，互相协助，共同把新工业区和新工业城市建设的准备工作做好。新工业区和新工业城市的建设准备工作，特别需要当地的党委和人民委员会加强领导，把中央各部门所属的和地方所属的有关单位在同一地区所进行的工作，统一加以安排，并且经常进行督促、检查，解决工作中发生的问题。对各建设单位之间、甲乙双方之间、工业部门和城市建设部门以及其它部门之间在配合协作中发生的问题，省（自治区）、市的党委和人民委员会有必要担负起排难解纷的责任，及时予以仲裁或向中央主管机关反映意见，以免拖延不决，延误建设进度。
    为了做好新工业区和新工业城市的建设准备工作，还必须建立和加强相应的勘察，设计机构。如负责区域规划和城市规划的设计机构，负责给水、排水、供电、供热和工业运输等工程设计的设计机构，负责工程地质、水文地质勘察和地形测量工作的勘察测量机构等，原来没有的，需要建立起来，原来有、但是和工作任务不相适应的、需要加以改进。
