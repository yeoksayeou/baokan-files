    Writing for Children
    By Polish writer, Weronika Troloppacka-Ogarkowa

    The Children's Literature Section of the Polish Writers' Union has been very active these days. Perhaps there isn't a school that doesn't invite well-known children's literature writers like Alin and Czesław Centkiewicz, Bobińska and Broniewska, Żukrowski and Porazińska to visit them. Broniewska's poems are familiar to them from textbooks, and Niedźwicki is approachable to them in his "Book of Imps," which has been a beloved work for all young adventurers for two years. The skies and seas described by Meissner attract them, and the young Eskimos in Centkiewicz's works have become the readers' close friends.

    Let me now say a few words about the achievements of our children's literature over the past decade. Our children's literature writers strive to broaden their horizons and delve into the minds of our young readers. Our starting point is that anything children care about should not be contrary to what adults care about. Whether it is revolution, social change, the struggle for peace, or conquering nature... these are all things that our young friends care about. And all of these have been reflected in most children's literature works in the past decade. Have we achieved our goals? Have we done well in this regard? At the congresses and meetings of the Youth Publishing House and the Polish Writers' Union, we discussed and analyzed our work. In this regard, the scale of the numbers is indeed unprecedented. In 1955 alone, 16,645,600 copies of children's literature works were published. We have also enabled Polish readers to become familiar with the best works of Soviet literature, and we have tried to broaden the scope of subjects, introducing children to their friends in people's democratic countries and their suffering brothers scattered around the world, and introducing them to the heroes of revolution and the struggle for social justice. "Spartacus's Student" by Galina Rudnicka is one of the students' favorite readings. The protagonist of Bobińska's "Young Pioneers" is our children's most beloved friend. The names of the heroes of the proletarian revolution are intimate and familiar to every child, and the novels depicting these heroic figures bring children closer to them, teaching them to love and respect them.

    In our discussions, we can point out many such positive factors. But have we made any mistakes? Yes. In the things we wanted to introduce to children, we forgot psychology and neglected the unique interests of children. We wanted to familiarize children with the adult world, but we were often not very clear or familiar with the children's world. It is precisely because of this that there are relatively few works that we call "adventurous." Children need heroic figures, but they also need to participate in activities with their own fantasies and emotions. In the past decade, too few of these books have been published. Apart from Broniewska's "Squad," there is no book describing the Young Pioneer organization; we did not portray children, children who fought in the bourgeois era, but we must know that at that time we established the heroic communist children's organization—the "Young Pioneers." We have not done enough in winning children's hearts and conducting ideological education for children. Now we are beginning to make up for this deficiency. We have a considerable group of children's literature writers. Some of our writers have only recently begun to write for children with their pens. Wojciech Żukrowski is one such example; he has already written his travelogues in Vietnam and China into beautiful books and stories for children. "Youth Banner" has begun to publish a novella written for young people by Jerzy Putrament. There are now nearly one hundred writers writing for children and adolescents. They are not all members of the Children's Literature Section of the Writers' Union, but the interest in creating for children is growing. This is a very good phenomenon. Lower-grade children read Julian Tuwim's works in their childhood, and his poems are one of the best achievements of our country's children's literature. Jan Brzechwa, a poet who writes for both children and adults, has set out to meet young readers. Janina Porazińska, who has written many works based on school themes, has also set out. Maria Kownacka has her own friends in every school. She has been observing the lives of birds for many years and often appears in schools with bird cages and beautiful stories about bird life. Hanna
  Januszewska is very popular, and her works are broadcast on the radio to the most remote corners of the country, and her poems and fairy tales can be found on the bookshelves of every school library.

    As for me personally, I have not been engaged in so-called "professional" literature for very long. After writing a few small works for children and young people, I wrote a four-volume novel "Kościuszko's Soldiers," and a novel "Forest Valley" with the theme of Belarusian children and Polish female teachers during the two world wars. It was this book that opened the hearts of readers for me. I wrote the novel "Kościuszko's Soldiers" for four years. The books were published successively, which made the readers impatient. They asked: Why aren't there second, third, and fourth volumes? Many impatient letters, questions, and requests talked about my book, thus establishing friendship and cooperation with many schools, rural areas, and district libraries. How did this friendship grow and consolidate? First of all, children found their peers in "Kościuszko's Soldiers," and the fate of these peers seemed to become their own. I heard some complaints from my little friends, who blamed me for why I wronged a hero, or did not avoid the death of another hero.

    Many young readers also attached gifts in their letters. For example, the children of Chodzież, Poznań Province, sent me a picture album with illustrations they personally drew for each story. Other children from Miedzyńa Głogowska (Łańcut District) sent a small statue of a Chinese hero that I had written about in the novel, along with a letter. This small statue was sculpted out of clay by a student's sister. Each of us writers receives many such small gifts from children.

    Each of us writers who writes for children receives many letters from young readers. The letters are varied: from solemnly asking writers to autograph their commemorative albums to confiding very intimate and heartfelt words. For example, Bobińska received a letter from her young friends in the nearby village of Sandomierz on her name day, along with some apples, which read: "...because there are not many apples in your Warsaw, and writers must have plenty of energy." After Comrade Beirut's death, a female student from Żyszów sent me a letter. She had attended the discussion with readers that I held in their city last October. At that time, I introduced my work "Forest Valley" at the meeting. She thought of her writer friend during our national mourning. She asked me to write more and in more detail about Comrade Beirut's funeral for the children. She was not satisfied with what she read in the newspapers and heard on the radio, but wanted to know more and in more detail. I was deeply touched by her letter, and I replied to her with a long letter.

    We cooperate with our readers. Books act as a bridge between us, making our cooperation frank and sincere. I reached an agreement with the children of Łańcut: I am preparing to write a book about a cruel landlord who lived there in the sixteenth century, and they are collecting materials for me. The people there know many stories passed down about this landlord, and the children very much hope that I will write such a book. I accepted their request and hope they will help. Now they have provided me with a lot of material. They collected some stories from their elderly parents and grandparents, excerpted some pieces of material from local past newspapers, and found the gate of the dungeon where this cruel landlord imprisoned serfs at that time.

    Our children are often influenced by religion and some reactionary priests, and schools and teachers are not strong enough in resisting this influence. Therefore, literature should help in this struggle against superstition. Some of our children's literature writers plan to visit schools, talk to parent committees, and go to Young Pioneer camps to see how children live during vacations in an unfettered and joyful environment. We are preparing to write a book about Young Pioneers and children who fight for their beliefs. Can we write a work that not only convinces children and their parents, but also makes them yearn for it? Can we write a work that not only helps those fighting children, but also helps those who are still being adversely affected? We should give a positive answer with our own efforts.

    为孩子们写作
    波兰作家　维隆尼卡·特洛帕契斯卡娅—奥加尔科娃
    波兰作家协会儿童文学部在这些日子里显得非常活跃。也许没有一个学校不邀请像阿林和契斯拉夫·岑特凯维支、包宾斯卡娅和布洛涅夫斯卡娅、茹克洛夫斯基和波拉仁斯卡娅这些知名的儿童文学作家到他们那里去。布洛涅夫斯卡娅的诗是他们从课本中熟悉的，尼久尔斯基是他们在他的“顽童的书”中接近起来的，“顽童的书”两年以来成了所有年轻的奇闻探求者的心爱的作品。马伊斯涅尔所描写的天空和海洋吸引了他们，而岑特凯维支作品中的年轻的爱斯基摩人也变成了读者的知心朋友。
    现在就我们儿童文学十年来的成就谈几句。我们的儿童文学作家，力求扩大自己的眼界，深入我们的年轻读者的心灵。我们的出发点是：儿童们所关心的任何事物都不应当是与成年人们背道而驰的。无论是革命、社会变化、争取和平的斗争和征服自然……这些事都是我们的青少年朋友所关切的。而所有这些，也都在过去十年内的大多数儿童文学著作里面得到了反映。我们是否达到了自己的目的，我们在这方面做好了没有？在青年读物出版社和波兰作家协会的大会和会议上，我们对自己的工作进行了讨论和分析。在这方面，就数字之大来说，的确是很空前的。仅在1955年一年，就出版了一千六百六十四万五千六百册儿童文学作品。我们还使波兰读者能够熟悉苏联文学的最优秀的作品，我们尽力扩大题材范围，向儿童们介绍他们在人民民主国家的朋友以及那些散处世界各地的受折磨的他们的兄弟们，向他们介绍革命和为争取社会正义而斗争的英雄。加丽娜·鲁德尼兹卡娅所著“斯巴达克的学生”是学生们最喜爱的读物之一。包宾斯卡娅的“少先队”的主人公是我们儿童们最心爱的朋友。无产阶级革命英雄的名字对每个儿童都是亲切和熟悉的，描写这些英雄人物的小说使孩子们接近他们，使孩子们学会热爱和尊敬他们。
    在我们的讨论中可以指出很多这样的肯定因素。但我们有没有错误呢？有的。在我们想向儿童们介绍的事物中，我们忘记了心理学，忽略了儿童们所特有的兴趣。我们想让孩子们熟悉成年人的世界，但是我们对儿童们的世界常常是不很清楚、不很熟悉的。也正因为这样，那些被我们称作“冒险的”作品是比较少的。儿童们需要英雄的形象，但他们也要以自己的幻想和感情参加活动。十年来，这种书出得太少了。除了布洛涅夫斯卡娅的“小队”以外，竟没有描写少先队组织的书；我们没有去表现儿童，表现在资产阶级时代作斗争的儿童，可是要知道，那时我们曾经建立了英勇的共产主义儿童组织——“少先队”的。我们在争取儿童的心灵和对儿童进行思想教育方面做得不够。现在我们开始来弥补这个缺陷。我们有不小的一批儿童文学作家。我们的作家中间有些人是不久以前才开始用自己的笔为儿童写作的。沃伊捷赫·茹克洛夫斯基就是这样，他已经把自己在越南和中国的游记写成了美丽的书和故事给孩子们看。“青年旗帜报”开始刊登埃日·普特拉曼特为青年们写的中篇小说。现在为儿童和青少年写作的作家将近一百人。他们并不全都是作家协会儿童文学部的成员，但是人们为儿童们创作的兴趣却在增长。这是很好的现象。低年级的儿童们在幼年时期就读尤利扬·土维姆的作品，他的诗是我国儿童文学的最优秀的成果之一。杨·布热霍瓦是一个既为儿童写作也为成年人写作的诗人，他已出发去会见年轻的读者。写了许多取材于学校的作品的雅尼娜·波拉仁斯卡娅也出发了。玛利亚·科夫纳茨卡娅在每一个学校都有自己的朋友，她已经对鸟类的生活观察了许多年，常常带着鸟笼和鸟类生活的美丽故事在学校中出现。甘娜
  ·雅奴舍夫斯卡娅是很受欢迎的，她的作品用无线电播送到全国最遥远的角落里，而她的诗和童话可以在每个学校图书馆的书架上找到。
    至于说到我个人，我开始从事所谓“专业”的文学还不怎么久。在为儿童和青年写了几本不大的作品以后，我写了四卷集的小说“科斯丘什克的士兵”，和以两次大战期间白俄罗斯儿童和波兰女教师为主题的小说“林间山谷”。正是这本书为我打开了读者的心灵。我写小说“科斯丘什克的士兵”写了四年。书是陆续出版的，这使读者等不及了。他们问：为什么没有第二卷，第三卷，第四卷呢？在许多急不可耐的来信、问题和请求中都谈到了我的书，因而使我同许多学校、农村和区的图书馆建立起友谊和合作。这种友谊是怎样增长和巩固的呢？首先是孩子们在“科斯丘什克的士兵”里找到了自己的同年人，这些同年人的命运好像成了他们自己的命运。我听到了若干来自我的小朋友们的抱怨，他们责备我为什么让一个英雄受了委屈，或者是没有避免另一个英雄的死亡。
    许多小读者在他们的信里还附来了礼物。例如，波兹南州霍杰日的孩子们寄给我一本由他们亲自对每篇故事画了插图的画册。米德季那·格洛戈夫斯卡（兰楚特区）的另一些孩子们同信一起寄来了一个我在小说中曾经写到过的中国英雄的小塑像。这个小塑像是一个学生的姐姐用粘土塑造的。我们每一个作家都收到孩子们的许多这样的小礼物。
    我们每一个给儿童写作的作家都收到很多小读者的来信。信是各种各样的：从郑重其事地要求作家在他们的纪念册上亲笔签名直到倾吐自己非常亲切的知心话。例如，包宾斯卡娅在她的命名日的时候，收到临近的山多米什村她的少年朋友的一封信，随信还附来了一些苹果，信里写道：“……因为你们华沙的苹果不多，而作家必须有充沛的精力。”在贝鲁特同志逝世以后，日索夫的一个女学生寄给我一封信。她曾经参加过去年十月我在他们的城里同读者们举行的讨论会。当时我曾在会上介绍了自己的作品“林间山谷”。在我们全民哀悼的时候她想起了作家朋友。她请求我为孩子们更多和更详细地写关于贝鲁特同志葬仪的事情。她对于在报纸上读到的和在无线电中听到的那些还不满足，而想知道得更多些和更详细些。我深为她的来信感动，我给她复了一封长信。
    我们同我们的读者合作。书籍在我们之间起着桥梁的作用，使我们的合作是坦率的和诚恳的。我同兰楚特的儿童们达成了这样一个协议：我准备写一本关于十六世纪曾经居住在那里的一个残酷的地主的书，他们为我收集材料。那里的人知道很多流传下来的关于这个地主的事情，儿童们很希望我写这样一本书。我接受了他们的要求，并希望他们给予帮助。现在他们已经供给了我大量的材料。他们从年老的父母和祖父那里收集了一些故事，从当地过去报纸上摘录下一些片断的材料，并且找出了这个残酷的地主当时囚禁农奴的深窖的大门。
    我们的儿童常常受到宗教的影响和一些反动的神甫的影响，而学校和教师们在抵抗这种影响时显得还不够有力。因此，文学应该来帮助进行这种反对迷信的斗争。我们的一些儿童文学作家打算参观学校，和家长委员会谈一谈，再到少先营去看一看，在休假中、在无牵无挂的愉快环境中孩子们是如何生活的。我们准备写一本关于为自己的信念而斗争的少先队员和儿童的书。我们能不能写出这样一部不仅使儿童和他们的父母信服的，而且使他们心神向往的作品呢？能不能写出一部不仅能帮助那些战斗的儿童，而且也能帮助那些还在受到不良影响的儿童的作品呢？我们应该以自己的努力来给以肯定的答案。
