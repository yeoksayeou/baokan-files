Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: The cotton sowing tasks in the cotton-producing provinces and regions across the country have been mostly completed. Currently, the seedlings in the early-sown cotton fields in Henan, Shandong, Hubei, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces have all emerged from the soil and are growing vigorously.

In order to ensure a bumper cotton harvest this year, various regions are actively taking measures to strengthen the management of cotton seedlings. After the completion of cotton sowing, Hubei Province combined inspections with timely activities such as protecting seedlings, ensuring full stands, and thinning seedlings. Replanting and covering with soil were carried out promptly for broken ridges, missing seedlings, and areas where the soil cover was not tight. Some areas have also universally launched "hill-by-hill inspection, plot-by-plot appraisal" and "one inspection, four guarantees" (inspect quality, guarantee emergence, full stands, strong seedlings, and even seedlings) campaigns. Many agricultural production cooperatives have also designated responsibility areas for seedling inspection and replanting based on the cotton seedling emergence situation, achieving dedicated replanting and immediate replanting after inspection. Cotton-producing areas such as Hebei, Shaanxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi are also currently carrying out various tasks to ensure full and vigorous seedlings.

　　全国早播棉田幼苗生长茁壮
    据新华社8日讯  全国各产棉省、区的棉花播种任务已经大部结束。现在，河南、山东、湖北、陕西、江苏、浙江等省的早播棉田的幼苗，已经全部出土，并且生长得都很茁壮旺盛。
    为了保证今年棉花丰收，各地正在积极采取措施，加强对棉田幼苗的管理工作。湖北省在棉花播种结束后，就结合检查，及时开展保苗、全苗、间苗等活动。对断垅、缺苗、盖土不严的都及时的进行了补种和掩土。有些地区还普遍开展了“丘丘检查、块块鉴定”和“一查四保”（查质量、保出苗、全苗、壮苗、匀苗）运动。许多农业生产合作社还根据棉苗出土情况，分片固定了查苗、补苗责任区，作到了专人补种、随查随补。河北、陕西、安徽、江苏、浙江、江西等产棉地区现在也都正在进行保证苗全苗旺的各种工作。
