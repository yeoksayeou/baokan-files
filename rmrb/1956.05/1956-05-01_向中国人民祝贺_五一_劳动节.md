    Congratulating the Chinese People on "May Day" Labor Day
    Akira Iwai, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan
    On the occasion of "May Day" Labor Day, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Chinese people on behalf of the Japanese workers.
    We, the Japanese workers, eagerly desire peace and are fighting for it together with the people of many Asian countries. Because we know that only peace is the greatest guarantee of our lives. We, the Japanese workers, were once instilled with the idea that "Japan is the leader of Asia" and were wrongly led onto the path of aggression against various Asian countries. However, Japan's defeat made us personally experience how full of deception that kind of propaganda was. Today, what we are considering is how to get along with people all over the world in a friendly way. We realize that to do this effectively, we first need the solidarity and friendly coexistence of all of Asia. We know that our task today is to join hands with the working class all over the world to stop war. To this end, first of all, the workers led by our "General Council" must strengthen friendly relations with all Asian workers. The backwardness and colonial nature that are common in Asia give us a deep common emotion, and we believe that this emotion will promote friendly relations between us. We are also working hard to hold a meeting to enhance contact within this year.
    We deeply admire you for overthrowing the ancient feudalism and warlord rule, and for being truly reborn as a socialist country. The achievements you have won through struggle have set an example for us. We, the Japanese working people, must also establish a labor people's regime in Japan.
    Finally, I would like to express my deep gratitude to you for giving us, the Japanese trade union leaders, the opportunity to go to China, so that we can see the situation of your construction of a new country and talk with many people.
    Japan-China friendship is the foundation of world peace.

    向中国人民祝贺“五一”劳动节
    日本工会总评议会事务局长　岩井章
    当“五一”劳动节的时候，我谨代表日本工人，向中国人民致以衷心的祝贺。
    我们日本工人热望和平，并且正同亚洲许多国家的人民在一起，为争取和平而进行斗争。因为我们知道，只有和平才是我们生活的最大保障。我们日本工人曾经被灌输“日本是亚洲盟主”的思想，被错误地引到侵略亚洲各国的道路上去。可是，日本的战败使我们切身体验到那种宣传是如何充满了欺骗。今天我们考虑的是，怎样同全世界的人们友好相处。我们认识到要切实地作到这点，首先需要全亚洲的团结和友好相处。我们知道，今天我们的任务是同全世界的工人阶级携起手来，制止战争。为此，首先我们“总评”所领导的工人必须加强同全亚洲工人的友好。亚洲所普遍存在的落后性和殖民地性，使我们之间有着一种深厚的共同情感，我们相信这种情感一定会促进我们之间的友好关系。我们也正在努力，准备在今年内召开增进联系的会议。
    我们深深地敬佩你们，你们推翻了古老的封建主义和军阀统治，真正作为社会主义国家而新生了。你们经过奋斗所争得的成就，给我们树立了榜样，我们日本劳动人民一定也要在日本建立劳动人民的政权。
    最后，谨向你们表示深切的谢意，感谢你们给了我们日本工会领导人到中国去的机会，使我们能够参观你们建设新国家的情况并同许多人进行交谈。
    日中友好是世界和平的基础。
