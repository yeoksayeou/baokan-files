Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 9th -- The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is actively preparing for the production of automobiles.

　　Since May, most of the basic production workshops have transitioned from parts adjustment to trial assembly line production and batch assembly of complete units. In these workshops, newly installed production equipment is operating busily.

　　Workers in various auxiliary production workshops have recently been working in two shifts daily to manufacture various tools. They need to produce the complete set of tools required for producing the first batch of automobiles before the cars are produced. Workers in the power supply departments are striving to put all five power stations into production in the near future.

　　Thousands of workers have already mastered modern automobile manufacturing technology. Now, during the trial assembly line production, they are further learning the technology of formally organizing automobile production from the Soviet experts who are helping to build the factory.

　　Material preparation is currently the most urgent task. In the factory's warehouse area, transportation workers have formed a joint transportation team, transporting large quantities of materials from the railway trunk line to various warehouses and delivering them to the workshops every day. Now, many large warehouses, like various equipment companies, are gradually filling up with various materials, tools, and collaborative products.

　　汽车厂职工积极为出产汽车作准备
    据新华社长春9日电  第一汽车制造厂正为出产汽车作准备。
    从五月以来，大部分基本生产车间已经由零件调整过渡到流水试生产和成批地装配总成。在这些车间内，新安装好的生产设备，正在繁忙地运转着。
    各辅助生产车间的职工，最近每天分成两班制造着各种工具。他们要在出汽车以前把生产第一批汽车所需要的全套工具生产出来。动力供应部门的职工，正在争取使五种动力站在最近期间全部投入生产。
    成千上万的职工已经掌握现代化的汽车制造技术。现在他们正在流水试生产中，进一步向帮助建厂的苏联专家学习正式组织汽车生产的技术。
    物资准备工作是当前最紧张的一项工作。在这个工厂的仓库区，运输职工组成了联运组，每天由铁路干线把大批的物资运到各种仓库，并且送到车间。现在好多大仓库，就像各种器材公司一样，逐渐装满了各种材料、工具和协作产品。
