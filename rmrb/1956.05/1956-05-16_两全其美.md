Recently, basic construction units and industrial enterprises in Qiqihar City signed contracts with agricultural production cooperatives in the suburban districts of the city regarding the handling of temporary labor. This provided basic construction units and industrial enterprises with more than 6,000 temporary workers and also found a way out for the surplus labor in the countryside.

In the high tide of the socialist revolution, scattered laborers in the cities have been organized, and the unemployed population has gradually returned to the countryside to participate in production. In the countryside, individual farmers have mostly become members of cooperatives. Therefore, there is a shortage of sources for the temporary labor needed by industrial enterprises and basic construction departments. According to a survey by the Heilongjiang Provincial Labor Bureau, industrial enterprises and basic construction departments throughout the province still need more than 60,000 temporary laborers this year. Where can we find so many people? Currently, the main reliance is on certain surplus labor from agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs. A survey by the Ya Pu Sai Cooperative in the suburbs of Qiqihar City proves that, based on the existing labor force and cultivated land area, 10% of the labor force can be drawn during the busy summer hoeing season, and an average of 15% of the labor force can be drawn throughout the year to support industrial construction. The suburbs of this city have 6,200 laborers who can support industrial construction year-round.

The important significance of industrial construction and production units signing contracts with cooperatives regarding the handling of temporary labor also lies in the fact that this is the organized mobilization of farmers, based on an increased socialist consciousness, to support the country's industrial construction in a planned manner. This benefits the country on the one hand and increases the actual income of the cooperatives on the other. This is also a matter of great significance for consolidating the worker-peasant alliance.

    两全其美

    最近，齐齐哈尔市的基本建设和工业企业单位，同市郊区农业生产合作社签订了关于处理临时劳动力的合同，给基本建设和工业企业单位找到了六千多名临时工人，又给农村的剩余劳动力找到了出路。
    在社会主义革命高潮的形势下，城市里的分散的劳动者已组织起来，没有职业的人口已逐渐回农村参加生产；在农村中，单干农户多已成为合作社社员。因此，工业企业和基本建设部门所需要的临时劳动力，就缺少来源了。据黑龙江省劳动局调查，全省今年工业企业、基本建设部门还需要六万多个临时劳动力，上那儿去找这么些人呢？在目前，主要依靠郊区农业生产合作社的某些剩余劳动力。齐齐哈尔市郊区雅蒲赛社调查证明：根据现有劳动力和耕种地面积，在夏锄农忙的季节，可抽出10％的劳动力，一年平均起来则可抽出15％的劳动力去支援工业建设。这个市郊区全年就有六千二百个劳动力，能够常年支援工业建设。
    工业建设、生产单位跟合作社签订关于处理临时劳动力的合同，它的重要意义还在于：这是有组织的农民，在提高了社会主义觉悟的基础上，有计划地组织他们去支援国家的工业建设，一来对国家有好处，二来也增加了合作社的实际收入。这对巩固工农联盟也是有重要意义的事。
