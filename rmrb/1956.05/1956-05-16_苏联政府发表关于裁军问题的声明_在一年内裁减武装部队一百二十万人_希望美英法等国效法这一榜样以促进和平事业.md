Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 15th: The Soviet government issued a statement on disarmament on May 14th, saying that the Soviet government has decided to reduce its armed forces by 1.2 million people within one year, until May 1, 1957, disband sixty-three divisions and independent brigades, and decommission three hundred and seventy-five warships.

    The Soviet government's statement first pointed out that international tensions have eased recently. Contacts between countries have greatly expanded, and meetings and contacts between leaders of major countries have also resumed. In these talks, major international issues have begun to be discussed, including some issues on which there are differences; everyone is striving to find ways to reconcile the views and attitudes of countries with different social systems. In various countries, the position of those who support international cooperation is constantly strengthening. A vast area of peace has been formed. All this promotes the easing of international tensions and the consolidation of peace.

    However, one should not be satisfied with the achievements already made. International tensions have not been completely eliminated, the necessary international trust has not been established, and the aggressive forces of some countries are still attempting to implement their old policies that harm the interests of peace.

    The continued arms race is the main obstacle to further easing international tensions. Countries still maintain huge armed forces. Stockpiles of atomic and hydrogen bombs are still being built up, and millions upon millions of young people are shouldering guns, detached from peaceful and constructive labor.

    The statement went on to point out that the continued arms race only benefits large monopoly capital, brings heavy burdens to the working people, and aggravates the crisis of war. The statement pointed out that under modern armament conditions, if a third world war were to occur, it would cause humanity far more terrible losses than before. This situation requires the people of all countries and the governments of all countries who are responsible for the fate of their countries to take effective measures to stop the arms race and prevent the possibility of the outbreak of a third world war. The international situation can and should be further improved first and foremost through the reduction of armaments and through the implementation of effective disarmament measures.

    The statement then discussed in detail the various efforts made by the Soviet Union for disarmament and the various proposals put forward since the Second World War, as well as the process by which Western governments used various pretexts to obstruct the resolution of the disarmament issue. The statement said that the Soviet government believes that the time has come for the United Nations Disarmament Commission to broadly and publicly review the work results of the subcommittee composed of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, France, and Canada, so that everyone can understand who is promoting and who is hindering the cessation of the arms race; and to plan concrete ways to realize the United Nations General Assembly resolution on disarmament, which was adopted as early as ten years ago.

    The Soviet government will continue to resolutely strive for an internationally acceptable agreement on reducing the armed forces of all countries and banning atomic and hydrogen (thermonuclear) weapons. At the same time, the Soviet government believes that under the conditions that have now been formed, what is needed first is practical action that can promote the task of greatly reducing the armaments of all countries and stopping the arms race.

    If countries can take practical actions to shift the issue of disarmament from general, fruitless discussions to specific disarmament matters, then such practical actions by these countries under the current conditions will be the best way to further ease international tensions and strengthen mutual trust between countries.

    The Soviet government hopes to contribute to the cause of disarmament and safeguarding peace, and hopes to create more favorable conditions for the Soviet Union's peaceful construction in the economic and cultural fields. Therefore, it has made the following decisions:

    1. To make further and greater reductions in the number of Soviet armed forces within one year until May 1, 1957, that is, to reduce another 1.2 million people in addition to the 640,000 people reduced in the Soviet armed forces in 1955.

    2. Therefore, sixty-three divisions and independent brigades will be disbanded, including three air force divisions and other combat troops, totaling more than 30,000 people, currently stationed in the German Democratic Republic. Some military schools of the Soviet army will be disbanded. Three hundred and seventy-five naval warships will also be decommissioned.

    3. In accordance with the above circumstances, the armaments and combat equipment of the Soviet armed forces will be reduced, and military expenditures in the Soviet national budget will be reduced.

    4. To provide demobilized active servicemen with employment opportunities in industry and agriculture.

    The Soviet government's adoption of this new step to greatly reduce the number of Soviet armed forces and armaments is hoped to promote the practical realization of the disarmament plan being discussed by the United Nations.

    The Soviet government has taken this decision because it takes into account the fact that, as far as Europe is concerned, the people of France, the people of Britain, and the people of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving European countries do not want war. They are still suffering from the hardships of war, and they hope to improve relations between countries and comprehensively develop international cooperation.

    The governments of other countries, including the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, since they sincerely hope to promote the consolidation of the cause of peace, cannot but follow this example.

    If Western countries such as the United States, Britain, and France correspondingly reduce their armed forces and armaments, the Soviet government is prepared to study the issue of further reducing the Soviet armed forces.

    The implementation of such measures is an important stage on the road to achieving a comprehensive disarmament plan, and will create realistic prerequisites for accelerating the resolution of the issue of banning atomic and hydrogen weapons.

    The statement emphasized that the starting point for the Soviet government's adoption of the above decision is that allowing 1.2 million Soviet citizens to return to peaceful labor that is beneficial to society is another great contribution to the further improvement of various sectors of the Soviet national economy, and will greatly increase the material and cultural wealth of our socialist society. At the same time, further reducing military expenditures in the Soviet national budget can allocate the funds freed up to peaceful construction, so as to more smoothly realize our country's magnificent plan for socialist development and improving the welfare of the Soviet people.

    The statement concluded by saying that the basis for the Soviet government's renewed large-scale reduction of Soviet armed forces and armaments is that the forces of peace have now been greatly strengthened, they are more perfectly organized, and there are many ways to give any attempt to undermine peace the punishment it deserves. At the same time, the Soviet government expresses its belief that the Soviet armed forces can reliably defend the peaceful labor of our people, and believes that the Soviet people and the peace-loving people of other countries will not relax their vigilance and will be more vigilant against the conspiracies of forces that are hostile to peace and international peaceful cooperation.

### 苏联政府发表关于裁军问题的声明  在一年内裁减武装部队一百二十万人  希望美英法等国效法这一榜样以促进和平事业

    苏联政府发表关于裁军问题的声明
    在一年内裁减武装部队一百二十万人
    希望美英法等国效法这一榜样以促进和平事业
    新华社莫斯科15日电　苏联政府在五月十四日发表了一项关于裁军问题的声明说，苏联政府决定在到1957年5月1日为止的一年内裁减武装部队一百二十万人，解散六十三个师和独立旅，并且把三百七十五艘军舰停止使用。
    苏联政府的声明首先指出，最近时期国际紧张局势有了缓和。各国之间的联系大大地扩大了，大国领导人之间的会谈和接触也恢复了。在这些会谈中，已经开始讨论重大的国际问题，其中包括存在有分歧的一些问题；大家在努力寻求使社会制度不同的国家的见解和态度取得一致的办法。在各个国家中，拥护国际合作的人的地位在不断加强。一个广大的和平地区已经形成。这一切都促进国际紧张局势的缓和和和平的巩固。
    但是，不应该满足于已有的成就。国际紧张局势还没有完全消除，国际上的必要的信任还没有确立，而有些国家的侵略势力还企图执行他们的那种危害和平利益的老方针。
    继续不断的扩充军备是进一步缓和国际紧张局势的主要障碍。各国还是保持着庞大的武装部队。原子弹和氢弹的储备还在进行中，千千万万的年轻人背上了枪杆，脱离了和平的建设性劳动。
    声明接着指出继续扩充军备只对大垄断资本有利，给劳动人民带来了沉重的负担，而且加重了战争危机。声明指出在现代军备条件下，第三次世界大战如果发生，就会使人类遭到比以前更为惨重得多的损失。这种局势要求各国人民和对本国命运负有责任的各国政府，采取有效措施来停止扩充军备和防止第三次世界大战爆发的可能性。国际局势是首先可以、而且应当通过缩减军备、通过实行有效的裁军措施而得到进一步改善的。
    声明接着详细谈到苏联在第二次世界大战以后为裁军问题所作的各种努力和提出的各项建议，以及西方国家政府利用各种借口阻挠裁军问题获得解决的经过。声明说，苏联政府认为，现在这样一个时候已经到来：即联合国裁军委员会应当广泛公开审查由苏、美、英、法、加拿大组成的小组委员会的工作结果，让大家都了解，谁在促进和谁在阻挠停止扩充军备；并且规划出具体实现早在十年前就通过了的联合国大会关于裁军的决议的途径。
    苏联政府今后仍将坚决争取在裁减各国武装力量和禁止原子武器和氢（热核子）武器方面达成大家可以接受的国际协议。同时，苏联政府认为，在现在已经形成的条件下，首先需要的就是可以促成解决大大裁减各国军备和停止扩充军备的任务的实际行动。
    如果各国能采取实际行动，把裁减军备问题从泛泛的、无益的谈论方面转移到裁减军备具体事务方面，那末这些国家这样一些实际行动在目前条件下就会是进一步缓和国际紧张局势、加强国与国之间相互信任的最好方法。
    苏联政府希望在裁军和保障和平的事业中作出贡献，希望为苏联在经济和文化上的和平建设创造更为有利的条件，所以它作出了下列决定：
    一、在到1957年5月1日为止的一年内作再次更多地裁减苏联武装部队人数，即除1955年裁减苏联武装部队六十四万人之外，再裁减一百二十万人。
    二、因此要解散六十三个师和独立旅，包括解散现在驻在德意志民主共和国境内的、共有三万多人的三个空军师和其他战斗部队。一部分苏联军队的军事学校将要解散。三百七十五艘海军军舰也将停止使用。
    三、根据上述情况，裁减苏联武装力量的军备和战斗装备，并且减少苏联国家预算中的军费支出。
    四、给遣散的现役军人以在工农业中就业的机会。
    苏联政府采取这个新的步骤来大大地裁减苏联武装部队和军备的数量，是希望促进联合国正在讨论中的裁军计划的实际实现。
    苏联政府采取这样的决定是因为它估计到这样的事实：就欧洲而言，法国人民、英国人民，以及苏联和其他爱好和平的欧洲国家的人民都不希望战争，他们现在还饱尝着战争的艰辛的后果，他们希望改善各国间的关系，希望全面发展国际合作。
    其他国家的政府，其中包括美国、英国和法国的政府，既然真诚地希望促进和平事业的巩固，就不能不效法这一榜样。
    如果美国、英国、法国这些西方国家相应地裁减它们的武装力量和军备，苏联政府准备研究关于进一步裁减苏联武装部队的问题。
    实现这样的措施是实现通盘裁军计划的道路上的一个重要阶段，并且将为加速解决禁止原子武器和氢武器的问题创造现实的前提。
    声明强调说，苏联政府采取上述决定的出发点是：使一百二十万苏联公民复员到对社会有益的和平劳动中去，对于进一步提高苏联国民经济各部门是又一个巨大的贡献，并且将为我们社会主义社会大大增加物质和文化财富。同时，进一步缩减苏联国家预算中的军费开支就可以把腾出的资金用于和平建设，以便更加顺利地实现我国社会主义发展和提高苏联人民的福利的宏伟计划。
    声明最后说，苏联政府再次大规模裁减苏联武装部队和军备的根据是：现在，和平力量是大大地加强了，他们是更加完善地组织起来了，并且有许多办法给予任何企图破坏和平的尝试以应有的打击。同时，苏联政府表示相信，苏联武装部队能够可靠地捍卫我国人民的和平劳动，相信苏联人民和其他国家爱好和平的人民不会放松他们的警惕，并且将更加警惕地戒备仇视和平和国际和平合作事业的势力的阴谋。
