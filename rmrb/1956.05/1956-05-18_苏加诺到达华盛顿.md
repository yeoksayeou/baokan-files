Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 17th: Indonesian President Sukarno arrived in Washington from Honolulu on the 16th, beginning his visit to the United States. U.S. Vice President Nixon and Secretary of State Dulles, among others, welcomed him at the airport. A grand welcoming ceremony was held at the airport. Nixon and Sukarno delivered speeches successively. In his speech, Nixon compared Sukarno to America's George Washington.

Sukarno was welcomed by Eisenhower in front of the White House. Subsequently, Eisenhower hosted a banquet for Sukarno at the White House. He also presented Sukarno with a silver bowl symbolizing the struggle for independence.

Agence France-Presse said that the U.S. government's welcome to Sukarno this time was "unprecedented," and all the way from the airport to the White House, there were dazzling military bands in uniform and guard of honors from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps.

U.S. "Newsweek" columnist Lindley said in an article welcoming President Sukarno: Indonesia has chosen a policy of "non-alignment," and the U.S. attempt to force Indonesia to join military blocs is a "mistake."

    苏加诺到达华盛顿
    新华社17日讯　华盛顿消息：印度尼西亚总统苏加诺在十六日从檀香山飞抵华盛顿，开始对美国的访问。美国副总统尼克松和国务卿杜勒斯等人在飞机场上欢迎他。飞机场上举行了一个隆重的欢迎仪式。尼克松和苏加诺先后致词。尼克松在致词中把苏加诺比做美国的乔治·华盛顿。
    苏加诺在白宫门前受到艾森豪威尔的欢迎。接着，艾森豪威尔在白宫设宴款待苏加诺。他还把一只象征独立斗争的银碗送给苏加诺。
    法新社说，美国政府这次对苏加诺的欢迎是“空前未有”的，在从飞机场到白宫的一路上，都排列着穿着制服的耀眼的军乐队和陆、海、空军以及海军陆战队的仪仗队。
    美国“新闻周刊”专栏作家林德莱在一篇欢迎苏加诺总统的文章中说：印度尼西亚选择的是“不参加集团”的政策，美国企图迫使印度尼西亚参加军事集团的作法，是“犯了错误”。
