A Factory That "Humbly Accepts" Criticism But Resolutely Does Not Correct Mistakes

Editor Comrade:

　　In Qingdao, any unit that has dealt with the local state-owned Qingdao Shiye (Industry) Printing Factory knows that this factory is not trustworthy and that the printed materials they undertake have an especially large number of errors. In 1953, of a batch of trade union membership cards they printed, more than 80% of the first delivery of over 10,000 pieces were substandard. In the 1956 calendars printed for the Qingdao Cultural Goods Company in 1955, many had the months and dates reversed. For many years, the Shiye Cigarette Factory has relied on this printing factory to print cigarette boxes, and has suffered serious losses because the cigarette boxes are often delivered late and are of poor quality. The direct loss in the past year alone was 6,000 yuan, and the total loss, including downtime and labor, is estimated to be over 14,000 yuan.

　　Since 1953, the Qingdao Daily has frequently received letters from readers criticizing the Shiye Printing Factory, and these letters have been published in the newspaper more than once. The Shiye Printing Factory has always responded promptly to each criticism published or forwarded by the newspaper. They always admit that the readers' criticisms are correct, express their intention to improve their work, and guarantee that "similar accidents will not happen again." Unfortunately, this "serious" attitude is only reflected on paper, and "similar accidents" continue to happen again and again! Sometimes, before the Qingdao Daily's reader letters group has had time to forward the factory's "self-criticism" to the reader, another reader's letter of criticism arrives.

　　Why doesn't the Shiye Printing Factory correct its mistakes after each self-criticism? Is it because they have insurmountable difficulties in production? That is not the case. For example, one of the reasons affecting the quality of printed products is that paper expands and contracts greatly due to climatic conditions, but the factory has already found a solution, but it has simply not resolutely implemented it.

　　We hope that the Shiye Printing Factory will correct its attitude towards criticism, turn its promises on paper into practical actions, and earnestly improve its work.

### 一个“虚心接受”批评而坚决不改正错误的工厂

　　一个“虚心接受”批评而坚决不改正错误的工厂
　　编辑同志：
    在青岛，只要是和地方国营青岛实业印刷厂打过交道的单位，都知道这个厂不守信用，而且承印的物件差错特别多。1953年他们承印的一批工会会员证，第一次交货的一万多件中，就有80％以上不合规格。1955年代青岛市文化用品公司印制的1956年日历中，月份、日期颠倒的很多。历年来依靠这个厂印制烟盒的实业烟厂，因为烟盒经常误期交货、而且质量低劣，遭受到严重损失。单去年一年的直接损失就有六千元，加上停机、人工的损失估计总数在一万四千元以上。
    1953年以来，青岛日报经常接到很多读者批评实业印刷厂的来信，这些信件曾经不止一次地在报纸上发表过。对报纸发表的或转去的每次批评，实业印刷厂都及时地给了答复。他们总是承认读者的批评是正确的，表示要改进工作，并且保证使“类似事故不再发生。”遗憾的是，这种“认真”态度只表现在纸上，“类似事故”仍然一再发生！有时甚至青岛日报读者来信组还没有来得及把这个厂的“检讨”转给读者，另一个读者的批评信又来了。
    为什么实业印刷厂每次检讨了错误以后，却不改正呢？是不是他们在生产中有着难于克服的困难？事实不是这样。例如，这个厂影响印刷成品质量的原因之一是纸张因气候关系伸缩性较大，但是厂里已经找到了解决办法，只是没有坚决实行吧了。
    我们希望实业印刷厂端正对批评的态度，把纸上的保证变成实际行动，切实来改进自己的工作。  夏懋勤  袁保鋆
