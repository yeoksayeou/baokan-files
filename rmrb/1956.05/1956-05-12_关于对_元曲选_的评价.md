On the Evaluation of "Selected Yuan Operas"
    Dai Bufan
    "Selected Yuan Operas" is a collection of zaju (the most popular form of opera in the 13th-14th centuries) scripts compiled and published by Zang Jinshu in 1616. It includes 100 works. These scripts are complete with both dialogue and lyrics, and the content is complete. The texts have been collated and organized, and they are annotated with phonetic transcriptions, making them relatively easy to read. Of the Yuan Dynasty zaju scripts, which occupy an important position in the history of Chinese literature, only over 130 have been handed down, and "Selected Yuan Operas" contains more than 90 of them. From the point of view of preserving dramatic literature alone, Zang Jinshu's work of collecting and selecting is very valuable.
    Scholars who are superstitious about ancient editions have always looked down on "Selected Yuan Operas." Wu Mei, for example, used the Yuan edition of "Ancient and Modern Zaju" to prove that Zang Jinshu had "made a complete mess" of the scripts (see "ABC of Yuan Opera Research"). This statement is unfounded. This is because the basic content of the scripts collected in both "Ancient and Modern Zaju" and "Selected Yuan Operas" is not different. Slight differences in the lyrics are not necessarily the result of Zang Jinshu's "arbitrary deletions and random changes." (It is very common for troupes and actors to make slight changes to the lyrics and content to suit their own conditions, or to enrich the original work during performances.) Moreover, we have no way of proving that "Ancient and Modern Zaju" is necessarily the author's original version. Comparing the lyrics of the third act of "Autumn in the Han Palace," which comes from the "Sea of Lyrics and Tunes" - Li Kaixian's family, it is not difficult to find that the literary quality of "Selected Yuan Operas" is relatively high. "Ancient and Modern Zaju" only has more detailed dialogue for the main characters, which is a script equivalent to the "single sheet" of Peking Opera, making it very difficult to read, like Guan Hanqing's "Teasing the Wind and Moon". "Selected Yuan Operas," which comes from the "Royal Opera Supervision" edition, is like the "complete script" of Peking Opera. It is a complete stage performance script and is much more convenient to watch than the "single sheet." Of course, "Ancient and Modern Zaju" is also a valuable document, but to belittle "Selected Yuan Operas" with a version that is incomplete and has fragmented dialogue, holding on to the idea that the older the version, the better, is no different from telling people not to live in tall buildings but to live in dilapidated ancient temples.
    It is even more inappropriate for scholars like Mr. Yan Dunyi to deny the value of this book because the source of "Selected Yuan Operas" is the "Royal Opera Supervision" edition (the Imperial Library edition) (see "Literary Heritage" issue 78: Yan Dunyi's "On Yuan Zaju"). If we take a slightly more serious look at the content of "Selected Yuan Operas," then we would not, like Mr. Yan Dunyi, say that "Selected Yuan Operas" "does not have intense, rebellious, and nationalistic ideological consciousness," "we do not see bold and straightforward calls that alarmed and angered the Mongol Dynasty, as well as richer and stronger expressions of the people's character that are in line with the historical environment"; at the same time, he regards "Little Zhang the Butcher Burning His Son to Save His Mother," a bad play that promotes barbaric and cruel religious propaganda, as a treasure, and reverses right and wrong by saying that this is a work that is "closer to life and true reality"! - Because, according to the above logic, this is the only play that comes from "the people" and not from the "Imperial Library"!
    In fact, most of the scripts in "Selected Yuan Operas" are popular for their organic combination of strong popular character and perfect artistic description. These scripts are often good at vividly reflecting the authors' irreconcilable fighting spirit against the unjust in life, especially through lifelike images such as Li Kui, Dou E, and Bao Gong... these positive images are still well-known today. They strongly express their legitimate desire to break free from the brutal feudal rule and demand a reasonable life. The authors often ruthlessly lash out at and mock scoundrels like Wang Qinruo ("Xie Jinwu"), corrupt and tyrannical officials like Yang Jinwu ("Selling Grain in Chenzhou"), and traitors to the people like Cui Dianshi ("Xiao Xiang Rain"); the authors often treat the ruled and persecuted characters with the same warm concern as family members, such as Zhang Qiannu ("Qiannu's Soul Leaving Her Body"), who is under strict supervision, Zhang Cuiluan ("Xiao Xiang Rain"), who is abandoned, and Wu Zixu ("Wu Yuan Plays the Xiao"), who escapes death. The works often reveal a fervent longing and praise for many positive characters with exemplary roles in the history and legends of the motherland, such as Zhuge Liang and the Yang family generals. Although these views and desires about life are common to the people in China's long feudal society, in the Yuan Dynasty, when the people were suffering from brutal feudal oppression and national oppression, these views and desires about life could not but have greater clarity and positive significance.
    Therefore, when reading "Selected Yuan Operas," we cannot, like some people, explore the popular character and reality of the scripts from the images of the works, but adopt a simplified method to deal with this complex problem. In the eyes of some people, the popular character and reality of "Selected Yuan Operas" are only manifested in some words and sentences with implied or metaphorical nature; or in some words that directly discuss the sufferings of the people's livelihood, as well as in the depiction of "yanei" (sons of officials) and "lamb interest" (usury), these glimpses of the social life of the Yuan Dynasty in a few scripts. This view not only ignores the great significance of many scripts without the above-mentioned "special" words, but also makes it impossible to truly touch the comprehensive significance of those scripts with "special" words. Not to study the "people" in the works, but only to look for a character's one-sided words, in fact, proves that they are studying literary works with an anti-realist method, and they will never be able to understand the entire content of the works. Because realistic writers always reflect life and express their views on life through the creation of characters.
    Taking "Dou E's Injustice" as an example, Guan Hanqing created a typical character of a kind woman with national significance - Dou E's character in this immortal masterpiece. Dou E is a person who insists on living according to her own will; all of Zhang Donkey's persecution has not been able to change her. She is upright and unyielding. In front of the prefect, she "endured thousands of beatings and tortures, all kinds of humiliations, one blow down, a line of blood, a layer of skin," but she did not confess under torture. At the critical moment of life and death, she thought not of herself but of others: "Mother-in-law, if I don't die, how can I save you!" Dou E bravely sacrificed herself in order to save the lives of others. This tragic character, who is firm in the face of irresistible violence and dares to sacrifice herself, is in fact a true and concrete summary of the magnificent spirit of the Yuan Dynasty people's courage and unyieldingness. Tao Wu the prefect, Zhang Donkey, Sai Lu the doctor, and others who persecuted Dou E are characterized by barbarism, tyranny, greed, and rascality. The tragic conflict between Dou E and the Tao Wu prefect group is a vivid portrayal of Chinese society under the feudal rule of the Yuan Dynasty. "Dou E's Injustice" is not a Yuan Dynasty story, but Guan Hanqing truly reflected the dark reality of early Yuan society from the conflict of characters. Dou E has many endearing qualities. But such a kind and lovely person would "commit Wang Fa (law) for no reason" and be killed alive by Tao Wu the prefect and others. Guan Hanqing obviously used the character of Dou E, who was unjustly wronged, to expose the heinous crimes of the "Wang Fa" and its executors; therefore, he was able to shout: "Earth, you do not distinguish between good and bad, what is the earth for! Heaven, you wrongly examine the virtuous and foolish, what is the heaven for!" This fierce attack and protest against the dark feudal rule; therefore, he adopted the "June Snow" with a fantastic color, and arranged for Dou E's father to return to office and fairly handle this unjust case, to express his belief in life: unjust rule will inevitably fail, and righteous people will inevitably win. Guan Hanqing condemned the Tao Wu prefect group who persecuted the good people in the play, isn't this in line with the interests of the people who lived a dark life under the high-pressure rule of the Yuan Dynasty, isn't it a reflection of the people's desire for a reasonable life at that time? From here, the popular character of "Dou E's Injustice" lies not so much in directly describing how usury exploits the people, as it observes and describes life from the perspective of the painful and helpless people under the oppression of usury; it lies not so much in the play's satirical words such as "It is my parents who provide me with food and clothing to come to sue," but it reflects the interests and desires of the people who are ruled to the point of desperation by these prefects. And its higher expression of popular character lies in the fact that it creates an image of perseverance, unyieldingness, uprightness, kindness, and self-sacrifice - Dou E, through the image of Dou E, richly and vividly reveals the beautiful ideological and emotional realm of the medieval people.
    We cannot assume that the fact that many scripts in "Selected Yuan Operas" are about historical stories is a manifestation of the authors' desire to "escape from reality," and rashly conclude that they lack popular character and realistic significance. For example, in Ma Zhiyuan's "Autumn in the Han Palace," it is impossible to find anything that "implies" or "shadows" reality, and in terms of love, the author also treats the emperor as a sympathetic image, but these do not affect the fact that "Autumn in the Han Palace" is an excellent tragedy. Ma Zhiyuan described the sincere love of the kind and weak Emperor Yuan of the Han Dynasty; his purpose was to lash out at villains like Mao Yanshou through the destruction of this sympathetic love, and to ridicule the court officials who, at the moment of national honor, "pierced the goose's mouth like an arrow, and no one dared to cough." "In the future, there is no need for a court of civil and military officials, it is enough to rely on the beauty to pacify the world," Emperor Yuan of the Han Dynasty's indignation essentially embodies the author's own indignation at the historical batch of "officials who only accompanied the book in the center and ate, and never ruled the king for a day." Ma Zhiyuan changed Zhao Jun, who had already left the frontier in the legend, to Zhao Jun who refused to enter the frontier and threw herself into the river to die, the purpose is obviously to create this female image with national integrity, to contrast the shameful appearance of the civil and military officials who "worked hard to ask for royal pay" and humiliated the country and lost their power. Ma Zhiyuan tried his best to describe Emperor Yuan of the Han Dynasty's pain of missing Zhao Jun, which at the same time strongly satirized the corruption and incompetence of the civil and military officials - they couldn't even protect the emperor's concubine, let alone the country and the people? Ma Zhiyuan obviously dealt with the story of Zhao Jun leaving the frontier with a feeling of grief and indignation. Therefore, although the "Autumn in the Han Palace" does not mention the people, nor does it describe the reality of the early Yuan Dynasty, we can truly hear the voice of the people of Ma Zhiyuan's era commenting on history.
    Of course, "Dou E's Injustice" and "Autumn in the Han Palace" still need to be better analyzed. Here I want to emphasize that the popular character and reality of Yuan Dynasty zaju are often more complex, tortuous, and even quite hidden in their forms of expression. If you use a simplified method and do not start by analyzing the ideological tendencies revealed by the images of the works, it is impossible to truly see its popular character and realistic significance.
    While talking about the ideological content of many excellent scripts in "Selected Yuan Operas," it must be pointed out that their artistry is closely combined with strong ideological content. However, bourgeois scholars cannot explore, or even intentionally avoid, the ideological content of the works, but only appreciate the art of Yuan Dynasty zaju in isolation. Even the evaluation of Yuan opera by Wang Guowei, which has been regarded as a conclusion ever since liberation, is a prominent example. Wang Guowei's contribution to the study of Yuan opera cannot be erased, but he believes that the goodness of Yuan opera lies only in the article, and the goodness of the article lies only in "natural" ("History of Song and Yuan Drama"), but it cannot explain the true value of Yuan Dynasty zaju. Taking the following lyrics of Emperor Yuan of the Han Dynasty in "Autumn in the Han Palace," which Wang Guowei admired, as an example:
        ...He, he, he sadly bids farewell to the Han master, I, I, I hold hands on the He Liang. His troops enter the poor wilderness, my Luan Yu returns to Xianyang; returns to Xianyang, passes the palace wall; passes the palace wall, around the cloister; around the cloister, near the Pepper Room; near the Pepper Room, the moon is dim; the moon is dim, the night is cool; the night is cool, weeping cold insects; weeping cold insects, green gauze window; green gauze window, not thinking; ah, not thinking, except for a heart of iron; a heart of iron, also worried about tears dripping thousands of lines! ... Singing and standing for a long time, hesitating for a long time, suddenly listening to the wild geese flying south, the sound is loud; but it turns out that the eyes are full of cattle and sheep, it is the felt car that carries away the hate, resounding in the half-slope! Its goodness is actually not only in "writing about love is heart-wrenching, writing about scenery is in people's ears and eyes, and narrating things is like coming out of their mouths." Here, it is worth noting that Emperor Yuan of the Han Dynasty is expressing his full of parting sorrows and hates in front of the majestic civil and military officials, while watching his beloved concubine heading to the Huns. This scene is thought-provoking. If this group of well-off civil and military officials are not corrupt and incompetent pustules, then how could the emperor's concubine leave the frontier? How could Emperor Yuan of the Han Dynasty endure such heavy pain and attract such desolation? These meticulously portrayed and vividly expressed lyrics are in fact the most vivid rebuke and mockery of Mao Yanshou and incompetent officials. From here, when we read Yuan Dynasty zaju, to say that their goodness lies only in the "natural" article, isn't that like "buying the casket and returning the pearl"; the article of "Little Zhang the Butcher Burning His Son to Save His Mother" is also "natural," but it is seriously poisonous. It is obviously harmful to appreciate the article separately from the ideological content of a work.
    "Selected Yuan Operas" not only selected the works of famous writers such as Wang Shifu, Guan Hanqing, Bai Pu, Ma Zhiyuan, and Zheng Dehui, but also selected many important works by anonymous writers. Regarding these zaju authors, regardless of whether they are famous or anonymous, there are very few historical materials left, and their life stories remain to be studied. However, the thoughts and feelings of progressive Yuan Dynasty zaju authors are always in common with the vast oppressed people of the time. Some people believe that there was no imperial examination in the Yuan Dynasty, and scholars lacked a way to advance, and they were always depressed and underemployed, so "they generally used the words of immortals and Buddhas, chivalrous heroes, neighborhoods, men and women, to express their depressed and outspoken feelings of injustice." (Quoted from Wu Mei's "Preface to Lectures on Ci Yu") In other words, they were able to write many immortal scripts, as if it was merely the result of personal grievances being vented. This view is very incomplete. On the one hand, the Yuan Dynasty listed the Han Chinese, Jurchens, Khitans, and Southerners (the people who originally belonged to the Southern Song Dynasty) who originally belonged to the Jin Dynasty as the lower classes of the ruled, and on the other hand, the so-called "nine Confucian scholars and ten beggars" further demoted intellectuals to the lowest level of the ruled class. Not only did Han Chinese intellectuals have no way to advance, but the oppression they suffered was the most severe at the time. The "disappointed" playwrights themselves were in the most acute opposition to the ruling class, so their feelings about the lives of the ruled were particularly profound; they understood the feelings of the oppressed even more thoroughly; therefore, when they vented their "feelings of injustice," it was actually not just personal grievances, but became the spokesperson for the entire oppressed class. In addition, many scholars have always been enthusiastic about how the zaju writers were "fond of romance"; they said that Guan Hanqing himself claimed to be "the leader of the young men and the head of the prodigals." Of course, we don't have to cover up the unserious side of the lives of ancient writers, but it must be pointed out that the "brothel" life was by no means the entire life of Guan Hanqing; at the same time, the "brothel" was the most barbaric and cruel place for the feudal system to oppress women. A conscientious writer like Guan Hanqing, who had more contact with the dark "pit of traps," would naturally help him to more deeply understand the truth of life, experience the suffering of the oppressed, and become one with their feelings. It should be said that the close combination of ideas and feelings with the vast people is precisely the source of Guan Hanqing's creation.
    From what has been said above, whether it is about versions, content, or authors, if we do not take a scientific and realistic approach to "Selected Yuan Operas," then it is impossible to properly study or even read this treasure trove of zaju literature. This is a problem that deserves to be brought to the attention of readers when "Selected Yuan Operas" is reprinted and published.

### 关于对“元曲选”的评价

专栏：

    关于对“元曲选”的评价
    戴不凡
    “元曲选”是1616年由臧晋叔编刊的一部杂剧（13—14世纪最流行的戏曲形式）剧本选集。它包括100本作品。这些剧本科白俱全，内容完整，在文字上都经过校勘整理，并附有音释，是比较便于阅读的。在我国文学史上占有重要地位的元代杂剧剧本留传下来的不过130多本，“元曲选”一书就收了90多本。单从保存戏剧文献的意义看，臧晋叔搜罗选集的工作，也是很可贵的。
    迷信古本的学者们，向来轻视“元曲选”。像吴梅就以元刊本“古今杂剧”来证明臧晋叔把剧本“弄得一塌糊涂”（见“元曲研究ABC”）。这种说法是缺乏根据的。因为，“古今杂剧”和“元曲选”都收的剧本，基本内容并没有什么差别。曲文略有出入，不见得就是臧晋叔“妄删瞎改”的结果。（剧团和演员为了适应本身的条件，把剧词和内容稍加更动；或者在演出中丰富了原著，这都是极平常的事。）何况我们又无法证明“古今杂剧”一定就是作者的原本。对比一下出自“词山曲海”——李开先之家的“汉宫秋”第三折的曲文，不难发现“元曲选”的文学性还是比较高的。“古今杂剧”只有主角的科白较详，这是一种相当于京戏“单片儿”一样的本子，像关汉卿的“调风月”，读起来就非常费劲。出于“御戏监”本的“元曲选”，有如京戏的“总讲”，是完整的舞台演出本，比看“单片儿”方便得多。当然，“古今杂剧”也是一部有价值的文献，但是抱着版本愈古愈好的想法，以科白断烂不全的版本来贬低“元曲选”，那和教人不住高楼大厦而去住破落的古庙，是没有什么差别的。
    像严敦易先生那样，因为“元曲选”的来源是“御戏监”本（内府本），从而否定这部书的价值，（见“文学遗产”78期：严敦易“论元杂剧”）这更是不妥当的说法。我们如果稍为认真看一下“元曲选”的内容，那么，就不会像严敦易先生那样，说“元曲选”中“没有激烈的，反抗的，以及民族性的思想意识，”“不大看到使蒙古王朝惊惶忿怒的大胆直率的呼声，以及更丰富和更强烈的合于历史环境的人民性的表露”；同时却把“小张屠焚儿救母”这个作野蛮残酷宗教宣传的坏戏，视同珍宝地捧出来，颠倒是非地说这才是“比较更接近于生活和真实的现实”的作品！——因为，根据上述逻辑，这是唯一出于“民间”而不是出于“内府”的剧目啊！
    事实上，“元曲选”中的大部分剧本，都以它强烈的人民性和完美的艺术描写的有机结合而脍炙人口。这些剧本往往善于通过栩栩如生的形象，特别如李逵、窦娥、包公……这些至今仍然家喻户晓的正面形象，深刻地反映了作者们对生活中的不义者的不可调和的战斗精神，强烈地表现了他们挣脱残暴的封建统治以及要求合理生活的正当愿望。作者们往往无情地鞭笞和嘲讽像王钦若（“谢金吾”）这样的败类、杨金吾（“陈州糶粮”）这样的贪污横行者、崔甸士（“萧湘雨”）这样的人民叛徒；作者们又往往以家人父子一般的热切关怀，来对待被统治受迫害的人物，诸如被严密管教的张倩女（“倩女离魂”）、被遗弃的张翠鸾（“萧湘雨”）、死里逃生的伍子胥（“伍员吹箫”）这些不幸者的命运。作品中对于祖国历史、传说中许多具有典范作用的正面人物，如诸葛亮、杨家将等，往往流露了热烈向往和歌颂的心情。虽然，这些对生活的看法和愿望，是我国长时期封建社会中的人民所共同具有的；但是，在人民受着残暴的封建压迫和民族压迫下的元朝，这些对生活的看法和愿望就不能不具有更大的鲜明性和积极意义。
    因此，在阅读“元曲选”的时候，我们就不能像某些人那样，不从作品的形象中去探索剧本的人民性和现实性，而采用一种简单化的方法来对待这个复杂的问题。在某些人看来，“元曲选”的人民性和现实性，不过是表现在若干带有隐射、暗喻性质的词句上；或者某些直接议论到民生疾苦的字眼上，以及在少数剧本中描写了“衙内”“羊羔儿息”（高利贷）这些元代社会生活面貌的一鳞半爪而已。这种看法，不仅无视许多没有上述那些“特殊”字眼的剧本的巨大意义，而且也不可能真正接触具有“特殊”字眼的那些剧本的全面意义。不去研究作品中的“人”，而只去寻找一个人物的片言只语，事实上就证明他们是用反现实主义的方法来研究文艺作品的，他们永远无法理解作品的全部内容。因为，现实主义的作家永远是通过人物的创造，来反映生活，表现他们对生活的看法的。
    以“窦娥冤”来说，关汉卿在这本不朽的名著中，创造了一个有全民意义的善良妇女典型——窦娥的性格。窦娥是坚持按照自己的意志生活的人；张驴儿的一切迫害就没有能改变她。她是正直不屈的，在太守面前“捱千般打拷，万种凌逼，一杖下，一道血，一层皮”，可是并没有屈打成招。在生死关头，她想到的不是自己而是别人：“婆婆也，我若是不死呵，如何救得你！”窦娥是为了救别人性命才勇敢地自我牺牲的。这个在不可抗御的暴力面前坚定不移，勇于自我牺牲的悲壮性格，事实上正是元朝人民勇敢不屈的壮烈精神的真实具体的概括。迫害窦娥的桃杌太守、张驴儿、赛卢医等人，是以野蛮、横暴、贪婪、无赖为其特征的。窦娥和桃杌太守集团之间的悲剧性冲突，正是元朝封建统治下的我国社会一幅生动的写真。“窦娥冤”不是元朝故事，但是关汉卿却从人物性格的冲突中，无比真实地反映了元初社会的黑暗现实。窦娥身上具有很多令人喜爱的品质。可是这么一个善良可爱的人却会“莫来由犯王法”，却会被桃杌太守等活活杀死。关汉卿显然是用含冤莫伸的窦娥性格，来揭发“王法”及其执行者的滔天罪行的；因此，他才有可能喊出：“地也你不分好歹何为地！天也你错勘贤愚枉为天！”对昏天黑地的封建统治的这种猛烈抨击和抗议；因此，他才会采用带有幻想色彩的“六月雪”，安排窦娥的父亲做官回来公正地处理了这件冤案，来表达他对生活的信念：不义的统治必将失败，正义的人们必然会胜利。关汉卿在剧本中宣判了迫害善良者的桃杌太守集团，不正是符合元朝高压统治下，过着暗无天日生活的人民的利益，不正是当时人民对合理生活的愿望的反映吗？从这里来看，“窦娥冤”的人民性，与其说在于直接描写高利贷如何剥削人民，不如说它是以在高利贷压榨下的痛苦无告的人民的观点，来观察和描写生活；与其说在于剧中有“但来告状就是我衣食父母”这样讽刺太守的词句，不如说它反映了被这种太守们统治得走头无路的人民的利益和愿望。而它的更高度的人民性的表现，还在于它塑造了一个坚毅不屈、正直善良和富有自我牺牲精神的形象——窦娥，通过窦娥的形象，丰富而生动地揭开了中世纪人民优美的思想感情境界。
    我们不能因为“元曲选”中有许多剧本写的是历史故事，就认为这是作者想“逃避现实”的表现，贸然断定它们缺少人民性和现实意义。像马致远的“汉宫秋”，里面丝毫找不出什么“暗喻”或“影射”现实的东西，在爱情问题上作者还把皇帝作为使人同情的形象来处理，可是这些丝毫不影响“汉宫秋”是个出色的悲剧。马致远描写了既善良又软弱的汉元帝的真挚爱情；他的目的是通过这种令人同情的爱情遭受毁灭，鞭笞像毛延寿那样的奸人，嘲笑在有关国家荣誉的时刻，“似箭穿着雁口，没个人敢咳嗽”的满朝文武。“久以后也不用满朝文武，只凭佳人平定天下便了”，汉元帝的愤慨，实质上正体现了作者本人对历史上那批“只会中书陪伴食，何曾一日为君王”的无能官员们的愤慨。马致远把传说中已经出塞的昭君，改为不肯入番投江而死的昭君，目的显然是创造这位富有民族气节的女性形象，来反衬只会“干请了皇家俸”的、辱国丧权的文武官员的可耻面貌。马致远竭力描绘汉元帝思念昭君的痛苦，这同时也就有力地嘲讽了满朝文武官员的腐化无能——他们连皇帝的妃子也保不住，何况国家和人民呢？马致远在处理昭君出塞的故事时，显然带着一种悲愤的心情。因此，“汉宫秋”中虽然没有出现人民，也没有描写元初的现实，但是我们却能真切地听到马致远时代人民评论历史的声音。
    当然，对“窦娥冤”、“汉宫秋”还有待于更好地分析，这里我想着重说明的是：元人杂剧的人民性和现实性，表现形态往往是比较复杂、曲折甚至是相当隐蔽的。如果用简单化的方法，不从分析作品形象所流露的思想倾向入手，那是不可能真正看出它的人民性和现实意义的。
    在谈到“元曲选”中许多优秀剧本的思想性的同时，不能不指出，它们的艺术性，是和强烈的思想内容紧密地结合在一起的。但是，资产阶级的学者们却不可能探索甚至是有意地回避作品的思想内容，只是孤立地去欣赏元人杂剧的艺术。甚至在解放以后还一直被人奉为定论的王国维对元曲的评价，就是一个突出的例子。王国维研究元曲之功是不可抹杀的，但是他认为元曲的好处只在文章，而文章之好只是在于“自然而已矣”（“宋元戏曲史”），却不能说明元人杂剧的真正价值。即以王国维所欣赏的“汉宫秋”中汉元帝的下列唱词来说：
        ……他他他伤心辞汉主，我我我携手上河梁。他部从入穷荒
    ，我銮舆返咸阳；返咸阳，过宫墙；过宫墙，绕回廊；绕回廊，
    近椒房；近椒房，月昏黄；月昏黄，夜生凉；夜生凉，泣寒螀；
    泣寒螀，绿纱窗；绿纱窗，不思量；呀，不思量，除是铁心肠；
    铁心肠，也愁泪滴千行！……唱道伫立多时，徘徊半响，猛听的
    塞雁南翔，呀呀的声嘹亮；却原来满目牛羊，是那载离恨的毡车
    ，半坡里响！它的好处实际上并不止在于“写情则沁人心脾，写景则在人耳目，述事则如其口出”。这里，值得注意的是：汉元帝是当着威风浩荡的文武百官面前，在目送他的爱妃走向匈奴，在发抒他满腔离愁别恨的。这个场景是可以发人深思的。如果这批养尊处优的文武百官不是腐化无能的脓包的话，那么，怎么会让皇帝的妃子出塞呢？汉元帝又怎么会挨受这般沉重的痛苦，招来如此的凄凉呢？这些刻画入微、淋漓尽致的唱词，事实上正是对毛延寿以及无能官员们最生动的斥责和嘲骂。从这里来看，我们读元人杂剧时，说它们的好处只在于文章“自然”，那不是像“买椟还珠”一样吗；“小张屠焚儿救母”文章也是“自然”的，可是它却是有严重毒素的。撇开一部作品的思想内容而单独地去欣赏文章，显然是有害的。
    “元曲选”不仅选收了王实甫、关汉卿、白朴、马致远、郑德辉等著名作家的作品，而且也选收了不少无名氏的重要作品。关于这些杂剧作者，不问是有名或无名可稽的，留传下来的史料都很少，他们的生平还有待研究。不过，进步的元代杂剧作者的思想感情总是有着同当时被压迫的广大人民相通之处的。有人认为元朝没有科举，士人缺少上进的道路，终身沉抑下僚，于是 “大率假仙佛任侠里巷男女之辞，以舒其抑塞磊落不平之气。”（引自吴梅“词余讲义”序）换句话说，他们能写出许多不朽的剧本，好像仅仅是由于个人牢骚发泄的结果。这种看法是很不全面的。元朝一方面把原属金朝的汉人，女真人，契丹人和南人（原属南宋的人民）列为被统治的下等人，另一方面，所谓“九儒十丐”，更把知识分子贬到被统治阶级的最下层去。汉族知识分子不但没有上进的道路，而且所受的压迫，在当时是最剧烈的。“不得志”的剧作家们自己就处在同统治阶级最尖锐对立的地位上，因而他们对被统治的生活，感受格外深刻；对被压迫者的心情，了解得更为透彻；于是，他们发泄“不平之气”时，实际上就不只是个人的牢骚，而成为整个被压迫阶级的代言人了。另外，历来也有许多学者津津乐道杂剧作家们如何“留恋风月”；他们说，关汉卿就自称是“郎君领袖，浪子班头”。当然，我们不必为古代作家生活的不严肃一面作掩饰，但是，必须指出，“行院”生活决不是关汉卿的全部生活；同时，“行院”又是封建制度压迫妇女最野蛮残酷的所在，像关汉卿这样有良心的作家，同黑暗的“陷人坑”有较多的接触，自然会帮助他更深刻地理解生活的真相，体验被压迫者的痛苦，同她们的心情打成一片。应当说，跟广大人民思想感情的紧密结合，这正是关汉卿创作的泉源。
    从上面所说的来看，不论是对版本、对内容、对作者，如果我们不采取科学的，实事求是的方法来看“元曲选”，那么，决不可能好好地研究甚至阅读这部杂剧文学的宝库的。在“元曲选”重印出版的时候，这是值得提供读者们注意的问题。
