At the welcoming event, Kubota Mantaro said that it was rare to see such a broad representation of various sectors gathered together in Japan, which demonstrated the Japanese people's warm feelings towards welcoming the Chinese Beijing Opera Delegation. On behalf of all sectors in Japan, he expressed gratitude to the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries for sending such an excellent Beijing Opera Delegation to perform in Japan.

Subsequently, Head of the Delegation Mei Lanfang delivered a reply, expressing gratitude to the Japanese representatives for holding the grand banquet to welcome the Chinese Beijing Opera Troupe.

The banquet proceeded in an atmosphere of closeness and friendship. Suzuki Mosaburo, Kitamura Tokutaro, and many others spoke in succession. Ms. Yamamoto Yasue, a famous actress in the Japanese Shingeki (New Theatre) movement, said excitedly: Although diplomatic relations between Japan and China have not yet been normalized, our hearts are connected. We must promote the normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and China on the basis of strengthening artistic and cultural exchange.

The famous Kabuki actor Ichikawa Sarunosuke and sixty members of his troupe also attended the welcoming banquet. They all stood up to express their gratitude for the warm welcome the Japanese Kabuki troupe received from the Chinese people during their visit to China. Ichikawa Sarunosuke said: When we performed in China, we forgot that we were performing abroad; because the hearts of the audience were intertwined with our hearts. This time, when the Chinese Beijing Opera Troupe performs in Japan, they will also be able to see the same situation.

Finally, Ouyang Yuqian, First Deputy Head of the Chinese Beijing Opera Troupe, delivered a speech. He recalled the exchanges between the theatrical circles of China and Japan over the past few decades. He said: For the benefit of the people of China and Japan, friendly cooperation is necessary and in line with the aspirations of the people of both countries. Although there are still some difficulties, the hearts of the people of the two countries have already been exchanged, and no force can stop this. He called on the dramatists of China and Japan to clasp hands tightly.

On the morning of the 29th, Mei Lanfang and Ouyang Yuqian visited Kang Mingqiu, President of the Tokyo Overseas Chinese Association, and met with representatives of Overseas Chinese from various regions, sharing lunch together.
