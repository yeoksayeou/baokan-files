    Further Implement the Policy of Developing Minority Languages
    Mongolian Language Family Symposium Held in Hohhot

    The Mongolian Language Family Scientific Symposium opened in Hohhot on the morning of the 22nd. It was jointly convened by the Preparatory Office of the Institute of Minority Languages of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Mongolian Language Reform Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

    Ha Feng'a, Vice Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Director of the Mongolian Language Reform Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, delivered the opening speech. He said that this meeting was convened to further implement the central government's policy on developing minority languages and to better carry out investigation and research work on Mongolian language family languages and scripts. The meeting will discuss the reform of Mongolian script and the promotion of the New Mongolian script, and also exchange opinions on the investigation, research, and script creation of other languages in the Mongolian language family.

    Wu Yuzhang, Director of the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, came to Hohhot from Beijing to guide the meeting. He spoke at the meeting. He said that the Mongolian people have long had the desire to reform their script, but only today, when the people have seized power, is it possible to reform the script. The Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government have always attached importance to helping fraternal nationalities create and reform scripts. The preliminary plan for minority language work formulated at last year's National Language Science Symposium stipulated that the Fifth Working Team should be organized to specifically be responsible for the investigation and research of Mongolian, Daur, Dongxiang, Bonan, and Tu languages, and to assist in the reform of the Mongolian script. Representatives of various ethnic groups in the Mongolian language family—Mongolian, Daur, Dongxiang, Bonan, and Tu—are participating in this meeting, which is beneficial to the broad exchange of experiences and the broad exchange of opinions on the investigation, research, and script creation of other languages in the Mongolian language family.

    进一步贯彻执行发展少数民族语文的政策 
    蒙古语族语言讨论会在呼和浩特举行
    蒙古语族语言科学讨论会二十二日上午在呼和浩特开会。这是由中国科学院少数民族语言研究所筹备处和内蒙古自治区蒙古文字改革委员会联合召开的。
    内蒙古自治区副主席、内蒙古自治区蒙古文字改革委员会主任哈丰阿致开幕词。他说，这次会议是为进一步贯彻中央关于发展少数民族语文政策和更好地开展蒙古语族语言文字的调查研究工作而召开的，会上将讨论蒙古文字的改革和推广新蒙文的问题，还要对蒙古语族其他语言的调查研究和文字创立问题交换意见。
    中国文字改革委员会主任吴玉章，从北京到呼和浩特来指导这次会议。他在会上讲了话。他说，蒙古族人民很早就有改革自己文字的愿望，但是，只有在人民掌握了政权的今天，才有改革文字的可能。中国共产党和中央人民政府一向重视帮助兄弟民族创立文字和改革文字的工作。去年召开的民族语文科学讨论会制定的关于少数民族语文工作初步规划中，曾规定组织第五工作队专门负责蒙古、达呼尔、东乡、保安和土族等语言的调查研究和协助进行蒙文的改革工作。这次会议有蒙古语族的各族：蒙古、达呼尔、东乡、保安、土族的代表参加，对广泛交流经验以及对蒙古语族其他语言的调查研究和文字创立问题广泛地交换意见是有益的。
