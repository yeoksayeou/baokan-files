The Soviet and Czech Republics Establish Diplomatic Relations with Cambodia Respectively

    Moscow Dispatch of this Newspaper, May 18th – Moscow newspapers today published a communique stating that the Soviet Union and the Kingdom of Cambodia have decided to establish diplomatic relations and exchange diplomatic representatives at the level of Ambassadors Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary. The communique pointed out, "The governments of the two countries hope that the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Cambodia will promote international cooperation and consolidate world peace."
    "Pravda" and "Red Star" both published articles welcoming the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and this country, which had long been under colonial oppression and gained national independence in 1954 due to the Geneva Accords on the Indochina issue.
    Badulin wrote in "Pravda": "Although Cambodia signed a military aid agreement with the United States, Cambodia believes that it must defend its sovereignty under all circumstances. The Cambodian government has repeatedly declared that it will firmly pursue a strict policy of neutrality. Despite the constant attempts of American diplomats to drag Cambodia into the Southeast Asia aggressive military bloc, the Cambodian government has resolutely refused to have anything to do with this military bloc." The author also listed the efforts of the government headed by Sihanouk to develop friendly relations with Asian countries, especially with India and the People's Republic of China.
    The new Prime Minister, Khim Tit, has stated that his government will continue to implement the policies put forward by Sihanouk.
    The author concluded: "The Cambodian people and government are fully determined to pursue a neutral policy based on friendly cooperation and peaceful coexistence. The people of Asia and all peace-loving people express sympathy with the Cambodian people and demand an immediate end to imperialist oppression of this country."
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 18th – According to a report by the Czechoslovak News Agency on the 17th, the government of the Czechoslovak Republic and the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia have decided to establish diplomatic relations and exchange diplomatic envoys. The governments of the two countries hope to develop bilateral relations based on the principles of the United Nations Charter and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

    苏捷两国分别同柬埔寨建交
    本报莫斯科18日电　莫斯科各报今天发表了苏联和柬埔寨王国决定建立外交关系并互派特命全权大使级外交代表的公报。公报指出，“两国政府希望，苏联和柬埔寨外交关系的建立将促进国际合作和巩固世界和平。”
    “真理报”和“红星报”都为此发表了专文，欢迎苏联同这个曾经长期处在殖民主义压迫之下而在1954年由于关于印度支那问题的日内瓦协定而取得国家独立的国家建立外交关系。
    巴杜林在“真理报”上写道：“虽然柬埔寨曾和美国签订了军事援助协定，但是柬埔寨无论如何都认为必须保卫自己的主权。柬埔寨政府屡次宣布，它将坚定地奉行严格的中立政策。尽管美国外交家不断地想把柬埔寨拖进东南亚侵略军事集团，柬埔寨政府坚决地拒绝同这个军事集团发生关系。”作者并列举了以西哈努克为首的政府同亚洲各国、特别是同印度和中华人民共和国发展友好关系的努力。
    新首相钦·迪曾经表明它的政府仍将执行西哈努克所提出的政策。
    作者最后说：“柬埔寨人民和政府有充分决心奉行基于友好合作和和平共处的中立政策。亚洲人民和一切爱好和平的人民对柬埔寨人民表示同情，并要求立刻制止帝国主义对这个国家的压迫。”
    新华社布拉格18日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社十七日报道，捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府和柬埔寨王国政府决定建立外交关系并且互换外交使节。两国政府希望以联合国宪章的原则和和平共处五项原则为基础发展两国的关系。
