    Adopting New Techniques for Planting Flue-Cured Tobacco
    Farmers in the Xuchang Special District of Henan Province, a famous flue-cured tobacco production area, are universally adopting advanced tobacco planting techniques such as seedling transplantation and high-ridge tobacco planting this year. In order to achieve an average yield of 447 jin of tobacco leaves per mu, the Xinghuo First Collective Farm in Xuchang County has changed its past practice of direct sowing in the fields. The farm members are starting tobacco seedlings in seedbeds, preparing to transplant them into the tobacco fields.

    采用新技术栽烤烟
    著名的烤烟产地——河南省许昌专区的农民，今年普遍采用育苗移栽和高畦栽烟的先进栽烟技术。许昌县星火第一集体农庄为了争取平均每亩产四百四十七斤烟叶，改变了过去直接往田里播种的习惯。庄员们正在苗床上起烟苗，准备往烟田里移栽。
