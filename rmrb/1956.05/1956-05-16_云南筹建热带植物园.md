    Yunnan Preparing to Build a Tropical Botanical Garden
    Yunnan Province, which is rich in tropical plants, is preparing to build a tropical botanical garden. A survey team dispatched by the Kunming Working Station of the Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has recently arrived in the tropical region of southern Yunnan. Under the guidance of Chinese and Soviet experts, they will survey and select an ideal site for the garden.
    The planned area of the botanical garden is initially set at 5,000 mu (approximately 823 acres). In addition to cultivating more than 2,000 species of tropical higher plants already discovered in Yunnan Province, it also plans to introduce some tropical plant varieties from abroad. More than ten kinds of economically valuable tropical crops, such as cinchona, coffee, and sisal, which are already being cultivated in Yunnan Province, will become the focus of the botanical garden's future cultivation and research.

    云南筹建热带植物园
    盛产热带植物的云南省正在筹建一个热带植物园。由中国科学院植物研究所昆明工作站派出的一个勘查组已在最近到达云南南部的热带地区，他们将在中国和苏联专家的指导下，勘查和选择一个理想的园址。
    植物园面积初步确定为五千市亩，园里除了计划培育云南省内已发现的二千多种热带高等植物外，还准备从国外引进一部分热带植物品种。云南省目前已经开始栽培的金鸡纳、咖啡、剑麻等十多种有经济价值的热带作物将成为植物园今后培育和研究的重点。　（新华社）
