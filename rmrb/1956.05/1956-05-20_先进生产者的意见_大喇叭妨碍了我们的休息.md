    Advanced Producers' Opinions
    Loudspeakers Disturb Our Rest
    Li Zhanhai, representative to the National Conference of Advanced Producers and shift director of the Iron Smelting Workshop of the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant, reports: Wired broadcasting in the Ma'anshan mining area disrupts workers' lives and affects their rest.

    Establishing wired broadcasting in the mining area to conduct propaganda and education and to enliven the cultural and recreational life of employees is naturally a good thing. However, the content of the broadcasts and the broadcasting times should suit the needs of the employees. How is the broadcasting work being done in the Ma'anshan mining area now? Every day at six or seven in the morning, from twelve noon to two-thirty in the afternoon, and after six-thirty in the evening, the loudspeakers blare, playing either songs or operas, and the volume is so loud; in addition, the loudspeakers play music during work break exercises.

    This approach may be suitable for office workers, but it makes the workers suffer. The factory work is done in three shifts, and workers sleep at different times. Every time the loudspeakers sound, there are always workers sleeping. After working hard, the workers just want to rest well, but the loudspeakers make it impossible for them to sleep.

    According to representatives Zhang Yangkai, Wang Linghao, and others attending the Advanced Producers' Conference, similar situations exist in Daye and Anshan.

    It is hoped that the relevant leading organs in various industrial and mining areas will examine the work of wired broadcasting, rationally arrange broadcasting times and broadcasting scope, and not allow the sound of the loudspeakers to interfere with the workers' rest.

### 先进生产者的意见  大喇叭妨碍了我们的休息

    先进生产者的意见
    大喇叭妨碍了我们的休息
    全国先进生产者代表会议代表、马鞍山铁厂炼铁车间值班主任李占海反映：马鞍山矿区的有线广播扰乱了工人的生活，影响了工人的休息。
    在矿区设立有线广播，来进行宣传教育和活跃职工的文化娱乐生活，这自然是件好事情。可是，广播的内容和播送的时间应该适合职工的需要。现在在马鞍山矿区的广播工作是怎么搞的呢？每天早晨六、七点，中午十二点到下午两点半和下午六点半以后，大喇叭就响了，放的不是歌子就是戏，声音又是那末响；此外，在做工间操的时候大喇叭也要唱上一阵。
    这样的做法对职员们可能是适宜的，但是可使工人遭了殃。厂里的工作是三班倒，工人们睡觉的时间不一样。每次大喇叭响的时候，总有工人在睡觉。工人们辛勤劳动以后，正想好好休息，却被大喇叭吵得没法睡觉。
    据出席先进生产者代表会议的张扬凯、王凌好等代表反映，在大冶和鞍山也有类似情况。
    希望各工矿区的有关领导机关检查一下有线广播的工作，合理地安排广播时间和播送范围，不要让大喇叭的响声妨碍了工人的休息。
