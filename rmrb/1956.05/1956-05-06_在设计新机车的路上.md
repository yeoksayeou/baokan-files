On the Road to Designing New Locomotives
　　Our reporter Liu Heng
　　In the winter of 1954, Song Weiren, the head of the technology section of the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant, received a new task: to transform the technology section into a design section and design a new "1-5-1" type freight locomotive. At first, Song Weiren was overjoyed! China has had trains for more than eighty years. There are no less than a hundred types of locomotives. However, all of them are foreign-made. China has not designed its own yet. These foreign locomotives—take the most numerous "EK-1" for example, some people call it the "universal locomotive." No matter the weather, hot or cold, or the quality of the coal, it can run and go. As for whether it can pull more, run faster, save coal, and be safe, it doesn't care. Song Weiren had long thought quietly: "When will our country be able to design a new locomotive based on its own specific conditions?" Now, that time has come!
　　However, when he thought about the design task falling on his shoulders, Song Weiren began to worry: "This is something we've never done before, can we do it?" Wu Min, the secretary of the factory's Party committee, saw his concern and said to him, "Since liberation, how many things haven't we done before, but we did them anyway, didn't we? The country needs new locomotives, we should treat it as a political task to complete." Deputy Secretary Zhang Chajin also came to encourage him: "Many hands make light work, there's nothing we can't do! Besides, there will be Soviet experts coming to help..."
　　In November, the technology section was transformed into the design section. Before, the entire section had twenty-odd people, all sitting in one room, and you could see everyone as soon as you opened your eyes. Everyone could hear you as soon as you spoke. Now—great! It suddenly increased to more than a hundred people, occupying one and a half floors. The personnel came from all directions, and they all looked at Song Weiren, waiting for him in their hearts. But what about Song Weiren? He was also waiting in his heart, waiting for the Soviet experts to bring help.
　　Soon, the Soviet locomotive design expert Abramov arrived. He did bring a lot of help. The biggest help of all was breaking Song Weiren's idea of solely relying on experts.
　　Once, they handed a well-designed blueprint to the expert, asking him to review it and make some corrections with a red pen. But it didn't work! The expert stopped them, asking them to talk about why they designed it this way? What were the bases for doing so? What were the good and bad points of it? After they finished talking, he returned the blueprint to them, asking them to revise it themselves. The expert said, "The people of every country should learn to use their own brains and hands to design things for their own country. If you want to learn, you have to do everything yourself."
　　After returning, Song Weiren thought about it for a long time. He said to himself: "We are carrying two burdens on our two shoulders! We are not only going to design the locomotive, but also cultivate a group of locomotive design talents through locomotive design. How can we complete such a major task without using our brains and doing it ourselves?"
　　Once, when designing the ash pan, they saw that the volume was smaller than the Soviet one. Everyone thought it was inappropriate. The expert said, "The width of the Soviet rails and the size of the bridges are different from yours, what basis do you have for saying it's small?" Song Weiren sent two comrades to take the train, running from Dalian to Shenyang, and then from Shenyang back to Dalian, measuring all the way on the train: how much freight was pulled, how much coal was burned, and how much ash was produced. After calculating, the ash pan was not small! Another time, the boiler group calculated the distance between the stay bolts. It would have been perfectly acceptable to have a distance of one hundred millimeters, but because they saw that the distance between the two stay bolts of the new Soviet locomotive was at most ninety-five millimeters, they also designed it to be ninety-five millimeters. The expert said, "The Soviet specifications are not immutable, if you really have sufficient basis, you can still change it." Later, they changed it to one hundred millimeters, saving a lot of stay bolts.
　　From then on, Song Weiren and the designers also understood: "In front of designers, there are no insurmountable difficulties, but there are also no difficulties that can be overcome without effort. Everything must proceed from the actual situation of our country, act according to science, and not blindly copy foreign things."
　　All the people in the design section were students. When they started designing, they all liked to simply use theoretical calculation methods, wanting to derive an ideal locomotive size from the calculations. The expert pointed out: "This is the method of doing research work. The designer's working method is to start with studying the existing good locomotives at home and abroad." Therefore, everyone closely contacted the Ministry of Railways, the Dalian Railway Research Institute, and the locomotive depots in Shenyang, Jinzhou, etc., making friends with drivers, markers, and pattern makers, asking them for opinions and providing information. Everyone also learned Russian and looked for reference books. Originally, everyone looked at Russian books like reading pictures to recognize characters. Now, many comrades can understand them. The expert said, "You have to run through the wheat fields to find which ear of wheat is the best." Everyone looked for all the locomotive data they could find in order to design the best locomotive.
　　The people of the entire section were divided into eight professional groups according to the parts of the locomotive, such as boilers and steam engines, with three additional groups attached. Originally, everyone was not very clear about what each group did. Therefore, no matter which group they were assigned to, they all felt fresh and happy, and when they worked, they didn't go out to play even on Sundays or during the Spring Festival. However, as time went on, some people slowly lost interest in their work: "What's so good about learning about coal water tank boiler skins and driver's cabins? It's better to work on machinery, which can improve technology." They requested job transfers. Comrade Wu Min helped everyone to see things in the right way: "A watch cannot lack a gear, and a locomotive cannot lack a part. A gear cannot be missing a tooth, and everyone's work is like the teeth of a gear." Song Weiren also often talked to everyone: "No matter what the job is, it depends on everyone's cooperation. At the same time, no matter what the job is, as long as you delve into it, there is a lot to learn. If the boiler skin is to be designed in a streamlined shape, it is impossible without understanding fluid mechanics. The driver's cabin is to be made of thin plates. It is not easy to do well without understanding the stress calculation of thin plates."
　　Song Weiren also had everyone make a model of the driver's room, the same size and equipment as the driver's room. In the past, the driver's room of the EK-1 locomotive had tiny windows, and sunlight could not shine in. The doors and windows also leaked air on all sides, and the driver was prone to catching a cold. What about the driver's room of the new locomotive? It is solid and reliable, with large windows, and double-layered glass. In winter, heating is provided in the middle. In the driver's room of the EK-1 locomotive, the place where the instruments are placed is often blocked by things like boilers. When the driver is driving, if he wants to look at the instruments, sometimes he has to stand up. What about the driver's room of the new locomotive? The instruments are placed in the right place, and when people sit and drive, they can see them at a glance. Everyone also invited many drivers to come in and sit. Let them give their opinions on the height of the seats, the position of various handles, the color of the walls, etc. The comrades felt that making the driver's cabin was not simple. There were many details and a lot to learn, and everyone's spirits were high.
　　In the past, the main task of the technology section was to repair and assemble locomotives. If a part was missing, they would design a new one according to the old design, draw a drawing, and add it. Now, designing the entire locomotive, when drawing parts and components, also requires understanding their position in the entire locomotive and their relationship with the surrounding parts and components. This requires a high degree of cooperation between groups and between people. For example, the person designing the spring must not only consider the spring's drawing, but also consider the spring's position on the locomotive and the surrounding parts and components. If the spring moves, will it affect other parts and components, etc. During the design process, everyone demonstrated a spirit of collectivism. Not only did they consider not hindering others, but they also tried their best to create favorable working conditions and benefits for others.
　　Once, they encountered another problem: the main parts such as the boiler, steam engine, and vehicle frame were all designed separately. When they put them together for the entire vehicle weight distribution calculation, they found that the entire locomotive was light in the front and heavy in the back, which did not meet the requirements. After research, it was decided to have the boiler group rework it. The boiler itself was a very good boiler, but reworking it was so upsetting! Some comrades could not see things in the right way, and at that time, the comrades in the vehicle frame group and the steam engine group felt very embarrassed, as if they were sorry for the boiler group. Song Weiren was also worried in his heart, afraid of affecting the comrades' morale. However, expert Abramov said decisively: "We must resolutely rework, and we must rework quickly!" Song Weiren immediately understood: this was not a question of who was right and who was wrong, nor was it a question of taking care of the comrades' morale. For the sake of overall interests, under the leadership of group leader Chen Xianzhang, the boiler group quickly reworked. Not only did everyone not affect their morale, but they also received a very profound education: "The boiler is a good boiler, but if the entire locomotive is not easy to use, can we say that this is a good locomotive?"
　　The basic construction drawings of the "1-5-1" new type freight locomotive were designed on March 15, three and a half months ahead of schedule. It is better than the existing locomotives in China. Let's just compare it with the EK-1: the metal materials it uses (per unit wheel circumference horsepower) are 28% less than the EK-1, and the coal consumption per 10,000 ton-kilometers is 42% less, but its traction force (on a 6‰ gradient, at a speed of 20 kilometers/hour) is 41% greater. Now, many people in the design section have gone down to the workshop, cooperating with the factory workers to prepare for the successful trial production of the first new locomotive, as a gift for this year's National Day. Everyone is happy about the successful design of the new locomotive, especially because everyone feels that they have improved not only in business but also in ideology during the design process.

### 在设计新机车的路上

　　在设计新机车的路上
    本报记者　刘衡
    1954年冬天，大连机车车辆制造厂技术科科长宋伟仁接到了一个新任务：把技术科改成设计科，设计出“1—5—1”新型货运机车来。乍一听，宋伟仁好不欢喜！咱们中国出现火车，也有八十多年历史了。按机车的种类，不下百多种。可是，不论哪一种，都是外国货。咱们中国自己设计的，还没有一台。这些外国机车——就拿数量最多的冖丂1来说吧，有的人把它叫做“万能机车”。不管这个国家天气冷热，煤的质量好坏，它都能开能走。至于走起来是不是能够拉多、跑快、省煤、安全，它就不管了。宋伟仁早就悄悄想过：“什么时候咱们国家能够根据自己的具体情况，设计一种新机车呢？”现在，这个时候已经到了！
    可是，一想到这个设计任务是落在自己头上，宋伟仁又发了愁：“这是从没做过的事，咱们做得了吗？”厂的党委书记巫敏看出了他的心事，对他说：“解放以来，有多少没做过的事，咱们不都做了吗？国家需要新机车，应该把它当作政治任务来完成。”副书记张察金也跑来鼓励：“人多成龙，没有做不了的事！何况，还有苏联专家要来……”
    十一月，技术科改成了设计科。以前，全科二十几个人，一间房子全坐下了，一睁眼，全都看见了。一张嘴，全都听见了。现在——好！一下子增加到一百多人，占了一层半楼。人员来自四面八方，他们都把眼睛望着宋伟仁，都在心里等着他。可是，宋伟仁呢，他心里也在等，他在等苏联专家带来帮助。
    不久，苏联机车设计专家阿布拉莫夫来了。他的确带来了许多帮助。其中最大最大的一个帮助是：打破了宋伟仁单纯依赖专家的思想。
    有一次，他们把一张设计好的图纸交给专家，请他审查，用红笔改一改。可是，不行！专家把他们喊住，要他们谈谈为什么要这样设计？有什么根据？它好在何处，坏在哪里？谈完了，就把图纸还给他们，要他们自己修改。专家说：“每个国家的人民应该学会用自己的脑子、自己的手设计自己国家的东西。要想学会，一切都要亲自去做。”
    回去之后，宋伟仁想了很久。他对他自己说：“我们两个肩膀挑的是两付担子呀！我们不光光是要把机车设计出来。而且要通过机车设计，培养一批设计机车的人才。不用脑子，不自己动手怎能完成这样重大的任务呢？”
    有一次设计灰箱。一看，容积比苏联的要小。大家认为不合适了。专家说：“苏联钢轨宽窄、桥梁大小都跟你们的不一样，你们根据什么说它小？”宋伟仁就派两位同志坐上火车，从大连跑到沈阳，又从沈阳跑回大连，一路在车子上量：牵引多少重的货车跑了多少路，烧了多少煤，出了多少灰。回来一计算，灰箱并不小！又有一次锅炉小组计算螺撑之间的距离。本来相距一百公厘满可以，因为看见苏联新型机车的两个螺撑之间顶多只相距九十五公厘，他们也设计成九十五公厘。专家说：“苏联的规格不是一成不变的，如果你们真正有充分根据，还是可以改的。”后来他们就改成一百公厘，节省了好多螺撑。
    从此宋伟仁和设计师们又懂得了：“在设计师面前，没有克服不了的困难，可是，也没有不费力气就能克服的困难。一切都要根据本国实际情况出发，按照科学办事，不能死搬硬套外国东西。”
    设计科的人全是学生出身，开始设计，都爱单纯采用理论计算的方法，想在计算中得出一个理想的机车尺寸。专家指出：“这是作研究工作的方法。设计师的工作方法是从研究现有国内外较好的机车着手。”于是，大伙儿就跟铁道部、大连铁道研究所、沈阳、锦州等机务段密切联系，跟司机、划线工、木型工交朋友，要他们提意见，供给资料。大伙儿还学俄文，找参考书。原先大家都像看图识字样地看俄文书。到现在很多同志能看得懂了。专家说：“要跑遍麦田，才能找到哪棵麦穗是最好的。”大伙儿就找遍所有能找到的机车资料，好设计出最好的一台机车来。
    全科的人按照机车的部位分成锅炉、汽机等八个专业组，另外附设三个组。原先，大家对哪个组做哪些事，都闹不详细。因此，不管分到哪个组，都感到新鲜、欢喜，工作起来，连星期天、春节都不出去玩。可是，日子一久，慢慢就有些人对自己的工作兴趣不大了：“煤水车锅炉皮、司机小房子有啥好学的？不如搞机械，能提高技术。”他们要求调动工作。巫敏同志就帮助大家打通思想：“一个表不能缺少一个齿轮，一个机车也不能缺少一个部件。齿轮不能少掉一颗牙，咱们每个人的工作就像齿轮的牙。”宋伟仁也经常跟大家谈：“不管什么工作，都靠大家来合作。同时，不管什么工作，只要钻进去，学问都不小。锅炉皮如果要设计成流线型的，不懂流体力学，是不行的。司机小房子，要用薄板子造。不懂薄板应力计算，也不容易作好。”
    宋伟仁还让大家做了一个司机房的模型，跟司机房一样大小，一样设备，过去冖丂1机车的司机房，一点点小窗户，阳光照不进去。门窗还四面透风，司机容易受寒。新机车的司机房呢？严严实实，安了大窗子，还是双层玻璃，到了冬天，就在当间通上暖气。冖丂1机车司机房，仪表放的地方，往往被锅炉等东西挡住。司机开车，要看仪表，有时候还得站起身来。新机车的司机房呢？仪表放的正是地方，人坐着开车，一抬眼就看见了。大家还请许多司机进来坐坐。让他们对坐位的高低，各种把手的位置，墙壁的颜色等等提出意见。同志们感到搞司机小房子并不简单，里头有好多讲究，好多学问，情绪都高了。
    以前，技术科的工作主要是搞机车修配。缺什么零件，照旧的设计一个，画出图来，补充上去就行了。如今搞整个机车的设计，画零件、部件的时候，还要了解它们在整个机车的位置，以及它们同周围零、部件的关系。这就要求组与组之间、人与人之间，要有高度的合作精神。比方，设计弹簧的人，他不光要考虑弹簧的图样，而且要考虑弹簧在机车上的位置，以及它周围的零、部件。弹簧动了，会不会影响其他零、部件等等。在设计的时候，每个人都表现了集体主义精神。不光考虑到不要妨害别人，而且尽力想法给别人带来工作的有利条件和好处。
    有一次，他们又碰到一个难题：锅炉、汽机、车架等主要部分都分别设计好了。凑在一块进行全车重量分配计算，发见整个机车前轻后重，不符合要求。研究结果，就决定让锅炉组返工。锅炉本身倒是个挺好挺好的锅炉，可是要返工，这多叫人心烦！有个别同志在思想上搞不通，当时，车架组、汽机组的同志感到很不好意思，好像对不起锅炉组似的。宋伟仁也在心里为难，害怕影响同志们的情绪。可是，阿布拉莫夫专家斩钉截铁地说：“要坚决返工，还要赶快返工！”宋伟仁立刻明白了：这不是谁对不对得起谁的问题，也不是照顾同志情绪的问题。为了整体利益，在组长陈先璋领导下，锅炉组很快返工了。大家不但没影响情绪，还受到一次很深刻的教育：“锅炉是个好锅炉，整个机车不好用，能说这是台好机车吗？”
    “1—5—1”新型货运机车的基本施工图已经在三月十五日设计好了，比预定计划提前三个半月。它比国内现有机车都要好。光跟冖丂1比一比吧：它所用的金属材料（在单位轮周马力上）比冖丂1要少28％，每万吨公里耗煤量要少42％，可是它的牵引力（在千分之六的坡道，速度为二十公里／小时的时候）要大41％。现在，设计科有许多人已经下到车间，配合全厂工人准备试制成功第一台新机车，作为今年国庆节的献礼。大家都为新机车的设计成功感到欢喜，特别是大家感到自己在设计过程中，不光在业务上，而且在思想上都提高了。
