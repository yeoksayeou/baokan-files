The reconstruction project of the Baoji-Tianshui section of the Longhai Railway has fully commenced since May.

The 114-kilometer Baoji to Tianshui section of the Baoji-Lanzhou line has very poor rock quality and rudimentary construction. Although it has been repaired for years since liberation, it can only maintain the passage of passenger and freight trains, and the transportation capacity is far from meeting the needs of economic construction. The Ministry of Railways has decided to spend a year and a half to reconstruct this section of the line, starting this year, so that it can safely run large locomotives and double its transportation capacity. Then, it will be gradually rebuilt into an electrified railway.

Xinhua News Agency reports that surveying of the Lanzhou to Liujiaxia railway began on the 25th.

The construction of this railway is to create transportation conditions for the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station project. This railway line is adjacent to mountains and rivers, and preliminary calculations show that it is more than 60 kilometers long.

    宝鸡—天水线改建工程动工
    兰州到刘家峡的铁路线开始勘测
    陇海铁路宝鸡至天水段线路的改建工程，五月份以来已经全面动工。
    宝（鸡）兰（州）线上的宝鸡到天水114公里的线路，石质很坏，工程简陋；解放以后虽经连年修补，只能维持客、货列车通行，运输能力远不能适应经济建设的需要，铁道部决定从今年起，争取用一年半的时间，把这段线路改建好，使它能够安全行驶大型机车，并且使运输能力比现在提高一倍。然后，再逐步改建成一条电气化铁路。

    兰州到刘家峡的铁路在二十五日开始勘测。
    修建这条铁路是给刘家峡水电站工程创造运输条件。这条铁路线，面山靠河，初步计算有六十多公里长。
