    Romania and Albania Launch Agricultural Cooperativization Movements
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 11th - Bucharest Dispatch: Currently, there are over eight thousand collective farms and joint cultivation societies in Romania, compared to just over six thousand three hundred in December of last year.
    The agricultural cooperativization movement has been developing very rapidly this year. By early March, more than one thousand five hundred new collective farms and joint cultivation societies had been established nationwide. This number is greater than the total number established throughout 1955. Some rural areas are now entirely cooperativized.
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 11th - Tirana Dispatch: More than a quarter of the villages in Albania have established agricultural production cooperatives. As the spring plowing season began this year, residents of six hundred and eighty villages across the country engaged in collective labor, approximately four times the number during the spring plowing season last year.
    Agricultural production cooperatives have received strong support from machine tractor stations during this year's spring plowing. The horsepower of tractors at machine tractor stations has increased by 73% compared to the beginning of last year. Cooperative members are particularly enthusiastic about production this year. They have used superior crop varieties from the Soviet Union and other People's Democracies, and have adopted agricultural techniques to increase yields per unit area, in order to strive to achieve the national target of increasing the country's total grain output by 64% compared to last year.

    罗阿两国开展农业合作化运动
    新华社布拉格11日电　布加勒斯特消息：目前罗马尼亚全国已经有八千多个集体农庄和联合耕种社，而去年十二月份的时候只有六千三百多个。
    今年各地的农业合作化运动发展得十分迅速。到三月初，全国就成立了一千五百多个新的集体农庄和联合耕种社。这个数目比1955年全年成立的总数还要多。有些农村目前已经全部合作化了。
    新华社布拉格11日电　地拉那消息：阿尔巴尼亚已经有四分之一以上的村庄建立了农业生产合作社。在进入今年春耕的时候，全国有六百八十个村庄的居民进行集体劳动，约相当于去年春耕时的四倍。
    农业生产合作社在今年春耕中得到机器拖拉机站的大力帮助。现在机器拖拉机站的拖拉机的马力比去年年初增加了73％。社员们今年的生产热情特别高，他们使用了苏联和其他人民民主国家的优良农作物品种，并且采用了提高单位面积产量的农业技术措施，以便争取达到国家规定的把今年全国谷物产量比去年提高64％的总指标。
