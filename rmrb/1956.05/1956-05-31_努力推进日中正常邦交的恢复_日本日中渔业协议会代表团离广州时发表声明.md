Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 29th: In a written statement issued upon leaving Guangzhou on the 28th, the Japanese delegation of the Japan-China Fisheries Council stated that after returning to Japan, the delegation would urge the Japanese government to re-recognize the importance of Japan-China friendship and amity for the realization of world peace, in order to promote the restoration of normal diplomatic relations between the two countries.

The delegation, led by head Yamazaki Kininosuke, arrived in Guangzhou on the 27th from Hangzhou after visiting Northeast China and East China. In a statement issued upon leaving Guangzhou, the delegation said: Japanese fishermen have been very fortunate in the achievements of the Japan-China private fisheries agreement over the past year. During this visit to China, we learned that Chinese fishermen are also very happy about the signing of the agreement, which makes us feel sincerely joyful. The Japan-China private fisheries agreement will be extended for another year from June 13th, and we are willing to abide by all the provisions of the agreement to spend this new year.

The statement, in discussing the delegation's impressions of its visit to China, said: After concluding the negotiations in Beijing, we had the opportunity to visit various parts of China for two weeks. Although we only saw a very small part of great China, we believe that extrapolating from these to the rest of China would not be a major error. We have seen that China is currently engaged in construction conscientiously, and the achievements of this construction are very remarkable. The full support of the Chinese people for this great construction truly impresses us greatly.

The statement concluded: We cannot forget the friendship bestowed upon us by friends from all sectors in China during our travels, and the new friends we have made through this trip. As true neighbors and brothers, we Japanese people have a deep affection for the Chinese people. Having 600 million people as our friends is a great source of pride for us! The statement emphasized that Japan's friendship and amity with China is the path towards realizing world peace. The delegation will urge the Japanese government to re-recognize this in order to promote the restoration of normal diplomatic relations between Japan and China.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, May 29th: Yamazaki Kininosuke, head of the Japanese delegation of the Japan-China Fisheries Council, said in Hong Kong on the 28th that he hoped that the China-Japan fisheries agreement would soon be handled at the government level.

    日本日中渔业协议会代表团离广州时发表声明
    新华社广州29日电　日本日中渔业协议会代表团在二十八日离开广州时发表的书面声明中，表示代表团回国后要促使日本政府重新认识日中友好和亲善对实现世界和平的重要意义，以推进日中两国正常邦交的恢复。
    由山崎喜之助团长率领的这个代表团是在到东北和华东各地进行参观后，在二十七日从杭州到达广州的。代表团在离开广州时发表声明说：日本渔民一年来十分庆幸日中民间渔业协定的成就。这次来到中国，知道中国渔民也十分高兴协定的签订，使我们感到衷心的喜悦。日中民间渔业协定从六月十三日起将延长一年，我们愿意遵守一切协议规定来度过这新的一年。
    声明在谈到代表团的访华观感说：我们结束了在北京的谈判之后，得到了参观中国各地两个星期的机会，虽然我们看到的只是伟大中国的极小的一部分，但是我们相信从这些来推察中国其余的大部分也是不会有大的错误的。我们看到：目前中国在兢兢业业地进行着建设，建设成就是非常可观的。中国人民对这一伟大建设的全力支持，确实使我们非常钦佩。
    声明最后说：我们不能忘记中国各方面的朋友们在我们的旅行中所赐予的友谊，和我们通过这次旅行所交识的新的朋友。作为真正的邻人和弟兄，我们日本人民对于中国人民是有着亲切的感情的。我们有六亿人民作为我们的朋友，是我们莫大的骄傲！声明强调，日本同中国友好和亲善是通向实现世界和平的大道。代表团要促使日本政府对此加以重新认识，以推进日中两国正常邦交的恢复。
    据新华社香港29日电　日本日中渔业协议会代表团团长山崎喜之助二十八日在香港表示，希望不久以后将由政府一级处理中日渔业协定。
