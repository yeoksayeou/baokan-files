    The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Forest Survey Team has begun its work this year to investigate suitable forest land in various parts of Northern and Southern Xinjiang. Some members of the survey team have already departed for Yanqi, Korla, Aksu and other places to conduct investigations of suitable forest land; another group of personnel will also depart for Hotan and other places before the end of May to carry out their work. Based on the results of the investigation, they will design two national shelterbelts, each 750 kilometers long and 2 kilometers wide.
    The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Water Conservancy Survey and Design Institute, which was established in early May, has formally commenced operations. The Water Conservancy Survey and Design Institute has six water conservancy survey and design teams, one geological drilling team, one hydroelectric power survey team, and hydraulic engineering and soil engineering laboratories. The institute has been equipped with more than one hundred water conservancy cadres. Currently, the six water conservancy survey and design teams have departed for Urumqi, Turpan, Hami, Yanqi, Kaidu River and other places to carry out river basin planning. They also plan to strive to overfulfill this year's water conservancy survey and design work in the Aksu River and Tacheng areas, as well as the general survey of water conservancy in Northern and Southern Xinjiang.

    新疆营林调查队调查宜林地
    水利勘测设计院开展工作
    新疆维吾尔自治区营林调查队今年在南北疆各地进行宜林调查的工作已经开始。调查队的一部分人员已出发到焉耆、库尔勒、阿克苏等地进行宜林地调查；还有一部分人员也将在五月下旬以前陆续出发到和阗等地进行工作。他们根据调查结果将设计出两条共长七百五十公里、宽二公里的国家防护林带。
    新疆维吾尔自治区水利勘测设计院在五月初宣告成立后，已经正式开展工作。这个水利勘测设计院共拥有六个水利勘测设计队和一个地质钻探队，一个水利发电查勘队和水工、土工等试验室。全院已经配备水利干部一百多人。目前，六个水利勘测设计队已经出发到乌鲁木齐、吐鲁番、哈密和焉耆、开都河等地进行流域规划。他们还计划要争取超额完成今年在阿克苏河和塔城等地的水利勘测设计和南北疆水利普查工作。
