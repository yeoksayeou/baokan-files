On Newly Reclaimed Land
    Lü Jianzhong

    I

    One evening, we went to the No. 1 Branch of the Friendship Farm, a state-owned farm in Heilongjiang Province, to see the spring wheat being sown.

    The weather was very bad. The humid wind, carrying the smell of freshly ploughed earth, rushed into the car window. The clouds were getting lower and lower, threatening an unwelcome snow and rain.

    For the Friendship Farm, a heavy snowstorm at the end of March was already not a good sign. It delayed the farm’s plan to start sowing wheat on April 3rd again and again. By April 8th, the soil had only thawed to a depth of 3 to 5 centimeters. People were anxiously waiting for the weather to improve.

    Under these circumstances, except for the No. 5 Branch, which had a higher terrain and had sown some wheat, the sowing work of the No. 1 Branch was two days ahead of the other three branches with the same conditions.

    This year, the Friendship Farm will sow wheat on 15,600 hectares of newly reclaimed, fertile land for the first time, with a planned average yield of 2,866 jin per hectare, striving to reach 3,066 jin. In order to achieve this production increase plan, the farm leaders know that, in addition to improving the quality of wheat sowing, preparing the land well, ensuring uniform sowing depth, and guaranteeing a sufficient number of plants—5 million to 5.3 million plants per hectare—the most important thing is to seize the time and sow in a timely manner.

    In the days before our visit to the sowing, the No. 1 Branch did an excellent job in order to strive for early sowing. Although the changeable spring weather brought trouble to the sowing, after several days of in-depth field investigation and trial sowing, they found that the thawing conditions of the land in different work areas and different land numbers did not fully comply with the original plan. Therefore, it was decided to appropriately change the plan according to the actual situation: wherever the land thawed first, sowing would be carried out first. They also found that the progress of sowing was affected due to some seemingly unimportant machinery preparation work not being done well—for example, screws not being tightened, furrow markers not working. The lack of tight organization and allocation of manpower resulted in a waste of much time that could have been used. During the trial sowing, the leaders of the No. 1 Branch also discovered the advanced deeds of the No. 36 Dete 54 locomotive team led by Wang Chenglin and Guan Changgeng. On the first day of operation, this team sowed 54 hectares of wheat in nine and a half hours, not only breaking the shift quota, but also meeting the standards in terms of quality, and saving nine kilograms of gasoline. Why were they able to improve their work efficiency? First, they worked in two shifts, taking turns, without stopping during meal times. Second, they flexibly used speed while the locomotive was moving. Third, they equipped appropriate manpower at the end of the field to avoid stopping when the locomotive turned around to add seeds. In this way, they only needed 42 minutes for one round trip on the 2,100-meter-long land, while the No. 41 locomotive, which was working at the same time as them, needed 48 minutes for one round trip.

    Based on these findings, the No. 1 Branch made a plan to improve the sowing work at the field affairs meeting on the evening of April 9th. At the meeting, the agricultural technical consultant of this branch, Baoluqin Ke (transliteration), suggested that "every locomotive should make full use of its time."

    We arrived at the area sown by the No. 36 team led by Wang Chenglin. The weather forecast the night before predicted the arrival of wind and snow, and the next morning their locomotive went to the field at 6:30, earlier than the usual 9 o'clock. They proudly stuck the red flag, personally sent by the Party branch secretary of the branch, on the locomotive, and galloped back and forth on that vast land non-stop. Although the wind was getting stronger and stronger, it could not cover up the majestic roar of the "iron ox."

    The No. 1 Branch has a wheat sowing task of 2,000 hectares this year, and more than 270 hectares were sown on this day.

    II

    The snow finally fell, with large snowflakes falling from dusk until dawn.

    The leaders of the general farm returned to the farm headquarters one after another, and the branch chiefs and production team leaders also rushed to attend the emergency production meeting early in the morning.

    The small meeting room was crowded with people, and the air was obviously tense. This snowfall had disrupted the plans of each branch. People cursed the weather, exchanging helpless glances with each other.

    "We just started trial sowing yesterday afternoon, and now it's over."

    "Our land can't even be harrowed."

    "Who can guarantee that it won't snow again? It would be good if we could sow the wheat by the end of April."

    The meeting began. Wang Caoli, the head of the Friendship Farm, announced that each branch should briefly talk about the progress and problems of the sowing work, and at the same time propose their own solutions.

    "This year's snow is much heavier than in previous years," said the head of the No. 4 Branch, who had run the farm for many years. "Our land is simply impossible to sow. Otherwise, we would have finished it in four days and four nights. Now, it is bound to take longer."

    "We had already sown 498 hectares before the snow, but the supply of seeds is a big problem. We had to stop the sowing of the No. 10 Production Team and draw tractors to transport seeds." The head of the No. 5 Branch was also clearly impatient.

    The No. 3 Branch had held a field affairs meeting the night before to discuss the sowing and examine the problems in the work. They were restricted by the plan and had to let all kinds of harrows lie there, while the sowing work in the forage rotation area of the No. 6 Production Team was delayed by two days because the harrowing could not keep up.

    "We did not make full use of time and machinery," the head of the No. 3 Branch, whose eyelids were slightly swollen from fatigue, said in his self-criticism. But he did not suppress his anxious mood. "We will first make a breakthrough in the sowing of the No. 6 Production Team, where it is dry, we will sow there first. We are also preparing to sow at night, and the workers have installed lights on the locomotives."

    At this time, people began to argue.

    "If the quality can be guaranteed, try to work at night as much as possible, but the quota should be lower."

    "It is best to postpone the locomotive maintenance time until after sowing, and first make a breakthrough in sowing."

    "To ensure quality, the time is bound to be delayed."

    "Precisely because it is late, we must improve the quality to make up for it."...

    Despite the different opinions, the focus of the debate was on quality and time. In some people's view, the problem seemed to be this: if quality is emphasized, time will be lost; if time is to be gained, quality will inevitably be affected.

    The meeting place sometimes rippled with whispers, and sometimes fell into tense silence.

    "Comrades, we loudly shouted quality, quality, quality in the previous stage; a snowstorm, and then it's rush sowing, rush sowing, rush sowing, regardless of quality, this is a mistake." Deputy Farm Manager and Chief Agricultural Technician Wang Zhenglin spoke. "Let's first do some calculations: we have 49 locomotives participating in sowing in the whole farm, each locomotive working for 10 hours a day, the quota is 40 hectares, then 49 locomotives will sow nearly 2,000 hectares a day, how long will it take us to sow 15,600 hectares of wheat? Moreover, the facts of some production teams have proved that we can completely break the quota, and we have the conditions to strive to complete the wheat sowing task in April in a timely and high-quality manner. The question is whether we have prepared everything, organized everything, and made full use of the time. But we obviously have not fully achieved this. ..."

    Finally, Agricultural Technical Consultant Kluchkov spoke. This experienced and energetic old expert, as usual, took off his glasses, stood up, pondered slightly, and then spoke:

    "Our task is to obtain high yields." He gestured with his hands. "To ensure yield, the first is to talk about quality, the second is to talk about sowing time; and time will also affect quality."

    "The current climatic conditions are very bad, which has caused us many difficulties, but why panic? Panic is very dangerous. I can give an example: The climate in Siberia in 1954 was also like this, with snow and rain. So someone suggested removing the furrow openers of the sowing machine and letting the seeds leak directly from the seed delivery pipe. But experienced people did not do this. They prepared everything and quickly sowed when the weather was good, and as a result, they achieved victory. It can be seen that victory belongs to those who do not panic."

    A burst of relaxed laughter rippled through the meeting place; people felt a kind of strength, a kind of confidence.

    "Should we sow at night?" Kluchkov continued. "Unless it is absolutely necessary, night sowing is not necessary, because it will affect the quality."

    "Make full use of the machinery, and do not let go of the good weather during the day. Yesterday was good weather. The No. 2 and No. 3 Branches did not sow, but the No. 1 Branch sowed, and sowed well. In order to achieve good quality and high quantity, we must learn from advanced producers and from the Wang Chenglin team of the No. 1 Branch."

    III

    People returned to their respective work posts with confidence.

    "Improve quality, seize the time!" has become a battle slogan for the whole farm.

    In the mobile camp car of the No. 1 Branch, the workers were discussing how to further break the quota.

    After returning, Dong Limin, the head of the No. 3 Branch, immediately convened a meeting to arrange the work nervously. They transferred the locomotives that the No. 5 Production Team did not need for the time being to support the No. 6 Production Team. On the office side, in a row of red dormitories, a dozen locomotive teams were enthusiastically discussing the instructions of the Party Committee on carrying out the high-quality wheat sowing campaign. They enriched the revised operation plan and competition conditions with more specific content. They want to use the achievement of an average wheat yield of 4,000 jin per hectare in the entire production team to win the honor of a high-yield team. On the first day of sowing, the No. 63 Dete 54 chartered locomotive team led by Li Youzhang of the No. 6 Production Team created a high record of sowing 65.97 hectares in twelve hours.

    In the No. 5 Branch, the workers got up at dawn to tidy up the locomotives and farm tools. They leaned over to listen to the sound of the locomotive starting, and checked every small component. Someone in the No. 10 Production Team suggested sowing without mixing the seeds, which was immediately opposed: "We cannot gain time by reducing quality!" As a result, the entire branch completed the wheat sowing work on April 23. Some Dete 54 locomotive teams sowed more than 70 hectares a day.

    Spring is spring after all. The black oily land is steaming with heat and shining with golden light under the sun. Although the northwest wind sometimes violently attacks with yellow sand, people ignore it. Harrowing the land, transporting seeds, and sowing are proceeding as usual. This black wilderness, surrounded by 200 kilometers, is immersed in the sound resembling spring thunder all day long.

    在新开垦的土地上
    吕建中
    一
    一个傍晚，我们到黑龙江国营友谊农场第一分场看播春麦。
    天气很不好。潮湿的风挟着刚被犁起的泥土的气味扑进了汽车车窗，云越来越低沉，一场不受欢迎的雨雪就要来临了。
    对于友谊农场来说，三月末的一场大风雪就已经是不大妙的了。它使场里四月三日开始播麦的计划一再拖延，到四月八日，土地仅解冻三到五公分。人们都在焦躁地等待天气的好转。
    在这种情况下，全场除了地势较高的第五分场播种了一部分小麦外，第一分场的播麦工作却比其他条件相同的三个分场提前了两天。
    今年，友谊农场全场第一次在新开垦的二万五千四百多公顷肥沃的土地上，播种一万五千六百多公顷小麦，计划每公顷平均产量2，866斤。争取达到3，066斤。为了实现这个增产计划，农场领导人员知道：除开提高小麦播种质量，把地整好，做到播种深度均匀一致，并保证有足够的株数——每公顷五百万至五百三十万株等等，最重要的是争取时间，做到适时播种。
    在我们来参观播种的头几天，第一分场为了争取及早播种，进行了出色的工作。气候多变的春天，虽然给播种带来了麻烦，但是经过几天深入田间考察和进行试播，他们发现：不同的作业区、不同地号的土地解冻情况，并不完全符合原计划所规定的作业顺序。因此决定根据实际情况适当地改变计划，哪片土地先解冻，就先在哪片土地上播种。他们还发现：由于某些看来并不紧要的机具准备工作没有做好——例如螺丝钉不紧，划印器不灵，结果影响了播种进度；由于人力的组织和调配不够严密，结果使许多可以利用的时间白白浪费。在试播的时候，第一分场的领导人员还发现了王成林和关长庚所领导的三十六号德特54机车组的先进事实。这个机组第一天作业就在九个半小时内播种了五十四公顷小麦，不仅突破了班次定额，质量也完全符合标准，并且节省了九公斤汽油。他们为什么能够提高作业效率呢？第一，分两班轮流作业，吃饭时间不停车。第二，在机车行走当中灵活运用速度。第三，地头上配备适当的人力，在机车转弯上种子的时候不停车。这样，他们在二千一百多公尺长的土地上，一个往复只需四十二分钟；而和他们同时作业的四十一号机车一个往复却要四十八分钟。
    根据这些情况，第一分场在四月九日晚上的场务会议上，做了改进播种工作的计划。会上，这个分场的农业技术顾问包罗琴科提出了“每台机车都要充分利用时间”的建议。
    我们来到王成林所领导的三十六号机组播种的地段了。头一天晚上气象台预报了风雪即将来临的消息，第二天早晨他们的机车下地时间就由九点钟提前到六点半钟了。他们骄傲地把分场党总支书记亲自送来的红旗插在机车上，一刻不停地在那辽阔的土地上往来驰骋，风尽管越来越大，但是无论如何也掩盖不住那“铁牛”的雄壮的吼声。
    第一分场今年有二千公顷的麦播任务，这一天播种了二百七十多公顷。
    二
    雪终于下起来了，大片的雪花从黄昏一直下到黎明。
    总场的领导人员陆续回到了场部，各个分场场长和生产队长们也一早就赶来参加紧急生产会议。
    不大的会议室里挤满了人，空气显然紧张。这一场雪又打乱了各个分场的计划。人们咒骂着天气，互相传递着莫可奈何的眼色。
    “我们昨天下午刚试播，这下子完了。”
    “我们的地连耙都进不去。”
    “谁敢保证不再下雪，四月底能种上麦子就算是好的。”
    会议开始了。友谊农场王操犁场长宣布要各分场扼要地讲讲播种工作进行的情况和问题，同时要提出自己解决的办法来。
    “今年的雪大大超过往年，”曾经办过多年农场的第四分场场长发言了。“我们的地根本不能下种；要不我们四天四夜就干完它。这下子，势必要延长时间。”
    “我们雪前已经播下了498公顷，可是种子供应不上是个大问题，我们不得不停止第十生产队的播种，抽出拖拉机来运种子。”第五分场场长也显然有些急躁。
    第三分场头一天晚上为了播种这件事开过一次场务会，检查了工作中存在的问题。他们被计划束缚住了手脚，只好让各式各样的耙躺在那里，而第六生产队饲草轮作区的播种工作由于耙地跟不上延迟了两天。
    “我们没有充分利用时间和机器，”那个劳碌得眼皮微肿的第三分场场长检讨说。可是他并没有抑制住自己的焦急的心情。“我们先突击第六生产队的播种，那里干了先播那里。我们也准备夜间播种，工人们把机车灯装置好了。”
    这时，人们争论起来。
    “如果能保证质量，就尽量在夜间作业，只是定额要低些。”
    “最好把机车保养时间推到播种以后，先突击播种。”
    “要保证质量，时间势必要推迟。”
    “正因为迟了，就更要提高质量来弥补。”……
    尽管各有各的不同见解，但是争论的焦点都集中在质量和时间上。在有些人看来，问题仿佛是这样：如果是强调质量，就会失去时间；如果要争取时间，就势必影响质量。
    会场上有时荡起低语声，有时又陷入紧张的沉默。
    “同志们，我们前一段响亮地喊着质量、质量、质量；一场风雪，又是抢种、抢种、抢种，不顾质量了，这是错误。”副场长兼农业总技师王正林发言了。“我们先来算一算账吧：我们全场有四十九台机车参加播种，每台机车每天按十小时作业，定额是四十公顷‘那么四十九台机车一天就播种近两千公顷，我们播种一万五千六百公顷小麦需要多长时间呢？何况有的生产队的事实已经证明，我们完全可以突破定额，完全有条件争取在四月份以内适时地、质量良好地完成播麦任务。问题就在于我们是不是把一切都准备好了，组织好了，是不是充分利用了时间。可是我们显然还没有完全做到这一点。……”
    最后，农业总技师顾问克鲁其科夫发言了。这位经验丰富、精力充沛的老专家像平日发言一样，摘下眼镜，站起来，略微思索一下，然后就讲下去：
    “我们的任务是获得高额产量。”他用手比划着。“要保证产量，第一是讲质量，第二是讲播种时间；而时间也会影响到质量的。”
    “现在的气候条件很不好，给我们造成许多困难，但是为什么要惊惶失措呢？惊惶失措是很危险的。可以举个例子：西伯利亚1954年的气候也是这样，有雪有雨。于是有人提意见把播种机的开沟器摘掉，让种子从输种管直接漏下来。可是有经验的人没有这样做，他们把一切都准备好，等天好了很快就播下去，结果获得胜利。可见胜利是属于不惊惶失措的人。”
    会场上荡起一阵舒展的笑声；人们感受到一种力量，一种信心。
    “要不要夜间播种呢？”克鲁其科夫继续说。“除非在万不得已的情况下，夜间播种是不必要的，因为那会影响质量。”
    “要充分利用机器，不要放过白天的好天气。昨天是好天气，二、三分场没有播种，一分场却播种了，播得又好。为了做到质量好、数量高，我们要向先进生产者学习，向第一分场王成林机组学习。”
    三
    人们满怀信心地回到了各自的工作岗位。
    “提高质量，争取时间！”成为全场的一种战斗口号了。
    在第一分场的野地宿营车上，工人们在讨论着如何进一步突破定额。
    第三分场场长董立民回去以后，马上就召集会议紧张地安排工作。他们把第五生产队暂时用不着的机车调来支援第六生产队。在办公室那边，一排红色的宿舍里，十几个机组在热烈地讨论着党委会关于开展麦播优良质量运动的指示，他们用更加具体的内容充实了经过修订的作业计划和竞赛条件，他们要用全生产队平均每公顷产小麦四千斤的成绩来争取丰产队的荣誉。在播种的第一天，第六生产队李有章领导的六十三号德特54包车组就创造了十二小时播种65.97公顷的高额纪录。
    在第五分场，工人们黎明时分就起来整理机车和农具，他们倾斜着身子试听机车发动的声音，检查着每个细小的机件。第十生产队有人提出不拌种子就下种，立刻遭到了反对：“不能用降低质量来争取时间！”结果，全分场在四月二十三日就完成了麦播工作。有的德特54机车组一天播种达到七十公顷以上。
    春天毕竟是春天，黑油油的土地，在阳光底下冒着热气，闪耀着金光。虽然西北风有时卷着黄沙猛烈地袭来，但是人们不理会它，耙地、运种子，播种工作在照常进行。这片周围二百公里的黑色原野，整日沉浸在恍若春雷的声响里。（附图片）
