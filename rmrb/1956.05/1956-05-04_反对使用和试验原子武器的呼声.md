　　Calls to Oppose the Use and Testing of Atomic Weapons
　　The Country that First Uses Atomic Weapons is the Enemy of Mankind
　　A Proposal from the Japanese Red Cross to International and National Red Cross Organizations
　　Xinhua News Agency, 3rd Dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese Red Cross has requested that it be declared that "regardless of the reason, the country that first uses atomic weapons is the enemy of mankind."
　　The Japanese Red Cross sent this proposal on May 2nd to the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Cross organizations of seventy-four countries.
　　Prior to this, the International Committee of the Red Cross, based on the resolution of the 23rd Board of Governors meeting of the League of Red Cross Societies regarding the prohibition of atomic weapons and the prevention of disasters from atomic weapon testing, drafted a convention on protecting civilians from the dangers of wars of mass slaughter. This draft convention will be reviewed by the 19th session of the International Red Cross Conference to be held in New Delhi next year. According to Kyodo News, the Japanese Red Cross is dissatisfied that this draft avoids mentioning the prohibition of atomic weapons and the international control of atomic weapons, and therefore put forward the above proposal as an amendment to the draft.

　　Statement by the Science Council of Japan:
　　Atomic Energy Should Only be Used for Peaceful Purposes
　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo Dispatch: The Science Council of Japan passed a statement on April 28th, calling on scientists around the world to further cooperate and promote the early conclusion of international agreements stipulating that atomic energy should only be used for peaceful purposes.
　　In the statement adopted at the close of its three-day meeting, the Science Council of Japan reiterated its statement issued two years ago on the prohibition of atomic weapons, and reaffirmed the need to ban the testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs.

　　Australian Labor Party Leader Evatt said:
　　This Issue Should be Raised at a World Conference
　　Xinhua News Agency, 3rd Dispatch from Sydney: Australian Labor Party leader Evatt said in Canberra last week: "Australia must make it clear that it opposes atomic bomb tests." He said: "We believe that the Australian people's call to stop nuclear explosions should be raised at a world conference." He said, "If major countries insist on continuing experimental explosions indefinitely, humanity will tacitly agree that one day someone will really do it."
　　The Australian opposition leader pointed out, "Recent opinion polls show that the vast majority of Australians oppose the upcoming nuclear weapons tests at Montebello, off the coast of Western Australia. In recent months, people have become increasingly aware of the serious consequences that may arise from these re-conducted tests within and around the Australian continent." British Labour MPs concerned about the issue of banning hydrogen bomb tests

　　Xinhua News Agency, 3rd Dispatch from TASS, London: At the meeting of the British House of Commons on May 1st, Labor MP Henderson asked Prime Minister Eden whether he would make a statement on the visit of Bulganin and Khrushchev to Britain. Eden replied that a very full statement had already been issued at the end of the talks and he did not think it necessary to add anything to it now. Eden said that we had long and substantive talks and we all wanted valuable results from this meeting.
　　Henderson said that the Labor Party agreed that the Soviet leaders' visit promoted better mutual understanding and closer cooperation between the two countries, and was thus conducive to universal peace.
　　Labor MP Emrys Hughes asked whether the issue of banning nuclear weapons tests and the call to ban such tests had been discussed. Other MPs also raised a series of questions related to disarmament negotiations with the Prime Minister. Eden replied that the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee was continuing its work. He said that, in view of the recently concluded talks with the Soviet leaders, it was now possible to discuss disarmament issues with the other members of the subcommittee and to see if there might be new approaches.

　　Eisenhower Rejects Stopping Nuclear Weapons Tests Despite Opposition from People Worldwide
　　Xinhua News Agency, 3rd Dispatch from Tokyo: US President Eisenhower wrote to the residents of Hiroshima, stating that the United States refused to stop nuclear weapons tests in the Western Pacific. Eisenhower described these nuclear weapons tests, which were strongly opposed by the Japanese people and the people of the world, as "absolutely necessary" "from the point of view of self-defense and the interests of the free world."
　　The Hiroshima Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs received Eisenhower's letter on May 2nd. The council had written to the heads of state of the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom on March 1st (the second anniversary of the incident in which Japanese fishermen were killed in a hydrogen bomb test conducted by the United States on Bikini Atoll), requesting a ban on all atomic weapons. Eisenhower's letter was a response to this request.

　　反对使用和试验原子武器的呼声
    今后首先使用原子武器的国家是人类的公敌
    日本红十字会向国际和各国红十字组织提出的建议
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：日本红十字会要求宣布，“不问其理由如何，今后首先使用原子武器的国家是人类的公敌”。
    日本红十字会已经在五月二日把它的这个建议寄给红十字国际委员会和七十四个国家的红十字组织。
    在此以前，由红十字国际委员会根据红十字会协会第二十三届理事会会议关于禁止原子武器和防止原子武器试验灾害的决议，起草了一项关于保护平民免于大规模屠杀的战争危险的公约的草案，这个公约草案将由明年在新德里举行的国际红十字大会第十九届会议审议。据共同社报道，日本红十字会不满意这个草案中避免提到禁止原子武器和对原子武器进行国际管制，因而提出了上述建议作为对这个草案的修正。
    日本学术会议的声明说：
    只准把原子能用于和平目的
    新华社讯　东京消息：日本学术会议在四月二十八日通过了一项声明，呼吁全世界的科学家进一步努力合作，促使早日缔结规定只准把原子能用于和平目的的国际协定。
    日本学术会议在它为时三天的会议闭幕时通过的这项声明中，重申它两年前发表的关于禁止原子武器的声明，并且再次肯定有必要禁止试验原子弹和氢弹。
    澳大利亚工党领袖伊瓦特说：
    应当向世界性会议提出这个问题
    据新华社3日讯　悉尼消息：澳大利亚工党领袖伊瓦特上星期在堪培拉发表谈话说：“澳大利亚必须说明它反对原子弹试验。”他说：“我们认为澳大利亚人民的主张停止核子爆炸的呼声应当在世界性的会议上提出来。”他说：“如果主要的国家坚持无止境地继续进行试验性的爆炸的话，人类将会默认总有一天有人真要干这种事了。”
    这位澳大利亚反对党的领袖指出，“最近刚进行的民意调查表明：绝大多数澳大利亚人反对即将在澳大利亚西海岸附近的蒙特比洛举行的核子武器试验。在最近几个月，人民越来越了解到在澳大利亚大陆内部和周围重新进行的这种试验可能产生的严重后果。”英工党议员关怀禁止氢弹试验问题
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：在英国下院五月一日的会议上，工党议员汉德逊询问首相艾登，他是否要就布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访问英国一事发表声明。艾登答复说，十分充分的声明已经在会谈结束的时候发表过了，他不认为现在还有必要再对它作什么补充。艾登说，我们进行了长时间的切实的会谈，我们大家都愿意从这次会谈中得到有价值的结果。
    汉德逊说，工党同意这样的意见：苏联领导人的访问促使两国更好地相互谅解和更紧密地合作，因而有利于普遍和平。
    工党议员埃姆里斯·休斯询问是否讨论过禁止核子武器试验问题和号召禁止这种试验。其他议员们还向首相提出了一系列同裁军谈判有关的问题。艾登回答说，联合国裁军小组委员会在继续进行工作。他说，估计到刚刚结束的同苏联领导人的会谈，现在有可能同小组委员会其他委员们商谈裁军问题，并且看一看是否可能有新的途径。
    艾森豪威尔不顾世界人民的反对拒绝停止核子武器试验
    新华社3日讯　东京消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔写信向广岛居民表示，美国拒绝停止在西太平洋进行核子武器试验。艾森豪威尔把这种遭到日本人民和世界人民强烈反对的核子武器试验说成是“从自卫和自由世界的利益看来”，“是绝对必要的”。
    广岛禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会是五月二日接到艾森豪威尔这封信的。协议会曾经在三月一日（美国在比基尼岛进行氢弹试验杀害日本渔民事件两周年）写信给美国、苏联、英国首脑，要求禁止一切原子武器。艾森豪威尔的信就是对这个要求的答复。
