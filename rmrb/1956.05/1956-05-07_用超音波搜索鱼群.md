Xinhua News Agency report:

    Using Ultrasound to Search for Fish Schools
    The No. 1 team of the state-owned Shanghai Aquatic Products Company returned fully loaded on the evening of the 4th with fishing vessels equipped with ultrasonic fish finders. In the first three days of May, they caught more than 570,000 jin of small yellow croaker.
    This latest equipment for searching for fish schools—the ultrasonic fish finder—is placed in the wheelhouse of the fishing vessel like an ordinary radio. When searching for fish schools, this fish finder emits ultrasonic waves sixty or one hundred and twenty times per minute. The ultrasonic waves radiate towards the bottom of the water at a speed of 1,500 meters per second. When encountering fish schools, the indicator needle of the machine's automatic recorder leaves various special dark brown symbols on the recording paper. From the shape, density, and position of the symbols, one can judge the quantity of the fish school, the type of fish, and their distance from the surface of the water.

    用超音波搜索鱼群
    国营上海水产公司一队装有超音波鱼群探测器的渔轮，四日晚上满载而归。他们在五月份头三天中，捕获的小黄鱼就有五十七万多斤。
    这种搜索鱼群的最新设备——超音波鱼群探测器，像一架普通的收音机一样放在渔轮的驾驶室里。搜索鱼群的时候，这架鱼群探测器每分钟发出超音波六十次或一百二十次，超音波以每秒钟一千五百公尺的速度向水底放射，遇着鱼群，机器上自动纪录器的指示针就在纪录纸上留下各种特殊的深棕色符号，从符号的形态、密度和位置上，可以判断鱼群的多少、鱼的类别和它们离水面的距离。
