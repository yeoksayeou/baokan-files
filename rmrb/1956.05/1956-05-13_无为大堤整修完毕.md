    Wuwei Dike Renovation Completed
    The renovation project of the Wuwei Dike, which is 230 Chinese miles long on the north bank of the Yangtze River in Anhui Province, has been basically completed. After the completion of this renovation project, nine counties and cities along the dike will no longer be threatened by Yangtze River floods, and the bumper harvest of 4.8 million mu of land within the dike can also be guaranteed.
