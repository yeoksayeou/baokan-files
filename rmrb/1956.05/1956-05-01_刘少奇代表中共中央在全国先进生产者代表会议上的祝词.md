Comrades!

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, I extend warm congratulations to the National Conference of Advanced Producers' Representatives and to all advanced producers and advanced workers across the country, both those attending this conference and those who are not!

Since the second half of last year, a massive upsurge of agricultural cooperation has emerged in our country's rural areas, followed by the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and handicrafts throughout the country, which has also entered a high tide. This is the extremely broad and profound socialist revolution currently underway in our country. The victory of this revolution has greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the people across the country to build socialism and has promoted a surge in the entire national economy and cultural undertakings. As everyone knows, the nation's farmers are making unprecedented efforts on the agricultural production front, striving to gradually realize the great 12-year agricultural development plan for 1956-1967. Among them, a large number of agricultural labor models have emerged, uniting the broad masses of farmers and becoming the backbone of the agricultural front. Similarly, among the working class, on the industrial front and other economic and cultural fronts, and in various work departments and positions, a socialist construction upsurge of unprecedented scale has emerged, with a large number of advanced producers and advanced workers. They have launched the advanced producer movement, leading the broad masses of workers and intellectuals to strive for greater, better, faster, and more economical realization of the great socialist construction plan. You are the representatives of these outstanding elements of the working class.

The common goal of the people of our country is to build our country into a great socialist country with strong industry and agriculture and a high level of culture. Our country's current economic level and scientific, cultural, and technological level are still very backward. Therefore, we must mobilize all possible positive factors from all sides and carry out long-term, arduous struggle to gradually change our backward situation and realize our great historical task. At present, the advanced producers on various production fronts and the advanced workers in various work departments are precisely the most active factors in our country's socialist construction. This factor should receive our utmost attention.

The people are the creators of history. The history of human society is, in the final analysis, the history of production, the history of producers. Production is always in a state of development and change, with new production technologies constantly replacing old ones. Therefore, in any era and in any production department, there are always a few relatively advanced producers who adopt more advanced production technologies and create more advanced production quotas. Subsequently, more and more producers learn their techniques and reach their quotas, until finally, the production level of the original few advanced elements becomes the production level of the entire society, and social production is improved. If there is a major invention in production technology, it will cause a major reform of production technology, creating a huge surge in production. Therefore, advanced producers are the pioneers of the forward development of human economic life and also the pioneers of the forward development of human social history.

However, advanced producers were not always valued by society in the old days. On the contrary, the exploiting classes generally despised producers. Only when the creations of advanced producers were beneficial to the exploiters did they utilize such creations, but they still often restricted others from learning and utilizing such creations for the sake of "patents." And when the creations of advanced producers were detrimental to the exploiters, or when the exploiters, due to ignorance, could not understand the value of such creations, such creations and their creators were often attacked and suppressed. Therefore, in the old society, the utilization and development of the advanced experiences and various inventions and creations of advanced producers were always subject to various restrictions. Socialist society is the opposite of the old society; its masters are not exploiters but the working people themselves. In socialist society, no one is forbidden from learning and utilizing the advanced experiences of advanced producers. On the contrary, it requires advanced producers to give full play to their role, and requires other producers to earnestly learn and utilize their advanced experiences, because the interests of socialist society are consistent with the interests of advanced producers. In socialist society, there are still contradictions between the advanced and the backward, but these contradictions are not antagonistic. The basic method for socialist society to resolve these contradictions is through the conscious efforts of the working masses and through education and criticism, constantly raising the backward to the advanced level. The struggle of millions of laborers, led by advanced producers, to eliminate backwardness is a driving force for the continuous advancement of socialist society. Precisely because of this, advanced producers in our era can develop into such a powerful mass movement and occupy such a glorious position in social life. As everyone knows, Comrade Mao Zedong once said that labor models have three roles: leading role, backbone role, and bridging role. That is to say, under the conditions of the people's democratic system, advanced producers are not only the pioneers of the masses of the people, but also become the core of the masses of the people and an important link between the state and the masses of the people. Advanced producers are an indispensable part of the leadership of society and the state; without advanced producers, there can be no completely correct leadership.

Comrades! The fact that you are gathered here to hold the National Conference of Advanced Producers' Representatives, and that your conference has received great attention from the Party and the government, shows that we firmly support your creations on various production fronts and support the national advanced producer movement; it shows that we firmly stand with you and demand that the entire working class work like you; it shows that we are determined to overcome all obstacles and strive to rapidly transform the advanced production level you have already reached into the production level of the entire society, and to continue to advance to newer production levels.

In order to develop the advanced producer movement, in order to make the advanced producer movement achieve such a goal, the joint efforts of advanced producers, ordinary producers, and production leaders are needed.

Every advanced producer should adhere to their advanced production technology and advanced production quotas, and should strive to popularize their advanced technology and advanced quotas. Advanced producers should not only maintain their own advancement, but also strive to promote others from backwardness to advancement. Therefore, advanced producers must use all methods to help and teach others, and constantly strive to become more advanced. Relying solely on temporary advancement cannot maintain eternal glory, and complacency can only promote one's own regression. Only through continuous learning and continuous effort is it possible to continuously advance.

Every ordinary producer should learn from advanced producers, emulate advanced producers, and rapidly raise the general level of production to the level of advanced elements. This is entirely possible and must be done. May I ask, since it is something that advanced producers have already done, what reason do other producers with the same conditions have for not being able to do it? Since it is something that advanced units have already done, what reason do other units with the same conditions have for not being able to do it? Obviously, those who refuse to emulate advanced producers have no reason to speak of; they only have a kind of inertia of muddling along, the essence of which is none other than maintaining the backward state of production and maintaining the backward state of our country. Therefore, we must criticize those who do not actively catch up with the advanced and use various excuses to defend their backwardness; we must demand that they earnestly change this attitude. Only in this way is it possible to transform the level of advanced producers into the general level of the entire society as quickly as possible, thereby promoting the advancement of the entire society's production as quickly as possible.

Every production leader should resolutely support the advanced producer movement and support every advanced experience and creation that has practical significance. That is to say, first, he must carefully assess, study, and summarize the advanced experiences of advanced producers in order to determine that it can be promoted and should be promoted, and find effective methods for promotion. Second, he must take all necessary technical and organizational measures, such as organizing performances, imparting, and training in advanced operations, improving the original equipment, labor organization, and operating procedures, studying the economic, technical, and ideological reasons why people are unwilling to learn advanced experiences, and eliminating them, etc., in order to actually promote, rather than merely talk about promoting, the experiences of these advanced producers. The more and better he does these practical tasks, the greater his achievements will be in promoting the advanced producer movement. Admittedly, this is an arduous and meticulous task, but a person who is afraid of doing arduous and meticulous work cannot become a leader of the socialist cause.

Unfortunately, there are still such leaders in our socialist cause; these people have what we call bureaucratic tendencies. In order to develop the advanced producer movement, it is necessary to fight against this bureaucratic tendency.

There are several forms of bureaucratic tendencies that hinder the advanced producer movement. Some people are actually dissatisfied with or opposed to the advanced producer movement. They are content with being backward, treating backward technology and backward quotas as advanced things, or as things that cannot be changed, or at least cannot be changed at present. Many of our advanced producers have already fought against these people, using facts to criticize their erroneous views and educating them. We still need to continue to oppose this tendency in the future. But there is also another form of bureaucratic tendency. Those with this tendency not only do not oppose the advanced producer movement in words or even subjectively, but also enthusiastically support it, but they are satisfied with empty slogans, satisfied with general calls, satisfied with giving advanced producers award banners, writing interviews, satisfied with letting advanced producers be this or that representative, but they rarely seriously create conditions for advanced producers to continuously advance, rarely seriously study the experiences of advanced producers, and seriously promote these experiences. They do not strive to advance from individual advanced producers to entire advanced workshops, from individual advanced workshops to entire advanced factories, from individual advanced factories to entire advanced industries, but instead make advanced producers risk being busy with social activities, detached from the masses, unable to continue to improve, and gradually becoming backward producers. We must correct this bureaucratic leadership method.

Another fairly prevalent manifestation of bureaucratic tendencies is not caring about the immediate living interests of the workers and staff masses. In socialist society, the interests of the state, the interests of the collective, and the personal interests of the laborers should be consistent, without irreconcilable contradictions. Workers in state-owned enterprises, joint state-private enterprises, and cooperative enterprises, staff members in state organs and cultural, educational, and health institutions, and farmers in cooperatives, their labor is for the interests of the state and the collective, and at the same time directly for their personal interests. And the interests of the state are the common interests of the working people, and also the most fundamental interests of every working person. Of course, it is incorrect to set personal interests against the interests of the state and the collective, and to pursue the improvement of life apart from the development of production. But it is also incorrect to only pay attention to increasing production and increasing the interests of the state and the collective, without paying attention to increasing the personal interests of the laborers. It is entirely legitimate and necessary to demand that personal income be gradually increased and personal life improved on the basis of developing production. Only in this way will the enthusiasm of the laborers continue to increase, and the advanced producer movement can gain a solid foundation. But now some leaders of enterprises and institutions only unilaterally pay attention to improving labor productivity and increasing production, but do not pay attention to increasing the income of laborers and improving the personal lives of laborers as possible and necessary, and do not pay attention to giving full rewards to those who have outstanding achievements in production and work. This tendency must undoubtedly be resolutely corrected.

Only by resolutely relying on the joint efforts of advanced producers, ordinary producers, and production leaders, only by resolutely overcoming various bureaucratic tendencies in leadership work, and by correctly handling the relationship between state interests, collective interests, and personal interests, and closely combining them, can we make the advanced producer movement develop universally and persistently, and can we continuously improve our country's production level and scientific, cultural, and technological level on this basis.

Comrades! Our country is a country of the people's democratic system. In our country, all work must implement the mass line and must rely on the combination of top-down methods and bottom-up methods. Without the initiative and initiative of the masses, without the wisdom and strength of the masses, the leadership of any minority will not be correct, effective, and solid. Conversely, as long as we closely rely on the masses not only in words but also in practical actions, we will be able to overcome all difficulties. The most difficult task lies before us, which is to build a large country with a population of 600 million, which is economically and culturally backward, into an advanced socialist industrial power. Completing this task will greatly strengthen the entire socialist camp and will greatly consolidate world peace. In order to achieve this goal, you, all the representatives of advanced producers, and we, equally bear a great and glorious responsibility. We hope that each of you representatives, each advanced producer and advanced worker you represent, and each advanced element among farmers, handicraftsmen, commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, and other patriotic people, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, can closely link with the masses, lead the masses to continuously emulate the advanced level, and continuously advance and advance again. Then, we will all be able to accomplish our common historical task. Long live the victory of our motherland's great socialist construction plan! Long live the Chinese working class fighting for socialism! Long live the great Chinese people!

    刘少奇代表中共中央在全国先进生产者代表会议上的祝词
    同志们！
    我代表中国共产党中央委员会，向全国先进生产者代表会议，向出席和没有出席这次会议的全国先进生产者和先进工作者，致以热烈的祝贺！
    从去年下半年以来，在我国的农村中兴起了巨大的农业合作化的高潮，接着全国资本主义工商业和手工业的社会主义改造也进入了高潮，这就是目前我国正在进行着的极为广阔极为深刻的社会主义革命。这个革命现在已经取得了决定性的胜利。这个革命的胜利极大地鼓舞了全国人民建设社会主义的积极性，促进了整个国民经济和文化事业的高涨。大家知道，全国的农民在农业生产战线上正在进行着空前未有的努力，为逐步地实现1956—1967的12年农业发展的伟大计划而奋斗。在他们中间，出现了大批的农业劳动模范，他们团结着广大的农民群众，成为农业战线上的中坚。同样，在工人阶级中间，在工业战线以及其他经济战线和文化战线上，在各个工作部门的工作岗位上，也出现了空前规模的社会主义建设的热潮，出现了大批的先进生产者和先进工作者，他们发起了先进生产者运动，领导着广大的工人群众和知识分子群众，为又多又好又快又省地实现伟大的社会主义建设计划而斗争。你们就是工人阶级中间这些优秀分子的代表。
    我国人民的共同目的是要把我国建设成为一个伟大的、有强大的工业和农业和有高度文化的社会主义国家。我国目前的经济水平和科学、文化、技术水平还是很落后的。因此，我们必须动员各方面一切可能动员的积极因素，进行长期的艰苦的斗争，才能逐步地改变我们的落后状况，实现我们的伟大的历史任务。目前我国各个生产战线上的先进生产者，各个工作部门中的先进工作者，正是我国社会主义建设事业中的一种最积极的因素。这种因素应当受到我们最大的重视。
    人民群众是历史的创造者。人类社会的历史，归根结底，是生产的历史，是生产者的历史。生产是永远处在发展变动的状态中的，新的生产技术不断地代替着旧的生产技术。因此，在任何时代，在任何生产部门中，总是有少数比较先进的生产者，他们采用着比较先进的生产技术，创造着比较先进的生产定额。随后，就有愈来愈多的生产者学会了他们的技术，达到了他们的定额，直至最后，原来是少数先进分子的生产水平就成为全社会的生产水平，社会生产就提高了。如果有重大的生产技术的发明，就要引起生产技术的重大改革，创造生产的巨大高涨。因此，先进生产者是人类经济生活向前发展的先驱，也是人类社会历史向前发展的先驱。
    但是先进生产者在旧的时代并不是经常受到社会重视的。恰恰相反，剥削阶级一般地是贱视生产者的。当先进生产者的创造有利于剥削者的时候，剥削者才利用这种创造，但是仍然常常为着“专利”而限制别人学习和利用这种创造。而当先进生产者的创造不利于剥削者，或者剥削者由于愚昧，而不能了解这种创造的价值的时候，这种创造和创造者就常常受到打击，受到压制。因此，在旧社会中，先进生产者的先进经验和各种发明创造的利用和发展，总是受到各种限制的。社会主义社会跟过去的旧社会相反，它的主人不是剥削者，而是生产的劳动者自己。在社会主义社会里，没有人禁止学习和利用先进生产者的先进经验，相反，它要求先进生产者充分发挥自己的作用，要求其他的生产者认真地学习和利用他们的先进经验，因为社会主义社会的利益是同先进生产者的利益一致的。在社会主义社会里，仍然有先进和落后的矛盾，但是这种矛盾不是对抗性的矛盾；社会主义社会解决这种矛盾的基本方法，就是通过劳动群众的自觉的努力，通过教育和批评的方式，不断地把落后提高到先进的水平。千百万劳动者在先进生产者率领下为消除落后而斗争，就是社会主义社会不断前进的一种动力。正因为这样，先进生产者在我们的时代里才能发展成为如此强大的群众性的运动，才能在社会生活中居于如此光荣的地位。大家知道，毛泽东同志曾经说过，劳动模范有三种作用：即带头作用、骨干作用和桥梁作用。这就是说，在人民民主制度的条件下，先进生产者不但是人民群众的先驱，而且成了人民群众的核心，成了国家和人民群众之间的重要纽带。先进生产者是社会和国家的领导力量的不可缺少的组成部分；没有先进生产者，也就不可能有完全正确的领导。
    同志们！你们聚集在这里举行全国先进生产者代表会议，你们的会议受到党和政府的极大的重视，这个事实就是表示我们坚决支持你们在各个生产战线上的创造，支持全国的先进生产者运动；就是表示我们坚决同你们站在一起，要求全体工人阶级像你们一样地劳动；就是表示我们决心克服一切障碍，为把你们所已经达到的先进的生产水平迅速地变为全社会的生产水平，并且为继续前进到更新的生产水平而斗争。
    为了发展先进生产者运动，为了使先进生产者运动达到这样的目的，需要先进生产者、普通生产者和生产的领导者三方面的共同努力。
    每一个先进生产者应当坚持自己的先进的生产技术和先进的生产定额，应当为普及自己的先进的技术和先进的定额而斗争。先进生产者不只是要保持自己的先进，而且要努力促进别人由落后达到先进。因此，先进生产者必须用一切方法帮助和教会别人，并且不断地争取更加先进。仅仅依靠一时的先进不能保持永远的光荣，而骄傲自满只能促成自己的退步。唯有不断地学习，不断地努力，才有可能不断地前进。
    每一个普通生产者应当向先进生产者学习，向先进生产者看齐，迅速地把一般的生产水平提高到先进分子的水平。这是完全可以做到而且是必须做到的。试问，既然是先进生产者已经做到的事，具有同样条件的别的生产者有什么理由做不到呢？既然是先进的单位已经做到的事，具有同样条件的别的单位有什么理由做不到呢？很明显，拒绝向先进生产者看齐的人们没有什么理由可讲，有的只是一种得过且过的惰性，这种惰性的实质不是别的，就是要保持生产的落后状态，保持我们国家的落后状态。因此，我们必须批评那种不积极赶上先进者、用种种借口替自己的落后辩护的人们，我们必须要求他们切实地改变这种态度。只有如此，才有可能尽快地把先进生产者的水平变为全社会的一般水平，从而尽快地把全社会的生产推向前进。
    每一个生产的领导者应当坚决地支持先进生产者的运动，支持每一个有实际意义的先进经验和创造。这就是说，第一，他必须详细地鉴定、研究和总结先进生产者的先进经验，以便确定它是可以推广和应当推广的，并且找出推广的有效的方法。第二，他必须采取一切必要的技术措施和组织措施，例如组织先进操作的表演、传授和训练，改进原有的设备、劳动组织和操作规程，研究人们不愿意学习先进经验的经济上、技术上和思想上的原因，并且加以消除，等等，以便实际地而不是空谈地推广这种先进生产者的经验。谁做的这些实际工作愈多、愈好，他在推广先进生产者运动方面所得的成绩也就愈大。诚然，这是一个艰苦的、细致的工作，但是一个害怕做艰苦细致工作的人，是不能够成为一个社会主义事业的领导者的。
    可惜在我们的社会主义事业中，这样的一种领导者还是有的，这些人具有我们所说的官僚主义的倾向。为了发展先进生产者运动，必须跟这种官僚主义倾向作斗争。
    妨碍先进生产者运动的官僚主义倾向有几种形式。有一种人是实际上不满意或者反对先进生产者运动的。他们安于落后，把落后的技术和落后的定额当作先进的东西，或者是当作不能更改、至少是目前不能更改的东西。我们的不少的先进生产者已经跟这种人进行了斗争，用事实批判了他们的错误的观点，使他们受到了教育。我们今后还需要继续反对这种倾向。但是还有另一种形式的官僚主义倾向。有这种倾向的人，口头上甚至主观上不但不反对先进生产者运动，而且是热烈支持的，但是他们满足于空喊，满足于一般号召，满足于给先进生产者发奖旗，写访问记，满足于让先进生产者当这种或者那种代表，但是他们很少认真地为先进生产者创造条件，使之不断前进，很少认真地研究先进生产者的经验，认真地推广这些经验，他们不努力由个别的先进生产者前进到整个的先进的车间，由个别的先进的车间前进到整个的先进的工厂，由个别的先进的工厂前进到整个的先进的行业，反而使先进生产者有忙于应酬、脱离群众、不能继续提高、渐渐变为落后生产者的危险。我们必须纠正这种官僚主义的领导方法。
    官僚主义倾向还有一种相当流行的表现，就是不关心职工群众的切身生活利益。在社会主义社会中，国家的利益、集体的利益和劳动者个人的利益应当是一致的，其中没有不可调和的矛盾。国营企业、公私合营企业、合作社营企业的工人，国家机关中和文化、教育、卫生事业机关中的工作人员，合作社的农民，他们的劳动是为着国家和集体的利益，同时是直接为着他们个人的利益。而国家的利益则是劳动人民的共同利益，也是每个劳动人民最根本的利益。当然，把个人的利益跟国家和集体的利益对立起来，离开生产的发展而追求生活的改善，这种意见是不正确的。但是只注意增加生产，增加国家和集体的利益，而不注意增加劳动者个人的利益，也是不正确的。要求在发展生产的基础上逐步增加个人的收入，改善个人的生活，这是完全正当的和必要的。只有这样，劳动者的积极性才会不断提高，先进生产者运动才能获得巩固的基础。但是现在有些企业和机关的领导者只是片面地注意提高劳动生产率，增加生产，却不注意按照可能和必要增加劳动者的收入，改善劳动者个人的生活，对于在生产上、工作上有卓越成就的人们，也不注意给予充分的奖励。这种倾向，无疑是必须坚决纠正的。
    只有坚决依靠先进生产者、普通生产者和生产领导者的共同努力，只有坚决克服领导工作中的各种官僚主义倾向，并且正确地处理国家利益、集体利益和个人利益的关系，把它们紧密地结合起来，我们才能使先进生产者运动得到普遍的持久的发展，才能使我国的生产水平和科学、文化、技术水平在这一基础上不断地提高。
    同志们！我们的国家是人民民主制度的国家，在我们的国家里，一切工作都必须贯彻执行依靠群众的路线，都必须依靠由上而下的方法和由下而上的方法相结合。离开群众的积极性主动性，离开群众的智慧和力量，任何少数人的领导都不会是正确的、有效的和巩固的。反过来说，只要我们不是在口头上而是在实际行动中密切地依靠群众，我们就能够战胜一切困难。在我们的前面摆着一个最困难的任务，这就是要把一个在经济上和文化上都很落后的六亿人口的大国建设成为一个先进的社会主义工业强国。完成这个任务，就会使整个社会主义阵营极大地加强起来，就会使世界和平极大地巩固起来。为了达到这个目的，你们全体先进生产者代表和我们同样担负着巨大的、光荣的责任。我们希望你们每一位代表，你们所代表的每一位先进生产者和先进工作者，以及农民、手工业者、人民解放军的指战员和其他爱国人民中的每一位先进分子，在党中央和国务院的领导下，都能够密切地联系群众，带领群众不断地向先进的水平看齐，不断地前进再前进，那末，我们大家就一定能够完成我们共同的历史任务。我们祖国的伟大的社会主义建设计划胜利万岁！为社会主义而奋斗的中国工人阶级万岁！伟大的中国人民万岁！
