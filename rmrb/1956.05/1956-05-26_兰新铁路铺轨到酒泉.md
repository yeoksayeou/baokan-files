Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, May 25th. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway track-laying workers advancing across the Gobi Desert have already laid the rails to Jiuquan, 738 kilometers from Lanzhou, on the 24th. From here to Yumen East Station, it is only a little over 50 kilometers. The workers are driving the track-laying machine, day and night, continuing to advance towards Yumen.

Jiuquan, formerly known as Suzhou, is where the famous Jiayuguan of the Great Wall is located, about 30 kilometers outside the city. The Jiuquan area is a large basin, with snowmelt from the Qilian Mountains irrigating thousands of acres of fertile land, making it an oasis in the Gobi Desert. In the future, new cotton-growing areas will also be opened up in the basin. This basin is also one of China's major oil storage areas. After Jiuquan opens to traffic, it will better support the various geological prospecting teams active here; the new agricultural implements, chemical fertilizers, and daily necessities needed by farmers will also be transported in large quantities and quickly.

    兰新铁路铺轨到酒泉
    新华社兰州25日电　在戈壁滩上前进的兰新铁路铺轨工人，已经在二十四日把钢轨铺到了离兰州738公里的酒泉。从这里西去玉门东站，只有五十多公里。工人们正在驾驶着铺轨机，日夜不停地向玉门继续前进。
    酒泉古称肃州，著名的长城嘉峪关就在城外三十多公里的地方。酒泉一带为一大盆地，从祁连山上流下的雪水灌溉着千万亩良田，成为戈壁滩上的绿洲。今后盆地上还要开辟新的植棉区。这个盆地也是我国主要的储藏石油地区之一。酒泉通车以后，将会更好地支援活跃在这里的各种地质勘探队；农民需要的新式农具、化学肥料和日常生活用品，也将会大量迅速地运来。
