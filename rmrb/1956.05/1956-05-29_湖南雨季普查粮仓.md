With the plum rain season arriving, grain dampness, mildew, and pest infestations are continuously occurring in grain depots across Hunan Province. Grain departments at all levels throughout the province are universally launching grain survey work. Currently, the survey work in the three cities of Changsha, Hengyang, and Zhuzhou has been completed.

During the survey, the Lanxi District of Yiyang County discovered that five granaries had lost more than 500 jin of grain due to mildew. In the Fourth District of Zixing County, over one million jin of stored grain had moisture levels exceeding safety standards due to a lack of routine forecasting and inspection. Therefore, after clarifying the situation through the survey, various localities have taken emergency measures.

Through the survey, various localities have restored and improved their granary protection organizations, and discovered and dealt with unregistered granaries and unregistered grain. In the Fourth District of Zixing County, one granary had been neglected since the grain was stored last year. Only after being reported by the masses did someone finally manage it.

    湖南雨季普查粮仓
    梅雨季节到来了，湖南省各地粮仓中不断发生粮食反潮霉变和虫害蔓延，全省各级粮食部门正在普遍展开粮食普查工作。目前，长沙、衡阳、株州三市普查工作已经结束。
    在普查中，益阳县兰溪区发现有五座仓库因霉变损失粮食五百多斤，资兴县四区有一百多万斤存粮，因平日缺乏预测和检查，大部分粮食的水分超过安全标准。因此各地通过普查摸清情况后，都作了紧急处理。
    经过普查，各地都恢复、健全了护仓组织，发现和处理了黑仓黑粮。资兴县四区有一个粮仓，自去年粮食入库后，一直无人过问，这次经过群众报告，才有人去管理。
