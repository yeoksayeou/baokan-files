Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 29th. Mayor Sudiro of the Special Municipality of Jakarta, Indonesia, said on the 27th: "I have long heard about the rapid progress of the People's Republic of China. Although Chairman Mao said that this progress is merely 'the first step in a ten-thousand-li long march', according to the information I have received, this progress is already enough to shock the world." Sudiro added: "There is a Chinese saying: 'Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times', so I have come here in person to observe."

Sudiro made these remarks in his "Impressions Upon Arriving in the People's Republic of China" after arriving in Guangzhou. He said: "The People's Republic of China has invited Indonesian tour groups to Beijing many times in the past, such as cultural delegations, labor union representatives, and Prime Minister Ali's cabinet, and even President Sukarno himself is going to visit. However, my visit this time is slightly different from the visits mentioned above, because I am here this time to promote the relationship between capital and capital, city and city, or more precisely, to promote friendly relations between Jakarta and Beijing, Jakarta and Guangzhou, as well as with Shanghai, Chongqing, and other cities." He hopes that "this trip will be beneficial to the enhancement of friendship between our two great nations, especially between the people of Jakarta and Beijing and other cities."

After arriving in Guangzhou on the 27th, Sudiro visited the site of the Peasant Movement Training Institute, Huanghuagang, the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, the Ancient Tombs of the Worthies, the Guangzhou Commune Martyrs Cemetery, the Guangta Mosque, and Yuexiu Mountain. He and his wife and entourage took a plane to Beijing this morning.

    苏迪罗市长在广州时发表到达我国的感想
    新华社广州29日电　印度尼西亚雅加达特别市市长苏迪罗二十七日说：“我早已听到关于中华人民共和国的迅速的进步，虽然毛主席说这些进步仅仅是‘万里长征走完了第一步’，但是根据我所得到的情报，这种进步已经足以震惊全世界”。苏迪罗又说：“中国有句俗话：‘百闻不如一见’，所以我特地亲来观察”。
    苏迪罗是在到达广州后发表的“抵达中华人民共和国的感想”中这样说的。他说：“中华人民共和国过去已经好多次邀请印度尼西亚观光团赴北京，如文化代表团，劳工团体代表，以及阿里内阁总理等，甚至苏加诺总统自己也要来访问。可是我这次访问与上述访问稍为不同，因为我这次是为了促进首都与首都、城市与城市，更确切地说“是为了促进雅加达与北京、雅加达与广州以及与上海、重庆及其他城市之间的友好关系而来访问的”。他希望，“此行对于我们两大民族之间、尤其是雅加达和北京以及城市人民之间的友谊的增进有好处”。
    苏迪罗在二十七日到达广州后，曾到农民运动讲习所旧址、黄花岗、中山纪念堂、先贤古墓、广州公社烈士陵园、光塔寺、越秀山等地参观。他已经在今天上午和他的夫人以及随行人员等乘飞机去北京。
