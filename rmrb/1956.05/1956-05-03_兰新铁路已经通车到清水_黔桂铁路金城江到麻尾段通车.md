　　Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Open to Traffic to Qingshui
    Jinzhongjiang-Mawei Section of Guizhou-Guangxi Railway Open to Traffic

    Starting from May 1st, the operational mileage of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has been extended westward from Zhangye by 138 kilometers to Qingshui. Thus far, 677 kilometers of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway are open to traffic.

    After the opening of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway to Qingshui, petroleum products produced by the Yumen Mining Bureau will be loaded onto trains here for transportation, thereby shortening the distance of oil transportation by trucks. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and the Qingshui-Hami highway began handling truck-train combined transportation on May 1st. Transportation from the interior to Xinjiang is now much more convenient than before. (Xinhua News Agency)

    The Jinzhongjiang to Mawei (within Dushan County, Guizhou Province) section of the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway, which is under repair, officially opened to traffic on the 1st. The 203rd ordinary passenger train carrying passengers from various regions and to and from Guizhou, Yunnan, and other provinces, departed from Jinzhongjiang at 0:13 on the 1st and arrived in Mawei on time at 9:43 on the same day, as scheduled. Local ethnic groups, who had not seen trains for several years, were extremely delighted.

    The Jinma section of the railway is 153 kilometers long and construction work for its restoration began in October 1955. Rail laying and trial runs were completed ahead of schedule on March 15 this year.

    It is expected that the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway will be open to traffic to Duyun by the end of this year. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　兰新铁路已经通车到清水
    黔桂铁路金城江到麻尾段通车
    从五月一日起，兰新铁路通车营业的里程又从张掖向西延伸138公里到清水。至此，兰新铁路已经有677公里通车。
    兰新铁路通车到清水以后，玉门矿务局生产的石油制品就由这里装上火车转运出去，因而缩短了汽车运油的距离。兰新铁路和清水至哈密的公路已经在五月一日开始办理了汽车火车联运。现在内地到新疆的交通运输比以前方便多了。（新华社）
    修复中的黔桂铁路金城江到麻尾（贵州省独山县境）段，一日正式通车营业。载着来自各地和往返贵州、云南等省旅客的二百零三次普通客车，一日零点十三分从金城江开出，按照预定时间，在当日上午九点四十三分准时到达麻尾。好几年没有看到火车的当地各民族群众，欢欣万分。
    金麻段铁道全长153公里，是1955年10月开始动工修复的。今年三月十五日就提前完成铺轨试车。
    预计黔桂铁路今年年底可以通车到都匀。（据新华社讯）
