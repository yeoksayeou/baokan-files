Xinhua News Agency, May 29th -- According to a report from the British Press Association, British Labour Party left-wing leader Bevan said on May 27th: Five years ago, some people told the British people that the Soviet Union had established a superior military force and intended to attack Western countries. Now, some people are telling the British people that the Soviet Union possesses a large number of scientists and experts, and it intends to export communism along with goods and services. "Under what circumstances have these statements ever deceived the people?"

Bevan was speaking at a gathering held by the "Tribune" weekly in Newcastle. Bevan said that he himself never believed that the Soviet Union intended to attack the West. He said: "It is now becoming increasingly clear that the Soviet leaders are genuinely afraid of Western military plans and have made some preparations to repel possible attacks. However, after the war, the main direction of their country's efforts has been to rebuild their industry and train teachers, scientists, and technical experts."

Bevan believes that we should begin to realistically assess the international situation. He criticized the West for spending billions of pounds to manufacture weapons and aircraft that are of no benefit, and for rearming West Germany.

Bevan also said that Britain does not have to imitate the Soviet system. But he believes that the Soviet Union's economic and industrial achievements are the result of applying socialist principles. He said: "Now, they are able to train tens of thousands of scientists and technical experts, while we do not pay attention to our schools and universities."

    比万说：
    他从来不信苏联打算进攻西方
    对苏联的种种诽谤骗不过人民
    新华社29日讯　据英国报联社报道，英国工党左翼领袖比万五月二十七日说：五年以前，有人对英国人民说，苏联建立了优越的军事力量，打算向西方国家进攻。现在，又有人对英国人民说，苏联拥有大量的科学家和专家，它打算在输出货物和服务的同时输出共产主义。“这些说法在什么情况之下曾经骗得过人民呢？”
    比万是在“论坛”周报在纽卡斯尔举办的集会上讲话。比万说，他自己从来不相信苏联打算向西方进攻。他说：“现在越来越清楚，苏联领导人真正害怕西方的军事计划，并且为击退可能的进攻作了某种准备。但是，大战后他们的国家努力的方向主要是在改建他们的工业和培养教师、科学家和技术专家方面。”
    比万认为，应当开始现实地估计国际局势。他责备西方花费了几十亿英镑用来制造没有任何好处的武器和飞机，并且重新武装西德。
    比万还说，英国不必摹仿苏联的制度。但是他认为，苏联的经济和工业的成就是运用社会主义原则的结果。他说：“现在，它们能够培养出成千成万的科学家和技术专家，而我们却不重视我们的学校和大学。”
