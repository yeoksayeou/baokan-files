Seven Minority Language Survey Teams Depart

    Seven minority language survey teams, consisting of more than 600 people, began departing from Beijing on the 20th to Yunnan, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Guangxi, Guizhou, and other minority areas to investigate minority languages.

    This survey team is jointly organized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, various national colleges, and local minority language work institutions. They plan to conduct a general survey of the languages of all minority nationalities within two to three years and help some ethnic groups that need to create and reform written languages to design writing schemes.

Central Institute for Nationalities Establishes a History Department

    The Central Institute for Nationalities has decided to establish a history department. This department includes two majors: minority history and ethnology (humanities). This summer, it will recruit 80 undergraduate students through the unified college entrance examination in North China. The courses students in this department should take include basic courses of the history department of comprehensive universities, professional courses in minority history and ethnology, and ethnic language courses related to the major. The length of study is set at five years. In addition to professors and lecturers of history and ethnology from the Central Institute for Nationalities, a Soviet ethnology expert will be hired to guide teaching and scientific research in ethnology.

Telephone Lines Installed in Tibetan and Qiang Villages

    Telephone lines are being extended in the snow-capped mountains and dense forests of the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province. This year, nearly 1,000 kilometers of new lines will be erected in each county, and telephone lines have begun to be installed in many Tibetan and Qiang villages.

    Not long ago, Luobozhai, a Qiang village in Yanmen Ethnic Township, Wenchuan County, installed a telephone for the first time. Farmers often use the telephone to promptly consult with county and district leaders to solve production problems, without having to trek dozens of miles across mountains. In Meewo, Shalong and other townships in Xiaojin County, Tibetan and Han farmers used to lose contact with the outside world whenever heavy snow blocked the mountains. Now, these townships also have telephones.

    Currently, half of the districts and more than one-third of the townships in the autonomous prefecture have telephone access. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

Build Roads to the Buyi Areas

    The surveying of a highway traversing the Buyi areas of southern Guizhou has already begun.

    This highway starts from Ceheng County in the west, passes through Wangmo County, Luodian Buyi Autonomous County, and Pingtang County, intersects with Dushan County on the Qian-Gui Railway, and continues eastward through Sandu, Rongjiang, Congjiang, and other counties, finally reaching Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County in Guangxi Province. The highway will be approximately 600 kilometers long. This year, the detailed surveying of the 180-plus kilometers between Luodian Buyi Autonomous County and Sandu County will be completed first.

Xinjiang Renovates the Id Kah Mosque and the Tomb of Apak Hoja

    In order to preserve cultural relics and historical sites, the People's Committee of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has allocated 100,000 yuan to renovate the Id Kah Mosque and the Tomb of Apak Hoja in Kashgar. The Id Kah Mosque and the Tomb of Apak Hoja have a long history of construction, and the buildings themselves have a unique national artistic style and are famous historical sites in Xinjiang.

    The renovation projects for these two historical sites began successively in late April and early May. Now, the renovation project of the Id Kah Mosque has been basically completed. All doors and windows and more than 160 pillars in the temple have been painted with a brand-new look. All places have been painted, and various decorative patterns have been re-painted, and the forms and colors have been kept in the original style. The Tomb of Apak Hoja will be repaired with reinforced concrete and colored glazed bricks of the same color as the original, maintaining the original national form. The entire renovation project is expected to be completed in early July. (Tianshan Daily Editorial Department)

    The dozen or so works published in the inaugural issue are all novels, poems, and scripts created by young amateur authors such as workers, farmers, People's Liberation Army soldiers, and staff from all ethnic groups, including Qinghai folk songs compiled by farmers.

    一条条电话线正在四川省阿坝藏族自治州的雪山密林中伸展，今年各县新架线路将近一千公里，许多藏、羌族人民的村寨中开始装起了电话。
    不久前，汶川县雁门民族乡的羌族村寨——萝卜寨，第一次安装了电话机，农民们经常用电话及时向县、区领导机构请示解决生产上的问题，不用再翻山越岭走几十里路了。在小金县的美沃、沙龙等乡的藏、汉族农民，过去每逢大雪封山就和外界失去联系，现在这些乡也都有了电话。
