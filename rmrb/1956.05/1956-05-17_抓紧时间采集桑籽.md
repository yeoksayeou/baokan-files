Seize the Time to Collect Mulberry Seeds
Xu Shuying

In order to complete the silkworm cocoon production task of the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, silkworm cocoon producing areas are extensively cultivating mulberry seedlings and opening up new mulberry gardens this year. The biggest problem at present is the insufficient supply of mulberry seeds. Is it that there are no mulberry seeds? No, it is that many silkworm cocoon producing areas are requesting the transfer of mulberry seeds from other places, and have not focused their attention on how to collect local mulberry seeds. All silkworm cocoon producing areas should mobilize the masses to collect local mulberry seeds and implement self-collection, self-cultivation, and self-planting, which is the most reliable way to cultivate mulberry seedlings and open up new mulberry gardens.

In mid-to-late May, mulberry fruits ripen one after another. Ripe mulberry fruits are generally purple-black; there are also white mulberry fruits, which are milky white and glossy when ripe, with plump flesh and easy to fall off. When picking, choose mulberry trees that are strong and free from infectious diseases, and pick in batches according to the ripeness of the mulberry fruits. If the collected mulberry fruits cannot be washed on the same day, they should be spread out in a cool place, not piled up, to prevent heat from damaging the mulberry seeds and affecting germination. The first step after collecting the mulberry fruits is to remove the pulp. That is, put the mulberry fruits in a bucket or basin, add a small amount of plant ash, and knead them with hands, feet, or a wooden rake to separate the crushed pulp from the mulberry seeds, forming a pulp-like mixture. Put the kneaded pulp into a fine bamboo utensil or a sieve with a screen, immerse it in clean water and slowly wash it, floating away the light pulp and immature seeds. Because the mulberry seeds are very small, be careful when washing to prevent the loss of good seeds. After the mulberry seeds are washed, spread them thinly in a cool and ventilated place, turning them frequently to allow the seeds to dry thoroughly. Avoid piling them too thickly or drying them in the sun. After the mulberry seeds are dried in the shade, summer sowing can be carried out at the appropriate time. The germination rate of fresh mulberry seeds is generally above 95%. If they are not stored properly, the mulberry seeds will become hot or damp, which will cause most of the mulberry seeds to fail to germinate in a short period of time. Therefore, the storage of mulberry seeds must be done well. If there is a surplus of the collected mulberry seeds for personal use and they need to be transported to other places for sowing, attention must be paid to packaging. During transportation, prevent exposure to the sun, rain, stacking, heating, leakage, and other phenomena, so as not to affect germination and cause losses.

    抓紧时间采集桑籽
    徐淑英
    为了提前完成第一个五年计划中的蚕茧生产任务，今年各产蚕茧地区都大量培育桑苗和开辟新桑园。目前的最大问题是桑籽供应不足。是不是没有桑籽呢？不是的，而是许多蚕茧产区都要求从外地调剂桑籽，没有把注意力用在如何收集本地桑籽上。各产蚕地区应该发动群众采集本地桑籽，实行自采、自育、自栽，这是培育桑苗和开辟新桑园的最可靠的办法。
    五月中下旬桑果陆续成熟了。成熟的桑果一般是紫黑色；也有白桑果，成熟时是乳白色也有油光，果肉饱满，容易脱落。采摘时要选择生长强健无传染性病的桑树，根据桑果成熟迟早，分批采摘。采集的桑果，如果当天来不及淘洗，就要把它摊开放在阴凉地方，不要堆积，以防发热蒸坏桑籽，影响发芽。采好的桑果第一步先要去掉果肉。即把桑果放在桶内或盆内，加少量草木灰，用手、脚或木耙揉蹋，使果肉碎烂同桑籽分离，形成果浆状。把揉烂的果肉浆放在细密的竹器或箩面的箩里，浸入清水中慢慢淘洗，漂去轻浮的果肉和不成熟的种籽。由于桑籽很小，淘洗时要细心，防止损失好种。桑籽淘洗后，薄薄摊在阴凉通风的地方，时常翻动，使种子充分干燥，切忌堆得太厚及放在太阳下晒干。桑籽阴干后，就可以掌握适期进行夏播。新鲜桑籽的发芽率，一般在95％以上，如存放不好，桑籽发了热或受了潮，在短时期内都会使大部分桑籽不发芽。因此必须做好桑籽的贮存工作。如所采桑籽自用有余，要运往别地播种的，必须注意包装，运输途中要防止日晒、雨淋及堆压、发热、漏散等现象，以免影响发芽，造成损失。
