Hasten to Organize Fishmongers to Participate in Transport and Sales
    Zhao Wenjun
    In China's coastal fishing areas, every fishing season sees a large number of fishmongers, both full-time and part-time, using bicycles, wheelbarrows, and other means of transportation to transport fish and shrimp from the production areas to areas within a radius of one to two hundred *li*, allowing residents in these areas to enjoy inexpensive and high-quality fish and shrimp.
    However, since the start of this year's spring fishing season, the number of fishmongers has decreased significantly. In some areas of Shandong, the number of fishmongers has decreased by about 70%, and in some individual areas, by 90%. This has affected the transportation and sale of fish and shrimp.
    The reason for this phenomenon is, on the one hand, that most fishmongers have joined agricultural and fishery production cooperatives, and the cooperatives have heavy production tasks and insufficient labor. But more importantly, many agricultural cooperatives neglect sideline production and have not made reasonable arrangements for it. Some areas have set particularly low labor remuneration for fishmongering, and some cooperatives have stipulated unreasonable systems, such as requiring members who transport fish for one day to first pay the cooperative a "work point" in cash as income for the cooperative. If they still make money after paying the work point, individuals can get 70%, and the cooperative gets 30%; if they lose money, individuals bear 70%, and the cooperative bears 30%. This means that fishmongers must earn enough work points in a day to be able to transport fish, and they will lose money if they don't earn enough "work points." In fact, it is difficult to determine how much money can be made from fishmongering. Sometimes the money earned may be less than the work points, and fishmongers will naturally be unwilling to transport fish anymore. In some individual places, cooperatives treat fishmongers as speculators and discriminate against them politically.
    Now is the peak season for fish production, and it is necessary to strengthen the transportation force in fishing areas. Agricultural cooperatives in various places should properly arrange agricultural and sideline production and reasonably resolve issues such as the calculation of work points, losses, and profit distribution during the fishmongering period for their members. Organizing cooperative members to transport fish not only supports fishermen in increasing production, but also benefits the revitalization of the rural economy, increases the income of cooperative members, and consolidates and develops agricultural cooperatives. After paying attention to organizing fishmongers to transport fish and shrimp in various places, aquatic product supply and marketing departments must pay attention to providing fishmongers with a source of goods and strengthening their organization and leadership.

    赶快组织鱼贩参加运销
    赵文钧
    在我国沿海渔产区，每到渔汛期，就有大批专营和兼营的鱼贩，利用自行车、独轮推车等交通工具，把产地的鱼虾贩运到方圆一、二百里路的地区去，使这些地区的居民可以吃到物美价廉的鱼虾。
    但是，今年春汛开始后，鱼贩大大减少了。山东有些地区，鱼贩人数减少了70％左右，个别地区减少了90％。这就影响了鱼虾的运销。
    发生这种现象的原因，一方面固然是因为大部分鱼贩都参加了农业和渔业生产合作社，合作社的生产任务大，劳动力不充裕。但更主要的是有很多农业合作社忽视副业生产，对副业生产没有做合理的安排。有的地区对贩鱼的劳动报酬定得特别低，有的社规定了一些不合理的制度，如规定社员贩运一天鱼，要先向合作社交一天“工分”的现金，作为合作社的收入，如果交了工分后还赚钱，个人可得70％，社内分30％；赔了钱，个人负担70％，社内负担30％。这就是说：鱼贩一天必须赚够工分才能贩鱼，赚不到“工分”就要赔钱。事实上贩鱼能赚多少钱很难定，有时可能赚的钱低于工分，鱼贩自然就不愿再贩鱼。也有个别地方合作社把鱼贩当成投机商，在政治上歧视他们。
    现在正是渔产旺季，必须加强渔产区的贩运力量。各地农业合作社应该把农、副业安排得当，并且合理解决社员贩鱼期间的工分计算、亏损、利润处理等问题。合作社组织社员贩鱼，不但支援了渔民增产，同时对活跃农村经济，增加社员收入，巩固和发展农业社都是有利的。在各地注意组织鱼贩贩运鱼虾后，水产供销部门必须注意给鱼贩货源，并加强对他们的组织领导。
