Japan General Council of Trade Unions Protests U.S. Nuclear Weapons Tests
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th. The Japan General Council of Trade Unions sent a telegram to U.S. President Eisenhower on the 9th, protesting U.S. nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific.

    Head of an American Social Group Says
    U.S. Hydrogen Bomb Tests Disregard Humanitarianism
    Xinhua News Agency, New York, 9th. The "New York Times" of May 8 published a letter from Lee Bibb, Executive Secretary of the National Committee for the Prevention of War, a U.S. social group, condemning the U.S. government's hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific.
    Bibb said in the letter that the U.S. government's insistence on conducting hydrogen bomb tests in the Pacific is a disregard for humanitarianism. He said: "Japan has already suffered greatly from our atomic bomb tests. Dropping the first atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki after we had virtually won the war was one of the outstanding crimes of this century. Eleven years after the end of the war, we are contaminating the fish and drinking water on which the Japanese people depend for their survival, which is our unprovoked abuse of power over the Japanese people." The letter pointed out that this measure by the United States has aroused anger throughout Japan.
    Prominent New Zealand Figures Call For
    Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and Disarmament
    Xinhua News Agency, Auckland, 9th. New Zealand's "People's Voice" reported on May 2 that about one hundred prominent New Zealand figures have called on Parliament to support the prohibition of nuclear weapons and disarmament.
    Those calling for this include pastors, university professors, teachers, and writers. They pointed out that the continued arms race seriously endangers international peace. Therefore, if we want to eliminate the widespread unease and distrust and avoid disaster, disarmament is a very important condition and must be accomplished.
    The appeal calls for the prohibition of all weapons of mass destruction, including atomic and hydrogen bombs, a significant reduction of all other armaments, and the immediate adoption of steps to reach an international agreement to cease nuclear weapons testing.

    The telegram demanded that Eisenhower stop the test.
    British Labour MP Questions British Government
    Why Has it Retreat on the Disarmament Issue
    Xinhua News Agency, London, 9th. According to TASS, London, 8th: Labour MPs are dissatisfied with the British government's retreating attitude on the disarmament issue. Henderson questioned Nadine, the British representative attending the London Disarmament Conference, in the House of Commons, saying: "Why has the British government changed its attitude (on the disarmament issue)?"
    When Nadine gave a report to the House of Commons on the progress of the disarmament conference, he attempted to blame the Soviet Union for the lack of progress, avoiding the fact that Western countries immediately abandoned their own proposals as soon as the Soviet Union supported them.
    Nadine also emphasized in his report the position of Western countries: that the solution of the disarmament issue depends on the solution of outstanding international political issues.
    Cries of "Why?" were issued from the Labour MPs' seats.
    Labour leader Gaitskell said: "The Labour Party is dissatisfied with the British government's insistence on making a political settlement a prerequisite during the negotiations." Gaitskell also said: "If a common comprehensive disarmament measure can truly be reached, that would also be the best way to achieve a political settlement."
    Labour MPs insisted on a debate on the disarmament issue in the House of Commons recently. Nadine promised to convey this request to the government.
    Amidst the Unanimous Demand for Peace From People of All Countries
    U.S. Department of Defense Requests Increased Military Appropriations
    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 10th. Washington news: U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee subcommittee on the 8th, requesting Congress to allocate $36.2 billion for the 1956-57 fiscal year as funding for expanding armaments. This is the largest sum the Department of Defense has requested in the past four years. According to Wilson, the Department of Defense's actual total expenditure in the new fiscal year will be $36 billion. This means that the United States will spend close to $100 million per day on military purposes. Wilson also pointed out that in the 1957 fiscal year, the Department of Defense's planned direct contracts amount to $38.4 billion. Spending on military research will be 38% more than in the current fiscal year, at $5.2 billion.

    美国一社会团体的负责人说
    美国试验氢弹是无视人道主义
    新华社9日讯  纽约消息：五月八日的“纽约时报”刊载了美国的一个社会团体“防止战争全国委员会”的执行秘书李毕的一封信，信里谴责美国政府在太平洋举行氢弹试验。
    李毕在信里说，美国政府坚持在太平洋上进行氢弹试验一事是无视人道主义。他说：“日本已经从我们的原子弹试验受到很大苦难。我们在战争实际上已经得到胜利后在广岛和长崎投掷第一批原子弹是本世纪的突出罪行之一。我们在战争结束后十一年又使日本人赖以生存的鱼和饮水受到沾染，是我们对日本人民的无故滥用权力。”信里指出，美国这种措施已经引起日本全国的愤怒。
    新西兰著名人士呼吁
    禁止核子武器和裁减军备
    新华社9日讯  奥克兰消息：新西兰“人民之声报”五月二日报道，约一百名新西兰著名人士要求议会支持禁止核子武器和裁减军备的主张。
    呼吁的人包括牧师、大学教授、教师和作家。他们指出，继续进行军备竞赛使国际和平受到严重危害。因此，如果要消除普遍存在的不安和不信任以及避免灾祸的话，裁军是非常重要的条件，并且必须完成。
    呼吁书要求禁止所有大规模毁灭性武器，包括原子弹和氢弹，大大削减所有其他的军备，并且立即采取步骤，以便达成国际协议，不再进行核子武器试验。

    英工党议员质问英政府
    为什么在裁军问题上后退
    新华社9日讯  据塔斯社伦敦八日讯：工党议员不满英国政府在裁军问题上的后退态度。汉德逊在下议院向出席伦敦裁军会议的英国代表纳丁提出质问说：“为什么英国政府改变了自己（在裁军问题上）的态度？”
    纳丁在向下议院作关于裁军会议工作情况的报告的时候，企图把工作没有取得进展的责任推在苏联身上，避而不谈西方国家在苏联刚一支持它们提出的裁军建议它们就马上放弃自己的建议的事实。
    纳丁还在报告里强调指出西方国家的立场：裁军问题的解决取决于悬而未决的国际政治问题的解决。
    从工党议员的席位里向纳丁发出了“为什么？”的喊声。
    工党领袖盖次克尔说：“工党不满意英国政府在谈判过程中过于固执地坚持把政治解决作为先决条件。”盖次克尔还说：“如果真正能够达到一个共同的全面裁军措施，那也是取得政治解决的最好的办法。”
    工党议员都坚持主张最近在下院就裁军问题进行辩论。纳丁答应把这个要求转达给政府。
