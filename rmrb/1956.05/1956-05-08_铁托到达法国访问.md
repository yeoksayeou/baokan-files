Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch from Prague: Belgrade dispatch: Yugoslav President Tito left Belgrade on the 5th for a visit to Paris at the invitation of French President Coty. He was accompanied by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Popović, Secretary-General to the President Vilfan, and others.

Before his departure, Tito made a statement to reporters from Agence France-Presse and the Yugoslav News Agency. He said: "I believe that this visit to France is not only a courtesy visit, but also an intention on both sides to exchange views on issues related to the mutual relations between the two countries and on various issues of common concern in international affairs. I believe that our talks with the French representatives will be successful and beneficial, especially because we are going to France at a time when the world is permeated with the view that only direct contact and exchange of views can eliminate many misunderstandings and help mutual understanding."

　　铁托到达法国访问
    新华社7日讯  巴黎消息：南斯拉夫总统铁托应法国总统戈蒂的邀请，在七日乘火车到达巴黎访问。法国总统戈蒂、总理摩勒、外交部长比诺等人都到巴黎车站欢迎。
    戈蒂在车站授予铁托军事勋章，对铁托在第二次世界大战期间对反法西斯的共同事业作出的贡献表示尊敬。戈蒂接着陪同铁托乘敞篷汽车赴总统府。沿途巴黎居民对客人们鼓掌欢迎。
    新华社布拉格7日电  贝尔格莱德消息：南斯拉夫总统铁托应法国总统戈蒂的邀请，在五日离贝尔格莱德前往巴黎访问。陪同前往的有外交国务秘书长波波维奇、总统秘书长维尔凡等。
    铁托在启程前对法新社和南斯拉夫通讯社记者发表了谈话。他说：“我认为，这次前往法国访问不仅是礼节上的访问，而且双方还打算就有关两国相互关系的问题以及在国际事务方面共同关心的各种问题交换意见。我相信，我们同法国代表们的会谈将是成功的和有益的，特别是因为我们前往法国的时候，正值世界流行着这样的意见：只有直接接触和交换意见才能够消除许多误会和有助于互相了解。
