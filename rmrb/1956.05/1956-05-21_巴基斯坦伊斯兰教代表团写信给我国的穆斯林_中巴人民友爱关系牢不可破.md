Xinhua News Agency, May 20th: After a three-day visit in Beijing, the Pakistani Islamic delegation, led by the head of the delegation, Grand Mullah Ehtesham-ul-Haq and Sayyid Hussaini (Imam), took a plane today to visit Muslim-populated areas in China, such as Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Urumqi.

During their stay in Beijing, the delegation paid visits to the leaders of the China Islamic Association, visited the China Islamic Institute and the Beijing Hui Nationality Institute, and received a warm welcome from all teachers and students of these two institutes. They also visited the Dongsi Pailou Mosque, the Niujie Mosque, the Department of Oriental Languages of Peking University, visited the famous historical sites of the capital and the Beijing Hui Nationality Cemetery, and held cordial talks with some Ahongs in Beijing.

After a series of friendly activities, the delegation members unanimously said: China is indeed a country with freedom of religious belief. Grand Mullah Qadri said that the Chinese government treats Muslims very favorably. The delegation members also wrote a poem about this situation, saying: What our eyes have seen and our ears have heard cannot be eliminated by any force. They believe that this visit is of great help to understanding the new China and promoting the friendship between Pakistan and China.

These Pakistani religious figures also wrote a greeting letter to Chinese Muslims.

The greeting letter said that the messenger of Islamic friendship came to your country from the holy land of Medina through its Muslim missionaries, and Islamic history proves these great and deep-rooted relationships between China and Islam. The greeting letter also said that there may be ideological differences between one country and another, and each country believes in the ideology that it considers best for itself, but between us there is an unbreakable and eternal friendship.

The greeting letter said that we not only bring you the greetings of Pakistani religious figures, but also the greetings of the entire Pakistani people. We brought friendly greetings from Pakistan and assure you that the hearts of the Pakistani people are filled with love for their Chinese brothers. Last year, when your Hajj pilgrimage delegation passed through Karachi, we had the opportunity to meet Nur Muhammad Dapusheng. During our meeting, we inquired in detail about your well-being and your progress. Only then did we know about the religious freedom you enjoy. Nur Muhammad Dapusheng also left us some books that we were very happy to read. Finally, we witnessed the religious freedom you enjoy.

The greeting letter pointed out that Pakistani religious leaders are fully aware of the prestige your government enjoys in the Asian countries' etiquette. We fully recognize your country's right to a seat in the United Nations, just like any other free country. We warmly look forward to the increase of friendship between our two countries in political and economic aspects, and we eagerly hope that our two governments will continue to work hard to strengthen this friendly relationship. Our government has been working hard to develop relations with China; we hope that our Prime Minister's upcoming visit to China will be a further concrete contribution to this effort. Such mutual visits and contacts will undoubtedly promote mutual understanding and progress.

    巴基斯坦伊斯兰教代表团写信给我国的穆斯林
    中巴人民友爱关系牢不可破
    新华社20日讯　巴基斯坦伊斯兰教代表团在北京参观访问了三天以后，今天由团长大毛拉·埃特沙穆尔·哈克和赛义德·侯赛尼（依玛木）率领，乘飞机去西安、兰州、乌鲁木齐等中国穆斯林聚居地区访问。
    代表团在北京期间，曾经拜会了中国伊斯兰教协会的负责人，访问了中国伊斯兰教经学院和北京回民学院，受到了这两个学院全体师生的热烈欢迎。他们还访问了东四牌楼清真寺、牛街清真寺、北京大学东语系，参观了首都的名胜古迹和北京回民公墓，并且同北京的一些阿訇举行了亲密的座谈。
    代表团团员们经过一系列的友好活动以后，异口同声地说：中国确实是宗教信仰自由的。大毛拉·夸德里说，中国政府对待穆斯林是很优厚的。代表团团员还就此情况写了一首诗歌说：我们的眼睛所看到的，耳朵所听到的，是什么力量也消灭不了的。他们认为，这次访问对新中国的了解和对促进巴中两国的友谊都有很大帮助。
    这些巴基斯坦宗教家们还写了一封给中国穆斯林的问候信。
    问候信说，伊斯兰教的友爱使者通过它的穆斯林传教士们从麦地那圣地来到贵国，伊斯兰的历史证明了中国和伊斯兰教间这些伟大的根深蒂固的关系。问候信又说，一个国家和另一个国家间，可能有思想意识上的分歧，每一国家都信奉它认为对自己是最好的思想，但是在我们之间却有着牢不可破的永恒的友爱关系。
    问候信说，我们不仅给你们带来了巴基斯坦宗教家们的问候，而且带来了整个巴基斯坦人民的问候。我们从巴基斯坦带来了友爱的致意，并向你们保证：巴基斯坦人的心里充满了对他们中国弟兄们的热爱。去年，当你们的哈吉朝觐团经过喀喇蚩时，我们有机会遇到努尔·穆罕默德·达浦生。在我们会晤的时候，我们详细地询问了你们安宁以及你们的进展情况。我们这才知道了你们所享受的宗教自由。努尔·穆罕默德·达浦生还给我们留下一些我们极高兴阅读的书籍。最后，我们目睹你们所享受的宗教自由。
    问候信指出，巴基斯坦的宗教领袖们完全晓得你们政府在亚洲国家礼让中所享受的威信。我们完全承认贵国在联合国中的席位权利，就和其它任何自由国家一样。我们热烈地期待着我们两国间在政治和经济方面友谊的增加，并且迫切地希望我们两国政府不断努力加强这种友好关系。我们的政府一直在努力发展和中国的关系；我们希望我们总理即将来中国的访问将是这种努力的进一步的具体贡献。这种互相访问和接触无疑地将会促进相互谅解和进步。
