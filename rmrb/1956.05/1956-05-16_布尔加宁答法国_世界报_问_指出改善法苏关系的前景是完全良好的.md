Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 14th: On the eve of French Prime Minister Mollet and Foreign Minister Pineau's visit to the Soviet Union, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin answered some questions raised by the French "Le Monde."

Bulganin said that the Soviet government believes that the prospects for improving relations between France and the Soviet Union are entirely favorable. The commonality of fundamental national interests between France and the Soviet Union necessitates our constant cooperation in the struggle to consolidate peace. There is currently no international issue that could become an insurmountable obstacle to the development of friendship and cooperation between the two countries.

Bulganin said that it is not yet possible to predict in advance what the outcome of the upcoming talks will be, but he expressed his belief that the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister's visit to Moscow will contribute to mutual understanding and rapprochement between the two countries, as well as further easing international tensions.

Bulganin said that there is a great possibility for the Soviet Union and France to consolidate and expand their trade and cultural ties. This possibility must be turned into reality. The Soviet government is willing to significantly increase the volume of trade between France and the Soviet Union on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and non-discrimination, according to long-term agreements.

Bulganin reiterated that the Soviet Union is pursuing a policy of peaceful coexistence. He said that the principle of peaceful coexistence is the foundation of the foreign policy of the Soviet Union and many other countries in Asia and Europe. This situation is logical, because under the current conditions, there is no other way out except peaceful coexistence or a destructive war. Bulganin said that the Five Principles are the best form of interaction between countries with different social systems under the current conditions. If all countries agree to these Five Principles, it would be in line with the vital interests and demands of all peoples.

When discussing the issue of disarmament, Bulganin emphasized that efforts should be made to bring the positions of the Western powers and the Soviet Union closer on the issue of disarmament. He said that the Soviet Union has repeatedly moved closer to the views of the Western powers, but every time the Soviet Union accepted the suggestions of the Western countries, they immediately retracted their suggestions. Despite this, we must continue to make unremitting efforts to reduce armaments, ban atomic weapons, and establish effective international supervision.

Bulganin pointed out that the resolution of the disarmament issue should not be dependent on the resolution of the German question. He said that the disarmament issue and the German question are two different issues. The disarmament issue is the most important and urgent issue in current world politics.

In answering a question about North Africa, Bulganin expressed his welcome for the resolution of the independence issues of Tunisia and Morocco through negotiations, and he expressed his belief that the Algerian question could also be resolved peacefully.

    布尔加宁答法国“世界报”问
    指出改善法苏关系的前景是完全良好的
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科十四日消息：在法国总理摩勒和外交部长比诺去访问苏联的前夕，苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁答复了法国“世界报”提出的一些问题。
    布尔加宁说，苏联政府认为，改善法苏两国关系的前景是完全良好的。法苏两国根本的民族利益的共同性，使我们必须在争取巩固和平的斗争中进行经常的合作。现在没有一个国际问题足以成为两国发展友谊和合作的不可克服的障碍。
    布尔加宁说，现在还不能预先断定，即将举行的会谈结果会怎么样，但是，他表示相信，法国总理和外交部长访问莫斯科将有助于两国之间的彼此谅解和互相接近以及进一步缓和国际紧张局势。
    布尔加宁说，苏联和法国有很大的可能性，来巩固和扩大它们的贸易和文化联系。必须要把这种可能性变成现实。苏联政府愿意在平等互利、没有任何歧视的条件下，根据长期协定来大大增加法苏两国的贸易额。
    布尔加宁重申苏联执行着和平共处的政策。他说，和平共处原则是苏联和欧亚两洲许多其他国家外交政策的基础。这种情况是合乎规律的，因为在目前的条件下不是和平共处就是进行毁灭性战争，没有别的出路。布尔加宁说，五项原则是不同社会制度的国家在目前条件下最好的相处形式。如果所有的国家都同意这五项原则，那是符合各国人民的切身利益和要求的。
    在谈到裁军问题时，布尔加宁强调应该设法使西方大国和苏联在裁军问题上的立场接近。他说，苏联曾经多次向西方大国的意见靠拢，但是，每当苏联接受西方国家的建议，他们又立刻把自己的建议撤了回去。尽管这样，我们仍然要继续为裁减军备、禁止原子武器和建立有效的国际监督而作坚持不懈的斗争。
    布尔加宁指出，不应该把裁军问题的解决取决于德国问题的解决。他说，裁军问题和德国问题是两个不同的问题。裁军问题是当前世界政治中最首要的、不能拖延的问题。
    在回答关于北非的问题时，布尔加宁表示欢迎突尼斯和摩洛哥独立问题通过谈判得到解决，他表示相信阿尔及利亚问题也可以通过和平方式来解决。
