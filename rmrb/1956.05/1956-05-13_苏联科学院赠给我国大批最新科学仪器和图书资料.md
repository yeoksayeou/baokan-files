Xinhua News Agency, 12th. The President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guo Moruo, accepted today a large number of valuable gifts from the Soviet Academy of Sciences: scientific instruments, materials, books, and films, many of which China had never possessed before. These gifts were presented by the delegation of Soviet scientists who are helping China compile its national long-term science plan.

At the grand presentation ceremony held at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Soviet scientists, led by Mikhailov, explained these gifts separately.

Among the thirty-odd precision instruments and materials were samples of parts for high-speed electronic computers, marking the latest achievements of modern science; six volumes of books explaining the structure of high-speed electronic computers; hundreds of semiconductor diodes and triodes, which are far superior to vacuum tubes; and the best semiconductor raw material – germanium. Among these precision instruments were also tracers for studying cosmic rays, electronic automatic potentiometers and bridges, pulse calculators, universal voltmeters, control panels, universal rectifiers, etc.

This batch of precious gifts also included 300 kinds of scientific books, magazines, and materials covering more than 20 disciplines, more than 10 scientific films, and the "Scientific Bulletin" presented by the Academy of Sciences of the Moldavian Republic.
