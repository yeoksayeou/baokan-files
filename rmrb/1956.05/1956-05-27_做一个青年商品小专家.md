    Become a Young Commodity Expert
    Xiao Feng

    A significant activity – "Become a Young Commodity Expert" – is being widely launched among young salespersons in state-owned and joint state-private commercial enterprises in Shanghai. Young salespersons participating in this activity must systematically study and master the basic knowledge of the commodities they manage, cultivate themselves into experts in their respective fields, and better serve customers.

    The "Become a Young Commodity Expert" activity was initiated at the end of March by Yang Shilin, a Shanghai model worker, and eight other young salespersons. After this initiative was put forward, it quickly received a response from young salespersons in the city's commercial departments. Young salespersons in various industries have successively formulated advanced study plans and have begun to learn relevant professional knowledge. Yang Shilin, one of the initiators and a salesperson at the Non-Ferrous Metals Department of the Second Steel Store of the Hardware Company, signed a teaching contract with the four salespeople in his department, planning to basically master the commodity knowledge they manage before the end of April. He has now learned the conversion method of metric and imperial weights and has started a new course. Wang Shulian of the First Pharmacy Company formulated a plan on the same day the initiative was announced, guaranteeing to master the performance, use, specifications, and sources of all the commodities on his counter in April and May, to understand the categories of commodities on other counters within three months, and to be familiar with 50% of the commodities sold in the store within one year. On the 13th, thirty-eight young salespersons from the First State-Owned Pharmacy Company listened to the first lesson given by a pharmacist – professional knowledge and pharmacological properties of external medicines. Young salespersons from the State-Owned Electrical Materials Store, the State-Owned Department Store No. 1, the Women's Goods Store, and the Children's Goods Store recently visited electrical appliance factories and knitting factories, respectively, and listened to workers and technicians introduce general knowledge of the production of related commodities. The Young Communist League organization of the Electrical Materials Store also hired five experienced adult employees as "commodity teachers" to guide young salespersons in learning the knowledge of installing electrical materials, lighting equipment, bakelite electrical appliances, and wires. With the help of a commodity teacher, young salesperson Gao Weiqing is compiling a handbook on managing fluorescent lamps to provide other salespersons with familiarity in this area.

    Commercial work is not simply a transaction of buying and selling goods, but a work that requires mastering and applying various specialized scientific knowledge. If salespeople fully master professional knowledge, they can not only better serve customers and help them buy satisfactory goods, but also play a guiding role for production departments. Therefore, the "Become a Young Commodity Expert" activity is a meaningful initiative by Shanghai's commercial youth and a concrete action for commercial youth to respond to the call of the Central Committee of the Young Communist League and march toward science and culture.

    The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Young Communist League has regarded this activity as an effective way to mobilize the city's commercial youth to participate in the current advanced producer movement.

    做一个青年商品小专家
    萧凤
    一个具有重要意义的活动——“做一个青年商品小专家”，正在上海市国营和公私合营商业的青年营业员中广泛展开。参加这个活动的青年营业员，都要系统地学习和掌握自己所经营的商品的基本知识，把自己培养成本业的专家，更好地为顾客服务。
    “做一个青年商品小专家”的活动，是三月底上海市劳动模范杨仕林等八个青年营业员倡议的。这个倡议提出以后，很快就得到了全市商业部门青年营业员的响应。各行业的青年营业员相继订出了进修计划，并且开始学习有关的业务知识。倡议人之一，五金公司第二钢铁商店有色金属门市部杨仕林和本部门的四个销货员签订了教学合同，计划在四月底以前基本上掌握自己所经营的商品知识。现在他已经学会了公制、英制的重量换算法，并且开始了新的课程。医药公司第一商店王树廉在倡议公布的当天，就订出了计划，保证在四、五两个月内掌握自己柜台上全部商品的性能、用途、规格和来源，在三个月内了解其他各柜商品的类别，在一年内熟悉本店经营的50％的商品。国营医药公司第一商店的三十八个青年营业员在十三日听了药剂师讲的第一课——外用药品的业务知识和药理性能。国营电料商店和国营第一百货商店、妇女用品商店、儿童用品商店的青年营业员们最近分别参观了电器工厂和针织工厂，听工人和技术人员介绍了有关商品的生产常识。电料商店的青年团组织还聘请了五位有经验的成年职工当“商品老师”，辅导青年营业员学习安装电料、照明器材、胶木电器和电线等商品的知识。青年营业员高渭清在商品老师帮助下，正在编写一本经营日光灯的手册，提供别的营业员熟悉这方面的业务。
    商业工作不是简单地买卖商品的事务活动，而是需要掌握和运用各种专门科学知识的工作。营业员充分掌握了业务知识，不仅可以更好地为顾客服务，帮助顾客买到称心的商品，而且对生产部门也可以起指导作用。因此，“做一个青年商品小专家”的活动是上海市商业青年的一个有意义的创举，是商业青年响应青年团中央的号召，向科学文化进军的具体行动。
    青年团上海市委会已经把这个活动作为发动全市商业青年参加当前先进生产者运动的一个有效办法。
