Xinhua News Agency, 13th - The Beijing Municipal People's Committee held two plenary sessions on the 11th and 12th to discuss and deploy the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, handicrafts, and agriculture, as well as future tasks.

The meeting pointed out that after the implementation of joint state-private ownership by the whole trade in Beijing's capitalist industry, the work of clearing assets and valuing property was completed in a very short time. Among the thirty industries assigned to industrial transformation, seventeen industries such as leather and rubber have completed production reorganization, and thirteen industries such as metal products manufacturing, shoes, and hats are currently being reorganized. With the progress of production reorganization, appropriate arrangements have been made for capitalist personnel in substantive positions, and many worker cadres have been promoted. After reorganization and factory mergers, the implementation of professional division of labor and adjustment of equipment have significantly improved production in most factories. The output value of the rubber industry in the first quarter of this year increased by 40% compared with the same period last year; the output of leather shoes in the city in March increased by 70% compared with January, and the return rate decreased from 30% to 8%.

Experience shows that the key to doing a good job in production reorganization is to fully mobilize and rely on all employees, discuss and formulate reorganization plans, and jointly study and solve problems such as the utilization of factory buildings and equipment, the allocation of worker technical conditions, and the arrangement of old cooperative relationships. Moreover, it is necessary to proceed from reality, pay attention to retaining and developing product characteristics and special technologies, and prevent blind centralization or elimination. For service industries, consideration should be given to the convenience of residents, and points should not be withdrawn and centralized casually. In the reorganization, special attention should be paid to not reducing product quality or reducing varieties. The meeting requested that factories that have completed production reorganization further mobilize the masses to carry out socialist competition focusing on improving product quality, trial-producing new products, and improving production management.

After the implementation of joint state-private ownership by the whole trade in capitalist commerce, the turnover has generally increased, and some stores have initially improved their service quality. In order to facilitate the masses' purchase of goods and arrange for some households experiencing operating difficulties due to improper store location, thirty-one commercial industries in the city have initially adjusted and are adjusting the commercial network. After the adjustment of the department store industry, the commercial network has expanded, and coupled with sufficient supply of goods, the turnover has increased significantly. The turnover of department stores in the Qianmen district in early April increased by more than 40% compared with the second half of March before the adjustment. In the adjustment, industries with a generally reasonable distribution were generally not concentrated or merged. Industries whose supply targets were mainly institutions and enterprises (such as industrial raw materials) and industries with too many households experiencing operating difficulties were concentrated or merged to a greater extent. Some stores that were too densely distributed were relocated to areas with insufficient stores.

The meeting believed that the main tasks of handicrafts at present are: vigorously rectify the organization, consolidate new cooperatives, make arrangements for production and sales, do a good job in production, rapidly improve product quality, reduce costs, and increase product varieties and quantities, so that the income of the vast majority of cooperative members after joining the cooperative is higher than before joining the cooperative.

The meeting finally pointed out that the main task of agricultural production in the suburbs this year is to increase the average yield by about 30% on the basis of the overall increase in production last year. And strive for 90% of cooperative members to increase their income. The meeting requested agricultural production cooperatives to vigorously promote agricultural science and technology and advanced experience in increasing production, make the greatest efforts to rectify and consolidate the work of cooperatives, effectively strengthen production planning management and labor management, conscientiously implement the policy of "running cooperatives diligently and frugally," establish and improve livestock breeding and service systems, do a good job in livestock breeding and the protection of young animals, and run all cooperatives better.

    北京市人民委员会举行会议
    讨论和布置社会主义改造工作
    新华社13日讯　北京市人民委员会十一、十二两日举行了两次全体委员会议，讨论和布置资本主义工商业、手工业和农业的社会主义改造工作和今后任务。
    会议指出，北京市资本主义工业全行业公私合营后，在很短时间内完成了清产估价工作。在三十个划归工业改造的行业中，目前已经有制革、橡胶等十七个行业完成了生产改组工作，正在改组的有金属品制造、鞋帽等十三个行业。随着生产改组的进行，对资方实职人员都作了妥善安排，并且提拔了很多工人干部，经过改组并厂，实行专业分工，调整了设备，多数工厂生产有了显著提高。橡胶业今年第一季度生产的产值比去年同期增加了40％；全市皮鞋厂三月份产量比一月份提高70％，退修率由30％降到8％。
    根据经验说明：做好生产改组工作的关键，必须充分发动和依靠全体职工，讨论和制订改组规划，共同研究解决厂房、设备利用，工人技术条件的配备，旧的协作关系的安排等问题。并且要从实际出发，注意保留和发扬产品特点和特殊技术，防止盲目集中或淘汰。对服务性行业，要考虑到对居民的方便，不能随便撤点集中。在改组中要特别注意不能降低产品质量和减少品种。会议要求已完成生产改组的工厂要进一步发动群众，开展以提高产品质量、试制新产品和改进生产管理为重点的社会主义竞赛。
    资本主义商业全行业公私合营后，营业额普遍都增加了，有些商店初步改进了服务质量。为了便利群众购买商品，和安排一部分户因店址设置不当而造成的经营困难，全市三十一个商业行业已有二十七个行业初步调整了和正在调整商业网。百货业调整后商业网扩大了，加上货源充足，营业额增加很多。前门区的百货商店四月上旬的营业额比调整前的三月下半月增加了40％以上。在调整中，对原来分布大体合理的行业，一般都不集中合并，对于供应对象主要是机关、企业的行业（如工业原料）和因户数过多使经营困难的行业，都进行了较大程度的集中或合并。有些商店过于密集，都迁移一部分到商店不足的地区。
    会议认为，手工业当前的主要任务是：大力整顿组织，巩固新社，作好产销安排，搞好生产，迅速提高产品质量，降低成本，增加产品品种和数量，使绝大多数社员入社后的收入比入社前增加。
    会议最后指出，今年郊区农业生产的主要任务，是在去年全面增产的基础上，平均产量再增加30％左右。并且争取90％的社员都增加收入。会议要求农业生产合作社要大力推行农业科学技术和先进的增产经验，用最大的努力进行整顿巩固合作社的工作，切实加强生产计划管理和劳动管理，认真贯彻执行“勤俭办社”的方针，建立和健全牲畜饲养、使役制度，做好牲畜的繁殖和幼畜的保护工作，把所有的合作社办得更好。
