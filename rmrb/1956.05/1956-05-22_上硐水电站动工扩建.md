Following the construction of the Shizitan Hydropower Station on the Longxi River in Sichuan, the expansion project of the Shangdong Hydropower Station has fully commenced. The Shangdong Hydropower Station expansion project is the development of the second cascade of the Longxi River. Currently under construction are the waterproof wall of the dam, the spillway tunnel, and the foundation of the powerhouse; some machines have also begun to be installed. This expansion project started construction in the first quarter of this year and will be fully completed and start generating electricity before National Day this year. Its power generation will be more than doubled compared to the original.

The survey work for the technical design stage of the third cascade of the Longxi River – the Huilongzhai Hydropower Station – has been basically completed, and preparations for construction are actively underway.

The total power generation of these two hydropower stations after completion will be equivalent to more than 55% of that of the Shizitan Hydropower Station. This will provide more cheap electricity to the booming industry in the Chongqing area. (Xinhua News Agency)

    上硐水电站动工扩建
    在四川龙溪河上，继狮子滩水电站兴建以后，上硐水电站扩建工程已经全面动工。上硐水电站扩建工程是开发龙溪河第二梯级的工程。目前开工的有拦河坝的防水墙、泄水硐、厂房基础等；部分机器也开始安装。这项扩建工程是从今年第一季度开始施工的，将在今年国庆节前全部完成，并且开始发电。它的发电量要比原来增大两倍以上。
    现在龙溪河第三梯级——回龙寨水电站技术设计阶段的勘测工作已经基本完成，正在积极准备施工。
    这两座水电站建设完成以后的总发电量，将相当于狮子滩水电站的55％以上。这将给正在蓬勃发展的重庆地区的工业，提供更多的廉价电力。　（新华社）
