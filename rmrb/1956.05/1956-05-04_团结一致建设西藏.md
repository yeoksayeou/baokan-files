(Summary of the speech by Living Buddha Chijiang·Losang Yexi, representative of the Dalai Lama, at the Lhasa rally celebrating the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region)

Living Buddha Chijiang first pointed out: Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and the great leader Chairman Mao, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has been formally established. This is a brilliant achievement of the Chinese Communist Party's policy. It not only demonstrates the further unity within Tibet, but also signifies the increasingly consolidated and developing unity and cooperation among the fraternal nationalities of the motherland. This is an unprecedented great undertaking of major historical significance in the political life of the Tibetan people. This should be rejoiced not only by the Tibetan people but also by all ethnic groups in the motherland.

At the time of the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the central delegation headed by Vice Premier Chen came to congratulate us, for which we express our heartfelt gratitude with infinite excitement; at the same time, we ask the representatives to give us more valuable instructions and help.

Living Buddha Chijiang then spoke in detail about the historical situation and life contrast before and after the peaceful liberation of Tibet. He said that in the past few years, thanks to the joint efforts of the People's Liberation Army in Tibet and all the monks and lay people of Tibet, we have made great achievements in implementing the agreement.

Living Buddha Chijiang said: Tibet is the central region of Lamaism, and all the people have a high degree of belief in Lamaism. The people value and protect their religious beliefs as if they were their lives. In the past few years, the People's Liberation Army in Tibet and the working personnel have abided by the policy of freedom of religious belief, protected the Lama temples, and respected the people's beliefs, and the brotherly friendship and cooperation between the Han and Tibetan peoples has developed and strengthened day by day. Similarly, under the leadership and assistance of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the mutual suspicion and complaints formed in the past among all aspects of Tibet have gradually been eliminated, and everyone is united in building a new Tibet.

Next, Living Buddha Chijiang reviewed the preparations for the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and then said: From the current situation, the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is not only timely but also necessary. The unity of all parties has been consolidated. At the same time, the work of all parties has developed. On this basis, the Preparatory Committee will uniformly lead the personnel of all parties to carry out work together, further strengthen the unity within Tibet, formally establish a unified Tibet Autonomous Region, enable Tibet to get rid of all aspects of backwardness, catch up with the advanced fraternal nationalities, and transition to a socialist society with them, which is completely in line with the long-term interests of all the Tibetan people.

Recently, news has spread here that neighboring provinces are carrying out or preparing for reforms through peaceful consultation, which has caused some people's concerns and fears. Rumors are spreading that after the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, Tibet will undergo reforms. These alarms are mainly caused by a lack of understanding of the situation, because our current motherland is carrying out socialist construction in full swing, and all fraternal nationalities across the country are advancing on the broad road of socialism. The so-called socialism is a truly happy and fulfilling society, and we Tibetans have no other way to go except the road of socialism. We must gradually carry out reforms. But when to reform? How to reform? This depends on the development of the work and the situation in all aspects; at the same time, it must be discussed and carried out according to the wishes of the relevant leaders and the broad masses of the people themselves, rather than being forced and monopolized by others. Chairman Mao has given clear instructions on this point in his talks with the tribute delegations and visiting groups. In 1954, when the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni went to Beijing to meet Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao repeatedly told us that reforms must be done slowly and not be impatient. At the same time, he explicitly told Suokang Wangqing Geller and Lhalu Tsewang Dorje and others from last year's visiting group that the purpose of reform is to improve everyone's lives, not to make them worse, so there is no need to worry or fear reform. We should now unite and work hard to do a good job in the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region and continue to advance Tibet's work. So that at an appropriate time, reforms can be carried out through peaceful consultation, on the basis of not hindering unity, and in accordance with the will of the majority of the people.

Living Buddha Chijiang emphasized in his speech: In terms of religion, the Constitution specifically stipulates the article on freedom of religious belief. At the same time, Chairman Mao also explicitly instructed: The Communist Party adopts a policy of protecting religion, and protects those who believe in religion and those who do not believe in religion, as well as those who believe in this religion and those who believe in other religions, and respects their beliefs; religion is protected today and will continue to be protected in the future. The basic issue of the restoration and development of religion is completely different from political reform. At the same time, everyone also knows that without political development, the development of religion is also impossible, so there is no need for unfounded suspicion and fear. I hope that everyone will always cherish Buddhism, the source of happiness, and especially the monks, as long as they are sincere and devout, worries and fears are unnecessary. Everyone should carry out all religious activities as usual and better.

All our staff members, based on the spirit of unity and mutual assistance, should study hard, strengthen unity, and unite all the monks and lay people in Tibet, be vigilant at all times against the imperialist plots of sabotage and sabotage, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, and with the help of the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC and the Tibet Military Region, strive to develop various construction undertakings in Tibet and strive to realize regional autonomy in Tibet at an early date.

    团结一致建设西藏
　　（达赖喇嘛代表赤江·罗桑益西活佛在拉萨市庆祝西藏自治区筹委会成立大会上的讲话摘要）
    赤江活佛首先指出：在中国共产党，中央人民政府和伟大的领袖毛主席的正确领导下，西藏自治区筹备委员会正式成立了。这是中国共产党政策的光辉成就。它不仅表现了西藏内部进一步的团结起来，而且标志着祖国各兄弟民族人民间的团结合作日趋巩固和发展。这是西藏人民政治生活中具有重大历史意义的空前的伟大事业。这不但是西藏人民而且也是祖国各族人民都应欢欣鼓舞的。
    在西藏自治区筹备委员会成立的时候，以陈副总理为首的中央代表团前来祝贺，对此我们以无限兴奋的心情表示衷心感谢；同时，要求代表们给予我们更多宝贵的指示和帮助。
    赤江活佛接着详细地讲到西藏和平解放前后的历史情况和生活对比。他说，几年来，由于进藏人民解放军和西藏全体僧俗人民的共同努力，我们在实现协议的工作中，取得了很大的成就。
    赤江活佛说：西藏是喇嘛教的中心地区，全体人民对喇嘛教都有着很高的信仰，人民对宗教信仰如同生命一样的重视和保护着。几年来，由于进藏人民解放军和工作人员遵守了宗教信仰自由政策，保护了喇嘛寺庙，尊重人民的信仰，汉藏民族人民兄弟般的友爱合作日益发展和加强了起来。同样的，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导和帮助下，西藏内部各方面由于过去历代形成的互相猜疑、彼此埋怨，逐渐消除，大家团结一致的建设着新西藏。
    接着，赤江活佛回顾了一下成立西藏自治区筹备委员会的筹备经过，然后说道：从现在情况看来，西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，不仅是适时的，而且是必要的。各方面已经巩固的团结起来了。同时，各方面的工作均有发展。在这一基础上，筹委会统一领导各方面的人员，共同进行工作，进一步做好西藏内部的团结，为正式成立统一西藏自治区，使西藏能够摆脱各方面的落后情况，赶上先进的兄弟民族，和他们一道过渡到社会主义社会，是完全符合西藏全体人民的长远利益的。
    最近，邻居各省用和平协商的方式，正在进行或准备进行改革的消息传到了这里，引起了若干人的疑虑和恐惧，谣传西藏自治区筹备委员会成立以后，西藏就要进行改革。这些惊动主要是不了解情况所致，因为我们现在的祖国正在轰轰烈烈地进行着社会主义建设，全国各兄弟民族正在向社会主义的康庄大道上前进着。所谓社会主义，是真正幸福美满的社会，我们西藏除了走社会主义的道路以外，别无其他道路。我们必须逐步进行改革。但是什么时候改革？如何改革？这还得看工作发展和各方面的情况；同时要根据有关领导人物和广大人民自己的意愿，商量进行，而不是由别人强迫包办。这点在毛主席历次给致敬团、参观团的谈话中，都有明确的指示。1954年达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼去北京拜见毛主席时，毛主席再三叮嘱我们改革必须慢慢的来，不能性急，同时还明确告诉过索康·旺清格勒，以及去年参观团的拉鲁·策旺多吉等人，改革是要把大家的生活改好，而不是改坏，所以对改革的顾虑和惧怕是不必要的。我们现在应该团结一致，积极努力地把西藏自治区筹备委员会的工作做好，把西藏的工作不断地向前推进。以便在适当的时机通过和平协商的方式，在不妨碍团结的基础上，按照多数人民的意志来进行改革。
    赤江活佛在讲话中强调指出：在宗教方面，宪法中特别规定了宗教信仰自由的条文。同时，毛主席也明确指示：共产党对宗教采取保护政策，对信仰宗教的和不信宗教的人，以及信这种宗教和信别种宗教的人，一律保护，并尊重他们的信仰；对宗教今天保护，将来仍然保护。宗教的恢复与发展的基本问题，它与政治的改革完全是两回事。同时大家也知道，政治不能发展，宗教的发展也是不可能的，因此不需要毫无根据的怀疑和恐惧。希望大家把一些幸福的根源——佛教，始终如一的加以爱护，特别是僧侣，只要笃诚的虔信，顾虑和疑惧都是不必要的。大家应该照常更好的进行一切宗教活动。
    我们所有的工作人员，一本团结互助的精神，努力学习、加强团结，并团结全西藏僧俗人民，时刻警惕帝国主义挑拨破坏阴谋，在中国共产党、毛主席和国务院的领导下、在中共西藏工委和西藏军区的帮助下，为发展西藏的各项建设事业、为争取早日在西藏实行区域自治而奋斗。
