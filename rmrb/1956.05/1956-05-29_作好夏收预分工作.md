    Do a Good Job in the Summer Harvest Pre-Distribution Work

    This year's summer harvest crops are growing well. After the basic realization of agricultural collectivization nationwide, the broad masses of farmers are joyfully welcoming the first bumper harvest. Now, how to distribute the harvest has become the most concerning issue for the members. They are wondering: Now that the cooperative has a bumper harvest, will I be able to increase my income?

    After the fundamental change in the relations of production, people with different economic conditions will consider what material benefits they can get in the new economic organization. In a cooperative with completely socialist characteristics, the principle of distribution according to work should be implemented. Everyone knows this principle. However, the vast majority of members have not yet experienced a distribution, and they are not clear about what the distribution will look like. Members with strong labor power and high work points are afraid that the principle of distribution according to work will not be thoroughly implemented, saying: "If more work doesn't mean more pay, what kind of socialism is that!" Members with weak labor power and few work points hope that the cooperative can take care of them, saying: "Now that the means of production are publicly owned, can the cooperative not care about the members' livelihood needs?" Some elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed members who lack labor power are even more concerned about whether they can be taken care of. Members with different economic situations have a common concern, fearing that the cooperative will retain too much of the harvest, resulting in "increased production not enough to make up for the deficit" and "little left after various deductions."

    The members' various thoughts on the issue of distribution fully reflect the very complex situation in the cooperatives. Most of the advanced cooperatives were formed by merging and upgrading primary cooperatives around the winter planting season last year, and many individual farmers directly joined the advanced cooperatives. A cooperative cadre in Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, said: "Large cooperative nested with small cooperative, new cooperative nested with old cooperative, cooperative nested with individual households." This is very true. Many cooperatives did not thoroughly solve the problems of work point conversion and investment clearing during the process of merging and upgrading. After many advanced cooperatives were established, their management was poor, and non-production expenditures or non-urgent production investments were too high, resulting in "significant increase in production but not much profit." Under these circumstances, how to ensure that members receive appropriate income has become a very important and complex issue in this year's summer distribution.

    Some rural workers and cooperative cadres deeply felt the lack of funds in the first half of the year's production, so they wanted to come up with ideas in the summer harvest to retain more for the cooperative. However, most of the advanced cooperatives have not been established for a year, and the harvest this summer season is unlikely to increase much compared to previous years. If too much is deducted, the members' income will inevitably decrease; and those who work the most and best will be the ones who are reduced the most. This is not in line with the principle of distribution according to work. Therefore, appropriately implementing the method of "less deduction and more distribution" (less retaining of production expenses, public accumulation fund, and public welfare fund, and more distribution to members) in this first distribution has become a key to taking care of the demands of the majority of members.

    How to achieve "less deduction and more distribution," ensuring that members receive considerable income while ensuring that the cooperative can develop production? Cooperatives in many regions have provided successful experiences. This is to implement trial calculation and pre-distribution in accordance with the spirit of "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily," reduce the cooperative's expenses, and open up various ways to increase production. When the Jinxing Cooperative in Sanlidian, Daming County, Hebei, initially formulated the pre-distribution plan, various deductions accounted for 49% of the estimated total income of wheat, and the members' income would be greatly reduced. The resident staff and the Party's township general branch committee discovered this situation, organized the cooperative cadres to study the "Run the Cooperative Diligently and Thriftily" instructions, criticized the "broad retention and narrow use" mentality, and used various methods to reduce the amount of deductions. They prepared to mobilize members to cut grass to be used as feed for draft animals. This alone saved 10,000 catties of wheat that were intended to be retained to buy feed. Together with other methods, the income of more than 90% of the members was increased.

    In cooperatives with completely socialist characteristics, more work should lead to more pay. This is an unwavering principle of distribution. However, in some cooperatives, the labor days of some members are too few, which is caused by certain shortcomings in the leadership. For example, the labor organization of some cooperatives is unreasonable, and the labor days obtained by many members with similar labor power are very disparate; the standards for calculating work points between teams in some cooperatives are inconsistent, and members receive very different work points for the same labor; the labor days invested by members in capital construction and voluntary labor are very unbalanced in some cooperatives; and so on. In addition, some cooperatives have complex organizations, too many management personnel, and recorded many non-labor work points; some cooperatives have not done a good job in setting labor quotas, and the remuneration standards are unreasonable, with the same work points recorded for both light and heavy labor, which puts members who work more and better at a disadvantage. These problems must be properly resolved; otherwise, there will be no real distribution according to work. In the pre-distribution process, Sima No. 1 Cooperative in Xingyang County, Henan Province, carefully verified the members' labor work points, cleared the work accounts, corrected the unreasonable phenomenon of recording work points, appropriately determined the work point subsidies for the cooperative's management personnel, and created good conditions for correctly implementing distribution according to work.

    In some cooperatives, the cooperative cadres only considered that the lives of a small number of members were still difficult and, on the pretext that the summer harvest distribution was still a pre-distribution, adopted the egalitarian practice of "distribution by head count," which is completely wrong. Some members were forced to go out to make a living due to financial difficulties, resulting in fewer labor days in the cooperative, so that "if you can't catch up one step, you can't catch up step by step"; some members also reduced their labor days due to special reasons such as disasters and illnesses. They are indeed in difficulty. It is necessary to provide appropriate adjustments and care for these members with special difficulties (such as pre-borrowing some labor days, etc.), but the principle of distribution according to work must not be harmed because of this. Some cooperative cadres said that distribution should "not strike at the models (referring to those who work actively) and not give advantage to the lazy." This spirit is completely correct.

    Judging from the situation of pre-distribution experiments in various places, in this complex distribution work that is related to the vital interests of every member, in-depth political and ideological work must be done well. It is necessary to make the members fully understand the pre-distribution policy, fully understand the relationship between individual interests and collective interests, calculate small accounts and also calculate large accounts, look at the present and also look at the future, in order to resolve contradictions in all aspects. The Wuxing Cooperative in Xili Township, Fuzhou City Suburbs, Fujian Province, was formed by merging eighteen primary cooperatives during the winter planting last year; the wheat of two cooperatives was planted by the members separately. At the time of the merger, everyone was very enthusiastic and agreed to unified distribution: "Everyone is taking the socialist road, why bother calculating every little bit?" However, many people are now looking at the wheat growing really well and are starting to grumble: "It's best for whoever planted it to harvest it." This cooperative carried out in-depth persuasion and education, reasonably compensated these people's investment and labor, and finally everyone unanimously agreed to unified distribution. After the drastic change in the relations of production, the thinking of farmers is not easy to completely stabilize immediately. The members who originally owned more and better land, they see a scene of bumper harvest, and they are both happy and worried. Cooperatives must take appropriate measures to make everyone happy and no one worried. Implementing unified distribution of summer harvest crops is of course more beneficial to the entire cooperative. However, for different situations, different treatment methods should be adopted; after persuasion is ineffective, it is necessary to respect the wishes of these members.

    Summer harvest distribution must be carried out in busy agricultural activities. Some people are afraid that spending effort on distribution may delay production, so they are thinking of doing it hastily. They should understand that production depends on people's enthusiasm, and doing a good job in the summer harvest pre-distribution is an important way to stimulate the labor enthusiasm of members at present. The experience of the Mazhan Township Cooperative in Lanxi County, Zhejiang Province, after budget trial distribution, the members' concerns were eliminated, their enthusiasm was high, and the labor attendance rate immediately increased from the original 20% to 80%, is a very realistic example. Every rural worker must clarify the relationship between distribution and production, properly arrange distribution and production, and make the summer harvest pre-distribution work a powerful driving force for mobilizing members to strive for increased production this year.

### 作好夏收预分工作

    作好夏收预分工作
    今年夏收作物生长良好，全国基本上实现农业合作化以后，广大农民欢欣鼓舞地迎接第一个丰收。现在，收获物如何分配，已成为社员们最关心的问题。他们想：合作社丰收了，我能不能增加收入呢？
    在生产关系发生根本变化以后，经济条件各不相同的人都会考虑自己在新的经济组织中可能得到什么物质利益。在完全社会主义性质的合作社中，应该实行按劳取酬的分配原则，这个道理大家是知道的。但是，绝大多数社员还没有经过一次分配，他们还不清楚究竟会分配成什么样子。劳动力强、得工分多的社员，唯恐按劳取酬的原则不能贯彻执行，说：“要是多劳不能多得，还叫什么社会主义！”劳动力弱、得工分少的社员，希望合作社能够加以照顾，说：“生产资料都公有了，社员的生活需要，社里还能不管？”某些老弱孤寡缺乏劳力的社员，对自己能否得到照顾更是关心。经济情况各不相同的社员，又有一个共同的顾虑，害怕合作社扣留的收获物太多，弄得“增产不够补窟窿”，“七折八扣剩不了多少”。
    社员在分配问题上的各种各样的思想，充分反映了合作社中十分复杂的情况。多数高级社是在去年冬种前后由初级社合并、升级而成的，个体农民直接参加高级社的也很多。江苏省江宁县一个合作社干部说：“大社套小社，新社套老社，社套单干户。”这话真是不错。有不少合作社在合并、升级的过程中，并没有彻底地解决工分的折算，投资的清理等等问题。许多高级社建成以后，经营管理不善，非生产的开支或非急需的生产投资过多，以致“增产不少，获利不大”。在这种情况下，如何保证社员得到适当的收入，就成为今年夏季分配中一个十分重要而又十分复杂的问题。
    有些农村工作人员和合作社干部在上半年生产中深感资金缺乏之苦，于是就想在夏收收获物中打些主意，给合作社多留一些。可是多数高级社成立起来还不够一年，今年夏收季节，收获还不可能比往年增加很多，如果扣的多了，社员的收入势必减少；而减少得最多的，又将是那些劳动得又多又好的社员。这是不符合按劳取酬原则的。因此，在这第一次分配中适当地实行“少扣多分”（少扣留生产费用、公积金、公益金，多分配给社员）的办法，就成为照顾多数社员的要求的一个关键。
    如何做到“少扣多分”，既保证社员得到相当的收入，又保证合作社能发展生产？不少地区的合作社已经提供了成功的经验。这就是，按照“勤俭办社”的精神实行试算预分，紧缩合作社的开支，开辟多种增产门路。河北大名县三里店金星社最初制定预分方案的时候，各项扣除占小麦预计总收入的49％，社员的收入将大大减少。驻社工作人员和党的乡总支委员会发现了这种情形，组织社干部学习了“勤俭办社”指示，批判了“宽留窄用”思想，用各种办法减少扣除的数量。他们准备发动社员割草，充作耕畜的饲料。只这一项，就节省了打算留下买饲草的一万斤小麦。加上其他办法，使90％以上的社员增加了收入。
    在完全社会主义性质的合作社中，多劳应当多得，这是坚定不移的分配原则。但是，有些合作社中部分社员的劳动日太少，是由于领导方面的某些缺点造成的。例如，有些合作社的劳动组织不合理，许多劳力相当的社员得到的劳动日却很悬殊；有些合作社的队与队之间计算工分的标准不一致，社员进行同样的劳动，得到的工分却差别很大；有些合作社的社员在基本建设和义务劳动上，投入的劳动日很不平衡，等等。另外，有些合作社机构庞杂，管理人员太多，记了许多非劳动工分；有些合作社劳动定额没有作好，报酬标准不合理，轻重劳动记一样工分，使劳动得又多又好的社员吃了亏。这些问题都必须妥当地加以解决，否则，那就谈不到真正的按劳取酬。河南荥阳县司马一社在预分过程中，认真核对社员的劳动工分，清理工账，纠正记工不合理的现象，适当地确定社的管理人员的工分补贴，给正确地贯彻实行按劳分配创造了良好的条件。
    在某些合作社中，社干部仅仅考虑到少部分社员的生活还有困难，借口夏收分配还是预分，采取“按人头分配”的平均主义作法，这是完全不对的。有些社员由于生活困难，被迫外出谋生，在社里得的劳动日少，以致“一步赶不上，步步赶不上”；有些社员由于灾病等等特殊原因，也减少了劳动日。他们确实是困难的。对这些有特殊困难的社员，给以适当的调剂和照顾（如预借一部分劳动日等）是必要的，但决不能因此损害了按劳取酬的原则。有些合作社干部说，分配要作到“不打击模范（指积极劳动的人），不便宜懒汉”。这个精神完全正确。　　从各地进行预分试验的情况看来，在这个关系每一个社员切身利益的复杂的分配工作中，必须作好深入的政治思想工作。一定要让社员完全懂得预分政策，完全了解个人利益和集体利益的关系，算小账也算大账，看眼前又看将来，以便解决各方面的矛盾。福建福州市郊溪里乡五星合作社在去年冬种时候由十八个初级社合并而成；有两个社的麦子是社员分散自种的。在并社时候，大家热情很高，都同意统一分配：“大家走社会主义道路，何必一星一点地计较？”但是，许多人现在看着麦子长的真好，就嘀咕起来了：“最好谁种谁收”。这个社进行深入的说服教育，合理地补偿了这些人的投资、用工，最后大家一致同意统一分配。在生产关系激烈变革之后，农民的思想不容易马上完全稳定。原来占有土地较多较好的社员，他们看见一片丰收景象，心里又喜又愁。合作社一定要采取适当的办法，使大家都欢喜，没有一个人发愁。实行夏收作物的统一分配，对于全社来说，当然是比较有利的。但是，对于不同的情况，还要采用不同的对待办法；在说服无效以后，尊重这些社员的意愿，是必要的。
    夏收分配要在繁忙的农事活动中进行。有些人害怕在分配上用了功夫，可能耽误生产，因此想着草草了事。他们应该了解，生产是靠人的积极性干起来的，作好夏收预分，正是当前激发社员劳动积极性的重要办法。浙江兰溪县马占乡合作社经过预算试分，社员的顾虑消除，情绪高涨，劳动出勤率立刻从原来的20％提高到80％，就是很现实的例子。每一个农村工作人员都要弄清分配和生产的关系，把分配和生产妥善地加以安排，使夏收预分工作成为发动社员争取今年增产的强大动力。
