　　Shenyang City's eighteen state-owned factories with new product trial production tasks originally planned to trial-produce sixty-nine new products in the first quarter but actually trial-produced eighty kinds.

　　Among the new products produced, there is the Soviet-style 6AM type twelve-slot flotation machine for Anshan Iron and Steel's ore dressing, the 2BY28 large mine axial fan for ventilation in large mines, and the 15,000 kVA large water-cooled electric furnace transformer for melting high-quality steel in forty-ton electric furnaces, as well as paints used in precision instruments, transportation tools, and heavy machinery.

　　Factories that completed the new product trial production tasks relatively well include the Shenyang Water Pump Factory, the Shenyang Fan Factory, the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, and the Shenyang Paint Factory. In previous years, Shenyang City's new product trial production plan for the first quarter was not completed well, but this year this situation has basically changed.

　　沈阳制成八十种工业新产品
    沈阳市十八个有新产品试制任务的国营工厂，第一季度计划试制新产品六十九种，实际试制成了八十种。
    制成的新产品中，有供鞍钢选矿用的苏式6AM型十二槽浮选机，有供大型矿井通风用的2BY28号大型矿井轴流扇风机，有供四十吨电炉熔炼优质钢用的一万五千千伏安的大型水冷式电炉变压器，还有在精密仪器、交通工具、重型机器上用的油漆等。
    完成新产品试制任务较好的工厂，有沈阳水泵厂、沈阳扇风机厂、沈阳风动工具厂、沈阳油漆厂等单位。沈阳市历年来第一季度新产品试制计划都完成得不好，今年基本上改变了这种情况。  （本报驻沈阳记者）
