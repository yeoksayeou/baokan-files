Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 5th: The North Atlantic Group Council meeting opened on May 4th at the Palais de Chaillot in Paris, with the foreign ministers of all member countries of the group participating.

According to Parisian newspapers, the question before this meeting is: how to prevent the North Atlantic Group from "disintegrating" and enable it to "continue to exist" in the face of significant changes in the international situation? Opinions among the member states on this issue are divided.

The meeting was held in secret. According to foreign news agencies, at the opening meeting in the morning, NATO Secretary-General Ismay gave a brief report summarizing the work. Then, the meeting began to discuss the international situation.

British Foreign Secretary Lloyd was the first to speak, reporting on the results of Bulganin and Khrushchev's visit to Britain. Danish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hansen also reported on his impressions of his visit to the Soviet Union.

From the disclosed information, it can be seen that the speeches of the foreign ministers of several countries at this meeting differed from the usual keynote speeches advocating the expansion of armaments at past meetings. Representatives of many countries spoke of strengthening "Western economic and political cooperation." Representatives of Western European countries, who were uneasy about the heavy burden of armaments, particularly emphasized this point.

French Foreign Minister Pineau presented a plan to the Council. This plan calls for the establishment of a special agency to study peaceful economic development issues.

In his speech, US Secretary of State Dulles called for "unity" among the members of the North Atlantic Group. He talked about "expanding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization beyond purely military matters," while still emphasizing that Western countries cannot "relax their defenses."

At the afternoon meeting, the participants turned to discuss the issue of "NATO's non-military activities." Sources say that representatives from the United States, Canada, Italy, West Germany, and other countries have put forward their respective proposals.

    北大西洋集团理事会第一天会议
　　若干发言者强调经济政治合作
    新华社5日讯　巴黎消息：北大西洋集团理事会会议五月四日在巴黎夏乐宫开幕，这个集团各成员国的外交部长参加了这次会议。
    据巴黎报纸指出，摆在这次会议面前的问题是：如何在国际局势已经发生显著变化的情况下，使北大西洋集团不致“瓦解”，能够“继续存在下去”。各成员国间在这个问题上的意见是分歧的。
    会议是秘密进行的。据外国通讯社透露，在上午开幕会议上，北大西洋公约组织秘书长伊斯迈作了简短的工作总结报告。然后，会议就开始讨论国际局势。
    英国外交大臣劳埃德第一个发言，他报告了布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访问英国的结果。丹麦首相兼外交大臣汉森也报告了他访问苏联的印象。
    从透露出来的消息里可以看到，若干国家外交部长在这次会议上的发言，同过去会议上照例鼓吹扩张军备的发言主调有所不同。许多国家代表谈到要加强“西方的经济和政治合作”。对沉重的军备负担感到不安的西欧国家代表特别强调这一点。
    法国外交部长比诺向理事会提出了一个计划。这个计划要求建立一个研究和平经济发展问题的专门机构。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在发言中呼吁北大西洋集团成员国间的“团结”。他谈到要把北大西洋公约组织“扩大到纯军事以外”，同时他依然强调西方国家不能“放松防务”。
    下午会议上，会议参加者转入讨论关于“北大西洋公约组织展开在非军事方面的活动”的问题。有消息说，美国、加拿大、意大利、西德等国的代表都提出了各自的建议。
