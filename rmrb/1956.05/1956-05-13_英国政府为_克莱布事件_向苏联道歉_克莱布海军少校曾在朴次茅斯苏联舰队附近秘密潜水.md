Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 12th: TASS reported on May 12th that the British government apologized to the Soviet government for the "Crabb Affair." During the visit of Soviet leaders Bulganin and Khrushchev to Britain, a diver of unknown origin was discovered near the Soviet fleet berthed at the British naval base in Portsmouth. The Soviet Embassy in Britain sent a note to the British government regarding this matter on May 4th. The British government replied to the Soviet Embassy on May 9th, acknowledging that this incident had occurred and apologizing to the Soviet government for it.

In its note to the British government, the Soviet Embassy stated that on April 19th, at 7:30 AM, while the Soviet fleet was berthed in Portsmouth, sailors on Soviet warships discovered a diver swimming between Soviet destroyers. He remained on the surface for a minute or two before diving into the water again near the destroyer "Lookout."

The note stated that the commander of the Soviet fleet, Rear Admiral Kotov, had brought this matter to the attention of Rear Admiral Bennett, Chief of Staff of the Portsmouth Naval Base, during a conversation. Rear Admiral Bennett categorically denied the possibility of a diver appearing near the Soviet fleet and stated that no diving work was being conducted in the harbor at that time. However, news in the British newspapers on April 30th confirmed that the British Admiralty had indeed conducted secret diving experiments in the area where the Soviet fleet was berthed in Portsmouth. Moreover, these experimental activities resulted in the death of a British diver.

The Soviet Embassy considers the conduct of secret diving experiments around the Soviet fleet during its visit to Portsmouth to be a noteworthy and unusual event and hopes that the British Foreign Office can provide an explanation on this matter.

The British Foreign Office's reply to the Soviet Embassy stated that, as publicly reported, Commander Crabb had conducted diving experiments and was reportedly killed while conducting them.

The British reply stated: The diver mentioned in the Soviet note as having been discovered among the Soviet destroyers was probably Commander Crabb. He did not have any permission to swim near the destroyers. Her Majesty's Government expresses its regret for this incident.

Xinhua News Agency, London, May 12th: British newspapers are carrying much discussion about the matter of British naval diving expert Crabb diving near the Soviet fleet berthed in Portsmouth while it was carrying Bulganin and Khrushchev on their visit to Britain.

An editorial in "The Times" emphasized: "Official silence cannot save the Admiralty and the intelligence service from criticism. Obviously, the diving was ordered... British public opinion at home and abroad will inevitably conclude that this decision was taken to take advantage of Bulganin and Khrushchev's visit to secretly conduct detailed underwater observation of the Soviet cruisers... Attempting to engage in espionage and adopting this approach at such a moment can only be regarded as unreasonably undermining the atmosphere of cordial reception and being brazenly rude."

"The Daily Mail" demanded in a headline editorial that those responsible for Crabb's actions be relieved of their duties.

London Radio reported that the House of Commons will debate the "Crabb Affair" next Monday. It is expected that the Labour Party will express disagreement with the government's approach.

    英国政府为“克莱布事件”向苏联道歉
    克莱布海军少校曾在朴次茅斯苏联舰队附近秘密潜水
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科12日讯：苏联领导人布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访问英国时乘坐的苏联舰队，在英国海军基地朴次茅斯停泊期间，在舰队附近曾经发现一个来历不明的潜水员，苏联驻英国大使馆在五月四日就这件事照会英国政府。英国政府在五月九日复照苏联驻英国大使馆，承认曾发生过这件事情，并且就这件事向苏联政府道歉。
    苏联大使馆在给英国政府的照会里说，在苏联舰队停泊朴次茅斯期间，四月十九日七点三十分，苏联军舰的水兵发现一名潜水员在苏联驱逐舰之间游动。他在水面上停留一两分钟就又在“了望号”驱逐舰的附近潜入水中。
    照会说，苏联舰队指挥官海军少将科托夫同朴次茅斯海军基地参谋长海军少将贝内特谈话时曾经提请注意这件事。贝内特少将断然否认潜水员在苏联舰队旁边出现的可能性，并且说，在这个时候港口里并没有进行任何潜水工作。可是，今年四月三十日英国报纸的消息却证实了英国海军司令部在朴次茅斯苏联舰队停泊区确实进行了秘密的潜水试验。而且，这种试验活动的进行造成一名英国潜水员的死亡。
    苏联大使馆认为，当苏联舰队在朴次茅斯进行访问期间在它们周围进行秘密潜水试验，是一件值得重视的不寻常的事情，希望英国外交部能对这个问题有所说明。
    英国外交部给苏联大使馆的复照说，如公开报道的，海军少校克莱布进行了潜水试验，并且，据说他在进行试验的时候死亡了。
    英国的复照说：苏联照会里所说在苏联驱逐舰中间发现的那一名潜水员大概就是海军少校克莱布。他在驱逐舰附近游动并没有得到任何许可。女王政府谨对这个事件表示歉意。
    新华社据塔斯社伦敦12日讯　英国海军潜水专家克莱布在载送布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访问英国的苏联舰队停泊朴次茅斯期间在舰队附近潜水一事，在英国报纸中间引起了许多议论。
    “泰晤士报”的社论强调指出：“官方的沉默并不能挽救海军部和情报处免受批评。显然，潜水是受命进行的……英国国内和国外必然会得出这样的结论：采取这种决定是为了利用布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫的访问来对苏联巡洋舰秘密地进行详细的水下观察……在这种时刻企图从事间谍活动和采取这种方法，只能被认为是毫无道理地破坏殷勤接待的气氛和放肆粗暴的表现。”
    “每日简报”在一篇大字标题的社论中要求免除那些对克莱布的行动应当负责的人的职务。
    伦敦电台报道，下院将在下星期一辩论“克莱布事件”。预料工党将表示不同意政府这种做法。
