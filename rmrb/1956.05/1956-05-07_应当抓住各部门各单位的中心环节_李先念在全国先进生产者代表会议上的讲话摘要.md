　　We Should Grasp the Central Link of All Departments and Units
　　Excerpts from Li Xiannian's Speech at the National Conference of Advanced Producers Representatives

When Li Xiannian, Director of the Fifth Office of the State Council, spoke at the National Conference of Advanced Producers Representatives on the 5th, he pointed out that promoting advanced experiences in all aspects and carrying out the advanced producer movement should grasp the central link of all departments and units.

Li Xiannian said that the work of each department and each unit within the department can effectively promote the accelerated realization of China's socialist industrialization and continuously meet the material and cultural needs of the people only by revolving around the central link, cooperating with each other, and forming an organic whole.

Li Xiannian's speech started from the tasks and functions of national financial and trade work. He said that the financial and trade departments bear arduous tasks in developing China's national economy. In terms of financial and monetary work, our task is to have reasonable income and appropriate use, and to earnestly guarantee the growth of the people's material interests and the development of the national economy on a possible basis; in terms of trade work, we undertake almost the entire task of social commodity circulation. If financial and trade work is done well, it will promote the development of the entire national economy and consolidate the alliance between the working class and the peasants; otherwise, it will affect the food, clothing, and use of 600 million people, and even affect all aspects of socialist economic construction. To complete the state's financial and trade tasks, we must rely on the efforts of all financial and trade workers, and even more on the joint efforts of the entire working class, peasants, and the people of the whole country. Because financial and trade work can only have a broad path on the basis of the development of industrial and agricultural production. What is particularly important here is to continuously create, discover, and promote advanced experiences in production and work, and to cultivate a large number of advanced producers and advanced workers.

Li Xiannian explained in detail the specific issues related to promoting advanced experiences and carrying out the advanced producer movement. He said that in practical work, we should not only focus on promoting large-scale, complete sets of advanced experiences, but also not neglect even small, piecemeal advanced experiences. The responsibility of leaders lies in continuously summarizing and promoting the advanced experiences created by the broad masses of employees, which are not complete at the beginning, so that more people can continue to create and enrich them through practice, and gradually improve them to a systematic scientific level. Only by starting from the smallest details and paying attention to discovering even those experiences and creations that can save the country a needle and a thread, can we fully mobilize the employees, so that they all have the opportunity to contribute a little bit of strength to socialism; and only by turning advanced experiences into the universal actions of the broad masses of employees can we generate huge material strength, and complete the first five-year plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the target with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Li Xiannian said that carrying out socialist competition and the advanced producer movement must also be accompanied by the establishment of a set of responsibility systems and advanced and realistic quota systems. After the masses are fully mobilized, it is also necessary to implement the reward and punishment system and carry out criticism and self-criticism well. Only when right and wrong are clear can advanced units and individuals continue to move forward, can general units and individuals quickly reach advanced levels, and can backward units and individuals strive to catch up with advanced levels; and individual backward units and individuals who receive necessary criticism and accusations will also educate and encourage all employees. Of course, the methods adopted by some units to simply take administrative penalties, or even arbitrarily dismiss people with problems in certain jobs, instead of patiently helping them, should also be criticized.

When talking about the tasks and roles of advanced producers, Li Xiannian said that there must be a group of backbones between leaders and the masses to play an exemplary leading role and a bridging role. Advanced producers and advanced workers are such backbone forces. On the one hand, advanced producers and advanced workers must reflect their own experiences and the opinions of the masses to the leaders; on the other hand, they must convey the correct decisions and instructions of the leaders to the masses, and work with the masses to realize the tasks assigned by the state and the people.

Li Xiannian pointed out that this matter is not easy. Some leaders analyze and make decisions after accepting your suggestions, and then implement them; but there are also a few leaders who do not take an enthusiastic attitude towards your suggestions, and even treat you with a negative attitude and resistance. Therefore, it is very necessary to fight against all kinds of right-leaning conservative ideas and bureaucratic work styles.

Li Xiannian particularly pointed out in his speech that advanced producers and advanced workers must have a humble and simple style, strive to overcome arrogance and complacency, strengthen learning, improve their awareness, must maintain close ties with the masses of employees, learn from everyone who has strengths, and patiently impart their advanced experiences to everyone.

The last part of Li Xiannian's speech was about caring for the lives and welfare of employees. He said that in mobilizing the broad masses of employees to invest in the cause of socialist construction, in addition to caring for them politically and ideologically, we must also care for them in terms of material welfare. In the past few years, our party and government have done a lot of work for the broad masses of employees politically, economically, and materially, but we also have some shortcomings in wage issues. These shortcomings are mainly manifested in the fact that the rate of increase in employee wages in the past two years is not commensurate with the rate of development of the national economy and the increase in labor productivity. He said that the Party Central Committee and the State Council have pointed out these shortcomings and errors to relevant parties, and decided to appropriately increase employee wages starting from the second quarter of this year. As long as we combine the political awareness and material interests of the employees, the labor enthusiasm of the employees can be sustained and consolidated.

### 应当抓住各部门各单位的中心环节  李先念在全国先进生产者代表会议上的讲话摘要

　　应当抓住各部门各单位的中心环节
　　李先念在全国先进生产者代表会议上的讲话摘要
    国务院第五办公室主任李先念五日在全国先进生产者代表会议上讲话的时候指出：推广各方面的先进经验和开展先进生产者运动，应当抓住各部门各单位的中心环节。
    李先念说：各个部门以及部门内部的各个单位的工作，只有围绕着中心环节，互相协同，形成一个有机的整体，才能有效地促使我国社会主义工业化的加速实现和不断满足人民的物质文化生活的需要。
    李先念的讲话是从国家财政贸易工作的任务和作用方面讲起的。他说，财政贸易部门在发展我国国民经济中担负着艰巨的任务。在财政金融工作方面，我们的任务是要收入合理，使用得当，要在可能的基础上切实保障人民物质利益的增长和国民经济的发展；在贸易工作方面，我们担负着几乎整个社会商品流转任务。财政贸易工作做好了，就能促进整个国民经济的发展，巩固工人阶级同农民的联盟；反之，就要影响六亿人民的吃、穿、用，以至影响社会主义经济建设的各方面。完成国家的财政贸易任务，要靠全体财政贸易工作者的努力，更要靠全体工人阶级、农民和全国人民的共同努力。因为只有在工农业生产发展的基础上，财政贸易工作才有广阔的道路。这里特别重要的是，要在生产和工作中不断地创造、发现和推广先进经验，大量地培养先进生产者和先进工作者。
    李先念详细讲述了有关推广先进经验和开展先进生产者运动中的具体问题。他说在实际工作中，不但要抓紧推广大的、成套的先进经验，同时也不能忽视那怕是小的、零碎的先进经验。领导者的责任，就是在于把广大职工群众创造出来的、开始并不完整的先进经验，不断加以总结推广，让更多的群众从实践中继续创造、丰富，使它逐步提高到系统的科学的水平。只有从点滴着手，注意发掘那些那怕是只能够为国家节省一针一线的经验和创造，我们才能全面发动职工群众，使他们都有为社会主义多贡献一点力量的机会；也只有把先进经验变成为广大职工群众的普遍行动，才能产生巨大的物质力量，才能又多又快又好又省地提前和超额完成第一个五年计划。
    李先念说，开展社会主义竞赛和开展先进生产者运动，还必须相应地建立一套责任制度和先进而又符合实际情况的定额制度。在群众充分发动以后，也必须很好地贯彻、实行奖惩制度和开展批评和自我批评。只有是非分明，才能使先进的单位和个人继续前进，使一般的单位和个人迅速达到先进水平，使落后的单位和个人努力赶上先进水平；而个别落后的单位和个人受到必要的批评和指责，也会使全体职工受到教育和鼓励。当然，有些单位所采取的对某些工作有毛病的人，不是耐心帮助，而只简单地采取行政处罚，甚至随便开除的惩办主义方法，也是应该加以批判的。
    当谈到先进生产者的任务和作用的时候，李先念说，在领导和群众之间，必须要有一批骨干，来起模范带头作用和桥梁作用。先进生产者和先进工作者，就是这样的骨干力量。先进生产者和先进工作者一方面必须把自己的经验和群众的意见反映给领导；另一方面又要把领导上正确的决定和指示传达给群众，并且和群众一起去实现国家和人民交给的任务。
    李先念指出，这件事情并不是容易的。有些领导者接受你们的建议以后，就加以分析，作出决定，贯彻执行；但也有少数领导者对你们的建议，并不采取热心的态度，甚至抱着消极的态度和抵触情绪来对待你们。因此，同各种右倾保守思想和官僚主义作风进行斗争，就是非常必要的。
    李先念在讲话中特别提出，先进生产者和先进工作者必须具有谦虚朴素的作风，力戒骄傲自满，加强学习，提高觉悟，必须密切联系职工群众，向一切有长处的人学习，并且把自己的先进经验耐心地传授给大家。
    李先念讲话最后的一部分是关于关心职工的生活福利问题。他说，在动员广大职工群众投入社会主义建设的事业中，我们除了必须从政治上和思想上关心他们以外，还必须从物质福利方面关心他们。在过去几年里，我们党和政府无论从政治上经济上和物质福利上对广大职工都作了很多的工作，但在工资问题上我们也存在着一些缺点。这些缺点主要是表现在最近两年来职工工资增加的速度同国民经济发展和劳动生产率提高的速度很不适应。他说，党中央和国务院已经向有关方面指出这种缺点和错误，并且决定从今年第二季度起把职工工资适当提高。只要把职工群众的政治觉悟和物质利益结合起来，职工的劳动积极性就能够持久和巩固下去。
