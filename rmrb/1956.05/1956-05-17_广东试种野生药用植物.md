    Guangdong Trials Planting Wild Medicinal Plants
    To support the development of traditional Chinese medicine, the agricultural departments of Guangdong Province have recently been trialing the planting of a small amount of wild medicinal plants in five hundred agricultural production cooperatives and demonstration farms. They are also expanding the cultivation of twenty-four kinds of important medicinal materials already being grown, estimating an annual output of 56,000 dan of dried medicinal materials. Guangdong is rich in wild medicinal materials throughout the province, with more than 550 species. Previously, many medicinal materials were not well utilized. For example, the Aquilaria sinensis tree, from which agarwood is extracted, was always sold as firewood because no one knew its value. Last February, after a large number of dead and decaying Aquilaria sinensis trees were discovered in Panyu and other places, farmers were mobilized to collect them. By the end of April, more than 200 dan of agarwood had been put on the market. The total output value of various medicinal materials in the province last year reached 5 million yuan. In addition to meeting domestic medical needs, some of these medicinal materials are also exported to the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries.

    广东试种野生药用植物
    为了配合发展中医、中药事业，广东省农业部门最近在五百个农业生产合作社和示范农场试种少量野生药用植物；并扩大原有栽培的二十四种重要药材，估计年产量可得干药材五万六千担。广东野生药材遍及全省，种类有五百五十多种。以前很多药材一直没有很好的利用，如割取沉香的白木香树，由于无人知道，一向被当作木柴出卖，去年二月先后在番禺等地大量发现枯朽的白木香树，即发动农民采割，四月底就有二百余担沉香上市。全省去年各种药材的产值即可达五百万元。这些药材除供应国内医疗上需要外，有一部分还远销苏联和人民民主国家。
