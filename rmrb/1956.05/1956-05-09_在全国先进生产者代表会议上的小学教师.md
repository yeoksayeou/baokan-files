　　Elementary school teacher who insisted on educational work for forty-seven years
　　With the greatest perseverance and a high degree of love for education, the outstanding elementary school teacher Ren Ruiqing began teaching during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty and has never left the educational post. For 47 years, his students have been all over the country, and some have become technicians, some have become state cadres, and some have become agricultural experts. They are all engaged in the great cause of building the motherland in different work positions.
　　Ren Ruiqing started as a private school teacher at the age of twenty. In his long teaching life, he suffered all kinds of bullying and humiliation from landlords and local bullies.
　　In 1940, the Communist Party liberated his hometown, and the following year he was officially accepted as a glorious Communist Party member. At this time, he was already 52 years old. Although the environment was difficult, under the leadership of the Party, he actively insisted on the people's education cause. At that time, there were no good classrooms and quiet environments like now. In case of enemy situations, he had to take the students and carry the blackboard to the mountain gullies for classes, and sleep in the caves at night.
　　In 1942, when Ren Ruiqing's second son, Baoding, and a nephew sacrificed their lives, he buried the bodies of his son and nephew, wiped away his tears, and suppressed the grief in his heart. He said to his sixteen-year-old third son, Baoxi: "Crying cannot cry the Japanese devils and reactionaries to death, we must take revenge!" A few years later, his third son, Baoxi, also signed up to join the army.
　　For forty-seven years, Ren Ruiqing has taught all kinds of books. He has taught the Three Character Classic, the Hundred Family Surnames... After the Revolution of 1911, he taught new learning. At that time, many people did not approve of new learning, saying that old learning was profound and new learning was superficial. Ren Ruiqing now recalls humorously: "What is profound? It means the teacher doesn't understand, and the students don't understand, and that's called profound." He spent a lot of effort to promote new learning. Later, he taught all the courses in elementary school. Now, although he is 68 years old, he still serves as a history teacher in the school. He always prepares his lessons carefully and never perfunctorily. In order to consolidate the historical knowledge learned by the children, he often tells them some meaningful historical stories outside of class.
　　Many of the students he has educated over the decades have maintained contact with him. They often write to him to express their deep respect. Not long ago, a political instructor of a volunteer army company who participated in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea wrote him a letter and sent him four boxes of cigarettes, gifts from the comfort group.
　　For nearly half a century, Ren Ruiqing has dedicated all his energy to education. Now that he is old, he says: "What I have done in the past is still very little. In the future, I will work harder and contribute all my strength to our future generations."

　　Dai Youth Teacher Zhou Dejun
　　Zhou Dejun, a twenty-seven-year-old Dai youth, is the director of teaching affairs at the No. 12 Elementary School (Gelanghe Hani Autonomous Region) in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province. In 1952, Zhou Dejun was transferred by the government to Xiaohula in Gelanghe Hani Autonomous Region to start an elementary school. This was a difficult and challenging task, but Zhou Dejun thought: "The people of Gelanghe and Hani have no culture and have never had scholars. If everyone is afraid of difficulties and no one is willing to work in difficult places, how can the Gelanghe and Hani become a cultured nation?"
　　Zhou Dejun arrived in Xiaohula and established the school. However, the masses were unwilling to send their children to school, because there had never been scholars in the Gelanghe and Hani. They had many concerns about letting their children go to school: First, they were afraid of being beaten and scolded by teachers in school; second, they were afraid of going blind and dying after reading books (the Gelanghe and Aini have such superstitious legends); third, they were afraid of becoming lazy and unable to work after reading books; fourth, they were afraid of being transferred to far away places to work and unable to return after reading books and recognizing characters. They said: After studying for one year, you will be transferred down the mountain (to Menghai); after studying for two years, you will be transferred to Jinghong (the capital of the autonomous region); after studying for three years, you will be transferred to Pu'er; after studying for four years, you will be transferred to Kunming; after studying for five years, you will be transferred to Beijing and you will never be able to return. Zhou Dejun patiently said to them: Running schools for children to attend is the Communist Party's way of helping our fraternal ethnic groups understand culture and develop production, and it is helping our fraternal ethnic groups to stand up. After Zhou Dejun's explanation, although there were twenty-five students who signed up, only eight students came on the first day of school, and none of them were the students who had originally signed up. They were all replaced by their older brothers.
　　Zhou Dejun was not discouraged by this situation at all. He still distributed books to them (in the border fraternal ethnic areas, students are exempt from tuition, and the school distributes books and stationery to them) and taught them to read. However, this made him think that in order to make the masses send their children to school without any worries, it was necessary to do a lot of solid work. So he borrowed tools from the masses, cut wood to make "seesaws" and other toys for the children, and used his spare time to open up a playground for the children. Zhou Dejun did this, firstly, to make toys and create a playground for the children, and secondly, to show the masses whether people who have studied can work. The masses were surprised to see Zhou Dejun borrowing tools, cutting wood, and opening up a playground, and said, "Teacher Zhou can work." Zhou Dejun also went deep into the masses and said to them: "Han people have not gone blind or died after reading books." At the same time, he also used many concrete facts to repeatedly persuade the masses, so that the masses eliminated many worries. As a result, the number of students enrolled increased from eight to fifty-six.

　　Everything is for the children
　　Zhang Yuqin, at the age of seventeen, after graduating from Yushu County Normal School in Jilin, went to the people's education post with excitement. "I am going to be a teacher and educate children to become adults, how meaningful it is!" Zhang Yuqin thought at that time. At the end of October 1953, the weather in Northeast China was already cold. She arrived at Huaijia Village with simple luggage on a large cart. That year, the school started very late, and it was already November when classes started. She prepared her lessons until late at night the day before, and walked into the second-grade classroom with excitement and tension the next morning, but when she looked at it, the classroom was not what she imagined at all. The classroom was full of paper scraps, some tables had legs broken and were lying on the ground, and there was a thick layer of dust on the window sill. In such a messy classroom, some children were whispering, some were laughing, and they were noisily arguing and making trouble. This young girl almost cried when she encountered this situation for the first time in the classroom. She used a lot of strength to calm herself down and said to the children: "Students, don't make noise, we are going to start class." However, she did not speak immediately, she had to make the classroom quiet first. But as soon as she bent down to help the table lying on the ground, someone took the lead, and they all ran out of the classroom. Zhang Yuqin did not immediately blame them. She first wiped the dust off the table, swept the floor, and then installed the legs of the broken table. At this time, the door of the classroom opened gently, and a few children sneaked in first and started helping her without saying a word. Later, a few more children came in, and they ran up to her and said, "Teacher, we are here to help you."
　　In this way, she began to establish a teacher-student relationship with the children. Zhang Yuqin often played with the children in her spare time, and gave individual guidance or home visits to students who did not obey discipline. After her patient education, the children gradually changed their past bad habits. Later, the children no longer made noise during class.
　　In 1954, Zhang Yuqin was transferred to the branch of the Baoshou District Central Elementary School. One day, Liang Fayi, a fourteen-year-old student, came to her with an uneasy look and said hesitantly, "Teacher, why don't you come to my house!" She felt that this child must have something on his mind. Later, after inquiring, it turned out that Liang Fayi's father was ill, and the family was very difficult because of the flood that year, and his father planned not to let him go to school.
　　Zhang Yuqin arrived at Liang Fayi's home and saw that their family of six or seven people was living in very difficult circumstances. They said to Zhang Yuqin that because of the flood this year, there was no harvest in the fields, and Liang Fayi could not continue to study. Zhang Yuqin said: "Don't be afraid, we can always find a way for him. Fayi is doing very well in his studies, so don't let him be delayed." So, she saved her own money to buy books and pens for Liang Fayi to help him continue his studies.
　　In order to teach the children well, she often prepared her lessons until late at night. When she was preparing her lessons, she would clarify even the slightest doubt, and if she didn't understand, she would ask other teachers for advice. In class, Zhang Yuqin not only told the children the truth, but also thought of various ways to educate the children with real objects, so that the children could acquire real knowledge in each lesson.

　　Cultivating Children's Good Morals
　　When Yao Xiuyuan first came to Siming Lane Elementary School in Bengbu City, Anhui Province, the children's learning discipline was very bad, and the whole class was in a mess. During class, many children spoke casually without raising their hands, and some even fought and played, not listening to the class. This situation made her very distressed. At one time, she even lost confidence in the education of children; but when she thought that she was a member of the Youth League, she gained infinite courage. She was determined to change the children's learning discipline and cultivate them into well-rounded people. So, she paid special attention to the children's moral education.
　　In the classroom, she strengthened the moral education of the children through various courses. For example, when learning the lesson "Mijia's Five Points" in the Chinese class, she first let the children understand what kind of student Mijia usually was, what they were thinking when he and Liaonia were not prepared for their homework; and what they were thinking after he peeped at the grammar and got five points. Then she criticized the lazy thinking and harm of not studying hard, and let the children think about whether they had similar situations to Mijia in their studies. Due to her inspiration, many children said that they did not use their brains to learn arithmetic in the past, and only asked others for answers; individual children also talked about their cheating in exams, and understood that this was a bad behavior.
　　Outside the classroom, Yao Xiuyuan also worked hard. Such as visiting the children's families, holding small parent-teacher conferences; and having individual talks with the children to deeply understand the advantages and disadvantages of each child.
　　After she learned that many children had bad habits in life because they were badly influenced by old comic books and old drum books, she educated the children with some examples, such as how Ma Xiaoyan fell. At the same time, she selected some good books to introduce to the children to read. After the children became interested in the new books, they stopped reading the old comic books and listening to the old drum books.
　　In the process of conducting moral education for children, Yao Xiuyuan realized that educating children is not something that can be done well by the teacher's strength alone. So she paid attention to giving play to the organizational role of the Young Pioneers to help the children enrich the content of the team day.
　　She knew that to be a good class teacher, she must not only pay attention to the growth of the children's new qualities, but also enrich their knowledge, so while cultivating the children's conscious discipline, she also helped them to do well in their studies.
　　The children have made great progress after being educated. Seeing this situation, she felt infinite joy in her heart!
　　This semester, Yao Xiuyuan has been transferred to Deanli Elementary School in Bengbu City, Anhui Province as the deputy director of teaching affairs, cultivating the flowers of the motherland in a new work post.

　　在全国先进生产者代表会议上的小学教师
　　坚持教育工作岗位四十七年
    怀着最大的毅力和对教育事业的高度热爱，优秀的小学教师任瑞卿从清光绪年间就开始教学，到现在一直没有离开过教育岗位。47年来，他的学生满布全国各地，现在有的成了技术人员，有的是国家干部，有的是农业能手。他们都在不同的工作岗位上进行着建设祖国的伟大事业。
    任瑞卿从二十岁那年开始当私塾教师，在漫长的教学生活里，受尽了地主、豪绅的欺侮和凌辱。
    1940年共产党解放了他的家乡，第二年他正式被接受为光荣的共产党员。这时候他已经52岁了。虽然环境艰苦，但是他在党的领导下，积极地坚持着人民教育事业。那时候不像现在这样有很好的教室和安静的环境，一有敌情就得带着学生背着黑板到山沟里上课，晚上就睡在山洞里。
    1942年任瑞卿的次子宝鼎和一个侄儿牺牲的时候，他埋了儿子和侄儿的尸体，抹干了眼泪，抑制着内心的悲痛，他对十六岁的三子宝玺说：“哭不能把日本鬼子和反动派哭死，要报仇！”过了几年，他的三子宝玺也就报名参军了。
    四十七年来，任瑞卿教过各种各样的书，他教过三字经、百家姓……。辛亥革命以后，他教新学。当时很多人不赞成新学，说旧学深厚，新学浅薄。任瑞卿现在回忆起来，幽默地说：“什么深厚？就是先生教不懂，学生学不懂，这就叫深厚。”他为了提倡新学曾费了很大的力量。后来，他教过小学校的各门课程。现在他虽然68岁了，但仍然在学校里担任历史课的教员。他总是认真备课，从来没有马虎过。为了巩固孩子们所学的历史知识，他还经常在课外给孩子们讲一些有意义的历史故事。
    几十年来经他教育出来的学生，许多人还同他保持着联系，他们经常给他写信，向他表示深切的敬意。不久以前，有一位参加抗美援朝的志愿军的连指导员给他写来了信，还把慰问团赠送的礼物四盒香烟寄来给他。
    将近半个世纪的时间，任瑞卿把所有的精力都献给了教育事业。现在他虽然老了，但是他说：“我过去做的还很少，今后我还要努力，把自己全部的力量都贡献给我们的后一代”。

    傣族青年教师周德俊
    二十七岁的傣族青年周德俊，是云南省西双版纳第十二小学（格朗和哈尼族自治区）的教导主任。1952年，周德俊被政府调到格朗和哈尼族自治区的小呼拉去创办小学，这是一件坚苦的、困难的工作，但是周德俊想：“格朗和哈尼族人民没有文化，从来没有过读书人，如果大家都怕困难，谁也不愿到坚苦的地方去工作，格朗和哈尼族怎么能成为有文化的民族呢？”
    周德俊到了小呼拉，把学校建立起来了。但是群众不愿意把子女送到学校来学习，因为在格朗和哈尼族里从来没有过读书人，让子女进学校去念书，他们有许多顾虑：一怕上学要挨老师打骂；二怕读了书会眼瞎、会死（格朗和爱尼族有这样一种迷信传说）；三怕读了书以后会变成懒人，不会劳动；四怕读了书识了字会被调到很远的地方去工作，回不来。他们说：读一年书调下山（到孟海），读两年书调到允景洪（自治区首府），读三年书调到普洱，读四年书调到昆明，读五年书调到北京就再也不能回来了。周德俊耐心地对他们说：办学校给孩子们上学是共产党为了帮助我们兄弟民族懂得文化，发展生产，是帮助我们兄弟民族翻身。经过周德俊的解释，报名的学生虽然有了二十五个人，但到开学那天只来了八个学生，而且都不是原来报名的学生，都是由他们的哥哥来顶替的。
    周德俊对于这种情况，一点也不灰心，仍然把书发给他们（在边疆兄弟民族地区，学生入学免交学费，由学校把书籍文具发给他们），教他们读。但是，这使他想到，要使群众毫无顾虑地把子女送到学校来上课，还需要做许多踏实的工作。于是他向群众借了工具，把木头砍来给孩子们做“跷跷板”以及其他的玩具，而且利用课余时间给孩子们开辟了一个操场。周德俊这样做，一来给孩子们做了玩具，辟了操场，二来给群众看看读过书的人会不会劳动。群众看见周德俊借工具，砍木头，辟操场，都惊奇地说：“周老师会劳动的。”周德俊又深入到群众中对群众说：“汉人读了书也没有眼瞎，也没有死。”同时，他还用许许多多的具体的事实反复地向群众进行说服工作，使群众消除了许许多多的顾虑。于是，入学的学生由八个人增加到了五十六个人。

    一切为了孩子
    张玉琴十七岁那年，从吉林榆树县师范学校毕业之后，怀着兴奋的心情走向人民教育岗位。“就要当老师了，教育孩子成人，该多么有意义啊！”张玉琴那时候这样想。1953年10月底，东北的天气已经冷了。她带着简单的行李坐着大板车到了槐家村。那年学校开学很晚，上课的时候已经是十一月了。她头天晚上备课到了深夜，第二天早晨带着兴奋而紧张的心情走进了二年级的教室，可是一看，教室完全不是她想像的那样。教室里满地纸屑，有的桌子掉了腿躺在地上，窗台上落了厚厚的一层土。在这样一间乱七八糟的教室里，孩子们有的交头接耳，有的笑，乱哄哄地吵着、闹着。这个年轻的姑娘第一次跨进教室遇到这种情况，差一点儿没有哭出来。她用了很大的力量使自己冷静下来对孩子们说：“同学们不要闹，我们就要上课了。”可是，她并没有马上讲，必须使教室安静下来才行。可是她刚一弯腰想扶起躺在地下的桌子，不知是谁带头，一哄都跑出教室去了。张玉琴没有立即责备他们，她先拂去桌子上的土，扫了地，再把掉了腿的桌子装上腿。这时候教室的门轻轻地开了，有几个孩子先溜进来，一声不响就动手帮她工作。后来又进来几个孩子，他们跑到她跟前来对她说：“老师，我们来帮助你。”
    就这样，她开始和孩子们建立了师生的感情。张玉琴每天在课余的时间常常和孩子们在一起玩，对不守纪律的学生进行个别辅导或家庭访问。经过她的耐心的教育，孩子们逐渐改掉了过去的坏习惯。后来孩子们在上课的时候，就再也不乱吵乱闹了。
    1954年张玉琴被调到了保寿区中心小学分校。有一天，十四岁的学生梁法义来到她的跟前，神色不安，半吞半吐地对她说：“老师，你怎么不上俺家去呢！”她觉得这孩子一定有什么心事。后来一打听，原来梁法义的父亲病了，加上那年闹水灾，家里很困难，父亲打算不叫他上学了。
    张玉琴到了梁法义家里，看到他们一家六、七口人，生活很困难。他们对张玉琴说，因为今年闹水灾，地里没收成，梁法义的书念不成了。张玉琴说：“不怕，总能替他想个办法。法义的功课很好，千万不要叫他耽搁了。”于是，她就把自己的钱省下来给梁法义买书买笔，帮助他继续上学。
    为了教好孩子，她备课经常到深夜。她在备课的时候那怕有一点疑问也要搞清楚，不懂的时候就请教别的教师。上课的时候，张玉琴不但给孩子们讲道理，还想各种办法用实物对孩子们进行教育，使孩子们每上一课都能获得真正的知识。

　　培养孩子们的优良品德
    当姚秀媛最初来到安徽蚌埠市四明巷小学的时候，孩子们的学习纪律是很不好的，整个班上都是乱哄哄的。上课的时候，许多孩子不举手就随便说话，有的还下位打架，玩耍，不听课。这种情况使她十分苦恼。有一个时候她甚至对孩子们的教育失去了信心；但当她一想到自己是个青年团员的时候，就增加了无限的勇气。她决心要把孩子们的学习纪律改变过来，把孩子们培养成为全面发展的人。于是，她特别注意了孩子们的品德教育。
    在课堂上，她通过各门课程来加强对孩子们的品德教育。例如在语文课里学到“米嘉的五分”这一课的时候，她首先让孩子们了解米嘉平时是个什么样的学生，当他和辽尼亚没有准备好功课的时候，心里是怎样的；当他偷看了文法而得到五分以后，心里想些什么。接着她批判了学习不踏实的懒惰思想和害处，并且让孩子们想想自己在学习当中是否有和米嘉类似的情形。由于她的启发，许多孩子说出了过去学算术不动脑筋，光问别人答案；个别孩子还谈到了自己考试作弊的情形，并且懂得了这是一种不好的行为。
    在课外，姚秀媛也努力进行了一些工作。如对孩子们的家庭进行访问，召开小型的家长座谈会；并且和孩子们进行了个别谈话，深入地了解了每一个孩子的优点和缺点。
    当她了解到许多孩子因为受到旧小人书和听旧词大鼓书的坏影响，而在生活上染上了不好的习气的情形以后，她用一些实例如马小彦是怎样堕落的事情对孩子们进行了教育。同时，她选择了一些好书介绍给孩子们读。孩子们对新书有了兴趣以后，便不再去看旧小人书和听旧词大鼓书了。
    在对孩子们进行品德教育当中，姚秀媛认识到教育孩子不光是老师一个人的力量能作得好的。于是她注意发挥少年先锋队的组织作用，帮助孩子们丰富队日的内容。
    她知道做好一个班主任，不仅要重视孩子们新品质的成长，而且要丰富他们的知识，所以她在培养孩子们自觉纪律的同时，也帮助他们搞好学习。
    孩子们经过教育，进步是很大的。看到这种情形，她从内心里感到无限喜悦！
    这学期姚秀媛已经调到安徽蚌埠市德安里小学作副教导主任，在新的工作岗位上培养着祖国的花朵。
