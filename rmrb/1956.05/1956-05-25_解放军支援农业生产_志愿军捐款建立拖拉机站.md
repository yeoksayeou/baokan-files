Xinhua News Agency, May 24th -- People's Liberation Army units stationed in various locations are actively assisting local agricultural production cooperatives in their agricultural production work. Recently, officers and soldiers of a certain unit stationed in the Lüda area spent four days building six large reservoirs with a total capacity of 25,000 tons of water for the Gaofeng Agricultural Cooperative in their area, preventing drought damage to more than 3,000 mu of land. A certain unit stationed in Haikou City, Hainan Island, formed a labor force of over 800 people and heightened a 400-meter-long section of seawall in the western suburbs of the city by one meter, ensuring the safety of thousands of mu of farmland in the suburbs. Now that the wheat harvesting season has arrived in the south, PLA officers and soldiers stationed in a certain area of Fujian Province have formed ten brigades to help agricultural cooperatives harvest wheat.

Various units are also helping agricultural cooperatives train veterinary personnel and hygiene and accounting staff. The Veterinary Bureau of the General Logistics Department recently sent three veterinarians to the Xiaotun Township Agricultural Cooperative in Fengtai District, Beijing, to help carry out veterinary work. They conducted glanders examinations and anthrax vaccinations for over 500 head of livestock, established sick horse stables and diagnostic yards for the agricultural cooperative, cured many sick horses, and trained four veterinary staff members.

    解放军支援农业生产
    志愿军捐款建立拖拉机站
    据新华社24日讯　中国人民解放军驻各地部队正积极帮助驻地农业生产合作社进行农业生产工作。驻旅大地区的某部官兵，最近利用四天时间给驻地高峰农业社修建了六座共容水两万五千吨的大水库，使三千亩以上的土地不再遭到旱灾。驻在海南岛海口市的某部组成八百多人的劳动队，将市西郊全长四百多公尺的一段海堤加高了一公尺，保证了郊区数千亩良田的安全。现在，南方割麦的季节到了，驻福建省某地的解放军官兵组成了十个大队，帮助农业社收割麦子。
    各部队还帮助农业社训练兽医人员和卫生、会计工作人员。总后勤部兽医局不久前派兽医三人到北京市丰台区小屯乡农业社帮助开展兽医工作。他们对五百多头牲畜进行鼻疽检查和炭疽预防注射，还给农业社建立病马厩和诊断场，治好很多病马，培养了四名兽医工作人员。
    据新华社平壤24日电　中国人民志愿军官兵捐款建立拖拉机站支援祖国农业合作化的活动，已经取得了很大成绩。到目前为止，志愿军全军官兵捐款总额已经达到七十四万六千六百五十六元七角六分。捐献活动仍在全军中继续进行。
