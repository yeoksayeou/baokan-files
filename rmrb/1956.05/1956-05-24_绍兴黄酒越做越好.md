Shaoxing Yellow Wine Gets Better and Better

The Shaoxing Winery, a local state-owned enterprise in Zhejiang Province, has produced over 7,000 vats, totaling 4.4 million jin, of yellow wine this year. Every vat contains good wine, with not a single vat of substandard wine, and over 80% of the wine exceeds the quality standard for Grade A wine. To ensure the quality of the yellow wine this year, the factory adopted various technical measures during the winter brewing season, held technical training classes, and also summarized past good experiences.
