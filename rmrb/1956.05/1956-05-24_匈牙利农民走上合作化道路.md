Hungarian Peasants Embark on the Road to Cooperativization
Huang Caoliang Hu Sisheng

	On the vast lands of Hungary, whether in the suburbs closer to the cities or in remote mountain gullies far on the border, more and more peasants are ending their wavering position at the crossroads and embarking on the road to agricultural cooperativization. As of January 1 this year, there were a total of 4,985 agricultural production cooperatives, nearly 4,000 of which were advanced. 256,000 households are participating in the cooperatives, accounting for about 20% of the agricultural population. The arable land area owned by the cooperatives accounts for 21% of the country's land. If we add the 13% of the country's arable land owned by state-owned farms, then more than one-third of Hungary's arable land already belongs to the socialist sector. Since the beginning of this year, the cooperative movement has developed relatively rapidly, and the number of people participating in the cooperatives has increased significantly.
	The Hungarian agricultural cooperativization movement has developed after overcoming various difficulties. Its development has gone through the following stages:
	In 1948, the Hungarian Working People's Party decided to launch the cooperative movement. Comrade Rákosi pointed out the path for peasants to get rid of poverty and live a prosperous life forever. At the end of 1948, the first 300 agricultural production cooperatives were established. At that time, all possible methods were tried to develop the agricultural cooperative movement. By 1952, the cooperative movement had developed relatively rapidly. More than 270,000 people had participated in the cooperatives, and the cooperative's cultivated land area accounted for 19% of the country's cultivated land area. However, while the agricultural cooperative movement was booming, errors of coercion and violation of the principle of voluntariness occurred in some places, which brought harmful consequences to the consolidation and development of the cooperative cause. Subsequently, the Central Committee of the Working People's Party exposed these errors and formulated measures to eliminate them.
	However, since the second half of 1953, some people have made right-leaning mistakes in implementing the Working People's Party's policy of correcting left-leaning errors. These people violated the party's resolutions and distorted the party's cooperative policy with anti-Marxist right-leaning views. They advocated that individual peasants could also embark on the road to socialism by adopting individual management methods like cooperatives. They used various methods to promote the development of the individual economy, let the cooperatives run their own course without giving them support, and emphasized the freedom of peasants to withdraw from the cooperatives. Under the influence of this right-leaning error, a certain degree of chaos occurred in the countryside. Some peasants hesitated, some cooperatives dissolved, and some peasants withdrew from the cooperatives with their land and livestock. But even in this situation, many cooperatives and peasants still adhered to the party's cooperativization policy and resolutely took the socialist road.
	In March 1955, the Working People's Party liquidated the right-leaning errors that occurred in the agricultural cooperativization movement, putting the agricultural cooperativization movement back on the right track. The cause of cooperativization has since developed steadily and is advancing towards greater victories.
	Many vivid facts we have seen, contacted, and heard in Hungary have left us with a deep impression: In Hungarian agriculture, the superiority of the socialist economy is becoming more and more obvious. It is attracting more and more people, making the socialist position in the countryside increasingly expanded and strengthened, and the capitalist position is shrinking day by day, and will inevitably move towards extinction in the end.
	Now, cooperatives are increasingly outperforming individual farmers in terms of production. In 1955, the average yield of various major crops per hold (equal to 8.55 mu) of land in cooperatives was 10% to 15% higher than that of individual farmers. Taking Xumuki County as an example, the average yield of wheat per hold of land in the county's cooperatives was 1,080 kilograms, while individual farmers only produced 910 kilograms. On the basis of expanded production, the business of the cooperatives is thriving, and the lives of the members are constantly improving. Generally speaking, the annual income of cooperative farmers can provide for their family's life for two years. In the vast countryside, many cooperative members have built new houses, added various new furniture, and purchased beautiful clothing, bicycles, and radios. More than 85% of the members of the Red Star Cooperative, nearly 200 kilometers southwest of Budapest, have radios. We visited the family of Nagy Mihály, a member of the Gorkámándi Cooperative, 120 kilometers away from Budapest. He returned to his hometown when the Soviet army liberated Hungary. At that time, only four walls were left, nothing else, not even a roof. At the beginning of the liberation, he worked for wealthy middle peasants. The ration tickets issued at that time could not be bought with money, and life was very difficult. He joined the cooperative in 1949. Since then, life has improved day by day. Now he has a very good house, brand new furniture in the bedroom, beautiful glass chandeliers, and two oil paintings hanging on the wall, one of which is the famous painting "The Last Supper". Last year, he and his wife worked a total of 591 workdays, earning more than 40,000 forints. He told us with great satisfaction: "The income last year alone is enough for the family to live for two years without working. I have never received such a good income in my life." A young farmer from the Red Star Cooperative, Dömötör, told us: His family of three earned a total of 52,000 forints last year. He bought a new house for 50,000 forints this year. We asked him if he had a radio at home, and he simply replied: "Of course." He is also planning to buy a motorcycle. The family of Goldus József surprised us even more. He bought this very elaborate house in 1953 and added a complete set of new furniture and equipment last year, with very beautiful beds, sofas, dressing tables, high-quality glass cabinets, carpets, and so on. The families of Nagy Mihály, Dömötör, and Goldus József are not miracles, but a common phenomenon among the hundreds of thousands of Hungarian peasants who have joined cooperatives.
	The superiority of the socialist economy is attracting more and more peasants like a powerful magnet. The proportion of people participating in cooperatives is growing relatively quickly. Last year, a total of 60,000 peasant households joined the cooperatives, and more than 30,000 households joined the cooperatives in the first three months of this year alone. Not only the broad masses of poor and hired peasants are participating in the cooperatives, but also a considerable number of middle peasant masses. In the Red Star Cooperative and some other cooperatives, they have been constantly receiving farmers from local villages who come to request to join the cooperative since the beginning of this year, many of whom are middle peasants. Among the 198 people who have joined the Red Star Cooperative since the beginning of this year, 120 are middle peasants.
	On the basis of the steady progress of the cooperative movement, the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party made a decision last year to accelerate agricultural collectivization, requiring the number of people participating in cooperatives to reach 70% of the agricultural population by 1960 and to develop the existing primary cooperatives into advanced cooperatives. This means that by then, socialism will occupy an advantage in agriculture and achieve a decisive victory.
	In order to achieve this goal, the Hungarian people still have to make great efforts, and are making various efforts. At present, the key issue for the forward development of the Hungarian agricultural cooperative movement is how to win over the broad masses of middle peasants to participate in this movement, abandon the road of individual economy, and embark on the socialist road. Although a considerable number of middle peasants have already joined the cooperatives in some places, it is very uneven from a regional perspective. Generally speaking, there are more middle peasants participating in cooperatives where the cooperatives are well-run, and fewer middle peasants participating in cooperatives where the cooperatives are poorly run. In general, the number of middle peasants participating in cooperatives is still small. The number of middle peasants accounts for 55% to 56% of Hungary's 4 million agricultural population, but only about 10% of the middle peasant population participates in cooperatives. This means that only one middle peasant out of ten middle peasants has joined the cooperative. Why are the broad masses of middle peasants watching and not moving forward with the cooperative? This is closely related to the relatively prosperous life of the broad masses of middle peasants in Hungary. Hungarian middle peasants have more land and livestock, and more labor, and live a relatively prosperous life. According to the standards stipulated here for rural class components, those with 6.7 holds of land to 25 holds of land, two horses, and several cattle are considered middle peasants. We visited an individual middle peasant named Kvátski in the village of Bálcsegere on the southern border of Hungary. His house is very beautiful, and the equipment in his home is very elaborate. You simply can't believe it is a middle peasant family. He has 19 holds of land, about 162 mu of land, eight cattle, two horses, and seventeen pigs. He said that he was unwilling to join the cooperative. He bluntly said: Even if we don't join the cooperative, our life is not bad.
	Winning over the broad masses of middle peasants to join the cooperative and take the road of cooperativization is not an easy task. Now, the party and government in Hungary are taking various measures to guide the peasants, especially the middle peasants, to embark on the broad road of cooperativization to a bright future. A very important measure is to take various methods to help run the existing and future cooperatives well, and turn the cooperatives into exemplary socialist large enterprises, so that the production of the cooperatives and the income of the members will greatly exceed that of individual farmers. The state has now decided to increase investment in cooperatives, improve the level of mechanization of cooperatives, and help the construction of cooperatives in all aspects. Investment in cooperatives has increased to 4 billion forints within five years, and it is also stipulated to provide long-term loans of 2.6 billion forints to cooperatives. Thousands or tens of thousands of highly productive and extremely prosperous cooperatives will illuminate and guide the broad masses of peasants to voluntarily take the road of cooperativization like brightly lit lighthouses.
	The Hungarian agricultural cooperativization movement is moving forward steadily. In the near future, people will see that under the correct leadership of the Hungarian Working People's Party, with the broad masses of peasants having a socialist awareness, the agricultural cooperativization movement will achieve a comprehensive victory in the countryside, turning the Hungarian countryside into a happier and more prosperous socialist countryside.

    匈牙利农民走上合作化道路
    黄操良　胡思升
    在匈牙利广大的土地上，不论是在离开城市较近的郊区，或远在边疆的偏僻的山沟里，愈来愈多的农民正在结束自己在十字路口上的摇摆不定的立场，走上农业合作化的道路。到今年一月一日止，一共有四千九百八十五个农业生产合作社，其中高级的近四千个。参加合作社的有二十五万六千户，人数占到农业人口的20％左右。合作社所拥有的可耕地面积，占到全国土地的21％。如果加上国营农场拥有全国13％的可耕地，那就是说匈牙利全国已经有三分之一还多的可耕地属于社会主义成分了。今年初以来，合作化运动有了比较快的发展，参加合作社的人数是显著地增多了。
    匈牙利农业合作化运动是在克服了各种各样的困难以后发展起来的。它的发展经历了这样几个阶段：
    1948年，匈牙利劳动人民党决定发动合作化运动。拉科西同志给农民指出了永远摆脱贫困和过富裕生活的道路。1948年底第一批三百个农业生产合作社建立起来了。当时曾想尽一切办法来发展农业合作化运动。到1952年，合作化运动有了比较快的发展。参加合作社的已有二十七万多人，合作社耕地面积占全国耕地面积的19％。但是，随着农业合作化运动蓬勃发展的同时，强迫命令和违反自愿原则的错误，在一些地方发生了，这给合作化事业的巩固和发展带来了有害的后果。接着劳动人民党中央揭露了这些错误，并制定了消除这些错误的措施。
    但是，自1953年下半年起，在执行劳动人民党纠正左倾错误的方针时，有些人又犯了右倾的错误。这些人违反了党的决议，以反马克思主义的右倾观点来歪曲党的合作化政策。他们宣扬个体农民采用个体经营的方式，同合作社一样也可以走上社会主义的道路，他们用各种办法促进个体经济的发展，对合作社放任自流，不给予支持，而且强调农民自由退社。在这种右倾错误的影响下，农村中发生了一定的混乱，有些农民彷徨了，一部分合作社解散了，一部分农民带着他们的土地和牲口，退出了合作社。但是即使在这种情况下，许多合作社和农民，仍旧坚持着党的合作化政策，坚决地走着社会主义的道路。
    1955年3月，劳动人民党清算了在农业合作化运动中发生的右倾错误，使农业合作化的运动重新纳上正轨，合作化事业从此稳步地向前发展着，向更大的胜利前进着。
    我们在匈牙利看到，接触到和听到的许多活生生的事实，给我们留下了很深的印象：在匈牙利的农业中，社会主义经济的优越性愈来愈显明地表现出来，它吸引着愈来愈多的人们，使社会主义在农村的阵地日益扩大和增强着，资本主义的阵地正日益缩小，最后不可免地要走向灭亡。
    现在，合作社在生产方面愈来愈明显地胜过个体农民。1955年，合作社的各种主要农作物，每霍尔德（等于八点五五市亩）土地平均都要比单干农户多生产10％到15％，比如以蓄木基州作为例子，全州合作社麦子一霍尔德土地平均生产一千○八十公斤，个体农民只有九百一十公斤。在生产扩大的基础上，合作社的业务欣欣向荣，社员的生活不断上升。一般说来，合作社的农民一年所得，可供他的家庭生活二年。在广大的农村里，许多合作社社员盖起了新屋子，添置各种新式的家具，购买漂亮的服装、脚踏车和收音机。在布达佩斯西南近二百公里的红星合作社的社员，85％以上有了收音机。我们访问了离布达佩斯一二○公里的高尔考曼底合作社的社员纳吉·米哈尔的家庭。他在苏联军队解放匈牙利的时候回到了他的家乡，那时只剩下四堵墙，什么也没有，连屋顶也没有，解放之初，他跟富裕中农做工，那时发下的配给票没有钱购买，生活很困苦，他在1949年就参加了合作社。从此生活就一天天好起来，现在他有一所很好的房屋，在卧房里有全新的家具，漂亮的玻璃花灯，壁上挂着两张油画，其中一张是名画“最后的晚餐”。去年他和妻子共作了五百九十一个劳动日，收入超过四万福林。他很满意地告诉我们：“去年一年的收入一家不工作也可活两年，这样好的收入是我一生从未得到过的。”红星合作社的一个年轻的农民杜孟哥施告诉我们：他一家三人去年共收入五万二千福林，他今年用五万元买了一所新房子。我们问他家里有没有收音机，他简捷地回答说：“当然有”。他还准备买一架机器脚踏车。高尔杜施·雅瑟夫的家庭使我们更加惊讶，他在1953年购买了这座很讲究的住房，去年添置了全套新的家具和设备，有很漂亮的床，有沙发，梳妆台，有质量很高的玻璃柜，有地毯等等。纳吉·米哈尔、杜孟哥施和高尔杜施·雅瑟夫的家庭，并不是什么奇迹，而是在数十万参加合作社的匈牙利农民中的普遍现象。
    社会主义经济的优越性，像强力的磁石一样吸引着愈来愈多的农民。参加合作社的人数的比例在比较快地增长着。去年参加合作社的共有六万农户，今年头三个月就已有三万多户参加了合作社。参加合作社的不仅是广大的贫雇农群众，而且也有相当数目的中农群众。在红星合作社和其他一些合作社里，今年以来经常接待着从当地村里前来要求参加合作社的农民们，其中有很多是中农。在今年以来参加红星合作社的一九八人中，就有一二○人是中农。
    在合作化运动稳步前进的基础上，匈牙利劳动人民党中央去年作出了加速农业集体化的决定，要求到1960年参加合作社的人数发展到农业人口的70％，把现有的初级合作社发展成为高级社。这就是说，到那时，要使社会主义在农业中占据优势，并取得决定性的胜利。
    为了达到这个目的，匈牙利人民还要作很大的努力，而且正在作着各种努力。目前，匈牙利农业合作化运动向前发展的关键问题，便是如何争取广大中农群众参加到这个运动中来，抛弃个体经济的道路，走上社会主义的道路。虽然现在有些地方已有相当数量的中农参加了合作社，但是从地区来说是很不平衡的，一般说来，合作社办得好的地方，参加合作社的中农要多些，合作社办得差的地方，参加合作社的中农就要少一些。总的说来，中农参加合作社的人数还是不多的，中农人数占到匈牙利四百万农业人口的55％到56％，但是参加合作社的中农只有中农人口的10％左右，这就是说，十个中农中还只有一个中农参加了合作社。广大的中农群众为什么对合作社观望不前呢？这和匈牙利广大的中农群众的生活的比较富裕是很有关系的。匈牙利的中农土地和牲口比较多，劳动力也比较多，生活过得比较富裕，根据这里对农村阶级成分规定的标准，具有六、七霍尔德土地到二十五霍尔德土地，有两匹马和几头牛的，算作中农。我们访问了匈南边境上的鲍尔契哥莱村上一家姓克伐其的个体中农，他的房子很漂亮，家里设备很讲究，简直使你不能相信是个中农家庭。他有十九霍尔德土地，约合一六二市亩地，八头牛，二匹马，十七头猪，他表示不愿参加合作社，他率直地说：不参加合作社，我们的生活过得也并不坏。
    争取广大中农加入合作社和走合作化的道路，并不是一件轻而易举的事情。现在匈牙利的党和政府正在采取各种措施，来引导农民，特别是中农走上美好未来的合作化的康庄大道。一个很重要的措施就是：采取各种办法帮助办好已经有的和将要建立的合作社，把合作社变成示范的社会主义大企业，使合作社的生产和社员的收入大大超过个体农民。国家现在已决定增加对合作社的投资，提高合作社的机械化水平，并且在各方面来帮助合作社的建设。在五年内对合作社投资已增加为四十亿福林，并且还规定给合作社长期贷款二十六亿福林。几千个或者是几万个生产力很高和极为繁荣的合作社，将像万丈光芒的灯塔一样，照亮着并且引导着广大的农民群众自愿地走上合作化的道路。
    匈牙利的农业合作化运动，正在稳步地前进着，不久的将来，人们将要看到：在匈牙利劳动人民党的正确领导下，在广大农民有了走社会主义的觉悟，农业合作化运动将要在农村中取得全面的胜利，把匈牙利的农村变成更加幸福和富裕的社会主义农村。（附图片）
