    On the Banks of the Angara River
    By A. Srevtsev, Soviet Union

    Lake Baikal's water fills the deepest depression in the world. The average depth of Lake Baikal is 1,000 meters, and near Olkhon Island, it reaches over 1,700 meters. The lake holds twenty-two times more water than the Aral Sea and ninety-nine times more than the Sea of Azov. It is 636 kilometers long and reaches a width of eighty kilometers in some places. Three hundred and thirty rivers, large and small, flow into Lake Baikal, and only one flows out—the turbulent Angara River. On average, it carries sixty billion cubic meters of water from Lake Baikal each year.

    Lake Baikal is not only an inexhaustible source of water but also ensures the steady flow of the Angara River, creating an excellent natural regulating reservoir for the construction of hydroelectric power stations. A cascade of hydroelectric power stations will be built on the Angara River, generating electricity at a remarkably low cost. For example, the cost of each kilowatt-hour of electricity from the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station, which is under construction, will be less than one kopeck.

    The electricity generated by the Angara River within the Irkutsk Oblast will account for approximately 30% of the Soviet Union's source of cheap electricity. The total generating capacity of these hydroelectric power stations will reach several million kilowatts, with an annual electricity production of over seventy billion kilowatt-hours. And this may not be the limit. Currently, two hydroelectric power stations—the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Station and the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station—are under vigorous construction on the Angara River.

    The village of Kuzmikha is sixteen kilometers from Irkutsk. The Irkutsk Hydroelectric Station is being built here. On March 17, 1950, excavators dug the first bucket of earth from the pit in the Kuzmikha Gorge, marking the beginning of the hydroelectric station's construction. Currently, railway branch lines, transmission lines, and communication lines have been laid on both banks of the Angara River. Huge semi-automated concrete factories, auto repair shops and garages, lumber mills, and precast reinforced concrete factories have been built. Four residential areas with multi-story buildings, schools, clubs, shops, hospitals, kindergartens, and nurseries have sprung up. The builders have demonstrated bold creativity and a pragmatic flexibility, solving complex tasks in hydraulic engineering.

    The dam, towering over twenty meters high in the river, and the right bank dam have reduced the width of the Angara River channel from 1,250 meters to 165 meters. Last winter, installers fitted the stators for the first two turbines.

    The Angara River will be blocked in May, and electricity will begin to be supplied by the end of 1956. The Irkutsk Hydroelectric Station, with a generating capacity of 660,000 kilowatts, will be fully operational during the Sixth Five-Year Plan period.

    After the construction is completed, many changes will occur here. The waters of the Angara River will rise higher than the dam, and ships from Lake Baikal will be able to sail all the way to Irkutsk.

    Not long ago, the first transmission line pole was erected on the southern outskirts near the city of Angarsk. The power lines from Irkutsk will cross eleven districts of the province; the electricity from the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Station will be transmitted directly to the construction site of the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station.

    The Irkutsk-Bratsk transmission line will be completed in the shortest possible time. Bratsk will receive electricity by March of next year. The magnitude of this project in the coming year can be seen from the following: the construction of the Kuibyshev-Moscow transmission line, which is equal in length to this line, took five years. Enriched by advanced experience and armed with the country's top technology, the construction workers are confident that they will overcome all difficulties and welcome the new year of 1957 in Bratsk.

    What work is currently underway at the construction site of the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station? What will the appearance of this greatest hydraulic engineering project be?

    ...In October 1954, the first workers appeared in the small village of Savelyanovka, not far from the ancient Siberian town of Bratsk. Now, a new Savelyanovka has emerged next to this village. On the right bank of the Angara River, opposite the new village, felled timber is rolling down from the mountaintop into the river, while in the distance, the mountains are still shrouded in blue smoke. Below, on the riverbank, stretches the street of Bratsk. The management office of the hydroelectric station construction project is concentrated in Savelyanovka. Every day, people with extremely diverse professions come here from all over the country.

    From Bratsk, through the great forest, along the road to Badon (the location of the main construction of the future Bratsk Hydroelectric Station), an asphalt road has been laid. Only a few months ago, this was just a winding path.

    The great Siberian forest is receding further and further. In Badon, Savelyanovka, Osinovka, and other construction sectors, there are fewer and fewer tents. In their place, well-equipped houses have been erected for the construction workers who have come from many hydroelectric station construction sites across the country—the Kama Hydroelectric Station, the Gorky Hydroelectric Station, the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station, the Mingechaur Hydroelectric Station, and others.

    Currently, there are about eight thousand construction workers at the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station. In the past year, this collective has achieved a great deal. Last year, the construction and installation work was completed by 112.5%. The original plan was to build 25,000 square meters of housing, and 26,000 square meters have been completed. More than two hundred kilometers of communication lines and transmission lines have been erected. Forty-eight kilometers of railway connecting the right bank of the Angara River to the Taishet-Lena railway line and seventy kilometers of highway have been laid...

    The amount of work involved in building the Bratsk hydraulic hub will be enormous. It is necessary to excavate forty to fifty million cubic meters of earth and rock, pour ten million cubic meters of concrete and reinforced concrete, and lay about three hundred kilometers of railway lines and nearly four hundred kilometers of highway. It is also necessary to erect high-voltage transmission lines and establish a complete set of huge production and auxiliary enterprises needed by the construction site. In order to ensure that work does not stop when the project is fully underway, 35,000 to 40,000 workers are needed. A city will appear in the great Siberian forest—New Bratsk.

    The whole country is supporting the construction workers here. Steel has been sent from Stalinsk, excavators, winches, and machines have been transported from Voronezh and the Urals, automobiles have been driven from Moscow, Yaroslavl, and Minsk, and top-notch technological equipment and building materials have been transported from dozens of other cities.

    A great goal unites the construction workers of the largest hydroelectric power station on the Angara River, and that is to complete the tasks assigned by the Party and the government in a timely manner. For this purpose, tractor driver Nikolai Sviridov transported goods four times to a dangerous cliff where a slight oversight could have cost his life. Fyodor Agenko built furnace after furnace in the severe cold. He had never done furnace repair work before, but now he has become a furnace repairman: because people need warmth. Youth League member Rashid Migasov did not leave the welding machine for twelve hours because he wanted to weld the water pipes faster...

    In Badon, a place with turbulent water flow, a dam five kilometers long will extend. A huge reservoir, 570 kilometers long and 6,000 square kilometers in area, will be formed in the middle reaches of the Angara River.

    Sixteen huge generating units, each with a generating capacity of 200,000 to 250,000 kilowatts, will be installed in the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station's powerhouse. No hydroelectric power station in the world has ever been equipped with similar generating units. In terms of generating capacity, the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station is equivalent to five Dnieper Hydroelectric Stations.

    The powerful energy of the first batch of power stations in the Angara River cascade will be used to transform Eastern Siberia. Based on exceptionally rich mineral resources and cheap electricity, some of our country's largest aluminum smelting, mining, and chemical industrial enterprises will be established. The Irkutsk Oblast will become a major supplier of light metals, synthetic rubber, synthetic liquid fuels, synthetic fibers, and many other products. Electric trains will speed along the railway trunk lines from east to west. The Irkutsk Oblast will become a completely electrified province.

    All of this will be realized in the near future. And now, the attack on the Angara River is unfolding day and night, and the construction of the huge hydroelectric station continues.

    在安加拉河河岸上
    苏联　阿·斯雷夫采夫
    贝加尔湖的水注满了世界最深的一块凹地。贝加尔湖的平均深度是一千公尺，而在靠奥里衡岛的岸边，深度达一千七百公尺以上。这个湖的水比咸海多二十二倍，比亚速海多九十九倍。湖的长度是636公里，宽度在某些地点达到八十公里。有三百三十条大大小小的河流注入贝加尔湖，而从湖中流出来的只有一条河——波涛汹涌的安加拉河。它平均每年从贝加尔湖带走六百亿立方公尺的水。
    贝加尔湖不仅是一个取之不竭的水源，而且保证安加拉河水流平稳、为水电站的建设创造了最好的天然调节水库。在安加拉河上将建筑一系列水电站的阶梯，发出的电将以成本低廉著称。例如，建筑中的布拉次克水电站的每度电力，成本将不到一个戈比。
    在伊尔库次克州境内安加拉河所发的电力大约将占全苏联廉价电力来源的30％。这些水电站的总发电能力将达数百万瓩，每年的发电量在七百亿度以上。这可能还不是极限。目前，在安加拉河上正在大力进行两个水电站——伊尔库次克水电站和布拉次克水电站的建筑。
       ×　×　×
    库兹米哈村距伊尔库次克十六公里。伊尔库次克水电站就建设在这里。1950年3月17日挖土机在库兹米哈峡谷的土坑里挖出了第一吊斗的土，开始了水电站的建筑。目前在安加拉河的两岸已敷设了铁路支线、输电线和通讯线路，建筑了巨大的半自动化混凝土工厂、汽车修理场和车库、木材工厂和钢筋混凝土制件工厂，出现了四个拥有多层楼房、学校、俱乐部、商店、医院、幼儿园和托儿所的住宅区。建筑者们表现了大胆的创造性和实事求是的灵活性，解决了一些水力工程中的复杂任务。
    耸立河中高达二十多公尺的堤坝和右岸堤坝已经把安加拉河河身的宽度从1，250公尺缩小到165公尺。去年冬天，安装工已为头两部汽轮机安装了固定子。
    安加拉河的河床将于五月拦断，而在1956年底将开始供电。发电能力为六十六万瓩的伊尔库次克水电站将在第六个五年计划时期全部投入生产。
    在建筑工程完成后，这里将发生很多的变化。安加拉河的水将涨得比堤身还高，从贝加尔湖来的轮船可以一直驶抵伊尔库次克。
    不久前，在靠近安加拉斯克城的南郊，竖立起了第一根输电线的电杆。电线从伊尔库次克起将穿越本州的十一个区；伊尔库次克水电站的电流将通过这条线路直达布拉次克水电站的建筑工地。
    伊尔库次克—布拉次克输电线将在最短促的时期内建成：明年三月布拉次克就可获得电力。至于未来一年中这项工程的浩大，只从下面这一点就可以看出：为敷设同这条线路长度相等的古比雪夫—莫斯科输电线曾用了五年时间，为先进经验所丰富，并为祖国的头等技术装备所武装起来的建设人员都抱有这样的信心，他们将克服一切困难，并将在布拉次克迎接新的1957年。
    目前在布拉次克水电站建筑工地上正在进行怎样的工作？这个最伟大的水力工程建设将具有怎样的外貌呢？
    ……1954年10月在距这个古老的西伯利亚小城市布拉次克不远的萨维尔扬依卡小村出现了第一批工人。现在在这个村子旁边已经出现了新的萨维尔扬依卡。在新村对面的安加拉河右岸，锯倒的木材正从山顶上滚入河中，而在远处，仍然是为蓝烟所笼罩的山脉。下面，在河岸上，延伸着布拉次克的街道。水电站建筑工程的管理处就集中在萨维尔扬依卡。每天都有职业极不相同的人从全国各地来到这里。
    从布拉次克起，通过大森林，沿着去巴敦（未来布拉次克水电站主要建筑的所在）的方向，铺设了柏油公路，而在几个月以前，这里还仅是一条蜿蜒的羊肠小道。
    西伯利亚大森林越退越远了。在巴敦，萨维尔扬依卡，奥辛诺夫卡以及其他建筑工段上，帐篷越来越少了。在它们原来的位置上，已经耸立起了设备良好的、供从全国许多水电站建筑工地——卡马水电站、高尔基水电站、卡霍夫卡水电站、明格查乌尔水电站等——来的建筑人员用的房屋。
    目前，在布拉次克水电站的建筑工作人员约为八千人。一年以来，这个集体已取得了很多成绩。去年，建筑安装工作完成了112.5％。原计划建筑二万五千平方公尺住宅，已完成了二万六千平方公尺。架设了二百多公里的通讯线路和输电线。铺设了连接安加拉河右岸和塔依西特—列拿干线的、长达四十八公里的铁路线和延伸达七十公里的公路线……。
    建筑布拉次克水力枢纽占的工程量，将是浩大的。必须进行四千万到五千万立方公尺的挖土和挖岩石的工作，浇灌一千万立方公尺的混凝土和钢筋混凝土，铺设约三百公里的铁路线和近四百公里的公路线。还需要架设高压输电线并建立建筑工地所需要的整套巨大的生产和辅助企业。为了在工程全面展开后工作不发生停顿，就需要三万五千到四万工人。在西伯利亚的大森林中将出现一个城市——新布拉次克。
    全国都在支援这里的建筑工作者。从斯大林斯克送来了钢材，从沃龙涅什和乌拉尔运来了挖土机、卷扬机、机器，从莫斯科、雅罗斯拉夫里和明斯克开来了汽车，另外还从几十个城市运来了头等的技术设备和建筑材料。
    一个伟大的目标把安加拉河上的最大水电站的建筑人员联合了起来，这就是及时完成党和政府所交给的任务。为了这个目的，拖拉机手尼古拉·斯维里多夫四次把货物运到一个稍有疏忽便会送命的险崖上去。费道尔·阿庚科在严寒中砌好了一个炉子又一个炉子。他以前从未作过修炉工作，但是现在他已成了修炉匠：因为人们需要温暖。青年团员拉西德·米加索夫有十二个小时没有离开焊接机，因为他想更快地把水管焊接好……。
    在巴敦这个水流湍急的地方将伸出一条长达五公里的堤坝。在安加拉河中游将形成一个长达五百七十公里、面积达六千平方公里的巨大水库。
    在布拉次克水电站的厂房内将装置十六部发电能力各为二十万到二十五万瓩的巨大联动机。世界上还没有哪个水电站曾装过类似这样的联动机。以发电能力计算，布拉次克水电站等于五个第聂伯水电站。
    安加拉河梯级的第一批电站的强大动力将用来改造东部西伯利亚。在异常丰富的矿藏和廉价电力的基础上将建立起我国的一些最巨大的制铝、采矿和化学工业的企业。伊尔库次克州将成为轻金属、人造橡胶、人造液体燃料、人造纤维和其他许多产品的巨大供应者。电气火车将沿着铁路干线东西奔驰。伊尔库次克州将成为完全电气化的一个州。
    这一切都要在最近的将来实现。而现在则正在不分昼夜地向安加拉河展开进攻，巨大水电站的建筑工程正在继续进行中。
