　　Where Does the Disagreement on Disarmament Lie?
　　Tan Wenrui
　　The United Nations Disarmament Commission's Subcommittee meeting in London has adjourned. Since the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee was established in 1954, it has held a total of eighty-six meetings, but the meetings have still not reached even a preliminary agreement on the urgent disarmament issue. At this London meeting, the Soviet Union, in order to seek an agreement, put forward a new disarmament plan, which fair-minded public opinion in various countries believes takes into account the opinions of all parties and stipulates practical and feasible steps, providing a good foundation for breaking the disarmament deadlock; however, the Western countries still refused to accept the Soviet proposal, and they even retreated a big step from the positions they had originally advocated. In order to conceal their sinful behavior of obstructing disarmament, the Western countries issued a statement after the meeting, insisting that the reason why the London meeting was a failure was because the Soviet Union did not accept their proposals, trying to confuse world public opinion. But the truth of the matter is, as Soviet representative to the Disarmament Subcommittee, Gromyko, pointed out in his speech on May 6, there is a very big difference between the Soviet Union's attitude and the attitude of the Western countries on the entire disarmament issue. And this difference is deliberately created by the Western countries in order to obstruct disarmament.

　　Where to Start?

　　A major reason why the disarmament issue has not been resolved for a long time is that the Western countries resolutely disagree with banning nuclear weapons. Their reason for not agreeing to ban nuclear weapons is that the Soviet Union has strong armed forces, so the Western countries must maintain nuclear weapons to maintain the "balance of power." But when the Soviet Union agreed to reduce its armed forces to the level suggested by the Western countries, they refused to reach an agreement on banning nuclear weapons, using the excuse that it was impossible to effectively supervise the production and storage of nuclear weapons. For a long time, the Western countries have been clinging to nuclear weapons to obstruct the progress of disarmament work.

　　In order to break the disarmament deadlock, the Soviet Union's proposal this time advocated starting with the reduction of conventional armaments and armed forces, without making the prohibition of nuclear weapons a prerequisite for disarmament. The Soviet Union's advocacy does not mean that it agrees to put the issue of banning nuclear weapons aside; on the contrary, the Soviet Union hopes that the countries concerned will reach an agreement on the reduction of conventional armaments, which will lead to the resolution of the issue of banning nuclear weapons. The former British Foreign Secretary Macmillan also expressed his support at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference last year for trying to obtain a preliminary agreement on the reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments first. The Soviet Union's current advocacy of starting with the reduction of conventional armaments is a concession to the Western countries' proposals, with the aim of minimizing differences as much as possible so that disarmament can begin as soon as possible. In principle, since the Soviet Union's proposal has already adopted the proposals originally put forward by the Western countries, it should be responded to and approved by the Western countries.

　　But that is not the case. The Western countries deliberately distort the Soviet Union's proposal, saying that the Soviet Union's concession is a "retreat," insisting that the Soviet Union's advocacy of reaching an agreement on the reduction of conventional armaments and armed forces first is unwilling to ban nuclear weapons, and using such an excuse to refuse to accept the Soviet proposal. The Western countries want to use this tactic to cover up their betrayal of their original proposals.

　　Who Doesn't Want to Abandon Nuclear Weapons?

　　Anyone who is not forgetful will remember that it is the Soviet Union, not any other country, that has been advocating the banning of nuclear weapons for ten years. The new proposal put forward by the Soviet Union at this London meeting also stipulates that, regardless of whether an agreement is reached on the issue of disarmament, countries should take measures to reduce the threat of atomic war, including immediately ceasing thermonuclear weapon tests and prohibiting troops stationed on German territory from being equipped with atomic weapons. Soviet leaders Bulganin and Khrushchev solemnly declared at a press conference in London on April 27 that the Soviet Union, while considering the reduction of conventional armaments, does not ignore the issue of banning atomic and hydrogen weapons. This all shows that the rumors deliberately spread by the Western countries are baseless.

　　The Western countries are now pretending to be enthusiastic about banning nuclear weapons, but in reality, they are still trying their best to evade atomic disarmament. The disarmament proposal recently put forward by the United States does not mention the banning of nuclear weapons at all. American newspapers have bluntly said: "The attitude of the United States towards disarmament is that any practice of prohibiting atomic weapons should be shelved for the distant future." Although the British and French proposals mention the banning of nuclear weapons, they postpone the discussion on the destruction of such weapons indefinitely. The "New York Times" of the United States once said: In the British and French proposals, "the issue of destroying existing nuclear weapons is deliberately cancelled and left as a pending case to be resolved at an indefinite future date." Not only that, but the British and French proposals, on the one hand, vaguely advocate that all countries give up the use of nuclear weapons, and on the other hand, reserve the right to use such weapons at any time in the name of "dealing with aggression." And everyone knows that the Western countries have always been unwilling to give a scientific and precise definition to "aggression" in the United Nations. They also disagree with the Security Council guaranteeing that atomic weapons will not be abused. It can be seen that their program is actually to leave the door open for themselves to use atomic weapons. This is not in line with the wishes of the people of all countries who demand the fundamental elimination of the threat of atomic war.

　　The Level of Conventional Armaments

　　From another point of view, since the Western countries now emphasize that it is difficult to ban nuclear weapons in the absence of an atmosphere of international trust, they should adopt a more positive attitude so that everyone can reach an agreement on the issue of reducing conventional armaments and armed forces, so that disarmament can be started quickly, the burden of armaments can be reduced, and the international atmosphere can be improved, so as to promote the final realization of universal disarmament and complete prohibition of atomic weapons. In this regard, the Soviet Union has taken the initiative to suggest that various countries undertake specific obligations for a large reduction in armaments and armed forces. The Soviet proposal stipulates that the United States, the Soviet Union, and China should each reduce their armed forces to one million to one million and a half people, and the United Kingdom and France should each reduce their armed forces to 650,000 people; the level of armed forces in other countries should be determined by the World Universal Disarmament Conference, but this level should not exceed 150,000 to 200,000 people. The conventional armaments and military expenditures of various countries should be reduced accordingly at the same time. The level of disarmament specified here is almost what the Western countries have advocated in the past. If the Western countries keep their original proposals, the countries concerned should have easily reached an agreement in this regard. But this time the Western countries abandoned their own past proposals. The British and French proposals do not mention the limit of armed forces of various countries at all, and the American proposal greatly increases the limit of armed forces from the level set by the original Western countries' proposals, making the reduction of the Western countries, especially the American army, nominal. This fickle attitude of the Western countries shows that their basic consideration is how to maintain the differences between the two sides, so when the Soviet Union moves closer to the opinions of the Western countries in order to promote an agreement, the Western countries do not hesitate to retreat from their own original proposals to avoid the conclusion of an agreement. The reduction of conventional armaments, which the West has always advocated, has also been fruitless so far, the only reason being that the Western countries do not actually want to reach an agreement. Isn't this obvious?

　　Disarmament and Supervision

　　Another excuse the United States used to refuse the Soviet disarmament proposal in the past was that the Soviet Union advocated "disarmament without supervision." In order to show the sincerity of the United States, it also put forward a so-called "aerial inspection" plan, which even American newspapers said was worthless. It is groundless to say that the Soviet Union does not want supervision. The Soviet Union has never ignored the necessity of effectively supervising disarmament work, and the proposal to implement truly effective ground inspections was put forward by the Soviet Union. At this London meeting, the Soviet Union proposed the establishment of a strict international supervision system to supervise the implementation of measures to reduce conventional armaments and armed forces. It not only advocated giving broad powers to international supervisory agencies to conduct full and effective inspections in all signatory countries, but also agreed that when a comprehensive disarmament plan is implemented to a certain stage, the countries concerned can consider adopting the "aerial inspection" plan advocated by the United States as a method of supervision. But the United States insisted on giving priority to the implementation of its "aerial inspection" plan, and even advocated limiting the disarmament work to starting a small-scale experimental supervision plan, without making any provisions for comprehensive disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. The United States is obviously doing this to keep the disarmament work still at the level of endless talk of "supervision without disarmament," and to allow the arms race to continue. Does this have anything in common with the sincere desire for true disarmament?

　　Such Preconditions

　　No one denies that the disarmament issue is closely related to some other international issues. The resolution of the disarmament issue can increase trust between countries, thereby helping to resolve other international issues. French Prime Minister Mollet also said not long ago that if the disarmament issue is resolved first, it will be easier to resolve other international issues.

　　But the United States requires that certain contentious issues, such as the German unification issue, be resolved first; manipulating so-called preconditions to obstruct the agreement. Stassen openly said that "the necessity of resolving political issues before achieving drastic or extensive disarmament" is one of the "fundamental attitudes of the West towards the disarmament issue." It should also be pointed out that the British and French phased disarmament plans stipulate that before actually taking practical disarmament steps, it is also necessary to examine the world situation at that time to determine whether to implement the disarmament plan, and all disarmament measures can be stopped at any time. This will actually make the realization of disarmament dependent on the resolution of other international issues.

　　This approach by the Western countries can only be to prevent the realization of disarmament. Everyone knows that it is the Western countries, not others, that are creating numerous obstacles to the resolution of many international issues. The famous disarmament proposal put forward by the Soviet Union in May last year first required the adoption of eight specific measures to promote international trust and create a favorable atmosphere for disarmament. But the Soviet proposal was rejected. It is a well-known fact that the United States and other Western countries that follow it create numerous obstacles to the resolution of outstanding international issues, but use the fact that these issues have not been resolved as an excuse to obstruct disarmament.

　　Based on the above, it is easy for people to understand that the main obstacle hindering the work of the Disarmament Subcommittee is the stubborn attitude of the Western countries, first of all the United States, in not wanting to resolve the disarmament issue. They deliberately create differences and obstruct the reaching of an agreement, while trying to shift the responsibility to the Soviet Union. But the people of all countries will judge the truth from the actual actions and practices of the Soviet Union and the Western countries. The people demand disarmament, and it is impossible to obstruct it for a long time by any means.

　　裁军问题的分歧何在
    谭文瑞
    联合国裁军委员会小组委员会在伦敦举行的会议已经休会。自从联合国裁军小组委员会在1954年设立以来，一共已经举行了八十六次会议，但是会议仍旧没有能就迫切的裁军问题取得甚至是初步的协议。在这一次伦敦会议上，苏联为了谋求协议，又提出了一个新的裁军方案，各国的公正舆论都认为苏联的方案考虑到了各方面的意见，规定了切实可行的步骤，为打开裁军僵局提供了良好的基础；但是西方国家还是拒绝接受苏联的建议，它们甚至从它们自己原先主张过的立场倒退了一大步。为了掩饰自己阻挠裁军的罪恶行为，西方国家在会后发表声明，硬说伦敦会议所以一事无成是由于苏联不接受它们的建议，想这样来混淆世界人民的视听。但是事实的真相是正如苏联出席裁军小组委员会代表团团长葛罗米柯五月六日发表的谈话所指出的，在整个裁军问题上，苏联的态度同西方国家的态度之间存在着非常大的差别。而这种分歧正是西方国家为了阻挠裁军而故意制造的。
    从何入手？
    裁军问题长期没有能够解决，一个主要的原因就是西方国家坚决不同意禁止核子武器。它们不同意禁止核子武器的理由是苏联拥有强大的武装部队，所以西方国家必须保有核子武器以维持“实力的均势”。但是当苏联同意了根据西方国家建议的水平裁减武装部队，它们又以无法对禁止核子武器的生产和储存实行有效的监督为借口，拒绝就禁止核子武器达成协议。长久以来，西方国家就是这样死抱住核子武器来阻挠裁军工作的进展。
    为了打开裁军问题的僵局，苏联这一次提出的建议主张从裁减常规军备和裁减武装部队入手，不把禁止核子武器作为裁军的一个先决条件。苏联这样主张并不是说同意把禁止核子武器的问题搁置一旁，相反的，苏联是希望有关各国就裁减常规军备问题达成协议，会导致禁止核子武器问题的解决。英国的前外交大臣麦克米伦在去年四国外长会议上也曾表示赞成设法先取得一个有关裁减武装部队和常规军备的初步协定。苏联现在主张先从裁减常规军备入手，是对西方国家的主张的一种让步，目的是为了尽量缩小分歧，使裁军可以早日得以开始。按道理，苏联的建议既然已经是采纳了西方国家原来提出的主张，它应当获得西方国家的响应和赞同。
    但是事情却不是这样。西方国家对于苏联的建议故意进行曲解，它们把苏联的让步说成是“退步”，硬说苏联主张先就裁减常规军备和武装部队问题达成协议是不愿意禁止核子武器，而拿这样的借口来拒绝接受苏联的建议。西方国家想用这种手法来掩盖它们背弃自己原先提出的主张。
    谁不想废弃核子武器？
    任何不健忘的人都不会不记得，是苏联而不是别的国家十年来一直力主禁止核子武器。就是苏联在这一次伦敦会议上提出的新建议也还规定了：各国不问对裁军问题是否达成协议，应该采取包括立刻停止热核子武器试验、禁止驻扎在德国领土上的军队配备原子武器等减少原子战争威胁的措施。苏联领导人布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫四月二十七日在伦敦举行记者招待会时郑重声明，苏联在考虑裁减常规军备的问题同时，并不忽视禁止原子武器和氢武器问题。这都说明西方国家故意散布的流言是毫无根据的。
    西方国家现在假装热心于禁止核子武器，实际上，它们仍是极力逃避原子裁军。美国最近提出的裁军建议，就根本不提禁止核子武器的问题。美国的报纸曾直言不讳地说：“美国对裁军所抱的态度是，任何禁止原子武器的做法都应当搁到遥远的将来”。英法的建议虽然谈到禁止核子武器，却把关于销毁这种武器的讨论无限期地搁延。美国“纽约时报”曾经说：在英法建议中“关于销毁现有的核子武器的问题是有意取消的，作为悬案留到不定期的将来去解决。”不仅如此，英法建议一方面空泛地主张一切国家放弃使用核子武器，另一方面又在“对付侵略”的名义下保留随时使用这种武器的权利。而大家知道，西方国家在联合国中一直就不愿意给“侵略”下一个科学的确切的定义。它们也不同意由安理会来保证原子武器不被滥用。由此可见，它们这种方案实际上是要给自己使用原子武器留下方便之门。这是不符合要求根本消除原子战争威胁的各国人民的愿望的。
    常规军备的水平
    换一个角度来说，既然西方国家现在强调，在缺乏国际信任空气的情况下禁止核子武器很困难，它们理应采取较积极的态度，使大家能够在裁减常规军备和武装部队的问题上达成协议，以便可以迅速开始裁军，减轻军备负担，并改善国际气氛，以便促成最后实现普遍裁军和完全禁止原子武器。在这方面，苏联已主动地建议各国承担大量裁减军备和武装部队的具体义务。苏联的建议规定：美国、苏联和中国各把武装部队裁减到一百万到一百五十万人，英国和法国各裁减到六十五万人；其他国家武装部队的水平则由世界普遍裁军会议决定，但这种水平不应当超过十五万到二十万人。各国常规军备和军费应同时相应地缩减。这里规定的几乎就是西方国家过去所主张的裁军水平。如果西方国家信守它原来的主张，有关各国在这方面本应当很容易达成协议的。可是这一次西方国家抛弃了它们自己过去提出的方案。英法的建议根本不提各国武装部队的限额，美国的建议则把武装部队的限额从原先西方国家提出的方案所定的水平大大地提高，而使得对西方国家特别是美国军队的裁减变成有名无实。西方国家这种变化无常的态度，说明它们的基本考虑就是怎样来保持双方的分歧，所以当苏联为了促成协议而向西方国家的意见靠近一步的时候，西方国家甚至不惜从它们自己原先的主张后退来躲避协议的达成。西方一向主张的裁减常规军备迄今也是毫无结果，其唯一原因就是西方国家实际上不想达成协议。这难道还不明显吗？
    裁军和监督
    美国过去拒绝苏联裁军建议，其另外一个借口是说苏联主张的是“没有监督的裁军”。为了标榜美国的诚意，它还煞有介事地提出了一个所谓“空中视察”计划，这个计划连美国的报纸也说是一钱不值。说苏联不要监督是毫无根据的。苏联从来就没有忽视对裁军工作进行有效监督的必要，而且实行真正有效的地面视察的主张就是苏联提出来的。在这一次伦敦会议上，苏联建议建立严格的国际监督制度，以监督裁减常规军备和武装部队措施的实行。它不仅主张给予国际监督机构以广泛的权力，在各签字国进行充分和有效的视察，并且同意到实行全面裁军计划的某一阶段，有关国家可以考虑采取美国主张的“空中视察”计划作为监督的一个方法。但是美国硬要优先实行它的“空中视察”计划，甚至主张把裁军的工作限于开始一个小规模试验性的监督计划，而不就全面裁军和禁止原子武器作任何规定。美国这样做显然是要使裁军工作仍然停留在无休止的“没有裁军的监督”的空谈上，让军备竞赛继续进行下去。这同真正希望裁军的真诚愿望难道有任何相同之处吗？
    如此先决条件
    谁也不否认，裁军问题同其他一些国际问题有着密切关系。裁军问题的解决，能够增加国与国之间的信任，从而有助于解决其他的国际问题。法国总理摩勒不久以前也说过，如果首先解决裁军问题，那么解决其他国际问题就比较容易了。
    但是美国却要求首先解决某些争执中的问题，例如德国统一问题；搬弄所谓先决条件来阻挠协议。史塔生公开说：“在实现剧烈的或广泛的裁军以前先解决政治问题的必要”是“西方对待裁军问题的根本态度”之一。还应当指出英法的分阶段裁军方案规定在真正采取实际的裁军步骤以前，还得考察一番当时的世界形势才能决定是否把裁军计划推行下去，而且随时都可以停止一切裁军措施。这实际上也会使裁军的实现取决于其他国际问题的解决。
    西方国家的这种作法只能是为了阻止裁军的实现。大家都知道，阻止许多国际问题的解决的不是别人，而正是西方国家。苏联在去年五月提出的著名的裁军建议，就首先要求采取八个具体措施来促进国际信任，为裁军创造有利的气氛。但是苏联的建议却被拒绝了。人所共见的事实是，美国以及追随它的其他西方国家为解决悬而未决的国际问题制造重重障碍，却又拿这些问题未得解决的事实来作为阻挠裁军的借口。
    根据上面所述，人们很容易明白，阻碍着裁军小组委员会工作的主要障碍，就是西方国家，首先是美国，不愿意解决裁军问题的顽固态度。它们故意制造分歧，阻挠达成协议，同时却力图把责任推到苏联的身上。但是各国人民是会从苏联和西方国家的实际行动和作法来判别真伪的。人民要求裁军，想用任何方法长期阻挠下去是办不到的。
