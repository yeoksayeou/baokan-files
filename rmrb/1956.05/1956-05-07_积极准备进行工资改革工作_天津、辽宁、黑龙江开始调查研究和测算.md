Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 6th: Tianjin is actively carrying out preparations for wage reform. The Tianjin Municipal Wage Committee has been established, and secondary wage committees have been successively established in the municipal state-owned industry, local state-owned industry, state-owned commerce, culture, education, health, and state organs systems.

These wage committees have begun preliminary investigations and research into the city's labor productivity growth, worker wages, and welfare over the years. They are now conducting calculations by department and industry based on the wage reform plan drafted at the National Wage Conference, in order to formulate specific plans for Tianjin's wage reform. According to the person in charge of the Tianjin Municipal Wage Committee, the city's calculation work is expected to be completed in about ten days.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 6th: Preparation for wage reform in Liaoning Province has begun.

The wage reform leadership and offices at the provincial, municipal, and county levels were established in mid- to late-April. The spirit of the National Wage Conference has been conveyed to some cadres.

The Liaoning Provincial Wage Reform Office has four groups: the State Organs and Non-Industrial Wages Group, the Local Industry and Public Utilities Wages Group, the State-Owned Industry Wages Group, and the Welfare Group. The research and calculation work on the new wage plans drafted by various ministries of the Central Government has been basically completed, and preparations are being made for another round of unified balancing. Each group has also conducted detailed investigations into current employee wage standards, employee living standards, and market prices. Issues such as the promotion and pay increase percentages for cadres and employees, piecework coefficients, high-temperature wage rates, subsidies, and rewards have all been studied.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 6th: The members of the Heilongjiang Provincial Wage Committee did not rest even on this Sunday, and are still busy studying wage reform work.

The Provincial Wage Committee has already calculated the wages between various regions and enterprises within the province, and between different personnel within enterprises. With reference to the wage standards of state-owned enterprises, state organs, and state institutions, it has preliminarily formulated a wage standard plan for local state-owned enterprises and local institutions that do not have unified standards set by the state. During this period, the Provincial Wage Committee also investigated the prices of means of subsistence in several regions for reference when formulating wage standards.
