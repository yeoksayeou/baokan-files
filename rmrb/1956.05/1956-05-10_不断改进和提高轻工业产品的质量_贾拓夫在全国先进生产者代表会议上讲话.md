Comrade Jia Tuofu, Director of the Fourth Office of the State Council, spoke at the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Producers on the 8th, detailing the issues of further developing China's light industry. He said that in the three years from 1953 to 1955, the total output value of consumer goods nationwide increased by nearly half, an average annual increase of over 13%. During this period, preliminary statistics for light industry and textile industry showed an increase of more than 3,000 new products. Some products that could not be manufactured in the past, such as penicillin and sulfonamides, can now be produced in large quantities. At present, consumer goods still account for more than half of the total industrial output value, with the textile industry ranking first, accounting for more than a quarter of the total industrial output value; the food industry ranks second, accounting for more than one-fifth. This has basically satisfied the needs of the people's material and cultural life and, to a certain extent, improved their material and cultural living standards.

Jia Tuofu pointed out that the development of light industry production is not only to meet the needs of the people's lives but also to accumulate funds for national industrialization. If the funds accumulated by light industry and textile industrial enterprises for the country during the three years from 1953 to 1955 were used collectively, they could build more than a dozen steel plants with an annual output of 500,000 tons of steel. During this period, the state's investment in light industry's basic construction funds plus working capital was less than a quarter of the above figure, and the basic construction of light industry enterprises can generally recover all investment within one year.

Jia Tuofu then explained the relationship between light industry and other national economic sectors. He said that the development of light industry is also to cooperate with the needs of heavy industry, agriculture, and other national economic construction and development. Taking heavy industry as an example, some light industrial products are indispensable parts or raw materials for automobiles, tires, trains, electrical instruments, etc. Without the cooperation of these light industrial products, the development of these heavy industrial sectors would be affected. The relationship between light industry and agriculture is even closer. More than 90% of the raw materials of light industry come from agriculture, and most of the products are supplied to rural areas. If agriculture has a good harvest, light industry production will have favorable conditions for smooth development; if agriculture has a bad harvest, light industry production will be immediately affected. In general, the rapid recovery and development of agricultural production in recent years has largely guaranteed the supply of raw materials needed for light industry production; conversely, the development of light industry has expanded the processing volume of agricultural products and promoted the development of agriculture. Under the current upsurge of agricultural cooperation and production, if light industry production cannot develop accordingly, it will inevitably affect the development of agriculture. With the development of agricultural production, the continuous improvement of farmers' lives, and the continuous increase in purchasing power, light industrial products have been provided with a broad sales market, prompting light industry to increase output, improve quality, and increase variety. Due to the increase in the output of light industrial products and the reduction in costs, the price difference between industrial and agricultural products has narrowed, and the exchange ratio of grain, cotton, peanuts, sesame, sugar cane, and other products for light industrial products has also increased. In 1952, 100 jin of peanut kernels could only be exchanged for 21 jin of white sugar, 130 jin of salt, and 160 packs of matches. In 1954, it increased to 29.5 jin of white sugar, more than 182 jin of salt, and 177 packs of matches. This is of great significance for increasing farmers' income, improving farmers' lives, and strengthening the worker-peasant alliance.

Jia Tuofu pointed out that the above situation shows that the production of light industry must be actively developed accordingly under the overall plan of the state. There has been considerable development in the past, but according to the general trend of national economic development, this is still not enough, and there should be more development in the future. Does such development violate the policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry? If this is a proportional development under the guidance of the state plan with raw materials, sales channels, and production capacity, rather than blind and one-sided development, then this not only does not violate the policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, but on the contrary, it helps to realize the policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, precisely for the purpose of developing heavy industry more and faster. Because the funds accumulated by light industry are constantly increasing, heavy industry can be developed more and faster.

Jia Tuofu said that the development we are talking about is not just about new construction. Development should have two aspects: new construction is one aspect, and fully utilizing the production potential of existing enterprises, including necessary expansions and renovations, is also one aspect. For light industry, the first thing is to fully utilize the production potential of existing enterprises, including possible expansions and renovations. If this is still not enough to meet the needs, then consider new construction. In order to adapt to the needs of the first five-year plan, especially the second five-year plan, for national economic development, it is entirely necessary to build more than 100 large-scale light industrial and textile factories during the first five-year plan; in the second five-year plan, there will be more new light industrial factories appearing. However, what is more important at present is to fully utilize the production potential of existing enterprises to comprehensively complete and over fulfill the state's plan in a manner that is more, faster, better, and more economical.

Jia Tuofu said that when considering fully utilizing the production potential of existing enterprises, the potential of light industrial enterprises of various economic types must be considered as a whole. In terms of light industrial output value, the production of state-owned and local state-owned enterprises accounts for less than half, while that of joint state-private, private, and handicraft enterprises accounts for more than half. As everyone knows, the potential of joint state-private and private enterprises, as well as handicrafts, is much greater than that of state-owned enterprises. After socialist transformation, these enterprises have obtained more favorable conditions for exerting their production potential; we should comprehensively consider the production potential of these enterprises, take overall consideration and give due consideration to all parties, and give full play to it.

He said that when considering fully utilizing the production potential of existing enterprises, the production potential of enterprises across the country should also be considered as a whole. Enterprises in the inland areas should fully utilize their potential, and enterprises in the coastal areas should not be restricted, but should also be fully and rationally utilized. Up to now, about 70% of China's light industry is in coastal areas, which means that most of the existing light industry is in the coastal areas, and they are the main body for exerting existing production potential; moreover, the production technology conditions and cooperative relations of enterprises in coastal areas are generally better than those in inland areas. Giving full play to the potential of enterprises in coastal areas is beneficial to the people and the country; this is not only not contradictory to the development of inland industry, but it is also to support the state in building more new factories in the inland areas with human, material, and financial resources to develop inland industry.

Jia Tuofu pointed out that fully utilizing the potential of existing enterprises is a very important issue for any national economic sector. It is especially important for light industry. This is because in the field of light industry, the potential of existing enterprises is still very large. Taking equipment utilization rate as an example, it is generally not high, and some are very low. As for the various enterprises in various industries, and the workshops of various enterprises, there are still differences between advanced and backward in terms of output, quality, and cost, and some differences are very large. If the backward ones are raised to the existing advanced level, then more and better products can be produced for the people and the country, and more construction funds can be accumulated.

Jia Tuofu cited the specific example of the achievements made in 1955 after promoting Li Chuanjiang's advanced oil extraction method in the national oil industry, saying that it is entirely possible to bring backward enterprises up to the advanced level. He said that the key lies in how to fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, how to break certain leadership conservatism and bureaucratism, combine leadership with the masses, summarize and promote advanced experience well, and help the backward improve technology, improve management, and catch up with the advanced level. In other words, it is necessary to further carry out the advanced producer movement.

He pointed out: Further carrying out the advanced producer movement in the field of light industry is mainly to improve product quality, reduce costs, increase output, and ensure production safety.

After criticizing the low quality of some products and the unstable quality of some products in some enterprises, Jia Tuofu particularly hoped that everyone would pay attention to the quality of light industrial products. He said: Our socialist industry must produce excellent products; continuously improving and improving product quality is the guiding principle of socialist industrial production. This issue is of more urgent significance for the current light industry production. Therefore, when carrying out advanced producer movements, labor competitions, and rationalization proposals in the field of light industry, improving and improving product quality should be regarded as a major task or a major topic. Of course, while improving product quality, we must also pay attention to the requirements of reducing costs and increasing output, and we cannot only pursue quality one-sidedly, regardless of cost, so as to increase the burden on consumers. At the same time, we must always pay attention to safe production.

### 不断改进和提高轻工业产品的质量  贾拓夫在全国先进生产者代表会议上讲话

　　不断改进和提高轻工业产品的质量
    贾拓夫在全国先进生产者代表会议上讲话
    国务院第四办公室主任贾拓夫八日在全国先进生产者代表会议上详细讲述了进一步发展我国轻工业的问题。他说，在1953年到1955年的三年间，全国消费资料的生产总值增长了将近半倍，平均每年增长13％以上。在这个期间，轻工业、纺织工业等方面的初步统计，一共增加了新产品三千多种。有些过去不能制造的产品，如盘尼西林、磺胺等，现在可以大量生产了。现在，消费资料在全部工业总产值中的比重仍占一半以上，其中纺织工业占工业总产值的第一位，即占四分之一以上；食品工业占第二位，即占五分之一以上。这样就使我们基本上满足了人民物质文化生活的需要，并且在一定限度内提高了人民的物质文化生活水平。
    贾拓夫指出，发展轻工业的生产，不仅是为了满足人民生活的需要，而且可以为国家工业化积累资金。如果把1953到1955这三年间轻工业和纺织工业的工业企业为国家积累的资金集中使用的话，那就可以建设十几个年产五十万吨钢的钢铁厂。而在这个时期，国家投资于轻工业的基本建设经费加上流动资金，还不到上述数字的四分之一，并且，轻工业企业的基本建设一般都在一年以内就能全部收回投资。
    贾拓夫接着说明了轻工业和其他国民经济部门之间的关系。他说，轻工业的发展也是为了配合重工业，农业和其他国民经济建设和发展的需要。拿重工业方面说，如汽车、轮胎、火车、电气仪表等，都有一些轻工业产品作为必不可少的部件或原材料。没有这些轻工业产品配合，这些重工业部门的发展就要受到影响。如果说到轻工业和农业的关系那就更加密切了。轻工业的原材料90％以上来自农业，而大部分的产品又是供应到农村。如果农业收成好，轻工业生产就会得到顺利发展的条件；如果农业收成不好，轻工业生产立刻就要受到影响。总的来说，这几年来农业生产的迅速恢复和发展，大体上保证了轻工业生产所需要的原料供应；反过来，轻工业的发展，又扩大了农产品的加工量，也促进了农业的发展，在目前农业合作化运动和生产的高潮下，如果轻工业生产不能和它相应地发展，那就必然要使农业的发展受到影响。而随着农业生产的发展，农民生活的不断改善，购买力的不断提高，又给轻工业产品提供了广阔的销售市场，促使轻工业提高产量，改进质量，增加花色品种。由于轻工业产品产量的提高，成本的降低，使工农业产品之间的差价已有缩小，粮食、棉花、花生、芝麻、甘蔗等产品换取轻工业品的比价也有提高。1952年，一百斤花生仁只能换白糖二十一斤，换食盐一三○斤，换火柴一六○包，1954年就提高到换白糖二十九斤半，食盐一八二斤多，火柴一七七包。这对提高农民收入、改善农民生活和加强工农联盟都是有很大作用的。
    贾拓夫指出，上述情况说明了轻工业的生产必须在国家总的计划下相应地积极地加以发展，过去已经有了一个相当的发展，但按照国民经济发展的总趋势来说，这还是不够的，今后还应有更多的发展。这样的发展是否违背了优先发展重工业的方针呢？如果这是在有原料、有销路、有生产能力、并且是在国家计划指导之下按比例的发展，而不是盲目的片面的发展，那末，这不但不违背优先发展重工业的方针，恰恰相反，正是有助于优先发展重工业方针的实现，正是为了更多、更快地发展重工业。因为轻工业所积累的资金不断增长，就能更多更快地发展重工业。
    贾拓夫说，我们所说的发展，并不只是讲新建。发展应该有两个方面：新建是一个方面，充分发挥现有企业的生产潜力，包括必需的扩建改建在内，也是一个方面。对轻工业来说，首先是充分发挥现有企业的生产潜力，包括可能的扩建和改建，如果这还不能满足需要，再考虑新建。为了适应第一个五年，特别是第二个五年国民经济发展的需要，在第一个五年内新建一百多个规模较大的轻工纺织业工厂，是完全必要的；在第二个五年，将要有更多的轻工业新建工厂出现。但是，目前更重要的，还是充分发挥现有企业的生产潜力来做到又多、又快、又好、又省地全面地完成和超额完成国家的计划。
    贾拓夫说，在考虑充分发挥现有企业的生产潜力的时候，一定要把各种经济类型的轻工业企业的潜力通盘加以考虑。在轻工业产值方面，属于国营和地方国营企业所生产的，不到一半，属于公私合营、私营和手工业的，占一半以上。大家知道，公私合营和私营企业，以及手工业的潜力要比国营企业大得多。这些企业，在进行社会主义改造后，就得到了发挥其生产潜力的更有利的条件；对这些企业的生产潜力，我们应当通盘考虑进去，统筹兼顾，充分发挥。
    他说，在考虑充分发挥现有企业的生产潜力的时候，还应当把全国各地的企业的生产潜力，通盘加以考虑。内地的企业，要充分发挥其潜力，沿海的企业，也不能加以限制，也应当加以充分合理利用。到目前为止，我国轻工业，大约有70％是在沿海地区，这就是说，现有轻工业的大部分在沿海，它们是发挥现有生产潜力的主体；而且沿海地区的企业，生产技术条件和协作关系，一般比内地为好。发挥沿海地区的企业的潜力，对人民、对国家都有利；这对发展内地工业来说，不但不相矛盾、而且是为了在人力、物力、财力上支援国家在内地建设更多的新厂，以发展内地的工业。
    贾拓夫指出，充分发挥现有企业的潜力，对无论那一个国民经济部门来说，都是十分重要的问题。而对于轻工业来说尤为重要。这是因为在轻工业方面，现有企业的潜力还很大。拿设备利用率来看，一般都还不高，有的很低。至于各个行业中的各个企业，以及各个企业的车间之间，无论在产量、质量和成本等方面，都还有先进落后的差别，而且有些差别很大。如果把落后的都提高到现有的先进的水平，那末就可以为人民为国家生产出更多的更好的产品，积累更多的建设资金。
    贾拓夫举出1955年在全国油脂工业中推广李川江先进榨油法后所收到的成效等具体事例说，把落后的企业提到先进的水平是完全可能的。他说，关键就在于如何充分发挥职工群众的积极性和创造性，如何打破某些领导上的保守主义和官僚主义，使领导和群众相结合，把先进的经验很好总结和推广，帮助落后的提高技术、改善管理，赶上先进的水平。也就是说，要进一步地开展先进生产者运动。
    他指出：在轻工业方面进一步开展先进生产者运动，主要是为了要提高产品质量，降低成本，增加产量和保证生产安全。
    贾拓夫在批评了有些企业的某些产品质量低劣，某些产品质量不稳定的情形以后，特别希望大家重视轻工业产品的质量问题。他说：我们社会主义的工业一定要生产优良的产品；不断改进和提高产品质量是社会主义工业生产的方针问题。这个问题，对于当前的轻工业生产有更迫切的意义。因此，在轻工业方面开展先进生产者运动、劳动竞赛和合理化建议的时候，都应该把改进和提高产品质量当作一项主要任务或主要课题。当然，在提高产品质量的同时，一定也要注意降低成本和增加产量的要求，不能只顾片面地追求质量，不惜工本，以致增加消费者的负担。同时也要经常注意安全生产。
