Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 14th: TASS issued a statement on May 13th regarding the recent meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council.

TASS pointed out that a significant characteristic of this meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council is that it revealed the rotten foundation upon which the entire North Atlantic Group is built. The internal contradictions were particularly sharply manifested at this meeting. The participants had to find ways to conceal the essence of this group. One indication of this was the decision to establish a special committee to prepare recommendations on "ways to improve and expand the non-military cooperation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." The organizers of the North Atlantic Group attempted to give this group an "economic face" to adapt to the changing environment. However, no one, including the organizers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization themselves, would seriously believe the extent to which this military organization could meet the requirements of economic cooperation between countries.

The TASS statement pointed out that just as mutual trust between many countries is beginning to strengthen, their ties are expanding, and these ties are already producing good results, the organizers of the Atlantic Group are seeking new forms to strengthen the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, this military group. This shows that despite the failure of the aggressive policy of the Atlantic Group, the instigators of this organization have not abandoned the "position of strength" policy.

After describing the serious consequences that the establishment of the North Atlantic Group brought to the international situation and the people of the member states of this group, TASS pointed out that to justify this anti-people policy, the participants in this meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council once again trotted out the clichés about the so-called Soviet threat. They also used the pretext of some change in Soviet tactics to defend their policy of attempting to strengthen this military group. However, under the current conditions, wanting to maintain and strengthen the activities of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization contradicts the claim to achieve friendly cooperation and peaceful coexistence among all countries. This action can only show that the militarists are frightened by the policies of peace-loving countries and frightened by the easing of international tensions. They want to get out of their predicament by inciting war mania.

The TASS statement then stated that the situation at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting reflected the serious contradictions between the member states of this group. Representatives of some European countries, because they had to consider the wishes of their own people to strengthen and expand international cooperation, advocated reducing the military expenditure of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, normalizing relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, and taking measures to expand international trade and cultural ties. However, US Secretary of State Dulles insisted on a "strength" policy. Only because the United States exerted crude pressure on other members of the North Atlantic Group, was this group spared from complete disintegration.

The statement concluded by saying that the people of all countries will not be deceived by the rhetoric about preparing to expand the "non-military activities" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This military group was, and still is, an aggressive group that violates the interests of peace. The Soviet Union, like other peace-loving countries, opposes the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It has exposed and will continue to expose the true nature of this organization. The policy of peaceful coexistence and strengthening international cooperation pursued by the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries is gaining the sympathy and support of the people of all countries, and the Soviet people can only express satisfaction with this.

    塔斯社就北大西洋集团理事会会议发表声明
    揭露北大西洋集团内部危机深刻化
    新华社莫斯科14日电　塔斯社在五月十三日就北大西洋公约组织理事会最近一次会议发表了一篇声明。
    塔斯社指出，北大西洋公约组织理事会这次会议的一个重要特点就是，它表明了北大西洋集团的整个建筑是奠立在一个怎样腐朽的基础上。它的内部矛盾在这次会议上特别尖锐地表现了出来。会议的参加者不得不寻找办法来掩饰这个集团的本质。这方面的标志之一就是，会议决定建立一个专门委员会，来准备“有关改进和扩大北大西洋公约组织在非军事方面的合作的方法”的建议。北大西洋集团的组织者企图给这个集团加上一个“经济面貌”，以便适应已经变化的环境，可是，任何人、包括北大西洋公约的组织者自己在内，都不会认真地相信这个军事组织能在什么样的程度上满足各国之间的经济合作的要求。
    塔斯社的声明指出，正当许多国家之间的相互信任开始加强，它们之间的联系日益扩大，而且这种联系已经产生良好结果的时候，大西洋集团的组织者们却在寻找加强北大西洋公约组织这个军事集团的新形式。这就表明，尽管大西洋集团的侵略方针遭到了失败，这个组织的策动者却并没有放弃“实力地位”政策。
    塔斯社在叙述了北大西洋集团的成立给国际局势和这个集团成员国的人民所带来的严重恶果以后指出，为了替这种反人民的政策辩解，北大西洋集团理事会这次会议的参加者又搬出了关于所谓苏联的威胁的滥调。他们还借口什么苏联的策略有了改变来为他们企图加强这个军事集团的政策作辩护。然而，在目前的条件下，想要维持和加强北大西洋公约组织的活动，是跟关于要实现一切国家的友好合作和和平共处的说法相矛盾的。这种行动只能说明，军国主义者被爱好和平的国家的政策吓慌了，被国际紧张局势的缓和吓慌了，他们想借煽动战争狂来摆脱困境。
    塔斯社的声明接着说，北大西洋公约组织理事会会议情况反映出这个集团的成员国之间的严重矛盾。一些欧洲国家的代表由于不得不考虑本国人民要求加强和扩大国际合作的愿望，都主张削减北大西洋公约组织的军费，主张同苏联和人民民主国家关系正常化，主张采取措施扩大国际贸易和文化联系。但是美国国务卿杜勒斯却坚持“实力”政策。只是由于美国对北大西洋集团的其他成员国施加了粗暴的压力，这个集团才得免于完全瓦解。
    这个声明最后说，各国人民是不会被关于准备扩大北大西洋公约组织在“非军事方面”的活动这种花言巧语所欺骗的。这个军事集团过去是，现在仍然是侵略性的违反和平利益的集团。苏联也像其他爱好和平的国家一样，反对北大西洋公约组织。它过去揭穿了，将来仍然要揭穿这个组织的真正性质。苏联和其他爱好和平的国家所执行的和平共处和加强国际合作的政策正在获得各国人民的同情和支持，苏联人对这一点只能表示感到满意。
