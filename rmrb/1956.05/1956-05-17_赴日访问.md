Visiting Japan
Mei Lanfang

In 1919 and 1924, I traveled to Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Kyoto, Takarazuka and other places in Japan for performances. The Japanese people have a great love for, and are very familiar with, our classical dramatic art. In the eyes of the Japanese people, China’s literary and artistic heritage is like something from their own home, and Japanese theater programs originally had many plays based on Chinese stories. Since my two performances in Japan, the Japanese theater world has successively staged many new plays based on Chinese stories, such as "The Heavenly Maid Scatters Flowers," "The Drunken Beauty," "Substitution at the Execution Ground," "The Empty City Stratagem," and so on. At the same time, I also watched many famous Kabuki plays in Japan. Later, famous Japanese actors such as the thirteenth代目 Morita Kanya and Murata Kakuko came to China and performed in Beijing, allowing the Chinese people to see Japanese drama for the first time.

This fact shows that there are many common points in the literature and art of China and Japan. This made me understand why the people of China and Japan are so familiar and close to each other's literature and art.

Last year, the Japanese Kabuki troupe, led by the head of the troupe, Mr. Matsuo Kunizo, and the famous actor Mr. Ichikawa Ennosuke, visited China and performed three of their signature plays, "Kanjincho," "Keisei Kaerimiguruma," and "Futari Dōjōji," which were warmly welcomed by the Chinese people. In particular, "Kanjincho," which they admired most, was also loved by Chinese audiences. In those days, when people met each other in their daily lives, they couldn't help but talk about "Benkei," "Ichikawa Ennosuke," Japanese actors' fans, and so on. Peking Opera actors were especially addicted to watching Kabuki. This is the deep impression left on society after the Japanese Kabuki performance in China last year.

Over the past year, I have received many letters from old Japanese friends and new friends who have recently visited China. They all enthusiastically reflected that the vast number of Japanese people welcome our Chinese Peking Opera Delegation to perform in Japan, which makes me very moved. Now our Chinese Visiting Japan Peking Opera Delegation is about to set off.

After my two visits to Japan, more than thirty years have passed, and now I am participating in this delegation again. This is something that makes me very happy. Because through this visit, not only will Chinese drama be able to meet Japanese audiences extensively on the stage, but I will also be able to reunite and shake hands with Japanese friends I have known for forty years – all the new and old acquaintances.

    赴日访问
    梅兰芳
    在1919年和1924年，我曾经两次到日本的东京、大阪、神户、京都、宝冢等地去旅行演出。日本人民对我国的古典戏剧艺术非常热爱，并且也很熟悉。因为中国文学艺术遗产在日本人民看来就仿佛同自己家里的东西一样，日本的戏剧节目中本来也有很多以中国故事作题材的剧目。自从我两次在日本演出以后，日本戏剧界又陆续上演了许多以中国故事作题材的新剧目，如“天女散花”、“贵妃醉酒”、“法场换子”、“空城计”，等等。我同时也观摩了日本歌舞伎的许多名剧。后来日本的名演员如十三代目守田勘弥、村田嘉久子等来到中国，在北京演出，使中国人民第一次看到了日本戏剧。
    这一事实，说明中日两国的文学艺术有很多的共同点。这使我懂得了中日两国人民，为什么对对方的文学艺术那样地亲切熟悉。
    去年，日本歌舞伎在团长松尾国三先生和著名的演员市川猿之助先生率领下，来中国访问，表演了三出拿手好戏“劝进帐”、“倾城返魂香”和“双蝶道成寺”，受到了中国人民热烈的欢迎，特别是他们自己最欣赏的“劝进帐”，也为中国观众所热爱。在那些日子里，当人们日常生活中彼此见面的时候，不由得就谈到“弁庆”、“市川猿之助”、日本演员的扇子，等等，京剧演员们更是对歌舞伎看上了瘾。这是日本歌舞伎去年来中国表演后在社会上留下的深刻印象。
    一年来我接到许多日本老朋友和最近来华访问的新朋友的信，他们都热烈地反映了日本广大人民欢迎我们中国京剧代表团到日本去演出，使我非常感动。现在我们中国访日京剧代表团，就要启程了。
    我在两次赴日以后，经过了三十多年的岁月，现在又参加这次的代表团。这是使我十分高兴的事。因为通过这次访问，不但使中国戏剧能在舞台上和日本观众广泛见面，并且使我能和四十年来交结的日本朋友——所有的新知故交，又都可以聚首一堂，握手言欢了。
