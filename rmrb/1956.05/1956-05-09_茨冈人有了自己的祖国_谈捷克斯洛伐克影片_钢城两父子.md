The great Russian writer Pushkin and the French classical writer Mérimée both described the life of the Roma people with their genius; from their famous works "The Gypsies" and "Carmen," we are familiar with and understand this nation that wanders around and has no motherland, sympathize with their fate, and love their fiery character that pursues freedom. Now, we meet these Roma people again in the Czechoslovak film "Steel City, Two Fathers." However, there is a clear and profound change here: the Roma people living in the Czechoslovak Republic already have their own motherland, and what unfolds before them is no longer suffering and misfortune, but a beautiful new life full of hope.

The reason why the film "Steel City, Two Fathers" can move us is that it touchingly creates two distinct characters—the Roma man Fabian and his son Geza. In particular, the character of Fabian is depicted by the film with delicate, profound, and colorful artistic power. His experiences, the changes and growth in his character, powerfully demonstrate how a Roma man deeply tormented by the old society becomes an excellent worker in the new society.

Looking at the two scenes of Fabian's first appearance and the ending in the film is quite meaningful. When Fabian first meets us, he is coming to this industrial city with a group of Roma people to find work; the film prominently shows him asking others for street names. Although it is clearly written on the paper in his hand, he is illiterate! The last scene that appears before us is a similar situation, but this time it is some newly arrived Roma people who are asking for directions, and Fabian is the one being asked. Fabian was at that time considering leaving the city because of a temporary misunderstanding (bad elements falsely accused him of damaging the machine), but the scene before him awakened his memories, causing him to repeatedly think about these questions: Who made him become a worker with culture and knowledge? Can he leave this new life and his comrades who care for him infinitely? After inner struggle, Fabian decided to return to the factory. The film has no superfluous dialogue and description, but it shows Fabian's thoughts and feelings at the time from this plot.

These two scenes are not isolated and unrelated, but echo each other and contrast with each other. Like blood vessels, it runs through the entire body of the film, embodying the creators' complete and rigorous concept—how Fabian grows into a worker with ideological awareness. "Steel City, Two Fathers" is precisely closely centered on Fabian's fate, and through typical events and plots, gradually and deeply shows his inner world. His pain and laughter, the remnants of the old consciousness reflected in him and the victory of new ideas, are all intimate and closely related to us.

After Fabian goes to work in the factory, the new life attracts him. The film reflects Fabian's pursuit of new things through such a seemingly ordinary event. When he receives his salary for the first time, Fabian feels very uncomfortable because he cannot sign his name on the receipt. Therefore, after he gets his salary, the first thing he thinks of is to buy a pen. He said to the electric welder Troyan, who patiently helped him: "People... should all have a pen!" Obviously, for Fabian, this is not an arbitrary act, but a very meaningful new thing in life.

At the same time, in the process of his growth, the film does not simply deal with the character of Fabian. The imprint left on him by the long life in the old society will not disappear all at once. For example, when Fabian has money and goes to the bar, he can't resist the temptation to drink heavily again; yes, the old things still strongly affect him! However, the film does not take a cold, objective attitude to depict these shortcomings in Fabian—his distrust of people, alcoholism, and lack of culture are all caused by certain social and historical reasons. Moreover, new ideas have increasingly grown in his heart and have become the dominant force driving him forward.

It is on this issue that people's two different attitudes are reflected. Some people believe that the Roma people are inherently backward, and it is impossible to help them overcome these shortcomings. However, Troyan and the female teacher Furashta deeply understand that as long as they are warmly and patiently cared for, and helped to master cultural and scientific knowledge, they can open their eyes that have been blinded, so that they can become useful builders. Undoubtedly, this plot in the film is effective for the depiction of Fabian's character development and for the excavation of the theme.

Next, the film further reveals Fabian's character through the event that Fabian moves into a new house and Troyan and the female teacher promise to attend the celebration party, but do not go for some reason. When dealing with such a plot, the film does not generally make a superficial explanation of the new life, but through the conflict of life, more deeply portrays the characters. At that time, how much Fabian hoped that Troyan and others could attend the celebration party! He busily and happily prepared. This not only reflected his respect and love for Troyan and others, but also, in Fabian's heart, there was already a sense of national self-esteem: Today, people have begun to respect the Roma! Although the fact that Troyan and the female teacher happened not to attend the party as shown in the film is not the most reasonable, the psychological changes of Fabian shown in this event are of characteristic significance. We see how he develops from pleasant expectations to eager waiting, to disappointment, pain, and finally even anger. When another Roma man asked who he was saving the wine for, he said sadly and painfully: "No, it's for us to drink!" Naturally, this is a misunderstanding with an accidental nature, but the event itself criticizes Troyan's breach of promise, made a mistake in this regard, and also sharply reflects the psychological state of this Roma man, who thought that people like Troyan were not really respecting the Roma.

The moving power of the film "Steel City, Two Fathers" is precisely due to its ability to truly portray the protagonist's thoughts and feelings in sharp contradictions and struggles. The film also uses the most prominent scenes, and even adopts a character monologue that is very difficult for film to handle, to show the psychological state of Fabian being falsely accused by bad elements of damaging the machine. The grievances and excitement in the character's heart develop step by step, and when he says: "Your (referring to the female teacher) eyes are very bright. You can see everything! You can see who copied and who didn't copy... But I, the inner pain of the Roma, you didn't see... They all say that Roma people lie. But the Roma man said: 'That machine is not... not what I damaged'. Those people insisted: 'Roma man, you are lying!' They won't lie! Never lie!" At this time, his pain, his kind and upright heart, are so purely exposed before our eyes, can this not arouse our deep sympathy for him?

From these aspects, the film "Steel City, Two Fathers" completes the creation of the character of Fabian. From the development of his character, we not only know his thoughts and feelings today, but also see from him the traces that life experiences have left on his heart. This is a vivid and typical character.

The little Roma man Geza in this film also makes a relatively deep impression. We see how he changes from a child who is afraid of going to school and has an stubborn temperament to a Young Pioneer wearing a red scarf. In particular, his leaping progress is explained through a conflict with his father. Fabian once wanted to copy his homework (the two of them were studying culture in the same class). At first, because of his fear of his father, he hesitated for a while, but immediately resolutely said: "...Copying is not right, this is cheating, it's like someone invented something and it was stolen by someone else." Even if Fabian angrily beat him, he did not waver. This is because he has been less affected by the old influences on the road to progress in life, so his development is much simpler than Fabian's.

"Steel City, Two Fathers" is a film of great significance. Just as the Roma people in the film recite Gorky's famous saying "Man is a lofty title" in class, the film praises the Roma people who suffered torture and humiliation in the old society, and today they have regained the dignity of being a person and are moving towards a new life in the posture of a new person.

　　茨冈人有了自己的祖国
　　——谈捷克斯洛伐克影片“钢城两父子”

    伟大的俄罗斯作家普希金、法国古典作家梅里美都曾以他们天才的笔调，描写过茨冈人的生活；从他们的著名作品“茨冈”和“嘉尔曼”中，我们熟悉了、认识了这个四处流浪、没有祖国的民族，同情他们的命运，并且喜爱着他们那种追求自由的火热性格。现在，我们从捷克斯洛伐克的影片“钢城两父子”中，又同这些茨冈人见面了。但是，在这里却有着一个鲜明的深刻的变化：生活在捷克斯洛伐克共和国的茨冈人，已经有了自己的祖国，展开在他们面前的也不再是苦难和不幸，而是美好的、充满了希望的新生活。
    影片“钢城两父子”所以能够激动我们，在于它动人地创造了两个鲜明的形象——茨冈人法比安和他的儿子盖扎。特别是法比安这个人物，被影片以细腻的、深刻的、多采的艺术力量描绘出来了。他的遭遇，他的性格上的变化和成长，有力地表现出一个深受旧社会折磨的茨冈人，怎样在新社会里成为一个优秀的劳动者。
    看一看影片中法比安第一次出现和结尾的那两个场景，是颇有深意的。当法比安初次和我们相见的时候，他正和一群茨冈人一起到这个工业城市来找工作；影片突出地表现了他向别人打听路名的事。虽然他手中的纸条上写得明明白白，他却是一字不识啊！影片最后出现在我们眼前的是一个相似的情景，不过，这一次问路的是一些新来的茨冈人，法比安却是被询问者了。法比安当时由于受到人们一时的误解（坏分子诬告他弄坏了机器），正想离开这个城市，但是，眼前的情形，唤醒了他的回忆，使他反复地思索着这些问题：是谁使自己变成为一个有文化有知识的工人的呢？自己能离开这种新生活和无限关怀他的同志们吗？经过内心的斗争，法比安决定回到工厂中去。影片没有多余的对话和描写，却从这一情节中，表现了法比安当时的思想情感。
    这两个场景不是孤立的、互不联系的，而是前后呼应、相互对照的。它像血管似地贯串在整个影片的躯体中，体现了创作者们一个完整的严密的构思——法比安怎样成长为一个具有思想觉悟的工人。“钢城两父子”正是紧紧围绕着法比安的命运，通过典型的事件和情节，逐步深入地展现了他的内心世界。他的痛苦和欢笑，他身上所反映出来的旧意识的残余和新思想的胜利，对我们都是亲切的、息息相关的。
    法比安到工厂工作以后，新的生活吸引住了他。影片通过这样一件看来极为平常的事件，反映了法比安对于新事物的追求。当第一次领取薪水的时候，法比安因为不会在收据上签自己的名字，心中很难受。因此，在他拿到薪水以后，首先想到的就是要买一支钢笔。他对耐心帮助他的电焊工人特洛扬说：“人……都应该有一支笔啊！”显然，对于法比安来说，这不是一种随意的举动，而是一件很有意义的生活中的新事情。
    同时，在他的成长过程中，影片也并没有简单地来处理法比安这个人物形象。长期的旧社会的生活在他身上所留下的烙印，并不是一下就会消失掉的。例如，当法比安有了钱到酒吧间去后，竟又受不住诱惑大喝起来；是的，旧的一切还是那么强烈地影响着他！但是，影片不是采取一种冷淡的客观主义的态度来描绘法比安身上这些缺点的——他对人们的不信任，酗酒，没有文化，都是由于一定的社会和历史原因所造成的。并且，新的思想已经日益在他的心中生长起来了，成为了推动他前进的主导力量。
    正是在这一问题上，反映了人们的两种不同的态度。有些人认为茨冈人天生就是落后的，要想帮助他们去克服这些缺点是不可能的。但是，特洛扬和女教师甫拉斯塔却深深懂得：只要热情耐心地关怀他们，并且帮助他们去掌握文化科学知识，就能打开他们一直被蒙蔽着的眼光，使他们成为有用的建设者。无疑，影片中的这一情节，对于法比安性格发展的描绘，对于主题思想的发掘，都是有作用的。
    接着，影片通过法比安搬入新居，特洛扬和女教师答应去参加庆祝晚会、而因故又没有去这一事件，进一步揭示了法比安的性格。影片在处理这样的情节时，并不是一般地对新生活作一个表面的说明，而是通过生活的冲突，更深入地去刻划人物。当时，法比安是多么期望特洛扬等能去参加这个庆祝晚会呵！他忙碌地兴高采烈地准备着。这不仅反映了他对特洛扬等的敬爱，而且，在法比安的心中已经有了一种民族自尊感：今天，人们已经尊重起茨冈人来了！虽然，影片所表现的特洛扬和女教师竟凑巧地都没有去参加晚会这件事，还不是最合情理的，但是，在这一事件中所表现出来的法比安的心理变化，却是具有特征意义的。我们看到他怎样从愉快的期望到急切的等待，以至发展到失望、痛苦，最后甚至愤怒起来。当另一位茨冈人问到把酒留给谁喝的时候，他难过地、沉痛地说：“不，是咱们自己喝的！”自然，这是一场带有偶然性质的误会，但是，事件的本身正批判了特洛扬他们的失言，在这一点上犯下了一个错误，并且，也尖锐地反映了这个茨冈人的心理状态，他以为，原来像特洛扬这样的人也并不是真正尊重茨冈人的。
    影片“钢城两父子”的动人力量，正由于它善于在尖锐的矛盾斗争中，来真实地刻划主人公的思想情感。影片也正是以最突出的场面，甚至采取了对于电影来说很不容易处理的人物独白，表现了法比安受到坏分子诬告他损坏机器的心理状态。人物内心中的委屈、激动一步步地发展着，当他说到：“你（指女教师）的眼睛很亮。你全看得见！你能看见，谁是抄来的，谁没抄……可是，我，茨冈的内心痛苦，你没有看见……他们全都说茨冈人说谎。可是，茨冈他说：‘那个机器不是……不是我弄坏的’。那些人硬说：‘茨冈人你说谎！’他们不会说谎！从来不说谎！”这时，他的痛苦，他的一颗善良正直的心，是多么纯朴地坦露在我们的眼前，这能不激起我们对他的深切同情吗？
    从这些方面，影片“钢城两父子”完成了法比安这个人物形象的创造，我们从他的性格发展中，不仅熟悉了他今天的思想感情，而且，从他的身上，也看到了生活经历在他心灵上所留下的痕迹。这是一个活生生的、富有典型意义的人物。
    这一影片中的小茨冈盖扎给人印象也是比较深刻的。我们看到他怎样从一个害怕上学、性情执拗的孩子，变成了一个挂上红领巾的少先队员。特别是通过他和父亲的一场冲突，说明了他的飞跃的进步。法比安有一次要抄他的作业（他们两父子都在同一个班上学文化）。开始由于对父亲的畏惧，他犹疑了一下，但立即坚决地说：“……抄是不应该的，这是欺骗，这就像有个人发明了东西，被另外人偷去了一样。”即使法比安生气地责打他，他也毫不动摇。这是因为在生活前进的道路上，他所受的旧影响较少，所以他的发展也就比法比安要单纯得多。
    “钢城两父子”是一部具有重要意义的影片。正如影片中茨冈人在上课时所念到的高尔基的名言“人是崇高的称号”一样，影片颂扬了在旧社会受尽折磨、凌辱的茨冈人，今天重又获得了作为一个人的庄严，并以一个新人的姿态向新生活前进。
