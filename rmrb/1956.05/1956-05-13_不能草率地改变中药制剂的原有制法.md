To the Editor:

    I am an employee of the Tonghanchun Traditional Chinese Medicine Pharmacy. I want to express an opinion to you: The Shanghai Municipal Company of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation has changed the original operating regulations for prepared medicines without careful research, which will seriously affect the quality and therapeutic effects of the medicines. I have raised my concerns with the relevant departments, but they have not received due attention.

    The method used by Tonghanchun Traditional Chinese Medicine Pharmacy for making donkey-hide gelatin (Ejiao) is as follows: first, scrape both sides of the donkey skin clean, rinse and dry it in the sun, and then boil it after half a year. The advantage of this method is that it reduces the fishy smell and improves the quality. The Hangzhou Hu Qing Yu Tang Traditional Chinese Medicine Pharmacy also operates in this way, and is therefore popular with customers. However, the pharmaceutical company now entrusts our store to process 3,000 donkey hides by scraping and boiling them immediately, and only scraping the hairy side, leaving the rotting flesh on the inside unscraped. The pharmaceutical company wants to do this to increase the gelatin yield. Admittedly, the gelatin yield is increased; however, if rotten meat is boiled into the gelatin, it may deteriorate and smell bad when the weather gets hot, and the quality of the donkey-hide gelatin will inevitably be greatly affected.

    Renshen Zaizao Wan (Ginseng Reconstructive Pill) is a popular medicine for dispelling wind, promoting blood circulation, and treating muscle and bone pain. In 1954, Tonghanchun Traditional Chinese Medicine Pharmacy sold 150,000 pills per month. However, how does the pharmaceutical company treat the production of this medicine? The Renshen Zaizao Wan they purchased from our store in February and March all lacked *Quanxie* (scorpion). The reason given was that *Quanxie* was in short supply and it was not very important for prepared medicines generally taken as tonics. In fact, *Quanxie* is one of the important medicines in Renshen Zaizao Wan, and this reason is incorrect.

    Not only that, the pharmaceutical company often uses the urgency of the task as an excuse to neglect operational quality. Sometimes the *Quanxie* in Renshen Zaizao Wan was used without being rinsed and the *Hupo* (amber) was used without being water-ground. The *Huangqin* (Scutellariae Radix) in Sanhuang Wan (Three Yellow Pill) purchased in January was not soaked in boiling water.

    The situation of traditional Chinese medicine preparations is relatively complicated, and there are still no unified standards for the preparation methods of many medicines. To change the preparation method of certain medicines, it must be done very carefully in order to maintain and develop the original advantages in the manufacturing of traditional Chinese medicine. The Shanghai Municipal Pharmaceutical Company's rash approach is wrong and should be corrected quickly.

### 不能草率地改变中药制剂的原有制法

    不能草率地改变中药制剂的原有制法编辑同志：
    我是童涵春国药号的一个职工。我要向你们反映一个意见：中国药材公司上海市公司没有经过郑重研究就随便改变原有成药的操作配合规定，这将严重地影响药品质量和治疗效果。我已经向有关方面提出过意见，但是并没有引起应有的重视。
    童涵春国药号制作驴皮胶的制法是：先将驴皮两面铲清，漂净晒干后等半年再煎；这样制作的优点是腥气少，质地好。杭州胡庆余堂国药号也是这样操作的，因而受到顾客的欢迎。而现在药材公司委托本店加工三千张驴皮是马上铲、马上煎，而且只把有毛一面铲清，里面有腐肉一面不铲。药材公司要这样做的理由是提高出胶率。固然，出胶率是提高了；但是腐肉煎进胶内，天气热了就有变质发臭的可能，驴皮胶的质量必然大受影响。
    人参再造丸是一种祛风、活血、治筋骨酸痛的畅销药品，1954年童涵春国药号每月销售数达十五万粒。但是，药材公司怎样对待这种药品的制作工作呢？他们在二、三月份向本店收购的人参再造丸都缺放全蝎。理由是全蝎缺货，而且对于一般作为补品服用的成药关系不大。实际上全蝎是人参再造丸的重要药品之一，这样的理由是不对的。
    不仅如此，药材公司常常以任务紧为理由，忽视操作质量。有时人参再造丸中的全蝎没有漂过、琥珀没有用水飞过就用了，一月份收购的三黄丸中黄芩也没有用开水泡过。
    中药制剂的情况比较复杂，有许多药品的制法还没有统一标准。要改变某些药品的制法，必须十分慎重，以利于保持并发扬国药制造中的原有优点。上海市药材公司这样草率从事的做法是不对的，应该迅速纠正。
