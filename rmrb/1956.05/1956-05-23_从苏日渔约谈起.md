    Starting from the Soviet-Japanese Fishery Negotiations
    Li Chunqing
    After half a month of negotiations, the Soviet-Japanese Fishery Treaty and the Maritime Rescue Agreement were signed in Moscow on the morning of May 14.

    Before Ichiro Kono went to Moscow, the Japanese Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party had made resolutions, only allowing Kono to negotiate fishery issues and forbidding him from touching on the issue of Soviet-Japanese diplomatic relations. We know that in Japan there is a faction—mainly the former Yoshida faction—that firmly opposes dealing with the Soviet Union, fearing that Kono's visit to the Soviet Union would lead to good results.

    On May 12, when the Soviet-Japanese Fishery Treaty was said to be about to be signed but was not, American officials declared with extreme satisfaction that the Soviet-Japanese fishery negotiations had broken down, while hinting that Japan should not make concessions.

    However, the signing of the Soviet-Japanese Fishery Treaty disappointed those who hoped for the failure of the negotiations.

    Soviet-Japanese fishery relations are a complex issue with historical disputes. According to the Treaty of Portsmouth signed in 1905, due to Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War, it obtained an imperialist privilege in Russian territorial waters—fishing rights. After the October Revolution, the Soviet Union and Japan held fishery negotiations in Moscow in 1925, and signed the Soviet-Japanese Fishery Treaty in May 1928. In August 1932, a provisional agreement on fishing zones was concluded. According to this agreement, Japan obtained 371 salmon and trout fishing zones and 21 crab fishing zones along the coasts of Kamchatka and the Sea of Okhotsk. However, due to the insatiable greed and unreasonable behavior of Japanese imperialism, disputes constantly arose with the Soviet Union in all aspects, such as fishing zone issues, fishing quantities, and fishing methods, and Soviet-Japanese fishery relations invariably became tense every year. After Japan's surrender in 1945, Japan's fishing rights in Soviet territorial waters were naturally lost. At the same time, Japan's fishing in the high seas was also restricted. It was not until 1952 that Japan resumed North Pacific fisheries. The so-called North Pacific includes 1.3 million square nautical miles of sea area in the Bering Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the northern part of the Sea of Japan, of which 530,000 square nautical miles are fishing grounds. In 1955, Japan caught 64 million salmon and trout in the North Pacific, and the resources of North Pacific fish were severely threatened.

    Salmon and trout are fish that eat fish, specializing in eating small fish, crustaceans, and insects; they are cold-water fish that hatch in water around 10 degrees Celsius; from May to September each year, they swim upstream from the river mouths, only spawning in the rivers, not in the sea. Those large and small rivers flowing into the Bering Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Sea of Japan on Soviet territory are all spawning grounds for salmon and trout. Because Japan overfishes in the North Pacific, not only does Soviet fishery suffer great losses, but it also affects the future yield of North Pacific salmon and trout. On March 21 this year, in order to protect salmon and trout resources, the Soviet government announced a limit on the fishing volume in the North Pacific fishing zone to 25 million fish. Japan, only caring about immediate interests and emphasizing the freedom of fishing in the high seas, plans to catch 100 million fish in the North Pacific this year, an increase of about 60% compared to last year, preferring to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.

    We understand the importance of fisheries to Japan. The Japanese people consume millions of tons of fish every year, and a large portion of the protein they need for nutrition comes from seafood. In addition to being eaten, fish is also used in Japan as fertilizer, for crafts, and for medicine. Fisheries are also one of Japan's sources of foreign exchange, and Japan now exports about 70 million US dollars worth of aquatic products annually. Before the war, Japan's fishery ranked first in the world, with active fishing grounds extending north to the Bering Strait, south to Australia, and west to the Indian Ocean, accounting for one-third of the world's fishing grounds; the annual catch reached 5 million tons, accounting for 40% of the world's fish catch. However, in the Second World War, Japan lost 300,000 tons of fishing boats, and the fishery suffered a certain setback. In recent years, Japan's fishery has been restored and developed. According to statistics at the end of 1953, Japan had 230,000 tons more powered fishing boats than in 1939 before the war. The fish production in 1952 had exceeded the average production of 1933-1935 by 56.8%.

    Because of the importance of fishery to Japan, after the Soviet Union announced the restriction of fishing in the North Pacific, the Japanese people, especially the fishermen related to the North Pacific fishery, demanded that the Japanese government negotiate with the Soviet government. According to practice, Japanese North Pacific fishery usually starts fishing in mid-May. In fact, when Kono went to Moscow, Japanese North Pacific fishing boats had already sailed to the North Pacific. Therefore, Japan urgently needed to conduct fishery negotiations, at least to solve the problem of North Pacific fishing this year. Under such circumstances, regardless of whether some people in Japan opposed the negotiations, or how unwilling the United States was to this negotiation, Ichiro Kono, as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry and bearing important responsibility for fisheries, had no choice but to go to Moscow with a realistic attitude. And the result of the negotiation proves that no matter how different their social systems and ideologies are, as long as both sides have the sincerity to solve the problem, they can solve the problem and reach an agreement through negotiation based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. For example, in the Moscow negotiations, regarding the issue of fishing volume, Japan advocated 80,000 tons, the Soviet Union advocated 50,000 tons, and as a result of consultation, the temporary agreement stipulated that the fishing volume this year would be 65,000 tons. Moreover, this temporary agreement came into effect immediately on the date of signing. Such a solution to the problem is not only reasonable, but also demonstrates a spirit of mutual understanding and mutual compromise.

    As far as fisheries are concerned, the problems between the Soviet Union and Japan have now been resolved. The agreement on the Yellow Sea and East China Sea fisheries between China and Japan was signed by the corresponding organizations of the two countries as early as April 15 last year, and on May 8 this year, both parties agreed to extend the validity of the agreement for another year. The international trade organization of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea also wrote to Japan on May 12 this year, expressing its hope to conduct consultations on fishery issues. The countries of the socialist camp hope for the prosperity of Japanese fishery. But what are the attitudes of South Korea and the United States, which are related to Japanese fishery, towards Japan? Before the war, Japan's fishing off the coast of Korea reached 1.5 million tons. This fishing ground is important to Japan. However, on February 18, 1952, South Korea unilaterally announced the so-called "Syngman Rhee Line," prohibiting Japan from crossing the line to fish. Since then, many Japanese fishing boats have been captured and many Japanese fishermen have been detained, and the problem has not been resolved. In the central Pacific fishing zone, famous for its skipjack and tuna production, the United States is testing hydrogen bombs there, and a large area has been designated as a dangerous area prohibited from fishing. In March 1954, due to the harm of the US hydrogen bomb test, twenty-three people on the Japanese fishing boat Fukuryu Maru were injured, and Aikichi Kuboyama died of poisoning. That test also forced Japan to discard more than 80 million pounds of tuna contaminated with radioactivity and had to bury them in the ground. The US government, disregarding the strong opposition of the Japanese people, is now conducting a series of hydrogen bomb tests in the central Pacific. Japan has lost a large amount of skipjack and tuna, which are necessary for seasoning, and suffers from tasteless food, but to fish in the central Pacific, fishermen must risk their lives.

    After the signing of the Soviet-Japanese Fishery Treaty, the United States has begun a tone of blaming Japan and is putting pressure on Japan. Because the Soviet-Japanese Fishery Treaty and the Maritime Rescue Agreement both stipulate that they "shall come into effect from the date of entry into force of the peace treaty or from the date of restoration of Soviet-Japanese diplomatic relations." At the same time, the joint communiqué stipulates: "Negotiations on the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations shall be resumed no later than July 31." This means that the Soviet-Japanese Fishery Treaty has already brought about the issue of restoring Soviet-Japanese diplomatic relations. Because the United States is afraid of the development of Soviet-Japanese relations; Japan is afraid of offending the United States, so Ichiro Kono is now rushing from Moscow to Washington to explain.

    The Japanese government is now facing a major test. Will it succumb to the opinions of the United States, or will it take an independent and autonomous path? Everyone knows that the negotiations on the restoration of Soviet-Japanese diplomatic relations have been held in London for twenty-three meetings, and ten agreements have been reached on the draft Soviet-Japanese peace treaty. Except for the last territorial issue that has not been resolved, all other issues have been resolved. If the Japanese government had not actively recalled the negotiating representative Toshikazu Matsumoto, perhaps the negotiations on the restoration of diplomatic relations would have been successful. The negotiations on the restoration of Soviet-Japanese diplomatic relations should be resumed. The Soviet Union has stated that it is not anxious and can wait. The negotiations on the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations cannot be said to be just the Soviet Union's request, but should be said to be Japan's request. It is impossible to just want fishing and not diplomatic relations. Moreover, the fishery issue is only one of the practical issues between the Soviet Union and Japan, and there are many outstanding issues that need to be consulted frequently. The Japanese government cannot imagine that legally the Soviet Union and Japan continue to exist in a state of war, and the two countries have no formal diplomatic exchanges, and can solve many problems one by one. It is said that the Soviet government has clearly stated that it can sign the Soviet-Japanese peace treaty, the so-called "London method"; it can also announce the end of the state of war, the so-called "Adenauer method"; the Japanese government can choose either method. Can the Japanese government have any reason to refuse? During the Moscow negotiations, the Kyodo News Agency conducted individual interviews with 2,500 Japanese men and women citizens as a public opinion survey. The result was that more than half of the people hoped to restore Soviet-Japanese diplomatic relations as soon as possible. Can the current Japanese government be irresponsible to the Japanese voters? Whether it is for the benefit of the Japanese nation or to promote a more moderate international situation, the Japanese government cannot avoid the issue of the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations.

    从苏日渔约谈起
    李纯青
    经过半个月的谈判，五月十四日早晨，苏日渔业条约和海上营救协定在莫斯科签字了。
    在河野一郎赴莫斯科以前，日本内阁和自由民主党都做过决议，只许河野谈判渔业问题，不准他碰到苏日邦交问题。我们知道，在日本有那么一派人——以旧吉田派为主，他们坚决反对和苏联打交道，唯恐河野赴苏谈判谈出好的结果来。
    五月十二日，说苏日渔业条约将要签字而没有签字，那天晚上，美国官员极其满意地宣称：苏日渔业谈判破裂了，同时暗示着叫日本不要作出让步。
    但是苏日渔业条约的签订使那些希望谈判失败的人们失望了。
    苏日渔业关系是一个有历史纠纷的复杂问题。根据1905年签订的朴茨茅斯和约，由于日本在日俄战争中获胜，它在俄国领海内得到一种帝国主义的特权——渔业权。十月革命后，1925年苏日两国曾在莫斯科举行渔业谈判，1928年5月签订苏日渔业条约。1932年8月又缔结渔区暂行协定。根据这个协定，日本在堪察加和鄂霍次克海沿岸，取得了鲑鳟渔区371处，蟹渔区21处。但是由于日本帝国主义贪得无餍而蛮不讲理，在渔区问题、捕鱼数量以及捕鱼方法等各方面，不断和苏联发生纠纷，每年必有一度苏日渔业关系陷于紧张。1945年日本投降以后，日本对苏联领海的渔业权当然丧失了。同时，日本在公海捕鱼也受到限制。直到1952年，日本才恢复北洋渔业。所谓北洋，包括白令海、鄂霍次克海和日本海北部一百三十万平方浬海域，其中有五十三万平方浬是可以捕鱼的渔场。1955年，日本在北洋捕获了鲑鱼和鳟鱼六千四百万条，北洋鱼的资源受到严重的威胁。
    鲑和鳟是一种吃鱼的鱼，专吃小鱼介和昆虫；它是冷水性的鱼族，在摄氏十度上下的水中孵化；每年五月至九月，由河口溯河而上，只在河中产卵，不在海里产卵。在苏联领土上的流入白令海、鄂霍次克海和日本海的那些大小河道，都是鲑鳟鱼的产卵场所。因为日本在北洋滥行捕鱼，不但苏联渔业受到很大的损失。而且影响到今后北洋鲑鳟鱼类的产量。今年三月二十一日，苏联政府为了保护鲑鳟的资源，宣布限制北洋渔区捕鱼量为二千五百万条。而日本只顾眼前利益，强调公海捕鱼自由，今年计划在北海捕鱼一万万条，比去年约增加60％，他们宁愿杀鸡取卵。
    我们理解渔业对日本的重要性。日本人民每年食用鱼类达数百万吨，他们营养所需的蛋白质，很大部分是从鱼鲜得来。除食用以外，鱼在日本还作肥料、工艺用和药用。渔业又是日本取得外汇的来源之一，现在日本每年出口水产物约值七千万美元。战前日本渔业居世界第一位，活动的渔场北至白令海峡，南至澳洲，西至印度洋，占世界渔场三分之一；每年捕鱼量达五百万吨，占世界捕鱼量的40％。但在第二次大战中，日本损失渔船三十万吨，渔业受到一定的挫折。及至最近几年，日本渔业已经得到恢复和发展。据1953年底统计，日本所有动力渔船已比战前1939年增多二十三万吨。1952年的鱼产量已超过1933—1935年平均产量56.8％。
    因为渔业对于日本的重要，在苏联宣布限制北洋捕鱼以后，日本人民特别是和北洋渔业有关的渔民纷纷要求日本政府和苏联政府进行谈判。按照惯例，日本北洋渔业每年在五月中旬就开始捕鱼。事实上，在河野前往莫斯科的时候，日本北洋渔船已经驶往北洋去了。因此，日本急需进行渔业谈判，至少必须解决今年北洋捕鱼的问题。在这种情况下，不管日本国内有人反对谈判，也不管美国对这个谈判多么不乐意，身为农林相、对渔业负有重要责任的河野一郎就不能不怀着现实的态度到莫斯科去。而谈判结果证明：不管彼此社会制度和思想意识怎样不同，只要双方都具有解决问题的诚意，按照平等互利的原则，通过谈判是能够解决问题，达成协议的。例如在莫斯科谈判中，关于捕鱼量的问题，日本主张八万吨，苏联主张五万吨，而协商结果，临时协定规定今年捕鱼量为六万五千吨。而且这个临时协定在签字之日立即生效。这样解决问题不但是合理的，而且还表现着互相谅解、互相让步的精神。
    就渔业方面来说，现在苏日之间的问题已经解决了。中日之间关于黄海东海渔业问题早于去年四月十五日由两国相应团体签订协定，今年五月八日双方又同意协定延长有效期一年。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国际贸易团体在今年五月十二日也写信给日本，表示希望进行有关渔业问题的协商。社会主义阵营国家是希望日本渔业繁荣的。但是和日本渔业有关的南韩和美国对待日本的态度又是怎样呢？战前日本在朝鲜沿海捕鱼曾达一百五十万吨。这方面的渔场对日本是重要的。但是1952年2月18日南韩片面宣布所谓“李承晚线”，禁止日本越线捕鱼，从此以后，许多日本渔船被捉去，许多日本渔民被扣押，而问题不得解决。以出产鲣鱼和鲔鱼著名的中太平洋渔区，美国在那里试验氢弹，很大范围被划为禁止捕鱼的危险区域。1954年3月，由于美国试验氢弹的祸害，日本渔船福龙丸二十三人受伤，久保山爱吉中毒致死，那次试验还使日本抛弃已经捕到的八千多万磅染有放射能的鲔鱼，不得不把它们埋到地里。美国政府不顾日本人民的强烈反对，现在正在中太平洋进行一系列的氢弹试验。日本大量丧失调味所必需的鲣鲔鱼，苦于食而无味，但是要到中太平洋捕鱼，渔民须冒生命的危险。
    在苏日渔业条约签字以后，美国已经开始一种责备日本的论调，正在对日本施加压力。因为苏日渔业条约和海上营救协定都规定“从和约生效之日起或者苏日外交关系恢复之日起开始生效。”同时在联合公报中规定：“不迟于七月三十一日恢复苏日关系正常化的谈判。”这就是说，苏日渔业条约已经带来了恢复苏日邦交问题。因为美国是害怕苏日关系发展的；日本则害怕得罪美国，所以现在河野一郎又赶快从莫斯科到华盛顿去进行解释。
    日本政府现已面临重大的考验，究竟是屈从美国的意见呢，还是走独立自主的道路？大家知道，恢复苏日邦交的谈判，已在伦敦举行过二十三次会议，对苏日和约草案已达成十条协议，除了最后一个领土问题没有解决以外，其它问题都解决了。如果不是日本政府主动调回谈判代表松本俊一，也许恢复邦交的谈判已经成功。苏日恢复邦交谈判是应该恢复的。苏联曾经声明过，它并不焦急，它是能够等待的。恢复苏日关系正常化的谈判不能说只是苏联的要求，应该说更是日本的要求。只要捕鱼，不要邦交，那是行不通的。而且渔业问题只是苏日之间现实问题之一，悬而未决的和经常需要协商的问题还很多。日本政府不能设想在法律上苏日继续存在着战争状态，两国没有正式的外交往来，而可以把许多问题一一加以解决。据说苏联政府已经明白表示：可以签订苏日和约，即所谓“伦敦方式”；也可以宣布结束战争状态，即所谓“阿登纳方式”；两种方式任由日本政府选择。难道日本政府能有理由可以拒绝吗？在莫斯科谈判期间，共同通讯社曾向二千五百个日本男女公民进行过个别谈话，作为民意测验，结果是过半数的人，希望尽快地恢复苏日邦交。难道日本现政府能对日本选民不负责任吗？不论为了日本国家的利益，或是为了促进国际形势更加和缓，日本政府都不能逃避苏日关系正常化的问题。
