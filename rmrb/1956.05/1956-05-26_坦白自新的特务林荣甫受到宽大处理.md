Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, May 25th. The Xiamen Municipal People's Procuratorate announced at a mass meeting of nearly a thousand people on the 23rd that special agent Lin Rongfu, who had confessed his crimes and showed genuine remorse, would be given lenient treatment and exempted from prosecution.

　　Lin Rongfu had been a special agent for the "Central Bureau" and the "Kuomintang Xiamen Municipal Party Department Action Group" before liberation. After liberation, he fled to Hong Kong and was later appointed by the Chiang Kai-shek spy agency "National Security Bureau Intelligence Bureau" as "Xiamen Station Group Leader." In late October 1955, he sneaked back to the mainland to engage in activities to gather military intelligence. After sneaking into the mainland, Lin Rongfu sent intelligence to the Hong Kong spy agency once. However, due to the people's strict precautions, his activities became difficult. In addition, he personally witnessed the achievements of the motherland's socialist construction, was moved by the lenient policy of the People's Government, and persuaded by his family, he finally confessed and repented to the People's Government.

　　After being leniently exempted from prosecution, Lin Rongfu gratefully expressed that he would start a new life and repay the People's Government's leniency with practical actions of abiding by the law.

    坦白自新的特务林荣甫受到宽大处理
    新华社福州25日电　厦门市人民检察院二十三日在近千人的大会上宣布给坦白了自己罪行并且确有悔悟表现的特务分子林荣甫以宽大处理，对他免予起诉。
    林荣甫在解放前就曾经是“中统”“国民党厦门市党部行动组”的特务分子。解放后跑到香港，后来又受蒋介石特务机关“国家安全局情报局”的委派为“厦门站组长”，1955年10月下旬潜回大陆，进行刺探军事情报的活动。林荣甫潜入大陆以后，曾经向香港特务机关送过一次情报，但后来由于人民的严密防范，使他活动困难，加上他亲眼看到祖国社会主义建设的成就以及人民政府宽大政策的感召和他的家属的劝说，终于向人民政府坦白自新。
    林荣甫在受到免予起诉的宽大处理后，感激地表示今后要重新做人，以安分守法的实际行动来报答人民政府对他的宽大。
