    Li Xingrui Hook-Up Team Achieves Long-Term Safe Production
    The Li Xingrui hook-up team of the Jiawang Coal Mine eliminated major accidents and all kinds of responsibility accidents and maintained safe production for a long period from May 1950 to March 1956, a period of five years and ten months.
    The Li Xingrui hook-up team worked in complex and changeable underground environments. Over the past five years, this team has moved sixteen locations, and they have adopted safety measures according to the situation of the new workplace. Usually, under the leadership of the Party branch, they pay attention to safety education, care for the workers' lives, ensure that the workers are full of energy and concentrated when producing, and strictly implement the job responsibility system and operating procedures. They also paid special attention to improving the workers' technical level. Over the past five years, the members of this team have been replaced many times. Because they paid attention to safety education for new workers and assigned experienced workers to work with new workers to help new workers improve their skills, they maintained the glorious title of safe production.
    Now, after learning from the advanced experience of He Dejiang, a trolley driver from Xiaqiao, who safely operated for 37,000 kilometers, they have proposed to guarantee 500,000 hook-ups of safe operation by 1962. (Our reporter stationed in Nanjing)

    李兴瑞挂钩小组长期安全生产
    贾汪煤矿李兴瑞挂钩小组从1950年5月到1956年3月的五年十个月的时间内，消灭了重大事故和各种责任事故，长期坚持安全生产。
    李兴瑞挂钩小组在井下复杂多变的环境中进行工作。五年多来，这个小组移动了十六个地点，他们都根据新工作地点的情况，采取了安全措施。平时，他们在党支部的领导下，注意安全教育，关心工人生活，保证工人生产的时候精力饱满，思想集中，并且严格执行工作责任制度和操作规程。他们还特别注意提高了工人的技术水平。五年多来，这个小组的人员经过多次调换，由于他们注意对新工人进行安全教育，并且调配骨干和新工人一起工作，帮助新工人提高技术，结果保持了安全生产的光荣称号。
    现在他们学习了夏桥电车司机何德江安全运转三万七千公里的先进经验以后，提出要在1962年以前保证安全运转五十万钩。（本报驻南京记者）
