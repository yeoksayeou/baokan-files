Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 15th: Workers in Shenyang are launching a competition to strive for excellent products.

Since the advanced producer movement was launched in depth in Shenyang, in the workshops of more than twenty state-owned factories, they have announced key problems that urgently need to be solved to improve product quality. Workers call these problems "topics." Many workers have written their names below the topics, expressing their determination to solve them.

Now, workers, engineers, technicians, and administrative staff throughout the city are solving the topics that have been raised. Workers in the casting workshop of the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory conscientiously implement the process regulations, and the quality of their castings is the best in the city. After this workshop was rated as a model unit in Shenyang, casting workers from many factories visited and learned from their work attitude and operational experience. A new atmosphere has emerged in many factory casting workshops. Workers in the second workshop of the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant carefully review drawings and operate diligently during processing. Since the beginning of this year, more than 80% of the workers have not produced a single defective product.

In Shenyang's design units, an experience exchange conference on improving design quality was held in early May. Engineers and technicians from the Shenyang Transformer Factory launched a "zero-error design" competition. In the competition, they put forward sixty-six suggestions for improving design quality, ensuring that none of the 15,000 drawings produced had any errors. 101 inspectors at the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory proposed launching an "Excellent Inspector" competition, which has also been enthusiastically responded to by inspectors from more than ten factories, including the Shenyang Chemical Plant.

Several hundred high-quality workers have emerged in various factories. Now, they are concentrating their efforts to lead the vast number of workers to adopt the method of analyzing and improving simultaneously, striving to further improve product quality.

    沈阳职工开展争取做出优秀产品竞赛
    据新华社沈阳15日电　沈阳市职工正在开展争取做出优秀产品的竞赛。
    先进生产者运动在沈阳市深入开展以来，有二十多个国营工厂的车间里，都公布着急需解决的提高产品质量的关键问题，工人们把这些问题叫作课题；许多工人在课题下边写上了自己的名字，表示决心解决它。
    现在，全市工人、工程技术人员和科室管理人员，正在解决已经提出来的课题。沈阳第二机床厂铸造车间的工人，认真执行了工艺规程，铸件的质量在全市最好。这个车间被评为沈阳市模范单位以后，许多工厂的铸造工人参观和学习了他们的劳动态度和操作经验。很多工厂的铸造车间都出现了新气象。沈阳矿山机器厂第二车间工人在加工过程中都细心看图、认真操作，今年以来有80％以上的工人没出一件废品。
    在沈阳的设计单位，五月上旬召开了提高设计质量的经验交流大会。沈阳变压器厂的工程技术人员开展了“无差错设计”竞赛。他们在竞赛中，提出六十六件提高设计质量的建议，使制出的一万五千张图纸没有发生任何错误。沈阳风动工具厂101名检查员，提议开展“优秀检查员”竞赛，也已经受到沈阳化工厂等十多个工厂的检查员们的热烈响应。
    各工厂已经涌现了几百名优等质量工作者。现在，他们正集中力量，带动广大职工采取边分析边改进的办法，为进一步提高产品质量而努力。
