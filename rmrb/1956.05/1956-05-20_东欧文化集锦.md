Eastern European Cultural Collection

	The "House of Journalists" in Bucharest
	The "House of Journalists" of the Romanian Journalists Association is located in a building in the center of Bucharest. Various cultural activities and artistic evenings are often organized here for the capital's journalists and their families.
	Every Sunday or holiday, people can see performances by the most famous artists and musicians here: sometimes performances by the National Symphony Orchestra, sometimes excerpts from ballet dancers or folk dances, and sometimes poetry recitations.
	Government ministers, leaders of enterprises or institutions often come here to talk to journalists about various issues in national life or to introduce the work of their units. Various people returning from visits abroad also often come here to talk to journalists about their impressions.
	The "House of Journalists" hosts many beneficial learning activities. Those who wish to improve or enhance their foreign language skills can attend Russian, English or French classes here, and those who like photography can get guidance and help from famous photographers. Issues related to journalistic work are also often discussed here.
	Another activity of the "House of Journalists" is to organize chess, table tennis, tennis, and other competitions for journalists, as well as organize trips and vacations to the mountains and seaside.
	The "House of Journalists" often receives colleagues from the Soviet Union, the United States, Germany, Mexico, Syria, Vietnam, and other countries. Some foreign artists who come to Romania to visit and perform also often perform here.

	The Good Soldier Švejk Returns to the Silver Screen
	The famous novel "The Good Soldier Švejk" by the Czech writer Jaroslav Hašek will be filmed again. It will be directed by Karel Steklý, with the famous actor Rudolf Hrušínský in the leading role. The first part of this film will be completed in early next year.
	"The Good Soldier Švejk" was first made into a silent film in 1926. Later, in 1931, it was made into a sound film. Not long ago, Czechoslovakia adapted this novel into a puppet show film. The new film planned for production will be a great improvement over the past in terms of both content and artistic level.

	Poland Publishes Ten Billion Newspapers and Periodicals in Six Years
	Newspapers and periodicals have become a major spiritual food for the Polish people. The annual circulation of newspapers in Poland has now reached 1.8 billion copies. Warsaw has an average of 150 newspapers per person per year, Stalinogród 85, and Gdańsk 82. Calculated on the basis of the national population, there are 64 newspapers and periodicals per person.
	From 1949 to 1955, a total of ten billion copies of newspapers and periodicals were issued throughout Poland.

	Cultivating Future Musicians
	Hungary has recently opened some new music schools in six cities across the country. Now, in addition to Budapest, Hungary has 36 music schools with more than 25,000 students. Considering that Hungary's total population is less than 10 million, this number is indeed astonishing.
	The main task of these music schools is to cultivate future musicians, while also enriching the musical life of the cities where they are located. They will regularly hold various concerts, mainly performed by students.

    东欧文化集锦
    布加勒斯特的“记者之家”
    在布加勒斯特市中心区的一座大厦内，设有罗马尼亚记者协会的“记者之家”。在这里经常为首都的新闻工作者和他们的家属组织各种各样的文化活动和艺术晚会。
    每逢星期日或休假日，人们可以在这里看到最著名的艺术家和音乐家们的表演：有时是国家交响乐队的演奏，有时是巴蕾舞家演出的一些片断或民间歌舞，有时是诗歌的朗诵。
    政府的部长们，企业或机关的领导者们，常常到这里来和记者们交谈国家生活中的各种问题，或者向他们介绍自己所属单位的工作情况。访问国外归来的各种人士也常常到这里来向记者们谈谈自己的观感。
    “记者之家”举办着许多有益的学习活动。那些希望进修或提高外国文程度的人们可以在这里参加俄语、英语或法语班，喜欢摄影的人可以得到著名的摄影家们的指导帮助。这里也常常讨论一些有关新闻业务的问题。
    “记者之家”的另一项活动，是为新闻工作者组织象棋、乒乓、网球等比赛，和组织到山间海滨去旅行、休假。
    在“记者之家”常常接待从苏联、美国、德国、墨西哥、叙利亚、越南和其他国家来的同行们。一些到罗马尼亚来访问演出的外国艺术家们也常来这里表演。
    好兵帅克再上银幕
    捷克斯洛伐克作家雅罗斯拉夫·哈谢克的名著“好兵帅克”，将再一次被摄成电影。由卡里尔·斯迪克莱导演，并由名演员鲁道尔夫·赫鲁辛斯基担任主角。这部影片的第一部分将在明年年初完成。
    “好兵帅克”曾在1926年第一次摄成无声电影。后来在1931年时又摄成有声电影。不久以前，捷克斯洛伐克曾把这部小说改编摄成木偶剧影片。现在计划开拍的新片无论在内容或艺术水平方面，都将比过去有很大的进步。
    波兰六年来出版报刊一百亿份
    报刊已经成为波兰人民生活中的主要精神食粮了。现在波兰每年的报纸发行量已达到十八亿份。华沙每年平均每人有一百五十份报纸，斯大林诺格罗德为八十五份，革但斯克为八十二份。如按全国人口平均计算，每人有报刊六十四份。
    从1949年到1955年，波兰全国发行的报刊总共达到一百亿份。
    培养未来的音乐家
    匈牙利最近在全国六个城市中又开办了一些新的音乐学校。现在除布达佩斯以外，匈牙利已有音乐学校三十六所，学生达二万五千人以上。如果考虑到匈牙利全国人口还不到一千万的话，这个数字的确是值得惊人的了。
    这些音乐学校的主要任务是培养未来的音乐家，同时还要丰富所在城市的音乐生活。它们将经常举办一些主要由学生参加演奏的各种音乐会。
