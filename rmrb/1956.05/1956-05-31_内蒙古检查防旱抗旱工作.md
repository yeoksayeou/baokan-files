Inner Mongolia Inspects Drought Prevention and Combating Work

This April and May, there has been very little rain in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In order to prevent farmers from reducing production due to drought, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has issued instructions calling on Party committees at all levels to actively lead drought prevention and combating work. The Autonomous Region Party Committee has also organized a spring inspection team of more than 50 people for drought prevention and combating to go to various leagues and banners (counties) to assist in the work.

    内蒙古检查防旱抗旱工作
    今年四、五月，内蒙古自治区很少下雨。为了不使农民因旱减产，中共内蒙古自治区委员会已经发出指示，号召各级党委积极领导防旱抗旱工作。自治区党委还组织了五十多人的防旱抗旱春耕检查组，分头到各盟、旗（县）协助工作。（本报驻呼和浩特记者）
