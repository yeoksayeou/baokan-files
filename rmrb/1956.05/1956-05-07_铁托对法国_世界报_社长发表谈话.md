　　Xinhua News Agency, May 6th: According to a Yugoslav news agency dispatch from Paris on the 5th, President Tito, in an interview with Hubert Beuve-Méry, president of the Parisian newspaper "Le Monde," said: The changes in the Soviet Union are undoubtedly of great significance for the future development of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, as well as for the easing of the world situation. President Tito believes that the changes in the Soviet Union should not be seen as a "new tactic."

　　President Tito made these remarks on the eve of his upcoming visit to France at the invitation of the French government. He is scheduled to visit France on May 7th.

　　President Tito, when speaking about Yugoslavia, said: The Yugoslav system is not a one-party system, because the Socialist Alliance of Working People unites various organizations. Under a system like Yugoslavia, free discussion is possible, because this system is the most democratic. Changes are possible in this system, but they will only change for the better. It cannot be said that this system is already perfect. Human society may never reach perfection, because new conditions are constantly developing, forcing people to find new methods.

　　President Tito said that under the current circumstances, the Yugoslav system does not require any major changes. This does not mean that the Yugoslav system is static. Yugoslavia is now experiencing the process of developing its life, and human society, especially socialist society, formulates its internal relations according to its level of awareness at a certain period and according to economic possibilities. Tito said that if the majority of the people are not firmly convinced that a certain measure is necessary and correct, it cannot be implemented in Yugoslavia.

　　President Tito continued, the differences between Marxism and the Western views on humanitarianism are not only great today, but will remain great in the future. In the West, humanitarianism is mainly lip service; it does not conform to the economic system, nor to the possibility of individuals realizing their rights. Although neither Yugoslavia nor other socialist countries have so far achieved their material conditions, there is this prospect: the individual will be given his rights and will be paid according to his needs rather than according to his achievements. In the West, there is no such prospect.

　　Tito, emphasizing that the current civilization will ultimately move towards socialism, said that the socialist system will be realized in the West sooner or later, and it will be much easier to realize than in backward countries.

　　Tito finally said that the establishment of a Balkan alliance is completely inappropriate and would only complicate the current situation in the Balkans and Europe.

　　铁托对法国“世界报”社长发表谈话
    新华社6日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社巴黎五日讯，铁托总统在对巴黎“世界报”社长雨伯尔·勃夫—梅利发表的一篇谈话中说：苏联的改变对于苏联和其他社会主义国家今后的发展和对世界局势的缓和，毫无疑问都是具有重大意义的。铁托总统认为，不能把苏联的改变看作是“新策略”。
    铁托总统是在即将应邀赴法访问前夕发表这篇谈话的。他预订于五月七日访问法国。
    铁托总统在谈到南斯拉夫时说：南斯拉夫的制度不是一党制，因为劳动人民社会主义联盟团结着各种组织。在像南斯拉夫这样的制度下是有可能进行自由讨论的，因为这种制度是最民主的制度。在这种制度中是可能会发生改变的，但是它只会向好的方向改变。现在还不能说这种制度已经是十全十美的了。人类社会也许永远也不会达到十全十美的地步，因为新的条件一直在继续不断地发展着，它们迫使人们要找出新的方法。
    铁托总统说，在目前情况下，南斯拉夫的制度不需要作任何重大的改变。这并不是说南斯拉夫的制度是静止不变的。南斯拉夫现在正在经历发展它的生活过程，人类社会，特别是社会主义社会，根据它在一定时期的觉悟程度和根据经济可能性来制定它的内部关系。铁托说，如果大多数人民并不肯定地相信某种措施是必要的和正确的，这种措施就不可能在南斯拉夫实施。
    铁托总统继续说，马克思主义和西方对人道主义的看法存在的分歧，不但在今天是很大的，而且在将来仍旧会是很大的。在西方，人道主义主要是口头说说的，它并不符合经济制度，也不符合个人实现他的权利的可能性。虽然无论在南斯拉夫和其他社会主义国家迄今都还没有取得它们的物质条件，但是有这样的前景：个人将得到他的权利，并且将根据他的需要而不是根据他的成绩取得报酬。在西方，就没有这样的前景。
    铁托在强调指出目前的文明制度最终要走向社会主义的时候说，社会主义制度迟早将会在西方实现，而且比在落后国家实现要容易得多。
    铁托最后说，成立一个巴尔干联盟是完全不合时宜的，这只会使目前巴尔干和欧洲的局势复杂化。
