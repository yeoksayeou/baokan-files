Answering Readers' Questions

Many readers have written letters raising some questions about labor employment work. Now, we provide comprehensive answers as follows:

Over the past six years, thanks to the various effective measures taken by the People's Government, the serious unemployment situation left over from old China has been greatly alleviated. By the end of 1955, labor departments nationwide had introduced employment and resettlement arrangements for a total of more than 2.58 million unemployed people. The People's Government also provides necessary relief to unemployed people who have temporary difficulties in finding employment.

Since the second half of 1955, new situations have emerged in urban labor employment work due to the advent of a high tide of socialist construction. First, the agricultural cooperation movement has developed, and farmers' incomes have increased. Not only do farmers no longer blindly flock to the cities, but many regions have also organized many unemployed urban residents to participate in agricultural production. Secondly, industrial development has accelerated, and the industrial, construction, and transportation sectors have also increased their demand for workers. Therefore, all urban unemployed people with industrial production skills or physical labor abilities will have employment opportunities in the future.

In order to accomplish the historically significant task of eliminating unemployment, various localities are currently conducting a census of unemployed urban residents in accordance with Article 39 of the National Agricultural Development Program, making comprehensive plans based on production needs and their employment conditions, and formulating specific resettlement plans.

  The elderly, weak, sick, and disabled should be treated as social relief cases

Among the current unemployed, there are some elderly, weak, sick, and disabled individuals, some of whom have completely lost their ability to work. What these elderly, weak, and disabled individuals urgently need to solve is not the issue of employment, but how to take care of their lives. Those who have financial difficulties, especially those who are destitute, should be given necessary social relief to ensure their lives. Therefore, the elderly, weak, and disabled among the unemployed have been handled by the civil affairs departments as social relief cases, and the lives of the elderly, weak, and disabled in various places who have financial difficulties may be guaranteed.

  Housewives should focus on housework

Many are housewives who engage in housework. Seeing the vigorous development of the motherland's industrial and agricultural construction, they also propose to participate in work. This enthusiasm is very good. However, we know that building the motherland requires many people to engage in production labor, but it also requires people to engage in housework. This is the division of labor in society. Housework is also an indispensable task in society and is just as important as social labor. Housewives who arrange their family life well and ensure that their families can concentrate on production and work are also contributing to the motherland's socialist construction. In addition, the important and glorious task of raising children also needs to be undertaken by housewives. Therefore, we should criticize the erroneous concept of belittling housework left over from the old society and allow housewives to focus on housework.

       Abide by the unified arrangements of the state

The state's arrangements for unemployed urban residents must, on the one hand, enable the country's construction to obtain the labor force that meets its needs, so as to facilitate the development of production; on the other hand, enable unemployed urban residents to obtain jobs that they can handle and exert greater strength in production. For example, those with skills are introduced to work according to production needs, and general ordinary laborers are transferred to basic construction units as coolies; those with agricultural production conditions are organized to participate in immigration and reclamation, and so on.

Due to the abnormal development of industry and the unbalanced distribution of population in old China, there is a shortage of labor in the key construction areas of the country today, and a surplus of a large number of laborers in coastal cities. In order to change this situation that hinders the development of construction, the state must balance the labor force between regions. As a result, some unemployed urban residents will have to be transferred to other places to participate in construction. If this is not done, not only will production be lost, but the unemployed will not be able to find employment locally. Therefore, balancing the labor force between regions is in line with the interests of the state and the interests of the unemployed. In addition, the government has also taken care of the relocation and resettlement of their families and the employment of their spouses as much as possible when transferring workers from long distances. At present, there are still a few unemployed people who do not understand this principle and are picky about jobs and regions when they are employed, which is wrong. It is hoped that they will recognize the prospect of employment, abide by the unified allocation of the state, so that they can get employment opportunities as soon as possible and contribute their strength to national construction.

### 有关劳动就业的一些问题

    有关劳动就业的一些问题
    不少读者来信，对劳动就业工作提出了一些问题。现在，我们综合答复如下：
    六年来，由于人民政府采取了各种有效措施，旧中国遗留下来的严重失业现象，已经大大减轻了。截至1955年底止，全国经劳动部门介绍就业和安置处理的失业人员共有258万多人。人民政府对于一时难以就业而生活困难的失业人员还给予必要的救济。
    自1955年下半年以来，由于社会主义建设高潮的到来，城市劳动就业工作出现了新的情况。首先，农业合作化运动发展了，农民的收入增多，不仅农民不再盲目进城，而且有不少地区还组织了很多城市失业人员参加农业生产。其次，工业发展加快了，各工业、建筑、交通部门需要的职工也增加了，因此凡是具备工业生产技能或具有体力劳动的城市失业人员，今后都有了就业的机会。
    为了完成消灭失业这一具有历史意义的任务，目前各地正根据全国农业发展纲要第三十九条的规定，对城市失业人员进行清查工作，根据生产需要和他们的就业条件进行全面规划，制定具体的安置方案。
  老弱病残应当作为社会救济问题处理
    在现有失业人员中，有一部分老、弱、病、残人员，其中有的已经完全丧失了劳动能力。这部分老弱残疾人员迫切需要解决的不是就业问题，而是如何照顾他们的生活问题。对其中生活困难的，特别是一些无依无靠的人，应当给以必要的社会救济，以保障他们的生活。所以失业人员中的老弱残疾人员已由民政部门作为社会救济问题处理，各地生活困难的老弱残疾人员的生活都可能有了保障。
    家庭主妇应该安心家务劳动
    有不少是从事家务劳动的家庭主妇，由于看见祖国工农业建设的蓬勃发展，也提出要参加工作。这种热情是很好的。但是我们知道，建设祖国需要很多人从事生产劳动，同时也需要有人从事家务劳动，这是社会的分工。家务劳动也是社会中不可缺少的一项劳动，和社会劳动是同样重要的。家庭主妇很好地安排家庭生活，保证她们的家属能够安心进行生产和工作，这也就是对祖国社会主义建设事业的贡献。另外，抚养儿童这项重要而光荣的工作，也需要家庭主妇担当起来。因此，我们应该批判旧社会遗留下来的轻视家务劳动的错误观念，让家庭主妇们安心地从事家务劳动。
       服从国家的统一安排
    国家对城市失业人员的安排，一方面要使国家建设获得符合需要的劳动力，以利于生产的发展：另一方面要使城市失业人员得到自己能够胜任的工作，在生产中发挥更大的力量。例如：有技术的根据生产需要介绍工作，一般普通劳动力调配到基本建设单位作壮工；有从事农业生产条件的，组织参加移民开垦，等等。
    由于旧中国工业的畸形发展和人口分布不平衡，造成了今天国家重点建设地区缺少劳动力、而沿海城市多余大批劳动力的状况。为了改变这种阻碍建设发展的情况，国家必须在地区之间对劳动力进行平衡工作。这样一来，有些城市失业人员便要调到外地去参加建设。如果不这样做，不但会使生产受到损失，而且失业人员在当地也不能就业。所以在地区之间进行劳动力的平衡工作，既符合国家利益，也符合失业人员的利益。此外，政府在从远距离调动工人的时候，还尽可能地照顾了他们家眷的迁移安置问题和爱人的工作问题。目前，还有少数失业人员不懂得这个道理，在就业的时候挑工作，挑地区，这是不对的。希望他们认清就业前途，服从国家的统一调配，使自己及早得到就业机会，并且在国家建设中献出力量。
