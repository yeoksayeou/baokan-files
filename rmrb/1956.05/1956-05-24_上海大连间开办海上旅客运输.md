    Shanghai-Dalian Sea Passenger Transport Service to Open
    The Ministry of Communications has decided to open a Shanghai-Dalian sea passenger transport service starting June 1st of this year. The ships operating on this route will be the well-equipped "Democracy No. 9" and "Zhongxing No. 9," which have soft and hard sleeper berths. The two ships will depart from Shanghai and Dalian on the 1st, 6th, 11th, 16th, 21st, and 26th of each month, respectively, stopping at Qingdao for passengers to embark and disembark.

    Passengers taking ships on this route will not only be able to enjoy the scenery of the motherland's ocean but also shorten their journey and reduce their expenses. Compared to taking the train from Shanghai to Dalian, the journey is shortened by more than 1,200 kilometers, and the travel expenses, calculated based on a hard sleeper berth, can be reduced by more than 62 yuan.

    上海大连间开办海上旅客运输
    交通部决定自今年六月一日起，开办上海—大连间海上旅客运输。将在这条航线上航行的轮船，是设备完善的“民主九号”和“中兴九号”，上面有软、硬卧铺。两轮每逢一、六、十一、十六、二十一、二十六日，分别自上海、大连两港对开，中途在青岛上下客。
    旅客们搭乘这条航线上的轮船，不仅能饱览祖国海洋的风光，还能缩短旅程，少花费用。如果同上海到大连坐火车相比较，旅程缩短一千二百多公里，旅费如按乘硬席卧铺计算，能节省六十二元多。　（新华社）
