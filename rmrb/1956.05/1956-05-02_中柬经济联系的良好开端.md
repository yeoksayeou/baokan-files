A Good Start to China-Cambodia Economic Ties

China and Cambodia signed the China-Cambodia Trade Agreement and Payment Agreement on April 24. The signing of these two agreements marks a good start to the development of economic cooperation and ties between China and Cambodia on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

In February this year, former Cambodian Prime Minister Prince Norodom Sihanouk visited China. Since then, the friendly relations between China and Cambodia have undergone new developments. The joint statement of Prince Sihanouk and Premier Zhou Enlai expressed that the two countries should continue to maintain and enhance contact and ties, especially in the economic and cultural fields. The signing of the China-Cambodia Trade Agreement and Payment Agreement is one of the concrete steps to realize this common desire of both parties.

The development of economic relations between China and Cambodia has a solid foundation. This is not only because the two countries have materials and products that can be exchanged to meet each other's needs. More importantly, both countries share a common stand against colonialism, safeguarding national independence, and developing their own economies. Therefore, economic ties and cooperation between the two countries based on the Five Principles will inevitably aim to strengthen the economic independence and prosperity of both countries, and will be of a sincere and selfless nature. The fact that the China-Cambodia economic and trade negotiations were able to reach an agreement quickly in an atmosphere of full understanding is due to this reason.

The representatives of China and Cambodia also discussed the issue of economic assistance during the negotiations. The representatives of both parties prepared to submit this issue to their respective governments for consideration. This foreshadows the possibility of further development of economic relations between China and Cambodia. The Chinese people know from their own painful experience that colonial countries, in order to maintain their control over Asian countries, have never been willing to help Asian countries develop their own industries; they always try to tie the economies of Asian countries to the wheels of their monopoly economies, so that the Asian people serve the profits of monopoly capital. Even the so-called "economic assistance" they have given to Asian countries in recent years has had no other purpose or effect. The Cambodian people have also had the same experience with these practices of the colonial countries, and have waged a strong struggle. In particular, recently, in order to safeguard the solemn right of the Cambodian people to be masters of their own country, under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk, they strongly counterattacked the attempts of some countries to continue to control Cambodia. This counterattack has been effective. It has aroused people's respect. It is necessary for Asian countries to obtain economic assistance from other countries in order to achieve their own industrialization, but this economic assistance must not be detrimental to national sovereignty and independence, nor must it hinder the development of the recipient country's independent economy. On this point, the Chinese people and the people of Asian countries share the same sentiment and understanding.

We believe that with the development of economic ties between China and Cambodia, the economies of both countries will be further prosperous, and the trust and friendly cooperation between the two countries will be further strengthened. This will be a great contribution to peace in Asia and the world.

### 中柬经济联系的良好开端

　　中柬经济联系的良好开端
    中柬两国在四月二十四日签订了中柬两国贸易协定和支付协定。这两个协定的签订，给中柬两国在平等互利的基础上发展经济合作和联系作了良好的开端。
    今年二月间，柬埔寨王国前首相西哈努克亲王访问了中国。从这以后，中柬两国之间的友好关系已经有了新的发展。西哈努克亲王和周恩来总理的联合声明曾经表示应该继续保持和增进两国间的接触和联系，尤其是经济和文化方面的联系。中柬贸易协定和支付协定的签订，就是实现双方这个共同愿望的具体步骤之一。
    中柬两国之间的经济关系的发展是有着坚实的基础的。这不仅是因为两国之间有着可以互相交换的物资和产品，可以互通有无。更重要的是两国都有着反对殖民主义、维护民族独立、发展本国经济的共同主张。因此，两国之间在五项原则基础上进行的经济联系和合作，必然要以加强两国的经济上的独立和繁荣为目的，并且具有真诚无私的性质。中柬两国经济贸易谈判能够在充分谅解的气氛中迅速达成协议，就是这个原故。
    中柬两国代表在谈判中还曾经谈到经济援助问题。双方代表准备将这个问题提交各自政府加以考虑。这预示了中柬两国经济关系进一步发展的可能。中国人民从自己的痛苦经验中知道，殖民国家为了保持它们对亚洲各国的控制地位，从来不愿意帮助亚洲国家发展他们自己本国的工业；它们总是想方设法，把亚洲国家的经济绑在它们的垄断经济的车轮上，使亚洲人民为垄断资本的利润服务。就是最近几年来它们对亚洲国家的所谓“经济援助”，其目的和作用也不外乎此。柬埔寨人民对殖民国家的这些做法也有同样的体会，也作了坚强的斗争。特别是最近，为了维护柬埔寨人民做自己国家的主人的庄严权利，他们在西哈努克亲王的领导之下，强烈地反击了有的国家想继续控制柬埔寨的做法。这种反击是有成效的。它引起了人们的尊敬。亚洲国家为了实现本国的工业化，从其他任何国家取得经济援助是必要的，但是这种经济援助决不能有损于国家的主权和独立，决不能阻碍受援国的独立经济的发展。关于这一点，中国人民和亚洲各国人民是人同此心，心同此理。
    我们相信，随着中柬两国经济联系的发展，两国的经济将得到进一步的繁荣，两国之间的信任和友好合作也将更为加强。这对于亚洲和世界和平将是很好的贡献。
