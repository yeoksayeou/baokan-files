Elementary School Students' Small Factories and Small Farms

Xinhua News Agency reported: On May 27th, the students of Nanchang Experimental Elementary School held a launching ceremony for the "June 1st" model ship. This "June 1st" small ship was successfully made by the little workers of the school's small factory after twelve failures.

In recent years, more than two hundred elementary school students in Nanchang Experimental Elementary School have participated in activities in the school's factory, farm, weather station, radio station, and sanitation team in their spare time. The little workers of the small farm planted sunflowers, corn, eggplant and other crops in the garden. Members of the Michurin group also conducted experiments on the fertilizer effect of ammonium sulfate on tomatoes and various grafting experiments. Students participating in weather station activities have become accustomed to publishing the day's weather forecast on the small blackboard every morning before students arrive at school. In the small factory, more than seventy little workers are engaged in production in the metalworking, woodworking, electrical, sewing, airplane model, and plaster model workshops.

"Young Pioneers Red Factory"

Xinhua News Agency reported: The children of the "Young Pioneers Red Factory" of Hebei Elementary School in Baoding City are rushing to make a batch of "June 1st" Children's Day gifts—cloth dolls and roly-poly toys—for their younger brothers and sisters in kindergarten. Some children are rushing to make elementary traction and catapult-type airplane models, preparing to participate in the "June 1st" Children's Day school airplane model performance competition.

This "Young Pioneers Red Factory" was established in March this year. Currently, more than one hundred children are participating, all of whom are Young Pioneers members above the third grade. The factory director, workshop directors, and technical instructors are all children, and two teachers have been hired as engineers. This factory includes three workshops: aviation models, weaving, and iron and woodworking. More than a month since starting work, it has produced more than fifty various airplane models and a batch of cross-stitch handkerchiefs. Through practical operations, the children have initially understood the names of various parts of the airplane and the principles of airplane takeoff.

Radio Evening for Young People

Xinhua News Agency reported: An interesting radio evening was held at the Shanghai Children's Palace on the 26th.

More than six hundred young radio enthusiasts listened attentively to a popular lecture on "The Present and Future of Radio Science" given by Chen Hongbin, a lecturer at Jiaotong University, in the Youth Hall.

Fifteen radio receivers and a transmitter were displayed upstairs in the Children's Palace. This is part of the work of the Children's Palace radio group. The displayed transmitter aroused great interest among the visitors. People could use a shortwave radio to receive the control signals it emitted within a short distance. The members of the radio group who made this transmitter are also preparing to make a radio-controlled ship model. Many people gathered around a five-tube radio assembled by Ye Linlin, a second-year junior high school student at Yucai Middle School, to listen to songs. The sound of this radio was even and without any background noise.

The children also guessed radio science riddles in a house called "Why".

Six-Year-Old "Pianist"

Xinhua News Agency reported: Six-year-old "little pianist" Wang Daoxin won first prize at the Fuzhou Municipal Children's Art Performance Conference on the 27th for playing three pieces: "Singing for the Motherland", Tchaikovsky's "Lyrical Piece", and He Luting's "The Shepherd Boy's Flute".

Wang Daoxin is a child in the senior class of the kindergarten attached to the Second Central Elementary School in Cangshan. His mother is a vocal music teacher in the Music Department of Fujian Normal College, and his father, Wang Yue, is a professor at Fujian Normal College and also loves music. They have a piano at home. Wang Daoxin often listened to his mother playing the piano and sometimes touched it himself. Last September, Chen Pei, a piano teacher at Fujian Normal College and a colleague of his mother, officially taught Wang Daoxin to read musical scores and play the piano, teaching him once a week. Wang Daoxin has a very strong ability to read scores. He can learn two or three songs a week. So far, he has learned more than thirty pieces of small musical compositions by Beethoven, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky, as well as Mongolian dance music.

    今天的小专家，祖国未来的建设者
    小学生的小工厂小农场
    南昌市实验小学的学生们在二十七日举行“六一”号轮船模型的起航典礼。这艘“六一”号小轮船是这所学校小工厂的小工人们经过十二次失败以后制作成功的。
    最近几年来，南昌市实验小学有二百多个小学生在课余时间参加了校内设置的工厂、农场、气象台、广播站和卫生队的活动。小农场的小工人们在园地里种了向日葵、玉米、茄子等作物。米丘林小组的组员还进行了硫酸铵对蕃茄的肥效试验和各种嫁接试验。参加气象台活动的学生，已经习惯地在每天早上同学们到校以前，就把当天的气象预报公布在小黑板上。小工厂里有七十多个小工人分别在金工、木工、电工、缝纫、飞机模型和石膏模型车间进行生产。　（据新华社讯）
    “少年红色工厂”
    保定市河北小学“少年红色工厂”的孩子们正在为幼儿园的弟弟妹妹们赶作一批“六一”儿童节的礼物——布娃娃和不倒翁。有些孩子正赶制初级牵引和弹射式飞机模型，准备参加“六一”儿童节校内的飞机模型表演比赛。
    这个“少年红色工厂”是今年三月建立的，现在共有一百多个孩子参加，他们全是三年级以上的少年先锋队队员。厂长、车间主任和技术指导都由孩子们担任，两位教师被聘请作工程师。这个工厂包括航空模型、编织、铁木工三个车间。开工一个多月以来，已作出了各种飞机模型五十多架和一批十字挑花手帕。孩子们经过实际操作，初步懂得了飞机各部位的名称以及飞机起飞的原理。

    少年们的无线电晚会
    上海市的少年宫里二十六日举行了一次有趣的无线电晚会。
    六百多个少年无线电爱好者，在少年厅里聚精会神地听了交通大学讲师陈鸿彬作的通俗讲演“无线电科学的现在和将来”。
    少年宫楼上展出了十五架无线电收音机和一架发话机。这是少年宫无线电小组作品的一部分。展出的这架发话机引起了参观者很大的兴趣，人们可以用短波收音机收听到它在短距离内发出的操纵信号。制造这架发话机的无线电小组的组员们，还准备要制造一个用无线电操纵的舰船模型。许多人围在育材中学初中二年级学生叶琳琳装配的五灯机旁收听歌曲。这架收音机声音均匀，没有一点隔音。
    孩子们还在一幢名叫“为什么”的房子里猜无线电科学谜语。
