The entire reconstruction project of the Shenyang Wire Factory is nearing completion. Currently, construction workers are working intensely on the final finishing touches of the factory's office building, dispatch room, and ground leveling.

After three years of intense construction, the Shenyang Wire Factory has now taken on a brand-new look: brown-red factory buildings stand tall on both sides of the concrete road. The chimneys pointing towards the sky are already slowly emitting white smoke. The scaffolding surrounding the tall buildings has been removed. The sound of mechanical roaring, metal welding, and metal clashing that were usually heard on the construction site have now been replaced by the "clunking" sound of the rolling mill. Within the factory area, the final section of the road is being compacted. All of this tells people that the reconstructed Shenyang Wire Factory is on the eve of its official handover to production.

In the spacious and bright factory buildings, many machines have already started up, and workers are trial-producing and manufacturing steel-cored aluminum stranded wire, bare wire, flexible rope wire, yarn-covered wire, and other products for the country. The Foziling Hydropower Station and Meishan Hydropower Station in the Huai River basin have already been powered by the high-voltage lines produced by the Shenyang Wire Factory. This year, the factory will also trial-produce seventeen new products (wires and cables) to support socialist construction.

Wires and cables are very familiar to people. Walking on the road, sitting on trains, trams, or automobiles, standing beside the machines in factories, you will see wires and cables. Without cables and wires, all kinds of machines in heavy or light industrial factories would be stuck there, unable to move; manufacturing or operating machines, airplanes, automobiles, trains, ships, tractors, generators, transformers, etc., would also become impossible. Without cables and wires, the use of electric picks, rock drills, pneumatic shovels, and other mechanized equipment would not be possible for mining the country's underground treasures; the use of all communication equipment, watching movies, riding trams, and listening to the radio would all become impossible. Cables and wires are indispensable materials for production, construction, and people's lives. The Shenyang Wire Factory is precisely a factory that produces these materials in large quantities.

The Shenyang Wire Factory officially started reconstruction in the spring of 1954. All the major processes of the factory, from copper smelting and rolling to stranding..., are automated and mechanized, so various specifications of cables and wires can be produced in a very short time. More than eighty pieces of equipment in the factory are supplied by fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic. In order to fundamentally ensure quality, the factory also has its own laboratories, testing laboratories, and each workshop also has its own small laboratories and other scientific research institutions. Safety is one of the important characteristics of the Shenyang Wire Factory after reconstruction. All equipment in the factory has safety devices. Before starting, signal lights, signal bells, and signal whistles will warn workers to pay attention.

Each workshop in the factory has shower rooms, changing rooms, and welfare facilities such as dust extraction and the delivery of cold and hot air. With the increase in the proportion of mechanization, physical labor is reduced to a minimum. The copper smelting and rolling workshops, which have always been heavy manual labor, now have a fully mechanized production process from raw material melting, casting, demolding, heating, rolling to transportation. A copper ingot as thick as a bowl automatically passes through the rollers, and in a short time it becomes a copper wire as thin as a finger. The factory also has over 10,000 square meters of green space.

Advanced automated equipment, technical data, rational production organization, and superior working conditions enable the Shenyang Wire Factory to leap to the world's advanced cable industry level, becoming a highly efficient factory capable of producing various cables and wires. After this factory reaches its design standards, its production capacity will be more than six times higher than in 1952 (the year with the highest output for the Shenyang Wire Factory), accounting for about two-thirds of the country's wire production.

    沈阳电线厂的机器开动了
    洪永胜
    沈阳电线厂全部改建工程就要完工了。现在，建筑工人们正在紧张进行厂部办公室、收发室和整修地坪等最后一批收尾工程。
    经过三年来紧张施工的沈阳电线厂，现在已经出现了崭新的面貌：棕红色的厂房耸立在混凝土马路的两旁。高指苍空的烟囱已经徐徐冒出白烟。围在高大的建筑物旁的脚手架已经被拆掉。工地上通常可以听到的机械轰鸣声、金属焊接以及金属碰击的声音，今天已经被“吭吭”的压延机轰响所代替。厂区内，正在碾压最后一段道路。这一切告诉人们：改建的沈阳电线厂已处于正式移交生产的前夕了。
    在宽敞明亮的厂房中，许多机器已经开动起来，工人们正在给国家试制和生产钢芯铝绞线、裸线、软绳线、纱包线等。淮河流域的佛子岭水电站和梅山水电站，已经用沈阳电线厂生产的高压线送电了。今年工厂还将试制十七种新产品（电线和电缆）来支援社会主义建设。
    电线和电缆，是人们最熟悉的。走在马路上，坐在火车、电车、汽车上，站在工厂的机器边，都会看到电线和电缆。如果没有电缆和电线，无论是重工业工厂或者轻工业工厂的各种机器，都会摆在那里动不了；制造或开动机器、飞机、汽车、火车、轮船、拖拉机、发电机、变压器等，也都成为不可能的事情。没有电缆和电线，开采祖国地下宝藏就不能使用电镐、凿岩机、风铲……等机械化设备；一切通讯设备的使用，看电影、坐电车、听收音机都成为不可能。电缆和电线是生产、建设和人民生活上不可缺少的材料。沈阳电线厂正是大批生产这些材料的工厂。
    沈阳电线厂是从1954年春正式动工改建的。全厂从熔铜、压延绞制……，大的工序都是自动化机械化，所以在很短时间内就能生产出各种规格的电缆和电线。全厂八十多种设备是苏联和德意志民主共和国等兄弟国家供给的。为了从根本上保证质量，工厂还有自己的试验室、化验室，各车间也有自己的小型试验室等科学研究机构。安全是改建以后的沈阳电线厂重要特点之一。全厂所有设备上都有安全装置。开动前信号灯、信号铃、信号笛都会预告工人们注意。
    全厂每个车间都有淋浴室、更衣室和吸尘、送冷热风等福利装置。随着机械化比重的增加，体力劳动被减少到最低限度。从来都是笨重体力劳动的熔铜、压延车间，现在从原料熔化、铸锭、脱模、加热、压延到运输的生产过程，完全机械化了。一块碗粗的铜锭自动的在轧辊中穿来穿去，不一会变成比手指头还细的铜线。全厂还有上万平方公尺的绿化区。
    先进的自动化设备，技术资料，合理的生产组织，优越的劳动条件，使沈阳电线厂跃进到世界先进电缆工业水平，成为一座效率极高可以生产各种电缆和电线的工厂。这个工厂达到设计标准以后，生产能力将比1952年（沈阳电线厂产量最高的一年）提高六倍多，占全国电线生产的三分之二左右。
