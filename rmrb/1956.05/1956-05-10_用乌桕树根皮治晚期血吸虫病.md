Using Sapium sebiferum root bark to treat late-stage schistosomiasis

    The Anhui Provincial Department of Health recently summarized a proven prescription using the root bark of the Chinese tallow tree (Sapium sebiferum), a Chinese medicine, to treat late-stage schistosomiasis. It is already being tested in areas such as Wuhu and Huizhou. This is a hereditary prescription passed down for seven generations by Ye Chenghong, an old traditional Chinese medicine doctor from Zhufeng Township, Ningguo County, Anhui Province.

    From January to April of this year, this prescription underwent clinical trials in Ningguo County and other places, with good therapeutic results. Late-stage schistosomiasis patients, after less than a month of treatment, experienced the disappearance of ascites, reduction in the size of the liver and spleen, and more than 90% of the patients recovered their health.

    The Chinese tallow tree is commonly known as the “Jiu Zi” tree. It is produced in Anhui, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other places. The root bark of this tree is inexpensive and easy to administer. It acts relatively quickly in eliminating ascites and restoring health, and the recurrence rate of ascites after it disappears is low. Its effect is even better than using the Chinese herb Lobelia chinensis to treat late-stage schistosomiasis. (Xinhua News Agency)

    用乌桕树根皮治晚期血吸虫病
    安徽省卫生厅最近总结了用中药乌桕树根皮治疗晚期血吸虫病的验方，并且已经在芜湖、徽州等地区试用。这是安徽省宁国县竹峰乡老中医叶成宏公开的祖传七代的验方。
    从今年一月到四月，这个验方在宁国县等地经过临床实验，治疗效果良好。晚期血吸虫病患者经过不到一个月的治疗，腹水消失，肝、脾肿缩小，90％以上的患者都恢复了健康。
    乌桕树俗名叫桕子树。产在安徽、山东、江苏、浙江等地。这种树的根皮价钱低廉，服法简便。它在消失腹水、恢复健康方面的作用比较快，病人腹水消失后复发率少，比用中药半边莲治疗晚期血吸虫病收效更大。  （新华社）
