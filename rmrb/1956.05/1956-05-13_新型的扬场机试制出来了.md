    New Type of Winnowing Machine Successfully Trial-Produced
    A new type of winnowing machine has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Jiamusi Tractor Repair Factory. This machine is manufactured by imitating the latest Soviet grain unloading machine. It can carry out grain transportation within 20 meters, remove impurities from the grain, or send the grain to a height of about 10 meters for air drying. It is operated by two people and can unload 20 tons of grain per hour, equivalent to the workload of ten workers for eight hours. In places without electricity, it can also be driven by a prime mover. (Zhang Nongyang)

    新型的扬场机试制出来了
    一台新型的扬场机最近在佳木斯拖拉机修配厂试制出来了。这台机器是仿照苏联最新型的倒粮机制造的。它能作二十公尺以内的粮食运输工作，能清除粮食中的夹杂物或把粮食送到约十公尺的高度风干。它由两个人操作，每小时可以倒二十吨粮食，相当于十个工人八小时的工作量。它在没有电力的地方，也可以用原动机来带动。　（张农业）
