    Building the First Children's Railway
    China's first children's railway will be built around Nangang Park in Harbin.
    This children's railway is more than two kilometers long, and the Harbin Children's Railway Construction Committee has decided to strive for its opening on "June 1st" International Children's Day. Tens of thousands of young people and teenagers in Harbin will participate in the construction of the railway subgrade through voluntary labor.
    One of the two small locomotives to be used on this children's railway has already been repaired by workers from the Ministry of Forestry's Forest Industry Machinery Factory in their spare time. Workers at the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory are also using waste materials in their spare time to manufacture three sightseeing carriages and one observation carriage for this children's railway.

    修建第一条儿童铁路
    中国第一条儿童铁路将修建在哈尔滨市南岗公园周围。
    这条儿童铁路有两公里多长，哈尔滨儿童铁路修建委员会决定争取它在“六一”国际儿童节通车。哈尔滨市数万青年和少年将以义务劳动参加这条铁路路基的修筑工程。
    准备在这条儿童铁路上行驶的两台小火车头，已经有一台由林业部森林工业机械厂工人用业余时间检修好了。哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂的工人也正在以业余时间利用废料为这条儿童铁路制造三节游览式的小车厢和一节了望车厢。　（新华社）
