Xinhua News Agency, 21st: The Beijing Third Machine Tool Factory, a working machine manufacturing plant designed by our own country, officially started construction today.

After the factory is completed, it will adopt advanced technological processes to manufacture new types of universal milling machines, gantry milling machines, and other products. The foundry workshop will be equipped with mechanized production equipment, and the assembly workshop will be equipped with conveyor belts to facilitate assembly line operations. More than six-fifths of the factory's equipment will be domestically produced machines.

The designers adopted a rapid design method, making as much use as possible of standard designs and referring to the designs of brother factories, so they completed the first batch of construction drawings for the factory buildings in just over three months, more than half the time normally required for design.

The factory's future production workers began training at the beginning of this year.

    北京兴建第三机床厂
    据新华社21日讯　我国自己设计的工作母机制造厂——北京第三机床厂，今天正式动工兴建。
    这个厂建成以后，将采用先进的工艺过程，制造新式的万能铣床、龙门铣床等多种产品。铸造车间将安设机械化生产的装备，装配车间将装置传送带，以便于进行流水作业。工厂六分之五以上的设备，都是国产机器。
    设计师们采取了快速设计的方法，尽量采用标准设计和参照兄弟工厂的设计，因而只三个多月就完成了厂房的第一批施工图纸，比一般设计的时间少了一半以上。
    工厂未来的生产工人，今年年初就开始训练了。
