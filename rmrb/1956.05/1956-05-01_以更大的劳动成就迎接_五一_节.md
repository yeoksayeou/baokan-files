Welcoming the "May Day" Festival with Greater Labor Achievements
    Li Hengkui, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Metallurgical Industry Workers' Union
    The entire staff of our country's metallurgical industry sector welcomes the "May Day" festival, a holiday of great unity for working people around the world, in the solemn labor struggle of building a socialist foundation.

    The joint meeting of workers and staff of industrial and mining enterprises in the Hungnam area, in order to celebrate the convening of the Third Congress of the Korean Workers' Party, called for the overfulfillment of the Three-Year People's Economic Plan within two years and eight months. Metallurgical industry workers enthusiastically responded to this call, launching a vigorous production increase competition.

    The Chongjin Steel Plant, Huanghai Steel Plant, and Gangseon Steel Plant, which occupy an important position in my country's ferrous metallurgical industry, had already completed their three-year plan in mid-April 1956; the entire metallurgical industry sector is determined to complete the three-year plan in two years and eight months, and to complete more than 110% of the 1956 plan by the end of the year.

    The Gangseon Steel Plant's electric furnace workers, who completed the three-year plan on April 13 this year, displayed a high degree of creativity on the eve of "May Day" to shorten the smelting time. As a result, the smelting time was shortened from nineteen hours to twelve hours, and the production plan was overfulfilled by more than 30% every day. The open hearth furnace workers at the Huanghai Steel Plant also shortened the steelmaking time from fifteen hours to twelve hours and nine minutes, significantly overfulfilling their production plan every day.

    In order to increase labor productivity, reduce costs, and save labor, all employees have widely carried out creative invention and rationalization proposal movements. Currently, 3,400 rationalization proposals have been adopted in production, thereby mechanizing production processes and saving a lot of labor. They are engaged in creative labor to increase labor productivity by 11.2% compared to this year's plan and reduce costs by more than 12% compared to 1955.

    In particular, labor hero Han Jichan of the Kim Chaek Steel Plant, in order to save our country's valuable coke, has worked hard to improve operating methods, saving 6,700 tons of coke in the first quarter of this year alone; he will save 27,000 tons of coke this year and increase smelting efficiency to 110%.

    On the eve of "May Day," employees in the mining sector are also carrying out creative labor struggles to overfulfill the postwar Three-Year People's Economic Plan.

    The work team led by Seongcheon Mine driller Li Chandao, due to the implementation of the duplex drilling operation method and the standardized blasting operation method, and the movement to supervise more machines, the work that used to be done by four people can now be completed by three people, and the mining index has increased from 24 tons to 32 tons, completing the annual production plan 53 days ahead of schedule; they also put forward the struggle goal of mining more than 800 tons, and they are now successfully completing the plan.

    Jeomdeok driller and labor hero Zhao Doushi, who created a new production record during the difficult war environment by adopting the staged mining method, increased the mining volume from 30 tons to 952 tons, and increased production efficiency to 3,170%; thanks to our vigorous promotion of his experience, we have achieved great success in developing underground resources.

    Heochang Mine driller and labor hero Cha Changseon, Seongheung Mine driller Park Jin Hwan, Seongcheon Mine Zhang Shijun and hundreds of other miners have adopted the staged mining method, and they have decided to complete the 1956 production plan when welcoming "May Day".

    Workers and technicians in the geological exploration department have improved geological exploration work and achieved great success.

    They have discovered mineral veins with excellent quality and abundant reserves in many places in the mountainous areas of our country, such as North Pyongan Province, Jagang Province, and South Hamgyong Province; this year we have newly built and expanded more than a dozen mines.

    As a result of the creative labor struggle of metallurgical industry workers in our country, various enterprises in the metallurgical industry sector have completed or overfulfilled the production plan for the first quarter of this year, and the output has increased by 77.3% compared with the first quarter of 1955.

    Among the metallurgical industry workers in our country, many labor heroes such as Zhao Doushi, Zheng Renbi, and Han Jichan, and thousands of advanced producers have emerged; they are playing a core role in the postwar reconstruction and construction cause. They have put forward thousands of creative opinions and rationalization proposals and applied them to production, creating tens of millions of yuan of wealth for the country, thus further accelerating the speed of completing the people's economic plan.

    The reason why metallurgical workers have been able to achieve such brilliant achievements in the struggle of postwar recovery and construction is due to the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government, and the selfless assistance and support of fraternal countries headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

    However, the above-mentioned achievements are only the starting point of our country's struggle to realize socialist industrialization.

    The Korean Workers' Party's policies, decisions, and instructions for realizing socialist industrialization in our country are the combat program of the Korean Professional League and the guide for workers' lives and activities.

    Because the Korean metallurgical industry workers know that completing the three-year plan ahead of schedule and overfulfilling it will become the material basis for completing the peaceful reunification of the motherland and will become a huge contribution to improving the people's material and cultural life, they are struggling by exerting all their wisdom and creativity.

    Korean metallurgical industry workers are actively safeguarding Asian and world peace together with the entire Korean people, further consolidating and developing the internationalist friendship and unity with workers all over the world, strengthening the friendship and unity of the working classes of Korea and China, and are determined to strive for the peaceful reunification and independence of the motherland.

　　以更大的劳动成就迎接“五一”节
    朝鲜冶金工业工人职业同盟中央委员会委员长　李亨奎
    我国冶金工业部门的全体职工，在建设社会主义基础的庄严的劳动斗争中，来迎接全世界劳动人民大团结的节日——“五一”节。
    兴南地区工矿企业职工联合会议为了庆祝朝鲜劳动党第三次代表大会的召开，号召在二年零八个月内超额完成三年人民经济计划。冶金工业工人热烈地响应这一号召，掀起了热火朝天的增产竞赛运动。
    在我国黑色冶金工业中占有重要地位的城津炼钢厂、黄海炼钢厂和降仙炼钢厂，在1956年4月中旬已经完成了自己的三年计划；整个冶金工业部门，决心在二年零八个月内完成三年计划，到年底完成1956年计划的110％以上。
    已在今年四月十三日完成了三年计划的降仙炼钢厂电炉工人，在“五一”节前夕为缩短冶炼时间而发挥了高度的创造精神，结果冶炼时间从十九小时缩短到十二小时，每天超额30％以上完成生产计划。黄海炼钢厂的平炉工人也把炼钢时间从十五小时缩短到十二小时零九分，每天都在显著地超额完成自己的生产计划。
    全体职工为了提高劳动生产率、降低成本和节约劳动力，广泛地开展了创造、发明、合理化建议运动，目前已有三千四百件合理化建议采用到生产中，从而使生产工序机械化，节约了许多劳动力。他们为了使劳动生产率比今年计划提高11.2％，使成本比1955年降低12％以上，正在进行着创造性的劳动。
    特别是金策炼钢厂劳动英雄韩基灿，为了节省我国贵重的焦炭，努力改进了操作方法，仅在今年第一季度内就节约了六千七百吨焦炭；他将在今年内节约二万七千吨焦炭，把冶炼效率提高到110％。
    在“五一”节前夕，矿业部门的职工也正在为超额完成战后三年人民经济计划而进行着创造性的劳动斗争。
    成川矿山凿岩工李赞道所领导的作业班，由于开展了采用复式穿孔作业法和规格爆破作业法和多看管机器的运动，过去四个人的工作现在三个人就可以完成了，采矿指标从二十四吨提高到三十二吨，提前五十三天完成了年度生产计划；他们并提出多开采八百多吨的奋斗目标，现在他们正胜利地完成着计划。
    在战争艰苦的环境中由于采用阶段式采矿法而创造了生产新纪录的检德凿岩工、劳动英雄赵斗实，采矿量从三十吨提高到九百五十二吨，生产效率提高到3，170％；由于我们大力推广了他的经验，在开发地下资源方面取得了巨大的成就。
    厚昌矿山凿岩工、劳动英雄车昌先，成兴矿山凿岩工朴镇焕，成川矿山张士俊等数百名采矿工，都采用了阶段式采矿法，他们决定在迎接“五一”节时完成1956年度的生产计划。
    地质勘查部门的工人和技术人员改进了地质勘查工作，取得了巨大的成就。
    他们在我国山岳地带的平安北道、慈江道、咸镜南道等许多地方，发现了矿质优良、蕴藏量丰富的矿脉；今年我们已新建和扩建了十几个矿山。
    由于我国冶金工业工人创造性的劳动斗争的结果，冶金工业部门的各企业都完成或超额完成了今年第一季度的生产计划，产量比1955年第一季度提高了77.3％。
    在我国冶金工业工人中，涌现出赵斗实、郑仁弼、韩基灿等许多劳动英雄和数千名先进生产者；他们在战后的恢复建设事业中，正起着核心作用。他们提出了数千件创造性的意见和合理化建议，并把它们应用到生产上，为国家多创造了数千万元的财富，因而更加加快了完成人民经济计划的速度。
    在战后恢复建设的斗争中，冶金工人所以能取得如此辉煌的成就，是由于有朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的正确领导，有以苏联和中华人民共和国为首的兄弟国家的无私援助和支持。
    但是，上述的成就只不过是我国为实现社会主义工业化的斗争的起点而已。
    朝鲜劳动党为实现我国社会主义工业化的政策、决定和指示，是朝鲜职业同盟的战斗纲领，是工人生活和活动的指针。
    由于朝鲜冶金工业工人知道提前并超额完成三年计划将成为完成祖国和平统一的物质基础，将成为提高人民物质文化生活的巨大贡献，所以他们正发挥自己的一切智慧和创造性进行斗争。
    朝鲜冶金工业工人正和全体朝鲜人民在一起，积极维护亚洲和世界和平，更加巩固并发展同全世界工人的国际主义的友好团结，加强朝中两国工人阶级的友谊和团结，并决心要争取祖国的和平统一和独立。
