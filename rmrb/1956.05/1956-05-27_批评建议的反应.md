Reactions to Criticisms and Suggestions

    Letter from the Agricultural Machinery Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture: We accept the criticism in the "Letters from Readers" page on April 30 regarding our bureau's failure to hold meetings on the scheduled date. After our bureau issued a notice convening a meeting on hillside plows, we temporarily decided to hold a symposium on rice transplanters due to the announcement of the invention of the rice transplanter by the Huazhong Agricultural Science Research Institute, and postponed the hillside plow meeting. It was wrong to issue the postponement notice too late, causing a waste of time for the meeting representatives.

    Letter from the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Railways: The "Letters from Readers" page published a letter on July 3rd last year entitled "The Railway System's Free Ticket System is Riddled with Malpractices." Starting this year, with the approval of the State Council, our ministry has implemented a new free ticket system. The number of free tickets for personal use by railway staff has been reduced to two per year, and supervision of their use has been strengthened. Because many readers have recently written to express their opinions on the original free ticket system, we would like to provide an explanation.

    Letter from the Housing and Construction Department of the Harbin Railway Administration: The criticism in the "Letters from Readers" page on March 11 regarding the poor quality of self-built public-assisted housing by the Mudanjiang Branch is correct. Due to insufficient leadership and supervision of the self-built housing work of various branches, coupled with a lack of experience and late construction timing, the quality of housing is generally poor. We have now allocated 30,000 yuan from the Administration's leadership fund to repair the leaking houses.

专栏：批评建议的反应

    批评建议的反应
    农业部农业机械管理总局来信：我们接受四月三十日“读者来信专页”对我局不按规定日期开会的批评。我局通知召开山地犁会议以后，由于华中农业科学研究所发明插秧机消息公布，又临时决定开插秧机座谈会，而将山地犁会议延期。因为延期开会的通知发得太晚，以致耽误了开会代表的时间，这是很不应该的。
    铁道部总务处来信：去年七月三日“读者来信专页”发表了“流弊多端的铁路系统免票制度”一信。从今年开始，我部已经国务院批准实行新的免票制度，铁路工作人员私用免费票每年减为两张，同时加强使用中的监督工作。因为最近还有不少读者来信对原来的免票制度提意见，因此希望说明一下。
    哈尔滨铁路管理局房产建筑处来信：三月十一日“读者来信专页”对牡丹江分局自建公助住宅质量低劣提出的批评是正确的。由于我们对各分局自建住宅工作的领导和监督不够，加上缺乏经验，施工时间较晚，所以住宅质量普遍不好。现在我们已经从管理局首长基金中拨款三万元修补破漏的房屋。
