Scientific Research at Peking University
"May Fourth" Scientific Symposium

The scientific symposium held by Peking University, starting from the 58th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement, concluded on the 12th.

A total of ninety-three papers were presented at this scientific symposium, fifty of which were in the field of natural sciences and forty-three in the field of humanities. In the discussions of the department branches of the scientific symposium, opinions were generally put forward on the quality, advantages, and disadvantages of the papers, and many visitors from outside the university also participated in the discussions.

Some of the papers were theoretical explorations, such as the study of "The Vortex Structure of Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence in the Final Stage of Decay" by Professor Zhou Peiyuan and Cai Shutang, a research intern from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Some papers were closely related to practice, such as "The Vortex Motion Equation in a Baroclinic Atmosphere and Its Application in Weather Forecasting" by Professor Xie Yibing and teaching assistant Chen Qiushi of the Meteorology Department, which made valuable supplements to the calculation of the vortex motion equation in meteorology. Some papers in the humanities were academic criticisms.

Among the more than ninety papers reported in the department branch sessions of the scientific symposium, half were by young teachers or involved young teachers in the research.

Research on Whether Gravitational Waves Exist

Professor Hu Ning reported on "The Problem of Gravitational Waves" at the Physics Division meeting of the Scientific Symposium on May 5th.

In the general theory of relativity, scientists have proposed two different views on the nature of the gravitational field. One view is that the gravitational field is purely a geometric property of time and space; the other view is that the gravitational field, like the electromagnetic field, is a form of matter. If there are gravitational waves, it indicates that there is a process of movement of matter in the gravitational field. The second view above is correct.

In his research, Professor Hu Ning proved through detailed calculations and analysis that gravitational waves can theoretically exist. This result provides new theoretical arguments that will promote the resolution of the essential problem of the gravitational field.

Shorten the Time for Analyzing Tungsten Ore, etc.

It takes more than ten hours to determine the content of tungsten and molybdenum in ore using the gravimetric method for each sample. In order to find a rapid volumetric method for determining high-content tungsten and molybdenum ores, Gao Xiaoxia, an associate professor in the Department of Chemistry, guided young teachers Dai Shugui and Zheng Shuhui to study the potentiometric titration method of chromous chloride to determine the content of tungsten in some domestic tungsten concentrates and molybdenum in molybdenite.

The results of their research proved that accurate results comparable to the gravimetric method can be obtained using an uncompensated potentiometric titration method at room temperature, but the time spent on measuring each sample is only within three hours.

In the future, they will conduct further research with production units to apply this method to actual production, so as to greatly shorten the time required for analyzing tungsten ore and molybdenum ore.

They presented a report on this research at the Chemistry Division of the Scientific Symposium on May 6th.

Professor Feng Youlan's Self-Criticism

Professor Feng Youlan of the Philosophy Department presented a report entitled "Self-Criticism of Past Work in the History of Philosophy" at the first plenary meeting of the Scientific Symposium on May 4th.

Professor Feng Youlan said that the significance of his past work in the history of Chinese philosophy was to cover up class struggle and oppose the Marxist dialectical materialism and historical materialism. He particularly criticized the six philosophical books he wrote during the War of Resistance Against Japan, such as "New Rational Philosophy," "New Original Man," and "New Original Way," which combined feudal philosophical ideas with bourgeois ideas.

While Professor Feng Youlan made his self-criticism, Wang Zisong, an associate professor in the Department of Philosophy, presented a report entitled "Criticism of Mr. Feng Youlan's Past Philosophical Thoughts."

On the Typical Image of Jia Baoyu

On May 6th, Professor Wu Zuxiang reported on his paper "On the Typical Image of Jia Baoyu" at the Chinese Department of the Scientific Symposium.

In this paper, Professor Wu Zuxiang made a relatively in-depth analysis of the formation, development, and limitations of Jia Baoyu's ideological character. The paper includes the author's insights from several years of research on "Dream of the Red Chamber."

During the discussion, the speakers unanimously affirmed the value of this paper. However, many people raised different or supplementary opinions on certain points, such as whether Jia Baoyu reflects the budding of capitalism in Chinese feudal society, and the so-called class inferiority of Jia Baoyu.

    科学研究在北京大学
    “五四”科学讨论会
    北京大学从“五四”五十八周年校庆起举行的科学讨论会，十二日结束。
    在这次科学讨论会上共提出论文九十三篇，其中属自然科学方面的五十篇，人文科学方面的四十三篇。在科学讨论会各系分会讨论中，一般都针对论文的质量和优缺点提出意见，不少校外来宾也参加讨论。
    论文中有些是属于理论上的探讨性的，如周培源教授和中国科学院研究实习员蔡树棠合作的“均匀各面同性湍流在终期衰变时的涡性结构”的研究。有些论文是密切联系实际的，如气象专业谢义炳教授和助教陈秋士合作的“叙压大气中的涡旋运动方程及其在天气预报中的应用”，对气象学上的计算涡旋运动方程作了有价值的补充。人文科学的论文中有些是属于学术批判方面的。
    在科学讨论会各系分会报告的九十多篇论文中，青年教师和有青年教师参加研究的论文占半数。

    研究有无引力波
    胡宁教授在科学讨论会物理分会五月五日的会议上报告了“关于引力波的问题”。
    在广义相对论中，科学家们对引力场的本质提出过两种不同的看法。一种看法认为引力场纯粹是时间和空间的几何性质；另一种看法认为引力场同电磁场一样，是物质的一种形态。如果有引力波，则表明引力场中存在着物质的运动过程。上述第二种看法是正确的。
    胡宁教授在研究中，经过详细的计算和分析，证明引力波在理论上是可以存在的。这个结果提供了新的理论论据，将促进对引力场本质问题的解决。

    缩短分析钨矿石等的时间
    用重量法测定矿石中钨和钼的含量，每测定一个试样需十小时以上。为了寻找测定高含量钨矿石和钼矿石的快速容量法，化学系副教授高小霞指导青年教师戴树桂、郑淑蕙研究氯化亚铬的电位滴定法，测定了一些国产钨精砂中钨的含量和辉钼矿中钼的含量。
    他们研究的结果证明，在室温下用不补偿的电位滴定法，可以得到和重量法相同的精确结果，但每测定一个试样所花的时间只在三小时以内。
    今后他们将和生产单位共同进一步研究，把这个方法应用到实际生产中去，以大大缩短分析钨矿石、钼矿石所需的时间。
    五月六日在科学讨论会化学分会上，他们提出了这项研究的报告。　（华彤文）
    冯友兰教授自我批判
    哲学系教授冯友兰五月四日在科学讨论会第一次全体会议上，以“过去哲学史工作底自我批判”为题提出了报告。
    冯友兰教授说，他过去的中国哲学史工作的意义，是掩盖阶级斗争，反对马克思主义的辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义。他特别批判了抗日战争期间他写的“新理学”、“新原人”、“新原道”等六本以封建主义哲学思想跟资产阶级思想结合的哲学书。
    在冯友兰教授自我批判的同时，哲学系副教授汪子嵩提出了“批判冯友兰先生过去的哲学思想”的报告。
    论贾宝玉的典型形象
    五月六日，在科学讨论会中文系分会上吴组缃教授报告了他的论文“论贾宝玉典型形象”。
    吴组缃教授在这篇论文中对贾宝玉的思想性格的形成、发展和限制，都作了比较深刻的分析。论文包括了作者自己几年来研究“红楼梦”的心得。
    讨论中，发言的人一致肯定这篇论文的价值。但对其中的某些论点，如贾宝玉是否反映了中国封建社会的资本主义萌芽的问题，关于贾宝玉的所谓阶级自卑感的问题等，许多人提出了不同的或补充的意见。　（吕德申）
