Xinhua News Agency report:

　　Students Dai Shihai and Zhang Jiemin, third-year students in the medical department of Jiangxi Medical College, were commended by the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the New Democratic Youth League and the Youth League organization of the medical college at a meeting held on May 4th to celebrate Youth Day for developing an amplifying stethoscope.

　　The amplifying stethoscope they developed was based on a broadcast stethoscope previously trial-produced by a professor of internal medicine at the college and further researched and improved. Its cost is one-thirteenth of that of the broadcast stethoscope, but its effect is greater than that of the broadcast stethoscope. In addition to allowing more than ten people to listen at the same time, it can also amplify the sound at any time, allowing more people to clearly hear the patient's lung and heart sounds.

　　They are now further improving the parts to more accurately amplify lung and heart sounds.

　　江西医学院学生制成扩音听诊机
    在江西医学院四日举行的庆祝“五四”青年节大会上，制成扩音听诊机的医疗系三年级学生戴世海和张杰民受到新民主主义青年团江西省委和这个医学院青年团组织的表扬。
    他们制做的扩音听诊机，是在这个学院的一个内科教授从前试制的广播听诊器的基础上，进一步研究成功的。它的成本相当于广播听诊器的十三分之一，作用却比广播听诊器大。它除能供十多人同时听诊外，还能随时把声音放大，使更多的人清楚地听到病人的肺、心音。
    现在他们正在进一步改进机件，以便更准确地扩大肺、心音。
