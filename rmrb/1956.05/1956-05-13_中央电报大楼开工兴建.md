Construction Begins on Central Telegraph Building

The construction of the Central Telegraph Building began on May 8th on West Chang'an Avenue in Beijing.

The entire building is a seven-story "mountain"-shaped structure, with a clock tower above the seventh floor, bringing the total height of the building to approximately 55 meters. The equipment installed in the building will be the most modern, which can improve the quality of telegraph communication, reduce errors, and speed up transmission.

After the completion of this building, it will become the nerve center of our country's international telegraph communication and domestic telegraph exchanges.

Thanks to the support of the Beijing municipal leadership and the efforts of the Beijing Industrial Architecture Design Institute and process designers, this telegraph building will be completed ahead of schedule. After it begins operations, it will open up user telegraph and voice-transmitted telegraph services, allowing users to send telegrams from their offices or homes using telephones. At the same time, it also plans to expand facsimile telegraphs, enabling residents of many major cities to use this type of telegraph to transmit pictures or photographs. The building also has equipment for holding long-distance telephone conferences. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    中央电报大楼开工兴建
    中央电报大楼八日在北京西长安街开工兴建。
    整个大楼是一座“山”字形的七层大厦，七层以上是钟塔，楼的总高约达五十五公尺。大楼内装置的机器都将是最新式的，它们可以提高电报通讯质量，减少差错，加快传递速度。
    这座大楼建成以后，将成为我国在国际间电报通讯和国内电报往来的神经中枢。
    由于北京市领导机关的支持和北京工业建筑设计院及工艺设计人员的努力，这座电报大楼将比原计划提前建成。它在开始营业以后，将开辟用户电报和话传电报，用户们在机关内或在住宅里，利用电话就能发出电报。同时，它还准备扩大传真电报，使许多主要城市的居民可以用这种电报来传送图片或照片。楼内还有召开长途电话会议的设备。（据新华社讯）
