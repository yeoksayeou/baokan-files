From the first day we set foot on Hungarian soil, we have lived in the sincere affection of the Hungarian people's infinite love for the Chinese people. Every scene that constitutes this touching friendship will be indelible forever.

Whether it is the workers on Csepel Island with a glorious tradition of revolutionary struggle, the farmers on the Great Hungarian Plain who have firmly embarked on the road of cooperation, the staff of party and state organs standing at various posts, or the journalists, nursery staff, cultural workers, etc. with different occupations that we have directly and indirectly contacted, all unanimously care about the great steps of the Chinese people in building a new life, just as they care about the construction of their own homeland. What is particularly impressive is that the recent rapid development of China's agricultural cooperation has aroused widespread joy and interest among the Hungarian people. As soon as we entered the gate of the Liberation Cooperative, one of the earliest agricultural production cooperatives in Hungary, the chairman of the cooperative said bluntly: "From the radio broadcast, we know that China's agricultural cooperation is advancing at such a fast speed, we are very happy, but at the same time we are also very surprised, but after careful consideration, it is not surprising, because the Chinese people have gone through decades of revolutionary struggle and are rich in revolutionary tradition and innovative spirit"; not only the members of the cooperatives we visited and many farmers showed a natural concern for China's agricultural cooperation, but also the other people we contacted were no exception. Therefore, such touching episodes often occur, and our visits to Hungarian comrades finally turned into their visits to us, and one of the themes must be the issue of China's agricultural cooperation. On the sunny morning of April 20, we went to the Ministry of Culture to learn about the cultural life in Hungary. Before we closed our notebooks, some of the comrades took out notebooks to prepare to record the progress of China's agricultural cooperation. In addition, other issues related to the socialist transformation of rural areas, such as the Chinese Communist Party's policy towards landlords and rich peasants, are also frequent topics. In this case, it is completely understandable that we often hear Hungarian comrades talk about the "National Agricultural Development Program" proposed by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong's "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation".

The Hungarian people's concern for all aspects of China's socialist construction and socialist transformation is very moving. The steelworkers of the Stalin Metallurgical Complex in Varos care about the construction of Chinese steel plants and the time it takes to make a furnace of steel; when several Hungarian comrades heard us say that China would manufacture its first car before October 1, they quickly patted us on the shoulders and said with excitement: "Good!" "Good!"; Party workers inquired in great detail about China's policies, steps and specific methods for uniting and educating intellectuals and carrying out socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises; the Party Committee Secretary of the Budapest Film Studio cared about the quality and quantity of Chinese films; A very meaningful fact is that from the cadres of the Ministry of Culture to the old farmers who are already half a hundred years old, they all care about China's writing reform, and many people care about when China will use phonetic writing. Later we learned that the reason why Hungarian comrades are so concerned about China's writing reform is because a considerable number of people want to learn Chinese to learn more about China, but now, as Hungarian comrades said: "It is really too difficult to learn so many different symbols in a short period of time."

The reason why the Hungarian people are eager to understand all aspects of the Chinese people's life is because the Hungarian people understand that China, with its 600 million people, is a brother who is advancing side by side with it towards the same great goal. Of course, it should also be estimated that for a long period of time before the Chinese and Hungarian people took control of their own destiny, there was almost no contact and communication between the two peoples. If some books about China were published in Hungary before liberation, then these books could neither reflect the actual life of China nor help to truly understand China. Now, although we have only made a short stay in Hungary, we have already felt that the Hungarian Party and the State have made great efforts to enable the Hungarian people to understand the struggles and lives of the Chinese people: newspapers and magazines often publish articles, news reports, pictures and news about China. "Free People's Daily", the central organ of the Hungarian Working People's Party, has a Hungarian comrade who understands Chinese and studies Chinese newspapers and magazines, and writes articles about the life of the Chinese people; On newsstands in Budapest, you can see picture books entitled "China", which were photographed and written by Hungarian journalists who have visited China, and it is said that the second volume will be published soon; In the home of a scholar, he showed us the Hungarian version of Mao Zedong's Selected Works, which was full of annotations and underlined; At the university, Mao Zedong's Selected Works has been used as a must-read reference book for every student to study theory; In the office of the Ministry of Culture, Hungarian comrades listed the Chinese classical and modern literary works that have been translated into Hungarian: Shi Nai'an's "Water Margin", Bai Juyi, Qu Yuan, Du Fu's poems, Selected Poems from the Book of Songs, Lu Xun's "Call to Arms", Mao Dun's "Midnight", Zhou Libo's "The Hurricane", etc.; At the University of Budapest, there are courses teaching Chinese, and now there are more than 30 Hungarian students; Hungarian comrades also told us that lectures on China are often held in cultural centers in Budapest and other cities: such as the history of the Chinese workers' movement, Chinese drama literature, music, etc.; Last year, the first Chinese museum in Hungarian history was established in Budapest. These events make people deeply believe that the Hungarian people regard the Chinese people as their own brothers.

Another proof of this brotherly close relationship is that all the factories, rural areas, organs, cultural palaces, and clubs we visited treated the Chinese as brothers who had been reunited after a long separation. Almost every meeting broke the scheduled schedule. The meeting with the farmers in Felsőtárkány town, Heves County, was a sincere expression of the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people. We were scheduled to return to Eger, the capital of Heves County, from the town at 9:00 p.m. The clock had long passed 9:00. The warm and hospitable hosts, who had friendly feelings for the Chinese people, earnestly asked us to stay for another ten minutes again and again. If ten minutes was not possible, five minutes would be fine. We also walked out of the door again and again and were persuaded to stay. Their earnest expressions and reluctance deeply touched our hearts. These residents, who are not only warm and hospitable, but also particularly good at folk songs and dances, performed singing and dancing for the Chinese guests time and time again. Even a 62-year-old woman came to the stage to perform the dance she was good at when she was young. By the time we returned to the capital of the state, it was almost midnight. The Deputy Governor and the state's working comrades were still waiting to talk and have fun with the Chinese guests. They not only took out the most precious wine, but also used the most respectful way for Hungarians to entertain guests to sing and dance with the Chinese guests. The Deputy Governor personally led the singing of folk songs and pulled the Chinese guests to dance folk dances together. In this symbolic meeting, we exchanged so much extraordinary friendship, and our hearts were excited all day long in the warmth of the friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people. When we shook hands tightly to say goodbye, the Hungarian comrades said in unison: "You know how much we love the great Chinese people!" From this short and simple sentence, people can clearly see the great proletarian internationalism of this country with a glorious tradition of revolutionary struggle and a love of freedom and friendship, which has been developing day by day in the eleven years since liberation.

Everywhere in Hungary, you can hear the sentence: "Visiting China is my greatest yearning." This sentence also expresses the Hungarian people's love for the Chinese people and their desire to know more about China to a certain extent. A Hungarian comrade summarized this universal yearning as "There are many, many people who want to go to China, and there is not a single person who does not want to go to China." In this case, the Hungarian comrades who returned home after visiting China have become enthusiastic propagandists of the Chinese situation. Some people describe these comrades as "talking day and night, but still not finishing", and we have also heard many stories about these enthusiastic propagandists. It can be said without exaggeration that these comrades have done their best for the cause of friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people.

The deepening brotherly friendship between the Hungarian and Chinese people will not only have a beneficial impact on the great cause of building socialism in the two countries, but also play an important role in the consolidation and strengthening of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and in the cause of defending peace of the entire progressive mankind. May the friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people be as evergreen as pine and cypress trees and last as long as the Danube and the Yangtze River.

    兄弟般的情谊
    黄操良　胡思升
    从踏上匈牙利国土的第一天起，我们就生活在匈牙利人民无限热爱中国人民的真挚的感情里。构成这种动人友谊的每一个情景，将是永远不能磨灭的。
    无论是有着光荣革命斗争传统的蔡贝尔岛上的工人，无论是已经坚定地走上合作化道路的阿尔弗德大平原上的农民，无论是站在各种不同岗位上的党和国家机关的工作人员，或者是我们直接和间接接触过的新闻工作者、托儿所工作人员、文化工作者等等有着不同职业的人们，都一致地像关怀自己家园的建设一样，殷切地关心着中国人民建设新生活的巨大步伐。给人印象特别深刻的是，近来中国农业合作化事业的飞速发展，在匈牙利人民中间引起了普遍的喜悦和兴趣。我们刚进入匈牙利最早的生产合作社之一——解放合作社的大门，这个合作社的主席劈头就说：“从收音机的广播里，知道中国农业合作化以这样快的速度前进，我们很高兴，但同时也很惊奇，可是仔细一想也觉得不奇怪，因为中国人民经过几十年的革命斗争，是富有革命传统和革新精神的”；不仅我们访问过的合作社的社员和不少农民对中国农业合作化表现出理所当然的关怀，我们接触过的其他人们也不例外。因此经常发生这样动人的插曲，我们对匈牙利同志的访问最后变成了他们对我们的访问，而其中的主题之一，一定是中国的农业合作化问题。四月二十日一个晴朗的上午，去文化部了解匈牙利文化生活的情况，当我们还没有合拢我们的记录本，他们有的同志就拿出笔记本准备记录中国农业合作化的进展情况了。此外，在有关农村的社会主义改造的其他问题上，譬如中国党对地主、富农分子的政策等等问题，也是经常的话题。在这种情况下，我们经常听到匈牙利同志谈起中共中央政治局提出的“全国农业发展纲要”和毛泽东同志的“关于农业合作化问题”，就是完全可以理解的了。
    匈牙利人民对中国社会主义建设和社会主义改造的各个方面的关怀，是十分令人感动的。瓦罗斯城斯大林冶金联合工厂的炼钢工人关心中国炼钢工厂的建设和炼一炉钢的时间；好几个匈牙利同志听我们说起中国将在十月一日前自己制造出第一辆汽车的时候，连忙拍着我们的肩激情地说：“好！”“好！”；党的工作人员十分详细地询问中国团结、教育知识分子以及对私营工商业实行社会主义改造的政策、步骤和具体办法；布达佩斯电影制片厂的党委书记则关心中国影片的质量和数量；一个很有意味的事实是，从文化部的干部一直到年已半百的老农民，都关怀中国的文字改革，很多人关心中国什么时候用拼音文字书写。后来我们了解到，匈牙利同志所以如此关心中国的文字改革，是因为有相当多的人想学习中文从而更多地了解中国，但是现在，正像匈牙利同志所说的：“要在较短的时间里学会这么多彼此不同的符号，实在是太困难了”。
    匈牙利人民所以迫切要求了解中国人民各方面的生活，这是因为匈牙利人民懂得：有着六万万人口的中国是和它并肩向着同样伟大目标前进的兄弟。当然还应该估计到，在中匈两国人民掌握自己命运以前的一段长时期里，我们两国人民几乎没有什么接触和来往，如果说在解放以前的匈牙利也出版过有关中国的书籍的话，那么这些书籍是既不能反映中国的实际生活，又不能有助于对中国的真正了解的。而现在，虽然我们在匈牙利只作了短促的逗留，就已经感到匈牙利党和国家作了重大的努力来使本国人民了解中国人民的斗争和生活：报纸和杂志经常刊登有关中国的论文、通讯、图片和新闻，匈牙利劳动人民党中央机关报“自由人民报”专门有一位懂中文的匈牙利同志研究中国的报章杂志，撰写有关中国人民生活的文章；在布达佩斯的报摊上，到处都可以看见题为“中国”的图文并茂的小册子，这是访问过中国的匈牙利记者摄影和撰写的，听说不久就要出版第二册了；在学者的家庭里，他把上面满是批注和划线的毛泽东选集匈文版拿给我们看；在大学里，毛泽东选集已作为每个学生学习理论的必读参考书；在文化部的办公室里，匈牙利同志列举着已译成匈文的中国古典和现代的文艺著作：施耐庵的“水浒”、白居易、屈原、杜甫的诗集、诗经选集、鲁迅的“呐喊”、茅盾的“子夜”、周立波的“暴风骤雨”等等；在布达佩斯大学里，有讲授中文的课程，现在有三十多位匈牙利学生；匈牙利同志还告诉我们：在布达佩斯和各城市的文化馆里，经常举办有关中国的讲座：如中国的工人运动史、中国的戏剧文学、音乐等等；去年，在布达佩斯建立了匈牙利历史上第一个中国博物馆。这些事件使人们深深地相信：匈牙利人民是把中国人民当作亲兄弟看待的。
    这种兄弟般亲密关系的又一证明是：凡是我们去访问的工厂、农村、机关、文化宫、俱乐部，都把中国人当作久别重逢的兄弟来接待。几乎每一次的会见都打破了预定时间表的规定。在海威斯州费尔斯塔尔加妮镇和农民的会见，是中匈两国人民兄弟般友谊的真挚表现。我们预定晚上九时从该镇回海威斯州首府艾格尔城的。时针早已走过九时了，对中国人民怀着友好感情的热情而好客的主人，一次又一次恳切地留我们再待十分钟，如果十分钟不行，五分钟也是好的，我们也一次次地走出大门又被挽留下来，他们那种恳切的表情和依依不舍的神情深深地打动了我们的心。这些不仅热情而好客，而且特别善于富有民间色彩的歌舞的居民，一次次地给中国客人表演歌唱和舞蹈，连六十二岁的老太太也上台表演她年青时拿手的舞蹈了，等我们回到州的首府，已经快近午夜，副州长和州的工作同志还在等待同中国客人交谈和联欢，他们不仅拿出最名贵的酒，而且用匈牙利招待客人最尊敬的做法和中国客人一起歌唱和舞蹈，副州长亲自领头唱民间歌曲，并拉中国客人一起跳民间舞。在这一次有象征意义的会见中，我们交流了那么多不平常的友情，我们彼此的心一整天都在中匈两国人民友爱的温暖中激动。当我们双手紧握着准备告别时，匈牙利同志异口同声地说：“你们知道我们是多么热爱伟大的中国人民啊！”从这一句简短而又朴素的话里，使人清晰地看到这个有着光荣革命斗争传统的、酷爱自由和友谊的国家在解放十一年来日益发展着的无产阶级国际主义的伟大胸怀。
    在匈牙利到处可以听到这样一句话：“到中国去访问是我最大的向往”。这句话也在一定程度上表达了匈牙利人民热爱中国人民，渴望更多地了解中国的一种真情。一位匈牙利同志把这种普遍的向往概括成“想去中国的人很多很多，不想去中国的人是一个也没有的”。在这种情况下，访问过中国后回国的匈牙利同志，都成为中国情况的热情的宣传家，有人形容这些同志是“白天讲、黑夜讲，还是讲不完”，我们也听说了许多有关这些热情的宣传家的事迹。可以毫不夸张地说，这些同志为中匈两国人民友谊的事业尽了他们最大的力量。
    匈牙利人民和中国人民之间日益发展着的兄弟般的深厚的友谊，不仅将对两国人民建设社会主义的伟大事业发生有利的影响，而且将对以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的巩固和壮大、对整个进步人类保卫和平的事业起重要的作用。愿中匈两国人民的友谊像松柏一样常青，像多瑙河和长江一样常存。
