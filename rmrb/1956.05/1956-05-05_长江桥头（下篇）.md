　　Yangtze River Bridgehead (Part Two)
　　Special Correspondent of this Newspaper: Xu Chi

　　After a night of storm, another look at the riverbank, just as the ancient poem described: "Hanyang trees are clearly visible on Sunny Beach…" The river was already very calm. The morning sun shone on it like a piece of sparkling brocade, as if no storm had ever occurred last night. The scenery on the river and at the bridge pier construction site was clear and unobstructed. Only the river level had risen. The peach blossom flood had arrived.

　　On the bank, at the foot of Pier No. 3, two tender green willow trees were already as bright as jade. On Turtle Mountain behind, peach and plum buds were appearing on the branches, blooming furiously as soon as they saw the sun. People's hearts were the same.

　　Spring had truly arrived.

　　Perhaps the most aware of the arrival of spring were these bridge-studying students from technical colleges and engineering schools, who were sent here for internships. They came to the Yangtze River Bridgehead on the Hanyang bank, with their backs to the tall bridge abutment and facing the magnificent bridge piers in the heart of the river. The sparkling waves on the river reflected onto their faces. White seagulls were flying. They were breathing deeply the air here – the construction site they had long yearned for.

　　Now, some of them had completed their internships, full of knowledge, and were preparing to return. Some had been here for a long time, but still had some questions they didn't understand. A batch had just arrived yesterday. Greeting them was such a storm that frightened them. However, at this moment on the construction site, no one remembered the storm. It hadn't even left a trace.

　　Just now, the chief of the construction technology section of the Bridge Engineering Bureau gave these young people a lesson. What this chief told them was something they could never forget:

　　"The bridge pier construction method adopted on the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge construction site is not available in any textbook or specialized work, and has not been done on any river in the world except here. It is the most advanced method."

　　"You have all studied the pneumatic caisson method, haven't you?" the chief of the construction technology section said. "But the Yangtze River is deep and the current is rapid. It's difficult to use caissons to build bridge piers on such a river, it's simply impossible. The Yangtze River forced us to adopt a new method. The Soviet bridge engineer, Silin, proposed this pipe pile drilling method. This is a bold and pioneering suggestion! We accepted it and carried out a series of experimental work on the bridge, and then officially started construction. Not long ago, after strict appraisal, this new method has been affirmed as a great innovation in the history of bridge building."

　　After such an introduction, he began to talk about the various technical processes related to the "pipe pile drilling method." His introduction really made people's hearts beat faster, filled with excitement and joy. And the technical process, as he described it, was so novel. It was unbelievable, yet reasonable; some parts were difficult to understand, but generally easy to grasp.

　　Now, this group of young people had come to the Yangtze River Bridgehead and saw hundreds and thousands of workers active on the site. They looked around the construction site and it was not completely incomprehensible. They looked up at the iron tower-like cranes and universal pile drivers. They also saw many large floating cranes on the water, and saw wooden rafts and sailboats passing through the towering bridge piers, making the bridge piers appear particularly novel and majestic. They also saw the pipe pile group in the distance, and knew that the so-called new method was this thing. Their faces were filled with joy.

　　They were waiting for an engineer. They found the construction site captain's office, but it was in a meeting.

　　It was a meeting presided over by the deputy chief engineer, with the captain, squad leaders, engineers, and heads of functional units participating. They all expressed that they were ideologically paralyzed about last night's storm beforehand, and therefore were caught off guard at the last minute. Criticisms were made, self-criticisms were given, and some people were commended. It couldn't be said that there was no loss at all. Two wooden barges and the pipe piles on them sank and needed to be pulled up by a floating crane. Two pipe piles on Pier No. 4 were hit by a guide boat and needed to be pulled out and replaced with two new ones.

　　Now, a Soviet expert was speaking. His face was somewhat like Oleg's, like that of the Young Guard. This expert was Silin, the originator of the pipe pile drilling method. In addition to making some criticisms about last night's storm, he particularly pointed out that the river water had begun to rise, and it was estimated that the water level would reach seventeen meters soon. Therefore, the problem of Pier No. 2 was gradually becoming serious. If Pier No. 2 could not be rushed out before the flood, it would affect the entire bridge's construction period. Pier No. 2 was the key, and all machinery should be prioritized for Pier No. 2. "I repeat, machinery must be prioritized for it."

　　After the expert finished speaking, the meeting dispersed.

　　Just as the young people at the bridgehead were getting impatient, a middle-aged man in a railway worker's uniform came. This was Engineer Zhao, who was going to assign work to everyone. The interns applauded him and stood in a circle, quickly surrounding him.

　　"Our place is a great university," he said. "Welcome to you all. Now you are here for an internship. If you come again in the second half of the year, you can officially join the work, and you can learn even better."

　　He knew they were graduating interns, these happy young people! They could come to such a construction site for an internship while they were still students. Engineer Zhao himself when he was young – hey, what was the point of thinking about that?

　　People who had been to the Hanshui Bridgehead two years ago had seen Engineer Zhao. After the Hanshui Bridge was completed, he returned to the design department. Not long ago, he came to the First Bridge Engineering Team of the bridge to serve as the team's chief engineer, responsible for four bridge piers and seventeen bridge abutments. He was slightly fatter than two years ago, but still spoke in Shanghainese-accented Mandarin.

　　The interns' work, he said, was mainly to serve as recorders or assistants to the foremen. They would be assigned to the First Squad, the Drilling Squad, the Base Squad, and the Electromechanical Squad. Today, on their first day, they should take a look, starting with Pier No. 4 and working backwards one by one, until they saw Pier No. 1, so they could see the whole process.

　　After clarifying the interns' work assignment, Engineer Zhao hurried to Pier No. 2. Hadn't the expert warned at the meeting just now?

　　The interns took a motorboat to Pier No. 4.

　　Pier No. 4 was a large steel structure called a steel casing, shaped like a spider web, but a three-dimensional spider web. More than thirty large pipe piles would be inserted into the middle of it in the future. It was four or five stories high. But it would sink to the bottom of the river. It played the role of fixing the position for the future bridge pier.

　　On the platform above Pier No. 4, the young people surrounded Squad Leader Shi again. He was responsible for Piers No. 3 and No. 4.

　　Squad Leader Shi began to talk to them. Somehow, the topic quickly turned to the pneumatic caisson method. Squad Leader Shi said that he had been a caisson worker more than thirty years ago. The young people were extremely happy and asked him many questions.

　　For more than a hundred years, caissons have generally been used to build bridges in deep-water rivers. Many famous bridges in the world have been built using this method. But the young people did not expect this old worker to be so disgusted with it.

　　Squad Leader Shi described to them how he worked in the caisson:

　　"People enter the first door, 'Click! Click!' It is closed. Then the wind comes, that is, compressed air comes. As the wind comes, the door is tightened, and the air pressure increases from one to two, three, and more than three. People can't stand it anymore. Their hearts are uncomfortable, their ears hurt, their joints also ache faintly, and sometimes their eyes and noses bleed. When the air pressure in this room increases to balance the air pressure in the inner room, the second door opens slowly. The caisson workers enter the inner room and go down from the three doors on the floor. A ladder leads all the way to the deep water below. You go down dozens of meters deep, and the air compressor supplies you with air to breathe. When you reach the riverbed, you dig soil and push mud. In such a caisson, you can't see the sun, the lights are dim, it's not a human world. You are covered in mud, and you can't stay down for more than forty minutes. You become mud ghosts when you go up. So we caisson workers have a saying: 'Eat the food of the Yang world, do the work of the Yin world!' You know, it's inevitable that people will be sacrificed in the caisson. You don't know how many people die to build a deep-water bridge!"

　　Squad Leader Shi closed his eyes, thinking, as if saying that there was no need to talk more, there were plenty of tragic things. Then, he opened his eyes and shuddered. Suddenly, the frown disappeared, and he smiled. "Now?" he asked.

　　He raised his arm and drew a circle. They were in the heart of the Yangtze River, on a high circular platform, Pier No. 4, rising more than ten meters above the river. The scenery of the great river was all under his arm. Thousands of sails were unfurled on the river. Tugboats and ships in single file and pushing style were passing through the not-very-wide channel. You could see the large impact drilling rig on Pier No. 5, and you could also see the vibrating pile driver on Pier No. 3.

　　"Now, people are comfortable, but in the past, people suffered! Now, people don't have to go down to the bottom of the water, don't have to go into the caisson, don't have to live on compressed air! We are above the water, we can see everywhere. That's so good! In the past, the deeper you went, the weaker you became, but now, the more you work, the stronger you become!"

　　Squad Leader Shi smiled. His face was very expressive, and his actions and language were very rhythmic. His short beard made him very lovable.

　　"Now you understand, right? The pneumatic caisson method is not good. Our pipe pile drilling method is so great! Our workers support it, you see, it gives us such good working conditions. People are the most precious, safety first is the most important thing. Now, if the corridors in our pier are not good, and the railings are not strong, we will be criticized by the Soviet experts..."

　　At this moment, Foreman Feng Sen suddenly ran over:

　　"Squad Leader Shi, there's a phone call to transfer our floating crane! Pier No. 2 needs it!"

　　"Oh dear! What should we do!" he said, looking a little anxious.

　　Once he encountered work, no force could make him let go of it. "We'll talk later," he said to the interns. After speaking, he went down the platform, passed through the corridor, and went to answer the phone.

　　The interns had no choice but to go to Pier No. 3. Pier No. 3 was the simplest in appearance. A steel circular wall, called a steel sheet pile, rose from the river, like a water fortress. A high lookout tower, which was actually a power distribution room, rose next to it. The river water flowed here with a rush, and flocks of seagulls flew past the motorboats.

　　When they stepped on the wooden barge next to Pier No. 3, they saw:

　　"Pipe Piles!"

　　Looking at them from a distance and up close was completely different. Up close, they realized how thick they were.

　　Ah, pipe piles, large-diameter reinforced concrete pipe piles, the most important thing in this new method. They were as thick as hundred-year-old trees, and lying horizontally they were taller than them. Because these pipe piles were one point five five meters in diameter.

　　When they passed the two ends of the pipe piles, they all peeped through them, like looking through a telescope, and saw the circular scenery of the shore, the river, or the pier. They were astonished and delighted, climbed into the enclosure, and saw that the inside was a wide space. On the circular platform, twenty or thirty people were busy, and there were giant python-like water jets everywhere.

　　All of this was an unimaginable magical experience. At this moment, a thirty-five-ton floating crane stretched out a steel arm from the river outside, and lowered a large pipe pile from above their heads. This nine-meter-high, eleven-ton heavy pipe pile would be sunk straight to the bottom of the river, through the silt cover layer, until it reached the bedrock below.

　　"Start!" someone shouted. Several motors whirred. The young interns saw another large pipe pile standing straight on the platform suddenly sink, shortening itself, shortening more, shortening more.

　　They saw this pipe pile, its water jets, and a huge machine on top of it, and knew that this was the so-called vibrating pile driver. This pipe pile kept sinking, almost level with the platform, and it would be invisible if it sank further.

　　"Stop!" people shouted, whistles blew. The motors stopped, but the floating crane started to rotate its steel arm again, lowering the large pipe pile that had just been lowered even lower, and making it connect to the one that had already mostly sunk.

　　This was wonderful collaboration, the poetry of labor. A Soviet expert once praised such an operation: "It's as skilled as the performance of actors!" No wonder all the young interns were stunned.

　　They saw Pier No. 2 and Pier No. 1 from Pier No. 3. Seeing such a great socialist construction, and that in the near future they would put on rattan hats, pick up record clips, and start participating in this construction life, expressions of joy and admiration did not leave their faces all day.

　　长江桥头（下篇）
    本报特约记者　徐迟
    一夜风暴过后，再到江边一看，正如古诗所描写的：晴川历历汉阳树……江水已经非常平静了。朝阳照得它像一匹闪光锦缎，就像昨夜晚根本没有发生过什么风暴一样。江上和桥墩工地上，景色鲜明，一览无遗。就是江水上涨了。这是桃汛来了。
    岸边，在三号桥台下，两枝嫩绿的柳树已经绿得像翡翠一样发亮。后面的龟山上，桃李蓓蕾都在枝头出现，一见阳光就怒放。人们的心也一样。
    春天真正来临了。
    也许最能感到春天来临的是这些工学院和工程学校的学桥梁的学生，他们被派到这里来实习。他们来到这汉阳岸的长江桥头，背靠着高大的桥台，面朝着江心雄伟的桥墩。江上的闪耀的波光，一直反射到他们的脸上。白色的海鸥在飞。他们深深地呼吸着这里的空气——他们来到的工地，正是他们想望了很久的。
    现在，他们中间，有的已经实习完毕，满肚子学问，准备回去了。有的来了很久，但是还有些问题没有弄明白。有一批是昨天刚来到。迎接他们的是那样一阵风暴，把他们吓坏了。不过，此刻在工地上，谁也记不得那风暴了。它连什么痕迹也没有留下。
    刚才，大桥工程局的施工技术科长给他们这些青年上了一课。这位科长告诉他们的话，是永远也不能忘记的：
    “在武汉长江大桥工地上所采用的桥墩施工方法是任何一本教科书，任何一本专门著作上都还没有的，除了这里，世界任何河流上也还没有做过的，一个最先进的方法。”
    “你们都学过压气沉箱法了吧”，施工技术科长说，“可是长江水深流急，在这样的河流上用沉箱修筑桥墩就有困难，简直就是不能用。长江迫使我们采用新方法。苏联的桥梁工程师西林，提出了这个管柱钻孔法，这是个大胆的、首创性的建议啊！我们接受了它，在大桥上展开了一系列的试验工作，然后正式开工。不久以前，经过严格的鉴定，这个新方法已被肯定为桥梁史上的伟大革新了。”
    在这样的一番引言之后，他才讲起有关“管柱钻孔法”的各种技术过程。他的引言实在是叫人听了心跳的，兴奋和喜悦的。而技术过程，照他那样讲，又是多么新颖。它不可思议，而又合情合理；有些地方难懂，可是大体上还容易理解。
    现在，这一群青年人来到了长江桥头，看到了成百成千工人在活跃的现场。他们环顾工地，不是完全不能理解的了。他们仰视铁塔似的起重机和万能打桩机。他们又看水上好些大吊船，看到木排和帆船从高耸的桥墩中间通过，显得一座座桥墩特别新奇和雄伟。他们还远远地看到了管柱群，知道所谓新方法就是这东西。他们的脸上就充满了欣喜的颜色。
    他们在等着一位工程师。他们找到了工地队长室里，可是里面正开会。
    这是副总工程师在主持的会议，队长、中队长、工程师、职能单位的负责人都参加了。他们都表示，对于昨夜的风暴，事前思想上是很麻痹的，因此临时措手不及。批评的批评，检讨的检讨，一部分人被表扬了。也不能说一点损失没有，沉了两条木驳和上面的管柱，要用吊船把它们拉起来。四号墩有两根管柱被导向船撞伤了，要拔起来换两根。
    现在，一个苏联专家正在讲话。他的脸型有点儿像奥列格；就像那个青年近卫军。这位专家就是西林，管柱钻孔法的创始者。他除了对昨夜的风暴作了些批评之外，特别指出，江水已经开始上涨，估计不久以后，水位将到十七公尺。因此二号墩的问题逐渐严重。如果不能在洪水之前抢出二号墩来，就要影响整个大桥的工期。二号墩是关键，所有机具应该优先供应二号墩。“我再重复一句，机具要优先供应它。”
    专家讲完后，会就散了。
    桥头的青年人等得正不耐烦的时候，一位穿着铁路职工制服的中年人来了。这就是赵工程师，他要给大家分配工作。实习生们向他鼓掌，站成一圆圈，迅速将他围住。
    “我们这里是个大学校，”他说，“欢迎你们来。现在来是实习，下半年再来，就可以正式参加工作，也可以更加好地学习了。”
    他知道他们是毕业实习生，这些幸福的青年！他们还是学生的时候，就能到这样的工地来实习。赵工程师自己在年轻时候——嘿，想那个做什么呢？
    两年前到过汉水桥头的人都见过赵工程师。汉水桥建成后，他回到设计部门，不久之前，又来到大桥的第一桥梁工程队担任队里的总工程师，负责四只桥墩，十七只桥台。他比两年前稍稍胖了一些，不过说话时还是那上海口音的普通话。
    实习生的工作，他说，主要是担任记录员，或者当领工员的助手。他们将被分配到第一中队，钻探中队，基地中队和机电中队。今天第一天，他们应该去看一看，四只桥墩从四号墩看起，一只只倒过来看，看到一号墩，正好把整个过程看一遍。
    赵工程师在分配实习生的工作交代清楚之后，赶快到二号墩去。刚才的会议上，专家不是警告了吗？
    实习生们坐上汽轮到四号墩去。
    四号墩是一个很大的钢结构，名叫钢围令，形如蜘蛛网，不过是立体的蜘蛛网，将来三十多根大管柱都要插到这中间去。它有四五层楼那么高。但它将要沉到江底下去。它对于未来的桥墩起着固定地位的作用。
    在四号墩上面的平台上，青年人又围住了石队长。三号和四号两个桥墩都由他负责。
    石队长开始和他们谈起来。不知怎的，话题很快地转到压气箱沉法了。石队长说他在三十多年前就当过沉箱工。青年们高兴极了，就问了他好些话。
    一百多年来，在深水河流中修筑桥梁，一般都用沉箱。用这方法修起了世上不少座有名的大桥。可是青年们没有想到这老工人对它这样反感。
    石队长给他们描写他怎样下沉箱工作：
    “人进头道门，‘喀！喀！’把它关上，这时就来风了，就是来了压缩空气了。风一来，把门顶紧，气压从一个增加到两个，三个，三个以上，人也就受不了啦。心头难过，耳朵痛，关节也隐隐作痛，有时眼鼻流血。等到这一间的气压增加到和里间的气压平衡，二道门就悠悠的开了。沉箱工进里间，从地板上的三道门下去，一把梯子一直通到深水下面。你下去几十公尺深，压气机供给你空气呼吸。到河床上，你就挖土推泥巴。在这样的沉箱里，不见太阳，灯火阴暗，不是人的世界。混身是泥，四十分钟就不能不上去。上去成了泥鬼。所以我们沉箱工有一句话：‘吃阳间饭，做阴间事！’你们知道沉箱里免不了要牺牲人。修起一座深水桥，不知要死多少人！”
    石队长把眼闭下，沉思着，好像说不需要讲得更多啦，悲惨的事情有的是。于是，他睁开了眼，震抖一下。忽然愁容消失了，他微笑起来。“现在呢？”他问。
    他举起手臂，画了一个环形。他们是在长江江心的高处，四号墩，一座升在江上面十多公尺的圆形平台上。大江景色，尽在他臂下。千百个风篷在江上张开。一列式、推顶式的汽轮和船舶在不很宽阔的航道中行驶经过。可以看见五号墩上的大型冲击式钻机，也可以看见三号墩上的震动打桩机。
    “现在，人舒服，而从前，是人受罪！现在，人不用到水底下去，不用到沉箱中去，不靠压缩空气生活啦！我们在水的上面，我们哪儿都能看见。这多好！从前下得深，现在站得高。从前越干人越衰弱，现在越干人越强壮！”
    石队长微笑，他的脸非常富于表情，他的动作语言很有韵律。他的短须使他非常可爱。
    “现在你们明白了吧，压气沉箱法要不得。我们管柱钻孔法多末好！我们工人就是拥护它，你们看，它给我们多末好的工作条件。人是最宝贵的，安全第一要紧。如今我们这墩子上要是走廊不好，栏杆不坚固，都要受苏联专家批评的呢……”
    这时，领工员冯森忽然跑过来：
    “石队长，有电话来调我们的吊船了，二号墩要！”
    “啊哟！那怎么办！”他说，有点着急的样子。
    一碰到工作，什么力量也不能叫他撂开不管。“以后再谈，”他对实习生说了，说完就下平台，从走廊经过，接电话去了。
    实习生们只好到三号墩去。那三号墩外表最简单。江水中升起一座钢的圆形围墙，名叫钢板桩，像一座水上的碉堡。在它旁边升起一座高高的了望台，实际是一个配电间。江水在这里哗哗地流过，成群的海鸥从汽轮旁掠过。
    当他们踏上三号墩旁边的木驳，他们看到了：
    “管柱！”
    远看和近看，完全是不同的。近看，才知道它这样粗大。
    啊，管柱，钢筋混凝土的大直径管柱，这新的方法中最主要的东西。它们像百年大树那末粗，横放着比他们的人还高。因为这些管柱的直径有一点五五公尺呢。
    他们经过管柱的两头时，都从中窥望一下，像看望远镜似的，看见了圆形的岸上、江上或墩上的风景。他们惊愕而又喜欢，爬进围墙，看到里面是一个宽广的场所。圆形的平台上，有二三十人在忙着，到处是巨蟒似的射水管。
    这一切都是想像不到的神奇经历。这时，三十五吨大吊船从外边的江上伸进一只钢铁大手臂，从他们的头顶降下了一根大管柱来。这九公尺高，十一吨重的大管柱将被笔直地沉到江底下，透过泥沙复盖层，直到下面的岩盘上。
    “开！”有人这样叫。几座马达营营地响了。年青的实习生们看见另一个笔直地挺立在平台上的大管柱突然下沉，缩短它自己，更缩短，更缩短。
    他们看到这管柱，它的射水管，它顶上的一座巨大机具，知道这就是所谓震动打桩机了。这管柱一直往下沉，快和平台相齐了，再下沉就要看不见了。
    “停！”人喊声，哨子声。马达不响了，吊船上却又转动起它的钢臂来，把刚才那根大管柱降下得更低，并使它接合到那已经大部分下沉了的那一根上去。
    这是美妙的协作，劳动的诗歌，一个苏联专家曾经赞美过这样的操作：“简直和演员们的表演一样熟练！”也怪不得所有的年轻的实习生们看得呆了。
    他们从三号墩又看到二号墩，和一号墩。看到这样伟大的社会主义建设，而且不久的将来他们就要带上藤帽，拿起纪录夹，开始参加到这个建设生活里去了，欣喜和羡慕的表情整天没有离开他们的脸。
