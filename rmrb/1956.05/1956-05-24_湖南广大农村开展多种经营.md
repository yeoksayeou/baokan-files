In the broad rural areas of Hunan Province, the Communist Party committees at all levels are promoting and leading agricultural production cooperatives to actively develop diversified economies. The Yupingshan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Liling County recently earned over 4,500 yuan in cash from operating transportation, oil pressing, and vegetable growing as sideline occupations. They used over 1,000 yuan of this money as agricultural production funds, 1,500 yuan as funds to expand sideline production, and the remaining 2,000+ yuan was paid in advance to cooperative members with difficult living conditions. The "May First" Agricultural Cooperative in Li County organized seventy-two female laborers and semi-laborers in mid-February to make bamboo hats and fans for sale to supply and marketing cooperatives, earning 1,800 yuan. With this income, the cooperative not only solved the living difficulties of its members but also bought forty-five pigs. The Meiqi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiangtan County had a sideline income of over 2,900 yuan in cash over three months, in addition to the necessary production expenses. The cooperative has now formulated an advance payment plan, stipulating that advances be paid to members once a month. During the first advance payment, 128 member households bought rice, sixty-seven households bought small farm tools, thirty-two households bought cooking oil and salt, and eight households even sought medical treatment. These members received a total of 1,500 yuan in cash.

Thanks to the development of diversified economies, these agricultural cooperatives have immediate cash income, which not only solves the living difficulties of some members but also further consolidates the agricultural cooperatives. (Our correspondent in Changsha)

    湖南广大农村开展多种经营
    湖南省各级中共党委正在推动并领导广大农业生产合作社积极开展多种经营。醴陵县玉屏山农业生产合作社最近从经营运输、榨油、种蔬菜等项副业中，已收入现金四千五百多元，他们把这笔钱用作农业生产的资金一千多元，用作扩大副业生产的资金一千五百元，其余两千多元都预支给生活困难的社员。澧县“五一”农业社在二月中旬就组织了七十二个妇女劳动力和半劳动力，做斗笠和扇子，卖给供销合作社，已收入一千八百元，社里靠这笔收入，既解决了社员的生活困难，又买了四十五头猪。湘潭县梅琪农业生产合作社三个多月的副业收入，除了用于必要的生产开支外，还余现款二千九百多元。这个社现在制定了一个预支方案，规定每月给社员预支一次。第一次实行预支时，有128户社员买了米，六十七户社员买了小农具，三十二户社员买了油盐，八户社员还诊了病。这些社员共支一千五百元现金。
    这些农业社由于开展多种经营，眼前就有现金收入，不仅解决了部分社员的生活困难，也进一步巩固了农业社。　（本报驻长沙记者）
