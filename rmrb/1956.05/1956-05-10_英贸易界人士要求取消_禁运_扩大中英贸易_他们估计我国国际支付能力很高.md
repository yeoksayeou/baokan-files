　　London dispatch: According to foreign news agencies, Britain is making new efforts in Washington to strive for the revision of the so-called "strategic materials embargo" against China. British business circles have noticed the continuous expansion of China's export potential. Agence France-Presse reported that British business circles believe that "China's means of foreign payment in pounds sterling are estimated to be at least 100 million pounds." They pointed out that "China's exports have been much larger than its imports in the past few years, resulting in an increase in its trade surplus every year." Therefore, they believe that the estimate of 100 million pounds in payment ability is "very likely to be underestimated," because this figure does not include China's trade surplus and invisible income from other regions where pounds sterling can be transferred. The news said: Well-informed sources in British business circles believe that if the trade embargo is lifted, Sino-British trade can really reach a higher level, that is, 60 million to 75 million pounds per year, and "China will not have any difficulties in terms of payment methods."

　　英贸易界人士要求取消“禁运”扩大中英贸易
    他们估计我国国际支付能力很高
    本报讯  伦敦消息：据外国通讯社报道，英国正在华盛顿进行新的努力，以争取修改对中国实行的所谓“战略物资禁运”。英国贸易界人士注意到中国出口潜力的不断扩大。法新社的消息说，英国贸易界人士认为“中国的英镑对外支付手段估计最小限度有一亿英镑”。他们指出，“中国在过去几年里的出口量比它的进口量大很多，结果是它的贸易顺差每年都有增加。”因此他们认为关于一亿英镑支付能力的估计还“很可能是过低了”，因为这个数字没有包括中国对可以用英镑转账的其他地区的贸易赢余和无形收入。消息说：英国贸易界消息灵通人士的意见是，如果取消贸易禁运，中英贸易真的能达到更高水平，即每年六千万到七千五百万英镑，“中国在支付手段方面也不会有什么困难”。
