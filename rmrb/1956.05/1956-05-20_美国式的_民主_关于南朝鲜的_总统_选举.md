American-Style "Democracy"
—On the "Presidential" Election in South Korea—
Jin Feng

On May 15, 1956, the South Korean government, established according to the "American democratic method," once again "elected" the 81-year-old "American citizen" Syngman Rhee as its "President."

This is the third "presidential election"!

In 1945, along with the arrival of the American occupation army's luggage in Korea, came the "American citizen" Syngman Rhee, who had spent half his life in Hawaii and Washington. In May 1948, in the "wilderness regions" (Syngman Rhee's words) of South Korea, Syngman Rhee transplanted the American "democratic method." In a congress protected by American bayonets, without the participation of voters, Syngman Rhee was elected as the first president.

Syngman Rhee dragged the South Korean people into war, into poverty, into the abyss of hunger, homelessness, and suffering. The boots of American invaders trample on the land of South Korea.

Four years passed. More and more members of Congress opposed Syngman Rhee. It seemed that "Congress would probably not re-elect Syngman Rhee, nor would it allow him to designate his successor." Syngman Rhee hurriedly proposed a "constitutional amendment" – the president should be directly elected by voters, without going through this unreliable Congress. The congressmen expressed their opposition. However, Syngman Rhee, trained in the American way of life, did not hesitate to arrest a large number of congressmen. Moreover, under the power of American bayonets, he forcibly dragged all the congressmen into the Congress and forced them to pass this "constitutional amendment." Under the protection of machine guns and police batons, in August 1952, he ascended to the "presidential" seat for the second time.

Another four years passed. The Korean War was stopped under the pressure of the people of the world, and the adventurers' steps were stopped near the 38th parallel. However, in South Korea under Syngman Rhee's rule south of the 38th parallel, 60% of the factories closed down, more than half of the farmers' grain was forcibly requisitioned and purchased, thousands of college students were dragged into the army, and hundreds of schools, newspapers, and magazines were closed. 1.5 million households had no housing, and 600,000 to 700,000 urban residents were starving... While the Korean people north of the 38th parallel were building factories on the ruins and rebuilding their homes in the rubble. The people of South Korea urgently demanded a change in the status quo, to build their motherland in the free air like their compatriots in the northern half. Syngman Rhee faced his third presidential election in such times.

The South Korean people could no longer tolerate the rule of this "American citizen." According to a United Press report, before the election, opposition figures in Seoul and Busan openly demanded that Syngman Rhee "retire from public life and move to Hawaii." Syngman Rhee stubbornly stated that he would "breathe my last breath" in Korea. And, of course, he had to run for a third term as president.

However, it seemed that the constitution was once again working against him, as it clearly stipulated that the president could only serve two consecutive terms. Syngman Rhee, with a full understanding of American-style democracy, once again unhesitatingly proposed a "constitutional amendment": the first president could serve more than one consecutive term. But he did not expect that even in the Congress, where his party members were in the majority, they did not respect this "democratic" method of his. Therefore, in a fit of anger, he had to hurriedly "pass" this bill by "rounding off" the number of votes. Then, as if as a prelude to the election campaign, his Ministry of Interior activated the machinery of the police in each province and county, instructing them to strictly and ruthlessly monitor and control the election activities of various opposition parties. As a result, the opposition parties' offices in various places were attacked, their staff were arrested and beaten, and even the registration documents of a vice-presidential candidate were snatched away in broad daylight. It is said that these are unavoidable in American-style presidential election activities. Until the very end, only ten days before the election day, Shin Ik-hee, the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party, who was on a campaign trip, suddenly died inexplicably. Another presidential candidate, Cho Bong-am of the Progressive Party, was so frightened that he also went into hiding. Thus, only Syngman Rhee and his Liberal Party remained.

The underground fire is running, and the people can no longer remain silent. On May 3rd, 150,000 people gathered on the banks of the Han River to hold a mass rally against Syngman Rhee. On May 5th, Seoul once again erupted in a large demonstration against Syngman Rhee. Tens of thousands of people poured towards the "Presidential Palace," shouting: "Down with the Syngman Rhee dictatorship!" "We can't continue to live like this, now is the time for change!" The police opened fire on the crowd, and according to several witnesses, "at least ten people could be seen lying on the ground." More than 700 people were arrested and imprisoned, including the elderly, housewives, and children. On the same day, mass demonstrations also took place in Busan.

This is the strongest protest of the South Korean people against the American-style President Syngman Rhee.

Things even developed to the point that, according to a United Press report, on the evening of May 13th, the people of Seoul scrambled to flee, plugging their ears so they wouldn't hear the campaign speeches, resulting in a tragedy. The story is this: three thousand people gathered in the plaza of a school, having been deceived into attending an "entertainment event" organized by Syngman Rhee's Liberal Party. In the middle of a music program, Liberal Party members began to give speeches demanding that voters cast their votes for Syngman Rhee. People scrambled to leave the school plaza, only to find the gates locked. The crowd began to surge and run, eventually collapsing a concrete wall, killing a twelve-year-old student and injuring four others. What a bitter satire of American-style "democracy"! This clearly shows that the South Korean people can no longer endure this trick of painting the nose white and dressing up as "democracy," and they are even less willing to be used as puppets to decorate this American-style "presidential election"!

The last episode of the election was: on the one hand, Syngman Rhee illegally printed a large number of ballots, and the military police and secret agents openly monitored the people's voting; on the other hand, the people cast more than 1.8 million invalid votes, the vast majority of which were so-called "ghost votes," cast for the deceased Democratic Party candidate Shin Ik-hee, to express their silent protest. Finally, amidst the cold hostility and indifference of the 20 million South Korean people, amidst the forest of bayonets and the clanging of iron chains, amidst the blood of demonstrators and the cries of imprisoned children, Syngman Rhee laboriously climbed onto the throne of the President of South Korea for the third time.

This is actually a copy of the standard American-style presidential election, only more blatant and cruder.

It is worth noting that in the process of vying for the presidential position, Syngman Rhee has also constantly issued belligerent clamors, threatening to withdraw the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and "declare the armistice invalid." This is naturally intended to stifle the hope of the Korean people for peaceful reunification of their motherland, so that the American military occupation of South Korea can be maintained indefinitely. It is precisely this point that completely suits the minds of the American rulers, enabling them to unreservedly use money and bayonets to support the election of the corrupt and incompetent Syngman Rhee.

    美国式的“民主”
    ——关于南朝鲜的“总统”选举——
    金凤
    1956年5月15日，按照“美国民主方式”建立起来的南朝鲜政府，又一次“选举”了八十一岁的“美国公民”李承晚作为大“总统”。
    这是第三次的“总统选举”！
    1945年，随着美国占领军行李车的抵达朝鲜，带来了在夏威夷和华盛顿度过半生的“美国公民”李承晚。1948年5月，在南朝鲜“荒野的地区”（李承晚语）上，李承晚移植了美国的“民主方式”。在没有选民参加的美国刺刀保护着的国会里，选出了第一任总统李承晚。
    李承晚把南朝鲜人民拖入战争，拖入贫困，拖入饥饿、流浪和痛苦的深渊。美国侵略者的皮靴踯躅在南朝鲜的土地上。
    四年过去了。国会里反对李承晚的议员一天多过一天。看起来“国会大概不会重选李承晚，也不会让他指定他的继承人。”李承晚慌忙提出了“宪法修正案”——总统由选民直接选举，不需要经过这个不可靠的国会。议员们表示反对。但是，美国生活方式训练出来的李承晚毫不犹预地逮捕了大批议员。而且，就在美国刺刀的威风下，他用武力把所有的议员抓到国会，强迫他们通过了这个“宪法修正案”。再在机枪和警棍的保护下，1952年8月他第二次登上“总统”的座位。
    又是四年过去了。朝鲜战争在全世界人民的压力下被制止了，冒险家的脚步被遏止在三八线附近。但是，在三八线以南李承晚统治下的南朝鲜，60％的工厂倒闭，农民一半以上的粮食被强征和强购，数以千计的大学生被拉去当兵，成百所学校、报纸、杂志被封闭。一百五十万户居民没有住所，六、七十万城市居民处在饥饿状态……而三八线以北的朝鲜人民，在废墟上盖起工厂，在瓦砾堆里重建家园。南朝鲜的人民迫切要求改变现状，像他们北半部的同胞一样在自由的空气中建设祖国。李承晚就在这样的时光面临第三次总统选举。
    南朝鲜人民再也无法忍受这位“美国公民”的统治。据合众社消息，选举以前，汉城和釜山的反对党的人士就公开要求李承晚“退出公共生活，搬到夏威夷去。”李承晚则死硬地表示他要在朝鲜“呼吸我的最后一口气”。而且，当然，他一定要竞选第三任总统。
    但是，看来，宪法又一次和他作对，那上面明明白白规定着：总统只能连任一次。对于美国式民主有充分理解的李承晚毫不犹预地再一次提出了“宪法修正案”：第一任总统可以连任一次以上。但是他料想不到在他的党徒占多数的国会里竟然没有尊重他这种“民主”的方式。于是，恼羞成怒的他不得不用“四舍五入”计算票数的办法来匆匆忙忙“通过”这项议案。然后，仿佛是作为竞选的前奏曲，他的内务部开动了各道、郡警察的机器，布置他们严厉地不容情地监视和控制各在野党派的竞选活动。于是，反对党在各地的办公处遭到了袭击，他们的工作人员被逮捕和殴打，甚至一名副总统候选人的候选人登记文件就在大白天被人抢走。据说，这些都是美国式的竞选总统的活动中不可避免的。一直到最后，离选举日只有十天，正在作竞选旅行的民主党的总统候选人申翼熙突然不明不白地死去。另一个总统候选人进步党的曹奉岩吓得也躲藏起来。于是，剩下的只有李承晚和他的自由党。
    地下的火在运行，人民不能再沉默下去。五月三日，十五万人聚集在汉江江畔，举行了反对李承晚的群众大会。五月五日，汉城又爆发了反对李承晚的大示威。几万群众涌向“总统府”，高喊：“打倒李承晚独裁政权。”“我们不能继续这样活下去，现在是改变的时候了！”警察向群众开枪冲过去，据几个目击者说：“至少可以看到有十个人躺在地上。”七百多人被抓起来关进监狱，包括老年人、家庭妇女和儿童。当天，釜山也发生了群众的示威。
    这是南朝鲜人民对于美式总统李承晚的最强烈的抗议。
    事情甚至发展到这一地步，据合众社报道，在五月十三日晚上，汉城人民争先恐后地逃走，掩耳不听竞选演说，以至造成惨剧。事情是这样的：三千群众聚集在一个学校的广场上，他们是被骗来参加李承晚的自由党所主办的“娱乐会”的。在一项音乐节目进行到中途的时候，自由党的党徒就发表演说要求选民们投李承晚的票。人们就争先恐后试图离开学校广场，但是却发现大门锁上了。人群开始拥挤奔跑，结果把一堵水泥墙也冲塌了，压死了一个十二岁的小学生，还有四个人受伤。这是多么辛辣的对于美式“民主”的讽刺！这清清楚楚表明南朝鲜人民再也无力忍受这种涂白了鼻子装扮“民主”的把戏，他们更不愿意被当做傀儡来点缀这种美国式的“总统选举”！
    选举的最后一个插曲是：一方面李承晚大量非法印刷选票，军警特务公开监视人民投票；而人民则投了一百八十多万张废票，其中绝大多数是所谓阴票，投给死去的民主党候选人申翼熙，来表示无声的抗议。终于，李承晚在二千万南朝鲜人民的冰冷的敌意与漠视之下，在如林的枪刺和鎯铛的铁链声中，在示威者的鲜血和监禁的儿童的哭泣声中，第三次费力地爬上南朝鲜总统的宝座。
    这其实是标准的美式选举总统的翻版，不过更露骨更粗野一点而已。
    值得注意的是李承晚在忙着争夺总统位置的过程中，还不断发出好战的叫嚣，威胁着要撤销中立国监察委员会和“宣布停战无效。”这自然是想扼杀朝鲜人民要求和平统一祖国的希望，使美军的占领南朝鲜可以无限期地维持下去。也就是这一点完全适合美国统治者的心意，使他们无保留地用金元和刺刀来支持腐败无能的李承晚的当选。
