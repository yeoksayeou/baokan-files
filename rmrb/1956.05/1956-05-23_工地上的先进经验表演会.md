Xinhua News Agency, Anshan Electric: Nine bricklayers, waterproofing workers, painters, and plasterers from the Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction General Company demonstrated twenty-three advanced construction methods to their colleagues throughout the company on the 19th at the construction site. Among them, the bricklayer representative from the Iron and Steel Construction Engineering Company demonstrated the "bricklaying method with simultaneous laying and jointing." After the full-scale promotion of this advanced operation method, labor efficiency can be increased by 40%. In the plastering project of concrete structures, plasterers successfully promoted the use of sprayers. Using this type of sprayer, 300 square meters can be sprayed per hour, while only 10 square meters can be sprayed per hour by manual operation. These advanced construction experiences are planned to be widely promoted.

    工地上的先进经验表演会
    据新华社鞍山电　鞍山冶金化学建筑总公司的九个瓦工、防水工、油工和粉刷工人，十九日在工地上向全公司的同行们表演了二十三种先进的施工方法。其中如炼钢建筑工程公司的瓦工代表，表演了“工人随砌随勾缝砌砖法”。这个先进操作方法全面推广以后，劳动效率能提高40％。在混凝土结构的粉刷工程上，粉刷工人成功地推广了喷浆器。使用这种喷浆器，每小时可喷刷三百平方公尺，而用人工操作每小时只能喷刷十平方公尺。这些先进施工经验准备普遍推广。
