Give Children More Puppet Shows
Wu Cun, Head of the China Puppet Art Theater

The moment the curtain rises on the small puppet theater stage, the theater becomes completely silent. Children fix their eyes on everything on the stage, and their hearts are quickly drawn into the world of puppets. Every time we perform for children and see their enthusiastic love, we feel that we should perform more for them and satisfy their needs as much as possible.

However, children are not satisfied with watching puppet shows performed by others; they also want to do it themselves. In Beijing, we assisted the Children's Palace in holding a performance during the Spring Festival, with more than forty school puppet groups participating, winning five best plays and more than ten excellent plays. We also assisted the Children's Palace in establishing puppet groups, providing guidance in scripts, production, performance, and stage. Children's puppet shows are also very active in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Fuzhou, which is very gratifying. We ourselves have not done enough in this regard. The repertoire only includes "Little Duck," "Happy Little Bear," "Little House on the Mountain," "Grandma Wolf," "Little Shepherd," and "Little Deer," which is currently in rehearsal. The number of seats in the theater is also limited (only two hundred to five hundred), and performances cannot be continuous. These shortcomings must be improved as soon as possible. However, in any case, it is not enough to rely solely on professional puppet troupes to undertake this work. We must also rely on children's palaces and school puppet groups to do the work better and meet the needs of the majority of children.

At present, schools or other amateur groups are experiencing difficulties in the following two issues, which require the cooperation of all parties to resolve.

One is the issue of scripts. We believe that in addition to using original or existing puppet show scripts, it is also possible to select and adapt from school language textbooks and children's reading materials. Although children's reading materials are not yet abundant, there are still many that can be adapted and used as creative reference materials. We can also adapt from children's stage plays and children's movies. Teachers and instructors can write their own scripts. The content of the scripts must cultivate the communist morality of the younger generation, be educational, concise, clear, and have clear-cut love and hate. When creating scripts, it is necessary to clarify the target audience of children. For example, the youngest children love animal images, slightly older children love stories, and older children love adventure and bravery. Children especially love interesting and funny plays. Puppet shows have many characteristics, which deter many writers. We believe that if writers can watch a few puppet shows with children, they will definitely dispel their concerns. How much we need writers and poets to give us great help in creation!

The other is the issue of production. The production of puppet shows must first rely on painters to create character image designs, just as it relies on writers, poets, and musicians to create scripts and music. The power of painters to help puppet shows is currently greater than that of writers, poets, and musicians. With puppet modeling design drawings, there is a basis for production. The production process is not as difficult as imagined. For the same script, the image specifications of the characters are not too strict. However, the images of all characters must start from a realistic basis, so that children can name them. Wolves and foxes, cats and tigers, should have significant differences. The puppet structure is also the most convenient with the "glove type" and is also the most suitable for performing satirical short plays.

The "June 1st" International Children's Day is coming soon. It is hoped that puppet shows in various places can be developed more widely and achieve greater results than in previous years, which is not only beneficial to the lives of children but also beneficial to the development of China's puppet art. We also hope that new puppet plays that combine traditional Chinese puppet shows with the advanced puppet art of the Soviet Union and other countries will appear soon. (Attached picture)

### 给儿童多演些木偶戏

    给儿童多演些木偶戏
    中国木偶艺术剧团团长　吴村
    只要木偶戏的小舞台的幕一拉开，剧场里立刻安静得没有一点声息。孩子们目不转睛地注视着台上的一切，他们的心很快就被吸引到木偶的世界里去了。当我们每次为儿童演出时，看到小观众们那样热烈的喜爱，总感到应该多多为他们演出、多多的满足他们的需要。
    但是，孩子们并不满足于看别人演出的一些木偶戏，他们还要自己动手干。在北京，我们曾经协助少年之家在春节举办会演，有着四十多个学校木偶小组参加，获得五个最佳剧目和十多个优秀剧目。我们也协助少年宫建立木偶小组，在剧本、制作、表演、舞台等方面，都进行了辅导。在上海、广州、武汉、福州各城市的儿童木偶戏也很活跃，这是非常可喜的。而我们自己在这方面还做得不够。演出剧目只有“小鸭”、“快乐的小熊”、“山上小房子”、“狼姥姥”、“小放牛”和正在排练的“小鹿”。剧场的座位又有限制（只有二百个到五百个），演出又不能做到连续不断，这些缺陷必须尽快地改进。但是，无论如何，单靠职业的木偶剧团来担负这项工作是不够的，还必须依靠少年宫和学校木偶组才能把工作做得更好，才能满足广大儿童们的需要。
    目前，学校或其它业余小组，大都在以下两个问题上感到困难，要依靠各方面来协同解决。
    一个是剧本问题。我们认为除了采用创作的或现有的木偶戏剧本之外，很可以从学校的语文课本和儿童读物选编，目前儿童读物虽然还不丰富，但是可供改编的和作为创作参考材料的还是不少的。我们也可以从儿童的舞台剧和儿童电影改编，老师和教导员都可以自己动笔。剧本内容必须是能培养年轻的一代的共产主义品德的，有教育意义，简练明确，爱憎分明的。在创作剧本的时候，要把儿童对象搞清楚。例如：最幼的儿童喜爱动物形象，稍大的儿童喜爱有点故事性的，再大的儿童喜爱冒险、勇敢的。儿童们特别喜爱有趣的逗笑的剧目。木偶戏是有许多特点的，许多作家也就为这些特点裹足不前，我们相信，如果作家们能和儿童们一起看过几场木偶戏，一定能打消顾虑的。我们是多么需要作家、诗人在创作方面给予我们大力帮助啊！
    另一个是制作问题。木偶戏的制作，首先要依靠画家来创作脚色形象图样，正像要依靠作家、诗人来创作剧本，音乐家来创作音乐。画家对木偶戏所帮助的力量，目前是比作家、诗人、音乐家更多。有了木偶造型设计图样，制作才有根据。制作的程序，并不如想像那么困难，同一个剧本，脚色的形象的规格并不太严。但所有的脚色的形象必须从真实的基础上出发，要使儿童们能叫得出名字，狼和狐狸，猫和老虎，应该有显著的区别。木偶构造，也以“手套式”的最灵便、也最宜演讽刺短剧的。
    今年“六一”国际儿童节转眼就到了，希望各地木偶戏能比往年开展得更广泛，更有成绩，这不仅是对儿童们的生活有利，也对我国的木偶艺术事业有利。我们更希望不久能有从民族传统的木偶戏结合苏联和其它国家先进的木偶艺术形成的新的木偶剧目出现。（附图片）
