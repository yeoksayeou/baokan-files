	Hanyu Pinyin – A Great Happy Event
	Xiao San
	I.
	Hanyu Pinyin – this will be another great happy event related to the lives of the vast majority of our people. Adopting the internationally used Latin alphabet as our language's phonetic tool – this is a very timely and correct decision. Can all people with good intentions and advanced workers, especially those in the fields of science, education, culture, and art, not be overjoyed by this major event, actively participate in discussions, and enthusiastically support its implementation?

	In the past few years, our people and government have done a lot of work on language reform: simplifying Chinese characters, promoting Mandarin, standardizing the Chinese language, all of which are very good. Not long ago, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council issued instructions on eliminating illiteracy, which is also a major event in our country. However, all of these efforts, especially the active promotion of Mandarin and the large-scale elimination of illiteracy, require a phonetic scheme to help with reading and pronunciation, in order to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Relying solely on oral instruction (organizing training classes, listening to the radio...) is not enough.

	The phonetic scheme is a powerful assistant and tool for teaching and promoting Mandarin. For example, learning the difference between S and Sh in the phonetic scheme, some people will no longer need to hold out four or ten fingers when saying "four" or "ten" to determine these two different numbers; some people in Guangdong and Guangxi saying "forty-four" will not be heard as "xi xi xi." If you pay attention to the difference between L and N, Fu and Hu in the scheme, people from Hunan will not say "Hunan" as "Fulan," but will say the correct Mandarin "Hunan"; and they will not say "naozi" (brain) as "laozi" (father), or pronounce both "na" (take) and "la" (pull) as "la."

	The phonetic scheme is a powerful assistant and tool for eliminating illiteracy. The difficulty of recognizing and reading Chinese characters is truly world-renowned! Eliminating illiteracy naturally starts with teaching people to recognize characters. Following the phonetic scheme to pronounce and read characters can achieve fast, numerous, good (accurate pronunciation), and economical (saving time and energy) results in teaching.

	With a phonetic scheme, we can translate the names of our various ethnic groups and the names of people and places from all over the world in a good (accurate pronunciation), economical (fewer strokes), and fast (less time spent) way. The four Chinese characters for "Urumqi" have more than thirty strokes; using six Latin letters Urumqi (original sound) solves the problem simply, quickly, and accurately. It takes twenty-six strokes to write the two Chinese characters for "Lhasa"; using four Latin letters effortlessly writes Lasa. (Recently, after reading the list of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region published in the newspaper, the fact that so many characters are needed to write many names made me feel the urgent need for Hanyu Pinyin even more!) The translation of foreign names and place names is even more so. Someone draws an "O," and we translate it as "奥" (ào), thirteen strokes, or "澳" (ào) or "噢" (ō), adding three more strokes to each – is this worthwhile? This is not to mention that the structure of these characters is complex and must be memorized. It is also difficult to accurately translate Chinese characters phonetically. "奥" is actually ao or au sound. There is no need to give more examples. If you had to fully translate a Soviet friend's name, patronymic, and surname, you would know the clumsiness of Chinese character translation. If you want to understand the original names and place names from Chinese translations, you can be sure that most of them are "impossible to investigate deeply": Is "拉" La or Ra? Is "加" Ga or Ka? – You can only guess!

	With a phonetic scheme, it is easy to remember the sounds of the many foreign words that have become indispensable in our daily lives: 咖啡 (coffee), 可可 (cocoa), 巧克力 (chocolate), 维他命 (vitamin), 曹达 (soda), 阿司匹灵 (aspirin), 凡士林 (vaseline), 摩托 (motor), 引擎 (engine), 拖拉机 (tractor), 康拜因 (combine), 逻辑 (logic), 幽默 (humor), 缪斯 (muse), 蒙太奇 (Montage), 习明纳尔 (Seminary), 歇斯底里 (hysteria), 苏维埃 (Soviet), 布尔塞维克 (Bolshevik), 孟塞维克 (Menshevik), 沙文 (chauvinism), 法西斯蒂 (fascist), 浪漫 (romanticism), 吉普 (jeep), 卡 (truck), 沙龙 (salon), 沙发 (sofa), 吨 (ton), 克 (gram)... and most of them can be returned to their original appearance: Penicillin does not need to be translated as "青霉素" (qingmeisu, penicillin), and we do not need to create another set of names for many scientific terms, which is both troublesome and inconsistent.

	With a phonetic scheme, we can also simply and easily record many sounds in our language. There are many reduplicated words in Chinese, especially words that express sounds, which are most suitable and easiest to spell phonetically. For example: 叮叮当当 (ding ding dang dang, tinkling), 冬冬 (dong dong, thump), 锵锵 (qiang qiang, clang), 橐橐 (tuo tuo, rustling), 嘎嘎 (ga ga, cackling), 轰轰隆隆 (hong hong long long, rumbling), 唧唧喳喳 (ji ji zha zha, chirping), 叽哩咕噜 (ji li gu lu, gibberish)... Also, common in lyrics: 咿 (yi), 呀 (ya), 唔 (wu), 嘿 (hei), 嗨 (hai), 哟 (yo), 呃 (e)... expressing exclamation: 啊 (a), 噢 (o), 咦 (yi), 唉 (ai), 哎 (ai), 咳 (hai), 哦 (o)... Traditionally, a Chinese character with a similar sound is grabbed, regardless of the number of strokes and whether it has meaning, and a "口" (mouth) radical is added to it, which is considered completing the task. If these words are all spelled phonetically, how much energy and time can authors and readers save! At the same time, can't many sounds that cannot be written in Chinese characters be written out?

	From this, we can see that the phonetic scheme has many and great uses at present: in addition to teaching literacy and teaching Mandarin, it can also be used for transliteration, phonetic transcription, phonetic annotation... For our construction, for marching towards science and culture, how can we not welcome this key that can open their doors – Hanyu Pinyin?

	II.
	The further development of the phonetic scheme, what we hope for is a phonetic script. Although this is not the main goal at present, we may as well look at its long-term prospects. Let's start with cultural, educational, and publishing work.

	All those who work with words often feel distressed because this writing tool – square Chinese characters – is difficult to write; some things cannot be written in Chinese characters; no matter how colloquial the written works are, 80% of the people still cannot recognize or understand them.

	Speaking of the difficulty of writing and recognizing Chinese characters, please allow me to give a random example: it is very easy for us to sneeze, but it is extremely difficult to write these two characters! Farmers may find it easier to master a double-wheeled double plow than to write these five characters. Workers sweating over a boiler will probably sweat just as much writing those three characters. Speaking of intellectuals, even advanced "bookworms" who specialize in books for a lifetime, even "erudite scholars" who have "studied classics until their hair turns white," how many dare to call themselves "knowledgeable"! (Isn't it said that the "Book of Documents" has been studied for two thousand years and still not understood?) Everyone admits the merits of Chinese characters; but the difficulty of Chinese characters is too terrifying! Simplifying Chinese characters is truly "opening a door of convenience." However, many Chinese characters do not have simplified forms. If Chinese characters are phoneticized, after experimentation and practice, and then further used as a phonetic script, wouldn't that be even more "meritorious" for authors and readers?

	Another major annoyance for literary workers and all word workers is that: no matter how colloquial the written articles are, they are all "big black blobs, small characters unrecognizable" (Hunan dialect) to the illiterate. Is it said to "recognize characters by their radicals"? Any radical is not easy to recognize. Moreover, recognizing "工" (work) and "水" (water) does not mean you can read "江" (river); recognizing "可" (can) and "水" (water) does not mean you can read "河" (river). This problem is especially serious when creating children's literature and compiling elementary school textbooks. It's easy for us to teach children to learn "one, two, three," but when it comes to "four," we have to frown. You can't just use a few characters like "人, 手, 足, 刀, 尺..." (person, hand, foot, knife, ruler...) to compose a story. Moreover, we say "jiao" (foot) in spoken language, not "zu" (foot). Therefore, I often say that Chinese children are really pitiful! After two or three years of schooling, they still cannot independently read a short story in one breath. But in countries that use phonetic scripts, five or six-year-old children can read story poems and prose on their own. They only need to learn the twenty-odd Latin letters or thirty-two Russian letters and the basics of simple phonetics in games to be able to read. By elementary school, they can read and recite the works of Pushkin and Tolstoy, Gorky and Mayakovsky, Goethe and Schiller, Mickiewicz and Petőfi… It is precisely the difficulty of writing that determines the fate of children, determines that Soviet children only need to study for ten years to enter university, but Chinese children need to study for twelve years.

	After studying for twelve years, Chinese students generally have a lower level of knowledge in literature and culture than Soviet ten-year system graduates. How can we blame our young friends? "Magic Words" written by Oseyeva, published by the Soviet Children's Literature Publishing House, was originally reading material for preschool children, but it became the "Words of the White-Bearded Old Man" in the 24th lesson of the fourth volume of our elementary school Chinese textbook, a difference of at least three years. Reading material for the second grade in Soviet schools can only be read by first-year junior high school students in China. The literature section of "National Language," an extracurricular reading material for third-grade students in Soviet elementary schools, contains works by classical and modern writers. In the seventh grade, they begin to formally study the history of literature from before Pushkin to the present. Outside of class, they can also read many, many classical and modern, domestic and foreign works. But what about our Chinese elementary and middle school students? Pitiful! They read very, very few national literary classics. They also know very little about the lives and works of ancient and modern writers. As for classics, history, philosophy, and collections of essays, "Li Sao," and "Nine Songs"... they cannot touch them at all.

	Is it said that the intelligence of Chinese youth is lower than others? That is a baseless statement. We can be proud of our youth's learning spirit and talent. But our youth's cultural and artistic cultivation is not very high now. Our entire nation is not yet a highly cultured nation. In addition to the many political and economic reasons left over from the past, there is a cultural reason, that is, the difficulty of writing, that is, the irreconcilable contradiction between Chinese characters and spoken language. In this era of vigorously developing socialist economic construction, we must overcome this difficulty and contradiction, eliminate this obstacle – reform our writing, move towards the common world phonetic direction, and use the Latin alphabet to serve us (just like using trains and airplanes to replace camels and donkeys as transportation tools – we are in the atomic age today), so as to usher in and meet the high tide of cultural construction, and to catch up with the world's advanced scientific level. For the sake of the great future of the motherland, for the sake of the vast masses of the people, for the sake of children, and for the sake of future generations, shouldn't we do this?

	Hanyu Pinyin – "It was not until the proposal for Latinization appeared that the crucial point for solving the problem was grasped" (Lu Xun). Pinyin will not exclude, limit, or erode internationally used scientific and technical terms or hinder their dissemination and learning. Pinyin can make our writing continuously progress and become richer. With phonetic writing, all advanced, progressive, and modern cultures in the world can be easily "brought in." Phonetic writing will not exclude the spoken language of the masses. On the contrary, it can make writing – literature – move more smoothly in the direction of colloquialism. "Locomotive" will not be said as "jiche" again. "At the time of..." will not be written as "At... time." Writers of poems and novels will not be afraid that people will not even understand the poems during recitation. Those who write drama and film scripts will be able to write their dialogues more according to the characters' personalities. Those who write children's literature will not be afraid that children will not understand stories that are originally very simple, and they can write children's own lovely language. In a word: with phonetic writing, the readers of all newspapers, periodicals, books, and literary and artistic works will not be just hundreds of thousands or millions, but tens of millions or hundreds of millions!

	From creating a phonetic scheme to phonetic writing, there are naturally many and great difficulties, and much scientific research and preparatory work needs to be done. Writers who use the very advantageous tool – phonetic writing – must use brand-new viewpoints and brand-new techniques to deal with their language – this is certainly an extremely arduous task. But thinking that literary writers' works have always had a great influence and role on the formation and development of language and writing, how can literary and art workers, the masters of language art, not rise up with great determination and great enthusiasm to make special efforts for this glorious and great cause?

	The already published "Hanyu Pinyin Scheme" (draft) naturally still has negotiable points, especially: can the number of letters be more economical and frugal; is it better to create a few new letters, or to consistently adopt the principle of internationally used letters... which method is more suitable for the needs of the broad masses and more scientific – these can be gradually modified through discussion and experimentation. The important thing is that a phonetic scheme has been created, and from the perspective of broad public opinion, it will never regress to pictographs, pictophonetic characters... and fanqie and other primitive states, nor will it take other detours. Lenin said such a sentence: "Latinization – the cultural revolution of the East." Let us cheer for using the Latin alphabet as a tool for Hanyu Pinyin.

    汉语拼音——一大喜事
    萧三
    一
    汉语拼音——这将是关系我国广大人民生活的又一件大喜事。采用世界通用的拉丁字母作为我们语言的拼音工具，——这是一项很合时宜的、正确的决定。一切有心人士和先进工作者，特别是科学、教育、文化、艺术界人士，能不为这件大事而欢欣鼓舞，积极参加讨论和热烈赞助推行么？
    几年以来，我们人民和政府对于文字改革，已经做了许多工作：简化汉字啦，推广普通话啦，汉语规范化啦，这都很好。前不久中共中央和国务院又发出扫除文盲的指示，这也是我国一件大事。但是所有这些工作，特别是积极推广普通话和大规模扫除文盲，都需要有一个拼音方案来帮助念字和发音，才能够收到事半功倍的效果。单靠口授（办训练班、听广播……）是不够的。
    拼音方案是教学和推广普通话的有力助手和工具。举例说，学会拼音方案里S和Sh的区别，有些人说“四”或“十”的时候就不需要伸出四个或十个手指头来确定这两个不同的数字了；广东、广西的某些人说“四十四”就不会被听为“西西西”了。假如注意方案里L和N、Fu和Hu的区别，湖南人就不会把“湖南”说成“扶栏”（Fulan），而会说出正确的普通话“Hunan”来了；也不会把“脑子”说成“老子”，或者“拿”和“拉”都说成“拉”了。
    拼音方案是扫除文盲的有力助手和工具。汉字的难认难读，真是全世界闻名！扫除文盲，首先自然是教人认字。按照拼音方案去发音念字，就能在教学方面做到又快、又多、又好（音正确）、又省（省时间省精力）。
    有了拼音方案就能够又好（音正确）又省（笔画少）又快（花的时间少）地把我国各兄弟民族以及全世界各国的人名地名音译出来。乌鲁木齐四个汉字有三十多笔画，用Urumci（原字音）六个拉丁字母就简单迅速而且正确地解决问题了。要二十六笔才能写出拉萨两个汉字，用四个拉丁字母就轻松地写出Lasa来了。（最近看了报纸上发表的西藏自治区筹备委员会的名单，许多名字要用那么多的汉字来写，更加感到汉语拼音的迫切需要！）音译外国人名地名更是这样。人家画一个“O”，我们音译为“奥”，十三笔，或“澳”或“噢”，再各加三笔，难道这合算么？这里还不说这些汉字的结构复杂非死记不成。汉字译音也难得正确呀。“奥”其实是ao或au音。例子不必多举。你假如要全部翻译一个苏联朋友的名、父名、姓，你就会知道汉字译音的笨了。你假如要从汉译反过来去了解原来的人名地名，保险大部是“无法深究”的：“拉”是La还是Ra呢？“加”是Ga还是Ka呢？——只能瞎猜！
    有了拼音方案就可以容易记下那些已经成为我们日常生活里不能缺少的许许多多外来语的音来：咖啡、可可、巧克力、维他命、曹达、阿司匹灵、凡士林、摩托（马达）、引擎、拖拉机、康拜因、逻辑、幽默、缪斯、蒙太奇（Montage）、习明纳尔（Seminary）、歇斯底里、苏维埃、布尔塞维克、孟塞维克、沙文（主义）、法西斯蒂、浪漫（主义）、吉普、卡（车）、沙龙、沙发、吨、克……并且可以大部归还它们的本来面目：Penieilin就不必译成“青霉素”了，许多科学上的名词我们就不必自己另外搞一套了，那既费事，又不通。
    有了拼音方案还可以简单容易地记下我们语言里面许多的音来。汉语里面叠声的词非常的多，特别是表示声响的字眼，是最该也最容易拼音的了。例如：叮叮当当、冬冬、锵锵、橐橐、嘎嘎、轰轰隆隆、唧唧喳喳、叽哩咕噜……又如歌词里常见的：咿、呀、唔、嘿、嗨、哟、呃……表示感叹的：啊、噢、咦、唉、哎、咳、哦……从来都是抓一个音相近的汉字来，不管笔画多少和有无意义，只加它一个“口”旁，就算完成任务。假如这些字都拼音，那么，作者和读者都能节省多少精力和时间！同时，还有许多用汉字写不出来的声音，不都可以写出来了么？
    由此可见，拼音方案在目前就有很多和很大的用处：除了教学识字、教学普通话以外，还可以用来译音、记音、注音……为了我们的建设，为了向科学和文化进军，我们怎能不欢迎这个能够打开它们的大门的钥匙——汉语拼音呢？
    二
    拼音方案的进一步发展，我们希望的就是拼音文字。这虽然不是目前的主要目的，但也不妨看看它的远景。请从文化、教育、出版工作说起。
    大凡作文字工作的人经常觉得苦恼的，就是这个文字工具——方块汉字难写；有一些话用汉字写不出来；写出来的作品，无论怎么通俗，80％的人民群众还是认不得，读不懂。
    说汉字难写难认，请允许我随便举个例子：我们打个喷嚏那很容易，但是要写出这两个字来就难的不行！农民掌握双轮双铧犁，也许比写这五个字要容易些。工人烧锅炉和写这三个字，大概都要出一身大汗的。说到知识分子，就连高级的，一辈子专门攻书的“读书人”，“直到”“皓首穷经”的“鸿儒”，有几个敢于自称“通了”的！（不是说，一部“尚书”搞了二千年还没有搞通么？）汉字有功，谁都承认；但汉字之难也就太可怕了！简化汉字真是“大开方便之门”。但是不少的汉字是没有简体的。假如汉字由注音，经过试验和实践，再进一步作为拼音文字，那对作者和读者不更是“功德无量”了么？
    文学工作者和一切文字工作者还有一个最大的苦恼，就是：写出来的文章，无论怎样通俗，在文盲看起来都是“大字墨墨黑，小字不认得”（湖南俗语）。说“认字认一边”么？任何一边都不容易认啊。而且认了“工”和“水”也读不成“江”；认了“可”和“水”读不成“河”啊。这个问题，在创作儿童文学读物和编小学教科书的时候，特别感觉得严重。我们教小孩子学“一、二、三”都还容易，但到了“四”就得皱眉头。你不能只用“人、手、足、刀、尺……”几个字来编个故事啊。而且口头话说“脚”不说“足”啊。因此我常说，中国的孩子实在可怜！上学二三年还不能独自一口气读完一篇短故事。但在用拼音文字的国家里，五六岁的孩子就能自己读故事诗和散文了。他们只要在游戏里学会二十几个拉丁字母或三十二个俄文字母和初步的简单拼音法，就可以念书了。到了小学他们就能读和背诵普式庚和托尔斯泰，高尔基和马雅可夫斯基，歌德和席勒，密茨凯维支和裴多菲……的作品了。就正是文字的难易，决定儿童的命运，决定苏联儿童只要学十年就可入大学，但我国儿童要学十二年。
    学习了十二年之后，中国学生在文学、文化方面一般的知识水平比起苏联十年制毕业的学生来要低些。这怎么能怪我们的青少年朋友呢？苏联儿童文学出版社出的奥谢也夫写的“魔术字”，本是学龄前的儿童读物，却成了我们的初级小学语文课本第四册第二十四课的“白胡子老头儿的话”，相差至少三年。苏联学校二年级的读物，中国初中一年级的学生才能读。苏联小学三年级学生的课外读物“国语”里文学之部就有古典和现代作家的作品。七年级就开始正式学习从普式庚以前到现代的文学史。课外，他们还能读许多许多古典的和现代的、本国的和外国的作品。可是我们中国的小学中学生呢？可怜的很！本国文学经典名著读的很少很少。古今文学家的生平、创作也知道的很少。至于经史子集、离骚九歌……根本不能触及。
    说中国青少年的智力低于别人么？那是毫无根据的说法。我们青少年的学习精神和才能是很可以自豪的。但是我们青少年的文化文艺修养现在还不很高。我们整个民族还不是一个具有高度文化的民族。这除了过去遗留下来的政治的经济的许多原因而外，有一个文化的本身的原因，那就是文字的艰难，那就是汉字和口头语有无法调和的矛盾。在这社会主义经济建设蓬蓬勃勃地发展的时代，我们必定要克服这个艰难和矛盾，扫除这个障碍——改革我们的文字，走世界共同的拼音方向，把拉丁字母拿来为我们服务（如同拿火车、飞机来代替骆驼、毛驴作交通工具一样——我们今天是处在原子时代啊），这样来掀起和迎接文化建设的高潮，来赶上世界先进科学水平。为伟大祖国的前途着想，为广大人民群众着想，为孩子着想，为子孙后代着想，我们不应该这样做么？
    汉语拼音——“待到拉丁化的提议出现，这才抓住了解决问题的紧要关键”（鲁迅）。拼音不致于排斥、限制、侵蚀国际通用的科学技术名词或妨碍它们的传播和学习。拼音可以使得我们的文字不断地进步和丰富起来，世界一切先进的进步的现代文化，有了拼音文字就很容易“拿来”。拼音文字不致于排斥人民大众的口头语，相反，它可以使得文字——文学更加顺利地往通俗的方向走。“火车头”不会又说成“机车”。“在……的时候”不会写成“在……时”。写诗的、写小说的不怕朗诵的时候人们甚至听不懂。写戏剧、电影剧本的更加能够按照角色的性格写出他们的对白来。写儿童文学的不会害怕孩子们看不懂本来是很简单的故事，而且可以写出儿童自己的可爱的语言来。一句话：有了拼音文字，一切报纸、刊物、书籍，和文学艺术作品的读者将会不只是几十万或几百万，而会是几千万、几万万！
    从制出拼音方案到拼音文字，自然还有很多很大的困难，还要做许多科学研究和准备工作。文字工作者用十分有利的工具——拼音文字来写作就不能不用崭新的观点，崭新的手法，来处理自己的语言——这当然是一项极其艰巨的任务。但是一想到文学作家的作品对于语言文字的形成和发展，从来就有极大的影响和作用，文艺工作者，语言艺术的大师们，能够不抱着极大的决心和极大的热情，起来为这个光荣伟大的事业而特别努力么？
    已经发表的“汉语拼音方案”（草案），自然还有可商量的地方，特别是：字母的数目可不可以经济、节约一些；是新造几个字母好，还是贯穿采用世界通用字母的原则好……哪一个办法比较更适合于广大群众的需要和更科学一些——这都是可以经过讨论和试验来逐渐修改的。重要的是，一个拼音方案制出来了，从广大舆论看来，以后再不会倒退到象形、形声……以及反切等等原始状态了，也不会再走别的弯路了。列宁说过这样一句话：“拉丁化——东方的文化革命。”让我们为用拉丁字母作为汉语拼音的工具而欢呼吧。
