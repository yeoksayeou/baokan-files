    Guangzhou to Build Ramie Textile Factory
    Construction began on May 7th in the eastern suburbs of Guangzhou on a ramie textile factory with 20,000 spindles. This factory is called the Joint State-Private Guangzhou Ramie Textile Factory and is a joint venture between overseas Chinese and the state.
    According to the design, it will be a combined factory with complete equipment for ramie degumming, spinning, weaving, dyeing, and finishing. The entire construction project is designed and organized for construction by Chinese engineers and technicians themselves.
    After the ramie textile factory is completed, it will be able to produce more than 20.22 million meters of various styles and printed ramie fabrics annually.
    Ramie yarn has stronger tensile strength than cotton yarn. The woven fabric is strong and has a silky luster. Clothes made from it allow perspiration to evaporate in the summer, making them light, comfortable, and beautiful. It has always been loved by the broad masses of people and is very popular in the international market. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    广州兴建苎麻纺织厂
    一座有二万纺锭的苎麻纺织厂，七日在广州市东郊动工兴建。这个厂叫公私合营广州苎麻纺织厂，是由华侨和国家合资经营的。
    按照设计，它是具有苎麻脱胶、纺纱、织布和染整的全套设备的联合工厂。整个建设工程都是由中国工程技术人员自己设计和组织施工的。
    这个苎麻纺织厂建成以后，每年能生产各种款式和印花的苎麻布2，022万多公尺。
    苎麻纱的拉力比棉纱强，织成布结实而有丝的光泽，作成衣服在夏天穿着能发散汗水，轻快、舒适又美观。它一向受到广大人民的喜爱，并且在国际市场上很受欢迎。（据新华社讯）
