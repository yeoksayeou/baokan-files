    Polish Publishing Festival

    Since 1946, Poland has held an annual "Education, Books and Publishing Festival." During the approximately two-week festival, the cultural life of the Polish people is particularly active. A lively book market is held in Warsaw, and countless reading competitions and seminars are held in various cities and villages. Readers exchange their reading experiences and meet with many well-known writers. These festivals often become meaningful days for the Polish people to review their achievements in education and publishing and to disseminate cultural knowledge.

    This year's "Education, Books and Publishing Festival" will be held from May 19th to June 3rd for two weeks. In the past year, Poland has published a total of more than 8,400 publications, with a total of more than 105 million copies printed. That is to say, the national average is about four copies per person, while before the war, the average was one book for every two people. Classical literary works accounted for 36.3% of the total number of books published in the past year, of which nearly 16.7 million copies were for adults and more than 17.8 million copies were for young people. A feature of book publishing is the continuous increase in the number of science and technology books printed. This reflects the growth of the people's scientific and technological knowledge level and the improvement of workers' technical proficiency.

    Books have become indispensable companions in the daily life of the Polish people. There are now 36,000 libraries in Poland. These libraries contain thousands of books of various contents, and they strive to deliver the most needed and most interesting books to the readers.

    Speaking of Poland's publishing industry, we cannot fail to mention the distribution of newspapers and periodicals. At present, there are more than 400 kinds of periodicals and more than 40 kinds of daily newspapers in Poland, with an annual circulation of 1.8 billion copies. From 1949 to 1955, the total circulation of newspapers and periodicals in Poland reached 10 billion copies. This figure shows the popularization of education and that the cultural revolution has penetrated every corner of Poland.

    波兰的出版节
    从1946年以来，波兰每年一度举行“教育、书籍和出版节”。在为时大约两周的节日里，波兰人民的文化生活特别活跃。在华沙举行热闹的书市，在各个城市和乡村举行无数次的读书比赛会和座谈会，读者交换他们读书的心得，并和许多知名的作家会见。这些节日，往往成为波兰人民检阅他们在教育与出版事业方面所获得的成就和传播文化知识的富有意义的日子。
    今年的“教育、书籍和出版节”在五月十九日到六月三日的两周内举行。在过去的一年内，波兰总共出版了八千四百多种出版物，共印行一亿零五百多万册。也就是说，全国平均每人可以分得四册左右，而在战前，平均每两个人才能分到一本书。古典文学作品在这一年内的印数占书籍出版总数的36.3％，其中供成年人阅读的近一千六百七十万册，供青少年阅读的共一千七百八十多万册。书籍出版的一个特点是科学技术读物印数的不断增加。这反映了人民群众科学技术知识水平的成长和工人技术熟练程度的提高。
    书籍已经成为波兰人民日常生活中不可缺少的伴侣了，现在波兰全国共有三万六千个图书馆。这些图书馆藏有成千成万册各种内容的书籍，它们力求把最需要和最有趣的书本送到读者的手里。
    说到波兰的出版事业，就不能不提及报刊的发行。现在波兰全国有定期刊物四百多种，日报四十多种，它们每年的发行量达到一十八亿份。从1949年到1955年，波兰全国的报刊发行总量达到一百亿份。这个数字说明教育的普及，说明文化革命已经深入到波兰全国的每一个角落里了。
