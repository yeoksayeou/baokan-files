Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 21st: Chongqing Steel Company recently summarized the experience of the advanced producer movement in the first quarter, affirmed the advanced levels achieved, and, focusing on weak links, used the advanced levels already attained by some work sections and production teams as goals to strive for, promoting all workshops and types of work to universally reach advanced levels.
    The steelmaking workshop proposed to strive to increase the proportion of rapid steelmaking to 50% in the second quarter, catching up with the most advanced Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant in the country in the first quarter. In the first quarter, the rapid steelmaking proportion of some production teams in this workshop had already reached 58%. Now, in addition to summarizing their own workshop's operating experience, they have also established a rapid steelmaking promotion group and an advanced experience school to help workers improve their rapid steelmaking technical level.
    The operating time of the highest production team in the rolling mill workshop this year reached 60% to 89%, but the average operating rate of each workshop was only 30% to 70%. They decided to promote the recently successfully tested and already achieved significant results of rapid roll changing, rapid steel rolling, and other advanced experiences, and strive to increase the operating time to 74% to 90% in the second quarter.
    After the iron smelting workshop began to promote major advanced experiences such as high-pressure blasting and self-fluxing sintered ore in the first quarter of this year, the effective volume occupied per ton of iron smelted in March has dropped to below 0.9 cubic meters. Now they have decided to continue to promote these major advanced experiences so as to consolidate the blast furnace utilization coefficient below 0.91 cubic meters.
    Now, the workshops of this company are focusing on key production issues and are actively mobilizing workers to find solutions.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 21st: Eighteen outstanding textile workers attending the National Textile Industry Advanced Producer Representative Conference have been imparting operating experience in Shanghai since yesterday.
    They are imparting a total of seventeen operating experiences, including the operating experiences of major types of work in cotton textile factories such as carding, roving, spinning, doffing, cone winding, heddle threading, and weaving, many of which are related to improving product quality.
    Seven of the eighteen performers are Shanghai textile workers. Liu Guniang, Huang Baomei, Yang Fuzhen, and other Shanghai textile workers familiar to many have brought back new experiences to participate in the performance this time.
    This experience sharing is being conducted at the National Textile Industry Advanced Experience Study Class organized by the Ministry of Textile Industry, the National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China, and other relevant departments. In the future, advanced producers will also go to Tianjin, Qingdao, Zhengzhou, Wuhan and other places to impart experience.

    重庆钢铁公司推动职工向先进目标前进
    优秀的纺织工人在上海传授先进操作经验
    据新华社重庆21日电　重庆钢铁公司最近总结了第一季度的先进生产者运动的经验，肯定了先进的水平，针对薄弱环节，以部分工段和生产班组已经达到的先进水平作为奋斗目标，推动各个车间和工种普遍达到先进水平。
    炼钢车间提出，争取在第二季度内使快速炼钢比例达到50％，赶上第一季度全国最先进的上海第三钢厂。在第一季度中，这个车间有的生产班的快速炼钢比例，已经达到了58％。现在他们除了总结本车间的操作经验以外，还成立了快速炼钢推广小组和先进经验学校，帮助工人提高快速炼钢的技术水平。
    轧钢车间今年最高生产班的作业时间，达到了60％到89％，但是各车间的平均作业率还只有30％到70％。他们决定推广最近试验成功并且已经取得显著效果的快速换辊、快速轧钢等先进经验，争取在第二季度将作业时间提高到74％到90％。
    炼铁车间今年第一季度开始推广高压鼓风、自熔性烧结矿等重大先进经验以后，三月份每炼一吨铁所占用的有效容积已经下降到零点九立方公尺以下。现在他们决定继续推广这些重大的先进经验，以便使高炉利用系数巩固在零点九一立方公尺以下。
    现在这个公司的各车间，正在针对生产关键提出课题，并且积极发动职工设法解决。
    据新华社上海21日电　出席全国纺织工业先进生产者代表会议的十八个优秀纺织工人，从昨天起在上海传授操作经验。
    他们传授的操作经验共有十七项，包括梳棉、粗纱、细纱、落纱、筒子、穿扣和织布等棉纺织厂主要工种的操作经验，其中有许多是有关提高产品质量的。
    十八个表演者中有七个是上海纺织工人。上海纺织工人熟悉的刘姑娘、黄宝妹、杨富珍等这次都带回新的经验参加表演。
    这次传授经验，是在纺织工业部、中国纺织工会全国委员会等有关部门举办的全国纺织工业先进经验学习班进行的。以后先进生产者还要到天津、青岛、郑州、武汉等地传授经验。
