    Report to Comrades
    Qing Pi
    I am a Tibetan worker, currently working as a road worker at the Kangding National Highway Administration, doing road repair work near Ganzi. This is my second time coming to Beijing. In the past year, I've seen so many new factories and tall buildings built on the plains. The more I look at them, the more I love them, and I'm so happy that I can't even sleep at night.

    When I was a child, life was very hard. I helped people herd horses and sheep, slaughtered cattle, and watched houses. I did all sorts of things. When I first joined the highway work, I didn't understand anything clearly. I just wanted to get a bowl of rice and a piece of clothing. Who knew that when I arrived at the Seventy Road Team at the foot of Que'er Mountain, the comrades would teach me skills and tell me about revolutionary principles? The team leader would go to Ganzi to buy vegetables, and every time he would bring back a lot of butter and tsampa for me. Gradually, I understood: we are building a "road to liberation," and I must put all my strength into it! My home is not far from Ganzi, but I never ask for leave because I don't want to delay work. I also humbly learn from the advanced experiences of Han workers and encourage Tibetan workers to learn together. Therefore, I was selected as a national highway labor model last year.

    Last June, after I finished attending the labor model representative conference, I returned to the Seventy Road Team. The comrades all gathered around me, wanting me to talk about what I saw and learned in Beijing. I told them about the advanced experiences I heard in Beijing for two nights, and everyone was very happy and expressed their desire to study hard.

    A few days later, I was transferred to the Sixty-Eighth Road Team, and I told the Sixty-Eighth Road Team many advanced experiences. For example, originally when we carried soil, we had to put down the carrying pole, wait until the soil basket was full, attach the hooks of the carrying pole, and then carry it away. Now, we install sliding rings between the carrying pole and the soil basket. The carrying pole never leaves the soil basket, nor does it leave the shoulders. Carrying the soil is much faster than before. Some people think it's troublesome to install sliding rings. Every day after work, I help them install them. We also promoted the "vertical sieve soil method," breaking the quota by 80%.

    Paving requires a lot of coarse sand. The original plan was to take the sand from a place 300 meters away from the construction site. I remembered the principles of "local materials" and "shortening the transportation distance" that were often discussed at the conference, so I picked up a shovel and looked for sand near the construction site. After shoveling in a few places, I found a muddy sand area only a few tens of meters away from the construction site.

    Last December, a stream of water came down from the mountain and flowed into the culvert we were building. The water froze into hard ice, so we chipped the ice. We were shivering from the cold, but we refused to stop and broke through the ice cave several days ahead of schedule.

    In 1955, our Sixty-Eighth Road Team overfulfilled the plan by 18.6% and was rated as a model team by the Kangding National Highway Administration. This time, I was selected as a representative to attend the National Advanced Producers Representative Conference and came to Beijing for a meeting again. I will learn even more humbly and bring back the advanced experiences to promote. I will work even harder and be a more advanced producer.

    向同志们汇报
    青批
    我是一个藏族工人，现在在康定国道管理局当道工，在甘孜附近做修公路的工作。我到北京来，已经是第二次了。在去年我所看到的平地上，又新建了那么多工厂和又高又大的楼房，我越看越爱看，高兴得晚上连觉都睡不着。
    我小时候，生活很苦，帮人牧马放羊，杀牛看房子，啥都做过。刚参加公路工作，我对啥也认识不清，我只想混碗饭吃，混件衣穿就行了。谁知一来到雀儿山脚的七十道班，同志们就教我学技术，给我讲革命道理。班长到甘孜买菜，每次还要给我带回许多酥油和糌粑。慢慢我就懂得了：我们修的是“翻身路”，我要把我全身的力气都用进去！我的家离甘孜不远，我嫌回家耽搁工作，从来不请一次假。我还虚心学习汉族工人的先进经验，带动藏族工人一起学。因此，我在去年被选为全国公路劳动模范。
    去年六月，我开完劳动模范代表大会，回到七十道班，同志们都围拢来，要我讲在北京看到什么，学到什么。我把在北京听到的先进经验给他们讲了两个晚上，大伙儿都很高兴，表示要好好学习。
    不几天，我被调到六十八道班了，我又把许多先进经验告诉第六十八道班。比方，原先我们挑土，要放下扁担，等土筐装满之后，把扁担的勾勾安起，再担起走。现在，我们在扁担跟土筐之间安上滑圈。扁担不离土筐，也不离肩膀。担起土来，就比以前快多了。有些人嫌安滑圈麻烦。每天下了工，我就帮他们安。我们还推广了“竖筛筛土法”，突破了定额80％。
    铺路面要用很多粗砂，原来计划取砂土的地方离工地有三百多公尺。我想起大会经常谈的“就地取材”“缩短运距”等道理，就拿起铲子到工地附近找砂子。铲了几处才找到一块泥砂地，离工地只有几十公尺。
    去年十二月份，从山上下来了一股水，流进我们打的涵洞里。水冻成了硬绑绑的冰，我们就打冰。我们冻得身上直打哆嗦，可是，我们不肯停手，提前好几天把冰洞打通了。
    1955年，我们六十八道班超额完成计划18.6％，被评为康定国道管理局的模范班。我这次被选为出席全国先进生产者代表会议的代表，又来北京开会。我要更虚心地学习，把先进经验带回去推广。我要更努力地工作，做一个更先进的生产者。
