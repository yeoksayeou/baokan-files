Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade of the People's Republic of China and head of the Chinese trade delegation to Egypt, said today that the new friendly cooperation and economic and cultural relations established between China and Egypt are beneficial to consolidating peace in the Asian-African region and the world. Ye Jizhuang said that this friendly relationship is the result of the joint efforts of the governments and peoples of China and Egypt to implement the spirit of the Bandung Conference and realize the resolutions on economic cooperation made at the conference. This cooperative relationship is in line with the interests of the people of both countries.

Ye Jizhuang made a radio speech on the new stage of development in Sino-Egyptian economic relations on the Central People's Broadcasting Station tonight. He led a trade delegation to Egypt for a month-long friendly visit from March 16 to April 16 this year.

Ye Jizhuang said that during the talks in Cairo between the Chinese trade delegation and Mohamed Abdu Naser, Minister of Industry and Commerce of the Republic of Egypt, both sides expressed satisfaction with the implementation of the Sino-Egyptian trade agreement of August 1955 and the first protocol for the agreement year. Both sides have full confidence in the great prospects for developing trade between the two countries. During the Chinese trade delegation's stay in Egypt, the two sides reached transactions amounting to four million pounds. The Chinese side purchased a large amount of Egyptian cotton yarn, and the Egyptian side purchased Chinese steel, machinery, and vegetable oil. The Chinese cultural and artistic delegation also visited Egypt, and the two sides signed a cultural cooperation agreement. Now, the Chinese commodity exhibition introducing various aspects of China's economic activities to the Egyptian people is also on display in Cairo and has been welcomed by the Egyptian government and people from all walks of life. These activities will play a significant role in enhancing mutual understanding between the Chinese and Egyptian people and strengthening friendly cooperation, cultural exchanges, and trade relations between China and Egypt. We firmly believe that trade and cultural exchanges between China and Egypt will flourish and surpass what our ancestors achieved.

Ye Jizhuang said that during the visit, the Chinese trade delegation was warmly received by the Egyptian government and people everywhere, and personally felt the deep friendship of the Egyptian people towards the Chinese people. The Chinese trade delegation was deeply impressed by all of this and felt that Egypt has many things worth learning from us in terms of agricultural technology, culture, and art.

In his speech, Ye Jizhuang also praised the remarkable achievements of the Egyptian people in building their own country. He said that according to the introduction by Famer, Director of the Egyptian Production Committee, and the observations of the Chinese trade delegation, Egypt's economic progress in the three years since the revolution has been rapid. With the resolute efforts of the Egyptian government and people, Egypt is fully capable of building its country into a prosperous and strong one along an independent path. We are willing to see and sincerely wish our Egyptian friends greater victories.

    叶季壮谈中埃经济关系发展新阶段
    新华社17日讯　中华人民共和国对外贸易部部长、中国赴埃及贸易访问团团长叶季壮今天说，中国和埃及两国间已经建立起来的新的友好合作和经济、文化关系，对于巩固亚非地区和全世界的和平是有益的。叶季壮说，这种友好关系是中埃两国的政府和人民为了贯彻万隆会议的精神，实现万隆会议关于经济合作的决议所做的共同努力的成果。这种合作关系是符合两国人民的利益的。
    叶季壮今天晚上在中央人民广播电台发表了关于中埃经济关系发展的新阶段的广播讲话。他曾经在今年三月十六日到四月十六日率领贸易访问团到埃及作了一个月的友好访问。
    叶季壮说，这次中国贸易访问团在开罗同埃及共和国工商部部长穆罕默德·阿卜·努赛尔所进行的会谈中，双方对于1955年8月中埃贸易协定和第一个协定年度议定书的执行情况一致表示满意。双方对于发展两国间贸易的远大前途具有充分的信心。中国贸易访问团在埃及期间，中埃双方达成了四百万英镑金额的交易。中国方面购买了大量的埃及棉纱，埃及方面购买了中国的钢材、机器和植物油等。中国文化艺术代表团也访问了埃及，中埃双方还签订了文化合作协定。现在，向埃及人民介绍中国经济活动各方面情况的中国商品展览会也已经在开罗展出，受到埃及政府和各界人士的欢迎。这些活动对于增进中埃两国人民的相互了解，加强中埃两国之间的友好合作、文化交流和贸易往来都将有重大的作用。我们坚信中埃两国间的贸易来往和文化交流一定会蒸蒸日上，比我们的祖先做得更好。
    叶季壮说，中国贸易访问团在访问期间到处受到埃及政府和人民的热情招待，亲身感受到埃及人民对中国人民的深厚友谊。中国贸易访问团对这一切留下了很深刻的印象，并且觉得埃及在农业技术和文化、艺术等方面有许多值得我们学习的东西。
    叶季壮在讲话中还赞美埃及人民在建设自己国家的事业中所获得的显著成就。他说，根据埃及生产委员会主任法默的介绍和中国贸易访问团的观察，埃及革命后三年来经济上的进步是很快的。在埃及政府和人民的坚决努力之下，埃及完全有可能沿着独立的道路把自己的国家建成一个富强的国家。我们愿意看到，并且诚恳地预祝我们的埃及朋友获得更大的胜利。
