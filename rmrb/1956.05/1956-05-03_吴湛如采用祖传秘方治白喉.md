    Wu Zhanru Uses Ancestral Secret Recipe to Treat Diphtheria
    The traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Wu Zhanru in Xi'an City uses an ancestral secret recipe, "Diphtheria Powder," to treat diphtheria with very good results.
    Diphtheria is an infectious disease. Wu Zhanru uses twelve kinds of Chinese herbal medicines, including bezoar, pearl, and amber, to prepare a fine-grained powder, which is sprinkled on the affected area two or three times a day. Mild cases can be cured in two or three days, and severe cases can be cured in five or six days. At the end of last year, the Xi'an Infectious Diseases Hospital used "Diphtheria Powder" to treat eighteen diphtheria patients, and the cure rate reached over 83%, proving that this medicine has a strong bactericidal effect on diphtheria bacilli.
    Currently, the Xi'an City Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine is helping Wu Zhanru summarize and organize this treatment method.

    吴湛如采用祖传秘方治白喉
    西安市中医吴湛如采用祖传秘方“白喉散”治疗白喉症有很好的效果。
    白喉是一种传染病。吴湛如用牛黄、珍珠、琥珀等十二种中药配成细微粒状的散剂，撒在患处，每天撒二、三次，轻的两三天内就可以痊愈，重的五、六天内也可以治好。去年年底，西安市传染病院用“白喉散”治疗十八名白喉患者，治愈率达到83％以上，证明这种药对白喉杆菌有较强的杀菌效能。
    目前，西安市中医学会正在帮助吴湛如总结和整理这种治疗方法。
