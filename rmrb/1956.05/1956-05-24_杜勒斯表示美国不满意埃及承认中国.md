Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 23rd: U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles said at a press conference on May 22nd that the United States "regretted" Egypt's recognition of the government of the People's Republic of China.

At the meeting, Dulles avoided answering reporters' questions about the U.S. State Department's increasingly "blunt" view of Prime Minister Nasser, only reiterating that the United States "disapproved" of Egypt's recognition of China.

Dulles also said that if the United States had the impression that Egypt would accept Soviet aid to build the Aswan Dam, then the United States would be "unlikely" to invest in building the dam.

Dulles spoke about Britain's desire to expand trade with China. He acknowledged that British Foreign Secretary Lloyd had discussed the issue with him. The British government had indeed expressed its intention to make more liberal use of the "exception" procedure of the embargo to export goods to China. Dulles said that the United States did not know what practical consequences this intention of Britain would have, and that it was "not necessary to conclude" at this time that it would cause a "general collapse" of trade controls.

Dulles said, when talking about the negotiations currently being conducted in Washington by the President and Foreign Minister of Indonesia, that the United States could not support Indonesia on the issue of West Irian.

When pressed by reporters, Dulles expressed his views on the divergence of interpretations of the Soviet disarmament statement among himself, Defense Secretary Wilson, and President's Special Advisor on Disarmament Stassen. Dulles said that "almost infinite" speculation could be made about determining the reasons for the Soviet Union to take this measure. He said he did not believe that the Soviet government's decision would lead to a weakening of the "Soviet armed forces," and insisted that the Soviet decision was aimed at pursuing "propaganda" purposes.

One reporter pointed out that Dulles's statement was "somewhat contrary" to the general view, which considered it "an initiative" by the Soviet Union to ease international tensions. Dulles said he was unwilling to discuss such specific views.

Dulles even said that the United States had also reduced "quite a lot" of its armed forces, but that this reduction did not "weaken" the US military power, but made it "stronger." U.S. Defense Secretary Wilson had admitted a few days earlier that the current U.S. armed forces of approximately 2.85 million were the largest number of U.S. armed forces in peacetime.

Dulles said that expanding the political aspect of the Atlantic Group was one of the issues under consideration. He said that, so far, the group had mainly worked as a military alliance. He said the United States was willing to consider taking a "gradual step" in this area.

Dulles also said that the United States would continue to try to restrict Japanese textile exports to the United States. The United States would not be willing to help make up for Japan's fishing deficit like the Soviet Union.

### 杜勒斯表示美国不满意埃及承认中国

    杜勒斯表示美国不满意埃及承认中国
    新华社23日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯五月二十二日在记者招待会上说，美国对于埃及承认中华人民共和国政府一事，“感到遗憾”。
    杜勒斯在会上避免答复记者提出的关于美国国务院对纳赛尔总理的看法越来越“粗卤”的问题，只是再一次强调，美国“不赞成”埃及承认中国。
    杜勒斯还说：假若美国有埃及会接受苏联援助建筑阿斯旺水坝的印象，那末，美国“不大可能”去投资建筑这个水坝。
    杜勒斯谈到英国想扩大同中国的贸易的问题。他承认英国外交大臣劳埃德曾经同他讨论过这个问题。英国政府的确曾经表示要比较自由地利用禁运条款的“例外”程序，向中国输出货物。杜勒斯说：美国不知道英国这个意图会产生什么样的实际后果，现在也“没有必要得出结论”认为这将使贸易管制“发生总的崩溃”。
    杜勒斯在谈到印度尼西亚总统和外交部长目前在华盛顿进行谈判的问题的时候说：美国不可能在西伊里安的问题上支持印度尼西亚。
    在记者追问下，杜勒斯就他本人、国防部长威尔逊和总统裁军问题特别顾问史塔逊对苏联裁军声明解释的分歧表示了意见。杜勒斯说，可以对判定苏联采取这个措施的理由作“几乎是无穷”的推测。他说他不认为苏联政府的决定会导致“苏联武装力量”的削弱，并且硬说，苏联这个决定是为了追求“宣传”的目的。
    有记者指出，杜勒斯的这种说法同一般人的看法“有点相背驰”，一般人认为这是苏联争取缓和国际紧张局势的“一种主动行动”。杜勒斯说，他不愿意谈这种具体看法。
    杜勒斯甚至说，美国也裁减过“相当多”的武装部队，不过，这种裁减不是使得美国的军事力量“减弱”了，而是“更加强大”了。美国国防部长威尔逊在几天前曾经承认过，现在美国武装部队约有二百八十五万人，是美国在和平时期最大的武装部队数字。
    杜勒斯说，扩大大西洋集团的政治方面，是正在考虑中的问题之一。他说，到目前为止，这个集团主要是作为一个军事联盟而进行工作的。他表示美国愿意考虑在这一方面采取一种“渐进的步骤”。
    杜勒斯还说：美国将继续设法限制日本纺织品对美国的输出。美国不会愿意像苏联那样帮助弥补日本的渔业赤字。
