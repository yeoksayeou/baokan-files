To encourage members to actively study and improve technology, many agricultural production cooperatives in Yunnan Province have increased the work points for technical labor.

Agricultural production technology in Yunnan was originally relatively low, so encouraging members to learn technology, especially mastering new agricultural implements, is very important. However, in the past, agricultural cooperatives did not reasonably increase remuneration for technical labor when formulating labor quotas. Most members were not enthusiastic about spending time learning technology in order to earn more work points. After the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party promptly pointed out this situation, now several agricultural cooperatives in Jinning, Yuxi, Yiliang, Baoshan, Songming and other counties have appropriately increased the remuneration for technical labor when dividing job grades and labor remuneration. The enthusiasm of members for studying and adopting advanced production technologies has greatly increased.

When formulating labor quotas, agricultural cooperatives in Jinning County classified plowing with a horse-drawn plow as first-class work, plowing with a bullock-drawn plow and using a walking plow as second-class, and plowing with an old-fashioned plow as third-class, stipulating different labor remuneration. Among them, the Shangsuan Agricultural Cooperative also stipulated that each member who teaches a horse to pull a plow could get thirteen work points. Now, all one hundred horses in this cooperative have learned to pull plows, and the 132 walking plows that were not used in the past have also been utilized.

In sideline production, many agricultural cooperatives have also stipulated different remuneration based on the level of labor technology, so that many sideline occupations such as silkworm breeding and beekeeping, which require certain technologies and which members were originally unwilling to engage in, have also been developed.

    鼓励社员学习技术和改进技术
    云南省许多农业合作社提高技术劳动的工分
    云南省不少农业生产合作社为鼓励社员积极学习技术和改进技术，提高了需要技术的劳动工分。
    云南原来的农业生产技术较低，鼓励社员学习技术，特别是掌握新式农具的技术很重要。但是，过去农业社在制定劳动定额中没有对技术劳动合理地提高报酬，大多数社员为多得工分，对花时间学习技术的情绪不高。这种情况经中共云南省委及时指出以后，现在晋宁、玉溪、宜良、保山、嵩明等县的若干农业社，在划分工种等级和劳动报酬时，都适当地提高了技术劳动的报酬。社员们学习和采用先进生产技术的积极性大大提高。
    晋宁县各农业合作社在制定劳动定额时，把马犁地劳动列为一等活计，牛犁地和使用步犁犁地列为二等，用老式犁犁地则列为三等，规定了不同的劳动报酬。其中上蒜农业合作社还规定：社员教会一匹马拉犁，每人可得十三个工分。现在，这个社的一百匹马都已经学会了拉犁，过去社里没有用的132张步犁也都已利用起来。
    在副业生产上，许多农业合作社也根据劳动技术的高低规定了不同的报酬，使许多需要有一定技术而原来社员不愿经营的养蚕、养蜂等副业也开展起来。　（据新华社讯）
