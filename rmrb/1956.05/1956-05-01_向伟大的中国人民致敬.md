　　Salutations to the Great Chinese People
　　Aleksey Miroslav, Electric Welder, First Machine Manufacturing Plant, Brno, Czechoslovakia
    Dear Chinese friends!
    Before May Day, we completed the production of two turbines for the Dagukuo Hydroelectric Station in Heilongjiang, which makes me very happy. We have already sent these two turbines to your great country. Now we are manufacturing boiler units with a steam generation capacity of 35 tons per hour for China.
    We work at the First Machine Manufacturing Plant in Brno, which belongs to the Gottwald enterprise, where we manufacture turbines and steam boilers. Welding is one of the most representative links in our production process. Therefore, a large number of engineers and technicians are engaged in the study of welding technology. To this end, a large amount of capital has been allocated.
    I am an electric welder, doing the work of welding turbines. When I work, I often think about how to do it faster, better, and more economically, so I have put forward more than 20 rationalization proposals. As a result of the implementation of these proposals, the profitability of our production has begun to increase greatly. I thought a lot about how to extend the life of turbine blades and prevent them from being eroded by moisture. I came up with a method: plating them with hard metal without removing the turbine rotor. So, I immediately started working. Practice has proved that this hard metal welding method has achieved good results: the life of the turbine has been extended. When welding the blades to the main shaft, the single-sided welding method is used. Because the blades often deform automatically, and it takes a lot of time to correct them, I made templates and covers for the blades, so that the blades are firmly maintained in the required state. The quality of the weld is greatly improved, and there are no defective products. At the same time, in this case, only one welder is needed to complete all the work, instead of two. In addition, I have also improved the welding and other work when repairing gate valves.
    Some gate valves weighing 30 to 40 tons have caused us particularly great difficulties. In order to repair damaged gate valves, they need to be transported from the turbine workshop to the foundry, heated, and then welded. During transportation, they need to be welded to the gate valve transporter. In order to simplify the entire work process, I spent a lot of time. I made a cover with steel plate material. I installed some nozzles inside the cover. Overnight, I heated them to 300 degrees. Then, in the morning, I welded them together. Therefore, the operation process is greatly accelerated, so all the auxiliary operations related to moving the heavy gate valves are no longer needed.
    However, all the staff of our First Machine Manufacturing Plant in Brno are not satisfied with the achievements they have made and are constantly striving to improve the welding operation process. We have successfully overcome many difficulties. The adoption of many new welding methods has greatly improved production.
    We know that all our efforts are for the consolidation of the cause of world peace and for the further prosperity of the countries of the peace camp (to which our two friendly countries also belong). On the occasion of the May Day festival of the working people of the world, we extend our brotherly and comradely greetings to our dear Chinese friends, and wish your country to advance more rapidly on the road of building socialism – building a happy future.

　　向伟大的中国人民致敬
　　捷克斯洛伐克布尔诺第一机器制造厂电焊工人  阿列克赛·米罗斯拉夫
    亲爱的中国朋友们！
    在“五一”节以前，我们为黑龙江大库房水电站制成了两部涡轮机，这是使我高兴的事情。我们已经把这两部涡轮机送到你们伟大的国家去了。现在我们又在为中国制造蒸汽发生量为每小时三十五吨的锅炉机组。
    我们在哥特瓦尔德企业所属的布尔诺第一机器制造厂工作，我们在这里制造涡轮机和蒸汽锅炉。焊接工作是我们生产工作过程中的最有代表性的环节之一。因此有为数众多的工程师和技术员从事焊接工艺的研究。为此，并拨出了大量的资金。
    我是一个电焊工，做焊接涡轮机的工作。我在工作的时候常常想，要怎样才能做得更快、更好、更省，因此我提出了二十多条合理化建议。由于实行了这些建议，我们生产的赢利性开始大大提高了。我想得非常多：用什么方法延长汽轮机轮叶的寿命，避免使它们受湿气的侵蚀。我想到一个方法：不用卸下汽轮机的转子，在它们上面镀上硬质金属。于是，我马上就开始工作。实践证明，这种硬质金属焊接法得到了很好的结果：汽轮机的寿命延长了。在把轮叶焊接到主轴上去时，采用单面焊接法，由于轮叶常常自动变形，而矫正它们要用很多时间，我为轮叶做了样板和外罩，这样一来，轮叶就被牢固地保持在所需要的状态。焊缝的质量大大提高，废品没有了。同时在这种情况下，不需要两个焊工，只要一个焊工就能完成所有的工作。此外，我还改进了修理汽门阀时的焊接等工作。
    重达三十吨到四十吨的一些汽门阀，曾使我们遭到特别大的困难。为了修理损坏的汽门阀，就需要把它们从汽轮机工段运往铸造车间，加热后进行焊接。在运输过程中，并需要把它焊接在汽门阀的运输器上。为了简化整个工作过程，我曾费去很多时间。我用钢版材料做了一个外罩。在外罩内装了一些喷嘴。在一夜间，把它们加热到三百度。以后，在早晨，我就把它们焊接起来。因此，操作过程就大大加快起来，这样，所有有关移动笨重的汽门阀的辅助操作就不再需要了。
    然而，所有我们布尔诺第一机器制造厂的工作人员都不满足于已获得的成就，并不断地致力于改进焊接的操作过程。我们成功地克服了许多困难。采用许多新的焊接法，大大提高了生产。
    我们知道，我们的一切努力都是为了巩固世界和平事业，为了和平阵营各国（我们两个友好国家也属于这个阵营）的进一步繁荣。在全世界劳动人民的节日——“五一”节的时候，我们向亲爱的中国朋友致以兄弟的和同志的敬礼，祝你们的国家在建设社会主义——建设幸福的未来的道路上更加迅速地前进。
