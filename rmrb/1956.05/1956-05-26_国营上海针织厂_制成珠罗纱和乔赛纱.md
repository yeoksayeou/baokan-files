    State-Run Shanghai Knitting Factory
    Produces Tulle and Marquisette
    A kind of light and soft tulle and marquisette has recently been successfully trial-produced at the state-run Shanghai Knitting Factory.
    Tulle is a good raw material for making mosquito nets, as it is more durable and breathable than ordinary mosquito net cloth. Marquisette is a good raw material for making summer shirts and high-grade window screens, looking like silk fabrics from afar. Many commercial procurement departments in Shanghai have placed orders with the state-run Shanghai Knitting Factory. At present, the state-run Shanghai Knitting Factory has begun small-scale production.

    国营上海针织厂
    制成珠罗纱和乔赛纱
    一种质地轻柔的珠罗纱和乔赛纱最近在国营上海针织厂试制成功。
    珠罗纱是制作蚊帐的好原料，它比普通的蚊帐布耐用又透空气。乔赛纱是一种制作夏季衬衣和高级窗纱的好原料，远远望去如同丝织品一样。上海许多商业采购部门纷纷同国营上海针织厂订货。目前，国营上海针织厂已经开始小批生产。
