Throughout the country, urban and rural working people spent the "May Day" International Labor Day with joy and happiness.

This year, the rallies and parades celebrating "May Day" across the country vividly demonstrated the heroic spirit of the motherland advancing by leaps and bounds. In Xining City, railway workers, who had never been seen before in Qinghai Province, appeared in the parade. They held up banners saying, "Strive to open the railway to Xining ahead of schedule in 1957." The ranks of petroleum and geological personnel who came to this city from all over the country were also larger than last year. They held up banners saying, "Work hard to find large oil fields and turn Qaidam into a sea of oil as soon as possible," and carried charts showing that they had completed 139.1% of the drilling plan from January to April this year, marching forward happily in the ranks. In Lanzhou City, the workers building the Lanzhou Refinery stated at the celebration meeting that they would complete the construction task half a year ahead of schedule. On the Gobi Desert inside and outside Jiayuguan, the workers constructing the Beida River Bridge, the largest bridge project of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway this year, stated that they would complete the bridge eleven days ahead of schedule within the next four days. In the Anshan City parade, the employees of Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction Corporation were at the forefront, proposing to complete a construction task for Anshan Iron and Steel every two and a half days on average in the second quarter. After overfulfilling the pig iron task by more than 3,000 tons in April, the ironworkers implemented a new quota from the 1st, producing more than 200 tons of pig iron for the country every day. In Zhengzhou City, the emerging textile industrial base, nearly 5,000 textile workers celebrated "May Day" with more than 55,000 representatives from all walks of life in the city, bringing new production achievements. The employees of the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory created 233 new records as a gift for "May Day". In the parade of more than 80,000 people in Chengdu City, more than 1,000 railway worker representatives who built the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, Neijiang-Kunming Railway, and Sichuan-Guizhou Railway guaranteed to build 1,182 kilometers of railways for the people of Southwest China within the first five-year plan, saving the country 100 million yuan. Among the workers of various ethnic groups at the celebration meeting in Urumqi, there were employees of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway Hami-Urumqi section survey team who completed the April plan four days ahead of schedule, and employees of the Autonomous Region No. 1 Engineering Company who came from Changchun this year to support the construction of Xinjiang. The charts carried by each team showed that they had achieved many results in their efforts to complete the first five-year plan.

Advanced producers, who are emerging in increasing numbers throughout the country, were given a particularly warm welcome at celebration meetings and parades in various places. In Kunming City, more than 2,000 workers who had recently won the title of advanced producer participated in the parade. In Luoyang City, more than 1,000 advanced producers and more than 200 advanced collectives participated in the celebration meeting. In the parade of more than 60,000 people in Changsha City, the forging workshop of the state-owned Changsha Machine Tool Factory, led by advanced producer Ye Cailin, had reached the output value level of the five-year plan ahead of schedule on April 29. In Taiyuan City, one of the main industrial cities in Guannei, there was a team of more than 3,000 advanced producers in the parade. Due to the widespread development of the advanced producer movement, the total industrial output value of Taiyuan City has now completed 88.5% of the five-year plan. The employees of twelve construction enterprises have completed an average of 111% of the labor quota. In Harbin City, more than 20,000 advanced producers, wearing big red flowers awarded to them by factories and enterprises, walked at the front of their units in the parade.

Also celebrating the holiday on the 1st were the working people of various ethnic minorities throughout the country, as well as farmers, young students, cultural and scientific circles, and others. More than 5,000 Tibetan and Han workers and staff in Lhasa gathered in a huge white tent in Xuecelinka (garden) on the 1st to celebrate International Labor Day. Men and women workers were all dressed in neat clothes. According to the custom of celebrating the festival, Tibetan workers also brought highland barley wine to the venue. In the mountain city of Guiyang, more than 35,000 Han, Miao, and Buyi working people participated in the parade with their brilliant production achievements. About half of this parade was industrial workers. There were also railway workers appearing for the first time in the ranks. They guaranteed to deliver the construction data of the Sichuan-Guizhou line one year ahead of schedule, that is, before the end of August this year, and to reduce the cost of railway engineering by 30 million yuan in the design of the Sichuan-Guizhou and Guizhou-Guangxi lines. In Fuzhou and Xiamen cities in Fujian Province, farmers, intellectuals, handicraft workers, and industrialists and businessmen who have embarked on the socialist road celebrated the holiday together with the workers. In subtropical Nanning City, members of the Dongping Agricultural Production Cooperative and the emerging Vegetable Production Cooperative, who had rushed into the city from the suburbs to participate in the holiday celebration, had built a reservoir two days ago that can irrigate 2,000 mu of land. In Nanjing City, about 100,000 people, including workers, students, and staff, participated in holiday celebrations such as boat races, costume photography, concerts, and dance parties in Xuanwu Lake Park. Many scientists and educators also spent a happy holiday here with their spouses and children.
