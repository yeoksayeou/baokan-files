    Sichuan Province Discovers Over Seventy Valuable Industrial Raw Materials
    The Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has recently discovered over seventy valuable industrial raw materials.

    Many of these newly discovered industrial raw materials are urgently needed by industrial departments. Wild plants such as *Menghua* bark and mountain cotton bark in Qijiang, Wulong, and other counties were previously unknown to farmers and were burned as firewood. This year, after identification by the local supply and marketing cooperative, it was confirmed that the fibers of these plants have the characteristics of being thin, long, soft, and tough, making them excellent raw materials for manufacturing special high-grade paper such as stencil paper and typing paper. Therefore, procurement was immediately organized. By May, more than 200,000 *jin* of mountain cotton bark had been supplied to industrial departments in Zhejiang Province as papermaking raw materials.

    Wild plants such as red root and acorn bowl discovered in the Fuling, Jiangjin, and other regions are rich in glue and are good raw materials for manufacturing baking glue. It can replace imported baking glue and save the country foreign exchange. The Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Department has already shipped more than 20,000 *dan* of red root purchased out of the province for processing.

    At present, the Sichuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Department, with the assistance of relevant departments, is continuing to conduct a comprehensive survey of industrial raw materials throughout the province and is conducting chemical analysis and identification of other newly discovered varieties.

    四川省发现七十多种有价值的工业原料
    四川省供销合作社最近发现了七十多种有价值的工业原料。
    这批新发现的工业原料，许多是当前工业部门很需要的。綦江、武隆等县的梦花皮、山棉皮等野生植物，过去农民不知道它们的用途，当作柴烧。今年经过当地供销合作社的鉴别，证实这些植物的纤维具有细长、柔软、坚韧的特点，是制造特种高级纸如蜡纸、打字纸的优良原料，于是立即组织采购。到五月份，已经有二十多万斤山棉皮供应浙江省工业部门作造纸原料。
    在涪陵、江津等专区发现的红根、橡碗等野生植物，含胶丰富，是制造烤胶的很好原料。它能代替进口的烤胶，给国家节省外汇。四川省供销合作部门已经把收购的二万多担红根运出省外加工。
    目前，四川省供销合作部门正在有关部门协助下，继续进行全省工业原料的普查工作，并且把发现的其它新品种进行化验鉴定。
