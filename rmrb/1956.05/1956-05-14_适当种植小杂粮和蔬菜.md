    Appropriately Planting Minor Grains and Vegetables
    Ma Jueweng
    Recently, some areas have greatly reduced the planting area of minor grains such as mung beans, adzuki beans, barley, millet, and vegetables and melons. For example, in Weijiazhuang Township, Lu'an County, Shanxi Province, 122 mu of minor grains were planted in 1955, but only 30 mu are planned to be planted this year. Some agricultural production cooperatives in Xiyang County plan not to grow vegetables, and members must purchase vegetables from other places. The Chengguan Agricultural Cooperative in Xianghe County, Hebei Province, planted 240 mu of melons and vegetables last year, but will not plant any this year.
    In order to achieve increased production of grain and cotton, it is appropriate to convert some low-yield crops to high-yield crops. However, while expanding high-yield crops, it is wrong to blindly reduce the planting of local habitually grown minor grains and vegetables and melons. Because minor grains and vegetables and melons have a wide range of uses, millet and barley among minor grains are the main food in some areas. Millet can also be made into cakes and pastries, and barley is an important raw material for brewing. Mung beans, adzuki beans, broad beans, peas, etc., can not only be made into a variety of delicious foods, but some are also important export materials. Vegetables and melons are the main non-staple food for urban and rural people. Minor grains generally have a short growing period, and some are good crops suitable for multiple cropping. They also play a certain role in coordinating reasonable crop rotation and improving soil fertility. Blindly reducing the planting area of these crops is detrimental to the production and life of urban and rural people.
    At present, many areas are in the season for sowing minor grains and vegetables and melons. Agricultural production leading departments in various places should seize the time to conduct an inspection, and appropriately arrange the production of minor grains and vegetables and melons according to the requirements of the national plan, combined with the local production characteristics, the needs of the masses, and planting habits. For minor grains and vegetables and melons that are suitable for local planting and have many uses, they should be appropriately developed.
    Various places have rich experience in high-yield production of minor grains and vegetables and melons. Summarizing and promoting these experiences can make these crops grow better and yield more.

    适当种植小杂粮和蔬菜
    马矍翁
    近来有些地方大量地压缩了绿豆、小豆、大麦、糜子等小杂粮和蔬菜瓜类的种植面积。例如山西省潞安县魏家庄乡，1955年种小杂粮122亩，今年只计划种30亩，昔阳县有些农业生产合作社计划不种蔬菜，社员吃菜也要向外地购买。河北省香河县城关农业合作社去年种瓜菜等240亩，今年一亩不种。
    为了实现粮棉增产，适当地把一部分低产作物改种为高产作物是应当的。但是在扩大高产作物的同时，盲目缩减当地习惯种植的小杂粮和蔬菜瓜类则是不对的。因为小杂粮和蔬菜瓜类用途很广，小杂粮当中的糜黍、大麦等在某些地区是主要食粮，糜黍还可做糕饼点心，大麦又是酿酒的重要原料，绿豆、小豆、蚕豆、豌豆等不仅可做成多种多样的美味食品，有的还是出口的重要物资。蔬菜瓜类，是城乡人民的主要副食品。小杂粮的生长期一般较短，有些还是适合复种的良好作物，它们在配合合理轮栽，提高土壤肥力方面也有一定的作用。盲目压缩这些作物的种植面积，对城乡人民的生产、生活都是不利的。
    目前许多地区正是播种小杂粮和蔬菜瓜类的季节，各地农业生产领导部门应该抓紧时间进行一次检查，根据国家计划的要求，结合当地生产特点、群众的需要和种植习惯，适当安排小杂粮和蔬菜瓜类的生产。对于适合当地栽种，用途较多的小杂粮和蔬菜瓜类，更要适当发展。
    小杂粮和蔬菜瓜类的丰产经验，各地都有，总结和推广这些经验，就能够把这些作物种得更好，收得更多。
