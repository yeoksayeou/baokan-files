    Fish Fry in the Han River
    The Han River, the largest tributary of the Yangtze River, was historically considered a "bitter water" river that did not produce fish fry. However, it has now been proven that this statement is incorrect.
    From May 10th to 14th, a survey team organized by the Hubei Provincial Aquatic Products Department installed twelve seine nets on the water surface near Laohekou in the upper reaches of the Han River for trial fishing. As a result, they caught more than forty bowls of fish fry within five days. Among the fish fry caught, grass carp accounted for 50%, silver carp accounted for 30%, and black carp and others accounted for 20%.
    On the 10th, the survey team also discovered three large grass carp parent fish (fish with eggs), weighing ten to thirty jin each, caught by fishermen on a fishing boat near Laohekou, proving that many parent fish are currently seeking spawning grounds upstream. (Xinhua News Agency)

    汉水有鱼苗
    长江最大的支流——汉水，在历史上曾经被认为是一条“水苦”不长鱼苗的河流，但是现在证明这种说法是不正确的。
    五月十日到十四日，湖北省水产部门组织的一个调查队，在汉水上游老河口附近水面安装十二部绠网进行试捞的结果，在五天时间以内捞得鱼苗四十多碗。捞获的鱼苗中，草鱼占50％，鲢鱼占30％，青鱼等占20％。
    十日，这个调查队还在老河口附近的一只渔船上，发现了渔民捕获的十斤到三十斤的大草鱼亲鱼（有卵的鱼）三尾，证明目前有许多亲鱼正在上游寻找产卵场所。　（新华社）
