Are Coal Mine Accidents Inevitable?

　　Lu Lingchang, Coal Mining Team Leader, Hegang Xingshan Coal Mine

　　Our team has not had any serious injuries or fatalities for nine years. This is because all the comrades in our team pay great attention to safe production.

　　Since the resumption of production at our Hegang Xingshan Mine in 1946, the leadership has continuously conducted safety education for us. After I became the coal mining team leader in 1947, the branch secretary, pit leader, and union chairman often discussed this issue with me. Initially, everyone didn't pay enough attention to this issue, believing that it was impossible to avoid injuries and fatalities when working in a coal mine. My thinking was similar to everyone else's. However, I thought, since the leadership is so concerned about our safety, why shouldn't we be concerned ourselves? So, I and Li Xuqian, the union group leader, came up with this method based on the fact that in our pit, large pieces of coal from the roof often collapsed and injured people: after each blasting, a special person would first use a long wooden pole to knock down any loose coal on the roof and walls before everyone went in to load coal onto the cars. When loading the cars, we also paid attention to any sounds or changes in the roof, and if there was any danger, we would quickly evacuate.

　　The leadership thought our method was very good and helped us summarize it as the experience of "frequent looking, frequent listening, and frequent checking," which was promoted in all teams.

　　Next, we went to the retreating stope. Our mine has thick coal seams, and after a few days of retreat mining, we mined out a large void that was more than ten meters high, twenty meters wide, and forty meters long. With such a high roof, the wooden pole couldn't reach, making it difficult to check. At the same time, the roof was made of stone, making it difficult to hear any sounds. At this time, I was worried about danger and always stared at the roof, watching for any changes. One day, I saw that a small crack in the roof, which had been dripping water drop by drop the day before, was now flowing in a line. I immediately said to old Cui, who was older:

　　"Old Cui, look, that crack is flowing water in a line."

　　"Do your work, it's okay!" Old Cui stopped his shovel, looked at the roof, said simply, and buried his head in his work again.

　　At this time, I carefully looked at the crack again and saw that the water flow was getting bigger and bigger. I thought something was wrong, so I immediately told everyone to quickly send the loaded coal cars out and also gathered shovels, picks, chisels, and other tools next to the ventilation door.

　　Just then, suddenly, with a few loud crashes and rumbling sounds, the ground shook, and a cloud of smoke rushed out of the ventilation door, making it impossible to see anyone within a few meters. How dangerous, the tunnel roof collapsed!

　　This incident left a deep impression on everyone. Since then, the comrades in our team have paid great attention to safe production, earnestly implemented safety measures, and complied with operating procedures. If anyone was not careful, everyone would criticize him and help him correct his behavior.

　　After our team began to implement mechanized coal mining in 1950, the safety conditions in the pit were fundamentally improved. The roof was only one person's hand high, making it easy to check; a support was propped up every meter or so, making the tunnel very strong. As long as the engineering quality is fully qualified, the work is safe. We strictly inspected the engineering quality, and any unqualified work was reworked, thus continuing to maintain a safe production record.

　　At the end of 1953, our team implemented "mixed-occupation" coal mining on the basis of safe production, drawing fourteen people from the original thirty-plus to engage in tunneling, which increased labor productivity by more than one-third. As a result, new problems arose in the team. Zhang Zhaopin, nicknamed "Chatterbox," bragged to others: "No team can catch up with our team. Let anyone who doesn't believe it try!" He became complacent. One day, I saw him carrying a chisel and standing on the electric chute (transportation machinery), letting the electric chute carry him away, and he even acted like he was very capable.

　　This was dangerous. Two months ago, a worker in the first pit did the same thing, and as a result, one end of the chisel was caught on a support, and the other end was caught in his crotch, and the electric chute continued to turn, and he couldn't stop, so he was stabbed to death by the chisel. I immediately stopped Zhang Zhaopin:

　　"Old Zhang, what are you doing..."

　　When he heard me call him, he jumped down. But he pretended that nothing had happened and asked me, "What's the matter?"

　　"Can you walk on this?"

　　"Yes, no." He was still a little nonchalant.

　　"Don't you remember the bloody lesson of the first pit? Does the regulations allow this?" I continued to say to him, "If something goes wrong, you will suffer, and the country will also suffer losses."

　　Later, the leadership helped our team criticize this arrogance, correct this paralysis and carelessness, and the behavior of violating operating procedures.

　　Our experience is that we must continuously carry out safety production education so that everyone can maintain a high degree of vigilance at all times in order to achieve long-term safe production. It is under such continuous education that our team has achieved no serious injuries or fatalities for nine years and has overfulfilled the state plan. (Reported by Xun Hai)

　　煤矿伤亡事故不可避免吗
    鹤岗兴山煤矿采煤组长　卢令长
    我们小组已经九年没出重伤和死亡事故了。这是因为我们全组同志都很注意安全生产。
    我们鹤岗兴山矿从1946年恢复生产起，领导上就不断地向我们进行安全教育。我在1947年担任采煤组长以后，支部书记、坑长和工会主席都经常同我研究这个问题。最初，大伙对这问题还不够重视，认为在煤矿里干活想不出伤亡事故是不可能的。我的想法跟大伙也差不多。不过，我想，领导上既然这样关心我们的安全，为什么我们自己不关心呢？我和工会小组长李绪千，便根据我们坑里多是顶板上的大煤块崩落下来压坏人的情形，想出了这个办法：每次放完炮后，由专人先用长木杆将顶板和四壁上的不牢实的煤块都通掉，大伙才进去装煤上车。在装车的时候，也随时注意顶板有啥响动和有啥变化，一有危险，大伙就迅速撤出去。
    领导上认为我们这办法很好，帮助我们总结为“勤看、勤听、勤检查”的经验，在各组推行。
    接着，我们就回采坑道。我们的矿是厚煤层，经过几天回采，就采出了一个有十多公尺高、二十多公尺宽、四十多公尺长的大空档。这样高的顶板，木杆子够不着，很难检查，同时顶板是石头的，也很难听出什么声响来。我这时就耽心会出危险，总是瞅着顶板，看它有甚么变化。一天，我看见顶板上的一道小缝头天还在一滴一滴地滴水，现在就淌成线了。我马上就对年纪大的老崔说：
    “老崔，你看那道水缝淌成线了。”
    “干你的活吧，不要紧！”老崔停下大锹，望了望顶板，简单说了这么一句，又埋头干他的活去了。
    我这时又仔细瞅了瞅水缝，看见水流越淌越大。我想不对头，便马上叫大伙将装好的煤车赶快送出去，同时把铁锹、镐头、钎子等好些工具都收拾到风门旁边了。
    就在这时候，突然哗啦啦，轰隆隆几声巨响，地在晃动，风门冲出一团烟雾，几公尺内都看不见人。好险呀，坑道顶板崩坍了！
    这件事情给大伙留下了很深的印象。从此以后，我们小组的同志们都非常注意安全生产，认真贯彻执行安全措施和遵守操作规程。谁要不注意，大伙都批评他，并且帮助他改正。
    我们小组从1950年开始实行机械化采煤后，就从根本上改善了坑里的安全条件。顶板都只有一人一手高，容易检查；每隔一公尺多就撑一架支柱，坑道支得很结实。只要工程质量完全合格，工作就安全。我们就严格检查工程质量，凡是不合规格的，都返工，因此继续保持了安全生产的纪录。
    1953年末，我们小组又在安全生产的基础上实行“混合工种”采煤，从原有三十多人中抽出十四人去搞掘进，使劳动生产率提高三分之一以上，这样一来，组里又发生新问题了。外号叫“吵吵”的张昭品向人吹牛：“哪个组也赶不上我们这组。谁不服气就干干看！”自满起来了。一天，我又看见他扛着钎子站在电溜子（运输机械）上，让电溜子将他带走，并且还装出神气活现的样子。
    这样做可危险啦。两个月前，一坑的一个工人就像他这样做，结果钎子的一端被别在支柱上，一端别到裤裆里了，而电溜子还继续不断转动，他停不下来，便被钎子戳死了。我马上叫住张昭品：
    “老张，你在干啥……”
    他一听是我叫他，便跳下来了。但是，他还装做没事似的，反问我：“怎么的？”
    “你在这上面走，能行吗？”
    “对，不行。”他还有点不在乎。
    “你不记得一坑的血的教训吗？规程上允许这样做吗？”我又继续对他说，“万一出个岔子，自己吃了亏，国家也受损失。”
    后来，领导上又帮助我们组里批判这种骄气，纠正了这种麻痹大意的思想和违犯操作规程的行为。
    我们的体会，就是要不断进行安全生产教育，使每个人时刻保持高度警惕，才能做到长期安全生产。我们小组也就是在这样不断的教育下，才做到九年没出重伤和死亡事故，并且超额完成国家计划的。（荀海记）
