We advocate peace and friendship throughout the world. With this goal as our basic guideline, we have always been and will always strive to further consolidate the existing friendly and good-neighborly relations with countries with which we have diplomatic relations, and we will strive to expand the scope of our friendship with other peace-loving countries in the world. I am confident that Nepal's membership in the United Nations will enable us to maintain and promote the cause of world peace on a larger scale."
