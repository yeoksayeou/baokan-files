Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, May 15th - The Hong Kong business and industrial women's tour group, after returning to Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 13th, immediately expressed their impressions of their tour of the motherland's mainland. Li Huiying, the head of the tour group, told newspaper reporters at the Hong Kong Railway Station: We have gained a lot from this trip. We not only saw the beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland, but also deeply appreciated the greatness of the motherland. Liu Shuixiong, the deputy head of the delegation, said that she saw that the people in the mainland of the motherland are living a stable and happy life, and that industry and commerce are more stable than before. The workers and staff have received good treatment, and the state is very concerned about the welfare work for male and female workers. Many members of the delegation said happily: We have seen that the mainland of the motherland is vigorously developing, and everyone is making the best use of their talents.

The Hong Kong business and industrial women's tour group traveled 8,000 kilometers in the mainland, visited many industrial and mining enterprises in eleven provinces, and met with business and industrial people in many cities. At a symposium before leaving Guangzhou, Li Huiying, the head of the tour group, summarized the three gains of the tour, saying: "We have changed from people sitting in a well and looking at the sky to knowledgeable people; from underestimating ourselves to valuing ourselves; from fearing the Communist Party to loving the Communist Party."
