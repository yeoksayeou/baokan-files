Xinhua News Agency, May 15th - Large-scale wasteland survey work has unfolded in many regions across the country.

    Since late March, a large number of survey and design personnel have begun conducting survey work in the Manas River, Tarim River, and Urumqi River basins in Xinjiang, the Fujin, Heihe, and Mudanjiang regions of Heilongjiang Province, and the vast grasslands and wastelands of Inner Mongolia. The wasteland in the Xuhuai region and Lixiahe area north of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province has already been surveyed. Jiangxi Province has investigated and measured over 600,000 mu of wasteland. Since this spring, Guangxi Province has also conducted soil, vegetation, and agricultural economic surveys on 300,000 mu of surveyed wasteland; and completed the field planning and on-site facilities work for the service areas of three agricultural machine tractor stations.

    This year, all provinces and regions across the country have substantial wasteland survey tasks. The general survey area in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region alone is more than four times greater than last year. The general survey and reconnaissance area in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is also required to reach more than 2 million hectares. In addition to conducting reconnaissance and creating measurements of various scales, provinces and regions will also conduct comprehensive surveys of agriculture, soil, water conservancy, hydrogeology, and agricultural economics to provide reliable data for land utilization and wasteland reclamation.

    The total area of arable wasteland in China is approximately 1.5 billion mu. The planned wasteland survey and design work carried out by provinces and regions will open up infinitely broad prospects for the development of state-owned mechanical farms, ranches, and immigrant reclamation in our country.

    我国可垦荒地总面积约有十五亿亩
    大规模荒地勘察工作在全国许多地区展开
    新华社15日讯　大规模的荒地勘察工作，已经在全国许多地区展开。
    大批的勘察设计人员自三月下旬以来就开始在新疆玛纳斯河、塔里木河和乌鲁木齐河流域，黑龙江省的富锦、黑河、牡丹江地区以及内蒙古广阔的草原和荒地上进行勘察工作。江苏省长江以北的徐淮地区和里下河等地区的荒地都已经勘察完毕。江西省已经调查、测量的荒地面积达到了六十多万亩。广西省今春以来，还在三十万亩经过勘测的荒地上进行了土壤、植物调查和农业经济调查；并且完成了三个农业机器拖拉机站服务地区的场间规划和现场设施工作。
    今年全国各省区的荒地勘察任务都很大。单新疆维吾尔自治区的概查面积就比去年增加四倍多。内蒙古自治区的概测、普查面积也要求达到二百多万公顷。各省、区除了进行踏查和作出各种比例尺的测量以外，还要进行农业、土壤、水利、水文地质和农业经济的综合调查工作，以便为土地利用和荒地开垦提供可靠的资料。
    我国可垦荒地的总面积约有十五亿亩左右。各省、区有计划进行的荒地勘察设计工作，将为我国发展国营机械农场、牧场和移民垦荒开辟无限广阔的前景。
