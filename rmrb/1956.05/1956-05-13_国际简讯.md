Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta: Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Subandrio said on May 8th that it is not yet the time for Indonesia and the Netherlands to exchange ambassadors. He made these remarks to reporters after meeting with the Dutch diplomatic representative in Jakarta, Hagner.

Rome: The Italian Senate passed the electoral bill on May 8th for electing members of the Chamber of Deputies according to proportional representation. All parliamentary groups of all parties, except for extreme right-wing parties, voted in favor of the bill. The Chamber of Deputies had already passed this bill on March 21st.

According to the "Free People's Daily," the West German trade organization "East Asia Association" demanded the lifting of the embargo against China at its annual meeting held in Hamburg. The association opposes the Bonn government's attitude towards trade with China. The association believes that there is an urgent need to revise the embargo policy towards China. They said: The embargo policy cannot prevent China's economic construction, but instead makes it difficult for an old trading partner of China to regain its former position in trade with China.

    △据“自由人民报”报道，西德贸易组织“东亚协会”在汉堡举行的年会上要求取消对中国的禁运。这个协会反对波恩政府对中国贸易所采取的态度。这个协会认为目前有迫切需要修正对中国的禁运政策。他们说：禁运政策并不能阻止中国的经济建设，反而使中国的一个老贸易对手在争回它对中国贸易的旧有的地位上遭到困难。
