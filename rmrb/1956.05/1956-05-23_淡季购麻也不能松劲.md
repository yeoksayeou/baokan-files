Even though it is the off-season, we cannot relax our hemp purchasing efforts.

The procurement situation for raw hemp this year is not good. In the first quarter, the national acquisition of jute only completed 45% of the plan, and ramie completed 43%. The reasons for this, in addition to some areas suffering varying degrees of natural disasters last year, resulting in actual output failing to meet the expected levels, are mainly due to some comrades in the purchasing departments in certain regions having a relaxed attitude during the off-season. They are not actively delving into and ascertaining the amount of hemp in storage, not actively improving purchasing methods, and not cooperating with industrial and commercial administrative departments to strengthen market management. Some people say: the raw hemp market is nearing its end, and farmers may not have much hemp in storage. In reality, it's not that there isn't much, but rather that there is quite a lot. According to typical surveys in Shanxi Province, it is estimated that farmers' hemp storage still accounts for about 40% of the marketable quantity. In Shandong Province, many farmers still have raw hemp from two years ago. This shows that there is still hemp in storage in rural areas, and there are conditions for completing the raw hemp procurement task.

Due to the basic realization of agricultural cooperativization, the enthusiasm of farmers for production is unprecedentedly high. The spring plowing and farming season has started earlier this year, and farmers do not have time to market and sell hemp. At the same time, the material supply work and purchasing work in some areas have not been well integrated, and market management is lax. In response to this situation, purchasing departments must correspondingly change purchasing methods, cooperate with state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives, and industrial and commercial administrative departments to do a good job in material supply, and strengthen market management. Recently, purchasing departments in many areas of Hunan Province have sent people to rural areas for mobile procurement, cooperating with commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives to strengthen publicity on one hand and supply needed materials to rural areas on the other, and have acquired a considerable amount of raw hemp through the peddler model. In Muling Township, Eleventh District of Hanshou County, the original daily collection was 100 jin, but after the mobile team went to the villages for procurement, the daily collection increased to more than 1,000 jin. In Chaling County, five peddler teams were organized to go deep into the countryside, and they acquired more than 4,600 jin in two days. These examples show that as long as diverse purchasing methods are adopted in response to the new situation, and the old method of waiting for goods to come to the door is changed, it is possible to complete the raw hemp procurement task.

    淡季购麻也不能松劲
    马皆明
    今年原麻收购的情况很不好。第一季度，全国大麻仅完成收购计划的45％；苎麻完成43％。其原因，除去年部分地区遭受不同程度的自然灾害，实际产量未能达到预计水平外，主要是某些地区采购部门的同志，有淡季松劲的思想，不积极深入摸清存麻数量，不积极改进采购方法，不协同工商行政部门加强市场管理。有人说：原麻上市接近尾声，农民手里存麻可能不多了。实际上不是不多，而是相当多。据山西省典型调查推算，农民存麻尚占商品量的40％左右。山东省有不少农户还存有二年前的原麻。这说明农村还有存麻，完成采购原麻任务是有条件的。
    由于农业合作化的基本实现，农民生产积极性空前高涨。今年春耕农忙时间提前，农民无暇上市售麻。同时，有些地区物资供应工作和采购工作没有很好结合，市场管理松弛。针对这种情况，采购部门必须相应地改变采购方法，配合国营商业部门和供销合作社、工商行政管理部门，做好物资供应工作，加强市场管理。最近湖南省不少地区的采购部门，派人下乡流动收购，配合商业部门和供销合作社，通过货郎担方式，一面加强宣传，一面供应农村需要物资，收购了不少原麻。汉寿县十一区木岭乡，原来每天收一百斤，流动组深入到村收购后每天收一千多斤。茶陵县组织了五付货郎担深入农村，两天就收购了四千六百多斤。这些事例，都说明只要针对新的情况采取多种多样的采购方式，改变老一套的等货上门方法，收购原麻任务，是可能完成的。
