Editor's Note: The materials published here are sufficient to illustrate the serious one-sidedness in agricultural production in certain areas. This one-sidedness is manifested in: failing to conduct investigations and research, disregarding actual conditions, and blindly expanding the planting area of certain crops. It is also manifested in: rash actions in production arrangements, neglecting one thing while attending to another, destroying one crop to plant another, and sacrificing existing crops to obtain a certain high yield (and this high yield does not necessarily increase income). Actively expanding the area of high-yield crops is good; however, doing so must take into account the specific conditions at the time and place; at the same time, we must not one-sidedly focus on expanding high-yield crops and abandon the principle of diversified management. It is worth noting that while the occurrence of the above serious errors is extremely rare, the one-sidedness in agricultural production leadership, such as only valuing agriculture and not sideline occupations, only valuing grain and cotton and not other crops, is a bias that exists to varying degrees in many places. It should also be pointed out that this bias in agricultural production in certain areas is inseparable from the bureaucracy and subjectivism of the leadership organs in these areas. Therefore, the above issues are not only a profound lesson for the leadership organs in the places where errors have already occurred, but also a useful warning for the leadership organs in other places.

    More than 100,000 Jin of Rapeseed Lost
    Wujiang County is a key county in Jiangsu Province for promoting the planting of double-cropping rice this year. Due to the excessive target for expanding the area of double-cropping rice, the Lushu District of this county saw the phenomenon of blindly pulling out wheat and rapeseed seedlings in some townships. A total of more than 2,000 mu of rapeseed was pulled out in the whole district (of which 364 mu were replanted, but less than one-third survived), accounting for 20% of the total rapeseed in the district; hundreds of mu were also prepared to be pulled out, but were later stopped by the district committee. In this way, the area of double-cropping rice can be expanded, but the district will harvest more than 100,000 jin less of rapeseed, and the winter wheat production will also be reduced.
    The head of the Production Cooperation Department of Wujiang County Party Committee and the secretary of the Lushu District Committee were both aware of this situation, but they did not criticize and stop this error in time. The district committee secretary initially expressed his agreement.
    Why do the township staff here not cherish oil crops and wheat so much? They also have their "reasons." Zhang Shigen, the production committee member of Kuxin Township, said: "If we don't pull out the rapeseed fields, we can't complete the task of expanding double-cropping rice." An employee of the Xinxin Agricultural Production Cooperative said: "We saw that San Cun Township was pulling out rapeseed to expand the area of double-cropping rice, and we wanted to secretly compete with them. So we also mobilized the members to pull out 108 mu of rapeseed." The staff of San Cun Township, a key township of the district committee, believed that pulling out rapeseed could sell the seedlings for money, and planting double-cropping rice in the rapeseed fields would increase production and receive a bumper harvest award. They even regarded this erroneous practice as a trick and fully mobilized the masses to pull out rapeseed. However, the unfortunate consequence of using this "trick" was that the farmers in the whole township reduced their income by more than 23,700 jin of rapeseed! (Li Siyao)

    Flue-cured Tobacco, Peanuts, and Sugarcane Were Squeezed Out
    Wuming County in Guangxi Province was originally a diversified economic crop producing area. According to the plan, this year the total output value of flue-cured tobacco, peanuts, and sugarcane would be equivalent to 33% of the total grain output value of the county. However, the leading organs of this county believed that: planting grain is the most important thing, and other crops can be planted as much as possible. As a result, the area of economic crops was greatly squeezed out. For example, Qingjiang Township has a total of 3,734 mu of cultivated land. This year, the township was asked to plant 3,000 mu of early rice, 552 mu of corn, and small red rice, leaving only 182 mu to plant economic crops and vegetables. Last year, the area of flue-cured tobacco and peanuts alone was more than 850 mu, but this year they were all squeezed out by grain. Now that the sowing season is about to pass, Wuming County's economic crop planting plan has been completed very poorly. The county plans to plant 30,000 mu of flue-cured tobacco, but only 25.6% has been completed; it plans to plant 100,000 mu of peanuts, but only more than 14,000 mu have been planted.
    Squeezing out economic crops not only reduces the supply of industrial raw materials to the state, but also brings huge losses to farmers. The five townships of Hesong, Qingjiang, etc., have a total of 176 tobacco kilns. According to this year's tobacco planting area, 131 kilns will have no tobacco to bake. With fewer peanuts planted, farmers are worried about not having oil to eat. Some farmers questioned the staff: "You don't lead us to plant peanuts, and if we don't have oil to eat, what are we talking about the superiority of advanced cooperatives!" (Gui Nong)

    Miscalculated, Bamboo Cut Down
    Xiyuan Village, Yanqian Township, Changshan County, Zhejiang Province, has many bamboo mountains. Planting bamboo and selling it as fodder is an important sideline occupation for local farmers. However, in April of this year, more than 30 members of the Xiyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative cut down and burned 60 mu of bamboo in the bamboo mountains, preparing to reclaim the bamboo mountains to plant corn. The members cut down bamboo, partly because they did not understand the policy of bamboo mountains joining the cooperative, and partly because they believed that planting corn required less capital and yielded quick returns. Bamboo has good and bad years, and making paper from bamboo silk is costly. This year is also a bad year, and the harvest is small. They believed that cutting down bamboo and planting corn could yield grain in the same year. In fact, this calculation was wrong. Members such as Xu Rongshui calculated an account: these mountainous areas can yield at most 12,000 jin of corn each year; while the original bamboo produced can be sold for paper making every two years. After deducting taxes and costs, it can still buy back 75,000 jin of corn. Not only will their own income be more, but they can also increase the state's tax revenue by 5,000 yuan each year.
    Cutting down bamboo to plant corn not only reduces the actual income of the members, but also damages soil and water conservation. Some members, seeing so much bamboo being cut down, said painfully: "If we continue to do this, our green mountains will all turn into yellow mountains in a few years. Then we will have nothing to eat!" (Ling Jizhong)

    Rapeseed Turned into Fertilizer
    This year, the "Fanrong" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Songxia Town, Shangyu County, Zhejiang Province, only cares about planting rice and does not care about other crops. Recently, some production teams even cut down the nearly mature green barley in order to transplant rice seedlings earlier; the seventh production team, on the pretext that there was not enough fertilizer for rice, cut down the immature rapeseed and plowed it into the fields to be used as green manure. This practice does not greatly benefit rice production, but reduces the summer harvest of the cooperative, directly affecting the actual income of the members.

    反对农业生产中的片面性
    编者按：这里发表的几篇材料，足以说明某些地区的农业生产中有严重的片面性。这种片面性表现在：不作调查研究，不看实际条件，盲目地扩大某一种作物的种植面积。还表现在：在生产安排上轻举妄动，顾此失彼，毁掉这种作物，种上那种作物，用牺牲现有农作物的代价去换取某种高额产量（而且这种高额产量并不一定就是增加收入）。积极扩大高产作物面积，这是好的；但是，这样做必须照顾当时当地的具体条件；同时，也不能片面地抓住扩大高产作物，而把多种经营的原则抛弃了。值得注意的是，发生上述严重错误的地方固然是极少数，但是农业生产领导中的片面性，只重视农业，不重视副业；只重视粮棉，不重视别的作物，却是许多地方都程度不同地存在的偏向。还应当指出，某些地区的农业生产中的这种偏向，是同这些地区的领导机关的官僚主义和主观主义分不开的。因此，上面的问题，不仅对于已经发生错误的地方的领导机关是一个深刻的教训，而且对于其他地方的领导机关，也是一个有益的警告。
    少收油菜籽十多万斤
    吴江县是江苏省今年推行种植双季稻的重点县，由于原定的扩大双季稻面积的指标过大，这个县的芦墟区的部分乡就发生了盲目地拔掉小麦和油菜苗的现象。全区共拔掉油菜两千多亩（其中364亩虽进行了移苗补植，但是成活的不到三分之一），占全区油菜总数的20％；还有几百亩准备拔，后来被区委制止了。小麦苗也拔掉不少，有一个乡就拔掉了1，619亩。这样，双季稻的面积可以扩大了，可是全区油菜籽少收了十多万斤，冬小麦也要减产。
    这种情况，吴江县委生产合作部部长和芦墟区委书记都是知道的，但是，他们没有及早地批判和制止这种错误，区委书记最初还表示同意。
    这里的乡工作人员为什么这样不珍惜油料和小麦呢？他们也有他们的“理由”。库新乡的生产委员张师根说：“不拔掉油菜田，就不能完成扩种双季稻的任务。”莘新农业生产合作社的一个工作人员说：“我们看到三村乡拔油菜扩大双季稻的面积，想暗地和他们比赛。于是也发动社员拔掉108亩油菜。”区委重点乡——三村乡的工作人员则认为拔掉油菜，菜苗可以卖钱，菜田种双季稻，增了产还可得丰产奖。他们竟把这个错误的作法当成一个窍门，全面动员群众去拔油菜。可是他们使用了这个“窍门”的不幸后果却是：全乡农民减少了二万三千七百多斤油菜籽的收入！　（李思尧）
    烤烟、花生、甘蔗被挤垮了
    广西省武鸣县原是一个多种经济作物产区，按照计划，今年全县烤烟、花生、甘蔗三项作物的总产值就相当于全县粮食总产值的33％。但是这个县的领导机关认为：种粮食最要紧，别的作物能种多少算多少。于是，经济作物的面积就被大量地挤掉了。如清江乡共有耕田3，734亩，今年要这个乡种三千亩早稻、552亩玉米和小红米，只剩下182亩种经济作物和蔬菜。去年这个乡光烤烟和花生的面积就有850多亩，今年都被粮食挤掉了。现在播种季节快要过去了，武鸣县的经济作物种植计划却完成得很差。全县计划种三万亩烤烟，才完成25.6％；计划种十万亩花生，才种了一万四千多亩。
    挤掉了经济作物，不但减少了供应给国家的工业原料，也给农民带来巨大的损失。鹤耸、清江等五个乡共有176个烤房，按今年的种烟面积计算，将有131个烤房没有烟烤。花生种少了，农民都担心没有油吃，有的农民去质问工作人员：“你们不领导种花生，没有油吃，还谈什么高级社的优越性！”　（桂农）
    打错了算盘，砍掉了毛竹
    浙江省常山县岩前乡西沅村有很多竹山，种毛竹做草料卖，是当地农民的一项重要副业。可是今年四月里，西沅农业生产合作社有三十多个社员把六十亩竹山的毛竹砍掉、烧掉了，他们准备把竹山开垦出来种玉米。社员们砍掉毛竹，一方面是由于对竹山入社的政策不了解，一方面是认为种玉米本钱小、收益快。毛竹有大年小年之分，破竹丝做纸料，费的工本大，今年又逢着小年，收得少。他们认为砍掉毛竹种玉米，当年就能收到粮食。实际上这个算盘是打错了。社员徐荣水等算了一笔账：这些山地种玉米，每年最多能收一万二千斤；而原来所产的毛竹，每两年卖纸料的钱，除去交税和工本，还可买回七万五千斤玉米，不但自己收入多，每年还能给国家增加五千元的税收。
    砍掉毛竹种玉米，不但社员自己减少实际收入，还破坏了水土保持。有的社员看到砍了那么多毛竹，痛心地说：“像这样办下去，不用几年，我们这里的青山就要全部变黄山了，到那时就要喝西北风去！”（凌济忠）
    油菜变成了肥料
    浙江省上虞县崧厦镇“繁荣”农业生产合作社今年只顾种水稻，对别的作物就不管了。最近有的生产队为了提早插秧，竟把快要成熟的青大麦割掉；第七生产队借口水稻肥料不够，又把没有成熟的油菜割掉，耕入田内沤肥。这种做法，对水稻增产并没有多大的好处，却使得社里夏季收成减少了，直接影响到社员的实际收入。
