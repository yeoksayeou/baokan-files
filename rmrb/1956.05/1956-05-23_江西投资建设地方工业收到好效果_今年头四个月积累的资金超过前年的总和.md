Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 22nd – Jiangxi Province's local industries accumulated more capital for the state in the first four months of this year than in the entire year of 1954. In 1955, the capital accumulated by local industries increased by more than double compared to 1953.

In recent years, the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Industry has newly built and expanded a total of twenty-six directly affiliated factories and mines, mainly light industry factories. The newly built Jiangxi Textile Factory, which fully commenced production in October 1954, has already reduced the cost of yarn and cloth by 15% to 22%. By the end of this year, the factory's capital construction investment can be fully recovered. The expanded Zhonglian Cigarette Factory accumulated enough capital for the state in 1955 alone to build five factories of the same scale. The cost of Zhonglian Cigarette Factory's main product, the "Blue Pacific" cigarette, has also been greatly reduced, and the workers have also improved the product quality based on the opinions of the main sales target - farmers. The Jiangxi Printing Company and the Jiangxi Chemical Factory accumulated funds for the state due to cost reductions last year, which is equivalent to three times the total amount of funds accumulated in 1953.

    江西投资建设地方工业收到好效果
    今年头四个月积累的资金超过前年的总和
    新华社南昌22日电　江西省地方工业今年头四个月为国家积累的资金，已经超过了1954年全年的总和。1955年，地方工业积累的资金，比1953年增加了一倍多。
    几年来，江西省工业厅新建和扩建的直属厂矿共有二十六个，其中主要是一些轻工业工厂。1954年10月份全面投入生产的新建江西纺织厂，纱、布的成本已经降低了15％到22％。到今年年底，这个工厂的基本建设投资就可以全部收回来。经过扩建的中联烟厂，仅在1955年给国家积累的资金就可以建设五个同样规模的工厂。中联烟厂的主要产品——“蓝太平”香烟的成本也降低了很多，工人们并且根据主要销售对象——农民的意见提高了产品质量。江西印刷公司和江西化工厂去年由于成本降低而给国家积累的资金，就相当于1953年积累资金总数的三倍。
