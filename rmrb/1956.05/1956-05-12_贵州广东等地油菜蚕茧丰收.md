Rapeseed and Silkworm Cocoon Harvests in Guizhou, Guangdong and Other Places

The more than 3.3 million mu of rapeseed in Guizhou, which has dyed the mountains and fields of Guizhou in patches of orange-yellow, has generally begun to be harvested. In some areas of Xingyi, Yanhe, Puan and other counties, where more rapeseed is planted, the harvest is 30% to 40% higher than last year.

This year, the rapeseed harvesting area in Guizhou Province has expanded by more than 33% compared with 1955. Since the beginning of spring, agricultural producers' cooperatives in various parts of Guizhou Province have strengthened the field management of rapeseed, generally carried out weeding and top dressing, ensuring this year's rapeseed harvest.

The rapeseed harvest in Jiangxi Province has generally been completed. The total output of rapeseed in the province this year has increased from 140 million jin last year to 200 million jin, an increase of more than 40% compared with last year.

In addition to the expansion of the rapeseed harvesting area by 670,000 mu in Jiangxi Province this year compared with last year, the average yield per mu has also increased from 46 jin last year to 53.5 jin. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

Guangdong Province's first batch of spring silkworm white cocoons has generally achieved a bumper harvest. According to preliminary statistics, all 43,000 silkworm egg sheets produced an average of more than 40 jin of cocoons per sheet, an increase of about 20% compared with the same period last year. This spring, silkworm farmers in the Pearl River Delta have achieved unprecedented harvests due to the widespread adoption of advanced seedling raising techniques. The 80 silkworm egg sheets of the No. 1 Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Xijiao Township, Shunde County, produced an average of 64 jin of cocoons per sheet, an increase of 33% compared with last year. Among them, 23 sheets produced an average of 75 jin of cocoons per sheet, breaking the province's highest record set by the cooperative last year.

    贵州广东等地油菜蚕茧丰收
    把贵州山野染得片片橙黄的三百三十多万亩油菜，已经普遍开始收割。种植油菜较多的兴义、沿河、普安等县的部分地区，收获量比去年高30％到40％。
    贵州省今年油菜收获面积比1955年扩大了33％以上。入春以来，贵州省各地农业生产合作社都加强了油菜的田间管理工作，普遍进行了除草和施追肥，保证了今年的油菜丰收。
    江西省油菜已经大体收割完毕。全省今年油菜籽总产量由去年的一亿四千万斤上升到二亿斤，比去年增产40％以上。
    江西省今年油菜籽除收获面积比去年扩大了六十七万亩以外，每亩平均产量也由去年的四十六斤上升到了五十三斤半。　（据新华社讯）
    广东省第一造春蚕白茧普遍获得丰收。初步统计，全部四万三千张蚕种，每单张产茧平均达四十斤以上。比去年同期增产两成左右。今春珠江三角洲的蚕农们由于普遍采用先进的养苗技术，因而获得过去未有的丰收。顺德县细滘乡第一农业生产合作社的八十张蚕种，平均每单张产茧六十四斤，比去年增产三成三，其中有二十三张平均每单张产茧七十五斤，突破了去年这个社创造的全省最高纪录。
