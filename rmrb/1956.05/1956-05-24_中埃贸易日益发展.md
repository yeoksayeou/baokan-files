Up to now, the total value of import and export transactions between the two sides has reached about 15 million pounds.

Currently, China's various specialized companies are continuing to negotiate transactions with Egyptian government trade departments and business circles. It is expected that the first agreement year protocol of the Sino-Egyptian trade agreement will be successfully completed before August this year.

    中埃贸易日益发展
    新华社23日讯　自从1955年8月中埃两国贸易协定签订以来，中国和埃及两国之间的贸易有了很大发展。到目前止，双方进出口成交金额已达一千五百万英镑左右，中国向埃及输出总值计有六百多万英镑，埃及向中国输出总值计有八百多万英镑。
    中国向埃及购买了大批棉花和棉纱。埃及向中国购买的货物有数十种，较大宗的是钢材、烟叶、茶叶、生丝、胶合板、纸张、棉籽油等。在今年三、四月间中国贸易访问团赴埃及访问期间，中国向埃及输出了织布机、细纱机、梭子等许多过去没有向埃及输出过的商品。
    目前中国的各个专业公司正继续同埃及政府贸易部门及工商界洽谈交易。预计在今年八月以前，中埃两国贸易协定的第一个协定年度议定书将能圆满地完成。
