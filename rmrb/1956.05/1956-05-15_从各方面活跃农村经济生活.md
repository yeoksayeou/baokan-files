    Invigorate Rural Economic Life in All Aspects
    By our reporter Ji Xichen
    Since the beginning of spring, farmers in many parts of Sichuan have been reporting: they are short on cash and have no money to spend. Some farmers, in order to obtain small amounts of pocket money, have even sold small farm tools, trees, and piglets. In some areas, there has been a phenomenon of poor currency circulation. In Yibin Prefecture alone, currency withdrawal exceeded injection by more than 2.2 million yuan. Therefore, taking measures in all aspects to rapidly change this abnormal phenomenon in rural economic life is a pressing and important task at present.

    Cannot Neglect Sideline Production
    Many facts show that after the great development of agricultural production cooperatives, the sideline income of farmers has sharply decreased. According to a survey of agricultural cooperatives in four townships, including Sanhe and Fuhe in Changshou County, the income of agricultural cooperative members from raising poultry and livestock this spring decreased by 16%-30% compared with after last autumn, the income from minor local specialties decreased by 69%, and the income from household handicrafts decreased by 34.8%. The decrease in sideline income is mainly due to the fact that some cadres only pay attention to agricultural production and relax their leadership over sideline production. Many cooperatives do not have plans to develop sideline production, and some cooperatives' sideline production plans are not realistic, or only have abstract indicators without specific measures. For example, many cooperatives have generally failed to complete their plans to develop pig farming because they have not specifically solved the problem of sows and pig feed. Some cooperatives set the work points for sideline labor low, and all the money earned by members from selling sideline products must be turned over to the cooperative for unified management.

    Recently, according to the instructions of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and in accordance with the principles of adapting to local conditions and acting according to one's ability, various localities have actively arranged the sideline production of cooperatives. In Luzhou Prefecture, where the number of pigs decreased by 25% compared with the same period in 1955, counties generally held meetings to discuss the development of sideline production. More than 6,000 agricultural cooperatives in Longchang, Fushun, Hejiang, and other counties have revised their development plans for sideline production and assigned personnel specifically responsible for sideline production. After taking measures to breed and raise pigs, develop pig sources, establish feed bases, and feed processing plants, the number of pigs in the entire region increased by 10% in one month. The "Dongfanghong" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Rongchang County, while developing publicly owned pigs, also helped members overcome difficulties such as feed for personal pig raising, and planned to increase the number of pigs raised by members individually from 120 to 600, with an average of three and a half pigs per household. Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinfan County sought various avenues for sideline production. The public operation of brick kilns, flour mills, processing rice, and raising pigs alone can generate a net income of more than 40,000 yuan, with an average income of more than 60 yuan per household.

    Implement Diversified Operations, Adapting to Local Conditions
    The production of cash crops and local specialties is an important source of income for farmers in many areas. However, some places have neglected the production of some economic and technical crops and local specialties because they have not implemented the policy of diversified operations. This not only affects the purchase of export goods and some industrial raw materials, but also reduces the income of farmers. In the scattered ramie producing areas of Gusong and Gongxian counties, the planting area and yield of ramie have generally shrunk by five or six times. In Niufu District, Fushun County, six townships have dug up ramie roots that have been growing for many years. In many tea-producing areas, a large amount of tea that should have been picked has not been picked because the cooperatives have not properly arranged the tea farmers' picking time and organized the labor force for tea picking. After expanding the spring harvest crops in the suburbs of Yibin City, the planting area of the local specialty, Ya Cai (芽菜), was greatly reduced. Jihe Township lost more than 200,000 jin of kohlrabi and Ya Cai alone, and each farmer in the township earned an average of more than 100 yuan less in income. These losses cannot be compensated even if grain crops are increased several times. Therefore, actively restoring the production of certain cash crops has also become an important aspect of increasing members' income and invigorating rural economic life. Huangtongping Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Yibin City adhered to the policy of diversified operations and actively developed animal husbandry and the production of other cash crops. They increased the planting of cash crops such as cattails and wild rice stems in more than 80 mu of lakes and marshes, which alone increased cash income by 10,000 yuan. Including other sideline occupations, each member household received an average benefit of more than 200 yuan.

    Timely Purchase of Local Specialties
    Actively developing the purchase of agricultural and sideline products, local specialties, and handicraft sideline products is particularly important for invigorating rural economic life. However, commercial departments have done a very poor job in this regard. Some commercial workers, under the control of capitalist business ideas, are not actively purchasing agricultural and sideline products and local specialties, or are taking the approach of suppressing grades and prices in the purchase. Pingwu County produces more than 450 kinds of medicinal materials and other local specialties, but because the purchasing departments find it troublesome, scattered, and unprofitable, they now only purchase more than 110 kinds. In Anxian County, the general lowering of tea grades and the complicated acceptance procedures have caused dissatisfaction among the masses. Some said: "The grade is inspected as inferior, and it takes a long time to get the money. It takes more than half a day to sell a pound of tea." Some tea farmers were so angry that they cut down the tea trees and planted corn instead. This situation is now changing. According to the changes in the needs for goods after cooperativization, all localities are proactively carrying out the purchase and pre-purchase of agricultural and sideline products and local specialties. In the whole province, farmers have received more than 13.5 million yuan in deposits for pre-purchasing cotton, tea, flue-cured tobacco, and hemp alone. Tongnan County widely organized private merchants and peddlers to purchase medicinal materials and sporadic local specialties and transport poultry, livestock, seeds, and other means of production through the signing of combined contracts. The circulation of commodities, which was originally in a state of stagnation, is now reactivated.

    Quickly Grant Loans to Farmers
    To invigorate rural economic life, it is also necessary to properly arrange rural funds. Banks should quickly lend the funds stipulated for cooperatives and farmers outside the cooperatives so that poor farmers can get loans to solve their production and living difficulties in a timely manner. In addition, the income distribution system of cooperatives should be gradually improved. At present, cooperatives generally only distribute after the autumn and summer harvests each year, which obviously cannot meet the needs of members' daily economic life. In addition to implementing advances and borrowings according to the production season, cooperatives should also implement a multiple dividend system if conditions permit. Gaoli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tianchi Township, Yibin County, distributes once a month, which not only improves the lives of the members, but also makes everyone more concerned about the cooperative's production and income.

    从各方面活跃农村经济生活
    本报记者　纪希晨
    入春以来，四川不少地方的农民反映：手头紧，没钱花。有的农民为了换取日常零用钱，甚至把小农具、树木、小猪也卖掉了。部分地区发生了货币流通不畅的现象，仅宜宾专区的货币回笼就比投放超出二百二十万元以上。因此，从各方面采取措施，迅速改变农村经济生活的这种不正常的现象，是当前一件迫切的重要的任务。
    不能忽视副业生产
    许多事实表明，在农业生产合作社大发展以后，农民的副业收入急剧地减少了。据长寿县三合、傅河等四个乡的农业合作社调查，今春农业生产合作社社员饲养家禽家畜的收入比去年秋后减少16％—30％，小宗土特产收入减少69％，家庭手工业收入减少34.8％。副业收入的减少主要是由于一部分干部只注重农业生产，放松了对副业生产的领导。许多社没有订发展副业的计划，有些社订的副业生产计划不切合实际，或者只有抽象的指标，没有具体措施。例如，许多社都因为没有具体解决母猪和猪饲料的问题，普遍没有完成发展猪只的计划。有些合作社把副业劳动的工分评得低，社员卖副业产品收入的钱也要全部收归社内统一处理。
    最近各地根据中共四川省委的指示，依照因地制宜、量力而行的原则，积极地安排了合作社的副业生产。猪只比1955年同期减少了25％的泸州专区各县，普遍召开了讨论发展副业的会议，隆昌、富顺、合江等六千多个农业社，都重新修订了发展副业生产规划，配备了专门负责副业生产的人员。在采取自繁自养、发展猪源、建立饲料基地和饲料加工厂的措施以后，全区猪只一个月就增加了10％。荣昌县“东方红”农业生产合作社，在发展公有猪的同时，还帮助社员克服了个人养猪的饲料等困难，计划把社员个人养猪的数量由一百二十只增加到六百只，每户平均喂猪三只半。新繁县新民农业生产合作社从多方面寻找副业生产门路，仅公共经营砖瓦窑、粉房、加工谷子和养猪四项，就可有净收入四万多元，每户平均收入六十多元。
  因地制宜，实行多种经营
    经济作物和土特产品的生产是许多地区农民收入的重要来源。但是，有些地方由于没有贯彻执行多种经营的方针，忽略了部分经济技术作物和土特产品的生产。这不仅影响了出口物资和部分工业原料的收购，也使农民的收入减少。古宋、珙县等苎麻分散产区，苎麻的种植面积和产量普遍缩减了五、六倍，富顺县牛佛区有六个乡都把多年生长的苎麻根蔸挖掉了。在许多产茶区里，因为合作社没有妥善安排茶农的采茶时间，组织采茶的劳动力，以致大量的应该采摘的茶没有采下来。宜宾市郊在扩大小春作物后，大量挤掉了当地特产芽菜的栽培面积。嘉禾乡仅因大头菜、芽菜减产二十多万斤，全乡每个农户就平均少得一百多元的收入。而这些损失即使粮食作物增产数倍也是无法补偿的。因此，积极恢复某些经济作物的生产，也成为增加社员收入、活跃农村经济生活的一个重要方面。宜宾市郊黄桶坪农业生产合作社坚持多种经营的方针，积极发展了畜牧及其他经济作物的生产。他们曾在八十多亩湖沼地里，增种了蒲草、茭荀等经济作物，仅此一项就增加了一万元的现金收入，连其他副业在内，每户社员平均得到二百多元的收益。
    及时收购土特产品
    积极开展农副业产品、土特产品和手工副业产品的收购工作，对活跃农村经济生活特别重要。但是，商业部门在这方面做得很差。有些商业工作人员在资本主义经营思想支配下，对农副业产品和土特产品，不积极收购，或者在收购中采取压级压价的作法。平武县出产的四百五十多种药材和其他土特产品，因为收购部门嫌麻烦、分散、利小，现在只收购了一百一十多种。安县由于茶叶普遍压低等级，验收手续繁多，引起群众的不满。有的说：“验级是下等，取钱得久等，卖上一斤茶，等上半天多。”有的茶农气愤得把茶树砍掉，改种上玉米。这种情况现在正在改变。各地根据合作化后对商品需要的变化，主动展开农副业产品和土特产品的收购、预购工作。全省仅预购棉花、茶叶、烤烟、麻类，农民得到的定金就达到一千三百五十万元多。潼南县通过签订结合合同，广泛组织私商小贩收购药材和零星土特产品，贩运家禽家畜、种子及其他生产资料，原来处于某种停滞状态的商品流转现在重新活跃起来了。
    迅速把贷款贷给农民
    活跃农村经济生活，还必须妥善安排农村资金。银行应该把规定贷给合作社的和社外农民的款项迅速贷放下去，使贫困农民及时得到解决生产、生活困难的贷款。此外，合作社的收益分配制度，应该逐步改进。目前一般的社一年中仅在秋收、夏收以后才分配，这显然不能满足社员的日常经济生活的需要。合作社除应按生产季节实行预支、借支外，如果条件许可，还应该实行多次分红制。宜宾县天池乡高梨农业生产合作社每月预分一次，既改善了社员的生活，也使大家更加关心社的生产和收入。
