    Properly Arrange Elderly and Infirm Commune Members
    The Huoba Agricultural Cooperative in Dingnan Township, Guiding County, Guizhou Province, has twenty-two households, totaling thirty-five elderly, infirm, and disabled members. Among them are fifteen people over sixty years old, five cripples, three blind people, and three orphans. After the cooperative transitioned into an advanced cooperative, some elderly, infirm, and disabled members worried about their future livelihoods and felt uneasy. Some, upon hearing that the cooperative would take care of them, mistakenly believed that they could just wait to be fed and didn't need to do any work. Some staff members also found them troublesome and didn't assign them tasks they could handle, causing dissatisfaction among other cooperative members.

    In response to these concerns, the Huoba Agricultural Cooperative Party Branch conducted a survey of the elderly, widowed, orphaned, and disabled members and found that only three of the thirty-five were truly unable to do any work. This fact made the cooperative cadres realize that not assigning them work was a significant waste. Therefore, the cooperative made comprehensive arrangements based on their physical strength, special skills, and the needs of production. For example, the elderly Luo Guangming had production experience but had difficulty climbing slopes, so he was assigned a plot of land near his house to plant tobacco and corn; Feng Tangshi, in her fifties and unable to do fieldwork, was assigned to collect manure; the elderly woman Chen Luoshi, who was clean and good-natured, was assigned to look after five children; the eldest of the three orphans looked after the cattle, while the younger ones collected manure. Through careful planning and proper arrangements, all the elderly and disabled cooperative members who could work were given suitable jobs, greatly boosting their enthusiasm for production, and other cooperative members were also satisfied.

    妥善安排老弱社员
    贵州省贵定县定南乡火把农业合作社，有老弱残疾的社员二十二户，三十五人。其中六十岁以上的十五人、跛子五人、瞎子三人、孤儿三人。这个社转成高级社以后，有些老弱残疾的社员怕以后生活无着，思想不安。有的听到合作社里要把他们包下来，就错误地认为等着吃就行了，什么活也不用做了。有的工作人员也嫌他们麻烦，他们能做的活，也不分配他们去做，引起其他社员的不满。
    火把农业合作社党支部根据这些思想反映，对鳏寡孤独老弱残疾的社员进行了排队，发现这三十五个人中，真正什么活也不能干的只有三人。这个事实，使社干部认识到不分配他们做活是一个很大的浪费。于是，社里就按照他们的体力、特长和生产的需要，分别进行了全面安排。例如老人罗光明有生产经验，但爬坡困难，就把他房子跟前的一块土包给他栽烤烟、种玉米；不能做田土活的五十多岁的冯唐氏，就分配她拣粪；老年妇女陈罗氏爱干净、性情好，分配她看了五个娃娃；三个孤儿，大的看牛，小的拣粪。经过周密计划和妥善安排，老弱残疾社员能干活的都有了合适的活干，生产情绪很高，别的社员也都感到满意。
