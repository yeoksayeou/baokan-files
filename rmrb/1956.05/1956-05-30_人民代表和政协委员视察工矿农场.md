Xinhua News Agency, May 29th: National People's Congress representatives and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference are inspecting factories, mines, farms, and agricultural cooperatives in various locations.

　　Representatives and members Wang Yunsheng, Wu Jingchao, and twenty others inspected industrial production, capital construction, and the living welfare of steelworkers in Anshan. During the inspection, the director of the steel plant discussed the increase in steel production this year compared to the highest pre-liberation annual output, and also told them that labor productivity had doubled in five years. The material and cultural life of the workers has also improved. Writer Ai Wu, who lived in the steel plant for over a year, said: "What I see today is very different from what I saw three years ago. Many foremen and furnace chiefs are workers, which shows that the workers have mastered the technology." The representatives and members also raised opinions and suggestions on the problems existing in production. Wu Jingchao, professor at the Chinese People's University, pointed out that there are some imbalances in some production processes in Anshan Iron and Steel, which prevents some equipment from realizing its potential and further increasing output. He also suggested that when summarizing advanced experience, attention should be paid to summarizing the advanced experience of an enterprise or a production unit. For example, the average effective utilization coefficient of the volume of No. 4 blast furnace reached a very advanced level last month, and their experience should be summarized and promoted.

　　Representatives and members Ding Guitang, Li Yong, Wang Jiazhen and others recently inspected the state-owned Friendship Farm on the border. They paid special attention to understanding the farm's learning of advanced Soviet experience, the living conditions of employees, and the farm's medical equipment. They also visited the Soviet experts who are consultants to the farm, expressed their condolences and gratitude to them, and had a get-together with them to watch a movie recording the farm's construction process.

　　Representatives and members Wang Weizhou, Yang Mingxuan, Wei Lihuang, and six others inspected work in Hohhot and Baotou City in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Li Peizhi and five others learned in detail about the socialist competition and the welfare of employees in the Hohhot Local State-Owned Woolen Mill and the State-Owned Licorice Paste Factory, and put forward methods to improve the packaging of licorice paste in the State-Owned Licorice Paste Factory. The representatives and members also inspected the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Hohhot and held a forum with the members.

    人民代表和政协委员视察工矿农场
    新华社29日讯　全国人民代表大会代表和中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会委员在各地视察工厂、矿山和农场、农业社。
    代表和委员王芸生、吴景超等二十二人，在鞍山视察了工业生产、基本建设和钢铁工人生活福利的情况。在视察的时候，炼钢厂厂长谈到炼钢厂今年钢的产量比解放前最高年产量增长的情况，还告诉他们，劳动生产率在五年中就提高了两倍。工人的物质和文化生活也提高了。曾经在炼钢厂住过一年多的作家艾芜说：今天我所见到的情况和三年前已大不相同了，很多工长、炉长都是工人，这说明工人已掌握了技术。对生产中存在的问题，代表和委员们也提出了意见和建议。中国人民大学教授吴景超指出，鞍钢有些生产过程中有不平衡的现象，因而使有些设备潜力不能发挥，产量不能进一步提高；他还建议在总结先进经验的时候，要注意总结一个企业或一个生产单位的先进经验，如四号炼铁炉上月的容积平均有效利用系数达到了很先进的水平，他们的经验应该总结和推广。
    代表和委员丁贵堂、李永、王家桢等人最近视察了边疆上的国营友谊农场。他们特别注意地了解了农场学习苏联先进经验、职工生活和农场的医疗设备等情况。他们还曾拜访农场顾问苏联专家，向他们表示慰问和感谢，并且同他们一起联欢，看了记录农场建场经过的电影。
    代表和委员王维舟、杨明轩、卫立煌等九人，在内蒙古自治区呼和浩特和包头市视察了工作。李培芝等六人详细地了解了呼和浩特市地方国营毛织厂和国营甘草膏厂开展社会主义竞赛和职工生活福利的情况，并且对国营甘草膏厂提出改进包装甘草膏的办法。代表和委员们还视察了呼和浩特市郊区红星农业生产合作社，同社员们举行了座谈会。
