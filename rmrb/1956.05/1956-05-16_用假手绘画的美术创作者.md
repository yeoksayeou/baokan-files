    An oil painting, "Glorious Advanced Worker," was hung at the First Heilongjiang Province Workers' Amateur Art Creation Exhibition, arousing widespread interest among visitors.

    The author of this painting is Dai Shutian, an art creator who paints with artificial hands.

    Dai Shutian is currently an employee of the state-owned Jianhua Company in Qiqihar City. In 1950, an explosion occurred during a factory chemical experiment, and both of his wrists were severed. After he recovered, he had two artificial hands installed and insisted on practicing writing. In the first few months, his hands often became inflamed and painful due to excessive fatigue, and his artificial hands were not flexible in moving. He used his left artificial hand to support his right artificial hand, writing stroke by stroke. After about half a year of practice, he finally learned to write.

    Dai Shutian soon became interested in painting and, with the help of art workers, learned to paint.

    Since 1953, Dai Shutian has been responsible for the work of the Production Technology Propaganda Group of the company's cultural palace. Since last year, in cooperation with other group members, he has painted more than 560 comic strips, more than 150 slogan signs, and published more than 200 issues of blackboard newspapers.

    用假手绘画的美术创作者
    一幅“光荣的先进工作者”的油画挂在黑龙江省第一届职工业余美术创作展览会上，引起了参观者的普遍兴趣。
    这幅画的作者是一个用假手绘画的美术创作者戴书田。
    戴书田现在是齐齐哈尔市国营建华公司的职员。他在1950年，在一个工厂化学试验中发生爆炸，两只手腕被炸断。他在健康恢复后，安上了两只假手，坚持写字锻炼。开始几个月因过于疲劳，两手经常发炎发痛，假手移转总不灵活。他用左假手托住右假手一笔一画地写，经过半年左右的锻炼，最后学会了写字。
    戴书田很快又对绘画发生了兴趣，并且在美术工作人员的帮助下，学会了绘画。
    从1953年开始，戴书田负责这个公司的文化宫生产技术宣传组的工作。去年起他在其他组员合作下，共画了五百六十多幅连环画、一百五十多块标语牌、出版了二百多次黑板报。（新华社）
