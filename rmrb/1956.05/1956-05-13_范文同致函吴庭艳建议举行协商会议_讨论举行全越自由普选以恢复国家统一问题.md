    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 12th: Pham Van Dong, Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, sent a letter to Ngo Dinh Diem, President of the Republic of Vietnam, on May 11th, suggesting that, in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords, representatives of the governments of both regions hold a consultative conference at a location on Vietnamese territory agreed upon by both parties, to discuss the holding of free general elections throughout the country to restore the unity of Vietnam.

    According to Pham Van Dong's suggestion, the general elections should be held simultaneously throughout the country to elect a single National Assembly. This National Assembly should appoint a joint national government. The basic principle of the general elections is: to hold free general elections throughout the country using universal, equal, direct, and secret ballots. All issues related to holding and supervising the general elections should be decided by both parties based on mutual agreement.

    Pham Van Dong said that Vietnam is a unified country, the Vietnamese people are a unified nation, the North and the South belong to the same family, they have the same bloodline, and they are indivisible. All of our compatriots most strongly hope that our motherland will be reunited through free, nationwide elections. I hope that the government of the Republic of Vietnam will not disappoint the wishes of our compatriots, respond to the call of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, and immediately appoint representatives to hold consultations with representatives of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to discuss the issue of holding nationwide free general elections to reunify Vietnam.

    Pham Van Dong finally expressed his expectation of receiving a reply from the government of the Republic of Vietnam.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 12th: The Vietnamese "People's Daily" said in a commentary published today that the talks between the representatives of the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference have achieved results that are conducive to the continued implementation of the Geneva Accords and the maintenance of peace in Indochina. The Vietnamese people welcome the efforts of the two chairmen.

    The commentary emphasized that in order to continue to thoroughly implement all the provisions of the Geneva Accords and to correctly implement the spirit of the three letters issued by the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, all responsible parties must strictly continue to fulfill their tasks. The commentary further pointed out that the current urgent matter is to ensure that the various institutions that guarantee the supervision of the implementation of the agreements can function normally; the biggest and most crucial issue is that the two regions of Vietnam must consult with each other in order to discuss the issue of unifying the country through general elections.

    The commentary said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has consistently and correctly implemented the Geneva Accords, and in the future, it and the Vietnamese people will resolutely struggle to ensure that the Geneva Accords are thoroughly implemented.

    范文同致函吴庭艳建议举行协商会议
    讨论举行全越自由普选以恢复国家统一问题
    新华社河内12日电　越南民主共和国总理范文同在五月十一日致函越南共和国总统吴庭艳，建议按照日内瓦协议的规定，双方地区政府的代表在越南领土上双方一致同意的地方举行协商会议，来讨论举行全国自由普选以恢复越南统一的问题。
    根据范文同的建议，普选应在全国各地同时举行，选出单一的国民议会。这个国民议会应任命一个全国的联合政府。普选的基本原则是：用普遍、平等、直接和秘密的投票方式举行全国自由普选。同举行和监督普选有关的一切问题应由双方根据共同协议作出决定。
    范文同说，越南是一个统一的国家，越南人民是一个统一的民族，北方和南方属于同一个家庭，他们有着同一的血统，他们是不可分割的。我们全体同胞最强烈地希望我们祖国通过自由的、全国范围的选举而重新统一。我希望越南共和国政府将不辜负我国同胞的愿望，响应日内瓦会议两位主席的呼吁，立即指派代表和越南民主共和国政府的代表举行协商，讨论举行重新统一越南的全国自由普选的问题。
    范文同最后表示期望得到越南共和国政府的答复。
    新华社河内12日电　越南“人民报”在今天发表的评论中说，日内瓦会议两位主席的代表的会谈，已经取得了有利于继续履行日内瓦协定和维护印度支那和平的成果。越南人民欢迎两位主席的努力。
    评论强调说，为了使日内瓦协定的一切条款得以继续彻底履行和为了正确地执行日内瓦会议两位主席发出的三封信件的精神，有关负责各方必须严格地继续完成自己的任务。评论进一步指出，目前的迫切的事情是必须使保证监督协定的履行的各个机构得以正常进行活动；最大和关键的问题是越南两个地区必须互相协商，以便讨论通过普选来统一国家的问题。
    评论说，越南民主共和国政府一贯正确地履行日内瓦协定，今后它和越南人民还要坚决进行斗争，使日内瓦协定得以彻底履行。
