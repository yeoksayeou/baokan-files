Frequently Reflecting the Opinions of Advanced Producers
钟怀

Now, many newspapers are using a great deal of space and prominent positions to report on the creative labor of advanced producers, introducing their achievements and victories on various fronts. Some newspapers not only widely publicize the advanced deeds and advanced thinking of advanced producers, but also pay attention to reflecting the opinions and demands of advanced producers in various ways, which is very commendable.

When Jiangxi Province convened its first industrial advanced producers' representative conference, Jiangxi Daily used a lot of space to publish many opinions of the representatives attending the conference three times in succession under the title "Opinions of Industrial Advanced Producers." Guangxi Daily once invited some representatives attending the Guangxi Provincial Industrial and Transportation Advanced Producers' Representative Conference to hold a forum, and brought their opinions and demands to the readers of the newspaper. During the National Advanced Producers' Representative Conference, China Youth Daily sent reporters to interview some advanced producers, and conveyed the opinions of the advanced producers in the newspaper after the interviews.

The opinions of advanced producers raise many noteworthy issues in the current industrial production upsurge and the advanced producers' movement.

The opinions of advanced producers published in Jiangxi Daily reflect that many factories and mines do not fully mobilize the masses, paying attention only to major types of work and not to auxiliary types of work; paying attention only to production workers and not to enterprise management personnel and engineering and technical personnel; and the work of helping backward workers catch up with advanced workers is done very poorly. For example, some mines only focus on pneumatic drillers and do not mobilize blasters and transport workers; some construction enterprises, although they attach importance to mobilizing masons and carpenters, pay little attention to technicians and plastering, painting, and other types of work. As a result, many units, despite the constant emergence of new records, do not complete the state plan very well.

Some advanced producers from Guilin Postal and Telecommunications Bureau and other units exposed the bureaucratic tendencies of some enterprise leaders in Guangxi Daily. Liu Guozhen of the Guilin Postal and Telecommunications Bureau said that a telegraph operator in their unit had not made a single mistake in a year, which was a remarkable achievement for their unit, but the leaders of the bureau looked down on this experience and did not summarize and promote it well. Similarly, the Nanning Postal and Telecommunications Bureau had not summarized the advanced experience of workers for a long time, and the promotion of advanced experiences that were effective throughout the country was also not done very well. Liu Xiaosu, an advanced producer of the Nanning Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, used the words "self-generation, self-growth, self-destruction" to describe the experiences of advanced producers and their experience in their unit.

From the articles "Wang Chonglun is Busy with Meetings," "When Will Luo Lie Fang Be Able to Get on the Ship," and "'Forest Doctor' is Very Worried..." published in China Youth Daily, it can be seen that too many meetings and social activities have become a heavy burden for advanced producers. "Let me give you an account," Wang Chonglun told the newspaper reporter, because he had to participate in various meetings and visiting groups, he "only worked for more than seventy days in 1954; before being promoted to deputy director of the workshop in January of 1955, he basically did not work." Just as Wang Chonglun said, "White hats cannot lead the production of the entire workshop," therefore, advanced producers urgently demand more time to actually participate in production and work, and to quickly improve their skills and technology, so as to make greater contributions to socialist construction.

The issues raised by advanced producers to the newspapers are extremely broad. They not only raised some urgent problems in the current production, but also reflected some important problems in the lives of the masses, such as some enterprises not seriously implementing the principle of distribution according to work in wage work; some enterprises having untimely, unreasonable, and incomplete shortcomings in the reward system; and some enterprises being indifferent to the lives of workers, running the cafeteria very poorly, and workers often not being able to eat hot meals and dishes.

While exposing problems in their work and criticizing shortcomings in their work, advanced producers often put forward suggestions for improving work. In Jiangxi Daily, we once read a suggestion to carry out business competitions among enterprise office staff. This suggestion included four specific contents and was proposed by advanced producer Liu Shiming in response to the shortcoming that the office staff of many enterprises were not fully mobilized in labor competitions. We also read the suggestion of Chen Yixian, an advanced producer in the construction industry. Based on the poor coordination between masons and auxiliary workers in the construction industry, he put forward useful opinions based on his own experience on how masons can actively obtain the cooperation of auxiliary workers and jointly complete the plan.

Advanced producers are the pioneers and core of the people, and an important link between the state and the people. They can keenly discover problems in production and work, put forward sharp criticisms and valuable suggestions; they can accurately express the demands of the masses, and influence the masses with their words and actions. "Without advanced producers, there can be no completely correct leadership." (Liu Shaoqi's congratulatory speech on behalf of the CPC Central Committee at the National Advanced Producers' Representative Conference) Frequently reflecting the opinions of advanced producers in newspapers is undoubtedly of great benefit to improving work and improving leadership. And when the opinions of advanced producers receive full attention and support from the newspapers, their political enthusiasm will be further encouraged.

At the same time, our newspapers can only truly strengthen their ties with the broad masses and truly strengthen the mass character of the newspapers by first strengthening their ties with the active elements among the masses, sharing their destiny and breathing the same air.

In this sense, the above-mentioned practices of several newspapers that pay attention to reflecting the opinions of advanced producers are welcome. Of course, our newspapers should not only reflect the opinions and demands of advanced producers when advanced producers' representative conferences are held, but also make it a practice to reflect their opinions and demands frequently. Not only should we fully reflect the opinions and demands of advanced producers on the industrial front, but we should also pay attention to reflecting the opinions and demands of advanced producers and advanced workers on various fronts. Not only should we enthusiastically support the criticisms and suggestions of advanced producers, but we should also fight for their criticisms and suggestions to achieve practical results. Newspapers can also adopt various forms to reflect the opinions of advanced producers, such as interview notes, records of forums, or short letters from readers. This will encourage more advanced producers to express their opinions. Let all our newspapers be constantly filled with the voices of advanced producers! Newspaper Review

### 经常地反映先进生产者的意见

    经常地反映先进生产者的意见
    钟怀
    现在，许多报纸都在用大量的篇幅和主要的地位报道先进生产者的创造性劳动，介绍他们在各个战线上的成就和胜利。有一些报纸不仅广泛地宣扬了先进生产者的先进事迹、先进思想，而且注意用各种方式反映先进生产者的意见和要求，这是很值得提倡的。
    江西省召开首届工业先进生产者代表会议的时候，江西日报用了很大的篇幅，在“工业先进生产者们的意见”的标题下，先后三次发表了参加会议的代表们的许多意见。广西日报曾经邀请出席广西省工业、交通运输业先进生产者代表会议的一些代表举行座谈会，并且把他们的意见和要求提到报纸读者的面前来。中国青年报在全国先进生产者代表会议期间，派记者访问了一部分先进生产者，经过访问在报纸上传达了先进生产者的意见。
    先进生产者的意见中，提出了当前工业生产高潮和先进生产者运动中许多值得注意的问题。
    在江西日报所发表的先进生产者的意见中就反映出：许多厂矿发动群众不充分不全面，只注意主要工种，不注意辅助工种；只注意生产工人，不注意企业管理人员和工程技术人员；帮助后进赶上先进的工作做得很差。例如有的矿山只抓风钻工，不去发动爆破工和运输工；有的建筑企业虽然重视发动了泥木工，可是对技术人员和粉刷、油漆等工种注意得很少。这样，不少单位尽管新纪录不断出现，国家计划却完成得并不好。
    桂林邮电局和别的单位的一些先进生产者，在广西日报上揭露了某些企业领导者的官僚主义倾向。桂林邮电局的刘国桢说，他们单位有一个报务员一年没有出过一次差错，这在他们单位来说是一件了不起的事，但是局的领导干部看不起这个经验，没有很好地总结推广。同样地，南宁邮电局也是很久以来没有总结过工人的先进经验，推广全国行之有效的先进经验也做得不很好。南宁邮电局的先进生产者刘小素用了“自生、自长、自灭”这几个字来描写先进生产者及其经验在本单位的遭遇。
    从中国青年报发表的“王崇伦开会忙”、“罗烈芳什么时候能上船”、“‘森林医生’很担心……”等文章中，可以看出过多的会议和社会活动已经成为先进生产者的沉重负担。“我跟你算一笔账吧”，王崇伦对报纸的记者说，因为要参加各式各样的会议和慰问团，他在“1954年只干了七十多天活；1955年到今年一月被提为车间副主任以前，基本上没有干活”。也正如王崇伦所说的，“白帽子是无法领导整个车间生产的”，因此，先进生产者迫切要求给他们更多的时间，让他们实际地参加生产和工作，迅速地提高业务和技术，好为社会主义建设做出更大的贡献。
    先进生产者向报纸提出的问题极其广泛。他们不但提出了当前生产上的一些迫切问题，也反映了群众生活方面的某些重要问题，例如有的企业在工资工作中没有认真贯彻执行按劳付酬的原则；有的企业在奖励制度上存在着不及时、不合理、不全面的缺点；有的企业对工人生活漠不关心，食堂办得很糟，工人常常吃不到热饭热菜。
    先进生产者在揭发工作中的问题，批评工作中的缺点的同时，往往提出了改进工作的建议。在江西日报上，我们就曾经读到在企业科室人员中开展同业务竞赛的建议，这个建议包括四项具体的内容，是先进生产者刘士明针对劳动竞赛中不少企业的科室人员没有充分发动起来这一缺点提出的。我们也读到了建筑业先进生产者陈义贤的建议，他根据建筑业中泥工和附工配合得不好的情况，以自己的经验提出了泥工怎样主动取得附工配合、共同完成计划的有益的意见。
    先进生产者是人民群众的先驱和核心，又是国家和人民群众之间的重要纽带。他们能够锐敏地发现生产上和工作中的问题，提出尖锐的批评和有价值的建议；他们能够准确地表达出群众的要求，并且以自己的言语和行动来影响群众。“没有先进生产者，也就不可能有完全正确的领导”。（刘少奇代表中共中央在全国先进生产者代表会议上的祝词）在报纸上经常地反映先进生产者的意见，对于改进工作、改进领导无疑地有很大的好处。而当先进生产者的意见得到报纸的充分重视和支持的时候，他们的政治积极性也就会进一步受到鼓舞。
    同时我们的报纸也只有首先加强了同群众中的积极分子的联系，同他们共命运、同呼吸，才可能真正地加强同广大群众的联系，真正地加强报纸的群众性。
    从这个意义上说，上面所说的几个报纸注意反映先进生产者意见的做法，是值得欢迎的。当然，我们的报纸不只是要在召开先进生产者代表会议的时候反映先进生产者的意见和要求，而且要做到经常地反映他们的意见和要求。不只是要充分反映工业战线上的先进生产者的意见和要求，而且要注意反映各个战线上的先进生产者、先进工作者的意见和要求。不只是要热情地支持先进生产者的批评和建议，而且要为他们的批评和建议取得实际效果而斗争。报纸反映先进生产者的意见也可以采取多种多样的形式，可以是访问记，座谈会的纪录，也可以是简短的读者来信。这样就可以鼓励更多的先进生产者发表自己的意见。让我们所有的报纸经常充满着先进生产者的声音！报刊评介
