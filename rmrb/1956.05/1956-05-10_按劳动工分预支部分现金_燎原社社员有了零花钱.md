    By Prepaying Part of the Cash According to Work Points
    Members of the Liaoyuan Cooperative Have Pocket Money
    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 8th -- The Liaoyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jieyu County, Shanxi Province, regularly prepays a portion of cash to its members according to their work points, solving the problem of frequent pocket money needs for over 960 households. Members already received their first batch of pocket money in April, and the management committee is preparing to prepay the second batch on May 10th. For widowed, orphaned, and childless households with no or weak labor capacity, a preferential prepayment system is also in place, providing them with pocket money equivalent to that of ordinary member households.
    The source of these prepaid and pre-borrowed funds mainly comes from the cooperative organizing surplus labor for eight sideline productions, including flour mills, oil presses, tofu workshops, brick kilns, and pig farming. Among these, the newly established and expanded five sideline productions recently increased net income by more than 10,200 yuan. In addition, 30% is drawn from cotton pre-purchase funds to address the need.
    In addition to collectively solving the pocket money problem for its members, this cooperative has also adopted various methods to help members engage in household sideline production. Not long ago, the cooperative helped 965 member households buy back 2,800 high-quality breed chickens and ducks from the county farm, and mobilized members to breed and raise more than 3,000 local chickens. Zhai Ledao, a member, earned more than 8 yuan in two months from the three egg-laying hens he raised.
    In addition, agricultural cooperative cadres regularly instill thrifty education in members through small-scale heart-to-heart talks and individual conversations, and specifically help some members develop reasonable spending plans. For example, member Chai Zuoqin did not know how to manage household affairs in the past, spending whatever he had. After personal careful calculations, he began to have a surplus in April.

### 按劳动工分预支部分现金  燎原社社员有了零花钱

    按劳动工分预支部分现金
    燎原社社员有了零花钱
    新华社太原8日电  山西省解虞县燎原农业生产合作社定期按劳动工分预支给社员一部分现金，解决了九百六十多户社员经常零花钱的问题。社员们在四月份已经预支了第一批零花钱，现在管理委员会正筹备在五月十日给社员预支第二批零花钱。对无劳力和劳力不强的鳏寡孤独户通过优惠预借的制度，也在同时发给他们相当于一般社员户的零花钱。
    这部分预支和预借现金来源，主要是社里组织了剩余劳力，进行粉坊、油坊、豆腐坊、砖窑、养猪等八项副业生产而得到的收入。其中新开辟的和扩大的五项副业生产最近就增加了纯收益一万零二百多元。另外还从棉花预购款中抽出30％加以解决。
    这个社除了集体解决社员零花钱的问题以外，还采取了多种多样的办法，帮助社员进行家庭副业生产，不久前社里帮助965户社员从县农场买回优良品种鸡、鸭二千八百只，并发动社员繁殖喂养本地鸡三千多只。社员翟乐道喂养的三只下蛋母鸡，两个月间就收入八元多。
    另外农业社干部通过小型谈心会和个别谈话，向社员经常灌输勤俭教育，并具体帮助部分社员订出合理花钱计划。如社员柴作勤过去不会料理家务，有多少花多少，经过个人精打细算以后，四月份开始有了盈余。
