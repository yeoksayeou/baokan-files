Xinhua News Agency, May 21st: Comrade D.N. Aidit, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia, left Beijing by plane on May 21st to return home after concluding his visit to China.

Those who went to the airport to see him off included: Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee; Wang Jiaxiang, member of the Central Committee; and Li Chuli and Li Qixin, responsible working personnel of the central organs.

Xinhua News Agency, May 21st: D.N. Aidit, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia, issued the following written statement on the eve of his departure from Beijing:

　　On May 21st, I will leave Beijing to return to Indonesia. I stayed in China for nearly two months. During this period, I visited a number of places, light and heavy industrial factories, agricultural production cooperatives, primary and secondary schools and universities, nurseries, children's palaces, museums and exhibitions, visited scenic spots and historical sites, and watched artistic performances, etc.

　　Everywhere I went, I was welcomed with deep friendship. Everywhere I went, I was given full freedom to inquire about the experiences of the people I met in various work positions. From my conversations with the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, leaders of factories and agricultural production cooperatives, university professors and students, and leaders in cultural and educational fields, I have a deep impression of the Chinese people's great desire to build their socialist country, to be friendly with all countries, and to strengthen Asian and world peace.

　　I got the impression that the Chinese people are closely watching the development of the political situation in Indonesia. I can tell this from my conversations with factory workers, members of agricultural production cooperatives, primary and secondary school students and university students. Due to the Bandung Conference, the victory of the Indonesian democratic forces in last year's general election, and finally the recent abolition of the "Round Table Conference Agreement," Indonesia is more widely known to the people in China.

　　Before leaving China, please allow me to once again express my gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people for giving me the opportunity to visit many places and many enterprises, and to watch artistic performances of a high standard. I return to Indonesia with the confidence that the friendship between the Indonesian and Chinese peoples will become even closer. The people of the two countries, with their revolutionary traditions, will make greater contributions to the cause of peace in Asia and the world.

    艾地同志离京回国并发表书面声明
    相信中国人民和印度尼西亚人民的友谊将会更加紧密
    新华社21日讯　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会总书记艾地同志结束他在中国的访问后，已在五月二十一日乘飞机离京返国。
    到机场欢送的有：中共中央政治局委员刘少奇、邓小平，中央委员王稼祥，中央机关负责工作人员李初梨、李启新等人。
    新华社21日讯　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会总书记迪·努·艾地在离开北京前夕发表书面声明如下：
    五月二十一日我将离开北京返回印度尼西亚。我在中国逗留将近两个月。在这期间，我参观了若干地方、轻工业和重工业工厂、农业生产合作社、中小学校和大学、托儿所、少年宫、博物馆和展览会，游览了名胜古迹，并观看了艺术表演等等。
    人们到处怀着深厚的友谊来欢迎我。我到处得到充分的自由去询问我所遇到的在各个工作岗位的人们的经验。从我和中国共产党的领袖、工厂和农业生产合作社的领导人，大学教授和大学生和文化教育方面的领导人的谈话中，我对中国人民建设他们的社会主义国家、同所有的国家友好和加强亚洲和世界和平的巨大愿望，有着深刻的印象。
    我得到这样的印象：中国人民密切地注视着印度尼西亚政局的发展。从我和工厂的工人、农业生产合作社的社员、中小学生及大学生的谈话中，我可以知道这一点。由于万隆会议，由于印度尼西亚民主力量在去年的普选中的胜利，以及最后由于最近“圆桌会议协定”的废除，使印度尼西亚在中国更广泛地为人们所知道。
    请允许我在离开中国之前再一次地向中国共产党和中国人民表示感谢，他们给了我机会去参观了不少地方和不少企业，并观看有着高度水平的艺术表演。我怀着这样的信心回到印度尼西亚去，即印度尼西亚人民和中国人民的友谊将会更加紧密。具有革命传统的两国人民将会对亚洲和世界的和平事业做出更大的贡献。
