    Beginning Construction of the Xianghongdian Reservoir

    The highway and tunnel projects for the Xianghongdian Reservoir have already started construction ahead of schedule. This project is one of the five large reservoirs planned to be built on the Huai River this year. It is located in the western source of the Pi River in Jinzhai County, Anhui Province, in the middle reaches of the Huai River. The total capacity of the reservoir is 2.085 billion cubic meters, and the scale and workload of the project are even larger than the Meishan Reservoir. After the completion of this reservoir, together with the completed Foziling Reservoir and the soon-to-be-built Lianghekou Reservoir and Mozitan Reservoir, it can fundamentally eliminate flood disasters in the Pi River basin and can irrigate 4.5 million mu of farmland.

    开始修建响洪甸水库
    响洪甸水库的公路和隧洞工程已经提前开始施工。这个工程是今年计划在淮河修建的五座大型水库之一，它在淮河中游安徽省金寨县境内的淠河西源，水库的总容量为二十亿八千五百万公方，工程的规模和工作量比梅山水库还大。这座水库建成后，配合已建成的佛子岭水库和即将修建的两河口水库和磨子潭水库，可以从根本上免除淠河流域的洪水灾害，并可以灌溉农田四百五十万亩。（单步湘）
