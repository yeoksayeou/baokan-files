    The first phase of Yunnan Province's second automated thermal power plant began construction in Kunming in early May. It is expected to be put into production by March of next year.

    After the completion of the first phase of this power plant, its power generation will be much greater than the total power generation of the current Kunming area power grid, which can meet the needs of industrial development in the Kunming area.

    The main engineering construction of this plant is designed with the help of the Czechoslovak Republic, and the machinery and equipment are also manufactured by the Czechoslovak Republic.

    云南兴建第二座自动化发电厂
    云南省第二座自动化火力发电厂第一期工程，五月上旬在昆明开工兴建，预计到明年三月份即可投入生产。
    这座发电厂的第一期工程完成以后，发电量将比现在昆明区电力网发电量的总和大得多，可以适应昆明地区工业发展的需要。
    这个厂的主要工程建筑是由捷克斯洛伐克共和国帮助设计的，机器设备也是捷克斯洛伐克共和国制造的。
