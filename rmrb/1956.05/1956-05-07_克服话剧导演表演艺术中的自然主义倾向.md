　　Overcoming Naturalistic Tendencies in the Performing Arts of Theater Directors
　　Sun Wei Shi
　　The first National Drama Festival produced a large number of talented directors and actors, which shows that under the leadership of the Party and the guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy, drama workers have the confidence and strength to greet the high tide of the country's cultural construction with the prosperity and development of the artistic cause.
　　In this festival, a significant and widespread shortcoming in directing and performing arts is the question of the reality of life and the reality of art. Many unimportant and trivial details of life have appeared on our stage. These trivial details occupy precious stage time and space, weakening the expression of artistic reality. Many life phenomena are not all necessary or suitable for expression on the stage. Many actions in life must be selected, and then the most expressive ones should be used on the stage. If any "reality" is mechanically and photographically moved to the stage without selection, it will only destroy the reality of art and dilute the expressiveness of art.
　　Many actors' lines are not clear, their voices are too low, and their timbre is flat, lacking the power to convey rich inner emotions. Many important speeches, important turning points, and important events slipped by in a commonplace and ordinary way. Of course, we still lack training in lines and skills in expressing language, but some people also believe that only this flat, dull voice "is life" and "is real." We oppose the stereotypical stage accent with dragging tones, but we must also have stage language. Stage language is different from everyday language, and speaking quietly must also allow the audience in the last row to hear. We must also select rich timbres from life that can powerfully express inner emotions.
　　In some plays, actors take a long time to smoke a pipe; it takes a long time to pack things; it takes a long time to answer people's questions; standing on the stage, half of the face is facing the inside of the stage, only allowing the audience to see one ear. These situations exist in life, but we should not move life to the stage without selection.
　　From this festival, we can see many situations where the reality of life has destroyed the reality of art.
　　In some plays, dust flies on the stage, and actors playing farmers wipe their faces with dirty towels. In some plays, a prop – dung – was specially made. When the dung was scattered, they even used their hands to pick it up. In some plays, farmers spit on the ground. What help does this give to expressing the characters' thoughts and feelings? What educational significance does it have?
　　In some plays, the scene of a person dying after taking poison is performed for too long; especially when they stretch out their feet at death, with the soles of their feet facing the audience, giving a physiologically uncomfortable feeling. Death, injury, and disease originally have strong physiological pain in life, but we should not emphasize this physiological pain on the stage, as it can only cause physiological stimulation to the audience and cannot win their emotional touch.
　　Many trivial actions also appear on our stage: twisting thread, pouring tea, smoking, lighting a fire, washing clothes... repeatedly touching a piece of clothing when hanging it up, people who know the ropes know that the actor's heart is empty. The emptiness of the actor's heart cannot be filled with these actions, because these things not only cannot enrich the actor's heart, but will hinder the expression of inner actions and thoughts, and distract the audience's attention.
　　We are relatively sensitive to formalism. When the people on the stage lack a sense of reality, pretend, pose in good-looking poses, drag their tones, and circle around without a basis in life, we immediately recognize it, and everyone says in unison: "Formalism!" Formalism separates form and content, and only changes tricks in form. The form detached from the content will become empty and lifeless. We despise formalism.
　　We are also gradually becoming vigilant about the problem of formulaic conceptualization. Although this erroneous creative idea is still haunting our creations, we do not like this kind of work.
　　However, naturalism has not yet attracted enough attention, and we often confuse naturalism with learning from life and expressing life, so naturalism is safe and sound. We must affirm that it is correct to learn from life and express the reality of life. Our achievements today are inseparable from our efforts to learn from life, and we should continue to go deep into life and study life. However, we should recognize that naturalistic creative ideas will prevent us from learning from life in depth and will hinder us from expressing the important and essential things in life. The philosophical basis of naturalism is positivism, which denies the existence of objective laws of reality and limits the understanding of things to superficial phenomena. Naturalism reduces the role and significance of literature and art in reflecting life and does not value the methods of artistic expression. It makes it impossible for actors to create correct and comprehensive artistic images; and it goes into the quagmire of idealism that distorts reality.
　　In the creation of theater directing and performing arts, how to distinguish between naturalism and realism?
　　First, realism is selective about life, and it is necessary to select the main and refined things from the trivial phenomena of life. Realism requires artistic generalization and typification. Naturalism is to record life and list phenomena. Some comrades asked: "Then are all the life details such as twisting ropes, winding threads, pouring water, and pouring tea on the stage naturalism? Are only a few typical postures and actions allowed on the stage?" We say that anything on the stage that hinders the development of the inner actions of the characters, the superficial, superfluous and trivial things, must be discarded.
　　For example, when we are thinking, we break branches while thinking; the small action of breaking branches does not hinder our thinking, so it can be done. If winding thread and twisting thread are our subconscious actions and our labor habits, and at this time our main inner action is to ask a question, and the action of winding thread does not hinder the questioning, and sometimes stops and sometimes continues according to the character's inner activities, this action can also be done. If the actions of breaking branches and winding threads hinder thinking or questioning, and also bring the audience's attention to these actions, it becomes an unnecessary triviality of life.
　　Sometimes, the trivialities of life and the reality of life can destroy the reality of the stage and the reality of art. For example, washing the face with water on the stage, the audience is immediately taken out of the play, because they are afraid that the actor will wash off the greasepaint. Some people splash the wash water on the ground and onto the scenery, and the audience is again taken out of the play, fearing that the scenery will be ruined. The actor wipes tears with a dirty towel, and the audience is afraid that he will get an eye disease. The actor turns over the grass on the stage, causing dust to fly all over the stage, and the audience is afraid that the dust will blow down to the stage. These trivial actions take the audience out of the play and destroy the reality of art.
　　Second, emotional resonance should be aroused, and physiological stimulation should be eliminated. There are two different performance methods for expressing injury, illness, and death on the stage. One is bright red blood, the screams of the injured, and the struggle before death, although these are all real things in life; but moving them to the stage will give the audience physiological stimulation and obscure the audience's understanding of the inner world of these characters. In "Thousands of Rivers and Mountains," Lan Ma had two scenes where he was sick, but he did not leave the audience with physiological stimulation, but brought the audience into the character's thoughts and hopes. In my opinion, the performance that can arouse emotional resonance is a realistic performance, and the performance that causes physiological stimulation is a naturalistic performance.
　　Third, we must praise the good things in life and criticize the ugly things in life. We may see farmers grabbing dung with their hands and spitting on the ground casually in life; we cannot move such life phenomena to the stage in a photographic way, which will distort the essence of the peasants.
　　In our directing and performance, advanced representatives are often portrayed as if they are spiritually painful, neurotic, do not love life, do not love family, and are withdrawn... Perhaps individual advanced workers are like this, but why do we need to focus on describing and performing this way? Do we want to tell the audience that labor is painful? What we want to express is the perseverance and ardent desire to overcome difficulties. Our writers may have moments of scratching their hair, anxious, and unable to figure it out when writing; but there must also be a moment when the characters in their writing appear before their eyes and the spark of creation shines in their eyes, which is what we want to emphasize. Realism has thoughts and a position; while naturalism has no position and treats everything the same.
　　There is another difference between naturalism and realism: realism has a yearning for the future and poetry; naturalism is devoid of poetry, it has neither lofty thoughts and infectious poetry, nor poetry of beautiful yearning for the future, let alone the poetry of labor and creation. The poetry of labor and creation is what we perform the least on our stage. Naturalism takes the trivial and vulgar things as the focus of artistic description, and naturalism adopts a cold and indifferent attitude towards life.
　　The creative method of socialist realism requires us to devote ourselves wholeheartedly to the fiery struggle life, study life, understand the essential things in life, and artistically process the reality of life, refine it into the reality of art, create artistic types, and, through these artistic types, conduct socialist education to the broad audience. The naturalistic creative method is precisely to guide us to the completely opposite path.

　　克服话剧导演表演艺术中的自然主义倾向
    孙维世
    第一届全国话剧会演中，涌现出大批有才能的导演和演员，这说明在党的领导下，在毛主席文艺方针的指导下，话剧工作者是有信心有力量用艺术事业的繁荣和发展来迎接祖国文化建设的高潮的。
    这次会演在导演和表演艺术方面，有一个显著的、带有普遍性的缺点是关于生活的真实和艺术的真实问题。在我们的舞台上出现了生活中的许多不重要的琐碎细节。这些琐碎细节占据了珍贵的舞台时间和空间，削弱了艺术真实的表现。许多生活现象并不是都必须、都适合在舞台上表现的。对生活中的许多动作，必须经过选择，然后将最富于表现力的运用到舞台上来。如果毫不选择地把任何“真实”都机械地、照相式地搬到舞台上去，只会破坏艺术的真实，冲淡艺术的表现力。
    有许多演员的台词说得不清楚，说话声音太小，音色平板，缺乏传达内心丰富感情的力量。许多重要的说话、重要的转折、重要的事情都普普通通平平常常地滑过去了。当然，我们还缺乏台词的锻炼，缺乏表现语言的技巧，但是，却也有人认为只有这种平板、枯燥的声音“才生活”，“才真实”。我们反对拖腔拉调的、刻板化的舞台腔，可是我们也必须有舞台上的语言。舞台上的语言不同于生活中的语言，悄悄地说话也得让最后一排的观众听得见。我们还要从生活中选择能够有力地表达内心感情的丰富音色。
    在有些戏里，演员抽一袋烟要抽好半天；收拾东西，要收拾好半天；回答人家的话，也要停顿好半天；站在台上，半个脸朝着台里面，只让观众看见一只耳朵。生活中是有这种情形的，可是，我们不应该就把生活不加选择地搬到舞台上来。
    从这次会演中，我们可以看到许多生活的真实破坏了艺术的真实的情形。
    在有的戏里，台上尘土飞扬，扮农民的演员用脏手巾擦脸。有的戏里还专门制作了一件道具——大粪，粪撒了，还用手去抓起来。有的戏里农民随地吐痰。这对于表达人物的思想感情有什么帮助呢？又有什么教育意义呢？
    有的戏里，表演一个服毒的人临终的情形，把时间拖得太长；尤其是死时两脚一伸，脚底对着观众，给人一种生理上不舒服的感觉。死亡、受伤、疾病，在生活中本来有强烈的生理上的痛楚，我们在舞台上却不应该强调这种生理的痛楚，它只能引起观众生理的刺激，而不能博得他们心灵的感动。
    在我们的舞台上还出现许多琐碎动作：搓线、倒茶、抽烟、点火、洗衣服……晾一件衣服要反复地摸，内行的人一看就知道演员心里空虚了。演员内心的空白是不可能用这些动作来填补的，因为这些东西不但不能使演员的内心充实起来，反而会妨碍内在的动作和思想的表现，分散观众的注意。
    我们对形式主义是比较敏感的。当台上的人缺乏真实感、装模作样、摆着好看的姿式、拖腔拉调、没有生活根据而乱转圈子的时候，我们马上就认出来了，大家齐声说：“形式主义！”形式主义是把形式和内容割裂开来，光在形式上变花样。脱离了内容的形式就会成为空洞的、没有生命的东西。我们唾弃形式主义。
    我们对于公式化概念化的问题也逐渐警惕起来。尽管这种错误的创作思想还在我们的创作中作怪，我们是不喜爱这种作品的。
    但是，对于自然主义，却还没有引起足够的注意，我们常常把自然主义同向生活学习、表现生活混为一谈，于是自然主义就安然无恙了。我们必须肯定，向生活学习、表现生活的真实是正确的，我们能有今天的成绩是同我们努力向生活学习分不开的，我们还应该继续不断深入生活，研究生活。可是，我们应该认识，自然主义的创作思想会使我们不能够深入地向生活学习，会妨碍我们表达生活中重要的、本质的东西。自然主义的哲学基础是实证论，它否认现实客观规律的存在，把对事物的理解限于表面现象。自然主义降低了文艺反映生活的作用和意义，不重视艺术体现的方法，它使得演员不能够创造出正确的、全面的艺术形象；而且走到歪曲现实的唯心主义的泥沼中去。
    在话剧导演和表演艺术的创作中，怎样区别自然主义和现实主义呢？
    第一，现实主义对生活是有选择的，要从烦琐的生活现象中选择出主要的、精致的东西。现实主义要求艺术的概括和典型化。自然主义却是记录生活，罗列现象。有的同志问：“那么凡是在舞台上搓绳、缠线、倒水、倒茶等生活细节，都是自然主义吗？舞台上是不是只允许有几个典型的姿态和动作呢？”我们说，凡是在舞台上妨碍人物内在动作发展的、外表的、多余琐碎的东西，都是要摈弃的。
    譬如我们在思索的时候，一边思索一边折断树枝；折断树枝这个生活的小动作，并没有妨碍我们的思索，那是可以这样作的。如果缠线、搓线是我们的下意识的动作，是我们劳动的习惯，而这个时候我们主要的内在动作是询问一个问题，缠线的动作并不妨碍询问，并且根据人物的内心活动时而停止，时而继续，这个动作也是可以作的。要是折树枝、缠线这些动作，妨碍了思索或是询问，并且把观众的注意力也带到这些动作上去，那就成了不必要的生活琐碎了。
    有时候，生活的琐碎、生活的真实会破坏舞台的真实和艺术的真实。例如在台上用水洗脸，观众一下子就出了戏，因为他们怕演员把油彩洗掉了。有的人把洗脸水往地下乱泼，洒到布景上，观众又出了戏，怕把布景弄糟了。演员用脏手巾擦眼泪，观众怕他生眼病。演员在台上翻草弄得满台飞尘，观众怕尘土吹到台下来。这些琐碎的动作，把观众带到戏外，破坏了艺术的真实。
    第二，应该唤起感情的共鸣，排除生理的刺激。在舞台上表现受伤、疾病、死亡，有两种不同的表演方法。一种是鲜红的血、受伤的人的喊叫、临死前的挣扎，虽然这都是生活中真实的东西；但是搬到舞台上便会给观众生理上的刺激，并且遮掩了观众对这些人物内心的理解。蓝马在“万水千山”中有两幕是生病，但是他并没有给观众留下生理的刺激，而是把观众带到角色的思想和希望中去。我认为，能够唤起感情共鸣的是现实主义的表演，引起生理刺激的便是自然主义的表演。
    第三，要表扬生活中美好的东西，抨击生活中丑恶的东西。我们在生活中可能看到农民用手抓大粪，随便在地上吐痰；我们不能够把这样的生活现象，照相式地搬到舞台上去，这样反而会歪曲农民的本质。
    在我们的导演和表演上，往往把先进的代表人物表现得好像精神上很痛苦，神经质，不爱生活，不爱家庭，性情孤辟……。也许先进工作者中间有个别的人是这样，但是我们有什么必要着重地这样描写和表演呢？难道我们要告诉观众——劳动是痛苦的吗？我们要表现的是克服困难的坚毅精神和热烈愿望。我们的作家在写作的时候可能有抓头发，着急，苦思不得其解的时候；但也必定有眼前浮现出了笔下的人物、创作的火花在他的眼睛里闪耀的一刹那，这便是我们要着重传达的。现实主义是有思想，有立场的；而自然主义则是毫无立场，对一切事物都是同样对待。
    自然主义和现实主义还有一个区别：现实主义对未来有向往，有诗意；自然主义是毫无诗意的，它既没有崇高的思想和感染人的诗意，也没有对未来美好向往的诗意，更没有劳动创造的诗意。劳动创造的诗意是我们舞台上表现得最不够的。自然主义把渺小庸俗的东西当作艺术描写的重点，自然主义对生活采取冷眼旁观的态度。
    社会主义现实主义的创作方法要求我们全身心地投入火热的斗争生活中，研究生活，认识生活中本质的东西，将生活的真实经过艺术的加工，提炼为艺术的真实，创造出艺术的典型，并且，通过这些艺术的典型，向广大观众进行社会主义教育。而自然主义的创作方法，恰恰要把我们引导到完全相反的道路上去。
