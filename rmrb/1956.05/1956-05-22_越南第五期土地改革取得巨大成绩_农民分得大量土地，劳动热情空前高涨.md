Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 21st: According to recent statistics from the Central Land Reform Committee of Vietnam, nearly 380,000 Vietnamese acres of land have been distributed to landless and land-poor farmers during the massive fifth phase of land reform in Vietnam. At the same time, farmers have also received more than 35,000 head of cattle, over 980,000 pieces of agricultural implements, and large quantities of grain.

The fifth phase of land reform in Vietnam began gradually around December last year. So far, the provinces of Nghe An, Quang Binh, Bac Ninh, and Thai Binh are nearing completion, and other areas are also accelerating progress.

In the areas where land reform has been completed or is underway, farmers' lives have undergone tremendous changes. Their labor enthusiasm has soared to unprecedented heights. According to incomplete statistics, in areas where land reform has been carried out, the planting area for early rice this year has exceeded the original plan by 4%.
