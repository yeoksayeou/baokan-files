    Meeting Workers' Demands for Technical Learning

    Editor:

    I am a young worker in the Fourth Workshop of the Shenyang Municipal State-Operated Small Switch Factory. Nearly 80% of our workshop consists of young people, and our technical skills are quite low. In the past, because the products were relatively simple, only ordinary switch lamp holders were made, and low technical skills could still cope. Now, there are more and more new products, and all kinds of control equipment on precision machine tools are being processed and manufactured, and the technical requirements are relatively complicated; however, apart from the director and technicians in our workshop, most workers can't even understand the drawings. When working, they rely on their memory, which can easily cause errors. For example, when installing the four-corner flower wheel of a transfer switch, they made a mistake because they didn't understand the drawing, and even installed the cover backwards. Some parts are always difficult to install, and after a long time, they still don't know whether there is a problem with the installation or with the processing of the parts.

    Therefore, we deeply realize that to produce well, we must study technology well, at least let us learn to read drawings. However, the factory leadership has failed to meet this basic requirement put forward by everyone. In the first half of last year, because there were many opinions, the factory organized a drawing reading class in our workshop. This class only lasted for one month, and it was also poorly run. Those who couldn't understand the drawings originally still couldn't understand them after studying! Since then, no one has asked about this matter, and even spare-time technical learning has disappeared. There was no way, so I discussed with Comrade Li Zhenye, the workshop inspector, and decided to study together at the private Dongfang Mechanical Drawing Tutoring School. The study time was in the evening, two hours every day, and the results were seen in half a year. Not long ago, I improved two tools, one of which improved efficiency three or four times, which was very helpful for production!

    However, studying at a private technical school outside the factory is not a long-term solution after all. First, the study time cannot be guaranteed, especially since there are many meetings in the factory at present, which often start after work and last until seven or eight o'clock; second, learning outside is not easy to closely integrate with the factory's production, and what is needed is often not learned. Therefore, in February of this year, as a member of the Youth Supervision Post, I once again raised opinions to the leadership, requesting the factory to organize technical learning. When comrades from the Shenyang Municipal Local Industrial Trade Union solicited opinions from advanced competitors in the factory, I raised this issue again. But until today, I haven't heard anything, and I don't know why!

### 满足工人学习技术的要求

    满足工人学习技术的要求
    编辑同志：
    我是沈阳市地方国营小型开关厂第四车间的青年工人。我们车间里差不多有80％是青年人，技术水平都很低。在过去，由于产品比较简单，只做些普通的开关灯头，技术低还可以应付过去。现在新产品越来越多，加工制造的全是精密机床上的各种控制设备，技术要求都比较复杂；可是我们车间除了主任和技师外，大部分工人连图纸都看不懂，干活的时候就凭脑子记，很容易造成错误。例如安装转换开关的四角花轮，因为看不懂图纸就弄错了，连盖子都装反了。有的部件老安装不好，弄了半天还不知道是安装有问题还是部件加工有问题。
    因此，我们深深体会到：要生产得好就必须好好学习技术，至少要让我们学会看图纸。但是，工厂领导方面对大家提出的这一点起码的要求，都不能给以满足。去年上半年由于大家的意见多了，厂里才在我们车间办了个看图学习班。这个班只办了一个月，又办得很糟，本来看不懂图纸的，学了还是看不懂！从此以后，谁也不来过问这件事，就连业余技术学习也没有了。没有办法，我就和车间检查员李振业同志商量，决定一块到私立东方机械制图补习学校去学习。学习的时间在晚上，每天两个钟头，结果半年就见了效。不久前，我就改进了两种工具，其中一种就提高了效率三、四倍，对生产很有帮助！
    但是到厂外私人技术学校学习，毕竟不是长久之计。第一，学习时间不能保证，特别是目前厂里会议很多，往往下班一开就开到七、八点钟；第二，在外边学和厂里的生产不容易紧密结合，需要的往往学不到。因此在今年二月，我以青年监督岗岗员的身份又向领导方面提出意见，要求厂里组织技术学习。在沈阳市地方工业工会的同志向厂里竞赛先进者征求意见的时候，我又把这个问题提了出来。但是直到今天，还听不到什么动静，不知道原因何在！
