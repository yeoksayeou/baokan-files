Xinhua News Agency, May 8th: According to a report in the New York "Worker's Daily" on May 6th, the Communist Party of the United States recently held an expanded meeting of its National Committee in New York headquarters, lasting four days, to discuss the domestic and international situation and issues related to the election. This was the first formal meeting of the National Committee since the majority of its members were imprisoned under the Smith Act in 1951.

The expanded meeting of the National Committee unanimously adopted a report presented by the party's General Secretary, Dennis.

In his report, Dennis pointed out that the growing global demand for peace and disarmament has forced the American ruling class and the two major parties to begin some painful re-evaluation of their foreign policy. He said, "Although both major parties are trying to continue to pursue—albeit in a modified way—the basic policy of the monopoly capitalists' Cold War plan," in reality, "the danger of war has been reduced."

Speaking about the domestic political situation, Dennis said: "A deep political crisis is developing within the Democratic Party, and a serious constitutional crisis is occurring in the United States." He pointed out that today, "there is a resurgent Black liberation movement, the climax of which has reached an unprecedented scale, especially in the states of Alabama, Mississippi, and South Carolina."

In his report, Dennis called for the establishment of "a new labor-democratic front that can influence the next government and Congress, so that a government and Congress can be in power that guarantee the following: peace negotiations and easing international tensions; promoting the security of working people at the expense of the interests of monopoly capitalists; upholding the constitution and implementing civil rights legislation."

Fifty leaders from major state party organizations attended this expanded meeting of the National Committee. William Z. Foster, the chairman of the Communist Party of the United States, who is currently ill, also attended the meeting briefly.

It was announced after the meeting that the Communist Party of the United States would hold its Sixteenth National Congress in December this year.

### 建立新的劳工阵线争取和平民主  美国共产党的号召

　　建立新的劳工阵线争取和平民主
    美国共产党的号召
    新华社8日讯  据纽约“工人日报”五月六日报道，美国共产党最近在纽约全国总部举行了历时四天的全国委员会扩大会议，讨论国内外形势和有关大选的问题。这是自从1951年全国委员会的大多数委员根据史密斯法遭到监禁以来全国委员会第一次举行的正式会议。
    全国委员会扩大会议一致通过了党的总书记丹尼斯提出的一篇报告。
    丹尼斯在报告中指出，全世界对和平和裁军的要求的增长已经使美国统治集团和两大党不得不开始对外交政策作某种忍痛的重新估计。他说，“虽然两大党都竭力要继续推行——虽然是以一种修改了的方式——垄断资本家的冷战计划的基本方针”，但是实际上，“战争的危险性已经减少了。”
    丹尼斯在谈到国内政治情况的时候说：“民主党内部正在发展着一个深刻的政治危机，美国国内正在发生严重的宪政危机。”他指出，今天“出现了重新恢复了力量的黑人解放运动，这个运动的高潮已经达到空前壮大的程度，特别是在亚拉巴马、密士失必和南卡罗来纳各州。”
    丹尼斯在报告中号召建立“一个新的劳工民主阵线，这个阵线应当能够影响下届的政府和国会，从而能够使一个保证实行下述各点的政府和国会当政：和平谈判和缓和国际紧张局势；在牺牲垄断资本家的利益下促进劳动人民的安全；维护宪法，执行民权法案。”
    参加全国委员会这次扩大会议的有来自各个主要的州党组织的五十位领导人，正在病中的美国共产党全国委员会主席福斯特也短时地出席了这次会议。
    会议结束后宣布，美国共产党将在今年十二月举行第十六次全国代表大会。
