Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, May 19th: Another modern precision machine tool manufacturing plant in China, the Chengdu Cutting Tool Factory, started construction on the 15th. Its designed production capacity is even larger than the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant built in 1954.

This factory is being built to meet the needs of industrial development in the Southwest and Northwest regions. Once completed, it will produce various precision measuring tools and cutting tools.

Measuring tools are used to determine the accuracy of products; cutting tools are used to cut metal and drill holes in metal. They are both indispensable tools for industrial sectors to manufacture precision machinery and equipment. The factory will produce forty-nine categories of cutting tools, with 2,086 specifications. The smallest drill bit will have a diameter of only 0.25 millimeters, equivalent to the thickness of three and a half human hairs. The precision of these products is very high. The error in length and parallelism of some advanced gauges will not exceed 0.7 to 1.5 microns, only one-thousandth of the thickness of newsprint.

This technically complex factory will adopt modern equipment and advanced technological methods throughout. The workshops will be equipped with various automated and semi-automated machine tools controlled by electric buttons. The temperature, humidity, and dust in the workshops will also be entirely controlled by machines. Most of these machines and equipment will be supplied by our own country, and some of the latest Soviet products will also be used.

The basic construction of the Chengdu Cutting Tool Factory has entirely adopted the complete set of Soviet designs and construction experience from the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant. Taking into account the differences in geology and regional climate, some changes and improvements have been made to certain projects. The construction progress will be much faster than the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant. It took only more than eighty days from preparation to commencement of construction, and the entire project is expected to be completed in one and a half years. The time from preparation to completion will be shortened by about two years compared to the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant. The factory's tool workshop and repair workshop will be put into production by the end of this year.

    我国又一座现代化的精密机械工具制造厂
    成都刃具厂开工兴建
    新华社成都19日电　我国又一座现代化的精密机械工具制造厂——成都刃具厂十五日动工兴建。它的设计生产能力比1954年建成的哈尔滨量具刃具厂还大。
    这个厂是为适应西南和西北地区工业发展的需要而建设的，建成以后将生产各种精密的量具和刃具。
    量具是用来测定产品的准确程度的；刃具是用来切削金属和在金属上钻孔的。它们都是工业部门制造精密机器设备所不可缺少的工具。这个厂将来生产的刃具有四十九类，2，086种规格，最小的钻头的直径只有零点二五公厘，相当三根半头发的粗度。这些产品的精密度都很高，有些高级量规的长度和平行度的误差，不超过十万分之七公厘到十五公厘，只有报纸纸张厚度的千分之一。
    这个技术复杂的工厂，将全部采用现代化装备和先进的工艺方法。车间里装备的，是用电钮控制操作的各种自动化机床和半自动化机床；车间里的温度、湿度、灰尘也全部由机器控制。这些机器设备绝大部分由我国自己供给，也将采用一些苏联最新出产的产品。
    成都刃具厂的基本建设，全部采用了哈尔滨量具刃具厂的全套苏联设计和建厂经验，并且考虑到地质和地区气候的差异，在某些工程上作了若干变更和改进，建设进度将比哈尔滨量具刃具厂快得多。这个厂从筹建到动工，只有八十多天，全部建成预计为一年半；从筹建到建成，比哈尔滨量具刃具厂缩短时间约两年。今年年底，这个厂的工具车间和修配车间就要投入生产。
