Xinhua News Agency, May 27th. TASS, New York, May 26th: Approximately 20,000 Black and white workers held a Protect Civil Rights assembly at Madison Square, one of New York's largest venues, to protest the deprivation of Black people's human rights by reactionary forces in the United States. Speakers at the meeting pointed out that the attitude towards Black people within the United States proves the hypocrisy of the democratic slogans habitually used by American diplomats on the international stage. The assembly was opened by Philip Randolph, president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. He suggested that attendees observe a moment of silence for some of the Black people who had died tragically. Randolph said that this meeting was convened to condemn the heinous and unbelievable actions of the new Ku Klux Klan "White Citizens' Councils." Randolph said that these people want to deprive Black people of their political rights and unions of their economic rights. Therefore, they shot Black people away from the ballot box. They rely on reactionary laws and police to deprive unions of their rights.

Randolph called on Black and white workers, as well as agricultural laborers in the South, to unite against their main enemies: semi-feudal farm owners, big merchants and big entrepreneurs, and deceitful politicians.

Roy Wilkins, executive secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and the famous actress Tallulah Bankhead both sharply criticized the U.S. government for turning a blind eye to various actions that grossly violated civil rights.

Attendees pledged to wage a persistent struggle to eliminate racial discrimination in the United States.

    纽约两万工人集会
    抗议美国反动势力剥夺黑人人权
    据新华社27日讯　据塔斯社纽约二十六日讯：约有两万名黑人工人和白人工人在纽约最大的一个会场麦迪逊广场上举行了保护公民权利大会，抗议美国反动势力剥夺黑人的人权。在会上发言的人指出美国国内对待黑人的态度证明美国外交官在国际舞台上惯于使用的那些民主口号是虚伪的。大会由铁路员工车务员工会主席菲利普·伦道夫致开幕词。他建议到会者为一些死难的黑人默哀。伦道夫说，召集这次会议是为了谴责新的三K党“白人公民委员会”的可恶的和令人难以置信的行为。伦道夫说，这些人想剥夺黑人的政治权利和工会的经济权利。因此，他们开枪把黑人从投票箱前赶走。他们依靠反动的法律和警察来剥夺工会权利。
    伦道夫号召黑人工人和白人工人以及南方的农业雇工团结起来反对他们的主要敌人：半封建的农场主、大商人和大企业家、骗子政客。
    全国有色人种协进会执行秘书罗伊·威金斯和著名女演员塔鲁拉赫·班克海德都尖锐地指责美国政府对各种粗暴地破坏公民权利的行动熟视无睹。
    到会者保证要为取消美国的种族歧视而进行不懈的斗争。
