Striving to Become a Disease-Free Livestock County

    The leading organs of Rongchang County, Sichuan Province, have formulated a plan requiring the widespread implementation of livestock health care work throughout the county, striving to become a disease-free livestock county. To achieve this plan, the livestock health care stations in various districts have conducted health assessments of sows in various agricultural production cooperatives. Quarantine systems have been implemented in the county's pig markets, slaughterhouses, and pig storage facilities. The first batch of 300 epidemic prevention personnel trained by the County Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Workstation have been divided into many groups and sent to various townships to mobilize the masses to carry out disinfection work in pigsties and cattle pens, assist cooperatives in establishing livestock epidemic prevention groups, implement regular disinfection and regular inspection systems, and widely carry out swine fever vaccinations. According to the county's plan, efforts will be made to ensure that various livestock do not suffer from infectious diseases this year, and to eliminate swine fever, swine erysipelas, swine pleuropneumonia, and fowl plague by next year.
    The leading organs of Rongchang County require that swine fever vaccinations be combined with regular livestock health care work. As long as this effort is persistent, the plan for disease-free livestock can certainly be realized.

    争取成为家畜无病县
    四川省荣昌县的领导机关已经作出规划，要求在全县普遍开展家畜保健工作，争取成为家畜无病县。为了实现这个规划，各区的家畜保健站，在各个农业生产合作社中进行了对母猪的保健鉴定。全县的生猪市场、屠宰场和猪栈房等，已经开始实行检疫制度。县畜牧兽医工作站训练的第一批防疫员三百人，已经分成许多小组到各乡，动员群众开展一次猪舍、牛栏消毒工作，协助合作社成立家畜防疫小组，贯彻执行定期消毒、定期检查的制度，普遍进行猪瘟预防注射。按照县的规划，在今年内要做到各种家畜不患传染病，到明年要消灭猪瘟、猪丹毒、猪肺疫和鸡瘟。
    荣昌县的领导机关要求把家畜瘟疫的预防注射同经常性的家畜保健工作结合起来，只要这种努力坚持不懈，就一定可以实现家畜无病的规划。
