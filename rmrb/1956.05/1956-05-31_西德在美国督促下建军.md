Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, May 29th -- TASS reports: The West German "Federal Defense Council" held a special meeting in Bonn a few days ago to discuss the progress of the implementation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's plan for West Germany to establish an army of 96,000 men by the end of this year. West Germany's "General News" pointed out that the discussion of this issue was due to the United States' concern that the Soviet Union's decision to reduce its armed forces by 1.2 million men would affect West Germany's "defense efforts."

Newspaper reports indicate that the first batch of military pilots of the West German army has completed training. U.S. Air Forces in Europe Commander General Tunner recently told West German Air Force personnel that they would become part of a powerful tactical air force.

The West German Ministry of Defense announced that an air transport brigade and a rifle brigade will soon be established in the southern region of West Germany. Each brigade will have 6,000 men.

The work of training officers at all levels is also underway.

    西德在美国督促下建军
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社波恩消息：西德“联邦防务委员会”几天前在波恩举行了一次特别会议，讨论北大西洋集团规定西德在今年年底前建立九万六千名军队的计划的实施进展情况。西德“一般新闻”指出，所以讨论这个问题，是由于美国担心苏联裁减武装部队一百二十万人的决定会影响西德的“防务努力”。
    报纸消息表明：西德军队的第一批军事飞行员已经训练完成。美国驻欧洲空军司令滕纳将军最近对西德空军人员说，他们将成为一支强大的战术空军的一部分。
    西德国防部宣布，即将在西德南部地区开始建立一个空运旅和一个步枪旅。每个旅将有六千人。
    训练各级军官的工作也在进行着。
