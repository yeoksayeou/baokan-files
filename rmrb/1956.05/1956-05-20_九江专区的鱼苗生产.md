	Fish Fry Production in the Jiujiang Special District

	The Jiujiang Special District of Jiangxi Province has always been known throughout the country for its abundant fish fry production. In the one hundred and forty li area along the Yangtze River from Matou Town to Huifengji within this special district, fish fry are produced everywhere. Among them, grass carp, black carp, silver carp, and bighead carp are the most abundant. In addition to meeting the needs of the province, it also regularly supplies large quantities of fish fry to provinces such as Fujian, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang.

	This year, in order to adapt to the needs of agricultural cooperatives developing diversified operations, the Jiujiang Special District has vigorously developed fish fry production. This year alone, state-owned and cooperative-run fry catching sheds number sixty-seven, with a planned production of 540 million fish fry. Under the direct leadership of the Jiujiang Special District Fish Fry Production Management Committee, Jiujiang County, Ruichang County, and Jiujiang City have all established fish fry production and sales management stations to carry out the specific management of fish fry production. The Jiujiang County Fish Fry Production and Sales Management Station also took advantage of the fish fry production preparation period to organize aquatic product cadres from fish fry purchasing units in the province and Zhejiang Province to study operational techniques such as fish fry purchasing and transportation, and exchanged experiences with each other. The Jiujiang Railway Department has also adopted the "double-layer fish fry transportation method" to improve fish fry transportation efficiency and support fish farming production.

	Currently, the fish fry catching workers at various fish fry ports and the members of the fishery cooperatives are carrying out socialist competitions, striving to complete and overfulfill this year's production task of 540 million fish fry. (Our correspondent in Nanchang)

    九江专区的鱼苗生产
    江西省九江专区一向以盛产鱼苗著称全国。这个专区沿长江的马头镇到回峰矶的一百四十华里的地区内，到处出产鱼苗。其中以青、草、鲢、镛等鱼为最多。除了供应本省的需要以外，还经常以大量鱼苗供应福建、江苏、浙江等省。
    今年为了适应农业合作社发展多种经营的需要，九江专区大力发展了鱼苗生产。只国营、合作社营的捞棚，今年就有六十七个，计划生产鱼苗五亿四千万尾。在九江专区鱼苗生产管理委员会直接领导下，九江县、瑞昌县和九江市都成立了鱼苗产销管理站，进行鱼苗生产的具体管理工作。九江县鱼苗产销管理站还利用鱼苗生产准备期间，组织省内和浙江等省采购鱼苗单位的水产干部，进行了鱼苗采购、运输等操作技术的学习，互相交流了经验。九江铁路部门也采取“双层鱼苗运输法”来提高鱼苗运输效率，支持养鱼生产。
    目前，各鱼苗港埠的捞鱼苗职工和渔业合作社社员，正在开展社会主义竞赛，争取完成和超额完成今年五亿四千万尾鱼苗的生产任务。（本报驻南昌记者）
