　　Another Failure

After the North Atlantic Council meeting ended, the American side publicized that it did not expect the meeting to make any remarkable decisions. This was different from Dulles' original expectations. He originally said this was a "most important" meeting. It is interesting that the American side lowered its tone after the meeting. Because they saw this meeting as another failure of the American "strength" policy.

Recently, there have been two different tendencies within the North Atlantic Group. On the one hand, most member states, seeing the failure of the "strength" policy and the relaxation of the international situation, are increasingly dissatisfied with the heavy military burden imposed on them by the North Atlantic Group and the Cold War policy that the North Atlantic Group has created unease in Europe. They demand a reduction in the military nature of this group and focus on political and economic activities. Political leaders of countries such as France and Italy have publicly expressed this view more than once, and this view has received increasing support from more and more countries. The Icelandic Parliament even passed a resolution demanding the withdrawal of American troops. On the other hand, the American aggressive group is unwilling to abandon its "strength" policy and stubbornly wants to continue to maintain the North Atlantic Group as a military alliance to carry out the Cold War and prepare for a hot war. Due to this serious divergence, the North Atlantic Group is increasingly shaken and confused. Some Western newspapers have even warned that if this trend continues, the North Atlantic Group is in danger of disintegration. Because of this, the American aggressive group hurriedly convened this North Atlantic Council meeting, which Dulles called the "most important," wanting to emphasize the so-called "unity" of the North Atlantic countries on the basis of the American military bloc policy, in order to tighten the reins and maintain its control over the North Atlantic Group. But the situation at the meeting shows that the American ruling group did not achieve its goal. As the British "New Statesman and Nation" weekly pointed out, "The North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting was held in an atmosphere of more disorder and intense quarrel than usual." The countries demanding a change in the military nature of the North Atlantic Group did not abandon their demands, while the United States still wants to strengthen the so-called "defensive military aspects" of this group (according to Agence France-Presse, Paris, May 5th). The rift in this group was not only not healed at this meeting, but widened even further.

Dulles had to admit that the Soviet Union's foreign policy "is not based on the threat of force and military aggression," but he attributed the Soviet Union's consistent peace policy to the "unity" and strength of the North Atlantic Group as a military organization, that is, to the American military bloc policy; at the same time, he tried his best to spread the lie that the Soviet Union's threat of aggression has not been eliminated, in an attempt to stir up tension and prove how important it is to maintain the military bloc. Dulles also clamored that the United States will continue to support the Chiang Kai-shek group and prevent our country from liberating Taiwan. Dulles wanted to rely on reviving the "fear" of other countries to maintain the "unity" of the North Atlantic Group. This is Dulles' main plan. But on the other hand, given that many other countries in this group are demanding economic cooperation, he wanted to take advantage of the situation and use the guise of political and economic cooperation to strengthen the United States' control over other members of the North Atlantic Group not only in the military field, but also in the political and economic fields. But here, he encountered contradictions again. Now, the economic control that the United States has imposed on Western European countries through "embargoes" and American "aid" has aroused almost universal resistance from Britain and other Western European countries. Even at this North Atlantic Council meeting, France has already put forward a proposal to establish a world economic development agency whose power is not easily controlled by the United States, which does not use some of the United States' military groups such as the North Atlantic Group as distribution media, nor does it allow them to exert political pressure. Dulles wants to strengthen economic control by taking advantage of other countries' demands for economic cooperation, and even within the North Atlantic Group there are many difficult hurdles that are not easy to overcome.

In order to create a face-saving communiqué for this Council meeting, and in order to perfunctorily meet the demands of other participating countries, Dulles had to advocate that a special committee should discuss the issue of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's activities in non-military aspects. This is the origin of the three-person committee mentioned in the communiqué of this Council. This kind of perfunctory and deceptive trick will naturally not satisfy those countries that hope for economic cooperation. According to Reuters, Paris, May 6th, the representatives of many countries attending this meeting were very skeptical about what this committee could do, and they had "mixed feelings about the results of the two-day meeting, and had some doubts about whether the West had given the correct response to Moscow's friendly gestures." It can be seen that Dulles' clumsy methods cannot ease the increasingly sharp contradictions between the United States and many countries in the North Atlantic Group.

Some officials of the North Atlantic Group organization attribute the fruitlessness of this meeting to "insufficient preparation." This is self-deception. The actual reason is: the United States' military bloc policy and the policy of economically controlling other countries have caused great harm to other countries and have been universally rejected, but the American ruling group refuses to change this policy. Therefore, the real reason for the lack of achievement of the meeting is still the irreconcilable contradictions existing between the United States and many member states of this group.

### 又一个失败

　　又一个失败
    北大西洋集团理事会会议结束以后，美国方面宣传说它当初并没指望会议会作出任何引人注目的决定。这同杜勒斯原来的指望不同。他原来说这是一个“最重要的”会议。美国方面在会后这样放低调子是很有意思的。因为他们看到这个会议是美国“实力”政策的又一个失败。
    北大西洋集团内部最近有两种不同的倾向。一方面是大多数成员国因为看到了“实力”政策的失败和国际局势的缓和，愈来愈不满意北大西洋集团加在它们身上沉重的军备负担，不满意北大西洋集团给欧洲造成不安的冷战政策。它们要求减少这个集团的军事性质，而侧重政治、经济方面的活动。法国和意大利等国家的政治领袖曾经不止一次地公开提出过这种主张，这种主张得到了愈来愈多国家的支持。冰岛议会甚至通过决议要求美国军队撤退。另一方面，美国侵略集团却不愿意放弃它的“实力”政策，硬想继续保持北大西洋集团作为一个军事联盟来进行冷战和准备热战。由于这种严重的分歧，北大西洋集团内部日益动摇和混乱。西方的一些报纸甚至发出警告说：如果这种趋势继续发展下去，北大西洋集团就有瓦解的危险。因为这样的原故，所以美国侵略集团急急召开这个杜勒斯称为“最重要的”北大西洋集团理事会会议，想在这里强调在美国的军事集团政策基础上的所谓北大西洋国家的“团结”，以便拉紧缰绳，保持它对北大西洋集团的控制。但是会议的情况表明，美国统治集团并没有达到目的。正如英国的“新政治家与民族”周刊所指出的，“北大西洋公约组织的会议是在比平常更加紊乱和激烈争吵的气氛中举行的。”要求改变北大西洋集团的军事性质的各国并没有放弃它们的主张，而美国却还是要加强这个集团的所谓“防御性军事方面”（据法新社巴黎五日电）。这个集团的裂口在这次会议上不但没有弥缝起来，而且是开得更大了。
    杜勒斯不得不承认苏联的外交政策“不是以武力和军事侵略威胁为基础”，但是，他却把苏联一贯的和平政策归功于北大西洋集团作为一个军事组织的“团结”和力量，也就是归功于美国的军事集团政策；同时他又竭力散布苏联侵略威胁并未消除的鬼话，想借此煽动紧张空气，证明保持军事集团是如何要紧。杜勒斯还叫嚣美国将继续支持蒋介石集团，阻挠我国解放台湾。杜勒斯想靠复活其他国家的“恐惧”情绪来维系北大西洋集团的“团结”。这是杜勒斯的主要打算。但是，另一方面，鉴于这个集团的不少其他国家都要求经济合作，因此他就想顺水推舟，利用政治、经济合作的幌子来加强美国对北大西洋集团其他成员国不仅在军事方面、而且在政治和经济方面的控制。可是在这里，他又碰到了矛盾。现在美国通过“禁运”和美“援”等强加在西欧国家身上的经济控制，已经引起了英国和西欧其他国家几乎普遍的反抗。就是在这次北大西洋集团理事会上，法国也已经提出了一个建议，要成立一个其势不容易由美国控制的世界经济发展机构，这个机构不要美国的一些军事集团例如北大西洋集团做分配媒介，也不再让它们施加政治压力。杜勒斯想借别国对经济合作的要求来加强经济控制，就是北大西洋集团各国中也有许多不容易通过的难关。
    为了给这一次理事会会议搞一个遮掩门面的公报，为了敷衍其他参加会议国家的要求，杜勒斯不得不主张由一个特别委员会来商议关于北大西洋公约组织在非军事方面的活动问题。这就是这个理事会公报中所说的三人委员会的来源。这种敷衍欺骗的手腕，自然不会使那些希望经济合作的国家满意的。据路透社巴黎六日电，出席这次会议的许多国家的代表都非常怀疑这个委员会会有什么作为，他们对“两天会议的结果怀着混杂情绪，对西方是否对莫斯科的友好姿态给予了正确反应抱着某种怀疑”。可见杜勒斯的笨拙办法不可能缓和美国同北大西洋集团中许多国家的日益尖锐的矛盾。
    某些北大西洋集团组织的官员把这次会议的毫无结果说成是由于“准备得不充分”。这是自欺欺人之谈。实际的原因是：美国的军事集团政策和从经济上控制别国的政策使其他国家受害不浅，受到普遍的厌弃，而美国统治集团却不肯改变这种政策。因此，会议毫无成就的真正原因还是美国同这个集团的许多成员国存在着的不可解决的矛盾。
