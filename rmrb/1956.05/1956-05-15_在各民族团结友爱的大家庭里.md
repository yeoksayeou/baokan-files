Supplying Special Commodities for Minority Nationalities
At the market fair in Kaili Town, the seat of the Lushan Miao Autonomous County in Guizhou Province, the special commodities counter in the ethnic trade store was crowded with Miao girls. They were choosing embroidery thread, satin, dyes, and colorful silk ribbons processed by factories in Chengdu, Guiyang, and other places according to local designs. The lightweight and attractive plastic necklaces recently brought from Beijing aroused great interest among the girls. This is one of the thirty-two new special commodities for minority nationalities recently added by the ethnic trade store.

This year, state-owned commercial departments in minority areas of Guizhou Province have mostly set up special counters to sell special commodities favored by the Miao, Bouyei, and Dong people. Lushan Miao Autonomous County also supplies beeswax for Miao embroidery and Lusheng reeds for dancing.

New Routes on the Map
Red serpentine lines marking highways are rapidly extending into remote mountainous areas on the map of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture.

Trucks loaded with new farm tools, seeds, and daily necessities for the summer life of the people in the mountainous areas are continuously driving along the newly built roads to the county towns of Mubian County and Longlin Autonomous County of Various Nationalities on the edge of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. The highway from Nanning to Du'an Yao Autonomous County traverses the central mountainous area of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture and extends to Jiuxu in Hechi County, connecting with the He (Donghe) - Tian (Tianzhou) highway.

In the first four months of this year, a total of more than 500 kilometers of new and repaired roads were built in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, and a highway network crisscrossing the mountainous areas has been basically formed. By the end of this year, every county town in the entire autonomous prefecture will be accessible by car. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

Rich and Colorful Miao Songs and Dances

    在各民族团结友爱的大家庭里
    供应少数民族特需商品
    在贵州省炉山苗族自治县凯里镇的场集上，民族贸易商店的民族特需商品专柜前，拥满了苗族姑娘。她们在选择花线、缎子、染料和按当地式样由成都、贵阳等地工厂加工的各色丝织花边。新从北京运来的轻巧好看的化学项练引起了姑娘们很大的兴趣。这是民族贸易商店最近新增加的三十二种民族特需商品之一。
    贵州省少数民族聚居地区的国营商业部门今年大部分都设立了专柜，经营苗族、布依族和侗族人民喜爱的特需商品。炉山苗族自治县还供应苗族描花用的白腊和跳舞用的芦笙。
