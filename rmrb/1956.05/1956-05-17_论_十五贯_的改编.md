On the Adaptation of "Fifteen Strings of Cash"
Xia Yan

After watching the Zhejiang Kunsu Opera Troupe's performance of "Fifteen Strings of Cash," Comrade Tian Han said with great emotion at a gathering: "One play has revived an entire opera genre." This statement made me keenly aware of the importance of collating and adapting traditional plays. At the same time, I realized that doing a good job of collating a traditional play requires immense creative labor, and it is by no means an easy task.

The foundation of the play "Fifteen Strings of Cash" comes from the "Song Yuan Vernacular Stories," specifically "The Wrongful Execution of Cui Ning," which can be largely confirmed as a work from the Song Dynasty. In the late Ming Dynasty, Feng Menglong included it in the thirty-third volume of "Stories to Awaken the World," titled "Fifteen Strings of Cash: A Jest Leads to a Tragedy." In the early Qing Dynasty, the famous playwright Zhu Sushen supplemented and developed this "tragedy" story to create the "Fifteen Strings of Cash Legend" (also known as "Dream of Two Bears"), in two volumes and twenty-seven scenes, adapting it from a novel to an opera. The "Fifteen Strings of Cash" performed by the Kunsu Opera Troupe this time is a completely new work collated and adapted from Zhu Sushen's "Legend."

From "The Wrongful Execution of Cui Ning" to "Fifteen Strings of Cash Legend," and from "Fifteen Strings of Cash Legend" to the current Kun Opera "Fifteen Strings of Cash," each adaptation has involved bold additions, deletions, and creations. This is a process of "weeding through the old to bring forth the new," and this process is worthy of our study and learning.

Zhu Sushen's writing of "Fifteen Strings of Cash Legend" can only be said to have been inspired by the novel "The Wrongful Execution of Cui Ning" and to have adopted some of the original plot. This playwright of the early Qing Dynasty not only made bold creations in the shaping of character personalities and the depiction of typical environments, but also made completely new changes to the story itself. In "The Wrongful Execution of Cui Ning," Cui Ning was "wrongfully executed" and was not exonerated at the time. It was only because the murderer happened to marry the victim's wife as his "chieftain's lady," and inadvertently revealed the truth, that the case was solved. Therefore, this novel is just a legendary story, and its theme is merely to advise people to be "cautious between frowns and smiles" and not to make jokes casually. However, in Zhu Sushen's "Fifteen Strings of Cash Legend," three officials with different personalities were created, and the real historical figure Kuang Zhong, who was considered "Bao Gong reborn" in the Ming Dynasty, was made the protagonist, thereby clarifying the theme of opposing judges who rely on subjective judgments and disregard human life. Zhu Sushen was a talented person. His lyrics were praised as being "like a young girl wearing flowers, cherishing her appearance," so in order to make the plot more winding and colorful, he boldly rewrote Cui Ning and "Lady Shi Niang" who had no typical characters in the original work, into two pairs of young men and women with distinct personalities, Xiong Youlan, Su Shujuan, Xiong Youhui, and Hou Sangu. However, the shortcomings of this script are still very obvious. First, Zhu Sushen was overly enthusiastic about the "coincidence" of "a jest leading to a tragedy." The two lines of Xiong Youlan and Su Shujuan, Xiong Youhui and Hou Sangu, both suffered "coincidences", and the suspects happened to be fifteen strings of cash. In addition, it was a rat that harmed Xiong Youhui, and a villain named Lou A"rat" who harmed Xiong Youlan. Both cases fell into the hands of Guo Yuzhi. Even later, the Xiong brothers both "passed the imperial examination," and the examiner they encountered happened to be Guo Yuzhi himself. Drama (especially legendary drama) does not necessarily exclude "coincidence," but too much "coincidence" will inevitably weaken the authenticity and persuasiveness of the story. Second, although the playwright devoted great effort to depicting Kuang Zhong, this honest official, due to the limitations of historical conditions, he attributed the main opportunity for Kuang Zhong to discover the "wrongful case" to a "yellow beam dream" before the execution. Zhu Sushen named this script "Dream of Two Bears," which shows that he attached great importance to this dream, but in this way, it objectively weakened and harmed the character of Kuang Zhong as a bright, witty, and pragmatic person. Third, because he added the line of Xiong Youhui and Hou Sangu, there were two wrongful cases in total, and the on-site investigation and case solving had to be carried out separately. The "Male Prison" and "Female Prison" scenes were both good plays, so the script appeared to be sprawling and scattered in the middle. "Fifteen Strings of Cash Legend" has sixteen scenes in the first volume and thirteen scenes in the second volume. It is said that performing the complete script according to the old version would take three evenings, which is undoubtedly too long and too protracted. (In addition, the original also has some weaknesses, such as feudal lyrics and completely unnecessary "obscene language," etc.)

The "Fifteen Strings of Cash Organizing Group" of the Zhejiang Kunsu Opera Troupe, based on the principle of "discarding the dross and selecting the essence" and "weeding through the old to bring forth the new," carefully analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of Zhu Sushen's version and carried out repeated collation and adaptation. On the one hand, they proceeded with caution, preserving and promoting the advantages of the original, and on the other hand, they made bold and creative additions and deletions and processing in order to make the theme of the original more prominent and the character personalities more distinct. Li Yu, a great playwright of the Qing Dynasty, stipulated four key points for dramatic creation: "Reduce the number of clues, establish a main line, break away from stereotypes, and value simplicity and clarity." The "Fifteen Strings of Cash Organizing Group" faithfully adhered to these principles. In the past few years, we have achieved great success in collating traditional plays, but we have also made mistakes more than once. Some people were too timid, not deleting what should be deleted, not changing what should be changed, and some people were too reckless, deleting what should not be deleted and changing what did not need to be changed. Therefore, I think that comparing and studying Zhu Sushen's original work, and the Kunsu Opera Troupe's "Initial Revision" and "Revised Version" can provide beneficial inspiration.

The "Initial Revision" and the original are already very different, especially in the "establishing a main line" aspect, where excellent work has been done. However, perhaps because they could not bear to part with some of the good scenes, the work of "reducing the number of clues" was not done thoroughly. The "Initial Revision" has a total of eleven scenes, which is already much more concise than the original, but because it preserves the pattern of balanced development of the two lines of the Xiong brothers, not only are the clues still complicated, but in the Male Prison scene, the story of Xiong Youhui's wrongful accusation can only be explained by dialogue and singing. After a period of trial performance and exploration, the "Revised Version" made bold changes. This is based on the performance practice of Kunqu opera for many years and the testing of the masses. In addition to introducing the plot with images, the play retained "Rat Disaster," "Suspicion," and "Wrongful Accusation", it mainly retained the most wonderful scenes extracted in "Zhui Bai Qiu". In this way, the main line is concentrated on the line of Xiong Youlan and Su Shujuan, and inevitably, the line of Xiong Youhui and Hou Sangu can be naturally and easily deleted. In fact, "reducing the number of clues" is inseparable from "establishing a main line." When the branches are removed, the main trunk stands out.

The success of the "Revised Version" is not limited to this. In order to further strengthen the play's popular character and further portray typical characters, the organizing group made very brilliant additions at several important points, that is to say, the "Revised Version" not only deleted the characters and scenes that should be deleted and could be deleted, but also strengthened the creation of typical characters in typical environments without any traces of artifice. To give two examples, one is the "Sentencing" scene. Because Zhu Sushen's original work had the "Old Temple, Startling Dream" passage beforehand, Kuang Zhong immediately made up his mind to "go to see the governor overnight" when he heard the prisoner's appeal. The "Revised Version" added to the description of this scene and created the thrilling scene of "Kuang Zhong's Brush" written by Comrade Ba Ren. Secondly, the "Meeting the Governor" scene in Zhu Sushen's original work was also relatively cursory. After Kuang Zhong personally beat the drum, Zhou Cen of the Censorate (Zhou Chen in the original) quickly came out to meet him. The "Revised Version" arranged this scene in a very lively manner. After beating the drum, the first sound was "The Governor invites the Grand Master to meet in the living room." Kuang Zhong waited for a long time before the sound of "The Governor orders the standard-bearer to wait in the living room" was heard. Then, the adjutant entered and exited twice, after a long pause, coupled with a passage of Kuang Zhong's singing and acting, Zhou Cen finally appeared on stage. This passage in the "Revised Version" does not have many words, but it is a masterpiece of the supreme intelligence of artists who truly understand the essence of drama. The first is to strengthen the tense atmosphere of the whole play and conveniently describe the customs of officialdom, the second is to portray Zhou Cen's arrogance and make a clear contrast with Kuang Zhong's character, and the third is that at this point in the plot, like a coiled horse bending a bow, full but not fired, it makes the audience concentrate and hold their breath, waiting for the development of the situation.

Another advantage of the "Revised Version" is that it boldly deleted and revised the difficult-to-understand words and sentences of Kunqu opera, and carried out the work of "valuing simplicity and clarity" in the lyrics and dialogue. Generally speaking, the lyrics and music of the "Revised Version" did not lose the unique elegance of Kunqu opera, and on the other hand, it achieved a level that even people who do not understand the Jiangnan dialect can fully understand as long as they see the script or "lantern slides."

The adaptation of "Fifteen Strings of Cash" is the most prominent successful example in the work of opera reform, and the revised version of "Fifteen Strings of Cash" can be said to be a successful model for collating traditional plays. I think that every comrade engaged in the work of opera reform will definitely benefit a lot from carefully studying the collation process of this play.

    论“十五贯”的改编
    夏衍
    看了浙江昆苏剧团演出的“十五贯”之后，在一个集会上，田汉同志颇有感慨地说：“一出戏救活了一个剧种”。这句话使我痛感到整理改编传统剧目这一工作的重要，同时也体会到要整理好一个传统剧目，必须付出巨大的创造性的劳动，而决不是一件轻而易举的事情。
    “十五贯”这出戏的老底子出自“宋元话本”的“错斩崔宁”，大致上可以肯定是宋人的作品。明末冯梦龙把它编入“醒世恒言”第三十三卷，标名为“十五贯戏言成巧祸”。清初著名戏剧家朱素臣根据这个“巧祸”故事，补充发展而创作了“十五贯传奇”（亦名“双熊梦”）上下两卷二十七折，从小说改编为戏曲。这次昆苏剧团演出的“十五贯”，就是根据朱素臣的“传奇”整理改编出来的、面目一新的作品。
    从“错斩崔宁”到“十五贯传奇”，从“十五贯传奇”到现在演出的昆剧“十五贯”，每一次改作都有了大胆的增删和创造，这是“推陈出新”的过程，这过程很值得我们研究和学习。
    朱素臣写“十五贯传奇”，只能说从“错斩崔宁”这篇小说得到了启发，和袭用了原作的一部分情节。这位清初的剧作家不但在人物性格的塑造、典型环境的描写上有了大胆的创造，对故事本身，也有了面目一新的改作。“错斩崔宁”中崔宁是被“错斩”了，当时并没有得到平反，只是由于凶手碰巧地娶了被害者的妻子作为“压寨夫人”，无意中说出真情，才得破案。因此，这篇小说不过是一个传奇故事，它的主题也不过是劝人“颦笑之间，最宜谨慎”，不要乱开玩笑而已。可是，在朱素臣的“十五贯传奇”中，却创造了三个不同性格的官吏，把明代被认为“包公再世”的实在人物况钟作为主角，从而明确了反对判官凭主观草菅人命这个主题思想。朱素臣是一个颇有才华的人，他的词曲被评为“如少女簪花，修容自爱”，所以为了使剧情曲折多姿，他大胆地把原作没有什么典型性格的崔宁和“十娘子”改写成熊友兰、苏戍娟、熊友蕙、侯三姑这两对性格鲜明的青年男女。但是，这个剧本的缺点也还是很显著的，第一是朱素臣过分热中于“戏言成巧祸”的“巧”字，熊友兰与苏戍娟，熊友蕙与侯三姑这两条线同遭“巧祸”，被嫌疑的又恰巧同是十五贯钱；加上，害熊友蕙的是一只老鼠，害熊友兰是一个名叫娄阿“鼠”的歹人；两案同落到过于执手中；甚至后来熊氏兄弟双双“中式”，遇到的考官偏偏又是过于执本人。戏曲（特别是传奇剧）不一定排斥“巧合”，但是“偶合”和“巧合”太多，必然的就会削弱故事的真实性和说服力。第二是剧作者虽则以很大的力量描写了况钟这个清官，但是由于历史条件的限制，他把况钟发现“冤情”的主要契机，归之于判斩之前的“黄梁一梦”。朱素臣把这个剧本命名为“双熊梦”，足见得他对这一梦是看得很重要的，可是这样一来，客观上恰恰是削弱和伤害了况钟这个正面人物的精明、机智、实事求是的性格。加上第三，由于他附加熊友蕙和侯三姑这一条线索，冤案共是两起，踏勘破案就必须是分别进行，“男监”“女监”两场又都是好戏，因此剧本写到中段就显得支蔓而分散了，“十五贯传奇”卷上十六折，卷下十三折，据说，照老本子演完全本要演三个晚场，这无疑的是太冗长、太拖沓了。（这之外，原作也还有一些弱点，例如封建性的唱词，和完全不该有的“秽语”等等）
    浙江昆苏剧团“十五贯整理组”本“去芜存精”“推陈出新”的方针，细致地分析了朱素臣本的优点缺点，进行了反复的整理和改作。他们一方面谨慎从事，保存有发扬原作的优点，另一方面却又为了使原作的主题思想更加突出，人物性格更加鲜明，进行了大胆的、富有创造性的增删和加工。清代大剧作家李渔对戏剧创作规定了四项要点：“减头绪、立主脑、脱窠臼、贵浅显”。“十五贯整理组”忠实地遵守着这几个原则。在过去几年来，我们在整理传统剧目工作中获得了很大的成绩，但是我们也曾不止一次地犯过错误，有些人太胆怯，该删的不删，该改的不改，有些人太莽撞，不该删的删了，不必改的改了，那么，我认为把朱素臣的原作，和昆苏剧团的“初改本”和“整理本”核对研究一下，是可以得到有益的启发的。
    “初改本”和原作已经有了很大的不同，特别是在“立主脑”这一点上做了很出色的工作，但是，也许由于对其中的几场好戏不能割爱，所以对“减头绪”的工作未能做到彻底，“初改本”共十一折，已经比原作简练得多了，可是由于保存了熊氏兄弟两条线平衡发展这一格局，所以不仅头绪依旧纷繁，而且在男监一场，熊友蕙的含冤一节只能用说白和唱词来交代。经过了一段试演摸索，“整理本”又作了大胆的改作，这就是根据多少年来昆曲的演出实践，群众考验，这个本子除出为了要用形象来介绍剧情，改作和保留了“鼠祸”、“受嫌”、“被冤”三折之外，主要是保留了被拔萃在“缀白裘”中的几个最精彩的折子。这样，主线集中在熊友兰、苏戍娟一条线上，势所必至，熊友蕙侯三姑这一头绪就自然而轻易地可以删减掉了。事实上，“减头绪”是和“立主脑”分不开的，支蔓去了，主干就突出了。
    “整理本”的成功，不止于此。整理组为了更一步加强剧本的人民性，进一步刻划典型人物，在几个重要关节上作了非常精彩的加工，就是说，“整理本”不仅删掉了应删和可删的人物、场景，而且在毫无斧凿痕迹的情况下，加强了对典型环境中的典型性格的创造。举两个例子，其一是“判斩”这一场，朱素臣原作由于事先有了“宿庙、惊梦”这一段，所以一听犯人呼冤，况钟立即打定了“本府连夜去见都爷”的主意，而“整理本”则加重了这场戏的描写，创造了巴人同志所写的“况钟的笔”这一个惊心动魄的场面；其次，在“见都”这一场，朱素臣原作也是比较很草率的，况钟亲自击鼓之后，都察院周岑（原作周忱）就很快地出来接见了，“整理本”把这场戏铺排十分有声有色，击鼓之后，先是“都爷请太爷客厅相见”，况钟等了许久，才传出“都爷命旗牌客厅伺候”的声音，接着，中军上场下场二次，经过很长的顿逗，加上一段况钟的唱做，周岑方才上场。这一段在“整理本”中字数不多，但这却是真真懂得戏剧三昧的艺人们的绝顶聪明的杰作。这一段戏，第一是加强了全剧的紧张气氛，带便描写了官场习俗，第二是刻划了周岑的骄慢，和况钟的性格作了鲜明的对比，第三是剧情至此如盘马弯弓，满而不发，使观众凝神屏息，等待着事态的发展。
    “整理本”的另一个优点，就是大胆地删改了昆曲难懂的词句，在唱词和道白中也进行了“贵浅显”的工作。一般说来，“整理本”的词曲并没有失去昆曲特有的典雅，而另一方面，却做到了即使不懂江南方言的人，只要看到剧本或者“灯片”就可以完全理解的程度。
    “十五贯”的改作是戏曲改革工作中的一个最突出成功的例子，“十五贯”的整理本够得上说是一个整理传统剧目的成功的范本。我想，每一个从事戏曲改革工作的同志仔细地研究一下这个剧本的整理过程，一定会得到许多益处的。
