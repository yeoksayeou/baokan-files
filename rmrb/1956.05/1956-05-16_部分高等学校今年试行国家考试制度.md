Some higher education institutions will begin piloting a national examination system from 1956. Students who pass the national examination will be awarded expert qualifications in their respective majors by the National Examination Committee, in accordance with the provisions of the teaching plan, and will be issued graduation diplomas with expert qualifications by the university/institute president. Students whose grades in all courses are "Excellent" or "Good" and whose national examination results are "Excellent" will have "Excellent Performance" noted on their graduation diplomas according to the decision of the National Examination Committee.

The implementation of the national examination system is to better ensure the quality of graduating students. Higher education students can only participate in the national examination after completing all the theoretical courses and practical assignments stipulated in the teaching plan and passing all examinations and assessments. During the national examination, graduating students will undergo examinations in designated courses and defend their graduation theses or graduation designs, in accordance with the teaching plan of their respective majors. Students who fail the national examination or students who have completed their studies but cannot submit their graduation thesis or graduation design on time will be assigned work by the state first; however, they can apply to their original school to participate in the national examination again within three years after completion of their studies.

The national examination will be conducted by the National Examination Committee entrusted by the state. The chairman of the National Examination Committee is generally a professor or expert from outside the university.

The Ministry of Higher Education issued a draft of the Regulations on National Examinations for Higher Education Institutions on May 15. This draft regulation has been approved by the State Council. (Xinhua News Agency)

    部分高等学校今年试行国家考试制度
    从1956年起，部分高等学校将开始试行国家考试制度。国家考试及格的学生，由国家考试委员会按照教学计划的规定授予所学专业的专家资格，并且由校、院长发给专家资格的毕业文凭。全部课程考试成绩为“优等”和“良好”，国家考试成绩又为“优等”的学生，按照国家考试委员会的决定在毕业文凭上注明“成绩优等”。
    实行国家考试制度是为了更好地保证毕业学生的质量。高等学校学生在学完了教学计划所规定的全部理论课程和实习作业并且所有考试和考查都及格后，才能参加国家考试。毕业学生在国家考试时将按照所学专业的教学计划，进行指定课程的考试和毕业论文或毕业设计的答辩。国家考试不及格的学生或学习已经结业而不能如期提出毕业论文或毕业设计的学生，由国家先行分配工作；但是他们在结业后三年内可以向原学校申请再参加一次国家考试。
    国家考试由国家委托的国家考试委员会进行。国家考试委员会的主席一般的由校外教授或专家担任。
    高等教育部在五月十五日发出了高等学校国家考试条例草案。这个条例草案已经国务院批准。（新华社）
