Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 1st - TASS, Moscow reports: On April 30th, Moscow warmly welcomed Bulganin and Khrushchev upon their return from their visit to Britain.

After Bulganin and Khrushchev disembarked from the plane, a welcoming rally was held at the airport. Bobrovnikov, Chairman of the Moscow Soviet Executive Committee, delivered the opening remarks. Then, representatives of the Moscow working people, steelworker Ryabov and Academician Sobolev, spoke, expressing their deep satisfaction with the results of the Soviet leaders' visit to Britain.

Bulganin, amidst cheers, ascended the podium and spoke. Reviewing the Soviet leaders' visit and tour of Britain, he said: We went to Britain with sincere wishes. We had good direct contact with Mr. Eden and his colleagues, and met with British social activists and industrialists. Although we did not have the opportunity to have full contact with the British people, we are still convinced that the British people do not want war, they want peace, and they hope for friendly cooperation with the Soviet people. We also have a definite impression that British industrialists are in favor of developing economic cooperation and trade with the Soviet Union. All this had an impact on our talks with the British government. The outcome of the talks is certainly far from reaching an agreement on all issues, but it is important and fundamental for the development of relations between the two countries and for the cause of peace. Our talks have created new conditions for further improving Soviet-British relations. There are now wider possibilities for developing political and economic cooperation and for developing cultural and scientific ties. Both sides agreed that the basis of friendly cooperation is the peaceful coexistence of countries, regardless of their social systems.

Bulganin emphasized that our talks with the British government once again demonstrated that the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy has produced good results. The improvement of relations with Britain is not only the beginning of growing trust between our two countries, not only the beginning of a new stage in expanding ties and cooperation, it will also contribute to the common cause of peace and the development of good relations throughout the world.

Khrushchev also spoke at the meeting, and his speech was warmly welcomed.

Khrushchev said, we believe that this trip to Britain was very beneficial. During the talks, we exchanged opinions frankly. This enabled us to understand each other better, to clarify on which issues our views could converge, and to know when the timing for solving those issues was not yet ripe. By clarifying this, it is possible to find the issues on which we can reach an understanding. The outcome of this meeting once again proves that as long as there is sincerity, countries with different social systems can cooperate and coexist peacefully. It is a new stage on the road to further easing international tensions and an important step in the cause of establishing good international trust.

Khrushchev then spoke about the obstacles laid by certain powerful groups in the United States to easing international tensions. He said that, obviously, the conditions for abandoning the Cold War policy have not yet matured in the United States. However, we feel that even in the United States, there is already beginning to emerge a certain desire to establish mutual understanding. President Eisenhower's recent speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors proves this. We cannot agree with many of the arguments he made in his speech, no matter what. However, there were also some valuable things in his speech, saying that the United States is prepared to study all ways to resolve disputes, and that the Soviet government may be friendly to the United States. If both sides are sincere, we believe that many misunderstandings can be eliminated and Soviet-American relations can be improved. In the interests of the Soviet people, the American people, and the people of all other countries, it is necessary to create conditions for the widespread development of trade, cultural, and other ties between countries.

When talking about the Soviet Union's advocacy of establishing contact with socialist parties, Khrushchev mentioned the meeting between Soviet leaders and the leaders of the British Labour Party. At this meeting, some people in the Labour Party leadership group raised defamatory questions insisting that the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries were imprisoning certain social democrats, and these questions were resolutely refuted. Khrushchev emphasized that we advocate the unity of all ranks of the working class. Life has proven that wherever there is such unity, the struggle to win the vital interests of the working people achieves great success. Therefore, our party will continue to unremittingly strive for the unity of the working-class parties, especially on important issues that excite all working people, that is, the struggle to ease international tensions and defend peace. We are willing to disregard personal insults to us and the provocative attacks by some Labour Party leaders on the Soviet Communist Party, as long as the British Labour Party shows due understanding and willingness, we can disregard these and establish contact with them. It is clear that such contact is very important for the interests of the working people of Britain and the Soviet Union.

Academician Tupolev, aircraft designer, and Academician Kurchatov, physicist, also spoke on behalf of the delegation. They pointed out that British scientists, in their contacts with them, expressed great interest in and gave high praise to the achievements of Soviet science and technology.

Academician Kurchatov said, I saw that the Soviet Union has surpassed Britain in most aspects of atomic science and technology with a feeling of pride in the great people of the motherland and their science. But it must be pointed out that in some respects, the achievements of British physicists, chemists, and engineers are greater than ours. I was permitted by the Party and the government to report on some of the work that the Soviet Union is conducting in the field of controllable thermonuclear reactions at a meeting of British physicists. I am very honored that our government has demonstrated a noble initiative, and it was the first in the world to decide to make the secrets of this work public. This report was warmly welcomed by British scientists.

Finally, the assembly unanimously adopted a resolution expressing great satisfaction with the results of the visit and talks and heartily supporting the Soviet government's peaceful foreign policy.

During the meeting, millions of Soviet people listened to the live broadcast of the meeting through radio and television.

    在莫斯科中央机场举行的欢迎会上
　　布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫发表讲话
    新华社莫斯科1日电　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：四月三十日，莫斯科热烈地欢迎布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访问英国归来。
    当布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫下飞机以后，飞机场上举行了欢迎大会。莫斯科苏维埃执行委员会主席波布罗夫尼科夫致开会词。接着，莫斯科劳动人民的代表、炼钢工人里亚波夫和索波列夫院士讲了话，他们都对苏联领导人访问英国的结果表示深深的满意。
    布尔加宁在欢呼声中登上讲台讲话。他在回顾苏联领导人在英国访问和参观的情况时说：我们到英国去是怀着真诚的愿望的。我们同艾登先生和他的同僚进行了很好的直接接触，会见了英国的社会活动家和实业界人士。虽然我们没有机会和英国人民进行充分的接触，但是我们仍然坚信，英国人民不要战争，他们希望和平，希望同苏联人民友好合作。我们还有一个确定的印象，这就是英国实业界人士赞成发展同苏联的经济合作和贸易。这一切对我们同英国政府的会谈是有影响的。会谈结果离就全部问题达成协议当然还很远，但是它对发展两国关系以及对和平事业都是重要而带根本性的。我们的会谈为进一步改善苏英两国的关系创造了新的条件。在发展政治和经济合作、发展文化和科学联系方面，已经有了更广泛的可能。双方都同意，友好合作的基础是各国的和平共处，不管它们的社会制度怎样。
    布尔加宁强调说，我们同英国政府的会谈再一次表明，苏联的和平对外政策产生了良好的结果。同英国关系的改善不仅仅是我们两国间正在增长的信任的开端，不仅仅是扩大联系和合作的新阶段的开始，它还将有助于和平和在全世界发展良好关系这个共同事业。
    赫鲁晓夫也在会上讲了话，他的讲话受到了热烈的欢迎。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们认为，这次去英国是很有益的。在会谈期间，我们开诚布公地交换了意见。这使我们能够彼此更好地了解，弄清楚在那些问题上我们的观点可以接近，知道那些问题的解决时机尚未成熟。由于弄清楚这一点，就有可能找出我们能够取得谅解的问题。这次会谈的结果再一次证明，只要有诚意，不同社会制度的国家就能够合作和和平共处。它是进一步缓和国际紧张局势的道路上的一个新的阶段，是确定良好的国际信任的事业中的一个重要步骤。
    赫鲁晓夫接着谈到美国某些有势力集团对缓和国际紧张局势所布下的障碍。他说，显然，在美国，摈弃冷战政策的条件还没有成熟。但是，我们感觉到，就是在美国也已经开始显现出某种希望建立相互谅解的愿望。美国总统艾森豪威尔不久以前在美国报纸编辑协会的演说证明了这一点。我们对他在讲话里谈的许多论点无论怎样也是不能同意的。但是，在他的讲话里同时也有一些有价值的话，他说美国准备研究一切解决争执问题的办法，说苏联政府对美国可能是友好相待的。如果双方都有诚意，我们相信，许多误会是可以消除的，苏美关系是可以改善的。为了苏联人民、美国人民和其他一切国家的人民的利益，必须为广泛发展国与国之间的贸易、文化和其他联系创造条件。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到苏联主张同社会党建立接触的时候，提到了苏联领导人同英国工党领导人的会见。在这次会见中，工党领导集团中有些人提出了硬说苏联和人民民主国家监禁某些社会民主党人以及其他污蔑性的问题，这些问题都遭到了坚决的回击。赫鲁晓夫强调说，我们主张工人阶级的各种队伍的团结一致。生活证明，凡是有这种团结的地方，争取劳动人民的切身利益的斗争就取得巨大的成就。因此我们党将继续始终不懈地争取工人阶级政党的团结一致，特别是在激动着全体劳动人民的重要问题上，即争取缓和国际紧张局势和保卫和平的斗争上。我们愿意不计较对我们个人的侮辱和工党某些领导人对苏联共产党的挑衅性的攻击，只要英国工党表示了应有的了解和愿望，我们可以不理会这些而同他们建立联系。很清楚，这种联系对于英国和苏联劳动人民的利益都是很重要的。
    代表团团员、飞机设计师图波列夫院士和物理学家库尔查托夫院士也讲了话。他们指出，英国科学界人士在同他们接触当中，都对苏联科学和技术上的成就表示了很大的兴趣，并且给予了很高的评价。
    库尔查托夫院士说，我抱着以祖国的伟大人民和他们的科学而自豪的感情看到苏联在原子科学和技术方面大部分都超过了英国。但是必须指出，在某些方面，英国物理学家、化学家和工程师的成就比我们大。我得到党和政府的许可，在英国物理学家的会议上报告了苏联在可以操纵的热核子反应方面所进行的一些工作。我感到很荣幸，我国政府表现了崇高的主动精神，在全世界它最先决定公开这项工作的秘密。这个报告受到英国科学家的热烈欢迎。
    最后，大会一致通过了一项决议，表示非常满意这次访问和会谈的结果，并且衷心支持苏联政府的和平外交政策。
    在大会进行期间，千千万万的苏联人通过无线电收音机和电视机收听了大会的实况广播。
