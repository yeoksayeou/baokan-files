    Vigorously Carry Out Large-Scale Geological Prospecting Work
    The work done by China's geological departments in the past few years exceeds the work done in the entire half-century before liberation. In a short period of several years, the iron ore deposits in Daye and Baotou were explored, ensuring the construction of new iron and steel bases; many other ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, rare metals, and non-metallic minerals were found and verified, basically meeting the needs of industrial construction in the First Five-Year Plan. However, the geological prospecting work in the past few years has been mainly carried out around design projects, focusing on known producing areas. This policy was correct and successful at a time when technical strength was extremely weak, geological data were very insufficient, and construction requirements were extremely urgent. However, this approach also produced another result: preliminary surveys started relatively late, the scope was not wide enough, most areas still have unclear resource situations, and cannot fully meet the needs of national construction; too few types of minerals were explored, especially the exploration of some rare metals has not yet officially started, and cannot meet the diverse needs of national construction; the regional distribution of some proven mineral resources is also very uneven, and cannot meet the needs of a rational distribution of national industry.
    This inherent deficiency and inadequacy of geological work cannot but affect the capital construction of the First Five-Year Plan to a certain extent. For example, the construction projects of some coal mines are still in the situation of prospecting and shaft construction in the same year. In 1955, more than 60% of new well construction projects were based on mineral data explored in the same year, and in 1956, nearly one-third of new well construction projects still relied on exploration data in the same year for construction. This makes the arrangement of new well construction projects somewhat blind, often changing and postponing again and again. What is particularly serious is that due to the failure to explore the amount of ore or insufficient ore amount, some projects that the state originally planned to build have had to reduce the construction scale, postpone the construction time, or even temporarily stop construction.
    Now that the First Five-Year Plan has been implemented for the fourth year, and the construction projects of the Second Five-Year Plan are about to begin and be accelerated, geological work is urgently needed to prepare mineral reserves for the construction of the Second Five-Year Plan. Therefore, from the perspective of the country's next construction requirements, the lagging behind of geological work is even more serious. In particular, the state also needs the geological department to provide a large amount of reserve resources, so that when planning capital construction, it can choose from various comparisons, and can actively expand the construction scale at any time without being restricted by geological data. This task certainly requires considerable long-term efforts to solve. But it also requires the geological department to work harder and explore more mineral bases from now on.
    To meet the current and long-term needs of national construction, geological work must catch up at an extraordinary speed. This year, the state's prescribed geological prospecting tasks have increased unprecedentedly. The workload of the Ministry of Geology this year exceeds the total of the past three years. The geological prospecting tasks of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, and other units have also greatly increased. The tasks facing all geological prospectors are extremely arduous.
    In order to accomplish this task, in addition to continuing to strengthen exploration work, especially strengthening the exploration of highly promising mining areas such as iron ore in Gansu and Sichuan, and oil fields in Qinghai and Xinjiang, and striving to make correct conclusions in the shortest time and with the least cost, we must also use greater strength to carry out mineral surveys and regional geological mapping work. In the past few years, the geological department has not spent enough effort in this area. The amount of survey work of the Ministry of Geology from 1953 to 1954 accounted for only about 8% of the total workload, and although this situation changed in 1955, it still only accounted for about 20%; and whenever there was a conflict between tasks and strength, the survey tasks were usually squeezed. As for regional geological mapping, it has not even been formally carried out. Now, the more promising mining areas discovered and investigated in the decades before liberation have been explored in a few years. In order to find more mineral deposits, vigorously carrying out mineral surveys and regional geological mapping work is an urgent task; only in this way can new mineral resources be continuously discovered, and the backwardness of geological work can be fundamentally changed.
    With such arduous tasks, whether it is a survey team or an exploration team, they need to be careful and cautious, but also need to be bold and let go. If the task is heavy, running around the mountains and drilling everywhere will inevitably outweigh the gains; but being too restrictive and having too many concerns will also be difficult to achieve. From the current situation, since the geological department has emphasized exploration design, and to a large extent corrected the errors of once more serious blind exploration, there has begun to be a phenomenon of not being bold enough to let go of work. Some survey teams are afraid of being trapped in one place and not getting results. If they find minerals, they transfer to other places without further exposing the ore body. As a result, in addition to their notebooks, there are very few other materials, and they cannot make an accurate evaluation of these minerals. Some exploration teams are afraid of not seeing ore and causing waste, and dare not arrange more exploration work. They do not understand that it is certainly wrong to stubbornly cling to a location and drill randomly without any basis; however, geological work always has a certain degree of risk, and there will always be some drills that cannot produce anything, which is an inevitable phenomenon. It is impossible to require every drilling rig to hit ore with 100% accuracy, and it is also impossible to require that every exploration site will have mining value in the future; being afraid of not seeing ore and afraid of not having mining value does not dare to work, which is cutting off one's nose to spite one's face. Therefore, at present, while emphasizing scientific geological exploration work based on exploration design, it is also necessary to focus on opposing conservative thinking and advocating bold work.
    In order to complete the arduous geological prospecting tasks, the technical work of the geological department should be strengthened. The most important thing in this regard is to promote advanced experience and improve labor productivity. This year, the amount of core drilling work of the Ministry of Geology is 6702% of that in 1952. The task is very heavy, but the gap between advanced and backward in drilling work is very large, and the potential is extremely considerable. The Wang Guoji drilling rig of the 404 team of the Central South Geological Bureau broke the record of advancing one thousand meters per month. As long as a part of all the drilling rigs in the Ministry of Geology system reaches this level, the annual task will not be difficult to complete. Another equally important aspect of strengthening technical work is the adoption of new technologies, such as geophysical prospecting methods, aerial surveying methods, radioactive detection methods, and so on. Only by widely adopting these latest technologies can we raise China's geological prospecting work to a new level. Strengthening technical work requires technical equipment. At present, the supply of drilling rigs and various exploration equipment and instruments is extremely insufficient, which requires strong support from the machinery manufacturing sector.
    To complete the unprecedentedly arduous geological prospecting tasks, it is also necessary to strengthen scientific research work. This is an urgent problem for improving geological work, and it is also the most fundamental problem. Every step of geological work is inseparable from the guidance of scientific research work. The entire geological prospecting process is a process of guiding production practice with scientific research, and in turn, conducting scientific research on the data obtained in practice. Where to find ore needs to be based on the research of China's geological conditions; where to arrange the drilling network and how to arrange it needs to be based on the research of the geological conditions of this mining area; to make a final evaluation of a mine and determine whether it has mining value, it is even more necessary to conduct comprehensive scientific research on all the obtained data. Now the geological department has decided to improve the scientific research institutions and strengthen scientific research work in the survey team, exploration team, and other practical work links. This decision should be quickly implemented.
    Geological workers have been active in the field for a long time, and the local Party organizations and administrative leading organs should give special care to their material and cultural life. The state has stipulated certain field allowances for geological workers, but field allowances alone are not enough. The important issue is to ensure the supply of goods in kind, to enable them to have money to buy things nearby, to have vegetables to eat, and to have books and newspapers to read. It is also necessary to gradually establish rear bases for field personnel, so that they can have a place to stay nearby when they are on vacation, so that their children have a fixed place to study, and so that their material and cultural life can be better than it is now. The local Party organizations should also give special care to the political life of field geological personnel, strengthen the supervisory and guarantee role of the Party in the geological prospecting cause, and strengthen the political education of geological prospectors, so that they can better complete the arduous tasks entrusted to them by the Party and the state.

### 大规模地开展地质勘探工作

    大规模地开展地质勘探工作
    我国地质部门这几年所做的工作，超过了解放前整整半个世纪的工作量。在短短的几年中，探明了大冶和包头的铁矿，保证了新的钢铁基地的建设；找到和证实了不少其他黑色金属、有色金属、稀有金属和非金属矿产，基本上满足了第一个五年计划中工业建设的需要。但是，过去几年来的地质勘探工作基本上是围绕着设计项目，在已知产地有重点地进行的。这种方针，在当时技术力量极其薄弱、地质资料十分不足、建设要求又异常迫切的情况下是正确的，也是有成绩的。然而，这种作法也产生了另一种结果，这就是：普查工作开始得比较晚，面铺得不宽，多数地区依然是资源情况不明，不能完全满足国家建设的需要；勘探的矿种太少，特别是某些稀有金属的勘探工作还没有正式开始，不能满足国家建设多方面的需要；已经探明的某些矿产资源的地区分布也很不平衡，不能满足国家工业合理分布的需要。
    地质工作这种先天不足和捉襟见肘的状况，不能不使第一个五年计划的基本建设受到一定的影响。例如有些煤矿的建设工程至今仍处在当年勘探、当年建井的情况中。1955年有60％以上的新井建设项目是依靠当年勘探的矿产资料进行的，1956年仍有将近三分之一的新井建设项目要依靠当年的勘探资料进行建设。这就使得新井建设项目的安排带有一定的盲目性，常常是一再改变，一再推迟。特别严重的是由于没有勘探出矿量或矿量不足，还使得国家预定要建设的某些工程不得不缩小建设规模，推迟建设时间，甚至暂时停止建设。
    现在，第一个五年计划已经执行到第四年，第二个五年计划的建设项目也要开始和加紧设计了，急需地质工作为第二个五年计划的建设准备矿产储量。因此从国家下一步的建设要求来看，地质工作落后的情况就更加显得严重。特别是国家还需要地质部门提供大量的后备资源，以便在规划基本建设的时候，可以从多方面的比较中选择，并且可以随时主动地扩大建设规模，不致受地质资料的限制。这个任务固然需要相当长期的努力才能解决。但也要求地质部门更加努力，从现在起就勘探出更多的矿产基地来。
    适应国家建设当前的和长远的需要，地质工作必须以超过寻常的速度赶上去。今年国家规定的地质勘探任务空前增加，地质部今年的工作量超过过去三年的总和，冶金工业部、煤炭工业部、石油工业部等单位的地质勘探任务也大大增加了。摆在全体地质勘探人员面前的任务是极其繁重的。
    为了完成这个任务，除了必须继续加强勘探工作，特别是加强诸如甘肃和四川的铁矿、青海和新疆的油田等极有希望的矿区的勘探工作，力求以最短的时间、最少的费用作出正确的结论之外，还必须以更大的力量来开展矿产普查和区域地质测量工作。过去几年中，地质部门在这方面花的力量是不够的。地质部1953年至1954年的普查工作量仅占全部工作量的8％左右，1955年虽然改变了这种情况，但仍只占20％左右；而且每逢任务和力量发生矛盾，通常都是把普查任务挤小了。至于区域地质测量，甚至还没有正式进行过。现在，解放前几十年间发现的和调查过的比较有希望的矿区，已在几年的时间内勘探完了，为了寻找更多的矿藏，大力开展矿产普查和区域地质测量工作，已是一项刻不容缓的任务；只有这样才能不断地发现新的矿产资源，从根本上改变地质工作的落后面貌。
    任务这样繁重，无论是普查队、或者是勘探队，都需要小心谨慎，也需要大胆放手。任务重了，就满山乱跑、到处打钻必然得不偿失；但束手束脚、顾虑太多也难有收获。从目前情况看，地质部门中自从强调了勘探设计，在很大程度上纠正了曾经比较严重的盲目勘探的错误之后，又开始产生不够大胆放手工作的现象。有的普查队怕陷在一个地方，得不到结果，发现了矿产也不进一步揭露矿体就转移到别的地方去。结果，除了他们的笔记本外，别的资料很少，不能对这些矿产作出确切的评价。有的勘探队怕见不到矿，造成浪费，也不敢布置更多的勘探工作。他们不了解，毫无根据地死抓住一个地点，胡乱打钻，固然不对；但是，地质工作总有一定程度的冒险性，总会有一些钻打不出东西来，这倒是不可避免的现象。决不可能要求每一部钻机都百发百中地见矿，也不可能要求每一个勘探的地点将来都有开采价值；怕见不到矿，怕没有开采价值就不敢工作，这是因噎废食。因此，目前在强调根据勘探设计、科学地进行地质勘探工作的同时，也必须着重地反对保守思想，提倡大胆工作。
    为了完成繁重的地质勘探任务，应该加强地质部门的技术工作。在这方面最重要的是推广先进经验，提高劳动生产率。今年地质部的岩心钻探工作量为1952年的6702％，任务很重，但钻探工作中先进同落后的悬殊很大，潜力是极其可观的。中南地质局404队的王国骥钻机突破了月进一千公尺的纪录。地质部系统的全部钻机，只要有一部分达到这个水平，全年的任务就不难完成。加强技术工作中另一个同样重要的方面是采用新技术，例如地球物理探矿的方法，航空测量的方法，放射性探测的方法等等。只有广泛采用这些最新的技术，才能把我国的地质勘探工作提高到一个新的水平上来。加强技术工作需要技术装备。目前，钻机和各种勘探器材、仪器的供应极感不足，这就需要机械制造部门大力支援。
    要完成空前繁重的地质勘探任务，还必须加强科学研究工作，这是改进地质工作的迫切问题，也是最根本的问题。地质工作的每一步都离不开科学研究工作的指导，整个地质勘探的过程就是以科学研究指导生产实践，反过来又对实践中所获得的资料进行科学研究的过程。到哪里找矿，需要以对我国地质情况的研究作为依据；在哪里布置钻探网，怎样布置，需要以对于这个矿区地质情况的研究作依据；对一个矿作最后评价，确定有没有开采价值，更需要对所获得的全部资料作综合的科学研究。现在地质部门已经决定要健全科学研究机构，在普查队、勘探队和其他各个实际工作环节中，加强科学研究工作。这个决定应该迅速地贯彻执行。
    地质工作人员长期在野外活动，地方党组织和行政领导机关对他们的物质生活和文化生活，应当特别关怀。国家已经给地质工作人员规定了一定的野外津贴，但仅仅有野外津贴是不够的，重要的问题在于保证实物供应，在于使他们有钱能就近买到东西，能有蔬菜吃，有图书报纸看。还需要逐步建立起野外人员的后方基地，使他们休假的时候能就近有个落脚点，使他们的子女有一个固定的读书的地方，使他们的物质生活和文化生活能够比现在过得好一些。对野外地质人员的政治生活，地方党组织同样要给以特别的关怀，要加强党在地质勘探事业中的监督保证作用，加强对地质勘探人员的政治教育，让他们更好地完成党和国家委托给他们的艰巨任务。
