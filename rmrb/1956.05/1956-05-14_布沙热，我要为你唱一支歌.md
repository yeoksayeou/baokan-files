Bushara, I want to sing a song for you, a song for the Uyghur girls who are just like you.

When I picked up my pen, I suddenly remembered the spring of 1952. On a clear day, I went with a general I respected to Water Mill Gully from Urumqi. At that time, the factory buildings of the "July 1st" Cotton Textile Mill had just been completed, and some textile machines had just been installed in the workshop. A group of female workers from Shanghai and Qingdao were test-driving them.

After the visit, I asked, "Why are there no Uyghur female workers in this factory?"

The general raised his right hand, clenched it into a fist, and kept shaking it in front of his eyes—this was his habitual action. He said, "There will be soon. There definitely will be." His tone was so affirmative and confident, like giving an order in battle, that one could not help but be convinced.

At that time, we looked at each other and smiled...

Today, in the spring of 1956, in this blooming Beihai Park, I saw you—Bushara, do you know? When I shook hands with you, I was so excited! Because I saw on your chest, the black corduroy set off two glittering medals, how dazzling the medals of advanced producers! I was so excited because I saw the first batch of Uyghur female textile workers grow up, and I saw the brilliance of our Party's national policy.

Bushara, how happy you are! You are only eighteen years old this year, and your name is already on the list of national advanced producers.

On the oases of the Tianshan Mountains, I have confided in many people as old as your mother, Hatemkhan. They cried to me with tears and snot, complaining about the misfortunes they suffered in the old society. At that time, women were not treated as human beings, women were sold like livestock, women could not freely walk out of the gate, and women spent their days swallowing tears.

But you, Bushara, are a person of another society. Your family was allocated land during the land reform, and last winter you joined an agricultural production cooperative. Your mother's mind opened up and her eyes brightened during the social reform movement. She loves you. As you said, "My mother doesn't want me to taste even a bit of the pain she suffered." Your brother, Rouzi Ahong, an activist in the land reform, is now a Communist Party member and serves as a village clerk. Your sister, Ayzimu, had already put on the red scarf. You, on the other hand, are already a glorious member of the Communist Youth League. I know that in the distant Xinjiang, on the scattered oases and the boundless grasslands, there are many, many happy families like yours, and many, many happy girls like you.

In 1954, you graduated from senior primary school. Just then, the "July 1st" Textile Mill sent people to Kashgar to recruit female workers. A new life, a life of labor, was calling you. You applied for the exam and were admitted. Now, the social atmosphere has changed. On your path of rapid advancement, there are no more of the many obstacles that your mother suffered in her youth. Many people in the village went to your house to congratulate your mother, congratulating her on giving birth to such a capable daughter. Your whole family was overjoyed.

Early winter arrived. When the leaves fell, you, a girl who grew up drinking the water of the Kashgar River, and dozens of sisters of similar age, boarded cars and flew to Urumqi.

On the eve of your departure, you slept beside your mother. She stroked your head, repeatedly urging and instructing you. She said, "You must study hard! Weave cloth so that your mother can wear it." Perhaps because of this, although there were tears in her eyes, they did not flow out. You also smiled through tears. Early the next morning, when your brother sent you to the car, he only said one sentence: "Listen to the Party and work hard!" A girl like you understands the weight of this sentence.

On November 21st, you arrived in Urumqi. Han female workers warmly welcomed you. They helped you tidy up your room, fetch water and start a fire for you, and asked you about your well-being. You said, "I feel like I'm back home." Bushara! Your feeling is not wrong at all.

After more than a month of study, on a day in late December, you were assigned to the workshop. You became a member of the second weft yarn group of Class B. A new life officially unfolded before you.

You told me about your feelings when you first entered the workshop. You said, "At that time, my hands were tightly grasping my clothes, and I was so surprised that I could hardly breathe. I wanted to say something to my companions, but the roar of the machine drowned out my voice. Oh! Such a wide room, such bright long windows, so many machines and workers. It's really strange, in a while, cotton rolls turned into thin threads, and the machine wove a long section of cloth. The machine weaves more in a day than my mother can weave by hand in a year? I thought, I also want to use these machines, I was extremely happy. Then I thought, how can I learn to use it? I couldn't help but feel scared." For a girl from the countryside, all of this would naturally surprise and please you. However, for a girl with a stubborn will, all of this would not make you afraid for long.

At night, in the dormitory, the girls who came with you from Kashgar started discussing. Some said timidly, "It would be good to master these machines within half a year." Some were even a bit pessimistic: "I'm afraid I won't be able to operate it even after a year of learning." Bushara! What were you thinking lying on the bed without saying a word? At that time, you were only sixteen years old. How could a sixteen-year-old child suffer from insomnia? But you couldn't sleep well for several nights in a row. At this moment, your brother wrote to you. His words of encouragement were still the same: "Listen to the Party and work hard!" Thinking, thinking, you suddenly figured it out. You said to your companions, Jiamila Mu and Aminaimu, "As long as we study hard, with the care of the Party and the help of the Han sisters, we will quickly learn to operate the machines. What is there to be afraid of?" Your words encouraged yourself and everyone. Everyone praised you for saying it right. You agreed that whoever learns to use the machine first will help everyone.

At first, you followed the Han female worker Yu Conglian as an apprentice. She took care of you meticulously, telling you the name of this part and the performance of that part, wishing she could take out her heart and give it to you. You were so humble and serious. How she taught, how you learned; how she said, how you did. When you encountered something you didn't understand, you asked again and again until you understood. Sometimes, because of the language barrier, you communicated with gestures. You followed behind her, imitating her movements over and over again. You said you liked Yu Conglian from the bottom of your heart, and regarded her as your own big sister. In fact, this Han female worker from Qingdao was only two or three years older than you, and she was still a young girl who had not been away from home for long! It was the Party's national policy and the common ideals of young people that united you closely like sisters.

You are a smart girl. Nine days later, you began to independently manage two hundred spindles.

Managing spindles is not a simple task. Especially for girls like you who have just put on work clothes, managing spindles is very laborious. In the first few days, the spindles seemed to be deliberately making trouble for you. Either this yarn broke, or that yarn broke. You ran back and forth, connecting and connecting, running non-stop, never finishing. At that time, how anxious you were! Yu Conglian had come through such a difficult road. She knew how much you needed spiritual encouragement and technical help at such a time. She often said to you, "Persist! There is no difficulty in the world that cannot be overcome. You have to persevere and strive to be a Uyghur Hao Jianxiu." She told you that you should concentrate your attention as soon as you enter the workshop and be calm. If you find that the yarn breaks frequently, you should immediately check the machine.

Since then, you have become much calmer. Whenever some yarn breaks, you would whisper to yourself, "Bushara! Be quiet, be quiet." Then you would calmly connect each yarn end one by one. If you encounter a machine that frequently breaks yarn, you would also whisper to yourself, "Bushara! Why does it always break? What is the reason?" Then you would calmly check each gear, wipe it clean, and oil it.

Twenty-three days later, you went from managing two hundred spindles to managing four hundred and sixty-four spindles. You are always enthusiastic about all new things. When the workshop promoted new methods such as forward roving lapping, or suction cotton debonding, you always overcame all difficulties, actively learned, and conscientiously implemented them. You moved forward with everyone, and walked ahead of everyone. The knots you spliced were very small; the average time to change roving was twenty-two seconds per piece, and there were no breaks; the leather roller flower rate was also reduced by an average of 0.17 percentage points compared to the standard. Thanks to your own efforts, you became an advanced worker among the first batch of Uyghur female textile workers. In just one year, you have gone from managing four hundred and sixty-four spindles to managing six hundred and ninety-six spindles. Your companions are watching you. Every step you take forward adds a point of confidence to them, and they quickly catch up. Now, whether it is Jiamila Mu or Aminaimu, they are also managing six hundred spindles. Bushara! Have you ever realized the role you have played in production?

You told me that you love your spinning machine very much, and even the regular whirring sound it makes sounds moving to you. You feel lonely in your heart if you don't hear it singing for a day. Because of this, from the first day you walked into the workshop, you have not asked for leave once, have not been late or left early once, and have never been absent from work once. Like your mother loves you, you love your machine and wipe it until it is spotless. When measuring the results, your cleaning work scored eighty-five points. You said, "I like to be clean myself, and my machine likes to be clean like me." No! Bushara! You didn't say it completely. It should be said that you are dressing yourself up, making the machine as beautiful as yourself. No wonder your companions want to take your shift, saying that you clean according to the chart every time, preparing it for the next shift.

Han female workers warmly help you. You not only learn their skills, but also learn their spirit of helping others. You always remember your promise: "Whoever learns to use the machine first will help everyone." Mohetermu is from Kuche. She is younger than you and came later than you. When this rural girl first came, she couldn't get used to the collective life of the factory, and she had a child's playful heart, so she had been absent from work. You talked to her once and again. You said to her, "We Uyghurs have textile factories for the first time, and we work in this factory, so we can't ruin the reputation of Uyghur girls." You also found that she was not interested in her work because she didn't understand the machine and didn't understand the technology. So you often used the time of eating and stopping the car to patiently teach her some of the skills you had just learned, making her love her work. Now, Mohetermu can independently manage four hundred spindles, and has never been absent from work or late or left early again.

That day, in the conversation, I asked you, "What force is encouraging you to do so many outstanding things?"

You answered so loudly. You said, "The first is the Party, the second is the Party, and the third is still the Party." Then, you whispered that you are working hard to strive to join the Party! Bushara! No matter how low you press your voice, you can't suppress your surging mood. This is what your grateful eyes and joyful voice tell me.

I also asked about your future aspirations.

You said, "I want to study technology hard, strive to manage eight hundred spindles, or even more spindles, and ensure that the quality is good. What about later? I will do whatever the Party tells me to do."

I said, "If the Party asks for your opinion and asks you: Bushara, what do you want to do?"

You smiled. You said, "Then I will say to the Party, let me stay and work in the textile factory!"

Your answer is very simple, but also very moving. You belong to a new generation of people. You were raised by the Party's milk. Your relationship with the Party cannot but be so closely related and flesh and blood!

Writing here, I am very excited. I want to thank our great Party's national policy, which has enabled ethnic minorities to gradually move towards de facto equality. I want to thank the general I respect, who is now leading a large army, running on another construction front. The "July 1st" Cotton Textile Mill was established under his initiative. I want to thank Yu Conglian and her companions, who traveled across mountains and rivers to the border of the motherland, and used their technology and enthusiasm to cultivate the first batch of Uyghur female textile workers.

Bushara, when we parted in Beihai Park, I pointed to the blooming lilac flowers and congratulated you: "In the sunshine of spring, your life will be as blooming as this lilac flower."

You didn't speak, but lowered your head slightly and closed your eyes halfway. At this time, I saw that your eyelashes were so long, like two rows of stretched stamens. From your girlish shyness, I could feel the longing and joy for future happiness surging in your heart.

But, Bushara, you are still very young. There are also Jiamila Mu, Aminaimu and many, many Uyghur girls! Your life has just begun. Your future is infinitely bright. Your happiness will be a song that can never be finished. (Attached picture)

    布沙热，我要为你唱一支歌
    闻捷
    布沙热，我要为你唱一支歌，为那些和你一样的维吾尔姑娘唱一支歌。
    当我拿起笔来的时候，忽然想起1952年的春天，在一个晴朗的日子，我和一位我所敬爱的将军，从乌鲁木齐到水磨沟去。那时，“七一”棉纺织厂的厂房竣工不久，车间里刚安装起一部分纺织机器，一群来自上海和青岛的女工正在试车。
    参观以后，我曾问过：“这个厂怎么没有维吾尔族女工呢？”
    将军抬起右手，捏成拳头，在眼前不住地晃动——这是他的习惯动作。他说：“不久就会有的。一定会有的。”他的声调那样肯定和自信，像作战的时候下达命令一样，令人不能不信服。
    当时，我们相视着笑了……
    今天，1956年的春天，在这百花盛开的北海公园里，我看到了你——布沙热，你知道吗？当我和你握手的时候，我是多么的激动啊！因为我看到在你的胸前，那黑色的灯芯绒衬出两枚金光闪闪的奖章，多么耀眼的先进生产者的奖章呵！我之所以如此激动，还因为我看到维吾尔民族的第一批纺织女工成长起来了，我看到了我们党的民族政策的光辉。
    布沙热，你是多么幸福呵！你今年才十八岁，你的名字就已经列入全国先进生产者的名册了。
    在天山南北的绿洲上，我曾经和许多像你妈妈哈特木汗那样年岁的人谈过心。她们一把眼泪一把鼻涕地向我哭诉，哭诉自己在旧社会遭受的不幸。那时候啊，女人不被当做人看待，女人像牲口一样被出卖，女人不能自由地走出大门，女人整日吞饮着眼泪过生活。
    而你，布沙热，却是另一个社会的人。你的家庭在土地改革的时候分到了土地，去年冬天又参加了农业生产合作社。你的妈妈在社会改革运动中，头脑开了，眼睛亮了。她爱你。正如你说的：“妈妈不愿把她自己受过的痛苦，再让我尝受一点。”你的哥哥肉孜阿洪，土地改革中的积极分子，现在成了共产党员，担负着乡文书的工作。你的妹妹阿依孜木，早就带上了红领巾。你呢，已经是一个光荣的青年团员。我知道，在遥远的新疆，那星罗棋布的绿洲上，一望无际的草原上，有着许许多多你们这样幸福的家庭，有着许许多多你这样幸福的姑娘。
    1954年你在高小毕业了。正在这时，“七一”纺织厂派人到喀什噶尔招考女工。新的生活，劳动的生活召唤着你。你报名投考后被录取了。现在，社会的风气变了。在你大步前进的道路上，再没有妈妈年轻时代所遭受的重重阻碍了。村子里有很多人到你家里去，向你妈妈祝贺，祝贺她生了一个多么能干的女儿。你们一家人都乐得合不拢嘴来。
    初冬到了。树叶子飘落的时候，你这个喝喀什噶尔河水长大的姑娘，和几十个年岁相仿的姐姐妹妹们，分乘着汽车，向乌鲁木齐飞驶而去。
    临走的前夕，你睡在妈妈的身旁。她抚摸着你的头，千叮
  咛，万嘱咐。她说：“你要好好学本事啊！织出布来，也好叫妈妈穿一穿。”正因为这样吧，她的眼眶里虽然有泪花打转，却没有流出来。你也含着泪笑了。第二天一早，你哥哥送你上车的时候，只说了一句话：“听党的话，好好干！”像你这样的姑娘，是懂得这句话的分量的。
    十一月二十一日，你们到了乌鲁木齐。汉族女工亲切地接待你们。她们帮你们收拾房间，给你们打水生火，问寒问暖。你说：“我好像回到了家里。”布沙热！你的感觉一点也不错。
    经过一个多月的学习，在十二月底的一天，你们被分配到车间去。你成为乙班第二纬纱组的一员。新的生活正式在你面前展开了。
    你告诉我你第一次走进车间的心情。你说：“那时候，我的两手紧紧抓着衣襟，惊奇得几乎喘不过气来。我想要和同伴们说点什么，机器的吼叫压倒了我的喉咙。哎呀！那么宽大的房间，那么明亮的长窗，那么多的机器和工人。真奇怪，一会工夫，棉花卷就转成了细线，机器就织出很长一截布来。机器织一天，恐怕比妈妈用手织一年还要多呢？我想，我也要使用这些机器了，心里高兴极了。我又一想，我怎么才能学会使用它呢？心里由不得害怕起来。”对于一个来自农村的姑娘，这一切自然会使你惊奇和高兴。不过，对于一个意志倔强的姑娘，这一切又不会使你长久害怕下去。
    晚上，在宿舍里，和你一同从喀什噶尔来的姑娘们议论开了。有人心虚地说：“半年内能够掌握这些机器，就不错了。”有人甚至有点悲观：“就怕学一年也使唤不动它。”布沙热！你一言不发地躺在床上想什么呢？那时，你才十六岁。十六岁的孩子那里会失眠呢？可是你却一连好几个夜晚不能好好的安睡。就在这个时候，你哥哥来信了。他勉励你的话还是那样一句：“听党的话，好好干！”你想着、想着，忽然想通了。你和你的同伴加米拉木、阿米乃木说：“只要我们好好学习，有党的关照，有汉族大姐的帮助，我们会很快地学会操纵机器的。有什么值得害怕的呢？”你的话鼓舞了自己，也鼓舞了大家。大家都称赞你说得对。你们约定：谁先学会使用机器，谁就来帮助大家。
    开始你跟着汉族女工于从莲当徒工。她对你关照得无微不至，一会告诉你这个机件的名字，一会告诉你那个机件的性能，恨不得把心掏出来给你。你是那样的虚心和认真。她怎么教，你怎么学；她怎么说，你怎么做。遇到不懂的地方，你就一问再问，直到明白为止。有时因为语言的隔阂，你们就用手式交谈，你跟在她的背后，按照她的动作比划过来，比划过去。你说你从心眼里喜欢于从莲，把她当成自己的大姐。其实，这位来自青岛的汉族女工，只不过比你大两三岁，也还是一个离开家庭不久的年轻姑娘哩！是党的民族政策和年轻人的共同理想，把你们像姐妹一样紧紧地团结在一起了。
    你是一个聪明的姑娘。九天以后，你就开始独自看管二百个锭子了。
    看管锭子是一件并不简单的工作。特别对于像你一样刚刚穿上工作服的姑娘，看管锭子是很吃力的。在最初的几天，锭子好像专门和你作对，不是这根细纱断了头，就是那根细纱断了头。你跑来跑去，接来接去，跑不停，接不完。当时，你心里是多么的焦躁啊！于从莲是从这样艰苦的道路上走过来的。她知道，在这样的时候，你是多么需要精神上的鼓舞，又多么需要技术上的帮助。她不时地对你说：“坚持下去！人间没有什么不可克服的困难。你要坚持，争取做维吾尔族的郝建秀。”她告诉你，一走进车间就要集中自己的注意力，做到心平气静。如果发现细纱经常断头，就应当马上检查机器。
    从此，你变得沉着多了。每当有些细纱断了头的时候，你会低声地告诉自己：“布沙热！安静一点，安静一点。”然后从容地一一把纱头接上。如果遇到那部机器上经常发生细纱断头的现象，你也会低声地询问自己：“布沙热！它为什么老是断头呢？原因在那里呢？”然后冷静地检查每一个齿轮，擦净它，给它上油。
    二十三天以后，你就从看管二百个锭子提高到看管四百六十四个锭子了。你对一切新鲜事物总是兴致勃勃。在车间推广粗纱顺向包拈镶头、或是吸棉器解拈接头等新方法时，你总是克服一切困难，积极学习，认真执行。你和大家一同前进，又走在大家的前头。你接的纱头疙瘩很小；换粗纱平均每只二十二秒，并且做到不断头；皮辊花率也平均比规定标准降低了百分之零点一七。由于你自己的努力，你成了维吾尔民族第一批纺织女工中的先进者。在短短的一年内，你又从看管四百六十四个锭子，提高到看管六百九十六个锭子了。你的同伴们看着你。你前进一步，就给她们增添一分信心，她们也就飞快地追赶上来。现在，无论是加米拉木，或者是阿米乃木，也都看管到六百个锭子了。布沙热！你在生产中所起的这种作用，你曾经意识到了吗？
    你对我说，你很爱你的纺纱机，连它发出的有规律的嗖嗖声，听起来都是动人的。你一天不听见它歌唱，心里就感到寂寞。正因为如此，从你第一天走进车间起，一年多来没有请过一次假，没有迟到早退过一次，更没有旷过一次工。像妈妈爱你一样，你爱自己的机器，把它擦得雪亮。测定成绩的时候，你的清洁工作得到了八十五分。你说：“我自己很爱干净，我的机器也和我一样爱干净。”不！布沙热！你说得不完全。应当这样说，你是在打扮自己，把机器打扮得和自己一样漂亮。难怪你的同伴们都想接你的班，说你每次都按照图表进行清洁工作，为下一班做好了准备。
    汉族女工热情地帮助你。你不仅学习她们的技术，而且学习她们帮助别人的精神。你始终记着你们的诺言：“谁先学会使用机器，谁就来帮助大家。”莫合特热木是从库车来的。她的年龄比你小，来的时间比你晚。这位农村姑娘刚来的时候，过不惯工厂的集体生活，而且有着孩子贪玩的心，曾经发生旷工的现象。你就一次再次地和她谈心。你对她说：“我们维吾尔人第一次有了纺织厂，我们在这个厂子里工作，不能毁坏了维吾尔姑娘的名声。”你还发现她对工作不感兴趣，是因为不懂机器，不懂技术。于是你就经常利用吃饭停车的时间，把自己刚刚学到的一些技术，耐心地教给她，使她热爱起自己的工作。现在，莫合特热木已经能独自看管四百个锭子了，再也没有旷工或迟到早退。
    那天，在谈话中，我曾问你：“是什么力量鼓舞着你做了这么多出色的事情呢？”
    你回答得那样响亮。你说：“第一个是党，第二个是党，第三个还是党。”然后，你轻声地告诉我说，你正在为争取入党而努力呢！布沙热！不管你把嗓子压得多么低，你却无法压抑自己激荡的心情。这是你那充满感激的眼睛和充满喜悦的声音告诉我的。
    我还问到你将来的志愿。
    你说：“我要好好学习技术，争取看管八百个锭子，以至更多的锭子，并且都要保证质量良好。以后呢？党叫我干什么，我就干什么。”
    我说：“如果党来征求你的意见。问你：布沙热，你愿意干什么呢？”
    你笑了。你说：“那我就对党说，还是把我留在纺织厂工作吧！”
    你回答得很简单，却又回答得很动人。你是属于新的一代的人。你是党的乳汁所喂养大的。你和党的关系，不能不是这样息息相关、血肉相连啊！
    写到这里，我很激动。我要感谢我们伟大的党的民族政策，使得少数民族人民逐渐走向事实上的平等。我要感谢那位我所敬爱的将军，他现在正率领着一支大军，奔走在另一个建设阵地上，“七一”棉纺织厂就是在他的倡议下建立起来的。我要感谢于从莲和她的同伴们，是她们跋山涉水来到祖国的边疆，以她们的技术和热情，培养出维吾尔民族的第一批纺织女工。
    布沙热，我们在北海公园分手的时候，我曾指着盛开的丁香花向你祝贺：“在春天的阳光下，你的生命将会像这棵丁香花一样，越开越盛。”
    你没有讲话，却微微地低下头，半闭起眼睛。这时，我才看到你的睫毛是那样的长，仿佛两排伸展的花蕊一般。从你那少女所特有的羞涩姿态里，我感觉得出，你胸中激荡着对于未来幸福的向往和欢乐。
    但是，布沙热，你还很年轻。还有加米拉木、阿米乃木以及许许多多的维吾尔姑娘们！你们的生活才刚刚开始。你们的前程无限远大。你们的幸福将是一支永远唱不完的歌。（附图片）
