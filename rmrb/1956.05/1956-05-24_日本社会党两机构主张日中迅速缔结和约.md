Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd. The Japan Socialist Party's Foreign Policy Committee and International Bureau held a joint meeting today, deciding that the attitude towards China should be: the Japanese government should promptly start negotiations with China to conclude a peace treaty including principles such as equality and mutual benefit, and non-aggression, in order to establish normal diplomatic relations with China. The meeting considered that the Chinese government has already established a consolidated and unshakable regime on the Chinese mainland.

At today's meeting discussing the recognition of China, the two organs also decided to request the Japanese government to conclude agreements on issues such as the repatriation of detained Japanese citizens and trade, fisheries, technology, and cultural exchanges, and to seek the mutual establishment of government representative offices.

On the other hand, the joint meeting maintained that because the Chinese government's rule has not yet reached the Taiwan area, Japan should continue to maintain its current relationship with the Chiang Kai-shek group. The meeting hoped that the major relevant countries would seek a peaceful resolution to the issue of international tensions centered on Taiwan.

The above-mentioned plan of the Socialist Party's Foreign Policy Committee and International Bureau regarding the attitude towards China, jointly decided, will be submitted to the Socialist Party Central Committee meeting to be held at the end of May for approval. After approval, the Socialist Party will submit to the Diet a "Resolution on the Normalization of Diplomatic Relations with China."

    日本社会党两机构主张日中迅速缔结和约
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：日本社会党外交政策委员会和国际局在今天举行联席会议，决定对中国的态度是：日本政府应该迅速同中国开始谈判，缔结包括平等互利、互不侵犯等原则的和约，以同中国建立正常的邦交。会议认为，中国政府已经在中国大陆上建立了巩固的不可动摇的政权。
    在今天讨论承认中国问题的会议上，两个机构还决定要求日本政府就遣返被拘留的日本人和贸易、渔业、技术、文化交流等问题缔结协定，并且谋求互设政府代表机构。
    另一方面，联席会议却主张，因为中国政府的统治目前还没有达到台湾地区，所以日本同蒋介石集团继续保持目前的关系。会议希望主要的有关国家对以台湾为中心的国际紧张局势问题求得和平解决。
    社会党外交政策委员会和国际局联合决定的上述对中国态度的方案，将提交在五月底举行的社会党中央委员会会议批准。在批准以后，社会党将向国会提出“关于同中国邦交正常化的决议案”。
