Soviet Youth Responding to the Motherland's Call
By Our Correspondent in the Soviet Union, Li He

The call of the motherland is stirring the hearts of hundreds of thousands of Soviet youth, who are preparing to set off for Siberia, the Far East, and Kazakhstan, to the North and the Donbass, to participate in the construction of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, to create new enterprises and cities, and to accept the tempering of difficulties.

Two years ago, when the Soviet Party and government called for the reclamation of virgin lands, the young workers of the Moscow Stalin Automobile Factory were the first to respond. Nearly two hundred young volunteers set off for the Altai Territory, where they reclaimed new land and founded the "Harvest" State Farm. Now, among the young workers of this factory, the volunteer spirit to go to the places needed by the state is once again active. Radichinko is preparing to go to the Far East with his wife, Elizaveta, a student at the Teachers College. He said, "This trip will be a strong spiritual test for me and my family."

Youth workers in many factories in Moscow held rallies one after another. At these meetings, people expressed their love for the motherland. Kolosova, a weaving worker at the Izmail Textile Factory, said, "For us Youth League members, nothing is more important or glorious than completing the Party's tasks. Please register me on the list of those departing on the first train. My companion, shuttle winder Kulagina, will go with me."

Applications describing their aspirations and cultural and technical levels are flooding into youth league organizations and newspaper editorial departments in various places. A letter from fifty-five boys and girls in two classes of the tenth grade of the Sixth Middle School in the North Ossetian Autonomous Republic of the Caucasus stated: "We clearly know what kind of difficulties we will encounter: unfamiliar conditions, severe cold climate. But this has not scared us, but rather attracted us. Life is a creative pursuit, a victory achieved at the cost of human spirit and physical strength." They appealed to all tenth-grade students in the Soviet Union to go to the eastern regions.

Go to the East! This is the voice of the Soviet Party and government, and it has immediately become the highest aspiration of all Soviet youth today. A group of plasterers in Leningrad, including Belov, who applied to go east, shouted: "The distant frontier will soon become our homeland. Future comrades, welcome the people from Leningrad." Dozens of young workers at the Rostov Agricultural Machinery Factory have already submitted their volunteer applications. They are inheriting the fighting spirit of going to the front during the war. They said, "We will work in the new places in such a way that the Lenin Communist Youth League will receive its fifth order."

In the face of the new patriotic movement, the Central Committee of the All-Union Lenin Communist Youth League requires youth league organizations at all levels to use congresses, newspapers, and talks to publicize the calls of the Soviet Party and government well to the youth, to explain the labor and living conditions in the new places, and the Central Committee entrusts youth league committees at all levels to carefully select qualified youth, and instructs the youth league committees in the eastern regions and other places to organize a warm welcome and arrangement for the young patriots together with the administrations of enterprises and construction sites.

Soviet youth are preparing to set off. Dolmatovsky composed a poem in "Pravda" to praise this event.

The youth are preparing to set off,
Soviet-style vigor and vitality
Match the steps of the young Five-Year Plan,
We go to the East and the North.

Volunteers, friends, patriots,
Sons of the elder generation of Youth League members,
In those boundless places of the motherland,
How much boiling life is waiting for us!

Let the thatched shed be the first dwelling,
To later grow up into a city—
We do not seek easy paths,
Let us perform meritorious service, always ready.

Now from the signs of the spirit,
We see the omens of communism.
We make our motherland shine brightly,
We add beauty to the earth.

Those who are proud of the title of "Builder,"
Will also find happiness and glory.
The Party can rely on its youth,
The people can rely on their youth.

    响应祖国号召的苏联青年
    本报驻苏联记者　李何
    祖国的号召激荡着成千成万苏联青年的心，他们准备上路，到西伯利亚、远东和哈萨克斯坦去，到北方和顿巴斯去，去参加第六个五年计划的建设，去开创新的企业和城市，去接受困难的磨炼。
    两年前当苏联党和政府号召开垦荒地时候，莫斯科斯大林汽车工厂的青年工人们首先起来响应。近二百名青年志愿者出发到阿尔泰边疆去，在那里开垦了新地，创立了“丰收”国营农场。现在，在这个工厂的青年工人们当中，又活跃起到国家所需要的地方去的志愿。拉狄钦科准备和他的妻子——师范学院女学生叶利查维塔一起到远东去。他说：“此行对我和我的家庭是一个坚强的精神的考验。”
    莫斯科许多工厂的青年工人们纷纷举行大会。在这些会上，人们发抒了爱祖国的热情。伊兹迈尔纺织厂织布女工科洛索娃说：“对于我们青年团员，没有什么比完成党的任务更重要、更光荣的了。请将我登记在乘第一列车出发的名单中。我的同伴——装梭女工库拉金娜和我一道去。”
    叙述自己的志愿和文化与技术水平的申请书，潮水一般涌进各地共青团的组织和报纸编辑部。高加索北奥塞梯自治共和国第六中学第十年级两班五十五个男女学生的信里说：“我们清楚地知道，我们将遭遇什么样的困难：不习惯的条件，严寒的气候。但这没有吓倒我们，反而吸引了我们。生活是创造性的追求，用人的精神和体力的代价所取得的胜利。”他们向全苏联十年级学生呼吁到东部地区去。
    到东部去！这是苏联党和政府的声音，它立即成为全苏联青年今天最高的愿望。列宁格勒一批申请东去的泥水工人白洛夫等高呼：“辽远的边疆很快就成为我们的乡土，未来的同伴们，迎接列宁格勒的来人吧。”罗斯托夫农业机器制造厂已经有几十名青年工人递上志愿书。他们继承着在战时上前线的战斗精神。他们说：“在新的地方我们将这样工作，使得列宁共产主义青年团获得第五个勋章。”
    在新的爱国主义运动面前，全苏列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会要求各级青年团组织通过大会、报刊和谈话，向青年们很好地宣传苏联党和政府的号召，解释新地方的劳动和生活的条件，团中央委托各级团委会仔细地挑选合格的青年，责成东部等地团委会同企业和工地的行政一起组织对青年爱国者的热情的迎接和安排。
    苏联青年准备上路了。多尔马托夫斯基在“真理报”作诗歌颂这件事。
    青年准备上路，
    苏维埃式的生龙活虎
    合着年轻的五年计划的脚步，
    我们去东部跟北部。
    志愿者们，朋友们，爱国者们，
    共青团员前辈的儿子们，
    在祖国那些无边广阔的地方，
    多少沸腾的生活在等着我们！
    让草棚当作初宿的住所，
    到后来成长起来城市——
    我们不寻找轻便的道路，
    立功吧，随时准备。
    如今从精神的标志上，
    我们看到共产主义的征兆。
    我们使我们祖国光辉普照，
    我们给大地增添美貌。
    以“建设者”的称号自豪的人，
    也将找到幸福和荣耀。
    党可以依靠自己的青年，
    人民可以把自己的青年依靠。
