Most agricultural cooperatives in Guangxi Province have formulated advanced production plans.

The work of rectifying agricultural production cooperatives in Guangxi Province, combined with spring plowing, has basically concluded in early May.

This cooperative rectification work began around the Spring Festival. At present, among the nearly 10,000 fully socialist agricultural cooperatives in the province, the vast majority have formulated advanced and reliable production plans. 98% have implemented the "three fixed" system (fixed production teams, fixed cultivation areas, and fixed cattle and farm implements). More than 9,000 cooperatives have promoted seasonal and graded labor quota management and over-quota reward systems, and more than 7,000 cooperatives have implemented a system of fixed investment and output quotas within production teams. The labor efficiency of cooperative members has significantly improved.

Therefore, this year's spring plowing production in Guangxi Province has developed considerably compared to last year. The irrigation area of water conservancy projects repaired in the province this spring is more than three times the irrigation area for the entire year last year. By the end of April, afforestation had reached more than 15.6 million mu, equivalent to seven times the afforestation for the entire year last year. The average fertilizer application on the province's 16 million mu of early rice fields is more than 5,000 jin per mu, and almost all of the nearly 8 million mu of early rice that has now been transplanted uses small-plant dense planting. 60% of the several million mu of vigorously growing spring corn is densely planted in double rows and single plants. In addition, agricultural cooperatives in various regions have specially trained more than 160,000 farmer technicians in agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and other fields. These measures have laid a reliable foundation for completing the province's agricultural production increase plan for this year. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　广西大多数农业合作社制定先进生产计划
    广西省结合春耕进行的整顿农业生产合作社工作，已在五月初基本结束。
    这次整社工作从春节前后开始。目前全省近一万个全社会主义的农业社中，绝大多数都制定了先进而又可靠的生产计划，有98％实行了三固定（生产队、耕作区、耕牛和农具）的制度，有九千多个社推行了分季分等劳动定额管理和超额奖励制，有七千多个社在生产队里实行了定资（投资）包产制。社员们的劳动效率有了显著提高。
    因此，广西省今年的春耕生产比去年有了长足的发展。全省春修水利工程的灌溉面积，比去年全年的灌溉面积多三倍以上。到四月底，各地造林已经达到一千五百六十多万亩，相当于去年全年造林的七倍。全省一千六百万亩早稻田，平均每亩有肥料五千多斤，现在已插下的近八百万亩早稻，几乎全部采用了小株密植。几百万亩生长茂盛的春玉米，有60％是双行单株密植。此外，各地农业合作社还专门训练了十六万多名农业、林业、水利等各方面的农民技术员。这些措施给完成今年全省的农业增产计划打下了可靠的基础。　（据新华社讯）
