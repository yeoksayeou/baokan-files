　　The Joy of Labor
　　Shadi Pulatuowa, Weaver at the Tashkent Textile United Factory in the Soviet Union, Deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek Republic
    I work at the Tashkent Textile United Factory. This factory is one of the largest enterprises in the Soviet Union. Its products are very famous in the Soviet Union. In the socialist competition, our factory always stands in the ranks of advanced enterprises in the republic. We completed the 1955 plan on December 22nd last year, and overproduced approximately two million meters of cloth. The plan for the first quarter of this year has been successfully completed, with an overproduction of approximately 300,000 meters of cloth.
    I came to this factory in 1942. Our country was in a difficult period during the war. At that time, many workers in the factory went to the front lines and took up arms to defend their beloved motherland. Their wives, sisters, and younger brothers went to replace them. I could not stand idly by in the common cause, so I decided to participate in production. It was there that I understood the joy of working for the benefit of the motherland and the people.
    I didn't have any expertise, so for the first month, I persevered in learning weaving work next to the loom. Later, I began to work independently, initially managing six looms, then twelve. But I felt that this was not the limit. Many weavers manage eighteen to twenty-four looms, and I thought, why shouldn't I strive to be like them?
    I carefully observed the work of experienced weavers and discussed with the team leader how to better organize my labor. This had a positive impact on my subsequent work. After a year, I was already managing eighteen looms, and later twenty-four.
    Years passed. I constantly improved my work methods and strived to complete the plan not only in quantity but also in quality.
    On July 25, 1955, I completed my five-year plan task. In five years, I overproduced approximately 12,000 meters of cotton cloth. To welcome the festival of peace and labor—"May Day"—I proposed the task of overfulfilling the monthly plan and made my words a reality. All the cloth I wove was of first-class quality. In the first quarter of this year, my labor productivity has increased. In 1955, each of the twenty-four looms I managed produced 3.15 meters of cloth per hour, while now it is 3.25 meters.
    Dear Chinese friends! I am honored to come to your beautiful country to attend the Chinese National Advanced Producers Representative Conference. I sincerely congratulate the conference participants on their fruitful work and wish all the workers of great China great achievements in socialist construction.

　　劳动的快乐
　　苏联塔什干纺织联合工厂织布女工  乌兹别克共和国最高苏维埃代表  沙蒂·普拉托娃
    我在塔什干纺织联合工厂工作。这个工厂是苏联最大的企业之一。它的产品在苏联是很驰名的。在社会主义竞赛中，我们工厂总是站在共和国先进企业的行列。我们在去年十二月二十二日完成了1955年的计划，并且超计划生产了大约二百万公尺布。今年第一季度的计划已经胜利完成，超计划生产了大约三十万公尺布。
    我是在1942年到这个工厂的。我国在战争期间是艰苦的。那时工厂中的许多工人上了前线，拿起武器捍卫自己亲爱的祖国。他们的妻子、姐妹和弟弟去接替他们。我也不能对共同的事业袖手旁观，因而决定参加生产。我在那里懂得了为造福祖国和人民而劳动的快乐。
    我没有任何专长，因此，头一个月我一直是在织机旁边坚持不懈地学习织布工作。以后开始独立工作，最初是管六台织布机，接着是管十二台。但是我觉得这并不是极限。许多织布女工是管十八台到二十四台织机，我想，我为什么不努力做到也跟她们一样呢？
    我留心观察了有经验的织布女工的工作，并且同组长商量怎样更好地组织自己的劳动。这对我以后的工作有良好影响。过了一年，我已经是管十八台织机，以后是二十四台了。
    几年过去了。我不断地改善了自己的工作方法，努力设法不仅在数量上，而且在质量上完成计划。
    1955年7月25日我完成了自己的五年计划任务。我在五年当中超任务生产了大约一万二千公尺棉布。为了迎接和平和劳动的节日——“五一”，我提出了超额完成月计划的任务，并且使自己的话兑了现。我织的布全是一级品。今年第一季度，我的劳动生产率提高了。在1955年，我管的二十四台织机每台每小时出3.15公尺布，而现在是3.25公尺。
    亲爱的中国朋友们！我很荣幸地来到你们美丽的国家，出席中国全国先进生产者代表会议。我衷心地祝贺会议参加者的富有成效的工作，并祝贺伟大中国的全体劳动者在社会主义建设中取得巨大的成绩。
