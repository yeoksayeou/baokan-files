Collaborative relationships should be reasonable

When determining the collaborative relationships between enterprises, attention should be paid to the distance between regions. If a factory on the banks of the Songhua River relies on a factory on the banks of the Jialing River to supply semi-finished products, then on the one hand, because the journey is long and transportation is inconvenient, it not only wastes transportation costs but also cannot guarantee timely supply. On the other hand, because of fear of untimely supply, it is necessary to increase reserves, resulting in the accumulation of excessive funds. This situation is obviously unreasonable.

However, this situation often occurs. Some of the steel needed by the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is supplied by Chongqing 102 Steel Plant; some collaborative products are trial-produced and supplied by some factories in East China. For example, the asbestos friction plates required for automobiles are supplied by the plastic workshop of the Nanjing Automobile Parts Factory. Now this plastic workshop is to be moved to Chengdu. In the future, thousands of tons of asbestos friction plates will have to be transported from Chengdu to Changchun. This not only increases transportation costs but also cannot guarantee the needs of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant's assembly line production.

The competent departments of factories with collaborative tasks should seriously study the issue of enterprise collaboration, make comprehensive plans, reasonably allocate collaborative tasks, and try to shorten the geographical distance between collaborative factories.

    协作关系要合理
    在确定各个企业协作关系的时候，要注意地区的远近。如果一个在松花江畔的工厂要靠一个远在嘉陵江边的工厂供应半成品，那末，一方面因为路途遥远、运输不便，既浪费运输费用，又不能保证供应及时。另方面因为害怕供应不及时，不得不增加储备量，积压过多的资金。这种情况，显然是不合理的。
    但是，这种情况常常有。第一汽车制造厂需要的钢材，有些是重庆一○二钢厂供应的；有些协作产品，是由华东的一些工厂试制和供应的。例如：汽车所需要的石棉摩擦片，是靠南京汽车制配厂塑胶车间供应的。现在这个塑胶车间要迁往成都。将来上千吨的石棉摩擦片，要由成都运到长春。这样既增加运输费用，又不能保证第一汽车制造厂流水式的大量生产的需要。
    有协作任务的工厂的主管部门，要认真研究企业协作问题，做出全面规划，合理分配协作任务，尽量缩短协作工厂的地区上的距离。
