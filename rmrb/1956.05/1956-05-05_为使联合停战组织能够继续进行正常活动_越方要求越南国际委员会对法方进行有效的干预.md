    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 4th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Vietnam People's Army side requested the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Vietnam to intervene effectively so that the Geneva Accords and other agreements signed by both parties would be respected and fully implemented, and that the Joint Armistice Organizations responsible for ensuring the implementation of the Geneva Accords would be able to continue their normal activities. This was proposed by Phan Trong Tue, Chief Delegate of the Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army to the Central Joint Armistice Commission, in a letter to the International Commission on April 28.
    The letter stated that the statements made by the delegation of the General Command of the French Union Forces at the meeting of the Central Joint Armistice Commission on April 26, and the statement of the delegation of the French side stationed in the Demilitarized Zone Joint Armistice Commission on April 27, not only did not mention the continued fulfillment of the Geneva Accords on Vietnam and other agreements signed by both parties by the French government and the South Vietnamese authorities, but also unilaterally withdrew its delegations stationed in the Joint Armistice Commissions, thereby openly disintegrating these Joint Armistice Organizations. The letter pointed out that this was a serious action aimed at undermining the legal basis of the Geneva Accords. The French side must bear full responsibility for all possible adverse consequences.
    The letter emphasized that despite the withdrawal of French troops from South Vietnam and the dissolution of the General Command of the French Union Forces, the French government and the South Vietnamese authorities must still send their representatives to the Central Joint Armistice Commission to conduct normal activities.

    为使联合停战组织能够继续进行正常活动
　　越方要求越南国际委员会对法方进行有效的干预
    新华社河内4日电　据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军方面要求越南国际监督和监察委员会进行有效的干预，以使日内瓦协定和协定双方签订的其他协议得到尊重和充分的履行，并且使负责保证日内瓦协定的履行的联合停战组织能够继续进行正常活动。这是越南中央联合停战委员会越南人民军总司令部代表团首席代表潘重慧少将在四月二十八日写给国际委员会的信中提出的。
    这封信说，法兰西联邦部队总司令部代表团在中央联合停战委员会四月二十六日的会议上的声明和法方驻非军事区联合停战委员会的代表团四月二十七日的声明，不但都没有谈到法国政府和南越当局继续履行关于越南的日内瓦协定和双方签订的其他协议的责任，而且都擅自撤退了它驻联合停战委员会的代表团，从而公然瓦解了这些联合停战组织。信中指出，这是一个以破坏日内瓦协定的法律基础为目的的严重行动。法方必须对一切可能产生的不利后果负全部责任。
    信中强调说，尽管法军撤出南越和法兰西联邦部队总司令部解散，法国政府和南越当局仍然必须派遣它们的代表前来中央联合停战委员会进行正常活动。
