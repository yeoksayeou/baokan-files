In a speech at the National Conference of Advanced Producers Representatives on the 3rd, Bo Yibo, Director of the Third Office of the State Council, pointed out that rapidly improving cultural levels and actively mastering new technologies are the main ways to promote the advancement of the advanced producer movement.

Bo Yibo said that at present, the cultural and technical level of our country's workers is still quite backward, and the scientific and technical theoretical level of engineering and technical personnel is also not high compared with the world's advanced technical level. In order to rapidly improve our country's industrial technology level and strive to basically reach or approach the world's advanced level in the main aspects of our industrial technology within twelve years, we must march towards science. Therefore, he said, it is necessary to strengthen the regular and after-work cultural and technical studies of employees, and strengthen technical research and scientific experiments. It is necessary to learn from all beneficial experiences from the Soviet Union, people's democratic countries, and capitalist countries that are applicable to our country. He said that it is foolish not to learn from international advanced experiences, but it is also wrong to not attach importance to summarizing and promoting our own experiences.

In his speech today, Bo Yibo also described the remarkable achievements our country has made in industrial construction over the past three years and the current situation.

He said that in 1955, the national output of pig iron was 3.62 million tons, 1.9 times that of 1952; the output of steel was 2.85 million tons, twice that of 1952; the output of coal was 93.17 million tons, 1.5 times that of 1952, exceeding the highest annual coal output in our country's history by 50%; the national power generation was 12.1 billion kilowatt-hours, 1.7 times that of 1952; the total output value of machines and machinery produced by the First Ministry of Machine Building was 2.4 times that of 1952; cement was 4.5 million tons, 1.6 times that of 1952; and sulfur was 320,000 tons, 1.8 times that of 1952.

He said that after three years of efforts, many products that our country could not manufacture in the past have now been successfully trial-produced, such as seamless steel pipes, silicon steel sheets, aluminum ingots, aluminum materials, heavy steel rails weighing 43 to 50 kilograms per meter, imitation Soviet Yak-18 trainers, 600-ton iron mixing furnaces, 6,000-kilowatt steam power generation equipment, 10,000-kilowatt hydroelectric power generation equipment, imitation Soviet Stalin No. 6 grain combine harvesters, Democratic No. 10 freighters, imitation Soviet Donbass Type I combined coal miners, and so on. Automobiles, airplanes, tractors, etc., which we increasingly expect to be able to produce ourselves, will also be successfully trial-produced soon and will soon be put into production.

He said that under the call of the CPC Central Committee for socialist construction to be more, faster, better, and more economical, a new upsurge has also been triggered in industrial construction. It is expected that the production and capital construction plans for the development of the national economy in 1956 will greatly exceed the original targets for 1956 in the Five-Year Plan. Capital construction in 1956 will increase by 68% compared with 1955; the production of various heavy industrial departments in 1956, calculated by total output value, will exceed the targets for 1957 stipulated in the Five-Year Plan, except for the coal industry and the power industry. The output of major products, except for crude oil, raw coal, and power generation, such as pig iron, steel, steel products, metal cutting machine tools, steam turbines, electric motors, transformers, locomotives and rolling stock, civilian ships, cement, double-wheel double-share plows, bicycles, etc., will all reach or exceed the targets for the last year stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan.

He said that the arrival of the socialist upsurge in industrial construction is primarily due to the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee. As long as we carefully examine the actual situation, everyone should admit that whether it is from the perspective of equipment utilization rate, or from the perspective of saving raw materials, especially from the perspective of the workers' ever-increasing enthusiasm for socialist construction, our potential is still very large. The CPC Central Committee has grasped this basic situation in our work, concentrated all the positive factors in our work, concentrated many reasonable demands and voices from the masses, and put forward the call to oppose right-leaning conservative thinking and make industrial construction more, faster, better, and more economical. This call was immediately supported by the workers and turned into their own action program. Old quotas are constantly being broken, and new records are constantly emerging. For example, the working hour quotas for major products of enterprises under the First Ministry of Machine Building have been reduced by an average of 15% to 30%. The Second Ministry of Machine Building had already reached the production level stipulated in the Five-Year Plan for 1957 by the end of January this year, that is, it completed the production level stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan one year and eleven months ahead of schedule. Various technical and economic indicators of the Ministry of Power Industry in 1956 can also reach or exceed the level stipulated in the Five-Year Plan for 1957. The Ministry of Coal Industry can complete this year's design tasks ahead of schedule, with eleven pairs of new wells being started ahead of schedule, and twenty-eight pairs of mines being transferred to production ahead of schedule. The Ministry of Heavy Industry has greatly increased labor productivity by systematically promoting many new technologies and advanced experiences.

After analyzing the characteristics and development laws of the advanced producer movement in his speech, Bo Yibo criticized the conservative thinking and bureaucratic style of some enterprise leaders in the advanced producer movement. He said that all enterprise leaders should resolutely lead, organize, and support the advanced producer movement. Some enterprise leaders often put the accumulation of funds for building socialism and the interests of the country in opposition to the planned and gradual increase of wages and improvement of the people's lives, as if national wealth must mean popular poverty, and popular wealth cannot mean national wealth. This is wrong. If you are truly concerned about the collective interests of the country, concerned about accumulating more funds for socialist construction, and running more socialist undertakings, then you should better care about the vital interests of the workers. Because only in this way can we return to further improve labor productivity, accumulate more socialist construction funds, and run more socialist undertakings.

He said that there are also some enterprise leaders who just follow behind the masses, and advocate everything the masses propose without discrimination, even taking the violation of operating procedures by individual masses as a good way to "break the rules" and adopting it, resulting in serious consequences of waste, reduced quality, and personal accidents; also, because they dare not boldly lead the movement and guide the enthusiasm of the masses in a correct direction, they have promised some things that are currently impossible or inappropriate to advocate, but then cannot do them, which in turn undermines the emotions of the masses. We know that more, faster, better, and more economical are closely linked, and we must take into account both needs and possibilities. More and faster must be developed on the basis of better and more economical. In industrial construction, "better" means improving our work in all aspects, learning and mastering new technologies, and improving the quality of products and projects. "More economical" means practicing strict economy, implementing economic accounting, saving raw materials, fully utilizing the effectiveness of equipment, and increasing labor productivity to accumulate more funds for the country. Therefore, while striving for more and faster, we must pay attention to better and more economical. We must strive for more and faster on the premise of better and more economical. Increasing variety and improving quality are very important tasks in the current industrial construction.

In his speech, Bo Yibo finally pointed out that our achievements in socialist construction in the past few years are very great, and our progress is also very rapid, but we must never be complacent because of this. He encouraged all advanced producers and advanced workers to guard against arrogance and impetuosity, be cautious and humble, study hard, work diligently, and strive to achieve greater achievements in the great cause of building the motherland.

### 迅速提高文化水平，积极掌握新技术  薄一波在全国先进生产者代表会议上的讲话

　　迅速提高文化水平，积极掌握新技术
    薄一波在全国先进生产者代表会议上的讲话
    国务院第三办公室主任薄一波三日在全国先进生产者代表会议上的讲话中指出：迅速地提高文化水平，积极地掌握新技术，是使先进生产者运动向前发展的主要途径。
    薄一波说，目前我国工人的文化技术水平还是相当落后的，工程技术人员的科学技术理论水平，比起世界先进技术水平来也是不高的。为了迅速地提高我国的工业技术水平，争取在十二年内使我国工业技术的主要方面，基本上达到或接近世界的先进水平，我们必须向科学进军。因此，他说，要加强职工的正规的、业余的文化技术学习，加强技术研究和科学试验等工作。要学习苏联的、人民民主国家的以及资本主义国家的一切有益的在我国适用的经验。他说，不学习国际的先进经验是愚蠢的，但不重视总结和推广自己的经验也是错误的。
    薄一波在今天的讲话中，还讲述了三年来我国在工业建设上获得的显著成就和目前的情况。
    他说，1955年，全国生铁的产量是三百六十二万吨，为1952年的一点九倍；钢的产量是二百八十五万吨，为1952年的两倍；煤炭的产量是九千三百一十七万吨，为1952年的一点五倍，超过我国历史上煤炭最高年产量50％；全国发电量是一百二十一亿度，为1952年的一点七倍；第一机械工业部生产的机器机械总产值，为1952年的二点四倍；水泥是四百五十万吨，为1952年的一点六倍；硫?是三十二万吨，为1952年的一点八倍。
    他说，经过三年来的努力，我国过去不能制造的许多产品，有些现在已经试制成功了，比如无缝钢管、矽钢片、铝锭、铝材、每公尺四十三公斤到五十公斤的重钢轨、仿苏雅克一十八式教练机、六百吨的混铁炉、六千瓩的蒸汽发电设备、一万瓩的水力发电设备、仿苏斯大林六号式的谷物联合收割机、民主十号货轮，仿苏顿巴斯一型式的联合采煤机等等。我们所日益期望能够自己生产的汽车、飞机、拖拉机等，也即将试制成功，不久就可投入生产。
    他说，在中共中央关于社会主义建设要又多、又快、又好、又省的号召下，工业建设也引起了新的高潮。预计1956年发展国民经济的生产和基本建设计划，都将大大地超过五年计划中原订的1956年的指标。1956年的基本建设，将比1955年增长68％；重工业各部门1956年的生产按总产值来计算，除煤炭工业和电力工业以外，都将超过五年计划中所规定的1957年的指标。主要产品的产量，除原油、原煤、发电量以外，其它如生铁、钢、钢材、金属切削机床、汽轮机、电动机、变压器、机车车辆、民用船舶、水泥、双轮双铧犁、自行车等，都将达到或者超过第一个五年计划所规定的最后一年的指标。
    他说，工业建设的社会主义高潮的到来，首先是由于中共中央的正确领导。只要我们认真地检查一下实际情况，谁都应当承认，无论从设备利用率方面来看，或者从节约原材料方面来看，特别是从工人日益增长的社会主义建设的积极性方面来看，我们的潜力还是很大的。中共中央抓住了我们工作中的这一基本情况，集中了我们工作中的一切积极因素，集中了许多来自群众的合理的要求和呼声，提出了反对右倾保守思想，把工业建设做得又多、又快、又好、又省的号召，这一号召，立即获得了工人群众的拥护，变成了工人群众自己的行动纲领。旧的定额不断地被打破，新的纪录不断地在出现。如第一机械工业部所属企业主要产品的工时定额平均降低了15％到30％。第二机械工业部今年一月底就已经达到五年计划所规定的1957年的生产水平，即提前一年又十一个月完成了第一个五年计划所规定的生产水平。电力工业部1956年各种技术经济指标也都可以达到或者超过五年计划所规定的1957年的水平。煤炭工业部今年的设计任务可以提前完成，有十一对新井可以提前施工，二十八对矿井可以提前移交生产。重工业部由于系统地推广了许多新技术和先进经验，使劳动生产率大大提高。
    薄一波在讲话中分析了先进生产者运动的特点和发展规律后，批判了某些企业的领导人员在先进生产者运动中所存在的保守思想和官僚主义作风。他说，一切企业领导者，都应该坚决地领导、组织和支持先进生产者运动。有些企业领导者，往往把积累建设社会主义的资金、把国家的利益同有计划地逐步地提高工资和改善群众生活对立起来，好像国富就必须民穷，民富就不能国富，这是错误的。如果你真正是关心国家的集体利益，关心积累更多的社会主义建设资金，兴办更多的社会主义事业，那你就应当更好地关心工人群众的切身利益。因为只有这样，才能返回来更进一步地提高劳动生产率，就可以更多地积累社会主义建设资金，兴办更多的社会主义事业。
    他说，还有一些企业的领导者，他们只是跟在群众后面跑，凡是群众提出的，不加选择一概加以提倡，甚至把个别群众的违反操作规程，也当做是“打破常规”的好办法，加以采纳，结果是引起了浪费、质量降低和人身事故的严重恶果；还有，由于不敢大胆地去领导运动，把群众的积极性引向一个正确的方向，使一些目前不可能做到或不适当提倡的事情，也答应了，结果又做不到，返回来又打击了群众的情绪。我们知道，又多、又快、又好、又省是密切结合着的，要照顾到需要，同时又要照顾到可能，多、快必须是在好、省的基础上发展。在工业建设中，“好”就是要改进我们各方面的工作，学习和掌握新的技术，提高产品和工程的质量。“省”就是要厉行节约，贯彻经济核算，节省原材料，充分利用设备的使用效能，提高劳动生产率，为国家积累更多的资金。所以在争取又多、又快的同时，必须注意又好、又省。必须是在好、省的前提下来争取又多、又快。增加品种、提高质量，是当前工业建设中一项非常重要的任务。
    薄一波在讲话中最后指出，几年来我们在社会主义建设上的成绩是很大的，我们的进步也是很快的，但是我们决不能因此而自满起来。他勉励全体先进生产者和先进工作者要戒骄戒躁，谨慎谦虚，努力学习，埋头苦干，争取在建设祖国的伟大事业中取得更大的成就。
