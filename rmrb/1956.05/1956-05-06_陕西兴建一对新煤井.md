Shaanxi to Build a Pair of New Coal Mines

A pair of large-scale new mines in the Shaanxi area—the Tongchuan Taoyuan Adit—officially commenced construction on May 3rd.

The designed capacity of this new type of mine is half again as large as the Northwest's first pair of new vertical shafts, the Sanlidong Vertical Shafts. During the construction and future coal mining of this mine, all mechanical operations will replace heavy manual labor. For example, during construction, all excavation will be done using pneumatic picks and drills, and during coal mining, all combined coal mining machines will be used. Transportation will use electric locomotives, endless rope equipment, and other equipment. The Fourth Well Construction Team of the Tongchuan Engineering Office of the Xi'an Coal Mine Basic Construction Bureau, which is responsible for the construction of the mine, has decided to adopt the advanced experience of multi-cycle parallel operations and multi-heading excavation for well construction. In the first half of 1958, this pair of mines can be put into production. (Gao Shengming)

    陕西兴建一对新煤井
    陕西地区一对规模巨大的新矿井——铜川桃园平洞，在五月三日正式开工兴建。
    这对新型矿井的设计能力，比西北第一对新竖井三里洞竖井还要大一半。这个矿井在建设和将来采煤的过程中，都将全部用机械操作代替笨重的体力劳动。如施工中，全部采用风镐、风钻掘进，采煤时将全部用联合采煤机，运输中用电机车、无极绳等设备。担任矿井建设任务的西安煤矿基本建设局铜川工程处第四建井队，决定采用多循环平行作业和多头掘进法的先进经验建井。1958年上半年，这对矿井可以投入生产。（高生明）
