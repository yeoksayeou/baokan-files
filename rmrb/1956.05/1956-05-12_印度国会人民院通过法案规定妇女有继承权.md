Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 10th - The Indian Lok Sabha has passed the Hindu Inheritance Bill, which stipulates inheritance rights for women.

    Prime Minister Nehru, in his speech to the Lok Sabha, criticized those who opposed the bill and demanded the continuation of the traditional inheritance system that deprived women of property rights. He said that the fate of Indian women today is not good, and that it is not the fault of the women but the fault of the social structure. He also emphasized that India's progress will largely depend on the women of India.

    Those who opposed this bill included some members of the Congress Party, in addition to other members. All the female members of the Lok Sabha wholeheartedly supported the bill.

    The bill, passed by the Lok Sabha on May 8th, was originally proposed on December 12th during the previous session of the Lok Sabha. Parliament resumed discussion of the bill on April 27th. The bill will now be returned to the Rajya Sabha, along with the amendments passed by the Lok Sabha, for discussion and passage. The Rajya Sabha had previously passed the bill.

    印度国会人民院通过法案规定妇女有继承权
    新华社新德里10日电　印度国会人民院通过了规定妇女有继承权的印度教徒继承法案。
    尼赫鲁总理在人民院发言中，批评那些反对这项法案而要求继续保持剥夺妇女的财产权的那种传统的继承制度的人们。他说，今天印度妇女的命运是不好的，那不是妇女的过错而是社会结构的过错。他还强调指出，印度的进步在很大程度上将依靠印度的妇女。
    反对这项法案的人，除了其他议员以外也包括一些国大党的议员。人民院所有女议员都衷心地支持这项法案。
    人民院五月八日通过的这项法案是在去年十二月十二日在人民院前届会议期间提出来的。国会在四月二十七日恢复了关于这项法案的讨论。现在这项法案将同人民院所通过的修正案一起交回联邦院讨论通过。在这以前，联邦院曾经通过这项法案。
