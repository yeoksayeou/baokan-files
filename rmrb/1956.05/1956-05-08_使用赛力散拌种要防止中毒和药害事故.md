To the Editor:

　　Using Ceresan for seed treatment can prevent crops from contracting diseases due to seed-borne pathogens and also prevent certain soil-borne diseases. However, this pesticide is a toxic agent made with mercury, and the dosage varies for different crops. If the dosage is too low, the effect will be minimal; if the dosage is too high, it will cause crop damage. Attention must also be paid to the operating methods when using this pesticide. If the pesticide is not mixed evenly when treating the seeds, it will affect the efficacy. Furthermore, if safety precautions are not taken during seed treatment, it can lead to poisoning accidents for humans and animals.

　　Recently, the Guanyintang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the East Suburb District of Beijing used Ceresan to treat 100 mu of millet seeds, with the prescribed dosage being 0.3% of the seed weight. However, the cooperative's statistician mistakenly thought it was 3%, resulting in a tenfold increase in the dosage, which prevented the 100 mu of millet from germinating. In Anyang and Tangyin, Henan Province, there have already been 11 poisoning accidents this year during Ceresan seed treatment. One person died in Daizhuang Village, Tangyin County, as a result. The main causes of poisoning were excessive dosage and failure to change personnel and shifts on time and wear masks as required during operation.

　　Currently, various localities are carrying out spring sowing and seed treatment work. Agricultural departments must educate agricultural production cooperatives to pay attention to safety precautions when using Ceresan to strictly prevent poisoning accidents for humans and animals and crop damage accidents. Agricultural technology extension stations and farms in various localities should also dispatch personnel to go deep into the cooperatives to provide guidance and inspection.

    使用赛力散拌种要防止中毒和药害事故
　　编辑同志：
    用赛力散拌种，可以使作物不因为种子附菌而传染病害，还可以防止某些土壤传染的病害。但是，这种农药是用水银制造的有毒药剂，各种农作物的用药量不同，如果用量过少，效果就不大；如果用量过多，又会发生药害。这种农药在使用时还必须注意操作方法，如果用药拌种不均匀，会影响药效；如果拌种时不注意安全防护工作，更会发生人畜中毒事故。
    最近，北京市东郊区观音堂农业生产合作社用赛力散拌种谷子（小米）一百亩，规定赛力散用量是种子重量的0.3％；但是这个社的统计员却误为3％，结果用药量增加了十倍，使一百亩谷子不能发芽。河南省安阳、汤阴在今年使用赛力散拌种中已发生中毒事故十一起，汤阴县代庄村因此死亡一人；中毒原因主要是用药量过大，在操作的时候又没有按照规定时间换人换班和戴好口罩。
    现在各地正在进行春播拌种工作，农业部门必须教育农业生产合作社在使用赛力散时注意安全防护工作，严格防止人畜中毒事故和农作物药害事故。各地农业技术推广站和农场也应抽派力量，深入各社指导检查。  周全中
