    The "Japanese Film Week" will be held from June 13th to 29th in ten cities.

    During this film week, Chinese audiences will be able to see five Japanese films including "Street Without Sun," "For Love's Sake," "Here is a Spring," "Women in the War," and "Twenty-Four Eyes."

    "Street Without Sun" is adapted from the novel of the same name by Tokunaga Sunao and focuses on the strike movement of workers at the largest printing factory in Tokyo thirty years ago; the other films are all based on the lives of Japanese people during and after World War II.

    The cities that will host the "Japanese Film Week" are Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, Harbin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, and Urumqi.

    A delegation of Japanese filmmakers will be invited to visit China during the film week.
