One of the major changes brought about by the high tide of agricultural cooperativization in rural areas is that a large number of rural women are increasingly participating in major agricultural labor. In the winter of last year and the spring of this year, women engaged in various agricultural and sideline production in Shandong Province accounted for nearly one-third of the total population of the province. In Changde Prefecture, Hunan Province, 2.5 million laborers participated in fertilizer accumulation last winter, of which 1.1 million were women. The situation in other provinces and regions is roughly the same, which is a gratifying phenomenon.

However, with the rising enthusiasm of rural women for labor, accidents involving injuries and deaths of women and children have increased. Things like women having miscarriages due to overwork, and children being injured or dying due to lack of care, are often heard of in various regions. Before the cooperative movement, such things were inevitable during the busy farming season; but now there are special reasons for it.

The special reason, in the final analysis, is that in the high tide of agricultural cooperativization and agricultural production, the special circumstances of women have not been deeply recognized by the general public, and the special interests of women have not been truly valued and cared for by the general public.

Participating in agricultural production is a right and duty that rural women should have, and raising children and engaging in housework are also unshirkable responsibilities of rural women. This is the special circumstance of women that differs from men. When considering and using women's labor, we must start from this special circumstance, fully take care of their special needs and practical difficulties, mobilize them to participate in appropriate agricultural production, and manage their own housework well.

However, some rural workers have not done this. When mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production, they one-sidedly promote the slogan of "labor is glorious," saying "participating in productive labor is glorious, and it is shameful to work at home and rely on men for food." "If women want to be liberated, they must produce like men!" As a result of this one-sided propaganda, many women regard housework as an extra burden, and housework has become the root of quarrels between husband and wife and disharmony in the family. In Yuanzheng Cooperative of Qianping Township, Jianshi County, Hubei Province, Zhang Mingyue's wife is responsible for heavy housework such as cooking, making shoes, washing and mending clothes, chopping firewood, carrying water, grinding grain, raising pigs, and growing vegetable gardens. She has fewer opportunities to directly participate in agricultural production, and of course she earns fewer work points. Her husband said that she was hiding in the house and not working, eating food that exploited men; she also complained that her husband did not take care of housework, which prevented her from participating in agricultural production. In our country, labor is a glorious thing. It is of course necessary to use the slogan of "labor is glorious" to mobilize some women who are not yet conscious to participate in productive labor. However, if this slogan is interpreted one-sidedly, if it is opposed to women's housework, it will become a kind of mental pressure on women. Accidents involving injuries and deaths of women and children often occur under this mental pressure.

We should have a comprehensive view of labor. Agricultural production is naturally the main labor in rural areas. However, is it not a very meaningful labor for society for women to manage housework well, raise children well, and enable men to engage in productive labor with peace of mind and joy? Of course, this does not mean that women can only engage in housework and do not need to participate in agricultural production. Women's participation in productive labor is not only a need for national construction, but also a need for women themselves. Only by participating in productive labor can women's economic status be truly improved and they can achieve complete liberation. Rural workers should help women arrange housework well, solve various practical difficulties, so that they can participate in production happily, and no longer worry about accidents involving injuries and deaths of children.

In the cooperativized countryside, the principle of "to each according to his work, more work more pay" is already well known. In order to work more and get more remuneration, many women desperately work regardless of everything. In this case, rural workers and leaders of cooperatives should conduct safety education for women, and reasonably use women's labor according to their physiological characteristics and the busy and idle situation of housework. Only in this way can we avoid accidents and maintain women's enthusiasm for labor. However, some people turn a blind eye to women's physiological characteristics and the actual situation that women need to take care of housework, and are indifferent. When arranging farm work, they ask women to undertake things that women cannot do. A cooperative in Liling District, Wujiang County, Jiangsu Province, even wrongly stipulated that pregnant women should be paid double for working during their pregnancy, which actually contributed to the occurrence of casualties.

Some people treat women's labor with an extremely wrong idea, they say: Since women demand equal pay for equal work and equality between men and women, they should do the same work as men, and men should carry two hundred catties, and women should also carry two hundred catties. When Sangchuan Township Fourth Cooperative in Qin'an County, Gansu Province, was building water conservancy, the staff insisted on asking women to go down to work in a cellar eighteen feet deep. Some women did not dare to go down, and the head of the cooperative satirized her and said: "If you talk about equality between men and women, you have to dig the cellar in the same way." In order to save face, the women had to try their best to compete with men. These people who discriminate against women should understand: the phenomenon of discrimination against female commune members is not allowed by the articles of association of agricultural cooperatives. The existing agricultural cooperatives are generally large in scale and have a wide range of operations. Among agriculture and sideline industries, there are many jobs that women are more suitable for than men. The leaders of the cooperative should arrange women's work appropriately according to their physiological characteristics and specialties, so as to increase the production of the cooperative and meet the requirements of women to increase their income.

In order to meet the needs of the development of cooperative production and meet the requirements of women to actively participate in production, the cooperative should make plans for women's labor. Some cooperatives think that the more women work, the better, and try to squeeze out the time for women to take care of housework when making plans. However, necessary housework must be taken care of, which results in increasing the burden of women's labor. The Guangming Agricultural Cooperative in Tongshan County, Jiangsu Province, determined that the average female full laborer in the whole cooperative should do 270 work days a year, and the semi-laborer should do 200 work days. However, according to the cooperative's survey of twelve female full and semi-laborers, they lost 131 days a year due to taking care of housework, giving birth to children, visiting relatives, etc. when they were in the primary cooperative last year; the female full laborers actually participated in collective labor for only 170 days, and the semi-laborers for only 60 days. Judging from this survey material, the cooperative's requirements for women's labor this year are obviously too high and too hasty. If this plan is forced to be realized, it will inevitably lead to the consequence of women's overwork. Under the current social conditions in our country, it is still difficult to reduce the housework of rural women for a while. If we do not treat the labor problem of women in a realistic way, it will cause great losses. There is a saying in rural Hunan: "Women are half the sky." In the high tide of building socialism, can we ignore the issue of protecting the health and safety of women and children?

### 保护农村妇女儿童的健康

    保护农村妇女儿童的健康
    农业合作化高潮在农村中引起的重大变化之一，就是广大农村妇女越来越多地参加了农业主要劳动。在去年冬季和今年春季，山东省从事各种农副业生产的妇女，几占全省人口总数的三分之一。湖南省常德专区去年冬季有二百五十万个劳动力参加积肥工作，其中有一百一十万人是妇女。其他各个省区的情况大致相同，真是一种可喜的现象。
    但是，随着农村妇女劳动积极性的高涨，妇女、儿童伤亡事故却多起来了。像妇女劳累过度因而流产，儿童缺乏照顾因而伤亡的事情，各个地区时有所闻。在合作化运动以前，在农忙时节也难免发生这种事情；但现在却有特别的原因在。
    这个特别的原因，归根到底，就是在农业合作化和农业生产高潮中，妇女的特殊情况还没有为一般人所深刻认识，妇女的特殊利益也没有为一般人所真正重视和关心。
    参加农业生产是农村妇女应有的权利和义务，养育子女、从事家务劳动也是农村妇女不可推卸的职责。这就是妇女不同于男子的特殊情况。在考虑和运用妇女劳动力的时候，必须从这种特殊情况出发，充分照顾她们的特殊需要和实际困难，发动她们参加适当的农业生产，并且管好自己的家务。
    但是有些农村工作人员却没有这样作。他们在动员妇女参加农业生产的时候，片面地宣传“劳动光荣”的口号，说“参加生产劳动是光荣的，在家里干活，靠男人吃饭，是可耻的。”“妇女要想解放，就得和男人一样生产！”这样片面宣传的结果，就使许多妇女把家务事当成额外负担，使家务劳动成为夫妻吵嘴、家庭不和的根源。湖北省建始县乾坪乡远征合作社的社员张明月夫妇，女方担负做饭、做鞋、洗补衣服、砍柴、挑水、推磨、打猪草、种菜园等繁重的家务劳动，直接参加农业生产的机会比较少，得的工分当然也少。丈夫说她躲在屋里不出工，吃剥削男人的饭；她又埋怨丈夫不管家务事，妨碍她参加农业生产。在我们的国家中，劳动是光荣的事情。用“劳动光荣”的口号动员某些还不自觉的妇女参加生产劳动，当然是必要的。可是，如果把这个口号加以片面的解释，如果把它和妇女的家务劳动对立起来，它就会变成对妇女的一种精神压力。妇女儿童的伤亡事故，常常是在这种精神压力下发生的。
    对于劳动，应该有全面的看法。农业生产自然是农村的主要劳动。但是，妇女把家务管好，把孩子带好，使男人能够安心愉快地从事生产劳动，这难道不是对社会很有意义的劳动吗？当然，这决不是说妇女只能从事家务劳动，不需要参加农业生产。妇女参加生产劳动，不仅是国家建设的需要，而且是妇女本身的需要。只有参加了生产劳动，妇女的经济地位才能真正提高，才能够获得彻底的解放。农村工作人员应该帮助妇女很好地安排家务劳动，解决各种实际困难，使她们愉快地参加生产，不再顾虑发生儿童伤亡事故。
    在合作化的农村中，“按劳取酬、多劳多得”的原则已经家喻户晓。为了多劳动多得报酬，许多妇女不顾一切地拚命干活。在这种情况下，农村工作人员和合作社的领导人员，应该很好地对妇女进行安全教育，按照妇女的生理特点和家务忙闲情况，合理地运用妇女劳力。只有这样，才能避免意外事故，经常保持妇女的劳动积极性。可是，有些人对妇女的生理特点和妇女需要操持家务的实际情况熟视无睹，漠不关心，在安排农活的时候，把妇女不能胜任的事情也叫妇女担任。江苏省吴江县黎里区有一个合作社，甚至错误地规定产妇在产期当中干活加倍计工的办法，实际上助长了伤亡事故的发生。
    有些人用一种极端错误的思想对待妇女劳动，他们说：妇女既然要求同工同酬，男女平等，就应该和男人做一样的活，男人挑二百斤，女人也应该挑二百斤。甘肃省秦安县桑川乡第四社在兴修水利的时候，工作人员硬要叫妇女下到一丈八尺深的窖里去工作。有的妇女不敢下去，社长就讽刺她说：“讲男女平等，就要一样打窖。”妇女为了争口气，只好拚命和男人比着干。这些歧视妇女的人应该了解：歧视女社员的现象，是农业合作社的章程所不能允许的。现有的农业合作社一般的规模较大，经营的方面很广，农业、副业当中，有许多工作妇女做起来比男人还要合适。合作社的领导人员应该根据妇女的生理特点和特长，适当地安排妇女的工作，做到既能够增加合作社的生产，又能够满足妇女增加收入的要求。
    为了适应合作社生产发展的需要，满足妇女积极参加生产的要求，合作社应当对妇女的劳动作出规划。有的合作社在进行规划的时候，以为妇女出工越多越好，尽量挤掉妇女料理家务的时间。但必要的家务事情又必须料理，结果就加重了妇女劳力的负担。江苏省铜山县曙光农业合作社确定全社女整劳力平均每人一年要做二百七十个工作日，半劳力要做二百个工作日。但是，根据这个社对十二个女整、半劳力的调查，她们去年在初级社的时候，因为料理家务、生育孩子、走亲戚等等，一年要误工一百三十一天；实际参加集体劳动的女整劳力只有一百七十天，半劳力只有六十天。从这个调查材料看来，这个社今年对妇女劳动力出工的要求，显然是过高过急的。如果硬要实现这个规划，势必造成妇女过度劳累的后果。在我国目前的社会条件下，农村妇女的家务劳动一时还难于减轻。如果不实事求是地对待妇女的劳动问题，就会造成极大的损失。湖南农村有句俗话说：“妇女是半边天”。在建设社会主义的高潮当中，难道可以忽视保护妇女儿童的健康和安全的问题么？
