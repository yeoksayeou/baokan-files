    Proceeding from the Specific Circumstances of the Time and Place
    By our reporter Yu Ming
    In the face of agricultural cooperativization and the upsurge in production, most party organizations and cadres in Anhui Province leading rural work have changed their work methods and styles. They are not only bold in supporting new things and promoting advanced experiences, but also realistic and implement the decisions of higher authorities in accordance with local conditions. However, some party organizations and cadres, after criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking, have developed a phenomenon of not proceeding from reality. Some ignore the actual problems that still exist in their regions; others do not consider the actual conditions when deploying work, resulting in unrealistic demands being placed on agricultural production cooperatives. This work style has already caused losses in some places.
    This spring, many cooperatives in Lingbi and Sixian counties in Huaibei were affected by severe spring famine, which affected spring plowing and production. Why did this happen? It turned out that Lingbi and Sixian counties suffered severe flooding last autumn, and in some areas, no crops were harvested in the autumn. However, last winter and this spring, the local party committees, from the township, district, and county levels, all the way up to the prefectural committee, did not take effective measures to address the disaster.
    Why were no effective measures taken? Why was the true extent of the disaster not reported to the higher leading organs in a timely manner? From the district and township cadres of Lingbi County to the leading cadres of the Bengbu Prefectural Committee (formerly the Suxian Prefectural Committee), they all said that the instructions issued by the higher authorities did not emphasize disaster relief, and that the whole country and province were engaged in cooperativization. They feared being criticized by the leading organs if they reported these disasters. At the same time, they also believed that the spring famine problem would be easily solved after cooperativization. Therefore, the local party committee devoted all its efforts to leading the cooperativization movement, and the spring famine developed to a serious extent under the cover of this whitewashing thinking.
    The masses in Lingbi, Suxian, and other places also had opinions on the unrealistic arrangements for water conservancy construction tasks. At the district, township, and cooperative cadre meetings held in Lingbi County, almost everyone in each district had opinions on the water conservancy construction tasks arranged by the higher authorities in the past. People from Shen Village in Yinji District said that their village was surrounded by rivers on three sides and mountains on one side, and most of the land was low-lying. Digging ponds and ditches to fully utilize spring water and river water could solve the local drought and flood problems, and only a small portion of the land on higher ground needed well irrigation. However, the higher leading organs did not study these situations well and demanded that more than a hundred wells be dug in this place. By the time of spring plowing and production, many places in Lingbi and Suxian had dug hundreds of earthen wells (i.e., very shallow earthen holes), but not many wells were actually built with bricks. When forced to carry out the tasks, many people dug wells next to river embankments and in low-lying areas where wells were not needed (because the soil was loose and easy to dig), or they dug wells in places where cadres could easily see them. They said that digging wells was only for completing tasks for the higher authorities. "Even if it doesn't rain for a year, these wells may not be useful."
    The following situations also illustrate that the leadership style in some places is not realistic enough. Some leading organs, regardless of the specific conditions, require the lower levels to carry out the "Thousand Catty Township" and "Thousand Catty Cooperative" movements. A small number of cooperatives, in order to respond to the call of the higher authorities, blindly set very high production increase plans. After the plans were made, these leading organs did not actively lead them to create the conditions for increasing production. This subjective and unrealistic plan is only harmful to production increase and not beneficial. It not only fails to encourage the enthusiasm of the masses for production, but on the contrary, because everyone knows that the plan cannot be completed, they do not actively strive for its realization.
    Although the above problems have now been discovered by the local party committee and the higher party committee, and some have been corrected, and some are being corrected, these facts are of great educational significance to us.
    Some people say: "This year, because the higher authorities did not issue instructions emphasizing disaster relief, we did not pay attention to the disaster situation in our region." "Sometimes, although the arrangements made by the higher authorities do not conform to the local situation, we dare not report them to the higher authorities." These reflections show that many comrades still separate or even oppose being responsible to the higher authorities and being responsible to the masses. Without instructions from the higher authorities, they dare not report the urgent problems in the lives of the local people to the higher authorities; even though the tasks arranged by the higher authorities are clearly not completely in line with the local actual situation, they do not report the situation and put forward opinions so as to complete the tasks arranged by the higher authorities in accordance with local conditions. On the surface, these comrades are very serious and responsible for the instructions of the higher authorities, but in fact, it is a kind of not serious and not responsible practice.
    All the resolutions and instructions made by the Party and the government, and all the tasks arranged, are for the interests of the masses and are responsible to the masses, and they are also in line with the general situation below. However, our region is so large, and each region has its own characteristics and different situations. The leading organs can only make resolutions and instructions and arrange work tasks based on the basic situation of most regions, and it is impossible to take into account the special circumstances of each region. If the spirit of the higher-level instructions differs from the situation in the region, then the higher-level instructions should not be mechanically instilled, but the situation should be reported to the higher-level authorities truthfully, and practices suitable to the situation in the region should be put forward, and the higher-level authorities should be requested to approve and then implement them. Only in this way can we treat the instructions of the higher authorities with a truly serious attitude.
    Take the spring famine in Lingbi and Sixian counties as an example. It is a fact that the whole country is celebrating a bumper harvest, and a high tide of agricultural cooperativization has appeared in the rural areas of the whole country. However, this fact must not change the serious spring famine in Lingbi and Sixian. At the same time, since the vast majority of regions are having bumper harvests, of course the leading organs will not focus on disaster relief when arranging work. However, this does not mean that Lingbi and Sixian have to be like most other regions, only engaged in the cooperativization movement and other central work, and not pay attention to production and disaster relief work. What is the purpose of the cooperativization movement? It is nothing more than to improve agricultural production and thus improve the lives of farmers. However, if the lives of farmers are currently threatened by a serious disaster, but the leading organs do not care about it, then even if you make the cooperativization movement vigorous and set the production increase plan very well, it will still fail in the end, and the leading organs will also become detached from the masses because of this. In this way, these leading organs have not fulfilled their responsibilities to the higher authorities or to the lower levels. On the contrary, if the Lingbi and Sixian county party committees and the local prefectural committee can truly proceed from reality and from the current urgent needs of the masses, truthfully report the situation and put forward opinions to the higher authorities, and make leading the masses to produce and help themselves the central task at present, and slow down the speed of cooperativization compared with other regions, and combine production and disaster relief work with the cooperativization movement, then they can not only lead the masses to overcome the spring famine, but also lay a better foundation for the healthy development of the cooperativization movement and for this year's production increase. In this way, they are both responsible to the lower levels and responsible to the higher authorities. Unfortunately, the local leading organs lack this true spirit of responsibility.
    It is worth noting that this phenomenon is not isolated in the current rural leadership work. The style of commandism, turning good things into bad things, often happens in this situation. This issue is particularly worthy of attention now. Because after cooperativization, the tasks of rural construction are getting bigger and bigger, and the number of departments issuing instructions is increasing day by day. If the local party committee does not truly do the work of "understanding the situation and mastering policies," but only plays the role of conveying the instructions of the higher authorities, then the impact will not be just a few dozen households as in previous years, but thousands of households. This situation shows that the responsibility of leadership has increased, not decreased; it also shows how important it is to further improve the style of leadership!

    从当时当地的具体情况出发
    本报记者　于明
    在农业合作化和生产高潮的面前，安徽省大多数领导农村工作的党组织和干部，工作方法和作风都有所改变，既能大胆放手地支持新事物和推广先进经验，又能实事求是，因地制宜地执行上级的决定。但是也有一些党组织和干部，在批判右倾保守思想以后，却又产生了一种不从实际出发的现象。有的忽视本地区实际仍然存在的问题；有的在布置工作时不考虑当地的实际情况，以致对农业生产合作社提出一些不切实际的要求来。这种工作作风已经使一些地方的工作受到了损失。
    今年春天，淮北灵璧、泗县有不少合作社因为春荒严重，而使春耕生产受到影响。为什么会发生这种现象呢？原来灵璧、泗县去年秋季遭受了严重的涝灾，部分地区秋季颗粒未收。可是，去冬今春，当地党委，从乡、区、县，一直到地委，却都没有对灾荒问题采取有效措施。
    为什么没有采取有效措施呢？为什么又没有把灾情的真实情况及时反映给上级领导机关呢？从灵璧县的区、乡干部一直到蚌埠地委（原宿县地委）的领导干部，都这样谈：上级布置工作的指示中没有强调救灾问题，全国、全省又都在搞合作化，把这些灾情反映上去，怕受到领导机关的批评。同时，他们还以为合作化以后，春荒问题会很容易解决。于是当地党委就全力领导合作化运动，春荒就是在这样一种粉饰太平的思想掩蔽下，发展到了严重的程度。
    灵璧、宿县等地群众对水利兴修任务的布置不切合实际也有意见。灵璧县召开的区、乡、社干部会议上，几乎每个区的人，都对上级过去布置的水利兴修任务有意见。尹集区申村的人说，他们那里本是三面临河，一面靠山，大部土地是洼地，挖塘、挖沟，充分利用泉水和河水，就可以解决当地旱涝问题，只是在高地上的一小部分土地才需要打井灌溉。但是上级领导机关却没有很好研究这些情况，就要这个地方打一百多眼井。灵璧、宿县到春耕生产的时候，许多地方都挖了几百个土井（即很浅的土洞子），而真正砌成的井并不多。不少群众在被迫执行任务的时候，就把井打到河堰旁边和不需要井的洼地里（因为那里土虚容易挖），或者把井打到干部容易看到的地方。他们说，反正打井是专为向上级交任务的，“一年不下雨，这些井也不一定能用得到。”
    以下一些情况，也说明了某些地方的领导作风是不够实事求是的。有的领导机关不问具体条件如何，就要求下边开展千斤乡、千斤社运动。少数合作社为了响应上级号召，盲目地把增产计划订得很高。计划订出来之后，这些领导机关又不积极领导他们创造增产的条件。这种主观主义脱离实际的计划，对于增产只有坏处没有好处。它不但不能鼓舞群众的生产热情，相反地，因为大家知道计划是无法完成的，也就不积极地为它的实现而奋斗。
    虽然，以上的问题，现在已经被当地党委和上级党委发现，有的已经纠正，有的正在纠正。但是，这些事实对我们是有很大教育意义的。
    有人说：“今年，因为上级没有发过强调救灾的指示，所以我们也不重视自己地区的灾情。”“有时上级布置虽然不切合本地情况，但是也不敢向上反映。”从这些反映可以看出，有不少同志仍然把对上级负责和对群众负责截然分开甚至对立起来。没有上级指示，他们就不敢把当地群众生活中迫切需要解决的问题向上级反映；上级布置的任务，虽然明明不完全符合当地实际情况，也不向上反映情况和提出意见，以便因地制宜地完成上级布置的任务。从表面上看起来，这些同志对上级的指示是很认真很负责的，实际上，却是一种不够认真不够负责的作法。
    党和政府所做的一切决议、指示，所布置的一切任务，都是为了群众的利益、对群众负责的，也是符合下边一般情况的。但是，我们的地区是这样的大，各个地区都有自己的特点和不同的情况。领导机关做决议指示，布置工作任务，只能是根据大多数地区的基本情况，而不可能照顾到每个地区的特殊情况。如果上级指示的精神和本地区的情况有出入，就不应该机械地硬把上级的指示往下灌，而应该如实地向上级反映情况，提出适合于本地区情况的作法，请求上级批准而后执行。只有这样，才是以真正严肃认真的态度对待上级的指示。
    就以灵璧、泗县的春荒来讲。全国喜庆丰收，全国农村都出现农业合作化高潮，这是事实。但是，这个事实决不能改变灵璧和泗县的严重的春荒。同时，既是绝大多数地区丰收，当然领导机关布置工作时就不会以救灾为中心。但是，这决不是说灵璧、泗县也就得像其他大多数地区一样，只搞合作化运动和其他中心工作，而不注意生产救灾工作。合作化运动的目的是什么？无非是提高农业生产从而改善农民生活。但是，如果眼前农民的生活正受着严重的灾荒的威胁，领导机关却不去过问，这样，即使你把合作化运动再搞得轰轰烈烈，增产计划定得再好，最后还是要落空的，领导机关也要因此而脱离群众。这样，这些领导机关不管是对上或是对下，就都没有很好地负起责任来。相反地，如果灵璧、泗县县委和当地地委能够真正从实际出发、从群众当前的迫切要求出发，如实地向上级反映情况、提出意见，把领导群众生产自救做为当前的中心工作，把合作化的速度比其他地区稍为放慢一点，把生产救灾工作和合作化运动结合起来，这样，就不仅可以领导群众战胜春荒，而且可以为合作化运动的健康发展、为今年的增产打下更好的基础。这样，就是既对下负责，也对上负责。可惜，当地领导机关正是缺少这种真正的负责精神。
    值得注意的是，这种现象，在目前农村领导工作中并不是个别的。强迫命令作风，把好事办成坏事，常常就是在这种情况下发生的。现在这一问题特别值得重视。因为合作化以后，农村的建设任务越来越大，下指示的部门也一天比一天多起来，地方党委如果不是真正作“了解情况与掌握政策”的工作，而仅仅是起到转达上级指示的作用，那么受影响的就不像往年那样只是几户几十户，而是千户万户。这一情况说明，领导的责任是加重了，不是减轻了；也说明进一步改进领导作风是多么重要的事情！
