The Mail Order Service Department of Shanghai Wing On Company
	Song Deqi, Xu Yisheng
	The mail order service department of Shanghai Wing On Company receives a large number of letters every day, some from remote areas of the motherland, such as Xinjiang, Yunnan, and Hainan Island, and some from rural areas and mountains. These letters put forward various different requests, some for whole batches of electric sewing machines and glass instruments, and some for a few fishhooks and a few erhu strings. After receiving these letters, the mail order department packs the goods into parcels according to the customers' opinions and sends them to the consumers.
	The mail order service department has been established for more than 30 years, and it is one of the operating characteristics of Wing On Company. After the joint public-private ownership, it has received greater trust from consumers. From January to the end of April this year, the transaction amount was more than eight times the total transaction amount in the three months before the joint venture. Customers often trust the mail order department as if they were entrusting a close friend, and make various requests to the mail order department. The staff of the Wing On Company's mail order department always complete these requests with pleasure.
	On March 12th this year, the mail order service department received a letter from a comrade in the planning section of the Zhengzhou No. 3 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory. The letter said: "...We are from Jiangnan, and we have been living in Shanghai in the past. There are two of us, husband and wife, and a little boy (four years old, very white and chubby). The second child is about to be born. We like to eat snacks very much, and we also like to appreciate some exquisite daily necessities. We have remitted 10 yuan, please buy a hat for the child to wear in spring and autumn. Please base the color and style on the principle of beauty and generosity. Please use the remaining money to purchase some edible items..."
	It was the first time in more than 30 years that the Wing On Company's mail order department had received a letter that did not specify the name, specifications, or quantity of the goods. All the staff of the mail order department specially held a meeting on this matter. Some said: According to the letter, the four-year-old child is white and chubby, and the customer lives in the city, so the selected hat should be suitable for urban life and be economical and practical. When discussing the child's toys, a dispute arose within the group. Some said that a car that can make sounds and walk would be very good, but others said that a four-year-old child might not be able to control it himself. At that time, it was decided to borrow a car for an employee with a four-year-old child, let him take it home to experiment, and also give the child three other toys for the child to choose from. Finally, someone at the meeting proposed: According to the customer's letter that the second child is about to be born, some food suitable for pregnant women must also be provided. After the meeting, the staff of the mail order department selected a pink and light yellow jockey cap for the four-year-old child. According to the results of the child's experiment, the child was most interested in the car and could control it himself, so they decided to choose the car. In order to take care of the pregnant woman's taste, they also selected Wing On Company's own famous walnut candy and slightly sour preserved plums, dried bayberries, and big fortune fruits. In addition, considering that customers are interested in exquisite daily necessities, they also added three exquisite handkerchiefs, two square scarves and a children's towel. This package from Shanghai to Zhengzhou contained a total of sixteen items.
	On April 5th, the staff of the mail order service department found another letter from the comrade in the planning section of the Zhengzhou No. 3 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory in many letters: "We picked up the wooden box from the post office on the 30th. Our family took out the items carefully distributed by you with excitement, including food, supplies, and toys; taking care of the children and the adults. There are many varieties, but the cost is not high. We are very satisfied..." From January to March, a total of seventeen such letters of thanks or praise were received. All the staff of the mail order service department felt extremely honored and happy. They believed that they must better serve consumers. Now the staff of the mail order department has proposed the three-fast slogan of fast reply, fast packaging, and fast delivery, to maintain close contact with consumers and do a good job in commodity supply.

    上海永安公司的邮售服务部
    宋德其　徐义生
    上海永安公司的邮售服务部，每天收到大批的来信，有的来自祖国的边远地区，如新疆、云南、海南岛，有的是来自农村、山野。这些来信，提出了各种不同要求，有的要整批的电动缝纫机、玻璃仪器，也有的是要几只鱼钩、几根胡琴弦线，邮售部在接到这些信以后，按照顾客的意见，将商品打成包裹寄到消费者手中去。
    邮售服务部成立已经有三十多年历史，它是永安公司经营特点之一。公私合营后，受到了消费者更大的信赖，从今年一月份到四月底为止，交易金额相当于合营前三个月交易总额的八倍多。顾客们常常就像信托一个亲近朋友似的信任邮售部，向邮售部提出各种要求，对于这些要求，永安公司邮售部的工作人员们总是怀着愉快的心情来完成它。
    今年三月十二日，邮售服务部收到了国营郑州第三棉纺织厂计划科一位同志的来信，信上说：“……我们是江南人，过去一直居住在上海，家中有我们夫妻二人，还有一个小男孩（四岁，很白尚肥胖），第二个孩子快要出生，我们很喜爱吃零食，也很喜欢欣赏一些精致的日常小用品。邮汇上人民币十元，请你们代买小孩春秋季节戴的帽子一顶，色泽及式样请根据美观大方的原则，余款请配售一些食用的物品……”
    不指定商品名称、规格、数量的信件，三十多年来，永安公司邮售部还是第一次收到。全体邮售部工作人员特地为这件事召开了一个会议，有的说：根据来信所说，四岁的孩子长得又白又胖，顾客又是住在城市，选择的帽子应该适合城市生活特点，并要经济实惠。讨论到孩子的玩具，组内发生了争论，有的说配一辆会叫会走的汽车，一定很好，但有的人说，四岁的孩子是否自己会操纵。当时就决定先借一辆汽车给一位有四岁孩子的职工，让他带回家去试验，同时还另外给这个孩子三种玩具，让孩子选择。最后在会上还有人提出：根据顾客来信中第二个孩子快要出生的情况，还必须配些孕妇适宜的食品。会后，邮售部的工作人员给四岁的孩子挑选了一顶粉红夹浅黄色的赛马童帽，玩具根据孩子试验的结果，对汽车最有兴趣而且自己能够操纵，便决定选了汽车，为了照顾孕妇的口胃还选择了永安公司自制的著名的胡桃糖和略带酸味的加应子、话梅、杨梅干、大福果等，此外，又考虑到顾客对精致的日常小用品有兴趣，又配上三条精美的手帕，二条方巾一条童用毛巾。这个从上海寄到郑州去的包裹，里面一共是十六种商品。
    四月五日，邮售服务部的工作人员又在许多来信中发现了郑州国棉三厂计划科那位同志的来信：“我们在三十日从邮局里取回了木箱，一家人以兴奋的心情逐件拿出经你们精心配售的物品，有吃的，用的，也有玩的；照顾了小孩，也照顾了大人。品种既多，花费却不算多，我们感到很满意……”像这样的感谢或表扬的来信，一至三月共计收到十七件。邮售服务部全体职工都感到无比光荣和愉快，他们认为必须更好地为消费者服务。现在邮售部的工作人员提出：复信快，包装快，寄运快的三快口号，同消费者保持密切联系，做好商品供应工作。（附图片）
