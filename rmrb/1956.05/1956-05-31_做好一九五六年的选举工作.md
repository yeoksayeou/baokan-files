In accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the term of office of people's congresses of municipalities directly under the Central Government, counties, cities, districts under municipalities, townships, ethnic townships, and towns is two years. On March 10, 1955, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress decided that the election of the second term of deputies to the people's congresses with a term of two years should be handled uniformly in 1956. Now, the State Council, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and the decision of the Standing Committee, has issued "Instructions on the 1956 Election Work." This is an important event in the political life of our people. All localities must conscientiously implement the instructions of the State Council and strive to do a good job in this year's election work.

At present, our country is in the midst of a great upsurge of socialist revolution. Conducting elections under such a new situation will greatly advance our socialist construction and socialist transformation. Through elections, the people will elect their beloved activists who have emerged in the socialist construction and socialist transformation movements, as well as representative figures who support the socialist road, to the state power organs, replenish the state power organs with new forces, strengthen ties with the broad masses of the people, and improve work efficiency. Through this election, the broad masses of the people will once again receive profound socialist democratic education, their labor enthusiasm will be further enhanced, and they will more actively engage in the cause of socialist construction.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, our people have experienced a universal suffrage movement, which was the election of deputies to people's congresses at all levels in 1953 and 1954. During this universal suffrage movement, basic-level elections were conducted in areas inhabited by more than 571.4 million people across the country; the number of voters who participated in the voting accounted for 85.88% of the total number of registered voters. Through this universal suffrage, the political enthusiasm and political consciousness of the people have been greatly improved, and their trust and support for the Communist Party and the People's Government have been further strengthened. In this universal suffrage, leading bodies at all levels and the people across the country also gained some work experience. This has laid a good working foundation for this year's election.

The tremendous changes that have taken place in rural and urban areas have brought very favorable conditions for this year's election work. First of all, with the progress of the socialist revolution, workers, peasants, intellectuals, and people from all walks of life across the country have demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm and political initiative on all fronts. This valuable labor enthusiasm and political initiative, reflected in the election, will inevitably be an enthusiastic, active, and conscious participation in electoral activities. Secondly, the vast majority of people across the country have already participated in socialist or semi-socialist economic organizations. During the first national universal suffrage, most of the people were still in a state of scattered disorganization in terms of economic life. Therefore, a series of activities such as propaganda and education for election work, voter registration, voter group meetings, and election meetings encountered difficulties of varying degrees. Now that the people have been organized economically, these difficulties will inevitably be greatly reduced.

Of course, this does not mean that this year's election work will not encounter any difficulties. 1956 is a year of unprecedented upsurge in our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation. After opposing right-leaning conservative thinking, all work has been carried out on a broad scale, and the election work must be completed on schedule in 1956. Therefore, the large number of tasks and the tight schedule are the difficulties. In order to overcome this difficulty and strive to concentrate efforts to do a good job in election work in a relatively short period of time, it is necessary to properly arrange the time for election work and other central tasks. The State Council, in accordance with the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, stipulates in the instructions that the basic-level election work should generally be carried out between July and November, which is completely appropriate. This period is precisely the gap in agricultural production. Local leading organs at all levels should seize the time, concentrate their efforts, and complete the task on schedule within the time stipulated by the State Council to ensure that agricultural production is not affected.

Election work has become a regularly held democratic system. Especially after the first national universal suffrage movement, leading bodies and the people have gained some experience. In addition to the characteristics of this year's large number of tasks and tight schedule, the procedures and methods of this election work should strive to be simple, easy to implement, and practical. Therefore, the voter registration and voter qualification review in this year's election work can be carried out on the basis of the first national universal suffrage by adopting the method of universal registration and key review; the nomination of candidates for deputies and the election method should also be as convenient as possible for the masses; the division of electoral districts and voter groups should be carried out according to the specific conditions of different regions, based on production units in rural areas and based on the residential areas of voters combined with production units or work units in cities. In this way, election affairs can be greatly simplified, and good results can be achieved.

However, simplicity and ease of implementation are not the same as being careless. Election work is an extremely serious political task, and any idea or practice that attempts to be careless is wrong. In order to prevent the possibility of carelessness, all localities should strictly grasp the three specific requirements for basic-level election work stipulated in the instructions of the State Council, which are to do a good job in voter qualification review, mobilize voters to consciously and enthusiastically participate in the election, and do a good job in electing deputies. What cannot be ignored is that the voter qualification review work must ensure that no one who should not have the right to vote steals the solemn right to vote, and at the same time, no one who should have the right to vote is wrongly deprived of the solemn right to vote.

On the basis of doing a good job in the election of deputies to the people's congresses, the first session of the second people's congress should be held successfully. In addition to discussing work and inspecting work at the meeting, members of the people's committee at the same level should also be elected, and basic-level people's congresses should also elect deputies to attend the people's congress at the next higher level. It should be pointed out that holding people's congresses and people's committee meetings on time and successfully is not only necessary for the implementation of the Constitution and laws, but also one of the most important methods to ensure the realization of collective leadership. Collective leadership is the highest principle of the organization and activities of our state organs. Facts have proved that wherever people's congresses and people's committee meetings can be convened and held on time in accordance with the provisions of the law, the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses" can be well implemented, wisdom can be gathered, and collective leadership can be well realized; at the same time, the functions of state organs can be well brought into play, and the tasks of economic and cultural construction in each period can be smoothly solved.

This year's election work will begin soon. People's committees at all levels should establish election organizations as soon as possible in accordance with the instructions of the State Council, train cadres through meetings, and at the same time launch publicity activities and do a good job in other preparations, so as to be able to carry out comprehensive election work on time.

Our country has experienced a national universal suffrage movement. After this election, there is no doubt that the ability of the people to manage state affairs will be further improved, the work of state organs will be further improved, and our people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance will be further consolidated. All this will have a tremendous impact on our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation.

### 做好一九五六年的选举工作

    做好一九五六年的选举工作
    根据中华人民共和国宪法规定，直辖市、县、市、市辖区、乡、民族乡、镇的人民代表大会每届任期两年；1955年3月10日全国人民代表大会常务委员会决定每届任期两年的人民代表大会，其第二届代表的选举一律在1956年办理。现在，国务院依照宪法的规定和常务委员会的决定，发出了“关于1956年选举工作的指示”。这是我国人民政治生活中的一件重要事情，各地必须认真执行国务院的指示，努力做好今年的选举工作。
    目前我国正处在伟大的社会主义革命高潮中。在这样新形势之下进行选举，将会推动我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业大大前进一步。通过选举，人民群众将会把他们所爱戴的、在社会主义建设和社会主义改造运动中涌现出来的积极分子，以及拥护走社会主义道路的有代表性的人物选举到国家政权机构中来，给国家政权机构补充新的力量，加强和广大人民群众的联系，提高工作效能。通过这次选举，广大人民群众将会再一次受到深刻的社会主义民主教育，劳动热情会更加提高，更加积极地投入社会主义建设事业。
    中华人民共和国成立以来，我国人民已经经历了一次普选运动，这就是1953年和1954年的各级人民代表大会代表的选举。在这次普选运动中，全国有五亿七千一百四十多万人居住的地区进行了基层选举；参加投票的选民占登记选民总数的85.88％。经过这次普选，人民群众的政治积极性和政治觉悟大大地提高了，对于共产党和人民政府的信任和支持也进一步加强了。在这次普选中，各级领导方面和全国人民也获得了一些工作经验。这就为今年的选举奠定了良好的工作基础。
    农村和城市发生的巨大变化，给今年的选举工作带来了非常有利的条件。首先是，随着社会主义革命事业的进展，全国的工人、农民、知识分子和其他各界人士，在各个战线上，发挥了高度的劳动热情和政治积极性。这种可贵的劳动热情和政治积极性，反映在选举方面，必然会是热烈地、踊跃地、自觉地参加选举活动。其次，全国绝大多数人民已经参加了社会主义的或者半社会主义的经济组织。全国第一次普选的时候，大多数人民在经济生活方面还处于分散的无组织状态，因而选举工作的宣传教育、选民登记、选民小组会议和选举大会等等一系列活动，都曾遇到程度不同的困难。现在当人民群众在经济方面被组织起来以后，这些困难就必然会大大减少了。
    当然，这并不是说，今年的选举工作不会遇到任何困难。1956年是我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业空前高涨的一年，在反对了右倾保守思想之后，一切工作都以广泛的规模开展起来，而选举工作又必须在1956年内如期完成。因此，任务多，时间紧，这就是困难。为了克服这一困难，争取在较短的时间内集中力量作好选举工作，必须妥善地安排选举工作和其他各项中心工作的时间。国务院根据全国人民代表大会常务委员会的决定在指示中规定，基层选举工作一般应该在七月到十一月间进行，这是完全适当的。这一期间正是农业生产的间隙。地方各级领导机关应该抓紧时间，集中力量，在国务院规定的时间内如期完成任务，保证农业生产不受影响。
    选举工作已经成为定期举行的一项民主制度，尤其是经过全国第一次普选运动，领导方面和人民群众都有了一些经验，再加上今年任务多、时间紧等特点，这次的选举工作，在程序和方法方面就应该力求简便易行和切合实际。因此，今年选举工作中的选民登记和选民资格审查可以在全国第一次普选的基础上，采取普遍登记、重点审查的方法进行；代表候选人的提名和选举方法也应该尽量便利群众；选区和选民小组的划分，应该根据不同地区的具体情况进行，在农村以生产单位为基础划分，在城市以选民居住地区为基础结合生产单位或工作单位划分。这样，就可以大大简化选举事务，并且可以收到良好的效果。
    但是，简便易行并不是草率从事。选举工作是一件极为严肃的政治任务，任何企图草率从事的想法和作法都是错误的。为了防止草率从事的可能发生，各地应该严格掌握国务院指示中所规定的关于基层选举工作应该实现的三项具体要求，就是做好选民资格审查工作，发动选民自觉地、热烈地参加选举和做好选举代表的工作。其中尤其不能忽视的是：选民资格审查工作，必须做到不让一个不应该有选举权利的人窃取了庄严的选举权利，同时也不让一个应该有选举权利的人被错误地剥夺了庄严的选举权利。
    在做好人民代表大会代表选举工作的基础上，要开好第二届人民代表大会的第一次会议。会议上除讨论工作和检查工作以外，还要选出本级人民委员会的组成人员，基层人民代表大会还要选出出席上一级人民代表大会的代表。应当指出：按时召开并且开好人民代表大会和人民委员会的会议，不仅是执行宪法和法律所必需的，而且是保证实现集体领导的最重要的方法之一。集体领导是我们国家机关的组织和活动的最高原则。事实证明，凡是能够按照法律规定及时召开，并且开好人民代表大会和人民委员会会议的地方，就能够很好地贯彻“从群众中来，到群众中去”的群众路线，就能够集思广益，很好地实现集体领导；同时也就能很好地发挥国家机关的职能，顺利地解决每一个时期的经济和文化建设方面的任务。
    今年的选举工作很快就要开始了。地方各级人民委员会应该根据国务院的指示及早成立选举机构，通过会议方式训练干部，同时展开宣传活动，和做好其他各项准备，以便能够按时进行全面的选举工作。
    我们国家已经经历了一次全国普选运动，再经过这次选举之后，毫无疑问，人民群众管理国家事务的能力将更加提高，国家机关的工作将更加改善，我们的工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家也将更加巩固，这一切对于我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，将会发生极其巨大的作用。
