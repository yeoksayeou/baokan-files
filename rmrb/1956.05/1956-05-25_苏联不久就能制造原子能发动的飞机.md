Xinhua News Agency, 24th: TASS reports: Slavsky, Director of the Main Administration for the Utilization of Atomic Energy under the Soviet Council of Ministers, said: We have every reason to believe that we will be able to manufacture aircraft equipped with nuclear engines in the near future. We will manufacture atomic reactors and engines for ocean, land, and air transportation.

    Slavsky spoke to a "Izvestia" reporter about the tasks of the Soviet Union's Main Administration for the Utilization of Atomic Energy in solving the use of atomic energy in various sectors of the national economy. He said: During the new Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union will establish five nuclear power plants with a generating capacity of 400,000 to 600,000 kilowatts each in Moscow, Leningrad, the Urals, and the Sverdlovsk region. In 1959-1960, some small experimental nuclear power plants with a generating capacity of 50,000 kilowatts each will also be built. The establishment of small fixed nuclear power stations or mobile nuclear power stations mounted on vehicles can also bring beneficial results.

    In addition to the above-mentioned industrial nuclear power stations, the Soviet Union will also build an experimental nuclear power station with a generating capacity of 200,000 kilowatts. This power station is equipped with four other types of reactors.

    Slavsky also said that a large number of radioactive isotopes will be formed in atomic reactors. Isotopes have a vast future. The demand for isotopes is constantly increasing. Therefore, the Soviet Union will build many large-scale enterprises to produce isotopes using waste materials from atomic boilers or specially irradiated elements.

    All-Union Conference on High-Energy Particle Physics Concludes
    Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: TASS, Moscow: The All-Union Conference on High-Energy Particle Physics, convened by the Department of Physics and Mathematics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, closed on May 22nd.

    A total of more than 120 major and minor reports were delivered at the plenary session and three group sessions of this conference. More than 1,000 Soviet scientists and foreign scholars participating in the conference conducted extensive and detailed discussions on important issues such as high-energy particle physics, the interaction of elementary particles, and the technology of maximum-energy accelerators. This discussion helped to clarify many urgent issues in contemporary nuclear physics.

    During this conference, Soviet and foreign scientists had friendly and practical contacts.
    Soviet Academy of Sciences Holds Conference on Physics of Magnetic Phenomena
    Xinhua News Agency, 24th: TASS, Moscow: The Conference on Physics of Magnetic Phenomena, jointly convened by the Department of Physics and Mathematics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and relevant departments, opened on May 23rd. About 700 Soviet scientists participated in this conference. Scientists from Britain, France, China, the United States, India, and Japan were also invited to participate.

    Corresponding Academician Vonsowski of the Soviet Academy of Sciences said in his opening speech that the discovery of the secrets of material magnetism has opened up broad prospects for the practical application of magnetism in technology. The recently discovered ferromagnetic semiconductor - "ferrite" - is of great significance. These materials have made great progress in high-frequency technology (radio and television).

    At the opening meeting, Dr. Verkin, Deputy Doctor of Physics and Mathematics, made a report entitled "Magnetism of Non-Ferromagnetic Metals at Low Temperatures." Professor Schoenberg of the United Kingdom gave a report on a question related to magnetism at low temperatures. Academician Kikoin reported on the research on photomagnetic effects in semiconductors.

    A total of sixty reports will be heard at this conference.
    American Scientists Say Soviet Physics Has a High Level
    Xinhua News Agency, 24th: TASS reports: A group of American scientists who participated in the All-Union Conference on High-Energy Particle Physics said that they were deeply impressed by the huge scale of Soviet scientists' activities in high-energy physics, the close cooperation between Soviet physicists - experimentalists and engineers, and the high level of Soviet experimental physics and theoretical physics.

    This group of American scientists said this in a statement given to newspapers on May 23rd. They said that the American representatives who participated in the Moscow High-Energy Particle Physics Conference deeply appreciated the hosts of the conference for giving them such a good opportunity to understand the achievements and plans of the Soviet Union in this extremely important department of physical science. We listened to many reports, participated in many lively discussions, and visited many physics laboratories in the Moscow region. We will return to the United States with many good memories of personal contact with Soviet physicists. We believe that our visit to the Soviet Union and the participation of three Soviet physicists in the High-Energy Nuclear Physics Conference in the United States last month will make a great contribution to the cause of restoring international scientific exchange, which we are all convinced of.

    苏联不久就能制造原子能发动的飞机
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联部长会议利用原子能总局局长斯拉夫斯基说：我们有充分的根据在不久的将来就能够制造装有原子能发动机的飞机。我们将制造出海洋、陆地和空中运输的工具所用的原子反应堆和发动机。
    斯拉夫斯基向“消息报”记者谈到了苏联利用原子能总局在解决国民经济各部门使用原子能方面的任务。他说：苏联在新五年计划期间，将在莫斯科、列宁格勒、乌拉尔、斯维德洛夫斯克州建立五个发电能力各为四十万到六十万瓩的原子能发电站。在1959—1960年，还要建造一些发电能力各为五万瓩的小型实验性原子能发电站。建立小型的固定原子能电力站或是装在车辆上的流动原子能电力站的工作，也可以带来有益的结果。
    除去上述的工业用原子能电力站之外，苏联还要建造发电能力为二十万瓩的实验性原子能电力站。这座电力站装置有四个其他类型的反应堆。
    斯拉夫斯基还说，在原子反应堆中会形成大量的放射性同位素。同位素的前途是广大的。对同位素的需求在不断地增长。因此，苏联要建造许多大规模的企业，用原子锅炉的废料或是专门辐射的元素来生产同位素。
    全苏高能量粒子物理学会议闭幕
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：由苏联科学院物理数学部召开的全苏高能量粒子物理学会议，已经在五月二十二日闭幕。
    在这次会议的全体会议和三个小组会议上，一共做了一百二十多个大、小报告。参加会议的一千多位苏联科学家和外国学者，对高能量粒子物理学、基本粒子的相互作用和最大能量的加速器的技术等重要问题，进行了广泛而详细的讨论。这种讨论有助于弄清当代核子物理学的许多迫切问题。
    在这次会议中，苏联和外国的科学家进行了友好和切实的接触。
    苏联科学院召开磁现象物理学会议
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学院物理数学部同有关部门联合召开的磁现象物理学会议，在五月二十三日开幕。参加这次会议的约有七百名苏联科学家。英国、法国、中国、美国、印度和日本等国的科学家也应邀参加会议。
    苏联科学院通讯院士旺索夫斯基在开幕词中说，发现物质磁性的秘密为在技术中实际运用磁性打开了宽广的远景。最近发现的铁磁半导体——“铁淦氧磁物”有重大意义。这些材料使得高频率技术方面（无线电和电视）有了很大进步。
    在开幕会议上，物理数学副博士维尔金作了题为“在低温情况下非铁磁金属的磁性”的报告。英国申贝尔教授就有关低温磁性问题中的一个问题做了报告。基科因院士报告了关于半导体中光磁效果的研究情况。
    这次会议一共将听取六十个报告。
    美科学家说苏联物理学具有高度水平
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社报道：参加全苏高能量粒子物理学会议的一批美国科学家说，苏联科学家在高能量物理学方面活动的巨大规模，苏联物理学家——实验者和工程师的紧密合作，以及苏联实验物理学和理论物理学的高度水平，给他们留下了深刻的印象。
    这批美国科学家是在五月二十三日交给报纸发表的一篇声明中这样说的。他们说，参加莫斯科高能量粒子物理学会议的美国代表，深深地感谢会议的主人使他们有这样一个良好的机会，来了解苏联在这个极其重要的物理科学部门中的成就和计划。我们听了很多报告，参加了许多生动的讨论会，并且参观了莫斯科地区许多物理实验室。我们将带着同苏联物理学家个人接触的许多良好的记忆回到美国去。我们相信，我们这次到苏联访问和上月份三个苏联物理学家到美国参加高能量核子物理会议，将对恢复国际科学交流的事业作出巨大的贡献，这一点我们大家是深信不疑的。
