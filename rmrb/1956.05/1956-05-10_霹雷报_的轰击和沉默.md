　　The Bombardment and Silence of the "Thunderbolt News"
　　Fan Rongkang
    The matter started like this: That morning, as soon as I entered the factory gate, I saw a large crowd of people surrounding a blackboard newspaper. I squeezed in to take a look: Oh, it was the "Thunderbolt News" of our Second Workshop's Youth Supervision Post. The "Thunderbolt News" was always posted in the workshop, how did it get to the factory headquarters today?
    It turned out that the "Thunderbolt News" published an article criticizing some comrades in the Construction Section and Inspection Section for being irresponsible in their work. Speaking of these things, it's really infuriating. This was still something that happened before the New Year: Our workshop just started processing the 1K36 lathe—this is a Soviet model large hexagonal lathe, the efficiency is very high, we are all energetic in doing it. However, there are always unpleasant things happening. The fixture for processing the large headstock was taken down, and upon closer inspection, it was completely mismatched and unusable. Once, the Construction Section designed the broach incorrectly; another time, the tool post was designed too long, also unusable. In short, there were many loopholes in the fixtures and jigs, and I don't know how the Construction Section designed them, and how the Inspection Section inspected them?
    This criticism really worked. A large group of people came down that day: the factory trade union chairman, the production committee member, the factory office secretary, the person in charge of fixture and jig design in the Construction Section, the Party General Branch propaganda committee member, the Communist Youth League General Branch secretary, and some people I didn't recognize. The trade union chairman said: "The problem is very big, we should find a way to solve it," and the Communist Youth League General Branch secretary also said: "The Youth Supervision Post is doing the right thing, we support this criticism." Among them, the factory trade union production committee member had the most active attitude, saying that a meeting should be held immediately to get the section personnel and the workshop director together to study it, and also invite our workshop Party branch secretary to participate and offer opinions.
    Who knew that the next day at work, there was no action. On the third day, the trade union still hadn't looked for the workshop director and Party branch secretary to hold a meeting. On the fourth day, not only was there no news of improving the design work of fixtures and jigs, but words came from the Construction Section, saying "during the transition period, just make do," "this kind of thing is not just once, why make a fuss about it." When we heard this, our lungs were about to explode with anger. On the fifth day, the chief supervisor of the Youth Supervision Post couldn't hold back anymore, and he inquired with the workshop director about the news: "At the scheduling meeting these two days, did the factory director mention the fixture and jig problem?" The workshop director replied with two words: "No mention."
    I really don't know what's going on? So many people came down, how come no one solved the problem?
    After another two days, there was another problem in production. A female comrade from the Construction Section designed the fixture for processing a part again to be completely mismatched and unusable. In those days, we were discussing Chairman Mao's instructions, opposing right-leaning conservative thinking, and everyone was determined to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. But looking at the opinions put forward, not only were they ignored by the higher-ups, but they were still making mistakes, delaying our work, we were really unbearably angry.
    The Youth Supervision Post asked the Party branch for instructions and wanted to issue another "Thunderbolt News." This time it was to criticize the factory headquarters for not supporting the workers' criticisms and not urging the Construction Section and Inspection Section to solve the problem. I thought to myself: If the "Thunderbolt News" goes out tomorrow morning, the supply of fixtures and jigs should improve!
    Who knew it wasn't like that at all. The next day, upon entering the factory, the "Thunderbolt News" was nowhere to be seen. Upon inquiring, I learned that something had happened again. Our workshop Party branch secretary went to the factory trade union, saying that the "Thunderbolt News" was preparing to criticize the factory headquarters for not helping the workers solve the problem. The trade union production committee member—the one who seemed to have the most active attitude when he came down to the workshop last time—got angry upon hearing this: "Why are you criticizing again? Haven't the problems all been solved?"
    The branch secretary was confused: "No!"
    "How could they not be? Wasn't there a meeting?"
    "When was there a meeting? How come I don't know? How come our workshop director didn't participate either?"
    "You were busy! We couldn't find you."
    The branch secretary was also annoyed: "Did the trade union issue a notice?"
    The production committee member had nothing to say, and the two argued. The factory trade union chairman came out and said: "Stop! Stop! I'll call the Construction Section." He immediately made a phone call, and the trade union chairman said to the telephone receiver in a rough voice: "What are you doing? Quickly write a reply to the 'Thunderbolt News.' If it's not written by three o'clock this afternoon, the 'Thunderbolt News' will criticize again!" As if dealing with criticism only requires a reply.
    The Party General Branch propaganda committee member also quickly came to our workshop branch secretary and said: "Consider it before speaking! If the 'Thunderbolt News' keeps bombing, people will say you're bombing them into confusion."
    In this way, the well-written "Thunderbolt News" was not published.
    After another few days, one morning, as soon as I entered the factory, I heard everyone shouting: "'Thunderbolt News' is firing again." I went to the courtyard to take a look, and sure enough, the "Thunderbolt News" was finally posted! Only the places in it that specifically criticized the factory director and the trade union chairman were changed. I looked at it, and the strength was smaller than before, but at least the problem was raised.
    This time, the deputy factory director in charge of production came to the workshop, saying that the large headstock fixture problem, the broach problem, and the tool post length problem would all be resolved within a time limit. I listened and felt it was pretty good, and the three things criticized in the "Thunderbolt News" were all resolved. But, that's not right! The three things pointed out in the "Thunderbolt News" were examples, and the problems in the fixtures and jigs were more than just these three, how could it be okay to not solve the problem thoroughly?
    I looked at others, and for some reason, everyone seemed to have worries. The situation was completely different from the happy and confident appearance after the "Thunderbolt News" first criticized. No one said a word, as if we were the ones being criticized.
    Not long after, our workshop branch secretary had the "Thunderbolt News" quietly taken back.
    From then on, we kept silent, the "Thunderbolt News" didn't fire cannons either, and the chaos of fixtures and jigs increased again. I won't mention the small ones, just talking about one big one! A few days ago, the broach for processing the 1K36 lathe large headstock arrived, this broach had been waited for a long time, and when it arrived that day, the Construction Section also sent someone down, so let's process it! Who knew that as soon as we started, it was immediately scrapped. The workers said: "It won't work! There's a problem with the broach, don't keep going!" The comrades from the Construction Section said: "It doesn't matter, keep going." The second large headstock was put on the machine, and as soon as we started, it was scrapped again. In this way, four large headstocks were scrapped in a row before the broach was taken back for re-"study."
    Broaching is the last process in the processing of a large headstock. Once this process is scrapped, the previous processes must be repeated. The scrapping of four large headstocks added more than one hundred defective work hours to the workshop, caused a loss of more than three thousand yuan to the state, and could also affect the entire factory's plan.
    Such a big loophole in production, not many people outside the workshop knew about it. When our workshop Party branch secretary met the factory director, he told him about it, and the factory director kept shaking his head, saying "it can't be," "it can't be," and didn't even believe it.
    This matter confused me. When the "Thunderbolt News" booms and criticizes the shortcomings of the factory's work, no matter what, the factory director still knows that there is such a thing; but it's not allowed to boom, saying that it's afraid of bombing people into confusion. Okay! We won't boom, the loopholes are even bigger, and this time the factory director doesn't even know about it. If we don't boom, isn't it even more confusing?

### “霹雷报”的轰击和沉默

　　“霹雷报”的轰击和沉默
　　范荣康
    事情是这样开始的：那天早晨，我刚进厂门，就看见一大堆人围着块黑板报。我挤进去一看：哦，是咱们二车间青年监督岗的“霹雷报”。“霹雷报”一向挂在车间里，今天怎么轰到厂部来了？
    原来“霹雷报”上登了一篇文章，批评施工科和检查科有些同志工作不负责任。提起这些事，也真气人。那还是年前的事：咱们车间刚开始加工1K36机床——这是苏联型号的大六角车床，效率可高呢，咱们干得都有劲。可是，总是发生不顺心的事。加工大床头用的治具拿下来了，一看，牛头不对马嘴，用不上。有一次，施工科把绞刀设计错了；又有一次，刀杆给设计长了，也不能用。总之，治具和卡具上漏洞多着呢，也不知施工科是怎么设计的，检查科又是怎么检查的？
    这一批评，确实管事。当天就下来了一大批人：厂工会主席、生产委员、厂部秘书、施工科治卡具设计负责人、党总支宣传委员、团总支书记，还有一些不认识的人。工会主席说：“问题很大，应该想办法解决”，团总支书记也说：“青年监督岗做得对，我们支持这个批评”。里面要数厂工会生产委员态度最积极，他说得马上开个会，把科室人员和车间主任找到一块儿研究研究，还邀请咱车间党支部书记去参加提意见呢。
    谁知第二天上班，并不见有什么动静。第三天，也没见工会找车间主任和党支部书记去开会。第四天，不但没有一点改进治卡具设计工作的消息，反而从施工科传来话啦，说是“过渡时期，将就点”，“这种事也不只一回，何必大惊小怪的”。我们听了，肺都快气炸了。第五天，青年监督岗总监督沉不住气了，他向车间主任探问消息：“这两天调度会上，厂长提治卡具问题没有？”车间主任答了两个字：“没有”。
    真不知是怎么搞的？这么多人下来，怎么就没有一个人给解决问题的呢？
    又过了两天，生产上又出问题啦。施工科一位女同志把加工一个部件的治具又设计得牛头不对马嘴，不能用。那些天，咱们正讨论毛主席的指示，反对右倾保守思想，人人都决心提早完成五年计划。可是一看提出的意见，上面不但不理，还是照样出错，耽误咱们的工作，咱们可真气的别不住啦。
    青年监督岗向党支部请示，又要出“霹雷报”。这回是批评厂部不支持工人的批评，不督促施工科和检查科解决问题。我心里想：明天一早“霹雷报”轰出去，治卡具的供应总该好些吧！
    谁知满不是这么回事。第二天进厂一看，“霹雷报”连个影子都没有。一打听，才知道又出事了。咱们车间党支部书记上了一趟厂工会，说是“霹雷报”准备批评厂部不帮助工人解决问题。工会生产委员——就是上次下车间态度好像最积极的那位同志，一听，火了：“怎么又批评呢？问题不都解决了吗？”
    支部书记奇怪啦：“没有呵！”
    “怎么没有？不是开过会了吗？”
    “几时开过会啦？我怎么不知道？咱们车间主任怎么也没有参加？”
    “你们忙呗！没有找着你们。”
    支部书记也恼了：“工会下过通知了吗？”
    生产委员没有说的啦，两个人顶住了。厂工会主席就出来说：“别！别！我给施工科挂电话。”当时就摇了个电话，工会主席对着电话筒粗声大气地说：“你们是怎么搞的？快给‘霹雷报’写答复。下午三点钟要不写出来，‘霹雷报’又要批评啦！”好像对待批评只要答复一下就行了。
    党总支宣传委员也赶紧来找我们车间支部书记说：“考虑考虑再说吧！‘霹雷报’一个劲儿地轰，人家都叫你们轰糊涂了。”
    就这样，编得好好的“霹雷报”没有轰出来。
    又过了几天，有一个早上，我一进厂就听得大家嚷嚷：“‘霹雷报’又开火了”。我上大院一看，可不是，“霹雷报”终于挂出来啦！只是里面指名指姓批评厂长和工会主席的地方都改了。我看看，劲儿是比原先小，好在问题总算提出来了。
    这回，生产副厂长下车间来啦，说是大床头治具问题，绞刀问题，刀杆长的问题，都要限期解决。我听着，觉得挺好，“霹雷报”上批评的三件事都解决啦。可是，不对呵！“霹雷报”上点的三件事是举的例子，治卡具里的毛病那止这三件，不彻底解决问题能行吗？
    我瞧瞧别人，不知怎么的，好像也都有心事。那情形同“霹雷报”第一次批评之后，大家高高兴兴，满有信心的样子完全不同。谁也不吭气，倒像是咱们受了别人批评似的。
    没过两天，咱们车间的支部书记就让把“霹雷报”悄悄地收回来了。
    从那以后，咱们闷声不响，“霹雷报”也不开炮，治卡具的乱子又多了。小的不提，光说一件大的吧！前几天加工1K36机床大床头的绞刀来了，这绞刀也是等了很久的啦，这天来了，施工科也派人下来啦，就加工吧！谁知刚干上，一下子就给绞废了。工人们说：“不行呵！绞刀有毛病，别往下干啦！”施工科的同志说：“没关系，再干。”第二个大床头又架上了，一干，又废了。就这么一连废了四个大床头，才把绞刀拿回去重新“研究”。
    绞，是大床头加工的最后一道工序。这道工序一废，前面的工序都得重来。四个大床头报废，给车间增加了一百多个废品工时，给国家造成三千多元的损失，而且还能影响全厂的计划。
    生产上出了这么大的漏子，车间外面没有几个人知道。咱们车间的党支部书记遇着厂长，向他说了，厂长左一个“不会吧”，右一个“不会吧”，直摇头，还不相信呢。
    这件事把我弄糊涂了。“霹雷报”轰一轰，批评批评厂里工作的缺点，不管怎样，厂长总还知道有这么件事；可是不让轰，说是怕把人轰糊涂了。好吧！咱们不轰，漏子更大了，厂长这回连知道也不知道了。不轰，不是更糊涂吗？
