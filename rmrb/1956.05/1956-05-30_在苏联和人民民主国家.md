    In the Soviet Union and People's Democracies
    The Soviet Union to Implement Six-Hour Workday for Minor Workers
    Giving them More Time for Studying, Sports, and Rest
    [Moscow, May 29th, this paper's dispatch] The Soviet Union has decided to implement a six-hour workday for employees aged sixteen to eighteen, starting July 1, 1956. Today, all newspapers published the decree issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The newspapers also published the decision of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union regarding wages after the implementation of this system. The decision stipulates that during the shortened workday, minor employees will receive the same wages as adult workers of the same grade for a full workday. For piecework, adult employees will be compensated at the wage rate for the work done during the time that the full workday exceeds the shortened workday of minor employees.
    As we can see, the new workday and wage system, implemented according to the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, will give minor Soviet employees aged sixteen to eighteen two extra hours each day for studying, sports, and rest while maintaining their original wages. Hundreds of thousands of young people in the Soviet Union join various sectors of the national economy each year after graduating from seven-year schools, ten-year schools, technical schools, and factory apprentice schools. The new system is of great significance to them, especially now that Soviet youth are responding to the call of the motherland to participate in construction in the east and north.
    ·Korea·
    Chemical Industry Completes Three-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 29th The chemical industry sector of Korea has already completed the three-year output value plan for 1954-1956 in mid-May, ahead of schedule, and has also completed the production plans for fourteen important products, including ammonium sulfate fertilizer, sulfuric acid, and bleaching powder.
    During the implementation of the three-year plan, major chemical factories in Korea, such as the Hungnam Fertilizer Factory, the Bongung Chemical Factory, the Soonchun Nitrogen Fertilizer Factory, and the Cheongsu Chemical Factory, have all resumed production and are currently producing more than fifty chemical products, including ammonium sulfate fertilizer, nitrogen fertilizer, calcium carbide, caustic soda, sulfuric acid, and emery. The output of chemical fertilizers in the first four and a half months of this year has already reached more than 70% of the total output for the entire year last year. The total output for the whole year will reach 150,000 tons.
    Currently, some Korean chemical products are being sold abroad.
    ·Vietnam·
    Hanoi-Lao Cai Railway to be Repaired Soon
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 29th According to the Vietnam News Agency: The repair work on the Yen Bai-Lao Cai section of the Hanoi-Lao Cai railway is in the final stages of construction. Once this section is completed, the entire Hanoi-Lao Cai railway, which is 295 kilometers long, will be fully repaired.
    Along the winding, newly laid tracks, many houses have been built, bringing life to the formerly almost desolate areas of the mountainous provinces of North Vietnam.
    The road builders are engaged in enthusiastic competition, striving to open the entire line to traffic as soon as possible. At a construction site with workers from South Vietnam, they are singing and smashing stones under the red competition flag. The workers laying gravel are also working happily and intensively. Some road builders are building bridges, while others are building stations.
    In the camps of the track-laying workers, there are tents of all shapes and sizes. These workers have been involved in the reconstruction of the railway since the restoration of peace. The majority of these workers are youth shock troops, who lay 3,300 meters of track per day, compared to only 1,200 meters per day when repairing the Hanoi-Muk Nam Quan railway. Two hundred model workers have emerged among the track-laying workers.
    ·Czechoslovakia·
    Overfulfilled the First Quarter Industrial Plan
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 27th According to a report by the Czechoslovak News Agency on the 26th, Czechoslovakia completed more than 101% of its plan for total industrial output and labor productivity in the first quarter of this year.
    A characteristic of agricultural development in the first quarter was the establishment of more new cooperatives.
    The increase in retail trade can illustrate the further improvement of living standards. Retail sales in the first quarter of this year increased by 8.5% compared to the same period last year.

    在苏联和人民民主国家
    苏联未成年工人将实行六小时工作日制
    使他们有更多的时间学习、运动和休息
    本报莫斯科29日电　苏联决定从1956年7月1日起实行十六岁到十八岁未成年职工的六小时工作日制，今天各报都刊载了苏联最高苏维埃主席团颁布的这项法令。各报并且刊载了苏联部长会议关于实行这个制度后的工资的决定。决定规定：在缩短的工作日中，未成年职工所得的工资与同级的成年工人全工作日的工资相等。对于计件的工作，成年职工全工作日比未成年职工的缩短工作日多出的时间内所做的活，按工资率补发给成年职工这一部分工资。
    我们看到，根据苏共第二十次代表大会的决议而实现新的工作日和工资制度，使苏联十六岁到十八岁的未成年职工在保有原来工资的情形下每天多出两小时来学习、运动和休息。苏联每年有几十万青年从七年制学校、十年制学校、技术学校和工厂艺徒学校参加国民经济各部门的工作，新的制度对他们有重大意义，特别是现在苏联青年响应祖国号召到东部和北部去参加建设的时候。

    在执行三年计划中，兴南肥料工厂、本宫化学工厂、顺川氮肥工厂、青水化学工厂等朝鲜的主要化学工厂都恢复了生产，目前正在生产硫铵肥料、氮肥、电石、苛性钠、硫酸、金钢砂等五十多种化学产品。化学肥料的产量今年头四个半月已经达到去年全年产量的70％以上。今年全年的产量要达到十五万吨。

    河内——老街铁路即将修复
    新华社河内29日电　据越南通讯社讯：河内—老街铁路的安沛—老街段的修复工程正在进行最后的施工。这段铁路修好后，全长二百九十五公里的河内—老街铁路就全部修复了。
    在蜿蜒伸展的新铺的路轨的沿线，许多地方已经建筑起来不少的房屋，这给北越多山省份的以前几乎是荒凉的地区带来了生气。
    修路的人们正在进行热烈的竞赛，争取早日使全线通车。在来自南越的工人的一个工地上，他们在黄边的红色竞赛旗下，一面唱歌一面击碎石头。铺碎石的工人也在愉快而紧张地工作着。筑路工人们有的正在修建桥梁，有的正在修建车站。
    在铺轨工人的营地上，有大大小小的各种形状的帐篷。自从和平恢复以来，这些工人就参加了铁路的重建工作。在这些工人中，大多数是青年突击手，他们每天铺轨三千三百公尺，而在修复河内—睦南关铁路时每天只铺轨一千二百公尺。在铺轨工人中已经涌现出了二百名模范工人。
