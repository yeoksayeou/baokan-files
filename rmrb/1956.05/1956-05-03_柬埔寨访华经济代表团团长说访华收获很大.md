Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, May 1st: The head of the Cambodian Economic Delegation to China, Hu Sen A, upon arriving in Hong Kong on the 1st on his way back home, issued a written statement to the press, saying that the Cambodian Economic Delegation to China had gained a great deal during its stay in China. Representatives of both sides signed the Trade Agreement and Payment Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Cambodia in Beijing on April 24, 1956.
	The statement said that the Cambodian Economic Delegation to China should emphasize that these negotiations were conducted in a very sincere atmosphere.
	The statement said that due to the various conveniences provided by the authorities of the People's Republic of China, we were also able to visit many provinces in China, especially the heavy industry in the Northeast and the light industry and handicrafts in Shanghai and other places.
	The statement concluded that the economic relations between the two countries, which have now been specifically realized, have affirmed the joint statement issued by Prince Sihanouk and Premier Zhou Enlai in February this year. At the same time, the fact of this friendly economic relationship can also serve as evidence that the policy of neutrality and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence can be realized, which have been adopted by the Kingdom of Cambodia. The Kingdom of Cambodia loves peace, and while seeking respect for the opinions of all countries, it will not submit to any unilateral demands.

　　柬埔寨访华经济代表团团长说访华收获很大
    新华社香港1日电　柬埔寨王国访华经济代表团团长胡森阿在返国途中于一日抵达香港时对报界发表一项书面声明说，柬埔寨王国访华经济代表团在中国逗留的期间有很大的收获。双方代表于1956年4月24日在北京签订了中华人民共和国和柬埔寨王国之间的贸易协定和支付协定。
    声明说，柬埔寨王国访华经济代表团应该强调声明，这次谈判是在十分诚恳的气氛中进行的。
    声明说，由于中华人民共和国当局所提供的种种便利，我们还能够访问了中国的许多省份，特别是访问了东北的重工业和上海等地的轻工业与手工业。
    声明最后说，这次具体实现的两国经济关系，已经把西哈努克亲王和周恩来总理在今年二月间所发表的联合声明肯定下来。同时，这种友好的经济关系的事实也可作为证明中立政策与和平共处的五项原则政策是可以实现的证据，这些政策已经被柬埔寨王国采纳了。柬埔寨王国是爱好和平的，它在设法寻求尊重各国的意见的同时，将不对任何单方面屈服。
