    Young Pioneers Agricultural Experimental Field in Elementary School
    The senior grade students of Chengnan Elementary School in Shenyang established a Young Pioneers Agricultural Experimental Field on campus on the 13th. The experimental field has a total of one and a half mu of land, and a total of ninety-seven students are participating in the experimental field. The director, chief technician, stationmaster, technicians, and accountants are all students. The experimental field has a livestock breeding station, an agricultural crop experimental station, and a flower and tree cultivation station.
    On the day of the founding assembly of the Young Pioneers Agricultural Experimental Field, the students wore their red scarves and festive costumes to school, leading the guests to visit the clean, white livestock breeding pens they had built and the lambs and rabbits raised inside. On the land reclaimed by the crop experimental station, the students cultivated and grafted various cucumbers, kidney beans, tomatoes, as well as oil crops such as sunflowers, peanuts, and castor beans. Around the campus, the students also cultivated apricot trees, apple trees, and many beautiful flowers.
    This year, the Young Pioneers Agricultural Experimental Field plans to use the flower transfer pollination method when cultivating sunflowers to increase the weight of the sunflower heads from three and a half liang to six liang. After grafting kidney beans and potatoes, the potatoes will grow in strings like kidney beans. (Our reporter in Shenyang)

    小学校里的少年农业实验场
    沈阳市城南小学高年级的学生，十三日在校园里成立了一个少年农业实验场。实验场共有一亩半地，参加实验场的共有九十七名同学。场长、总技师、站长、技术员、会计等都由同学分别担任。实验场设有家畜饲养站、农业作物试验站、花木培植站。
    在少年农业实验场成立大会的这天，同学们戴上了红领巾，穿上了节日的服装来到了学校，带领着来宾们参观了自己建筑的洁白的家畜饲养圈和圈内饲养着的小羊小兔。在作物试验站开垦的土地上，同学们培植和嫁接着各种黄瓜、芸豆、西红柿以及向日葵、花生、蓖麻等油料作物，在校园的周围，同学们还培植了杏树、苹果树以及许多美丽的花卉。
    少年农业实验场今年计划在培植向日葵时，采用移花授粉法，使向日葵盘由三两半重提高到六两重；芸豆和土豆嫁接后，使土豆长得像芸豆那样一串串的。（本报驻沈阳记者）
