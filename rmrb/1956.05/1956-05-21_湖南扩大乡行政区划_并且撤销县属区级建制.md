Hunan expands township administrative divisions
And abolishes county-level district establishments

    In order to adapt to the needs of agricultural cooperation and agricultural production development, and to further strengthen the leadership role of county-level and grassroots regimes, the Hunan Provincial People's Committee issued a decision on the 18th regarding the expansion of township administrative divisions and the abolition of county-level district establishments.

    According to this decision, the province's existing 15,165 townships will be merged into approximately 3,000 townships. Depending on the different conditions of mountainous, hilly, and plain areas, each township will have a population of approximately 5,000 to 20,000 people. Areas with concentrated ethnic minority populations will be designated as ethnic townships whenever possible. The decision pointed out that with the expansion of township administrative divisions and the implementation of direct county leadership over townships, the district public offices, as dispatched organs of the county people's committees, are no longer necessary and should be abolished during the township merger process. In areas with special circumstances, the leadership strength of working groups can be strengthened, or county offices can be appropriately established.

    The province-wide township merger and district abolition work in Hunan has already begun successively in various counties.

    湖南扩大乡行政区划
    并且撤销县属区级建制
    湖南省人民委员会为了适应农业合作化和农业生产发展的需要，进一步加强县级和基层政权的领导作用，在十八日发布了关于扩大乡的行政区划和撤销县属区级建制的决定。
    根据这个决定，全省现有的15，165个乡，将分别合并为三千个乡左右。按照山区、丘陵区、平原区的不同情况，每乡人口大体为五千人到两万人；凡有少数民族聚居的地区，尽可能划为民族乡。决定指出，随着乡行政区划扩大和县对乡实行直接领导，作为县人民委员会派出机关的区公所，已经没有存在的必要，应该在并乡过程中，将区的编制撤销。在情况特殊地区，可加强工作组的领导力量或适当设县的办事处。
    湖南全省规模的并乡撤区工作，已经开始在各县陆续进行。
