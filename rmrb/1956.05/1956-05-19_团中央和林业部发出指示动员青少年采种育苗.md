The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and the Ministry of Forestry of the People's Republic of China issued instructions on mobilizing young people to carry out seed collection and seedling cultivation.

The instructions stated that one of the main difficulties in the current tree planting and afforestation efforts is the lack of tree seeds and seedlings. In many places, large-scale afforestation cannot be carried out and the original plans cannot be realized due to the lack of tree seeds and seedlings. It can be seen that collecting a large number of tree seeds and cultivating sufficient seedlings is a prerequisite for further carrying out a large-scale mass tree planting and afforestation campaign. The tree planting and afforestation campaigns of the past few years have proven that the broad masses of young people are a strong shock force in the tree planting and afforestation movement. Therefore, vigorously mobilizing and organizing young people to actively collect seeds and cultivate seedlings is one of the important methods to solve the shortage of seeds and seedlings and to carry out tree planting and afforestation campaigns.

The instructions continued that the Youth League organizations and forestry departments should organize young people to collect tree seeds in a timely and active manner. In spring and summer, young people can be organized to collect seeds from trees such as poplar, elm, mulberry, apricot, eucalyptus, and acacia, which have very short maturity periods. Strict attention should be paid to safety during seed collection to avoid accidents. League organizations should conduct safety education for young people and take various safety measures. When children are collecting seeds, they should be supervised and guided by adults.

The instructions stated that in addition to arranging spring and summer seed collection immediately, all localities should also prepare for autumn and winter seed collection work, such as surveying seed sources, finding out the maturity period of various tree seeds, and making autumn and winter seed collection plans.

The instructions also stated that young people in agricultural production cooperatives should use their active actions to run the cooperative's nurseries well. League organizations can mobilize League members with seedling cultivation technology or higher agricultural technology to be responsible for the management of the nurseries. The labor paid by young people in cooperatives for seed collection and seedling cultivation should be reasonably compensated. Young people in factories, mines, enterprises, schools, government offices, etc., can also establish small nurseries if needed to solve their own tree planting needs.

The instructions finally emphasized that the forestry departments and the Youth League organizations should strengthen their leadership over young people's seed collection and seedling cultivation. (Xinhua News Agency)

    团中央和林业部发出指示动员青少年采种育苗
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会和中华人民共和国林业部发出关于发动广大青少年进行采种、育苗工作的指示。
    指示中说，目前植树造林中的主要困难之一，是树种缺乏和树苗不足。许多地方，由于缺乏树种、树苗，而不能进行大规模的造林，实现不了原定的计划。可见，采集大量的树种和培育足够的苗木，是进一步开展大规模的群众植树造林运动的先决条件。过去几年来的植树造林运动，证明广大青、少年是植树造林运动中一支强有力的突击力量。因此，大力发动与组织广大青年、少年积极采种、育苗，是解决种、苗不足，开展植树造林运动的重要方法之一。
    指示接着说，青年团组织和林业部门要适时地、积极地组织青、少年采集树种。在春、夏季可以组织青、少年采集成熟期很短的杨、榆、桑、杏、桉、相思等树的种子。在采种时要严格注意安全，避免发生事故。团的组织要向青少年进行安全教育，并且采取各种安全措施。少年儿童进行采种时，应当有大人照看和指导。
    指示说，除对春夏季采种应即进行布置外，各地对秋冬季采种工作，亦应进行准备，例如调查种源，摸清各种树籽成熟时期，作出秋冬季采种计划等。
    指示又说，农业生产合作社的青、少年，应当以自己的积极行动，把社里的苗圃办好。团的组织，可以动员具有育苗技术或农业技术较高的团员来负责苗圃的经营管理工作。合作社中青年采种育苗所付出的劳动，应合理地给以报酬。工矿、企业、学校、机关等方面的青年，如果有需要的话，也可以建立小型苗圃，以解决自己植树的需要。
    指示最后还特别指出林业部门和青年团的组织，应当加强对青、少年采种、育苗的领导。　（新华社）
