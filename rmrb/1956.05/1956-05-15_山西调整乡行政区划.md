Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 14th. Shanxi Province has completed the adjustment of rural township administrative divisions.

After Luan County was adjusted from the original 140 townships to 40 townships, simply reducing the field ridges and small paths in the fields, and modifying river courses to connect cultivated land, resulted in a significant increase in new arable land. After the merger of Gushan Village in Gutian Township and Shandi Township in Datong City into one township, the cultivated land area was expanded by more than 300 mu, and the water conservancy disputes that had lasted for many years were also resolved.

After the township adjustments, each township relatively increased its number of experienced leading cadres. In the past, due to the large number and disorganization of township units, the county's leadership over the townships was not close or timely, which has been completely resolved after the adjustment.

This adjustment of rural township administrative divisions was based on the local natural conditions and the long-term prospects for agricultural production development. It is extremely beneficial to the systematic utilization of natural conditions and the development of agricultural production and transportation.

    山西调整乡行政区划
    据新华社太原14日电　山西省农村乡行政区划的调整已结束。
    潞安县由原来的一百四十个乡调整为四十个乡后，仅减少田地上的塄堰、小道，修改河道，使耕地连片，就增加了很多新耕地。大同市古店乡的孤山村和山底乡合并为一个乡以后，扩大耕地面积三百多亩，还使多年来的水利纠纷得到解决。
    经过乡的调整，各乡都相对地增加了有经验的领导骨干。过去由于乡单位太多太乱，各县对乡的领导不密切不及时，也经调整后完全解决。
    这次调整农村乡行政区划是根据各当地自然条件和农业生产发展远景进行调整的。它对系统利用自然条件、发展农业生产和交通事业都极为有利。
