Strive for Friendship and Peace Between Peoples
Vice President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, Sisa Nabalawi (Egypt)
    Since ancient times, China and Egypt have been connected by close ties of friendship. The cultural exchanges and trade during the most glorious eras of our two countries' histories allowed our ancient cultures to spread in both countries.
    However, this friendship was severed from the day we were subjected to foreign rule or influence.
    Today, this friendship makes our people feel very satisfied. This is something new. In the relationship between Asian and African countries that were still under the yoke of Western imperialism yesterday, it marks a decisive turning point. At the Bandung Conference, the people of Asian and African countries finally united, determined to liberate themselves from all foreign rule, and for the happiness of their children and the peace of the world, they decided to cooperate as they had in the past.
    Putting the principles adopted at this conference into practice is of great significance in human history. The Egyptian government, headed by Egyptian Prime Minister Gamal Abdel Nasser, decided to establish relations with the People's Republic of China, which is the foundation for cultural and trade exchanges between our two peoples.
    I left Egypt at the time of the opening of the Chinese commodity exhibition. Along the Qasr El Nil Bridge, the red flag of the People's Republic of China fluttered beside our national flag, symbolizing the peaceful and friendly coexistence, which guarantees peace, happiness, and prosperity for our children.
    In Cairo, the warmly welcomed and fascinating performances by Peking Opera artists and members of the Islamic Cultural Troupe have also helped to reconnect the friendship between our two peoples, who have extremely close relations.
    If the Bandung Conference—where one cannot fail to mention your Premier Zhou Enlai's reconciliation efforts—can form a united front of peace-loving people from Asia and Africa to oppose imperialism and those preparing for new wars, then we will also have the strength to resist those forces that have been insulting us and attempting to enslave us again.
    In the Middle East, in order to defend the oil wells and spheres of influence of the great powers, they have tried their best in recent years to drag us into the so-called defensive Baghdad Pact military bloc. This treaty serves the interests of imperialism and can therefore only be regarded as a treaty of aggression. To bring the rich and strategically important region under Western rule—the Baghdad Pact is a typical example of this aggressive attempt.
    Recognizing the danger that this treaty brings to the region, Egypt explicitly refused to participate in it. Syria and Saudi Arabia firmly stood on this side and signed a defense treaty with Egypt.
    Despite the use of financial aid, political or economic pressure, none of this can shake the will of these three countries to defend their complete national independence and the threatened world peace. It is precisely because of their firm opposition and the heroic struggle of the Jordanian people that the Baghdad Pact has immediately become a piece of waste paper that should be torn up.
    If the awakened people all hate the prospect of a new disaster that will drag humanity into pain and despair, then people will know that the forces of peace in the world will thwart the evil attempts of warmongers.
    In order to warn everyone to be vigilant against the dangers of war that are threatening us, large-scale conferences convened regularly by organizations such as the World Peace Congress, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and other peace groups have done a lot of work.
    Today, they are aware of the results of their prudent actions. In every corner of the world, men and women unanimously demand the prohibition of the use and manufacture of atomic weapons, the cessation of nuclear weapons testing, and the adoption of negotiation methods to resolve international issues.
    In order to resolve international conflicts, as well as to achieve general disarmament, the cooperation and peaceful coexistence of all peoples is needed, rather than the use of force.
    The results of the widespread signature campaign for peace by tens of millions of people have forced their governments, under the pressure of their people, to modify their policies.
    It is precisely because of this that hostilities have ceased in Korea and Vietnam, and these two war-torn countries have finally seen their freedom. Under the influence of the people's will, which is always the most resolute and sensitive, the heads of government of the four major powers met in Geneva last summer and discussed current issues. And it is generally acknowledged that the day is not far off when the government of the People's China will finally be invited to participate in such discussions.
    Today, it is North Africa's turn to shatter the shackles of colonial rule. Morocco and Tunisia have gained independence. As for Algeria, it is waging a heroic struggle to shatter the chains of colonialism imposed on its country.
    The detente that is emerging in international relations is strengthening day by day due to the frequent contacts between men, women, and young people from all countries and all social strata.
    In recent months, mutual visits by government members, intellectuals, journalists, scientific groups, trade groups, sports and art delegations from Eastern and Western countries have greatly helped to dispel the distrust that separates them and has helped to build understanding and trust that can serve as the basis for beneficial cooperation.
    The Asian-African Conference held in Bandung and the ten principles it promulgated, as I mentioned, marked an important stage in the relationship between East and West.
    The Asian-African Conference proclaimed the end of the colonial system, which is recognized by everyone as dirty, and wrote down the decision to defend world peace. It also showed the brotherly cooperation and the dawn of freedom between the Asian and African peoples.
    I am convinced that if political leaders can use common treaties to make the spirit of reconciliation and detente triumph in the world, then the women gathered in Beijing, returning to their respected countries, can also act as messengers of friendship and mutual understanding between peoples.
    This meeting of the Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation has been delayed for a few days, but representatives from all corners of the earth have had the opportunity to get to know each other, recognize their problems, and finally find things that bring them closer together better than things that separate them.
    They respect the kind Chinese women, who have been freed from the chains of slavery and who today participate in building their country with equal status. What a role women play in peace, progress, and work in building a better world!
    Thank you, dear Chinese sisters, for your hospitable hospitality, your moving enthusiastic hospitality, and your insightful talent. The richest hopeful prospects were unveiled at this conference in Beijing. How can one not believe that the human family is united and indivisible after meeting extraordinary women, seeing innocent babies who make you happy and lovely, and smiling girls who have confidence in the future!
    We should use all our strength to protect this family from death and destruction.
    The meeting of the Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation held in Beijing should, like the Bandung Conference, mark a new progress in international relations and open up a new era of cooperation for peace, prosperity, and happiness for mankind.

    争取人民之间的友谊与和平
    国际民主妇女联合会副主席  西萨·纳巴拉奥维（埃及）
    自远古以来，中国和埃及就由密切的友谊关系联接起来。我们两国历史上最光荣的时代的文化交流和贸易来往，使我们的古老文化得以在两国流传。
    但是，自从受到外国统治或影响的那一天起，这种友谊关系就断绝了。
    今天，这种友谊关系使得我们人民感到非常满意。这是一件新鲜的事物。在昨天还处于西方帝国主义枷锁下的亚非国家间的关系中，标志着一种决定性的转折。在万隆会议上，亚非国家的人民终于团结起来，他们决定从一切外国统治下把自己解放出来，并且为了他们孩子们的幸福和世界的和平，他们决定像过去一样共同合作。
    把这次会议通过的原则付诸实现，这在人类历史上是有重大意义的。以埃及总理加麦尔·阿卜杜勒·纳赛尔为首的埃及政府决定同中华人民共和国建立联系，这是我们两国人民之间文化和贸易交流的基础。
    我是在中国商品展览会开幕的时候，离开埃及的。沿着卡斯·艾尔·尼罗河大桥，中华人民共和国的红旗在我们的国旗旁飘扬着，象征着和平和友谊的共处，这种共处给我们孩子保证了和平、幸福和繁荣。
    在开罗，受到热烈欢迎的引人入胜的京剧艺术家们的演出和回教文工团团员们的演出，同样有助于把我们两国有极深密关系的人民间的友谊重新联接起来。
    假如万隆会议——在这里不能不提到你们总理周恩来的和解行动——能够结成一条亚非爱好和平人民的统一战线，来反对帝国主义和新战争准备者的话，那么我们也就有力量来反抗那些一直侮辱我们的、企图重新奴役我们的势力。
    在中东，为了保卫大国的油井和势力范围，它们竭力想在最近几年把我们拉进所谓防御性的巴格达军事条约集团。这个条约是为帝国主义利益服务的，因此只能被认为是侵略条约。为了把富饶的具有重要战略价值的地区划归西方统治——巴格达条约就是这种侵略企图的典型例子。
    由于了解到这种条约带给这个地区的危险，埃及明确地拒绝参加这个条约。叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯坚决站在这方面，并同埃及签订了防御条约。
    尽管有人利用财政援助，政治或经济的压力，但都不能动摇这三国保卫他们国家的完全独立和受到威胁的世界和平的意志。正是由于他们的坚决反对和约旦人民英勇的斗争，才使得巴格达条约立刻成为应该撕毁的废纸。
    如果说，觉醒了的人民都痛恨把人类拖进痛苦和失望中的新灾难的远景的话，那么人们就晓得世界的和平力量会挫败好战分子的罪恶企图。
    为了警告大家警惕在威胁着我们的战争的危险，由庞大的组织定期召开的大会，例如，世界和平大会，国际民主妇女联合会和其他一些和平团体都作了很多工作。
    今天，他们意识到了他们谨慎行动的成果。世界每个角落，男人和女人都一致要求禁止使用和制造原子武器，停止试验核子武器，采用谈判方法来解决国际问题。
    为了解决国际冲突，同时普遍裁军，需要一切人民的合作和和平共处，而不使用武力。
    千万人为了和平的广泛签名运动的结果，迫使他们的政府，在他们人民的压力下，不得不修改他们的政策。
    正因为这样，在朝鲜和越南才停止了敌对行动，而这两个受了战争创伤的国家终于看到了他们的自由。在永远是最坚决和最敏感的人民意志的影响下，四大国政府首脑去年夏天在日内瓦会晤并讨论了当前的问题。并且大家公认，人民中国政府终于会被邀请参加这种讨论的日子已不远了。
    今天，轮到在北非粉碎殖民统治的枷锁了。摩洛哥和突尼斯获得独立。至于阿尔及利亚，它为了粉碎殖民主义加在它国家身上的锁链，正在作着英勇的斗争。
    由于所有的国家和各个社会阶层的男人、女人和青年之间频繁的接触，在国际关系中出现的缓和正在一天天加强。
    最近几个月来，东西方各国政府议员，知识分子、新闻记者、科学团体、贸易团体、体育和艺术等代表团的互相访问，大大地有助于驱散使他们分开的不信任，并且有助于建立能够作为有益的合作的基础的了解和信任。
    在万隆召开的亚非会议和它公布的十项原则，像我谈到的那样，在东西方之间的关系中标志着一个重要的阶段。
    亚非会议宣告了被大家公认为肮脏的殖民主义制度的结束，并写下了保卫世界和平的决定，它也显示出亚非人民之间兄弟般的合作和自由的黎明。
    我确信，假如政治领袖们能够用共同的条约来使和解和和缓精神在世界取得胜利的话，那么聚集在北京的妇女们，回到她们受人尊敬的国家里也同样能作人民之间的友谊和互相了解的使者。
    这一次国际民主妇女联合会理事会会议多延迟了几天，可是地球上各个角落的代表们有机会来相互了解，认清她们的问题，终于找出了使她们接近比使她们分开更好的东西。
    她们尊敬善良的中国妇女们，中国妇女从奴隶的锁链下解放出来，并且今天以同样平等的地位参加建设她们的国家。在建设一个美好的世界中，妇女对和平、进步和工作是起着怎样的作用！
    谢谢你们，亲爱的中国姊妹们，由于你们的好客的款待，你们动人的热情的招待和你们明敏的天资，在北京这次大会上揭开了最丰富的希望远景。会见了不平凡的妇女，看到了使你快活可爱的天真的婴儿和对未来抱有信心的微笑着的少女，怎能使人不相信人类的大家庭是统一的和不可分割的呢！
    我们应该用尽全部力量来保卫这个大家庭免于死亡和破坏。
    在北京召开的国际民主妇女联合会理事会会议应该像万隆会议一样，在国际关系中标志着一个新的进步，并且给人类开辟了和平、繁荣和幸福的合作的新纪元。
