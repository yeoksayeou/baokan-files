Through the Advanced Production Movement to Green the Motherland
　　-- Excerpts from Liang Xi's Speech at the National Conference of Advanced Producers

In his speech at the National Conference of Advanced Producers on the 5th, Minister of Forestry Liang Xi proposed that the great plan to green the motherland should be accomplished through the advanced production movement. He said that after the afforestation this spring, the national afforestation plan has been completed ahead of schedule and exceeded the Five-Year Plan, which has created favorable conditions for greening the motherland in the future.

He said that in the forest industry, this movement should also enable the majority of employees to master mechanical technology, improve labor productivity, reduce costs, and increase the utilization rate of timber.

In his speech at the conference, Liang Xi also mentioned that some forest industry bureaus have already increased production quotas. For example, the felling quota has been increased from 4.7 cubic meters to 6.4 cubic meters, and the timber collection quota has been increased from 4.9 cubic meters to 6 cubic meters. Now, some units are not only satisfied with completing tasks, but also pay more attention to improving quality, reducing costs, and increasing labor productivity.

Liang Xi said that in terms of forestry, employees from 40 forest industry bureaus across the country have participated in inter-bureau competitions, and employees from 10 types of work have participated in intra-industry competitions. Employees participating in the socialist competition account for 90% of the total number of forestry employees in the country. In the competition, 9,743 advanced producers, 771 advanced groups, and 95 advanced workshops have also emerged.

In his speech, Liang Xi, on behalf of the Ministry of Forestry, extended sincere respect to the national advanced producer representatives and the Soviet advanced producer representatives who were invited to our country.

    林业部部长梁希五日在全国先进生产者代表会议上的讲话中提出，要通过先进生产运动来完成绿化祖国的伟大计划。他说全国造林，经过今春的造林以后，已经提前和超额完成五年计划，这为今后绿化祖国创造了有利条件。
    他说在森林工业方面，也要通过这一运动使广大职工掌握机械技术，提高劳动生产率，降低成本，增加木材利用率。
    梁希在这个会议上的讲话中，还提到有些森林工业局已经把生产定额提高了。如采伐定额从四点七立方公尺提高到六点四立方公尺，集材定额从四点九立方公尺提高六立方公尺。现在，有些单位不仅以完成任务为满足，而且进一步注意提高质量，降低成本，提高劳动生产率。
    梁希说，在林业方面，全国已经有四十个森林工业局的职工参加了局际竞赛，有十个工种的职工参加同工种竞赛。参加社会主义竞赛的职工，占全国林业职工总数的90％。在竞赛中，还出现了9，743名先进生产者，771个先进小组，95个先进车间。
    梁希在讲话中，代表林业部向全国先进生产者代表和应邀来我国的苏联先进生产者代表致真诚的敬意。
