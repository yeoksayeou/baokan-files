    28.6% of the employees of the Shenyang Transformer Factory were promoted in the first quarter of this year due to improvements in their technical and professional skills. Among these promoted employees, workers accounted for 57%, technicians accounted for 16%, and staff members accounted for 27%. Technician Shao Shixun was not only able to complete his own work tasks, but also improved the structure of a transformer based on advanced Soviet experience, which can reduce the cost of each transformer by 6,500 yuan. This time he was promoted by two grades.
    The implementation of the piece-rate wage system in this factory has also expanded from production workshops to auxiliary workshops. In March, the number of people implementing the piece-rate wage system accounted for 55% of the total number of workers and 85% of the total number of workers who could implement the piece-rate wage system. The number of people implementing the piece-rate wage system has increased by more than half compared to December last year. Calculated according to standard wages, the implementation of the piece-rate wage system has increased workers' monetary wage income by 23.2%.
