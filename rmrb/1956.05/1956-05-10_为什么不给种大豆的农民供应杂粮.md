Why Not Supply Coarse Grains to Soybean Farmers?
    Hu Guang

    The "People's Daily" published an editorial on April 15th, titled "Plant Soybeans According to Plan," calling on all regions not to neglect soybean planting. We believe that this issue is raised very timely. The soybean planting area in Shandong is indeed showing a trend of significant reduction. The main reason is that farmers in soybean-growing areas cannot get a supply of coarse grains, so they are unwilling to continue planting soybeans. For example, the Hongqi Agricultural Cooperative in Liying District, Jining County, planted 4,300 mu of soybeans last year, producing 860,000 jin of soybeans. After selling to the state and paying agricultural taxes, the remaining 670,000 jin of soybeans became the main food for the cooperative members. The members requested the grain department to adjust and supply coarse grains, but this was never resolved. Now they are all eating soybeans. Because soybeans are very oily, they are getting diarrhea. Therefore, when the cooperative cadres repeatedly mobilized the members to maintain last year's soybean planting area this year, the members firmly opposed it. This situation has been found in other districts and townships in Jining, as well as in Linyi, Shouzhang, and other places. The area along the Yellow River in Shouzhang County has sandy soil where other crops do not grow well, but it is suitable for planting soybeans. Last year's soybean planting was a bumper harvest. However, the farmers here cannot exchange soybeans for coarse grains now. Some push carts to Yanggu County, thirty or forty li away, to exchange them, and sometimes they cannot even exchange them. According to incomplete statistics from Liu Lou Township, Malou District, Shouzhang, more than thirty farmers go out every day to exchange soybeans for coarse grains. During the busy farming season, having so many people go out to exchange grain will inevitably hinder timely agricultural production. If farmers who go out to exchange grain are misunderstood by the tax bureau as being involved in grain trafficking, there will be more trouble and more production time will be wasted.

    The Shandong Provincial Grain Bureau is aware of these situations. However, they say that they have made great efforts, saying that to fundamentally solve the problem of coarse grain supply in these areas, they should, on the one hand, appropriately reduce the soybean planting area in these areas, and on the other hand, request the Ministry of Food to solve the problem (something to that effect). The Provincial Grain Bureau did indeed adjust some coarse grains to these areas, but the quantity was very small and far from meeting the needs of soybean farmers in these areas. The grain department also emphasized adjusting coarse grains through the national grain market, but more than 80% of the grain in the national grain markets in these areas is also soybeans. The grain department is not actively adjusting grain, but many speculative grain merchants are taking the opportunity to become active. Now, in the Shouzhang area, many grain merchants have been found to be trafficking grain again, raising grain prices.

    Farmers in soybean-growing areas in Shandong Province have not been able to fully obtain a supply of coarse grains for several years. Why has this problem not been solved in several years? We hope that the Shandong Provincial Grain Bureau and the Ministry of Food can give the farmers in these areas an answer.

### 为什么不给种大豆的农民供应杂粮

　　为什么不给种大豆的农民供应杂粮
    胡光
    “人民日报”四月十五日发表了“按照计划播种大豆”的社论，号召各地不要忽视大豆的种植。我们认为这一问题提得很适时。山东大豆的播种面积的确有大大减少的趋势。主要原因是：种豆地区的农民得不到杂粮的供应，因此不愿再种大豆。例如，济宁县李营区红旗农业合作社，去年种了四千三百亩大豆，共产大豆86万斤，除卖给国家的和缴纳农业税的以外，剩余的67万斤大豆就成了社员的主要口粮。社员们要求粮食部门调剂杂粮，但始终没有得到解决。现在他们吃的全是大豆。由于大豆的油性很大，他们吃得都泻肚子。因此，今年社干部反复动员社员保持去年的大豆播种面积的时候，社员们就坚决反对。这种情况在济宁的其他区乡以及在临沂、寿张等地都有发现。寿张县沿黄河一带是沙土地，别的庄稼都不长，只适合种大豆，去年种的大豆就获得了丰收。但是这里的农民现在用大豆换不到粗粮，有的推着车到三、四十里远的阳谷县去换，有时还换不到。据寿张马楼区刘楼乡的不完全统计，每天到外地用大豆换粗粮的农民有三十多名。在农忙季节，有这样多的人出外换粮，就不能不妨碍适时进行农业生产。出外换粮的农民，如果被税务局误会是贩运粮食，就会有更多麻烦，耽误更多的生产时间。
    山东省粮食厅是了解这些情况的。但是他们说他们已经尽了很大努力，说要根本解决这些地区的杂粮供应问题，就应该一方面适当减少这些地区的大豆播种面积，一方面提请粮食部解决（大意如此）。省粮食厅的确也曾调剂了一些杂粮给这些地区，但是数量极少，远远不能满足这些地区种豆农民的需要。粮食部门还强调通过国家粮食市场调剂杂粮，但是这些地区的国家粮食市场上80％以上也都是大豆。粮食部门不积极调剂粮食，不少投机粮商却乘机活跃起来了。现在寿张县一带就发现不少粮商又开始贩运粮食，抬高粮价。
    山东省种大豆地区的农民不能充分得到杂粮供应，已经连续有几年了。这个问题为什么在几年之内都不能解决呢？我们希望山东省粮食厅和粮食部能够给这些地区的农民一个答复。
