Over six thousand advanced producers unanimously passed an open letter to all workers across the country at today's meeting. The letter called on all workers to use the great spirit of "making mountains bow their heads and rivers give way" to overcome all difficulties and build China into a completely modern, prosperous, and powerful socialist industrial nation. In the letter, they also assured all workers across the country that they would forever cherish the honor given to them by the Party and the state, study diligently, never be arrogant, and be willing to advance further and further on the glorious road of socialism together with all workers across the country!

The closing ceremony was held at 3:10 PM.

Zhu Xuefan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered the closing speech at the conference. He said that the gains of this conference were abundant. This conference will surely promote the vigorous and sustained development of the advanced producer movement in our country, and it will also have a profound impact on our country's socialist construction cause. In his speech, Zhu Xuefan called on all representatives to engage in socialist construction with a new attitude towards labor and new moral qualities, giving fuller play to their initiative and creativity.

Over three hundred Young Pioneers from the capital, holding flowers, entered the venue in formation. They represented all the Young Pioneers of the capital in presenting two flower baskets to the people who were creating happiness for them. In their presentation speech, they also made sincere requests to all advanced producers: Please remember firmly that tens of thousands of red scarf hearts are waiting for you, hoping that you will do more work and create more miracles in your different positions, so that the motherland will become more and more beautiful day by day, and that socialism and communism will arrive sooner!

All the representatives responded to the children's ardent expectations with lasting applause.
