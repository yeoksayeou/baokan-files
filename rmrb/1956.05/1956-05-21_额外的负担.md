    Additional Burdens

    Some organs and units treat newly established agricultural production cooperatives as "millionaires" and impose many expenses on them that they should not bear, causing great dissatisfaction among the members of the agricultural cooperatives.

    Such a thing happened in Yibin County, Sichuan Province: The County Committee of the Communist Youth League established a Young Pioneers team in the Gaoli Agricultural Production Cooperative. The money for the team flag and red scarves of the Young Pioneers should have been provided by the team members themselves or paid from the team fees. However, the comrades of the County Committee of the Communist Youth League asked the agricultural cooperative to pay the money. The mobile film projection team showed movies in the countryside. Once, because the notice was too late, only 100 tickets were sold out of 800. Later, the person in charge of this film team forced four agricultural cooperatives to share the cost of the unsold movie tickets. The members said with indignation: "We didn't watch the movie, why should we pay?"

    Many townships in Yibin County have added three or four accounting instructors who are detached from production. Each person's salary of fifteen or sixteen yuan per month is paid by the agricultural cooperative. Although postal and transportation services are very convenient in some townships, they also set up postmen in a formalistic way. Some postmen have not delivered newspapers and letters to the members even once in more than two months. These postmen also have to be paid monthly salaries by the agricultural cooperatives.

    It is obviously unreasonable to put such additional burdens on agricultural cooperatives. This increases the burden on the peasants. All regions that discover such practices must quickly correct them.

    额外的负担
    纪希晨
    有些机关和单位把办起来不久的农业生产合作社就看成是“百万富翁”，把许多不应由它们负担的开支也加在它们身上，引起农业合作社社员的极大不满。
    四川省宜宾县就发生过这样的事情：青年团县委在高梨农业生产合作社建立少先队，少先队的队旗和红领巾钱，本来应该由队员自备或从队费中开支，可是，县团委的同志却叫农业合作社开支了这笔钱。电影流动放映队在乡下演电影，有一次，因为通知太晚，八百张票只卖了一百张。后来，这个电影队的负责人，就强迫四个农业合作社分摊了没有卖掉的电影票钱。社员们都愤慨地说：“我们没看电影，为什么要出钱？”
    宜宾县许多乡都增设了三、四个脱离生产的会计辅导员，每人每月要由农业合作社开支薪金十五、六元。有些乡虽然邮政交通十分方便，可是也都形式主义地设立起邮递员，有的邮递员两个多月没给社员投送过一次报纸信件。这些邮递员也要由农业合作社每月付给薪水。
    把这样一些额外负担加到农业合作社的身上显然是不合理的。这样就加重了农民的负担。凡是发现有这类做法的地区，都要赶快纠正。
