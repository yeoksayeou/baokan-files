Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 17th: According to Antara News Agency, the Indonesian Publishers Association issued a statement on May 16th, denouncing the insulting conditions imposed by the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia when issuing visas to six Indonesian journalists accompanying President Sukarno to the United States.

　　The statement said that these conditions violate and infringe upon freedom of the press and basic human rights. The conditions put forward by the embassy should also be seen as an insult to the journalists involved. These journalists were required to fill out questionnaires and guarantee that they would not do certain things during their stay in the United States, including having contact with American Communist leaders, discussing the American black issue, and engaging in sexual relations with American women.

    The statement by the Indonesian Publishers Association said that the conditions put forward by the United States constitute restrictions and insults to journalists, especially to those reporters who were selected to accompany the Indonesian President on his state visit to the United States. The statement further said that these conditions represent a blatant violation of freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and freedom to gather information. As for the guarantee not to engage in sexual relations with American women, this is a "serious infringement on the prestige and honor of the journalists involved, as well as a serious infringement on the prestige and honor of the entire press corps, the Indonesian press, and the Indonesian people."

    抗议美国侮辱印度尼西亚记者
    新华社雅加达17日电　据安塔拉通讯社消息：印度尼西亚出版者协会五月十六日发表了一篇声明，指责美国驻印度尼西亚大使馆在发签证给随苏加诺总统到美国去的六名印度尼西亚新闻工作者的时候所加的侮辱性条件。
  　声明说，这种条件是违背和侵犯新闻自由和基本人权的。大使馆所提出的条件也应该看作是对有关新闻工作者的一种侮辱。这些新闻工作者曾被要求填写问题表和保证在美国期间不做某些事情，这些事情中包括不同美国共产党领袖们发生接触，不谈美国的黑人问题和不同美国妇女发生性关系。
    印度尼西亚出版者协会的声明说，美国所提出的条件构成了对新闻工作者的限制和侮辱，对于被挑选出来随同美国国宾印度尼西亚总统前去的那些记者说来更加是如此。声明又说，这些条件意味着公开侵犯新闻自由、言论自由和收集消息的自由。至于不同美国妇女发生性关系这种保证，这是“对有关新闻工作者的威信和荣誉的严重侵害，也是对整个记者团和印度尼西亚报界和印度尼西亚人民的威信和荣誉的严重侵害”。
