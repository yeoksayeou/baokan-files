    Xinhua News Agency, May 29th, Paris Dispatch: On May 28th, workers in Saint-Nazaire, an important port city on the French Atlantic coast, held demonstrations and strikes to protest the military suppression in Algeria by the French government.
    Several thousand metalworkers and construction workers demonstrated at the Saint-Nazaire train station, preventing a train carrying twenty reserve soldiers to Algeria from departing. Police and security forces attacked the demonstrators with tear gas, rifle butts, and batons, but the crowd persisted. The train was delayed for two hours. Several reserve soldiers joined the demonstrators' ranks, refusing to board the train and returning home with the demonstrating masses.
    On the same day, 18,000 heavy industrial workers in the city went on strike to protest the Mollet government's policy towards Algeria.
    In the towns of Saint-Gervais, Bellegarde, Vendôme, and others in eastern France, mass demonstrations also occurred, hindering the departure of trains carrying reserve soldiers to Algeria.
