    Scientific Achievements and Scientific Activities
    New Metals - Titanium and Barium Alloys
    Titanium's strength is similar to that of structural steel, but its specific gravity is only about 56% of iron. Therefore, in terms of unit strength, titanium and titanium alloys surpass all structural metal materials. The high-temperature performance of titanium and titanium alloys far exceeds aluminum and magnesium alloys, second only to stainless steel. When aircraft speed exceeds twice the speed of sound, the surface temperature will exceed 450 degrees Celsius. At this point, aluminum, magnesium, and other alloys can no longer be used and titanium must be used. In other national defense aspects, such as tanks and guns, there is also a trend to use large amounts of titanium. Due to titanium's corrosion resistance to seawater and many acids, titanium also has great prospects in the navy and the chemical industry.
    Due to the special properties of titanium, its production method is different from general structural metal materials. The current industrial production method is the magnesium reduction method of titanium tetrachloride. The sodium reduction method and electrolysis method are under development. In terms of alloying elements, manganese, iron, chromium, molybdenum, vanadium, aluminum, and tin are currently more widely used. The first four are known as the four major alloying elements. The melting and casting and processing technology of titanium and titanium alloys is also more complicated. Because titanium is chemically active, inert oxygen must be widely used in reduction, melting, casting, and heating.
    Currently, the price of sponge titanium is about 20 times that of aluminum ingots, so smelting methods must be improved to reduce costs. The high-temperature performance and elastic modulus of titanium alloys also need to be researched and improved. These are important issues facing scientists. Chinese scientists are beginning to conduct this research work.

    Hypothermia Anesthesia
    Hypothermia anesthesia is the newest anesthesia method. That is, using drugs or freezing methods to lower body temperature to a certain degree, and then perform surgery. Under low-temperature conditions, like lower animals in hibernation, the function of metabolism is reduced, the response to external stimuli is reduced, and anesthetics can be used less or not used at all for surgery. It can also prevent shock caused by surgical damage. Its greatest use is in performing heart surgery under hypothermia anesthesia.
    The heart is the main organ of the body's blood circulation. Its beating distributes blood throughout the body, and blood from the whole body flows to the heart. A person's heart pumps more than five liters of blood per minute, which is equal to the total amount of blood in the body. If you cut open the heart for surgery, blood will inevitably gush out, which hinders the development of heart surgery.
    Clamping the veins connected to the heart to block the flow of blood to the heart can cut open the heart without bleeding. However, blocking the flow of blood deprives all tissues of oxygen. The brain is the most important tissue in the body, and its tolerance to hypoxia is the worst. It will cause irreversible damage after more than five minutes. It is difficult to complete heart surgery within five minutes.
    Hypothermia anesthesia reduces the metabolic function of tissues, and the need for oxygen is also reduced. In this way, blood flow can be blocked for 25-30 minutes, which is enough time to perform major heart surgery.
    There are different ways to lower body temperature. The simplest is to put the patient in a cold water bath after anesthetizing them to lose consciousness. When the patient's body temperature drops to about 30 degrees Celsius, they are taken out of the water, dried, and sent to the operating room for surgery. The operating room does not require special cooling equipment. The patient's body temperature will generally continue to drop by 2-4 degrees and can be maintained for several hours.
    In the Soviet Union, hypothermia anesthesia has entered the stage of clinical application from animal experiments. Chinese surgeons and anesthesiologists are engaged in the research of this new method. In the near future, hypothermia anesthesia will also be used in China.

    Television in Modern Science
    The basic principle of television is similar to that of radio facsimile: As long as you carefully observe the photos in the newspaper, it is easy to find that any image is actually composed of small dots of different brightness. Therefore, the different brightness of each small dot can be turned into electrical signals of different strengths according to a certain order, transmitted to distant places, and then, at the receiving place, the electrical signals are restored to the brightness of light in the same order to obtain the same image. However, television and radio facsimile have fundamental differences in the method of realizing this principle. Therefore, facsimile can only transmit still pictures, while television can truly present moving scenes to the audience.
    The most common application of television is television broadcasting, which is already quite widespread in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and many capitalist countries. In the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, television broadcasting not only allows the working people to see the most exciting dramas, songs, dances, and movies at home, but also uses television to promote advanced production experience and improve the cultural and technical level of the working people.
    Television broadcasting is just one of many applications of television.
    In industry, television is widely used to observe certain production processes that are harmful to the human body, such as nuclear reactions, toxic chemical reactions, etc. Installing a television lens in these places allows people to observe from a distance. Television is also used to observe production processes that were originally invisible. For example, television can be used to directly display the combustion situation of the boiler to the staff for timely adjustment. In addition, television has special applications in production scheduling, the mining industry, and oil drilling. Practice has proven that these applications have great economic value.
    The development of underwater television has significant value to the national economy. If an underwater television lens can be lowered to inspect the construction of underwater projects or to check the quality of underwater projects, this has great practical significance in China's huge water conservancy projects such as the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Television can also be used to study underwater organisms. The nutritional value of certain marine plants is the same as that of wheat. The value of studying these plants to the food problem is self-evident. China has a long coastline. It is foreseeable that underwater television will have great development in China in the near future.
    Television has many other important applications in education, medicine, biology, astronomy, transportation, navigation, scientific research, etc. For example, television universities have been established in countries such as Czechoslovakia. The characteristic of television universities is that there is no limit to the number of students, so it has a special and important role in training cadres.
    In some respects, the role of modern television far exceeds that of the human eye. Human vision can only occur in the presence of visible light. People cannot see objects in the dark or in dense fog; however, television equipment in the infrared range can accurately reflect objects in these situations.
    Television is also of great significance in national defense.
    The characteristic of modern television is not only its wide range of applications, but also that it is paving the way for the development of certain sciences. The major achievements in the research of color television and stereoscopic television in recent years have opened up magnificent prospects for television. The future development of science and technology and the improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the working people will largely depend on television. Now all countries in the world regard television as one of the important scientific departments. The application of television in China has also been put on the agenda.

    Non-woven Fabric - New Uses of Polymers
    Czechoslovakia has recently researched a new method of making cloth. That is, a layer of cotton web and a layer of polyvinyl chloride—a polymer compound—are pressed together at an appropriate temperature to make cloth. The thickness of this cloth is related to the thickness of the cotton web, and its color pattern comes from polyvinyl chloride. In this way, cloth making not only saves the weaving process but also saves the printing and dyeing process. This kind of cloth is a bit like velvet, breathable, washable, and has bright and lasting colors. It can be made into clothes by ordinary sewing or welding. (Ren)
    Preparations for the International Geophysical Year
    From July 1, 1957, to the end of December 1958 is the International Geophysical Year. Scientists from many countries are currently actively preparing for the International Geophysical Year. In this upcoming year, scientists from various countries will conduct extensive observations of physical phenomena on land, sea, and air according to a jointly agreed-upon unified plan and method. The International Geophysical Year inherited the fine tradition of international scientific cooperation from the previous two International Polar Years (August 1882 to August 1883; August 1932 to August 1933), and has had a broader development in the scale and items of observation. According to the report of the International Committee for the International Geophysical Year, which leads and coordinates this work, the currently determined observation projects include twelve items: meteorology, geomagnetism, aurora and airglow, ionosphere, solar activity, cosmic rays, longitude and latitude, glaciology, oceanography, rockets and satellites, seismology, and gravimetry. At that time, more than two thousand stations in fifty countries, including the Soviet Union, China, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, will simultaneously conduct observations during "World Days" and other specified times, with special emphasis on areas where there is less observation data in the past, such as the Arctic and Antarctic (especially the Antarctic), carrying out unprecedented large-scale work. Undoubtedly, the large amount of data obtained from the observations and their research will be of great significance for further revealing the mysteries of various physical phenomena on the earth, as well as for various aspects of human life. For example, in meteorology, we can better study the basic circulation of the atmosphere and the exchange process of heat, momentum, angular momentum and ? on the earth, which will promote the solution of some basic problems in long-term weather forecasting; and research on the morphology of ionospheric and geomagnetic disturbances (including magnetic storms, magnetic bays, and pulsations) is directly related to radio communication.
    Last year, China has participated in the International Committee of the International Geophysical Year as a formal member, and has formed the National Committee of the International Geophysical Year, chaired by Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, to lead this work. Preparations are now underway. It is expected that more than fifty stations will participate in observations of various projects at that time. These stations plan to use the latest instruments for observation. For example, some meteorological stations plan to use radar sounding and radio wind measurement equipment to make high-altitude wind observations reach 20-30 kilometers; some observatories plan to use the best quality quartz clocks to improve timing accuracy to more than one-thousandth of a second.

    科学成就和科学活动
    新金属——钛和钡合金
    钛的强度和结构钢相仿，但是它的比重大约只有铁的56％，因此以单位强度论，钛和钛合金超过一切结构金属材料。钛和钛合金的高温性能远远超过铝合金和镁合金而仅次于不锈钢。当飞机速度超过两倍音速的时候，表面温度将超过摄氏450度，这时铝、镁等合金已经不能应用，而必须用钛。其他国防方面如坦克枪炮等也有大量用钛的趋势。由于钛对海水及许多酸类的抗腐性能，钛在海军和化学工业方面也有远大的前途。
    由于钛的性质特殊，它的生产方法不同于一般结构金属材料。现今的工业生产方法为四氯化钛用镁还原法，钠还原法及电解法正在发展中。合金元素方面，锰、铁、铬、钼、钒、铝、锡是现在使用得较为广泛的，前四个有四大合金元素之称。钛和钛合金的熔铸和加工工艺也是比较复杂的，由于钛的性质活泼，还原、熔铸以及加热，必须广泛地使用惰性氧体。
    目前海绵钛的价格约为铝锭的20倍，因此必须改进冶炼方法以降低成本。钛合金的高温性能和弹性系数也还须研究改进。这些都是科学家所面临的重要课题。我国科学家正开始进行这项研究工作。

    低温麻醉
    低温麻醉是一种最新的麻醉方法，即是用药物或冷冻的方法将体温降至一定的程度，然后施行手术。在低温情况下，好像低级动物在冬眠状态的时候一样，新陈代谢的功能降低，对外界刺激反应减少，可以不用或少用麻醉剂进行手术，而且可以防止因手术损伤而产生的休克，它的最大的用途是在低温麻醉下作心脏手术。
    心脏是全身血液循环的主要器官。它的跳动使血液分布全身，而全身的血液又向心脏奔流。一个人的心脏每分钟排血量在五公升以上，也就等于全身所有的血量。如果切开心脏做手术，势必使血液汹涌而出，这种情况阻碍了心脏手术的开展。
    把和心脏相连的静脉夹住以阻断向心的血流，是可以切开心脏而不流血的。但是阻断血流以后，全身组织就失去了氧的供应。脑是全身最主要的组织，它对缺氧的耐受力最差，超过五分钟后就造成不可恢复的损伤。要在五分钟内完成心脏手术是有困难的。
    低温麻醉使组织的新陈代谢功能降低，需氧量也就减少。这样，可以阻断血流25—30分钟，这就有足够的时间进行较大的心脏手术。
    降低体温的方法不一，最简单的是将病人用麻醉剂使其失去知觉后放入冷水浴盆中。当病人体温降至摄氏30度左右的时候，将其抬出水外，擦干后送手术室进行手术。手术室并不需要特殊降温设备，病人的体温一般将继续下降2—4度，而且能维持至数小时。
    低温麻醉在苏联已由动物实验进入临床应用的阶段了。我国的外科学家和麻醉学家正在从事这一新方法的研究。在不久的将来，低温麻醉也会在我国应用起来。
                            （黄家驷）
    现代科学中的电视
    电视的基本原理和无线电传真相似：只要留心观察报纸上的相片，就很容易发现，任何图像实际上都是由一个个明暗不同的小点所组成，因此可以按照一定的次序将各小点的不同亮度变成强弱不同的电信号，传向远方，然后在接收的地方，再按同样的次序将电信号恢复成光的明暗，得到同样的图像。但是电视和无线电传真在实现这个原理的方法上有着根本的差别，因此传真只能传送不动的图片，而电视则能够将活动的景物真实地呈现在观众的面前。
    电视最普通的应用是电视广播，这在苏、捷、匈等国，及许多资本主义国家中，已经是相当广泛的了。在苏联及人民民主国家，电视广播不但使劳动人民在家里看到了最精彩的戏剧，歌舞、电影等，而且应用电视推广先进生产经验、提高了劳动人民的文化技术水平。
    电视广播只是电视很多的应用之一。
    在工业上，电视广泛用来观察某些对人体有害的生产过程，例如核子反应、有毒的化学反应等。在这些地方安装一个电视镜头，人就能在远方观察。电视还用来观察本来无法看到的生产过程，例如利用电视可以将锅炉的燃烧情形，直接显示给工作人员，以便及时地调节。此外电视在生产调度、采矿工业及石油钻探等等方面，都有特殊的应用。实践证明，这些应用具有很大的经济价值。
    水下电视的发展，对国民经济有重大的价值。如果沉下一个电视镜头可以检查水下工程的建设或检查水下工程的质量，这在我国黄河、长江等巨大的水利建设中有重大的实际意义。利用电视还可以研究水下生物。某些海底植物的营养价值和麦子相同，研究这些植物对粮食问题的价值是不言而喻的。我国有很长的海岸线，可以预料，在不久的将来，水下电视在我国一定会有很大发展。
    电视在教育、医学、生物学、天文学、交通运输、导航、科学研究等方面还有很多重要的应用。例如在捷克斯洛伐克等国家已经建立了用电视讲授的大学，电视大学的特点是无学生人数的限制，因此对培养干部有着特殊重要的作用。
    现代电视的作用在某些方面大大地超过了人的眼睛。人的视觉只能在存在可见光的情况下才能产生，人不能在黑暗中或浓雾中看到景物；但在红外线范围内的电视设备，可以把在这些情况下的景物一一准确地反应出来。
    电视在国防上也有重要意义。
    现代电视的特点不仅是它的应用范围很广，而且它正在为某些科学的发展开辟道路。近年来对彩色电视及立体电视研究的重大成就，更为电视展开了壮丽的远景。未来科学技术的发展，劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平的提高，在很大程度上将有赖于电视。现在世界各国都把电视作为重要的科学部门之一。电视在我国的应用，也已经提到日程上来了。

    不用纺织的布——高分子的新用途
    捷克斯洛伐克最近研究出一种制布的新方法。就是用一层棉网和一层聚氯乙烯——一种高分子化合物，在适当的温度下压在一起，这样就能制成布。这种布的厚薄度和棉网的厚薄有关，它的色彩花纹是来自聚氯乙烯。这样，制布不但省去了纺织手续，也省了印染手续。这种布有点像绒布，能透气、耐洗，花色鲜艳持久，可用普通缝纫的方法也可以用焊接的方法制成衣服。　　（仁）
    国际地球物理年的准备工作
    从1957年7月1日到1958年12月底是国际地球物理年。目前许多国家的科学家正在为国际地球物理年进行着积极的准备工作。在这样一个即将到来的年度里，各个国家的科学家们将根据共同商定的统一的计划和方法，对陆地、海洋和空中的物理现象进行广泛的观测。国际地球物理年继承了上两次国际极年（1882年8月至1883年8月；1932年8月至1933年8月）国际科学合作的优良传统，在观测的规模和项目上有了更广泛的发展。据领导和协调这一工作的国际地球物理年国际委员会的报道，目前确定的观测项目有气象学、地磁学、极光与气辉，电离层、太阳活动、宇宙线、经度及纬度、冰川学、海洋学、火箭及卫星、地震学、重力学等十二项，到时候将有包括苏、中、美、英、法等国在内的五十个国家的二千个以上的台站在“世界日”及其它规定时间内同时进行观测，其中还特别着重于过去观测资料较少的地区，如在北极和南极（尤其是南极），进行史无前例的大规模工作。无疑地，观测得到的大量资料及其研究工作，对于进一步揭露地球各个物理现象的奥秘，以及对于人类生活的各个方面将有很大的意义。例如，在气象方面，就可以更好地来研究大气基本环流和地球上热能、运动量、角动量与?的交换过程，这将促进长期天气预报若干基本问题的解决；又如对电离层和地磁扰动形态（包括磁暴、磁湾和脉动）等问题的研究，是和无线电通讯直接有关的。
    去年，我国已经作为一个正式会员参加了国际地球物理年国际委员会，并且组成了以中国科学院副院长竺可桢为主席的国际地球物理年国家委员会来领导这项工作。现在正在积极进行准备工作，预计到时将有五十个以上的台站参加各种项目的观测。这些台站打算使用最新式的仪器来观测，例如有些气象台站拟应用雷达探空和无线电测风等设备，使高空风的观测达到20—30公里；在某些天文台拟使用质量最好的石英钟，提高授时准确度到一千分之一秒以上。　（尤方）
