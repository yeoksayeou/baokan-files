Xinhua News Agency, May 26th. The Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries recently gifted eleven sets of Chinese women's clothing, along with a batch of clothing pictures and instructional materials, to the Japan-China Friendship Association.

In April, the Japan-China Friendship Association had sent thirteen sets of Japanese working women's clothing and many clothing designs to the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and wrote a letter expressing the hope that they could be provided to relevant departments for reference.

The Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries has now forwarded these clothes to the Central Academy of Fine Arts for reference.
