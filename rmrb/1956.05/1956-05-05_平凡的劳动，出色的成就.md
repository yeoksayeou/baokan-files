　　Ordinary Labor, Extraordinary Achievements
　　——Excerpts from speeches by advanced producers Qi Shuchun and others at the four-day meeting——
    At the four-day meeting of the National Conference of Advanced Producers, eleven representatives spoke, including engineers and military representatives who built the Kangzang Highway, construction workers, textile workers and machine workers, a grazing girl from the Inner Mongolian grassland, bus drivers and conductors, shop assistants and famous chefs. These advanced producers reported to the conference on their vivid deeds on various production and construction fronts, and these speeches constantly won warm applause from the audience.
    Five Years on the "Roof of the World"
    Qi Shuchun, an engineer who participated in the construction of the Kangzang Highway, and Wang Heqing, a military representative, introduced how they overcame various difficulties in the construction of the Kangzang Highway. Qi Shuchun said: The Kangzang Highway is more than 2,000 kilometers long and passes through 14 large mountains, but the survey team traveled more than 20,000 kilometers to find the way and climbed hundreds of mountains. These mountains are so high that you can't see the top when you look up, and the mountainsides are covered in clouds and mist. It's snowy all year round, the air is thin, and people have difficulty breathing when they climb the mountains, and they have to gasp for breath after every step. Many people in our survey team were visiting such places for the first time. Many people had nosebleeds, their faces peeled, and some had bleeding from their eyes and ears. Here, water boils at a few tens of degrees. When we first arrived in the plateau, the cooks had no experience, and we ate raw rice every day. It was very cold here, but the comrades of the survey team had to go to places no matter how cold they were. When they passed the Que'er Mountain, a mouthful of sputum froze into ice flowers before it even hit the ground, and the breath they exhaled turned into frost and stuck to their beards and eyebrows. When the comrades of the survey team arrived at the snowy mountains, they could only set up tents on the snow at night, and the tents were full of snow. At night, they spread their quilts on the snow to sleep. When they got up the next day, some people's hair was frozen to the quilts.
    The comrades of the survey team ran in the deep mountains and forests all year round in order to find the way. Sometimes, they couldn't find any signs of human habitation for hundreds of miles. When there wasn't enough food, they dug up snow pigs to eat and caught fish to eat. When they couldn't pass the cliffs, they used knives to dig footholds. At that time, the people in the team all carried knives and ropes. If they really couldn't go down, they used ropes to lower themselves. The survey team didn't have tape measures, so they used lead wires instead; they didn't have pedometers, so they counted steps, counting how many steps were 100 meters, and putting a small stone in their pocket for every 100 meters. Ten small stones were exchanged for a large stone, counting as 1,000 meters. At night, they counted the stones to know how far the mileage was. We had an engineer named Yu Jiong, who led a survey team from Qamdo to Lhasa, surveying the northern, central, and southern routes. They climbed over seventy-two mountains and traveled tens of thousands of miles. They lost contact for a month in the middle. Everyone thought they had sacrificed, but in the end, they completed their mission and returned. They traveled on the road for more than a year. When they came back, their hair and beards were very long, and their clothes were so tattered that they couldn't cover their bodies. Everyone couldn't recognize them when they met.
    In 1953, when we entered the forest area, our clothes were torn into strips by thorns, so we had to tie them to our legs with ropes, looking like beggars. At that time, Commissar Bei Rang saw it and immediately sent a telegram to Chengdu, and we were transported canvas clothes by plane. This kind of specially made clothes could not be worn out no matter how hard it was. Some people still keep it as a souvenir today. In the summer of 1954, we were surveying in the Bomi area. It rained constantly, and everyone was soaked. When we entered the tent at night, we took off our wet clothes and got into the quilt. The next day, we still put on wet clothes to work. The rain rotted the tent, and a finger could poke a hole in it. It rained outside and leaked inside.
    The Kangzang Highway has been open to traffic for nearly two years, and the lives of the Tibetan people have undergone great changes. I have worked in Kangzang for more than five years. Half of my hair has turned white, and one of my eyes can't see things clearly. But when I left Kangzang, I saw many new buildings along the road, and there were electric lights, farms, and tractors. The Tibetans can also eat salt and wear colorful clothes. I am really happy in my heart. The past suffering has turned into sweetness, and hardship has turned into happiness. I feel that contributing all my strength to the construction of the motherland and working in the most difficult places can bring the greatest happiness and the greatest comfort.
    Grazing Girl
    Hao Erla, a grazing girl from the Huangqi Ranch of the Inner Mongolia Food Company, introduced her experience in raising dairy cows. She said: In 1954, the ranch launched a competition. We guaranteed to milk each cow twice a day, two kilograms each time, and each person averaged 70 kilograms a day. How can we complete it when the cows are so thin and there is so little milk? I began to carefully study the activities of the cows and found that some cows still wanted to eat grass after returning from grazing at night. I thought this must be because they were not full. I suggested to the leader "adding a grazing session at night." It is easy for cows to run away and be harmed by wolves when grazing at night. Four female comrades in the group were afraid. Later, a male comrade and I took turns grazing at night. We call this grazing method the "Xu Hai Grazing Method." After the dairy cows grazed once more every night, each cow produced 1.5 kilograms more milk per day, and each cow increased by 45 kilograms per month, exceeding the competition target. Our group received the red flag. In the second half of 1955, the Party assigned our group the task of raising and grazing a batch of export cattle. How can we make the cattle gain weight to the maximum extent in the shortest time? It is impossible to complete the task without using new methods of grazing. I began to pay attention to research and found that cattle do not like to eat grass when the weather is hot, and the grazing time is short. In addition, the grass quality in the Chahar League area is not good, so the cattle cannot eat enough; it is cool in the morning, and the cattle like to eat grass. So I proposed the "Three-Three-Two Grazing Method," which means grazing three times a day, resting three times between the three grazing sessions, and drinking water once in the morning and afternoon. This method is based on the "Xu Hai Grazing Method." Therefore, the livestock can eat three full meals a day, ensuring weight gain. Later, I found that after the cattle were full, they were always unwilling to walk and could not be driven back, and the pen was far from the grassland. I thought: Isn't it good to let the cattle rest on the spot after they are full? This way, they can eat enough and rest well, and the cattle will definitely gain weight faster. After this experiment, the cattle did gain weight really fast. So this method is called the "Follow-the-Grass-and-Ground Pen Method." Implementing this method, we grazed a total of 1,089 cattle in the third quarter, with an average weight gain of 60 kilograms per cattle, for a total weight gain of more than 65,000 kilograms. We successfully completed the task of raising and grazing export cattle.
    Passing on Advanced Experience to Others
    Lin Ruiting, the leader of the carpentry team of the Second Engineering Company of the Sichuan Provincial Urban Construction Bureau and a special-class labor model in Chengdu, introduced at the conference their experience in how to pass on advanced experience to others. He said that in the past, when I promoted advanced experience, I just talked about it at the meeting and performed it, and that was it. But when the masses encountered specific difficulties, no one was there to help them solve them, and the advanced experience could not be promoted. I thought: If you really want to help others learn advanced experience, you must first be able to get others to accept it. After accepting it, you must help them master it. Finally, you must see how the effect is after promotion. On our construction site, the Tang Yunqing and Xu Shaoqing groups could not meet the quota. The Xu Shaoqing group was making roof trusses, so we went with a few comrades to carefully observe their operating procedures, find out the reasons that affected efficiency, and then personally operate for them to see. This not only helped them reach the quota but also saved more than eighty workdays. Using the same method, we helped the Tang Yunqing group increase work efficiency by more than three times. After we were transferred to the 144 construction site, we found that the efficiency of the Lin Degui group was also very low, only reaching about 85% of the quota. We also studied with the group leader Lin Degui and adopted the method of exchanging workers for study to exchange experience. The three comrades who went from our group helped them improve the labor organization and helped them promote several advanced experiences and tools, so that they quickly went from not being able to meet the quota to exceeding the quota by 70%. The three people who came to our group from their group also quickly became familiar with some of the tools we used, and after returning, they became the backbone of promoting advanced experience in the Lin Degui group. Sometimes a task is very large and requires several groups to work together. We reach an agreement with each group, and after approval from the leadership, we form a larger joint group and assign people from different groups to the same process to work. This makes it easier to exchange experiences with each other. From September last year to February this year, our group, like the one mentioned above, helped eight groups and 104 workers through several forms such as exchanging workers for mutual assistance, individual assistance, and organizing joint groups. They averaged 30% to 70% above the national labor quota.
　　"Old and Young Safe" and "Hundred Birds Facing the Phoenix"
    Xiao Liangchu, a famous chef at the Jinjiang Hotel in Shanghai, introduced at the conference how he made good dishes for consumers. He said: After liberation, with the development of production, people's living standards have also improved. I thought that as a chef, I should make more styles and more delicious dishes to meet the needs of consumers. I saw that some people liked to eat steak in Western food, so I studied it according to the characteristics of steak and made a Chinese steak that was more tender than Western steak. I used chili sauce, tomato sauce, and sugar to make it, so it has a spicy, sour, and sweet taste. Each plate only costs a few cents, which is economical and affordable, and it is very popular. Last year, I also tried to research and develop "Crispy Douchi Chicken." This dish is fried with douchi and fried with crispy flour in oil, so it is fragrant and crispy, and it is very suitable for drinking. I also developed "Brocade Fish Balls" according to the taste of my hometown in Guangdong. This dish can be made with any kind of fish. Because the fish bones are removed when making it, the elderly and children can eat it, especially the elderly without teeth are very welcome, so people call this dish "Old and Young Safe." When we make dishes, we not only pay attention to the quality of the dishes but also pay attention to the appearance of the dishes. For example, in the past, when entertaining guests, watermelons were cut into slices and served. I felt that this was not beautiful, and the taste of the watermelon was also very monotonous. Therefore, according to the method of "Winter Melon Scoop," I made "Watermelon Scoop," which did not cut the watermelon open, but only opened a hole, dug out the watermelon pulp, and then mixed it with sugar, added cherries and pineapples, and at the same time, carved some landscapes and figures on the outside of the watermelon skin with a small knife. Some foreign guests took the empty melon skin back as a souvenir after eating it. When I was abroad, I saw that there were many styles of dishes in the Soviet Union, and they were matched with various colors, which was very beautiful. Absorbing these advantages, I made a dish called "Hundred Birds Facing the Phoenix." After the chicken is cooked, add five spices, then remove the chicken bones, chop them up, and arrange them into a phoenix. Use green vegetables, red carrots, and egg yolks as the tail. Put Anren eggs, Jiao eggs, rice flower sparrows, and Anren sparrows around the chicken. From the side, it looks like "Hundred Birds Facing the Phoenix," which is very beautiful, and the taste is more delicious than before. It is also more convenient to eat without bones.

　　平凡的劳动，出色的成就
　　——先进生产者齐树椿等在四日会议上的发言摘要——
    全国先进生产者代表会议的四日会议上，有十一位代表发言，这些代表中有修筑康藏公路的工程师和部队代表，有建筑工人，纺织女工和机器工人，内蒙古草原上的放牧姑娘，汽车司机和售票员，商店售货员和名厨师等。这些先进生产者分别向大会报告了他（她）们在各个生产建设战线上的生动事迹，这些发言不断地赢得了全场热烈的掌声。
    在“世界屋脊”上五年
    参加修建康藏公路的工程师齐树椿，和部队代表王鹤卿，介绍了他们在修建康藏公路中如何克服种种困难。齐树椿说：康藏公路全长二千多公里，穿过十四座大山，可是踏勘队为了找路，却跑了不止二万多公里，翻了几百座大山。这些山都是抬头看不到顶，山腰上都是云雾。一年四季都是雪，空气稀薄，人爬到山上，呼吸都感到困难，走一步就得喘口气。我们踏勘队里有许多人都是第一次到这样的地方，许多人鼻子里流血，脸上脱皮，有的人眼睛和耳朵都出血。这里，水到几十度就开了，我们才到高原时，炊事员没有经验，我们天天吃生饭。这里天气很冷，可是踏勘队的同志们不管多冷的地方都得去。他们过雀儿山的时候，吐一口痰，还没落到地便冻成了冰花，呼出来的气都变成霜粘在胡子眉毛上。踏勘队的同志们到了雪山上，晚上只能把帐篷搭在雪地上，帐篷里全是雪，晚上就把被子铺在雪上睡觉。第二天爬起来，有的人头发都冻得粘在被子上。
    踏勘队的同志们为了找路，整年在深山野林中跑，有时，几百里碰不到人烟。粮食不够了，便挖雪猪子吃，捉鱼吃。悬崖上走不过去，便用刀子挖个踏脚坑。那时队里的人都带着刀和绳子，实在下不去的地方便用绳子吊下去。踏勘队没有皮尺，便用铅丝代替；没有计步器，便数着步子走，多少步算一百公尺，走一百公尺便向口袋里放一块小石子，十个小石子换一个大石子，算一千公尺，晚上数数石子便知道里程多远。我们有个余炯工程师，带了一个踏勘队从昌都到拉萨，踏勘了北路、中路和南路。翻过了七十二座大山，走了上万里路，当中有一个月失掉了联系，大家都以为他们牺牲了，可是最后他们还是完成任务回来了。他们在路上走了一年多，回来的时候，头发、胡子长得老长，衣服都破烂得遮不住身体，见了面大家都认不出了。
    1953年进入森林区，衣裳被荆棘挂成布条，只好用绳子绑在腿上，像个叫花子。那时被让政委看见了，立刻打电报到成都，用飞机给我们运来了帆布衣服。这种特制的衣服怎样也磨不坏，到今天还有人保留着做纪念。1954年夏天，我们在波密区测量，天不断地下雨，每人都浑身湿透，晚上进了帐篷脱下湿衣服便钻进被子里，第二天还是穿上湿衣服工作。雨下得帐篷也霉烂了，手指一顶就是一个洞，外面下雨里面漏雨。
    康藏公路已经通车近两年了，藏族人民的生活起了很大变化。我在康藏工作了五年多，头发白了一半，眼睛也有一只看不清东西了。可是当我离开康藏的时候，看到沿着公路出现了许多新楼房，也有了电灯，也有了农场和拖拉机。藏民也能吃到盐，穿上花衣服，心里真高兴，过去的苦都变成了甜，艰苦都变成了幸福。我觉得为祖国的建设贡献出一切力量，到最艰苦的地方去工作，就能找到最大的快乐、最大的安慰。
    放牧姑娘
    来自蒙古草原的内蒙古食品公司黄旗牧场放牧女工好尔拉，介绍了她饲养乳牛的经验。她说：1954年牧场开展了竞赛，我们保证每头牛一天挤两次奶，每次挤二斤，每人一天平均挤七十斤。如何完成呢，牛这么瘦，奶又少。我开始细心研究牛的活动，发现有些牛在晚上放牧回来以后还想吃草。我想这一定是没吃饱。我就向领导建议“晚上加一次放牧”。在夜间放牧牛容易跑散和被狼伤害，小组里有四个女同志害怕，后来就由我和一个男同志轮流在夜间放牧。我们把这种放牧叫做“戌亥放牧法”。奶牛经过每天晚上加一次放牧，每头每天多产奶一斤半，每头每月增加四十五斤，超额完成了竞赛指标，我们小组得到了红旗。1955年下半年，党又把一批出口牛的饲养、放牧任务交给我们小组了。怎样才能够使牛在最短的时间内，能最大限度的长膘呢，不用新方法放牧是不能完成任务的。我就开始注意研究，发现牛在天气热的时候不爱吃草，放的时间又短，再加上察哈尔盟地区的草质不好，因此牛吃不饱；早晨凉爽，牛爱吃草。我就提出了“三三二放牧法”，即是一天中放牧三次，在三次放牧之间休息三次，在上午和下午各饮水一次。这个方法是在“戌亥放牧法”的基础上提出来的。因此作到了牲畜一天吃三个饱，使增膘长肉得到了保证。后来我又发现牛吃饱了以后，老是不愿意走，赶不回去，而且打盘的地方又离草地远。我就想：叫牛吃饱了以后就地休息不好吗？这样既吃的饱，休息得又好，牛长膘一定更快。经过这样试验，牛长膘确实快了。就把这个方法叫做“随草随地打盘法”。实行这个方法，在第三季度内我们共放牛1，089头，平均每头牛增膘六十斤，共增膘65，000多斤。胜利地完成了出口牛的饲养、放牧任务。
    把先进经验传授给别人
    四川省城市建设局第二工程公司木工组组长、成都市特等劳动模范林瑞庭，在大会上介绍了他们如何把先进经验传授给别人的经验。他说，过去我推广先进经验，只是在大会上讲一讲，表演一番就算了。可是群众一遇到具体困难，再没有人在现场帮助他解决，先进经验也就推不动了。我想：要是真想帮助别人学习先进经验，那首先就得能让人家接受，接受了以后就要帮助人家掌握起来，最后，还要看一看推广后的效果怎样。我们的工地上，唐云清、徐绍清两个小组都达不到定额。徐绍清小组正作屋架，我们就去了几个同志详细察看他们的操作规程，找出影响效率的原因，然后再亲自操作给他们看。这样不但帮助他们达到了定额，还节省了八十多个工。用同样的办法，帮助唐云清小组把工作效率提高了三倍以上。我们调到一四四工地以后，发现林德贵小组的效率也很低，仅能达到定额的85％左右。我们又和林德贵小组长研究，采取了换工留学的办法来交流经验。我们小组去的三个同志，帮助他们改进了劳动组织，帮助他们推广了几种先进经验和工具，这样他们就很快的从达不到定额，提高到超过定额70％。他们小组来到我们组的三个人，也很快的熟悉了我们所使用的一些工具，回去以后，就成了林德贵小组里推广先进经验的骨干。有时候一项任务很大，需要几个组一齐来作，我们就和各组取得协议，经过领导上批准以后，组成一个较大的联合组，把不同小组的人，配备到同样的工序上去干活。这样就更便于互相交流经验了。我们小组从去年九月，到今年二月，就像上边所讲的那个样子，通过换工互助，个别帮助和组织联合组等几种形式，一共帮助了八个小组，一百零四名工人，他们平均超过国家劳动定额30％到70％。
　　“老少平安”和“百鸟朝凤”
    上海锦江饭店的名厨师萧良初，在大会上介绍了他怎样为消费者烧制出好的菜。他说：解放后，人民随着生产的发展，生活水平也提高了。我想，自己是个厨师，应该做出样式更多、味道更美的菜，来满足消费者的要求。我看到西餐里的牛排有些人很爱吃，我就根据牛排的特点，进行研究，作出了一种比西餐牛排嫩的中餐牛排，我用辣酱油、蕃茄沙士、糖来作，这样就带有辣、酸、甜的滋味，每盘只有几角钱，又经济又实惠，很受人们欢迎。去年我又想法研究出“酥作豉汁鸡”。这种菜因为用豉汁炒的，又用酥皮粉放在油内炸，所以香而酥，非常适合喝酒。我又根据广东家乡口味，研究出“锦绣鱼球”。这种菜不管什么样的鱼都可以做，因为作时先去了鱼骨，老人、小孩都可以吃，特别是没有牙的老年人很欢迎，所以人们叫这样菜为“老少平安”。我们在作菜时，不但注意菜的质量，而且注意菜的美观。例如，过去在招待客人时，西瓜是切好一片片的端上来，我感到这样既不美观，西瓜的味道也很单调。因此，就根据“冬瓜?”的作法，作出了“西瓜?”，把西瓜不切开来，只是开个洞，把西瓜肉挖出来，然后拌上糖，加进樱桃、菠萝，同时在西瓜皮外面用小刀雕刻上一些山水人物。有的外宾吃完后，把空瓜皮带回去留作纪念。我在国外时看到苏联的很多菜，样式很多，并且在菜上配上各种颜色，非常美观。吸收这些优点，我就做出了一种叫“百鸟朝凤”的菜。把鸡一烧熟，加上五香，然后去掉鸡骨，切碎，摆成一个凤凰，用青菜、红萝卜、鸡蛋黄作尾巴，鸡的四周放上安仁蛋、饺蛋、禾花雀、安仁雀，这样从旁一看，活像“百鸟朝凤”，十分美观，同时味道也比过去鲜美。去掉骨头吃起来也更方便。
