Xinhua News Agency, May 20th, Moscow Dispatch: Statement on the talks between Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, N.A. Bulganin, Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, N.S. Khrushchev, and First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR, V.M. Molotov, and Prime Minister of the French Republic, Guy Mollet, and French Foreign Minister, C. Pineau.

Prime Minister of the French Republic, Mr. Mollet, Foreign Minister, Mr. Pineau, and their entourage, visited Moscow from May 15th to 19th, 1956, at the invitation of the Soviet government.

During their stay in Moscow, they held talks with Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Bulganin, Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Khrushchev, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR, Molotov, and other Soviet leaders. Soviet and French advisors and experts also participated in the talks.

The talks were conducted in a friendly and sincere atmosphere and in a spirit of mutual understanding. During the talks, the two sides had a beneficial exchange of views on Franco-Soviet relations and ways to improve them, as well as on overall international issues. This enabled both sides to conduct useful discussions, which showed that the two governments hold consistent views on some issues, while on others, the differences between the two sides could not be reduced. However, the talks at least enabled both sides to better understand each other's positions.

The representatives of the two governments unanimously affirmed that the good relations between the Soviet Union and the French Republic, which are linked by many years of traditional friendship, are constantly developing on the basis of mutual understanding and respect.

The two governments, committed to easing international tensions, recognized that the development and improvement of Franco-Soviet relations in all aspects are not only in the interests of the people of both countries, but also a major contribution to consolidating universal peace and security.

They noted with satisfaction the recent improvement in the international situation. However, the Soviet and French representatives believe that there is still a lack of necessary trust between countries, and therefore they expressed their firm determination to take measures to promote mutual trust and improve relations between countries with different political, economic and social systems. The Soviet and French representatives believe that direct contact between leaders is meaningful in this regard, and they hope that such contact will be developed among national leaders of various countries in the future.

The representatives of the Soviet Union and the French Republic reaffirmed their adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter, the effective application of which will help to resolve outstanding issues one by one.

They reiterated the willingness of the two governments to abide by such provisions of the Charter that stipulate that any disputes should be resolved by peaceful means and that the threat or use of force is prohibited except for self-defense. They expressed their firm belief that mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, and non-interference in internal affairs are the main foundations for peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation among countries.

The exchange of views on European security showed that the two governments share the view that peace and security in Europe are of decisive significance for maintaining universal peace. However, they did not reach agreement on how to solve the European issue.

In order to solve important outstanding issues, the two governments will continue to cooperate in a way that is conducive to consolidating universal peace. They are deeply convinced that as long as they make efforts, and the governments of other countries, inspired by the will for peace, also make efforts, international trust will be established, the Cold War will eventually be eliminated, and the arms race will end, so that the people of all countries will be freed from the threat of a new war.

    Disarmament

The Soviet and French representatives extensively discussed the issue of disarmament during the talks, and both sides believe that the issue of disarmament is an urgent international task under the current circumstances. They are deeply convinced that the resolution of this issue will play a very important role in easing international tensions, strengthening trust, and alleviating the burden of military expenditure.

The Soviet government and the French government will continue to work towards reaching an agreement on disarmament issues within the United Nations organization. Both sides unanimously emphasized that the reduction of nuclear weapons is of utmost importance, and atomic energy should only be used for peaceful needs. This is their common goal, and they will continue to work towards this goal.

The two governments will continue to strive for an agreement on the following: take urgent steps to substantially reduce the armed forces of various countries under appropriate international supervision, and appropriately reduce armaments, first and foremost the armed forces and armaments of the five major powers.

The French government recognizes the significance of the Soviet government's decision to unilaterally reduce its own armed forces and armaments. The French government believes that this decision can make the ongoing talks on disarmament smoother.

    Economic and Technical Assistance to Underdeveloped Countries

The issue of providing economic and technical assistance to underdeveloped countries was also discussed.

The Soviet government and the French government fully agree on the need to work together to provide economic and technical assistance to underdeveloped countries, which will establish closer ties between countries and contribute to easing international tensions.

The basic purpose of assistance should be to enable countries receiving such assistance to move more rapidly along the path of economic and social progress in ways they freely choose. Therefore, they believe that the United Nations can play an unprecedentedly beneficial role in this regard. The Soviet leaders listened to the French government's plans in this regard. They sympathized with the basic proposition of this plan, while reserving their views on the methods of implementing this plan. They believe that the plan presented to them is worthy of careful study. The French government studied the Soviet proposal for the conclusion of a pan-European economic cooperation agreement in the same spirit of understanding.

    Near East and Middle East

In the process of exchanging views, the Soviet and French representatives discussed the situation in the Near East and the Middle East. It was agreed that the situation in the above-mentioned regions should attract the serious attention of the governments of all countries concerned with further easing international tensions and strengthening universal peace.

The French representatives stated that they noted with great interest the views expressed in the Soviet Foreign Ministry's statement of April 17, 1956, regarding the situation in the Near East.

The two governments agreed to give the necessary support to the efforts made by the United Nations to establish peace in the Palestine region and the work done to implement the relevant decisions of the Security Council.

They support the initiatives taken by the United Nations, aimed at ensuring a peaceful resolution of the disputes between Arab countries and Israel on a basis acceptable to all parties concerned.

They support the efforts made by the United Nations to improve the fate of refugees.

    Southeast Asia

The representatives of the two governments discussed the results of the talks in London between the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, and they welcomed the contribution made in this form to the cause of realizing the 1954 agreements and strengthening peace in Southeast Asia.

    Developing Soviet-French Trade Relations

The representatives of the Soviet Union and France also exchanged views on the issue of developing trade between the two countries. The representatives of the two countries agreed to encourage the expansion of the volume of trade between France and the Soviet Union by various means. They believe that this is in line with the economic interests of both parties and is an important factor in the rapprochement and mutual understanding between the two countries.

In order to promote the expansion and stability of trade volume, the representatives of the two governments agreed to conclude a long-term barter agreement, which will stipulate that the supply volume of both parties will increase year by year; France will supply the Soviet Union with machinery and equipment, raw materials and industrial products for various sectors, and the Soviet Union will supply France with the commodities it desires. Moreover, the agreement will stipulate that not only traditional commodities and materials in the trade between the two countries will be supplied, but also other commodities and materials agreed upon by both parties.

The representatives of the two governments also agreed to further study the issue of exchanging consumer goods and promoting contacts between buyers and sellers.

The two sides reached an agreement: in order to conclude the above-mentioned three-year agreement, negotiations will begin in Paris in September 1956, so that the agreement can take effect from January 1, 1957.

The Soviet representatives stated that after trade restrictions are removed and discrimination is eliminated, the Soviet Union may greatly increase the quantity of French goods purchased and the quantity of Soviet goods sold to France during the above-mentioned period, so that by the end of the three-year period, the trade volume between the Soviet Union and France will increase to three to four times the trade volume of 1955.

The representatives of the two governments noted with satisfaction that an agreement has been reached on opening shipping routes between French ports and Soviet ports in the Baltic Sea.

    Soviet and French Cultural Relations

The representatives of the two countries paid special attention to the issue of cultural, scientific, and technological exchanges between France and the Soviet Union. They were pleased to note that they fully agreed on the need to encourage the greatest possible development of such exchanges.

The French government expressed its willingness to contribute to expanding scientific and artistic contacts between the two countries to the Soviet government. It expressed its willingness to invite a group of Soviet engineers and scientists to visit the research center of the French Atomic Energy Commission and to organize performances of the Bolshoi Theater Ballet in Paris.

The Soviet government expressed its willingness to further strengthen cultural ties with France, such as expanding the exchange of books and periodicals.

The two governments agreed to a joint statement attached to this communiqué defining the principles and forms of Franco-Soviet cultural cooperation.

    Other Issues

The representatives of France and the Soviet Union expressed their views on the establishment of various European joint organizations, including organizations for the peaceful use of atomic energy.

The two governments agreed that it is necessary to develop cooperation among countries in the peaceful use of atomic energy, and in particular to promote cooperation in this area within the framework of the United Nations.

The French representatives exchanged views with their Soviet colleagues on the problems they face in Algeria and the policies implemented by the French government in Algeria.

The Soviet representatives expressed the hope that the French government would act in an enlightened spirit, so as to find an appropriate solution to this very important issue that is in line with the spirit of the times and beneficial to the people.

The representatives of the two governments jointly expressed satisfaction with the results of their negotiations, and unanimously agreed that it would be beneficial to resume similar contacts.

    新华社20日讯　塔斯社莫斯科十九日电：关于苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁、苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫和苏联部长会议第一副主席兼苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫同法兰西共和国内阁总理居伊·摩勒和法国外交部长克·比诺会谈的声明。
    法兰西共和国内阁总理摩勒先生、外交部长比诺先生和他们的随行人员，应苏联政府的邀请在1956年5月15日到19日访问了莫斯科。
    在逗留莫斯科期间，他们同苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁、苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫、苏联部长会议第一副主席兼苏联外交部长莫洛托夫以及苏联其他领导人举行了会谈。苏联和法国的顾问和专家也参加了会谈。
    会谈是在友好和恳切坦率的气氛中本着互相谅解的精神进行的。在会谈中，双方就法苏关系和改善双方关系的途径问题以及整个国际问题有益地交换了意见。这使得双方能够进行有益的讨论，讨论表明，两国政府在某些问题上的观点是一致的，而在另一些问题上双方的分歧没有能够减少，然而会谈至少使得双方得以更好地了解彼此的立场。
    两国政府的代表一致认定，有着多年传统友谊联系的苏联和法兰西共和国之间的良好关系，正在互相谅解和尊重的基础上不断发展。
    致力于缓和国际紧张局势的两国政府承认，法苏两国在各方面的关系的发展和改善既符合两国人民的利益，同时也是对巩固普遍和平和安全的一个重大贡献。
    它们满意地指出，最近国际局势有了好转。然而，苏联和法国的代表认为，现在各国之间还缺乏必要的信任，因而他们表示坚决要采取措施，以争取促进互相信任，改善政治、经济和社会制度不同的国家之间的关系。苏联和法国代表认为，领导人的直接接触在这方面是有意义的，他们希望，这种接触今后将在各国的国家领导人之间得到发展。
    苏联和法兰西共和国的代表重申他们遵循联合国宪章的原则，这些原则的有效的运用，将有助于逐一解决悬而未决的问题。
    他们重申，两国政府愿意遵守宪章中这样一些条款，这些条款规定，应该用和平方法解决任何分歧，并且除了自卫以外，禁止武力威胁或使用武力。他们表示坚信，互相尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政是各国之间和平共处和友好合作的主要的基础。
    就欧洲安全问题交换意见的结果表明，两国政府在欧洲的和平和安全对维护普遍和平有决定意义这一点上有共同的看法。不过，它们没有在解决欧洲问题的方法方面达成协议。
    为了解决悬而未决的重要问题，两国政府将继续进行有利于巩固普遍和平的合作。它们深信，只要它们作出努力，受和平意志所鼓舞的其他国家的政府也作出努力，国际信任就会建立起来，冷战终会消除，军备竞赛将会结束，从而各国人民将会摆脱新战争的威胁。
    裁军问题
    苏联和法国的代表在会谈中广泛地讨论了裁军问题，双方认为，在目前情况下，裁军问题是迫切的国际任务。他们深信，这个问题的解决将会对缓和国际紧张局势、对加强信任、对减轻军事开支的负担起非常重要的作用。
    苏联政府和法国政府将继续努力，以争取在联合国组织中达成关于裁军问题的协议。双方一致强调，裁减核子武器有着极其重要的意义，原子能应该只用于和平的需要。这是他们共同的目的，他们将为达到这个目的而继续努力。
    双方政府将继续努力争取达成下列协议：采取紧急步骤以便在适当的国际监督之下大大裁减各国的武装部队，并且适当地裁减军备，首先是裁减五大国的武装部队和军备。
    法国政府承认苏联政府所采取的关于单方面裁减自己的武装部队和军备的决定的意义。法国政府觉得，这个决定能够使正在进行的关于裁军的会谈更加顺利。
    对不发达的国家的经济和技术援助
    还讨论了对不发达的国家提供经济和技术援助的问题。
    苏联政府和法国政府完全同意，有必要共同努力对不发达的国家提供经济和技术援助，这样就能够在各国之间建立起更紧密的联系，而且这也是对缓和国际紧张局势的一种贡献。
    援助的基本目的应当是，使接受这种援助的国家用它们自己自由选择的方法更迅速地沿着经济和社会进步的道路前进。因此，它们认为，联合国能够在这方面空前地起有益的作用。苏联领导人听取了法国政府关于这方面的计划。他们同情这项计划的基本主张，同时对于实施这个计划的方法保留自己的观点。他们认为，这个向他们提出来的计划值得仔细研究。法国政府以同样谅解的精神研究了苏联提出的关于缔结全欧经济合作协定的建议。
    近东和中东
    苏联和法国代表在交换意见的过程中，讨论了近东和中东的局势。大家认为，上述地区的局势应该引起一切关心进一步缓和国际紧张局势和加强普遍和平的国家的政府的严重注意。
    法国代表表示，他们很有兴趣地注意到了苏联外交部1956年4月17日关于近东局势的声明中的看法。
    两国政府同意，给予联合国为确立巴勒斯坦地区的和平所作的努力和执行安全理事会的相应决定所做的工作以必要的支持。
    它们支持联合国所采取的、以保证在各有关国家可以接受的基础上和平解决阿拉伯国家同以色列之间的争执问题为目的的倡议。
    他们支持联合国为改善避难者的命运所作的努力。
    东南亚
    两国政府的代表讨论了日内瓦会议的两位主席在伦敦会谈的结果，他们欢迎以这种形式为实现1954年的协定、加强东南亚和平的事业所带来的贡献。
    发展苏法贸易关系
    苏法两国的代表还就发展两国贸易的问题交换了意见。两国代表同意用种种方法来鼓励扩大法苏两国的贸易额，他们认为，这符合双方的经济利益，并且是两国接近和互相谅解的重要因素。
    为了促进贸易额的扩大和稳定，两国政府代表同意缔结长期换货协定，这个协定将规定双方供货量一年比一年增加；法国供给苏联各部门用的机器和设备、原料和工业品，苏联将供给法国所希望要的商品。而且，协定将规定不仅供给两国贸易中传统的商品和物资，而且也供给双方商定的其他商品和物资。
    两国政府代表也同意进一步研究交换消费品的问题和促进卖买双方的接触的问题。
    双方达成协议：为了缔结上述的为期三年的协定、将在1956年9月在巴黎开始谈判，以便使这个协定能够从1957年1月1日起生效。
    苏联代表表示，在贸易上不加限制和取消歧视以后，苏联可能在上述的时期内大大增加购买法国的货物的数量和把苏联的货物出售给法国的数量，使得在三年的时期结束的时候，苏联和法国之间的贸易额将增加到1955年的贸易额的三倍到四倍。
    两国政府的代表满意地指出，双方已经就在法国港口和波罗的海的苏联港口之间开辟航线的问题达成协议。
    苏联和法国的文化关系
    两国代表特别注意到法国和苏联之间的文化、科学和技术交流的问题。他们愉快地指出，他们完全同意有必要鼓励这种交流的尽量的发展。
    法国政府向苏联政府表示愿意对扩大两国的科学和艺术方面的接触作出贡献。它表示愿意邀请一批苏联工程师和科学家访问法国原子能委员会的研究中心，并且在巴黎组织莫斯科大剧院巴蕾舞团的演出。
    苏联政府方面表示愿意进一步加强同法国的文化联系，例如扩大书籍和期刊的交换。
    两国政府同意了附在本公报上的确定法苏文化合作的原则和形式的联合声明。
    其他问题
    法国和苏联的代表对建立各种欧洲联合组织，其中包括和平利用原子能的组织的问题，表示了自己的看法。
    两国政府同意，必须发展各国在和平利用原子能方面的合作，特别是促进在联合国范围内实行这一方面的合作。
    法国代表同他们的苏联同事们就他们在阿尔及利亚所面临的问题和法国政府在阿尔及利亚所实行的政策交换了意见。
    苏联代表表示希望法国政府以开明的精神行动，从而能够为这一个非常重要的问题找出符合时代精神和有利于人民的适当解决。
    两国政府代表对他们的谈判结果共同表示满意，并且一致认为恢复类似的接触是有好处的。
