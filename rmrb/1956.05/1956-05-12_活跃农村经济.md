    Revitalizing the Rural Economy
    Wang Changlong
    Recently, an abnormal phenomenon has occurred in Henan Province: many members of agricultural production cooperatives are complaining about "not having pocket money." The rural market is showing signs of inactivity. The province's commodity purchase and sales plan, transportation plan, and fiscal revenue plan for the first quarter have not been completed.
    The main reasons why farmers feel they "don't have pocket money" are: first, agricultural production cooperatives have focused on agricultural production and relaxed sideline production, and have not made reasonable arrangements for agricultural and sideline production, resulting in a significant reduction in farmers' sideline income. Second, some agricultural cooperatives blindly raised production increase targets and mobilized members to invest too much. Third, agricultural cooperatives demanded cultural and welfare undertakings and long-term benefit-yielding capital construction on too large a scale and too quickly, spending too much material and financial resources. In addition, some agricultural cooperative staff adopted coercive methods in mobilizing farmers to invest in the cooperative, making wealthy people afraid of "revealing their wealth," so they were afraid to spend money even if they had it. All of this has created the current phenomenon of financial tightness in rural areas.
    Is it true that farmers generally have no money at present? The actual situation is not like this. In Henan Province, the currency issuance in the first quarter was greater than the withdrawal. The agricultural loan target for the first quarter in the province was 69.18 million yuan, the state put in 31.25 million yuan of advance purchase deposits for agricultural products, and 55.66 million yuan was put in for purchasing local specialties and waste products, totaling 156.09 million yuan. The agricultural loan target for the second quarter is 64.39 million yuan, the disaster relief fund is 2 million yuan, the advance purchase deposit for agricultural products is 16.59 million yuan, and the purchase amount of local specialties and waste products is 47.43 million yuan, totaling 130.41 million yuan. However, the amount of currency recovered by the state is not as much as the amount issued. This shows that farmers have a considerable amount of money in their hands.
    This situation shows that the current financial tightness in rural areas has a certain degree of falsehood.
    In response to this problem in rural economic life, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Henan Provincial People's Committee issued an emergency instruction on implementing the policy of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, revitalizing the rural economy, and ensuring increased agricultural production. The instruction emphasized that if the abnormal phenomenon in the current rural economy cannot be quickly, practically, and effectively overcome, it will inevitably affect spring plowing and this year's agricultural production increase, and affect the consolidation of agricultural production cooperatives. Therefore, the instruction requires party committees and people's committees at all levels, and all rural workers, to earnestly and responsibly solve this problem within a short period of time. In order to revitalize the rural economy, the instruction also requires leading organs at all levels to criticize the bad tendencies of cadres who do not care about the people's hardships, do not consult with the masses on everything, and use coercion and commandism, to publicize the principle of running cooperatives diligently and thriftily to the masses, eliminate the various concerns of the masses, and prevent farmers' enthusiasm for production from being dampened. At the same time, leading organs at all levels are required to carefully study the new situation of the rural economy after agricultural cooperation, so that agricultural production cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, credit cooperatives, and handicraft production cooperatives can support each other, coordinate their actions, and jointly improve production. Government financial departments should vigorously support agricultural production cooperatives and take effective measures to help them overcome their economic difficulties.

    活跃农村经济
    王昌隆
    近来，河南省发生了一种不正常的现象：很多农业生产合作社的社员叫喊“没零花钱”。农村市场呈现不活跃的状况。第一季度全省商品购销计划、交通运输计划和财政税收计划都没有完成。
    农民所以感到“没零花钱”，主要是因为：一、农业生产合作社抓住了农业生产，放松了副业生产，对农、副生产没有进行合理安排，农民的副业收入大大减少。二、有些农业合作社盲目提高增产指标，发动社员投资过多。三、农业合作社对文化福利事业和长期才能得到收益的基本建设要求的规模过大过急，花费的物力、财力太多。此外，有些农业合作社的工作人员在发动农民向社投资的过程中，采用了强迫命令的办法，使有钱的人怕“露富”，有钱也不敢用。所有这些，就造成了目前农村金融紧张的现象。
    目前农民是不是真正普遍没有钱呢？实际情况并不是这样。河南省第一季度的货币投放是大于回笼的。第一季度全省农贷指标是6，918万元，国家投放的农产品预购定金是3，125万元，收购土特产品和废品投放了5，566万元，这三项共计15，609万元。第二季度的农贷指标是6，439万元，救灾款是200万元，农产品预购定金是1，659万元，土特产和废品收购额是4，743万元，这几项合计为13，041万元。但是，国家收回的货币并没有投放的多。这就说明农民手里是有相当一部分钱的。
    这个情况说明，目前的农村金融紧张，是带有一定的虚假性的。
    中共河南省委、河南省人民委员会针对农村经济生活中这个问题，发出了关于贯彻执行勤俭办社方针、活跃农村经济保证农业增产的紧急指示。指示中强调指出：目前农村经济中的不正常现象，如果不能迅速地切实有效地加以克服，势必影响春耕生产和今年的农业增产，影响到农业生产合作社的巩固。因之，指示要求各级党委和人民委员会、全体农村工作人员，在短期间内认真负责地解决这个问题。为了使农村经济活跃起来，指示还要求各地领导机关要批判干部中存在的那种不关心群众疾苦、遇事不和群众商量、强迫命令等不良倾向，向群众宣传勤俭办社的道理，消除群众的各种顾虑，使农民的生产积极性不受挫伤。同时，要求各级领导机关认真研究农村合作化以后农村经济的新情况，使农业生产合作社、供销合作社、信用合作社、手工业生产合作社互相支援，协同动作，共同把生产搞好。政府财经部门要大力支持农业生产合作社，采取有效办法帮助它们克服经济上的困难。
