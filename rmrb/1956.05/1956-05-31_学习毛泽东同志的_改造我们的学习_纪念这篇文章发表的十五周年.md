    Learning from Comrade Mao Zedong's "Reform Our Study"
    —Commemorating the Fifteenth Anniversary of the Publication of This Article
    Yin Jia
    Comrade Mao Zedong's "Reform Our Study" was published in May 1941, the fourth year of the Anti-Japanese War. This was written by Comrade Mao Zedong to defend the Marxist-Leninist theoretical foundation of our Party, and it is an outstanding fighting document. This article exposed the subjective dogmatic style of thinking that was widely present in the revolutionary ranks at that time, and made a profound analysis of the various errors of this style of thinking in its attitude towards the status quo, history, and Marxism-Leninism; pointing out that this style of thinking is a great enemy of the proletariat, an enemy of the people, and a manifestation of impure Party spirit. Comrade Mao Zedong called on the entire Party to launch a rectification movement to combat dogmatism, and called on all Party cadres to reform their thinking and style of work in accordance with the ideological principles of Marxism-Leninism.
    The rectification movement during the Anti-Japanese War was a Marxist-Leninist movement of great historical significance. This movement swept away the adverse effects of dogmatism in the Chinese revolution since 1931. During the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the "Left" leaning line of dogmatism had dominated the central organs of the Chinese Communist Party. As Comrade Mao Zedong described, these dogmatists "thought they were always right, acted like 'His Majesty I,' and sent 'imperial envoys' flying everywhere," "issuing orders based solely on a smattering of knowledge or on 'wishful thinking.'" Dogmatism caused extremely painful losses to the Chinese revolution, causing the revolutionary base areas to lose 90% of their strength and the revolutionary forces in the Kuomintang-controlled areas to lose almost 100%, which means that the Chinese revolution almost suffered a complete defeat. The rule of dogmatism basically ended in January 1935, but its adverse effects persisted widely within the revolutionary ranks for a long time. In response to this situation, Comrade Mao Zedong believed that in order to effectively overcome and avoid various political and organizational errors within the Party, it was first necessary to launch a struggle of proletarian ideology against non-proletarian ideology, and it was first necessary to smash this anti-Marxist-Leninist dogmatism on the ideological front.
    The rectification movement during the Anti-Japanese War was a great ideological revolution within the Party. "Reform Our Study" was the first article by Comrade Mao Zedong calling for the launch of the rectification movement, and it is one of Comrade Mao Zedong's basic works on the rectification movement.
    In "Reform Our Study," Comrade Mao Zedong closely linked overcoming the dogmatic style of thinking with developing the Marxist-Leninist style of thinking. On the one hand, he vigorously opposed the erroneous tendencies of dogmatism in dealing with theory and practice, and on the other hand, he vigorously promoted the correct attitude of Marxism-Leninism in dealing with theory and practice.
    The basic characteristic of dogmatism is the separation of theory and practice, while the basic principle of Marxism-Leninism is the unity of theory and practice. Denying the unity of theory and practice is denying the theoretical foundation of Marxism-Leninism. Whether or not the principle of the unity of theory and practice is observed in practice (rather than just in words) is the fundamental difference between true and false Marxists. In "Reform Our Study," Comrade Mao Zedong focused on expounding the principle of the unity of theory and practice in Marxism-Leninism, and made a scientific analysis of dogmatism from the basic issue of the relationship between theory and practice; this most accurately hit the crux of dogmatism and most thoroughly exposed the ideological basis of dogmatism.
    The unity of theory and practice means that theory originates from practice, is a correct and true reflection of social life and revolutionary struggle, and serves the needs of practice. Scientific theory is a scientific summary of historical and revolutionary practice, and at the same time, it must constantly improve and enrich itself based on practice and research into new problems that arise in real life and revolutionary practice. Therefore, theory is by no means a dogma, nor is it a product of mechanically copying books that is divorced from reality. In the words of Comrade Mao Zedong: "There is only one kind of true theory in the world, and that is the theory drawn from objective reality and verified in objective reality."
    Comrade Mao Zedong called the attitude of unifying theory and practice a scientific attitude, a "purposeful attitude," and a "truth-seeking attitude." According to this attitude, one can correctly treat theory and correctly treat practice; one can make our understanding truly reflect the things that happen in real life, and not lag behind life or practice. The anti-scientific dogmatic attitude is exactly the opposite of these. Dogmatists separate scientific theory from the ever-evolving reality, and do not use Marxism-Leninism as an "arrow" to shoot at the "target" of the Chinese revolution. As Comrade Mao Zedong described, the result is either becoming reckless and ignorant people who "shoot aimlessly and wildly" or becoming antique connoisseurs who "keep saying, 'What a good arrow! What a good arrow!' but are always unwilling to shoot it out."
    In "Reform Our Study," Comrade Mao Zedong profoundly discussed a key issue in achieving the unity of theory and practice, that is, starting from reality.
    Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Marxism-Leninism is science, and science is honest learning, and any little bit of mischief is not allowed." Marxism-Leninism is a science not only because it is the most correct and most revolutionary truth that originates from objective reality and is verified in objective reality, but also because it can guide us to understand the original appearance of objective things, and it is a guide to action. To understand the original appearance of things is to understand the laws of motion of things themselves and the diverse relationships of things with other things. The only way to understand the original appearance of things, of course, can only be to rely on conducting investigations and research, relying on mastering rich materials, and relying on conducting scientific analysis of objective things. Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly explained the importance of studying facts and called on us to observe problems starting from reality. He wanted us to carry out our work in this way: "Not based on subjective imagination, not based on momentary enthusiasm, not based on dead books, but based on objectively existing facts, possessing detailed materials, and under the guidance of the general principles of Marxism-Leninism, drawing correct conclusions from these materials."
    Dogmatists directly violate this truth. They never do systematic and thorough investigations and research or conscientious collection of materials on objective reality, and they are never willing to put in hard work or even a little effort in the study of actual things. As a result, objective reality becomes a complete darkness in their minds. Due to the lack of research on facts, dogmatists have subjective and one-sided views in observing problems. They can only talk bombastically without getting to the point, and they are useless in the face of reality.
    The subjectivity and one-sidedness of dogmatism are also manifested in the erroneous treatment of theory. Erroneously treating theory and erroneously treating practice are two inseparable aspects of the same thing. Marxism-Leninism tells us that facts and practice are and always will be the criteria of truth. A scientific attitude should be not to worship idols, not to be afraid of overturning things that do not conform to reality, to be good at independent thinking based on facts, and to work under the guidance of the general principles of Marxism-Leninism but not to be bound by individual principles.
    Dogmatists observe problems starting from books, always using the recitation of words from Marxist works to replace independent thinking starting from facts. They regard Marxism as an immutable dogma and obliterate its living content. As a result, theory becomes a lifeless and useless thing in their hands.
    Achieving the unity of theory and practice is not an easy task. It requires proficiency in Marxism-Leninism, in-depth study of facts, independent thinking, and creative hard work. The unity of theory and practice is a cause that requires lifelong struggle for us. Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly called dogmatists ideological lazybones, precisely because they are unwilling to study facts, unwilling to correctly use their own thinking organs, and adopt a lazy and opportunistic attitude towards theory and practice.
    It has been fifteen years since the publication of "Reform Our Study." Over the past ten years, through the great work carried out by the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the great cause of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution has taken a big leap forward. Our Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have brilliantly solved the various basic theoretical problems raised in revolutionary practice, thereby leading revolutionary practice to advance victoriously. The rectification movement during the Anti-Japanese War profoundly changed the face of our Party, greatly raising the Marxist-Leninist awareness of our leading organs and many cadres. All of these constitute an important and decisive factor in the continuous victory of the Chinese revolution.
    Over the past ten years, we have achieved many successes in all aspects of our work, and we have also done a lot of beneficial work on the theoretical front. However, it is undeniable that our theoretical work is still far behind the achievements of our practical work. In "Reform Our Study," Comrade Mao Zedong called on us to use the attitude of uniting theory and practice to study the status quo, study history, and learn from international revolutionary experience and Marxism-Leninism. Obviously, we have not implemented Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions well enough. As far as our theoretical work departments and political and economic work departments are concerned, we have not yet realized the requirement put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong: that theory should not lag behind practice. Our people are carrying out a vigorous socialist transformation and socialist construction, have accumulated rich experience, and are facing many complex problems, but in the most important aspect of studying objective reality, our theoretical work has achieved very little. China's role in international life is becoming increasingly important, but our scientific research on world economic, political, and other international issues has hardly begun. Although the research on China's history, especially modern history, has begun, the efforts we have made and the achievements we have obtained are far from sufficient to meet the needs. In learning from Marxism-Leninism and international revolutionary experience, the dogmatic habits of mechanically copying books, mechanically copying foreign experiences, and completely running counter to the scientific style are still tightly binding the minds of many of us.
    The article "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat," written by the People's Daily Editorial Department based on the discussion of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, once stated: "Dogmatism is only something that ideological lazybones will appreciate, and it is harmful and useless to the revolution, to the people, and to Marxism-Leninism. From the perspective of raising the people's consciousness, inspiring the people's vigorous pioneering spirit, and promoting the rapid development of practical work and theoretical work, it is still necessary to break the superstition of dogmatism."
    Comrade Mao Zedong's "Reform Our Study" is a powerful weapon for "breaking the superstition of dogmatism." We should draw wisdom from this outstanding work: learn from it how and in what aspects past dogmatists fell into error, and no longer repeat their mistakes in practice; learn from it the scientific attitude of Marxism-Leninism, and improve our work and study according to this attitude.

    学习毛泽东同志的“改造我们的学习”
    ——纪念这篇文章发表的十五周年
    殷嘉
    毛泽东同志的“改造我们的学习”发表于抗日时期的第四年，即1941年5月。这是毛泽东同志为着保卫我们党的马克思列宁主义的理论基础而写作的，这是一篇杰出的战斗文献。这篇文章揭露了当时广泛地存在于革命队伍中的主观主义的教条主义思想作风，对于这种思想作风表现在对待现状、对待历史和对待马克思列宁主义上的各种错误，作了深刻的分析；指出这种思想作风是无产阶级的大敌，是人民的大敌，是党性不纯的表现。毛泽东同志号召全党开展向教条主义进行战斗的整风运动，号召全党干部按照马克思列宁主义的思想原则改造思想作风。
    抗日时期的整风运动是一个具有伟大历史意义的马克思列宁主义运动。这个运动扫荡了从1931年以来教条主义在中国革命中的恶劣影响。在第二次国内革命战争时期，教条主义的“左”倾路线曾经在中国共产党的中央机关内占了统治地位，正如毛泽东同志所描写的，这些教条主义者“自以为是，老子天下第一，‘钦差大臣’满天飞”，“仅仅根据一知半解，根据‘想当然’，就在那里发号施令”。教条主义给中国革命造成了极可痛心的损失，使得革命根据地的力量丧失了90％，使得国民党统治地区的革命力量差不多丧失了百分之百，就是说几乎使得中国革命遭到全军复没。教条主义的统治在1935年1月便基本上结束了，但是它所造成的恶劣影响却在革命队伍内部长期地广泛地存在着。针对这种情况，毛泽东同志认为要在党内有效地克服和避免政治上、组织上的各种错误，就必须首先展开无产阶级思想对非无产阶级思想的斗争，就必须首先在思想战线上粉碎这种反马克思列宁主义的教条主义。
    抗日时期的整风运动是党内一次伟大的思想革命。“改造我们的学习”就是毛泽东同志号召开展整风运动的第一篇文章，这是毛泽东同志关于整风运动的基本著作之一。
    在“改造我们的学习”里，毛泽东同志把克服教条主义的思想作风同发展马克思列宁主义的思想作风紧密地联系起来，一方面大力地反对了在对待理论和对待实际上的教条主义的错误倾向，另一方面又大力地宣传了马克思列宁主义的对待理论和对待实际的正确态度。
    教条主义的基本特征是理论和实际分离，而马克思列宁主义的基本原则却是理论和实际统一。否认了理论和实际的统一就是否认了马克思列宁主义的理论基础。是否在实际上（而不是只在口头上）遵守理论和实际统一的原则，这是真的和假的马克思主义者的根本区别。毛泽东同志在“改造我们的学习”里，集中地论证了马克思列宁主义的理论和实际统一的原则，从理论和实际的关系这个基本的问题上对于教条主义作了科学的分析；这样就最准确地击中了教条主义的要害，最彻底地揭穿了教条主义的思想基础。
    理论和实际的统一，这就是说，理论从实际产生，是社会生活和革命斗争的正确的真实的反映，是服务于实际的需要的。科学的理论是历史实际和革命实际的科学总结，同时它又必须根据实际，根据对于现实生活中、革命实践中所发生的新的问题进行研究，不断地改善自己，丰富自己。因此，理论决不是教条，决不是脱离实际的搬弄书本的产物。按照毛泽东同志的说法，就是：“真正的理论在世界上只有一种，就是从客观实际抽出来又在客观实际中得到了证明的理论。”
    毛泽东同志把理论和实际统一的态度称为科学的态度，称为“有的放矢的态度”、“实事求是的态度”。按照这种态度，就能正确地对待理论和正确地对待实际；就能使我们的认识真实地反映现实生活中所发生的事物，不会比生活落后，比实践落后。反科学的教条主义的态度和这些恰好相反。教条主义者把科学的理论和经常在推陈出新的实际隔离开来，不以马克思列宁主义这个“矢”去射中国革命这个“的”，正如毛泽东同志所描写过的，结果就成为“无的放矢”、“乱放一通”的鲁莽无知的人，或者成为“连声赞曰：‘好箭！好箭！’却老是不愿意放出去”的古董鉴赏家。
    在“改造我们的学习”里，毛泽东同志深刻地论述了达到理论和实际统一的一个关键问题，即是从实际出发的问题。
    毛泽东同志这样指出：“马克思列宁主义是科学，科学是老老实实的学问，任何一点调皮都是不行的。”马克思列宁主义之所以是科学，不但因为它是从客观实际产生的又在客观实际中获得了证明的最正确最革命的真理，而且因为它能指导我们去认识客观事物的本来面目，它是行动的指南。认识事物的本来面目，也就是认识事物本身的运动的规律，事物同其他事物的多种多样的关系。要认识事物的本来面目，唯一的道路，当然只能是依靠进行调查研究，依靠掌握丰富的材料，依靠对于客观事物进行科学的分析。毛泽东同志反复地说明了研究事实的重要，号召我们观察问题要从实际出发，他要我们这样来进行工作：“不凭主观想像，不凭一时的热情，不凭死的书本，而凭客观存在的事实，详细地占有材料，在马克思列宁主义一般原理的指导下，从这些材料中引出正确的结论。”
    教条主义者直接违反了这个真理，他们对于客观实际从来不做系统周密的调查研究和认真地收集材料的工作，从来不愿意在实际事物的研究上下一番苦功甚至稍为下点功夫，结果客观实际在他们的心目中成为漆黑一团。由于缺乏对实事的研究，就造成了教条主义者在观察问题上的主观性和片面性，他们只能不着边际地夸夸其谈，而在实际面前一无是处。
    教条主义的主观性和片面性还表现在错误地对待理论上。错误地对待理论和错误地对待实际是一件事情的不可分开的两个方面。马克思列宁主义告诉我们，事实、实践是而且永远是真理的标准。科学的态度应当是不崇拜偶像，不怕推翻不合实际的东西，善于根据事实进行独立的思考，在马克思列宁主义一般原理的指导下进行工作但不拘泥于个别的原理原则。
    教条主义者观察问题是从书本出发，总是用背诵马克思主义著作上的词句来代替从事实出发的独立思考，他们把马克思主义看做万古不变的教条而抹杀了它的活的内容，结果理论在他们的手里，成为死气沉沉的无用的东西。
    要达到理论和实际统一，这并不是一件轻而易举的事情，这需要精通马克思列宁主义，需要深入研究事实，需要进行独立思考，需要创造性的辛勤的劳动。理论和实际的统一，对于我们来说，这是需要终身奋斗的事业。毛泽东同志曾经几次地把教条主义者称为思想上的懒汉，正是因为他们不愿意研究事实，不愿意正确地使用自己的思想器官，而对于理论和实际采取偷懒取巧的态度。
    “改造我们的学习”的发表离开现在已经十五年。十多年来，经过以毛泽东同志为首的党的中央所进行的巨大工作，马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践互相结合的伟大事业大大地向前跨进了一步。我们党的中央和毛泽东同志光辉地解决了革命实践中所提出来的各个基本的理论问题，因而领导了革命实践胜利前进。抗日时期的整风运动深刻地改变了我们党的面貌，它使我们的领导机关和许多干部大大地提高了马克思列宁主义的觉悟。所有这些，构成了中国革命不断地赢得胜利的一个重要的而且具有决定意义的因素。
    十多年来，我们在各个方面的工作都取得了很多成绩，我们在理论战线上也做了许多有益的工作。但是，不可否认的，我们的理论工作比之实际工作的成绩还落后了很多。毛泽东同志在“改造我们的学习”里号召我们用理论和实际统一的态度研究现状、研究历史、以及学习国际的革命经验和学习马克思列宁主义。显而易见，对于毛泽东同志的这些指示，我们还是执行得很不够的。就我们的理论工作部门和政治、经济工作部门来说，我们至今还没有实现毛泽东同志所提出的要求：理论不落后于实际。我国人民正在进行着轰轰烈烈的社会主义改造和社会主义建设，已经积累了丰富的经验，并且面对着许多复杂的问题，但是在对于客观实际的研究这个最重要的方面，我们理论工作的成绩还是很少很少的。我国在国际生活中的作用正在愈来愈重要，但是我们对于世界经济、政治和其他国际问题的科学研究却几乎还没有开始。对于我国的历史特别是近代史的研究，虽然已经开始，但是我们所作的努力和所得的成就也还远远不足以适应需要。在学习马克思列宁主义和国际革命经验上，那种死啃书本的、硬搬外国经验的、同科学作风完全背道而驰的教条主义的习气，还紧紧地束缚着我们许多人的头脑。
    人民日报编辑部根据中共中央政治局的讨论所写的“关于无产阶级专政的历史经验”一文曾经这样提出：“教条主义只是思想懒汉才会加以欣赏的东西，它对于革命，对于人民，对于马克思列宁主义，都是有百害而无一利的。从提高人民群众的自觉、鼓舞人民群众的生气勃勃的首创精神、促进实际工作和理论工作的迅速发展等等方面说来，破除教条主义的迷信，现在仍然是必要的。”
    毛泽东同志的“改造我们的学习”就是“破除教条主义的迷信”的一个有力的武器。我们应当从这个杰出的著作中吸取智慧：从它了解过去的教条主义者是怎样和在哪些方面陷入了错误，而在实践中不再重蹈他们的复辙；从它学习马克思列宁主义的科学态度，并且按照这种态度来改进我们的工作和学习。
