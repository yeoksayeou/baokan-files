How to Conduct Wheat Pre-Distribution
Zhang Yumei, Secretary of the Xingtai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Hebei Province

This year's wheat distribution is a new task for Xingtai County after the complete socialist collectivization of agriculture, and cadres at all levels lack experience. In order to do this work well, the Xingtai County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party selected capable cadres to form five working groups. From April 26th, they conducted pilot wheat pre-distribution work in five representative agricultural production cooperatives in the county: Zhehu, Dongchuankou, Nanwangduan, Xiaozicun, and Qianluzi, to gain experience.

These five cooperatives include large cooperatives, small cooperatives, expanded cooperatives, and merged cooperatives, totaling 1,389 households, cultivating 16,372 mu of irrigated and dry land. This year, wheat planting accounted for 40.4% of the cultivated land. The total wheat production is estimated to be 1,189,303 jin, an increase of 29.4% in yield per mu compared to 1955. The trial calculation of pre-distribution results shows that over 92% of cooperative members in the five cooperatives will receive more than in 1955.

The wheat pre-distribution work is carried out in accordance with the principle of "to each according to his work, more work more gain" and the spirit of actively increasing the collective property of the cooperative while ensuring that more than 90% of the members increase their actual income.

Accurate Yield Assessment is Essential

Correctly assessing wheat yield is an important condition for doing a good job in wheat pre-distribution. In order to prevent excessively high or low estimates, the following methods were adopted by the cooperatives in yield assessment: 1. Surveying and assessing each plot individually. For example, in the Xiaozicun cooperative, all those responsible for yield assessment first went to the fields for collective observation to understand the harvest situation, then divided into groups to survey and assess each plot individually. This method is relatively detailed and accurate, but it requires more running around and lost work time. If there is too much wheat land, it is difficult to cover it all. 2. First analyzing the different soil qualities of irrigated and dry land, dividing them into several economic zones according to soil quality, and then dividing each zone into upper, middle, and lower grades. The yield assessment team conducted on-site inspections in each economic zone, found representative plots, and assessed their yields; then they classified and ranked them, and so on, to assess the wheat yield of the entire cooperative. After the yield was approved by the members and became a resolution, it was reduced by 5%-10% as a reserve. This method is better.

Appropriately Handle Non-Production Labor

Controlling capital construction labor and reducing non-production labor in the process of clearing work points and settling accounts is a link to ensure increased actual income for cooperative members. The results of clearing work points and settling accounts in these five cooperatives are: as of the time of formulating the pre-distribution plan, a total of 135,476 work points were invested, of which agricultural and sideline production labor accounted for 73.58%, capital construction labor accounted for 21.52%, and non-production labor accounted for 4.9%. From this result, the amount of capital construction labor and non-production labor is obviously too large. If all of it is counted as labor days for distribution, it will inevitably reduce the value of labor days. If it is not included in the distribution at all, it will create difficulties for future capital construction and cooperative affairs work. Therefore, this part of the labor must be handled properly. The methods of handling adopted by these five cooperatives are summarized as follows:

Handling of Capital Construction Labor: Those that can generate benefits in the current year, or those that do not generate benefits in the current year but require less labor, such as accumulating fertilizer, digging wells, repairing land, shoveling edges, and restoring embankments, are generally stipulated to participate in the current year's distribution. For those with very small benefits in the current year or no benefits in the current year but with large projects and a lot of labor, the method of paying remuneration annually according to the time of benefit is generally adopted. For example, the Qianluzi cooperative built 20 chicken coops, 3 pigsties, reclaimed wasteland, changed roads, and built 26 livestock sheds, totaling 2,792 work points, and it was decided to pay the remuneration in three years. The Zhehu cooperative stipulated that half of the 22,190 work points used for capital construction projects such as building dams, reservoirs, and afforestation would be distributed in 1956, and half would be paid in 1957.

Handling of Non-Production Labor: Initially, some cooperatives planned to cancel all non-production labor, which caused panic among some cooperative staff. The county committee corrected the practice of canceling everything and proposed that strict control should be exercised in the future and that appropriate handling should be carried out at present. According to the opinion of the county committee, these five cooperatives made the following arrangements:

(1) Labor days recorded for holding cooperative member mass meetings, all cadre meetings, and all relevant personnel meetings in the village, as well as for parades, propaganda, entertainment, attending people's schools, watching operas, watching movies, and participating in mass meetings held by the county, district, township, and village, and labor days recorded for various meetings held when the majority of cooperative members could not go to the fields for production, were canceled by the cooperative members after explaining the reasons to the cooperative members, and did not participate in the distribution.

(2) For temporary or technical work done by cooperative members invited by other cooperatives, between cooperatives and cooperative members, and by state-owned enterprises, government agencies, and organizations to agricultural cooperatives, the inviting party paid the remuneration, and the recorded labor days did not participate in the distribution.

(3) Social labor, such as labor for weddings, funerals, and marriages, did not participate in the distribution.

(4) Township staff subsidized by the state and cooperative staff subsidized by the cooperative's quota who attended various meetings in the county, district, township, and in the village or whose work was delayed for the cooperative's work did not participate in the distribution. These people participated in cooperative production labor and recorded work points separately, participating in cooperative distribution. If they had difficulties in life due to excessive missed work, they could be given appropriate subsidies from the public welfare fund after discussion by the cooperative committee and approval by the cooperative members.

(5) Party members, League members, Women's Federation members, and militiamen who attended meetings or participated in training in the county, district, and township generally did not record labor days and did not participate in the distribution. If their families had difficulties in life due to too much missed work, they also adopted the method of subsidizing them appropriately from the public welfare fund after discussion by the cooperative committee and approval by the cooperative members.

(6) The remuneration of nursery staff, kindergarten teachers, midwives, and health workers was borne by those who enjoyed the welfare, and the recorded labor days did not participate in the distribution.

(7) Labor days recorded for participating in technical training, being assigned to visit, internship, etc., all participated in the distribution.

(8) Cooperative staff and cooperative members who were not subsidized by the state or the cooperative's quota, and the work points recorded for cooperative affairs meetings and work, all participated in the distribution; the work points recorded for participating in all administrative meetings did not participate in the distribution, and their remuneration was borne by the labor force responsible for fulfilling the obligations.

As a result of handling according to the above methods, a total of 176,290 work points participated in the wheat season distribution in these five cooperatives (including the estimated 61,719 work points to be invested from now until the wheat harvest). More than 20,000 capital construction work points and non-production work points did not participate in the distribution. This ensured that the value of labor days would not be reduced, relatively increasing the actual income of cooperative members in the wheat season.

Prevent Overestimation of Income and Underestimation of Expenses, Retaining Too Much and Distributing Too Little

After clearing the income account and the labor work point account, the public accumulation fund, public welfare fund, agricultural tax, seeds for next year, production management fees for the second half of the year, regulatory grain, and reserve grain, as well as the actual distribution account for cooperative members, were calculated according to the original plan. From the results of the calculation, due to the huge planned expenditures and the excessive amount of grain that needed to be retained, although production increased, the income of the cooperative members did not increase, and even decreased compared to last year. For example, in the Zhehu cooperative, the total wheat income of the cooperative was 348,177 jin. After deducting various expenses, 52,223 jin of regulatory grain and 17,406 jin of reserve grain were retained. As a result of this deduction, each labor day could only be distributed 1.125 jin of wheat. The other four cooperatives had similar situations. In order to effectively ensure the increase of the actual income of cooperative members, it was decided to solve it from the following two aspects:

(1) Based on the principle of continuously strengthening the socialist economy and not affecting the increase of income of cooperative members, the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund should be appropriately retained. Three different methods of retention were adopted in three types of regions. In the plain grain-producing areas, the area of wheat planting is large and the income is relatively large, so it is appropriate to retain more. In economic crop areas and mountainous areas, because autumn harvest is the main focus and wheat harvest is secondary, the method of retaining less in the wheat season and retaining more in the autumn season is adopted. Merged cooperatives and advanced cooperatives built without going through the primary stage, due to the poor foundation and low yield, decided to retain less or not retain at all, and try to distribute more to cooperative members, deducting it all at once after the autumn harvest. After review and reduction, the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund of the five cooperatives were retained 34,568 jin less than the original plan.

(2) Reduce expenditures under the principle of not affecting production: For the feed of collectively owned livestock in the cooperative, it was decided to use slack seasons to engage in transportation for self-sufficiency. If it cannot be completely self-sufficient, retain some appropriately to supplement the deficiency.

For fertilizer investment, adopt the method of making as much coarse fertilizer as possible and buying fine fertilizer appropriately to reduce expenditures. For the fertilizer and livestock wages invested by cooperative members in wheat fields, through consultation, adopt the method of paying less in the wheat season and more in the autumn season. For these two items alone, the five cooperatives retained a total of 259,195 jin less.

For the collective payment of public grain, state purchase grain, and seeds required for next year, conduct accurate accounting, retain appropriately, and strictly prevent overestimation of income and underestimation of expenses, and retaining too much. In addition to this, each cooperative no longer retains reserve grain and regulatory grain.

As a result of adopting the above various methods, the expenditures originally accounting for 37.4% of the total income were reduced to 31.1% of the total income. With the reduction of expenditures, the income of cooperative members increased relatively. A total of 1,278 cooperative members in the five cooperatives received more than last year, accounting for over 92% of the total number of households. These households received a total of 537,953 jin last year, and received 183,144 jin more this year, an average increase of 34%. A total of 111 households received less than last year, accounting for 8% of the total number of households. These households received a total of 92,201 jin last year, and received 22,099 jin less this year, a decrease of 24%.

Solving the Problem of 8% of Households with Reduced Income

What should be done about cooperative members with reduced income? According to the analysis of each cooperative, the households with reduced income are roughly of the following types: First, the dependents of martyrs, soldiers, and workers who have no labor force. Last year, they enjoyed farming subsidies. This year, the remuneration for land was canceled, and the farming subsidy was also canceled, so their income was reduced; second, widowed and orphaned households with no labor force; third, middle peasants with a lot of land, large yields, and little labor force. In addition, a small number of households reduced their income due to lack of enthusiasm for labor.

For cooperative members with less income who are affected in life, the following measures were decided after research by the branch and discussion by the cooperative members:

For old and weak cooperative members who have completely lost their labor force, subsidize them with public welfare funds according to their consumption needs.

For those who still have some labor force, find suitable farm work for them to participate in labor, and the cooperative will appropriately subsidize the insufficient income.

Special care should be given to the dependents of martyrs and soldiers so that their living standards are not lower than the living standards of ordinary cooperative members.

For cooperative members who have a labor force but do not actively produce and therefore reduce their income, conduct labor education on them and help them participate in labor. If they have difficulties in life at present, the cooperative will borrow work days in advance to participate in profit sharing, and make up for the shortfalls after the autumn harvest.

Adjusting and Regulating Wheat Quantity and Quality

This year, there are more large cooperatives, mostly one cooperative per village or several cooperatives per township. Due to the large number of households in the cooperative and the dispersed residences, the attendance rate is unbalanced. The difference in wheat quality and quantity within a cooperative is huge. Wheat must be adjusted and regulated well in order to complete the distribution work in a timely and reasonable manner. For example, the Zhehu Agricultural Cooperative is a large cooperative formed by the merger of cooperatives from six villages in two townships. The closest distance in the cooperative is four li, and the general distance is eight li. The Liangyuandian production station of the cooperative planted a lot of wheat. After deducting the public accumulation fund, public welfare fund, other expenses, and the number of points that cooperative members should score, there are still more than 20,000 jin left. The Mozhuang production station planted less wheat. After deducting the public accumulation fund, public welfare fund, and other expenses, the number of points for cooperative members to allocate is still short of 806 jin. If these two stations lack one and have one to spare, and transport grain back and forth, it will waste a lot of labor and delay time. In response to this situation, it was decided to deduct agricultural taxes from the Liangyuandian production station and retain more public accumulation funds and public welfare funds. The Moshizhuang production station did not deduct agricultural taxes and public accumulation, which solved the problem of transporting grain back and forth.

In addition, the number of work points for cooperative members in the six villages of the Zhehu cooperative is also very unbalanced. The average number of work points for each labor force in the Zhehu village is 51; 55 in Niuzhuang; and 67 in Mozhuang. In order to implement the principle of more work, more gain, and at the same time take care of the common increase in income, it was determined to use 55 work points in Niuzhuang as the basis for distribution according to the original contracting and production standards, and to find each other after the autumn harvest. In this way, the current contradiction between the uneven number of work points in each village is resolved.

Regarding the adjustment of wheat quality, it was decided that when distributing, the wheat from the upwind and downwind areas should be mixed evenly. At the same time, each time the wheat is threshed, five to ten jin should be taken out, dried, and used as a standard to calculate the number of dry wheat actually distributed to each household. In this way, the contradiction between the team and the team, the household and the household, that the quality of wheat varies greatly and the wet and dry wheat are different, is also resolved.

Revising the Annual Financial Income and Expenditure Plan

Through the formulation of the wheat distribution plan, the five cooperatives have revised their annual income and expenditure plans, expanded production channels, reduced expenditures, and ensured increased income for cooperative members. For example, the Zhehu cooperative reduced expenditures on the one hand and expanded sideline production such as silkworm breeding, beekeeping, and sheep raising on the other hand. The annual income can be increased by 72,134 yuan, and each cooperative member in the cooperative can increase their income by 104.8 yuan. The Dongchuankou cooperative used the labor days originally planned for building houses and other non-production construction in production aspects such as water conservancy construction, expanding cultivated land, and sideline industries, which can increase grain income by 30,990 jin, plus 100,629 jin of grain reduction by reducing expenditures, for a total increase in income of 131,619 jin, and each person in the cooperative can increase their grain income by an average of 447 jin.

    怎样进行小麦预分
    中共河北省邢台县委书记　张玉美
    今年的小麦分配是邢台县实现完全社会主义农业合作化以后的新工作，各级干部都缺乏经验。为了做好这项工作，中共邢台县委抽出了得力干部组成五个工作组，于四月二十六日到全县有代表性的折虎、东川口、南王段、孝子村、前炉子等五个农业生产合作社进行了小麦预分试点工作，吸取经验。
    这五个社有大社、小社、扩建社、合并社，共一千三百八十九户，耕种着一万六千三百七十二亩水旱地。今年播种小麦占耕地的40.4％。总产小麦预计为一百一十八万九千三百零三斤，比1955年亩产提高29.4％。试算预分结果，五个社的社员比1955年多分的占总户数的92％强。
    小麦预分工作是按照“按劳取酬，多劳多得”的分配原则和积极增加社内公共财产，又保证90％以上社员增加实际收入的精神进行的。
    评产要确实
    正确评定小麦产量，是做好小麦预分的一个重要条件。为了防止偏高偏低现象，各社在评产中，采取的办法是：一、逐块勘查，逐块评议。如孝子村社先由全体负责评产人员到地里集体观察，看出收成情况，再分成小组，逐块勘查，逐块评议。这种办法比较细致准确，但是跑腿、误工多一些，如麦地太多就跑不过来。二、先分析水旱地的不同土质，按土质分成若干经济区，每个区再分为上、中、下三等，由评产组到各经济区进行实查，找出有代表性的地块，评出产量；然后进行分类排队，以此类推，评出全社麦地产量。产量经社员通过变成决议以后，降低5％—10％作为机动数。这种办法较好。
    适当处理非生产用工
    在清工结账当中，控制基本建设用工和削减非生产用工是保证增加社员实际收入的一个环节。这五个社清工结账的结果是：截至制定预分方案的时候为止，共投工十三万五千四百七十六个，其中农、副业生产用工占73.58％，基本建设用工占21.52％，非生产用工占4.9％。从这个结果看来，基本建设用工和非生产用工数量显然过大，如果全计为劳动日参加分配，势必降低劳动日价值，如果完全不参加分配，将给今后进行基本建设和社务工作造成困难，因此，对这一部分用工必须进行妥善处理。这五个社处理的办法归纳如下：
    对基本建设用工的处理：当年能收到效益的或虽然当年不能收效但是用工较少的，如积肥、打井、修地、铲边、复堰等一般都规定参加当年分配。当年收益很小或者当年没有收益而工程大、用工多的，一般根据收益时间，采取逐年付清报酬的办法。如前炉子社修建二十间鸡房、三个猪圈、开荒、改路、修建二十六间牲口棚等共用的二千七百九十二个工，确定三年付清报酬。折虎社对打坝、打库、造林等项基本建设用的二万二千一百九十个工，规定一半在1956年分配，一半到1957年付给。
    对非生产用工的处理：最初，有的社对非生产用工准备一律取消，曾引起一些社内工作人员的恐慌。县委纠正了一律取消的作法，提出了今后严加控制，目前适当处理的意见。根据县委意见，这五个社作了如下处理：
    （一）在村召开的社员群众会、全体干部会，各部门召开的有关人员全体会议，进行游行、宣传、娱乐、上民校学习、看戏、看电影及参加县、区、乡、村召开的群众性会议等所记的劳动日，以及在多数社员不能下地生产的时间召开的各种会议所记的劳动日，经过向社员群众讲清道理，由社员自报取消，不参加分配。
    （二）社和社之间，社和社员之间以及国营企业、机关团体到农业合作社邀请社员作临时工或技术工，由邀请一方付给报酬，所记的劳动日不参加分配。
    （三）社会性的用工，如婚、丧、嫁、娶用工不参加分配。
    （四）受国家补贴的乡工作人员和受社定额补贴的社工作人员到县、区、乡以及在本村参加各种会议或为社工作误工所记劳动日，不参加分配。这些人参加社内生产劳动另记工分，参加社内分配。如因误工过多生活发生困难，经社委会研究，社员通过，可以从公益金中给以适当补助。
    （五）党员、团员、妇联会会员、民兵到县、区、乡开会或参加训练，一般的也不记劳动日，不参加分配，如误工太多家庭生活发生困难，也采取经社委会研究社员通过的办法从公益金中给以适当补助。
    （六）保育员、幼儿教师、接生员、保健员的报酬，由享受该项福利的人承担，所记劳动日不参加分配。
    （七）参加技术训练误工、被分配去参观、实习等所记的劳动日都参加分配。
    （八）不受国家补贴和社的定额补贴的社的工作人员、社员，为社务开会和工作所记的工分，均参加分配；参加一切行政会所记的工分，不参加分配，他们的报酬由应负义务的劳力分摊负担。
    照上述办法处理的结果，这五个社参加麦季分配的工共十七万六千二百九十个（包括从现在到麦收时候预计投工六万一千七百一十九个在内）。有二万多个基本建设用工和非生产用工都不参加分配。这就保证了劳动日的价值不致降低，相对地增加了社员麦季的实际收入。
    防止宽打窄用，多留少分
    收入账和劳动工账结清以后，照原定计划算出公积金、公益金、农业税、来年籽种以及后半年的生产管理费、调剂粮、机动粮等项开支账和社员实际分配账。从计算的结果看来，由于原计划开支庞大，需要扣留的粮食过多，虽然生产增加了，社员收入并没有增加，甚至反而比去年减少了。如折虎社，全社收入小麦三十四万八千一百七十七斤，扣除各项开支外又留出调剂粮五万二千二百二十三斤，机动粮一万七千四百零六斤，这样扣的结果，每一个劳动日只能分得小麦一斤九两。其他四个社均有类似情况。为了切实保证增加社员实际收入，决定从以下两方面加以解决：
    （一）本着不断增强社会主义经济和不影响社员增加收入的原则，适当扣留公积金、公益金。三种地区采取了三种不同的扣留方法。平原产粮区种麦面积大，收入较多，适当多留。经济作物区及山区，因以秋收为主麦收为辅，采取麦季少留，秋季多留的办法。合并社和不经过初级阶段建起来的高级社，由于基础差、产量低，决定少留或不留，尽量让社员多分，秋后一次扣清。经过审查缩减，五个社的公积金和公益金比原计划少留三万四千五百六十八斤。
    （二）在不影响生产的原则下缩减开支：对于社内公有牲口饲料，决定利用农闲搞运输自给，不能完全自给的适当扣留一些，以补助不足。
    对于肥料投资，采取尽量多造粗肥，适当买细肥的办法减少开支。对社员向麦地所投肥料和牲口工资，通过协商，采取麦季少还，秋季多还的办法。只这两项，五个社共少扣二十五万九千一百九十五斤。
    对于集体缴纳的公粮、国家征购粮和来年所需的籽种，进行精确核算，适当扣留，严防宽打窄用，存留过多。除此以外，各社均不再扣留机动粮和调剂粮。
    采用上述各种办法的结果，把原来占总收入37.4％的开支压缩到占总收入31.1％。开支缩减了，社员收入相对增多。五个社比去年多分的社员共一千二百七十八户，占总户数的92％强。这些户去年共分五十三万七千九百五十三斤，今年多分了十八万三千一百四十四斤，平均提高了34％。比去年少分户一百一十一户，占总户数的8％。这些户去年共分九万二千二百零一斤，今年少分二万二千零九十九斤，降低了24％。
    解决8％减少收入户的问题
    收入减少的社员怎么办呢？据各社分析，收入减少的户大体上是这几种类型户：一是无劳力的烈、军、工属，去年他们是享受代耕补助的，今年土地取消报酬，代耕随之取消，他们的收入因而减少了；一是孤寡无劳力户；一是地多产量大劳力少的中农。此外，有少数户是因劳动不积极而减少收入的。
    对少收而影响生活的社员，经支部研究和社员讨论，决定采取下列办法：
    对完全失去劳动力的老弱社员，按照消费需要，用公益金补助。
    对多少还有些劳动力的，找出适当农活，让他们参加劳动，收入不足部分由社适当补助。
    对烈军属要特别照顾，使他们的生活不低于一般社员生活水平。
    有劳力而不积极生产因而减收的社员，对他们进行劳动教育，帮助他们参加劳动。眼下生活有困难的，由社预借劳动日参加分红，秋后长退短补。
    麦子多少好坏的搭配调剂
    今年大社较多，大都是一村一社或数乡一社。由于社大户多，居住分散，出勤率又不平衡，一社之中麦子好坏、多少悬殊，必须做好麦子搭配调剂，才能够及时地合理地完成分配工作。如折虎农业合作社是由两个乡六个村的社合并成的大社。全社范围距离最近的是四里，一般是八里。本社梁元店生产站种的小麦多，扣除公积金、公益金、其他开支和社员应分数以后，尚余二万多斤。磨庄生产站种麦少，扣公积金、公益金和其它开支，社员分配的尚缺八百零六斤。这两个站一缺一余，相距七、八里地，如往返运粮，将浪费不少劳力而且耽误时间。针对这种情况，决定从梁元店生产站扣农业税，多留公积金、公益金，磨石庄生产站不扣农业税和公共积累，这样就解决了往返运粮问题。
    另外折虎社的六个村，社员劳动的工数也很不平衡，折虎村每个劳力平均投工五十一个；牛庄五十五个；而磨庄每个劳力投工达六十七个。为了贯彻执行多劳多得的原则，同时又照顾到共同增加收入，确定以牛庄五十五个工为依据，按原来包工包产的标准进行分配，秋收后互相找齐。这样，就解决了当前各村出工多少不均的矛盾。
    关于麦子好坏的调剂，决定在分配的时候，把上风头和下风头的麦子搅拌均匀，同时每打一场麦，要取出五至十斤，晒干作为标准，折算出各户实分的干麦数目。这样，队和队、户和户所分麦子好坏悬殊、湿干不同的矛盾也就解决了。
    修订全年财务收支计划
    通过制定小麦分配方案，五个社都修订了全年收支计划，扩大了生产门路，缩减了开支，保证社员增加收入。如折虎社一面缩减开支，一面扩大养蚕、养蜂、养羊等副业生产，全年可增加收入七万二千一百三十四元，全社每户社员均能增加一百零四元八角的收入。东川口社把原计划用于盖房等非生产建设方面的劳动日用于兴修水利、扩大耕地、副业等生产方面，可增加粮食收入三万零九百九十斤，再加上缩减开支折粮十万零六百二十九斤，总共可增加收入十三万一千六百一十九斤，全社每人平均可多收入粮食四百四十七斤。
