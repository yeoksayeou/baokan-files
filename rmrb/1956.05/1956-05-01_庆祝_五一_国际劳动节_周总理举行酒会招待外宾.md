Our meeting this time is not only in the most beautiful and vibrant season of the year, but also at a time when the peace-loving people of all countries have brought about a new atmosphere in the international situation. Just as people are full of hope in spring to welcome the new year, the peace-loving people of all countries, under the new international situation, have growing confidence in consolidating world peace and striving for a better future.

The Chinese people will continue to work with the people of other countries to play their part in easing international tensions. In particular, the Chinese people must draw strength from the wisdom and experience of the people of other countries to strengthen their ongoing peaceful construction work. May our friendly exchanges become more frequent! May our peaceful cooperation be strengthened day by day!"
