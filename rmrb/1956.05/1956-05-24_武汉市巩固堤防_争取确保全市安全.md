    Wuhan Reinforces Dikes
    Striving to Ensure the Safety of the Entire City
    (Our newspaper's Wuhan dispatch, May 23rd) Wuhan's pre-flood season dike projects have been basically completed. A 166-kilometer-long dike protects the entire city.
    In recent days, the Yangtze River's water level has begun to rise sharply. On the 22nd, the Wuhan Customs' water level had risen to 23.32 meters, 0.67 meters higher than the water level on the same day in 1954. In order to prevent waterlogging in the city during the flood season, an electric pumping station with 3,000 to 4,000 horsepower is being installed. Around the construction site of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, more than 1,000 dike workers are working in the rain to reinforce a water-isolation embankment, to ensure that the construction site is not threatened by waterlogging from the inland lakes.
    The Dike Joint Inspection Team, composed of responsible persons from relevant Wuhan units and the People's Committees of various districts, conducted a comprehensive inspection of the city's dikes in early May. They discovered several loopholes and substandard quality areas, and have urged the water conservancy departments to deal with them promptly. The Wuhan Water Conservancy Department has also initially formulated this year's flood prevention plan, striving to ensure the safety of Wuhan City under any circumstances.
    Over the past year or so, the dikes of Wuhan City have been repaired and rebuilt, and all have exceeded the local highest flood level of 1954 by one meter to one and a half meters. The important dikes protecting Wuhan City—the Zhanggong Dike in Hankou and the Wuqing Dike in Wuchang—have both been widened by about one time. New dikes have been built in the riverside areas of Hanyang and Hankou, which had no dikes in 1954. Riprap has been built and wave-resistant forests have been planted on the dike sections that are more exposed to wind and waves.

### 武汉市巩固堤防  争取确保全市安全

    武汉市巩固堤防
    争取确保全市安全
    本报武汉23日电　武汉市今年汛前的堤防工程已基本完工，长达166公里的堤防捍卫着整个城市。
    近几天来，长江水位开始猛涨，二十二日的武汉关水位已涨到二十三点三二公尺，比1954年同天水位高出零点六七公尺。为了防止汛期市内发生渍水现象，一座拥有三千至四千马力的电力抽水机站正在安装。在武汉钢铁公司建设工地周围，有一千多名堤工正在冒雨抢修一道隔水围堤，以保障建设工地不受内湖渍水的威胁。
    由武汉市各有关单位和各区人民委员会负责人组成的堤防联合检查组，在五月上旬对全市堤防作了一次全面检查，发现若干漏洞和质量不合格的地方，已督促水利部门及时加以处理。武汉市水利部门也初步制定出今年的防汛方案，要争取在任何情况下确保武汉市安全。
    一年多来，武汉市的堤防经过培修翻筑，都已超过1954年当地最高洪水一公尺至一公尺半。保卫武汉市的重要干堤——汉口张公堤和武昌武青堤都加宽了一倍左右。在1954年没有堤防的汉阳和汉口沿河地带都筑起新堤。风浪较大的堤段也分别修筑了坦坡和种植了防浪林。
