Xinhua News Agency, 11th. Nicosia Dispatch: Disregarding the protests of the Cypriot and Greek people, the British colonial authorities brutally hanged two Cypriot youths, Karaolis and Demetriou, on the morning of the 10th, who were fighting for national self-determination. After the news spread, shop assistants in Nicosia, dockworkers in Famagusta, and workers in many other towns in Cyprus immediately began strikes to protest the atrocities of the British colonialists.

　　In Paphos, people held memorial services for the two victims during the two hours of the lifting of the curfew on the 10th.

　　In Greece, public sentiment was equally indignant. Archbishop Dorotheos of Greece ordered church bells to toll throughout the country on the 10th as a sign of mourning. At the same time, the organization for the movement to merge Cyprus and Greece called for flags to be flown at half-mast nationwide for three days.

　　On the same evening, Greek Prime Minister Karamanlis convened a cabinet meeting to discuss the matter. After the meeting, Karamanlis issued a statement saying that the British authorities' execution of the two youths was "shameful," and that the execution of these two youths and the exile of Archbishop Makarios "prove that Britain's policy in Cyprus is wrong." He said that Britain should not insist on maintaining order by force first, but should first seek a political solution to achieve peace.

    英殖民当局绞杀塞浦路斯爱国青年
    塞浦路斯和希腊人民愤怒抗议
    新华社11日讯　尼科西亚消息：英国殖民当局不顾塞浦路斯和希腊人民的抗议，悍然在十日上午绞死了争取民族自决的两个塞浦路斯青年卡拉奥利斯和德米特里乌。这个消息传出以后，尼科西亚的店员、法马古斯太港的码头工人以及塞浦路斯其他许多城镇的工人立刻开始罢工，抗议英国殖民者的暴行。
    在巴佛斯，人民在十日解除戒严的两小时中为这两位被害者举行了追悼会。
    在希腊，也同样群情激愤。希腊大主教多洛塞奥斯在十日下令全国教堂鸣钟志哀，同时，争取塞浦路斯和希腊合并运动的组织号召全国下半旗三天。
    同一天晚上，希腊首相卡拉曼利斯召开内阁会议就这件事进行了讨论。会后，卡拉曼利斯发表谈话说，英国当局处死两位青年的行动是“可耻的”，处死这两位青年和放逐马卡里奥斯大主教“证明英国在塞浦路斯的政策是不对的”。他说，英国不应该坚持先用武力维持秩序，而应该先谋求政治解决，求得和平。
