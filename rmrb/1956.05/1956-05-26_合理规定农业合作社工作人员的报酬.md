Reasonable Regulations for the Remuneration of Agricultural Cooperative Staff

Chang Qing

Editor's Note: The experience of regulating the remuneration of staff within agricultural production cooperatives, as introduced in this article, represents some preliminary experiences summarized by the Xingtai Regional Committee of Hebei Province and is provided for reference.

Currently, agricultural production cooperatives are generally expanding, and the number of staff has also increased. Reasonably resolving the issue of remuneration for staff engaged in management work has become a very important task. However, many cooperatives currently lack experience in this area. Agricultural production cooperatives in the Xingtai area of Hebei Province have broadly adopted the following four approaches to address this issue: (1) Temporary work calculation, where cadres record work hours as they are missed from production, calculating and recording however much is missed. (2) Comprehensive contracting, where each staff member detached from production is assigned labor days equivalent to that of a medium-level laborer for the year, and no additional work points are calculated for staff participating in production. (3) Non-fixed subsidies of work points for cooperative staff, with subsidies determined at the end of the year based on work performance through evaluation. (4) Implementing a method combining fixed subsidies, fixed work production, and year-end rewards. This involves fixing both the remuneration each person should receive annually and the number of labor days they should participate in production, based on the complexity of the work they undertake and the amount of time they can potentially dedicate to productive labor. Earning more labor days results in higher income, and good management performance leads to evaluation and rewards at the end of the year.

Practice has proven that cooperatives adopting the first method often find that some staff are entangled in meetings, failing to engage in production even when they have time, severely impacting the production enthusiasm of the members and the unity between staff and members. For example, in Haoqiao Township Agricultural Cooperative in Nanhe County, there were 1,830 member households, 35 management committee members, 13 team leaders, 39 deputy team leaders, and 119 group leaders. Previously, this cooperative implemented a system where work points were given to whoever attended a meeting, leading to a scramble for participation. As a result, all staff members did not go to the fields to produce for a long time, and members complained: "Before increasing production, we have to feed two hundred people first."

The result of some cooperatives implementing the second method also similarly affected the enthusiasm of cooperative cadres to participate in field labor. For example, the Houweizhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Qinghe County originally planned to subsidize each of the fifteen staff members an average of 250 labor days per year, but the result was that no one was actively working or participating in production. The Jiasong Township Agricultural Cooperative in Nanhe County initially stipulated that cooperative staff members, regardless of whether they attended meetings or worked in the fields, would uniformly receive five work points per day within the cooperative. Of the twenty-three committee members in the entire cooperative, they only worked thirty-six workdays in seventy days, with no one leaving the office. They said: "Whether you work hard or slowly, it's still five work points."

The third method also has shortcomings, mainly that cooperative staff members have no certainty and are not at ease with their work. For example, some staff members of the Gecun Agricultural Cooperative in Shahe County reflected, "I am a good laborer, but who knows what kind of evaluation I will get at the end of the year? Being a staff member is not as good as being a member."

From the existing experience, only the fourth method is relatively reasonable. This method can promote the efficiency and active participation in productive labor of cooperative staff members; at the same time, it can also enable staff members to understand the situation, solve problems, and improve leadership through participation in production. For example, the Xijing'an Agricultural Cooperative in Xingtai County, with a total of 128 households and five main staff members, subsidizes a total of 570 labor days (this cooperative estimates 250 labor days for each superior laborer). The amount of subsidy is determined according to the size of each staff member's responsibility, the lightness or heaviness of the task, and with reference to the strength of labor. The cooperative director, Zuo Qin, is a ten-point laborer, and the annual subsidy is 150 labor days. In addition to doing his job duties, he participates in 100 labor days of production, and can get 250 labor days for the whole year, reaching the income equivalent to a ten-point laborer. The accountant, Niu Jinfu, is a lame, eight-point laborer, but because the accounting work is complex and he misses a lot of work, he is subsidized 190 labor days for the whole year, and he participates in 50 labor days of production himself, and can get 240 labor days for the whole year, which is not much different from the annual income of an eight-point laborer. The deputy director, Zheng Qin, is an eight-point laborer, subsidizing him 80 labor days, and he works 150 labor days himself. These staff members no longer calculate work points for working for the cooperative, and they are paid more for exceeding the production quota. In order to allow the subsidized cooperative staff to do their work well, it is also stipulated that they will be evaluated at the end of the year based on their work attitude and performance. If the leadership work is done well and the production plan is overfulfilled, work points can be awarded from the excess production as appropriate; if losses are caused due to passive and irresponsible work and the expected output is not achieved, some work points can be deducted appropriately. After Xijing'an Cooperative determined this method, the staff members carried out specific division of labor, and basically completed the production plan and labor plan within half a month, implemented financial contracting, and also dealt with the property left over. Before spring plowing and sowing, in addition to the deputy director Zheng Qin and the accountant collecting seeds at home and formulating the draft of the production share fund and labor quota, the director and other three staff members led the members to the fields to produce. In production, they further solicited members' opinions on the work and stimulated the members' enthusiasm for production. For example, it used to take seven work points to dig one mu of land, but now it only takes five work points. After the cooperative staff experienced participating in production labor themselves, they had a better understanding of the work such as revising labor quotas.

Now, this method is being widely promoted in the Xingtai area. According to the experience of several advanced cooperatives, the following work needs to be done to implement this method:

First of all, is ideological education work. There is often a certain degree of contradiction between cooperative staff members and members on the fixed subsidy for staff members. The members said: "They sit in the house, open their mouths, move their pens, and work for a day, how can they be worth one of our labor days." The cooperative staff members have a different evaluation of their work, they say: "When you become a staff member, you run until your legs break, wear out your mouth, dry your eyes, and exhaust your heart." To solve this contradiction, it is necessary to conduct education on distribution according to work, overcome the members' view of underestimating mental labor, and at the same time correct the staff members' tendency to demand excessive remuneration. For example, Fan Zhixiang, the director of the Supervisory Committee of the Sansi Township Agricultural Cooperative in Nanhe County, can participate in 200 labor days of production throughout the year. When he initially planned to subsidize him with 50 labor days, he felt it was too little. After education, he made a self-criticism.

Secondly, it is necessary to help the cooperative improve its leadership and reduce the time that cooperative staff members spend delaying production. For example, in the Jiasong Township Agricultural Cooperative in Nanhe County, because there was no plan for work in the previous period, the twenty-three committee members held meetings every day and could not participate in production labor. When they began to study the fixed subsidy method, many of them disagreed with the method, and some said: "You can't ask us to work on an empty stomach." Later, the work team helped them check the previous work, clarified the responsibilities of each committee member, assigned them to teams, and uniformly arranged the weekly work, production, and study time, and tried to use the evening to hold meetings. After this arrangement, in twenty-one days, the twenty-three committee members completed 153 labor days of work in addition to doing their jobs well. Now everyone is very satisfied with the fixed subsidy method.

Thirdly, it is necessary to correct the tendency of cooperatives to arbitrarily calculate work points. Some cooperative staff members proposed: "If we implement a fixed subsidy, it is also unreasonable if the phenomenon of arbitrarily calculating work points in the cooperative is not corrected." The Zanshan Village Agricultural Cooperative in Shahe County solved the problem of arbitrarily calculating work points while implementing the fixed subsidy method. They stipulated that Party and League members are not allowed to calculate work points in the cooperative for attending meetings, receiving training, and participating in general social activities or mass visits. For non-productive construction labor, compulsory labor can be calculated, which is shared equally by the labor force of the entire cooperative and is not distributed as dividends in the cooperative, but the compulsory labor borne by each laborer throughout the year shall not exceed three. The work points that the childcare staff of the childcare group should receive shall be borne by the parents of the children. The cooperative staff members have no objection to doing so.

    合理规定农业合作社工作人员的报酬
    常青
    编者按：这篇文章介绍的规定农业生产合作社内工作人员报酬办法的经验，是河北省邢台地委总结的一些初步经验，可供各地参考。
    现在农业生产合作社一般都扩大了，社的工作人员也多了，合理解决工作人员在管理工作上的报酬问题，已经成为一项很重要的工作。但是这项工作目前许多合作社都还没有经验。河北省邢台地区的农业生产合作社对这个问题大致采取了以下四种解决办法：（一）临时计工，就是干部误工随时计工，误多少计多少。（二）大包干，一年包给每个脱离生产的工作人员相当一个中等劳力的劳动日，工作人员参加生产不再另外计工。（三）不固定社的工作人员补贴工数，到年终根据工作情况进行评议补贴。（四）实行定额补贴、定工生产和年终奖励相结合的办法。就是按照工作人员所担负工作的繁简程度和他们可能参加生产劳动的时间多少，把每人每年应给的报酬和应参加生产的劳动日都固定下来。多做劳动日可以多得，管理工作搞得好，年终还评议给奖。
    实践证明，实行第一种办法的社往往使得一些社的工作人员纠缠在会议上，有工夫也不下地生产，严重地影响社员的生产积极性和工作人员、社员之间的团结。像南和县郝桥乡农业合作社，共有社员1，830户，管理委员三十五人，中队长十三人，分队长三十九人，小组长119人。前一个时期这个社实行谁开会给谁计工的办法，大家就争着参加会。这样，很长时间所有工作人员都不下地生产，社员不满地说：增产不增产先得养活二百口人吃饭。
    有些社实行第二种办法的结果，也同样影响社干部参加田间劳动的积极性。如清河县后魏庄农业合作社原计划十五个工作人员平均每人一年补给二百五十个劳动日，结果是谁也不积极工作和参加生产。南和县贾宋乡农业合作社开始规定社的工作人员不论开会、下地劳动，每人每天在社内一律计五分工，全社二十三个委员，七十天当中只做了三十六个工作日，谁也不离开办公室。他们说：“紧干慢干反正五分工”。
    第三种办法也有缺点，主要是社工作人员心中无底，工作不安心。如沙河县葛村农业合作社有的工作人员反映“我是个好劳力，谁知道年底给评个什么样，当工作人员不如当社员”。
    从目前已有经验看来，只有第四种办法比较合理。这种办法可以促使社的工作人员提高工作效率和积极参加生产劳动；同时还可以使工作人员通过参加生产及时了解情况，解决问题，改进领导。如邢台县西静庵农业合作社共128户，五个主要工作人员，共补贴五百七十个劳动日（这个社每个上等劳力以二百五十个劳动日预计）。根据每个工作人员责任的大小，任务的轻重，并且参照劳力强弱，确定补贴多少。社长左琴是十分劳力，全年补贴一百五十个劳动日，他除做好职务以内的工作外，再参加生产一百个劳动日，全年就可得250个劳动日，达到相当于十分劳力的收入。会计牛金福是个拐腿，八分劳力，但是因为会计工作复杂，误工很多，全年补贴他一百九十个劳动日，自己再参加生产五十个劳动日，全年可得二百四十个劳动日，和八分劳力的全年收入也相差不多。副社长郑钦八分劳力，补贴他八十个劳动日，自己出工一百五十个劳动日。这些工作人员为社工作不再计工，超过生产定工，多劳多得。为了让受补贴的社工作人员做好工作，并且规定：根据工作态度，成绩大小，年终评议。如果领导工作做的好，超额完成生产计划，还可从超产部分酌情奖给工分；如果因工作消极不负责任，造成损失，达不到应有产量，可适当扣除一些工分。西静安社在确定这个办法以后，工作人员进行了具体分工，半月以内基本上作好了生产规划和劳动规划，实行了财务包干，财产遗留问题也作了处理。在春耕播种之前，除副社长郑钦和会计在家收集籽种，制定生产股份基金和劳动定额草案以外，正社长等三个工作人员带领社员下地生产。他们在生产中进一步征求社员对工作的意见，激发了社员的生产积极性。如过去挖一亩地用七个工，现在只用五个工。社的工作人员经过自己亲身参加生产劳动的体验，对修改劳动定额等工作心里更有了底。
    现在邢台地区正在普遍推广这一办法。根据若干先进社的经验，实行这个办法需要做以下一些工作：
    首先是思想教育工作。社的工作人员和社员之间对工作人员定额补助常存有一定程度的矛盾。社员说：“他们坐在屋里，张张嘴，动动笔，工作一天，怎么也不能顶咱们一个劳动日。”社的工作人员对自己工作却是另一种评价，他们说：当上工作人员，跑断腿，磨破嘴，熬干眼，累煞心。要解决这个矛盾，就需要进行按劳取酬的教育，克服社员轻视脑力劳动的观点，同时纠正工作人员对报酬要求过高的偏向。如南和县三思乡农业合作社监察委员会主任范治祥，全年能参加生产二百个劳动日，开始计划补助他五十个劳动日的时候，他嫌少。经过教育，他作了检讨。
    其次，要帮助合作社改进领导，减少社的工作人员耽误生产的时间。如南和县贾宋乡农业合作社，在前一个时期因为工作没计划，二十三个委员天天开会，不能参加生产劳动。在开始研究定额补助办法的时候，他们中间有很多人都不同意这个办法，有的说：总不能叫饿着肚子作工作。后来，工作组帮助他们检查了前一段工作，明确了各个委员的责任，分工包队，又统一安排了每周的工作、生产和学习时间，并且尽量利用晚上开会。经过这样安排之后，在二十一天的时间内，二十三个委员除作好工作外，还做了153个劳动日的工。现在大家对定额补助的办法都很满意。
    第三，要纠正合作社乱计工分的偏向。有的社的工作人员提出：我们实行定额补贴，社内乱计工分的现象不纠正也不合理。沙河县赞善村农业合作社在实行定额补贴办法的同时，解决了乱计工分的问题。他们规定：党、团员开会、受训和参加一般社会活动或群众性的参观等都不准在社内计工。非生产性的建设用工，可计义务工，由全社劳动力均摊，不在社内分红，但每个劳力所负担的义务工全年不得超过三个。托儿组的保教人员应得的工分，由儿童的父母分担。这样做社的工作人员都没有意见了。
