　　Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions
    A letter from the Chongqing Branch of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration: The facts revealed in the letter "Eliminate Grain Losses During Shipping" on the "Reader's Letters" page on February 14 are correct. Most of these maritime losses have been dealt with; personnel derelict in their duties have been given administrative punishments or sentenced by the courts. In order to strengthen leadership, we have formulated a preliminary plan this year, according to instructions from higher authorities, to eliminate maritime losses.
    A letter from the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture: After the "Reader's Letters" page on February 19 criticized our bureau for carelessly arranging the purchase of cattle, resulting in huge losses, we immediately convened a bureau affairs meeting for further inspection. Leaders of our bureau generally arrange work in a generalized way and lack in-depth inspection and specific assistance to lower-level units. This bureaucratic style must be overcome in the future. In addition, we have also dealt with the relevant personnel who were derelict in their duties regarding this incident.
    After the "Reader's Letters" page published the reader's letter "The 'People's Reception Room' That Doesn't Receive People" on February 5, the Jiangjin Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Sichuan Province has sent a letter of self-criticism. They have studied the work of handling letters and visits from the people and have assigned special personnel to be responsible for handling letters from the people and receiving visitors.
    A letter from the General Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of the Jilin Provincial Farm Tool Factory: The criticism of the conservative thinking of our factory's leading cadres on the "Reader's Letters" page on March 5 is correct. Under the specific leadership of the higher-level Party committee, we launched a struggle from top to bottom against right-leaning conservative thought, and launched a movement to study and promote advanced experiences and widely solicit rationalization proposals among the workers.

　　批评建议的反应
    长江航运管理局重庆分局来信：二月十四日“读者来信专页”上“杜绝粮食在航运途中的损失”一信所揭发的事实是正确的。这些海损事故，大部分已经作了处理；失职人员也分别受到行政处分或由法院判刑。为了加强领导，今年我们已经按上级指示，作出了消灭海损事故的初步规划。
    农业部畜牧兽医局来信：二月十九日“读者来信专页”对我局草率布置买牛工作、造成巨大损失的事件提出批评后，我们立即召开局务会议作了进一步的检查。我局领导人布置工作一般化，对下级单位的工作缺乏深入检查和具体帮助，这种官僚主义作风在今后一定要加以克服。此外，我们对这一事件的有关失职人员也进行了处理。
    二月五日“读者来信专页”发表了“不接待人民的‘人民接待室’”的读者来信以后，四川省江津专署已经来信作了检讨。他们已经对人民来信来访工作进行了研究，并且配备了专人负责处理人民来信和接待来访。
    中共吉林省农具厂总支委员会来信：三月五日“读者来信专页”对我厂领导干部的保守思想提出的批评是正确的。我们在上级党委的具体领导下从上而下地向右倾保守思想展开了斗争，并且在职工群众中展开了学习和推广先进经验，广泛地提合理化建议的运动。
