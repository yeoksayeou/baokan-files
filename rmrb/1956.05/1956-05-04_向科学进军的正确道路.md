　　The Correct Path to Advance Towards Science

It has been thirty-seven years since the May Fourth Movement put forward the slogans of "science" and "democracy." In these thirty-seven years, China's situation has undergone tremendous changes. The democratic slogan put forward in those years has been thoroughly realized; and the task of developing science already has more favorable conditions and more practical significance than it did in those years.

Inheriting the glorious tradition of the May Fourth Movement, China's youth are currently launching a surge to advance towards science. They have formulated personal study plans, organized amateur scientific research groups, and are engaging in amateur self-study. They are eager to master advanced science and technology and become construction talents with a high level of culture; and they are working with their predecessors to strive to bring China's most urgently needed scientific departments close to the advanced levels of the world in a not-too-long period. This enthusiasm of China's younger generation to advance towards science is extremely valuable. We must cherish this enthusiasm of the youth and help them determine the direction of their advance towards science.

To advance towards science, one must have a tenacious spirit and a scientific attitude, and establish a good style of study that is based on seeking truth from facts, diligently studying, and boldly discovering scientific truths. There are no shortcuts in science. All the scientific masters in the world were able to make brilliant contributions to mankind because they made long-term, arduous efforts and endured countless setbacks and failures. Therefore, the young people of our country who are striding forward on the road to science today must also have the courage to overcome all difficulties, have the determination to conduct long-term research, and be prepared to contribute their life's energy to science. Young people should humbly learn from their predecessors and all experienced people, and never be complacent or arrogant. Science is endless, and young people cannot be satisfied with merely inheriting the legacy of their predecessors. They should actively strive to push the cause of science to new heights, learn to independently solve various complex problems in national construction, and use their creative labor to enrich the world's knowledge treasury. To achieve success in scientific work, one must rely on independent thinking and avoid blindly following others or imitating them. One should strive for the guidance of others, but should not have the slightest sense of dependence; learn from the strengths of others, but should not be bound by the experience of others. In this way, one can move forward with great strides.

To advance towards science, one must start from one's current level and from mastering one's own business. Some young people believe that advancing towards science is merely engaging in academic research, which is not entirely true. The scope of advancing towards science is extremely broad, including not only academic research but also mastering professional skills and improving cultural knowledge. Those with low cultural levels should first improve their cultural level; those who are unfamiliar with their business should first familiarize themselves with it; those who lack basic scientific knowledge should strengthen their studies in basic science; and those who have the ability to work independently in scientific research can specialize in their own profession. In short, one must proceed step by step, study diligently, and avoid being ambitious and wanting to reach the sky in one step. The so-called starting from mastering one's own business is to combine further study with work in accordance with the needs of national construction. Because every business has scientific and theoretical problems, and scientific achievements cannot be separated from understanding practical knowledge. In our society, learning and application are basically consistent; the work that each young person undertakes is needed by the country. Except for a few people who are completely competent in their current jobs and have the spare energy to learn another skill, most people should work hard in their current positions and strive to become experts in their own fields, and should not lightly abandon this line of work to do that line of work. Therefore, we should adhere to the policy of amateur study and avoid opposing study and work.

Some young people believe that advancing towards science is merely to obtain a certain degree within a few years. Of course, it is a great honor for a person to obtain a certain degree, and the state is preparing to implement a system of honorary degrees and academic titles. However, obtaining academic titles and degrees only indicates a person's achievements on the road to science, and is not the purpose of scientific research itself. The reason why we conduct scientific research is to develop science. As long as a person studies diligently and achieves a certain achievement in academics, it is possible to obtain a certain degree. However, if obtaining a degree is regarded as the purpose of scientific research, and the diligent study of academics is neglected, and even scientific research is divorced from the needs of national construction and the interests of the people's cause, then it is completely contrary to our original intention of conducting scientific research. The ultimate goal of scientific research is to serve socialism and the people. The state should give appropriate opportunities to all young people who have the conditions to study science; if their current jobs do hinder them from making greater contributions to the country, the relevant authorities should also make the most appropriate arrangements as much as possible according to the specific circumstances. But if their work really cannot be transferred, or cannot be transferred within a period of time, then they should still first do their job well in their own position, and engage in scientific research within their own business scope or in their spare time. Some young people have grasped their personal studies very tightly, but have wrongly adopted a perfunctory attitude towards the work assigned to them by the state, which is not right.

Advancing towards science is the glorious task of the youth, and it is also the common responsibility of the Party, state organs, the Communist Youth League, and all relevant parties. At present, there are nearly three million young intellectuals in our country, of which more than 900,000 are young intellectuals with the equivalent of a university, junior college, or secondary vocational school education. This group of young intellectuals is a new generation in China's intellectual circles. They have a high degree of enthusiasm for advancing towards science, but the leadership work in many places is not yet able to adapt to this enthusiasm, and this situation must be changed quickly. We should not only guide the youth to determine the direction of their advance towards science, so that the enthusiasm of the youth to advance towards science is closely combined with the needs of the country, but also create the necessary conditions for young intellectuals. We should pay attention to reducing their excessive meetings and part-time jobs, and ensure their due study time; establish correspondence schools and night universities for them; and add necessary books, materials, and laboratories for them. In addition, we must constantly care about the improvement of their professional and ideological levels, actively organize young people to learn from old experts, and actively organize old experts to educate young people, so as to establish a close cooperative relationship between new and old experts. The state has opened up infinitely broad paths for the development of science, and the youth have a strong enthusiasm for advancing towards science. As long as we guide them correctly, a strong contingent of intellectuals will surely grow and develop rapidly, and promote the rapid advancement of the national construction cause.

### 向科学进军的正确道路

　　向科学进军的正确道路
    从五四运动提出“科学”和“民主”的口号以来，已经有三十七年了。在这三十七年间，中国的情况有了极其巨大的变化。当年提出的民主口号，已经彻底实现；而发展科学的任务，也已经有了比当年远为顺利的条件和远为实际的意义。
    继承着五四运动的光荣传统的我国青年，目前正在掀起一个向科学进军的热潮。他们纷纷制定个人的进修计划，组织业余的科学研究小组和进行业余自修。他们渴望能够掌握先进的科学技术，成为具有高度的文化水平的建设人才；并且和前辈们同心协力，争取在不太久的时间内，使我国最急需的科学部门接近世界的先进水平。我国青年一代向科学进军的这种热情是极可宝贵的。必须十分珍贵青年们的这种热情，并且帮助他们确定向科学进军的方向。
    向科学进军，必须具有顽强的精神和科学的态度，树立起实事求是、刻苦钻研、大胆发现科学真理的良好学风。科学无捷径，世界上所有的科学大师所以能够对人类作出光辉的贡献，都是因为他们作了长期的、艰苦的努力，经受得起无数次的挫折和失败。因此，今天在向科学进军道路上大踏步前进的我国青年，也必须有战胜一切困难的勇气，要有长期进行研究的决心，准备为科学贡献出毕生的精力。青年应当虚心地向自己的前辈和一切有经验的人学习，永远不能自满和骄傲。科学是无止境的，青年们不能仅仅以继承前人的遗产为满足，应当积极努力，把科学事业推向新的高峰，学会独立地解决国家建设中的各种复杂问题，用自己的创造性的劳动成果去丰富世界知识的宝库。要在科学工作中得到成就，必须依靠独立思考，不能人云亦云，依样画葫芦。要争取别人的指导，但是不能有丝毫的依赖心理；学习别人的长处，但是不能为别人的经验所束缚。这样，才能放开脚步前进。
    向科学进军必须从自己现有的水平出发，从精通本行业务做起。有的青年认为向科学进军，仅仅是从事学术研究工作，这种认识是不完全的。向科学进军的范围极其广阔，既包含学术研究，也包含掌握业务技术和提高文化知识水平。文化水平低的应当首先提高文化水平；业务生疏的应当先熟悉业务；科学基础知识缺乏的应当加强科学基础方面的学习；在科学研究上具有独立工作能力的，可以专攻自己的专业。总之，必须循序渐进，刻苦钻研，不能好高鹜远，只想一步登天。所谓从精通本行业务做起，就是要按照国家建设的需要，把进修和工作结合起来。因为每门业务都有科学理论问题，而科学的成就又不能离开对实际知识的了解。在我们的社会里，学与用基本上是一致的；每个青年所担负的工作都是国家所需要的。除了少数对自己的岗位工作已经完全胜任，并且有余力学习另一种技能的人以外，一般都应当在现有岗位上努力学习，争取把自己变成内行，成为本门业务的专家，而不应当轻率地丢掉这一行去干那一行。因此，应当坚持业余进修的方针，而不应当把进修和工作对立起来。
    有的青年认为向科学进军仅仅是要在若干年内取得一定的学位。当然，一个人能够取得一定的学位是个很大的荣誉，国家也正在准备实行学位、学衔等荣誉制度。但是获得学衔、学位只是表示一个人在科学的道路上所达到的成就，并不是科学研究本身的目的。我们所以要进行科学研究，乃是为了发展科学。一个人只要刻苦钻研，在学术上达到了一定的成就，就有可能得到一定的学位。但是，如果把取得学位当作了科学研究的目的，忽略了对学术的刻苦钻研，甚至使科学研究脱离国家建设的需要，脱离人民事业的利益，那就同我们进行科学研究的本意完全违背了。科学研究的最终目的是为社会主义、为人民服务。凡是有条件钻研科学的青年，国家都应该给他们以适当的机会；如果他们现有的工作岗位确实妨碍他们对国家作更大的贡献，有关的机关也应该根据具体情况，尽量作最妥善的处置。但是如果他们的工作确实不能调动，或者在一个时期内不能调动，那么，他们就仍然应该首先在自己的岗位上作好自己的工作，在自己的业务范围内或者在业余时间内从事科学研究。有些青年对个人的进修虽然抓得很紧，而对国家所分配给他的工作却错误地采取了应付的态度，这是不对的。
    向科学进军是青年的光荣任务，也是党、国家机关、青年团和各个有关方面的共同责任。目前我国有近三百万个青年知识分子，其中相当于大学、专科学校和中等专业学校毕业水平的青年知识分子约有九十多万人。这批青年知识分子是我国知识界新的一代，他们向科学进军的积极性很高，但是，许多地方的领导工作却还不能适应这种积极性，这种情况必须迅速改变。我们不仅应当引导青年确定向科学进军的方向，使青年向科学进军的积极性和国家的需要密切结合起来，而且要为青年知识分子创造必要的条件。应当注意减少他们过多的会议和兼职，保证他们应有的进修时间；给他们建立函授学校、夜大学；为他们添设必要的图书、资料、实验室。此外，要不断地关心他们的业务水平和思想水平的提高，积极地组织青年向老专家学习，又要积极地组织老专家教育青年，使新老专家之间建立起亲密合作的关系。国家为科学事业的发展开辟了无限广阔的道路，青年又有着向科学进军的旺盛的热情。只要我们正确地加以引导，一支强大的知识分子的队伍，就一定会很快地生长壮大起来，推动国家建设事业迅速前进。
