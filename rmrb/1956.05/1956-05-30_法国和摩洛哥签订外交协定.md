Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 29th: France and Morocco signed a diplomatic agreement in Paris on May 28th. This is one of the results of negotiations on the relationship between the two countries following France's recognition of Morocco's independence. In this agreement, France recognizes Morocco's diplomatic rights, and the agreement stipulates a relationship of "mutual dependence" in diplomacy between the two countries.

The agreement stipulates that the two countries should coordinate their diplomatic policies, consult frequently, and prohibit either country from adopting policies that contradict the interests of the other. France will support Morocco's accession to the United Nations, and the activities of the two countries' representatives in international organizations will be coordinated. France will continue to represent Morocco's interests in countries where Morocco does not have diplomatic missions.

In the agreement, Morocco recognizes treaties previously signed by France in Morocco's name, with the exception of the treaty on the establishment of air force bases by the United States on Moroccan territory. In a letter to the French Deputy Foreign Minister, Moroccan Foreign Minister Balafrej said that the Moroccan government will decide its attitude towards this treaty on its own.

    法国和摩洛哥签订外交协定
    新华社29日讯　巴黎消息：法国—摩洛哥外交协定五月二十八日在巴黎签字。这是在法国承认摩洛哥独立以后，举行关于两国关系问题谈判的结果之一。在这个协定里法国承认摩洛哥有外交权，同时协定规定了两国在外交上“互相依赖”的关系。
    协定规定，两国在外交政策上要协调一致，要经常进行协商，禁止两国中任何一国采取同另一国利益矛盾的政策。法国将支持摩洛哥加入联合国，两国代表在国际组织中的活动将配合一致。法国继续在摩洛哥不设有外交使节的国家里代表摩洛哥的利益。
    摩洛哥在协定中承认以前由法国用摩洛哥名义签订的条约，关于美国在摩洛哥领土上建立空军基地的条约是例外。摩洛哥外交大臣贝拉弗里杰在给法国外交次长的信里说：摩洛哥政府将自行决定对这个条约的态度。
