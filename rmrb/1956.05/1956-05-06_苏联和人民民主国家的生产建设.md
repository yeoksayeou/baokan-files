　　Production and Construction in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
　　Soviet Union Fully Launches Spring Afforestation Work
　　In the steppe regions of the Soviet Union, such as Ukraine, the North Caucasus, the Don River, and the Volga River basin, spring afforestation work is now being fully launched. This year, ten billion poplar, larch, and birch trees will be planted in fields, near valleys, and on sandy land in these areas. The appearance of the grassland is changing year by year.
　　The total forest area of the Soviet Union accounts for about one-third of the world's forest area. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the area of new forests planted and naturally renewed in the Soviet Union was more than 5,174,000 hectares, which is larger than the area of Switzerland plus four Luxembourgs.
　　During the new Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union plans to plant another 2,995,900 hectares of new forests and carry out natural regeneration work in approximately 3,817,000 hectares of existing forests.
　　In order to meet the needs of afforestation work for saplings, nurseries across the Soviet Union will cultivate six billion saplings in the next few years. In the newly created forests, in addition to planting valuable and fast-growing trees such as pine, birch, fir, oak, and poplar, 100 million fruit trees such as apples, pears, apricots, and walnuts will also be planted every year.
　　Korea is Widely Building Irrigation Projects
　　The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is widely building irrigation projects. In 1956, the area of ​​irrigated farmland will increase by 100% compared with 1945. For this purpose, 245 irrigation projects are currently under construction, including 20 million cubic meters of earthwork and 310,000 cubic meters of cement work.
　　The second phase of Korea's largest water conservancy and irrigation project, built in South Pyongan Province, is nearing completion. This irrigation project will irrigate the fertile land along the Yellow Sea coast. After the completion of the two phases of the irrigation project, the irrigated farmland area will increase by 30,000 cho (1 cho equals 0.99 hectares).
　　The Sungho irrigation project in South Pyongan Province, which will be completed soon, will be able to irrigate 3,500 cho of farmland.
　　In addition, agricultural producers' cooperatives and individual farmers are also building small-scale irrigation canals and dikes across the country.
　　Czechoslovak Agricultural Workers Vigorously Carry Out Spring Plowing
　　Despite the rare cold snap in Europe this year, Czechoslovak farmers have begun intensive spring plowing, laying the foundation for this year's bumper harvest.
　　At present, most areas in the south and central regions have completed their grain sowing plans, and in many places, unified agricultural cooperatives have even overfulfilled their grain sowing plans.
　　Due to the cold snap, the weather in Czechoslovakia this year has been cold for a long time, and it has been raining continuously. The snow in many places has been slow to melt, and the dry land is also very muddy, which has delayed the spring plowing work for a long time. However, as soon as the weather recently turned fine, the farmers carried out spring plowing day and night.
　　In 1955, Czechoslovak agricultural workers overcame similar difficulties, achieved the goal of increasing total agricultural output, and increased the yield per unit area by 11.5%. Among them, wheat increased by about one-third. The yield per unit area of ​​wheat in unified agricultural cooperatives increased by 12% compared with individual farmers.
　　Bulgaria Overfulfills First Quarter Production Plan
　　The Central Statistical Bureau of the Council of Ministers of Bulgaria published a communique on April 27 on the results of the implementation of the national economic development plan for the first quarter of this year.
　　The communique said that the industrial production plan for the first quarter of this year was fulfilled by 102%, and the total output increased by 13% compared with the same period last year. Among them, electricity increased by 19%, coal increased by 12%, steel increased by 47%, and woolen fabrics increased by 17%.
　　In terms of agriculture, 282,000 farm households have joined agricultural producers' cooperatives since the beginning of this year. At present, about 77% of farm households and more than 75% of cultivated land in the country have been cooperativized. Since the beginning of this year, more than 1,800 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 140 grain harvesting combines and many other agricultural machines have been added to agricultural production.
　　In the first quarter of this year, the domestic commodity turnover (calculated at comparable prices) increased by 15% compared with the same period last year. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　苏联和人民民主国家的生产建设
    苏联春季造林工作全面展开
    在苏联的乌克兰、北高加索、顿河和伏尔加河流域等草原地区，现在正在全面展开春季造林工作。今年在这些地区的田野、峡谷附近和沙地上将种植十亿株白杨、落叶松、桦树。草原的面貌是一年不同一年了。
    苏联森林的总面积约占全世界森林面积的三分之一。在第五个五年计划期间苏联植造的新森林和进行自然更新的森林面积有五百一十七万四千多公顷，比一个瑞士加上四个卢森堡的面积还要大。
    在新五年计划期间，苏联计划将再植造二百九十九万五千九百多公顷新森林，并且在约三百八十一万七千公顷原有森林中进行自然更新工作。
    为了满足造林工作对树苗的需要，今后几年内，苏联各地苗圃将培植六十亿棵树苗。在新造的森林中，除了种植松树、桦树、枞树、橡树、白杨等有价值而且成长快的树木以外，每年还将种植一亿棵苹果、梨、杏、胡桃等果树。
    朝鲜正在广泛兴建灌溉工程
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国正在广泛兴建灌溉工程。在1956年，受到灌溉的农田面积将比1945年增加100％。为了这个目的，现在正在兴建二百四十五项灌溉工程，这些工程包括二千万立方公尺的土方工程和三十一万立方公尺的水泥工程。
    在平安南道兴建的朝鲜最大的水利灌溉工程的第二阶段工程将近完成，这个灌溉工程将灌溉黄海沿岸肥沃的土地。这个灌溉工程的两个阶段的工程完成后，将使受到灌溉的农田面积增加三万町步（一町步等于零点九九公顷）。
    不久就可完工的平安南道胜湖灌溉工程将能够灌溉三千五百町步的农田。
    除此以外，农业生产合作社和个体农民也正在全国各地兴建小型的灌溉水渠和水堤。
    捷农业劳动者紧张进行春耕
    尽管欧洲今年遭到了罕见的严寒的侵袭，捷克斯洛伐克农民们已经开始了紧张的春耕，为今年的丰产打下了基础。
    目前，南部和中部的大部分地区已经完成了谷物播种计划，有许多地方的统一农业合作社还超额完成了谷物播种计划。
    由于寒潮侵袭，捷克斯洛伐克今年天气冷的时间很长，而且阴雨连绵，许多地方的积雪迟迟不化，旱地也十分泥泞，从而使春耕工作推迟了很久。但是，当最近天气刚一好转，农民们就夜以继日地进行春耕。
    1955年，捷克斯洛伐克农业劳动者曾经克服过类似的困难，达到了增加农业总产量的目标，把单位面积产量提高了11.5％。其中小麦增加了约三分之一。统一农业合作社的小麦的单位面积产量比个体农民提高了12％。
　　保超额完成第一季度生产计划
    保加利亚部长会议所属中央统计局，四月二十七日发表了今年第一季度发展国民经济国家计划执行结果的公报。
    公报说，今年第一季度的工业生产计划完成了102％，总产量比去年同期增加了13％。其中电力增加了19％，煤增加了12％，钢增加了47％，毛织品增加了17％。
    在农业方面，从今年年初以来已经有二十八万二千农户参加了农业生产合作社。现在，全国约有77％的农户和75％以上的耕地已经合作化了。今年以来，农业生产中还增添了一千八百多台拖拉机（每台按十五匹马力计算）、一百四十台谷物收获联合机和许多其他农业机器。
    在今年第一季度，国内商品流转额（按比较价格计算）比去年同期增加了15％。　（据新华社讯）
