Youth League Member Zhang Wanzeng Leads the Masses in Doing a Good Job in Soil and Water Conservation
Liu Hanying

Secaowan Village is located halfway up a mountain in Qingyun District, Yulin County. Among the village's two thousand mu of cultivated land, sixteen hundred mu are sloping fields, and there are also four hundred mu of irrigable paddy fields. Logically, with so much land, the lives of the villagers should be very good. However, due to the lack of soil and water conservation work, the village suffers from floods of varying degrees every year, and the lives of the farmers are very poor. Since the spring of 1955, when the Party branch led the villagers in carrying out soil and water conservation work, this situation has begun to change. Last year, the paddy fields were not flooded; the crops in the terraced fields also had higher yields than ordinary land by 20% to 30% due to soil and water conservation.

Speaking of the village's soil and water conservation work, people cannot help but think of Youth League member Zhang Wanzeng.

In the spring of 1955, after the soil and water conservation work team arrived in the village, many people simply did not believe that soil and water conservation could prevent disasters, and some people even thought it was "wanting to fly without wings." But Zhang Wanzeng did not think so. Although he did not thoroughly understand the principle that soil and water conservation could prevent flood disasters, he actively supported soil and water conservation work.

On the one hand, he actively publicized the benefits of building terraced fields to the masses, and on the other hand, he discussed with the Youth League branch secretary and the cooperative director to have the cooperative set an example. At the same time, he also asked comrades from the work team to introduce the methods of building terraced fields. In this way, he finally mobilized a part of the masses to participate in the construction of terraced fields, and they were successfully built. On the first day, their techniques were not very skilled, and each person only built fifteen meters per day. Comrade Zhang Wanzeng constantly explained the techniques and experience to everyone, and the next day it was increased to eighteen meters. Zhang Wanzeng's group averaged twenty-two meters per person per day. In this way, forty people built twenty-four mu of terraced fields in three days. When it was necessary to build earth dams, the masses were unwilling to do it again because the first large dam was built with state funds, and they believed that these small dams should also be built by the state. After being educated by the Party branch, Zhang Wanzeng realized that this idea of simply relying on the government was wrong. The Youth League branch secretary and Zhang Wanzeng studied together, and in order to motivate the masses, they first mobilized the youth to contract to build the first small dam. This proposal was immediately responded to by the youth. The Youth League branch decided to have the eighteen youths who volunteered contract to build the first small earth dam, five meters high, five meters wide, and eight meters long.

Zhang Wanzeng played a significant role in promoting the process of contracting to build this earth dam. He always did the heaviest work. When Qiao Ying was tired from pushing the soil, he would take over and push. When Xu Zixiang was out of strength from tamping, he would take over and tamp. The small dam, which was originally scheduled to be completed in three days, was completed in two days. The Party branch and the Youth League branch widely publicized the deeds of the youths among the masses and the youth, which mobilized the broad masses to participate in the dam construction project.

Although the terraced fields were built, protecting the terraced fields from being washed away by floods was still an important task. One day in July, it started to rain heavily. At that time, Zhang Wanzeng was working at home when he suddenly heard someone shouting, "The terraced fields are about to be washed away!" Hearing this, Zhang Wanzeng, regardless of how heavy the rain was, took an iron shovel, called some young people along the way, and ran up the mountain in one breath.

When they arrived there, the cooperative's twenty-four mu of terraced fields were full of water, and the uppermost one had been breached by a mountain torrent. If this breach was not blocked immediately, there was a risk that all twenty-four mu of terraced fields would be washed away. Zhang Wanzeng jumped into the water without hesitation and used his body to block the breach. After the breach was blocked, they quickly climbed to the top of the mountain and dug two drainage ditches on both sides of the terraced fields, thus preserving the twenty-four mu of terraced fields.

In this way, they realized that protecting terraced fields was more important than building them. Zhang Wanzeng united with several other young people to form an inspection and protection team. No matter how heavy the rain was, they would go up the mountain to inspect and protect the terraced fields. Last year, after they studied the Party's plan for fundamentally controlling the Yellow River and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League's decision to convene a youth afforestation conference in five provinces (regions), they knew that relying solely on human inspection was not a fundamental solution. Therefore, last winter, Zhang Wanzeng actively led the villagers to launch a tree planting and afforestation campaign, planting more than 10,000 trees on the hillside and more than 120 mu of caragana on the upper slopes of the terraced fields.

Under the influence of Secaowan Village, the masses in nearby villages such as Yanjiagou and Zhujiagou also started soil and water conservation work last winter. Youth League member Zhang Wanzeng, who played an active leading role in this work, received material rewards from the County People's Committee, a certificate of merit from the County Committee of the Communist Youth League, and participated in the Five-Province Youth Afforestation Conference.

　　带领群众做好水土保持工作的青年团员张万增
　　刘汉英
    色草湾村在榆林县青云区的半山腰。全村两千亩耕地中，有一千六百亩是坡地，还有四百亩可以灌溉的水田。按理，有这么多的土地，全村农民的生活应该是很好的。可是由于没有进行水土保持工作，这个村年年都要遭受程度不等的洪水的灾害，农民的生活非常贫困。从1955年春天起，党支部领导这个村的群众进行水土保持工作以后，这种情况开始有了转变。去年稻田没有被淹没；梯田里的庄稼，也由于保持了水土，产量比一般土地提高二、三成。
    提起这个村子的水土保持工作，人们就不能不想起青年团员张万增来。
    1955年春天，水土保持工作组到村里后，许多人根本不相信进行水土保持工作就能免除灾害，有的群众甚至认为这是“没长翅膀想上天”。而张万增却不这样想，虽然他还不透彻了解水土保持可以免除洪水灾害的道理，可是他却积极拥护进行水土保持工作。
    他一面积极地向群众宣传修梯田的好处，一面就同团支部书记和社主任商量，由合作社先作个样子；同时又请工作组同志介绍了修梯田的方法。这样，终于动员了一部分群众参加了修梯田工作，而且修成功了。第一天他们技术还不太熟练，每人每天只修十五公尺，张万增同志不断地把技术和经验讲给大家，第二天就提高到十八公尺。张万增领导的小组每人每天平均修到二十二公尺。这样，四十个人三天即修梯田二十四亩。到需要打土坝的时候，群众又不愿干了，原因是第一个大坝是国家出钱修的，他们认为这些小坝也应该由国家来修。张万增经过党支部的教育，认识到这种单纯依靠政府的想法是不对的。团支部书记又同张万增一起研究，为了带动群众，首先动员青年来包修第一个小坝。这一提议立即得到青年的响应。团分支就决定由自愿报名的十八个青年包修第一个五公尺高、五公尺宽、八公尺长的小土坝。
    张万增在包修这个土坝的过程中又起了不小的推动作用。他总是捡最重的活做，乔英推土推累了，他就换着去推，许子祥打夯没劲了，他就接上去打。原定三天修成的小坝，两天完工了。党支部和团分支又在群众中和青年中广泛地宣传了青年们的这一事迹，就动员了广大群众参加打坝的工程。
    梯田虽然修成了，可是保护梯田不被洪水冲垮还是一个重要任务。七月里的一天，下起了猛雨。当时，张万增正在家中作活，猛然听到有人喊：“梯田快冲垮了。”张万增听了，不管雨下得多大，就拿一把铁铣，顺路招呼了一些青年，一口气向山上跑去。
    到了那里，社里二十四亩梯田都聚满了水，最上边的那块，已被山洪冲开了一个水洞。如果不马上堵住这个水洞，二十四亩梯田即有全部被冲垮的危险。张万增就毫不犹豫地跳到水里，用自己的身子堵住决口。等到决口堵好了他们又很快地爬到山上，在梯田的两旁挖开了两个水沟，就这样保住了二十四亩梯田。
    这样，他们认识到：护梯田比修梯田更重要，张万增就团结了其他几个青年组成了一个检查护田组，再大的雨，他们都要上山检查和保护梯田。去年他们学习了党的根治黄河的计划和团中央召开五省（区）青年造林大会的决定后，知道光凭人检查，不是治本的办法。因此，张万增去冬又积极领导全村群众展开植树造林运动，在山坡种树一万多株，在梯田上坡种了一百二十多亩柠条。
    在色草湾村的影响下，附近的阎家沟、朱家沟等村的群众，也在去冬开始了水土保持工作。在这一工作中起了积极带头作用的青年团员张万增，受到了县人民委员会的物质奖励，得到了青年团县委的奖状，并且参加了五省青年造林大会。
