Using Airplanes to Spray Powder to Treat Wheat Midges

　　A green biplane is flying over the Xinxiang and Huixian areas of Henan Province. This is the airplane that the Ministry of Agriculture sent to the farmers to treat wheat midges. As of the 5th, this airplane has sprayed powder twice over more than 52,000 mu of wheat fields.

　　These days are the peak period for wheat midges to emerge from the soil. Using airplanes to concentrate on killing wheat midges is very effective. According to inspections in the sprayed wheat fields, more than 99% of the wheat midges are dead.

　　This is China's first time using airplanes to prevent and control wheat midges. More than 200 agricultural work cadres from Heilongjiang, Anhui and other eight provinces and directors of local agricultural production cooperatives visited and studied this airplane pest control work.

　　用飞机喷撒药粉治小麦吸浆虫
    一架绿色双翼飞机，在河南省新乡、辉县一带上空飞翔着。这是农业部给农民派来治小麦吸浆虫的飞机。这架飞机到五日为止，已经在五万二千多亩小麦田上喷撒了两次药粉。
    这几天，正是小麦吸浆虫出土最多的时候。用飞机集中杀吸浆虫，效果很大。据在撒过药的麦田里检查，吸浆虫死了99％以上。
    这是中国第一次用飞机防治吸浆虫。黑龙江、安徽等八个省的农业工作干部和当地农业生产合作社社长二百多人都参观和学习了这次的飞机治虫的工作。  （据新华社讯）
