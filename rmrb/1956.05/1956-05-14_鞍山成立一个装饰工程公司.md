    Anshan Establishes a Decoration Engineering Company
    The Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company recently established a decoration engineering company. This is a construction team specializing in decoration work for industrial buildings. Its establishment will create favorable conditions for improving the mechanization level of decoration work.
    Last year, the mechanization level of decoration work in the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company was very low, with mechanical operation accounting for only 8% of the total workload. This year, it is required to reach 50%. Currently, the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company is collecting a large number of decoration machines from its affiliated companies, such as spraying machines, plastering machines, and painting machines. Anshan's construction organization is further moving towards specialization. (Feng Shiming)

    鞍山成立一个装饰工程公司
    鞍山钢铁建设公司最近成立了一个装饰工程公司。这是一支专门担负工业建筑中装饰工作的建设队伍。它的成立将为提高装饰工作机械化水平创造有利条件。
    去年鞍钢建设公司装饰工作机械化水平很低，机械操作仅达总工作量的8％，今年要求达到50％。现在，鞍钢建设公司正从所属各公司调集大批装饰机械，如喷浆机、粉刷机、刷油机等。鞍山建筑施工组织正在进一步向专业化迈进。　（冯世明）
