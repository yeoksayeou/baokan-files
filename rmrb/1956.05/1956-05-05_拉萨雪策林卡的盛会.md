This dispatch from our newspaper in Lhasa on the 4th reports: Today, over three thousand Tibetan and Han youths from Lhasa City came to Xuelinqia Linka, below the Potala Palace, to hold a garden party together with youths from a dozen fraternal ethnic groups of the Central Delegation.

　　Early summer in Linka is a lush green. Many tents of all sizes have been set up in the poplar groves. In the largest flower tent, hundreds of young men and women are happily dancing. On the sports ground, basketball and volleyball matches are in progress. In the variety show area, people are guessing lantern riddles, tossing rings, lighting Tibetan incense, and throwing balls... The shooting range, with target practice, attracts even more people, and the performances of young PLA officers and soldiers are praised by the audience.

　　Almost every lawn in Linka is occupied by joyful young people. Sitting together in circles are Tibetan young men and women from Lhasa, Han and Tibetan workers, PLA soldiers, lamas, and also young people from the Central Delegation. Zhang Jingwu, Deputy Head of the Central Delegation, Luo Yi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and some older Tibetan officials also came to participate in the youth festival today. When the accordion starts playing, young people dance Tibetan dances together. After a allegro is recited, a excerpt of Tibetan opera is sung a cappella. The amateur song and dance troupe of the Lhasa Patriotic Youth Cultural Association performed the famous Tibetan opera "Sugy Nyima." Guli (Uyghur nationality) and Fang Chushan (Korean nationality), young dancers from the Central National Song and Dance Troupe, also performed wonderful dance programs for their Tibetan friends in Lhasa.

　　Here, Tibetan and Han youths are giving each other souvenirs. Those who knew each other in the past hug and hug again; those who did not know each other become close friends from today. Meng Sufen, a Buyi female member of the Central Delegation, and Kelsang Lhundrub, a Tibetan youth, once attended the World Youth Festival in Warsaw together, and today they met again happily. Yao Xi Zeren Zhuoma, the Dalai Lama's sister, and Ulan, a Mongolian female member of the Central Delegation, also played ball and danced intimately together. Those working in Tibet introduce the rich and lovely situation of Tibet to their friends who have just come from Beijing; the people of the Central Delegation are also invited to report on the socialist construction in the interior of the motherland.

　　拉萨雪策林卡的盛会
    本报拉萨4日电　今天，拉萨市三千多藏族、汉族青年，来到了布达拉宫下的雪策林卡，同中央代表团十几个兄弟民族的青年一起举行游园大会。
    初夏的林卡，一片浓绿。白杨树丛里，搭起了许多大大小小的帐篷。最大的花帐篷里，有几百对男女青年在欢乐地跳着舞。运动场上，篮排球的比赛正在进行。杂耍场里在猜灯谜、丢圈、点藏香、投球……。射击场的打靶，吸引了更多的人，解放军青年军官和青年战士的表演，受到了观众的赞扬。
    林卡里的每一片草坪，几乎都被欢乐的青年人占据了。围着圈儿坐在一起的，有拉萨的藏族青年男女，有藏汉族工人，有解放军战士，有喇嘛，也有中央代表团中的年轻人。中央代表团副团长张经武和中国新民主主义青年团中央书记处书记罗毅，还有一些年老的西藏官员，今天也都来参加青年人的盛会。手风琴响起来了，年轻人一起跳藏族舞。说完了快板，就来一曲藏戏清唱。拉萨市爱国青年文化联谊会的业余歌舞团，演出了著名藏戏“苏口尼玛”。中央民族歌舞团的青年舞蹈家古丽（维吾尔族）、方初善（朝鲜族），也为拉萨的藏族朋友表演了精采的舞蹈节目。
    在这里，藏族和汉族青年互相赠送着纪念品。过去相识的，拥抱了又拥抱；不相识的，从今天起成了亲密的友人。中央代表团布依族女团员蒙素芬和藏族青年噶雪·赖珠曾经一块儿出席过华沙的世界青年联欢节，今天他们又愉快地见面了。达赖喇嘛的姐姐尧西·泽仁卓玛和中央代表团蒙古族女团员乌兰，也亲热地在一起打球、跳舞。那些在西藏工作的人，向刚从北京来的朋友介绍西藏富饶可爱的情况；中央代表团的人，也被邀请报告祖国内地社会主义建设的情景。
