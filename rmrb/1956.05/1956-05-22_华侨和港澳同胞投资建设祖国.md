Overseas Chinese and Compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao Invest in the Construction of the Motherland
    Wu Erxiang

    In Guangdong Province, the number of factories and enterprises built with investments from overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao has been increasing in recent years. Many overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao consider it a great honor to be able to contribute a little to the socialist construction of the motherland.

    There are six million overseas Chinese whose ancestral home is in Guangdong, seven million relatives of overseas Chinese, and a considerable number of compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao whose ancestral home is also Guangdong. Many overseas Chinese were forced to leave their beloved hometowns and go abroad in the past due to oppression and exploitation by bureaucratic landlords. However, overseas, they also endured discrimination and oppression from imperialists for a long time due to the weakness of the motherland at that time. How much they hoped to have a strong, independent, and free motherland! But in the era of reactionary rule, their patriotic enthusiasm was not only unprotected by the reactionary government but instead became the target of fraud and extortion by reactionary bureaucratic landlords. A significant portion of the money they sent back was swallowed up by bureaucratic landlords; their investments in the country mostly failed.

    Now, their hopes have been realized: the motherland is already an independent and free country, and its international status is rising day by day. Many overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao return to the motherland in batches to visit. Seeing the great achievements of the motherland's construction, their patriotic enthusiasm has become even higher, and they are more actively demanding to contribute their strength to the construction of the motherland.

    Some time ago, I visited an overseas Chinese who had just returned from abroad. This overseas Chinese had spent thirty years abroad. He told me that he used to return to China every few years to take a look, but each time he returned with great hope and left heartbroken. In 1947, he returned once and spent 150,000 Hong Kong dollars to open a gold shop in Guangzhou, but in less than a month, two bandits came and robbed the gold jewelry, and one of his nephews was beaten to death. After this setback, coupled with the devaluation of the Kuomintang currency, the 150,000 yuan investment was wiped out in less than a year. That time he returned to China, he also went back to his hometown. As soon as he arrived home, he received an anonymous letter asking him to hand over 24 taels of gold, or he would lose his life... He secretly left his hometown that night. "At that time," he said sadly, "it was impossible to find a place to settle down!" But this time he returned, he saw the motherland undergoing socialist construction, with stable social order, stable prices, and everyone living in harmony. He said with emotion: "This is truly like two different worlds compared to the past." He invested 250,000 yuan in the Overseas Chinese Investment Company. According to the articles of association of the Overseas Chinese Investment Company, he can receive 20,000 yuan in dividends every year, which is enough for his family's living expenses. He said, "Before liberation, we had no opportunity to serve the motherland. Now that we have this opportunity, we must strive for more investment."

    In order to facilitate overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao to invest in the country and guide them to participate in the construction of the motherland according to the national plan and the needs of the people, the state, starting in 1951, jointly invested with overseas Chinese to form three relatively large joint state-private enterprises: the South China Enterprise Company, the Overseas Chinese Industrial Construction Company, and the Guangzhou Investment Company. By the end of 1954, these three companies had successively built five factories, including the Huajian Jute Textile Factory and the Xuwen Huajian Sugar Factory; at the same time, they also cooperated with state-owned commercial departments to carry out foreign trade business. However, with the development of the motherland's construction, more and more overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao are demanding to invest in the country. The above three companies, due to their decentralized and repetitive operations, have been unable to adapt to the requirements of the current situation. Therefore, in early 1955, the above three companies were reorganized and merged into one Overseas Chinese Investment Company. Since then, a unified organization for guiding overseas Chinese investment has emerged in Guangdong.

    Recently, I visited the Overseas Chinese Investment Company. The person in charge of the company said excitedly: In the past year, thanks to the great achievements of the motherland's construction and the improvement of its international status, as well as the earnest implementation of the policy of preferential treatment for overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao, the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao to invest in the construction of the motherland has been greatly encouraged. More people are investing than in any previous year, and the company's business is thriving.

    From its establishment in March last year to the end of last year, the Overseas Chinese Investment Company increased its capital by more than 5.4 million yuan in ten months. Using this overseas Chinese investment, in addition to expanding and renovating the original factories, they also built a Qingyuan Huajian Sugar Factory with a daily sugarcane crushing capacity of 300 tons and four rosin factories. According to the statistics of ten factories, the total output value in 1955 reached more than 17 million yuan, an increase of 43.4% compared to 1954. The turnover of foreign trade in 1955 increased by 5.76 times compared to 1954.

    With the advent of the high tide of socialist construction in the motherland, they will play a greater role in the construction of the motherland. According to their plan for 1956, both the total industrial output value and the foreign trade business will increase by about one time compared to 1955. Now, the construction of a sugar factory with a daily sugarcane crushing capacity of 2,000 tons has already begun; the construction of a ramie textile factory with 20,000 spindles is also being actively prepared. They plan to invest a total of 37 million yuan in these two factories, and it is expected that they can be put into production next year. In addition, they also plan to reclaim wasteland on Hainan Island and operate subtropical plants. The constantly growing needs of the people of the motherland have opened up an infinitely broad road for overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao to invest in the country.

    In order to take care of the special circumstances of overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao, the government has stipulated a policy of preferential treatment for their investment. According to this policy, all the shares of overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao invested in the Overseas Chinese Investment Company in foreign exchange after liberation will still be treated as personal shares when socialism is built, retaining their private ownership, and guaranteeing that overseas Chinese investment will pay dividends at an annual interest rate of eight percent. The government has also clearly announced that overseas Chinese will not change their original class composition due to their investment relationship. These all demonstrate the government's care and consideration for overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese are therefore greatly encouraged.

    The state gives strong support to the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao who return to invest and actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. For example, the Huajian Jute Textile Factory is a relatively large factory of the Overseas Chinese Investment Company. From the selection of the factory site, the purchase of machinery, to the training of personnel, all were solved with the help of the government. Because it is established and produced according to the national plan and the needs of the people, the state guarantees the supply of raw materials, and the state is responsible for selling the produced products; even if the national production of jute is insufficient, they can obtain the necessary raw materials and will not reduce production due to insufficient raw materials. At the same time, the operation and management of the factory are carried out according to the principles of socialist operation and management. There is no contradiction between labor and capital as in capitalist enterprises. They only have one common desire: to produce more and better sacks to support national construction. In 1955, due to the workers' improvement of the degumming rate of jute and the reduction of waste silk in the weaving process, the raw materials saved in one year can increase the production of 170,000 sacks, and the cost is also reduced by 10.5%. Such a factory will of course continue to develop. This factory was put into production in August 1953, and only produced 250,000 sacks by the end of the year, but the annual output reached more than 2.76 million sacks in the second year, and it increased to more than 2.9 million sacks last year. This year, it plans to produce 4.6 million sacks. It only opened one shift at the beginning, but after 1954, it changed to two shifts. This year, it is required to open three shifts. But this still cannot meet the needs of the country, so they are preparing to expand, requiring the production capacity to be increased to 9 million sacks per year. When it was first put into production in 1953, there were many difficulties, but it was neither profitable nor loss-making; in 1954, it made a profit of 1.36 million yuan, and in 1955, it increased to 1.51 million yuan. It is estimated that it can make a profit of 3 million yuan this year.

    In the past few years, although the joint state-private South China Enterprise Company, Overseas Chinese Industrial Construction Company, and Guangzhou Investment Company have had more difficulties, they have made a total profit of more than 6 million yuan, of which 2 million yuan has been distributed to private shareholders as dividends and bonuses. The Overseas Chinese Investment Company has also made a profit of more than 3.4 million yuan in the past year, of which more than 1.1 million yuan has been distributed to private shareholders as dividends. Many overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao use this dividend as their children's education expenses; some overseas Chinese shareholders have children studying in the country, and they entrust the company to remit the dividend to their children on a monthly basis.

    The success of the Overseas Chinese Investment Company in its operations fully demonstrates that overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao investing in the construction of the motherland is not only beneficial to the country but also beneficial to themselves. Many overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and Macao industrialists and businessmen, under the threat of the capitalist economic crisis, hope to find the most secure way out for their funds. Where is the way out? A shareholder of the Overseas Chinese Investment Company answered this question definitively. He said: "I used to think abroad: Should I buy the stocks of foreign companies with my funds? But according to the current situation, we must estimate the recurrence of the depression of 1926; should I use them to buy gold? But watching the price of gold fall from more than 600 Hong Kong dollars per tael to more than 200 Hong Kong dollars... After thinking about it, I finally decided to invest back in the motherland. The motherland is thriving, and it treats overseas Chinese so favorably. Investing back in the country can be considered as contributing to the country's construction, and one's own funds are also guaranteed, and the lives of family members and children are secure. This is indeed the most reliable and promising way out."

    华侨和港澳同胞投资建设祖国
    吴尔祥
    在广东省由华侨和港澳同胞投资建成的工厂企业，这几年越来越多了。许多华侨和港澳同胞，都把能够在祖国的社会主义建设当中贡献一点力量引为莫大的光荣。
    广东籍的华侨有六百万，侨眷有七百万，还有为数不少的原籍广东的港澳同胞。许多华侨都是由于过去受官僚地主的压迫剥削，被迫离开了自己可爱的家乡而远走海外的。但是在海外，也由于当时祖国衰弱而长期忍受着帝国主义的歧视和压迫。他们是多么希望自己有一个强大独立自由的祖国啊！但是在反动统治的时代，他们的爱国热情不但受不到反动政府的保护，相反地成为反动官僚地主欺诈、勒索的对象。他们寄回来的钱，有不少给官僚地主所吞没；他们回国投资也大都失败。
    现在，他们的希望实现了：祖国已经是一个独立自由的国家，国际地位日益提高。许多华侨和港澳同胞成批地回到祖国参观，他们看到祖国建设的伟大成就，爱国热情越高了，也就更积极地要求在祖国的建设中贡献自己的力量。
    前些时候，我访问了一个刚从国外回来的侨胞。这位侨胞在国外度过了三十年。他对我说，他过去每过几年就要回国来看看，但是每一次都是抱着莫大的希望归来，而伤心地离去。1947年他回来过一次，花了十五万元港币在广州市开了一家金铺，但是没有一个月，来了两个土匪，金饰给抢走了，他的一个外甥被打死了。经过这次波折，加上国民党货币贬值，不到一年，这十五万元的投资就化为乌有。那一次回国，他还回了一趟故乡。他刚到家，就接到了一封匿名信，要他交出二十四两黄金，不然就要他的老命……他当夜就偷偷地离开了故乡。“在那个时候”他伤心地说：“你要想找一个安身立足的地方都不可能！”但是他这一次回来，看到了正在进行社会主义建设的祖国，社会秩序安定，物价平稳，人人相亲。他感动地说：
  “这比起过去，真是两个天地。”他在华侨投资公司投资二十五万元，按华侨投资公
  司章程规定，他每年可以拿到二万元的股息，足够他一家的生活费用。他说：“在解放前我们对祖国没有效力的机会，现在有了这个机会，要争取更多的投资。”
    国家为便利华侨和港澳同胞回国投资，引导他们根据国家计划和人民的需要参加祖国建设，从1951年开始，由国家和华侨共同投资，组成了华南企业公司、华侨工业建设公司和广州投资公司等三个规模比较大的公私合营企业。到1954年底，这三个公司先后共建成了华建麻纺厂、徐闻华建糖厂等五个工厂；同时还配合国营商业部门开展了对外贸易业务。但是，随着祖国建设事业的发展，华侨和港澳同胞要求回国投资的越来越多，以上三个公司由于经营上分散、重复，已经不能适应当前形势发展的要求，因此在1955年初，把以上三个公司经过改组合并成了一个华侨投资公司。从此在广东就出现了一个引导华侨投资的统一机构。
    最近我访问了华侨投资公司。公司负责人兴奋地对我说：一年来，由于祖国建设的伟大成就，国际地位的提高，同时由于认真贯彻执行了优待华侨和港澳同胞投资的政策，大大鼓舞了华侨和港澳同胞投资建设祖国的积极性，投资的人比过去任何一年都踊跃，公司业务也欣欣向荣。
    华侨投资公司自去年三月成立到去年底，十个月期间，股金增加了五百四十多万元。他们利用这笔华侨投资，除了扩建和改建原有的工厂外，还建造了一个日榨蔗三百吨的清远华建糖厂和四个松香厂。据十个工厂的统计，1955年的总产值达到了一千七百多万元，比1954年增加了43.4％。1955年对外贸易的营业额比1954年增长了五点七六倍。
    随着祖国社会主义建设高潮的到来，他们在祖国的建设事业中，还将发挥更大的作用。根据他们1956年的计划，不管工业总产值还是对外贸易业务，都将比1955年增加一倍左右。现在，已经开始施工建造一个日榨蔗二千吨的糖厂；一个二万锭子的苎麻纺织厂也正在积极准备建造中。这两个厂他们计划共投资三千七百万元，预计明年都可以投入生产。另外，他们还准备在海南岛上开垦荒地，经营亚热带植物。祖国人民需要的不断增长，为华侨和港澳同胞回国投资开辟了一条无限广阔的道路。
    为了照顾华侨和港澳同胞的特殊情况，政府规定了优待华侨和港澳同胞投资的政策。根据这个政策，凡华侨和港澳同胞于解放后以外汇投资于华侨投资公司的股金，到社会主义建成的时候，仍按个人股金处理，保留其私有权，并且保证华侨投资按年利八厘付股息，政府还明确宣布，华侨不因其投资关系而改变其原来的阶级成分。这些都表现了政府对华侨的关怀和照顾，华侨也因此受到极大的鼓舞。
    国家对华侨和港澳同胞回国投资积极参加祖国社会主义建设的热情，给予大力的支持。例如，华建麻纺厂是华侨投资公司的一个规模比较大的工厂。这个厂从厂址的选择、机器的购买，到人材的训练，都是在政府帮助下解决的。由于它是根据国家计划和人民需要而开设和进行生产的，因此原料由国家保证供应，生产出来的产品也由国家负责包销；即使在全国黄麻生产不足的情况下，他们也可以获得必要的原料，不至于因原料不足而减产。同时，工厂的经营管理是按照社会主义经营管理的原则进行，在这里没有像在资本主义企业中那种劳资之间的矛盾，他们只有一个共同愿望：生产更多更好的麻袋支援国家建设。1955年就由于工人提高了黄麻的精洗率，和在纺织过程中减少了回丝，一年来所节约的原料，就可以增产十七万条麻袋，成本也因此降低了
  10.5％。这样的工厂当然会不断发展的。这个厂是1953年8月投入生产的，到年底只产了麻袋二十五万条，但是到第二年年产量就达到了276万多条，去年又增加到290多万条，今年计划生产460万条。开始只开一班，1954年以后就改开两班，今年要求开三班。但是这样还是不能满足国家的需要，因此他们正在准备进行扩建，生产能力要求提高到年产麻袋九百万条。1953年刚投入生产，困难较多，但是也不盈不亏；1954年就盈利136万元，1955年增加到151万元，今年预计可盈利三百万元。
    公私合营华南企业公司、华侨工业建设公司和广州投资公司，在过去几年中，虽然困难比较多，但是他们一共盈利六百多万元，其中就有二百万元做为股息和红利分给私股股东。华侨投资公司，一年来也盈利三百四十多万元，其中作为股息分配给私股股东的有一百一十多万元。许多华侨和港澳同胞把这股息作为子女的教育费用；有些华侨股东的子女在国内读书，他们就委托公司按月把股息寄给他们的子女。
    华侨投资公司经营上的成就，充分说明了华侨和港澳同胞投资建设祖国，不但对国家有功，而且对自己也有利。许多华侨和港澳的工商业者，在资本主义经济危机的威胁下，都希望为自己的资金找一条最有保障的出路。出路在哪里呢？华侨投资公司的一位股东肯定地回答了这个问题，他说：“我在国外曾经想：把我的资金购买外资公司的股票吧？但是根据今天的情况看，必须估计到1926年那种不景气局面的重临；用来购买黄金吧？但是眼看金价每两由港币六百多元跌到二百多元，……想来想去，最后还是选定投回祖国来。祖国欣欣向荣，对华侨又是那么优待，回国投资，对国家建设也算尽了自己的一分力量，而自己的资金也得到保障，家人子弟生活都有着落，这实在是最可靠也最有前途的一条出路了。”
