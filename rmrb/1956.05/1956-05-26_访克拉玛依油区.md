Visiting the Karamay Oil Region
　　Chu Anping

On May 11th, the person in charge of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry announced in Beijing that the Karamay area of the Junggar Basin in Xinjiang had been confirmed as a promising large oil field. On the same day, I traveled more than 400 kilometers from Urumqi to visit Karamay.

First, we followed the Urumqi-Yining Highway to Dushanzi. From Dushanzi, a newly built highway leads north directly to Karamay. This 160-kilometer-long highway, which was only opened a few months ago, is like a sharp sword piercing straight into the Junggar Basin. As we approached the central area between the Tianshan and Altai Mountains, we saw the mountain range called Chengjisi Han (Genghis Khan) Mountain winding from west to east along the western edge of the Junggar Basin. This blue mountain range, not very high, with a ridge as neat as a row of city walls, adds a lot of charm to the Junggar Basin. And this newly discovered, exciting Karamay oil field is spread out on the southern foothills of Chengjisi Han Mountain.

Driving on this newly opened highway, we saw nothing but a vast Gobi desert and boundless sky. No trees, no water, no villages. It was not until we approached the foot of Chengjisi Han Mountain that we suddenly saw many derricks, majestically erected in the vast wilderness. Their appearance heralds a historic change on this land that has been sleeping for thousands of years, a change that will bring about an unprecedented and magnificent petroleum industry for the motherland.

We finally drove into the current temporary office location of the mining area; it was crowded with many trucks, tents, dugouts, and rows of movable small wooden houses. The rapid drilling of wells and the gushing of oil were so fast that all ideological and equipment preparations could not keep up. Excitement, tension, and constraint intertwined into a fiery emotion that permeated the entire mining area. People are overcoming all difficulties with infinite spirit, fighting there steadfastly day and night, and enthusiastically looking forward to the nationwide support of manpower, material resources, and technology.

After the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company (the predecessor of today's Xinjiang Petroleum Company), exploration was conducted in the Karamay area under the leadership of Soviet experts, and several oil-bearing structures were initially identified. In July 1955, the Xinjiang Petroleum Company organized a tenacious youth drilling team from the Dushanzi mining area to drill the first well in Karamay. At that time, the working conditions in Karamay were extremely difficult. First of all, there was no water. Water had to be hauled from Xiaoguai, more than sixty kilometers away. Once, a water truck broke down halfway because the water in the tank dried up due to the hot weather. The truck was stranded in the Gobi desert, and they waited for a long time, but still did not see a passerby or a passing vehicle. In the end, the two water workers had to walk back to Karamay to report for help under the scorching sun of the Gobi desert, while the driver was trapped in the driver's seat guarding the car. The two workers walked for six hours before returning to Karamay, but as soon as they arrived, they fainted from thirst. At that time, there were no houses in Karamay, so they slept in the open air, and mosquitoes bit them so they couldn't sleep. There was no kitchen, so they used three stones to set up a pot for cooking. Firewood had to be fetched from a place more than ten kilometers away. There were also frequent strong winds. When the wind came, the derricks swayed. Sometimes, after the drill pipe was raised, it was blown around by the wind, couldn't be aligned with the opening, and couldn't be put down. People couldn't open their eyes in the wind, and if they didn't hold on to something with both hands, they couldn't stand still. However, such a difficult environment did not overwhelm those brave young drilling team members. They had made full ideological preparations before arriving in Karamay and made firm guarantees. On October 30, 1955, the first well finally gushed oil, which was the greatest reward for the brave behavior of those young drilling team members. That day, the shift that was supposed to get off work at twelve o'clock at night refused to go back to rest after their shift. They set up a fire not far from the derrick, and everyone gathered around the fire, excitedly talking about how much the motherland needed more oil and the bright prospects of the Karamay oil field, and talked until almost dawn before going back to sleep.

The news that the first well produced oil immediately shocked all those who cared about the fate of this area. From this year on, new derricks have been erected one after another on this desolate land. On April 23rd, the second well also gushed oil automatically. On May 7th, the third well also produced oil. The oil production of the second well was four times greater than that of the first well, and the oil production of the third well was 2.4 times greater than that of the second well. When I visited Karamay, I visited the No. 7 well, which had just produced oil a few days ago. The dark brown, thick crude oil was gushing out automatically in the pipes.

From the perspective of the petroleum industry, Karamay is an oil area with many favorable conditions. Its geological conditions are relatively simple, and the drilling conditions are also superior. Oil production is fast and investment is small. The two wells that recently produced oil were drilled in just over a month. In addition, two or three wells that were drilled in April will also produce oil in the near future. At the same time, the oil reserves in this area are also very rich. Based on the oil reserves in the 27 square kilometers occupied by the several wells that have already produced or will soon produce oil, it has already greatly exceeded the total recoverable reserves task given to the Xinjiang Petroleum Company by the state in the First Five-Year Plan.

Currently, two wells are being drilled eight kilometers northeast and thirteen kilometers northeast of the temporary office location in the mining area. Now, oil flowers have emerged in the mud in both wells. As announced by the person in charge of the Ministry of Petroleum Industry: "If calculated based on this year's (Karamay) exploration area, then the (Karamay's) oil reserves will be several times greater than those of the Yumen Laojunmiao oil field."

Not only that, in Urho, about 100 kilometers northeast of Karamay, a 30-kilometer-long oil outcrop has also been discovered, and shallow drilling has also revealed that there is oil sand in that area. In some areas between Karamay and Urho, fairly thick oil layers have also been drilled. In such a situation, the entire oil area, which is more than one hundred kilometers long from north to south and about thirty or forty kilometers wide from east to west, may expand to several thousand square kilometers.

The current overall situation is: on a straight line from the southwest end of Karamay to the northeast end of Urho, several lines are being drilled in the southeast direction like arrows fired simultaneously. The above are all on the west bank of the Manas River. It is now planned to drill a well on the east bank of the Manas River between Dagai and Zhonggai. If oil layers can also be drilled on the east bank of the Manas River, then it will gradually extend into the entire Junggar Basin; at that time, the scale will be even more unimaginable.

The above is an outline and prospect of the petroleum resources in the newly confirmed Karamay area. In such a large oil area, it may be possible to find not just one but several oil fields in the future. Similarly, in this large area, there may be not just one but several emerging petroleum industry cities in the future. Karamay has the hope of becoming a large oil area "that can meet the needs of the country."

As for the most pressing problems in the Karamay area at present: The first is the water problem. The mining area has already drilled a water well, but it can only supply industrial water needs. There is no drinking water nearby, and it is expected that people will surge in like a tide in a very short time. At the end of 1955, there were only a few dozen people working in Karamay, but now there are nearly a thousand. In two or three months, it is estimated that the number will immediately increase to four or five thousand. The water problem urgently needs to be solved. Currently, there are plans to lay steel pipes from Qingliugou, 50 kilometers southwest of Karamay, to bring water over. In the future, steel pipes will also be laid from a place more than 70 kilometers northeast to bring water from Lake Ailik. The second is the road problem. The 160-kilometer new highway from Dushanzi to Karamay has only been paved halfway, and the other half is still a dirt road. In view of the increasing transportation tasks, it is not only urgent to repair the entire road, but also to improve the construction of the highway to a fairly high level. In addition, the approximately 100-kilometer road from Karamay to Urho also needs to be built quickly. The third is the housing problem. Currently, there are plans to build 35,000 square meters of dormitories first, which are required to be completed by mid-August at the latest. The fourth is to build another 30,000 square meters of buildings for power generation, repair, storage, and other purposes. The solution of these four problems has a decisive impact on the accelerated development of Karamay.

The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has used great efforts to support the development of the Karamay area. They have allocated a construction army to Karamay to build roads and houses. Tens of thousands of square meters of buildings are required to be completed within two to three months, and most of the building materials have to be transported from outside, which is a fairly urgent and heavy task. In addition, the autonomous region has allocated more than 500 trucks to strengthen the transportation force for developing the Karamay area. The local authorities have already made considerable efforts, but these forces can only solve part of the current emergency needs. The scale of Karamay's development is too large. In the next two years alone, hundreds of thousands of tons of materials will have to be transported in. The number of vehicles they need is not in the hundreds, but in the thousands. Not only do they need cars, but they also need to be equipped with drivers. They need to build at least 300,000 square meters of industrial and non-industrial buildings next year, which requires a huge construction team and a huge amount of building materials. They need the design and construction capacity of new refineries, and they need the design and laying capacity of oil pipelines. In terms of machinery, they need more than 50 shallow drilling rigs. They also need a machine repair factory; they need equipment that is commensurate with the scale of work, and they need to be equipped with enough workers. They need huge amounts of steel plates, steel pipes, and other various steel materials. They need technical forces in geology, drilling, oil production, and refining, and they also need a large number of administrative cadres. All of this cannot be solved by the Xinjiang Petroleum Company or the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region alone.

When I left Karamay, the comrades there shook my hand tightly and said: "We are mobilizing all forces here and doing our best to persevere. But we are even more eagerly looking forward to the huge support of manpower, material resources, and technology from all over the country. We must rely on the strength of the whole country to accelerate the development of such a large-scale and promising Karamay oil area."

    访克拉玛依油区
    储安平
    五月十一日，石油工业部负责人在北京宣布：新疆准噶尔盆地的克拉玛依地区已经证实是一个很有希望的大油田。就在这同一天，我从乌鲁木齐赶了四百多公里路，专程访问了克拉玛依。
    先循乌伊公路到独山子。从独山子，有一条新修的公路向北直达克拉玛依。这条长达一百六十公里、在几个月以前才开辟的公路，就像一柄利剑似的笔直地刺入了准噶尔盆地。当我们快要到达天山、阿尔泰山之间的中心地带的时候，就远远看到那条称为成吉思汗山的山岭从西迤东蜿蜒在准噶尔盆地的西沿。这条青色的、不很高的、山脊齐整得就像一排城墙一样的山岭，给准噶尔盆地增添了不少妩媚。而这新近发现的振奋人心的克拉玛依大油田，就铺展在成吉思汗山的南麓。
    我们在这条新辟的公路上行驶，除了一片戈壁和万里云天以外，什么都看不到。没有树木，没有水，没有村庄人家。直到快近成吉思汗山山根，我们陡然看到了好些井架，威严地竖立在那旷远的原野上。它们的出现向人们预报：在这片酣睡千年的大地上，就要掀起历史性的变化，使祖国出现空前壮阔的石油工业。
    我们终于驶进了目前矿区临时办公的地点；那儿拥挤着很多卡车、帐篷、地窝子以及一排一排可以移动的小木房子。井钻得这样快速，油喷得这样汹涌，使一切思想上的和设备上的准备都跟不上去。兴奋、紧张、局促，交织成一片像火一样炽烈的情绪，弥漫着整个矿区。人们都以无限饱满的精神，克服一切困难，坚定地、夜以继日地在那儿战斗，并且满腔热情地期待着全国范围的人力物力技术的大支援。
    中苏石油公司（今新疆石油公司的前身）成立以后，在苏联专家的领导下，曾经在克拉玛依地区进行勘探，初步探明了几个储油构造。1955年7月，新疆石油公司从独山子矿区组织了一支顽强的青年钻井队，在克拉玛依开钻了第一口井。那时，克拉玛依的工作条件是异常艰难的。首先是没有水。水要到六十几公里以外的小拐地方去拉。有一次，拉水汽车走到一半，由于天气太热，水箱里的水干了，车抛锚在戈壁上，等了好久，还是没有等到一个过往的人或一辆过往的车。最后，那两个拉水工人只得冒着戈壁上的灼热的太阳走回克拉玛依报信求援，司机则困守在车座上守着汽车。那两个工人走了六小时才走回克拉玛依，可是一到克拉玛依，两个人就干渴得昏倒在地上。那时克拉玛依也没有一间房子，睡就睡在露天里，蚊子咬得人睡不着。没有伙房，用三块石头架着一个锅烧饭。柴要到十几公里以外的地方去打。那儿又常常刮大风。大风一来，井架都被刮得摇摇荡荡。有时钻杆起了上来以后，被风刮得东摇西摆，对不准口，放不下去。人在风里睁不开眼，要是两手不攀住什么地方就会站不住脚。然而这样艰难的环境没有压倒那些勇敢的青年钻井队员。他们到达克拉玛依以前都作了充分的思想准备，并且提出了坚决的保证。1955年10月30日，这第一口井终于喷出油来了，这使那些青年钻井队员的勇敢行为获得了最大的报酬。那天本应该夜晚十二点下班的一个班，下班以后都不肯回去休息，他们在井架不远的地方烤起火来，大家围着火，兴奋地谈着祖国如何需要更多的石油和克拉玛依油田的光明的远景，一直谈到天快亮，才回去睡。
    这第一口井出油的消息，立刻震动了所有关切着这一块地区的命运的人们。从今年起，新的井架一个接一个地在这荒漠的大地上竖了起来。四月二十三日，第二口井又自动喷出了油。五月七日，又有第三口井出了油。第二口出油的井的出油量比第一口井大四倍，而第三口出油的井的出油量又比第二口井大二点四倍。我在克拉玛依访问的时候，参观了才在几天以前出油的那口七号井，那深褐色的浑厚的原油正一股一股猛烈地在管子里自动喷射出来。
    从石油工业的角度来说，克拉玛依是一个具有很多有利条件的石油地区。它的地质情况比较简单，钻探条件也较优越。出油快，投资少。像最近出油的两口井都只钻了一个多月。另外还有两三口在四月里开钻的井，在最近期内也将陆续出油。同时，这一地区的油量也非常丰富。以目前已经和即将出油的几口井所占的二十七平方公里面积的储油量说，就已经大大超过了第一个五年计划中国家所给予新疆石油公司的全部可采储量的任务了。
    目前在矿区临时办公地点东北八公里和十三公里两个地方开钻了两口井。现在这两口井也都已经有油花在泥浆里泛出来。正如石油工业部负责人所宣布的：“如果以今年（克拉玛依）的勘探地区计算，那末（克拉玛依的）储油量就将超过玉门老君庙油田好几倍。”
    不仅如此，在克拉玛依东北约一百公里的乌尔禾地方，也已发现了长达三十公里的露头油苗，同时经过浅钻也探明那一带有油沙。在克拉玛依和乌尔禾之间的一些地带，也钻探到相当厚的油层。在这样的情况下，南北长达一百几十公里、东西宽约三四十公里，整个油区的面积可能扩展到几千平方公里。
    目前整个的形势是：在从克拉玛依南头偏西到北头偏东的乌尔禾这一条直线上，像数箭齐发地正分几条线向东南方向钻探着。以上都在玛纳斯河的西岸。现在还计划在大拐和中拐之间的玛纳斯河东岸也钻一口井。假如在玛纳斯河东岸也能钻到油层的话，那就将逐步伸入整个的准噶尔盆地；那时规模之大，就更难想像了。
    以上就是新近被证实的克拉玛依地区的石油资源的一个轮廓和前景。在这样一个大面积的油区中，将来可能找出不止一个而是几个油田。同样，在这个大面积上，将来可能出现不止一个而是几个新兴的石油工业城市。克拉玛依有希望成为一个“可以满足国家需要”的大油区。
    就当前克拉玛依地区最最迫切的问题来说：第一是水的问题。矿区已经打了一口水井，但只能供应工业用水的需要，人吃的水附近没有，而眼看人又将在很短的日子内像潮水一样地汹涌而来。1955年底，在克拉玛依工作的不过几十个人，而现在已经接近一千人。在两三个月以内，估计立刻会增加到四五千人。水的问题急切需要解决。目前计划从克拉玛依西南五十公里的青柳沟敷设钢管，把水引过来。将来还要从东北七十多公里的地方敷设钢管把艾里克湖的水引过来。其次是公路问题。从独山子到克拉玛依的一百六十公里的这条新公路，路面还只铺了一半，其余一半还是土路。鉴于运输任务的日益繁重，不仅急切要把全路修好，而且要把公路的修筑提高到相当高级的水平上去。此外，从克拉玛依到乌尔禾大约一百公里的公路也需要很快地修筑起来。第三是房子问题。目前计划先修三万五千平方公尺的宿舍，要求至迟在八月中能完工。第四是还要另修三万平方公尺的供发电、修理、库房等用的建筑物。这四个问题的解决对于克拉玛依的加速开发有决定性的影响。
    新疆维吾尔自治区已经用很大的力量来支援克拉玛依地区的开发工作。他们拨了一支建筑部队到克拉玛依去修路盖房，几万平方公尺的建筑要限两个月至三个月内完成，而绝大部分的建筑器材都要从外面运去，这个任务是相当紧急沉重的。此外，自治区又拨了五百多辆卡车，以加强开发克拉玛依地区的运输力量。地方当局，已经尽了相当大的努力，但是这些力量还只能解决当前一部分的紧急需要。克拉玛依的开发规模太大了，就以今明两年来说，要有几十万吨的器材运进去。他们所需要的运输车辆不是以百计，而是以千计。不仅要车子，还要配备司机。他们明年至少要修建三十万平方公尺的工业性和非工业性的建筑，这就需要庞大的建筑队伍和数量巨大的建筑器材。他们需要新的炼油厂的设计力量和承造力量，他们需要输油管线的设计力量和敷设力量。在机械方面，他们要五十部以上的浅钻机。还要一个机器修理厂；既要有跟工作规模相适应的设备，还要配备好足够的工人。他们需要巨量的钢板、钢管和其他各种钢材。他们需要地质、钻探、采油、炼油各方面的技术力量，还需要巨大数量的行政干部。而这一切都不是新疆石油公司或新疆维吾尔自治区所能解决得了的。
    当我离开克拉玛依的时候，那儿的同志们紧紧地握着我的手说：“我们在这儿动员一切力量，尽我们一切努力坚持下去。但是我们更迫切地期待全国人力物力技术的巨大支援。必须依靠全国的力量，才能把这样规模巨大、前景壮阔的克拉玛依油区加速开发出来。”
