Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 13th. To ensure that agricultural production cooperatives increase production and that 90% of their members increase their income, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided at a meeting of prefectural and county party secretaries held from the 8th to the 11th that strengthening the late-stage management of wheat, striving for a bumper wheat harvest, preparing for wheat pre-distribution, and developing diversified rural sideline production must be the focus of current rural work.

The meeting decided that, in addition to strengthening late-stage wheat management to strive for a bumper wheat harvest, the principle of "less deduction and more distribution" must be implemented in the summer harvest distribution. The expenses retained by general agricultural cooperatives should be controlled at around 30% of the cooperative's spring and summer production income, and should not exceed 35% at most. Each cooperative must also conscientiously carry out work and account clearing. Those that have not yet been completed should establish a normal financial management system in conjunction with wheat pre-distribution, review expenditures according to the principle of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily, and reduce non-production expenditures. The issue of subsidies for township and cooperative cadres must be controlled within the prescribed limits and must not be exceeded. In order to increase the income of cooperative members, the meeting also decided that the state's loan recovery work can be increased in cooperatives with good wheat harvests, and reduced or postponed to the autumn harvest in those with poor wheat harvests. Personal living loans, grain, and coal sales on credit to cooperative members should not be deducted by the cooperative as a whole, but should be handled separately according to the actual income of each cooperative member.

Regarding the issue of developing diversified sideline production, which is the most pressing demand of the vast number of cooperative members, the meeting emphasized that this is one of the important items for whether more than 90% of cooperative members can increase their income. The annual sideline income of farmers in Hebei Province generally accounts for more than 20% of the total production income, and in some special areas, it reaches 30% to 40%. Party and government leaders at all levels must attach great importance to this work. Agriculture and sideline occupations should be planned in a unified manner, and current plans and longer-term plans for developing sideline occupations should be formulated. At present, we must plan and act simultaneously. Various methods, whether operated by the cooperative, the team, the group, or by individual members, can be adopted. Under the cooperative's overall arrangement, appropriate divisions should be made. The cooperative should not control too rigidly the sideline occupations that are suitable for individual members or small groups to operate in a decentralized manner. It should find more ways and be diverse, taking into account both large and small, and developing actively and steadily according to local conditions. In particular, the hog raising industry is required to develop to eight million head this year, reaching six million head before June. The income from other various large and small sideline production should also strive to reach or exceed last year's level based on specific conditions.

In order to ensure the correct implementation of the above measures, the meeting also studied how to improve leadership methods and how to help agricultural cooperatives improve their management.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 13th. Appropriately reducing agricultural capital construction in order to concentrate efforts on developing agriculture and sideline production and increase the income of agricultural production cooperative members is one of the important measures for rectifying agricultural cooperatives currently proposed by the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party at a joint meeting of prefectural and municipal party secretaries held from the 7th to the 10th.

Since last winter, more than 19,000 agricultural cooperatives in Shanxi Province have launched large-scale agricultural capital construction. According to recent inspections, many cooperatives, due to overly high capital construction plans and blind construction, have not only affected the current sowing but also caused disguised waste of manpower and materials. After inspecting this situation, the meeting decided to first reduce the province's 1956 plan to expand irrigation areas and the area controlled for soil and water conservation. The meeting required agricultural cooperatives in various places to generally review and revise production plans. Agricultural capital construction should be classified according to its importance and urgency, and projects that can be postponed and those that will not be profitable in the current year should be reduced as much as possible. The labor days of cooperative members participating in capital construction should also be reasonably resolved by giving full remuneration, partial remuneration, or apportioning compulsory labor based on the situation of benefiting in the current year or benefiting in the following year, to prevent the phenomenon of excessive labor use for capital construction causing a relative reduction in cooperative members' income.

The meeting also, based on the situation in some cooperatives where excessive restrictions on cooperative members' individual activities have led to the decline of cooperative members' household sideline occupations, required that, in addition to continuing to do a good job in collectively managed sideline production, the types and scope of sideline occupations managed by the cooperative and by individual cooperative members should be distinguished, and in the spirit of both public and private interests, divide labor and cooperate to freely mobilize cooperative members to engage in sideline production.

The income from sideline occupations managed by cooperative members shall be entirely at the disposal of individuals. For cash income from collectively managed sideline production, cooperative members should be allowed to pre-draw half of the remuneration based on the number of labor days already invested in order to solve the problem of cooperative members' pocket money.

After research, the meeting also made specific standards for the distribution of income, the internal financial expenditure of the cooperative, the accumulation of public property, and the establishment of various welfare undertakings in agricultural cooperatives. According to these regulations, 60% to 71% of the total income of agricultural cooperatives in the province will be distributed to cooperative members, ensuring that more than 90% of cooperative members can increase their income compared to last year on the basis of developing production.

    中共河北省委、山西省委召开会议
    保证90％的农业合作社社员增加收入
    据新华社保定13日电　为了保证农业生产合作社增加生产、90％的社员增加收入，中共河北省委员会在八日到十一日举行的地委、县委书记会议上决定，必须把加强小麦后期的管理，争取小麦丰收，作好小麦预分工作和发展农村多种副业生产，作为当前农村工作的中心。
    会议决定：当前除了必须加强小麦后期管理争取小麦丰收以外，在夏收分配工作中，必须贯彻“少扣多分”的原则，一般农业社扣留的开支数应控制在这个社春夏两季生产收入的30％左右，最多不得超过35％。各社还要认真进行清工清账，现在未作完的要结合小麦预分建立起正常的财务管理制度，按勤俭办社原则审查开支，压缩非生产性的开支。关于乡、社干部补助工的问题，一定要控制在规定的幅度之内，不得超过。为了增加社员收入，会议上还决定：国家的贷款回收工作，在麦多收成好的社里可以多收回一些；麦少收成不好的要少收回一些或缓到秋收时再说。对社员个人生活贷款、粮食和煤的赊销款，不应由社总扣，应根据各个社员实际收入多少，分别处理。
    关于广大社员最迫切要求的开展多种副业生产问题，会议上强调指出，这是90％以上社员能否增加收入的重要项目之一，河北全省农民每年副业收入一般达生产总收入的20％以上，有的专区达到30％至40％，各级党、政领导必须十分重视这一工作。应把农业和副业统一规划，并制定发展副业的当前计划和较长时期的规划。目前就要边计划边行动，不论由社营、队营、组营或由社员个人经营各种方式都可采用，要在社的统筹安排下作适当划分，社里对适合于社员个人或小组分散经营的副业，不要控制太死，要多找门路，多种多样，大小兼顾，因地制宜，积极稳步地发展，特别对养猪业要求在今年发展到八百万口，六月以前达到六百万口。其他各种大、小型副业生产收入也要根据具体条件争取达到和超过去年的水平。
    为了保证以上各项措施的正确贯彻实行，会议还研究了改进领导方法和如何帮助农业社改进经营管理等问题。
    据新华社太原13日电　适当缩减农业基本建设，以便集中力量发展农业和副业生产，增加农业生产合作社社员的收入，这是中共山西省委员会在七日到十日召开的地委、市委书记联席会上提出的当前整顿农业社的重要措施之一。
    山西省一万九千多个农业社从去年冬天以来就开展大规模的农业基本建设。据最近检查发现，许多社由于基本建设计划偏高和盲目施工，不仅影响当前播种，还造成人力物力的变相浪费。这次会议在检查了这种情况后，决定首先缩减全省1956年扩大灌溉面积的计划和水土保持控制面积。会议要求各地农业社要普遍审查和修订生产计划。对农业基本建设要区别轻重缓急，分类排队，尽量减缩可以缓办的和当年不得利的。对社员参加基本建设的劳动工数，也应分别当年得利和隔年得利的情况，采取给以全部报酬、一部报酬或按劳力平均摊派义务工等办法，合理解决，防止发生因基本建设用工过多，使社员收入相对减少的现象。
    会议还根据某些社对社员个人活动限制过多，造成社员家庭副业衰退的情况，要求除继续作好集体经营的副业生产外，还要划清社营和社员个人经营的副业种类和范围，本公私兼顾的精神，分工协作，放手发动社员搞副业生产。
    社员经营的副业收入，全部归个人支配。集体经营的副业生产的现金收入，应该允许社员按已经投入的劳动日数预支一半的报酬，以解决社员零用钱的问题。
    这次会议经过研究以后，还作出了有关农业社收益分配、社内财政开支、公共财产积累和举办各种福利事业等具体标准的规定，按照这些规定，全省农业社的总收入都将有60％到71％归社员分配，保证90％以上的社员能在发展生产的基础上比去年增加收入。
