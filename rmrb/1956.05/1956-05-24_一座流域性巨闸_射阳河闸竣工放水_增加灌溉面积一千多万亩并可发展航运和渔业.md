This newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch: On the afternoon of the 23rd, the Sheyang River Sluice Gate, the second modern large-scale river basin sluice gate newly built in Jiangsu Province after the Sanhe Sluice Gate, began releasing water. The entire project was completed one month ahead of the original plan. This sluice gate is the primary project in the drainage and tide-blocking project in the Lixiahe area of the lower reaches of the Huai River.

The weather was clear on the 23rd. The Sheyang River Sluice Gate, standing on the coast of the Yellow Sea, was extraordinarily magnificent. Red flags fluttered and colored ribbons waved around the 410-meter-long embankment. Congratulations sent from various places were hung in a dazzling array. At 1:40 PM, a grand completion and water release ceremony for the Sheyang River Sluice Gate was solemnly held on the colorful "Communist Youth League Bridge." More than 13,000 people attended the conference. Zhou Junming, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources, Leng Yu, Vice Governor of Jiangsu Province, Chen Lisheng, Director of the Huai River Management Committee Office, and Chen Zonglie, Secretary of the Yancheng Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended the conference and spoke. At the meeting, more than 300 people who contributed to the construction of the sluice gate and model workers received award flags, bonuses, and prizes such as water buffaloes and double-furrow plows.

At 4 PM, after Vice Governor Leng Yu cut the ribbon, the electrician in the control room pressed the button in front of the gate opening and closing machine in three batches. The 35 steel gates slowly rose, and suddenly splashing waves gushed out of the gate opening. The surging flood rushed through the gate and immediately tamely passed through the diversion canal, flowing towards the Yellow Sea. At this time, people enthusiastically cheered for the Sheyang River's two banks being forever free from the disasters of sea tides and floods.

The Sheyang River Sluice Gate is built south of Tongxing Town, Sheyang County, on the coast of the Yellow Sea. The entire project includes four main projects: the Sheyang River Dam, the upper and lower diversion canals, the barrage dam, and the Sheyang River to Xinyang Port seawall. This sluice gate was designed with reference to advanced Soviet experience and according to the highest flood level encountered once in a century. The dam has 35 openings, each equipped with an automated gate. Navigation channels as high as six-story buildings are built on both sides of the gate. During the flood season when the Huai River rises sharply or during heavy rains, the gate can be opened to release floodwaters. When the sea tide flows backward, the gate can be closed to block the tide and brine. In peacetime, fresh water can be stored to irrigate more than 14 million mu of farmland on both banks, and the Sheyang River's water level can be regulated to develop fisheries and shipping. According to estimates, after the completion of the Sheyang River Sluice Gate, the annual increase in production benefits will reach more than 130 million catties of grain.

    一座流域性巨闸——射阳河闸竣工放水
    增加灌溉面积一千多万亩并可发展航运和渔业
    本报南京23日电　二十三日下午，江苏省继三河闸之后新建的第二座近代化的流域性巨闸射阳河闸开始放水，整个工程比原计划提前一个月竣工。这个闸是淮河下游里下河地区排水挡潮工程中的首要工程。
    二十三日天气晴朗。矗立在黄海海滨的射阳河闸打扮得异常壮丽，环绕四百一十公尺长的堤身上，红旗招展，彩绸飘扬，各地送来的庆贺喜幛，挂得琳琅满目。下午一时四十分，在五彩缤纷的“共青桥”上隆重举行射阳河闸竣工放水典礼大会。参加大会的有一万三千多人，水利部副部长周骏鸣、江苏省副省长冷遹、治淮委员会办公室主任陈力生和中共盐城地委书记陈宗烈等出席了大会，并且讲了话。会上，三百多个建闸有功人员、劳动模范得到了奖旗、奖金和水牛、双铧犁等奖品。
    四时，副省长冷遹剪彩后，控制室内的电工在闸门启闭机前分三批按动电钮，三十五孔钢质闸门徐徐升起，顿时闸门口奔泄出飞溅的浪花，汹涌的洪水冲过闸门，立刻驯服地通过引河，向黄海流去。这时人们热烈地为射阳河两岸永远摆脱海潮、洪水的灾害而欢呼。
    射阳河闸建筑在黄海海滨射阳县通兴镇南边，整个工程包括射阳河大闸、上下引河、拦河坝、射阳河至新洋港海堤等四项主要工程。这个闸是吸取苏联先进经验，根据百年一遇的最高洪水位设计的。大闸有三十五孔，每孔都装有自动化的闸门，闸两侧筑有六层楼高的航道孔。在汛期淮水暴涨或暴雨时，可以开闸放出洪水。当海潮倒灌时，可以关闸挡住潮水和卤水。平时可以蓄贮淡水灌溉两岸一千四百多万亩耕地，并且能调剂射阳河水位，发展渔业和航运。根据估计，射阳河闸建成以后，每年增产效益将达到一亿三千多万斤粮食。
