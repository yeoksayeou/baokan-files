Installing “Flow Guides” on Tugboats

The Yangtze River Navigation Administration is actively promoting the Soviet advanced experience of installing “flow guides” on tugboats to improve the towing efficiency of the tugboats. The bureau plans to install flow guides on 114 tugboats before the end of October this year. The increased towing efficiency of these 114 tugboats after the modification is equivalent to adding twenty-five 500-horsepower tugboats. Currently, the “Changjiang 209” and “Changjiang 142” tugboats have been modified and are participating in navigation; the "Changjiang 203" and four other tugboats are being modified in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places.

The flow guide is a nozzle-shaped cylinder套 installed outside the stern propeller of the ship. When the propeller rotates, additional thrust is generated on each cross-section of the flow guide. This can increase the towing efficiency of the tugboat by 20% to 30%. (Xia Lin)

    在拖轮上装置“导流管”
    长江航运管理局积极推广在拖轮上装置“导流管”的苏联先进经验，以提高拖轮的牵引效率。这个局计划在今年十月底以前将114艘拖轮装上导流管。这114艘拖轮改装以后提高的牵引效率，相当于添置五百马力的拖轮二十五艘。现在，“长江209”、“长江142”两艘拖轮已经改装完毕，参加了航运；“长江203”等四艘拖轮正在南京、上海等地改装。
    导流管是套装在船尾车叶外的喷管状的圆筒。车叶转动的时候，就在导流管的每个断面上产生附加推力。这样就可以使拖轮的牵引效率提高20％到30％。　（夏林）
