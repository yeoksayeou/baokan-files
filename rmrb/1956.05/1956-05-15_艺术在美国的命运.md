According to a report in the New York "Daily Worker," Democratic Senator Lehman recently submitted a report to Congress on the state of art in America. This report was drafted by a national committee composed of prominent representatives of the American art world. The report discussed the unfortunate situation of some art sectors in today's America:

	Musicians' Income Insufficient to Live On
	The report states that the economic situation of professional musicians is deteriorating significantly. "The average annual income of a symphony orchestra musician is currently about $1,400 to $1,500, and it is impossible to support a family on such a low income." (Note: According to the estimate of the well-known Heller Committee for Social and Economic Research, in 1955, a family of four in the United States needed more than $5,400 a year to live a basic life.) "Therefore, many young people with musical talent are currently forced to engage in other professions. The average age of symphony orchestra musicians is getting older and older, and the problem of maintaining our major symphony orchestras is becoming more acute with each season."

	Decline of Drama
	"In large areas of the United States, there is currently no professional theater." "Those theaters and opera houses that were once opened for touring performances no longer exist. They have been demolished or converted into cinemas or used for other purposes." The report points out, however, that the effect of theater plays on the audience can never be provided by the movies, television, and radio that currently flood the United States.

	Opera in a Sad State
	The report states, "American opera houses are in a sad state. Currently, only one or two permanent opera companies can maintain considerable performance activity. There are no opera houses or full-time opera companies in all of our nation's larger cities." "Due to the very limited performance opportunities in the United States, only a handful of outstanding singers can hope to make a living by singing in opera houses."

	Architectural Art Lags Behind
	"The application of fine arts in public buildings in the United States has lagged far behind European countries. The current official slogan—'Decorate Federal Buildings'—clearly illustrates that fine art is not an integral part of architecture but is merely something that is added as an afterthought."

	Dancers Unemployed
	"The activities of professional stages in the United States are far from guaranteeing even partial employment for talented young people." "In New York, when a dance troupe wants to recruit four to fifteen dancers and hold auditions, 200 to 400 dancers from all over the country apply. Among these people, perhaps 75% to 80% are qualified, but only less than 10% may be needed. The number of ballet troupes is also very limited, and these troupes almost always have to tour to survive. In the past few years, many foreign dance troupes have come to perform in the United States, but only two American dance troupes are qualified to conduct this kind of international cultural exchange."

### 艺术在美国的命运

    艺术在美国的命运
    据纽约“工人日报”报道，美国民主党参议员利曼最近向国会提出了一份关于美国艺术情况的报告。这个报告是由美国艺术界著名代表组成的一个全国委员会拟就的。报告里谈到一些艺术部门在今日美国的不幸境遇：
    音乐家收入不足糊口
    报告说，职业音乐家的经济状况在显著地恶化着，“一个交响乐队音乐家现在每年的平均收入约为一千四百到一千五百美元，而要依靠这样少的收入来维持一家生活费用是不可能的。”（按：据美国有名的海勒社会经济研究委员会的估计，1955年美国四口之家过最普通的生活一年需要开支五千四百多美元）“因此，许多有音乐天才的青年人目前都不得不从事其他职业。交响乐队音乐家的平均年龄正在愈来愈大，维持我们的大交响乐队的问题一季比一季尖锐。”
       戏剧没落
    “在美国的大片大片地区，目前没有一家专业性的剧院”，“那些一度为巡回演出而开办的剧院和歌剧院现在已经不再存在了。它们被拆掉，或者被改为电影院或作其他用途”。报告里指出，然而，剧院里的戏剧对观众产生的效果，绝不是目前充斥着美国的电影、电视和无线电所能给予的。
    歌剧处在可悲状态
    报告说，“美国的歌剧院正在处于可悲状态。目前只有一两个常设性的歌剧团可以维持相当的演出活动。在我们国家所有较大的城市中都没有歌剧院或者专职性的歌剧团。”“由于目前在美国演出的机会非常有限，只有寥寥无几的杰出的歌唱家才可以指望靠着在歌剧院的演唱来维持生活。”
    建筑艺术落后
    “美国在公共建筑中应用美术已经大大落后于欧洲国家。当前的官方口号——
  ‘装饰联邦大厦’，清楚地说明美术不是建筑的组成部分，而只是在事后想起来再加上去的东西。”
     舞蹈家失业
    “美国的专业性舞台的活动远远不能保证那些有天才的青年人获得甚至是部分的就业”。“在纽约，当一个舞蹈团要招收四个到十五个舞蹈家并且举行测验的时候，就有二百到四百名来自各地的舞蹈家提出申请。在这些人当中，可能有75％到80％是合格的，但是所需要的可能只有不到10％。巴蕾舞剧团的数目也很有限，这些剧团差不多要经常作巡回演出以维持生存。在过去几年中，外国有许多舞蹈团来美国表演，但是美国只有两个舞蹈团是够条件来进行这种国际文化交流的。”
