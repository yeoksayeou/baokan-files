　　“Yakovlev-24" - The Largest Helicopter
    Moscow Dispatch, May 7th. The "Pravda" today published an interview with the famous aircraft designer Yakovlev about the "Yakovlev-24" helicopter, and also published a photo of this new helicopter. This helicopter, known as the "Flying Carriage," is the largest of its kind in the world. Usually, the effective payload of foreign helicopters is only one to one and a half tons, with a flying weight of six to six and a half tons. The "Yakovlev-24" is twice as large and heavy as them. Flying this helicopter, pilot Kiniakov reached an altitude of 5,082 meters with two tons of cargo; pilot Miliutichev reached an altitude of more than 2,000 meters with four tons of cargo. These are two world records.
    Socialist Labor Hero Yakovlev said in his interview: This helicopter can land anywhere without a landing field - on mountains, on Arctic ice, and in other difficult locations. It is not only more convenient than other aircraft but also more convenient than automobiles. The Soviet Union manufactures a variety of helicopters. Kamov's small helicopter, carrying only one person, is very light and handy. Mir's medium-sized helicopter has performed excellently in Arctic scientific expeditions and mountain work, and it is also used in agricultural work. The "Yakovlev-24" is a heavy helicopter. Its spacious cargo hold can carry four tons of cargo, enough to fit two small cars. This helicopter has two powerful engines that rotate two four-bladed propellers at the front and rear of the aircraft. The engines are connected by a synchronization shaft. So when one engine fails, the propeller keeps turning and the aircraft continues to fly. The cockpit is fitted with glass, providing a clear view in all directions, especially downwards. The flight crew consists of four people: the first and second pilots, a mechanic, and a radio operator.
    The "Yakovlev-24" helicopter made its first appearance at the Tushino Airport during the Soviet Aviation Day last year.

### “雅科—24”——最大的直升飞机

　　“雅科—24”——最大的直升飞机
    本报莫斯科7日电  “真理报”今天发表了著名飞机设计师雅科夫列夫关于“雅科——24”直升飞机的谈话，并且刊载了这种新的直升飞机的照片。这种被称为“飞行车厢”的直升飞机是世界上同类飞机的最大的一种。通常外国的直升飞机有效载重只一吨到一吨半，而飞行重量为六吨到六吨半。“雅科—24”式飞机的大小和载重比它们大一倍。驾驶这种飞机，飞行员金尼亚科夫带着两吨货物，升到5，082公尺的空中；飞行员米留季切夫带着四吨货物升到两千多公尺的空中。这是两次世界纪录。
    社会主义劳动英雄雅科夫列夫在他的谈话中说：这种直升飞机在没有着陆场的任何地方——山上、北极的冰上和其他难到的场所都可以降落。它不但比别的飞机而且比汽车方便。苏联制造着多种直升飞机。卡莫夫设计的小型直升飞机只乘一个人，非常轻巧。米尔设计的中型直升飞机在北极的科学探险和山地工作中成绩极好，在农业工作中也采用它。“雅科—24”式是重型直升飞机。它的宽敞的货舱能载四吨货物，可以放下两个小汽车。这种直升飞机有两部强大的发动机，它们转动飞机头尾的两部四叶的螺旋桨。发动机用协调轴联接起来。所以当一部发动机发生故障的时候，螺旋桨不停转动，飞机继续飞行。驾驶舱装着玻璃，可以向四面八方，特别是向下了望得清楚。飞行组包括第一和第二飞行员、机械员和无线电联络员四个人。
    “雅科—24”式直升飞机在去年苏联航空节的时候，曾在土希诺机场作了第一次的表演。
