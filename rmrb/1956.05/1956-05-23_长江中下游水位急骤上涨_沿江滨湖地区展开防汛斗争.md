Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 22nd. Flood control efforts have begun in areas along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and surrounding lakes.

	In mid-May, many dikes in the Dongting Lake system in Hunan Province and the Poyang Lake system in Jiangxi Province withstood a peak flood. The people on both sides of the Xiu River, Jin River, and Xin River in Jiangxi Province have twice defeated flood peaks since April 27th by reinforcing the dikes in a timely manner. They are currently stepping up preparations for flood control materials, rectifying flood control teams, and raising and thickening weak dike sections to prepare for larger floods. At the same time, various localities are organizing large forces to drain accumulated water.
	Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangsu provinces are inspecting dikes. In Hubei Province, on many wide and wave-prone dike sections of the Yangtze and Han Rivers, bank protection projects are being stepped up, and stone is being thrown into the river to protect the banks. Protective forests have also been widely planted on the outer slopes of the dikes. Nanjing has also built about four kilometers of waterproof walls along the Yangtze River in Pukou and Xiaguan. At present, these provinces are also stepping up preparations for flood control telecommunications equipment and materials. Many sacks, pilings, soil, sand, and pebbles used for rescue, wave prevention, and flood prevention have been rushed to various important locations.
	The person in charge of water situation forecasting in the Yangtze River Basin told Xinhua News Agency reporters that since entering May, strong northern cold air masses have been continuously blowing into the Yangtze River Basin, and at the same time, it has been affected by the subtropical high pressure in the Sea of Japan. Therefore, rainfall in the Yangtze River Basin has been abundant, especially in the Poyang and Dongting Lake areas, where rainfall is heavy and lasts for a long time, resulting in a sharp rise in river water levels in these areas. From the 18th, the water levels of the Xiang River, Yuan River and other rivers have begun to fall. However, due to the large amount of water in the two lakes, coupled with the recent flood peak in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the water levels in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are generally four or five decimeters higher than in the same period in 1954.
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 22nd. In the past few days, the water levels of the main rivers in Guangdong Province, such as the Dongjiang River, Xijiang River, and Beijiang River, have gradually risen. The Beijiang River once approached the warning water level, entering a tense stage of summer flood control. The flood control headquarters of forty-four counties in the province and the command posts in key flood control areas of each county are vigilantly monitoring the flood situation day and night. On the dikes of Sihui County, which protect more than 100,000 mu of farmland, there is now a dike patrol post every kilometer. The county has also organized a flood control and rescue team of more than 24,000 people. The eight sections of the Qingyuan section of the Beijiang River dike that had problems last year have been reinforced, and seepage diversion ditches have been opened.

	Mass flood control and rescue organizations have been widely established in various places. Each township and agricultural cooperative has flood control brigades and teams, preparing to dispatch at any time. The equipment needed for flood control and rescue has been distributed to various flood control areas. The province has prepared 1.5 million grass bags and nearly 350,000 fir piles, which is much more than last year.

### 长江中下游水位急骤上涨  沿江滨湖地区展开防汛斗争

    长江中下游水位急骤上涨
    沿江滨湖地区展开防汛斗争
    新华社武汉22日电　长江中、下游沿江滨湖地区已经开始了防汛的斗争。
    五月中旬，湖南省洞庭湖水系和江西省鄱阳湖水系的许多堤防，都经受过一次洪峰的考验。江西省修水、锦江和信河两岸人民，由于及时加固堤防，四月二十七日以来曾经先后两次战胜洪峰，目前正在加紧准备防汛物资，整顿防汛队伍，对薄弱堤段加高培厚，准备防御更大的洪水。和这同时，各地还组织大批力量赶排渍水。
    安徽、湖北和江苏等省，正在对堤防进行检查。湖北省在长江、汉水许多江宽浪高的堤段，正在加紧修护岸工程和在江中抛石护岸，堤防的外坡也普遍营造了防护林。南京市浦口、下关长江两岸还修筑了长达四公里左右的防水墙。目前，这几个省对防汛电讯设备和器材的准备工作，也都正在加紧进行。许多用来抢险、防浪和防浸的麻袋、桩木、土砂和卵石等，都已赶运到各个重要地段。
    长江流域水情预报工作的负责人对新华社记者说，进入五月以后，强大的北方冷气团源源吹入长江流域，同时又受日本海副热带高压的影响，因此长江流域雨量丰盛，特别是鄱阳、洞庭湖地区雨量大，持续时间长，这就造成这些地区的河流水位急骤上涨。从十八日起，湘江、沅水等河流水位已经开始回落。但是，由于两湖水量较大，又加上长江上游最近出现了洪峰，因此长江中、下游水位一般都比1954年同期高四、五公寸。
    新华社广州22日电　这几天，广东省内东江、西江、北江等主要河流的水位逐渐上升。北江曾一度接近警戒水位，进入了夏季防汛的紧张阶段。省内四十四个县的防汛指挥部门和各县防汛重点区的指挥所正日夜警惕地注视着汛情。在捍卫着十多万亩农田的四会县堤围上，现在每隔一公里就有一个巡堤哨，全县还组织了一支二万四千多人的防汛抢险队伍。北江大堤清远段去年曾经出险的八个地段已经加固，并且开好了导渗沟。
    各地群众性的防汛抢险组织已普遍建立，各乡各农业社都设有防汛大队、中队，准备着随时出动。防汛抢险所需的器材已经分配到各个防汛地区。全省各地已准备好一百五十万张草包席料和近三十五万根杉桩，比去年增加了许多。
