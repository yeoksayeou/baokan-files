Gansu to Expand Irrigated Area by Five Million Mu

Gansu Province has achieved great success in farmland water conservancy construction this year. By the end of April, it had already exceeded the plan to expand the irrigated area by five million mu. This figure is equivalent to six times the actual irrigated area completed last year.

The water conservancy projects in Gansu Province this year are mostly small and medium-sized, relying on the masses to solve the financial and general technical problems in the projects themselves. Before liberation, Zhuanglang County did not have a single mu of irrigated land. This year, more than one-third of the county's male and female full and semi-labor force participated in water conservancy construction projects. The original plan was to build 4,000 mu of irrigated land, but 150,000 mu were completed. (Our reporter stationed in Lanzhou)

　　甘肃将扩大水地面积五百万亩
    甘肃省今年的农田水利修建工程获得很大成绩。在四月底已经提前超额完成扩大水地面积五百万亩的计划。这个数字相当于去年实际完成的水地面积的六倍。
    甘肃省今年的水利工程，绝大部分是中小型的，依靠群众自己动手解决资金和工程中的一般技术问题。庄浪县在解放前后，一亩水地也没有，今年全县三分之一以上的男女全劳动力和半劳动力都参加了水利兴修工程，原计划修四千亩水地，结果完成了十五万亩。（本报驻兰州记者）
