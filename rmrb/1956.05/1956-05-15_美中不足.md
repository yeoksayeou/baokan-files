The Jinan Automobile Parts Factory overfulfilled the first quarter's national plan by nineteen days, with seven out of eight indicators being overfulfilled, and the product quality was very good. It is a pity that the variety plan was not completed. The first quarter's plan required the trial production of sixteen new products, but only four were completed. This is truly "a fly in the ointment."

The reason why the trial production of new products did not meet the target is that the factory leaders did not pay enough attention to the trial production of new products. They believed that completing the original production tasks was more important, and it did not matter whether the trial production of new products was completed or not. Under the influence of this thinking, after the workshop assigned the new product plan to the work section, it no longer paid attention to it; the work section treated the trial production of new products as a "gap filler," doing it when the lathe was free and postponing it when it was not. Some workshops even forgot about the new product trial production plan when arranging the plan.

To achieve socialist industrialization, it is not enough to only produce what we already know how to produce. We must quickly learn and be able to produce in large quantities what we cannot yet manufacture. Only in this way can we meet the needs of social development and people's lives. And only in this way can employees learn and master new technologies in the process of trial production and production of new products, so as to improve the technical level of enterprises. Therefore, trial production of new products is an important part of the development of China's industry, and enterprise leaders must not ignore the trial production of new products.

    “美中不足”
    济南汽车配件厂提前十九天超额完成了第一季度国家计划，八项指标超额完成了七项，产品质量很好。可惜品种计划没有完成，第一季度计划要试制十六种新产品，只完成了四种。这真是“美中不足”。
    新产品试制没有达到指标，是因为这个厂的领导上对试制新产品工作不重视，他们认为完成原有生产任务要紧，新产品试制完成完不成没什么。在这种思想影响下，车间把新产品计划下达到工段后，就再不过问了；工段也就把新产品试制当作“补空子”，车床有了空就干，没有空就往后拖。有的车间甚至在安排计划的时候，竟把新产品试制计划忘掉了。
    我们要实现社会主义工业化，光生产我们已经会生产的东西还不够，必须迅速地学会并且能够大批生产我们现在还不会制造的东西。只有这样，才能够适应社会发展和人民生活的需要。并且也才能使职工从试制和生产新产品的过程中，学习和掌握新技术，以提高企业的技术水平。因此，试制新产品是我国工业发展的重要一环，企业领导者绝不能忽视新产品的试制工作。
