Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 22nd - A new method of promoting advanced experiences has recently emerged on construction sites in Wuhan: signing contracts to promote advanced experiences.

    In the First, Second, and Third Construction Engineering Companies of Central South alone, workers from thirty production teams and groups with the same type of work have signed such contracts with each other. The five bricklayer groups led by Dai Libin and the four carpenter groups led by Sun Yaoming, who were the first to sign such contracts, have already begun exchanging advanced experiences such as the Maletsev shovel, advanced bricklaying methods, and the single-person double push plane, which has generally improved work efficiency.

    The signing of contracts to promote advanced experiences was first proposed by Dai Libin, a well-known advanced producer and bricklayer in Wuhan. These contracts stipulate that any team or group participating in the contract shall promptly exchange and promote any advanced experience, regardless of size. The party creating the advanced experience guarantees to teach the advanced experience well by means of on-the-spot demonstrations or sending people out to impart knowledge; the party learning the advanced experience guarantees to learn, promote and use it well. The contract also stipulates projects for promoting and studying existing advanced experiences within a certain period, mutual observation during holidays, and regular monthly summaries and inspections of the promotion situation.

    签订推广先进经验的合同
    新华社武汉22日电　武汉市基本建设工地上，最近出现了一种推广先进经验的新方法——签订推广先进经验的合同。
    仅在中南第一、第二和第三建筑工程公司所属的各个工地上，已经有三十个工种相同的生产队、组的工人，相互签订了这种合同。最早签订这种合同的戴礼彬等五个泥工小组和孙耀明等四个木工小组，目前已经开始交流了马列采夫锹、先进砌墙法以及单人双推刨等先进经验，使工作效率得到普遍提高。
    签订推广先进经验合同是由武汉市著名的先进生产者、泥工戴礼彬首先提出的。这种合同中规定：凡参加签订合同的任何一个队、组，一有先进经验，不论大小，都要及时交流、推广。创造先进经验的一方，保证采取就地表演或派人出去传授的方法教好先进经验；学习先进经验的一方，保证学好和推广使用。合同中还规定了在一定时期内推广和研究已有先进经验的项目，利用假日相互观摩，并且每月定期总结和检查推广情况等内容。
