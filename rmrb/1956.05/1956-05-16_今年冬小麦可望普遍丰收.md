Xinhua News Agency, 15th: A widespread bumper harvest of winter wheat is expected this year. This is the first significant victory on the agricultural production front brought about by the high tide of agricultural cooperativization across the country.

    Winter wheat in the southern provinces has been harvested one after another. The average yield per mu in Guangxi Province exceeded the plan by about ten jin. Many areas in Fujian Province have achieved unprecedented bumper harvests; Longxi Special District, one of the province's main producing areas, saw its total output increase by about three times compared to last year. Sichuan, Yunnan, Zhejiang and other provinces increased production by about 10-20% compared to last year. Guizhou Province also overfulfilled its plan.

    In the main wheat-producing areas of the Yellow River, Huai River basin and along the Yangtze River, winter wheat is growing well and a bumper harvest is expected. According to typical surveys conducted in Henan Province in different regions such as the Huaibei Plain, the Yubei Irrigation Area, and the Nanyang Basin, yields are generally expected to increase compared to last year. In the Jiaoji Railway area of ​​Shandong Province, it is estimated that each mu will yield about 150 jin; Huang County estimates that each mu will reach about 300 jin. Jiangsu Province estimates an increase of about 20% compared to last year. Winter wheat in the Jinan area of ​​Shanxi Province is growing the best it has in nearly 20 years, and it is expected that each mu will produce more than 130 jin, an increase of about 10% compared to last year. It is estimated that the average yield per mu in the Qinchuan area of ​​Shaanxi Province can reach about 300 jin. Hebei Province can also complete its planned production increase targets. It is estimated that winter wheat in Gansu and Anhui provinces will also increase production.
