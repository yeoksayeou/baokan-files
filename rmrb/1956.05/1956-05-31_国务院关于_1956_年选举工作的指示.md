The Eighth Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress decided on March 10, 1955, that the election of deputies to the second people's congresses of municipalities directly under the Central Government, counties, cities, municipal districts, townships, ethnic townships, and towns shall be handled uniformly in 1956. At present, our country's socialist revolution is entering a high tide. Carrying out election work under this new situation should give the people a profound education in socialist democracy, further stimulate their enthusiasm for participating in national construction and national management, and replenish state organs with new forces, thereby further promoting socialist construction and the socialist transformation cause. Now, the following instructions are given regarding the election work to be carried out in municipalities directly under the Central Government, counties, cities, municipal districts, townships, ethnic townships, and towns this year:

I. Local people's committees at all levels should properly arrange the time for election work and other central tasks, and should concentrate their efforts to complete the election work in a relatively short period of time. According to the decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, grass-roots election work will generally be carried out between July and November. The election work for deputies to the people's congresses of municipalities directly under the Central Government, counties, cities, districts under cities, townships, ethnic townships, and towns can be prepared and carried out simultaneously and in a coordinated manner. When determining the number of deputies to the people's congresses of districts under cities, townships, ethnic townships, and towns, municipalities directly under the Central Government, counties, and cities should simultaneously determine the number of deputies to the people's congresses of municipalities directly under the Central Government, counties, and cities, and allocate them to districts under cities, townships, ethnic townships, and towns, so that districts under cities, townships, ethnic townships, and towns can elect deputies to the next higher level people's congress at the first meeting of the second people's congress. Municipalities directly under the Central Government, counties, and cities can then convene the first meeting of the second people's congress immediately. The first meeting of the second people's congresses of municipalities directly under the Central Government, counties, and cities should be held no later than the end of December 1956.

II. In accordance with the provisions of the Organic Law of the Local People's Congresses and Local People's Committees at All Levels, the election of deputies to the local people's congresses at all levels shall be presided over by the people's committees at the corresponding levels. Municipalities directly under the Central Government, counties, cities, districts under cities, townships, ethnic townships, and towns should all establish election committees under the leadership of the people's committees to be responsible for handling all specific tasks related to the election. Provinces and autonomous regions may establish election work offices to guide and supervise the election work of lower levels. After the establishment of election organizations at all levels, they should immediately formulate election work plans, convene meetings, deploy work, and combine these meetings with training cadres. Election organizations above the county level should be responsible for balancing the number of deputies to the people's congresses among the counties under their jurisdiction and between counties or between townships, as well as for preparing the election budget.

III. Grass-roots election work should still be handled in accordance with the Electoral Law of the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses at All Levels and with reference to the various principles stipulated in the instructions of the Central Election Committee on grass-roots election work in 1953. In specific practices, it is necessary to adapt to the current situation and strive for simplicity and practicality. All activities of grass-roots elections should be carried out as much as possible by utilizing production gaps or in combination with production, and strive to complete the election work of a grass-roots unit in about twenty days.

In order to adapt to the new situation of the rapid development of agricultural cooperation and various socialist transformation undertakings in cities, as well as the corresponding improvement of the people's political and cultural levels, the election work in 1956 should pay special attention to the following aspects:

(1) Grass-roots election work should achieve three specific requirements: (1) Do a good job in reviewing the qualifications of voters, so that no one who should have the right to vote is wrongly deprived of the solemn right to vote, and no one who should not have the right to vote steals the solemn right to vote; (2) Mobilize voters to consciously and enthusiastically participate in the election, so that the number of voters participating in the election is generally higher than the proportion of local voters participating in the election during the first national general election; (3) Do a good job in electing representatives, and elect advanced representatives in socialist construction and the socialist transformation movement, as well as representative figures in other aspects, into the organs of state power.

(2) Electoral districts and voter groups should be divided according to the specific conditions of different regions. In rural areas, based on the production unit, one or several cooperatives should be divided into one electoral district according to the size of the agricultural production cooperative; large cooperatives can divide electoral districts according to the residential areas of the production teams; voters who have not yet joined the cooperative are assigned to the nearest electoral district. In cities, electoral districts are divided based on the residential areas of voters, and one or several electoral districts are divided according to the size of the jurisdiction of the street offices; larger factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, schools, and other units that can produce more than one representative can be divided into a separate electoral district, and those that are not enough to produce one representative can be combined with neighboring units or with local residents to form an electoral district. Pastoral, forestry, and water areas should proceed from facilitating production and facilitating voters' participation in election activities, and divide electoral districts according to local specific conditions.

(3) Voter registration and voter qualification review should be carried out on the basis of the registration and review work carried out during the first national general election, adopting the method of universal registration and key review. Voter registration can be checked against the original voter registration forms to remove voters who have married out, moved out, or died, as well as those who have been legally deprived of their right to vote during this period; then add voters who have married in, moved in, and have reached the age of eighteen, as well as those who have been legally restored to their right to vote. The time for calculating the age of voters who have reached the age of eighteen shall be based on the date of the local election. The focus of reviewing voter qualifications should be on those who need to be legally granted or deprived of the right to vote. After the voter qualification review is determined, the voter registration form should be filled out again, voter certificates should be issued, and the list of voters should be announced. When anyone raises different opinions on the announced voter list, they should be fully guaranteed to exercise the right to appeal and sue.

(4) The nomination of candidates for representatives should adopt a method that combines guided joint nomination and voter nomination. Before the joint nomination, the members of the local Communist Party, various democratic parties, people's organizations, and production cooperatives should first widely deliberate among the voters to gather opinions; then the election committee invites representatives from these aspects to negotiate and propose a preliminary list of candidates for representatives, which is submitted to the voters for discussion, and seriously revised and supplemented according to the opinions of the majority of voters; finally, the election committee announces the official list of candidates for representatives before the election. Voters who still have different opinions on the announced official list of candidates for representatives can elect any other voter they are willing to elect during the election.

The election method must strive to facilitate the masses. In rural areas, an election meeting should be held according to the electoral district; in cities, polling stations should generally be set up in sections according to the different production and working hours of voters; for voters who cannot participate in the election meeting or go to the polling station to vote, methods such as mobile ballot boxes can also be used for voters to vote on the spot.

(5) Hold the first meeting of the second people's congresses of grass-roots units. The main agenda of this meeting should be: elect the members of the people's committee at the current level and the representatives to the people's congress at the next higher level; review the work of the people's committee at the previous level; discuss and resolve the major problems that the masses most urgently need to solve; according to the provisions of the Organic Law of the Local People's Congresses and Local People's Committees at All Levels, establish a system for representatives to regularly contact voters, and in combination with local practical needs, rectify and improve the various organizations and systems of the people's committee, so as to fully promote democracy and consolidate the results of the election.

IV. The people's congresses of autonomous prefectures (leagues, administrative regions) and autonomous counties should conduct elections in accordance with the provisions of these instructions, except for those established this year, which may not be re-elected; those that are being prepared for establishment may be established in conjunction with this election. Whether or not to implement universal suffrage in minority areas that have not yet implemented universal suffrage and convened people's congresses this year shall be proposed by the people's committees of the relevant provinces and autonomous regions and reported to the State Council for approval.

    国务院关于1956年选举工作的指示
    1955年3月10日，全国人民代表大会常务委员会第八次会议决定，直辖市、县、市、市辖区、乡、民族乡和镇的第二届人民代表大会代表的选举，一律在1956年办理。目前正是我国社会主义革命进入高潮的时期。在这一新形势下进行选举工作，应该使人民群众受到一次深刻的社会主义民主教育，更加激发起参加国家建设和国家管理的积极性，并且使国家机关补充新生力量，从而进一步推动社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的前进。现在，对直辖市、县、市、市辖区、乡、民族乡和镇在今年内进行的选举工作，作如下指示：
    一、地方各级人民委员会应该妥善地安排选举工作和其他各项中心工作的时间，并且应该集中力量，争取用较短时间做好选举工作。按照全国人民代表大会常务委员会的决定，基层选举工作一般在七月至十一月间进行。直辖市、县、设区的市和不设区的市、市辖区、乡、民族乡、镇两级人民代表大会代表的选举工作，可以同时准备，衔接进行。直辖市、县、设区的市在确定市辖区、乡、民族乡、镇人民代表大会代表名额的时候，应该同时确定直辖市、县、设区的市人民代表大会代表名额，并且分配到市辖区、乡、民族乡、镇，以便市辖区、乡、民族乡、镇在第二届人民代表大会的第一次会议上就可以选出出席上一级人民代表大会代表；直辖市、县、设区的市就可以紧接着召开第二届人民代表大会第一次会议。直辖市、县、市第二届人民代表大会的第一次会议，至迟应该在1956年12月底以前举行。
    二、依据地方各级人民代表大会和地方各级人民委员会组织法的规定，地方各级人民代表大会代表的选举，由本级人民委员会主持。直辖市、县、市、市辖区、乡、民族乡、镇都应该在人民委员会领导下建立选举委员会，负责办理有关选举的各项具体工作。省、自治区可以设立选举工作办公室，指导和督促下级的选举工作。各级选举机构建立以后，应该立即制定选举工作计划，召开会议，部署工作，并且结合这种会议，训练干部。县以上的选举机构，应该负责平衡所属县和县或者乡和乡之间人民代表大会代表名额的工作，以及编造选举经费预算的工作。
    三、基层选举工作，仍然应该依据全国人民代表大会及地方各级人民代表大会选举法和参照1953年中央选举委员会关于基层选举工作的指示中规定的各项原则办理。在具体作法上，必须适应当前情况，力求简便和切合实际。基层选举的一切活动，应该尽量利用生产空隙或者结合生产去进行，并且争取在二十天左右完成一个基层单位的选举工作。
    为了适应农业合作化和城市各项社会主义改造事业迅速发展以及人民群众政治、文化水平业已相应提高的新情况，1956年的选举工作应该特别注意以下几个方面：
    （一）基层选举工作应该实现三项具体要求：（1）做好选民资格审查工作，不让一个应该有选举权利的人被错误地剥夺了庄严的选举权利，也不让一个不应该有选举权利的人窃取了庄严的选举权利；（2）发动选民自觉地热烈地参加选举，做到参加选举的选民人数一般高于全国第一次普选时当地选民参加选举的比例；（3）做好选举代表的工作，把社会主义建设和社会主义改造运动中的先进代表人物以及在其他方面有代表性的人物，选举到政权组织中来。
    （二）选区和选民小组应该根据不同地区的具体情况划分。农村以生产单位为基础，按照农业生产合作社的大小，就一个社或者几个社划成一个选区；大社可以按照生产队的居住地区划分选区；还没有入社的选民划入就近的选区。城市以选民居住地区为基础，按照街道办事处管辖范围的大小，划分成一个或者几个选区；较大的厂矿、企业、机关、学校等单位，能够产生一名以上代表的可以单独划成一个选区，不够产生一名代表的可以由邻近的几个单位或者同当地居民合起来划成一个选区。牧业、林业和水上等地区，应该从便利生产、便利选民参加选举活动出发，根据当地具体情况划分选区。
    （三）选民登记和选民资格审查应该在全国第一次普选时办理登记审查工作的基础上，采取普遍登记、重点审查的方式进行。选民登记可以用原有的选民登记表册核对，把其中婚出、迁出、死亡的选民以及这一时期依法剥夺了选举权利的人划掉；再把婚入、迁入和业已年满十八岁的选民以及依法恢复了选举权利的人补上。计算年满十八岁选民年龄的时间，以当地进行选举的日期为标准。审查选民资格的重点应该是需要依法给予选举权利或者剥夺选举权利的人。选民资格审查确定以后，应该重行填写选民登记表册，填发选民证，并且公布选民名单。不论任何人对于公布的选民名单提出不同意见的时候，都应该充分保障他们行使申诉和诉讼的权利。
    （四）代表候选人的提名应该采取有领导地联合提名和选民提名相结合的方式。在联合提名以前，首先通过当地共产党、各民主党派、各人民团体和生产合作社的成员，在选民中广泛酝酿，把意见集中起来；再由选举委员会邀请这些方面的代表协商，提出代表候选人初步名单，交选民讨论，并且依据多数选民的意见，加以认真的修改和补充；最后由选举委员会在选举以前公布代表候选人的正式名单。对于公布的代表候选人正式名单仍有不同意见的选民，在选举的时候，可以另选自己愿意选的其他任何选民。
    选举的方法必须力求便利群众。在农村，应该按照选区召开选举大会；在城市，一般应该根据选民不同的生产和工作时间，按照选区分段设立投票站进行选举；对不能参加选举大会和到投票站选举的选民，还可以采用流动票箱由选民就地选举等办法。
    （五）开好基层单位第二届人民代表大会第一次会议。这次会议的主要议程应该是：选出本届本级人民委员会的组成人员和出席上一级人民代表大会的代表；审查上届本级人民委员会的工作；讨论解决群众当前最迫切需要解决的重大问题；根据地方各级人民代表大会和地方各级人民委员会组织法的规定，建立代表固定联系选民的制度，并且结合当地实际需要，整顿和健全人民委员会的各种组织、制度，以充分发扬民主，巩固选举的成果。
    四、自治州（盟、行政区）和自治县人民代表大会除今年建立起来的可以不再进行选举外，都应该按照本指示的规定进行选举；正在准备建立的，可以结合这次选举建立起来。没有实行普选召开人民代表大会的少数民族地区，今年是否实行普选，由各有关省、自治区人民委员会提出意见，报告国务院批准。
        国务院总理　周恩来
                    1956年5月28日
