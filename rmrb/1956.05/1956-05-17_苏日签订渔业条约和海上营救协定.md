Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 15th: Communiqué on the results of the Soviet-Japanese negotiations on fishing issues and rescuing victims at sea.

From April 29th to May 14th, Soviet and Japanese delegations held negotiations in Moscow on fishing issues in the Northwest Pacific region and the rescue of victims at sea.

The head of the Soviet delegation was A. Ishkov, Minister of Fisheries of the Soviet Union, and the head of the Japanese delegation was Ichiro Kono, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry of Japan.

During the negotiations, the two sides thoroughly discussed various issues related to adjusting fishing matters in the Northwest Pacific region. Both sides believed that corresponding and mutually agreed upon measures must be taken to maintain the largest and most stable fish yield of the fish to be caught (including Far Eastern salmon).

The negotiations were conducted in an atmosphere of understanding and sincerity. Finally, on May 14, 1956, the Fishery Treaty and the Maritime Rescue Agreement were signed.

The treaty and agreement stipulate that they will come into effect from the date of the entry into force of the peace treaty or from the date of the resumption of Soviet-Japanese diplomatic relations.

To this end, Ishkov and Kono exchanged views on the issue of normalizing relations and agreed that in order for the treaty and agreement to take effect quickly, negotiations on the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations must be resumed in the near future, no later than July 31, 1956.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 16th: The Soviet-Japanese Fishery Treaty and Maritime Rescue Agreement have been welcomed by all sectors of Japan.

Fishermen, boat owners, and their families in many fishing ports in Hokkaido and northern Honshu, Japan, drank to celebrate the success of the fishery negotiations on May 15th.

Japan's largest newspapers, "Asahi Shimbun" and "Mainichi Shimbun," unanimously commented today that the signing of the treaty focuses people's attention on the issue of normalizing Japanese-Soviet relations that needs to be resolved. Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, pointed out that Japan should adjust its national relations with the Soviet Union as soon as possible. In order for the treaty and agreement to take effect as soon as possible, the Dai Nippon Fisheries Association has decided to launch a campaign for the early signing of a Soviet-Japanese peace treaty.

The signing of the treaty and agreement has also aroused positive reactions among some Japanese government officials. Chief Cabinet Secretary Ryutaro Nemoto believes that this negotiation has opened the way for resuming the normalization negotiations of Japanese-Soviet relations that have been interrupted.

    新华社16日讯　塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：苏联和日本关于捕鱼问题和援救海上遇难者问题的谈判结果公报。
    苏联和日本两国代表团从四月二十九日起到五月十四日止在莫斯科举行了关于在太平洋西北地区捕鱼问题和援救海上遇难者问题的谈判。
    苏联代表团团长是苏联渔业部部长亚·伊什科夫，日本代表团团长是日本农林相河野一郎。
    在谈判过程中，双方详细地讨论了同调整太平洋西北地区捕鱼事宜有关的各种问题，双方认为必须采取相应的一致同意的措施，以便保持所要捕捉的鱼（其中包括远东鲑鱼）的最大的、稳定的鱼产量。
    谈判是在谅解和真诚的气氛中进行的。最后在1956年5月14日签订了渔业条约和海上营救协定。
    条约和协定中规定，它们将从和约生效之日起或者苏日外交关系恢复之日起开始生效。
    为此，伊什科夫和河野就关系正常化问题交换了意见，并且同意：为了使条约和协定迅速生效，必须在最近期内、不迟于1956年7月31日恢复苏日关系正常化的谈判。

    据新华社16日讯　东京消息：苏联同日本签订的渔业条约和海上营救协定，受到日本各界的欢迎。
    日本北海道和本州北部的许多渔港的渔船主、渔民和他们的家属，在五月十五日饮酒祝贺渔业谈判的成功。
    日本最大的报纸“朝日新闻”和“每日新闻”今天一致评论说，条约的签订使得人们的注意力集中在需要解决日苏关系正常化的问题上。社会党总书记浅沼指出，日本应该早日同苏联调整邦交。为了使条约和协定早日生效，大日本水产会已经决定发动一次早日签订苏日和约的运动。
    条约和协定的签订在日本政府一些官员中也引起了积极的反应。内阁官房长官根本龙太郎认为，这次谈判打开了恢复已经中断的日苏关系正常化谈判的道路。
