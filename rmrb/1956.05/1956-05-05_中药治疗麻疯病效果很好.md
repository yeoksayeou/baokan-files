Traditional Chinese Medicine is Highly Effective in Treating Leprosy

The use of traditional Chinese medicine to treat leprosy, a disease once considered dangerous and incurable, has proven to be very effective. This has been demonstrated by the clinical observation of 309 patients at the Liaoning Province Leprosy Hospital.

Over the past nine months, the Liaoning Province Leprosy Hospital, targeting the different conditions of 309 out of 372 hospitalized patients, has continuously used several prescriptions for treating leprosy recorded in the traditional Chinese medicine literature "Medical Golden Mirror" and five clinical empirical formulas such as "Kushen Powder," under the cooperation of traditional Chinese medicine doctors and Western medicine doctors. As of March 15th, observation of the patients' symptoms showed that the treatment was 99% effective. According to bacterial and tissue section examinations performed on the patients, the proven effective rates also reached 83.5% and 81.58% respectively.

Recently, the Ministry of Health specially sent personnel to the Liaoning Province Leprosy Hospital to investigate and summarize the findings.
