Rely on the Masses to Formulate a Comprehensive Production Plan

    The Luoyang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Panyu County, Guangdong Province, estimates that each work day can have an income of more than one yuan this year because it has developed diversified operations and sideline production.

    Last year, the Luoyang Agricultural Production Cooperative misunderstood the principle of "increasing grain production as the main focus" as simply increasing the production of staple grains. As a result, many lands that could have developed diversified operations were not utilized, and some cooperative members with expertise in sideline production did not play their roles. This spring, after mobilizing cooperative members to put forward rationalization proposals, a plan for developing diversified operations and sideline production was formulated. The entire cooperative planted crops such as sugarcane, sorghum, beans, and fruit trees on 834 mu of land; and organized cooperative members with specialized skills to carry out production work such as animal husbandry, ironwork, and bamboo weaving. At present, this cooperative has raised 2,600 pigs, 2,800 ducks, 50 sheep, 14 dairy cows, and 54 calves. (Huang Xiangqing)

    依靠群众订出全面生产计划
    广东省番禺县螺阳农业生产合作社，因为今年开展了多种经营、发展了副业生产，估计每一个劳动日可以有一元以上的收入。
    螺阳农业生产合作社去年把“增产粮食为主”的方针误解为单纯增产主粮，因此，有许多可以发展多种经营的土地没有利用，一部分有副业生产专长的社员也没有发挥作用。今年春天，发动社员提合理化建议后，订出了一个发展多种经营和副业生产的计划。全社在834亩地里种了甘蔗、高粱、豆类、果树等作物；并组织有专长技术的社员分别进行畜牧、打铁、编织竹器等生产工作。目前，这个社已养猪二千六百头、养鸭二千八百只、羊五十头、奶牛十四头、小牛五十四头。　（黄向青）
