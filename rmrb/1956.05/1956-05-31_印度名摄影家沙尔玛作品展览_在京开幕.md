The opening ceremony of the "Exhibition of Works by Renowned Indian Photographer Sharma" was held at the Waterside Pavilion in Zhongshan Park, Beijing, at 10:00 AM on the 30th. Among those attending the opening ceremony were Ding Xilin, President of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association; R.K. Nehru, the Indian Ambassador to China, and his wife; the renowned Indian photographer Sharma; as well as individuals from the capital's cultural and artistic circles, Chinese and foreign journalists, and personnel from various foreign embassies in China, totaling more than 150 people.

At the ceremony, Ding Xilin, President of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, introduced Sharma's creative activities and his achievements in the field of photography. Also speaking at the ceremony were the Indian Ambassador's wife and the renowned Indian photographer Sharma, who both believed that the exhibition would help to further strengthen the historic friendship between the peoples of China and India.

The exhibition features ninety works by the renowned Indian photographer Sharma, most of which reflect various aspects of India's long-standing culture, art, and people's lives. Sharma's portraits and photographs of Indian scenery are extremely beautiful and outstanding. His "Indian Mother" is a portrayal of the hardworking and kind Indian people. This photograph is relatively perfect both in the depiction of the character's expression and in its composition. His other photographs depicting Indian scenery also have strong Indian regional and folk customs characteristics, thus attracting more attention from the audience, enabling them to have a broader understanding of all aspects of India. In Sharma's works, there are also some relatively new subjects, such as "Rural Workers Visiting Farmer Families" and "North India's Bhakra Dam Project," which allow us to further understand the achievements made by the Indian people in building their country.

After the exhibition in Beijing, it will also tour Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan and other places. (Attached picture)

    “印度名摄影家沙尔玛作品展览”在京开幕
    “印度名摄影家沙尔玛作品展览”三十日上午十时在北京中山公园水榭举行揭幕式。参加揭幕式的有中印友好协会会长丁西林、印度驻中国大使拉·库·尼赫鲁和夫人、印度名摄影家沙尔玛以及首都文化艺术界人士、中外新闻记者和各国驻华使馆人员一百五十多人。
    会上，中印友好协会会长丁西林介绍了沙尔玛创作活动的概况和他在摄影事业上的成就。在会上发言的还有印度大使夫人和印度名摄影家沙尔玛，他们都认为这次展出将有助于进一步加强中印两国人民的历史性的友谊。
    这次展出的印度名摄影家沙尔玛的作品共有九十幅，其中大部分作品反映了具有悠久历史的印度文化艺术和人民生活的各个方面。沙尔玛拍摄的肖像和印度的风物照片都是极其优美和出色的，他的“印度母亲”就是一幅勤劳、善良的印度人民的写照，这幅照片不论在人物神态的刻划上和构图上都是比较完美的；他的另一部分描绘印度风物的照片也都具有浓厚的印度地方和人民习俗的特色，因此就更加吸引观众的注意，使观众对印度的各个方面有了更广泛的了解。在沙尔玛的作品中，还有一些比较新鲜的题材，如“农村工作者访问农民家庭”和“北印巴克拉水闸工程”等，这些作品使我们进一步了解到印度人民在建设自己的国家中所取得的成就。
    展览会在北京展出结束后，还将到上海、广州和武汉等地巡回展出。（附图片）
