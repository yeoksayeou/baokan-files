How to Conduct Criticism and Self-Criticism at Party Congresses
Chen Yunpeng

Before the end of April this year, Party organizations in various cities, counties, and enterprises in Heilongjiang Province held Party Congresses. Many Party Congresses encountered the same problem: they could not fully展开 [zhǎnkāi - unfold] criticism and self-criticism, or even could not展开 [zhǎnkāi - unfold] it at all. Does this mean that the work of the Party committees at all levels has been done perfectly? Is there nothing to criticize? Of course not. In fact, there are still many shortcomings and errors in the work of the Party committees, and the comrades below are not without opinions on the work and the leadership. The main reason is that everyone still has various ideological concerns about carrying out criticism and self-criticism, especially criticism from below. Some comrades are afraid of offending people, making it difficult to get along in the future; some feel that they do not know enough about the work of the Party committee and are afraid of criticizing incorrectly; some are afraid that if they make suggestions, they will not be accepted or even be subjected to retaliation, and so on. Does this mean that it is fundamentally impossible to fully展開 [zhǎnkāi - unfold] criticism and self-criticism at the Party Congress at present? Of course not. As long as the presidium of the representative大会 [dàhuì - assembly, congress, convention] and the previous党委 [dāngwěi - Party committee] fully发扬 [fāyáng - develop, promote] democracy, criticism and self-criticism can still be fully展开 [zhǎnkāi - unfold].

The report made by the previous 党委 [dāngwěi - Party committee] to the representative大会 [dàhuì - assembly, congress, convention] should boldly expose and criticize the shortcomings and errors in its work, which will greatly promote the展开 [zhǎnkāi - unfold] of criticism and self-criticism at the大会 [dàhuì - assembly, congress, convention]. If the previous党委 [dāngwěi - Party committee] makes self-criticism, it can make everyone feel that the previous党委 [dāngwěi - Party committee] is not afraid to admit shortcomings and errors, and is sincere in listening to everyone's criticism and opinions. If there is no self-criticism in the work report of the previous党委 [dāngwěi - Party committee], and only the presidium of the会议 [huìyì - meeting, conference] calls on everyone to offer opinions, then criticism and self-criticism at the大会 [dàhuì - assembly, congress, convention] cannot be展开 [zhǎnkāi - unfold]ed. This was the case at the Party Congresses of various cities, counties, and enterprises in Heilongjiang this time. Here are two obvious examples. When the previous County党委 [xiàn dāngwěi - county Party committee] of Muleng County made a work report to the Party Congress, it was able to more profoundly expose its own conservative ideology in leadership work from all aspects, analyze the root causes of conservative ideology, and put forward ways to overcome it. For example, in leading this year's agricultural production increase campaign, the County党委 [xiàn dāngwěi - county Party committee] still used the perspective of small-scale peasant economy to look at the collective economy. Although it also set a plan to increase production by 158 *jin* per hectare compared with last year, it always felt unsure. In fact, this indicator was not high and could be achieved. After listening to the report of the County党委 [xiàn dāngwěi - county Party committee], the representatives naturally展开 [zhǎnkāi - unfold]ed criticism and self-criticism. The situation at the Party Congress of the Langxiang Forest Industry 党委 [dāngwěi - Party committee] was just the opposite. In the report made by the previous 党委 [dāngwěi - Party committee] to the Party Congress, the shortcomings in the leadership work of the enterprise 党委 [dāngwěi - Party committee] were only mentioned in general and abstract terms, and no specific improvement methods were put forward. On the contrary, this report excessively criticized general Party members and lower-level organizations, and asked everyone to conduct self-criticism at the大会 [dàhuì - assembly, congress, convention]. The reason why this 党委 [dāngwěi - Party committee] did this was because it felt that "the focus of criticism at this representative大会 [dàhuì - assembly, congress, convention] should be placed on the lower levels, not on the 党委 [dāngwěi - Party committee]." This understanding and approach are incorrect. Without examining the shortcomings and errors in the work of the previous 党委 [dāngwěi - Party committee], the shortcomings and errors in the work of general Party members and lower-level Party organizations cannot be well overcome and corrected. At the same time, the shortcomings and errors of lower-level Party organizations and general Party members are not unrelated to the leadership of the 党委 [dāngwěi - Party committee]. Therefore, only criticizing the lower levels without examining the upper levels will not only fail to thoroughly solve the problem, but also easily arouse dissatisfaction among lower-level organizations and general Party members. At the Party Congress of Langxiang Forest Industry, some people said, "The 党委 [dāngwěi - Party committee] does not examine its own shortcomings, but criticizes us!" Later, members of the previous 党委 [dāngwěi - Party committee] examined their own shortcomings and errors in their speeches at the大会 [dàhuì - assembly, congress, convention], which gradually展开 [zhǎnkāi - unfold]ed the criticism and self-criticism of the大会 [dàhuì - assembly, congress, convention].

Guiding the focus of criticism to the main issues is also an important way to展开 [zhǎnkāi - unfold] criticism and self-criticism at the大会 [dàhuì - assembly, congress, convention]. The Party Congress of Muleng County did a good job in this regard. They took overcoming conservative ideology and striving to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule as the center of the大会 [dàhuì - assembly, congress, convention]. Whether it was the work report of the previous党委 [dāngwěi - Party committee] or the speeches of the representatives, they exposed and criticized conservative ideology from all aspects of agricultural production, local industry, Party's ideological construction, and organizational construction. After such discussions, the representatives felt that their thoughts were clear, everyone's understanding was unified, and their confidence in completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule was enhanced. Some Party Congresses did not pay attention to this issue, and as a result, everyone discussed it in general terms or only raised some trivial issues. For example, at the Party Congress of some counties, the representatives only raised some opinions such as: "There are too few basketball hoops, and the staff can't play enough, which is a manifestation of the County党委 [xiàn dāngwěi - county Party committee]'s lack of concern for the health of the staff." "There is only one bathhouse in the county town, and people have to queue up to take a bath. The bathhouse is unhygienic. Why doesn't the County党委 [xiàn dāngwěi - county Party committee] think of a solution?" In this way, everyone's attention was diverted to some trivial issues, and they could not concentrate their efforts to discuss the main issues. Some comrades may say that since Party members have the right to criticize the shortcomings and errors in any work of the Party at the Party's meetings, wouldn't the presidium of the大会 [dàhuì - assembly, congress, convention]'s guiding the representatives to展开 [zhǎnkāi - unfold] discussions around the main issues restrict the criticism of the representatives? No, concentrating efforts to discuss the main issues is to mobilize everyone to conduct criticism and self-criticism around the main issues, and it is not to prohibit everyone from raising opinions in other aspects. It should be made clear to the representatives that the Party Congress is the highest leading organ of the Party, and it should concentrate its efforts to discuss and solve the most important issues in the Party's work. General issues can be raised at daily Party meetings for discussion. Facts have proved that as long as the truth is explained to everyone, as long as everyone's发言 [fāyán - speech, statement] is not restricted, it can not only ensure that the大会 [dàhuì - assembly, congress, convention] concentrates its efforts to solve the main problems, but also will not affect everyone's enthusiasm.

Of course, it is not enough to展開 [zhǎnkāi - unfold] criticism only at the Party Congress. The next 党委 [dāngwěi - Party committee] and Party organizations at all levels must earnestly improve their work based on everyone's criticisms and suggestions. Otherwise, if the criticisms at the Party Congress do not play a role in actual work, then everyone will have new concerns about展开 [zhǎnkāi - unfold]ing criticism, and both the Party's regular democratic life and the future development of democracy at the Party Congresses will be greatly affected.

    怎样在党代表大会上开展批评和自我批评
    陈云鹏
    今年四月底以前，黑龙江省各市、县以及企业党组织先后举行了党的代表大会。不少党代表大会碰到了一个同样的问题：不能充分展开批评和自我批评，甚至根本展不开。是不是各级党委的各项工作都已经做得完美无缺了呢？就没有可批评的吗？当然不是的，事实上，党委的工作中的缺点和错误还是不少的，下边的同志也不是对工作对领导没有一点意见。主要的原因是大家对于开展批评和自我批评特别是自下而上的批评，还是有着各种各样的思想顾虑。有的同志怕得罪了人，以后不好相处；有的人觉得自己对党委的工作不够了解，怕批评错了；有的人怕提了意见，对方不接受甚至受到打击报复等等。这样说，是不是目前在党代表大会上就根本不能充分开展批评和自我批评了呢？当然不是。只要代表大会主席团和前届党委充分发扬民主，批评和自我批评还是能够充分展开的。
    前届党委向代表大会做的报告中，要大胆地揭发和批判自己工作中的缺点和错误，这对于大会开展批评和自我批评有很大的推动作用。前届党委作了自我批评，就可以使大家感到前届党委并不害怕承认缺点和错误，而且有诚意听取大家的批评和意见。前届党委工作报告中如果没有自我批评，而只是会议主席团号召大家提意见，那末，大会上的批评和自我批评是不能开展的。这次黑龙江各市、县、企业党组织的党代表大会的情况就是这样的。这里有两个明显的例子。穆棱县前届县委向党代表大会做工作报告的时候，能够比较深刻地从各方面揭发自己领导工作中的保守思想，分析保守思想的根源，并且提出了克服的办法。比如，在领导今年的农业增产运动的时候，县委就还是用小农经济的眼光来看集体经济，虽然也订出了每垧地比去年增产158斤的计划，但总感到把握不大。实际上这个指标并不高，可以达到。代表们听了县委的报告以后，就很自然地展开了批评和自我批评。朗乡森林工业党委党代表大会的情况就恰恰相反。前届党委向代表大会做的报告中，对企业党委领导工作中的缺点，都只是笼统地抽象地提了几句，也没有提出具体的改进办法。相反地，在这个报告中却过多地批评一般党员和下级组织，而且要大家在大会上进行检讨。这个党委所以这样做，是因为觉得这个代表大会的“批评的重点应该放到下边，而不应该放在党委身上。”这种了解和作法是不对的。不检查上届党委工作中的缺点和错误，也就不能很好地克服纠正一般党员和下级党组织工作中的缺点、错误。同时，下级党组织和一般党员的缺点、错误，不是和党委的领导没有联系的。因此，只批评下边而不检查上边，不仅问题得不到彻底的解决，而且容易引起下级组织和一般党员的不满。朗乡森林工业党代表大会上就有人说，“党委有缺点都不检查，还批评我们呢！”后来，前届党委委员在大会发言中检查了自己的缺点和错误，这才使大会的批评和自我批评逐渐展开。
    把批评的锋芒，引导到主要问题上来，这也是使大会批评和自我批评展开的一个重要办法。穆棱县党代表大会在这方面是做得比较好的。他们以克服保守思想，争取提前完成五年计划为大会的中心。不论是前届党委的工作报告还是代表的发言，都从农业生产、地方工业、党的思想建设和组织建设等各个方面，揭发和批判了保守思想。经过这样的讨论，代表们都觉得思想明确了，大家的认识也统一了，增强了提前完成五年计划的信心。也有一些党代表大会没有注意到这个问题，结果，大家就泛泛地讨论或者只提些琐碎问题，比如，在有的县的党代表大会上，代表们只是提了一些这样的意见：“篮球架子太少，职工们玩不过来，这是县委不关心职工身体健康的表现。”“县城里澡塘只有一个，洗澡要排队、澡塘不卫生，县委为什么不想办法呢？”这样，大家的注意力就分散在一些琐碎的问题上，而不能集中力量讨论主要的问题。有些同志可能会说，在党的会议上，党员既然有权利批评党的任何工作中的缺点和错误，大会主席团去引导代表们围绕着主要的问题开展讨论，岂不是限制了代表的批评吗？不会的，集中力量讨论主要问题，是为了动员大家围绕主要问题进行批评和自我批评，同时也不是不允许大家在其他方面提出意见。应该向代表们讲清楚，党代表大会是党的最高领导机关，应该集中力量讨论解决党的工作中的最重要的问题，一般性的问题，可以提到日常的党的会议上去讨论。事实证明，只要向大家讲清道理，只要不限制大家的发言，就不但可以保证大会集中力量解决主要问题，而且也不会影响大家的积极性。
    当然，仅只在党代表大会上开展批评还是不够的。下一届的党委和各级党组织，必须认真地根据大家的批评和建议来改进工作。否则，如果党代表大会上的批评在实际工作中不发生作用，那么大家对开展批评就会有新的顾虑，不论是党内的经常的民主生活还是以后的党代表大会的发扬民主，就都会受到很大的影响。
