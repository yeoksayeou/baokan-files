Xinhua News Agency, May 1st – The Central Flood Control Headquarters issued instructions on flood prevention work on April 30th.

The instructions first pointed out: For flood prevention of major rivers, flood control requirements should be raised based on the annual strengthening of engineering. This year, the Yellow River is required to ensure that the Qin Plant can withstand floods that occur once in a century without breaching or changing course. Before the Sanmenxia Reservoir can control floods, efforts should be made to prevent serious disasters; the middle and lower reaches of the Huai River are required to defend against floods of the 1954 type without problems, and the upper reaches are required to defend against floods of the 1950 type; the flood control projects of the Yangtze River have been generally strengthened after the 1954 floods, and are required to reduce disasters in the event of 1954-type floods. Other larger rivers shall have flood control requirements stipulated by each province.

The instructions pointed out: There are numerous medium and small rivers across the country, affecting a wide area. Before the flood control capacity of the dikes of these rivers is universally improved, we must pay attention to vigorously preventing floods to reduce disasters. Therefore, all localities must strengthen leadership in flood prevention work for medium and small rivers.

The instructions pointed out: Pre-flood inspection work is an important means to overcome complacency and strengthen flood prevention leadership. All localities should conduct a major inspection of flood prevention preparations before the flood season, to understand the river conditions, flood control projects, and flood prevention organization, so as to have a clear understanding. In the inspection work, any parts of the dikes with poor quality must be dealt with in a timely manner, and internal hidden dangers must be eliminated in conjunction with cone penetration tests of the dike body; operation tests must be carried out on culverts and sluices, and any obstacles found must be repaired immediately; flood prevention materials must be inventoried and properly stored; the replenishment of materials should be carried out by pre-purchasing with post-payment or return if not used, so as to avoid stockpiling. The instructions specifically pointed out: This year, a large number of small reservoirs have been built in various places. Leaders in various places must remember the lessons of past collapses of some small reservoirs and organize the masses and technical cadres as early as possible to conduct universal and key project inspections and repairs.

　　中央防汛总指挥部发布防汛工作指示
    据新华社1日讯　中央防汛总指挥部在四月三十日发布防汛工作指示。
    指示首先指出：对大江大河的防汛，应当根据工程逐年加强的情况，提高防汛要求。黄河今年要求保证秦厂百年一遇的洪水不决口改道，在三门峡水库未拦洪前，应努力防止发生严重灾害；淮河中、下游地区要求防御1954年型洪水不出问题，上游要求防御1950年型洪水；长江防汛工程在1954年洪水以后已经普遍加强，要求在1954年型洪水情况下减轻灾害。其他较大河流，由各省规定防汛要求。
    指示指出：全国中、小河流数目众多，影响的面积很广。在这些河流堤防的防洪能力没有普遍提高之前，必须注意大力防汛以减免灾害。因之，各地必须加强领导中、小河流的防汛工作。
    指示指出：汛前检查工作是克服麻痹思想，加强防汛领导的重要手段，各地要在汛前进行一次防汛准备工作的大检查，对河道情况、防洪工程及防汛组织进行摸底，作到心中有数。在检查工作中对堤防质量不好的部分必须及时处理，并且要结合堤身锥探检查，消灭内部的隐患；对涵闸必须进行操作试验，发现障阻立即修理；对防汛器材要进行清查，妥善保管；添置器材要采取事前预购，用后付款或不用归还的办法，以免积压。指示中特别指出：今年各地修建了大量小型水库，各地领导必须记取过去有些小水库倒坝的教训，尽早组织群众和技术干部进行普遍的和重点工程的检查和整修。
