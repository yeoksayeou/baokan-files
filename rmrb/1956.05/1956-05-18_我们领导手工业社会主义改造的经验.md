    Our Experience in Leading the Socialist Transformation of Handicrafts
    Li Bao Shan, Deputy Secretary of the Hui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Henan Province.

    The socialist transformation of handicrafts in Hui County lagged behind agricultural cooperativization. Initially, the county committee, district committees, and even village branches generally believed that the main task in the countryside was agricultural cooperativization (which was correct), and that once agricultural cooperativization was done well, all problems would be solved. As for handicrafts, it was thought that there were few handicraft workers, so the problem was not significant, and a few specialized cadres could handle the work. However, these specialized cadres also had some ideological problems, fearing that too many handicraft cooperatives would be difficult to manage, especially the supply and marketing, and would become a burden. Therefore, the work was very passive. At that time, in addition to the five or six handicraft cooperatives that had already been organized, a large number of handicraftsmen were absorbed into agricultural production cooperatives. As a result, a chaotic situation arose in the socialist transformation of handicrafts. For example, at that time, the countryside needed a large number of bricks, tiles, and lime for digging wells, but only a few agricultural cooperatives produced them as a sideline, and the output was very small, which could not meet the demand. On the other hand, many handicraftsmen urgently requested to join handicraft cooperatives, and no fewer than dozens of people applied to the county handicraft management section every day.

    This situation attracted the attention of the county committee, and it was seriously analyzed. It was believed that it was difficult to implement technological reforms and play their due role if handicrafts with high commercial value and technical skill were cooperativized together with agriculture; it would also inevitably affect the supply of means of production and means of livelihood to farmers. This was detrimental to the development of both agriculture and handicrafts. Therefore, based on the principle of benefiting both agriculture and handicrafts, the county committee decided that all individual handicraftsmen in market towns should be organized into cooperatives by the handicraft department; farmers engaged in handicrafts as a sideline, with handicrafts income as the main source, should be organized by the handicraft department as a priority, according to the needs of both agriculture and handicrafts and their own willingness.

    Our main methods for leading the socialist transformation of handicrafts are:

    First, strengthen the leadership of the Party and make comprehensive plans. In order to correct the incorrect views of some party members and cadres on the socialist transformation of handicrafts, the county committee successively convened an enlarged meeting of the county committee and a meeting of 440 grassroots party organizations and activists to convey the instructions of the provincial party committee on the socialist transformation of handicrafts. Through study and ideological examination, understanding was enhanced, and tasks were clarified. On this basis, a preliminary comprehensive plan was drawn up based on the distribution of handicrafts in the county, the different characteristics of mountainous, semi-mountainous, and plain areas, and the development of production and the needs of the masses. After the meeting, the party branch secretaries of each township conveyed the spirit of the meeting at township party branch meetings and successively convened handicraft workers' conferences to carry out extensive propaganda. At the same time, in order to strengthen the organizational leadership of handicraft work, a seven-member group for the socialist transformation of handicrafts and private industrial and commercial enterprises was formed by the deputy secretary of the county party committee and others. At the same time, 60 cadres from relevant departments were transferred to form 11 mixed work groups for handicrafts and commerce, and they went deep into areas where handicrafts and commerce were concentrated to carry out socialist transformation work. This prepared the ground for the complete cooperativization of handicrafts.

    Second, strengthen the connection between handicraft cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives, and combine production with the consolidation and rectification of the cooperatives. By January 16, handicrafts throughout the county had basically been organized. However, due to the rapid development of the socialist transformation of handicrafts, some new problems arose after the establishment of the cooperatives. The main problems were that the foundation of the newly established cooperatives was weak, the leading cadres were unfamiliar with the business, the business could not be carried out, production could not be started, and there were even phenomena such as idleness and waste in some cooperatives. In response to these problems, the county committee determined that handicraft cooperatives should also focus on developing production and arrange production according to different industries and seasons. In light of spring production and well-digging tasks, the county committee convened a meeting to arrange the production of iron and wood, brick and tile, and lime cooperatives, and to communicate the relationship between handicraft cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives. In order to strengthen the connection between handicraft cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives so that the products of handicraft cooperatives could directly meet with farmers, the county committee instructed each township to convene joint meetings of cadres of agricultural cooperatives, handicraft cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and credit cooperatives. Before the meeting, the handicraft cooperatives handed over the catalog of products they could supply to the agricultural cooperatives for discussion. At the meeting, the quantity and timing of product supply and demand were listed, and the central township party branch assisted the supply and marketing cooperative, handicraft cooperative, credit cooperative, and agricultural cooperative in research, and then mobilized the cooperatives to sign contracts or agreements with each other. This enabled the various relevant departments to be consistent in their production and sales work, and enabled the handicraft cooperatives to carry out production in a planned manner. According to the contracts and agreements signed, the iron and wood industry cooperative dispatched a total of 57 mobile repair teams, 165 people, to more than 40 agricultural cooperatives to repair farm tools, repairing more than 17,000 pieces of farm tools, which was welcomed by the farmers. At the same time, the handicraft cooperatives also held small-scale product exhibitions, widely solicited farmers' opinions, and greatly helped the handicraft cooperatives improve product specifications and quality.

    After arranging production, the county committee convened a county-wide conference on the consolidation and rectification of handicraft cooperatives. At the meeting, the county committee called for the development of socialist competition.

    Through the competition, the enthusiasm and creativity of the members were brought into play, production efficiency was improved, product quality was guaranteed, and costs were reduced.

    Third, solve various specific problems in a timely manner. After the establishment of the handicraft cooperatives, in addition to the production problems within the cooperatives, several other problems occurred. First, there were few cadres in the handicraft cooperatives, their level was low, and their quality was not high, which could not meet the current work needs. Therefore, the county committee systematically transferred a group of cadres with commensurate abilities to various grassroots societies to serve as directors of grassroots societies, party branch secretaries, business leaders, and accountants, solving the difficulty of insufficient cadres. Second, after the handicraft cooperatives were organized, they generally lacked housing. Therefore, the county committee instructed the party branches of each township to find ways to help the handicraft cooperatives solve the housing problem. Now, more than 400 houses have been found for iron and wood, brick and tile, and lime cooperatives throughout the county. In addition, a construction site of 24,000 square meters was allocated to the iron and wood industry cooperative in Chengguan Town for the construction of factories. Third, after the great development of handicraft cooperativization, the number of members increased, but the bank loan quotas did not increase, and the cooperatives could not obtain sufficient funds from the bank. The county committee and relevant departments studied and, to the extent possible, based on the spirit of turning dead money into live money, first mobilized members to invest 11,000 yuan; then the state provided short-term credit assistance of 20,000 yuan; and used the farmers' water conservancy loans, according to 50% of the value of the signed brick and lime contracts, as advance payments to the brick and lime cooperatives (the bank interest was borne by the handicraft cooperatives); and the poverty alleviation fund loans originally controlled and adjusted by the supply and marketing cooperatives were not directly lent to poor farmers, but were used by the handicraft cooperatives, and the handicraft cooperatives re-lent the means of production to poor farmers. Fourth, the division of labor between handicraft cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives in business. Based on the principle of overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement and the principle of benefiting production and facilitating the needs of the masses, the county committee decided that raw materials such as scrap steel, scrap iron, wood, bamboo, and rice straw required by handicrafts could be directly purchased by the handicraft cooperatives. In terms of product promotion, handicraft cooperatives can set up their own retail departments, and all handicraft cooperatives can engage in self-production and self-sales. This has generally reduced the price of means of production by 7% to 10%.

    After the rectification of the Hui County Handicraft Cooperative, the ideological awareness of the members has been improved, the production management of the society has been improved, and remarkable achievements have been made in all aspects of work. However, there are still some problems at present: for example, the leading cadres are still unfamiliar with the business; the leading cadres of individual cooperatives are not doing enough to rely on the masses to run the society; and the financial work of individual cooperatives is somewhat chaotic. In the future, we must continue to strengthen leadership, make good long-term plans, and further develop socialist competition, and mobilize all members to work together to run the handicraft cooperative well.

    我们领导手工业社会主义改造的经验
    中共河南省辉县县委副书记　栗保善
    辉县手工业社会主义改造较迟于农业合作化。开始，县委、区委一直到乡支部，普遍认为农村的主要任务是农业合作化（这是对的），只要搞好农业合作化，一切问题都解决了。对手工业则认为手工业工人人数少，问题不大，靠几个专业干部做工作就可以了。而这些专业干部在思想上也有一些问题，怕手工业合作社组织得多了不好领导，特别是怕供产销有困难，背上一个包袱。因此，工作非常被动。当时除原组织起来的五、六个手工业合作社外，大批手工业者都被吸收到农业生产合作社里。这样做的结果，造成了手工业社会主义改造工作中的混乱现象。如当时农村需要大量打井的砖瓦和石灰，但是砖瓦、石灰只有个别农业合作社兼营生产，并且产量很少，不能满足需要。另一方面，不少手工业者则迫切要求参加手工业合作社，每天到县手工业管理科申请的不下几十个人。
    这种情况，引起了县委的注意，并认真作了分析，认为商品性大、技艺性高的手工业和农业一起合作化，很难实行技术改革和发挥它们应有的作用；也必然影响到对农民生产资料和生活资料的供应。这对农业、手工业双方的发展都是不利的。因此，县委本着农业和手工业双方有利的原则，决定集镇上的个体手工业者全部由手工业部门组织合作社；兼营手工业的农民，以手工业收入为主，根据农业和手工业双方需要和本人自愿，尽先由手工业部门把他们组织起来。
    我们领导手工业社会主义改造的主要方法是：
    第一、加强党的领导，作好全面规划。为了纠正一部分党员干部对手工业社会主义改造工作的不正确看法，县委先后召开了县委扩大会和四百四十人的基层党组织、积极分子大会，传达了省委的有关手工业社会主义改造工作的指示，通过学习和检查思想，提高了认识，明确了任务。在这个基础上，根据全县手工业分布情况和山区、半山区、平原等不同特点，根据发展生产和群众需要，初步拟定了一个全面规划。会后，各乡党支部书记在乡党支部会议上传达了会议精神，并先后召开了手工业者大会，大张旗鼓地进行了宣传。同时，为了加强手工业工作的组织领导，由县委副书记等人组成了手工业、私营工商业社会主义改造的七人小组。同时，又抽调了有关部门的六十名干部，组成十一个手工业和商业混合工作小组，分别深入到手工业、商业比较集中的地区进行社会主义改造工作。这样就为手工业全部合作化做好了准备工作。
    第二、密切手工业合作社和农业合作社的联系，结合生产进行社的整顿巩固工作。到一月十六日止，全县手工业基本上已组织起来。但由于手工业社会主义改造工作发展得迅速，建社后出现了一些新的问题，主要的是新建社的基础差、领导干部对业务生疏，业务开展不起来，生产不能就绪，甚至有些合作社还有窝工浪费等现象。针对这些问题，县委确定手工业合作社同样要以发展生产为中心，要按照不同行业，不同季节，安排生产。根据春季生产和打井的任务，县委召开了会议，安排了铁木、砖瓦、石灰业合作社的生产，沟通了手工业合作社和农业合作社的关系。为了加强手工业合作社和农业合作社的联系，使手工业合作社产品能直接和农民见面，县委又指示各乡召集农业合作社、手工业合作社、供销社、信用合作社干部联席会议。会前由手工业合作社把所能供应的产品目录交给农业合作社讨论，在会上列出产品供、求数量和时间，经中心乡党支部协助供销社、手工业合作社、信用合作社和农业合作社研究，然后发动社与社签订合同或协议。这样做使各有关部门在产销工作上步调一致起来，使手工业合作社也能有计划地进行生产。铁木业合作社按照所订的合同和协议，截至三月上旬共出动五十七个流动修配组，165人到四十多个农业合作社去修配农具，共修配了大小农具约一万七千多件，受到了农民的欢迎。同时，各手工业合作社还举办了小型产品展览会，广泛地征求了农民的意见，对手工业合作社改进产品规格和质量的帮助很大。
    安排生产之后，县委又召开了全县手工业合作社整顿巩固工作会议。会上县委号召展开社会主义竞赛。
    通过竞赛，发挥了社员的积极性和创造性，提高了生产效率，保证了产品质量，降低了成本。
    第三、及时地解决各种具体问题。手工业合作社建立起来以后，除了社内生产上的问题以外，还发生了其他方面的几个问题。一、手工业合作社干部少、水平低、质量不高，不能适应目前工作需要。因此县委有计划地抽调了一批能力相称的干部到各基层社，分别担任基层社主任、党支部书记、业务负责人员和会计等，解决了干部不足的困难。二、手工业合作社组织起来后，普遍地缺少房子。因此，县委责成各乡党支部设法帮助手工业合作社解决房子问题。现在在全县范围内已经先后为铁木业、砖瓦、石灰业等合作社找到了四百多间房子。此外，又在城关镇拨给了铁木业合作社二万四千平方公尺的建筑工地，以供建厂使用。三、手工业合作化大发展后，社员增加了，可是银行贷款指标没有增加，合作社在银行不能贷到足够的资金。县委和有关部门研究，在可能的范围内，本着以死钱变活钱的精神，先发动社员投资一万一千元；然后由国家扶助短期信贷二万元；又利用农民水利贷款，按已签订的砖、石灰合同价值50％，作为向砖、石灰合作社的预付金（银行利息由手工业合作社负担）；将原供销合作社掌握调剂的贫农基金贷款，不直接贷给贫苦农民，归手工业合作社使用，手工业合作社作出生产资料再贷给贫苦农民。四、手工业合作社和供销合作社在业务上的分工问题。县委根据统筹兼顾、全面安排的方针和有利于生产、便利于群众需要的原则，决定凡手工业所需要的废钢、废铁、木材、竹子、稻草等原料，可以由手工业合作社直接采购。在推销产品方面，手工业合作社可自设门市部，凡手工业合作社能经营的，都可以进行自产自销。这样做，使生产资料的价格普遍降低了7％到10％。
    辉县手工业合作社经过整顿以后，社员的思想觉悟提高了、社的生产管理改善了，各方面工作都取得了显著的成绩。但是目前仍然存在一些问题：如领导干部对业务仍然生疏；个别合作社领导干部依靠群众办社还做的不够；个别合作社财务工作有些混乱。今后必须继续加强领导，作好远景规划，并且进一步开展社会主义竞赛，发动全体社员共同为办好手工业合作社而努力。
