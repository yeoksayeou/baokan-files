　　Developing Pig Farming

　　Liaoning Province Propagates New Jin Pigs

　　In Liaoning Province, the “New Jin Pig” is being bred and promoted on a large scale in rural areas. Currently, forty counties and cities throughout the province are establishing New Jin breeding pig farms. Some agricultural production cooperatives with suitable conditions are also establishing one or two New Jin breeding pig farms, with the help of the breeding farms. This year, 15% of pigs throughout the province will be improved using New Jin pigs.

　　The New Jin Pig is a breed of pig produced in Xinjin County. This pig was bred more than ten years ago by crossbreeding local pigs with "Berkshire" boars. This type of pig is relatively resistant to coarse feed and has strong disease resistance. It can be fattened in ten months, reaching a weight of about 250 pounds. Its reproductive capacity is also strong, averaging nine to ten piglets per litter.

　　Guangdong to Raise 10 Million Pigs This Year

　　This year, agricultural cooperatives in Guangdong Province plan to increase the number of pigs raised from more than 7 million last year to 10 million.

　　To alleviate the current difficulties faced by agricultural cooperatives, the National Bank recently allocated 2 million yuan in loans to agricultural cooperatives for pig raising funds, and the grain department allocated 100 million jin of grain for feed. The Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture held a special meeting and decided that each cooperative should establish a feed base in the short term.

　　Agricultural Cooperative Awarded Pig Raising Red Banner

　　The Renhe Agricultural Cooperative in Yong'an Township, Wenjiang County, Sichuan Province, recently received the Red Banner for Excellence in restoring and developing pig production, awarded by the Township Red Banner Competition Committee. The cooperative currently has 405 pigs, an increase of more than 94% compared to the beginning of this year.

　　Because the cooperative has a large number of pigs, the fertilizer is particularly sufficient. This year, topdressing of spring crops has increased compared to previous years, with rapeseed yields increasing by 23 jin per mu and wheat yields increasing by 49 jin per mu.

    发展养猪业
    辽宁省繁殖新金猪
    辽宁省农村中在大规模地繁殖和推广“新金猪”。目前全省四十个县、市正在建立新金种猪繁殖场。一些有条件的农业生产合作社在繁殖场帮助下，也建立了一处到两处培育新金猪的种猪繁殖场。全省今年将有15％的猪用新金猪改良。
    新金猪是新金县出产的一种猪。这种猪早在十多年前，是由本地猪和“巴克夏”种猪杂交培育出来的。这种猪比较耐粗饲，并且抗病能力很强，十个月就能肥育起来，体重达二百五十斤左右。繁殖力也很强，平均每次生产仔猪九头到十头。
    广东今年将养猪一千万头
    广东省农业合作社今年养猪的数量要从去年的七百多万头增加到一千万头。
    为了照顾农业合作社目前的困难，最近国家银行拨出贷款二百万元给农业合作社用作养猪的资金，粮食部门拨出了一亿斤粮食作饲料。广东省农业厅召开专门会议，决定每个社都要在短期内建立饲料基地。
    获得养猪优胜红旗的农业社
    四川省温江县永安乡仁和农业合作社，最近得到乡里红旗竞赛委员会颁发的恢复和发展生猪生产的优胜红旗。这个社现有生猪四零五头，比今年年初增加了94％以上。
    这个社因为毛猪多，肥料特别充足，今年小春作物的追肥比往年增加，油菜每亩增产二十三斤，小麦每亩增产四十九斤。（据新华社讯）
