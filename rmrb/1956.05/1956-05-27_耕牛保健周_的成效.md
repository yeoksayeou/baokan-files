The cattle raising and management work of the agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Shaoguan City, Guangdong Province, has made significant progress recently, which is due to the effectiveness of the "Ox Health Week" held by various cooperatives.

The "Ox Health Week" in the agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Shaoguan City was held from March 15th to 21st. During "Ox Health Week," all cooperatives in the district conducted a comprehensive inspection and assessment of oxen and cattle sheds. After inspection, the cattle sheds were generally cleaned and tidied up, and the dilapidated cattle sheds were repaired; the thin and weak oxen were given improved nutrition and appropriate rest time to restore their strength, and special personnel were assigned to be responsible for grazing and feeding. In order to avoid casualties caused by excessive burden on the oxen, animal power accounting was generally carried out, and the usage quota of oxen was stipulated. After such inspection and handling, cadres and the masses paid attention to the work of protecting and caring for the oxen, and strictly abide by the quota time for using oxen. Now the phenomenon of oxen death in the whole district has basically stopped. Fifty thin and weak oxen in Jingcun, Beixiang, have recovered their strength and are able to cultivate after careful care. "Ox Health Week" played an important role in ensuring timely spring plowing. The practice of holding "Ox Health Week" in the suburbs of Shaoguan City is very meaningful and worth promoting.

    “耕牛保健周”的成效
    最近一个时期，广东省韶关市郊区农业生产合作社的耕牛饲养和管理工作有显著进步，这是因为各个社举行的“耕牛保健周”发生了效果。
    韶关市郊区农业生产合作社的“耕牛保健周”是在三月十五日至二十一日举行的。在“耕牛保健周”里，全区各个社对耕牛和牛栏进行了全面的检查鉴定。经过检查，普遍将牛栏打扫清理了一次，对已破烂的牛栏进行了修理；对瘦弱的耕牛即改善营养，并且给以适当的休息时间，使它们恢复体力，并且指定专人负责放牧饲养。为了避免耕牛负担过重而造成伤亡事故，普遍进行畜力核算，规定了耕牛的使用定额。经过这样的检查处理后，干部和群众对耕牛护养工作重视起来，都严格地遵守耕牛使用定额时间。现在全区的耕牛死亡现象已基本停止。北乡靖村五十头瘦弱的耕牛，经过细心护养，已经恢复体力，能够耕作。“耕牛保健周”对于保证及时春耕，起了重要的作用。韶关市郊区举行“耕牛保健周”的做法是很有意义的，值得提倡。
