    Successful Oil Extraction from Corn Germ

    The Shanghai Municipal Oils and Fats Company, in cooperation with the Shanghai Chemical Raw Materials Company, successfully experimented with extracting oil from corn germ at the joint state-private De Feng Starch Factory and the joint state-private Ren Chang Oil Pressing Factory.

    Using corn germ to extract oil is already practiced in scientifically advanced countries such as the Soviet Union. Corn germ, after removing protein and starch, still contains a large amount of fat. In this experiment, the highest oil yield reached over 34%. The extracted oil has high nutritional value and can be eaten after refining.

    Currently, the joint state-private Far East and De Feng Starch Factories in Shanghai have begun producing this oil. It is estimated that Shanghai can increase oil production by more than 200,000 jin this year by using corn germ to extract oil, which is enough for 800,000 citizens to consume for one month.

    用玉蜀黍胚芽榨油成功
    上海市油脂公司在上海市化工原料公司的配合下，在公私合营德丰淀粉厂和公私合营仁昌榨油厂试验用玉蜀黍胚芽榨油成功。
    利用玉蜀黍的胚芽榨油，在苏联等科学先进的国家已经实行。在玉蜀黍的胚芽中，除去蛋白质和淀粉，还含有大量脂肪。在这次试验中，出油率最高达34％以上。榨出来的油，营养价值很高，经过精炼后就能食用。
    目前，上海已有公私合营远东、德丰淀粉厂开始生产这种油。据估计，上海市今年利用玉蜀黍的胚芽榨油，可以增产油脂二十多万斤，足供八十万市民食用一个月。
