Xinhua News Agency, May 26th:

    Lei Renmin Replied to Murata Shozo and Ikeda Masanosuke
    Agreed to Extend the Validity of the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement by One Year
    Xinhua News Agency, May 26th – The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade has agreed to the Japanese side's proposal to extend the validity of the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement by one year.
    This was announced by Lei Renmin, Vice-Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, in a reply letter dated May 18th to Murata Shozo, Chairman of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, and Ikeda Masanosuke, Representative Director of the League of Diet Members for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade.
    In his reply, Lei Renmin said: "We agree to your proposal to extend the validity of the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement from May 4, 1956, until the date of signing and entry into force of a new agreement, but the extension period is limited to one year."
    The reply agreed that both parties would handle the agreement extension formalities by exchanging letters, and announced that this letter would serve as the Chinese side's reply agreeing to extend the validity of the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.
    The reply welcomed the Japanese side to send a delegation to Beijing at a time they deem appropriate, or for China to send a delegation to Japan, to exchange views on the various issues raised in the letters from Murata Shozo and Ikeda Masanosuke that were not realized in the Third Agreement, such as expanding this year's Sino-Japanese trade volume, establishing commercial representative offices in each other's countries, and signing a payment agreement.
    Murata Shozo and Ikeda Masanosuke sent a letter to the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade on April 28th. In their letter, they stated that the Third Japan-China Trade Agreement signed on May 4, 1955, played a significant role in promoting and expanding trade between the two countries. According to this agreement, from May 1955 to February 1956, Japan exported 9 million pounds (completing 30%) and imported 23.4 million pounds (completing 78%); the Chinese Commodities Exhibition was successfully exhibited in Tokyo and Osaka, with great results, which is truly gratifying. The letter expressed regret that important issues such as the lifting of embargoes on goods listed in the agreement had not yet been resolved.
    The letter stated that the Japanese side will continue to work hard to implement the agreement in the future, and at the same time looks forward to the early conclusion of a trade agreement between the two governments. However, as the current agreement's validity period is about to expire, in order to avoid a situation of no agreement, it is suggested that the validity of the Third Japan-China Trade Agreement be extended for one year from May 4, 1956. If the Chinese side agrees to this suggestion, the Japanese side will strive to resolve the outstanding issues in the current agreement during the extension period, such as the payment agreement and the establishment of commercial representative offices.
    Murata Shozo and Ikeda Masanosuke also expressed their willingness to work towards the early conclusion of the Fourth Trade Agreement.

    雷任民回信给村田省藏和池田正之辅
    同意第三次中日贸易协定有效期限延长一年
    新华社26日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会已同意日本方面提出的把第三次中日贸易协定有效期限延长一年的建议。
    这是中国国际贸易促进委员会副主席雷任民，在五月十八日给日本国际贸易促进协会会长村田省藏和日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟代表理事池田正之辅的回信中宣布的。
    雷任民在回信中说：“我们同意贵方的建议把第三次中日贸易协定的有效期限，从1956年5月4日起延长到新协定签字生效日为止，但延长期限以一年为限。”
    回信中同意双方以交换函件来办理协定延期手续，并且宣布这封信就作为中国方面同意延长第三次中日贸易协定有效期限的复函。
    回信中欢迎日本方面在他们认为适当的时候派遣代表团来北京或由中国派遣代表团去日本，就村田省藏和池田正之辅来信中所提的扩大今年中日贸易额以及互设商务代表机构、签订支付协定等第三次协定未实现的各项问题交换意见。
    村田省藏和池田正之辅是在四月二十八日给中国国际贸易促进委员会来信的。他们在来信中说，1955年5月4日签订的第三次日中贸易协定，对促进和扩大两国间的贸易起了很大作用。根据这个协定，日本从1955年5月到1956年2月出口九百万英镑（完成30％），进口二千三百四十万英镑（完成78％）；中国商品展览会已经胜利地在东京和大阪展出，收到很大效果，实足欣庆。信中对协定中所列商品的解除禁运等重要问题到现在还没有解决表示遗憾。
    来信表示，日本方面今后还要继续努力来实现协定，同时期待两国政府间签订贸易协定的日期能早日来到。不过目前协定有效期间将届期，为了避免无协定状态的出现，建议把第三次日中贸易协定的有效期限从1956年5月4日起延长一年。如果中国方面同意这一建议，日本方面将在延长期间中努力争取解决目前协定中尚未解决的问题，例如支付协定以及互设商务代表机构等问题。
    村田省藏和池田正之辅还表示，他们愿意为尽早签订第四次贸易协定而努力。
