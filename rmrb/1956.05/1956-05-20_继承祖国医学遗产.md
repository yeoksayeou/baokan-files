Traditional Chinese Medicine for Treating Athlete's Foot

The Shanghai Public Security Hospital has achieved excellent results in treating over 3,000 cases of athlete's foot using a compound Chinese medicine wash made from *Pseudolarix amabilis* bark.

The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau promoted this prescription to over 100 hospitals and other medical institutions throughout the city on the 18th.

The Shanghai Public Security Hospital has been using *Pseudolarix amabilis* bark wash to treat tinea infections since 1951. Over 3,000 people have been treated in the past five years. Patients with athlete's foot apply the medicine once or twice a day. The itching stops after two or three days, and flaking and peeling disappear after about two weeks, with all symptoms completely gone. Apart from some reinfections, no recurrences have been observed in recent years. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

Efficacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Treating Orthopedic Conditions

An elderly man, Ma Chenglong, with a severe fracture deemed untreatable, is now able to walk with a cane after being treated by Guo Hanzhang, a traditional Chinese medicine orthopedic doctor at the Xi'an Municipal Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic.

Guo Hanzhang treats various orthopedic conditions using secret ancestral formulas, mainly including sixteen formulations such as "Tendon-Stretching and Blood-Activating Powder," "Bone-Setting and Tendon-Connecting Powder," "Tendon-Strengthening and Bone-Nourishing Pill," and "Tendon and Bone Pain Medicated Wine," in combination with bone-setting surgery. Since he began working at the Xi'an Municipal Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic in April of last year, he has treated over 400 patients. Among the more than 300 fracture and dislocation patients, 96% have fully recovered. Patients experience less pain and no sequelae.

In 1954, Dr. Guo Hanzhang wrote a book about his bone-setting experience, fully disclosing his family's secret formulas passed down for six generations.
