Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 24th—U.S. President Eisenhower stated again at yesterday’s press conference that the United States opposes Egypt's recognition of the People's Republic of China. He said Egypt's decision to recognize China "is a mistake," but he also said that a single action by one country will not destroy the United States' friendship with it.

    When Eisenhower spoke about the overall world situation, he said that he believed some progress had been made toward lasting peace, although the road was slow and painful.

    When Eisenhower spoke about the Soviet Union's new disarmament decision, he said that if the plan "proves" to actually reduce armed forces, "that would be a very welcome step" and would be "real progress." But he expressed doubt, saying that the United States does "not understand its significance" and "the actual intentions of the Russians." Eisenhower pointed out that the United States' policy is: regardless of what the Soviet Union does, the United States must "adopt its own policies" and "maintain its armed forces at a sufficient level" to meet its own "needs," "and then watch the Russians' every move with hope and caution."

    A reporter asked Eisenhower why there were "so many differences in the various official reactions" of the United States to the Soviet Union's new disarmament decision, and cited Dulles' and Stassen's remarks as examples. Eisenhower said he thought both of their views were "logical."

    "New York Times" reporter Reston, in posing a question, said that the United States has "some well-informed people" who "express genuine concern about the disconnect in our position in a world where the West and the Soviet Union coexist." He asked the President to talk about his views.

    In his response, Eisenhower admitted that "things are far from smooth." He said the United States had desperately tried to put itself in a position to exert influence. But he acknowledged that almost every day foreign parliaments, foreign newspapers, and foreign leaders express disappointment and disapproval of the United States. Eisenhower also said that the Soviet Union's entry into the world economic arena had indeed caused differences of opinion regarding the significance of this matter. But he felt that simply seeing these situations "is not enough," he said, and it is necessary to observe for a period of time to see the broader situation and the situations that are unfolding. He said that "people in the free world" have "too many pessimistic comments" about the international position of the United States, and he expressed his disapproval of this.

    艾森豪威尔表示美国反对埃及承认中国
    他承认美国的事情远不顺利
    新华社24日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔在昨天举行的记者招待会上又一次表示，美国反对埃及承认中华人民共和国。他说，埃及承认中国的决定“是一个错误”，但是他又说，一个国家的一个单独行动并不会破坏美国对它的友谊。
    艾森豪威尔谈到世界整个局势时说，他相信走向持久和平方面已经作出了某些进展，虽然道路是缓慢的和痛苦的。
  艾森豪威尔在谈到苏联裁军新决定的时候说，如果这个计划“证明”的确是裁减了武装部队，“那会是一个受到非常热烈欢迎的步骤”，并且会是“真正的进展”。但是他又表示怀疑说，美国并“不了解它的意义”和“俄国人的实际意图”。艾森豪威尔指出，美国的方针是：不管苏联怎样，美国都必须“采取自己的政策”，把它的武装部队“维持在足够的水平上”以满足它自己的“需要”，“然后抱着希望而又很小心地察看俄国的一举一动”。
    有记者问艾森豪威尔为什么美国对苏联裁军新决定的“各种官方反应中有那么多的分歧”，并且举出杜勒斯和史塔生的言论为例。艾森豪威尔说，他认为他们两个人的看法都是“合乎逻辑的”。
    “纽约时报”记者赖斯顿在提出问题时说，美国有“一些了解情况的人”，“对于我们在西方和苏联互相并立的世界中所处的地位有些脱节这样一种情况表示真正的关切”。他请求美国总统谈谈他的看法。
    艾森豪威尔在回答中承认“事情远不是顺利的”。他说，美国曾经拚命使自己处在能够发挥影响的地位。但是，他承认，几乎每一天都有外国议会、外国报纸和外国领袖对美国表示失望和不赞成。艾森豪威尔还说，苏联的进入世界经济领域确是引起了对这件事情的意义的意见分歧。但是他认为单单看到这一些情况“是不够的”，他说，必须观察一个时期，看看广泛的情况和正在发生的局势。他说，“自由世界的人们”对美国的国际处境“悲观的言论太多”，他对这一点表示不以为然。
