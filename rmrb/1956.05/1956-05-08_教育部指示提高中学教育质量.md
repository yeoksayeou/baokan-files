　　Ministry of Education Issues Instructions to Improve the Quality of Secondary Education

　　The Ministry of Education issued a letter of instruction on the 4th regarding several issues concerning the current improvement of the quality of secondary education.

　　The letter stated that schools may formulate their own work plans in accordance with the overall planning of school education undertakings formulated by the educational administrative leadership organs, combined with specific circumstances. This work plan should include specific provisions for improving the political and professional level of school leaders and teachers; a comprehensive plan should also be made for the establishment of teaching factories, experimental gardens, and the supplementation of teaching equipment. In addition, clear requirements and measures should be put forward in the plan for teaching work, class teacher work, parent work, and health and hygiene work.

　　The letter also mentioned that appropriately increasing the number of teaching hours for teachers is one of the methods to solve the shortage of teachers in the development of education. Under the current conditions, the number of teaching hours for general teachers should be 16 to 18 lessons, and teachers with the right conditions can increase it to about 20 lessons. Increasing the number of teaching hours for teachers requires vigorously overcoming the phenomenon of busyness and disorder in schools, and effectively ensuring teachers' work and study time.

　　The Ministry of Education's letter of instruction requires local educational administrative departments and schools to correct the phenomenon of mechanically transplanting the working methods of production departments into schools. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　教育部指示提高中学教育质量
    教育部在四日发出关于当前提高中学教育质量中几个问题的指示信。
    指示信中说，各校可以按照教育行政领导机关制定的学校教育事业全面规划，结合具体情况制定自己的工作规划。在这个工作规划中，应当就提高学校领导干部和教师的政治、业务水平作出具体规定；对教学工厂、实验园地的建立和教学设备的补充也要做出全面的规划。此外，对教学工作、班主任工作、家长工作和健康卫生工作等，在规划中应当提出明确的要求和措施。
    指示信中还谈到，适当增加教师担任授课时数是解决发展教育事业中师资不足的方法之一。以目前条件看，一般教师担任授课的时数以十六到十八节为宜，有条件的教师还可以增到二十节左右。增加教师授课时数，必须大力克服学校中的忙乱现象，对教师的工作和学习时间予以切实保证。
    教育部的指示信要求各地教育行政部门和学校纠正把生产部门的工作方法机械地搬到学校中来运用的现象。  （据新华社讯）
