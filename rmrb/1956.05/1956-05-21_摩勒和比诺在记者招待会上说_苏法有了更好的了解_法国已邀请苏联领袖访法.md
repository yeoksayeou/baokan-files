Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th - According to TASS, French Prime Minister Mollet and Foreign Minister Pineau held a press conference in Moscow on May 19th. They delivered brief speeches to Soviet and foreign journalists present, summarizing the successful talks that had just concluded between the Soviet and French government delegations.

	Mollet first mentioned that France is a member of certain groups and has certain obligations. It is faithful to these obligations and will continue to be faithful to them in the future. He then added that, incidentally, no one intends to ask us to abandon these obligations.

	Mollet continued, "However, being faithful to our groups does not prevent us from making every effort to promote further relaxation of international tensions and to eliminate mutual distrust. We came to Moscow with this intention. From the very beginning, we stated this to our counterparts in the talks, and we feel that they understand our intentions."

	"If anyone expected more from our talks this time, it is because they are not well informed. In fact, what we expected was to achieve a better understanding of each other through this meeting. If our purpose is understood in this way, then this purpose has been achieved. On some issues, our views have converged. For those issues on which we still have differences of opinion, we have also clarified them through frank discussions."

	Mollet emphasized that the direct results of the talks have been reflected in the joint statement of the Soviet and French government delegations. He said, however, that the more profound results are reflected in our thoughts and feelings, in our reason and consciousness. Mollet said that this statement is fully consistent with France's faithful attitude towards its earlier obligations.

	In response to a question from a reporter, Pineau said that French leaders have invited Soviet leaders to visit France. The issue of the visit will continue to be discussed through diplomatic channels in the future.

	A reporter asked how the French government leaders assessed the atmosphere of the talks. Mollet said that the answer to this question is entirely consistent with his hopes, and he gave a high assessment of the atmosphere of the talks. He emphasized that the exchange of views has convinced both sides that the international situation should be improved and that suspicion and distrust between countries should be eliminated.

    摩勒和比诺在记者招待会上说
    苏法有了更好的了解
    法国已邀请苏联领袖访法
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：法国总理摩勒和外交部长比诺五月十九日在莫斯科举行记者招待会。他们向到会的苏联和外国记者发表了简短的讲话，总结了已经顺利结束的苏联和法国政府代表团之间的会谈。
    摩勒首先提到，法国是某些团体的成员，承担了一定的义务，它忠实于这些义务，而且今后还要对它们保持忠实。他接着又说，顺便提一下，谁也没有打算要求我们放弃这些义务。
    摩勒继续说，但是，忠实于我们的团体，丝毫不妨碍我们竭尽一切的努力，来促成国际紧张局势的进一步和缓，促成消除彼此之间的不信任。我们就是抱着这个打算来到了莫斯科。我们从一开始的时候起就向我们会谈的对方声明过这一点，而且，我们觉得，他们是了解我们的意图的。
    如果有人曾经期待我们这一次的会谈，能有什么更多的结果，那末，这就是因为，他们消息不怎么灵通。实际上，我们所期望的是，通过这次会晤，能够达到相互之间更好的了解。如果这样来理解我们的目的，那末，这个目的是达到了的。在某些问题上，我们的观点接近了。对于那些在我们之间还有分歧看法的问题，通过坦率的讨论，我们也已经更加明确了。
    摩勒强调指出，会谈的直接结果，在苏联和法国双方政府代表团的联合声明中已经反映出来了。他说，但是，意义更加深刻的结果，却是在我们的思想感情当中，在我们的理智和意识当中得到了反映。摩勒说，这个声明，同法国对它早先承担的义务所采取的忠实态度是完全一致的。
    在回答记者提出的问题的时候，比诺说，法国领导人已经邀请苏联领袖访问法国。有关访问的问题，将来还要通过外交途径继续进行讨论。
    有记者问，法国政府领袖对于这次会谈的气氛是怎样估计的。摩勒说，这个问题的答案和他的希望是完全一致的，他对会谈的气氛作了很高的估计。他强调说，交换意见的结果使双方都深信，国际情况应当改善，各国之间的怀疑和不信任应当消除。
