    The First Geophysical Instrument Manufacturing Plant Established
    China's first factory specializing in the manufacture of geophysical instruments for petroleum exploration was officially named and established in Xi'an on the 26th.

    The factory director, Han Qixin, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that the factory's predecessor was a geophysical instrument repair and manufacturing institute under the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, which mainly carried out trial production and research work. Small-scale production only began last year. After being expanded into a factory this year, its main task is to mass-produce petroleum geophysical exploration instruments and carry out trial production and research of new products. He said that the important instruments the factory plans to produce this year include the fully automatic downhole electrical logging instrument, known as the "eyes of petroleum geologists," seismographs that use artificial seismic methods to find underground oil-bearing structures, and more than 20 other types of instruments such as quartz thread gravimeters and borehole calipers. This year, they also plan to trial-produce automatic surface electrical logging instruments and natural gas logging instruments.

    Han Qixin said that in order to meet the needs of petroleum geological exploration work, the factory will also undergo large-scale expansion in the future, striving to take on all the production tasks of various geophysical exploration instruments required by the national petroleum system within two or three years, and develop into a new type of modern instrument manufacturing plant.

    第一座地球物理仪器制造厂成立
    中国第一座专门制造勘探石油用的地球物理仪器的工厂二十六日在西安命名成立。
    这个工厂的厂长韩其信对新华社记者说，这个工厂的前身是石油工业部的一个地球物理仪器修造所，主要是作试制研究工作的，去年才开始了小量生产。今年扩建为工厂以后，它的主要任务是大量生产石油地球物理勘探仪器，同时进行新产品的试制研究工作。他说，这个工厂今年计划生产的重要仪器，包括有人们称为“石油地质工作者的眼睛”的全自动井下电测仪，用人工地震方法寻找地下储油构造的地震仪，以及石英丝重力仪、井径仪等二十多种。今年他们还准备试制自动地面电测仪、天然气测井仪等。
    韩其信说，为了适应石油地质勘探工作的需要，今后这个工厂还要进行大规模的扩建，争取在两三年内，把全国石油系统所需的各种地球物理勘探仪器的生产任务全部担负起来，发展成为一个新型的现代化的仪器制造厂。　（新华社）
