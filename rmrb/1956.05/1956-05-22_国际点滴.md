    Professors Are Worth Little
    Washington University in the United States recently hired a football coach for an annual salary of $17,000. This is obviously because football games are a very profitable thing in the United States. This matter has caused intense dissatisfaction among the faculty and students of the entire school. According to the "Daily," a student-run newspaper at Washington University, this amount of salary could hire three and a half "PhDs" with much more teaching experience than this football coach. One professor lamented that it was "foolish" for them to spend many years receiving specialized education.
    Boring News
    Sixteen hundred Western journalists reported on the wedding of American movie star Grace Kelly and the Prince of Monaco.
    The American magazine "Time" gave a comprehensive report of the contradictory accounts of these journalists. For example: During the wedding ceremony... United Press said Kelly had "tears in her eyes," the Associated Press said "no tears." The Associated Press said Kelly "shyly" looked at the prince "once," the "New York Herald Tribune" said she looked at him "proudly" "once," the "New York Times" said she looked at him "nervously" "twice," while the International News Service said she looked at him "frequently." As for the duration of the wedding, journalist Considine said it was only twenty minutes, Kilgallen said sixteen minutes, the "Washington Post" said forty minutes, and the "New York Times" said fifteen minutes.
    Originally, these reports were boring enough, but adding a synthesis makes it even more meaningless. This can only be a double boredom.
    Such "Good Partners"
    The Japanese Kyodo News Agency recently reported that the relevant US authorities have reached a consensus on the issue of compensation for losses caused by hydrogen bomb tests and have requested Japan to "promptly" submit basic data for calculating losses. Regarding this news, the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated that it would like to submit the data as soon as possible, but believes that some data cannot be known until after the test. The Japan Katsuo and Tuna Fisheries Cooperative Association Federation asked: How should indirect losses suffered due to the tests be calculated? Moreover, this fishery group believes that the US attitude of trying to settle the matter with a little "consolation money" is hateful. It believes that the only way to solve the problem is for the United States to completely stop hydrogen bomb tests.
    But in reality, the United States is not even willing to give "consolation money," let alone stop the tests. US officials immediately said that Kyodo News Agency's report was "baseless" and that the US government still does not recognize that it has any obligation to compensate Japan for its losses. In other words, the United States only has the "right" to cause damage to the people of Asia, but no "obligation" to compensate for such damage. The people of Asia should leave their fate to the United States to control.
    This is the "good partner" relationship that the United States keeps talking about establishing with the people of Asia. Some people in Japan should wake up. (Attached picture)

    教授不值钱
    美国华盛顿大学最近聘请了一位足球教练，年薪一万七千美元。这显然是因为足球比赛在美国是很能赚钱的玩意儿。这件事引起了全校师生的激烈不满。据华盛顿大学学生办的“日报”说，用这个数目的薪金，可以聘请比这个足球教练高明得多的富有教学经验的三个半“博士”。一位教授感叹说，我们用了许多年的时间去受专门教育，真是“傻瓜”。
    无聊的新闻
    一千六百名西方记者报道了美国电影明星凯莉和摩纳哥王子的婚礼。
    美国“时代”周刊给这些记者报道中互相矛盾的地方作了个综合报道。例如：在婚礼进行中……合众社说凯莉“双眼含泪”，美联社说“没有眼泪”。美联社说凯莉“含羞地”看了王子“一次”，“纽约先驱论坛报”说她“骄傲地”看了“一次”，“纽约时报”说她“心神不定地”看了“两次”，而国际新闻社则说她“频频地看”。至于婚礼进行的时间，记者康西丁说只有二十分钟，基尔卡兰说十六分钟，“华盛顿邮报”说四十分钟，“纽约时报”则说十五分钟。
    本来，这些报道已经是够无聊的了，加以综合，更不知道有何意义。这只能是双重的无聊。
    这样的“好伙伴”
    日本共同社最近报道说，美国有关当局对氢弹试验造成的损失实行赔偿的问题取得了一致意见，并且要求日本“迅速”提出作为计算损失的基础资料。对于这个消息，日本外务省表示想尽早提出资料，但是认为有些资料不到试验以后就无法知道。日本鲣鲔业协同组合联合会问道：由于进行试验而蒙受的间接损失到底怎样计算呢？而且，这个渔业团体认为，美国想拿出一点“慰问费”了事的态度是可憎恨的。它认为，解决问题的办法只能是要美国完全停止氢弹试验。
    但是实际上，美国连“慰问费”都不愿意给，更不要说停止试验了。美国官员们立刻说共同社的报道是“没有根据的”，而且说，美国政府仍不承认它有任何义务赔偿日本的损失。换句话说，美国只有给亚洲人民制造损害的“权利”，却没有赔偿这种损害的“义务”。亚洲人民应该把自己的命运听凭美国去摆布。
    这就是美国口口声声要同亚洲人民建立的“好伙伴”关系。日本的某些人应该醒一醒了。（附图片）
