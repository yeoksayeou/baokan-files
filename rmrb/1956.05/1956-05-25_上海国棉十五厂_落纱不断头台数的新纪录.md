    Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 15
    New Record for Number of Spindles Without Yarn Breakage
    Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 15 has recently received many roving workers from fraternal factories who have come to visit and learn from the operating experience of the roving workers in the spinning workshop. In order to reduce yarn breakage during roving, the workers in the roving workshop of this factory usually pay close attention to the maintenance of machinery to overcome factors that cause breakage due to mechanical problems. After the roving workers finish roving, they carefully check the yarn ends, yarn tails, yarn strip positions, and the height of the bobbins. Under the slogan of mutual learning and mutual improvement, the workers also launched an advanced producer movement. In the first half of May, the entire workshop created a new record of averaging 124 spindles per person per day without yarn breakage, and they also realized their initiative of 120 spindles without yarn breakage in the same job competition.

    上海国棉十五厂
    落纱不断头台数的新纪录
    上海国营第十五棉纺织厂最近接待了许多兄弟厂的落纱工人，他们是来参观学习细纱车间落纱工人的操作经验的。这个工厂落纱车间工人们为了减少落纱断头，平时很注意机械的检修工作，克服由于机械上有毛病而造成断头的因素。落纱工人落好纱后，还仔细检查一遍纱头、纱尾、纱条位置和简管高低的情况。工人们还在互相学习、互相提高的口号下，展开了先进生产者运动。在五月上半月，全车间创造了平均每人每天落纱124台不断头的新纪录，并且实现了他们在开展同工种竞赛中提出的落纱一百二十台不断头的倡议。　（孙仲勤）
