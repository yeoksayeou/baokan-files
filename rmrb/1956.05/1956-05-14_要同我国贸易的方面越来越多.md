Thai Cabinet Studies Trade with China
    Xinhua News Agency, May 12th, Bangkok News: Thai Prime Minister Pibul Songkram said on May 11th that the Thai cabinet recently discussed the issue of trade with China. He said that the cabinet agreed to request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to study how to trade with China and what to trade.
    Pibul also said that any trade between Thailand and China will not exceed the scope of the United Nations "embargo."
    According to Agence France-Presse, Thai Foreign Minister Narathip said to Agence France-Presse reporters on May 11th that the Thai cabinet will also study the issue of trade with China at a meeting on May 16th.
    On the same day, Thai Finance Minister and Acting Minister of Economic Affairs Phra Prakas Sahakorn Yuthakit said when talking about trade with China that Thai merchants are already trading with China, although indirectly. He pointed out that Chinese goods are cheaper and better, and they help reduce the cost of living in Thailand. He said: "Thailand's policy is to buy goods of the same quality from the cheapest place."
Japanese Business Community
    Advocates Exporting Steel to China
    Xinhua News Agency, May 11th, Tokyo News: In order to promote the relaxation of restrictions on steel embargoes, the Japanese business community recently established the "Steel Export to China Roundtable."
    Eleven trading companies including "Nichishō," "Itochu Shoji," and "Daiichi Tsusho" participate in this roundtable, including companies affiliated with large trading companies such as "Mitsui" and "Mitsubishi."
    Japan's three major steel companies, "Yawata," "Fuji," and "Kawasaki," will assist the roundtable as observers.
    Xinhua News Agency, May 10th, Tokyo News: Saburo Nango, Chairman of the Japan Foreign Trade Association, believes that with China's economic construction having achieved great achievements, Japan should export various construction materials and production equipment needed for China's economic construction to help China's economic construction. At the same time, Japan should import as much as possible from China the materials needed for industrial and people's lives in Japan. This is the key to developing trade and economic exchanges between Japan and China.
    Nango Saburo will leave Tokyo by plane on the evening of the 10th to visit China. He made the above written statement at a press conference before his departure. He said that the main purpose of this visit to China is to promote friendship and goodwill between Japan and China and to expand trade between the two countries.
West German Business and Industry
    Hope to Trade with China
    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 13th: Bonn News: West German Social Democratic Party Federal Assembly Member Kabitzell said: The Social Democratic Party believes that trade negotiations should be started with the Soviet Union and China as soon as possible.
    Kabitzell made this statement at a press conference on the 11th in refuting a recent speech by West German Foreign Minister Brentano. Brentano said: The restoration of German reunification is a prerequisite for establishing normal trade treaty relations with the Soviet Union, China, and Eastern European countries.
    The Dortmund "West German Daily" on May 8th also criticized Brentano's attitude, expressing the need to normalize trade between West Germany and Eastern countries. The Hamburg "Weekly Report" pointed out that West German industry increasingly needs to establish trade links with Eastern countries, but the government is hindering the establishment of such links with various difficulties.
    According to a report by Coblentz, a Bonn reporter for the "New York Herald Tribune," the American embargo policy against China is "extremely unpopular" in West Germany. He pointed out that important industrial and trade groups in West Germany are publicly expressing their hope for easing export restrictions in order to expand trade with Beijing.
Singapore Businessmen
    Demand Restoration of Trade with China
    Xinhua News Agency, May 11th, Singapore News: Many Singaporean businessmen made statements on May 10th expressing their support for Singapore Chief Minister Marshall's demand to restore trade relations with China. Marshall expressed this hope at a banquet in London on May 8th.
    M.F. Cutler, chairman of the Singapore Chamber of Commerce, said that Singapore is a free trade center with a very important distribution relationship, and it must welcome the relaxation of trade restrictions imposed on all neighboring countries.
    Tan Siew Sin, chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, called for the lifting of the rubber embargo on China for the benefit of Singapore's economy. He said that the embargo is meaningless because China can get supplies from other countries.
    The chairman of the Singapore Indian Congress, commenting on the embargo on rubber exports to China, said: "This is an unrealistic attitude taken by the British and Americans, and their views on this issue should be changed."
    "Burma New Times" says
    The cry to condemn the embargo is rising
    Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, May 13th: "Burma New Times" published an editorial on May 12th saying that the cry to condemn the embargo is rising because the economies of more and more countries that follow this policy are suffering as a result.
    The newspaper pointed out that since 1950, China's foreign trade has been steadily increasing, and equally important is a meaningful change in its trade situation, that is, imports no longer exceed exports. China traded with about 50 countries in 1953, and last year it traded with more than 60 countries.
    The newspaper said that on the other hand, Britain's trade deficit with the dollar area in the three months of June, July, and August last year increased by nearly 60% compared with the same period in 1954. Due to the embargo, other regions of the sterling area are suffering economic losses.

    泰内阁研究同中国进行贸易
    新华社12日讯　曼谷消息：泰国总理銮披汶五月十一日说，泰国内阁最近讨论了同中国贸易的问题。他说，内阁同意要求外交部研究怎样同中国进行贸易和进行什么贸易的问题。
    銮披汶还说，泰国同中国进行的任何贸易都将不超出联合国“禁运”的范围。
    据法新社报道，泰国外交部长那拉底五月十一日对法新社记者说，泰国内阁还将在五月十六日的一次会议上研究同中国进行贸易的问题。
    同一天，泰国财政部长兼经济部代理部长拍母里攀·裕他吉就同中国贸易问题发表谈话的时候说，泰国的商人现在已经在同中国进行贸易，虽然是间接的。他指出，中国的货物比较便宜，也比较好；它们帮助降低了泰国的生活费用。他说：“泰国的政策是要从最便宜的地方购买同样质量的货物”。
    日本企业界
    主张向中国输出钢材
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本企业界为了促进放宽对钢材的禁运限制，最近成立了“向中国输出钢材恳谈会”。
    参加这个恳谈会的有“日商”、“伊藤忠商事”、“第一通商”等十一家贸易公司，其中包括“三井”、“三菱”等大贸易公司所属的公司。
    “八幡”、“富士”、“川崎”日本三大钢铁公司将以观察员的身份给恳谈会以协助。
    新华社10日讯　东京消息：日本输出入协会理事长南乡三郎认为，在中国的经济建设已经得到巨大成就的情况之下，日本应该向中国输出中国在经济建设上所需要的各种建设器材和生产设备，来帮助中国的经济建设。同时也应该尽可能地从中国输入更多的日本在工业方面和人民生活上所需要的物资。这才是发展日中两国贸易和经济交流的重要关键。
    南乡三郎将在十日晚上乘飞机离开东京到中国访问。他是在起程前在记者招待会上发表上述书面谈话的。他说，这次访问中国的主要目的在于促进日中两国的友好亲善和扩大日中两国间的贸易。
    西德工商界
    希望同中国贸易
    新华社柏林13日电　波恩消息：西德社会民主党联邦议院议员卡比泽尔说：社会民主党认为应该尽快同苏联和中国开始贸易谈判。
    卡比泽尔是在驳斥西德外交部长勃伦塔诺最近的一次谈话而在十一日的记者招待会上说这话的。勃伦塔诺说：恢复德国统一是同苏联、中国和东欧国家建立正常贸易条约关系的先决条件。
    五月八日的多特蒙德“西德日报”也批评勃伦塔诺的态度，表示要求使西德和东方国家之间贸易正常化。汉堡的“星期日报”指出，西德工业日益需要同东方国家建立贸易联系，而政府却以种种困难阻碍建立这种联系。
    另据“纽约先驱论坛报”驻波恩记者柯布伦兹报道，美国对中国的禁运政策在西德“极其不得人心”。他指出：西德的重要的工业和贸易团体一个接着一个地公开表示希望放宽出口限制，以便扩大同北京的贸易。
    新加坡商界人士
    要求恢复同中国的贸易
    新华社11日讯　新加坡消息：新加坡许多商界人士在五月十日发表谈话，表示支持新加坡首席部长马歇尔希望恢复同中国的贸易关系的要求。马歇尔是五月八日在伦敦一个宴会上表示这种希望的。
    新加坡商会主席麦·弗·卡特勒说，新加坡是一个自由贸易中心，它具有非常重要的集散关系，必须欢迎对一切邻国所实行的贸易限制的放松。
    中华总商会主席陈锡九要求为了新加坡经济的利益而取消对中国实行的橡胶禁运。他说，禁运没有任何意义，因为中国可以从其他国家得到供应。
    新加坡印度人大会主席在评论对向中国出口橡胶所实行的禁运的时候说：“这是英美人所采取的不现实的态度，他们在这个问题上的看法应该改变过来”。
    “缅甸新时代报”说
    责难禁运的呼声日益高涨
    据新华社仰光13日电　“缅甸新时代报”五月十二日发表社论说，责难禁运的呼声日益高涨，因为愈来愈多的奉行这个政策的国家的经济因此而受到损害。
    报纸指出，自从1950年以来，中国的对外贸易一直稳步上升，同样重要的是它的贸易情况发生一种有意义的变化，就是进口不再超过出口。中国在1953年同约五十个国家贸易，而在去年，它同六十多个国家贸易。
    报纸说，另一方面，英国在去年六、七、八三个月同美元区的贸易赤字比1954年同期增加了将近60％。由于禁运，英镑区的其他地区正在遭受经济损失。
