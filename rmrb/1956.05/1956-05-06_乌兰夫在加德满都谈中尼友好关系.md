Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, May 5th: The Kathmandu City Council Reception Committee held a civic reception on May 4th to welcome delegations from various governments who came to attend the coronation ceremony of the King of Nepal.

　　Ulanhu, Special Envoy of the People's Republic of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, spoke at the meeting. He said that China and Nepal are close neighbors, and for centuries, there has been a sincere friendship and close economic and cultural ties between the peoples of the two countries. In recent years, with the joint efforts of the governments and peoples of the two countries, this friendly relationship with a long historical tradition has gained new development on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and has increasingly rich content. The Chinese people have always watched with sympathy and joy the achievements of our neighbor, the Kingdom of Nepal, in seeking its own economic development and prosperity, and in safeguarding peace.

　　Ulanhu said that since arriving in your country, we have been deeply attracted by the magnificent mountains and rivers and the beauty of your culture, and we have also been deeply moved by the diligence, bravery, and enthusiasm of your people in building the country. Nepal actively participated in the historic Bandung Conference and was admitted to the United Nations; the Nepalese government's support for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and its efforts to ease international tensions and promote friendly cooperation among the peoples of Asian countries have been widely welcomed by the people of the world. It is believable that your country will play an increasingly significant role in international affairs.

　　Ulanhu said that the Chinese government and people are eager to further strengthen the friendly relations between China and Nepal, and to develop mutually beneficial cooperation in the economic field and cultural ties between the two countries. This sincere relationship between our two countries is not only in the interests of both our countries, but will also help peace in Asia and the world. I am deeply convinced that Nepal will achieve new successes in seeking its own development and prosperity, strengthening friendly cooperation with all countries, and safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.

　　Before Ulanhu's speech, Nepalese Prime Minister Prasad Acharya welcomed the distinguished guests on behalf of the government and people of Nepal. Indian Vice President Radhakrishnan and the Chairman of the Kathmandu City Council also spoke at the meeting.
