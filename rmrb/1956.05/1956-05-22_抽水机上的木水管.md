Wooden Water Pipes on Water Pumps

Responsible persons and engineering technicians from the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Industry, Department of Agriculture, Department of Water Conservancy and other relevant units recently held a meeting and decided to universally promote the experience of using wood instead of steel plates to manufacture water inlet and outlet pipes for water pumps.

This type of wooden water pipe was successfully trial-produced by the Jiangxi Machinery Factory in a production competition. Using this wooden water pipe can save 274 kilograms of steel plate in the manufacture of a set of water pumps. Jiangxi Province's machinery factories plan to manufacture one thousand water pumps this year, which can save the country a total of 274 tons of steel plate. Because wooden water pipes are simple to manufacture and the raw materials are cheap, the cost of each water pump can be reduced by 37.5%. The water pumping and irrigation efficiency of wooden water pipes is the same as that of iron water pipes. (Our correspondent in Nanchang)

    抽水机上的木水管
    江西省工业厅、农业厅、水利厅等各有关单位的负责人员和工程技术人员最近开会，决定普遍推广木材代钢板制造抽水机进出水管的经验。
    这种木水管是江西机械厂在生产竞赛中试制成功的。使用这种木水管，制造一套抽水机可以节省钢板274公斤。江西省各机械厂今年计划制造一千部抽水机，总计可以为国家节省钢板274吨。由于木水管制造简单、原料便宜，每部抽水机可以降低成本37.5％。木水管的排灌水效用，同铁水管相同。　（本报驻南昌记者）
