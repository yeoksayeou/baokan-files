　　To the Editor:

　　Li Mingguan and I were transferred from the Organization Department of the Trade Union of the X’ian Mining District in Liaoyuan City to the Beidaihe China Coal Miners Sanatorium in July 1954. At the time of the transfer, the head of the Organization Department of the X’ian Mining District Trade Union said, "Your archive materials will be sent later." However, it has been more than a year since we were transferred, and the original department has not yet sent the archive materials. The Personnel Department of the Sanatorium has repeatedly asked us about it and has also sent letters to the Organization Department of the X’ian Mining District Trade Union to urge them to handle it, but we haven't even received a reply. Last August, when I went home, I personally went to the Organization Department of the X’ian Mining District Trade Union to inquire about this matter. A comrade from the Organization Department said, "We have received your letters, but we haven't been able to find your files, so we are embarrassed to reply to you. This time I will write you a letter, take it back and give it to the personnel officer of the sanatorium." However, when I gave the certificate written by the Organization Department of the X’ian Mining District Trade Union to the personnel officer of the sanatorium, he was surprised and said, "This letter isn't written for you, is it? Why is Zhang Lizhou written as Wang Lizhou?" This left me dumbfounded: I worked in the Organization Department of the X’ian Mining District Trade Union for more than two years, and the person in charge actually got my surname wrong. Because of the above reasons, our personnel relations have not been resolved until now.

　　We want to question the Organization Department of the X’ian Mining District Trade Union, why are you so irresponsible towards transferred personnel? Zhang Lizhou

### 我们的档案材料到哪里去了

    我们的档案材料到哪里去了
　　编辑同志：
    我和李明冠两人在1954年7月由辽源市西安矿区工会组织部调到北戴河中国煤矿工人疗养院工作。在调动工作的时候，西安矿区工会组织部长说：“你们的档案材料以后再寄去。”但是，我们调动工作已经一年多了，原机关还没有把档案材料寄来。疗养院人事部门一再问我们，同时又给西安矿区工会组织部去信催办，但是连个回信都没见。去年八月，我回家的时候，亲自到西安矿区工会组织部去催问这件事。组织部的同志说：“你们的来信都收到了，只是因为没有找到你们的档案，所以也不好意思给你们回信。这回我写封信给你，拿回去交给疗养院人事部门就行了。”但是，当我把西安矿区工会组织部写的证明信交给疗养院人事干事的时候，他吃惊地说：“这信不是替你写的吧？为什么把张立洲给写成王立洲呢？”这把我问得直发楞：我在西安矿区工会组织部工作二年多，而负责人居然会把我的姓都给弄错了。因为以上所说的原因，我们两人的人事关系到现在还不能解决。
    我们要质问西安矿区工会组织部，你们对外调的工作人员为什么这样不负责任呢？  张立洲
