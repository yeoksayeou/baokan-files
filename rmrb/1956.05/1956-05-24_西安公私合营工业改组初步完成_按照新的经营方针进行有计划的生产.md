Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, May 23rd: The economic reorganization of forty-four joint public-private industrial sectors in Xi'an has been preliminarily completed. Now, all joint public-private factories in the city are carrying out planned production in accordance with newly established production policies.

Prior to the reorganization, relevant departments conducted detailed surveys of the production equipment, technical capabilities, supply and sales, and production cooperation relationships of these industries, and formulated production reorganization plans by sector.

Most of the joint public-private factories in the city have made full use of existing equipment and factory buildings during the reorganization. Of the more than two hundred mechanical industrial entities, the majority serve basic construction. Furthermore, the concentration of equipment allows for mutual supplementation of deficiencies between factories, and also improves equipment utilization rates, leading to a merger into seven larger, all-capable factories. In addition, a small number of ironworks repairing waterwheels for farmers in suburban areas, and factories repairing horse-drawn carts, continue to implement independent production, directly serving the masses. Brick and tile factories scattered in the near suburbs, because they all need to obtain raw materials locally and facilitate supply to nearby construction units, are reorganized according to the principle of decentralized production and unified management by district. The thirty-nine sewing and embroidery factories and shops adopted the method of decentralized production in situ and unified management, retaining all original storefronts, making it as convenient as before for residents to customize clothing.

After the reorganization, all joint public-private factories have clear production and management policies, and can all carry out production in accordance with national construction and people's needs. Various production management systems have also been preliminarily established and improved in the factories, and most of the non-production personnel have been transferred to production, reducing non-production expenses. The machine-made metal products factory under the Xi'an Municipal Mechanical Industry Company has unified, balanced, and allocated machinery and equipment, and is now able to manufacture complete products. The sporting goods manufacturing industry is also now able to produce complete sets of sporting goods after the reorganization. After the reorganization of the soda and popsicle manufacturing industry, in addition to increasing the variety of products, the cost of soda has been reduced by 9.3% compared with last year, and the output has increased by about three times. After the reorganization of the building metal materials factory, the workers are able to better exchange experiences, and have now completed the processing task of more than 10,000 screws half a month ahead of schedule.

    西安公私合营工业改组初步完成
    按照新的经营方针进行有计划的生产
    新华社西安23日电　西安市四十四个公私合营工业行业已经初步完成经济改组。现在，全市各公私合营工厂都已按照新订出的生产方针，进行有计划的生产。
    在进行改组以前，各有关部门曾经详细地调查了这些行业的生产设备、技术力量、供销和生产协作关系，按行业作出了生产改组规划。
    全市大部分公私合营工厂在改组中都充分地利用了原有设备和厂房。机械工业两百多户中，大部分为基本建设服务。而且集中起来各厂设备可互补有无，设备利用率也能提高，于是合并成七个较大的全能厂；另外有少数为郊区农民修理水车的铁工厂以及修理马车的工厂，都继续实行单独生产，直接为群众服务。分散在近郊的砖瓦厂，因为都需要就地取原料，同时便于供应附近建筑单位，就按分散生产、分区统一管理的原则改组。缝纫刺绣业的三十九个厂店，采用了就原地分散生产、统一经营的办法，全部保持了原有的门市部，使居民定制服装还和过去一样方便。
    经过改组，各公私合营工厂都有了明确的生产经营方针，全部能按照国家建设和人民需要进行生产。各厂还初步建立和健全了各种生产管理制度，并且把大部分非生产人员转入生产，减少了非生产开支。西安市机械工业公司所属的机制金属品工厂，统一平衡和调配了机器设备，现在已经能够制造完整的产品。体育用品制造业在改组以后也已能生产成套的体育用品。汽水冰棍制造业经过改组，除增加了品种以外，汽水的成本比去年降低9.3％，产量提高三倍左右。建筑金属器材厂在改组以后，职工们能够更好地交流经验，现在已比原定时间提前半个月完成了一万多个螺丝的加工任务。
