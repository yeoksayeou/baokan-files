　　Strengthening the Party's Supervisory Work in Industrial, Mining and Transportation Departments
    With the emergence of the high tide of socialist transformation of agriculture, capitalist industry and commerce, and handicrafts, a new high tide of industrial construction has also emerged. The industrial, mining, and transportation departments have extensively launched socialist labor competitions, striving to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it. In order to fully exert the leading role of Party organizations in industrial, mining, and transportation departments in this movement, it is necessary to eliminate all factors that are detrimental to the role of Party organizations. Therefore, strengthening the Party's supervisory work in industrial, mining, and transportation departments, strictly enforcing Party discipline, and opposing and preventing certain Party organizations and members from violating the Party's policies and discipline and harming production in industrial construction are of extremely urgent significance.
    However, up to now, not all Party organizations in industrial, mining, and transportation departments have paid attention to the Party's supervisory work. Some industrial, mining, and transportation departments have not yet established Party supervisory bodies; some industrial, mining, and transportation departments, although they have established Party supervisory bodies, have not equipped them with full-time cadres; some, although they have equipped them with cadres, the quality of the cadres equipped is too low, or many cadres have to concurrently perform other tasks and cannot be dedicated. As a result, some Party supervisory bodies exist in name only. Therefore, many serious violations of Party discipline and problems that harm production cannot be checked and handled in a timely manner, seriously hindering the completion of the national production plan.
    An important reason why the Party's supervisory work in industrial, mining, and transportation departments cannot be universally carried out is that the Party committees of some units still lack a deep understanding of the important role of the Party's supervisory work. They believe that "this work is simple"; some people also believe that since state-owned industrial, mining, and transportation enterprises are socialist enterprises, class struggle is not reflected in the enterprises, let alone in the Party organizations in the enterprises, and the Party's supervisory work is "dispensable." Therefore, they do not include the Party's supervisory work on their agenda, and do not give active support and guidance to the struggle to carry out supervisory work and oppose bad people and bad things. Their viewpoint is actually a viewpoint that ignores Party discipline and weakens the Party's supervisory work. They have forgotten: first, the struggle against bad people and bad things is a long-term task, and this struggle will continue to exist in socialist and communist societies; second, the ideological influence of the exploiting classes does not disappear rapidly with the elimination of the classes, and at present, since the exploiting classes have not yet been eliminated, their ideological influence cannot be ignored even more; third, imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a small number of domestic reactionaries are also doing everything possible to carry out various acts of sabotage against the revolutionary cause, and the industrial, mining, and transportation departments and the Party organizations in these departments are precisely one of the main targets of sabotage by these counter-revolutionary elements. Counter-revolutionary elements are using various methods to seduce Party members into doing bad things, or pretending to be progressive elements to sneak into the Party. Under these circumstances, can it be said that the Party's supervisory work is dispensable? It is true that in industrial construction, the vast majority of Party organizations and members in industrial, mining, and transportation departments are actively striving to lead the workers to overcome all difficulties and strive to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it. However, it must not be ignored that in many Party organizations and members, many serious violations of Party discipline and events that harm production have also occurred, and some bad people and bad things have emerged. Some Party members, in order to fraudulently obtain personal honors and bonuses, do not hesitate to falsely report production results, conceal mistakes, and deceive the Party and the state. Some Party members have serious bureaucratic dereliction of duty, disregard the suffering and safety of workers, resulting in constant production accidents and causing significant losses. Some Party members have serious bourgeois individualism and complacency, refuse Party supervision, and even regard the enterprises they manage as personal "independent kingdoms," undermining Party unity and violating the Party's principle of collective leadership. Some Party members are right-leaning and numb, and employ counter-revolutionary elements and other bad elements; even after counter-revolutionary elements and bad elements are exposed by the masses, they still shield them. In addition, corrupt and degenerate behavior, embezzlement and theft, and violations of laws and regulations also occur frequently among some Party members. All these facts fully show that the toxins of bourgeois ideology are corroding the Party's body and combat effectiveness in some industrial, mining, and transportation departments, hindering the smooth realization of the national plan. This serious situation shows that the Party's supervisory work must be established in industrial, mining, and transportation departments, and it must be strengthened.
    The right-leaning ideology of the Party's supervisory staff is another important reason why the Party's supervisory work in some industrial, mining, and transportation departments cannot be universally carried out. The most prominent manifestation of this right-leaning ideology is that some supervisory staff members do not dare to fight against bad people and bad things that violate Party discipline and harm production. These staff members have many concerns and many "fears." What are they afraid of? Some people are afraid that carrying out the struggle against bad people and bad things "will affect production." This is obviously an unnecessary concern. Any bad people and bad things are harmful to production; the more they are not opposed, the more they harm production; only by resolutely struggling against bad people and bad things can the obstacles to the normal conduct of production be removed. Some people are afraid that after struggling against bad people and bad things, they "will be subjected to retaliation." Yes, struggling against bad people and bad things may be subject to retaliation by bad people. However, if the Party's supervisory staff members abandon the struggle because they are afraid of retaliation, this is not only a manifestation of dereliction of duty, but is also welcomed by bad people. Struggling against bad people and bad things is a matter of integrity and righteousness, and the Party and the broad masses will definitely give support. With the support of the Party and the masses, what difficulties and obstacles cannot be overcome? The Party's supervisory staff must have enough courage to stop any retaliatory behavior and overcome any retaliatory behavior. In the struggle against bad people and bad things, the Party's supervisory staff must abandon all personal considerations. Only in this way can they uphold the truth, persevere in the struggle, and ensure the smooth progress of industrial construction.
    The key to carrying out and strengthening the Party's supervisory work in industrial, mining, and transportation departments lies first of all in the Party committees' attention to this work. This means that the Party committees must not only quickly establish and improve the Party's supervisory bodies, equip them with full-time cadres within the prescribed time limit, but also regularly listen to the reports of the supervisory committees, study and analyze the erroneous tendencies of Party organizations and members in industrial, mining, and transportation departments in violating Party discipline at various stages, and specifically guide the supervisory staff to struggle against bad people and bad things.
    The Party's supervisory committees in industrial, mining, and transportation departments must formulate their own work plans under the unified planning of the Party committees and actively carry out their work. In particular, they must select typical cases of serious violations of Party discipline and harm to production, and under the specific leadership of the Party committees, handle them with great fanfare. Only in this way can the work of the Party's supervisory committees in industrial, mining, and transportation departments be carried out quickly.
    In opposing bad people and bad things, the Party's supervisory committees must also closely rely on the broad masses of Party members and workers, and give play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses of Party members and workers in opposing bad people and bad things. In this way, the Party's supervisory committees will be able to obtain infinite strength from the masses and be able to carry out mass supervisory work. The Party's supervisory staff must also frequently go deep into the workshops to understand the specific situation, handle all cases in a realistic manner, and neither give in to bad people and bad things nor wrong good people; the punishment of those who make mistakes should be serious and appropriate. All Party supervisory staff should correctly and firmly struggle against all bad people and bad things that hinder the interests of the Party and the people, and strive to safeguard the interests of the socialist economy and strive to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and overfulfill it!

### 加强工矿交通运输部门党的监察工作

　　加强工矿交通运输部门党的监察工作
    随着农业、资本主义工商业和手工业社会主义改造高潮的出现，工业建设也出现了新的高潮。工矿、交通运输部门都广泛地开展了社会主义劳动竞赛，正在为提前和超额完成五年计划而奋斗。为了充分发挥工矿、交通运输部门中党组织在这一运动中的领导作用，就必须注意消除一切不利于发挥党组织作用的因素。因此，加强工矿、交通运输部门中党的监察工作，严肃党的纪律，反对和制止某些党组织和党员在工业建设中违反党的政策和党的纪律、危害生产的现象，就有着十分迫切的意义。
    但是，直到现在为止，并不是所有的工矿、交通运输部门的党组织都注意了党的监察工作。有些工矿、交通运输部门，至今还没有建立党的监察机构；有些工矿、交通运输部门虽然建立了党的监察机构，但是没有配备专职干部；有些虽然配备了干部，但是所配备的干部的质量太低，或者有不少干部还要兼作其他工作，不能专用。结果，有些党的监察机构形同虚设，因此，许多严重违反党纪、危害生产的问题，不能及时地受到检查和处理，严重地阻碍着国家生产计划的完成。
    工矿、交通运输部门中党的监察工作不能普遍开展的一个重要原因，就在于有些单位的党委对党的监察工作的重要作用还缺乏深刻了解，他们认为“这项工作简单”；还有人认为国营工矿、交通运输企业既是社会主义企业，阶级斗争反映不到企业中来，更反映不到企业党组织中来，党的监察工作就是“可有可无”的了。因此，他们不把党的监察工作列入自己的议事日程，对开展监察工作、反对坏人坏事的斗争也不给以积极的支持和指导。他们的这种观点实际上就是一种忽视党的纪律、削弱党的监察工作的观点。他们忘记了：第一、同坏人坏事作斗争是一个长时期的任务，这种斗争在社会主义社会和共产主义社会内也还是要继续存在的；第二、剥削阶级的思想影响并不随阶级的消灭而迅速消灭，在目前，由于剥削阶级还没有消灭，他们的思想影响更加不能忽视；第三、帝国主义、国民党反动派和国内少数反动分子也正在千方百计地对革命事业进行各种破坏，而工矿、交通运输部门和这些部门中的党组织正是这些反革命分子破坏的主要目标之一。反革命分子正用各种办法勾引党员做坏事，或者假装进步分子混入党内来。在这种情况下，能说党的监察工作可有可无吗？不错，在工业建设中，工矿、交通运输部门中绝大多数党的组织和党员，都是积极努力领导职工群众克服一切困难，争取提前和超额完成五年计划的。但是，绝不能忽视在不少党组织和党员中，也发生了不少严重违反党的纪律和危害生产的事件，出现了一些坏人坏事。有的党员为了骗取个人荣誉和奖金，不惜假报生产成绩，隐瞒错误，欺骗党和国家。有的党员有严重的官僚主义失职行为，漠视工人的疾苦和安全，致使生产事故不断发生，造成重大损失。有的党员有严重的资产阶级个人主义和骄傲自满情绪，拒绝党的监督，甚至将他们所管理的企业当做个人的“独立王国”，破坏党的团结统一，违反党的集体领导原则。有的党员右倾麻痹，引用反革命分子和其他坏分子；甚至在反革命分子和坏分子被群众检举以后，还包庇他们。此外，腐化堕落、贪污盗窃、违法乱纪的行为也时常在某些党员中发生。所有这些事实都充分说明：资产阶级思想的毒素正腐蚀着一些工矿、交通运输部门中党的机体和战斗力，障碍着国家计划的顺利实现。这种严重情况说明，工矿、交通运输部门中一定要建立党的监察工作，而且一定要加强。
    党的监察工作人员的右倾思想，是一些工矿、交通运输部门中党的监察工作不能普遍开展的另一个重要原因。这种右倾思想最突出的表现，就是有些监察工作人员不敢向违反党的纪律、危害生产的坏人坏事进行斗争。这些工作人员有很多顾虑，很多“怕”。怕什么呢？有人怕开展对坏人坏事的斗争“会影响生产”。这显然是多余的担心。任何坏人坏事都是危害生产的，越不反对，就越危害生产；只有向坏人坏事作坚决的斗争，才能扫除正常进行生产的障碍。有人怕向坏人坏事作了斗争“会受到打击报复”。是的，向坏人坏事作斗争，可能会受到坏人的打击报复。但是，如果党的监察工作人员因为害怕打击报复而放弃斗争，这不但是一种失职的表现，而且正为坏人所欢迎。同坏人坏事作斗争，是光明正大、理直气壮的事情，党和广大群众一定会给以支持。有了党和群众的支持，还有什么不能克服的困难和障碍呢？党的监察工作人员要有足够的勇气来制止任何打击报复行为，战胜任何打击报复行为。在同坏人坏事作斗争中，党的监察工作人员必须抛弃一切个人的打算。只有这样，才能坚持真理，坚持斗争，保障工业建设顺利进行。
    开展和加强工矿、交通运输部门党的监察工作的关键，首先在于党委重视这一工作。这就是说，党委不但要迅速地把党的监察机构建立、健全起来，按照规定的期限配齐专职干部，而且要经常听取监察委员会的汇报，研究分析工矿、交通运输部门中党组织、党员在各个时期的违反党纪的错误倾向，具体指导监察工作人员向坏人坏事作斗争。
    工矿、交通运输部门中的党的监察委员会必须在党委统一规划下，制定自己的工作规划，积极主动地开展工作。它们特别要选择那些严重违反党纪、危害生产的典型案件，在党委具体领导下，大张旗鼓地予以处理。只有这样，工矿、交通运输部门党的监察委员会的工作，才能很快地开展。
    在反对坏人坏事的时候，党的监察委员会还必须紧密地依靠广大党员和职工群众，发挥广大党员和职工群众反对坏人坏事的积极性。这样，党的监察委员会就能够从群众中取得无限力量，并且能够展开群众性的监察工作。党的监察工作人员还必须经常深入车间，了解具体情况，实事求是地处理一切案件，既不要在坏人坏事的面前退让，也不要冤枉好人；对犯错误的人的处分要严肃认真、恰如其分。一切党的监察工作人员，都应当正确地坚定地向一切妨碍党和人民利益的坏人坏事进行斗争，为维护社会主义经济的利益，争取提早和超额完成第一个五年计划而奋斗！
