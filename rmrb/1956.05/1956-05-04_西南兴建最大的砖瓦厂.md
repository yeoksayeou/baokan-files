Southwest Builds Largest Brick and Tile Factory

    The largest mechanized brick and tile factory in Southwest China—the Chengdu No. 3 Mechanized Brick and Tile Factory—has begun construction.

    In order to start supplying red bricks as soon as possible, the factory is carrying out production preparations and capital construction simultaneously. The work of preparing the original mud is already underway, and some brick machines will be able to produce brick blanks in May.

    After this mechanized brick and tile factory is fully completed and put into production in August this year, it will become a large factory with four 42-door tunnel kilns and six brick-making machines. It can increase Chengdu's brick production by 2.4 times compared to last year, initially meeting the growing need for bricks and tiles in Chengdu's capital construction. Thorough exploration has proven that the clay reserves near the factory site can supply the factory's needs for more than 20 years.

    西南兴建最大的砖瓦厂
    西南最大的机制砖瓦厂——成都市第三机制砖瓦厂，已经开工兴建。
    为了早日开始供应红砖，这个厂的生产准备工作和基本建设同时进行。现在原泥打方工作已经开始，五月份部分砖机就能生产砖胚。
    这座机制砖瓦厂在今年八月全部建成投入生产以后，将成为拥有四座四十二门轮窑和六部制砖机的大厂，可以使成都市砖的产量比去年增加二点四倍，初步满足成都市基本建设中日益增大的砖瓦需要。经过周密的钻探证明，厂址附近的粘土贮量，可以供应工厂二十多年的需要。
