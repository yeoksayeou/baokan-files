Xinhua News Agency, May 11th Dispatch - According to a Reuters report, former British Conservative Prime Minister Winston Churchill said in Aachen, West Germany, on the 10th: "True European unity must include Russia."

Churchill went to West Germany to receive the "Charlemagne Prize," which rewards contributions to the cause of "European unity." He made this speech after accepting the award. West German President Heuss and Adenauer also attended the award ceremony.

In his speech, Churchill defended the establishment of the North Atlantic bloc and believed that this "grand alliance of European countries linked to Canada and the United States" was important. At the same time, he practically admitted that, due to the current policies of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, the anti-Soviet stance of the North Atlantic bloc was already unfounded.

Churchill said: "I see no reason why, under these circumstances, a new Russia cannot be united in spirit with this solemn agreement (NATO). We should be clear about how deeply Russia is concerned about the security of its territory, fearing foreign invasion... I say again, it is not necessary to exclude Russia and the Eastern European countries from this treaty. At that time, it would be entirely possible to solve the major problems that trouble us (the most important of which is the reunification of Germany) more easily than if they were solved by groups standing opposed to each other with suspicion and hostility."

Churchill also said: "If we intend to use any crude methods to solve the problem of European unity—the most important part of which is the reunification of Germany—then we are reckless and should be blamed. We must avoid violence."

    丘吉尔说真正的欧洲统一必须有苏联参加
    但同时又为建立北大西洋集团辩护
    新华社11日讯　据路透社报道，前英国保守党首相丘吉尔十日在西德的亚琛说：“真正的欧洲统一必须有俄国参加。”
    丘吉尔到西德去是为了接受奖励对“欧洲统一”事业的贡献的“查理曼大帝奖金”的。他在接受奖金以后发表了这个演说。西德总统豪斯和阿登纳也参加了颁发奖金典礼。
    丘吉尔在演说中为建立北大西洋集团辩护，并且认为这个“同加拿大和美国有联系的欧洲国家大联盟”很重要。同时，他实际上承认，由于苏联和人民民主国家目前的政策，北大西洋集团采取反苏方针已经毫无根据了。
    丘吉尔说：“我看不出有什么理由，在这种情况下，新的俄国不能够同这个郑重的协定（北大西洋公约组织）的精神联结在一起。我们应当明了，俄国是多么深切地耽心本国领土的安全，唯恐遭到外国的侵袭。……我再说一遍，把俄国和东欧国家排斥在这个条约之外，是没有必要的。到那个时候，要解决使我们感到棘手的重大问题（其中最重大的是重新统一德国的问题），就会比由那些抱着猜疑和仇视的态度相互对立的集团来解决来得容易，这是完全可能的。”
    丘吉尔还说：“如果我们打算用什么粗暴的方法来解决欧洲团结问题——其中最重要的一个部分是德国的重新统一问题——那末，我们就是冒失和应该受到责备的。我们必须避免暴力。”
