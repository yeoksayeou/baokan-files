Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th—Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama stated on May 18th that, if necessary, he would be willing to go to the Soviet Union to discuss the issue of restoring diplomatic relations between the two countries.

Hatoyama also reiterated that he would be willing to meet with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai. However, this meeting would be in the future, not in the immediate future. He added that he would not shrink from meeting with Premier Zhou Enlai in Beijing, depending on the circumstances.

Hatoyama made these remarks in response to questions from Socialist Party member Kanemitsu Hosako during a Senate Cabinet Committee meeting. Hosako asked Hatoyama whether he would be willing to personally go to the Soviet Union and China to conduct talks on the issue of restoring normal relations.
