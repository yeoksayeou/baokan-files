　　The method of purchasing grain by installments at fixed times should be abolished
　　Editor:
　　Recently, some districts in Wuhan City have implemented a method of purchasing grain by installments at fixed times. This method fixes the time for each household to purchase grain each month to a specific day and time. This method was just implemented, and the Yangtze River Daily and the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee received many letters from the public. They all questioned: Why was everyone's opinion not sought in advance? Why don't the relevant leading authorities consider the difficulties of the masses? A woman surnamed Zhang said: "We get paid on the 7th of April, but the stipulated time for purchasing grain is the 6th, so we cannot buy grain." The Finance and Trade Office of the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee believes that the opinions of the masses are correct and has notified all districts to stop implementing this method.
　　As far as I know, the method of purchasing grain by installments at fixed times was proposed by the grain department to be promoted throughout the province. It is said that its benefit is to reduce crowding when purchasing grain. However, the grain supply work is related to the lives of the broad masses of the people, and it must be based on the principle of convenience for the masses to purchase. The correct approach to reducing crowding when purchasing grain should be to improve the work of the supply department and overcome the shortcomings of uneven supply quantities, complicated procedures, low work efficiency, and poor service quality in grain stores. For example, if some grain stores in Wuhan City simply cancel the procedure of recording card accounts when selling grain, they can double the efficiency of purchasing grain, and each grain store can also free up one person. Requiring residents to purchase grain by installments at fixed times is a practice that is divorced from the masses and should be corrected.

### 应该取消分期定时购买粮食的办法

　　应该取消分期定时购买粮食的办法
　　编辑同志：
    最近武汉市有些区实行了一种分期定时购买粮食的办法；这个办法就是把各户居民每月购粮的时间分日分时固定下来。这个办法刚刚执行，长江日报和武汉市人民委员会就收到很多群众来信。他们都质问：这件事为什么不事先征求一下大家的意见呢？有关领导机关为什么不体贴群众的困难呢？有一位姓张的妇女说：“我们四月份是七日发薪，可是规定的购粮时间却是六日，结果就无法购买粮食。”武汉市人民委员会财粮贸办公室认为群众的意见是对的，已经通知各区停止实行这个办法。
    据我了解，分期定时购买粮食的办法是粮食部门提出来要全省各地推广的，据说其好处是减少购粮拥挤现象。但是，粮食供应工作关系着广大人民的生活，必须以方便群众购买为原则。减少购粮拥挤现象的正确做法，应该是改进供应部门的工作，克服粮店供应数量不均衡、手续制度繁琐、工作效率不高、服务质量不好等缺点。像武汉市有些粮店只要取消卖粮时记卡片账这一道手续，就可以提高购粮效率一倍，每个粮店还可以多出一个人力。要居民分期定时购粮是脱离群众的做法，应该纠正。  陈绍鼎
