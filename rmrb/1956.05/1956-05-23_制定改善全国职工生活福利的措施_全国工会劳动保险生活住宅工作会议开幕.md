    Formulating Measures to Improve the Living Welfare of Workers Nationwide
    National Trade Union Labor Insurance, Living, and Housing Work Conference Opens

    The National Trade Union Labor Insurance, Living, and Housing Work Conference opened in Beijing on the 21st. This conference will, based on the principles of necessity and possibility, formulate measures to further improve the living welfare of workers nationwide.

    Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a report at the conference. He pointed out that gradually improving the lives of the working masses on the basis of developing production is a major policy of the Party and the government, and also a major responsibility of the trade unions. After the criticism of economism in trade union work in 1953, although trade union work was further oriented towards production and achieved certain successes in mass production, there was also a tendency to neglect the lives of the masses. He said that this shortcoming should now be seriously criticized, the bureaucratic work style in trade union work should be thoroughly overcome, and effective measures should be formulated to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings.

    Lai Ruoyu then pointed out that this conference will study and propose suggestions on revising the Labor Insurance Regulations, and study ways to gradually resolve issues related to the housing, medical care, hardship allowances, canteens and living supplies, nurseries, and other welfare issues for the working masses.

    Lai Ruoyu said that gradually resolving the various living welfare issues of the working masses on the basis of developing production, so that the working masses are concerned about the fruits of their labor from a material point of view, is not only in line with the personal interests of the working masses, but also in line with the interests of the entire country. This will surely further inspire and promote the labor enthusiasm and socialist initiative of the broad masses of workers, which is of great significance for deeply developing the advanced producer movement and completing the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

    Responsible cadres from national industrial trade unions and local trade unions attended the conference. Representatives from various ministries of the Central Government and people's committees of provinces (cities) and autonomous regions also attended the conference. Organizational departments of the Communist Party of China in various provinces (cities) were also invited to attend the conference. (Xinhua News Agency)

    制定改善全国职工生活福利的措施
    全国工会劳动保险生活住宅工作会议开幕
    全国工会劳动保险生活住宅工作会议二十一日在北京开幕。这次会议将根据必要和可能的原则，制定出进一步改善全国职工生活福利的措施。
    中华全国总工会主席赖若愚在会议上作了报告。他指出，在发展生产的基础上逐步改善职工群众的生活，是党和政府的重大政策，也是工会的重大责任。1953年批判了工会工作中的经济主义倾向以后，虽然使工会工作进一步面向生产了，在群众生产中取得了一定的成绩，但是又产生了不关心群众生活的偏向。他说，现在应该严肃地批判这一缺点，彻底地克服工会工作中的官僚主义作风，并且要拟订出克服上述缺点的有效措施。
    赖若愚接着指出，这次会议将研究提出关于修改劳动保险条例的建议，并且对职工群众的住宅、医疗、困难补助、食堂和生活供应、托儿所和其他有关职工生活福利问题，要研究出逐步解决的办法。
    赖若愚说，在发展生产的基础上逐步解决职工群众的各项生活福利问题，使职工群众从物质利益上关心自己的劳动成果，不但符合职工群众的个人利益，而且符合整个国家的利益。这必将进一步鼓舞和发扬广大职工群众的劳动热情和社会主义积极性，对于深入开展先进生产者运动，提前完成第一个五年计划有着重大意义。
    参加这次会议的，有全国各产业工会和地方工会的负责干部。中央各部、各省（市）、自治区人民委员会，也派人参加了这次会议。中国共产党各省（市）组织也应邀派人出席了这次会议。　（新华社）
