    Preserving and Developing Special Handicrafts of the Capital
    卞协
    Beijing's special handicrafts have a long history. Their products are exquisite, beautiful, and full of national style, enjoying a high reputation internationally. However, before liberation, due to the cruel exploitation and oppression of handicraftsmen by imperialism and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, not only could their skills not be developed, but they also declined day by day. By the time of liberation, some industries were on the verge of extinction. According to a comprehensive survey conducted by the Beijing Handicraft Production Cooperative Union at the end of 1954, among the eighteen natural industries such as ivory and jade, there were still 163 artisans with relatively high skills, but due to being forced by life, some had already changed careers, and some had left production to become antique dealers. This created the following problems: First, due to the change of careers of artisans, some natural industries, such as pulled thread embroidery, inside-painted snuff bottles, and iron fireworks, had no production; second, artisans who were still engaged in handicraft production and capable of doing fine work showed a declining artistic level of special crafts due to low production morale; third, before liberation, artisans were forced by life and unable to train apprentices. After liberation, they were afraid of being labeled as capitalists and did not accept apprentices. The production cooperatives had just been organized and absorbed very few apprentices, resulting in a lack of new forces to inherit the skills; fourth, artisans kept their skills secret, and the essence of various skills was mostly in the minds, hands, and eyes of the old artisans. Each old artisan had a unique skill, and the loss of one old artisan meant the extinction of a special skill.
    In response to these problems, and in accordance with the principle of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China on fundamentally preserving and developing the special handicrafts of the capital, and the policy of recruiting old artisans to preserve unique skills and train apprentices, the Beijing Handicraft Production Cooperative Union began to strengthen its leadership over special handicraft work in 1955, focusing on the following tasks and achieving significant results.
    First, helping old artisans return to the ranks, so that the old artisans who had changed careers could resume their original production. Based on the comprehensive survey materials, at the beginning of 1955, the original pulled thread embroidery artisans who had changed careers to sewing and joined the sewing cooperatives were organized into a separate pulled thread embroidery production group; the inside-painted snuff bottle artisan Ye Fengqi, who had changed careers to work as a miscellaneous worker in a middle school, and the dough figurine old artisan Lang Shaoan, who had changed careers to sell sweet potatoes, were placed in the Handicraft Management Department; the elderly ivory carving artisan Wang Bin and lacquer carving artisan Wu Yingxuan were hired as technical instructors for the ivory and lacquer carving cooperatives respectively. This arrangement not only restored the production of pulled thread embroidery, inside-painted snuff bottles, and dough figurines, three types of arts and crafts that had not been produced for many years, but also increased the technical guidance force for the ivory and lacquer carving types of arts and crafts.
    Second, improving the political and material treatment of old artisans. In order to set an example and encourage old artisans to give play to their enthusiasm and creativity, among the 163 artisans with better skills in eighteen natural industries such as ivory, jade, gilding, lacquer carving, velvet and silk paper flowers, carpets, palace lanterns, Xiang embroidery, fireworks, inside-painted snuff bottles, models, and dough figurines, twenty-seven outstanding old artisans were selected as the backbone. Among them, ivory old artisan Yang Shihui, jade old artisan Liu Deying, velvet and silk paper flower old artisan Jin Yulin, and enamel old artisan Zhang Dianhong were selected as members of the Beijing Municipal Political Consultative Conference; other old artisans were generally selected as directors of cooperatives or heads of technical research associations, and eleven old artisans participated in Party classes. At the same time, the wages of old artisans were also initially adjusted according to their technical specialties and the artistic value of their products. This greatly improved the awareness and work enthusiasm of the old artisans. The jade old artisan Liu Deying rarely rested even on holidays; the lacquer carving old artisan Wu Yingxuan was originally assigned to do half-day technical guidance work, but he worked all day and participated in the creation of new products. The conscious enthusiastic labor of the old artisans also greatly encouraged the labor enthusiasm of all members, who generally reflected: the old artisans are still working so vigorously and studying techniques so hard, we should work harder. Therefore, in the past year, the cooperatives have achieved remarkable results in improving the output and quality of products and reducing costs. For example, the output of the ivory cooperative increased by more than 10% compared with 1954, and the quality increased by 35% compared with 1954; the working hours of the jade cooperative to make hibiscus stone figures were reduced by one-third on the premise of ensuring quality.
    Third, organizing cooperation between old artisans and artists, as well as between old artisans, and establishing a joint arts and crafts cooperative to specifically lead the technical work of special crafts. In the past year, through inviting artists to visit and guide production workshops, providing samples, and organizing technical research associations, old artisans have made new achievements from technical theory to the creation of new works. For example, the stone carving cooperative used to only make products exclusively for people to appreciate, but now it has turned to producing art table lamps; six old ivory artisans jointly created twenty-nine new works reflecting reality with ideological and artistic value. The ivory old artisan Yang Shihui is currently creating large-scale works of art; the jade old artisan Xu Maolin has also learned new techniques.
    Fourth, organizing the work of imparting skills and training apprentices. In the past year, under the inspiration of the cooperative, the old artisans have actively imparted their skills, and the skills of intermediate technicians and apprentices have been significantly improved. For example, in the ivory cooperative, twenty-five intermediate technicians have learned the complete set of ivory carving techniques; in the first jade cooperative, twelve intermediate technicians have learned to do fine work such as coral, and eight intermediate technicians have learned to do turquoise work. In terms of training apprentices, the results are even more significant. In 1955, in the six cooperatives of the four natural industries of ivory, jade, lacquer carving, and enamel, which urgently needed successors, fifty apprentices were recruited. In the past year, through technical lectures, technical appraisals, and intermediate technicians teaching techniques, these apprentices have generally reached the technical level that used to take three years to learn.

    保存和发展首都的特种工艺
    卞协
    北京的特种工艺，历史悠久，产品精巧美丽，富有民族风格，并且在国际上享有盛名。但是解放以前，由于手工艺人遭受帝国主义和官僚资产阶级的残酷盘剥和压迫，技艺不但无法发挥，而且日趋衰退，快到解放的时候，有些行业已经人亡艺绝。根据北京市手工业生产合作社联合总社1954年年底的全面调查，在象牙、玉器等十八个自然行业中，技艺较高的艺人虽然还有163人，但是他们因被生活所迫，有的早就转了业，有的脱离生产当了古玩商人。这样就产生了以下几个问题：一、由于艺人的转业，有些自然行业如戳纱、内画壶、铁花等，无人生产；二、仍从事手工艺生产的、能做精细活的艺人，因为生产情绪不高，使特种工艺品的艺术水平呈现出日渐衰退的现象；三、解放以前，艺人被生活所迫，无力培养徒工，解放以后因怕戴资本家的帽子不收徒工，生产合作社刚组织起来，吸收的徒工又很少，因而缺乏继承技艺的新生力量；四、艺人们对技艺保守秘密，各种技艺的精华大部分是放在老艺人的心里和手、眼之间，每一个老艺人各有一门特长，少一个老艺人就有绝一门专技的危险。
    针对这些问题，根据中共北京市委关于从根本上保存和发展首都特种工艺的原则，和罗致老艺人保存绝技、培养徒工的方针，北京市手工业生产合作社联合总社从1955年开始加强对特种工艺工作的领导，着重做了这几项工作，取得了显著的成绩。
    首先，帮助老艺人归队，使已经转业的老艺人恢复原来的生产。根据全面调查的材料，在1955年年初，将转业从事缝纫并且参加了缝纫合作社的原戳纱艺人，单独组织了一个戳纱生产小组；将转业到某中学做杂工的内画壶艺人叶奉琪、转业卖白薯的面人老艺人郎绍安，安置在手工业经理部；聘请年老的象牙雕刻艺人王彬和雕漆艺人吴盈轩担任了象牙、雕漆两合作社的技术指导。对艺人这样安排以后，不仅恢复了多年来无人从事生产的戳纱、内画壶、面人三个类型的工艺美术品生产，并且增加了象牙、雕漆两类型工艺美术的技术指导力量。
    其次，提高老艺人的政治待遇和物质待遇。为了树立榜样和鼓励老艺人发挥积极性和创造性，在象牙、玉器、镏金、雕漆、绒绢纸花、地毯、宫灯、湘绣、花炮、内画壶、模型、面人等十八个自然行业的163个技艺较好的艺人中，选拔了二十七个优秀的老艺人作为骨干，其中象牙老艺人杨士惠、玉器老艺人刘德瀛、绒绢纸花老艺人金玉林、珐琅老艺人张殿洪等四人，被选聘为北京市政治协商委员会委员；其他老艺人一般都被选为合作社的理事或技术研究会的负责人，还有十一个老艺人参加了党课学习。同时，对于老艺人的工资，也分别根据他们的技艺特长和产品艺术价值进行了初步调整。这样就大大提高了老艺人们的觉悟程度和工作热情。玉器老艺人刘德瀛甚至假日也很少休息；雕漆老艺人吴盈轩本来被分配作半日的技术指导工作，可是他整日工作，并且参加了创作新产品的工作。老艺人们这种自觉的热情劳动，也大大鼓舞了全体社员的劳动积极性，社员普遍反映：老艺人干活还那样起劲，钻研技术那么下工夫，我们更应该好好地干了。因而一年来各合作社在提高产品的产量和质量以及降低成本等方面，都取得了显著的成绩。如象牙合作社的产量比1954年提高了10％以上，质量比1954年提高了35％；玉器合作社做芙蓉石人的工时，在保证质量的前提下，减少了三分之一。
    第三，组织老艺人和美术家之间以及老艺人之间的合作，并且成立了工艺美术品联社，专门领导特种工艺 的技术工作。一年来，通过邀请美术家到生产车间参观指导、供给样品、组织技术研究会等方式，使老艺人从技术理论到新作品创作，都取得了新的成就。如石刻合作社从前只做专供人们欣赏的产品，现在已经转到生产美术台灯；象牙合作社六个老艺人协同创作了二十九件反映现实的富有思想性和艺术价值的新作品，象牙老艺人杨士惠目前正在创作大件艺术品；玉器老艺人许茂林还学会了新的技术。
    第四，组织传授技艺和培养徒工的工作。一年来，在合作社的启发下，老艺人都积极传授技艺，中等技工和学徒工的技术得到了显著的提高。如象牙合作社有二十五个中等技工学会了象牙雕刻的全套技术；第一玉器合作社有十二个中等技工学会了做珊瑚等精细活，八个中等技工学会了做松石活。在培养学徒工方面，成绩更显著。1955年，在迫切需要继承人的象牙、玉器、雕漆、珐琅等四种自然行业的六个合作社中，吸收了五十名学徒工。一年来通过讲技术课、技术鉴定和中等技工包教技术等方式，这些学徒工一般都达到了过去学习三年才能达到的技术水平。（附图片）
    为了改进和提高工艺美术品的质量，北京市工艺美术品生产合作社联合社筹备委员会曾先后举办了玉器、象牙和珐琅专业小型观摩座谈会。这是珐琅专业的座谈会。　本报记者　袁毅平　王志渊摄
