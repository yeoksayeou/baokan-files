    Doing the Work of the First Quarter of Next Year

    In early May, Wang Zuoshan, a grinder at the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant's Tool Workshop, made a guarantee to the Party: he would complete the production tasks for the first quarter of next year ahead of schedule in May. On April 28th, he had already completed the production tasks for January of next year.

    In the advanced producer movement, Wang Zuoshan learned from Hu Nianrong's pioneering spirit of increasing efficiency thirtyfold. He repeatedly improved his operating methods and put forward two rationalization proposals. He increased the depth of cut, reducing the number of grinding passes by three each time he ground round steel, thereby improving efficiency. He also used high-speed cutting methods to speed up the machine tool's rotation. He said, "Let's work quickly so that domestically produced cars can be produced sooner!" (Huang Ming)

    干明年第一季度的活
    五月初，第一汽车制造厂工具一车间磨工王作山向党提出保证：在五月里提前完成明年第一季度的生产任务。四月二十八日，他已经完成了明年一月份的生产任务。
    在先进生产者运动中，王作山学习胡年荣提高效率三十倍的首创精神，三番五次地改进操作方法，提出两件合理化建议。他加大了进刀量，在每次磨元硝的时候，比过去少磨三遍，提高了效率。他又运用高速切削的方法，加快了机床转数。他说：“咱们快快干，国产汽车就能早出厂了！”　　（黄明）
