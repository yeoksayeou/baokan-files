Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The All-China Journalists Association held a reception on the 2nd to welcome the Indonesian Journalists Delegation.

    Wu Lengxi, Vice President of the All-China Journalists Association, said in his welcoming speech at the reception that Chinese and Indonesian journalists have common goals. Since the Asian-African Conference last year, the relationship between the press circles of China and Indonesia has become closer. It is hoped that the visit to China by the journalists delegation headed by Aziz will further enhance friendly contacts between the press circles and the peoples of the two countries.

    Aziz, head of the Indonesian Journalists Delegation, then spoke. He said: We, as representatives of the voice of the people, are visiting China this time not only for sightseeing and visits, but also to establish more direct contact with Chinese journalists. The different national systems of Indonesia and China cannot hinder cooperation between the two countries, nor can it hinder cooperation between journalists of the two countries.

    The reception took place in a cordial and warm atmosphere.

    我国新闻工作者联谊会欢宴印度尼西亚新闻工作者代表团
    新华社2日讯　中国新闻工作者联谊会二日举行酒会，欢迎印度尼西亚新闻工作者代表团。
    中国新闻工作者联谊会副会长吴冷西在酒会上致欢迎词说，中国和印度尼西亚两国的新闻工作者有共同的目标。自从去年亚非会议以后，中国和印度尼西亚的新闻界的关系更加密切了。希望这次以阿齐兹为首的新闻工作者代表团的访问中国，能够更加增进两国新闻界和两国人民之间友谊的接触。
    印度尼西亚新闻工作者代表团团长阿齐兹接着讲话。他说：我们作为代表人民的声音的人这一次来访问中国，不但是为了参观访问，而且是为了与中国的新闻工作者进行更直接的联系。印度尼西亚和中国国家制度的不同，不能妨碍两国之间进行合作，同样，也不能妨碍两国新闻工作者之间的合作。
    酒会在亲切热烈的气氛中进行。
