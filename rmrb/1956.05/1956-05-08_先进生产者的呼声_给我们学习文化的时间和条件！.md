Advanced Producers' Voices

　　Give us the time and conditions to study culture!
　　Promises should be kept
　　Stop letting learning be started but not finished
　　Editor:

　　During this National Textile Industry Advanced Producers Representative Conference, I learned a lot. At the same time, I deeply realized that if we workers don't quickly learn culture and science, it will be impossible to build our country well.

　　However, the mention of learning culture makes people feel depressed. Our Jin Sheng Textile Factory in Shanxi Province organizes cultural learning every year, but every year the learning cannot be sustained. Take last year as an example. When the spare-time school first started, the leaders were very enthusiastic. At the opening ceremony, Party Branch Secretary Li Dewang gave a speech, guaranteeing that no one could take up the time for cultural classes every Tuesday and Wednesday! Who knew that not long after the start of the semester, the factory had urgent tasks and movements. After a month, learning had collapsed, but no one came to ask about it again. In the second half of 1954, I started studying in the first class of higher primary school, learning the "Arithmetic Textbook for Employees' Spare-time Schools," Volume 1, but to this day, I am still learning this same volume.

　　We have raised these opinions to the Party Branch, the administration, and the trade union, and we have raised them more than three or five times, but there has been no practical effect. Last summer, our factory inspected leadership work, and the workers criticized this phenomenon and proposed some improvement measures. The leading comrades made a public self-criticism at a general meeting of all employees and made guarantees to improve their work. We thought that this time the problem would be solved. Who knew that this time it was just thunder and no rain, and soon after, everything was calm again!

　　The Party Central Committee called on workers to improve their culture in order to advance towards science. But after a long time, there was still no movement in our factory. This time, the workers' enthusiasm for learning could no longer be suppressed. Many people went to the spare-time schools run by the streets to study. Some lived far away and didn't have time to go home for meals, so they went to class first and ate later. Because the schools were well organized, the workers made rapid progress in their studies. Wang Yulian had been studying in the factory for several years and was still semi-literate and didn't understand arithmetic; but now she can not only write, but also make plans and has learned mixed four-arithmetic operations. It's really infuriating to say that studying in the factory for several years is not as fruitful as studying outside for a few months!

　　In late March this year, the leaders of our factory organized employee cultural learning again. They stipulated that Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays were the times for cultural classes, and could not be arbitrarily occupied. However, many people have no confidence in the guarantees of the leaders. Comrades studying outside the factory said: "We'll come back when the factory's cultural learning classes are well run!" I hope that the leaders of our factory will not be like they were in the past this time, and they should use practical actions to gain the trust of the workers!

　　Reduce meetings and activities so workers can go to class
　　Editor:

　　I am a mechanical mining worker from Jinling Iron Mine in Shandong Province. I want to talk about the issue of our workers learning culture.

　　Regarding the issue of workers learning culture, it seems that our mine also attaches great importance to it, with calls and instructions; unfortunately, saying is one thing, doing is another, and the leaders have not solved specific problems for everyone.

　　We don't have time to learn culture. From Monday to Saturday, there are meetings almost every day: Monday is Party and Youth League activities, Tuesday is to arrange the tasks for the week, Wednesday is to summarize the work of the previous week, Thursday is the team safety inspection, and Saturday is again Party and Youth League activities; although there are no fixed meetings on Fridays, either the Party Branch Secretary makes a report or the trade union assigns tasks, and it is rarely left idle! These meetings take one or two hours. Workers on the early shift get off work at 2 p.m. and have class at 4:30 p.m.; after the shift change, showering, changing clothes, and then attending several hours of meetings, how can they make it to class!

　　We also don't have a place to study. The leaders designated the mine's employee children's school as the classroom for workers' cultural classes, but the place is small and can't accommodate everyone; and when classes are held at noon, the surroundings are very noisy, making it impossible to concentrate on listening. There isn't even a table in our dormitory. When we go back to the dormitory to review our lessons, we have to lie on the bed to write a few words!

　　Also, our cultural teacher is part-time. When he has a meeting, he can't come to class. Because of this, the workers' learning is also greatly affected.

　　The country's socialist construction increasingly requires us workers to master culture and technology. But two-thirds of the workers in our mine are illiterate. If the leaders don't solve some problems for everyone and guarantee that everyone can learn culture well, then it will definitely affect production in the future.

　　Representative of the First Heavy Industry Department Advanced Producers Conference

　　Not only should the importance of learning be publicized, but employees should also have time to learn
　　Editor:

　　I want to tell the People's Daily what's on my mind, which is: we demand time to study culture.

　　I am a pneumatic drill operator from Nantong Coal Mine in Sichuan Province. I have been working in this mine since 1953. From that time on, I have constantly heard the leaders talk about the importance of learning culture. These words sound reasonable, but the problem of our lack of time to learn has not been solved.

　　Our work is in three shifts, which are supposed to be eight hours; because the production is poorly organized and materials are not supplied, we often have to work two or three hours overtime. Those on the early shift are supposed to start work at 6 a.m. and get off work at 2 p.m., but we often don't get off work until 4 p.m. After the shift change, showering, changing clothes, and eating takes at least an hour, and we can't make it to class.

　　In addition, meetings take up a lot of our time. The mine's fixed meetings include: the production inspection meeting on Wednesday, the safety inspection meeting on Thursday, the production team meeting on Friday, and the Party and Youth League activities on Saturday. I am an advanced producer, as well as the Party team leader and production team leader, so there are even more meetings. Even if I can go to cultural classes on Monday and Tuesday, I don't have time to review!

　　We don't know how many times we have raised these issues to the leaders of the mine, and the reply is always "The problem is difficult to solve at present, we'll talk about it later." After dragging on for several years, there is still no guarantee of learning time.

　　This time, the Party is calling on us to advance towards culture, and the workers' enthusiasm for learning is even greater than before. I have made up my mind to remove the label of illiteracy in the next two years, to reach the level of a seventh-grade worker this year, and the level of an eighth-grade worker next year. Other workers also have their own plans. I hope that the leaders of our mine can see this, organize production better, and arrange meeting times so that we have time to study culture.

### 先进生产者的呼声  给我们学习文化的时间和条件！

　　先进生产者的呼声
    给我们学习文化的时间和条件！
    提出保证就应该兑现
    别再让学习有头无尾
　　编辑同志：
    在这次全国纺织工业先进生产者代表会议的期间，我学习到不少东西。同时，我也深深体会到，我们工人要不马上学好文化，学好科学，要把咱们国家建设好是不可能的。
    可是，一提起学文化，就叫人感到苦闷。我们山西省晋生纺织厂年年都组织文化学习，可是年年学习都不能坚持。拿去年来说吧，业余学校刚开学的时候，领导同志的劲头可大啦。在开学典礼上，党支部书记李德望给大家讲了话，保证每星期二、三上文化课的时间谁也不能侵占！谁知道开学没有多久，厂里紧急任务和运动就来了。一个月过后，学习已经垮了，但再也没人来过问。1954年下半年开始我上高小一班学习，算术课学的是“职工业余学校算术课本”上册，可是到现在，我学的还是这一本。
    这些意见，我们向党支部、行政和工会都提过，而且提了不止三次、五次，可就是没有实际效果。去年夏天，我们厂里检查领导工作，工人们就对这种现象提出了批评，还提了一些改进办法。领导同志在一次全体职工大会上公开做了检讨，还提出了改进工作的保证。我们想，这一次可解决问题了。谁知道，这一回又是光打雷、不下雨，不久以后，又风平浪静了！
    党中央号召，叫工人们提高文化以便向科学进军。但是经过很久，我们厂里还是没有动静。这回，工人那股学习劲头可再也压不下去了。很多人都到街道上办的业余学校去学习了。有的路远，回家吃饭来不及，就先上课，后吃饭。因为人家学校组织得好，工人学习也进步得快。王玉莲在厂子里学习了几年还是个半文盲，算术也不懂；可是现在不光能写，还会订个计划，算术也学到四则混合题了。说起来真叫人生气，在厂里学几年，还没有在外边学习几个月收获大！
    今年三月下旬，我们厂子的领导方面又组织职工文化学习了，他们规定每星期三、四、五三天是上文化课时间，不能随意侵占。但是，很多人对领导方面的保证没有信心。在厂外学习的同志说：“等厂里面文化学习班办好了，我们再回来！”希望我们工厂的领导人这一次不要再像过去那样了，他们应该用实际行动来取得工人的信任！

    减少会议活动让工人们能去上课
　　编辑同志：
    我是山东省金岭铁矿的一个机械采矿工人。我要谈谈我们工人学文化的事情。
    对于工人学文化的事，看起来我们矿上也很重视，又是号召，又是指示；可惜的是：说归说，做归做，领导方面并没有给大家解决具体问题。
    我们没有学文化的时间。从星期一到星期六，差不多每天都要开会：星期一是党、团活动，星期二是布置本周任务，星期三是总结上周工作，星期四是小组保安检查，星期六又是党、团活动；星期五虽然没有固定的会议，但不是党支部书记做报告，就是工会布置任务，很少叫它闲起来！这些会议，一开就得一两个钟头。做早班的工人下午两点下班，四点半就要上课；交接班以后洗洗澡、换换衣服，再开上几个钟头的会，那能赶得上上课！
    我们也没有学习的地方。领导方面指定把矿上的职工子弟学校做为工人上文化课的教室，但是地方小，根本坐不下；而且中午上课的时候周围吵闹得厉害，无法安心听课。我们的宿舍里连一张桌子都没有，回宿舍复习功课，要写几个字，都得趴在床上！
    还有，我们的文化教员是兼职的。他一开会，就不能来上课。因为这，工人的学习也受到不少影响。
    国家的社会主义建设，越来越需要我们工人掌握文化和技术。可是我们矿上的工人有三分之二都是文盲。领导方面要再不给大家解决一些问题，保证大家能够好好学文化，那末将来对生产一定会有影响。

                              王纪礼
　　不仅要宣传学习重要性还要让职工有学习时间
　　编辑同志：
    我要向人民日报说一说心里话，这就是：我们要求有学习文化的时间。
    我是四川省南通煤矿的一个风镐手，1953年到这个矿工作。从那时开始，我就不断听到领导同志讲学习文化的重要性。这些话听起来头头是道，可是，我们没有学习时间的问题却没人来解决。
    我们的工作是三班倒，按规定是八小时；因为生产组织得不好，材料供应不上，我们经常要多干二、三个钟头的活。做早班的按规定是早晨六点钟上班、下午两点钟下班，可是我们经常要到下午四点钟才能下班。交班以后，洗澡、换衣服、吃饭，至少要一个多钟头，再去上课就赶不上了。
    另外，会议也占去了我们很多时间。矿上固定的会议就有：星期三的生产检查会、星期四的安全检查会，星期五的生产小组会，星期六的党、团活动。我是一个先进生产者，还是党小组长和生产小组长，那会议就更多了，即使在星期一、二能够去上文化课，回来也没有复习的时间！
    这些问题，我们不知道给矿上的领导同志提过多少遍，答复老是“目前问题难解决、以后再说”。这样一拖几年，学习时间还是没有保证。
    这次，党号召我们向文化进军，工人们学习的劲头比那个时候都足。我打好了主意，要在今明两年摘掉文盲的帽子，今年达到七级工人的水平，明年达到八级工人的水平。其他工人也都有自己的打算。希望我们矿上的领导同志能够看到这一点，把生产组织得好一些，把会议时间安排一下，让我们有学习文化的时间。
