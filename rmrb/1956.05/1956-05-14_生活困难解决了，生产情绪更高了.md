Life's Difficulties Resolved, Production Enthusiasm Even Higher
　　Zhang Jinrui
　　Production is Good, but Life Remains Difficult

　　The Bucheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Bucheng Township, Shuiye District, Anyang County, Henan Province, is an advanced cooperative established in January of this year. The cooperative has a total of 1,140 households. Over the past few months, the cooperative has achieved significant results in agricultural production. However, because the cooperative's staff only focused on leading the cooperative's production and did not pay enough attention to the lives of the cooperative members; only focused on leading agricultural production and relaxed sideline production: the income of the cooperative members decreased, and many cooperative members experienced difficulties in life.

　　After the Bucheng Agricultural Cooperative Branch of the Chinese Communist Party discovered this problem, they recognized its seriousness through analysis and research. They analyzed the specific reasons for the problem: (1) The cooperative's staff blindly tapped potential to expand investment, such as advance payments of more than 6,000 yuan for cotton throughout the cooperative, none of which was distributed to the cooperative members. (2) Last year, the cooperative planted 3,000 mu of cabbage, but due to poor management, some of it rotted, and the cooperative members' actual income decreased by about 30%. (3) In previous years, Bucheng Village mobilized more than 600 carts for transportation in winter, and there were also four brick kilns, two flour mills, five tofu workshops, four water mills, blacksmiths, carpenters, and many other sideline production avenues. The village's sideline income accounted for an average of about 35% of the total annual income. After the whole village was built into an advanced cooperative, these sideline industries were abandoned, losing a large amount of cash income. (4) Some old cooperative members bought fixed assets in the primary cooperative last year. After being transferred to the advanced cooperative, they were not returned to them in time. This caused cooperative members to be afraid to deposit money in the cooperative even if they had it. For example, cooperative member Li Zuolu had more than 200 yuan but dared not deposit it in the cooperative, and even asked the cooperative staff to borrow money from the cooperative. (5) After the transfer to the cooperative, the cooperative's staff blindly believed that "the family is big and the business is big, it doesn't matter to spend a few more dollars," and squandered wastefully, spending 342 yuan on buying cultural and recreational supplies and desks alone. After analyzing these specific facts, they believed that if no measures were taken to quickly solve these problems, it would seriously affect the development of the production campaign.

　　Sideline Occupations Can Also Be Done During the Busy Farming Season

　　The Bucheng Agricultural Cooperative Branch of the Chinese Communist Party led the cooperative staff to study Articles 23 and 24 of the National Agricultural Development Program, believing that the cooperative must not only increase production, but also increase the income of the cooperative members, and must earnestly implement the management policy of "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily" and "taking agriculture as the main industry and engaging in diversified economic activities." The cooperative also discussed the issue of arranging agricultural and sideline production and helping cooperative members solve their living difficulties. The main staff of the cooperative divided the work. Cooperative Director Li Yanlu and two sideline industry chiefs were responsible for leading sideline production, Branch Secretary Wang Shibao and two deputy cooperative directors, the financial director, etc., were responsible for leading the solution of cooperative members' living problems, and other staff members continued to lead agricultural production. Then, after checking farm work, checking attendance, and labor planning, the agricultural work for the seventy days before wheat harvesting was specifically arranged, and the labor attendance rate of the cooperative members was calculated. The cooperative had a total of 2,300 full and semi-laborers, of which 2,020 were often able to attend work. Calculated on the basis of each full laborer attending work for sixty days, a total of 76,459 workdays could be completed, and after offsetting the agricultural work, there would be a net surplus of 31,037 workdays. After this calculation, the cooperative decided to use 1,450 laborers to carry out agricultural production, and all the remaining laborers would participate in sideline production. Therefore, a unified plan was also made for sideline production. Four hundred carts and 450 laborers were drawn to transport grain for the Grain Bureau. Grain was transported from Dongyaoji, Linxian County, to Tangyin and Anyang City, earning 320 yuan per trip. In addition to transporting grain, goods were also transported to the local supply and marketing cooperative, and a total of 15,649 yuan could be earned from transportation before wheat harvesting. In addition, carpenters and blacksmiths were organized to repair farm tools, and the production of flour mills, tofu workshops, etc. was restored, with a total income of 2,162 yuan before wheat harvesting. The total income from sideline industries was 17,811 yuan.

　　Accept Rationalization Proposals from Cooperative Members

　　In order to implement the policy of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily, the cooperative staff accepted rationalization proposals from the cooperative members and adopted the following methods to overcome the difficulties of insufficient production funds. (1) Using lacquer ash and chicken manure to replace fine fertilizer. (2) Building toilets and buying urine pots to expand the source of fertilizer. (3) Collecting bran from cooperative members to solve the problem of livestock feed. (4) Collecting wheat straw and grain straw from cooperative members to be used as materials for vegetable seedling barriers. (5) Collecting scrap copper and scrap iron from cooperative members to be used as raw materials for repairing farm tools. (6) Collecting fine fertilizer accumulated by cooperative members before joining the cooperative to overcome the difficulty of insufficient fertilizer. In mobilizing cooperative members to invest, the policy of voluntary mutual benefit was also earnestly implemented. From April 10 to 14, the cooperative collected a total of 12,325 jin of lacquer ash, 11,773 jin of chicken manure, 567 jin of fertilizer powder, 375 jin of cottonseed cake, 4,569 jin of bran, 53,060 jin of wheat straw and grain straw, and more than 1,600 jin of scrap copper and scrap iron. The cooperative members received a total of 5,030 jin of edible salt and 2,316 yuan in cash from the cooperative. In this way, on the one hand, the cooperative overcame the difficulty of insufficient means of production, and on the other hand, the cooperative members also increased a portion of their income.

　　Solving Different Difficult Problems Separately

　　In order to help cooperative members solve their living difficulties, the Party branch and the cooperative management committee also classified and lined up all 1,140 households in the cooperative one by one. The results of the lining up: 110 wealthy households, 550 people; 365 self-sufficient households, 1,560 people; 415 currently difficult households, 1,725 people (including 53 extremely poor households, 119 people); 250 households that are not currently in difficulty, but may experience difficulties in half a month, 1,027 people. After classification and lining up, the staff knew which cooperative members were in difficulty and which were not; which were in difficulty now and which would be in difficulty in half a month. According to different situations, different methods were adopted to solve the difficult problems: For old cooperative members who did not receive enough of their due share last year and who have deposits in the cooperative but are now experiencing living difficulties, the cooperative should first try to repay a portion to help them solve their current living problems. Those who are old, weak, disabled, extremely poor families, have no deposits in the cooperative, and are currently experiencing very difficult lives, should be provided with relief. Those who have weak labor, are currently experiencing living difficulties, but do not meet the relief standards, should be temporarily loaned a portion of cash by the cooperative, to be repaid in the autumn without interest. Those who are temporarily experiencing living difficulties, but have very strong family labor, should be organized to go out to engage in sideline production to solve their living problems. After this arrangement, the cooperative members' current living difficulties can be completely resolved.

　　The cooperative members' living difficulties have been resolved, and their enthusiasm for production has soared. Cooperative member Liu Baizhi said: "The cooperative takes care of us really well, exchanging lacquer ash for salt and turning broken shoes into money. We must work hard in production in the future."

    生活困难解决了，生产情绪更高了
    张金瑞
    生产虽然好，生活仍困难
    河南省安阳县水冶区埠城乡埠城农业生产合作社，是今年一月建成的一个高级社。全社共有1，140户。几个月来，这个社在农业生产方面取得了显著成绩。但是，由于社的工作人员只注意了领导社的生产，没有很好关心社员的生活；只注意了领导农业生产，放松了副业生产：社员的收入减少了，不少社员的生活发生了困难。
    中共埠城农业合作社支部发现了这个问题以后，通过分析研究，认识了问题的严重性。他们分析发生这个问题的具体原因是：（1）社的工作人员盲目挖潜力扩大投资，如全社棉花预付定金六千多元，一点没有分给社员。（2）去年全社种白菜三千亩，因经营管理不善，烂了一部分，社员实际收入减少30％左右。（3）往年冬季埠城村出动六百多辆小车搞运输，还有四座砖窑、两座粉坊、五个豆腐坊、四盘水磨、铁匠、木匠等很多副业生产门路，全村副业收入平均占全年总收入的35％左右。全村建成一个高级社以后，丢掉了这些副业，失掉了大批的现金收入。（4）有些老社员去年在初级社置买的固定财产，转高级社后，没有及时还给他们。造成社员有钱也不敢往社存。如社员李作禄，有二百多元也不敢往社里存，还找社的工作人员要跟社里借钱。（5）转社后，社的工作人员盲目认为“家大业大，多花几个钱不算什么”，铺张浪费，光买文娱用品和办公桌等，就花了342元。分析了这些具体事实，他们认为如果不采取措施，迅速解决这些问题，就会严重影响生产运动的开展。
    农忙季节也能搞副业
    中共埠城农业合作社支部领导社的工作人员学习了全国农业发展纲要第二十三、二十四条，认为社里既要增加生产，又要增加社员的收入，就必须认真执行“勤俭办社”和“以农业为主兼营多种经济”的经营方针。这个社又讨论了安排农副业生产和帮助社员解决生活困难的问题。社里的主要工作人员分了工。社长李彦禄和两个副业股长等负责领导副业生产，支部书记王石保和两个副社长、财务主任等负责领导解决社员生活问题，其他工作人员仍然领导农业生产。接着又经过查农活、查出勤和劳力规划，具体安排了麦收前七十天的农活，计算了社员的劳动出勤率。全社共有整、半劳力2，300个，经常能够出勤的有2，020个。以每个整劳力出勤六十天计算，共能做76，459个工作日，和农活用工相抵后，还净余31，037个工作日。这样计算以后，这个社决定用1，450个劳力开展农业生产，下余劳力全部参加副业生产。于是，对副业生产也进行了统一规划。抽出四百辆小车、450个劳力给粮食局运粮食。由林县东窑集往汤阴和安阳市运输粮食，每趟可赚320元。运粮再加上给当地供销社运输商品，麦前共可由运输方面收入15，649元。另外还组织木匠、铁匠修补农具，恢复粉坊、豆腐坊等生产，麦前共可收入2，162元。以上总共由副业可收入17，811元。
    接受社员的合理化建议
    为了贯彻执行勤俭办社方针，社的工作人员接受社员的合理化建议，采用了下面的一些办法来克服生产资金不足的困难。（1）用漆灰、鸡粪代替细肥。（2）盖厕所、买尿罐，扩大肥料来源。（3）收集社员的麸片，解决牲口饲料问题。（4）收集社员的麦秆、谷草，用作蔬菜育苗屏障的材料。（5）搜集社员的破铜碎铁，用作修补农具的原料。（6）收集社员入社前积存的细肥，克服肥料不足的困难。在发动社员投资中还认真地贯彻执行了自愿互利政策。由四月十日至十四日，全社共收社员漆灰12，325斤，鸡粪11，773斤，肥田粉567斤，棉饼375斤，麸片4，569斤，麦秆、谷草53，060斤，碎铜碎铁一千六百多斤。社员由社里共得到了5，030斤食盐、2，316元现金的报酬。这样一方面社里克服了生产资料不足的困难，另方面社员也增加了一部分收入。
    分别地解决不同的困难问题
    为了帮助社员解决生活困难问题，党支部、社管理委员会还把全社1，140户逐户进行了分类站队。站队的结果：富裕的110户，550人；自足的365户，1，560人；当前困难的415户，1，725人（其中极贫的五十三户，119人），目前不困难，半月后可能发生困难的250户，1，027人。经过分类排队，工作人员就知道哪些社员有困难，哪些没有困难；哪些现在有困难，哪些半月以后才有困难。根据不同情况，采取了不同的解决困难问题的办法：凡老社员去年应得部分没有分够和在社内有存款而现在生活困难的户，社内应首先设法偿还一部分，帮助他们解决当前的生活问题。凡老弱残疾、家庭极贫，社内又无存款，当前生活又很困难的户，予以救济。凡劳力弱、现在生活困难，但是不够救济标准的户，由社内暂借一部分现金，秋后归还，不出利息。暂时生活困难，但是家庭劳力很强的户，组织他们出外搞副业生产，解决生活问题。经过这样安排以后，社员当前的生活困难问题完全可以解决。
    社员们的生活困难问题解决了，生产情绪高涨起来了。社员刘白只说：“社里对咱照顾的真周到，漆灰给咱换成盐，破鞋给咱变成钱，今后可要好好生产哩。”
