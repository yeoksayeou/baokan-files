    The First Friendly Match Between Chinese and Romanian Table Tennis Teams Held in Beijing

    (Our newspaper, May 2nd) China's national men's and women's table tennis teams held a friendly match with the visiting Romanian men's and women's table tennis teams at the Beijing Gymnasium on the evening of the 2nd. A total of six singles matches were played tonight, with each team winning three.

    The competition began after a welcoming ceremony.

    The first match was Sun Meiying against Romania's Zeller. Sun Meiying did not play steadily and lost both games 17-21.

    In the second match, Fu Qifang played well with long and short balls, defeating Romania's champion Harasztosi 21-19 and 21-13.

    Jiang Yongning, known for his defensive play, met Romania's Retter, who is also good at defense, tonight. Jiang Yongning's draws and pulls were very successful, and after half an hour of fierce fighting, he finally won 21-12 and 21-17.

    Rozeanu, who has won six world women's table tennis championships, changed her past defensive style tonight and easily played against Ye Peiqiong, who is also mainly defensive. She took the lead in the first game 21-14, but lost the second game 18-21 to Ye Peiqiong, but she won the third game again with 21-8.

    Although Wang Xitian's straight shots were beautiful, he ultimately lost 15-21 and 14-21 to Romania's Gantner, who is good at both defense and offense.

    Cen Huaiguang, who has always been brave, faced Romania's Popescu. He smashed and hit hard, taking the lead in both games with 21-15.

    There were more than 6,000 spectators today, including many foreign guests and representatives attending the National Conference of Advanced Producers.
