Title: No Wonder People Are Afraid of It

This is a cartoon from the Shanghai Liberation Daily on February 26th. People who don't know the situation might think that the cartoon exaggerates the quality problem of thermos bottles. In fact, for some bamboo-cased thermos bottles from units such as Shanghai Public-Private Joint Venture Jiu Cheng Thermos Factory, Xin Chang Thermos Factory, Jing Yi Thermos Factory, Xing Hua Thermos Factory, Local State-Owned Beijing Glass Factory, Changsha Jian Xiang Enamel Thermos Factory, and Chongqing Thermos Factory, it is very necessary to be constantly on guard against explosions. In Shanghai, there have been two serious accidents in which children were scalded to death due to thermos bottle explosions. As for people who dare not use thermos bottles due to too many explosions, there are even more. For example, a resident named Huang Renjie in Changsha City bought a bamboo-cased thermos bottle from Jian Xiang Enamel Thermos Factory in a consumer cooperative, and it exploded in less than two weeks. The cooperative compensated him with a new one, which exploded after only one week. The cooperative compensated him with another new one, which he used with trepidation, and it exploded after only twenty days. When the cooperative compensated him with a new thermos bottle again, he no longer had the courage to use it, and had to put it on display as a decoration. The Zhuji County Tax Bureau in Zhejiang Province bought thirteen thermos bottles, and twelve of them exploded in succession. No one dared to use the remaining one. This shows that the fear caused by thermos bottle explosions among consumers is not light.

In addition to fearing explosions, consumers are also afraid that thermos bottles are not warm enough. Some bamboo-cased thermos bottles from the factories mentioned above can only keep warm for five or six hours, while others are like ordinary kettles, and the boiling water poured in becomes cold within one or two hours. Although some factories allow the exchange of exploded and non-warming thermos bottles, many consumers dare not easily buy them because the procedures are too cumbersome and sometimes they have to queue up and wait. Some people insist on the selling stores giving a guarantee before buying. This makes the store staff also afraid of thermos bottles. Liu Gensheng, a salesman at the Caoyang New Village Cooperative in Shanghai, said: "Because the phenomenon of explosions and non-warming is serious, customers ask us if we can guarantee that it will not explode? Can we guarantee that it will keep warm?' This gives us a headache: if we say yes, it's actually not possible; if we say no, we are afraid of not completing the sales task!"

Why are a large number of exploding and non-warming thermos bottles allowed to enter the market, creating an atmosphere of fear among consumers? The fundamental reason is that since the thermos bottles were out of stock in the winter of 1953, many factories, especially newly established factories, have been producing them shoddily. The layman approach of commercial departments and lax inspection are one of the reasons. Whether the inner glass explodes or not, and whether it keeps warm or not, mainly depends on whether the ingredients are good, whether the thickness is uniform, whether the weight is sufficient, and whether the operation is good. According to a comrade from the Shanghai Purchasing Station of the China Department Store Company, they only look at the appearance of the thermos bottles leaving the factory to see if there are "water marks," "bubbles," or "silver light," which have nothing to do with explosions and warmth retention, and consumers do not pay much attention to them. Since the commercial departments only look at the appearance and guarantee sales, some factories are happy to pass off some bad products and substandard products as good products.

It is said that the quality of thermos bottles exported from our country is better. Why? Because the production and commercial departments regard this work as a major political task to be completed. Not only is special attention paid to product quality during manufacturing, but the factory and commercial departments also repeatedly inspect the finished products. It can be seen that eliminating people's fear of thermos bottles is entirely possible. Comrades in the factories that manufacture thermos bottles and the commercial departments that inspect thermos bottles, quickly eliminate people's fear of thermos bottles! (Attached picture)

A blockbuster: Clearly a thermos bottle. Why are people afraid of it? It turns out that the bottle is born strange: pour in boiling water and it explodes! (Drawn by Xu Tao of the State-Owned Shanghai No. 1 Department Store, poem by Xiao Lin)

    难怪人们要怕它
    超祺
    这是二月二十六日上海解放日报的一幅漫画。不了解情况的人，也许以为漫画把热水瓶的质量问题夸大了。其实，对于如上海公私合营久成水瓶厂、新昌水瓶厂、精益水瓶厂、兴华水瓶厂、地方国营北京玻璃厂、长沙建湘搪瓷水瓶厂、重庆水瓶厂等单位的一些竹壳热水瓶来说，随时提防爆炸是非常必要的。在上海，曾经发生过两次因热水瓶爆炸，小孩被烫伤致死的严重事故。至于因爆炸次数太多而不敢使用热水瓶的人，更大有人在。例如长沙市一位叫黄人杰的居民，在一家消费合作社里买一个建湘搪瓷水瓶厂的竹壳热水瓶，用不了两个星期就爆炸了。合作社赔他一个新的，只用一个星期就爆炸了。合作社再赔他一个新的，他提心吊胆地使用着，也只二十多天就爆炸了。合作社再赔他一个新的热水瓶的时候，他已经没有勇气使用了，只好把它当作装饰品摆着。浙江省诸暨县税务局买了十三只热水瓶，接连爆炸了十二只，剩下的一只，大家都不敢使用了。这说明热水瓶爆炸在消费者中造成的恐惧是不轻的。
    消费者除了怕爆炸以外，还怕热水瓶不保暖。上面所说的几个工厂的一些竹壳热水瓶，有的只能保暖五、六小时，有的跟一般水壶一样，灌入的开水在一、二小时内就冷了。虽说，有的工厂允许掉换爆炸的和不保暖的热水瓶，但是因为手续太麻烦，有时还要排队等候，许多消费者都不敢轻易购买。有的人硬要经销的商店打保票以后才买。这一下，连商店的营业人员也害怕热水瓶来了。上海市曹杨新村合作社营业员刘根生说：“因为爆炸的和不保暖的现象严重，顾客就问我们能保证不爆炸吗？’‘能保证保暖吗？’这很使我们伤脑筋：说能吧，实际上又不能；说不能吧，又怕完不成销售任务！”
    为什么让大量爆炸的、不能保暖的热水瓶到市场上来，在消费者中制造恐惧气氛呢？根本的原因是：自从1953年冬天热水瓶脱销以来，许多工厂，特别是新建立的工厂粗制滥造。商业部门外行和检验不严是原因之一。瓶胆爆炸不爆炸，保暖不保暖，主要看配料好不好，厚薄均匀不均匀，重量够不够、操作得好不好。据中国百货公司上海采购站的一位同志说，他们对出厂的热水瓶，从来只看外表有没有“水路”、“水泡”、“银光”，这些对于爆炸、保暖毫无关系，消费者也不大注意。既然商业部门只看外表，又包销，有些工厂也就乐于把一些坏品、次品冒充好品出厂了。
    据说，我国出口的热水瓶质量较好。为什么呢？因为生产部门和商业部门，都把这个工作当作一个重大政治任务来完成。不只制造的时候特别注意产品质量，对成品的检验，工厂和商业部门还要反复检验成品。可见，消除人们对热水瓶的恐惧是完全可以做到的。制造热水瓶的工厂和商业部门检验热水瓶的同志们，赶快让人们消除对热水瓶的恐惧吧！（附图片）
