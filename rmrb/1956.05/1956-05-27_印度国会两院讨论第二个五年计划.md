Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 26th: Following the People's House, the Indian Parliament's Council of States began discussions on May 25th regarding the principles, goals, and development plans outlined in India's Second Five-Year Plan. The People's House began its discussions on May 23rd.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru spoke first in the Council of States discussion. He stated that the entire construction process will ensure that the state-owned sector becomes absolutely and relatively larger, thereby increasingly controlling and dominating the national economy. He also said that within the scope prescribed for the private sector, its development should be encouraged.

Nehru said that India must find resources for the Five-Year Plan through some means of thrift. This burden may be alleviated by foreign aid. He said that India would accept such assistance if it did not attach any conditions. However, the nation should generally rely on itself.

Nehru believed that at least three more Five-Year Plans are needed to establish a socialist-style society in India.

In his speech, Nehru also explained aspects of the Five-Year Plan regarding industrial construction, agricultural production, and national income.

During the discussion in the People's House, A.K. Gopalan, the leader of the Communist Party of India's parliamentary group, said that every patriotic Indian would welcome the goals of this plan. He pointed out that the two important problems facing India are poverty and unemployment, and it is necessary to eliminate current unemployment and prevent future unemployment. He said that the Second Five-Year Plan definitely represents some progress compared to the First Five-Year Plan, and it contains larger-scale proposals for economic and development activities.

He also criticized certain aspects of the plan. He said that the plan neglects the important aspect of establishing and developing basic and heavy industries as quickly as possible. He also criticized that the private sector "continues its dominant position in the Indian economy" in this plan. He also called for increased allocations for social services and education and health.

    印度国会两院讨论第二个五年计划
    新华社新德里26日电　印度国会联邦院继人民院之后，在五月二十五日开始就印度第二个五年计划所规定的原则、目标和发展计划进行讨论，人民院是从五月二十三日开始讨论的。
    印度总理尼赫鲁在联邦院的讨论中首先发言。他说，整个建设过程将是使国营部分绝对地和相对地变得越来越大，从而越来越多地控制和支配全国经济。他还说，在为私营部分规定的范围内，应该鼓励它的发展。
    尼赫鲁说，印度必须通过某种节约办法为五年计划找到资源。这种负担可能由于国外的帮助而有所减轻。他说，假使这种帮助不附加任何条件的话，印度将接受它。但是国家一般地应该依靠自己。
    尼赫鲁认为，最少还需要三个五年计划才能在印度建立社会主义式样的社会。
    尼赫鲁在发言中还就五年计划中关于工业建设、农业生产和国民收入等方面作了解释。
    在人民院进行讨论时，印度共产党议会党团领袖高普兰说，每个爱国的印度人都会欢迎这个计划的目标。他指出，印度面临的两个重要问题是贫困和失业，必须消灭目前的失业，并且也要防止将来的失业。他说，第二个五年计划肯定地比第一个五年计划有了某些进展，它含有较大规模的关于经济和发展活动的建议。
    他也批评了这个计划的某些方面。他说，这个计划忽视了尽快地建立和发展基本工业和重工业这个重要的方面。他还批评在这个计划中私营部分“继续它在印度经济中占优势地位”。他还要求增加对社会服务和教育卫生的拨款。
