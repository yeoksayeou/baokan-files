Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions

    A letter from the Linxi Mine Office of the Kailuan Coal Mine General Administration: The "Reader's Letters" page on April 16 criticized the waste of coal in our mine. We have decided to take some measures to improve our work: in terms of retreating mining, we will strengthen the work of picking gangue on the mining face and in the chutes; in terms of development and tunneling, we will strictly promote separate digging and transporting, and separate loading; we will install semi-coal and semi-rock gangue buckets at the Tianqiao coal picking site; and we will further study and improve the screening equipment.

    A letter from the Jixi Mining Bureau: The criticism of Didao Mine under our bureau on the "Reader's Letters" page on April 1st is correct. Didao Mine arbitrarily prolongs working hours, which not only affects the normal production order, but also harms the health of workers. We have decided to strengthen ground transportation and production management to balance the workload and correct the erroneous practice of prolonging workers' working hours.

    After the article "The Encounter of a Letter of Criticism" was published on the "Reader's Letters" page on February 19, the Political Department of the Ministry of Public Security and the People's Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Railways not only criticized the irresponsible attitude of relevant personnel in handling people's letters, but also investigated the situation reflected in the letter. According to the results of the investigation, it is necessary for the Railway Public Security Cadre School to build a large classroom, and it has been submitted for approval, so there is nothing wrong with it.

    A letter from the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics Committee of the Chinese Communist Party: The "Reader's Letters" page on February 14 exposed the incident of Fang Fumei, a staff member of our institute, beating her mother-in-law. Although Fang Fumei's mother-in-law was also responsible in this incident, Fang Fumei's behavior of beating the elderly is not allowed. Fang Fumei has now been given administrative punishment and expelled from the Communist Youth League.

    A letter from the Liaoning Farm Tool Factory: The People's Daily's criticism on April 9 of our factory's lack of enthusiasm in supporting workers' creativity is correct. We have examined our right-leaning conservative ideology in our work, and decided to establish and improve the responsibility system and contact system of the sections and offices to promote the stable production of each workshop.

    A letter from the Longguan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party: The People's Daily published a letter on March 18 criticizing our county for holding too many meetings, which affected spring plowing production. We accept the reader's opinion and have decided that in the future, county-level agencies should report to the county party committee for approval before convening meetings of district and township cadres, and should try to reduce the number of meetings and the number of participants; the documents issued by various departments to districts and townships should also be as brief as possible.
