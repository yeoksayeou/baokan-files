    Convenient Ticketing Methods for Passengers

    The Passenger Transport Team A of the Hohhot Railway Station has changed the old practice of selling tickets from inside a room and implemented mobile ticketing, greatly facilitating passengers. The ticket inspectors of this team go to the waiting room to take care of the elderly, children, pregnant women, and people with disabilities, and first issue each passenger a numbered ticket, then sell tickets in numerical order. Thirty minutes before selling tickets, the ticket sellers inquire about the passengers' destinations to avoid wasting time asking and explaining at the time of purchase. Service staff member Yan Ziliang prepares price lists for various stations in the waiting room and also helps passengers exchange for smaller bills. After implementing these methods, the phenomenon of passengers queuing to buy tickets disappeared, and passengers felt more convenient and sent letters to the newspaper praising the service attitude of Passenger Transport Team A.

    Now, the comrades of Team A are studying diagrams of passenger transfers, researching which train is suitable for passengers to transfer to at which location, in order to reduce passengers' difficulties during the journey. This method is worthy of learning and promotion by railway stations in various locations.

    便利旅客的售票法
    呼和浩特车站客运甲班，改变了坐在房子里买票的老规矩，实行流动售票，给旅客很大的方便。这个班的检票员到候车室里照顾老人、小孩、孕妇和有残疾的人，并且先发给每位旅客一个号码牌，再按号码顺序卖票。售票员在售票以前三十分钟就询问旅客的去向，避免买票时现问现解释耽误时间。服务员阎子良在候车室内准备了各站价目表，还帮助旅客换零钱。推行了这几种办法后，旅客买票排队的现象就没有了，旅客们都感到方便，纷纷给报社去信表扬客运甲班的服务态度。
    现在，甲班同志们正研究旅客换车示意图，研究旅客到什么地方换那一趟车合适，以减少旅客途中的困难。这种办法，值得各地车站学习推广。
