    At the Beijing Municipal Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, the first traditional Chinese medicine hospital being established in the capital, has already treated 1,178 patients in the fifteen days from May 3rd to 17th.

    Xu Bo, a 27-year-old patient suffering from "thromboangiitis obliterans," had been experiencing severe pain in his toes for six years, making it difficult to walk and impossible to sleep at night. On May 3rd, the day the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital began its outpatient service, he limped in for treatment. The traditional Chinese medicine doctor prescribed an internal "Huiyang Pain Relief Method" formula and an external Yin Sore Dissipating Ointment. The second time, the patient came to the hospital more easily. The third time he came to the hospital, the color of his toes and the surface of his feet had changed from dark purple to rosy, and he no longer felt pain. He said that he could sleep peacefully at night.

    The internal medicine, gynecology, pediatrics, acupuncture, orthopedics, hemorrhoid and fistula, and massage departments, which are simultaneously accepting outpatients here, all have examples of very effective treatments.

    Famous traditional Chinese medicine doctors Xiao Longyou, Qu Wenlou, Zhang Juren, and Zhao Bingnan are consultants here. Zong Weixin of the hospital's internal medicine department, Sa Renshan of the orthopedics department, Qi Zhenhua of the pediatrics department, and Liu Fengwu of the gynecology department are also well-known traditional Chinese medicine doctors in Beijing.

    The various departments of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital are currently only accepting outpatients in the morning, with the hemorrhoid and fistula department accepting inpatients. In the future, all departments will gradually accept inpatients. The hospital will officially open on July 1st, at which time it will have 235 beds and can accept 400 outpatients every morning and afternoon.

    在首都第一所中医医院里
    正在首都筹备建立的第一所中医医院——北京市中医医院，从五月三日到十七日十五天中已经为1，178个患者进行了治疗。
    患“栓塞性脉管炎”的徐波，年二十七岁，两足趾剧痛已经六年，行走不方便，夜间无法入睡。五月三日中医医院开始门诊这天，他一跛一跛地来治疗，中医大夫给开了内服的“回阳止痛法”的方子，并外用阴疽内消药膏。第二次，患者比较顺利地到医院来。第三次到医院时，他的足趾足面的颜色已经由暗紫变为红润，不疼痛了，他说夜间可以安眠了。
    这里同时接受门诊的内科、妇科、儿科、针灸科、正骨科、痔漏科和按摩科，都有治疗效果很好的例子。
    著名中医大夫萧龙友、瞿文楼、张菊人、赵炳南等是这里的顾问。医院内科的宗维新、骨科的萨仁山、小儿科的祁振华和妇科的刘奉五等，也都是北京市著名的中医大夫。
    中医医院各科现在仅在上午接受门诊患者，其中痔漏科接受住院患者。以后各科都将陆续接受住院患者。医院将在七月一日正式开幕，那时它将设有235张病床，每天上下午可以接受四百个门诊患者。
