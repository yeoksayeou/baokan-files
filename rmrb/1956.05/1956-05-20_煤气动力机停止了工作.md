To the Editor:

    On April 23rd, we arrived at the pumping station in Pingyang County, Zhejiang Province. Although it was the rice transplanting season when the fields urgently needed irrigation, the pumping station was not working.

    It turned out that the Pingyang County pumping station had a total of thirteen gas power engines, all produced by the Wuxi Power Machinery Factory (formerly Yixingsheng Factory). These machines only worked for seven or eight days before problems started to occur constantly. The pumping station had repeatedly requested the higher authorities to instruct the factory producing the pumps to send people for repairs, but without result. Therefore, the pumping station had to carry out the repairs themselves.

    Due to the poor quality of the machines, the pumping station was unable to complete its task of pumping water for irrigation for the agricultural cooperatives, and many farmers were very unhappy. Some farmers questioned: Why can such machines be allowed to leave the factory? The Wuxi Power Machinery Factory must be responsible to the people and solve this problem immediately. Liu Liangyuan

    煤气动力机停止了工作编辑同志：
    四月二十三日，我们来到浙江省平阳县抽水机站。虽然这时正是田里迫切需要灌溉的插秧季节，可是抽水机却不在进行工作。
    原来，平阳县抽水机站共有十三台煤气动力机，都是无锡动力机械厂（原义兴盛厂）出产的。这批机器只使用了七、八天，就不断地出问题，抽水机站曾经多次要求上级单位指示生产抽水机的工厂派人来检修，但是没有结果。因此，抽水机站只好自己进行修理工作了。
    由于机器质量坏，抽水机站为农业社抽水灌溉的任务完不成，许多农民很有意见。有的农民责问：这样的机器为什么能出厂？无锡动力机械厂要对人民负责，立即解决这个问题。　刘亮元
