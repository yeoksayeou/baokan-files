Hoxha said that during the period covered by the summary report, Albania has transformed from a backward agricultural country into an agricultural-industrial country due to the successful completion of the tasks of the First Five-Year Plan. The Albanian people have forged an unbreakable bond of close friendship with the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. The entire people and the Labor Party will forever be grateful for the assistance and support of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democracies, and will make good use of this assistance to enhance the well-being of the Albanian people and consolidate the camp of peace and socialism.

Speaking of foreign policy, Hoxha said: The foreign policy of our government is a policy of peace. Our country now maintains friendly diplomatic relations with eighteen countries in Europe, the Near East, and Asia. Our relations with the fraternal Yugoslav people are being strengthened daily in a spirit of mutual understanding and friendship. We will develop and expand ties with the people of all countries, if they also have this desire.

Hoxha then spoke about the completion of the First Five-Year Plan. He said that the main economic tasks of the First Five-Year Plan have been basically completed. The proportion of industrial production in the country's overall production has increased from 9.8% in 1938 to 43.5% in 1955. The value of industrial output in 1955 was approximately 2.8 times the level of 1950, and 10.5 times the pre-war level. In 1955, coal mining increased fivefold compared to 1950, electricity fivefold, metal processing fivefold, timber processing threefold, and light industry nearly sevenfold.

In 1955, grain production increased by 53% compared to 1950, cotton by 77%, and tobacco by more than 4.3 times. The number of livestock has greatly exceeded the pre-war level.

The reporter then said that collectivization is the only way to rid agriculture of its backwardness. As of May 15th, there are 694 agricultural production cooperatives nationwide, of which 376 were established this year. Agricultural production cooperatives unite 29,478 farm households, whose cultivated land accounts for more than 26% of all cultivated land in the country.

Speaking about the material and cultural life of the people, he said that in 1955, compared to 1950, the turnover of socialist components in trade increased by 80%. During the First Five-Year Plan, the national income nearly increased by 70%. Illiteracy among people under the age of forty has been completely eliminated domestically, and the number of students nationwide has increased to 3.3 times that of 1938.

In the part about the Party, Hoxha said that as of April 1, 1956, the Albanian Labor Party has a total of 41,372 members and 7,272 candidate members.

The reporter said that in strengthening the organization and ideological training of party members, our tasks are: to strengthen the life of the Party and make it more active, to strictly observe the Leninist norms of inner-party life, to improve the composition of the Party, to strengthen inner-party democracy, to wage a merciless struggle against any attempt to use inner-party democracy to harm the Party, to consolidate the Party's leading role in national life, and to strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses.
