Xinhua News Agency, May 9th - Deep Internal Divisions Within the North Atlantic Group: The United States Faces Opposition in Many Places

　　Dulles Admits to Major Internal Disagreements in the West

　　Xinhua News Agency, May 9th - U.S. Secretary of State Dulles delivered a speech at a gathering of the Jewish Freemasons in Washington on May 8th, reviewing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Council meeting held last week, and emphasized the need to "eliminate" the "disunity" within the group.

　　Dulles advocated giving NATO greater political "depth" so that it could "normally and regularly" discuss issues affecting the Atlantic Group. Dulles admitted that the "major weakness of the West" is "its disunity." He believed that "the organization of the North Atlantic Group is unsound" because member states have never engaged in "extensive consultations" on issues that "shake the foundations of the Atlantic Group." In this regard, he cited the divisions among Western countries on the Middle East issue, the North African issue, and the Cyprus issue.

　　In discussing the strengthening of the Atlantic Group from a political standpoint, Dulles made it clear that his envisioned goal was to establish within this fifteen-nation group a kind of political control similar to how the United States, through the Organization of American States, controls the internal affairs of Latin American countries. Dulles boasted that the Organization of American States can handle some "special situations" between member states, such as overthrowing the legitimate government of Guatemala and establishing American puppet rule. He believed that the "experience" gained by the Organization of American States could serve as a model for the Atlantic Group.

　　Dulles's speech confirmed the new American plan, revealed by the Western press, to strengthen the "political cooperation" of the Atlantic Group. An Associated Press dispatch from Paris on May 6th stated that Dulles proposed at the NATO Council meeting the establishment of a high-level "Atlantic Cabinet," with the participation of the United States, as a "Cold War General Staff" to formulate "common policies" among member states to deal with the Soviet Union, and to "resolve internal disputes and promote unity in the Western world."

　　Some French, British, and American Newspapers Believe a Gulf of Misunderstanding Has Emerged

　　Xinhua News Agency, May 9th - Several French, British, and American newspapers, in discussing the recently concluded NATO Council meeting, have emphasized the deep divisions among the member states of the group.

　　Paris's "Le Monde" said: "Much was said about the need to reform the Atlantic organization and strengthen the unity of its members, but few practical decisions were made: this is the result of the NATO Ministerial Council meeting." The newspaper also pointed out that within the group, "a gulf of misunderstanding has emerged between the Turkish minister and the Portuguese minister on the one hand, and the French minister and the ministers of the Scandinavian countries on the other, and extremely sharp disputes will inevitably arise in future debates on Soviet policy."

　　The London "Times" correspondent in Paris quoted a "senior official" of NATO as saying: "Major differences emerged during the meeting, and we are still far from coordinating our policies."

　　Karenlander, the Paris correspondent of the American "New York Times," commenting on a passage in Dulles's speech at the meeting regarding the American attitude towards China, said: "One of the biggest policy differences among the allies is on the Far East issue, where the United States has adopted an attitude that is not endorsed by any of its allies. Dulles reiterated this attitude at the NATO Council meeting, but his remarks were met with significant silence."

　　U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Investigation Report Admits

　　Anti-American Sentiment is Rising in Asia and the Near East

　　Xinhua News Agency, May 9th - Washington News: A report released on May 5th by the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee stated: "In many countries, people have deep doubts about the motives and goals of the United States."

　　This report was submitted by a special mission led by Congressman Zablocki after visiting many countries in Asia, the Near East, and Europe. From the report, it can be seen that they gained the impression from Asian and Near Eastern countries that these countries are increasingly dissatisfied with the U.S.'s "position of strength" policy, anti-American sentiment is rising, and the economic situation of those countries that have concluded military treaties with the U.S. is very serious.

　　The report, in discussing India, said that "India has a great influence in Southeast Asia." The report expressed clear dissatisfaction with India's implementation of an independent policy. The report said that the "scope of misunderstandings" between India and the United States is widening, especially on international issues.

　　In discussing the visit to Japan, the report pointed out that in Japan there exists "the inevitable dissatisfaction caused by the presence of a large number of foreign troops."

　　The report, in discussing the situation in Pakistan, said that despite the serious economic situation in Pakistan, military appropriations in the U.S.'s "aid" program for Pakistan are increasing year by year, while appropriations for "technical cooperation" are constantly decreasing, which makes "Pakistan's economic difficulties increasingly serious."

　　The report stated that there is a trend of inflation in Greece, and that even a slight tension could undermine the country's economy. The report admitted that the sentiment of the Greek people demanding that money not be used for military purposes is growing stronger. The report also mentioned Turkey's economic difficulties, saying that since 1945, approximately 40% of Turkey's budget has been used for military purposes. The report believes that this amount "exceeds the limits that the country's economy can bear."

　　The report concluded that the special mission "found in many countries that people have deep doubts about the motives and goals of the United States," and that on the other hand, the Soviet Union's policies are having a "great influence" on the people in the regions they visited. The Soviet Union's proposals for "friendly cooperation and economic assistance are very attractive."

　　The report advocated re-examining American policies. However, the report opposed the United States taking any steps to ease international tensions.

　　Philippine Congressman Tolentino

　　Opposes the Subordinate Relationship Between the Philippines and the United States

　　Xinhua News Agency, May 8th - Manila News: Philippine Congressman Tolentino said that recent circumstances have shown that it is necessary to re-examine some of the current agreements between the Philippines and the United States and the relationship with the United States.

　　According to the "Manila Chronicle" on May 4th, Tolentino said at a meeting of the Manila Rotary Club on May 3rd that taking action to re-study Philippine-American relations is a good sign, demonstrating our "spiritual awakening to the status of a free nation and an increasingly strong opposition to accepting a subordinate relationship, an opposition to the tendency to willingly submit."

　　Tolentino said that after the Philippines gained independence, it concluded various agreements with the United States, which were conducted when the Philippines was unable to insist on "conditions that are in line with our status as a sovereign nation."

　　He said that the most in need of modification is the Quirino-Foster Agreement, according to which various funds are allocated to be "used for plans aimed at keeping the country permanently agricultural."

　　The "Manila Chronicle" published an editorial on May 5th supporting Congressman Tolentino's proposal to revise the agreements between the United States and the Philippines. The editorial said: "It is precisely because of these agreements that there are so-called advisers here. It is becoming increasingly clear that the main purpose of these advisers is to promote American interests in the Philippines. As long as these agreements remain in effect, our interests will always be subordinate to American interests."

　　The newspaper called on the leaders of the Philippines to declare that the sole purpose of their desire to amend Philippine-American relations is to affirm Philippine sovereignty, not to increase the supply of American aid.

### 北大西洋集团内部分歧深刻  美国在许多地方都受到反对

　　北大西洋集团内部分歧深刻
    美国在许多地方都受到反对
    杜勒斯承认西方内部分歧大
    新华社9日讯  美国国务卿杜勒斯五月八日在华盛顿犹太共济会的集会上发表演说，对上星期举行的北大西洋集团理事会会议作了回顾，并且强调指出应当“消除”这个集团的“不团结”。
    杜勒斯主张给北大西洋公约组织以更大的政治上的“深度”，使它能够“正常地和经常地”讨论影响大西洋集团的问题。杜勒斯承认，“西方的重大弱点”就是“它的不团结”。他认为“北大西洋集团的组织是不健全的”，因为成员国之间从来没有在一些“动摇大西洋集团基础的问题”上“进行广泛磋商”。在这方面，他举出了西方国家在中东问题、北非问题、塞浦路斯问题上的分歧。
    杜勒斯在谈到从政治方面加强大西洋集团的时候表明，他所设想的目标，是要在这个十五国的集团中建立同美国通过拉丁美洲国家组织控制拉丁美洲国家内政那样的一种政治控制。杜勒斯夸耀美洲国家组织能够处理成员国之间的一些“特殊局势”，类如推翻危地马拉的合法政权、建立美国的傀儡统治等等。他认为，美洲国家组织所取得的“经验”可以作为大西洋集团的借镜。
    杜勒斯的演说证实了西方报界所透露的美国加强大西洋集团“政治合作”的新计划。美联社五月六日巴黎消息说，杜勒斯在北大西洋集团理事会会议上建议成立由美国参加的高级的“大西洋内阁”，作为一个“冷战参谋部”，来拟订成员国之间对付苏联的“共同政策”，并且“解决西方世界内部的纠纷和促进团结”。
    法英美一些报纸认为一道不谅解的鸿沟产生了
    新华社9日讯  法国、英国和美国的一些报纸在谈到最近闭幕的北大西洋集团理事会会议的时候，都着重指出这个集团的成员国之间的深刻分歧。
    巴黎“世界报”说：“谈了很多关于必须改革大西洋组织和加强它的成员国的团结的话，可是很少做出实际决定：这就是北大西洋公约组织部长理事会会议的结果。”这家报纸还指出，在这个集团内部，“以土耳其部长和葡萄牙部长为一方，以法国部长和斯堪的纳维亚国家的部长为另一方，彼此之间产生了一道不谅解的鸿沟，对苏联政策的各种辩论今后不可避免地将产生极其尖锐的争吵”。
    伦敦“泰晤士报”驻巴黎记者引证北大西洋集团的一个“高级官员”的话说：“在会议期间出现了很大分歧，我们现在还远不能使我们的政策协调起来。”
    美国“纽约时报”驻巴黎记者卡伦德就杜勒斯在会议上谈到美国对中国的态度的一段话发表评论说：“盟国之间在政策上最大的分歧之一是在远东问题上，美国在这个问题上采取了一种得不到它的任何盟国赞同的态度。杜勒斯在北大西洋公约组织理事会会议上重申这种态度，但是他的发言受到意味深长的沉默的对待。”
    美众议院外委会调查报告承认
    亚洲近东反美情绪日益高涨
    新华社9日讯  华盛顿消息：美国众议院外交委员会五月五日发表的一个调查报告里说：“在许多国家里发现人们对美国的动机和目标抱有深刻的怀疑。”
    这个报告是众议员扎布洛基率领的一个特别使团在访问了亚洲、近东和欧洲的许多国家以后提出的。从报告里可以看到，他们从亚洲和近东国家得到这样的印象：这些国家日益不满美国的“实力地位”政策，反美情绪越来越高涨，同美国缔结军事条约的那些国家的经济状况很严重。
    报告在谈到印度的时候说，“印度在东南亚的影响很大”。报告对印度执行独立政策表示了明显的不满。报告说，印度和美国之间的“误解的范围”正在扩大，特别是在国际问题上。
    报告在谈到对日本的访问的时候指出，在日本存在着“由于驻扎着大量的外国军队必然引起的不满情绪”。
    报告谈到巴基斯坦情况的时候说，尽管巴基斯坦的经济情况很严重，可是在美国对巴基斯坦的“援助”计划中，军事拨款还是年年增加，而“技术合作”的拨款却在不断减少，这就使得“巴基斯坦的经济困难程度越来越大”。
    报告谈到，在希腊存在着通货膨胀的趋势，那怕是一点稍微紧张的局势都可能破坏这个国家的经济。报告承认希腊人民要求不要把金钱用于军事目的的情绪越来越强烈。报告还谈到土耳其的经济困难，它说，从1945年起，土耳其的预算大约有40％用于军事目的。报告认为，这个数目“超过了这个国家的经济所能够负担的限度”。
    报告最后说，这个特别使团“在许多国家里发现人们对美国的动机和目标抱有深刻的怀疑”，另一方面，苏联的政策对他们这次所访问的地区的人民产生着“很大的影响”。苏联关于“友好合作和经济援助的建议是非常吸引人的”。
    报告主张重新研究美国的政策。但是，报告反对美国在缓和国际紧张局势方面采取任何步骤。
    菲律宾众议员托伦蒂诺
    反对美菲之间的附属关系
    新华社8日讯  马尼拉消息：菲律宾众议员托伦蒂诺说，最近的情况已经显示：有必要重新审查菲律宾和美国之间的一些现行协定和同美国之间的关系。
    据“马尼拉纪事报”五月四日刊载，托伦蒂诺五月三日在马尼拉扶轮社的一次集会上说，采取重新研究菲美关系的行动是一个良好的表现，它表现着我们“意识到作为一个自由国家的地位的精神上的觉醒和日益强烈地反对接受附属关系、反对甘愿服从的倾向”。
    托伦蒂诺说，菲律宾在获得独立以后同美国缔结了各式各样的协定，那是在菲律宾无法坚持“符合于我们作为一个主权国家的地位的条件”的时候进行的。
    他说，最需要加以修改的是季里诺—福斯特协定，根据这个协定所拨付的各种款项都被“用在目的在于使这个国家永远保持农业经济的那些计划上”。
    “马尼拉纪事报”五月五日发表社论，支持众议员托伦蒂诺要求修改美国和菲律宾之间的协定的主张。社论说：“正是由于这些协定，这里才有了所谓顾问。日益明显，这些顾问的主要目的是促进美国在菲律宾的利益。只要这些协定一天仍然生效，我们的利益便始终从属于美国的利益。”
    报纸要求菲律宾的领袖们宣布，他们希望修正菲美关系的唯一目的是肯定菲律宾的主权，而不是增加美援的供应。
