    The Ordeal of a Scientific Research Achievement
    By our reporter, Xi Ping
    The importance of scientific research to national construction is understood by many. Our country's current level of science and technology is still very low, and we need to cherish any beneficial contributions from scientific workers. This is also easy to understand. However, the following incident occurred: In Shanghai, a doctor named Guo Xingsun manufactured pure argon gas, a rare industrial gas that had previously been reliant on imports. He wanted to offer it to the country for use in industrial production; however, relevant agencies and factories showed an incomprehensibly extreme indifference to this, subjecting Guo Xingsun to many unreasonable setbacks. After four years, the matter is still not satisfactorily resolved.
    Guo Xingsun is a doctor at the Shanghai Film Studio. He researched nitrous oxide for anesthesia purposes in 1951, driven by his work needs. From researching nitrous oxide, he progressed to researching argon gas, and successfully researched and manufactured it on March 26, 1952. Argon gas is an indispensable raw material for manufacturing neon lights, fluorescent lamps, and vacuum tubes. Our country had never manufactured it before. Guo Xingsun's ability to manufacture argon gas was undoubtedly a contribution to the country. On the fourth day after successfully manufacturing argon gas, Guo Xingsun informed the then East China Industrial Department's Chemical Industry Division of this news, hoping that the Chemical Industry Division would support his work. He then sent a written report to the Chemical Industry Division. However, the staff of the East China Industrial Department's Chemical Industry Division did not show any enthusiasm for Guo Xingsun's beneficial and creative scientific research work. Twenty days passed before Lu Huanzhang, a staff member of the Chemical Industry Division, met with Guo Xingsun. Guo put forward two suggestions at the time: First, he hoped that the Chemical Industry Division would send someone to the laboratory to see if they could help him expand his research work from the laboratory to production; second, he hoped that the Chemical Industry Division would find a way to stop certain departments from treating magnesium alloy, one of the raw materials for extracting argon gas, as waste. The state agency worker simply replied to Guo Xingsun's legitimate request with one sentence: "Please wait another week, and another unit will ask you to talk." The conversation ended there. Guo Xingsun waited and waited. But, one year, two years passed, and until now, Guo Xingsun has never seen anyone introduced by the Chemical Industry Division. This was the first setback Guo Xingsun encountered.
    Guo Xingsun was not discouraged by this. He continued his research work in his small room and paid attention to opportunities to contribute his research results at any time. On May 15, 1952, Guo Xingsun happened to see in the newspaper that three comrades from the state-owned Nanjing Bulb Factory had successfully trial-produced fluorescent powder, another important raw material for fluorescent lamps. He immediately thought that the argon gas he manufactured was also suitable for fluorescent lamps. In this way, our country could manufacture completely domestically-produced fluorescent lamps. He quickly wrote to the Nanjing Bulb Factory and then sent several bottles of samples. A month passed, two months passed, and it wasn't until the fifth month, January 23, 1953, that he finally received a brief official letter from the Nanjing Bulb Factory, which stated: "Your letter of August 18, 1952, has been received with respect. The two bottles of argon gas you sent have also been received. Due to the factory's busy production schedule, we have not had time to test them for several months. We apologize for this. We hope you will understand." This cold official letter poured another bucket of cold water over Guo Xingsun, who was waiting for good news all day long.
    Just when Guo Xingsun was running into walls everywhere, someone took the initiative to come to his door. He was Da Shixiong, an engineer from the Shanghai privately-owned Liming Electric Appliance Factory. In the sixth volume, fifth issue of the "Electricity World" magazine published in 1952, he saw an article by Wu Zukai, the director of the Nanjing Bulb Factory, introducing the factory's trial production of fluorescent powder, which mentioned that Guo Xingsun had manufactured argon gas himself. It should be admitted that this engineer from a private enterprise was much more sensible than the bureaucrats in the state agencies mentioned earlier. He knew that argon gas was a very useful thing, so he hurried to find Guo Xingsun, asked him what difficulties he had, and expressed his willingness to help him. The engineer said to Guo Xingsun: "Even if the cost of manufacturing argon gas now is more expensive than imported goods, we should still do it ourselves, so that we can have argon gas made in our own country." When he learned that the Nanjing Bulb Factory had delayed the fluorescent lamp test for several months, he immediately took the argon gas trial-produced by Guo Xingsun to his factory for testing. The first test failed, so they did a second test. In less than two months, the test was successful. On December 22, Da Shixiong excitedly informed him: The test results showed that the argon gas made by Guo Xingsun was completely suitable for fluorescent lamps. The light color was not worse than imported goods, and the cost was much cheaper than imported goods.
    However, Guo Xingsun still eagerly hoped to contribute his research results to the country. On the 25th, he first told the Nanjing Bulb Factory about this news, but there was still no response. This incident aroused the indignation of Guo Xingsun's friends and relatives. At that time, a member of the Communist Youth League (Guo Xingsun's relative) wrote a letter to the Liberation Daily, which was forwarded to the Shanghai branch of the Electrical Industry Administration Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building. On the evening of March 3, 1953, a comrade surnamed Shen from the First Ministry of Machine Building came to investigate. A day later, he and Wu Zukai, the director of the Nanjing Bulb Factory, visited Guo Xingsun's laboratory. The factory director believed that the argon gas manufactured by Guo Xingsun was indeed usable and promised to send an agreement as soon as he arrived in Nanjing. But after they left, things remained the same and continued to drag on for another eight months. The Nanjing Bulb Factory's Technology Section finally sent a brief letter, saying that the argon gas manufactured by Guo Xingsun "can be applied to the manufacture of fluorescent lamps," but there was nothing more.
    Guo Xingsun, having nowhere else to turn, had to go to the East China Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building in Shanghai at that time. At the office, he met Wu Zukai, the director of the Nanjing Bulb Factory, again. Wu Zukai said to Guo Xingsun: Although the argon gas manufactured by Guo Xingsun was no different from imported goods, the imported goods had been identified by scientific instruments with a prism, while the argon gas manufactured by Guo Xingsun had not yet been identified by a prism. He could not take this responsibility. They wanted Guo Xingsun to have the argon gas identified. Guo Xingsun had no choice but to go to the Physics Department of Shanghai Jiao Tong University and find Professor Zhao Xiuhong, asking Zhao to help him identify it with a prism. Professor Zhao Xiuhong told him: Since it has been proven in practice that argon gas can be used, there is no need to find an expensive prism for identification, because practice itself is the best identification.
    While Guo Xingsun was being treated coldly by all parties, Da Shixiong, the engineer of the private factory, repeatedly negotiated with Guo Xingsun, asking to cooperate with him, and even asked Guo Xingsun to use this argon gas manufacturing technology as a shareholder in his enterprise, or to buy this technology at a high price. Guo Xingsun refused both conditions. Later, Da Shixiong asked people to negotiate with Guo Xingsun again and again, and bought several bottles of argon gas from Guo Xingsun for a total of 4,000 yuan.
    On the afternoon of February 12, 1954 (nearly two years had passed), the director of the Nanjing Bulb Factory appeared at Guo Xingsun's residence, coming to Guo Xingsun for the argon gas matter. It turned out that it was difficult to import pure argon gas at that time, and the demand for production increased. The factory director asked Guo Xingsun to hand over the argon gas production technology to them, saying that the identification matter could be resolved soon. To hand over all argon gas manufacturing technology to the country was Guo Xingsun's wish, and he had no objection to this. However, Guo Xingsun raised two points regarding handing over all the technology (including all equipment) to the Nanjing Bulb Factory: First, the argon gas manufacturing equipment has been continuously researched and expanded by him, and it can now produce 2,000 bottles of argon gas per year, while the Nanjing Bulb Factory only needs hundreds of bottles of argon gas per year. If all the equipment is transferred to the Nanjing Bulb Factory, on the one hand, the equipment utilization rate will be too low, and on the other hand, the argon gas needed in the market will still have to be imported. Second, Guo Xingsun discovered some important new problems and some by-products in the process of researching argon gas, and Guo Xingsun is interested in continuing the research. Based on the above two reasons, Guo Xingsun suggested that the equipment for manufacturing argon gas should not be received by the Nanjing Bulb Factory, but should be comprehensively considered by the East China Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building. Guo Xingsun's opinion was worthy of consideration, but the East China Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building did not adopt his opinion. As a result, the Nanjing Bulb Factory paid 2,035 yuan in cost and purchased all of Guo Xingsun's argon gas manufacturing equipment and transported it to Nanjing. Guo Xingsun helped the factory install the machines and taught the technology to the workers. Guo Xingsun wrote a detailed report on the "Process of Self-Made Pure Argon Gas" to the First Ministry of Machine Building (the Nanjing Bulb Factory also had a copy of this report). In the report, he described in detail the process of trial-producing argon gas and his opinions, and requested relevant parties to continue to study the new problems he discovered in the process of manufacturing argon gas. At the end of the report, he wrote: "Now our motherland has stood up and will no longer be oppressed and discriminated against; however, only by building the country well in terms of industry can we ensure that our children and grandchildren will never be oppressed and discriminated against. In this great cause, whether you do a certain job or I do it, we must do it well. I hope they will keep in touch with me so that I can know the development of this 'child' (referring to his research results). At the same time, if I am needed, I am willing to assist."
    Should things end here? Who knows that this unfortunate encounter with a scientific innovation has not ended here.
    The argon gas trial-produced by Guo Xingsun in his small room was bought by private factories such as Liming Electric Appliance Factory and other factories, and more than 100 bottles were made into more than 20,000 fluorescent lamps, which were sold to consumers by the Shanghai State-owned Transportation and Telecommunications Equipment Company. Users generally expressed satisfaction with these fluorescent lamps, and there have been no returns in more than a year. Guo Xingsun also installed a fluorescent lamp made with his self-made argon gas in his own home, and the light color has always been very good. However, after the argon gas manufacturing equipment was installed in the Nanjing Bulb Factory, problems occurred. Last year, they simply put the equipment aside and continued to apply to purchase argon gas from abroad. Until now, they are still using imported argon gas. What disappointed Guo Xingsun the most was that the Nanjing Bulb Factory never notified him of these problems, allowing him to continue to participate in this research work.
    So far, this is the situation.
    Argon gas is not the most important product in industrial construction, and the problem of manufacturing argon gas is no longer a secret in modern chemical industry. But it is something new in our country. We must welcome and support new things with great enthusiasm, even if it is not something remarkable.
    Let us pay more attention to and support the creative scientific activities of the people that are beneficial to national construction!

    一件科学研究成果的遭遇
    本报记者　习平
    科学研究工作对国家建设的重要性是许多人都知道的，我国目前科学技术水平还很低，需要珍视科学工作人员的任何一点有益的贡献，这也是容易理解的。但是却发生了这样一件事情：在上海，一个名叫郭星孙的医生，制造了一种过去一向依靠国外进口的、工业用的稀有气体纯氩气，他要把它送给国家，以便应用到工业生产中去；而有关的机关和工厂却对此表现了无法理解的极端的冷淡，使郭星孙遭受了许多毫无道理的挫折，前后经过了四年之久，依然没有得到圆满的解决。
    郭星孙是上海电影制片厂的医生。他为了工作上的需要，在1951年研究麻醉用的笑气。从研究笑气发展到研究氩气，并且在1952年3月26日研究成功。氩气是制造霓虹灯、日光灯、真空管不可缺少的原材料，我国还从未制造过。过去我国各工业部门应用的氩气是从国外进口的。郭星孙能够制造出氩气，无疑对国家是一个贡献。在氩气制造成功的第四天，郭星孙就把这个消息告诉当时的华东工业部化工处，希望化工处支持他的工作。接着又给化工处寄去了一份书面报告。但是华东工业部化工处的工作人员对郭星孙这种有益于国家的创造性的科学研究工作，并没有表现任何一点热情。一直过了二十天，化工处才由工作人员卢焕章接见了郭星孙。郭当时提出两点建议：一是希望化工处派人到实验室去看一看，能够帮助他把研究工作由实验室扩大到生产中去；二是希望化工处设法制止某些部门把提炼氩气的原料之一——合金镁当作废料处理的作法。这位国家机关工作人员对郭星孙的正当要求简单地答复了一句话：“请你再等一个星期，将会有另一单位请你谈话。”这场谈话就此结束。郭星孙一直等着。但是，过了一年，两年，直到现在为止，郭星孙始终没有见到化工处介绍什么人来。这是郭星孙碰到的第一个遭遇。
    郭星孙并没有因此而泄气，他继续在他的小亭子间里进行着研究工作，并随时注意着可以贡献他的研究成果的机会。1952年5月15日，郭星孙偶然看到报纸上刊登了国营南京灯泡厂有三个同志试制日光灯中另一种重要原料莹光粉成功的消息，他马上就联想到自己制造的氩气也适用于日光灯。这样，我国就可以制造完全国产的日光灯了。他很快给南京灯泡厂去信，接着寄去了好几瓶样品。一个月过去了，两个月过去了，一直等到第五个月，即1953年1月23日，好容易才接到南京灯泡厂一封寥寥数语的公函，函中说：“1952年8月18日大函敬悉。承寄氩气两瓶，亦经收到。本厂以生产任务繁忙，迄今数月尚无暇试验，至为歉仄。尚祈查察见谅。”这封冷冰冰的公函，给了整日守候着好消息的郭星孙，又兜头泼了一盆冷水。
    正当郭星孙到处碰壁的时候，有一个人自动找上门来了，他是上海私营丽明电器厂的工程师达士雄。他在1952年出版的第六卷第五期“电世界”杂志上，看到南京灯泡厂厂长吴祖垲介绍该厂试制莹光粉经过的一篇文章中，提到了郭星孙曾经自己制造氩气这件事。应当承认，这位私营企业的工程师比前面所说的那些国家机关的官僚主义者懂事得多。他知道氩气是一种很有用的东西，于是他就急忙赶来找郭星孙，并且询问他有什么困难，表示愿意帮助他。这位工程师对郭星孙说：“就是现在制造氩气的成本比进口货贵，我们也应当自己动手来制造，让我们有本国造的氩气。”当他了解到南京灯泡厂拖延了几个月没有给郭星孙做日光灯试验的时候，就马上拿了郭星孙试制出来的氩气到他的工厂去试验。第一次试验失败了，又搞第二次。前后不到两个月，试验就成功了。十二月二十二日，达士雄兴奋地通知他：试验结果，郭星孙自制的氩气完全适合于日光灯用，光色一点不比进口货差，而成本要比进口货便宜很多。
    但是郭星孙依然热望能把自己的这点研究成果贡献给国家。二十五日，他首先就把这个消息告诉给南京灯泡厂，还是没有回音。这件事，引起了郭星孙周围的亲友们的愤慨。当时一个青年团员（郭星孙的亲戚）给解放日报写了一封信，这封信被转到了第一机械工业部电器工业管理局上海的派出机关。1953年3月3日晚上，第一机械工业部一个姓沈的同志前来调查了。隔了一天，他又和南京灯泡厂厂长来参观了郭星孙的实验室。厂长认为郭星孙制造的氩气确实是可以用的，答应一到南京就寄协议书来。但是他们走了以后，事情依然如故，又继续拖了八个月之久，南京灯泡厂技术科才来了一封寥寥数语的信，说郭星孙制造的氩气“已能适用于莹光灯之制造”，却没有下文。
    郭星孙走投无路，只好自己去找当时在上海的第一机械工业部华东办事处。在办事处里他又遇到了南京灯泡厂厂长吴祖垲，吴祖垲对郭星孙说：尽管郭星孙制造的氩气和进口货没有两样，但是进口货经过科学仪器三棱镜的鉴定，郭星孙制造的还没有经过三棱镜的鉴定。他负不了这个责任。他们要郭星孙把氩气做一番鉴定。郭星孙无法，便去上海交通大学物理系，找赵修鸿教授，要赵帮助他用三棱镜鉴定。赵修鸿教授告诉他：既然事实上已证明氩气可以用，就不一定再找贵重的三棱镜作鉴定，因为实践本身就是最好的鉴定。
    在郭星孙遭到各方面的冷淡的时候，那位私营工厂的工程师达士雄又一再和郭星孙交涉，要求和他合作，甚至要求郭星孙以这种制造氩气的技术，作为股东投到他的企业里去，或者以高额代价收买这种技术。两个条件郭星孙都拒绝了。后来达士雄又请人再三向郭星孙洽商，先后共以四千元人民币向郭星孙购买氩气若干瓶。
    1954年2月12日下午（时间已过去将近两年了），在郭星孙的寓所里出现了南京灯泡厂厂长，他是为了氩气的事来找郭星孙的。原来那时纯氩气进口困难，而生产上的需要量增加，厂长要求郭星孙把生产氩气的技术交给他们，并说鉴定的事情不久也可以得到解决了。把氩气制造技术全部交给国家，这是郭星孙的愿望，对于这一点他没有任何意见，但是要把全部技术（包括全部设备）交给南京灯泡厂，郭星孙提出了两点意见：第一，现在制造氩气的设备，经过他的不断研究扩大，已经可以年产二千瓶氩气，而南京灯泡厂每年只需要氩气几百瓶，如果将全部设备移交给南京灯泡厂，一方面是设备利用率太低，另方面是市场上需要的氩气还得进口。第二，郭星孙在研究氩气过程中，发现了一些重要的新问题，和一些副产品，郭星孙有兴趣继续研究。根据上述两个理由，郭星孙建议制造氩气的设备不应由南京灯泡厂接收，而要第一机械工业部华东办事处作全面的考虑。郭星孙的意见是值得考虑的，但是，第一机械工业部华东办事处没有采纳他的意见。结果南京灯泡厂就出了2，035元人民币的成本费，将郭星孙制造氩气的全部设备收购下来，并且运往南京。郭星孙帮助工厂把机器安装好，并把技术传授给工人。郭星孙给第一机械工业部写了一份“自制纯氩气经过”的详细报告（这份报告南京灯泡厂也有一份副本），报告中他详尽地叙述了试制氩气的过程和他的见解，并且要求有关方面继续研究他在制造氩气过程中发现的新问题。在报告的最后，他写道：“现在我们的祖国已经站起来了，不会再受人家的压迫与歧视；但是只有在工业方面把国家建设好，才能保证我们的子孙永远不受压迫与歧视。在这伟大的事业中，对某一项要做的工作，你来做也好，我来做也好，但是我们一定要把它做好。我希望他们与我经常保持联系，使我知道这‘小孩子’（指他的研究成果）发展的情况，同时若有用到我的地方，我愿意协助。”
    事情到这里应该结束了吧？谁知这件科学创举的不幸遭遇到这里还没有结束。
    郭星孙在亭子间里试制的氩气，曾由私营丽明电器厂等厂买去了一百多瓶，制成了二万多根日光灯，由上海国营交通电讯器材公司卖给了消费者，用户对这些日光灯一般都表示满意，一年多来没有发现退货情形。郭星孙在自己家里，也装了一根用他自制的氩气制成的日光灯，光色始终很好。但制造氩气的设备在南京灯泡厂安装后，却发生了问题，去年就干脆把这套设备搁置了起来，继续申请向国外购买氩气，直到现在，他们还是使用进口货氩气。而最使郭星孙失望的是，南京灯泡厂始终没有把这些问题通知他，让他能继续来参加这个研究工作。
    这件事情，到目前为止，情况就是这样。
    氩气并不是工业建设中最重要的产品，制造氩气的问题在近代化学工业中也已经不是一个秘密。但是它在我国却是一件新的东西。我们必须以极大的热情欢迎、支持新生的事物，那怕它并不是什么了不起的东西。
    让我们更多地来关怀和支持人民群众各种有益于国家建设的、创造性的科学活动吧！
