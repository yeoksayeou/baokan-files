A Letter to the Women of Asia and Africa

Dear Sisters,

The Council of the Women’s International Democratic Federation, which unites millions of women, meeting in Beijing from April 24 to 30, 1956, extends its warmest greetings to you, women who are bravely fighting against poverty and ignorance, and who are actively striving for a better life for yourselves and your children. You play a significant role in the struggle and aspirations of your people to liberate themselves from colonial rule; you know very well that this colonial rule is the main cause of your suffering.

With your active participation, the people of many countries have gained freedom from colonial domination. These victories encourage our sisters in other parts of Asia and Africa who have not yet gained freedom to play a greater role in the struggle for their own liberation. We salute all the heroic sisters who participate in their people's struggle for national independence and sovereignty. We salute all the sisters who are standing up with greater enthusiasm to demand an end to colonial rule.

The people of Asian and African countries who have broken the shackles of colonial rule are taking responsibility to defend their newly won independence, making full use of their national resources and developing their culture. Women all over the world unanimously desire better living conditions for the people, full rights for women, and happiness for children.

Colonial countries, having suffered serious defeats in Asia and Africa, are adopting new methods to endanger freedom. For this purpose, they are provoking racial and religious prejudices; driving people from their homes; continuing war preparations; strengthening aggressive military treaties; establishing military bases; providing so-called economic assistance with attached political, economic and military conditions; and conducting terrible nuclear weapons tests.

All this threatens the recently achieved degree of relaxation of international tensions.

Only in a peaceful world can the common aspirations of all women be realized. We women all over the world oppose all aggressive treaties. The fact that women have taken action against the Baghdad and Southeast Asia Treaties and have unanimously called for "No more Hiroshimas, Nagasakis, or Bikinis" proves that we are all deeply concerned about the cause of maintaining peace.

Your brave struggle against racial discrimination is supported by women all over the world. These and many other actions show that you will no longer allow colonial rulers to decide your destiny.

Therefore, women welcome the Bandung Conference based on the principles of peaceful coexistence. These principles also mean mutual respect, help, and cooperation in a spirit of understanding and friendship.

Sisters, our task is arduous, but the ten principles of the Bandung Conference open up great possibilities for advancing our struggle. Through the implementation of these principles, freedom can be obtained and maintained, economic and social progress can be achieved, and the possibility of preventing war and resolving international disputes through peaceful negotiations will be greatly increased.

Dear Asian and African sisters! Women all over the world stand with you and support your just demands.

You have already achieved or are beginning to achieve victories; you have proved what a great force you are, and can become an even stronger force. Whether you are working there, at home, in the fields or factories, in the market or in the office, or as teachers, nurses or doctors, our common interests unite us.

From this meeting, we call on you to unite and cooperate with all women in the common aspiration and activities for peace, our rights, and the happiness of all children. We call on you to strive for the implementation of the Bandung principles. We call on you to strive to increase the friendship of women all over the world.

United, we can move forward, because the future belongs to us.

    告亚洲、非洲妇女书
    亲爱的姊妹们：
    1956年4月24日到30日在北京举行会议的国际民主妇女联合会理事会，以它所团结的千百万妇女的名义，向你们，正在为反对贫困和愚昧进行勇敢的斗争的妇女，以及为争取自己和孩子们的更美好的生活进行积极斗争的妇女，致以最热烈的敬意。你们在本国人民把自己从殖民统治下解放出来的斗争和愿望中起着极大的作用；你们很知道这种殖民统治，是你们的痛苦的主要原因。
    在你们的积极参加下，许多国家的人民已经从殖民主义支配下获得了自由。这些胜利鼓舞了我们在亚非其他地区还未获得自由的姊妹们在争取自己的解放的斗争中起更大作用。我们向一切参加本国人民争取民族独立和主权的斗争的英勇姊妹们致敬。我们向一切正以更大的热情站立起来要求结束殖民统治的姊妹们致意。
    那些打破了殖民统治枷锁的亚非国家人民，正担负起责任来保卫新赢得的独立，充分使用本国资源和发展文化。全世界妇女一致愿望争取人民更好的生活条件，妇女的充分权利和孩子们的幸福。
    在亚非遭到严重失败的殖民国家，正在采用新的方法危害自由。它们抱着这种目的，挑拨种族和宗教偏见；把人民驱出家乡；继续着战争准备；加强侵略性的军事条约；建立军事基地；提供附带政治、经济和军事条件的所谓经济援助；进行着可怕的核子武器的试验。
    所有这一切威胁到最近争取到的国际紧张局势的一定程度的缓和。
    只有在一个和平的世界里，一切妇女的共同愿望才能得到实现。我们世界各处的妇女反对一切侵略性的条约。妇女们采取了行动反对巴格达和东南亚条约，异口同声地呼吁“不许广岛、长崎或比基尼重演”，这证明我们全都深切关心维护和平的事业。
    你们反对种族歧视的勇敢斗争得到全世界妇女的支持。这些以及其他许多行动表明了，你们将不再允许殖民统治者来决定你们的命运。
    因此，妇女欢迎万隆会议的基于和平共处的原则。这些原则也意味着本着谅解和友好精神的互相尊重、帮助和合作。
    姊妹们，我们的任务是艰巨的，但是万隆会议的十项原则为推进我们的斗争开辟了巨大的可能性。通过这些原则的实施，能够获得和维护自由，取得经济和社会的进步，而防止战争和通过和平谈判解决国际争端的可能性将更加增大。
    亲爱的亚非姊妹们！全世界妇女和你们站在一起，支持你们的正义要求。
    你们已经取得或正在开始取得胜利；你们已经证明你们是一支多么巨大的力量，而且能够成为更强大的力量。不论你们是在那里工作，在家里、在田地或工厂里、在市场或办公室里，或者是教员、护士或医生，我们的共同利益使我们团结一致。
    我们从这次会议上号召你们在争取和平、我们的权利和一切儿童的幸福的共同愿望和活动中，同一切妇女团结合作。我们号召你们努力争取万隆原则的实施。我们号召你们努力增进全世界妇女的友谊。
    团结起来，我们就能够前进，因为未来是属于我们的。
