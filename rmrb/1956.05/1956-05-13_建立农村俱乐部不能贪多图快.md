Building Rural Clubs Should Not Be Greedy and Impatient
By People's Daily Commentator

Rural clubs have been established in large numbers recently. Especially around the Spring Festival of 1956, rural cultural work has greatly developed. Most of these rural clubs are good and have played a certain role in conducting socialist education for farmers, enhancing their enthusiasm for labor, and enlivening cultural life.

However, at present, many places have exhibited phenomena of greed for quantity and speed, disregard for results, extravagance and waste, and abuse of civilian labor in carrying out rural cultural work. Some places, regardless of conditions and circumstances, have used rapid and vigorous methods to establish rural clubs in every cooperative in the county within a few days, but after a long time, they still don't know how to do the work. Some clubs emphasize grandeur, purchasing drums, horns, violins, accordions, etc., costing as much as 2,000 yuan, many of which the farmers do not know how to use at all; while cultural tools that were effective and popular with farmers in the past, such as blackboards and broadcasting trumpets, are discarded as "outdated." Some places blindly build large clubhouses, some organize so-called thousand-person choirs, and some even plan to purchase televisions in 1957. Some rural club libraries purchase hundreds of yuan of newspapers and periodicals every quarter and purchase hundreds or even thousands of yuan of books at a time. Some special districts and counties, in order to make things "spectacular," hold various large-scale performances excessively, wasting manpower and money, and affecting production.

The result of this approach will inevitably increase the burden on the farmers, gradually detach rural cultural work from the masses, weaken the practical effect of the work, and create many difficulties for themselves. This is a complete violation of the principle of "running cooperatives diligently and thriftily." The "Joint Directive on Running Cooperatives Diligently and Thriftily" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on April 3, 1956, pointed out: "The various tasks proposed in the 'National Agricultural Development Program (Draft)' are goals to strive for within twelve years and should be gradually realized in batches, in stages, and by item, according to the different conditions in each locality. They must not be fully implemented all at once, demanding that they be fully realized within three or two years." "The cultural and welfare undertakings of cooperatives can only be gradually carried out with the development of production. Some of them should and can be carried out currently (such as temporary nurseries and night schools), and we should strive to save money and keep them simple and unadorned. We must not spend a lot of manpower and material resources to run cultural and welfare undertakings soon after the establishment of the cooperative." Those who are keen on greed for quantity and speed, extravagance and waste, should immediately and seriously study and implement this instruction, which has great and profound political significance, and correct the incorrect practices.

Rural clubs should be widely established, but they must be established in batches and in stages according to the different conditions of local production and cultural development. When establishing clubs, we must act according to our capabilities, pay attention to practical results, and better exert the power of the original cultural tools in rural areas, rather than spending too much manpower and material resources. We hope that the cultural authorities in various places will be able to send some staff members to go deep into the countryside to inspect the work of rural clubs. If they find good clubs that conform to the principle of diligence and thrift, are indeed effective, and are welcomed by farmers, they should help summarize experiences, commend them, and promote them; and for those bad clubs that are extravagant, pursue formality, and are divorced from the masses, they should help summarize lessons and correct them. Letting things take their course or simply pursuing quantity is not right.

    建立农村俱乐部不能贪多图快
    本报评论员
    农村俱乐部在最近一个时期，建立了很多。特别是1956年春节前后，农村文化工作有了很大的发展。这些农村俱乐部大多数是好的，在对农民进行社会主义教育、提高劳动热情、活跃文化生活上，起了一定作用。
    但是，目前也有不少地方在开展农村文化工作中，出现了贪多图快、不问效果、铺张浪费、滥用民力的现象。有的地方不顾条件、不分情况，用雷厉风行的突击办法，几天之内在全县每个合作社都建立了农村俱乐部，结果建立了好久，还不知道怎么去做工作。有的俱乐部讲究气派，购置鼓、号、小提琴、手风琴等等，所费达到两千元之多，许多东西目前农民群众根本还不会使用；而过去用之有效、为农民喜闻乐见的文化工具，如黑板报、广播筒等，却被弃置一边，说是“过时了”。有的地方盲目地建筑很大的俱乐部用屋，有的地方组织所谓千人合唱团，甚至有规划在1957年购置电视机的。有的农村俱乐部图书馆每季购报刊成百元，一次购买图书百元或数百元。有些专区和县，为了搞得“轰轰烈烈”，过多地举行各种规模很大的会演，劳民伤财，影响生产。
    这种作法的结果，一定要加重了农民群众的负担，使农村文化工作逐渐脱离群众，减弱工作的实际效果，并且会给自己造成许多困难。这是完全违反“勤俭办社”的方针的。中共中央和国务院1956年4月3日的“关于勤俭办社的联合指示”里指出：“全国农业发展纲要（草案）”所提出的各项任务，是在十二年内奋斗的目标，应当按照各地不同的情况，分批分期分项目地逐步实现，绝不能一下子全面展开，要求在三两年之内全部实现。”“合作社的文化福利事业，只能随着生产的发展逐步举办，有一部分是当前应当举办也可以举办的（例如临时性的托儿站、夜校），则应当力求节省，简单朴素。绝不能在合作社成立不久，就耗费大量的人力、物力，来兴办文化福利事业。”那些热中于贪多图快、铺张浪费的人们，应该对这个具有巨大的深刻的政治意义的指示，即时认真地学习和贯彻，并将做得不正确的地方加以纠正。
    农村俱乐部是应当广泛建立的，但是，必须根据当地生产和文化发展的不同情况，分批分期地建立。在建立俱乐部的时候，要量力而行，讲究实效，更好地发挥农村中原有文化工具的力量，而不要过多地耗费人力物力。我们希望各地文化主管部门最好能抽调一些工作人员深入农村，对农村俱乐部的工作进行检查。发现那些合乎勤俭的方针，确实收效，为农民所欢迎的好的俱乐部，就帮助总结经验，加以表扬和推广；而对那些铺张浪费、追求形式、脱离群众的不好的俱乐部，就帮助总结教训，加以纠正。放任自流或者仅仅追求数量，是不对的。
