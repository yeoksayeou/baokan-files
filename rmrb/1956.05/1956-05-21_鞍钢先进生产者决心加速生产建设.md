Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 20th - Representatives who attended the National Advanced Producers Representative Conference, upon returning to Anshan Iron and Steel, resolved to accelerate the production and construction of Anshan Iron and Steel with new achievements. Meng Tai, youth work section chief of the Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant, stated that he would be a good "doctor" for the blast furnace, better maintain the blast furnace, and extend the life of the blast furnace, so that blast furnaces requiring major repairs would be converted to medium repairs, medium repairs to minor repairs, and minor repairs to emergency repairs or no repairs. In this way, the blast furnace can produce more iron, ensuring the completion of the task of increasing the nation's pig iron production by 140,000 tons this year. Steelmaking foreman Wang Linghao is determined to unite steelworkers to produce good steel, improve the quality of steel, and supply the country's large-scale construction with more high-quality steel.

Zhang Mingshan, the creator of the small rolling mill's anti-surrounding plate, after learning advanced steel rolling experiences from steel mills in Tianjin and Shanghai, is preparing to work with the workers to increase from rolling two steel bars at a time to rolling three or four steel bars at a time. The steel bar forming workshop of Anshan Metallurgical Chemical Construction Corporation has already reached a mechanization level of 60%. Advanced producer representative Huang Demao, after returning, stated that he would work together with the workers to fully implement mechanized production in the steel bar forming workshop before this year's National Day. Sun Zhaosen, chief engineer of the Electrical Installation Engineering Company, is willing to use the "chain" teaching method to impart existing electrical installation technology to all technical personnel and workers.

    鞍钢先进生产者决心加速生产建设
    新华社鞍山20日电　出席过全国先进生产者代表会议的代表回到鞍山后，决心以新的成就来加速鞍钢的生产建设。鞍钢炼铁厂青年工段长孟太，表示要给高炉当个好“医生”，更好地维护高炉，延长高炉的寿命，使原来高炉要大修理的改为中修，中修的改为小修，小修的改为抢修或不修。这样，就能使高炉出更多的铁，保证完成在今年内再为国家增产十四万吨生铁的任务。炼钢工长王凌好决心团结炼钢工人炼好钢，提高钢的质量，供应国家大规模建设以更多的优质钢。
    小型轧钢厂反围盘的创造者张明山学习了天津、上海等钢厂轧钢的先进经验后，准备和工人们一起，从现在一次轧两根钢材提高到一次轧三根、四根钢材。鞍山冶金化学建筑总公司钢筋成型车间，现在的机械化程度已经达到60％了。先进生产者代表黄德茂回来以后，他表示要和工人们共同努力，在今年国庆节以前使钢筋成型车间全部实行机械化生产。电气安装工程公司总工程师孙照森愿以“连锁”教学的方法，把现有电气安装技术传授给全体技术人员和工人。
