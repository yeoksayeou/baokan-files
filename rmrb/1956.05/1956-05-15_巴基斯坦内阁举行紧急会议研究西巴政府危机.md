Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, May 13th: The crisis in the West Pakistan Provincial Government has caused serious concern to the Pakistan Government. The Pakistan Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Muhammad Ali, held an emergency meeting on May 11th to discuss the issue. The West Pakistan Provincial Assembly will hold a meeting on May 19th, and Prime Minister Ali, who has already announced a delay in his visit to China, will remain in Pakistan at that time.

The crisis in the West Pakistan Provincial Government was triggered by the West Pakistan Muslim League organization's demand that the original non-partisan Chief Minister of the provincial government, Sahib Khan, resign. The West Pakistan Muslim League parliamentary group, which holds a majority of seats in the Provincial Assembly, passed a resolution on April 3rd stating that only members of the Muslim League can serve as Chief Minister and Ministers of the provincial government, and demanded that the Governor appoint its newly elected leader, Bahadur Khan, as Chief Minister.

Prior to this, when Sahib Khan took office as Chief Minister of the West Pakistan Provincial Government last October, the Muslim League had pledged to support his government until the general election. Prime Minister Muhammad Ali issued a statement on March 28th, reiterating that the Muslim League would continue to cooperate with Sahib Khan.

On April 23rd, the All-Pakistan Muslim League Executive Committee decided to expel seven Muslim League members for refusing to comply with the order to resign from their ministerial positions in Sahib Khan's government.

On the same day, Sahib Khan announced the formation of a new political party called the Republican Party. Five of the seven Muslim League members who were expelled joined the party. According to newspaper reports at the time, West Pakistan provincial government sources estimated that 189 of the 306 members of the West Pakistan Provincial Assembly had expressed support for Sahib Khan and his government.

### 巴基斯坦内阁举行紧急会议研究西巴政府危机

    巴基斯坦内阁举行紧急会议研究西巴政府危机
    新华社喀喇蚩13日电　西巴基斯坦省政府的危机已经引起巴基斯坦政府的严重关切。以穆罕默德·阿里总理为首的巴基斯坦内阁在五月十一日举行了紧急会议，讨论这个问题。西巴基斯坦省议会将在五月十九日举行会议，已经宣布延迟访问中国日期的阿里总理届时将留在巴基斯坦。
    西巴基斯坦省政府危机是由于回教联盟西巴基斯坦省组织要求原来的无党派人士、省政府首席部长萨希布汗辞职而引起的。在省议会中占多数席位的回教联盟西巴基斯坦省议会党团四月三日通过决议说，只有回教联盟的盟员才能够担任省政府的首席部长和部长，并且要求省督任命新选出来的它的领袖巴哈杜尔汗为首席部长。
    在这以前，在萨希布汗去年十月就任西巴基斯坦省政府首席部长时，回教联盟曾经保证支持他的政府，直到大选时为止。穆罕默德·阿里总理在三月二十八日发表声明，重申回教联盟将继续同萨希布汗进行合作。
    四月二十三日，全巴基斯坦回教联盟执行委员会决定把七个回教联盟盟员开除，因为他们拒绝遵守要他们从萨希布汗政府中辞去他们所担任的部长职务的命令。
    同一天，萨希布汗宣布成立一个名叫共和党的新政党。七个被回教联盟开除的盟员有五个参加了这个党。据当时报纸报道，西巴基斯坦省政府人士计算，西巴基斯坦省议会三百零六名议员当中有一百八十九名议员已经表示支持萨希布汗和他的政府。
