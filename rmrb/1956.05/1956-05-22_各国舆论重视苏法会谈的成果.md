Xinhua News Agency, May 21st dispatch from Moscow: The Soviet "Pravda" published an editorial on the results of the Franco-Soviet talks on the 21st, entitled "Under the Banner of Peaceful Coexistence."

The editorial stated that the Franco-Soviet talks made an important contribution to the development and improvement of Franco-Soviet relations, and to the consolidation of universal peace and security. The talks showed that there are good relations between France and the Soviet Union, based on the long-standing traditional friendship between the two peoples. This relationship is developing on the basis of mutual understanding and respect. The joint efforts of the Soviet Union and France can largely promote the victory of the policy of peaceful coexistence and cooperation between countries. The statement of the talks clearly reflects the desire of the two governments to implement this policy.

On the other hand, the Franco-Soviet talks marked the beginning of a new and important stage in the rapprochement between the two countries in economic and cultural fields, providing the most favorable opportunities for trade between the Soviet Union and France, and now both sides must make the most of this opportunity.

The editorial emphasized that those enemies of Franco-Soviet friendship who predicted the failure of the Franco-Soviet talks have once again lagged far behind the development of international life. The French and Soviet peoples will strengthen and develop their friendship. The Soviet public is deeply convinced that this friendship will be an important factor in completely eliminating the "Cold War", stopping the arms race, and achieving lasting international peace.

An Important Contribution to Consolidating World Peace
·Comments from Many French Newspapers·
Xinhua News Agency according to TASS, Paris: Most Parisian newspapers, in commenting on the results of the talks between the government delegations of the Soviet Union and France, emphasized that the talks promoted the improvement of relations between the two countries in all aspects, and were an important contribution to consolidating universal peace and security.

The "Le Monde" of May 19th, in reporting "Successful Conclusion of Franco-Soviet Talks," wrote that "international tensions will continue to ease, and even ease faster." The newspaper believes that the talks helped to eliminate distrust and convinced those who participated in the talks of each other's sincerity. The newspaper concluded by writing, "In this regard, the talks have brought undeniable benefits."

"France Soir" pointed out that during the talks, specific results were achieved in developing Soviet-French trade relations. The newspaper believes that the talks have brought the following good results to France in particular: international tensions will continue to ease, and only in this case can France solve its internal problems, and the distrust between East and West will be reduced.

"L'Humanité Dimanche" attaches great importance to the issues on which the Soviet Union and France have reached an agreement. The newspaper wrote that, despite the existence of differences on some issues, the main achievement of the talks lies in: reaching "agreements that mean another defeat for the 'Cold War'."

The Beginning of the Restoration of Cooperation between the Soviet Union and France
·Comments from Newspapers of European People's Democratic Countries·
Xinhua News Agency according to TASS: Newspapers of European People's Democratic countries value the results of the talks between the leaders of the Soviet Union and France.

Poland's "Trybuna Ludu" and other central newspapers unanimously emphasized that the Soviet-French talks contributed to the consolidation of universal peace. "Życie Warszawy" wrote that the statement of the Franco-Soviet talks is of great significance because it is the beginning of the restoration of cooperation between the Soviet Union and France. It laid a practical foundation for further strengthening the belief that the Cold War policy can be eliminated and the arms race can be stopped. The newspaper also said that the visit of the French national leader to Moscow undoubtedly achieved success for the cause of peace. All those who cherish peace and like the tendency of international relations to ease regard the Moscow talks as a major contribution to the policy of the "Geneva spirit".

Hungary's "Szabad Nép", "Magyar Nemzet" and other central newspapers warmly welcomed the results of the Franco-Soviet talks. The newspapers emphasized the great significance of the talks for the consolidation of peace and international cooperation, and believed that the talks once again convincingly proved that peaceful coexistence and cooperation between countries with different political and economic systems is possible. "Szabad Nép" wrote that the talks once again proved that even if there are differences between the two sides on various issues, a way to cooperate can be found as long as there is sincerity.

An Important Stage in East-West Reconciliation
·Commentary from the Yugoslavian "Politika"·
Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade via Yugoslav News Agency: "Politika" commented on the 21st on the talks held in Moscow between the leaders of the Soviet Union and France, saying that the talks between Paris and Moscow could become one of the most important stages in the gradual reconciliation between East and West, especially if people remember this: although Paris continues to be loyal to the West, it has been unswervingly struggling to abandon the shackles of blind bloc politics in the past few months.

The newspaper pointed out that the reconciliation that Paris and Moscow may achieve based on the principle of coexistence is perhaps the most far-reaching result of the Moscow talks. France and the Soviet Union are closer than before, they understand each other better, and the basis and scope of mutual cooperation have also been defined, which is an important encouraging force for the reconciliation of Europe.

    社论说，法苏会谈对发展和改善法苏关系、对巩固普遍和平和安全作出了重要的贡献。会谈表明，法苏之间存在着以两国人民多年传统的友谊为基础的良好关系。这种关系在相互谅解和尊重的基础上发展着。苏联和法国的共同努力可以在很大程度上促进国与国之间的和平共处和合作的政策的胜利。会谈的声明中鲜明地反映了两国政府执行这种政策的愿望。

    “法兰西晚报”指出，在会谈过程中，在发展苏法贸易关系方面取得了具体的成果。报纸认为，会谈特别给法国带来了下列良好的结果：国际紧张局势将继续缓和，只有在这种情况下法国才能解决自己的内部问题，东西方的不信任才会减少。
    “人道报星期日刊”非常重视苏联和法国已经取得协议的那些问题。报纸写道，尽管在某些问题上还存在分歧，但是会谈的主要成果在于：达成了“这样的协议，这些协议意味着‘冷战’的再次失败”。

    新华社据塔斯社讯　欧洲人民民主国家的报纸重视苏法两国领导人会谈的结果。
    波兰的“人民论坛报”和其他中央一级报纸一致着重指出，苏法会谈有助于巩固普遍和平。“华沙生活报”写道，苏法会谈声明具有重大的意义，因为它是苏联和法国两国恢复合作的开端。它为进一步加强下面这种信念奠定实际的基础，这种信念是：冷战政策是可以消除的，扩充军备是可以停止的。这家报纸还说，法国国家领导人的访问莫斯科毫无疑问地使和平事业取得了成就。凡是珍视和平、喜欢国际关系趋向缓和的人，都把莫斯科会谈看成是对“日内瓦精神”政策的重大贡献。

    东西方和解的重要阶段
    ·南斯拉夫“政治报”的评论·
    新华社据南斯拉夫通讯社贝尔格莱德讯　“政治报”二十一日评论苏联和法国领导人在莫斯科举行的会谈说，巴黎和莫斯科之间的会谈可以成为东西方之间逐渐取得和解的最重要的阶段之一，特别是如果人们记住这一点：巴黎虽然继续忠实于西方，但是在过去的几个月中一直在坚持不渝地为抛弃盲目的集团政策的枷锁而斗争。
    这家报纸指出，巴黎和莫斯科之间根据共处原则可能取得的和解，或许是莫斯科会谈的最深远的结果。法国和苏联比以前接近了，它们彼此更加了解了，相互合作的基础和范围也已经规定，这是对欧洲的和解的一个重要的鼓舞力量。
