    Textile Factory's Canteen for Pregnant Women
    The pregnant female workers of the state-owned Shanghai No. 9 Cotton Textile Factory are very fond of the pregnant women's canteen specially set up for them. Since the opening of this canteen in June last year, the appetite of more than 680 pregnant women who have eaten in this canteen has generally improved, their food intake has increased, and the symptoms of nausea and poor appetite that are common in the early stages of pregnancy have been alleviated.
    On the 8th, a reporter visited this canteen. The canteen is located far away from the kitchen and the large dining hall, and there is no oily smell that can easily cause nausea in pregnant women. Outside is a small garden, and the interior is painted white and decorated with potted plants. The menu for the day was salted vegetable and broad bean stewed tofu skin wrapped in meat, lettuce fish cutlets, and pickled mustard tuber and shredded pork soup, with rice, steamed buns, and porridge as staples. Twenty or thirty pregnant women on the early shift were eating lunch while chatting and laughing, with salted vegetables, vinegar, and chili peppers on the table for seasoning. The workshop health worker in white clothes asked them about their health one by one at the table and asked them what side dishes they liked to eat. Female worker Zhou Xiaomei ate three steamed buns and a bowl of porridge for this meal. She said to her companion with a smile, "I have never eaten so much before!"
    The cook of this canteen told the reporter that they specially prepare more than 100 kinds of light and delicious side dishes for pregnant women, and they also supply soup noodles, wontons, and salted rice porridge three times a week. The price of each of these side dishes does not exceed 15 cents. Now there are more than 120 people eating here every day.
    This canteen is one of the best-run among the more than ten pregnant women's canteens currently existing in Shanghai textile factories. The experience of this canteen has been promoted to other textile factories. In the second quarter, pregnant women's canteens will be universally opened in textile factories in Shanghai. On the 8th, staff from the state-owned Shanghai No. 16 Cotton Textile Factory and Jiading Jiafeng Yarn Factory were learning from their experience in this canteen. (Xinhua News Agency)

    纺织厂的孕妇食堂
    国营上海第九棉纺织厂的怀孕女工们非常喜欢专门为她们设立的孕妇食堂。从去年六月这个食堂开办以来，在这个食堂用过饭的六百八十多个孕妇的胃口普遍变好，饭量增加，怀孕初期容易恶心、吃不下饭的现象都减轻了。
    八日记者参观了这个食堂。食堂的位置远离厨房和大饭厅，一点也闻不到容易引起孕妇恶心的油腥味。它的外面是一个小花园，内部粉刷得洁白，屋中还装饰着盆景。这天的菜单是咸菜蚕豆烧豆腐衣包肉、莴苣鱼排和榨菜肉丝汤，饭食有大米饭、馒头和粥。二三十个早班的怀孕女工正在有说有笑地吃中饭，桌面上放着咸菜、醋、辣椒等调味。穿着白衣服的车间保健员挨个在桌边询问她们的健康状况，并且问她们喜欢吃什么小菜。女工周小妹这一顿吃了三只馒头一碗粥，她笑着向同伴说：“我可是从来也没有吃过这么多呀！”
    这个食堂的炊事员对记者说，他们专门为孕妇烹饪的清淡、可口的各种小菜有一百多种，每星期还供应三次汤面、馄饨和咸泡饭。这些小菜每份都不超过一角五分。现在每天在这里用饭的有一百二十多人。
    这个食堂是上海市纺织厂中现有的十多个孕妇食堂中办得最好的一个。这个食堂的经验已经向其他纺织厂推广。第二季度内上海市的纺织工厂要普遍开办孕妇食堂。八日这天就有国营上海第十六棉纺织厂和嘉定嘉丰纱厂的工作人员在这个食堂里学习他们的经验。（新华社）
