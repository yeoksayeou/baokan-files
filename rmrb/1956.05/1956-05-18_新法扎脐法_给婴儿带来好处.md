    “New Umbilical Cord Ligation Method” Benefits Infants
    A "New Umbilical Cord Ligation Method" that allows infants to quickly shed their umbilical cords is currently being widely promoted by the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Hunan Provincial Changsha Hospital.
    The "New Umbilical Cord Ligation Method" was successfully researched in March of this year by Tan Chuying, a young midwife in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Changsha Hospital. When ligating the infant's umbilical cord, she places the first tie close to the umbilical ring, forcing the blood towards the severed end, and then applies the second tie, accelerating the drying time of the umbilical cord and reducing the chances of the infant contracting diseases.
    With the support of the hospital, Tan Chuying introduced this experience to midwife Liao Shiwang, and the two conducted a total of twenty experiments. Among them, four umbilical cords fell off in two days, seven in three days, five in four days, three in five days, and one in six days.

    “新法扎脐法”给婴儿带来好处
    一种使婴儿迅速脱掉脐带的“新法扎脐法”，目前正在湖南省立长沙医院妇产科全面推广。
    “新法扎脐法”，是长沙医院妇产科青年助产士谭储英在今年三月研究成功的。她在扎系婴儿脐带的时候，将第一道线靠近脐轮，使血挤向断头，然后再接第二道线，加速了脐带干枯的时间，减少了婴儿感染疾病的机会。
    谭储英在医院的支持下，曾把这一经验介绍给助产士廖时旺，两人共做了二十个试验。其中两天掉脐带的四个，三天掉的七个，四天掉的五个，五天掉的三个，六天掉的一个。
