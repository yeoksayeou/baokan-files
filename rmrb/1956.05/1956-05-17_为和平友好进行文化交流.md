    Cultural Exchange for Peace and Friendship
    Ouyang Yuqian
    Last year, the Japanese Kabuki troupe, led by Mr. Ennosuke Ichikawa, accepted the invitation of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries to visit and perform in our country. Now, the Chinese Peking Opera Delegation, led by Mr. Mei Lanfang, is invited by the Japanese Asahi Shimbun to perform in Japan. This is a manifestation of the friendship between the two peoples and will help further the cultural exchange between the two countries. I am very happy to be able to participate in this delegation and revisit this old haunt.
    I studied in Japan. As far as the subjects I studied at the time (commerce) were concerned, I was not a good student: I never mastered bookkeeping, and I had long since returned commercial science and monetary theory to the teacher; but on the other hand, I was indeed influenced by Takeo Kawai and Ryokuro Kitamura in learning new drama, and I was also captivated by Baiko Onoe's acting. In literature, I was a private student of Dr. Shoyo Tsubouchi. I often loved to read the works and papers of Japanese playwrights, and I have always been friends with many Japanese playwrights such as Kaoru Osanai and Jun'ichirō Tanizaki. I was just a child when I first went to Japan, and my childhood memories are exceptionally dear. Even now, I always find Japan lovely. I love the high mountains and great rivers of China, and I also love the mountains and rivers of Japan. Looking at the snow-capped Mount Fuji from the azure sea is so white, so majestic, so strong and towering, symbolizing the noble qualities and inviolable national self-esteem of the Japanese people, who are hardworking, brave, and full of wisdom. I love Guan Hanqing, Wang Shifu, and Tang Xianzu, and I also love Chikamatsu, Namiki, and Mokuami. The Chinese people highly respect their own cultural traditions and also respect the cultural traditions of other countries. They are willing to learn from them and use them as a mirror, believing that mutual cultural exchange can make human life richer and more beautiful. It is no wonder that last year's Japanese Kabuki performance was warmly welcomed by people all over China. We are also very happy to introduce Chinese Peking Opera to the vast Japanese people.
    The Japanese and Chinese peoples have always been friendly, and cultural exchanges between them have never been interrupted. Counting it all up, there are more than two thousand years of friendship. The period of unfriendliness caused by Japanese militarism was roughly a little more than half a century. Which is longer, fifty or sixty years or more than two thousand years? Because of the mischief of Japanese militarism, the Chinese people suffered losses, and the Japanese people also suffered losses. We sympathize with the Japanese people. There is no reason why our two peoples cannot join hands. It's like two brothers who were originally on good terms. If you have to build a wall to separate them, it's ridiculous to think about it carefully. In fact, equality and mutual benefit, exchange of what one has for what one lacks, cultural exchange, and mutual learning are all beneficial to everyone. In fact, there is nothing that must be resolved by fighting. If you want to deliberately create estrangement, then why? What's the benefit? Sober and kind people can see this clearly. Japan is an advanced industrial country, and there are many things worth learning in science and art. We hope not to miss any opportunity to learn. Mr. Mei Lanfang has also been to Japan before. This time, we can meet many old friends, which will undoubtedly further increase new friendships. People always want happiness, and peace is the root of happiness, and friendship is the foundation of peace. Striving for peace and promoting friendship is in line with the wishes of the Chinese and Japanese peoples. The theatrical artists of the two countries have already extended friendly hands to each other, and have extended friendly hands to the broad masses of the two countries. We are very happy to use our best roles and perform what we think are the best plays to meet the Japanese people and bring the friendship of the Chinese people to the Japanese people, in return for the friendship of the Japanese people brought to China by the Japanese Kabuki troupe.

    为和平友好进行文化交流
    欧阳予倩
    去年，以市川猿之助先生等为首的日本歌舞伎剧团接受中国对外文化协会的邀请到我国来作访问演出，现在以梅兰芳先生为首的中国访日京剧代表团受日本朝日新闻的邀请到日本演出，这是两国人民友好的表现，有助于两国文化交流的进一步开展。我以能参加这个代表团重访旧游之地感到十分高兴。
    我在日本留过学。就我当时所学的科目（商科）来说，我不是个好学生：簿记棒始终没有使用纯熟，商品学、货币论早已还给了先生；但在另一方面，我学新剧的确受了河合武雄、喜多村绿郎的影响，尾上梅幸的演技我也曾为之倾倒。在文学方面我曾为坪内逍遥博士的私洲弟子。日本剧作家的作品和论文我经常爱读，日本的许多戏剧家如小山内熏、谷崎润一郎诸氏我一直和他们作朋友。我最初到日本的时候还是个小孩子，童年的回忆异常亲切，一直到现在我总觉得日本可爱。我爱中国各地的高山大河，也爱日本的山水。从蔚蓝的海上望积雪的富士山，是那样洁白，那样雄伟，那样坚强高峻，象征着日本人民勤劳勇敢、富于智慧的高贵品质和不可侵犯的民族自尊心。我爱关汉卿、王实甫和汤显祖，也爱近松、并木、默阿弥。中国人民极为尊重自己的文化传统，也同样尊重其他各国的文化传统，愿向它们学习借镜，认为相互间的文化交流可以使人类的生活日趋丰富，日见美好。这就无怪去年日本歌舞伎会在中国受到各地人民的热烈欢迎。我们也很高兴把中国京剧介绍给广大的日本人民。
    日本人民和中国人民历来是友好的，彼此间文化交流也从来没有断过。算一算总有二千年以上的交谊吧。被日本军国主义弄得不友好的时期，大体是半个世纪多一点。五六十年和二千多年比，究竟是那一边长一些呢？由于日本军国主义作怪，中国人民吃了亏，日本人民也吃了亏。我们是同情日本人民的。我们两国人民没有不能携手的理由，好比两弟兄原来和好，一定要筑上一堵墙把他们隔开，仔细想想会觉得可笑的。其实平等互惠，互通有无，文化交流，互相学习，大家都有好处。事实上没有什么必须要打一架才能解决的事。如果想故意弄得彼此隔阂，那又是为什么呢？有什么好处呢？这一点清醒和善良的人都能看得清楚。日本是一个先进的工业国，无论在科学方面、文艺方面，都有很多东西值得我们学习，我们希望不放过任何学习机会。梅兰芳先生以前也到过日本，我们这一次可以会到很多老朋友，无疑地将进一步增加新的友情。人总是要求幸福的，和平就是幸福的根源，友好就是和平的基础。争取和平，增进友好是符合中日两国人民的愿望的。两国的戏剧艺术家们早已互相伸出了友谊的手，并互相向两国广大群众伸出了友谊的手。我们很乐于用我们最好的角色，演我们认为最好的戏，和日本人民相见，把中国人民的友谊带给日本人民，以答谢日本歌舞伎剧团到中国所带来的日本人民的友谊。
