    Kalidasa
    --Guha's Speech (Summary)
    It is universally acknowledged that Kalidasa is India's greatest poet. Although we do not have precise knowledge of his life and times, the view generally accepted is that he lived during the Gupta dynasty, more specifically, at the end of the fourth century AD.

    Kalidasa's works reflect the glorious Gupta era, which has always been praised as India's ancient golden age and the Indian Renaissance. Broadly speaking, this era lasted for three and a half centuries, from the beginning of the third century AD to the middle of the seventh century. This era began after the turbulent period of foreign dynasties ruling over most of India's territory.

    The successive emperors of the Gupta dynasty brought a long period of peace to the people. This was also the era that the famous Chinese pilgrim Faxian so enthusiastically talked about in his travelogue to India. This was a great era, a great era for India, and a great era for China, with countless pilgrims traveling between the two countries at that time. The development of literature, art, and science in this era can be called the classical era of Indian culture. Its cultural brilliance far surpassed the life of the contemporary regime.

    The most important reason for this Renaissance can be said to be the replacement of vernacular languages by Sanskrit as the court language, and the high development of Sanskrit in literature thus occupied a prominent position.

    Kalidasa is the greatest representative of this culture. It is believed that his works, like the Ajanta murals, comprehensively and convincingly reflect this culture. On the one hand, he was deeply influenced by tradition and seemed to express "complete satisfaction with the current situation," on the other hand, he also revealed a personality that understood others and cared about suffering. He was a happy and amiable person, he sympathized with the pain and emotions of women and children, he keenly felt the beauty of flowers, trees, birds, and animals, and at the same time, he also had a longing for the luxurious scenes of the court.

    Kalidasa wrote three plays, two long poems and two shorter poems, and several other works that have not been passed down. The two long poems are "Raghu Dynasty" and "Kumārasambhava," and the shorter lyric poem is "Meghadūta." These works are all treasures of Sanskrit poetry. Kalidasa's most famous work is his play "Shakuntala." The other two plays he wrote are a comedy with a tortuous plot: "Malavikagnimitra" (Malavika and Agnimitra); and "Vikramorvasiyam," won by valor. This is an ancient legend that tells the love story of King Pururavas and a celestial nymph. Shakuntala is based on the epic "Mahabharata," but Kalidasa made some detailed but significant changes to the original text, and added some new characters and plots, injecting new vitality into the original work. Kalidasa describes a tortuous love story, while embellishing it with an atmosphere of bravery and nobility.

    The "Mahabharata" was originally a simple story, but Kalidasa's genius changed its original appearance. Kalidasa not only consciously made some rather minor but very dramatic modifications to the original plot, but also created its protagonist, Shakuntala, into a deeply moving and amorous character. He used consummate artistry to depict Shakuntala's budding tenderness. This first love is pure and flawless, completely untouched by worldly contamination.

    Shakuntala, this flawless character, has always amazed and admired poets. Goethe's famous quatrain concentrates the poets' praise for her. We don't have time now to discuss Kalidasa's other works. In the creation of the image of Shakuntala, Kalidasa demonstrated the pinnacle of success in his dramatic art. At the same time, he is also highly praised for his style. This is an extremely beautiful work in Sanskrit. He is very simple, but in his use of metaphors and application of thought, he shows a rare sophistication and strength combined with beauty. His harmonious music, combined with a clear and sublime style, is unparalleled in the world. His quick metaphors are well known.

    Kalidasa is a product of the era in which he lived. He was loyal to the Brahmanical doctrines of the time, and he could only see the world as an order governed by a just fate. His compassion, although strong and profound, could not but be limited and influenced by his environment. However, what is important is this fact: within the limits of his essence and the limits given to him by his era, Kalidasa created a beautiful and sublime world in thought and emotion, a world that is as immortal as human civilization.

    迦梨陀娑
    ——古哈的讲话（摘要）
    大家都公认，迦梨陀娑是印度最伟大的诗人。对于他的生平和时代，我们虽然没有确切的了解，不过大多数人所接受的看法，是认为他生长在笈多王朝，更确切地说，认为他生长在公元第四世纪的末叶。
    迦梨陀娑的作品反映了光辉灿烂的笈多时代，这个时代一直被人誉为印度古代的黄金时代和印度的文艺复兴时代。从广义上来说，这个时代是从公元第三世纪初到第七世纪的中叶，延续共达三个半世纪。这个时代是在统治着印度大部分领土的外国王朝那个动乱时期以后开始的。
    笈多王朝的历代帝王给人民带来了一个长时期的太平生活。这个时代，也是中国著名朝圣者法显在自己赴印度的游记里那么热情地谈论着的时代。这是个伟大的时代，它是印度的伟大时代，也是中国的伟大时代，当时双方都有无数朝拜圣地的人在两国之间来往。这个时代的文学、艺术和科学之发达，堪称印度文化的古典时代。它在文化方面的光辉远远地超过了当代政权的生命。
    促成这个文艺复兴的最重要原因，可以说是由于梵语作为宫廷语言来代替了俗语，梵语在文学上的高度发展因而占了卓越的地位。
    迦梨陀娑是这种文化最伟大的代表。人们认为，他的著作，和阿旃陀壁画一样，全面而令人信服地反映了这种文化。他一方面深受传统的影响，并且似乎表示“对当时的情况完全满意，”另一方面，他也透露出一种了解他人和关心疾苦的个性。他是一个快乐和和善的人，他同情妇女和儿童的苦痛和各种情绪，他敏锐地感受到花木鸟兽的美，同时他对宫廷的豪华场面也不无憧憬。
    迦梨陀娑曾经写过三出戏，两首长诗和两首比较短的诗，还有另外几种作品都没有传下来。两首长诗是“罗库王朝”和“鸠摩罗出世”，比较短的一首抒情诗是“云使”，这几部作品都是梵文诗中的瑰宝。迦梨陀娑最著名的作品是他写的剧本“沙恭达罗”。他写的另外两出戏，一出是情节曲折的喜剧：“摩罗毗迦”（摩罗毗迦与火天友）；另外一出是“以勇武赢得的斌儿娃希”。这是一个古代的传说，叙述大号哭王和女仙的恋史。沙恭达罗取材于史诗“摩呵婆罗多”，但是迦梨陀娑在原文里面做了若干细节上的、但是很有意义的改动，同时添进了一些新的人物和情节，为原作灌输了新的活力。迦梨陀娑描述的是一个情节曲折的恋爱故事，同时以勇壮和高贵的气氛为点缀。
    “摩呵婆罗多”本来是一个简单的故事，可是迦梨陀娑的天才为它改变了本来面目。迦梨陀娑不仅就原来的情节，有意识地做了一些相当轻微但是非常富有戏剧意义的修改，而且还把它的主角沙恭达罗创造成一个深入人心的、多情绮丽的人物。他用炉火纯青的艺术，描绘出沙恭达罗含苞初放的柔情。这种初恋是纯洁无瑕、全然没有受俗世熏染的。
    沙恭达罗这个完美无瑕的人物，一直都使诗人们惊奇和赞美。哥德的著名的四行体诗，集中了诗人们对她的歌颂。我们现在没有时间来讨论迦梨陀娑的其他作品。在沙恭达罗的形象创造中，迦梨陀娑表现了他戏剧艺术登峰造极的成功。同时他在风格上也受到很高的评价。这是梵文中绝顶优美的作品。他很朴素，但在他使用比喻和运用思考中显示出一种稀有的练达和力量并同美相结合在一起。他的和谐的音乐，结合着明朗和崇高的风格，这是举世无双的。他的明捷的比喻是有口皆碑的。
    迦梨陀娑是他所生活的时代的产儿。他忠于当时的婆罗门教义，他只能把世界看成是在一个公正的命运所支配下的秩序。他的同情心，虽然强烈而且深厚，但不能不为他所处的环境所限制和影响。不过，重要的是这个事实：在他本质和他的时代所赋予的限制范围内，迦梨陀娑创造了一个思想上和感情上的美丽和崇高的世界，这个世界是与人类文明同样不朽的。
