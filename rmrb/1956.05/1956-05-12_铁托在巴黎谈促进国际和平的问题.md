Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 11th: According to the Yugoslav News Agency in Paris, Yugoslav President Tito delivered a speech at a banquet hosted by French Foreign Minister Pineau on the evening of May 10th, addressing the international situation and the issue of promoting peace.

　　Tito said: Under the bold and realistic leadership of its current government, France has taken many beneficial initiatives and strengthened its activities to capitalize on the possibilities of strengthening international trust and understanding. Tito expressed his belief that France, like Yugoslavia, is pleased with the significant improvement in the international situation and the resumption of methods of consultation and contact. He also said that Yugoslavia welcomes any initiative aimed at bringing the current two opposing camps closer together.

　　Tito said: Yugoslavia hopes to pursue an independent policy as it has done so far. Such a policy has been and will be beneficial to both East and West, which is to bring them closer together. We are regaining friends in the East, and we never want to abandon our friends in the West.

　　Tito then spoke about the necessity of implementing a policy of coexistence in international relations. Tito said that the policy of coexistence helps to consolidate peace more durably, and helps to strengthen the role and significance of the United Nations organization. Yugoslavia's foreign policy is firmly in the service of the purposes and charter of the United Nations.

　　Tito said, however, that only after reducing the accumulated distrust existing in the world will it be possible to implement a constructive policy more consistently and more fully in relations between countries, especially between major powers. We are convinced that this can only be achieved by restoring contact and exchanging views, through negotiations and mutual connections—especially in the economic and political fields, and by removing obstacles that still restrict the free trade of goods.

　　Tito emphasized that the French government is showing great activity in restoring contact and exchanging views in order to narrow and eliminate current international distrust. He particularly emphasized that even strengthening international trust through limited disarmament agreements would be a very realistic and beneficial initiative. Tito said that the disarmament issue today is not only about stopping the arms race and the accumulation of various weapons—including thermonuclear weapons—but also about leading to a path of further, broader, and more comprehensive international understanding.

    铁托在巴黎谈促进国际和平的问题
    新华社11日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社巴黎消息：南斯拉夫总统铁托五月十日晚间在法国外交部长比诺招待他的宴会上发表演说，谈到国际局势和促进和平的问题。
    铁托说：法国在它的现政府的大胆和现实的领导下，已经采取许多有益的主动行动，并且加强了活动，以利用加强国际信任和谅解的可能性。铁托表示相信，法国同南斯拉夫一样，对国际形势已经大大改善、协商和接触的方法已经恢复，感到满意。他并且说，南斯拉夫欢迎任何旨在使目前的两个敌对的阵营接近起来的倡议。
    铁托说：南斯拉夫希望奉行像迄今所奉行的这样一种独立政策。这样一种政策过去曾经而且将来也将对东方和西方都有好处，这就是使它们靠拢在一起。我们在东方正在再得到朋友，我们决不希望抛弃我们在西方的朋友。
    铁托然后谈到在国际关系方面执行共处政策的必要性。铁托说，共处政策有助于更持久地巩固和平，有助于加强联合国组织的作用和意义，南斯拉夫的外交政策是坚决为联合国的目的和宪章服务的。
    铁托说，但是，只有在减少了世界上存在的日积月累的不信任以后，才有可能在各国之间、主要是各大国之间的关系上更加一贯地和更加充分地执行一种建设性的政策。我们深信，只有通过恢复接触和交换意见、通过谈判和相互联系——特别是在经济和政治方面、通过扫除仍然限制着货物的自由交易的障碍等办法，才能实现这个目的。
    铁托强调指出，法国政府为了缩小和消除目前国际上的不信任，正在恢复接触和交换意见方面表现得十分活跃。他特别强调指出，甚至通过有限的裁军协议来加强国际信任的办法也会是一个非常现实和有益的创议。铁托说，今天的裁军问题不仅是制止军备竞赛和各种武器——包括热核子武器在内——的积聚，而且是导向更进一步的、更广泛的和更全面的国际谅解的一条道路。
