    Improving Historical Science Research
    -- In Commemoration of the 15th Anniversary of Comrade Mao Zedong's "Reform Our Study"
    Yin Da, Member of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences
    In May 1941, Comrade Mao Zedong delivered the report "Reform Our Study" at the Yan'an Cadre Meeting, marking the beginning of the rectification movement fifteen years ago. In February 1942, Comrade Mao Zedong delivered two more reports, "Rectify the Party's Style of Work" and "Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing." These three articles are fundamental documents of the rectification movement. In these articles, the tendencies of subjectivism, sectarianism, and dogmatism were strongly criticized. After repeated in-depth study, the broad masses of cadres greatly improved ideologically, and the Party was united as never before.

    In this article, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward extremely valuable opinions on the research work of our country's historical science. These opinions, put forward fifteen years ago, are still extremely relevant to the current state of our historical science. It is quite necessary to examine the current work of historical science based on these instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong.

    In this article, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out the harm of subjectivism and dogmatism to the revolution and to scientific theory; he asked us to find our stand, viewpoints, and methods from the theory of Marxism-Leninism, to scientifically analyze objectively existing practical things, to synthesize and study them, and to discover their internal connections and their laws. He wanted us to treat theoretical research with a realistic and truth-seeking attitude. Comrade Mao Zedong said that "facts" are all things that exist objectively, "truth" is the internal connection of objective things, that is, regularity, and "seeking" is our research. This realistic and truth-seeking style is precisely the style of unifying theory with practice.

    "Reform Our Study" has been published for fifteen years. In these fifteen years, although our historical science work has achieved certain results and made some progress; especially in recent years, theoretical debates on some important issues in Chinese history have been initially launched, and most historians have begun to use Marxism-Leninism to explore some important issues in Chinese history. However, upon careful examination, the style of subjectivism and dogmatism still exists quite seriously in the research work of historical science. Some historians have not yet "possessed the materials in detail," and cannot, under the theoretical guidance of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, carefully analyze a large number of objective historical facts, so as to draw correct conclusions. On the contrary, they often start from certain sentences in the classic works of Marxism-Leninism, and fabricate some theories based on their own subjective imagination, and then piece together and one-sidedly extract some historical materials to prove their pre-arranged conclusions. This phenomenon can often be found in the debate on the periodization of ancient Chinese society, in the debate on the formation of nationalities, and in the debate on the budding of capitalism. If this continues, it will only create greater confusion and will not lead to a real solution to the problem. In a few historians, there is also a trivial style of "seeing trees but not the forest." This one-sided and fragmented research method cannot find the internal connection of objective historical facts from complex and intricate historical phenomena, and cannot discover the objective laws existing in historical phenomena. This unhealthy phenomenon should be overcome.

    We should treat our historical science research work with a scientific, realistic, and truth-seeking attitude, a Marxist-Leninist attitude, and overcome the subjective and dogmatic attitudes that are harmful to the development of historical science.

    In the article "Reform Our Study," Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly pointed out that we should attach importance to the history of our motherland and seriously study the history of our motherland; and criticized the phenomenon of "knowing little or nothing about one's own history." He particularly pointed out that we should seriously study "the history of the Chinese Communist Party and the history of China in the past century since the Opium War," and pointed out that "we should gather talents and cooperate in a division of labor to do it, and overcome the state of disorganization." Fifteen years ago, even in the most difficult stage of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us in this way.

    Fifteen years have passed, and the revolutionary cause has achieved victory under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong. The People's Republic of China has been born for six years and has created unprecedentedly favorable conditions for historical workers. However, examining the state of progress of historical science, it must be said that it is very unsatisfactory. Up to now, our historians have not yet seriously compiled textbooks on the history of the motherland on the basis of the existing scientific level; the in-depth scientific research work on the ancient history and the recent hundred years of history of our country has not really begun; many important issues in Chinese history are still stagnant in a vague stage; a large number of precious archaeological and archival historical materials have not yet been preliminarily sorted out, let alone fully used; the survey and research work of ethnology has not yet been seriously launched; all these fully prove that there are extremely serious backward phenomena in our historical research work.

    From the perspective of the organizational work of historical science, although some institutions for studying history have been established in the Academy of Sciences, and most comprehensive universities and normal colleges have also set up history departments and many teaching and research offices. However, basically, they are still doing their own thing, and it cannot be said that they are working in an organized manner. For decades, our country has been in a semi-colonial state for a long time, and has been in a state of war for a long time. The development of history has encountered great misfortune, and therefore the foundation is very weak and the manpower is very insufficient. In recent years, the phenomenon of using talents in areas other than their specialties is quite serious in the historical field. For example, the study of Mongolian history is quite difficult, and it requires a multi-faceted language foundation to carry out in-depth scientific research. As far as we know, the few Mongolian historians in our country have either changed careers or are using their talents in areas other than their specialties, which has wasted the foundation laid down over the years, let alone using their expertise to train the next generation. Historical geography is an extremely important link in historical research, and it requires long-term accumulation to sort out a clue from the messy materials. There are originally very few specialized talents in our country in this regard, but the few scholars who do exist cannot devote themselves to this work. Here, I am only giving two examples, and similar unreasonable phenomena are not individual, and should attract our attention.

    If we want to make historical science develop healthily, we must fundamentally establish a solid foundation for this discipline, and we must make necessary and appropriate adjustments in terms of manpower on a national scale.

    From the perspective of free debate on important historical issues in our country and criticism and self-criticism in academics, although preliminary development has been made in recent years, it cannot be said to be very healthy. A historian, in his diligent research, discovers the objective laws of a certain historical phenomenon, and thus forms his own set of theories, and he has the obligation to do his best to maintain his theory. However, historical phenomena are complex and diverse, and it is very likely that he overemphasizes individual or partial phenomena, thus making his theory somewhat biased. When other historical workers put forward different views and conduct debates, he should regard it as helpful assistance to himself, and should not regard it as an attack on himself, and thus feel dissatisfied and create some artificial barriers emotionally; still less should he regard himself as an authority and arrogantly strike at those who put forward different opinions. As long as his theory is indeed built on a solid foundation of scientific research, it will not be harmed by the presentation of different opinions. If the basis of his theory is indeed not sufficient, and after discussion, the shortcomings and even errors are discovered, it will be revised and gradually make the problem be solved. When carrying out academic criticism, we should adopt a method of reasoning, and we should analyze and study the key to the shortcomings or errors of a certain theory with reasons and evidence, instead of adopting a simple method, putting on a few hats that are difficult for people to accept, and considering the matter settled. Academic research is a meticulous work, and criticizing any theory or doctrine requires careful scientific analysis, full research from the theoretical and historical basis, and accurate identification of the key to why it is wrong, in order to have persuasive power. The method of simply dismissing it with one stroke cannot solve the problem.

    In short, for the sake of truth, criticism is very necessary, and counter-criticism is equally necessary. Without academic criticism and counter-criticism, without free academic debate, historical science cannot develop normally and will stop.

    Recently, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" in academics, which is very timely and very important. This policy has greatly encouraged historians. Under this policy, the enthusiasm and creativity of historians will be more fully utilized, and the historical science of our country will be rapidly developed.

    The long-term plan for historical science is currently being formulated, and after repeated discussions among historians across the country, this plan will be more practical. With a practical long-term goal and specific steps for advancement, under the guidance of correct policies and policies, historical science workers will certainly be able to complete the glorious tasks given by the country.

    Since Comrade Mao Zedong published "Reform Our Study," he has been very concerned about the development of historical science in our country in the past fifteen years; the Party and the government have created unprecedentedly favorable conditions for historical research in our country. We believe that the comrades in the historical field will make full use of these conditions to work hard and move forward.

    In the future, in order to carry out work in a more organized and planned way, we should take the following necessary measures:

    Compiling a Chinese history textbook with considerable weight should be the urgent task of current historians. Up to now, our broad masses of cadres still do not know much about the ancient and modern history of China, and there are many difficulties in the history teaching in universities, middle schools and primary schools. It should be the responsibility of historians across the country to change this situation.

    Some people say: "Many major historical issues have not been resolved, and it is impossible to compile textbooks." This idea is wrong. Resolving some major historical issues is the long-term work of historians, and we cannot delay the compilation of textbooks because of this. According to the existing achievements of historical research, it is not only necessary but also possible to compile them as soon as possible. Moreover, the so-called solution of the problem can only have relative significance; the research of major historical problems often changes with the discovery of new historical materials, and it is always developing in an increasingly enriched, enriched, and perfected way. Waiting for a long time is tantamount to canceling the compilation of textbooks.

    Some people say: "Compiling history according to the views of any one school will hinder the development of historical science." This statement is unfounded. Compiling textbooks always has to be based on the views of a school of thought. However, this is by no means equivalent to "exalting one theory alone" and abandoning other theories. Moreover, textbooks are by no means fixed editions that "will not change for hundreds of generations." They will inevitably be revised frequently according to the development of historical science, so as to be rewritten. Academic issues should adopt the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." This is by no means stopping discussion and stopping "contending." On the contrary, other theories can completely compile history according to their own systems. Different opinions should be seriously debated freely in academics, which will only promote the development of academics, and it is impossible to hinder its progress due to the compilation of textbooks.

    In short, it is very necessary for historians to concentrate some strength and seriously compile a Chinese history textbook. Ignoring this comprehensive work will delay the development of historical science.

    There are many important issues in historical science in our country that have been debated for a long time and have not been fundamentally resolved. For example, the issue of periodization of ancient Chinese society, the issue of the budding of Chinese capitalism, the issue of the formation of Chinese nationalities, the issue of periodization of modern Chinese history, etc., are still each affirming their own views and denying those of others, forming a stalemate situation. The development of this debate is a good phenomenon in the historical field of our country, and it must be continued in the future, so that various different opinions can be freely expressed, and the crux of the problem can be gradually clarified, and basically convincing conclusions can be drawn. We believe that in order to further deepen these issues, scholars who adhere to various different opinions must put in more effort. For example, the issue of periodization of ancient Chinese society involves extremely broad aspects, and from theory to historical materials, we must break through past limitations. In addition to further collecting and studying documentary materials, we must also expand the scope of historical materials and seriously study the discoveries in archeology and the materials obtained in ethnological surveys. Only on the basis of a large amount of actual materials from all aspects, after careful analysis and synthesis, can we go deeper and sort out a clue to the problem. Another example is the issue of the budding of Chinese capitalism. Only by deeply studying the specific economic conditions developing within feudal society, collecting specific materials from all aspects, and analyzing them, can we draw a conclusion.

    In short, academic debates based on realistic and truth-seeking scientific research will be an important guarantee for promoting the rapid development of historical science. We advocate a practical and simple style of study, and oppose a flamboyant style of study, so that the phenomenon of "heavy head, light feet, and shallow foundation" will not occur.

    The collection, preservation, sorting, compilation, and publication of historical materials are important steps in the development of historical science, and we must attach great importance to them. The research work of the recent hundred years of history will encounter great difficulties if it is separated from the archives of the past hundred years. However, a large number of archives are piled up there, and even the preliminary sorting has not been seriously started. A large number of documentary materials, archaeological materials, etc. related to ancient Chinese history and medieval history have also not been scientifically sorted and compiled, which makes the research work in this area extremely difficult. These phenomena are extremely abnormal and must be organized as soon as possible to carry out the work; delaying it will cause great losses. Comrade Mao Zedong believes that "there is no right to speak without investigation," and wants us to "possess the materials in detail"; as historical workers, it is absolutely not allowed to take an indifferent attitude towards historical materials.

    Historical science, like other disciplines, has already possessed favorable conditions for full development, and the biggest difficulty is the shortage of manpower. However, the development of socialist construction is very fast, and all walks of life will increasingly feel the shortage of manpower, so it is useless to wait passively. The problem is how to give full play to the potential strength of existing historians, organize them, and actively cultivate a large number of new forces in the practice of scientific research. This requires focusing on the long-term development of the entire historical science, and organizing and adjusting them according to the specialties of existing historians, so that they can be in their respective positions; at the same time, equip them with necessary assistants, so that the accumulated knowledge can be further developed, and make it possible for them to pass on their expertise to the next generation as soon as possible. Only in this way can the difficulty of insufficient manpower be gradually solved.

    Comrade Mao Zedong taught us fifteen years ago that we must attach importance to the history of our motherland and seriously study the history of our motherland. We should cherish this instruction and truly implement this instruction into historical science work to promote the development of historical science.

    改进历史科学的研究工作
    ——为毛泽东同志发表“改造我们的学习”十五周年纪念而作
    中国科学院哲学社会科学学部委员　尹达
    1941年的5月，毛泽东同志在延安干部会议上作了“改造我们的学习”的报告，这是十五年前整风运动的开端。1942年2月间，毛泽东同志又作了“整顿党的作风”和“反对党八股”两个报告。这三篇文章是整风运动中的基本文件。在这些文章中，对主观主义、宗派主义和教条主义的倾向给以有力的批判。广大干部经过一再深入的学习，在思想上是大大的提高了，党也空前地团结了。
    毛泽东同志在这篇文章里，对于我国历史科学的研究工作提出了极其宝贵的意见。十五年前所提出的这些意见，对于今天我们历史科学的现状来说，依然是极其恰当的。根据毛泽东同志的这些指示，来检查当前的历史科学的工作，应当说是十分必要的。
    毛泽东同志在这篇文章里，指出了主观主义和教条主义对革命的危害，对科学理论的危害；要我们从马克思列宁主义的理论里找立场、找观点、找方法，去科学地分析客观存在的实际事物，加以综合研究，从那里发现它们相互间的内在联系，发现它们的规律。要我们以实事求是的态度对待理论的研究。毛泽东同志说“实事”就是客观存在着的一切事物，“是”就是客观事物的内部联系，即规律性，“求”就是我们去研究。这种实事求是的作风，也正是理论同实际统一的作风。
    “改造我们的学习”已经发表十五年了。在这十五年里，我们历史科学工作虽说也得到某些成绩，有了一定的进展；特别是近几年来，对于我国历史上的某些重要问题也初步展开了理论上的争论，大多数的史学家开始在运用马克思列宁主义探究我国历史上的某些重要问题。但是，认真检查起来，在历史科学的研究工作中，主观主义和教条主义的作风还是相当严重地存在着的。部分史学家还没有“详细地占有材料”，还不能在辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的理论指导下，认真分析大量的客观史实，从而引出正确的结论。相反的，往往是从马克思列宁主义的经典著作中的某些辞句出发，凭自己的主观想像臆造出某种理论，然后东拼西凑，片面地摘引某些史料，以证实其早已安排好的结论。这种现象在我国的古代社会分期问题的争论里，在民族形成问题的争论里，在资本主义萌芽问题的争论里，往往可以发现。这样下去，只会造成更大的混乱，却不可能导致问题的真正解决。在少数史学家中，还存在着“只见树木不见森林”的烦琐作风，这种片面的支离破碎的治学方法，不可能从复杂错综的历史现象中找出客观史实的内在联系，不可能发现历史现象中所存在着的客观规律。这种不健康的现象，应当加以克服。
    我们应当以科学的实事求是的态度，马克思列宁主义的态度，对待我们的历史科学的研究工作，克服有害于历史科学发展的主观主义的教条主义的态度。
    毛泽东同志在“改造我们的学习”这篇文章里，一再指出要我们重视祖国的历史，认真研究祖国的历史；并且批评了“对于自己的历史一点不懂，或懂得甚少”的现象。特别指出要认真研究“中国共产党的历史和鸦片战争以来的中国近百年史”，并且指出“应聚集人材，分工合作地去做，克服无组织的状态”。十五年前，还在抗日战争的最困难的阶段，毛泽东同志就是这样指示我们的。
    十五年的时间过去了，革命事业在党中央和毛泽东同志的正确领导下，已经取得了胜利。中华人民共和国业已诞生六年了，并且为历史工作者创造了空前有利的条件。但是，检查一下历史科学进展的状况，应当说是十分不能令人满意的。到现在为止，我们的史学家们还没有在现有科学水平的基础上认真编出祖国历史的教科书；关于我国古代的历史和近百年的历史，都还没有真正开始深入的科学研究工作；我国历史上的许多重要问题，都还停滞在若明若暗的阶段；大量珍贵的考古及档案的历史资料，都还没有得到初步的整理，更谈不到充分的使用了；民族学的调查研究工作还没有认真展开；诸如此类，都充分证明我们的历史研究工作还存在着极其严重的落后现象。
    从历史科学的组织工作上看，虽说在科学院已成立了一些研究历史的机构，在综合大学和师范学院里，大都也设了历史系和不少的教研室。但是，基本上还是各自为政，还不能说是有组织地在进行工作。几十年来，我国长期处于半殖民地的状态中，长期处于战争的状态中，历史学的发展遭遇到极大的厄运，因之，基础也就十分薄弱，人力十分不足。近几年来，在人力的使用上，用非所学的现象，在史学界中是相当严重的。举例来说，蒙古史的研究是相当困难的，要有多方面的语文基础才能够进行深入的科学研究工作。据我们所知，我国仅有的几位蒙古史学者，或者改行了，或者是用非所学，这就把多年来打下的基础白白荒废了，更谈不到用他们的专长去培养下一代。历史地理是历史研究中极其重要的一个环节，需要长期的积累，才能够从杂乱不堪的资料中理出一个眉目来。我国在这方面的专门人材本来很少，而仅有的几位学者，却都不可能专心致志从事这一工作。在这里，我只是举出两个例子而已，类似这样不合理的现象，并不是个别的，应当引起我们的重视。
    如果要使历史科学健康地发展，就必须从根本上为这门学科建立巩固的基础，就必须在全国范围内从人力方面作必要的应有的调整。
    从我国重要历史问题的自由争论上以及学术中的批评和自我批评上看，近几年来虽说已有初步开展，但是绝不能说已经十分健康了。一个史学家在辛勤的钻研中，发现某一历史现象的客观规律，因而形成自己的一套理论，他有义务尽力维护自己的理论。但是，历史的现象是复杂多端的，自己很可能过分强调了个别的或局部的现象，因而使自己的理论有所偏颇。其他历史工作者提出不同的看法，进行争辩，他就应当认为是对自己有益的帮助，不应该看做是对自己的攻击，因而心怀不满，从感情上制造某种人为的隔阂；更不应该以权威自居，盛气凌人地给提出不同意见的人以打击。只要自己的理论确实是建筑在巩固的科学研究的基础上，那就不会因为不同意见的提出受到损害。假如自己的理论根据确实不够充分，经过讨论，发现其中的缺点以至错误，就会得到修改，逐渐使问题获得解决。在开展学术上的批评的时候，我们应当是采取说理的方式，应当是有根有据地去分析研究某一理论的缺点或错误的关键，而不应采取简单的方式，戴上几个使人难以接受的帽子，就算了事。学术研究是一件细致的工作，批评任何一种理论或学说，都需要进行认真的科学分析，从理论上以及史实的根据上进行充分的研究，确切地找出其所以不对的关键所在，才能够具有说服力量。简单地一笔抹煞的办法是解决不了问题的。
    总之，为了真理，批评是十分必要的，反批评也是同样必要的。没有学术上的批评和反批评，没有学术上的自由争论，历史科学就不可能得到正常的发展，就会停止下来。
    最近，党中央和毛泽东同志提出在学术上的“百家争鸣”的方针，是十分及时，十分重要的。这一方针给史学家以极大的鼓舞。在这一方针下，将更能够充分发挥史学家的积极性和创造性，使我国的历史科学得到迅速的发展。
    目前正在制定历史科学的远景规划，经过全国史学家反复讨论，这个规划将会更加切合实际。有了合于实际的长远目标，有了前进的具体步骤，在正确方针政策的指导下，历史科学工作者一定能够完成国家所给予的光荣任务。
    毛泽东同志从“改造我们的学习”发表以来，在这十五年内，一直十分关怀我国历史科学的发展；党和政府并为我国的历史研究工作创设了空前有利的条件。我们相信，史学界的同志们是会充分运用这些条件努力前进的。
    今后为了更加有组织有计划地开展工作，我们应当采取以下的必要措施：
    编写有相当分量的中国历史教科书，应当是当前史学家的迫切任务。到现在为止，我们的广大干部对中国古代的和近代的历史还是不甚了然的，在大学、中学和小学的历史教学中困难是很多的。改变这种情况，应当是全国史学家的责任。
    有人说：“许多历史上的重大问题还没有解决，不可能编写教科书”。这种想法是不对的。解决历史上的某些重大问题，是史学家长期的工作，我们不能因此就拖延教科书的编写。根据现有的历史研究的成果，及早编写不仅是十分必要的，而且也是可能的。况且，所谓问题的解决，也只能有相对的意义；历史上重大问题的研究，往往随着新的史料的发现，有所变化，总是在日益充实，日益丰富，日益完备地发展着。长期等待，就等于取消教科书的编写工作。
    有人说：“根据任何一派的说法编写历史，都会阻碍历史科学的发展”。这种说法是没有根据的。编写教科书总是要根据一种学派的说法的。但是，这绝不等于“独尊一说”，废弃其他说法。并且，教科书绝不是“百世不移”的定本，它必然会根据历史科学的发展经常加以修改，以致于重新编写。学术性质的问题，应当采取“百家争鸣”的方针，这绝不是停止讨论，停止“争鸣”，相反的，其他的说法完全可以根据自己的体系编写历史。不同的意见，应当认真展开学术上的自由争辩，这只会推动学术的发展，不可能因为教科书的编写阻碍了它的前进。
    总之，历史学家集中一定力量，认真编写出一部中国历史教科书来，是十分必要的。忽视这种综合性质的工作就会延缓历史科学的发展。
    我国历史科学中有不少重要的问题，长期争论，未能获得基本解决。如中国古代社会的分期问题，中国资本主义的萌芽问题，中国民族的形成问题，中国近代史的分期问题等等，到目前为止，依然是各是其是，各非其非，形成相持的局面。这种争论的开展，是我国史学界的好现象，今后一定要继续下去，以使各种不同的意见都能够畅所欲言，逐步弄清问题的症结所在，得出基本上令人信服的结论。我们认为，要使这些问题深入一步，坚持各种不同意见的学者都要付出更大劳力才有可能。如中国古代社会的分期问题，关涉的方面极广，从理论到史料都必须突破过去的局限。除进一步搜集研究文献资料外，还须扩大史料的范围，认真研究考古学上的发现以及民族学调查中所得到的资料。只有根据各方面的大量实际资料，经过认真的分析和综合工作，才能够深入下去，把问题理出一个眉目来。又如中国资本主义的萌芽问题，同样只有深入钻研在封建社会内部发展着的具体的经济状况，从各个方面搜集具体资料，加以分析，才能够得出结果来。
    总之，建筑在实事求是的科学研究基础上的学术争论，将是推动历史科学迅速发展的重要保证。我们提倡切实朴素的学风，反对浮夸的学风，这就不会发生“头重脚轻根底浅”的现象了。
    历史资料的搜集、保管、整理、编纂和出版，是发展历史科学的重要步骤，我们必须十分重视。近百年史的研究工作，如果脱离了百年来的档案，就会发生极大困难。但是，大量的档案却积压在那里，连初步的整理都还没有认真动手。有关我国古代史和中古史的大量文献资料，考古的资料等，也大都还没有经过科学的整理和编纂，这就使得这方面的研究工作，产生极大困难。这些现象是极不正常的，必须及早组织人力，进行工作；拖延下去，就会造成很大的损失。毛泽东同志认为“没有调查就没有发言权”，并要我们“详细地占有材料”；作为史学工作者，对于历史资料采取漠不关心的态度，是绝不容许的。
    历史科学和其它学科一样，已经具备了充分发展的有利条件，最大的困难就是人力不足。但是，社会主义建设事业的发展是很快的，各行各业都会日益感到人力不足，因此，消极等待是无用的。问题只是在于如何充分发挥现有史学家的潜在的力量，组织起来，在科学研究的实践中，积极培养大批新生力量。这就必须从整个历史科学发展的远景着眼，根据现有史学家的特长，加以组织调整，使他们各得其所；同时为他们配备必要的助手，使长期积累起来的学识得到进一步的发展，使他们有可能把他们的专长及早传给下一代。只有这样，才能逐渐解决人力不足的困难。
    毛泽东同志在十五年前教导我们必须重视祖国的历史，认真研究祖国的历史。我们应当珍视这一指示，并把这一指示真正贯彻到历史科学工作中去，来推进历史科学的发展。
