    Helping Farmers Master Technology
    After the great development of the agricultural cooperation movement, the scope of technical guidance work undertaken by many agricultural technology extension stations has greatly expanded. How to impart new production technologies to the vast number of farmers and help them achieve their demands for improving technology and increasing production is a new problem that urgently needs to be resolved in the work of technology extension stations.
    In this year's spring plowing, the Zhengjia Agricultural Technology Extension Station in Baicheng County, Jilin Province, changed its past piecemeal working methods and boldly handed over technology to the masses, achieving good results. The technology extension station divided the entire district into three areas and established technology teaching stations at the central location of each area to help cooperatives establish technical night schools on a production team basis. About ten days before each operation, the extension station gathered the night school teachers (who are the leaders of the production team's technical research group) to the teaching station to impart the technology urgently needed at the time. After returning to the team, the teachers used the evenings to teach the technology to the members. Before the start of spring plowing, the teaching station had universally imparted the techniques of soil preparation and moisture conservation, spring plowing, seed treatment, and the sowing of major crops. This method of technology transfer, where learning is followed by immediate practice, has been welcomed by the vast number of members, who say: Learning this way makes it easier to remember, and you can start doing it as soon as you get back.

    帮助农民掌握技术
    在农业合作化运动大发展以后，许多农业技术推广站负责技术指导工作的范围大大地扩大了。如何把新的生产技术交给广大农民，帮助农民实现改进技术、增加生产的要求，是技术推广站工作中急需解决的新问题。
    吉林省白城县郑家农业技术推广站在今年的春耕过程中，改变了过去的小手小脚的工作方法，大胆地把技术交给群众，取得了良好的成绩。技术推广站把全区划分为三个片，在每片的中心地点设立技术传授站，帮助合作社以生产队为单位建立技术夜校。推广站在每项作业前十天左右，分片把夜校教员（由生产队的技术研究小组组长担任）召集到传授站，传授当前迫切需要的技术，教员回队后利用晚间把技术教给社员。在春耕开始前，传授站已经把整地保墒、春翻、种子处理和主要农作物播种技术普遍传授完了。这种随学随做的技术传授方法，受到了广大社员的欢迎，他们说：这样学记的扎实，回去伸手就能搞。
