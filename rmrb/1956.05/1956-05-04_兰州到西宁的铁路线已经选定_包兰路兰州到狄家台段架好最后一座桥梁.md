　　Lanzhou to Xining Railway Line Selected
    Last Bridge Erected on Baolan Railway's Lanzhou to Dijiatai Section
    The survey work for the Lanzhou-Xining section of the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway has been completed. Railway surveyors are now organizing various survey data in preparation for design. Construction on the 176-kilometer section from Lanzhou to Xining will begin in the fourth quarter of this year.
    During the surveying of the Lanzhou to Xining line, Soviet experts went deep into the field and put forward major suggestions for improving the line, which reduced the number of tunnels by several and reduced the relocation of highway projects by six and a half kilometers compared with the originally selected line. Soviet experts also suggested that a section of the line near Hongzhuang be relocated to the north of the Huangshui River, thus avoiding the serious threat of mudslides and debris flows to the line. According to preliminary calculations, the line selected with the help of Soviet experts can save more than one million yuan in project investment compared with the originally selected line, and the quality of the line can be greatly improved.
    The main bridge project of this section of the railway has been fully completed after the last bridge – the Dalanggou Bridge on the Lanzhou to Dijiatai section of the Baolan Railway – was completed on April 29. Now, the road construction workers are stepping up the construction of auxiliary projects such as the bridgehead earthwork, preparing to start laying tracks northward from Lanzhou in mid-May. The workers also guarantee that they will complete the tasks stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in August this year. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

　　兰州到西宁的铁路线已经选定
    包兰路兰州到狄家台段架好最后一座桥梁
    兰州—青海铁路兰州西宁段的定测工作完成。现在，铁路勘测人员正在整理各种勘测资料，准备进行设计。今年第四季度，从兰州到西宁176公里的一段，就要动工修筑了。
    在勘测兰州到西宁线路的时候，苏联专家曾经深入现场，提出了改善线路的重大建议，使最后选定的线路比原来选定的线路减少了好几座隧道，并且减少了六公里半的改移公路工程。苏联专家还建议把洪庄附近的一段线路改移到湟水以北，这样就避免了流泥流石对线路的严重威胁。据初步计算，在苏联专家帮助之下选定的线路，可以比原来选择的线路节省工程投资一百余万元，而且线路质量可以大大提高。
    包兰铁路兰州到狄家台段的最后一座桥梁——打狼沟大桥在四月二十九日完工以后，这一段铁路的桥涵主体工程已经全部完工了。现在，筑路职工正在加紧修筑桥头土方等附属工程，准备在五月中旬从兰州开始向北铺轨。职工们并提出保证，要在今年八月提前完成第一个五年计划规定的任务。　　　（据新华社讯）
