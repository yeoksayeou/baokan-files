Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 11th: Mrs. P.P. Devi, President of the Nepalese Women's Federation, presented a letter from Nepalese Prime Minister Acharya to Soong Ching Ling this afternoon. The full text of the letter is as follows: Dear Madame Sun:
    It is with pleasure that I inform you that three or four Nepalese women, including Mrs. P.P. Devi, are attending the meeting of the Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation in Beijing. The heroic struggle of Chinese women for the cause of revolution has inspired us. Women around the world are increasingly concerned about human progress and the struggle of women to liberate themselves from long-term bondage. After a century of separation, Nepal has recently entered the international political arena. I believe that the recent establishment of diplomatic relations between Nepal and China will help achieve our ideal of a guaranteed life, freedom, and the happiness of people all over the world, especially in those backward countries.
    I believe Nepalese women will be well taken care of in your hospitable country. I hope that when they return home, they will bring back not only pleasant memories of visiting China, but also the revolutionary urgency and enthusiasm that inspires the women of your great country. I would be greatly honored if you would accept a blanket and a pair of Nepalese shoes from my wife and myself.
    With best wishes and regards.
    Yours sincerely, Tanka Prasad Acharya
            April 17, 1956

    尼泊尔首相写信给宋庆龄
    德维夫人代表尼泊尔首相向宋庆龄赠礼
    新华社上海11日电　尼泊尔妇女联合会主席普·普·德维夫人今天下午将尼泊尔首相阿查里雅的一封信交给了宋庆龄。信的全文如下：亲爱的孙夫人：
    我以愉快的心情告诉您，有三、四位尼泊尔妇女来到北京参加国际民主妇女联合会理事会会议，其中包括普·普·德维夫人。中国妇女为了革命事业所作的英勇斗争鼓舞了我们。全世界妇女日益关怀人类的进步和妇女把自己从长期的束缚中解放出来的斗争。经过了一世纪的隔阂，尼泊尔最近已登上了国际政治舞台。我相信，最近尼泊尔和中国之间建立的外交关系，将有助于取得我们理想的、有保证的生活，自由，和全世界人民的幸福，特别有助于那些落后国家。
    我相信尼泊尔妇女在你们好客的国家里会得到很好的照顾。我希望她们回国后，不仅将带回访问中国的愉快记忆，同时也将带回鼓舞着你们伟大国家的妇女的那种革命的迫切要求和热情。请接受我和我的夫人送您的一条毛毯和一双尼泊尔鞋子，我将感到十分荣幸。
    致以最良好的愿望和关怀。
    你的诚挚的坦卡·普拉萨德·阿查里雅
