    Zhao Jimin and the "May Fourth" Fine Wheat Variety
    Zhang Bifu
    Zhao Jimin, a technician at the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Comprehensive Experiment Station, used the asexual hybridization method of wheat seed embryo grafting based on the Michurin theory to breed the "May Fourth" fine wheat variety. After identification, it was proven to have thick and strong stalks, strong fertilizer resistance, uniform growth, multiple flowers and grains, and resistance to stripe rust and wheat black powder disease. In small field trials, the yield was more than 13% higher than the "Bima No. 1" fine wheat variety. The breeding of a wheat variety with productive value using asexual hybridization is a first in our country. It shows that agricultural scientists in our country have taken another step forward in learning Michurin's biological science.
    In the spring of 1951, Zhao Jimin came to the Mei County Agricultural School to teach. At that time, the school assigned him to teach the Michurin genetics and breeding course. He felt that he had no experience and was hesitant to teach this course. Later, encouraged by school leaders, he was determined to learn and teach at the same time. The students' serious learning spirit constantly encouraged his teaching confidence. Soon, he became very passionate about teaching breeding courses. It was because of this that he had the idea of using asexual hybridization to breed seeds.
    The First Experiment
    One quiet night that summer, when people were already asleep, Zhao Jimin was pondering the following questions: According to the Michurin theory, fine varieties can be selected through sexual or asexual hybridization, but the hybrid plant varieties we commonly see are very few. Except for berries and the like, no one has used asexual hybridization to breed fine varieties of wheat and cotton. The students also hoped to see with their own eyes a wheat variety produced by asexual hybridization. Therefore, he thought: why can't I make one as an example? After thinking about this for a long time, he finally decided to cooperate with the teaching practice and lead the students to do an experiment.
    That autumn, before the wheat was sown, the students of the 54th grade of the Mei County Agricultural School, under the leadership of Zhao Jimin, used the method of wheat seed embryo grafting to transplant many wheat grains and sow them in the soil. In the spring of the following year, the wheat flowered and bore fruit, but after careful observation, the wheat that grew was the same as the original parent, without any variation. Their experiment failed. Some students doubted the method of using asexual grafting to breed wheat seeds. As for Zhao Jimin? He felt even more distressed. He was afraid that the students would not trust him, and it would be more difficult to teach the class in the future. Some people with conservative ideas also made strange remarks to ridicule him. Zhao Jimin, who usually loved to talk and laugh, became taciturn. He was unwilling to accept his failure, but he did not have the courage to continue the experiment.
    Learning from Failure
    Just when Zhao Jimin was in distress, the school leaders talked to him several times, supporting him to continue the experiment. The principal said to him: "With Michurin's scientific theory as support, what are you afraid of? The important thing is to sum up the lessons of failure." These few conversations encouraged Zhao Jimin's fighting spirit. He searched for information about asexual hybridization breeding from all aspects and studied it. In his studies, he discovered many reasons for his failure.
    Hybridization must be carried out purposefully and planned. According to Michurin's steps for creating new varieties, this work is usually carried out repeatedly in three aspects: selection, hybridization, and directional cultivation. However, this experiment of theirs was very blind. They neither selected good parents nor cultivated them well after sowing. The cutting of the embryo was also very rough (some students used thumbtacks ground into blades). Zhao Jimin guided the students to carefully summarize the lessons of failure, regroup, and prepare for the second experiment. During the summer vacation, he went to the teacher's study meeting to participate in learning, and he also carried wheat in his pocket, practicing the embryo cutting technique whenever he had time.
    In the spring of 1952, there was rain and flooding in Guanzhong, Shaanxi, and many strong wheat fields were lodged. The wheat in the Mei County area suffered serious damage from wheat sucking insects. The hard work of the farmers throughout the year was mostly lost. Seeing these things, Zhao Jimin thought: How valuable it would be if we could select a wheat variety that is suitable for cultivation in fertile soil and resistant to wheat sucking insects through experiments! This is also a glorious task entrusted to agricultural scientists by the Party and government leaders of Shaanxi Province.
    The "May Fourth" Wheat Was Born
    In the autumn of 1952, Zhao Jimin led the students of the 54th grade and began the second experiment. They selected the "Northwest 302" and "Northwest Station No. 2" wheat varieties, which had strong production capacity that year, and still used the wet grafting method to cut off the embryo of the "Northwest 302" wheat and graft it onto the endosperm of the "Northwest Station No. 2". A total of more than 300 grains were transplanted and sparsely planted on a very fertile land, and managed and cultivated meticulously like a loving mother nurturing an infant. In the spring of the second year, the grafted wheat flowered and eared. Among them, three plants mutated, with the shape of "Northwest Station No. 2". In particular, one of the three plants was short in stature and had thick and strong stalks, with eight tillers, and produced 813 seeds. This was the later "May Fourth" fine variety. Zhao Jimin carefully collected it as a single plant and prepared to plant it for trial next year.
    During the summer vacation of 1953, Zhao Jimin participated in the Michurin crop breeding training class held by the former Northwest Agricultural and Forestry Bureau, and systematically studied Michurin's scientific theory. In the autumn of that year, he and the students selected the grains of this wheat and planted the second generation. The growth process of these seeds was uniform, without separation, and had good agronomic traits. They harvested eight and a half catties of seeds on an area of ​​one cent of land. An average of more than ninety grains were produced per ear. When the wheat was about to be harvested, many strong wheat fields in the local area were lodged, but this small plot of wheat remained the same. The victory gave Zhao Jimin and the students of the 54th grade a great encouragement.
    At this time, it was the summer of 1954, and time gave this wheat a name - "May Fourth" wheat. At the same time, the students of the 54th grade of Mei County Agricultural School contributed a lot to the birth of "May Fourth", and the name "May Fourth" has a double commemorative meaning.
    In 1954, as soon as the "May Fourth" wheat was born, it aroused the concern of the Party and government leading organs and scientific circles of Shaanxi Province. That summer, the Provincial Department of Agriculture transferred Zhao Jimin to work at the Provincial Agricultural Comprehensive Experiment Station. This is an organization specializing in agricultural scientific experiments and research, and the experimental conditions are much better than when he was at school. The comrades at the station helped him summarize the experimental experience, and under the leadership of the Department of Agriculture, they continued to appraise the variety on the one hand, and carried out demonstration and propagation on the other. Now, the "May Fourth" wheat has only been born for two years, and there are already six places in Shaanxi conducting regional demonstrations.

    赵济民和“五四号”小麦良种
    张毕夫
    陕西省农业综合试验站技术员赵济民，运用米丘林学说用小麦种胚嫁接的无性杂交方法选育出了“五四号”小麦良种。经过鉴定，证明它茎秆粗硬，耐肥力强，生长整齐，多花多粒，且能抗条锈病和秆黑粉病；在小田试验中，产量还高出“碧蚂一号”小麦良种13％以上。运用无性杂交方法选育出一个有生产价值的小麦良种，在我国还是第一次。它显示出了我国农业科学工作者们在学习米丘林生物科学的道路上，又前进了一步。
    1951年春，赵济民来到郿县农业学校教书，当时，学校派他担任米丘林遗传育种课程，他觉得自己没有经验，对教这门课很胆怯。以后在学校领导人员鼓励下，他才下定决心，边学边教。同学们认真学习的精神，时时鼓舞着他的教学信心。不久，他就非常热爱教授育种课程了。正因为这样，他才有了用无性杂交选育种子的念头。
    第一次试验
    这年夏天，在一个寂静的深夜里，人们已经熟睡了，赵济民却在捉摸着这样的问题：按照米丘林学说，通过有性杂交或无性杂交，都可以选育出良种来，但是我们所常见到的杂交植物品种很少，除浆果之类外，麦、棉作物没有人用无性杂交选育出良种。学生们也希望能亲眼看到一个无性杂交所产生的麦种。因此，他想：自己为什么不能做一个样子出来呢？这样想了好长时间，终于决定配合教学实习，领导同学们做一次试验。
    当年秋天，麦子下种前，郿县农校五四级的学生，在赵济民的领导下，用小麦种胚嫁接的方法，移接了许多麦粒，下种在土里。第二年春季，麦子扬花结实了，可是，经过仔细观察，所成长起来的麦子，和原来的亲本一样，没有一株变异。他们的试验失败了。有些学生对于用无性嫁接的方法选育麦种，发生了怀疑。赵济民呢？内心更苦，一怕学生们对他不信任，以后的课再难教下去；有一些有保守思想的人，还说各种怪话来讥笑他。平常爱说爱笑的赵济民，变得沉默寡言了。他既不甘心自己的失败，却又无勇气继续试验下去。
    从失败中吸取教训
    赵济民正在苦闷的时候，学校领导人员找他几次谈话，支持他继续试验下去。校长向他说：“有米丘林的科学理论撑腰，怕什么？重要的问题在于好好总结失败的教训。”这几句谈话，鼓舞了赵济民的斗争精神。他从各方面寻找有关无性杂交育种资料学习，在学习中，他发现了自己失败的许多原因。
    杂交必须是有目的、有计划地进行。根据米丘林创造新品种的步骤，这一工作通常分为选择、杂交、定向培育三方面顺序反复来进行。可是他们这一次试验，盲目性很大，既没有选择好亲本，下种后也没有好好培育，切胚的时候又很粗糙（有的学生曾用大头针碾成刀片来用）。赵济民引导学生认真总结了失败的教训，重整旗鼓，准备第二次试验。放暑假时候，他去教师学习会参加学习，口袋里也装着麦子，一有空就练习着切胚技术。
    1952年春季，陕西关中雨涝，许多壮地的小麦倒伏了，郿县一带的小麦又遭受吸浆虫严重为害，农民们终年辛苦的成果，损失大半。赵济民看到这些事情，就想：如果我们通过试验，能够选育出一个既适合肥沃土壤栽培、又能抗吸浆虫的小麦品种，该是多么有价值啊！这也正是陕西省党政领导机关交给农业科学工作者的一项光荣任务。
    “五四号”小麦出生了
    1952年秋天，赵济民领导五四级的学生，开始了第二次试验。他们选择了当年丰产力强的“西北三○二号”和“西北站二号”两种麦种，仍用湿接法，把“西北三○二号”麦的胚切下，嫁接在“西北站二号”的胚乳上。共移接了三百粒以上，稀植点播在一块很肥沃的土地上，像慈母抚育婴儿一样，精细地管理培育。第二年春天接种的麦子扬花吐穗了。其中有三株发生了变异，具有“西北站二号”的形状。特别是三株内的一株，个子矮而茎秆粗硬，有八个分蘖，结种子813粒。这便是后来的“五四号”良种。赵济民谨慎地把它单株收藏起来，准备下年种植试验。
    1953年的暑假期，赵济民参加了原西北农林局举办的米丘林作物育种讲习班，比较系统地学习了米丘林的科学理论。当年秋天，他和学生们把这株麦子经过粒选，种植了第二代。这些种子生育过程整齐，没有分离，农艺性状较好，在一厘地的面积上，收获了八斤半种子。平均每穗结九十多粒。当麦子快搭镰的时候，当地许多壮地麦子倒伏了，但这一小畦麦子却依然如故。胜利给赵济民和五四级学生一个很大的鼓舞。
    这时候，正是1954年的夏天，时间给这个小麦取下了名字——“五四号”小麦。同时，“五四号”的出生中，郿县农校五四级学生也出了不少力气，“五四号”名字就更有着双重纪念的意义。
    1954年，“五四号”小麦刚一出生，就引起了陕西省党政领导机关和科学界人士的关怀。当年夏天，省农业厅调赵济民到省农业综合试验站工作。这里是一个专门从事农业科学试验研究工作的机关，比起他在学校的时候的试验条件好得多。站上的同志们帮助他总结了试验经验，并且在农业厅的领导下，一方面继续作品种鉴定，一方面进行示范繁殖。到现在，“五四号”小麦出生仅仅两年，在陕西已经有六处地方在进行区域性的示范工作了。
