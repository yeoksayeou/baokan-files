Comrades representatives, esteemed guests:

The grand gathering of advanced representatives from all fronts of our socialist construction cause—the National Conference of Advanced Producers—is now open.

Attending this conference are representatives of advanced figures among workers, engineers, technicians, and enterprise management personnel; representatives of advanced figures among scientists, cultural workers, educators, and medical workers; and representatives of advanced figures among state organ personnel. These advanced representatives represent the tens of thousands of advanced producers, advanced workers, and advanced units that have emerged in the high tide of socialist construction in our country, and they represent the strong perseverance, creative spirit, and great wisdom of the Chinese working people in the struggle to build socialism.

Peasants and handicraftsmen who have embarked on the road of socialist cooperation have sent representatives to participate in our conference; the heroic Railway Corps, Engineering Corps, and Reclamation Troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have sent representatives to participate in our conference; and the family members of the vast number of workers and staff have also sent representatives to participate in our conference. We extend a warm welcome to them.

Also participating in this conference are brothers and friends of the working class from various countries who have come from afar. We extend a fraternal and warm welcome to the foreign guests.

Among the distinguished guests are advanced producers from the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, who have brought us extremely valuable experience. Here, we would like to express our heartfelt gratitude and warm welcome to them in particular; and we will also strive to learn and promote their advanced experience.

This National Conference of Advanced Producers, initiated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council of the People's Republic of China and hosted by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, is being held under the situation of vigorous development of socialist construction and the decisive victory already achieved in the cause of socialist transformation. Through this conference, we will exchange and summarize advanced production experience and work experience, further promote the spirit of socialist initiative and creativity, in order to mobilize all forces that can be mobilized throughout the country, and do a better, faster, better, and more economical job in various construction undertakings, thereby promoting the accelerated development of our country's socialist construction cause. We believe that this conference will play its due role.

As everyone knows, our country's first five-year plan has been implemented for three years. Thanks to the great efforts made by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and thanks to the assistance of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, all aspects of our socialist construction have overfulfilled the original plans, and significant achievements have been made in all work. In the past three years: on the industrial front, we have increased industrial production by 65%, and put more than 270 newly built and rebuilt major industrial enterprises into production; on the agricultural front, we have increased agricultural and sideline production by 13%, and have effectively controlled seriously harmful rivers, and reclaimed barren mountains and wasteland; on the transportation front, we have increased the volume of freight transportation by 67%, and have built 2,640 kilometers of railways and 6,900 kilometers of important highways; on the commercial front, we have timely supplied residents with their needs for daily necessities; in science, culture, education, and other fronts, we have also made great achievements. In terms of socialist transformation, it has greatly exceeded the original plan tasks. As of the end of March 1956: 90% of the country's farm households have joined agricultural production cooperatives, of which farm households participating in advanced agricultural production cooperatives accounted for 55% of the country's total farm households; 88% of the country's handicraft practitioners have joined handicraft production cooperatives; calculated by output value, 92% of the country's private industry has been transformed into joint state-private ownership; calculated by capital, about 75% of private commerce has implemented joint state-private ownership. The facts of the past three years and more prove that the tasks of our country's first five-year plan are not only possible, but are bound to be completed or overfulfilled ahead of schedule. It should be believed that our 600 million people have the full strength to build their country into an industrially developed socialist country. As we look back on the past and look forward to the future, we are full of high confidence and infinite power in the bright future of our great motherland.

In order to build socialism in our country, we must also carry out economic construction and cultural construction on a scale much larger than in the past. We must not only build industry, but also agriculture, transportation, and develop science, culture, and education. In industrial construction, we must not only build heavy industry, but also light industry; we must not only pay attention to new enterprises, but also give full play to the production capacity of existing enterprises. Only in this way can the various construction undertakings in our country develop in a coordinated manner.

All the representatives present at the meeting, as well as the advanced figures on all production fronts and in all work posts across the country, are the backbone force in our country's socialist construction cause. We hope that after this conference, the nationwide advanced producer movement can be further developed, so that this movement will become the most extensive and profound mass movement, and become the great driving force for the development of our country's socialist economy and socialist culture. To achieve this, we require all advanced figures across the country, especially all the representatives attending this conference, to work diligently and conscientiously, and further improve their cultural, technical, and political and ideological levels; at the same time, actively and patiently help others, especially helping and uniting those who are still backward, seeking common improvement, and turning the backward into the advanced. In this way, we will be able to universally promote advanced experience in production and work, and fully unleash the huge potential forces to serve socialism.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong, we will certainly be able to accelerate the development of our country's socialist cause and build our country into an industrialized socialist country without exploitation and poverty.

Comrades, we should work harder, forge ahead bravely, and advance towards socialism!

    全国先进生产者代表会议开幕词
    李富春
    各位代表们，各位来宾们：
    我国社会主义建设事业各个战线上的先进代表人物的盛大集会——全国先进生产者代表会议，现在开幕了。
    出席这次会议的，有工人、工程技术人员和企业管理人员中的先进人物的代表，有科学工作者、文化工作者、教育工作者和医务工作者的先进人物的代表，有国家机关工作人员中的先进人物的代表。这些先进代表人物，代表着在我国社会主义建设高潮中涌现出来的成千上万的先进生产者、先进工作者和先进单位，代表着中国劳动人民在建设社会主义斗争中的坚强毅力、创造精神和伟大智慧。
    已经走上社会主义合作化道路的农民和手工业者，派代表参加了我们的会议；英雄的中国人民解放军的铁道兵团、工程兵团和屯垦部队，派代表参加了我们的会议；广大工人和职员的家属，也派代表参加了我们的会议。我们对他们表示热烈的欢迎。
    参加这次会议的，还有远道而来的各国工人阶级的弟兄和朋友们。我们对国外的来宾们表示兄弟般的热烈欢迎。
    在贵宾们中间，有苏联和各人民民主国家的先进生产者，他们给我们带来了极宝贵的经验。这里，我们要特别地向他们表示衷心的感谢和热烈的欢迎；并且，我们还将努力地学习和推广他们的先进经验。
    这次由中国共产党中央委员会和中华人民共和国国务院倡议、由中华全国总工会主持的全国先进生产者代表会议，是在全国社会主义建设事业蓬勃高涨和社会主义改造事业已经取得决定性的胜利的形势下召开的。我们将通过这次会议，交流和总结先进的生产经验和工作经验，进一步发扬社会主义的积极精神和创造精神，以便动员全国一切可以动员的力量，把各项建设事业办得又多、又快、又好、又省，从而促进我国社会主义建设事业的加速发展。我们相信，这次会议必将起到它应有的作用。
    大家知道，我国第一个五年计划已经执行了三年。由于全国人民在中国共产党领导下进行了巨大的努力，由于以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的援助，我国社会主义建设的各项事业都超额完成了原定的计划，各项工作都取得了显著的成绩。过去三年中：在工业战线上，我们使工业生产量增长了65％，使新建和改建的二百七十多个重大的工业企业投入了生产；在农业战线上，我们使农业和副业的生产量增长了13％，并且有成效地治理了为害严重的河流，开垦了荒山荒地；在交通运输战线上，我们使货物运输量增长了67％，并且建成了二千六百四十公里的铁路和六千九百公里的重要公路干线；在商业战线上，我们及时地供应了居民对生活必需品的需要；在科学、文化、教育及其他战线上，我们也取得了很大的成就。而在社会主义改造方面，则大大超过了原定的计划任务。到1956年3月底为止：全国有90％的农户已经参加了农业生产合作社，其中参加高级农业生产合作社的农户则占全国农户总数的55％；全国有88％的手工业从业人员已经参加了手工业生产合作社；以产值计算，全国有92％的私营工业已经转变为公私合营；以资本额计算，有75％左右的私营商业已经实行了公私合营。过去三年多的事实证明，我国第一个五年计划的任务，不仅有可能、而且必定会提前完成或超额完成。应当相信，我国六亿人民完全有力量把自己的国家建成为一个工业发达的社会主义国家。当我们回顾过去和瞻望将来的时候，我们对伟大祖国的光辉前途充满着高度的信心和无穷的力量。
    为了在我国建成社会主义，我们还必须进行比以往的规模大得多的经济建设和文化建设。我们不仅要建设工业，而且必须建设农业，建设交通运输业，发展科学、文化、教育事业。在工业的建设中，我们不仅要建设重工业，而且必须建设轻工业；不仅要注意新建企业，而且必须充分发挥原有企业的生产能力。只有这样，才能够使我国各项建设事业相互协调地向前发展。
    到会的全体代表同志们以及全国各个生产战线上和各个工作岗位上的先进人物，是我国社会主义建设事业中的骨干力量。我们希望，在这次会议以后，全国范围的先进生产者运动能够更进一步地开展起来，使这个运动成为最广泛和最深刻的群众运动，成为发展我国社会主义经济和社会主义文化的伟大动力。要做到这一步，我们要求全国所有的先进人物、首先是出席这次会议的全体代表，兢兢业业，进一步提高自己的文化、技术和政治思想水平；同时，积极地和耐心地帮助别人，特别是帮助和团结现在还落后的人，求得共同提高，使落后者变为先进者。这样，我们就有可能把生产和工作中的先进经验普遍加以推广，把巨大的潜在力量充分发挥出来，为社会主义服务。
    在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，我们一定能够加快地发展我国的社会主义事业，把我国建设成为一个没有剥削、没有贫困的工业化的社会主义国家。
    同志们，我们应当更加努力，奋勇前进，向社会主义前进！（附图片）
