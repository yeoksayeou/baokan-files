Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 23rd. Over a thousand family members of students studying in the United States, residing in Shanghai, are requesting government assistance to expedite the return of their relatives to the motherland for family reunions and participation in national construction.

Wang Wenjiang, who works at the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau, said that her husband, Wu Renbo, went to the University of Pennsylvania Medical School in Philadelphia in 1948 to study internal medicine pathology. He is currently working at the Kemi Testing Institute in New York. In a letter dated September 25, 1951, he wrote: "I should arrive in Hong Kong around October 10th, and then proceed immediately to Guangzhou, and then take a train north." However, in a letter written on November 4th, he said: "I arrived in Hawaii on October 25th. At that time, the Immigration Bureau was ordered to prohibit all Chinese students studying science from leaving the country. Seven of us tried to negotiate without success. Helpless, I had to fly back to New York to find work. I am extremely heartbroken and so distraught that I cannot even write." Wang Wenjiang said that her husband used to write to her every week, but since then, communication has been scarce. Wang Wenjiang is very anxious and requests the government to help her reclaim her husband from the U.S. authorities.

Hu Lin, a nurse at the Children's Health Clinic in Luwan District, Shanghai, and a mother of five children, said indignantly to reporters: "In January 1949, I sold my family property to send my husband, Zhu Qiyan, to the University of California to study microbiology, with the agreement that he would return home after a year. Who knew that his requests to the American authorities to return to China would be rejected several times. Subsequently, the American authorities also rudely inspected letters and books sent to him. After the ambassadorial talks between China and the United States reached an agreement on the return of civilians from both sides, our whole family was extremely happy, and relatives and friends came to congratulate us. My little boy, Jiade, who is almost seven years old, was born seven months after his father went abroad, and he also wants to see his father whom he has never met." However, the American government has not yet allowed her husband to return home. Hu Lin also took out many letters from her husband to illustrate how much Zhu Qiyan missed the motherland. In a letter dated March 16, 1954, he wrote: "As a Chinese, I should do things for the motherland." The letter dated August 19 stated: "It is extremely difficult for people like us who have studied at the graduate level and have achieved considerable success in research work to leave the country... If it is said that I can never return, I will be anxious to death. Recently, I have been suffering from neurasthenia and have lost ten pounds..." He also said: "I am Chinese, and I will die in China."

Wen Huixiang, an old lady living at No. 47, Lane 506, Jianguo West Road, said, "My three sons went to the United States to study before liberation. My eldest son, Zhang Jiandong, studies mechanical engineering, my second son, Zhang Jianxin, studies psychopathology and psychology, and my third son, Zhang Jianhua, studies history and economics. In their letter to me on December 14, 1954, they said: "We see that the motherland is becoming stronger day by day, and we are very willing to return home and serve the motherland with what we have learned. But there are many difficulties in returning, and recently another thirty-five students have been detained..." Wen Huixiang often gets sick because she misses her sons. She said: "What right does the American government have to detain my sons? What reason is there to prevent students from returning to their motherland and reuniting with their mothers? This inhuman behavior of the American government will be severely condemned by mothers and all righteous people in the world."

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 24th. As of today, more than 160 family members of students studying in the United States have requested the government of the People's Republic of China to demand the return of their relatives from the U.S. government so that their relatives can return to the motherland and reunite with them as soon as possible.

Chen Shujun, a resident of Toutiao Lane, Baixia District, Nanjing, said that her husband, Wang Yaohua, went to Purdue University in the United States in January 1949 to study civil engineering, obtained a master's degree in 1950, and transferred to Columbia University in New York in 1951 to continue his research. In his letter on July 26, 1952, he said: "The American government does not allow Chinese students studying practical subjects to return to the mainland. I can only wait for an opportunity and stay here temporarily. America is not a place for Chinese people to live in for long, and there is absolutely no future here. Only by returning to China can there be a future for development." The letter also included a photo of himself standing by the sea looking into the distance, with the words of the great Chinese poet Li Bai: "I lower my head and think of my hometown." Since 1953, Chen Shujun has not received any more letters from her husband. She demands that the American government account for her husband's whereabouts.

    上海和南京等地的留美学生家属
    要求政府帮助他们的亲人返回祖国
    新华社上海23日电　有一千多个居住在上海的留美学生家属要求政府帮助他们的亲人早日返回祖国同家人团聚，和参加祖国建设。
    在上海市民政局工作的王文江说，她的丈夫吴仁伯，是在1948年到美国费城宾州医学院学内科病理学的，现在纽约克美试验所工作，他在1951年9月25日写的家信里说：“十月十日左右可到香港，当即赴广州，再乘火车北上。”可是，在十一月四日写的信上却说：“我于十月二十五日到夏威夷，当时移民局受令不准一切学习科学之中国留学生离境，同行七人交涉无效。无可奈何，我只得飞回纽约觅业。我心中痛苦已极，心乱得信也不能写。”王文江说，她丈夫原来每星期总要写一封信给她，从那时起就很少通讯了。王文江非常着急，她要求政府帮助她向美国当局讨还丈夫。
    上海市卢湾区儿童保健所护士、五个孩子的母亲胡琳愤慨地对记者说：“1949年1月，我变卖家产，送丈夫朱其岩到美国加利福尼亚大学学微生物学，约好一年后回国，哪知他几次向美国当局提出返国要求都被拒绝了。此后，美国当局还粗暴地检查寄给他的家信和书籍。中美两国大使级会谈就双方平民回国问题达成协议后，我们全家高兴极了，亲友们也都来祝贺，我的快满七岁的小男孩嘉德是在他父亲出国七个月后出世，他也想看到他从来没有见过的爸爸。”但是，美国政府到现在还没有放她的丈夫回国。胡琳还拿出她丈夫的许多封信，来说明朱其岩是多么想念祖国的。在1954年3月16日的信上写道：“我作为中国人，应当为祖国做事。”八月十九日的信上说：“像我们读到研究院，而且在研究工作上颇有成绩的，极难离境……若是说总不能回去了，我会急死的。最近我老发神经衰弱病，体重跌了十磅……”又说：“我是中国人，死也要死在中国。”
    住在建国西路五百零六弄四十七号的老太太文蕙祥说，我的三个儿子都是解放前到美国读书的。大儿子张建东学机械工程，二儿子张建新学精神病理学和心理学，三儿子张建华学历史和经济学。他们在1954年12月14日写信给我说：“男等看到祖国一天天强大，很愿意回国，把学到的一些东西为祖国服务。但回来有很多困难，最近又有三十五个留学生被扣……”文蕙祥因为思念儿子，经常生病，她说：“美国政府有什么权利扣留我的儿子？有什么理由阻挠留学生回到祖国和他们的母亲团聚？美国政府这种不人道的行为将会受到母亲们和世界上所有正义人士的严厉谴责。”
    据新华社南京24日电　到今天为止，有一百六十多个留美学生的家属要求中华人民共和国政府向美国政府索回亲人；使他们亲人早日返回祖国和他们团聚。
    南京市白下区头条巷居民陈淑君的丈夫王耀华，在1949年1月去美国普渡大学研究土木工程，1950年获得硕士学位，1951年转入纽约哥伦比亚大学继续研究。他在1952年7月26日来信说：“美国政府不准学实科之中国学生返大陆来，我现在唯有候机会而行，暂时留此；美国不是中国人之久居地，绝无前途也，回到中国来，才有发展前途。”信里还附了一张自己站在海边遥望的像片，上面写着祖国伟大诗人李白的诗句：“低头思故乡”。1953年以来，陈淑君再也没有收到过她丈夫的来信。她要求美国政府交代她丈夫的下落。
