The directives state that due to the achievements of socialist industrialization, industrial products in 1955 were more than three times those of 1938. During the first five-year plan, agriculture also developed, but the level of development still lagged behind the requirements of the national economy.

The directives stipulate further development of socialist industry. In 1960, the total industrial output will exceed the 1955 level by 50% to 52%. Total investment in the national economy will reach 80 billion forints (Hungarian currency) in five years. Industrial investment will reach 33 to 34 billion forints. In five years, electricity will increase by 67%, machine tool production will more than double, agricultural machinery production will increase by 110%, and tractor production will increase by 112%.

During the five-year plan, the main tasks in agriculture are to increase agricultural production and to victoriously advance the socialist transformation of the countryside. Agricultural products supplied to the national economy during the second five-year plan will be 27% more than in the first five-year plan. The sown area will be further increased. State investment in agriculture will be 53% more than in the first five-year plan. Six hundred rural areas will be electrified in five years.

In the next five years, the turnover of state-owned trade and cooperative trade will increase by more than 35%.

The real wages of workers and staff will increase by 25% in five years, and the number of workers and staff will increase to 2.45 million. Farmers' income will increase by 25%. During the second five-year plan, a gradual transition to a seven-hour workday system will begin, and efforts will be made to complete it in the third five-year plan. To protect mothers and infants, the statutory maternity leave period will be increased from twelve weeks to fourteen weeks. By 1960, there will be fifteen doctors serving every ten thousand residents.

The number of students in higher education institutions will increase by 40% in five years.

After discussion by the people of the whole country, these directives will be submitted to the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party for review.

The draft directive stipulates that it is necessary to ensure the continued priority development of heavy industry, accelerate the development of fuel and raw material bases, make the most of new achievements in science and technology, widely implement mechanization and gradually implement automation, and greatly improve the degree of intensive cultivation in agricultural production.

In five years, the total industrial output must be increased by at least 60%, of which the production of means of production will increase by about 57%, and the production of consumer goods will increase by 40%. Nine-tenths of the increase in industrial production must be guaranteed by increasing labor productivity.

By 1960, the output of hard coal will approach 29.3 million tons (an increase of 26%), lignite will reach 57.79 million tons (an increase of 49%), electricity will reach 25.34 billion kilowatt-hours (an increase of 68%), pig iron will reach 4.78 million tons (an increase of 60%), steel will reach 6.54 million tons (an increase of 46%), the production of machines and equipment will increase by about 83%, the output of tractors will reach 28,300 units, the output of cotton fabrics and woolen fabrics will reach 439 million meters and 47.2 million meters respectively, the output of meat will reach 457,500 tons, lard will reach 57,500 tons, and butter will reach 69,700 tons.

The production cost of industrial products will be reduced by at least 16%.

During the second five-year plan, the necessary conditions will be created for a wider peaceful utilization of nuclear energy in the third five-year plan. For this purpose, at least one experimental nuclear power station with a capacity of 150,000 kilowatts will begin operating in five years, design work will be carried out for the construction of more nuclear power plants, and the manufacture of equipment for the widespread utilization of nuclear energy will begin. Factories producing uranium and heavy water will begin construction within five years, and the production of radioactive isotopes will be mastered.

In agriculture, the directive stipulates an increase of 22% in grain, 11% in sugar beets, 38% in edible cattle, 35% in pigs, and 46% in milk. Agriculture will receive 36,300 tractors and 8,300 grain harvesting combines in five years. Agriculture will be further collectivized.
