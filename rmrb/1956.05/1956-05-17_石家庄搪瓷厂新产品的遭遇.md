    The Plight of New Products from the Shijiazhuang Enamel Factory
    Local State-Owned Shijiazhuang Enamel Factory
    In order to rapidly improve product quality, meet the needs of the people, and restore the reputation lost in the past due to poor product quality, our factory has successively sent thirty-six workers to fraternal factories in Shanghai to study, and invited five technical workers from fraternal factories to assist in solving quality problems. After several months of hard work, in addition to initially overcoming problems such as non-round diameters, uneven edges, pinholes, exposed iron, and cracks in washbasins and mugs, we have also produced some new colored and floral products, such as colored floral bowls with a diameter of 12 centimeters and colored floral washbasins with rolled edges of 34 centimeters. However, until now, these products with improved quality and new products are still piling up in the warehouse.
    Why are they piling up? Is it because consumers don't like them? No. After the staff of some stores in Shijiazhuang came to the factory to see the samples, they were willing to buy some and put them on the counter to meet the needs of consumers. The problem is that the Shijiazhuang Department Store Wholesale Station, which is responsible for purchasing our factory's products, does not accept them. When we sent people to negotiate several times, the comrades at the wholesale station said: "Aren't you just trial-producing? Who told you to produce them? The stockpiled old products haven't been sold yet. What will happen to the old products after the new products are displayed?" They said that they must adhere to the principle of "first in, first out" (goods that enter the warehouse first are sold first, and goods that enter the warehouse later are sold later). Two purchasing agents wanted to buy 1,200 colored floral bowls with a diameter of 12 centimeters and went to the wholesale station to ask if they had any in stock. The comrades at the wholesale station told them: "Shanghai's products are good, but they are sold out now. The Shijiazhuang Enamel Factory doesn't have such good products." The two comrades didn't believe it and came to our factory to ask. They saw our new products and said they were very good. The comrades at the wholesale station were afraid that the old products would not be sold, and they didn't even dare to tell customers that our factory had new products.
    Currently, our factory has stockpiled more than 3,000 boxes of new products and products with improved quality, worth more than 400,000 yuan. Our funds are already running tight. We urgently hope that the Shijiazhuang Department Store Wholesale Station will quickly allow the new products to meet consumers.

    石家庄搪瓷厂新产品的遭遇
    地方国营石家庄搪瓷厂
    我们工厂为了迅速提高产品质量，以满足人民的需要和挽回过去因产品质量不好而失去的信誉，先后派三十六位工人去上海兄弟工厂学习，并从兄弟工厂请五位技术工人来厂协助解决质量问题。经过最近几个月的努力，我们除了初步克服脸盆、口盅的口径不圆、边不平、砂眼、露铁、裂纹等毛病外，还生产一部分彩色带花的新产品，如口径十二公分的彩色花碗，三十四公分的卷边彩色带花脸盆等。但是，直到现在，这些质量改进了的产品和新产品，仍然积压在仓库里。
    为什么积压呢？是消费者不喜欢吗？不是的。石家庄一些商店的工作人员来厂看样品以后，都愿意购买一些摆到柜台里去，以满足消费者的需要。问题是包销我们工厂产品的石家庄百货公司批发站不收购。当我们几次派人去交涉的时候，批发站的同志说：“你们不是只试制吗？谁叫你们生产呢？积压的旧产品没卖掉，新产品摆出来以后，旧产品怎么办呢？”他们说，他们必须掌握“先进先出”的原则（先进仓库的商品先卖，后进仓库的商品后卖）。有两位采购人员想买一千二百只十二公分的彩色花碗，到批发站去问有没有货。批发站的同志对他们说：“上海的产品好，但是现在卖完了。石家庄搪瓷厂没有这样的好货。”这两位同志不相信，就到我们工厂来问。他们看见我们的新产品，都说很好。批发站的同志因为怕旧产品卖不掉，甚至不敢对顾客说我们工厂有新产品。
    现在，我们工厂里已经积压了三千多箱新产品和质量改进了的产品，价值四十万多元。我们的资金已经周转不灵了。我们迫切希望石家庄百货公司批发站迅速让新产品跟消费者见面。
