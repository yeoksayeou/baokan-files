A major sign of whether a newspaper is closely connected to reality is whether it can promptly raise significant problems in life and adopt effective ways to promote the actual solution of these problems. Recently, the *Southern Daily's* publicity regarding strengthening the Party organization's specific leadership over agricultural production is a relatively good example of doing this.

The *Southern Daily* raised this issue based on the following situation. After the basic realization of agricultural cooperation in the rural areas of Guangdong, agricultural production showed unprecedented upsurge, and striving for high agricultural output increases has become a realistic possibility. However, turning this possibility into reality still depends on the specific leadership of the Party organization. At that time, there were two situations regarding the rural Party organization's leadership over production: one was specific leadership that went deep into reality and connected with the masses; this kind of leadership could guarantee the realization of the production increase plan. The other was general leadership; many Party organizations were only busy with holding meetings, issuing instructions, and making plans, abandoning in-depth and meticulous ideological work and organizational work among the masses. Obviously, this bureaucratic leadership style and method risked causing the production increase plan to fail. The *Southern Daily* saw that this was an important problem that urgently needed to be solved in current rural work and brought it to the readers' attention.

The *Southern Daily* did not raise this issue in a general way, but sharply raised the issue. The newspaper first seized on typical examples of the general leadership style to launch criticism. The criticism of the Ding'an County Party Committee published in the "Party Life" column on March 20 was one such example. The Ding'an County Party Committee formulated a production increase plan that seemed very good, and also stipulated equally good basic measures. However, after formulating the plan and measures, they did not go deep into the cadres and masses to organize forces to implement the plan, but were busy holding meetings and issuing instructions in the office, so their production increase plan remained only on paper and in words. Water conservancy construction was a crucial production increase measure in this county, but by the spring plowing season, only 1.2% of the county's small-scale water conservancy plan had been completed. Other work was also not done well. This was very likely to cause the production increase plan to fail. In order to help people learn from this fact and other similar facts, the newspaper successively published two editorials, analyzing the serious harm of the general leadership style, and discussing that after the realization of cooperation, the Party organization's responsibility for leading agricultural production was not reduced but increased.

The *Southern Daily* also revealed the evil consequences of general leadership from many aspects. Articles such as "In the Hall of the Baishui Township People's Committee" and "Too Many Meetings Become a 'Disaster'" and some letters from Party members, explained that too many meetings were held at the top, and the cadres below were exhausted. The leading organs only held meetings and issued instructions, urging the lower levels for figures every day, which also fostered the bad practice of some grassroots cadres making false reports. The *Southern Daily* exposed the erroneous behavior of some Party members and cadres in Kaiping County making false reports, and pointed out that the bureaucratic leadership style of the higher-level organs was a breeding ground for false reports. The *Southern Daily* also published an article entitled "Infectious Disease," explaining that some bad styles had "infected" the grassroots organizations, and even some Party branch committees closed their doors to draft and issue lengthy "instructions" to guide the work, using lifeless red tape to replace lively ideological work and organizational work. This further illustrates how urgent it is to oppose general leadership.

The *Southern Daily's* attack on the general leadership style was powerful. But the task of the newspaper is not only to oppose incorrect things; especially to point out what is correct. What is the specific leadership that we want to promote?

Based on the leadership experience of Party organizations at all levels, the *Southern Daily* repeatedly explained in a series of editorials such as "Leadership Must Be Specific" and "Grand Inspection of Spring Plowing Preparation Work" that the three problems that must be solved to implement specific leadership are: starting from the actual situation, grasping the production season and production key; checking the work in a timely manner, and solving problems as soon as they are discovered; attaching importance to and promoting the advanced experience of the masses, and using typical demonstration methods to carry out the work.

The newspaper also provided readers with many convincing facts to prove that the Party organization has made greater achievements in production due to the implementation of specific leadership. For example, one article introduced that the Sanshui County Party Committee was able to conduct timely inspections in the preparation for spring plowing work, and found that 17.6% of the townships were very backward in production. They quickly took measures to solve them, and as a result, the work of most of the backward townships caught up. For example, the newspaper once used these two examples to make a comparison to illustrate the importance of promoting advanced experience and adopting typical demonstration methods: after the Yangjiang County Party Committee discovered the experience of Bianhai Township in digging level ponds to resist drought, it summarized it, organized visits, and vigorously promoted it, so that the problem of resisting drought, which had been difficult to solve for several years, was solved. On the contrary, in Xuwen County, although there was also the advanced experience of Nalang Township in digging wells to resist drought, but because the Xuwen County Party Committee did not actively promote it, the vivid example was buried, and the county's work to eliminate drought has been slow to progress.

The *Southern Daily* promptly raised the urgent issue of improving the leadership style and leadership methods, and fully carried out criticism and self-criticism, and vigorously promoted positive factors. The newspaper's publicity had a great impact on actual life. For example, after the newspaper criticized the Ding'an County Party Committee, the Hainan District Party Committee linked and inspected its own general leadership style, and put forward specific measures to improve leadership. After the Huaxian County Party Committee was criticized by the newspaper, most of the county committee members went to the countryside to strengthen specific leadership over production. Of course, the *Southern Daily* also has shortcomings in this publicity. Although the newspaper focused on criticizing the bad style of relying solely on holding meetings, issuing instructions, and listening to reports to carry out leadership, pointing out its harm, it did not theoretically explain that this is a manifestation of subjectivism and bureaucracy. When explaining the issue of specific leadership, it also did not do so.

　　及时地提出生活中的问题
    丹元
    一个报纸联系实际是否密切，主要的标志是看它能不能及时地提出生活中的重大问题，并且采用有效的方式促使问题得到实际解决。最近一个时期南方日报关于加强党组织对农业生产的具体领导的宣传，就是这样做的一个比较好的例子。
    南方日报提出这个问题，是从以下的情况出发的。在广东农村基本上实现了农业合作化以后，农业生产呈现了空前的高涨，争取农业的高额增产已经具备了现实的可能性。但是要把这种可能性变成现实性，还要取决于党组织的具体领导。而当时农村党组织对生产的领导有两种状况：一种是深入实际，联系群众的具体领导，这种领导就能够保证增产计划的实现。另一种是一般化的领导，不少的党组织只是忙于开会、发指示、作计划，放弃了对群众进行深入细致的思想工作和组织工作。十分明显，这种官僚主义的领导作风和领导方法，有使增产计划落空的危险。南方日报看出了这是当前农村工作中亟待解决的一个重要问题，就把它着重地提到读者的面前来。
    南方日报不是泛泛地提出这个问题，而是尖锐地提出了问题。报纸首先抓住了一般化领导作风的典型事例展开批评。三月二十日在党的生活栏中发表的对定安县委的批评，就是这样的事例之一。定安县委制定了一个看来很不错的增产计划，并且规定了同样不错的基本措施。可是他们在制定了计划和措施之后，并没有深入到干部和群众中去组织力量来执行这个计划，而是忙着在办公室里开会、发指示，结果他们的增产计划也就停留在口头上和纸面上。兴修水利是这个县带关键性的增产措施，可是到春耕季节，全县的小型水利计划只完成了1.2％。其他工作也做得不好。这就很有可能使增产计划落空。为了帮助人们从这个事实和别的类似的事实吸取教训，报纸连续发表两篇社论，分析了一般化领导作风的严重危害，论述了在实现合作化以后，党组织对农业生产的领导责任不是减轻而是加重了。
    南方日报还从多方面揭露了一般化领导的恶果。报纸发表的“在白水乡人民委员会的大厅里”，“会多成‘灾’”等文章和一些党员来信，说明了上面开会太多，下面干部就疲于奔命。领导机关光是开会、发指示，天天向下面催要数字，也助长了一些基层干部虚报成绩的恶劣作风。南方日报揭发了开平县部分党员、干部做假报告的错误行为，并且指出了上级机关的官僚主义领导作风是产生假报告的温床。南方日报还发表了题为“传染病”的文章，说明某些不良的作风已经“传染”到基层组织，就连一些党支部委员会也关起门来起草和印发长篇“指示”来指导工作，用死气沉沉的文牍主义来代替生动活泼的思想工作和组织工作。这就进一步说明了反对一般化的领导，具有多么迫切的意义。
    南方日报对一般化领导作风的抨击是有力的。但是报纸的任务还不仅是反对不正确的东西；尤其要指出什么是正确的东西。什么是我们所要提倡的具体领导呢？
    南方日报根据各级党组织的领导经验，在“领导必须具体”、“备耕工作大检查”等一系列的社论中，反复地阐明了实行具体领导必须解决的三个问题，就是从实际情况出发，紧紧抓住生产季节和生产关键；及时地检查工作，一发现问题就去解决；重视和推广群众中的先进经验，运用典型示范的办法进行工作。
    报纸还向读者提供了不少有说服力的事实证明党组织由于实行具体领导，因而在生产方面做出了较大成绩。例如有一篇文章介绍三水县委在备耕、春耕工作中能够及时地进行检查，就发现17.6％的乡在生产上很落后，他们就迅速采取措施加以解决，结果大部分落后乡的工作都赶上来了。又如报纸曾经用这样两个例子进行对比，来说明推广先进经验和采用典型示范方法的重要性：阳江县委发现了边海乡挖平塘来抗御旱灾的经验以后，就进行总结，组织参观，大力推广，使得几年来难以解决的抗御旱灾的问题得到了解决。相反地，在徐闻县虽然也有那朗乡挖井抗旱的先进经验，但是由于徐闻县委没有积极地加以推广，结果这个活生生的榜样被埋没掉，这个县的消灭旱灾的工作也就迟迟得不到进展。
    南方日报及时提出了改进领导作风和领导方法这个迫切的问题，又充分地开展了批评和自我批评，大力地发扬了积极的因素，报纸的宣传就对实际生活产生了很大的影响。例如，在报纸批评了定安县委以后，海南区党委就联系检查了自己的一般化的领导作风，并且提出了改进领导的具体措施。花县县委在受到报纸批评以后，县委委员大部分都分头下乡，加强了对生产的具体领导。自然，南方日报在这一宣传中也是有缺点的。报纸虽然着重地批判了单纯依靠开会、发指示、听汇报来进行领导这种大量存在的不良作风，指出了它的害处，但没有从理论上阐明这是主观主义、官僚主义的表现。在阐明具体领导问题的时候，同样也没有这样做。
