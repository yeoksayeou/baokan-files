    Science Popularization Associations in Shenyang and Other Places
    Widely Publicize Scientific and Technological Knowledge
    More than 1,500 members of the Science Popularization Associations in Shenyang, Dalian, Anshan, and other places have given 2,472 lectures, and compiled and published 242 kinds of popular booklets and lecture notes, widely publicizing various scientific and technological knowledge. The Dalian Science Popularization Association has held 65 picture-based study classes for workers, with a total of 2,200 workers participating, 90% of whom achieved good results in the examinations. After listening to the "Speedy Picture Reading Method" lecture, Li Shaogong, a worker at the Shenyang Agricultural Machinery Factory, improved the seeding box and left and right dies on the 24-row seeder, increasing work efficiency by 33%. The Dalian Science Popularization Association printed and distributed 45,000 copies of 13 kinds of agricultural technical materials on fertilizer accumulation, feed, horticulture, etc., to farmers, and held various exhibitions for farmers on cutworms, astronomy and meteorology, maternal and child health, etc. After seeing the exhibition, the farmers said: "It turns out that the cutworm is transformed from the cutworm moth, not some kind of god worm. As long as the cutworm moths are caught, they can be prevented and controlled."

    沈阳等地科学普及协会
    广泛宣传科学技术知识
    沈阳、旅大、鞍山等地科学普及协会的一千五百多名会员，曾经作了2，472次讲演，编写出版了242种通俗小册子和讲稿，广泛地宣传了各种科学技术知识。旅大市科学普及协会为工人举办了六十五个看图学习班，参加学习的工人共有二千二百人，其中90％的工人考试获得了良好的成绩。沈阳农业机械厂工人李绍恭听了“速成看图法”讲课后，改进了二十四行播种机上的播种盒和左右胎具，提高工作效率33％。旅大市科学普及协会向农民印发了积肥、饲料、园艺等十三种农业技术资料共四万五千册，并为农民举办了有关夜盗虫、天文气象、妇幼卫生等多种展览会。农民看了展览后说：“原来夜盗虫是从夜盗蛾变成的，不是什么神虫，只要捕净夜盗蛾就可以防治了”。
