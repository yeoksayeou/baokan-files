    Rapidly Support the Karamay Oil Region
    Shen Shi
    Karamay in Xinjiang is a newly discovered oil-producing area in our country with the most promising prospects. Four exploratory wells in this area have already gushed crude oil, and the remaining exploratory wells also have a high probability of producing oil. After the four exploratory wells produced oil, the oil and gas layers were very good during the oil testing.
    Compared with Lao Junmiao in Gansu, the Karamay Oilfield not only has a wider distribution of oil sources but also a richer oil content. Therefore, the task facing the Xinjiang Petroleum Company is how to accelerate drilling and develop the oilfield early. However, developing a new oilfield requires more than just the company's strength; it needs support from the entire country.
    Currently, the company has a large amount of equipment piled up at Khorgas on the border. Due to insufficient vehicles, this equipment cannot be transported to the new construction site in a timely manner. The oil testing equipment for drilling is also not being supplied in a timely manner. The People's Committee of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region recently allocated a batch of vehicles, but it still cannot keep up with the demand. To develop the new oilfield, more technical personnel and workers are needed, but the company's technical strength is also unable to keep up with the needs of the new situation. Therefore, it is urgent to quickly solve these critical problems and develop this most promising oil region as early as possible.

    迅速支援克拉玛依油区
    沈石
    新疆的克拉玛依，是新近发现的我国最有希望的石油产区。这个地区已经有四口探井喷出原油，其余的探井出油的希望也很大。四口探井出油以后，在试油当中，油层的油和气都很良好。
    克拉玛依油田，比起甘肃老君庙来，不但油源分布广，含油量也更丰富。因此，摆在新疆石油公司面前的任务，是怎样加速钻探，提早开发油田。但是，开发新的油田，单凭这个公司的力量远远不够，必须有全国的支援。
    现在这个公司有大量的器材堆积在国境线上的霍尔果斯，由于车辆不够，这批器材不能及时地运到新的工地。钻井用的试油设备也得不到及时供应。新疆维吾尔自治区人民委员会最近增拨了一批汽车，但是仍然赶不上需要。要开发新的油田，还要增加技术人员和工人，但是这个公司的技术力量也赶不上新形势的需要。因此，迅速解决这些关键性的问题，使这一最有希望的油区提早开发，是迫不及待的事。
