New Uses for Sunflowers

The light and soft pith of sunflower stalks can be used as heat-insulating and sound-absorbing building materials. Ding Changguo, Chen Yexun, and Zhong Jinliang, teachers in the Architecture Department of Tongji University, discovered this new use for sunflowers.

After testing, the first batch of sunflower pith boards trial-produced by the Shanghai Yangzi Wood Factory has a thermal conductivity that is four-fifths lower than wood wool boards and one-third lower than reed boards; its sound absorption is also better than paper clapboards. This board is very light and soft, comparable to cork.

These three teachers at Tongji University also used the skin of sunflower stalks to press and glue into boards. The hardness of this type of board is even better than that of fir wood boards, and it can be used to replace wooden boards as flooring and partition boards on cement, and other building materials.

    向日葵的新用途
    轻软的向日葵梗心可以做隔热和吸音的建筑材料。同济大学建筑系教师丁昌国、陈业勋和钟金梁发见了向日葵的这种新用途。
    在上海杨子木材厂第一批试制成功的向日葵心板经过试验，导热能力比木丝板低五分之四、比芦苇板低三分之一；吸音能力也比纸拍板好。这种板非常轻软，同软木相差无几。
    同济大学的这三位教师同时利用向日葵梗的皮加压胶合成为板材。这种板的坚硬度比杉木板还要好一些，可以代替木板用作铺在水泥上的地板和隔板等建筑材料。　（新华社）
