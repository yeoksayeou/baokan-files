    "Let this Southern Red Bean Flourish in the Motherland's Garden"
    Guangdong Cantonese Opera Performances in the Capital Widely Welcomed and Valued
    The Guangdong Cantonese Opera Troupe left Beijing for Shanghai on the 25th for performances. From May 2nd, the Cantonese Opera Troupe performed "The Searching of the Academy," "Qin Xianglian," "Abandoning the Son," "Wang Xifeng," and "The Tea Bottle Plot" in Beijing. People from all walks of life were very satisfied, and almost every performance was sold out.
    Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier Zhou Enlai, and many leaders of state organs watched their performances. On the eve of the Cantonese Opera Troupe's departure from Beijing, Premier Zhou Enlai invited the main actors of the Cantonese Opera Troupe and people from Beijing's theatrical circles to a discussion. Premier Zhou pointed out that Cantonese Opera has made a lot of progress in recent years, especially in opera music, which has things that other opera genres can learn from. Premier Zhou hoped that they would bring forth the new from the old, so that this southern red bean would flourish in the motherland's garden.
    During the Cantonese Opera Troupe's stay in Beijing, the Ministry of Culture and the Chinese Dramatists Association held two symposiums for them. The invited literary and art figures gave a very high evaluation of the Cantonese Opera Troupe's achievements in Cantonese Opera reform and the actors' performing arts.

    “让这颗南国的红豆在祖国大花园里茂盛成长” 
    广东粤剧在首都公演受到普遍欢迎和重视
    广东粤剧团二十五日离北京去上海公演。粤剧团从五月二日开始，在北京演出了“搜书院”、“秦香莲”、“放子”、“王熙凤”和“茶瓶计”等剧目，各界人士都很满意，几乎每场都是满座。
    刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理和很多国家机关的领导人都观看了他们的演出。粤剧团离京前夕，周恩来总理邀集了粤剧团的主要演员和北京戏剧界人士座谈。周总理指出，几年来粤剧有了很多进步，特别是在戏曲音乐方面，有了值得其他剧种借镜的地方。周总理希望他们推陈出新，让这颗南国的红豆在祖国的大花园里茂盛成长。
    粤剧团在北京期间，文化部和中国戏剧家协会曾为他们举行两次座谈会，应邀出席的文艺界人士对粤剧团进行粤剧改革方面的成就，以及演员们的表演艺术给以相当高的评价。
