Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 27th: Thirty joint state-private machine and electrical factories in Shanghai will undergo large-scale expansion in the next two years. The Shanghai Municipal Local Industry Department has developed a plan for the development of the machinery and electrical appliance industries. Several dozen other joint state-private factories will also add machinery and equipment or build factory buildings as needed for production development. The factories preparing for expansion mainly manufacture power equipment, ships, precision machine tools, large-scale paper-making machines, printing presses, electrical equipment, automatic recording instruments, petroleum machinery parts, automobile parts, and large castings. The state urgently needs to increase the output and variety of these products.

Not long ago, the Shanghai Local Industry Department, together with relevant central departments, conducted another survey of the joint state-private machine and electrical industry. The conclusion of the survey was that the small factory sites and scattered production inherited from the private period had limited the further development of production potential. In some factories, after a new machine was manufactured, the roof or walls had to be dismantled before it could be shipped out. In many factories, the finished product assembly work was carried out on the sidewalks of the road. Because one product had to be manufactured by dozens of small factories scattered in various places, the long-term waste and losses far exceeded the investment necessary to build new factory buildings.

Among the thirty factories that will undergo large-scale expansion, twelve factories will move from their original small factory buildings to newly built factory buildings. Another eighteen will be expanded on their original sites. After the expansion is completed, these thirty factories will merge ten to eighty small factories respectively to form large, independent production factories. Their production capacity can be increased by more than doubled next year. The working conditions of the workers will also be greatly improved.

The entire expansion project will be funded by the government. According to preliminary estimates, the entire investment can be recovered within two years from the profits earned after these factories expand production. Because the increase is only in factory building construction and some precision, heavy-duty machinery and lifting equipment, the investment required is about 70% less than that required to build factories of the same scale in the inland areas.

    上海准备扩建一批公私合营机电工厂
    据新华社上海27日电　上海三十家公私合营机电工厂将在今明两年进行规模较大的扩建。上海市地方工业部门已经作出了机械、电器工业的发展规划。还有几十家公私合营工厂，也将根据生产发展的需要，添置机器设备或修建厂房。这批准备扩建的工厂，大都是制造动力设备、船舶、精密机床、大型造纸机、印刷机、电器设备、自动纪录仪表、石油机械配件、汽车配件以及大型铸件的工厂。国家急需增加这些产品的产量和品种。
    不久以前，上海地方工业部门会同中央有关部门对公私合营机电工业的情况又作了一次调查。调查中得出的结论是，私营时期遗留下来的厂址狭小和生产的分散，已经限制了生产潜力的进一步发挥。有的工厂制成了一部新机器，必须把屋顶或墙壁拆去以后才能够装运出去，不少工厂的成品装配工作是在马路的人行道上进行的。由于一项产品必须由几十家散处各方的小工厂协作制造，长期的浪费和损失远远超过建造新厂房所必需的投资。
    在将进行规模较大的扩建的三十家工厂中，有十二家工厂将要从原有的狭小厂房中搬到新建造的厂房去。另外有十八家在原来的厂址进行扩建。在扩建完成后，这三十家工厂将分别有十家到八十家小工厂合并进去，组成独立生产的大型工厂。它们的生产能力在明年就可以提高一倍以上。工人的劳动条件也将有很大的改善。
    全部扩建工程，将由政府投资。根据初步估算，全部投资在两年以内就可以在这些工厂扩大生产以后所获的利润中收回来。由于增加的只是厂房建筑和部分精密的、重型的机器设备和起重设备，和在内地新建同样规模的工厂所需要的投资比较，可以节省70％左右。
