	“Busy” and “Idle”
	Zhang Jun
	Currently, many places are using full-time theory instructors as "mobile cadres," assigning them many other tasks. For example, in Yichang City, Hubei Province, three out of four instructors have been drawn away to work on conscription, counter-espionage, and other tasks, leaving only one instructor to handle the theoretical education work of more than two thousand cadres in the entire city. In Xiangtan Prefecture, Hunan Province, out of fifteen theory instructors, only two in the directly subordinate organs of the prefecture are full-time; the remaining thirteen are part-time. Some are frequently sent to work in the countryside for dozens of days at a time; others are assigned to oversee the education of cadres' family members and domestic helpers, as well as the inspection of cleanliness in the organs, which almost squeezes out their primary work. As for theory instructors also managing education funds, purchasing books, and collecting materials, this is an even more common phenomenon.
	The leaders in these places believe that if they don't give theory instructors other work to do, they will have nothing to do, or they will become detached from reality and the masses. They say, "You have to manage something, you can't be detached from the masses!" When they see instructors reading books, they say, "Nothing to do again, reading books again!" They also think that instructors reading books is a so-called "purely theoretical viewpoint," and "Isn't preparing lessons easy? One day is enough, why would you need two days!"
	Obviously, these comrades, if not belittling theoretical education work, are at least not understanding the characteristics of the work of theory instructors. The main responsibility of theory instructors is to lecture. The main criterion for judging the quality of theory instructors' work is to see how many lectures they have given, whether they can complete the teaching tasks according to the teaching plan, and what the quality of teaching is like. In order for theory instructors to be able to give more lectures and give them well, they should first be guaranteed enough time to read and prepare lessons. Even experienced and mature instructors cannot do without reading and lesson preparation time, especially since most of our theory instructors today have not been engaged in this work for too long, and their theoretical foundation and teaching experience are not very high, so it is especially necessary to give them more time to read and prepare lessons. Where is there any question of "purely theoretical viewpoint," "detachment from reality," or "detachment from the masses" here?
	But there are also theory instructors who are too "idle"! A theory instructor in Yangzhong County, Jiangsu Province, said: Over the past year, only one of the theory instructors there has given a few lectures, and the others have been doing administrative work such as distributing study materials and taking meeting minutes. This work is not much, so when they get bored from reading books every day, they go out to "count stones." To be "bored" to the point of "counting stones" is truly idle to the extreme! Some people may have found evidence that theory instructors have nothing to do from here. But we must ask: Doesn't this situation precisely prove that the leading comrades in some places are extremely negligent in the use and training of theory instructors? They either add a large pile of part-time jobs to theory instructors, making them too "busy" to neglect their main duties; or simply leave theory instructors "idle" there, without getting a chance to lecture even once a year. In short, these are not correct ways to use and train full-time theory instructors. It is time for this phenomenon to end!

### “忙”和“闲”

    “忙”和“闲”
    张君
    现在有不少地方把专职理论教员当成“机动干部”使用，给他们分配了很多其他工作。例如湖北宜昌市四个教员有三个被抽去搞兵役、肃反等工作，全市二千多干部的理论教育工作只好由一个教员来做。湖南湘潭专区十五个理论教员，除专区直属机关两人是专职外，其余十三人都是兼职，有的经常被派下乡工作，而且一去几十天；有的被指定兼管干部家属和保姆的教育、机关清洁卫生检查等工作，几乎挤掉了他的本位工作。至于理论教员兼管教育经费、购买图书、收集资料等等，就更是普遍的现象了。
    这些地方的领导人员认为不给理论教员作点别的工作，他们就没事干，或者他们会脱离实际脱离群众。他们说：“你得管点事，不能脱离群众！”他们看到教员看书，就说：“没有事干了，又看书啦！”他们还认为教员看书是所谓“单纯理论观点”，“备课还不容易吗？一天就行了，那里要得两天囉！”
    显然，这些同志如果不是轻视理论教育工作，至少也是不了解理论教员工作的特点。理论教员的主要职责是讲课，检查理论教员工作成绩好坏的主要标准，就是看他们讲了多少课，能不能按照教学计划来完成教学任务，以及教学质量如何。为了使理论教员能够多讲课，讲得好，首先应该保证他们能有足够的时间读书、备课。即使是老练的、成熟的教员，也不能没有读书和备课时间，何况今天我们的多数理论教员从事这一工作并不太久，他们的理论基础和教学经验并不是很高的，给他们以较多的时间读书、备课，就尤其必要。这里又何尝有什么“单纯理论观点”“脱离实际”“脱离群众”的问题呢？
    但是也有的理论教员又太“闲”了！江苏扬中县有位理论教员说：一年来，那里的理论教员只有一个人讲过几次课，其他的人都是做些发学习材料、作会议记录等事务工作，这些工作究竟是不多的，于是每天看书看得闷的时候，就出去“数石头”。“闷”到“数石头”的地步，可也真是闲极无聊了！有人也许正是从这里找到了理论教员没事干的证据。可是我们要问一句：这种情况不恰恰是证明有些地方的领导同志极其忽视对理论教员的使用和培养么？他们或者是给理论教员加上一大堆兼职，使其“忙”得不务正业；或者干脆让理论教员“闲”在那里，终年得不到一次讲课的机会；总之，这都不是正确地去使用和培养专职理论教员的现象。这种现象是该终止的时候了！
