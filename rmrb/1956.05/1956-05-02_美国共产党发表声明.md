　　美国共产党发表声明
    新华社柏林1日电　纽约消息：美国“工人日报”四月二十九日刊载了美国共产党全国委员会的五一节声明。
    声明说，在1956年五一节，美国劳动人民已经比以前任何时候更有决心来争取和平、团结、民主和平等权利。声明回顾了过去一年国际局势中有利于和平的发展以及美国劳工运动和民主运动所取得的成就。
    声明指出，由于美国劳联和产联的合并而出现的美国劳工运动的统一已经为劳工的独立的立法和政治活动开辟了新的可能性。声明号召美国劳工运动在1956年的总统选举中把工人、农民、黑人、小商人、专业人士和一切希望建成一个和平、进步与民主的美国的人们团结起来。声明号召支持美国劳动农民的要求，并且加紧争取民主自由和保障人权的斗争。
    声明说：重新彻底审查美国外交政策的要求正在日益增长。人类正在不顾美国反动派的阻挠朝着和平共处前进。
    在裁军方面的具体步骤、所有大国共同努力来导致以色列和阿拉伯国家之间的直接谈判、扩大东西方贸易、接纳中国加入联合国、发展同社会主义国家的广泛的文化交流、一个中立的和非军国主义化的德国——这是一些可以使美国人民以较低代价（这意味着较低的捐税）得到更大的安全和在各国之间建立起一个坚固的和平结构的措施。
    声明最后说，美国共产党人保证和我国千百万同胞并肩努力，以谋求美国的福利，谋求美国的民主和和平的前途。
