    Two Unusual Watermelon Seeds
    In the newly opened exhibition room of the Kunming Working Station of the Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, are two unusual types of watermelon seeds. One type, called "Youzhaguo" (Oil Residue Fruit), is as big as a duck egg, each weighing about two ounces. When the shell is peeled open, there are two tender white melon kernels inside. The other type is the same size as ordinary pumpkin seeds, but it has no shell when it is cut out from the melon. This saves the trouble of shelling when eating.
    Both of these types of watermelon seeds are of economic value. In addition to being as crisp and delicious as ordinary watermelon seeds, they are particularly rich in protein and fat. If they are planted on a large scale, they can be used as supplementary food or for oil extraction.
    The person in charge of the Kunming Working Station of the Institute of Botany told reporters that the plants that grow these two types of watermelon seeds are currently rare in the world. The shell-less watermelon seed is a seed from a pumpkin that is native to Africa. In 1950, Chinese botanists introduced it from abroad to the botanical garden of the Kunming Working Station of the Institute of Botany, and it has been successfully trial-planted. This pumpkin bears many melons and seeds, proving that the climate conditions in Yunnan are suitable for cultivation, and it has now begun to be promoted. The large watermelon seeds grow in a perennial wild melon. This plant grows in the tropical region of southern Yunnan. It was discovered by Chinese botanists in 1931 and was transplanted to the botanical garden of the Kunming Working Station of the Institute of Botany last year for artificial cultivation.

    两种奇异的瓜子
    在中国科学院植物研究所昆明工作站新辟的陈列室中，放着两种奇异的瓜子。一种瓜子叫油渣果，有鸭蛋那么大，每颗重约二市两，剥开壳，里面是两瓣白嫩的瓜仁。另一种瓜子同普通的南瓜子一样大小，但从瓜肚里剖出来就没有壳，吃的时候可省去剥壳的麻烦。
    这两种瓜子都富有经济价值，它们除同普通瓜子一样清脆可口外，含蛋白质和脂肪特别丰富，如果大量种植，可做副食品，也可用来榨油。
    植物研究所昆明工作站的负责人对记者说：生长这两种瓜子的植物都是目前世界上稀有的。无壳瓜子是一种南瓜结的子，这种南瓜原产在非洲，1950年，中国植物学家从国外引种到植物研究所昆明工作站的植物园后，已试种成功。这种南瓜结的瓜和子很多，证明云南气候条件适宜栽培，现已开始推广。大瓜子结在一种多年生的野生瓜里。这种植物长在云南南部的热带地区，1931年被中国植物学家发现，去年移栽到植物研究所昆明工作站的植物园内，进行人工培植。　（新华社）
