Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 6th - The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Fujian Provincial People's Committee jointly announced an instruction today, requiring Party and government leading organs at all levels to fully mobilize the masses and vigorously implement the principle of diligence and thrift in running cooperatives, to ensure that every agricultural production cooperative can increase production and that the vast majority of members can increase their income.
    The instruction stipulates: On the one hand, agricultural cooperatives in various localities should promote democracy, launch a rationalization proposal campaign, mobilize members to fully utilize their labor potential, find ways to increase production, and save costs; on the other hand, they are required to strictly control financial and work-day expenditures. The instruction stipulates that in the next three to five years, agricultural cooperatives must resolutely refrain from building non-productive capital construction projects such as offices and auditoriums; the annual fixed remuneration for agricultural cooperative cadres and the work points for general cooperative cadres and members due to work delays caused by cooperative affairs, together with the expenditure on administrative management expenses of the agricultural cooperative, should preferably not exceed 2% of the total annual production value for small cooperatives and not exceed 1% for large cooperatives; the public welfare fund drawn by the agricultural cooperative should not exceed 2% of the actual income of the current year, and the expenditure on cultural and welfare undertakings run within the cooperative should be controlled within the scope of the public welfare fund drawn in the current year. For the management of libraries and clubs, and for labor expenditures such as postmen not related to agricultural cooperative production, young activists can be mobilized to take charge of management and concurrently perform these duties during their spare time, and work points should not be paid by the agricultural cooperative.
    The instruction criticized the tendency in various localities to neglect economic crops and sideline production, and required that while ensuring increased grain production, all localities should also strengthen leadership in developing diverse economic production. All agricultural cooperatives should actively open up avenues for sideline production and establish combined contracts of different forms such as pre-purchase, pre-sale, processing, and transportation with supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned specialized companies to strengthen production planning and ensure increased production for agricultural cooperatives and increased income for members.
    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 6th - Farmers in Yuanjiang County, Hunan Province, are utilizing the slack season after rice transplanting to carry out sideline production activities according to local conditions.
    Many of the inland lakes and ditches that were abandoned in the past in this county have now been tidied up and planted with aquatic crops such as lotus roots and water chestnuts. At night, fishing lights twinkle on the water along both banks of the river, as farmers are busy catching young seedlings during the fish fry hatching season.
    Dongting Red Agricultural Cooperative has recently caught more than 400,000 fish fry. The cooperative also raises 273 pigs, including 200 sows that will be able to reproduce 1,400 piglets by June.
    In order to strengthen leadership and technical guidance for sideline production, the Yuanjiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a meeting of the captains of the sideline production teams of various agricultural cooperatives to study the issue of sideline production. The Yuanjiang County Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy is holding training classes on duck raising, fish farming, livestock disease prevention, and feeding techniques one after another, preparing to train 1,000 sideline technicians.
    At present, all agricultural production cooperatives in the county have comprehensively formulated plans for developing sideline production according to local natural conditions and the needs of the state and individuals, preparing to engage in more than 30 kinds of sideline occupations.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 6th - In order to ensure increased income for its members, Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Licheng County, Shandong Province, has recently corrected its bias of only engaging in agricultural production and not engaging in sideline production.
    After inspecting the tendency to neglect sideline production in mid-April, the management committee of the cooperative lined up sideline production projects and found twelve avenues for sideline production that were customary in the past but were stopped this year and could be developed, such as flour milling, oil pressing (processing for the state), transportation, and stone crushing, and has now started operating seven of them. From the start of production on April 20 to May 3, it has already earned more than 3,000 yuan in cash. Including the other five sideline production projects that are about to start production, it is estimated that it will earn an additional 5,600 yuan before the wheat harvest. This has not only solved the livelihood difficulties of some members but has also begun to change the situation of insufficient production funds.

    福建省党政领导机关指示贯彻勤俭办社方针
　　保证农业社社员增加收入
    湖南省沅江县农民利用农闲进行副业生产
    新华社福州6日电　中共福建省委员会和福建省人民委员会在六日联合公布了一项指示，要求各级党政领导机关充分发动群众，大力贯彻执行勤俭办社的方针，保证每个农业生产合作社都能增加生产，最大多数的社员都能增加收入。
    指示规定：各地农业社一方面要发扬民主、开展合理化建议运动，发动社员充分发挥劳动潜力，找寻窍门，增加生产，节约成本；另方面要求严格控制财政和劳动日的支出。指示规定，在今后三、五年内，农业社要坚决不兴建如办公室、礼堂等非生产性的基本建设；对农业社干部的常年固定报酬和一般社干部、社员因社务误工补贴的工分，连同农业社的行政管理费用的支出，小社以不超过全年生产总值的2％为宜，大社以不超过1％为宜；农业社所抽公益金最多不得超过当年实际收入2％，社内举办的文化福利事业的开支，应控制在当年所抽的公益金范围内。对于图书馆、俱乐部的管理工作和邮递员等非农业社生产上支出的劳动，可发动青年积极分子利用劳动空隙时间负责管理和兼任，不得由农业社支付工分。
    指示批判了各地存在的忽视经济作物和副业生产的倾向，要求各地在保证粮食增产的同时，还要加强发展多种经济生产的领导。所有农业社都应该积极开辟副业门路，和供销合作社、国营专业公司之间订立预购、预销、加工、运输等不同形式的结合合同，加强生产计划性，以保证农业社增产、社员增加收入。
    新华社长沙6日电　湖南省沅江县农民利用插秧后的农闲季节，根据当地条件展开了副业生产活动。
    这个县许多过去荒废的内湖沟港，现在已经整理好，植上了莲藕、菱角等水产作物。入夜，大江两岸的水面上闪出点点渔火，农民们趁着鱼苗孵化季节忙着打捞幼苗。
    洞庭红农业社最近几天已经打捞了四十多万尾鱼苗。这个社还饲养了二百七十三头猪，其中有二百头母猪到六月间就可生殖一千四百只猪仔。
    为了对副业生产加强领导和技术指导工作，中共沅江县委员会最近召开了各农业社的副业生产队队长会议，研究了副业生产的问题。沅江县农林水利局正在陆续举办养鸭、养鱼、牲畜防疫和饲养技术训练班，准备训练一千名副业技术员。
    目前，这个县的全部农业生产合作社都根据当地自然条件以及国家和个人的需要，全面地订出了发展副业生产的计划，准备经营三十多种副业。
    据新华社济南6日电　山东省历城县先锋农业生产合作社，为了保证社员增加收入，在最近纠正了只搞农业生产不搞副业的偏向。
    这个社的管理委员会，在四月中旬检查了忽视副业生产的偏向后，对副业生产进行了排队，找到了往年惯有而今年停止并可发展的磨面、榨油（为国家加工）和运输、砸石子等十二种副业生产门路，现在已经经营起七种。从四月二十日开始生产到五月三日，就收入现金三千多元。连同即将开始生产的另五种副业在内，预计在麦收前还将收入五千六百多元。这样，既解决了部分社员的生活困难，又开始改变了生产资金不足的情况。
