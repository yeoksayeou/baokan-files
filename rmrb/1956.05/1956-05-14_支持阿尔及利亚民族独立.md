    "Algeria Day" was initiated by six political parties: the People's Islamic Alliance, the Free Pakistan Party, the Socialist Party, the Islamic Promotion Association, the Islamic League, and the Farmer-Worker Party.
    Thousands of people in Karachi responded to the call of these parties and gathered at Aram Bagh in Karachi that morning. They set off from Aram Bagh and held a large-scale demonstration.
    Demonstrators shouted slogans against French atrocities in Algeria and the United States' supply of munitions to the French army, marched in formation through the main streets of the city, and headed towards the Prime Minister's residence.
    Subsequently, six representatives of the demonstrators met with the Prime Minister and expressed to him the sentiments of the Pakistani people regarding the Algerian liberation movement.
    The Prime Minister assured the representatives that the Pakistani government fully understood the strong sentiments of the people in Pakistan regarding the Algerian situation. He stated that he and his government would do their best to support the just cause of the Algerian people in every possible way.
    Jordanian and Lebanese People Hold Rallies
    Xinhua News Agency: Amman: A mass rally was held in the Jordanian sector of Jerusalem on May 8th to support the national independence movements of the North African Arabs.
    King Hussein of Jordan also attended the rally and spoke at the meeting. He expressed his support for the cause of Arab unity and Arab prosperity.
    The rally was convened by several parties in Jordan. Several thousand people attended. The rally demanded that the Iraqi government withdraw from the Baghdad Pact as a practical means of supporting the national independence of the North African Arabs. The rally also demanded that the Jordanian government accept financial assistance from Arab countries. The rally said that this would help Jordan play a full role in supporting the North African Arabs.
    The rally called on countries participating in the Asian-African Conference to implement the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference on supporting the national independence of North African countries.
    On the same day, tens of thousands of people in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, held demonstrations in support of the national aspirations of the Algerian people. Participants in the parade carried flags of Arab countries and Lebanon, and shouted slogans in support of Algerian national independence.
    France Continues to Strengthen Military Suppression Operations
    Xinhua News Agency, May 13th: Paris: Eight thousand French troops were dispatched to Algeria on the 12th to strengthen military suppression operations against the Algerian people.
    This batch of troops was dispatched after the French government decided on the 9th to send an additional 50,000 troops to Algeria. The day after the French government made this decision, French Governor-General of Algeria Lacoste announced martial law in the Constantine and Bone provinces of eastern Algeria, implementing full military control. Lacoste took this action based on the powers granted to him by the French government in March of this year.
    The news said: Algeria is now entirely in a state of emergency—it's just that martial law has not been promulgated throughout the country—and large concentrations of French troops have been stationed in eastern Algeria for several months. (Attached picture)

    支持阿尔及利亚民族独立
    喀喇蚩举行“阿尔及利亚”日
    新华社喀喇蚩13日电　喀喇蚩五月十一日举行了“阿尔及利亚日”，支持阿尔及利亚人民的民族愿望。
    “阿尔及利亚日”是由人民回教联盟、自由巴基斯坦党、社会党、伊斯兰教促进会、伊斯兰教联盟、农工党这六个政党发起的。
    喀喇蚩成千的人响应这几个政党的号召，这天早晨在喀喇蚩的阿兰巴格集合。他们从阿兰巴格出发，举行了大规模的示威游行。
    示威的人们高呼反对法国在阿尔及利亚的暴行和美国供应法军军火的口号，列队穿过这个城市的主要街道，走向总理的住宅。
    随后，示威者的六个代表会见了总理，并且向他表明了巴基斯坦人民对于阿尔及利亚解放运动的情绪。
    总理向代表们提出保证说：巴基斯坦政府充分了解巴基斯坦国内人民对于阿尔及利亚局势的强烈情绪。他表示，他和他的政府将要尽力以种种办法支持阿尔及利亚人民的正义事业。
    约旦和黎巴嫩人民集会
    新华社讯　安曼消息：耶路撒冷约旦区五月八日举行了一次群众大会，支持北非阿拉伯人的民族独立运动。
    约旦国王侯赛尼也出席了大会，并且在会上讲了话。他表示支持阿拉伯团结和阿拉伯繁荣的事业。
    大会是由约旦的一些党派召开的。到会的共有几千人。大会要求伊拉克政府退出巴格达条约，以作为支持北非阿拉伯人的民族独立的一种实际手段。大会还要求约旦政府接受阿拉伯国家的财政援助。大会说，这将有助于约旦在支持北非阿拉伯人方面起充分的作用。
    大会呼吁参加亚非会议的国家执行亚非会议关于支持北非各国民族独立的决议。
    同一天，黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特成千上万的人举行了示威游行，支持阿尔及利亚人民的民族愿望。参加游行的人拿着阿拉伯国家和黎巴嫩的旗子，并且呼喊支持阿尔及利亚民族独立的口号。
    法国继续加强军事镇压行动
    新华社13日讯　巴黎消息：八千名法国军队在十二日被派驻阿尔及利亚，以加强对阿尔及利亚人民的军事镇压行动。
    这一批军队是在法国政府九日决定再增派五万名军队到阿尔及利亚去以后被调遣的，就在法国政府作出这个决定的第二天，法国驻阿尔及利亚总督拉戈斯特宣布在阿尔及利亚东部君士坦丁省和波尼省戒严，实行全面军事管制。拉戈斯特是根据法国政府在今年三月授予的权力采取这个行动的。
    消息说：阿尔及利亚目前已经全部进入了紧急状态——只不过还没有颁布全境的戒严令而已——大批集中的法国军队已经在东阿尔及利亚驻扎了好几个月。（附图片）
