Xinhua News Agency, New York, 3rd (TASS dispatch): The twenty-first session of the United Nations Economic and Social Council concluded its discussion on the issue of forced labor.

    A report filled with crude fabrications was presented at the Council, slandering that "forced labor" exists in the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and the People's Democracies. These absurd rumors were manufactured by the U.S. government, Chiang Kai-shek elements, and certain non-governmental organizations that have consistently supported the U.S. delegation.

    The U.S. delegation attempted to force the Council to discuss these slanders. In its statements, the U.S. representative made many rude slanders against the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, and the People's Democracies.

    Soviet representative Sobolev exposed this campaign to slander the People's Republic of China and other countries of the socialist camp. He pointed out that the purpose of this movement is to, to some extent, support the bankrupt policy of preventing the People's Republic of China from joining the United Nations, and to obstruct the strong desire of the majority of the world's people for easing international tensions and expanding international cooperation. Sobolev cited many facts to prove that the great Chinese people, who have already broken free from the shackles of colonial oppression, are engaged in free and creative labor. The Soviet representative pointed out that the purpose of the slander campaign against the People's Republic of China and other countries of the socialist camp is also to divert world public opinion and United Nations bodies from the plight of the working people in many capitalist countries.

    He pointed out that forced labor does not exist in the countries of the socialist camp where the people have seized power, but exists in those countries where an economic system of man exploiting man exists. Sobolev said that, for example, in the United States, there are at least seven forms of forced labor: debt bondage, which is often direct enslavement; using the labor of foreign expatriates based on signed contracts, especially the labor of Mexican agricultural workers; exploiting the labor of prisoners in prisons; exploiting the labor of patients in mental hospitals; using court-imposed decrees prohibiting strikes to implement forced labor, etc.

    The attempt by the U.S. representative to launch a slander campaign against the countries of the socialist camp in the Council was not supported by the delegations of other capitalist countries.

    The representatives of Britain, France, the Netherlands, and several other countries confined themselves to supporting the draft resolution of the United States and four other countries, and they spoke vaguely about the need to eliminate forced labor.

    The representatives of Egypt, Indonesia, and some other countries said that they did not think it was correct to use the issue of forced labor in United Nations bodies to make political accusations against individual countries.

    The U.S. delegation, worried that the main provisions of its draft resolution would not be adopted (the content of this provision was to condemn the so-called special forced labor system in the socialist camp countries fabricated by the United States), had to make significant revisions to this provision, including in this provision the condemnation of any form of forced labor.

    The entire five-country proposal was adopted by thirteen votes to two (the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia). Three countries abstained: Indonesia, Egypt, and Yugoslavia. According to the adopted resolution, the issue of forced labor will be submitted to the International Labour Organization for further discussion.

### 苏联代表在经社理事会上就“强迫劳动”问题发言  揭穿美国对社会主义国家的诬蔑

　　苏联代表在经社理事会上就“强迫劳动”问题发言
　　揭穿美国对社会主义国家的诬蔑
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社纽约3日讯：联合国经济及社会理事会第二十一次会议结束了关于强迫劳动问题的讨论。
    在理事会上提出了一个充满着粗糙的捏造的报告，诬蔑中华人民共和国、苏联和人民民主国家中存在着“强迫劳动”。这些无稽谰言是美国政府、蒋介石分子和某些一直支持美国代表团的非政府组织制造出来的。
    美国代表团在理事会中企图强迫理事会讨论这种谰言。美国代表在发言中对中华人民共和国、苏联和人民民主国家进行了许多粗鲁的诬蔑。
    苏联代表索波列夫揭穿了这种对中华人民共和国和社会主义阵营的其他国家进行诬蔑的运动。他指出，这一运动的目的是要在某种程度上支持已经破产的不让中华人民共和国加入联合国的政策，是要阻止世界各国大多数人民对缓和国际紧张局势和扩大国际合作的强烈愿望。索波列夫列举许多事实证明，已经挣脱殖民压迫的枷锁的伟大的中国人民在进行自由的创造性劳动。苏联代表指出，对中华人民共和国和社会主义阵营的其他国家进行诬蔑运动的目的还在于，转移世界舆论和联合国机构对许多资本主义国家中劳动人民的困苦境况的注意。
    他指出，强迫劳动并不存在于人民已经掌握了政权的社会主义阵营国家，而是存在于那些存在着人剥削人的经济制度的国家。索波列夫说，例如，在美国，至少有七种形式的强迫劳动：偿债劳动，常常也就是直接奴役；根据签订的合同利用外国侨民的劳动，特别是利用墨西哥的农业工人的劳动；剥削监狱里犯人的劳动；剥削精神病院里病人的劳动；利用法院制订的禁止罢工的法令实行强迫劳动等等。
    美国代表想在理事会上展开对社会主义阵营国家的诽谤运动的企图，并没有受到其他资本主义国家代表团的支持。
    英国、法国、荷兰和其他若干国家的代表仅限于支持美国等五国决议草案，他们在发言中泛泛地谈到取消强迫劳动的必要性。
    埃及、印度尼西亚和其他一些国家的代表说，他们认为在联合国机构中利用强迫劳动问题来对个别国家进行政治指责是不正确的。
    美国代表团担心自己的决议草案中的主要条款不能获得通过（这个条款的内容是谴责美国捏造出来的所谓在社会主义阵营国家中存在的某种特别的强迫劳动制度），不得不对这项条款进行了重大的修改，在这项条款中列入对任何形式的强迫劳动的谴责。
    整个五国提案以十三票对两票（苏联和捷克斯洛伐克）获得通过。弃权的有三个国家：印度尼西亚、埃及和南斯拉夫。根据通过的决议，强迫劳动问题将提交国际劳工组织进一步讨论。
