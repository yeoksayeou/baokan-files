Select and Retain Summer Harvest Crop Seeds According to Need
Lu Pingdong
    Last winter and this spring, Anhui, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangxi and other provinces imported many broad bean and pea seeds infested with insects from Hubei. These seeds not only mostly failed to germinate, but also served as a medium for spreading insect pests. This spring, the rice seeds that Hubei Province transferred from the Northeast caused the seeds to heat up and reduce quality due to their high moisture content. More than three million kilograms had a low germination rate and weak seedlings. These facts once again prove that relying on large-scale transfer of seeds from other places is often a wasteful endeavor. We must firmly remember this lesson.
    The summer harvest season is approaching, and in order to prevent the above from happening again, all localities must do a good job in selecting and retaining seeds of summer harvest crops.
    It is understood that the agricultural and grain departments of Zhejiang, Guangxi, Hubei, Shandong, Guizhou, Henan and other provinces have made specific arrangements for seed selection and retention and the storage of seeds in specialized counties as early as possible, based on the needs of this year's winter planting area. This practice is very good.
    The summer harvest crops planted by newly built or expanded agricultural cooperatives last winter and this spring are of extremely inconsistent varieties. For the needs of future production, these agricultural cooperatives must select and retain high-purity improved varieties. Every agricultural cooperative should realize that this is the fundamental solution to the seed problem. Many agricultural cooperatives in Hubei Province have specifically established seed selection and retention groups and formulated seed selection operating procedures in this year's summer harvest seed selection work. Before the harvest of the spring crops, the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Chengjia District, Rong County, Sichuan Province, calculated the area that needed to be expanded for the next spring crops, and then selected and retained enough of various spring crops based on actual needs. Agricultural cooperatives in various localities should learn from these practices.

    按照需要选留夏收作物种子
    陆平东
    去冬今春，安徽、湖南、江西、广西等省，曾从湖北调进许多生了虫的蚕豆、豌豆种子。这些种子不仅多数不发芽，而且作了传播虫害的媒介。今年春天，湖北省从东北调来的水稻种子，因为含水量较高，结果种子发热，降低了质量，有三百多万斤发芽率低，秧苗生长瘦弱。这些事实再一次证明，依靠从外地大量调运种子，往往是一种劳民伤财的事情。我们应该牢牢地记住这种教训。
    目前夏收季节就要到了，为了使上述的事情不再发生，各地就必须做好选留夏收作物的种子的工作。
    据了解，浙江、广西、湖北、山东、贵州、河南等省农业部门和粮食部门，都及早地根据今年冬种面积的需要，具体布置了选种留种和各专县储备种子的工作。这种作法是很好的。
    去冬今春新建或扩大的农业合作社所种植的夏收作物，品种极不一致，这些农业合作社为了今后生产的需要，必须选留出纯度高的良种。每个农业合作社都应该认识到，这是解决种子的根本办法。湖北省许多农业合作社在今年夏收选种工作当中，专门建立了选种留种小组，制定了选种的操作规程。四川荣县成佳区先锋农业合作社，在小春作物收获前，就计算了明年小春作物需要扩大的面积，然后根据实际的需要，分别选留了足够需要的各种小春作物良种。各地农业合作社就应该学习这些做法。
