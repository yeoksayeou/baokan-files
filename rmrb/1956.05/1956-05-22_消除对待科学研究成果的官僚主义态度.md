Eliminate Bureaucratic Attitudes Towards Scientific Research Achievements
Bai Lin

    To develop China's scientific undertakings, how much we need the initiative and creative spirit of scientific and technological workers! And the initiative and creative spirit of scientific and technological workers are indeed growing day by day. As long as we adopt the correct attitude and enthusiastically support them, this initiative and creative spirit can be better utilized, bringing greater benefits to the country's scientific undertakings.

    Strangely enough, some units are so indifferent to the creative spirit of scientific and technological workers! For example, when physician Guo Xingsun contributed the research result of manufacturing argon gas to the country, some state organs did not even have the most basic enthusiasm. This cannot help but make people wonder why they are so surprisingly indifferent to the scientific research achievements delivered to their door by the people? It turns out that because there are foreign imports available, they don't need to reach out to test or appraise them, nor do they need to take any responsibility.

    In order to prevent such incidents, the bureaucratic ideology and work style must be completely eliminated.

    There are many kinds of bureaucracy. The characteristic of bureaucracy manifested here is a complete lack of enthusiasm and trust in the wisdom and creativity of scientific and technological workers. --Don't we have imported goods that can be used readily? Why manufacture it ourselves? We have to test it, appraise it, train workers, and manage it, how troublesome! Moreover, will it even be successful? What if problems occur? Therefore, while people acknowledge that Guo Xingsun's argon gas "can already be used for the manufacture of fluorescent lamps" and admit that it is "no different from foreign goods," they finally find other reasons—busy production tasks, not having been tested with a prism, and so on. Having found these reasons, they casually shelve the scientific and technological workers' research results indefinitely. In fact, the reasons they found are untenable: scientific and technological workers want to help the country solve the problem of the source of an important raw material, and get rid of dependence on imported goods in production, but they answer, "Production tasks are busy, and we don't have time to test it." Can this be considered a reason? "It has not been tested with a prism," why don't you help him find a prism for testing? Don't state organs have a responsibility to help and support such research results?

    With the rapid development of socialist construction, scientific and technological workers will inevitably make more and more creations in various fields. Therefore, opposing state organs' bureaucratic attitude towards the initiative and creativity of scientific and technological workers is of particularly serious significance now. After the October Revolution, Lenin wrote: "We must acquire all science, technology, all knowledge, and art. Without these, we cannot build a communist society." Socialism means a much higher labor productivity than capitalism. But without a high level of science and technology, higher labor productivity is impossible. And in order to rapidly develop science and technology, it is necessary to give full play to the initiative and creativity of scientific and technological workers, and to give full play to the wisdom of the broad masses. However, bureaucrats do the opposite. They have no enthusiasm for the creativity and wisdom of scientific and technological workers and the people. Besides blocking the road to scientific development, they will not do anything good.

    For the sake of socialism, for the sake of the country's scientific undertakings, we need to promote the creativity of the people and the scientific and technological circles to a greater extent and depth, in order to accelerate the pace of progress. But bureaucracy seriously hinders the development of this creativity, and sometimes directly stifles and suffocates this creativity. We must pay attention to exposing and correcting bureaucratic behavior at all times and in all places, so that it has nowhere to hide, and clear the obstacles to the development of scientific undertakings.

    消除对待科学研究成果的官僚主义态度
    白林
    为了发展我国的科学事业，我们是多么需要科学技术工作者的积极性和创造精神！而科学技术工作者的积极性和创造精神，确实也在日益增长。只要我们采取正确的态度，热情地支持他们，这种积极性和创造精神就可以得到更好的发挥，给国家的科学事业带来更大的利益。
    奇怪的是，有些单位对待科学技术工作者的创造精神，竟是如此冷淡！例如，当医师郭星孙把制造氩气这样的研究成果贡献给国家的时候，某些国家机关是连起码的热情也没有的。这就不能不使人纳闷，为什么他们对于人民送上门来的科学研究成果竟会这样出奇地冷淡呢？原来是因为有外国进口货可以使用，那种货用不着他们伸手去试验或者鉴定，也用不着他们负任何责任。
    为了杜绝这类事件，必须彻底扫除官僚主义的思想作风。
    官僚主义有好些种。这里所表现的官僚主义的特点，是对科学技术工作者的智慧和创造能力完全缺乏热情，缺乏信任。——我们不是有进口货可以现成使用么？为什么要自己制造呢？又得试验，又得鉴定，又得训练工人，又得经营管理，那有多麻烦呀！而且，那准能成么？发生了问题怎办呢？所以，人们一方面承认郭星孙的氩气“已能适用莹光灯之制造”，承认它“和外国货没有两样”，却终于找到了另外一些理由——生产任务繁忙啦，没有经过三棱镜鉴定啦，诸如此类。找到了这些理由，也就随随便便地把科学技术工作者的研究成果无限期地搁置起来不问。其实，他们找到的理由是不能成立的：科学技术工作者要来帮助国家解决一种重要原料的来源问题，摆脱在生产上对于进口货的依赖，而他们回答道：“生产任务繁忙，无暇试验”，这能算作理由么？“没有经过三棱镜鉴定”，你为什么不帮助他弄三棱镜来鉴定呢？国家机关对于这样的研究成果难道没有帮助和支持的责任么？
    随着社会主义建设事业的迅速发展，科学技术工作者在各方面的创造必将愈来愈多，所以，反对国家机关以官僚主义态度对待科学技术工作者的积极性和创造性，在现在来说，就有特别严重的意义，列宁在十月革命以后写道：“必须取得一切科学、技术，一切知识、艺术。没有这些我们就不可能建成共产主义社会底生活。”社会主义，意味着比资本主义更高得多的劳动生产率。但是如果没有高度的科学技术水平，更高的劳动生产率就是不可能的。而为了迅速发展科学技术，就需要充分发挥科学技术工作者的积极性和创造性，充分发挥广大群众的智慧。但是，官僚主义者却相反，他们对科学技术工作者和人民群众的创造性和智慧没有任何热情，除了阻塞科学发展的道路以外，他们是不会做出什么好事情来的。
    为了社会主义，为了国家的科学事业，我们需要在更大范围内和更深的程度上发扬人民群众和科学技术界的创造性，来加速前进的步伐。但官僚主义严重妨害着这种创造性的发挥，有时候是直接地扼杀和窒息了这种创造性。我们必须随时随地注意揭发和纠正官僚主义的行为，叫它无地藏身，给科学事业的发展扫清障碍。
