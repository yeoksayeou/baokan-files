Phnom Penh Dispatch:

    U.S. "Aid" in Cambodia
    Bei Que Di
    American economic "aid" to Cambodia is, in fact, intended to include Cambodia in America's various pockets. Before resigning as Prime Minister, Sihanouk said at a press conference: "For a long time, we have been unable to access American aid. The money is dangled in front of us, but we cannot touch it... Some of us say that this is not aid at all. We pay for everything we get ourselves." Shortly after resigning, Sihanouk further criticized: "The United States only dumps luxury goods on us."
    In Phnom Penh, every morning I have breakfast at the Davallem Restaurant, a comfortable little café attached to the Postal Grand Hotel on Postal Square. Outside, new, shiny 1956 model American cars with shark-tooth-like protrusions in the front and back stream by. From the tables under the awning in the doorway, you can see the market stalls, piled high with Cambodia's abundant oranges, pineapples, pumpkins, melons, and dozens of other fruits. The mountains of fresh oranges and pineapples aroused the desire to drink a fresh orange or pineapple juice during the morning coffee break. But when it was served, it was a whole can, a can of American canned goods, filled with flowery words extolling the virtues of California orange or pineapple juice. A country capable of exporting fruit to half the world is forced to use precious foreign exchange to import American juice!
    According to figures released by the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh, total dollar aid amounted to $39.5 million from July 1, 1954, to March 1, 1956. Of this, transportation costs accounted for a staggering 12.4%. American shipping companies carrying California juice and ice cream, and soda water received $5 million. Textiles accounted for 21.6%, cars and tires, gasoline accounted for 14.3%, food and medicine 14%, cement 10%, and machinery, motors, parts, engines, etc. accounted for 27.8%. The proportion accounted for by automobiles and maintenance costs actually far exceeded 14.3%, because I was told that many of these items were imported under the guise of machinery, parts, etc. Orange juice and other canned foods are disguised as "various agricultural products accounting for 5.5%" in the U.S. Embassy figures.
    These imports can be said to be of no use to the reconstruction of the country—with the possible exception of cement, which could be supplied from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on much more reasonable terms. Cambodia hopes to use American economic "aid" to achieve genuine national independence. But all it gets are American cars, oranges, and American or Japanese textiles.
    Cambodia asked the United States to build a railway to connect the planned new port of Kompong Som with the interior, so that it could truly be independent of its neighbors, because Cambodia's trade routes currently have to pass through the territories of these countries. The Americans refused on the absurd grounds of "strategic" danger, claiming that the railway could be used by an "aggressor from the sea." But the Americans have found a "strategic" use for building a railway connecting Thailand and Cambodia.
    During my stay in Phnom Penh, there was a particularly ironic example of how the Americans were basely trying to influence the Buddhists. An American came to Phnom Penh and announced that after careful consideration, he had decided to become a monk. His head was duly shaved, a solemn ceremony was held, he put on the saffron robe, and was accepted as a Buddhist disciple. Two weeks later, he put on his American traveler's clothes again, reverted to a secular "prodigal," and then his name appeared as a "Cambodian expert" in a startling news report from Bangkok on April 2nd: "United Press correspondent, Robert Balza, just spent two weeks in the Buddhist order." Buddhists, who take their religious beliefs and vows seriously, were outraged by this despicable fraud.
    The U.S. "aid" figures quoted above do not tell the whole story. Figures recently obtained by the Cambodian government show that about 40% of the dollars provided by the United States are stored abroad, which is simply a direct robbery of the Cambodian treasury. "We asked the U.S. government to pay the money directly to our national bank," Sihanouk told reporters, "but they never let us touch it."
    Dollars are deposited in a special fund entirely controlled by the Americans. In theory, a Cambodian importer can submit a request to import items to a special U.S. "aid" administration staffed by Cambodians, and request that dollars be allocated to pay for the imported goods. But U.S. officials review each application, approving some and rejecting others. Applications that have a chance of being approved by the Cambodian U.S. "aid" administration are only those that import consumer goods and are of no use to the construction of Cambodia.
    These "aid" dollars are not a real gift. It is only a "convenience" in foreign exchange. Because the Cambodian government must enter an equivalent amount in the Cambodian account of the "counterpart fund" according to the full selling price of goods worth $10,000. They also have to pay the 40% that is trapped abroad, which is $4,000. The price of these goods includes customs duties, which account for a large proportion of Cambodia's revenue. The price of imported goods from the "counterpart fund"—including customs duties—pays for the activities of Americans in Cambodia, including the extravagant lives of U.S. "aid" officials and technical advisors and the cost of military "aid" to the Cambodian army.
    Since most imports are paid for by U.S. "aid," the budget is almost completely deprived of customs revenue. In fact, customs duties are used to repay the generous "aid" that the Americans boast about. This is precisely why Sihanouk said at a press conference attended by U.S. intelligence officials: "Some of us say that this is the time for me to leave Phnom Penh, the Cambodian treasury is actually empty—it has all been transferred to the 'counterpart fund' to pay for those unnecessary orange juice and cars, to pay for those unnecessary and unnecessary American activities in Cambodia."
    When Cambodia began to doubt whether all of this was appropriate, and looked elsewhere for genuine aid to enable it to develop its own rich wealth and achieve genuine independence, the answer was to impose an economic blockade on it. The Sihanouk government protested against this blatant pressure by resigning. As I write this, a Cambodian delegation is leaving for Beijing, where there is aid based on equality and mutual benefit.

    美国“援助”在柬埔寨
    贝却敌
    美国人对柬埔寨提供经济“援助”，事实上为的是想把柬埔寨囊括到美国的形形式式的口袋里去。西哈努克在辞去首相职务以前举行的一个记者招待会上说：“很久以来我们不能问津美援。金元在我们面前晃来晃去，但是我们摸不着它……我们当中有人说，这压根儿就不是援助。我们自己支付我们所得到的一切。”在辞职之后不久，西哈努克又批评说：“美国光向我们倾销奢侈品。”
    在金边，每日早晨我总是在达瓦廉餐室吃早点，这是一家附属在邮政广场上的邮政大酒店的舒适的小咖啡馆。外面川流不息地驶过新亮的前后突出像鲨鱼齿似的1956年式的美国汽车。从摆在门庭的篷布下的桌子上，可以望得到市集上的小摊，上面堆满了柬埔寨盛产的橙子、波萝、番瓜、甜瓜和数十种其他水果。堆积如山的鲜橙子和波萝，引起了想在早晨吃咖啡的时光喝上一杯鲜橙汁或波萝汁的欲望。但是当端上来时，却是整罐的，一听美国罐头，上面写满了歌颂加利福尼亚的橙汁或波萝汁的优点的华丽词句。一个能够向半个世界出口水果的国家，却不得不用珍贵的外币来输入美国的果汁！
    根据在金边的美国大使馆所公布的数字，从1954年7月1日起到1956年3月1日止，美元援助总数达三千九百五十万美元。这当中，运输费用惊人地占了12.4％。运载加利福尼亚果汁和冰淇淋、苏打水的美国轮船公司得到五百万美元。纺织品占了21.6％，汽车和轮胎、汽油达14.3％，食品与药品14％，水泥10％，机械装备、马达、零件、发动机等等占27.8％。汽车和保养费所占的比重实际上远远超过14.3％，因为有人告诉我，这方面的东西有许多是在机械设备、零件等等名目下输入的。橙汁和其他罐头食品，在美国大使馆的数字中，被乔装成“各种农产品占5.5％。”
    这些输入可说是对这个国家的重建一点用处也没有——水泥可能例外，这些东西可以根据合理得多的条件从越南民主共和国得到供应。柬埔寨希望借助于美国的经济“援助”，使国家得到真正的独立。但是它得到的只是美国轿车、橙子和美国的或是日本的纺织品。
    柬埔寨要求美国为其修建一条铁路，把计划中的磅逊新港和内地连接起来，以使自己能够真正不倚赖邻人，因为目前柬埔寨的贸易孔道须经过这些国家的领土。美国人却以荒谬的“战略上”危险的理由拒绝了。说什么这条铁路可能被一个“从海上来的侵略者”利用。但是美国人却发现修筑一条连接泰国和柬埔寨的铁路有“战略上的”用场。
    在我逗留金边的时间里，发生过一个关于美国人是如何卑鄙地企图影响佛教徒的最讽刺性的典型例子。一个美国人来到了金边，宣布说他经过仔细的考虑之后，已决定剃度入教。他的头按规矩被剃光了，举行了一个庄严的仪式，他披上了番红色的袈裟，被接纳为佛门弟子。两个礼拜之后，他重新穿上了美国旅行家的服装，回复为一个世俗的“浪子”，之后他的名字作为柬埔寨问题“专家”出现在四月二日曼谷的惊人新闻中：“合众社特派记者，罗伯特·巴尔扎，刚在佛门中渡过了两个星期。”虔诚看待自己的宗教信仰和誓言的佛教徒，对这个卑鄙的骗子感到愤怒。
    上面所引述的美“援”数字丝毫不能说明全部情况。柬埔寨政府最近所掌握的数字表明，美国所提供的美元中的40％左右贮藏在国外，这简直是对柬埔寨财库的直接打劫。“我们要求美国政府把款子直接付给我们的国家银行”，西哈努克对记者们说，“但是他们从不让我们碰它。”
    美元存入一笔完全由美国人控制的特别基金内。在理论上，一个柬埔寨入口商可以向一个特设的由柬埔寨人担任职员的美“援”管理局提出要输入的项目，并要求拨给美元支付入口的货品。但是美国官员审查每一个申请，批准了一些申请和撤销其他一些申请。有机会获得柬埔寨美“援”管理局批准的申请，只能是那些输入消费品而对建设柬埔寨并无用处的申请。
    这些“援助”的美元并非真正的馈赠。它只是一种外汇上的“方便”而已。因为柬埔寨政府必须按照值一万美元的货物的全部售价，在“对等基金”的柬埔寨账上进入同等的一笔款项。他们还得支付被套存在国外的40％，也就是四千美元。这些货物的价款包括了关税，而关税在柬埔寨的岁入中本来占着很大的比重。就是从“对等基金”里的进口货的价款——包括了关税，支付着在柬埔寨的美国人的活动费，包括了美“援”官长和技术顾问的靡费生活和美国供应柬埔寨军队的军事“援助”等费用。
    由于绝大部分输入是由美“援”支付的，预算里几乎完全被剥夺了关税收入。事实上关税是用来偿还了美国人所大吹特吹的慷慨“援助”。正因为如此，才使得西哈努克在一个有美国情报官员在场的记者招待会上说：“在我们当中有人说，这是我离开金边的时候了，柬埔寨的国库实际上已空空如也——它全部转移到了‘对等基金’上，支付那些不需要的橙汁和小汽车，支付在柬埔寨的那些不需要和不必要的美国活动。”
    当柬埔寨开始对这一切是否合适表示怀疑，并且向他处寻找真正的援助，使它能够开发自己的富庶的财富和得到真正的独立的时候，回答却是对它实行经济封锁。西哈努克政府以辞职来抗议这种蛮横的压力。在我写本文的时候，一个柬埔寨代表团正在动身到北京去，在那儿有基于平等和互利的援助。
