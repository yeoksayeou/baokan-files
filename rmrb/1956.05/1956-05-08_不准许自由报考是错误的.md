　　It is wrong not to allow free application
　　To the Editor:
    I am a staff member of the Anyang Office of the China Native Produce Company, Anyang Branch. When I saw the news in the newspaper that cadres currently employed could freely apply for universities this year, I excitedly decided to apply.
    However, my wish has not been realized because I was blocked by the leaders in my office. Around April 10th, the Anyang Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education issued a notice on encouraging cadres currently employed to apply for universities and ensuring time for candidates to review their lessons. The leaders in the office, fearing that others would know, silently put it in a drawer. I raised the issue of preparing for the application with the leaders. At that time, Director Li Shishun said, "Your qualifications are up to par, but you have to wait for the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education to approve it. First, fill out a form and let our Party branch study it."
    A week passed, and there was still no news of allowing me to apply. I went to the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education to inquire. They said, "We don't have any approval procedures here." I told Director Li about this situation, and he still said he would ask the Bureau of Culture and Education. On the 24th, the three directors of the office talked to me together. They gave three reasons for not allowing me to apply. The first reason was that there was no guarantee of being admitted, the second was that my lungs had had problems in the past, and the last was that the office was busy and could not spare time for me to review my lessons. At that time, I explained that my lungs had recovered, and I had a physical examination certificate, and I asked them to allow me to apply. Who knew, Director Li became angry and said, "No is no!" I asked if it was the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education that did not approve it, or if the office disagreed. He said, "It's our office that doesn't allow it, so what!" I pointed out that free application was an instruction from the State Council, and the office work could also be done without me, and they should not stop me from applying. At this time, Director Wang Hanqing also became angry and said, "Based on your level, you are qualified to apply, but you are not diligent at work, you don't study hard, and you like to go home to sleep at night. This is the reason why we won't let you apply!" I felt that these reasons were very strange and expressed my own opinions. Director Wang stood up and said, "Your desire to go to school is entirely out of a desire for fame and status. If you have any opinions, we will immediately convene a meeting of all cadres to help you!"
    Thus, I still cannot apply to universities. Li Zhonglin

　　不准许自由报考是错误的
　　编辑同志：
    我是中国土产公司安阳支公司安阳市土产办事处的工作人员。当我在报纸上看到今年在职干部可以自由报考高等学校的消息后，我就兴奋地决定去报考。
    可是，我的愿望却因为受到处里领导同志的阻拦而到现在还没有实现。四月十日前后，安阳市文教局发下了一个关于鼓励在职干部投考高等学校和保证考生温习功课时间的通知，处里的领导同志生怕别人知道，就不声不响地把它放在抽屉里。我向领导同志提出准备报考。当时李世顺主任说：“你条件倒合格，不过得等市文教局批一下。你先填一个表，让我们党支部研究研究。”
    一星期过去了，仍然没有允许我报考的消息。我到市文教局去询问。他们说：“我们这里没有什么批准手续。”我把这个情况告诉李主任，他仍然说要问一下文教局。二十四日，处里三位主任一起找我谈话，他们举出三个理由，不让我报考。第一个理由是不一定有把握被录取，第二是我的肺部过去有过毛病，最后是处里工作忙，不能抽时间让我温习功课。当时我说明我的肺部已经复原，有体格检查证明，并且要求他们允许我去报考。谁知道，李主任就发火了，他说：“不行就是不行！”我问是市文教局不批准，还是处里不同意。他说：“是咱们处里不行，又怎么呢！”我提出自由报考是国务院的指示，处里工作也能离得开，不应当阻拦我去报考。这时，王汉卿主任也火了，他说：“根据你的程度是可以报考的，就是你工作时不紧张，学习不钻研，夜间好回家睡觉，这就是不叫你去报考的理由！”我觉得这些理由很奇怪，又提出自己的意见，王主任就站起来说：“你要考学校完全是一种名誉地位思想。你有意见，咱们马上召集一个全体干部大会来帮助帮助你！”
    就这样，我到现在还不能去报考高等学校。  李中林
