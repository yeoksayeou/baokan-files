The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League conferred the title of "Liaoning Provincial Youth Socialist Construction Activist" on twenty-one young people, including Chen Jizhi, who actively advance towards science and culture, on the eve of the "May Fourth" Youth Day.

　　Chen Jizhi is a graduate student at the Institute of Metal Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The problem he researched on saving manganese consumption in open-hearth steelmaking has now been successfully tested. Li Fengyun, a female lathe operator at the Fushun Laohutai Mine, was illiterate six years ago. Over the past few years, she has persisted in her spare-time cultural studies and has now reached a high school education level. Chen Mao of the Electric Power Laboratory of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has only had eight years of schooling, but has persisted in cultural and technical studies for the past six years. He has now reached a cultural level equivalent to that of a university, and has transformed from an apprentice to a technician in terms of technical skills.

　　奖励积极向科学文化进军的青年
    青年团辽宁省委员会在“五四”青年节前夕授予陈继志等二十一名积极向科学文化进军的青年以“辽宁省青年社会主义建设积极分子”的称号。
    陈继志是中国科学院金属研究所的研究生，他所研究的平炉炼钢节省锰的消耗量问题，现在已经试验成功。抚顺老虎台矿女车工李凤云六年前还是个文盲，几年来她坚持业余文化学习，现在已经达到高中的文化程度。鞍山钢铁公司电力试验所的陈茂，只念过八年书，六年来一直坚持文化和技术学习，现在已经达到相当于大学的文化程度，在技术上已经由徒工变成了技术员。
