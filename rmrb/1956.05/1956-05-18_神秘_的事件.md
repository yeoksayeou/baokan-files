    The “Mysterious” Incident

    During the visit of Soviet leaders to Britain, a British diver appeared near two Soviet warships docked in Portsmouth. The British government has apologized to the Soviet government for this. However, the matter of the missing British diver named Crabb has caused a great uproar in Britain. "The Times" reported on May 5th about the course of this diver's mysterious incident.

    According to "The Times," on April 16th or 17th, one or two days before the Soviet leaders arrived in Britain, a person checked into the Sally Port Hotel in Portsmouth, registering under the name Crabb. Soon after, someone who knew Crabb also checked into the same hotel, registering under the name Smith. Both of them only carried light luggage.

    After two nights, on the morning of April 18th or 19th, both of them left the hotel. Later that day, Smith returned to pay the bill for both of them.

    On April 21st, Detective Superintendent Lambert of the Portsmouth Police Department, on the order of Police Chief West, removed several pages from the Sally Port Hotel's guest register, including those days. At the same time, he warned the hotel staff not to talk about this matter.

    On April 29th, after inquiries from the press, naval authorities said that Crabb may have died on April 19th while testing new diving equipment. Naval authorities said that Crabb was a civilian and had been specially hired. The test site was said to be in Stokes Bay, three miles outside Portsmouth Harbour. However, the Torpedo and Anti-Submarine School in Portsmouth, which is responsible for training divers, knew nothing about this test. Moreover, "The Times" forgot to point out that the British naval authorities also did not explain why Crabb would reappear inside Portsmouth Harbour.

    "The Times" asked whether this matter was related to the Soviet warships that arrived in Portsmouth Harbour on April 18th. Why did the police authorities remove several pages from the guest register, giving the whole matter an air of conspiracy, and also creating a mysterious person named Smith?

    The British naval authorities refused to comment on this matter. However, since the facts are as such, comments are probably superfluous.

    “神秘”的事件
    在苏联领袖访问英国期间，停泊在朴次茅斯的两艘苏联军舰附近曾经出现了一名英国潜水员。英国政府已经为此向苏联政府道歉。但是关于这个失踪了的名叫克莱布的英国潜水员的事情，在英国却闹得满城风雨。“泰晤士报”在五月五日报道了关于这个潜水员的神秘事件的经过情形。
    据“泰晤士报”说，在四月十六日或十七日，也就是苏联领袖到英国以前一两天，有一个人到朴次茅斯的萨莱泡特旅馆去住宿，登记簿上写的名字是克莱布。不久之后，有一个和克莱布认识的人也到这家旅馆去住宿，登记的名字是斯密斯。两人都只带了轻便的行李。
    过了两夜之后，在十八日或十九日早上，这两个人都离开了旅馆。这天较晚的时候，斯密斯回来付了两个人的账。
    四月二十一日，朴次茅斯警察厅的侦探长兰泡特，奉警察厅长威斯特之命，去掉了萨莱泡特旅馆旅客登记簿中包括这几天的几页。同时他警告旅馆人员不要谈论这件事情。
    四月二十九日，在报界询问之后，海军当局说克莱布在四月十九日在试验一种新的潜水装备时可能已经死亡。海军当局说，克莱布是平民，他是被特地雇用来的。试验的地点据说在朴次茅斯港外三英里的斯特罗克斯海湾。但是，关于这次试验，在朴次茅斯的一所负责训练潜水员的鱼雷反潜艇学校却竟然完全不知道。而且，“泰晤士报”忘了指出，英国海军当局也没有说明为什么克莱布竟又会在朴次茅斯港内出现。
    “泰晤士报”问道，这件事情同在四月十八日到达朴次茅斯港的苏联军舰是不是有关系呢？为什么警察当局要去掉旅客登记簿上的几页，给整个事情一种阴谋诡计的味道，并且还弄出一个名叫斯密斯的神秘的人来呢？
    英国海军当局拒绝对这件事发表评论。但是，事实既是如此，评论大概是多余的了。
