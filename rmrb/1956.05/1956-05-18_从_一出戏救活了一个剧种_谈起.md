    Starting from "One Play Revived a Genre"

    "One play revived a genre." This statement was made by some comrades in the theatrical circles in response to the performance of Kunqu Opera's "Fifteen Strings of Cash" in the capital. Originally, the rise and fall of a genre should not be determined by one play. However, the performance of "Fifteen Strings of Cash" has given this statement a basis, which shows that there are indeed problems in our opera work.

    Kunqu Opera's "Fifteen Strings of Cash" has rich popularity, relatively high ideological content, and artistry. It is an excellent achievement in Chinese opera art. As Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out yesterday at the Kunqu Opera "Fifteen Strings of Cash" symposium: "'Fifteen Strings of Cash' not only brings out the new brilliance of classical Kunqu art, but also shows that historical dramas can also play a good role in realistic education, so that people pay more attention to the excellent traditions of national art. It has set a good example for further implementing the policy of 'Let a hundred flowers bloom and weed through the old to bring forth the new.'"

    However, before this, we also heard some arguments: a certain local opera genre has no prospects for development; a certain local opera genre should be left to fend for itself. If such opinions come from the general audience, it is only a matter of the interests and tastes of a few people and a lack of knowledge. However, such opinions have also come from some people who are responsible for leading opera work, which cannot but be surprising.

    Regarding Kunqu Opera, there has indeed been such an argument, as if there is nothing "new" to "bring forth" except to learn some dance movements or basic performance techniques. In the minds of those who hold these arguments, the fate of Kunqu Opera is destined to be submerged. Because the era of being active on the "red carpet" has naturally passed, and only a few people can appreciate the elegant lyrics. However, when making such a judgment, have they conducted in-depth and detailed investigations and researches on this genre? Have they even made a brief foray into the traditional repertoire of Kunqu Opera? More importantly, have they consulted with Kunqu Opera artists and listened to their opinions, and worked with them to carry out the reform of this genre?

    What we see is that quite a few modern and overly stubborn people are "observing the expressions" and "trying to figure out." They make decisions easily based only on the interests and tastes of a few people, based only on subjective assumptions and some impressions from years ago, and treat this as the basis and direction for developing and supporting a certain local opera genre. As a result, a few words and a stroke of the pen, this stroke is not trivial, a genre with a long history has been suppressed for several years after liberation.

    The sensational success of the Zhejiang Kunsu Opera Troupe in Shanghai and Beijing, and the grand occasion of "the whole city is talking about Fifteen Strings of Cash" has not only given a resounding answer to the modern and overly stubborn people, but also raised serious questions to the opera reform work in recent years and to the cultural authorities in charge of leading the opera reform work: In the era of "let a hundred flowers bloom," are there still many flowers that have been neglected and have not been able to bloom brilliantly? While supporting and developing many local opera genres, have we also suppressed and buried some local opera genres?

    Of course, no one will deny the achievements of opera reform work in recent years. However, the appearance of Kunqu Opera's "Fifteen Strings of Cash" has provided a test for our opera reform work. It is said that the national local opera genres and artists have not yet been fully accurately counted and investigated. How many artistic treasures are hidden in this, waiting for us to discover! Then, the fate of those genres that are still very unfamiliar to us is very worrying. It is hoped that every genre that has not yet received attention will not have to wait until performing a play in Beijing to be "revived" in the future.

### 从“一出戏救活了一个剧种”谈起

    从“一出戏救活了一个剧种”谈起
    “一出戏救活了一个剧种”，这句话是戏剧界一些同志有感于昆曲“十五贯”在首都演出后的情况而发的。本来，一个剧种的兴亡衰替，决不应该决定于一出戏，然而“十五贯”的演出，竟然使这句话有了根据，这就看出我们的戏曲工作中确实存在着问题了。
  　昆曲“十五贯”的丰富的人民性、相当高的思想性和艺术性，是我国戏曲艺术中的优异的成就。正如周恩来总理昨天在昆曲“十五贯”座谈会上所指出的：“十五贯”不仅使古典的昆曲艺术放出新的光彩，而且说明了历史剧同样可以很好地起现实的教育作用，使人们更加重视民族艺术的优良传统，为进一步贯彻执行‘百花齐放、推陈出新’的方针，树立了良好的榜样。”
    但是，在这以前，我们也曾经听到过这样一些论调：某一个地方剧种没有什么发展前途；某一个地方剧种只好让它自生自灭。诸如此类的意见，如果是出自一般观众之口，那也还只是少数人的兴趣口味和知识不足的问题；可是，这样的意见，却也曾经出自一些对领导戏曲工作负有责任的人之口，这就不能不令人感到奇怪了。
    对于昆曲，就确实有过这种论调，似乎除了向它学习一些舞蹈身段或表演的基本技术训练之外，就没有什么“新”可“出”了。在持这些论调的人的心目中，昆曲的命运是注定了要湮没的。因为活跃在“红毡毹上”的时代，自然早过去了，典雅的唱词，也只有少数人才能欣赏。可是，下这样的判断的时候，他们有没有对这个剧种作过深入的、细致的调查研究呢？有没有到昆曲的传统剧目中去即使是略作涉猎呢？更重要的是，有没有同昆曲的艺人们商量过并且倾听他们的意见、同他们一起动手来进行本剧种的改革工作呢？
    我们看到的，是为数不少的现代的过于执们的“察言观色”和“揣摩猜测”。他们只凭少数人的兴趣和口味，只凭主观臆测和一些若干年前的印象，就轻易地作出决定，并且把这当作发展、扶植某一地方剧种的依据和方针。结果，三言两语，就信笔一挥，这一挥不打紧，一个具有悠久历史的剧种在解放后就被压抑了好几年。
    浙江省昆苏剧团轰动上海、轰动北京，“满城争说十五贯”的盛况，不仅给了现代的过于执们一个响亮的回答，也向这几年来的戏曲改革工作、向领导戏曲改革工作的文化主管部门，提出了严重的问题：在“百花齐放”的时候，是不是还有不少的花被冷落了，没有能灿烂地开放？在扶植和发展了不少地方剧种的时候，是不是同时也压抑和埋没了一些地方剧种？
    自然，任何人决不会抹杀这几年来戏曲改革工作的成就。可是，昆曲“十五贯”的出现，却为我们的戏曲改革工作作了一次检验。据说，全国的地方剧种和艺人至今还没有完全精确的统计和调查，这中间，蕴藏着多少的艺术珍宝，亟待我们去发掘啊！那么，那些对于我们还很生疏的剧种的命运，也就十分令人牵挂了。希望每一个还没有受到重视的剧种，今后不再要等到来北京演上一出戏以后，才能“救活”。
