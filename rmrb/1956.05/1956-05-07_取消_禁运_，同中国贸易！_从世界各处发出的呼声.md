　　Abolish the "Embargo", Trade with China!
　　--Voices from All Over the World--
　　Thai newspapers believe that direct trade between Thailand and China will have good results
　　The Thai newspaper "Honor" published an editorial on the 2nd, advocating that the Thai government should openly carry out trade between Thailand and China for the exchange of goods, and it also advocated that Thai and Chinese merchants should have direct contact. The editorial said, "This will not only not cause any losses, but on the contrary, it will have good results, that is, the government will have the opportunity to easily implement policies to reduce the cost of living." The editorial demanded that the Thai government should give more consideration to the interests of the broad masses of the people.
　　The Thai "Eternity" newspaper published an editorial on April 30, advocating the establishment of trade relations with China. The editorial said that China has a population of over 600 million, and if China buys Thai goods, the already shrinking Thai market will be greatly expanded. Thailand's economy will also be restored in the near future as a result. Countries such as Japan, Ceylon, and Egypt, which do not have diplomatic relations with China, have negotiated with China and signed trade agreements. The editorial asked, why doesn't Thailand negotiate with China? (According to Xinhua News Agency)
　　Chairman of the Eastern Committee of German Industry said
　　The current embargo list is outdated
　　According to German newspapers: Otto Wolff, chairman of the Eastern Committee of German Industry, said at the Hanover Industrial Fair on April 28 that the current list of embargoed goods to China is outdated. He believes that China can obtain "embargoed items" from socialist countries. Wolff added: "The embargo on China is based on the situation in 1950, but we are currently living in 1956. Changes have taken place since then." A meeting in Coventry, England, passed a resolution stating that expanding trade with China would help stabilize the British economy.
　　London's "Workers' Daily" reported that on April 29, a meeting on trade with China was held in Coventry, attended by representatives from the Labor Party, the Cooperative Party, the Communist Party, trade unions, and workshops. The resolution passed at the meeting called on the government to take all steps to expand trade with China and abolish the ban on trade. The resolution said that doing so would help promote Britain's economic stability and lasting peace between the British and Chinese people.
　　The meeting, jointly convened by the trade union representatives' meeting and the Coventry City Labor Party organization, also called on Coventry to establish friendly ties with a Chinese city and requested the City Council to convene a city-wide meeting to discuss trade with China.
　　The Mayor of Coventry presided over the opening of the meeting. Representatives from the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires in the United Kingdom were also invited to attend the meeting.
　　Indonesian newspapers say
　　The "embargo" is most damaging to Indonesia
　　The Indonesian "Republic" newspaper said on May 5 that the embargo on China is outdated and abnormal. It is an obstacle to Indonesia's independent foreign policy, which aims at world peace.
　　The newspaper said that as a rubber-producing country, the "embargo" policy is most damaging to Indonesia. The newspaper pointed out that this policy was adopted by the United Nations under pressure from the United States. When rubber prices in the Western world continue to fall, the "embargo" has blocked another huge rubber consumption market.
　　"East Star" newspaper said that the painful fact is that the United States insists on imposing an embargo on China, while at the same time, as Eisenhower stated in his recent statement to the US Congress, the United States is no longer the main buyer of natural rubber.
　　The newspaper called for expanding the rubber market to save the Indonesian rubber crisis.
　　According to Antara News Agency reported on May 4, Jakarta rubber merchants believe that Eisenhower's April 30 speech on the production of synthetic rubber is another effort to further depress rubber prices in the world market. They said that for Indonesian rubber producers and rubber research institutions, Eisenhower's statement can be regarded as a warning sign. They also demanded to seek other rubber markets and try to lift the "embargo" as a way out of the current predicament.

　　取消“禁运”，同中国贸易！
    ——从世界各处发出的呼声——
    泰国报纸认为中泰直接贸易会有良好结果
    泰国的“荣誉报”二日发表社论，主张泰国政府应当公开地开展泰国和中国彼此间交换货物的贸易，它还主张公开由泰中两国商人进行直接的接触。社论说，“这不仅不会有什么损失，相反，还会有良好的结果，那就是政府将有机会容易地来实行降低生活费用的政策”。社论要求泰国政府应当更多地考虑到广大人民的利益。
    泰国“永恒报”四月三十日发表社论主张同中国建立贸易关系。社论说，中国有六亿以上的人口，如果中国购买泰国的商品，那么已经缩小了的泰国市场就将大大地扩展。泰国的经济也将因此在最近的将来获得恢复。同中国并没有外交关系的日本、锡兰和埃及等国都同中国进行了谈判，并且签订了贸易协定。社论问道，为什么泰国不去同中国谈判呢？　（据新华社讯）
    西德工业东方委员会主席说
　　目前的禁运货物单是过时的
    据西德报纸报道：西德工业东方委员会主席奥托·沃尔夫四月二十八日在汉诺威工业博览会上说，目前的对中国禁运的货物单是过时的。他认为，中国能够从社会主义国家得到“禁运物品”。沃尔夫又说：“对中国禁运是根据1950年的情况，但是我们目前生活在1956年。从那时以来，已经发生了变化”。英考文垂市举行集会通过决议说扩大对华贸易有助于英经济稳定
    伦敦“工人日报”报道，四月二十九日在考文垂举行了一个有工党，合作党和共产党、工会以及车间的代表参加的讨论同中国贸易问题的会议，会议在通过的决议中要求政府采取一切步骤来扩大同中国的贸易和取消禁止贸易的规定。决议说，这样做会有助于促进英国的经济稳定，促进英中两国人民之间的持久和平。
    这个由工会代表会和考文垂市工党组织联合召开的会议，还要求考文垂和一个中国城市建立友谊联系，并且要求市议会召开一次全市集会，讨论同中国贸易的问题。
    考文垂市长主持会议开幕。中国驻英国代办处的代表也应邀参加了会议。
    印度尼西亚报纸说
    “禁运”对印度尼西亚损害最大
    印度尼西亚的“共和国报”五月五日说，对中国的禁运是过时的和不正常的。这是印度尼西亚执行它的目的在于世界和平的独立的外交政策的障碍。
    这家报纸说，作为一个出产橡胶的国家，“禁运”政策对印度尼西亚的损害最大。报纸指出，这种政策是联合国在美国压力下采取的。当西方世界的橡胶价格不断下跌的时候，“禁运”却封锁了另一个巨大的橡胶消费市场。
    “东星报”说，令人痛心的事实是：美国坚持对中国实施禁运，而同时，如同艾森豪威尔在最近向美国国会发表的声明中所表示的那样，美国却不再作天然橡胶的主要买主了。
    这家报纸要求扩大橡胶市场以挽救印度尼西亚橡胶的危机。
    据安塔拉通讯社五月四日报道，雅加达的橡胶商认为，艾森豪威尔四月三十日发表的关于生产人造橡胶的演说是要进一步压低世界市场的橡胶价格的又一个努力。他们说，对于印度尼西亚的橡胶生产者和橡胶研究机构来说，可以把艾森豪威尔的声明当作一个警号。他们并且要求寻求其他橡胶市场和设法取消“禁运”，以作为摆脱目前处境的一条出路。
