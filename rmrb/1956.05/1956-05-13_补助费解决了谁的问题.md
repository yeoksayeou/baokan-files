To the Editor:

    The North China Workers' Hospital, affiliated with the Ministry of Construction Engineering, received 1,070 yuan in employee welfare subsidies from the higher authorities in the fourth quarter of last year. Who did this money subsidize? Hospital Director Zhao Delin received 120 yuan, Deputy Director Feng Jinsheng 150 yuan, Office Director Li Guiyu 120 yuan, General Affairs Section Chief Zhao Xiaowei 80 yuan, and Personnel Cadre Hou Kungang 90 yuan. Of these five people, except for Hou Kungang who should have received a small subsidy, the others did not need a subsidy at all. However, they took more than half of this subsidy.

    Who decided on these five people receiving subsidies? They did! After the subsidies were allocated, Director Zhao Delin and others asked Hou Kungang to take all the money from the accounting office, and then they divided it among themselves. On the day they received the subsidies, the hospital was originally scheduled to hold an important meeting, but because these five people were eager to use their "subsidies," the meeting was canceled. The five of them went to the department store together. Zhao Delin bought several pairs of woolen pants, Li Guiyu bought a leather coat for his mother-in-law, and Hou Kungang and the others bought suitcases. Zhao Delin said to everyone with satisfaction, "The welfare fees in the third quarter were controlled too strictly. This time, some problems have been solved for everyone!" However, he did not think that while they "solved their problems," the comrades in the hospital who were truly living in hardship could not receive the subsidies they deserved.

    The hospital's superior leadership at the time, the North China Engineering Management Bureau, discovered this situation and immediately ordered Zhao Delin and others to conduct a self-criticism and make an explanation to the masses; however, the hospital's leadership delayed making a self-criticism. Now that the hospital is directly under the leadership of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the problem has still not been resolved. Therefore, I suggest that the Ministry of Construction Engineering quickly send someone to deal with this issue. Yao Shunchang

### 补助费解决了谁的问题

    补助费解决了谁的问题编辑同志：
    建筑工程部所属华北职工医院在去年第四季度拿到上级拨下的职工福利补助费1，070元。这笔钱补助了哪些人呢？院长赵德林一百二十元，副院长冯金声一百五十元，办公室主任李桂玉一百二十元，总务科科长赵晓伟八十元，人事干部侯昆岗九十元。这五个人中，除了侯昆岗应该稍予补助外，其他人全是不需要补助的。但是他们就拿走了这次补助费的一半以上。
    这五个人拿补助费是由谁评定的呢？就是他们自己！当补助费拨下以后，院长赵德林等叫侯昆岗把全部款项都从会计处拿出来，然后就自己分起来了。在他们拿到补助费的那天，医院里本来准备召开一个重要会议，因为这五个人急于使用他们拿到的“补助费”，于是会议也不开了。他们五个人一块到百货大楼，赵德林买了几条呢裤子，李桂玉给他岳母买了一件皮衣，侯昆岗等几个人都买了皮箱。赵德林很满意地对大家说：“第三季度的福利费掌握得太严啦。这次可给大家解决了一些问题！”但是，他却不想想，他们“解决了问题”，医院里真正生活困难的同志就不能得到应有的补助了。
    这个医院当时的上级领导机关——华北工程管理总局发现了这个情况后，立即责令赵德林等进行检查，并且向群众做出交代；但是这个医院的领导人员拖延不作检查。现在这个医院已经由建筑工程部直接领导了，问题仍然没有得到处理。因此，我建议建筑工程部迅速派人来处理这个问题。　姚顺昌
