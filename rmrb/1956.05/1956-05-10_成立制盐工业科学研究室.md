Xinhua News Agency report:

    The Scientific Research Laboratory for the Salt Industry, established by the Salt Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry in the Tanggu area of the Changlu Salt District, has recently been established and has begun scientific research work.

    During the first phase (approximately two years) of its work, this scientific research laboratory will focus on studying issues such as brine production, salt drying, and soil improvement of salt fields in the sea salt production process. It will also conduct scientific assessments of various advanced experiences in different sea salt producing areas, elevate them to a scientific level, in order to change the backward state of salt production technology in China. After the implementation of these research projects, the production level of China's four major sea salt producing areas will be greatly improved, and the quality of salt can be made basically clean and reduce the dampness in the rainy season.

    成立制盐工业科学研究室
    轻工业部盐务总局设在长芦盐区塘沽地区的制盐工业科学研究室在最近成立，开始进行科学研究工作。
    这个科学研究室在第一期（约二年）的工作期间中，将着重研究海盐生产过程中制卤、晒盐、改良盐地土壤等方面的问题，并且对各海盐产区的各种先进经验进行科学鉴定、提高到科学水平，以改变中国盐业生产技术落后的状况。这些项目研究实现以后，将使中国四大海盐产区的生产水平大大提高，并且可以使盐质基本洁净和减少在雨季中的潮湿现象。
