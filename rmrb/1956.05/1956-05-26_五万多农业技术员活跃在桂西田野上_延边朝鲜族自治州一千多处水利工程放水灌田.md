Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, May 24th: In the season when corn is flowering and budding, more than 50,000 agricultural technicians are active in the fields of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture, carrying out corn detasseling and artificial pollination. In the past week or so, nine counties in the corn-producing areas, including Chongzuo and Longjin, have adopted this advanced agricultural production technology on more than 427,000 mu of corn. According to surveys, detasseling and artificial pollination of corn can increase production by about 20 to 30 jin per mu.

From last winter to April this year, the Autonomous Prefecture has successively trained 150,000 agricultural technicians from various ethnic groups, including Zhuang, Han, Miao, and Yao. Now, each agricultural cooperative has an average of a dozen agricultural technician backbone members, who are responsible for the technical reform work of their cooperative.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, May 24th: More than 1,000 small-scale water conservancy projects built by agricultural production cooperatives in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin Province, have successively begun to release water for irrigation.

Farmers of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Prefecture plan to expand the area of paddy fields by 10,000 hectares ten days before Grain in Ear (June 6th). These paddy fields account for one-third of the original paddy field area. After the plan is realized, it is estimated that rice production will increase by more than 30,000 tons this year.

Since the high tide of the cooperativization movement last autumn, farmers of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Prefecture have begun to build water conservancy projects. In the plains, almost every township and cooperative has newly built small-scale water conservancy projects and expanded the area of paddy fields.

    五万多农业技术员活跃在桂西田野上
    延边朝鲜族自治州一千多处水利工程放水灌田
    据新华社南宁24日电　在玉米扬花含苞的季节里，五万多名农业技术员活跃在桂西僮族自治州的田野上，进行玉米去雄、人工授粉。最近一个多星期，玉米产区的崇左、龙津等九个县，已有四十二万七千多亩玉米采用了这种先进农业生产技术。根据调查，实行玉米去雄、人工授粉，每亩约可多产二十斤到三十斤玉米。
    自治州从去年冬季到今年四月，已经先后训练出十五万名僮、汉、苗、瑶等各民族农业技术员。现在，每个农业社平均都有十几名农业技术员骨干分子，担负起本社的技术改革工作。
    据新华社长春24日电　吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州农业生产合作社兴修的一千多处小型水利工程，已经相继开始放水灌田。
    自治州各族农民今年要在芒种（六月六日）前十天实现扩大一万公顷水田面积的计划。这些水田，占到原有水田面积三分之一。计划实现后，今年约可增产三万多吨稻谷。
    自治州各族农民从去年秋季合作化运动高潮以来就开始兴修水利工程，平原地区差不多每乡、每社都新修了小型水利工程和扩大了水田面积。
