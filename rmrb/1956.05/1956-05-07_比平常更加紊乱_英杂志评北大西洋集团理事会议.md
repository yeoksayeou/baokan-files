Xinhua News Agency, London, May 5th. According to TASS, British magazines commented on the NATO Council meeting held in Paris, pointing out that the bloc is facing a serious crisis.

　　The "New Statesman and Nation" wrote: "The NATO meeting was held in an atmosphere of more chaos and intense argument than usual. Since the establishment of NATO, it is the first time that Western experts have had serious differences of opinion on the purpose, methods and future of the organization. These arguments are not the result of friction between allies, but are due to the increasingly strong realization that NATO is an error of an era, a crude and ugly mammoth that has survived the ice age of the Cold War."

　　"Western leaders have successively recognized this. Mollet last month called for the removal of the military corset that restricts the West's view of international issues. A week earlier, Eden signed a document that included the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In doing so, he abandoned the fruitless Western position taken at the foreign ministers' meeting last autumn, which was that issuing statements on common principles without reaching agreement on specific issues was 'misleading' and dangerous. This time, Eden agreed to the Russian basic argument: that failure to reach agreement on certain issues does not preclude the possibility of a gradual easing of tensions on many other issues."

　　The article also said: If Dulles continues to interpret Russian diplomacy from a Cold War perspective, then he must beware of becoming isolated. "The United States should understand that the West can only guarantee its security in an era of peaceful competition by modifying its Cold War policies and modifying them as deftly as the Soviet Union has adopted a new policy approach."

　　The conservative "Spectator" also published an editorial pointing out that the NATO meeting was characterized by serious divisions between two factions, one advocating a change in the nature of NATO in light of the changing political situation as a whole, and the other, mainly American politicians, still advocating the policies of a military bloc. The magazine believes that the dissatisfaction of NATO's European member states with the heavy burden of armaments is the main reason for the increasing friction within the organization. The magazine also said that the embargo on the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries has caused greater losses to Europe than to the United States, which often leads to "genuine conflicts of objectives" between many Europeans and Americans in NATO.

　　The "Spectator" worriedly said that there are also divisions within Europe itself. For example, Britain and West Germany have conflicts over the cost of maintaining British troops stationed in Germany. Centrifugal forces have already manifested themselves, and it is difficult to reduce friction.

### “比平常更加紊乱”  英杂志评北大西洋集团理事会议

   “比平常更加紊乱”
　　英杂志评北大西洋集团理事会议
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国杂志在评论在巴黎举行的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议时，指出这个集团面临严重危机。
    “新政治家与民族”周刊写道：“北大西洋公约组织的会议是在比平常更加紊乱和激烈争吵的气氛中举行的。从北大西洋公约组织成立以来，西方专家们对这个组织的目的、方式和未来发生严重的分歧意见，还是第一次。这些争吵不是盟国间摩擦的结果，而是由于日益强烈地意识到了北大西洋公约组织是一个时代的错误、是一只度过了冷战的冰河时期的粗野丑恶的古象。”
    “西方国家的领袖相继承认这一点。摩勒在上个月号召脱下限制着西方在国际问题上的视界的军事紧身衣。一周以前，艾登在包括了著名的五项共处原则的文件上签了字。这样他就是放弃了去年秋天外长会议上所采取的不能导致成果的西方立场，这种立场就是，如果没有就具体问题达成协议，发表关于共同原则的声明是‘会导入迷途的’，并且是危险的，艾登这次同意了俄国的这一种基本论点：不能就某些问题达成协议并不排斥在许多其他问题上逐渐缓和紧张局势的可能性”。
    这篇文章还说：如果杜勒斯继续从冷战的角度来解释俄国的外交，那末，他就得要提防走向孤立。“美国应当懂得，西方只有修改冷战政策，而且要作像苏联采取新政策方针那样机敏地修改，才能在和平竞赛的时代中保障安全”。
    保守的“旁观者”周刊也发表社论指出，北大西洋集团这次会议的特点是，两派人之间发生严重的分歧，一派人鉴于整个政治局势的改变而主张改变北大西洋公约组织的性质，而另一派人，主要是美国的政治人物，仍旧主张军事集团的政策。这家周刊认为，北大西洋公约组织的欧洲成员国对沉重的军备负担的不满，是这个组织内部摩擦日益加强的主要原因。这家周刊还说，对苏联和东欧国家实行禁运给欧洲带来的损失比美国要大，这时常使许多欧洲人和美国人在北大西洋公约组织中发生“目标上的真正冲突”。
    “旁观者”忧虑地说，在欧洲本身也存在着分歧。例如，英国和西德在维持驻德的英国军队的费用的问题上就有冲突。离心力已经表现出来，要做到减少摩擦是困难的。
