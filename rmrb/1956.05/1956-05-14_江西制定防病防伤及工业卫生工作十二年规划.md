Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, May 13th: A mining silicosis investigation team composed of eight units including the Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the Jiangxi Provincial Health Department departed from Nanchang on the 12th to conduct investigations in the southern Jiangxi mining area and other places.

This investigation team is working according to the Jiangxi Province's Twelve-Year Plan for Disease Prevention, Injury Prevention, and Industrial Hygiene Work, which was formulated by the Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the Jiangxi Provincial Health Department in late April. This plan requires the basic elimination of eleven diseases among employees throughout the province within two to twelve years, including silicosis, occupational rheumatism, and trichomonal vaginitis. The plan decides to make the active prevention and treatment of silicosis the key work for 1956, and to basically eliminate this highly harmful occupational disease within seven years. The plan also requires the establishment of women's health rooms in factories with more than 100 employees this year, and the implementation of a menstrual card registration system.
