Farmers in the Jianghan Plain are actively draining waterlogged fields to protect seedlings.

Recently, the Jianghan Plain has experienced continuous heavy rains, causing waterlogging in low-lying farmland along the river and lake areas, as well as in some mountainous regions. Party and government leaders at all levels are actively leading farmers in a struggle to drain the water and protect the seedlings. Farmers in various locations, under the slogan "Machines don't rest, even if people do," are working day and night to operate waterwheels to drain the waterlogged fields. Finance, trade, and grain departments, as well as supply and marketing cooperatives, are actively transporting goods to the countryside to ensure the supply of grain, seeds, and other necessities to the farmers.

Currently, the water has been drained from the vast majority of the waterlogged farmland on the plain. In these fields, the early rice and cotton have generally turned green again. Farmers have promptly replanted and transplanted seedlings in some of the fields where they were destroyed by flooding, ensuring that all fields are fully planted. At the same time, farmers are continuing their efforts to drain the remaining water from the low-lying areas near the lake into the rivers, lakes, and channels. (Our correspondent in Wuhan)

    江汉平原农民积极排渍保苗
    近来江汉平原连日大雨，以致沿江滨湖的低洼农田和部分山区受渍。各地党政领导积极领导农民展开了排渍保苗的斗争。各地农民在“歇人不歇车”的口号下，日夜不停地车水排渍。各地财经、粮食部门和供销合作社都积极运货下乡，保证对农民粮食、种子等的供应。
    现在平原上绝大部分受渍的农田，渍水已经排除。这些农田中的早稻和棉花一般都已经返青；部分被淹毁的禾苗，农民及时补种移栽，保证全苗。同时农民还在继续努力，把湖边洼地最后的渍水排进江、湖和河道里去。　（本报驻武汉记者）
