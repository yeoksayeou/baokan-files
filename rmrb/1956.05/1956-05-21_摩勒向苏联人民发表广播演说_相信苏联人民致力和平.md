Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th: According to TASS, French Prime Minister Mollet said on the evening of the 19th: When I left Paris to come to the Soviet Union, I already believed that the Soviet people were committed to peace. My talks with the Soviet leaders not long ago only confirmed this opinion. Now, as I leave Moscow, I believe that from now on it is possible to end the tragic isolation between nations and to organize peace.

Mollet made these remarks in a speech broadcast on Moscow television, accompanied by French Foreign Minister Pineau and others.

Mollet went on to say that isolation cannot but breed distrust, because people cannot escape fear in solitude and seclusion. It is this fear that gave rise to the Cold War. Today, the obstacles that once separated us are beginning to disappear. Let us not dwell on the past or assign blame, but let us look to the future and take advantage of the opportunities we have. The future – that is the unanimous desire for peace that exists throughout the world. There is no longer any danger, no threat of aggression. I hope that you share my feeling and that everyone believes that war is fatal to all.

An ardent desire for understanding and comprehension is inspiring everyone. The French people want to understand your lives sincerely and friendly. They are tired of distorted propaganda. They are seeking the truth. Although my visit to Moscow has been short, I am convinced that I have learned that the same desire is inspiring you as well.

Of course, there are differences in systems, organizations, and ideologies. But this should not harm harmony and friendship. Moreover, harmony and friendship can be strengthened through honest comparison of views. Efforts should be made to make this friendly comparison, and the Soviet and French governments will make this effort to expand various ties between the two countries.

Mollet added that the French people long for the freest, most direct, most frank, and most sincere contact between them and you. I can assure you that the French people will promote this in the spirit of the broadest understanding and friendship. They admire your achievements and understand the justified pride you have.

Mollet said that before returning to Paris, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to our Soviet hosts for their warm reception. You can be sure that when we return to France, we will not forget the warm reception from the residents of Moscow, whose sincerity deeply moved us and will be highly appreciated by the French people.

Finally, I want to say to you that I am convinced that this visit will help consolidate friendship and world peace.

    摩勒向苏联人民发表广播演说
    相信苏联人民致力和平
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：法国总理摩勒十九日晚上说：我在离开巴黎动身到苏联来的时候，就已经相信苏联人民是致力于和平的。不久前我同苏联领导人进行的会谈只不过是证实了我的这个意见。现在，当我离开莫斯科的时候，我相信从现在起有了可能来结束各民族之间的悲剧性的隔绝状态，有可能组织和平了。
    摩勒是在莫斯科电视播送台发表的一篇演说中讲到这番话的。和他同去的还有法国外交部长比诺等人。
    摩勒接着说，孤立不可能不产生不信任，因为各国人民在孤独和闭塞的情况下不可能摆脱恐惧。正是这种害怕情绪产生了冷战。今天，曾经把我们分隔开来的障碍正在开始消失。我们不要去回想过去，追究责任，我们应当面向将来，利用我们得到的各种可能性。未来——这就是在世界各地存在的对和平的一致愿望。现在已经不存在危险，不存在侵略威胁了。我希望你们和我有同感，大家都同样相信，战争对所有的人都是致命的。
    希望了解和谅解的热切愿望在鼓舞着所有的人。法国人民希望真诚和友好地了解你们的生活。他们对歪曲的宣传感到厌倦了。他们在寻求真理。虽然我来莫斯科访问的时间很短，不过我深信，我了解到同样的愿望也在鼓舞着你们。
    当然，在制度、组织、观念形态方面存在着分歧。但是这不应该损害和睦和友谊。而且，由于诚实地比较观点，和睦和友谊可以得到巩固。应当努力作这种友好的比较，苏法两国政府将作出这种努力以扩大两国之间的各种联系。
    摩勒又说，法国人民渴望，他们和你们之间有最自由的、最直接的、最坦率的和最诚恳的接触。我可以向你们保证，法国人民将本着最广泛了解和友好的精神来促进这一点。他们对你们的成就感到钦佩，了解你们所具有的合乎情理的自豪。
    摩勒说，在回巴黎以前，我要衷心地感谢我们的苏联主人给我们这样热烈的招待。你们可以相信，我们在回到法国以后，将不会忘记莫斯科居民怀着率直态度来参加的这一次招待，这种率直态度使我们深受感动，并且将博得法国人民的崇高评价。
    最后我要对你们说，我深信这次访问将有助于巩固友谊和世界和平。
