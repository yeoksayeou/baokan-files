		A Novel Interpretation of Divorce
		An American sociologist named Lundes recently created a "theory" using Mendel's laws of inheritance to explain the widespread phenomenon of divorce in the United States.
		This sociologist claims that, based on his survey of two thousand college students, he has concluded that divorce is hereditary.
		He said: "If grandparents or great-grandparents have divorced, their descendants' chances of divorce increase by 23.7%. If both grandparents and great-grandparents' generations have divorced, 38% of their descendants will divorce or separate."
		By this logic: Theft is hereditary; ignorance is hereditary… Amitabha, so all of this has "nothing to do" with the decadent capitalist system itself!

		A New Product of the American Way of Life
		One of the newest products of the American way of life is the ten-year-old stock market expert.
		Ross, a ten-year-old child from California, recently won a prize of $100,000 in a stock market question-and-answer competition program held by the American "National Broadcasting Company." In addition, the New York Stock Exchange also gave him stocks worth $2,500 as a reward for Ross's "promotional work."
		This little expert, from the age of seven, was specially studying books on Wall Street financial issues under the cultivation of his father, who is an accountant. American monopoly capital clearly welcomes and is willing to encourage this direction of children's "education."

		"The More One Says, the More Mistakes One Makes"
		U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Allen is currently traveling to Africa. At a closed-door meeting of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on May 8, Allen stated that the United States must intervene in African affairs, using the method of "assisting the development" of independent African countries, and must "cooperate" with U.S. allies in "recognizing the wishes of the people of dependent countries for independence and development."
		"The more one says, the more mistakes one makes." Allen, if he were smarter, should have stopped right there.
		However, he went on to say, "Apart from the desire to assist the African people, this region is also rich in important materials such as uranium, diamonds, rubber, and industrial metals."

		The Honest Words of an American Congressman
		U.S. officials always try to blame the tense situation in the Near East on the Soviet Union. However, at a meeting of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee on May 8, Congressman Moulder told the truth.
		He admitted that it was not others, but the American diplomatic personnel stationed in the Middle East, who were "provoking" the "explosive dispute" between Israel and Arab countries. He named Ivan White, the counselor of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel, as one of the main provocateurs. White has been advocating for Israel to launch a so-called "preventive war."
		Moulder asked, "Where did this talk of a preventive war come from?" He answered himself, "It came from our embassy—from American officials."

    离婚新解
    一位美国的社会学家伦得斯最近创立了一种“理论”，用孟德尔遗传定律来解释美国离婚普遍的现象。
    这位社会学家自称根据他对二千个大学生进行调查的结果得出一个结论：离婚是有遗传性的。
    他说：“如果祖父母或外祖父母离过婚，他的后一代的离婚机会就增加23.7％。如果祖父母和外祖父母这一代都离过婚，他的后一代的儿女就有38％会离婚或分居。”
    以此类推：盗窃，是有遗传性的；愚昧，是有遗传性的……。阿弥陀佛，原来这一切都和腐朽的资本主义制度本身“无关”！
    美国生活方式的新产品
    美国生活方式的最新产品之一是十岁的股票专家。
    加利福尼亚州十岁儿童罗斯，最近在美国“全国广播公司”举办的股票问题答问比赛节目中，获得了十万美元的奖金。此外，纽约股票交易所还赠给他价值二千五百美元的股票，作为对罗斯“宣传工作”的酬谢。
    这位小专家从七岁起，就在当会计师的父亲培养下，专门研读有关华尔街金融问题的书籍。美国垄断资本显然欢迎并且愿意鼓励这种儿童“教育”的方向。
    “言多必失”
    美国助理国务卿艾伦现在正在到非洲去旅行。在五月八日美国参议院外交委员会的一次秘密会议上，艾伦曾经表示，美国必须插手到非洲事务中去，用的方法是“协助发展”非洲的独立国家，并且要在“承认附属国人民要求独立和发展的愿望”方面同美国盟国“合作”。
    “言多必失”。艾伦如果聪明一些，就应该说到这里就立刻打住。
    但是，他接着又说，“且不谈要协助非洲人民的愿望，这个地区还盛产铀、钻石、橡胶和工业用金属之类的重要物资。”
    美国议员的老实话
    美国官方总是把近东局势紧张的原因硬推在苏联身上。但是，在五月八日美国众议院外交委员会会议上，众议员穆尔特却说了老实话。
    他承认：“挑动”以色列和阿拉伯国家之间的“爆炸性的争端”的不是别人，而是美国驻中东的外交人员。他有名有姓地指出，主要的挑动者之一是美国驻以色列特拉维夫的大使馆参赞伊凡·怀特。怀特一直鼓吹要以色列发动所谓“预防性的战争”。
    穆尔特问，“这种预防性的战争的说法是那里来的？”他自己回答说，“是从我们的大使馆——美国官员那里来的。”
