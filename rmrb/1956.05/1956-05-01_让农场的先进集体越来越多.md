Let More Advanced Collectives Emerge in Farms
Zhao Wei, Tractor Driver, Friendship State Farm

In early 1955, I was transferred from the Lutai State Farm to the Friendship Farm to cultivate a large area of wasteland. Last year, our contract team completed 2,513.78 hectares of cultivation work, exceeding the planned workload by 91.53%, and saved the state 2,789.4 kilograms of fuel, earning the honorary title of "Advanced Vehicle Team."

Our contract team consists of six comrades, who come from different parts of the country and different work positions. The deputy driver, Comrade Liu Huan'gao, was a third-year student at the Agricultural Mechanization School affiliated to Northeast Agricultural College; the assistant, Sun Qingtian, used to study as a fitter at the Shuangqiao Tractor Repair Factory; the implement operators Su Jianlin and Zhao Xueqin are veterans from Jiangsu; and Liu Jinxiang is a farm worker group leader from Handan Farm in Hebei. Our origins and experiences are different, and our living habits also vary greatly. None of us were accustomed to the severe cold of the Great Northern Wilderness, nor did we have experience in cultivating large areas of wasteland, but the glorious responsibility of building the "Anshan of agriculture" inspired us, and the noble qualities of Soviet experts who were not afraid of hardship and were enthusiastically responsible infected us. The six of us, urged each other, helped each other, cared for each other, and were as close as brothers. In this way, we had the strength to overcome all difficulties.

When we first arrived at the Friendship Farm, there were no houses. Some people lived in camping vehicles, and some could only live in tents. It was too cold at night, so comrades with more quilts took them out and shared them. Comrades who were resting often prepared warm stoves and hot water for washing for the comrades who were working. We built our own ball field and gathered the books that everyone brought to establish a small library. When we couldn't work, we studied culture and technology together. Comrade Liu Huan'gao found paper to draw mechanical diagrams to explain the theory of tractor construction to the comrades. I shared my practical experience and helped everyone improve their skills.

Among us, some people complained about not being used to eating sorghum rice and corn kernels, or not being able to withstand the cold of the Great Northern Wilderness. Whenever this happened, we gathered together to talk about the construction of the motherland from our own experiences and encourage each other. For example, I participated in the construction of the Lutai Farm in 1949. I talked about how the floods threatened Lutai at that time, how difficult life was, and we only had some surplus materials received from the Kuomintang—a few dilapidated small horsepower tractors that couldn't even turn over the turf. But in just a few years, the Lutai Farm has developed greatly. Now, our Friendship Farm has the latest and best Soviet agricultural machinery equipment, and we have the specific help of many excellent Soviet experts. We will definitely be able to build the Great Northern Wilderness into a magnificent and prosperous agricultural city in the shortest possible time. Whenever we talked about these things, we gained confidence and strength. Comrade Liu Huan'gao, the deputy driver, could write articles and poems, and he often wrote articles and poems to encourage everyone. For example, on the first day we arrived at the construction site, it was almost evening, and we were temporarily building a stove to cook. The wind was strong in the field, and the rice was never cooked thoroughly. He wrote an article entitled "The First Meal on the Prairie," vividly describing the combat experience of that night. Everyone read this article, and even eating undercooked rice in the howling wilderness felt extra sweet.

We encountered even more difficulties in our work. For example, when harrowing before land reclamation, the endless wild grass in the field made it impossible to see the route. When working at night, we had to send someone to run on the ground to lead the tractor. The ground was full of earth mounds and tree roots, often causing people to fall. Wolves often appeared in the grass. After running all night, we were covered in sweat, and the cold wind made us shiver. Later, everyone researched the "large-area double-pass gang harrowing" method to solve this difficulty, and the harrowing area increased from 40-50 hectares per shift in the past to more than 90 hectares, while also ensuring quality. Also, during the land reclamation period, our vehicle only had one five-share plow, and the center of resistance was difficult to find. The plowshare was often blocked by turf and tree roots. For several days in a row, we could not meet the work quota, and the quality was also poor. We stood on the plow all day studying ways to overcome plow blockage. Each of us worked hard to find the problems we could discover and worked together to make more than ten adjustments, finally gaining experience, overcoming difficulties, and increasing the efficiency of land reclamation from three or four hectares per shift to more than nine hectares, exceeding the quota by more than 60%, and completing the task ahead of schedule.

Another reason we were able to achieve results was the conscientious implementation of Soviet experts' suggestions. During the spring wheat sowing period, because we were using new tractors and were not familiar with their performance, a C-80 tractor pulling four 48-row seeders could only travel in second gear, and could only sow 40-50 hectares per day, which did not meet the quota. Soviet expert Comrade Stanko helped us remove the horsepower restriction pin, and immediately assembled five seeders to work with third gear traction. The maximum workload reached 102 hectares, exceeding the quota by 70%. In the first stubble mulching work after land reclamation, the furrow slices were large and there were many plow furrows, making it easy for the stubble mulcher to enter the furrow. If we pulled it hard, it would deform the beam. We promptly implemented the Soviet experts' suggestion to install the small plow beam horizontally, and the work went smoothly.

Before May 1st, I represented the comrades of our contract team to come to Beijing to participate in the National Conference of Advanced Agricultural and Water Conservancy Producers. At the meeting, I exchanged work experience with many comrades, visited the performances of advanced Soviet producers, and learned a lot. I am determined to work harder and be a worthy outstanding tractor driver of New China. All comrades in our group are determined to consolidate our existing achievements, do a good job in unity, further promote the glory of the advanced collective, and work hard to help other groups, so that more and more advanced collectives emerge in our farm.

    让农场的先进集体越来越多
    国营友谊农场拖拉机驾驶员　赵未
    1955年年初，我从国营芦台农场调到友谊农场开垦大面积荒地。去年一年我们包车组完成了2，513.78公顷耕作任务，超过计划工作量91.53％，并为国家节约了2，789.4公斤油料，取得了“先进机车”的光荣称号。
    我们包车组的六个同志，来自祖国不同的地方，不同的工作岗位。副驾驶员刘焕高同志，过去是东北农学院附设农业机械化学校三年级的学生；助手孙青田，过去在双桥拖拉机修配厂学习钳工；农具手苏建林和赵学勤是从江苏来的转业军人，刘金祥是河北邯郸农场的农工组长。我们的出身、经历各不相同，生活习惯也有很大差异。我们都不习惯北大荒的严寒，也没有大面积开垦荒地的经验，但是建设“农业上的鞍钢”的光荣职责鼓舞着我们，苏联专家们不怕艰苦、热情负责的崇高品质感染着我们，我们六个人，互相督促，互相帮助，互相关怀，亲密得像亲兄弟一样，这样，我们就有了克服一切困难的力量。
    我们刚到友谊农场的时候，没有房子，一部分人住在宿营车里，一部分人只能住在帐篷里面，晚上太冷，被子多的同志，就把被子拿出来，大家合用。休息的同志经常给工作的同志们预备好温暖的炉火和洗脸的热水。我们自己建立起球场，还把大家带来的书集中起来建立一个小型图书馆，不能工作的时候，就在一起学习文化和技术。刘焕高同志就找出纸来画机械图给同志们讲解拖拉机构造的理论。我向大家介绍实际操作的经验，帮助大家提高技术。
    我们中间，也有人因吃不惯高粱米和棒子粒的饭，或经受不了北大荒的寒冷叫过苦。每当这样的时候，我们就集聚在一起，从自己的经历中谈祖国的建设，互相鼓励。例如我参加过1949年芦台农场建场斗争，我就讲那时候，洪水怎样威胁着芦台，生活怎样艰苦，我们只有一些从国民党接收来的剩余物资——几台连草皮都翻不过来的破破烂烂的小马力拖拉机。但是没有几年工夫，芦台农场有了很大的发展。现在，我们的友谊农场拥有最新式最优良的苏联农业机械装备，有很多优秀的苏联专家的具体帮助，我们一定能在最短期间，把北大荒建设成一个雄伟、富饶的农业城市。一谈到这些，我们就有了信心，有了力量。副驾驶员刘焕高同志会写文章和诗，他常常写文章和诗来鼓舞大家。例如，我们到达工地的第一天，天已近晚，临时砌灶做饭，野外风大，饭总做不熟，他就以“草原上的第一餐饭”为题，写了一篇文章，生动地描写了这一晚的战斗经历，大家读了这篇文章，在北风怒号的荒野上，吃着夹生的饭，也感到格外的香甜。
    我们在工作中遇到的困难更多。譬如，在开荒以前耙地的时候，地里没人的荒草望不到边，看不清路线。在夜间工作的时候，我们只好派一个人在地下跑，给拖拉机领路。地下到处是土包、树根，经常把人摔倒。草丛里还常有野狼出没。跑上一夜浑身是汗，冷风一吹，又冻得发抖。后来大家研究出“大区双遍套耙”方法，才解决这个困难，并且从过去每个班耙地四、五十公顷提高到九十公顷以上，还保证了质量。又如在开荒期间，我们的机车，只有一台五铧犁，阻力中心不好找，犁铧又经常被草皮、树根堵塞，一连几天，都达不到工作定额，质量也差。我们整天站在犁上研究克服堵犁的办法。我们每个人都努力找出自己能发现的问题，共同动手作了十多次调整，终于获得了经验，克服了困难，使每班开荒的效率从三、四公顷提高到九公顷多，超过定额60％以上，提前完成了任务。
    我们能够取得成绩的另一原因，是认真贯彻执行苏联专家的建议。在春播小麦期间，我们由于用的是新拖拉机，不熟悉它的性能，一台C—80拖拉机牵引四台四十八行播种机，只能用二速行驶，一天只能播种四、五十公顷，达不到定额。苏联专家史丹靠同志就帮助我们拔掉马力限制钉，马上编组五台播种机，用三速牵引工作，最高工作量就达到102公顷，超过定额70％，开荒后第一遍灭茬工作中。垡片大，犁沟多，灭茬器容易进到垅沟里，如果硬拉，就会使大梁变形，我们及时执行了苏联专家的意见，把小犁梁横过来安装，工作就很顺利地进行了。
    “五一”节以前，我代表我们包车组的同志们到北京来参加全国农业水利先进生产者代表会议，在会上和许多同志们交流了工作上的经验，参观了苏联先进生产者的表演，学习到不少东西。我决心加倍努力，做一个名符其实的新中国优秀的拖拉机手。我们全组的同志都决心巩固已有的成绩，做好团结工作，进一步发扬先进集体的光荣，并努力帮助别的组，让我们农场的先进集体越来越多。
