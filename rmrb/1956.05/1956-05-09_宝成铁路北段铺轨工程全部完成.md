The track-laying project for the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, which starts from Baoji and stretches 110 kilometers through the Qinling Mountains and crosses the Jialing River seven times, was fully completed on April 30th.

　　The southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway reached a point 478 kilometers away from Chengdu on May 6th. Now, only about 90 kilometers of the entire Baoji-Chengdu Railway remain to be laid.

　　In order to complete the track-laying task ahead of schedule, the track-laying and bridge-building workers in the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway launched a heated socialist emulation drive. The Pan Ruohai work team of the bridge-building detachment set a new national record by erecting a 16-meter span reinforced concrete T-beam bridge in one hour and fifty-eight minutes. The Lin Chengbo work team originally took half an hour to unload a wagon of steel rails, but after the competition started, they continuously improved the unloading method and increased the speed to unloading a wagon in five minutes, which effectively ensured the rapid progress of the track-laying project.

　　宝成铁路北段铺轨工程全部完成
    从宝鸡起全长一百一十公里，穿过秦岭、七跨嘉陵江的宝成铁路北段铺轨工程已经在四月三十日全部完工。
    宝成铁路南段，在五月六日铺轨到距成都478公里处。现在宝成铁路全线还没有铺轨的只剩下九十公里左右了。
    宝成铁路北段铺轨架桥的工人为了提前完成铺轨任务，曾经展开了热烈的社会主义竞赛。架桥分队潘若海工班，以一小时五十八分钟架了一孔十六公尺跨度的钢筋混凝土丁字桥梁，创造了全国新纪录。林成柏工班原来半个小时才能卸完一车钢轨，从竞赛展开以后，他们不断改进卸车方法，提高到五分钟就卸完一车，有力地保证了铺轨工程迅速进展。（新华社）
