The Business Ideology of "I'm Indispensable" Is Undesirable
By Our Correspondent Fang Qing

The Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory (hereinafter referred to as Factory A) receives all its steel from the Dalian Steel Plant (hereinafter referred to as Factory B). However, Factory B has not met Factory A's requirements in either quality or quantity. In terms of quantity, Factory B under-delivered approximately 200 tons of steel in each scheduled delivery period last year, with a total of more than 100 tons still owed by the end of the year. At one point, due to the lack of steel supply, as many as 52 machine tools were idle, disrupting the entire production plan.

In terms of quality, the steel also failed to meet Factory A's requirements. For example, for high-speed steel used to make foot knives and drill bits, Factory A requires it to be produced according to first-class standards; otherwise, fine cracks are likely to occur during forging, and the cutting edges are prone to "chipping" when used in cutting tools. However, Factory B repeatedly emphasized that Factory A's technical requirements were too strict and that it could only produce second-class products. For chromium-manganese steel used to make gauges and measuring tools, Factory A requires second-class products; otherwise, they are prone to grinding cracks and becoming scrap. But Factory B also emphasized that the technical conditions were insufficient and could only produce third-class products.

Because the steel supplied by Factory B did not meet quality standards, it was only after dozens of processes such as forging and cutting that it was discovered that the steel was substandard and scrapped. Factory A now has dozens of tons of such waste products.

Is it really due to insufficient technical conditions? No. According to Factory A's research, the main reason why high-speed steel fails to meet quality requirements is that Factory B did not properly conduct smelting inspections when casting steel ingots and could not accurately control the casting temperature. The reason why the quality of chromium-manganese steel is poor is mainly due to improper heat treatment. In July of last year, Factory A discovered that the annealing quality of 70 tons of chromium-manganese steel did not meet the specified standards and requested Factory B to send two people to re-anneal it, which resulted in meeting the quality standards. This shows that as long as Factory B accurately grasps the operating procedures and strictly inspects product quality, it can guarantee meeting the quality standards required by Factory A.

In the first half of last year, the high-speed steel supplied by the Daye Steel Plant to Factory A also failed to meet quality standards. However, after their efforts to improve, the goods delivered to Factory A in the first quarter of this year even exceeded the original quality standards. The equipment conditions of Daye Steel Plant and Dalian Steel Plant are exactly the same, so why can't Dalian Steel Plant quickly improve product quality?

Why does Factory B clearly know that the quality of steel cannot be reduced, but it does not supply steel according to quality requirements? The main reason is that the leaders of Factory B have the idea of "You can't buy steel without me," and therefore often deliberately make things difficult for Factory A at ordering meetings. As a result, each ordering meeting takes one or two months to conclude, and an agreement on product specifications and quality cannot be reached for a long time. Even if Factory B signs the order form, it delays delivery, and the delivered goods have so many defects (the defective rate of one batch of steel even reached 70%).

Dalian Steel Plant should quickly change this unhealthy management style, otherwise it will not only affect the production of fraternal factories but also directly endanger national construction.

    “离了我不行”的经营思想要不得
    本报记者　方青
    哈尔滨量具刃具厂（以下简称甲厂）所需要的钢材都是由大连炼钢厂（以下简称乙厂）供应。可是乙厂不论质量数量都没有满足甲厂的要求。从数量来看，去年乙厂在每一个规定的交货期都欠交二百吨左右的钢材，直到年底还欠一百多吨。有一个时期，由于钢材供应不上，竟有五十二台机床停工待料，打乱了整个生产规划。
    从质量来看，也是不能满足甲厂的要求。如用来做足刀、钻头的高速钢，甲厂要求必须按照一级品的规格生产，否则锻造的时候，就容易发生细小的裂纹；做成刃具用来切削就容易“崩刃”。可是乙厂却再三强调甲厂的技术条件要求太严，只能给生产二级品。用来做量规、量具的铬锰钢，甲厂要求必须是二级品，不然就容易发生磨裂而报废。而乙厂也强调技术条件不够，只给生产三级品。
    因为乙厂供应的钢材不合质量标准，经过锻冶、切削等几十道工序后，才发现因钢材不合规格而报废。现在甲厂已经有好几十吨这样的废品。
    真的是技术条件不够吗？不是。根据甲厂的研究，高速钢所以达不到质量要求，主要是因为乙厂在浇铸钢锭的时候，没有做好熔炼检查，不能准确掌握浇铸温度。铬锰钢的质量所以不好，主要是热处理没处理好。去年七月间，甲厂发现有七十吨铬锰钢的退火质量不合规定标准，要求乙厂派了两个人来重新退火，结果就达到了质量标准。这说明，只要乙厂准确地掌握操作规程，严格检验产品质量，就可以保证达到甲厂要求的质量标准。
    去年上半年，大冶炼钢厂供应甲厂的高速钢，也是质量不合标准。但他们努力改进后，今年第一季度交给甲厂的货，竟超过了原来规定的质量标准。大冶炼钢厂和大连炼钢厂的设备条件完全一样，为什么大连炼钢厂就不能迅速提高产品质量呢？
    为什么乙厂明明知道钢材质量不能降低，却不按照质量要求供应钢材呢？主要是乙厂领导人有“离了我，你就买不到钢材”的思想，因此在定货会议上，就常常故意刁难甲厂。所以每一次定货会议都要开一两个月，在产品规格、质量方面迟迟不能取得协议。乙厂即使在定货书上签了字，也拖延交货，交出的货废品又是那么多（有一批钢材废品竟达到70％）。
    大连炼钢厂应该迅速改变这种不良的经营作风，否则不仅影响兄弟厂生产，而且将直接危害国家建设。
