Title: Why Good Experience Doesn't Produce Good Results

Many coal mines have seen gradual improvements in production after promoting the advanced experience of the "one-shift coal mining system." However, after the Yangquan Mining Bureau implemented the "one-shift coal mining system," the average daily output declined month by month. Taking the four working faces of No. 1 well in the Third Mine as an example: before the promotion of the one-shift system last December, the average daily output of each working face was 529 tons. After the promotion of the "one-shift coal mining system" in January, the average in January was 462 tons, in February it was 415 tons, and in the first and middle ten days of March it was 387 tons. The situation in other mines is roughly the same.

The implementation of the "one-shift coal mining system" is a major reform in coal mine production. It is essential to make detailed plans and arrangements for transportation, empty cars, materials, tools, worker allocation, etc., in advance. However, the Yangquan Mining Bureau was completely unprepared for these issues. For example, the labor organization would undergo significant changes after the "one-shift coal mining system" was implemented. Originally, each coal mining team had more than seventy people, but now it could be reduced to about sixty. Initially, the leaders of the mines did not consider this work. When transferring personnel, they did not consult with workers and grassroots staff, and too many were transferred, resulting in a significant weakening of the technical strength of the coal mining teams. When Deputy Director Yang Ming learned about this, he didn't investigate the cause and decided to return the transferred people to their original teams, with some teams even having more people than before. With too many people, production became even more difficult to coordinate.

Due to insufficient preparation, the overhaul work of the preparation shift was not done well, and mechanical and electrical accidents occurred frequently. Once, the coal cutting machine on the 711 recovery working face of the Third Mine was used before it was properly repaired, and it stopped moving after only cutting thirty-odd meters. As soon as equipment malfunctions, the regular cycle is disrupted. To achieve a regular cycle, the leaders of the Third Mine mistakenly decided to shorten the cutting depth of the coal cutting machine from 1.8 meters to 1.6 meters, resulting in a situation where the working face had a regular cycle, but the task could not be completed. In addition, the dispatching work of this mine was also poorly done.

Although the production situation of the Yangquan Mining Bureau has improved somewhat recently, the lessons learned in the promotion of the "one-shift coal mining system" in this mine are worth remembering. That is: the leaders of an enterprise cannot improve production simply by having the determination to promote advanced experiences. They must also do a lot of specific, detailed organizational and ideological work accordingly. Otherwise, even if advanced experience is good, it cannot be implemented successfully.

    为什么好经验没好结果
    顾页
    许多煤矿推广“一班采煤制”的先进经验以后，生产都逐渐好转。阳泉矿务局推行“一班采煤制”以后，平均日产量却逐月下降。以三矿一号井的四个工作面为例：去年十二月没有推广一班采煤制以前，每个工作面的平均日产量为529吨，一月份推广“一班采煤制”以后，一月份平均为462吨，二月份为415吨，三月份上、中旬为387吨。其他各矿的情况也大致这样。
    实行“一班采煤制”，是煤矿生产上的一大改革。务必事先对运输、空车、材料、工具、工人配备等，作细致的计划和安排。可是阳泉矿务局对这些问题毫无准备。如推行“一班采煤制”以后，劳动组织会有很大的变动，原来每个采煤队七十多人，现在可以减少到六十人左右。起初，各矿的领导人就没有考虑这一工作，抽调的时候，又不跟工人和基层工作人员商量，抽得太多，致使采煤队技术力量大大削弱。副局长杨明知道了，又不弄清原因，就决定把抽调出来的人原班补回，有的队甚至比过去人数还多。人太多，生产反而更难调度。
    由于准备不充分，准备班的检修工作做得很不好，经常发生机电事故。有一次，三矿七一一回采工作面的截煤机没修好就拿去使用，结果只割根三十多公尺就不动了。设备一出事故，正规循环就被打乱。三矿领导人为了达到正规循环，便错误地决定将截煤机割根由一点八公尺缩短到一点六公尺，就出现了工作面虽然循环正规了，任务却完不成的现象。此外，这个矿的调度工作也做得不好。
    目前，阳泉矿务局的生产情况虽然有所好转，但是，这个矿推广“一班采煤制”当中的教训，是值得记取的。这就是：一个企业的领导人，仅仅有决心推广先进经验，是不能搞好生产的，还必须相应地做许多具体的细致的组织工作和思想工作。否则，先进经验虽然好，却推行不成。
