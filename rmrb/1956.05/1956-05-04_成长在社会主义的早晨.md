Growing Up in the Socialist Morning
　　Yuè Yě

　　"Mistakes are made by people, and people can eliminate them!"

　　When I asked Ding Jiazhen why she hadn't made any mistakes in her work as a telegraph operator for several years, she sat there, head down, hands folding a plain blue handkerchief on her knees, a little restrained but answering as accurately and clearly as she would send a telegram.

　　Ding Jiazhen is a telegraph operator at the Qiqihar Railway Administration Telegraph Office. She is only twenty-one years old this year, and at first glance, she looks like a middle school student. She is not short in stature, but she is not very robust. Her hair is thinly spread on her head, and two short braids are combed behind her ears, giving the impression that she has just recovered from an illness. However, her large eyes shine brightly.

　　Perhaps some would say that Ding Jiazhen's body is not very strong, and it must be because she is tired from work? On the contrary, in fact, it was only after she started working that her body became better and better.

　　Everyone has a childhood that they will never forget. Ding Jiazhen's childhood memories are ten times more bitter than Coptis chinensis. Ding Jiazhen's ancestral home is in Luan Nan County, Hebei Province. Not long after her father and mother married, they "went beyond the pass" because of poverty. When Ding Jiazhen was five years old, her father became ill and died because he could not afford medical treatment, leaving behind three children, all relying on their young mother to raise them. Then Ding Jiazhen's younger brother died of illness, and the eldest brother lived to be eight years old, but finally could not escape the clutches of disease and death. The successive departure of her husband and children was an irresistible blow to a mother. At this time, the young Ding Jiazhen became the hope and strength for her mother to continue living. Some people advised her mother to remarry while she was young, but she could not bear to leave her frail orphan, and would rather depend on her daughter for life, spending difficult years!

　　Seeing that Jiazhen had survived, no matter how hard she worked, her mother was determined to send her to school. Ding Jiazhen really liked going to school, but seeing her mother working hard all day long, she couldn't bear to leave home. In order to stay at home and help her mother with work, she said to her mother:

　　"Mom, I don't like going to school!"

　　"You girl, you are so unpromising, are you willing to be blind and be bullied when you grow up?" Her mother was angry.

　　From then on, Ding Jiazhen only started her school life in order to "not be blind when she grew up." At this time, she was just ten years old. The school was sixteen li away from home. She usually did not bring lunch, but endured the whole day, and went home to eat her second meal at night. At night, after helping her mother with work, she still did her homework under the soybean oil lamp, often until midnight.

　　The bitter days of the poor have come to an end. The Northeast was liberated, and the mother and daughter were allocated land for three people. Life took a big turn and began to move towards the bright road. In 1949, Ding Jiazhen joined the Communist Youth League, and at the end of that year, she was admitted to the Telegraph Team of Qiqihar Technical School.

　　At that time, the Telegraph Team of the Technical School only recruited two hundred people, but eight or nine hundred people applied, including many students from senior and junior high schools.

　　"How old are you?" the interviewer asked.

　　"Sixteen!" Ding Jiazhen relied on her height and falsely reported her age by one year.

　　"After studying, the work will be assigned to very far away places!" The interviewer looked at this tall but somewhat thin girl and said.

　　"As for work, wherever it is, I will go!" Ding Jiazhen replied firmly.

　　When studying in the Telegraph Team, she learned the new characters used for telegraphing. Because of her low level of education, Ding Jiazhen found it very difficult. Often, when others were asleep, she was still in bed, flipping through the "small cards" and muttering. Sometimes she was so sleepy that she seemed to fall into a big pit and fell asleep, but she immediately woke up suddenly. How could she not study well? So she rubbed her forehead, forced her eyes open, and continued to study.

　　Due to overworking in her studies, coupled with the fact that the disease had already been lurking in her body, Ding Jiazhen finally fell ill! At first, she still persisted, but her cough became heavier and heavier. When learning to copy telegrams, not only could she not learn because of her cough, but it also affected her classmates' copying, so she had to go outside the classroom. It seemed that learning could no longer continue. Her mother came to see her daughter. She dared not say anything to her daughter in person, but her heart was as painful as a knife, because in her memory, her husband and two sons had all left her because of this disease...

　　The matter was known to the school, and she was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. After examination, it was said that she had tuberculosis, but because the treatment and recuperation conditions were very good, Ding Jiazhen recovered quickly.

　　"This girl has good luck, she got sick when the Communist Party came. Otherwise, she would have been gone like her father and brother!" Her mother often said this to her neighbors, her eyes always shining with tears.

　　Ding Jiazhen graduated from the Telegraph Team. Because of her illness, her grades were of course not very good. When she heard that she was assigned to work in the Telegraph Office, she was really flustered. Was she just going to work like this? As soon as she entered the Telegraph Office, the machines "dripped and clattered," and her head was dizzy.

　　At this time, there was nothing wrong with her body, but her low skills were really distressing. Because of her low skills and the fact that she was a woman, within a few days of starting work, sarcasm came:

　　"Forget it, go do something else!"

　　"Don't waste your time, you'll get married in a few days, and as soon as you get married, you'll have children. What work can you do when you have children? Just the diapers are enough to wash!"

　　These words stung like needles, but Ding Jiazhen did not dare to cry in front of them. What were you crying about with such low skills? But she couldn't help it, so she rushed to get off work and went home to cry.

　　Life had told her more than once that crying was useless. As a member of the Communist Youth League, she thought of the organization. The organization helped her sign a master-apprentice contract with an old telegraph operator, and the teacher was an older telegraph operator and a woman. This teacher, Cheng Yuqin, helped her wholeheartedly, constantly teaching her to improve her skills and improve her work.

　　However, skills could not be improved in a day or two. The person Ding Jiazhen was sending telegrams to was a man, with good skills and a bad temper. Ding Jiazhen could not satisfy him, so she suffered a lot of his anger. Sometimes, when she couldn't bear it, she would get angry. However, Ding Jiazhen always tried to control herself immediately, thinking: this is not right, disunity not only affects work, but also wastes the "return line." The work is not being done for him, why should I do this? Although Ding Jiazhen forgave others, she did not easily forgive herself. Others could send telegrams immediately, but she couldn't, was this right?

　　"What's wrong? You always look unhappy when you come home. Did you make a mistake?" Her mother sent her daughter out every day and welcomed her daughter in, and seeing that her daughter's expression was not right when she came home today, she asked worriedly.

　　Ding Jiazhen did not say a word because of her incompetence. She even began to think in her heart: maybe she really couldn't do the job of a telegraph operator!

　　At this time, Ding Jiazhen had not fully realized the importance of telegraph work, so her will to overcome difficulties was not so strong, and her confidence was not so firm. Later, she received a great education in several accident investigation studies, and she understood what kind of work she was doing.

　　In the Qiqihar Railway Administration Telegraph Office, such a thing happened: the Administration sent a telegram to the Manzhouli Employee Supply Store, but the telegraph operator sent the wrong grain price in the instruction. The sent price was much lower than the market price, causing great losses to the state.

　　"Sending a telegram with a wrong dot or a wrong word will cause great losses." The leadership concluded: "If the content of the telegram is a change in train schedules, and the telegram is sent wrong, it will cause trains to collide, causing serious casualties and bringing great losses to the people. If the telegram is sent late, it will also cause great chaos. Other errors, such as incorrect train marshalling, copying the wrong train number, and inaccurate train confirmations, will all cause confusion in the railway transportation that runs as precisely as a clock."

　　"The Party has given me such important work, can't I overcome all difficulties and do it well? Did I waver just because I encountered a little difficulty?" Ding Jiazhen thought after returning home from get off work. Her face was a little flushed because of her inner excitement, but she was very excited. Tonight, she felt for the first time how important and glorious the work she was doing was.

　　Since Ding Jiazhen examined her erroneous thoughts, she worked with special enthusiasm and was always eager to do all her work well every day. But the more anxious she was, the more chaotic she became. Later, she only checked the telegrams once, and some were sent out before they could be checked. Because she was not sure, she was still worried about making mistakes after the work was done. In this way, she herself was almost suffocated by her strong sense of responsibility.

　　In 1952, the Qiqihar Railway Administration Telegraph Office promoted Sun Fuzeng's working method from the Beijing Telegraph Office. Because Sun Fuzeng implemented the method of "asking if you can't hear clearly, not sending if you can't see clearly, and checking if you can't remember clearly," he made no mistakes in sending 700,000 words. Ding Jiazhen regarded this experience as a treasure, as if a person had been groping in the dark for a long time and suddenly saw a bright road. Originally, she felt that she couldn't use all her enthusiasm for her work, but now that she had this working method, she felt that she had a "place to use her skills." Because Ding Jiazhen wholeheartedly devoted herself to work and technical learning, humbly accepted advanced experience, and carefully studied and boldly created, she finally achieved good results. On the basis of Sun Fuzeng's working method, she developed the working method of "accurate sending, stable copying, and careful checking." The errors in the Telegraph Office were greatly reduced, and Ding Jiazhen herself had not made any mistakes for several months in a row.

　　October 3, 1953, was a day that Ding Jiazhen will never forget. Because of her significantly improved awareness and humble learning of advanced experience, and her active work, she gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. When the Qiqihar Railway Administration held a general meeting of advanced producers, she was also selected to participate. At this meeting, she heard the report and saw the great picture of the country's construction, and she was extremely excited. She never thought that the development of our great motherland would be so rapid. Life was like a wonderful picture album, unfolding page by page in front of her. She felt that she was extremely fortunate to be able to personally participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. But another thing made Ding Jiazhen feel completely unexpected and made her extremely uneasy, that is, the conference decided to promote her advanced experience.

　　Tranquility is always temporary in life, and the road is always winding. Ding Jiazhen lost her peace again at this time. After returning to the Telegraph Office, she was very cautious, no, she was simply extremely nervous, always worried about making mistakes all day long.

　　"My working method is going to be promoted. If I make a mistake, what will that be like?" Ding Jiazhen thought, "Don't do anything embarrassing."

　　In this way, Ding Jiazhen thwarted her courage to move forward, became conservative, and her work efficiency was very low. Therefore, everyone gave her the nickname "Old Cow Telegraph Operator."

　　"What advanced worker? With this kind of work, no one can make a mistake!" Someone said unconvinced.

　　Ding Jiazhen felt very sad. Yes! Did she want everyone to learn from her and work as slowly as an old cow? Thinking of this, she started to get emotional with herself again. After the leadership's help and education, she calmed down and found the root cause of her fear of working boldly under the leadership's help: her skills were still not skilled, thorough, or refined. In other words, although she already had some capital, it was still not enough. Immediately afterwards, they helped her make a plan to strengthen political study and technical study, and life returned to the right track. Ding Jiazhen was very serious about studying at this time. She even used the time she spent walking, reciting "abbreviations" or "retransmission routes" while walking.

　　At this time, a person began to enter her heart. She met Wei Enge, a technical education engineer in the Telecommunications Section, more and more often. Wei Enge could help Ding Jiazhen make progress, and slowly they fell in love.

　　Ding Jiazhen is good at absorbing the advantages of others' work. Song Xuewen and Liu Can in the office have good skills, and their telegrams are particularly clear and easy to copy. She carefully observed and studied, and compared them with herself. Gradually, she figured out that the reason why she didn't type clearly was because her hand movements were wrong, so she seriously learned from them. Wang Entai checked telegrams quickly and without errors, which also attracted her attention. After careful research, she found that Wang Entai used a pencil to compare the letters of the new characters that made up a word, and then looked at the next word after reading one word. In this way, he could see it in one go. She checked each letter one by one, resulting in checking three times, spending a lot of time, but still not being able to ensure no errors. She immediately learned Wang Entai's method. So Ding Jiazhen quickly made progress. After a long period of accumulation, Ding Jiazhen had completed one million safe words and prevented some accidents. Therefore, she attended the National Youth Socialist Construction Activist Conference in 1955.

　　At this meeting, she received great education and encouragement, and she cried several times. But the tears were no longer as sour and bitter as in the past, these were tears of gratitude and tears of happiness! After the meeting, she returned to the bureau and put forward a higher goal: to reach the standard of an all-round telegraph operator within a certain period. This year, before coming to Beijing to attend the National Railway Advanced Producer Representative Conference, except for the regulations and code translation, which had not yet been tested, she had reached the standards for sending, copying, typing and writing, acceptance, and telephone communication.

　　Ding Jiazhen usually completes an average of more than 400 words in her eight-hour workday, which is a meticulous but ordinary job. In this line of work, not everyone is content to work. Some people think that "this line is both rigid and has no development," but Ding Jiazhen does not think so. Last New Year's Day, when she married Wei Enge, she said to the comrades and friends who came to congratulate them: "I want to do telegraph work for the rest of my life, because this is what the motherland and the people need, so the post of telegraph operator is also the most glorious!"

　　This aspiration was first supported by her mother. In her mother's opinion, her daughter should completely dedicate everything she has to the Communist Party, because it was the Party that saved her life and nurtured and raised her to adulthood.

　　When I learned that Ding Jiazhen was going to come to Beijing again in late April to attend the National Advanced Producer Representative Conference, I sincerely congratulated her, but she still said with some childishness and uneasiness: "It's better not to come to Beijing. Once I come to Beijing, I feel more and more insignificant. What achievements have I made? Too few! What contributions have I made? None!"

　　Our motherland is in the socialist morning, and twenty-one-year-old Ding Jiazhen is also in the morning of her own life. There is so much work for people to do now and in the future. There is no doubt that people who can overcome mistakes and eliminate mistakes will make more and greater contributions!

　　成长在社会主义的早晨
　　岳野
    “错误是人造成的，人就可以消灭它！”
    当我问丁家珍为什么她在担任电报员的工作中，几年就没出过什么差错的时候，她坐在那里，低着头、双手在自己的膝盖上叠弄着一块普通的蓝色手绢、稍稍有些拘谨地然而又像她在拍发电报那样准确而清楚地回答。
    丁家珍是齐齐哈尔铁路管理局电报所里的电报员，今年她才二十一岁，一眼看去，还像个中学生。论身材，长得倒不矮小，不过却不十分健壮。头发薄薄地铺在头上，两条短辫子梳在耳后，乍看好像刚刚生过病还未完全复原似的。然而一双大眼却闪耀着光亮。
    也许有人说，丁家珍的身体不是十分结实，一定是在工作中累的吧？恰恰相反，事实上是当她参加了工作之后，身体才越来越变好起来的。
    每个人都有他永远难以忘怀的童年。在丁家珍的记忆中的童年生活是比黄莲还要苦上十分的。丁家珍的老家是在河北滦南县，她的父亲和母亲结婚后不久，便因为穷困“下了关外”，丁家珍五岁那年，父亲生了病，没钱医治死了。撇下三个孩子，全靠年青的妈妈抚养。接着丁家珍的小弟弟又病死了，大弟弟活到八岁，终于也未能逃脱疾病和死亡的魔爪。丈夫、孩子接连着离去，对一个做母亲的来说，是难以抗拒的打击。这时，年幼的丁家珍便成了支持母亲继续活下去的希望和力量。有人曾劝她妈妈趁年青改嫁，但是她舍不得身体瘦弱的孤女，宁肯母女相依为命，度着苦难的岁月！
    妈妈眼看家珍这棵苗好歹留住了，不管自己多么辛苦，便决心送她去念书。丁家珍心里是非常喜欢上学的，可是她眼见妈妈终日操劳，便不忍心离家，为了能留在家里帮助妈妈干活，她便对妈妈说：
    “妈妈，我不喜欢上学！”
    “你这个丫头，就这么不争气，大了甘愿做个睁眼瞎子，受人欺负？”妈妈生气了。
    丁家珍自此便也只是为了“大了不做睁眼瞎子”开始了学校生活，这时她刚刚十岁。学校离家十六里路，她平时总不带午饭，硬撑一天，晚上回家再吃第二顿。夜晚她帮助妈妈干完了活，仍在豆油灯下做功课，常常做到半夜。
    苦人儿的苦日子到了头，东北解放了，母女二人分得了三人的土地，生活来了个大转弯，开始向光明的大道上走。1949年，丁家珍加入了青年团，就在这年年底，考入了齐齐哈尔技术学校电报队。
    技术学校电报队当时仅招收二百人，投考的却去了八、九百，其中高、初中的学生还很多。
    “多大啦？”口试人问。
    “十六！”丁家珍仗着个子大，虚报了一岁。
    “学习完，工作要分配到很远的地方去啊！”口试人望着这位身材高大，但有些瘦弱的姑娘又说。
    “工作嘛，要到哪，就到哪！”丁家珍坚定地回答。
    在电报队学习的时候，上来便学打电报用的新文字，因为文化水平低，丁家珍觉得很吃力，常常别人都睡了，自己还在被子里翻着“小卡片”叨咕。有时困极了，好像一下跌进一个大坑里去一样睡了过去，但立即又猛然惊醒过来。学习不好怎么行呢？于是自己给自己揉揉额头，用力睁睁眼睛，继续再学。
    由于学习中过分地用功，又加上疾病早已潜伏在身上，丁家珍终于病倒了！最初她仍坚持着，但是咳嗽越来越重，在学习抄报的时候，不但自己因为咳嗽无法学，而且也影响同学们抄报，这时便不得不走到教室外面去。看来学习再难继续了。妈妈来看望女儿，当面不敢对女儿说什么，可是心里却痛如刀搅，因为在她的记忆里，丈夫和两个儿子都是得这种病离开她的……。
    事情被校方知道了，立即把她送到医院里去治疗，经过检查，说是肺结核，但是由于治疗、休养条件很好，丁家珍很快便好了。
    “这个丫头时运好，赶着共产党来了她才生病，要不，早就像她老子、弟弟一样没啦！”妈妈经常这样对邻人说，她的两只眼里总闪着泪光。
    丁家珍由电报队毕业了。因为病，学习成绩当然不很好。当她听说把她分配到电报所工作的时候，她着实有些心慌了，难道就这样去工作吗？一进电报所，机器“滴里拍拉”，脑袋都昏了。
    这时身体倒已没有什么，可是技术低真叫人苦恼。技术低，又加上是个女的，开始工作没几天，风凉话便来了：
    “算啦，干点别的去吧！”
    “别白搭工夫啦，不几天就结婚啦，一结婚就生孩子，孩子一生还干什么工作？光尿布就够洗的啦！”
    这些话像针一样刺人，可是丁家珍却不敢当面哭，你技术低还哭什么呢？可是又忍不住，便蹩到下班，回家哭去。
    生活不只一次地告诉她，光是哭是没有任何用处的。做为一个青年团员，她想到了组织，组织上帮助她同老电报员订立了师徒合同，而且老师是一个较老的电报员，并且是个女的。这位程玉琴老师便专心帮助她，不断地教她提高技术和改进工作。
    但是，技术却不是一天半天就能变得很好的。丁家珍拍电报的对方是个男的，技术好，脾气大，丁家珍当然不能满足他，因此便受了他不少气，有时自己实在忍不住了便也发起气来。不过丁家珍总能想法立即控制自己，心想：这是不应该的，闹得不团结不但影响工作，还要浪费“回线”，工作又不是为他做的，干什么要这样呢？丁家珍虽然原谅了别人，却不轻易原谅自己，别人上去就通报，自己就不行，难道这是应该的吗？
    “怎么啦？你回家来总是闷闷不乐的，出了什么差错了吧？”妈妈每天送女儿出门，接女儿进门，看见女儿今天回家来的神色不对，担心地问。
    丁家珍却为了自己的低能一语不发。甚至她心里开始想：也许自己真的做不了电报员的工作！
    这个时候，丁家珍的确还没有完全认识到电报工作的重要意义，因此战胜困难的意志还不是那么坚强，信心还不是那么牢固。后来，她在几次检查事故的学习中，受到了很大教育，她懂得了自己究竟在做着一种什么样的工作。
    在齐齐哈尔铁路管理局电报所里就发生过这样的事：管理局拍电报给满洲里职工供应商店，结果电报员把指示中的粮价拍错了，拍出去的价格比市价低很多，给国家造成了很大损失。
    “发电报错了一个点、一个字，都会造成大损失。”领导上总结说：“如果电报的内容是列车改点运行，把报拍错，就会使列车互撞，造成严重伤亡事故，给人民带来极大损失。如果报拍迟了，同样会出大乱子。其他如列车编组出错，抄错车号，列车确报不确实都会使精确得像钟表一样运行着的铁路运输产生混乱。”
    “这样重要的工作，党交给我做，难道我就不会克服一切困难，把它做好吗？难道刚碰上一点困难，我就动摇了吗？”丁家珍下班后回到家里想道。因为内心的激动脸有些发热，但是她很兴奋，今晚她第一次感到她担任的工作是多么的重要和光荣。
    丁家珍自从检查了自己的错误思想，工作得特别积极热情，每天总急着要做好一切工作。可是越急越乱，乱到后来电报只检查一遍，有的等不得检查便送了出去，因为心里没底，工作做完了仍然担心会出漏子，这样她自己就把责任心很强的自己压得几乎喘不过气来。
    1952年，齐齐哈尔铁路管理局电报所推广北京电报所孙福增的工作方法。孙福增由于实行“听不清就问、看不清不发、记不清就检”的方法，做到了七十万词出手无错，丁家珍把这经验看成了宝贝，就好像一个人长期在黑夜里摸索，突然看到了一条光明大道一样欢喜。原来是满腹的热情总觉得使不到工作上去，现在有了这工作方法她认为有了“用武之地”了。丁家珍由于全心全意投入了工作和学习技术，虚心地接受先进经验，并且细心钻研、大胆创造、终于获得了很好的结果。她在孙福增工作法的基础上，发展出来“发报准、抄报稳、细心检查”的工作方法。电报所的错误大大减少了，丁家珍自己一连几个月都未发生过任何错误。
    1953年10月3日是丁家珍终生难忘的日子。由于她的觉悟显著地提高和虚心学习先进经验，工作积极，她光荣地参加了中国共产党。齐齐哈尔铁路管理局召开全局先进生产者代表大会时，她也被选参加。在这个大会上，她听到了报告，看到了祖国建设的伟大图景，激动极了，真没想到我们伟大祖国的发展居然这样神速。生活像一本美妙的画册，一页页地在她面前揭开来，她感到能够亲身参加祖国社会主义的建设，真幸福极了。可是另一件事却使丁家珍感到完全意外，并且使她极端不安，那就是大会决定要推广她的先进经验。
    平静在生活中总是暂时的，道路总是弯弯曲曲的。丁家珍这时又失去了平静，回到电报所以后，她很谨慎，不，简直是紧张极了，一天到晚总担心出错。
    “要推广自己的工作方法了，自己要是出了错，那可像什么话？”丁家珍心里想，“千万不要干出丢人的事来。”
    就这样，丁家珍自己把自己前进的勇气挫伤了，变得保守了，工作效率非常低，因此大家便给她起了个绰号叫：“老牛电报员”。
    “什么先进工作者？这样干法，谁也出不了错！”有人不服气地说。
    丁家珍心里很难过。是啊！难道让大家学习自己像老牛那样慢吞吞地工作吗？想到这里，她又自己跟自己闹开了情绪，经过领导上的帮助、教育，冷静下来了，在领导帮助下找出了不敢大胆工作的根本原因：技术还是不熟、不透、不精。换句话说，本钱虽已经有了点，但还是不足。紧接着便又帮助她订了加强政治学习和技术学习的计划，生活才又走上了正轨。丁家珍这时对学习抓得很紧，平时她连走路的时间也利用了，一边走一边背诵“略号”或者“转报经路”。
    就在这时，一个人开始走进了她的心灵，她同电务段里的技术教育工程师魏恩格见面越来越多了。魏恩格很能帮助丁家珍进步，慢慢他们就相爱了起来。
    丁家珍善于吸收别人工作中的优点，所里宋学文、刘灿技术好，拍报打点特别清楚，抄也好抄。她仔细地观察研究，并且和自己对比，渐渐她弄清楚了，原来自己打得不清楚是因为手的动作不对，于是便认真向他们学习。王恩泰检报又快又不出错，这也引起了她的注意，仔细一研究，发现王恩泰是把组成一个字的几个新文字字母用铅笔比量着看，看完一个字再看第二个，这样看一道便可以了。自己却一个字母一个字母地检查，结果检查三遍，多花很多时间，仍不能确保无错。她便马上又把王恩泰的方法学过来。于是丁家珍便迅速地进步起来，经过了长时期的积累，丁家珍已完成了一百万安全词，并且防止了一些事故。因此她出席了1955年的全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会。
    在这个大会上，她受到了极大的教育和鼓舞，她曾经几次流泪。不过眼泪再也不像过去那样酸苦了，这是感激的泪水，幸福的泪水！会后，她回到局里，便提出了更高的奋斗目标：要在一定时期内达成全能电报员的标准。今年，在来北京参加全国铁路先进生产者代表大会之前，除了规程、译电两项未来得及测验外，而发、抄、打字誊写、受理、电报通话等都已达到了标准。
    丁家珍平时每日在八小时的工作里，平均要完成四百多词，这是一项细致然而又平凡的工作。而在这一行中，并不是每个人都安心工作的，有人认为“搞这行既呆板又没发展”，丁家珍却不这样想。去年元旦，当她同魏恩格结婚的时候，她就对前来祝贺他们的同志、朋友说过：“我要干一辈子的电报工作，因为这是祖国和人民所需要的，因此电报员的岗位也是最光荣的！”
    这志愿首先得到了妈妈的支持，在妈妈看来，女儿是完完全全应该把自己的一切贡献给共产党的，因为是党救活了她，抚育和教养了她长大成人的。
    当我知道了丁家珍四月下旬还要来北京参加全国先进生产者代表大会时，我便衷心向她祝贺，她却仍然有些稚气并带着一些不安的神色说：“不来北京还好点，一到北京便越觉得自己渺小了，我做出来什么成绩呢？太少了！有什么贡献呢？没有啊！”
    我们的祖国正处在社会主义的早晨，二十一岁的丁家珍也正处于她自己生命的早晨，现在、将来都有那末多工作要人去做，能战胜错误并且消灭错误的人，毫无疑问，一定会做出更多更大的贡献的！
