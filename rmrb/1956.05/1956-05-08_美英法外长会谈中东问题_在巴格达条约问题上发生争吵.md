Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch from Paris: The foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France held a meeting in Paris on the 6th to discuss Middle East issues and other international matters. According to Agence France-Presse, French Foreign Minister Pineau announced after the meeting that the three foreign ministers unanimously agreed that the Middle East issue should no longer be dealt with according to the provisions of the 1950 Tripartite Declaration, as this declaration no longer conforms to the current situation. They unanimously agreed that the Middle East issue should be handled within the scope of the United Nations Security Council. Pineau also said that the discussion on the Middle East issue was limited to an "exchange of views," "but no solution was found to the Israeli-Arab conflict."

According to Western news agency reports, during the discussion, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France argued over the Baghdad Pact. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd and US Secretary of State Dulles both expressed their intention to strengthen the Baghdad Pact, and Lloyd even said that this treaty was "a foundation of British policy." However, Pineau insisted that this alliance was the root cause of the misfortunes currently suffered by the West in the Middle East.

An Egyptian "Al-Ahram" reporter, when talking about the failure to reach an agreement at the meeting, emphasized that the meeting of the three foreign ministers confirmed that without the consent and cooperation of the Soviet Union, the three Western countries cannot solve the Middle East problem.

    美英法外长会谈中东问题
    在巴格达条约问题上发生争吵
    新华社7日讯  巴黎消息：美英法三国外交部长六日在巴黎举行会谈，讨论了中东问题和其他一些国际问题。据法新社报道，法国外交部长比诺在会后宣布，三国外交部长一致认为，中东问题不再应当按照1950年三国宣言的规定予以对待，这个宣言已经不再符合目前的局势。他们一致认为，中东问题应当在联合国安全理事会的范围以内来处理。比诺还说，关于中东问题的讨论只限于“交换意见”，“但是并没有找到解决以色列—阿拉伯冲突的任何办法”。
    据西方通讯社消息，在讨论中，美英法三国代表在巴格达条约问题上发生了争吵。英国外交大臣劳埃德和美国国务卿杜勒斯都表示要加强巴格达条约，劳埃德并且说，这个条约是“英国政策的一个基础”。但是比诺则坚持这个联盟是西方目前在中东遭到的不幸的根源。
    埃及“金字塔报”记者在谈到会谈没有达成协议时强调指出：三国外交部长的这次会谈证实了在没有苏联的同意和合作下，西方三国不能解决中东问题。
