Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 9th: According to a Colombo dispatch from the Indian Press Trust: Ceylon Prime Minister Bandaranaike said at a press conference today that he would invite the People's Republic of China to send representatives to participate in the Nirvana Anniversary of Sakyamuni to be held in Ceylon starting on May 24th. He said that he hoped to invite all countries with a large number of Buddhists to participate.

Bandaranaike also said that the continued existence of British bases in Ceylon is in fundamental conflict with his entire concept of world affairs and the attitude Ceylon has adopted on foreign policy issues.

He made these remarks in response to a suggestion made by the US "New York Times" on May 6th. The "New York Times" suggested that the Commonwealth Prime Ministers should exert pressure on Bandaranaike at their upcoming meeting "to change his attitude towards the British bases there."

Bandaranaike also said that Ceylon hopes to negotiate and conclude non-aggression treaties not only with Asian countries, but also with other countries.

    锡兰总理将邀我国代表参加释迦牟尼?槃纪念
    他在记者招待会上再次表示英国应撤出在锡兰的基地
    新华社新德里9日电  据印度报业托辣斯科伦坡消息：锡兰总理班达拉奈克今天在记者招待会上说，他将邀请中华人民共和国派遣代表参加从五月二十四日开始在锡兰举行的释迦牟尼?槃纪念活动。他说，他希望邀请所有的有着众多佛教徒的国家都来参加。
    班达拉奈克还说，英国在锡兰的基地继续存在，是同他的关于世界事务的全部概念以及锡兰在外交问题方面所采取的态度有基本冲突的。
    他是针对美国“纽约时报”五月六日所提出的一个建议说这番话的。“纽约时报”建议英联邦总理们在他们即将举行的会议上对班达拉奈克施加压力，“使他改变他对那里的英国基地的态度”。
    班达拉奈克还说，锡兰希望不仅同亚洲国家谈判缔结互不侵犯条约，同时也同其他国家谈判缔结这种条约。
