Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 1st. The Fourth Congress of the Communist Party of India, in its unanimously adopted political resolution, put forward the Communist Party's eight-point program for struggling for peace and defending national freedom. These eight points are:

　　(1) Oppose the danger of war, support the prohibition of atomic weapons and weapons of mass destruction, and support disarmament;

　　(2) Oppose military treaties, especially the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact;

　　(3) Support strengthening Asian solidarity, support the conclusion of a collective peace treaty for the Asian and Pacific region;

　　(4) Support the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, support strengthening friendly ties and cooperation between India and the Soviet Union and China in all aspects—economically, culturally, and in resolving international issues on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence;

　　(5) Fully support the anti-imperialist struggle of the colonial peoples;

　　(6) Support the adoption of effective measures to liberate Goa;

　　(7) Support improving relations with Pakistan, resolving outstanding issues through peaceful means, and signing a non-aggression treaty through friendly negotiations, support the reconstruction of the economic relations between India and Pakistan that were disrupted by the partition, abolish all barriers that hinder the establishment of mutually beneficial relations between the peoples of the two countries, and promote cultural and other activities to strengthen the fraternal relations between the two countries;

　　(8) Support severing relations with the British Commonwealth.

The political resolution, which the Communist Party of India released to the press on April 30, stated: In this worldwide struggle against the threat of war, against military treaties, for the establishment of peaceful relations, and for the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, the Republic of India has played an increasingly important role in recent years. This role has enhanced India's international prestige and aroused a sense of national pride in every patriotic Indian. This role has earned India the friendship and respect of peace-loving countries and forces, it has further isolated the imperialists, and strengthened the Asian countries' resistance to imperialist pressure. India's emergence as an independent and autonomous republic upholding the cause of peace and freedom is a factor of profound significance in the world today.

The resolution stated that the new relationship between India and the socialist world, led by the Soviet Union and China, is not only a factor in strengthening world peace, but also an important way to strengthen India's own position in world affairs and consolidate India's freedom and economy—as can be seen from the statements made by Soviet leaders on the Kashmir issue and the Goa issue, as well as from the economic agreements concluded between India and the Soviet Union and socialist countries.

The political resolution stated that the Communist Party has always struggled for the implementation of a firm policy of peace and for the establishment of friendly relations with all peace-loving countries. It welcomes and supports these achievements and will continue to work to inspire the people and unite the people to further develop these achievements.

The political resolution, in referring to US policy, stated that the US-Pakistan military treaty is a blatant attempt to change the balance of power in the region, attempting to put Pakistan in a position against India and create tension between the two countries. It is an attempt to make Asians fight Asians.

The political resolution calls for: vigorous efforts to initiate and build a united national movement including all forces, parties, and organizations, including the Congress Party, to support and consolidate the government's peaceful policy of defending India's freedom and sovereignty.

The political resolution stated that the task of establishing national unity for the purpose of striving for peace, defense, strengthening freedom, carrying out national construction, protecting the vital interests of the people, and expanding democracy is an extremely complex task. This task requires supporting the government's position of striving for peace and further striving to strengthen peace efforts. This task requires supporting all the government's measures that are sufficient to weaken the position of imperialism and feudalism, as well as curbing monopoly capital and strengthening the national economy.

The political resolution also stated that this task requires forcing the government to accelerate the progress of industrialization and adopt measures related to this task, requiring a fierce struggle against policies that compromise and concede to foreign capital, landlords, and monopoly groups, requiring a resolute struggle to improve the living conditions of the people, and requiring the protection and expansion of democratic rights.

The political resolution stated that the Communist Party of India must stand up as an independent national force. It will serve as the opposition party to the current government.

The political resolution stated that, premised on the interests of the country and the people, the Communist Party will give heartfelt support to the government's policy of defending peace and every measure taken by the government to reduce India's economic dependence on imperialism. However, it will oppose the government's making serious concessions to foreign capital and will mobilize the masses to abolish such concessions.

The political resolution concluded by saying that in this national task, it will obtain the cooperation of all parties and revolutionary forces in this country.

　　为争取和平和保卫民族自由而斗争
    印度共产党第四次代表大会通过八条纲领
    新华社新德里1日电　印度共产党第四次代表大会在它一致通过的政治决议中提出了共产党关于为争取和平和保卫民族自由而斗争的八条纲领。这八条纲领是：
    （一）反对战争危险，赞成禁止原子武器和大规模毁灭性武器，赞成裁军；
    （二）反对军事条约，特别是东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约；
    （三）赞成加强亚洲的团结，赞成缔结亚洲和太平洋地区的集体和平条约；
    （四）赞成恢复人民中国在联合国中的合法权，赞成加强印度同苏联和中国在一切方面——在经济方面、文化方面和在五项原则的基础上解决国际问题方面的友好联系和合作；
    （五）完全支持殖民地人民的反帝国主义斗争；
    （六）赞成采取有效措施解放果阿；
    （七）赞成改善同巴基斯坦的关系，用和平的方法来解决悬而未决的问题以及友好地谈判签订非战条约，赞成重建由于分治而脱节的印度和巴基斯坦之间的经济关系，取消一切妨碍在两国人民之间建立互利关系的壁垒，促进文化和其他方面的活动来加强两国之间的兄弟般的关系；
    （八）赞成同英联邦脱离关系。
    印度共产党在四月三十日向报界发表的这个政治决议说：在这个世界规模的反对战争威胁、反对军事条约、争取建立和平关系、争取禁止大规模毁灭性武器的斗争中，印度共和国近几年来已经起了愈来愈重要的作用，这种作用提高了印度的国际声望，并且唤起了每一个爱国的印度人的民族自豪感。这种作用使印度赢得了爱好和平的国家和力量的友谊和尊敬，它使帝国主义者更加孤立，加强了亚洲国家对帝国主义压力的抵抗，印度作为一个维护和平和自由事业的独立自主共和国的出现在今日的世界上是一个具有深刻意义的因素。
    决议说，印度和以苏联和中国为首的社会主义世界之间的新关系，不仅是加强世界和平的一个因素，同时也是加强印度自己在世界事务中的地位，巩固印度的自由和经济的重要方法——这从苏联领袖就克什米尔问题和果阿问题发表的声明以及从印度同苏联和社会主义国家所缔结的经济协定中可以看出来。
    政治决议说，共产党一向为实行坚定不移的和平政策，为同各个爱好和平的国家建立友好关系而斗争，它欢迎并且支持这些成就，并且将继续努力激发人民和团结人民进一步发扬这种成就。
    政治决议在谈到美国政策的时候说，美巴军事条约是一个公然企图改变这个地区的武装平衡状态的尝试，它企图把巴基斯坦放在反对印度的地位、并且制造两国之间的紧张状态。它是使亚洲人打亚洲人的一种尝试。
    政治决议要求：进行坚定的努力来创始和建立包括国大党在内的各个力量、党派和组织的统一的民族运动，来支持和巩固政府的保卫印度自由和主权的和平政策。
    政治决议说，建立目的在争取和平、防御、加强自由、进行国家建设、保护人民群众切身利益和扩大民主的全国团结的任务是一项极为复杂的任务。这项任务要求支持政府的争取和平的立场和进一步争取加强和平的努力，这项任务要求支持政府的一切足以削弱帝国主义和封建主义的地位以及遏制垄断资本和加强民族经济的措施。
    政治决议还说，这一任务要求迫使政府加速工业化的进度并且采取有关这项任务的措施，要求对向外国资本、地主和垄断集团妥协让步的政策进行激烈的斗争，要求坚决地争取改善人民生活条件，要求保障和扩大民主权利。
    政治决议说，印度共产党必须作为独立的民族力量挺身而出。它将充当现政府的反对党。
    政治决议说，共产党以国家和人民的利益为前提，对政府保卫和平的政策以及政府所采取的减少印度经济对帝国主义的依赖的每项措施将给予衷心的支持。但是，它将反对政府对外国资本作出严重的让步，并且将动员群众以便取消这种让步。
    政治决议最后说，在这个全国任务方面，它将取得这个国家中所有党派和革命力量的合作。
