    Rikaze's Horse Racing and Archery Competition

    On the 17th, the people of the Rikaze region held a grand horse racing and archery competition in the western suburbs of Rikaze City to welcome the Central Delegation.

    Panchen Erdeni accompanied Chen Yi, head of the Central Delegation, and deputy heads Zhang Jingwu, Wang Feng, and Huang Qixiang, to watch equestrian and horsemanship performances. The racecourse was surrounded by more than 10,000 spectators.

    Ninety-five young and middle-aged farmers and herdsmen from the middle and upper reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River and the northern Tibetan grasslands, dressed as ancient knights, rode their steeds, with feathers, embroidered balls, and colored silks attached to the horses' heads. They galloped into the arena amidst enthusiastic applause from the audience. First, they performed equestrian archery. The first knight, a young man named Suolang riding a brown horse, whipped his horse forward while bending down to take an arrow. He hit the bullseye with one arrow, then lay flat on the horse and galloped out of the arena. The audience cheered loudly. The team of knights performed in sequence. The knights also performed the feat of bending down to pick up hadas from the ground while riding. A knight named Zeren continuously bent down and picked up twelve hadas from the ground while running a distance of about twenty meters. This team of knights also performed shooting on horseback.

    Twenty-four Tibetan youths wearing white silk tops, holding whips high and tightening the reins, rode their horses across the arena as if they were flying. They were all outstanding riders from Rikaze, specially performing a horse racing competition for the Central Delegation.

    Finally, Tibetan soldiers of the Panchen Guard Battalion performed wonderful equestrian skills such as lying on their backs and standing upside down on horseback.

    After the performance, the Central Delegation presented hadas and gifts to the knights.

    Rikaze usually holds a horse racing and archery competition every autumn. This time, it was held in advance to welcome the Central Delegation, and it was the grandest in the last thirty years.

    日喀则的跑马射箭大会
    日喀则地区人民十七日在日喀则市西郊的广场上，举行了盛大的跑马射箭大会，欢迎中央代表团。
    班禅额尔德尼陪同中央代表团团长陈毅，副团长张经武、汪锋、黄琪翔等观看了骑射和马术表演。在跑马场的四周，坐满了一万多观众。
    九十五名来自雅鲁藏布江中、上游和藏北草原的青壮年农、牧民，扮成古代骑士，骑着骏马，马头上插着羽毛、挂着绣球和彩绸，在观众的热烈掌声中，策马驰入会场。他们首先表演了骑射，第一名骑着棕色骏马名叫索朗的青年骑士，一边鞭马急驰，一边弯身取箭，一箭射中靶心，然后一卧马上，奔出会场，观众大声喝彩。这队骑士依次作了表演。骑士们还表演了在跑马的时候，弯身拾起地面上的哈达，一位名叫泽仁的骑士，在跑过约二十公尺的距离中，连续弯身从地面上拾起了十二条哈达。这队骑士还在马上表演了枪击。
    二十四名穿着白绸上装的藏族青年，高举马鞭，紧勒缰绳，像腾空一样地骑马跑过会场。他们都是日喀则出色的骑手，特地为中央代表团表演了跑马比赛。
    最后，班禅警卫营的藏族战士表演了仰卧、倒立等精彩的骑术。
    表演结束后，中央代表团给骑士们赠送了哈达和礼品。
    日喀则在每年秋季照例举行一次跑马射箭大会，这次为了欢迎中央代表团提前举行的，也是最近三十多年来最盛大的一次。    　　（新华社）
