    Struggle to Support the Demand for the Release of Álvaro Cunhal and His Comrades
    Álvaro Cunhal, a member the Central Committee of the Portuguese Communist Party, was arrested on March 25, 1949, and sentenced to seven years in prison. During this period, the fascists subjected him to unbearable prison conditions and did not provide any medical care that his health required. They wanted to kill him.
    Álvaro Cunhal spent more than twenty-five years of his life engaged in the struggle to defend the interests of youth, the working class, and the people.
    In the court that tried him, he exposed Salazar's policy of subservience to foreign countries and the dedication of national wealth to American monopolists. He also exposed the terrorist acts of the Portuguese government. He defended the correctness of the party's political line and the peaceful policies of socialist countries. In that trial, he voiced the call of the working people, the call of the Communist Party, the best defender of Portuguese independence.
    On January 25th of this year, Álvaro Cunhal completed his sentence, but the fascists did not release him. The government still wants to detain him in prison and, if possible, send him to the Tarrafal concentration camp or the Pide concentration camp.
    The same danger exists for other comrades of the Portuguese Communist Party, such as: Francisco Miguel, Joaquim Campino, José Maria de Rosário, José Magro (who have already completed their sentences), Manuel Rodrigo da Silva, Manuel Guedes, Américo de Sousa, Jaime Serra, Jorgeta Ferreira, and Isola Silva.
    The progressive people of Portugal oppose these conspiracies. And their struggle is supported by the democratic forces of other countries. Progressive people demand the release of Álvaro Cunhal and all the patriots detained in prisons and sentenced to a slow death.

    声援要求释放阿尔瓦罗·库纳尔及其同伴的斗争
    葡萄牙共产党中央委员阿尔瓦罗·库纳尔于1949年3月25日被捕，判处徒刑七年。在这期间，法西斯主义者把他置于难以忍受的监禁条件下，并且没有给予他的健康情况所需要的任何医疗。他们想杀害他。
    阿尔瓦罗·库纳尔的一生中，有二十五年多的时间从事着保卫青年、工人阶级及人民利益的斗争。
    在审判他的法庭上，他揭露了萨拉查的屈从外国，把国家财富献给美国垄断资本家的政策，也揭露了葡萄牙政府的恐怖行为。他维护了党的政治路线的正确性以及社会主义国家的和平政策。在那次审判中，他发出了代表劳动人民的呼声，葡萄牙独立的最好保卫者共产党的呼声。
    今年一月二十五日阿尔瓦罗·库纳尔服满了刑期，但法西斯主义者并没有把他释放。政府还想把他拘禁在监狱中，如果可能的话，把他送到塔拉发尔集中营或庇耶集中营去。
    对葡萄牙共产党的其他一些同志也存在着同样的危险，如：佛兰西斯哥·米契尔、荷阿及姆·康必诺、何塞·玛丽亚、德·罗札瑞奥、何塞·马哥罗（他们已服满刑期）、曼努尔·罗德瑞哥·德·席尔瓦、曼努尔·格德斯、阿美瑞哥·德·苏萨、杰姆·塞拉、乔杰塔·费莱拉、伊索拉·席尔瓦。
    葡萄牙的进步人民反对这些阴谋。而他们的斗争是得到其他国家的民主力量的支持的。进步的人民要求释放阿尔瓦罗·库纳尔及所有被拘押在监狱中并被判处慢性死刑的爱国者。
