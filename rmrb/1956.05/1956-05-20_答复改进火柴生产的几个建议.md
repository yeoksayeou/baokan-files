Replies to Several Suggestions for Improving Match Production

    Our newspaper and the Department of Local Industries often receive letters from people in various regions with many suggestions for improving match production. Many of these suggestions have been adopted by relevant departments and have played a significant role in improving production; some suggestions, however, are not in line with the requirements of match production and use, and therefore cannot be adopted. The Department of Local Industries now provides brief answers to these suggestions:

    Is it possible to use bamboo, hemp stalks, paper ropes, reed stalks, etc., to make matchsticks in order to save wood?

    The raw materials for making matchsticks are required to be soft, with good capillary action of the fibers, and easy to burn. On the other hand, they must also have a certain degree of toughness and elasticity to prevent breakage during production and use. Bamboo, hemp stalks, reed stalks, etc., do not meet these requirements, so they cannot be used. In order to save logs, the match industry should make full use of waste materials and scraps from wood, and pay attention to reducing or eliminating waste products during production.

    Is it possible to make the medicine-coated end of the matchstick thinner to save raw materials?

    Making the medicine-coated end of the matchstick thinner saves very little medicine and wood. However, the bending resistance of the stick is reduced, which can lead to waste during use; the uneven thickness of the stick will also increase many difficulties in production. Therefore, this is not appropriate.

    Is it possible to sell loose matches?

    The animal glue in match heads is very hygroscopic and easily deteriorates when exposed to air. Moreover, it is prone to friction and ignition when vibrated, which is very unsafe for transportation and storage. Therefore, selling loose matches has more disadvantages than advantages.

    Is it possible to recycle old matchboxes to save wood?

    The cost of making matchboxes is very low. Recycling old matchboxes for processing and reuse not only requires re-pasting the boxes and applying phosphorus, but also involves certain operating, storage, and transportation costs. Empty boxes are also very easy to break during the recycling process. Therefore, doing so is uneconomical.

### 答复改进火柴生产的几个建议

    答复改进火柴生产的几个建议
    本报和地方工业部经常收到各地群众来信，对改进火柴生产提出了很多建议。有不少建议已经经有关部门采纳了，对改进生产起了很好的作用；也有一部分建议由于不合火柴生产和使用的要求，因而是不能采纳的。现由地方工业部对这些建议简复如下：
    是否可以利用竹子、麻秆、纸绳、芦苇秆等制造火柴梗，以节省木材？
    制造火柴梗的原料，一方面要求质地松柔，纤维毛细管作用好，易于燃烧；另一方面还要求有一定的坚韧性和弹性，在生产和使用过程中不易折断。竹子、麻杆、芦苇杆等都不能符合这些要求，因此是不能采用的。为了节约原木，在火柴工业中应该尽量利用木材的废材、废料，并且注意在生产过程中减少或消灭废品。
    是否可以把火柴梗沾药的一端改细，以节省原料？
    把火柴梗沾药的一端改细，节约的药料和原木很少。但是，梗子的抗折力降低了，在使用中容易造成浪费；梗子的两端粗细不一，在生产中也会增加很多困难。因此，这样做是不合适的。
    是否可以出售散装火柴？
    火柴药头中的动物胶吸水性很大，露在空气中容易变质，而且震动时容易摩擦起火，在运输、保管上很不安全。因此，出售散装火柴是利少弊多的。
    是否可以回收旧火柴盒，以节约木材？
    制造火柴盒的成本很低。回收旧火柴盒加工利用，不但需要重新糊盒刷磷，而且还要付出一定的经营、保管和运输费用，空盒在回收过程中也非常容易破裂。因此，这样做是不经济的。
