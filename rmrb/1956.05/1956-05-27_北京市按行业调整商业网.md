Xinhua News Agency Report:

    Beijing has adjusted its commercial network by industry. Currently, more than 30 industries, including department stores, cultural and educational supplies, clothing, shoes and hats, and catering, have completed adjustments according to plan. Only a few industries are still being adjusted.

    This adjustment is mainly based on the principle of convenience for the public, with reference to the service targets, business conditions, and distribution of various industries. Service points have been added or removed, and business operations have been merged or centralized. Approximately 1,200 households in seven industries, including mineral oil, paint, hardware, bricks, tiles, ash, hemp, and electrical materials, which have less to do with citizens' lives and mainly serve institutions, organizations, and industrial and mining enterprises, have been adjusted and merged into more than 400 households. Industries that are closely related to residents' lives, such as daily necessities, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and pork, have generally not been changed, with only individual adjustments made. Lianjia shops are generally not touched except for those that need to be adjusted. In addition, six comprehensive shopping malls have been newly built in the suburbs.

    Shops that have been merged or centralized have expanded their sales floors and increased their variety of goods. After thirty catering stall vendors moved to Baiguang Road and Hepingli, which previously had no restaurants, their business increased two to three times compared to the past.

    北京市按行业调整商业网
    北京市按行业调整了商业网。目前全市百货、文教用品、服装、鞋帽、饮食等三十多个行业都按规划调整完毕，只有个别行业还在调整。
    这次调整主要是根据便利群众购买的原则，参照各行业的服务对象、营业状况和分布情况，分别增设或撤销服务点，实行合并经营或集中经营。和市民生活关系不大、主要以机关团体、工矿企业为服务对象的矿油、颜料、五金、砖瓦灰麻、电料等七个行业一千二百多户，经过调整合并成为四百多户；和居民生活关系较密切的日用小百货、油盐酱醋、猪肉等行业，一般都没有动，只作了个别调整。连家铺除了必需调整的以外，一般不动。另外还在郊区新建了六个综合性商场。
    经过合并或集中的商店，都扩大了货场，增加了品种。有三十户饮食摊商迁到过去没有饮食店的白广路和和平里后，营业比过去增加二、三倍。
