Xinhua News Agency, 27th - According to the Ministry of Agriculture: Over six million hectares of cotton fields across the country have been planted.

This year, the cotton planting season was generally ten to fifteen days earlier than in previous years. In previous years, the cotton planting season lasted about one month, but this year, due to the development of the cooperative movement, the planting season in many areas has been shortened to ten days.

The cotton field area this year has expanded by more than 300,000 hectares compared to last year. The expanded cotton fields are mainly distributed in major cotton-producing areas such as Hebei, Shanxi, and Shandong provinces.

The vast majority of cotton fields this year have been planted with high-yield, long-fiber, improved varieties of cotton. The amount of fertilizer applied per hectare of cotton field has more than doubled compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 27th - Farmers in cotton-producing areas of Shanxi Province have planted a large number of cotton seedlings specifically cultivated for transplanting to fill gaps in the cotton fields. After checking and replanting, all five million mu of cotton fields in the province have been densely planted with six to seven thousand plants per mu.

During the seedling checking and replanting campaign, as many as 300,000 male and female members of the Yuci Special District participated in checking and replanting, vigorously using cultivated cotton seedlings for transplanting. In order to ensure dense planting and full seedlings in the cotton fields, agricultural cooperatives in cotton-producing areas of the province cultivated cotton seedlings specifically for transplanting at the same time as planting cotton. Most agricultural cooperatives in the Jinnan Plain area used the edges of fields and embankments to cultivate cotton seedlings in the fields, and agricultural cooperatives along the Fen River in Jinzhong carried out dense planting and seedling cultivation in some cotton fields. When farmers discovered missing seedlings in the cotton fields, they launched transplanting operations.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 28th - Anhui Province has completed its plan to plant nine million mu of early rice for double-season rice. This is a tenfold increase compared to last year's double-season rice planting area. Now, the transplanted seedlings have survived, and farmers are busy weeding.

Changing from single-season rice to double-season rice is one of the specific measures taken by Anhui Province to promote the three major production reforms. This year, the area planted with double-season rice in Anhui Province is the largest since the implementation of the "three reforms." As changing to double-season rice has resulted in significant increases in production in recent years, agricultural production cooperatives in rice-growing areas are even more enthusiastic about changing to double-season rice this year. In order to strive for increased early rice production, agricultural production cooperatives in various places have universally built suitable seedling fields, all used improved varieties, and 80% used salt water and mud water for seed selection and baking soda for seed soaking when sowing, resulting in strong and robust seedlings. Before transplanting, agricultural cooperatives in various places also held forums for experienced farmers and technicians to exchange and promote experience in planting double-season rice, universally achieving dense planting of large seedlings, transplanting with fertilizer-coated seedlings, and applying sufficient base fertilizer.

Anhui Province, along both sides of the Yangtze River and in the Huainan hilly area, has a mild climate with an annual frost-free period of 240 to 250 days and an average temperature of 14 to 17 degrees Celsius, making it perfectly suitable for planting double-season rice.

Xinhua News Agency, Songjiang, 28th - The 568,000 mu of early double-season rice seedlings in Songjiang Special District, Jiangsu Province, are strong and growing vigorously. The densely planted and shallowly transplanted rice fields resemble green brocade woven with fine-grid patterns, both neat and beautiful, and are the most attractive crop in the fields. At present, agricultural cooperatives have generally applied the first top dressing of fast-acting fertilizer to the rice fields, and weeding is underway.

This year is the first year of large-scale double-season rice planting in Songjiang Special District, and special attention is paid to cultivation techniques. Field preparation is more meticulous than in previous years, base fertilizer is sufficient, and technical requirements such as timely transplanting according to seedling quantity are strictly followed. The transplanted seedlings are all strong seedlings no less than four inches in height, so they quickly turn green and survive. Direct-seeded rice has been thinned and replanted to meet density requirements. Each agricultural cooperative has dedicated personnel responsible for irrigation, conscientiously ensuring shallow and frequent irrigation. The water in the fields is fresh because it is constantly changed, and there is no algae. Each field has opened a "standard gap" so that excess rainwater can overflow from the gap.

### 全国六百多万公顷棉田提前播种完毕  安徽省双季稻早稻栽种面积比去年扩大了十倍

    全国六百多万公顷棉田提前播种完毕
    安徽省双季稻早稻栽种面积比去年扩大了十倍
    新华社27日讯　据农业部消息：全国六百多万公顷棉田已经播种完毕。
    今年棉花播种期一般比往年提早了十天到十五天。往年棉花播种期大约一月，今年由于合作化运动的发展，许多地区的播种期缩短为十天。
    今年棉田面积比去年扩大了三十多万公顷。扩大的棉田主要分布在河北省、山西省和山东省等主要产棉区。
    绝大多数的棉田今年播种了纤维长、产量高的良种棉花。每公顷棉田的施肥量比去年增加了一倍以上。
    据新华社太原27日电　山西省产棉地区的农民，在棉田中栽植了大量的专为补苗培育的棉苗。经过查苗补苗以后，全省五百多万亩棉田，每亩都密植到六千到七千株。
    在查苗补苗运动中，榆次专区参加查苗补苗的男女社员即达三十万人，大力用培育的棉苗进行了移补。为了保证棉田密植全苗，这个省产棉地区的农业社，在种棉的同时就培育了专供移苗补栽的棉苗。晋南平川地区的大部分农业社利用地边地堰进行地头培育棉苗，晋中沿汾河两岸农业社在部分棉田进行了稠植育苗。当农民们发现棉田缺苗后，就展开了移栽工作。
    新华社合肥28日电　安徽省今年栽种九百万亩双季稻早稻的计划已经完成。这比去年栽种双季稻的面积扩大了十倍。现在，栽下的秧苗已经成活，农民正忙着耘草。
    把单季稻改为双季稻是安徽省推行生产三项改革的具体措施之一。今年，安徽省栽种双季稻的面积是推行“三改”以来最多的一年。由于几年来改种双季稻得到大量增产，因此，今年水稻地区的农业生产合作社对改种双季稻更加积极。为了争取早稻增产，各地农业生产合作社都普遍做了合式秧田，全部采用了良种，在播种时有80％用盐水、泥水选种，用小苏打浸种，培育的秧苗又壮又肥。栽秧之前，各地农业社还召开了老农和技术员的座谈会，交流和推广了种双季稻的经验，普遍做到大棵密植，拖盆沾肥栽秧，施足了基肥。
    安徽省长江两岸和淮南丘陵地区气候温和，每年无霜期是二百四十天到二百五十天，平均温度在摄氏十四度到十七度，完全适合栽种双季稻。
    新华社松江28日电　江苏省松江专区五十六万八千亩双季稻早稻秧苗健壮，开始发棵。密植浅栽的稻田像织有细格图案的绿色锦缎，又整齐，又漂亮，是田野上最吸引人的一种作物。现在，农业社已经普遍在稻田里追施了第一次速效肥料，耘稻除草工作正在紧张进行。
    今年是松江专区大面积种植双季稻的第一年，在栽培技术方面特别重视。大田整地比往年更加精细，基肥很足，并严格掌握了量苗及时移栽等技术要求，移栽的苗都是不低于四寸的壮秧，所以转青活棵很快。直播的经过匀苗补苗，密度也都符合要求。各个农业社都有专人负责灌溉，认真做到浅水勤灌，田里的水因为常换都很新鲜，没有青苔。每块田都开了“标准缺”，过多的雨水可从缺口溢出。
