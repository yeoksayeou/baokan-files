    Hou Yufeng's Troubles
    Wei Junyi
    Hou Yufeng, a young female Communist Party member, is a saleswoman at the Dalian Department Store, a special-class model worker of Dalian, and a representative attending the National Conference of Advanced Producers.
    However, she is now feeling troubled. Her trouble is that she cannot work as a salesperson, and may not be able to complete her tasks.
    I went to visit her. She talked about her past achievements. As she talked, she suddenly stood up and found a printed document from the cabinet, smiling and saying, "Actually, it's all on here...." But when she talked about her troubles, she became agitated and began to pour out her heart.
    How could you not expect her to be agitated? She is a special-class model worker, but in the first quarter of this year, the time she spent working was less than half of the prescribed working days. What did she do the rest of the time? She attended meetings. Meetings convened by the company were not the main issue; the main thing was going out to give reports, to stores, factories, schools, cooperatives... outside the company to report on advanced deeds.
    She bowed her head and calculated that she had given more than thirty reports outside in the first quarter of this year alone. The Young Pioneers wanted to find her because they wanted to learn the noble qualities of a model worker striving for socialist construction; the trade union wanted to find her because they wanted to learn advanced experience; she should report to women's organizations because she is an advanced producer among women; of course, she should also go to the Communist Youth League branch to spend League Day with the students because she is also a youth and a member of the Dalian Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League... All these units that made requests had good reasons, and it was not right to refuse them. They found the leaders of the department store and asked for a slip to let Hou Yufeng go, so Hou Yufeng went. She went during rest time, during study time, and even during working time. In addition to giving reports, sometimes she had to write materials and draft articles. When she joined the department store in 1952, she had only studied for a little over a year. After several years of hard work, she has now reached the level of senior primary school. But writing is still not easy for her. It often takes her several days to write something according to the topic specified by others. In addition, there are many youth, women's, and trade union meetings to attend, social activities to participate in, and naturally, many business meetings should also be held (she is the deputy leader of the shoe group), and Party meetings have to be held (she is also the Party group leader).
    Their store stipulates that they start studying at 6:30 in the morning, go to work at 8:30, have a three-hour break in the middle, and get off work at 8:30 in the evening. She rarely gets a rest during her lunch break. It's either meetings or reports. If that doesn't work, then she has to take up working time. Speaking of the morning study time, I thought that there probably wasn't much of a problem, because it was too early. But she said, "Not at all! Some units ask you to give a report at seven o'clock in the morning!" Her home is also very far from her workplace, and it takes an hour to walk there. Therefore, she has to get up at four in the morning every day. After getting off work, there is always something else to do at the company, and she gets home no earlier than 9:30, and it's very common to get home at eleven. After tidying up a bit and then going to bed, she only gets four or five hours of sleep each night. She, a twenty-one-year-old girl from a farming family, is now riddled with illness: anemia, and headaches as soon as she uses her brain.
    This serious situation had attracted attention. A reporter from the Dalian Daily visited her and, after understanding the situation, wrote an article and published it. Speaking of this, she smiled and said to me in a low voice as if explaining, "It's better, it's better. The leaders have already paid attention to it." Originally, she held six positions concurrently, but now it has been reduced to three positions (not counting the position of salesperson). But when I asked her if the units asking her to give reports had decreased and whether the actual situation had improved, she lowered her head and said: It hasn't decreased much. Even on the day she left for Beijing to attend this conference, there was still a request for her to give a report. Because it was really impossible, the company leaders turned it down on her behalf. Her fellow salespeople in the group said, "Forget it! Transfer Hou Yufeng out of sales and let her do those jobs exclusively!"
    But she herself does not have the idea of not wanting to be a salesperson. She loves this job. She likes standing in the sales area and seeing customers buy what they need and walk out the door happily carrying packages and boxes. She likes to see the large quantities of products produced in the factory being delivered to consumers through her hands. Whenever she sees the smiling faces of these customers buying what they want, she feels that she has done something for the people. She has a sense of professional pride. When she was transferred from a shoe factory to work as a salesperson in 1952, she happily said, "I never thought I could do this." She never thought that so many valuable goods could be entrusted to her to manage, and that she, without much education and unable to write or calculate, could handle such a job. She accepted this job with a feeling of joy and worry.
    She is indeed an excellent salesperson and has had many touching little stories. For example, an old lady came to the store to buy shoes for bound feet, but could not find any, saying, "The new society promotes big feet, and you can't buy shoes for small feet." Hou Yufeng left the old lady's foot size and suggested that the shoe factory process it. Once it was done, she would notify the old lady to come and buy them. A worker from a chemical factory came to buy shoes and wanted to take them away without trying them on. Hou Yufeng guessed that he must be embarrassed to try them on because he was afraid his feet were dirty, so she handed him a piece of paper to wipe his feet and insisted that he try them on and buy them only if they fit. There are many such stories. Her sales are not just about expanding sales to complete tasks. She carefully studies everyone's needs, considers what they are buying for, and carefully thinks about summarizing the rules from this. For example, because People's Liberation Army soldiers often have to drill and run, she always advises them to buy slightly larger sizes of suede high-top shoes, which are not tight, are wear-resistant and impact-resistant, and are very durable. Once, a People's Liberation Army soldier came to buy shoes. She helped him choose and helped him try them on. He put on these perfectly fitting shoes and happily thanked Hou Yufeng before leaving. Later, this comrade often brought some people to ask Hou Yufeng to help them choose shoes. Sometimes they didn't buy shoes, but they also came to see her and became friends with her. They told her stories about the army and asked her to tell them about the knowledge of leather, what are the properties of horse leather, how to protect pigskin... They asked her, "Are you a graduate of a leather school?"
    In fact, what kind of leather school did she graduate from? She just loves her job very much and studies hard. She once visited a leather shoe factory to understand the manufacturing process and repair methods of various leather shoes. Some customers complained that suede shoes could not be brushed with powder, so she went to the shoe factory workers to learn and learned how to rub suede shoes with sandpaper and then brush them with powder. She is really willing to learn, and she feels that there are many, many things to study in this industry, where is it just enough to have a kind attitude? As soon as she arrived in Beijing, she planned to go to the department store and Wangfujing stores to learn about other people's methods of displaying goods, and also to see other people's shoe styles. After participating in the conference, she felt that the experience of Wu Guilan, a salesperson at the Harbin Department Store, in organizing sources of goods was particularly worth learning, and she planned to learn it when she went back. She is also busy writing letters back, asking the comrades in the group to pay attention to taking care of several female comrades with children and encourage them to continue to make progress.
    But, despite these plans, what is bothering her now is how to have the possibility of realizing these plans. No matter what the plan, first of all, you have to go to work to realize the plan. A salesperson must first go to sell, and then talk about other things. She is now a model worker, an advanced producer, but she almost did not complete the task in the last quarter. The tasks set by their company for each salesperson are not generally large. Probably the leaders also considered Hou Yufeng's situation of often being unable to go to work, and the tasks assigned to her were not the highest. Her task was more than 5,000 yuan, while others had more than 6,000 yuan. But even this task, which was not the highest, was still far short of completion by the end of the quarter. She originally worked less than half the time, which really worried her. A model worker in the city, but failing to complete the task in her own unit and not being rated as an excellent salesperson, that would not be good! She rushed to sell goods with all her strength in the last month. As soon as she got to work, she didn't ask anything else, just focused on selling goods, and finally managed to complete the task. What a close call!
    But who is to blame for this situation? She was originally a very good salesperson and willing to learn humbly. She could have done even better than she is now. Whenever she mentions the current situation, she smiles helplessly and says, "Of course, giving those reports is also necessary, and it is necessary to help cultivate socialist successors..." But it is difficult to continue speaking. This situation is inherently difficult to speak about! She cannot but be troubled. Finally, I asked her what other plans and hopes she had, and what she said was: "It would be good if I could go back and sell goods properly. Is that possible?"
    Is that possible? She should get an answer. Her troubles should be relieved and she should be given a positive answer.

    侯玉凤的苦恼
    韦君宜
    年轻的女共产党员侯玉凤是旅大市百货公司售货员，旅大市特等劳动模范，是出席全国先进生产者代表会议的代表。
    可是，她现在正感到苦恼。她的苦恼是不能去售货，可能要完不成任务。
    我去访问她，她谈到自己过去的事迹，谈着谈着，忽然站起来从柜子里找出一份印好的材料，微笑着说：“其实，这上面都有……。”但是，当谈到她的这种苦恼的时候，她激动地诉说起来了。
    你叫她怎么能不激动呢？她是特等劳动模范，可是，在今年的第一季度，她上班工作的时间还不到规定的工作日的一半。其余的时间干什么去了呢？都开了会。公司里召集的会还不是主要的，最主要的是出去作报告，到公司以外的商店、工厂、学校、合作社……去报告先进事迹。
    她低头算了算，单是今年第一季度到外面去作的报告，就有三十多次。少年先锋队要找她，因为他们要向劳动模范学习为社会主义建设而奋斗的高尚品质；工会要找她，因为他们要学习先进经验；她应当给妇女团体报告，因为她是妇女当中的先进生产者；当然也应该到青年团支部去和学生们一起过团日，因为她也是青年，而且是旅大团市委的委员……所有这些提出要求的单位都是很有理由的，不应该拒绝的。他们找到百货公司领导上，要求批个条子让侯玉凤去，于是侯玉凤就去了。在休息时间去，学习时间去，工作时间也要去。除了作报告之外，有时候还要她写材料，写稿子。她在1952年参加百货公司工作的时候，只读过一年多书，经过几年的勤奋学习，现在达到了高小程度。但是写文章对于她终于还不是容易的事，按人家指定的题目写一篇东西，常常又得好几天。此外，还有许多青年的、妇女的、工会的会要开，社会活动要参加，自然还应当开业务上的许多会（她是鞋组的副组长），得开党的会（她又是党小组长）。
    她们的商店规定，每天清早六点半钟开始学习，八点半钟上班，中间有三小时休息，晚上八点半钟下班。她在午休时间，是很少捞得着休息的。不是开会就是报告。再不行，自然就得占用工作时间。说到早晨的学习时间，我本以为那大概是没有多大问题的了，因为太早了。但是她说：“才不呢！有些单位叫你清早七点钟就去作报告！”她的家离服务地点又很远，路上走就要一个来钟头。因此每天都是四点多钟就得起床，晚上下了班，总是公司里还有点别的事，到家最早也得九点半，十一点到家那是很平常的事。再稍微收拾收拾而后睡觉，每夜总不过睡上四、五个钟头。二十一岁农家姑娘出身的她，现在已经浑身是病：贫血，一用脑就头疼。
    这种严重情况曾经引起过注意。旅大日报的记者访问过她，了解了这情况后，曾经写过稿子发表。说到这里，她含笑向我解释似地轻声说：“好些了，好些了。现在领导上已经注意到了。”原来是身兼六职，现在减为身兼三职（售货员这一职不算）。但是当我问到她，现在请她作报告的单位是不是已经减少，实际情况是不是已经改善的时候，她却低下头去说：并没有怎么减少。一直到她这次来北京出席大会动身的那天，还有一起请她作报告的事，因为这实在不可能了，公司领导上才代为回掉了。和她同组的售货员同志都说：“算了吧！调侯玉凤不做售货员，专去做那些工作吧！”
    但是她本人并没有不愿做售货员的思想。她爱这个工作。她喜欢站在卖场里看见一个一个顾客买到了他们所需要的东西，高高兴兴挟着包裹和盒子走出门去。她喜欢看见工厂里生产出来的大量生产品从她的手里送到了消费者的手里。每当看到这些顾客买到合意东西的笑脸的时候，她就感觉到自己是为人民做了一件事。她是有职业的荣誉感的。当1952年，她刚由一个鞋厂的杂工调做售货员的时候，她就高兴地说：“想不到我能做这个。”想不到值那么多钱的许多商品能交给自己来经营，想不到自己又没有文化，不会写不会算，能担当得了这样的工作。她是怀着又欢喜又担心的心情来接受这一个工作的。
    她确是一个优秀的售货员，有过很多动人的小故事。例如有个老太太来到商店要买小脚鞋，买不到，说：“新社会兴大脚，小脚买不到鞋。”侯玉凤就把老太太的脚尺寸留下，建议鞋厂加工，等做得了就通知老太太来买。一个化学厂工人来买鞋，不肯试穿就要拿走，侯玉凤猜到他一定是怕脚脏不好意思试，就递给他一张纸擦擦脚，一定要他试穿合适了再买走，……这样的故事不少。她卖货不是仅仅为扩大推销完成任务就算完了的，她是细心研究了每个人的需要，考虑他们买东西是作什么用的，并且仔细思索，从这里面总结出规律来。譬如：解放军战士是经常要出操、跑路的，她就总劝他们买尺码稍大一些的反皮高腰鞋，穿起来不挤脚，又耐磨抗碰，很结实。有一次一个解放军战士来买鞋，她帮他挑，又帮他试，他穿上这双完全合适的鞋，临走高兴地谢了侯玉凤，以后这位同志常领一些人来找侯玉凤帮他们挑鞋，有时候不买鞋他们也来看看她，同她成了朋友。他们给她讲部队里的故事，要她讲关于皮革的知识给他们听，马皮有什么性能，猪皮怎样保护……他们问她：“你是皮革学校毕业的吗？”
    其实她是什么皮革学校毕业的呢？她只是很爱自己的工作，而且用心学习罢了。她曾经到皮鞋厂参观，了解各种皮鞋的制造过程和整修方法。有的顾客嫌反皮鞋刷不上粉，她就去向鞋厂工人学习，学会了反皮鞋用砂纸擦了再刷粉的方法。她实在愿意学习，而且觉得这一行有很多很多可钻研的东西，哪里只是态度和蔼就行了的呢？一到北京，她就打算去百货大楼和王府井各商店学习学习人家商品摆设的方法，还要看看人家的鞋样子。参加了大会，她觉得哈尔滨百货商店售货员吴桂兰组织货源的经验特别值得学习，打算回去就学。她还在忙着写信回去，要组里的同志注意照顾几个有孩子的女同志，鼓励她们继续进步。
    但是，虽然有这些计划，现在苦恼着她的却还是怎样能有实现这些计划的可能。不论有什么计划，首先总得要去工作才能实现计划。一个售货员首先总得去售货，然后才能谈别的。她现在是劳动模范，先进生产者，可是，却险些儿没有完成上季度的任务。她们公司里对每个售货员规定的任务并不是一般多，大概领导上也考虑到了侯玉凤这种经常没法上班工作的情况了吧，给她规定的任务并不是最高的。她的任务是五千多元，别人还有六千多元的。但是，就是这个并不算最高的任务，也是到了季度底还差大半截。她本来上班工作的时间还不到一半，那可真把她急坏了。一个市里的劳动模范，却在本单位完不成任务，评不上优秀售货员，那还成什么话！她赶着在最末一月拼命集中火力卖货。一赶到班上，别的什么也不问，只顾卖货，最后总算还是完成任务了。好险哪！
    可是，这种情形怪谁？她本来是个很好的售货员，而且愿意虚心钻研业务。她可以做得还比现在更好的。一提到目前这种情形，她就无可奈何地微笑着说：“当然，作那些报告也都是应该的，应该帮助培养社会主义的接班人……”可是底下就很难说下去了。这种情况本来是说不下去嘛！她不能不苦恼。最后我问她还有什么打算和希望，她说的就是：“能让我回去好好地售货就好了。能吗？”
    能不能呢？她应当得到答复。应当解除她的苦恼，给她肯定的回答。
