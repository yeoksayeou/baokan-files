"The First Domestically Produced Unit"
By our reporter Yu Ming

The first set of 6,000-kilowatt power generating equipment manufactured and installed by our own country was officially put into production at the Huainan Power Plant at the end of April. This set of equipment stands side by side with the original sets of power generating equipment manufactured by capitalist countries. It is lighter than them, but its power generation is greater. The manufacturing unit clearly marked it with the number "○○○一"; the construction and installation unit inlaid the words "First Domestically Produced Unit" in large red characters and a peace dove on the terrazzo floor in front of it. This shows how excited the workers who manufactured and installed it were about this new product of the motherland.

How can people not be excited! If our country is to achieve industrialization, we must develop the power industry, but our country did not manufacture steam turbine generating equipment in the past. Now that our country has manufactured the first set of steam turbine generating equipment and installed it ourselves, this shows that the great development of our power industry has a preliminary foundation and has begun to embark on the road of technological self-sufficiency. Needless to say, the people who participated in the construction, every one in the motherland will be excited about this construction achievement when they hear this news.

The operation of this set of power generating equipment has been very good since the trial production. The steam turbine generator reached its rated 3,000 revolutions per minute during operation, reaching the design standard of 6,000 kilowatts of full load output. The record-type seismograph proved that the main bearing of the steam turbine generator had no vibration. The boiler, which is several stories high, has no water or gas leaks. All kinds of complex control equipment in the main control room are also very flexible.

This set of power generating equipment was manufactured by Shanghai and dozens of mechanical factories across the country. Soviet, especially Czechoslovak, experts have given concrete help in all aspects. The Shanghai Steam Turbine Plant, which is responsible for manufacturing the steam turbine, was previously only a repair and distribution factory with poor technical level and equipment conditions. The steam turbine has thousands of blades, and it is required to embed the root of each blade into the impeller with high precision. Under the guidance of Czechoslovak experts, workers improved the processing and assembly methods to achieve fast and good results. The main shaft of the steam turbine is too long, and the steam turbine plant does not have a grinder to process such a long main shaft. The workers came up with the idea of installing a grinding wheel driven by a motor on the tool holder to grind it. It is difficult to see the precision of the cylinder using old machines to process the cylinder. Labor model Yang Jinquan came up with the idea of installing a dial indicator on the tool holder to ensure the precision of the cylinder processing.

The boiler with a steam evaporation of 40 tons per hour is also manufactured for the first time in our country. The employees of the Shanghai Boiler Plant, who are responsible for manufacturing, always study the process, practice the operation, and then formally manufacture when processing the grate shaft and steam drum holes to ensure that there is no mistake. The thread of the automatic coal adding shaft is wide and deep, which is difficult to process. After the workers' research, the working method was improved, and the problem was solved.

This set of power generating equipment was installed by the employees of the Twenty-first Engineering Office of the Shanghai Basic Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry. In the beginning, the installation quality was not good enough. After the engineering office strengthened its leadership and strengthened the education of employees, the majority of employees understood the importance of ensuring installation quality and improved the installation methods. The quality of the alignment of the turbine and generator is related to the quality of the entire installation. If the error exceeds five threads, vibration will occur, shortening the life of the machine or causing accidents. After the turbine installation team aligned the coupling, the team leader Huang Rongcheng measured the error and found that it was as much as seventeen threads. Huang Rongcheng and the workers aligned it for a whole day to reduce the error to five threads. However, Gao Shixiu, the deputy director of the turbine installation site, thought about it at night that this was the first domestically produced turbine. If the installation quality does not meet the requirements, how bad would that be! The next day, he asked Huang Rongcheng to continue to align it until the error was equal to zero. It became more and more difficult for the workers to reduce the error to three threads. Gao Shixiu had higher skills and aligned it himself. He aligned and measured, measured and aligned, and the error was reduced from three threads to two threads, one and a half threads, until the error could not be measured. Through the efforts of the construction and installation workers, it was guaranteed that the turbine had no vibration. Czechoslovak experts happily called Gao Shixiu a "Chinese expert."

The representative of the Turbine Plant stationed at the Huainan Power Plant said that the smooth manufacturing and installation of the first 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine generating equipment is a great encouragement to everyone. He said that now that the 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine generating equipment has been successfully manufactured, it has opened up the road for manufacturing larger steam turbine generating equipment in the future.

    “国产第一台”
    本报记者　于明
    我国自己制造和自己安装的第一套六千瓩的发电设备，四月底在淮南电厂正式投入生产了。这一套设备同原有的几套资本主义国家制造的发电设备并排着。它比它们轻巧，可是发电量却比它们的大。制造单位在它的身上显明地标上了“○○○一”的编号；建筑安装单位，在它头前的水磨石地上嵌镶了“国产第一台”几个大红字和一只和平鸽。这表明制造和安装它的工人们，是怀着多么兴奋的心情对待祖国的这一新产品。
    人们怎能不兴奋呢！我国要实现工业化，就要发展电力工业，可是我国过去却不制造汽轮发电设备。现在我国制造了第一套汽轮发电设备，而且自己把它安装起来，这就表明我国电力工业的大发展有了初步基础，并且开始走上技术自给的道路了。不用说亲手参加建设的人，就是祖国的每一个人听到这个消息，都会为这一建设成就感到兴奋的。
    这套发电设备试生产以来，运转情况十分良好。汽轮发电机在运转中，每分钟达到了额定的三千转，达到了设计标准六千瓩满负荷出力。经过记录式测震器测定证明，汽轮发电机的主轴承没有震动。数层楼高大的锅炉，没有任何漏水漏气的现象。主控制室各种复杂的控制设备，也都很灵便。
    这套发电设备由上海和全国几十个机械工厂制造，苏联特别是捷克斯洛伐克专家在各方面都给了具体帮助。负责制造汽轮机的上海汽轮机厂，以前只是一个修配的工厂，技术水平和设备条件差。汽轮机有几千个叶片，要把每一个叶片的叶根嵌到叶轮里，其精密度要求很高。在捷克斯洛伐克专家指导下，工人们改进了加工和装配方法，才做到了又快又好。汽轮机的主轴太长，汽轮机厂没有加工这样长主轴的磨床。工人们就想法在刀架上装了用马达拖动的沙轮来磨制。用老的机器加工汽缸，很难看出汽缸的精密度。劳动模范杨金泉就想法把千分表装到刀架上，才保证了汽缸加工的精密度。
    每小时蒸发量达四十吨的锅炉，在我国也是第一次制造的。负责制造的上海锅炉厂的职工们，在加工炉排轴和汽包孔的时候，总是先研究工序，实习操作，然后正式制造，才保证没一丝差错。自动加煤轴的螺纹既宽又深，很难加工，经过工人的研究，改进了工作方法，问题才得到解决。
    这一套发电设备是由电力工业部上海基本建设局第二十一工程处的职工们负责安装的。在开始的时候，安装质量不够好。经过工程处加强领导，加强对职工的教育以后，广大职工都懂得了保证安装质量的重要意义，改进了安装方法。汽轮机和发电机对轮安装的好坏，关系着整个安装的质量，如果误差超过五丝，那就要发生震动，缩短机器的寿命或发生事故。汽轮机安装小组把对轮安装好以后，小组长黄荣成一量误差，发现竟有十七丝之多。黄荣成和工人们对正了一整天，才把误差降低到五丝。可是，汽轮机安装工地副主任高士秀在夜里想到这是国产第一台汽轮机，万一安装质量达不到要求，那该多么不好啊！第二天他就要求黄荣成继续对正，直到误差等于零才行。工人们把误差降到三丝以后，工作就越来越困难了。高士秀技术较高，就自己对正。他对了又测量，测量了又对正，误差由三丝缩成二丝、一丝半，直到量不出误差为止。经过建筑安装工人这样的努力，保证了汽轮机的没有震动。捷克斯洛伐克专家高兴地称高士秀为“中国专家”。
    汽轮机厂驻淮南电厂的代表说，第一台六千瓩的汽轮发电设备，制造和安装这样顺利，对大家的鼓舞很大。他说，现在制造成功了六千瓩的汽轮发电设备，就给今后制造更大的汽轮发电设备开辟了道路。（附图片）
