    Chinese Commodity Exhibition in Cairo
    Liao Xunzhen
    Dozens of five-star red flags flutter in the wind along the Nile Bridge. Across the bridge stands a magnificent building, with green tiles and yellow walls, and a vermilion gate. When the lights are turned on at night, it appears even more splendid. People passing by cannot help but stop and gaze at it with curiosity and excitement. This is the Chinese Commodity Exhibition held in Cairo, the beautiful capital of our country in Egypt.
    On August 22nd last year, the governments of China and Egypt signed a trade agreement in Beijing. Article 7 of which stipulates: "Both parties agree to hold commodity exhibitions in each other's countries." This exhibition is the implementation of that agreement. The exhibition area is 5,000 square meters, with more than 3,000 exhibits. At the same time as the exhibition, Chinese films are shown and Chinese goods are sold.
    The exhibition officially opened on April 1st this year. According to the plan, the exhibition was to close on April 20th, but due to the enthusiastic and earnest requests of the audience, it had to be postponed twice. They said, "Let the Egyptian people take another look at lovely China!" In the twenty-five days, the number of visitors reached more than 200,000, including leaders of the Egyptian Republic government, members of the Revolutionary Guidance Committee, and ministers of various ministries, as well as Sudanese Prime Minister Azhari and Foreign Minister Mubarak Zarrouk. Visitors came not only from all parts of Egypt, such as Alexandria, Aswan, Liberation Province, and El Mansoura, but also from Sudan, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and other Arab countries. Undoubtedly, the Chinese exhibition became the center of discussion in Egypt and even the Middle East for a time, and they all felt infinite joy in being able to see the Chinese exhibition. A Sudanese man specifically sent a telegram to his younger brother in Cairo: "I congratulate you because you have the opportunity to see the Chinese exhibition in Cairo." One young man immediately sent a telegram to his father in a distant place after visiting the exhibition, asking him to quickly take a plane to visit.
    More than 7,000 viewers left praise and thoughts after the visit. They gave high evaluations of the exhibition. Professor Sifisha of the Cairo Industrial School wrote: "I think this is the best exhibition I have ever seen in my life." When they saw the rapid development of China's heavy industry in recent years and the tremendous achievements of the Chinese people in economic construction, they were even more surprised and encouraged. Hassani Ibrahim, member of the Egyptian Revolutionary Guidance Committee and Minister of National Production, wrote: "I am pleased to see the progress of your great industry and the production of excellent technology. This is proof of complete recovery and tremendous development." Palestinian Islamic leader Muhammad Amin al-Husayni wrote: "I express my admiration for the miracles of your industrial development and the evidence of recovery and progress that I have seen." One viewer wrote: "This exhibition hall has given me a correct understanding of China. In the past, the British told us that China was an uncivilized slave country, but the exhibition hall gave us a true explanation. This is the greatest country of our time." Worker Hamet wrote: "Your industrial development will crush colonialism." Some viewers expressed the hope that "Asian and African countries will achieve the same progress in industry, because the largest country in Asia and Africa has already made outstanding progress."
    What the audience felt most intimate about was that the Chinese Exhibition Hall was full of Eastern atmosphere. As Akhmet Hilihe, who works in the arsenal, said: "I saw the magnificence, power, and beauty of the East in your pavilion." Alabi, a student at the Arabic Language Academy, wrote: "In the Chinese pavilion, I saw the dignity of the East, and I am full of confidence in the great giants of the East." Hassan Sobri, editor of the Cairo "News," said with great emotion after visiting the models of China's three major water conservancy projects: "In the past, we always learned from Britain, from Europe, from the West. When it came to China, we always shook our heads, thinking it wouldn't work. Now I should say that we should learn from the East, from Asia, from China."
    There is a sincere feeling and friendship between the people of China and Egypt. In the exhibition hall, Chinese staff were often surrounded by groups of Egyptian students and young people, asking for autographs, sending photos, leaving addresses, asking for books and newspapers, asking questions of all kinds. That's not all, they also wanted you to teach them to speak Chinese and write Chinese characters. In a few days, you could hear "hello," "thank you," and "goodbye" everywhere, greeting us. One young man even learned to write Chinese numbers "one, two, three, four, five" all the way to "ten" and his own Chinese name within a few hours. Another young man traced Chinese characters from our gift picture album "Happy Chinese Youth" and wrote them on a book "Three Years of the Egyptian Revolution" and sent it back to our machine workers. After visiting the textile machine performance, a female student enthusiastically took off her beloved racing medal from her neck and gave it to the female worker who performed the demonstration. Such touching examples often occurred in the museum.
    The friendship of the Chinese people towards the Egyptian people also left a deep impression on them. At the exhibition, there were two woolen embroideries, embroidered with the majestic pyramids, the Sphinx, and the sunny scenery of the Nile River. The audience was very interested in these two woolen embroideries. On April 16, after Ye Jizhuang, Minister of Foreign Trade of our country, donated 28 machines that were on display on behalf of the Chinese government to Egypt, many viewers specially ran over to carefully touch the machines and said, "Ah! This is what China gave us!"
    Chinese films have always been loved and welcomed by the masses at the exhibition. For more than twenty consecutive days, at least seven screenings were held every day, each was full, and the audience reached 150,000 people. Among them, the most popular were the color documentaries "Glorious Fifth Anniversary," "Chinese Acrobatic Troupe," and "Folk Sports Performance." When they saw the powerful force of the Chinese people displayed in the "Glorious Fifth Anniversary," they were very excited.
    "Chinese handicrafts such as wood carvings, ivory carvings, embroidery, carpets and porcelain are miracles." Hussein Fahmi, chairman of the Egyptian National Production Standing Committee, praised Chinese handicrafts in this way. When he saw the exquisite ivory carvings, he said humorously: "Just put one is enough, putting too many makes people like a young man standing in front of many beautiful girls, not knowing which one to choose." Chinese carpets were also well received by the audience. Every day, I don't know how many people surrounded the carpets to carefully study its quality and colors. Some people even used a magnifying glass to look at it, trying to find out why it was so good. This time, our country only brought nine carpets to Egypt, but the number of people registered to buy them reached as many as 120. Double-sided embroidery, lacquer carving, bamboo painting, and jade ware were also highly praised. Chinese goods aroused the strong interest of the broad masses of the Egyptian people. In the sales department, only a day or two after the opening, Beijing's straw-woven handbags, Guangdong mats, porcelain, etc., were quickly snapped up. People were extremely happy to be able to buy a Chinese item. One woman came six times in a row, because it was too crowded to buy, she ran to the office and earnestly asked to help her buy a handbag no matter what. As a result, she bought it and was very grateful. During the exhibition, we had extensive contact with Egyptian business circles. We talked to about 40 people every day, a total of about 1,000 people, to learn about commodity specifications, prices, etc. More than 130 formal trade negotiations were conducted, and nearly one million pounds of transactions were concluded. In addition, more than 20 kinds of our country's commodities have been designated as agents, such as tea, sewing machines, paper, bicycles, silk, thermos bottles, pens, etc., worth about one million pounds.
    The exhibition has come to a successful conclusion. The Egyptian people believe that the reason for such a successful exhibition is the result of the Asian-African Conference. They hope that such exhibitions should be widely held in the Middle East and African countries to promote mutual understanding among the people of various countries and economic ties between countries.

    中国商品展览会在开罗
    廖训振
    几十面五星红旗沿着尼罗河桥在迎风飘扬。桥对过出现一座规模宏大的建筑物，碧瓦黄墙，朱红大门，晚上灯光一亮，更显得壮丽辉煌。人们经过这里，无不怀着奇异和兴奋的心情，停下脚来站在路旁瞻望一番。这就是我国在埃及的美丽首都——开罗举行的商品展览会。
    去年八月二十二日，中埃两国政府曾经在北京签订一个贸易协定。其中第七条规定：“双方同意相互在对方国家举办商品展览”。现在这个展览会就是这条协定的实施。展览会展出面积五千平方公尺，展品三千多种。在展览的同时，还放映中国电影和出售中国物品。
    展览会是在今年四月一日正式开幕的，按照计划展览会到四月二十日闭幕，但是由于观众热烈恳切要求，不得不两次延期。他们说：“让埃及人民多看一眼可爱的中国吧！”在二十五天当中，参观人数达二十多万人，包括埃及共和国政府领导人、革命指导委员会委员们和各部部长，苏丹总理阿扎里和外交部长穆巴拉克·查鲁克。参观的人不仅来自埃及各地如亚历山大、阿斯旺、解放省、伦索等地，而且还来自苏丹、约旦、叙利亚、黎巴嫩等阿拉伯国家。无疑的，中国展览会在整个埃及甚至中东一时成为人们谈论的中心，他们都以能看到中国展览会感到无限喜悦。一个苏丹人特地为这件事打了一封电报给他在开罗的弟弟：“我祝贺你，因为你在开罗能有机会看见中国展览会。”一位青年在参观后当天立即打了电报给远地的父亲，要他赶快坐飞机来参观。
    有七千多位观众在参观后留下了赞语和感想。他们对展览会给予很高评价。开罗工业学校教授斯非沙写道：“我想这是我一生中看到的最好的展览会了。”当他们看到我国重工业在近几年来飞跃发展和我国人民在经济建设上所取得的巨大成就时，更感到惊奇和鼓舞。埃及革命指导委员会委员兼全国生产部部长哈萨尼·易卜拉欣写道：“当看到你们伟大工业的进步和优良的技术生产时，我感到愉快。这是彻底恢复和巨大发展的证明。”巴勒斯坦回教领袖穆罕默德·安密勒·侯赛尼写道：“我对所看到的你们工业发展的奇迹以及恢复和进步的证据表示钦佩。”有位观众这样写：“这个展览馆使我正确认识了中国，过去英国人对我们说中国是个未开化的奴隶国家，但是展览馆给予我们真实说明，这是我们时代中最伟大的国家。”工人哈枚特写道：“你们的工业发展将粉碎殖民主义”。有的观众表示希望“亚非国家在工业方面取得同样的进步，因为亚非最大的国家已经取得了出色的进步。”
    观众们感到最亲切的是中国展览馆充满着东方的气氛。如在兵工厂工作的阿赫枚特·希利赫说：“我在你们馆看到了东方的宏伟、强大和美丽。”阿拉伯文语文学院学生阿拉必写道：“在中国馆内我看到了东方的尊严，我对东方伟大的巨人充满信心。”开罗“消息报”编辑哈山·索布莱在参观了我国三大水利工程模型以后很感慨地说：“过去我们总是学英国，学欧洲，学西方，谈到中国总是摇头，认为不行的。现在我应该说要学东方，学亚洲，学中国了。”
    中埃两国人民之间存在着真挚的感情和友谊。在展览馆里，中国的工作人员经常被一群群埃及学生和青年团团围住，请签名，送像片，留地址，要书报，问长问短。这还不算，他们还要你教他说中国话，写中国字，不几天就到处听见“你好”、“谢谢”、“再见”，同我们打起招呼来了。有一位青年在几小时内还学会了中国的“一二三四五”一直到“十”的写法和自己中文的名字。另一位青年照着我们 送给他的画册“幸福的中国青年”，描出中国字，写在一本“埃及革命三周年”的书上回送给我们的机器工人。一位女学生在参观了纺织机表演后，热情地把自己心爱的赛跑奖章从脖子上取下来送给表演的女工。像这种动人的例子经常在馆内出现。
    中国人民对埃及人民的友情也给他们留下了深深的印象。在展览会上，有两幅毛绣，上边绣着巍峨的金字塔、人面狮身像和春光明媚的尼罗河风景。观众们对这两幅毛绣很感兴趣。四月十六日，我对外贸易部部长叶季壮代表我国政府向埃及赠送了正在展出的二十八台机器以后，许多观众特地跑来仔细摸摸机器说，“呀！这就是中国送给我们的！”
    中国电影在展览会内一直受到群众喜爱和欢迎。连续二十多天，每天放映至少七场，场场满座，观众达十五万人。其中最受欢迎的为彩色纪录片“光辉的五周年”、“中国杂技团”、“民间体育表演”。当他们看到“光辉的五周年”所显示出中国人民的强大力量时，感到非常兴奋。
    “中国手工艺品像木刻、象牙雕刻、刺绣、地毯和瓷器都是奇迹。”埃及国家生产常务委员会主席侯赛因·法赫密是这样赞赏着中国的手工艺品。当他看到精美的象牙雕刻时他很幽默地说：“摆一个就足够了，摆得多了就使人像年青人站在许多漂亮姑娘面前一样，不晓得选那一个好了。”中国的地毯同样受到观众的好评。每天围在地毯面前仔细研究它的质量花色的不知多少人。有人甚至用放大镜照一照，想办法找出它为什么这样好。这次我国带到埃及的地毯仅九块，但登记要买的人即达一百二十人之多。双面绣、雕漆、竹画、玉器，也受到很大赞赏。中国商品引起了埃及广大人民的浓厚兴趣，在卖品部里开幕才一两天，北京的草编手提篮、广东草席、瓷器等，很快就抢购一空。人们能买到一件中国东西，简直高兴得不得了。有一位妇女连续来了六次，因为人太挤买不到，结果跑到办公室恳切要求，无论如何帮她买到一个手提篮，结果买到了，她感激不尽。在展览期间，我们和埃及工商界人士进行了广泛的接触，每天接谈约四十人左右，共计约一千人向我们了解商品规格、价格等。正式商谈交易有130余家，做成了近百万英镑的交易。另外，还确定代理我国商品二十余种，如茶叶、缝纫机、纸张、自行车、丝绸、热水瓶、钢笔等，价值约一百万英镑。
    展览会已经胜利闭幕了。埃及人民认为这次能有这样成功的展览会，是由于亚非会议的结果。他们希望这样的展览会应该在中近东和非洲各国广泛举行，以促进各国人民之间的相互了解和国与国之间的经济联系。
