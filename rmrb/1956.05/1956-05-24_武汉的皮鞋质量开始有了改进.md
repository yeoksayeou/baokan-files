    Wuhan's Leather Shoe Quality Begins to Improve
    Zhang Wei

    At this year's National Merchandise Supply Conference, representatives from various regions, after examining the leather shoe samples from Wuhan, praised them, saying, "Wuhan's leather shoes have indeed improved!"

    In the early days after liberation, the leather shoes produced in Hankou were popular in the Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest regions because of their low prices and good quality. However, because Wuhan's production departments saw that the leather shoes sold well and orders came from all over the country, they began to produce them in a rough and slipshod manner, and the styles were also old-fashioned. Customers from various regions were dissatisfied. At the 1955 National Merchandise Supply Conference, Wuhan's leather shoes became unpopular items that no one inquired about. Tens of thousands of pairs of leather shoes were stockpiled in the warehouse of the Wuhan Merchandise Purchasing and Supply Station, and they could not be sold no matter what efforts were made.

    Starting in the second half of 1955, the Hubei Province Wuhan Merchandise Wholesale Station (formerly the Purchasing and Supply Station) and the Wuhan Municipal Department Store actively contacted the leather shoe production cooperatives to jointly study ways to improve leather shoe production. They believed that the only way to restore the reputation of Wuhan's leather shoes and reopen sales channels was to improve the style and quality of the leather shoes.

    They successively sent production technicians to Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, and other places to collect hundreds of leather shoe samples and models, and also learned production experience in the production factories in various places. After they returned to Wuhan, they organized production personnel to learn from the advanced experience of other places, study and improve the style of leather shoes, and trial-produce new styles of leather shoes. The Wuhan Municipal Leather United Production Cooperative established a sample-making group, and each leather shoe production cooperative also selected one or two skilled craftsmen to specialize in improving the style of leather shoes. In November of last year, the Wuhan Merchandise Wholesale Station and other units also sent people to Harbin, Shenyang, Zhangjiakou, Beijing, Tianjin, Zhengzhou, Nanning, Liuzhou, and other places to promote sales and collect specific opinions and preferences of consumers in various places regarding leather shoes.

    In order to ensure the quality of leather shoes, they implemented a production responsibility system of fixed quality, fixed quantity, fixed quotas, and fixed funds, correcting the past tendency of only focusing on completing the quantity of processing without regard to the quality. In the process of manufacturing leather shoes, they adopted a responsible attitude. In the past, after the leather shoes were lasted, they would be taken off on the same day, resulting in the shoes easily developing problems such as the toe collapsing and the heel sinking; now, after the shoes are lasted, they are generally taken off the next day. In addition, they also conscientiously do a good job in waxing the welts and sewing the shoes.

    As for the color of the leather shoes, although the state-owned animal products company only supplies black and yellow leather, the merchandise wholesale station mobilized the tanning production cooperatives to dye more than a dozen colors of leather. Now there are more than a dozen colors of leather shoes in the windows of department stores.

    The Wuhan Municipal Leather Shoe Production Cooperatives have trial-produced nearly three hundred new styles of leather shoes, which were successively introduced to customers in April of this year. At the National Merchandise Supply Conference, the new style leather shoe samples they trial-produced were welcomed by representatives from various regions, who placed orders with the Wuhan Merchandise Wholesale Station. Among the seventy-six units placing orders, some were department stores in Shenyang, Fushun, Qiqihar, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Nanning, Luoyang, and other places that had stopped ordering Wuhan leather shoes due to their poor quality, and some were department stores in Kunming, Mudanjiang, Inner Mongolia, and other places that had never ordered from Wuhan, but also began to order Wuhan leather shoes. In the first quarter of this year, the Wuhan Merchandise Wholesale Station supplied only 10,000 pairs of leather shoes to various places, while the order figure for the second quarter has reached 36,000 pairs, an increase of more than 80% compared with the same period last year.

    In the past, only three or two styles of yellow sandals were displayed in the leather shoe counters of the Wuhan Municipal Department Store's central store in the summer, but this year twenty or so new styles of sandals have already been displayed. One type of triangular women's sandals is very popular among customers because of its simple and beautiful style and lightweight feel. One type of "double-eye" women's shoes sometimes sells more than forty pairs a day. A type of square-toe, side-strap, bow-tie, medium-heel women's leather shoes manufactured by the Wuhan No. 8 Leather Shoe Production Cooperative has a generous and beautiful style and a low price. No matter how many pairs are sent to the central store every day, they are immediately sold out. Some female customers who cannot buy this type of shoe, or cannot buy shoes that fit, ask the salespersons: Why don't you prepare more of this type of shoe?

    Wuhan's leather shoes have begun to improve and are already being welcomed by the people. It is hoped that the production departments will continue to work hard so that people can wear satisfactory leather shoes.

    武汉的皮鞋质量开始有了改进
    张碨
    在今年全国百货供应会议上，各地代表看了武汉的皮鞋样品，都称赞：武汉的皮鞋确实改进了！
    解放初期，汉口生产的皮鞋因为价钱低、质量好，曾一度行销到东北、西北、西南等地。但是，武汉市的生产部门因为皮鞋销路好各地来订货的多，便粗制滥造起来，式样也是老一套。各地顾客都不满。在1955年的全国百货供应会议上，武汉的皮鞋变成了无人问津的冷门货。在武汉百货采购供应站的仓库里积压的几万双皮鞋，想尽办法也卖不出去。
    从1955年下半年开始，湖北省武汉百货批发站（即原来的采购供应站）和武汉市百货公司主动和皮鞋生产合作社联系，共同研究改进皮鞋生产的办法。他们认为要恢复武汉皮鞋的荣誉和重新打开销路的唯一办法，就是改进皮鞋的式样和质量。
    他们先后派出生产技师到上海、北京、广州等地搜集了数百种皮鞋样品和样本，并且在各地的生产工厂实地学习了生产经验。他们返回武汉后，又组织生产人员学习外地的先进经验，研究改进皮鞋式样，试制新式皮鞋。武汉市皮毛联合生产合作社设立了制样组，各皮鞋生产合作社也抽出一、二个技术好的师傅，专门负责改进皮鞋式样的工作。去年十一月武汉百货批发站等单位还派人到哈尔滨、沈阳、张家口、北京、天津、郑州、南宁、柳州等地推销，收集各地消费者对皮鞋的具体意见和爱好。
    他们为了保证皮鞋的质量，实行了定质、定量、定额、定资的生产负责制，纠正过去只管完成加工数量不管质量好坏的偏向。在制造皮鞋过程中，他们采取了认真负责的态度。过去皮鞋上了楦头之后，当天便取下来，结果皮鞋容易发生包头下塌，后跟下坐的情况；现在，在上了楦头之后，一般是隔天才取下来。另外，他们还认真作好皮鞋沿条打蜡和绱鞋等工作。
    至于皮鞋的颜色，虽然国营畜产公司只供应黑、黄两种皮子，但是百货批发站发动制革生产合作社多染了十几种颜色的皮子。现在百货商店的橱窗里，就有十几种颜色的皮鞋了。
    武汉市的皮鞋生产合作社已试制成了近三百种新式皮鞋，今年四月份陆续和顾客们见面了。在全国百货供应会议上，他们试制的新式皮鞋样品受到了各地代表的欢迎，纷纷向武汉百货批发站订货，在订货的七十六个单位中，有些是曾经因为武汉皮鞋质量不好而不再订购武汉皮鞋的沈阳、抚顺、齐齐哈尔、西安、兰州、南宁、洛阳等地的百货部门，还有些从未向武汉订过货的昆明、牡丹江、内蒙古等地的百货部门，也开始订购武汉的皮鞋。今年第一季度武汉百货批发站供应各地的皮鞋只有一万双，而第二季度的订货数字已达到了三万六千双，比去年同期供应数超过80％。
    武汉市百货公司中心门市部的皮鞋柜中，在往年的夏天只摆着三、二种式样的黄色凉鞋，而今年早已陈列着二十来种新式样的凉鞋。有一种三角形女凉鞋因为式样简单、美观，穿起来轻便，很受顾客欢迎。有一种双眼女鞋，有时每天能卖出四十多双。武汉市第八皮鞋生产合作社制造的一种方口边带蝴蝶结式的半高跟女皮鞋，式样大方、漂亮，价钱又低廉，不管每天送到中心门市部几双，都是立即卖光。有些女顾客买不到这种皮鞋，或买不到合脚的皮鞋，便问营业员：为什么不多准备这种皮鞋？
    武汉的皮鞋开始有了改进，已经受到人们的欢迎，希望生产部门继续努力，让人们能够穿到称心的皮鞋。
