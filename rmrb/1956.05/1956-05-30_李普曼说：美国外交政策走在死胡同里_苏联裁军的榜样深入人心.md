    Lippmann Says:
    American Foreign Policy is in a Dead End
    The Soviet Example of Disarmament is Deeply Rooted in People's Hearts
    American political commentator Walter Lippmann published articles in the "Washington Post" on May 17th and 22nd, discussing the trends in the world situation and American foreign policy, starting from the recent Soviet disarmament decision and Indonesian President Sukarno's visit to the United States.
    In his May 22nd article, Lippmann said that in terms of Asian policy, the United States "has been walking down a dead end."
    Lippmann pointed out that inviting Sukarno to visit the United States was to express "a new attitude of neutrality towards independent countries," and to show an effort to correct the "mistake" of the United States "militarizing its foreign policy towards Asia."
    However, Lippmann believes that currently "we (the United States) are only in the preliminary stage of reassessment forced upon us by the tide of history." He pointed out that Sukarno's speech has dispelled any notion that "everything will be fine with only a slight change in the focus of American foreign aid policy." This is because the "revolutionary movements" in Asia and Africa are aimed at finally eliminating the consequences of three centuries of white rule from Africa, South Asia, and the South Pacific, while overcoming the economic and technological backwardness of the former colonies.
    In an article published on May 17th, Lippmann said that regarding the Soviet disarmament, what is important now is: "whether the Soviets are convincing Western Europe that they know how to point the way to security and prosperity." He said: "The more Mr. Dulles proves that the Soviets have not lost anything by reducing military manpower, the more deeply their example will be rooted in people's hearts. Because Britain, France, and Germany all lack manpower in industry. Military service is considered a waste and a nuisance."
    Lippmann believes that the Soviet Union "is ahead of us (the United States)" in recognizing the political consequences of breaking the American nuclear weapons monopoly. The Soviet Union's respect for the growth of neutrality among countries without nuclear weapons "has greatly increased its political influence in Asia." And in Europe, this "political consequence" has already led the Western countries to recognize at the Geneva Four-Power Summit that "war cannot be considered as an instrument of their policy," this "military stalemate." It is now necessary to adapt Western European military policy to this "military stalemate." It is precisely because of this that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces are "now in trouble, because people are gradually doubting whether it reflects a correct assessment of the future military situation."
    Lippmann said that in this situation, on the issue of reducing military personnel, the door that the Soviets "have pushed is already half open."

### 李普曼说：美国外交政策走在死胡同里  苏联裁军的榜样深入人心

    李普曼说：
    美国外交政策走在死胡同里
    苏联裁军的榜样深入人心
    新华社28日讯　美国著名政论家李普曼五月十七日和二十二日在“华盛顿邮报”接连发表文章，从苏联最近的裁军决定和印度尼西亚总统苏加诺访问美国谈到世界局势的趋向和美国的外交政策。
    李普曼在二十二日的文章里说，在亚洲政策方面，美国“一直在走一条死胡同”。
    李普曼指出，邀请苏加诺访问美国是为了表示“一种对待独立国家的中立主义的新态度”，是为了表示要改正美国“对亚洲的外交政策军事化”的“错误”而作出的一种努力。
    但是，李普曼认为，目前“我们（美国）还只是处在历史的潮流迫使我们作的重新估计的初步阶段”。他指出，苏加诺的演说已经使得认为只要美国的“援外政策重点稍作改变就会万事顺利”的任何概念“烟消云散”。因为亚非国家的“革命运动”是要从非洲、南亚和南太平洋最后消除三个世纪的白人统治的后果，同时克服前殖民地的经济和技术落后。
    在五月十七日发表的文章里，李普曼说，对于苏联的裁军，目前重要的是：苏联人“是否在使西欧相信他们知道如何指明通向安全和繁荣的道路”。他说：“杜勒斯先生越是证明苏联人并没有因裁减军事人力而有所损失，他们所树立的榜样就越发深入人心。因为，英国、法国和德国在工业方面都缺乏人力。服兵役被认为是一种浪费和讨厌的事。”
    李普曼认为，苏联在认识打破美国的核子武器垄断这件事的政治后果方面，“已经跑在我们（美国）前头”。苏联尊重没有核子武器的国家的中立主义的成长，这就“大大增加了它在亚洲的政治影响”。而在欧洲方面，这种“政治后果”已经使得西方国家在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议上承认“不能考虑以战争作为它们政策的工具”的这种“军事僵局”。目前必须使西欧军事政策适应于这种“军事僵局”。正是因为这样，北大西洋集团军队“现在遭到了麻烦，因为人们在逐渐怀疑，究竟它是否反映了对未来军事局势的正确估计”。
    李普曼说，在这种情况下，在裁减军事人员的问题上，苏联人“所推的门已经半开了”。
