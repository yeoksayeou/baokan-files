　　Hurriedly rushing to a small alley near Donghuangchenggen, it was already dark. When I found the house number, rang the bell, I heard a burst of loud laughter, and a tall, robust man was seeing guests out. I thought: This must be Professor Ma Wenzhao.

　　Professor Ma Wenzhao knew I had just come from the film studio's sound stage. He asked me to sit down and, before I could speak, said, "When you make movies, you should have content, a central idea, and use the story in the movie to educate the audience… But what should I talk to you about when you come to interview me?..." He spread his hands. "There's nothing to say, I have nothing."

　　Professor Ma's voice was very hearty, and his face had the sincerity of a child. He said these words obviously without affectation or politeness, which left me speechless for a moment. In fact, my preparation was inadequate. I hadn't read any written materials about Professor Ma Wenzhao, nor had I had time to properly consider how to conduct this conversation. Therefore, I thought that what I should first understand were some aspects of Professor Ma's teaching and research at the school.

　　Professor Ma began by talking about his studies and experiences.

　　Tungchow's Luhe High School was a missionary school. Ma Wenzhao completed Luhe High School and then entered the local Yenching University for eight years -- Tungchow's Yenching University and Beijing's Huiwen merged to become the later Yenching University -- then he went to the Peking Union Medical College for five years. After graduation, he worked as a resident physician at Peking Union Medical College Hospital for one year, then as a physician at Fenyang Hospital in Shanxi for two years, and then as a physician at Luhe Hospital in Tungchow for one year. At that time, there were few hospitals and few doctors. A hospital was often a one-man operation, and all kinds of illnesses had to be treated. It wasn't like the hospitals today, with so many doctors and so many departments.

　　From then on, Mr. Ma turned to the path of teaching and research. He started at the Peking Union Medical College. During the period of enemy occupation, Peking Union Medical College was suspended and transferred to the Peking University Medical School, which is now the Beijing Medical College. Before and after, Mr. Ma has been teaching and researching for nearly forty years.

　　For nearly forty years, what Mr. Ma has taught and researched has always been one subject: histology.

　　Why study histology? Because the human body is made up of tissues. Any part of the body, whether skin, muscles, bones, nerves, blood... is tissue. If we can improve the tissues, strengthen the tissues, it will be very beneficial to human health. With a healthy body, we will have more strength, more resistance, and fewer diseases. In this way, we can do more and better work and make life happier and more fulfilling.

　　It should be said that this is the best wish of any conscientious scientist for humanity. With such a good wish, Professor Ma Wenzhao continued his teaching and research work in "histology" for forty long years. In 1955, Ma Wenzhao published a paper "A Study of the Effect of Phospholipids on Tissues." At the beginning of this paper, he said:

　　"The structural components of various cells in human tissues can basically be divided into two categories: one is the basic structure common to all cells, such as the cell membrane, nucleus, and mitochondria; in general histology textbooks, the Golgi apparatus is also included; however, according to the author's past research, the Golgi apparatus, which contains a large amount of phospholipids, is formed by the combination and decomposition of mitochondria and nucleoplasm excreted by the nucleus; therefore, it cannot be regarded as the basic structure of the cell. The other type of component in cell structure is unique to various cells, such as glycogen, secretory granules, lipid droplets, pigments, etc.

　　According to the views of many chemists and histologists, phospholipids or compounds of phospholipids and proteins exist in the shared structures of all cells.

　　Therefore, the author speculates that if the body is supplied with sufficient phospholipids, it may strengthen the body's assimilation of phospholipids and may thereby enhance the function of cells. And this effect can be seen from changes in the basic structure of cells. Based on this, the author has conducted many years of research on the 'effect of phospholipids on tissues'..."

　　Based on the above reasoning, Ma Wenzhao conducted a long period of research. He found lecithin, also known as egg yolk素, which is one of the main components of the basic structure. He started to experiment with small animals. After the small animals ate lecithin, their basic qualities were significantly enhanced, and their physical strength was also enhanced. He also observed that chronic morphine addicts or opium addicts were full of energy when their addiction was satisfied; when they were suffering from withdrawal, they sneezed, had runny noses and teary eyes, and their bodies were sore and lazy, like a sick man. So he injected small animals with morphine, regularly every day; then he found that if he stopped the injection, the small animals would suffer from addiction, be unable to eat, become listless, and their fur would bristle all over, just like addicts suffering from withdrawal. So he conducted the next step of the experiment, feeding the small animals with morphine addiction lecithin, while still supplying morphine as usual. Six days later, the morphine injection was stopped, and the small animals were still lively, full of energy, and had no symptoms of illness. Two days later, the basic structure of the cells was examined, and the nucleus and mitochondria were all normal.

　　Through such experiments, it was shown that phospholipids have the effect of enhancing the basic structure of cells. Ma Wenzhao then conducted experiments on people with opium addiction, and opium addicts who took lecithin gradually and automatically reduced their smoking, and developed to the point where they would get drunk from smoking a little more, and finally reached the point of complete abstinence from smoking. Opium toxins can destroy hematopoietic tissues, while lecithin enhances basic tissues, thereby restoring hematopoietic tissues; opium addiction gradually decreases, allowing opium addiction to be quit without pain.

　　As early as during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, Ma Wenzhao had achieved the above-mentioned achievements in research. At that time, the Kuomintang government in Nanjing once promoted smoking cessation. After learning about Ma Wenzhao's experimental results, they took him to Nanjing for a summer, and "big officials and wealthy people" often came to visit his experiments. However, the corrupt and昏庸 Kuomintang government did not seriously carry out smoking cessation work. They did not give patients the high-quality lecithin specified by Ma Wenzhao, but only gave patients lecithin used for making soap; as a result, the patients did not experience any effect after taking it, but instead had stomach aches. On the other hand, during the same period, some countries such as India adopted Ma Wenzhao's experimental results to help patients quit smoking, and achieved good results.

　　When Beijing was liberated in 1949, after years of poisoning and destruction by Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, Ma Wenzhao's experimental work had reached a point where it was difficult to continue. Before that, he had been carrying out his work with his own personal strength when the school could not support his experiments; although he had not interrupted his research work in any situation for many years, at this time even life was very difficult. It was also at this time that he heard two different opinions. Some people told him: The Communist Party does not want science, especially hates intellectuals, and his research work will end from now on. But others told him: The Communist Party values science, needs science, and will definitely be able to strongly support his research work that is about to be interrupted. At that time, he did not fully understand the Communist Party. After hearing such different opinions, he was also distressed and excited, and he believed and doubted; with that kind of "let's just say it, let's just listen to it" mood, he wrote a letter to Su Jingguan, the then Minister of Health of the Military Region, explaining his situation and hoping to get support. The letter was sent, but he didn't have any hope. However, unexpectedly, the next day he received a call from Comrade Su Jingguan. The minister said on the phone that it was difficult to raise this funding at the moment, but he was willing to support his work. Two days later, Minister Su called again to invite him to meet and talk. The first sentence when they met, Minister Su said: "I have considered your problem, and I have managed to transfer a sum of money from somewhere else to support your research work." The money was a large amount. And the school also received the care and support of the Ministry of Health for Ma Wenzhao's research work, further expanding his research work.

　　From that time on, Ma Wenzhao continued to study the effects of phospholipids on epidermal tissue, macrophages, and on the treatment of tinea pedis (i.e. athlete's foot), and experiments proved that phospholipids can significantly increase hemoglobin. He has continuously published many papers on the above research, adding valuable wealth to the motherland's medicine.

　　Professor Ma said: "Many diseases are caused by being unhealthy. Like working too hard, staying up too late, thus anemia, and becoming thin and yellow; try taking lecithin, it has an effect. Lecithin can also treat beriberi. There is still no way to cure 'aplastic anemia'. After blood transfusions, it even worsens. Taking lecithin also shows progress."

　　His only thought is to make people healthy and live longer through his experiments on phospholipids. He looked at me with the professional eyes of a doctor and said, "Your body is very good."

　　I told him that I didn't have any other illnesses, just that my stomach wasn't good. At this time, I couldn't help but look at Professor Ma Wenzhao in front of me. His voice was so loud and his spirit was so vigorous. I asked him, "How old are you this year?"

　　He said: "Haha, seventy."

　　I almost jumped up. I have seen comrades in our ranks who are young but "shaped like withered wood". Professor Ma Wenzhao, who is seventy years old, looks like he is in his fifties. His energy, his achievements, his future... this explains many problems.

　　I asked about his situation in educating students and his relationship with students. He said very little. He happily said the names of several of his students, such as Zhong Huilan, Lin Qiaozhi, Zhu Futang, Wu Chao仁... these famous medical experts and scholars are all his students.

　　The conversation with Professor Ma Wenzhao almost ended here, because he said, "There's nothing more to say." As for the relationship with the students, he said, "It's best to ask the students themselves." He didn't think it was credible to visit him as an "advanced producer". He shook his head more than once, saying that he had no achievements and couldn't be called "advanced."

　　According to what the old professor said, on the third night, I went to Professor Ma's laboratory in the anatomy building of the Beijing Medical College at the new campus in the northern suburbs to visit two doctors, both of whom were his students and assistants. When talking about Mr. Ma, the respect and love for their teacher expressed in their words and expressions was moving. Naturally, some of the things they talked about were even more moving.

　　Professor Ma's relationship with his students is as close as family. Although he usually likes to tell jokes and joke around, he is meticulous in class. He has taught "histology" for nearly forty years, but when he gave his last class in 1954, he still started preparing lessons a few days in advance, making outlines, writing lectures, and redrawing diagrams. The students used warm applause to welcome their beloved old professor to leave the classroom. That was because he was too old, and the leaders decided that he would be relieved of his teaching work and focus on research work. But despite this, Professor Ma still enthusiastically helps the students who come to him for advice. Not long ago, he still took two or three hours every day to teach a teacher on vacation in Beijing from another place, his old student.

　　Regarding the Party's proposal to approach the world's advanced scientific level within twelve years, he expressed his opinions with great excitement. Mainly, he believes that the leadership of the medical school has not done enough to give play to the role of scientists. He requires the leadership to think of all ways to make every scientist interested in scientific research, encourage scientific research work, and prepare possible working conditions for scientists. He is full of confidence in the future and believes that if scientists across the country work together, old scientists bring apprentices, and make plans... "It can guarantee victory. Not only can we catch up, but there is also the possibility of exceeding the world's advanced level."

　　He consistently and with a sense of unlimited responsibility gives his opinions to the leaders and the Party. The Party and leaders value such honest and selfless people, so he has always been supported by the Party and leaders.

　　The students especially mentioned the old professor's life and work style. For many years, the old professor has always entered the school in the early morning and returned home in the evening. In order to do experiments every day, he has no Sundays and no holidays; regardless of the heat of summer and the wind and snow of severe winter, he never misses class and is never late. Except for 1955, when he had a severe cold and was hospitalized. Before he was fully recovered, he struggled to go to work, resulting in another illness and return to the hospital. He only left the laboratory for a few days. Otherwise, he was always standing at his post. But the old professor said: "Staying in the hospital is really uncomfortable. As soon as I close my eyes, I go back to the laboratory." These five spacious laboratories are his home.

　　The students boasted about their teacher's health. The teacher often encourages them to exercise. The teacher came from a poor peasant background, and he worked in the fields since he was a child; when the sun was scorching, he even drank horse urine. When he later went to school, he was also an athlete on the football team. When studying in Beijing, he rode his bicycle out of the city every Sunday, went to Fragrant Hills, climbed to the highest peak of Fragrant Hills, "Ghost Sorrow", and then rode his bicycle back home. Naturally, such a poor child has no money to study. His study is done by adopting a "work-study" method.

　　His two students, Doctors Fang Shiyuan and Yang Henry, said: "Our teacher's greatest characteristic is his consistent persistence in work. He works day after day for decades. He does not work for fame or profit, he is hardworking, simple, and honestly researches the subject of 'histology'. He wholeheartedly wants to enhance the people's physique, increase the country's production, and realize a socialist society in the motherland as soon as possible."

　　In this way, it can be understood: Why Professor Ma Wenzhao repeatedly told me that he himself "has nothing to say" and "has no achievements"... It is precisely because science is not a one-day thing, it requires diligence and persistence; it requires diligent labor and meticulous study day after day and year after year. A down-to-earth and unadorned style is the most basic work attitude for scientific research. It may not be like the blooming flowers in spring that dazzle the eyes on the branches, but it is like an evergreen tree that does not wither in the cold of winter and can withstand wind and rain. Forty years of labor, the old professor's disciples are all over the world. His achievements in histology are also flourishing. The people need scientists like Ma Wenzhao. He is a role model for young people. In my opinion, he can still fight for the motherland's medical cause for at least thirty years! I wish him eternal health!

    四十年如一日
    ——访问七十岁的马文昭教授
    吴祖光
    匆匆忙忙赶到东皇城根的一条小胡同里，天已经黑了下来。找到了门牌按铃叫门的时候，听见一阵响亮的笑语声，一个高大矫健的人正送客出来。我想着：这该就是马文昭教授了。
    马文昭教授知道我刚从电影制片厂的摄影棚里赶来，他让我坐下，还没等我开口，就说：“你们拍电影总应该有个内容，有个中心的思想，拍成电影，拿电影里的故事内容来教育观众……可是你现在来访问我，我和你谈什么呢？……”他把一双手摊开来。“没什么可说的呀，我什么也没有。”
    马教授说话的声音非常爽朗，脸上有着像孩子一样的真诚；他说这样的话显然不是矫作和客气，因此反而使我一时答不上话来。事实上我的准备工作很不够，我还没有读到关于马文昭教授的文字材料，也没有时间好好考虑一下如何进行这次的谈话，因此我想到我首先应当了解的还是马教授在学校里的教学和研究的一些情况。
    马教授是先从他的学习和经历谈起的。
    通州的潞河中学是一个教会学校，马文昭读完了潞河中学又升入当地的协和大学读了八年——通州的协和大学和北京的汇文合并成后来的燕京大学——然后他又到北京的协和医学校读了五年。毕业之后在协和医院作了一年住院医师，又到山西汾阳医院作了两年医师，到通州潞河医院作了一年医师。那时的医院很少，医生也少，一个医院里往往就是一个医生的“一人班”，什么病都得管看，不像现在的医院里有这么多的医生，分这么多科。
    从这以后，马先生就转入了教学和研究的道路。开始是在协和医学校，敌伪时期协和停办，转入北大医学院，也就是现在的北京医学院。前前后后，马先生教学研究已经近四十年了。
    近四十年来，马先生所教授的，所研究的始终就是一门学问：组织学。
    为什么要研究组织学呢？因为人的身体是组织成的，身体的任何部分，无论皮肤，肌肉，骨胳，神经，血液……都是组织，如果能够改进组织，增强组织，对于人的健康就会有很大的好处。身体健康了就会增加力气，增加抵抗力，减少疾病。这样就可以把工作做得更多更好，使生活更加幸福，更加美满。
    应该说，这是任何一个有良心的科学家对人类的最好的愿望；凭着这样美好的愿望马文昭教授进行他的“组织学”的教学和研究工作继续了四十年悠长的时间。1955年马文昭发表了一篇论文“磷脂类对于组织作用的研究”。在这篇论文的开始，他说：
    “人体组织中各种细胞的构造成分基本上都可以分为两类：一类是一切细胞所共有的基本结构，如细胞膜、细胞核和线粒体；在一般组织学教科书中，高基氏器也包括在内；但作者根据过去的研究，认为含有大量磷脂类的高基氏器是由线粒与由核排泄出来的核质化合之后分解所形成的；因之，他不能作为细胞的基本结构看待。细胞结构中另一类成分是各种细胞所特有的，如肝糖、分泌颗粒、脂滴、色素等。
    依据许多化学家和组织学家的见解，磷脂类或磷脂与蛋白质的化合物存在于一切细胞的共有结构中。
    因此，作者推测：如果供给机体充分的磷脂类，可能加强机体对磷脂的同化作用而且可能由之而增强细胞的机能。而这方面的影响，是可以从细胞基本结构的变化上看出来的。据此，作者进行了多年的‘磷脂类对组织作用’的研究。……”
    马文昭根据上面的推理，进行了长时期的研究。他找到了卵磷脂，也就是蛋黄素，是基本结构里的主要成分之一。他开始用小动物来做实验，小动物吃过卵磷脂之后，基本素质有显著的增强，体力随之而增强。他又观察到慢性吗啡中毒者或者鸦片嗜好者在满足了烟瘾时精力饱满；在犯瘾的时候，又打喷嚏，又流鼻涕眼泪，浑身酸懒，形如病夫。于是他给小动物注射吗啡，每天按时注射；随后他就发现假如停止注射，小动物犯起瘾来，吃不下东西，萎靡不振，浑身的毛都乍起来，和吸毒的人犯瘾的时候一样。于是他进行了下一步的实验，给有吗啡瘾的小动物喂以卵磷脂，同时还是照常供给吗啡。六天以后停止吗啡的注射，小动物依旧活泼，精力饱满，没有任何病症。过两天检查细胞里的基本结构，细胞核和线粒等一切正常。
    通过这样的实验，说明磷脂类具有使细胞基本结构增强的作用。马文昭接着在有鸦片烟瘾的人身上进行试验，服用卵磷脂的烟瘾患者逐渐地自动减少了吸烟，而且发展到吸食稍多便会醉倒，最后达到了完全戒绝吸烟的程度。烟毒能破坏造血的组织，而卵磷脂使基本组织增强，从而恢复造血组织；烟瘾便逐渐减少，使烟瘾无痛苦地戒掉。
    远在国民党反动派统治时期，马文昭便在研究工作中得到了上述的成就。当时国民党的南京政府曾经一度宣传戒烟，知道了马文昭的试验成绩便把他接到南京去住了一个夏天，而且经常有“大官阔人”来参观他的试验。但是腐朽昏庸的国民党政府并不认真地进行戒烟的工作。他们并不按照马文昭指定的品质优良的卵磷脂给病人服用，而只是用造胰子用的卵磷脂给病人吃；结果病人吃下去没有丝毫效验，反而肚子疼。倒是在同一时期印度等一些国家采用了马文昭的试验成果给病人戒烟，收到了良好的效果。
    1949年北京解放的时候，经过日本帝国主义和国民党反动派多年的荼毒摧残，马文昭的试验工作已经到了难以继续下去的境地。在这以前，他在学校不能支持他的试验的情况之下是用自己个人的力量来进行工作的；尽管多少年来在任何情况下都没有中断了他的研究工作，但是这时候却是连生活也是非常困难的了。也就是在这个时候他听到了两种不同的说法，有人对他说：共产党是不要科学的，尤其仇恨知识分子，他的研究工作将从此结束了。但是又有人对他说：共产党重视科学，需要科学，一定能够大力支持他行将中断的研究工作。而那时他对共产党是完全不了解的。听了这样不同的说法，也苦恼，也兴奋，将信将疑；就带着那种“姑妄言之，姑妄听之”的心情，他给当时的军区卫生部长苏井观同志写了一封信，说明自己的情况，希望得到支持。信是发出了，却并没有存什么希望，然而出乎意外地在第二天他便接到了苏井观同志的电话。苏部长在电话里说目前很难筹出这笔经费，但是愿意支持他的工作。过了两天苏部长又打电话来约他面谈。见面时的第一句话，苏部长说：“我考虑了你的问题，我已经设法从别处挪了一笔款子来支持你的研究工作。”款子是一笔很大的数目。并且学校也得到了卫生部的关照支持马文昭的研究工作，更扩大了他的研究工作。
    从那时起，马文昭继续研究了磷脂类对于表皮组织、巨噬细胞以及对于治疗脚癣（即脚气）的作用，并且经过试验证明磷脂类能使血色素显著增加。他不断地发表了很多关于上项研究的论文，为祖国的医学增加了很有价值的财富。
    马教授说：“有许多疾病都是由于不健康而得。像工作太累，熬夜过度，因此贫血，黄瘦；试服卵磷脂，有效果。卵磷脂又能治脚气病。‘再生不良贫血病’至今没有方法治，经过输血，反更恶化，服用卵磷脂亦有进步。”
    他唯一的想法，就是通过他对磷脂类的试验使人健康，长寿。他望着我，带着那种职业性的医生的眼光，说：“你的身体很不错。”
    我告诉他，我没有别的病，只是胃不好了。这时我不由得看到面前的马文昭教授，他的声音这样响亮，精神这样旺盛，我就问他：“您今年高寿？”
    他说：“哈哈，七十。”
    我简直要跳起来了，我是见过我们队伍里面年纪轻轻然而“形如槁木”的同志的。七十岁的马文昭教授望之如五十许人。他的精力，他的成就，他的未来……这说明了很多的问题。
    我问到他的教育学生的情况，和学生的关系，他说得很少。他很高兴地说了几个他的学生的名字，像锺惠澜、林巧稚、诸福棠，吴朝仁……这些著名的医学专家和学者都是他的学生。
    和马文昭教授的谈话几乎就截止在这里了，因为他说：“没什么可说的了。”至于和学生的关系，他说：“最好是问问学生本人。”对于以访问一个“先进生产者”来访问他，他觉得不大可信。他不止一次地摇头，说自己没有什么成绩，谈不上什么“先进”。
    按照老教授所说的，我在第三天的晚上到北京医学院在北郊的新校址的解剖大楼里马教授的实验室去访问了两位医生，都是他的学生和助手。谈到马先生，他们从语言和神情上表现出来的对他们的老师的尊敬和喜爱是令人感动的，自然他们谈到的一些事情是更令人感动的。
    马教授和学生的关系亲如家人，平时尽管爱说笑话，开玩笑，但是上课时是一丝不苟的。“组织学”这门功课，他教了近四十年，然而在1954年他讲最后的一堂课时，仍然是在前几天便开始备课，作提纲，写讲稿，并且重新画图；同学们用热烈的掌声来欢送他们热爱的老教授离开教室。那是由于他的年纪太大了，领导决定他解除了教学工作，专做研究工作。但是尽管如此，马教授仍旧热情地帮助经常前来请教的学生们，就在不久以前他还每天抽出两三个小时的时间给一个外地来北京休假的教师，他的老学生上课。
    关于党提出的要在十二年内接近世界先进的科学水平，他以极度兴奋的心情发表他的意见。主要的他认为医学院的领导在发挥科学家的作用方面还做得很不够。他要求领导要想一切办法使每一个科学家都有兴趣去搞科学研究工作，鼓励科学研究工作，给科学家准备可能的工作条件。他对前途充满信心，相信全国科学家一同努力，老科学家带徒弟，订计划……“就能保证胜利。不仅能赶上去，而且有超过世界先进水平的可能。”
    对领导，对党，他一贯地负有无限的责任感地随时提出他的意见。党和领导重视这样正直无私的人，因此他也始终是受到党和领导的支持的。
    学生们特别提到老教授的生活和工作作风。多少年来老教授永远是清晨入校，到晚上才回家。为了每天要作试验，他没有星期日，没有假期；无论暑天的炎热和严冬的风雪，他从不脱班，从不误点。除去1955年因为生了一场重感冒住医院，病没全好就挣扎上班，结果再度病倒回院，只有这几天离开了实验室，此外就没有一天不是站在他的工作岗位上的。但是老教授说：“住在医院里真是别得难受，一闭上眼睛就回到实验室里了。”这五大间宽阔的实验室就是他的家。
    学生们夸耀着老师的身体。老师经常鼓励他们锻炼身体。老师是贫雇农出身，自幼劳动，下庄稼地；赤日当头的时候，连马尿都喝过。等到后来上了学，又是足球队的运动员。在北京读书的时候，每个星期天都骑车出城，到香山，爬上香山的最高峰“鬼见愁”，然后再骑车进城回家。自然，这样的穷孩子是没钱读书的，他的学习是采用“半工半读”的办法。
    他的两个学生，房世源和杨亨利大夫说：“我们的老师的最大的特点就是他的一贯性的坚持工作。数十年如一日地工作。不为名，不为利，艰苦，朴实，老老实实地研究‘组织学’这一门学问。一心一意要增强人民的体质，增加国家的生产，使社会主义社会早日在祖国实现。”
    这样就能理解：为什么马文昭教授屡次对我说他自己“没有什么可说的”，“没有什么成就”……正是因为科学不是一天的事情，需要勤恳，需要坚持；需要天复一天，年复一年的辛勤劳动和细致地钻研。脚踏实地，朴素无华的作风就是科学研究的最基本的工作态度。它不一定像春日的繁花在烂熳枝头炫人眼目，但是它像岁寒不雕的常青树一样禁得起风吹雨打。四十年的劳动，老教授的门墙桃李遍天下。他在组织学上的成就也还正是方兴未艾。人民需要像马文昭这样的科学家，他是年轻人的榜样。照我看来他至少还能为祖国的医学事业健斗三十年！祝他永远健康！
