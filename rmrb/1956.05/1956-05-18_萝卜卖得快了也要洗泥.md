    Even If Radishes Sell Quickly, They Still Need to Be Washed
    Kong Sang
    On May 9th, at a small symposium in Beijing on the quality of industrial products, a comrade from the Taiyuan Municipal Industrial Bureau raised a question: "Can the quality requirements for products that are currently selling out be relaxed somewhat?" He advocated relaxing them somewhat. In fact, some industrial enterprise workers have been doing this for a long time: when sales are poor, they pay attention to improving product quality, but when products sell well, they start producing shoddy goods. Some commercial workers also agree with this view: when the sales of a certain product are poor, the inspection is stricter when purchasing; when a certain product is selling out, the inspection is looser, and may even be skipped altogether. As a result, many unqualified products flow into the market.
    The main reason for advocating relaxing the quality requirements for products that are selling out is to rapidly meet the needs of improving people's lives and developing production. For example, some people say, "Even products of poor quality cannot meet the needs, so why bother improving product quality? Wouldn't this create an artificial market panic?" Some people say, "Everyone is so hungry they can't afford to be picky about food, and so cold they can't afford to be picky about clothes. Therefore, we must first meet the needs in terms of quantity before we can talk about guaranteeing and improving quality, otherwise, we will be divorced from the masses!"
    At first glance, these reasons seem plausible, but upon closer examination, it becomes clear that they are completely wrong. Consumers have diverse requirements; for products of the same variety and specification, some want better ones, while others want worse ones. Various industrial products are divided into first-class, second-class, third-class, etc. If more people need first-class products, then produce more first-class products; if more people need second-class or third-class products, then produce more second-class or third-class products. Regardless of which class of product is produced, regardless of whether the market is selling out or sluggish, it must be guaranteed to meet the quality standards stipulated by the state (or specified in the contract when the commercial department places an order). Here, product quality and quantity are consistent; if the quality does not meet the standard and the product cannot meet the needs, then even if the quantity is large, it cannot meet the needs. Let's take a simple example. The cost of each pair of Wuhe brand rubber shoes produced by Qingdao State-owned No. 9 Rubber Factory is about 2.2 yuan; the cost of each pair of Feipeng brand rubber shoes produced by Qingdao Joint State-Private Fuxingxiang Rubber Factory is also about 2.2 yuan. Feipeng brand rubber shoes have a good style and are durable; Wuhe brand rubber shoes have a bad style and are not durable. Some of them break after only being worn for 360 li. Therefore, as many Feipeng brand rubber shoes as are produced are sold out; but Wuhe brand rubber shoes, even the factory workers themselves are unwilling to buy them. In the context of a rubber shoe sell-out in Shandong Province, more than one million pairs were still stockpiled last year.
    There is a saying in our country: "When radishes sell quickly, don't wash off the mud." Although it is not good to not wash the mud off the radishes, it does not have a big impact, as long as the consumer washes the mud off, they can eat them. Industrial products are different. If a thermos bottle does not keep warm, the consumer cannot make it keep warm; if a piece of printed cloth fades, the consumer cannot make it not fade; if a pair of leather shoes is not durable, the consumer cannot make it durable… Therefore, if popular industrial products do not guarantee quality, they will be stockpiled. The earliest Xuehua flannel produced by Shanghai State-owned No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory was very popular among the masses. Some printing and dyeing factories in Tianjin, Qingdao and other places saw that sales were very good, so they imitated it in a shoddy manner. The snowflakes printed became goose feathers, a vast expanse of white. As a result, it was not liked by the masses. The sold-out Xuehua flannel was turned into stockpiled Xuehua flannel because the quality requirements were relaxed. There are many examples like this. Therefore, for industrial products, we must never "not wash the mud off the radishes when they sell quickly," but rather "wash the mud off the radishes even when they sell quickly."

    萝卜卖得快了也要洗泥
    孔桑
    五月九日，在北京召开的一个关于工业产品质量问题的小型座谈会上，太原市工业局的一位同志提出一个问题：“对目前脱销的产品的质量要求，可不可以放宽一些？”他是主张放宽一些的。现在，有一些工业企业的工作人员，实际上早就这样做了：销路不好的时候，就注意提高产品质量，产品一畅销，就粗制滥造起来。有些商业工作人员也同意这个意见：哪一种产品的销路不好，进货时检验就严一些；哪一种产品脱销，检验就松一些，甚至可以不检验，结果，很多不合格品就流到市场里来。
    主张对脱销产品的质量要求放宽一些的主要理由，就是迅速满足人民生活改善和生产发展的需要。例如有的人说：“连质量次的都不能满足需要，干嘛还要提高产品质量？这岂不是造成人为的市场恐慌吗？”有的人说：“凡人都是饥不择食，冻不择衣的，所以，必须首先在数量上满足需要以后，才谈得到保证和提高质量，否则，就会脱离群众！”
    乍听起来，这些理由似乎都是振振有词，其实，只要稍加推敲，就会明白是十分错误的。消费者的要求是多种多样的，对同样品种规格的产品，有的要好一点的，有的则要次一点的。各种工业品就有一级品、二级品、三级品……之分。需要一级品的人多，就多生产一级品；需要二级品或三级品的人多，就多生产二级品或三级品。不论生产哪一级产品，不论市场上是脱销还是滞销，都必须保证达到国家规定的（或商业部门订货时合同规定的）质量标准。在这里，产品质量和数量是一致的，质量不够标准，不能满足需要的产品，即使数量很多，也不能满足需要。让我们随便举一个例子吧。青岛国营第九橡胶厂生产的五和牌胶鞋，每双成本是二元二角左右；青岛公私合营复兴祥橡胶厂生产的飞鹏牌胶鞋，每双成本也是二元二角左右。飞鹏牌胶鞋的式样好，又耐穿；五和牌胶鞋的式样不好，又不耐穿，有些只穿走三百六十里路就破了。所以，飞鹏牌胶鞋有多少就销多少；而五和牌胶鞋呢，连自己厂的工人都不愿买，在山东省胶鞋脱销的情况下，去年还积压一百多万双。
    我国有句俗话：“萝卜卖得快了不洗泥。”萝卜不洗泥，虽然不好，但是影响不大，只要消费者把泥洗掉了，就可以吃。工业品则不一样。一个热水瓶不保暖，消费者是不能使它保暖的；一匹花布掉色，消费者也不能使它不掉色；一双皮鞋不耐穿，消费者也不能使它变成耐穿的……所以，畅销的工业品如果不保证质量，就会积压。上海国营第一印染厂最早生产的雪花呢很为群众喜爱，天津、青岛等地的一些印染厂看见销路很好，就粗制滥造地仿制起来，印出来的雪花变成了鹅毛大雪，白茫茫的一大片，结果就不为群众所喜爱了。脱销的雪花呢因放宽质量要求而变成了积压的雪花呢。像这样的例子多得很。因此，对于工业产品来说，绝不能“萝卜卖得快了不洗泥，”而是“萝卜卖得快了也要洗泥。”
