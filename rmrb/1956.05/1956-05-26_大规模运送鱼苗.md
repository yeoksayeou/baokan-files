A large-scale transportation of fish fry

At 10:00 a.m. on May 21st, a special train departed from Hankou Station, carrying 60 million fish fry to Harbin, a city more than 2,600 kilometers away. One hundred staff members and technicians, along with twenty students interning from higher aquatic schools, accompanied the train to take care of the fish fry. This was a batch of fish fry ordered from the middle reaches of the Yangtze River by the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Commerce's Aquatic Products Bureau to meet the needs of expanding fish farming this year. Such a large-scale, long-distance transportation of fish fry is the first in China's history.

When the train arrived at Fengtai Station in the Beijing urban area at 2:00 p.m. on May 23rd, Soviet ichthyology professor Koren, who was in Beijing, Bai Shuang, head of the Department of Aquaculture at the Korean Agricultural University, Tran Ngoc Thien, head of the Fisheries Department of the Central Rural Work Committee of Vietnam, and Soviet aquaculture expert Zhubkov from the Ministry of Commerce, accompanied by Kang Runmin, Deputy Director of the Aquatic Products Management Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce, went to visit. The accompanying staff and intern students introduced the transportation situation along the way to the fisheries experts from various countries and listened to the experts' opinions on improving the work.

The train transporting the fish fry consisted of seventeen carriages. The fish fry were placed in mobile canvas fish baskets in the carriages. The train was equipped with rain sprinklers and artificial aeration equipment. It also provided the fish fry with egg yolk feed in moderation along the way and paid attention to adjusting the water temperature. Therefore, the survival rate of the fish fry was very high. According to the inspection when the train arrived at Fengtai Station, the survival rate of the fish fry was over 95%, and the survival rate of fish fry in individual carriages reached 98%.

    大规模运送鱼苗
    五月二十一日上午十时，从汉口站开出了一列专用火车，载着六千万尾鱼苗，运往远距二千六百多公里的哈尔滨市。一百名工作人员和技术人员以及二十名高等水产学校实习的学生，随车担任护理鱼苗的工作。这是黑龙江商业厅水产局为适应今年扩大养鱼的需要，向长江中游一带订购的鱼苗。这样巨大规模的长距离运输鱼苗，在我国历史上还是第一次。
    当这列火车在二十三日下午二时抵达北京市区丰台站的时候，正在北京的苏联鱼类学教授科仁、朝鲜农业大学水产学部部长白爽、越南中央农村工作委员会渔业司长陈玉善和商业部的苏联水产专家朱布可夫等，由商业部水产管理总局康润民副局长陪同前往参观。随车的工作人员和实习学生向各国渔业专家介绍了沿途运送情况，并且听取了专家们改进工作的意见。
    这列运送鱼苗的火车共有十七个车厢，鱼苗装在车厢的活动帆布鱼篓中，列车上装有淋雨器和人工送气设备，沿途还适量供给鱼苗以蛋黄饲料，并且注意调节水温，因此鱼苗成活率很高。根据列车开抵丰台站时候的检查，鱼苗成活率达95％以上，个别车厢的鱼苗成活率达98％。（附图片）
