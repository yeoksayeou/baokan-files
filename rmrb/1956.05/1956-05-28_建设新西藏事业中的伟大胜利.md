    Great Victory in the Cause of Building a New Tibet
    Banchan Erdini Qoigyi Gyaincain
    Today, the trial flight of the Beijing-Lhasa air route was successful. Airplanes from the motherland can now land and take off on the Tibetan Plateau. This is a great victory in breaking the world's aviation history, another new achievement in our country's socialist construction and the cause of building a new Tibet, and something that the people of our country and the people of Tibet can be proud of!
    The reactionaries and ambitious figures in history once slandered Tibet's vast sky as a "restricted area" for aviation and slandered Tibet's beautiful mountains and rivers as "poor mountains and evil waters." However, today, in the era of the people being masters of their own affairs, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we have not only built ground roads, but also opened up air routes connecting Tibet to the capital Beijing and other parts of the motherland, further shortening the connection between Tibet and other parts of the country.
    This victory is the result of the wisdom and hard work of comrades engaged in aviation work under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. Here, I would like to express my condolences and pay my highest respects to the comrades who participated in the trial flight!
    This victory took place in the most beautiful season in Tibet - May, when the sun is bright, flowers and trees are flourishing, and everything is thriving. In this month, we cheered for many victories, such as: the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, children from all over the region joined the Young Pioneers of China, and young people joined the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and so on. All these victories eloquently demonstrate that the work in Tibet has actually entered a new stage. These victories encourage the Tibetan people to have more courage and confidence to move forward along the socialist road, along the road of "unity, progress and greater development". It is foreseeable that there will be more exciting things in the future, and the Tibetan people will be full of confidence to move from victory to victory! (Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 26th)

    建设新西藏事业中的伟大胜利
    班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞
    今天，北京—拉萨航线试航成功了，祖国的飞机可以在西藏高原上降落起飞，这是打破世界航空历史的伟大胜利，是我国社会主义建设事业和建设新西藏事业中的又一新成就，是我国人民、西藏人民可以引为骄傲的事情！
    历史上的反动派和野心家们，曾把西藏辽阔的天空污蔑为航空界的“禁区”，污蔑西藏美丽的山川为“穷山恶水”。但是，在今天，在人民当家作主的时代，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，我们不但修通了地面上的公路，同时也打通了西藏通向祖国首都北京以及通向祖国其他各地的空中道路，更加缩短了西藏同祖国各地的联系。
    这一胜利，是从事航空工作的同志们在党和毛主席的领导下，付出智慧、辛勤劳动的结果。这里，我谨向参加试航工作的同志们，表示慰问，并致以崇高的敬礼！
    这一胜利，是发生在西藏最美丽的季节——日光明媚、花木并茂、欣欣向荣的五月。在这个月里，我们欢呼了许多胜利，如：西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，各地少年儿童们参加了中国少年先锋队，青年们参加了中国新民主主义青年团等等。所有这些胜利，都雄辩地说明了西藏的工作实际进入了一个新的阶段。这些胜利鼓舞着西藏人民更加有勇气、有信心沿着社会主义道路，沿着“团结、进步和更加发展”的道路前进。可以预料，今后令人兴奋的事情更多，西藏人民将充满信心从胜利走向胜利！　（新华社拉萨26日电）
