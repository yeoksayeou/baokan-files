Jiangxi Province is planting dryland rice and deep-water rice this spring on more than 40,000 mu of dry land with insufficient water sources and lake fields along the river and lake areas. This type of dryland rice is very drought-resistant, and can yield at least 250 jin per mu in dry land with insufficient water; deep-water rice can grow in paddy fields with a water depth of eight chi, and can produce at least 200 jin per mu.

After this batch of rice is harvested, it will be kept as seeds in preparation for large-scale planting next year in areas where rice could not be grown in the past. (Xiong Longru)

    江西试种陆稻和深水稻
    江西省今春在四万多亩水源不足的旱田和沿江滨湖一带的湖田里种植陆稻和深水稻。这种陆稻耐旱性很强，在水源不足的旱田内每亩至少可收二百五十斤；深水稻能在水深八尺的水田内生长，每亩至少可产二百斤以上。
    这批稻谷收获后将留作种子，准备明年在过去不能种植水稻的地区大规模地播种。　（熊龙如）
