    波兰扩大同亚非国家的贸易
    新华社华沙5日电　波兰同亚非国家的贸易日益开展。越来越多的波兰各个工业部门在为亚非国家制造着各种工业设备和交通工具。
    五月四日列宁冶金联合企业运出了大批钢铁材料到各个机械厂去为缅甸制造特种米仓。好几个机械工厂正在为埃及制造十八个巨大的油槽。弗罗茨瓦夫有名的火车车厢制造厂正在为印度赶制二千六百辆各种货车。这个工厂的职工们在制造这批货车中，提出了许多合理化建议，使每辆货车的制造时间缩短了八十小时，他们保证提前把订货运到印度去。
    参加卡萨布兰卡国际博览会的波兰代表团已经同若干亚非国家签订了贸易协定，根据这些协定，波兰将向摩洛哥和其他国家输出价值二十万美元以上的工业设备和其它货物。
