Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 24th—The Baoji-Chengdu Railway will soon have its north and south sections joined. The vanguard of the southern section's track-laying reached Baishui River, known as the "throat between Qin and Shu," on the 23rd, only twenty-six kilometers from the joining point. The northern section has already crossed Shuangshipu and is moving south along the Jialing River; another thirty-two kilometers of track-laying will reach the joining point.

Inspired by the new national record created by workers in the northern section, bridge-building workers in the southern section, while erecting a sixteen-meter T-beam for the Telugou Middle Bridge on the 16th, used only one hour and eight minutes (fifty minutes less than the northern section), creating a new national record.

Currently, all staff and workers are striving to remove all obstacles to track-laying.

Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 24th—The "Sino-Soviet Friendship Memorial Bridge" on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway was completed today. This bridge was named by railway construction workers to commemorate the great help provided by Soviet experts in the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway project.

The bridge construction project was undertaken by the youth shock brigade led by advanced producer Li Weibi. They launched a socialist emulation campaign with day and night double shifts during construction and promoted the advanced experience of the "prefabricated assembly method of bridge pier models." Therefore, since the start of construction on the anniversary of the sixth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the bridge project was completed in just over three months.

The "Sino-Soviet Friendship Memorial Bridge" is built on the Hongshui River in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province. All the materials used for the bridge were saved by the staff and workers for the country during past railway construction projects.

    宝成路南北两段即将接轨
    兰新路上的“中苏友好纪念桥”落成
    新华社成都24日电　宝成铁路很快就要南北接轨。南段铺轨前锋在二十三日已经到达号称“秦蜀襟带”的白水江，距离接轨点只有二十六公里；北段已经越过双石铺，沿嘉陵江南下，再铺三十二公里也可以到达接轨点。
    在北段工人创造全国新纪录的鼓舞下，南段架桥工人十六日在架设铁炉沟中桥的一孔十六公尺的丁字梁的时候，只用了一小时零八分钟（比北段又减少了五十分钟），创造了全国新纪录。
    现在，全线职工正在为清除一切铺轨障碍而努力。
    新华社兰州24日电　兰新铁路上的“中苏友好纪念桥”在今天落成。这座大桥是筑路职工为了纪念苏联专家对兰新铁路工程的巨大帮助而命名的。
    担任大桥修筑工程的是先进生产者李维璧所领导的青年突击队。他们在施工中开展了日夜双班的社会主义竞赛，并且推广了“桥墩模型成品拼装法”的先进经验，因此从中苏友好同盟互助条约签订六周年纪念日那天开工以来，只经过了三个多月时间，就完成了大桥工程。
    “中苏友好纪念桥”修筑在甘肃省河西走廊的洪水河上。大桥所用的全部材料，都是职工们在过去筑路工程中为国家节省下来的。
