    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 14th: According to TASS, the French Socialist Party delegation, led by General Secretary Guy Mollet, has concluded its visit to the Soviet Union and left Moscow on May 14th to return home.

    During its stay in Moscow, the delegation held talks with a Soviet Communist Party Central Committee delegation composed of Khrushchev, Mikoyan, Suslov, Shepilov, and others. On May 12th, members of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and secretaries of the Central Secretariat held a final conversation with the French Socialist Party delegation.

    According to the joint communiqué issued on May 14th by the Soviet Communist Party and the French Socialist Party, the talks were conducted in a friendly and completely frank atmosphere. The talks expressed the hope that, in assessing the situations in both countries and in discussing the differing ideological positions of the two parties, each party should pay the utmost attention to objectivity and avoid unjust attacks on each other, as such attacks would be detrimental to the necessary mutual understanding.

    The Soviet Communist Party delegation and the French Socialist Party delegation agreed to propose to their respective Central Committees the issue of continued contact between the two parties in the future, that is, to exchange views on those issues raised in the negotiations that concern the vital interests of the working classes and peoples of France and the Soviet Union. These interests primarily relate to easing international tensions and consolidating the cause of peace.

    The Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party expressed its willingness to receive fifty to sixty French Socialist Party workers in the Soviet Union this summer to spend their vacations with Soviet laborers and learn about the life of the Soviet people.

    The French Socialist Party delegation spent fifteen days visiting the Soviet Union. In addition to participating in the May Day celebrations in Moscow, the delegates spent a lot of time learning about various aspects of life in Moscow and also visited Leningrad, Kiev, Tbilisi, and other places. They were warmly and comradely welcomed by the Soviet working people everywhere they went.

    The itinerary for the delegation's visit and tour in the Soviet Union was drawn up according to the delegation's wishes. In the symposiums held in many departments of the Soviet government, trade unions, and party organizations and city soviets in various parts of the Soviet Union, as well as in individual conversations with Soviet laborers, the delegation members received interesting news, and the questions they raised were answered. They also learned about many religious ceremonies and visited labor reform camps and prisons.

    苏联共产党和法国社会党会谈结束
    发表联合公报表示两党愿意继续增进接触
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：由法国社会党总书记比·戈曼率领的法国社会党代表团已经结束了在苏联的访问，在五月十四日离开莫斯科回国。
    代表团在莫斯科期间，曾经同由赫鲁晓夫、米高扬、苏斯洛夫、谢皮洛夫等人组成的苏共中央代表团举行了会谈。五月十二日，苏共中央主席团的委员们和中央书记处的书记们同法国社会党代表团举行了最后一次谈话。
    据苏联共产党和法国社会党在十四日发表的联合公报说，谈话是在友好和完全开诚布公的气氛中进行的。谈话中表示希望，在估计两国情况和在讨论两党的不同的思想立场的时候，每一个党都要极其注意客观态度，避免相互进行不公正的攻击，因为这种攻击会给必要的相互谅解带来损失。
    苏联共产党代表团和法国社会党代表团同意向自己的党中央委员会提出关于今后两党继续接触的问题，就是说就那些在谈判中涉及的并且有关法苏两国工人阶级和人民的切身利益的问题交换意见。这些利益首先关系到缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平事业。
    苏共中央表示愿意在今年夏天，接待五十到六十名法国社会党工人到苏联来同苏联劳动者共同休假和了解苏联人民的生活。
    法国社会党代表团在苏联进行了十五天的访问。代表们除在莫斯科参加了“五一”节庆祝会以外，用很多时间来了解莫斯科的各方面的生活，还到列宁格勒，基辅、第比利斯等地参观访问。他们在各地受到苏联劳动人民热情的同志般的欢迎。
    代表团在苏联访问和参观的日程是按照代表团的愿望制定的。在苏联政府的许多部门、工会和苏联各地的党组织和市苏维埃举行的座谈中，以及同苏联劳动者的个别谈话中，代表团人员都得到了有趣的新闻，他们所提出的问题都得到了回答。他们还了解了许多宗教仪式的情况，参观了劳动改造营和监狱。
