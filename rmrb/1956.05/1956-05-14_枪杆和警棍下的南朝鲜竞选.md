Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 12th: Seoul dispatch: The quadrennial South Korean presidential election is about to be held on May 15th. The election campaign is being conducted under the control of Syngman Rhee's military police.

Syngman Rhee is once again the presidential candidate of the Liberal Party. In his campaign, apart from repeating his warmongering calls for expanding the army, preparing for a "northern advance," abolishing the armistice agreement, and disbanding the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, he has not put forward any specific solutions to the various problems related to the immediate interests of the South Korean people. As in the previous two presidential elections, Syngman Rhee is single-mindedly planning to continue relying on guns and batons to seize the presidential seat.

Since the announcement of the election date, acts of violence by military police and secret agents interfering in the election campaign have been constantly occurring. Opposition party offices in various places have been attacked, campaign workers have been beaten and arrested, and some candidates' election registration documents have also been stolen. Shin Ik-hee, the presidential candidate of the Democratic Party, died suddenly on May 5th. Cho Bong-am, the Progressive Party candidate who is left to compete with Syngman Rhee for the presidency, is facing the terror of mass arrests following the May 5th Seoul demonstration and has gone into hiding. He says that an extreme right-wing veterans group wants to assassinate him. Park Gi-chul, the Progressive Party's vice-presidential candidate, also withdrew from the election.

On the eve of the election, anti-Syngman Rhee sentiment is growing. "Kyonghyang Shinmun," in commenting on the anti-Rhee demonstration in Seoul, said that the anti-Rhee demonstration was "a true manifestation of the will of those who are eagerly hoping for a swift change of government." In order to cater to popular sentiment, the Democratic Party put forward the slogan "We cannot continue to live like this, now is the time for change." Cho Bong-am of the Progressive Party put forward his proposal to unify Korea through peaceful means. The Democratic Party and the Progressive Party also launched limited attacks on Syngman Rhee's dictatorship and war policy.

### 枪杆和警棍下的南朝鲜竞选

    枪杆和警棍下的南朝鲜竞选
    新华社平壤12日电　汉城消息：四年一度的南朝鲜总统选举就要在五月十五日举行。竞选活动正在李承晚军警控制之下进行。
    李承晚再次充当自由党的总统候选人。他在竞选中除了重复扩充军队、准备“北进”以及废除停战协定和取消中立国监察委员会的好战叫嚣以外，没有提出解决有关南朝鲜人民切身利益的各项问题的任何具体办法。像在前两次总统选举中一样，李承晚一心打算继续依靠枪杆和警棍夺取总统位子。
    自从选举日期公布以来，就不断发生军警和特务干涉竞选活动的暴行。反对党在各地的办公处遭到袭击，竞选工作人员遭到殴打和逮捕，有的候选人的选举登记文件也被抢走。民主党的总统候选人申翼熙已经在五月五日突然死亡。剩下来和李承晚竞选总统的进步党候选人曹奉岩，面临着五月五日汉城大示威以后的大逮捕的恐怖，已经躲藏起来。他说，有一个极端右翼的退伍军人团体要暗杀他。进步党的副总统候选人朴己出也随即退出竞选。
    在选举前夕，反对李承晚的情绪日益增长。“京乡新闻”在评论汉城的反李大示威时说，反李示威是“那些非常盼望迅速改变政府的统治的人们的意志的真正表现”。为了迎合人心，民主党提出了“我们不能继续这样活下去，现在是改变的时候了。”的口号。进步党的曹奉岩提出了他的通过和平方法统一朝鲜的主张。民主党和进步党并且对李承晚的独裁和战争政策进行了有限度的攻击。
