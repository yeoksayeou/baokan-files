    To His Excellency Gamal Abdel Nasser, Premier of the Republic of Egypt:
    I am pleased to receive the notification from Mr. Midhat El-Far, Commercial Representative of the Republic of Egypt, regarding the decision made by your cabinet meeting on May 16, 1956, to formally withdraw recognition of the government of Taiwan, while recognizing the People's Republic of China, and expressing the willingness to establish diplomatic relations and exchange diplomatic envoys. On behalf of the government of the People's Republic of China, I would like to express a warm welcome to this friendly step taken by your government and hope that our common desire to formally establish diplomatic relations and exchange diplomatic envoys between our two countries can be realized soon.
    Since the Asian-African Conference, the friendship between the people of our two countries has achieved new development. Our two governments have already concluded friendly cooperative agreements in the fields of culture and trade. I firmly believe that the further development of the friendly relations between our two countries will be more conducive to promoting friendly cooperation between Asian and African countries and safeguarding the common cause of world peace.
    Please accept, Your Excellency, my highest regards.
