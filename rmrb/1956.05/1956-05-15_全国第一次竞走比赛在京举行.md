    The First National Race Walking Competition Held in Beijing
    131 athletes from thirty-five cities participated in the race walking competition of the "1956 National Cross-Country Running and Race Walking Championship" in Beijing on the morning of the 14th. This is the first time our country has held this sporting event.
    The athletes participating in the race walking competition briskly walked westward from Tiananmen Square, circled the Forbidden City, and then returned to Tiananmen Square before turning towards Qianmen Street, reaching the Xian Nong Tan Stadium at the finish line. They walked ten thousand meters.
    Race walking is about twice as fast as ordinary walking. When race walking, both feet cannot leave the ground at the same time; when the front foot lands, the leg must be straight. If this rule is violated, the referee will issue a warning for the first offense, and the athlete will be disqualified for further offenses. Tang Zhaoquan, a student from the Xi'an Institute of Physical Education secondary school, won the race walking competition with a time of 52 minutes and 52.4 seconds. He only started practicing race walking this year. In reality, he was the sixth to reach the finish line that day, but the first five were disqualified for violating the rules of race walking.
    Yang Shengxiu, another student from the Xi'an Institute of Physical Education, won second place. Liu Yuchang, a junior high school graduate from Jinan No. 2 Middle School, won third place.

    全国第一次竞走比赛在京举行
    来自三十五个城市的131名运动员，十四日上午在北京参加了“1956年全国越野跑、竞走冠军赛”中的竞走比赛。这是我国第一次举办的运动项目。
    参加竞走比赛的运动员从天安门广场向西疾行，绕故宫一周，再回到天安门折向前门大街，到达终点先农坛体育场，他们走了一万公尺。
    竞走比普通走路的速度约快一倍多。竞走时，两脚不能同时离开地面；前脚跟着地时，这个腿必须伸直。如果违反了这个规则，第一次裁判员予以警告，再犯就取消比赛资格。西安体育学院中等专科学生唐兆铨以52分52秒4的成绩获得了这次竞走比赛的冠军。他是今年才开始练习竞走的。这天他实际是第六名到达终点，前五名因为违反了竞走的规则被取消了资格。
    西安体育学院的另一学生杨省修获得第二名。获得第三名的是济南市二中初中毕业学生刘旴昶。
