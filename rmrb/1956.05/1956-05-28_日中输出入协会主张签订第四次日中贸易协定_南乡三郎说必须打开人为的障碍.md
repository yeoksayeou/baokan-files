    Xinhua News Agency, 26th, Tokyo Dispatch: The Japan-China Import and Export Association held its first member conference in Tokyo on the 26th, and decided on its business plan for 1956. This plan includes: promoting the signing of the fourth Japan-China trade agreement and inviting representatives of Chinese commercial organizations to visit Japan, etc.
    Saburo Nango, the chairman of the association who had just returned from a visit to China, gave a report at the conference. Nango said that during his visit to China, he saw that China's politics and economy were developing rapidly, and he was particularly impressed by the progress and development of heavy industry and agriculture.
    He said that he felt that trade between Japan and China could be greatly expanded. He said that trade organization representatives from Western European countries such as Britain, France, and Italy are already active in Beijing. If Japan remains hesitant and does not actively seek solutions, it may miss a good opportunity for trade with China.
    He pointed out that expanding Japan-China trade must first remove artificial obstacles to trade, and send strong representatives to be stationed in China, and at the same time, strive to make the Japanese commodity exhibition held in China this autumn a success.

    日中输出入协会主张签订第四次日中贸易协定
    南乡三郎说必须打开人为的障碍
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：日中输出入协会二十六日在东京举行第一届会员大会，决定了1956年度的事业计划。这个计划包括：促进签订第四次日中贸易协定和邀请中国商务机关代表访问日本等。
    刚从中国访问回国的协会理事长南乡三郎在大会上作了报告。南乡说，他这一次访问中国看到中国的政治、经济都很发展，尤其是重工业和农业的进步发展给他一个深刻的印象。
    他说，他感到日本同中国的贸易是可以大大地扩展的。他说，北京已经有英国、法国、意大利等西欧国家的贸易机构代表在活动。如果日本还犹疑不决，不去积极谋求办法，恐怕将会失去同中国贸易的好机会。
    他指出，扩展日中贸易首先必须打开贸易上的人为障碍，并且派遣强有力的代表常驻中国，同时要努力使今年秋季在中国举办的日本商品展览会成功。
