    Strengthen Leadership and Organization of Second-hand Booksellers
    Improve the Acquisition and Supply of Classical Books
    Editor's Note: The letter from reader Li Guangyu raises a question that deserves attention. According to our understanding, the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Culture has begun to pay attention to this issue and is preparing to directly lead the second-hand book industry. However, the phenomenon of neglecting the second-hand book industry exists not only in Tianjin but also in many other places. In order to collect and preserve valuable ancient books and old books, the second-hand book industry should be well organized to give full play to their strength. The practice of neglecting the second-hand book industry should be quickly corrected. Some of the suggestions put forward in Li Guangyu's letter can be used as a reference for improving work in various places.
    To the Editor:
    I am a second-hand bookseller in Tianjin. I want to reflect a common opinion of the second-hand booksellers in Tianjin: the cultural authorities in Tianjin have not provided good leadership and organization for us second-hand booksellers, in order to strive for the preservation of classical books and the communication of various books and periodicals, which has resulted in some losses.
    After liberation, there were a total of 46 second-hand bookstores in Tianjin, and now there are only more than 20 left, most of which are concentrated in the Tianxiang Market, mostly stall vendors. We purchase goods from the homes of book collectors and the Xiaoshi Market, and sell them to school libraries and colleagues in Beijing. Since liberation, due to our dispersed manpower (generally one person per stall) and lack of funds, we have not done a good job in supply, resulting in the loss of many valuable ancient books. For example, in 1953, there was a "Palace Edition of the Complete Collection of Illustrations and Writings of Ancient China" (殿版图书集成) (there are only a few copies of this book in the country, and each copy was worth 10,000 silver dollars 30 years ago). Because we could not afford it, the book owner sold it as waste paper. Later, relevant central authorities found out and sent people to recover it, but only a small part was recovered. Also, because we cannot afford to store good books, schools and institutions in Tianjin often have to go to Beijing to buy the books they need, which is very inconvenient.
    However, the cultural leadership organs in Tianjin did not pay attention to this issue. In the socialist transformation work, we were led by the Xinhua Bookstore. The leaders believed that the second-hand book industry had no future and was not an object of development, so they mobilized some of our merchants to clear out old books and switch to selling new books; they also mobilized another part of the people to return to their hometowns to engage in production. When we raised objections, we were refuted. As a result, some old gentlemen with 30 or 40 years of business experience were about to be mobilized to return to their hometowns. Ruiji, Fuxing and other larger second-hand bookstores sold most of their books by the catty because they had to clear out their inventory in a very short period of time. Some of the remaining households, because they had not had time to arrange them one by one, were approved to jointly operate with the cultural goods company, under the leadership of the Tianxiang Market Main Store. The two in the Quanye Field were even classified into the department store system and led by the department store company.
    After the joint operation, due to the lack of understanding of our business and operating characteristics by the main store, there were many problems in the leadership work. For example, the main store mechanically required us to abide by "labor discipline" that was not suitable for our work situation, which inevitably affected our work of going out to buy goods and contacting various institutions. We have to get up at four o'clock in the morning to buy second-hand books at the morning market, but after returning, we still have to go to work on time (the time uniformly stipulated by the main store) and participate in the scheduled study and meetings, so sometimes we only have four hours of sleep a day. The money needed to buy old books requires a lot of procedures to be received, and it must be returned within a limited time. In addition, the main store also restricts us from going to other places to purchase goods. The reason is said to be that from the perspective of the "cultural goods company," our industry is not an object of development.
    Our lives have not been taken care of as they should be. Although the mess hall has been set up, we cannot participate. Our salaries are fixed, but it is difficult to get help when we encounter special difficulties. These also inevitably affect our work mood.
    However, we love our work. Because we know that the Party and the government attach great importance to our country's cultural heritage, and doing a good job in the acquisition and supply of old books is a matter of great significance. In addition, some of us have 30 or 40 years of business experience, and most of us have contact with the libraries and reference rooms of various institutions, so it is possible to do a good job. When we buy some rare and uncommon books (such as three copies of the Yongle Encyclopedia) through our hands, we feel very excited; when we see a reader buy an old book that he urgently needs but cannot find everywhere, we are also happy. What we feel painful is that some leading organs do not pay attention to our work, so that many valuable ancient books and many old books with reference value have been treated as waste paper to wrap peanuts or even make paper pulp! However, we can't do anything even if we are sad, because there are only 20 or 30 people in Tianjin who run second-hand bookstores, and this little bit of manpower that has been preserved by luck cannot be fully utilized because it has not received due support and reasonable use.
    In order to improve future work, I suggest: first of all, the Municipal Bureau of Culture should directly lead the second-hand book industry, and reasonably organize it according to the existing types, so as to give play to the business expertise of each employee, keep abreast of market conditions and the needs of all parties. Secondly, increase the funds for the second-hand book industry and expand the scope of acquisition, so as to avoid the loss of valuable books due to lack of acquisition. In the acquisition work, it is necessary to correct the view of simply focusing on profitability. Some books are unpopular, and it is not easy to sell them at the time, but it is even more difficult to find them when they are needed, so someone should also acquire and preserve them. Finally, improve the personnel system, and under the principle of distribution according to work, ensure that the lives of each employee are reasonably taken care of; stipulate reasonable working hours so that employees can carry out cultural, political studies and spare-time activities; in particular, do a good job in exchanging experiences and use various methods to improve the business level of employees, because if we don't pay attention to cultivating successors, no one will understand old books in the future!

    加强对旧书商贩的领导和组织
    做好古典书籍的收购和供应工作
    编者按：读者李光育的来信，提出了一个值得重视的问题。据我们了解，天津市文化局已经开始注意这个问题，准备把旧书业直接领导起来。但是，不重视旧书业的现象，不但在天津市一地存在，在其他不少地方也有。为了搜集和保存宝贵的古籍旧书，应该对旧书业加以很好的组织，以充分发挥他们的力量。不重视旧书业的做法，都应该迅速纠正。李光育来信中提出的一些建议，可供各地改进工作的参考。
    编辑同志：
    我是一个天津市的旧书商贩。我要向你们反映天津市旧书商贩的一个共同意见：天津市的文化机关没有很好地领导和组织我们旧书商贩，来为保存古典书籍和沟通各类书刊而努力，以致造成了一些损失。
    解放后天津旧书业共四十六户，现在只剩二十多户，大部分都集中在天祥市场，其中以摊贩居多。我们从藏书主家中和晓市进货，销售对象是各学校图书馆和北京同业。解放以来，由于我们人力分散（一般是一摊一人），资金缺少，因此并没有作好供应工作，以致有许多珍贵古籍遭受了损失。例如，在1953年有一部“殿版图书集成”（这书全国只有有数的几部，在三十年前每部就值现洋一万元），因为我们买不起，书主就把它当废纸卖了。后来中央有关机关知道了，四出派人回收，结果只追回一小部分。又如，因为我们存不起好书，天津的学校和机关经常要到北京去买他们需要的书，就感到很不方便。
    但是，天津市文化领导机关并没有重视这个问题。在社会主义改造工作中，我们是由新华书店领导的。领导方面认为旧书业是没有前途的，不是发展对象，就动员我们一部分商户清理旧书，改营新书；还动员另一部分人还乡生产。我们提出意见，反而受到了驳斥。于是，有些有三、四十年业务经验的老先生都要被动员回乡。瑞记、复兴等较大的旧书业户因为要在很短时期内清理存书，就把大部分书籍按斤出卖了。剩下的一些户因为没有来得及逐一安排，就被批准同文化用品公司合营，由天祥市场总店领导。而劝业场的两家竟被划为百货系统，由百货公司领导了。
    合营以后，由于总店对我们的业务和经营特点不了解，在领导工作中有着不少问题。例如，总店机械地要我们遵守不适合我们工作情况的“劳动纪律”，就不能不影响我们出外买货和同各机关联系的工作。我们上早市收购旧书要在四点钟起床，但是回来以后仍要准“时”（总店统一规定的时间）上下班，还要参加规定的学习和会议，因此有时我们一天只有四小时的睡眠时间。收买旧书所需用的钱，要费很多手续才能领下，并且要限期归还。此外，总店还限制我们到外地去购货，理由据说是因为从“文化用品公司”的角度来看，我们这个行业不是发展对象。
    我们的生活也没有得到应有的照顾。虽然伙食团已经办起来了，但是我们不能参加。我们的薪金固定下来了，但是遇有特殊困难的时候却很难得到帮助。这些也不能不影响我们的工作情绪。
    但是，我们对自己的工作是热爱的。因为我们知道，党和政府对我们国家的文化遗产是十分重视的，做好旧书的收购和供应工作是一件意义重大的事情。另外，我们之中有的人已经有三、四十年的业务经验，大部分人都和各机关的图书馆和资料室有联系，做好工作是有可能的。当我们经手买到一些珍贵罕见的图书（如曾收购到三本永乐大典）的时候，我们就感到十分兴奋；当我们看到一个读者买到一本他迫切需要而到处买不到的旧书以后的欣悦表情，心里也随着高兴。我们感到痛心的是，有一些领导机关对我们的工作不加重视，以致有不少宝贵的古书和很多有参考价值的旧书，已经被当成废纸去包花生米甚至造纸浆了！但是，我们再痛心也没有办法，因为全天津市经营旧书的只有二、三十个人了，而这一点侥幸保留下来的人力，也因为没有得到应有的支持和合理的使用而不能充分发挥作用。
    为了改进今后的工作，我建议：首先市文化局要把旧书业直接领导起来，按现有类型合理加以组织，以发挥每个从业人员的经营特长，随时掌握市场情况和各方面需要。其次，要增加旧书业资金，扩大收购范围，以免珍贵书籍无人收购而受到损失。在收购工作中必须纠正单纯从盈利着眼的看法，有些书是冷门货，当时不好卖，但是需要时要找也就更不好找，所以也应该有人收购保存。最后，要健全人事制度，在按劳取酬的原则下使每个从业人员的生活得到合理的照顾；要规定合理的作息时间，使从业人员能够进行文化、政治学习和业余活动；特别要做好交流经验的工作，用各种方法提高从业人员的业务水平，因为如果再不注意培养后进，将来会没有人懂旧书了！　李光育
