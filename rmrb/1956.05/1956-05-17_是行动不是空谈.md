After the conclusion of the United Nations Disarmament Committee Subcommittee meeting in London, Western countries, in order to shirk responsibility, desperately promoted the idea that the meeting was fruitless because the Soviet Union was unwilling to solve the disarmament issue. This distorted propaganda has now received a powerful response: the Soviet government has decided to reduce its armed forces by 1.2 million men, disband 63 divisions and independent brigades, and decommission 375 naval vessels before May of next year. The Soviet government also stated: "If the Western countries such as the United States, Britain, and France correspondingly reduce their armed forces and armaments, the Soviet government is prepared to study the question of further reductions in the Soviet armed forces." Obviously, no one will believe that a country unwilling to solve the disarmament problem would take such practical measures for disarmament. The Soviet Union's actions show that it is truly a consistent advocate of disarmament.

This is not the first time the Soviet Union has reduced its armed forces. Last year, the Soviet Union reduced its army by 640,000 troops. Unfortunately, the Soviet Union's actions did not receive a response from Western countries. Western countries continued their arms race and used new tricks to obstruct the reaching of a disarmament agreement. The recently concluded London Disarmament Conference ended without achieving anything because Western countries insisted on a position that was more backward than before and adopted a capricious attitude. However, this situation has not prevented the Soviet Union from contributing to the cause of disarmament by taking advantage of every opportunity. The Soviet Union's decision to automatically reduce a huge number of armed forces this time is precisely to promote the further relaxation of international tensions and the strengthening of mutual trust between countries, thereby creating more favorable conditions for the realization of universal disarmament.

Western countries always use the lack of necessary international trust as a reason for refusing disarmament, but they are unwilling to do anything that truly helps to build this trust. In contrast to the contradictory position of Western countries, the Soviet Union does not deny that trust between countries is closely related to the issue of disarmament, but it advocates that all countries should take joint action to build international trust, rather than waiting for this trust to fall from the sky. This gives rise to two completely different attitudes: one is to make the disarmament issue remain in useless empty talk forever, and the other is to continuously promote the realization of disarmament with concrete actions. Western countries recently abandoned their original proposed levels of armed forces, citing the current situation has not yet eased, and insisted on maintaining a large army. The Soviet Union, however, decided to substantially reduce its own armed forces based on the current international situation. What a stark contrast.

The Soviet Union's disarmament decision is based on the correct position that the Soviet Union believes that war is not destined to be inevitable, and that there are now powerful social and political forces that have the practical and reliable strength to prevent aggressive blocs from launching wars. It is now entirely possible to stop the arms race and use useful manpower and material resources for peaceful construction that creates happiness for the people. The Soviet Union's re-reduction of armed forces is a convincing proof of the Soviet Union's firm adherence to a policy of peace. It severely hit the conspiracies of those who still want to use the "Soviet aggression threat" to justify military blocs and the policy of arms expansion and war preparation.

The Soviet Union's actions have been warmly welcomed and praised by public opinion in various countries, which is only natural. British officials also admitted that this was "a step in the right direction." But one cannot help but notice that those who claim to be willing to disarm are trying their best to belittle the significance of the Soviet Union's noble action of reducing its armed forces. They insist that the Soviet Union decided to reduce conventional armaments because "conventional weapons and armies are becoming obsolete in modern warfare." However, everyone knows that the United States has always boasted of its superiority in nuclear armaments, but it refuses to agree to reduce these "obsolete" conventional armaments. People judge a country's sincerity for peace based on actions, not words. Any distortion of the Soviet Union's disarmament actions by Western countries cannot conceal their own position of refusing to disarm. Western news agencies have revealed that Western officials are deeply afraid that the Soviet Union's disarmament actions will "put Western countries in the difficult position of having to reduce armaments under the pressure of world public opinion." They are right to be afraid. The Soviet Union's disarmament decision will undoubtedly greatly strengthen the determination of people of all countries to strive for disarmament. People fully support the challenge put forward in the Soviet government's statement on May 14: If Western countries really hope to promote the consolidation of the cause of peace, they cannot but follow the example of the Soviet Union.

    是行动不是空谈
    联合国裁军委员会小组委员会在伦敦举行的会议结束之后，西方国家为了推卸责任，拚命宣传说会议所以毫无结果是因为苏联不愿意解决裁军问题。这种歪曲宣传现在得到了有力的回答：苏联政府决定在明年五月以前裁减武装部队一百二十万人，解散六十三个师和独立旅，把三百七十五艘军舰停止使用。苏联政府并且表示：——“如果美国、英国、法国这些西方国家相应地裁减它们的武装力量和军备，苏联政府准备研究关于进一步裁减苏联武装部队的问题”。很显然，没有人会相信，一个不愿意解决裁军问题的国家会采取这种裁军的实际措施的。苏联的行动表明，它真正是言行一致的裁军拥护者。
    苏联裁减自己的武装部队，这回并不是第一次。苏联在去年就曾经裁减了六十四万军队。可惜苏联的行动并没有得到西方国家的响应。西方国家还是照样搞它们的军备竞赛，同时用新的花样来阻挠裁军协议的达成。刚刚结束的伦敦裁军会议，就是因为西方国家坚持比过去倒退的立场和采取反复无常的态度，而终于一事无成。但是这种情况并没有能阻止苏联利用一切机会对裁军事业作出贡献。苏联这一次决定自动裁减巨大数目的武装部队，正是为了促进国际紧张局势的进一步缓和以及国与国之间相互信任的加强，从而为普遍裁军的实现创造更有利的条件。
    西方国家总是拿缺乏必要的国际信任作为拒绝裁军的理由，但是他们却不肯做一些真正有助于建立这种信任的事情。同西方国家的这种自相矛盾的立场相反，苏联并不否认国与国之间的信任和裁军问题密切相关，然而它主张各国应当为建立国际信任而采取共同行动，而不是坐待这种信任从天而降。这样就出现了两种完全不同的态度：一种是想使裁军问题永远停留于无益的空谈，另一种是不断以具体的行动来促成裁军的实现。西方国家最近还借口目前的局势尚未缓和而放弃了它们原来提出的武装部队水平，坚持要保持庞大的军队。而苏联却根据目前的国际形势决定大量裁减自己的武装部队。这是何等强烈的对照。
    苏联的裁军决定是从这样的正确立场出发的：苏联认为现在战争不是注定不可避免的，现在存在着强大的社会和政治力量，他们拥有切实可靠的力量足以制止侵略集团发动战争。现在完全有可能停止军备竞赛，把有用的人力物力用于为人民创造幸福的和平建设事业。苏联再一次裁减武装部队的行动，正是苏联坚定地奉行和平政策的令人信服的明证。它严重地打击了那些到现在还想利用“苏联侵略威胁”谰言来为军事集团和扩军备战政策辩护的人们的阴谋。
    苏联的行动受到了各国舆论热烈欢迎和赞扬，这是理所当然的。英国的官员也承认，这是“朝着正确方向的一个步骤”。但是人们不能不注意到，那些口口声声说自己愿意裁军的人，正在竭力想贬低苏联裁减武装部队的高尚行动的意义。他们硬说，苏联决定裁减常规军备是因为“常规武器和军队正在现代化的战争中变得陈旧了”。但是，大家知道，美国一直是在吹嘘它在核子军备方面拥有优势的，但是它却不肯同意裁减这种“陈旧的”常规军备。人们是根据行动而不是根据言词来判断一个国家对和平的诚意的。西方国家对苏联裁军行动的任何曲解，都不能掩饰它们自己不肯裁军的立场。西方通讯社曾经透露说，西方国家的官员深怕苏联的裁军行动会“使西方国家处于在世界舆论的压力下不得不同样裁减军备的为难境地”。他们是怕对了。苏联的裁军决定，毫无疑问将大大加强各国人民争取裁军的决心。人们完全支持苏联政府五月十四日声明中所提出的挑战：西方国家如果真是希望促进和平事业的巩固，就不能不效法苏联的榜样。
