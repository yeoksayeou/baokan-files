Preparing Gifts for Children for the Holiday
　　Ge Xian

　　The "June 1st" Children's Day is approaching, and the first children's goods store newly opened in the capital this year has prepared many holiday gifts for the children.

　　Interesting puppet show toys such as "The Fox Catches the Rooster," "Little Masha," and "Two Clumsy Bears" have already been displayed in the glass windows. These puppet show toys can be used for performances and have a storyline, making them very popular with children. These puppet toys are new products from the Beijing Children's Toy Factory and have only recently begun official production. However, as many as are made, that many are sold, and the supply falls short of demand. The store just received over two hundred sets of puppet toys from the factory, and they were sold out in less than a week. Many nurseries and kindergartens often call the store to ask for goods. The comrades in the store keep calling the factory to urge them to deliver the goods. The factory cannot supply them in time, saying that the bear's head is not ready or that Little Masha's clothes have not been put on yet. Now, they can only ship as many sets as they can produce. Director Hao of the Children's Toy Factory promised: In the near future, they will rush to make four hundred sets of puppet show toys to meet the needs of the "June 1st" holiday. If that's not enough, they will increase production again by the end of the month!

　　For Children's Day, mothers always want to buy some small gifts for their beloved children, right? Or, they want to buy some gifts for the children in nurseries. Now, this children's goods store has prepared 20,000 gift bags for mothers and has started selling them from May 25th. The gift bags are divided into four types: toys, clothing, stationery, and candy. The bags contain toys such as chemical wobblers, chemical flower balls, small grass baskets, tangrams, plasticine, and pull-string Mickey Mouse. In addition, there are various children's stationery items, small towels, small scarves, candies, etc. Children will definitely love this gift.

　　Many new styles of children's clothing prepared by the children's goods store for "June 1st" have also been successively displayed. They started selecting colors and styles as early as mid-April, busily preparing holiday clothing for the children. Now, 30,000 pieces of children's clothing have been prepared. In the past few days, the number of dresses and shirts sold each day has more than doubled compared to usual.

　　In addition, floral fabric umbrellas, small sandals made of small checkered poplin material, printed small bed sheets, large cloth dolls, etc., are also new products prepared for "June 1st." Balloons, plasticine, and various small toys will also be supplied in large quantities during the holiday.

    给孩子们准备过节的礼物
    葛娴
    “六一”儿童节就要来到了，首都今年新开的第一个儿童用品商店已经为孩子们准备好了许多节日的礼物。
    有趣的木偶戏玩具“狐狸捉公鸡”、“小玛沙”和“两只笨熊”，已经在玻璃橱窗里陈列出来了。这种木偶戏玩具能够供演出，有故事性，孩子们都非常喜爱这新玩艺儿。这种木偶玩具是北京市儿童玩具厂的新产品。最近才开始正式生产。可是做出多少，就卖出多少，供不应求。这个商店刚从厂里运来的二百多套木偶玩具，不到一个星期就卖光了。许多托儿所和幼儿园还常打电话来向商店要货，商店里的同志们又连连打电话催厂里交货，厂里来不及供应，不是说熊的头还没做好，就是小玛沙的衣服还没给穿上呢，现在只好能出多少套就运多少套来。儿童玩具厂的郝厂长答应：在最近，一定要赶制好四百套木偶戏玩具供应“六一”节日的需要，不够，到月底再增产！
    过儿童节，妈妈们总想要买些小礼物给自己心爱的孩子吧！或者，要想买些礼品送给托儿所里的孩子们。现在，这个儿童用品商店已经为妈妈们准备了二万份礼品袋，从五月二十五日起就开始出售了。礼品袋分玩具、服饰、文具和糖果四种。袋里分别装着化学摇人、化学花球、小草提篮、七巧板、橡皮泥和拉线米老鼠等玩具，另外，还有各种儿童用的文具，小毛巾、小纱巾和糖果等等，孩子们一定很喜爱这份礼品的。
    儿童用品商店为了“六一”而准备的许多新式样的儿童服装也陆续陈列出来了。它们早在四月中旬就开始选花色，选式样，忙着为孩子们准备过节的服装。现在，已经准备好了三万件儿童服装。最近几天，每天卖出的裙衣、衬衣比平常增加了一倍以上。
    此外，花布油伞、用小格子府绸料做的小凉鞋、印花小床单、大型布娃娃等，这些也都是为“六一”而准备的新商品。还有汽球、橡皮泥和各种小玩具在节日也都大量供应。
