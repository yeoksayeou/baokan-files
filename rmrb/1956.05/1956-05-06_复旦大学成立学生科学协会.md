    Fudan University Establishes Student Science Association
    Fudan University established a Student Science Association on the 4th, admitting approximately 27% of the students as its first batch of members.
    To date, nearly a hundred science groups have been established at Fudan University. Senior students, organized into science groups under the guidance of teachers, have conducted over eighty scientific research projects. The electronics science group is working on designing and trial-assembling an analog circuit for an electronic computer capable of solving certain differential equations. The optics science group is studying the photographic plate's sensitivity curve and resolution. The inorganic fertilizer science group of the chemistry department is researching the types and manufacturing methods of inorganic fertilizers, as well as the state of China's fertilizer industry. The vacuum tube science group is studying the application of vacuum tubes in chemistry and basic techniques. The Michurin science group has planted tomatoes for grafting and hybridization experiments; the vertebrate science group is conducting a survey and research on "the activities and hazards of wild rats near Jiangwan" in coordination with the "eliminate the four pests" campaign. Some science groups in botany are studying problems closely related to production practices, such as "the decline in tobacco leaf quality after flowering," "eggplant flower drop," and "potato storage."

    复旦大学成立学生科学协会
    复旦大学四日成立了学生科学协会，吸收占27％左右的学生为第一批会员。
    到目前为止，复旦大学已经成立了近百个科学小组。高年级学生组织的科学小组在教师指导下，进行了八十多项科学研究。电子学科学小组正在着手设计和试装一架能解某种微分方程式电子计算机的摹拟电路。光学科学小组研究照相板的感光曲线和分辨率。化学系无机肥料科学小组正在研究无机肥料的种类、制法和中国肥料工业的情况。电子管科学小组正在学习有关电子管在化学上的应用和基本技术。米丘林科学小组已经种了番茄，以便进行番茄的嫁接和杂交的试验；脊椎动物科学小组配合除“四害”的活动，进行“江湾附近野鼠活动及危害情况”的调查研究。植物学方面的一些科学小组研究“烟草叶子在开花后质量降低”、“茄子落花”、“马铃薯的储藏”等密切结合生产实践的问题。
