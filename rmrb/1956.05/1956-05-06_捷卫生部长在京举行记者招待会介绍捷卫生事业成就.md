Xinhua News Agency, 4th: Dr. Plojhar, head of the Czechoslovakian Ministry of Health delegation visiting China and Minister of Health, held a press conference in Beijing this afternoon to introduce the achievements of Czechoslovakian health services.

Plojhar said that 90% of the people in Czechoslovakia now enjoy free medical care. Working people who go to hot springs and sanatoriums for treatment can also enjoy free treatment. In the past, medicines relied on imports. Now, the country's established pharmaceutical industry can completely achieve self-sufficiency in medicines and can also export them. In terms of preventing and controlling epidemics and infectious diseases, there have been particularly significant achievements in the prevention and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. Patients suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis and other diseases enjoy 100% free medical care. According to 1955 statistics, the infant mortality rate under one year of age was only 33 per thousand, which is considered low in the world. In 1937, during the bourgeois rule, the infant mortality rate was as high as 137 per thousand. There are specialized medical systems for school-age children and workers. Small towns with more than 4,000 people now have relatively well-equipped hospitals; rural areas generally have local medical institutions and maternity hospitals with 20 to 30 beds. Czechoslovakia now has eight medical colleges and eighty intermediate medical schools. The number of doctors has greatly increased compared to the past. Now, there is an average of one doctor for every 718 people in the country, in addition to more than 65,000 nurses. Great importance is also attached to medical scientific research. There are now a total of 26 medical scientific research institutions of various disciplines in Czechoslovakia.

Plojhar said that in their short few days in China, they have already seen the tremendous achievements of New China's health services. During their visit to Beijing, they have already established friendship with Chinese health workers. He said that Czechoslovakian health workers hope to cooperate more closely with Chinese health workers, helping each other and learning from each other.

　　捷卫生部长在京举行记者招待会介绍捷卫生事业成就
    新华社4日讯　捷克斯洛伐克卫生部访华代表团团长、卫生部长普洛伊哈博士今天下午在北京举行记者招待会，介绍捷卫生事业的成就。
    普洛伊哈说，现在捷克斯洛伐克90％的人民都能享受到免费医疗。到温泉和疗养院去疗养的劳动人民也都可以享受免费。过去药品都依赖进口，现在国家建立的医药工业完全可以使药品自给自足，而且可以外销。在防治流行病和传染病方面，对肺结核病的防治工作特别有成就。得肺结核等病的病人百分之百的享受免费医疗。据1955年统计，一岁以内的婴孩死亡率只有千分之三十三，这在世界上是算低的。而在1937年资产阶级统治的时代，婴孩死亡率高达千分之一百三十七。对学龄儿童和工人都有专门的医疗制度。在超过四千人以上的小城镇，现在都设有较完善的医院；农村中普遍设有地段医疗机构和二、三十个床位的产院。现在捷克斯洛伐克有八个医学院和八十个中级医科学校。医生比过去大大增多，现在全国平均718个人中有一个医生，此外还有六万五千多个护士。对医学科学研究也很重视，现在捷克斯洛伐克全国共有二十六个各科医学科学研究机构。
    普洛伊哈说，他们在中国短短的几天中，已经看到了新中国卫生事业的巨大成就。在北京访问期间，他们已经和中国卫生工作者建立了友谊。他说，捷克斯洛伐克卫生工作者希望同中国卫生工作者更亲密地合作，互相帮助，互相学习。
