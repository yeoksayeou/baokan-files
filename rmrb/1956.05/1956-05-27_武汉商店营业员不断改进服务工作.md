Wuhan Shop Sales Clerks Continuously Improve Service Work
Zhang Wei

One evening, the Jianghan Silk and Cloth Company received a call from a construction site requesting enough linen canvas to cover 300 square meters of flooring. If it couldn't be delivered to the site before 8 a.m. the next morning, the project would have to be halted. At the time, the store was out of stock, and the warehouse staff had already gone off duty. They contacted the Municipal Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company to find a way to get the goods out of the warehouse early the next morning and deliver them to the construction site, preventing any interruption to the project. The workers were extremely grateful. They also took samples to factories and construction sites to understand the workers' needs and deliver goods to them. When they took samples to the Fifth Power Plant, the chairman of the plant's trade union immediately found them a place to display the goods and used workers' rest time to broadcast four announcements to the workers. The workers immediately bought more than 130 yuan worth of cloth and suggested that they deliver goods when the factory paid wages each month. In this way, the Jianghan Silk and Cloth Company changed its business style of waiting for customers to come to the door.

Since February of this year, the commercial departments in Wuhan City have launched a labor competition centered on improving service quality, and examples like the Jianghan Silk and Cloth Company are constantly emerging.

In the competition, the joint state-private Yongtai Cloth Shop invited more than 100 resident representatives to hold discussions three times. Based on the opinions of the masses, they improved the display of goods and added nearly a thousand varieties of colors and patterns.

Many employees of joint state-private shops have conscientiously established and implemented service covenants. The employees of the Binshengyuan Department Store established a service covenant of "take more, ask more, and introduce more." One day, a customer named Geng Youtang wanted to buy a red woolen sweater, but the store only had blue ones. The salesperson, Shen Yongli, took the initiative to recommend that he buy wool and asked a cooperative to knit it for him, which would be more suitable than buying a ready-made one. Geng Youtang immediately introduced some comrades to the store, and they bought nearly 100 yuan worth of goods.

The employees also created some new service methods in the competition. For example, the Jianghan Silk and Cloth Company and the Yongtai Cloth Shop signed a contract with a sewing production cooperative to handle processing on their behalf and set up clothing processing departments in the stores, which reduced the inconvenience of customers having to run back and forth, and was very popular with customers.

    武汉商店营业员不断改进服务工作
    张碨
    一天晚上，江汉绸布公司接到一个工地的电话，他们要够铺三百平方公尺地板用的亚麻帆布，假使第二天早上八时前不能送到工地，工地便要停工。当时，店里没有货了，而仓库工作人员已经下了班。他们便同市花纱布公司联系，设法在第二天一早从仓库里把货取出来送到工地，使工程没有间断。工人们非常感激。他们又带样品到工厂、工地去了解工人的需要，为工人送货。他们带样品到了第五发电厂的时候，厂里的工会主席马上为他们找了摆货的地方，还利用职工休息时间，向工人作了四次广播，工人们当时便买了一百三十多元的布，还建议他们在每月工厂发工资的时候送货来。就这样，江汉绸布公司改变了等客上门的经营作风。
    从今年二月起，武汉市商业部门展开了以提高服务质量为中心的劳动竞赛，像江汉绸布公司的事例，正在不断出现。
    在竞赛中，公私合营永泰布店先后三次邀请了附近的一百多名居民代表座谈。他们根据群众意见，改进了货柜的摆设，增加了近千种花色品种。
    许多合营商店的职工，都认真地建立和执行了服务公约。斌胜源百货商店的职工订立了“多拿、多问、多介绍”的服务公约。一天，一位名叫耿友堂的顾客想买一件红色的绒线衣，而店里只有蓝色的。营业员沈永立便主动介绍他买绒线，并且找合作社替他编织，比买现成的还合穿。耿友堂马上介绍一些同志来这个商店买了将近一百元的东西。
    职工们在竞赛中还创造了一些新的服务方法。如江汉绸布公司和永泰布店同缝纫生产合作社签订了代办加工合同，在店里附设服装加工处，减少了顾客往返跑路的麻烦，很受顾客欢迎。
