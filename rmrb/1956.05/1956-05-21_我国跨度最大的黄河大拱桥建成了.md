    China's Largest-Span Yellow River Arch Bridge Completed
    Yàn Shùguì
    East of Lanzhou, in the Shili Mountain gorge through which the Yellow River flows, a new three-arch reinforced concrete bridge, more than 200 meters long, has been completed. Two tall piers, supporting the massive bridge body, stand proudly in the turbulent rapids of the Yellow River. Three elliptical arches with a span of 53 meters each, like rainbows, outline the bridge openings with extraordinary beauty. The reinforced concrete columns between the bridge deck and the arches form an openwork structure, allowing people to see the scenery on the opposite side. This bridge is not only practical and beautiful, but also, because it is entirely made of reinforced concrete, it saves the country 300 tons of steel compared to a purely steel bridge. While ordinary iron bridges can be used for 70 to 80 years, this one can be used for 200 to 300 years, and future maintenance costs will also be lower.
    Building the Yellow River Arch Bridge was a very complex and arduous project. In particular, building such a large arch bridge with a span of 53 meters for each arch is unprecedented in the history of bridge construction in China. The entire project was carried out in the treacherous rapids of the Yellow River and at a height of 30 to 40 meters in the air, with difficult construction conditions and complex technical requirements.
    The railway workers who built this bridge fought against floods, and sometimes against ice floes and severe cold, day and night in the Yellow River rapids. The year before last, in the dead of winter, preparing to build pier No. 1, the workers built a temporary construction bridge from the south bank to the north, driving guide piles at the location of the pier, and just as they were about to erect pile drivers to build a steel sheet pile cofferdam, ice floes suddenly floated down from the upper reaches in the middle of the night. The ice floes accumulated higher and higher, quickly rising more than a zhang above the water surface. With a thunderous roar, the ice floes crashed down, and all the guide piles and the temporary bridge were destroyed. How could work proceed in the face of the approaching ice age? The workers thought of a solution together, and finally decided to connect ten square iron boats into a floating platform, place the pile driver on it, float it to the location of the pier, and then pull steel cables from both banks to fix the floating platform and prevent the impact of ice floes. The workers, working hard for several days and nights on the hard ice layer, finally built the cofferdam. The island-building work and the caisson work were also completed successively.
    In May 1955, the peach blossom flood in the upper reaches of the Yellow River swept down again, and the steel sheet pile cofferdam was completely overturned. Continuing to drive steel sheet piles became a key issue in the progress of the project. The riverbed here is all hard granite, and steel sheet piles cannot be driven in. After everyone came up with a solution, it was decided to first sink huge wooden cages upstream of the pier to reduce the impact of the water flow, and then throw a large number of sacks near the pier, and drive steel sheet piles on the sacks, so that the steel sheet piles could stand firm. After the cofferdam was built, the leakage inside the cofferdam was very serious due to the large gaps in the sacks. Four water pumps were constantly pumping, and the accumulated water inside the cofferdam was sometimes as deep as a person's abdomen, and the work of laying the facing stones could not be carried out. To block the leaks, it was necessary to rearrange the thrown sacks in deep water and add a layer of red clay. At this time, it was December, the temperature dropped to minus ten degrees Celsius, and a thin layer of ice formed on the river surface. People felt the biting cold even when wearing thick cotton clothes. It is conceivable how difficult it would be to work in the water now. The workers did not bow their heads in the face of difficulties. They were determined to rush the repair of the piers out of the water before the Yellow River froze. They put on diving suits, washed their hands with wine, and jumped into the cofferdam one after another. After three days and three nights of intense work, they rearranged thousands of sacks and added a layer of red clay. The leak was blocked, and the No. 1 pier was finally completed after the No. 2 pier.
    The construction of the three arches and the bridge deck of the Yellow River Arch Bridge was carried out at a height of 30 to 40 meters above the Yellow River rapids. Ordinary people immediately feel dizzy when standing on it and looking down at the river. Building this project requires courage, composure, and care. The crane operators showed amazing bravery and wisdom in installing the steel arch frames. The steel arch frame is used to support the arch, and it must be erected on the pier before the arch is tied. This is a huge arc-shaped object, weighing more than 20 tons. In order to prevent personal accidents from happening, the workers stretched safety nets under the bridge arches, then put on their tools, climbed onto the piers dozens of meters high, and fastened their safety belts to their bodies to work. In this thrilling work, they also exceeded the quota by 22%. The rebar binding work for the arches and bridge deck was not only carried out at high altitudes, but also involved complex operating techniques. An arch has four layers of main bars and more than 300 stirrups, with a bar spacing of only three to five centimeters, as dense as a spider web, which is very inconvenient to operate. Most of the people who did this work were crane operators and concrete workers who had undergone short-term training and were not familiar with the business, but they still improved their work efficiency through hard work. The third arch took fourteen days, while the first and second arches were shortened to eight days.
    According to the plan of the First Engineering Bureau, the Baolan Railway was to lay 82 kilometers of track northward to Dijiatai in August. As a key project for the northward extension of the Baolan Railway, the main structure of the Yellow River Arch Bridge needed to be completed by May 10. However, thanks to the courage and wisdom of the workers, the bridge was completed twenty-three days ahead of schedule, on April 17. (Attached picture)

    我国跨度最大的黄河大拱桥建成了
    燕树桂
    在兰州以东，黄河穿过的十里山峡谷上，新建成了一座全长二百多公尺的三孔钢筋混凝土大拱桥。两个高高的桥墩，擎托着巨大的桥身，傲然挺立在波涛滚滚的黄河急流中。三个椭圆形的跨度五十三公尺的拱圈，像彩虹一样，把桥孔勾画得分外美丽。桥面板和拱圈之间的钢筋混凝土排柱，构成镂空的结构，人们透过它可以看到对面的景物。这个桥不仅适用、美观，而且由于它完全使用钢筋混凝土建成，比纯用钢材架桥可为国家节约三百吨钢材；一般铁桥可使用七、八十年，它可使用二、三百年，将来的养护费用也比较低廉。
    修建黄河大拱桥，是一个很复杂很艰巨的工程。特别是修建这样一座每孔跨度长达五十三公尺的大拱桥，是我国桥梁建筑史上从来没有过的。大拱桥的全部工程都是在险恶的黄河急流中和三、四十公尺的高空上进行，施工条件困难，技术要求复杂。
    修建这座桥梁的铁路职工，在黄河急流中日日夜夜地同洪水，有时还要同流冰、严寒搏斗。前年深冬准备修一号墩，工人从南岸向北搭起一个施工便桥，在桥墩的位置打下了导桩，将要架设打桩架筑钢板桩围堰的时候，深夜里，上游突然漂下冰凌，冰凌愈积愈高，很快就高出水面一丈多。一阵霹雳巨响，冰凌冲击下来，全部导桩和便桥被冲毁了。在冰期来临的情况下，怎么进行工作呢？职工们一起想办法，最后决定把十只方形铁船联成一个浮台，打桩架放在上面，浮到桥墩的位置，然后从两岸牵上钢丝绳，把浮台固定下来，防止冰凌的冲击。工人们在坚硬的冰层上，经过几天几夜的紧张劳动，终于把围堰筑成。筑岛工作和沉井工作也陆续完成了。
    1955年5月黄河上游的桃花汛又冲击下来，钢板桩围堰全部被拥倒了。继续打钢板桩成了工程进展中的关键问题。这里的河床全是坚硬的花岗岩，钢板桩打不进去。经过大家想办法，决定先在桥墩上游沉下庞大的木笼，降低水流的冲击力量，然后在桥墩附近投下大量麻袋，在麻袋上打钢板桩，这样才使钢板桩站稳。围堰筑成后，由于麻袋缝隙过大，围堰内漏水现象很严重，四部抽水机不停地抽动，围堰内的积水有的地方还深达人的腹部，砌镶面石的工作仍无法进行。要堵住漏水，就需要把投下的麻袋在深水中重新排列，再砌一层红胶泥。这时正是十二月，气温降到零下十几度，河面结成了一层薄冰，人们穿上很厚的棉衣都感到刺骨的寒冷，现在要在水里工作，困难是可以想见的。工人们没有在困难面前低头，他们一心要在黄河封冻以前把桥墩抢修出水面。他们穿好潜水衣，用酒洗一下手，便一个跟着一个跳进围堰里，经过三天三夜紧张地工作，他们把几千个麻袋重新排好，又砌了一层红胶土，漏水堵住了，第一号桥墩终于在二号桥墩以后也建成了。
    黄河大拱桥的三个拱圈和桥面板的工程，是在黄河急流上空三四十公尺高的地方进行的。一般人站在上面俯瞰河水，马上会头晕目眩。建设这个工程，需要勇敢、镇静、细心。起重工人在安装钢拱架中显示出惊人的勇敢和智慧。钢拱架是用以擎托拱圈的，在绑扎拱圈之前要架在桥墩上。这是一个弧形的庞然大物，一个有二十多吨重。工人们为了防止万一发生人身事故，在桥拱下面张起安全网，然后带上工具，攀上几十公尺高的桥墩，用安全带系住身体进行工作。在这样惊险的工作中，他们还突破了定额22％。拱圈和桥面板的钢筋绑扎工作，不仅在高空中进行，而且操作技术复杂。一个拱圈有四层主筋，三百多道镫筋，钢筋间距只有三到五公分，密得像蜘蛛网，操作很不方便。做这个工作的，大部分是经过短期训练的起重工和混凝土工，业务生疏，但在他们努力钻研下，仍提高了工作效率。第三号拱圈用了十四天，一号拱圈和二号拱圈却缩短为八天。
    按照第一工程局计划，包兰路要在八月间向北铺轨八十二公里到达狄家台，作为包兰铁路向北延伸的关键工程——黄河大拱桥需要在五月十日完成主体工程。可是，这座桥却在工人们的勇敢和智慧下提早二十三天、在四月十七日完工了。（附图片）
