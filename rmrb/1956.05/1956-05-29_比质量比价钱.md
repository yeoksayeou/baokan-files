Comparing Quality and Price

Editor's Note: The materials on product quality and price comparison published here, although dating back to 1955, are still worth publishing because the current situation has not changed much. These materials illustrate that there is great potential in industrial production. If the quality of backward factories is improved to the level of advanced factories, and the cost is reduced to the same level as advanced factories, then our people will be able to buy more inexpensive and high-quality industrial products, and the country can accumulate more funds each year. Therefore, we hope that the workers of factories with high prices and poor quality will work hard to learn from those similar factories with low prices and high quality, so as to catch up with the level of advanced factories in a short period of time.

The Changsha Shoe Production Cooperative and the Nanjing Local State-Owned Xinsheng Shoe Factory both produce men's leather shoes of the same style and size. The shoes made by the Changsha Shoe Production Cooperative are more delicately crafted, and the quality of the leather is also better, with a factory price of 9.84 yuan per pair; while the shoes made by the Nanjing Local State-Owned Xinsheng Shoe Factory are of poor quality, but the price is 14.75 yuan.

The Harbin State-Owned Factory 306 and the Local State-Owned Songjiang Leather Shoe Factory both produce the same style of black, high-top men's leather boots. According to consumer feedback: the boots made by Factory 306 are finely crafted, the soles are wear-resistant, and the uppers are durable and warm, with a low price – a factory price of 18.63 yuan per pair; the boots made by the Songjiang Leather Shoe Factory are water-sensitive, lose their shape, and the uppers crack and the soles break after only a short period of wear, and the price is high – a factory price of 22.32 yuan per pair, which is more than 19% higher than that of Factory 306.

The Sanxing brand drawing pencils produced by the Shanghai Joint State-Private China Pencil Factory No. 1 have good color, strong tinting strength, and are not easy to break. The factory price is 3.9 yuan per gross (twelve dozen). The Tianping brand drawing pencils produced by the Guangzhou Joint State-Private South China Pencil Factory have insufficient color, weak tinting strength, and dull paint on the pencil shafts. The factory price per gross is 7.3 yuan, almost twice as high as the Sanxing brand.

In December 1955, the factory price of the Chinese typewriter produced by the Shanghai Private Fan's Typewriter Factory was 365 yuan per unit. This typewriter is relatively good among domestic products. Its type characters are smooth and even, the rubber roller is of moderate hardness, the paper pressure spring is strong, the character wheel moves easily, and the machine parts are installed accurately. The disadvantage is that the type plate is relatively heavy, and the paper presser does not have a horizontal bar. The Tianjin Local State-Owned Red Star Factory also produced a Cultural Brand Universal Typewriter in 1955, with a factory price of 454.82 yuan per unit, which is 25.15% higher than that of Fan's factory. However, the quality is not as good as Fan's: the type characters are uneven and have burrs, the rubber roller has blemishes, the manuscript table is not straight, and the paper pressure is poor. Due to the combination of poor quality and high price, a total of 1,127 units were stockpiled last year.

In 1955, the Golden Dragon brand Model 38 mimeograph machine produced by the Shanghai Private Shen Hongji was brightly painted, light and flexible, the screen frame had strong elasticity, and it was easy to use. The disadvantage is that it does not clamp the paper tightly enough. The factory price per unit was 15.5 yuan. The Cultural Brand "71" model mimeograph machine produced by the Tianjin Local State-Owned Red Star Factory during the same period had a factory price of 47.66 yuan per unit, which is twice as high as the Golden Dragon brand. Its quality, except for clamping the paper tighter, is not as good as the Golden Dragon brand. For example, the wooden box is cracked, the screen frame has no elasticity, the workmanship is rough, parts fall off, and iron sheets are wasted. Also due to the combination of poor quality and high price, a total of 16,404 units were stockpiled last year.

    比质量比价钱
    编者按：这里发表的几种产品比质比价的资料，虽然都是1955年的事，但是因为目前的情况并没有多大改变，还是值得发表。这些资料说明，目前工业生产中的潜在力是很大的。如果落后的工厂的质量提高到先进工厂的水平，成本降低到先进工厂的一样，那末，我国人民就可以买到更多的价廉物美的工业品，国家每年就可以积累更多的资金。所以，我们希望现在价高质次的工厂的职工们，努力向那些价低质高的同类工厂学习，以便在短期内赶上先进工厂的水平。
    长沙制鞋生产合作社和南京地方国营新生制鞋厂，都生产一个式样一个尺寸的男皮鞋。长沙制鞋生产合作社的皮鞋的做工比较细致，皮革的质量也比较好，每双皮鞋出厂价为9.84元；而南京地方国营新生制鞋厂的鞋，质量不高，价钱却为14.75元。
    哈尔滨国营三○六工厂和地方国营松江皮鞋厂，都生产一个式样的黑色长统男皮靴。据消费者反映：三○六工厂的皮靴的做工细致，靴底耐磨，靴面耐穿保暖，价贱——每双出厂价为18.63元；松江皮鞋厂的皮靴怕水，走样，穿不了多久靴面就裂口，靴底就断裂，价又高——每双出厂价为22.32元，比三○六工厂的高19％以上。
    上海公私合营中国铅笔一厂生产的三星牌绘图铅笔颜色好，着色力强，不易断铅。每罗（十二打）出厂价3.9元。广州公私合营华南铅笔厂生产的天平牌绘图铅笔，颜色不够好，着色力较弱，笔杆油漆暗淡。每罗出厂价是7.3元，几乎比三星牌的高一倍。
    1955年12月，上海私营范氏打字机厂生产的中文打字机，每架出厂价为365元。这种打字机是国内产品中比较好的。它的铅字字身光滑平正，胶滚软硬适度，下压纸弹力足，人字轮移动轻便，机件安装准确。缺点就是字盘比较笨重，压纸器没有横条。天津地方国营红星工厂，1955年也生产一种文化牌万能式打字机，每架出厂价为454.82元，价钱比范氏厂的高25.15％。质量却比不上范氏的：铅字字身不平正，有毛刺，胶滚有斑疤，稿台不正，上下压纸力差。由于质次价高，去年共积压了1，127架。
    1955年上海私营沈鸿记生产的金龙牌38式油印机，油漆光亮，轻巧灵活，纱框弹力强，使用方便。缺点是扎纸不够紧。每架出厂价15.5元。天津地方国营红星工厂同时期生产的文化牌“71”式油印机，每架出厂价47.66元，比金龙牌的高两倍。它的质量，除扎纸比较紧以外，都比不上金龙牌的。如木箱开裂，纱框没弹力，做工粗糙，零件脱落，又浪费铁皮。也由于质次价高，去年共积压了16，404架。
