From central Sichuan, going north along the Fu River, one enters Pingwu County, nestled between the Daba Mountains and the Min River. Along the hundreds of miles of mountain roads with towering peaks and deep valleys, one can see people suspended by ropes from the mountaintops, chiseling rocks on the mountainsides. In order to bring the water from the Fu River, dozens of feet below, to irrigate the land, the 100,000 people of Pingwu County are advancing on nature with the great spirit of moving mountains and overturning seas!

	Breaking Open the "Tiger's Mouth"
	In Changgui Township, Pingwu County, there is a tall rock protruding into the Fu River called "Tiger's Mouth." Five miles downstream from "Tiger's Mouth" is a place called Anchang Dam. Although Anchang Dam is near the Fu River, the 180 mu of dry land on the dam has never been irrigated due to the obstruction of "Tiger's Mouth." Ancestors had put in a lot of effort, manually digging a three-mile-long stone ditch twice, but both times the ditch was too low to bring the water up.
	How could the dry land of Anchang Dam be turned into paddy fields? Zhao Peiji, director of the Changhewan Agricultural Cooperative in Changgui Township, replied, "If Dry Dam (referring to Anchang Dam) wants water, it has to break open Tiger's Mouth." When this plan was discussed among the members, everyone said, "Fearing the Tiger's Mouth means no increased production." On February 6th, the cooperative gathered thirty-two young, strong, and water-savvy individuals and organized a commando team to attack the "Tiger's Mouth." However, the steep rock face was impossible to climb. So, everyone drove a boat, built a scaffold on the boat, and drilled holes in the rock wall to install explosives. After blasting open the left side of the cliff, they continued to blast other parts of the "Tiger's Mouth." During the intense work, the steel chisels became blunt, and ironworker Tian Wenwan immediately sent newly forged chisels. The skin on people's hands cracked open, bleeding, but they applied medicine and continued working. After more than twenty days of effort, they finally blasted a tunnel more than three zhang deep through the "Tiger's Mouth," allowing the water of the Fu River to flow through on March 16th, turning the 180 mu of dry land on Anchang Dam into paddy fields.

		Water Comes from the Sky
	The four newly built canals in Gucheng Township all wind around the mountains. One of them draws water from the Fu River up a five or six zhang deep valley to Stone Horse Mountain. Initially, when people proposed drawing water up the mountain to turn the 200 mu of yellow mud land on Stone Horse Mountain into irrigated fields, Liu Yongzhong, a forty-six-year-old farmer, disbelievingly said, "To irrigate Stone Horse Mountain, unless the water comes from the sky." But Wang Zhenglun, director of the Torch Agricultural Cooperative, said, "As long as we organize, we can definitely turn the dry land into irrigated fields."
	Wang Zhenglun, the Party branch secretary, and comrades from the work team, a dozen people in all, climbed down the rocky slopes step by step. After nine days of surveying, they discovered that a twenty-li long canal could be built from Old Crow Mountain, through Zhoujia Mountain, Big Horse Ditch, and Little Horse Ditch, to irrigate Stone Horse Mountain. So, on January 10th, all 260-plus male and female members of the cooperative carried their bedding and tools to the mountain to start building the canal. The mountain was covered with stones, but the cooperative had no stonemasons. Just when they were at a loss, the nearby agricultural cooperative, mobilized by the Party branch, sent 160 members and five stonemasons to help. With the help of the experienced stonemasons, the members quickly learned the knowledge and methods of opening stone slopes.
	On March 9th, the twenty-li long canal was completed. When the river water was drawn up to Stone Horse Mountain through the Horse Ditch, people cheered. They said, "If Chairman Mao hadn't told us to plan, who would have thought that water could reach Stone Horse Mountain?"; "With the canal, Stone Horse Mountain doesn't have to worry about changing." The yellow mud land on Stone Horse Mountain, which originally only yielded eighty jin of corn per mu, has now become irrigated fields that can yield five hundred jin of rice per mu.

		Mud Crosses the River
	On the west bank of the Fu River, there was a farmer named Wang Laosan. When he was young and working in the fields, he looked at his fifteen mu of sandy land and then at the yellow mud slopes on the east bank of the Fu River. He thought, "If I could carry some yellow mud to the sandy land, wouldn't the sandy land become good fields too?" However, the merciless Fu River blocked him. In the days of individual farming, his ideal remained unrealized. Last year, sixty-year-old Wang Laosan joined the Mutian Agricultural Cooperative in Shuijing Township with his fifteen mu of sandy land. This spring, when discussing the draft agricultural development program, Wang Laosan brought up his ideal again. At that time, the cooperative management committee decided, based on his suggestion, to build a bridge over the Fu River so that yellow mud from the opposite mountain could be carried to the sandy fields on this side. Building a bridge required timber, and members Wang Guangyou and Wang Guanghui immediately lent two six- or seven-zhang tall trees from their ancestral graves to the cooperative. Thus, sawing timber, hammering stones, and building the bridge all started at once, and in just a few days, a wooden bridge was erected over the Fu River. From then on, more than a hundred members carried yellow mud from the east bank across the bridge to the west bank every day, transforming the barren sandy land on the west bank into fertile fields. Wang Laosan, who personally witnessed his long-cherished wish come true, happily said, "I never thought that yellow mud could cross the Fu River."

	Gold Belts Girdle the Mountainside
	Wang Jinyun's crops in Shikan Township were all planted on the slopes of the mountain. After sowing in the spring, whenever a strong wind blew, the seeds in the fields would flow down the mountain with the soil and stones with a rustling sound. After a mountain flood, the slopes became bare. When weeding, the corn growing on the slopes was constantly blown down by the wind. At that time, the hardworking Wang Jinyun had no choice but to bend down, take a stone, and prop up the corn stalks. Where the stones could not hold, he used branches and weeds to make fences to hold back the soil. Despite this, each mu of land only yielded one hundred and forty jin. This year, Wang Jinyun joined the Jianquan Agricultural Cooperative, and he and the members, following the instructions of the draft agricultural development program, decided to turn the slopes into terraced fields. On February 28th, the first production team mobilized thirty-one members, demolished the boundary walls along the slopes, and built rows of soil-retaining walls along the slopes. After each terrace was built, the soil on the slope was turned over to fill the ground flat, and then they continued to build upwards. In two days, this team turned sixteen mu of sloping land into terraced fields. From afar, the mountain slopes looked as if they were adorned with strips of gold. People happily said: With gold belts, grain will break the beams. The slopes, which originally only yielded more than a hundred jin, now yield 395 jin per mu after being terraced, increasing production by one and a half times.

	In the struggle to over fulfill the production increase plan, Pingwu County has turned 10,000 mu of dry land into irrigated fields and 100,000 mu of sloping land into terraced fields this year. Whenever these achievements are mentioned, people say that on the basis of agricultural cooperation, mountainous areas can also build socialism!

    为了建设山区
    孔繁祚
    从四川的中部出发，沿着涪江往北，走进大巴山和岷江之间的平武县。在重峰叠嶂、山高谷深的数百里山道上，沿途到处都能见到从山顶用绳索吊着人到山腰去开凿岩石的人群。为着把山脚下数十丈深的涪江的水搬到山上来灌溉土地，平武县十万人民正以移山倒海的伟大气魄，向自然界进军！
       凿开“老虎嘴”
    平武县长桂乡，有座高大的石岩伸入涪江，名叫“老虎嘴”。“老虎嘴”下游五里有个地方叫安长坝。安长坝虽临着涪江，但是因为“老虎嘴”的阻碍，坝上的一百八十亩旱地从没有上过水。祖先们曾费过不少心机，前后两次用人工凿了三里长的石沟，但是都因沟太低，上不去水。
    安长坝的旱地怎样才能变成水田呢？长桂乡长河湾农业合作社主任赵培基的回答是“旱坝（指安长坝）想打水，除非凿开老虎嘴”。当这个计划在社员中讨论的时候，大家说“惧怕老虎嘴就不能增产”。二月六日，社里聚集了三十二个年青力强、善识水性的人，组织了向“老虎嘴”开火的突击队。但是，峻峭的山岩上不去人。于是，大家便驾着船，在船上又搭起架子，在石壁上凿开炮眼安上炸药来炸。在炸开左边的削壁以后，他们又继续在别处对“老虎嘴”进行了爆炸。在紧张的工作里，钢钎钝了，铁工田文万立即送来了新打的钢钎。人们手上虎口震开了，淌出血来，上了药，便又继续工作。经过二十多天的努力，他们终于在“老虎嘴”上炸开了一条三丈多深的隧道，使山下的涪江水，在三月十六日经过老虎嘴流了过来，把安长坝上一百八十亩旱地变成水田了。
          水从天上来
    古城乡新修的四条渠埝，全部盘旋在大山上。其中有一条是从五六丈深的山谷里引涪江水上到石马山的。最初，当人们提出要引水上山，把石马山上二百亩黄泥地变水浇田的时候，四十六岁的农民刘永忠不相信地说：“要灌石马山，除非水从天上来。”但是火炬农业合作社主任王正伦说：“只要组织起来，一定能把旱地变成水浇田。”
    王正伦和党支部书记、工作组的同志等十多个人，踏着雪一步一步地爬下山岩；经过九天的勘察，发现可以从老鸦山经过周家山，大马渠、小马渠，修一条二十里路长的渠埝，来灌石马山。于是在一月十日，全社的260多个男女社员，便都带上被盖、工具爬到山上去开埝。山上遍地都是石头，可是社内没有石工。正在没有办法的时候，在党支部动员下，附近农业合作社派来了160个社员和五个石工前来支援了。在老石工的帮助下，社员们很快学到了开石坡知识和方法。
    三月九日这天，二十里长的渠埝打通了。当江水经过马渠引上石马山的时候，人们都欢呼起来了。他们说“不是毛主席叫我们规划，谁能想到水上石马山”；“石马山有了埝，不愁它不变”。原来每亩只收八十斤玉米的石马山黄泥地，今年却变成每亩能收五百斤稻谷的水浇田。
          泥巴过江
    涪江西岸有户农民叫王老三，年轻的时候在地里干活，他看着自己的十五亩沙地；又望着涪江东岸全是黄泥的山坡。他想：“要是挑些黄泥到沙地里，沙地不也就变成好田了吗？”可是，无情的涪江拦住了他。在单人独马单干的日子里，他的理想一直未能实现。去年，六十岁的王老三带着他的十五亩沙地一块入了水晶乡木天农业合作社。今年春天在讨论农业发展纲要（草案）的时候，王老三又把他的理想提出来。当时社管理委员会就根据他的意见，决定在涪江上修一座桥，以便把对面山上的黄泥巴挑到这边沙田来。搭桥要木料，社员王光友、王光蕙马上把祖坟上两棵六、七丈高的大树借给合作社。于是，锯木料的、打石头的、架桥的一齐动工，只用了几天时间就在涪江上架起一座木桥来。从此，每天都有一百多个社员，从东岸挑上黄泥巴过桥来到西岸，把西岸瘠薄的沙地改造成良田。亲眼瞧见多年愿望实现了的王老三，高兴得直说：“真没想到，黄泥巴也能过涪江。”
       山腰系上黄金带
    石坎乡王锦云的庄稼，全种在山坡上。春天播种完了，每遇大风吹来，田里的种子就随着泥土、石子哗哗地流到了山下。山洪一过，山坡地就变成了一片片的光板板。到薅草的时候，长在坡上的玉米又不断地被风吹着伏倒下来。勤劳苦作的王锦云，那时候，只好躬下腰去拿块石头，把玉米秆支撑起来；石头支不住的地方，就用树枝和杂草做成篱笆把土挡起来。尽管这样，但是每亩土地也只有一百四十斤的收获。今年，王锦云入了剑泉农业合作社，他和社员们照着农业发展纲要（草案）的指示，决心把山坡地变成梯田。二月二十八日这天，第一生产队出动了三十一个社员，把顺着山坡的界墙拆了，沿着山坡砌起一条条的保土墙。每砌好一梯，便把坡上的土翻下来把地填得平平的，于是再往上砌。两天中，这一个队就把十六亩坡地变成了梯田。老远望去，山坡上就像饰上了一条条的黄金带。人们高兴地说：有了黄金带，粮食压断梁。原来只收百多斤的坡地，变成梯田以后，每亩可收395斤，产量增加一倍半。
    在争取超额完成增产计划的斗争里，平武县今年把一万亩旱地变成了水浇田，把十万亩坡地变成了梯田。每当谈到这些，人们都说，在农业合作化的基础上，山区也能建设起社会主义来！
