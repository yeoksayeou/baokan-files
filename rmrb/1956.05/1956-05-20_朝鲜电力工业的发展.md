    The Development of the North Korean Electric Power Industry
    Cui Zaihe, Vice Minister of Electricity of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
    The electric power industry of Korea, like other sectors of the people's economy, is developing rapidly and has broad prospects for development.
    After the "August 15th" liberation, the Korean Workers' Party and the People's Government, in rapidly restoring and developing the people's economy, attached great importance to prioritizing the development of the driving force of the people's economy—the electric power industry. As early as 1946, most of the important power generation and supply equipment had been restored and reorganized. By 1948, the capacity of our power generation equipment, led by the Sup'ung Dam hydroelectric power plant, had reached the level of 1944 before liberation. The rapid recovery of the electric power industry played a huge role in developing the people's economy and improving the material and cultural living standards of urban residents and farmers, and enabled us to supply electricity to the people in the southern half of the peninsula for a considerable period after liberation.
    However, as everyone knows, due to the lack of sincerity of the US military authorities stationed in South Korea, and especially because they deliberately failed to fulfill their obligations stipulated in the electricity payment agreement, the power supply to the southern half was interrupted in May 1948.
    During the fierce three-year war launched by US imperialism, like other sectors of the people's economy, our electric power industry also suffered severe damage: 11% of power generation equipment capacity was completely destroyed, and 57% suffered moderate or severe damage; a total of 670 kilometers of transmission lines were completely destroyed. However, the atrocities of the US aggressors could not subdue the Korean people. In the extremely difficult wartime environment, the workers in the electric power industry newly built more than 500 kilometers of transmission lines and detour lines, including the 140-kilometer-long Changjiang (transliteration) transmission line. They also moved many facilities to safe areas, restoring and protecting equipment despite enemy bombing, thus ensuring the electricity supply for wartime industrial production and agricultural irrigation. During the Three-Year Plan for the recovery and development of the people's economy after the war, huge amounts of capital were used to develop the electric power industry. If the total investment in capital construction of the electric power industry in 1953 is taken as 100, it increased to 212.5 in 1954 and to 502.3 in 1955. Compared with the time of the armistice in 1953, power generation in 1955 increased nearly twofold, and it is expected to increase 4.3 times in 1956. Our main power plants, such as the Sup'ung Dam hydroelectric power plant, the Changjin River hydroelectric power plant, and the Hecheon River hydroelectric power plant, have all been repaired. At the same time, the substation and transmission line equipment leading to various important sectors of the people's economy have also been restored and reorganized, meeting the rapidly growing electricity needs after the war.
    In the restoration and construction of the electric power industry, the great Soviet Union and the people of various people's democratic countries have given our country enormous internationalist assistance.
    With the development of the electric power industry, the electrical equipment manufacturing industry has also developed rapidly. During the rule of Japanese imperialism, our electrical equipment manufacturing industry was only a small-scale electrical tool manufacturing factory built by the Japanese; but even these tool manufacturing factories, there was not one in the north. After liberation, we built the Jiangxi Electrical Equipment Factory. From 1947, we could manufacture our own electrical equipment such as electric motors, transformers, and wires. Later, a light bulb factory was built in Pyongyang. In 1949, the output of the electrical equipment industry increased more than eighty times compared to 1946. After the armistice, many electrical equipment factories were restored and expanded, and output increased rapidly. The output in 1955 increased more than 4.3 times compared to 1953.
    Due to the rapid development of power generation and electrical equipment manufacturing industries, enterprises and railways in the northern part of our country have received an increasing supply of electricity. The power for rural water conservancy and irrigation has now increased to more than 12,000 horsepower. There has also been a significant increase in the supply of electricity for civil and cultural facilities. By the end of September 1955, the total number of electric lights had increased more than four times compared to 1953. Cities and workers' districts have electric lights, and they are now being popularized in the countryside. Today, in the northern half of the republic, the amount of electricity supplied for lighting alone is equal to the total power generation in the southern half, and it is constantly increasing. In the northern half of our country, there is not only abundant electricity available, but also reserves.
    In contrast, the southern half of Korea under US occupation is extremely short of electricity, and the people in the southern half are indeed living in darkness. The current electricity supply for general power departments in the southern half has been reduced by one-tenth; according to so-called "emergency measures," civilian electric lights are limited to thirteen, and they must not be turned on for more than two hours; not only that, but due to the lack of electricity, the remaining few factories are also gradually shutting down.
    In view of the situation of the power generation industry in South Korea, the people in the northern half of the republic, despite the fact that the motherland has not yet been unified, out of genuine sympathy for the suffering of the people in the southern half, believe that it is our bounden duty to share some of our abundant electricity with them. In August 1955, the Minister of Electricity of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea put forward a proposal on supplying electricity to South Korea, but this proposal was rejected by the South Korean authorities.
    We can say that the electric power industry in Korea has broad prospects for development. The exploitable power resources in Korea roughly include hydropower, thermal power, tidal power, and atomic power. Among these four types of power resources, according to the current actual situation in Korea, the most favorable, most effective, and most realistic is hydropower.
    Korea has extremely favorable geographical conditions for hydropower generation. Centered on Ryanggang Province, there is a plateau area with an altitude of 1,500 meters; and near the east coast, there are many north-south mountain ranges; therefore, there are many favorable locations suitable for high-head power generation due to watershed changes. Not only that, because the Yalu River, the Chongchon River, and the Taedong River in the western region have slow currents, there are also many locations suitable for dam-type low-head power generation.
    Therefore, since 1949, the Republic government has made huge plans for hydropower generation. We have begun to investigate hydropower resources, and first organized forces to conduct surveys of river flows as basic data. After the armistice, the survey work has been carried out more actively.
    With the rapid development of various sectors of the people's economy, the need for electricity will also increase rapidly. Although there is still a surplus of power generation now, by 1961, there will no longer be excess electricity. Therefore, we must develop new power resources in a timely manner. The Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government have adopted and are adopting a policy of always prioritizing the development of electricity over other industries.
    First of all, in terms of building new power plants, the Jiangjie and Tullujiang power plants are currently being designed. These are large power plants, and their construction requires 638,000 tons of cement, 185,000 cubic meters of wood, and more than 30,000 tons of steel. This power plant is scheduled to begin construction in 1957. After the completion of this project, combined with the fully restored existing power plants, the total power generation in our country will increase to about twice the expected level in 1956 by 1961.
    While building new power plants, the Sup'ung, Changjin River, Hecheon River, and Pujon River power plants are being completely renovated. In order to maximize their power generation capacity, the installation of new technologies is constantly and rapidly being carried out.
    The rational distribution of the transmission line network is also being carried out as another important task. Because with the future industrialization of the country, the construction of new enterprises, and the relocation of industries, in order to supply electricity more economically and rationally, the transmission line network must be rationally distributed from the beginning. In particular, the distribution of the transmission line network in the past was mostly for the convenience of the Japanese monopoly capitalists themselves, so eliminating this shortcoming has become an extremely realistic task for our country.
    Agricultural management is also gradually developing towards electrification and mechanization. This year, efforts are being concentrated on building dozens of new substations, erecting approximately 700 kilometers of transmission lines, and also mass-producing electrical equipment such as electric motors for irrigation.
    All the staff of the electrical industry sector in our country are following the correct policies of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic government, fully mobilizing and utilizing our country's favorable natural, technical, and economic conditions, utilizing international assistance and internal potential, to lay the foundation for national industrialization, to produce the necessary electricity, and to ensure the flexible supply of electricity.

    朝鲜电力工业的发展
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国电气省副相　崔载河
    朝鲜的电力工业，同人民经济其他部门一样，正在迅速地发展着，并具有广阔的发展前景。
    “八·一五”解放后，朝鲜劳动党和人民政权在迅速恢复和发展人民经济方面，十分重视优先发展人民经济的原动力——电力工业。早在1946年，大部分重要电力生产设备和供电设备已得到了恢复和整理；至1948年，以水丰发电厂为首的我国发电设备的能力已达到了解放前1944年的水平。电力工业的迅速恢复，对发展人民经济和提高城市居民与农民的物质、文化生活水平起了巨大作用，并且使我们能够在解放后相当长一个时期内供电给南半部人民。
    但是，正如大家知道的，由于驻在南朝鲜的美国军事当局没有诚意，特别是由于他们故意不履行电费支付协定中所规定的义务，因而对南半部的供电工作于1948年5月陷于中断。
    在美帝国主义所发动的历时三年的激烈战争中，同人民经济其他部门一样，我国的电力工业也遭到了严重的破坏：在发电设备容量方面，有11％完全遭到了破坏，有57％遭到了中等程度或严重程度的破坏；总长达六百七十公里的输电线路完全遭到了破坏。但是，美国侵略者的暴行并不能使朝鲜人民屈服。在战时极为困难的环境里，电力工业部门职工新建了长达一百四十公里的长江（译音）输电线等全长达五百多公里的输电线和迂回线的工程。他们还把许多设备迁移到安全地带，冒着敌机轰炸恢复和保护设备，因而保证了对战时工业生产和农业灌溉的电力供应。在战后人民经济恢复发展三年计划中，巨额的资金是用来发展电力工业的。如以1953年电力工业的基本建设总投资为100，则1954年增至212.5，1955年增至502.3。同1953年停战时比较，1955年的发电量增加了近两倍，1956年预计将增加四点三倍。我国主要的发电厂水丰发电厂、长津江发电厂、虚川江发电厂等都已修复。同时，还恢复和整顿了通向各重要人民经济部门的变电、输电线路设备，满足了战后迅速增长的电力需要。
    在电力工业的恢复和建设中，伟大的苏联和各人民民主国家人民给了我国以巨大的国际主义的援助。
    随着电力工业的发展，电气器材制造工业也有了迅速的发展。日本帝国主义统治时，我国的电气器材制造工业仅仅是日本人建设的小规模电气工具制造工厂；但即便是这些工具制造工厂，在北部也没有一个。解放后，我们建设了江西电气器材工厂。从1947年起，我们就可以自己制造电动机、变压器、电线等电气器材。以后又在平壤建设了灯泡工厂。1949年电气器材工业产量比1946年增加了八十多倍。停战后，许多电气器材工厂都经过恢复和扩建，产量有了迅速的增长，1955年的产量比1953年增加到四点三倍以上。
    由于发电和电气器材制造工业的迅速发展，我国北部的企业和铁路得到了日益增加的电力供应。农村水利灌溉动力现在已增加到一万二千马力以上。对于民用和文化设施用电的供应，也有了显著的增加。1955年9月底，电灯总数增加到1953年的四倍以上。都市和工人区都有了电灯，现在正普及到乡村。今天在共和国北半部，仅就电灯供电量说，就等于南半部的总发电量，并且还在不断地增加。在我国北半部，不但有丰富的电力可以利用，而且还有储备。
    与此相反，在美国占领下的朝鲜南半部却非常缺乏电力，南半部人民的确是过着黑暗的生活。现在南半部对于一般动力部门的电力供应，已减少了十分之一；根据所谓“非常措施”，民用电灯都规定为十三支，并且不得开灯两小时以上；不仅如此，由于电力的缺乏，剩下的几个工厂也在陆续歇业。
    共和国北半部人民鉴于南朝鲜发电工业的这种情况，尽管祖国还没有统一，由于真心同情南半部人民的痛苦，认为把自己丰富的电力分一部分给他们是我们应尽的义务。1955年8月，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国电气相提出了关于供给南朝鲜电力的建议，但是这个建议却被南朝鲜当局拒绝了。
    我们可以说，朝鲜的电力工业还有发展的广阔前途。在朝鲜能够开发的电力资源，大致有水力发电、火力发电、潮力发电、原子发电等种。在这四种电力资源中，根据今天朝鲜的实际情况，最有利、最有效、最现实的首先是水力资源。
    朝鲜在水力发电方面具有极为有利的地理条件。以两江道为中心，展开着海拔达一千五百公尺的高原地带；而在东海岸附近，又有着南北走向的许多山脉；所以有许多由于流域变更而适宜于高落差发电的有利地点。不仅如此，由于西部地方的鸭绿江、清川江、大同江等大河流的水流缓慢，适宜于堤坝式低落差发电的地点也不少。
    因此，共和国政府从1949年起，已对水力发电作了巨大的规划。对于水力资源已着手调查，首先对于作为基本资料的河川流量，组织力量进行了勘察。停战后，勘察工作更加活跃地展开了。
    随着人民经济各部门的迅速发展，对于电力的需要也将迅速增长。尽管现在的发电量还有剩余，但是到了1961年，电力就将不再有多余。因此，我们必须及时开发新的电力资源。朝鲜劳动党与共和国政府对于电力的开发，采取了和正在采取经常优先于其他产业发展的政策。
    首先，在建设新的发电站方面，现在正在设计江界及秃鲁江发电厂。这是大型发电厂，它的建成需要六十三万八千吨水泥、十八万五千立方公尺的木材以及三万余吨钢材。这个发电厂预定在1957年起开始动工。这一工程完工后，与完全修复的原有发电厂合计，到1961年我国的总发电量就将增加为1956年预定水平的二倍左右。
    在兴建新发电厂的同时，并对水丰、长津江、虚川江、赴战江等发电厂进行完全的改建。为了使它们的发电能力提高到最高限度，正在不断地迅速进行新技术的装配工作。
    输电线路网的合理分布，也正在作为另一重要工作而进行着。因为随着将来国家的工业化、新企业的兴建以及工业重新配置工作的进行，为了更加经济而合理地供应电力，必须从一开始就合理地分布输电线路网。特别是过去输电线路网的分布，大部分是为了日本垄断资本家自己利用上的方便，所以消除这种缺点，就成为我国极为现实的任务。
    农业的经营也正逐渐地向着电气化与机械化的方向发展。今年年内正集中力量于新建数十个变电所，架设约七百公里的输电线路，此外并大量生产用于灌溉的电动机等电气器材。
    我国电气工业部门的全体工作人员，正遵照朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的正确政策，充分地动员、利用我国自然方面与技术、经济方面的有利条件、利用国际援助和内部潜力，为奠定国家工业化的基础、为生产必要的电力和保证电力的灵活供应而奋斗。
