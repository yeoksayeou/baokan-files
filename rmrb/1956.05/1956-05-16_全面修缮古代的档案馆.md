    Comprehensive Renovation of Ancient Archives

    An ancient archive in Beijing—the Huangshicheng (Imperial History Archives)—has now been cleared and is being prepared for renovation to display China's precious ancient historical archives.

    This ancient archive is located east of the Forbidden City and was built starting in the 13th year of the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty. The main buildings are the main hall and the east and west side halls. The entire structure of the main hall is made of stone, and the windows are also made of stone. Five wide stone doors lead directly into the hall, inside which is a stone platform more than one meter high, where the 153 original large golden cabinets that have been recently collected are placed. The entire building is designed for drainage, ventilation, and prevention of moisture damage to the archives. It is one of the rare ancient archive storage buildings in world history.

    This archive, with a history of more than 400 years, once stored the imperial writings, veritable records, sacred instructions, and secret classics of the feudal emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties. During the Ming Dynasty, it also stored a copy of the "Yongle Encyclopedia." However, during the era of reactionary rule, this rare ancient archive was damaged. Now, the State Archives Administration plans to carry out a comprehensive renovation to restore it to its original splendor. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全面修缮古代的档案馆
    在北京的一所古代的档案馆——皇史宬现在已经清理出来，准备修缮后在这里陈列我国古代珍贵的历史档案。
    这座古代档案馆在故宫以东，是明代嘉靖十三年开始建造的，主要建筑为正殿和东、西配殿。正殿的全部建筑都是石头结构，窗户也是石头制成的，有五个宽大的石门直通殿内，殿内建有一公尺多高的石台，放置着最近收集起来的一百五十三个原有的大金匮。整个建筑便于泄水、通风，并防止档案受潮湿。它是世界历史上稀有的古代保管档案的建筑物之一。
    这座有四百多年历史的档案馆曾经保管明、清两代封建帝王的御笔、实录、圣训和秘典等。明代也存放过“永乐大典”的副本。但在反动统治时代里，这座稀有的古代档案馆遭到破坏。现在，国家档案局计划进行全面修缮，使它恢复原来的壮观。（新华社）
