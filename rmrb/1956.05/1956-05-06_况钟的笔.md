　　Kuang Zhong's Pen
　　Ba Ren
　　After seeing the Kunqu Opera "Fifteen Strings of Cash," I can't stop thinking about Kuang Zhong's pen, which rose and fell three times.
　　Ever since Cangjie created characters and Meng Tian invented the brush, anyone who knew a little "zhī hū" would use a pen. Scholars used pens to write books, establish theories, and compose poems; farmers and merchants used pens to record tofu and white wine debts; even a character like Ah Q, before being shot, had to pick up a pen, lean on the ground, and draw a circle on the verdict, regretting that the circle wasn't round enough. This shows how useful the pen is.
　　Naturally, pens differ. We use either fountain pens or brushes, while Kuang Zhong used a cinnabar pen. Although Kuang Zhong was the Prefect of Suzhou, his job this time was to supervise executions. His duty was to check whether the prisoners and the names on the list were accurate. If they were, he could simply "verify the identity," wave his cinnabar pen, point to the name on the list, and have the executioner drag the person out and behead them. However, Kuang Zhong refused to do so. Whenever he heard a prisoner cry out for justice, the pen he picked up would not go down. He picked up the verdict and looked at it; it had been questioned and tried six times, passing through many hands, presumably confirming the case. He picked up the pen again, and again heard the prisoner cry out for justice and describe what happened, and again couldn't bring himself to mark the list. After a temporary investigation, the injustice was confirmed, but since he was the supervisor of executions, he had no right to interfere with the verdict. So he picked up the pen again, but again saw the prisoner's grievances unaddressed, and again couldn't bring himself to make the mark. He thought of human life as being of utmost importance, and that he must be responsible to the people. He finally made up his mind to take responsibility himself, postpone the execution, argue with the Governor based on reason, personally investigate, solve the case, and redress the injustice. Thus, Kuang Zhong's cinnabar pen finally marked the real murderer. It is clear that whether a person knows how to use a pen is a matter of great importance.
　　Our heads of organizations, unit leaders, and even general staff members all use pens. Some draft plans, manuscripts, etc., while others pick up a pen to comment on plans, manuscripts, or the like, either agreeing, proposing alternatives, or writing a name. But do we use our pens as cautiously and seriously as Kuang Zhong did? This is something we should really think deeply about. Among us, there is certainly no shortage of people like Kuang Zhong, who are good at seeing "people" under their pens and helping them with actions. But among us, there is also no shortage of people like Guo Yuzhi, who only know how to wave their pens, unable to see "people" under their pens; or who push any work upwards or downwards; merely pass it through their hands, sign their names, only examining whether their signatures are "flying dragons and dancing phoenixes," impressive enough to show their authority, and consider that they have used their pens.
　　Without a spirit of being responsible to the people, it is impossible to do things responsibly for the work. Kuang Zhong had "people" under his pen, which is the valuable spirit of Kuang Zhong's use of the pen.
　　But Kuang Zhong's use of the pen was not easy. First of all, this cinnabar pen had to mark the real murderer in order to eliminate the bad guys for society. And eliminating the bad guys is also protecting the good guys. But to achieve this, he had to launch a two-pronged struggle; on the one hand, he had to fight against subjectivists who only knew how to arrange the surface phenomena of events, and who would use "common sense" as the basis for reasoning, but did not study the essence of things. On the other hand, he also had to fight against bureaucrats who were satisfied with their high positions and generous salaries, signed documents with their eyes closed, and hated subordinates for raising different opinions, and deliberately set traps to make you jump in, in order to get rid of uncooperative cadres. In this way, Kuang Zhong's pen was caught between the pincers of the pens of the subjectivist Guo Yuzhi and the bureaucrat Zhou Cen. He had to fight his way out of the pincers of these two pens to find a path to the truth, which really required great courage and wisdom. But a person who can be responsible to the people will surely gain the support of the people's strength, and will have great courage; and a person who has the support of the people's strength will surely be able to concentrate the wisdom of the masses, and will have great wisdom. In this way, Kuang Zhong defeated the two pincers of pens and redressed the injustice. Kuang Zhong can be said to be a person who is good at using his pen.
　　People who use pens frequently and often write carelessly should not fail to think about Kuang Zhong's method of using the pen.

　　况钟的笔
　　巴人
    看了昆剧“十五贯”，叫我念念不忘的是况钟那枝三起三落的笔。
    自从仓颉造字、蒙恬造笔以来，凡是略识“之乎”的人，都是要用用笔的。读书人著书立说，吟歌赋诗，要用笔；种田的、赶卖买的，记记豆腐白酒账，要用笔；甚至像阿Q那样人物，临到枪毙之前，还要拿起笔来，伏在地上，在判决书上面画个圈圈，并且有慨于圈圈之画得不圆，这就可见笔之为用是大得很哩。
    自然，笔各有不同，我们用的或毛笔，或钢笔，而况钟所用的是朱砂笔。况钟虽然是苏州府尹，但这回担任的工作，却是监斩。他的职责就是核对犯人和榜上名字是否属实。如果属实，那就算他“验明正身”了，大可朱砂笔一挥，向榜上名字一点，叫刽子手拉出去，一斩了事的。然而况钟偏不这么做，一听到犯人呼冤，拿起来的笔，便点不下去了。拿过判决书来看，竟是三问六审，经过不少人手，想来案情属实；又拿起笔来，又听到犯人呼冤，并且自述经过，又点不下去了。经过临时一次调查，冤情已经属实，但他既是监斩官，无权过问判决，于是又拿起笔来，但又看到犯人含冤莫伸的情形，又点不下去。他想到人命关天，要对人负责。他终于立下决心，自担干系，延缓处斩，向巡抚大人据理力争，并且亲自勘察，破了案情，平反了冤狱。这样，况钟的朱砂笔，终于点中了真正的杀人犯。可见一个人会不会用笔是大有讲究的。
    我们的机关首长，单位的负责人，以至一般的工作人员，都是要用笔的。有的是起拟计划、稿件，等等，有的则是拿起笔来在计划、稿件之类上面批示一下，或同意，或另拟，或写上一个名字。但是，我们用笔有没有像况钟那样用得慎重而严肃？实在是大可深思一下的。我们之间固然不缺乏像况钟那样的人，善于在笔底下看到“人”，并且用行动来帮助用笔。但我们之间，也不缺乏像过于执那样的人，只知大笔一挥，看不到笔底下有“人”；或者把任何工作，往上一推，往下一压；自己仅仅经过手，签个名，只考究自己签名的字，是否“龙翔凤舞”，足够威势，也算是用过笔了。
    没有对人负责的精神，不可能作出对工作负责的事，况钟的笔底下有“人”，就是况钟用笔的可贵精神。
    但况钟的用笔是很不容易的。首先，这枝朱砂笔必须点中真正杀人犯，那才能为社会除掉坏人。而除掉了坏人，也就是保护了好人。但要做到这一点，他得展开两条路线的斗争；一方面，他要同只知排比事件的表面现象，并且会用“人之常情”来作推理根据，却不研究事情的实质的主观主义者作斗争。另一方面，他还要同满足于自己的高官厚禄，闭着眼睛签发文件，而又讨厌下属提出不同意见，为了去掉不顺手的干部，就故意设下陷阱叫你跳下去的官僚主义分子作斗争。这样，况钟的笔就是处在主观主义者过于执和官僚主义者周岑的两枝笔锋夹攻之间了。他要在这两支笔锋夹攻之间，杀出一条真理的路来，实在是需要有大勇气、大知慧的。但一个能对人负责的人，一定会得到人民力量的支持，就会有大勇气；而一个得到人民力量支持的人，一定能集中群众的知慧，就会有大知慧。况钟就这样地战胜了两支夹攻的笔锋，平反了冤狱。况钟可说是善用其笔的人了。
    经常用笔而又经常信笔一挥的人，是不能不想想况钟的用笔之法的。
