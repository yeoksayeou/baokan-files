　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Bulgaria has now cooperativized approximately 77% of its farmers and over 75% of its cultivated land. This is the result of the large-scale agricultural cooperativization movement that has been underway since the beginning of this year.

　　From January to mid-April this year, more than 282,000 individual peasant households across Bulgaria joined agricultural production cooperatives, more than nine times the number of households that joined cooperatives nationwide last year. Consequently, the land area of cooperatives increased by 8 million decares (each decare equals 1.5 Chinese mu). In many places, entire villages have been cooperativized.

　　Along with the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, the agricultural technical foundation is also constantly expanding. Currently, there are 160 machine tractor stations established throughout Bulgaria, possessing a total of 17,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 3,000 grain harvesting combines, and many other agricultural machines. It is expected that 17 new machine tractor stations will be established this year. Machine tractor stations and state farms will increase their equipment by more than 2,700 tractors, 1,300 harvesting combines, and many other pieces of technical equipment, most of which are manufactured domestically.

　　保农业合作化运动大规模展开
    据新华社讯　保加利亚目前已经有77％左右的农户和75％以上的耕地合作化了。这是今年以来农业合作化运动大规模开展的结果。
    从今年一月到四月中旬，保加利亚全国有二十八万二千多户个体农民加入了农业生产合作社，比去年全国加入合作社的农户多九倍以上。合作社的土地面积因而增加了八百万狄卡尔（每狄卡尔合一市亩半）。有不少地方全村都合作化了。
    随着农业合作化运动的发展，农业技术基础也在不断扩大。现在保加利亚各地建立的机器拖拉机站已经达到一百六十个，它们共拥有一万七千台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算）、三千台谷物收获联合机和许多其他农业机器。今年预计还将要建立十七个新的机器拖拉机站。机器拖拉机站和国营农场今年将增加两千七百多台拖拉机，一千三百多台收获联合机和许多其他大部分是由本国制造的技术装备。
