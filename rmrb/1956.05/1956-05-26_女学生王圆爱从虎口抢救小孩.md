Female Student Wang Yuan'ai Rescues Child from Tiger's Jaws

    On the evening of April 28th, in Qiancangwu, He Village, Yutou Township, Jiangshan County, Zhejiang Province, Wang Chongxiang and six or seven other children were playing under a pear tree in front of their house. Suddenly, a tiger came down from the mountain and bit Wang Chongxiang in the waist. The children were terrified and began to cry.

    At this time, the seventeen-year-old girl Wang Yuan'ai was helping her mother make new tea in the kitchen. Hearing the children crying, she immediately rushed out. She saw a tiger carrying a child, dragging him forcefully up the mountain. The child was crying. She immediately mustered her courage and chased after the tiger.

    When she was only twenty meters away from the tiger, the tiger suddenly dropped the child, turned its head, bared its fangs, and roared. At this moment, Wang Yuan'ai fearlessly rushed forward to rescue the child. The tiger, afraid that the child would be snatched away, turned around again, bit the child, and hurriedly ran up the mountain.

    Wang Yuan'ai immediately picked up two stones and ran towards the main road, overtaking the tiger. The tiger dropped the child again to intimidate her. They chased and stopped, stopped and chased. Wang Yuan'ai chased and shouted loudly. The tiger was forced to jump onto the hillside, cross the hillside, and flee towards the cliff top on the mountainside. Wang Yuan'ai rushed to chase from under the cliff, but slipped and rolled straight down from the mountainside.

    Her roll startled the tiger. The tiger left the child on the ground, jumped onto the hillside, and stared at the child, waiting for movement. When Wang Yuan'ai saw the child on the ground, she forgot the pain, got up from the ground and rushed forward, holding the severely injured child tightly in her arms. At this time, although she was exhausted, she was very excited to have rescued the child from the tiger's jaws. Sitting on the ground, she looked at the tiger, and the tiger looked at her.

    At this extremely tense moment, villagers came running. Seeing more and more people, the tiger drooped its head dejectedly and fled.

    The child, Wang Chongxiang, was severely injured. The tiger had bitten twenty-eight tooth holes, large and small, in his waist and abdomen. After emergency treatment by the doctor that night, his life was no longer in danger.

    Wang Yuan'ai, who saved a life from the tiger's jaws, is the daughter of a poor peasant, a member of the Communist Youth League, and a sixth-grade student at the Second Central Primary School in Yutou District, Jiangshan County. She is a "three-good" student in school, loves labor, respects teachers, and cares for classmates. Her academic performance in every subject is above ninety points. She is also very active in social work such as flood control, afforestation, and literacy campaigns. (Xinhua News Agency)

    女学生王圆爱从虎口抢救小孩
    四月二十八日傍晚，浙江省江山县淤头乡和村前仓坞地方，王崇项等六、七个孩子正在门前梨树底下玩耍。突然，一只老虎从山上下来，咬住了王崇项的腰部，孩子们吓得哭起来了。
    这时，十七岁的姑娘王圆爱正帮助母亲在灶间里做新茶，听见孩子们一片哭声，立刻冲出门来，看到一只老虎衔着一个小孩正用劲地往山上拖，被衔的孩子还在哭叫。她立即鼓起勇气，跟着老虎向前追去。
    直到离开老虎只有二十公尺光景，老虎突然丢下小孩，扭转头，张牙舞爪，怒吼起来。这时王圆爱奋不顾身，一股劲奔往前去抢救小孩，老虎怕小孩被她抢去，又掉转头咬住了小孩，急急地往山上跑去。
    王圆爱立即捡起两块石头奔往大路，超越到老虎前面。老虎又丢下了小孩向她示威。这样追追停停，停停追追。王圆爱一面追，一面大声地叫喊。老虎被她逼得纵上山坡，翻过山坡，向山腰石崖顶上逃去。王圆爱从石崖下抢先追去，却滑了一跤，从山腰里直滚下来。
    她这一滚，却把老虎吓了一跳，老虎把小孩丢在地上，纵上山坡，两眼瞪着小孩，等待动静。王圆爱看到了地上的小孩，忘记了痛，从地上爬起来就冲上前去，把身受重伤的小孩紧紧地抱在怀里。这时她虽然已经精疲力尽，但到底从虎口中救出了小孩，感到非常兴奋。坐在地上，她看着老虎，老虎也看着她。
    正在这万分紧张的时刻，村里有人追上来了，老虎见人越来越多，就垂头丧气地逃跑了。
    孩子王崇项已经身受重伤，腰、腹被老虎咬了大小二十八个牙齿洞，当夜经医生急救，已经没有生命危险。
    从虎口里救下一条生命的王圆爱，是贫农的女儿，青年团员，在江山县淤头区第二中心小学六年级读书。她在学校里是“三好”学生，平时热爱劳动，尊敬老师，爱护同学，每科学业成绩都在九十分以上。她在抗洪、绿化、扫盲等社会工作中也很积极。　（据新华社讯）
