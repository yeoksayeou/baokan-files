Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 15th - According to a report by the German News Agency, the Adenauer government's attempt to establish a 500,000-strong army through compulsory conscription has met with widespread public opposition in West Germany.

    Brenner, chairman of the West German Metalworkers' Union, said at a union rally in Hamburg: The Metalworkers' Union firmly supports the decision of the West German Trade Union Federation to oppose the remilitarization of West Germany and the will of the West German trade union youth to oppose conscription.

    Participants in the Hamburg District Representative Conference of the Social Democratic Party unanimously passed a resolution to the Social Democratic Party parliamentary group opposing conscription and the establishment of a 500,000-strong army.

    At the Rhineland-Palatinate State Congress of the Free Democratic Party, many speakers also opposed conscription.

    The Central Committee of the Social Democratic youth organization "Socialist Youth" issued a statement strongly protesting against the "Military Protection Law" drafted by the West German authorities. According to this law, any criticism of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's army will be subject to legal sanctions.
