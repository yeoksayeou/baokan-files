　　Ngo Dinh Diem Authorities Intensify Provocative Actions in the Demilitarized Zone
　　Vietnam People's Army Lodges Protest with the French Side
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 5th: According to Vietnam News Agency, the Vietnam People's Army, on May 4th, lodged a protest with the French Union Forces regarding Ngo Dinh Diem's intensified provocative actions in the Demilitarized Zone.
    The protest letter presented the facts of Ngo Dinh Diem's recent provocations: on April 20th, Ngo Dinh Diem's troops opened fire on fishing boats of residents on the river in the Demilitarized Zone; on April 23rd, 26th, 27th, and 28th, Ngo Dinh Diem's police continuously and illegally opened fire in the southern part of the Demilitarized Zone; on April 29th, Ngo Dinh Diem's special agents brazenly told people who were prevented from entering the Demilitarized Zone that the Demilitarized Zone would be abolished after the French troops withdrew from South Vietnam; on April 30th, a platoon of troops from Ngo Dinh Diem's authorities invaded Xuan My village in the southern part of the Demilitarized Zone.
    The Vietnam People's Army pointed out that the above actions violated Articles 1, 6, 7, and 24 of the Geneva Accords and the regulations of the Demilitarized Zone, making the situation in this area even more tense.
    The Vietnam People's Army emphasized that while the French Union Forces delegation recently declared that it would withdraw from the Joint Commission at its own discretion, these illegal actions clearly indicate that the South Vietnamese authorities are conspiring to undermine the Demilitarized Zone regulations, turning the temporary military demarcation line into a political and territorial border, in order to permanently divide Vietnam and rekindle the flames of war.
    The Vietnam People's Army demanded that the French side take necessary measures to end this situation, in order to ensure that the regulations regarding this area are strictly observed, and to guarantee the demilitarized nature of the Demilitarized Zone.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 4th: According to Vietnam News Agency, the delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army stationed at the Central Joint Ceasefire Commission protested against the French Union Forces for condoning the illegal import of arms, military supplies, and military personnel into South Vietnam by the United States.
    In a letter delivered to the French Union Forces on April 26th, the delegation of the Vietnam People's Army pointed out that the French Union Forces' condoning of these illegal imports is a serious violation of the Geneva Accords.
    The Vietnam People's Army's letter stated that on March 31st, the United States transferred eight armored boats to the South Vietnamese army; in the same month, it also transferred an armed warship of the landing craft type. In addition, U.S. military aircraft have been continuously importing military personnel and military supplies into South Vietnam. In March alone, U.S. aircraft landed eight times at Tan Son Nhut Airport (Saigon) and Nha Trang Airport.
    The Vietnam People's Army demanded that the French Union Forces take all necessary measures to end these violations of the agreement, and to report these measures to the Central Joint Ceasefire Commission.

    吴庭艳当局在非军事区变本加厉地进行挑衅行动
　　越南人民军向法方提出抗议
    新华社河内5日电　据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军五月四日就吴庭艳在非军事区进行变本加厉的挑衅行动，向法兰西联邦部队方面提出抗议。
    抗议书提出了吴庭艳最近的挑衅的事实：四月二十日，吴庭艳军队对非军事区河上居民的渔船开枪；四月二十三日、二十六日、二十七日和二十八日，吴庭艳警察连续地在非军事区南部非法开枪；四月二十九日，吴庭艳特务厚颜地告诉因为被他们阻挠而不能进入非军事区的人民说，在法国军队从南越撤走后，非军事区就将取消；四月三十日，吴庭艳当局的一排军队侵入非军事区南部的春美村。
    越南人民军指出，上述行动违反了日内瓦协定第一、第六、第七和第二十四条以及非军事区条例，使这个地区的局势更加紧张了。
    越南人民军强调指出，在法兰西联邦部队代表团最近宣称它将随自己的意思撤出联合委员会的同时，这些非法行动清楚表明南越当局正阴谋破坏非军事区条例，使临时军事分界线成为政治和领土疆界，以便使越南永久分裂并且重新燃起战火。
    越南人民军要求法方采取必要措施来结束这种局面，以便保证关于这个地区的条例得到严格遵守，并且保证非军事区的非军事性质。
    新华社河内4日电　据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军总司令部驻越南中央联合停战委员会代表团抗议法兰西联邦部队纵容美国把军火、军需物资和军事人员非法运入南越。
    在四月二十六日送交法兰西联邦部队的一封信中，越南人民军代表团指出，法兰西联邦部队对这些非法输入的纵容，是严重违反日内瓦协定的。
    越南人民军的信说，在三月三十一日，美国曾经把八艘装甲船只移交给南越军队；同月，又移交了一艘登陆艇类型的武装舰只。另外，美国军用飞机还不断把军事人员和军需物资输入南越。单是在三月里，美国飞机就在新山一机场（西贡）和芽庄机场着陆八次。
    越南人民军要求法兰西联邦部队采取一切必要措施来结束这些违反协定的情形，并且把这些措施向中央联合停战委员会报告。
