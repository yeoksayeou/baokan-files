    The Chinese people and the Egyptian people have heard with equal excitement the good news: the government of the Arab Republic of Egypt officially announced on May 16 its recognition of the People's Republic of China, its willingness to establish diplomatic relations, and the exchange of diplomatic envoys. The next day, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country also issued statement, expressing a warm welcome to the friendly decision of the Egyptian government.
    This important development in the relations between China and Egypt is fully in line with the common aspirations and interests of the two peoples. China and Egypt are both ancient and young countries. In the past, we suffered from the pain of foreign enslavement, and our economy and culture were suppressed. But now, we have all broken free from the shackles of colonialism, established independent countries, and embarked on the road of national rejuvenation. Our wish is to build our own countries on our own land, develop our own economies, and make our culture shine again. We all love peace and hope to cooperate friendly with the people of all countries in the world. Since the day of its establishment, the People's Republic of China has expressed its willingness to establish diplomatic relations with any foreign country that abides by the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and has always unswervingly implemented a peaceful foreign policy. The government of the Arab Republic of Egypt has also repeatedly announced its determination to implement an independent and peaceful policy. Therefore, the friendly relations between China and Egypt have a deep common foundation.
    China and Egypt participated in the Asian-African Conference with peaceful aspirations. During this conference, the prime ministers of China and Egypt had friendly contacts, which greatly enhanced mutual understanding between the two countries. Since then, the friendly cooperation, cultural and trade exchanges between our two countries have greatly developed. For more than a year, many religious, political, academic, and journalistic figures and groups from Egypt have visited our country, and religious and academic figures and cultural and art delegations from our country have also visited Egypt, and signed the Sino-Egyptian Cultural Cooperation Agreement. After the signing of the Sino-Egyptian Trade Agreement in August 1955, the two countries established commercial representative offices in each other. Recently, the Chinese trade delegation visited Egypt, and the two sides reached a transaction amount of four million pounds. All of these have had a beneficial effect on the lives of the people of the two countries and strengthened the sincere friendship between the people of the two countries. If we have been able to make these gratifying achievements in the past, then, without a doubt, under better conditions in the future, the prospects for friendly cooperation between our two countries will be even broader.
    The significance and impact of Sino-Egyptian friendly relations go far beyond the scope of China and Egypt. It also marks the increasing unity between China and Arab countries and the closer alliance between Asia and Africa. This is an indispensable part of realizing the Bandung Spirit. This is the result of China and Egypt's active implementation of the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference, and at the same time it will promote the progress of the Bandung Spirit. We believe that the progress of Sino-Egyptian friendly relations will have a positive impact on the entire Asian and African region and will contribute to the cause of peace.
    In ancient times, the people of Egypt and the people of China created miracles: they built the world-famous pyramids and the Great Wall with their labor and wisdom. Today, we are willing to work together with the Egyptian people and with the people of all countries to create a pyramid of international cooperation and a Great Wall of world peace! No force in the world can prevent the friendship and cooperation between China and Egypt. No force in the world can prevent the victory of the peaceful and friendly cause of the people of all countries.

    欢迎埃及政府的友好决定
    中国人民和埃及人民怀着同样兴奋的心情听到一个好消息：埃及共和国政府于五月十六日正式宣布承认中华人民共和国，愿意建立外交关系，互换外交使节。第二天，我国外交部也发表声明，对埃及政府的这一友好决定表示热烈欢迎。
    中埃两国关系的这一重要发展，是完全符合两国人民的共同愿望和利益的。中国和埃及都是古老而又年轻的国家。过去，我们受过外国奴役的痛苦，我们的经济和文化遭到压制。但是现在，我们都摆脱了殖民主义的锁链，建立了独立的国家，走上民族复兴的道路。我们的愿望是，在自己的土地上建设自己的国家，发展自己的经济，并且使我们的文化重新发出光芒。我们都爱好和平，希望同世界各国人民友好合作。中华人民共和国从成立的一天起，就表示愿意同遵守平等、互利和互相尊重主权和领土完整的任何外国建立外交关系，并且始终不渝地执行和平外交政策。埃及共和国政府也一再宣布它决心实行独立和平政策。因此，中埃两国的友好关系是有着深厚的共同基础的。
    中国和埃及怀着和平的愿望参加了亚非会议。在这次会议期间，中埃两国总理进行了友好的接触，大大地增进了两国的互相了解。从那以后，我们两国之间的友好合作、文化和贸易交流有了很大的发展。一年多以来，埃及的许多宗教、政治、学术和新闻界人士和团体到我国访问，我国宗教、学术界人士和文化艺术代表团也访问了埃及，并签订了中埃文化合作协定。1955年8月中埃贸易协定签订以后，两国又彼此设立了商务代表处。最近，中国贸易访问团访问埃及，双方达成了四百万英镑金额的交易。所有这些都在两国人民的生活中发生了有益的作用，加强了两国人民之间的真诚友谊。如果说，过去我们已经能够做出这些令人喜悦的成就，那末，毫无疑问，在今后更好的条件下，我们两国之间的友好合作的前途将是更加广阔的。
    中埃友好关系的意义和影响，远远超出中埃两国的范围，它也标志着中国和阿拉伯国家的团结的日益加强，标志着亚洲和非洲更紧密地携起手来了。这是实现万隆精神所不可缺少的内容。这是中国和埃及积极执行亚非会议决议的结果，同时它又将推动万隆精神的前进。我们相信，中埃友好关系的进展，将在整个亚非地区产生良好的影响，并且是对于和平事业的贡献。
    在古代，埃及人民和中国人民曾经创造过奇迹：他们用自己的劳动和智慧建筑了举世闻名的金字塔和万里长城。今天，我们愿意和埃及人民共同努力，和各国人民一道，来缔造国际合作的金字塔和世界和平的万里长城！世界上没有任何力量能够阻止中埃两国的友谊和合作。世界上也没有任何力量能够阻止各国人民的和平友好事业的胜利。
