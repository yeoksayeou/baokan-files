Xinhua News Agency, May 26th News – According to the US Information Service, US President Eisenhower delivered a speech on US foreign policy at Baylor University in Texas on May 25th.

In his speech, Eisenhower first smeared communism. He insisted that communism was a "failure," but he also admitted that communist ideology today "has already dominated a large part of the world and billions of people in the world."

Eisenhower then discussed the US attitude towards rising nationalism. He said, "Today, the most stubborn manifestation of the aspirations of the people of all countries seems to be intense nationalism," and they demand the "right to establish their own political systems," which is "nothing to be afraid of." But he also said that the rise of new countries and their "progress towards independent status" has created "new political boundaries." He explicitly expressed dissatisfaction with the "economic barriers" and "political barriers" formed by these political boundaries. He believes that these countries' "emotional demand to survive completely independently" is "in conflict" with their desire to obtain Western assistance to develop their economies.

Eisenhower then talked about the "cooperation" of "free nations." He particularly promoted the idea of "Western European unification" and the establishment of a "United States of Europe" in Western Europe, like the United States of America. He admitted that this idea has not been realized so far, because "each country is proud of its separate existence," and "people are very worried about losing their cherished local traditions, cultures, and political systems in this union."

Eisenhower believes that the North Atlantic Group and various other European groups and alliances established so far under the leadership of the United States are "progress" in "unifying Europe," but at the same time he had to admit that even these alliances and groups have encountered "setbacks and difficulties."

Apparently focusing on the profound crisis the North Atlantic Group is experiencing, Eisenhower emphasized that cooperation should be "developed" in "various ways and through various institutions" within the North Atlantic Group. He stated that if Western countries cannot "cooperate more effectively to solve common problems," they will not be able to win the current struggle.

Eisenhower also said that the United States "must indeed be a partner for peace, freedom, and prosperity." In this regard, he talked about developing trade and economic relations between the United States and other capitalist countries. He emphasized the importance of winning over backward countries and advocated that the United States should impart knowledge and technology to these countries. He believes that any "hesitation" or "penny-pinching" by the United States in "assisting" backward countries will cause "greater risks and much greater losses" to the United States.

Eisenhower finally said that it is "useless" to talk about common interests with other countries only from the aspect of "defensive measures." Security cannot be achieved solely by armaments, no matter how great the destructive power of these weapons or how large their number. He said: "Some ways should be found and implemented to make cultural and economic assistance more meaningful to the strength, stability, and unity of the free world than purely military measures." He stated that these aspects he talked about represent the long-term policy of the United States rather than "expedient arrangements."

    艾森豪威尔发表关于美国外交政策的演说
    他承认美国拼凑的各种联盟和集团遭到挫折和困难
    新华社26日讯　据美国新闻处报道，美国总统艾森豪威尔二十五日在得克萨斯州的贝勒大学发表了一篇关于美国外交政策的演说。
    艾森豪威尔在演说里首先对共产主义进行了污蔑。他硬说共产主义是一个“失败”，但是他又承认，共产主义思想今天“已经在世界上很大部分地区和世界上的亿万人民中间占据了支配地位”。
    艾森豪威尔接着谈到美国对于高涨中的民族主义的态度。他说，“今天各国人民的志趣的最顽强的表现似乎是强烈的民族主义”，他们要求有“建立他们自己的政治制度的权利”，而这些并“没有什么可怕”。但是他又说，新国家的兴起并且“朝着独立地位前进”，这就造成了“新的政治界线”。他对由于这种政治界线而形成的“经济壁垒”和“政治壁垒”明白地表示不满。他认为这些国家想要“完全独立生存的感情上的要求”同它们想要得到西方的援助来发展经济的打算是“互相抵触”的。
    艾森豪威尔接着谈到“自由国家”的“合作”。他特别鼓吹了“西欧统一”和在西欧建立一个像美利坚合众国一样的“欧洲合众国”的主张。他承认：这种主张到现在还没有能够实现，这是因为“每个国家对于单独存在感到自豪”，而且“人们非常担心在这种联合内会丧失他们所珍惜的当地传统、文化和政治制度”。
    艾森豪威尔认为迄今已经建立的以美国为首的北大西洋集团和其他各种欧洲集团和联盟是在“统一欧洲”方面的“进展”，但是他同时却不得不承认，即使是这些联盟和集团也遭到了“挫折和困难”。
    显然是着眼于北大西洋集团正在遭遇的深刻危机，艾森豪威尔强调应当“发展”北大西洋集团的“各种不同方式和通过各种不同的机构”进行的合作。他表示，如果西方国家不能“更有效地合作来解决共同问题”，它们就无法赢得当前的斗争。
    艾森豪威尔又说，美国“必须的确是争取和平、自由和繁荣的伙伴”。在这方面，他谈到要发展美国同其他资本主义国家之间的贸易和经济关系。他强调争取落后国家的重要性，并且主张由美国来向这些国家传授知识和技术。他认为美国在“援助”落后国家方面的任何“犹预”或者“省小钱”，都会对美国引起“更大的风险和更大得多的损失”。
    艾森豪威尔最后说，光从“防御措施”方面来谈同其他国家的共同利益是“没有用处的”。安全不能光靠武装来实现，不管这些武器的摧毁力量有多大，或者它们的数量有多少。他说：“应该找到和执行一些办法来使文化和经济援助对于自由世界的实力、稳定和团结比纯军事措施有更大意义”。他表示他所谈的这些方面代表着美国的长期政策而不是“权宜的安排”。
