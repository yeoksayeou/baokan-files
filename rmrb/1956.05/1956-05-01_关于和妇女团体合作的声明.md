The Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation, meeting in Beijing from April 24 to 30, 1956, seriously considered issues concerning the status of women, the well-being of children, and women's contributions to peace and international understanding.

The recent improvement in the international atmosphere makes our work more urgent and important than at any time before. Because women's efforts can become a powerful influence, turning today's hopes into tomorrow's reality. Although many problems remain to be solved, the achievements already made have greatly strengthened women's confidence, convinced that they themselves have the power to create a better and happier life for themselves and their children, and help lay the foundation for lasting peace.

Many different national and international women's organizations have made important contributions to the progress that has been made, some working towards the realization of specific goals, others with more general aims, but all, in different ways, are concerned with the fundamental needs and aspirations of women. The Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation reiterates its admiration for the role these organizations have played in the past and continue to play.

We believe that further close relations between all groups dedicated to these common goals can be of great significance in consolidating the achievements already made and making more rapid progress in the near future. The Women's International Democratic Federation has consistently sought cooperation with other organizations since its establishment in 1945, and today such cooperation can be more fruitful than ever before.

The Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation once again declares its willingness to cooperate with national and international organizations and groups, as well as individual women, who are working for peace, women's rights and the protection of children. Therefore, we call on our national member organizations and all organizations and groups that have worked closely with the Women's International Democratic Federation to seek cooperation with other women and women's organizations on issues where common agreement can be reached.

This cooperation will lead to a common understanding among women with many different backgrounds and perspectives. Through joint cooperation, we will learn to value each other's different perspectives and, based on our common experience, move forward with rapidly increasing strength towards the realization of the great hopes for the future of humanity that are shared by women around the world.

    关于和妇女团体合作的声明
    1956年4月24日到30日在北京举行会议的国际民主妇女联合会理事会，认真地考虑了涉及妇女地位、儿童幸福和妇女对和平与国际谅解作出贡献的一些问题。
    最近国际气氛的改善使我们的工作比以前任何时期都更为迫切和重要。因为妇女的努力能够成为一个强有力的影响，把今天的希望变成明天的现实。尽管有许多问题仍然有待解决，但是已经获得的成就大大地加强了妇女的信心，深信她们自己有力量为自己和她们的孩子们，帮助创造更美好、更幸福的生活，并有助于奠定持久和平的基础。
    许多不同的全国性和国际性的妇女团体对于已经取得的进展，作出了重要的贡献，有的团体是从事某些具体目的的实现，有的具有比较一般性的目的，但是都是在不同的方式之下，关心着妇女的根本需要和愿望。国际民主妇女联合会理事会对这些团体在过去和现在所起的作用，再度表示钦佩。
    我们相信，致力于这些共同目的的所有团体之间关系的进一步密切，能够对巩固已经取得的成就和在最近的将来取得更加迅速的进展，具有非常重大的意义。国际民主妇女联合会自从1945年成立以来，一贯谋求同其他团体合作，而今天这种合作能够比以往任何时候，都更富有成果。
    国际民主妇女联合会理事会再一次声明它愿意和那些为和平、妇女权利和保卫儿童而努力的全国性和国际性的组织和团体以及个别妇女进行合作。因此，我们号召我们的各国会员团体和已同国际民主妇女联合会密切合作的一切组织和团体，在那些能够达成共同协议的问题上，寻求同其他妇女和妇女团体的合作。
    这种合作将导致有着许多不同背景和见解的妇女之间的共同谅解。通过共同合作，我们将学会重视彼此所持的不同观点，并在我们共同经验的基础上，以迅速增强的力量向着实现全世界妇女共同抱有的对人类未来的伟大希望的方向前进。
