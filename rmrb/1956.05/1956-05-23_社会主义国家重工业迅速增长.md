    Rapid Growth of Heavy Industry in Socialist Countries
    (Our Dispatch) How many tons of steel, coal, and kilowatt-hours of electricity do socialist countries produce annually now? What is the scale of their heavy industry production development? An article written by Zaharov, deputy director of the Soviet Central Economic Relations Bureau, published in a recent issue of the Soviet magazine "International Life," provides a general description of this issue of general concern.
    The article states that in 1955, socialist countries collectively mined approximately 880 million tons of coal, produced over 46 million tons of pig iron, approximately 62 million tons of steel, and approximately 260 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. Currently, socialist countries are successfully implementing grand plans for the further development of the national economy. In the next five years, the output of heavy industry in these countries will greatly increase. According to the author's estimate, by 1960, the output of heavy industry in socialist countries will reach: coal - approximately 1.25 billion tons, pig iron - approximately 62 million tons, steel - approximately 95 million tons, and electricity - approximately 470 billion kilowatt-hours.

    社会主义国家重工业迅速增长
    本报讯　社会主义各国现在一年内生产多少吨钢铁，多少吨煤和多少瓩时的电力？它们的重工业生产的发展具有怎样的规模？最近一期苏联“国际生活”杂志上发表的苏联中央经济关系局副局长查哈罗夫写的一篇文章，对这个大家都关心的问题作了概括的描述。
    文章说，在1955年，社会主义各国总共开采了约八亿八千万吨煤，生产了四千六百多万吨生铁，约六千二百万吨钢，以及约二千六百亿瓩时的电力。现在社会主义各国正在顺利执行着进一步发展国民经济的宏伟计划，在今后的五年内，这些国家的重工业产量将大大增长。据作者估计，到1960年时，社会主义各国的重工业产量将达到：煤——约十二亿五千万吨，生铁——约六千二百万吨，钢——约九千五百万吨，电力——约四千七百亿瓩时。
