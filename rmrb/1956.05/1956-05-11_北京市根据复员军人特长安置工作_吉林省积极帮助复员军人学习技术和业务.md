Xinhua News Agency Report:

    In the office of the Beijing Municipal Demobilized Servicemen Placement Committee, many staff members from agencies and factories come every day to discuss absorbing demobilized soldiers to participate in the work of their units. From the beginning of March to now, more than one thousand demobilized soldiers assigned to Beijing Municipality have been placed. Most of them were placed within a week.
    When assigning work, the units took into account the skills and expertise of the demobilized soldiers. After the 120 demobilized soldiers assigned to the Beijing Post Office reported for duty, the Post Office first introduced them to the work of the Post Office, and then assigned them work according to their conditions, which the demobilized soldiers were very satisfied with. A group of demobilized soldiers who used to be car drivers are now assigned to the Beijing Municipal Automobile Transportation Company to undertake transportation work at construction sites. Demobilized soldiers, tank drivers Zhang Lianqin and Wang Shucheng, etc., are now tractor drivers.

Xinhua News Agency Report:

    More than 97% of the demobilized construction soldiers in Jilin Province have been settled. At present, governments at all levels are actively preparing to settle the demobilized construction soldiers who are arriving successively and the small number who have not yet been settled.
    Many departments are also earnestly helping demobilized soldiers to master technology and become familiar with business.
    Since early April, the leading departments of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture have held industrial accounting training classes in Wangqing, Yanji and other places respectively, so that a group of revolutionary disabled soldiers and demobilized construction soldiers have learned certain skills and obtained the opportunity to participate in the work of industrial and mining enterprises. The Changchun Instrument Museum of the Chinese Academy of Sciences assigned special personnel to the demobilized soldiers to help them make up for scientific knowledge and guide their operation skills by teaching them as apprentices, so that they became familiar with the business in only half a year. The Changchun Equipment Factory of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications also specially held apprentice technical training classes for a group of demobilized soldiers. After they participated in production, most of them became excellent skilled workers.

    北京市根据复员军人特长安置工作
    吉林省积极帮助复员军人学习技术和业务
    在北京市转业建设委员会的办公室里，每天都有许多机关、工厂的工作人员前来接洽吸收复员军人参加他们本单位的工作。从三月初到现在，分配到北京市的一千多名复员军人都已经进行了安置。其中大部分在一个星期内就安置完毕。
    各单位在分配工作的时候照顾了复员军人的技术和特长。分配到北京邮局的一百二十名复员军人到职后，邮局首先向他们介绍了邮局的工作情况，然后根据各人的条件分别分配他们工作，复员军人都很满意。一批原来做汽车司机的复员军人，现在都被分配到北京市汽车运输公司担负建筑工地的运输工作。复员军人、坦克手张连钦和王树成等，现在做了拖拉机手。  （据新华社讯）
    吉林省97％以上的复员建设军人都得到了安置。目前各级人民政府正在积极准备安置陆续到来的和少数尚未安置的复员建设军人。
    许多部门还切实地帮助复员军人掌握技术，熟悉业务。
    延边朝鲜族自治州领导部门从四月上旬起已经在汪清、延吉等地分别举办了工业会计训练班，使一批革命残废军人和复员建设军人学到了一定的技术，获得了参加工矿企业工作的机会。长春中国科学院仪器馆对复员军人都指定专人负责以带徒弟的方法为他们补习科学知识，指导操作技术，使他们只用了半年的时间便熟悉了业务。邮电部长春器材厂也专门为一批复员军人举办了徒工技术训练班，他们参加生产后多数都成了优秀的技术工人。
