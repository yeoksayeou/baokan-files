Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 15th. According to a report by the German News Agency: Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, pointed out the tasks facing the working class and peace-loving forces in West Germany in an interview with a German News Agency reporter.

    He said that preventing the outbreak of war in Europe largely depends on the working class and peace forces in West Germany. That is to say, the working class throughout Germany must unite against their common enemy—German militarism, and all peace-loving German people must support disarmament. Suppressing German militarism and implementing disarmament are prerequisites for German reunification.

    Ulbricht called on the people of West Germany to prepare to defeat Adenauer's party in the West German elections next year in order to create conditions for the reunification of Germany. He said that the peace-loving forces in West Germany are sufficient to establish a parliament and government that will support disarmament and reach an understanding with the German Democratic Republic on issues such as the number of police and troops and armaments in Germany, the prohibition of storing atomic weapons within Germany, and the withdrawal of all foreign troops.

    Ulbricht said that if, in the West German elections, the majority of the people are determined to oppose the policies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Adenauer's foreign policy, and demonstrate their determination to strive for peace, democracy, unity, and progress, then the possibility of guaranteeing peace and reunifying Germany into a peaceful and democratic country will arise. That would be a decisive contribution to maintaining peace in Europe.

    乌布利希谈西德人民面临的任务
    在明年选举中击败阿登纳的党，为统一德国创造条件
    新华社柏林15日电　据德意志通讯社报道：德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希在对德意志通讯社记者发表的谈话中指出了西德工人阶级和和平力量所面临的任务。
    他说，要防止欧洲爆发战争在很大程度上取决于西德的工人阶级和和平力量。这就是说，全德国的工人阶级必须团结一致来反对他们的共同敌人——德国军国主义，一切爱好和平的德国人民必须支持裁军。压制德国军国主义和实行裁军是德国重新统一的先决条件。
    乌布利希号召西德人民准备在明年举行的西德选举中击败阿登纳的党，以便为德国的重新统一创造条件。他说，西德爱好和平的力量足以建立一个这样的议会和政府：它们将支持裁军和就德国警察和军队的人数和军备、禁止在德国境内储放原子武器和撤退一切外国军队等问题同德意志民主共和国达成谅解。
    乌布利希说，如果在西德选举中，大多数人民决心反对北大西洋公约组织的政策和阿登纳的外交政策，并且表明他们的争取和平、民主、统一和进步的决心，那么就会出现保证和平和把德国重新统一成为爱好和平的和民主的国家的可能性。那将是对维护欧洲和平的一个决定性的贡献。
