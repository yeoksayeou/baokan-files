Xinhua News Agency, Aden, 16th: Political leaders in the British colony of Aden, located in the southeastern part of the Arabian Peninsula, submitted a request to Britain on May 15th for autonomy and internal independence within the Commonwealth.

The request was made by a delegation from the Aden Legislative Council during a meeting with Mr. Lloyd, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies. They demanded that ministers of various departments be elected by the Legislative Council; that municipal councils have full power to elect their own speakers; that Arabic be recognized as an official language, so that a wider range of Arabs can participate in the government; that the number of local Adenese officials be increased, and the number of British officials holding senior positions be reduced. They also requested to organize their own national army.

    亚丁立法议会向英国要求自治和内政独立
    新华社16日讯　亚丁消息：在阿拉伯半岛东南部的英国属地亚丁的政治领袖们五月十五日向英国提出了要在英联邦以内实行自治和内政独立的要求。
    这个要求是亚丁立法议会的一个代表团在同英国殖民部驻议会次官劳埃德举行会议时向他提出的。他们要求由立法议会选举各部部长；各市议会有充分的权力来选举它们自己的议长；承认阿拉伯语是官方语言，以便使更广泛的阿拉伯人可以参加政府；增加亚丁当地人官员的数额，减少担任高级职务的英籍官员的数额。他们还要求组织它自己的国民军。
