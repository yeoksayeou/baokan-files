Scientific Research Results on Using Bamboo to Replace Steel and Wood

At the first scientific discussion meeting of Tongji University, ten teachers announced the results of their research on using bamboo to replace steel and wood.

One of the research projects—bamboo-reinforced concrete slabs—has been adopted by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Construction Engineering and will be promoted for the construction of small-span workshops and civil buildings in Shanghai.

A professor from the Soil Mechanics Teaching and Research Group reported the test results of this type of concrete slab at the discussion meeting. He said that when this type of slab was destroyed by a heavy load of 1,700 to 2,500 kilograms, the bamboo reinforcement did not break; the rigidity of this slab was also qualified after a load of 400 to 500 kilograms was applied at a span of two meters.

The preliminary results of the research on the denaturation and hardening of bamboo carried out by the Building Materials Teaching and Research Group in cooperation with the Shanghai Railway Administration show that: after heating and neutralizing the bamboo, and then compression molding it into a whole, the water absorption of this denatured bamboo is much smaller than that of the original bamboo, and fillers can be added to adjust its hardness. This research provides a broad path for the large-scale and multi-faceted utilization of bamboo in construction engineering.

Other teaching and research groups have conducted research on the anti-corrosion, fire prevention and waterproof treatment of bamboo, analysis of its mechanical properties, and the manufacture and application of bamboo buildings.

　　利用竹材代替钢材和木材的科学研究成果
    在同济大学第一次科学讨论会上，十位教师分别宣读了利用竹材代替钢材和木材的研究结果。
    其中一项研究——竹筋混凝土板已经被上海市建筑工程局采用，决定在上海建造的小跨距工房和民用建筑上推广。
    土工教研组的教授在讨论会上报告了这种混凝土板的试验结果。他说，当这种板因受到一千七百到二千五百公斤的重压而破坏时，竹筋还没有拉断；这种板在跨度两公尺的地方荷载四、五百公斤以后，刚度也合格。
    建筑材料教研组同上海铁路管理局合作研究竹材变性和硬化的初步结果表明：把竹材加热中和，再压塑成为整体，这种变性竹材的吸水性比原竹材小得多，而且能够加入填料来调节它的硬度。这一研究给建筑工程大量地多方面地利用竹材提供了广阔的途径。
    其他教研组对竹材的防腐、防火和防水处理，力学性能分析以及竹材建筑制造和应用等方面进行了研究。
