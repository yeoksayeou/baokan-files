Build the Motherland into a Prosperous and Strong Socialist Industrial Power
A Letter to All Workers in the Country from All Representatives of the National Advanced Producers Conference

Dear fellow workers, both men and women, across the country:

We are representatives of advanced producers from all over the motherland. At the National Advanced Producers Conference, we heard the instructions of the Party Central Committee, the speeches of responsible comrades from the State Council and people's organizations, and the report of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. We also reported on our work to the motherland. Now, our meeting is about to conclude. Filled with ardent desires to build socialism and boundless confidence, we are about to return to our original posts.

During these unforgettable days, we have deeply realized how glorious and fortunate it is to live in such a great era! Because today, as our beloved leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "We are doing a most glorious and great cause that our predecessors have never done," and are creating a happy life for our descendants for generations to come; the achievements of each of our labor and work have received full attention and care from the Party and the state, and labor has become the most glorious thing in our country!

We know that our country is currently in a new historical period. The current historical task of the people of the whole country, especially our working class, is to build our country into a fully modernized, prosperous and strong socialist industrial power in a not too long period of time. This requires not only that we complete and over fulfill the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy in industry, agriculture, capital construction, transportation, commerce, science, culture, education, and health, but also requires us to complete our socialist construction cause in our country more, faster, better and more economically. The completion of this historical task will greatly change the face of the motherland. Thousands upon thousands of new factories and mines will be built; many new cities will appear throughout the motherland; our transportation will be accessible in all directions, and new railways and highways will lead directly from the capital to all border areas; the Yellow River, which has plagued the people for thousands of years, will be transformed by our hands into a river that benefits the people, and the world's largest hydroelectric power station will be built on the Yangtze River; our own manufactured tractors will be driven on the vast fields of the motherland; our own manufactured automobiles and trains will run on the roads and railways of the motherland; our own manufactured airplanes will soar in the sky of the motherland; our inland rivers and oceans will also have ships of our own manufacture navigating. The deserts of our country will become fertile land, dense forests will grow on barren mountains, and the rich treasures underground in the motherland will exert their power. Our scientific and technological level will also strive to catch up with the world's advanced level in a not too long period of time. We will forever get rid of poverty and backwardness, make the beautiful mountains and rivers of the motherland more beautiful, and make the people's lives happier. The happy life that our ancestors have longed for, and the ideal of building socialism for which many martyrs shed their blood and sacrificed themselves, will be realized by our generation.

In order to complete this great historical task, first of all, we need all the workers in the country, whether in industry, agriculture, capital construction, transportation, commerce, or science, culture, education, health, and state organs, or whatever type of work they are engaged in—workers, engineering and technical personnel, staff, scientific researchers, medical personnel, teachers, drivers, salespeople, accountants, typists, nannies, cooks...all consciously regard building socialism as their own personal cause, and give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity with the attitude of masters in various different work posts. Every type of labor is necessary for the cause of socialist construction and is glorious. We must rely on the collective wisdom and collective strength in various different work posts, and continuously push forward the cause of socialist construction with the spirit of bold innovation. This labor enthusiasm and creativity is the inexhaustible source of strength for building socialism, and it is also the primary guarantee for us to realize socialism in our country. Therefore, all those who stand on different posts of socialist construction should work conscientiously and thriftily in accordance with the instructions of the Party, and dedicate all their wisdom to the great cause of socialist construction!

In order to complete this great historical task, we also need to quickly eliminate our country's backwardness in culture and science, and march towards culture and science. To this end, we must strive to improve our cultural level, strive to improve technology, improve technology, learn and master new technologies, so as to improve our country's technical level, so as to achieve technical transformation in our country's various economic sectors in a planned and step-by-step manner. Every one of our workers should pay attention to mastering and utilizing the world's latest scientific and technological achievements in their work, learn from the advanced scientific and technological experience of various countries, and pay special attention to promoting the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries as well as our own country; learn to use new technical equipment, and be familiar with new operating methods; at the same time, pay attention to bringing into play the power of old equipment and tapping the potential of existing enterprises; so as to strive to make our country's industrial and technical level reach the height that an advanced industrial country should have in a not too long period of time.

In order to complete this great historical task of building socialism, we must also continue to wage unremitting struggle against all right-leaning conservative ideas and bureaucratic phenomena. We know that in the process of socialist construction, there will always be a struggle between the new and the old, the advanced and the backward, and positive factors and negative factors. Bureaucratic phenomena and right-leaning conservative ideas will always be obstacles to our progress. In order to eliminate this obstacle, help the newly born advanced things grow smoothly, and make our cause advance rapidly, we must continue to struggle bravely against all right-leaning conservative ideas and bureaucratic phenomena with the attitude of masters and the spirit of being responsible to the country.

Comrades, our country's socialist construction cause has just begun, so although we have overcome countless difficulties in various aspects in the past few years and created brilliant achievements, this is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand miles. In this earth-shattering socialist construction cause, we will certainly encounter many difficulties, so we need workers, peasants, and intellectuals across the country to unite more closely under the leadership of the Party, cooperate closely, give full play to the spirit of hard work and unyielding, and use the great spirit of making high mountains bow and making rivers give way to overcome all difficulties. We have the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the solid alliance of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, the assistance of our great ally—the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, the shining of the invincible Marxism-Leninism, friends all over the world, and hundreds of millions of hearts loyal to the motherland, so we will certainly be able to overcome all difficulties, and no force can stop the firm will of the 600 million people of our country to build socialism!

Comrades, here, labor is for ourselves and our country. The more and better we labor, the stronger our country will be and the richer our lives will be. For the prosperity and strength of our beloved motherland and for our happy lives, we are willing to work with workers across the country under the guidance of the principles of mutual learning, mutual assistance, learning from each other's strengths, and improving together to carry out the advanced producer movement more widely. We hope that everyone will strive to be an advanced producer. Each of us must do our work more, faster, better and more economically on the basis of good and economical, and greet the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China with practical actions to complete and overfulfill the first five-year plan ahead of schedule! We, the representatives of these advanced producers, guarantee to the workers across the country: We will always cherish the honor given to us by the Party and the state, work hard to learn, never be proud, and advance further and further on the glorious road of socialism with the workers across the country!

Long live our great motherland!

Long live the Communist Party of China, which leads us to advance forever!

All Representatives of the National Advanced Producers Conference

    把祖国建设成为富强的社会主义工业大国
    全国先进生产者代表会议全体代表给全国职工的一封信亲爱的全国男女职工同志们：
    我们是来自祖国各地的先进生产者代表。在全国先进生产者代表会议上，我们听到了党中央的指示，听到了国务院和人民团体的许多负责同志的讲话，听到了中华全国总工会的报告，并向祖国汇报了自己的工作。现在，我们的会议就要结束了。我们满怀着建设社会主义的热烈愿望和无比的信心即将回到原来的工作岗位上去。
    在这些令人难忘的日子里，我们深深地体会到生活在今天这样一个伟大的时代是何等的光荣和幸福！因为在今天，正像我们敬爱的领袖毛主席所指出的：“我们正在做我们的前人从来没有做过的极其光荣伟大的事业”，正在为我们子孙万代缔造幸福的生活；我们每一个人的劳动和工作成就，都受到了党和国家充分的重视和关怀，劳动在我国已经成为最光荣的事情！
    我们知道：目前我国正处在一个新的历史时期，全国人民、首先是我们工人阶级当前的历史任务，就是要在不太长的时间内，把我国建设成为一个完全现代化的、富强的社会主义工业大国。这就不仅要求我们在工业、农业、基本建设、交通运输、商业和科学、文化、教育、卫生各个方面，提前完成和超额完成发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，而且还要求我们又多又快又好又省地完成我国的社会主义建设事业。这个历史任务的完成，将大大地改变祖国的面貌。成千上万的新的工厂和矿山将建设起来；许多新的城市将在祖国各地出现；我国的交通将四通八达，新的铁路和公路将从首都直通到各个边疆；几千年来祸害人民的黄河，将在我们手中变成一条为人民造福的河流，在长江上也将建立起世界上规模最大的水力发电站；我们自己制造的拖拉机将开动在祖国广阔的田野上；在祖国的公路和铁路上将奔驰着我们自己制造的汽车和火车；我们自己制造的飞机将翱翔在祖国上空；我们的内河和海洋也将有自己制造的轮船航行。我国的沙漠将变成沃土，荒山上将生长起密茂的森林，祖国地下丰富的宝藏将发挥出它的力量。我国的科学技术水平也将努力在不太长的时间内赶上世界先进水平。我们将永远摆脱贫困和落后，使祖国的锦绣河山更加美丽，人民的生活更加幸福。我们祖祖辈辈渴望的幸福生活，多少先烈为之流血牺牲的建设社会主义的理想，将要在我们这一代把它实现。
    为了完成这个伟大的历史任务，首先需要我们全国职工，无论是工业、农业、基本建设、交通运输、商业，或是科学、文化、教育、卫生、国家机关工作者，也无论是从事哪一种职业的工作人员，——工人、工程技术人员、职员、科学研究人员、医务人员、教师、驾驶员、售货员、会计员、打字员、保育员、炊事员……都自觉地把建设社会主义当做自己的切身事业，在各种不同的工作岗位上，以主人翁的态度，充分发挥自己的积极性和创造性。无论哪一种劳动都是社会主义建设事业所必需的，都是光荣的。我们要在各种不同的工作岗位上依靠集体的智慧和集体的力量，以大胆革新的精神不断地把社会主义建设事业推向前进。这种劳动积极性和创造性，就是建设社会主义力量的无尽的源泉，也就是我们使社会主义在我国实现的首要保证。因此，所有站在社会主义建设不同岗位上的人们都应该按照党的指示，兢兢业业、克勤克俭地工作，把自己的全部智慧献给伟大的社会主义建设事业！
    为了完成这个伟大的历史任务，还需要我们迅速消除我国在文化和科学方面的落后现象，向文化和科学进军。为此，我们必须努力提高文化水平，努力提高技术、改进技术、学习与掌握新技术，来提高我国的技术水平，以便有计划、有步骤地在我国的各个经济部门实现技术改造。我们每一个职工在自己的工作中，都应该注意掌握和利用世界上最新的科学技术成就，学习各国的先进科学技术经验，特别要注意推广苏联和各人民民主国家以及我国自己的先进经验；学习使用新的技术设备，熟悉新的操作方法；同时注意发挥旧设备的力量，挖掘现有企业的潜力；以便争取在不太长的时间内，使我国的工业技术水平达到一个先进的工业国家应有的高度。
    为了完成建设社会主义这个伟大的历史任务，我们还必须向一切右倾保守思想和官僚主义现象继续进行不懈的斗争。我们知道：在社会主义建设过程中，将永远充满着新的与旧的、先进的与落后的、积极因素与消极因素的斗争。官僚主义现象和右倾保守思想，将永远是我们前进的障碍。为了消除这个障碍，帮助新生的先进的事物顺利成长，使我们的事业迅速前进，我们必须以主人翁的态度和对国家负责的精神，勇敢地向一切右倾保守思想和官僚主义现象继续斗争。
    同志们，我国的社会主义建设事业刚刚开始，所以，尽管我们几年来在各个方面克服了无数的困难，创造了辉煌的业绩，但这只不过是万里长征的第一步。我们在这个惊天动地的社会主义建设事业中，将一定还会遇到不少的困难，因此，也就需要我们全国工人、农民和知识分子在党的领导下，更加团结，密切合作，充分发扬艰苦奋斗、不屈不挠的精神，用使高山低头，使河水让路的伟大气魄，来战胜一切困难。我们有党和毛主席的英明领导，有巩固的工人农民和知识分子的联盟，有伟大的盟邦——苏联和各兄弟国家的援助，有战无不胜的马克思列宁主义光芒的照耀，有遍布全世界的朋友，我们还有亿万颗忠于祖国的赤诚的心，因而我们将一定能克服一切困难，任何力量都阻挡不住我国六亿人民建设社会主义的坚强意志！
    同志们，在我们这里，劳动是为了我们自己和我们的国家，劳动得越多、越好，我们的国家也就越加强大，我们的生活也就越加富裕。为了我们亲爱的祖国的繁荣昌盛，为了我们的幸福生活，我们愿意和全国职工一道在互相学习、互相帮助、取长补短、共同提高的原则指导下，把先进生产者运动更广泛地开展起来。我们希望人人都争取做一个先进生产者。我们每一个人都要在又好、又省的基础上把工作做得又多、又快，以提前完成和超额完成第一个五年计划的实际行动，来迎接中国共产党第八次全国代表大会！我们这些先进生产者代表向全国职工同志们保证：我们一定永远珍视党和国家给我们的光荣，努力学习、绝不骄傲，和全国职工同志们一道在社会主义的光辉道路上前进再前进！
    我们伟大的祖国万岁！
    领导我们永远前进的中国共产党万岁！
  全国先进生产者代表会议全体代表
          1956年5月10日
