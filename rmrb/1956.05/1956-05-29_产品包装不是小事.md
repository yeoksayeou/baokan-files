    Product Packaging is Not a Minor Matter
    Kong Sang
    In industrial production, the following things have happened: The enamel basins produced by the state-owned Wuhan 212 Factory were of good design and quality, but they were packed into boxes, one inside the other, while the paint was still wet. When the commercial department opened the boxes, the nested basins were stuck together and could not be separated no matter what. In January of this year, the local state-owned Changchun Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory had 4,790 bottles of sugar-containing pepsin returned because the bottle stoppers were bad, causing the medicine to become damp and caked, thus spoiling. Hubei Paper Mill, Xuanhua Paper Mill, Liaoning Tieling Paper Mill, and Tianjin Public-Private Joint Venture Fuyuan Paper Mill have all had originally good paper turned into substandard products or waste products due to damp packaging wood, loose packaging, or careless nailing during packaging. These types of incidents are like walking ten thousand miles, only to break a leg just before reaching the destination, which is particularly heartbreaking.
    Boxing, bottling, and packaging products are the final processes in production. Compared to other processes, the technology is relatively simple. But the problem lies in the simplicity of the technology. Because people treat technologically complex processes as critical to production. Factory directors, workshop directors, engineering and technical personnel care about it, production workers are careful, and quality inspectors are particularly conscientious. In this way, even if problems occur, they can be discovered and corrected in time. Packaging processes are different. Some workers think the technology is simple, so they are not as careful when working. Leaders also believe that packaging is not a major part of production, and they have not provided the necessary education for packaging workers. Some do not even care whether the packaging workers understand the business. For example, the local state-owned Northwest Pharmaceutical Factory has repeatedly put the wrong labels on medicines in the past two years: putting the label for menstrual regulating pills on cough tablets, and putting the label for isoniazid, a drug for lung disease, on quinine urethane, a drug for malaria. The reason for this is that the workers who put on the labels did not understand the business.
    In terms of the complexity of the technology, packaging work is indeed not a major part of production. However, in terms of the losses caused by accidents, packaging processes are particularly worthy of attention. Because what is being packaged are finished products, the crystallization of the labor of hundreds or thousands of workers. Poor packaging or mistakes in packaging is like burying the labor of hundreds or thousands of workers, turning good things into bad things, and turning good products into substandard products. Some products, such as medicines, are originally for treating diseases and saving lives. If the packaging is not good, the medicine deteriorates, or the label is put on wrong, it may help the disease and harm people! There is an old Chinese saying: "Failure is often just one step away from success," meaning that when a task is about to succeed, failure to make the final effort results in the abandonment of all previous efforts. Our industrial production should pay attention to ensuring and improving product quality from beginning to end, and prevent the phenomenon of "failure is often just one step away from success."

    产品包装不是小事
    孔桑
    在工业生产中，曾经发生过这样一些事情：国营武汉二一二工厂生产的脸盆，式样和质量都算不错，可是，在油漆未干的时候，就一个套一个地装箱了；商业部门打开箱子一看，成套的脸盆粘住了，无论怎样也拉不开。地方国营长春化学制药厂，今年一月有4，790瓶出厂的含糖胃蛋白酶被退回来了，原因是药瓶的木塞不好，药品受潮结块——变质了。湖北纸厂、宣化纸厂、辽宁铁岭造纸厂、天津公私合营富源造纸厂等单位，也都因为包装的木板潮湿，或者包装太松，或者包装的时候钉钉不小心，使本来很好的纸张变成次品或废品。这一类的事故好比走万里路，在快要到达目的地的时候却摔断腿一样，特别令人痛心。
    产品的装箱、装瓶和打包裹，是生产的最后工序。比起别的工序来，它的技术还是比较简单的。但是问题也就发生在技术简单上。因为技术复杂的工序，人人都把它当做生产关键来对待，厂长、车间主任、工程技术人员关心它，生产工人也细心，质量检验人员也特别认真。这样，即使发生了问题也能及时发现，及时纠正。对包装工序可不一样。有些工人认为技术简单，干起活来就不那末细心。领导人员也认为包装不是生产的主要环节，没对包装工人进行必要的教育，有的甚至连包装工人是不是懂得业务也不管。例如地方国营西北制药厂，去年和前年，曾经好几次贴错药品标签：在止咳片上贴上调经片的药签，在治疟疾的奎宁乌拉坦上贴上治肺病的异烟肼，其原因就是贴标签的工人不懂业务。
    从技术的复杂程度来说，包装工作的确不算生产中的主要环节。但是，从发生事故所造成的损失来看，包装工序是特别值得重视的。因为包装的都是成品，是成百成千工人的劳动结晶。包装得不好或者发生了错误，就是葬送成百成千工人的劳动，就是把本来是好的东西变为坏的东西，把好产品变为次品。有些产品，如医药，本来是治病救人的，要是包装不好，药品变质，或者把标签贴错了，就有可能助病害人！我国有一句古话：“功亏一篑”，意思是说，在事情快要成功的时候，没有作最后努力，结果前功尽弃。我们的工业生产应该自始至终都注意保证和提高产品质量，防止“功亏一篑”的现象。
