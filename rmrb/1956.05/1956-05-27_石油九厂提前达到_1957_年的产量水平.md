    Petroleum Plant No. 9 Achieves 1957 Production Level Ahead of Schedule
    To the Editor:
    State-owned Petroleum Plant No. 9 has reached the 1957 crude oil production level one year and nine months ahead of schedule.
    In March of this year, Petroleum Plant No. 9 launched a socialist labor competition. The enthusiasm of the workers was high, and the employees of the oil refining production workshops, auxiliary workshops, various departments, and transportation departments all participated in the advanced producer movement. In March, the workers put forward more than 460 rationalization proposals. Many technicians took the initiative to go deep into the workshops and teams to help workers summarize production experience and further promote more than ten advanced experiences such as "quantitative furnace door loading," "ten minutes for pipe removal, forty minutes for pipe installation," and "water spraying metering." The motorcade achieved a record of 172,000 kilometers of safe operation, and driver Wu Xianting created a record of 100,000 kilometers without major repairs. In the labor competition, 274 advanced producers emerged. All employees of the Second Workshop also proposed that by June, half of the workers in the entire workshop should become advanced producers. Based on the weak links in production that emerged during the labor competition, the factory leadership adopted important measures such as "increasing exhaust capacity," "pile bottom engineering" for heap dry distillation, and "locomotive double traction," which solved key problems such as low processing capacity, low oil extraction efficiency, and accumulation of furnace slag. As a result, crude oil production had already exceeded the 1957 level by 0.8% by April 15th. The amount of shale consumed per ton of crude oil was reduced to 16.2 tons (the planned figure for 1957 was 20.5 tons), and the product quality also exceeded the 1957 targets.
    Currently, all employees of Petroleum Plant No. 9 are further improving production, working hard to consolidate the achievements already made and strive to comprehensively overfulfill the first Five-Year Plan.

### 石油九厂提前达到1957年的产量水平

    石油九厂提前达到1957年的产量水平
    编辑同志：
    国营石油九厂已经提前一年零九个月达到了1957年的原油产量水平。
    今年三月份，石油九厂展开了社会主义劳动竞赛。职工们劳动热情高涨，炼油生产车间、辅助车间、各科室和运输部门的职工都投入了先进生产者运动。在三月份里，职工们提出了四百六十多件合理化建议。很多技术人员主动地深入到各车间和班组去，帮助工人总结生产经验，并且进一步推广了“炉门定量”、“十分钟掏管、四十分钟装管”、“喷水计量”等十多种先进经验。汽车队出现了十七万二千公里安全运行的事迹，司机吴显亭创造了十万公里无大修的纪录。在劳动竞赛中，涌现出274名先进生产者。第二车间全体职工还提出，到六月份要使全车间有一半的工人成为先进生产者。工厂领导方面根据劳动竞赛中出现的生产上的薄弱环节，采取了“加大排风能力”、成堆干馏的“堆底工程”、“机车双牵引”等重要措施，解决了处理量低、采油效率不高、炉渣积压等关键问题。这样，到四月十五日原油产量就已经超过1957年的水平0.8％。每吨原油消耗页岩量降低到十六点二吨（1957年的计划数字是二十吨半），产品质量也超过了1957年的指标。
    现在，石油九厂的全体职工，正在进一步搞好生产，为巩固已经取得的成绩和争取全面超额完成第一个五年计划而努力。
