    Transporting Goods with Containers
    Water-land combined transport of goods using containers has begun between Shanghai and Shenyang. The first batch of containers, transported by rail from Shenyang to Dalian, was transshipped to Shanghai by ship on the 22nd.

    A container is a specially made large iron box. Ten boxes can be loaded onto one railway car. Using these boxes to transport goods makes loading, unloading, and handover very convenient. Transporting goods in boxes can also save packaging costs and reduces damage. This method of transporting goods is very popular in the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries. China also began using it on some railway lines last year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    用集装箱运输货物
    上海、沈阳间开始用集装箱水陆联运货物，第一批由沈阳经铁路运到大连的集装箱，二十二日已经由轮船转运到上海。
    集装箱是一种特制的大铁箱子。十只箱子装一个火车皮。用这种箱子运货，装卸和交接都很方便。货物装在箱子里运送，还可以节省包装费用，又不易损坏。用这个方法运输货物，在苏联和其他人民民主国家很流行，中国去年也开始在部分铁路线上使用。　（新华社）
