Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 26th: Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama said on the 25th that Japan is "very willing to normalize relations with the Soviet Union and Communist China." However, he went on to explain that, with regard to China, because Japan still has relations with the Chiang Kai-shek group, "we want to strengthen economic cooperation and gradually seek normalization."

Hatoyama expressed this attitude in response to questions from members of the Diet in the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee.

At the same time, Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu told the committee that the Japanese government intends to try to establish "closer relations" with China, within practically feasible limits, through trade and other methods. He said that the existence of China could not be denied, "it has become a great power on the Asian continent."

Shigemitsu also said that Japan, considering its international position, must gradually deal with the China issue from now on.

Hatoyama Ichiro also stated at the Foreign Affairs Committee that Japan "has absolutely no intention of regarding communist countries as enemies. Japan must pursue a policy of world peace, which is the primary principle of Japan's foreign policy." He said that he "did not anticipate in advance" the "meeting of diplomatic elders" held on May 24. He stated that "the government's beliefs will not be changed by such a meeting." It is reported that at that meeting, a group of people led by former Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida demanded that Shigemitsu insist on the "return of territory" in the negotiations with the Soviet Union.

Hatoyama also said, "I don't think (Japan) is in a dependent relationship with the United States at all." He announced, "Therefore, the (Japanese) government does not intend to participate in organizations like the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

Hatoyama also believed that "for world peace, (Japan) needs to maintain friendly relations with the United States."

Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The Japanese public has been very concerned about the development of Japan's relations with the Soviet Union these days. Today, Agriculture and Forestry Minister Ichiro Kono returned to Tokyo. As many as 10,000 people welcomed him at Haneda Airport, celebrating his successful signing of the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty.

Secretary-General Inejiro Asanuma of the Socialist Party issued a statement today saying that Ichiro Kono's signing of the Fisheries Treaty in Moscow was a move that opened the way for the restoration of Japan-Soviet diplomatic relations. The Socialist Party demands the early restoration of Japan-Soviet diplomatic relations.

Asanuma also pointed out that Kono should have returned to Japan immediately after the negotiations in Moscow to report to the Diet, but instead he traveled to the United States to hold talks with Dulles, which is incomprehensible. At a press conference at Haneda Airport today, Kono said that he could not disclose the content of his talks with Dulles.

The turning point in Japan-Soviet relations has been met with hostility by some forces within the Japanese ruling group. According to Kyodo News, the Foreign Affairs Investigation Committee of the Liberal Democratic Party, chaired by Ashida Hitoshi, invited Foreign Minister Shigemitsu and former Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru, former Foreign Minister Okazaki Katsuo, former Ambassador to Taiwan Yoshizawa Kenkichi, and other "diplomatic elders" on the 24th to hold a symposium to discuss the Japan-Soviet negotiations. People from the faction advocating "careful restoration of Japan-Soviet diplomatic relations" led by Yoshida emphasized at the meeting that the territorial issue should be "insisted on to the end" in the negotiations. Sources say that the behind-the-scenes motive of this meeting was to encourage Shigemitsu to advance according to his "gradual" policy in order to suppress the government's actions to quickly restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.

After the meeting, Shigemitsu said that he was "encouraged" to hear Yoshida's opinions. On the same day, Shigemitsu also emphasized at the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee that "the demand for the return of the southern part of the Kuril Islands is a legitimate demand." According to Kyodo News, if Shigemitsu does not withdraw his claim in the future, it will be difficult to avoid confrontation with the faction advocating early restoration of diplomatic relations, which will have a great impact on the unity of the Liberal Democratic Party and the unification of opinions within the government.

    日本首相表示愿使日中和日苏关系正常化
    日本一部分势力竭力想阻挠日苏关系好转
    新华社26日讯　东京消息：日本首相鸠山一郎二十五日说，日本“非常愿意使同苏联、共产党中国之间的邦交正常化。”但是，他接着说明，对于中国，因为日本还有同蒋介石集团的关系，“所以想使经济上的合作紧密起来，慢慢地谋求正常化。”
    鸠山是在众议院外务委员会上答复国会议员的质询时表示这种态度的。
    同时，外务相重光葵在这个委员会上说，日本政府打算在实际可行的范围内，通过贸易和其他方法设法同中国建立“更加密切的关系”。他说，无法否认中国的存在，“它已经成为亚洲大陆上的一个大国”。
    重光又说，日本考虑到自己所处的国际地位，必须从现在起逐步处理关于中国的问题。
    鸠山一郎在外务委员会上还谈到，日本“完全没有把共产党国家看成敌人的意思。日本必须推行世界和平政策，这是日本外交政策上的首要方针”。他说，对于五月二十四日举行的“外交元老会议”，他“事前没有预料到”。他表示，“不会因为这样的会议而改变政府的信念”。据报道，在那次会议上，以前首相吉田茂为主的一批人要求重光葵在对苏谈判中坚持“归还领土”。
    鸠山又说，“我一点也不认为（日本）对美国处于依附的关系”。他宣布，“因此，（日本）政府不打算参加像东南亚条约组织这样的组织。”
    鸠山同时也认为，“为了世界和平，（日本）需要同美国保持亲善关系。”
    据新华社26日讯　日本公众这几天十分关心日本同苏联关系的发展。今天，农林相河野一郎回到东京。在羽田机场欢迎他的人多达一万名左右，人们欢迎他成功地签订了日苏渔业条约。
    社会党总书记浅沼稻次郎今天发表谈话说，河野一郎在莫斯科签订渔业条约是开辟了恢复日苏邦交的道路的举动。社会党要求早日使日苏邦交恢复。
    浅沼也指出，河野在莫斯科谈判结束后应该立即回国，向国会提出报告，但是他却取道美国同杜勒斯举行了会谈，这是不能令人理解的。河野今天在羽田机场的记者招待会上表示，他不能透露同杜勒斯会谈的内容。
    日苏关系的转机，遭到日本统治集团内部一部分势力的仇视。据共同社报道，以芦田均为会长的自由民主党外交调查会在二十四日邀请外务相重光葵和前首相吉田茂、前外务相冈崎胜南、前驻台湾“大使”芳泽谦吉等“外交界元老”举行了座谈会，讨论日苏谈判问题。吉田等主张“慎重地恢复日苏邦交”的一派的人在会上强调要在谈判中把领土问题“坚持到底”。有消息说，这次会议的幕后动机是鼓励重光按照他的“缓进”政策前进，以压制政府要与苏联迅速恢复邦交的行动。
    会后，重光表示，他听到吉田的意见“受到鼓舞”。当天，重光还在众议院外务委员会上强调，“要求归还千岛群岛南部，是正当的主张”。据共同社透露，今后重光如果不收回他的这个主张，就很难避免和主张早日恢复邦交派对立，对于自由民主党的团结和政府内部意见的统一也将会发生很大的影响。
