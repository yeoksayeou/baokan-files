Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 21st. Prince Norodom Sihanouk, former Prime Minister of Cambodia, said on May 20th upon arriving in Calcutta en route to Paris that the Indochina International Supervisory Commission, headed by India, should remain in Indochina in order to maintain peace between bordering countries.

Speaking about the trade agreement signed between Cambodia and China in Beijing on April 24th, Sihanouk said that Cambodia had accepted the People's Republic of China's offer of economic assistance because it was needed to develop his country.

Sihanouk said that although Cambodia has established trade relations with China and friendly relations with some countries of the socialist camp, it continues to accept aid from Western countries. He believes that "this is undoubtedly an achievement of the policy of non-alignment."

    西哈努克和尼赫鲁讨论印度支那局势
    新华社新德里21日电　柬埔寨前首相西哈努克亲王今天上午同印度总理尼赫鲁举行了两个多小时的会谈。
    据西哈努克在会后告诉新闻记者说，他和尼赫鲁讨论了印度支那最近的局势和他当前对一些欧洲国家的友好访问。西哈努克将访问苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、西班牙和法国。
    西哈努克是在去法国的途中路过德里的。当天下午，西哈努克和他的随行人员已经离开德里前往喀喇蚩。
    据新华社新德里21日电　柬埔寨前首相西哈努克亲王五月二十日在赴巴黎途中到达加尔各答时说，以印度为首的印度支那国际委员会应当留在印度支那，以便保持互相接壤的国家之间的和平。
    西哈努克在谈到柬埔寨和中国四月二十四日在北京签订的贸易协定的时候说，柬埔寨已经接受了中华人民共和国提供经济援助的建议，因为这是发展他的国家所需要的。
    西哈努克说，虽然柬埔寨同中国建立了贸易关系，同某些社会主义阵营的国家建立了友好关系，但是它继续从西方各国接受援助。他认为“这无疑是不参加联盟的政策的成绩”。
