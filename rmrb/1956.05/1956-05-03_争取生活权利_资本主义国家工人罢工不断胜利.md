Striving for the Right to Live
　　Workers' Strikes in Capitalist Countries Continue to Succeed
　　Japanese Workers' Spring Struggle Movement Ends
    Tokyo Dispatch: The nationwide spring wage increase movement launched by Japanese workers in February has ended. The movement involved unions from government agencies, public corporations, and private enterprises, with a total of more than three million participants.
    Despite the Japanese government's active suppression of workers' demands, Japanese workers still held seven consecutive struggles as planned, forcing the capitalists to make concessions. According to Kyodo News, wages are estimated to have increased by an average of 6% to 7%.
    After the end of the spring wage increase movement, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan decided a few days ago to mobilize its more than three million members and call on other unions to launch a large-scale struggle to prevent the Diet from passing reactionary bills such as the implementation of the small constituency system, and to strive for victory in the House of Councillors election to be held this summer.
    Philippine Iron Mine Workers' Struggle Achieves Victory
