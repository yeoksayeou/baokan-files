　　The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance of the European eight countries composed of the Soviet Union and the European People's Democratic countries held a regular meeting recently and discussed the issue of mutual coordination in the long-term development of the national economy among the participating countries. Representatives of the People's Republic of China and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia also participated in the meeting as observers. The important decisions passed at this meeting mark the beginning of a new stage of economic cooperation among socialist countries. Its aim is to promote the common high tide of the national economy of the people's democratic countries.

　　Socialist countries, based on the socialist ownership of the means of production, have different levels of economic development, different resource strengths, production characteristics, and technological conditions. In order to restore the national economy destroyed by the war and seek common economic prosperity, these countries began to carry out economic cooperation on an equal and mutually beneficial basis in the initial years after the Second World War. This cooperation has effectively promoted the rapid development of the economies of various countries and played an important role in enhancing the economic strength of the entire socialist camp. However, during the past period, the economic cooperation among socialist countries was mainly limited to trade, mutual supply of raw materials and equipment, provision of credit assistance, and scientific and technological cooperation. At that time, each country formulated and implemented its own national economic plan separately, lacking prior mutual coordination. In order to enable the socialist economic forces to develop faster and greater and to accelerate technological progress, it is required to fully utilize all the untapped possibilities of economic cooperation among socialist countries, expand the scale of this cooperation, and raise it to a higher level. The experience accumulated by various countries in economic relations over the years and a better understanding of the production conditions and economic needs of each country have also provided favorable conditions for further developing economic cooperation among socialist countries.

　　The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance of the European eight countries was held under these circumstances. After more than a year of research and preparation, the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance of the eight countries has decided to carry out close coordination in the development of major heavy industrial sectors, light industry, and agriculture in the participating countries over the next five years (1956-1960).

　　Under the mutual coordination of long-term national economic plans, the interests of each country can be better combined with the economic interests of the entire socialist camp. When developing its economy, each country can not only use its own resources, but also anticipate assistance from brotherly countries in advance. That is to say, in a certain period, each country can clearly plan and foresee the prospects for its own economic development, and its product sales and raw material sources can be reliably guaranteed in advance. At the same time, the coordination of long-term plans creates prerequisites for the widespread implementation of production specialization and collaboration among socialist countries, so as to avoid unnecessary parallel and repetitive phenomena in industrial production in various countries, so as to concentrate efforts on developing those production sectors in which the country has the most favorable conditions.

　　When reviewing the development prospects of the machine manufacturing and optical instrument industries, the meeting formulated measures to expand the specialization of production in various countries and ensure further improvement of technology. As everyone knows, the machine manufacturing industry is the heart of heavy industry, and it plays the most important role in ensuring continuous technological innovation and the high tide of the entire national economy. However, the machine manufacturing industry is also an industrial sector that requires a large amount of investment. If the specialization of production is implemented and expanded on an international scale, some countries will be able to specialize in the production of certain basic types of machinery and equipment, and meet each other's needs through mutual exchange. This can not only save a lot of investment, but also make full use of the production potential of each country, shorten the production cycle of products, and create favorable conditions for the implementation of comprehensive mechanization and automation, thereby greatly improving labor productivity, reducing product costs, and increasing profits. The ultimate result is to promote the rapid development of the machine manufacturing industry and other economic sectors of the entire socialist camp.

　　With the development of the economies of socialist countries, the demand for industrial raw materials and fuels is also increasing. Therefore, ensuring the continuous expansion of the raw material and fuel base of various countries has become a very important matter. The meeting reviewed the issue of the development of the raw material base for the ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgical industries, and particularly emphasized the important role of economic cooperation among the participating countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance in ensuring that European people's democratic countries obtain hard coal produced in Poland and iron ore produced in the Soviet Union. At the same time, in order to meet the electricity needs in the economic development of the European People's Democratic countries, the meeting also adopted a work plan aimed at formulating recommendations on expanding electricity exchange among the participating countries, as well as joint development and utilization of the hydropower resources of the Danube River.

　　In addition to discussing the issue of mutual coordination of industry, the meeting also paid considerable attention to the long-term plan for agricultural development, especially the increase in agricultural production and the adjustment of supply. In order to ensure increased production, the meeting formulated important recommendations on vigorously expanding the mineral fertilizer industry and further developing agricultural machinery production, as well as mutual coordination in this regard.

　　Close coordination of long-term national economic development plans is a higher form of economic cooperation among socialist countries. It opens up unlimited prospects for fully exploiting the total resource strength and production potential of socialist countries, and it will enable the labor productivity of socialist countries to be improved more rapidly. Thus, it will more powerfully promote the economic development of the entire socialist camp.

　　The mutual coordination of national economic plans of socialist countries is a new and very important phenomenon in the world economy. This cooperation embodies the principle of socialist international division of labor and the great spirit of proletarian international solidarity and mutual assistance. The characteristic of socialist international division of labor is that it is based on complete equality and mutual benefit and ensures the common progress of the national economy of various countries. It is fundamentally different from the competitive hostility between capitalist countries and the relationship between strong countries enslaving weak countries. Every country participating in the economic cooperation of socialist countries, regardless of its size and degree of economic development, is an equal economic unit, and its national sovereignty and national interests are absolutely respected.

　　However, it must be pointed out that the strengthening of economic cooperation among socialist countries does not mean the neglect and weakening of their economic ties with capitalist countries. The common cooperation of socialist countries is precisely for the purpose of strengthening peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between countries with different social systems. Socialist countries have always advocated peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems and have worked hard to develop economic and cultural relations with these countries. The significant growth of their trade with European, Middle Eastern, Southeast Asian, and Latin American countries in recent years is proof of this. The strengthening of economic cooperation among socialist countries will continuously enhance their economic strength, thereby providing more favorable conditions for expanding their trade relations with capitalist countries.

### 社会主义各国经济合作的新阶段

    社会主义各国经济合作的新阶段
    由苏联、欧洲各人民民主国家组成的欧洲八国经济互助委员会在最近举行的一次常会上，讨论了与会各国之间在国民经济远景发展上相互配合的问题。中华人民共和国和南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的代表也以观察员的身份参加了会议。这次会议所通过的重要决定，标志着社会主义各国经济合作的新阶段的开始。其目的是促进人民民主国家国民经济的共同高涨。
    以生产资料的社会主义所有制为基础的社会主义各国，具有不同的经济发展水平，不同的资源力量、生产特点和技术条件。为了恢复被战争破坏的国民经济和谋求共同的经济高涨，早在第二次世界大战以后的最初几年内，这些国家之间就开始进行了平等互利的经济合作。这种合作曾有效地促进了各国经济的迅速发展，对于增强整个社会主义阵营的经济力量起了重要的作用。但是在过去这个时期内，社会主义各国的经济合作主要还限于进行贸易，互相供应原料、装备，提供信贷援助，进行科学技术合作等形式。那时每一个国家都单独地拟订和执行本国的国民经济计划，而缺乏事先的互相协调配合。为了使社会主义经济力量更快更大地发展和加速技术的进步，就要求充分利用社会主义各国经济合作的一切尚未利用的可能，扩大这种合作的规模，并把它提到更高的水平上来。由于各国几年来在经济联系中所积累的经验，彼此对于各国生产条件和经济需求的更好了解，也就为进一步发展社会主义各国的经济合作提供了有利的条件。
    欧洲八国经济互助委员会的这次会议就是在这种情况之下举行的。在进行了一年多的研究和准备工作以后，八国经济互助委员会已决定在与会各国的主要重工业部门和轻工业、农业今后五年（1956—1960年）的发展上进行密切的配合。
    在国民经济远景计划的相互配合之下，每一个国家的利益就能够同整个社会主义阵营的经济利益更好地结合起来，每一个国家在发展经济时不但可以动用本国的资源，而且还可以预先估计到来自各兄弟国家的帮助。也就是说，在一定时期内，每一个国家都能很明确地规划出并预见到本国经济发展的前景，它的产品销售和原料来源能够事先获得可靠的保证。同时，远景计划的配合，更为社会主义各国之间广泛实行生产专业化和协作化创造前提，使各国在工业生产中避免不必要的平行和重复现象，以便集中力量来发展那些本国具有最有利条件的生产部门。
    这次会议在审查机器制造和光学仪器工业的发展远景时，制定了关于扩大各国的生产专业化和保证技术的进一步提高的措施。大家知道，机器制造业是重工业的心脏，它对保证技术的不断革新和整个国民经济的高涨有着最重要的作用。但是机器制造业同时也是需要大量投资的工业部门，如果在国际规模上实行和扩大生产的专业化，某些国家就能够专门生产某些基本类型的机器设备，而通过相互交换的途径来满足彼此的需要。这不但可以节省大量的投资，而且还能够充分地利用每一个国家的生产潜力，缩短产品的生产周期，为实行全面机械化和自动化创造有利的条件，从而大大地提高劳动生产率、降低产品成本和增加赢利。其最终结果则是促进整个社会主义阵营机器制造业和其他经济部门的迅速发展。
    随着社会主义各国经济的发展，对于工业原料和燃料的需求也日益增长。因此，保证各国原料和燃料基础的不断扩展就成为十分重要的事情。这次会议审查了关于黑色和有色冶金工业的原料基础的发展问题，并且特别强调了经济互助委员会参加国之间的经济合作在保证欧洲人民民主国家获得波兰所盛产的硬煤及苏联所盛产的铁矿砂方面的重要作用。同时，为了满足欧洲各人民民主国家经济发展中的电力的需要，会议也通过了旨在拟定关于扩大与会各国之间的电力交换的建议，以及共同开发利用多瑙河水力发电资源的建议的工作计划。
    这次会议除对工业的相互配合问题进行了讨论外，还对农业发展的远景计划，特别是对农业的增产和调整供应的问题给予了相当的重视。为了保证增产，会议对大力扩展矿物肥料工业和进一步发展农业机器生产问题，以及这方面的相互配合问题，制定了重要的建议。
    国民经济长期发展计划的密切配合，是社会主义各国经济合作的更高形式。它为充分发掘社会主义各国总的资源力量和生产潜力开辟了无限的远景，它将使社会主义各国的劳动生产率更迅速提高。从而更有力地促进整个社会主义阵营的经济的发展。
    社会主义各国国民经济计划的相互配合，是世界经济中的一个新的十分重要的现象。这种合作体现着社会主义国际分工的原则和无产阶级国际团结互助的伟大精神。社会主义国际分工的特点在于它是建立在完全平等互利的基础之上的，是保证各国的国民经济共同前进的。它和资本主义国家之间的竞争敌对和强国奴役弱国的关系有着根本区别。参加社会主义各国经济合作的每一个国家，不论它的大小和经济发展程度，都是平等的经济单位，它的国家主权和民族利益受到绝对的尊重。
    但是，必须指出，社会主义各国经济合作的加强决不是意味着它们对资本主义国家经济联系的忽视和削弱。社会主义国家的共同合作正是为着加强和不同社会制度国家的和平共处和和平竞赛。社会主义各国一贯主张不同社会制度国家的和平共处，并为发展同这些国家的经济和文化关系而努力。近年来它们同欧洲、中近东、东南亚和拉丁美洲各国贸易的显著增长就是事实的证明。社会主义各国经济合作的加强将使它们的经济力量不断增进，从而为扩大它们同资本主义国家的贸易关系提供更加有利的条件。
