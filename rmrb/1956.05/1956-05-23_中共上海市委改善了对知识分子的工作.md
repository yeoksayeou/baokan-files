    The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Improves Its Work with Intellectuals
    Shi Ximin, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    Shanghai is one of the cities with a high concentration of intellectuals. According to preliminary statistics, there are more than 10,000 senior intellectuals. Doing a good job in the work related to intellectuals is one of the important tasks of the Shanghai Party organization.

    Since the Party Central Committee convened the meeting on the issue of intellectuals, the political enthusiasm of intellectuals in Shanghai has soared unprecedentedly, and many new aspects have emerged in their work and study. The atmosphere of academic research in various universities and scientific research institutions is increasing day by day. Everyone is actively formulating scientific research plans and individual advanced study plans and holding scientific seminars. The previously dispersed research forces in philosophy and social sciences have also begun to organize. The number of people reading in libraries has also increased greatly, and borrowing science and technology books requires queuing. A few traditional Chinese medicine practitioners have also opened their long-shelved book boxes and are reviewing medical books. Many engineering and technical personnel enthusiastically participated in socialist competitions, striving to complete their work tasks ahead of schedule. The enthusiasm of intellectuals for studying Marxist-Leninist theory has also increased significantly.

    The basic methods of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in implementing the Central Committee's instructions on the issue of intellectuals are to start with educating and mobilizing the entire Party, inspecting the work on intellectuals, and formulating a draft of the Shanghai Municipal Two-Year Work Outline for Intellectuals. When formulating this draft outline, attention was also paid to soliciting the opinions of intellectuals widely. The Shanghai Municipal Committee's draft two-year work outline for intellectuals was submitted to the plenary session of the Municipal Political Consultative Conference in April for discussion and solicitation of opinions after internal Party discussions. Judging from the results of this stage of work, formulating a short-term (two-year) work plan has greatly promoted the improvement of work on intellectuals. Such a plan clarifies the goals, specific requirements, and specific methods of the Shanghai Party organization and intellectuals in their work in Shanghai during a certain period.

    Among intellectuals, there are senior intellectuals and general intellectuals, and the work of each intellectual is different. Therefore, when drafting the work outline for intellectuals, the first issue encountered was: Where should the focus of the work outline be placed? The Municipal Committee studied the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions and considered the tasks of the local Party organizations, and determined to focus on fully leveraging the potential of existing intellectuals. To achieve this, it is necessary to improve the relationship between the Party and intellectuals, improve the working conditions, living conditions, and political and professional study conditions of intellectuals, and put forward relatively specific measures, stipulating the responsible units and the completion period. Other plans that must be uniformly formulated by the relevant central business departments, such as the direction of scientific research, long-term scientific research plans, and cadre training plans, are not listed as priorities. In this outline, only some guarantee methods are appropriately specified. The results of the three-month trial implementation have proved that this determination is more in line with actual needs.

    Due to the existence of a work plan, the Shanghai Municipal Committee has promoted Party organizations at all levels to carry out tremendous ideological and organizational work in accordance with the requirements of the plan. Some problems that have not been resolved for many years are now beginning to be addressed. For example, the issue of guaranteeing the professional time of experts and scholars has undergone many changes after various parties involved expanded the list of social activists, reduced excessive concurrent positions of some people, equipped administrative assistants, and streamlined unnecessary meetings, in accordance with the methods pointed out in the work plan. The professional time of most people has been basically guaranteed. Another example is the work of books and materials, which is of most concern to experts and scholars, has also begun to improve. Two libraries in Shanghai for scientific research are expanding and improving their facilities in accordance with the requirements of the plan. The work of the International Bookstore in supplying foreign language books has also been improved, and the library facilities of various universities and major factories have been increased. Certain achievements have also been made in the job placement of unemployed and unemployed intellectuals. As of the end of March, Shanghai has transferred more than 10,000 unemployed and unemployed intellectuals to other places to participate in work, and more than 90 old intellectuals who meet the prescribed conditions have joined the work of the Museum of Literature and History and other units, and more than 40 famous elderly handicraft workers have been absorbed into the Handicraft Industry Administration as consultants. The work of developing Party members among senior intellectuals has also been carried out, and 112 outstanding senior intellectuals have been approved to join the Party. In terms of caring for living conditions, the draft work outline of the Municipal Committee stipulates that 500 houses will be allocated for famous experts and scholars to live in, of which more than 270 houses have begun to be allocated. The medical conditions of more than 3,000 senior intellectuals have been improved. In order to meet the needs of intellectuals for Marxist-Leninist theory learning, some unreasonable learning organization methods have begun to be corrected. All of this series of work, although only just beginning, embodies the care of the Party and the government for intellectuals, encourages and improves the enthusiasm and creativity of intellectuals, and eliminates the concerns of a few intellectuals who lack confidence. Many intellectuals were very moved to see that the central government's instructions were being conscientiously implemented from top to bottom.

    In order to further realize the work tasks put forward in the Shanghai Municipal Committee's two-year draft work outline for intellectuals, the Municipal Committee is currently preparing to focus on solving the following problems.

    First, strengthen the ideological work of Party organizations on intellectuals. Continue to criticize sectarian sentiments in some units where the implementation of the Central Committee's various policies on uniting intellectuals has been poor. However, it is worth noting that, due to the recent period of more concern for improving the working and living conditions of intellectuals, a tendency to neglect ideological leadership has grown in some Party organizations. These Party organizations only see the high socialist enthusiasm of intellectuals under the encouragement of the Party's policies and the increased enthusiasm for scientific research, thinking that all problems have been solved; and do not understand that under the high enthusiasm of intellectuals, some new problems will arise that need to be solved by Party organizations. For example, at present, the ideological understanding of the vast number of intellectuals about marching towards science is quite confused. Many people do not understand that marching towards science is comprehensive, including both natural sciences and social sciences; including both academic research and mastering their own work. At the same time, they should start from their existing level. Due to the lack of correct understanding of this issue, many people are not at ease with their jobs, requesting to change careers and wanting to bury themselves in scientific research work and become great scientists. Another example is that among scientific researchers, the issues of what their research direction is and how to treat and cultivate new forces have not been completely resolved. Because some Party organizations do not study the ideological situation of intellectuals, and do not provide necessary persuasion and education for the incorrect ideas and excessive demands among them; therefore, some problems that can be solved have not been solved to this day. This lack of ideological leadership is also manifested in solving the time arrangement problem for intellectuals. Many Party organizations only care about guaranteeing six-fifths of the working time, and do not care about the arrangement of one-sixth of the time. Individual units even vulgarly focus on improving the living conditions of intellectuals. The above situation shows that it is necessary to overcome the tendency of Party organizations to neglect ideological leadership and do a good job in the ideological work of intellectuals.

    Secondly, it is necessary to specifically study and improve the ideological and organizational work of Party organizations in promoting academic research and professional study. At present, some experts have reflected: "The Party organization is really meticulous in taking care of our lives, but for a person who loves science, things in life are insignificant. The important thing is to help scientific workers solve academic problems, research aspects of the guidelines, tasks and practices, etc." Such calls will gradually increase in the future. At present, we must first start to solve the following three aspects of the problem: First, it is necessary to carry out the education of the Central Committee's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" on academic issues inside and outside the Party, eliminate incorrect ideas that hinder the development of academic freedom research and free discussion, and encourage academic research. Educate Party member cadres to distinguish the different nature and different leadership methods of political issues, ideological issues, and academic, technical, and artistic nature issues, clearly recognize the importance of advocating free academic discussion, and avoid rude attitudes towards academic issues. Second, under the overall scientific research plan of the central competent department, the Party organization should promote the unit to do a good job in scientific research planning, exchange the experience and lessons of formulating plans, and develop scientific research work. Third, strengthen the cooperation and coordination of scientific research forces in Shanghai, investigate talents with certain expertise in agencies, factories, enterprises, and society, and tap potential forces. Give full play to the role of the more than 20 professional societies affiliated to the Shanghai Branch of the China Association for Science and Technology, and specifically solve problems such as personnel allocation.

    中共上海市委改善了对知识分子的工作
    中共上海市委宣传部长  石西民
    上海是知识分子很集中的城市之一，据初步统计，高级知识分子就达一万人以上。做好知识分子工作，是上海党组织的重要任务之一。
    自从党中央召开关于知识分子问题会议以来，上海市知识分子的政治积极性空前地高涨起来，在工作和学习中都出现了许多新的气象。各高等学校、科学研究机关的学术研究空气日益增涨，大家都在积极地拟订科学研究规划和个人的进修计划，召开科学讨论会。平时分散的哲学、社会科学的研究力量，也开始组织起来。图书馆中读书的人数也大为增多，借阅科学技术图书挤得要排队。少数中医也打开了搁置很久的书箱，温读医书。许多工程技术人员热情地参加了社会主义竞赛，争取提前完成自己的工作任务。知识分子学习马克思、列宁主义理论的积极性也有了显著的增长。
    中共上海市委贯彻执行中央关于知识分子问题的指示的基本办法，是从教育发动全党，检查知识分子工作着手，制定了上海市两年知识分子工作纲要草案。在制定这个纲要草案的时候，还注意广泛地征求了知识分子的意见。上海市委的两年知识分子工作纲要草案，经过党内讨论之后，于四月间又提交市政治协商会议全体委员会讨论，征求意见。根据这一阶段工作的结果来看，订出一个短期的（两年）工作规划，对改善知识分子工作是有很大推动作用的。这样的规划，使上海市党组织和知识分子都明确了一定时期上海知识分子工作的奋斗目标、具体要求和具体作法。
    知识分子中，有高级知识分子，有一般知识分子，各个知识分子的业务又都不同。因此在拟订知识分子工作纲要草案的时候，首先接触到的一个问题是，工作纲要的重点，究竟应放在什么地方？市委研究了中央指示精神，考虑了地方党组织的任务，确定以充分发挥现有知识分子的潜力为中心。为了做到这一点，就要改善党和知识分子的关系，改善知识分子的工作条件，生活条件和政治业务学习条件，并且提出比较具体的措施，规定出负责的单位和完成的期限。其它必须由中央有关业务主管部门来统一拟订的规划，如科学研究方向，科学研究长远规划，干部培养计划等则不列为重点。在这个纲要中，只适当规定了一些保证的方法。三个月来试行的结果，证明这样确定是比较符合实际情况需要的。
    由于有了一个工作规划，上海市委推动各级党组织按照规划的要求进行了巨大的思想工作和组织工作。一些多年来未曾解决的问题，现在开始着手解决。例如专家学者的业务时间的保证问题，经过各有关方面按照工作规划所指出的办法，扩大社会活动者的名单，减少某些人过多的兼职，配备行政助手，精减不必要的会议等一系列措施，情况已有很多变化，大多数人的业务时间基本上得到了保证。又如专家学者所最关心的图书资料工作，也开始有了改善。上海两所供科学研究用的图书馆正按照规划要求在扩充和改善设备。国际书店供应外文书籍的工作也有所改进，各高等学校和各大工厂的图书设备都有所增加。无业失业知识分子的工作安排，也已做出了一定成绩。至三月底止，上海已有一万多无业失业知识分子调往外地参加工作，九十多个符合规定条件的旧知识分子参加了文史馆等单位的工作，四十多个著名的老年手艺工人被吸收到手工业管理局当顾问。高级知识分子中的发展党员的工作也有了开展，一百一十二名优秀的高级知识分子已被批准入党。在生活条件的照顾方面，市委工作纲要草案规定拨出五百户住宅供著名专家学者居住，其中二百七十多户住宅已开始分配。三千多名高级知识分子的医疗条件有了改善。为了满足知识分子的马克思列宁主义理论学习，某些不合理的学习编组方法，已开始纠正。所有这一系列工作，虽然还只是开始，但是它体现了党和政府对知识分子的关怀，鼓舞和提高了知识分子的积极性和创造 性，消除了少数知识分子信心不足的顾虑。许多知识分子看到从上到下都在认真地贯彻执行中央的指示，非常感动。
    为了进一步实现上海市委两年知识分子工作纲要草案所提出的工作任务，目前市委准备着重解决以下几个问题。
    首先，加强党组织对知识分子的思想工作。在某些贯彻执行中央关于团结知识分子各项政策做得较差的单位，继续批判宗派情绪。但是值得注意的是，由于最近一个时期较多地关心改善知识分子工作、生活等条件，已在某些党组织中滋长了一种忽视思想领导的倾向。这些党组织只看到知识分子在党的政策鼓舞下社会主义积极性高涨、科学研究热情提高的一方面，以为一切问题都已经解决；而不了解在知识分子热情高涨之下，还会产生一些新的问题，需要党组织来解决。举例来说，目前广大知识分子对于向科学进军的思想认识是相当混乱的。许多人不懂得向科学进军是全面的，既包括自然科学，也包括社会科学；既包括学术研究，也包括精通自己的业务，同时，应该从自己的现有水平出发。由于对这一问题没有正确的认识，有不少人就不安心于自己岗位的工作，要求改行，想埋头于科学研究工作，做一个大科学家。又如在科学研究人员中，对于自己的研究方向是什么，应该如何对待和培养新生力量等问题，也都没有得到完全的解决。由于某些党组织不研究知识分子的思想情况，对其中不正确思想和过高要求也不作必要的说服教育；因此，有些可以解决的问题，至今没有得到解决。这种缺乏思想领导也表现在解决知识分子的时间安排问题上，不少党组织只管六分之五的业务时间的保证，不关心六分之一时间的安排。个别单位甚至庸俗地把改进知识分子工作的重点仅仅放在改善生活条件上。以上情况说明了：必须克服党组织忽视思想领导的倾向，做好对知识分子的思想工作。
    其次，要具体研究改善党组织在推进学术研究和业务钻研中的思想工作和组织工作。目前已经有一些专家反映：“党组织对我们的生活照顾真是无微不至，可是对一个热爱科学的人来说，生活方面的事情是微不足道的，重要的是要帮助科学工作者解决学术的，研究方面的方针、任务和做法等问题。”这样的呼声，今后将日渐增多。目前首先要着手来解决这样三方面的问题：第一，需要在党内党外进行中央关于学术问题的百家争鸣方针的教育，清除阻碍开展学术自由研究、自由讨论的不正确思想，鼓励学术研究。教育党员干部区别政治问题、思想问题和学术、技术、艺术性质问题的不
  同性质和不同领导方法，明确认识提倡学术自由讨论的重要意义，避免对待学术问题的粗暴态度。第二，在中央主管部门的总的科学研究规划之下，党组织要推动本单位做好科学研究规划，交流制定规划的经验教训，发展科学研究工作。第三，加强上海科学研究力量的协作配合，调查机关、工厂、企业、社会各方面有一定专长的人才，发掘潜在力量。充分发挥中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会上海分会所属的二十多个专业学会的作用，具体解决人力配备等问题。
