    Happy Later Years
    A Visit to Beijing No. 1 Nursing Home
    By Our Correspondent Ge Xian

    People are very concerned about how our country properly arranges for the elderly who are helpless, homeless, and unable to maintain their livelihoods. After visiting Beijing No. 1 Nursing Home, I can tell people that these elderly people live very well in the nursing home.

    In Beijing, there are three similar nursing homes. These three nursing homes house more than a thousand lonely elderly men and women and disabled people over the age of 55, who lead carefree lives in their later years.

    The more than 500 lonely old men and disabled people living in Beijing No. 1 Nursing Home are mostly working people who were abandoned in the old society. Many of them worked from childhood until old age, and the old society still left them with nothing. Some wandered the streets begging, some were crippled, and some lost their ability to work and could not maintain their livelihoods. Among these people, although some of them had acquired very bad habits in the old society and even committed misdeeds, these people have undergone great changes due to the care and education of the People's Government. Since the People's Government took over the Kuomintang's old people's homes after liberation and turned them into genuine nursing homes, this group of lonely people in society has been properly settled. These elderly people in the First Nursing Home live in 150 newly built houses, which face south, and sunlight can shine into the rooms through the large glass windows.

    The director of the First Nursing Home told me that the daily necessities of the elderly are entirely provided by the state. Because the elderly are afraid of the cold, the cotton clothes and quilts issued to them in winter are very thick. Now it is early summer, and the elderly have changed their clothes. In a room specifically for elderly people over the age of 80, I saw 98-year-old Yan Zhensheng. When this old man was in his eighties, he was still watching over a manor for a landlord and never had a stable life. After liberation, he entered the nursing home, and the quiet life made his mood cheerful and his spirits better. In January this year, the nursing home conducted another physical examination for everyone and found no signs of malnutrition.

    In this nursing home, there are also bathrooms, barber shops, and a large auditorium for cultural and recreational activities. The clinic has more than 300 kinds of medicines, which are sufficient to treat the general diseases of the elderly. If patients need isolation and recuperation, they can stay in the patient recuperation room. If there are chronic diseases that require long-term recuperation, they can also go to a specially established sanatorium for recuperation. After the physical examination this year, 37 elderly people have already gone to the sanatorium.

    Every day, the elderly like to take a walk and water the flowers in the courtyard early in the morning. Then, they clean the inside and outside of the house very cleanly. Bian Xicai, who was a miner in the old society and had his leg broken by a stone, lost his job and begged for ten years, is now a hygiene model for the entire nursing home. Bian Xicai said to me: "If it weren't for the Communist Party who saved me, I wouldn't even be able to find my bones." On the day I visited, Bian Xicai and dozens of elderly people were studying culture in groups in the auditorium. Recently, more than 80 elderly people in the nursing home signed up to participate in the elimination of illiteracy, actively requesting to learn culture.

    In the evening, the auditorium becomes lively, with operas and chess games. The elderly folk art group and the elderly Peking opera group have both performance tools and various talents. Peking opera, storytelling, drum ballad, clapper talk, and storytelling are all available. The rich and interesting cultural and recreational life makes these elderly people younger, more energetic, and makes them feel happy to live in a collective family.

    I also found in the First Nursing Home that many elderly people are working enthusiastically and happily. In a bag-weaving production room, I saw several white-bearded old men, and the straw tote bags they weaved were equally fine and beautiful. In the first quarter of this year, they wove more than 2,000 straw tote bags for the cooperative. In addition to weaving bags, pasting matchboxes, making shoe soles, raising pigs, and making tofu, they also grow some oil crops. The director told me that 60% of the income from the elderly's handicraft production belongs to individuals, and 40% is used for collective welfare. 70% of agricultural production belongs to individuals. Many elderly people believe that participating in some light labor suitable for their physical conditions can not only regulate their spirits but also make their bodies healthier. The production income not only increases the collective welfare but also increases personal income, so the elderly are very interested in labor. They also feel honored to be able to contribute to socialist construction. The director told me: Here, we focus on taking good care of the elderly. For some elderly people who are too old and weak, there are also special people to take care of them, so living here, you don't have to worry about anything.

    幸福的晚年
    北京市第一养老院访问记
    本报记者　葛娴
    人们都很关心，我们国家是怎样妥善安置那些无依无靠、无家可归和无法维持生活的老年人的呢？我在访问了北京市第一养老院之后，就可以告诉人们，这些老年人住在养老院里，生活得都很好。
    在北京，同样的养老院有三个。在这三个养老院里，住着一千多个五十五岁以上的孤单的男女老年人和残废者，他们过着无忧无虑的晚年生活。
    在北京市第一养老院住着的五百多个孤老头子和残废者，他们大多数是在旧社会里被遗弃了的劳动人民。其中很多人都是从小就做工，直到老年，旧社会仍然使他们一无所得。有的流落街头行乞，有的被摧残成为残废，有的失去了劳动力，无法维持生活。在这些人中，虽然有的人在旧社会里也曾染上了很坏的习气，甚至有过为非作歹的坏行为。但是，由于人民政府对他们的关怀和教养，使这些人有了很大的转变。人民政府在解放以后，接收了国民党的安老所，并使它变为名符其实的养老院以来，社会上的这一群孤苦的人都得到了妥善的安置。为第一养老院的这些老年人住在新盖的一百五十间房子里，住房是朝南的，阳光可以通过宽大的玻璃窗射进屋里来。
    第一养老院的院长告诉我，老人们的生活用品完全是由国家供给的。因为老人们怕冷，所以冬天发给他们的棉衣和棉被都是很厚的。现在已是初夏，老人们都换了服装。我在一间专门住着八十岁以上的老人室里，看见了九十八岁的老人阎振声。这个老人八十多岁的时候，还在地主家看庄园，一生没有过过安稳的日子。解放后他进了养老院，安静的生活使他的心情变得愉快起来，精神也好了。今年一月间，院里为大家又作了一次体格检查，没有发现有营养不良的现象。
    在这个养老院里，还有浴室、理发室和一个供文化娱乐用的大礼堂。诊疗室里三百多种药品，足可以治疗老人们的一般疾病。如果病人需要隔离休养，可以住病人疗养室。如果有慢性疾病需要长期休养的，还可以到一个专设的疗养所里去疗养。今年体格检查以后，已经有三十七个老人去疗养了。
    每天，老人们喜欢一大早就到院子里散散步、浇浇花。然后，把屋子里里外外都打扫得很干净。曾经在旧社会里当矿工被石头砸断了腿，因而失了业，行乞十年的卞喜才，现在成了全院的卫生模范。卞喜才向我说：“要不是共产党救了我，我这付骨头也寻不见了。”我去访问的那天，卞喜才同几十个老人正在大礼堂里进行编组学文化。最近，院里有八十多个老人报名参加扫除文盲的学习，积极要求学文化。
    一到晚上，大礼堂里就热闹起来了，不是唱戏就是下棋。老人曲艺组和老人京剧组既有演唱的工具，也有各种各样的人才。京剧、评弹、大鼓、快板、说书样样都有。丰富有趣的文化娱乐生活，使这些老年人变年轻了，有精神了，也使他们感到生活在集体大家庭里，是很快乐的。
    我在第一养老院里还发现：许多老人热情、愉快地劳动着。在一间编包生产室里，我看见了好几个白胡子的老头，他们所编出的草提包也一样细匀、好看。在今年第一季度中，他们为合作社编好了二千多个草提包。他们除编包、糊火柴盒，纳鞋底，养猪和做豆腐之外，还种一部分油料作物。院长告诉我：老人们进行手工生产的收入，60％是归个人，40％是办集体福利。农业生产70％都归个人所有。许多老人都认为，能参加一些适合于自己身体条件的轻微劳动，不但可以调剂精神，还可以使身体更加健康。生产所得，既增加了集体的福利，又增加了个人的收入，所以老人们的劳动兴趣都很好。他们也为能给社会主义建设贡献一份力量而感到光荣。院长告诉我：在我们这里是以养好为主的，对一些年纪太大的和身体弱的老年人，还专门有人来照应他们，所以生活在这里，一切都不用自己耽心。
