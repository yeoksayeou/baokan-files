Xinhua News Agency, Xigaze, 19th—The central delegation's main group left Xigaze today. Twenty-five thousand citizens of Xigaze, suburban farmers, and lamas went to the eastern suburbs of Xigaze to see them off.

The Panchen Erdeni accompanied Chen Yi, head of the central delegation, in a car through the cheering crowd, which stretched for several miles. At this moment, the farewell procession resounded with storm-like cheers, and people waved hadas and bouquets, shouting, "Thank you to the Central Government for its care for Tibet."

A grand farewell meeting was held at Quxia Zhaxigang, where the Nyang Chu River and Yarlung Tsangpo River meet. The Panchen Erdeni delivered a farewell speech, saying: "At today's farewell meeting, our hearts are filled with reluctance. In the future, we must further consolidate the unity within Tibet and between the Han and Tibetan nationalities, continue to carry forward our anti-imperialist and patriotic strength, and strive for the victorious implementation of democratic reforms and social reforms, the early establishment of a unified Tibet Autonomous Region, and the construction of a prosperous and happy new Tibet."

Chen Yi spoke at the farewell meeting, expressing his gratitude on behalf of the central delegation to the Panchen Erdeni and the people of Xigaze for their warm send-off. After the farewell meeting, the main officials of the Panchen Kampus Council escorted the central delegation to Dazhuka, more than 80 kilometers away from Xigaze.

On the eve of the departure of the central delegation's main group, the Panchen Kampus Council and the Xigaze Sub-Committee of the CCP Tibet Working Committee jointly held a grand farewell banquet at Deqing Phodrang Lingka.
