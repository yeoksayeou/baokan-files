Xinhua News Agency, 17th - The Ministry of Culture and the Chinese Dramatists Association invited over two hundred prominent figures from the capital's literary and art circles to a symposium on the Kunqu Opera "Fifteen Strings of Cash" on the 17th.

    Premier Zhou Enlai attended the symposium. When the leading actors of "Fifteen Strings of Cash," Zhou Chuan'ying, Wang Chuansong, Zhu Guoliang, and others arrived at the venue, Premier Zhou shook hands with them warmly.

    The symposium was presided over by Zhou Yang, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture, Tian Han, Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, Zhou Chuan'ying, Head of the Zhejiang Kunsu Opera Troupe, and Ma Shizeng, Head of the Guangdong Yue Opera Troupe, who is currently in Beijing.

    Zhou Chuan'ying reported on the process of the Kunsu Opera Troupe adapting the traditional play "Fifteen Strings of Cash" with the help of relevant departments in Zhejiang Province. He recalled with emotion that before liberation, he and several actors from the current Kunsu Opera Troupe had formed a small troupe to inherit and promote the art of Kunqu, but this troupe was always looked down upon and often struggled to make ends meet. Now, however, they have received such attention from the state. He said, "The troupe's achievements today are all due to the support and cultivation of the Communist Party of China."

    Wang Chuansong also reported on his experience in creating the image of the villain Lou Ashu in "Fifteen Strings of Cash."

    Dramatists Zhang Geng, Ma Yanxiang, and musician He Wei all spoke. They praised the achievements of the relevant departments in Zhejiang Province and the Kunsu Opera Troupe in creatively adapting "Fifteen Strings of Cash" and reforming Kunqu music. They also highly praised the performance art of the main actors and the director's handling of the play.

    Tian Han and Ma Shizeng also spoke.

    Finally, Premier Zhou said, "Fifteen Strings of Cash" has rich people's character, a fairly high ideological content, and artistic value. It not only allows the classical art of Kunqu to shine with new brilliance but also shows that historical plays can also play a good role in practical education, making people pay more attention to the fine traditions of national art and setting a good example for further implementing the policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Weeding Through the Old to Bring Forth the New." The script of "Fifteen Strings of Cash" can become a successful example of adapting classical scripts. It can be adopted not only in Kunsu Opera but also in other opera genres when conditions permit.

    Also present at the symposium were Ding Xilin, Liu Zhiming, Xia Yan, and Chen Kehan, Vice Ministers of Culture, Chen Yi, Director of the Cultural Department of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, writers Lao She, Yang Hansheng, Chen Baichen, and Chen Qitong, veteran Peking Opera artists Xiao Changhua and Hao Shouchen, veteran Kunqu artists Bai Yunsheng and Han Shichang, as well as Yue Opera actress Hong Xiannu, Jin Opera actress Ding Guoxian, Shanghai Opera actors Wang Pansheng and Wang Yaqin, who are currently in Beijing, and outstanding actors participating in the National Workers' Amateur Quyi Performance and Observation Meeting, among others.

    文艺界人士举行昆曲“十五贯”座谈会
    周总理称赞这个戏是“ 百花齐放、推陈出新”的榜样
    新华社17日讯　文化部和中国戏剧家协会十七日邀请首都文艺界著名人士二百多人举行昆曲“十五贯”座谈会。
    周恩来总理出席了座谈会。当“十五贯”主要演员周传瑛、王传淞、朱国梁等到达会场时，周总理和他们亲切握手。
    座谈会由中共中央宣传部副部长周扬、文化部副部长钱俊瑞、中国戏剧家协会主席田汉、浙江省昆苏剧团团长周传瑛和正在北京的广东粤剧团团长马师曾主持。
    周传瑛报告了昆苏剧团在浙江省有关部门帮助下改编传统剧目“十五贯”的经过。他感慨地讲起，在解放前，他曾和现在昆苏剧团的几个演员为了继承和发扬昆曲艺术，组织了一个小小的剧团，可是这个剧团一直被人轻视，很多时候连饭都吃不上。现在，他们却受到了国家这样的重视。他说：“剧团能有今天的成就，都是由于中国共产党的支持和培养。”
    王传淞也报告了他创造“十五贯”中反派人物娄阿鼠形象的体会。
    戏剧家张庚、马彦祥和音乐家何为都讲了话。他们赞扬了浙江省有关部门和昆苏剧团创造性地改编“十五贯”和改革昆曲音乐的成就，并且对昆苏剧团主要演员的表演艺术和导演的处理手法作了很高评价。
    田汉、马师曾也讲了话。
    最后，周总理讲话说：“十五贯”有着丰富的人民性、相当高的思想性和艺术性，它不仅使古典的昆曲艺术放出新的光彩，而且说明了历史剧同样可以很好地起现实的教育作用，使人们更加重视民族艺术的优良传统，为进一步贯彻执行“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针，树立了良好榜样。“十五贯”这个剧本，可以成为改编古典剧本的成功典型，它不只在昆苏剧中可以采用；在有条件的时候，其他剧种也可以采用。
    出席座谈会的还有文化部副部长丁西林、刘芝明、夏衍、陈克寒，中国人民解放军总政治部文化部部长陈沂，作家老舍、阳翰笙、陈白尘、陈其通，京剧老艺人萧长华、郝寿臣，昆曲老艺人白云生、韩世昌，以及正在北京的粤剧演员红线女、晋剧演员丁果仙、沪剧演员王盘声、王雅琴和参加全国职工业余曲艺观摩演出会的优秀演员等人。
