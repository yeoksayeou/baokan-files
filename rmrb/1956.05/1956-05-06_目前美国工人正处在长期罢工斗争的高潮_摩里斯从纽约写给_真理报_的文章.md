Xinhua News Agency, May 5th, Moscow dispatch from TASS, May 3rd: "Pravda" published an article from New York by Morris stating that American workers are currently at the high tide of a new movement of fierce struggle, at the high tide of protracted strike struggles.

The owners' offensive and the workers' high degree of defensive spirit can be seen from the persistence of both sides and the duration of the strikes. The strike of workers at the Kohler Company in Wisconsin entered its third year on April 5th. The strike of hotel workers in Miami entered its second year this week. Most strikes last for weeks, even months.

Another characteristic is that business owners are currently restoring some pre-war methods: implementing injunctions, police terror, large-scale recruitment of strikebreakers, and so on.

The third characteristic of the current struggle is the high degree of solidarity among the working class. In areas where strikes occur, federations of all trade unions are often established to support the striking workers. American workers no longer harbor illusions of "permanent prosperity." This is a major difference between the current situation and the situation in the 1920s. American workers now live in fear, worried about the arrival of a crisis. The frequent lack of confidence in tomorrow's "prosperity" and the workers' fighting spirit to defend their living standards are the reasons for the huge mass pressure that led to the merger of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations. This merger can primarily be described as a defensive measure. But the process of creating the merger is also driving workers to take offensive action.

Morris's article also discussed some of the dangers facing the American labor movement. That is: George Meany, the chairman of the "AFL-CIO," known for his extreme reactionism, is engaged in a struggle to completely control the labor movement; big businesses are supporting the movement for new bills that would directly and more cruelly strike at unions; and the American authorities are persecuting progressive elements in the unions.

He pointed out that despite these persecutions, left-wing elements in the unions have recovered from the brutal blows of the McCarthy era. The main efforts of progressive elements in the unions are currently focused on mobilizing the strength of the union masses.

　　目前美国工人正处在长期罢工斗争的高潮
    摩里斯从纽约写给“真理报”的文章
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科三日讯：“真理报”刊载的摩里斯从纽约寄来的一篇文章写道，目前美国工人正处在残酷斗争新运动的高潮，处在长期罢工斗争的高潮。
    企业主的进攻和工人的高度防御精神，可以从双方的坚持性和罢工的持久性里看到。威斯康星州科赫勒公司工人的罢工从四月五日起进入了第三年。迈阿密旅馆工人的罢工同星期进入了第二年。大多数罢工都是坚持好几个星期，好几个月。
    另一方面的特点是：企业主目前正在恢复战前的某些办法：实行禁令，警察恐怖，大规模招收工贼等等。
    当前斗争的第三个特点是工人阶级的高度团结。在罢工发生的地区常常成立了一切工会的联合会来支持罢工工人。美国工人目前已经不再幻想“永久繁荣”了。这一点使目前的形势同二十年代的形势有很大的区别。美国工人现在生活在恐惧中，担心着危机的到来。经常对明天的“繁荣”缺乏信心和工人们保卫自己的生活水平的斗志，是促成美国劳联和产联合并的巨大群众压力的原因。这个合并首先可说是一种防御措施。但是造成合并的过程又推动工人采取进攻行动。
    摩里斯文章里同时谈到美国工人运动所面临的某些危险现象。那就是：以极端反动著称的“劳联—产联”主席米尼正在进行着企图彻底控制工人运动的斗争；大企业正在支持着使工会受到直接的、更残酷的打击的新法案的运动；美国当局正在对工会的进步分子进行着迫害。
    他指出，虽然有这些迫害，工会中的左翼分子还是从残酷的麦卡锡主义时期的打击下振作起来了。工会中进步分子的主要努力目前正集中在动员工会群众的力量上。
