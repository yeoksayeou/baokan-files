Speculative Behavior in Accepting Large Orders
    Zhang Wei
    In Wuhan, some handicraft production cooperatives, in order to make money, inflate costs, make exorbitant demands, and even subcontract to earn intermediary fees; some production cooperatives with sluggish business also compete for business by undercutting each other; others disregard product quality, produce crudely, and pass off inferior products as good ones. These situations are more serious in the woodworking, sheet metal, electrical appliance, and sewing industries' production cooperatives.
    In February and March of this year, Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, through the supply and marketing department of the Municipal Handicraft Production Cooperative Federation, commissioned forty-five woodworking production cooperatives to manufacture more than 29,000 pieces of furniture, including desks, coir beds, bed boards, and stools. The contract stipulated that all furniture should be made of good wood worth 130 yuan per cubic meter, but most cooperatives used wood that was worth only 100 yuan per cubic meter at best, and 45 yuan per cubic meter at worst. Wuhan City No. 7 Woodworking Production Cooperative undertook to make one hundred square tables, benches, ping-pong tables, etc., and made an extra 1,360 yuan by using inferior materials as good materials. Wuhan City Nos. 2, 4, and 5 Coir Bed Production Cooperatives earned nearly double the profit because they all used inferior materials as good materials. Because the materials were not good, many of the furniture pieces produced had cracks and wormholes, and some were already rotten. In some furniture pieces with wormholes, a large hole could be made by gently digging with a finger. Some cooperatives filled the cracks in the tables with mud and then painted them, attempting to pass them off during inspection.
    Some cooperatives only planed one side of the bed boards (the contract stipulated that both sides should be planed); the stool legs were of different sizes. Some cooperatives made the tenons (the part used to join the chair surface) of the chair legs too short, so they nailed wooden pegs from the chair surface into the eye holes to make up for the difference. When the inspection comrades pulled on the chair legs, they separated from the chair surface.
    Why don't they pay attention to product quality? Because they believe that the profit from large orders is not high, and they need to find other ways to increase income. At the same time, they also have a speculative mentality, thinking that inferior products can be passed off in such large orders; moreover, the work is assigned by the supply and marketing department, and they do not meet the customers, so the customers will not know which cooperative made the product, and it will not affect the cooperative's reputation.
    If the handicrafts industry, which has fully implemented cooperativization, does not quickly change this capitalist management style, it will not only fail to complete the task of supporting national basic construction and supporting agricultural production, but the handicraft production cooperatives themselves will also lose credibility and collapse. Recently, the Wuhan Municipal Handicraft Bureau and the Municipal Handicraft Production Cooperative Federation are preparing to lead the city's handicraft production cooperatives in rectification work, and they hope to make achievements in changing the capitalist management style of these production cooperatives.

    承制大批订货中的投机行为
    张碨
    武汉市的某些手工业生产合作社，为了赚钱，浮报成本，漫天要价，甚至经手转包赚取中间费用；有的生意清淡的生产合作社，还以互相杀价的办法来抢夺生意；有的则不顾产品质量，粗制滥造，以坏品充好品。这些情况，在木器、白铁、电器、缝纫等行业的生产合作社中更为严重。
    今年二、三月份，武汉钢铁公司通过市手工业生产合作社联社供销经理部，委托四十五个木器生产合作社制造办公桌、棕床、床板、凳子等二万九千多件。合同规定家具一律采用每立方公尺价值一百三十元的好木材，但是，大部分社所采用木料，最好的每立方公尺只价值一百元，最低的四十五元。武汉市第七木器生产合作社承做一百张方桌，承制板凳、乒乓球台等，因用坏料充好料，多赚一千三百六十元。武汉市第二、第四、第五等棕床生产合作社因为全部以坏料充好料，可赚取利润将近一倍。因为材料不好，做出来的家具很多都是有裂缝、虫眼的，有的已经腐朽了。有的家具在有虫眼的地方，只要用指头轻轻挖一挖，就是一个大洞。有的社做的桌子的裂缝太大，便用泥巴糊一糊，再涂上油漆，企图在验收时混过去。
    有的社做铺板只刨光一面（合同规定要刨两面）；凳脚大小不一样。有的社把椅子腿的笋头（用来接合椅面的部分）做短了，就从椅面上往眼洞里钉木钉子补上一截。验收的同志用手一撤椅腿，椅腿就和椅面分了家。
    为什么他们这样不重视产品质量呢？因为他们认为大批订货的利润不大，需要想别的办法来增加收入。同时，他们还有一种投机取巧的想法，以为这种大批订货，产品坏些也可以混过去；况且活又是供销经理部交下来的，自己不跟主顾见面，活做的好坏，主顾也不知道是那个社做的，不会影响本社的信誉。
    全部实行了合作化的手工业，如果不迅速改变这种资本主义的经营作风，不仅无法完成支援国家基本建设和支援农业生产的任务，而且手工业生产合作社本身也将会信誉扫地而走向垮台。最近，武汉市手工业管理局和市手工业生产合作社联社正准备领导全市的手工业生产合作社进行整社工作，希望他们在改变这些生产合作社的资本主义经营作风方面作出成绩来。
