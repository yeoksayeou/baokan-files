Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd: A total of over 7.25 million people across Japan have signed petitions opposing the Japanese government's two education control bills. These signatures were collected by the Japan Teachers Union, in conjunction with approximately sixty social organizations, including local Parent-Teacher Associations, women's associations, and the Japan Association for the Defense of Children, starting from January this year.
    The Japanese government's two education bills are the new Education Committee Bill and the Textbook Bill. The former seeks to abolish the current public election system for education committees, strengthening government control over education; the latter, using the pretext that many current textbooks have "left-wing" leanings, aims to strengthen government "censorship" of textbooks.
    The ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan already forced the new Education Committee Bill through the House of Representatives on April 20th and has submitted it to the House of Councillors. The Textbook Bill is currently under review by the House of Representatives Education Committee.

    反对日本政府控制教育的法案
    日本七百多万人签名
    据新华社2日讯　东京消息：日本全国已经有725万多人签名反对日本政府的两项控制教育的法案。这些签名是日本教职员工会从今年一月起和各地的家长教师会、妇女会和日本保卫儿童会等约六十个社会团体联合征集的。
    日本政府的两个教育法案是新教育委员会法案和教科书法案。前者要取消现行教育委员会的公选制，加强政府对教育的控制；后者借口现在很多教科书有“左翼”倾向，要加强政府对教科书的“审定”。
    日本执政党自由民主党已经在四月二十日强使众议院通过了新教育委员会法案，并且把它送交参议院。教科书法案目前正在由众议院文教委员会审议。
