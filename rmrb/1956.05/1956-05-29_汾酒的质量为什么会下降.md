Why Has the Quality of Fenjiu Declined?
    Yan Jilie

    Fenjiu and Zhuyeqing wine are both special products of Shanxi Province. They have a history of more than 1,400 years, and in the past half-century, they have become famous wines at home and abroad. However, since 1954, the quality of these two wines has significantly declined, the purity of the wine fluctuates greatly, and it tastes bitter, has sediment, is turbid, and discolors. Among the Fenjiu produced this year, 870 jin are difficult to sell because of their bitter and moldy taste. Eight hundred boxes sent to the export company have already developed black or white sediment. Sales units in twenty regions, including Northeast and South China, have a backlog of more than 100,000 bottles of Fenjiu and Zhuyeqing wine that do not meet quality standards. The decline in the quality of Fenjiu has caused serious economic and political losses.

    Why has the quality of Fenjiu and Zhuyeqing wine declined? The main reason is that the leaders of the manufacturing plant—the local state-owned Xinghuacun Fenjiu Factory—have adopted a careless attitude towards maintaining the quality of famous wines.

    Fenjiu's ability to become a famous wine is not accidental. As early as 1,200 years ago, our ancestors researched the seven elements of brewing Fenjiu, which were passed down from generation to generation and became more and more refined, and later were recorded in writing. After liberation, our country's wine industry experts analyzed and studied them, giving scientific explanations.

    The wine-making element mentions: "People must obtain its essence," which means that a skilled wine-making worker should not only know how to make wine, but also know why they do it. Otherwise, they cannot be considered to "obtain its essence." However, the leaders of the Xinghuacun Fenjiu Factory have not only failed to work hard to educate workers to improve their skills and make them "obtain its essence," but even the leaders themselves do not pay attention to the research and study of wine-making technology. Sun Zhenshi, the deputy director of production, does not know what the seven elements of brewing Fenjiu are; Wang Mingchen, the director of the brewing workshop who personally directs production, does not even know the "Six Standards" (advanced experience widely promoted in the brewing industry) that the workers know by heart.

    The wine-making element says: "Qu must obtain its time." This means that to make good wine, one must have good qu (fermentation starter). The wine industry is a biochemical industry, and its entire production process is a process of dealing with bacteria. If the qu is bad and introduces miscellaneous bacteria, it will not only greatly reduce the output but also directly affect the quality of the wine. The leaders of the Xinghuacun Fenjiu Factory do not pay much attention to this point either. In 1954, the quality of the qu directly affected the quality of the wine. Since this year, under the pretext of "completing the plan ahead of schedule," they have shortened the fermentation time of the qu, and even used bad qu that is of low quality and has been rained on as good qu for production.

    The wine-making element says: "Utensils must obtain their cleanliness." This is a very valuable scientific experience, which shows that our ancestors understood the importance of hygiene 1,200 years ago and understood "civilized production." However, the leaders of the Xinghuacun Fenjiu Factory have ignored this point. Their qu fermentation rooms and steaming workshops are often not cleaned, and many impurities are often mixed into the steaming raw materials. How can this not reduce the quality of the wine?

    Improving the quality of Fenjiu and restoring the historical honor of Fenjiu is the current important task of the Xinghuacun Winery. The leaders of the Xinghuacun Fenjiu Factory should quickly take measures to solve this problem.

    汾酒的质量为什么会下降
    阎继烈
    汾酒和竹叶青酒都是山西省的特产。它们有一千四百多年的历史，近半世纪以来，已成为驰名中外的名酒。但是，自从1954年以后，这两种酒的质量显著下降，酒的纯度忽高忽低，味苦、沉淀、混浊、变色。今年所产的汾酒中，就有870斤因为有苦味和霉味，而销售困难。出口公司调去的八百箱已经发生了黑色或白色沉淀。东北、华南等二十个地区的销售单位积压的不合质量标准的汾酒和竹叶青酒就有十多万瓶。汾酒的质量下降，在经济上和政治上都造成了严重的损失。
    汾酒和竹叶青酒的质量为什么会下降呢？主要是由于制造厂——地方国营杏花村汾酒厂的领导人员对保持名酒质量采取了漫不经心的态度。
    汾酒所以能成为名酒，并不是偶然的。远在一千二百年前，我们的祖先就研究出了酿造汾酒的七条要素，代代相传，愈传愈精，后来又有了文字记载。解放后，我国的酒业专家们又经过分析研究，给予科学解说。
    制酒要素中提出：“人必得其精”，意思就是说，一个熟练的酿酒工人，不仅应知道怎样做酒，而且要知道为什么这样做。否则就不能算“得其精”，可是杏花村汾酒厂的领导人员，不但没有努力教育工人提高技术，使他们“得其精”，就是领导人员自己也不重视制酒技术的研究和学习。生产副厂长孙振世不知道什么是酿造汾酒的七条要素；亲自指挥生产的酿酒车间主任王明臣，竟连工人都背的烂熟的“六大标准”（酿酒业中普遍推行的先进经验）也不知道。
    制酒要素中说：“曲必得其时”。意思就是说要制造出好酒，就必须有好曲子。酿酒业是一种生物化学工业，它的整个生产过程，就是和细菌打交道的过程。曲子坏了，带入杂菌，不仅会使产量大减，而且会直接影响到酒的质量。杏花村汾酒厂的领导人员对这一点也很不重视。1954年就曾经由于曲子的质量不好，直接影响了酒的质量。今年以来，他们又在“为了提前完成计划”的借口下，缩短了曲子的发酵时间，甚至将质量低劣又着了雨的坏曲子当做好曲子投入了生产。
    制酒要素中说：“器具必得其洁”，这是一条非常宝贵的科学的经验，它说明我们的先人在一千二百年前就懂得了卫生的重要性，懂得了“文明生产”。可是杏花村汾酒厂的领导人员忽视了这一点，他们的曲子发酵房和蒸酒车间经常不打扫，在蒸酒原料中常常混入很多杂物。这怎能不降低酒的质量呢？
    提高汾酒质量，挽回汾酒的历史荣誉，是杏花村酒厂当前的重要任务，杏花村汾酒厂领导人员应该迅速采取措施来解决这个问题。
