Xinhua News Agency, May 21st: The National Petroleum Industry Advanced Producers Representative Conference closed in Beijing today.

The conference decided to further implement the spirit of the National Advanced Producers Representative Conference and carry out the advanced producer movement in the petroleum industry system in a deep and sustained manner.

The heads of administration and trade unions from fifty units in geological exploration, capital construction, and refining, who attended the meeting, signed contracts today on behalf of all employees of these units to carry out inter-factory and inter-trade competitions.

The more than three hundred advanced producer representatives who attended the meeting also put forward thirty-three proposals, suggesting that workers of the same trade in the national petroleum industry should earnestly promote the advanced experiences summarized at this meeting to raise the production level of the petroleum industry a step further.

Xinhua News Agency, May 21st: More than eighty major advanced experiences concerning accelerating the development of China's petroleum industry have been summarized and compiled at the National Petroleum Industry Advanced Producers Representative Conference, which closed today. These experiences are prepared to be widely promoted in all petroleum industrial enterprises across the country.

The safe and rapid experience created by the Wen Kuan Drilling Team of the Yumen Oilfield, which was summarized at this conference, can increase the footage of existing drilling rigs by 200,000 meters per year after being promoted in all petroleum drilling rigs across the country. This figure is more than the total footage of the petroleum industry system in the entire last year. The "different shale, different operating methods" created by the Zhang Tongyi team of Northeast Petroleum Plant No. 1 once enabled the team to produce an average of 5.6 tons more crude oil per shift than the previous shift. As long as this experience is adopted in the crude oil workshops of Northeast Petroleum Plant No. 1 and Petroleum Plant No. 2, it can increase the production of 7,500 tons of synthetic crude oil annually.

Among the advanced experiences that have been summarized and compiled, there are also many that have a significant impact on fully utilizing China's existing petroleum resources, improving oil quality, and ensuring production safety. For example, the formation hydraulic fracturing method adopted by the Yanchang Oilfield to increase production has increased the oil production of some wells by more than ten times compared to the past. After adopting this method, the oilfield's crude oil production in the last three years has approached the total oil production in the forty-odd years from the beginning of its exploitation to 1952. The experience of managing oil pipelines introduced by Liu Nai Kuan, an advanced producer of Northeast Petroleum Plant No. 1, has ensured that there have been no accidents such as oil spills or leaks in the oil pipelines managed by his team for six years.

    八十多项加速石油工业发展的先进经验将普遍推广
    据新华社21日讯　全国石油工业先进生产者代表会议今天在北京闭幕。
    会议决定进一步贯彻全国先进生产者代表会议精神，在石油工业系统中深入持久地开展先进生产者运动。
    出席这次会议的地质勘探、基本建设和炼油等方面的五十个单位的行政和工会的负责人，今天分别代表这些单位的全体职工在会上签订了开展厂际和同工种竞赛的合同。
    到会的三百多名先进生产者代表还分别提出了三十三项倡议，建议全国石油工业中的同工种工人，认真推广这次会议上总结的各项先进经验，把石油工业的生产水平提高一步。
    新华社21日讯　八十多项关于加速我国石油工业发展的重大先进经验，已经在今天闭幕的全国石油工业先进生产者代表会议上总结和整理出来。这些经验准备在全国所有的石油工业企业中普遍推广。
    这次会议上总结出来的玉门油矿田文宽钻井队创造的安全快速经验，在全国所有石油钻井的钻机中推广以后，每年可以使现有钻机增加二十万公尺的进尺，这个数字比石油工业系统去年全年的总进尺还多。东北石油一厂张同义班创造的“不同页岩、不同操作方法”，曾经使这个班平均每班产量比上一班多产五点六吨原油。这一经验只要在东北石油一厂和石油二厂的原油车间中采用，每年就能增产七千五百吨人造原油。
    在已经总结和整理出来的先进经验中，还有许多是对充分利用我国现有石油资源，提高油品质量和保证生产安全等方面有着重大作用的。其中如延长油田采用的地层水力压裂增产方法，使有些油井的产油量比过去提高了十几倍。这个油田在采用这一方法以后，最近三年来的原油产量接近了从开始开采到1952年为止的四十多年的产油总量。东北石油一厂先进生产者刘乃宽介绍的管理输油管的经验，曾经使他所在小组管理的输油管线上，六年中没有发生过一次跑油、漏油等事故。
