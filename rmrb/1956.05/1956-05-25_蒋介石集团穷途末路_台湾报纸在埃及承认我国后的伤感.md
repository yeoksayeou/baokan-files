Xinhua News Agency, May 24th: Following Egypt's recent recognition of the People's Republic of China, Taiwan newspapers have universally expressed greater pessimism and disappointment regarding the Chiang Kai-shek clique's dead end. An editorial in the "United Daily News" on May 18th stated that Egypt's action was "a crisis" for the Chiang Kai-shek clique, making the Chiang gang's so-called "diplomatic situation even more isolated and difficult than in the past." A news commentary in the "Central Daily News" on May 21st admitted that this was not only a "diplomatic setback" for the Chiang gang but also made the seat the Chiang gang had usurped in the United Nations even more precarious. An editorial in the "Kung Lun Pao" on May 19th stated that the Chiang Kai-shek clique's so-called "diplomatic status" was merely a "political football" that was "repeatedly manipulated by others." A commentary in the Keelung "Oriental Daily" on May 19th was even more pessimistic, saying that the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "failure this time is only the beginning, certainly not its end."

    蒋介石集团穷途末路
    台湾报纸在埃及承认我国后的伤感
    据新华社24日讯　在最近埃及承认中华人民共和国以后，台湾报纸普遍表示对蒋介石集团的穷途末路更加悲观失望。“联合报”五月十八日发表的社论说，埃及这一行动，对蒋介石集团是“一种危机”，使蒋帮的所谓“外交处境比过去更为寡困”。“中央日报”二十一日的新闻述评承认，这不但对蒋帮是一次“外交上的失利”，而且使蒋帮在联合国所窃踞的席位也发生更大的危险。“公论报”十九日的社论说，蒋介石集团的所谓“外交地位”，只是一个“被人反复播弄”的“政治皮球”。基隆“东方日报”五月十九日的评论更悲观地说，蒋介石集团的“这次失败还只是开始，绝不是它的结束”。
