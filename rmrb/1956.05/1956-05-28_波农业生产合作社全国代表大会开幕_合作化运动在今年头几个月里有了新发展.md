    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, May 27th. The Second National Congress of Polish Agricultural Production Cooperatives opened on the 26th at the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw. More than 2,700 delegates are participating in the congress.

    Polish Minister of Agriculture, Kuligowski, reported at the meeting that Poland now has more than 10,600 agricultural production cooperatives, with more than 220,000 farm households joining the cooperatives. The cooperativization movement has seen new development in the first few months of this year, with more newly established cooperatives and new members joining existing cooperatives than in the entire year of last year. In 1955, the unit area yield of many cooperatives exceeded that of individual farmers, with one-third of the cooperatives achieving a yield of more than 16 quintals per hectare for major grains. The number of collectively owned livestock in cooperatives has greatly increased compared to two years ago, with the number of cattle and pigs nearly doubling. Farm households participating in cooperatives received an average of approximately 3,200 zlotys (Polish currency) in cash and more than 20 quintals of grain last year, not including income from potatoes and private garden plots.

    Kuligowski also said in his report that this congress is being held in the first year of the Five-Year Plan. One of the main tasks of the Five-Year Plan is to greatly increase agricultural production in order to improve the living standards of our people. Our people expect cooperatives to take a leading role in this regard.

    波兰农业部长库利戈夫斯基在会上作报告说，波兰现在有一万零六百多个农业生产合作社，加入合作社的农户达到二十二万户以上。合作化运动在今年头几个月中有了新的开展，新成立的合作社和加入原有合作社的新社员都比去年全年还多。1955年，许多合作社的单位面积产量都超过了个体农民，有三分之一的合作社的主要谷物的产量每公顷超过了十六公担，合作社公有牲畜头数比两年前大大增加了，牛和猪的头数都增加了将近一倍。参加合作社的农户去年每户平均得到约三千二百兹罗提（波币名）现金和二十公担以上的谷物，马铃薯和宅旁园地上的收入还不计算在内。
    库利戈夫斯基在报告中还说，这次代表大会是在五年计划的第一年举行的。五年计划的主要任务之一是使农业生产大大提高以便提高我国人民的生活水平。我国人民期望合作社在这方面起带头作用。
