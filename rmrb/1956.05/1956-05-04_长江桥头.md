　　Yangtze River Bridgehead (Part 1)
    Special Correspondent of this Newspaper: Xu Chi
    There seems to be a hazy mist on the Yangtze River waves. In reality, that is water vapor. The closer to the water surface, the denser the water vapor.
    This is the news of the coming of spring. After only two consecutive hot days, the sky is already filled with rain clouds, and the water is evaporating like this. This makes it impossible to see the other shore at a glance. You might think you see a sea of clouds, but looking closely, you can vaguely see sailboats, wooden barges, steamers, and a busy river in the water vapor. You can see Wuchang and the pavilions on the towering Yellow Crane Tower, but if you look from the shore of Wuchang, you can see Hanyang and the Qingchuan Pavilion.
    From the gloomy sky, a narrow golden light shoots down where the clouds are sparse. In this beam of golden light, some golden navigational marks, three or four golden sails, and dozens of golden fishing boats returning with quick oars are swaying. Suddenly, a dense cloud of water vapor rises, covering everything again. At this time, you can hear various impatient sounds of different steam whistles, urgent and strange responses, howls and scoldings.
    Suddenly, some black figures emerge from the hazy water vapor, some strange, indescribable things, some solid, imposing, and huge structures, like islands in the clouds, or fleets in the misty sea. Counting them, there are eight in total.
    Are they really islands? Fleets? Or some mirages?
    They are actually wooden and iron barges loaded with construction materials, cranes with raised iron arms, gantry cranes, floating power plants, floating concrete factories, huge steel cofferdams, thick pipe columns, and all kinds of equipment never seen before, such as large drilling machines and vibration pile drivers. These machines, rotating, shaking, vibrating, exhaling gas, and spraying water. From there comes the clanging sound of steel, the roar of motors, and a heavy impact sound of "Ken Chi! Ken Chi!" that vibrates the great river, transmitted further by the water vapor. It turns out that this is a great socialist construction site.
    This, of course, can only be the construction site of the main bridge of the famous Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge.
    More than half a year has passed since the center of the bridge project—the main bridge—officially started construction in September 1955. Now the eight piers on the river are under intense construction simultaneously, attracting admiring eyes from people coming from all directions, and making the mighty Yangtze River feel narrow for the first time, even old sailors have to be extra cautious when passing through these waterways. But a poet from Wuhan said, all the bridge piers are being constructed at the same time, and the waterway can be kept from being cut off, which shows how vast and wide our Yangtze River, the great Yangtze River, is! The poet is right, this river is one of the few in the world. This project, however, is a unique project seen for the first time in the world.
    On a straight line of the bridge crossing, eight bridge piers are arranged in a row. Cofferdams have just been placed on pier No. 4, pipe columns are being placed on piers No. 3 and No. 7, holes are being drilled between the pipe columns on piers No. 5 and No. 6, piers No. 2 and No. 8 are about to emerge from the water surface, and pier No. 1 has been built out of the water surface in mid-February.
    For the time being, you don’t quite understand all of this. But as long as you see this construction site, you cannot help but be surprised. Because, just think about it, no matter how deep and rapid this mighty river is, it has already been conquered by our precise science. These piers under construction will soon all be built out of the water surface like pier No. 1, and then they will rise higher and higher, rising to a height that will surprise you (however, there will be more things that will surprise you later). Now you look up at that rainbow-like height. By the end of 1957, there will be a bridge like a treasure belt spanning this majestic river. The city of Wuhan will unfold under this rainbow. A permanent, beautiful rainbow! And pedestrians and vehicles will come and go in the air like this.
    But, in this air, look, the clouds are thicker. The sky is even gloomier. And the water vapor is even denser, gradually filling the entire space. Suddenly a flash of lightning appears. A few seconds later, thunder rumbles, getting closer and closer, and finally with a crack, the universe seems to explode. People nervously close windows, children cover their ears, women run around, collecting clothes drying in the wind. A gale arises, and in an instant, a torrential rain has poured down, mixed with large hailstones.
    The river is sealed!
    Water traffic on the river is cut off!
    The churning river waves heavily hit the bridge pier construction site.
    This is the first attack of the storm. It was a little after six o'clock in the afternoon at that time. Twenty minutes later, the gale and hailstorm, as if having played an overture, paused for a moment.
    The weather forecast issued by the meteorological station earlier was that there would be force seven winds at eight o'clock in the afternoon.
    At this time, black clouds filled the sky, only to be burned red by the fire of lightning, illuminating the dark water waves jumping.
    Before seven o'clock, the storm attacked more than an hour earlier. And the wind force quickly increased from force seven, force eight, force nine, and above force nine. The storm was unexpectedly fierce, and there was not a single pedestrian on the ground. The waves of the Yangtze River soared into the air.
    The gale danced on the river, chasing, searching for the victims it could bully.
    A jeep braved the wind, rain, thunder, and lightning, and drove out from in front of the bridge engineering bureau's building. It shot out two beams of light, but the light did not shine very far as if it was underwater. It seemed to be speeding underwater, all the way to construction site No. 5, to the bridge abutment below. Several dark shadows rushed up the embankment and plunged into the construction site captain's office.
    Right now, the people in the captain's office were in a bit of a mess, caught off guard. When they saw that it was the deputy director, Soviet experts, and the deputy chief engineer (the director and chief engineer were both in Beijing), they immediately fell silent. In their hearts, there was comfort.
    During the first attack of the storm, the leaders of the engineering bureau gathered in the dispatch room and used the dispatch telephone to check the various wind-prevention measures that had been arranged in advance—all of them had been implemented. But when the storm attacked again, they felt that the wind force exceeded expectations, being above force nine, and there might be difficulties at the bridgehead, so they came directly to the site.
    At this time, they took off their raincoats. The rainwater they brought in flowed along the wet ground to a lower corner.
    After understanding the situation, the deputy director began to assign tasks. This was almost exactly like a fierce battle. It was as if the enemy had already reached the door, surrounding you on all sides, and was using fierce firepower to attack you. Suddenly, the lights on pier No. 5 went out. It was as if a stronghold had been captured. But the deputy director, the experts, and the deputy chief engineer were all calm commanders who had grown up under fire and were experienced in battle. Although they were now fighting a major storm, they were still firmly confident. They assigned tasks to everyone present, and some comrades set off.
    The lights on pier No. 5 came back on in a flash. At that time, the deputy director was writing an order to be sent to construction site No. 4 by Secretary Gan Qiliang. But then the following situation was immediately discovered:
    A large crane ship parked next to pier No. 5 was an iron barge with a 35-ton crane on it. It was tied to the steel cofferdam with an 18mm steel wire rope. When the lights on pier No. 5 went out and it was pitch black all around, the howling gale suddenly grabbed the steel wire rope, pulling it, shaking it, and twisting it again and again, and breaking it like that. Then, it puffed out its cheeks and blew the large crane ship away from the pier, pushing it upstream against the current in an instant. When the people on pier No. 5 discovered it when the lights came on, it was already far away.
    The deputy director immediately issued an order by radio, instructing Zhang Kejie, the deputy captain of the No. 2 vessel, a well-known labor model on the construction site, to quickly organize forces to rescue it.
    While Gan Qiliang was ordered to go to construction site No. 4, the No. 2 vessel at the construction site transportation river mouth had already started its engines and set off into the major storm. Gan Qiliang saw the three-color lights on the mast moving forward while rocking and swaying. They sparkled like gems, no matter how dark and dangerous the night was.
    At this time, the large crane ship had been blown far upstream by the wind against the rapids. And the experienced sailors on the No. 2 vessel—they had carried out rescue work in the Yangtze River winds and waves more than once, but had rarely encountered winds above force nine—were driving fast in the big waves, as if they were climbing over mountains and ridges, and soon caught up with the large crane ship. Zhang Kejie steered the large vessel and approached it cautiously and with difficulty. As if he did not acknowledge there was a major storm at all, the crew members used steel wire ropes to tie the large crane ship tightly.
    At the same time, the steel wire rope on the large crane ship next to pier No. 2 was also broken by the gale. This 35-ton large crane ship was usually very majestic. It suffered because it had no engine or rudder of its own, and usually relied on tugboats and barges. At this time, it could only be manipulated by the gale. Now it was also moving in the upstream direction against the rapids.
    The people on pier No. 2 immediately discovered it and called for help, worrying that the crane ship would crash into pier No. 1. But it just grazed past the side of pier No. 1, as it was relatively close to the left bank. The wind gradually blew it towards the shore.
    The deputy director ordered Team One to prepare for rescue, because without waiting for his order, Team Leader Shi Jingren had already flashed out. This was an old worker with a chin full of gray and white short whiskers, old, but his eyes shining. He grabbed a foreman by the shoulder, pulled him over, and told him that there was a coil of 25mm steel wire rope below bridge abutment No. 3, and quickly send someone to carry it over. Several dark shadows dashed off.
    Some people were still anxious, some people knitted their brows in worry, but Team Leader Shi had a look of confidence on his face. He waited quietly for the steel wire rope. He did not know that the deputy director was watching him and was flashing through such thoughts: Should this old man be allowed to run out in the wind and rain? Should he be stopped? But it would not work without someone with his experience coming forward. The situation was urgent.
    This experienced person knew that the wind direction and water flow would make the crane ship lean against the shoal on the left bank. The steel wire rope, coiled into a ball like a giant python, was carried to the embankment. More than twenty people, like carrying a dragon lantern, carried the steel wire rope on their shoulders, lined up in a long line.
    Team Leader Shi kept shouting, directing everyone, starting to move from the embankment where the wind was blowing so hard that people could not stand still or straight. They rushed down the slope from the high stone steps on the bank.
    The Hanyang shore was rising rapidly, and they descended to the water's edge, with the people behind him following him.
    They kept running to the beach. From the lightning, they saw that the crane ship was already close to the left bank ahead. Looking again, they saw that the waves were higher than two people. But with the receding waves, holding the steel wire rope tightly, they quickly waded to the vicinity of the crane ship, and finally sent the steel wire rope onto the crane ship. They tied the crane ship on the shore where the sea-like spray was flying.
    At the same time, in the pitch-black heart of the river, with giant waves rising and falling, an order was issued on the No. 2 vessel:
    "Drop anchor!"
    The anchor was dropped. But even with the anchor dropped, it was useless. The gale continued to push the crane ship upstream. The No. 2 vessel, dragging its anchor, did everything it could to embrace the crane ship, protecting it, letting the two of them move slowly together. In the gale and torrential rain, they had unknowingly arrived near Nianyu Tao.
    The wind blew for most of the night, and the construction site was tense for most of the night.
    At two o'clock in the second half of the night, the wind force weakened slightly. Gan Qiliang and the others drove a steamer and sailed to the vicinity of the bridge piers. They started from pier No. 1 and inspected them one by one, all the way to pier No. 8. The wind was slightly smaller, but the waves were still very big. People on the ship felt a little dizzy and nauseous. The steamer rose and fell, and it was impossible to get close to the piers.
    They turned on a strong light and shone it on each pier, looking at them from a distance. Although the slanting wind, heavy rain, and river waves seen in the light were still terrifying, they saw that the pipe columns, steel cofferdams, etc. on the bridge piers stood still. They also saw the people guarding on the bridge piers. These people only felt that the night was unusually cool. They had not yet felt any slight tremors in the place where they were standing, sitting, and lying. These eight bridge piers did not pay attention to the wind and waves.

　　长江桥头（上篇）
    本报特约记者　徐迟
    长江浪涛上，似乎有白蒙蒙的雾气的样子。实际上，那却是水气。愈近水面，水气愈浓。
    这是春天正在到来的音讯，只一连热了两天，天空中便已布满雨云，而水上便蒸发得这样。这使你一眼望去，此岸望不到彼岸。你以为你看见的是一片云海，可是再仔细看看，水气中隐隐约约地出现了帆船、木驳、汽轮，出现了一条忙忙碌碌的江。你能看到武昌和高耸的黄鹤楼上的楼阁，而如果你是从武昌的岸上看过来的，看见的可是汉阳和晴川阁了。
    从阴沉沉的上空，云稀处，这时也射下了一道狭窄的金光。这道金光里，摇晃着一些金色的航标，三四片金帆和数十条快棹归来的金色的渔舟。突然一阵浓密的水气升起，又把一切都掩没了。这时，能够听见各种不同的汽笛声焦躁地响起来，急促、古怪的呼应，叫啸和叱责。
    一忽儿，从白蒙蒙的水气中间又浮现出一些黑色的形象来，一些奇异的，无法形容的事物，一些坚固、威武而巨大的结构，好像是云霞中的岛屿，或者是雾海中的舰队。数它们一数，一共是八座。
    它们果真是岛屿？舰队？还是什么海市蜃楼？
    它们原来是一些满载着建设材料的木驳、铁驳，高举着铁臂的起重吊船，龙门架，水上发电厂，水上混凝土工厂，巨大的钢结构的围令，粗大的管柱群以及一切从来也没有看见过的机具，如大型钻探机，震动打桩机等。这些机具，旋转的、摇动的、震动的，吐着气，喷着水。从那里传出钢铁叮当声，马达轰响声，还有一种震动大江的“啃嗤！啃嗤！”的沉重的冲击声，因水气而传送得更远。原来，这是一个伟大的社会主义建设工地。
    这当然只能是著名的武汉长江大桥的正桥工地。
    自从1955年的9月，大桥工程的中心——正桥——宣布开工到现在，已经过去半年多了。现在江上的八座桥墩正在同时紧张施工，使从四面八方来的人们投以惊羡的眼光，使浩荡的长江第一次感觉到航道狭窄，连老水手在经过这些航道的时候都要加倍谨慎。但是也有武汉的一位诗人说，全部桥墩同时施工，而航道可以不被切断，可见我们的长江，伟大的长江，多末浩瀚和宽阔啊！诗人的话是对的，这江是世上少有的江。这工程，可是世上第一次看到的、独创的工程。
    在桥渡线的一条直线上，八座桥墩一字排开。四号墩刚下围令，三号和七号墩正下管柱，五号和六号墩正在管柱中间钻孔，二号和八号墩快出水面了，一号墩则在二月中已经修出了水面。
    暂时你对于这一些还是不很理解的。可是只要你看到这工地，你是不能不吃惊的。因为，请想一想，无论这条浩浩荡荡的江是怎样的水深流急，竟已经被我们用精确的科学制服得服服贴贴了。这些正在施工的桥墩，将如一号墩似的很快地全部都修出水面来，然后它们将向高处上升，越来越升高，升高到一个使你吃惊的高度（不过，往后使你吃惊的事还多着呢）。现在你仰起脖子，看那天虹般的高度吧。1957年底，那里将有一条宝带似的大桥横跨过这条雄伟的江。武汉市将展开在这道天虹之下。永久的，美丽的虹！而行人车马就将这样凌空来往。
    可是，在这空中，你看，云更浓了。天色更加阴悒了。而水气也更浓了，渐渐地迷漫了整个空间。突然闪出一道电火。几秒钟后，传来隆隆的雷声，愈来愈近，最后霹雳一声，宇宙好像炸裂了。人们紧张地关窗户，孩子们按着耳朵，妇女们奔走，把晾在风中飞舞的衣服收起。狂风大作，一瞬间，暴雨已经倾泻下来，还夹杂着大颗粒的冰雹。
    封江了！
    江上交通断绝了！
    翻动的江浪重重地打击着桥墩工地。
    这是风暴的第一次袭击。那时是下午六点多。二十分钟以后，狂风和雹雨，好像奏完了一个序曲一样，停歇了一下。
    早先气象台发出的天气预报是下午八点将有七级风。
    这时候，黑云迷漫，只被闪电的火光将它烧红，照见阴暗的水波在跳跃。
    没有到七点，风暴提前了一小时多，再次袭来。而且风力迅速由七级、八级、九级而九级以上。风暴出乎意料之外的凶恶，吹得大地上一个行人也没有了。长江的浪涛，飞腾到空中。
    狂风在江上飞舞，追逐着，寻找着它可以欺凌的牺牲品。
    一辆吉普车冒着风雨雷电，从大桥工程局的大楼前开出。它射出两道灯光，灯光也像在水底一样射不很远。它像在水底飞驰，一直到五号工地，到桥台下面。几个黑影奔上大堤，扑进工地队长室。
    正好队长室里的一屋子人，在措手不及的情况下，有一点乱糟糟呢。他们一看到进来的是副局长、苏联专家和副总工程师（局长和总工程师都在北京），立刻鸦雀无声。在他们的心里，有了安慰。
    在暴风雨第一次袭击的时候，工程局的领导就集中到调度室，用调度电话检查了原先布置的各项防风措施——都执行了。但是，等暴风雨再次袭击的时候，他们就感到，风力超过预期，在九级以上，桥头可能会有困难，就直接来到现场。
    这时，他们脱下了雨衣。他们带进来的雨水沿着润湿的地面流到一个较低的角落去。
    了解情况后，副局长开始分配工作。这几乎和一场激烈的战斗完全相同。这好像敌人已经打到门口，四面将你围住，正用炽威的火力向你猛攻。突然，五号墩上灯火灭了。好像一个据点被夺。但是副局长、专家，副总工程师都是在炮火之下成长，久经战斗的沉着的指挥员，虽然现在是和大风暴作战，他们还是信心坚定的。给在场的人一一分配了任务，一部分同志就出发了。
    五号墩一忽儿就灯火复明了。那时，副局长正在写一道命令，要甘其良书记送到四号工地去。可是立刻发现了这样的情况：
    停泊在五号墩旁边的一艘大吊船，是上面有一台三十五吨吊车的铁驳。它是用一条十八公厘的钢丝绳栓住在钢围堰上的。在五号墩灯灭，四周墨黑之中，嗥叫着的狂风突然攫住了钢丝绳，一下又一下地拉它、摇它、拧它，就这样把它摔断了。然后，它鼓起了两腮，把这样大的吊船吹离了桥墩，吹动了它，一下子逆着水流把它向上游推送。五号墩上的人在灯亮发现时，它已走远了。
    副局长立刻用无线电发布了命令，要二号轮副轮长张克杰，工地上一位著名的劳动模范，赶紧组织力量，前去抢救。
    在甘其良奉命向四号工地去的时候，在工地运输河口的二号轮已经升火向大风暴中开去。甘其良看见桅杆上的三色灯光在摇幌前进。它们宝石似地闪耀着，不管夜多么墨黑和凶险。
    这时大吊船已经被风顶着激流，吹到上游很远处。而二号轮上的有经验的水手们——他们不止一次在长江风浪中进行过抢救工作，不过九级以上的风很少遇到——在大浪中，翻山越岭似地开着快车，不多久就追上大吊船。张克杰撑着大轮，谨慎而困难地靠拢了它。好像就不承认有大风暴似的，船员们用钢丝绳把大吊船紧紧栓住。
    在这同时，二号墩旁边的大吊船上的钢丝绳也给狂风拉断了。这种三十五吨大吊船平素威风凛凛。它就是吃这一点亏，自己既没有机器，也没有舵，平日靠轮船拖驳，这时只能让狂风摆弄。现在它也顶着激流，向上游的方向移动。
    二号墩上的人立刻发现，打电话呼救。耽心那吊船撞上一号墩。但它刚从一号墩边上擦了过去，它是比较地靠近左岸的。风把它渐渐吹向岸边。
    副局长下令一中队准备抢救，因为还没有等他命令，一中队长石景仁早已闪了出来。这是一位满下巴都是灰白的短须，苍老，但两眼却发光的老工人。他抓住一个工长的肩膀，拉他过来，告诉他，在三号桥台下面，有着一盘二十五公厘的钢丝绳，赶紧派人去抬来。几个黑影飞奔而去。
    有的人还在干着急，有的人结起了愁眉，而石队长满脸都是有把握的神色，他安详地等着钢丝绳。他不知道副局长正看着他，并且正闪过这样的思想：是不是让这老人冒着风雨跑出去呢？要不要阻止他呢？但没有他这样有经验的人出马又不行。情况是紧急的。
    这有经验的人，知道风向和水流将使吊船靠上左岸的那一块滩。像一条巨蟒似的盘成一团的钢丝绳被抬到堤上了。二十多人，像舞龙灯似的把钢丝绳抬在肩膀上，排成一长行。
    石队长不断地叫着，指挥着大家，从那被风吹得人站不住、站不直的堤上开始行动。他们从岸边高高的石级，急行下坡去。
    汉阳岸急速地上升，他们下降到水边，后面的人跟着他。
    他们一直奔到沙滩上。从闪电中看到吊船已经靠近前面的左岸。再一看，才看到浪掀将起来，比两个多人还高。可是随着退下去的浪，紧握着钢丝绳，他们急速地涉水到吊船附近，最后把钢丝绳送上吊船。他们在海浪似的水花飞溅的岸边把吊船栓住了。
    就在这时，在墨黑的江心，巨浪上下，二号轮上命令：
    “下锚！”
    锚下去了。可是下了锚也不顶事，大风继续把吊船往上游推，二号轮拖着它的锚，用尽一切办法，拥抱着吊船，保护着它，让它们俩一同缓缓地移动，在狂风暴雨中，他们不觉已来到了鲶鱼套附近了。
    风吹了大半夜，工地上紧张了大半夜。
    后半夜两点，风势稍煞。甘其良他们驾驶着一条汽轮，驶到桥墩附近。他们从一号墩开始，一个一个地检查了一遍，直到八号墩。风稍小，可是浪还很大。人在轮船上，有点晕眩，有点恶心。汽轮一起一伏，也无法靠近墩子。
    他们开亮了一盏强光灯，照住一个个墩子，远远看去。虽然灯光中所见的斜风、急雨、江浪仍然可怕，可是他们看到桥墩上的管柱群，钢围堰等等，屹立不动。他们也看到守在桥墩上的人、这些人只是觉得这一夜怪凉快的。他们还没有感觉到他们站立和坐卧的地方，有任何轻微的震动。这八座桥墩才不理会那风浪呢。
