　　Socialist Competition is a Powerful Force for Developing China's Socialist Economy
    Gu Dachun Liu Shi
    We must, within a not-too-long period, build our country into a powerful, socialist, industrialized nation, bringing our economy and science and technology close to, or even reaching, the advanced levels of the world. This requires us to rapidly increase labor productivity.
    We know that the growth of labor productivity depends on more developed production techniques and more perfected labor organization, and these factors ultimately depend on people. Because all machines and tools are created by the working people and controlled by the working people, and all labor organizations are different forms of combination of the working people in the production process. Therefore, the working people's attitude towards labor and the degree of their enthusiasm for labor greatly affects the growth of labor productivity.
    Since liberation, China's working class has fully demonstrated its socialist enthusiasm in all aspects, and this enthusiasm is concentratedly manifested in the socialist competitions carried out over the years. Socialist competition is an important method for improving production and increasing labor productivity on the basis of the working people exerting their greatest enthusiasm.
    Socialist competition reflects the new labor attitude of the Chinese working people under the new relations of production. In China's state-owned enterprises and cooperative enterprises, exploitation has been eliminated. In private enterprises and state-capitalist enterprises, exploitation has been greatly restricted and is rapidly moving towards the final elimination of exploitation. China's working class is working for the prosperity and strength of their country, for the development of their collective cause, and for their own happy life. Because the position of the working class in production has undergone a fundamental change, the nature of labor has also undergone a fundamental change. Since the labor of China's working class is to create a material foundation for the happy life of the Chinese people, labor has become a respected activity and a glorious and conscious undertaking. However, this conscious labor attitude can only be more and more deeply embodied in people's labor practice.
    The great role of socialist competition is first manifested in its being the most practical communist education for the working people. It cultivates the vast number of employees to treat labor with a communist attitude and inspires the vast number of employees to deeply care about production and the improvement of labor productivity. In recent years, the vast number of employees have launched movements to donate equipment, create new records, patriotic labor competitions, campaigns to increase production and practice economy, technical innovation movements, and comprehensive economy movements. Recently, encouraged by the upsurge of socialist transformation in urban and rural areas, the advanced producer movement has been widely launched. In the entire process of competition development, employees have increasingly improved their socialist awareness. They have increasingly clearly recognized the consistency of personal interests and national interests; they have increasingly clearly recognized that the funds for building socialism must be accumulated bit by bit by their own labor; they have increasingly clearly recognized that to accelerate socialist construction, it is not only necessary to learn new technologies and master new technologies, but also to continuously improve technologies and improve technologies. They consciously abide by labor discipline, cherish every minute and second of working hours, try their best to improve product quality, and use tools, fuel, raw materials, and materials economically, promoting the increase of labor productivity in many ways.
    The great role of competition is also manifested in mass, realistic criticism and self-criticism. This mass criticism and self-criticism is a powerful driving force for continuously improving production. It expresses the contradiction between new and old things in China's industrial production, and relies on the creativity and initiative of the vast number of employees to overcome the obstacles of old things, thereby greatly improving labor productivity. The vast number of employees in China realize that improving production is the prerequisite for improving life. Therefore, they will never be satisfied with the production achievements already achieved. In their labor practice, they constantly discover and search for possibilities to improve technology, improve production organization, and improve labor organization. The initiatives of advanced producers concentratedly express this spirit of production innovation of the vast number of employees. Each stage of development of competition in China is first initiated by advanced producers before it becomes a mass movement. With the development of competition, there are more and more advanced producers, and the initiatives they put forward are becoming more and more profound. The more people who respond to these initiatives, the faster the movement develops. Under the leadership of advanced producers, the vast number of employees in China are constantly breaking through old quotas, creating new and advanced quotas, and enabling production plans to be overfulfilled ahead of schedule.
    Recognizing this characteristic of competition requires us to be good at developing the enthusiasm of the masses, supporting the initiatives of advanced workers, and adopting criticisms and suggestions from below. For example, the leadership of the 53 Factory realized that production plans should reflect the enthusiasm of the employees. Therefore, when conducting production planning this year, they widely carried out mass criticism and self-criticism, and adopted a new method of "organized, bottom-up tapping of enterprise potential, layer-by-layer planning, and step-by-step balancing" to formulate the plan. As a result of the planning, the original plan to complete the Five-Year Plan nine months ahead of schedule can now be completed one year and forty-six days ahead of schedule; at the same time, costs can be reduced by 16.3%, while the original estimate was only a 5.6% reduction. In contrast to the practice of the 53 Factory, the Shenyang Chemical Plant adopted a method of restricting the enthusiasm of the masses. This year, the state requires the plant to increase the production of "666" powder by 73% on the basis of last year's actual output. The plant's leadership believes that only by increasing equipment can the task be completed, so they drafted two plans to expand equipment. However, Wang Jinyuan, the director of the 514 workshop producing "666" powder and a labor model, after calculating the existing production capacity of the workshop and jointly researching with technician Zhu Yuyao, believed that as long as the original operating procedures are improved, more than 3,000 tons of "666" powder can be produced in one year. However, the leadership suspected the initiative of Wang Jinyuan and others, and attempted to "persuade him." In fact, if the initiative of Wang Jinyuan and others is realized, it can exceed the requirements of the national plan, and the second plan to expand equipment is completely unnecessary.
    In our enterprises, there is a universal struggle between the two roads of advancement and conservatism. Organizing competition is the correct path to use the weapons of criticism and self-criticism, overcome the obstacles of right-leaning conservative thinking, promote the creativity and initiative of the vast number of employees, and strive to improve labor productivity.
    The great role of socialist competition is also manifested in its embodiment of the relationship of socialist comradely cooperation in our country. The basic principle of socialist competition is to help each other, learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses, and improve together. Organizing competition is to enable the majority of people to learn and master the experience of advanced producers, and to use advanced methods for labor. Organizing competition is to organize advanced producers or units to help backward producers or units, so that they can all be brought to an advanced level. That is to say: the main point of socialist competition is to promote advanced experience. We cannot understand socialist competition as a comparison of "survival of the fittest." Because the so-called "survival of the fittest" essentially reflects the capitalist principle of competition, which is a life-and-death struggle carried out by capitalists to expand their sphere of influence and compete for the market, and is an inevitable consequence under the evil capitalist system. Since socialist competition is mutual assistance and cooperation in the labor process of employees for common interests, it can promote the vast number of employees to show a high degree of communist moral character. The slogan of socialist competition can only be: the backward learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced; the advanced help the backward catch up with themselves, and at the same time, strive to make themselves more progressive. Because competition embodies the principle of socialist comradely cooperation, it can universally improve labor productivity.
    Now, we should admit that advanced figures in the highway transportation industry, such as Ai Zhaochang and Ge Zhengzhong, cannot be measured by their personal production achievements. After their experience in saving fuel was mastered by the vast number of employees, these experiences were further enriched and supplemented, and developed into the "safe, economical, 100,000-kilometer no major overhaul movement." This movement is changing the backward state of China's highway transportation industry. From here, it can be clearly seen that organizing competition must tightly grasp the main link of promoting advanced experience. Continuously spreading advanced experience can make competition a lively cause and achieve remarkable results.
    It is precisely because competition can bring into play its roles of communist education, mass criticism and self-criticism, and socialist comradely mutual assistance and cooperation, and these roles are interconnected and mutually promoted, that it can become a huge driving force for improving labor productivity.
    Socialist competition is the will and desire of the vast number of employees to improve production, and it is initiated by the vast number of employees from the bottom up. However, it must not be thought that competition can be carried out spontaneously. China's socialist competition has developed under the leadership and support of the Party, the government, trade union organizations, and the Communist Youth League. In the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of our Party, it was pointed out that we must wholeheartedly rely on the working class to restore and develop production. This instruction of the Party has become the fundamental guideline in our urban work and economic work. In order to adhere to this guideline, the Party has been constantly fighting. In each period, the Party has openly and in detail explained to all employees the situation facing our country, and pointed out the direction of progress and specific tasks. The Party has carried out extensive and profound communist education among the vast number of employees, and constantly educated employees to fight against capitalist ideas. Constantly exposing and criticizing bureaucrats who are divorced from the masses and hinder the growth of new things, and supporting every new initiative of the working people with the greatest care. All of this has helped China's socialist competition to continuously expand and deepen. In order to give full play to the role of competition, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership over competition and continuously improve the leadership level of competition.
    Leading competition work is to open up a path for the smooth development of competition and create favorable conditions for participants in the competition to show their talents in the competition. However, not all enterprise leaders now understand the great role of socialist competition. They have not regarded organizing competition as their own responsibility, but only as the responsibility of the trade union organization. They have such a saying: "I am in charge of administrative management, and you are in charge of competition." There are even some enterprise leaders who not only do not actively support the initiatives of the masses and create favorable conditions for realizing these initiatives, but instead take many restrictive measures and require the masses to act according to the specifications they have formulated in advance. For example, production meetings were originally a forum for the masses. They should promote the employees' initiative in production and implement bottom-up mass supervision. Because supporting mass bottom-up supervision can inspire the vast number of employees' sense of ownership, thereby making employees more actively expose the shortcomings in production. However, some enterprise leaders only regard production meetings as their own forum, replacing mass criticism and self-criticism with lengthy lectures.
    Cultivating advanced producers is a very important thing, but some of our enterprise leaders are satisfied with having one or two outstanding figures, and adopt an attitude of "never entering their doors" towards the backward. Since they regard cultivating advanced producers as the ultimate goal, they do not seriously summarize the experience of advanced workers, do not realistically promote these experiences, and do not carefully understand the difficulties of the backward and help them have the necessary conditions for learning advanced experience. As a result, the advanced and the backward are set against each other, and the advanced are isolated.
    Constantly guiding the masses to improve technology, improve production organization and labor organization, attract the masses to put forward rationalization proposals, and promptly adopt employees' suggestions can ensure that labor productivity is continuously improved and that the state plan is completed ahead of schedule. However, some enterprise leaders are accustomed to using the method of layer-by-layer supervision and working overtime when they find that the state plan has not been completed, which often increases equipment accidents and work-related injuries, overspends the wage fund, and reduces product quality, causing significant losses in production.
    Socialist competition is generated under the action of the basic socialist economic law. The requirements of the basic socialist economic law are, simply and popularly speaking, to develop production and guarantee needs. Developing production is the means, and guaranteeing needs is the goal. According to this basic economic law, our Party has put forward the policy of "gradually improving the lives of employees on the basis of developing production and improving labor productivity." This policy must be seriously implemented so that the vast number of employees can work energetically and with full enthusiasm. Caring for people and people's needs is a very important thing in leading competition work. However, some of our trade union workers and enterprise leaders often forget to care for people. They do not use the huge possibilities given to them by the state to improve workers' working conditions and living conditions. In the name of "saving," they reduce the funding for necessary labor protection facilities and reasonable welfare facilities, improperly "save" wage funds, and even take obviously illegal means to treat workers. These practices blur the purpose of production and dampen the enthusiasm of the masses for labor.
    The principle of material encouragement embodies the unity of socialist public interests and individual interests. Implementing a correct wage and reward system can materially encourage the advanced and promote the backward to catch up with the advanced, which is one of the important conditions for organizing competition. However, some leaders believe that mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses can only rely on political education, while material encouragement will guide workers to develop "individualism" or "economism." Undoubtedly, political education has been, is, and will be an extremely important means for us to mobilize the masses. However, our political education cannot be separated from the laws of social material life. On the contrary, it must be able to correctly explain material life and be proven by the actual development of material life. The great persuasive effect of our political education lies in this. The reason why China's working class has paid unparalleled enthusiasm for accelerating socialist construction is because from the life experience since liberation, they deeply believe that building socialism and entering communism will bring a better life. Political education and material encouragement should not be opposed, but must be combined to improve the communist awareness of the masses from the care for the material interests of the masses.
    China's socialist construction and socialist transformation are proceeding rapidly, new enterprises are being put into production one after another, and the original enterprises are gradually implementing technological transformation. With the high tide of economic construction, a cultural upsurge is being set off among the vast number of employees, and the material lives of workers are also constantly improving. All of this creates extremely favorable conditions for the development of socialist competition in our country. The current problem is that we must overcome the right-leaning conservative thinking of the leadership, rely on the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, strengthen the leadership of the competition, ensure that the socialist competition continues to rise, and enable it to effectively play the role of a powerful driving force for accelerating China's industrial construction.

　　社会主义竞赛是发展我国社会主义经济的强大动力
    顾大椿  刘实
    我们要在一个不很长的时间内，把我国建成一个强大的社会主义工业化的国家，使我国在经济上、科学技术上接近或者达到世界的先进水平。这就要求我们迅速提高劳动生产率。
    我们知道，劳动生产率的增长取决于更加发展的生产技术和更加完善的劳动组织，而这些因素最后又决定于人。因为一切机器、工具都是劳动人民所创造并且由劳动人民来掌握的，一切劳动组织都是劳动人民在生产过程中不同形式的结合。所以，劳动人民对劳动的态度，对劳动的积极性的程度，就在极大的程度上影响着劳动生产率的增长。
    解放以来，我国工人阶级在各个方面充分地表现了社会主义积极性，这种积极性集中地表现在历年所开展的社会主义竞赛中。社会主义竞赛正是在劳动人民发挥最大积极性的基础上改善生产和提高劳动生产率的重要方法。
    社会主义竞赛反映着我国劳动人民在新的生产关系下的新的劳动态度。在我国国营企业和合作社企业中，已经消灭了剥削，在私营企业和国家资本主义企业中，已经大大限制了剥削并且正在迅速走向最后消灭剥削的途径，我国的工人阶级是为了自己国家的繁荣富强、为了自己的集体事业的发展、为了自己过幸福的生活而劳动。正因为工人阶级在生产中的地位起了根本的变化，所以劳动的性质也随着起了根本的变化。我国工人阶级的劳动既然是为我国人民的幸福生活创立物质基础，劳动就成为受人尊敬的行为，成为一种光荣的自觉的事业。但是这种自觉的劳动态度只有在人们劳动实践中才能愈来愈深刻地体现出来。
    社会主义竞赛的巨大作用首先表现在它对劳动人民是最实际的共产主义教育。它培养广大职工以共产主义态度对待劳动，激发广大职工深切地关心生产，关心劳动生产率的提高。几年来，广大职工开展了献纳器材运动、创造新纪录运动、爱国主义劳动竞赛、增产节约运动、技术革新运动和全面节约运动，最近，更由于城乡社会主义改造高潮的鼓舞，广泛地开展了先进生产者运动。在整个竞赛发展的过程中，职工日益提高了社会主义觉悟。他们愈来愈清楚地认识了个人利益和国家利益的一致性；愈来愈清楚地认识到，建设社会主义的资金要靠自己的劳动一点一滴地积累而来；愈来愈清楚地认识到，要加速社会主义建设，不仅要学习新技术、掌握新技术，而且要不断地改进技术、提高技术。他们自觉地遵守劳动纪律，爱惜一分一秒的工时，尽力改善产品质量，节约地使用工具、燃料、原料和材料，从多方面促使劳动生产率的提高。
    竞赛的巨大作用，还表现在群众性的实事求是的批评和自我批评。这种群众性的批评和自我批评是不断改进生产的强大动力。它表现了我国工业生产中新生事物与旧事物之间的矛盾，并且依靠广大职工的创造性和主动精神，来克服旧事物的阻碍，从而大大提高劳动生产率。我国的广大职工认识到提高生产是改善生活的前提，因此，他们永远不会满足于已经达到的生产成就，他们在劳动实践中，不断地发现和寻找改进技术、改善生产组织和劳动组织的可能性。集中地表现广大职工群众的这种生产革新精神的就是先进生产者的创举。我国竞赛发展的各个时期都是首先由先进生产者提出倡议，而后才成为一个群众运动。随着竞赛的发展，先进生产者愈来愈多，他们所提出的倡议就愈具有深刻的内容。响应这些倡议的人也越多，运动开展的也就越迅速。我国广大职工在先进生产者带动下，不断地突破旧的定额，创造新的、先进的定额，使生产计划超额的提前的完成。
    认识竞赛的这一特点，就是要我们善于发挥群众的积极性，支持先进者的创举，采纳来自下面的批评和建议。例如，五三工厂的领导方面认识到生产计划应该体现职工群众的积极性，因此在今年进行生产规划时，广泛开展了群众性的批评和自我批评，采取了“有领导的、自下而上的挖掘企业潜力、层层规划、逐级平衡”的新方法来制定规划。规划结果，原预定提前九个月完成五年计划，现在可以提前一年零四十六天完成五年计划；同时，成本可以降低16.3％，而原先预计只可以降低5.6％。与五三工厂的做法相反，沈阳化工厂却采取了限制群众积极性的办法。今年，国家要求这个厂在去年的实际产量基础上再把“六六六”药粉产量提高73％，这个厂领导方面认为只有增加设备才能完成任务，于是拟订了两次扩充设备计划。而该厂生产“六六六”药粉的五一四车间主任、劳动模范王金元在计算了车间现有生产能力并和技术员朱玉瑶共同研究后，认为只要改进原有操作规程，一年就可以增产“六六六”药粉三千多吨。但是领导方面怀疑王金元等的倡议，企图“说服他”。事实上，如果实现王金元等的倡议，就可以超过国家计划的要求，第二次扩充设备计划是完全不必要的。
    在我们的企业里，普遍地存在着这种先进和保守的两条道路的斗争。组织竞赛，这就是运用批评和自我批评的武器，克服右倾保守思想的阻碍，发扬广大职工的创造性和主动精神，为提高劳动生产率而斗争的正确道路。
    社会主义竞赛巨大的作用还表现在它体现了我国社会主义的同志合作的关系。社会主义竞赛的基本原则就是互相帮助、互相学习，取长补短、共同提高。组织竞赛就是要使大多数人学习和掌握先进生产者的经验，都用先进的方法进行劳动。组织竞赛就是要组织先进的生产者或单位帮助落后的生产者或单位，使他们都能提到先进的水平。这也就是说：社会主义竞赛的主要之点就是推广先进经验。我们不能把社会主义竞赛理解为评比“优胜劣败”。因为所谓“优胜劣败”实质上就是反映了资本主义的竞争原则，是资本家为了扩大势力范围、争夺市场而进行的你死我活的斗争，是罪恶的资本主义制度下不可避免的后果。社会主义竞赛既然是职工为了共同利益在劳动过程中的互助合作，它就能够促使广大职工表现出高度的共产主义道德品质。社会主义竞赛的口号只能是：落后者向先进者学习，并且赶上先进者；先进者帮助落后者赶上自己，同时，力求自己更加进步。正因为竞赛体现了社会主义同志合作的原则，所以才能普遍地提高劳动生产率。
    现在，我们应该承认，像艾肇昌、葛正中等公路运输业中的先进人物，是不能以他们个人的生产成绩来衡量他们的作用的。他们的节约用油的经验在被广大职工掌握之后，进一步丰富和充实了这些经验，发展成为“安全、节约、十万公里无大修运动”。这个运动正在改变着我国公路运输业的落后状态。从这里就可以清楚地看到，组织竞赛必须紧紧地掌握住推广先进经验这个主要的环节。不断地传播先进经验，就能使竞赛成为生气勃勃的事业而且效果显著。
    正由于竞赛能够发挥出它的共产主义教育、群众性的批评和自我批评和社会主义同志般的互助合作的作用，而且这些作用是互相联贯的、互相推动的，才能成为提高劳动生产率的巨大的动力。
    社会主义竞赛是广大职工群众提高生产的意志和愿望，它是由广大职工自下而上发起的。但是，绝不能认为竞赛可以自流地进行。我国的社会主义竞赛就是在党、政府、工会组织和青年团的领导和支持下发展起来的。我们党在七届二中全会决议中曾指出：必须全心全意依靠工人阶级，恢复和发展生产。党的这一指示就成为我们城市工作和经济工作中的根本方针。党为了坚持这个方针，不断地进行着斗争。党在各个时期都公开而详尽地向全体职工说明了我们的国家所面临的形势，并且指出前进的方向和具体的任务。党在广大职工中进行了广泛而深刻的共产主义教育工作，不断地教育职工同资本主义思想进行斗争。不断地揭露和批评脱离群众的、阻碍新鲜事物生长的官僚主义者，以最大的关怀来支持劳动人民的每一个新的创举。所有这一切，都帮助我国的社会主义竞赛不断地扩大和深入。为了充分发挥竞赛的作用，就必须加强党对竞赛的领导，不断地提高竞赛的领导水平。
    领导竞赛工作就是为竞赛开辟顺利发展的道路，为竞赛参加者在竞赛中显示自己的才能创造有利条件。但是，现在还不是所有企业的领导人，都懂得了社会主义竞赛的巨大作用，他们还没有把组织竞赛当做自己的责任，而仅仅看成是工会组织的责任。他们有这样一种说法：“我搞行政管理，你们搞竞赛”。甚至还有某些企业领导者不但不积极支持群众的创举，为实现这些创举建立有利条件，反而采取很多限制的办法，要求群众按照自己事先制定的规格来行动。例如，生产会议本来是群众的讲坛，它应该发扬职工对生产的主动精神，实行自下而上的群众监督。因为支持群众自下而上的监督就能够启发广大职工的主人翁的感觉，从而使职工更积极地揭发生产中存在的缺点。但是，有些企业的领导者只把生产会议看做是自己的讲坛，以长篇训话来代替群众的批评和自我批评。
    培养先进生产者是十分重要的事情，但是我们有些企业的领导者满足于拥有一两个突出人物，而对落后者采取“十过其门而不入”的态度。他们既然把培养先进生产者当做最后的目的，因而不认真地总结先进者的经验，不去切实地推广这些经验，对落后者也不去细心地了解他们的困难，帮助他们具备学习先进经验所必需的条件，结果，使先进者与落后者对立起来，先进者陷于孤立。
    经常地引导群众改进技术、改善生产组织和劳动组织，吸引群众提出合理化建议，并且及时采纳职工的建议，就能够保证劳动生产率不断提高，使国家计划提前完成。但是，有些企业的领导者，却习惯于在一旦发现国家计划没有完成的时候，运用层层督战，加班加点的办法来进行突击。这往往使设备事故和工伤事故增加，工资基金超支，产品质量下降，在生产上造成重大的损失。
    社会主义竞赛是在社会主义基本经济规律作用下产生的。社会主义基本经济规律的要求简单而通俗地说，就是：发展生产、保证需要。而发展生产是手段、保证需要是目的。根据这个基本经济规律，我们的党提出“在发展生产和提高劳动生产率的基础上逐步改善职工生活”的方针。必须认真地执行这一方针，广大职工才能够精力充沛、情绪饱满地进行劳动。关心人和人的需要，这是领导竞赛工作中的十分重要的事情。但是我们有些工会工作者和企业领导者却往往忘记了关心人这件事，他们不去运用国家给予他们改善工人劳动条件和生活条件的巨大可能性。他们以“节约”为名削减必要的劳动保护设施和合理的生活福利设施的经费，不正当地“节约”工资基金，甚至采取显然违法的手段来对待工人。这些做法都模糊了生产的目的性，打击了群众的劳动热情。
    物质鼓励原则体现着社会主义公共利益和个人利益的一致。实行正确的工资奖励制度，可以从物质上鼓励先进者并且促使落后者赶上先进者，这是组织竞赛的重要条件之一。但是，有些领导者却认为动员群众的积极性只有靠政治教育，而物质鼓励则会引导工人发展“个人主义”或“经济主义”。无疑问的，政治教育在过去、现在和将来都是我们动员群众的极为重要的手段。但是，我们的政治教育不能脱离社会物质生活的规律，相反，它必须能够正确地解说物质生活，并且为物质生活的实际发展所证明。我们的政治教育的巨大说服作用就在这里。我国工人阶级所以对于加速社会主义建设付出无比的热情，就是因为从解放以来的生活体验中，深刻地相信建成社会主义和进入共产主义会带来更为美好的生活。不应该把政治教育和物质鼓励对立起来，而必须把两者结合起来，从关心群众的物质利益上提高群众的共产主义觉悟水平。
    我国的社会主义建设和社会主义改造正在迅速地进行，新建企业陆续投入生产，原有企业逐步实行着技术改造。随着经济建设的高潮，在广大职工中正在掀起一个文化高潮，工人的物质生活也在不断的改善。这一切都为我国社会主义竞赛的发展创造着极为有利的条件。当前的问题是必须克服领导方面的右倾保守思想，依靠群众的积极性和创造性，加强对竞赛的领导，保证社会主义竞赛不断地高涨，使它切实发挥加速我国工业建设的强大动力的作用。
