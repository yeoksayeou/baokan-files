    Shenyang, May 19th (reporting from this newspaper) - The material preparation and painting workshops of Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory have recently, under the influence of the 1A62 machining workshop, gradually moved from backwardness towards advancement.

    In the past, the material preparation workshop frequently affected the supply of materials to the machining workshops due to poor planning and management. The painting workshop, due to unreasonable labor organization, failed to complete its plans for a long time. In March, Wang Wenshan, the director of the 1A62 machining workshop and a labor model, took the initiative to approach Cui Xuera, the director of the material preparation workshop, at a factory-wide conference for exchanging competition experiences, expressing his willingness to help him improve planning and management. Since then, the two workshop directors have often exchanged experiences after work. Cui Xuera, the director of the material preparation workshop, with Wang Wenshan's help, humbly learned from the experience of the 1A62 machining workshop and mastered the regular monthly plans and work shift plans. The entire workshop not only completed its plan in March but also made up for the shortfall in the plans not completed in January and February. In April, the total production value and total commodity value of this workshop both exceeded the plan by more than 20%.

    When learning from the advanced experience of the 1A62 machining workshop, the painting workshop adjusted its labor organization, changing the workshop's group piecework method to individual piecework, greatly unleashing the potential of the workers. In the past, the workshop was often crowded with machine tools waiting to be painted, and the workers were overwhelmed. Now, the workers are actively urging for more work. This workshop overfulfilled its production plan by 7.2% in April.

    沈阳第一机床厂落后车间走向先进
    本报沈阳19日电　沈阳第一机床厂备料、喷漆两个车间最近在一A六二加工车间的影响下，先后由落后逐步走向先进。
    过去备料车间由于计划管理工作作得不好，经常影响加工车间的材料供应，喷漆车间由于劳动组织不合理，长期完不成计划。三月份一A六二加工车间主任、劳动模范王文山在一次全厂召开的交流竞赛经验会议上，主动找到备料车间主任崔学冉，表示愿意帮他改进计划管理工作。从此，这两个车间主任就经常在下班以后交流经验。备料车间主任崔学冉在王文山的帮助下，虚心地学习了一A六二加工车间的经验，掌握了正规的月计划、工作班计划，整个车间三月份不仅完成了计划，而且补足了一二月份没有完成计划的差额。四月份这个车间的生产总值、商品总值都超过计划20％以上。
    喷漆车间在学习一A六二加工车间先进经验的时候，调整了劳动组织，将车间的大组计件的办法改为个人计件，工人潜力大大发挥出来。过去车间里经常挤满了等着喷漆的机床，工人们忙不过来，现在却是工人们主动催活干了。这个车间四月份超额7.2％完成了生产计划。
