Hainan Island Pineapples Hit the Market

    Hainan Island’s famous specialty – pineapples – have begun to hit the market in large quantities. According to surveys and statistics from major production areas such as Qiongshan, Wenchang, Qiongdong and Ding'an, this year's pineapple output is expected to reach 70,000 dan (7 million kilograms). The Hainan Island State-owned Fruit Purchasing Station is actively purchasing them. In addition to ensuring the supply to meet the needs of the urban people, 20,000 dan will be allocated for processing into canned food for sale to Shanghai, Beijing, the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries.

    海南岛菠萝上市
    海南岛著名的土特产——菠萝已开始大量上市。根据琼山、文昌、琼东、定安等主要产区的调查统计，今年菠萝产量可达到七万市担。海南岛国营水果采购站现正积极收购。除保证供应城市人民需要外，还要调拨二万担加工制造罐头食品，运销上海、北京以及苏联和各人民民主国家。
