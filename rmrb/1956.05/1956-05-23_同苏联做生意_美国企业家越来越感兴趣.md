Xinhua News Agency, New York, May 19th: Drell, a representative of the "National Broadcasting Company" of the United States, recently raised the issue of developing trade relations with the Soviet Union to listeners on the radio. Many American companies said in response that they were "very interested" in developing trade relations with the Soviet Union. According to Drell, many American entrepreneurs currently want to go to the Soviet Union and have already selected a delegation to visit the Soviet Union, which is scheduled to depart for the Soviet Union in June. The delegation consists of thirty-seven prominent figures from American business and finance.

The May 19th issue of "Business Week" also pointed out: "American business people are becoming increasingly interested in the possibility of selling goods to the Soviet Union." The magazine said: "A few months ago, the Department of Commerce received an average of ten applications per week for licenses to export goods to the Soviet bloc countries; currently, the Department of Commerce receives twenty such applications per week. In March, the total value of goods for which export licenses were issued was more than double the figure for the past seventy-six weeks."
