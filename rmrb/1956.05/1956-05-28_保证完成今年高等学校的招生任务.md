Guarantee the Completion of This Year's College Enrollment Task
Director of the National College Enrollment Committee Office, Assistant Minister of Higher Education, Ding Hua

There are only one and a half months left until this year's college entrance examination. Enrollment agencies at all levels and relevant units must promptly complete all preparatory work; all young people preparing to apply should carefully consider their college preferences and intensify their review and preparation for the examination.

The enrollment work this year, judging from the current situation, is generally proceeding smoothly.

After the State Council issued the "Instructions on Guaranteeing the Completion of This Year's College Enrollment Plan," it basically guaranteed the minimum source of candidates. Qualified young people from all walks of life are enthusiastically preparing to apply. The work of actively organizing candidates to review and prepare for the examination has begun in various places. The enrollment agencies in various regions are organized earlier this year than in previous years, and have more time to carry out various preparations. Education administrative departments, youth league organizations, and middle schools in various regions also attach great importance to the ideological education of candidates.

However, to fully complete this year's enrollment task, more work needs to be done, and there are still many problems that need to be solved.

First, actively expanding the source of candidates and organizing candidates to review and prepare for the examination remain one of the main tasks at present.

According to some materials, the main obstacle to expanding the source of candidates is that some units are preventing on-the-job cadres from freely applying. Some units are cold and discriminatory towards applying cadres, while others deliberately delay the time, and are slow to allow applying cadres to be semi-detached from work for tutoring. Some units use the excuse of not receiving notices from directly superior authorities to not implement the State Council's instructions on the free application of on-the-job cadres. Some units adopt the method of "prediction" or "screening" and insist that some cadres who can reach the high school level after tutoring do not meet the conditions for application. Individual units simply do not allow cadres to apply freely. Some comrades in some units believe that on-the-job cadres applying for colleges are "individualistic," "not at ease with their work," and "want to climb up," so they "criticize" these so-called wrong ideas and "persuade" them to give up their requirements for applying to colleges. These views and practices are obviously inappropriate.

It should be said that the enthusiastic application of young on-the-job people for colleges is in line with the needs of the country. This is a concrete manifestation of their response to the call of the country, and it is also a manifestation of their socialist enthusiasm and the ambition of young people. All units should give them enthusiastic encouragement and active support.

In the work of organizing candidates to review and prepare for the examination, although most of the candidate tutoring schools and tutoring classes in various places have already started classes, there are still many problems that need to be solved.

The primary problem is to improve the quality of teaching. At present, there is a great shortage of textbooks for candidate tutoring, and the lecture notes are not compiled in a timely manner, which cannot keep up with the needs of teaching. Seizing the time to compile lecture notes is an important aspect of ensuring the quality of teaching. It is best for provinces and cities to concentrate a part of the teachers to compile them uniformly. It is also very necessary for provinces and cities to exchange lecture notes and learn from each other. In the tutoring schools in some places, the number of students has increased rapidly, and there are difficulties in the allocation of teachers. The methods of giving large classes or broadcasting lectures have been adopted. This method is feasible under the current conditions; however, attention should be paid to strengthening tutoring to avoid reducing the quality of teaching.

The time issue for on-the-job cadres to review their lessons has not been completely resolved. Although some units formally allow applying cadres to be semi-detached from work, the amount of work assigned to them has not been reduced in practice. As a result, some cadres cannot complete the workload of the whole day in the afternoon after going to the tutoring school in the morning, and have to work overtime at night, and have to review their lessons late at night, which affects their health. This situation should be given serious attention. On-the-job cadres generally have been estranged from high school subjects for a long time, or their original foundation is relatively poor, and some people have to go far to the tutoring place, all of which requires more time; the work units where they are located should take these practical difficulties into account, give appropriate consideration, reduce their work, and give them more time to review and prepare for the examination.

Other on-the-job youth, such as primary school teachers and knowledgeable youth in the industrial and commercial sectors, also have similar problems with on-the-job cadres in terms of tutoring time, which should also be solved.

Second, seize the time to do a good job in the ideological education of candidates.

At present, most candidates have not finalized their college preferences. Many candidates are hesitant about what major and what school to choose. Even those who have initially determined their preferences may have insufficient understanding of the selected schools and majors. Some candidates "follow the crowd," and want to choose whichever major has more applicants; some candidates see that there are fewer applicants for a major, and think that it is easier to be admitted, so they want to apply for that major.

It should be estimated that many candidates have a one-sided understanding of the various majors set up by colleges to meet the needs of national socialist construction. Many people think that some majors are important and some majors are not important, that studying some majors has a promising future and studying some majors has no promising future. These views also exist among some candidates' teachers, friends, and parents, which have a certain impact on the candidates. These views are obviously incorrect. National construction requires various specialized talents, and the majors set up by colleges are all important, and applying for any of them is in line with the needs of the country.

Some majors, such as mining and metallurgy, surveying, meteorology, sports, Russian, and teacher training majors, have historically had fewer applicants, mainly because candidates have insufficient understanding of these majors. It is appropriate and necessary to focus on explaining the role and content of these majors to candidates, and to guide and mobilize more candidates to apply for these majors. However, some places mechanically stipulate that they must ensure that a certain proportion of candidates apply for certain majors. This practice often leads to the tendency to force candidates to fill in their preferences, which is very inappropriate.

When choosing their preferences, some candidates often only start from subjective wishes and do not realistically consider their own conditions. This will not only increase many difficulties in the examination, but even after entering school, due to their own conditions, they will encounter many insurmountable obstacles in their studies, which is detrimental to both their own development and the cause of national talent cultivation.

To correctly guide young people to choose their preferences, so that they have a correct understanding of the overall needs of the country's socialist construction, and realistically choose their preferences in combination with their own conditions (their own expertise, hobbies, and physical conditions, etc.). It is required that education administrative departments, middle schools, enrollment agencies, and relevant parties seize the time and vigorously do a good job in guiding candidates to correctly choose their preferences. The opinions of the candidates' teachers, friends, and parents often have a major impact on the candidates, and they have a responsibility to help the candidates correctly choose their preferences.

Some candidates, especially on-the-job cadres and knowledge youth who have stopped school and are waiting for employment, worry all day long that they will not be admitted, and fear that they will not pass the "barrier" of the entrance examination. Their ideological burden is very heavy, which affects the effect of reviewing and preparing for the examination. There are also some candidates, especially high school graduates, who believe that this year's enrollment task is large, the source of candidates is small, and there are many opportunities for admission. They have a fluke mentality and do not seriously review their lessons.

It should be explained to them that the purpose of the entrance examination is to test whether the candidates' academic level meets the basic requirements for college study. If the result of the examination is that some candidates' academic level is not enough, then it means that it is difficult to keep up with the study after admission, and they still need to further improve their academic level and take the exam later. Now, reviewing the lessons should not be regarded as coping with the examination and "passing the barrier," but as laying a foundation for the study after admission. Starting from this basic requirement, each candidate should seriously prepare for the lessons and treat the entrance examination with a realistic attitude. It is completely unnecessary to be full of worries before the examination, which will make oneself lose confidence in striving for victory in the examination; having a fluke mentality and not seriously preparing for the lessons in an attempt to take a chance will also easily lead to failure in the examination.

Among the knowledge youth who are preparing to apply for school and are waiting for employment, some are worried that the government does not have enough trust in them politically, and some are worried that there are restrictions on the number of knowledge youth who have stopped school and are waiting for employment when they are admitted. Therefore, they believe that the chances of admission are smaller than other types of candidates. These concerns are completely unnecessary and have no basis. Conducting political review of candidates is to ensure the political quality of new students. Whether it is for any type of candidate, the same review standards are adopted for review; the political review of knowledge youth who have stopped school and are waiting for employment will never be stricter. All knowledge youth who are preparing to apply for school and are waiting for employment should dispel their concerns and actively review and prepare for the examination.

Third, seize the time to do a good job in the political review and health examination of candidates. Political conditions and health conditions are important aspects of the quality of new students, and should be guaranteed to be done well in accordance with the prescribed requirements.

In terms of political review, the first thing to do at present is to establish and improve the review institutions of the enrollment work committee. Colleges should select cadres with relatively high political quality and certain experience in review work to participate in the work according to the needs. In the review work, be serious and responsible, and oppose sloppy and careless. Pay attention to correctly grasping the standards. Give full consideration to the progressive factors of young people.

In terms of health examination, embody the spirit of guaranteeing the quality of new college students and caring for young people, and conscientiously implement the methods and standards for examination issued by the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Higher Education.

There are many people who need to undergo health examinations, and the time is very short, which requires the health departments of various provinces and cities to seize the time to do this work well. However, some provinces and cities have not yet seriously carried out the health examination work for candidates, and if they do not seize it again, it will inevitably form a busy and passive phenomenon, which will affect the quality of the examination.

In the past, some places were extremely careless in the health examination of candidates, examining candidates with artificial legs as "normal limbs," and allowing candidates to check "flat feet" without taking off their shoes and socks. These phenomena are intolerable.

It is hoped that the provinces and cities will quickly arrange, earnestly check, and improve the quality of work for the health examination work of candidates.

The college enrollment work is a blitzkrieg work with a strict time limit. Now that the examination period is approaching, enrollment agencies at all levels, colleges and universities across the country, and relevant departments should seize the opportunity to do these tasks well, so as to ensure the comprehensive completion of this year's college enrollment task on a reliable basis.

    保证完成今年高等学校的招生任务
    全国高等学校招生委员会办公室主任  高等教育部部长助理  丁华
    现在，距离今年高等学校招生考试的日期，只有一个半月了。各级招生工作机构和有关单位须要及时做好各项准备工作；所有准备报考的青年，应当慎重考虑自己的升学志愿，加紧温课备考。
    今年的招生工作，从目前进行的情况来看，大体上是顺利的。
    国务院“关于保证完成今年高等学校招生计划的指示”发布以后，基本上保证了最低限度的考生来源。各方面合乎报考条件的青年，准备报考的很踊跃。积极组织考生温课备考的工作，已在各地展开。各地的招生工作机构，今年组织得比往年早，有比较多的时间来进行各项准备工作。各地教育行政部门、青年团组织和中学等各方面对考生的思想教育工作，也都是比较重视的。
    但是，要全面地完成今年的招生任务，还要做更多的工作，还有不少问题需要解决。
    第一，积极扩大考生来源和组织考生温课备考，仍然是当前的主要工作之一。
    根据了解到的一些材料看来，目前扩大考生来源的主要障碍，是有些单位阻拦在职干部自由报考。有的单位对报考的干部冷淡歧视，有的故意拖延时间，迟迟不让报考的干部半脱离工作进行补习。有的单位借口没有接到直属上级的通知而不执行国务院关于在职干部自由报考的指示。有的单位采取“预测”或“甄别”的办法，硬说一些经过补习就可以达到高中程度的干部不够报考的条件。个别的单位甚至干脆不准干部自由报考。有的单位的某些同志，认为在职干部要报考高等学校是“个人主义”，是“不安心工作”，是“想往上爬”，所以就去“批判”这些所谓错误的思想，“说服”他们放弃报考高等学校的要求。这些看法和作法显然是不妥当的。
    应当说，在职青年踊跃报考高等学校，是符合国家需要的，这正是他们响应国家号召的具体表现，也是他们的社会主义积极性和青年的上进心的一种表现，各单位都应当给他们以热情的鼓励和积极的支持。
    在组织考生温课备考的工作当中，各地的考生补习学校和补习班，大部分虽然已经开学上课，但是，还有许多问题需要解决。
    首要的问题是提高教学质量。目前考生补习用的教材很缺乏，讲义编写的不及时，跟不上教学的需要。抓紧时间编写讲义，是保证教学质量的重要方面。各省、市最好能够集中一部分教师统一编写。各省、市之间交换讲义、互相学习，也是很必要的。有的地方的补习学校，学生人数增加很快，教师的配备有困难，采取了上大课或广播讲授的办法。这个办法在目前的条件下是可行的；但是要注意加强辅导，避免因此降低教学的质量。
    在职干部补习功课的时间问题，还没有得到完全的解决。有的单位虽然形式上允许报考的干部半脱离工作，但是实际上交给他们的工作量却没有减少。以致有的干部上午去补习学校上课，下午就无法完成整日的工作量，晚上还要加班，不得不在深夜复习功课，影响了健康。这种情况应当给以严重的注意。在职干部一般对于高中学科荒疏已久，或者是原来的基础比较差，有的人到补习的地方很远，这些人都需要更多的时间；他们所在的工作单位，应当考虑到这些实际困难，适当照顾，减少他们的工作，给他们更多一些温课备考的时间。
    其他的在职青年，如小学教师和工商界知识青年，在补习时间方面，也有和在职干部类似的问题，也应该设法解决。
    第二，要抓紧时间做好对考生的思想教育工作。
    目前大部分考生的升学志愿还没有最后确定。不少考生对选择什么专业和什么学校，犹豫不决。即初步确定志愿的人，有的也会对于所选择的学校、专业认识不足。有的考生“随大流”，看那个专业报考的人多就想选那个专业；有的考生看那个专业报考人数少，认为容易录取，就想报考那个专业。
    应该估计到，有不少考生对于高等学校为适应国家社会主义建设需要而设置的各种专业的理解是片面的。有不少人认为某些专业重要，某些专业不重要，学习某些专业有发展前途，学习某些专业没有发展前途。这些看法，在一部分考生的老师、朋友和家长中间也是存在的，对考生有一定的影响。这些看法显然是不正确的。国家建设需要各种专门人材，高等学校设置的专业都是重要的，报考其中任何专业都是符合国家需要的。
    有的专业如矿冶、测量、气象、体育、俄语和师范各专业，历年报考的人数比较少，主要是由于考生对这些专业认识不足。着重把这些专业的作用和内容向考生进行解释，指导、动员更多的考生报考这些专业：是应该的、必要的。但是，有的地方机械地规定，要求保证动员一定比例的考生报考某些专业，这种做法，往往造成强迫考生选填志愿的偏向，是很不妥当的。
    有的考生选择志愿的时候，往往只从主观愿望出发，不去实事求是地考虑自己的条件。这不仅在考试的时候会增加许多困难，而且，即使入学以后，由于自己的条件限制，学习上也会遇到许多难以克服的障碍，无论对自己的发展或是对国家培养人材的事业，都是不利的。
    要正确地指导青年选择志愿，使他们对于国家的社会主义建设的全面需要有正确的认识，结合自己的条件（本人的专长、爱好和身体情况等）实事求是地选择志愿。要求教育行政部门、中学、招生机构和有关方面，抓紧时间，大力做好指导考生正确地选择志愿的工作。考生的老师、朋友和家长的意见，往往对考生发生重大的影响，他们有责任帮助考生正确地选择志愿。
    有一些考生，特别是在职干部和停学待业的知识青年，成天担忧考不取，惟恐过不了入学考试这一“关”，思想负担很重，影响了温课备考的效果。也有一些考生，特别是高中毕业生，认为今年招生任务大，考生来源少，录取的机会多，存在着侥幸的心理，不认真复习功课。
    应当向他们说明，入学考试的目的是测验考生的学业水平是否符合高等学校学习的基本要求。如果考试的结果，有的考生的学业水平不够，那就是说，录取入学很难跟得上学习，还须要进一步提高学业水平，以后再考。现在复习功课，不能看成是应付考试和“过关”，而是为录取后的学习打下基础。从这个基本要求出发，每个考生都应当认真地准备功课，以实事求是的态度来对待入学考试。在考试之前，就忧虑重重，是完全不必要的，会使得自己丧失争取考试胜利的信心；心存侥幸，不认真准备功课，企图碰运气，那在考试中也容易遭到失败。
    准备报考的停学待业知识青年中，有的人顾虑政府在政治上对他们不够信任，有的人担心录取的时候对停学待业知识青年在名额上有限制，因此，他们认为录取的机会比其他类考生要小一些。这些顾虑是完全不必要的，是没有任何根据的。对考生进行政治审查是为了保证新生的政治质量，无论是对那一类考生，都是采取统一的审查标准来进行审查；决不会对停学待业知识青年的政治审查严格一些。至于录取的名额，对任何一类考生都没有限制，只要符合录取的条件就予以录取，对停学待业知识青年和对其他类考生一样看待。所有准备报考的停学待业知识青年应当打消顾虑，积极温课备考。
    第三，要抓紧时间做好对考生的政治审查和健康检查工作。政治条件和健康条件是新生质量的重要方面，应当按照规定的要求，保证做好。
    在政治审查方面，目前首先要建立和健全招生工作委员会的审查机构。高等学校应该按照需要选派政治质量比较高、有一定审查工作经验的干部参加工作。在审查工作中，要认真负责，反对草率马虎。要注意正确掌握标准。要充分估计青年的进步因素。
    在健康检查方面，要体现保证高等学校新生质量和爱护青年的精神，认真执行卫生部、教育部、高等教育部关于检查的办法和标准。
    进行健康检查的人数很多，时间又很短促，这就要求各省、市卫生部门抓紧时间做好这项工作。但是有的省、市直到现在还没有认真进行对考生的健康检查工作，如果再不抓紧，必然形成忙乱被动现象，影响检查的质量。
    过去，有的地方对考生的健康检查极不认真，把有假腿的考生检查成“四肢正常”，让考生不脱鞋袜来检查“平跖足”等等。这些现象是不能容忍的。
    希望各省、市对于考生健康检查工作，迅速布置，认真检查，提高工作质量。
    高等学校的招生工作，是一项期限严格的突击性工作。现在考期日益迫近，各级招生机构、全国各高等学校和有关部门，抓紧时机做好这些工作，才能在可靠的基础上保证今年高等学校招生任务的全面完成。
