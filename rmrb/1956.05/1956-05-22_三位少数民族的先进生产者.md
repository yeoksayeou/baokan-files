    Three Advanced Producers from Minority Nationalities
    By our reporter, Liu Heng

    **The Dai Postal Worker Feng Tingzhong**

    The road from Lincang to Gengma in Yunnan is treacherous, taking ten days for a round trip. The route is full of high mountains and dangerous ridges, with wild animals roaming about. Local people are afraid to travel this road. People say, "If you want to go from Gengma, buy your coffin first!" In the past, postal routes in this area were impassable. The Dai postal worker Feng Tingzhong, with his courage and determination, opened this route in 1953.

    "The people on the frontier are longing for news from all over the motherland!" Whenever he was tired, hungry, or stopped by strong winds and heavy rain, he encouraged himself in this way. In 1954, he further opened the route from Gengma to Cangyuan. This road also required climbing mountains and crossing ridges, and was steep and narrow. The residents along the way were mostly Kawa people, who spoke a different language and had inconvenient food and lodging. When Feng Tingzhong arrived at a village, he would help the residents sweep the floor, carry water, and do whatever he could. He would explain the Communist Party's ethnic policies and examples of concern and love for the fraternal ethnic groups in the border area to the elderly who understood the Dai language. The Kawa men and women treated him as their own kin. The local chieftain said, "Come and stay at my house whenever you pass by in the future. We are brothers, and I won't be happy if you don't come."

    An elderly Kawa man told him that there was a shortcut from Gengma to Cangyuan, but because there were often robbers on this road in the past, no one had used it for many years. Feng Tingzhong jumped up with joy when he heard this news. He thought: If this shortcut could be found, the people in the border area would be able to see the newspapers earlier, how wonderful that would be! The next day, he asked a Kawa brother to take him to find the road. After many rocks, steep cliffs, and grasslands, they finally found this shortcut in the wilderness. From then on, the people in the Cangyuan area could see the newspapers two days earlier.

    **Hao Erla Cannot Leave Her Beloved Cattle**

    "No force can make me leave my beloved cattle," said Hao Erla, an eighteen-year-old Mongolian girl. "That time, my fiancé came and insisted that I leave the pasture and go to his house to become a single-household farmer. As a result, we fell out."

    Hao Erla came to the Huangqi Pasture in Chahar League, Inner Mongolia in 1954. She recognized every cow as if she recognized every family member. She also clearly remembered which cow had given birth to what kind of calf. She said, "If I don't remember clearly, what if a calf drinks the wrong milk or gets kicked by the mother cow?" When she was milking at night, she noticed that every cow was constantly struggling to get away. She thought, "The cows are hungry and want to eat grass!" So she suggested: Let the cattle graze once more every night.

    Whether it was a night full of stars or a pitch-black night, Hao Erla always rode her horse and herded the cattle to graze in the wild. Once, she encountered a wolf. She shouted loudly and chased after it on horseback, driving the wolf away.

    One day, Hao Erla heard the Hui woman Hai Xiuzhen chatting with the Han woman Guan Hongying, saying that they both didn't want to work anymore and wanted to go home. Hao Erla thought, "They want to leave such a good pasture. This is because they are new here, not familiar with the work, and not used to it. I should help them well." Hao Erla saw that they were not used to Mongolian food, so she told them to eat Han or Hui food. Hao Erla saw that when they were milking, they used too much force, and the cows were in so much pain that they ran away, knocking down both the people and the milk buckets. She told them, "You can't be impatient when milking, you have to stroke them gently and milk slowly, just like a baby sucking milk. The cows will feel comfortable and more milk will flow." Now, Hai Xiuzhen and Guan Hongying are already skilled pasture workers.

    **Qian Fenyu, Helping Staff Live a Good Life**

    In the Chaoyangchuan area of Jilin Province, there are about 500 households of railway staff families, more than 300 of whom are Korean and more than 100 of whom are Han. The family committee leads and helps these 500 households to live a happy and beautiful life.

    Qian Fenyu, who is Korean, has moved three times in the past ten years. Every time she goes to a new place, everyone elects her as the director of the family committee.

    Qian Fenyu noticed that some staff members did not have watches, so she thought of buying an iron bell and hanging it in the residential area. The families took turns ringing the wake-up bell every day to ensure that everyone could get to work on time. Some staff members often missed work due to family members being sick or giving birth, so the family committee organized mutual aid to take care of the sick and postpartum women. In the past year alone, more than 50 households have received care.

    Qian Fenyu also organized the families to raise pigs, sheep, and grow vegetables, and carry out various sideline productions. Everyone accumulated a part of the activity fund for the family committee from the collective production. They used a part of the fund to purchase materials, provided their own labor, and built a house for the kindergarten.

    The family committee has been very successful in organizing learning. Four years ago, they established literacy groups on the kang (heated brick bed), which were later changed to cultural classes, and became a formal cultural school in 1954. Now the school has nineteen classes. Of the families, there were originally 173 illiterate people, and 103 have been eliminated. Qian Fenyu has reached the level of higher primary school from being illiterate.

    Qian Fenyu often conducts political and ethnic policy education among the families in an organized manner. After studying the worker-peasant alliance, the families further realized the relationship between workers and peasants, and everyone automatically accumulated fertilizer and sent it to the peasants. The family committee often organizes Korean and Han families to have parties and discussions to study ethnic policies and educate everyone to respect each other's customs and habits and learn each other's ethnic languages. Last year, they also carried out an ethnic unity month among the families, and at the end of the month, they rewarded eight models of ethnic unity and set an example among the masses.

    三位少数民族的先进生产者
    本报记者　刘衡
    傣族邮递员俸廷仲
    从云南临沧到耿马，道路艰险，来回要走十天。沿途是高山峻岭，野兽出没，当地人都害怕走这条路。人们说：“要从耿马走，先把棺材买到手！”过去，这一带邮路不通。傣族邮递员俸廷仲凭他的勇敢和决心，在1953年开辟了这条线路。
    “边疆的人民，是多么盼望着来自祖国各地的消息呵！”每当他走疲倦了，肚里饥饿了，或大风大雨要阻止他前进的时候，他就这样鼓舞自己。1954年，他又进一步开辟了从耿马到沧源的路线。这条路，也是要爬山越岭，又陡又窄，沿途居民多是佧瓦族，语言不通，食宿不便。俸廷仲在走班的时候，一到寨子，就去帮助居民扫地、挑水，见活就做；对懂傣族话的老人讲共产党的民族政策和关心、热爱边疆各兄弟民族的事例。佧瓦族的男女把他当作自己的亲人。当地头人说：“以后过路都来我家住，我们是兄弟，你不来，我就不喜欢了。”
    有个佧瓦族的老人告诉他，有一条从耿马到沧源的近路，过去因为这条路上常有强盗，多年没人走了。俸廷仲听到这消息，高兴得跳起来，他想：要是把这条近路找出来，边疆的人民就可以早些看到报纸，那多好呵！第二天，他便请一个佧瓦族的弟兄带他去找路。经过许多乱石、陡岩和茅草地，终于在荒山中找到了这条近路。从此，沧源一带的人民可以提前两天看到报纸了。
    好尔拉离不开心爱的牛
    “无论什么力量也不能让我离开我心爱的牛。”十八岁的蒙古姑娘好尔拉说：“那次我未婚夫来，一定要我离开牧场，到他家去做单干户。结果，我们闹僵了。”
    好尔拉是在1954年来到内蒙古察哈尔盟黄旗牧场的。她像认得每位亲人一样认得每一头牛，哪头母牛下了一头什么样的牛犊，她也记得清清楚楚。她说：“要是不记清楚，小牛吃错了奶，被母牛踢了脚，怎么办？”晚上挤奶的时候，她发现每头母牛都是不住地往外挣。她想：“牛饿了，想吃草啦！”就提出：每天晚上再放一次牛。
    不管是满天星星的晚上，还是黑漆漆的夜里，好尔拉总是骑着马，吆喝着牛群到野地去放牧。有一次，碰见一头狼，她放声大喊，打马追上前去，把狼撵跑了。
    一天，好尔拉听见回族海秀珍在跟汉族关红英闲谈，说是两人都不想干了，想回家。好尔拉想：“这样好的牧场，她们都要离开。这是因为她们刚来，工作不熟悉，过不惯。我应该好好帮助她们。”好尔拉见她们吃不惯蒙古伙食，就叫她们去吃汉灶、回灶。好尔拉见她们挤奶，用力太大，牛痛得直跑，把人跟奶桶都撞倒了，她就告诉她们：“挤奶不能性急，要轻轻地抚摩，慢慢地挤，就像娃娃吸奶一样。母牛感到舒服，奶就流得多。”现在，海秀珍、关红英已经是熟练的牧场工人了。
    帮助职工过好生活的千粉玉
    在吉林省朝阳川地区住着五百来户铁路职工家属，有三百多户是朝鲜族，一百多户是汉族。家属委员会领导和帮助这五百来户人家，使他们家家都过着愉快美好的生活。
    朝鲜族的千粉玉十年来搬过三次家，每到一个地方，大家都选她当家属委员会的主任。
    千粉玉见有些职工没有表，她就想法买了一口铁钟，挂在住宅区，每天由家属们轮流打起床钟，保证大家能准时上班。有些职工常因家属害病、生育而缺勤，家属委员会就组织互助，负责看护病人和产妇。去年一年中，就有五十多户人得到照顾。
    千粉玉还组织家属们养猪、养羊、种蔬菜，进行各种副业生产。大家从集体的生产中为家属委员积蓄了一部分活动基金。她们拿一部分基金购买材料，自己出劳力，给幼儿园盖了一所房子。
    家属委员会在组织学习方面是很有成绩的。四年前她们就成立了炕头识字组，以后改为文化班，到1954年就成了正规的文化学校。现在学校有十九个班。家属中原有173名文盲，已经扫除了103名。千粉玉已经由文盲达到了高小程度。
    千粉玉经常有组织地在家属中进行政治和民族政策的教育。经过关于工农联盟的学习之后，家属们进一步认识了工人和农民的关系，大家就自动积肥送给农民。家属委员会经常组织朝鲜族和汉族家属进行联欢、座谈，学习民族政策，教育大家互相尊重风俗习惯，互相学习民族语言。去年她们还在家属中开展了民族团结月，在月末奖励了八位民族团结的模范，在群众中树立榜样。（附图片）
