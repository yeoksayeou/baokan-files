Friendship Between Countries is Getting Closer
By Naibaho, Member of the Indonesian Journalists Delegation, Editor-in-Chief of Indonesian "People's Daily"

After a three-week tour of industrial and agricultural construction in the People's Republic of China, my confidence that the socialist system is superior to the capitalist system has become even more firm and strong. The achievements of the Chinese people in a short period of time have exceeded my original estimates.

President Sukarno said in his opening speech at the Bandung Asian-African Conference a year ago: "Let a new Asia and a new Africa be born!"

A new Asia and Africa have indeed been born, and have even exceeded this prediction. Among the countries of Asia and Africa, some have moved forward with strides that have shaken the world.

In Bandung, I saw how Premier Zhou Enlai patiently explained his country's peaceful policies, and how resolutely he insisted on the necessity of peaceful coexistence among all countries. In China, I saw with my own eyes how the Chinese people are working hard to build a new world; I saw the extremely sincere friendship shown by the Chinese people to every foreign guest who visits their country.

In China, it is clear that construction and peace are inseparable. Similarly, Indonesia also needs to maintain peaceful and friendly relations with all countries.

Like other Asian and African countries, China and Indonesia have many things in common. Both countries have suffered from the very cruel exploitation of colonialism. Having successfully freed themselves from the shackles of colonialism, the current Asian and African countries jointly face a huge task, which is to eliminate the poverty left over from the old era and build a happy new life.

The historic Asian-African Conference showed a great truth: Asian and African countries, which have many things in common in history, can and have the responsibility to live peacefully. Although they have different religious beliefs, races, and social systems, they should help and respect each other in eliminating the disasters of colonialism, building their economies, and improving the living standards of their people.

The declaration of the Asian-African Conference pointed out the direction that Asian and African countries should take. Whoever violates this direction will sooner or later isolate themselves and encounter difficulties. Indeed, the declaration of the Asian-African Conference is becoming more and more recognized everywhere. The power of the "Bandung Spirit" is increasingly showing. Mutual visits by national leaders, cultural delegations, and trade delegations of Asian and African countries are becoming more frequent. Based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, China has recently established normal diplomatic relations with several more countries. In addition, the friendly relations between China and other countries have also developed well. These all prove that countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully and carry out mutually beneficial economic cooperation.

A year ago, Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo and Premier Zhou Enlai visited each other to strengthen the friendship between Indonesia and China. To further strengthen this friendship, President Sukarno will visit China soon.

Long live the friendship between China and Indonesia!
Long live world peace!

### 各国之间的友谊更加密切

    各国之间的友谊更加密切
    印度尼西亚新闻工作者代表团团员  印度尼西亚“人民日报”总编辑  奈巴霍
    在中华人民共和国进行了三个星期的对工业和农业建设的参观以后，我对于社会主义制度比资本主义制度优越的信心更加坚定和更加强烈了。中国人民在短期内所取得的成就超过了我原来的估计。
    苏加诺总统一年前在万隆亚非会议的开幕词中说过：“让新亚洲和新非洲诞生吧！”
    新的亚洲和非洲确实已经诞生了，而且还超过了这个预言。在亚洲和非洲的国家中有的已经向前迈进，以震动全世界的大步伐向前迈进。
    在万隆，我看到了周恩来总理是如何耐心地说明他的国家的和平政策，看到他是怎样坚决地坚持各国的和平共处的必要性。在中国我亲眼看到了中国人民是在如何努力地建设一个新的世界；看到中国人民对每一个访问他们国家的外宾所表示的极真诚的友谊。
    在中国这个国度里，可以清楚地看到建设与和平是不可分割的。同样的，印度尼西亚也需要和各国保持和平和友好的关系。
    正如亚非其他国家一样，中国和印度尼西亚有着许多共同点。这两个国家都曾经遭受殖民主义的非常残酷的剥削。目前的亚非各国，在成功地摆脱了殖民主义桎梏以后共同面临着巨大的事业，这就是消灭旧时代遗留下来的贫困以及建设幸福的新生活。
    有历史意义的亚非会议显示出了一个伟大的真理：在历史上有着许多共同点的亚非各国能够而且有责任和平地生活。虽然它们之间还有不同的宗教信仰、种族和社会制度，但在消灭殖民主义的灾难、建设它们的经济以及在提高人民的生活水平的事业中，它们应该互相帮助和互相尊重。
    亚非会议的宣言指出了亚非各国所应该走的方向。谁违背了这个方向，或快或慢必将使它自己孤立起来和感到困难。的确，亚非会议的宣言在各个地方是越来越被认识了。“万隆精神”的力量日益显示出来。亚非各国的国家领导人、文化代表团和贸易代表团的互相访问是更加频繁了。根据和平共处的五项原则，最近中国又和好几个国家建立了正常的外交关系。此外，中国和其他国家的友好关系也有很好的发展。这些都证明了不同社会制度的国家可以和平共处和进行互利的经济合作。
    一年前，阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约总理和周恩来总理为了加强印度尼西亚和中国的友谊而互相访问。为了更加强这个友谊，不久以后苏加诺总统将要访问中国。
    中国和印度尼西亚的友谊万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
