Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: The Vietnamese Minority Delegation concluded its visit to Beijing today and left Beijing by train in the afternoon to visit Tianjin.

During their visit to Beijing, the delegation held a pleasant gathering with the Vietnamese students studying at Peking University. More than 120 Vietnamese students sent representatives to greet the delegation from the Peking University library to their dormitories, where they were divided into small groups for cordial talks with the members. The Vietnamese students inquired about the situation in their hometowns and introduced their studies and lives to them. Delegation leader Sa Wenming also met his two nephews who were studying at Peking University. When Nu Pu, a Vietnamese combat hero and member of the delegation, was discovered by the Vietnamese students, they immediately surrounded him and lifted him up on their shoulders. This enthusiastic gathering delayed the delegation's departure from the school by nearly twenty minutes. Before leaving, Sa Wenming thanked Peking University for educating and caring for Vietnamese students as if they were Chinese students, and wished for a deeper friendship between China and Vietnam.

When the delegation visited the Huimin Academy on the 9th, they were warmly welcomed by the school's students who were participating in labor-defense exercises. At the Yonghe Lama Temple and Guangji Temple, the Buddhist members of the delegation met with Chinese Buddhists. Keum ethnic group member and Dharma Master Ming Zhang said after visiting the two temples that after arriving in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam from the Soc Trang region of South Vietnam, he saw the Democratic Republic of Vietnam's policy of ethnic equality and religious freedom, and now he has seen China's policy of ethnic equality, unity and religious freedom in Beijing.

    越南少数民族代表团结束在北京的访问活动
    据新华社15日讯　越南少数民族代表团今天结束了在北京的访问活动，在下午乘火车离开北京去天津参观。
    代表团在北京参观期间，同在北京大学学习的越南留学生作了一次愉快的联欢。一百二十多个越南留学生推派代表从北京大学的图书馆把代表团迎接到自己的宿舍前面，分成许多小组同团员作了亲切的谈话。越南留学生向团员们探询着自己家乡的情况，并且向他们介绍了自己的学习和生活。沙文明团长也在这里会见了他的两个在北京大学学习的侄子。当代表团团员、越南战斗英雄努普被越南留学生们发现以后，人们立刻把他团团围住，并且把他抬起来举在肩上。这次热情的联欢把代表团离开学校的时间推迟了近二十分钟。在临别的时候，沙文明团长感谢北京大学像培养中国学生一样地教育和关怀越南留学生，并且祝中越友谊更加深厚。
    代表团在九日参观回民学院时，受到了正在参加劳卫操的全校学生们的热烈欢迎。在雍和宫和广济寺，代表团中信奉佛教的团员们，会见了中国的佛教徒。代表团的可姆族团员名章法师在参观这两处寺庙以后说，他从南越的朔庄地区到达越南民主共和国以后，看到了越南民主共和国的民族平等和宗教自由政策，现在又在北京看到了中国的民族平等、团结和宗教自由政策。
