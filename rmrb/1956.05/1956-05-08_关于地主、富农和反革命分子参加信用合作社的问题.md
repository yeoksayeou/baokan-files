On the Question of Landlords, Rich Peasants, and Counter-Revolutionary Elements Participating in Credit Cooperatives

Some readers have written to inquire: Can rural credit cooperatives allow landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements to join?

Now we answer this question as follows:

The issue of former landlords, rich peasant elements who have abandoned exploitation, and counter-revolutionary elements participating in credit cooperatives should be handled in accordance with the spirit of Articles 4 and 5 of the National Agricultural Development Program.

Landlords and rich peasants who have performed relatively well and have already been absorbed into agricultural cooperatives as members can be absorbed as members of credit cooperatives. Those who perform generally but have already become probationary members of agricultural cooperatives may also be allowed to join credit cooperatives as members with the approval of the board of directors. Those who perform poorly and are placed under the control of agricultural cooperatives by the township people's committee for production are not allowed to participate in credit cooperatives; if they have already joined the credit cooperative, they should be purged from the cooperative during the rectification of the credit cooperative organization.

Among counter-revolutionary elements, those who engage in sabotage activities and those who have serious crimes in history, are greatly resented by the people, and have been arrested and brought to justice by the government, should be immediately expelled from the cooperative and their membership资格 revoked if they are members of the credit cooperative; if they have loans in the credit cooperative, they should be immediately recovered. Only those who have general historical crimes, no current sabotage activities, and are not greatly resented by the people, that is, those who are placed under the control of agricultural cooperatives by the township people's committee for production and labor reform, are not allowed to participate in credit cooperatives; if they have already joined the credit cooperative, they should be purged from the cooperative during the rectification of the credit cooperative organization. Only those who have minor crimes but have now repented, those who have been released after serving their sentences and have performed well, and those who, although having committed crimes, have made significant contributions to the suppression of counter-revolution and have been stripped of their counter-revolutionary label and called peasants, if they have already joined agricultural cooperatives as formal members or probationary members, can be absorbed into credit cooperatives. As for the family members of counter-revolutionary elements, as long as they have not participated in criminal activities, they should be treated the same as ordinary peasants and allowed to participate in credit cooperatives.

All former landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements who become members of credit cooperatives shall not hold any position in the credit cooperative for a certain period of time (director, accountant, director, supervisor, group leader of members, or representative of members, etc.). When credit cooperatives purge landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements from the cooperative, they should refund the shares but not the membership fee.

Former landlords, rich peasant elements who have abandoned exploitation, and counter-revolutionary elements (except those who have been arrested according to law), regardless of whether they have obtained membership资格, should be allowed to deposit money in credit cooperatives and be paid interest in accordance with regulations. Those who meet the conditions for members of agricultural cooperatives and credit cooperatives and have already changed their status to peasants, if they request loans for production or to maintain their livelihood, after mass discussion and approval by the board of directors, can also be allowed to borrow a portion, provided that the credit cooperative is indeed able to solve the production and livelihood funding difficulties of all agricultural cooperatives and peasants in the township—especially poor peasants. However, credit cooperatives should supervise them to prevent them from spending loans recklessly, otherwise they should be recovered immediately. Answering Readers' Questions

### 关于地主、富农和反革命分子参加信用合作社的问题

　　关于地主、富农和反革命分子参加信用合作社的问题
　　有些读者来信询问：农村信用合作社是否可以允许地主、富农和反革命分子入社？
    现在我们对这个问题答复如下：
    对于过去的地主分子、已经放弃剥削的富农分子和反革命分子参加信用合作社的问题，应该根据全国农业发展纲要第四条和第五条的精神处理。
    地主、富农中，表现较好而已经由农业社吸收为社员的，可以吸收为信用社社员。表现一般、但是已经成为农业社候补社员的，经过理事会批准，也可以允许他们加入信用社做社员。表现不好而由乡人民委员会交农业社管制生产的，不准参加信用社；如果原来已经参加了信用社，在整顿信用社组织的时候，应该把他们清洗出社。
    反革命分子中，凡进行破坏活动的分子和在历史上有严重罪行、民愤很大而被政府逮捕法办的分子，如果是信用社社员，应该立即开除出社，取消其社员资格；如果在信用社有贷款的，应该立即追回。只有一般的历史罪行、没有现行破坏活动而民愤不大的分子，即由乡人民委员会交农业社管制生产、劳动改造的分子，不准许参加信用社；如果原来已经参加了信用社，在整顿信用社组织的时候应该清洗出社。只有轻微罪行而现在已经悔改的分子、刑满释放而表现好的分子，以及虽有罪行但是对于镇压反革命立有显著功劳而已被摘掉反革命帽子称为农民的分子，如果已经加入农业社为正式社员或候补社员的，可以吸收他们参加信用社。至于对反革命分子的家属，只要他们没有参加犯罪行为，应当同一般农民一样看待，允许他们参加信用社。
    所有成为信用社社员的原来的地主、富农和反革命分子，在一定时期内，都不能担任信用社的任何职务（主任、会计、理事、监事、社员小组长或社员代表等）。信用社在清洗地主、富农和反革命分子出社时，应当退还股金，但是不退入社费。
    对于过去的地主分子、已经放弃剥削的富农分子和反革命分子（除了已经被依法逮捕的以外），不论是否已经取得社员资格，都应该准许他们在信用社存款，并且照章付给利息。凡是够农业社和信用社社员条件，并且已经改变成份为农民的，在信用社资金力量确能解决全乡农业社和农民——特别是贫困农民的生产、生活资金困难的情况下，如果他们为了生产或为了维持生活要求贷款，经过群众讨论、理事会批准，也可以准许贷借一部分。但是信用社应该监督他们不把贷款胡花乱用，否则应该立即收回。答读者问
