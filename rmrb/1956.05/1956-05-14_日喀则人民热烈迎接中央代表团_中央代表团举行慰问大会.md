Xinhua News Agency, Xigaze, 13th: The Central Delegation's main group and the first subgroup entered the ancient city of Xigaze, on the banks of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, yesterday through a welcoming line stretching for ten *li*. More than 20,000 citizens and returning farmers and herdsmen welcomed the Central Delegation with extreme excitement. The day before, people had bathed in the river and tried on new clothes. More than a dozen彩门 (decorated archways) and nearly a thousand 彩旗 (colored flags) decorated both sides of the road from the city to the east bank of the Nyang Chu River.

When the Central Delegation passed through the welcoming line, the Panchen Erdeni accompanied Chen Yi in an open car at the front of the convoy. At this time, cheers erupted, and people threw *hada*, bouquets into the car, shouting: "Welcome to the Central Delegation's visit to Tibet!" "Long live the great unity of all nationalities in the country!" In the welcoming line were several thousand farmers from seventy or eighty *li* around Xigaze, some of whom had brought their families to Xigaze several days earlier. They paid tribute to the Central Delegation, holding plates filled with highland barley and mixed with peacock feathers, and holding up the wheat ears from last year's bumper harvest.

More than 600 farmer and herdsmen representatives from more than 40 *dzong* and *xika* in the middle and upper reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo River and the Himalayan mountains came from hundreds of *li* away from rural areas and pastures with *hada* and tribute letters to welcome them.

All the lamas of Tashilhunpo Monastery and representatives of more than a dozen temples near Xigaze, a total of more than 4,000 people, welcomed the delegation with the most solemn religious ceremonies.

More than twenty male and female song and dance troupes, composed of more than a thousand citizens and suburban farmers, wearing brocade clothes and gorgeous headdresses, beat drums and danced with colorful ribbons when the delegation's vehicles passed, enthusiastically dancing the "Chuba Shema." This kind of song and dance has only been performed three times in the last thirty years. The first time was to welcome the Panchen Erdeni back to Tibet, and the second time was to celebrate the opening of the road from Lhasa to Xigaze.

Before entering the city, the Central Delegation participated in a welcoming ceremony held by the local people in the eastern suburbs of Xigaze. In his speech, the Panchen Erdeni warmly welcomed the delegation's visit to Xigaze. He said: "The Central Delegation's visit to Xigaze will further consolidate and develop the unity between Tibet and all fraternal nationalities of the motherland, promote the greater development of various construction undertakings in the Xigaze area, and at the same time, further promote our victorious implementation of various reforms and the early establishment of a unified Tibetan Autonomous Region, and transition to a prosperous and happy socialist society together with all fraternal nationalities of the motherland." In his speech, Chen Yi thanked the Panchen Erdeni and all the monks and lay people in the Xigaze area for their grand welcome, and on behalf of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, extended greetings to all the citizens of Xigaze.

Accompanying the delegation to Xigaze were Zhang Guohua, Acting Secretary of the CCP Tibet Working Committee and Commander of the Tibet Military Region, and Doka Ponjor Rabgye, *kalon* of the Tibet Local Government.

When the Central Delegation's main group and first subgroup passed through Dagzhuka (80 kilometers from Xigaze) in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo River on the 11th, they were also warmly welcomed by the local Tibetan people.

Xinhua News Agency, Xigaze, 13th: The Central Delegation's main group and first subgroup held a comforting assembly in the People's Square in Xigaze today, attended by more than 15,000 people.

Zhang Jingwu, Deputy Head of the Delegation, first expressed cordial greetings to the Party, government, military, and people in the Xigaze area on behalf of Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Zhu, Chairman Liu, and Premier Zhou. Zhang Jingwu said: "The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region will lead Tibet to a new stage of increasing development, progress, prosperity and happiness, and it will certainly be able to fully realize the glorious historical task of a more united and more unified Tibetan Autonomous Region." Then, he pointed out: "The more united, progressive, and developed we are, the more imperialist elements and reactionaries will try their best to undermine our unity, progress, and development. Therefore, we must be a hundred times more vigilant." Jiantong Jigme, Director of the Panchen Kanpo Lija Committee, said that the Central Delegation's arrival in Xigaze has brought the deep concern of Chairman Mao and all the people of all ethnic groups in the country, as well as the warmth of the motherland, which will more powerfully inspire our confidence in building a prosperous hometown and a socialist new Tibet. He said: All the people of Tibet must always be vigilant against the imperialist conspiracies of provocation and sabotage, and strive for the victorious implementation of democratic reforms, the early realization of a unified Tibet Autonomous Region, and the construction of a prosperous and happy new Tibet of the motherland.

During the comforting assembly, the Central Delegation presented banners and gifts to the Panchen Kanpo Lija Committee, the Xigaze Sub-committee of the CCP Tibet Working Committee, and the Xigaze Dzong. The Panchen Kanpo Lija Committee presented banners to the Central Delegation and the members of the delegation from seventeen ethnic groups, and on behalf of the Panchen Erdeni, presented gifts to Chen Yi, the head of the delegation and Vice Premier of the State Council. The Xigaze Sub-committee of the CCP Tibet Working Committee and the Xigaze Dzong also presented banners to the delegation.

Finally, the literary and artistic work team that accompanied the Central Delegation to Tibet performed a comforting performance.

    日喀则人民热烈迎接中央代表团
    中央代表团举行慰问大会
    据新华社日喀则13日电　中央代表团总团和第一分团昨天通过十里长的欢迎行列，进入雅鲁藏布江边的古城日喀则。两万多市民和回乡的农、牧民以极度兴奋的心情，来迎接中央代表团。前一天，人们就在河边洗了澡，试穿了新衣。从市区通往年楚河东岸的公路两旁，装饰着十几座彩门和近千面彩旗。
    当中央代表团通过欢迎行列的时候，班禅额尔德尼陪同陈毅乘上敞篷汽车走在车队的前面。这时候，欢声雷动，人们纷纷将哈达、花束抛到车里，高呼：“欢迎中央代表团访问西藏！”“全国各民族大团结万岁！”在欢迎行列里，有从日喀则周围七、八十里地来的几千农民，有些是在几天前就全家来到了日喀则。他们捧着盛满青稞和拌有孔雀毛的盘子，举着去年丰收的麦穗，向中央代表团致敬。
    来自雅鲁藏布江中、上游和喜马拉雅山区四十多个宗和溪卡的六百多名农、牧民代表，带着哈达和致敬信，从几百里外的农村和牧场赶来欢迎。
    扎什伦布寺的全体喇嘛和日喀则附近十几个寺庙的代表共有四千多人，用最隆重的宗教仪式欢迎代表团。
    由一千多个市民和郊区农民组成的二十多个男女歌舞队，穿着锦绣的衣服，戴着华丽的头饰，在代表团车辆经过的时候，敲着大鼓、舞着五色彩带，热烈的跳着“楚巴谢玛”。这种歌舞在最近三十多年来只跳过三次，第一次是欢迎班禅额尔德尼回到西藏，第二次是庆祝拉萨到日喀则的公路通车。
    中央代表团进入市区以前，在日喀则东郊参加了当地人民举行的欢迎仪式。班禅额尔德尼在讲话中热烈欢迎代表团访问日喀则。他说：“这次中央代表团光临日喀则，将会使西藏内部和祖国各兄弟民族之间的团结愈加巩固和发展，促使日喀则地区各项建设事业更加发展，同时，更会促使我们胜利地进行各项改革，早日成立统一的西藏自治区，和祖国各兄弟民族一起过渡到繁荣幸福的社会主义社会。”陈毅在讲话中感谢班禅额尔德尼和日喀则地区全体僧俗人民的盛大欢迎，并代表中央人民政府和毛主席向日喀则全体市民问好。
    陪同代表团前来日喀则的有中共西藏工作委员会代书记、西藏军区司令员张国华，和西藏地方政府噶伦朵喀·彭措饶杰。
    中央代表团总团和第一分团在十一日路过雅鲁藏布江中游大竹卡（离日喀则八十公里）的时候，也受到了当地藏族人民的热烈欢迎。
    据新华社日喀则13日电　中央代表团总团和第一分团今天在日喀则人民广场举行了有一万五千多人参加的慰问大会。
    代表团副团长张经武首先代表毛主席、朱副主席、刘委员长和周总理，向日喀则地区党、政、军、民表示亲切的慰问。张经武说：“西藏自治区筹备委员会成立后，将使西藏走上日益发展、进步和日益繁荣幸福的新阶段，它一定能够完全实现更加团结更加统一的西藏自治区的光荣历史任务。”接着，他指出：“我们越团结、进步和发展，帝国主义分子和反动分子就会千方百计地来破坏我们的团结、进步和发展，因此我们必须百倍地提高警惕”。班禅堪布会议厅委员会主任委员詹东·计晋美讲话说，中央代表团到日喀则，带来了毛主席和全国各族人民的深切关怀和祖国的温暖，这将更加有力地鼓舞我们为建设繁荣的家乡和社会主义新西藏的信心。他说：我们全西藏人民要时刻警惕帝国主义的挑拨破坏阴谋，为胜利地进行民主改革，早日实现统一的西藏自治区，建设繁荣幸福的祖国的新西藏而奋斗。
    慰问大会中，中央代表团向班禅堪布会议厅委员会、中共西藏工委日喀则分工委和日喀则宗赠了旗和礼品。班禅堪布会议厅委员会向中央代表团和代表团十七个民族的团员分别献了旗，并且代班禅额尔德尼向代表团团长、国务院副总理陈毅赠送礼品。中共西藏工委日喀则分工委和日喀则宗，也向代表团献了旗。
    最后，随中央代表团赴藏的文艺工作队进行了慰问演出。
