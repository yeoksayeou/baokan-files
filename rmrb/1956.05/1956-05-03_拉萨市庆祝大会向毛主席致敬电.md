　　Lhasa City Celebration Assembly Sends a Salute Telegram to Chairman Mao

　　Respected Chairman Mao:
    The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has been established. Today, we, the monks and laypeople of all ethnic groups from all walks of life in Lhasa, are celebrating its establishment with extremely joyful hearts and reporting the good news to you.
    We all understand that the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region is a concentrated manifestation of the further great unity of all ethnic groups in the motherland and within Tibet. It leads us to gradually develop Tibet's politics, economy, and culture in the cause of socialist construction of the motherland, and to embark on the road to prosperity and happiness.
    Respected Chairman Mao, thanks to the correct leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and you, thanks to the leadership of our two Tibetan leaders, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, thanks to the leadership and assistance of the Tibet Working Committee of the CPC and the Tibet Military Region, and the conscientious implementation of the policy of national equality and freedom of religious belief by all the People's Liberation Army and staff members stationed in Tibet, we have today such a joyous event that everyone is celebrating, and we can see our tomorrow more clearly. We believe that the future joyous events for the Tibetan people will be even more numerous and greater.
    We, the Tibetan people living in the great family of the motherland, are like living in a spring of gentle breezes and warm sunshine. Our cause of unity, development, and progress will surely flourish and blossom with beautiful and vibrant flowers.
    Respected leader, in these days full of joy and happiness all over Tibet, let us express our heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and you, and to the people of all fraternal ethnic groups of the motherland!
    Long live our great motherland!

    Lhasa City All Ethnic Groups and Circles Celebration of the Establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region

　　拉萨市庆祝大会向毛主席致敬电
　　敬爱的毛主席：
    西藏自治区筹备委员会成立了，今天我们各族各界僧俗人民在拉萨以极为愉快的心情，热烈欢呼庆祝它的成立，并向您报喜。
    我们都明白：自治区筹备委员会的成立，是祖国各民族和西藏内部进一步大团结的集中表现。它领导着我们在祖国社会主义建设事业中，逐步地发展西藏的政治、经济和文化，走向繁荣幸福的大道。
    敬爱的毛主席，由于伟大的中国共产党、中央人民政府和您的正确领导，由于我们西藏人民两位领袖达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的领导，由于中共西藏工委和西藏军区的领导和帮助，以及全体进藏人民解放军和工作人员认真地执行了民族平等、宗教信仰自由政策，我们才有今天这样人人欢庆的大喜事，我们也更清楚地看到我们的明天，我们相信西藏人民未来的喜事还将会更多更大。
    我们生活在祖国大家庭中的西藏人民，如同生活在风和日暖的春天，我们的团结发展和进步的事业一定能欣欣向荣，开放出美丽鲜艳的花朵。
    敬爱的领袖，在这西藏到处充满欢欣愉快的日子里，让我们向中国共产党、中央人民政府和您、向祖国各兄弟民族人民表示衷心的感谢！
    我们伟大的祖国万岁！
