    Cotton Direct Seeding Marker
    Zhao Minggao, a member of the Communist Youth League of the Niujing Town Agricultural Production Cooperative in Binchuan County, Yunnan Province, with the specific help of the county's agricultural technology station, created a "cotton direct seeding marker," which has been widely welcomed by cotton farmers.
    This new farm tool can replace manual furrowing during sowing. In the past, manual furrowing allowed one person to furrow only two mu per day. With the marker, one person with an ox can furrow more than thirty mu per day. The use of this new farm tool not only saves a large amount of labor but also advances the cotton sowing time. Currently, Binchuan County has promoted this new farm tool in cotton-producing areas.

    棉花直播划行器
    云南省宾川县牛井镇农业生产合作社青年团员赵明高，在县农业技术站的具体帮助下，创制了“棉花直播划行器”，获得了棉农的普遍欢迎。
    这种新农具在播种时能代替人工打槽。过去人工打槽一个人一天只能打两亩，使用划行器，一个人一头牛一天能打三十亩以上。这一新农具的使用，不仅节省了大批劳力，同时还提早了棉花播种时间。目前宾川县已在产棉区推广这一新农具。
