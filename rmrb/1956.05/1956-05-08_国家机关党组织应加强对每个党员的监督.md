Party Organizations in State Organs Should Strengthen Supervision of Every Party Member
Zhao Han

In the high tide of the socialist revolution, striving to improve the quality of work in state organs is of very urgent significance. State organs are the leaders of economic and cultural construction, and the quality of their work directly affects the progress of national construction. The Communist Party members working in the organs are mostly responsible staff members in various positions, shouldering the important responsibilities of leaders and organizers of various tasks in the national construction cause. Therefore, striving to improve the ideological level of these party members and improve their work style is an important part of improving the quality of work in state organs. The main task of party organizations in state organs is to supervise all party members in the organs to strive to improve their theoretical and policy level, improve their work style, and improve their work ability. "This kind of supervision can help party members discover and correct their mistakes in time. Without this kind of supervision, a good party member may make serious mistakes and even become bad." (Resolution of the National Congress of the Communist Party of China on the Anti-Party Alliance of Gao Gang and Rao Shushi).

After the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, the supervision of party members by party organizations in state organs has been greatly strengthened, but many party organizations in state organs have not done enough in this regard; or have simply abandoned the supervision of party members. For example, the leadership of party members' study of Marxism-Leninism and the Party's guidelines and policies is still very infrequent and very unspecific. The struggle against dogmatism, conservative thinking, and bureaucracy among party members has not been carried out resolutely. Serious struggle and handling have not yet been carried out for the extravagance, waste, corruption, and degeneration of a few party members.

Why do some party organizations in state organs adopt this attitude towards the work of supervising party members? The main reason is that these party organizations do not have a clear understanding of their role and do not understand that they have the responsibility to supervise every party member in the organ. For example, some people believe that since the party organizations of state organs cannot exercise the power of supervising administrative work like the party organizations of enterprises, then they cannot supervise the party members in the organs. Some people think that even if the party organizations of the organs supervise the party members, it can only be partial. For example, "supervising party members can only supervise the thinking of party members, not the lives of party members," "supervising ordinary party members is okay, but supervising party members who do responsible work is not possible." "The level of the branch committee members is always lower than that of the administrative responsible cadres, so it is impossible to supervise the responsible cadres." Under the control of this kind of thinking, many party organizations in state organs only carry out daily tasks such as receiving party members, collecting party fees, and distributing documents, and almost completely abandoned the party's ideological and political work and abandoned the supervision of party members; or only supervised general party members, and abandoned the supervision of party members who did responsible work. This not only reduces the due role of party organizations, but also puts party organizations into the quagmire of事務主义.

To strengthen the supervision of party members in the organs, first of all, the staff of the organ's party organization must clearly understand their responsibilities—that they have the responsibility to supervise all party members. At the same time, strictly criticize the erroneous thinking that it is impossible to supervise party members who hold leadership positions. In the criticism, it must be made clear that due to the particularity of state organs, the party organizations of state organs cannot supervise the work of state organs, but the party members in state organs, including party members who do responsible work, should and must be supervised. Only by strengthening the supervision of the individual party members' ideology, work style, study, and life, and only by ensuring that each party member has the correct ideology, work style, and a certain level of political theory, can the smooth completion of the administrative work of the organs be guaranteed. At the same time, the supervision of party members must not distinguish between general cadres and responsible cadres. Any party member should abide by the Party Program and the Party Constitution, and any party member must live the life of the Party and accept the supervision of the party organization. Party organizations have the responsibility to supervise party members, party members have the responsibility to supervise party organizations, higher-level party organizations have the responsibility to supervise lower-level party organizations, lower-level party organizations have the responsibility to supervise higher-level party organizations, and party members have the responsibility to supervise other party members. There should not be a party member in our party who is not supervised by the party organization and the masses, nor should there be a party organization that is not supervised by the party members and the masses.

It is precisely because of the abandonment of the supervision of party members that phenomena such as lax labor discipline, chaotic work order, bureaucracy, and bureaucracy have occurred in these organs. These seriously hinder the completion of work tasks.

The main methods for party organizations in state organs to supervise party members are to strictly implement the party's organizational life and fully carry out criticism and self-criticism. However, the criticism and self-criticism within many party organizations is not very developed. At the general meeting of all party members, the instructions of the higher party committee are often only conveyed, and no attention is paid to carrying out criticism and self-criticism; even if criticism is carried out, only general party members carry out self-criticism, while party members who do responsible work do not carry out self-criticism, nor is there mutual criticism; although some state organs can expose and criticize some shortcomings and errors in various movements, criticism and self-criticism stop after the movement. Precisely because criticism and self-criticism are not developed or not frequent, the supervision of party members is not comprehensive or frequent. In this way, a small number of party members will inevitably make serious mistakes and even become bad.

The key to changing this situation lies in the fact that the party members who are responsible for the work of the organs must take the lead in carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and the party organization must promote this criticism in many ways. The party organization must expose and deal with those who dare to retaliate against critics. If the party organization does not actively promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism fully within the party organization, then the work of supervising party members will fail.

In order to strengthen the supervision of party members, the party organization must quickly improve its level of organizational work and ideological work. The higher the level of the party's organizational work and ideological work, the higher the political and ideological level of the party members and the masses, the more it can give play to the enthusiasm and initiative of the party members and the masses, and the more it can improve the level of awareness of the party members and the masses. The higher the degree of awareness of party members and the masses, the stronger the supervision of the party's work from the bottom up, and the more quickly the shortcomings and errors in the party's work and of each party member can be exposed and overcome. In this way, the organ's party organization will be able to more effectively strengthen the supervision of each party member and continuously improve the level of our party's life.

### 国家机关党组织应加强对每个党员的监督

　　国家机关党组织应加强对每个党员的监督
    赵汉
    在社会主义革命高潮中，努力提高国家机关工作的质量，具有非常迫切的意义。国家机关是经济建设和文化建设的领导者，工作的好坏，直接影响着国家建设事业的进行。在机关工作的共产党员，大部分都是各种岗位上的负责工作人员，担负着国家建设事业中各项工作的领导者和组织者的重大职责。因此，努力提高这些党员的思想水平，改进他们的工作作风，又是提高国家机关工作质量的一个重要环节。国家机关党组织的主要任务，是监督机关中的全体党员来努力提高自己的理论政策水平、改进工作作风和提高工作能力。“这种监督可以帮助党员及时地发现和改正自己的错误，没有这种监督，一个好的党员也可能犯严重的错误以至变坏。”（中国共产党全国代表会议关于高岗、饶漱石反党联盟的决议）。
    在党的七届四中全会以后，国家机关党组织对党员的监督有了很大的加强，但是还有不少机关党组织在这方面做得很不够；或者根本放弃了对党员的监督。例如对于党员的马克思列宁主义和党的方针政策的学习的领导，还是很不经常很不具体。对于党员中的教条主义、保守思想、官僚主义，还是没有进行坚决的斗争。对于少数党员的铺张浪费、腐化堕落，也还没有进行严肃的斗争和处理。
    为什么有些国家机关党组织对监督党员的工作采取这种态度呢？主要的原因，就是这些党组织对自己的作用认识得不够明确，不了解自己有对机关每个党员监督的责任。例如有些人认为既然国家机关党组织不能行使像企业党组织监督行政工作的职权，那末，也就不能对机关中的党员进行监督。有些人认为机关党组织即使对党员进行监督，也只能是局部的。比如说“监督党员只能监督党员的思想，不能监督党员的生活”，“监督一般党员还可以，监督做负责工作的党员就不成”。“支部委员的水平总低于行政负责干部，因此就不可能对负责干部实行监督”。在这种思想支配之下，不少国家机关党组织就只是进行接收党员、收缴党费、分发文件等日常工作，几乎完全放弃了党的思想政治工作，放弃了对党员的监督；或则只对一般党员进行监督，而放弃了对做负责工作的党员的监督。这样不但降低了党组织的应有的作用，而且使党组织陷于事务主义的泥坑。
    要加强对机关党员的监督，首先要使机关党组织的工作人员明确认识自己的职责——有监督全体党员的责任。同时对于那种认为不能对担负领导职务的党员进行监督的错误思想进行严格的批判。在批判中，要说清楚，由于国家机关的特殊性，国家机关的党组织是不能对国家机关的工作进行监督的，但对国家机关中的党员，包括做负责工作的党员是应该和必须加以监督的。只有加强了对党员个人的思想作风、学习和生活的监督，只有保证每个党员都具有了正确的思想作风和一定的政治理论水平，才能保证机关行政工作的顺利完成。同时，对党员的监督，决不能区分一般干部和负责干部，任何一个党员都应当遵守党纲党章，任何一个党员都必须过党的生活，接受党组织的监督。党组织对党员，党员对党组织，上级党组织对下级党组织，下级党组织对上级党组织，党员对党员都有互相监督的责任。在我们党内不应该有一个不受党组织和群众监督的党员，也不应该有一个不受党员和群众监督的党组织。
    正因为放弃了对党员的监督，在这些机关中就产生了劳动纪律松弛、工作秩序紊乱、官僚主义和文牍主义等现象。这些都严重地妨碍了工作任务的完成。
    国家机关党组织监督党员的主要方法是严格党的组织生活，充分开展批评和自我批评。但是现在有不少党组织内的批评和自我批评是不很开展的。在全体党员大会上，往往只是传达上级党委的指示，不注意开展批评和自我批评；即使进行批评也只是由一般党员进行自我批评，而做负责工作的党员是不进行自我批评的，也没有相互之间的批评；有些国家机关在各个运动中，虽然能够揭发和批判一些缺点和错误，但是在运动之后批评和自我批评又停顿起来了。正因为批评和自我批评不开展或不经常，对党员的监督也就不全面、不经常。这样，就必然有少数党员会犯严重错误，以至变坏。
    改变这种情况的关键，就在于做机关负责工作的党员，要以身作则地来开展批评和自我批评，而党组织就要从多方面来促进这种批评。对于那些敢于对批评者打击报复的人，党组织就要加以揭发和处理。党组织如果不积极在党组织内充分发扬民主，开展批评和自我批评，那末，监督党员的工作就会落空。
    为了加强对党员的监督，党组织就要迅速提高自己组织工作和思想工作的水平。党的组织工作和思想工作水平愈高，党员群众的政治思想水平愈高，就愈能发挥党员群众的积极性和主动性，就愈能提高党员群众的觉悟程度。党员群众的觉悟程度愈高，则自下而上的对党的工作的监督也将愈强，党的工作中和每个党员的缺点和错误也就愈能迅速地得到揭发和克服。这样机关党组织也就愈能有效地来加强对每个党员的监督，不断地把我们党的生活水平提高。
