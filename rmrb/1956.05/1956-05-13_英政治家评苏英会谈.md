Xinhua News Agency, May 12th - According to a Reuters report, British Prime Minister Eden said at a Conservative gathering in Perth, Scotland, on the 11th, that the visit of Soviet leaders to Britain was an action unseen in forty years, and he hoped to hold such talks with Soviet leaders again.

Eden said, "During this visit, we gave up nothing, nor did our Russian guests," "But we discussed, studied, and debated each other's policies. All of this continued for several days, which certainly increased our understanding of these issues and of each other." He said: "This is a clear achievement."

Eden continued: "My colleagues and I welcome the patience and thoroughness our guests adopted in discussing many issues. I look forward to holding such discussions with them again."

Eden also said that with each passing day, he "felt increasingly pleased" that he had invited Soviet leaders to visit Britain.

Eden expressed disagreement with the view held by some that it is foolish to talk with countries with differing opinions. He said: "It is far better to do everything you can to try to enable us to live our own way, rather than perish together in a nuclear war."

Xinhua News Agency, May 12th - TASS Ottawa News: The Ottawa "News" published an article on the 11th written by former British Labour Party leader Attlee about the visit of Bulganin and Khrushchev to Britain. Attlee wrote that the results of the talks in London by the Soviet state leaders created the possibility of greatly expanding trade between the Soviet Union and Britain, and laid the foundation for closer relations between the two countries.

Attlee believes that Eden's invitation to Bulganin and Khrushchev to visit Britain, while also accepting the Soviet leaders' invitation to visit the Soviet Union, was a wise move.

    英政治家评苏英会谈
    艾登：四十年来第一次
    新华社12日讯据路透社报道，英国首相艾登十一日在苏格兰伯斯的保守党人的集会上说，苏联领袖访问英国是四十年来所没有过的行动，他期望能和苏联领袖再举行这种会谈。
    艾登说，“在这次访问中，我们没有放弃任何东西，我们的俄国客人们也是这样”，“但是我们却讨论了，研究了而且争论了彼此的政策。所有这些继续了好些天，这当然增加了我们对这些问题的了解和相互间的了解”。他说：“这就是一个明显的成就。”
    艾登继续说：“我和我的同僚们都欢迎我们的客人们在讨论许多问题时所采取的耐心和彻底的精神。我期望能够同他们再举行这种讨论。”
    艾登还说，随着每天的过去，他对于他曾邀请苏联领袖们访问英国“越来越感到高兴”。
    艾登表示不同意有些人认为同意见不一致的国家会谈是愚蠢的看法。他说：“尽你所能作的一切来设法使得我们能够按照我们自己的方式生活，而不是在核子战争中彼此同归于尽，那是要好得多的。”
    艾德礼：产生了扩大贸易的可能性
    新华社12日讯　塔斯社渥太华讯：渥太华“新闻报”十一日刊登了英国工党前领袖艾德礼写的关于布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访问英国的一篇文章。艾德礼写道，苏联国家领导人在伦敦会谈的结果，产生了大大扩大苏联同英国的贸易的可能，并且为两国之间更密切的关系打下了基础。
    艾德礼认为，艾登邀请布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访问英国，同时接受了苏联领导人的关于访问苏联的邀请，这样做是明智的。
