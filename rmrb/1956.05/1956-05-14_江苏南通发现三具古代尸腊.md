    Three Ancient Corpses Discovered in Nantong, Jiangsu

    While constructing highways and opening up power irrigation channels in the Chuzhun Township suburbs of Nantong City, Jiangsu Province, three soft corpses from ancient times were excavated from two ownerless Ming Dynasty tombs. One site contained the corpses of Gu Neng, a hermit of the Ming Dynasty, and his wife, and the other contained the corpse of Gu Yao, a student of the Ming Dynasty.

    The tombs of Gu Neng and his wife, and Gu Yao, were all brick-built with three crypts and six vaults. Gu Neng's tomb, in addition to being constructed with three-earth mixture, also had rosin glued between the crypt and the outer coffin. Except for the boots Gu Neng wore, which were intact, the other clothes, although still retaining their shape, were too rotten to be picked up. Gu Neng's wife had a relatively intact silk handkerchief in her hand. Gu Neng's clothes pocket contained a sachet of spices, and a paper "guide to the netherworld," listing Gu Neng's birth and death dates and his residence. Both coffins of Gu Neng and his wife contained water, and the female corpse was still submerged in the water. The corpses of Gu Neng and his wife, and Gu Yao, were all very well-preserved, without decay, and still had beards and hair. The joints of the corpses were not stiff, and even the finger joints could be moved. All three corpses had a strange fragrance.

    The cultural relics discovered in the tomb of Gu Neng and his wife proved that Gu Neng was a hermit of the Ming Dynasty, and was granted a crown and jade belt with three ranks for his meritorious service in disaster relief. The tomb was built in the first year of Jiajing in the Ming Dynasty, dating back 435 years. Gu Yao's tomb was built in the 37th year of Jiajing in the Ming Dynasty, dating back 399 years. Gu Yao was a student at the age of thirteen, and was given the title of Tongyi Grand Master and Vice Censor-in-Chief of the Metropolitan Procuratorate because of his son Yangqian's nobility. Both tombs contained many pieces of gold, silver, and gemstone ornaments.

    These three soft corpses left from ancient times are scientifically called adipocere. They are now preserved in an ice cellar by the Subei Medical College. Professors at the Subei Medical College have examined these three corpses: cutting open Gu Neng's corpse from the right side, they found that the lung cavity had become a thin film attached to the back, the heart was only a bubble, and there were still intestinal tubes in the abdomen, but the liver and spleen were gone. The rectum still contained stool, which was blackish-purple. After slicing and observing under a microscope, they found that nerves, intestines, muscles, etc., still retained traces of the original cells, fibrous tissues, etc., and the cartilage cells were still like living bodies, with nuclei, which is a rare phenomenon. These three corpses are very helpful for scientific research. Currently, professors at the Subei Medical College are preparing to transplant the cartilage cells of the corpses into animals to test the cells' viability. (Xinhua News Agency)

    江苏南通发现三具古代尸腊
    江苏省南通市郊区褚准乡在修筑公路和开辟电力灌溉渠道时，在两处无主的明朝古坟挖掘出三具古代遗留下来的软尸体。一处是明代处士顾能夫妇的尸体，一处是明代诸生顾瑶的尸体。
    顾能夫妇和顾瑶的墓都是砖砌的三圹六穴，顾能墓除用三和土筑成外，在圹与椁之间还用松香胶着，除顾能穿的靴是完整的以外，其他衣服虽然形状还完好，但已腐烂不堪掇拾。顾能妻手有丝织手帕一方也较完好，顾能衣袋贮有香料布囊，并有“冥途路引单”一纸，上载顾能生卒年月及其住处等。顾能夫妇的棺中都有水，女尸还浸在水中。顾能夫妇及顾瑶尸体都很完好，没有腐烂，还留有须发，尸体关节都不僵硬，连手指关节都能转动。这三具尸体上都有一种异香。
    在顾能夫妇墓中发现的文物，证明顾能是明朝处士，以赈济功赐冠带貂玉加三品，墓在明嘉靖元年建成，距今四百三十五年。顾瑶墓建于明嘉靖三十七年，距今三百九十九年，顾瑶在十三岁补诸生，以子养谦贵，赠通仪大夫都察院副都御史。两个墓中都有金银宝石饰物等多件。
    这三具古代留下的软尸体，在科学上叫尸腊。现在都被苏北医学院保存在冰窖中。苏北医学院的教授对这三具尸腊进行了检查：从右侧面切开顾能尸体，发现肺腔成了一层薄膜贴在背上，心只剩了一个泡泡，腹内还有肠管，但肝、脾都没有了，直肠内还有大便，发黑紫色。经过切片在显微镜下观察的结果，发现神经、肠子、肌肉等都还保存原来的细胞、纤维组织等的痕迹，软骨细胞还像生活体一样，有细胞核，这是稀有的现象。这三具尸腊对科学研究工作很有帮助，目前苏北医学院的教授们正准备把尸腊的软骨细胞移植到动物身上，进行细胞生活能力的试验。（新华社）
