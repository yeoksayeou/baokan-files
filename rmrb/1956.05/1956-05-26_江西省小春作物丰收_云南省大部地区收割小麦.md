Jiangxi Province has had its best spring harvest in the seven years since liberation. According to reports from various locations, the province's more than 8 million mu of spring-harvested crops have largely completed or exceeded the planned production increase. The yield per unit area of barley, wheat, broad beans, peas, and other crops in the province increased by 10% to 23% compared to last year. Coupled with the increase in planting area, the total output of spring-harvested crops in the province this year, including rapeseed, is expected to increase by approximately 200 million jin compared to last year.

Currently, the harvesting of these crops has largely concluded. Many agricultural cooperatives are in the process of distribution. (Xinhua News Agency report)

More than 3.8 million mu of wheat in Yunnan Province has been mostly harvested. The general yield is around 300 jin per mu, with some areas in Chuxiong reaching as high as 1,000 jin. (Our correspondent in Kunming)

    江西省小春作物丰收
    云南省大部地区收割小麦
    今年是江西省解放七年来春收作物收成最好的一年。据各地汇报，全省八百多万亩春收作物大都完成或超额完成了预定的增产计划。全省大麦、小麦、蚕豆、豌豆等作物的单位面积产量比去年分别增加了10％到23％。加上播种面积的增加，今年全省春收作物的总产量，包括油菜籽在内，大约可以比去年增加两亿斤左右。
    目前，这些作物的收获工作大体上已经结束。许多农业合作社正在进行分配。　（据新华社讯）
    云南省的三百八十多万亩小麦，大部已经收割。一般产量每亩在三百斤左右，楚雄有些地方的产量高达一千斤。　（本报驻昆明记者）
