Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 26th. Starting yesterday, the Baolan Railway began laying tracks northward from Lanzhou. At dawn that day, hundreds of track-laying workers set foot on the newly built roadbed. They formed several work teams according to different types of work, some laying sleepers, some nailing rails. By noon, the track-laying project had reached the entrance of the first long tunnel on the railway's northward advance—the Donggang Town Tunnel.

It is expected that by the end of July this year, the track-laying workers can complete the track-laying task stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan and reach Dijiatai.

    包兰铁路从兰州向北铺轨
    据新华社兰州26日电　从昨天起，包兰铁路开始自兰州向北铺轨。当日天刚黎明，数百个铺轨工人就踏上了新修好的路基。他们按不同工种分别组成几个工班，有的放枕木，有的钉钢轨，到中午为止，铺轨工程到达了铁路线北进的第一座长隧道——东岗镇隧道的洞口。
    预计到今年七月底为止，铺轨工人可以完成第一个五年计划规定的铺轨任务，到达狄家台。
