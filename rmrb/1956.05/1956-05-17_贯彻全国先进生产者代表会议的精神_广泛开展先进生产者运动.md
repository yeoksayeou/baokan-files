Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: Advanced producers from the commercial system, 220 of whom attended the National Conference of Advanced Producers, today proposed a socialist emulation drive to employees in the national commercial sector.

125 salespersons including Wu Guilan proposed a socialist emulation drive among stores, sales teams, and salespersons. The proposal stated: We firmly respond to the call of the Central Committee with practical actions, implement the spirit of the National Conference of Advanced Producers, actively improve service quality, improve business management, conscientiously study the needs of the people, and better serve production and consumers. They put forward specific competition conditions among stores, sales teams, and salespersons.

Eighty advanced producers in warehouse management work, including Pan Rui, proposed a socialist emulation drive among warehouses, storage teams, and warehouse keepers in the Ministry of Commerce system. In their proposal, they stated: With the rapid development of industry and the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, the supply and demand in the market are greatly increasing. To adapt to this situation, we must continuously improve the utilization rate of warehouses, expand the storage of goods, ensure the safety of the goods stored, and continuously reduce the loss rate of goods. They put forward competition conditions among warehouses and storage teams, and warehouse keepers.

Eleven advanced workers in wholesale procurement work also proposed a socialist emulation drive among wholesale stations (including procurement and supply stations) in the Ministry of Commerce system. They put forward five competition conditions.

Six advanced producers in financial accounting work also put forward proposals. In view of the current chaotic state of property in commercial departments and the considerable losses and waste, they proposed to completely reverse this phenomenon through socialist emulation and accumulate funds for the country. They put forward five specific competition conditions.

The heads of the Ministry of Commerce and the All-China Federation of Commercial Trade Unions expressed their full support for the proposals of the advanced producers and decided to use the conditions in these proposals as the main conditions for employees in the Ministry of Commerce system to carry out socialist emulation.

    Imparting Newly Learned Advanced Experience

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, May 16th: Twenty-five advanced producers in the machinery industry who attended the Advanced Producers Representative Conference in Beijing are imparting newly learned advanced experience to mechanical workers in Harbin. Ning Fu'an, an advanced lathe operator from Harbin No. 1 Tool Factory, borrowed a machine tool from the experimental factory of Harbin Institute of Technology to accelerate the production of five advanced tools learned this time, such as plum blossom centers and sleeve cutters. He plans to pass this technology on to the city's lathe operators in a short period of time. Wang Xiyou, an advanced foundry worker from the jointly owned Qunli Machinery Factory, has compiled a document on the advanced casting experience of Shanghai Turbine Factory and Wuxi Machine Tool Factory and is preparing to convey it to the city's foundry workers, using this experience to solve the problem of high rejection rates of castings. Wu Guangcheng, an advanced driller from the local state-owned Songjiang Machinery Factory, demonstrated the Soviet Siroff high-speed drilling and flat drilling to representatives of drillers from mechanical factories throughout the city on the 9th. He used a high-speed drill to drill through a forty-millimeter-thick casting in four seconds, eight times more efficient than in the past. Hua Weiping, a veteran driller at Harbin No. 1 Tool Factory, learned this high-speed drilling on the spot and drilled through the casting in just three seconds.

    Beijing Municipality Formulates a Plan for Dissemination and Publicity

Xinhua News Agency, May 16th: The Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has formulated a plan to widely disseminate and publicize the spirit of the National Conference of Advanced Producers Representatives throughout the city.

The plan stipulates five main points of propaganda, requiring trade union organizations at all levels to use all propaganda tools. Each enterprise, with the workshop or group as a unit, should widely read the "Letter from All Representatives of the National Conference of Advanced Producers to Workers across the Country" so that every worker can see or hear this letter.

The plan requires representatives who attended the National Conference of Advanced Producers to express their feelings and convey the advanced deeds that impressed them the most to the workers around them in various ways, such as symposiums, evening parties, and broadcasts, after returning to their units. Full-time trade union cadres at all levels in the city began to study the main documents of the National Conference of Advanced Producers on the 15th. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions will also make a report to the city's workers through broadcasting recently.
