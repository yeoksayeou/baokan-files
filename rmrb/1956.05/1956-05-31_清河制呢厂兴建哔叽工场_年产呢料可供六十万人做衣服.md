    Qinghe Woolen Mill Builds Serge Factory
    Annual Production of Woolen Fabric Enough for 600,000 People to Make Clothes
    The Qinghe Woolen Mill in Beijing is building a serge factory, currently the largest in scale domestically. It will produce a large quantity of various fine serge, doeskin, gabardine, and tweed, with an annual production of woolen fabric sufficient for more than 600,000 people to each make a set of clothes.
    This newly built serge factory will be equipped with 10,000 spindles and 144 new-type looms. Among the looms are high-speed roving frames that can produce 60 meters of wool top per minute, twice the efficiency of the original roving frames. In addition, there are automatically temperature-controlled dyeing machines and drying machines to ensure product quality.
    The deputy director of the Qinghe Woolen Mill told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that the serge factory is planned to take only one year from design to completion, and test production is expected to begin in the second quarter of 1957. To ensure timely completion, the factory building will adopt prefabricated assembled construction. After its completion, together with the existing woolen mill, plush mill, and serge mill, the Qinghe Woolen Mill will become a very large combined factory. (Xinhua News Agency)

    清河制呢厂兴建哔叽工场
    年产呢料可供六十万人做衣服
    北京清河制呢厂正在兴建一座目前国内规模最大的哔叽工场。它将大量生产各种各样细致的哔叽、凡尔丁、华达呢和花呢，每年生产的呢料能供给六十多万人各做一套衣服。
    这座新建的哔叽工场内将安装一万纱锭，一百四十四台新型的织机。织机中有高速度的粗纱机，每分钟能出毛条六十公尺，比原来粗纱机的效率高一倍。另外，还有自动控制温度的染呢机和烤呢机，能保证产品质量。
    清河制呢厂副厂长告诉新华社记者说，这座哔叽工场从设计到建成，计划只要一年时间，预计在1957年第二季度就能试车生产。为了按期建成，场房准备采取预制构件的装配式建筑。它建成以后，连同原有的毛呢场、长毛绒场和哔叽场，将使清河制呢厂成为一个规模很大的联合工厂。　（新华社）
