Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th. The investigation work of the Tropical Economic Crops Investigation Team of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in Hainan Island has been completed.

After more than half a month of investigation, the working group believes that Hainan Island has very favorable conditions for planting tropical economic crops. They have applied to the relevant departments for wasteland to be used as a base for overseas Chinese investment and reclamation.

During their stay in Hainan Island, the working group conducted extensive research on the distribution of wasteland, soil, water conservancy, transportation, and the growth of various tropical plants in the eastern coastal areas and central hilly areas. The results of the research show that the average temperature in most parts of Hainan Island is between 24 and 28 degrees Celsius. The area around Wanning and Baoting, with its fertile land, ample rainfall, and suitable temperature, is an excellent place to grow tropical economic crops such as rubber, sisal, sugarcane, coconut, oil palm, citronella, coffee, and pepper.

The working group focused on inspecting the state-owned Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm, the Xinmin Rubber Company, and the Qiaofu Company, which are operated with overseas Chinese investment. They found that various tropical economic crops at the Xinglong Overseas Chinese Farm were growing very well. Most of the rubber trees planted by the Xinmin Rubber Company are developing healthily and growing rapidly. The Qiaofu Company is also preparing to cultivate a large number of excellent varieties. Some members of the working group also visited the old rubber plantations on the island. There are rubber forests that were planted more than 40 years ago, and they are currently producing a large amount of rubber. Many excellent parent trees have extremely high yields. One of these parent trees is a rare high-yielding tree in the world. The latex produced by it each year, if put in a large barrel, would require two people to lift. These old rubber trees were planted in the past by overseas Chinese who brought seeds back from Southeast Asia. Now, these rubber trees have fully adapted to the natural conditions of Hainan Island and have bred many native excellent offspring.

    海南岛是种植热带经济作物的好地方
    侨委调查组申请荒地作为华侨投资垦殖的基地
    新华社广州17日电　中央华侨事务委员会热带经济作物调查工作组在海南岛的调查工作已经完毕。
    工作组经过半个多月来的调查，认为在海南岛种植热带经济作物具有很优越的条件。他们已向有关方面申请荒地，作为华侨投资垦殖的基地。
    工作组在海南岛期间，曾对东部沿海地区和中部丘陵地带的荒地分布、土壤、水利、交通和各种热带植物的生长状况作了广泛的研究。研究的结果表明，海南岛绝大部分地区平均温度在摄氏二十四度至二十八度间。万宁、保亭一带地肥雨足，气温适宜，更是种植橡胶、剑麻、甘蔗、椰子、油棕、香茅、咖啡、胡椒……等热带经济作物的好地方。
    工作组在重点考察了国营兴隆华侨农场和华侨投资经营的新民橡胶公司、侨福公司。他们发现兴隆华侨农场各种热带经济作物都生长得很好；新民橡胶公司种植的胶树大多数发育健全，生长迅速；侨福公司也正在准备大量培育优良品种。工作组部分人员还参观了岛上的老胶园。那里有种植四十多年的胶林，目前正在大量割胶，许多优良母树的产量极高。其中有一株母树是世界上罕有的高产树，每年所产的胶汁，如果装在一个大桶里，要两个人才能抬得动。这些老胶树都是过去华侨从南洋带种子回来栽植的，现在这些胶树已经完全适应了海南岛的自然条件，并且已经繁殖出许多土生土长的优良后代。
