The CPC Jiangsu Provincial Committee issued instructions on May 7 regarding the development of sideline production by agricultural production cooperatives. It requires all regions to develop sideline production while simultaneously developing agricultural production, and to pay attention to saving non-productive expenditures, striving to increase the actual income of more than 90% of cooperative members.

The instructions require that the production cooperative departments of the CPC regional committees and county committees should have a deputy director specifically in charge of sideline production, and that agricultural cooperatives should have at least one deputy director specifically in charge of sideline production, to strengthen specific leadership over sideline production.

Regarding the principles for agricultural cooperatives to engage in sideline production, the instructions stipulate that, under the principles of not engaging in commercial speculation and balancing production and sales, agricultural cooperatives and members should be allowed to continue to operate any sideline businesses that farmers have operated in the past. Relevant departments should not only refrain from interfering, but also provide strong support in terms of raw material supply, technical guidance, and product promotion.

At the same time, agricultural cooperatives must develop sideline production in accordance with local conditions and the specific circumstances of the cooperatives, making full use of local natural resources, economic resources, surplus labor, and the technical foundation of the masses, so that they can easily achieve the requirements of spending less money, achieving quick results, and generating large returns. Labor remuneration for agricultural cooperatives' sideline production should be reasonably assessed. Work quotas should be formulated according to different seasons, different sideline characteristics, and different skill levels. Some sideline industries can also implement contracting for work, capital, and output. Technical allowances should be given to personnel with special skills.

In the instructions, the Provincial Committee charged relevant business departments with conducting a comprehensive review of the purchase prices of sideline products, appropriately adjusting the purchase prices of sideline products and improving purchase methods, and correcting some of the existing unreasonable phenomena.

    中共江苏省委指示各地开展副业生产
    中共江苏省委于五月七日发出关于农业生产合作社发展副业生产的指示，要求各地在发展农业生产的同时，开展副业生产并注意节省非生产性的开支，力争90％以上的社员增加实际收入。
    指示中要求中共地委会和县委会的生产合作部都要有一个副部长分工专管副业生产，农业社至少要有一个副社长专管副业生产，加强对副业生产的具体领导。
    对农业社经营副业的原则，指示中规定，在不进行商业投机和产销平衡的原则下，凡是过去农民所经营的副业，都应该允许社和社员继续经营。各有关部门不仅不应该干涉，而且要在原料供应、技术指导、产品推销等方面大力予以支持。
    同时，农业社发展副业生产，必须因地因社制宜，充分利用当地的自然资源、经济资源、剩余劳动力和群众的技术基础，这样就能比较容易地达到花钱少、收效快、收益大的要求。对于农业社的副业生产的劳动报酬，应该合理评定。要根据不同季节、不同的副业特点和技术的高低，制订工种定额，有些副业还可以实行包工包本包产，对于有特殊技术的人员，应给予技术津贴。
    省委在指示中责成有关业务部门对副业产品的收购价格进行一次全面检查，适当调整副业产品的收购价格和改进收购方法，纠正目前存在的某些不合理现象。（本报驻南京记者）
