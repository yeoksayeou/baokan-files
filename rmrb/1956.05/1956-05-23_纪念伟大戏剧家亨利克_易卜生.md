Commemorating the Great Playwright Henrik Ibsen
Pan Jiaxun

Henrik Ibsen was Norway's most outstanding poet and playwright, and one of the world's most creative great playwrights. He was born on March 20, 1828, in Skien, a coastal town in southeastern Norway. His father was a wealthy local merchant, but he went bankrupt when Ibsen was eight years old, becoming too poor to send his son to a good local school. The hardships of life and the fickleness of the world left permanent scars on the sensitive and precocious child's mind. At the age of fifteen, Ibsen was sent by his father to work as an apprentice in a pharmacy in Grimstad. This small town was a shipbuilding center, and the pillars of local society were some shipyard owners and wealthy merchants. These people were mostly greedy, deceitful, snobbish, and vulgar hypocrites. Closely linked to this philistine atmosphere were the forces of the church and the authoritative traditions of old morality. These circumstances inevitably had a significant impact on Ibsen's early spiritual life and were later fully reflected in his works, especially in the plays "The League of Youth," "The Pillars of Society," and "An Enemy of the People."

In 1848, revolutionary movements and national liberation movements broke out simultaneously throughout Europe. The great storm blew to the small Norwegian seaport, arousing the political enthusiasm of this pharmacy apprentice. That year, two events had a particularly great influence on Ibsen. The first was the storming of the royal palace by the revolutionary masses in Paris in February, ousting King Louis-Philippe and establishing the Second French Republic. For this, Ibsen held a party with friends, delivering speeches and praising the republican system as "the only possible political system." The second event was the First Schleswig War, caused by Prussia's desire to seize the two provinces of Schleswig and Holstein. This angered Ibsen, and he immediately called on the three Scandinavian countries to unite and resist foreign aggression. He said that if Norway and Sweden did not send troops to aid Denmark, it would be the most shameful act of cowardice in the world. For this, he wrote a long poem titled "Wake Up, Scandinavia!"

In 1850, Ibsen left Grimstad for the capital, Christiania (now Oslo). At that time, his heart was filled with the fighting spirit of striving for freedom of thought and freedom of publication. He participated in student demonstrations held to rescue a young playwright persecuted by the government, and he also participated in the workers' movement led by the Norwegian revolutionary Stein. He wrote articles and worked as an editor for this organization's newspaper. Soon, Stein was arrested, the newspaper office was sealed, and Ibsen was almost arrested by the police as well. From then on, he concentrated on undertaking the important task of raising the people's ideological level through literary creation.

In 1864, the Second Schleswig War broke out, and Norway still did not send troops to aid Denmark, eventually causing Denmark to lose territory and troops. Ibsen left Norway in anger and lived in Italy and Germany for twenty-six or seven years, only returning twice in between. During his return to the country in 1885, he gave a speech. He said that the social reform movements being carried out in Europe at that time mainly involved the future status of workers and women. Although he had never directly written about the worker issue in his plays, he had always been regarded by workers as a powerful ally in their movement to improve political and economic conditions. In his plays, the women's issue occupied a large proportion. Many of the protagonists of his plays were women. He created nearly twenty distinctive female characters. He was a writer who strongly advocated women's liberation. He believed that to transform society, it was first necessary to liberate women; the significance of women's liberation was to enable women to obtain freedom and the same rights as men. Politically, Ibsen greatly despised the political parties of the time, so both the Conservative Party and the Radical Party disliked him.

Ibsen wrote more than twenty plays, which can be roughly divided into three categories. The first category is romantic heroic plays based on Norwegian history and folk tales, such as "Lady Inger of Ostrat," "The Vikings at Helgeland," and "The Pretenders," the purpose of which was to stimulate the Norwegian people's patriotism, to strive for unity internally, and to strive for national liberation externally. The second category mainly includes two poetic dramas: "Brand" and "Peer Gynt." Brand is an extremist who pursues inner perfection and spiritual freedom. Peer Gynt is a solipsistic fantasist from a peasant background. "Brand" depicts the conflict between the ideological consciousness of bourgeois intellectuals and the realistic demands of bourgeois society under the living conditions of Norway at that time. "Peer Gynt," in addition to touching on many practical political issues, mainly portrays the cowardice, selfishness, cruelty, accommodation, compromise, and other characteristics that existed in the average person at that time. The third category is social problem plays, including "The League of Youth," "The Pillars of Society," "A Doll's House," "Ghosts," "An Enemy of the People," "The Wild Duck," and "Hedda Gabler." These plays reflect the lives of small farmers and the petty bourgeoisie liberated from the shackles of feudalism. Their characters are mainly lawyers, doctors, journalists, civil servants, priests, artists, housewives, and a few shipyard owners and entrepreneurs. With his incomparably sharp pen, Ibsen boldly and ruthlessly exposed the moral degradation of the Norwegian petty bourgeoisie, the irrationality of marriage, the hypocrisy of family life, the vulgar and narrow-mindedness of thought, and the bankruptcy of bourgeois democracy. The characters who are negated in the plays are often not the so-called bad people of the old society; on the contrary, they are characters who are called social models or who do not seem to have major problems in the eyes of the average person. Although the author describes the general situation in Norway, he touches on the essence of Western European bourgeois social reality, and broadly raises issues such as politics, economy, morality, family, marriage, the relationship between men and women, and the relationship between the individual and society.

Ibsen's plays have a very clear ideological tendency. He advocates striving for individual freedom and liberating individuality. He said that metabolism is the inevitable law of social development, and the conflict between the new and the old is forever present; the life of a truth is at most twenty years, and new things and new ideas will inevitably encounter stubborn obstruction from old things and old ideas when they are in their infancy. Therefore, supporting the truth should be a never-ending task of struggle. Ibsen does not believe that society can be transformed by piecemeal methods, nor does he believe that the bourgeois democratic system can undertake the task of transforming society. However, he was limited by his own ideological weaknesses and could not grasp the proletarian worldview. Therefore, the "spiritual revolution" that he vigorously advocated could only be limited to the small world of the individual, and could not find a way out in politics.

Ibsen's plays were introduced to China during the May Fourth era and played some positive role at that time. However, representatives of bourgeois thought, such as Hu Shih, used Ibsen to peddle their despicable individualism, attempting to lure the masses away from politics and oppose the rising revolutionary liberation movement. There were indeed some individualistic tendencies in the development of Ibsen's thought, but the same idea can have different natures and play different roles under different specific historical conditions. In Ibsen's time, individualism had its progressive significance; in the May Fourth era, individualism became a reactionary idea that hindered the revolution.

Years of diligent practice cultivated Ibsen's dramatic art. He was a great dramatic innovator who inaugurated a new era for modern drama. In terms of modern drama, Ibsen's own achievements and influence on others are second to none. Ibsen's greatest contribution to modern drama is, first of all, that he reformed the themes and content of drama. He brought issues of personal concern to everyone at the time to the stage, so that after leaving the theater, the audience continued to think and discuss the issues in the play as their own. In Ibsen's plays, the discussion of issues occupies an important position. Secondly, the transformation of the themes and content of drama inevitably leads to the transformation of dramatic artistic techniques. Ibsen disdained using the disguises, murders, duels, and other thrilling scenes and unexpected events popular on the stage at that time to attract the audience. His plays have a tight structure, concentrated plots, prominent themes, and few characters. He is good at using flashback techniques to reveal the past layer by layer, and his first act is often equivalent to Shakespeare's fifth act.

Ibsen returned to live in Norway in 1891 and died on May 23, 1906. Today is the fiftieth anniversary of his death. When we commemorate this playwright, we should learn from his fighting spirit of supporting freedom and truth and opposing old ideas and old things. At the same time, we should also learn from his innovative and original spirit in dramatic content and artistic techniques. (Attached picture)

    纪念伟大戏剧家亨利克·易卜生
    潘家洵
    亨利克·易卜生是挪威最出色的诗人、戏剧家，也是世界上最富于创造性的伟大戏剧家之一。1828年3月20日，他生在挪威东南海滨斯基恩城。父亲是本地大商人，可是在易卜生八岁时破了产，穷得没有力量送儿子进本地的好学校。生活的艰苦和世态的炎凉在这敏感早熟孩子的心灵上留下了永久的创伤。易卜生在十五岁时候被父亲送到格利姆斯达城药店里当学徒。这座小城是一个造船业中心，本地社会的支柱是一些船厂老板和大商人。这批人大都是贪婪欺诈、势利鄙俗的伪君子。跟这种市侩气息紧密结合的还有教会势力和旧道德传统权威。这些情况在易卜生早年精神生活上不能不发生重大影响，并且后来都充分反映在他的作品里，特别是在“青年同盟”，“社会支柱”和“人民公敌”几个剧本里。
    1848年，欧洲各地同时爆发革命运动和民族解放运动。大风暴吹到了挪威的小海港，激起了这个药店小学徒的政治热情。那年有两件事对于易卜生的影响特别大。第一件是，二月间巴黎革命群众进攻皇宫，撵走国王路易·菲力普，建立法兰西第二共和国。为了这事，易卜生跟朋友举行酒会，发表演说，称赞共和政体为“唯一可能的政体”。第二件是，由于普鲁士想夺取石勒苏益格与荷尔斯泰恩两个省份而引起的第一次普鲁士丹麦战争。这事激怒了易卜生，他马上号召斯堪的纳维亚半岛三个国家联合起来抵御外侮。他说，要是挪威瑞典不出兵援助丹麦，那简直是天地间最可耻的怯懦行为。为了这事，他写了一首长诗，题目叫“醒醒吧，斯堪的纳维亚人！”
    1850年，易卜生离开格利姆斯达到了首都克立斯替阿尼遏（现在叫奥斯陆）。那时他心里充满了争取思想自由和出版自由的战斗热情。他参加过为营救一位被政府迫害的青年剧作家而举行的学生示威运动，也参加过挪威革命党人斯泰恩领导的工人运动。他给这个组织的报纸写文章当编辑。不久，斯泰恩被捕，报馆查封，易卜生也几乎被警察抓去。从此以后，他就集中精力担负起用文艺创作提高人民思想水平的重大任务。
    1864年，第二次普鲁士丹麦战争爆发，挪威仍然不出兵援助，终于使丹麦丧师失地。易卜生一怒而离开挪威，在意大利和德国住了二十六、七年，中间只回来过两次。在1885年那次回国时候，他发表过一个演说。他说，当时在欧洲进行的社会改造运动主要牵涉着工人和妇女的将来地位。他虽然没在剧本里正面写过工人问题，可是一直被工人认为是他们争取改善政治经济条件运动中的一个有力的同盟者。在他的剧本里，妇女问题却占了很大的比重。许多剧本的主角都是女人。他创造了将近二十个个性鲜明的女性人物。他是一个竭力主张妇女解放的作家。他认为要改造社会，首先必须解放妇女；解放妇女的意义就是要使妇女获得自由与和男人同等的做人权利。在政治上，易卜生非常鄙视当时的政党，因此保守党和急进党都不喜欢他。
    易卜生写过二十几个剧本，大致可分为三类。第一类是根据挪威历史和民间传说写成的浪漫英雄剧本，如“厄斯特罗特的英格夫人”、“海尔格伦的海盗”和“觊觎王位的人”等，目的在于激发挪威人民的爱国情绪，对内争取统一团结，对外争取民族解放。第二类主要是两个诗剧：“布朗德”和“培尔·金特”。布朗德是一个追求内心完善和精神自由的极端主义者。培尔·金特是一个农民出身的唯我主义幻想家。“布朗德”描写的是在当时挪威的生活条件下资产阶级知识分子的思想意识与资产阶级社会现实要求发生的冲突。“培尔·金特”，除了接触到许多实际政治问题之外，主要刻画了在当时一般人身上存在的怯懦、自私、残忍、迁就、妥协等等性格。第三类是社会问题剧本，包括“青年同盟”，“社会支柱”，“玩偶之家”，“群鬼”，“人民公敌”，“野鸭”，“海达·高布东”等作品。这些剧本反映的是从封建主义枷锁里解放出来的小农和小资产阶级的生活面貌。它们的角色主要是律师，医生，新闻记者，公务员，教士，艺术家，家庭妇女，少数船厂老板和企业家。易卜生用犀利无比的笔锋，大胆无情地暴露挪威中小资产阶级道德的堕落，婚姻的不合理，家庭生活的虚伪，思想的庸俗偏隘和资产阶级民主政治的破产。剧本里被否定的角色往往不是旧社会的所谓坏人，相反地，他们是被称为社会模范或者在一般人看来没多大问题的人物。作者描写的虽然是挪威的一般情况，可是他触到了西欧资产阶级社会现实的本质，广泛地提出了政治、经济、道德、家庭、婚姻、男女的相互关系，个人与社会的相互关系等等问题。
    易卜生戏剧的思想倾向非常鲜明。他主张争取个人自由，解放个性。他说，新陈代谢是社会发展的必然规律，新与旧的冲突是永远存在的；一个真理的寿命至多不过二十年，新事物新思想在萌芽的时候必然会遭受旧事物旧思想的顽强阻挠，因此，拥护真理应该是一个永不停止的战斗任务。易卜生不相信社会可以用点点滴滴的方法改造，他也不相信资产阶级民主制度可以担当改造社会的任务。然而他被自己的思想弱点所限制，不能掌握无产阶级的世界观。因此，他所竭力主张的“精神上的革命”只能局限在个人的小天地里，在政治上找不着出路。
    易卜生的戏剧是五四时代被介绍到中国来的，当时曾起过一些积极作用。可是资产阶级思想的代表胡适之流却利用易卜生贩卖他们的卑鄙个人主义，企图引诱群众脱离政治，反对正在高涨的革命解放运动。在易卜生的思想发展过程中确是存在着一些个人主义的倾向，可是同一种思想在不同的具体历史条件下可以有不同的性质，可以起不同的作用。在易卜生所处的时代，个人主义有它的进步意义，在五四时代，个人主义就变成了阻碍革命的反动思想。
    多年的勤苦实践培养了易卜生的戏剧艺术。他是一位伟大的戏剧革新家，给近代戏剧开创了一个新纪元。在近代戏剧方面，易卜生自己的成就和对别人的影响都是首屈一指的。易卜生对于近代戏剧的最大贡献首先是，他改革了戏剧的题材和内容。他把与当时人人有关的切身问题搬上舞台，使观众在走出剧院之后，把剧中问题当作自己的问题继续思索讨论。在易卜生剧本里，讨论问题占据了重要的地位。其次，戏剧题材内容的变革不可避免地会引起戏剧艺术技巧的变革。易卜生不屑利用当时舞台上流行的乔装、谋杀、决斗以及其他惊险场面和意外事件来吸引观众。他的剧本结构严密，情节集中，主题突出，人物不多。他善于采取追溯的手法把过去的事层层揭开，他的第一幕戏往往相当于莎士比亚的第五幕。
    1891年易卜生回到挪威居住，1906年5月23日逝世。今天是他逝世五十周年的日子。我们在纪念这位戏剧家的时候应该学习他拥护自由与真理和反对旧思想旧事物的战斗精神，同时我们还应该学习他在戏剧内容和艺术技巧上的革新独创精神。（附图片）
