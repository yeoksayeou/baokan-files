Xinhua News Agency, Bandung, May 30th. The Asian-African Student Conference opened in Bandung this morning. Attending the opening ceremony were 120 delegates from 25 student delegations representing Afghanistan, Burma, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Ceylon, the People's Republic of China, Indonesia, India, Iran, Japan, Laos, Malaya, Nepal, Pakistan, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Philippines, Syria, Algeria, Cameroon, Egypt, Madagascar, Morocco, Senegal and West Africa, Sudan, Tunisia, and Togo.

    At the opening session, President Sukarno's recorded message of congratulations to the Asian-African Student Conference was broadcast.

    Sukarno said that like the Asian-African Conference held a year ago, which inspired the current conference, the Asian-African Student Conference is also a historically significant meeting. For the first time in history, students from these countries are freely gathering together, on their own continent, to discuss issues of concern to every young person in every country.

    Sukarno said, why hold such a meeting? I think a very important reason is that we in Asia and Africa do not understand each other very well. This is not entirely our fault, but simply another evil consequence of the most wicked thing in all political situations – colonialism. For many generations, we have been taught to look to the West for inspiration and guidance. We have been isolated from our suffering brothers by obstacles erected around us – both real and spiritual. Now there is an opportunity to restore contacts that were interrupted long ago. Now there is an opportunity to tear down these artificial barriers and get to know each other again.

    Sukarno said that although you come from places with different backgrounds, this does not prevent mutual understanding and cooperation. Do not look for the differences between you, but seek your common ground, seek the common contribution you can make to the cause of peace and happiness.

    Sukarno said that simply your gathering together, talking to each other, understanding each other, and respecting each other more, these things will be very important.

    Sukarno said that our world is a world full of tensions, most of which are due to colonialism and fear arising from misunderstanding. If war should once again shock this fear-filled world, then everything we have strived for and everything we hope to achieve will be destroyed.

    Sukarno asked, why can't mankind eradicate this evil of colonialism and this disaster of war from the world?

    Sukarno said, what mankind can create, mankind can eliminate! What mankind can create, mankind can control! We can stop colonialism! We can stop war! We can prevent war from breaking out, and we can establish freedom everywhere.

    Sukarno said that one fundamental element needed to achieve this goal is cooperation, and a fundamental element of cooperation is mutual understanding.

    Sukarno said that if millions of Asian and African young intellectuals understand each other, respect each other, and cooperate with each other, they can prevent many evil deeds in the world.

    Sukarno finally congratulated the conference on its success and hoped that this conference would become another milestone on the road to security and happiness for Asia, Africa, and all mankind.

    Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo spoke at the meeting. He asked the representatives attending the meeting to do their best to uphold the "Bandung Spirit" established at the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung last year.

    He said that what brings Asian and African students together is "confidence in our destiny, confidence in our development and strength, and confidence that true progress can be achieved through cooperation and mutual understanding coupled with great ideas." He said that there are still some people who would like to see student representatives quarreling with each other, but he is convinced that the spirit of the Bandung Conference will prevail. He believes that the issues discussed at the Asian-African Student Conference should not be contradictions and differences of opinion, but ways to realize common ideals and solve common difficulties.

    He wished the Asian-African Student Conference success.

    Subandi, Chairman of the Indonesian National Preparatory Committee for the Asian-African Student Conference, said in his speech that we are meeting here not just to meet each other, but to create a new atmosphere, a new attitude of mutual understanding and mutual respect, so that effective and friendly cooperation can be realized among students from Asian and African countries.

    In this regard, we will take the achievements of the Bandung Prime Ministers' Conference in April last year as a guide, and the "Bandung Spirit" will also serve as the basis for all discussions at our Asian-African Student Conference.

    He pointed out, "Serving our respective countries means seeking unity rather than quarrels. Therefore, it is not necessary to promote one's ideas and the political system of one country at this conference, although there are indeed differences among us. Let us not seek differences, but seek common ground. Let us only discuss real student problems. Indeed, there are still many student problems to be solved."

    Subandi expressed his gratitude for the congratulatory messages from government leaders of Asian and African countries such as Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, and Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser.

    为亚非青年的合作和世界和平事业作出共同贡献
    亚非学生会议在万隆开幕
    新华社万隆30日电　亚非学生会议今天上午在万隆开幕。参加开幕式的有二十五个学生代表团的一百二十名代表，这些代表团来自阿富汗、缅甸、越南民主共和国、锡兰、中华人民共和国、印度尼西亚、印度、伊朗、日本、老挝、马来亚、尼泊尔、巴基斯坦、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、菲律宾、叙利亚、阿尔及利亚、喀麦隆、埃及、马达加斯加、摩洛哥、塞内加尔和西非、苏丹、突尼斯和多哥。
    在开幕会议上广播了苏加诺总统对亚非学生会议的录音祝词。
    苏加诺说，像一年以前举行的、给目前这次会议以启发的亚非会议一样，亚非学生会议也是一个具有历史意义的会议。在历史上，这些国家的学生第一次自由地聚集在一起，在他们自己的大洲上讨论每一个国家的每一个青年所关切的问题。
    苏加诺说，为甚么要举行这样的会议呢？我想，一个很重要的原因是我们亚洲和非洲的人彼此很不了解。这不完全是我们的过错，而只不过是一切政治局势中的最邪恶的东西——殖民主义——的又一个恶果。许多世代以来，有人一直在教我们向西方寻求启发和指导。我们一直由于在我们周围树立的障碍——实际的和精神的障碍——而同我们的患难兄弟隔绝开来。现在已经有机会恢复很久以前中断的接触了。现在已经有机会推倒这些人为的障碍，重新互相了解了。
    苏加诺说，虽然你们来自具有不同背景的地方，但是，这并不妨碍互相了解和合作。不要去寻找你们彼此之间的不同之点，而要寻求你们的共同之处，寻求你们对和平和幸福的事业所能作出的共同贡献。
    苏加诺说，仅仅是你们聚集在一堂、彼此交谈、互相了解和彼此更多地尊重一些，这些事情就会是很重要的。
    苏加诺说，我们的世界是一个充满着紧张局势的世界，其中大多数紧张局势都是由于殖民主义以及从误解而起的恐惧。如果战争竟然再次冲击这个充满着恐惧的世界，那末我们曾经努力争取的和我们所希望得到的一切都将毁灭。
    苏加诺问道，为什么人类不能从世界上根除这种殖民主义罪恶和这种战争灾难呢？
    苏加诺说，人类能够制造的东西，人类就能够消除掉！人类能够制造的东西，人类就能够控制住！我们能够制止殖民主义！我们能够制止战争！我们能够使战争发动不起来，我们能够在每一个地方建立自由。
    苏加诺说，达到这个目的所需要的一个根本要素就是合作，合作的一个根本要素就是互相了解。
    苏加诺说，如果千千万万的亚非知识青年互相了解，互相尊重，彼此合作，就能制止世界上许多罪恶行为。
    苏加诺最后祝贺会议将获得成功，并且希望这次会议将成为走向亚非两洲和全人类的安全和幸福的道路上的又一个里程碑。
    印度尼西亚总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约在会上讲了话。他要求参加会议的代表们尽力维护去年也在万隆举行的亚非会议所建立的“万隆精神”。
    他说，使亚非学生会聚一堂的是“对我们的命运的信心、对我们的发展和力量的信心、以及对真正的进步可以通过合作和互相了解再加上伟大的思想得到实现的信心”。他说，仍然有某些人喜欢看到学生代表们彼此争吵，但是他深信万隆会议的精神会胜利。他认为，亚非学生会议讨论的问题不应该是矛盾和意见分歧，而应该是实现共同理想和解决共同困难的方法。
    他预祝亚非学生会议成功。
    亚非学生会议印度尼西亚全国筹备委员会主席苏巴迪在会上致词说，我们在这里开会不是仅仅为了互相会面，而是为了造成新的气氛、造成互相了解和互相尊重的新态度，以便使亚非国家的学生之间能够实现有效和友好的合作。
    在这方面，我们将以去年四月的万隆总理会议的成就为指针，“万隆精神”也将作为我们亚非学生会议一切讨论的基础。
    他指出，“为我们各自的国家服务的意思是要寻求团结而不是争吵。因此不必在这个会议上宣传一个人的思想和一个国家的政治制度，虽然我们中间的确存在着不同的地方。我们不要寻求相异的地方，而是要寻求共同的地方。让我们只讨论真正的学生问题。的确，有待解决的学生问题仍然还是很多的”。
    苏巴迪对中国总理周恩来、印度总理尼赫鲁、埃及总理纳赛尔等亚非国家政府领袖的贺电表示感谢。
