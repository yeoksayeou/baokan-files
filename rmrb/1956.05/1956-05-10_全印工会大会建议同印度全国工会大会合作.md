　　全印工会大会建议同印度全国工会大会合作
    新华社新德里9日电  据印度报业托辣斯消息：由印度共产党领导的全印工会大会（前译全印总工会）建议同国大党领导的印度全国工会大会在争取和维护工人利益上进行合作。
    全印工会大会在给印度全国工会大会的信中说，虽然全印工会大会和印度全国工会大会之间可能存在着分歧，但是两个组织之间和所属的工会之间有可能进行合作，以便争取全国范围内能够维持生活的工资和较好的条件，停止裁减人员，防止失业，促进经济发展，加强亚洲团结和世界和平。
    信件说：在印度经济的目前情况下，所有工会之间的合作比以前任何时候都更加必不可少。
    全印工会大会建议采取积极步骤来争取组成一个统一的工人组织。它建议印度全国工会大会敦促政府举行一个由所有全国性的工会组织和独立的工会联合会的代表参加的圆桌会议，以拟订在一致同意的纲领和民主地进行工作的基础上实现团结的方法。
