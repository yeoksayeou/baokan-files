Comrades:

Entrusted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, I, on behalf of all members of the Communist Party of China and the entire Chinese people, extend the warmest brotherly congratulations to the Third Congress of the Albanian Labor Party and all its delegates.

The Albanian Labor Party, composed of outstanding sons and daughters of Albania and tempered in arduous battles, led the Albanian people in smashing the shackles of imperialism in the past, liberating the Albanian people, and is now leading the Albanian people to march confidently towards socialism.

The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people are very excited to learn that the People's Republic of Albania has successfully completed its first five-year plan, established a socialist industrial base, with the total value of industrial production in 1955 increasing by 179% compared to 1950, and grain production increasing by 53% compared to 1950. Along with the development of industry and agriculture, other sectors of the national economy have also seen great development. With the development of the national economy, the material and cultural life of the people has significantly improved. National income has now increased by nearly 70%. Recently, the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and the Council of Ministers implemented a decision to reduce prices, which further improved the material life of the people. Remarkable achievements have also been made in cultural education. As a result of actively pursuing a peaceful foreign policy, the international status of the People's Republic of Albania has also been continuously enhanced. All these achievements demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system and are the result of the enthusiastic labor of the Albanian people and the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha. These achievements not only lay a solid foundation for further improving the material and cultural living standards of the Albanian people and the cause of socialist construction but also strengthen the power of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

Based on the successful completion of the first five-year plan, the draft directives for the second five-year plan, formulated by the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and submitted to this congress for discussion and approval, present a magnificent socialist picture to the Albanian people.

The Communist Party of China and the entire Chinese people are delighted and encouraged by these great achievements made by the Albanian people.

I am very pleased to report to you, comrades, that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people are also advancing towards the great socialist goal. At present, the speed of socialist transformation in our country has greatly accelerated. The socialist transformation of handicrafts and private industry and commerce has achieved a decisive victory. At present, agriculture in our country has basically achieved semi-socialist cooperativization, and many provinces and counties have achieved full socialist cooperativization. The number of peasant households joining cooperatives accounts for 90% of the total number of peasant households, and members of advanced cooperatives account for 56% of the total number of members. The vast majority of cities across the country have implemented the joint state-private operation of all trades in private industry and commerce and the cooperativization of handicrafts. In about three more years, the socialist revolution in our country can be basically completed. On the basis of the development of the socialist transformation cause, industrial and agricultural production has also seen a new upsurge, which makes it possible for us to complete the first five-year plan ahead of schedule and ahead of target in a shorter period of time than expected. The reason why our country's socialist cause has been able to achieve such great and rapid development is inseparable from the comprehensive and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, and also inseparable from the active support of various people's democratic countries.

Dear comrades, although China and Albania are geographically far apart, the belief in Marxism-Leninism and common goals closely link us together. The brotherly friendship we have established in the past struggles has been further developed in recent years through increasingly frequent exchanges. In the future, we will unite even more closely in the socialist family, support each other, and learn from each other.

I am very honored to be able to participate in the Third Congress of the Albanian Labor Party and take this opportunity to convey the sincere friendship of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people to the glorious Albanian Labor Party and the heroic Albanian people, and wish the congress a complete success.

Long live the glorious Albanian Labor Party that guides the Albanian people from victory to victory!

Long live the unbreakable brotherly friendship and close cooperation between the people of China and Albania!

Long live the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live Marxism-Leninism!

### 中国共产党代表团团长曾山的祝词

    中国共产党代表团团长曾山的祝词
    亲爱的同志们：
    我受中国共产党中央委员会的委托，谨代表中国共产党的全体党员和全体中国人民向阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第三次代表大会和全体代表同志们致以最热烈的兄弟的祝贺。
    由阿尔巴尼亚优秀儿女组成的在艰苦的战斗中锻炼成长起来的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，在过去领导了阿尔巴尼亚人民粉碎了帝国主义的枷锁，使阿尔巴尼亚人民获得了解放，现在正领导着阿尔巴尼亚人民满怀信心地向着社会主义迈进。
    中国共产党和中国人民，非常兴奋地得悉阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国已胜利地完成了第一个五年计划，建立了社会主义工业基础，1955年工业生产总值比1950年增加了179％，粮食生产量比1950年增加了53％，与工、农业发展的同时，国民经济的其他各部门也都得到了很大的发展。随着国民经济的发展，人民的物质文化生活都有了显著的提高，现在国民收入增加了将近70％，最近阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央和部长会议又实施了减低物价的决定，这更进一步地改善了人民的物质生活。在文化教育方面也已取得了卓越的成就。由于积极地执行和平外交政策的结果，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的国际地位也日益提高。所有这一切的成就，都证明了社会主义制度的优越性；都是在阿尔巴尼亚人民热情的劳动和以恩·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央的正确领导下所取得的。这一切成就，不仅为进一步提高阿尔巴尼亚人民物质、文化生活水平和社会主义建设事业奠定了巩固的基础，同时也增强了以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营的力量。
    在胜利完成第一个五年计划的基础上，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会拟定的提交这次大会讨论通过的第二个五年计划指示草案，在阿尔巴尼亚人民面前展示出壮丽的社会主义图景。
    中国共产党和全体中国人民，为阿尔巴尼亚人民所获得的这些巨大成就，感到欢欣鼓舞。
    我很高兴地向同志们报告中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，也正向着伟大的社会主义目标前进，目前我国社会主义改造的速度已大大加快了，手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造已取得了具有决定意义的胜利。现在我国农业已基本上实现了半社会主义的合作化，其中有许多省、县已实现全社会主义的合作化，全国入社农户已占农户总数的90％，高级社社员占社员总数的56％。全国绝大多数城市已实行私营工商业的全行业公私合营和手工业合作化，大约再有三年，社会主义革命在我国就可以基本完成。在社会主义改造事业发展的基础上，工农业生产也出现了新的高涨，这就使我们有可能在比预定较短的时间内提前和超额完成第一个五年计划。我国社会主义事业所以能取得如此巨大和迅速的发展，是同苏联全面无私的援助分不开的，也是同各人民民主国家的积极支援分不开的。
    亲爱的同志们：中国和阿尔巴尼亚在地理上虽然相距很远，但马克思列宁主义的信仰和共同的目标，却把我们紧紧地连在一起，我们在过去的斗争中已建立起来的兄弟般的友谊，在近年来通过日益频繁的彼此往来又有了进一步的发展，今后我们将更加紧密地团结在社会主义的大家庭里，互相支持，互相学习。
    我对于这次能够参加阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第三次代表大会，感到非常荣幸，借此机会向光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，转达中国共产党和中国人民真挚的友谊，并祝大会圆满成功。
    引导阿尔巴尼亚人民从胜利走向胜利的光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党万岁！
    中阿两国人民牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊与亲密合作万岁！
    以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营万岁！
    马克思列宁主义万岁！
