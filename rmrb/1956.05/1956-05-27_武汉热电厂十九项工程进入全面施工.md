Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 26th - Nineteen projects at the Wuhan Thermal Power Plant are now under full-scale construction.

Since construction began on this large-scale thermal power plant last November, builders at the site have successively completed the central repair shop, material warehouse, production office building, and other projects. A dedicated railway line was also recently built to the heart of the construction site. Furnace builders spent just over two months building a chimney equivalent to thirty stories high.

At the technically complex main plant building site, builders are pouring concrete for the uppermost two layers at high altitudes.

Currently, concrete workers, rebar tiers, and carpenters have been divided into three shifts working day and night; approximately three hundred personnel responsible for installing machinery and equipment have also entered the site and begun preparatory work.

    武汉热电厂十九项工程进入全面施工
    新华社武汉26日电　武汉热电厂已经有十九项工程全面施工。
    这个规模很大的热电厂自从去年十一月开工兴建以后，工地建筑者们已经先后基本上建成了中央修配厂、材料库、生产办公楼等项工程。一条专用铁路线，不久以前也修筑到了工地的腹心。筑炉工人们只用两个多月的时间，筑起了相当于三十层楼高的烟囱。
    在技术复杂的主厂房工地上，建筑者们正在高空浇灌最上边的两层混凝土。
    现在混凝土工人、钢筋绑扎工人和木工们，已经分成日夜三班轮流施工；有三百名左右安装机器设备的人员也进入了工地，开始安装以前的准备工作。
