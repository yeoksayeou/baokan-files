Guarantee the "July 1st" Opening to Traffic to Yumen
Bridge-Building Workers Create New Record

The bridge-building workers on the Lanxin Railway created a new record on May 27th by erecting eight and a half spans of concrete bridges in one day.

In order to increase the speed of bridge construction, adapt to the needs of the track-laying team laying four kilometers of track day and night, and guarantee the "July 1st" opening to traffic to Yumen, the bridge-building workers proposed the initiative of erecting six spans of bridges per day. In the process of realizing this initiative, the bridge-building team rationally organized the labor force and improved work methods. When building the Hongshui River Bridge southwest of Jiuquan, they had already achieved the goal of erecting six spans of bridges per day. Now, in the process of building the Wenxinggou Bridge, they have created a new record of erecting eight and a half spans in one day.

Friendly Support from All Over

Many units across the country are actively supporting the construction of the Lanxin Railway in terms of labor allocation, material supply, and other aspects. More than 5,000 employees from Shanghai and other places have arrived at the railway construction site outside Jiayuguan one after another and invested in construction. Some employees have already put forward some rationalization proposals in the construction, which have improved construction efficiency. In terms of material supply, in addition to Anshan Iron and Steel Company vigorously manufacturing steel rails to ensure supply, a unit in Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province, also handed over some accumulated steel rails to the Shijiazhuang Railway Transportation Branch Bureau to be directly transported to the front-line construction site of the Lanxin Railway. The Fourth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways transferred a part of steel beams and bridge seats here, which solved the problem of the lack of bridge-building materials for the Beida River Bridge near Jiayuguan. Lanzhou State-owned Universal Machinery Factory also processed a large number of cross iron plates for signaling equipment for the Lanxin Railway to ensure the use for the opening to traffic to Yumen.

The Road-Building Team Advances on the Gobi Desert

On the Lanxin Railway construction site from Jiayuguan, the end of the Great Wall, to Yumen, tens of thousands of employees are working hard to build roadbeds and bridge and culvert projects.

This section of the Lanxin Railway is more than 60 kilometers long, winding through the boundless and uninhabited Gobi Desert, and the project is very arduous. This section has a total of sixteen large and small bridges and sixty culverts, and the roadbed project is 1.2 million cubic meters. The employees overcame the difficulties of complex geology, strong winds and sand, and water shortage, and made the project advance rapidly. According to statistics on May 26, most of the key bridge and culvert projects have been completed, and more than 75% of the roadbed earthwork and stonework projects have also been completed. This has opened up roads for the mechanical track-laying that is advancing day and night.

In the construction, the employees came up with various ways to improve work efficiency. Near Jiayuguan, there is a section of sand-夹石 roadbed that is very hard. The workers adopted the "loosening blasting" method, which increased work efficiency by more than two times. The employees of the Sixth Team of the Eighth Work Area, who came from Shanghai to support the construction of the Lanxin Railway, used the "double lifting and fierce lifting" method, which increased soil lifting efficiency by more than one time. They have won the Red Flag three times in a row. In the construction of bridges and culverts, small-scale mechanized construction such as hand-cart material transportation, small-cart weighing, crane hoisting of flagstone, and mobile pouring trucks for pouring concrete were generally adopted, which also greatly improved construction efficiency.

Nailing Factory Employees Speed Up Assembly

Wherever the track-laying progresses, we will supply the finished steel rails there. This is the determination of the employees of the Lanxin Railway Nailing Factory.

This factory is a recently established open-air factory on the edge of a desert northwest of Qingshuibao, Jiuquan. The workers use blowers, cranes, and other mechanical forces to assemble steel rails and sleepers into trapezoidal finished products, and then supply them to the front for mechanical track-laying. In order to supply the finished steel rails to the track-laying site in a timely manner, the workers actively tried to improve the assembly speed. Technician Xu Jizong proposed to add a sleeper spacer to make the sleepers distributed evenly and facilitate rail nailing, which resulted in saving manpower and increasing work efficiency by more than one time. Worker Qu Xinnian sharpened the drill bit during rest time, which increased the drilling speed and avoided the delay of the next process due to slow drilling. Since May 11, all shifts in the factory have broken the quota. The Youth Commando Team broke the quota by an average of 15.03% per day. Now, this factory can ship out four kilometers of finished steel rails every day to supply the needs of the front mechanical track-laying.

Fresh Fish and Shrimp Delivered to the Construction Site

Various daily necessities are continuously transported to the new railway construction site outside Jiayuguan. The Second Employee Life Supply Section of the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, which is responsible for supply work, not only fully supplies flour and miscellaneous grains, but also transfers more than 600,000 jin of rice from Zhangye, Linze, and other places to ensure the needs of the southern workers who come from Shanghai and other places. The supply of non-staple food can generally meet the needs, including sea cucumber, kelp, squid, salted fish, etc., which are transported from the coastal areas. The tens of thousands of jin of fresh fish and shrimp transported from Qingdao using refrigeration equipment in the past few months are most popular among the employees. The southern workers said after eating the fish: "I seem to be back in Shanghai again."

Now, six large trucks full of goods travel between the various work areas every day, delivering the goods to the supply stations. Then, each supply station sends salespersons to go deep into the construction site with the goods to supply the goods to the employees in a timely manner.

Preparing to Transport Crude Oil from Yumen Oilfield

After the comprehensive commencement of construction of the railway branch line connecting the Lanxin Railway trunk line to the Yumen Oilfield area, the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways is intensively carrying out preparations for the transportation of crude oil.

In order to ensure the safety of crude oil transportation, a double-layer fireproof layer is installed on the steam locomotive; the signal lights for night driving are changed from the original gasoline lamps to electromagnetic lamps, and employees are strictly prohibited from carrying fire. The service personnel on this branch line are also undergoing intensive training.

    保证“七一”通车到玉门
    架桥工人创造新纪录
    兰新铁路架桥工人在五月二十七日创造日架混凝土桥梁八空半的新纪录。
    为了提高架桥速度，适应钉道队日夜铺轨四公里的需要，保证“七一”通车到玉门，架桥工人们提出了日架六空桥的倡议。在实现这个倡议的过程中，架桥队合理地组织了劳动力，改进了工作方法。在架酒泉西南洪水河大桥的时候，已经作到日架六空桥。现在，在架文型沟大桥的过程中，他们又创造了日架八空半的最高纪录。
    各地的友谊支援
    全国各地许多单位在劳动力调配、材料供应等方面，积极支援兰新路建设。从上海等地来的五千多名职工，先后到达嘉峪关外的铁路工地，投入建设。有的职工已经在施工中提出一些合理化建议，提高了施工效率。在材料供应方面，除鞍山钢铁公司大力制造钢轨，保证供应以外，河北省石家庄某单位还将积存的一些钢轨，交由石家庄铁路运输分局直接运送到兰新铁路的前方工地。铁道部第四工程局将一部分钢梁、桥座调运到这里，解决了嘉峪关附近北大河大桥的架桥材料缺乏的问题。兰州国营通用机器厂也为兰新路加工了大批作信号设备用的交叉铁板，保证通车玉门使用。
    筑路队伍在戈壁滩上挺进
    从万里长城的终点嘉峪关到玉门的兰新铁路工地上，数万职工正在紧张地修建路基和桥涵工程。
    兰新路这一段全长六十多公里，蜿蜒在一望无际、荒无人烟的戈壁滩上，工程十分艰巨。这一段共有大小桥梁十六座、涵管六十个，路基工程有一百二十万方。职工们克服了地质复杂、风沙大和缺水等自然条件的困难，使工程迅速挺进。到五月二十六日统计，重点桥涵工程已经大部完工，路基土石方工程也有75％以上完工了。这就为星夜兼程前进的机械铺轨开辟了道路。
    在施工中，职工们想出种种办法提高工作效率。在嘉峪关附近，有一段沙夹石路基非常坚硬，工人们采用了“松动爆破”法，提高工作效率两倍多。由上海来支援兰新路建设的第八工区第六小队的职工，利用了“双抬猛提”的办法，使抬土效率提高一倍以上，他们连续获得了三次红旗。在修建桥涵的工程中，普遍采用了手车运料、小车过磅、吊车吊片石、流动灌注车浇灌混凝土等小型机械化施工，也大大提高了施工效率。
    钉道厂职工加快拼装速度
    前方铺轨到那里，我们把钢轨成品供应到那里。这是兰新铁路钉道厂职工们的决心。
    这个厂是最近在酒泉清水堡西北一片沙漠边缘上建立起的露天工厂。工人们利用鼓风机、吊车等机械力量，把钢轨和枕木拼装成梯形的成品，然后供应前方机械铺轨的需要。工人们为了及时把钢轨成品供应到铺轨的地方，积极设法提高了拼装速度，技术人员徐继宗，为了把枕木散布匀称，便于钉轨，提议添置一个枕木间隔板，结果节约了人力，提高工作效率一倍以上。工人屈新年利用休息时间磨尖钻头，提高了钻速，避免了因钻眼慢而造成下一道工序窝工。从五月十一日起，全厂各班都突破了定额。青年突击队班拼装一班每天平均突破定额15.03％。现在，这个厂每天能装运出四公里长的钢轨成品，供应前方机械铺轨的需要。
    工地上运来了鲜鱼海虾
    各种日用商品源源不断地运到嘉峪关外新建铁路工地。负责供应工作的铁道部第一工程局第二职工生活供应段，除充分供应面粉和杂粮外，还从张掖、临泽等地调运来六十多万斤大米，以保证由上海等地来的南方工人的需要。副食品的供应大体上可以满足需要，其中还有远从沿海一带调运来的海参、海带、鱿鱼、咸鱼等。这几个月由青岛利用冷藏设备运来的几万斤鲜鱼、鲜虾，最受职工们的欢迎。南方工人吃了鱼说：“我好像又回到了上海。”
    现在，每天都有六部满载商品的大卡车往来于各工区，把商品送到供应站里。然后，各供应站就派营业员携带商品，深入工地，把商品及时供应到职工手中。
    准备运出玉门油矿的原油
    玉门油矿区连接兰新路干线的铁路支线全面开工以后，铁道部第一工程局紧张地展开了运输原油的准备工作。
    为了保证原油运输的安全，在蒸汽机车上装置了双层防火层；晚间行车的信号灯由原来的汽油灯改为电磁灯，并且严禁职工携带火种。这条支线上的服务人员，也正在集中受训。
