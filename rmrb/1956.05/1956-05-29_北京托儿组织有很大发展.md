Beijing's childcare organizations had developed to more than 2,800 by May, with more than 55,000 children receiving good care and education in these organizations every day. The number of children enrolled has increased by more than 85% compared to last year.

The suburban childcare organizations have developed the fastest this year, with the number of childcare organizations and enrolled children increasing by eight and ten times respectively compared to last year. This year, all agricultural cooperatives have established kindergarten teams to accommodate children aged four to seven, which allows female members with many children to participate in production.

This year, a number of half-day or full-day street kindergarten classes have also been established in urban streets to provide pre-school children in the streets with all-round development education in terms of physical, intellectual, moral, and aesthetic aspects, while also solving the problem of childcare for street women, female members of handicraft production cooperatives, and working women when participating in work, production, and study.

    北京托儿组织有很大发展
    北京市托儿组织到五月份已发展到二千八百多处，每天有五万五千多个儿童在这些托儿组织里受到良好的照顾和教育。现在收托的儿童比去年增加了85％以上。
    郊区托儿组织今年发展的最快，托儿组织的数量和收托的儿童比去年分别增加了八倍和十倍以上。今年各农业合作社都建立了收托四岁到七岁儿童的幼儿队，这就使孩子多的女社员也能参加生产。
    今年城区街道上也建立了一批半日制或全日制的街道幼儿班，向街道上的学龄前儿童进行体、智、德、美全面发展的教育，同时也解决了街道妇女和手工业生产合作社女社员和职业妇女参加工作、生产、学习时孩子的拖累。
