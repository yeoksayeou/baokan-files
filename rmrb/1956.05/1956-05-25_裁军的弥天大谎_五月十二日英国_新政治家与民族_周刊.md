Another meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee ended in complete deadlock. But it is finally possible to clearly explain the problem. The big lie of disarmament has finally been exposed. The Russians put forward a reasonable and feasible plan for substantial reductions in conventional armaments, which the West flatly rejected. The Russians now intend to unilaterally reduce the level of their conventional armaments to extend their moral victory, which will undoubtedly make the West even more embarrassed. However, this is not the main point of contention. What matters is the real reason why the West rejected this proposal, because an analysis of these reasons will illustrate the bankruptcy of our overall international strategy.

Western spokesmen say that the proposal is unacceptable because it does not stipulate nuclear disarmament, nor does it stipulate an effective system of supervision, nor does it stipulate a prior political settlement, especially a political settlement in Germany. It should be pointed out that none of these criticisms are directed at the Russian proposal, which is not surprising, since most of the proposal simply repeats the Anglo-French proposal of March 1955. In fact, most of the Western accusations are irrelevant.

Neither the new Anglo-French proposal nor the new American proposal clearly explains how to establish an effective supervision system for the manufacture of nuclear weapons – indeed, both proposals explicitly acknowledge that, by definition, such a system cannot be established at present. Therefore, the Russians' claim is justified: the fact that a nuclear supervision method cannot be formulated for purely technical reasons should not prevent us from reaching a limited agreement on conventional weapons.

Western representatives insist that the nuclear supervision issue is a true test of Russia's intentions, thereby cleverly concealing the fact that the supervision clauses in the Russian proposal are fully sufficient to achieve their intended goals: verifying the implementation of conventional arms reductions. The "Open Skies" proposal is completely irrelevant; it is merely an attempt to create a vague psychological reconciliation. To the extent that aerial inspection is closely related to supervision (that is, through photography), this has already been stipulated in the Russian proposal.

…It is insincere to say that disarmament cannot be carried out before world tensions ease. If world tensions have eased, disarmament negotiations would be unnecessary. There is no inherent reason why a disarmament agreement should be linked to a political settlement – a political settlement actually meaning the reunification of Germany. First, such a settlement is outside the jurisdiction of the subcommittee. Furthermore, the West is now beginning to agree that German reunification is not achievable in the foreseeable future. Therefore, does the failure to reach an agreement on this issue necessarily mean that an agreement cannot be reached on the more fundamental issue of disarmament? No Western politician could agree with such a statement; however, this is essentially the logic of the Western opinion….

In the eyes of objective observers, the meeting left a deep impression that the Russians were entirely focused on the specific issue of disarmament, while the West sought to obtain something very different: a global package deal. This contradiction in purpose emphasizes our real weakness. …Large-scale reductions in conventional armaments are not only possible for Russia, but also appropriate. It does not cause industrial problems. On the contrary… disarmament would pose real economic problems for Western governments, at least in the short term.

…The obvious fact is that if the West accepts the level proposed by Russia, it would need to abandon the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Middle East Treaty Organization, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, abandon many American bases around the world, and greatly reduce Western commitments in Korea, Indochina, and Japan. … plunging the West's global strategy into an inextricable state of chaos.

    裁军的弥天大谎
    五月十二日英国“新政治家与民族”周刊
    联合国裁军委员会小组委员会的又一次会议以完全的僵局而结束。但是终于能够非常清楚地说明这个问题了。裁军的弥天大谎最后被揭穿，俄国人提出了一个大量裁减常规军备的合理和可行的计划，西方断然拒绝了这个建议。俄国人现在打算单方面裁减他们的常规军备的水平来扩大他们的道义胜利，毫无疑问，这将使西方更加难堪。然而这不是主要的争点。要紧的是西方所以拒绝这个建议的真正原因，因为对这些原因的分析将说明我们的全盘国际策略的破产。
    西方发言人们说这个建议不能接受，因为建议里面没有规定核子裁军，也没有规定有效的监督制度，也没有规定事先的政治解决，尤其是在德国的政治解决。应该指出，这些批评中没有一个是针对俄国的建议的，这并没有什么可奇怪的地方，因为这个建议的大部分只是重复1955年3月的英法建议。事实上，西方的指责大部分是不相干的。
    新的英法建议或新的美国建议都没有清楚说明怎样才能为核子武器的制造制订出有效的监督制度——的确，两个建议都明确承认，从定义上说，这样一种制度在现在是不可能制订的。因此，俄国人提出的这种说法是正当的：由于纯技术原因而不能制订出核子监督办法这一事实不应该阻挠我们就常规武器达成一项有限度的协议。
    西方代表们坚持说，核子监督问题是对俄国的意图的一个真正考验，他们这样就巧妙地掩蔽了这一事实：俄国人建议中的监督条款是完全足以达到它们要达到的目标的：查核裁减常规武器的实施情况。“开放天空”建议是完全不相干的；它仅仅在试图引起一种模糊的心理上的和解。就空中视察同监督有密切关系（这就是通过照像）来说，在俄国的建议中已对这一点作出规定了。
    ……若说在世界紧张局势和缓以前不能进行裁军，这是没有诚意的。如果世界紧张局势已经缓和了，裁军谈判也就不必要了。为什么裁军协议应该和政治解决联系起来，这是没有先天的理由的——政治解决实际上就是重新统一德国的意思。首先，这样一种解决是在小组委员会的职权范围以外的。此外，西方现在正开始同意德国重新统一在可以预见的将来是不能实现的。因此，未能在这个问题上取得协议就一定自然地使得不能就更为基本的裁军问题达成协议吗？任何西方政治家都不可能同意这样一个说法；可是，基本上这是西方意见的逻辑……。
    在客观的观察家看来，这个会议留下了一个深刻的印象，就是俄国人全部集中于裁军这个具体问题上，而西方则设法获得很不同的东西：全球性的一揽子交易。这种目的上的矛盾着重地说明了我们的真正弱点。……大规模地裁减常规军备对俄国来说，不但是可能的，而且是相宜的。它并不引起工业上的问题。相反地……裁军至少在短期间内会使西方政府面临真正的经济问题。
    ……明显的事实是，如果西方接受俄国提出的水平，那就需要放弃北大西洋公约组织、中东条约组织和东南亚条约组织，放弃美国在世界各地的许多基地，大大地减少西方在朝鲜、印度支那和日本所承担的义务。……使西方的全球战略陷于不能自拔的混乱状态。
