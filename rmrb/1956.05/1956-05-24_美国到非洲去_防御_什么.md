	What is the US Going to Africa to "Defend"?
	U.S. Assistant Secretary of State George Allen is making a three-week trip to Africa starting May 12. According to Agence France-Presse, he is going to Africa to "study the issue of unified defense in the part of Africa south of the Sahara Desert."

	In faraway Africa, what is there that needs to be "defended" by the United States?

	In some of his recent speeches on U.S. foreign policy toward Africa, Allen admitted that the anti-colonial struggle of the African people is a powerful force, forming a "boiling and powerful progression," and posing a "real challenge" to U.S. diplomacy. He believes that in order to meet this "challenge," "sound judgment and leadership" are needed. Allen's proposition is: "To use our (the United States') influence to make the transformation of Africa an orderly evolutionary process."

	Given that colonialists are being driven out of their positions in Asia and Africa one after another, Allen knows in his heart that time is running out. The African continent south of the Sahara Desert is the last line of defense for colonialists, and something must be done to soften the anti-colonial struggle of the people there. He said that the "concept of international relations in the past was different from what it is now," and a change is inevitable, but a smokescreen can be used to cover the African people with a flowered blanket, so that those who used to ride on them can continue to do so in the future. According to Allen, changes beyond this scope will "seriously weaken" the "free world." Therefore, he only allows "orderly evolution."

	In this "evolutionary" process, the United States will certainly not stand idly by. According to Allen, because the United States is equally "concerned" about both its "European allies" who are colonialists and its "African friends" who demand independence, and because the United States just happens to have a so-called "tradition" of anti-colonialism that is supposedly "well known," the "evolutionary" process in Africa should be "led" by the United States. In this way, the African people and the "European allies" have an uninvited "guardian."

	The so-called "sound" leadership that the U.S. "guardian" wants to achieve in Africa is not just to soften the anti-colonial struggle of the African people. Since the nineteenth century, the Morgan, Rockefeller, and other financial giants in the United States have been expanding their influence in Africa year by year. And now, while Allen is talking about a "high sense of responsibility" to Africa, he also says with undisguised greed: "This region is rich in important materials such as uranium, diamonds, rubber, and industrial metals." Allen also said: The United States needs an Africa that feels "free and friendly" to American capital.

	It is clear that what the United States wants to "defend" in Africa is the struggle of the African people for independence. What the United States wants to protect is its hegemony in the struggle with other colonial countries for African colonies, and its colonial interests in Africa. However, Allen wants to hide all this and say that what the United States wants to "defend" is the so-called "communist infiltration." But this cliché to cover up American aggression can no longer deceive people. The Indonesian "People's Thoughts Daily" put it well: "The United States shouts loudly: Oppose communism! But in its heart, it is saying, for me, and only for me."

### 美国到非洲去“防御”什么

    美国到非洲去“防御”什么
    美国助理国务卿乔治·艾伦从五月十二日起在非洲作一次历时三星期的旅行。据法新社报道：他去非洲是为了要“研究撒哈拉大沙漠以南的非洲部分的统一防御问题。”
    在遥远的非洲，有些什么需要美国去“防御”的呢？
    在他不久以前发表的一些关于美国对非洲的外交政策的演说里，艾伦承认，非洲人民反殖民主义斗争声势浩大，已经形成“沸腾的和有力的进展”，并且对美国外交提出了“真正的挑战”。他认为，为了应付这个“挑战”，需要“高明判断和领导”。艾伦的主张是：“使用我们（美国）的影响使得非洲的转变成为一种有秩序的演进过程”。
    鉴于殖民主义者正从亚洲和非洲的阵地上一个接一个地被赶走，艾伦心里明白：时间不多了，撒哈拉沙漠以南的非洲大陆是殖民主义者的最后防线，必须做些事情来软化那里人民的反殖民主义斗争。他说，当年的“国际关系的概念是与现在不同的”，变化一下是不可避免的了，但是可以来一个障眼法，给非洲人民蒙上一块花毯子，以便原先骑在他们身上的人今后可以照样骑着。超过这个范围的变化，据艾伦说，是会“严重削弱”“自由世界”的。因此他只允许“有秩序的演进”。
    在这个“演进”过程中，美国当然决不袖手旁观。据艾伦说，由于美国对殖民主义的“欧洲盟国”和要求独立的“非洲朋友”同样“关切”，而且美国刚好有着据说是“众所周知”的所谓反殖民主义的“传统”，因此，非洲的“演进”过程应该由美国来“领导”。这样，非洲人民和“欧洲盟国”就有了一个不请自来的“监护人”。
    美国“监护人”想在非洲实现的所谓“高明的”领导，还不仅仅是要软化非洲人民的反殖民主义斗争。从十九世纪起，美国的摩根、洛克菲勒家族和其他金融巨头就在非洲逐年扩大他们的影响。而现在，艾伦在侈谈什么对非洲的“高度责任感”的时候，又馋涎欲滴地说：“这个地区盛产铀、钻石、橡胶和工业用金属之类的重要物资。”艾伦还说过：美国需要一个使美国资本感到“自由和友好”的非洲。
    事情很清楚，美国在非洲所要“防御”的是非洲人民争取独立的斗争。美国所要保护的是美国在同其他殖民国家争夺非洲殖民地中的霸权，是美国在非洲的殖民利益。然而艾伦却想把这一切掩藏起来，而把美国所要“防御”的东西说成是所谓“共产党渗入”。可是这个掩盖美国侵略的口头禅现在也骗不了人了。印度尼西亚的“人民思潮报”说得好：“美国大声喊着：反对共产主义啊！但是它内心里却是说，为了我，而且只是为了我。”
