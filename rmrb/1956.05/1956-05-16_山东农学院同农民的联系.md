Shandong Agricultural College's Connection with Farmers
Zhang Baoyi

In recent years, under the guidance of the spirit of combining theory with practice, Shandong Agricultural College has achieved remarkable results in learning and summarizing the farming experiences of the peasant masses.

One method by which the Agricultural College connects with reality is to systematically send teachers to reside in agricultural production cooperatives. They live with the members of the cooperative, explaining agricultural science principles to them, so that the members understand how crops can grow well, how to control pests and diseases, how to prevent and treat livestock diseases, and so on. At the same time, the Agricultural College selects and incorporates the various farming experiences of the farmers into the teaching materials, enriching the teaching content.

Shahe Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in Licheng County is a base for the Agricultural College to connect with practice. The farmers of Shahe Township like to grow rice, but the rice is planted very sparsely, and the yield is very low, with the highest yield being only around 400 jin per mu. Some people once suspected that the reason for the low rice yield was the failure to implement close planting, but the local farmers said: Rice can be closely planted in the south, but it may not be possible in the north, because the soil quality in the north is not as good as in the south. Close planting of rice in the north is prone to lodging, and if it lodges, it will not produce grains. Wei Hongde, a lecturer at the Agricultural College, and the comrades of the plant cultivation teaching and research group of the Agricultural College studied this issue and analyzed the soil quality, cultivation foundation, and climatic conditions here, and believed that close planting was possible. However, this required changing the old planting method of the past and implementing strong seedling cultivation methods. Therefore, the members of Shahe Township followed the methods told to them by the Agricultural College and carried out close planting. The row spacing and hill spacing of rice were changed from one foot to seven inches, and more than 11,000 hills were planted per mu. As a result, the average yield per mu reached 579 jin. The success of close planting of rice not only made the farmers more confident in science but also enriched the teaching content of rice cultivation at the Agricultural College. In addition, the Agricultural College also directly imparted some scientific knowledge and provided guidance on some farming techniques to the Shahe Township Agricultural Production Cooperative.

Usually, many professors, lecturers, and students from the Agricultural College go to the Shahe Township Agricultural Production Cooperative to observe the growth of various crops, visit farmers, and participate in actual farming. At the same time, they often invite cooperative directors, labor models, and farmers to the Agricultural College to visit and hold discussions, allowing farmers to raise issues that need to be resolved in agricultural production. Once, Ma Maolin, the vice-chairman of the Shahe Township Cooperative, came to the Agricultural College for a visit and asked them: The wheat looks ripe, but when you peel it open, there are no grains; the corn cobs only have grains in the middle, and the ends are empty. What is this disease? The Agricultural College conducted research. According to their research, the reason why the ends of the corn cobs do not produce grains is not only due to poor pollination but also because of insufficient nutrients and moisture when the corn is flowering; the reason why wheat does not produce grains is not only because of drought and insect pests but also because of diseases. This enriched the teaching and research work of the Agricultural College.

Another method by which Shandong Agricultural College connects with practice is to systematically conduct surveys among farmers. When Professor Li Jiawen of the Vegetable Cultivation Department led lecturers and interns of the teaching and research group to Beiyuan in the suburbs of Jinan City to investigate the vegetable cultivation methods of farmers, they found that lettuce grew very well, with particularly thick stems. Why were they able to cultivate such thick lettuce stems so well? How did they prevent the phenomenon of lettuce stems only developing slenderly (called "bolting" by farmers)? Professor Li Jiawen conducted a survey of the farmers. An old vegetable farmer named Zhang Qin said: "Bolting occurs when it is dry, bolting occurs when it is waterlogged, and bolting also occurs when it is lean (lack of fertilization)." This brief answer greatly inspired Professor Li Jiawen, who had studied vegetable cultivation for nearly twenty years, and aroused his interest in learning from farmers even more.

When Professor Li Jiawen was conducting a survey in Beiyuan in the suburbs of Jinan City, he also saw farmers putting up kidney bean racks and intercropping them with celery. Based on the lessons learned from his own failed trial of close planting of tomatoes in the past, he analyzed the growth characteristics of celery, which prefers moisture and fears heat, and kidney beans, which prefer sunshine and are not afraid of heat. He also conducted research based on the Soviet Union's shelter planting method and the principle of interspecies mutual assistance, proving that the farmer's intercropping of kidney beans and celery was scientifically sound. Therefore, he further experimented with intercropping tomatoes and cabbage in alternating rows, resulting in a yield of more than 8,800 jin of tomatoes per mu (more than twice that of local farmers) and more than 3,000 jin of cabbage. Later, he also implemented methods such as applying fertilizer in stages, foliar fertilization, and retaining more fruit ears, so that the actual yield of tomatoes per mu reached more than 25,000 jin, the high-yield field reached more than 28,000 jin, and the actual yield of cabbage per mu was more than 6,000 jin.

Shandong Agricultural College has learned a lot of rich farming experience from farmers, which has enriched the teaching content. During the survey in Beiyuan in the suburbs of Jinan City alone, they learned 74 experiences from farmers that could not be found in books, and they have already made scientific analyses and summaries of these experiences. In the past three years, Professor Li Jiawen has compiled more than 1.4 million words of investigation materials.

    山东农学院同农民的联系
    张保义
    山东农学院几年来，在理论和实际相结合的精神指导下，在学习和总结农民群众的农作经验方面，取得了显著的成绩。
    农学院联系实际的一个方法，是有计划地派教师驻在农业生产合作社里。他们和社员生活在一起，向社员们讲解农业科学的道理，使社员懂得了庄稼怎样才能长好，有了虫害怎样除治，家畜应该如何防疫等等。同时，农学院把农民的各种农作的经验，经过选择，吸收到教材里面，使教学内容丰富起来。
    历城县沙河乡农业生产合作社是农学院联系实际的一个据点。沙河乡的农民喜欢种水稻，但是水稻种得很稀，产量很低，每亩最高的产量只有四百斤上下。曾经有人怀疑水稻产量不高的原因是没有实行密植，但是当地的农民说：水稻在南方能密植，在北方就不一定能密植，因为北方没有南方的土质好。北方水稻密植，容易倒伏，倒伏下去，就不结粒。农学院的讲师魏鸿德和农学院植物栽培系教研组的同志一起研究了这个问题，对这里的土质、耕作基础以及气候条件等作了分析，认为可以密植。但这须要改变过去的旧种法，要实行培育壮苗栽培法等。于是，沙河乡的社员 们按照农学院告诉他们的办法，进行了密植。水稻的行距、墩距由过去的一尺改为七寸，每亩种到一万一千多墩。结果每亩平均产量达到了579斤。水稻密植的成功，不仅使农民更相信了科学，也使农学院的水稻栽培教学内容丰富起来。此外，农学院还对沙河乡农业生产合作社直接传授了一些科学知识和作了一些耕作技术的指导工作。
    农学院平时有许多教授、讲师和学生到沙河乡农业生产合作社里去观察各种作物生长的情况，访问农民，实际参加耕作。同时还常常邀请合作社社长、劳动模范和农民到农学院来参观、座谈，让农民提出农业生产上所需要解决的问题。有一次，沙河乡合作社副社长马茂林来农学院参观，就问他们：小麦看着是熟了，剥开却没有粒；玉米棒子只中间有粒，两头是空的，这是什么病？农学院就进行了研究。根据他们的研究，玉米棒两头不结粒，不单单是受粉不好，还由于玉米开花的时候养料和水分不足；小麦不结粒不仅因为旱、虫灾害，而且还因为病害。这就使农学院的教学和研究工作丰富起来。
    山东农学院联系实际的另一种方法，是有计划地到农民中去作调查。蔬菜栽培系李家文教授，领着教研组的讲师和实习生，到济南市郊北园调查农民的蔬菜栽培方法的时候，发现莴苣长得很好，茎特别肥大。为什么他们能把很不容易长得肥大的莴苣茎培植得这么好呢？他们怎样防止了莴苣茎只向细长发展（农民叫“窜”）的现象呢？李家文教授向农民作了调查。一位叫张勤的老菜农说：“旱了窜，涝了窜，瘦了（施肥少）也窜。”这个简短的答案，使研究了近二十年蔬菜栽培的李家文教授得到了极大的启发，从此更引起了他向农民学习的兴趣。
    李家文教授在济南市郊北园作调查的时候，还看到农民把芸豆架起来同芹菜间作。根据以前他自己试种密植蕃茄失败的教训，分析了芹菜喜湿怕热、芸豆喜阳不怕热等长成期的特性，又根据苏联的屏障栽植法、种间互助的原理进行了研究，证明农民把芸豆和芹菜间作是合乎科学道理的。于是他就进一步试验了蕃茄和甘蓝隔畦间作的办法，结果每亩产蕃茄八千八百多斤（高于当地农民的一倍多），还产甘蓝三千多斤。后来，他又实行了分期施肥、根外追肥和多留果穗等办法，使每亩蕃茄的实际产量达到二万五千多斤，丰产田达到二万八千多斤，甘蓝每亩的实际产量是六千多斤。
    山东农学院从农民那里学习了很多丰富的农作经验，丰富了教学内容。仅仅在济南市郊北园调查的时候，他们就从农民中学到了七十四项书本上找不到的经验，他们已经对这些经验作了科学的分析和总结。三年来李家文教授编写了一百四十多万字的调查材料。
