Welcome the Results of the South France Talks

　　As the international situation further tends towards détente, mutual visits and direct contacts between leaders of different countries are increasing. Such visits are demonstrating an increasingly important role in increasing the atmosphere of international trust and promoting the resolution of major international issues through consultation. At this time, Yugoslav President Tito visited France from May 7 to 12 and held talks with French President Coty and Prime Minister Mollet. There is no doubt that the South France talks are of great significance in promoting international cooperation and safeguarding world peace.
　　Yugoslavia and France have a long-standing traditional friendly relationship in history. During the Anti-Fascist War, the people of the two countries supported each other and fought shoulder to shoulder in order to resist the common enemy and strive for national independence and freedom. After the war, although the development paths of the two countries were different, it did not block the road of friendship between the peace-loving and freedom-loving people of the two countries. In the joint communique after the talks between the two sides, it was decided to strengthen the traditional ties between the two countries, further promote cooperation in the political, economic and cultural fields, and decide to study ways for the two countries to cooperate in the peaceful use of atomic energy. Undoubtedly, the realization of these decisions will promote new development of friendly relations between the two countries. This is not only beneficial to the common welfare of the people of the two countries and conforms to the wishes of the people of the two countries, but also conforms to the interests of stabilizing the European situation and safeguarding world peace.
　　The leaders of Yugoslavia and France exchanged views on major international issues in a spirit of mutual understanding and friendly consultation, and reached unanimous views on several issues. In the joint communique, the two sides stated the desire of the two governments to continue to work to ensure lasting peace and promote cooperation between all countries. The two countries expressed their willingness to abide by the principles of the United Nations Charter, consolidate the United Nations organization, and give full play to the role of this global organization. The two governments expressed their acceptance of the principle of coexistence of countries with different social systems, pointing out that this is the only way to consolidate lasting peace. Regarding the issue of disarmament, which is of universal concern, the two governments expressed their willingness to work to promote agreements on issues such as arms limitation and supervision. In addition, the two governments expressed a common positive attitude towards strengthening international economic cooperation. It is known that Yugoslavia and France are two countries with different social systems but with important positions in Europe and the world. The unanimous views they expressed in the joint communique on several issues will inevitably play a positive role in ensuring European security, promoting the resolution of outstanding international issues, and broadly developing international cooperation, thereby helping to promote the development of the international situation in the direction expected by the people of the world. The results of the two countries' talks reflected in the joint communique once again prove that direct contact between leaders of countries with different systems is an effective way to fully find common ground, increase international trust and resolve international issues through consultation. As the Yugoslav "Combat News" said: Although some differences arose in the talks due to the different systems and circumstances of the two countries, what is important is that these differences do not prevent the leaders of the two countries from reaching agreements on certain issues.
　　People are satisfied to see the policy of peace and international cooperation pursued by the Yugoslav government. Since the second half of last year, President Tito has successively visited India, Burma, Egypt, and Ethiopia, and has made many efforts to promote international friendly cooperation, which shows that Yugoslavia is playing an increasingly important role in international affairs. We sincerely wish the Yugoslav government and people to make new contributions to safeguarding world peace and promoting international cooperation.

    欢迎南法会谈的成果
    随着国际局势进一步趋向和缓，不同国家的领导人员的相互访问和直接接触日益增多。这种访问在增加国际间的信任气氛和推动用协商方法解决国际间重大问题上，显示了日益重要的作用。在这个时候，南斯拉夫总统铁托从五月七日到十二日在法国进行访问，并和法国总统戈蒂和总理摩勒举行了会谈。毫无疑问，南法会谈在促进国际合作和保障世界和平的事业上是有着重要意义的。
    南斯拉夫和法国之间，在历史上有着长时期的传统的友好关系。在反法西斯战争期间，两国人民为了反抗共同的敌人，争取国家的独立自由，曾互相支持并进行了肩并肩的斗争。战后，两国的发展道路虽然不同，但并没有堵塞爱好和平和自由的两国人民之间的友谊道路。这次双方会谈后的联合公报中，决定加强两国的传统联系，进一步推动政治、经济和文化方面的合作，并决定研究两国在和平利用原子能方面进行合作的方法。无疑地，这些决定的实现，将促进两国友好关系的新的发展。这不仅有利于两国人民的共同福利，符合两国人民的愿望，而且也符合于安定欧洲局势和维护世界和平的利益。
    南、法两国领导人员在会谈中以相互谅解和友好协商的精神，就目前国际上重大问题交换了意见，并在若干问题上取得了一致的见解。在联合公报中，双方表明了两国政府将继续努力来保障持久和平和促进一切国家之间的合作的愿望。两国表示愿意遵守联合国宪章的原则，巩固联合国组织，以充分发挥这个世界性组织的作用。两国政府表示接受不同社会制度国家共处的原则，指出只有这样才能使持久和平得到巩固。对于世人一致关切的裁军问题，两国政府表示要努力促进军备的限制和监督等问题达成协议。此外，对于加强国际经济合作，两国政府表示了共同的积极态度。大家知道，南斯拉夫和法国是两个社会制度不同但在欧洲和世界有着重要地位的国家。他们在联合公报中对若干问题所表示的一致的见解，必将对保障欧洲的安全，推动国际间悬而未决的问题的解决，广泛地发展国际合作发生积极的作用，从而有利于促使国际局势向着世界人民期望的方向发展。联合公报所表现的两国会谈的成果，再一次证明了：不同制度国家领导人员之间的直接接触，是充分寻找共同接触点、增加国际信任和协商解决国际问题的有效途径。正如南斯拉夫“战斗报”所说的：在会谈中虽然出现了若干因两个国家制度和情况不同而引起的分歧，但，重要的是，这些分歧并不阻碍两国领导人员在某些问题上达成协议。
    人们满意地看到南斯拉夫政府奉行的和平和国际合作的外交政策。从去年下半年起，铁托总统先后访问了印度、缅甸、埃及、埃塞俄比亚，为促进国际友好合作作了许多努力，这显示着南斯拉夫在国际事务上起着日益重要的作用。我们热诚地预祝南斯拉夫政府和人民在保障世界和平和促进国际合作上作出新的贡献。
