　　To Meet the Needs of the Broad Masses of Farmers
    Tianjin Cotton Mill Increases Coarse Yarn Production Threefold
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 26th] The Tianjin State-owned Cotton Textile Mill has completed its task of increasing coarse yarn production ahead of schedule, which fully guarantees the growing needs of the broad masses of farmers after the bumper harvest. The original plan of each factory was to increase the production of 20-count yarn threefold within one month starting from the 23rd of last month. Thanks to the efforts of all the workers, it was completed ahead of schedule by the 20th of this month, exceeding the quota by 8.28 percent. While state-owned factories increased production, private factories in Tianjin such as Hengyuan, Beiyang, and Dasheng also actively responded to the government's call and greatly increased the production of coarse yarn. As of the 20th of this month, Hengyuan and Beiyang factories had also completed their plans to increase production threefold.

    津棉纺厂增产粗纱三倍
    【新华社天津二十六日电】天津国营棉纺织厂增产粗纱的任务已提前完成，这就充分保证了丰收后广大农民日益增涨的需要。各厂原计划自上月二十三日开始于一个月内将二十支纱增产三倍，由于全体职工的努力，迄本月二十日即提前完成，并超额百分之八点二八。与国营厂进行增产的同时，天津恒源、北洋、达生等私营厂也积极响应政府号召，大量增产粗纱，至本月二十日止，恒源、北洋两厂也已完成增产三倍的计划。
