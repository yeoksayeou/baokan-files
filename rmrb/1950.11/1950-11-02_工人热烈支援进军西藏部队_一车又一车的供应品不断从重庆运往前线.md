Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, November 1st. Workers in several public and private factories in Chongqing are enthusiastically contributing their greatest efforts to rush-produce supplies for the People's Liberation Army troops advancing into Tibet. After receiving an order for a large quantity of dry rations, the workers of the Chongqing Grain and Forage Factory, through five days and nights of diligent work, restarted the dry bread manufacturing machine, the motorized mixing machine, the crimping machine, and the four large and small ovens that had been idle for five years and were collapsing, increasing bread production by more than threefold. The workers were extremely concerned about the health of the soldiers and did everything possible to make the bread "small in volume, durable for storage, rich in nutrients, and easy to carry." They also added many nourishing ingredients, such as eggs, white sugar, soybeans, salt, and orange juice, to the dry rations, so that the soldiers could maintain the energy to travel long distances and bravely annihilate the enemy. To further increase production, technicians spent ten days painstakingly researching and experimenting, transforming the original vegetable dehydration factory into a bread factory, making full use of all the factory's equipment. The workers put forward the slogan "People rest, machines don't rest" to rush production. A certain woolen mill that accepted the support task increased its output by two to three times compared to usual. A worker named Yang Shuqing once produced 22.9 meters of woolen cloth in a day, while before liberation, the highest daily output per person was only eight meters. Some workers in the arsenal voluntarily increased their working hours to around 10 PM, averaging more than fifteen hours of work per day, and were unwilling to rest even on Sundays. After the private Zhongyi Military Uniform Factory accepted an order for gloves, the workers produced them day and night, increasing production by nearly double.

Chairman Liu Bocheng of the Southwest Military and Political Committee and other leaders of the military region frequently instructed that the dry rations should be made more nutritious and personally inspected various preparations, showing meticulous care for the troops entering Tibet, which further encouraged the workers' production enthusiasm. Before the departure of the advancing troops, countless trucks loaded with olive-green raincoats, oilcloth, yellow woolen gloves, leather shoes, cloth shoes, rubber shoes, military uniforms, military caps, shirts, various dry rations, mess kits, thermos bottles, marching tents, and horse headgear for protecting livestock were continuously transported from Chongqing to the front lines.

　　工人热烈支援进军西藏部队
    一车又一车的供应品不断从重庆运往前线
    【新华社重庆一日电】重庆市若干公营和私营工厂的工人们，在为人民解放军进军西藏的部队赶制供应品时，热烈地贡献出了自己的最大力量。重庆粮秣厂在接到订制大批的干粮任务后，工友们经过五天日日夜夜的勤劳操作，把已停工五年的干面包制造机、机动调拌机、扎片机和倾塌了的四个大小烘炉都开动起来，使面包的产量提高了三倍多。工友们异常关怀部队弟兄的健康，他们想尽一切办法使面包作到“体积小、耐久藏、营养成份丰富、便于携带”，还用许多滋养品、如鸡蛋、白糖、黄豆、盐、橘子汁等加在干粮内，以便使战士弟兄们能够维持长途跋涉、猛勇歼敌的充沛精力。为了更进一步提高产量，技工们经过十天苦心研究和实验，使原来的蔬菜脱水工厂改造成为面包工厂，充分利用了全厂的所有设备。工友们提出“人休息，机器不休息”的口号赶制。接受了支援任务的某制呢厂产量较往常增加二、三倍。该厂工友杨树清一天曾制呢达二十二点九公尺，而解放前每人日织最高额只能达到八公尺。兵工厂的有些工友们自动增加工时至晚上十时左右，平均每人每日工作十五小时以上，在礼拜天也不愿休息。私营中益军服厂接受了手套订货后，工友们日夜生产，产量增加几及一倍。
    西南军政委员会刘伯承主席及军区诸首长经常指示要把干粮做得更富营养些，并亲自检查各项准备工作，对入藏部队关心体贴备至，因而更鼓舞了工人的生产热潮。在进军部队出发前，数不清的一车又一车的油绿色雨衣、油布、黄呢手套、皮鞋、布鞋、胶鞋、军服、军帽、衬衣、各种干粮、行军锅、温水瓶、行军帐幕及保护牲口用的马头套等供应品，陆续不断地从重庆运到了前线。
