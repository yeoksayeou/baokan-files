　　American Progressive People Fight for Peace
    Ozerov, Soviet Union
    On the eve of the Second World Congress for World Peace, the struggle for peace in the United States is becoming increasingly powerful. Even in this stronghold of international imperialism, more and more people are condemning aggression and the arms race. By the end of September, 2.5 million people had signed the Stockholm Appeal for Peace—and this was accomplished under the threat that every supporter of the appeal was almost accused of treason.

    An event in Brooklyn illustrates some of the circumstances in which American peace advocates conduct their struggle. On Memorial Day—commemorating those who sacrificed their lives in the wars fought in the United States—the fascist organization American Legion held an aggression-advocating parade in a certain park in Brooklyn. Shortly before this group of fascist thugs began to depart, an old, broken-down car drove up to the park entrance. Four young men and one young woman jumped out of the car: furniture worker Arthur Idellman, sailor Louis Mazkani, cardboard factory worker Herbert Silnick, and George and Dezman, both school teachers. They were carrying buckets of whitewash and brushes. A few minutes later, the American Legion contingent and the audience gathered there saw slogans written in three-foot-high letters on the sidewalk and memorial archway: "Peace," "Ban the Atomic Bomb," and "Ban the Hydrogen Bomb." But just then, those who had issued these stirring calls for peace were thrown into jail. They were arrested at the park entrance and charged with "malicious mischief" and "conspiracy." Arthur Idellman, a Navy veteran who had fought in the Pacific during World War II, said during police interrogation, "I decided to start a peace movement after seeing my friends die." As a result, Idellman was sentenced to one year in prison, and his friends to six months.

    Such things are commonplace in the United States today.

    In Philadelphia, fifteen people were arrested for distributing the Stockholm Peace Appeal. The judge presiding over the case said that these people were guilty of "near treason" and considered the leaflets containing the full text of the Stockholm Peace Appeal and the petition for peace to be material evidence of this "treasonous crime." This judicial tyranny provoked a tide of protest.

    However, no threat of reprisal can destroy the will of peace fighters. Here is a typical example. General Eisenhower, in his capacity as President of Columbia University, forbade students from distributing the Stockholm Peace Appeal on campus. So the students moved their activities to the Teachers College at the corner of 120th Street and Broadway, and collected 650 signatures in two hours.

    A young black girl in New York named Gloria Graves collected hundreds of signatures, which she collected from workers in the Columbus area during her lunch break and from workers in Harlem, where she lived, after work. Miss Graves said that almost everyone she approached signed. Only a very few were afraid to sign, saying that signing such a petition now was "a very dangerous thing."

    She found that young people responded readily to her appeal, many of whom said to her, "I participated in World War II, and I don't want to participate in another war."

    In Hackensack, near New York, Labor Peace Conference personnel collected 200 signatures in one hour. In one home, they met a middle-aged woman—the mother of four children, all of whom survived World War II, but many of her neighbors were killed. This American woman said as she signed, "I want peace." She also asked for several petitions, promising to persuade her friends to sign. She also said, "I believe they will all sign."

    Detroit, under the surveillance of Ford's spies, is a notorious hotbed of fascist reaction. Auto company detectives are everywhere, and any worker suspected of progressive ideas is fired. However, here, the Stockholm Peace Signature Campaign is also underway. People are conducting signatures secretly, approaching workers individually in Ford, Dodge, Chrysler, and Cadillac factories.

    Since the United States intervened in the Korean War, more people have signed than in the past. In the first week of July, nearly 20,000 young people in Chicago signed. A young black woman in the city named Molly Rugas collected 1,300 signatures, and she collected 5,000 signatures from steelworkers near the Carnegie Illinois Steel Mill.

    The "American Women for Peace" delegation gathered in Washington on August 8, led by Dr. Barolini of New York, Dr. Yolanda Robinson—a famous anthropologist—and others. The representatives marched to Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House iron fence. They came to Washington to demand that the government take urgent action to outlaw the atomic bomb.

    The representatives walked from the White House to the State Department, where they protested the government's aggressive policies toward Korea and Taiwan.

    American peace advocates are seeking new ways to convey their will for peace to the people. One of these is the "chain letter" method, which was first used in the Midwest. The letter urges the recipient to "help stop an atomic world war, which will slaughter millions of innocent people and destroy American cities. Type five copies of this letter and send them to five of your friends, who will do the same. Then, send postcards, write letters, or call President Truman or your state's legislators. Tell them:
    (1) Let the representatives of the People's Republic of China participate in the United Nations;
    (2) Openly negotiate directly with the Soviet Union;
    (3) Ban atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs.
    If you love your family and want to protect your home, you should sign the Stockholm Peace Appeal."

    The unions are also taking a firm stand against preparing for another war. John Clark, president of the Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers Union, spoke at the Danville Union meeting on September 13, calling on union members to rise up and defend peace. Clark said:

    "We add our voice to the growing chorus of American groups and organizations demanding immediate action along two lines: First, end the Korean War through mediation.... Second, conduct negotiations to outlaw atomic and hydrogen bombs, stop the mad arms race, and seek peaceful solutions to all major disagreements."

    The authorities' attempts to intimidate peace fighters have not succeeded.

    In Oregon, the Hearst newspapers launched a hostile propaganda campaign against Archbishop Benjamin D. Dagwell because he signed the Stockholm Declaration. The Hearst newspapers roared that he had placed himself among "saboteurs" by associating with peace-loving progressives. The Archbishop's response to this was that he would rather associate with people who strive for peace than with those in the camp of warmongers.

    On August 2, a large peace demonstration was held in Union Square in New York, a place where New York's working-class district meets New York's wealthy district, a city full of skyscrapers, glamorous shops, and banks. When the demonstration was announced, the authorities ordered it banned. But despite the ban, people began to enter the square in small teams from nearby streets at the appointed time. More and more people joined the ranks, filling the sidewalks. They held up signs with slogans such as: "We want peace!", "Outlaw the atomic bomb!", "We want work!", "End the Korean War!" and other slogans.

    Hundreds of police attacked the demonstrators, rushing into the crowd and beating them left and right with batons, trying to disperse the demonstrators.

    Mounted police chased onto the sidewalks, driving people to the base of the walls and knocking many down with batons. At the corner of Fourth Avenue and Thirteenth Street, six strong police officers attacked a young black man, John Ivas. They knocked Ivas down, and one of them, a tall man with a long, horse-like face, stepped on his neck, slamming his face to the ground, while two others stomped on him. The fourth man bent down and handcuffed him with steel handcuffs.

    In another part of the square, William MacArthur, a sailor on a merchant ship, picked up a sign, climbed onto a telephone pole, and grabbed the crossbar, shouting: "Stop the Korean War! Withdraw American troops from Korea! No more arms production!"

    The police approached MacArthur, and two police officers tried to climb up the telephone pole, but failed. So, MacArthur continued to shake the sign and shouted: "I am a father. I know what war is, and I don't want another war. Sign the Peace Appeal and demand an end to the massacre in Korea!"

    At this time, a fire truck carrying hooks and ladders rushed to the square, breaking through the crowd. The ladder was set up, but even before the ladder was set up to the top of the telephone pole, the police climbed up the telephone pole and began to beat MacArthur with batons. He also fought back, but, of course, he was outnumbered. After being injured, he was thrown by the police into a patrol car.

    On September 14, the Magistrates' Court tried MacArthur's case. Here is what he said in court:

    "I have been involved in the labor movement for fifteen years. I know that if you want to win anything, you have to fight to win it. Some things are more important than being beaten, even more important than going to jail. Fighting for peace is one such thing. That explains why I went to Union Square."

    The American Gestapo threw MacArthur into prison. But there are more peace fighters like MacArthur in America. No reprisals or police terror can destroy their firm will. They are enabling broader sections of the American people to participate in the struggle for peace, and these people are beginning to understand that America's imperialist rulers are pushing the country into an abyss of disaster. Representatives of local unions of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations and various progressive organizations convened a meeting in New York in late September and passed a resolution. The resolution stated:

    "We are deeply inspired by the many sincere proposals for mediation put forward by people of various professions, races, religions, and political beliefs in our country. We believe that a peaceful future can be won."

　　美国进步人民为和平而斗争
    苏联奥兹罗夫
    在第二届世界保卫和平大会的前夕，美国争取和平的斗争愈益显得增长壮大了。甚至在这国际帝国主义的堡垒中，也有更多、更多的人民在谴责侵略和军备竞赛。九月底，斯德哥尔摩和平宣言的签名者已达到二百五十万人——而这是在和平宣言的每个拥护者几乎被控犯叛国罪的威胁下完成的。
    在布鲁克林发生过一件事情，它说明了美国和平拥护者们进行斗争时的一些情形。在南北战争阵亡将士纪念日——纪念在美国进行的历次战争中牺牲的人们——法西斯组织美国退伍军人会在布鲁克林某公园进行主张侵略的游行示威。在这群法西斯暴徒开始出发前不久，一辆又旧又破的汽车开到了公园门口。从车上跳下来四位青年男子与一位年青妇女：家具工人阿瑟·伊德尔曼，水手路易斯·马兹坎尼，纸匣工厂工人哈柏特·西尔尼克与乔治·德兹曼夫妇，他们两位都是学校教师。他们拿着白粉桶与刷笔。几分钟以后，退伍军人会的队伍与聚集在那里的观众们，便看见在人行道上与纪念牌坊上用三英尺大的字母写着这样的标语：“和平”，“禁止使用原子弹”及“禁止使用氢气弹”。但是就在那时，发出这种激动人心的和平呼声的人们，已被投入牢狱中。他们在公园门口被逮捕了，并被控以“恶意的捣乱”及“从事阴谋”罪状。那位在第二次世界大战中曾在太平洋上作过战的海军退伍军人阿瑟·伊德尔曼在被警察审问时说：“我看见我的朋友们去送死，我才决定展开和平运动。”结果，伊德尔曼被判一年徒刑，他的朋友们被判半年徒刑。
    像这样的事情，今天在美国是屡见不鲜的。
    在费城，有十五个人因散发斯德哥尔摩和平宣言而遭逮捕。审判这一案件的法官说这些人犯有“近似叛国罪”，并且认为写着斯德哥尔摩和平宣言全文与和平请愿书的传单，是这种“叛逆罪”的物证。这种司法的横暴行为，激起了人们抗议的怒潮。
    但是，任何威胁报复都不能摧毁和平战士们的意志。下面便是一个典型的例子。艾森豪威尔将军以哥伦比亚大学校长的资格，禁止学生们在校园散发斯德哥尔摩和平宣言。于是学生们将他们的活动移到第一百二十大街与百老汇角落的师范学院，并在两小时内征集到六百五十人签名。
    纽约一位年青的黑人女孩，名叫格罗尔雅·格拉维丝，她征集了几百位签名者，这是她在她工作的哥伦布区于午饭时从该区工人中，以及下工后在她住的地方哈伦姆区从工人中征集的。格拉维丝小姐说：她所接近的几乎每一个人都签了名。只有极少数人才害怕签名，说现在签署这样一个请愿书是“一件很危险的事情”。
    她发现年青人都欣然响应她的呼吁，其中很多人都对她说：“我参加过第二次世界大战，我不愿再参加另一次战争。”
    在纽约附近的海根沙克，劳工和平会议的人员在一小时内便征集了两百人签名。在某一家，他们碰见一位中年妇人——四个孩子的母亲，她的四个儿子参加第二次世界大战后都生还，但是邻居们却有很多人阵亡了。这位美国妇人一面签名一面说：“我要和平”。她并要了几份请愿书去，答应劝她的朋友们签名。她还说：“我相信他们都会签名的。”
    福特的密探监视下的底特律，是臭名昭著的法西斯反动派的温床。汽车公司暗探密布，任何有进步思想嫌疑的工人都被辞退。然而，在这里，斯德哥尔摩和平签名运动也在进行中。人们用秘密地，与工人个别接近的办法在福特、道奇、克利斯勒及加第拉克工厂里进行签名。
    美国从事干涉朝鲜战争以后，签名的人数比过去更多。在七月份第一周内，芝加哥签名的年青人便近两万人。该城一位年青的黑人妇女名叫摩莱·鲁加丝，她征集到一千三百人签名，她并在卡内基伊利诺斯大炼钢厂附近从钢铁工人中征集到五千人签名。
    “美国妇女争取和平”代表团于八月八日齐集华盛顿，为首的是纽约的巴奥隆尼博士、伊斯兰达·罗比逊博士——一位著名的人类学家——等人。代表们向白宫铁栏栅前面的宾夕尔凡尼亚大街前进。她们是来华盛顿要求政府采取紧急行动，宣布原子弹非法的。
    代表们从白宫走到国务院，她们向国务院抗议政府对朝鲜与台湾的侵略政策。
    美国和平拥护者正寻求新的方式，将他们争取和平的意志传达给人民。其中之一，便是中西部各州所最先使用的“连锁信”办法，该信敦促接信人“帮助制止原子世界战争，这战争将使数百万无辜的人民遭屠杀，使美国城市遭毁灭。将这信打字五份，分寄给你的五位朋友，他们再照样作下去。然后，再寄明信片，写信或打电话给杜鲁门总统或给你那一州的议员。告诉他们：
    （一）让人民中国的代表参加联合国；
    （二）公开与苏联直接谈判；
    （三）禁用原子弹与氢气弹等。
    如果你爱你的亲人，并愿保卫你的家庭，你就应该在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签名。”
    工会也采取坚决的立场反对准备另一次战争。矿山、工厂冶炼工人工会主席约翰·克拉克，在九月十三日丹维尔工会会议上发表谈话，号召工会会员们起来保卫和平。克拉克说道：
    “我们把我们的呼声加入美国各团体组织的日益高涨中的共同呼声里，它们要求沿两个方针立即采取行动：这两个方针就是：第一、经由调解结束朝鲜战争……。第二、进行谈判，以期宣布原子弹与氢气弹非法，制止疯狂的军备竞赛，寻求一切重大的分歧意见的和平解决。”
    当局恫吓和平战士的企图并未成功。
    在俄勒冈，赫斯特系的报纸对班加明Ｄ·达格威尔大主教进行敌视宣传运动，因为他在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。赫斯特系报纸咆哮说：由于与主张和平的进步人士结识，他便置身于“阴谋破坏分子”之列。大主教对这点的回答是：他宁愿结交争取和平的人们，而不愿与战争贩子阵营中的人士为伍。
    八月二日，在纽约联合广场举行了一次和平大示威游行，联合广场是纽约工人阶级所在地区与纽约富豪所在地区接境的地方，纽约是一个充满着摩天大楼、华丽商店与银行的城市。当示威游行一宣布时，当局便下令禁止。但是，尽管禁止，人们仍在指定时间从附近各大街小队地开始进入广场。参加队伍的人愈来愈多，挤满了人行道。他们高举着标语牌，上面写着：“我们要和平！”，“宣布原子弹非法！”，“我们要工作！”，“结束朝鲜战争！”等口号。
    几百警察进攻示威者，冲入人群中，用警棍左右殴打，企图驱散示威人群。
    骑警追到人行道上，将人们赶到墙根，并用警棍打倒很多人。在第四大街与第十三大街角落，六位强壮有力的警察袭击一位年青的黑人约翰·伊瓦斯。他们把伊瓦斯打倒，其中一人，有着一张长形马脸的大个子用脚踏着他的脖子，将他的脸碰在地上，另外两个人便用脚踩住他。第四个人便弯下腰，用钢手镣把他铐起来。
    在广场的另一处，一位商船上的水手威廉·麦加瑟拾起一块标语牌，爬到电线杆上去，并抓住横木高呼：“停止朝鲜战争！将美军从朝鲜撤回来！再不要生产军备！”
    警察走向麦加瑟，两个警察企图爬到电线杆上去，但未成功。于是，麦加瑟继续摇标语牌，大叫：“我是一个父亲。我懂得战争是什么，我不愿有另一次战争。签署和平宣言，要求停止在朝鲜的屠杀呵！”
    这时，载有钩子与梯子的救火车急驶到达广场，冲破人群。梯子架起来了，但甚至在梯子还未架到电线杆顶以前，警察便爬上电线杆，开始棒打麦加瑟。他也回击，但是，自然他是寡不敌众的。他被殴伤后，被警察丢到一辆巡逻车上。
    九月十四日，违警法庭审判麦加瑟的案子。下面便是他在法庭上说的话：
    “我从事劳工运动已十五年之久。我懂得：你要赢得任何东西，你便须用战斗来赢得。有些事情比挨打还更重要，甚至比坐牢还更重要。为和平而斗争就是这样的一件事情。这说明了为什么我要到联合广场去。”
    美国的盖斯塔波将麦加瑟投入狱中。但是，在美国还有更多像麦加瑟这样的和平战士。任何的报复手段或无论怎样的警察恐怖，都不能摧毁他们坚强的意志。他们正使美国更广泛阶层的人民参加和平斗争，这些人开始了解美国的帝国主义统治者们正将国家推入灾难的深渊。美国劳联与产联各地方工会以及各进步组织的代表们，于九月下旬在纽约召开了一次会议，通过一个决议。决议称：
    “我国各种不同职业、种族、宗教与政治信仰的人们提出很多真诚的调解建议，使我们深为感奋。我们相信：和平的将来是可以赢得的。”
