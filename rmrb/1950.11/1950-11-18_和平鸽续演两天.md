The dance drama "Peace Dove," performed by the Dance Troupe of the Central Academy of Drama, was originally scheduled to end on the 17th of this month. However, for the purpose of raising winter clothing to aid disaster victims, it has been decided to hold an additional charity performance on the 19th. At the same time, to accommodate various organizations, groups, and comrades from all walks of life who have not yet seen it, one extra performance will be added tonight (the 18th), in addition to the charity performance on the 19th. Tickets will be uniformly priced at 4,000 (all unreserved). After this, the troupe will have other tasks in Beijing and will not be performing any further.
