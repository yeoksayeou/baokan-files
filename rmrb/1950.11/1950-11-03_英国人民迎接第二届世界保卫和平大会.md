　　British People Welcome the Second World Peace Congress
    Crowther, Chairman of the British Peace Committee
    The British Peace Committee is actively preparing to welcome the Second World Peace Congress. The venue for the congress is the Sheffield City Hall, northwest of London. This is one of the newest and most beautiful buildings in England. It can accommodate nearly three thousand people.

    It is meaningful to hold the World Peace Congress in Sheffield, the center of British military industry, at a time when the imperialist war-mongers are accelerating their preparations for a new war at an alarming rate. The workers who produce armaments see with their own eyes and feel for themselves what the manufacture of destructive weapons is all about. They see how huge amounts of constructive human power and resources are wasted in the manufacture of guns, bombs, and thousands of other lethal weapons.

    They hate to see their skills and labor used for preparing for destruction; they deeply resent not being able to contribute their abilities to purely peaceful human construction endeavors—such as building hospitals, manufacturing scientific instruments to discover the secrets of nature, curing diseases, and providing all the industrial creations needed for civilized life. It is no wonder that many activists in the peace movement have emerged from among the munitions workers in England.

    In Sheffield, where plumes of smoke from various factories continuously fill the sky for miles, the workers there cannot but constantly feel apprehensive about the preparations for war.

    In the process of preparing for the Second World Peace Congress, the British Peace Committee is conducting full discussions focusing on several viewpoints and purposes in the Prague resolutions. One point should be explained: The British government, the leaders of the Labour Party and trade unions, the big capitalists, and their henchmen are fiercely attacking the British peace movement. British peace-loving people are preparing for the Second World Peace Congress under extremely difficult conditions. Although many trade union leaders are hostile to these peace advocates, many members of local branch unions who work in mines and factories generally have a more realistic and progressive understanding of the dangers of war and its impact on the people, and they enthusiastically support the British Peace Committee.

    The British Peace Committee is developing the organization of the peace movement among thousands of various groups in trade unions, cooperatives, teaching circles, student circles, scientific circles, and artistic circles. Therefore, it is easy to promote the demands of peace advocates in accordance with the Prague resolutions. Peace-loving people from all walks of life unanimously agree to reduce armaments and ban atomic weapons. They particularly abhor the imperialists' use of the United Nations as a tool to realize their aggressive ambitions.

    A total of 250 British representatives will attend the Second World Peace Congress. The majority of these representatives are allocated by region, with reference to population density and industrial importance. The London area has 40 representatives, including representatives from the London Dockworkers' Union, the Machine Workers' Union, and the Transport Workers' Union.

    The British Peace Committee is convening small meetings in public places, inside and outside schools, and at factory gates to explain how the British people can participate more meaningfully in the Second World Peace Congress, and how to elect representatives who will not betray their trust.

    During the preparation period for the Second World Peace Congress, British peace advocates continue to collect signatures for peace. They explain the meaning of defending peace to British men and women, asking them to sign. They also explain to them the significance of the convening of the Second World Peace Congress and the importance of the British people sending representatives to participate.

    In the weeks before the congress, the British peace propaganda team is preparing to travel around major cities across the country. They plan to hold a peace relay race, so that those participating in the relay race can travel through various villages and towns across the country. The peace propaganda team has designed a large number of peace vehicles, preparing to travel around the country in the week before the congress, distributing leaflets along the way to explain the Prague resolutions.

    The British Peace Committee has organized a reception committee to receive representatives from various countries attending the Second World Peace Congress. Fifty well-known British figures have volunteered to participate in the reception work.

    The British Peace Committee's preparation plan for the Second World Peace Congress is roughly as described above.

    Britain is one of the capitalist countries under great pressure from the United States. The British Peace Committee faces many difficulties in carrying out its work. Precisely because of this, the activities of the British people in striving for peace have exceptional importance.

    British peace advocates are doing their best to ensure the victorious success of the Second World Peace Congress. Because they know that doing so is a powerful contribution to the future of the British people, to the progress of all mankind, and to world peace. (Translated by Tie Jie from "New Times" Issue 41)

### 英国人民迎接第二届世界保卫和平大会

　　英国人民迎接第二届世界保卫和平大会
    英国和平委员会主席克劳瑟
    英国和平委员会为了迎接第二届世界保卫和平大会，积极进行着筹备工作。大会地点是在伦敦西北设菲尔德城的市政大厦。这是英国最新最优美的建筑物之一。全部座位可以容纳近三千人。
    在帝国主义战争贩子正以惊人的速度加紧进行新战争准备的今天，在英国军事工业中心设菲尔德城召开世界保卫和平大会是意味深长的。军备生产的工人们，亲眼看到，亲身感觉到，制造破坏性的武器是怎么一回事。他们看到建设性的人力和资源怎样巨量地浪费在枪炮炸弹及其他成千种杀人武器的制造方面。
    他们痛恨着自己的技能和劳力用于准备破坏的工作；他们深深地抱怨着：不能把他们的能力贡献给纯粹和平的人类建设事业——如建造医院，制造用以发见自然秘密的科学工具，医治疾病，以及供给文明生活需要的一切工业上的创造。在英国的军火工人中间涌现了许多保卫和平运动的积极分子，也就不足怪了。
    在设菲尔德，从各工厂冒出来的袅绕的煤烟接连好几英里地弥漫于天空——这地方的工人们是不能不对战争的准备经常感到忧惧的。
    英国和平委员会在筹备第二届世界和大的工作中间，是针对布拉格决议中的几项观点和宗旨进行充分的讨论的。有一点应当解释一下，英国的政府，工党和工会的领袖们，大资本家及其走狗们正以英国保卫和平运动为凶恶进攻的对象。英国爱好和平的人士是在极困难的情况下，进行着第二届和大的筹备工作。虽然很多工会的领导方面敌视这些和平拥护者，但许多地方分支工会的会员，在矿坑和工厂里做着工，一般地对战争的危险性及战争对人民的影响都有较现实的、较进步的了解，他们是热心赞助英国和平委员会的。
    英国和平委员会在工会、合作社、教师界、学生界、科学界、艺术界各方面数以千计的各种团体中间，发展着和平运动的组织。因此易于按照布拉格决议，推广和平拥护者们的要求。各方面爱好和平的人们无不赞成缩减军备和禁用原子武器。他们特别痛恶帝国主义者利用联合国作为实现他们侵略野心的工具。
    准备出席第二届和大的英国代表共计二百五十名。这些代表大多数是参照着人口密度和工业重要性按地区来分配的。在伦敦区就有四十名代表，其中包括伦敦的码头工会、机器工会和运输工会的代表。
    英国和平委员会在公共场所，在学校内外，在工厂门口召集着小型会议，解释英国人民怎样才能更有意义地参加第二届世界保卫和平大会，怎样选出一些不会辜负他们委托的代表。
    在第二届和大筹备期间，英国的和平拥护者们继续征集和平签名。他们向英国的男女解释保卫和平的意义，要求他们签名。又向他们解释第二届和大召开的意义以及英国人民选派代表参加的重要性。
    在大会召开前几星期中间，英国和平宣传队准备周游全国各大城市。他们计划举行一次和平接力赛，这样，参加接力赛的人们就可以遍经全国各村镇。和平宣传队设计了大批和平车，准备在大会前一星期中间巡历全国，沿路散发传单，解释布拉格决议。
    英国和平委员会已经组织了一个招待委员会，招待各国参加第二届和大的代表。英国知名人士已有五十人自动参加招待会工作。
    英国和平委员会对第二届和大的筹备计划大致就如此。
    英国是处在美国重大压力下的资本主义国家之一。英国和平委员会进行工作是有许多困难的。正因为如此，英国人民争取和平的活动有着异常重要的意义。
    英国的和平拥护者们正在尽心竭力要使第二届和大得到胜利的成就。因为他们知道这样做，才是对于英国人民的未来，对于全人类的进步，对于世界和平的有力贡献。（有铁节译自《新时代》四一期）
