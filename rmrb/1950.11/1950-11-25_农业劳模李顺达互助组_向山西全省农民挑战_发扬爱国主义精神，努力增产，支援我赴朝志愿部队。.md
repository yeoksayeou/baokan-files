　　Agricultural Labor Model Li Shunda Mutual Aid Group
    Challenges Farmers Throughout Shanxi Province
    Promote Patriotism, Strive for Increased Production, and Support Our Volunteer Troops in Korea.
    [This newspaper reports] Li Xiantang, Secretary of the Ping Shun County Party Committee in Shanxi, and correspondents Shen Yuanze and Li Cangzhu reported: Agricultural labor model Li Shunda, residing in Xigou Village, and the various mutual aid groups in the village, have launched a patriotic production competition and formulated a plan to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country, challenging farmers throughout the province. Farmers from various mutual aid groups in the village gathered on the night of the 8th and the morning of the 9th of this month to discuss the current situation. Men and women, young and old, in the mutual aid groups unanimously opposed the American imperialists' expansion of the war of aggression. Ma Haixing said, "The American imperialists are constantly bombing our Northeast and the coastal areas of Shandong. We must take precautions as soon as possible. We must ensure the completion of the autumn plowing plan in the rear, do a good job in winter production, increase wealth, and build a strong national defense and economic strength. As the saying goes, 'A rich people make a strong country.' As long as we all become prosperous and prepare all our strength, we are not afraid of the American imperialists' atrocities." Everyone was full of confidence in smashing the American imperialist aggression. Labor model Li Shunda proposed: In addition to completing a general plowing, we must do a good job in winter production to prepare for next year's production and strive for more increased production to support our volunteer troops in striking at the American imperialists. Under his leadership, the entire group formulated a production competition plan to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country.
    The Li Shunda Mutual Aid Group also launched a patriotic production competition challenge to all farmers in Shanxi. The challenge stated: "Recently, the American imperialists have frantically burned the flames of war to the doorstep of our motherland, seriously threatening our beautiful and happy life and the safety of our motherland. We must use combat actions on the production front to smash its provocative actions. This autumn, our entire group's average grain yield exceeded 75 percent of the pre-war level. Three-quarters of the autumn land has been plowed, and public grain has been prepared. In order to ensure enriching national defense and economic strength and defend our own motherland, we will exert a high degree of production enthusiasm. Our entire group is willing to launch a production competition challenge to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country to everyone. In the future, our entire group will resolutely implement Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions and guidelines that 'China must build a strong national defense force and a strong economic force,' constantly improve production enthusiasm, implement production mutual assistance, improve technology, cultivate intensively and meticulously, plant trees and forests, prevent various disasters such as waterlogging, drought, and insects, and strive to increase production by one dou per mu next year. In order to guarantee the realization of the above plan, we must do the following preparations this winter: First, we must ensure that the autumn land is generally plowed once, removing weeds, removing insects, and thoroughly turning the soil. Second, we must build and improve 2.5 mu of soil. Third, two-thirds of the new and old collapsed banks must be built before freezing, and all must be built before sowing next spring. Fourth, attention must be paid to improving the technology and quality of manure accumulation, and fertilizer must be applied according to the type of land. Next year, an average of 105 dan of fertilizer per mu must be achieved (an increase of 5 dan compared to this year). Fifth, the entire group must prepare enough firewood for eight months this winter. Sixth, all eight male laborers and four donkeys in the group will engage in transportation this winter to earn five shi of rice, which will be used for reproduction. Seventh, increase export goods, and the entire group will plant six mu of codonopsis. Eighth, the entire group will build seven new houses this winter and spring. Ninth, the entire group will purchase four hand hoes, three wide-board hollow hoes, three improved plows, and one improved cultivator this winter, and adopt new farm tools such as single-handle plows, new-style cultivators, and sprayers to improve productivity. Tenth, earnestly protect trees. In order to ensure the realization of the above work, we also put forward the following guarantee conditions: First, we must heighten our vigilance, strengthen public security and armed work, strictly prevent special agents from spreading rumors and sabotage, and expose counter-revolutionary rumors at all times and in all places. Second, we must strengthen the study of current affairs and culture, and establish a high degree of patriotism and internationalism. Third, we must give full play to the superiority of being organized, use labor and animal power scientifically, and strive to complete the winter production plan ahead of schedule. Fourth, we must practice careful calculation and strict budgeting, and expand reproduction with saved capital."
    Under the leadership of the Li Shunda Mutual Aid Group, all seven mutual aid groups in the village have formulated production competition plans to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country. The competition movement has now begun in the entire village.
