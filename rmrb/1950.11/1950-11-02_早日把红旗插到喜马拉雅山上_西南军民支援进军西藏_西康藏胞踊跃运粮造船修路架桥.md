Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 1st—The military and civilians in the Southwest Region are supporting the troops advancing into Tibet with the greatest determination, manpower, materials, and financial resources. Support work for the various troops began as early as early spring, and institutions were established to support the advance of brotherly troops into Tibet. From northern Sichuan to western Xikang, eastern Guizhou, and southern Yunnan, a wave of comfort activities unfolded everywhere among the brotherly troops. Each division of a certain army universally launched collective comfort movements by each company, platoon, squad, and soldier. When a certain unit stationed on the Yunnan border dispatched its own transportation troops to support the advance, it launched a "five-good" movement to guarantee good people, good horses, good guns, good saddles, and good supplies. A certain feeder confidently said: "My mule has crossed the Yellow River, crossed the Yangtze River, crossed the two Guangdongs, and arrived in Yunnan without ever falling behind. I guarantee it can complete the task of supporting the advance into Tibet!" When a certain unit's directly subordinate team held a mobilization meeting to support the troops entering Tibet, more than a thousand people enthusiastically signed up to participate. Many soldiers wrote guarantees proving that they were strong, brave, and ideologically firm, and went to the company headquarters to strive to receive the task of entering Tibet.

As early as this spring, the CPC Committee of the Southern Sichuan District organized a support committee for the advance into Tibet. The district party committee, administrative office, and military region organized a comfort group to go to a certain place to comfort the troops, carrying a large amount of wine, dried longan, sugar, and tea. Farmers in various counties in southern and western Sichuan also wrote letters to comfort the troops entering Tibet, expressing their determination to support the advance by "paying public grain early and stepping up production." Employees of the Yibin China Paper Mill, farmer representatives from Emei County, and all employees of a certain factory in Emei County, hope to plant the red flag they donated on the Himalayas!

With the enthusiastic support of the brotherly troops and the people of various places, the advancing troops were extremely excited and expressed their determination to resolutely complete the glorious task of advancing into Tibet and never disappoint the support and earnest expectations of the brotherly troops and the Party, government, army, and people!

Xinhua News Agency, Kang Tibetan Front, 1st—Tibetan compatriots in various places along the Jinsha River and Yalong River in central Xikang are enthusiastically helping the People's Liberation Army advancing into Tibet to transport grain, build boats, repair roads, and build bridges. Tibetan compatriots on the east bank of the Jinsha River mobilized more than 2,000 people to build a large number of wooden boats and leather boats for the troops to use. Many Tibetan boatmen, carpenters, and blacksmiths on the west bank of the Yalong River also organized themselves to rush to build boats for the troops to cross the river day and night. Women, like men, organized porter teams to help the troops carry weapons, ammunition, and supplies so that the troops could quickly board and disembark. Tibetan women from Lihua and Ba'an counties assisted the PLA engineers in transporting timber from the mountains thirty miles away and also helped the troops blast rocks to open roads. Tibetan compatriots in Yajiang County on the east bank of the Yalong River, regardless of men or women, automatically participated in road construction. Herdsmen from Niuchang near Lihua organized thousands of water buffalo to assist in transportation. Tibetan compatriots with water mills on the banks of the Jinsha River also milled dry food for the troops day and night. Young Tibetan compatriots in various places actively followed the army to serve as translators, propagandists, and guides.
