Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 22nd: The Second World Peace Congress passed the "Declaration to the People of the World," which states: War threatens humanity—men, women, and children. The United Nations has failed to live up to the hopes that the peoples of all nations placed in it to maintain peace and security. The lives of people and the achievements of human culture are in danger!

The people of all nations hope that the United Nations will resolutely return to the principles upon which it was founded after World War II, in order to guarantee freedom, peace, and mutual respect among nations.

However, the people of the world must rely more on themselves, more on their own determination and goodwill. Every sensible person can see very clearly: Whoever insists that "war is inevitable" is slandering all of humanity.

When you read this message passed in Warsaw by representatives from eighty countries at the Second World Peace Congress, remember: The struggle for peace is your own personal matter. You must know that hundreds of millions of peace fighters have united and extended their hands to you. They call on you to participate in the noblest struggle ever undertaken by mankind, who firmly believes in its future.

Peace must not be waited for; it must be striven for. Let us work together to demand an end to the war that is ravaging Korea today and will plunge the whole world into flames tomorrow.

Let us oppose attempts to rekindle the flames of war in Germany and Japan.

Let us, along with the 500 million people who signed the Stockholm Appeal, demand: the prohibition of atomic weapons, universal disarmament, and the supervision of the implementation of these measures. Strict supervision of universal disarmament and the destruction of atomic weapons is technically possible. All that is needed is the willingness to do so.

Let us enforce the passage of laws to make war propaganda a punishable crime. Let us submit the peace proposals drafted by the Second World Peace Congress to our parliamentarians, to our governments, and to the United Nations.

The peace forces of all countries are strong enough, and the voice of the world's people is loud enough, to jointly insist on the convening of a meeting of representatives from the five major powers.

The Second World Peace Congress has provided unprecedentedly powerful proof that people from all over the globe, despite differing viewpoints, can still reach agreements to avoid the disaster of war and maintain peace.

Let the governments of all nations act in the same way, and the cause of peace can be saved.

　　第二届世界保卫和平大会
    告全世界人民的宣言
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社华沙二十二日讯：第二届世界保卫和平大会通过“告全世界人民的宣言”，宣言称：战争威胁着人类——男女和儿童。联合国辜负了各国人民所赋予它的维护和平与安宁的希望。人民的生活和人类文化的成就正处在危险之中！
    各国人民希望联合国坚决地回到在第二次世界大战后它所赖以建立的原则上去，以保证自由、和平及各国间的相互尊重。
    但是，世界人民还须要更多地靠他们自己，更多地靠他们自己的决心和善意。每一个明理的人都看得很清楚：凡是硬说“战争不可避免”的人，都是在诽谤全人类。
    当你们读到第二届世界保卫和平大会代表八十个国家的人民在华沙通过的这篇文告时，你们要记住：争取和平的斗争是你们自己的切身的事情。你们要知道：几万万和平斗士已经团结起来，把他们的手伸给你们。他们号召你们参加坚信其前途的人类所曾进行的最崇高的斗争。
    绝不能等待和平，必须去争取和平。让我们一致努力，要求停止今日蹂躏着朝鲜而明日势将把全世界投入火焰的战争。
    让我们反对再度在德国和日本燃起战争的企图。
    让我们与在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的五亿人民共同要求：禁止原子武器，普遍裁减军备，监督这些措施的施行。对普遍裁减军备的严格监督及原子武器的销毁，在技术上是可能的。所需要的只是这样做的意愿。
    让我们强制通过法律，使战争宣传成为应当受惩罚的罪行。让我们把第二届世界保卫和平大会所草拟的我们的保卫和平的建议提交我们的议会议员们，提交我们的政府，提交联合国。
    一切国家的和平力量足够强大，世界人民的声音足够响亮，足可共同坚持召开五大国代表会议的主张。
    第二届世界保卫和平大会空前有力地证明：从全球各地来的人们，尽管观点不同，仍然能够达成协议，来避免战争的灾难与维持和平。
    让各国政府同样地行动起来，那么，和平事业就可以得到挽救。
