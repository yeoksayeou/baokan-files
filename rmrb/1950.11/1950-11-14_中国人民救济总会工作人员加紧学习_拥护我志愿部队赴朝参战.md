　　Staff of the China People's Relief Association Intensify Studies
    Supporting Our Volunteer Army's Participation in the Korean War
    [This Newspaper Reported] All staff members of the China People's Relief Association are intensifying their study of the issue of resisting America and aiding Korea, and many have signed up to join the Volunteer Army. Recently, in response to the joint declaration of the democratic parties, written opinions were also published, stating in brief: "All the staff members of the China People's Relief Association wholeheartedly support and accept this righteous declaration issued by the democratic parties. We can no longer tolerate the American imperialist aggressors' wanton acts of bestiality, continuing to slaughter peaceful residents in Korea, destroying the monuments and culture created by the sweat of labor, and creating new disasters. In order to defend our factories and construction, to defend the abundant grains in our fields and the infinite treasures underground, to defend our hometowns, to defend our vigorously developing young People's Republic of China, to protect the safety of the Asian people, and to safeguard lasting world peace, we resolutely support the Volunteer Army crossing the Yalu River to fight our most brutal and ferocious enemy, American imperialism.

    Moreover, we solemnly swear: We must take action, we are ready for everything, charge towards the enemy, forward!"
