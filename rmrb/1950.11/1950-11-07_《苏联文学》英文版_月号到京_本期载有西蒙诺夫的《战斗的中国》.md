    English Edition of "Soviet Literature" – October Issue Arrives in Beijing
    This Issue Contains Simonov's "Fighting China"
    The October issue of the English edition of "Soviet Literature" has arrived in Beijing. This issue publishes Simonov's lengthy reportage "Fighting China." This article was written in the autumn of 1949 when the author, as the deputy head of the Soviet literary, artistic, and scientific workers delegation, led the delegation to China. Later, as a correspondent for *Pravda*, he followed the People's Liberation Army field troops in their advance into the Great Southwest, witnessing the reality of the Chinese people's great victory. The full text is 110 pages long. It recounts the author's "unforgettable" journey. Through this work, the author reported to the world how this steel-like army fought bravely and organized victory. The author was originally a writer skilled in writing reportage, especially good at writing about soldiers. "Days and Nights" is a representative work in this regard, and "Fighting China" is a new successful work by the author in this field.
    In addition, this issue also published 19 special articles by Soviet cultural workers defending peace, the important ones being: Surkov's "The Ranks of Life," Pedin's "Struggling for the Happiness of the People," Babayevsky's "Harvest of Peace," Gonchar's "Striving for Peace," Gerasimov's "Striving for Lasting Peace," and Alexandrov's "Peace Will Surely Defeat War."

　　《苏联文学》英文版—月号到京
    本期载有西蒙诺夫的《战斗的中国》
    《苏联文学》英文版十月号到京。本期发表了西蒙诺夫的长篇报告文学《战斗的中国》。此文系一九四九年秋天、作者以苏联文学艺术科学工作者代表团副团长名义率该团到达中国，后又以真理报记者身份随人民解放军野战部队进军大西南，目击了中国人民伟大的胜利的实况所写成。全文长达一百一十页。记述了作者这次“永远不会忘掉”的旅行。通过这篇作品，作者向全世界报道了这支钢铁般的队伍怎样英勇善战并怎样组织胜利。作者原是一个善于写报告文学，尤其善于写士兵的作家，“日日夜夜”是这方面的代表作，《战斗的中国》是作者这方面的新的成功作品。
