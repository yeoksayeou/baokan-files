Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, October 31st: TASS reports: *Pravda* columnist, Kolionov, commented on Acheson's speech at a press conference in Washington on October 14th, in which Acheson stated the U.S. attitude towards the Eight Foreign Ministers' statement.

Kolionov stated: The Eight Foreign Ministers' statement has caused great anxiety among the U.S. ruling group. Acheson's attempt to say that the Eight Foreign Ministers' statement is unacceptable confirms how much the Western countries hate the Potsdam Agreement. Acheson's "new method" of solving the German problem is a way to revive German imperialism and lead to new wars. Acheson could not refute the facts listed in the Eight Foreign Ministers' statement regarding the remilitarization of West Germany, and his groundless statement that "West Germany is not armed" is shameless. Everyone knows that the West German war industry, restored by U.S. imperialism, is expanding the production of tanks, aircraft parts, and ammunition, and the German army, led by former fascist officers and numbering nearly 500,000, has been rebuilt.

Kolionov continued: The central issue raised in the Eight Foreign Ministers' statement is the issue of a peace treaty with Germany and the establishment of a central German government. The Soviet Union has always insisted on the quickest possible preparation of a peace treaty with Germany. Acheson's rejection of the suggestions in the Eight Foreign Ministers' statement, aimed at resolving the German problem as soon as possible in the interests of peace and international security, further reveals the aggressive nature of U.S. policy. But peace-loving people will reject the imperialist foreign policy and support the path to genuine peace pointed out in the Eight Foreign Ministers' statement.

　　八国外长声明影响巨大
    引起美统治集团极大不安
    真理报指出艾奇逊的无耻演说进一步显露美国政策的侵略性质
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报专栏作家科里奥诺夫，于二十九日评论艾奇逊十月十四日在华盛顿招待记者会上发表的演说，艾奇逊在这个演说中表明了美国对于八国外长会议声明的态度。
    科里奥诺夫称：八国外长声明已引起美国统治集团的极大不安。艾奇逊竭力说八国外长声明是不能接受的，这就证实了西方国家是如何痛恨波茨坦协定。艾奇逊的解决德国问题的“新办法”，是复活德国帝国主义，导向新战争的办法。艾奇逊无法辩驳八国外长声明中所列举的关于西德重新军国主义化的事实，而毫无根据地说“西德并无武装”，这种说法是无耻的。谁都知道，由美国帝国主义加以恢复的西德战争工业，正在扩大生产坦克、飞机零件及弹药，由旧日法西斯军官率领的人数几达五十万的德国陆军，已经重建起来了。
    科里奥诺夫继称：八国外长会议声明提出的中心问题，是对德和约和建立德国中央政府的问题。苏联始终坚持最迅速地准备对德和约。艾奇逊拒绝了八国外长声明中旨在根据和平及国际安全的利益尽早解决德国问题的建议，就进一步显露了美国政策的侵略性质。但爱好和平的人民将摈弃帝国主义的外交政策，拥护八国外长声明中指出的引向真正和平的道路。
