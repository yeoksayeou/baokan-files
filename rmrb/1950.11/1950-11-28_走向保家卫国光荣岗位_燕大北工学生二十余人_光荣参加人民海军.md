　　Marching Towards the Glorious Post of Defending the Homeland
    Over Twenty Students from Yanjing University and Beijing Institute of Technology Honorably Join the People's Navy
    [Our Newspaper] In the upsurge of resisting America and aiding Korea, twelve students from the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Yanjing University, including Xiao Yaohui and Zhao Jixin, and ten students from the Department of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering of Peking University Institute of Technology, including Wang Liang and Wang Zuoting, joined the People's Navy, undertaking the glorious task of defending the homeland. On the 22nd, the two schools held send-off meetings respectively. At the send-off meetings, Yanjing University President Lu Zhiwei and Beijing Institute of Technology President Ma Dayou respectively explained the importance of participating in the naval work based on the painful facts that China had been bullied by imperialism and suffered from American imperialist aggression due to the weakness of its navy in the past, and encouraged the students joining the navy to work hard in their new positions. Representatives from the Communist Party branches, Communist Youth League branches, and student unions of the two schools also spoke, encouraging them to work hard and strive to build a strong People's Navy. The students who joined the work delivered speeches, expressing their determination not to disappoint everyone's expectations. Many departmental-level students from the two schools delivered speeches, presented gifts, and dedicated poems, expressing their willingness to follow them and be prepared to contribute everything to the motherland at any time. The representative of the Yanjing University Communist Youth League who presented the gift delivered a speech, hoping that the students participating in the navy would strive to be glorious Bolsheviks in their work. The Department of Western Languages sent a dozen towels, urging them not to forget the meaning of Chairman Mao's statement on self-criticism: "The face should be washed frequently; if it is not washed, it will be covered with dust."
    The students who joined the work were warmly supported by the faculty and students of the school. The ten students from Beijing Institute of Technology were given glorious big red flowers at the send-off meeting.
