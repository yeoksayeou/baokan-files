Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 14th -- The Finance Department of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee has issued a circular instructing all localities to correct the tendency of neglecting grain quality in the autumn grain collection work, and requiring all localities to do a good job in storage management.

In some areas of Southwest China, serious mold and rot risks have already occurred in stored grain. In Bazhong County, Northern Sichuan District, more than two million catties of grain have become moldy. In Jiangjin County, Eastern Sichuan District, grain in three districts has become generally heated. One reason for the grain spoilage is that there was much rain in the autumn, and the grain could not be fully sun-dried. The main reason, however, is that some grain collection cadres have a point of view in their work that focuses solely on completing the task in terms of quantity, seeking speed and not paying attention to the quality of the grain. They emphasize completing the task within a deadline, collecting very poor quality rice into storage, such as moldy and rotten rice, unripe green rice, water-soaked and mud-sprouted rice, and even refuse warehouse personnel to inspect, forcing the warehouse to accept it. In addition, the lack of preparation for warehousing in advance, and failure to inspect and repair, is also one of the reasons for the phenomenon of grain spoilage.

To this end, the Finance Department of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee has issued a circular, making the following specific provisions: 1. Governments and finance and grain departments at all levels should establish unified leading organs in the collection and storage work, and grain collection personnel should ensure the collection of dry and good grain into storage. 2. Those who have insufficient warehousing conditions or poor preparation should immediately remedy them. 3. In areas where the grain quality is relatively humid, it is not advisable to rush into storage, and the collection may be postponed depending on the circumstances, and grain delivery should be stopped on rainy days. 4. For grain that has already been put into storage with poor quality, it is necessary to promptly turn, ventilate, and sun the grain.

　　西南军政委会财政部指示各地
    纠正征粮忽视品质偏向
    保证干粮好粮入仓；抓紧翻仓和曝晒
    【新华社重庆十四日电】西南军政委员会财政部已发出通报，指示各地纠正秋征工作中不重视粮食品质的偏向，要求各地做好入仓保管工作。
    西南若干地区入库粮食已经发生严重的霉烂危险。川北区巴中县已有二百多万斤粮食发霉，川东区江津县有三个区的粮食已普遍发热。粮食霉烂原因之一，是入秋多雨，粮食不能充分曝晒；更主要原因则是少数征粮干部工作中存在着单纯在数量上完成任务的观点，只求快，不注意粮食的品质。他们强调限期完成任务，将品质很坏的稻谷，如霉头烂谷，未熟青谷，水湿泥芽谷等征收入仓，甚至拒绝仓库人员检查，强迫仓库接受。此外，仓储事前没有准备，未加检查修理也是粮食发生霉烂现象的原因之一。
    为此，西南军政委员会财政部特发出通报，作如下具体规定：一、各级政府与财政粮食部门在征收及入仓工作上，应建立统一的领导机关，征粮人员应保证征干粮好粮入仓。二、凡仓储条件不够或准备较差者，应立即加以补救。三门在征收及入仓工作上，应建立统一的领导机关，征粮人员应保证征干粮好粮入仓。二、凡仓储条件不够或准备较差者，应立即加以补救。三、谷质潮湿比较严重的地区，不宜急于入仓，并可斟酌情况缓征，下雨天应停止送粮。四、已入仓的品质坏的粮食，必须抓紧进行翻仓、通风和曝晒。
