　　The Current International Situation and Italy's National Interests
　　Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti
　　Since the US Imperialists Launched the War of Aggression Against Korea
　　Factors of Political Crisis in Italy are Maturing Daily
　　As a result of the events in Korea, the factors of a serious political crisis in Italy have been maturing daily and becoming increasingly apparent.

　　Even before the events in Korea, the situation of the current Italian government was unstable. It is enough to recall certain events, such as the debates on the most pressing economic and political issues, the disagreements at every step within the government camp and the ruling party, and the scandals that have caused a sensation and continue to resonate in public opinion. Some have shamelessly argued that the development of the Korean events would be beneficial to the government. Superficially, it seems as if this is indeed the case. Under the banner of a reckless anti-communist movement and intensified military preparations, certain disagreements between the Christian Democratic Party and its satellite parties seem to have been put aside. However, all of this is merely superficial and not the essence of our country's political life. On the contrary, our country and our people have been dragged into, or are being dragged into, a situation that is even more ambiguous than before. In addition to the panic caused by the government's actions, there is also anxiety about the future, all of which is powerfully shaking the foundations of the Christian Democratic Party's regime.

　　Precisely because of this, Gasperi was able to declare that the Korean events are the most important factor in the current situation in Italy. In a sense, he is right, because due to the Italian government's attitude towards this event, the issue that determines the people's lives and their future—the issue of war and peace—has been placed on the agenda. Under the influence of this event, deep contradictions have matured much faster than before, and the Italian government has shown more clearly than before that it is not the kind of government that Italy needs. It has shown that it cannot understand the increasingly complex international and domestic situation, and has exposed its inability to adhere to a line that protects national interests, a line that a government worthy of the name should implement. The Gasperi government has exposed a sinister intention to lead Italy down a path of adventure, a path that fascism once followed, leading Italy to disaster. This is evidenced by the international obligations accepted by the Gasperi government on behalf of the interests of foreign imperialism, as well as the incitement of ideological fanaticism and war hysteria.

　　As the Korean events develop, this becomes increasingly clear to the overwhelming majority of the Italian people.

　　Oppose American Aggression Against China and Korea, Advocate Freedom for the Asian People
　　There is no need to repeat our views on the Korean events here. I believe that this view is already known and understood by the majority of sober-minded and upright people. I will only speak about two basic issues:

　　1. The United States' open attack on the Asian people is due to the American imperialists' attempt to retaliate against the heroic Chinese people for the shameful defeat they suffered in past years under the leadership of their Communist Party.

　　In order to maintain and expand its oppression and exploitation of the Asian people, the American imperialists, despite suffering defeat in their struggle against the Chinese people, continue to carry out new aggression, attempting to infringe upon the rights of the Chinese people and other Asian people to realize their freedom, independence, and unity, to infringe upon their right to establish internal lives that conform to their wishes, habits, and interests, and to infringe upon their right not to allow foreign imperialist interference in their internal affairs. This is the first aspect of the Korean events.

　　2. The second aspect of the Korean events—which may not be so obvious today, but is even more serious than the first—is that the leaders of American policy are attempting to transform the anti-Soviet "Cold War" into a "hot war," dragging the so-called West and the entire world into a new destructive war.

　　No sober-minded and upright Italian would think that we Italians would be willing in any way for American imperialism to re-consolidate itself on the Asian continent as it launches a war against the Korean and Chinese people in order to establish its own colonial rule. No sober-minded and upright Italian would think that Italy would be willing in any way for the imperialist and colonial expansion carried out by the United States through armed intervention to be successful. We are such a country that has repeatedly participated in the competition with the great imperialist bandits due to the will of its own rulers, but the result of this conflict has always been its disintegration. We Italians only want the people of the Far East to escape the shackles of foreign imperialism, to open up their markets and allow us to trade with them according to their wishes, and to eliminate the American and other imperialist monopolies in this region of the world, so that our country can benefit from this trade. This is our wish. We absolutely do not want the Korean people to fail, and we absolutely do not want China to be plunged into a new destructive war by the American imperialists.

　　Italy Must Not Follow America's Anti-Soviet Adventure
　　True Interests Lie in Friendship with China and the Soviet Union
　　As for the growing efforts of American foreign policy leaders to instigate a new war in order to consolidate and strengthen the anti-Soviet bloc of Western countries, in addition to expressing our undisguised sympathy for socialist and people's democratic countries, we believe that pushing Italy hard to oppose the people's democratic countries, people's China, and the Soviet Union is in no way in line with national interests. On the contrary, we objectively are happy to maintain friendly relations with these countries, so that we can exchange goods with them and expand commerce with them. This is our interest, and only this.

　　Some say that war should be waged to prevent the spread of communist doctrines and to prevent the truth about socialism and people's democratic regimes from spreading. I don't think this is in the interest of the Italian nation either. It is true that there is a "strong power" within Italy, whose entire activity, as people say, in terms of "ideological motives," is to protect one view and eliminate another doctrine. However, this "strong power" is not the Italian nation, but the Vatican—the realm of the Roman Pope. I will assume that the Roman Pope, in order to condemn this doctrine and this social form, deems it necessary to take measures to stop the spread of socialism. But what does this have to do with the Italian nation? If the Pope, who has adopted a reckless policy towards socialism in many places (which harms his own Catholic Church), believes that war should also be waged to stop the spread of doctrines and social systems that he disagrees with; then would he not become the leader of a country that even has its own army? Let him declare war on the Soviet Union, declare war on the people's democratic countries, and declare war on Mao Zedong's China! Let him mobilize his Swiss Guards, dress them in their beautiful uniforms to march (our Raphael painted them), and let him organize teams of Catholic monks, friars, or leaders of "Catholic Action" and send them to fight! But this has nothing to do with the Italian nation; the Italian nation is completely unwilling to do this. The Italian nation, if it had rulers who were responsible to the nation and cared about the lives and existence of the Italian people, should in no way engage in military adventures.

　　Gasperi Government Forbids Public Discussion of Korea
　　Because His Arguments Cannot Withstand the People's Blow
　　Therefore, neither making our country support the United States in the Far East, nor making our country follow the United States' anti-Soviet adventure, can be in line with national interests. However, the entire activity of the Italian government is precisely the opposite of what it should be doing. As soon as the United States began its aggression against Korea, the Italian rulers, as if they had seen a signal, were encouraged to become advocates of the ideas and schemes of their fascist predecessors (who had for many years placed Italy in the nightmare of preparing for war, waging war, and failing in war). Some of the measures taken by the Italian government now are already well known. For example, the movement to collect signatures for the Stockholm Appeal was banned. This ban cannot but be considered foolish and ridiculous. In Italy, there are the Communist Party and the Socialist Party, which have millions of members, and there is a front composed of eight or nine million democratic voters. In this situation, can one really believe that this ban will be effective? The will shown by the urban and rural residents in demanding the ban on atomic weapons is even greater than its political manifestation. This is the expression of the sentiment of millions of people who are willing to protect their homes and their lives.

　　Our opponents say that collecting signatures is useless. This is not true. Because when everyone knows that hundreds of millions of men and women around the world are signing not only considering their own fate, but also considering the fate of all mankind, it means that mankind has taken a big step forward in the struggle to save peace.

　　The Italian government forbids talking about Korea in the streets. In Italy, Korea can only be talked about in secret places. On the streets, one can only talk about Gasperi, who declared that the Korean events are the most important factor in our country's situation. Our organization has held tens of thousands of meetings in secret places, where it has explained to millions of people the significance of the American aggression against Korea, and how absurd the Gasperi government's declaration of sympathy for this aggression is.

　　What does it mean to forbid public discussion of Korea? This means that Mr. Gasperi, Mr. Sforza, the leaders of the ruling Christian Democratic Party, the "Catholic Action," and the heads of the vassal small parties all recognize that in the public square, in front of the people, their arguments cannot withstand the blow of our arguments. Therefore, they are trying to shut our mouths. However, everyone knows that Mussolini also thought he could shut our mouths, and also believed that he could achieve victory, but Mussolini only led the country to disaster. Today, we should prevent disaster.

　　The Soviet People's Democratic Countries are Powerful
　　Whoever Dares to Lay Hands on Them Will Be Playing with Fire
　　Furthermore, everyone also knows that they are still trying to declare all those who disagree with the views of the current rulers as the "Fifth Column." To insist that a considerable part of the Italian people, the parties which have one-third of the deputies in the Lower House and almost half of the seats in the Upper House are the "Fifth Column"—this is truly the height of political ignorance. We are called the "Fifth Column" because we do not want Italy to join the anti-Soviet front and do not want Italy to be dragged onto the road of anti-Soviet war. Absolutely correct: we absolutely do not want our country to participate in the anti-Soviet bloc. We will do everything in our power to oppose our country being involved in the war against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

　　Why do we take such a position? First of all, because we, like all people, see progress and a new type of civilization achieved in struggle and labor from the Soviet Union. The attempt to incite Italy to oppose this democratic, progressive, and peace-loving country is an evil that we should prevent.

　　But another reason should also be obvious to everyone. We do not want Italy to participate in the anti-Soviet front and be dragged into the war that is currently being prepared, because we do not want Italy to suffer defeat. Let our opponents try to take this seriously. Mussolini's "eight million soldiers" and Bazzaglia's "forty divisions"—these are the boastful claims that have been exposed by history in the past and will be exposed by history in the future. From the heart of Europe to the eastern border of Asia, the strength of the socialist countries and the people's democratic countries lies not only in their industrial, agricultural, and political power, but first and foremost in the spiritual superiority of these united and inspired people, who recognize that they are working to create a new world, and tomorrow they will also be able to fight to defend a high degree of civilization and happiness. This power is invincible. We want to prevent Italy from suffering new defeats, prevent new destruction, and prevent repeating the mistake of sending expeditionary forces abroad and returning as prisoners of war. Let everyone know: whoever lays hands on the people is playing with fire.

　　Perhaps some will retort that we are discussing this issue too early. We do not want to argue with him. What is important is that we ask our political opponents, the Prime Minister of the Italian government, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the leaders of the parties that make up the coalition government to answer this question: When has the Soviet Union allowed any action that threatened the Italian nation, so that the Italian nation must tomorrow be thrown into a war against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries? Please point out this action. This question has not been answered in the past, and will never be answered in the future. In fact, this action does not exist. Since there has been a Soviet Union in the world, this action has never existed. Looking back, it can be said that even old Russia never took a position against Italy that required the Italian nation to defend itself. When Mussolini threw Italy into the anti-Soviet war, his only argument, apart from the thinkers of "Catholic Action," was an assertion that it was necessary to follow Hitler; this meant moving towards failure, towards total annihilation, and towards the destruction of millions of Italians. Our opponents cannot answer this question, which means that even they themselves admit that their designs on the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are aggressive designs directed by American and British imperialism—the most reactionary forces remaining in the world.

　　The Italian Government Opens the Door for the Invasion of American Troops
　　The Italian People are Determined to Drive Out the Robbers and Not be Tools of War
　　Some accuse us, saying that we Italian communists are willing to open our country's doors to foreign troops in times of war. In reality, this is not the case at all. Who opens our country's doors to foreign powers and lets them build their own military bases in our country? It is the Italian government, which signed the Atlantic Pact and concluded military agreements that even it itself is ashamed to admit.

　　We demand that the government make a solemn guarantee to the Italian people publicly that they have not accepted any such obligation, due to which, no matter how the situation in the Far East or Europe develops, American troops can enter our territory, send warships to our ports, send airplanes to our airports, and turn Italy into a base for its own military operations in this way or other ways. We demand that the government do this, and we declare that if this guarantee is made, it will greatly help to relax the domestic tension. But until now, there has been no such guarantee, and we know that it will not make this guarantee. It is the responsibility of the Italian people to resolve to drive out the foreign robbers for whom our rulers have opened our country's doors.

　　We demand, once again demand, that the Italian government guarantee that the government will not take any action that would turn Italy into a base or serve as a tool of war for the benefit of foreigners. We demand a guarantee that the government is determined to abandon the actions it has prepared to take to do this, and we tell the government that only in this way can the degree of domestic tension be relaxed.

　　They threaten us with emergency measures. We are already accustomed to this. The Italian bourgeoisie is always ready to intervene in war, and when they see that the resistance of the people who have experienced two wars against their evil plans is maturing, they want to take emergency measures. The Italian Minister of Justice has made such a truly shocking judicial discovery: he has invented pre-arrest warrants. Everyone knows that arrest warrants are a document issued when someone has committed a crime. But our Minister of Justice already knows who is going to commit a crime in the future, and has prepared arrest warrants for these people in advance!

　　Defense Minister Bazzaglia Shouts About Winning the War
　　He is Just Chewing on Mussolini's Leftovers
　　Defense Minister Bazzaglia's recent statement is also noteworthy. He announced his own intention to liquidate (when the situation is ripe for the government to decide to do this) about four hundred Italian citizens. At the same time, the Defense Minister has "deprived" these Italians of our country's citizenship. This statement should be taken extremely seriously, first of all because this person is the leader of the Italian military intelligence agency, which participated in the murder of the anti-fascist Rosselli brothers as early as the fascist era. If we recall this murder and compare it with Bazzaglia's recent statement, then the events of July 14 (July 14, 1948 was the day of the assassination attempt on Comrade Togliatti—editor's note) take on a special significance.

　　However, Bazzaglia's statement has nothing new or original. In Italy, this person who has deprived a group of Italian citizens of their nationality declares that a few hundred "conspirators" must be eliminated, then everything will go smoothly, and he will win the war. Poor Bazzaglia can only chew on Mussolini's leftovers.

　　Everyone knows that Marx wrote that certain events and individuals appear twice in history, but the first time they appear as a tragedy, and the second time they appear as a farce. In this case, what we encounter is a farce. Moreover, I think that, in the final analysis, although Mussolini committed many crimes against Italy, he was essentially a clown. Bazzaglia is a clown imitating a clown and a brainless braggart.

　　As a result of the absurd policies adopted by our rulers towards Korea, such a serious situation has been created in Italy that in our country, which is eager for peace and unity, the atmosphere of war preparation and civil war is becoming increasingly thick. Deep bewilderment can be seen in the middle class, and even panic in some classes. All of this is to be blamed on the government, and on its policies that have nothing in common with Italy's interests.

　　The Italian Communist Party Calls on the People to Fight for Peace and Unity
　　The Current Task is to Expand and Maintain Unity with the People
　　In this situation, we once again announce what we are fighting for, and what kind of call we are issuing to the Italian people. We are fighting to keep our country at peace, and not to participate in any adventure that deepens the division of Europe and the world, an adventure that leads to mutual provocation, an adventure that encourages American imperialism to attack the Asian people, and may involve our country in an unfortunate conflict that will inevitably crush our country.

　　We are fighting for peace and for the unity of the Italian people, so we not only call on workers, advanced peasants, and other advanced forces, but also call on residents of the middle class and the wealthy class. We tell all Italians: You must be vigilant, you must be alert, you must ask your own conscience: Is it just that Italy has taken such a tragic step, only because there are leaders of the "Catholic Action" who, because of their madness, dream of ideological wars and religious wars, only because there are such rulers who, after gaining power with the help of foreign imperialism, believe that they now have the right to pay off their personal debts with the price of peace, with the price of Italian blood?

　　This call of ours will be answered. We do not expect the entire middle class to turn to our side, but we expect them to consider and believe that our call to the people—this call of reason and warning—is a call for peace and unity.

　　In such a tense struggle, where the battle lines have already been drawn, where is the basis for unity? This basis is laid down in our constitution, which we have jointly created. We hope that our constitution will become the basis for the unity of all Italians, because we know that the constitution not only writes about the civil liberties that the foolish rulers intend to eliminate, and not only writes about the necessary social reforms. The constitution also writes that Italy refuses to use war as a political means and as a means of resolving any international disputes. This is the basis for the unity and peace that all Italian people yearn for.

　　From these positions, there arises a task currently facing the Italian Communist Party. At this time, the enemy can't wait for the communists to succumb to their provocations. If we agree with this instigation conspiracy, we will make a serious mistake. We must always remember a law: the more tense the situation, the more deeply we realize that we will face serious and arduous battles, the more we should maintain and expand our connections not only with the working class, but also with all the people (including that part of the people who until now did not know us, but now are more willing to know us than ever before, and realize that we have great power, and want to know our intentions).

　　Our intention is to defend peace by relying on the united action of the entire Italian people. Therefore, our task is to increasingly win the sympathy and trust of people of all classes to our side and to the side of our allies. This work is already underway. Our party is now a strong, active, and numerous party. I don't know in any way that there is any deviation or the slightest ambiguity in the position taken by our party's ranks and the ranks of our brother socialist party at this time. Our ranks are very tightly united.

　　The "independent" journalists and the newspapers of the ruling party have received instructions to clamor and fabricate divisions between us, and to fabricate the tendency to withdraw from the party that does not exist at all. Unfortunately, I can only disappoint them: all of this does not exist at all. There is only one difference in our party secretariat: how to treat MacArthur. However, this does not refer to the American general who is leading the aggression against Korea, but to the tomcat that is accustomed to curling up in the family of one of our leaders; this tomcat is so named because it is a fierce predator, greedily pouncing on every piece of meat. The point of difference is: some people advocate tying it up and throwing it to the ground—these people we call the "hardliners," while others suggest ignoring it—this is the so-called "softliners." Secondly, there is the "centrist faction," which advocates punishment, holding the cat by the tail.

　　The Power of Peace Has Surpassed the Power of War
　　Eagerly Hope that the Korean People Will Quickly Achieve Total Victory
　　On this issue, there is indeed a difference, as for another MacArthur, just like the Korean people treat him, we have not and cannot have any differences on this issue. We fully agree that the Korean people should give the American aggressors the lesson they deserve. On behalf of the working class and advanced Italian laborers, we fervently hope that the Korean people will quickly achieve total victory in their struggle for their unity and independence. The example of Korea gives an evidence to all those who do not yet believe in the power of the people, proving how great is the power of the people who are fighting for freedom.

　　No matter what problems arise as a result of the development of the situation in Italy and on the international stage, one undeniable and obvious conclusion is that the power of peace has now surpassed the power of war.

　　Not long ago, I had the opportunity to visit the German Democratic Republic while attending the Third Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party, and I deeply believe that great victories have been achieved in this part of Europe. This is an arduous undertaking. The German people have been deeply poisoned by fascism. It is not difficult to imagine the difficulties that a group of old communists who came out of concentration camps had to overcome, as they set about rebuilding the advanced party of the working class that could lead all the people to build a unified, independent, and democratic Germany. In the German Democratic Republic, there is now the advanced party of the working class, and the majority of the people are united around the party. Precisely because of this, in East Germany, where the cities and industrial centers were severely damaged during the war, the various sectors of the national economy have now reached pre-war production levels, and some sectors have even surpassed that level.

　　When I talked with the comrades of the German Socialist Unity Party, when I visited factories (where the German workers welcomed me like they were welcoming brothers of labor and struggle), I truly felt that a new, unified Europe had been born. However, this is not the so-called Europe of Europeans of all kinds in our government parties' ranks. This is the real Europe, stretching from the Urals to the Atlantic, where European peoples yearning for peace and cooperation live—from Russians to French, Czechs, and Italians. Between the people who have established a new system and that part of the advanced people who have not yet reached this point, unity has been achieved in the struggle to defend peace, strive for democracy, and strive to build a new world.

### 目前国际形势与意大利的民族利益

　　目前国际形势与意大利的民族利益
    意大利共产党总书记  托里亚蒂
    美帝发动侵朝战争以后
    意政治危机因素日益成熟
    由于朝鲜发生的事件的结果，意大利严重的政治危机的因素，已日益成熟而且愈益明显了。
    还在朝鲜事件发生以前，意大利现政府的情况就已不稳。只要回忆一下某些事例就够了，例如在最迫切的经济和政治问题上的争论，政府阵营和执政党中在每一步骤上发生的分歧，曾经轰动而且迄今仍然轰动舆论的流传各地的丑闻等。有人竟无耻地认为，朝鲜事件的发展会对政府有利。从外表看来，好像事实真是那样似的。在肆无忌惮的反共运动和加紧军事准备的旗帜下，基督教民主党与其卫星党派之间的某些分歧似乎已搁置一旁了。可是，所有这一切只是外表，而不是我国政治生活的本质。恰恰相反，我们国家和我国人民被拖入了或正被拖入比以前更加暖昧不明的情势中，因为惊慌又加上了困惑，除了由政府的行为所引起的惊慌之外，又加上了对将来的忧虑，所有这一切都日益有力地动摇着基督教民主党政权的基础。
    正因为如此，加斯贝利就可能宣称：朝鲜事件乃是意大利现势中最重要的因素。就某种意义来说，他是对的，因为由于意大利政府对于这一事件的态度，已把决定人民生活及其未来的问题——战争与和平问题——提到议事日程上。在这种事件的影响下，深刻的矛盾比以前大大加快成熟起来，而意大利政府也较前更加鲜明地显示出它不是意大利所需要的那种政府。它已显示自己不能了解日益复杂的国际和国内形势，暴露了自己不能坚持保护民族利益的路线，而这路线却是那种不愧称为政府的政府所应该执行的。加斯贝利政府暴露了一种罪恶的意图，要把意大利引上冒险的道路，法西斯主义就曾经一度循着这种冒险的道路把意大利引向灾难。加斯贝利政府代表外国帝国主义的利益所接受的国际义务，以及煽动思想意识上的盲从和战争歇斯底里，都可以证明这点。
    随着朝鲜事件的发展，这点对于意大利压倒多数的人民就愈来愈明显了。
    反对美国侵略中朝，主张亚洲人民自由
    我们对于朝鲜事件的看法，无需在此重复。我认为这种看法已为大多数头脑清醒的正直的人们所共知和了解。我所讲的只限于这样两个基本问题：
    一、美国公开进攻亚洲人民，是由于美国帝国主义企图对英勇的中国人民于过去的年月中在自己的共产党领导下使他们遭受的可耻失败进行报复。
    美国帝国主义者为了保持和扩大对亚洲人民的压迫和剥削，尽管自己在反中国人民的斗争中遭受失败，仍然进行新的侵略，企图侵犯中国人民及其他亚洲人民实现其自由、独立、统一的权利，侵犯他们建立符合其愿望、习惯、利益的内部生活的权利，侵犯他们不让外国帝国主义干涉自己内政的权利。这是朝鲜事件的第一方面。
    二、朝鲜事件的第二方面——在今天可能还不太明显，但却较第一方面更为严重——就是美国政策领导者企图把反苏“冷战”转为“热战”，把所谓西方及全世界投入新的毁灭性战争中。
    任何一个头脑清醒的正直的意大利人，都不会认为我们意大利人在美国帝国主义为了确立自己殖民统治而发动反对朝鲜和中国人民的战争时，会在任何程度上愿意美国帝国主义在亚洲大陆重新巩固起来。任何一个头脑清醒的正直的意大利人，都不会认为意大利会在任何程度上愿意美国借武装干涉所进行的帝国主义和殖民扩张能获得成功。我们是这样的一个国家，它屡屡由于自己统治者的意志而参加和帝国主义大强盗的竞争，但这种冲突的结果总是使它土崩瓦解。我们意大利人，只愿意远东人民脱出外国帝国主义的羁绊，使他们依照他们的愿望而开放他们的市场和我国通商，使世界上这一地区的美国及其他帝国主义垄断资本消灭，使我国能够从这种通商中获得利益。我们的志愿就是这样。我们决不愿朝鲜人民失败，决不愿中国被美国帝国主义者投入新的毁灭性战争中。
    意国决不能追随美国的反苏冒险
    真正的利益是与中国和苏联友好
    至于说到美国外交政策领导者为了巩固和加强西方国家反苏集团而使新战争爆发的日益增长的努力，我们除了对社会主义和人民民主国家表示毫不隐蔽的同情之外，我们更认为把意大利硬推出来反对人民民主国家、反对人民中国、反对苏联，是丝毫不符合民族利益的。恰恰相反，我们从客观出发，乐于和这些国家保持友好关系，使我们能和它们交换货物，扩大和它们之间的商业。我们的利益就是这样，也只有这样。
    有些人说：为了阻止共产主义学说流传，阻止关于社会主义及人民民主政体的真相流传，应该进行战争。我以为这也不是意大利国家的利益。不错，意大利内部有一个“强国”，其全部活动，如人们所说，依照“思想的动机”来讲，是保护一种见解而消灭另一种学说。可是，这“强国”不是意大利国家，而是梵蒂冈——罗马教皇的国度。我且假定罗马教皇为了非难这种学说和这种社会形式，认为必要采取措施，以阻止社会主义的传播。然而这又与意大利国家有什么关系呢？如果在许多地方对社会主义采取轻率政策（这使他自己的天主教会受害）的教皇，认为为了阻止他不同意的学说和社会制度的传播，也应该进行战争；那末，他岂不是成为甚至拥有自己军队的国家的首领了么？让他对苏联宣战，对人民民主国家宣战，对毛泽东的中国宣战吧！让他动员自己的瑞士近卫兵，使他们穿起漂亮的制服来进军（我们的拉非尔就曾画过他们），让他把天主教僧侣、修道士、或“天主教行动党”的领导人编成团队，送他们去作战吧！可是这与意大利国家全然无关；意大利国家完全不乐意这样做。意大利国家，如果它拥有对民族有责任感而且关心意大利人民的生活和存在的统治者，就无论如何都不应该进行军事冒险。
    加斯贝利政府禁止公开谈论朝鲜
    因为他的论据经不起人民的一击
    所以，无论是使我国在远东支持美国，还是使我国追随美国的反苏冒险，都完全不可能符合民族利益。可是意大利政府的全部活动却正与它所应该做的相反。美国刚开始侵略朝鲜，意大利统治者便像看到信号一样，受到鼓舞，成为他们法西斯前辈（这些人曾在长久的岁月中把意大利置于准备战争、实行战争、并在战争中失败的梦魇中）的思想和图谋的倡导者。现在意大利政府所采取的措施中，有的已为人所共知。譬如为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名的运动就被禁止了。这种禁止不能不认为是愚蠢而可笑的。意大利存在着拥有数百万党员的共产党和社会党，存在着由八九百万民主的选民所组成的阵线，在这种情形下，还能真正相信这种禁止会生效么？城乡居民在要求禁止原子武器中表现出来的意志，比政治上的表现更为伟大。这是成百万人愿意保护自己的家园和自己的生命的情绪的表现。
    我们的反对者说：征集签名毫无用处。这是不对的。因为当大家都知道世界上签名的几万万男女不仅是考虑到自己的命运，而且也考虑到全人类的命运时，就意味着人类在为拯救和平而进行的斗争中向前迈进了一大步。
    意大利政府禁止在街上谈论朝鲜。在意大利只有在秘密场所才能谈朝鲜。在街上只可谈那位声明朝鲜事件是我国局势最重要因素的加斯贝利。我们的组织在秘密场所召开了成千成万次集会，在那里曾向几百万人说明美国侵略朝鲜的意义，说明关于意大利同情这种侵略的声明是加斯贝利政府多么荒唐的举动。
    禁止公开谈论朝鲜究竟表示什么意义呢？这表示：加斯贝利先生、史佛卓先生、执政的基督教民主党领导人、“天主教行动党”以及附庸小党派的首领都认识到：在广场上，在人民面前，他们的论据经不起我们的论据一击。因此，他们企图塞住我们的口。可是，大家都知道：墨索里尼也以为可以塞住我们的口，也相信他能取得胜利，然而墨索里尼却只有使国家走向灾难。今天我们应该防止灾难。
    苏联人民民主国家力量强大
    谁敢动手反对谁就纵火自焚
    再者，大家也都知道，他们还企图把一切与现在统治者见解不同的人们都宣布为“第五纵队”。硬说相当大的一部分意大利人民，在下院拥有三分之一的议员，以及在上院差不多占半数席位的政党是“第五纵队”——这真是在政治上绝顶的愚昧无知。把我们叫做“第五纵队”，是因为我们不愿意大利加入反苏阵线，不愿意大利被拖上反苏战争的道路。完全正确：我们无论如何也不愿我国参加反苏集团。我们将竭尽全力，反对我国卷入反苏反人民民主国家的战争。
    为什么我们采取这样的立场呢？首先是因为：我们也和一切人民一样，从苏联看到在斗争和劳动中获得的进步和新式的文明。唆使意大利反对这民主、进步、爱好和平的国家的企图，乃是我们所应该防止的罪恶。
    但另一原因对大家也应该是显而易见的。我们不愿意大利参加反苏阵线和被拖入目前正在准备的战争，是因为我们不愿意大利遭受失败。让我们的反对者设法严重地对待这件事吧。墨索里尼的“八百万大军”和巴齐亚地的“四十个师”——这是过去已经被历史揭露而且将来还要被历史揭露的自吹自擂。从欧洲的心脏直到亚洲东部边界的社会主义国家与人民民主国家，它们的力量不仅在于它们工业上、农业上、政治上的威力，而且首先在于这些团结起来奋发鼓舞的人民在精神方面的优越性，它们认识到它们正在为创造新世界的事业而努力，明天它们也能为保卫高度的文明幸福而作战。这种力量是不可战胜的。我们要防止意大利遭受新的失败，防止新的毁灭，防止重蹈以远征军出国而以战俘归国的覆辙。让大家知道：谁动手反对人民，谁就是纵火自焚。
    或许有人要反驳我们，说我们过早地讨论了这个问题。我们不想和他争论。重要的是：我们要求我们政治上的反对者，要求意大利政府的总理，要求外交部长，要求组成联合政府的政党领导人回答这个问题：苏联什么时候容许过威胁意大利国家的行动，从而使意大利国家明天必须投入反苏反人民民主国家的战争？请指出这种行动来。这一个问题过去得不到回答，将来也永远得不到回答。实际上，这种行动是不存在的。自世界上有苏联以来，这种行动从未存在过。再回溯一下，可以说甚至连旧俄也从未对意大利采取过使意大利国家需要自卫的立场。当墨索里尼把意大利投入反苏战争时，除了“天主教行动党”的思想家以外，他的唯一论据便是一项断言，硬说必须追随希特勒；这就意味着走向失败，走向全军覆没，走向几百万意大利人的灭亡。我们的反对者无法回答这一问题，这就是说：连他们自己都承认，他们对苏联和人民民主国家的图谋，乃是美英帝国主义——世界上仅存的最反动的力量所指使的侵略图谋。
    意政府为美国军队的入侵打开大门
    意人民决心赶出强盗不作战争工具
    有人控诉我们，说我们意大利共产党人在战争时候甘愿为外国军队打开我国的大门。实际上完全不是这样。谁为外国列强打开我国大门并让他们在我国建筑他们自己的军事基地呢？这就是意大利政府，它签订了大西洋公约并缔结了甚至它自己都耻于承认的军事协定。
    我们要求政府公开向意大利人民郑重保证：他们没有接受任何那样的义务，由于这种义务，不论远东或欧洲的情势会怎样发展，美国军队都可以进入我们的领土，派军舰到我们的港口，派飞机到我们的机场，用这种方式或其他方式把意大利变为自己军事行动的基地。我们要求政府这样作，我们声明如果作出这种保证，就会大大有助于松弛国内的紧张状态。可是直到现在为止，却没有这样的保证，而且我们知道它是不会作这种保证的。意大利人民的责任，就是决心赶出我们的统治者为他打开我国大门的外国强盗。
    我们要求，再一次要求意大利政府保证：政府不作丝毫足以把意大利变为基地或为外人利益充当战争工具的行动。我们要求保证政府决意放弃已准备好要这样作的行动，我们告诉政府：只有这样才能松弛国内形势紧张的程度。
    他们以非常措施来威胁我们。我们对这已是司空见惯了。意大利资产阶级总是准备插足战争的，他们看到已经历两次战争的人民对他们罪恶计划的反抗日益成熟，便想采取非常措施。意大利司法部长曾作出这样一个真正使人触目惊心的司法上的发现：他发明了预行逮捕令。大家知道：逮捕令，这是在谁犯了罪时所发布的一种公文。可是我们的司法部长已经知道谁将来要犯罪，便预先准备好对这些人的逮捕令！
    国防部长巴齐亚地叫嚣赢得战争
    他不过是咀嚼墨索里尼唾余而已
    国防部长巴齐亚地不久以前的声明也值得注意。他宣布了他自己的意图，是要清算（在政府决定作这件事的情势已成熟时）约四百个意大利公民。同时国防部长已“剥夺了”这些意大利人的我国公民权。应该极严重地看待这个声明，首先是因为这个人是意大利军事特务机关的领导人，这个机关早在法西斯时代就曾参加杀害反法西斯的罗塞尔兄弟。如果我们回忆这种杀害而把它与巴齐亚地不久以前的声明对照一下，那末，七月十四日（一九四八年七月十四日是谋刺托里亚蒂同志的日子——编者）的事件，就显出特殊的意义。
    可是，巴齐亚地的声明并没有任何新奇独创的东西。在意大利，这个已剥夺了一批意大利公民的国籍的人宣称：必须消灭几百个“密谋者”，那时一切都将顺利，而他便会赢得战争。可怜的巴齐亚地只能咀嚼墨索里尼的唾余。
    大家都知道，马克思曾写道：某些事件和个人在历史上会出现两回，可是第一回是以悲剧姿态出现，第二回则以笑剧姿态出现。在这场合我们所遇到的是笑剧。而且，我以为，归根到底，墨索里尼虽然对意大利犯了许多罪，本质上却是个小丑。巴齐亚地则是模仿小丑的小丑和没有头脑的吹嘘者。
    由于我们的统治者对朝鲜采取荒唐政策的结果，已造成意大利如此严重的局势，以至在渴望和平与统一的我国中，备战和内战的空气越来越浓厚了。在中间阶层中可以看出深深的惶惑，而在某些阶层中则甚至惊慌。所有这一切都要归罪于政府，归罪于它那与意大利的利益毫无共同之处的政策。
    意共号召人民为和平及统一而奋斗
    当前任务为扩大及保持与人民团结
    在这种局势下，我们再一次宣布我们是为了什么而奋斗，我们是向意大利人民发出怎样的号召。我们奋斗是为了使我们国家保持和平，不参加任何冒险，这种冒险加深欧洲和全世界的分裂，这种冒险导向互相挑衅，这种冒险鼓励美国帝国主义对亚洲人民进攻，并且可能使我国卷入不幸的冲突中，这种冲突将使我国不可避免地被压碎。
    我们是为和平及为意大利人的统一而奋斗，因而我们不仅号召工人，号召先进农民和其他先进力量，而且也号召中层以及富有阶层的居民。我们告诉全体意大利人：你们要戒备、要警惕，你们问一问自己的良心：只是因为有了因自己的狂乱而梦想思想战争和宗教战争的“天主教行动党”领导人，只是因为有了这样一些统治者，他们借助于外国帝国主义获得政权后便自以为现在有权用和平的代价，用意大利人的血的代价来偿付自己个人的债，就使意大利采取了悲惨的步骤，这是正当的吗？
    我们的这一号召将要得到响应。我们并不期望全体中层大众都转到我们这方面来，但我们期望他们考虑和相信我们对人民的呼声——这理智与警告的呼声——是和平和统一的呼声。
    在已经严阵对垒的如此紧张斗争的情况下，统一的基础在那里呢？这种基础奠定在我们共同创立的宪法上。我们希望我们的宪法成为全体意大利人统一的基础，因为我们知道：宪法上不仅写着愚蠢的统治者打算消灭的公民自由，不仅写着必要的社会改革。宪法上还写着意大利拒绝把战争作为政治手段以及解决任何国际纷争的手段。这就是全意大利人民所渴望的统一与和平的基础。
    从我们这些立场出发，就产生了目前在意大利共产党面前提出的一个任务。这时敌人巴不得共产党人在他们的挑衅面前屈服。如果我们赞同这种挑拨阴谋，我们就犯了严重的错误。必须永远记住一条定律：局势愈紧张，我们愈深刻地认识到我们将面临严重而艰巨的战斗，我们就愈应该保持和扩大我们不仅与工人阶级，而且也与一切人民（包括迄今以前还不知道我们，但现在却比任何时候更愿意认识我们，而且意识到我们有巨大力量，想知道我们的意图的那部分人民）的联系。
    我们的意图是：依靠全意大利人民的统一行动，来捍卫和平。因此，我们的任务便是越来越多地把各阶层人民的同情和信赖，争取到我们这一边和我们的同盟者这一边来。这工作已经在进行了。我们的党现在已是强大、活跃、人数众多的党。我无论如何也不知道我们党的队伍和兄弟的社会党队伍此时所采取的立场，有任何的偏差或丝毫的含糊。我们的队伍是团结得十分紧密的。
    “独立的”记者和执政党的报纸都接到了训令，要鼓噪叫嚣，臆造我们之间发生分歧，捏造那绝不存在的退党倾向。可惜，我只有使他们失望：所有这一切完全不存在。在我们党的书记处只有一点歧异：即如何对待麦克阿瑟。可是，这里所指的并不是领导侵略朝鲜的美国将军，而是指习惯于蜷缩在我们领导者之一的家庭中的那只雄猫；这只雄猫之所以如此命名，是因为它是凶猛的掠夺者，贪婪地向每块肉飞扑过去。歧异之点在于：一些人主张把它捆起来摔到地上去——这些人我们叫做“硬派”，而另一些人建议对它置之不理——这就是所谓“软派”。其次，还有“中派”，主张惩罚，拖住猫尾巴。
    和平的力量已经超过战争的力量
    热望朝鲜人民迅速获得全面胜利
    在这个问题上，分歧的确是有的，至于对另一个麦克阿瑟，就如朝鲜人民对待他的那样，在这个问题上我们便没有而且也不可能有分歧。我们完全同意朝鲜人民应该予美国侵略者以应有的教训。我们代表工人阶级和先进的意大利劳动者，热烈盼望朝鲜人民在争取自己统一和独立的斗争中迅速获得全面胜利。朝鲜的例子给予一切还不相信人民的力量的人们一个证据，证明争取自由的人民的力量是多么伟大。
    不论在意大利以及在国际舞台上情势发展的结果产生什么问题，无可争辩的显而易见的一个结论是：和平的力量现在已经超过了战争的力量。
    不久以前，我在参加德国统一社会党第三次代表大会时曾有机会访问德意志民主共和国，我深深相信在欧洲的这部分已达到巨大的胜利。这是艰巨的事业。德国人民受法西斯主义毒害甚深。不难想像从集中营出来的一批老共产党人所不得不克服的那种困难，他们要着手重建能够引导全体人民去建立统一、独立、民主德国的工人阶级的先进的党。在德意志民主共和国，现在有工人阶级的先进的党，以及团结在党周围的大多数人民。正因为如此，所以在东德，那儿的城市和工业中心在战时虽曾遭受巨大破坏，而现在国民经济各部门则已达到战前生产水准，并且某些部门甚至已经超过了那个水准。
    当我和德国统一社会党的同志们交谈时，当我访问工厂（那儿的德国工人像欢迎劳动和斗争的兄弟一样欢迎我）时，我真正感觉到统一的新欧洲已经诞生了。可是，这并不是在我们政府党的队伍中所有的那种所谓欧洲人的欧洲。这是真正的欧洲，从乌拉尔伸展到大西洋，在这里居住着渴望和平和合作的欧洲人民——从俄罗斯人到法兰西人、捷克人、意大利人。在已建立新制度的人民与尚未达到这一地步的那部分先进人民之间，在捍卫和平、争取民主、争取建立新世界的斗争中，团结和统一已经实现了。（译自一九五○年八月份《布尔什维克》杂志）（新华社讯。文中小题为本报编者加的。）
