　　Commemorative Remarks on the Eleventh Anniversary of Bethune's Death
　　"Learn from His Internationalist Spirit, Aid Korea, and Defend the Motherland"
　　Wang Yueshu
　　The great internationalist Dr. Bethune came from faraway Canada to work in China precisely when the Japanese imperialists' butcher knives were pointed at the Chinese people. Dr. Bethune loved the righteous people and joined the Chinese people in resisting imperialist aggression. He contributed all his energy and his life. In the eleven years since his death, the Chinese people have finally overthrown Japanese imperialism, overthrown the Chiang Kai-shek bandits who were fully supported by U.S. imperialism, and built their own new country. On this day, the eleventh anniversary of Dr. Bethune's death, when people all over the world are filled with intense hatred for the aggressors, U.S. imperialism is following the despicable old path of Japanese imperialism, placing its butcher knives on the heads of the people of Korea, China, Asia, and the whole world. Here, Dr. Bethune's example of internationalism inspires us. We must, as he said, "use all our blood and work" to oppose aggression!
　　Currently, U.S. imperialism is carrying out a bloody massacre in Korea, slaughtering the Korean people. We, the Chinese people, absolutely cannot sit idly by.
　　Dr. Bethune once used his "blood and work" to aid the Chinese people's cause of liberation. The Chinese people must also use their "blood and work" to aid the Korean people's liberation.
　　Everyone knows that U.S. imperialism's armed aggression against Korea is only one step in its aggression against the whole world. Therefore, our aid to the Korean people in fighting the enemy is also an important step in defending world peace.
　　The great internationalist Dr. Bethune, he contributed his skills and life to resist aggression. We must learn from Dr. Bethune's spirit of joining the Canadian volunteers in 1936 to go to Spain to do relief work (note), using volunteer action to support the Korean brothers who once fought alongside us. Although we cannot all go to Korea to fight the enemy with bayonets, we can use diligent and intense work to resist U.S. imperialism's aggression from various work positions.
　　To commemorate Dr. Bethune, we must learn from his example, aid Korea! Defend the Motherland! Defend world peace.
　　Note: Dr. Bethune was Canadian. At the age of twenty-five, he served on the European battlefield during World War I. In 1936, when the German and Italian fascist bandits invaded Spain, the Canadian people organized a volunteer army—the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion—to aid the Spanish people. Dr. Bethune served as the captain of the battalion's medical team. Later, he joined the Fifteenth Brigade, which was composed of British, American, Canadian, and South American nationalities, and personally went to the front lines to rescue the wounded. He also established a blood transfusion program for the wounded in Spain. When the Chinese people were fighting the War of Resistance Against Japan, he led a medical team to China.

　　白求恩逝世十一周年纪念感言
    “要学习他的国际主义精神，援助朝鲜，保卫祖国”
　　王约书
    伟大的国际主义者白求恩大夫，当他从辽远的加拿大来到中国工作的时候，正是日本帝国主义的屠刀杀向中国人民头上的时候。白求恩大夫热爱着正义的人民，和中国人民一道去反抗帝国主义的侵略。他贡献出自己全部的精力和自己的生命。在他逝世后的十一年中，中国人民终于打倒了日本帝国主义，打倒了美帝全力支持的蒋匪，建造出自己的新的国家。而当白大夫逝世十一周年纪念的今日，当全世界人民，对侵略者强烈愤恨的今日，美帝国主义却走着日本帝国主义的卑鄙的老路，把屠刀加在朝鲜、中国、亚洲，以及全世界人民的头上。这儿，白大夫国际主义的榜样鼓舞着我们，我们要如他说的话那样：“用所有我们的血和工作”去反对侵略！
    目前美帝正在朝鲜进行着血腥的屠杀，屠杀着朝鲜的人民。我们中国人民是绝对不能坐视的。
    白求恩大夫曾经用自己的“血和工作”援助了中国人民的解放事业，中国人民也要用自己的“血和工作”援助朝鲜人民的解放。
    谁都知道，美帝的武装侵略朝鲜，仅仅是侵略全世界的一个步骤。因此我们援助朝鲜人民去和敌人搏斗也是保卫世界和平的一个重要步骤。
    伟大的国际主义者白求恩大夫，他贡献了他的技术和生命去反抗侵略，我们要学习白求恩大夫在一九三六年随加拿大志愿军到西班牙去作救护工作的精神（注），用志愿行动来支援曾经和我们并肩作战的朝鲜弟兄。我们虽不能全部到朝鲜去和敌人拚刺刀，但我们可以用勤劳和紧张的工作，从各个不同的工作岗位上去反抗美帝的侵略。
    纪念白求恩大夫，要学习他的榜样，援助朝鲜！保卫祖国！保卫世界和平。
    注：白求恩大夫是加拿大人，二十五岁时，即在第一次世界大战的欧洲战场上服务。一九三六年德意法西斯匪徒侵略西班牙，加拿大人民组织了志愿军——麦克拍伯营去援助西班牙人民。白求恩大夫担任这个营的卫生队队长。后来又参加了由英、美、加、南美各民族编成的第十五纵队，亲自上火线去救护伤兵。并建立了西班牙伤兵的输血工作。中国人民进行抗日战争，他率领了一个医疗队来到了中国。
