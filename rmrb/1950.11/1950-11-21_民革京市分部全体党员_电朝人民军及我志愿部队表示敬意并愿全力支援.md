The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Beijing Municipal Branch, Sends a Telegram to the Korean People's Army and Our Volunteer Army Expressing Respect and Willingness to Provide Full Support

[Reported by this newspaper] The entire membership of the Beijing Municipal Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang met on the 19th and passed a telegram of respect to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Volunteer Army, expressing their willingness to do everything possible to support them in eliminating the American invading army. The telegram reads as follows:

To the Comrades of the Korean People's Army:

It has been more than four months since American imperialism invaded you. The American imperialists and their running dogs were almost driven into the sea by you. Although the American imperialists have frantically expanded their aggression, they have suffered significant losses each time due to your heroic resistance. Now our Volunteer Army is fighting side by side with you, giving the enemy a severe blow. We deeply admire your great and heroic battles for your country and for peace. We are willing to do everything in our power to support you, quickly eliminate the enemy, and achieve final victory. We extend our highest respect to you!

The entire membership of the Beijing Municipal Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, respectfully.

November 19th

To the Comrades of the Chinese People's Anti-American and Aid-Korea Volunteer Army:

Your practical actions to resist America, aid Korea, defend our homes, and protect our country fully demonstrate that the Chinese people today not only possess a high degree of new patriotism but also a high degree of internationalism. For the sake of Korea, for the sake of Asia, for the sake of world peace, and naturally for our own sake, we will not allow imperialists to wantonly carry out aggression. Only by rising up together can we give the warmongers a head-on blow. You are braving the hardships and dangers in the freezing weather, fighting heroically alongside the fraternal Korean People's Army to combat American imperialism, causing them to flee in panic and daring not to advance wildly north. We are filled with boundless admiration for your great and glorious victory and extend to you our highest revolutionary respect! We are determined to support your heroic advance with every possible means, quickly clear away the remnants of American imperialism, and liberate all of Korea.

The entire membership of the Beijing Municipal Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, respectfully.

November 19th

    自从美帝国主义侵略你们以来，已经四个多月了，美帝和他的走狗，曾被你们几乎打下海去，后来美帝虽然疯狂地扩大了侵略，但是每次都由于你们的英勇抵抗，使他们有了重大的牺牲。现在我们志愿军正在和你们并肩作战，又给敌人以严重的打击，你们这样为祖国为和平伟大的英勇战斗，使我们非常敬佩。我们愿尽一切的力量，来支援你们，迅速消灭敌人，取得最后胜利。谨向你们致崇高的敬礼！
