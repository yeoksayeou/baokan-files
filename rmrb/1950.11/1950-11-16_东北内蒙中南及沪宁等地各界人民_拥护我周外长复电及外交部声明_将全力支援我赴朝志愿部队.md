Xinhua News Agency, November 13th and 14th: People from all walks of life in various provinces and cities in Northeast China (Heilongjiang, Liaodong, Liaoxi), Inner Mongolia, Shanghai, Nanjing, Shandong, and Central South China warmly support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's November 11th reply telegram to Trygve Lie and the statement by the spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the same day condemning MacArthur's "report" and Austin's statement. They also expressed their determination to further develop the just movement of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country, and to fully support our righteous volunteer troops going to Korea.

Heilongjiang

The Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Democratic Women's Federation, the Student Federation, the Federation of Literary and Art Workers, the branch of the Chinese People's Committee Against American Aggression on Taiwan and Korea, and the branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association issued a joint statement saying: "The Chinese people, driven by righteous indignation, volunteer to aid the Korean people, resist American aggression, protect our homes, and defend our country. This is a completely reasonable and just action, and we must not allow American aggressors to distort right and wrong and wantonly slander us." The statement expressed firm support for the propositions put forward in the November 11th statement by the spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs: "The invading troops of American aggressors and their accomplices in Korea should all be withdrawn from Korea, and the Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people themselves."

Liaodong

The Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, and various women's and literary and artistic circles jointly issued a statement on the 12th, saying: "Liaodong Province is only separated from Korea by a river. The facts we, the people of Liaodong, have witnessed clearly show us that the purpose of American aggression against Korea is not only to annex Korea, but mainly to expand its aggression against China. Our Chinese people volunteer to aid the Korean people, resist American aggression, and saving our neighbor is saving ourselves. The American aggressors' accusation that our people's just action of volunteering to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country is 'foreign intervention' is a complete distortion of the facts and nonsense."

Liaoxi

The Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Federation of Literary and Art Workers, the Democratic Women's Federation, the branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and the Jinzhou branch of the Chinese Committee for the Defense of World Peace also issued statements respectively, expressing that no matter what intimidation the American imperialists may use, the people from all walks of life in Liaoxi Province will resolutely fight to the end for resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country.

Inner Mongolia

More than 300 representatives from various people's organizations and all ethnic groups and all walks of life gathered on the 13th and unanimously expressed their firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou's telegram to the Security Council and the November 11th statement by the spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Speakers unanimously pointed out that the shameless lies of the war-monger MacArthur and Austin were completely distorted and purposeful nonsense, and that our people's volunteering to resist America and aid Korea is a completely reasonable and just act. A soldier from the Inner Mongolia Military Region, Aqi, said: "The Chinese people's volunteering to resist America and aid Korea is a completely reasonable and just act. When we Chinese resisted the aggressors, the Korean people fought alongside us. The blood of the Korean people has been shed on the land of our motherland. Now that we see our comrades being brutally trampled by the American imperialists, how can we stand idly by?" The meeting unanimously adopted a joint statement by various people's organizations in Inner Mongolia, solemnly declaring that the people of Inner Mongolia are willing to unite with all fraternal nationalities across the country and fight to the end for resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country.

Shanghai

The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Shanghai Branch of the China Democratic League, the Shanghai Branch of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, and the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party issued statements respectively, unanimously stating that the Chinese people will never retreat in the face of the American imperialists' threatening words, and that the people of the whole country must deeply develop the just struggle of volunteering to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, representing millions of workers, stated: "Shanghai workers vow to strengthen production and extensively carry out the movement of volunteering to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country to stop American aggression and defend world peace."

The joint statement issued by the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Democratic Youth Federation, and the Student Federation, as well as the statements issued by the Shanghai Municipal Democratic Women's Federation, the Shanghai Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, unanimously pointed out that Foreign Minister Zhou's reply telegram and the statement by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs represent the firm will of the people of the whole country.

Nanjing

The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Communist Youth League Committee, the Democratic Women's Federation, the Democratic Youth Federation, and the Student Federation and other organizations have issued statements, that the solemn statement of Foreign Minister Zhou and the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is what the people of Nanjing want to say. The Chinese people volunteer to aid the Korean people in resisting American aggression, which is a just act to protect the homeland and defend the country. The nonsense of the American war-mongers cannot deceive the people of the world, nor can they intimidate the Chinese people. Responsible persons of various democratic parties in Nanjing, such as the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang, the Democratic League, and the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, all said: The Chinese people must never tolerate the American imperialists manipulating the Security Council to do whatever they want, and resolutely deny the so-called "report" of the "United Nations Command" illegally produced under American manipulation.

Shandong

The Shandong Provincial Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Against American Aggression issued a statement saying: "The people of Shandong, who have been subjected to the harassment of American planes and warships, are vigorously carrying out the movement of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country. The slander, deception, and intimidation of American imperialism can only further arouse the rebellious anger of the people of Shandong. If American aggression does not stop, our Chinese people's struggle against aggression will never stop."

Central South China

The Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Trade Unions issued a written opinion on the 13th, saying: "All worker brothers in the Central South China region resolutely ignore any deception and intimidation from the American aggressors and continue to carry out the movement of volunteering to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country with practical actions of patriotic production competitions." The Central South China Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Preparatory Committee of the Central South China Democratic Women's Federation both expressed that the youth and women in the entire region will respond to the slander of the American aggressors with more extensive practical actions of volunteering to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. Various democratic parties and people's organizations in Wuhan and Hubei Province also stated: "The Chinese people volunteer to aid the Korean people in resisting American aggression, which is an irreproachable, reasonable, and just act, and it is absolutely not allowed for American war-mongers to slander at will."

Guangdong

Various people's organizations in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City have issued statements and written talks, unanimously denouncing the American imperialists for once again attempting to steal the name of the United Nations and further expand the aggressive war and openly invade our country. The written talk of the Guangdong Provincial Farmers Association said: "Any slander, deception, and intimidation of the Chinese people by American imperialism is despicable. Our farmers throughout the province resolutely support the Korean people's war of liberation with all our strength through voluntary actions."

Jiangxi

Local organizations of various democratic parties and people's organizations in Jiangxi Province have also issued written talks, unanimously supporting the November 11th telegram from Foreign Minister Zhou to the Security Council and the two statements issued by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
