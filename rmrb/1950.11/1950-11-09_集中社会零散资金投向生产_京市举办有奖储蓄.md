To concentrate scattered social funds into production, the Beijing Municipal People's Bank is holding "Principal-Protected, Value-Guaranteed Prize-Linked Term Savings" starting in October to promote thrift and encourage savings.

Holding prize-linked savings is based on the spirit of Article 37 of the Common Program, which states, "The People's Government should take necessary measures to encourage people's savings," and learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. The Soviet people believe that savings are a patriotic act, beneficial to national construction, and also beneficial to the people. State banks hold prize-linked savings to encourage this patriotic behavior in the form of material rewards. This is fundamentally different from the "lottery tickets" and "sweepstakes" issued in China during the period of reactionary rule, where the people's interests were plundered by the bureaucratic bourgeoisie.

The methods of prize-linked savings have the following characteristics: First, the savings amount is very low and the term is short. Each savings certificate is 10,000 yuan, with a term of six months. If you save this month, you don't have to save next month. It is flexible, so that people with weaker savings capacity can also participate in savings at any time, and those with greater savings capacity can save more. This method is very suitable for the needs of the broad masses of the people. Second, the prize pool is wide and the prize amount is moderate. Prizes are divided into six types, from the grand prize to the last prize and supplementary prize. There are 3,115 prizes for every 100,000 lottery tickets, with an average of one winning opportunity in every 32 tickets. The highest prize is 5 million yuan. If it is set higher, the savings interests of the masses would be too concentrated on one person. If it is set too low, the encouragement effect would not be great. Third, savings are based on the method of principal protection and value guarantee, calculated according to the real-value price quotation. At maturity in six months, the principal and interest are repaid, and depositors are not affected by price fluctuations.

The first phase of prize-linked savings was scheduled to begin on October 21st by the Municipal People's Bank, and will end on the 20th of this month. According to the regulations, the lottery will be drawn publicly at the end of the month.

The full text of the regulations for this principal-protected, value-guaranteed prize-linked term savings deposit is as follows:

Article 1: This deposit has a term of six months, starting from the 21st of the month following the start of each phase.

Article 2: Each phase of this deposit is in a group of 100,000 numbers, with each number being 10,000 yuan in RMB. It can be deposited in a lump sum at any time during the deposit period. The principal is guaranteed according to the face value of the deposit certificate and the value is guaranteed by converting it into real units according to the real-value price quotation on the deposit deadline (20th of each month).

Article 3: This deposit pays principal and interest in one lump sum upon maturity. If the price quotation falls, the principal and interest will be paid at 10,200 yuan calculated in the original currency. If the price quotation rises, the principal will be calculated according to the real-value price quotation on the maturity date, and the interest will still be paid according to the original currency amount. (Interest income tax is borne by the bank.)

Article 4: A lottery will be drawn for this deposit in each phase, and will be held publicly at the end of the month following the start of each phase (the location of the lottery will be announced separately), and representatives from the government, relevant authorities, and depositors will be invited to supervise the process. The lottery results will be broadcast on the radio on the same day and announced in the newspaper within three days.

Article 5: The lottery method for this deposit is to draw numbers by lottery. If the numbers for the first, second, and third prizes are not in the savings, they will be re-drawn.

Article 6: The prize money distribution for each group is as follows:

	One first prize: Sole winner receives 5 million yuan.
	Two second prizes: Each receives 1 million yuan.
	Ten third prizes: Each receives 500,000 yuan.
	One hundred fourth prizes (last three digits are the same): Each receives 100,000 yuan.
	Three thousand consolation prizes (last two digits are the same): Each receives 10,000 yuan.
	Two supplementary prizes (numbers immediately above and below the first prize): Each receives 500,000 yuan.

Those who win the first, second, third, and supplementary prizes can also win the fourth or consolation prize. Those who win the fourth prize can also win the consolation prize.

Article 7: If the number of numbers actually issued in each month is less than a complete group (i.e., 100,000 numbers), the number of winners and the amount of prize money will be reduced in proportion to the number of numbers actually issued in that group, as follows:

	1. The number of winners for the first, second, third, and supplementary prizes remains unchanged, and the amount of prize money is reduced proportionally.
	2. The amount of prize money for the fourth and consolation prizes remains unchanged, and the number of winners is reduced proportionally.

The number of numbers actually issued each month will be announced in the newspaper one day before the lottery is drawn.

Article 8: The prize money for this deposit can be claimed by depositors holding deposit certificates five days after the lottery is drawn. In addition to the first, second, third, and supplementary prizes, which must be redeemed at the Savings Department of the People's Bank of Beijing Branch, all other prizes can be redeemed at the various handling departments and offices, which will issue a "Winning Deposit Certificate for Principal and Interest" for claiming principal and interest upon maturity. The income tax on this prize money is borne by the bank. If the prize money is not claimed within six months from the date of the lottery, it will be considered forfeited.

Article 9: The deposit certificate for this deposit is not registered, and cannot be reported lost, or withdrawn or mortgaged for loans before maturity.

Article 10: If the deposit certificate number for this deposit is altered, defaced, or unclear, it will be invalidated and payment will be stopped.

Article 11: Matters not covered in these regulations shall be handled in accordance with the savings deposit regulations of this bank.

### 集中社会零散资金投向生产  京市举办有奖储蓄

　　集中社会零散资金投向生产
    京市举办有奖储蓄
    京市人民银行为了提倡节约，鼓励储蓄，集中社会上零散的资金投向生产建设，从十月份起即举办“保本保值有奖定期储蓄存款”。
    举办有奖储蓄是根据共同纲领第三十七条“人民政府应采取必要的办法，鼓励人民储蓄”的精神及学习苏联的先进经验。苏联人民认为储蓄是一种爱国行为，有功于国家的建设，也有利于人民，国家银行举办有奖储蓄，就是以物质奖励的形式鼓励这种爱国行为。这和中国过去在反动统治时期发行的“奖券”、“彩票”，结果人民的利益被官僚资产阶级掠夺，有着本质上的不同。
    有奖储蓄的办法有下面几个特点：第一、储蓄额定得很低，期限短。储蓄券每张一万元，期限半年，如果这个月储蓄了下个月也可以不储蓄，是灵活的，使储蓄能力较薄弱的人也可以随时参加储蓄，储蓄能力较大的可以多储蓄，这样的办法很符合目前广大人民群众的需要。第二、奖面宽、奖额适度。奖金自头奖到末奖、附奖共分六种，每十万张奖券中有三千一百十五个奖，平均三十二张中就有一个获奖机会。奖金最高是五百万元，如定得再高，即是把群众储蓄利益太集中一个人，定得太低，鼓励作用就不大。第三、储蓄按保本保值的办法，以折实牌价计算，半年到期还本付息，存户不受物价涨落的影响。
    第一期的有奖储蓄，市人民银行定于十月二十一日即开始收储，本月二十日截止，按着章程规定，于月底公开开奖。
    此项保本保值有奖定期储蓄存款章程全文如下：
    第一条：本存款定期六个月，自每期开办之次月二十一日起算。
    第二条：本存款每期以十万号为一组，每号为人民币一万元，于收储期内随时一次存入，按存单面额保本，照收储截止日（每月二十日）折实牌价折成实物单位保值。
    第三条：本存款于到期时一次支付本息，牌价下落按原存货币计算付给本息一万零二百元；如牌价上升本金按到期日折实牌价计算，利息仍照原定货币数付给。（利息所得税由银行负担缴付）
    第四条：本存款每期开奖一次，于每期开办之次月月底公开举行（开奖地点另行公布），并邀请政府与有关机关及储户代表到场监视。开奖结果，除当日由电台广播外，并于三日内登报公告之。
    第五条：本存款开奖方法采取摇奖对号方式，其摇出之头、二、三奖号码，如未收储，另行重摇。
    第六条：本存款每组奖金分配如下：
    头奖一个  独得奖金五百万元。
    二奖二个  各得奖金一百万元。
    三奖十个  各得奖金五十万元。
    四奖一百个（末尾三字相同）各得奖金一十万元。
    末奖三千个（末尾二字相同）各得奖金一万元。
    附奖二个（与头奖上下联号）各得奖金五十万元。
    凡中头、二、三及附奖者，可兼得肆奖或末奖奖金，中肆奖者，可兼得末奖奖金。
    第七条：前条奖金分配，如遇未储满一个组时（即十万号），中奖个数与得奖金额照该组实际发出号数比例减少如左：
    １．头、二、三奖及附奖中奖个数不变，得奖金额比例减少。
    ２．肆奖及末奖得奖金额不变，中奖个数比例减少。
    每月实际发出号数于开奖前一天登报公告。
    第八条：本存款奖金于开奖五天后，由储户持存单领取，除头、二、三及附奖必须向人民银行北京分行储蓄部兑取外，其余各奖可向各经办部、处兑取之，由兑付行处换发“中奖存单支取本息凭证”俟到期时领取本息，该项奖金所得税由银行负担缴付。自开奖之日起，逾六个月不来领取奖金者，作放弃论。
    第九条：本存款存单不记名，并不得挂失，未到期前不得支取或抵押借款。
    第十条：本存款存单号码，如有涂改、污损、不清等情形，一律作废止付。
    第十一条：本章程未尽事宜，依照本行储蓄存款章程办理。
