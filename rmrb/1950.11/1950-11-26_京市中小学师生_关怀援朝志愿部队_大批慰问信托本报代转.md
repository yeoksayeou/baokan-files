　　Beijing Middle and Primary School Teachers and Students
    Show Concern for the Volunteer Army to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea
    A Large Number of Letters of Condolence Entrusted to This Newspaper for Forwarding
    [This Newspaper] Since our Volunteer Army to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and the Korean People's Army fought side by side and reported victories, this newspaper has received many letters of condolence from all sides every day, entrusting us to forward them to the officers and soldiers at the front in Korea. Recently, the most letters have come from schools in Beijing, with thousands of letters conveying a common voice, expressing great excitement and concern for the victory of our Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. For example, the Municipal No. 3 Middle School sent 171 letters of condolence to this newspaper at one time. Each letter was full of infinite respect and concern for the soldiers of the Volunteer Army, as well as extreme hatred and contempt for American imperialism. Many students said affectionately: "Now the weather is getting colder every day. I hope you will pay attention to your health during the battle and wear more clothes to avoid catching a cold." The Municipal No. 9 Middle School also sent 35 letters of condolence at one time. Gao Jincheng, a first-year student, told the Volunteer Army comrades in his letter: "Many students in our school have signed up to join the Volunteer Army, preparing to fight alongside you; and we have also organized rescue teams and propaganda teams!" Tian Zhanran and Zhan Bingyong, second-year students from the Municipal No. 2 Middle School, wrote in their letters: "Dear uncles! You have shed blood for peace and paved the way for us to move towards a bright future. We must study hard and inherit your great spirit." Tian He from the Second Division of the Teachers' College Affiliated High School said: "We not only cheer for your victory, but also support you with practical actions. Many students and teachers have firmly stated that they will put down their pens and pick up their guns, vowing to be your backing." In addition, all the children in the third and fourth grades of Xiba Village Elementary School in the suburbs of Beijing also wrote letters to the comrades of the Volunteer Army to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. They said innocently at the end of the letter: "The weather is very cold now, you are so brave, the devils are afraid of you." Many children from the Eighth District Central Elementary School also wrote letters to the Volunteer Army comrades.
    In addition, many teachers and students from the Huimin College, North China Middle School, National Institute of Technology and other schools have also written letters to our Volunteer Army to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and the Korean People's Army, expressing their respect and condolences.

    此外，回民学院、华北中学、国立高工等校不少师生也先后给我援朝志愿部队和朝鲜人民军写信，向他们表示敬意和慰问。
