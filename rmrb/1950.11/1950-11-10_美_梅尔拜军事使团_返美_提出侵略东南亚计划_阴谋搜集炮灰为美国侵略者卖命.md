Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: The U.S. State Department and Department of Defense's "Melby Military Mission," after conducting a four-month "investigation" in the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaya, and Indonesia, returned to Washington last week. This delegation was dispatched to Southeast Asia to engage in aggressive activities two weeks after the U.S. launched its war of aggression against Korea.

According to a United Press Washington 2nd dispatch: Upon returning to Washington, the "Melby Military Mission" submitted a "highly confidential report" to the U.S. government, proposing an expanded aggression. The dispatch reveals that the report's content is to bring Southeast Asia into the U.S.'s so-called "overall plan to oppose communist aggression." The report suggests that the U.S. should give the French colonial army in Vietnam "priority" in "military assistance" to suppress the Vietnamese national liberation movement; it also suggests that the U.S. should pay "special attention" to the Philippines, an important U.S. military base in the Pacific.

According to another United Press Washington 5th dispatch: Erkins, the deputy head of the "Melby Military Mission," openly clamored on the 5th during a radio broadcast that the U.S. should "act immediately" in Southeast Asia and "cannot waste any more time." Erkins also conspired to collect cannon fodder in Southeast Asia to serve the U.S.'s aggressive aims. He said: He "discovered manpower potential in other places in Southeast Asia," and as long as they are "given appropriate training and equipment," the U.S. can use these people to "resist" so-called "communist pressure."

Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch: U.S. war-mongers openly clamor for the use of Japanese and other Asian people as cannon fodder in their wars of aggression. According to a Domei News Agency Los Angeles dispatch: Brigadier General Roberts, who is training the South Korean army, gave a speech here to major business managers, suggesting a new policy for U.S. intervention in Asia -- that is, to use Asian troops trained by the U.S. instead of using "white people." He shamelessly said: "Why can't we use Filipinos or Japanese? We only need to give them five U.S. dollars a month and a bowl of rice a day, and no rice if they don't fight! I believe that white people should only be sent to Asia to fight as a last resort."

　　美“梅尔拜军事使团”返美
    提出侵略东南亚计划
    阴谋搜集炮灰为美国侵略者卖命
    【新华社八日讯】美国国务院和国防部所派遣的“梅尔拜军事使团”，在菲律宾、越南、泰国、马来亚和印尼进行了历时四个月的“调查”后，已于上周返抵华盛顿。该代表团是在美国发动侵略朝鲜的战争两周后，被派赴东南亚从事侵略活动的。
    据合众社华盛顿二日讯：“梅尔拜军事使团”于返抵华盛顿后，即向美国政府提出一项扩大侵略的“非常秘密的报告”。该电透露，报告内容是使东南亚加入美国所谓“反对共产党侵略的总计划中去”。该报告建议美国应给予越南法国殖民军队“优先”的“军事援助”，以镇压越南的民族解放运动；同时建议应“特别注意”美国在太平洋的重要军事基地菲律宾。
    另据合众社华盛顿五日讯：“梅尔拜军事使团”副团长厄琴斯，于五日在广播中公然叫嚣美国在东南亚应“马上动手”，“再不能浪费时间”。厄琴斯并阴谋在东南亚搜集炮灰，为美国的侵略目的卖命。他说：他“在东南亚其他地方发现了人力潜力”，只要“予以适当的训练和装备”，美国便可以使用这些人“抵抗”所谓“共产党压力”。
    【新华社七日讯】美国战争贩子公然叫嚣利用日本人及亚洲其他国家的人民，充当其进行侵略战争的炮灰。据电通社洛杉矶讯：训练南朝鲜陆军的罗伯兹准将在此间向各大企业经理演说，建议美国干涉亚洲的一个新政策——就是使用美国训练的亚洲军队，不要使用“白人”。他无耻地说：“为什么我们不能利用菲律宾人或日本人呢？我们只要每月给他们五块美金，每天给他们一碗大米就够了，不作战就不给大米吃！我认为，只有作为最后的手段时才应派白人到亚洲作战。”
