Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 12th: The movement of the people of Tianjin from all walks of life to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country is continuing to develop. More than 50 units, including various democratic parties, mass organizations, government offices, factories, schools, and districts, have held symposiums on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect their homes and defend the country, and have conducted current affairs studies. The Tianjin Branch of the China Democratic League, the Tianjin Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Engineering Society and other units, in discussions, have further recognized the nearly hundred years of U.S. imperialist aggression against China and the U.S. conspiracy to invade Korea. These groups have successively issued declarations, resolving to take practical actions to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea.

　　Workers in major factories throughout the city have enthusiastically launched a patriotic production competition, and they have all guaranteed to complete the 1950 production tasks ahead of schedule. The average daily output of 20-count yarn at the state-owned Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Mill has reached 7,560 small packages, an increase of 55 percent over last month. The attendance rate of workers at the private Beiyang Yarn Factory has reached 100 percent in recent weeks. The No. 1 Power Plant of the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau has successfully completed the 1950 overhaul task, creating a new record for machine power generation efficiency, increasing the country's wealth equivalent to 48 million catties of millet. Students, women, and educators are stepping up national defense education, strengthening current affairs studies, and preparing to strike at U.S. aggressors at any time. All employees of the Municipal No. 3 Hospital are actively studying battlefield medical work and volunteering to serve in Korea.

　　Citizens from all walks of life have sent letters to the city's newspapers, expressing their willingness to go to the Korean front to participate in the Korean people's war of resistance against the United States. The Tianjin Daily received 740 letters of application on the 10th alone.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 14th: The broad masses of Tianjin citizens continue to file tearful accusations against the crimes committed by the U.S. military in Tianjin before liberation, and various newspapers have also devoted a great deal of space to exposing the bloody cases of U.S. military atrocities.

　　According to statistics from various newspapers, from October 1, 1945, to September 1947, in less than two years, the incomplete files of the Kuomintang reactionary government recorded 365 cases of car accidents, unwarranted killings, robberies, sabotage, and rapes committed by the U.S. military, with nearly 2,000 Chinese compatriots killed or injured.

　　These bloody cases were buried at the bottom of the sea during the rule of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary faction, a loyal running dog of the United States, and could not be reported. For example, sailor Fu Lianshan was knocked unconscious and thrown into the Hai River by American soldiers for buying a pair of American leather shoes. Guo Hongxun of Fenglin Village in the suburbs of Tianjin was crippled by a U.S. military vehicle, his fifteen-year-old daughter was killed, and his wife went crazy from crying. Chen Zhongxiu, a fourteen-year-old female worker at the China Textile No. 2 Factory, was raped to death by American soldiers and falsely accused of "suspicion of seduction." Zhang Xiuping, a young female citizen, was gang-raped by five U.S. military police officers, and although it was certified by a U.S. military doctor, the assistant captain of the U.S. military police still refused to admit it, while the Kuomintang reactionary government instead wrote in a "confidential, unrecorded" report: "The U.S. military police have been informed to notify the victim that they have been punished."

　　In recent days, citizens have angrily accused these bloody debts. Wang Deshan, a representative of the National Model Workers Conference and a worker at the state-owned Tianjin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, angrily accused: "American soldiers killed my friend Sun Yugui for no reason, and later falsely accused him of being a thief. Li YuChi, a fellow worker at our factory, was also hit on the head with a bottle by American soldiers. American soldiers also raped and killed Chen Zhongxiu, a fourteen-year-old female worker at our factory! There were too many things that American soldiers bullied us before liberation, and we must settle the new and old scores with them! We have the strength to defeat the aggression of U.S. imperialism!"

　　天津市民控诉美军暴行
    工厂职工热烈展开爱国生产竞赛各机关团体和学校加强时事学习
    【新华社天津十二日电】天津市各界人民抗美援朝保家卫国的运动正在继续发展。各民主党派、群众团体、机关、工厂、学校、各区等五十余单位曾分别举行抗美援朝保家卫国座谈会，并进行开展时事学习。民盟天津支部、民主建国会天津分会、天津市工商联合会、工程师学会等单位在讨论中，更进一步认清了美帝国主义近百年来对中国的侵略行为以及美国侵略朝鲜的阴谋。这些团体相继发表宣言，决以实际行动抗美援朝。
    全市各大工厂的职工们热烈地展开了爱国主义生产竞赛，他们纷纷保证提前完成一九五○年生产任务。国营天津第一棉织厂目前二十支纱的平均日产量已达七五六零小包，较上月增加百分之五十五。私营北洋纱厂的工人近周来到工率达百分之百。天津电业局第一发电厂已胜利完成一九五○年的检修任务，创造了机器发电效能的新纪录，增加国家财富合四千八百万斤小米。学生、妇女、教育工作者，均加紧国防教育，加强时事学习，准备随时打击美国侵略者。市立第三医院全体职工，正积极学习战地医疗工作，志愿准备赴朝鲜服务。
    各界市民纷纷向本市各报投书，表示到朝鲜前线参加朝鲜人民的抗美战争的志愿。天津日报十日一天即收到七百四十个人的志愿书。
    【新华社天津十四日电】天津市广大市民对解放前美军在津市的罪行继续提出血泪控诉，各报亦以极大篇幅揭露美军暴行的血案。
    据各报统计，自一九四五年十月一日到一九四七年九月不及两年的时间中，在国民党反动政府残缺不全的档案里即记载了美军制造的车祸、无故射杀、抢劫、捣毁、强奸等案件达三百六十五件，我国被害死伤的同胞近两千人。
    这些血案在美国忠实走狗蒋介石反动派统治时期冤沉海底，无法伸报。如水手傅连山因为买了一双美国皮鞋，竟被美兵摔昏后投入海河。津郊风林村的郭鸿勋被美军车辆撞成残废，十五岁的女儿被撞死，妻子哭疯了。中纺二厂十四岁女工陈忠秀被美兵强奸致死，反被诬为“有引诱嫌疑”。市民少女张秀萍，被五名美国宪兵轮奸后，虽经美军军医证明，但美宪兵助理队长仍坚不承认，而国民党反动政府反在《密不录由》的呈文上批示：“将美宪兵已函复惩办通知被害人知照可也。”
    连日来，市民们愤怒地控诉这些血泪深仇。出席全国劳模会议的代表国营天津第二棉纺织厂工人王德山激愤地控诉说：“美国兵无故地打死了我的朋友孙玉贵，事后反而诬赖他是一个小偷。我们工厂的工友李玉池也被美国兵用酒瓶打破了头。美国兵还强奸死了我们工厂十四岁的女工陈忠秀！解放前美国兵欺侮我们的事情太多了，我们要把新仇旧恨和他一笔算清！我们有力量打垮美帝国主义的侵略！”
