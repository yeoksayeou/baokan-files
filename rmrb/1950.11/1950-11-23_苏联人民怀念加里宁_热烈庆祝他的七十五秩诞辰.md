　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th: Today, the Soviet people commemorate the 75th birthday of Mikhail Kalinin, the glorious son of the Russian people, an outstanding leader of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government, and a loyal disciple and close comrade-in-arms of Lenin and Stalin, with boundless love. Kalinin dedicated 50 years of his life to the cause of the working class and to the struggle for the victory of Leninist ideals. He continuously held the position of head of the highest Soviet organ for a long period of 27 years.
    Exhibitions displaying Kalinin's glorious life and revolutionary career have been opened in various enterprises, institutions, schools, and higher education institutions in Moscow, and in districts named after Kalinin. The Soviet State Lenin Museum has opened an exhibition of Kalinin's works on the Soviet state and society. Kalinin's works, papers, and speeches are being widely circulated. According to the statistics of the All-Union Book Publishing House, Kalinin's works have been published in 75 languages, with a total circulation of 55 million copies. Kalinin's work "What Soviet Power Has Given to the Working People" has been translated and published in 51 languages.
    During these days of celebrating Kalinin's 75th birthday, the Kalinin Museum, which was opened in Moscow this summer according to the decision of the Soviet government, has seen a large increase of visitors. In this short period of time, tens of thousands of visitors have visited this museum. Countless exhibits have been collected in the halls of the museum, helping to recreate the outstanding image of this great revolutionary.
    Among the residents of Leningrad, a city closely related to Kalinin, talks and reports on Kalinin's 75th birthday are being held. At the end of the 19th century, Kalinin began working as a lathe operator at the Putilov factory, now named after Kirov. The workers of the Kirov factory deeply remember their worker brother and comrade who once served as the leader of the Soviet government. A memorial plaque is nailed to the factory gate, narrating the first few pages of Kalinin's revolutionary biography. The lathe on which Kalinin worked has been preserved. Exhibitions about Kalinin's life and career have been opened at the Engels Factory and the Kalinin Institute of Technology. In 1917, Kalinin served as chairman at a workers' and students' meeting where Lenin delivered a speech.
    The entire Soviet Union is celebrating Kalinin's 75th birthday.
