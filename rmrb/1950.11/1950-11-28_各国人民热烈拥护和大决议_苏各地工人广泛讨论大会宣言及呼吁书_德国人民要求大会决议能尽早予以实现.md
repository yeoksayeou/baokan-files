Prokofiev, an old miner and socialist labor hero from the Ordzhonikidze mine, said: The World Peace Congress has vividly demonstrated the unanimous demand of upright people around the world to stop war and maintain peace. We miners of the Donbas are determined to defend world peace by strengthening the power of our motherland. The Congress's declaration has been read out in factories in Kyiv, and workers and engineers have expressed their enthusiastic support for these documents. Savgaloni, a Stakhanovite worker at the "Ukabel" factory, said: The Congress's call is the call of all good people. We firmly believe that the forces of peace will defeat war.

Mass rallies are being held throughout the Soviet Union in preparation for the local Soviet elections on December 17th. The resolutions of the Peace Congress have been read out and discussed at many polling stations. At a mass meeting in the fiftieth electoral district of Leningrad, housewife Kosinzheva said: "I support the solemn resolutions of the Peace Congress. I want my children to receive education and build a communist society, not to know the horrors of war." Rostovtseva, a candidate for the Soviet in the Kuibyshev district, said: Soviet mothers, wives, and sisters all wholeheartedly support the various resolutions of the Peace Congress.

The working people of the German Democratic Republic have been holding meetings to discuss the resolutions of the Peace Congress, demanding that they be implemented as soon as possible. All employees of the Schick Ultditz state-owned machine-building enterprise passed a resolution stating: We want to live in a peaceful environment, and we will join the 500 million peace fighters around the world to defeat all conspiracies to expand the Korean War into a world war and to turn West Germany and Japan into new battlefields.

The Czech Communist Party's newspaper *Rude Pravo* published remarks by working people from all over the Czech Republic supporting the Congress's resolutions. The production competition launched by the working people of Czechoslovakia to celebrate the World Peace Congress has achieved brilliant results. Many enterprises in Prague, Bratislava, Gottwaldov, and other states have completed their annual production plans.

Bulgaria's *Fatherland Front* newspaper pointed out: The despicable attempts by American and British imperialists to obstruct the holding of the World Peace Congress have had the opposite result. The Warsaw Congress clearly showed that the forces of peace far outweigh the forces of war, and peace will be able to stop war. The Danish Communist Party's newspaper *Land and People* published a speech by Professor Fog, the Danish representative who attended the Peace Congress, stating: I believe that the achievements of the Congress will awaken new and powerful forces for peace.
