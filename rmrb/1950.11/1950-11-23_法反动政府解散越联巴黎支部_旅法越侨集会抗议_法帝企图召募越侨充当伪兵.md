    French Reactionary Government Dissolves Viet Lien Paris Branch
    Overseas Vietnamese in France Rally to Protest
    French Imperialists Attempt to Recruit Overseas Vietnamese as Puppet Troops
    [This newspaper reports from Paris] According to dispatches from Paris: In early October this year, the French colonial army suffered successive heavy blows from the Vietnamese People's Army in northern Vietnam. The French Pleven government, enraged by this, actually ordered the dissolution of the Paris branch of the Vietnam National United Front. Overseas Vietnamese in France felt extremely angry about this reactionary measure. On October 8th, Overseas Vietnamese in Paris held a gathering at the Ai You Association Hall, presided over by Dr. Hoang Xuan Man. The resolution was to print propaganda materials to protest to French imperialism against the atrocities of dissolving the Paris branch of the Vietnam National United Front, and solemnly stated that Vietnamese expatriates will still follow the instructions of the Vietnam National United Front, unite and help each other more closely, firmly support the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, and unite with French democratic forces to fight against French imperialists.
    Note: The Vietnam National United Front (referred to as Viet Lien), founded in 1946, is a national patriotic people's organization in Vietnam, including various Vietnamese democratic parties, all classes, all people's organizations, all religious organizations, various professional sectors and enlightened gentry. Since its establishment, Viet Lien has launched a relentless struggle with the French aggressors. The Paris branch of Viet Lien leads the Overseas Vietnamese in France, together with the progressive people of France, to oppose the "dirty war" carried out by the French reactionaries in Vietnam, and launch a patriotic emulation movement to help the anti-French war of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
    [Another dispatch] The French reactionary government, due to insufficient invading forces in Vietnam, attempted to recruit Overseas Vietnamese in France to serve as puppet troops; in the Asian region, it intends to recruit a battalion of puppet troops. Progressive Overseas Vietnamese generally expressed their opposition. Viet Lien personnel in Paris are conducting propaganda and explanations among the Overseas Vietnamese to combat this shameless means of the French reactionary government.

　　法反动政府解散越联巴黎支部
    旅法越侨集会抗议
    法帝企图召募越侨充当伪兵
    【本报讯】据巴黎通讯：今年十月初，法国殖民军在越北连续受到越南人民军的痛击，法国普利文政府恼羞成怒，竟下令解散越南国民联合会在巴黎的支会。旅法越侨对这种反动措施，感到异常愤怒。十月八日，巴黎越侨在爱友会馆举行集会，由黄春满博士主持。决议刊印宣传品，向法帝国主义抗议解散越南国民联合会巴黎支部的暴行，并严正表示，越南侨民将仍依照越南国民联合会的指示，更密切地团结互助，坚决拥护胡志明主席的领导，并与法国民主力量联合起来对法帝国主义者作斗争。
    按越南国民联合会（简称越联），创立于一九四六年，是越南全国性的爱国人民的组织，包括越南各民主党派、各阶层、各人民团体、各宗教团体、各种职业部门和开明士绅。越联自成立时起即与法国侵略者，展开无情的斗争。巴黎的越联支部，领导着旅法越侨，与法国进步人民一起，反对法国反动派在越南所进行的“肮脏战争”，并展开爱国竞赛运动，帮助越南民主共和国的抗法战争。
    【又讯】法国反动政府因其侵越兵力不足，企图在法国召募越侨充当伪兵；在亚今地方，即打算募集伪军一营。越南进步侨民普遍表示反对。巴黎的越联人士正在侨民间进行宣传和解释，打击法国反动政府的这一无耻手段。
