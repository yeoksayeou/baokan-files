(From Our Newspaper) People all over the country are writing letters, donating money and goods to express their sympathy and support for the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting in Korea to resist American aggression and defend our homes and country.

	Wang Mingzhi, a farmer from Liutiaogou in the Changbai Mountain area of Tonghua City, Northeast China, wrote to his second brother, who had volunteered to fight in Korea: "Now my eldest brother has also volunteered to join the stretcher team, preparing to cross the river to help the Korean people defend their hometown. I am determined to be a production model at home and actively support you." The entire group of farmers from the Fourth Administrative Group of Dongjing Village, Yanji County, Jilin Province, donated 2.6 million yuan in cash on the spot during a recent gathering to express their sympathy to the Korean People's Army and our volunteer army, and donated part of it to the disaster-stricken people in northern Anhui.

	Workers, farmers, and students in the suburbs of Beijing enthusiastically donated money and goods to support the front lines in Korea. As of the 18th, the Beijing Paper Mill employees had donated a total of 2,341 catties of salary rice, 69 comfort bags, 58 towels, 32 bars of soap, 14 bags of tooth powder, and 4 pairs of socks. Li Xihe, a printing worker at the Supply Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, donated 154,000 yuan of the bonus he received from saving paper as a consolation fund. After studying current affairs and denouncing the crimes of imperialism against the Chinese people, the employees of the Xijiao Park in Beijing enthusiastically signed up to join the volunteer army. All union members decided to donate 2 million yuan (plus 10,000 yuan donated by Mao Honghai personally) of the welfare fund accumulated over half a year to the Korean People's Army and our volunteer army in Korea to purchase airplanes and tanks. The employees also wrote 27 letters of sympathy. The peasants of Tiancun Village in the 15th District of Beijing suburbs were extremely resentful of the American imperialist aggression. The whole village donated 57 towels, more than 100 bars of soap, 34 packs of cigarettes, 10 and a half dozen pencils, 12 small diaries, and one comfort bag. Two farmers who could not buy anything else in the village donated two mirrors. Li Qingde, a model worker in the village, was willing to donate two bags of flour to comfort the Korean People's Army and our volunteer army in Korea. Patients recuperating in the Heishanhu Sanatorium in the suburbs of Beijing were also very concerned about the Korean People's Army resisting the American bandits. In addition to all the patients saving 301,500 yuan in food expenses as a consolation fund, 52 tuberculosis patients from the army, government agencies, factories, and schools also saved 500,000 yuan in food expenses to donate to the Korean People's Army. Schools in Beijing have not only organized anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda teams, but have also launched various volunteer support activities. The Journalism Department of Yenching University launched a "Fifty Hand Grenades Donation Campaign" (equivalent to 1 million yuan), and the number soon exceeded fifty. As of the 9th, all faculty and students of the North China People's Revolutionary University had donated 50 million yuan in cash and more than 1,000 catties of millet. The Department of Mechanical Engineering of the North China University of Technology recently invited the head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering to lecture on common sense of weapons, and invited the People's Liberation Army to teach grenade throwing. Lin Hua, a student from the Foreign Languages ​​School, donated his own coat. Fan Binglei, a senior high school student from the No. 2 Municipal Middle School, also donated the 20,000 yuan pocket money sent to him by his mother. As of the 18th, the Junior 2nd Grade Class A of the No. 3 Municipal Middle School had made 45 comfort bags and written more than 150 letters of sympathy. The Women's Affiliated High School of Normal University held a lecture on first aid knowledge. All teachers, students and staff of the Private Mingde Primary School donated a total of 121,500 yuan, asking our newspaper to forward it to the front line in Korea. The students are now automatically making comfort bags, some embroidering the words "Bravely Kill the Enemy" on the bags, and some are rushing to knit gloves, scarves, and other comforting items.

	Yang Zhenlun and other 44 workers from Langfang Station are determined to be the backing of our people's volunteer army in Korea to resist American aggression and aid Korea, and each donated a towel and a bar of soap as a practical gift. Peng Dalong, a 71-year-old farmer from Peng Village, the Second District of Hengshui County, Hebei Province, asked someone to write a letter to Chairman Mao, guaranteeing to save money and food, and volunteered to save 500 catties of grain to support the Korean People's Army and our People's Volunteer Army. Sun Zan, a student from an engineering school in Zhangjiakou, resolutely donated the 500,000 yuan that his family had sent him for emergencies, fearing "the tense situation," to support the anti-American and aid-Korea movement.

	The people of East China are increasingly enthusiastically donating materials to express their sympathy and support for the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. All the female workers of the Nanjing Democratic Women's Federation Sewing Factory jointly made a large comfort bag and sewed many comforting items such as bullet belts, cotton shoes, and socks. Factories in Wuxi launched a campaign to donate comfort bags. All the members of the Youth League of the Sixth Group of the Qingfeng Yarn Factory wrote in their two notebooks: We hope that the heroic commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army will record the number of American invading troops eliminated every day after receiving them. The workers in the roving yarn workshop wrote the words "Wishing you victory" on their comfort bags to express their concern for the Korean people. Young worker Shi Rongdi happily said after making a comfort bag: "China and Korea are as close as lips and teeth. Comforting the Korean People's Army is like comforting our own relatives and friends." At the anti-American and aid-Korea conference held by the East China Youth League School, 84 people donated 1,710,900 yuan in cash and 5 gold rings on the spot. The Young Pioneers of Madaojie Elementary School in Nanjing learned from the example of the Soviet Young Pioneers raising funds to buy tanks to fight the German invaders and launched a donation campaign to aid the Korean people. They have now donated 301,900 yuan saved from candy money. Schools in Fuzhou have also universally launched a campaign to save money and donate money and write a letter of sympathy per person.

	Fifty-nine elementary school teachers in the Henan District of Guangzhou voluntarily donated 2% of their monthly salary to aid the Korean people.

	The democratic youth of all ethnic groups in Dihua City, far away in the western frontier of the motherland, said in a collective letter of sympathy to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army: "Tell you, we have actively mobilized! In order to support your heroic battle in Korea, defend the country, and resist the invaders, we are always ready to fight the enemy side by side with you and fight together."
