Xinhua News Agency, New York, 27th (TASS): The National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States recently issued a statement to the press, denouncing Attorney General McGrath's request that the so-called "Subversive" Activities Control Board order the Communist Party to register under the McCarran Act. It called on all individuals and organizations to protest the illegal fascist measures against the Communist Party and demanded the immediate repeal of the McCarran Act.

In its statement, the National Committee of the CPUSA, after denouncing McGrath's slander as Nazi-style abuse of the communist movement, revealed that McGrath chose to take this action at this time because it is precisely "when the American people are becoming increasingly alert to the government's war provocations." McGrath's action "is a step toward vigorously implementing the McCarran Act" and "is another measure toward closing off the voices of American peace advocates and outlawing all sectors of the people who are carrying out the peace movement, together with the Communist Party."

The statement pointed out: "McGrath declared the Communist Party's anti-war and anti-fascist peace policy 'guilty' because it is consistent with the Soviet Union's peace policy. Non-Communist Americans who agree with this policy of the Communist Party and favor the People's Republic of China joining the United Nations and a quick end to the Korean War are also deemed 'guilty.' McGrath's order is the beginning of an endless chain. This chain will lock up millions of Americans through litigation by accusing them of the collective 'crime' of intending to strive for world peace."

The statement concluded by saying that another purpose of the current attack on the Communist Party is to divide the strong and growing movement of the people demanding the repeal of the McCarran Act.

The statement emphasized: "No court jury has the right; only the voters—the people—have the right to judge the policies, programs, and practices of a political party."

### 美共痛斥美司法部长反共命令  号召人民抗议并要求立即废止麦卡伦法

　　美共痛斥美司法部长反共命令
    号召人民抗议并要求立即废止麦卡伦法
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十七日讯：美国共产党全国委员会顷向报界发表声明，痛斥司法部长麦格拉斯要求所谓“颠覆”活动管制委员下令共产党按麦卡伦法进行登记一举，并号召一切个人和组织抗议对共产党的非法的法西斯措置，并要求立即废止麦卡伦法。
    美共全国委员会在声明中斥责麦格拉斯的谰言是对共产主义运动的纳粹式的谩骂以后，揭露麦格拉斯所以挑选这个时候来采取这一行动，是因为现在正“是美国人民对政府的战争挑衅日益表现警觉的时候”，麦格拉斯的行动“是大力实施麦卡伦法的一个步骤”，“是走向闭塞美国和平拥护者的呼声、并使开展和平运动的各阶层人民和共产党一起成为非法的又一措施。”
    声明指出：“麦格拉斯之所以宣布共产党反战、反法西斯主义的和平政策为‘有罪’，乃是因为它们与苏联的和平政策一致。那些同意共产党这种政策并赞成中华人民共和国加入联合国及迅速结束朝鲜战争的非共产党美国人，也同样被认为‘有罪’。麦格拉斯这一命令是一条无穷尽的锁链的开端。这条锁链将通过诉讼，以控告犯有立意要争取世界和平的集体‘罪状’的办法，将把千百万美国人锁闭起来。”
    声明最后并称：目前对共产党的进攻的另一目的，是分裂人民要求废止麦卡伦法的强大和日益增涨的运动。
    声明强调指出：“任何法院陪审团，都没有权利，只有选民——人民，才有权利裁判一个政党的政策、纲领与实践。”
