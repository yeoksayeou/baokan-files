If the American Robber Comes, I Will Chop Him to Death with a Knife!
Visiting Two Model Old Ladies in the Capital's Peace Signature Campaign
Ji Gang

Comrades Gao Yuquan and Zhang Yangshi, two well-known model warriors in the capital's peace signature campaign, actively participated in this patriotic movement to resist America and aid Korea. Now, they are intensifying their study of current affairs at the Third Cultural Center and the Eighth Police Station of the Second District, preparing to learn it well themselves before going to the masses to publicize it. They are very indignant at the successive and mad aggressions of our country by American imperialism. They said, "We are not old yet. We have to publicize more, so that everyone can understand the truth, see through the wolfish ambitions of American imperialism, and expose this paper tiger of American imperialism!"

Can't Forget the Imperialist Scourge for a Lifetime

Recently, I visited these two old ladies. The homes of Old Ladies Gao and Zhang are both located on Erlong Road, Xidan, Second District, in the city. They are both in their fifties. During the signature campaign to defend world peace in July this year, they got up early and went to bed late, traveling from Xicheng to Dongcheng, publicizing and collecting signatures everywhere. Within a week, they collected 8,234 peace signatures. Some people ridiculed them as fools and madmen. The two of them paid no attention to this ignorant ridicule. Old Lady Gao said, "Actually, I am neither a fool nor a madman! It's just that the imperialist scourge harmed my whole family. This is something I can never forget in my life. Comrade, listen to me talk about the past, and you will know whether I should go out and publicize or not? Can I let others be manipulated by imperialism again?"

Old Lady Gao painfully recalled the past fifty years. She said, "I am a person who has suffered from imperialist oppression. I was only three years old when I encountered the Boxer Rebellion. The foreign soldiers of the Eight-Nation Alliance came to fight us, forcing my family to flee from Jinan Prefecture, Shandong, to the Northeast. My father made a living by buying and selling grain. When I was four years old, my whole family was infected with the plague. My father died, a tragic death. My mother took me and my two younger brothers and had to go to my grandmother's house in Renjiatun, outside Shenyang, to live, relying on weaving fishing nets to make a living. When I was fifteen or sixteen years old, the warlords inside and outside the Pass fought a big melee, and Japanese imperialism took the opportunity to come in. The *taizi* (Japanese soldiers) ran rampant, and the countryside was uneasy. My mother was afraid that the Japanese devils would have evil intentions towards me, so she had to marry me to someone as his third concubine. At that time, I was so angry that I couldn't even cry."

Her eyes were red, and tears welled up in her eyes. She continued, "I suffered all kinds of torture in that family, and gave birth to two daughters and a son. My son was only five years old when his father died. As a widow, in a world where Japanese devils robbed and plundered and there was chaos everywhere, it was so difficult to raise my children to adulthood! But one year, the Japanese devils conscripted soldiers and wanted to grab my 'only son.' Later, I asked someone to give gifts to get through this difficulty, but then came the 'labor conscription.' I asked someone again... It was not easy to find a position as an elementary school teacher for my son, avoiding 'labor conscription,' but the principal happened to be a lackey of the Japanese devils. My son was sick, but he was not allowed to ask for leave or go home, which caused him to develop severe pleurisy. To this day, he cannot go out to work because his health is ruined."

After calming down a little, her eyes brightened, and she said excitedly, "I have known our Eighth Route Army for more than a year or two. When the Japanese invaders surrendered, the Eighth Route Army troops drove to the outskirts of Shenyang, and Soviet troops also lived there. The comrades treated the common people so well, warmly and kindly. I saw it with my own eyes, and I understood that it was our people's army. At that time, I also cooked for our troops." She continued with infinite affection, "The Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army are doing things for our common people. Now, we don't have to worry about food and drink, and women can also stand up. I want to use my old strength. Comrade, are you right?"

Old Lady Zhang is also from Shenyang. She also recounted the situation of the warlords and Japanese devils running rampant in the countryside and the people suffering from disasters. They both said, "The imperialists in the world are all the same black-hearted. We have suffered enough from the Japanese devils, and we cannot let American imperialism invade us again! We collect signatures to unite everyone's strength to oppose American imperialist aggression against Korea and our Taiwan and defend world peace. Now, American imperialism has revealed its ugly face, and we must use action to resist it!" Old Lady Zhang also emphasized, "To prevent others from suffering the hardships we have suffered, we must go out and publicize!"

If You Have a Mouth, Just Chat!

The two old ladies became more and more enthusiastic when talking about publicity. While gesturing, they also made self-criticisms. At first glance, no one would believe that they are people in their fifties!

Old Lady Gao said as if she was summarizing a report, "The first thing to do in publicity is to be patient. The second is not to be afraid of hardship or shame, and to publicize and answer questions raised by the masses. When we were doing the peace signature work, we got up early and went to bed late, and we went everywhere we saw crowds. Anyway, we have a mouth under our nose, so let's just chat. ... Well, but we also have shortcomings. Our 'methods and ways' are not right. It is not enough to just have a lot of anger. We have to pay attention to effectiveness. For example, in July this year, when we went to the Cultural Palace to sign, we met a Korean woman and asked her to sign. She was so moved that she shed tears and thanked me in Chinese, saying, 'We are so grateful to the Chinese women comrades for publicizing this.' But I forgot to ask her name and her background. If I had asked, it would have been very helpful for our publicity."

Old Lady Zhang added: If the masses have questions that they don't understand, don't answer them randomly. Come back and study them thoroughly with everyone before speaking.

If I Can't Go to the Front, I Will Do Publicity Work in the Rear.

Old Lady Zhang said with full confidence, "American soldiers are arrogant, they are 'young master soldiers.' Which imperialist country's army can compare with our army? I'm not bragging, but let everyone comment on this. Sooner or later, the American imperialists will end up like the Japanese devils. I dare to bet with anyone on this." She immediately talked about herself again: "If I can't go to the front, I can do publicity work in the rear. Anyway, I only have one sentence: if there is work, I will do it."

Old Lady Gao was even more unconvinced. She said, "To want peace is not to say that we shouldn't resist when people have already attacked our doorstep. That would be foolish! I am impatient. A few days ago, when the district established the Women's Federation Preparatory Committee, I and Old Lady Zhang said together during a forum on current affairs: If the American robbers come, I will chop them to death with a knife! We must study hard now, and when we have studied well, we will go out to publicize, organize forums in each courtyard and household. If everyone understands the truth, our hearts will be connected together, and that will be so powerful! We will definitely be more active and hardworking than when we collected 8,234 peace signatures in a week!"

　　如果美国强盗来，我就拿刀剁死它！
    访首都和平签名工作中的两位模范老大娘
    纪刚
    闻名首都的和平签名工作中的模范战士——高玉泉、张杨氏两位老大娘，积极参加了这次抗美援朝的爱国运动，现在，她们正在第三文化馆和第二区第八派出所加紧学习时事，准备自己学好后，再去向群众宣传。她们对美帝国主义接二连三地疯狂侵略我国，非常愤恨，她们说：“我们还不老，我们得多宣传，让大家都明白道理，看透美帝国主义的狼心狗肺，戳穿美帝国主义这只纸老虎！”
    一辈子忘不了帝国主义害人精
    最近，我去访问了这两位老大娘。高、张两位老大娘的家，都住在市内第二区西单二龙路，都是五十多岁的人了，在今年七月间的保卫世界和平签名运动中，她们两个早起晚睡，转过西城到东城，到处宣传、征集签名，一周内就征集了八千二百三十四人的和平签名。有的人曾讽刺过她们是傻子和疯子，她们两位对这种无知的讽刺，毫不在意，高老大娘说：“其实，我才不傻不疯哩！只是因为帝国主义这个害人精，害了我一家子，这是我一辈子也忘不了的。同志，你听我说说过去，就知道我该宣传去不？我能再让旁人受帝国主义的摆布吗？”
    高老大娘沉痛地追忆着五十多年来的过去，她说：“我是受过帝国主义压迫的人，三岁正赶上庚子变乱，八国联军洋兵来打我们，逼得我们家从山东济南府逃荒到东北去；靠我爹买卖粮食过日子。我四岁上，全家都传染上了鼠疫，爹死了，死得好惨。妈领着我和两个弟弟，只得到沈阳郊外任家屯姥姥家去住，靠织鱼网过活，到我十五、六岁时，关内外军阀大混战，日本帝国主义趁机进来了，腿子横行，乡里不安。我妈怕鬼子坏蛋对我起歹心，不得不把我嫁给人做第三房姨太太，那时，气得我连哭都哭不出来。
    她眼圈红着，泪水在眼眶里转，她继续说：“我在人家，受尽了折磨，生了两个闺女，一个小子。小子刚五岁，她爹就死了。我一个孀妇，在日本鬼子横抢乱夺、兵慌马乱的世道里，把孩子拉大成人，多么不易呀！可是有一年，日本鬼子抓兵，就要抓我‘独生子’，后来托人送礼，才过了这一关，但接着又来了‘抓劳工’，我又托人……好容易才给我小子找了个小学教员的位置，免了‘劳工’，碰上校长又是鬼子的狗腿子，我小子有病，也不准他请假、回家，害得他得了严重的肋膜炎，直到今天，就因为身体坏，不能出去工作。”
    稍微平静了一下，她的眼睛明亮开来，她激动地说：“我认识咱们八路军可不是一年两年啦，日寇投降时节，八路军队伍曾开到沈阳近郊，苏联军队也住过，同志们待老百姓太好了，热火又和气，我亲眼见到过，就懂得了那是咱们老百姓的队伍，那时，我还给咱们队伍做过饭哪。”她无限深情地接着说：“共产党、八路军是给咱们老百姓办事的，现在，吃喝不愁了，妇女也能出头了，我要使出我这点老力，同志，你说对不对？”
    张老大娘也是沈阳人，她也追述了军阀、日本鬼子横行乡里，人民受灾祸的情形。她们都说：“天下的帝国主义都是一样的黑心肠，受够了日本鬼子的气，不能再叫美帝国主义来侵略我们了！我们征集签名，就是想联合大伙力量，反对美帝侵略朝鲜和我们的台湾，保卫世界和平。现在，美帝国主义已露出丑恶的嘴脸，我们要用行动来抗击它！”张老大娘还着重地说道：“为了我们吃的苦，不让旁人去吃，我们就得去宣传宣传！”
    有张嘴，就唠嗑罢！
    两位老大娘，谈到做宣传，越谈越起劲。一面做手势一面还做检讨，一眼看来，谁也不相信他们是五十开外的人啦！
    高老大娘像在总结报告似的说：“做宣传头一条就得有耐心，第二条不辞辛苦、不害臊，按着群众提出的问题去宣传解答。我们搞和平签名工作时，早起晚睡，见了人群便躜。反正鼻子底下有张嘴，就唠嗑罢。……嗯，可是我们也有缺点，‘方式方法’不对，光火气盛是不行的，得讲究功效，比方今年七月间，我们到文化宫签名时，遇到一位朝鲜妇女，就让她签名，她感动得流下眼泪来，用中国话向我道谢说：‘我们真感谢中国妇女同志这样宣传。’可是我就忘了问人家姓名，和她的身世，如果问了，那对我们宣传多有好处啊。”
    张老大娘补充着：群众有了问题弄不通，不要乱回答。回来跟大伙儿研究通了再去说。
    不叫我上前方，就在后方做宣传工作。
    张老大娘充满万分信心地说：“美国兵骄，是‘少爷兵’，我国陆军，那个帝国主义国家的陆军比得上？不是我吹，这可让大家评论评论，早晚美帝和日本鬼子一样的下场，这我敢和任何人打赌。”马上又谈到她自己：“不叫我上前方，可以在后方作宣传工作。反正我是一句话，有工作就干去。”
    高老大娘更不服气，她说：“要和平，不是说人家打到门口来了还不反抗，那才是傻子呢！我性子急，前几天区里成立妇联筹委会时，座谈时事，我就和张大娘一同说：如果美国强盗来了，我就拿刀剁死它！我们现在要好好学习，学习好就去宣传，组织各院各户座谈，大家把道理弄明白了，心就连在一起，那力量多大啊！我们一定比在一个礼拜征集八千二百三十四人的和平签名时，还要积极努力！”
