　　We Would Rather Die Than Suffer the Humiliation of American Imperialism Again
    — A Record of the Anti-American Denunciation Meeting at the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau —
    Cao Yali
    The Telephone Division Five and the Long Distance Department of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau held several anti-American denunciation meetings on November 10th and 11th. At the meetings, many people poured out their grievances from the time of imperialist rule. Remembering the pain of those years, everyone cried. Wu Huizhen, a female worker from the long-distance exchange, fainted on the spot and did not regain consciousness for more than an hour. Recalling the crimes of American and Japanese imperialism in Beijing in the past, everyone gnashed their teeth with hatred. Everyone clenched their fists, and some cried out: "For decades, we have suffered enough from the trampling and oppression of imperialism. Today, the Chinese people have stood up, and we can no longer tolerate the arrogance of imperialism. If American imperialism dares to invade us, the flames of revenge of the Chinese people will scorch them!" The workers recalled the past bestial behavior of American soldiers in Division Five. Zhao Wenzhong, a worker in the machine room, slapped the table angrily and said: "After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, a group of communication soldiers from the US Marine Corps entered Division Five. They ran amok in Division Five, driving jeeps wildly in the yard during the day and shooting randomly. The beast soldiers occupied our bathhouse and did not allow the workers to take baths. Once, we sneaked in to take a bath, and they locked us in the bathhouse for a night, and the next day they forced the director to fire us. Once, American beasts kidnapped Chinese women in the middle of the night and gang-raped her in the bathroom. The victim could not bear their insults and cried incessantly, shouting for help. Listening to the screams, it was like a knife stabbing our hearts. We really wanted to beat them severely, but we didn't dare to rescue her. We ran outside and called the police, and finally managed to drag the woman out." The old lineman Yu Kunxiang denounced: "In 1944, I went to a Japanese man's house with Head Xie (also an old lineman) to repair the telephone. He said that we stole his things. A few days later, he took us to the police station and asked us if we had done anything bad. We said no, and they beat us with big sticks. They stripped us naked, tied us to a bench, put a wooden box over our heads, and poured cold water on us under the faucet. We passed out several times in a row. Finally, they wrapped electric wires around our fingers and genitals and passed electricity through them... Later, when we came out, we were no longer human beings!" Chen Shilin, a female model worker from the long-distance exchange, cried and said: "I worked as a servant for the Japanese from the age of nine. Later, they didn't want me because I was too young. At the age of twelve, in order to make a living, I went to work as a servant for the Japanese again. I couldn't finish the hard work all day long. I had to wait until twelve o'clock at night to open the door. I ate mixed noodles and was often beaten by the Japanese. I cried until I had no tears left. All these things were given to me by imperialism. Today, I want to turn hatred into strength. I want to do my job well. I will do whatever the organization tells me to do!" Wu Huizhen said: "I lost my father when I was four years old, and my mother is disabled. I entered the telephone bureau when I was fifteen years old. I earned very little money at that time, and I also suffered from the Japanese. Because I couldn't get enough to eat, I sometimes worked at night and sold tickets at the racecourse during the day. Once, after selling the tickets, I went to the station and saw that the train was full of Japanese. There was no way to squeeze on. At this time, a Chinese person said: "Damn, using the train to control the people!" The Japanese heard it and took all the people waiting for the train to the western suburbs. They pressed the chests with guns with bayonets and asked who said it? No one dared to say anything. Everyone pleaded for a long time before they let us go back." She said: "Imperialists are all the same. Today, American imperialism is invading us again. We must use all our strength to resist it. I will insist on working in any situation." Comrade Wang Wenhua, who never liked to talk, went on stage and only said one sentence: "Do you know how my father and mother died?" Tears welled up like a spring, and everyone cried with her. She suppressed herself and continued: "My father used to teach painting at Jinghua Art Academy. One night, two Japanese soldiers came and took my father away without saying anything. My mother, sister, brother, and I were also kept under surveillance and were not allowed to go out. Later, the Japanese soldiers told my mother that she could redeem my father with gold bars. So my mother sold all the things she had when she got married and took my sister with her to redeem my father with the Japanese soldiers and police. My younger brother and I stayed at home and waited until the evening of the next day before my mother and sister came back, but even my father's shadow was not to be seen. It turned out we were deceived!" Everyone cried even harder when they heard this. She said with tears in her eyes, biting her lip: "We will never see our father again. Later, my mother also went crazy!" She couldn't continue crying. The grief pressed down on everyone's heads. Finally, she said: "I have never cried before. I have no tears. I have had hatred since I was sensible. I have thought since I was a child that as long as I have a breath, I will avenge my father and mother!" People shouted: "As long as we live for one day, we will fight American imperialism for one day. We don't cry, we turn tears into bullets, and we turn grief into strength. We will take revenge in our work!"

　　死也不能再受美帝的蹂躏
    ——记北京电信局反美控诉大会——
    曹亚力
    北京电信局电话五分局及长途处等单位于十一月十、十一两日接连地召开了几次反美控诉大会。会上，许多人吐出了过去帝国主义统治时的一肚子苦水。想起了当年的痛苦，大伙儿都哭了。长途台女工吴慧贞当场哭昏过去，一个多小时才苏醒过来。回忆起美帝及日帝过去在北京的罪行，大家恨得咬牙切齿。个个攥紧了拳头，有人呼诉着：“几十年来我们受够了帝国主义的蹂躏和压迫，今天我们中国人民站起来了，我们再也不能受帝国主义的气了，美国帝国主义胆敢来侵略我们，中国人民复仇的火焰会把它们烧焦！”工人们想起了过去美国兵在五局的野兽行为，机械室工人赵文忠气得拍着桌子说：“抗日胜利后，五局开进来了一批美国海军陆战队的通讯兵，他们在五局横行霸道，白天在院子里开着吉普车胡撞，随便开枪乱打。兽军占领了我们的澡塘不许工人洗澡。我们有一次溜进去洗了一次澡，让他们给关到澡塘里给停了一夜，第二天就逼令局长开除我们。有一次美国野兽们半夜里掳来了中国的妇女，在澡房中九个人轮奸了她，遭难者受不了它们的侮辱，哭得不成人声了，大喊救命。我们听着那嚎声，像刀子扎心，真想狠狠的去揍它一顿，可是又不敢去营救，跑到外面叫了警察，才算将女人死拉活拖地给救了出去。”老线工郁坤祥控诉说：一九四四年我跟谢头（也是位老线工）去日本人家修电话，他说我们偷了他的东西，过了几天把我们弄到警务段去了，问我们作不好的事情没有，我们说没有，他们就用大棍子打，又将我俩衣服剥光了，捆在凳子上，脑袋上扣上木匣，拉到自来水龙头下灌凉水，一连死过去好几回，最后用电线缠在手指和生殖器上过电……后来，我们出来时都不成人样了！长途台女工模范陈士琳哭诉着说：“我从九岁就给日本人当使女，后嫌我小不要了。十二岁那年，为了生活，我又去给日本人去做使女，一天的苦活做不完，晚上等门要等到十二点，吃的是混合面，还时常遭到日本人的毒打，哭全都没有眼泪。这些都是帝国主义给我的，今天我要把恨变成力量，我要好好的在本岗位上干，组织叫我干什么就干什么！”吴慧贞说：“四岁我就没有了父亲，母亲是个残废，十五岁我便进了电话局，那时挣的钱很少，还受日本人的气，因为吃不饱，我有时是夜里上班，白天到跑马场去卖票。有一次，卖完票回来时到车站上一看，火车被日本人占满了，没法再挤上去，这时有一个中国人说：“他妈的拿车治人！”给日本人听见了，就将所有等车的人带到西郊去，用上着刺刀的枪逼着胸膛问是谁说的？没有一个人敢作声，大伙哀求了半天才放我们回来。”她说：“帝国主义都是一样的，今天美帝又来侵略我们，我们要拿出所有的力量来抗拒它，我要在任何情况下都坚持工作”。一向不爱说话的王文虎同志上台只说了一句：“你们知道我父亲母亲怎么死的吗？”眼泪就像泉水似的涌出来了，大伙儿也随着哭了。她抑止着自己接着说：“我父亲原来在京华美术学院教画，一天晚上来了两个日本兵，什么也没说就将我父亲带走了，我和母亲、姐姐、弟弟四个人也被看起来，不许出门一步。后来日本兵对母亲说，拿金条可将父亲赎出来。于是母亲将结婚时的东西全部变卖，带了姐姐跟着日本兵及警察去赎父亲。家里留下我和小弟弟一直等到第二天晚上，母亲与姐姐才回来，但是连我父亲的影子都没有，原来我们受骗了！”大家听了气的哭的更厉害了。她流着泪咬着嘴说：“我们从此再也见不到父亲了，后来母亲也急疯了！”她哭的说不下去了，悲痛把大家压得抬不起头来，最后她说：“我过去没有哭过，我没有眼泪了，我从一懂事就有了恨，我从小就想，只要我有一口气，就要给父亲母亲报仇！”人们喊着：“我们只要活着一天，就要和美国帝国主义拼一天，我们不哭，把眼泪变成子弹，把悲愤化为力量，在工作中去报仇！”
