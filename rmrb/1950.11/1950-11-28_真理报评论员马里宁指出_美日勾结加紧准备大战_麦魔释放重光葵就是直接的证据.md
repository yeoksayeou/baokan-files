　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 27th. TASS, Moscow dispatch: Commentator Malinin wrote in Pravda on the 26th, commenting on Japan's continuous intensification of rearmament: The re-militarization of Japan is being carried out at a faster speed and on a larger scale. Japan's re-militarization, like that of West Germany, is being carried out in three aspects: economic, military, and political.

　　As soon as MacArthur's staff arrived in Japan, they immediately began to restore Japan's heavy industry with the help of American monopoly capitalists. The so-called list of prohibited factories (i.e., enterprises that manufacture war materials) has now become completely a waste of paper. The vast majority of these factories have been removed from these lists, and the few factories that are still on the lists are receiving large numbers of military orders from the American authorities.

　　At the same time, under the protection of the occupation authorities, many semi-military groups have appeared in Japan under the guise of sports groups and other groups. However, MacArthur was not satisfied with this. He also announced the establishment of the so-called Police Reserve Force, and everyone knows that this is the core of the revived Japanese army. At the same time, reporters from several American newspapers confirmed that Japanese soldiers actively participated in the American aggression against the Korean people.

　　Malinin further pointed out that the political situation created by MacArthur in Japan is completely in line with his policy of restoring Japanese militarism. The characteristic of this situation is the persecution of all democrats by the most severe means and the establishment of fascist rule in the country. There is obviously an understanding between the militarists of the United States and Japan. There is now direct evidence of the actual collusion between MacArthur and Shigemitsu Mamoru, a major war criminal. Despite the judgment of the International Military Tribunal, MacArthur actually released Shigemitsu Mamoru from prison. MacArthur and his ilk's implementation of Japan's re-militarization is intensifying preparations to ignite the flames of a new world war. The commentator emphasized: But now it is not 1936 but 1950. Japan's true democratic forces are developing and growing. Six million people in Japan have signed the Stockholm Appeal. The Japanese people are advancing, and they are fighting for a peace-loving, democratic new Japan. In this noble cause, they are supported by all peace-loving nations.

### 真理报评论员马里宁指出  美日勾结加紧准备大战  麦魔释放重光葵就是直接的证据

　　真理报评论员马里宁指出
    美日勾结加紧准备大战
    麦魔释放重光葵就是直接的证据
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：评论员马里宁二十六日在真理报上评论日本不断加紧重新军事化时写道：日本的重新军事化正在以更快的速度和更大的规模实行中。日本的重新军事化正如西德一样，是在经济、军事和政治三方面进行的。
    麦克阿瑟的参谋人员一到日本，就立即在美国垄断资本家的帮助下，着手恢复日本重工业的工作。所谓被查禁的工厂（即制造战争物资的企业）的名单，现在已完全成了一张废纸。这些工厂中极大多数已经从这些名单上勾销，现在仍旧在名单上的少数工厂，则正从美国当局获得大量的军事订货。
    同时，在占领当局的保护下，许多半军事性质的团体，打着体育团体和其他团体的招牌，已在日本出现。但是，麦克阿瑟并不这样就满足了。他还宣布建立所谓警察后备队，大家都知道，这是复活了的日本军队的核心。同时，美国若干报纸的记者证实：日本军人积极参加了美国对朝鲜人民的侵略。
    马里宁进一步指出：麦克阿瑟在日本所造成的政治局势，完全符合于他所推行的恢复日本军国主义的政策。这个局势的特征就是以最严厉的手段迫害一切民主人士，并在该国建立法西斯统治。美日两国的军国主义者显然有了一种谅解。麦克阿瑟与重光葵这个主要战犯间的实际上的勾结，现在有了直接的证据。尽管有国际军事法庭的判决，麦克阿瑟竟把重光葵从监狱里释放出来。麦克阿瑟之流实施日本的重新军事化，就是在加紧准备燃烧起新世界大战的火焰。评论员着重指出：但是，现在不是一九三六年而是一九五○年了。日本的真正民主力量正在发展和壮大。日本有六百万人在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。日本人民在前进，他们正为爱好和平的、民主的新日本而斗争。在这个崇高的事业中，他们得到所有爱好和平民族的支持。
