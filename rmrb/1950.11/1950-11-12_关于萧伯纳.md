About George Bernard Shaw
By Xia Biruo, translated by Lu Muran

George Bernard Shaw, a playwright and satirist, died this week at the age of ninety-four after an operation for a broken femur. He was a very contradictory man. With his sharp satire and dramatic exposure of social evils, he inspired and shook several generations; but the conclusions he brought to people blurred and dulled efforts to resolve these evils through the only revolutionary method. Lenin's incisive description of him as "a good old man who fell into the ranks of the Fabians" is entirely appropriate.

According to Lenin's analysis, a Fabian is someone who attempts to deny the class struggle and divert the revolutionary momentum of the masses into the narrow struggle for minor reforms, regarding this as the be-all and end-all of combat action. Shaw's *Fabian Essays*, written with great skill, is consistent with the above attitude; so is his *The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism*, in which he devoted a large amount of space and all the talent his versatile pen could muster to useless debates...

He wrote a large number of plays, and according to their format, we see that he prefaced each with long essays, almost every sentence of which was an epigram, talking about everything in the world. These plays show his keen understanding of the cruelty and hypocrisy of capitalist society. His moving prose *The Adventures of the Black Girl in Her Search for God* is an incisive exposure of many aspects of imperialism and colonial rule. However, his Fabianism prevented him from recognizing the power of the working class—and only this power can eliminate capitalism.

Therefore, Shaw often mistakenly failed to make people think, struggle, and revolutionize more deeply. Nevertheless, almost even against his own intentions, the real contradictions existing in capitalist society, the anti-capitalist struggle, and the genuine yearning for socialism, erupted time and time again; because in his own way, Shaw was not a mere purveyor of pleasantries of social democracy, but a fighter.

At the age of seventy-five, after visiting the Soviet Union in 1931, he wrote something called *Look, You Boobies!*, giving a severe and sharp blow to those stupid fellows who pretended to turn a deaf ear to the new forces of progress that the Soviet Union had become. He held a strong affection for Stalin, whom he had met during his visit to the Soviet Union.

It is true that there were many times when he went astray; his praise of Mussolini was one such instance. Also, for a period, he allowed himself to become involved with the notorious Astor family, closely connected with the Munich era. His own bourgeois background, his Fabianism, and even his position as a wealthy man, all severely hindered his wit and awareness. But when the Communist Party and the *Daily Worker* were under attack in certain moments of crisis, he stood up and spoke out in his usual, sharp satirical style, which was helpful to these movements. He was one of the earliest members of the "Daily Worker Cooperative," which was set up to raise funds for the newspaper. When the cooperative was established, he took out two hundred pounds of shares, the largest of any individual shareholder.

His plays are very popular in the Soviet Union, where they have been translated and published many times. Hardly a season goes by without several of his plays being staged. Indeed, it can be said that the powerful fighting nature fully expressed in his works and personality can only be fully appreciated in a socialist society, only by truly progressive people.

### 关于萧伯纳

　　关于萧伯纳
    夏庇若作　鲁沕然译
    乔治·伯纳·萧，一个剧作家和讽刺家，本周内因股折动手术后逝世，时年九十四岁。他是一个非常矛盾的人。用他的尖利的讽刺和对社会丑恶的戏剧性的暴露，他鼓舞震动了好几个世代；但他带给人们的结论却迷糊钝化了用唯一的革命方法解决这些丑恶的努力方向。列宁精辟地描绘他为“一个掉在费边主义者群中的老好人”，对他是完全妥贴的。
    照列宁的分析，费边主义者就是这样一个人，他试图否认阶级斗争而将群众革命动力转向于次要改革的狭隘斗争中去，并把这看作战斗行动的一切和最后目的。有着高度写作技巧的萧伯纳的《费边主义论文》与上述态度是一致的；他的《知识妇女社会主义指南》亦复如是，在该书中，他用大量的篇幅和他的多才的笔所能施展出来的全部才华，花费在无益的争辩上……
    他写了一大堆剧本，根据它们的版式，我们看到了他在每本的前面都序有很长的论文，差不多每一句都是警句，谈到世界上每一种事情。这些剧本显示出他对资本主义社会的残酷和虚伪，有敏锐的领悟。他的动人的散文《黑女求神记》就是对于帝国主义和殖民统治的许多方面的痛切暴露。但是，他的费边主义却阻止了他去认识工人阶级的力量——而唯有这力量是能够结果掉资本主义的。
    所以萧伯纳经常错误地不使人民更深入地思考，斗争和革命。虽然如此，几乎连他自己也想不到，资本主义社会中存在着的真正的矛盾，反资本主义的斗争以及对社会主义的真正向往，却一次又一次地爆发了；因为按他自己的方式，萧伯纳不是一个光说好听话的社会民主党人，而是一个斗士。
    他在七十五岁的时候，在一九三一年访问苏联之后，写了一篇叫做《瞧吧，书呆子们！》的东西，给那些对苏联已经变成了伟大的要求进步的新的力量故作充耳不闻的蠢家伙们以严峻锋利的打击。他对在访苏时会见过的斯大林怀着强烈的爱。
    有很多时候，他走入了歧途，这样说，也是真实的，他称颂过莫索里尼就算是其中的一次。还有，他允许自己有一个时期被卷入与慕尼黑时代恶名彰著的奥斯多尔族系有密切的连系。他自己的布尔乔亚的背景，他的费边主义乃至他的作为一个大富翁的立场，在在都成为他的机智和觉悟的严重障碍。但当共产党和《工人日报》受着攻击的某些危难关头，他就站了出来用他的惯常的、锐利的讽刺诗体式的言词发言，这对于这些运动是有帮助的。他是“工人日报合作社”最早的社员之一，该社是为了该报筹谋基金而设置的。在合作社成立时，他拿出二百镑股份，是个人股东中最多的一个。
    他的剧本在苏联流行很广，在那里，人们将之翻译出版了多次。差不多每季都要上演他写的几出戏才能过得去。真的，这样说是可以的；在他的作品和人格中所充分表现着的有力的战斗性质，只有在一个社会主义社会里，只有真正进步的人民，才能充分加以评价。
