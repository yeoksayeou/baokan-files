　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 20th—Industrial and agricultural labor models from the Northeast region, who attended the National Labor Model Representative Conference, are now active leaders in patriotic production competitions and various voluntary activities to resist US aggression and aid Korea in various localities. In late October, Zhao Guoyou, a labor model from the Northeast No. 3 Machine Factory, took the lead in initiating a large-scale production competition among industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China. Currently, hundreds of factories and mines are participating in this competition. Liu Maoyou and Wang Zhaoda, industrial labor models from Dalian, have become central figures in the patriotic production competition in Dalian. More than a hundred units or individuals have challenged or accepted challenges from them. In the glass factory where Liu Maoyou works, employees are striving to extend the life of the melting furnace, ensuring it won't need repair this year, while increasing melting efficiency by 20 percent and labor efficiency by 10 percent. Under Wang Zhaoda's promotion, the No. 1 workshop of Guanghe Machinery Factory has exceeded its October production plan by 20 percent, and the production efficiency of Wang Zhaoda's group has increased by more than 44 percent compared to before. Nie Zhongyi, the creator of the new record in the wooden boiler room of Andong Paper Mill, took the lead in encouraging workers to persevere in their work under constant US air raids and improved product quality by 8 percent. Recently, the boiler room proposed to all factories and mines in Andong: resolutely fulfill production tasks under any circumstances to respond to the aggressive atrocities of US imperialism.
　　
　　Xiu Longqi, a labor model from the Harbin Private Xingdong Oil Company, mobilized all workers in the factory to challenge all employees of private enterprises in Northeast China to unite with capitalists and actively engage in production. Currently, all eleven production groups in the factory have formulated specific plans.
　　
　　Agricultural labor models in various localities have also actively carried out current affairs propaganda among farmers, mobilized farmers to step up production, and select good public grain to enrich national defense forces. Under the mobilization of labor model Han En, farmers in Baoantun Village, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, had already selected good public grain during threshing. The remaining 58,000 jin of grain in the village this year, except for a portion invested in the cooperative, was used to purchase vehicles and horses to expand production. Under the leadership of water conservancy model Zou Yun, farmers in Angbangniu Village, Xinmin County, Liaoxi Province, have generally selected public grain three or four times to ensure that the best grain is handed over to the state. Gao Fengzhi, a labor model from Liuhe Village, Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, not only actively led farmers in threshing, selecting good public grain, and developing sideline production, but also selected an additional 200 jin of good grain to dedicate to the state.

　　东北工业农业劳动模范
    带领群众积极生产
    并在各种抗美援朝志愿活动中发挥带头作用
    【新华社沈阳二十日电】东北区出席全国劳动模范代表会议归来的工农业劳动模范，现在是各地爱国主义生产竞赛和各种抗美援朝志愿活动的积极带头者。十月下旬，东北第三机器厂劳动模范赵国有首先挑起了东北工矿企业的生产大竞赛；目前参加这一竞赛的厂矿已有数百个单位。旅大市工业劳动模范刘茂有和王兆达已成为旅大市爱国主义生产竞赛的中心人物，现有百余单位或个人向他们进行了挑战和应战。在刘茂有服务的玻璃厂中，职工们正向延长溶化大窑寿命、保证今年不修、并使溶化效率提高百分之二十、劳动效率提高百分之十的竞赛目标努力前进。广和机械厂在王兆达的推动下，第一车间部已超过十月份生产计划百分之二十，而王兆达小组的生产效率则较前提高百分之四十四以上。安东造纸厂木釜室新纪录创造者聂忠义，在美国飞机不断侵袭下，带头推动工人坚持工作，并提高了产品质量百分之八。最近该室又向全安东市各厂矿提出：在任何情况下坚决完成生产任务，以回答美国帝国主义的侵略暴行。
    哈尔滨市私营兴东制油公司劳动模范修龙起发动全厂工人，向全东北私营企业职工提出团结资方积极生产的挑战。现该厂十一个生产小组都已订出具体计划。
    各地农业劳动模范在农民中也积极展开了时事宣传工作，并发动农民加紧生产，选好公粮，以充实国防力量。吉林省蛟河县保安屯农民在劳动模范韩恩的动员下，打场中即已选好公粮。全屯今年剩余的五万八千斤粮食，除一部分投入合作社外，其余均用以添买车马，扩大生产。辽西省新民县昂邦牛村农民，在水利模范邹云带动下，公粮已普遍挑选过三、四遍，切实做到以最好粮食缴给国家。黑龙江省绥化县六合村劳动模范高凤志，不但积极领导农民打场，选好公粮，开展副业生产，自己还多选出二百斤好粮准备献给国家。
