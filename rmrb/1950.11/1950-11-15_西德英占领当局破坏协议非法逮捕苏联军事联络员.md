Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 11th (TASS): Recently, Mikhailov and Yeshov, personnel of the Soviet Military Liaison Group responsible for liaison with the Supreme Commander of the British occupation forces, were detained and arrested without reason in the British occupation zone of Germany.

The detention and arrest of personnel from the Soviet Military Liaison Group constitutes a blatant violation by the British occupation authorities of the agreement concluded in 1945 by the Soviet, American, British, and French governments regarding the control mechanism in Germany, which stipulated the establishment of military liaison groups to carry out liaison work; moreover, this action also blatantly violates the agreement concluded between the Soviet and British headquarters in Germany on September 16, 1946, regarding military liaison groups.

The head of the Soviet Military Liaison Group, Stepanov, has lodged a firm protest with the British military authorities regarding the aforementioned illegal actions against the two Soviet military liaison group personnel and demanded strict adherence to the existing agreement regarding military liaison groups.

The head of the British Military Liaison Group, Cardew, had to admit that the British authorities illegally detained Soviet military liaison group personnel and expressed regret and offered an apology for this incident. Cardew also said that all those who participated in the detention of the Soviet military liaison officers would be punished and guaranteed that the agreement regarding military liaison groups would be strictly observed in the future.

　　西德英占领当局破坏协议非法逮捕苏联军事联络员
    【新华社讯】塔斯社柏林十一日电：担任与英国占领军最高司令官进行联络工作的苏联军事联络组人员米哈拉耶夫和叶硕夫最近在德境英占区被毫无理由地拘留与逮捕。
    苏联军事联络组人员的被拘留与逮捕乃是英国占领当局方面粗暴地破坏苏、美、英、法政府于一九四五年所缔结的关于对德管制机构的协议，这项协议规定成立军事联络组，执行联络工作；而且这一行动也粗暴地破坏了一九四六年九月十六日苏、英驻德司令部之间所缔结的关于军事联络组的协议。
    苏联军事联络组组长斯捷潘诺夫已就上述对苏联两军事联络组人员的非法行动，向英国军事当局提出坚决抗议，并要求严格遵守关于军事联络组的现存协议。
    英国军事联络组组长卡杜不得不承认英国当局非法拘留苏联军事联络组人员，并就这一事件表示遗憾和提出道歉。卡杜并且说，所有参加拘留苏联军事联络员的人都将受到惩处，并保证将来严格遵守关于军事联络组的协议。
