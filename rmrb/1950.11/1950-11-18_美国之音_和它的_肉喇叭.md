“Voice of America” and its "Meat Trumpets"

　　If someone uses a refined phrase like "human head making animal sounds," or a vulgar one like "farting," to compare to the "Voice of America," that would be quite generous. Because no "animal," including the vicious jackal and the cunning fox, and no "fart," including human farts and dog farts, contain as much malice and shamelessness as the "Voice of America"; nor does any spread such unimaginable slander, deception, and intimidation against the people throughout the world in various "languages" as widely as the "Voice of America."

　　However, in today's China, there are still people who say that not listening to the "Voice of America" makes it impossible to have a comparative perspective on issues, and one will not be "objective." In order to extend this "objectivity" to others, these people broadcast it everywhere, becoming active "meat trumpets" for broadcasting the "Voice of America."

　　Where is the "objectivity" of the "Voice of America"? The robbers who drop thousands of tons of bombs on innocent women and children are portrayed as benefactors promoting the gospel of "democracy" and "freedom," while the people forced to defend themselves are called "aggressors." Even the Chinese people liberating their own territory of Tibet is called an "invasion." Black is white, that is the "objectivity" of the "Voice of America"!

　　The "meat trumpets" argue: we listen to the "Voice of America" not to hear these "opinions," but to learn more news.

　　What real news will the "Voice of America" tell you? The huge casualty figures of the American robbers in Korea are greatly discounted. Haven't even Americans and French said it's unreliable? What beneficial news for the people will the "Voice of America" provide? To boast of the robbers' "power," it broadcasts every day about destroying "military targets" (actually women, children and the elderly!) while dropping thousands upon thousands of tons of bombs. To paralyze and deceive the Chinese people, it spreads a gigantic lie every day about how the American robbers' behavior will "know when to stop," a promise that has never been fulfilled even in the slightest. "Meat trumpets," what do you mean by listening to and spreading these "messages"? What purpose are you trying to achieve?

　　If it is truly not out of hostility to the motherland, then the essence of these "objectivity" advocates is: disbelief in the truth of the people, and no hatred for the enemy's poison. That is: a lack of love for the motherland. According to the Common Program's provisions on national morality, these people are violating the public morality of being a Chinese person today.

　　If they are truly not agents of Wall Street, then these "meat trumpets" have at least objectively become tools of Truman and MacArthur—volunteer propagandists. Due to the long-term cultural aggression of American imperialism in China, certain intellectuals have emerged who are consciously or unconsciously captured and poisoned in spirit. These people still call themselves "objective," but in reality, they at least prove that their spirit lacks resistance; frankly speaking, they are weak and incompetent. Here, we have not even discussed the crimes they should be held accountable for to the motherland and the people for spreading imperialist poison!

　　The "Voice of America" will eventually prove that it is just the last poisonous sting before imperialism dies. Our current task is to more quickly eliminate this shameful "foreign" voice, and a meaningful step in that direction is to prevent it from releasing poison from radios in our country again. Furthermore, while stopping the activities of the machine trumpet, we must also stop the activities of the "meat trumpets." Everyone, and the "meat trumpets" themselves, must understand that they are committing an act that is disloyal and shameful to the motherland and the people.

### “美国之音”和它的“肉喇叭”

　　“美国之音”和它的“肉喇叭”
    如果有人用一句文雅的话，就是“人头而作畜鸣”，或者用一句不文雅的话，就是“放屁”，来比拟“美国之音”，那都是十分厚道的了。因为任何一种“畜”，包括狠毒的豺狼和狡猾的狐狸，任何一种“屁”，包括人屁和狗屁，都没有“美国之音”里所包含那么多的恶毒与无耻；也没有像“美国之音”那样向全世界用各种“语言”这样广泛地散布着对人民的难以想像的诬蔑、欺骗和恐吓。
    然而，在今天的中国，居然还有人说：不听“美国之音”看问题就没有个比较，就会不“客观”。这些人为了把这种“客观”推己及人，就到处转播，成了放送“美国之音”的活动“肉喇叭”。
    “美国之音”的“客观”何在呢？把成千成万吨炸弹丢在无辜妇女儿童头上的强盗被说成推行“民主”“自由”福音的善士，被迫自卫的人民被叫做“侵略者”，甚至连中国人民解放自己的领土西藏，也被叫做“入侵”。黑的就是白的，这就是“美国之音”的“客观”！
    “肉喇叭”辩解道：我们听“美国之音”不是为了听这些“观点”，而是为了多知道点消息。
    “美国之音”会告诉你什么真消息呢？美国强盗在朝鲜的巨大伤亡数字被大打折扣，不是连美国人和法国人也说过不可靠么？“美国之音”又会供给你什么有益人民的消息？为了夸耀强盗的“威势”，它每天广播着摧毁“军事目标”（实际是妇孺老弱！）而丢下成千成万吨的炸弹。为了麻痹欺骗中国人民，它每天散布着从来没有半分兑现的关于美国强盗行为会“适可而止”的弥天大谎。“肉喇叭”们，你们听了而且散布了这些“消息”，是什么意思？是为了达到什么目的？
    如果确非敌视祖国，那么这些“客观”论者的实质，就是：对人民的真理不相信，对敌人的毒素不仇恨。也就是：缺少对祖国的爱。如果照共同纲领关于国民公德的规定，那么这些人就是有背今日中国人为人的公德。
    如果确非华尔街的代理人，那么这些“肉喇叭”至少在客观上已经成为杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟的工具——义务宣传员了。由于美帝国主义长期在中国的文化侵略，已使中国某种知识分子中间出现了某些在精神上自觉或不自觉地被俘虏被毒化的人。这些人还自命“客观”，实际上，至少是证明他精神缺少抵抗力，直率地说，就是孱弱无能。这里，还没有讨论他散布帝国主义毒素对祖国和人民应负的罪衍！
    “美国之音”终将证明他只是帝国主义垂死前最后的一个毒螫。当前我们的任务是更迅速地消灭这可耻的“外来”的声音，而其中有意义的一个步骤，就是不让它再从我们国土上的收音机内放出毒素。并且，与停止机器喇叭活动的同时，必须停止“肉喇叭”的活动。必须让一切人和“肉喇叭”自己，懂得他是做着一件对祖国和人民如何不忠而可耻的行为。
