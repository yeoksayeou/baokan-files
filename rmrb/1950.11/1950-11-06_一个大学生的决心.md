　　A College Student's Determination
    By Our Correspondent Jin Feng

    The sound of the American aggressors' cannons across the Yalu River has shaken the thousands upon thousands of college students who are diligently studying in laboratories and libraries for the construction of New China.

    Yuan Baotong, a student in the Chemical Engineering Department of Tsinghua University, is one of these thousands upon thousands of college students.

    (I) A Youth's Ideal of a Bright Future

    Yuan Baotong is a 19-year-old youth who entered university after liberation. In his own words, he is "fully enjoying the happiness of a youth in the Mao Zedong era." He doesn't feel the terror of being tailed by special agents, blacklisted, or locked up in special criminal courts. He doesn't have to sneak to the toilet in the middle of the night to read "On New Democracy." He won't experience the sorrow of "graduation meaning unemployment." What he has is a youth's aspiration for a bright future. He yearns for the large-scale economic construction of the motherland. He thinks that he is now in his second year, and by the time he graduates, he will be able to participate in the great construction of New China's first Five-Year Plan. Then, he, Yuan Baotong, must, like Soviet youth, throw himself into the heat of work day and night, striving and accelerating to complete the country's construction plan ahead of schedule.

    (II) Studying Behind Closed Doors, Unaware of the Wolf at the Door

    Since the beginning of this semester, Tsinghua University has shown an even more peaceful atmosphere. The reports of students who returned from internships in the Northeast depicted a magnificent vision of New China's industrialization to the entire faculty and students. The school's food has been getting better day by day, and recreational activities have become more active. The National Day celebration on October 1st, the 400,000-strong parade in Tiananmen Square, the powerful review of the people's armed forces – these impressions circulated in Yuan Baotong's mind, and the yearning for peaceful construction became even more ardent. When the sound of the Korean War cannons broke out, he thought it didn't matter, because final victory would surely belong to the Korean people. When the American aggressors landed at Incheon and Seoul fell, he was not very concerned. It wasn't until Pyongyang fell that his calm mood was shaken.

    That day, as he came out of the dining hall, he suddenly saw the words "The Flames of War Have Reached the Border of the Motherland" posted in the corridor, and he was suddenly startled. This was because he usually only cared about studying behind closed doors, forgetting that there was a vicious wolf constantly lurking outside the door. And at that time, Yuan Baotong was not the only one at Tsinghua University who had a sense of "suddenness."

    (III) The Illusion of Peaceful Coexistence with Wolves

    Yuan Baotong could not believe the seriousness of the current situation. He thought: "The disaster-stricken Chinese people have finally established their own country and have their own government. Prices are stable, industry and commerce are beginning to thrive, and this year there has been a national bumper harvest, giving people hope for a good life. Could it be that the newborn infant is about to hear the ominous sound of cannons again? No, we need peace, we need construction." He remembered the five million strong People's Liberation Army and began to feel at ease: "The American imperialists, they wouldn't dare to come." He also thought: "Imperialism is bound to perish, why clash with it prematurely? We should still buy time for construction." Moreover, he thought of a reason to calm himself down: "The Korean people will eventually liberate themselves!"

    (IV) The American Aggressors' Bayonets Pierced His Last Illusion

    With such calmness and peace of mind, Yuan Baotong participated in his class discussion. To his surprise, his views were opposed by almost the entire class. The students analyzed the essence of American imperialism's aggression and its attempt to dominate the world, citing the facts of American imperialism's invasion of Taiwan, its invasion of our territorial waters and airspace, and the strafing of our compatriots by aircraft, which first shook his idea that "the American imperialists wouldn't dare to come." Another student pointed out that his statement "the Korean people will liberate themselves" was essentially an excuse for him to stand idly by while the American imperialists committed aggression. Because people have clearly seen that the American imperialists are following the old path of the Japanese invaders, and invading Korea is part of their plan to invade China. Therefore, our assistance to Korea is also to defend our motherland. A student then said: "The American imperialists' cannons are already pointed at our Northeast."

    Yuan Baotong's thinking wavered. "But, maybe, if people don't offend me, I won't offend them," Yuan Baotong still had his last bit of illusion. He had not yet recognized that American imperialism had a hundred-year history of "offending me," and that in Taiwan, in the Northeast, and in Shandong, it had already used its navy and air force to "offend me." The development of the situation more quickly pushed him to recognize reality. The fact that the American troops invading Korea were approaching the Northeast border finally pierced his last illusion like a bayonet. "Then, it is indeed coming," he thought painfully: "Our Northeast, our Five-Year Plan are all going to..." He blurted out: "I can't bear it!"

    (V) Offering Blood to Defend the Motherland, Our Beautiful Future

    The Tsinghua University-wide rally against American imperialism's aggression on October 29 further educated Yuan Baotong.

    Here, he saw the entire faculty and students' fighting will to resist America and aid Korea. Professor Hua Luogeng, representing the entire faculty, resolutely said: "Now is the time for action!" More than a thousand students from the Electrical Engineering, Civil Engineering, and Construction Departments solemnly swore under the five-star flag: "We are ready to go to the place where the motherland needs us most at any time!" "Yes," Yuan Baotong thought with emotion: "If we can't bear it, we must rise up to defend it – our motherland, our beautiful future!"

    To defend it requires determination and strength. PLA soldier Zhang Mingyuan set a good example for Yuan Baotong. Listening to his steel-like voice, resounding loudly in the auditorium: "If the American imperialists dare to stick their dog heads into an inch of Northeast territory, I will resolutely send the first package of explosives into the American imperialists' bunker for the sake of the motherland and the people!" These words heavily struck Yuan Baotong, and he felt ashamed, feeling that his determination was not enough.

    But, soon, he found strength, which is the hatred for the American aggressors. On the stage appeared the sinister Sino-American Cooperative Organization, the shameless atrocities of the American military – the Shen Chong incident, Truman and MacArthur's conspiracy – three bloody steel knives inserted on the edge of the map of New China, and finally, the ghost of September 18th appeared before Yuan Baotong's eyes. The hatred for American imperialists burned like fire in Yuan Baotong's heart, and he secretly made up his mind: "We must fight it to the death, this man-eating beast."

    And the question raised by that dear Young Pioneer member even more deeply aroused his sense of responsibility as a member of the Communist Youth League. That red-scarved Young Pioneer asked them – all the members of the Communist Youth League in the school – innocently and seriously: "If war comes to us tomorrow, elder brothers and sisters, you, members of the Communist Youth League, can you offer your blood to defend the motherland?" At that moment, Yuan Baotong solemnly felt his own responsibility – a member of the Communist Youth League – in the face of the motherland's crisis. At that time, he didn't have time to think carefully, and he answered loudly with more than a thousand other members of the Communist Youth League in the school: "Yes, we will!" From then on, that red scarf and that innocent and serious gaze were always before his eyes. He knew that he had not only made a promise to this honest and fearless gaze, but he had also made a promise to the beloved motherland.

　　一个大学生的决心
    本报记者金凤
    鸭绿江对岸美国侵略者的炮声，震动了千千万万正在实验室和图书馆里为新中国建设而专心学习的大学生。
    清华大学化工系学生袁保同是这千千万万大学生中间的一个。
    （一）青年美好前途的理想
    袁保同是个十九岁的青年，解放以后进了大学。用他自己的话来说，“正充分享受着毛泽东时代青年的幸福”。他感不到特务钉梢、上黑名单、关到特刑庭的恐怖，他用不到半夜三更偷偷跑到厕所去看《新民主主义论》，他也不会有“毕业即失业”的悲哀。他有的是青年对于美好前途的向往。他向往着祖国大规模的经济建设。他想，他今年读二年级，等到毕业，正好赶上参加新中国第一个五年计划的伟大建设。那末，他，袁保同，一定要像苏联青年一样，日夜卷进工作的热潮，突击，突击，提前完成国家的建设计划。
    （二）闭门读书，没有警惕门外有狼
    这学期开始，清华园更显出一片太平气象。东北实习回来的同学的报告，在全校师生面前描绘出一幅新中国工业化的壮丽远景。学校的伙食吃得一天比一天好了，文娱活动活跃起来。十月一日的国庆节，天安门四十万人大游行，强大的人民武装大检阅——袁保同心里回旋着这些印象，和平建设的向往更炽热起来。朝鲜战争的炮声打响了，他想，这不要紧，反正最后胜利一定属于朝鲜人民。美国侵略者在仁川登陆，汉城沦陷，他还不太关心。直等到平壤失守，他的平静的心情才震荡起来。
    那天，他从饭厅出来，蓦地看到走廊里贴着的几个大字“战火已燃烧到祖国边境”，他突然吃了一惊。这是因为他平时一心只顾闭门读书，竟忘掉门外还有那时时窥伺着的恶狼。而那时在清华大学有“突然”之感的，正不止袁保同一个人。
    （三）和狼和平共居的幻想
    袁保同不能相信目前局势的严重。他想：“灾难深重的中国人民，好容易建立了自己的国家，有了自己的政府。物价稳定了，工商业开始活跃，今年全国丰收，人民有了过好日子的希望。难道，新生的婴孩又要听到那不祥的炮声？不，我们需要和平、需要建设。”他记起五百万强大的人民解放军，开始安心起来：“美帝，他不敢来的。”他又想：“帝国主义必然走向灭亡，何必过早和它冲突。我们还是争取时间建设。”而且，他又想到一条使自己冷静的理由：“朝鲜人民终究会自己解放自己！”
    （四）美国侵略者的刺刀，刺穿了他最后的幻想
    带着这样的冷静和安心，袁保同参加了他们的班讨论会。出乎他意料的，他的意见遭到几乎全班的反对。同学们分析着美帝侵略的本质和它霸占全世界的企图，举出了美帝侵略台湾、侵略我国领海、领空，飞机扫射我国同胞的事实，首先动摇了他的“美帝不敢来”的想法。另一个同学又指出他所说的“朝鲜人民自己解放自己”的说法，实质是作为他对美帝侵略袖手旁观的借口。因为人们已经清楚的看到，美帝正走着日寇的老路，侵略朝鲜就是侵略中国的计划之一。因此，我们援助朝鲜，也就是保卫我们祖国。一个同学紧接着说：“美帝的大炮已对着我们的东北。”
    袁保同的想法动摇了。“但是，也许，人不犯我，我不犯人”，袁保同还有最后的一点幻想。他还没有认清美帝“犯我”已经有一百年的历史，而且在台湾、在东北、在山东，已经用海军、空军在“犯我”了。情势的发展，更快地推动他认清现实。侵朝美军向东北国境逼近的事实，终于像一把刺刀一样，刺穿了他最后的幻想。“那末，它是确实要来的了”，他痛心地想着：“我们的东北，我们的五年计划都将要……”他不觉脱出口来：“我舍不得！”
    （五）献出鲜血，保卫祖国，我们的美好的未来
    十月二十九日，清华全校反对美帝侵略的晚会，进一步教育了袁保同。
    在这里，他看到全校师生抗美援朝的战斗意志。华罗庚教授代表全校教授坚决地说：“现在是行动的时候了！”电机、土木、营建等系一千多同学在五星国旗下庄严宣誓：“随时准备到祖国最需要的地方去！”“对”，袁保同感动地想道：“舍不得就要起来保卫它——我们的祖国，我们美好的未来！”
    保卫它要有决心和力量。解放军战士张明远给袁保同做出了一个好榜样。听他那钢铁般的声音，在大礼堂里朗朗的响着：“美帝胆敢将它的狗头伸进东北一寸领土，我坚决为祖国、为人民往美帝堡垒里送第一包炸药！”这句话重重地捶击着袁保同，他感到惭愧，感到自己的决心不够。
    但是，很快，他找到了力量，这就是对美国侵略者的仇恨。舞台上出现了阴森森的中美合作所，美军无耻暴行——沈崇事件，杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟的阴谋——三把血淋淋的钢刀插在新中国地图的边缘上，最后，九一八的幽灵展现在袁保同的眼前。对美帝国主义者的仇恨像火地燃烧着袁保同的心灵，他暗暗下了决心：必须和它拚命，这吃人的野兽。”
    而那个亲爱的少年儿童队员所提的问题，更深深激发了他青年团员的责任感，那红领巾的少年儿童队员向着他们——全校的青年团员天真而严肃地问道：“假如战争明天来到我们面前，大哥大姐们，你们，青年团员们，能不能献出你们的鲜血保卫祖国？”那一刹那，袁保同肃然感到了自己——一个青年团员在祖国危难面前的责任。那时，他来不及仔细考虑，就和全校一千多青年团员一起高声回答着：“是的，我们要！”从此以后，他眼前时时幌着那红领巾，那天真而严肃的目光。他知道他不仅对于这诚实无畏的目光作了允诺，他也对于亲爱的祖国作了允诺。
