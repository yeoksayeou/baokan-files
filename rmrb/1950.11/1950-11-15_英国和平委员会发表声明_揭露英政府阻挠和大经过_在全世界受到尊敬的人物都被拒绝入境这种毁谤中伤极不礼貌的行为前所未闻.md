Xinhua News Agency, London, November 13th: The British Peace Committee issued a statement at a press conference held in London on the 11th, revealing the detailed process of the British government's obstruction of the Second World Peace Congress being held in Britain. The statement said: The committee wrote to Attlee several weeks ago, hoping that the British authorities would not abuse administrative power to obstruct the peace conference. Attlee stated that he had no legal right to prevent the conference and said that all except "unwelcome" representatives would be allowed entry. However, in reality, the representatives who were refused entry were all figures respected worldwide. The Peace Committee also inquired whether the authorities had any objections to the number of representatives invited, and they indicated that they did not intend to limit the number of representatives. However, the refusal of many representatives, such as the Chinese representatives, did not seem to be based on other criteria. The Peace Committee also asked: Does the refusal of entry to members of the World Peace Congress Preparatory Committee mean that these people are "unwelcome" representatives? The authorities replied: Not necessarily. However, except for one person, all members of the Preparatory Committee have actually been refused entry to Britain.

The statement continued: Member of Parliament Davis, on behalf of the British Peace Committee, submitted a list of 140 members of the Standing Committee to the Home Secretary and asked the authorities to indicate whether they were welcome. However, this request was formally rejected by the authorities. On the 3rd, the committee, according to the Home Office's special request, immediately compiled a list of representatives from various countries that did not require entry visas. However, except for four representatives, all were refused entry. Only two of the 140 members of the Standing Committee were allowed entry, and more than 100 members were simply refused.

The statement pointed out: The British Home Office had previously promised that once a final decision was made, it would announce the list of representatives who were issued and refused entry visas. However, the Home Office did not provide any information in this regard and delayed until the past two days to say that it would not announce it at all. The Home Office also stated that the British Peace Committee could negotiate on behalf of those representatives who were not allowed to enter the country, but it should be done before the representatives returned. However, the situation was exactly the opposite. The Home Office refused to accept the list of representatives stranded in the ports submitted by the British Peace Committee and claimed that unless they had been granted entry, no one could meet with them, and immigration officials would never recognize their contact with them. On the 11th, even the technical personnel of foreign delegations, such as typists and telegraph operators, were turned away. This unprecedented discourteous behavior and fickle attitude of the British authorities, as well as the widespread use of the trick of confusing right and wrong with slander, has created a result that has nothing in common with the characteristics of Britain.

The Peace Committee expressed gratitude to all those who have supported the Peace Congress in the past and present, and confidently called on all British delegates, observers, and vast numbers of peace advocates to help the congress held in Warsaw to be successful.

　　英国和平委员会发表声明
　　揭露英政府阻挠和大经过
    在全世界受到尊敬的人物都被拒绝入境这种毁谤中伤极不礼貌的行为前所未闻
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社伦敦十三日讯：英国和平委员会于十一日在伦敦举行的招待记者会上发表声明，揭露英国政府阻挠第二届世界保卫和平大会在英国举行的详细经过称：委员会曾于数周前致书艾德礼，希望英国当局不要滥用行政权力来阻挠和平大会。艾德礼曾表示在法律上无权阻止大会，并说除“不受欢迎”的代表外，其他一律准许入境。但是实际上被拒绝入境的代表，都是在全世界受到尊敬的人物。和平委员会亦曾询问当局对邀请的代表人数有无异议，他们表示无意限制代表人数。但是实际上许多代表如中国代表的遭受拒绝，又似乎不是根据其他的标准的。和平委员会又曾询问：和大筹备委员会委员被拒绝入境是否意味着这些人是“不受欢迎”的代表？当局的答复是：不见得如此。但是筹备委员会除一人之外实际上已全部被拒绝进入英国。
    声明继称：议员戴维斯曾代表英国和平委员会将常设委员会一百四十位委员的名单提交内政大臣，并要求当局表明他们是否受欢迎。但这个要求却被当局正式拒绝了。委员会于三日又根据内政部的特别要求，立即制订了来自各个无需入境签证的国家的代表名单。但是，除四位代表外亦全部被拒绝入境。常设委员会的一百四十位委员只有两人获准入境，一百名以上的委员却被干脆地拒绝了。
    声明指出：英国内政部前曾允诺，一俟作出最后决定，即可宣布发给与拒发入境签证的代表名单。但是，内政部后来并未提供这方面的消息，一直拖延至前两日才说根本不宣布了。内政部又曾表示，英国和平委员会可以代表那些不准入境的代表办理交涉，但应在代表还未折回以前办理。然而情形恰恰相反，内政部拒绝接受英国和平委员会所提出的停留在港口的各代表名单，并声称：除非他们已获准入境，否则不得接见任何人，移民官员也决不会承认他们与他们接头。十一日，甚至连外国代表团的技术人员如打字员和电务人员等亦被挡回。英国当局这种前所未闻的不礼貌的行为和反复无常的态度，以及把混淆是非与毁谤中伤的伎俩拿来普遍使用，业已造成和英国的特质毫无共同之处的结果。
    和平委员会表示感谢所有过去和现在支持和平大会的人们，并满怀信心地号召英国的全体代表、观察员及广大的和平拥护者，帮助在华沙举行的大会获得成功。
