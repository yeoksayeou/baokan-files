　　To Support the Development of Cooperative Undertakings, the State Bank Should Support Cooperatives; Relevant Departments Have Made a Decision and It Has Been Approved by the Central Financial and Economic Commission
    [Xinhua News Agency] In order to support the development of cooperative undertakings, the Central Cooperative Affairs Administration and the People's Bank of China jointly made the "Decision on the State Bank's Support for Cooperatives." This decision has been approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government. The full text of the decision is as follows:
    1. In order to support the development of cooperative undertakings, the State Bank shall provide various preferential treatments to cooperatives in terms of lending and other businesses; cooperatives should strengthen economic accounting, accept the supervision of the State Bank in terms of financial planning and loan use, and cooperatives should implement the cash management methods stipulated by the State Bank.
    2. Cooperative loan plans and management:
    A. Long-term loans: Cooperative loans with a term of more than one year shall be planned by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives before the beginning of the year, submitted to the Central Financial and Economic Commission for approval, listed as fiscal budget appropriations, and lent through the bank for use according to the plan.
    B. Short-term loans: In addition to preparing annual plans for cooperative loans with a term of less than one year, quarterly loan plans shall also be prepared from bottom to top every quarter, summarized by the All-China Federation of Cooperatives and determined with the consent of the head office of the People's Bank of China. The All-China Federation of Cooperatives shall then prepare specific plans for distribution to large administrative regions or provinces, and the head office and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives shall each issue the distribution plans according to their respective systems. Within the scope of this plan, the lower-level banks and local cooperatives shall negotiate loans at any time according to their needs.
    C. When requesting a loan, the cooperative shall provide a description of the purpose and an operating plan approved by the higher-level authority, and enter into a loan contract. The bank may send personnel at any time to understand the cooperative's business operations and loan usage. The cooperative shall provide various conveniences and assistance for this inspection. If the cooperative needs an overdraft due to special circumstances in its business operations, it shall submit its opinion within the planned loan amount and submit it to the local bank for approval to facilitate the overdraft.
    D. In order to vigorously support the rapid development of cooperatives, the loan interest rate for supply and marketing cooperatives may be reduced by 10% compared to the loan interest rate for state-owned commercial enterprises. The loan interest rate for production cooperatives may be reduced by 10% compared to the loan interest rate for state-owned factories. The deposit interest rate is the same as that for state-owned enterprises.
    E. Cooperative loans shall in principle have collateral and guarantors. If there are practical difficulties, the bank may agree that the higher-level cooperative provide a guarantee, and no further collateral shall be provided; the higher-level cooperative shall be responsible for supervising the lower-level cooperative to fulfill the contract and repay the principal and interest on time.
    3. Cooperatives should thoroughly implement the cash management system and gradually prepare cash revenue and expenditure plans. Cooperatives at all levels and banks at all levels shall enter into various business contracts to stipulate that all activities of cooperatives related to currency and finance shall be conducted through the State Bank. The State Bank shall provide preferential treatment to cooperatives when undertaking these businesses (preferential treatment for deposit and withdrawal interest as mentioned above, remittance fees may be waived, preferential discount on insurance rates, details should be determined by local banks and cooperatives themselves based on local conditions in accordance with this principle).
    4. If the cooperatives in the loan area meet the conditions, the agricultural and sideline product loans controlled by the bank should be handled by the cooperatives as much as possible. When the cooperative acts as an agent for this business, the bank and the cooperative shall agree on a contract in advance and implement it faithfully. Other businesses that the cooperative may be able to handle (such as insurance, savings, etc.) may also be entrusted to the cooperative for agency. All agency businesses shall be contracted, handled in accordance with the contract, and reported to the higher-level bank and cooperative for record.
    5. Cooperatives at all levels should strengthen economic accounting, accumulate and fully and rationally use their own funds, prepare financial plans, and send a copy to the local bank. The State Bank shall provide short-term working capital support under the condition that the cooperative fully and rationally uses its own funds, and supervise the completion of its plan in terms of capital relations.

　　为扶助合作事业发展  国家银行应扶植合作社
    有关部门已作出决定并经中央财委会批准
    【新华社讯】为了扶助合作事业的发展，中央合作事业管理局和中国人民银行共同作出了“关于国家银行扶助合作社的决定”。该决定已经中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会批准。决定全文如下：
    一、为了扶助合作事业的发展，国家银行在放款及其他业务上，要对合作社予以各种优待；合作社则应加强经济核算，接受国家银行在财务计划、贷款使用方面的监督，合作社应执行国家银行所规定的现金管理办法。
    二、合作社贷款计划与掌握：
    甲、长期贷款  期限一年以上的合作贷款，于年度开始前，由全国合作社联合总社拟具计划，呈中财委核准，列为财政预算拨款，经由银行贷给，按计划使用。
    乙、短期贷款  期限一年以下的合作贷款，除编制年度计划外，每季还要自下而上编季度贷款计划，由全国合作社联合总社汇总并得人民银行总行同意确定后，由全国合作社联合总社编制具体分配到大行政区或各省的计划，再经总行与总社各按系统将分配计划下达。在此计划范围内，由下级行与当地的合作社随时根据需要洽谈贷款。
    丙、合作社请求贷款时应提供用途说明及上级批准的经营计划，并订立借款契约。银行随时可以派员了解合作社业务情况及贷款使用情况。合作社对此种检查，应予各种便利和帮助。合作社在业务经营中，如因特殊情形有透支需要，应在计划贷款额内提出意见，交由当地银行呈准，予以透支方式之便利。
    丁、为大力扶助合作社迅速发展，贷款利率供销合作社可比照国营商业贷款利率减低百分之十。生产合作社可比照国营工厂贷款利率减低百分之十。存款利息与国营事业同。
    戊、合作社贷款原则上要有抵押和保证人，如因事实困难经银行同意得由上级社保证，即不再提供抵押品；上级社应负责督促下级社履行合同，如期偿还本息。
    三、合作社应彻底执行现金管理制度，并逐渐编制现金收支计划，各级合作社与各级银行要订立各种业务合同，规定合作社联系到货币金融的各种活动，一律通过国家银行，国家银行在承办这些业务时，应对合作社予以优惠待遇（存放息优待如上述，汇划可免收汇费，保险费率折扣优待，详情应由各地行社，本此原则，根据当地情况自行规定。）
    四、银行掌握的农副业贷款，如贷款地区的合作社具备条件，应尽可能通过合作社代为办理，合作社代理此项业务时，行社双方事先妥订合同，忠实执行。其他业务在合作社有可能办理时（如保险、储蓄等）亦可委托合作社代办，一切代办业务，均订立合同，照合同办事，并报上级行社备查。
    五、各级合作社要加强经济核算，积累和充分合理运用自有资金，编制财务计划并以其副本送当地银行。国家银行在合作社充分合理运用其自有资金条件下，予以短期周转的资金支持，并在资金关系上，监督其计划的完成。
