　　Thälmann Collective Farm
　　·Zhou Libo·
　　In July, the weather in Moscow is very cool, like spring before and after the plum rain season in China. On such a day, July 19th, the Writers' Association invited us to visit a collective farm.
　　Our car drove to the suburbs. The Moscow countryside is a vast plain, with endless green fields of potato seedlings, interspersed with patches of buckwheat's snowy white flowers.
　　The car sped smoothly on the asphalt road. There were five Soviet comrades and eight Chinese comrades in the car. Everyone was chatting happily. The car quickly arrived at the Thälmann Collective Farm in Ramensky District, Moscow Oblast.
　　In the Soviet Union, even in the countryside, people remember Thälmann. This giant was the leader of the German Communist Party before Hitler came to power. He was imprisoned in a concentration camp by the demon Hitler and later died there. To commemorate him, this farm was named after him. A portrait of Thälmann hangs on the wall above the long table in the farm office. He is bald, slightly plump, without a tie, calmly, solemnly, and spiritedly gazing at the world, as if he were still alive. He is alive. All brave people who have died for the communist movement will forever live in people's hearts, encouraging people to move forward tirelessly, forever working and struggling for a better future for mankind.
　　When the car drove into the farm, Chairman Zhitkov came out to meet us. After a warm handshake and brief greetings, he took us to visit. This straightforward reception of immediately leading guests to see what they want to see is a very good reception. The host who knows how to best satisfy the guests' wishes is the most attentive host.
　　We first arrived at the stables. The farm had 259 horses, but at this time, none were at home. Some were working, and some had gone to the pasture to eat grass. There were only two stallions in the stables. One was a white horse, a Russian breed, tall, beautiful, and very clever. It is a riding breed and is eleven years old this year. The other is a breeding horse, with a fat rump and thick legs. It looks like it has a lot of strength. Its offspring will have no problem pulling carts up the mountain or to the city.
　　We then walked to the cowshed. This is a new-style large cowshed with electric lights, running water, glass windows, an automatic cart for transporting cow dung, and an automatic drinking trough for the cows, installed in front of each cow. This is a small iron trough with an iron piece in the middle held up by a spring. If the cow is thirsty, it lowers its head, presses the iron piece with its mouth, and the water is forced out, rising into the trough from the gaps where the iron piece does not completely seal. In this way, the cow quenches its thirst with its own mouth, without any human intervention.
　　The farm feeds five hundred cows. If each cow needed someone to accompany it to drink water, how much manpower would that take? Now, the cows use their own mouths and do not need any human supervision.
　　Milking is also done by machine instead of by hand. A small copper tube is placed on the cow's teat, using the suction of the tube to draw milk down, passing it through a rubber tube and into a milk bucket. It is said that this type of tube, which sucks very evenly, is more comfortable for the cow than hand-milking. In socialist society, even cows are enjoying the good life.
　　Among the five hundred cows, there are two hundred dairy cows. Last year, each dairy cow produced 4,470 kilograms of milk. If the fodder is good, each cow can produce 5,000 kilograms of milk.
　　The cows have gone to pasture. The cowshed is swept clean. There is not a single piece of dung or grass on the floor of each small room. Two rows of glass windows on both sides allow air to circulate when opened, and there is plenty of light. On sunny days, sunlight can shine into the room. The hygiene of the cows is taken very seriously. The farm has two animal technicians who graduated from agricultural universities and are specially responsible for the diet, hygiene, and other aspects of the lives of these cows and other livestock.
　　In the cowshed, each small room is tied to a cow. A sign is nailed to the horizontal beam of the small room, with the cow's name written on it, recording its weight, when it was born, and when it had offspring. Everything is clearly recorded on the sign.
　　We also visited the very clean pigsty. The pigs were sleeping. There are 344 pigs here, including fifty sows. The farm delivers fifteen tons of pork to the state every year, ten tons are used by the public canteen, and the rest is sold to the city.
　　The pigs are very fat, weighing more than two hundred kilograms each. The breeding pigs weigh two hundred and fifty kilograms, and when they sleep in the pen, they look like small white cows.
　　We also looked at the chicken coop. There are a thousand chickens here. There are five hundred hens, and each chicken can lay one hundred and twenty-five eggs a year.
　　The farm has nine large trucks and a tractor. During the busy farming season, it also rents from the tractor station.
　　The farm has 2,207 hectares of land, half of which is planted each year, and the other half is left fallow.
　　The farm has 2,060 people, with 860 laborers, who are the official collective farm peasants.
　　There are three main power lines leading to the farm. A large amount of electricity is used here. Stalin has realized Lenin's electrification plan, and most of the countryside has been electrified. Many of the farm's labors are mechanized and electrified. Plowing and threshing are done using electricity, and other tasks such as milking and hatching chicks are also done with electricity. Every household has electric lights and a radio. The relatively recently invented radio facsimile equipment is also available here. After the peasants finish their work, they can sit in front of the facsimile machine and see and hear the ballet or opera being performed in Moscow that evening.
　　In terms of electrification and mechanization, the Soviet countryside is not much different from the city. Facilities for education and culture are also complete. The collective farm's elementary school and middle school not only train the children of their own farm but also enroll the children of workers and peasants from other farms and nearby factories. The elementary school has 146 students. The middle school has 348 students. In addition to those who work on their own farm, more than two hundred young people from the farms are working in universities and research institutes doing research and other work.
　　There is a state-run hospital here, as well as a library. To allow people to enjoy themselves during their rest, the farm has, in addition to the radio facsimile equipment, a cinema, a piano, an amateur orchestra, and a singing team. The people who lead them are musicians from Moscow. In addition to appreciating the art of their own farm, the peasants often go to the city to see plays during the slack season. Last winter, they went to Moscow to see plays eighty times.
　　The Soviet working people know how to appreciate art, improve themselves, and entertain themselves. They also know how to work and how to fulfill their responsibilities to the country. They all deeply appreciate Stalin's words: "A beautiful life cannot be obtained out of thin air." They all work hard and try to exceed the prescribed tasks. The Thälmann Collective Farm has already completed its annual plan for meat, milk, and wool in the first half of this year.
　　During work hours, the men, women, old, and young on the farm work doubly hard. Thirty-two dairy cows only need four women to manage. Due to their excellent labor, there are eight labor heroes here, and more than thirty people have received certificates and bonuses. Animal technician Yefa Jianlinna has also been awarded the title of labor hero. She graduated from the Moscow Agricultural University and has been working on this farm since 1943. She carefully studies the livestock feed. The farm has 480 hectares of grassland and 334 pastures. In the summer, the livestock graze in the pastures, allowing them to feast on green grass, grow fat and strong, and the dairy cows can produce more milk. People also store the green grass harvested in the summer in cellars, each cellar storing one hundred tons. This grass is used to feed the cows in the winter, which can also increase the milk production of the dairy cows.
　　Yefa Jianlinna advocates using various different things to feed the cows. She uses green grass, hay, canned grass, purple radishes, cucumbers, potatoes, and cabbage as livestock feed, and sometimes even sunflower seeds. She sets the standard for feed based on the amount of food each cow eats, feeding them four times a day and night.
　　Due to Yefa Jianlinna's research and advocacy, and also due to the efforts of all the breeders, the farm produces abundant milk. In addition to handing it over to the public, each member who exceeds the work task has an income of four tons of milk per year. And the Thälmann Collective Farm's total income has increased from 1.5 million rubles to 3.2 million rubles per year.
　　Only the close combination of labor and intelligence can create the prosperity of a collective farm. Stalin's Five-Year Plan has cultivated all kinds of construction talents. The farm itself has experts in all aspects of agriculture and animal husbandry. There are two animal technicians, two agronomists, one Michurin scholar, as well as three blacksmiths and seven carpenters, one car repairman, twelve coachmen, and seven tractor drivers. In addition, in order to improve technology and strengthen the connection between theory and practice, the collective farm has close relations with two research institutes. Academicians and professors from the research institutes often come here to give lectures, introduce new experiences, and help the farm cultivate new scientific cadres.
　　The collective farm economy is a huge economy and must be planned. The state has an overall plan for the collective farms. Based on the state's overall production plan, the Thälmann Collective Farm's seventeen work teams each have their own plans. The work on the farm is very intense, and competitions are held between the teams. Preparations for winter, as well as spring plowing, summer weeding, and autumn harvesting, are all held in competitions. Each team has its own fixed land, farming tools, and livestock. Their harvest determines their income. The farm calculates how much harvest each member should have based on their workdays. After the things to be harvested for the workdays are handed over to the state according to a certain ratio, the rest is the member's own pure income.
　　As early as 1933, the Soviet Union had already raised the living standards of poor peasants to the level of middle peasants. At that time, Stalin said, "This is of course very good, but it is not enough." It is also necessary to "turn all collective farmers into people with abundant lives."
　　Stalin's words have long been realized. The great Stalin has always done what he said he would do. All collective farmers have become people with abundant lives. We already know that the collective farm has all the modern equipment needed to satisfy an abundant life. Now, farm chairman Zhitkov is leading us to see the peasants' residences. This farm has a total of 525 detached houses. These are sturdy and beautiful wooden houses with glass windows all around. The houses are surrounded by vegetable gardens or flower gardens. Each farm family has 0.3 acres of land near their residence for private use, where they plant the vegetables they particularly love or cultivate various flowers and fruits.
　　When we visited, the young and middle-aged men and women had all gone to the fields to dig potatoes, leaving only the elderly and children who could not work at home to look after the houses. Several families invited us in. The houses were all very bright, clean, and spacious. Each member of the family could have their own bedroom, in addition to a dining room and a kitchen. The beds in the bedrooms were covered with clean white sheets and soft pillows. The walls were hung with portraits of leaders, and some were decorated with tapestries. Every household had bright potted flowers on the windowsills.
　　Comrade Zhitkov told us that each family owns its own dairy cow. In a famous speech in 1933, Stalin promised the female collective farmers, "We Bolsheviks must find a way to ensure that every family of our collective farmers has a dairy cow." This plan has also been realized long ago. Now, every collective farmer can use the fresh milk squeezed from their own cow to feed their children and supply the whole family for drinking.
　　Every peasant knows that happiness is not easy to come by. Soviet workers have prepared excellent new machines for the peasants, and the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) has strengthened the leadership in all aspects of the farms in accordance with Stalin's brilliant instructions, and strengthened the sense of responsibility of Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members in the collective farms, which has enabled the peasants to obtain today's happy life. The Party's leadership runs through all the work of the farm. The Party and the Communist Youth League constantly guide the cultivation work of each work team through wall newspapers, small newspapers, and meetings. The Party also leads the peasants to better use machines and tractors and better improve the cultivation of land in accordance with Stalin's instructions.
　　The strength of the Party's leadership is the key to the size of the farm's achievements. Comrade Zhitkov himself is an experienced organizer. He was born in 1909 and did not attend university. He participated in the glorious Battle of Stalingrad, lived in a junior party school, and served as a district party secretary, district party member, and a delegate to the oblast soviet. In 1947, he became the chairman of this farm. His clothing is very simple, and he is dignified and serious. His eyes and his conversation reveal that he is a shrewd and capable person. He naturally also received medals, and is naturally a brave warrior, but he did not mention his own merits in the war. He only told us that during the war against Hitler, 250 young peasants from this farm went to the front, of whom 120 died heroically. The Thälmann Farm, like other collective farms in the Soviet Union, is a heroic farm. They have paid a heavy price for their own happiness and the happiness of mankind. After retiring from the army, many former machine gunners, tank drivers, and aircraft pilots are driving trucks and tractors here, diligently and practically engaged in peaceful labor, creating today's happy life.
　　However, the collective farmers' hard work in the fields is not only for today's happy life, but also for tomorrow's beautiful ideal. Their highly efficient labor today is not only for the prosperity of the Soviet Union, but also for world peace. All adults on the farm have signed the peace declaration, and they have sworn to use their labor to enhance national strength and consolidate peace.
　　The Thälmann Farm, in the Soviet Union, is just a medium-sized collective farm, but it has already given us an impression of abundance and prosperity. We watched all the places with satisfaction. The weather was very good. Comrade Zhitkov accompanied us by car to tour the vast and boundless farmland. The car drove slowly between the white flowers of buckwheat and the green seedlings of potatoes. We saw in the distance groups of strong women with colorful headscarves tied on their heads, bending over and digging potatoes in the fields. We remembered Stalin's words in a speech: "Women are a huge force in the collective farm."
　　We each picked a few buckwheat flowers and put them in the upper pocket of our coats and returned to Moscow. Buckwheat flowers are easy to wilt after being picked, but we still like them because they are not empty flowers that do not bear fruit.
　　We brought the good impressions of the collective farm back to our own country. The Soviet collective farm's today is our vast countryside's tomorrow. The Soviet experience in agricultural collectivization can prevent us from taking detours in tomorrow's collectivization movement. But in order to realize the hope of tomorrow, we still have much work to do. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, we must be ten thousand times vigilant in defending the territory of the motherland, liberating Taiwan and Tibet, completing the national land reform, and also diligently engage in construction in all aspects, mainly industrial construction and cooperative construction, to create the necessary conditions for agricultural collectivization, and to pave the way for the brilliant tomorrow of hundreds of millions of peasants.

　　泰尔曼集体农场
    ·周立波·
    七月里，莫斯科的天气很凉爽，好像是中国梅雨前后的春天。就在这样的一天，七月十九日，作家协会邀我们去参观集体农场。
    我们的车子向郊外驶去，莫斯科的郊野是一片广阔的平原，一望无涯的绿油油的地面，都是土豆苗，其中也点缀着一片一片荞麦的雪白的花朵。
    汽车在柏油路上平稳的奔驰。车上有五个苏联同志和八个中国同志。大家都愉快的谈笑着，车子很快到了莫斯科州、拉明斯基区的泰尔曼集体农场。
    在苏联，就是农村里，也都记得泰尔曼。这位巨人，在希特勒执政之前，是德国共产党领袖。他被希魔关进集中营，后来牺牲在里面。为了纪念他，这个农场用了他的名字作名字。农场办公室的长桌之前的墙壁上，挂着泰尔曼的遗像，他光着头，身体微胖，没有打领带，平静，庄严，而且精神焕发的凝视着人间，好像是他还活着一样。他是活着的，一切为了共产主义运动而殉难的勇敢的人，都将永远的活在人们的心里，鼓舞着人永远不息地前进，永远地为了人类美好的未来而进行不停不息的工作和斗争。
    车子开进农场时，主席日得可夫同志出来接我们，热烈的握手和简短的寒暄之后，他就带我们去参观。这种马上引着客人去看要看的东西的直截了当的招待，是很好的招待，知道怎样最好的满足客人心愿的主人，是最殷勤的主人。
    我们首先来到了马房。农场喂了二五九匹马，这时候都不在家，有的在作工，有的到牧场吃青草去了。马房里只有两匹种马，一匹白马，是俄罗斯种，高大，漂亮，而且很机灵，它是骑用的马种，今年十一岁。另外一匹是生产用的马种，臀肥，腿粗，看样子，力气是很不小的，他的后代，上山拉套子，上城拉车子，决不成问题。
    我们又走到牛栏，这是一个新式大牛栏，里面有电灯，自来水，玻璃窗，有送牛粪的自动的推车，还有一种饮牛的自动水槽，安装在每只牛的面前。这是一个铁制的小槽，当中安一块铁片，用弹簧顶着，牛要是渴了，低下头来，用嘴巴抵着铁片，往下一按，水就被压出，从铁片盖不严的缝隙间，冒上了水槽，这样，牛用自己的嘴巴，解除了自己的口渴。
    农场喂了五百条牛，要是每条牛都要人陪它去饮水，那要花多少人力？现在，牛自己动嘴，完全用不着人管。
    挤牛奶也用机械代替了人手。一个小铜管，套在牛的奶头上，利用管子的吸力，往下吸奶，使之经过橡皮管，流进牛奶桶。据说，这种吸得非常匀称的管子，对于奶牛，比用手挤舒服些。在社会主义社会里，奶牛也都跟着享福了。
    五百条牛中，有两百条奶牛，去年一年，每条奶牛产奶四四七○公斤，要是草料喂得好，每一条牛，能产五千公斤奶。
    牛放牧去了。牛舍扫得干干净净的，每间小房的地板上，一点粪草也没有。两边两排玻璃窗，打开时，空气能对流，光线又充足，天晴的日子，阳光可以照到屋子里。牛的卫生是很讲究的。农场里有两个农业大学毕业的动物技师专门经管这些牛和别的牲畜的饮食、卫生和其他种种生活上的事情。
    牛舍里，每一间小房拴一条牛，小房横木上都钉着牌子，上面写着牛的名字，记着她的体重，她是哪一年生的？什么时候养娃娃？牌子上都记得清清楚楚。
    我们参观了也很干净的猪圈。猪正在睡觉。这里喂了三四四只猪，其中有五十只母猪。农场每年交给国家十五吨猪肉，公共食堂用十吨，其余的卖给城里。
    猪喂得很肥，一只有二百多公斤。种猪有二百五十公斤，睡在圈里，像一条小白牛一样。
    我们又看了鸡房。这里喂了一千只鸡。母鸡有五百，一只鸡一年能下一百二十五个蛋。
    农场有九辆大卡车，一辆拖拉机，农忙时节再到拖拉机站去租用。
    农场有二二○七公顷土地，每年用一半种植，另一半休耕。
    农场有二○六○个人，有八六○个劳动力，就是正式的集体农场的农民。
    外面有三根主要的电线通到农场来。这里要用大量的电。斯大林实现了列宁电气化的计划，农村大半都已电气化。这个农场的许多劳作都机械化，电气化了。种地打场都使用电力，其它如挤牛奶，孵小鸡也都用电气。家家户户，都有电灯和无线电收音机。发明还不很久的无线电传真的设备，这里也有了。农民散了工以后，坐在传真器之前，可以看到和听到莫斯科当晚上演的舞剧或歌剧。
    在电气化和机械化方面，苏联的农村已经和城市没有多大的区别。教育和文化方面，设施也完善。这个集体农场的一所小学和一所中学，除了培养自己农场的子弟以外，同时招收别的农场和附近工厂的工农的子弟。小学有学生一四六名。中学有学生三四八名。农民们的年青的一代，除了在自己农场工作的以外，还有两百多人在大学研究所里作研究工作和其他工作。
    这里有一座国家经营的医院，还有一所图书馆。为了使得人们在休息的时候尽情的娱乐，农场里除了无线电传真的设备以外，还有一座电影院，还有钢琴，有业余的管弦乐队和歌唱队，领导他们的人是从莫斯科来的音乐家。农民们除了欣赏自己农场的艺术以外，农闲时节常到城里去看戏。去年一个冬天里，他们到莫斯科去看了八十次戏。
    苏联的劳动人民都知道怎样欣赏艺术，提高自己和娱乐自己。他们更知道怎样的工作，怎样的尽自己对国家的责任。他们都深深体会着斯大林的话：“优美生活是不能凭空得到的。”他们都努力工作，尽量超过规定的任务。泰尔曼集体农场今年上半年在肉和牛奶和羊毛方面，已经完成了全年的计划。
    工作时间，农场里的男女老少都加倍的努力，三十二条奶牛，只要四个女人管。由于优异的劳动，这里有八个劳动英雄，还有三十几个人得了奖状和奖金。动物技师叶法建林娜也获得了劳动英雄的称号。她毕业于莫斯科的农业大学，一九四三年起，就在这农场工作。她细心的研究牲口的饲料。农场有四八○公顷草地，有三三四个牧场。在夏天，牲口都放牧在牧场里，让它们饱餐青草，长得膘肥腿壮，奶牛还能多出奶。人们又把夏天收割的青草藏进地窖里，每一地窖，藏一百吨，冬天用这种草来喂牛，也可以增加奶牛的产乳量。
    叶法建林娜提倡用各种不同的东西来喂牛，她用青草、干草、罐头草、紫萝卜、黄瓜、土豆和白菜来作牲口的饲料，有时还用葵花子。她根据每只牛的食量定出饲料的标准，一天一宿喂四次。
    由于叶法建林娜的研究和倡导，也由于全体饲养人员的努力，农场里出产丰富的牛奶，除交公以外，每一个超过了工作任务的人员，每年都有四吨牛奶的收入。而泰尔曼集体农场的总的收入已经由每年一百五十万卢布增加到三百二十万了。
    只有劳力和智力密切的结合，才会造成集体农场的繁荣。斯大林的五年计划，培养了各种各样的建设的人材。农场本身拥有农牧业上的各方面的专家。这里有两个动物技师，两个农学家，一个米邱林学者，还有三个铁匠和七个木匠，一个汽车修理匠，十二个车夫和七个拖拉机手。此外为了提高技术，加强理论与实际连系，集体农场和两个研究院有着密切的关系。研究院经常有院士和教授到这里来讲演，介绍新的经验，帮助农场培养新的科学的干部。
    集体农场的经济是一种巨大的经济，必须有计划。国家对集体农场有总的计划，根据国家的总生产计划，泰尔曼集体农场的十七个工作队各有自己的计划。农场里的工作是很紧张的，除与队之间进行着竞赛。冬天的准备工作，以及春耕、夏耘和秋收，都举行竞赛。每一个队有自己固定的土地、农具和牲口，他们的收成，决定他们的收入。农场根据每个队员的工作日，计算出该有多少收成，工作日所该收获的东西，按照一定的比例缴纳国家以外，其余都是队员自己的纯净的收入。
    远在一九三三年，苏联已经把贫农的生活提高到中农的水平了。当时斯大林说：“这当然很好，但是还不够。”还“要把一切集体农庄员都变成为生活丰裕的人”。
    斯大林的话，早已实现了。伟大的斯大林向来都是说到哪里，做到哪里的。一切集体农庄庄员都已变成生活丰裕的人了。我们已经知道，集体农场拥有一切现代化的满足丰裕的生活需要的设备。现在，农场主席日得可夫又引着我们去看农民的住宅。这个农场共有五二五幢独幢的房子。这是一些四围都有玻璃窗户的结实美丽的木房。房子的周围是菜园，或是花园。每家农家的住宅的附近有○·三亩土地是归农民私人使用的，农民在这块土地上栽种自己特别爱好的菜蔬，或培植各种各样的花果。
    我们参观的时候，青年和壮年的男女都到地里挖土豆去了，留在屋里看家的只有不能工作的老人和孩子。有几家人家邀我们进去。屋里都十分明亮，干净，而且很宽敞，家庭的每个成员都能有自己的卧室，此外还有餐室和厨房。卧室的床上铺着洁白的床单，放着松软的枕头，墙上挂着领袖像，有的还装饰着墙毯。家家户户的窗台上都摆着鲜艳的盆花。
    日得可夫同志告诉我们说：每个家庭都有属于自己的一条乳牛。一九三三年，在一篇有名的演说里，斯大林答应集体农场的女庄员们说：“我们布尔什维克总要设法使我们的集体农庄庄员每家有条乳牛的。”这个计划也早实现了。现在，集体农民每家都能用自己的乳牛身上才挤出来的新鲜的牛奶，来喂自己的孩子，并且供给全家的饮用。
    每个农民都知道，幸福不是容易得来的。苏联工人替农民准备了优良的新式的机器，联共党遵照了斯大林的天才的指示，加强了农场的各方面的领导，加强了共产党员和青年团员在集体农场里的责任心，这才使农民获得今天的美满的生活。农场的一切工作都贯穿着党的领导。党和青年团不断的通过墙报和小报和会议，指导各个工作队的耕种的工作。党也领导着农民遵照斯大林的指示，更好地使用机器和拖拉机，更好的改良土地的耕种。
    党的领导的强弱，是农场成就大小的关键。日得可夫同志本人，就是一位有经验的组织家。他生于一九○九年，没有念大学。他参加过光荣的保卫斯大林格勒的战役，住过初级党校，当过区委书记，区委委员和州的苏维埃代表。一九四七年，他当了这个农场的主席。他的衣着很朴素，人很端庄和严肃，他的眼睛和他的谈话表露他是一位精明能干的人物。他自然也得到了勋章，而且自然是一个勇敢的战士，但他没有说起在战争中他自己的功勋，他只告诉我们，在反对希特勒的战争年代里，这个农场有二百五十个青年农民上了前线，其中有一百二十人英勇殉国了。泰尔曼农场，和苏联的其他集体农场一样，是英雄的农场。他们为了自己和人类的幸福，付出了重大的代价。过去的许多机枪手、坦克手和飞机师，退伍之后，在这里驾驶卡车、驾驶拖拉机，勤恳地踏实地从事于和平的劳动，创造今天的美满的生活。
    但是，集体农民在田野里辛勤的劳动，不只是为了今天的美满的生活，也为了明天的美丽的理想，他们今天的效率高超的劳作，不只是为了苏联的富强，也是为了世界的和平。农场里所有的成人都已在和平宣言上签名，他们宣誓，要用自己的劳动，来增强国力，巩固和平。
    泰尔曼农场，在苏联不过是一个中等的集体农场，但已经给我们一种丰裕的繁荣的印象，我们满足的看完了各处，天气很好，日得可夫同志陪我们乘车到广阔无边的庄稼地里去巡游。车子在荞麦的白花和土豆的青苗之间慢慢的行驶，我们远远的看见一群群的头上挽了花花绿绿的头巾的强壮的妇女，弯着腰，在地里挖掘土豆子。我们想起了斯大林在一篇演说里的话：“妇女在集体农庄中是个巨大的力量。”
    我们每人摘了几苗荞麦花，插在上衣的上面口袋里，回到莫斯科。荞麦花一摘下来，就容易萎谢，但我们还是喜欢它，因为它并不是不结子的空花。
    我们带了集体农场的良好的印象，回到了自己的祖国。苏联的集体农场的今天，就是我们的广大农村的明天。苏联农业集体化的经验，可以使得我们明天的集体化运动不走弯路。但为了实现明天的希望，我们还要做许多工作。我们要在毛主席和党中央领导之下，万倍警惕的保卫祖国的疆土，解放台湾与西藏，完成全国的土改，还要勤勤恳恳的从事各方面建设，主要的是工业方面的建设和合作社的建设，来创造农业集体化的必要的条件，来为了几万万农民的灿烂的明天铺平着道路。
            一九五○年十月，北京。
