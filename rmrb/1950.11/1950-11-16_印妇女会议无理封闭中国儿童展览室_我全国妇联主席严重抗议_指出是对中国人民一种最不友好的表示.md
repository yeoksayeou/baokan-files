Xinhua News Agency, 15th: Cai Chang, Chairperson of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, sent a telegram to the All-India Women's Conference on the 12th of this month, lodging a strong protest against the unreasonable closure of the Chinese exhibition room participating in the Bombay Children's Exhibition Week by the responsible personnel of the conference. The full text of the protest telegram is as follows:

To the All-India Women's Conference:

According to the report from Comrade Kong Xiao, the person in charge of the Chinese exhibition room at the Bombay Children's Exhibition Week, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation has learned that our exhibition room has been forcibly closed by your conference's responsible personnel. The reason given for the closure is that the Chinese exhibition room displayed photographs of Japanese imperialism and American imperialism massacring Chinese children, which makes us feel extremely surprised and indignant.

The reason why the All-China Democratic Women's Federation participated in the Bombay Children's Exhibition Week was due to the invitation from your country's embassy in China. The exhibition materials of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation regarding the life of Chinese children were collected according to the program schedule drafted by your conference and delivered by your country's embassy in China. People all over the world know that the Chinese people have been engaged in the entire eight-year War of Resistance against Japan since 1937, and have been engaged in more than four years of liberation war to resist the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group armed by American imperialism since 1946. Now, our Taiwan is again suffering from the invasion of the armed forces of American imperialism, and our Northeast is suffering from the strafing and bombing of American imperialist aircraft. Please calculate, and you will know that Chinese children under the age of fifteen are growing up in the midst of gunfire. Being killed by the guns and ammunition of Japanese imperialism and American imperialism is a part of the painful life of our Chinese children. If the Indian people, especially Indian mothers, who are fighting for the freedom and independence of their motherland, hope to truly understand the Chinese people, especially the Chinese children, they must understand our older and younger generations from our disaster-ridden, unyielding and painful life, and they must understand our older and younger generations from our continuous struggle against Japanese and American imperialism.

We are very surprised and indignant that when the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, with full enthusiasm, disregarding the remoteness of the journey, exhibited the painful life, the struggle life, and the happy life after liberation of the Chinese people and children in front of the Indian people, your conference's responsible personnel forcibly closed our exhibition room. These staff members of your conference are afraid of the truth, and they dare not let the Indian people and mothers know the world-known crimes of American imperialism, even Japanese imperialism, in destroying peace, creating war, and massacring the Chinese people and children. Their behavior is the most unfriendly expression to the Chinese people and mothers. Their behavior can never reflect the will of the vast number of Indian women who are willing to understand each other and establish close friendship with Chinese women, and will inevitably be opposed by the vast number of Indian women. Due to this unreasonable behavior of your conference's responsible personnel, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, representing all Chinese women and children, lodges a serious protest with your country.

All-China Democratic Women's Federation
Chairperson Cai Chang
November 12, 1950, in Beijing

　　印妇女会议无理封闭中国儿童展览室
    我全国妇联主席严重抗议
    指出是对中国人民一种最不友好的表示
    【新华社十五日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅曾于本月十二日致电全印妇女会议，对该会负责人员无理封闭参加孟买儿童展览周的中国展览室一事，提出严重抗议。该抗议电全文如下：全印妇女会议：
    根据孟买儿童展览周中国展览室主持人孔筱同志的报告，中华全国民主妇女联合会获悉我国展览室已为贵会负责人强迫封闭。封闭的理由是因为在中国展览室中陈列出日本帝国主义和美国帝国主义屠杀中国儿童的照片，这使我们感到非常惊异和愤慨。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会之所以参加孟买儿童展览周，是由于贵国驻中国大使馆代为邀请的。中华全国民主妇女联合会关于中国儿童生活的展览资料，是根据贵会拟定并由贵国驻中国大使馆交来的节目表予以搜集的。全世界人民都知道中国人民从一九三七年以来，进行了整整八年的抗日战争，从一九四六年以来，为了反抗由美国帝国主义武装起来的蒋介石反动集团，进行了四年多的解放战争。现在，我们的台湾又遭受了美国帝国主义武装部队的侵略、我们的东北又遭受了美国帝国主义飞机的扫射与轰炸。请你们计算一下，就可知道，我们中国十五岁以下的儿童是在炮火中生长出来的。遭受日本帝国主义和美国帝国主义枪炮、弹药的杀害是我们中国儿童痛苦生活的一部分。如果正在为自己祖国的自由与独立而斗争的印度人民，特别是印度的母亲，希望真正了解中国的人民，特别是中国的儿童，就不能不从我们多灾多难不屈不挠的痛苦生活中来了解我们的老一代和新一代，就不能不从我们再接再厉反抗日本和美国帝国主义的奋斗生活中来了解我们的老一代和新一代。
    我们非常惊异和愤慨，当中华全国民主妇女联合会怀抱着满腔热情，不顾路途的遥远，将中国人民与儿童的痛苦生活、奋斗生活与解放后的快乐生活，用照片展览在印度人民的面前时，贵会负责人竟强迫封闭了我们的展览室。贵会的这些工作人员害怕真理，竟不敢将美国帝国主义甚至日本帝国主义破坏和平、制造战争、屠杀中国人民与儿童的世所周知的罪行，让印度的人民和母亲知道。她们这种行为，对于中国人民和母亲是一种最不友好的表示。她们的行为决不能反映印度广大妇女愿与中国妇女互相了解并建立亲密友谊的意志，并必将遭受印度广大妇女的反对。由于贵会负责人的这种无理的行为，中华全国民主妇女联合会代表全中国妇女和儿童，向贵国提出严重的抗议。

    一九五○年十一月十二日于北京
