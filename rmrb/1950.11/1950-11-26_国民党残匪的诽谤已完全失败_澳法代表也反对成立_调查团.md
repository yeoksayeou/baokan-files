(Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 23rd) TASS dispatches from New York on the 23rd: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly continued to discuss the Kuomintang's slander case against the Soviet Union on the morning of the 22nd.

The Australian representative, Officer, spoke first, opposing the Kuomintang's proposal to establish a so-called "investigation team" to collect "information and facts" about the Kuomintang's "accusations." Officer said that establishing such an investigation team would produce "only negative results." Officer urged UN member states to cease discussion of this issue. He also opposed Syria's proposal to submit the issue to the International Court of Justice.

The Czechoslovakian representative, Picek, requested the Political Committee to cease discussion of the Kuomintang's slander case. He pointed out that this slander case was illegally placed on the UN agenda by the Kuomintang group, which is unauthorized to represent the Chinese people.

The French representative said that he did not support the Kuomintang representative's proposal to establish an "investigation team."

The next speaker was the Syrian representative, who proposed a motion to submit the entire issue to an ad hoc committee so that the committee could collect "materials and facts" related to the Kuomintang's "accusation" case and submit them to the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly.

The Australian representative opposed the Syrian representative's proposal. He recalled that the Kuomintang's "accusation" case was submitted to an ad hoc committee at the previous session of the General Assembly, and the ad hoc committee was unable to submit any report to the current session of the General Assembly. The Australian representative proposed that the Political Committee should "take note" of all the statements made by the delegations on this issue and should not take any other decisions.

The Kuomintang group's representative, Jiang Tingfu, reiterated his slanderous accusations against the Soviet Union. He recognized that his slander had completely failed and requested the Political Committee to give the Kuomintang regime "moral support."

The next speaker was the British representative, Younger, who supported the Australian representative's opinion of stopping the discussion of this issue. He said that further research would be "metaphysical" and "pedantic."

The Soviet representative, Malik, cited many facts for the Political Committee's attention, which powerfully refuted the Kuomintang elements' false claim that the equipment supplied by the United States was only enough to supply 39 Kuomintang divisions. According to the materials from the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, from the Japanese surrender to January 1950, the United States partially or fully trained or equipped 36 Kuomintang armies, equivalent to 166 divisions. Malik read out excerpts from the US "White Paper," the materials of which exposed the Kuomintang elements' lies.

Malik asked the Political Committee to pay attention to the fact that the Chinese People's Liberation Army was well-equipped because of the American equipment seized from the Kuomintang. Even the so-called National Assembly of Kuomintang China had to admit in its resolution on April 22, 1948: The American-equipped troops with first-class equipment are the real source of supply for the Communist army. ... The US equipment was really only used half... the other half fell into the hands of the Communists. ... The Communists thus have an endless source of supply.

Malik said: No slanderous remarks by the Kuomintang agents can refute the facts and documents that everyone knows about the true source of the People's Liberation Army's equipment.

Regarding the Kuomintang elements' various slanderous remarks attempting to diminish the importance of the Soviet Union's peaceful and friendly policy towards China and the Chinese people, Malik recited several official documents and recalled many well-known facts, stating that it was the Soviet government and the Soviet people who were the first in Chinese history to abolish unequal treaties, abandon all privileges in China, and declare that they would negotiate with China and the Chinese people on the basis of mutual equality, rather than treating them as masters treat slaves. Malik also recalled that Japan, the United States, and other countries continued to use the privileges granted to them in China by unequal treaties until before the Second World War.

Malik said: The Soviet people have never forced anyone to accept any unequal treaties, and do not intend to do so now.

The Kuomintang representative called on the United Nations to provide "moral support." Malik pointed out that the United Nations has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of any country, including China. The United Nations must especially not support those who are politically bankrupt and have become murderous bandits, which is what the current Kuomintang group is.

Malik said: At present, the best support for the Chinese people is to allow the legitimate representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to participate in the United Nations, and not to give any support to the Kuomintang group, which has been thrown into the dustbin of history by the Chinese people.

Malik firmly opposed submitting the Kuomintang's slander to the so-called "ad hoc committee" for review, as the committee had already discussed the slander case, and after not making any decision, returned it to the General Assembly. In conclusion, Malik expressed his support for the statements of certain countries in the Political Committee who expressed the hope to end the discussion of the Kuomintang's slander case, thereby no longer wasting time on it, as this slander was unworthy of refutation from the beginning, and still is.

The representatives of Egypt and Peru supported the proposal put forward by the Syrian representative, which stipulated that the Kuomintang's slander case should be submitted to the ad hoc committee for review again.

As the meeting was nearing its end, US Representative Dulles rose to speak. He said that the Syrian suggestion was noteworthy and should be supported by the Political Committee. Most of Dulles' speech was used to oppose the speeches of the representatives of various countries in the Political Committee who urged the end of the discussion of the Kuomintang's slander case. After Dulles spoke, the Political Committee adjourned.

### 国民党残匪的诽谤已完全失败  澳法代表也反对成立“调查团”

　　国民党残匪的诽谤已完全失败
    澳法代表也反对成立“调查团”
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约二十三日电：联合国大会政治委员会于二十二日上午继续讨论国民党诽谤苏联案。
    澳大利亚代表奥菲瑟首先发言，反对国民党所提出的建立所谓“调查团”以搜集有关国民党“控诉”的“情报与事实”的建议。奥菲瑟说：建立这样一个调查团所能产生的，“只是消极的结果”。奥菲瑟力促联合国会员国停止讨论这个问题。他并且反对叙利亚所提出的将此问题提交国际法院的建议。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表皮塞克要求政治委员会停止讨论国民党的诽谤案。他指出：这个诽谤案是被无权代表中国人民的国民党集团非法地列入联合国议程中的。
    法国代表说：他不支持国民党代表所提出的成立“调查团”的提案。
    下一个发言者为叙利亚代表，他提一项提案，建议将整个问题提交临时委员会，以便该委员会收集与国民党“控诉”案有关的“资料与事实”送呈联合国大会第六届会议。
    澳大利亚代表反对叙利亚代表的提议，他追述国民党的“控诉”案是在大会上次会议上提交临时委员会的，而临时委员会不能向大会本届会议提出任何报告。澳代表提议：政治委员会应“注意”各代表团对这个问题所发表的一切言论，而不应采取任何其他的决定。
    国民党集团的代表蒋廷黻再次申述他对苏联的诽谤控告，他认识到他的诽谤已完全失败，遂请求政治委员会给予国民党政权以“道义支持”。
    接着发言的是英国代表杨格，他支持澳大利亚代表所提出的停止这个问题的讨论的意见，他说：进一步的研究就带有“玄虚的性质”和“学究气”了。
    苏联代表马立克举出了许多事实请政治委员会注意，这些事实有力地驳倒了国民党分子所说的美国供给的装备只够供给国民党三十九个师之用的虚伪说法。根据中国人民解放军总部的材料，从日本投降到一九五○年一月这段期间，美国部分地或全部地训练或装备了国民党三十六个军，相当于一百六十六个师。马立克宣读了从美国“白皮书”节录来的文字，其中的材料暴露了国民党分子的谎话。
    马立克请政委会注意这个事实：中国人民解放军装备良好，是由于从国民党手里缴获的美国装备所致。就是国民党中国的所谓国民大会在一九四八年四月二十二日的决议里，也不得不承认：拥有第一等装备的美械部队，是共产党军队的供应的真正来源。……美国装备实在只用了一半……其余一半却落到了共产党手里。……共产党就这样有着无穷尽的供应来源。
    马立克说：国民党代理人的任何诽谤谰言，都不能驳倒大家都知道的关于人民解放军装备的真正来源的事实与文件。
    关于国民党分子企图抑低苏联对中国与中国人民的和平与友好政策之重要性的种种诽谤谰言，马立克诵读了若干正式文件，并且追述了人所共知的许多事实，说明在中国历史上第一个取消不平等条约，放弃在中国的一切特权并宣布他们将和中国与中国人民以互相平等的关系，而不是以主人对待奴隶的关系进行谈判的，正是苏联政府和苏联人民。马立克还回忆说：日本、美国和其他国家，却直到第二次世界大战前都在继续利用不平等条约所给予他们在中国的特权。
    马立克说：苏联人民从来没有强迫过任何人接受任何的不平等条约，现在也不打算这样作。
    国民党代表呼吁联合国给予“道义的支持”。马立克为此指出：联合国没有权利干涉任何国家的内政，包括中国在内。联合国尤其决不可支持那些在政治上破产的人们，他们已变成了杀人犯匪帮，现在的国民党集团就是这样。
    马立克说：在目前，对中国人民的最好支持，便是让中华人民共和国中央人民政府的合法代表参加联合国，而不给予国民党集团以任何支持，这个集团已被中国人民投到历史的垃圾堆里了。
    马立克断然反对把国民党的诽谤提交所谓“临时委员会”审议，该委员会已经讨论过这个诽谤案，而且没有作出任何决定又把它交回了大会。马立克在结语中表示拥护政治委员会上某些国家的声明，它们曾表示希望结束关于国民党诽谤案的讨论，从而不再在这上面浪费时间，这种诽谤从开头就是不值一驳的，现在还是这样。
    埃及和秘鲁的代表们支持叙利亚代表所提出的提案，该提案规定把国民党的诽谤案再度提交临时委员会审议。
    会议快结束时美代表杜勒斯起立发言。他说：叙利亚的建议值得注意，而且应该受到政委会的支持。杜勒斯的发言大部分是用来反对政委会中力促结束讨论国民党诽谤案的各国代表的发言。杜勒斯发言后政委会即休会。
