　　Record of Talks with Several Soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    "Valiantly and spiritedly, we cross the Yalu River! To protect peace, to defend the motherland, is to protect our homes! Good sons and daughters of China, united as one, resist America and aid Korea, defeat the American imperialist wolves!"
    [Xinhua News Agency, Somewhere in northern Korea, 25th] Our correspondent reports: "Valiantly and spiritedly, we cross the Yalu River! To protect peace, to defend the motherland, is to protect our homes! Good sons and daughters of China, united as one, resist America and aid Korea, defeat the American imperialist wolves!"—This is a widely circulated poem that the reporter heard among the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the front lines.
    The reporter visited Yin Yanbao, a squad leader of the Volunteer Army. He was an old worker who had worked in the Mudanjiang coal mine for seven or eight years. He said to the reporter, "I have suffered at the hands of the Japanese devils, and I've had enough! Now the American devils want to invade us again, to invade the whole world. We must not let their evil scheme succeed!" Yin Yanbao understood many principles after liberation, so he saw through the conspiracy of American imperialism at a glance. He said, "The American devils definitely don't just want to destroy Korea. They want to attack our Northeast from Korea, follow the old path of the Japanese devils, and destroy our whole China. We can't just sit idly by and watch the enemy invade." This worker, who lived in the Mudanjiang area and often came into contact with the Korean people, could more deeply appreciate the close relationship of shared adversity between the Chinese and Korean people. He said, "When we were fighting Japan, the Koreans joined our ranks and helped us fight Japan. Some teams in the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army were entirely organized by Koreans. There were also Korean volunteer units in the interior. Now, America is invading both China and Korea, and the Korean people are taking the brunt. In good conscience, we should help." That's how Yin Yanbao joined the Volunteer Army.
    Another Volunteer Army soldier also told me how he came to the Korean front. He said, "I haven't fought in a war before, but when America sent troops to approach our country from tens of thousands of miles away, I couldn't stay at home any longer. We Chinese people didn't send troops to San Francisco, but the American devils occupied our Taiwan and attacked Korea, setting fire to our doorstep. The American devils should know that Korea is our close neighbor, and we will never allow the invaders to destroy this neighboring country."
    The reporter met a farmer in the rear of the front line who was transporting artillery shells for the Volunteer Army. His home was in Liaodong Province, across the Yalu River. He said excitedly, "My son joined the army to fight the Japanese devils and also fought the American devils' running dogs, the Kuomintang reactionaries. He sacrificed himself two years ago while fighting the Kuomintang bandits. Now the American devils are coming out themselves to invade us, trying to seize the fruits of victory that my son exchanged with his life. I really can't stay at home and farm my land." He also recounted how his neighbors, like him, crossed the Yalu River to support the Korean People's Army.
    The reporter also visited a 19-year-old female student from Hunan named Zhou and her fellow villager of the same age. Inspired by the names of heroes like Liu Hulan, Zhao Yiman, and Guo Junqing, they resolutely joined the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. They felt infinitely honored to have become soldiers fighting alongside the Korean People's Army. This female soldier, who had just left school, told the reporter firmly, "Korea's independence is in danger. The motherland is also facing the threat of American imperialism. We haven't contributed anything to the people in the past, and we can't hesitate any longer! We have made all the necessary preparations: running, going hungry, camping... even sacrificing our lives. We have considered everything, and we are not afraid of anything. We will bravely face everything, as long as it is for the motherland, for the compatriots of the motherland, for the beloved Korean people, and for peace in the Far East and the world!"
    As the reporter was listening to these two female soldiers talk eloquently, their commander told the story of another female student he had encountered who resolutely joined the Volunteer Army. He said, "Considering that the female student's physical condition was relatively weak, we considered it again and again and didn't allow her to go to the front line. But she cut her hair short and came back to request, saying, 'Can't I be like a male comrade?'"
    The Chinese People's Anti-American Aid Korea Volunteer Army is composed of many such people with a high degree of political awareness. They are fighting bravely on the Korean soil south of the Yalu River with hatred for American imperialism, loyalty and love for the motherland, and selfless friendship for the Korean people.

　　记中国人民志愿部队几位战士的谈话
    “雄赳赳，气昂昂，跨过鸭绿江！保和平，卫祖国，就是保家乡！ 中国好儿女，齐心团结紧，抗美援朝鲜，打败美帝野心狼！”
    【新华社朝鲜北部某地二十五日电】本社记者报道称：“雄赳赳，气昂昂，跨过鸭绿江！保和平，卫祖国，就是保家乡！中国好儿女，齐心团结紧，抗美援朝鲜，打败美帝野心狼！”——这是记者在前线上的中国人民志愿部队中听到的广泛流传着的一首诗。
    记者曾访问志愿部队的一个班长殷延宝。他是在牡丹江煤矿里做过七八年工的老工人。他对记者说：“我吃过日本鬼子的苦头，我是受够了！现在美国鬼子又想侵略我们，侵略全世界，决不能让他们这个鬼计实现！”殷延宝在解放后懂得了许多道理，所以他对美帝国主义的阴谋一眼就看破了，他说：“美国鬼子决不是单单要灭亡朝鲜，它是想从朝鲜进攻咱们东北，走日本鬼子的老路，要灭亡咱们全中国。咱们可不能眼巴巴地看着敌人打进来。”这生活在牡丹江一带而经常与朝鲜人民接触的工人，更能深深体会中朝两国人民患难与共的亲密关系，他说：“打日本的时候，朝鲜人参加咱们的队伍，帮助咱们打日本，东北抗日联军里面有些队伍全是朝鲜人组织起来的，关内也有朝鲜义勇队。现在，美国侵略中国，也侵略朝鲜，朝鲜人民挡了头阵，论良心，咱们也应该帮助。”殷延宝就是这样参加志愿部队的。
    另一位志愿部队战士也告诉了我他是怎么来到朝鲜前线的。他说：“我过去没有打过仗，但是当离我国上万里以外的美国竟派兵逼近我国时，我再也不能呆在家里了。我们中国人并没有派兵到旧金山去，而美国鬼子却把我们的台湾占了去的，还进攻朝鲜，把火烧到我们门口。美国鬼子可要知道，朝鲜是我国的紧邻，我们是绝不答应让侵略者灭亡这邻邦的。”
    记者在前线后方遇到了一位为志愿部队运送炮弹的农民，他家在鸭绿江那边的辽东省。他激动地说：“我的儿子曾参加部队打日本鬼子，也打过美国鬼子的走狗国民党反动派，他已在两年前和国民党匪帮作战时牺牲了。现在美国鬼子自己出头露面来侵略我们，想夺取我的儿子用生命换来的胜利果实，我实在不能留在家里种我的庄稼了。”他还叙述了他的邻居们也和他一样地跨过鸭绿江来支援朝鲜人民军。
    记者也访问了一个姓周的十九岁的湖南女学生和她的一位同样年纪的同乡。她们被刘胡兰、赵一曼、郭俊卿等英雄的名字所感召，坚决地参加了中国人民志愿部队。她们因自己已成为与朝鲜人民军并肩作战的战士而感到无限光荣。这位刚脱离学校不久的女战士坚毅地告诉记者：“朝鲜的独立正在危险中。祖国也正面临着美帝国主义的威胁。我们过去对人民没有什么贡献，现在再也不能犹疑了！我们已经做了一切应有的准备：跑路、饿饭、露营，……甚至牺牲了我们的生命。一切我们都考虑过了，我们什么也不怕。我们会勇敢地迎接一切，只要是为着祖国，为了祖国的同胞，为着亲爱的朝鲜人民，为着远东和世界的和平！”
    当记者正听着这两个女战士侃侃而谈的时候，她们的指挥员又讲了他所碰到的一位女学生坚决参加志愿部队的故事。他说：“顾虑到那位女学生的体质较弱，我们曾再三考虑，没有容许她到前线去。但她就把头发剪光了再来要求，说：‘我像男同志一样不行吗？’”
    中国人民抗美援朝志愿部队就是由许许多多这样有高度政治觉悟的人们组成的，他们满怀着对美帝国主义的仇恨，对祖国的忠诚热爱，对朝鲜人民的无私的友谊，在鸭绿江南岸的朝鲜土地上英勇战斗着。
