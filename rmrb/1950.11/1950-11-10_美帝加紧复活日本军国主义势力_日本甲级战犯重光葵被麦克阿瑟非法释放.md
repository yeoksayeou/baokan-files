　　U.S. Imperialism Intensifies the Revival of Japanese Militaristic Forces
    Japanese Class A War Criminal Mamoru Shigemitsu
    Illegally Released by MacArthur
    [Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch] MacArthur, the head of the U.S. occupation forces in Japan, following the illegal large-scale release of Japanese war criminals and the lifting of purges against reactionaries, is now unscrupulously illegally releasing Class A war criminal Mamoru Shigemitsu. According to an Associated Press Tokyo dispatch: MacArthur's headquarters legal section announced on the 8th that Japan's wartime Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu will be "paroled" from Sugamo Prison on November 21. The statement also claimed: Shigemitsu had "behaved well" in prison.

    In order to accelerate the revival of Japanese militaristic forces, MacArthur arbitrarily issued Directive No. 5 on March 7 this year, unilaterally stipulating that all war criminals serving prison sentences in Japan could be granted "parole" before the expiration of their sentences. To date, one hundred and eighteen Japanese war criminals have been "paroled" and released, and another nine will also be released on the 15th. Shigemitsu is the first Class A war criminal to be paroled. Shigemitsu was engaged in activities to invade China for a long time, and the 1932 "Shanghai Armistice Agreement" was planned by him. During the war, he served as the Japanese ambassador to the Wang Jingwei puppet government and the foreign minister of the Tojo and Koiso cabinets, actively promoting aggressive diplomacy. After Japan's surrender, Shigemitsu was listed as a Class A war criminal and sentenced to seven years in prison by the Far East International Military Tribunal. MacArthur's perverse measure of illegally "paroling" Shigemitsu undermined the judgment of the Far East International Military Tribunal, in which the United States also participated.

### 美帝加紧复活日本军国主义势力  日本甲级战犯重光葵被麦克阿瑟非法释放

　　美帝加紧复活日本军国主义势力
    日本甲级战犯重光葵
    被麦克阿瑟非法释放
    【新华社九日讯】美国驻日本占领军首脑麦克阿瑟，继非法大批释放日本战犯及解除反动分子整肃处分之后，现又肆无忌惮地非法释放甲级战犯重光葵。据美联社东京讯：麦克阿瑟总部法律组八日宣布，日本战时的外相重光葵将于十一月二十一日自巢鸭监狱“假释”出狱。声明并称：重光葵在狱中“行为良好”。
    麦克阿瑟为了加紧复活日本军国主义势力，擅自在今年三月七日颁发第五号指令，片面规定在日本执行徒刑的一切战犯，都可在刑期届满之前获得“假释”。迄今为止，“假释”出狱的日本战犯已有一百十八名，另有九名亦将于十五日出狱。而重光葵则为第一个被假释的甲级战犯。重光葵曾长期从事侵略中国活动，一九三二年的《淞沪停战协定》就是他一手布置的。战时他曾任日本驻汪精卫傀儡政府大使及东条与小矶内阁的外相，积极推行侵略外交。日本投降后，重光葵被列为甲级战犯，并由远东国际军事法庭判处七年徒刑。麦克阿瑟非法“假释”重光葵的悖谬措施，破坏了美国也曾参加的远东国际军事法庭的判决。
