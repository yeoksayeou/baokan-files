　　Korean People Residing in Yanbian, Jilin
    Request to Return Home to Fight and Defend the Fatherland
    [By Our Staff Reporter] Korean people residing in the Yanbian area of Jilin Province are eagerly requesting to return to their country to fight. The Korean people of Yanbian have contributed everything they had to the cause of the Chinese people's liberation over the past four years, demonstrating great heroism. Beginning in 1946, tens of thousands of young people bravely joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army. For four years, they crossed mountains and rivers, fighting from the northernmost part of mainland China all the way to Hainan Island in the far south. During the arduous days of the long journey, they endured all kinds of suffering, and not a single person fell behind or complained. In every fierce battle, they demonstrated the brave and tenacious characteristics of the Korean people. At that time, when Korean women heard that their husbands had died on the front lines, they wiped away their tears and sent their sons again; when their sons died, they sent their younger brothers. Li Yujin from Yanji County sent her younger brother to the People's Liberation Army after her husband died in the battle of Sipingjie. Jin Zixiang, a farmer in Hailan Village in his fifties, sent his three beloved sons and two younger brothers to the front when the war situation was most critical. People in the rear fully understood that the war at the front could not be won without the support of the rear. Workers and farmers put down their work, carried stretchers, and drove carts, marching alongside the PLA soldiers to the front lines to undertake arduous military transport tasks. Over four years, more than 40,000 Korean people shuttled through the battlefields amidst fierce artillery fire, transporting the wounded and delivering ammunition; they ate coarse grains themselves and transported the good grains to the front lines, consistently from 1946 until the complete liberation of Northeast China in 1948. Some farmers even carried stretchers and followed the PLA to fight beyond the border. In this way, the Korean people wrote a glorious page in the history of the Chinese People's Liberation War with their blood and sweat.
    Now, the Korean people residing in Yanbian are closely following the development of the Korean War with extreme anger. In particular, the vast numbers of workers and farmers are eagerly requesting to return home to participate in the war to defend their fatherland. Newspapers have been subscribed to in every village, and people produce during the day and gather together to discuss the situation in the evenings. Farmers in Hailan Village, Yanji, purchased a radio themselves, listened to it at night, and then went to each household during the day to spread the news. Farmers in various villages have also held discussion meetings, preparing to dedicate all their strength to the liberation of the fatherland at any time.

　　留居吉林延边的朝鲜人民
    要求回国参战保卫祖国
    【本报讯】留居吉林延边地区的朝鲜人民，纷纷要求返国作战。延边地区朝鲜人民，在过去四年的中国人民解放事业中贡献了自己的一切，表现了伟大的英雄气概。他们从一九四六年开始，有数万青年勇敢地参加了中国人民解放军。四年来，爬山涉水，从中国大陆的最北部，一直打到最南方的海南岛，在数万里辽阔征途艰难的日子里，忍受着一切痛苦，没有一个人掉队和发怨言。在每次激烈的战斗中，均表现了勇敢顽强的朝鲜民族的特色。当时朝鲜的妇女们，听到丈夫在前线牺牲的时候，她们擦干眼泪把儿子再送去，儿子牺牲了，把弟弟再送去。延吉县李玉今，当她的丈夫在四平街战斗中牺牲时，她把弟弟也送到解放军中去。海兰村一个五十多岁的农民金子乡，当战争情况最紧急的时候把心爱的三个儿子两个弟弟都送到前方去。后方的人们完全知道，前方的战争没有后方的支援是不能获得胜利的。工人、农民们，放下自己的工作，抬着担架，赶着大车，与解放军战士并肩走上前方，担任了繁重的军运任务。在四年中，四万余朝鲜人民，穿梭在猛烈炮火的战场上，转运伤兵，运送弹药；一年辛勤生产的粮食，自己吃粗的，把好的运给前方，自一九四六年起，一直坚持到一九四八年东北的全获解放。有的农民又抬着担架跟着解放军打到关里去。朝鲜人民在中国人民解放战争历史上，就这样用自己的血和汗写出了光辉的一页。
    现在留居延边的朝鲜人民正以极愤怒的心情，密切关怀着朝鲜战争的发展。特别是广大的工人、农民们，纷纷要求回国参加保卫祖国的战争。现在各村都订了报纸，白天生产，晚上就聚在一块互相谈论。延吉海兰村农民自己购买了收音机，晚上听了白天再往各家去宣传。各村农民并纷纷召开座谈会，准备再把一切力量，随时献给祖国的解放事业。
