Xinhua News Agency, November 21st dispatch: A comprehensive dispatch from TASS, New York: The United Nations General Assembly held consecutive plenary sessions on November 16th and 17th.

When the plenary session on the 17th began to consider the Soviet Union's "Declaration on the Cessation of the Threat of a New War and the Consolidation of World Peace and Security" proposal, the US-UK bloc, which had brazenly rejected this proposal in the Political Committee, fearing that open discussion in the plenary session would expand the great influence of these peace-loving proposals of the Soviet Union among the people of the world, disregarded the opposition of the Soviet Union and other countries and decided to put it to a vote without discussion.

The preamble of the Soviet proposal, as well as the substantive provisions stipulating condemnation and prohibition of propaganda for a new war, prohibition of the use of atomic weapons and establishment of strict international control to supervise the implementation of the ban, the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers, and the reduction of armaments by one-third by the major powers, were all rejected by the US through the manipulation of the majority voting machine. In each vote, the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted in favor, with five to eleven abstentions.

The joint proposal put forward by the United States, Britain, and other countries in the Political Committee to conceal their criminal face of opposing the Soviet proposal was purely deceptive, and was passed by the US-UK majority despite the opposition of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. The US-UK majority also rejected a number of amendments proposed by the Soviet Union in order to turn this joint proposal into a genuine tool for strengthening peace and security, including the addition of effective provisions such as banning the use of atomic weapons and banning propaganda for a new war.

The Chilean proposal, which vaguely condemned "propaganda against the cause of peace" during the Political Committee's discussion of the Soviet proposal, was also passed by a majority of the General Assembly; the Soviet Union and other countries abstained.

After the vote, Soviet delegation head Vyshinsky issued a statement explaining the reasons for the vote, saying: Although the joint proposal of the United States, Britain, and other countries passed by the General Assembly has a sonorous name, it does not, in reality, contain even a shadow of any practical action that would benefit peace. This proposal evades the most important and fundamental issue of banning atomic weapons, and the entire proposal merely mentions the establishment of international control. We have been and are still insisting on the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and other instruments of mass destruction, as well as the establishment of strict international control, but we believe that this cannot be limited to mentioning international control while evading the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons, because in any case it is impossible to control something that is not prohibited; one cannot control the implementation of a ban before atomic weapons are banned! Vyshinsky pointed out: The reason for making this decision lies in the foreign policy of the United States, which does not want to alleviate the burden of taxes heavily on the shoulders of taxpayers, but wants to intensify the arms race, stockpile atomic bombs, and so on.

Vyshinsky continued: From the point of view of opposing propaganda for a new war, this proposal, which has been passed, is also unsatisfactory. He reiterated that America’s war hysteria is becoming increasingly intense, and that propaganda for a new war is being stepped up. He said: We must take urgent measures to end the heinous war propaganda. The Soviet government believes that it has a responsibility to continue to fight against the instigators of a new war, and to fight for peace in general. The Soviet socialist state, from the first day of its establishment, has stubbornly and consistently engaged in this struggle. The leader of the Soviet government said in 1925: We do not want to be a hammer bullying the weak, nor do we want to be an anvil oppressed by the strong. We want neither, we want peace. Vyshinsky then said: That is why the Soviet delegation proposed several amendments to the joint proposal of the United States, Britain, and other countries to stop the arms race, stop war hysteria, and ban war propaganda. The US-UK majority did not want to listen to our advice. Vyshinsky concluded: The Soviet Union will continue to fight for peace.

Ukrainian delegation head Baranovksy, in explaining the reasons for the vote, said: The Ukrainian delegation has consistently and resolutely demanded the passage of the Soviet proposal, because it believes that measures to consolidate peace and security based on a policy of peaceful and friendly resolution of international disputes can undoubtedly become a serious obstacle to preventing the spread of propaganda for a new war, and a stumbling block to the aggressive acts of the imperialists. However, the United States and other powerful countries do not want to take this path. Baranovksy said: Despite the fact that the majority of the General Assembly rejected the Soviet proposal and the amendments to the joint proposal of the United States, Britain, and other countries, the Ukrainian delegation will, together with the delegations of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, continue to fight even more resolutely and unswervingly for peace, for the consolidation of friendship and cooperation between the peoples of all countries, and against launching another war.

The US voting machine also hurriedly passed at the plenary session on the 17th the so-called "Obligations of States in the Event of the Outbreak of War" proposal submitted by Yugoslavia, which confused the definition of aggression and was beneficial to aggressors, and passed the Soviet proposal clearly defining aggression to the International Law Commission of the General Assembly for study. Even the Soviet amendment that the International Law Commission should submit the results of its study of the definition of aggression before the Sixth General Assembly of the United Nations was rejected by the US-UK majority. The representatives of Ukraine, Poland, and Czechoslovakia pointed out in explaining the reasons for the vote: The decision to submit the Soviet proposal to the International Law Commission for study shows that some countries do not want a definition of aggression, because this definition may prevent them from launching aggression.

The US-UK majority also simultaneously passed at the plenary session on the 17th the proposal submitted by Yugoslavia to establish the so-called "Permanent Mediation Committee" to usurp the functions of the Security Council to the illegal "Small General Assembly"; the Soviet Union and other countries voted against it.

The plenary session on the 16th discussed the issue of the former Italian colony of Libya. The proposal submitted by Egypt, Canada, and thirteen other countries, which stipulated that Libya should obtain independence, but did not provide the necessary guarantees to prevent the British and French administrative authorities from splitting Libya, was passed by a majority of the General Assembly on the 17th; the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries abstained. The Soviet proposal to ensure the unification and independence of Libya, which stipulated that the various parts of Libya should be unified into one country and that national legislative and administrative institutions should be established, that all foreign troops should withdraw from Libya within three months, and that military bases in Libya should be removed, was rejected by the US-UK majority.

　　联大在美国操纵下否决苏联和平提案苏代表团长维辛斯基发表声明
    指出美英等国联合提案丝毫无益于和平
    严正宣告苏联将继续为世界和平而斗争
    【新华社二十一日讯】综合塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会于十一月十六、十七日连续举行全体会议。
    十七日全体会议着手审议苏联所提出的“制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平安全宣言”案时，曾在政治委员会中悍然否决这个提案的美英集团，为了害怕在全体会议展开讨论会扩大苏联这些爱好和平的建议在世界人民中的伟大影响，竟不顾苏联等国的反对，而决定不进行讨论即迳付表决。
    苏联提案中的序言，以及实效部分规定谴责并禁止新战争宣传、禁止使用原子武器并建立严格国际管制以监督禁令的执行、五大国缔结和平公约、大国裁减军备三分之一的各节，均被美国操纵多数表决机器所否决。在每次表决时，苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰及捷克斯洛伐克都投票赞成，有五票至十一票弃权。
    美、英等国在政治委员会讨论苏联提案时，为了掩饰其反对苏联提案的罪恶面目而提出的纯属欺骗的联合提案，在苏联及人民民主国家的反对下，竟为美英多数所通过。美英多数并否决苏联为了把这联合提案变为真正加强和平与安全的工具所提出的多项修正案，其中包括添加禁止使用原子武器、禁止新战争宣传等项有效规定。
    在政治委员会讨论苏联提案时智利所提出的空泛谴责“反对和平事业的宣传”的提案，也被大会的多数所通过，苏联等国弃权。
    表决结束后，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基发表声明，解释投票的理由说：大会所通过的美、英等国的联合提案，虽然有着响亮的名称，但是实际上连任何造福和平的实际行动的影子也没有。这个提案中规避了禁止原子武器这个最重要的基本问题，整个提案仅仅是说建立国际管制。我们过去和现在一直在坚持无条件禁止原子武器和其他大规模屠杀人民的工具，以及建立严格的国际管制，但是我们认为这不能仅仅限于提一提国际管制，而规避禁止原子武器的问题，因为无论如何管制一种并不禁止的东西是不可能的，人们总不能在原子武器还没有禁止的时候就管制这种禁令的实施呀！维辛斯基指出：作出这种决定，其原因在于美国的外交政策，它并不想减轻重重地压在纳税人肩上的税收负担，而是要加紧军备竞赛，存储原子弹等等。
    维辛斯基继称：从反对新战争宣传的观点看来，已通过的这个提案也是不能令人满意的。他再次提出美国的战争歇斯底里已越发厉害，新战争宣传已在加紧。他说：我们必须采取紧急措施来结束罪恶的战争宣传。苏联政府认为它有责任继续与新战争挑拨者作斗争，并且总的说来为和平而斗争。苏维埃社会主义国家自它成立的第一天起，就顽强地始终不渝地在从事这个斗争。苏联政府领袖在一九二五年说过：我们不要做欺凌弱者的铁锤，也不愿做被强者压迫的铁砧。两者我们都不要，我们要的是和平。维辛斯基然后说：这就是为什么苏联代表团要对美、英等国联合提案提出若干修正案，来停止军备竞赛，制止战争歇斯底里，禁止战争宣传等的理由。美英多数并不想听我们这个忠告。维辛斯基结语中说：苏联将继续为和平而斗争。
    乌克兰代表团团长巴拉诺夫斯基在解释投票理由时称：乌克兰代表团一贯坚决要求通过苏联的提案，因为它认为以和平友好地解决国际纷歧的政策为基础的巩固和平与安全的措施，无疑地可以成为阻止散播新战争宣传的严重障碍，成为阻挡帝国主义者的侵略行为的绊脚石。然而美国和其他一些有势力的国家却不要走这条路。巴拉诺夫斯基说：尽管大会的多数否决了苏联所提出的提案和对美、英等国联合提案所提出的修正案，乌克兰代表团仍将与苏联及人民民主国家的代表团一起，继续更加坚决不渝地为和平、为巩固各国人民间的友谊与合作、为反对发动另一次战争而斗争。
    美国表决机器在十七日全体会议上还匆匆通过南斯拉夫所提出的混淆侵略定义而有利于侵略者的所谓“战争爆发时各国所负义务”案，通过将苏联所提出明确规定侵略定义的提案交予大会国际法委员会研究。甚至苏联所提国际法委员会应在联合国第六届大会以前提出其研究侵略定义的结果的修正案，也被美英多数所否决。乌克兰、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克代表在解释投票理由时指出：把苏联提案交予国际法委员会研究的决定说明：某些国家不希望有一个侵略定义，因为这个定义可能阻挡它们发动侵略。
    美英多数同时在十七日全体会议上通过将南斯拉夫提出成立篡夺安理会职权的所谓“常设斡旋委员会”的提案，交予非法的“小型联大”，苏联等国投票反对。
    十六日全体会议讨论前意大利殖民地利比亚问题。埃及、加拿大等十三国所提出的规定使利比亚获得独立，但并未为防止英法管理当局分裂利比亚的企图提供必要保证的提案，在十七日为大会多数所通过，苏联及人民民主国家弃权。苏联为确保利比亚的统一与独立而提出的，规定利比亚各部分统一成一个国家并建立全国的立法及行政机构，一切外国军队在三个月内撤出利比亚、以及撤除利比亚军事基地的提案，竟为美英多数所否决。
