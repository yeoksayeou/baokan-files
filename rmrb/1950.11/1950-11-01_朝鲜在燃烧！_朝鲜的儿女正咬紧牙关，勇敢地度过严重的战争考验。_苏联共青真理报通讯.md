Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th TASS dispatch: Komsomolskaya Pravda published a dispatch from its special correspondent in Korea, Kosin, entitled "Korea is Burning."

    Kosin wrote: Not long ago, I attended a rally in a certain town in North Korea, where Kim Il-sung's speech to all the Korean people was specifically discussed. A young woman stepped onto the podium and said: "In this war, I lost my husband and brother. My husband died in the battle near Daegu, and my brother was killed by the Americans in Seoul. Yesterday, I also saw my father off to the front lines. He is already old, but he requested permission to join the army. He said before leaving: Americans can make us shed a lot of blood, but they can never turn Koreans into slaves. We would rather die than live a life of slavery again."

    Speakers at the meeting included car drivers, elementary school teachers, grocery store owners, and fishermen, as well as representatives of the People's Committee, representatives of the Korean Workers' Party, and youth representatives from the town. Their speeches were not long, but when people's hearts are filled with deep love for their country, a few words can express a lot of meaning. The difficulties and trials suffered in the war have strengthened these people's invincible belief in justice and the cause of the people.

    Kosin continued: Recently, in the half-destroyed towns of North Korea, in the residential areas along the bombed roads, and in the air-raid shelters that have replaced the destroyed homes, I have encountered many people. Nowhere did I see any signs of panic or confusion. The sons and daughters of Korea are gritting their teeth, bravely enduring the severe test of war. Confidence in justice and the invincibility of their cause inspires everyone, making them brave and strong.

    Kosin emphasized: Despite the severe difficulties, the People's Army has not stopped fighting for even a minute. The command maintains firm and effective control over the army, and they are retreating to new defense lines in order to wear down the enemy's forces. Well-trained reserves have been dispatched from the rear to the front lines. Several large and small units remaining in South Korea are still fighting behind enemy lines. They are seizing American weapons and ammunition, threatening the American garrison, and liberating villages, towns, and entire counties.

    Kosin concluded: The entire Korean people are rising up to help the heroic People's Army, and the deep sympathy and support of hundreds of millions of people around the world strengthens the Korean people's confidence in victory.

　　朝鲜在燃烧！
    朝鲜的儿女正咬紧牙关，勇敢地度过严重的战争考验。
    苏联共青真理报通讯
    【新华社三十一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十九日电：共青真理报刊载该报驻朝鲜特派记者科辛的题为《朝鲜在燃烧》的通讯。
    科辛写道：不久以前，我在朝鲜北部某个城镇参加了一次集会，会上专门讨论金日成将军向全朝鲜人民发表的演说。一位年青的妇女走上讲台说：“在这次战争中，我失去了丈夫和兄弟。我的丈夫在大邱附近的战役中牺牲了，我的兄弟在汉城被美国人打死了。昨天，我又送别我的父亲到前线去。他已经年老了，但是他请求允许他去参军。他在临别时说：美国人可以使我们流很多的血，但是他们永远不能使朝鲜人变为奴隶。我们宁死也不愿再过奴隶生活。”
    在会上发表演说的有汽车司机、小学教员、杂货店老板和渔夫，还有人民委员会的代表，朝鲜劳动党的代表以及该镇的青年代表。他们的演说都不长，但是当人们内心充满着对祖国的深切的热爱的时候，很少的几句话便可以表达很多的意思。战争中所受的困难与考验，已加强了这些人民对公理与人民事业的不可战胜的信念。
    科辛继称：最近，在朝鲜北部的半毁灭了的城镇里，在被炸毁了的道路旁的居住区里，在代替被毁灭了的住所的防空壕里，我碰到了许多人。任何地方，我都没有看到慌张或混乱的迹象。朝鲜的儿女正咬紧牙关，勇敢地度过严重的战争考验。对公理及自己的事业不可战胜的信心，鼓舞着每一个人，使他变得勇敢与坚强。
    科辛着重指出：虽然有严重的困难，人民军甚至没有停止过一分钟的战斗。指挥部对军队仍然保持着坚定而有效的控制，他们为了消耗敌人的兵力而撤退到新的防线。训练优良的后备军已从后方开赴前线。留在朝鲜南部的若干大大小小的部队，仍在敌人后方作战。他们缴获着美军的武器弹药，威胁着美国的守军，解放着村镇及整个县区。
    科辛结语称：全朝鲜人民都在奋起援助英雄的人民军，全世界亿万人民的深切的同情和声援，加强了朝鲜人民对胜利的信心。
