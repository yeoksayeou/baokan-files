　　Xinhua News Agency, November 10th: TASS, London, November 7th – The Daily Mirror published a dispatch from its Seoul correspondent, Greenlees, on November 7th with the prominent headline "Stop This Barbarity!"

　　Greenlees wrote: In six days, military courts in Seoul alone have adjudicated 267 cases, including 84 death sentences and 94 prison sentences ranging from ten years to life imprisonment.

　　In the Seoul area, 5,000 civilians are crammed into prisons awaiting trial.

　　During interrogations, the police use rifle butts to beat the arrested unconscious in an attempt to extract confessions. The prisons holding these arrested people are overcrowded. A small room of fifteen feet long and nine feet wide holds sixty people. In another room, there are fifty-four women and twelve babies. In most of the rooms, at least forty people cannot lie down. They have to squat painfully. Many mothers are holding nursing infants.

　　In the prisons of the Seoul area, about three hundred children are imprisoned with their mothers. I saw a young woman in a room holding a baby who was only six hours old. In another room, some women were crying because they had not had water for four days. They were ragged and shivering from the cold.

　　The prisoners are tried in batches of forty. The judges are three people – two army officers and a civil official. The prosecutor and defense lawyer are both appointed by the government. In more than a hundred cases, no witnesses for the defendants appeared, and the hostile attitude of the official defendant's advocate was only slightly less than that of the prosecutor. No indictments were read.

　　I witnessed the execution of twenty-five men and two women. The prisoners were dragged out with their hands tied behind their backs. They were pushed onto two open trucks. The prisoners were forced to kneel on the trucks with their heads down. Anyone who looked up was beaten on the head with a rifle butt.

　　On a small mountain four miles from Seoul, they were dragged in batches to a shallow beach and then shot to death. One prisoner shouted "Long Live the People's Government of North Korea" before he died.

　　Xinhua News Agency, November 4th: TASS, London, November 2nd – According to a dispatch from the special correspondent of the Daily Telegraph and Morning Post in Seoul, patriotic people are being arrested in large numbers throughout South Korea and some areas of North Korea. The reporter said: Although no official total figures have been released, the number of people arrested has reached tens of thousands. According to sources in the Rhee Syngman government, more than ten thousand people have been arrested in Seoul alone.

　　The reporter said: "From my personal observations in Seoul and other parts of Korea, the conditions in many prisons run by the South Korean authorities are extremely bad. The interrogation methods are very cruel. I have personally seen police officers beating prisoners. According to reliable non-Korean officials, they have also witnessed worse abuse." The reporter pointed out: "The abuse of prisoners is also frequently inflicted on prisoners of war."

### 英记者汉城通讯  揭露美李匪帮暴行  大批妇孺在监狱里冻得发抖

    揭露美李匪帮暴行
    大批妇孺在监狱里冻得发抖
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社伦敦七日电：十一月七日，每日镜报以醒目字体刊载其驻汉城记者格林利斯的通讯，标题是“制止这种野蛮行为！”。
    格林利斯写道：在六天中，仅汉城一地的军事法庭，就判决了二百六十七件案子，其中有八十四件死刑，九十四件自十年至无期徒刑为期不等的监禁。
    在汉城地区，有五千平民被堆挤在监狱里，等待着受审。
    警察局在进行审讯时，为了企图逼出口供，用枪托把被捕者痛打得昏了过去。监禁这些被捕者的监狱已有人满之患。在一间十五英尺长九英尺宽的小屋子里要关六十个人。在另一间屋子里面有五十四个妇女和十二个婴儿。在大多数的小屋子里，至少有四十个人不能躺下。他们不得不痛苦地蹲着。许多母亲抱着吃奶的婴儿。
    在汉城地区的监狱里，约有三百个儿童和他们的母亲一同被关在监狱里。我曾在一间小屋子里看到一个青年妇女抱着一个刚生下来六小时的婴儿。在另一间小屋里，有些妇女在啼哭，她们已经四天没有喝水了。她们衣衫褴褛，冻得发抖。
    囚犯们受审时是四十人一批。审判官是三个人——两个陆军军官和一个文职官员。检察官和辩护律师都是政府指定的。在一百多案件中，没有被告的人证出庭，而官方的被告辩护人的敌视态度只稍逊于检察官。没有宣读什么起诉书。
    我曾看到二十五个男子和两个妇女被执行死刑。囚犯们双手倒缚地被拖出去。他们被推上两辆敞篷卡车。囚犯们被迫跪在卡车上，低着头。谁要抬头向上看，就要被用枪托照准头上痛打。
    在距汉城四英里的小山上，他们被一批批地拖向一个浅滩旁边，然后用枪打死。一个囚犯临死时高呼“北朝鲜人民政府万岁”。
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社伦敦二日电：据每日电讯与晨邮报合刊特派记者的汉城通讯，南朝鲜各地与北朝鲜的某些地区正大事逮捕爱国志士。该记者说：虽然还没有官方发表的总数字，但被捕的人数已达数万。据李承晚政府人士谈，仅在汉城一地，被捕的已超过万人。
    记者说：“据我个人在汉城和朝鲜其他地区的观察，南朝鲜当局所办的许多监狱情况极端恶劣。审讯的手段非常残酷。我曾亲眼看见警察殴打犯人。据可靠的非朝鲜官员说，他们还目睹过更恶劣的虐待。”该记者指出：“对犯人的虐待还时常施于战争俘虏。”
