　　"As long as we rely on the masses, we have nothing to fear!"
　　Record of Militia Hero Wei Zhitian
　　Wu Yousong
　　Comrade Wei Zhitian is from Shuangdian District, Rudong County, Northern Jiangsu, and came from a poor peasant family. He worked as a grinder for thirteen years. In 1941, when the New Fourth Army arrived in Rudong, he joined the work; in July of the same year, he gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party and successively served as Director of the Farmers' Association, Township Head, Deputy of the District Team, and Secretary of the District Committee. He is currently the Director of the Rudong County Public Security Bureau. Whether in terms of security, bandit suppression, or special agent elimination, he maintains close contact with the masses.

　　"We are like fish and water with the masses. If the enemy wants to catch me, we are not afraid of him because we have the masses." These are the words Comrade Wei Zhitian used to educate guerrilla cadres when he persisted in the struggle against the enemy in 1947.

　　In the spring of 1947, Chiang Kai-shek's 49th Army used three to five battalions to "encircle and suppress," "clear and suppress," "station and suppress," and "jointly encircle and search" our Rudong guerrilla隊; and carried out assassinations with special agents, the situation was very tense. The heroic and resourceful Comrade Wei Zhitian led the guerrillas and the masses at this time to carry out a life-and-death arduous struggle with the enemy. Initially, some cadres and the masses expressed timidity, thinking that they could not persevere. Comrade Wei, with the spirit of sharing life and death and sharing weal and woe, educated everyone and loudly proposed to everyone: "Don't be afraid! I will never leave, as long as there is Jing'an District, there will be our footprints!" This further strengthened the fighting will of the cadres and the masses. Once, the enemy "cleared and suppressed" Yangzhang Township with two or three battalions, he led the guerrillas to launch four consecutive attacks, killing the enemy and causing them to flee in a panic. Another time, the enemy set up strongholds in the areas of Yaoshi Temple, Gongjia Bridge, and Tangjiazhuang, preparing to "station and suppress." Therefore, the masses closely relied on Comrade Wei, saying: "Comrade Wei can win battles and outflank the enemy, we feel relieved to follow him." Indeed, he always took advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness to cleverly launch a sudden attack from behind the enemy, making the enemy unable to attend to both the head and the tail. The enemy said: "There are many field armies in Jing'an District, and they are really powerful in combat!"

　　When the enemy focused on "stationing and suppressing" and "mobile clearing and suppressing" in the district, the Party assigned him the task of persevering in Jing'an District. He immediately made a guarantee: "If I am greedy for life and fear death, and do not persist in the struggle, what face do I have to see the common people?" He educated and mobilized everyone: Persisting in the struggle is for the masses and for ourselves, whoever is a hero come with me! The guerrillas became as lively as dragons and tigers after his encouragement. In order to eliminate more enemies, he contacted nearby guerrilla隊 such as Wu Gongjing, Dai Wuze, and Wu Jingchun to counterattack the enemy nine times; during the "Grand Suppression," he misled the enemy three times, causing them to kill each other. Although his guerrillas won many victories, he never boasted, often saying: "We can only achieve such victories under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao and with the support of the masses." Sometimes he comforted the guerrillas, saying: "Don't be afraid of fighting, as long as you aim the gun well, you will definitely kill the enemy. If the enemy comes in large numbers, we will turn around and pounce on them from behind..." At that time, under his leadership and education, the cadres and masses realized that the enemy was like a poisonous snake, if you don't kill it, it will bite you. Therefore, everyone was united closely.

　　In order to solve the food problem for the troops and the masses, he often organized the masses to exchange labor for production; at the same time, they took turns to scout the enemy's situation. When the grain matured, he organized the militia and youth to rush to harvest and quickly hide it.

　　His series of victories were obtained in this way. But when you ask him about combat methods, his answer is very simple: "As long as we rely on the masses, we have nothing to fear."

　　“只要依靠群众，什么都不怕！”
    记民兵英雄魏志田
    吴友松
    魏志田同志是苏北如东县双甸区人，贫农出身，做过十三年打磨匠。一九四一年，新四军到了如东，他即参加了工作；同年七月，他光荣的加入了中国共产党，历任农会主任、乡长、区队副、区委书记等职。现任如东县公安局长。不论在治安、剿匪肃特各方面，都与群众保持着密切的联系。
    “我们跟群众象鱼跟水一样。敌人要捉我，我们有群众就不怕他。”这是魏志田同志在一九四七年坚持对敌斗争的时候，用以教育游击干部的几句话。
    一九四七年春天，蒋匪四十九军用三个至五个营的兵力，向我如东游击队“兜剿”、“清剿”、“驻剿”、“合围搜剿”；并以特务进行暗杀活动，情势十分紧张。英勇机智的魏志田同志，就在这时候领导游击队和群众，与敌人作你死我活的艰苦斗争。最初，某些干部与群众表示胆怯，认为不能坚持下去。魏同志即抱着同生死共患难的精神，向大家进行教育，并向大家响亮的提出：“不要怕！我绝对不走，只要有景安区，就有我们的足迹在！”这样就更加坚定了干部与群众的斗争意志。有一次，敌人以两三个营的兵力“清剿”洋涨乡，他便率领着游击队连续出击四次，把敌人杀得个落花流水，狼狈逃窜。又有一次，敌人在药师庵、宫家桥、唐家庄一带按下据点，准备“驻剿”。于是，群众就紧紧地靠在魏同志的周围，他们说：“魏同志能打胜仗，包抄敌人，我们跟着他就放心了。”的确，他总是乘敌人不备的时候，机智地在敌人背后来一个猛扑，弄得敌人顾到了头顾不了尾。敌人说：“景安区有很多野战军，打仗真厉害！”
    敌人重点“驻剿”、“机动清剿”该区的时候，党便交给他坚持景安区的任务。他立即提出了保证：“要是我贪生怕死，不坚持斗争，我还有什么脸见老百姓？”他教育、鼓动大家：坚持斗争是为群众、为自己，谁是英雄好汉跟我来！游击队员们经他一鼓励，都生龙活虎似的活跃起来了。为了要消灭更多的敌人，他联络附近的吴公经、戴五泽、吴景春等游击队，反击敌人九次；在“大会剿”中，曾有三次使敌人迷失方向自相残杀。他的游击队虽然屡次获得胜利，但他从不自夸，常说：“我们只有在共产党、毛主席英明领导和群众的支援下，才会得到这样的胜利。”有时他慰勉游击队员们说：“打仗不要怕，只要把枪瞄准好，定能打死敌人。敌人大批来，我们就转到他后面去猛扑……”。当时，干部群众在他的领导与教育下，都认识到敌人好比一条毒蛇，你不打死它，它就要咬你。因此大家团结得紧紧的。
    为要解决部队与群众的口粮，他经常组织群众一面换工生产；一面轮流侦探敌情。到粮食成熟的时候，就组织民兵、青年突击抢收，快打快藏。
    他的一连串胜利就是这样获得的。但是当你问到他作战方法的时候，他的回答却很简单：“只要依靠群众，什么都不怕。”
