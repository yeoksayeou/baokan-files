　　Telegraph Agency Reveals US Imperialist Strategic Plan for Aggression Against China
    US Imperialism Attempts to Launch Attacks Against Mainland China Using Korea, Vietnam, and Other Places
    [Xinhua News Agency, New York, 3rd] The Telegraph Agency, New York, 2nd: A senior military figure close to former Secretary of Defense Johnson, who recently resigned, told the Telegraph Agency about the nature of the strategic plan to be used "if military action were to be taken against China." The Telegraph Agency has learned that the Korean War was planned by a group of generals in the US Joint Chiefs of Staff headed by Bradley. This was discussed and approved at a meeting held by Bradley and General MacArthur in February of this year, when important officers of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff inspected several regions in the Far East. After they returned to the United States, the plan was redrafted at a meeting of the "National Security Council" and approved by President Truman. In early June, a draft final version was sent to MacArthur. The plan is divided into two parts. The first part details the strategic importance of Korea and Taiwan in achieving the United States' basic goals in the "struggle against the expansion of Asian communism" and in "protecting American economic interests in Asia." The second part discusses changes in the political situation, predicting that these changes may occur in the Far East this year. The last two changes involve the second half of this year and the beginning of next year, and take into account direct "military intervention in China" with the participation of American troops. They detail the importance of bases in Korea and Taiwan in this operation. The US High Command recommends using Korean territory and Korean troops to conduct operations in Manchuria and certain areas of the North as part of the strategic plan. The territories and military bases of Indochina, Burma, and Hong Kong will be used as bases on the southern front for attacking South China. If necessary, strong American forces will be sent to Indochina along with Kuomintang and Japanese "volunteer divisions." Their operational purpose will be to open the road to South China and prevent any threat from the Viet Minh forces. Taiwan occupies an important position in this plan. Strong paratrooper forces will be transported from there to areas around Shanghai and other areas in Central and South China.

　　电通社揭露美帝侵华战略计划
    美帝图利用朝越等地向我国大陆发动进攻
    【新华社三日讯】电通社纽约二日讯：接近最近辞职的前国防部长詹逊的一位高级军界人士把关于“一旦要在中国采取军事行动”时将用的战略计划的性质告诉电通社。电通社获悉，朝鲜的战事是由布莱德雷为首的美国参谋总部的一批将军们策划的。这是在今年二月布莱德雷与麦克阿瑟将军举行的会议上讨论并通过的，当时美国参谋总部的重要军官们曾视察远东的几个地区。在他们返美后，该计划在“全国安全委员会”的会议上重新起草并经杜鲁门总统批准。六月初，一份草案定本送交麦克阿瑟。该计划分两部分，头一部分详细谈到朝鲜和台湾对于达成美国在“反对亚洲共产主义扩张的斗争”中的基本目标和对于“保护美国在亚洲的经济利益”的战略重要性。另一部分讨论政治形势的变化，预料，这些变化今年可能在远东发生。最后的两个变化涉及今年下半年和明年初，并计算到以美国军队的参加“在中国进行”直接的“军事干涉”。它们详述了朝鲜、台湾的基地在这种作战中的重要性。美国高级指挥部建议利用朝鲜领土和朝鲜军队在满洲和北方某些地区进行作战，作为战略计划的一部分。印度支那、缅甸、和香港的领土以及军事基地将被用作进攻华南的南方前线上的基地。必要时，强大的美国军队将与国民党和日本的“志愿师”一起被派往印度支那。他们的作战目的将是打开通往华南的道路并阻止越盟军的任何威胁。台湾在这计划中占着一个重要的地位。强大的伞兵部队将由那里运往上海周围地区及华中华南的其他地区。
