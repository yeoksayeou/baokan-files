　　The Shattered Dreams of the American Representatives to the United Nations
    Yate Xierdes
    The powerful voice of New China evoked unpleasant memories for Warren Austin, the head of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations.

    China is telling the American imperialists: Hands off Chinese territory. Upon hearing this, Austin would silently recall the obedient Chinese government with which he, as a company lawyer, had negotiated deals long ago.

    For example, Austin would remember the time he went to Beijing to negotiate a $100 million loan to Chinese warlords. The loan was originally intended to return to the Americans' hands. Americans were to build a railway, which would be operated by Americans. This happened in 1916, in the good old days before the ordinary people led by Mao Zedong drove out foreign privileged individuals!

    The voice of New China also evoked painful memories for U.S. representative John Foster Dulles.

    When Dulles heard the Chinese people demanding the return of Taiwan, he must have thought of the days when his grandfather, John Foster, helped Japan extort this rich island from China. This happened in 1895, when his grandfather served as the official advisor to the Chinese delegation negotiating peace after the Sino-Japanese War. Moreover, his grandfather often boasted in his writings about how he forced the Chinese government, which wanted to delay, to give up the island.

    Dulles would have fond memories of the defunct Qing Dynasty government. For example, he would remember that in 1907, the Chinese delegation to the Hague Conference invited him to serve as secretary. At that time, he was only a 19-year-old boy who did not know a single Chinese character.

    No More "Water Buffaloes"

    But those days are gone. The privileges of the Standard Oil Trust, where Dulles had long served, are also gone. Dulles is the chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation's board of directors, holding hundreds of millions of dollars worth of oil company stocks. But the profits that Standard Oil, which sailors used to protect at the cost of American lives, could obtain from China are gone.

    The solemn voice of a reborn China, the solemn voice of the revolutionary colonial peoples of Southeast Asia, must have also surprised and disappointed Henry Cabot Lodge, a new representative in the U.S. delegation to the United Nations.

    Lodge could not understand: What had happened to those nations he himself had described as "water buffaloes" who were born to "endure and obey"? (The quoted phrases are from Lodge's writings.)

    Lodge remembered his contemptuous assessment of the East Asian peoples during a trip long ago. In 1920, during President Hoover's administration, this young, wealthy Boston aristocrat visited China and the Philippines. After returning home, he told the readers of Hub Magazine (January 1930 issue):

    "...Whenever the Northerners who love to work and overcome all difficulties come into contact with the tropical people who love obedience and endurance, the tropical people always succumb."

    This advocate of Northern racial superiority also said:

    "...To mock this extremely natural phenomenon, and to talk about whether it is right or wrong, is as fruitless as mocking the change of seasons. It should be acknowledged that this is a fact..."

    The Shattering of the Myth

    Now Lodge noted with distress that this "fact" no longer exists. Subjugation has come to an end. The senator still voted to support armed intervention in Korea, Vietnam, and the Philippines, regardless of everything.

    How different is the present from the era when he was convinced that the nations of the Far East could never manage themselves!

    As late as 1943, in the middle of the war against Germany and Japan, Lodge was still clamoring for the plunder of colonies. He told the Senate that in order to defeat the Axis powers, and also for the sake of (the) oil, rubber, and tin (found in Southeast Asia), we had to fight.

    The shattering of the myth of white supremacy in the Far East must be particularly painful for this aristocratic UN representative who despises people of color. Because Lodge once used words even the Nazi racial theorist Rosenberg would have envied to describe the Filipinos (who are carrying out a revolution).

    Lodge wrote in Hub Magazine against intermarriage between Americans and colonial peoples.

    He wrote in 1930: "Americans should not marry Filipinos, except among the lower classes where it has become a custom."

    Lodge contemptuously pointed out that we "do not socially recognize" the offspring of American-Filipino marriages.

    This UN representative, Lodge, would also not "socially recognize" an American coal miner.

    The strong voice of China and the demands of the revolutionary colonial peoples for independence and equality must also have disappointed Alabama Senator John J. Sparkman, who was sent to the Flushing Meadow UN General Assembly by President Truman.

    Sparkman had placed his entire political life on the myth of white supremacy, which has now gone bankrupt.

    This Southern senator often voted against resisting discriminatory practices against black people in Congress when that system was in peril. Sparkman sided with the American Federation of Labor on orthodox "labor" bills, but when it came to bills against poll taxes, lynching, and racial discrimination in schools, he would turn his thumbs down.

    Let us think about what Sparkman should do when Mrs. Sampson of Chicago sits next to him. Mrs. Sampson is a new alternate representative nominated to the United Nations by Truman.

    Mrs. Sampson is black, and she does support American imperialism. It is said that she once said that she would rather be a black person in the United States (although there is a system of discrimination against black people) than a citizen of any other country. But for white supremacists, she is first and foremost a black person.

    The voice of New China will also disturb the mood of the fifth representative in the American delegation—Mrs. Roosevelt. She remembers how her late husband signed his name to the international agreement stipulating that Taiwan be returned to China. That solemn agreement has been torn up by President Truman, who appointed Mrs. Roosevelt to the United Nations.

    Wall Street's Mission to Austin

    Regarding Austin's old loan negotiation in old China, we can now provide some more detailed information. Because Austin is the leader, the formal representative of American imperialism in the United Nations. Moreover, his $100 million negotiation can be said to be the culmination of three generations of American interference and conspiracy against that old power in East Asia.

    Austin's negotiations were conducted during the First World War, at a time when the United States had become a creditor nation and an imperialist power due to the huge profits from arms.

    China, with its amazing resources, vast China, opened its doors to international bandits. Chinese traitors offered up stolen goods for a reward.

    The revolution led by the great patriot Sun Yat-sen overthrew the Qing Dynasty. But China was still not ruled by the people. Sun Yat-sen was driven out, and a dictatorial old minister, Yuan Shikai, became the president of China.

    This corrupt feudal ruler wanted to sell the resources of his country in exchange for hard, cold dollars. Therefore, he signed a prepayment loan and railway contract with the new American International Banking Consortium. Austin—the lawyer for this Vermont consortium—was the representative.

    The American International Banking Consortium was formed in 1916 with the aim of taking over abandoned properties in bankrupt countries. Its "scope is the whole world." Its directors included Wall Street millionaires such as Standard Oil Company and National City Bank's Pierce Rockefeller, the Loeb banker Otto Kahn, the meat king Ogden Armour, the Morgan Telegraph monopoly chairman Theodoru Vail, and so on.

    When Austin set out for China to conduct the final negotiations, he must have been eagerly relying on the authority of American imperialism.

    Yuan Shikai promised to grant the consortium the management rights of the thousands of miles of new railways to be built with the loan.

    These railway management rights meant control over China's economic life.

    The contract stipulated that the $100 million loan would be used for railway construction, and another $30 million loan would be used for repairing China's Grand Canal. The expenditure of these funds would be entirely supervised by Americans. Semes Carey Railway Company and Saint Paul Canal Company (also represented by Austin) would contract construction projects on the "cost-plus" principle desired by Wall Street.

    The more "cost," the more "plus." The amount of the cost was determined by an American auditor.

    Austin's Outdated Education

    The loan was to be repaid by the Chinese government issuing bonds, and Wall Street speculators could freely shift the burden onto the American public.

    When this piece of "fat meat" from China was almost in the mouths of Austin's bosses, a change occurred. The Russian and Japanese governments came out in opposition. The negotiation fell through.

    All of Austin's business in China was lost. But under those circumstances, his Wall Street bosses did not care. The United States joined the World War, and the American International Banking Consortium obtained a contract to build the Hog Island shipyards in Philadelphia, also on the basis of "cost-plus" fraud, which later involved astonishing cases of corruption.

    The chief representative of the American delegation to the United Nations has gained a kind of understanding of China, which is now outdated. Yuan Shikai's China, along with its Quislings and feudal warlords, is gone.

    Today's China cannot be threatened or bought. The people of the Far East need to get along with the American people in a friendly manner. But they firmly demand the same rights to independence and equality as those guaranteed by the American Declaration of Independence.

　　联合国美国代表们破灭了的旧梦
    亚特·希尔德斯
    新中国的强有力的声音唤起了美国出席联合国代表团团长华伦·奥斯汀的不愉快的回忆。
    中国正在告诉美国帝国主义者：不许对中国的领土动手。奥斯汀一听到，就会默默地想起很久以前他以一家公司的律师的身份接洽过买卖的那个百依百顺的中国政府。
    举一个例，奥斯汀会记起他到北京去谈判贷款一亿美元给中国军阀们那个时候。那笔借款本来是要回到美国人的手里。由美国人去建筑一条铁路，这一条铁路将由美国人经营。此事发生在一九一六年，远在毛泽东所领导的普通人民逐出外国特权者以前的好时代！
    新中国的声音同时也唤起了美国代表约翰·福斯特·杜勒斯痛苦的回忆。
    当杜勒斯听到中国人民要求收回台湾的时候，他一定会想到他祖父约翰·福斯特曾帮助日本向中国勒索过这个富庶海岛的日子。这件事发生在一八九五年，那时他的祖父在中日战争后充任中国和议代表团官方顾问。而且他的祖父曾在著作中常常夸耀他如何迫使本想拖延日子的中国政府放弃了这个海岛。
    杜勒斯对于那个已经完蛋的满清政府，是会发生津津有味的回忆的。譬如，他会记得一九○七年，出席海牙和会的中国代表团请他充任秘书。那时候他只是十九岁的孩子，一个中国字也不识。
    不再有“水牛”了
    但是那些日子已成过去了。杜勒斯长期任职的美孚火油托辣斯的特权也已成为过去了。杜勒斯是握有数亿美元火油公司股票的洛克菲勒基金董事会的主席。但是水兵们惯用美国人生命的代价去保护的美孚火油公司，从中国方面所可取得的收益已成过去了。
    再生的中国的严正的声音，东南亚革命的殖民地人民的严正的声音一定也使美国出席联合国代表团里一位新的代表亨利·卡布特·罗治感觉到惊讶与失望。
    罗治想不通：他自己曾用生来就该“忍受与服从”的“水牛”加以形容的那些民族发生了什么事？（引用的字句见罗治的著作）
    罗治记得他在好久以前的一次旅行中对于东亚各民族的轻蔑的估计。一九二○年胡佛总统当政时，这个年轻的百万巨富的波士顿贵族到过中国和菲律宾。回国后他对哈卜斯杂志（一九三○一月号）的读者说：
    “……每逢喜爱做事和克服一切的北方人与喜爱服从和忍耐的热带人发生接触的时候，热带的人总就屈服了。”
    这一位北方的人种优越论者还说：
    “……嘲骂这种极自然的现象，以及谈论它对与不对，是和嘲骂季节的变迁一样没有结果的。应该承认这就是事实……”
    神话的破灭
    现在罗治苦闷地注意到这一“事实”不复存在了。屈服已告终结。这位参议员还是不顾一切地投票赞成武装干涉朝鲜、越南与菲律宾。
    他确信着远东各民族永远不能管理自己的那个时代和现在有多大的不同呵！
    直到一九四三年，在对德日战争的中间，罗治还是叫嚣着对殖民地的掠夺。他告诉参议院说，为了击败轴心国，同时也为了（在东南亚发现的）石油、树胶和锡，我们非作战不可。
    白种优越权的神话在远东的破灭，对于这位轻蔑有色人种的贵族的联合国代表，必然是特别痛苦的。因为罗治有一次曾用过连纳粹种族论者罗森堡也会自叹不如的言语来说到菲律宾人（他们正在进行革命）。
    罗治曾在哈卜斯杂志中撰文反对美国与殖民地人民的通婚。
    他在一九三○年这样写道：“除了在下等人中已成为习惯以外，美国人不要和菲律宾人结婚。”
    罗治轻蔑地指出：我们“在社会上不承认”美国人与菲律宾人结婚所生的子孙。
    这位联合国代表罗治也不会“在社会上承认”一个美国煤矿工人的。
    中国的强而有力的声音和革命的殖民地人民争取独立与平等的要求，同时一定也使阿拉巴马州的参议员约翰·Ｊ·斯巴克曼感到了失望，他是被杜鲁门总统派到佛拉辛草地联合国大会去的。
    斯巴克曼曾把他的整个政治生命放在白种优越权的神话上，这神话今天已告破产了。
    当歧视黑人制度在国会中遭到抗拒而岌岌可危时，这一位南方的参议员经常投票加以反对。对于正统的“劳工”法案，斯巴克曼是与劳联站在一边的，但是轮到讨论反对人头税、私刑与学校中的种族歧视等法案时，他就要倒竖他的大拇指了。
    我们想一想等到芝加哥的森浦逊夫人坐在他旁边的时候，斯巴克曼该怎么办才好呵。森浦逊夫人是杜鲁门提名出席联合国的一位新的候补代表。
    森浦逊夫人是黑人，她的确也拥护美国帝国主义。据说她曾说过她宁愿做美国的黑人（虽然有歧视黑人的制度），不做别的任何国家的公民。但是对于白种优越论者来说，她首先是一个黑人。
    新中国的声音也会扰乱美国代表团中的第五位代表——罗斯福夫人的心绪。她记得她的亡夫在规定把台湾交回中国的国际协定上怎样签上了他的名字。那庄严的协定已被指派罗斯福夫人出席联合国的杜鲁门总统所撕毁了。
    华尔街授予奥斯汀的使命
    关于奥斯汀从前在旧中国办过的那次借款交涉，我们现在可以再供给一些更详细的资料。因为奥斯汀是团长，是联合国中美国帝国主义的正式代表人物。而且，他的一亿美元的交涉可以说是三个世代中间，美国对那东亚老大国家的干涉与阴谋的最高潮。
    奥斯汀的交涉是在第一次世界大战中进行的，那时候由于军火的巨额利润，美国变成了一个债权国和帝国主义国家。
    拥有惊人的富源的中国，广大的中国，向国际强盗们开放了门户。中国的卖国贼们为了一笔报酬把赃物奉献出去。
    伟大的爱国者孙中山所领导的革命推翻了满清。但是中国仍然不是由人民所统治的。孙中山被赶走，一个专制的老大臣袁世凯成了中国的总统。
    这一个腐败的封建昏君想把他的国家的资源出卖，换成硬崩崩的美元。因此他和那个新的美国国际银团签订了一项预付贷款与铁路合同。奥斯汀——这一个惠尔蒙特银团的律师——就是代表人。
    美国国际银团在一九一六年组成，其目的是要在破产的国土上接收弃置的财产。它的“范围是全世界”。它的董事包括像美孚火油公司和国家城市银行的皮尔斯·洛克菲勒，鲁爱普银行家奥图·凯恩，肉类大王奥登·阿摩尔，摩根电讯独占事业董事长费奥多·威尔等等一些华尔街的百万富翁。
    当奥斯汀出发到中国去进行最后谈判的时候，他一定是仗着美国帝国主义的威权而兴致勃勃的。
    用那笔贷款来建筑的数千英里新铁路的管理权，袁世凯是答应给予这个银团的。
    这些铁路的管理权就意味着对中国经济生活的控制。
    合同订明：一亿美元的贷款用于修筑铁路，另外三千万美元的贷款用于修治中国的大运河。这些钱的开支完全由美国人加以监督。塞姆斯·卡雷铁路公司与圣保尔运河公司（也是由奥斯汀代表着）则在华尔街所想望的“成本附加”的原则上承包建筑工程。
    “成本”愈多，“附加”就愈多。成本的多少是由一个美国的查账员来决定的。
    奥斯汀过时的教育
    贷款是要由中国政府发债券来偿还的，华尔街投机家可以随意把负担卸到美国公众的身上。
    当中国这块“肥肉”几乎进了奥斯汀后台老板的口中的时候，变卦发生了。俄国和日本政府出而反对。交涉落了空。
    奥斯汀在中国的生意全输了。但是在那样情形之下，他的华尔街后台老板并不在意。美国参加了世界大战，美国国际银团获得了在费城修建霍格岛船坞的合同，这也是根据“成本附加”的欺诈基础的，后来并发生了惊人的舞弊案。
    美国出席联合国代表团的首席代表曾经获得了一种关于中国的认识，这种认识，现在是过时了。袁世凯的中国，连同它的吉斯林分子和封建军阀，已成过去了。
    今天的中国是不能被威胁或者购买的。远东人民需要和美国人民友好地相处。但是他们坚决要求着与从前美国独立宣言所保证的独立与平等的相同的权利。（谭文瑞译自九月十七日美国工人日报）
