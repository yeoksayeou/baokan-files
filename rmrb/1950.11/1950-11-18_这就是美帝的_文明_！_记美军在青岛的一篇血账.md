This is the "Civilization" of American Imperialism!
    — An Account of American Troops’ Blood Debt in Qingdao

Today, as American imperialism ignites the criminal flames of aggression against China, every conscientious Chinese person cannot help but turn to a page they witnessed themselves in the thick blood debt ledger of American aggression against China.

Qingdao, this city of many misfortunes, has repeatedly suffered under the rule of imperialism, and it itself has been left with a bloody history of imperialist crimes. World War I transferred it from the hands of German imperialism to Japanese寇; after World War II, it fell into the clutches of American imperialism. The reactionary government condoned these wild beasts running rampant on that beautiful land. American beasts walked on the streets and rode in cars. They used American dollars and sold American goods. Good areas and streets were marked "Chinese Forbidden," and good houses were "Occupied by the American Government." All Chinese industries there collapsed. The Chiang bandits specially set up countless bars and brothels for their American masters to indulge in. Chinese female students dared not walk alone on the streets. The beasts often openly called Chinese people pigs. However, their own "civilized" behavior was indescribably lower than that of pigs. "Rape is not a big deal in civilized countries." That is what General Kirk of the U.S. Seventh Fleet told Kuomintang reporters. But excuse me, General of the "civilized" country, the people know that your "civilization" and shamelessness are really indistinguishable. Only the officials of the Chiang Kai-shek gang resent that they are not civilized enough; they enacted the dance rape case in Hankou. A seventeen-year-old female compatriot was gang-raped by American beasts on the streets of Qingdao. Afterwards, Kuomintang newspapers publicly announced the news that "in order to comfort the raped girl, the US military headquarters decided to give her 20 yuan as consolation money." No wonder some people shouted that American dollars are omnipotent!

Here, a car running over someone was not news; it was news if a person damaged the car. It is hard to imagine how fast these "civilized" American beast soldiers had to drive their cars. They cured their battle shock on the battlefield and used cars to charge in the peaceful streets of China, killing seven cheap Chinese people on a street in Qingdao in ten hours. The reactionary government had already set an official price for the lives of Chinese people for its master (American beasts): 5,000 US dollars for a life, 7,000 US dollars for a cow. Because human corpses cannot be cooked and eaten, they should of course be cheaper than cows.

In Qingdao, "protected" by the "civilized" American beasts, you would come across signs that read "Chinese Forbidden" and "Chinese Not Allowed." From the Qianhai pier in front of Pier No. 3, the Battery Garden, Taiping Bridge, the bathing beach, all the way to the Fushansuo Golf Course, a series of places were marked "Chinese Approaching Will Be Shot Without Question." Because these places were all too beautiful, the Kuomintang reactionary rulers were ashamed of themselves and offered them to their master with both hands.

"American guns are too good and easily go off. Chinese people are born poor and cannot afford to live. If they starve to death, it is better to die under the guns of the Allied forces, and their families can get some American dollars to live on." Do you doubt this sentence? We heard it with our own ears from Huang You, the police chief of the Chiang bandit Qingdao City Police Bureau. How fortunate the Chinese are to die under the guns of the Allied forces, and the Allied forces are not stingy with ammunition. Thus, one after another, in four years, the families of more than 700 lucky people received American dollars. It is a pity that the Chinese people are not greedy for American dollars at all and always cry and shout to avenge the dead. The corrupt military discipline of American imperialism can be regarded as the world's number one. Their soldiers take theft as a virtue, stealing large amounts of supplies from the warehouse and selling them to the Chinese people at low prices, and then falsely reporting losses when they return. Their military police then searched and looted on the streets. When they saw Chinese people wearing American military clothing, they would strip it off them in a robber-like manner. These despicable and shameless thugs, condoned by the Chiang Kai-shek traitors, strutted around on Chinese soil. But when the spearhead of our People's Liberation Army was pointed directly at Qingdao, they quickly tucked their tails between their legs and sneaked away, leaving a shameful memory for the Chinese people forever. The unspeakable hatred left by American imperialism in the hearts of the Chinese people, we have always endured in the past. Until today, the Chinese people have established their own regime and have their own strength. The long-suffering Chinese people, tempered and refined, have become incomparably strong. We can no longer be enslaved and humiliated, nor can we sit idly by and watch the Korean people, with whom we have grown up together in struggle and suffering, be bullied again. The will of our people has been clearly told to the aggressors by Foreign Minister Zhou, but the insane atrocities of the beasts have not diminished in the slightest. Then, these will be the days when we demand payment and revenge.

　　这就是美帝的“文明”！
    ——记美军在青岛的一篇血账
    今天，正当美帝国主义向中国烧起侵略的罪恶的火焰的时候，每一个有良心的中国人都会不由地在美帝侵华的一本厚厚的血账中，翻起自己所目睹的一页。
    青岛，这个多难的城市，曾一再受着帝国主义的统治，它本身为帝国主义留下了血腥的罪恶史。第一次世界大战，使它由德帝国主义手中转交给日寇；二次大战后，又沦入到美帝的魔掌下。反动政府纵容这些野兽豕奔在那美丽的河山，街上走的和汽车上坐的是美国野兽。用的是美金，卖的是美货。好的地区和街道写着“华人止步”，好的房子“美政府占用”。那里的中国工业全部倒闭。蒋匪们为它的美国主子专设了无数的酒巴间和暗娼，供野兽们淫乐。中国的女学生是不敢单独上街的。野兽们常在公开的场合叫中国人是猪。但是，它们自己“文明”的表现比起猪来要低到无法形容。“强奸，在文明的国家中不算什么了不起的事。”美国第七舰队的柯克将军就这样告诉国民党的记者们。但是对不起，“文明”国家的将军大人，人民知道你们的“文明”和无耻实在难分。只有蒋匪帮的官员们自怨自艾他们不够文明，他们扮演了一下汉口的跳舞强奸案。十七岁的女同胞在青岛的马路上便被美国野兽轮奸了。事后，国民党报纸公开发表消息“为了安慰被强奸的少女，美军司令部决定予以二十元的安慰金”。难怪又有人高呼美金万能了！
    在这里，汽车轧死人并不是新闻，而应该人轧坏了汽车才算是新闻。真难想像，这些“文明”的美国兽兵们要把汽车开得多么快。他们医好了在战场上的吃惊病，在中国和平的街市上，以汽车来冲锋，十小时内，在青岛的一条街上撞死了七个廉价的中国人。反动政府早为它的主子（美国野兽）订出了中国人生命的官价：人命一条，美元五千；牛一头，美元七千。因为人的尸身不能煮了当菜吃，当然应该比牛的价钱便宜。
    在“文明”的美国野兽们“保护”下的青岛，你到处会碰上：“华人止步”与“华人禁止入内”的牌子。从三号码头前海栈桥、炮台花园、太平桥、海浴场直到浮山所高尔夫球场这一连串的地方都是“华人接近枪杀不论”的。因为这些地方都太美丽了，国民党反动统治者自惭形秽，只有双手献给它的主子。
    “美国枪本来太好容易走火，中国人生来就穷命，活又活不起，假如饿死，还不如死在盟军枪下，家属反可以得点美金生活。”你怀疑这句话吗？我们却是亲耳听到蒋匪青岛市警察局长黄佑亲口说的。中国人何幸可以死到盟军枪下，盟军又不吝啬弹药，于是接二连三的，在四年中有七百多个幸运者的家属得到了美金。可惜的是中国人一点也不贪美金，总是那样哭天喊地要为死者报仇。美帝腐败的军纪可算是世界第一。它们的士兵以偷窃为美德，把仓库的一切物资大量的偷出来，低价卖给中国人民，回去伪报丢失。它们的宪兵便又在街上搜劫，见到中国人穿了美军衣物，就用强盗式的手段从中国人身上剥回去。这些卑鄙无耻的流氓强盗们，在蒋匪卖国贼的纵容下，它们在中国的土地上趾高气扬，但是当我们人民解放军的矛头直指青岛的时候，它们就赶快夹起尾巴偷偷的跑掉了，狼狈的丑态永远给中国人民留下了可耻的记忆。美国帝国主义在中国人民心里留下的诉说不清的仇恨，过去我们都一直隐忍着，直到今天，中国人民已建立了自己的政权，有了自己的力量，这饱受凌辱的中国人民，经过千锤百炼，力量已无比的壮大，我们不能再受奴役和凌辱，也不能坐视我们共同在苦难中斗争长大的朝鲜人民再受欺凌，我们人民的意志，周外长已明确地告诉侵略者，而野兽们的疯狂暴行仍丝毫未减，那么，这将是我们索债报仇的日子了。
