Record of American Military Aggression Against Taiwan

　　Since our country lodged a complaint with the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council regarding the United States' aggression against our territory of Taiwan, U.S. President Truman, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations Austin and others have repeatedly made shameless remarks in an attempt to deny and deceive about America's acts of aggression. However, these lies can never cover up the ironclad facts.

　　American aggression against Taiwan is part of its long-standing plan of aggression against all of China. Before June of this year, it adopted the method of providing money and weapons, using the hands of the Kuomintang traitorous bandit gang to control Taiwan; after U.S. President Truman issued the declaration of aggression on June 27, the method it adopted was openly and blatantly sending troops to directly invade.

　　According to existing materials, the amount of weapons and ammunition that the United States has aided the Kuomintang bandit gang in Taiwan since January of this year has been extremely large. Among them, the number of tanks alone, according to news disclosed by various news agencies from January to May, reached 718 (including M-8 type, M-5 type, and amphibious tanks). On January 10, the United States sold nearly 300 tanks and armored vehicles from the Ordance Corps in Ohio as surplus materials to the Kuomintang bandit gang. The cost of these tanks, excluding armament, was $58,000 each, and the price sold to the Kuomintang bandit gang was $1,000 each. These tanks were shipped to Taiwan in batches by the Turkish freighter Martin. The first batch of 75 vehicles was loaded in Philadelphia on January 10 and unloaded in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, on January 23 (United Press, Taipei, January 23). The second batch of 100 tanks and 100 armored vehicles passed through Honolulu on March 1 (Associated Press, March 1) and were unloaded in Kaohsiung on March 28 (Associated Press, Taipei, March 28). In addition, according to United Press, Vancouver, March 24, the Canadian ship Argo-wan left Vancouver for Taiwan with 75 tanks on board. Reuters, Baguio, March 23, quoted the Star Reporter as saying that 426 tanks were being shipped from the Philippines to Taiwan. United Press, Taipei, May 15, stated that 42 tanks were en route to Taiwan. The quantity of other weapons, ammunition and supplies is even more difficult to count. The above statistics are only based on public and incomplete materials, and the amount secretly transported must be more than this number. Now these murder weapons used to slaughter the people are still being continuously increased and transported.

　　After U.S. President Truman issued the declaration of aggression on June 27, U.S. aggression against Taiwan became open and direct.

　　The night before Truman issued the declaration (June 26), U.S. naval vessels invaded the Taiwan Strait (U.S. Information Service, Washington, June 27). On the afternoon of the 27th, a tactical formation of the Seventh Fleet, with a total of eight warships, appeared in the Taiwan Strait off Huoshaodao and Hongtouyu. On July 6, a group of "communications experts" from the Seventh Fleet arrived in Taiwan to establish radio communication equipment. On the 8th, Seventh Fleet Commander Struble arrived in Taiwan from Japan to confer with Chiang Kai-shek and other bandits. On the 16th, the U.S. Far East Command officially announced that the Seventh Fleet had begun "sea and air reconnaissance" in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. According to a report from Taipei on July 24 by a reporter from the New York Herald Tribune, the range of patrol activities by the U.S. fleet extended from the waters off Shantou, Guangdong, in the south to Qingdao, Shandong, in the north, covering a thousand miles of our coastline. After the United States expanded its war of aggression against Korea in August, the Seventh Fleet organized a special Strait Task Force Command. Originally, Colonel Miesemoe served as the acting commander with the rank of Brigadier General, and later Rear Admiral Plifort, captain of the St. Paul, was officially appointed as commander. On September 25, Plifort was transferred to the United States, and Brigadier General Kirk Ault was appointed as his successor. According to materials disclosed by the bandit Central News Agency and foreign news agencies, the Seventh Fleet ships that appeared in Taiwan one after another included the cruisers St. Paul, Juneau, and Worcester, the destroyers Bairei, DD-745, 858, 859, 73, 731, 747, 285, 765, 768, 860, and auxiliary ships Cimarron, Mistletoe, and 106. The ships of this Strait Task Force Command held "exercises" twice in the Taiwan Strait from September 5 to 9 and from September 18 to 21. Seventh Fleet Commander Struble even openly announced at the end of August that he had drafted a plan to prevent the Chinese People's Liberation Army from liberating its own territory, Taiwan Province. He said arrogantly: "I believe that by adopting the plan that has now been prepared, we will be able to prevent an 'invasion'." (United Press, Tokyo, August 29)

　　Regarding the air force's acts of aggression, the U.S. Thirteenth Air Force has been using the largest airport in Taiwan, Hsinchu Airport, as its base since the Japanese surrender. After Truman's statement, Thirteenth Air Force Commander General Sernar flew to Taiwan on August 4, and established a "liaison" organization within the Kuomintang Air Force Headquarters on the 7th. Later, it established a forward command post for the Thirteenth Air Force in Taiwan. The responsibility of this organization is to "handle liaison and related joint operations between the Chinese (Kuomintang bandit gang) and U.S. air forces at close range" (Kuomintang Central News Agency, Taipei, August 7). Before and after this, batches of U.S. aircraft flew to Taiwan from Okinawa and other places. The Kuomintang Taiwan Radio broadcast on August 6: "Six U.S. jet aircraft arrived in Taiwan on August 4. Taiwan will expand several airports for the use of the U.S. Air Force; however, the number of airports being expanded is still a secret. One of the many tasks underway is to lengthen the runways for jet aircraft and heavy bombers to take off and land. On August 6, another six jet aircraft passed over Taipei." After our country lodged a complaint with the UN Security Council in August, US planes briefly left Taiwan to Okinawa and other places, but returned to Taiwan for activities in September. On September 11, Major General Hall, commander of the U.S. Far East Bomber Command, flew from Clark Air Base in the Philippines to Taiwan to "inspect" air force-related matters.

　　The general organization directing the aggression against Taiwan is the "MacArthur Headquarters Military Liaison Group stationed in Taiwan," which was led by Major General Fox, Deputy Chief of Staff of MacArthur, who arrived in Taiwan on August 4. This "Liaison Group" was formally appointed and organized by MacArthur after he returned to Japan from Taiwan on August 1. The group officially began working in the Taiwan Defense Headquarters of the Kuomintang bandit gang on August 8, and was renamed the "U.S. Far East Military Inspection Group stationed in Taiwan" on the 16th. On August 22, MacArthur reassigned Kangkling, a senior official of the U.S. Far East Military Headquarters, as the head of the group. The scope of business and nature of work of this "Inspection Group" are the same as those of its predecessor, the "Liaison Group." In fact, it is an American military mission that commands the Chiang bandit army in Taiwan and the American aggressor army. Its internal organization is divided into four groups: personnel, intelligence, operations, and supply. The total personnel establishment is 50 officers and 75 soldiers below warrant officer (Kuomintang Central News Agency, Taipei, August 17). At the end of September, after the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution to discuss our country's accusation of American aggression on a regular basis, at the beginning of October, the U.S. government pretended to announce the "withdrawal" of this "Inspection Group" from Taiwan. Kangkling, as the head of the group, flew to Tokyo on October 6, but there was no further news about the remaining group. Moreover, according to a report by United Press, Taipei, October 3, quoting authoritative sources: "The recall of the Inspection Group does not affect Truman's order for the Seventh Fleet to patrol the Taiwan Strait, nor does it affect the work of the U.S. Thirteenth Air Force Squadron Liaison Office established at the same time as the Inspection Group." This shows that the so-called withdrawal is nothing more than a cover-up by the United States under the condemnation of the people of our country and progressive public opinion around the world.

　　In addition, there are two U.S. military aggression agencies in Taiwan. One is the military delegation headed by Major General Jarrett, whose open name is military attache. This delegation includes many officers from the army, navy, and air force. Their main task is to control and train the Kuomintang army, navy, and air force. The other is military advisors appearing under the name of "advisors" and "experts" of the "China Commercial International Corporation," including former U.S. Navy Admiral Kirk, Marine Corps Brigadier General Fet and air force experts, a total of forty or fifty people. After arriving in Taiwan one after another in mid-May, they immediately met with the responsible persons of the Kuomintang Command Headquarters. When Fox arrived in Taiwan, this group of experts and advisors also participated in the work of the U.S. Far East Military Inspection Group stationed in Taiwan. These facts all prove that the so-called commercial company advisors are just another name for military advisors.

　　All this shows that U.S. imperialism has carried out military aggression against Taiwan in our country, and is trying to turn Taiwan into a military base for its aggression against the mainland of our country. The Chinese people will never allow U.S. imperialism to invade Taiwan, and are determined to smash the U.S. aggression plan and liberate Taiwan.

　　美国军事侵略台湾的罪行录
    自从我国向联合国大会及安全理事会提出关于美国侵略我国领土台湾的控诉以后，美国总统杜鲁门、美国国务卿艾奇逊、美国驻联合国常任代表奥斯汀等人曾一再发表无耻的谈话，企图诋赖和狡骗美国的侵略行为，但是这些谎言绝掩盖不了铁证如山的事实。
    美国对台湾的侵略是它对全中国侵略计划中的一部分，是由来已久的。今年六月以前，它采取的方式是出钱、出武器，假国民党卖国匪帮之手，控制台湾；而在六月二十七日美国总统杜鲁门发表侵略声明以后，它采取的方式就是公开地和露骨地直接派兵侵略了。
    根据已有的材料，自今年一月以来，美国援助台湾国民党匪帮的武器军火数量是极其庞大的。其中仅坦克一项，据各通讯社一月至五月披露的消息统计，即达七一八辆（包括Ｍ——８型、Ｍ——５型和水陆两用坦克）。一月十日，美国以俄亥俄州逮玛军械库的坦克与装甲车近三百辆，作为剩余物资卖给国民党匪帮。这些坦克的造价不算武装每辆为五万八千美元，卖给国民党匪帮的价格是每辆一千美元。这些坦克分批由土耳其货轮马丁号装运赴台，第一批七十五辆于一月十日在费城装船，一月二十三日在台湾高雄卸载（合众社台北一月二十三日电）。第二批坦克一百辆和装甲车一百辆于三月一日过檀香山（美联社三月一日电），三月二十八日在高雄卸载（美联社台北三月二十八日电）。此外，根据合众社温哥华三月二十四日电，加拿大轮船亚哥文号载坦克七十五辆离温哥华驶台湾。路透社碧瑶三月二十三日电引《星报》（Star Reporter）消息称，四百二十六辆坦克正由菲运往台湾。合众社台北五月十五日电称，四十二辆坦克在运台途中。其他武器、军火和物资的数量更是难以计数。以上仅就公开的不完全的材料统计，秘密运送的当不止于此数。现在这些屠杀人民的凶器还在不断增加运送中。
    美国总统杜鲁门于六月二十七日发表侵略声明后，美国对台湾的侵略就成为公开的和直接的了。
    在杜鲁门发表声明的前一天（六月二十六日）夜间，美国海军舰只就侵入台湾海峡（美新闻处华盛顿六月二十七日电）。二十七日下午，第七舰队的一个战术编队共军舰八只即在海峡的火烧岛、红头屿出现。七月六日，第七舰队的一批“通讯专家”抵达台湾建立无线电联络设备。八日，第七舰队司令史枢波由日本抵达台湾，与蒋贼介石等进行会商。十六日，美国远东司令部正式宣布第七舰队已开始在台湾海峡与南海进行“海空侦察”。据纽约先驱论坛报记者七月二十四日自台北报道，美国舰队巡逻活动的范围是南起广东汕头海面、北至山东青岛的长达一千英里的我国海岸线。八月美国扩大侵略朝鲜的战争以后，第七舰队又组织了专门的海峡分队司令部，原由米斯摩上校以准将衔代理司令职权，后来正式由圣保罗号舰长平佛特少将任司令，九月二十五日平佛特调美，又以柯克奥准将继任司令。据匪中央社及外国通讯社所披露的材料统计，第七舰队舰船先后在台湾出现的有巡洋舰圣保罗号、朱诺号、瓦塞斯特号，驱逐舰拜雷号、ＤＤ七四五号、八五八号、八五九号、七三号、七三一号、七四七号、二八五号、七六五号、七六八号、八六○号，辅助舰西马龙号、麦里斯底奥号、一○六号等。这个海峡分队司令部的舰只，并于九月五日至九日与九月十八日至二十一日两次在台湾海峡举行“演习”。第七舰队的司令史枢波于八月底更公开宣布已拟就阻止中国人民解放军解放自己国土台湾省的计划。他狂妄地说：“我认为采用现在已经准备好的计划，我们是能够阻止‘入侵’的。”（合众社东京八月二十九日电）
    在空军的侵略活动方面，美国第十三航空队从日本投降以后，即以台湾最大的新竹机场为基地。在杜鲁门声明以后，第十三航空队司令胜纳少将于八月四日飞台，并于七日在国民党空军总部内成立“联络”机构，后来又成立了第十三航空队驻台前进指挥所。这个机构的责任，是“就近处理中（国民党匪帮）美空军间之联络及有关联合作战事宜”（国民党中央社八月七日台北电）。在此前后，成批的美国飞机由冲绳等地飞往台湾。国民党台湾电台八月六日广播说：“美喷气飞机六架已于八月四日飞抵台湾。台湾将扩大机场数处，供美空军使用；不过关于有多少机场在扩大，现在还是一个机密。许多工作中的一种是加长跑道，以供喷气式飞机和重轰炸机起落之用。八月六日又有六架喷气式机经过台北上空。”八月间我国向联合国安理会提出控诉后，美机曾一度离台赴冲绳等地，九月份又都返台活动。九月十一日，美远东轰炸机队司令霍尔少将由菲律宾的克拉克基地飞台，“考察”空军的有关事宜。
    美国指挥侵略台湾活动的总机构，是八月四日由麦克阿瑟的副参谋长福克斯少将率领抵台的“麦克阿瑟总部驻台军事联络组”。这个“联络组”是麦克阿瑟于八月一日由台湾返日本后正式任命组织的。该组于八月八日正式在国民党匪帮的台湾防卫总部中开始办公，十六日更名为“美国远东军事驻台考察团”；二十二日，麦克阿瑟又改调美国远东军事统帅部高级官员康克灵任团长。这个“考察团”的业务范围和工作性质与前身的“联络组”相同，实际上是指挥在台湾的蒋匪军及美国侵略军的美国军事使团。它的内部组织分人事、情报、作战及补给四组。全部人员编制为官员五十人，准尉以下士兵七十五人（国民党中央社台北八月十七日电）。九月末，联合国安理会通过我国控美侵略案定期讨论后，十月初，美国官方就装模作样地宣布这个“考察团”由台湾“撤退”。作为团长的康克灵是于十月六日飞到东京去了，但留下的一批人却没有下文。而且据合众社台北十月三日电引权威人士消息说：“召回考察团并不影响杜鲁门令第七舰队巡逻台湾海峡的命令，也不影响和考察团同时建立的美国第十三空军大队联络处的工作。”这就说明了所谓撤离仅不过是美国在我国人民和全世界进步舆论斥责下的一种遮眼法而已。
    此外，美国在台湾的军事侵略机构还有两个，一个是以贾芮特少将为首的、公开名义是武官的军事代表团。这个代表团包括陆海空军校级军官多人，主要任务是控制并训练国民党陆海空军。另外一个是以“中国商业国际公司”的“顾问”和“专家”名义出现的军事顾问，其中包括美国前海军上将柯克、海军陆战队准将费特和空军专家等共四、五十人。他们于五月中旬先后抵台后，立即与国民党统帅部负责人会晤；当福克斯抵台后，这批专家、顾问并参加了美国远东军事驻台考察团的工作。这些事实都证明，所谓商业公司顾问，就是军事顾问的别名。
    这一切表明，美帝国主义已对我国的台湾进行军事侵略，力图把台湾变为它向我国大陆侵略的军事基地。中国人民绝不容许美帝国主义侵略台湾，决心粉碎美国的侵略计划，解放台湾。【新华社】
