　　Looking at Tibetan-Han Relations Through Brick Tea
    Qian Gong
    A history of brick tea is filled with the blood and tears of the Tibetan people.
    Tea is a necessity for the Tibetan people. The history of tea sales in the Kham-Tibet region is a history of exploitation of the Tibetan people by successive feudal dynasties and the Kuomintang bandit gangs. These vicious reactionary rulers, on the one hand, restricted the cultivation of brick tea and monopolized the brick tea market to extract the marrow of the Tibetan people. On the other hand, they exchanged tea for horses to suppress the resistance of the fraternal ethnic groups in the border areas. A glance through the historical records fully exposes the ferocious faces of the feudal dynasties and the Kuomintang reactionaries.
    The New Tang History Food and Goods Record states: “In the ninth year of the Wenzong reign, the people were moved to plant tea trees in the official fields, and their old stocks were burned, causing great resentment throughout the empire.”
    The Comprehensive Strategies for Governance in Ancient and Modern Times states: "During the Xining period of the Song Dynasty, the plan was to buy tea and barter for horses... Horses are beneficial to China, and the barbarians (referring to the Tibetan and Mongolian peoples) only crave tea... Officials were established to open markets in various states of Shu, and the tea tax was increased by 400,000 annually.”
    The tea policy of the Ming Dynasty was even stricter. The Comprehensive Strategies for Governance in Ancient and Modern Times records: “The barbarians (referring to the Tibetan people) love dairy products, and if the Rong people (another term for nomadic peoples) obtain tea, they cannot harm us. If China obtains horses, it will be sufficient for our benefit. This is called using the profits of gathering from the mountains to fill the stables with good steeds, a worthwhile calculation. Moreover, if the Yi people (referring to the Tibetan people) turn their backs on China, they will not obtain tea, and if they do not obtain tea, they will become sick and die. Using this to control them is better than sending tens of thousands of soldiers far away.”
    At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the great butcher Zhao Erfeng established a large-scale border tea company run by officials and merchants, earning a profit of 400,000 yuan in one year. Later, the Kuomintang reactionaries formed the Kang-Tibet Tea Company in Xikang, forcing tea merchants to invest and monopolize the tea industry in Xikang. Tibetan and Han merchants originally traded in silver, with one tael of silver (fifty taels) able to buy thirteen packages of brick tea. Since the Kuomintang reactionary regime issued counterfeit legal currency and declared the so-called nationalization of silver, Tibetan merchants were greatly affected when using silver to buy tea. The Kang-Tibet Tea Company took the opportunity to exchange tea packages for the native products of Tibetan merchants. The company arbitrarily determined tea prices, causing Tibetan merchants to suffer significant losses. Tibetan merchant Bu Chuchu said: The Kang-Tibet Tea Company is an iron shackle that has strangled the economic lifeline of us Tibetans. If the People's Liberation Army had come any later, we Tibetans would have been suffocated and unable to move.
    Kang and Tibet are located on the plateau, with a cold climate. However, according to Tibetan people, places like Luding, Yajiang, Ba'an, and Bomi are suitable for growing tea. The rulers of the Ming and Qing dynasties feared that growing tea in Tibetan areas would take away the sales of Han tea. On the one hand, they strictly prohibited the cultivation of tea in Tibetan-populated areas. On the other hand, they built a blockade line of tea seeds and tea seedlings on the Erlang Mountain near Luding and the Daxiangling Mountain on the road from Rongjing to Kangding, prohibiting the spread of tea trees westward with severe punishments. Therefore, not only could no tea trees be found in suitable tea-growing areas such as Luding and Yajiang, but even if Tibetan people wanted to buy tea fruit to make drinks, they had to ask first whether it had been cooked. The pain inflicted on the Tibetan people by successive feudal dynasties and the Kuomintang bandits is still fresh in the memory of the Tibetan people. No wonder they say that the tea they drink is bitter tea.
    Old trees and empty mountains, tea farmers are driven to desperation.
    Ya'an, Rongjing, and Tianquan in Xikang are brick tea producing areas. The Ming and Qing dynasties implemented the "introduction and bank" system, restricting tea farmers from selling tea only to tea merchants who had introduction tickets. Tea merchants usually lowered prices when buying tea in tea-producing areas, and the income of tea farmers often did not cover the costs incurred. Therefore, tea gardens in this area deteriorated. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, warlords in Sichuan and Kang fought each other, and tea sales plummeted. The number of tea merchants with introduction tickets who came to the tea-producing areas to collect tea decreased day by day. Tea farmers could not sell tea freely and had to watch their tea gardens become desolate. After the establishment of the Kang-Tibet Tea Company, it purchased and sold tea at extremely low prices. Before the company was established, one hundred catties of tea was equivalent to about two hundred catties of rice. Before the liberation of Xikang, one hundred catties of tea could only be exchanged for seventy or eighty catties of rice. In order to increase tea production, tea farmers disregarded the life and death of tea trees and cut off tea branches as thick as fingers when picking tea. Ya'an tea shops and the Kang-Tibet Tea Company used a large scale of twenty-four taels per catty when collecting tea. This large scale was called a "shop scale" and was used exclusively for weighing tea. One hundred catties on the shop scale was equal to one hundred and fifty catties on the old scale. Tea shops purchased at shop scale prices but paid according to the old scale prices. Under the high exploitation of the Kang-Tibet Tea Company, tea farmers were impoverished, and some cut down tea trees for firewood.
    After the layers of exploitation by the Kuomintang reactionary bandits and the multiple squeezes of the Kang-Tibet Tea Company, tea, which the Tibetan people could not live without every day, had become very difficult to obtain before liberation. Native products of Kang and Tibet, such as wool, leather, musk, antlers, anemarrhena, and fritillaria, were therefore difficult to transport and sell. This situation created favorable conditions for the invasion of British and Indian goods. Cunning British merchants exchanged low-priced commodities for the native products of Kang and Tibet and seized part of the tea market. The Kuomintang reactionary bandits and British imperialists attacked from within and without, accelerating the impoverishment of the Tibetan people.
    Correctly implement ethnic policies and improve Han-Tibetan relations.
    The persecution of the Tibetan people in the Kangding area by Han chauvinism for more than a thousand years ended with the liberation of the Kangding area. The Xikang Provincial Trade Company implemented a trade policy that served all ethnic groups in the province. The trade work in the past six months has won the universal support of the Tibetan and Han people. As of the end of August, the tea purchased by the trade company in Ya'an, Tianquan, Rongjing, and other places could produce 400,000 packages of tea (each package weighing sixteen catties - old scale), with an average of one hundred catties of tea equivalent to one hundred and ten catties of rice. This year's summer famine in Ya'an was resolved by the new tea being put on the market, which was exchanged for grain transported from Qionglai and other places, solving the summer famine for tens of thousands of farmers. This year's tea prices are higher than last year's (last year, every hundred catties of tea was equivalent to seventy or eighty catties of rice). In addition, the large-scale purchases by the trade company stimulated tea farmers to pick and produce more tea. The trade company entrusted the Ya'an tea shops to purchase old tea and new tea on its behalf, enabling some of the tea shops that had been suspended to begin operating. As a large number of tea packages were transported to Kangding, supplying the needs of the Tibetan compatriots, the Kangding market was stabilized, sweeping away the phenomenon of supply and demand imbalance and market chaos during the Kuomintang rule. The trade company followed the principle of equal exchange in transactions with Tibetan merchants, exchanging a large number of tea packages for native products from the Tibetan area, providing an outlet for wool, borax, and other products that had not been sold for many years. According to statistics from the Kangding Tax Bureau, the amount of tea transported from Ya'an to the Kangding area was more than 1,900 packages in June, more than 5,400 packages in July, and more than 16,500 packages in August. The amount of fritillaria transported from the Kangding area to the mainland was more than 3,600 catties in June and more than 3,300 catties in July. The amount of musk was 360 in June, more than 1,800 in July, and more than 2,700 in August. In addition, a large amount of rice and daily necessities were also transported. The trade company has played an active role in connecting Kang and Tibetan trade in terms of organizing material exchanges. These efforts, coupled with other aspects of the work, have initially improved Han-Tibetan relations. However, these are only the beginning of improving Han-Tibetan relations. Judging from the perspective of brick tea alone, there is still much work to be done, such as how to improve tea varieties and improve the transportation of brick tea, how to grow tea in Tibetan areas, and so on, all of which need to be further resolved. The ultimate goal of solving these problems is to enable the Tibetan people to drink good and cheap tea. The People's Government will surely be able to achieve this goal. In the past six months, the Tibetan people have confirmed this truth from their own experience.

　　从边茶看藏汉关系
    钳工
    一部边茶史，充满了藏族人民的血泪
    茶是藏族人民生活必需品。一部茶叶运销康藏地区的历史，就是历代封建皇朝和国民党匪帮压榨藏族人民的历史。这些毒辣的反动统治者，一方面限制边茶种植，垄断边茶市场，以吸取藏族人民的膏血。一方面用茶换马，以压制边疆各兄弟民族的反抗。翻一翻史册的记载，十足的暴露出封建皇朝和国民党反动派的狰狞面目。
    新唐书食货志上说：“文宗九年，徙民茶树于官场，焚其旧积，天下大怨。”
    古今治平略上说：“宋熙宁中，经画买茶博马……马、中国所利也，而虏（指藏、蒙诸族）所嗜唯茶……即蜀诸州设官开场，岁增茶课四十万。”
    明朝茶政更严，古今治平略记载：“虏人（指藏族）嗜乳酪，戎得茶不能为我害，中国得马足以为我利，所谓以采山之利，易充厩之良，计之得者也。况夷（指藏族）背中国则不得茶，不得茶则病且死，以是羁縻之，贤于数万师远矣。”
    清末大屠夫赵尔丰设官督商办的大规模边茶公司，一年中盈利四十万元。以后，国民党反动派在西康组成康藏茶叶公司，强迫茶商入股，垄断西康茶业。藏商和汉商交易，原以银两计算，一秤银（五十两）可买砖茶十三包。自国民党反动政权发行伪法币，宣布所谓白银国有后，藏商用银两买茶，受到大的影响。康藏茶叶公司乃乘机用茶包交换藏商的土产。该公司任意决定茶价，康藏商人因此蒙受重大损害。藏商布楚楚说：康藏茶叶公司是铁打的枷锁，扼住了咱们藏人的经济命脉，假若解放军再迟来一些时候，咱们藏人便会窒息得不能动弹了。
    康、藏地处高原，气候寒冷。但据藏民反映，像炉定、雅江、巴安和波密等地，是适于种茶的。明、清两代的统治者，唯恐藏区种茶，会夺去汉茶的销路。他们一方面严格禁止在藏族聚居地区种茶，一方面在炉定附近的二郎山和荣经到康定路上的大相岭建筑一道茶种、茶苗的封锁线，用严刑峻法禁止茶树向西传布。因此，不但炉定、雅江等宜于种茶地区找不到一棵茶树，就是藏民要买茶果来做饮料，也得先问清楚煮熟了没有。历代封建皇朝和国民党匪帮所加诸藏族人民的创痛，藏族人民至今记忆犹新。无怪乎他们说他们所喝的茶是苦茶了。
    树老山空，茶农走向绝境。
    西康雅安、荣经、天全等地是边茶产区，明、清实行引岸制，限制茶农只能将茶卖给据有引票的茶商，茶商到茶区买茶，通常压低价格，茶农售茶所得，往往抵不上所花的成本。因此，这一带的茶园便每况愈下。国民党反动统治时期，川、康军阀混战，茶叶销路锐减。据有引票的茶商到茶区收茶的日益减少，茶农既不能自由销售茶叶，只得眼看着茶园荒芜。康藏茶叶公司成立后，用极低的价钱统购统销茶叶，该公司成立前，一百斤茶约合二百斤米，西康解放前，一百斤茶只能折合七、八十斤米了。茶农为了增加茶叶产量，采茶时便不顾茶树死活，将手指般粗的茶枝也割下来。雅安各茶号和康藏茶叶公司，收茶时所用的秤是二十四两一斤的大秤，这种大秤叫做店秤，专作秤茶之用。店秤一百斤等于老秤一百五十斤。茶号用店秤购进，却按老秤作价付钱。在康藏茶叶公司高度剥削下，茶农山穷水尽，有的将茶树砍掉当做柴烧。
    经过国民党反动匪帮的层层剥削和康藏茶叶公司的多方压榨，藏族人民每天都离不了的茶，在解放前已经很难得到了。康藏的土产，像羊毛、皮革、麝香、鹿茸、知母、贝母等，因而难以运销出去。这种情况，又造成英印货物入侵的有利条件。狡黠的英国商人，用低廉的商品，换走康藏的土产，并夺取一部分茶叶市场。国民党反动匪帮和英帝国主义者内外夹攻，加速了藏族人民的贫穷。
    正确执行民族政策，改善汉藏关系。
    千余年来，康定地区藏族人民所受的大汉族主义的迫害，随着康定地区的解放而结束。西康省贸易公司执行了为全省各族人民服务的贸易政策。半年来的贸易工作，获得藏汉各族人民普遍的拥护。截至八月底止，贸易公司在雅安、天全、荣经等地收购的茶叶，可制茶四十万包（每包重十六斤——老秤），平均一百斤茶合一百一十斤大米。今年雅安夏荒，由于新茶上市，换来自邛莱等地运进的粮食，解决了数万农民的夏荒。今年茶价较去年提高（去年每百斤茶合七、八十斤米），加上贸易公司大量收购，剌激了茶农多采多制。贸易公司委托雅安茶号代购陈茶和新茶，使原已停顿的某些茶号开始活动。由于茶包大量运到康定，供给了藏胞的需要，稳定了康定市场，一扫国民党统治时期供求失调、市场混乱的现象。贸易公司对藏商交易，本着等价交换政策，以大量茶包交换藏区土产，使藏区多年来没有销路的羊毛、硼砂等有了出路，据康定税务局统计：由雅安运到康定地区的茶叶，六月份一千九百余包、七月份五千四百余包，八月份一万六千五百余包。从康定地区运到内地的贝母，六月份三千六百余斤，七月份三千三百余斤。麝香六月份三百六十余个，七月份一千八百余个，八月份二千七百余个，此外，还运到大量的大米和日用品。贸易公司在组织物资交流等方面，起了沟通康藏贸易积极的作用。这些工作加上其他方面的工作，已初步改善了汉藏关系。但是，这些不过是搞好汉藏关系的开端，仅从边茶这一角度来看，要做的工作还多，像怎样改良茶种及改进边茶运输，怎样在藏区种茶等等，都需要继续解决。解决这些问题的终极目标，是使藏族人民能够喝上又好又便宜的茶。人民政府一定能够实现这一目标，半年来，藏族人民已从切身体验中，证实了这一真理。
