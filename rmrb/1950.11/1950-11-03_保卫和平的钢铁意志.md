　　The Steel Will to Defend Peace
　　By our reporter Lin Hong

　　One afternoon, I visited the camp of a certain artillery company of the Beijing garrison. In the square stood glittering American-made anti-aircraft guns captured from the enemy, their muzzles pointing towards the clear blue sky. In a room about two zhang square behind the square, some soldiers were sitting. I saw their heroic expressions and heroic bearing, and heard them vividly recount how they had fought the Japanese invaders in the past, how they had ambushed the enemy in roadside trenches or woods, how they had bravely and cleverly waged tunnel warfare against the Japanese soldiers, and how they had pursued and killed Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops with Japanese and American-made weapons.

　　Soldier Wu Fengcai, a sturdy young man, reviewed the difficult road he had traveled with the expression of a victor. He said excitedly: We must not sit idly by while the United States expands its war of aggression against Korea. Now the flames of war of the American invaders have already reached the doorstep of our motherland. We cannot ignore it even more. Soldier Mu Benqing immediately added: Many Korean revolutionaries once fought alongside us in the Northeast and North China to resist the Japanese invaders. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution is due to the contributions of the Korean comrades. Today, Korea is under American aggression, and we have a responsibility to help them. We must step up our training and prepare to strike at the invaders.

　　He Xipeng is a veteran soldier who joined the army in 1940. There is only a younger brother at home, and there is a lack of labor. The leadership had already approved his demobilization to return home, but he voluntarily requested to return to the army. Why was he once willing to demobilize, but later voluntarily requested to return to the team? He said: At that time, I felt that the revolution had achieved a basic victory, the enemies on the mainland had been eliminated, and the country had embarked on the road of peaceful construction. My family lacked manpower, and I could go back to take care of some housework. However, just as I was about to set off for home, the United States launched a war of aggression against Korea, and the flames of war were approaching the territory of the motherland day by day. I thought, people like me who have been in the army for ten years and have experience in fighting the Japanese and Chiang bandits, can I not stand up to defend the motherland?

　　Many people spoke enthusiastically. Everyone expressed unparalleled anger at the American robbers, and everyone was determined to learn their skills well in order to strike the enemy more accurately. Soldier Sun Baoyi said: Our family has been allocated land, and our parents and sisters have food and drink. During the Japanese occupation, our poor people worked all day and still didn't know where to eat. Today, we have millions of powerful and battle-tested troops, and such good equipment. We have the firm confidence to eliminate the American invaders and defend our fruits of victory. Soldier Du Fuchen was liberated during the Tianjin campaign in 1949, and has become a good soldier of the people in such a university as the Communist People's Liberation Army. He said: In the past, I suffered long-term oppression from Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, and I saw American military vehicles casually run over our people. Now the situation is completely different. If the American imperialists want to come to our country and run rampant again, we will break their heads.

　　These soldiers have fought against the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandit troops. They said: Japanese soldiers are more ferocious than Kuomintang soldiers; American soldiers are more lax than Kuomintang soldiers in the early days of the Liberation War. We started from scratch. We were able to defeat Japanese imperialism and the American-backed Chiang bandit army. Are we still afraid of the American invaders today? Indeed, the American invading army has behaved quite embarrassingly in the war of aggression against Korea. An Agence France-Presse reporter described the ugly behavior of American soldiers, saying: "Even the slightest breeze blowing through the bushes will cause American machine guns to fire."

　　保卫和平的钢铁意志
    本报记者林洪
    在一个下午，记者来到驻京炮兵部队某连的营地。广场上矗立着从敌人手中缴获的闪闪发光的美造高射炮，炮口指向碧绿的晴空。广场后面一间两丈见方的屋子里，坐着一些战士。我看见他们英雄的表情和英雄的气概，听见他们生动地讲述过去怎样和日寇冲杀，怎样埋伏在路旁壕沟里或树林里伏击敌人，怎样英勇机智地和日本兵作地道战，又怎样拿着日造和美造武器，追杀蒋介石匪军。
    战士吴凤财，是一个挺结实的小伙子。他带着胜利者的表情，回顾了曾经走过的艰难的道路，他激动地说：美国扩大侵略朝鲜的战争，我们绝不能坐视。现在美国侵略者的战火，已经烧到了我们祖国的大门口。我们更不能置之不理了。战士木本清立刻接着说：朝鲜许多革命者，曾经和我们在东北、华北并肩作战，反抗日本侵略者。中国人民革命的胜利，朝鲜同志们是有功劳的。今天朝鲜受到美国的侵略，我们有责任援助他们，我们一定要加紧锻炼，准备打击侵略者。
    何锡朋是一九四○年参军的老战士。家里只有一个小弟弟，缺乏劳动力。上级本已批准他复员回家，但他自动要求回到部队。他为什么曾经愿意复员，后来又自动要求回队呢？他说：当时我觉得革命已取得基本胜利，大陆上的敌人已经肃清，国家已走上和平建设的道路，我家里缺乏人力，可以回去料理一下家务。但是，当我正要动身回家的时候，美国发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，战火一天一天的逼近了祖国的领土。我一想，像我这样参军十年的人，打日本打蒋匪都有经验，还能不起来保卫祖国吗？
    发言的人多而热烈。每一个人对美国强盗都表示了无比的愤怒，每一个人都决心学好本领，以便更准确地打击敌人。战士孙宝毅说：我们家里分得了土地，父母姐妹有吃有喝。而在日本占领时期，我们穷人作了一天工，还不知道上那儿吃饭去。今天我们有几百万强大的久经考验的军队，又有这样好的装备，我们有坚强的信心消灭美国侵略者，保卫我们的胜利果实。战士杜福臣是一九四九年天津战役时解放的，在共产党人民解放军这样的大学校中，已经变成一个人民的好战士。他说：过去我受过蒋介石匪帮长期的压迫，看见过美国军车随便轧死我国人民。现在情况已经完全不同了，美帝国主义者想再来我国横行，我们要打破它的脑袋。
    这些战士和日寇及国民党匪军都作过战。他们说：日本兵比国民党军凶；美国兵比解放战争初期的国民党军松。我们赤手空拳起家。能够打垮日本帝国主义和美国支持的蒋匪军，难道今天我们还怕美国侵略者吗？真的，美国侵略军在侵朝战争中，表现得是相当狼狈的。法新社记者描写美国兵的丑态时说：“一阵极细微的风吹动了灌木，都会引起美国机枪的射击。”
