　　The People of Seventeen Counties in Baoding Special District
    Launch Resist America, Aid Korea Campaign
    Join the Army, Pay Grain, Guarantee Consolidated Security
    [Our Newspaper] The people of seventeen counties in Baoding Special District, Hebei Province, have widely launched the campaign to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes and defend the country. The people of the entire district are extremely resentful of the American imperialists' crimes of aggression. Of the 3,945,000 people in the district, more than 2,280,000 have signed the peace declaration. The district-level trade unions, youth federations, women's federations, Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and other people's organizations and relevant departments established the Resist America, Aid Korea Committee on November 6th, and decided to select and print popular propaganda materials and cartoons on current affairs, distributing them to districts, villages, and schools to conduct in-depth propaganda and education, strengthen leadership in current affairs propaganda, and widely carry out the Resist America, Aid Korea movement.
    Since the beginning of November, the broad masses of people in seventeen counties throughout the district have protested and denounced the American imperialist aggression, and expressed their determination to support the Korean People's Army and our volunteer forces aiding Korea with practical actions. The magic lantern shows at the cultural centers of seven counties, including Zhuoxian, Mancheng, Dingxing, and Xushui, are all showing pictures of Resist America, Aid Korea. After watching, the masses said: "The American imperialists are so brutal, we have to fight them!" The blackboards, wall newspapers, and loudspeaker broadcasting machines in these counties are daily publicizing the situation of the Korean people's resistance against the American army and the American imperialists' aggressive atrocities in Korea. In Xushui, the 14 loudspeakers at the markets and temple fairs had more than 20,000 listeners in four days. Workers, peasants, teachers, students, merchants, militiamen, and cadres in various counties held group meetings, forums, and mass meetings to discuss the Korean people's liberation war, write letters to Chairman Mao, and write letters to newspapers, expressing their Resist America, Aid Korea aspirations and actions. Workers in state-owned and private factories in Gaoyang Chengguan unanimously stated: we resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement; we cannot stand idly by while the American imperialists invade Korea. All employees of the Limin Dyeing Factory and the Electric Light Factory shouted in unison during current affairs discussions: "Thoroughly defeat the American aggressors!" Liu Kui, a peasant who was elected as a representative to the provincial model worker conference in Dingxing, said: "We were oppressed by the landlords for so many years, and we only turned over and had a good life after the Communist Party came. Now the United States wants to come and oppress us again, we must strike at it. I want to lead the whole village to do a good job in production, pay public grain well, support the Korean people, and oppose American aggression!" During the autumn grain collection, Nanjie Village in the county completed the village's due public grain of more than 37,000 catties in one and a half days. The masses in Nanlutai Village, Gaoyang, which has suffered from floods for three consecutive years, saved the relief grain given to them by the government by helping each other raise funds for fishing, textile and other sideline production to support the Korean people. Li Mingxian, a military dependent in Changjiazhuang, Wanxian County, wrote to her husband, instructing him to work with peace of mind while away from home and not return until the American imperialist aggression is defeated. She herself is stepping up production at home to support the front.

    Fifty-eight teachers in Xushui County formed a Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda group. The Wanxian Normal School launched the "Three Musts" movement in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement: First, strengthen the study of current affairs and recognize the American imperialists as paper tigers; second, strengthen propaganda to make the American imperialists' crimes of aggression known to every household; and third, each person must save half a liang of rice every day to support the Korean people. More than 300 teachers and students from Zhuoxian Normal School wrote to the Hebei Daily expressing their willingness to join the volunteer army to aid the Korean people.

    The militia in Dingxing, Xushui, Qingyuan and other counties held meetings and discussions. They guaranteed to do a good job in protecting roads and lines to ensure smooth traffic, suppress counter-revolutionary activities, and take the lead in completing various work tasks. Gao Shuzhen, a model militiaman from Liugezhuang, Qingyuan, said: "Not only will I be a model in protecting roads, but I will also be a hero in fighting American soldiers!"

　　保定专区十七个县人民
    展开抗美援朝活动
    参军缴粮保证巩固治安
    【本报讯】河北省保定专区十七个县已广泛展开抗美援朝保家卫国活动。全区人民极端痛恨美帝的侵略罪行。全区三百九十四万五千人中，已有二百二十八万余人在和平宣言上签了名。该专区级工联、青联、妇联、中苏友好协会等人民团体及有关部门，于十一月六日成立了抗美援朝委员会，并决定选印时事通俗宣传材料和漫画，发到区、村、学校，深入宣传教育，并加强时事宣传领导，广泛开展抗美援朝运动。
    进入十一月以来，全区十七个县广大人民群众纷纷对美帝侵略提出抗议、控诉，并表示决以实际行动来支援朝鲜人民军与我援朝志愿部队。涿县、满城、定兴、徐水等七县文教馆的幻灯，都演着抗美援朝的画片，群众看后，表示：“美帝这样暴行，可非打它不行！”这些县的黑板报、墙头报、扩音器广播机，每天都在向人民宣传朝鲜人民抗击美军的情况和美帝在朝鲜侵略暴行。徐水在集市、庙会上的广播机十四个喇叭，四天中有听众二万多人。各县的工人、农民、教师、学生、商民、民兵、干部，都举行着片会、座谈会、群众会，谈论着朝鲜人民的解放战争，上书毛主席、给报社写信，表示自己的抗美援朝的志愿和行动。高阳城关公私营工厂工人一致表示：坚决拥护周外长的声明；对美帝侵略朝鲜，我们不能看着不管。利民染厂和电灯工厂全体职工，在时事讨论时，异口同声地喊起：“彻底打退美国侵略！”定兴被选为出席省劳模代表会的代表翻身农民刘奎说：“我们受地主压迫多少年，共产党来了我们才翻了身，有了好光景。美国又想要来压迫我们，我们一定要打击它。我要带动全村搞好生产，缴好公粮，支援朝鲜人民，反对美国侵略！”在秋征中，该县南街村一天半就完成全村应缴公粮三万七千多斤。高阳三年连受水灾的南路台村群众，以互助集资捕鱼、纺织等副业生产自救，省下政府给他们的救济粮，支援朝鲜人民。完县常家庄军属李鸣贤给丈夫写信，嘱咐他在外安心工作，不打败美帝侵略不回家。自己在家中加紧生产，来支援前方。
    徐水县五十八名教师，组成了抗美援朝宣传小组。完县师范抗美援朝运动中开展了“三要”运动：一要加强学习时事，认清美帝纸老虎；二要加强宣传，使美帝侵略罪行家喻户晓；三要每人每日节约半两米来支援朝鲜人民。涿县师范师生三百多名给河北日报写信表示：自愿参加志愿部队，援助朝鲜人民。
    定兴、徐水、清苑等县民兵，曾分别集会座谈。他们保证：作好护路护线工作，使交通畅通无阻；镇压反革命活动，并带头完成各种工作任务。清苑刘各庄模范民兵高树珍说：“不光当护路模范，我还要当打美国兵的英雄！”
