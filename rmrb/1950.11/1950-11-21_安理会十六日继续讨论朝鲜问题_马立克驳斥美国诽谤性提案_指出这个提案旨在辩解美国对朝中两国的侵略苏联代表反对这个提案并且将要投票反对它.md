Xinhua News Agency, New York, 18th TASS: The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on the afternoon of November 16th to continue discussing the Korean issue. The debate focused on the so-called special report submitted by MacArthur, which insisted that the People's Republic of China was carrying out "aggression" "in Korea."

　　The representative of the Kuomintang clique spoke first, as usual, maliciously slandering the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. The representatives of Ecuador, Cuba, and Norway spoke in defense of the U.S. aggression against Korea, supporting the U.S. proposal. This proposal insisted that "Communist Chinese military forces are participating in combat on the side of the North Koreans" and called on all countries and authorities "not to help or encourage the North Korean authorities, to prevent their nationals, individuals, or units from helping the North Korean army, and to urge any such nationals, individuals, or units that may now be in Korea to withdraw immediately."

　　The Soviet representative, Malik, who spoke next, pointed out that as early as August of this year, the Soviet delegation had submitted a proposal to the Security Council aimed at peacefully resolving the Korean issue, stipulating the cessation of armed intervention in Korea and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea.

　　Under pressure from the U.S. government, the Soviet proposal was rejected. The U.S. government does not support a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and should be held responsible for the consequences of its aggression against Korea.

　　The proposal currently submitted by the United States to the Security Council for consideration aims to justify U.S. aggression against Korea and the People's Republic of China and to expand the scale of U.S. aggression in the Far East.

　　Malik recounted the true history of the Korean War and U.S. aggression in Asia, and further stated: It was clear from the beginning, and later events have fully proven, that the U.S. aggression clique's purpose in disrupting peace was not only to seize South Korea but also to seize North Korea. The intervention of U.S. armed forces in Korea is an open war against the Korean people. Now everyone is very clear that the purpose of this war is to deprive Korea of its national independence and to deprive it of the opportunity to establish a unified and democratic Korean state.

　　At the same time that Truman ordered U.S. troops to attack Korea, he announced that he had ordered the U.S. Navy to prevent an attack on Formosa (Taiwan), which means that the U.S. armed forces occupied this part of Chinese territory. This step by the U.S. government is an open aggression against China, which blatantly violates the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Agreement, which stipulated that Taiwan, as an inseparable part of Chinese territory, should be returned to China. The U.S. government, which has now embarked on the road of openly violating these agreements, after invading Korea with its armed forces, has repeatedly taken aggressive actions against the People's Republic of China, violating China's borders from land, air, and sea. The U.S. intervention forces in Korea, using the name and flag of the United Nations, advanced towards the Yalu River and the Tumen River, directly threatening China's northeastern border.

　　Malik said: As for the infamous special report submitted by MacArthur against the People's Republic of China, the Soviet delegation has previously stated: We do not recognize the so-called United Nations Command in Korea, and we believe that the one-sided and biased report made by MacArthur, who commands the U.S. intervention forces in Korea, is not credible.

　　Therefore, the so-called special report of MacArthur and the statement made by Austin in the Security Council on this issue, as stated by the Government of the People's Republic of China, are "complete distortions of facts, reversals of right and wrong, and pretentious attempts to intimidate people." The U.S. representative, Austin, based on this report of MacArthur, attempted to use the signboard of the United Nations to cover up the further expansion of the war of aggression in Korea and openly invade China. Malik continued, the Chinese people and their government have every reason to lodge accusations against the U.S. government for its hostile provocations and aggression against China.

　　Malik then spoke of the statement made by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China on November 11 of this year regarding the U.S. acts of aggression, and emphasized that this statement fully and convincingly proves that the so-called special report of MacArthur and the statement made by the U.S. representative Austin in the Security Council on this report are distortions of facts and reversals of right and wrong. Therefore, the MacArthur report is one-sided, biased, and not credible, and the U.S. proposal based on this report is of course unacceptable. In addition, the U.S. proposal is based on the illegal resolutions made by some members of the Security Council on June 25 of this year and the illegal resolutions made by the United Nations General Assembly on October 7 of this year, both of which are gross violations of the United Nations Charter and were passed by the U.S.-British bloc in an arbitrary and commanding manner. As is well known, the Soviet delegation has voted against the above-mentioned resolutions both in the Security Council and in the United Nations General Assembly. Therefore, the proposal based on the above-mentioned resolutions is itself unacceptable because it grossly violates the Charter; it is illegal. It is not difficult to see that the purpose of this proposal is to justify and further conceal the U.S. aggression against Korea, aggression against the People's Republic of China, and the expansion of U.S. aggression against the Far East. Due to all of the above, the Soviet delegation opposes this proposal and will vote against it.

　　A secretary from the United Nations Secretariat, at Malik's request, read out a portion of recently distributed documents, including the statement of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China on November 11, which exposed MacArthur's report, pointing out that it was a despicable and filthy reversal of right and wrong, covering up U.S. aggression in Korea and China.

　　安理会十六日继续讨论朝鲜问题 
    马立克驳斥美国诽谤性提案
    指出这个提案旨在辩解美国对朝中两国的侵略
    苏联代表反对这个提案并且将要投票反对它
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社纽约十八日讯：联合国安全理事会在十一月十六日下午举行会议，继续讨论朝鲜问题。辩论集中在麦克阿瑟提出的所谓特别报告上，该报告硬说中国人民政府“在朝鲜”进行“侵略”。
    国民党集团的代表首先发言，他照例对苏联和中华人民共和国进行恶意诽谤。厄瓜多尔、古巴、和挪威代表发言为美国侵略朝鲜辩护，支持美国的提案。这个提案硬说“中共军事部队站在北朝鲜人方面参加作战”，并呼吁所有的国家与当局“不要帮助或鼓励北朝鲜当局，阻止它们的国民、个人或部队帮助北朝鲜军队，并且促使现在可能已在朝鲜的任何这类国民、个人或部队立即撤退。”
    继起发言的苏联代表马立克指出，早在今年八月，苏联代表团就向安理会提出旨在和平解决朝鲜问题的提案，该提案规定停止武装干涉朝鲜，一切外国军队撤出朝鲜。
    在美国政府的压力下，苏联的这个提案遭到否决。美国政府不支持朝鲜问题的和平解决，就应对他们侵略朝鲜的后果负责。
    目前美国提交安理会审议的提案旨在辩解美国对朝鲜和对中华人民共和国的侵略，并在远东扩大美国侵略的规模。
    马立克追述朝鲜战争和美国侵略亚洲的真正史实，并且进一步说：一开始就很清楚，并且后来的事件也充分证明，美利坚合众国的侵略集团破坏和平，目的不仅在于攫夺南朝鲜并且也在于攫夺北朝鲜。美国武装部队对朝鲜的干涉是对朝鲜人民的公开战争。现在每一个人都很清楚，这个战争的目的是要剥夺朝鲜的民族独立，并剥夺建立统一民主的朝鲜国家的机会。
    杜鲁门在命令美国部队进攻朝鲜的同时，宣布他已下令美国海军阻止对于福摩萨（台湾）的进攻，这意味着美国武装部队占领了中国领土的这一部分。美国政府这一步骤乃是对中国的公开侵略，这就粗暴地违反了规定把作为中国领土的不可分割的部分的台湾归还中国的开罗宣言与波茨坦协定。而美国政府是在这些协定上签过字的。现已走上公开破坏这些协定的道路的美国政府，在将自己的武装部队侵入朝鲜以后，又对中华人民共和国一再采取侵略行动，从陆地、空中、海上侵犯中国的边疆。美国在朝鲜的干涉军，利用联合国的名义和旗帜，向鸭绿江和图们江推进，直接威胁中国的东北边境。
    马立克说：至于臭名远扬的麦克阿瑟对中华人民共和国提出的所谓特别报告，苏联代表团前已声明：我们不承认朝鲜的所谓联合国驻朝鲜统一司令部，而且认为统率美国侵朝干涉军的麦克阿瑟所作的片面的别有用心的报告是不能置信的。
    因此，所谓麦克阿瑟的特别报告以及奥斯汀在安理会对这问题的声明，如中华人民共和国政府所声明的那样，乃是彻头彻尾地“歪曲事实，颠倒是非，装腔作势，借以吓人”的。美国代表奥斯汀根据麦克阿瑟的这个报告，企图以联合国的招牌来掩饰进一步扩大在朝鲜的侵略战争而公开进犯中国。马立克继称，中国人民及其政府具有一切理由对美利坚合众国政府向中国进行的敌意挑衅和侵略，提出控诉。
    马立克随后说到本年十一月十一日中华人民共和国外交部发言人就美国的侵略行动所作的声明，并着重指出，这个声明充分令人信服地证明，所谓麦克阿瑟的特别报告以及美国代表奥斯汀在安理会就这个报告所作的声明，乃是歪曲事实，颠倒是非的。因此，麦克阿瑟报告乃是片面的别有用心的而不可置信的，并且根据这个报告而提出的美国提案也当然是不能接受的。此外，美国提案是以本年六月二十五日安理会若干理事国所作的非法决议以及本年十月七日联合国大会所作的非法决议为根据的，而这两个决议都是粗暴地违反了联合国宪章，以专横命令的方式由美英集团通过的。如所周知，苏联代表团不论在安理会上还是在联合国大会上都已投票反对上述决议。因此根据上述一些决议提出的提案的本身也就不能接受，因为它粗暴地破坏了宪章；它是不合法的。不难看出，这个提案的目的是为了要辩解和进一步掩饰美国侵略朝鲜、侵略中华人民共和国，以及扩大美国对远东的侵略。由于上述一切，苏联代表团反对这个提案，并将投票反对它。
    联合国秘书处的一位秘书依照马立克的要求，宣读了最近散发的一部分文件，其中有十一月十一日中华人民共和国中央人民政府的声明，这个声明揭露了麦克阿瑟的报告，指出它是卑鄙龌龊地颠倒是非，在掩饰美国在朝鲜和中国的侵略。
