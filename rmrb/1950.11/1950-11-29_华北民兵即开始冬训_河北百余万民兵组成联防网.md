Xinhua News Agency, 26th: The North China Military Region's winter training for the people's armed forces will begin in early December. The military subjects for this winter training include shooting and grenade throwing, as well as reviewing standard drills. The political education will center on current affairs studies, with the aim of further enhancing the understanding of the American imperialist plot of aggression among the broad masses of the militia and strengthening their determination and confidence in defending their homes and country. The training focus will be slightly different for militia in old and new areas, with the former emphasizing policy and discipline education, and the latter focusing on improving political awareness and establishing a spirit of serving the people. The militia training will be combined with winter production, rural consolidation of Communist Party organizations, winter school and other work. At present, all provinces have begun training people's armed forces cadres and key militia members at the county, district, and village levels, as leading forces and backbones for carrying out large-scale winter training. All provinces will also mobilize demobilized soldiers and veterans in their hometowns to serve as winter training instructors.

Xinhua News Agency, 26th: More than one million people's armed forces in Hebei Province have formed a tight joint defense network throughout the province. The militia, distributed in more than 40,000 villages, have established joint defense between villages, districts, counties, and sub-districts. In the railway line areas, the militia have also established joint road protection. In the Bohai Sea area, the militia have established joint defense teams to protect the coastline. The formation of the province-wide joint defense network has strengthened the defense of the bordering areas of counties and sub-districts.

The militia in Hebei Province, most of whom have received combat training in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, have also undergone preliminary reorganization over the past year. They have made many achievements in maintaining local security, suppressing remaining bandits, and protecting autumn harvests and preventing floods. At present, they are actively strengthening security work and preparing to participate in the large-scale winter training of the North China Region's militia, which will begin in early December, in order to further improve their political awareness and military skills.

　　华北民兵即开始冬训
    河北百余万民兵组成联防网
    【新华社二十六日讯】华北军区人民武装的冬季训练工作将于十二月初开始。此次冬季训练军事课目为射击、投弹，并复习制式动作；政治教育以时事学习为中心，目的要使广大民兵进一步认识美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，加强他们保家卫国的决心与信心。老区民兵和新区民兵的训练重点略有不同，前者着重政策、纪律教育；后者则着重提高政治觉悟，树立为人民服务的精神。民兵训练工作将与冬季生产、农村整顿共产党组织、冬学等工作相结合进行。目前各省均已着手训练县、区、村三级人民武装干部和基干民兵，作为开展大规模冬训工作的领导力量和骨干。各省并将动员复员军人和在乡荣誉军人担任冬训教员。
    【新华社二十六日讯】河北省百余万人民武装已在全省范围内组成了严密的联防网。分布在四万多个村庄中的民兵们，建立了村与村、区与区、县与县、分区与分区之间的联防。在铁路沿线地区的民兵们还建立了护路的联防。在沿渤海地区的民兵们，则建立了保护海岸线的联防队。全省联防网的构成，业已加强了各县、各分区接壤地段的防务。
    河北省的民兵们，大多数曾经受过抗日战争和解放战争的战斗锻炼，一年多以来，又在组织上进行了初步整顿。他们在维持地方治安、清剿残余土匪、护秋防汛等方面有了许多成绩。目前，他们正积极加强治安工作，并准备参加即将在下月初开始的华北区民兵大规模的冬季整训，以更进一步提高政治觉悟和军事技术。
