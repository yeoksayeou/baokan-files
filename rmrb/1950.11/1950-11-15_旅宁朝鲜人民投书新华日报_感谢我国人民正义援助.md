[Reported by Nanjing Xinhua Daily] Korean Residents in Nanjing Write to Xinhua Daily
Thanking Our People for Just Assistance

    [This newspaper's dispatch] According to the Nanjing Xinhua Daily: The news that the volunteer troops organized by our people have joined the just war in Korea has greatly excited and grateful the Korean residents in Nanjing. They wrote a letter to this newspaper to express their wishes, the full text of which is as follows:

    After reading the joint declaration of the Chinese democratic parties and the news in today's Xinhua Daily that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is fighting side by side with our Korean People's Army, we sincerely support and are very grateful to all the Chinese people for their just assistance to us.

    The hateful American imperialists, after the end of the Second World War, disregarding the opposition of their own people and the people of the world, frantically carried out expanding aggressive wars. This hideous face is extremely hateful, and we can no longer tolerate it. Our 30 million excellent compatriots in our motherland, under the beastly atrocities of the American imperialists, have resisted them with firm and tenacious will and the greatest bravery. All the Chinese compatriots also deeply sympathize with and encourage us, and continue to fight side by side with our People's Army on a voluntary basis with practical actions. At the same time, the movement to resist America and aid Korea to defend our homes and defend the country is unfolding vigorously across China. This spirit of courage and righteousness further encourages our loyalty to fight to the end. We are sure that the final victory must belong to our two countries, China and Korea, and the people of the world.

    Our Chinese and Korean brothers must unite like steel, stand at the forefront of defending world peace and opposing aggressive wars, and march towards the bright path of justice, wiping out the mad dog-like American imperialists completely. Long live the unity and friendship between the Chinese and Korean people! Down with the American aggressors!

                            Nanjing Branch of the Korean People's Democratic United Association of Korean Residents in Nanjing

　　旅宁朝鲜人民投书新华日报
　  感谢我国人民正义援助
    【本报讯】据南京新华日报消息：我国人民组成的志愿部队参加朝鲜正义战争的消息传到南京后，朝鲜旅宁侨民感到万分的振奋和感激，他们写信给本报表示他们的心愿，全文如后：
    我们读完了中国各民主党派联合宣言以及今天新华日报上中国人民志愿军与我们朝鲜人民军并肩作战的消息后，热诚地拥护并且非常感谢着全中国人民对我们正义的援助。
    可憎的美帝国主义者们在第二次世界大战结束以后，不顾自己国内和全世界人民的反对，疯狂地进行扩大侵略战争，这一付狞恶嘴脸令人仇恨到了极点，使我们再也无可容忍下去了。我们祖国三千万优秀的同胞在美帝国主义者野兽般的暴行下，已以坚决顽强的意志和最大的英勇来抗击它。全中国的同胞们也深深的同情和鼓励我们，又在志愿的基础上继续以实际行动和我们人民军并肩作战。同时抗美援朝保家卫国的运动正在中国各地澎湃雄壮地展开起来，这种见义勇为的精神更加鼓励着我们斗争到底的忠心。我们确信最后的胜利一定是属于我们中朝两国和全世界人民的。
    我们中朝兄弟要钢铁般的团结起来，站在保卫世界和平，反对侵略战争的最前线，向着光明的正义大道上迈进，把那疯狗般的美帝国主义者消灭得干干净净。中朝两国人民团结友谊万岁！打倒美国侵略者！
