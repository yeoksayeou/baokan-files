　　In Memory of Comrade Ren Bishi
　　Li Da
　　Upon receiving the devastating news of Comrade Ren Bishi's death, I felt as though I had lost my foundation and could not help but burst into tears!

　　From 1933 to 1936, Comrade Bishi was my direct leader. His demeanor and leadership art, fine style, fully armed with Marxism-Leninism as a statesman, gave me extremely profound lessons and impressions.

　　In guiding combat issues, Comrade Bishi completely applied Marxist-Leninist methods and Chairman Mao's strategic thought. Under his leadership, both the Red Sixth Army Group and the Red Second Front Army achieved due results in defending and creating revolutionary base areas. Especially during the two Long Marches, he used outstanding artistic techniques to lead the Red Army in outsmarting the enemy everywhere, without being outsmarted by the enemy. Therefore, the Red Sixth Army Group and the Red Second Front Army wrote glorious and brilliant chapters in the history of the Long March!

　　In general policy guidance, he was always adaptable to the situation and completely correct. Therefore, in the later period of the Xiang-Gan Border Region and throughout the Xiang-E-Chuan-Qian Border Region under his leadership, both the construction of the Red Army and the base areas achieved good results.

　　In terms of leadership style, Comrade Bishi was always patient and unhurried, constantly using his own calm mind and persistent persuasion to enlighten, educate, and support the comrades he led, and he was good at guiding different opinions from all sides onto the correct path.

　　Especially important is that Comrade Bishi was most adept at using his leadership art to handle internal Party struggles. After the Red Second and Fourth Front Armies joined forces, the traitor Zhang Guotao continuously conspired to split the Red Army and sever the direct relationship between the Second Front Army and the Party Central Committee and the Red First Front Army. Comrade Bishi, on the one hand, adhered to principles and educated the comrades, and on the other hand, used his leadership art to conduct an irreconcilable, yet also avoiding rupture to prevent him (Zhang Guotao) from feeling particularly stimulated, sharp struggle, and finally enabled the Red Second Front Army to obtain the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee, and enabled the entire Second Front Army and a part of the Fourth Front Army to closely and harmoniously achieve the goal of joining forces with the First Front Army.

　　In short, everything about Comrade Bishi can serve as an example for the entire Party, the entire army, and especially individuals. In the past, when I was under his direct leadership, I was always learning everything from him. In the future, I will always learn everything from him, in order to "compensate for even one ten-thousandth of the loss caused by the death of Comrade Ren Bishi."

### 悼念任弼时同志

　　悼念任弼时同志
    李达
    我于接获任弼时同志逝世的噩耗之后，顿如失所凭依，不禁为之失声！
    弼时同志由一九三三年起到一九三六年一直是我的直接领导者，他以马列主义所完全武装了的政治家的风度与领导艺术、优良作风，给我的教益和印象是极其深刻的。
    在指导战斗问题上，弼时同志是完全运用着马列主义的方法和毛主席的战略思想的，在他的领导下，无论红六军团与红二方面军，在保卫与创造革命根据地上都获得应有的成果，特别是在两次的长征中，他以杰出的艺术手法，领导红军到处都在玩弄着敌人，而没有被敌人所玩弄。因之红六军团与红二方面军，在长征史上是写下了光荣灿烂的篇幅的！
    在一般的政策指导上，他是始终适应情况，完全正确的，故在他领导的湘赣边区的后期与湘鄂川黔边区的整个时期，无论红军及根据地的建设，都有它良好的成就。
    在领导作风上，弼时同志始终是循循善诱，不急不躁，经常以自身冷静的头脑与不断说服的精神来启发教育和扶持被他领导的同志，并善于将各方不同的分歧意见纳诸正确的道路。
    尤其要紧的，就是弼时同志最善于运用他的领导艺术来处理党内斗争问题。在红二、四两方面军会师后，叛徒张国焘曾不断阴谋分裂红军、打断二方面军与党中央和红一方面军的直接关系，而弼时同志则一方面坚持原则教育着同志，一方面又以他的领导艺术与张国焘进行着不调和地、但又是避免破裂使他（张国焘）不感受特殊刺激的尖锐斗争，终于使红二方面军得到了党中央的直接领导，并使二方面军全部和四方面军的一部亲密和谐地达到与一方面军会合的目的。
    总之，弼时同志的一切都可作为全党全军尤其是个人的榜样。我过去在受他的直接领导时，随时都在学习着他的一切。今后我将永远学习他的一切。以期“补偿任弼时同志逝世所造成的损失”之万一。
