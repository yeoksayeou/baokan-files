Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang: In order to defend their land and their homes, thousands upon thousands of farmers in Northeast China are buying horses and repairing carts, preparing to go to Korea to help the People's Army with transportation work. Farmers in the Liaodong Province area on the right bank of the Yalu River, who have suffered from strafing by American planes, are increasingly enthusiastic about volunteering to go to Korea to participate in the war. Farmers in the counties at the foot of Changbai Mountain alone have automatically organized 4,200 sets of stretchers, ready to cross the river at any time. More than 3,000 farmers in Kuandian and Andong counties have put forward the righteous demand to "go to Korea to help the Korean people fight the American devils and defend our homes." The farmers in Gushanzi District, Andong County, the hometown of worker Li Xiuguo, who died in the strafing by American planes at Andong Airport, are particularly eager for revenge. Farmer Li Hongfan in the district had already packed his stretcher. He said, "I saw through the black heart of the American devils long ago. If they occupy the other side of the Yalu River, we will never have a peaceful life. I will go to Korea to participate in the war this time, and I will never go home until I defeat the American devils."

Han En, a famous labor model in Jilin Province, also recently wrote to the Northeast Daily, saying in his letter: We still clearly remember that in 1947, the United States helped the Kuomintang bandits bomb Xinzhan Street, Jiaohe County, with airplanes. That time, 39 men, women, and children were killed, and blood and flesh flew all over the street. Yang Chengxue's son in our village was also killed. Now the United States continues to send planes to strafe and bomb our cities and villages. Old and new hatreds should be avenged together now. We plan to use the remaining grain this year to buy more livestock. Liu Zuorong and Chi Dianwen both exchanged for good horses and volunteered to help the Korean people fight. I am also determined to take the lead in participating in all logistical work to support the Korean War. At the people's representative meeting in Jianshe Village, Huaide County, farmers Du Jinghui, Yu Xinhai, and others also proposed to send people and horses to support the Korean people's war of liberation.

Farmers in Songjiang Province have spontaneously organized 1,500 sets of stretchers to participate in the war. Sun Zhenxiang and his son Sun Guangming from Donghe Village, Ning'an County, competed to go. The father said that his son was young and inexperienced; the son said that his father was old and inconvenient. In the end, the son convinced his father and set off happily.

The farmers in the suburbs of Shenyang deeply feel that if they do not help the Korean people eliminate the American invading army, their land, houses, grain, carts, and horses will not be guaranteed. The farmers in Xinchengzi District have brought out all the carts and horses they bought this year. They said: These new carts and horses were originally prepared for sideline production this winter, but now the United States is setting fire to our doorstep and preventing us from engaging in production. We will bring out these carts and horses first to help the Korean people and drive away the American devils.

Xinhua News Agency: Under the circumstances that the flames of American aggression seriously threaten our country's security, people from all walks of life in Northeast China have continued to express their firm will to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend the country with practical actions.

Many workers at the No. 1 Machine Tool Plant of the Northeast Machinery Administration in Shenyang have volunteered to go to Korea to assist the People's Army in combat. In addition, more than 20 workers are determined to learn the technology of driving cars, expressing their desire to go to Korea to serve the anti-American war. Labor model Liu Chengfu said, "If the United States occupies Korea, it will occupy the Northeast. In order not to live the life of slaves worse than cattle and horses under the rule of Japanese devils and Kuomintang reactionaries, I am determined to go to Korea to defeat the American soldiers." At the anti-American aggression rally held on the evening of the 3rd at the state-owned Nenjiang Match Factory, advanced producer Cui Guangxuan and 15 workers including Li Jiyun, Wang Lianchun, Ji Jingxian, and Wang Shuqin, as well as many workers from the Nenjiang Textile Factory, expressed their will to resist America and aid Korea.

All the students of the Northeast Military and Political School firmly expressed their desire to go to the forefront of the Korean people's anti-American war to extinguish the flames of American expansion of the war of aggression. Students in various classes and groups of the Heilongjiang Provincial Administrative Cadre School have jointly written letters to the Heilongjiang Daily, expressing their strong will to support the Korean people with practical actions. On November 4 alone, the newspaper received 74 similar letters.

Many medical workers in Shenyang expressed their extreme anger at the wanton massacre of the Korean people by the American beastly army. Some staff members of the China Medical University and its affiliated units are preparing to organize a volunteer medical team to go to Korea to carry out battlefield rescue work. More than 200 people from various hospitals have signed up to join the blood transfusion team. In addition, 97 students and faculty members from the Heilongjiang Health Cadre School also expressed their willingness to participate in the Korean field medical work.

　　东北农民买马修车
    准备赴朝鲜出战勤
    不少工人学生医师表示参战决心
    【本报讯】据新华社沈阳电：为着保卫土地、保卫家乡，东北成千上万农民纷纷买马修车，准备前往朝鲜帮助人民军担任运输工作。曾经遭受美机扫射的鸭绿江右岸辽东省地区农民，志愿赴朝参战情绪日益高昂。仅长白山麓各县的农民，即已自动组织好四千二百付担架，准备随时过江。宽甸和安东两县农民已有三千余人提出了“到朝鲜去帮助朝鲜人民打美国鬼子保卫家乡”的正义要求。在安东机场被美机扫射死亡的工人李秀国的家乡——安东县孤山子区农民，报仇心情异常迫切。该区农民李洪范早就把担架收拾妥当。他说：“我早看透了美国鬼子的黑心眼，他占了鸭绿江那边，我们就永远没安静日子过。我这回去朝鲜参战，不打败美国鬼子，决不回家。”
    吉林省著名劳动模范韩恩最近亦致书东北日报，信中说：我们还清楚记得一九四七年美国帮助国民党匪帮用飞机轰炸蛟河县新站街，那一次男女老少就被炸死三十九名，满街上血肉横飞。我们屯中的杨成学的儿子，也被炸死了。现在美国又不断派飞机扫射、轰炸我们的城市和乡村，旧恨新仇，现在该一起来报了。我们今年计划把剩余的粮食添买牲口。刘作荣和迟殿文两人都换了好马，自愿去帮助朝鲜人民作战。我也下决心带头参加支援朝鲜战争的一切勤务工作。在怀德县建设村人民代表会上，农民杜景惠、于新海等人亦提出出人出马支援朝鲜人民解放战争的要求。
    松江省农民已自发地组织好一千五百付担架参战。宁安县东和村孙振祥、孙广明父子争着要去。父亲说儿子年青没经验；儿子说父亲年老不灵便。结果是儿子说服了父亲，兴高采烈地出发了。
    沈阳市郊的农民们深刻地感到不帮助朝鲜人民消灭美国侵略军队，土地、房屋、粮食、车马全都没有保障。新城子区的农民都把今年新买的车马拿出来。他们说：这些新车新马本来都准备今年冬天搞副业生产的，现在美国把火烧到咱们大门边，不让我们搞生产，我们就把这些车马拿出来，先帮助朝鲜人民，赶走了美国鬼子再说。
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：在美国侵略火焰严重威胁我国安全的情势下，东北各地各界人民日来继续表示以实际行动抗美援朝保家卫国的坚决意志。
    沈阳东北机械管理局第一机器厂的许多工友，都提出志愿赴朝鲜援助人民军作战，另有二十多名工人决心学会驾驶汽车的技术，表示要到朝鲜为抗美战争服务。劳动模范刘成福说：“美国占领了朝鲜就要占领东北，为了不再过像日本鬼子和国民党反动派统治时候那种牛马不如的生活，我坚决要到朝鲜去打垮美国兵。”国营嫩江火柴厂于三日晚举行的反美侵略集会上，先进生产者崔光轩及李基润、王连春、纪敬贤、王淑琴等十五名工友和嫩江纺织厂的许多工友都表示了赴朝抗美的意志。
    东北军政学校全体学员，坚决表示要到朝鲜人民抗美战争的最前线去，熄灭美国扩大侵略战争的火焰。黑龙江省行政干部学校各班、组学员，纷纷联名写信给黑龙江日报，表示他们以实际行动支援朝鲜人民的坚强意志。仅十一月四日一天，该报即收到了同类信件七十四封。
    沈阳的许多医务工作人员，对于美国野兽军队大肆残杀朝鲜人民，表示非常愤怒。中国医科大学及所属单位的若干工作人员，正准备组织志愿医疗队到朝鲜去作战地救护工作，各医院报名参加输血队的已经有二百多人。此外，黑龙江卫生干部学校九十七名学员与教职员，也表示要参加朝鲜野战医疗工作。
