Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 12th: Disregarding the serious protests of the Chinese people, the air force of the American invading forces in Korea continues to intrude into our Northeast airspace and indiscriminately strafe and bomb in Andong, Ji'an, Kuandian, Linjiang, Changbai and other places in Liaodong Province. The number of incidents of the American air force invading our Northeast airspace has not decreased, but has instead increased and become more frequent. From October 28th to November 10th, in the 14 days, the American invading air force in Korea intruded into our airspace 68 times on October 28th, 29th, 31st, November 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th. The number of aircraft dispatched can be counted as 218 (excluding the large number of American air force planes that bombed the Andong Yalu River Bridge at 8:56 on the 9th of this month). In 14 days, a total of 14 Chinese men and women were killed or wounded by American air force bombing and strafing, and 3 head of livestock were killed or wounded. Apart from the bombing of more than 500 civilian houses in Changdianhekou, Kuandian County by 17 or 18 American air force planes at 8:30 on the 9th of this month, which is still under investigation, a total of 62 houses were destroyed in the other incidents.

Of the 14 Chinese compatriots who were killed or wounded by American aircraft bombing and strafing, the names of 11 have been verified. At 9:44 on the 3rd of this month, when three American planes were strafing over Huashudianzi in Ji'an County, Yu Xiuting, an elderly single farmer, was driving an ox cart back to the village. Bullets fired by American planes entered his back and pierced his chest, and his right arm was shot off at the same time. Yu Xiuting died on the spot. At 15:00 on the 6th of this month, when an American plane intruded into Xia Aihejian Village, Jiulian City, Andong, farmer Zhu Changsheng was shot and wounded. The bullet entered from his right shoulder and penetrated the subcutaneous tissue on the left side of the sixth rib of the spine, reaching a depth of six inches, and there was a large amount of subcutaneous extravasation around the wound. At 9:13 on the 8th of this month, an American plane intruded into Changxing Street, Andong City and dropped a bomb, destroying three houses. Resident Lin Junzhu (8 years old) had his right leg broken by bricks and wood, and his left shoulder was injured. Lin Junshan was injured in three places on his face while rescuing his brother. Liu Qu Shi, a neighbor of Lin, and Wang Yuanshan, an 80-year-old man, and his wife Wang Zhang Shi were all concussed. At 2:10 on the 9th of this month, two American planes intruded into Andong Airport and dropped two bombs, destroying one airport dormitory. Jin Xiangjing (18 years old), Jin Zhenai (20 years old), An Cengshun (20 years old), Quan Meishu (26 years old) and others were injured or scratched.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 13th: The American invading air force in Korea is intruding into our airspace more and more frequently, frantically bombing and strafing, killing and wounding our compatriots, thereby depriving the people on the right bank of the Yalu River of their peaceful lives.

On the 3rd of November alone, American planes intruded into our airspace a total of 18 times, twice of which were strafing and bombing in Ji'an and Changbai Counties. Yu Xiuting, a single farmer from Huashudianzi Village, Ji'an County, was shot and killed by bullets from American invaders while driving an ox cart full of jars and basins back to the village, and his blood stained the new cotton clothes he had just put on this year. This old man in his fifties, who had suffered under the oppression of Japanese bandits and landlords for half his life, had been allocated four mu of land in the land reform and was about to begin his happy old age when the bloody claws of the American invaders took his life.

On the afternoon of the same day, the bloody hands of the American bandits committed another atrocity in Badaogou Village, 120 kilometers west of Changbai County. Twenty-two explosive and incendiary bombs were dropped in this remote mountain gully. The village's only primary school, cooperative, and several newly built houses of residents were hit by bombs. Twenty-two households suffered disasters, and 55 houses were destroyed or burned. In addition, 144.1 shi of grain, 13,840 jin of sideline products, 7.8 million yuan in cash, and a lot of farm tools, bedding, and clothing were lost. Except for the 13 people who escaped, the four families of Feng Zhiyi, Zhang Zhaozhong, Bai Chunfu, and Zheng Shicai could not salvage anything. The fruits of the farmers' year of hard work were destroyed by the American devils in a few minutes.

The American aerial bandits' frenzied strafing even endangers pedestrians on every remote mountain path. Bajiazi Village in Changdian District, Kuandian County, which is surrounded by mountains, is inhabited by people who make a living by raising tussah silkworms. On the morning of November 3rd, a group of farmers were returning from picking silkworms on the mountain when the American planes flying there barbarously swooped down and strafed them. On the road near Shengli Village, Buda Yuan District, Kuandian County on the afternoon of the 7th, farmer Jiang Pusheng was driving a cart loaded with cotton picked from the field, and three children were sitting on the cart. Four American planes flew over their heads, one of which strafed, killing the donkey pulling the cart, and the children were stunned by the bombs.

The Chinese people who live in the Changbai Mountains and on the banks of the Yalu River, and who were liberated from the iron hooves of the Japanese bandits only five years ago, are now threatened by another bloody aggressor - the American bandits. However, each bombing and strafing brings not fear and panic, but a thousandfold hatred and anger in their hearts. Gai Shide, a farmer from Huashudianzi, Ji'an County, swore mournfully in front of the tomb of Yu Xiuting, who died: "For the sake of Uncle Yu, for my own sake, I am determined to go to Korea to participate in the Korean people's war of resistance against the United States. If we don't drive away the American devils, the people north of the Yalu River will never have a peaceful day." Zhu Changsheng, a wounded farmer recuperating in Andong Municipal Hospital, firmly stated that after his injury heals, he will immediately go to Korea to join the Chinese People's Volunteers to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea to defend the country, and fight to the death with the American bandits.

　　侵朝美机破坏我国人民和平生活
    两周来又犯我领空六十八次   
    杀伤同胞十四人炸毁大批房屋鸭绿江右岸我国人民愤慨万分
    【新华社沈阳十二日电】美国侵略朝鲜军队的空军不顾中国人民的严重抗议，继续侵入我国东北领空，并在辽东省安东、辑安、宽甸、临江、长白等地滥行扫射和轰炸，美国空军侵袭我东北领空的事件不但没有减少，反而越来越多，层出不穷。从十月二十八日至十一月十日的十四天内，美国侵朝空军先后于十月二十八日、二十九日、三十一日、十一月一日、二日、三日、四日、五日、六日、七日、八日、九日、十日侵入我领空六十八次，先后出动的飞机可统计的有二百一十八架（本月九日八时五十六分轰炸安东鸭绿江桥之美空军大批机群除外）。在十四天之内，被美空军炸射以致死伤的我国男女同胞共十四人，死伤牲口三头。被炸毁房屋除本月九日八时三十分，美国空军飞机十七、八架轰炸我宽甸县长甸河口炸毁民房五百余间一事尚在调查外，其余各次被炸毁房屋共有六十二间。
    被美机炸射以致死伤的我国同胞十四人中，已查明姓名者有十一名。本月三日九时四十四分美机三架在我辑安县桦树甸子上空扫射时，当地独身的年老农民于秀庭正赶着牛车回村，美国飞机射出的子弹从他的背后射入穿过前胸，右臂同时被打掉。于秀庭当即死亡。本月六日十五时，美机一架侵入我安东市九连城区下叆河尖村扫射时，该村农民朱长盛被击伤，弹头自右肩射入脊柱左侧第六肋间之皮下组织，深达六英寸，伤口周围并有多量皮下溢血。本月八日九时十三分，美机一架侵入我安东市长兴街投弹一枚，炸毁房屋三间，居民林钧珠（八岁）被砖木打断右腿，左肩被打伤。林钧山因抢救其兄弟，面部三处受伤。林之邻居刘曲氏、八十老人王元山及其妻王张氏三人头部均被震伤。本月九日二时十分，美机二架侵入我安东机场投弹二枚，毁机场宿舍一间，金相景（十八岁）、金贞爱（二十岁）、安曾顺（二十岁）、权美淑（二十六岁）等四人被炸伤或被擦伤。
    【新华社沈阳十三日电】美国侵朝空军越来越频繁地侵入我国领空，疯狂地轰炸、扫射，杀死杀伤我国同胞，从而剥夺了鸭绿江右岸我国人民的和平生活。
    在十一月三日这一天内，美国飞机侵入我领空共达十八次，其中有两次是在辑安和长白县内进行扫射和轰炸。辑安县桦树甸子村的独身农民于秀庭正赶着满载缸盆的牛车回村时，就遭到美国侵略者子弹的枪杀，鲜血染红了他今年刚穿上的一身新棉衣。这个半生受着日寇和地主压迫的五十几岁的老头，在土地改革中分得了四亩土地，正要开始他幸福的老年生活的时候，美国侵略者血腥的魔爪竟夺去了他的生命。
    就在同一天下午，美国强盗们的血手又在长白县以西一百二十公里的八道沟村制造了另一次暴行。二十二枚爆炸弹和烧夷弹，投掷在这个偏僻的小山沟里。该村唯一的一所小学校、合作社和若干居民新建的房屋被炸弹命中，二十二户居民受到灾害，五十五间房屋被炸毁或烧毁。此外，还损失粮食一百四十四石一斗，副业生产品一万三千八百四十斤，现款七百八十万元和不少的农具、被褥、衣服等等。冯志义、张兆忠、白春福、郑世财等四家农民除了逃出十三口人以外，什么东西也没有抢救出来。农民们一年辛勤劳动的果实，都被美国鬼子在几分钟内给毁灭了。
    美国空中强盗们的疯狂扫射，甚至危害到每一条偏僻的山间小道上的行人。环绕在群山中的宽甸县长甸区八家子村，居民都是饲养柞蚕为生的，十一月三日的早晨，一群农民正从山上摘蚕归来，正在那里飞过的美机竟野蛮地向他们俯冲扫射。七日下午在宽甸县步达远区胜利村附近的路上，农民姜普生正在赶车，车上装着从地里摘回的棉花，还坐着三个小孩。四架美机从他们头上飞过，其中一架就进行了扫射，把拉车的一头驴子打死，孩子们被炸弹震得昏了过去。
    生长在长白山中和鸭绿江畔从日寇铁蹄下解放出来才五年的我国人民，今天又受到另一个血腥侵略者——美寇的威胁。但是，每一次轰炸和扫射，在他们心中引起的不是恐惧和惊慌，而是千百倍的仇恨和愤怒。辑安县桦树甸子农民盖世德在死难者于秀庭墓前悲愤地宣誓说：“为了于大爷，为了我自己，我决心到朝鲜去参加朝鲜人民的抗美战争，不把美国鬼子赶走，我们鸭绿江北的老百姓永远也没有安宁的一天。”正在安东市立医院休养的受伤农民朱长盛，坚决地表示等伤好以后，就立即到朝鲜参加中国人民抗美援朝保家卫国的志愿部队，与美寇决一死战。
