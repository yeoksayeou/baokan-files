　　Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: Recently, progressive people from various countries have sent delegations to visit the Soviet Union. According to incomplete statistics, from August to October, in addition to numerous people's delegations from China, Korea, Vietnam, Mongolia, Hungary, and Albania, there were also nineteen delegations of workers, women, cultural workers, and young students from nine countries, including the United Kingdom, Italy, Finland, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Canada, who visited the Soviet Union. These included the British Electrical Workers and Foundry Workers Delegation, the British Women's Delegation, the Miners' Delegation from the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, the Finnish Women's and Youth Delegation, the Swedish Cultural Workers Delegation, the Canadian Youth Delegation, and the Italian Student Delegation and Cooperative Delegation, among others.

　　People's representatives from various countries visited many Soviet cities and toured factories, farms, and cultural and welfare institutions. Representatives from capitalist countries found the working conditions of Soviet workers to be miraculous. After visiting almost completely mechanized mines, Dutch miners were reminded that coal mines in northern France still bear the scars of war. A Belgian miner who had worked in mines for forty years said that he had never seen such excellent equipment. Many representatives studied the Soviet working people's healthcare system, looked at miners' pay slips, and visited sanatoriums in Crimea and the Caucasus. They have deeply realized why the Soviet people love their socialist motherland and dedicate such tremendous strength to it.

　　After visiting the rebuilt Stalingrad, the British Women's Delegation believed that only under the socialist system could such magnificent construction plans be designed and realized, whereas under the capitalist system, architects have no room for development. The representatives deeply recognized the great strength of the Soviet people from the recovery and development of Ukraine. Representatives from many countries said that they did not know when their countries would be able to recover from the wounds of the last war.

　　The Soviet peace signature campaign, peace rallies, and peace work shifts have strengthened the conviction of peace's inevitable victory among representatives from various countries. A British woman representative said, "During our visit to Stalingrad, everyone we met asked us if we had signed the peace declaration." Many foreign delegations participated in the Second All-Union Congress in Defense of Peace and heard the resounding voices of the Soviet people's representatives defending peace. Swedish worker representatives unanimously believed that the Soviet people are not afraid of war but love peace and their motherland. A Finnish representative said that the huge construction projects visible everywhere are a guarantee of the cause of peace.

　　各国进步人民的代表团纷纷访问苏联各地城市
    访问者都加强了和平必胜的信心
    【新华社二日讯】各国进步人民最近曾纷纷派遣代表团赴苏访问。据不完全统计，自八月至十月，访问苏联的除中国及朝鲜、越南、蒙古、匈牙利和阿尔巴尼亚等人民民主国家的许多人民代表团外，尚有英国、意大利、芬兰、挪威、瑞典、荷兰、比利时、卢森堡及加拿大等九个国家的十九个工人、妇女、文化工作者及青年学生代表团。其中包括英国的电气工人与铸造工人代表团，英国妇女代表团，荷、比、卢三国的矿工代表团，芬兰的妇女及青年代表团，瑞典文化工作者代表团，加拿大青年代表团，以及意大利的学生代表团与合作社代表团等等。
    各国人民代表访问了苏联许多都市，参观了工厂、农场与文化、福利机关。来自资本主义国家的代表们，看到苏联工人的工作条件犹如奇迹一般。在参观了几乎全部机械化的矿坑之后，荷兰矿工想起法国北部的煤场至今还保留着战争的毁灭痕迹。一位在矿坑中工作了四十年的比利时矿工说，他从未看过这样精良的设备。许多代表们研究了苏联劳动人民的保健制度，看了矿工的发薪簿，访问了克里米亚和高加索的疗养区。他们已深切认识到苏联人民为什么热爱着他们的社会主义祖国，并且献出了无比巨大的力量。
    英国妇女代表团在访问了复兴的斯大林格勒后，认为惟有在社会主义制度下，才能设计、实现如此辉煌的建设计划，而在资本主义制度下，建筑家是根本没有发展余地的。代表们从乌克兰的恢复发展中深深认识了苏联人民的伟大力量，许多国家的代表说，他们的国家不知要在什么时候才能恢复上次战争的创伤。
    苏联的和平签名运动，和平集会与和平工作班，都使各国代表加强了和平必胜的信念。英国妇女代表说：“在访问斯大林格勒时，每一个会见我们的人都问我们是否已在和平宣言上签了名。”许多外国代表团参加了第二届全苏拥护和平大会，听到了苏联人民的代表保卫和平的响亮声音。瑞典工人代表一致认为：苏联人民并不害怕战争，而是热爱着和平与他们的祖国。芬兰代表说：到处可见的巨大建设工程，便是和平事业的保障。
