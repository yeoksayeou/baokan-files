　　[Xinhua News Agency, dated 5th] According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow on the 3rd: The Pravda published a dispatch from its Rome correspondent, Chichikina, stating that the Italian people's struggle for peace is growing. The peace program determined by the Executive Bureau of the Permanent Committee of the World Peace Congress in Prague has received a warm response among the Italian people. Local peace committees are now drafting letters of mandate to the 300 Italian delegates attending the Second World Peace Congress based on this program, and are preparing for the Second World Peace Congress by further strengthening the signature campaign for the Peace Declaration. The expansion of aggressive acts by U.S. imperialism in Korea has led more and more Italian people to participate in signing the Peace Declaration. The number of signatures in Rome has reached 750,000, the number of signatures in the Ligurian region accounts for more than 61% of the region's population, Emilia accounts for 59%, and Tuscany accounts for more than 55%. In Sardinia, one of the most backward regions in the country, the number of signatures has also exceeded 25%.
　　The dispatch concluded: The peace proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation at the United Nations General Assembly have been warmly supported by the Italian people, because they know that only the realization of these proposals can save the world and ensure friendly coexistence between countries and nations.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, dated 5th] According to a dispatch from Rome via Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union: The Italian people began holding "Italian-Soviet Friendship Month" on the 5th to enhance cultural, political and economic relations between the two countries, and to consolidate friendship and peace between the two countries. A National Committee for "Italian-Soviet Friendship Month" has been established, and cultural and social figures from all over the country will carry out various activities during the "Italian-Soviet Friendship Month," including holding a celebration meeting for the October Revolution, lectures, discussions, and exhibitions introducing the Soviet Union, as well as Italian-Soviet women's and youth friendship days. The Friendship Month will end on the 26th, when a national conference introducing the Soviet Union's scientific research will be held in Florence.
