　　Long Live the Great Volunteer Army to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea
    Liang Xi
    The United States and Korea are separated by more than 16,000 li, completely unrelated, yet they are coercing the United Nations to bully the small with the big, opening up an unprecedentedly brutal slaughterhouse on the peaceful land of others, while slandering our neighbor, China, whose people's volunteer aid to Korea is a righteous act, as "foreign intervention." This is the consistent trick of all imperialists to reverse black and white, this is the so-called "Voice of America" that cries "stop thief!"
    Since the Opium War, we, the people, are very clear about some tricks that the United States has played, either openly or secretly, on our land. Under the traitorous government of Chiang Kai-shek, we could not speak up and watched it act wildly. Now, we want to solemnly tell American imperialism that 475 million people have become the masters of the country. We have the right to express our own wishes, the determination to defend world peace, and the strength to resist armed aggressors. You, with the eyes of petty bourgeois, question us: "What does China want to gain in Korea?" We answer you with dignity: In the past, the Korean people shed blood together with the Chinese people under the banner of anti-aggression; today, we Chinese people are shedding blood together with the Korean people under the same banner of anti-aggression. This is the national morality of China since its history. If you, who are blinded by greed, are unwilling to understand or simply do not understand, then any rumors and slanders will only make our noble and just actions appear even more radiant!
    Moreover, you, the United States, are invading Korea to gain a springboard for invading our country. Can we still be deceived?
    This is the most practical lesson: the concrete combination of patriotism and internationalism has been manifested in the spirit of thousands of our heroic people who are enthusiastically joining the volunteer army!
    Long live the great and heroic volunteer army heroes!

　　伟大的援朝志愿军万岁
    梁希
    美帝和朝鲜相隔一万六千余里，风马牛不相及，居然挟持着联合国以大欺小，在别人和平的土地上开辟了空前残暴的屠场，却把我们近在咫尺的紧邻中国人民志愿援朝的道义行为诬蔑作“外国干涉”，这就是一切帝国主义者颠倒黑白的惯技，这就是“贼喊捉贼”的所谓“美国之音”。
    自从鸦片战争以来，美帝在我们国土上干的或明或暗的一些把戏，我们人民的心里是一清二楚，在蒋介石卖国政府下面，我们说不上话，蹩着气看它作威作福。现在，我们要正告美帝国主义，四万七千五百万人民已经作了国家的主人翁，我们有权利表达我们自己的愿望，有决心保卫世界的和平，也有力量抵抗武装侵略者。你们以市侩小人的眼光来责问我们：“中国想在朝鲜取得什么”？我们堂堂皇皇地回答你们：过去，朝鲜人民在反侵略的旗帜下和我们中国人民共同流过血；今天，我们中国人民，同样在反侵略的旗帜下和朝鲜人民一道流血，这是我们中国自有历史以来的民族道德。如果利欲心薰的你们不愿理解或者根本不理解，则任何造谣与诬蔑，只有使我们的崇高的正义行动愈益显得光芒万丈！
    何况你，美帝，侵略朝鲜，就是想获得侵略我国的跳板，我们还能受骗吗？
    这是最为现实的一课：把爱国主义与国际主义具体地相结合，已经表现在我们千千万万踊跃参加志愿军伟大的英雄们的气概上！
    伟大而英勇的志愿军英雄们万岁！
