　　Anger from the Deep Mountain Grasslands
    By our reporter Bai Sheng
    Just as representatives of all nationalities of China were joyfully gathering in the capital, the news that the flames of American imperialist aggression were burning closer to our borders day by day enraged the representatives of all brotherly nationalities. On the eve of their departure from Beijing, they expressed their hatred for the American imperialists and their determination to resist aggression and defend the motherland.
    Anniwar Gakulin, a representative of the Kazakh people from Xinjiang, recounted the shameless and despicable sabotage plots carried out by the American imperialists in Xinjiang in the past. It was on September 28th, on the eve of Xinjiang's peaceful liberation last year, that Mark Nahum, the vice-consul of the former US consulate in Dihua, suddenly "disappeared." It was not until mid-December of last year, when three White Russian members of the Xinjiang bandit Usman surrendered to the People's Liberation Army, that Mark Nahum's mysterious whereabouts were revealed. The surrenderers' confessions proved that Mark Nahum and Paxton, the former American consul who left Dihua earlier, were both American spies colluding with bandits within Xinjiang to carry out sabotage activities. Before Xinjiang's liberation, they mainly supported the Kuomintang bandits and special agents, created ethnic hatred among various nationalities, and engaged in anti-Chinese people and anti-Soviet conspiracy activities. Paxton had been to the bandit den of Usman, the habitual bandit, in March and July of last year to give the bandits various instructions. After Xinjiang's peaceful liberation, Mark Nahum sneaked into the Zhenxi mountainous area, which had always been a center for bandits, colluding with the habitual bandit Usman, attempting to instigate the sabotage of Xinjiang's peaceful construction, and spreading various rumors among the people of Xinjiang. When Mark Nahum met with Usman and another bandit leader, Janim Khan, he instructed them that "at present, we should accumulate strength in anticipation of the outbreak of the Third World War." At that time, he gave the bandits twenty-five taels of gold and assured them that the United States would definitely give them assistance in the future. At the same time, he won over three Kazakh youths, claiming that he would send them to the United States for "training" so that "when the Third World War breaks out," he would call them back to Xinjiang to carry out sabotage activities.
    According to what Anniwar Gakulin knew, at that time, Mark Nahum also lured more than 4,000 Kazakh compatriots to run to Zhenxi, forcing them to wander in the cold mountainous areas and desert grasslands, losing their cattle, sheep, and everything else, and suffering endless pain. Many people starved to death along the way because they had nothing to eat. These Kazakh people will never forget this despicable and shameless behavior of the American imperialists.
    Kim Dong-gu, a Korean representative from Yanji County, Jilin Province, residing in Northeast China, is the head of the Yanbian Cultural Troupe in Northeast China. This battlefield literary and art worker, who participated in the Taihang Mountain guerrilla warfare during the Anti-Japanese War, was filled with hatred for the American imperialists. He said: The 1.5 million Korean people living in Northeast China will never sit idly by while the American imperialists invade Korea, nor will they allow the American imperialists to burn the flames of war to the border of Northeast China. When they saw the film of the American imperialist invasion of Korea in Beijing, many Korean cultural troupe members cried at the tragic scenes of the bombed Korean land. Every tear is strength. They vowed to avenge the heroic Korean people who died.
    Li Ru-yun, a Miao representative, also recalled the bestial treatment of the Miao compatriots by the American imperialists when they built an airport near Guiyang in the past. He said that our Miao compatriots shed countless blood and tears and suffered countless hardships there. The Miao compatriots will never forget these things. Today, in order to protect the safety of our Miao mountain villages and the territory of our motherland, our Miao compatriots will organize and never allow American imperialism to invade us again.
    Speaking of the current burning flames of aggression of American imperialism, the representatives of all brotherly nationalities believe that in order to better strike the enemy and aid brotherly Korea, we must strengthen and consolidate the unity of our national family. They said: When Japanese imperialism invaded the people of all ethnic groups in China, we were not able to unite together, and the strength of this national family was scattered. But today, our people of all ethnic groups have begun to unite closely under the banner of Chairman Mao, and this is a powerful demonstration against imperialism. The representatives unanimously stated that they would bring the bloody facts of American imperialism's aggression against the Chinese people back to their own ethnic groups to publicize, so that the people in every ethnic minority area would deeply understand the crimes of American imperialism. Ma Peiqing, a Hui representative, and Huang Xiang, a Tibetan representative, are both representatives attending the Second World Peace Congress. They stated that they would bring the determination of all ethnic minorities in China to defend world peace and their hatred for the American imperialist aggressors to the congress. Huang Xiang, a Tibetan representative, also firmly stated that in order to liberate the Tibetan compatriots under imperialist oppression, imperialism will never be allowed to remain on Chinese soil. Other representatives of all ethnic groups unanimously stated that they would spread the word on their way back, bringing the Chinese people's determination to oppose American imperialist aggression to the remote mountainous areas and grasslands. They will turn their national cultural troupes into powerful propaganda teams against American imperialist aggression, supporting the Korean people, and defending their homes and their motherland.

　　来自深山草原上的愤怒
    本报记者柏生
    正当中华各民族的代表们欢聚在首都的时候，美帝国主义侵略火焰一天天烧近我国边境的消息，震怒了各兄弟民族的代表，他们在离京前夕，表示了对美帝的愤恨和反抗侵略、保卫祖国的决心。
    来自新疆的哈萨克族人民的代表安尼瓦尔加库林，叙述了美帝过去在新疆进行的无耻卑劣的破坏阴谋。那是在去年新疆和平解放的前夕——九月二十八日，前迪化美国领事馆副领事马克南突告“失踪”了。直到去年十二月中旬，新疆惯匪乌斯满部三名白俄向人民解放军投诚后，才揭露了马克南的神秘行踪。投诚者的供述，证明马克南和早期离开迪化的美国前领事派克斯顿，都是勾结新疆境内股匪进行破坏活动的美国间谍。新疆未解放前，他们主要是支持国民党匪特，制造各民族间的仇杀，进行反中国人民和反苏联的阴谋活动。派克斯顿在去年三月间和七月间，都曾到过惯匪乌斯满的匪窟，给匪徒们以各种指示。新疆和平解放后，马克南即潜往一向是土匪聚集中心的镇西山区，勾结惯匪乌斯满，妄图策动破坏新疆的和平建设，并在新疆人民中散布着各种谣言。在马克南会见乌斯满与另一匪首贾尼木汗时，曾指示他们“目前应当积蓄力量，以待第三次世界大战的爆发。”当时他送给匪徒们二十五两黄金，并保证美国将来一定给他们以援助。同时，笼络了三个哈族青年，扬言要送到美国去“训练”，以便“第三次大战爆发时”，叫他们回新疆进行破坏活动。
    据安尼瓦尔加库林所知，当时马克南还诱骗了四千多户哈族同胞跑到镇西，迫使他们流浪在寒冷的山区和沙漠草原上，失掉了自己的牛羊和所有的一切，受尽了痛苦。许多人因为没有东西吃，就饿死在沿路。这些哈族人民对美帝的这种卑鄙无耻的行为，是永远也不能忘记的。
    住在东北境内的吉林省延吉县的朝鲜族代表金东久，是东北延边文工团的团长，这位在抗日战争中就参加了太行山游击战争的战地文艺工作者，充满了对美帝的仇恨心情。他说：居住在东北的一百五十万朝鲜族人民，决不能坐视美帝对朝鲜的侵略，也决不让美帝把战争的火焰燃烧到东北的边境。当他们在北京看到美帝侵略朝鲜战争的影片时，在那被炸的朝鲜土地上的凄惨的镜头里，许多朝鲜族文工团员都哭了。每一个人的眼泪都是力量。他们发誓要为死难的英勇朝鲜人民报仇。
    苗族代表李儒云也想起过去美帝在贵阳附近修建飞机场时，对待苗族同胞的那种野兽般的情形。他说，在那里，我们苗族同胞不知流了多少血和泪，受了多少苦难。这些都是使苗族同胞永远不会忘记的。今天为了保卫我们苗家山寨的安全，保卫我们祖国的疆土，我们的苗族同胞会组织起来，决不让美帝国主义再来侵略我们。
    谈到目前美帝国主义侵略凶焰正在延烧的时候，各兄弟民族的代表认为，为了更好的打击敌人，援助兄弟国家的朝鲜，一定要加强巩固我们民族大家庭的团结。他们说：以前日本帝国主义侵略我们中国各族人民的时候，我们还没有能团结在一起，那时这民族大家庭的力量是分散的。但今天我们各族人民已经开始紧紧的团结在毛主席的旗帜下了，这就是对帝国主义的一个强大的示威。代表们一致表示，要把美帝侵略中国人民的血的事实带到自己民族中去宣传，使每一个少数民族区域的人民都深刻地认识到美帝国主义的罪恶。回族代表马培青、藏族代表黄祥都是出席第二届世界保卫和平大会的代表，他们表示要把中国各少数民族保卫世界和平的决心和对美帝侵略者的仇恨带到大会上去。藏族代表黄祥并坚决表示为要解放在帝国主义压迫下的西藏同胞，决不允许帝国主义留在中国的土地上。其它各族代表都一致表示要沿路宣传回去，把中国人民反对美帝侵略的决心带到边远的山区和草原。他们要把自己的民族文工团变作一支反对美帝侵略支援朝鲜人民和保卫家乡保卫祖国的有力宣传队伍。
