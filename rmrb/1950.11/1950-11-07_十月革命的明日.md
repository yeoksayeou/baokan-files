　　The Tomorrow of the October Revolution
　　Huang Yanpei
    The October Revolution was the first cry of victory for the Soviet people's revolution, and also the first cornerstone of victory for the world's people's revolution. Since the Soviet people's revolution achieved victory, in these thirty-three years, various people's democratic countries have stood up. The People's Republic of China has stood up. One unit after another is eagerly looking to walk this great road. In order to satisfy the survival desires of all mankind, we advocate defending peace; please see that the October Revolution, in its tomorrow, promulgated the Decree on Peace. In order to liberate the exploited laboring peasants, we advocate land reform; please see that the October Revolution, in its tomorrow, promulgated the Decree on Land. Today is still the tomorrow of the October Revolution; the October Revolution has shown us that this is a bright road to the happiness and well-being of all mankind. It simply does not allow a minority of people to obtain unreasonable enjoyment from exploitation and oppression. Intelligent members of the minority, I think they would not regard the unreasonable enjoyment gained from exploitation and oppression as eternal happiness!
    However, the current world still has imperialist countries headed by the United States confronting us; they are still attached to acts of exploitation and oppression; they still want to prevent our people's democratic countries from standing up one by one; they are still dreaming of conquering the world through military aggression; they are still frantically wagging their tails and reading aloud the Tanaka Memorial, an abhorrent tune that makes people want to vomit. That is to say: to conquer the world, first conquer East Asia; to conquer East Asia, first conquer China; to conquer China, first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia; to conquer Manchuria and Mongolia, first conquer Korea. This tells us: to achieve lasting peace, we must use active actions to resist. Resistance is the necessary path for us to strive for survival and strive for peace; it is our sacred mission to defend the motherland and defend all mankind.
    Our people's revolution is just and wins the sympathy of everyone. The imperialists are unjust and lose the sympathy of all mankind. Without a doubt, final victory will belong to the people's revolution.
    Why am I so confident in saying that final victory will belong to the people's revolution? Please see the most obvious precedent, the October Revolution.
    Arise! Arise! This is the tomorrow of the October Revolution.

### 十月革命的明日

　　十月革命的明日
    黄炎培
    十月革命是苏维埃人民革命胜利第一声，也就是全世界人民革命胜利第一块础石。自从苏维埃人民革命取得了胜利，三十三年来，各人民民主国家站起来了。中华人民共和国站起来了。一个一个单位，争先恐后地都望着这条大道走。为了满足全人类生存愿望，我们是主张保卫和平的；请看十月革命的明日，就颁布了和平法令。为了解放被剥削的劳苦农民，我们是主张土地改革的；请看十月革命的明日，就颁布了土地法令。今天还是十月革命的明日，十月革命指示我们了，这是全人类幸福和康乐的一条光明大道。只是不允许少数人再从剥削和压迫上取得不合理的享受。聪明的少数人，我想他们也不会把剥削和压迫得来的不合理的享受永远作为快乐的罢！
    然而，现世界还有以美国为首的帝国主义国家和我们对抗着，它们还在留恋着剥削压迫的行为，它们还想阻止我们人民民主国家一个个站起来，它们还在迷梦着用武力侵略来征服世界，它们还在疯狂地摇头摆尾地朗读着田中奏折最讨厌的人们听了要呕出来的滥调，就是说：要征服世界，先征服东亚，要征服东亚，先征服中国，要征服中国，先征服满蒙，要征服满蒙，先征服朝鲜。这就是告诉我们：要取得持久和平，必须用积极行动来抵抗，抵抗是我们争取生存，争取和平必经的途程，是我们为了保卫祖国，保卫全人类的神圣使命。
    我们人民革命是正义的，是取得每一个人的同情的。帝国主义者们是非正义的，是丧失全人类同情的，毫无疑义的，最后胜利，必归于人民革命。
    我为什么敢于肯定地说：最后胜利必归于人民革命？请看最显明的先例，十月革命。
    起来！起来！这是十月革命的明日。
