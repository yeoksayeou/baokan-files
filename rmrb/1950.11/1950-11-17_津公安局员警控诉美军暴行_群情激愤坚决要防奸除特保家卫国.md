[Report from Tianjin Progressive Daily] More than 40 officers from the Tianjin Public Security Bureau held an anti-U.S. and aid-Korea forum at the Bureau's No. 1 Dihua Road auditorium on the afternoon of the 14th. More than 40 witnesses to U.S. military atrocities gathered together, weaving countless accounts of U.S. troops' crimes against the Chinese people – robbery, shooting, rape, and traffic accidents – into a tearful and bloody condemnation. More than 40 extremely angered comrades gathered together, raising their right arms and vowing to wage an indomitable and desperate struggle to defeat U.S. imperialism, support Korea, and defend our homes and country.

The forum began at 2:00 PM sharp. Zhang Binghuan from the Wanxinzhuang Police Station of the Fourth Branch Bureau spoke first, saying: On August 12, 1946, He Wanshun, a farmhand hired by farmer He Yongtang of Wanxinzhuang Dama Road in Dongjuzi, was working in a millet field when U.S. soldiers shot him dead for no reason. This was "commonplace." Zhou Jianhua, a casual worker for the U.S. motor pool, said that "foreign devils" once ordered him to drive a car to the target range north of the U.S. camp in Dongjuzi and transport six Chinese corpses riddled with bullets, which he then hauled to the South Bridge in Dongjuzi and buried. Zhou Jianhua speculated that they were probably from Tangjiakou or Fuxingzhuang, but it was unknown who they were, and their families might still not know how the deceased disappeared to this day.

Captured U.S. Soldiers Who Committed Crimes Were Falsely Accused of "Murdering U.S. Soldiers"

Guo Xueliang of the Traffic Fourth Detachment said: "On the evening of September 21, 1946, at 9:00 PM, two U.S. soldiers threw a little girl into the river next to the Daguangming Cinema. Two little girls were crying on the riverbank. A white rubber shoe belonging to the little girl who was thrown into the water was left on the riverbank. The U.S. soldier not only refused to tell me his name but also tried to escape. Fearing he would get away, I pushed him into the river to mark him. At this time, Deng Xicheng, the officer on duty at Daguangming, called two U.S. military police jeeps, and they took the two U.S. soldiers, the two little girls, and me to the U.S. military police headquarters. Not only did they not question the perpetrator, but they also charged me with the crime of "murdering a U.S. soldier." They said, "Unless you retrieve the dead girl, you will be charged with murder." That night at 12:00 AM, we went to search for the body. My swimming skills were poor, so I asked a dockworker with the best swimming skills, nicknamed "Sea Monster," to help me. After searching more than 50 meters in the wide riverbed, we finally found the child. One foot was bare, and the other was wearing the white rubber shoe. Her body was still warm. I tried to save her for a long time, but I couldn't revive her. What the U.S. soldier was sentenced to, there was no follow up" He said bitterly, "The child was called Hu Xiaomei. If her body hadn't been found, would I still be alive today?"

Ma Junyang of the Tonglou Police Station of the Sixth Branch Bureau said that on October 16, 1946, his aunt and a neighbor were run over and killed by a U.S. military ten-wheel truck at the British racecourse. When he arrived at the scene, the truck was still on top of the dead bodies. The bodies were swollen all over. He did not demand compensation, much less dare to demand that the perpetrator be punished, only asking the U.S. soldiers to drive the truck away so that the bodies could be collected. He had to plead for a long time.

Although dozens of cases of killings and traffic accidents were mentioned at the meeting, as Sun Guoxing of the Suwei Road Police Station of the Third District said: "The blood debts cannot be fully recounted even in three days and three nights." Tang Junchang said that in Tanggu, he had seen U.S. soldiers forcing an old Chinese man to find them "girls." When the old man refused, he was killed. The U.S. soldier also cut off the old man's left ear and carried it on his waist. The puppet police took him to the U.S. military camp to reason with them. They said, "He was sixty years old and deserved to die. The old man himself is responsible for seven tenths of his own death." In the end, they gave five U.S. dollars and that was the end of it. Someone said, "In the eyes of the U.S. devils, Chinese people are worthless!" Tian Daren of the Eleventh Branch Bureau's office stood up and said: "People are not money. Giving five U.S. dollars after death is not the end of it, giving ten thousand U.S. dollars is not the end of it! Blood debts must be repaid in blood. We must repay blood with blood, life for life!" A burst of enthusiastic applause demonstrated the courage and determination of the armed Chinese people to realize this vow!

Women Raped by American Beasts Ranged from Sixteen to Sixty Years Old

Wu Muzhou of the Technical Office of the Third Division of the Police Law Section said: "Insurance 套 [condoms] and venereal disease medicine are placed at the entrance of the U.S. camp for U.S. soldiers to take at will. What do they take them for? What are all the poles on the street with arrows pointing to the venereal disease treatment station (Prostation) for?..." Wang Jiaqi of the Tenth Detachment of the Traffic Brigade brought materials collected by comrades about U.S. military atrocities. Chang Fusheng said: "Shortly after 'August 15th' [end of WWII], in Sanyizhuang, U.S. soldiers kidnapped a Chinese girl into a jeep and took her to the Astor Hotel, where she was gang-raped by six U.S. soldiers. As a result, the girl was stripped naked and escaped wrapped in a bed sheet. The state of mind of this girl is not hard to imagine." Liu Jiwen said: U.S. soldiers once lured a sixteen-year-old girl into a barracks with candy and raped her. She ran out crying and cursing a quarter of an hour later. Sun Huimin said: When he was at the Zhengzhuangzi Police Station, a woman ran in disheveled, reporting that she had been gang-raped by U.S. soldiers, beaten unconscious, and that the money on her body had been stolen by the U.S. soldiers. Song Baolun, a member of the Traffic Fourth Detachment, said: In September 1945, U.S. soldiers on Guizhou Road dragged a young woman into a sentry box. Song Baolun tricked him by saying "the inspection is here," and released the woman. As a result, the U.S. soldier went to look for him every day. Guo Xueliang said: Two U.S. soldiers once kidnapped Zhu Sha, an actress from the Nanyi Theater Troupe, into a barracks while he was on duty. When he and the U.S. military police found her, they found her with a towel stuffed in her mouth, wrapped in two U.S. military blankets, and placed in an iron box. Zhao Engui of the Foreign Affairs Team of the Tenth Bureau said that unless you went to the hospital for an examination, no one would believe that a sixty-year-old beggar woman was raped by U.S. soldiers on the eve of Christmas. "This time, the U.S. soldiers paid a little money. Because that was shortly after the Shen Chong incident in Beijing, the U.S. soldiers were afraid of provoking even greater anger from the Chinese people!"

We Must Never Allow U.S. Imperialism to Run Rampant Again! U.S. Imperialism Is Not Allowed to Set Foot on Our Soil Again!

In addition, U.S. troops frequently engaged in robbery, fraud, beatings of rickshaw pullers, insults to pedestrians, and pranks. They not only threw eggs and wine bottles at pedestrians, but also threw them at streetlights, chopped down trees with bayonets, and engaged in other destructive and extremely boring actions. The police dared not control them and were often beaten and kicked while performing their duties. When police officers found out, they even said that they were "stirring up trouble."

The People's Police, who had witnessed the various ugly acts of the U.S. military and had personally seen the various atrocities of the U.S. military, deeply realized the essence of U.S. imperialist aggression. They said: "Don't just see the U.S. aid flour; for every benefit it gives to the Chinese people, it kills and harms the Chinese people ten thousand times as much!" They said: "When Chiang Kai-shek invited them to be his foreign fathers, they acted in all sorts of domineering and arrogant ways; if they were to invade the Chinese people again, the lives of the Chinese people would be even more tragic! We cannot allow the U.S. imperialists, who are more vicious than the Japanese invaders, to set foot on Chinese territory again. We must strengthen propaganda, prevent treason and eliminate spies, and fight to the end to defeat U.S. imperialism, support Korea, and defend our homes and country! When the motherland needs us, we will not hesitate to dedicate everything we have!"

　　津公安局员警控诉美军暴行
    群情激愤坚决要防奸除特保家卫国
    【本报讯】据天津进步日报讯：天津公安局员警四十多人于十四日下午在该局迪化道一号礼堂举行抗美援朝座谈会。四十多个美军暴行的见证人坐在一起，用数不清的美军对中国人民的抢劫、枪杀、强奸、车祸等罪行交织成一片有血有泪的控诉。四十多个极端愤怒了的弟兄聚在一起，他们高举着右臂宣誓，要为打败美帝、支援朝鲜、保家卫国而进行不屈不挠的决死斗争。
    座谈会在下午两点整开始。四分局万新庄派出所张炳桓首先发言，他说：一九四六年八月十二日，东局子万新庄大马路农户何永堂家请的散工何万顺正在谷子地里作活，叫美国兵无缘无故的用枪打死了，这是“家常便饭”。美国汽车队散工周建华说，“兵鬼儿”曾叫他把汽车开到东局子美国营盘北边的靶挡地方，运走六具被枪弹打死的中国人的尸体，拉到东局子南大桥埋了。据周建华猜测，他们大概是唐家口或复兴庄的人，可是不知道他们到底是谁，他们的家属也许到今天还不知道死者是怎么失踪的。
    捉住了行凶的美国兵反被诬赖“谋杀美兵”
    交通四分队郭学良说：“一九四六年九月二十一日晚九点，有两个美国兵在大光明电影院旁边把一个小女孩扔到河里去了。两个小女孩在河边上哭，扔到水里的小女孩有一只白胶鞋遗落在河岸上。那美国兵不但不告诉我他的名子，而且还要逃跑。我怕他跑了，一把把他推到河里，给他作个记号。这时大光明值勤岗警邓锡成叫来美国宪兵吉普车两辆，把那两个美国兵、两个小女孩和我都带到美国宪兵司令部去了。他们不但不追问凶犯，反而扣我一个“谋害美兵”的罪名。他们说：“除非你把死了的女孩捞上来，否则即以谋杀论罪。”当夜十二点我们就去摸死尸，我水性不好，请了一位水性最好的码头工人外号叫“海里怪”的帮我，在宽阔水底摸了五十多米才把孩子找到。两只脚一个光着，一个穿着那只白胶鞋，身上还温和呢，我救了半天也没救活。那美国兵是怎么判的也没下文。”他痛恨的说：“孩子叫胡小妹。要是找不着她的尸体，我还能活到今天吗？”
    六分局佟楼派出所马俊扬说：在一九四六年十月十六，他的姑母和一个邻居在英国马场叫美军十轮卡车轧死了。他赶到现场，车还轧在死人身上。两个死人别的都肿了。他不曾要求赔偿，更不敢要求惩凶，只要求美国兵把车子开走以便收尸，还要求了半天。
    虽然会上谈到的杀伤车祸已有几十件，但正如三区宿纬路派出所孙国兴所说：“血债再说三天三夜也说不完。”唐俊昌说，他在塘沽曾见到美国兵逼一个中国老头替他找“姑娘”。老头不允，竟被杀死。美兵还割下老人左耳带在腰间。伪警察把他带到美国兵营理论起来，他们说“活到六十岁该死了，死的责任老头自己要负十分之七。”结果给了五元美金了事。不知谁说：“在美国兵鬼眼里中国人不值钱啊！”十一分局办公室田达仁站起来说：“人不是钱。死了给五块美金不能算完，给一万美金也不能算完！血债要用血来清偿，我们要以血还血，以命抵命！”一阵热烈的鼓掌说明武装的中国人民一定要实现这个誓言的勇气与决心！
    被美国野兽侮辱了的妇女从十六岁到六十岁的都有
    三处警法科技术室吴慕周说：“美国营盘门口摆着保险套和性病药，美国兵可以随便拿，他拿去干什么呢？满街上电线杆子挂箭头，箭头指着性病疗治站（Prostation）是干什么的呢？……”交通大队十分队王嘉祺带来了同志们搜集的一些美军暴行材料。常福生说：“八一五”后不久，在三义庄曾有美国兵把一个中国姑娘架上吉普车，带到利顺德饭店由六个美国兵轮奸了。结果那个姑娘被脱光了衣服，裹着一个被单逃出来。这女孩子的心境是不难想见的。刘济文说：美国兵曾经将一个十六岁的小女孩用糖果诱进兵营，强奸了。她过了一刻钟连哭带骂的跑出来。孙惠民说：他在郑庄子派出所时，一个女人曾披头散发地跑去报告，说她被美军轮奸了之后，被打晕了，而且身上的钱也叫美兵偷走了。交通四分队队员宋宝仑说：一九四五年九月美国兵在贵州路曾经把一个年青妇女拉入岗楼，宋宝仑骗他说“查岗的来了”把那女人放走了，结果每天那美国兵去找他。郭学良说：两个美国兵在他值勤时曾一次把南艺剧团女演员朱莎劫进兵营，当他同着美国宪兵找到她时，发现她嘴里塞着毛巾，裹着两条美国军毯，放在铁箱里。十分局外事组赵恩贵说，假如不到医院去检查，谁也不会相信一个六十岁的乞妇会在圣诞节前夕被美军强奸。“这次，美国兵赔了一点钱。因为那正是北京沈崇事件之后不久，美国兵怕激起中国人民更大的愤怒！”
    决不能让美帝再来横行！不许美帝再踏上我国土！
    此外，美军随便行抢、行骗、殴打三轮车工人，侮辱行人与恶作剧更是屡见不鲜。他们不但用鸡蛋、酒瓶子之类投掷行人，而且还投击路灯泡，用刺刀砍树，作一些破坏而又极其无聊的举动。警察不敢管他们，并且常常为执行任务挨打受踢，警官知道了还说他们“惹事”。
    目睹美军种种丑态，亲眼看见过美军种种暴行的人民警察，深刻的认识到美帝侵略本质。他们说：“别光看见美帝援华面粉，他给中国人一分好处，他杀伤损害中国人就有一万分！”他们说：“蒋介石把他请来当洋爸爸的时候他就百般横行霸道；假若他们再侵略到中国人民头上的时候，中国人的日子更不知要悲惨到什么程度呢！我们不能允许比日寇更凶恶的美帝再踏上中国领土，一定要加强宣传，防奸除特，为打败美帝、支援朝鲜、保家卫国而奋斗到底！当祖国需要我们的时候，不惜献出我们的一切！”
