This is Capitalism

　　Two well-known cancer research institutes in Birmingham, USA, are about to close because the Alabama Cancer Society cannot raise the necessary $50,000 to keep them running. One of these institutes is researching a simple method for diagnosing cancer. For months, American newspapers have been touting that the United States will soon have a rapid cure for cancer. The story of Birmingham, however, shows what the facts really are.

　　A government that has already spent $2 billion on one type of bomb and plans to spend tens of billions of dollars on another cannot even spare $50,000 for cancer research. This is capitalism—capitalism is interested in the Cold War, not in the war to eradicate humanity's most dangerous disease, cancer.

　　According to Washington news: The Korean War has brought soaring prices. $500 million worth of butter, eggs, milk powder, and other non-perishable foods are now rotting in government warehouses and will soon be completely ruined. The U.S. government uses taxpayers' money to buy these things in order to maintain their high prices and increase profits for the plutocrats. On the one hand, millions of Americans cannot afford the milk, eggs, and milk powder they need; on the other hand, the things bought with their money are rotting away. Is this madness? No, this is capitalism.

　　New Orleans news: As prices rise like a runaway horse and people's purchasing power shrinks sharply, meat has become too much of a good thing because too few can afford it. So the U.S. government stockpiles large quantities as "surplus" materials. Although there is a large "surplus" of meat, a so-called sausage company named McCauley and Snyder has been charged with using meat unfit for human consumption. In fact, this is not surprising at all, because this is capitalism, and they are just learning the tricks of the great traditional "free enterprise" to steal from and rob their customers.

　　New York news: The Chicago Symphony Orchestra recently invited Josef Krips, a conservative music conductor from Vienna, to the United States. When he arrived on the American coast, he was refused entry. The U.S. authorities sent him to Ellis Island for detention and then deported him. The reason was that in 1947 he had been sent to the Soviet Union to perform by the extremely conservative Austrian government. American reactionaries often talk about the "Iron Curtain" and say that the Soviet Union "controls" artists. But while Soviet artists such as Ehrenburg are spreading peace around the world, the neurotic Truman government even kicks out and refuses entry to someone whose relationship with communism is limited to waving a baton in a Russian opera house. So this is capitalism.

　　这就是资本主义
    美国伯明罕城的两个知名的癌症研究所即将关门，原因是阿拉巴马州的癌症学会无法募集必要的五万美金来把它们办下去。这两个研究所中间，有一个正在研究诊断癌症的简单方法。好几个月以来，美国的报纸都在大肆吹嘘说美国立即可以得到癌症的迅速医疗法了。伯明罕城的故事却说明事实究竟是怎样的。
    一个已经花了二十亿元在一种炸弹上，并打算在另一种炸弹上花几十亿元的政府，却连凑五万元来作癌症研究之用都吝不解囊，这就是资本主义——资本主义感兴趣的是冷战，而不是扑灭人类最危险的病症，癌症的战争。

    据华盛顿消息：朝鲜战事带来了物价的飞涨。价值五亿美元的牛油、鸡蛋、奶粉和其他不能久贮的食品现在正在政府仓库里腐败，马上就会完全毁掉。美国政府用纳税人的钱买这些东西，是为了保持它们价格的高度，给财阀们增加利润。一方面成百万的美国人却买不起他们需要的牛奶、鸡蛋和奶粉，另一方面用他们的钱买的东西却在那里腐坏。这是神智不清吗？不，这就是资本主义。

    新奥立安消息：由于物价如脱缰之马地上涨，人民购买力急骤萎缩，肉类成了因为买得起的太少而成为太多了的东西。于是美国政府就大量囤积起来，作为“剩余”物资。虽然肉类有大量“剩余”，一家名叫麦考莱和斯奈德的所谓香肠公司却因利用不适于人类食用的肉类而受控诉了。其实这也是毫不足怪的，因为这就是资本主义，他们不过是学习伟大的传统“自由企业”的偷抢雇客的把戏罢了。

    纽约讯：芝加哥交响乐团最近邀请维也纳的保守音乐指挥家约瑟夫·克里普斯到美国去，当他到达美国海岸时，被拒绝登陆。美国当局把他送到埃里斯岛上拘留起来，然后解送回国。理由是在一九四七年他曾经被极保守的奥地利政府派到苏联去表演过。美国反动派常谈到“铁幕”，并且说苏联“控制”艺术家。但在苏联艺术家爱伦堡等在世界各地宣扬和平的时候，神经质的杜鲁门政府连一个和共产主义的关系仅止于在一所俄罗斯的歌剧院里挥了一下棒子的人都要踢他一脚，闭门不纳。原来这就是资本主义。
