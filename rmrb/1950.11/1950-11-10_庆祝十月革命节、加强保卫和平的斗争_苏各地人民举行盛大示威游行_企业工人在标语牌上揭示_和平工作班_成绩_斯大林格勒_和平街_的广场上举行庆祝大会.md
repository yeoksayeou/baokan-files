Xinhua News Agency, dated 9th from Moscow: On the 7th, the Soviet working people celebrated the October Revolution Day with boundless joy. Grand parades and gatherings were held everywhere, from cities to villages, throughout the country. In Novosibirsk, a procession of 200,000 people, like an ocean, carried portraits of Stalin, Mao Zedong, Thorez, and Togliatti, and banners paying tribute to the great Chinese people, the heroic Korean people, and the people of various people's democratic countries, held a demonstration. In Sverdlovsk, the capital of the Urals, 300,000 people held a grand parade. Stakhanovite workers and Stalin Prize winners marched at the head of the procession. Countless bright flags and slogans reading "Defend World Peace" and "We Uphold the Cause of Peace" fully expressed the will and hope of the working people of the Ural industrial region.

Workers from the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Plant and other enterprises in the area brought banners to the parade displaying their new achievements in the "Peace Work Shift." They have overfulfilled their production plans for large quantities of steel and ore seedlings.

The glorious city, the heroic Stalingrad, appeared even more magnificent and solemn on this day. The heroic working people rebuilding Stalingrad held a grand parade along the wide streets and squares, and held a grand celebration meeting in the square formerly on the battlefield, now named "Peace Street."

The parade in Kuibyshev, a city on the Volga River, carried pictures and models illustrating the construction of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station, and charts showing that orders for the power station had been completed ahead of schedule. Enterprises in Kuibyshev have overfulfilled the third quarter plan, and industrial output has increased by 38 percent compared to the same period last year.

Workers in Ivanovo, a textile city in Russia, have gloriously completed the tasks of the "Peace Work Shift" and have overproduced millions of meters of fine fabrics. The October Day parade carried long flags and models showing their production achievements. Their slogan was: "We defend peace with Stakhanovite labor!"
