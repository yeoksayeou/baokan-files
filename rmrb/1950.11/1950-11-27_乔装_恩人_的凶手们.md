　　Murderers Disguised as "Benefactors"
    As is well known, the Wake Island meeting between MacArthur and Truman took place only after that Far Eastern dictator had been repeatedly invited to Washington, and repeatedly refused. Finally, the President himself came out. This matter is understandable, the power of the American military clique is so great today that the President must obey his generals.
    The names of those who attended the meeting speak for themselves. MacArthur, as is well known, has been notorious since the beginning of his career for killing Philippine guerrillas and unemployed Americans. Now he is killing Korean women and children, and he bears the brand of a murderer.
    Other attendees included: Harriman, a representative of the most reactionary group of American monopoly capital and one of the most active warmongers; Chief of Staff Bradley, the advocate of "defensive war"; Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet Radford, and "special envoy" and Wall Street's confidant Yessup.
    This gathering of warmongers can only be called a "meeting of peacemakers" in the ironic sense. But MacArthur, with unparalleled sarcasm, loudly proclaimed that admirals, generals, and bankers alike are truly concerned about the peace and happiness of all peoples! To speak to idiots, MacArthur even claimed that the American plan would arouse "great enthusiasm" in all countries in the Far East!
    The people of the Far East know the American "plans" and "undertakings" very well. They know the heinous atrocities of the American imperialists in Korea. The Korean people will never forgive the American bandits for the blood shed by the crippled women and children, and for the villages and towns that have been reduced to ashes. The people of the Far East will never forget how the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, with the help of American imperialists, destroyed more than ten million people. The Chinese people will never forgive Chiang Kai-shek and his instigators—Truman and MacArthur—for the thousands of Chinese patriots who were executed in the Chongqing death camps. The Chinese people will never forget that American monopolists not only supplied Chiang Kai-shek with billions of dollars, but also, and most intriguingly, with a full set of torture instruments for torturing prisoners.
    The Americans are now hurriedly equipping the French colonialists in Vietnam with tanks and airplanes. The Vietnamese people know very well who is using cannons and shells to destroy their towns and villages. The organ of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, "Labor News," wrote: "The American imperialists are trying to stage the same comedy in Vietnam that has collapsed in China and Greece."
    The peasants of the Philippines will never forgive the American imperialists for the massacre of the residents of Bacalara by the American "peacemakers," nor will they forgive the other massacres since the American "liberation" of the Philippines.
    The bloody and shameful acts of the American colonists have aroused the indignation of progressive humanity around the world. The "concern" of the Truman savages for the people of Asian countries is manifested in the large-scale extermination of peaceful residents, the indiscriminate destruction of towns and villages, and the brutal plunder of the colonial peoples, so their hypocritical statements will deceive no one. The murderers who slaughter women, children, and the elderly will not be able to escape the just judgment of the people of Asian countries. MacArthur's extravagant talk of "enthusiasm" will indeed arouse enthusiasm, but it will be the enthusiasm to fight more resolutely against the despicable imperialist aggression.

### 乔装“恩人”的凶手们

　　乔装“恩人”的凶手们
    麦克阿瑟与杜鲁门的威克岛会议，如所周知，是在那位远东独裁者屡屡次次被邀请到华盛顿去，而又屡屡次次被他拒绝之后，才举行的。最后，总统亲自出马了。这件事情是可以理解的，今天美国军事集团的势力是如此之大，以致总统必须服从他的将军。
    参加会议的人们的名字替他们自己作了说明。麦克阿瑟，如所周知，自其创业之日起，就以杀戮菲律宾游击队和美国失业者而臭名昭著。现在他又杀戮朝鲜妇孺，他身上印有凶手的烙印。
    出席会议的其他人员包括有：美国垄断资本的最反动集团的代表，最活动的战争贩子之一的哈里曼；参谋总长，“防御性战争”的倡议者布莱德雷；太平洋舰队总司令赖德福和“特使”兼华尔街的亲信代理人耶塞普。
    战争贩子们的这一聚会，只有在讽刺的意义上，才能被叫做“和平制造者的会议”。可是麦克阿瑟以无与伦比的刻薄口吻，大声疾呼地宣布说，海军上将们，将军们和银行家们一起，对于各族人民的和平与幸福，真是关怀备至！为了说给白痴们听，麦克阿瑟甚至宣称美国的计划会在远东的一切国家中引起“极大的热忱”！
    远东各国人民对于美国的“计划”和“事业”知道得很透彻。他们知道美国帝国主义者在朝鲜的伤天害理的暴行。朝鲜人民为了肢体残缺的妇孺们所流的血，为了已经化为灰烬的乡村与城镇，绝不饶恕美国强盗们。远东各国人民绝不忘记蒋介石匪帮如何在美国帝国主义者的援助之下，毁灭了一千万以上的人民。中国人民为了在重庆的死亡集中营里被处死的数以千计的中国爱国人士，绝不饶恕蒋介石及其挑唆者——杜鲁门与麦克阿瑟。中国人民绝不忘记，美国垄断资本家们不仅供给蒋介石以数十亿美元，而且最耐人寻思地，还供给他以全套的残害犯人的刑具。
    美国人现在正匆匆忙忙地以坦克与飞机装备越南的法国殖民者们。越南人民知道得很供清楚，应炮弹，以毁灭他们的城镇与乡村的是什么人。越南总工会的机关报《劳动报》写道：“美帝国主义者正图在越南上演已在中国和希腊垮了台的同样的喜剧。”
    菲律宾的农民们，为了美国的“和平制造者们”对巴卡拉罗的居民所进行的大屠杀，绝不饶恕美国帝国主义者，他们也绝不饶恕自美国“解放”菲律宾以来其他各次的大屠杀。
    美国殖民者的血腥而又可耻的行为，引起全世界进步人类的愤慨。杜鲁门生番们对于亚洲各国人民的“关怀”，是表现在大规模灭绝和平居民上，盲目地破坏城镇和乡村上，残酷地掠夺殖民地各族人民上，因而他们的虚伪声明将欺骗不了任何一个人。屠杀妇女、儿童和老人的凶手们将无法逃避亚洲各国人民的正义审判。麦克阿瑟侈谈“热忱”，的确，他的声明将引起热忱，不过那将是更加坚决地为反对卑劣的帝国主义侵略而斗争的热忱。
