American Imperialism Views Overseas Chinese

Here, I will first provide a general overview of the history of overseas Chinese in the Americas: Overseas Chinese in the Americas have a history of over a hundred years, and although there are no precise statistics on the population, reliable estimates place it at around 300,000. The first Chinese to arrive in the Americas came to work as coolies and pioneers. The development of the American West, the mining of gold, and the completion of the Panama Canal all relied on the hard work of overseas Chinese. The "prosperity" of the various countries in the Americas, especially the United States, owes a great deal to the contributions of overseas Chinese. However, the imperialists have completely forgotten the blood, sweat, and labor contributions of the overseas Chinese in construction and are instead subjecting them to all sorts of oppression.

In terms of immigration, various types of immigration regulations are imposed to restrict the entry of overseas Chinese, making it very difficult for overseas Chinese and their families to seek a livelihood abroad. For example, in the past, overseas Chinese going to countries like the United States and Canada had already completed their entry procedures with the American and Canadian "consulates," but upon arrival, they were still detained by the immigration authorities, waiting for interrogation and physical examinations. After being detained for a month or half a year, or even a year, the imperialists would arbitrarily send them back to their homeland, using pretexts such as inconsistent statements or physical problems (the most common being trachoma, skin diseases, or hookworms). Those who were fortunate enough to land were subjected to bullying everywhere. For example, overseas Chinese in the United States do not have the freedom to rent houses. When you go looking for a house, even if you clearly see a "for rent" sign outside the door, the landlord will tell you that the house is already rented and they forgot to remove the sign; Chinese people are also not allowed to enter amusement parks in the western United States.

Hollywood in the United States also produces many films that insult the Chinese. All films about China depict the terrible famines and hunger of the Chinese people, how the American government and churches provide relief to China, and the terrifying infighting among overseas Chinese in America. In the struggles, the Chinese use axes or sharp weapons to kill people, the lives of overseas Chinese in Chinatown are portrayed as dirty, and the Chinese in Chinatown are depicted gambling and smoking opium. They produce such films to maliciously distort the facts, aiming to tell the American people that the Chinese are so barbaric and backward, thereby arousing Americans' contempt and hatred for China and instilling an awareness of aggression against China. In museums or exhibitions throughout the United States, the American imperialists consider the braids and bound feet and small shoes of the Qing Dynasty to be the most worthy of praise. In short, they are merely introducing the remaining backward things and the most primitive and barbaric life of China to the American people. When I walk into museums or exhibitions, I don't even recognize the things displayed inside as belonging to the Chinese people.

In the eyes of the American imperialists, the Chinese are simply not human beings, and other East Asians are not considered human beings either. Therefore, East Asians have never been allowed to apply for American citizenship. They believe that East Asians are only fit to be their slaves. But when World War II broke out, they needed overseas Chinese to fight for them, so they allowed overseas Chinese who were not American citizens to enlist as American nationals.

In order to facilitate the enslavement of the Chinese and the invasion of Chinese sovereignty, the American imperialists hypocritically proposed Sino-American amity, claiming traditional friendship between China and the United States; but in fact, most Americans consider it a disgrace to be friends with the Chinese. No matter how warmly they talk to you indoors, they are unwilling to walk with you. Even overseas Chinese who have married Americans do not have the freedom to walk side by side with their spouses. An overseas Chinese man who married an American woman once humorously told me that he had indeed become a husband after marriage. I asked him what he meant by that, and he said: He and his wife always keep a distance of ten feet when walking outside.

During World War II, many overseas Chinese and Americans fought together in Burma. Even if there were empty seats in the cabs of the large trucks driven by Americans, the Chinese were not allowed to sit there, but were only allowed to sit in the back with the cargo. This situation is similar to the segregation of black people and white people on buses in the United States. I personally experienced this kind of humiliation by the Americans, which is simply outrageous.

Since the liberation of mainland China, American imperialists have oppressed overseas Chinese even more severely. The post office restricts remittances from overseas Chinese by refusing to accept guarantee letters sent to China. The immigration authorities use the excuse of not having diplomatic relations with China to create many difficulties for the current procedures for overseas Chinese to return to their country, restricting overseas Chinese from returning to their country. For example, overseas Chinese applying to return to their country must have a Hong Kong store guarantee and be approved by the Hong Kong government, while in fact, American imperialists collude with British imperialists to make the procedures through Hong Kong particularly strict; there are also many restrictions on overseas Chinese returning to the United States from their homeland. American imperialists also collude with Chiang Kai-shek's special agents to alienate overseas Chinese and crack down on progressive people. Jiang Xingmin, a progressive element among the overseas Chinese in the United States, was recently deported back to his country. The American imperialists initially wanted to send him to Taiwan, but after opposition from various community organizations, they sent him to Hong Kong.

In the past, because the reactionary government ruled, China's industry and commerce declined, and all industries withered. Overseas Chinese had no way out in their homeland, so they went to the United States to work as laborers for the imperialists, to be exploited and abused by them. Therefore, they look down on overseas Chinese with contemptuous eyes. Today, the People's Liberation War has been won, and the people of the whole country, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, are jointly building a new China. The motherland is moving towards independence, democracy, peace, unity, prosperity, and strength. Production is currently being restored and developed, and the industry and commerce of national capital are being helped and cultivated by the state and will be developed reasonably and appropriately; but American imperialism wants to restrict remittances from overseas Chinese and restrict overseas Chinese investment in the motherland to participate in production. The imperialists are afraid of a democratic China and afraid of a prosperous China, because a democratic China has already driven the forces of imperialism out of China and will further prevent imperialist aggression against the Far East; therefore, American imperialism wants to collude with Chiang Kai-shek's special agents to create rumors and deceive overseas Chinese, so that overseas Chinese are estranged from their motherland and have no freedom to love their country.

### 美帝是怎样看待华侨的

　　美帝是怎样看待华侨的
    这里，首先把美洲华侨历史作一个概括的说明：美洲华侨已有一百多年的历史了，人口的多少虽然没有精密的统计数字，但据可靠的估计约有三十万人。华侨最初到美洲，是去当苦工的、当开荒牛的。如美国西部的开垦、金矿的开采和巴拿马运河工程的完成，这些艰巨的工程全靠华侨去做。美洲各国，尤其是美国，他们所以有今天的“繁华”都市，得力华侨不少。然而，帝国主义者对华侨从事劳动和建设的血汗功劳，今天已忘得一干二净了，反而对华侨施以种种压迫。
    在入口方面，施以种种式式的移民条例，限制华侨入口，使华侨及其家属欲往海外谋生者至感困难。例如过去往美国及加拿大等国的华侨，其入境手续本已向美、加“领事馆”办妥，但抵岸时仍被拘留于移民局，等候审查口供及检查身体。拘留了一个月或半年，甚至一年之后，帝国主义者每借口口供不符，或借口身体有毛病（最普遍的如肉沙眼、皮肤病或勾虫），任意将他们遣返祖国，幸而得上岸者，亦到处受人欺凌。例如华侨在美国，就没有租赁房屋的自由，当你去找屋时，明明看见门外挂着“出租”二字，但屋主会回答你说屋已租出了，忘记将牌子除下；在美国西部的游乐场所也不准中国人进去。
    美国好莱坞还制出很多侮辱中国人的影片，凡有关中国的影片，都是描写中国大灾荒和中国人饥饿的情形是怎样的可怜，美国政府和教会怎样救济中国，和描写美国华侨堂斗的情形怎样的恐怖，在斗争中中国人是怎样用斧头或利器杀人，唐人街华侨生活得如何肮脏，中国人在唐人街里如何赌博及吸鸦片等。他们制这样一套一套的电影，恶意地歪曲事实，目的在告诉美国人民中国人是这样野蛮落后，借以引起美国人对中国的轻视与憎恶和灌输对中国的侵略意识。在美国各地的博物院或展览会，美帝认为最值得表扬的是清朝时代的辫子及缠脚带及小足鞋子。总之，不外是把中国残留的落后的东西和原始最野蛮的生活，介绍给美国的老百姓看。当我走进博物院或展览会时，里面陈列的东西，连我也不知道是中国人民的东西。
    在美帝眼里，中国人简直不是人，其他的东亚人也都不当是人看待，所以东亚人一向就不准申请入美国籍，他们认为东亚人只配充他们的奴隶。但当第二次世界大战爆发时，他们需要华侨替他们作战，于是又准非美国籍的华侨当作是美国国民来报名参战。
    美帝为了便利于奴役中国人，便于侵略中国主权，又虚伪地提出中美亲善，说什么中美传统友谊；但其实一般美国人认为和中国人做朋友是耻辱，尽管在室内和你谈得怎样亲热，但他们不愿和你一同走路，就是和美国人结了婚的华侨，他们夫妇间也没有并肩走路的自由。有一个和美国女子结了婚的华侨曾幽默地对我说，他结了婚以后的确变成丈夫了。我问他这话是什么意思，他说：他和他的太太在外面走路时总是距离一丈远。
    第二次世界大战的时候，有许多华侨和美国人同在缅甸作战，凡美国人驾驶的大货车，车头就算有空位，中国人也不能坐，只许坐在后面与货物在一起。这种情形象在美国的黑人和美国人坐车的位置要隔离的一样。这种被美国人侮辱的滋味，我本人也亲尝过，真是岂有此理。
    中国大陆解放后美帝压迫华侨更甚，邮局以不收寄往中国的担保信来限制华侨汇款，移民局借口未与中国建立邦交，对目前华侨返国手续诸多留难，限制华侨返国。如申请返国之华侨必须有香港店铺担保及经香港政府同意，而事实上美帝与英帝勾结对经港手续特别严厉；由祖国返美的华侨也诸多限制。美帝又与蒋匪特务勾结离间华侨，打击进步人士，在美华侨中的进步分子江醒民最近被驱逐返国，美帝初时要遣送他到台湾去，后来经各社团提出反对，才送他到香港。
    侨胞们过去因为在反动政府统治下祖国工商业衰落，百业凋零，他们在祖国没有谋生的出路，所以到美国去给帝国主义者当劳役，给他们剥削，给他们虐待，因此他们以鄙夷的目光来看待华侨。今天人民解放战争胜利了，全国人民在毛主席和共产党的正确领导下共同建设新中国，祖国正朝着独立民主和平统一富强的路上迈进。目前正在恢复和发展生产，民族资本的工商业受到国家的帮助和培养，要合理地适当地发展起来；但美帝要限制侨汇，限制侨资投向祖国参加生产。帝国主义者害怕中国民主，害怕中国富强，因为民主的中国已经把帝国主义的势力赶出中国了，还要进一步阻止帝国主义者对远东的侵略；因此美帝要勾结蒋匪特务制造谣言蒙蔽侨胞，使侨胞对祖国隔膜，使侨胞没有爱国的自由。
