　　In Deep Mourning for Comrade Ren Bishi
    Xiang Ming
    When I heard the unfortunate news of Comrade Ren Bishi's passing, my mind felt as if it had suffered a heavy blow, my heart felt a faint sting, and my eyes filled with tears. It is not the first time for me to feel grief upon hearing such unfortunate news as the death or martyrdom of a revolutionary leader and mentor; however, this time, hearing the news of Comrade Ren Bishi's passing is the most grievous of all. Why does Comrade Bishi's death cause me such particular sorrow?!
    Comrade Ren Bishi was one of the earliest members and organizers of the Chinese Communist Party, a member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, a member of the Politburo, and a secretary of the Central Secretariat. He was a great warrior and outstanding politician of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party, one of the great leaders of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party, and one of Chairman Mao's closest comrades-in-arms and assistants. From the birth to the growth of the Chinese Communist Party, from the development to the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, for thirty years he devoted himself to the great revolutionary cause of the liberation of the Chinese nation, the liberation of the people, and the liberation of the working class. He was a heroic and great warrior in the struggle against national enemies and class enemies; he proved to be an outstanding organizer and politician during the Great Revolution, the Land Revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the People's Liberation War; he demonstrated the noble spirit of a Communist when he was arrested and imprisoned twice and suffered severe torture by imperialists and Kuomintang bandits; he correctly upheld the Party's line and faithfully defended the principles of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle against Chen Duxiu's right-leaning opportunism, against the traitor Zhang Guotao, and against other erroneous lines; he relentlessly hated and attacked the enemy, and infinitely loved and believed in the power of the masses; he believed in victory in the face of revolutionary failures and never became arrogant in revolutionary victory; he was humble and great, simple and wise; he enjoyed high honor among our entire Party, our entire army, and the people of the entire nation!
    Comrade Ren Bishi's death is a major loss to our Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people. Why wouldn't it cause me particular sorrow?!
    When we mourn Comrade Bishi today, grief alone is of no use. More importantly, we must respond to the call of the Party Central Committee: "All Party members, all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, all members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and all patriotic people of China, in order to compensate for the loss caused by Comrade Ren Bishi's death, should learn from Comrade Ren Bishi's example, unite as one, and strive to oppose the aggression of American imperialism, consolidate the national defense of the people's motherland, and continue to develop the people's revolutionary struggle and the cause of people's construction."
    In mourning Comrade Bishi, the comrades of the Shandong Branch Committee of the CPC Central Committee and the 900,000 Party members in the province must learn from Comrade Bishi's example, learn from his spirit of deep love for the motherland, love for the working class, love for the working masses, and love for the people, and his spirit of unremitting struggle and selfless sacrifice in faithfully dedicating himself to the great people's revolutionary cause. We must learn from his high degree of principle in struggling to uphold the Party's line and defend Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, and from his noble qualities of humility, simplicity, and freedom from arrogance and impetuosity. We must ideologically, politically, and organizationally enhance and consolidate the fighting strength of our Shandong Party, stand firmly at our fighting posts, faithfully rely on and unite with the people of the province, and redouble our efforts to complete the glorious tasks assigned by the Party Central Committee and the East China Bureau.
    In mourning Comrade Bishi, the 900,000 Party members, the 500,000 members of the New Democratic Youth League, and the 40 million patriotic people of the province must learn from Comrade Bishi's example, learn from his great spirit of opposing imperialism and feudalism, and his unwavering spirit of struggle for the cause of national liberation and the cause of people's liberation for thirty years. We must complete and conclude the land reform throughout the province, develop agricultural production, develop industrial production, and build a strong economic force; we must actively build the air force and navy, strengthen the army, strengthen the people's armed forces, consolidate coastal defense and national defense, and build a strong defense force; we must resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary activities, exterminate bandits, eliminate secret agents, consolidate social order, protect economic construction, and protect national defense construction; and more importantly at present, we must oppose American imperialism's aggression against our neighboring country, Korea, and oppose American imperialism's aggression against our Taiwan Province, infringing upon our national airspace and territorial waters. American imperialism is the enemy of all Chinese people, American imperialism is the enemy of the people of the world, American imperialism is the general headquarters of international wars of aggression, American imperialism is the general headquarters for the resurrection of the fascist souls of Hitler and Tojo, and American imperialism is the general headquarters for the moral degradation of mankind. We must hate, despise, and scorn American imperialism with a common hatred and a united will. We must defend Chinese peace, defend world peace, and fight to the end to stop the aggressive crimes of American imperialism!
    We will use such practical actions to mourn Comrade Bishi and to compensate for the significant loss caused by Comrade Bishi's death.
    Comrade Bishi: You have bid farewell to us forever! However, your noble and great fighting spirit will forever live in our hearts. Your death makes us feel incomparable grief, and your death also inspires us to redouble our fighting spirit! Your post cannot be replaced by us, but under the call of your immortal spirit, we have more fighters taking up the weapons you left behind, inheriting your unfinished cause, and under the banner of Mao Zedong, we will go from victory to victory! Comrade Bishi: May you rest in peace!

　　痛悼任弼时同志
    向明
    当听到任弼时同志逝世这一不幸的消息时，我的头脑里好像遭受了沉重的打击，我的心坎上感觉到隐隐的剌痛，我的眼眶里含泪欲下。听到革命的领袖和导师逝世或殉难这一类不幸的消息而感觉到悲痛，在我来说绝不是第一次；但是，这一次听到任弼时同志逝世的消息却是最为悲痛的一次。弼时同志的逝世，为什么特别使我悲痛呢？！
    任弼时同志是我们中国共产党最早的党员和组织家，是我们中国共产党的中央委员、中央政治局委员和中央书记处书记，是中国人民和中国共产党的伟大战士和卓越的政治家，是中国人民和中国共产党的伟大领袖、毛主席的最亲密的战友和助手之一，他从中国共产党的诞生到壮大，从中国人民革命的发展到胜利，三十年来如一日地献身于中华民族解放、人民解放和工人阶级解放的伟大革命事业；他在与民族敌人、阶级敌人的斗争中都是英勇而伟大的战士；他在大革命时期、土地革命时期、抗日战争时期、人民解放战争时期都显示出是杰出的组织家和政治家；他在两次被捕入狱遭受到帝国主义和国民党匪徒的严刑拷打时都表现了共产党人的崇高气节；他在反对陈独秀右倾机会主义、反对叛徒张国焘以及反对其他错误路线的斗争中都正确的坚持了党的路线，忠实地维护了马列主义——毛泽东思想的原则；他是无情地憎恨着敌人和打击着敌人，无比地热爱着群众和确信着群众的力量；他在革命失败中确信着胜利，在革命胜利中绝不骄矜；他谦逊且伟大质朴而英明；他在我们的全党、全军以及全国人民中都享受着崇高的荣誉！
    任弼时同志的逝世，是我们中国共产党和中国人民的一个重大的损失，这为什么不特别使我感到悲痛呢？！
    我们在今天悼念弼时同志的时候，光悲痛是无济于事的，更重要的是响应党中央的号召：“全党党员、中国人民解放军全体指战员、中国新民主主义青年团全体团员和全中国的爱国人民，为了补偿任弼时同志逝世所造成的损失，学习任弼时同志的榜样，团结一致，为反对美帝国主义的侵略，巩固人民祖国的国防，继续发展人民革命斗争和人民建设事业而奋斗。”
    悼念弼时同志，我们中共中央山东分局委员会的同志和全省九十万党员，要学习弼时同志的榜样，学习他那种高度热爱祖国、热爱工人阶级、热爱劳动群众、热爱人民大众，忠诚的献身于伟大的人民革命事业而奋斗不懈、忘我牺牲的精神，学习他那种为了坚持党的路线、维护马列主义——毛泽东思想而斗争的高度原则性，学习他那种谦逊质朴，不骄不躁的高尚品质。我们要从思想上、政治上、组织上提高与巩固我们山东党的战斗力量，坚定地站在我们的斗争岗位上，忠诚地依靠和团结着全省人民，加倍努力完成党中央和华东局给予的光荣任务。
    悼念弼时同志，我们全省九十万党员和五十万新民主主义青年团员和全省四千万爱国人民，要学习弼时同志的榜样，学习他那种反对帝国主义、反对封建主义、为民族解放事业、人民解放事业、而三十年如一日始终不渝的伟大斗争精神，我们要完成与结束全省的土地改革，发展农业生产，发展工业生产，建设强大的经济力量；我们要积极建设空军、海军、强化陆军、强化人民武装、巩固海防国防，建设强大的国防力量；我们要坚决镇压反革命活动，剿灭土匪，肃清特务分子，巩固社会治安，保卫经济建设，保卫国防建设；当前更为重要的，我们要反对美帝国主义侵略我们的邻邦朝鲜，反对美帝国主义侵略我国台湾省，侵略我国领空权和领海权。美帝国主义是全中国人民的敌人，美帝国主义是世界人民的敌人，美帝国主义是国际侵略战争的大本营，美帝国主义是希特勒东条法西斯游魂复活的大本营，美帝国主义是人类精神堕落的大本营，我们要同仇敌忾、万众一心的仇视、鄙视、蔑视美帝国主义，我们要保卫中国和平，保卫世界和平，为制止美帝国主义的侵略罪行而奋斗到底！
    我们以这样的实际行动来悼念弼时同志，来补偿弼时同志逝世所造成的重大损失。
    弼时同志：你和我们永别了！但是，你崇高而伟大的战斗精神，却永远活在我们的心里，你的死，使我们感到无比悲痛，你的死，也使我们更加倍的激励了斗志！你的岗位，我们是不能代替的，但是在你不朽的精神感召下，我们有更多的斗士拿起你遗留下的武器，继承着你未竟的事业，在毛泽东的旗帜下，将要从胜利走向胜利！弼时同志：愿你安息吧！
