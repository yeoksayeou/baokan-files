Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch: Hong Kong - Contrary to the erroneous stance of the Indian government attempting to interfere in our country's liberation of Tibet, Pakistani newspapers *The Dawn* and *The Times of Karachi* commented on the People's Liberation Army's advance into Tibet on October 28th and 29th, acknowledging that this was entirely a matter of China's internal affairs. The official *The Dawn* stated in its editorial on the 28th: "Pakistan has no direct interest in the matter of Tibet. Tibet has always been legally Chinese territory. ... There seems to be no tendency in Karachi (the capital of Pakistan) to consider China's military actions in Tibet as exceeding the scope of internal affairs." The newspaper criticized the Indian government's error, saying: "Nehru's attempt to influence the Chinese government's policy towards Tibet has not been successful. Mr. Nehru's confidence in exhorting important Asian countries to follow his 'moral leadership' has evidently been weakened by the developments in Tibet."

*The Times of Karachi* editorial on the 29th criticized the Indian government's behavior of interfering in China's internal affairs, saying: "Reports regarding China's advance into Tibet seem to have alarmed the Indian government and a portion of its press. ... Foreign imperialist forces (referring to foreign imperialist forces in China) have been driven out, and internal unity has been restored, with the exception of Tibet and Taiwan. The Beijing government decided to remove these two exceptions as quickly as possible and declared its determination immediately after the founding of the nation. Therefore, the surprise expressed by New Delhi is truly perplexing." The newspaper stated, "When China was weak and unable to take care of itself, Britain was able to turn Tibet into a semi-dependent state. Although Britain's influence in Lhasa has been significant since its unwarranted invasion in 1904 (referring to Britain's armed invasion of Tibet in 1904), China's sovereignty over Tibet has never been denied. The Nehru government seems to feel that it has inherited the responsibilities of British imperialism in Tibet. Otherwise, its protests to Beijing are meaningless, and the implied threat that India will withdraw its support for China in the United Nations if China meddles in Tibet is nothing more than base blackmail. If Nehru represents imperialist interests and intends to interfere in China's internal affairs, he will lose his existing minor reputation as an independent political leader. If the Indian government believes that its sole motive is humanitarian, hoping to avoid bloodshed, then why didn't they strive earlier for the peaceful return of Tibet to China?" The newspaper said, "The entire fact of the British plot to control Tibet has been confirmed since the failure of Chiang Kai-shek. Perhaps others do not know, but the British trick is very obvious. Since they cannot control any part of today's China, they want to create an 'independent' Tibet, just as the United States attempts to separate Taiwan and regard it as a separate entity. Regardless of this attempt, China must restore and maintain territorial integrity, if only because the local government in a place with a feudal autocratic rule with almost no popular support is resisting the Beijing government."

### 巴基斯坦报纸论我进军西藏  斥尼赫鲁企图干涉中国内政

　　巴基斯坦报纸论我进军西藏
    斥尼赫鲁企图干涉中国内政
    【新华社八日讯】香港讯：与印度政府企图干涉我国解放西藏的错误立场相反，巴基斯坦报纸《黎明报》及《时报》于十月二十八、二十九日评论人民解放军进军西藏时，承认这完全是中国内政问题。官方的《黎明报》二十八日的社评说：“巴基斯坦对西藏事没有直接兴趣，西藏在法律上一直是中国领土。……在喀喇蚩（巴首都），似无任何趋向，认为中国在西藏的军事行动是超过内政范围的。”该报指摘印度政府的错误说：“尼赫鲁企图影响中国政府对西藏政策没有成功。对于尼氏劝勉亚洲重要国家跟随尼氏‘道德领导’之信心，显已被西藏的发展而削弱。”
    《时报》二十九日的社评指摘印度政府干涉中国内政的行为说：“关于中国进军西藏之报道，似乎使印度官方和一部分报纸惊惶失措。……外国帝国主义势力（按指在中国的外国帝国主义势力）已被赶走，内部统一已被恢复，只有西藏和台湾例外。北京政府决定尽可能快地除去这两个例外，并于建国之后即宣布下定决心，因此新德里表示的惊讶，实令人不解。”该报说：“在中国力量薄弱自顾不暇的时候，英国得以使西藏变成半附属国，虽然自一九○四年无端进军（指一九○四年英国对西藏的武装侵略）以来，英国在拉萨之势力甚大，但中国在西藏之主权从未被否认过。尼赫鲁政府似乎觉得它继承了英帝国主义在西藏的责任，否则它对北京的抗议是毫无意义的，而且暗示着的如果中国染指西藏，印度即将撤回在联合国对中国的支持的威胁，只不过是卑贱的敲诈而已。如果尼赫鲁代表帝国主义利益，意图干涉中国内政，他将失去他现有的独立政治领袖的微名。如果印度政府认为他们唯一动机是人道主义的、避免流血的希望，那他们为什么不早为西藏和平归还中国而努力呢？”该报说：“英国控制西藏阴谋的整个事实，自蒋介石失败后，曾被肯定。可能别人不知道，但英国的把戏是很明显的。自从他们不能控制今天的中国任何一部分时起，他们便想造出一个‘独立的’西藏，正如美国企图分开台湾而视为一个单独整体一样。不管这个企图，仅就几无人民拥护之封建专制统治的地方政权反抗北京政府而言，中国也一定要恢复和维持领土完整的。”
