Xinhua News Agency, 3rd -- Ignoring the repeated serious warnings of the Chinese people, the American aggressors not only continue to direct American troops and their accomplices to frantically advance towards the Sino-Korean border, but they also publicly fabricate excuses to attempt to invade our national border. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on October 31st, Almond, the "Commander of the Tenth Corps and Commander of the Northeast War Zone of Korea" of the American aggressors in Korea, said recklessly: "My goal is to take all the troops under my command to the border." Almond also fabricated an excuse to invade our national border, saying: "The enemy is there, and we will put our forces there... If they reinforce from across the border, if they come in from there (the area where the enemy enters Korea), we will fight them there." On the same day, "a senior official" of MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo supplemented the excuse made by Almond, shamelessly attempting to deny that the Yalu River is the border between China and Korea. The senior official pointed out: "The United Nations forces have advanced very far north, and 'we are now encountering' the 'border situation' where Chinese and Korean people live together on both sides of the Yalu River." The official said: "We have heard that perhaps more than one million Koreans live north of the Yalu River, and there is also much reason to believe that tens of thousands of Chinese live south of the Yalu River." "Historically speaking, the Yalu River is not an obstacle that separates the two countries completely" (International News Service Tokyo, October 31st). Church, the commander of the 24th Division of the American invading forces, who is advancing towards the mouth of the Yalu River on the west coast of Korea, has become like a mad beast, ordering the division on October 31st to "advance to the Chinese border overnight." Church arrogantly clamored: "It would be really strange if we don't reach the Yalu River tomorrow." The American puppet Syngman Rhee has conspired to seize the hydroelectric power station on the Yalu River, telling a United Press reporter on October 31st: "The Chinese have no right to get a kilowatt-hour of electricity."

　　美侵略者公然制造借口
    企图进犯我国国境
    竟想否认鸭绿江是中朝的国界
    李承晚阴谋夺取鸭绿江水电站
    【新华社三日讯】不顾中国人民迭次的严重警告，美国侵略者不仅仍在继续指挥美军及其帮凶，疯狂地向中、朝边境进犯，而且竟公然制造企图侵犯我国国境的借口。据美联社东京十月三十一日电，美国侵略朝鲜的“第十兵团司令兼朝鲜东北战区总指挥”阿尔梦德放肆地说：“我的目的就是带着在我指挥下的全部部队到边境去。”阿尔梦德并制造侵犯我国国境的借口说：“敌人在那里，我们就要把我们的兵力投在那里。……如果他们自边境那边增援，他们从那里（敌人进入朝鲜的地区）进来，我们就在那里打他们”。同日，东京的麦克阿瑟总部的“一个高级官员”替阿尔梦德所作的借口作了补充，竟无耻地企图否定鸭绿江是中朝两国的国界。该高级官员指出：“联合国军队已向北推进了很远，‘我们现在碰到’鸭绿江两岸中朝人民混居的‘边界情况’。该官员说：‘我们听说也许有一百多万朝鲜人住在鸭绿江以北，而且也有许多理由相信有成千成万的中国人住在鸭绿江以南’。在历史上说来，鸭绿江并不是把两国截然分开的一道障碍”（国际新闻社东京十月三十一日电）。而在朝鲜西海岸向鸭绿江口进犯的美侵略军第二十四师师长邱奇更变得像发了疯的野兽一样，在十月三十一日命令该师“连夜向中国边境推进”，邱奇狂妄地叫嚣：“如果我们明天到不了鸭绿江，那才真是怪事。”美国傀儡李承晚则已阴谋夺取鸭绿江上的水电站，他从十月三十一日对合众社记者表示：“中国人没有权利可以得到一个千瓦时的电力”。
