　　[Our Newspaper] News: Following the publication of the "Joint Declaration of the Democratic Parties," a surge of enthusiasm for resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding homes, and defending the country has swept through Beijing's students. Students from Peking University, Tsinghua University, Yenching University, Agricultural University, Jiaotong University Beijing Railway College, Huimin College, Fourth Middle School, and other schools have been actively requesting to volunteer for the army. On the evening of the 4th, while Tsinghua students were watching the Korean film "Appeal to All Conscientious People" in the auditorium, they heard the broadcast of the "Joint Declaration of the Democratic Parties" and immediately walked out of the auditorium to parade and demonstrate on campus. The senior students of the Department of Chemical Engineering discussed the declaration until late into the night. Some students were so excited that they could not sleep all night. Four students voluntarily donated 8 million yuan and a bicycle to buy tanks for the Korean People's Army. Wang Hongzheng, a fourth-year overseas Chinese student from the Department of Aeronautics who had lived in Korea for 60 years, had been unable to concentrate on his studies for the past two weeks. After seeing the declaration, he immediately volunteered to join the army. On the evening of the 5th, at a gathering of over 2,400 teachers, students, and staff to resist America, aid Korea, safeguard homes, and defend the country, 23 students from the Chemical Engineering Training Program, who had long participated in the revolutionary struggle in the old liberated areas, unanimously expressed their desire to join the volunteer army. The meeting also passed resolutions to: establish a school-wide action organization to resist America, aid Korea, safeguard homes, and defend the country; conduct propaganda in the countryside; and send a telegram to the All-China Students' Federation requesting them to call on students nationwide to intensify their study of current affairs and take other positive actions. As of the evening of the 5th, 40 teachers and students, including Dong Shoushen, from Tsinghua had decided to join the army.
　　Lei Chongli, Ge Anlin, Shao Ruzhen and 52 other students from Yenching University jointly wrote a "Letter to Mom," saying, "The democratic parties have agreed to send volunteer soldiers," "Mom! The American imperialists are going crazy, I'm not coming home," "You think of Northeast China as the center of Chinese industry," "It is already under artillery fire," "As a just and loyal Chinese youth, I absolutely cannot let it be invaded," "We will emulate China's Dan Niang, the second Li Lantinger." Huang Yongxi and four other students wrote a letter of determination, "In order to defend the motherland, we are willing to dedicate everything we have and use all our abilities." Forty-three students from the Department of Mechanical Engineering signed and issued a declaration, "We resolutely demand to join the volunteer army to resist America and aid Korea, and call on students to join this great and righteous army." Thirty students from Guangdong signed and called on everyone to stand up and fight for the lasting peace of the Chinese people and the world.
　　The vast majority of students in the Korean Language Department of the Department of Eastern Languages at Peking University volunteered to participate in the Korean War to resist America. Some students in the Department of Chemistry were looking everywhere for places to register as volunteers to join the army.
　　Many students at Jiaotong University Beijing Railway College waited to listen to the broadcast of the joint declaration of the democratic parties on the evening of the 4th. Although the 5th was Sunday, in less than four hours, 635 teachers, staff, and students from the entire school, including Lu Naizhen, signed their names in support of the declarations of the democratic parties and expressed their willingness to dedicate their greatest efforts to fight for resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding homes, and defending the country.
　　On the morning of the 5th, more than 200 students from the "Youth Company" composed of senior high school students who were practicing guerrilla warfare at Wanshou Temple in the western suburbs, were even more excited after seeing the joint declaration of the democratic parties. In the evening, 109 people registered with the student union to join the volunteer army.
