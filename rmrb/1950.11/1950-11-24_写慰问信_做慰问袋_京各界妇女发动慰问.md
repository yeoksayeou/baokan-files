Writing Comfort Letters, Making Comfort Bags
Beijing Women from All Walks of Life Launch Comfort Campaign

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Women from all walks of life in Beijing have recently launched a campaign to write comfort letters and make comfort bags. This is one of the actions taken by Beijing women to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend their country. In addition to working twelve hours a day to step up production, the female workers in the clothing factories have also written many comfort letters. Jin Xiuru, a seventeen-year-old apprentice, told the comrades of the volunteer army in her letter that they are treating the factory as a battlefield, proposing competitions and guaranteeing to complete production tasks ahead of schedule. She also said, "We hope you kill a few more American invaders for us, and we guarantee to support you." Model worker Wang Wanying also wrote, "We will definitely guarantee to provide our brothers with new clothes on time and resolutely serve the frontline soldiers." Jin Xiuling wrote, "The hearts of hundreds of millions of people in the rear are all concerned about you." They have now written dozens of such passionate and encouraging letters. Making comfort bags has also become a work during rest time. They all said, "Sending a comfort bag expresses our hearts." Liu Junying, Lu Shuqin, and Luo Junzhi from the tenth team jointly made a bag of white satin with red satin edges, pasting "Patriotic Hero" on one side and "Victory Forward" on the other, and also sewed on a red five-pointed star. Military dependents also participated in this movement. The military dependents in the first district said, "Our children have all joined the revolution, and we should do a good job in the rear and take the lead." Old Mrs. Bai is seventy years old this year, and she said, "Although my eyes are not clear, I also want to write a letter to comfort our volunteer army."

Housewives' groups have also written comfort letters and made comfort bags one after another. The Nancheng group of the Beijing Women's Federation is preparing to collect three hundred comfort bags and four hundred comfort letters, and is using this to challenge the sisters of other groups. The Beicheng and Xicheng groups have also responded and taken action. The Tsinghua Housewives Association has received 166 comfort bags, some of which are filled with new woolen vests; they also help comrades without families to make comfort bags. The Peking University Women's Association has also received more than 100 comfort bags; everyone said, "The volunteer army is helping to fight the American devils in Korea, and we should support their heroic actions and express our respect with these small things." The Young Women's Christian Association has mobilized one thousand members to make comfort items. The North China Women's Temperance Association is preparing to make five hundred comfort bags and has now received more than one hundred. Member Xia Shuzhen mobilized forty-five people alone, twenty-five of which she made herself. Her family is not well-off, and she said to her children, "Let's eat less vegetables and also comfort the soldiers!" Member Chen Tongyun made thirty comfort bags alone.

At last week's staff meeting of the Beijing Women's Federation, comrades actively proposed that they would write comfort letters and make comfort bags. Many comrades, in addition to volunteering to send their own scarves, gloves, coats, etc. to the Korean People's Army, also wanted to mobilize their parents, relatives, and friends to make them. Comrade Chu Yiyuan from the embroidery factory also donated one tael of gold left to her and her younger brother by her grandfather. In her comfort letter to the volunteers, Comrade Yi Yu wrote, "I am very envious of you who are already fighting the American devils side by side with the Korean brothers on the battlefield." She hoped to go as soon as possible and also said, "I will concentrate on sticking to my work until the last minute before leaving." (Zhu Ying)

　　写慰问信·做慰问袋
    京各界妇女发动慰问
    【本报讯】北京市各界妇女最近发动写慰问信和做慰问袋运动。这是北京妇女界抗美援朝保家卫国的行动之一。被服厂的女工们除了每日用十二小时工作来加紧生产外，还写了很多慰问信。十七岁的小副工金秀茹在信上告诉志愿部队同志们，她们正在以工厂当战场，提出竞赛保证提早完成生产任务。并且说：“希望你们多替我们打死几个美国侵略者，我们保证支援你们。”学习模范王万英也写着“我们一定坚决保证按时叫哥哥们换上新衣服，坚决为前线战士服务。”金秀玲写着：“后方千千万万人民的每一颗心，都在关怀着你们。”现在她们已经写了数十封这样充满热情和鼓励的信了。做慰问袋也成为休息时间的工作。她们都说：“送个慰问袋，表表咱们的心。”十班的刘俊英、陆淑琴，罗君志三人合做了一个白缎子镶红缎边的袋子，一边剪贴上“爱国英雄”，另一边剪贴上“胜利前进”，还缝上红五星。军属们也参加了这一运动。一区的军属们说：“咱们的儿女都参加了革命，咱们在后方应该搞好工作，起带头作用。”白老太太今年七十岁了，她说：“我的眼睛虽然看不清，我也要写封信慰问慰问咱们的志愿部队。”
    家庭妇女团体也纷纷写慰问信，做慰问袋。北京妇女联谊会南城小组准备收集三百个慰问袋，四百封慰问信，并以此向其他各组姐妹挑战，北城和西城小组也应战行动起来了。清华家庭妇女会已收到一六六个慰问袋，有的袋中装上了新的毛背心；她们还帮助没有家的同志作慰问袋。北大妇女会也已经收到一百多个慰问袋；大家都说：“志愿部队到朝鲜帮助打美国鬼子，我们应当支援他们的英勇行为，用这一点东西表示咱们的敬意。”女青年会已发动一千会员作慰劳品。华北妇女节制会准备作五百个慰问袋，现已收到一百多个，会员夏淑珍一人就发动四十五个，其中二十五个是她自己作的。她的家境并不宽裕，她对孩子们说：“咱们少吃点菜，也应该慰劳战士们！”会员陈同筠一人就作了三十个慰问袋。
    北京市妇联的同志们在上星期的工作人员大会上，纷纷提出自己要写慰问信做慰问袋。有很多同志除志愿把自己的围巾、手套、大衣等送给朝鲜人民军外，还要发动自己的父母、亲友来作。挑补花工厂的褚异元同志把祖父留给她和弟弟的一两黄金也捐献出来了。以予同志给志愿军的慰问信上写着：“我很羡慕你们已经在战场上和朝鲜兄弟并肩打美国鬼子了。”她盼望自己能早点去，并且还说：“在走前一分钟都要安心坚持工作。”  （朱颖）
