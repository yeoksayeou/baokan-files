　　Thirty-Three Years of Progress
　　-- Written for the Inauguration of the Russian Edition of "People's China" --
　　Song Qingling
　　The thirty-third anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution symbolizes the continuous progress of the Soviet people and the people of the whole world over the past thirty-three years. This progress is shared by all working men and women. The beginning of this revolution showed their surging spirit to break free from shackles. Over the years, it has been consolidated in the name of the unity of the world's working class. To this day, the Soviet Union remains a bright light, guiding all workers towards their future.
　　There are many reasons why the October Socialist Revolution and its thirty-three years of progress are of immortal significance to the working people, the main one being that they have dealt fatal blows to many basic concepts, many erroneous "correct views" in bourgeois-imperialist thought.
　　For example, "There can be no production without capitalists or their managers." This sentence has long deafened us. It is nothing more than to make the workers forever obey the arbitrary dictates of the capitalists. It is nothing more than to make the workers believe that they cannot hope to promote industry on their own, that they cannot handle technology, engineering, and inventions. This complex "mental labor" is not something that simple-minded, manual laborers can do. This work should only be left to special people. These people, relying on their superior position, traditional conditions, stealing or conspiring skills, control the means of production. Workers should not oppose this control, otherwise they will destroy production.
　　After the founding of the Soviet Union, this concept was immediately swept away. The Soviet workers proved that without those exploiting bosses, or war-mongering cartel entrepreneurs and monopoly capitalists, the people could create miracles. Millions of them rose from ordinary workers to prove that workers can also manage industries of all sizes very well, they can also design, can build, and especially can properly allocate their massive productivity. This means that capitalist ideology has suffered a disastrous defeat, and all the workers have achieved brilliant success.
　　Another example: "Socialism is an impractical dream." This sentence is used to defend chronic unemployment and the periodic crises that erode the capitalist economy. Its purpose is to make people believe that it is useless to oppose unbalanced development and over-exploitation of resources, or to oppose attempts to employ all labor for profit. These ideas are just the opinions of utopian dreamers. Anyone who wants to see through the truth and expose the truth of this lie will even suffer the crime of madness. In other words, no one is allowed to interfere with the control of the bosses.
　　Thirty-three years of progress in the Soviet Union have turned this idea into a relic of history. Socialism has indeed been realized! The Soviet state, where the people hold power, stands before our eyes. Socialism is thriving and flourishing. It is reflected in countless facts in production. It is reflected in the successive price cuts of daily necessities. It is reflected in the continuous rise in living standards and labor enthusiasm, a phenomenon that cannot be seen anywhere except in the realm of socialism. The Soviet Union has proved that socialism is by no means a dream. It, in the hands of every worker, is concrete and alive, now and in the future. Thus, another bourgeois idea was defeated.
　　There is also a piece of deception: "In undeveloped areas, large-scale industrialization can only rely on foreign capitalists." This means that imperialists will not invest in any country unless there is an opportunity to extract more than ordinary profits. Therefore, if you do not give them all kinds of privileges, if you do not hand over the control of economic and political institutions to them or their accomplices, then your land will only sink into the backwardness of the feudal era.
　　This concept has been refuted beyond any doubt. The Soviet Union has proved, and all colonial countries will prove in due course with their own facts, that in the final analysis, imperialists will not help others industrialize, but will actually hinder their industrialization, their industrial concepts are narrow and harmful to national development. Therefore, a backward country that wants to industrialize and raise its agriculture to the level of mechanization and socialization must rely on the strength of its own people. In the early days of the founding of the Soviet Union, surrounded by enemies, this heavy burden was entirely placed on the shoulders of the Soviet people. But today, thanks to thirty-three years of progress, some originally backward and now liberated countries, in addition to their own strength, have also received the fraternal help of the Soviet Union. This means that the need to rely on foreign funds is increasingly reduced. It also buries the idea of relying on foreign selfish "help" to modernize a country in the distant past.
　　There is also a lie: "It is natural for people of different races, colors, and customs to kill each other. They need a strong hand to control them and save them from themselves." According to this false "philosophy", imperialist countries claim to be this "strong controlling hand". In the process of control, they enslaved millions of people, extracted billions of wealth for their own benefit, established empires, and once ran rampant throughout the world. They were able to do so on the one hand by fabricating excuses to provoke others to be hostile to each other, and on the other hand by blinding the warring parties so that they would not understand the fact that unity is better than mutual harm. Imperialists implement this policy between countries and even within their own jurisdictions, for no other purpose than to facilitate their rule and exploitation.
　　Now, this policy has also been effectively hit, and is collapsing in the dying financial kingdom. Since 1917, the experience of the Soviet Union has revealed the full truth of the viciousness of this concept. In this great country with many nationalities and races, thanks to Stalin's instructions in the "national question", different nationalities have begun to live together as never before, peacefully, equally, cooperating for the goal of construction, exchanging culture, and exchanging sincere brotherly friendship. Because people all over the world can see examples of true equality, there can no longer be racial, color, or custom boundaries between people.
　　When you consider these and many other victories achieved by the Soviet Union, you will see how great the contribution of the Great October Socialist Revolution and its thirty-three years of progress has been to mankind! They show the fact that bourgeois ideas are based on absurdity, while socialist ideas are rooted in science. They illustrate how capitalism exists only for the benefit of a few, while the people's state works only for the welfare of the masses. Finally, they come to the conclusion that capitalism leads to war, while socialism only strives for peace.
　　Let's make a comparison between the two sides. Look at the American armed aggression against Korea, and then look at its economic aggression against Western Europe and Southeast Asia. Look at the Soviet Union sending technical personnel and industrial assistance to Eastern European democratic countries and the people of Asia. Look at the great Soviet Union constantly sending cultural groups and professors to its friends. Compare the declining economy of the United States and its mad arms race with the thriving life of the Soviet Union and its amazing construction, such as dams, huge canals dug for water conservancy, large-scale afforestation, and control of nature everywhere for the benefit of mankind.
　　There is no doubt about it. All working men and women in the world will see the results of this comparison in all aspects. Therefore, they deeply understand the importance and significance of the thirty-third anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution. Therefore, on this day, we will hear the world shouting in various languages:
　　Long live world peace!
　　Long live the Soviet Union!
　　Long live the Soviet people!
　　Long live Stalin!

　　三十三年的进步
    ——为“人民中国”俄文版创刊而作——
    宋庆龄
    伟大的十月社会主义革命的三十三周年象征了三十三年来苏维埃人民以及全世界人民不断的进步。这种进步是为一切劳动的男女所共有的。这次革命的开端表现了他们挣脱锁枷的澎湃气势。这些年来，它在世界工人阶级团结的名义之下巩固起来。直到今天，苏联仍然是一道灿烂的光芒，照引着所有的工人向他们的前途迈进。
    十月社会主义革命及三十三年来的进步对于劳动人民有着永垂不朽的意义是有许多理由的，其中主要的是它们曾向许多基本观念，资产阶级——帝国主义思想中的许多谬误的“正确观点”，施以致命的打击。
    例如，“没有资本家或者他们的经理人，就不可能有任何生产。”这句话老早就使我们刺耳欲聋。它无非是要使工人永远服从资本家的任意摆布。无非是使工人相信：凭他们自己是不能希望把工业推动起来的，他们是搞不好技术、工程和发明的。这种复杂的“脑力劳动”不是头脑简单，徒手劳作的人们所能胜任的。这种工作只有留待特种的人去做。这种人倚仗着优越的地位，传统的条件，偷窃或阴谋的技俩，管制了生产手段。工人是不该反对这种管制的，否则他们就会破坏了生产。
    苏联建国之后，这种观念立即扫除干净。苏联的工人证明了：没有那些从事剥削的老板，或从事战争的卡特尔企业家和垄断资本家，人民就能够创造奇迹。他们成百万地从普通工人当中起来证明：工人也能够把各种规模的工业管理得非常出色，他们也能够设计，能够建设，尤其是能够把他们的大量生产力分配妥善。这就是说，资本主义思想遭遇了惨败，而全体的工人获得了光辉的成就。
    再举一个例：“社会主义是不切实际的梦想。”这句话是用来为慢性的失业现象和侵蚀着资本主义经济的周期性危机来辩护的。它的用意无非要人相信：反对不平衡发展和过度开发资源，或者反对雇用所有的劳动力以谋利的企图，都是没有用处的。这些念头只是乌托邦梦想家的意见而已。如果谁要透视真理，揭破这句谎话的真相，谁就甚至会蒙受疯狂的罪名。换言之，谁都不许干搅老板们的管制。
    苏联三十三年来的进步已使这种思想变为历史的陈迹。社会主义果然实现了！人民掌握政权的苏维埃国家矗立在我们的眼前。社会主义正在生气勃勃，发扬光大起来。它表现在生产方面屈指难数的事实。它表现在日用品接二连三的跌价。它表现在生活水准和劳动热情的不断上升，这种现象除了在社会主义的境界内，在任何地方都不能重见的。苏联已经证明了社会主义绝不是梦想。它，掌握在每个工人的手里，是具体的而且是活生生的，现在如此，将来也如此。于是乎又一个资产阶级的观念被打垮了。
    还有一片欺人之谈：“在没有开发的地区，大规模的工业化只有倚赖国外的资本家。”这就是说：除非有榨取超过寻常的利润的机会，帝国主义者是不会向任何国家投资的。因此，你如果不给他们种种的特权，你如果不把经济政治机构的管制权交付给他们或他们的同伙，那么你的土地只有沉沦在封建时代的落后中。
    这一个观念已经被驳斥得毫无怀疑的余地了。苏联已经证明，一切殖民地国家到了相当时候也将以他们自己的事实来证明：归根结底帝国主义者不会帮助人家工业化，反而实际上阻碍人家工业化，他们的工业观念是狭窄的而且于民族发展有害的。因此，一个落后的国家想要工业化，想要提高它的农业到机械化和社会化的水准，非依仗人民自己的力量不可。在苏联建国的初期，四面皆敌，这副重担完全放在苏联人民的肩上。可是到了今天，由于三十三年来的进步，一些原来落后而今获得解放的国家除了本身的力量以外还得到了苏联情同手足的帮助。这就是说：依赖外来资金的需要愈加减少了。也就是把依赖外来的自私自利的“帮助”来使一个国家现代化的观念葬送到遥远的古代去了。
    还有一句谎话：“不同种族、肤色和风俗的人民互相残杀是自然的。他们需要一只强有力的手来控制他们，把他们从自身之中解救出来”。根据这片虚伪的“哲理”，帝国主义国家自命为这只“强有力的控制的手”。他们在控制的过程中奴役了千百万人民，榨取了亿万财富以自肥，建立帝国，并且一度横行全世界。他们所以能够如此是一方面凭借着莫须有的口实来挑唆别人互相敌对，一方面蒙蔽交战的双方不让他们明白团结胜于互相残害的事实。帝国主义者在国与国之间甚至在他们统辖范围之内都施行着这种政策，其目的无非是为了便利他们的统治和剥削而已。
    现在，这种政策也遭受到有效的打击，并且在金融王国的垂危中正在垮台了。一九一七年以来苏联的经验已经揭露了这种观念的恶毒的全部真相。在这个有着许多民族和种族的伟大国度中，由于斯大林在“民族问题”中的指示，不同的民族亘古未有地开始生活在一处，和平，平等，为建设的目标而合作，交流着文化，交流着真诚的兄弟般的友爱。由于全世界的人都能看到真正平等的实例，人与人之间再不可能有种族、肤色或风俗的界线了。
    当你思考苏联所获得的这些和其他的许多胜利时，你就会看到伟大的十月社会主义革命及其三十三年来的进步对于人类的贡献显得多么伟大！它们表明了这件事实：资产阶级的思想是建基于荒诞无稽的上面，而社会主义的思想是植根于科学之中。它们说明了资本主义如何仅仅为了少数人谋利而存在，而人民的国家却仅为大众的福利而工作。最后它们并归根到这个结论：资本主义走向战争，而社会主义只是争取和平。
    且把双方作一比较罢。试看美国的武装侵略朝鲜，再看它对西欧和东南亚的经济侵略。请看苏联派送技术人才和工业协助到东欧民主国家和人民的亚洲。再看伟大的苏联不断地送出文化团体和教授们，走向它的友人中去。比较一下美国的衰落的经济及其疯狂的备战和苏联的茁壮的生命及其令人惊叹的建设，如水闸，巨大的为水利而开掘的运河，大规模的造林，到处都在控制自然，为人类谋福利。
    这是毫无疑问的。世界上一切的劳动男女都会看到在各方面所得出的这一比较的结果的。因此，他们深深了解到十月社会主义革命的三十三周年的重要与意义。因此，在这个日子，我们将听到世界上各种语言都在高呼：
    世界和平万岁！
    苏维埃联邦万岁！
    苏维埃人民万岁！
    斯大林万岁！
