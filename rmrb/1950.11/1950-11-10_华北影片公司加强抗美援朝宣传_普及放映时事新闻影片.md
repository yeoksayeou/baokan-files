    The North China Film Management Company, in order to enhance the general public's understanding of Resisting America and Aiding Korea, has specially edited the "New China Briefing" newsreel produced by the Beijing Film Studio. The content includes: opposition to American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea, a Korean picture exhibition, protests against American planes invading Northeast China, the peace signature campaign, terrorist atrocities, and Army Day. With the support of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee's Propaganda Department, and with the assistance of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, two screening teams were formed to begin screenings in various districts of Beijing on the 4th of this month. As of the 6th, the audience number for three days was 41,600. In order to make it more widespread, in addition to continuing screenings in the city, the company will also lend the film to the People's Revolutionary University for screenings in the western suburbs and rural areas.
