　　Resisting America, Aiding Korea, Defending the Nation
    Dalian Workers Display High Labor Enthusiasm
    More Effort, More Brainpower, One Person Doing the Work of Two.
    [Report from this newspaper] According to news from the Dalian People's Daily: Dalian workers are transforming their deep hatred for American imperialism into strength, displaying high labor enthusiasm, putting in more effort, using more brainpower, and employing various methods to increase production and strengthen the nation's power. The actions of Dalian workers demonstrate the conscious vanguard role of the Chinese working class in resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending the nation.

    Completing the task one hour earlier means defeating the invaders one hour earlier!

    In the Li Hua Iron Factory, the workers have drawn ugly caricatures of MacArthur and other war criminals all over the rolling mills and on the iron plates beside the machines. The rolling mill workers have written beside the drawings, "Use the rolling mill to draw your tendons!" After the various production teams in the factory challenged each other, production results became higher and higher. In the competition, the Fourth Continuous Rolling Team averaged 17.88% above the production quota, the Fifth Continuous Rolling Team averaged 27.2% above the quota, and the Cutting Team averaged 40% above the quota. They are now preparing to further improve product quality.

    In the Jin Gou workshop of the Yuandian Metal Machinery Factory, after the launch of the anti-American aggression production competition on October 20th, the workers didn't even bother to smoke during work. The workers said with anger, "American devils, we have iron fists!" With everyone working hard, the task was completed two days ahead of schedule. Electric welders, in order to improve quality in the anti-American aggression production competition, assigned a dedicated person to be responsible for each job. In the past, the slag after welding was removed by third-grade workers. This time, whoever finished welding removed the slag, thus saving labor. Under the workers' slogans of "Removing the welding slag is equal to overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek; Good quality control, no American bandits can escape," the quality has improved compared to the past.

    On the last day of October, the Railcar Branch of the Railway Factory only had one refrigerator car left to complete for the entire month's task. As soon as the lathe shift workers took over, team leader Zhang Longjiang rushed to the wheel group and said to the workers, pointing to the wheels: "We must work harder. Completing the task one hour earlier means eliminating the American invaders one hour earlier!" The workers all said when they heard it, "That's right!" Young worker Yang Zhenfang, while working at the lathe, planned: "One car has eight wheels. Seven wheels have already been completed. There is one wheel left. If we work at the usual pace, it will take eight hours, and the task will not be completed." He concentrated his energy, pushed the power switch, and the lathe turned the wheel like a grinding stone. He inserted the tool, and the iron filings flew up like sparks. It was already past noon (the Railway Factory has lunch at 11:00 AM), but he didn't feel hungry at all, happily looking at the wheel that was completed in just four hours. His face showed particular joy. When the workers operating the top bed placed the wheel on the axle, advanced worker Wang Zhenfa did not delay either. He readily pulled the small hoist, lifting the pair of wheels to his own lathe, and said to his co-worker Li Huaide: "This is the time to eliminate the American aggressors. We must raise our spirits!" Worker Li nodded and said: "Guarantee to eliminate them ahead of schedule!" One and a half hours of work was completed in one hour. Worker Wang sent it to the axle pressing lathe. The two famous tall guys in the factory, Ding Laiming and Fang Baojiang, bent over at the three-foot-high axle pressing lathe and were already sweating. Worker Ding said to worker Fang: "What reason do you think the American imperialists have for invading Korea?" Worker Fang said: "No reason at all. That’s why I must actively produce to support the Korean people. American imperialism is like looking for death (shit) with a lantern to pick up dung!" The two of them finished pressing an axle end while talking. Ding Laiming looked at his watch and said with a smile to worker Fang: "Lao Fang, how is it so fast? It only took thirty minutes. It used to take at least fifty minutes!" "Strive for the final victory, the faster the better." Worker Fang replied, wiping his face with a towel. In this tense manner, the entire process of drilling, roughing, topping the wheels, and pressing the ends was completed, and then it was sent to the squaring department. The last car of the day successfully left the factory. Team leader Zhang Longjiang summed it up and said: "Today we did two days' worth of work."

    To protect the motherland and my mother, I cannot go back!

    Lai Yusheng, a lathe worker in the Railcar Branch of the Railway Factory, created a new record of turning eighteen freight car wheels in six and a half hours during the anti-American aggression and national defense production competition, increasing production efficiency by 30%. In November, their group of four was determined to complete 300 axles (in October it was 170), guaranteeing good quality. It happened that at this time, his mother's lung disease was serious, and two registered letters in a row came from his hometown of Fushan, urging him to return. He wrote back to his mother, saying: The American imperialists are frantically invading our friendly neighbor Korea, their military planes are invading our airspace, strafing our compatriots, and American planes have also invaded our hometown (Fushan). Mother, you saw it. The despicable and shameless methods of the American imperialists are more poisonous than the Japanese devils. In order to strengthen the power of the motherland and protect the motherland and you, my mother, I cannot go back. I want to strive to become a glorious Communist Party member and a model of anti-American aggression production.

    144 hours of work completed in 96 hours

    Workers at the Dalian Mechanical Electrode Factory, after they finished burning a kiln of electrodes, the supervisors asked them to rest, but team leader Li Yanyou and Qu Cunwu said: "No need to rest. We workers gain strength when we think of the enemy, guaranteeing that one person can do the work of two." They said angrily: "We wish we could hit those American devils to death with a fire hook!" The next day, the two of them did the work of four people. When burning and loading electrodes on October 17th, after team leader Li Yanyou rationally divided the work, 144 hours of work was completed in 96 hours. One person did the furnace firing work of two people. This was the result of Li Yanyou's rational division of labor and joint efforts. Zhao Jinwen said: "Completing it one hour earlier means the American devils will die one hour sooner." During this anti-American aggression production competition, Comrade Li Yanyou came up with a method: after loading the electrodes, those in front took care of the chimneys, and those in the back loaded coke powder and covered firebricks, saving 33% of working hours. Song Mingyi, a worker at the Dalian Mechanical Electrode Factory, is 65 years old this year. He said: "I am over sixty years old this year, and I have only had two years of good life. The American imperialists want to come and make trouble again. I wish I could take a kitchen knife and chop them to death." Young League members Sun Yuyuan and Sun Jingqi studied the method of burning the furnace. In the past, burning the furnace for eight hours produced six or seven carts of furnace ash. On average, coal had to be added six or seven times per hour, and the ash after burning was completely coal alkali, which wasted coal and did not generate heat, and people had to work hard, and the fire mouth was always black. This time, he came up with a method of adding less coal and cleaning the furnace more often. After adding coal, stir it with a fire hook after a few minutes. In this way, the firepower is great, the temperature rises quickly and it saves coal. Only two carts of furnace ash are produced in eight hours.

    Loading cement ahead of schedule means hitting the American devils.

    Workers in the loading and packaging workshops of the Yuandian Cement Factory improved their work efficiency in the anti-American aggression production competition. On October 22nd, the factory issued an emergency task to load cement, and the shifts were reorganized. Team leader Li Xianchun proposed: "Loading cement ahead of schedule means hitting the American devils." After finishing his after-work studies, Sun Peiyu automatically helped the workers on the second shift load the train. Guo Qingsheng and other seven workers did not go home at night and automatically stayed at the factory to wait for the train to come and load it. Li Xianchun and Wang Dengming, who worked the first shift starting at 8:00 AM, often arrived at the factory at 5:00 AM. On the morning of the 24th, worker Fang Zhaofa was working the third shift. When he was sleeping at home, he heard that the train had arrived at the factory, and he didn't even bother to sleep, so he went to the factory to help load the train. Because everyone was of one mind, a competition was launched. On October 24th, the highest tonnage of loading in September was greatly exceeded, and on the 26th, it was increased by more than 100 tons. The packaging workers also created achievements that the factory had never seen before.

    Not only put in more effort, but also use more brainpower. Wang Taixing increases production efficiency by 40 times.

    Wang Taixing, a worker in the riveting workshop of a certain factory, said to the workers in his group during the anti-American aggression production competition: "In order to increase the power to resist American imperialism, we must put in more effort and use more brainpower." Their job was to repair pipes. On October 24th, they received the task of making six-layer coiled pipes with a diameter of one and a half inches. Wang Taixing spent a day designing a rotatable form that could be used to bend the pipes. It was no longer necessary to heat them red before bending them as in the past, and it was only necessary to heat them once for each turn. The new method not only improved efficiency, but the biggest advantage was that it could extend the service life of the pipes, because there was a layer of anti-rust "lead skin" inside the pipes. If it was exposed to fire several times, the lead skin would burn off.

    In the past, a maximum of four such pipes could be coiled in a day, but on the 25th, they made ten in just half an hour.

    Technical personnel's patriotic contribution to resisting America. Cao Renming makes a vacuum suction cotton machine.

    Spinning machines at the Jinzhou Textile Factory often have yarn ends sticking out, which is the biggest difficulty in each spinning workshop of the factory. It is also the biggest difficulty for spinning workers in textile factories across the country. When the yarn ends stick out and the machine blooms, the spinning workers watching the machine are too busy, and the output will be reduced, and the quality of the yarn will also be affected. At the same time, in spinning factory workshops without ventilation equipment, the air will be filled with flying cotton wool, which spinning workers inhale into their nostrils and trachea, causing occupational diseases. "How can we overcome the difficulty of spinning machine yarn ends sticking out?" This is a question that many spinning workers have raised to the technical staff in the hope of finding a solution.

    This problem has been solved after Jinzhou Textile technician Cao Renming successfully tested the vacuum suction cotton machine.

    Now this light blue vacuum suction cotton machine is installed on spinning machine No. 1 in the spinning room of the third spinning workshop. It works continuously with the rotation of the machine every day and has played a certain role, which has attracted widespread attention from all parties. Technician Cao Renming is continuing to research and make further improvements in order to achieve complete practicality.

　　抗美援朝保家卫国
    旅大工人发挥高度劳动热忱
    多出力气，多动脑筋，一个人当两个人用。
    【本报讯】据旅大人民日报消息：旅大工人正把对美帝国主义的千仇万恨化为力量，发挥高度的劳动热忱，多出力气，多动脑筋，用各种办法提高生产，增强国家力量。旅大工人的行动表现了中国工人阶级对抗美援朝保家卫国的自觉的先锋作用。
    早一点钟完成任务，就早一点钟打败侵略者！
    利华铁厂的工友在压延机上或机器旁边的铁板上，都画满了麦克阿瑟等战犯的丑像，压延工人们在画的旁边写着“用压延机来抽你的筋！”该厂各生产组互相挑战应战后，生产成绩一组比一组高。四连伸铁组在竞赛当中，平均超过生产定额一七·八八％，五连伸铁组平均超过定额二七·二％，切铁组平均超过定额四○％，现正准备进一步提高产品质量。
    远电金属机械工厂金构场，十月二十日开展反美侵略生产竞赛后，工作中，工人们连烟都顾不得吸。工人们愤恨的说：“美国鬼，我们有铁拳头！”在大家紧张的工作下，任务提前两天完成。电火工人为在反美侵略生产竞赛中把质量提高一步，每一工作都是专人负责。过去活焊完后的药皮，都是找三级工人来打。这次却是谁焊完谁打，因此节省了人工。在工人们：“打掉焊药等于打倒蒋介石；检查质量好，美国强盗一个也跑不了”的口号下，质量已比过去提高。
    当十月份最后一天，铁路工厂台车分厂的全月任务就剩下一台冷藏车未完成，车床班的工友刚接班，张龙江班长急急忙忙的跑到车轮组，一面指着车轮，一面对工友们说：咱们要加劲干，提前一点钟完成任务，就是提前一点钟消灭美国强盗！”工友们一听都说：“对！”青年工友杨贞方一面往床子上把着活，一面自己计划着：“一台车是八个轮，现在已经完成七个啦，还剩一个轮，要按过去干八小时，这个任务就完不成啦。”他聚精提神，把电门一推，车床驼着一个车轮像盘磨似的转起来，他把刀往上一插，铁末子像飞一样崩起来。已经到了十二点（铁路工厂是十一点吃午饭），他一点也没觉着饿，美滋滋望着这个仅用四小时完成的车轮，脸上表现得特别愉快，当顶床子工友把车轮顶在车轴上，先进工作者王振发更不怠慢，他顺手把小吊一拉，吊着这副车轮把在自己床子上，又对和他一块干活的李怀德工友说：“这就是消灭美国侵略者的时候，要把精神抖起来！”李工友点了点头说：“保证提前把它消灭！”一小时半的工作一小时完成了。王工友又把它送到压轴头床子。全厂有名的两个大个子，丁来明和方宝江二工友，弯着腰在三尺高的压轴头床子上，已经累的冒汗了，丁工友对方工友说：“你说美帝侵略朝鲜有什么理由？”方工友说：“什么理由也没有。所以我才要积极生产支援朝鲜人民，美帝国主义就是打灯笼捡粪找死（屎）！”他二人说着一副轴头压完了。丁来明看了看手表，笑嘻嘻地对方工友说：“老方，怎么这么快，才干了三十分钟，过去顶快也得五十分钟！”“争取最后的胜利，越快越好。”方工友回答着，又拿手巾揩了揩脸。就这样紧张的，掏眼、刮荒、顶轮、压头全部完成了，然后关到对车部，在当天晚上最后的一辆车胜利的出了厂，张龙江班长总结了一下说：“今天一天干了两天的活。”
    为了保卫祖国和母亲，我不能回去！
    铁路工厂台车分厂车床工人赖玉声，在抗美援朝保家卫国的生产竞赛中，创造了六个半小时车十八个货车车轮的新纪录，提高生产效率百分之三○；十一月份他们小组四个人，决心完成三百根车轴（十月份是一七○根），保证质量好。恰巧这时，他母亲肺病严重，从家乡福山一连来了两封挂号信，催他回去。他回信告诉母亲说：美帝这样疯狂侵略我们的友邻朝鲜，它的军用飞机侵入我们领空，扫射我们同胞，美国飞机还侵入咱们故乡（福山）的事，母亲是看到了的，美帝这种卑鄙无耻的手段比日本鬼子还毒，我为了增强祖国力量，保卫祖国与母亲你，我不能回去。我要在生产中争取当上一个光荣的共产党员，和抗美侵略生产模范。
    一百四十四点钟的活  九十六点钟就完成了
    大连机械电极场工人，当他们紧张的烧完了一窑电极之后，上级叫他们休息时，组长李延佑和曲存武说：“不用休息，我们工人阶级一想起敌人就有了力量，保证一个人能当两个人用。”他们气愤地说：“我们恨不得一火钩子打死那美国鬼子！”第二天他们两个人就干了四个人的活。十月十七日烧装电极的时候，李延佑组长合理分工之后，一百四十四点钟的活，九十六点钟就完成了。两个人的烧炉工作一个人就干了。这是李延佑组长合理分工一齐努力的结果。赵锦文说：“是提前完成一点钟，美国鬼子就早死亡一点钟。”在这次反美侵略生产竞赛当中，李延佑同志想出了办法：装完电极，前面理烟筒，后面就装燋面子和盖耐火砖，节省工时百分之三十三。大连机械电极场工人宋明义今年六十五岁了，他说：“我今年六十多了，这一辈子才过二年好日子，美帝又想来捣乱，我恨不能拿菜刀去把他们劈死。”青年团员孙玉袁和孙敬起研究了烧炉的办法，过去烧炉八小时出六、七车炉灰，平均一点钟要加六七次煤，而烧完了的灰完全是煤碱，又费煤又不爱上热，人又出力，火口里老是发黑。这次，他想出少加煤，多清炉的办法，加上煤后，住几分钟再用火钩子翻一遍，这样火力很大，温度升的很快又省煤，八小时只出两车炉灰。
    提前装好洋灰，也就是打击了美国鬼子。
    远电洋灰工厂装车、包装两车间工友在反美侵略生产竞赛中，工作效率提高。十月二十二日，厂方下来装洋灰的紧急任务，就重新分了班。李宪春班长提出：“提前装好洋灰，也就是打击了美国鬼子。”孙培余下班学习完后，自动帮助二班工友装车。郭清盛等七名工人，晚上不回家，自动留在厂里等火车来了装车。李宪春、王登明头班八点上班，经常五点钟就到厂。二十四日上午，房兆发工友干三班，在家里睡觉时听见工厂来了火车，觉也顾不得睡，便到厂子去帮助装车。由于大家一条心，掀起了竞赛，十月二十四日大大超过九月份装车最高吨数，二十六日又提高一百多吨。包装工人也创出了该厂历来未有的成绩。
    多出力气，也要多动脑子，王泰兴生产效率提高四十倍
    某厂铆工场工人王泰兴，在抗美援朝的生产竞赛中对他小组里的工人说：“为了增加反抗美帝的力量，要多出力气，也要多动脑子。”他们的工作是修理管子，十月二十四日，他们接到的任务是做一寸半粗的六层盘肠管子。王泰兴化了一天的时间，设计了一个能转的胎，把管子放上就可以绕成弯；用不着像过去那样烧红了才能弯，绕一圈就得烧一次。用新的方法不仅提高了效率，最大的好处在于可以延长管子的使用寿命，因为管子里有一层防锈的“铅皮”，如果经几次火，铅皮就烧掉了。
    过去作这种管子，一天最多可以盘四个，但二十五日那一天，他们只用了半小时就作出了十个。
    技术人员的抗美爱国贡献曹任明制成真空吸棒棉器
    金州纺织厂精纺机纺纱经常冒头，这是工厂各精纺车间的最大困难。同样也是各地纺织工厂的纺纱工人们的最大困难。线头冒了，车上开了花，看机的纺纱工人们就忙不过来，产量会因此降低，纱的质量也会受到影响。同时在没有通风装置的纺纱厂车间，空中会因此充满了飞棉絮，纺纱工人们把它吸到鼻孔内、气管内，就会发生职业病。“怎样才能克服精纺冒头的困难呢？”这是许多纺纱工人们，提给技术人员的一个希望能得到解决的问题。
    这个问题在金纺技术员曹任明的试造真空吸棒棉器成功后，已经得到了解决。
    现在这一架淡蓝色的真空吸棒棉器，装在第三纺纱场精纺间的一号精纺机上，每天不停地跟着车子的回转而工作，发挥了一定的效能，已引起各方面广泛的注意。技术员曹任明正在继续研究，作进一步的改良，以期达到完全实用。
