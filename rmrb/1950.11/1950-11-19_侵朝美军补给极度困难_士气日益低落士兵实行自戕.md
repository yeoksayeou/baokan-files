　　U.S. Troops Invading Korea Face Extreme Supply Difficulties
    Morale Declines Daily, Soldiers Commit Self-Harm
    [Xinhua News Agency, 17th] U.S. troops invading Korea are facing extreme difficulties in supply and replenishment, leading to a daily decline in morale and even instances of self-harm. According to a United Press Washington dispatch on the 14th, a U.S. Army spokesman admitted at a press conference that transporting clothing and other supplies to U.S. troops fighting in northern Korea is "a very difficult problem." The "majority" of U.S. troops in Korea "have not yet received leather coats and other thick winter clothing." As a result, American soldiers, "teary-eyed from the cold," are "still walking around wearing two or three layers of summer uniforms" (Guoxin News Agency, 15th), facing the "extreme danger of frozen hands, feet, and faces" (Associated Press, 13th).
    The American invading army's predicament is mainly due to the fact that the U.S. military's rear is too far from the front lines, the supply lines are extended, and the fierce activities of the Korean People's Guerrillas behind enemy lines are also seriously threatening the enemy's transportation lines. According to a Guoxin News Agency dispatch on the 18th, the U.S. Eighth Army headquarters had to admit that the supplies currently received on the Korean front are transported by planes and ships entering and leaving Chinnampo.
    The difficulty of supply not only prevents the American invading army from wearing winter clothing but also makes it impossible to supply other war equipment. According to an Associated Press Tokyo dispatch on the 15th, U.S. Marines not only lack winter clothing but also lack "transportation and even carbine bullets." American officers and soldiers who cannot endure hardship and believe only in weapons complain that they are waging a "stingy war." A Marine officer who dared not reveal his name said that if the American army does not get some equipment, they will be "beaten to a bloody pulp." A Guoxin News Agency front-line dispatch on the 15th quoted a U.S. staff officer as saying that he "frankly admitted: if the situation of the past few days continues, this may be the most difficult winter war the U.S. military has ever fought."
    According to an Associated Press report on the 14th, U.S. invading soldiers, in conditions where "the severe cold is almost as fierce as the enemy," have had "considerable emotional fluctuations," and even committed self-harm in an attempt to escape. According to United Press reporter Chapman on the 15th, an accompanying surgeon in Bochuan confirmed that four U.S. soldiers, unable to withstand the "unprecedented extreme cold of minus twenty degrees," used guns to injure their own legs and feet in order to be sent to the "warm rear."

### 侵朝美军补给极度困难  士气日益低落士兵实行自戕

　　侵朝美军补给极度困难
    士气日益低落士兵实行自戕
    【新华社十七日讯】侵朝美军由于供应和补给的极度困难，因而士气日益低落，并已引起了自戕的现象。据合众社华盛顿十四日电，美陆军发言人在招待记者会上承认，运送服装及其他供应品给在朝鲜北部作战的美军，是“一个非常困难的问题”。朝鲜境内美军“大多数尚未领到皮外套及其他御寒的厚衣”。由于这样，被“冻得流泪”的美国士兵，“许多人仍穿着两三层夏季军服走来走去”（国新社十五日电），面临着“冻手、冻脚、冻脸的极度危险”（美联社十三日电）。
    美国侵略军处境如此狼狈，主要原因是美军的后方离开前线太远，供应线延长，而朝鲜人民游击队在敌后的猛烈活动，也严重地威胁着敌军的运输线。据国新社十八日电，美国第八军军部不得不承认：现在朝鲜前线接到的供应品，是由飞机和镇南浦出进的船只运来的。
    补给的困难不仅使美国侵略军队穿不上冬衣，而且还供应不上其他的战争装备。据美联社东京十五日讯：美国海军陆战队的兵士不仅缺少冬衣，还缺少“运输工具，甚至卡宾枪的子弹”。吃不了苦、“唯武器论”的美国官兵，抱怨他们在进行“吝啬的战争”。一个不敢发表姓名的海军陆战队的军官说：美国军队如果得不到一些装备，他们将“被打得头破血流”。国新社前线十五日电引美军一参谋官员的谈话，亦“率直地承认：如果过去数日的情况继续下去，这可能是美军所打的最为吃苦的一个冬季战”。
    据美联社十四日报道：美国侵略军队的士兵在“严寒几乎和敌人一样的厉害”的情况下，已在情绪上“引起了相当大的波动”，甚至实行自戕，以图逃避。据合众社记者查普曼十五日报道：博川的一个随军外科医生证实，四个美军士兵忍受不了“从未碰到过的零下二十度的酷寒”，曾用枪把自己的腿脚打伤，以便能被送到“温暖的后方去”。
