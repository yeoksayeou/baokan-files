Xinhua News Agency, 15th: Twelve people's organizations, including the China Peace Committee, Oppose American Aggression, have sent a telegram to British Prime Minister Attlee, severely protesting the obstruction of the Second World Peace Congress in Britain. The telegram reads: Mr. Attlee,
　　You have unreasonably erased the will of peace-loving people around the world and obstructed the Second World Peace Congress from being held in Sheffield. This is a violation of the interests of the safety of all mankind. Your despicable and shameless behavior is no different from the crimes committed by American war-mongers. We lodge a serious protest to you with incomparable anger.

Xinhua News Agency, 15th: According to a TASS report from Sheffield, the British Peace Committee and the Organizing Committee of the Second World Peace Congress jointly organized a mass meeting in Sheffield on the evening of the 13th. More than 3,000 people attended the meeting, including foreign representatives who came to Britain to attend the Peace Congress. Participants unanimously protested against the Labor government's sabotage of the Second World Peace Congress in Britain. The chairman of the meeting, Ecclesdon, said in his opening remarks: The Labor government refused entry to representatives of the Peace Congress in order to prevent the British people from seeing the truth about the struggle of progressive mankind for peace. This government has destroyed the principles of freedom and democracy without reservation. But this can only strengthen the determination of peace advocates and make them work harder to defend world peace. The people of Sheffield expressed their anger at the government's obstruction and demanded that the government publicly apologize to peace advocates.
    Clother, Chairman of the British Peace Committee, said: The British government's refusal to issue entry visas to representatives of the Peace Congress was acting on the orders of its American masters.
    Speakers at the meeting also included the famous French painter Picasso, the Vice-Dean of Canterbury, Johnson, the head of the Canadian delegation to the Second World Peace Congress, Wen Youzhang, the famous British scientist Bernal, and the famous Soviet writer Polevoy.
    Many people who could not enter the venue listened to the radio broadcast on the street.

Xinhua News Agency, 15th: According to comprehensive TASS news, the British people have protested against the British government's unreasonable actions to obstruct the Second World Peace Congress from being held in Britain. The National Council for Civil Liberties in Britain issued a statement on the 11th, stating: "This behavior of the British government has greatly shocked everyone who believes in a democratic way of life. The British democratic system is now being tested. Unless vigilance is strengthened and protests are made against actions that violate democracy at any time, the democratic system will be destroyed without reservation."
    Famous British actors Mallison, Marshall, Hood, and many other famous figures in the theater circle sent a letter to the British Home Office on the 11th, protesting against the government's measures to refuse entry visas to foreign representatives. Many workers' organizations also expressed deep indignation that the Peace Congress could not be held in Sheffield.

Xinhua News Agency, 14th: According to a TASS report from London, the British Peace Committee issued a statement in Sheffield on the 12th, stating: The British government has effectively prohibited the Second World Peace Congress from being held in Sheffield by using police tactics that are deeply hated by upright people to prevent many well-known foreign figures from entering the country. The British Peace Committee specifically protests against these actions of the government and welcomes the Polish government's wide opening of its borders so that all representatives attending the Congress can go to Warsaw to hold the meeting. The statement pointed out: The British people are deeply shocked and disgusted by the British government's attitude. All upright British people feel that this is our shame.
    The statement continued: The British Peace Committee is assisting all elected representatives to go to Warsaw to participate in the Congress, and calls on the British people to fight for peace with greater determination, and not to think that the British government's ban on holding the meeting in Britain is a setback in the struggle for peace, but should be regarded as an exposure of the true colors of the British government leaders. Now everyone is clearer: Peace will only be achieved when the people themselves fight for peace. We must unite with the people of all countries to save the current division of the world.

    你无理地抹杀了全世界爱好和平人民的意志，阻挠第二届保卫世界和平大会在设菲尔德举行。这是违反全人类安全的利益的。你这种卑劣无耻的行为与美国战争贩子们所犯的罪行毫无二致。我们以无比的愤怒向你提出严重的抗议。

    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社设菲尔德讯：英国和平委员会及第二届世界保卫和平大会组织委员会，于十三日晚在设菲尔德联合组织了群众大会。参加大会的有三千余人，前来英国出席和平大会的外国代表们亦出席了大会。与会者对工党政府破坏二届世界和平大会在英举行，一致表示抗议。大会主席艾克勒斯东致开会词称：工党政府拒绝和平大会代表入境，目的是使英国人民不能看到进步人类争取和平的斗争的真实情况。这个政府已把自由与民主的原则破坏无遗。但这只能增强和平拥护者的决心，使他们以更大的努力保卫世界和平。设菲尔德人民对政府的阻挠表示愤怒，要求政府向和平拥护者公开道歉。
    英国和平委员会主席克劳瑟说：英国政府拒发和平大会代表的入境签证，是遵照美国主子的命令行事的。
    在会上发言者尚有法国名画家皮加索、英国坎特伯雷副主教约翰逊、加拿大出席第二届世界和平大会代表团团长文幼章、英国名科学家贝尔纳及苏联名作家波列伏依等。
    许多未能进入会场的群众，都在街上静听无线电的广播。
    【新华社十五日讯】综合塔斯社消息：英国人民纷纷抗议英国政府阻挠第二届世界保卫和平大会在英举行的无理行动。英国公民自由权利全国委员会于十一日发表声明称：“英国政府这种行为，已使每一个信仰民主生活方式的人大为震惊。英国的民主制度现正受到考验，除非加强警惕并随时对违反民主的行动提出抗议，否则民主制度将被破坏无遗。”
    英国名演员马利逊、马沙尔、胡德及戏剧界名流多人，于十一日致函英国内政部，抗议政府拒发入境签证给外国代表的措置。许多工人组织也因和平大会不能在设菲尔德举行而表示了深切的愤慨。
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国和平委员会于十二日在设菲尔德发表声明称：英国政府由于使用了正直人民所深恶痛绝的警察手段来阻止许多外国知名人士入境，实际上已禁止了第二届世界保卫和平大会在设菲尔德举行。英国和平委员会特抗议政府的这些行为，并欢迎波兰政府把国境广为开放，使一切出席大会的代表们能够前往华沙举行会议。声明指出：英国人民对于英国政府这种态度深感震惊与厌恶。一切正直的英国人民都感到这是我们的耻辱。
    声明继称：英国和平委员会正协助所有被选出的代表到华沙去参加大会，并号召英国人民以更大的决心为争取和平而斗争，切莫以为英国政府禁止在英国开会是争取和平斗争的挫折，而应视为这是英国政府领袖们的一次原形暴露。现在大家都更清楚：只有当人民自己争取和平的时候，和平才会获得。我们必须与各国人民团结一致，以挽救目前世界的分裂局面。
