　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 21st. In September and October, the bandit suppression units of the Southwest Military Region of the People's Liberation Army completely annihilated 31 groups of remnant bandits who had fled into remote and deep mountainous areas, including 44 important bandit leaders from these groups.

　　Since early September, the bandit suppression forces of our Southwest Military Region have launched strict encirclement and suppression operations against the remaining bandits who fled to the border areas of northeast, northwest, and southeast Guizhou, the border areas of Xikang and Sichuan, the border areas of Yunnan and Guizhou, as well as the Fuxian Lake area east of Jiangchuan in Yunnan, and the Shuangbai area. By late October, all 31 groups of remaining secret agent bandits in the above-mentioned areas had been completely annihilated, and 44 important bandit leaders were successively eliminated. The main bandit leaders who were killed include Tian Dongyun, the bandit "Director of the Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou Military and Political Committee," concurrently "Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou Anti-Communist Guerrilla Army" and the pseudo "Confidential Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense" head in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou; Luo Xiangpei, the bandit "Commander of the 8th Corps of the Anti-Communist National Salvation Army"; Tan Xizhen, the bandit "Commander of the 4th District of the Sichuan-Guizhou-Hunan-Hubei Anti-Communist People's Self-Defense Army"; Shi Zhaozhou, the bandit "Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan-Guizhou-Hunan-Hubei People's Self-Defense Army" and concurrently "Commander-in-Chief of Northeastern Guizhou"; Cai Shikang, the bandit "Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan-Guizhou-Hunan-Hubei People's Self-Defense Army" and concurrently "Commander of the 237th Division"; Guo Baozhi, the bandit "Commander of the 1st Column of the Kangchuan Advance Army"; Qiao Zijun, the bandit "Commander of the 3rd Column"; and Yang Shucheng, the bandit "Commander of the Sichuan-Hunan Joint Command of the Chinese People's National Salvation Army," etc. The important bandit leaders who were captured include Yang Yongqing, the pseudo "Commander of the 1st Directly Subordinate Pacification General Team of the Ministry of National Defense"; Bo Jiahua, the bandit "Commander-in-Chief of the Guizhou-South People's Anti-Communist Assault Army" and concurrently pseudo "Military Commissioner of the Confidential Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense" stationed in the Southwest Region; Lü Zhenhua, the bandit "Commander of the 3rd Army of the Sichuan-Yunnan-Kang Anti-Communist Guerrilla Advance Army"; Song Minwen, the bandit "Commander of the 2nd Route of the Sichuan-Yunnan Border Advance Army"; Xie Shiqin, the bandit "Commander of the Southeastern Guizhou Pacification Zone"; Jin Shaoyun, the bandit "Commander of the Dianzhong Independent Division of the Yunnan People's Self-Defense Army"; Kong Xuefan, the bandit "Deputy Commander of the Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou Anti-Communist Guerrilla Army"; Wang Xuechu, the bandit "Commander of the Chinese National Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," etc. Those who were forced to surrender to our bandit suppression troops include Luo Deqing, the bandit "Commander of the Southwest Anti-Communist Guerrilla Column," Zheng Daibi, the bandit "Deputy Commander of the Northern Guizhou Column," and Li Bingxuan, the bandit "Commander of the Guizhou Guerrilla Bandit Suppression," etc.

　　In this encirclement and suppression operation, our bandit suppression troops, in order to pursue and capture a bandit leader, tracked and captured them continuously for several days and nights, regardless of fatigue. When a certain unit was capturing the bandit Tan Xizhen, the soldiers went deep into uninhabited mountains, braving wind and rain, and searching all over the mountains and valleys, while sheltering from the rain under umbrellas in the mountain cliffs and jungles at night. In the strict and continuous search by our bandit suppression troops, the bandit Tan, who was hiding deep in the mountains, panicked and jumped off a cliff two-zhang deep in an attempt to escape, but our bandit suppression troops eventually killed Tan. When a certain unit entered the Maogong and Jinghua areas in northwestern Sichuan, they traveled 145 li in the rain, climbing the Kongka Mountain, which was covered in heavy snow and had thin air, and captured the hidden bandit leader Guan Zhongliang, etc. Along the way, Tibetan and Han people set off firecrackers and lined up to welcome the victorious return of the bandit suppression troops.

　　[This Newspaper News] According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Chongqing: Public security organs at all levels in the Southwest region have achieved results in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionary activities. In the ten months since the liberation of the Southwest, 6,008 Kuomintang special agents of all sizes have been captured, 13,598 special agents have voluntarily registered, 1,391 cases of conspiracy to riot have been uncovered, and 113 radio stations have been seized.
