　　A German Soldier's Story
    A Visit to the German Democratic Republic, Part 3
    Wu Wentao
    The Sunday noon after the German Youth Peace Conference, I was sitting in the guesthouse organizing my notes when suddenly, with the sound of a knock, a Free German Youth League (FDJ) member walked in, not in uniform, but wearing a badge. He said "Friendship!" (a greeting used among FDJ members) and sat down without any restraint. His expression was cheerful and full of vitality and confidence. He asked me for some materials on the Chinese youth movement, saying that the Free German Youth newspaper wanted to publish them. I took this opportunity to ask him about the situation of the youth from West Germany and West Berlin after returning from the meeting in the East Zone, and whether any incidents had occurred.

    "I'm sorry!" he said. "Although I live in the American sector of West Berlin, because I've been coming to the office early these past few days, I've had little chance to inquire about these things. I only know that the West Berlin newspapers are reporting that many young people who returned from the meeting have been arrested for promoting peace signatures."

    The fact that he lived in the American occupation zone caught my attention, so I asked him many questions, from prices to his family's clothing and food.

    He works in the editorial department of the *Young World* newspaper and earns 350 Republic Marks (East Marks) a month. After deducting 100 marks for social insurance and daily lunches in the public cafeteria, the government specially allows him to exchange 60% of the remaining money at a rate of one-to-one to pay for rent, electricity, and heating in West Berlin. Besides food, there's still about a hundred marks left over. His mother also works in East Berlin. She comes to East Berlin every day to buy daily necessities. His brand-new suit was recently bought from "HAO" (an abbreviation for democratic Germany's public store). He said, "I'm much better off than my brother. My brother is a disabled veteran with only one leg. He earns 180 West Marks a month, and after insurance and income tax, he only has a hundred or so marks left. He has a wife and two children, it's really tough. I was lucky not to be disabled during the war."

    "Were you also a soldier?"

    "Ah, I was! I was only released from an American prisoner-of-war camp in November 1948." At this point, he reached back to touch his light blond hair and pushed his yellow, wide-rimmed glasses up. His healthy, pinkish, squarish face showed a somewhat unnatural expression. After a moment, his young and energetic voice became heavy. He said:

    "If I am to tell how I changed from a Hitler's soldier to a member of the Free German Youth League, I must first express the shameful crimes of us Germans, who were used by the Nazis, against the people of the Soviet Union and other invaded countries." He paused, I nodded in agreement, and asked him to continue.

    His name is Gerhard Umlauff, and he is 29 years old this year. His father died in 1935, and the family was mainly supported by his mother working in a shop in Berlin. In 1940, while he was still in school, he was conscripted into the army. Due to his poor eyesight, he first entered the Air Force communications class for training. After graduation, he directed aircraft takeoffs and landings at airports in Greece, Czechoslovakia, and other places. In 1943, in Olomouc, an industrial area in northern Czechoslovakia, he was conscripted into a combat unit regardless of how bad his eyesight was. He and a group of companions were assigned to the airlift force.

    After the Battle of Stalingrad, he did not understand that Hitler's defeat was a foregone conclusion. However, he experienced the terror intensified by Hitler's SS and military police. He was originally assigned to be airlifted with the Spanish Blue Division to the Eastern Front, but because the British and American forces had already landed in France, although the Blue Division was still transferred to the Eastern Front, Umlauff and other temporarily collected stragglers formed another division and stayed on the Western Front. In February 1945, their company of eighty men, equipped with some heavy weapons, was ordered to defend a three-kilometer-long position near the Taksonburg fortress on the Franco-German border. When the American army occupied a small Eiffel hill opposite, the company commander ordered the eighty men to recapture it at dusk. Because American infantry was afraid of fighting at night and dared not fight without tanks or armored vehicles in front of them for cover.

    Umlauff saw me smile and continued:

    "Not only infantry, but take the air raids on Berlin, at night, the Americans always called on the British Air Force to take action, and the British Air Force naturally inevitably called on the Czech and other occupied countries' volunteer teams who were participating in the British Air Force at that time to take charge!"

    Umlauff was captured while seizing that hill. An American officer first searched him all over, took a gold pocket watch, and gave him an American cigarette as "reward." As Umlauff walked past the guard of the temporary detention center with that cigarette in his mouth, the guard unexpectedly slapped him in the face, his nose bled, and the cigarette was knocked out. After a while, he was escorted to a concentration camp, and passing the same guard again, this time, the guard, cursing, "You Hitler's bloody bastard," kicked him hard and casually gave him a full pack of "Camel" cigarettes.

    I couldn't help but laugh loudly and asked him why the American soldier did this. "Who knows?" he said, "This is probably the American way of life!"

    After that, he and other prisoners were transported to the United States. He told stories of how American prison officials taught them to learn the "American way of life." American instructors said that Germany's "democratization" could only be correct by learning the "American way of life."

    Along with over four hundred other German prisoners of war, he was sent to South Carolina to work. The employers paid the prisoner-of-war camp higher wages to hire people than they paid black people, and the managers only gave each person five cents a day, and the rest went into their own pockets. They worked alongside black people picking cotton and harvesting. He said, "At that time, this group of prisoners of war who had been educated in the Nazi 'superior race' ideology were of course not surprised by the beatings and rapes of black farmers. What surprised them was that the so-called 'democratic' 'American way of life' trumpeted by the 'Voice of America' was completely no different from the Nazi way of life!"

    In the spring of 1948, a riot broke out in Umlauff's prisoner-of-war camp because they heard news that the American authorities were negotiating with British capitalists to sell the prisoners of war. They unanimously demanded immediate repatriation. American officers threatened them, saying, "According to the Potsdam Agreement, all prisoners of war can be beheaded!" Finally, after many struggles, he and a small number of people returned to Germany in November 1948.

    However, after disembarking in Hamburg, seeing everything in his homeland, hearing the stories of relatives and friends, and seeing the shockingly high unemployment figures in West Germany published by the authorities, everyone's mood immediately fell into disappointment and confusion. Not long after, the British and American occupying authorities were reorganizing the German army, and like Hitler, were loudly calling for the elimination of the Bolsheviks.

    Umlauff, with a fatalistic mindset, rushed to the "free island behind the Iron Curtain - the British and American occupation zones of Berlin" that the British and American imperialists told him about, and found his long-separated mother. He was happy that his mother was still alive, but he couldn't understand for a while why she lived in the American occupation zone but went to the Soviet zone to work every day...

    He registered his household and also registered for unemployment. His mother gradually told her son how she found a job in the Soviet zone because the factories in the West Zone had closed down, and how in the first two years after the war, the Soviet Union, in the midst of devastation, provided food and materials that it urgently needed to help the German people. Although he initially dared not believe it, unemployment led him to the East Zone and exposed him to everything of a truly democratic system. He went to the East Zone every day to buy newspapers. He found a job, wanted to study, wanted to be a new person, and drive the past nightmares out of his mind. He also wrote letters to other partners who had the same experience, telling them about his ideological transformation.

    Last July was a day that Umlauff would never forget. From that time on, he joined the Free German Youth League. He recalled the scene of the Youth Peace Conference. He said with great emotion: "The youth from the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries came to shake hands with us.

    It made us feel that we have become members of a democratic family."

    At this time, Umlauff returned to the initial impression he gave me, cheerful, energetic, and confident. If it wasn't for the phone urging him, he would have asked about many more things about the new Chinese youth.

　　一个德国兵的故事
    德意志民主共和国访问记之三
    吴文焘
    德国青年和平大会过后的星期天中午，我正坐在招待所里整理笔记，忽然，随着敲门的声音，走进一个没穿制服，只带徽章的自由德国青年联盟的盟员。他说了一声“友谊”，（自由德国青年联盟盟员相互招呼时的用语）就毫不拘束地坐下来。他的表情是愉快而充满着朝气和信心的。他问我要一些关于中国青年运动的材料，说是自由德国青年报要发表。我便乘此机会向他探问西德、西柏林的青年在东区开会回去后的情形，以及是否发生了什么事件。
    “很抱歉！”他说，“我虽然住在西柏林美占区，因为这几天大清早就过来办公，很少机会去打听这些事，只知道西柏林报上登着开会回去的青年，很多人因宣传和平签名而被捕了。”
    他住在美占领区这一点引起了我的注意，因而提出了很多问题问他，从物价到他家庭的穿衣吃饭等。
    他在《青年世界报》编辑部工作，一个月的薪金三百五十个共和国马克（即东马克），除了社会保险及每天中午在公共食堂吃饭扣一百马克外，下余的钱政府特许按一比一兑换百分之六十来支付在西柏林住的房租、灯、火等费用。除了吃，还有百十马克的剩余。他的母亲也在东柏林工作。她天天到东柏林来买日用品，他的崭新西装，就是最近从“哈欧”（民主德国公营商店的缩写）买的。他说：“我比哥哥好多了。哥哥是个残废军人，一只脚，每月薪金一八○西马克，除了保险费及所得税，只剩百十来马克，一个老婆两个孩子，真够苦的。我侥幸，在战时没有残废。”
    “你也当过兵吗？”
    “啊，当过！一九四八年十一月才从美国的俘虏营里被释放回来。”这时，他用手向后摸了摸他那淡黄色的头发，又把黄色阔边眼镜向上推了推，健康而透着粉色的短方面孔有些不自然的表情。稍顷，他年轻而有朝气的声音变得沉重了。他说：
    “如果要我讲怎样从一个希特勒的兵成了一个自由德国青年联盟的盟员，我不能不首先表示我们曾为纳粹利用过的德国人对于苏联及其他被侵害的国家人民的可耻的罪孽。”他停了一下，我点头同意他的意见，请他讲下去。
    他叫葛哈·乌木劳夫，今年二十九岁了。父亲一九三五年就去世，家庭主要靠母亲在柏林一个商店里作工来维持。一九四○年他还在上学，就被征入伍了。由于眼睛近视，他先入空军的通讯班受训，毕业后在希腊、捷克等地的飞机场指挥飞机起落。一九四三年，在捷克北部的工业区奥洛木茨，不管他的眼睛多么坏，也被征入作战部队。他和一群伙伴被派到空运部队。
    斯大林格勒之战以后，他并不了解希特勒的败局已成。可是，他体验到希特勒的党卫军和战地宪兵加紧了恐怖。他原被指定和西班牙的蓝色师团空运到东线去的，但是由于英美军已在法国登陆了，虽然蓝色师团还是调到东线去了，而乌木劳夫和其他临时收集来的散兵游勇另组织了一个师团留在西线。一九四五年二月，他们一个连八十个人配备了一些重武器，受命防守德法边境塔克逊堡附近三公里长的一个阵地。当美军进占了对面的一个艾弗尔小山时，连长下令八十个人在黄昏时把它夺回来。因为美国步兵是怕在夜里作战的，并且没有坦克或装甲车在前面掩护也是不敢打仗的。
    乌木劳夫见我笑了一笑，便接着说：
    “不但步兵，就拿空袭柏林来说，在夜里，美方总是叫英国空军出动，而英国空军自然又不免叫当时参加英国空军的捷克和其他被占领国家的志愿队去担任呢！”
    乌木劳夫就在夺那个山头时被俘了。一个美国军官先把他周身搜了一遍，搜去了一个金怀表，给了他一支美国烟作“报酬”。当乌木劳夫衔着那支烟走过临时拘留所的卫兵的面前时，那卫兵冷不防照鼻子上给了他一巴掌，鼻子流了血，烟也被打掉了。过了一会儿，他被解到集中营去，又经过同一个卫兵，这回，那卫兵一面骂着：“你这希特勒的血腥的私生子”，用劲地踢了他一脚，随手却送给他满满的一包“骆驼牌”香烟。
    我禁不住大笑了，问他美兵为什么这样做。“谁知道呢？”他说，“这大概就是美国的生活方式吧！”
    之后，他和其他的俘虏一起被运到美国去了。他讲述了美国管俘人员如何教他们学习“美国生活方式”的故事。美国的教官们说，德国的“民主化”只有学习“美国生活方式”才是正确的。
    和另外四百多德军俘虏一起，他被送到美国南卡罗来纳州去劳动了，雇主给俘虏营比黑人还要高的工资去雇人，管理人则一人一天只给五角钱，其余就入了自己的腰包。他们和黑人一起做摘棉花和收割等工作。他说：“当时这一帮受过纳粹‘优秀人种’教育的战俘们，对于黑人农夫农妇的被毒打、强奸，当然并不觉得奇怪。他们奇怪的，倒是‘美国之音’高唱入云的所谓‘民主’的‘美国生活方式’竟和纳粹生活方式完全没有分别！”
    一九四八年的春天，乌木劳夫所在的俘虏营里发生骚动了，因为他们听到了一个消息，说美国当局正和英国的资本家磋商出售俘虏。他们一致要求，立即遣送回国。美国军官威吓他们说：“按照波茨坦协定，一切俘虏都可杀头！”终于经过多次斗争，他和一小部分人于一九四八年十一月回到了德国。
    但是，在汉堡下船后，看到了故国的一切，听到了亲友们的讲述，看了官方公布的西德惊人的失业数字，大家的心情立时陷入失望和迷惘里。曾几何时，英美的占领当局又在重组德军，和希特勒一样，高叫消灭布尔什维克了。
    乌木劳夫带着听天由命的思想，冲到英美帝国主义者告诉他的“铁幕后的自由孤岛——柏林英美占区”，找到了久别的妈妈。他高兴妈妈还活着，但一时还不能懂为什么她住在美占领区，而天天到苏区去工作……
    他登记了户口，同时也登记了失业。妈妈渐渐告诉了儿子，她如何因为西区工厂关了门而在苏区找到了工作以及战后头两年苏联如何在河山糜烂的情况下，拿出自己所迫切需要的食粮和物资来救济德国人民。他虽然最初不敢相信，但失业使他走向东区，接触了真正民主制度的一切。他每天到东区去买报，他找到了职业，想学习，想重新作人，把过去的梦魔从头脑里赶走。他并写信告诉其他有同样经历的伙伴们他的思想转变的经过。
    去年七月是乌木劳夫永远不能忘记的日子。从那时，他加入了自由德国青年联盟。他回忆着青年和平大会的情景。十分感慨地说：“苏、中和各人民民主国家的青年来和我们握手。
    使我们感觉到自己已成为民主家庭的一员了。”
    这时乌木劳夫回复到他最初给我的印象，愉快、朝气而有信心。不是电话催他，他还要打听新中国青年的很多事情呢。
