    Letter
    Sent from my distant hometown,
    Written by my twelve-year-old younger brother.

    Second Brother:
    You said in your letter:
    You are in good health in the army.
    Our whole family is very happy!
    Everyone at home is well,
    Father, Mother, Eldest Brother, Sister-in-law
    Go to the fields to produce every day;
    My sister and I go to school every day.
　
    Mother told me:
    The year you joined the army,
    I was only seven years old,
    Our family hadn’t yet been emancipated,
    We were so poor we had nothing to eat or wear!
    Now we have good times
    —We are able to study.
    We must study hard
    To be worthy of you, Second Brother,
    To be worthy of the People's Liberation Army,
    Chairman Mao!
    I listened to my mother,
    And study very hard,
    I got “first place” last year and this year!
    Now I have learned to write letters.
　
    Second Brother,
    There is also good news.
    This year's harvest is really good!
    Our family harvested five *shi* and four of wheat in the summer,
    Six *shi* and five of millet and sorghum in the autumn,
    Two *shi* and eight of rice,
    And large baskets of corn,
    Yams…
    We planted thirteen *mu* of cotton,
    And picked nine hundred *jin* at once,
    The flowers are white and the bolls are big,
    Our whole family is overjoyed!
    We used the surplus grain
    To trade for a big yellow bull;
    And built a new cart.
    Father said,
    He will also make new cotton coats for everyone!
    The situation in our village is almost the same for every family
    —No worries about food or clothing!
    It really seems that good days have arrived,
    But the hateful American devils are invading again!
　
    The district government called on everyone:
    "Oppose the United States' provocation of war,
    Defend world peace!"
    Even the children in our village signed their names!
    Yesterday, the village chief reported again:
    American devils in our Northeast,
    Dropped bombs,
    And strafed with machine guns,
    Everyone who heard it was angry and hateful!
    Every family must use practical actions to oppose the invasion.
    Our family decided to increase our grain tax this year
    By two hundred *jin*!
　
    Father said:
    He and eldest brother are at home,
    You don't need to worry about anything,
    Just hope you take care of your health,
    And wholeheartedly defend the country!

    Letter
    Is a poem singing the praises of the new life!
    Is a protest against the American robbers!
    It leaves me
    The happiest feelings,
    The most courageous fighting will!
    Dear younger brother, father…
    I will definitely not forget!
    I will definitely not forget!
    October 25, 1950, in Qingdao

    信
    从远方的家乡寄来，
    是十二岁小弟弟写的。

    二哥：
    你来信说：
    在部队里身体很好。
    咱全家都很高兴！
    家里大家都好，
    爸爸、妈妈、大哥、嫂嫂
    天天去地里生产；
    我和妹妹天天去上学。
　
    妈妈告诉我：
    你去参军那一年，
    我才七岁，
    家里还没闹翻身，
    穷得没吃没穿！
    现在有了好光景
    ——能够读书。
    要好好用功
    才对得起二哥，
    才对得起解放军、
    毛主席！
    我听了妈妈的话，
    读书挺用功，
    去年、今年都得“第一”！
    现在我已学会了写信。
　
    二哥，
    还有一个好消息。
    今年年成真好！
    咱家夏收麦子五石四，
    秋收小米高粱六石五，
    谷子二石八，
    还有大箩大箩的玉米、
    山药蛋……
    种了十三亩棉花，
    一次就摘了九百斤，
    花又白，朵又大，
    咱全家都乐坏啦！
    我们把多余的粮食
    换来一条大黄牯；
    又打了一辆新车。
    爸爸说，
    还要再给大家做件新棉褂！
    咱村家家光景都差不多
    ——不愁吃、不愁穿！
    真是眼看好日子到啦，
    可恨美国鬼子又来侵略！
　
    区政府号召大家：
    “反对美国挑拨战争，
    保卫世界和平！”
    咱村连娃儿都签了名！
    昨天村长又报告说：
    美国鬼子在咱们东北，
    丢了炸弹，
    又扫机关枪，
    人人听了又气又恨！
    家家要用实际行动反对侵略。
    咱家决定今年要加缴公粮
    二百斤！
　
    爸爸说：
    家里有他，有大哥，
    一切不用你记挂，
    只希望你保重身体，
    一心一意保卫国家！

    是歌唱新生活的诗！
    是反对美国强盗的抗议书！
    它留给我
    最幸福的感情，
    最勇敢的战斗意志！
    亲爱的小弟弟、父亲……
    我一定不会忘记！
    我一定不会忘记！
