　　General Administration of Customs Displays High Enthusiasm for Resisting America and Aiding Korea
　　Overtime, Donations, Making Comfort Bags, and Writing Letters of Condolence Form a Surge Within the Administration
　　[Report from this newspaper] In the past two weeks, the movement to resist America and aid Korea has been launched enthusiastically within the General Administration of Customs. The number of comrades who signed up to work in the Northeast exceeded half of the administration's staff, but only fourteen were approved. Many comrades who signed up but were not approved expressed their willingness to work harder in their current positions after explanations. In the Smuggling Investigation Department, two people went to the Northeast, and the comrades in the entire department took over the work of the two who left without waiting for administrative instructions. They said, "If the work cannot be finished, we can do extra work. We must guarantee the completion of the task." Technician Zhou Boyu guaranteed that the lights in the entire administration would not have any problems. Xu Dingchen from the cooperative guaranteed that he would send grain on time to the families of comrades who went to work in the Northeast. Lin Daqi, the director of the Statistics Department, who is currently ill, wrote a letter to the secretary of the Party branch, deeply regretting that he could not go to the front line due to illness, and donated all of his savings of three hundred and thirty-five US dollars. Youth League members Feng Chengqiu and Chen Mingchun are willing to contribute a quarter of their monthly salaries to support the Korean people until the American imperialists are driven out. Since the news of the Korean People's Army achieving significant victories with the assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea, the comfort movement has been widely launched. Worker Lei Mingchun made ten comfort bags by himself and also donated fifty catties of millet. A group in the Secretariat made forty-two comfort bags. Many comrades buried themselves in writing letters of condolence during their evenings and spare time. Everyone hopes to send the comfort goods to the front lines as soon as possible. This high degree of patriotism and internationalism fully demonstrates how firm the Chinese people's will to defend world peace and oppose American aggression is.

　　海关总署抗美援朝情绪高涨
    署内加班、捐献、做慰劳袋、写慰问信形成热潮
    【本报讯】近两周来，抗美援朝运动在海关总署内热烈展开，报名赴东北工作的同志超过全署工作人员的半数，只批准了十四人。许多报了名而没有被批准的同志，经解释后表示愿意在本岗位上加倍努力工作。查私处有两个人到东北去，全处同志未等行政指示，便把走了的两人的工作包了下来，他们说：“如工作做不完，我们可以加工来做，我们一定要保证完成任务。”技工周伯瑜保证全署电灯不出毛病。合作社徐鼎臣保证按期送粮食给赴东北工作同志的眷属。正在病中的统计处处长林大琪，写信给党支部书记，深以病中不能到战地去为憾，特将全部储蓄三百三十五美元全部捐献了出来。青年团员冯承秋、陈明纯二人愿从本薪中按月提出四分之一支援朝鲜人民，直至美帝国主义被赶走为止。自朝鲜人民军在中国人民援朝志愿部队援助下获得重大胜利的消息传来后，慰劳运动已普遍展开。工友雷鸣春一个人就做了十个慰劳袋，另外还捐献了五十斤小米，秘书科一个小组做了四十二个慰劳袋，许多同志利用晚上业余时间埋头写慰劳信，大家都希望早日把慰劳品寄到前方去。这种高度的爱国主义和国际主义精神，充分说明了中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略的意志是如何坚决。
