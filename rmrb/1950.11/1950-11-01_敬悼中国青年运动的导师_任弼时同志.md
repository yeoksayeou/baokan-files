　　In Deepest Grief, Remembering Comrade Ren Bishi, Mentor of the Chinese Youth Movement
　　Jiang Nanxiang
　　The sudden passing of Comrade Ren Bishi is an extremely grave loss for the entire Party and the cause of the Chinese people's revolution. From the perspective of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and the Chinese youth movement, we feel this loss even more profoundly and irremediably.
　　Comrade Bishi's contribution to the youth movement is merely a small part of his glorious revolutionary career. However, the long and close relationship between Comrade Bishi and the Chinese youth movement is like a red thread running through his entire revolutionary life.
　　In my own experience, my most profound impressions of Comrade Bishi's concern and wise leadership of the youth movement are two things: one is his emphasis on developing the youth movement in the Northeast; the other is his leadership of the work of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League.
　　In September 1945, after the Japanese aggressors had unconditionally surrendered, Comrade Bishi summoned several comrades from our Central Youth Work Committee to talk with him and gave the following instructions: "The youth of the Northeast have been under the rule of the puppet Manchuria for fourteen years. They have a strong patriotic heart, but they have not had the opportunity to come into contact with the outside world. Like people in a dark room suddenly running into the sunlight, it is not easy for them to recognize their direction for a while. Therefore, we urgently need to go to the Northeast to unite and educate the youth of the Northeast and raise their revolutionary consciousness. The Northeast is a very important place, and the victory of the revolution in the Northeast will accelerate the process of the victory of the Chinese revolution." According to this instruction from Comrade Bishi, Comrade Song Yiping and I led a youth work team of more than ninety people, starting on foot from Yan'an, crossing the Yellow River, crossing the enemy's blockade line on the Tongpu Railway, crossing the ancient Great Wall, and after more than three months of trekking along the way, entered the Northeast, which was covered in ice and snow and permeated with a fierce struggle atmosphere. According to the spirit of Comrade Bishi's instructions in Yan'an, the Northeast Democratic Youth League was established in Harbin in August 1946. This was the earliest revolutionary youth organization established in the Northeast after "August 15th." This organization was later transformed into the New Democratic Youth League in the Northeast. Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau, after three years of arduous and tortuous struggle, the Northeast People's Liberation Army finally completely eliminated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army directly supported by the American imperialists, captured alive many senior generals directly trained by the American imperialists, and liberated the entire Northeast. In the course of these three years of the Liberation War, the youth of the Northeast, under the leadership and promotion of the Northeast Democratic Youth League and the New Democratic Youth League, quickly broke the blind orthodox concepts, warmly supported the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and did a lot of work in intensifying production, supporting the front lines, and participating in the takeover of newly liberated cities, becoming a faithful assistant to the Party and the People's Government. Comrade Bishi's initial wise instructions for the Northeast youth movement have been fully confirmed by historical practice.
　　In the process of Comrade Bishi's guidance of the work of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, his loyalty to the revolutionary cause, his conscientious responsibility for his work, and his patient persuasion of young comrades, deeply moved us and can never be forgotten.
　　Comrade Bishi was the main advocate for the establishment of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. He believed that in the situation of the victorious development of the revolution, it was very necessary to establish a mass organization of advanced youth such as the New Democratic Youth League. At the same time, he also knew that under the current situation in China, it would be very difficult to overcome various difficulties and establish a national youth league. Therefore, he personally served as the chairman of the preparatory committee to lead and promote the founding of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. When the First National Congress of the New Democratic Youth League was held in Beijing last year (1949) in April, Comrade Bishi's health was already very bad, but he refused to rest and still participated in several important discussions of the preparatory meeting despite his illness, reviewed and revised the main documents for the congress, and especially attended the congress to make a political report, formulating the general policy for the work of the New Democratic Youth League. When he made a political report to the Youth League Congress, he did not have the strength to finish reading his long report, but only read half of it, and the other half was read by another comrade on his behalf. Because of his overwork during the Youth League Congress, he had to stop working and take complete rest after the Youth League Congress was over.
　　During his recuperation, we visited him several times to inquire about his condition. He always inquired about the work of the League with great concern. Although the doctor instructed him not to speak for more than ten minutes, he often talked enthusiastically, forgetting this limit himself. This April, when he returned from Moscow after recuperating, we went to his residence to see him. When he heard that the League's organization had greatly developed and that the League's role in various works was becoming increasingly significant, he revealed an expression of gratification, which made us deeply feel: how concerned he was about the development of the youth movement, and how enthusiastically he cared about the growth of the Youth League! This July, Comrade Bishi officially started part of his work, and he first put the guidance of the Youth League's work on his work agenda. At that time, we heard that Comrade Bishi's health had greatly improved, and at the same time, the Youth League's work could get more of his guidance, and we would have more opportunities to listen to his education. Everyone was very happy. Unexpectedly, less than four months after resuming work, he suddenly died of a cerebral hemorrhage.
　　Comrade Bishi's death was undoubtedly due to overwork during this period. Originally, the doctor only allowed him to work for four hours a day, but in fact, he did far more than four hours of work, and often worked non-stop all day long. Originally, he was scheduled to rest once in September, but he did not rest. His selfless Bolshevik quality of only remembering work and not remembering his own body is most clearly manifested here.
　　Our beloved Comrade Bishi has passed away, but with his heroic and struggling life, he has left us a glorious example of a great Chinese people's warrior. The youth of the whole country and all Youth League members should inherit Comrade Bishi's legacy, learn from Comrade Bishi's example, work hard under the banner of the great leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, and contribute all their strength to defending the motherland, consolidating and developing the victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary cause.
　　Rest in peace, Comrade Bishi. Your spirit and cause are immortal.

　　敬悼中国青年运动的导师——任弼时同志
    蒋南翔
    任弼时同志的突然逝世，这是整个党和中国人民革命事业的极严重损失。从中国新民主主义青年团和中国青年运动这一方面说，我们更深切地感到这个损失的沉重和无法补偿。
    在中国青年运动方面的贡献，仅仅是弼时同志光辉的革命事业的一小部分。但弼时同志和中国青年运动的悠久而密切的关系，是像一缕红线似的贯串着他整个的革命生涯。
    弼时同志对于青年运动的关心和英明领导，在我自己的体验中，印象最深刻的有两件事情。一件是他对于开展东北青年运动的重视；一件是他的领导中国新民主主义青年团的工作。
    在一九四五年九月，日本侵略者已经无条件投降，弼时同志召集我们中央青年工作委员会的几位同志到他那里去谈话，作了这样的指示：“东北青年在伪满统治下十四年，他们有强烈的爱国心，但过去没有机会接触外面的世界，像黑屋子里的人骤然跑到阳光下面，一时不容易认清自己的方向，因此我们很迫切地需要到东北去做团结和教育东北青年的工作，提高他们的革命觉悟。东北的地方很重要，东北革命的胜利将会加速中国革命胜利的过程。”根据弼时同志的这一指示，我和宋一平同志等一同率领了一支包括九十多人的青年工作队，从延安徒步出发，越过黄河，越过同蒲路上敌人的封锁线，越过古老的万里长城，沿途经过了三个多月的跋涉，进入了冰天雪地和弥漫着剧烈斗争空气的东北。根据弼时同志在延安所指示的精神，哈尔滨于一九四六年八月即开始建立了东北民主青年联盟，这是“八一五”以后在东北最早建立起来的革命青年组织，这个组织以后就转化东北地区的新民主主义青年团。在党的中央和东北局的正确领导下，经过三年艰苦曲折的斗争，东北人民解放军终于全部消灭了美帝国主义者直接支援下的蒋介石匪军，活捉了美帝国主义所直接训练的许多高级将领，解放了全部东北。在这三年解放战争的过程中，东北青年先后在东北民主青年联盟和新民主主义青年团的领导和推动下，很快地打破了盲目正统观念，热烈地拥护共产党和毛主席，他们在加紧生产、支援前线、参加接管初解放城市等各种工作中，做了许多工作，成为党和人民政府的一个忠实助手。弼时同志最初对于东北青年运动的英明指示，为历史的实践所完全证实。
    弼时同志在指导中国新民主主义青年团的工作过程中，他那种对于革命事业的忠心耿耿，对于工作的认真负责，对于青年同志的循循善诱，实在使我们深深地感动，永远不能忘记。
    弼时同志是建立中国新民主主义青年团的主要倡导者，他认为在革命胜利发展的形势下，建立新民主主义青年团这样一种先进青年的群众性组织，非常必要，同时他又知道在中国目前的情况下，要克服各种困难，建立一个全国性的青年团，这件事情很不容易，所以他亲自担任了筹备委员会主任，来领导和推动中国新民主主义青年团的创办工作。去年（一九四九）四月在北京召开新民主主义青年团全国第一次代表大会时，弼时同志的健康状况已经很不好，但他不肯休息，仍还抱病参加筹备会的几次重要讨论，为大会审阅和修改主要的文件，特别是亲自出席向大会做了政治报告，给新民主主义青年团的工作制定了总的方针。他在向团代表大会作政治报告时，已经没有气力把自己的长篇报告宣读完毕，而是只读了一半，其余的一半由另外的同志代他读完。因为他在团代表大会期间工作的过度疲劳，因此他在团代表大会开过以后，就不得不停止工作，完全休养了。
    他在休养期间，我们曾有几次去探访他的病况，他总是很关心地询问着团的工作情况，虽然医生嘱咐他讲话不要超过十分钟，但他常常热心地谈着，自己忘记了这种限度。今年四月，他从莫斯科养病回来，我们到他的寓所去看他，他听说团的组织已经有了很大发展，团在各种工作当中所起的作用也日益显著的时候，他流露着一种欣慰的表情，使我们深深感到：他是怎样关心着青年运动的发展，怎样满腔热忱地在关怀着青年团的成长！今年七月，弼时同志正式开始一部分工作，他首先就是把指导青年团的工作，放在自己的工作日程上。当时我们听到弼时同志的健康状况很有好转，同时青年团的工作可以更多地得到他的指导，我们将有更多机会聆受他的教育，大家都很高兴。想不到恢复工作不到四个月，他竟突然患脑出血病而逝世了。
    弼时同志的致死，这一时期来的过度工作，无疑是重要原因之一。本来医生只允许他每天做四小时工作，但实际上他所做的工作要远远超过四小时，甚至常常是整天不停地工作。本来他预定要在九月休息一次，但他没有休息。他这种只记得工作，不记得自己身体的忘我的布尔塞维克品质，在这里是表现得再明显也没有了。
    我们敬爱的弼时同志与世长辞了，但是他以自己英勇奋斗的一生，给我们留下了一个伟大的中国人民战士的光辉典范。全国青年和全体青年团员，都应很好地继承弼时同志的遗志，学习弼时同志的榜样，在中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东的旗帜之下，努力工作，为保卫祖国、巩固和发展中国人民革命事业的胜利而贡献出自己的全部力量。
    安息吧，弼时同志。你的精神和事业是永远不朽的。
