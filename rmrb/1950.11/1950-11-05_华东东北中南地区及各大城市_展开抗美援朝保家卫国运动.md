East China, Northeast China, Central and South China, and major cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin have launched activities to resist US aggression, aid Korea, and defend the nation. The people of various regions have expressed extreme anger at the US imperialists' insane massacre of the Korean people, their expansion of the war of aggression, their armed invasion of our Taiwan Province, and their repeated violations of our airspace and territorial waters, killing and injuring our compatriots. They are willing to stand with the Korean people to resist the American aggressors.

Democratic Parties and People's Organizations
Issue Statements to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea

Democratic parties and people's organizations in various regions have successively issued statements to resist US aggression, aid Korea, and defend the nation. The bandit-like behavior of US planes invading the coastal areas of Shandong has further aroused the Shandong people's new and old hatred for US imperialism. The Shandong Provincial People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, the Shandong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's Federation, the Youth Federation, the Student Federation, the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Jinan Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and other people's organizations have issued statements, unanimously stating that the people of Shandong will contribute all their strength to defend the country's territorial sovereignty and world peace. The protest letter from the Third Session of the Qingdao People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee pointed out: The people of Qingdao still have vivid memories of the past aggression against Korea and China by Japanese imperialism, as well as the bloody history of US imperialism's exploitation of the Qingdao people before liberation. We will strengthen unity and organize ourselves to fight to the end against the new aggression of US imperialism. The preparatory committee of the Shanghai branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang stated in its statement: No matter how ferocious the face of US imperialism may be, it will never frighten us. We have the confidence to extinguish this evil war of aggression. The Shanghai Working Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the Shanghai Branch of the China Democratic League, the Shanghai Provisional Working Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, the Shanghai Branch of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Shanghai Branch of the Jiusan Society, the headquarters of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, and other groups have issued statements, unanimously stating: If the American aggressors continue to be insane, they will be met with a relentless counterattack from the 475 million Chinese people and bring about their own destruction. The Second First People's Representative Conference currently being held in Nanjing issued a telegram, resolutely stating: In order to defend the sacred motherland and world peace, we will not hesitate to pay any price. The Central and South China Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's Federation, and other groups have also issued protest letters against US imperialism's aggression. The preparatory committee of the Central and South China Federation of Trade Unions also called on the three million workers in the region to launch a patriotic production competition, actively support the struggle of the Korean people, and fight to defeat the American bandits. The Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions issued a letter to all workers in the city, calling on the 400,000 workers in the city to mobilize, step up production, and support the Korean people with practical actions to defend the security of the motherland. Luo Yun, director of the Tianjin Women's Federation, on behalf of the 800,000 women in the city, strongly protested against the extremely vicious and crazy acts of aggression by US imperialism. Meng Qiujiang, the person in charge of the Provisional Working Committee of the Tianjin Branch of the China Democratic League, said: US imperialism's aggression against Korea and Taiwan threatens peace in Asia, threatens China's security, and also threatens world peace. Therefore, defending peace is the sacred responsibility of the Chinese people. Premier Zhou's statement that "The Chinese people love peace, but for the sake of peace, they have never been and will never be afraid of resisting wars of aggression" has become the will of the Chinese people to defend peace.

Heroes and Models Express Extreme Anger
Resolutely Oppose US Imperialist Aggression

China's outstanding sons and daughters, and heroes and models from various regions, have expressed extreme hatred for the aggressive crimes of US imperialism. Wang Fenglou, a labor model representative and construction hero in the Central and South China region, said: Once the country needs it, I will resolutely take up arms to fight against the American aggressors. The 246 heroic and model representatives of the Jiangxi Military Region, who are attending the All-Region Hero and Model Representative Conference, unanimously stated: We are determined to build a strong national defense force and establish the idea of always being a fighting team to crush the aggressive schemes of US imperialism. Zhang Shibao, a famous emergency repair hero of the Shanghai Power Company, said excitedly: On February 6 this year, many dear comrades were bombed into pieces of flesh by US planes. To this day, our blood feud has not been avenged, and the bloody claws of US imperialism have stretched out again! I am willing to stand on the front line where I am most needed, support the Korean people, and avenge the workers who died. Labor models in the Northeast and Tianjin have also expressed their opinions against US imperialism's aggression and expressed their determination to resist US aggression and defend the country.

People from All Walks of Life, Including Workers, Peasants, and Students
Want to Take Action to Strike at US Imperialism

Workers, peasants, students, honorary soldiers, and families of soldiers in various parts of the Northeast, who are most threatened by US imperialist wars of aggression, have expressed their determination to help the Korean people and defend their homes and country with practical actions. At an emergency rally against American bombing in Shenyang, many workers clenched their fists and shouted: "Look! We Chinese people will cut off the bloody claws of aggression of American imperialism!" Zang Yingfu, a railway worker in Harbin, said angrily at the anti-American aggression rally: "Korea is our neighbor, and helping them is helping ourselves." Xu Ting, a farmer in Zhen'an District, Andong Town, said: "I have long seen through the minds of the American devils. If it really dares to come, we Chinese people will definitely beat it until it has no armor left!" After discussing the atrocities of US imperialism in Korea, Yu Jiuxi, a member of the Youth League at Dalian No. 2 Junior High School, said: "We must help our Korean friends. If necessary, I will put down my pen and pick up a gun." Yu Qingzhou, an honorary soldier from Zhongshan District in the city, said firmly after hearing the news that the US invading army was approaching our border: "I want to go to the front line again to kill the enemy for the country!" Song Chuanyi, a model soldier's family member in Andong City, who had been repeatedly bombed and strafed by US planes, said: "During the Liberation War, I already dedicated my son to the country. Now, if the American devils come again, I will come out myself to fight them to the death." All the workers of the No. 1 Clothing Factory of the Logistics Department of the East China Military Region deeply hated the aggressive behavior of US imperialism, and they gave up their Sunday holidays and worked two extra night shifts to ensure the timely completion of the troops' cotton clothing tasks. Farmers in Zhenru District, Shanghai suburbs, have completed the autumn harvest and autumn plowing and are preparing to welcome the glorious task of grain requisition. More than 50 students from Jiaotong University, Fudan University, Daozhong Girls' High School, Guanghua University Affiliated High School, and Jingye Middle School jointly stated: We are willing to dedicate everything to defend the motherland and world peace. People in northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu and other regions also angrily expressed their determination to resolutely resist US imperialist aggression. Transport and dyeing workers in northern Anhui said: The Chinese people have defeated the aggression of Japanese imperialism and overthrown the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Now that the workers are liberated, if the US imperialists come to invade us again, we will resolutely fight them. A driver from the Yangzhou Town Automobile Company in northern Jiangsu said angrily: "If the US imperialists dare to invade, I am determined to take up a gun and go to the front line to defend the country. Workers, women, and people in the business community in Guangzhou have also expressed their firm will. All the employees of the Guangdong Paper Mill held a meeting on October 31, at which they expressed their determination to resolutely resist US imperialist aggression and support the Korean people. Shen Yumin, a female doctor at the Guangzhou Maternity and Child Health Hospital, said: "I work hard for the health and happy future of women and children, but the American bandits are trying to destroy women and children with war, but I am not afraid at all, and I am always ready to contribute everything I have to the struggle against aggression and in defense of the motherland."
