　　Beijing Middle School Teachers, Students, and Staff
    Love the Motherland and Oppose American Imperialist Aggression
    Expressing They Can No Longer Tolerate It and Are Ready to Take Immediate Action
    [Our Newspaper] American imperialism is frantically expanding its war of aggression, causing extreme indignation in Beijing's middle schools. Beijing Municipal No. 1 Middle School, No. 4 Middle School, No. 6 Middle School, No. 7 Middle School, No. 8 Middle School, Girls' No. 1 Middle School, Girls' No. 3 Middle School, Hebei High School, Affiliated High School of Beijing Normal University, Affiliated Girls' High School of Beijing Normal University, Municipal Normal School, Hebei Provincial Normal School, Mongolian-Tibetan School, Yiwenzhong School, Xinsheng Middle School, Wanzizhong School, Muzhen Girls' School, Duzhi Girls' School, Chongci Girls' School, Huiwen Middle School, Yuying Middle School, Yude Middle School, and Hongda Middle School, among others, have universally launched a patriotic upsurge against American imperialist aggression.
    The walls, trees, and specially erected billboards of various schools are covered with all kinds of wall newspapers, big-character posters, and large pictorials and maps centered on opposing American imperialist aggression. Teachers, students, and staff of various schools launched current affairs discussions in various ways, indignantly expressing their opinions on the current situation. Some schools also held rallies to denounce the atrocities of American imperialism.

    Teachers, Students, and Staff Gathered
    To Denounce the Atrocities of American Imperialist Aggression
    The Student Union and Labor Union of Hebei High School jointly convened a school-wide "Teachers, Students, and Staff Anti-American Aggression Rally" on October 28th. Forty-seven representatives from thirty-eight units, including the China Youth Society, Beijing People's Radio, and Beijing universities and middle schools, attended and participated. The participants spoke enthusiastically, expressing their utter hatred for the aggressive crimes of American imperialism and their determination to wage a life-and-death struggle against American imperialism. Physics teacher Geng Keren also explained at the meeting that American weapons are not terrible, and that the outcome of war is determined not by weapons but by human truth. Guests wrote many opinions and thoughts in the guestbook, unanimously expressing their intention to bring this upsurge against American aggression back to their respective schools.
    Teachers and students of No. 8 Middle School held separate denunciation meetings on October 27th. At the "Resist America and Denounce" rally convened by the school's labor union, Zhou Shuzhi said: "I grew up in the Northeast, and I am familiar with the vicious methods of the Japanese. The Japanese found that Chinese people ate rice, so they put them in sacks and beat them to death or had them bitten to death by wolves. In schools, they carried out enslavement education. I know that imperialism is all the same. We must never be enslaved by imperialism again. So now I am willing to unconditionally obey the organization's arrangements and resolutely smash the American imperialist conspiracy of aggression." Principal Zhu concluded by saying: "The frenzy of American imperialism will not last long. American imperialism has great shortcomings in its front lines, supplies, and morale. It just has some stinking money. Moreover, we already have a powerful army with new weapons and the unified support of the people of the whole country. The failure of imperialism is inevitable. But today, some people still have more or less 'fear of America.' I hope everyone will do more publicity to relatives, friends, and neighbors, and lead students to do a good job in publicity." After Principal Zhu finished speaking, all the teachers requested to take an oath. In a solemn atmosphere, facing the portrait of Chairman Mao, everyone raised their right hands and swore: "We are determined to love our motherland, determined to follow the Communist Party; we vow to oppose imperialism to the death and prepare to unconditionally dedicate everything we have!"
    The Labor Union and Student Union of Yude Middle School jointly convened a rally to denounce the crimes of American imperialism on the afternoon of the 1st. More than 1,400 teachers, staff, and students attended. Li Yuming, a fifteen-year-old girl, tearfully recounted the tragic death of her father, who was bombed to death by American imperialism. Li Kuaifa, an overseas Chinese student from Nanyang, recounted in a somber and impassioned tone the persecution he personally suffered from Japanese imperialism, British imperialism, and American imperialism in Malaya, pointing out that the brutality and shamelessness of the imperialists are the same. Principal Zhang Xun called for the complete elimination of illusions about and fear of American imperialism, the consolidation of anti-American sentiment, and its expansion to every surrounding mass. The meeting passed a letter to Chairman Mao and General Kim Il-sung, expressing their sincere support for Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and vowing to be the bulwark of the Korean people.

    For the Security of the Motherland and World Peace
    Prepare to Contribute Everything Unconditionally
    "For the security of the motherland and world peace, we are prepared to contribute everything unconditionally" has become the common call and unanimous determination of teachers and students in various schools. They all want to learn from Paul Korchagin, Guo Junqing, and other great patriotic heroes of China and the Soviet Union and become heroic warriors in resisting America and aiding Korea to defend the motherland. Twenty-three students in Class 2, Grade 1 of Girls' No. 3 Middle School spontaneously organized an "Oleg Combat Team" to learn from the example of Oleg, a young hero in the Soviet-German War. They took an oath before the portrait of Chairman Mao, the national flag, and the Party flag on the 30th. On the 31st, they wrote a letter to Chairman Mao saying: Chairman Mao, you understand the feelings of Chinese youth: Chinese youth will never be engineers or writers under bayonets... We will never be prisoners of difficulties. One day when the motherland needs young students, we will be the first to shoulder this glorious and great task.

    Teachers and Students Together
    Enthusiastically Conduct Patriotic Propaganda
    Beijing's middle school teachers and school administrations also demonstrated a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, joined the upsurge against American imperialist aggression, and played an active leading and promoting role.
    All the teachers of Hebei High School held a forum on the afternoon of the 23rd and held an anti-American aggression rally with all the school's students and staff on the afternoon of the 28th. Two geography teachers at the school rushed to produce a large "Current International Situation Map" on the night of the 24th, which greatly helped teachers, students, and staff in studying current affairs. All members of the No. 8 Middle School Labor Union convened a "Resist America and Denounce Rally" and studied day and night documents such as "History of American Imperialist Aggression Against China" and "Handbook of American Imperialist Aggression Against Korea and Taiwan" as propaganda materials.
    Municipal No. 4 Middle School convened a temporary school affairs meeting, and teachers of all subjects decided to urgently cooperate with the development of current affairs and conduct ideological education. In addition to launching enthusiastic discussions and publishing big-character posters, the teachers of Hebei Provincial Beijing Normal School also equipped teaching materials and conducted patriotic education.
    The faculty and staff of the usually calmer Beijing Municipal Normal School also posted big-character posters. Mr. Xie, who taught labor class, said: "I want to use visual art to expose the conspiracy of American imperialism." Mr. Li, who taught art class, even led students to draw cartoons late at night. Large political maps and cartoons of the two major camps of China, Korea, and the world were posted all over the courtyard. The school administration subscribed to a newspaper for each class, and the library of Hebei Provincial Normal School purchased a large number of books and periodicals related to current affairs as reference materials for discussions.

    On the other hand, the enthusiasm of the students also inspired the fighting spirit of the teachers. At the anti-American denunciation rally held by the No. 8 Middle School Labor Union, Mr. Chen Ying said: "I am very happy to see that the students have such enthusiasm. I think this is our strength. Although I am old, I want to compare myself with the youngsters. I will never lag behind in any work!" At the "Teachers, Students, and Staff Anti-American Aggression Rally" at Hebei High School, chemistry teacher Wu Yongxing excitedly said: "Today I saw the great fighting spirit of the youth educated by Mao Zedong. I guarantee that in future teaching I will closely combine with the needs of the country. If needed, I am prepared to accept all new tasks. Although I am middle-aged, I cannot fall behind the youth!"

    Cannot Sit Back and Watch the Neighbor's House on Fire
    Quickly Extinguish the Flames of Aggression
    When discussing the attitude that should be taken towards American imperialist aggression against Korea, everyone believes that it cannot be ignored. Fan Jingliang, a student at the Affiliated High School of Beijing Normal University, said: "Can we watch our neighbor's house on fire and let the fire spread to our own house? No, we must not! We must mobilize and rescue the fire!"
    At a forum for staff members of Municipal No. 6 Middle School, everyone unanimously agreed that the Korean issue is an issue of two lines between the two major camps in the entire world, namely the peace line of the peaceful and democratic camp and the war line of the imperialist aggression camp. Since we are standing on the side of the peaceful and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, and China and Korea are interdependent, of course we cannot ignore the Korean issue.
    During the discussion at Girls' No. 1 Middle School, one student said: "We must now support the Korean people spiritually. We will intervene when American imperialism invades our motherland." Before she could sit down, someone stood up and said angrily: No, when will it be considered an invasion of our motherland?! American planes have already bombed our territory dozens of times, and the American navy has already occupied our territory of Taiwan. How can we still ignore it?! In this way, through these discussions, the opinions of teachers and students became consistent.

    Now the teachers and students of Beijing middle schools can no longer tolerate the aggressive behavior of American imperialism. They are filled with anger and express that they must take action immediately. Gao Yuanming, a student at Beijing Normal High School, said: "American imperialism won't let us study properly, so we must stand up and fight it!" The art group of Hebei Provincial Normal School rushed to produce many cartoons, and the entertainment group led the classes to compose new lyrics, preparing to conduct propaganda to the general public. The students of Huiwen Middle School have recently been stepping up their physical exercise, and many students who did not like to attend physical education class are now moving. During physical education, Class 4 of Junior Grade 3 of Girls' No. 1 Middle School also practiced carrying stretchers. Some even proposed strengthening fire prevention and anti-special forces and requested to join the army.

　　京市各中学师生员工
    热爱祖国反对美帝侵略
    纷纷表示忍无可忍准备立即行动起来
    【本报讯】美帝疯狂扩大侵略战争，在京市各中学中，引起了极大的愤慨。北京市立一中、四中、六中、七中、八中、女一中、女三中和河北高中、师大附中、师大女附中、市立师范学校、河北省师、蒙藏学校、艺文中学、新生中学、万字中学、慕贞女中、笃志女中、崇慈女中、汇文中学、育英中学、育德中学、弘达中学等校，普遍掀起了反对美帝侵略的爱国热潮。
    各个学校的墙上、树上以及特地竖立起来的板牌上，都贴满了各色各样以反对美帝侵略为中心的壁报、大字报和大型的画报、地图。各校师生工友以各种方式展开了时事讨论，愤慨地发表了自己对目前时局的意见。有的学校还举行了控诉美帝暴行大会。
    师生职工纷纷集会
    控诉美帝侵略暴行
    河北高中学生会和工会联合在十月二十八日召开了全校“师生工反美侵略大会”。并有中国青年社、北京人民电台和京市大中学校等三十八个单位的四十七位代表出席参加。与会者踊跃发言，表示了对美帝侵略罪行的切齿痛恨和坚决与美帝做生死斗争的决心。物理教员耿克仁还在会上说明了美国武器并不可怕，决定战争胜负的不是武器而是人类的真理。来宾在留言簿上写下了不少意见和感想，一致表示要把这反对美国侵略的热潮带回各个学校去。
    八中师生在十月二十七日分别举行了控诉会。该校工会召开的“抗美控诉大会”上，周淑芝说：“过去我在东北长大，我对日本的毒辣手段，是熟习的。日本人发现中国老百姓吃大米，就把他们装在麻袋里活活摔死，或叫狼狗咬死。在学校里，则进行奴化教育。我知道帝国主义都是一样。我们决不能再受帝国主义的奴役。所以我现在愿意无条件听从组织分配，坚决粉碎美帝侵略阴谋。”朱校长最后致词说：“美帝疯狂是不会长久的。美帝在战线上，补给上，士气上都有很大缺点，它只是有点臭钱。何况我们已有一支强大的拥有新式武器的军队和全国人民团结一致的支援。帝国主义的失败是必然的。但是今天在一部分人思想上还或多或少地有‘恐美病’，希望大家对亲戚朋友邻居多多宣传，并领导同学作好宣传工作。”朱校长讲完话后，全体教师要求宣誓。在庄重严肃的气氛中，面向毛主席像，全体高举右手，宣誓说：“我们坚决爱护祖国，坚决跟着共产党走；我们誓死反对帝国主义，准备无条件地献出我的一切！”
    育德中学工会和学生会在一日下午联合召开了控诉美帝罪行大会。出席教师员工学生一千四百余人。十五岁的小姑娘李玉明哭着叙述了她父亲惨遭美帝炸死的经过。南洋华侨学生李快发以沉痛激昂的声调述说了他在马来亚亲身受到日帝、英帝、美帝迫害的情况，指出：帝国主义者的残暴无耻是异曲同工的。张迅校长号召彻底肃清对美帝的幻想和惧怕心理，巩固仇美情绪，并扩大到每一个周围的群众中去。会上通过上书毛主席、金日成将军，表示竭诚拥护周外长声明，誓作朝鲜人民的后盾。
    为了祖国安全世界和平
    准备无条件地贡献一切
    “为了祖国安全和世界和平，我们准备无条件地贡献一切”，已成了各校师生共同的呼声和一致的决心。都想学习保尔·柯察金、郭俊卿等这些中苏两国伟大的爱国英雄人物，成为抗美援朝保家卫国的英勇战士。女三中高一乙有二十三个同学自动组织了一个“奥利格战斗队”，要学习苏德战争中青年英雄奥利格的榜样。她们三十日在毛主席像、国旗和党旗面前宣了誓。三十一日写信给毛主席说：毛主席，您是了解中国青年的心情的：中国青年决不做刺刀下的工程师、文学家，……我们更不做困难的俘虏。有一天祖国需要青年学生时，我们将首先担负起这光荣而伟大的任务。
    教师和同学们一起
    热烈进行爱国宣传
    京市中学教师们和学校行政方面，也和同学们一起，发挥了高度爱国热情，卷入反对美帝侵略的热潮中，并起了积极的领导和推动作用。
    河北高中全校老师曾在二十三日下午举行了座谈会，二十八日下午和全校学生工友一起，举行了反美侵略大会。该校两位地理先生在二十四日连夜赶制了大幅“目前国际形势图”，给先生、同学、工友学习时事以很大帮助。八中工会全体会员召开了“抗美控诉大会”，并且日以继夜地学习了“美帝侵华史”和“美帝侵略朝鲜台湾手册”等文件，作为宣传资料。
    市立四中召开了临时校务会议，各科教师都决定紧急配合时事的发展，进行思想教育。河北省立北京师范学校的先生们除展开热烈讨论，出版了大字报等外，并配备教材，进行爱国教育。
    一向比较沉静的北京市立师范学校的教职员们，也贴出了大字报。上劳作课的谢先生说：“我要用形象艺术，把美帝阴谋揭露。”上美术课的李先生甚至在深夜里，还领导同学画漫画。把中朝和世界两大阵营的大政治地图、漫画，贴满了院落。该校行政方面给每班订了一份报纸，河北省师图书馆新购置了大批有关时事的图书刊物，作为讨论时的参考材料。
    另一方面，同学们的热情，也鼓舞了教师们的战斗情绪。八中工会举行的抗美控诉大会上，陈英先生说：“看见同学们有这样的热情，我很感到高兴。我觉得这就是我们的力量。我虽然年纪大了，但我要跟小伴子们比一比。不论什么工作决不后人！”河北高中“师生工反美侵略大会”上，化学教员武永兴激动地说：“我今天看见了毛泽东教育下的青年的伟大战斗精神。我保证在今后教学中将密切结合国家需要。如果需要的话，我准备接受一切新的任务。我虽然是个中年人了，但也不能落在青年们的后边！”
    不能坐视邻舍着火
    赶紧扑灭侵略凶焰
    在讨论美帝侵朝应采取的态度时，都认为不能不理。师大附中范靖亮同学说：“难道我们能看着我们的邻舍家着火，让火延烧到自己的房上来吗？不，决不能这样！我们要动员起来，抢救火灾！”
    市立六中职员座谈会上，大家一致认为：朝鲜问题是整个世界上两大阵营的两条路线问题，即和平民主阵营的和平路线与帝国主义侵略阵营的战争路线问题。我们既是站在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营方面，中朝又是唇齿相依，当然对于朝鲜问题不能置之不理。
    女一中在讨论时，有一个同学说：“我们现在要从精神上支援朝鲜人民。等美帝国主义进犯我们祖国时，我们再去干涉。”她还没有坐下，就有人站起来激怒地说：不行，什么时候才算侵犯我们祖国？！美国飞机已经空袭我们的领土几十次，美国海军已经侵占我国领土台湾。我们怎么还能不理呢？！就这样，通过这些讨论，师生们的意见都一致了起来。
    现在京市各中学师生对美帝的侵略行为已忍无可忍，都怀着愤怒的心情，表示要立刻行动起来。北师高元明同学说：“美帝不让我们好好念书，我们就要起来跟它干！”河北省师美工组赶制了许多漫画，康乐股领导各班编新歌词，准备对广大市民进行宣传。汇文中学同学们近来都在加紧锻炼身体，许多不爱上体育课的同学，现在也都动起来了。女一中初三四班上体育时还练习抬担架。有的并提出加强防火防特，要求参军。
