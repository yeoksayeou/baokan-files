　　Mutual Exposure of Scandals Between the U.S. and the Philippines, Master and Slave

Xinhua News Agency, 4th: Following the publication of the U.S. "Bell Economic Mission's" report on the so-called "Strengthening the Economy of the Republic of the Philippines" plan, the ruling groups of the U.S. and the Philippines have been mutually exposing each other's scandals. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington: "The Washington Post" editorial, in commenting on the report, attacked the Philippine Quirino puppet government, stating: "Quirino's abolition of habeas corpus in the Philippines is a disappointing sign that moral decay has become widespread in that island nation. The ugly truth is that the Quirino regime is bankrupt, both morally and financially. Fraud and corruption have reached an extreme, and the main culprits appear to be close associates of the President (referring to Quirino), so he cannot and will not remove them. On the one hand, the government desperately engages in extravagant waste, and on the other hand, it is incredibly negligent in tax collection."

According to a United Press report: The Philippine Government Information Bureau also issued a statement on October 25th, sarcastically responding to the Bell report's exposure of Quirino's scandals, stating: "What is not widely understood is that the Philippines' bankruptcy and corruption are closely related to the extortion of Americans and the rampant influence caused by the so-called American standard of living. ...What remains to be universally appreciated is that in terms of corruption, Filipinos are merely petty speculators compared to their more skilled and particularly successful masters (referring to Americans)."

According to Agence France-Presse: Araneta, the economic coordination minister of the Quirino puppet regime, stated in a speech to the Philippine Chamber of Commerce on October 30th that the economic problems of the Philippines should be attributed to the United States, because the United States forced the conclusion of a "trade agreement" with the Philippines in 1946. This agreement allows Americans to have equal rights with Filipinos in developing Philippine natural resources; American goods are imported without tariff restrictions.

　　美菲主奴之间
    互相揭露丑事
    【新华社四日讯】在美国“贝尔经济使团”关于所谓“加强菲律宾共和国经济计划”发表以后，美菲两国统治集团即互相揭发丑事。据美联社华盛顿讯：《华盛顿邮报》社论在评论该报告时，攻击菲律宾季里诺傀儡政府称：“季里诺在菲律宾废止了人身保护权利，这是伤风败纪已在该岛国普遍蔓延的令人失望的征候。丑恶的真相是，季里诺政权无论在德行上或财政上都已破产。诈取和贪污已经达到极点，主犯们看来都是总统（指季里诺）的亲信，所以他不能也不愿赶走他们。一方面政府拚命地奢侈浪费，另一方面政府在征税时则是令人难以置信地疏忽。”
    另据合众社消息：菲律宾政府新闻局于十月二十五日也发表了一项声明，对贝尔报告揭露季里诺的丑事，反唇相讥说：“不为人所广泛了解的是：菲律宾的破产与腐化是与美国人的敲诈勒索，及所谓美国生活水准的肆意挥霍所引起的万恶影响有着密切的关系。……尚待普遍体会的是：在贪污腐化上，菲律宾人在与他们的本领更为高强、特别成功的大师傅们（指美国人）比较起来，不过是小巫见大巫的小投机而已。”
    另据法新社消息：季里诺傀儡政权的经济调配部长阿兰尼塔，于十月三十日向菲律宾商会发表演说时称：菲律宾经济上的毛病应该归咎于美国，因为美国于一九四六年强迫与菲律宾缔结“贸易协定”。这项协定准许美国人在开发菲律宾天然资源上与菲律宾人有同等权利；美国货入口不受关税限制。
