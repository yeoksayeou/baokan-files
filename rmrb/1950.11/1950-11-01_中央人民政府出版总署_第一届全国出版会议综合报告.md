　　Central People's Government Publishing Administration
    Comprehensive Report on the First National Publishing Conference
    ——Report by Director Hu Yuzhi at the 54th Administrative Meeting of the Central People's Government Council on October 13, 1950

    The First National Publishing Conference was held from September 15th to 25th according to the planned schedule. A total of 321 representatives attended and participated, including representatives from major administrative regions, Xinjiang, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and overseas. Among them, there were 54 representatives from the publishing, distribution, periodical, and printing industries in the public sector, 10 from public-private joint ventures, 110 from the private sector, 60 from publishing administrative agencies, 36 from publishing and printing trade unions, 37 from relevant central government agencies and national people's organizations, and 14 specially invited representatives.

    The conference held eight plenary sessions and more than 100 group meetings of various kinds. 138 proposals were received. The Publishing Administration and representatives from various regions and industries made written or oral reports, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Vice Premier Guo, and other leaders personally delivered speeches.

    Prior to the opening of the conference, the National Xinhua Bookstore held its Second Working Conference (from August 29th to September 10th). After the closing of the conference, representatives from the publishing administrative agencies of major administrative regions and important provinces and cities held a publishing administrative conference (from September 28th to 30th). These two conferences also made some important decisions on improving state-owned publishing, strengthening publishing administrative leadership, and conveying and implementing the resolutions of the National Publishing Conference.

    Now, a comprehensive report on the process and important results of this conference is presented as follows:

    (1) Unification of Labor Division and Specialization of State-Owned Publishing Enterprises

    Before the opening of the National Publishing Conference, the Second Working Conference of the National Xinhua Bookstore made several important resolutions on improving state-owned publishing enterprises. The full text of these resolutions will be reviewed and issued separately by the Publishing Administration. The key points are reported as follows:

    1. From 1951 onwards, the Xinhua Bookstore will be transformed into a national professional distribution enterprise, expanding the types of books and periodicals distributed, and strengthening its ties with readers and public and private publishers. It should promote all books and periodicals that are beneficial to the people, regardless of whether they are public or private. In addition, the Xinhua Bookstore should also be responsible for organizing the forces of public and private book vendors to form a national book distribution network, so that the supply of books and periodicals can be widely and deeply rooted in all aspects.

    2. The personnel of the original publishing department of the Xinhua Bookstore and some of the staff of the editorial and review bureau of the Publishing Administration will jointly prepare to establish the People's Publishing House, which will focus on editing and publishing national political theory and policy documents, as well as political current affairs reading materials. At present, it also publishes some popular reading materials and other books and periodicals, and is preparing to develop into a professional national political publishing house in the future.

    3. The editing and publishing departments of the original Xinhua Bookstore in major administrative regions, provinces, and cities should, where possible, be reorganized into local People's Publishing Houses to publish various books and periodicals needed locally.

    4. The printing factories and firms under the original General Administration of the Xinhua Bookstore in Beijing and Tianjin will become separate business units and be managed by the General Administration of Xinhua Printing Factories. Other printing factories and firms under the Xinhua Bookstore in various places will also be separated into independent business units. If there are difficulties, they can be temporarily managed by the local People's Publishing House.

    5. The General Store of Xinhua Bookstore, the Central People's Publishing House, and the General Administration of Xinhua Printing Factories are directly under the Publishing Administration. The local branches of the Xinhua Bookstore are uniformly managed by the General Store of Xinhua Bookstore and are also under the leadership of the local publishing administrative agency. The local People's Publishing House and the local printing factories are under the leadership of the local publishing administrative agency, but must also accept the leadership or guidance of the Central People's Publishing House and the General Administration of Xinhua Printing Factories, respectively.

    6. The Xinhua Bookstore, the People's Publishing House, and the Xinhua Printing Factory are state-owned enterprises of a socialist nature and should be responsible for uniting, leading, and assisting various public and private distribution, publishing, and printing institutions to adjust public-private relations.

    (2) Adjustment and Division of Labor and Cooperation between Public and Private Publishing, Distribution, Periodical, and Printing Industries

    This conference determined the general policy of division of labor and specialization for public and private publishing enterprises. Representatives of private enterprises agreed to the principles of overall planning, taking all factors into consideration, division of labor, and cooperation under the leadership of the government and state-owned enterprises. In addition to the adoption of five resolutions, concrete implementation measures were negotiated separately by representatives of public and private enterprises. Important results include the following:

    1. In terms of division of labor and specialization in publishing, it was generally decided that the Commercial Press and the Zhonghua Book Company should focus on natural sciences, engineering, agriculture, medicine, and health. Sanlian Bookstore and Kaiming Bookstore should focus on applied social sciences, history, literature, and intermediate-level reading materials. The Joint Publishing House for Popular Publishing and the Joint Publishing House for Lianhuanhua should focus on popular reading materials. The Datong Book Company, the Children's Book Company, and the Tonglian Publishing House should focus on reading materials for teenagers and children. The Workers' Publishing House and the Youth Publishing House should serve as specialized publishing houses targeting workers and youth, respectively. The publishing of primary and secondary school textbooks will be based on the original North China and Shanghai Joint Publishing House, and the People's Education Publishing House will be established. Publicly-owned or public-private joint venture professional publishing houses are also being prepared for literature and art. The above-mentioned professional publishing houses will be led separately by their respective professional agencies. In this way, publishers can each give play to their strengths, meet practical needs, publish books in a planned way, and reduce duplication, waste, and random publishing. However, specialization refers to the direction of development and should be carried out in a step-by-step manner. Specialization is also not a patent or monopoly.

    2. In terms of distribution, it was decided to unite public and private distribution institutions (including book stalls, book vendors, post offices, cooperatives, etc.) to form a vast distribution network, led by the state-owned Xinhua Bookstore, to launch a national reading campaign. Five major bookstores in China, the Commercial Press, the Zhonghua Book Company, the Kaiming Bookstore, the Sanlian Bookstore, and the Joint Publishing House, have agreed to gradually merge or jointly operate their distribution agencies, cooperate with the Xinhua Bookstore with a division of labor, in order to reduce distribution costs and avoid competition between counterparts.

    3. In terms of periodicals, this conference agreed to move towards professional division of labor and eliminate the current duplication and confusion.

    4. In terms of printing, there is currently overproduction and unemployment is quite common. The conference suggested that agencies and organizations should not establish new factories at present, and their printed materials can be contracted to existing public and private printing factories. Existing public and private printing factories should also not blindly expand.

    5. In order to remedy the unbalanced development of the publishing industry, the conference decided that various local publishing institutions should be established in a planned way, with emphasis on publishing and distribution work in remote areas, and that publishing houses for minority languages should be established.

    6. The conference agreed that the planning of the national publishing industry should begin next year. The Publishing Administration will formulate an annual publishing plan, which will be jointly guaranteed by public and private publishing, distribution, and printing industries, in order to overcome the current difficulties and embark on the path of development within three years.

    (3) Strengthening of Publishing Administrative Leadership and Trade Union Organizations

    After listening to the reports from various regions, the National Publishing Conference and the Publishing Administrative Conference decided to strengthen administrative leadership over public and private enterprises. Public and private publishing houses and periodical agencies across the country should submit regular reports to the publishing administrative agencies. Those led or guided by various professional agencies should also report to the professional agencies at the same time. Publishing administrative agencies should be separated from state-owned enterprises. Some biases exist in the publishing administrative work in some regions, such as carrying out manuscript censorship and not taking care of private enterprises. These were also properly corrected at this conference.

    The trade union group of the National Publishing Conference held a separate meeting under the leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and established the preparatory committee of the National Press, Publication, and Printing Trade Union, preparing to establish a national trade union organization in a short period of time in order to increase production and assist in improving the publishing industry.

    (4) Progress of the Conference and Spirit of the Resolutions

    Thanks to the correct leadership of the higher authorities and thorough preparations in advance, the progress of the conference was generally satisfactory. Representatives of public and private enterprises across the country demonstrated an unprecedented spirit of unity and cooperation. In the past, private enterprises complained that the government did not provide enough care and that state-owned enterprises had a tendency to close-doorism. At this conference, they understood the government's policies and gained confidence in overcoming difficulties and moving forward steadily. Public representatives also summarized and exchanged experiences from these conferences, corrected biases, and strengthened their sense of political responsibility.

    The conference enhanced the political awareness of public and private publishing, distribution, and printing workers, unanimously agreed that publishing, distribution, and printing work is an important political and cultural education work, corrected certain purely profit-oriented viewpoints, unanimously agreed to the principle of the publishing industry being responsible to the people, that publishers should be responsible for the content of publications, and should accept public criticism, unanimously agreed to increase the remuneration of authors where possible and to reduce the burden on readers as much as possible; unanimously agreed that the publishing industry should be gradually planned in the future and combined with reality, in order to eliminate the current blindness and anarchy, and avoid meaningless speculative competition.

    The conference's methods for division of labor and specialization were not specific and clear enough, and no specific decisions were made on the improvement of periodicals and magazines and the adjustment of the printing industry. These are some of the shortcomings. However, the conference adopted five resolutions, which the public and private representatives regarded as a publishing convention or a common work program, guaranteeing joint implementation. Therefore, it can be said that the two main tasks expected of this conference—unified division of labor and adjustment of public-private relations—have achieved initial success. If the various resolutions and the spirit of the conference can be implemented, it will have some effect on the improvement of the publishing industry in the future.

　　中央人民政府出版总署
    第一届全国出版会议综合报告
    ——胡愈之署长在一九五○年十月十三日中央人民政府政务院第五十四次政务会议上的报告
    第一届全国出版会议按照预定计划，于九月十五日至二十五日举行，出席列席代表共计三百二十一人，包含各大行政区、新疆、内蒙自治区及海外代表。其中出版、发行、期刊、印刷业代表，计公营五十四人，公私合营十人，私营一百一十人，出版行政机关代表六十人，出版印刷工会代表三十六人，中央各有关机关及全国性人民团体代表三十七人，特邀代表十四人。
    这次会议举行了全体会议八次，各种分组会议一百次以上。收到提案一百三十八件。出版总署及各地各业代表都分别作了书面或口头报告，并由朱总司令、郭副总理及各首长亲临讲话。
    在大会开幕以前，全国新华书店举行第二届工作会议（八月二十九日起至九月十日止），闭幕以后中央各大行政区及重要省市出版行政机关代表又举行了出版行政会议（九月二十八日起三十日止）。这两次会议对于改进国营出版业，加强出版行政领导和传达并执行全国出版会议决议也都作了一些重要的决定。
    现在把这次会议经过及其所获重要结果综合报告如下：
    （一）国营出版事业的统一分工与专业化
    在全国出版会议开幕之前，全国新华书店二届工作会议中对于改进国营出版事业，作了若干重要决议。此项决议全文除由出版总署审核另行发布外，先将其中要点报告如下：
    １、从一九五一年起，新华书店改为全国性的专业发行企业机构，扩大发行书刊种类，加强与读者及公私出版者的联系，凡对人民有益书刊，不分公私，均应予以推销。此外新华书店并应负责组织公私书刊贩卖业的力量，构成全国书籍发行网，以使书刊供应普遍深入到各方面。
    ２、原有新华书店出版部人员与出版总署编审局的部分工作人员联合筹建人民出版社，以编辑出版全国性的政治理论和政策文件及政治时事读物为主，目前同时出版某些通俗读物和其他书刊，准备日后发展为专业的国家政治出版社。
    ３、各大行政区、各省市原属于新华书店的编辑出版部门在可能条件下，分别改建地方人民出版社，出版地方需要的各种书刊。
    ４、原新华书店总管理处所属京津两地印刷厂行单独成为一个企业单位，设新华印刷厂总管理处予以管理。其他各地新华书店所属印刷厂行亦分立为独立企业单位，如有困难则可暂时由地方人民出版社统一管理。
    ５、新华书店总店，中央人民出版社，新华印刷厂总管理处，均直属出版总署。新华书店的各地分支机构，统一由新华书店总店管理，同时接受当地出版行政机关的领导。地方人民出版社，及地方印刷厂均受地方出版行政机关领导，但须同时分别接受中央人民出版社及新华印刷厂总管理处的领导或指导。
    ６、新华书店、人民出版社及新华印刷厂为社会主义性质的国营企业，对各种公私发行出版印刷机构应负团结领导协助以调整公私关系的责任。
    （二）公私出版、发行、期刊、印刷业的调整和分工合作
    这次会议确定了公私出版事业分工专业化的总方针。私营企业代表都同意了在政府和国营企业领导下统筹兼顾分工合作的原则。具体实施的办法，除通过五项决议外，复经公私各企业代表分头进行协商，重要的结果有下列各项：
    １、出版分工专业化，在大体上决定商务印书馆和中华书局倾向自然科学、理工、农业、医药卫生方面。三联书店、开明书店倾向于应用社会科学，文史和中级读物。通俗出版业联合书店与连环图画出版业联合书店倾向于通俗读物。大东书局、儿童书局与童联出版社倾向于少年儿童读物。工人出版社与青年出版社分别作为以工人和青年为对象的专业出版社。中小学教科书的出版工作则以原有华北与上海联合出版社为基础，成立人民教育出版社。文学与艺术方面亦准备建立公营的或公私合营的专业的出版社。以上各种专业出版社均由各专业机关分别加以领导。如是可使各出版家各自发挥其特长，配合实际需要，有计划地出书，并减少重复浪费与乱出书的现象。但专业化是指发展的方向，要有步骤的进行，专业化也不是专利或垄断。
    ２、发行方面决定团结公私发行机构（包括书摊、书贩、邮局、合作社等），组成广大发行网，以国营新华书店为领导，展开全国范围的读书运动。国内五家较大的书店，商务印书馆、中华书局、开明书店、三联书店和联营书店已同意将其发行机构逐渐合并或联合经营，与新华书店分工合作，以减低发行费用，避免同业竞争。
    ３、期刊方面，在这次会议中同意趋向专业分工，消除目前存在着的重复混乱现象。
    ４、印刷方面，在目前生产过剩，失业现象颇为普遍。会议建议各机关团体目前不再建立新厂，其印件可交现有公私印厂承印，原有公私印厂亦不应盲目扩充。
    ５、为补救出版事业发展的不平衡现象，会议决定应有计划地建立各种地方出版机构，注重偏远地区的出版发行工作，并建立少数民族语文出版社。
    ６、会议同意明年度开始全国出版事业的计划化，由出版总署制定全年出版计划，公私出版发行印刷业共同保证执行，以期在三年内克服目前存在的困难，走上发展的途程。
    （三）出版行政领导与工会组织的加强
    全国出版会议和出版行政会议听取了各地报告之后，决定加强对公私企业的行政领导。全国公私出版社与期刊社应向出版行政机关作经常报告。其由各专业机关领导或指导者，向各专业机关同时作报告。出版行政机关应与公营企业分开。目前某些地区的出版行政工作存在着一些偏向，如进行原稿检查及不照顾私营企业等，在这次会议中也予以适当的纠正。
    全国出版会议工会组在全国总工会领导之下另行开会，产生了全国新闻出版印刷工会筹备会，准备在短时期内，成立全国性的工会组织，以增加生产，协助改进出版事业。
    （四）会议的进行情况与决议的精神
    这次会议由于上级的正确领导与事前的充分准备，进行的经过尚称满意。全国公私企业代表表现了空前的团结合作精神。私营企业方面过去抱怨政府照顾不够及公营企业有关门主义倾向，在这次会议中了解了政府的政策，对于克服困难，稳步前进，已有了信心。公营代表也从这几次会议中，总结和交流经验，纠正偏向，加强了政治责任感。
    会议提高了公私出版、发行、印刷工作者的政治认识，一致同意了出版发行印刷工作是一种重要的政治工作和文化教育工作，纠正了某些单纯的营利观点，一致同意了出版事业对人民负责的原则，出版家要对出版物的内容负责，而且应当接受群众的批评意见，一致同意了在可能条件下提高著作人报酬并尽可能减轻读者负担；一致同意了今后出版事业要逐步计划化并与实际结合，以消灭目前存在着的盲目性和无政府状态，避免无意义的投机竞争。
    这次会议关于分工专业化的办法，还不够具体明确，对于期刊杂志的改进和印刷业的调整也没有作具体决定，这是其中的一些缺点。但是会议通过了五项决议，出席公私代表把这些决议看作出版事业公约或共同工作纲领，保证共同加以执行。因此，可以说这次会议预期的两项主要任务——统一分工和调整公私关系——已得到了初步的成就。要是能够把各项决议和会议的精神贯彻下去，对于今后出版事业的改进，是会有一些效果的。
