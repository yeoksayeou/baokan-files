Xinhua News Agency, 4th: U.S. imperialism is illegally utilizing Japanese military strength to carry out aggression. According to a report from the Electric Communication Agency in Washington on the 2nd, Prime Minister Yoshida and MacArthur's staff recently drafted a so-called "Explanatory Document on the Policies of the Japanese Government." The document mentioned that Japan has taken all necessary measures to allow the U.S. Seventh Fleet to fully utilize Japanese naval bases, and U.S. aircraft are now using Japanese airfields, which have been repaired and expanded at the request of MacArthur Headquarters. The Japanese government has provided 1 billion yen to train Japanese military pilots and supply Japanese troops in Korea. The document stated that four Japanese shipbuilding companies have accepted orders from the U.S. Navy to build 50 ships. At the same time, the Japanese government has recently recommissioned 12 destroyers and 800 landing craft. Officially, these ships are said to be for maritime patrols, but in reality, most of them are participating in the transportation of military supplies to Korea and Taiwan.

The Electric Communication Agency stated that the U.S. State Department considers the report to be an official report from the Japanese government regarding Japan's active participation in U.S. plans in the Far East. State Department officials and MacArthur greatly appreciated this. MacArthur pointed out that the steps taken by the Yoshida government "in supporting the U.S. operations in Korea are of immense value."

　　美帝在侵略战争中利用日本军事力量
    【新华社四日讯】美帝国主义正非法地利用日本的军事力量进行侵略。据电通社华盛顿二日讯：不久前，吉田首相与麦克阿瑟的幕僚曾拟订所谓《日本政府政策的说明书》。该说明书中提到：日本已采取了一切必要的措施，使美国第七舰队充分使用日本的海军基地，美国飞机现已使用日本的飞机场，这些机场已应麦克阿瑟总部之请，予以修理和扩充。日本政府为训练日本军事驾驶员和供应日本在朝鲜的军队，已提供十亿日元。该说明书称，日本四家造船公司已接受美国海军部建造五十艘船只的定货。同时，日本政府最近已将驱逐舰十二艘、登陆艇八百只重行服役。这些船只官方说明是用于海上巡逻，但实际上，其中大多数正参加向朝鲜及台湾运送军事物资。
    电通社称：美国国务院认为该报告是日本政府关于日本积极参加美国在远东的计划的官方报告。国务院官员和麦克阿瑟对此大为赞赏。麦克阿瑟指出吉田政府“在支持美国在朝鲜的行动中所采取的步骤，有巨大的价值”。
