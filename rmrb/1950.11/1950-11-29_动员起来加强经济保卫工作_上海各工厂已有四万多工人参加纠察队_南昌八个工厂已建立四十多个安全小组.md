　　Mobilize to Strengthen Economic Defense Work
    Shanghai Factories Already Have Over 40,000 Workers Participating in the Militia
    More Than 40 Safety Groups Have Been Established in Eight Factories in Nanchang
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 28th: Over 40,000 workers in Shanghai factories have joined the militia, and they are participating in the Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Homeland and Defend the Country movement with practical actions such as increasing production, protecting factories, and doing a good job in winter defense work. In order to do a good job in economic defense work, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions convened a city-wide meeting of worker militia cadres on the 19th of this month to mobilize and make arrangements. Currently, the militia teams in various factories have been divided into groups, taking turns on guard duty and patrolling, and regularly going deep into the workshops for inspection. Many factories have reduced the occurrence of accidents as a result of the militia's inspections. For example, at the Shanghai Electric Power Company, militia members discovered that the No. 9 car switch had tripped, and immediately notified the engineer to repair it, thus preventing an accident. Recently, the canopy of the No. 10 motor generator suddenly caught fire, and the militia and firefighters were all dispatched to rescue it from the flames, ensuring the rapid restoration of power. In their militia work, the members also conduct in-depth propaganda, helping general workers to recognize the aggressive crimes of American imperialism and the sabotage conspiracies of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents.
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, November 28th: Workers and staff in Nanchang factories and enterprises are actively participating in economic defense work, and a mass-based road protection movement is being carried out along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Nanchang-Jiujiang railways. More than 40 safety groups have been established in eight factories throughout Nanchang, with a total of more than 300 workers participating in the factory protection militia. Under the leadership of the factory safety committee, they take turns on duty day and night, guarding the factory grounds and workshops, and actively carrying out fire prevention, theft prevention, and anti-espionage work. Some workers at the Jiangxi Machinery Factory, led by labor model Qiu Yeheng, even voluntarily stay in the workshops to guard them day and night. Workers at the Jiangxi Agricultural Tool Factory have requested to learn military common sense in their spare time in order to better protect the factory. In order to strengthen fire prevention, theft prevention, air defense, and anti-espionage work, the Nanchang Branch of the Shanghai Railway Bureau has launched a mass-based road protection, station protection, and bridge protection movement along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Nanchang-Jiujiang railways. In Dengjiabu, Dongxiang, Pingxiang and other places along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line, the masses in twenty-one townships have organized road protection groups and night patrol groups and have begun to protect the roads.

    【新华社上海二十八日电】上海各工厂已有四万多工人参加纠察队，他们正以增产、护厂、作好冬防工作等实际行动来参加抗美援朝保家卫国运动。为了作好经济保卫工作，上海总工会已于本月十九日召开全市工人纠察队干部大会，进行动员与布置。现各厂纠察队已分编小组，轮流站岗巡逻，并随时深入车间检查。不少工厂经纠察队的检查，已减少了事故的发生。如上海电力公司，纠察队员发现九号车开关跳脱，当即通知工程师修理，因此防止了事故的发生。最近该厂十号电机方棚突然燃烧，纠察队、消防队即全部出动冒火抢救，保证了电力的迅速恢复。在纠察工作中，队员们还深入宣传时事，帮助一般工友认清美国帝国主义的侵略罪行以及蒋匪特务的破坏阴谋。
    【新华社南昌二十八日电】南昌各工厂企业职工积极参加经济保卫工作，浙赣、南浔铁路沿线正开展群众性的护路运动。南昌全市已有八个工厂建立了四十多个安全小组，共有三百多个职工参加了护厂纠察队，在工厂安全委员会领导下，日夜轮流值班，巡守厂院和车间，积极进行防火、防盗、防特务的工作。江西机器厂部分职工，在劳动模范仇业衡带头下，甚至自动到车间住宿，日夜守护。江西农具工厂工人则要求工余学习军事常识，以便更好地保护工厂。上海铁路局南昌分局各公安段，为加强防火、防盗、防空、防特务的工作，已在所属浙赣、南浔铁路沿线，发起群众性的护路、护站、护桥运动。浙赣沿线邓家埠、东乡、萍乡等地，已有二十一个乡的群众，组织了护路小组和夜间巡查小组，开始护路。
