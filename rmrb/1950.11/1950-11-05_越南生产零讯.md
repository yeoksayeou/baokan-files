　　Vietnamese Production News Briefs
    In Thừa Thiên Province, Central Vietnam, a recent bumper harvest saw farmers collect nearly 17,000 tons of rice, accounting for 97% of the province's total harvest, thwarting the French army's attempt to seize the autumn harvest. To this end, Phạm Văn Đồng, Deputy Prime Minister of the Vietnamese People's Government, sent a telegram to the Thừa Thiên Province government and local people, expressing congratulations.
    This year, the cultivated area has been expanded throughout Vietnam. The people of the provinces on the plateau west of Hanoi have planted more rice and beans this year than in 1949. The Fourth Interzone of Central Vietnam planted 6,130 hectares of rice paddies, and the swampy areas of South Vietnam planted 78,000 hectares of rice paddies, exceeding the planned target by one-third. North and Central Vietnam have successively reclaimed 12,500 hectares of wasteland.
    Farmers in Sơn Tịnh District, Quảng Ngãi Province, Central Vietnam, recently completed the excavation of a two-kilometer-long canal to irrigate 200 hectares of rice paddies. Farmers in Thanh Hóa Province, Central Vietnam, built and repaired many river dikes, protecting 14,500 hectares of rice paddies.
    In the first half of this year, farmers in the Fifth Interzone of Central Vietnam reclaimed 7,226 hectares of rice paddies, built 329 dams, and dug 1,200 irrigation ditches.
    Farmers in Bình Định Province, Central Vietnam, cultivated 8,000 hectares of cotton fields this year, an increase of 2,000 hectares compared to 1949, and dug 12,945 meters of ditches, irrigating 5,679 hectares of rice paddies.
    In the first half of this year, the production assistance office of Hà Giang Province in North Vietnam lent 2 million Vietnamese đồng, 250 head of livestock, and 4,500 kilograms of seeds to poor farmers in the province, enabling them to complete the planting of late rice and reclaim large areas of wasteland.
