　　Party Organizations in North China
　  Begin Grassroots Rectification and Training
  　North China Bureau Clearly Instructs on Guiding Principles and Steps to Complete This Plan
    [Xinhua News Agency] The grassroots organizations of the Chinese Communist Party in North China will universally launch rectification and training work starting in mid-November. This rectification and training is being conducted on the basis of the rectification campaign that has already been carried out by more than 100,000 Party member cadres in the region. The North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee issued instructions on October 23, clearly stipulating the guiding principles and steps to complete this plan.

    The purpose of this rectification and training is to improve the political quality of Party members, overcome commandism, promote a democratic style of work, consolidate and purify Party organizations, and strengthen the combat effectiveness of branches to meet the needs of the new situation. The instructions require that from mid-November of this year to three months before the spring plowing of next year, 1/4 to 1/2 of the Party members in the branches should be rectified and trained, except for disaster areas and land reform areas, which will not be carried out for the time being. The main content of intensive training includes production policies, the mass line, current affairs education, and basic Party knowledge. The instructions require Party organizations in various localities to help Party members understand the connection between internationalism and patriotism, the harm of the commandist style of work, and how the Party should rely on the masses and better serve the people, among other basic principles, during this study.

    Now, the provinces of North China have formulated specific rectification and training plans in accordance with the spirit of the instructions and in light of local conditions, and key rectification and training has already begun. In order to carry out the region-wide rectification and training step by step under unified leadership, the committee of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee guiding the rectification and training has been formally established, and will send cadres to various localities to promote the work.

    【新华社讯】华北各地中国共产党的基层组织，将于十一月中旬起普遍展开整顿与训练的工作。此次整训是在全区十余万党员干部已经进行了整风的基础上进行的。中共中央华北局已于十月二十三日发出指示，明确规定了完成这一计划的方针与步骤。
    此次整训的目的，在于提高党员的政治质量，克服命令主义，发扬民主作风；巩固和纯洁党的组织，加强支部的战斗力，以适应新形势的需要。指示要求各地自今年十一月中旬起至明年春耕前三个月内，除灾区与土改区暂不进行外，其他地区要整训支部党员四分之一至二分之一。集训主要内容为生产政策、群众路线、时事教育、党的基本知识。指示要求各地组织在此次学习中，帮助党员理解国际主义与爱国主义的联系、强迫命令作风对工作的危害、以及党应如何依靠群众并更好的为人民服务等基本道理。
    现华北各省已依照指示的精神，结合当地情况，分别制定具体整训计划，重点整训均已开始。为使全区整训在统一的领导下有步骤地进行，中共中央华北局指导整训的委员会已正式成立，并将派遣干部分赴各地，推动工作。
