　　Xinhua News Agency, 26th. Tax collection in the third quarter in the five provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, Pingyuan, Chahar, and Suiyuan has been successfully completed, thanks to the people's government's implementation of the spirit of tax adjustment and the active tax payment by industrialists and merchants.
    The third quarter tax collection in the above five provinces was carried out under favorable conditions such as stable prices, adjusted public-private relations, a shift towards industrial and commercial prosperity, and, in particular, an influx of increased farmer purchasing power into the market after a bumper harvest.
    During the tax collection process, tax personnel in various regions have universally strengthened their policy viewpoints and generally can implement the principle of collecting what should be collected and not collecting what should not be collected, according to the spirit of the central tax policy. Before collection, they generally conduct discussions through people's representative conferences and symposiums with industrialists and merchants, and widely publicize tax policies through radio broadcasts, blackboards, and other means, so that industrialists and merchants understand the principle of tax calculation according to rates. At the people's representative conference in Xingtai County, Hebei Province, representatives of industrialists and merchants said, "In the past, we could only calculate our operating costs, and we couldn't figure out how much tax the state wanted. Now it's all clear!"
    Tax bureaus in various regions not only conduct typical surveys at the beginning of tax collection but also frequently strengthen their understanding of the daily business conditions of taxpayers. Therefore, they can grasp relatively reliable materials and thus expose the erroneous behavior of some industrialists and merchants in concealing their business volume, so that tax collection is fair and reasonable. For example, Xinxiang City found that the concealed business volume accounted for one to twenty-three times the self-reported business volume.
    In the tax collection process in various regions, the tax review committees composed of tax bureaus, federations of industry and commerce, and employee organizations have played a certain role in reasonably adjusting the burden. For example, in Guangling County, Chahar, because the evaluation was fair and everyone was satisfied, the third quarter tax revenue was fully paid within ten days.
    In the third quarter tax collection work in the above five provinces, some tax cadres mistakenly believed that "tax adjustment means reducing tasks." In some areas of Chahar, phenomena such as not managing the market, not cracking down on smuggling, and not urging the payment of outstanding debts once occurred, resulting in a sharp reduction in tax revenue, but this has been promptly corrected by the local government. At present, there are still some areas where there is a certain degree of unevenness in the tax burden on industry and commerce. For example, in Huaxian County and Puyang County in the Puyang Prefecture of Pingyuan Province, the market conditions and the number of merchants and people are similar, but the industrial and commercial tax levied in the two places differs by nearly two times; similar situations also exist between industries, between urban and rural areas, and between households, the reason being that the typical materials grasped by the tax bureaus are not yet practical enough. This phenomenon has now attracted the attention of tax bureaus in various regions and is being corrected.

    华北完成第三季税收
    税收人员政策观点普遍加强
    【新华社二十六日讯】山西、河北、平原、察哈尔和绥远五省第三季度税收，在人民政府贯彻调整税收精神及工商业者积极缴纳下，已胜利完成。
    上述五省第三季度税收是在物价稳定，公私关系经过调整，工商业转向繁荣，尤其是在丰收后增涨了的农民购买力涌入市场等有利条件下进行的。
    各地税收工作人员在税收工作过程中，政策观点已普遍加强，一般都能根据中央税收政策的精神，执行应征的征、不应征的不征。在征收以前一般都通过各界人民代表会、工商业者座谈会，进行商讨，并经过广播、黑板报等方式，广泛宣传税收政策，使工商业者了解了依率计征的道理。河北省邢台县各界人民代表会上，工商业代表说：“过去只能自己算营业成本，算不出国家要多少税来，现在一清二楚了！”
    各地税局不仅在开征时作典型调查，而且经常加强对纳税户日常营业状况的了解。因此能够掌握到比较可靠的材料，并从而揭露了某些工商业者隐瞒营业额的错误行为，使税收做到公平合理。如新乡市曾查出隐瞒营业额竟占自报营业额的一倍到二十三倍。
    在各地税收过程中，由税局、工商联合会及职工团体三方面组成的税务复议委员会，在合理调整负担上发挥了一定的作用。如察哈尔广灵县由于评议公道，大家满意，因而第三季度税收在十天内就全部缴齐。
    在上述五省第三季度税收征收工作中，也曾有些税务干部误认为“调整税收就是减少任务”，察哈尔部分地区一度发生不管理市场、不缉私补漏、不催交尾欠等现象，使得税收大减，但已经过当地政府及时纠正。目前还有些地区在工商业税负担上还存在着某种程度的轻重不均现象。如平原省濮阳专区的滑县和濮阳县，集市情况及商户、人口都相差不多，但两地所征工商业税相差近两倍；在行业与行业之间、城乡之间、户与户之间也有类似情形，其原因是税局所掌握的典型材料还不够切实。这一现象现已引起各地税局注意，并正纠正中。
