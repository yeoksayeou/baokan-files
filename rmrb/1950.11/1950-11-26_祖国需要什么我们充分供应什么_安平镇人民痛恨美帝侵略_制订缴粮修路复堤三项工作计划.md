Whatever the Motherland Needs, We Will Fully Supply
Anping Town People Hate American Imperialist Aggression
Formulate a Three-Item Work Plan for Grain Delivery, Road Repair, and Embankment Restoration

[This newspaper reports] The heroic people of Anping Town, Xianghe County (now under Tong County), who once resisted and repelled the American army's invasion, have displayed their patriotic enthusiasm in the current nationwide movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. The People's Representatives Conference of the town, held on the 15th, issued a declaration stating: More than four years ago, the American imperialists acted as the vanguard for Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops in attacking the Jidong Liberated Area right here. Now, the American imperialists want to follow the old path of the Japanese invaders, first occupying Korea and then attacking China. We, the people of Anping Town, warn them: that is simply a dream! Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we, the people of Anping Town, have stood up and obtained land; we will not allow anyone to infringe upon our happy days. We, the people of the entire town, pledge to oppose American imperialist aggression with practical actions such as enthusiastically paying agricultural taxes, actively carrying out winter production, and supporting our volunteer forces. All the militia of the town wrote a letter to the Korean People's Army, expressing: We resolutely support your war of liberation. Cadres and the masses of Back Street, Maizi Street, East Street, and other streets in the town held a meeting on the 13th to discuss current affairs. At the meeting, various proposals to resist America and aid Korea were put forward. Village Chief Zhang Fengshu said: "I hate American imperialist aggression from the bottom of my heart. On behalf of all the villagers, I give it a thumbs down and will fight it to the end!" On the spot, everyone made three work plans: first, to complete the village's public grain task five days early; second, to guarantee the completion of the 300-meter earth road repair assigned by the government in four days; and third, to strive to complete the Qinglongwan River embankment restoration project as soon as possible. Finally, it was unanimously proposed: In order to resist America and aid Korea, we guarantee to fully supply whatever the motherland needs. Note: In 1946, while flying the banner of mediating the Chinese civil war, the American imperialists actively helped Chiang Kai-shek to plan attacks on the liberated areas. In July, the American beast soldiers directly attacked our Yidong Liberated Area, creating the "Anping Incident" that shocked the whole country at that time. Anping Town is close to the Beijing-Tianjin Railway. The farmers there, like the farmers in other liberated areas, were working diligently. American troops often sat in cars and shot at the local farmers with machine guns. On July 29, American troops and Chiang bandit troops attacked the people of Anping again. The people of Anping and the local garrison could no longer endure it and rushed forward. As a result, this group of beasts was beaten so badly that they could not take care of their heads or tails, suffering 29 casualties; we seized 3 guns and 3 cars. Although the seized materials were returned to them through the mediation of a three-person team, the destruction of the people of Anping by the American and Chiang bandits intensified. Chiang's bandit troops often came to the village to ransack homes, burn, kill and harass. The people of Anping will forever remember the atrocities of the American and Chiang bandits!

　　祖国需要什么我们充分供应什么
    安平镇人民痛恨美帝侵略 
    制订缴粮修路复堤三项工作计划
    【本报讯】曾为美军进犯并将其击退的英勇的香河县安平镇（现属通县）人民，在今天全国正进行的抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，发扬了爱国热情。该镇十五日召开的各界人民代表会议发表宣言称：四年多以前，美帝曾在我们这里为进攻冀东解放区的蒋匪军打先锋。现在美帝又要走日寇的老路，先占朝鲜，再进攻我中国。我们安平镇人民警告它：那简直是梦想！我们安平镇人民在共产党领导下，翻了身，得到了土地；幸福的日子不容许任何人侵犯。我们全镇人民誓以踊跃缴纳公粮积极开展冬季生产、支援我志愿部队的实际行动来反对美帝侵略。该镇全体民兵并写信慰问朝鲜人民军，表示：坚决支援你们的解放战争。该镇后街、麦子街、东街等街干部群众于十三日集会讨论时事，会上纷纷发表了抗美援朝的各种主张。村长张凤书说：“我从心眼里憎恨美帝的侵略。我代表全村人民挑起大拇指头，要和它干到底！”当场大家订出了三项工作计划：一、提早五天完成全村公粮任务；二、政府分配的修土汽车路三百公尺，保证四天完成；三、争取早日完成青龙湾河复堤工程。最后并一致提出：为了抗美援朝，祖国需要什么，我们保证充分供给什么。按，一九四六年，美帝一方面打着调停中国内战的幌子，一面积极帮助蒋介石布置进攻解放区的计划。七月间，美帝兽兵们直接进攻我翼东解放区，造成了当时轰动全国的“安平事件”。安平镇紧靠京津铁路。该地农民和其他解放区的农民一样，当时正勤劳地耕作着。美军经常坐着汽车用机枪射击该地农民。七月二十九日，美军及蒋匪军多人又向安平人民进攻，安平人民与当地守军再不能忍耐，一拥而上，结果这帮野兽被我打得头尾不顾，伤亡二十九人；被我缴获枪三支、汽车三辆。后虽经三人小组调解，将缴获物资交还他们，但美蒋匪军对安平人民的摧残日益加甚。蒋匪军经常来村翻箱倒柜，烧杀骚扰。安平人民把美蒋匪军的暴行永远记在心里！
