Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front:

　　Xinhua News Agency, Northern Korea Frontline Dispatch: Our correspondent reports from the frontlines in and around Unsan that a large number of letters from American soldiers killed in battle are scattered across the ground. From these randomly picked-up letters, one can discern the anti-war sentiment among the American soldiers. Gripped by intense homesickness, they are driven to die on foreign soil by the bloodthirsty aggressors Truman and MacArthur. In a letter dated October 10th, soldier L. Bill's brother, William May, wrote, "Dear, we are all worried about you, but can only hope and pray for your safety!" The letter concludes with the line, "To be honest, what you are doing overseas is like sitting on a volcano." This is how the ordinary people of America feel, filled with fear, about the aggressive war their government is engaged in. But they should know that not only have their Bills and Hulls become and will become cannon fodder, but the entire American nation has also been placed on a volcano by the likes of MacArthur.
　　Next to a corpse shattered by artillery shells was a letter that soldier Norberg wrote to his father on November 1st. This letter was never sent because the battle began, and he became a victim. The letter stated, "I already told you last time that we were going to board a ship and leave Korea, but on the same day, the superiors told us that we were going to the front line. Everyone was driven crazy by this news." Another soldier, named Narman, wrote to his father in a letter that was never sent: "The weather is terribly cold, I don't want to go to this place anymore..." But they never knew that they wouldn't even have the chance to tell their loved ones in America about their despair. Their bodies, along with these letters, were left on the land on this side of the ocean.
　　After the battle, a reporter visited an American prisoner of war in a small village nestled against the mountains. The reporter approached a small house with a row of civilian dwellings in front of it, which had just been destroyed by American aggressor planes the night before. The ruins were still smoldering. An old woman was searching through the ashes and rubble for the remaining scorched white corn cobs. Soldier William Werner suddenly shouted at me, "Why should we have a war with you?!" A bewildered look appeared on his face. I pointed to the still-smoldering embers in front of me and told him, "Why did the American bombers come to do this? Why did you cross the ocean to come to Korea? Your tycoons and generals are commanding you not only to destroy Korea and annihilate Korea, but also to rule Asia and the entire world. Of course, we Asian people must oppose you doing this." I then asked him, "What are your feelings about the war you have already been involved in?" He asked for a pen and wrote on our notepad, "War is a terrible thing," and then emphatically repeated it. As he spoke, he took out a small notebook, which contained a photo of his lover, as well as another photo of five or six naked men and women huddled together on a large bed. William Werner explained that this was a photo he and several companions took with some Japanese women in Japan. William Werner was a student at the University of California. From his words, it can be seen that he seems to have not completely lost his conscience, but he took such lewd photos, and when he was seen, he was not ashamed at all. This makes it easy for us to understand how MacArthur treats Japan and Korea as places for American soldiers to vent their animalistic desires, and how he maintains morale with licentious bestiality: "All the girls are yours!"
　　The reporter also contacted a surgeon named Pearl B. Lucas. The reporter asked him, "For yourself, why did you come to Korea to participate in the war?" He replied, "If I hadn't come, I would probably have been put in jail!"

　　侵朝美军厌战情绪
    新华社朝鲜战地报道
    【新华社朝鲜北部某地二十五日电】本社记者自战地报道称：在云山及其周围的战场上，大批美国战死士兵的信件散满一地，从随手拾得的信件中，可以看出美军士兵的厌战情绪。他们带着浓重的乡愁，被血腥侵略者杜鲁门和麦克阿瑟等人驱使着死在异国的土地上。士兵贝尔（L. Bill）的弟弟威廉·梅（William May）在十月十日的来信中说：“亲爱的，我们全都为你担忧，但只能希望和祷告你平安！”信末有一句说：“说实在话，你在海外所进行的事业，正像坐在火山口一般。”美国的普通人民，对他们政府所从事的侵略战争，就是这样满怀着恐惧的。但他们应该知道：不仅他们的贝尔和赫尔已经和将要做炮灰，而且整个美国国家，也已经被麦克阿瑟之流安置在火山口上了。
    在一个被炮弹炸得碎裂了的尸体旁边，是兵士瑙尔比（Norberg）在十一月一日写给他爸爸的信。这封信尚未寄出，战斗就开始了，而他也就作了牺牲品。信上说：“上次我已经告诉你：我们要上船离开朝鲜，但在同一天上级又告诉我们说，我们是要到前线去。每个人都为这个消息弄得发了疯。”另外一封署名纳尔曼（Narman）的兵士，写给他父亲的、尚未寄出的信中说：“天气冷得可怕，我再也不愿意到这个地方……”。可是他们那里知道，连这种懊丧的心情也来不及告诉他的在美洲的亲人。他们的尸体已和这些信件一起遗留在大洋此岸的土地上了。
    战斗结束后，记者在一个靠山的小村庄，访问一个美国俘虏。记者走近一间小屋，小屋前面有一排民房，在前一天晚上刚被美国侵略者的飞机炸毁。废墟上，还在冒着烟。一个老太婆正在草灰和瓦砾堆中，搜寻那些残留的已被烧焦了的白玉米棒子。雇兵威廉·威尔诺尔（Williau Werner）突如其来地喊我一声：“为什么我们和你们要有战争？！”他的脸上露出迷惘的神情。我指着前面还未熄灭的余烬告诉他：“为什么美国轰炸机要来干这个？为什么你们要远渡重洋到朝鲜来？你们的财阀和将军们指挥着你们，不仅要毁灭朝鲜和灭亡朝鲜，还要统治亚洲和全世界，我们亚洲人民当然要反对你们这样作的。”我又问他：“对于你已经从事过的战争你有什么感想？”他要了笔在我们笔记本上写了一句：“战争是坏透了的事”，写完了又加重地念了一遍。说话中他拿出了一个小本子，里面夹有一张他爱人的照片，另外还有一张有五六个裸体男女赤条条地偎倚在一张大床上。威廉·威尔诺尔解释说：这是他和几个伙伴在日本和几个日本女人照的。威廉·威尔诺尔是美国加里福尼亚大学的学生，从他的说话里可知他似乎还没有丧尽良心，但是他却拍出这下流的照片，而且在被人看到的时候，竟毫不以为耻。这就使我们不难理解麦克阿瑟怎样把日本和朝鲜当作美军宣泄兽欲的场所，怎样用荒淫的兽性维系士气：“所有的姑娘就都是你们的了！”
    记者又曾接触了个名叫泼尔·Ｂ·鲁卡斯（Pearl.B.Lucas）的外科军医，记者问他：“就你自己来说，你为什么要到朝鲜来参加战争？”他答道：“假若我没有来，恐怕我已经被关进了监牢！”
