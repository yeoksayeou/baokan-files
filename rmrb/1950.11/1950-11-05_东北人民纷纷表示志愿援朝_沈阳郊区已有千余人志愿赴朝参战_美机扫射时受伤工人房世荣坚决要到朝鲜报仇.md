Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 4th: The people of Northeast China have reached the limit of their tolerance for the brutal acts of the American aggressive war. Many workers, farmers, and students have expressed their willingness to go to Korea to participate in the Korean People's Liberation War, resolutely resist American aggression, and defend the country. Farmers in the suburbs of Shenyang believe that with robbers at the door, they cannot sit idly by. Only by quickly helping the affected neighbors and driving away the aggressive robbers can they live a good life. More than 1,300 people in the villages of the suburbs have volunteered to participate in the Korean People's Liberation War. Many other farmers are preparing carts and horses, willing to go to the Korean battlefield to participate in rescue and transportation work. Antung Airport worker Fang Shirong, who was injured by an American aircraft strafing attack, has now recovered from his injuries. He believes that the time for revenge has come and firmly insists on going to Korea to be a stretcher-bearer. Gao Kuiji, a transportation worker at the Jinzhou Railway Bureau in Liaoxi Province, tells everyone he meets, "The American bandits are brutally massacring the Korean people and constantly provoking our country. I really can't stand it anymore and must go to Korea to participate in the war, dedicating everything to the Korean people and the security of the motherland." Jinzhou middle school girl student Liu Manchun, Liaoxi Provincial Health School students Jin Yuzhang and Wang Yongzhuang, Provincial Hospital nurses Zhao Xien and Xing Lianhan, all expressed their willingness to join the Korean People's Army to do rescue and medical work. Lan Runtang, an old technical worker at the "April 1st" factory in Jilin Province, believes that supporting the Korean People's Liberation War is closely related to safeguarding the safety of our people. He expressed his indignant desire to go to Korea to fight the American aggressors. In the two counties of Jiaohe and Shulan, many farmers have automatically prepared wooden poles and ropes, made stretchers, in order to go to support the Korean People's Army.
