Workers in Anshan, Fushun, Shenyang, Benxi, Beijing, Tianjin and Other Places Write Letters
Expressing Their Determination to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea

    Anshan Iron and Steel Works Workers Express Determination to Produce More Steel to Strike the Enemy
    Respected Chairman Mao:
    U.S. imperialism is expanding its aggression against our neighbor Korea, repeatedly violating our country's airspace and territorial waters, bombing and strafing Andong and other places in our country, and occupying our Taiwan. Our country's security is under serious threat. All the workers and technicians in our factory are extremely resentful. In order to oppose the aggressive acts of U.S. imperialism and smash its attempt to expand the war, we have turned hatred into determination and enthusiasm into strength, united as one, and worked hard. In October, we exceeded the monthly production target by 16.10%. In terms of quality, the unqualified rate dropped to 4.1%. This is the highest record ever achieved since our factory started operations a year and a half ago. We hereby report this victory to the people of the whole country and guarantee that under your banner, we will contribute everything we have to produce more steel, resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and defend our new China.
      Ma Chengde, Director of Anshan Iron and Steel Works Steelmaking Plant, Shao Xianghua, Deputy Director and Engineer, Su Weimin, Deputy Director, Liu Zhimin, Secretary of the Party Committee, Wang Wenzao, Deputy Director of the Trade Union, Liu Zhongyao, Secretary of the Communist Youth League, Wu Jingquan, Deputy Engineer, and all workers and technicians.

    Labor Model Representatives from the Coal Capital Fushun Must Be Heroes in Both Production and Combat
    Respected Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu:
    The U.S. imperialist wolves are invading our neighbor Korea and want to enter our gate. The working people of Fushun can no longer tolerate it. We volunteer to go to Korea to help the Korean people defeat U.S. imperialism. In our production posts, we are labor models; on the battlefield, we will also be combat heroes. In short, we will do whatever the motherland needs us to do. If necessary, we will put down our picks and take up our guns to fight to the end to defend our good life and our motherland from anyone's invasion. Now, we still stick to our production posts and work harder to produce.
    Labor Model Representatives from the Coal Capital Fushun: Zhang Zifu, Duan Zhongzhu, Wei Guojun, Liu Jinliang, Zhang Xiuying

    Shenyang Smelter Presents Production Triumphs to the Chinese and Korean People Fighting Side by Side
    Respected Chairman Mao:
    We, the entire staff and workers of Shenyang Smelter, are here to report good news to everyone. As of today, our plant's production of blister copper, electrolytic copper, electrolytic gold (self-smelted), and electrolytic silver has all been completed and exceeded the 1950 planned targets:
    Blister Copper Completed the Annual Target                  117.06%
    Electrolytic Copper Completed the Annual Target                  100.05%
    Electrolytic Gold (Ore Produced) Completed the Annual Target        107.39%
    Electrolytic Silver Completed the Annual Target                  148.60%
    Just as the People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army are fighting side by side and achieving brilliant victories, we use this achievement to express our determination to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and defend our homeland. These achievements are the result of the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party, government, trade union, and youth league at all levels, as well as the continuous learning, research, and technological improvement of all workers, technicians, and staff members with a sense of ownership.
    Today, U.S. imperialist aggression has seriously threatened the survival of our motherland. Our achievements are not enough. We still have many shortcomings (lack of business management skills), and there are still many difficulties in completing this year's lead production task (shortage of raw materials). But we are determined to overcome these shortcomings and difficulties, and we must also humbly do a good job in business management, improve the metal recovery rate, and strive to complete the annual electrolytic lead task before December 15, even overcoming all the difficulties regarding raw material shortages. At the same time, we are prepared to resolutely follow the Communist Party even in the more difficult times ahead, defend the factory, maintain production, and complete every task given to us by the motherland.
                                                    Sincerely,
    Greetings
                            Shenyang Smelter All Workers, Technicians, and Staff

    Workers of the Pottery Workshop of Benxi Coal and Iron Company Can No Longer Tolerate the Brutal Aggression of U.S. Imperialism
    Dear Comrade Mao Zedong:
    In recent years, thanks to your wise leadership and the heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army, we have truly gained freedom and democracy and have been liberated, and our lives are gradually moving towards brightness and happiness. We are happily moving forward, but unexpectedly, U.S. imperialist planes invading Korea have repeatedly invaded our northeastern airspace, killing and wounding many of our compatriots and destroying many of our buildings. We have already suffered from the oppression of imperialism and the exploitation of feudal forces, and we can no longer tolerate the madness and inhumane aggression of U.S. imperialism. This aggressive atrocity of U.S. imperialism has aroused a surge of anger in us. We have already held an anti-aggression meeting. At the meeting, everyone expressed their determination to work hard to produce and defeat the mad aggression of U.S. imperialism. At the same time, we responded to Zhao Guoyou's call and launched a friendly patriotic labor competition with workshops and mines in Benxi, and we challenged Zhao Guoyou's workshop. In order to defend every inch of the motherland's land and defend world peace, we will work hard to complete the tasks given to us by the state one month ahead of schedule.
                          Sincerely,
    Greetings
                      All Staff of the Pottery Workshop, Refractory Material Plant, Benxi Coal and Iron Company

    Workers of the Second Branch of Beijing Machine Factory Speed Up Production to Participate in the Anti-American Struggle
    Respected Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu:
    The American aggressors are frantically intensifying the war of aggression against Korea like wild beasts, and they are burning the flames of war to the border of our motherland. Recalling the Chinese People's War of Liberation, the guns and bullets made by the United States killed countless outstanding sons and daughters of our motherland. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and you, the entire Chinese people defeated the running dog Chiang Kai-shek and expelled its master, the American aggressor, from our territory; however, the American aggressor is brutally slaughtering the Korean people, who are our flesh and blood brothers, in our neighboring country of Korea, sending planes to strafe and bomb our Northeast, harming our people, invading our territory of Taiwan, supporting the dying bandit Chiang, and even sending spies and enemy agents to sneak into our territory in an attempt to sabotage our construction and try to follow the old path of Japanese imperialism to enslave our Chinese people. These bloody facts have taught us that we absolutely will not allow the American aggressors to sabotage our industry; nor will we allow them to slaughter our Chinese people and all the people of Asia! We resolutely support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Korea and support them in stopping the spread of the war of aggression and smashing the dog heads of the American aggressors!
    We guarantee that we will resolutely obey your leadership, resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of our working class to speed up production, complete the tasks assigned to us by the state; and we will heighten our vigilance, monitor the activities of bad elements, consolidate social security, and support the common struggle of the Chinese and Korean peoples against American aggression! We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and you, victory belongs to us! Greetings
                            All Workers of the Second Branch of Beijing Machine Factory

    Workers of Tianjin Hengda Flour Mill are Willing to Contribute All Their Strength to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea
    Respected Chairman Mao:
    Under your wise leadership, we have been liberated and embarked on the road of restoring and developing production. As we are resolutely striving to achieve a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation and working hard to consolidate and defend world peace today, the evil U.S. imperialists have stretched out their bloody hands to invade our Taiwan, send planes to invade our airspace to strafe and bomb; and even directly send troops to frantically invade Korea, attempting to burn the flames of a war that destroys humanity to the border of our Northeast and expand its aggressive acts. This bloody fact of U.S. imperialism has harmed the Korean people, threatened our country's security, and undermined peace in Asia and the world. We believe that Korea is our friendly neighbor, with whom we share common interests and are closely linked. We must not stand idly by while imperialism is invading Korea, and we must not stand idly by while imperialism threatens our country's security and undermines world peace!
    We guarantee to you that we will turn our anger into strength, treat machines as weapons to strike the enemy, stick to the front line of production, launch a warm patriotic production competition, guarantee to complete and exceed the glorious task of producing 510,000 bags of flour in the fourth quarter of this year, and use our practical actions to win victories on the production front forever, contribute all our strength, enthusiastically assist the Korean people, resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism, and fight to the end for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, strengthening national defense, and defending world peace!  We wish you good health
                                    All Employees of Publicly Operated Tianjin Hengda Flour Mill

　　鞍山抚顺沈阳本溪京津等地职工写信
    向毛主席表示抗美援朝决心
            鞍山炼钢厂职工表示要多生产钢打击敌人敬爱的毛主席：
    美国帝国主义扩大侵略我邻邦朝鲜，一再侵犯我国领空、领海，轰炸扫射我安东等地，并占领我台湾。我国安全受到严重威胁。我厂全体职工、技术人员万分痛恨。为了反对美帝的侵略行为，粉碎美帝扩大战争的企图，我们把仇恨变成决心，把热情变成力量，团结一致，埋头苦干，在十月份已超过该月生产任务百分之一六·一○，质量方面，不合格率降低到百分之四·一。这是我厂开工一年半以来从未达到过的最高纪录。我们谨将这一胜利报告给全国人民，并保证在您的旗帜下，贡献我们的一切，为多生产钢，抗美援朝，保卫我们的新中国而奋斗。
      鞍山钢铁公司炼钢厂厂长马成德、副厂长兼工程师邵象华、副厂长苏维民、党委书记刘志民、工会副主任王文藻、青年团书记刘忠耀、副工程师吴景铨暨全体职工及技术员。
            煤都抚顺的劳模代表生产打仗都要当英雄敬爱的毛主席、朱总司令：
    美帝饿狼侵略咱们的邻居朝鲜，还想跑进我们的大门。我们抚顺的劳动人民，再也不能忍受了。我们志愿到朝鲜去帮助朝鲜人民，打败美帝。在生产岗位上，我们是劳动模范；在战场上，我们也会是战斗英雄。总之，祖国需要我们作什么，我们就作什么。必要时，放下镐头，拿起枪杆，为保卫我们的美好生活、为保卫我们的祖国，不受任何人侵犯而战斗到底。现在，我们仍然坚守生产岗位，加倍努力生产。
    东北煤都抚顺劳模代表张子富、段忠珠、魏国钧、刘金良、张秀英
            沈阳冶炼厂以生产的捷报献给并肩作战的中朝人民敬爱的毛主席：
    我们沈阳冶炼厂全体职工向大家报捷，截至今日止，我厂粗铜、电铜、电金（自炼）电银等项生产，已经全部完成并超过了一九五○年的计划任务：
    粗铜完成全年任务                  一一七·○六％
    电铜完成全年任务                  一○○·○五％
    电金（矿石产）完成全年任务        一○七·三九％
    电银完成全年任务                  一四八·六○％
    正当人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军并肩作战获得辉煌胜利时，我们以此成绩表示抗美援朝、保家卫国的决心。这些成绩是在毛主席和各级党、政、工、团的英明领导之下，全体工人、技术人员、职员，以主人翁的态度，不断学习、钻研，并提高技术的成就。
    在今天，美帝侵略已严重地威胁到祖国生存。我们仅有这点成绩还不够。我们存在着的缺点还多（不会管理企业），要完成今年铅的任务还存在着很多困难（原料不足），但我们决心克服这些缺点、困难，还必须虚心地做好经营管理，提高金属实收率，并争取在克服一切原料不足的困难下，于十二月十五日前完成全年电铅任务。同时也准备即便在未来更坚苦的时期，我们也将坚决跟共产党走。保卫工厂，坚持生产，完成祖国给我们的每一件任务。
                                                    此致
    敬礼
                            沈阳冶炼厂全体工人、技术员、职员
            本溪煤铁公司陶器车间职工不能再忍受美帝的横暴侵略亲爱的毛泽东同志：
    几年来由于您的英明领导和人民解放军的英勇战斗，我们真正地得到了自由民主翻身解放，我们的日子也渐渐的走向光明幸福。我们正在高高兴兴的向前迈进着，不料美帝侵略朝鲜飞机屡次侵略我东北领空，杀伤我们许多同胞，炸毁我们许多建筑物。我们已经受过帝国主义的压迫和封建势力的剥削，我们再不能容忍美帝的疯狂和无人道的侵略。美帝的这种侵略暴行，激起了我们愤恨的怒潮。我们已举行了一次反侵略大会，在会上大家都表示要努力生产，好来打垮美帝的疯狂侵略。同时我们响应赵国有的号召，与本溪各场矿车间提出友谊爱国主义劳动竞赛，并向赵国有车间应战。我们为了保卫祖国每寸土地和保卫世界持久和平，我们就在工作上努力提前一个月来完成国家给我们的任务。
                          此致
    敬礼

            北京机器厂二分厂职工加紧生产参加反美斗争敬爱的毛主席和朱总司令：
    美国侵略者野兽一样地疯狂地加紧着侵略朝鲜的战争，并将战火燃烧到我们祖国的边疆。回忆在中国人民解放战争中，美国造的枪弹不知屠杀了多少我们祖国优秀儿女，全中国人民在中国共产党和您的英明领导下，打垮了走狗蒋介石，并将它的主子美国侵略者驱逐出我们的国土；但是，美国侵略者又在我们的邻邦朝鲜残暴地屠杀着我们骨肉相连的兄弟朝鲜人民，派遣飞机扫射轰炸我东北，伤害我人民，侵入我领土台湾，支持着就要死亡的蒋贼，还派遣间谍敌特潜入我领土妄图破坏我们的建设事业，并企图走日本帝国主义的老路子，来奴役我们中国人民。这些血的事实教育了我们，我们绝对不允许美国侵略者来破坏我们的工业；也绝对不允许它来屠杀我们中国人民及全亚洲人民！我们坚决拥护在朝鲜的中国人民志愿部队，拥护他们制止侵略战火的蔓延，打烂美帝侵略者的狗头！
    我们保证：要坚决服从您的领导，坚决拥护周外长的声明，发挥我们工人阶级的积极性和创造性，来加紧生产，完成国家给我们的任务；并提高警惕，监视坏分子的活动，巩固社会治安，以支援中朝两国人民反抗美国侵略的共同斗争！我们坚信在中国共产党和您的英明领导下，胜利是属于我们的！敬礼
                            北京机器厂第二分厂全体职工
            天津恒大面粉厂职工愿献所有力量抗美援朝敬爱的毛主席：
    我们在您的英明领导下，获得了解放，走上恢复与发展生产的道路。当我们正在坚决地为争取国家财政经济基本好转而奋斗、为巩固和保卫世界和平而努力的今天，万恶的美帝国主义伸出血淋淋的魔手，侵略了我们的台湾，遣派飞机侵入我国领空射击轰炸；更直接出兵疯狂的侵略朝鲜，企图把毁灭人性的战争烈火，燃烧到我们东北的边境，扩大其侵略行为。美帝国主义这种血腥的事实已经迫害了朝鲜人民，威胁了我国的安全，破坏了亚洲和全世界的和平。我们认为朝鲜是我们利害攸关唇齿相连的友邻，我们决不能任帝国主义对朝鲜的侵略而置之不理，决不能任帝国主义威胁我国的安全和破坏世界和平而置之不理！
    我们向您保证：我们一定要把愤怒化为力量，把机器当作打击敌人的武器，坚守在生产的战线上，展开热烈的爱国主义的生产竞赛，保证完成并超过本年第四季生产五十一万袋面粉的光荣任务，用我们在生产战线上永远打胜仗的实际行动，献出我们所有的力量，热忱的援助朝鲜人民，坚决的反对美帝国主义，一致为抗美援朝、加强国防建设、保卫世界和平而奋斗到底！  敬祝您身体健康
                                    公营天津恒大面粉厂全体职工
