Beijing Telecommunications Bureau Long-Distance Exchange Female Comrades Organize Service Team to Care for Families of Volunteers Aiding Korea

[Reported by our newspaper] Female comrades of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau's Long-Distance Exchange, in the movement to Resist America and Aid Korea, have organized a service team to care for the families of comrades from the exchange who are volunteering to Resist America and Aid Korea, highly demonstrating the spirit of mutual aid and friendship among comrades. Zhang Rixuan, Yang Rufang, and Song Guangmei, three female comrades from the exchange, have already left to work in the Northeast. Some of them have mothers and sisters at home, one has a family in Hangzhou, and one is a bride who had just been married for five days. The comrades of the Long-Distance Exchange usually care for each other, and as soon as these three decided to leave, someone immediately proposed organizing a service team to take care of their families. Eleven people volunteered to join the service team. They said, "We will not only do the work they left behind, but also take on the glorious task of serving their families."

The service team first established several work plans: 1. Collect and deliver wages and all funds for the families of the departing comrades (a portion of their salaries has been designated for household expenses). 2. Purchase food and supplies from the cooperative, and be responsible for contacting, notifying, or purchasing and delivering on their behalf. 3. Provide care during illnesses. 4. Organize recreational activities and write letters on their behalf. Following this, they spoke with the departing comrades step by step to understand the detailed situation of their families. They also contacted the finance department and the cooperative to make preparations. Recently, the service team decided to recruit comrades living in the dormitory to participate so that families can easily contact them by phone if something happens at night. They are also planning to make two visits at mid-month and the end of the month.

On the 19th of this month, the comrades of the service team took advantage of their day off to visit Song Guangmei's home. Her mother greeted them excitedly, saying, "Guangmei has been gone for four days. I always think of her, but when I think about resisting America and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, and that my daughter can serve the country, I am happy. One daughter has left, but so many of you comrades have come, and it's just like my daughter is still at home." The comrades of the service team said, "We work in the new society, and an organization is like a big family. What she can do at home, we can also do. If there is anything you need help with that we haven't thought of, just tell us, don't be afraid of bothering us, there are many of us and we can get things done quickly." Back at the exchange, the comrades of the service team discussed how to do this work well in the long term, and how to gain some experience to promote to other organizations. Because this brings great comfort and encouragement to the comrades who have left for work, to their families, and to those who are participating in this work. They excitedly felt that they had done their part in the work of resisting America and aiding Korea.

　　京电信局长途台女同志组织服务队
    照顾志愿援朝同志家属
    【本报讯】北京电信局长途台女同志，在抗美援朝运动中，组织服务队为该台志愿抗美援朝的同志照顾家属，高度发扬了同志间互助友爱的精神。该台有章日暄、杨如芳、宋光楣三个女同志已去东北工作。她们有的家里有母亲和妹妹，有的家在杭州，还有一个是刚结婚五天的新娘。长途台的同志们平素就互相关心，她们三个人一决定走，马上就有人提出要照顾她们的家属组织服务队。自愿报名参加服务队的有十一个人。她们说：“我们不仅要做好她们留下来的工作，还决定担起为家属服务的光荣任务。”
    这个服务队首先订了几条工作计划：一、为出发同志的家属领送工资和一切款项（她们的薪金已划定一部分交家用）。二、在合作社购办食用品，负责联络通知或代购代送。三、疾病照顾。四、联络文娱活动，代写书信。跟着就按步骤和出发同志讲话，了解她们家庭的详细情况。又跟财务科、合作社联系，做好准备工作。最近服务队决定吸收住宿舍的同志参加，以便家属夜晚有事好用电话联系。她们并准备在月半月终做两次访问。
    本月十九日那天，服务队的同志们，趁休假的日子，到宋光楣家里去访问。她母亲兴奋地接待着她们，说：“光楣出发已经四天了，刚刚走总有些念着，但一想到抗美援朝保家卫国，女儿能为国家办事，心里也就高兴了。走了一个女儿，来了你们这么多同志，还不是和我女儿在家一样。”服务队的同志说：“我们在新社会里工作，一个机关像一个大家庭一样，她在家里能做的事，我们也可以做。以后有要办的事，我们想不到的，您就说吧，不要怕我们忙，人多干起事来快。”回来，服务队的同志们互相谈论着：怎样长期的做好这件工作，怎样可以得些经验推广到别的机关去。因为这对出发工作的同志，对家属和参加这件工作的人，都有很大的安慰和鼓舞。她们兴奋地感到自己在抗美援朝的工作当中，已尽了一分力量。
