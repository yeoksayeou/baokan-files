Launching the Winter Production Campaign
　　Xing Yi

Following the national bumper harvest, launching an organized and led mass winter production campaign is an urgent and practical demand of the broad masses of farmers. Judging from the work arrangements before and after the autumn harvest in various regions, the winter agricultural production work has generally attracted the attention of leaders at all levels and has also achieved certain results, such as the sowing of winter crops such as wheat, barley, broad beans, and peas in winter crop areas; the sowing of green manure crops such as rapeseed, purple cloud alfalfa, and kochia scoparia in rice areas; and the winter plowing movement that is developing in many areas. However, some areas are content with this year's bumper harvest and neglect the leadership of winter production. Therefore, it is necessary to establish the idea of year-round agricultural production in the minds of cadres and fully understand the farmers' experience of "one year's farming for two years' work." The reason why the old liberated areas were able to restore or approach pre-war levels of cultivation and fertilization and achieve a bumper harvest this year is inseparable from the widespread mass winter production campaign last year. Therefore, leaders at all levels should be good at drawing on this experience, educating cadres to pay attention to the leadership of winter production, and in general areas, winter production should be the central task. In areas where land reform will be carried out this winter and spring, it should be well integrated with winter production, and important links in winter production should be grasped, concentrating efforts and repeatedly implementing them to achieve this goal well. What does the experience of a year of bumper agricultural production tell us? First of all, it is what we have gained through a series of efforts such as resolutely overcoming waterlogging, drought, and insect pests, intensive cultivation and fine work, applying more fertilizer to enhance soil fertility, and selecting superior varieties. Therefore, all the work that can be done in winter should be continued, such as:

　　1. Do a good job in farmland water conservancy work to overcome waterlogging and drought disasters. In areas with irrigation conditions such as canals, wells, ponds, and dams, vigorously organize the masses to build small-scale water conservancy irrigation projects, such as repairing ponds and dams and renovating existing canals; in mountainous areas, mobilize the masses to dig and dredge ponds to expand storage capacity; some large-scale water conservancy projects should also be thoroughly repaired by mobilizing the masses; actively organize and repair irrigation tools such as various waterwheels, and organize the masses to burn bricks and prepare materials for the construction of water conservancy projects this winter or spring; strengthen water conservancy management, organize rational water use, and expand the area of winter irrigation. Consolidate the drainage system, eliminate water accumulation, and expand the area of winter or spring planting; formulate next year's water conservancy plan, and fully prepare for surveying, materials, etc.

　　2. Carry out winter plowing to eradicate insect pests. Experience over the years has proved that winter plowing and deep plowing are not only important measures to increase soil fertility, but also a decisive key to eradicating insect pests. In areas with winter plowing habits, strive to plow all winter fallow land once and advocate deep plowing to retain moisture; especially in paddy field areas, plow and irrigate or expose to the sun. In areas without winter plowing habits, consult with the masses and organize implementation; in sandy and alkaline land or red and sticky land, organize the masses to turn the soil in combination with soil improvement. Pingyuan Juancheng, Shandong Laixi, Yena and other places have good experience, which is worth popularizing; in areas with serious insect pests, guide the masses to remove all rice stubble and straw stalks, field ridge weeds, etc. from the fields, and can generally mobilize women and children to collect insect eggs to reduce insect pests next year.

　　3. Launch a fertilizer accumulation campaign. Increasing fertilizer application is one of the important conditions for increasing agricultural production. Farmers are well aware of the principles of "fertile fields add grain, fertile pigs add meat" and "winter compares manure piles, autumn compares grain piles." Therefore, we should actively lead farmers to use the winter slack season to dig pond mud, pit mud, collect leaves, grass skins, and waste materials from animals and plants to manufacture a large amount of compost and pit fertilizer for use next spring. Help the masses open up fertilizer sources, such as improving toilets, advocating bedding circles, and fumigating wasteland, which can also be promoted according to local conditions. Last winter, North China, Northeast China, and the old liberated areas of Shandong Province, due to the leadership's grasp of this work, many areas accumulated 60 to 70 percent of the fertilizer used for spring plowing in winter. This experience is worth popularizing.

　　4. The preparatory work for spring plowing and spring sowing, such as the exchange, storage, and preservation of superior seeds, the preparation of pesticides, the protection and purchase of draft animals, and the repair of farm tools, are also important factors that determine the smooth progress of spring plowing next year and should be given full attention.

　　In short, agricultural production is a regular task, and it also has a strong seasonality. Therefore, we must pay attention to seizing the opportunity and not violating the agricultural season. All preparatory work that should be done in winter should not be delayed until next spring, and the overall goal of all this preparation is to overcome waterlogging, drought, and insect pests, cultivate intensively and meticulously, and strive for a greater bumper harvest next year.

　　Secondly, the experience of a year of leading farmers in production also tells us that agricultural production and sideline production are inseparable. In general areas, sideline production income often accounts for about 30% of farmers' income. If we do not pay attention to the leadership of sideline production, we will inevitably be separated from the masses. Especially in the old liberated areas, most areas paid attention to the leadership of sideline production in last winter's production, turning dead money into living money, using idle labor to carry out sideline production, and accumulating funds for agricultural production, purchasing vehicles and horses, and increasing the purchase of farm tools, fine fertilizer, and agricultural machinery and equipment, thus rapidly restoring and developing the production level that had been reduced by the war. Therefore, we must accept this experience this winter and pay attention to leading the masses to carry out sideline production and do a good job in supply and marketing. In sideline production, we must adopt a variety of sideline industries that are suitable for the time and local conditions. All kinds of production activities with raw materials and sales channels should be promoted in an organized and planned manner under the organization and leadership of supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels. At the same time, pay attention to mastering the principles of improving quality, reducing costs, and small profits but quick turnover; special attention should be paid to sideline production directly related to agricultural production, such as mobilizing and organizing the masses to open flour mills, tofu mills, and raise pigs and sheep to accumulate fertilizer; supporting and developing iron and wood industries, lime kilns, and brick kilns to prepare farm tools, bricks for well drilling, and lime for fertilizing fields; local processing of mountain products, specialties, and agricultural products, such as cotton ginning and oil extraction; vigorously develop the transportation industry, turning people raising livestock into livestock raising people to promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. This will make sideline production directly or indirectly prepare for agricultural production.

　　Carrying out the winter agricultural and sideline production campaign is a mass movement. Therefore, we must pay attention to implementing various policies that are conducive to production, exposing the rumors of bandits and secret agents, and dispelling the concerns of the masses in order to give play to the production enthusiasm of the broad masses and form a widespread mass movement. We must organize all the economic forces of the state, such as trade, banks, and cooperative systems, to vigorously support them in order to solve the difficulties in the production of the masses. At the same time, agricultural technicians should go to the countryside to summarize the experiences and creations of the masses and promote them in a timely manner to solve the technical difficulties of the masses. Only in this way can the winter production campaign be developed in a sound manner, and only in this way can we strive for one bumper harvest after another on the basis of this year's bumper harvest, and it is possible to prevent and overcome the possible spring famine in some disaster areas.

　　开展今冬生产运动
　　邢毅
    继全国丰收之后，开展一个有组织有领导的群众性的冬季生产运动，已是广大农民群众迫切的现实的要求。从各地秋收前后的工作布置中来看，冬季农业生产工作一般曾引起各级领导干部的注意，并且亦收到了一定的成绩，如冬作区的小麦、大麦、蚕豆、豌豆等冬季作物的播种；水稻区油菜、紫云英、萝苋子等绿肥作物的播种；不少地区正在发展着的冬耕运动。但还有些地区满足于今年的丰收，忽视冬季生产的领导，因此，必须在干部中树立农业生产贯串全年的思想，并充分体会农民的“一年庄稼两年作”的经验。今年老区耕作施肥水平所以能恢复或接近战前水平，并取得丰收，和去年广泛的群众性的冬季生产运动的开展是分不开的。因此各级领导要善于吸取这一经验，教育干部重视冬季生产的领导，在一般地区应以冬季生产为中心工作，在今冬明春进行土改地区，要很好和冬季生产相结合进行。并掌握冬季生产的重要环节，集中力量，反复贯彻。才能很好的实现这方针。一年来的农业生产的丰收经验告诉我们什么呢？首先就是我们曾坚毅地克服水旱虫灾，精耕细作，多施肥料增强地力，选用优良品种等一系列的努力所得到的。因此在这些工作中，凡在冬季可以进行的都要继续进行，如：
    一、作好农田水利工作，克服水旱灾害。凡有渠道、水井、塘坝灌溉条件的地区，要大力组织群众兴修小型水利灌溉工程，如修塘筑坝，整修现有渠道；在山区发动群众挖淘堰塘，扩大容水量，某些大型水利工程，亦应发动群众进行彻底的岁修；积极组织与修理灌溉工具如各种水车，并组织群众烧砖备料，为今冬或明春兴修水利之用；加强水利的管理，组织合理使水，扩大冬浇面积。整理排水系统，排除积水，扩大冬种或春种面积；拟定明年水利计划，充分作好勘测、物料等准备。
    二、开展冬耕，根除虫害。历年经验证明，冬耕深耕不仅是增加地力的重要措施，亦是根除虫害的决定关键。在有冬耕习惯地区，要争取冬季休闲地普耕一遍，并提倡深耕，以保水分；特别是水田区，要犁转灌水或暴晒，没有冬耕习惯的地区，要和群众商量，组织实施；在沙碱地，或红黏土地，组织群众翻地结合改造土壤，平原鄄城，山东莱西、掖南等地，都有很好的经验，值得推广；在虫灾严重地区，应指导群众把田里稻桩谷梗，田埂杂草，一律清除，并可普遍发动妇女儿童采拾虫卵，以减少明年虫害。
    三、开展积肥运动。增施肥料，为农业增产的重要条件之一，农民熟知“田肥加谷，猪肥加肉”，“冬天比粪堆秋天比粮堆”的道理，故应积极领导农民，利用冬闲，挖取塘泥，坑泥，收集树叶草皮以及动植物的废弃材料，大量制造堆肥，窖肥以备明春之用。帮助群众开辟肥源，如改良厕所，提倡垫圈，熏荒熏洞等方法，亦可因地制宜，加以提倡。去年冬季华北、东北、山东老区，由于领导上抓紧了这一工作，因而不少地区冬季积肥达春耕用肥的百分之六七十。这一经验值得推广。
    四、春耕春播的准备工作，如优良种子的调换，储藏保管，农药的准备，耕畜的保护添买，农具的修补等工作，亦是决定明年春耕顺利的重要因素，亦应充分注意。
    总之，农业生产是一件经常的工作，它又具有强烈的季节性，因此必须注意掌握时机，不违农时。凡是在冬天应作的一切准备工作，不要拖到明年春天，而这一切准备的总的目标，是战胜水旱虫灾，精耕细作，争取明年来个更大的丰收。
    其次，一年的领导农民生产的经验，亦告诉我们，农业生产和副业生产是不可分离的。一般地区副业生产收入往往占农民收入的百分之三十左右，如不注意副业生产的领导，必然脱离群众，特别是在老区，去年冬季生产中，大部地区注意了副业生产的领导，变死钱为活钱，利用农闲的劳力进行副业生产，积累了农业生产的资金，纷纷添车买马，增购农具、细肥、农用药械等，因而使被战争破坏而降低的生产水平，迅速的恢复并有些发展。所以今冬必须接受这一经验，注意领导群众进行副业生产，搞好供销工作。在副业生产上必须采取因时因地制宜，多种多样的副业，凡有原料有销路的各种生产活动，在各级供销合作社组织领导下，有组织有计划的加以提倡，同时注意掌握提高质量，降低成本，薄利广销的原则；特别应注意和农业生产直接有关的副业生产，如动员组织群众开粉坊、豆腐坊、养猪养羊以积肥；扶植与发展铁木工业、石灰窑、砖窑业以准备农具及打井用砖和肥田之石灰；山货特产农产就地加工，如轧花打油等；大力开展运输业，变人养牲口为牲口养人以促进城乡物资交流。这样使副业生产直接或间接为农业生产作好准备工作。
    开展冬季农副业生产运动，是个群众性的运动，因此必须注意贯彻各种有利于生产的政策，揭破土匪特务造谣，解除群众顾虑，才能发挥广大群众生产的积极性，才能形成为广泛的群众性运动。必须组织国家一切的经济力量，如贸易、银行合作等系统大力扶持，才能解决群众生产中的困难，同时农业技术人员应下乡总结群众经验与创造，及时推广以解决群众在技术上的困难，只有这样才能把冬季生产运动健全地开展起来，亦只有如此，才能在今年丰收的基础上，争取一个再一个的丰收，并可能防止和克服部分灾区可能发生的春荒。
