　　Capital's Literary and Art Circles Hold Symposium on "The Fall of Berlin"
    American Imperialism is Following Hitler's Path to Destruction
    [Our Newspaper] To celebrate the 33rd anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution, the Central Film Bureau and the Soviet Film Export Company specially selected the film "The Fall of Berlin," which will be screened in fourteen major cities across the country from November 7th. A grand preview reception was held at 2:00 PM on October 4th. The attendees included staff from the Film Bureau's Distribution Department, the Soviet Film Export Company's representative in China, Wu Kewen, and figures from China's art, literature, and journalism circles, including Ding Ling, Xu Beihong, Zhong Dianfei, Wang Chaowen, Lin Danqiu, Zang Kejia, Wu Xue, Jin Shan, Wang Shuming, Zhang Ding, and Lou Shiyi, totaling more than forty people.

    At the beginning of the symposium, Wu Kewen said: "During the anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution, the Soviet film 'The Fall of Berlin' is being shown in major cities in China; at the same time, 'The Victory of the Chinese People' is being screened in cities such as Moscow in the Soviet Union. This illustrates the close exchange of culture and art between China and the Soviet Union and demonstrates the close unity of the two countries in jointly opposing aggressors, which has profound significance."

    Wu Kewen then introduced the grand occasion of the screening of Chinese films in various Soviet cities during his recent return to the Soviet Union. He said: Films like "Daughters of China" were shown for many days in Moscow and other three cities and were widely welcomed by the Soviet people, which enabled the Soviet people to see the heroic struggle of the Chinese people against Japanese imperialism in the past. "The Invisible Front" and "Boundless Radiance" were also well received. It is expected that "The Victory of the Chinese People" will further enable the Soviet people to recognize and understand the history of the Chinese people's struggle and will be widely welcomed.

    Ding Ling, Xu Beihong, Zhong Dianfei, Wang Chaowen, and others successively shared their impressions, unanimously praising the film's beautiful colors, compact structure, and the outstanding artistic achievements of the actors and actresses. They all believed that every Soviet film has an enlightening effect on our creative methods. Like this film, which has such a great theme, it adopts such an expressive method—the development of the story's theme begins with the life of an individual, which is bold and can only be found in Soviet films. This technique makes people feel that it is very lifelike and very intimate, as if they are living inside it themselves. Other Soviet films, such as "Peaches and Plums All Over the World," have the same style. It fills people with ideals after watching it. Soviet films always educate people to move forward. It shows that the struggle of the Soviet people is to strive for the eternal peace of the Soviet Union and the people of the world, and to build a happy and fulfilling life for the people. Soviet art is sublime, reflecting the improved political life of the people. Their films have a high degree of unity in ideology and artistry. For example, in this film, the depiction of Stalin arriving in Berlin immediately after the fall of Berlin, although not the factual reality, artistically expresses what the audience desires in their hearts. Not limited to certain facts, but boldly creating on the basis of certain possible realities, this expression method is an outstanding achievement of Soviet films.

    Finally, everyone unanimously agreed that at a time when American imperialism is frantically invading Korea, "The Fall of Berlin" will clearly tell the audience: American imperialism is following Hitler's path to destruction, and victory will always belong to the just and peace-loving people of the world.

　　首都文艺界座谈“攻克柏林”
    美帝正走希特勒灭亡的老路
    【本报讯】为庆祝苏联十月革命三十三周年，中央电影局及苏联影片输出公司特选定了“攻克柏林”一片，从十一月七日起在全国十四个大城市先后放映，并于十月四日下午二时举行了隆重的试片招待会。出席招待会的有电影局发行处工作人员、苏联影片输出公司驻中国代表邬克文及我国艺术、文学、新闻各界人士丁玲、徐悲鸿、钟惦棐、王朝闻、林淡秋、臧克家、吴雪、金山、王淑明、张仃、楼适夷等四十余人。
    座谈开始时，邬克文说：“当苏联十月革命纪念日的时候，在中国各大城市演出苏联影片“攻克柏林”；与此同时，在苏联莫斯科等城内则放映“中国人民的胜利”，这说明了中苏两国文化艺术的密切交流，表现了两国紧密的结合在一起，共同反对侵略者，其意义是深长的。”
    邬克文继而介绍了他这次返苏在苏联各城市中所看到中国影片上映的盛况。他说：像“中华女儿”在莫斯科等三个城市连演多日，受到苏人民普遍的欢迎，它使苏人民看到了过去中国人民与日本帝国主义的英勇斗争。“无形的战线”与“光芒万丈”也得到好评。预料“中国人民的胜利”将会更进一步的使苏联人民认识并了解中国人民的斗争历史而得到广大的欢迎的。
    丁玲、徐悲鸿、钟惦棐、王朝闻等相继说了各人的观感，一致盛赞本片色彩的优美，结构的紧凑，以及职演员杰出的艺术成就。均认为：苏联每一部影片对我们创作的方法上都有着启示的作用。像本片有着这么伟大的主题思想，竟采用这样的表现方法——由个人的生活开始展开了故事主题的发展，这是大胆的，只有在苏联的影片上才找得出的手法。这种手法，使人感到它非常生活化，非常亲切，就像自己也生活在里面了。苏联其他的影片像“桃李满天下”也具有同样的作风。使人看了以后，充满了理想，苏联片永远是教育着人们前进的。它说明了苏联人民的斗争为的是争取永恒的苏联的和全世界人类的和平，是为了人民幸福的美满的生活的建设。苏维埃的艺术是崇高的，反映着人民已经提高了的政治生活，他们的影片在思想性与艺术性上有着高度的统一，例如本片中描写斯大林在攻克柏林之后即到了柏林，事实上虽非如此，但在艺术上表现了这点，却正合乎观众心中的愿望。不局限于一定事实，而在一定可能的现实基础上大胆创造，这种表现方法是苏联影片的杰出成就。
    最后大家一致认为：正当今日美帝疯狂的侵略朝鲜之际，“攻克柏林”会明确的告诉观众：美帝正走希特勒灭亡的老路，胜利将永远属于正义与爱好和平的世界人民。
