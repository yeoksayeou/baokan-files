Jinzhou Middle and Primary School Teachers and Students
Organize Propaganda Teams to Go Deep into the Masses
Deepen Hatred, Contempt, and Disdain for American Imperialism

[Report from this newspaper] Teachers and students from middle and primary schools in Jinzhou have formed five propaganda brigades to promote the significance and importance of resisting America and aiding Korea to the masses. During the initial nine days of propaganda work, through holding large meetings, courtyard meetings, door-to-door visits, helping with work, and explaining to the masses with maps and cartoons, they helped the masses raise their awareness and further recognize the ferocious face of American imperialism, its shameless atrocities of aggression against the Korean people, the Chinese people, all Asian people, and even the people of the world, and the strength of the world's peace and democracy camp. The citizens have expressed their determination to actively support the Korean people, defend their homes and country, and oppose American imperialist aggression.

The propagandists themselves also received a great education by listening to the old folks recounting their personal suffering from past oppression during the propaganda process. They have established good initial friendships with the masses.

Although this propaganda campaign has generally achieved two to four rounds of publicity, there are still a few households and individuals who have been missed, as well as omissions where publicity should have been conducted but was not. Currently, in addition to conducting publicity in areas that have not yet been covered, each propaganda team is using materials such as the "Joint Declaration of Various Democratic Parties" and the "Publicity Outline" from this newspaper's reprinted handbook on current affairs to continue to comprehensively promote the defense of the home and country to the citizens. At the same time, in conjunction with this work, they are focusing on explaining the significance of actively purchasing the Northeast Region's second phase of 1950 Production and Construction Indexed Bonds to those who hold idle funds and to industrialists and businessmen in order to oppose American imperialist aggression.

　　锦州市中小学校师生
　　组织宣传队深入群众
    加深对美帝仇视鄙视蔑视
    【本报讯】锦州市中、小学教员、学生，组成五个宣传大队，向市民群众宣传抗美援朝的意义及其重要性。起初九天的宣传中，通过开大会、大院会、串门访问，帮助干活，带着地图、漫画给群众讲解等方式，使群众提高了觉悟，更加认识了美帝国主义的凶恶面目，它对朝鲜人民、中国人民、全亚洲以至全世界人民进行侵略的无耻暴行，和世界和平民主阵营力量的强大等问题。市民们都表示了积极支援朝鲜人民，保家卫国，反对美帝侵略的决心。
    宣传员们，由于在宣传中听老乡们诉说了他们过去被压迫的切身苦痛，自己也得到了很大的教育。他们已和群众初步建立了良好的朋友关系。
    这次宣传虽然普遍地做到了宣传二次至四次，但是仍有少数遗漏户和遗漏的人，以及应宣传没有宣传的遗漏问题。现在各宣传队除向未宣传到的地方进行宣传外，并以“各民主党派联合宣言”和本报转载时事手册的“宣传提纲”等为宣传材料，继续全面地向市民进行保家卫国的宣传。同时结合这一工作，重点地对握有游资的人们和工商业者说明为了反对美帝侵略，应积极购买东北区一九五○年度下期生产建设折实公债的意义。
