　　A Trip to Dihua - Yanqi - Korla

    A great plan to transform nature—to complete irrigation of five million mu of land in Xinjiang within three years—is being executed precisely.

    Departing from Dihua, we drove across the bridge over the Kaidu River outside Yanqi city. After a stretch of highway, the car turned right onto a newly built dirt road. On both sides lay vast expanses of wilderness, tall with cogongrass and reeds. Without water, this land had remained barren.

    Ahead, countless People's Liberation Army soldiers were happily digging earth, constructing the South Main Canal of the Kaidu River. They clearly understood that their hard work would increase Xinjiang's cultivated land, produce more grain, more cotton, plant alfalfa, and graze more cattle and sheep. They were working for themselves and for the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Just as they clearly knew during the war that eliminating the enemy was the only way to preserve themselves, they knew that only through labor and production could they take root in Xinjiang, strengthen the country's economic power, and make Xinjiang the great rear base of the People's Republic of China. Such an army is invincible; it will defeat any imperialist aggression.

    I remember at a symposium with Xinjiang delegates attending the National Congress of Combat Heroes and Model Workers, the combat heroes and model workers made such promises:

    "As long as there is a company, a hundred people, and those who have studied draw us a picture, we can complete any construction project."

    The selfless collective heroism of these many soldiers working before our eyes is the realization of this promise.

    The engineers have already determined the plan to build the highway and dirt road on both sides of the canal in one go. Two rows of willows and fruit trees will be planted on both sides of the canal, and experts in road construction, horticulture, and water conservancy will be integrated to complete the project at once.

    Wooden stakes have been erected on the highway, and ropes are stretched between them, indicating the height of the highway; the roadbed of the highway along the completed canal has been laid flat.

    Let's calculate the numbers for this project:

    The 81-kilometer-long canal, along with the highways and dirt roads on both sides, covers approximately 3,000 mu of land. After the canal is completed, it can irrigate 1.5 million mu of land.

    The earthwork volume is approximately 6 million cubic meters.

    Each person can dig an average of four to five cubic meters of earth per day, and with the roadbed and dirt road, each person can do approximately 2.5 cubic meters of earthwork per day.

    The entire project requires 2.4 million person-days of labor.

    The total wages are 1.2 million yuan in silver.

    This sum will be distributed to all the commanders and fighters participating in the labor, added to the cooperative, and shares issued to each person. The funds will be deposited in the state bank as an investment in the state's water conservancy事业, with annual interest paid as water fees to the state.

    The soldiers are resting, waiting for the meal. The cooks carry the food from the garrison, several or even more than ten li away, ensuring that the soldiers can eat hot meals. Two dishes with plenty of oil, and three to four jin of meat can be eaten each month. The days of just eating rice with salt water and filling the stomach with corn when they first arrived in the garrison this spring when vegetables were scarce and food was difficult have passed. After half a year of hard production, they now have enough grain and vegetables.

    The cook proudly said, "Besides the vegetables we've eaten, we still have more than 10,000 jin of cabbage and more than 10,000 jin of potatoes. We can't finish the vegetables."

    During the ten minutes of free time while waiting for the meal to be served, some soldiers took out notebooks and fountain pens, sitting on the grass to review the new characters they had just learned yesterday; some gathered around to look at the small wall newspapers made by the soldiers themselves (there were no walls on the wasteland, so the drafts were pasted on cloth curtains, supported by bamboo poles by the side of the canal). Here were praise, encouragement, and criticism, diaries written by the soldiers themselves, thoughts, clappers, and even papers.

    This shows that eliminating illiteracy in the troops within three years and universally improving the cultural level of the troops is entirely possible.

    A company of soldiers started dancing the Uyghur folk dance. More than a dozen soldiers danced, and the rest sang dance music. They used various methods to recover from fatigue in labor.

    From Yanqi to Korla, passing through the Iron Gate Pass, the Kongque River water is crystal clear, and the rapids flow through the mountains. The beauty of this river can be imagined from the name "Kongque River" (Peacock River).

    Due to the construction of the South Main Canal, the water of the Kaidu River will be diverted into the Kongque River, increasing the water level of the Kongque River and accelerating the water flow, which will double the hydroelectric power generation at the Iron Gate Pass. A huge hydroelectric power plant can be built here.

    The Dadunzi Canal in Korla is being built entirely in the desert area. Sometimes, in order to bypass the houses and graves of local residents, a section of road has to be dug. In the solid sandy ground, the pickaxe is the best tool.

    This year, the canal will be dug through. Next year, water will be introduced, and when the land is planted, new houses can be built one after another. When the hydroelectric power plant is built, it will develop into a new city.

    The South Main Canal and the Dadunzi Canal will be respectively named Liberation First Canal and Liberation Second Canal to commemorate the hard work of the People's Liberation Army.

    The highway from Dihua to Kashgar is also under construction.

    This reminds us of the famous novel "Time, Forward!" by Kataev, describing the construction of Magnitogorsk in the first year of the first five-year plan in the Soviet Union. The situation before Magnitogorsk was built:

    "A year and a half ago, this was completely a wilderness - a wild, arid steppe, uninhabited, with lifeless mountains, eagles, blizzards, 150 kilometers from the nearest railway line, and 50 kilometers from the nearest town."

    Under the guidance of Stalin's thought that "reducing speed means falling behind, and those who fall behind will be beaten," the great Soviet people built a socialist city in the wilderness, and concrete workers launched a competition to break world records.

    Although our situation is different, it is very similar.

　　迪化——焉耆——库尔勒记行
    一个伟大的改造自然的计划——三年内在新疆完成灌溉五百万亩地的水利工程——正在准确地执行着。
    从迪化出发，坐着汽车经过了焉耆城外开都河上的大桥，走了一段公路，汽车向右拐入新辟成的大车路，两边是一大片荒原，芨芨草和芦苇长得高高的，没有水，这些地一直是荒芜着。
    前面有无数解放军的战士们在愉快地挖土，兴修开都河的南大渠。他们清楚地知道由于他们辛勤的劳作，将使新疆增加耕地面积，生产更多的粮食，更多的棉花，种植苜蓿草，牧放更多的牛羊。他们是在为自己、为新疆的各族人民劳动着。他们如同在战争中清楚地知道消灭敌人才能保存自己一样地知道只有劳动生产才能在新疆扎下根，强大国家的经济力量，使新疆成为伟大中华人民共和国的大后方。这样的一支军队是无敌的，它将战胜任何帝国主义的侵略。
    记得在一次出席全国战斗英雄劳动模范代表会议的新疆代表座谈会上，战斗英雄劳动模范们曾说着这样的诺言：
    “只要有一个连队，一百个人，念书的给我们画了图，什么建设工程我们都能完成。”
    眼前这许多战士们忘我的集体英雄主义的劳作，就是这个诺言的实现。
    工程师们已经把渠道两边的公路和大车道一次修好的计划都规定好了。渠的两边要栽二排柳树和果树，还要把修路的、园艺的科学和水利的专家结合起来，使工程一次完成。
    公路已树立了木标，两边拉着绳子，表示出公路的高度；在已完工的渠道边公路路基已铺得平平整整的了。
    计算一下这工程的数字吧：
    八十一公里长的渠道，连那两旁的公路和大车道占地约三千亩。渠道修成后能灌溉一百五十万亩地。
    起土方约为六百万立方公尺。
    每人每天平均能挖四、五个立方公尺的土方，连带做好公路路基和大车道每人每天约为二·五立方公尺的土方。
    全部工程需二百四十万人一天的劳动。
    全部工资为一百二十万现洋。
    这笔款子将分给全体参加劳动的指战员，加入合作社，发给每人股份，款项存入国家银行作为向国家水利事业的投资而以每年的利息支付应向国家缴纳的水费。
    战士们休息了，他们等待着开饭。炊事员把饭菜从数里以至十余里的驻地挑来，他们保证战士们能吃到热饭。两个菜，油量很充足，每月还能吃到三、四斤肉。今年春天刚到驻地时菜蔬缺乏，粮食困难，只能用盐水下饭，以包谷充饥的日子已经过去了，半年来辛勤的生产，现在他们已有足够的粮食和菜蔬。
    炊事员骄傲地说：“除了吃掉的菜不算，我们还有一万多斤白菜，一万多斤洋芋，菜都吃不完。”
    在这准备开饭的十几分钟空闲中，战士们有的掏出笔记本和水笔，坐在草地上复习昨天刚学会的生字，有的围着看战士们自己编的小墙报（荒地上没有墙，稿子便贴着布幔上，用竹杆支在渠道边），这里有着表扬、鼓励和批评，战士们自己写的日记，感想，快板以至于论文。
    这说明了在三年内消灭部队中的文盲，普遍提高部队的文化水平是完全可以做到的。
    有一连的战士们跳起维吾尔的民族舞来了，十多位战士们跳着舞，其余的唱着舞曲。他们用各种方式来恢复劳动中的疲劳。
    从焉耆到库尔勒去，经过铁门关，孔雀河水清澈见底，急湍在大山中间流过。“孔雀河”从这个名字中便可以想像这条河水的美丽了。
    由于南大渠的兴修，将引开都河的水流入孔雀河，使孔雀河的水位增高，水流加速，铁门关的水力发电便可增高一倍。这里可以建设巨大的水力发电厂。
    库尔勒的大墩子渠是完全在沙漠地带兴修的。有时为了绕过当地居民的房屋、坟墓而不能不挖掘一段公路。结实的沙地，十字镐成为最好的工具。
    今年把渠道挖通，明年引进水来，种上了地，就可以砌起一幢一幢的新房子，将来水电厂修起来，就会发展为一个新的城市。
    南大渠和大墩子渠将分别定名为解放第一渠和解放第二渠以纪念人民解放军的辛勤劳作。
    迪化通喀什的公路也在动工了。
    这使我们记起了苏联卡泰耶夫描写第一个五年计划中的第一年玛格尼托高尔斯克建设情形的有名的小说《时间啊，前进！》玛格尼托高尔斯克城未建设前的情形：
    “一年半前，这里完全是一片荒漠——一片荒野焦燥的大草原，没有人烟，没有一点活气的山、鹰鸟、暴雪，离最近的铁路线有一百五十公里，离最近的市镇五十公里。”
    伟大的苏维埃人民在斯大林“减低速度就是落后的意义，而落后的人便被挨打”这样的思想指导下，在荒漠地区建设了社会主义的城市，混合土工人发动着打破世界纪录的竞赛运动。
    我们的情况虽然不同，但也是十分相似的。
    一九五○年十一月一日于迪化
