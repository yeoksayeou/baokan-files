The suffering of overseas Chinese residing in the United States due to the hostility, oppression, and persecution of American imperialists did not begin today. The history of overseas Chinese in the United States is a history of bitterness and tears. Especially after the American imperialists' aggressive forces in China were defeated by the Chinese people, they harbored a vengeful mentality, and the persecution of overseas Chinese intensified. Some who are not very clear think that overseas Chinese live a comfortable life in the United States, but in fact, as long as we pay a little attention to the newspapers and listen to the narrations of returned overseas Chinese, we will know how they suffer inhuman treatment.

Although American imperialists shamelessly boast of being a "democratic" country, they do not grant freedom and democratic rights to either the American people or foreigners. To say nothing else, just their despicable treatment of the local overseas Chinese democratic newspapers shows what so-called democracy and freedom are all about. The Jinmen Overseas Chinese Newspaper and the Zhongxi Daily published in San Francisco, and the Overseas Chinese Daily published in New York, are democratic newspapers run by righteous people among the overseas Chinese in the United States. They have always stood on the side of people's democracy, calling on overseas Chinese to unite, oppose the crimes of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, love the motherland, support world peace and democracy, and expose the imperialists' conspiracy to provoke a world war. Therefore, they have a high reputation among overseas Chinese and have a wide readership. However, the American imperialist government wants to forcibly impose the crime of "red newspapers," forcing them to register and be recognized as communist newspapers, in order to suppress them. At the same time, they instigated local Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents and hooligans to intimidate and attack news vendors selling these three newspapers. On the other hand, they ordered businesses not to publish advertisements in the newspapers, threatening and intimidating people not to subscribe, attempting to strangle them economically and in terms of sales, viciously trying to deceive the overseas Chinese so they can be slaughtered and bullied at will.

The American imperialists not only treat the press in this way, but also do not tolerate ordinary overseas Chinese who love democracy and care about the world's political situation. As long as you are discovered to have this kind of "illegal" behavior, you are in danger of being deported, arrested, sanctioned, or imprisoned. Especially after the American imperialists suffered heavy losses in launching their aggression against Korea, they do not allow people to know or freely discuss it. In addition to a comprehensive and strict blockade of information, they also prohibit commentary in newspapers and periodicals. Shortly after the outbreak of the war, three students studying in the United States were immediately expelled by the American government on false charges of being communists because they reported and commented on the disastrous defeat of the American invading forces. Sometimes they even arbitrarily add fabricated charges and detain people. The unreasonable detention of scientist Dr. Qian Xuesen, Professor Zhao Zhongyao, and two students, Luo Shijun and Shen Shanjiong, on their way back to China from the United States is the most prominent example. Deportation and detention are determined by the whims of the American imperialists. The words of the imperialists are the law, and their will is the rule. Recent returnees, when talking about this situation, all indignantly said: Living in the United States is like living in a living hell. The American government has the freedom to persecute overseas Chinese anytime, anywhere; and overseas Chinese have the "freedom" to be persecuted anytime, anywhere. This is the so-called American-style freedom.

The American imperialists also inherited and promoted the old mantle of Hitler's fascist "superior race theory." The American imperialists boast that white people are the world's most "superior" race, and among people of color, yellow and black people are the most discriminated against (among white people, Jews, Italians, and Mexicans are discriminated against). The areas where white people and people of color live are strictly separated and not allowed to mix. Overseas Chinese have no freedom of residence in the local area: For example, overseas Chinese Li Jun was unreasonably discriminated against because he married an American, and even his lover was excluded and not allowed to live in the white area, because the marriage law stipulates that people of color are not allowed to marry white people. Overseas Chinese Zeng Jun bought a house in a white area near Chinatown in San Francisco, but he was not allowed to move in. Zeng Jun had to spend a considerable amount of money to sue in court, but the judge, who served the American imperialists, big consortia, and bureaucratic politicians, still ruled against Zeng Jun. The reason is that the area is a white area and cannot be lived in by yellow people. If you do not accept the judgment and move in, then white people will instigate thugs and hooligans to make trouble, dirty the walls, break the glass windows, and dump garbage in front of your house. Various rogue pranks make it impossible for you to appeal, and you have to leave. In the South, schools are segregated for black and white people; on Southern transportation, trains and buses, seats for black and white people are separated; other places such as swimming pools, entertainment venues, restaurants, and even toilets are also separated for black and white people.

This kind of racial discrimination is especially manifested in the treatment of the working class. The American Seafarers International Union has several thousand foreign seafarers, of which about two thousand are Chinese workers. During World War II, the seafarers bravely stood at the forefront of the struggle, and together with the American working class, made great efforts in the fight against fascism and established many meritorious deeds. This righteous and heroic behavior should have been rewarded and the original occupation should have been guaranteed; however, the cunning American imperialists promulgated a decree on June 31 of this year, prohibiting foreign (including Chinese) seafarers from doing their original work. The original overseas Chinese seafarers must have already joined American citizenship and have worked as seafarers for more than three years before they have the opportunity to continue working. The class consciousness of the seafarer comrades is very high. They clearly understand the fascist nature of the American government and know that the working class must be closely united in order to win improvements in their lives and complete liberation. Therefore, they often wage resolute and tenacious struggles against imperialist capitalists. For example, in September 1946 and 1948, the seafarers and dockworkers on the American West Coast launched two strikes demanding wage increases, which lasted for three months and resulted in victory. In the struggle, Chinese workers and other worker brothers fully demonstrated the heroic spirit of working-class unity and struggle.

The American Federation of Labor, controlled by American reactionaries, is essentially a reactionary trade union, so it also discriminates against people of color. It does not allow Chinese workers or other foreign workers to participate, attempting to create division within the working class.

Recently, the American imperialists have been rampant, stepping up the expansion of armaments, and the burden of all military spending undoubtedly falls on the American people. The American government, which represents big capitalists and big arms dealers, levies very heavy taxes on the American people. Overseas Chinese working locally, in addition to being brutally exploited, must also pay heavy so-called income taxes, regardless of whether their income can maintain their livelihood. Generally, the families of overseas Chinese live in the motherland and need overseas Chinese to send money home to support them. However, the American imperialists completely ignore this and force many overseas Chinese to pay taxes under the regulations for "no dependents," because the tax burden for people with no dependents is much heavier than for those with dependents. In this way, another layer of exploitation is added invisibly. The situation of overseas Chinese, as well as the threats of poverty, illness, and unemployment, make their hearts yearn for a strong and happy motherland.

Living in the United States is certainly subject to discrimination, oppression, and a painful life, but mentioning the abuse they suffered when they first entered the United States is even more infuriating. The U.S. State Department ordered U.S. consulates in Hong Kong and other ports to conduct strict inspections and unreasonable obstruction of Chinese people applying for entry. After being extorted for various handling fees and other expenses of $2,000 USD, it is still difficult to get the "approval" stamp. Even if you get the "approval" stamp, after landing in the United States, you will still be routinely locked up in the Immigration Bureau for a period of one week to one or two years, with very poor food and treatment. During this period, relatives and friends are not allowed to visit, there are many difficulties, and confessions are forced. In addition to asking what the names of relatives and friends are and why they came to the United States, even trivial questions such as whether the houses in China face east or west and what is written on the statues of gods at home are among the questions being asked. If there is the slightest wrong answer, the right to enter will be revoked. Sometimes, due to being imprisoned for too long, relatives and friends have to hire a lawyer to appeal and bribe hundreds of U.S. dollars to be allowed to enter. Therefore, cases of people developing mental illnesses, committing suicide, and dying from illness are often heard. In 1947, a female compatriot named Huang Lai came to the United States to find her husband and was detained and harassed by the U.S. Immigration Bureau, so she became disillusioned and attempted suicide. Recently, after the Chinese people achieved victory over the American Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in China, the American imperialists, who have always been hostile to the Chinese people, resolutely banned Chinese people from entering the country.

What is pointed out here are just some fragmented pieces. In fact, the events of overseas Chinese in the United States being oppressed, exploited, and expelled by the American imperialists are too numerous to count. Although the United States is stubbornly hostile to the Chinese people, the Chinese people have stood up, and the powerful motherland will certainly serve as a backing for overseas Chinese. And the overseas Chinese's hatred of American imperialism and their expression of boundless loyalty and love for the motherland are becoming stronger and stronger. The fact that batches of students studying in the United States have recently returned to the motherland with hatred for American imperialism to participate in the great construction work is clear evidence. As long as the broad masses of overseas Chinese unite closely, the various conspiracies, tricks, and vile means of imperialism to treat overseas Chinese can be completely shattered.

　　美国华侨的苦难
　　怒剑
    美帝国主义者仇视、压迫与迫害居留在美国的华侨，并不是自今日开始的。美国华侨的历史就是一部辛酸的血泪史。特别是美帝国主义者在中国的侵略势力被中国人民打垮后，他们就抱存着报复的心理，对华侨的迫害变本加厉了。一些不甚清楚的人，以为华侨在美国是过着安乐的生活，其实，只要我们稍为注意报章以及听见过归国侨胞的叙述，就知道他们是如何的遭受非人的待遇。
    美帝国主义者虽然厚颜无耻的自诩为“民主”国家，但是不论对美国人民或外侨都不给予自由民主的权利。别的不说，单就他们卑鄙的对待当地的华侨民主报纸，就知道所谓民主自由是怎样一回事了。在旧金山出版的金门侨报、中西日报和在纽约出版的华侨日报，是侨美正义人士办的民主报纸，一向站在人民民主的立场，号召侨胞团结起来，反对蒋匪罪行，热爱祖国，拥护世界和平民主，揭露帝国主义者挑拨世界大战的阴谋。因此在华侨中有很高的声誉，且拥有广大的读者。但是美帝政府竟欲强加以《红色报纸》的罪名，强迫登记承认为共产党报，以便加以扑灭；同时嗾使当地蒋匪特务流氓，恐吓打击贩卖这三家报纸的报贩，另一方面命令商家不准在该报登载广告，恐吓威胁人家不准订阅，企图从经济上和销路上来窒息它们，狠毒的想蒙蔽侨胞，好任其宰割欺凌。
    美帝不但对舆论界是如此，就是一般喜爱民主、关心世界政治形势的侨胞也不见容于美帝政府。只要你被发觉有这种“不法”行为，那么就有受驱逐、逮捕、制裁、监禁的危险。尤其是这次美帝发动对朝鲜的侵略所遭受惨重的损失，更不许人民知道或自由谈论。除了全面严格封锁消息外，还禁止在报刊上评论。当战事发生后不久，有三个留美学生，因报导评论美侵略军惨败，马上被美政府诬为共产党驱逐出境。有时甚至随意加上莫须有的罪名，扣押起来。科学家钱学森博士，赵忠尧教授和罗时均、沈善烱两个留学生，在由美回国途中被无理横加扣留就是最显著的事例。驱逐、扣押随美帝的欢喜而定。帝国主义者的话就是法律，意志就是条规。最近的归侨，谈论到这情况时，无不愤慨的说：住在美国犹如住活地狱，美国政府有随时随地迫害侨胞的自由；而侨胞有随时随地被迫害的“自由”，这就是所谓美国式的自由。    美帝还继承和发扬了希特勒法西斯的“优秀种族论”的旧衣钵。美帝自夸白种人是世界最“优秀”的种族，有色人种中，黄种人、黑种人是最被歧视的（白种人被歧视的有犹太人、意大利人和墨西哥人等）。白人与有色人居住的地域被严格分开，不容混杂。华侨在当地没有半点的居住自由：如华侨李君因与美国人结婚，就受到无理的歧视，连他的爱人也一起被排斥不准在白人地区居住，因婚姻法规定有色人种不准与白人结婚。华侨曾君在旧金山唐人街附近的白人区域买了一所住屋，但是不准他迁入居住。曾君不得不耗费相当多的金钱向法院起诉，但是为美帝国主义、大财阀、官僚政客服务的法官，却仍判决曾君败诉。理由是那地方是白人区域，不能给黄种人住。假如你不信服判决，迁入居住，那么白人就会教唆恶棍地痞来捣你的蛋，弄肮脏墙壁，击破玻璃窗，把垃圾倒在你的屋前。各种无赖的恶作剧弄得你有理无处申诉，不得不离开。在南方学校都是黑白人分校；南方交通工具，火车汽车上黑白人座位都是分开的；其他如游泳池，娱乐场所，饭店甚至厕所也分黑白人的。
    这种种族歧视，特别表现在对待工人阶级方面。美国海员工会有外侨海员几千人，其中华工约有两千人。在第二次世界大战时，海员们英勇的站在斗争的前列，与美国工人阶级一起在反对法西斯的战斗中，出了伟大的力量，建立了不少的功勋。这种正义英勇的行为理应得到应得的褒奖和有原来的职业的保障；但是狡诈的美帝，竟于本年六月三十一日颁布法令，不准外侨（包括华工）海员作原来的工作，原来的华侨海员，必须是已经加入美国籍，并做过三年以上海员的，才有继续工作的机会。海员工友们的阶级觉悟程度是很高的，他们清楚地了解了美国政府的法西斯本质，更知道了工人阶级必须紧密的团结起来，才能争得生活上的改善和彻底的解放。因此时常与帝国主义资本家进行坚决顽强的斗争。例如一九四六年九月间和一九四八年，美国西海岸海员工人，码头工人发动的要求加薪的两次罢工，都坚持了三个月之久，结果得到胜利。在斗争中，华工与其他工人兄弟充分表现出了工人阶级团结与斗争的英雄气概。
    在美国反动派操纵下的美国劳联（American Federation Of Labour）本质上是反动的工会，所以也是歧视有色人种的。它不准华工或其他外侨工人参加，企图造成工人阶级内部的分裂。
    最近美帝的兽性大发，加紧扩充军备，一切军费的负担无疑的是落在美国人民的身上。代表大资本家、大军火商人的美国政府，向美国人民勒收的税捐是十分繁重的。华侨在当地做工，除了惨受剥削外，不管你收入是否能维持生活也同样要缴纳很重的所谓所得税。一般华侨的侨眷是在祖国内生活，需要华侨汇款养家的。但是美帝完全不理你这些，强迫许多华侨以“无家眷”的条例交纳税款，因为无家眷的人的税项负担是比有家眷的人重得多的。这样，无形中又加上了一重剥削。华侨的这种处境，以及贫病失业的威胁，使他们的心都向往在强盛幸福中的祖国。
    居住在美国境内固然要受到歧视压迫和过着痛苦的生活，但是一提起他们初次进入美国境时所受虐待，更使人悲愤。美国国务院命令香港以及其各港口的美国领事馆，对于中国人申请入口进行严格的审查和无理的留难。被勒索了各种各样的手续费以及其他的用费二千元美金，还很难得到“准”字。就算得到“准”字，在美国登岸后，也要照例被锁禁在移民局之内，时间一星期至一两年不等，膳食待遇甚为恶劣。在此期间，不准戚友探问，诸多为难，迫问口供。除了盘问亲戚朋友什么名，为什么到美国来等外，连在中国居住的房屋是向东或向西，家中神像上写些什么——这样无聊的话也在被查问之列。如果有丝毫答错，便取消入口权。有时因被监禁太久，就要托戚友请律师上诉，贿赂几百美金才准进口。因此，发神经病，自杀病死者时有所闻。一九四七年有一个女同胞名叫黄来的，到美国找寻丈夫，被美国移民局扣留为难，因而厌世企图自杀。最近中国人民在中国对美蒋匪帮取得胜利后，一向仇视中国人民的美帝国主义者，就决绝的禁拒中国人民入境了。
    这里所指出的只是些零碎的断片，事实上，旅美华侨受美帝的压迫、剥削、驱逐等事件是罄竹难书的。美国虽然死硬的与中国人民为敌，但是中国人民已经站起来了，强大的祖国一定能作为侨胞的后盾的。而侨胞们对美帝国主义的嫉恶和对祖国表现无限忠诚和热爱也愈来愈坚强了。最近留美学生一批一批地满怀憎恨美帝的心情返回祖国，参加伟大的建设工作就是明证。只要广大的华侨紧密的团结起来，帝国主义的各种对待华侨的阴谋诡计，卑污手段是可以彻底粉碎的。
