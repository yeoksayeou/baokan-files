　　In Memory of Comrade Ren Bishi
    Wang Zhen
    The death of Comrade Ren Bishi, outstanding son of the great Chinese people, one of the earliest communists in China, and an eminent student and close comrade-in-arms of Comrade Mao Zedong, has deprived the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese People's Liberation Army of a staunch, tenacious, and long-tested brilliant leader, and the Chinese nation and the Chinese people of an outstanding statesman. As a Communist Party member who was personally under your leadership and tutelage, I mourn you with deep sorrow!
    As early as the Great Revolution of China from 1925 to 1927, Comrade Ren Bishi had a tremendous impact on the Chinese working people and the broad masses of young people. In 1931, at the First National Soviet Congress held in Ruijin, Jiangxi, Comrade Ren Bishi was the Minister of Organization of the Central Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party in the Central Soviet Area, then headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. I was the branch secretary of the Xianggan Soviet Area delegation attending this congress, and I was fortunate to meet you for the first time. You summoned me and inquired in detail about the struggles of the workers, peasants, and Red Army in the Xianggan Soviet Area. With the high enthusiasm of a Bolshevik organizer and educator, you transformed our delegation attending the National Soviet Congress into a training class. On the study schedule you prepared for our delegation, there were lectures by Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Comrade Zhou Enlai, and other comrades. Among them, you personally lectured on Party building.
    In May 1933, just as Chiang Kai-shek, aided by imperialists such as the United States and Germany, was carrying out the fifth "encirclement and suppression" campaign against the Chinese revolution in difficult times, Comrade Ren Bishi was sent by the CPC Central Committee to the Xianggan Soviet Area. You brought the experience of Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Zhu De leading the Red Army in smashing Chiang Kai-shek's first, second, third, and fourth "encirclement and suppression" campaigns, as well as the experience of Soviet construction, which enabled the Xianggan Soviet Area and the Red Army, which were then in a serious situation, to develop and consolidate. You reversed the "leftist" errors in the internal ideological struggle of the petty-bourgeois revolutionaries and doctrinaires within the Party at that time, and rescued Comrades Wang Shoudao, Zhang Qilong, Zhang Pinghua, Wang Enmao, and Zeng Di, who had been attacked by the doctrinaires. At that time, the doctrinaires Chen Hongshi, Liu Shijie, and others all betrayed the revolution during the severe enemy's fifth encirclement and suppression campaign. Comrade Ren Bishi made indelible contributions to maintaining the Party and the Red Army in the Xianggan Soviet Area.
    After the Second National Soviet Congress, when I returned to the Xianggan Soviet Area, Comrade Mao Zedong talked to me and instructed that the Red Army in the Xianggan Soviet Area must adopt mobile warfare in order to consolidate and develop. Comrade Ren Bishi resolutely implemented Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, abandoned the simple defense at that time and adopted mobile warfare aimed at concentrating forces to annihilate the enemy's effective strength. You applied Comrade Mao Zedong's military thinking, persuaded the leading comrades of the provincial party committee and the military region to implement the strategic and tactical policies instructed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and achieved a victory in annihilating an entire brigade of the Kuomintang bandit army Hou Pengfei in one battle, which saved the Red Army's situation that had been frustrated at that time and gained victory and development. This was a key to the establishment of the Sixth Red Army Corps to carry out the 25,000-li Long March for the purpose of going north to resist Japan.
    In the autumn of 1934, the main force of the Xianggan Red Army, the Sixth Red Army Corps, under your personal organization and leadership—at that time you were the representative of the Central Committee and the chairman of the military and political committee of the Sixth Army Corps—broke through the siege from Jiangxi and swept across the borders of Xiang, Gui, Dian, and Chuan, and merged with the Second Red Army Corps led by Comrade He Long.
    During the Long March, in the extremely difficult and tense circumstances, you possessed Comrade Mao Zedong's style of studying the situation with extreme calmness, meticulousness, and tireless effort. This was often praised by Comrade He Long during the Long March, and Xiao Ke, Li Da, Zhang Zhiyi, Gan Siqi, and others will never forget it. In the serious situation of the Long March, you taught us how to encourage the fighting spirit of commanders and fighters, despise the enemy, and strengthen confidence in victory, such as when we encountered the White bandit Chongxi in Yanqian, Guizhou, who surrounded us on all sides with ten times our strength. At that time, you were suffering from severe illness due to overwork. We were surrounded on all sides and trapped in the deep ravines of the mountains. When the scouts brought in old peasants, you personally inquired, and the peasants said: "Every mountain has relatives, and relatives connect to Nanjing." You taught Zhang Zhiyi, the director of the political department, to convey these two sentences to the entire army that was surrounded, launched a brave breakout, encouraged morale, and successfully broke through the enemy's encirclement.
    After the Sixth Red Army Corps and the Second Red Army Corps merged, you led the Second Front Army with Comrade He Long in the victorious struggle in the border area of Xiang, E, Chuan, and Qian, according to the spirit of the Zunyi Conference led by Comrade Mao Zedong. You educated Comrade Xia Xi, who had committed serious errors, to correct his mistakes and unite him to support the Mao Zedong line and fight heroically (Comrade Xia Xi gloriously sacrificed himself in the Long March). The criticism and self-criticism carried out within the Party achieved the goal of uniting ourselves and defeating the enemy in the arduous struggle.
    During the Long March, you were barefoot, wore straw sandals, and short pants. At the age of thirty, we often asked the common people: How old do you think he (Comrade Bishi) is? The masses always said you were more than fifty years old. This was because you were devoted to the cause of liberation of the Chinese people, suffered the ravages of counter-revolutionary prisons and torture, and endured the hardships of war.
    The great fighter—Comrade Ren Bishi's Bolshevik calmness and tenacity established the trust of cadres and fighters in you. The young and brave Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, in the serious situation of being blocked and pursued by the enemy, carried out a 25,000-li Long March, fighting in Xiang, E, Gan, Chuan, Qian, and Dian, crossed the natural barrier of the Jinsha River, entered Xikang, trekked through snowy mountains and grasslands, and merged with the Fourth Front Army. Under the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Zhu and you, we united the Second and Fourth Front Armies, carried out the struggle against the traitor Zhang Guotao, and led the Second and Fourth Front Armies northward, which enabled the heroic Chinese Red Army to maintain its basic effective strength, and enabled the main force of the Chinese Red Army to have a grand meeting in the Northwest. Under the leadership of the great leader of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people—Comrade Mao Zedong—we won the basic victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation nationwide.
    In the days when the Chinese people were cutting through thorns and suffering hardships, as the outstanding son of the Chinese people, the heroic and great Bolshevik fighter—Comrade Ren Bishi—the model you gave us will last forever. The revolutionary cause that you dedicated your whole life to for the Chinese people is immortal. Our Party and army must learn from Comrade Ren Bishi's Bolshevik model qualities of loyalty, honesty, tenacity, simplicity, calmness, meticulousness, and high principledness and seriousness.
    Respected Comrade Bishi, due to the loss of your death, we vow to respond to the call of the obituary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, transform grief into strength, take your deeds as a model, and in the struggle against the aggression of American imperialism, carry forward the noble communist qualities of your great son of the Chinese people, carry forward the spirit of internationalism and patriotism under the banner of Mao Zedong, and defend the people's motherland!
    Respected Comrade Bishi, rest in peace! We will learn from your Bolshevik model and fight to the end for the victory of the Bolshevik cause!

　　悼念任弼时同志
    王震
    伟大中国人民的优秀儿子，中国最早的共产主义者，毛泽东同志杰出的学生和亲密战友之一任弼时同志的逝世，使中国共产党和中国人民解放军失去了一位刚毅顽强久经考验的英明领导者，中华民族和中国人民失去了一位杰出的政治家。我以亲身在您领导和教诲下的共产党员，悲痛地追念您！
    早在一九二五至一九二七年的中国大革命运动中，任弼时同志即给予了中国劳动人民和广大青年以巨大影响。一九三一年在江西瑞金召开的第一次全国苏维埃代表大会时，任弼时同志是当时以毛泽东同志为首的中央苏区中共中央局的组织部长，我是出席这次代表大会的湘赣苏区代表团的支部书记，幸运地第一次和您会面，您召我详细地询问了湘赣苏区的工农群众和红军的斗争情形，您以布尔塞维克组织家和教育家的高度热情把我们出席全国苏维埃代表大会的代表团化为一个训练班，您替我们拟出的代表团的学习计划日程上，有毛主席、朱总司令、周恩来同志以及其他同志的讲课。其中有您亲自讲授党的建设。
    一九三三年五月，正当蒋贼在美国德国等帝国主义援助下对中国革命进行五次“围剿”的艰难日子里，任弼时同志被中共中央派到湘赣苏区，你带来了毛泽东和朱德同志领导红军粉碎蒋贼一、二、三、四次“围剿”胜利的经验和苏维埃建设的经验，使当时处在严重情况下的湘赣苏区和红军，得到了发展和巩固，你扭转了当时党内小资产阶级革命家和教条主义的党内思想斗争的左的错误，将王首道、张启龙、张平化、王恩茂、曾涤等同志被教条主义者所打击下拯救出来，而当时教条主义者陈洪时、刘士杰等均于在严重的敌人五次围剿中叛变了革命。任弼时同志在保持湘赣苏区的党和红军是有不可磨灭的功绩。
    在第二次全苏维埃代表大会后，当我回湘赣苏区时，毛泽东同志与我谈话，指示湘赣苏区红军要巩固和发展一定得采取运动战。任弼时同志坚决执行了毛泽东同志的指示，放弃了当时的单纯防御而采取了集中力量以歼灭敌人有生力量为目的的运动战，您运用了毛泽东同志的军事思想，说服了当时省委和军区的领导同志执行了毛泽东同志所指示的战略战术方针，取得了一仗歼灭国民党匪军侯鹏飞一个整旅的胜利，挽救了当时红军已经受挫的情势，获得了胜利和发展，这是成立红六军团实行北上抗日的二万五千里长征的一个关键。
    一九三四年秋天，湘赣红军主力，红六军团在您亲自组织和领导下，那时您是当中央的代表和六军团军政委员会的主席，由赣突围，横扫湘、桂、滇、川边和贺龙同志领导的红二军团汇合了。
    在长征途中非常艰苦和紧张的情况下，您具有着极其镇定地、周密地和不怕疲倦的研究情况的毛泽东同志的作风。这是贺龙同志在长征中经常赞颂的，萧克、李达、张志意、甘泗淇等永不能忘的。在长征严重情况中，您教导我们如何去鼓励指战员的斗志，蔑视敌人，坚定胜利的信心，如我们在贵州研阡遭遇着白匪崇禧以十倍于我的力量四面包围，那时您积劳成疾患严重的病症。我们被四面包围陷于大山深豁之中，当侦察员请来了老农民时，你亲自询问，农民说：“山山有亲，亲亲通南京”。您教政治部主任张志意同志把这两名话传达给被包围的全军，发起了勇敢的突围，鼓励了士气，胜利地冲破了敌人的重围。
    在红六军团和红二军团汇合了以后，您根据毛泽东同志领导的遵义会议的精神与贺龙同志领导了红二方面军，在湘、鄂、川、黔、边区的胜利斗争，您根据毛泽东同志的指示教育了犯严重错误的夏曦同志改正错误，团结他拥护毛泽东路线而英勇斗争（夏曦同志在长征中光荣牺牲了），在党内进行的批评与自我批评，达到了在艰苦斗争中团结自己，战胜敌人的目的。
    在长征中您是赤足、草鞋、短裤子。三十岁时我们经常问老百姓：你看看他（弼时同志）有多少岁？群众总是说您五十多岁。这是由于您尽忠于中国人民的解放事业，遭受了反革命监牢和酷刑的摧残和艰苦战争的劳瘁。
    伟大的战士——任弼时同志的布尔塞维克的镇定和坚毅的精神，树立了干部和战士对于您的信赖，年青的勇敢的工农红军在敌人的前堵后追，左右侧击的严重情况下，实行二万五千里的长征中，转战湘、鄂、赣、川、黔、滇，渡过了金沙江的天险，进入西康，跋涉雪山草地，和红四方面军汇合。在朱总司令和您的领导下，团结了二、四两方面军，进行了反对叛徒张国焘的斗争，领导了二、四方面军北上，使英勇的中国红军保持了基本的有生力量，使中国红军主力在西北大会师，在中国共产党和中国人民伟大领袖——毛泽东同志领导下争取了抗日战争和解放战争在全国的基本胜利。
    在中国人民斩棘酸辛的日子里，作为中国人民的优秀儿子，布尔塞维克的英勇伟大战士——任弼时同志，所给予我们的模范是永远长存的。您以全部生命所贡献给中国人民的革命事业是永垂不朽的。我们党和军队要学习任弼时同志的忠诚老实、坚毅、朴素、镇定、精细和具有高度原则性严肃性的布尔塞维克的模范品质。
    敬爱的弼时同志，由于您的逝世的损失，我们誓在中国共产党中央委员会讣文的号召下，化悲痛为力量，以您的事迹为楷模，在反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争中，发扬中国人民伟大儿子——您的崇高的共产主义的品质，在毛泽东的旗帜下发扬国际主义和爱国主义的精神捍卫人民祖国！
    敬爱的弼时同志，安息吧！我们学习您的布尔塞维克的模范，为布尔塞维克的事业胜利而奋斗到底！
