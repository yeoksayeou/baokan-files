Xinhua News Agency, Tonghua, November 15th. In the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, the people of the Changbai Mountains are recalling the heroic deeds of the Korean people fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese people during the War of Resistance Against Japan. The Changbai Mountains were an important base area for the Anti-Japanese United Army back then. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, patriots from China and Korea fought bloody battles with Japanese imperialism here, and many moving deeds have been passed down among the people.

　　An old worker from a certain mine, Zhang Keyun, often tells his colleagues stories of fighting alongside the Korean people against the Japanese sixteen years ago during work breaks. At that time, in the anti-Japanese guerrilla隊 led by General Yang Jingyu, which was active in the Ji'an and Huanren areas, there were more than 500 outstanding sons and daughters of both China and Korea. Zhang Keyun's company was once surrounded by Japanese bandits on a mountain top in the Changbai Mountains, and more than 60 Korean soldiers heroically sacrificed themselves to cover the breakout of this unit. As they sacrificed themselves, they shouted, "Down with Japanese imperialism!"

　　An old teacher living in Fushong County often tells his students that many Korean patriots who persisted in the anti-Japanese guerrilla war in the county once relieved the people here from much suffering, and the people will never forget them. An old photographer, Feng Taizhong, said: Once, a Korean soldier in the Anti-Japanese United Army was captured by Japanese devils. The Japanese cursed him as a "bandit" (meaning bandit), and the Korean soldier shouted back, "You are the bandits for invading China!" He was eventually beaten to death by the Japanese bandits. The old photographer said excitedly: Today, the American bandits are invading Korea and also invading China. It is only natural for our Chinese people to volunteer to go to Korea to fight.

　　In the lush mountains around Bao'an Village in Jingyu County, which used to be the haunt of the Anti-Japanese United Army, countless Korean patriots heroically sacrificed themselves in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese bandits. Once, a part of the Anti-Japanese United Army persisted in fighting under the encirclement of the Japanese bandits for half a month. Finally, three Korean soldiers rushed into the enemy's陣地, seized the enemy's weapons, and continued to resist. Although these three Korean warriors sacrificed themselves, they covered the safe retreat of most of their comrades.

　　The people of Tonghua City will never forget February 3, 1946. On that day, Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents, instigated by U.S. imperialism, colluded with more than 2,000 Japanese people to carry out a large-scale armed riot. Fortunately, the Li Hongguang Detachment, composed of the Korean ethnic group, suppressed it in a timely manner, saving 80,000 citizens from massacre.

　　长白山区人民
    追忆抗日朝鲜志士
    【新华社通化十五日电】长白山区广大人民在抗美援朝保家卫国运动中，追忆抗日战争时期朝鲜人民和中国人民并肩作战的英勇事迹。长白山区是当年抗日联军的重要根据地之一。在抗日战争中，中朝两国的志士在这里曾和日本帝国主义进行过浴血的搏斗，在人民中间流传了很多可歌可泣的事迹。
    某矿山老工人张可运，常在工作间隙对职工们讲述他自己在十六年前与朝鲜人民并肩抗日的故事。那时，活跃在辑安、桓仁一带的杨靖宇将军所领导的抗日游击队中，有五百多名中朝两国的优秀儿女。张可运参加的那一连队，有一次被日寇围困在长白山的一个山顶上，六十多名朝鲜战士，为了掩护这支部队的突围都英勇的牺牲了。他们在牺牲时，还高呼“打倒日本帝国主义”。
    居住在抚松县的一位老教员，常对学生们说，曾在该县坚持过抗日游击战争的许多朝鲜志士，曾解救了这里人民的不少苦难，人们永远忘不了他们。一位老照像师冯泰忠说：某次，抗日联军中的一位朝鲜战士被日本鬼子捉了去，日本人骂他是“胡子”（土匪之意），朝鲜战士大声回骂：“你们侵略中国才是胡子”，最后被日寇打死。老照像师激动地说：今天美国胡子侵略朝鲜，又侵略中国，我们中国人民志愿去朝鲜作战，那是理所当然。
    靖宇县保安村一带的葱郁山林中，过去是抗日联军的出没之地，那里曾经有无数的朝鲜志士在和日寇的肉搏中英勇牺牲了。有一次，一部分的抗日联军在日寇的包围下坚持战斗半月之久，最后有三个朝鲜籍战士冲入敌人的阵地，夺取敌人的武器，继续抵抗。这三个朝鲜勇士虽然自己牺牲了，但却掩护了多数同志的安全撤退。
    通化市人民永远也不会忘记一九四六年二月三日，那一天，美帝国主义指使的蒋介石特务，勾结了两千多名日本人，进行了大规模的武装暴动，幸有朝鲜民族组成的李红光支队予以及时的镇压，才使八万市民免于屠杀。
