　　Two Berlins
    ——Visit to the German Democratic Republic, Part II
    Wu Wentao
    For a newcomer, today's Berlin is sure to leave many strong impressions. But all these impressions can be summarized into one general conclusion: the peaceful and democratic construction of the current world versus the imperialist conspiracy to launch a new war; the thriving economy of socialism and New Democracy and the solemn lives of the people, versus the corrupt economic system and lifestyle of imperialism, are juxtaposed with unparalleled clarity in this one city.
    After the Red Army liberated Berlin, according to the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement, it was divided into four occupation zones by the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, and governed by a joint committee. Of the twenty districts in the city, the Soviet army occupied eight districts, with a population of 1,200,000; the Western United States, Britain, and France occupied twelve districts, with a population of 2,100,000. According to statistics on those who pay social insurance, East Berlin (i.e., the Soviet-controlled area) has about 600,000 industrial workers, while West Berlin (the British, American, and French occupation zones) has about 800,000 industrial workers.
    In 1948, the American, British, and French imperialists violated the agreement by unilaterally implementing a new currency system in West Germany and West Berlin, and declared that only the West Mark printed in New York was legal tender in Berlin, attempting to plunge the people of the eastern zone into desperation. Berlin has been divided ever since. Today, the eastern zone is the location of the central organs of the German Democratic Republic, while the western zone has become a typical colony of Wall Street. If you walk southwest or northwest from the Thalmann Street, Leipzig Street, Unter den Linden, or Friedrich Street in the city center of the Soviet-controlled area, you will see a white wooden sign at many street corners, painted with the black, red, and yellow flag of the Republic, with a line of large characters below: "Here you have entered the democratic area," or a sign that says, "Here you are entering the American (British, French) occupation zone..." The dividing lines are inconsistent. Sometimes a transverse street is the boundary, with the democratic area on one side and the occupation zone of the imperialist countries on the other. Sometimes a wooden frame stands in the middle of a street or in the middle of a bridge, becoming a boundary marker between the two zones.
    Readers may have this question: If a city is divided into two parts, how are the public utilities, which are inseparable from the lives of citizens, carried out?
    The divisive policy of American and British imperialism has also divided the public utilities of Berlin into two parts: water, electricity, and gas are all separated; trams and subways have to change drivers and conductors at the border, and the tickets sold and fares collected change accordingly. When the car turns back, it changes again in the same way. Only Berlin's trains are uniformly controlled by the Soviet army in accordance with the agreement.
    The residents of the two districts, regardless of the obstruction by the American, British, and French occupation forces and their secret police, are still traveling back and forth. For someone who is not familiar with the streets of Berlin, of course, looking at the boundary markers is a way to identify the area. In fact, people can tell which area they are walking in without looking at the boundary markers.
    During the day, in the democratic area, you see: workers climbing on cedar poles to repair houses, women clearing usable bricks or steel bars from the ruins, or groups of young people loading waste soil onto small trains. Here, everyone has a job, and labor is always in short supply. In the occupation zone of the imperialist countries, what you see are men, women, old, and young crowded on the sidewalks, looking lost and anxious. They stare blankly at the dazzling array of American bananas, oranges, Coca-Cola, or American-made nylon stockings in the shop windows. How many people can afford them? The officially published number of registered unemployed workers in West Berlin alone is as high as 300,000. Adding their families, at least one-third of the entire West Berlin population is unemployed. In addition, there are 50,000 people who are semi-employed. Near the West Berlin Zoo railway station, the streets and alleys are bustling with people doing black market business: American soldiers are using smuggled "Camel" cigarettes to exchange for gold and silver jewelry, there are people soliciting to exchange US dollars, there are opium dens, and there are small shops buying the pants of the unemployed...
    At night, in East Berlin, everyone except the night shift workers rests after working all day. In West Berlin, there are nightclubs or nude female wrestling performances. You don't have to worry about not finding a place, because eye-catching advertisements will point you to everything. Call girls who are available day and night are, of course, a given.
    On the evening of my fourth day in Berlin, I went to a theater in the democratic area with some friends to see "Mother Courage and Her Children," an opera set against the background of the Thirty Years' War (Editor's note: The Thirty Years' War was a war between the Bourbon and Habsburg dynasties from 1618 to 1648) against wars of plunder. The author of the opera had received a bonus from the government of the Democratic Republic. A balding man in his forties sitting next to me started talking to me. His name was Hans (surname forgotten), and he lived in West Berlin. He used to be an employee of an artificial edible oil factory in the western district but became unemployed because the factory closed down. Since this year, he has found a job in a factory in the democratic area. I asked him if he came to East Berlin to see the show because he didn't have West Berlin marks, and he said, "Our democratic government gives us a lot of exchange convenience. We (he pointed to a few people sitting on his side) just don't want to waste money and precious time on American movies and dramas full of assassinations and robbers."
    Two days later, I learned from the chairman of the Berlin Democratic District Trade Union that there are now about 100,000 workers who were unemployed in West Berlin but found work in the democratic area. Taking artificial edible oil, which Hans used to work in, as an example, there were originally twelve factories in West Berlin after the war. Due to the large influx of American artificial edible oil, seven factories have been forced to close down. According to official figures published by West Berlin, 12,000 factories, workshops, and shops in the area have closed down from 1945 to the spring of this year. An interesting story is the Borsig locomotive factory in the French occupation zone of West Berlin. This factory was one of the largest locomotive factories in Germany during the war, employing 12,000 people in the past. The French authorities dismantled most of the factory's machinery, and now only 800 workers are left to do some machine repair work. With the help of the democratic government in the eastern district, those unemployed workers came up with a way out: in East Berlin, the government designated an address to build a new locomotive factory still named Borsig, and the unemployed workers automatically came to work as volunteers, with more than 3,000 people participating every Sunday. From the start of construction last year to June of this year, the completed factory building already has 2,400 workers working there. At the same time, the democratic government has increased its investment in the new factory by 3 million marks (approximately US$900,000), and the scale of production will be expanded several times.
    In this way, the people in the western district see East Berlin as seeing light in the dark, and the American imperialists and their West Berlin puppet mayor Reuter (one of the reactionary leaders of the Social Democratic Party) are panicking. They declared that West Berlin was in a state of "emergency." At the beginning of this year, the western district authorities decided to use several million marks to call on some unemployed workers to do "emergency" work to clean streets and rubble, and boasted that 50,000 workers would be employed before May 1st of this year, but by the middle of the year, only 24,000 unemployed people had been absorbed. The reason is, on the one hand, there is no work, and at the same time, the so-called "emergency" work is to call on workers to work five days a week (usually six days), and take ten marks of "emergency" wages for each working day (usually twelve marks), so the income of workers, in addition to taxes and social insurance premiums, is less than the income from unemployment relief (insured unemployed workers can receive 26 weeks of relief in accordance with regulations, and do not pay taxes). Some factory owners see that it is profitable, so they dismiss workers for no reason, and then take them back from the city hall two days later and give them "emergency wages," or take the opportunity to reduce wages as the number of unemployed increases. The West Berlin Siemens Electric Factory, which employs 22,000 workers, reduced the wages of all of its more than 10,000 female workers by 17.5% in April.
    The mayor of democratic Berlin, Ebert, told me that in 1949, the eastern district repaired 16,000 workers' houses, which still could not meet the demands of West Berliners coming here to work. Therefore, the American imperialists arbitrarily implemented an exchange rate of eight to one between East and West Marks to restrict West Berlin workers from coming to the democratic district to work, but the result proved to be futile. Although the wage amounts in the two districts are roughly the same (such as ordinary workers in the western district earning 300 West Marks per month, and the democratic district earning 300 East Marks), in terms of prices, basic food and supplies in the eastern district are cheaper than in West Berlin. For example, one kilogram of bread in the western district costs 0.9 West Marks, while buying it with rationing tickets in the eastern district costs only 0.6 East Marks; a piece of cooking oil weighing 500 grams costs one West Mark in the western district, and also one East Mark in the eastern district....
    One Berlin—two cities, two worlds. The demands of the German people can be seen from the slogans that people secretly write on the walls of the western district government offices and the US military headquarters at night: "Americans, go home!", "The whole of Berlin belongs to democratic Germany, and the whole of democratic Germany belongs to Berlin."

　　两个柏林
    ——德意志民主共和国访问之二
    吴文焘
    对于一个初来的访问者，今天的柏林的确会给他很多强烈的印象。但是所有的印象，都可归到一个总的结论：当前世界上的和平民主建设与帝国主义发动新战争的阴谋；社会主义、新民主主义的欣欣向荣的经济和人民的严肃生活，与帝国主义腐朽了的经济制度和生活方式，被无比明显地并陈在这一个城市里。
    红军解放柏林后，根据波茨坦协定的规定，由苏、美、英、法四国分区占领，而由一个共同的委员会来管制。在全城二十个区中，苏军占领八个区，一、二○○、○○○人口；西方美、英、法占领十二个区，二、一○○、○○○人口。按照缴纳社会保险费者的统计数字，东柏林（即苏管区）约有六○○、○○○产业工人，西柏林（英、美、法占区）约有八○○、○○○产业工人。
    一九四八年美、英、法帝国主义者违约单独在西德和西柏林实行新币制，并在柏林宣布只有从纽约印来的西马克为法币，图使东区的人民陷于绝境。柏林从此就被分裂了。今天，东区是德意志民主共和国的中央机关所在地，西区变成了典型的一块华尔街的殖民地。如果你从市中心苏管区的台尔曼大街、莱比锡大街、菩提树大街或弗烈德利施大街向西南或西北走，你会在很多街口上看到一个白色的木牌，上面漆着共和国黑、红、黄三色的国旗，下面一行大字“这里你已经进入了民主区”，或者一个牌子写着“这里你进入了美（英、法）占领区……”。分界线是不一致的。有时是以一道横行的街道为界，一边是民主区，另一边就是帝国主义国家的占领区。有时一条街的中间，或一座桥的中间立着一个木架，成了两个区的界碑。
    读者会有这样的问题了：一个城市分成两部，那么，与市民生活不可分离的公用事业怎样进行呢？
    美英帝国主义的分裂政策，也使柏林市的公用事业分成两部分：水、电和瓦斯都是分开的；电车、地下车到了交界的地方，就要换司机和售票员，卖的票和收的车费都随着改变。到了车子开回头来，再照样换一次。只有柏林的火车是根据协定统一由苏军管制的。
    两个地区的居民却不顾美、英、法占领军及其特务警察的阻挠，还是在往来着。对于一个不熟悉柏林街道的人，当然看界碑是一个辨认地区的方法。其实，人们不看界碑，也会知道他在行走在那个地区。
    白天，在民主区，你看到的是：攀登在杉木竿架上修理房屋的工人，从废墟中清理可用的砖瓦或钢条的妇女，或往小火车上装废土的成群的青年。这里人人有工作，劳动力总是感到不够。而在帝国主义国家的占领区，你所看到的则是拥挤在行人道上的惶惶然若有所失的男女老幼。他们望着店铺玻璃橱窗里琳琅满目的美国香蕉、橘子、可口可乐，或是什么美造玻璃丝袜等发呆。有几个人能买得起呢？单只西柏林官方发表的已登记的失业工人，就有三十万之多，加上他们的家属，起码要有三分之一的全西柏林人口失业。另外还有五○、○○○人是半就业的。在西柏林动物园火车站附近，大街小巷是熙熙攘攘作黑市生意的人：有美国兵用走私来的“骆驼”牌香烟套取金银珠宝的，有招揽兑换美金的，有鸦片烟店，也有收买失业者的裤子的小铺。……
    夜里，在东柏林，除了夜班工人，大家都劳动一天而休息了。在西柏林则有夜总会，或女子裸体摔跤表演。你不用愁找不到地方，因为惹眼的广告会指给你一切。日夜接待的吉普女郎当然是不在话下的。
    我到柏林第四天的傍晚，和几个朋友到民主区一个剧院去看《古拉日妈妈和她的子女们》，这是以三十年战争（编者按：三十年战争是一六一八至一六四八年的波旁王朝与哈布斯堡王朝之间的战争）为背景，反对掠夺战争的歌剧。歌剧的作者曾获得民主共和国政府的奖金。坐在我旁边的一个四十来岁顶门秃了的男子和我搭起话来。他叫汗斯（姓忘记了）住在西柏林，原是一个西区人造食油工厂的职员，因为工厂关了门而失业。从今年起，他已在民主区的工厂找到了工作。我问他是否因为没有西柏林马克才来东柏林看戏的，他说：“我们的民主政府给我们很多兑换上的便利。我们（他指着坐在他那一边的几个人说）只是不愿意把金钱和宝贵的时间浪费在美国那些充满了暗杀和强盗的电影和戏剧上面。”
    隔了两天，从柏林民主区总工会主席那里，我知道：在西柏林失业而在民主区找到工作的工人，现在约有十万人。就以汗斯过去从事的人造食油来说，西柏林战后原有十二个厂，由于美国人造食油的大量输入，已迫使七个厂关了门。西柏林官方发表的数字，从一九四五年到今年春，该区倒闭的工厂、作坊及商店已有一万二千家。一个有趣的故事是西柏林法占区的包西格火车头工厂。这个工厂是战时德国最大的火车头工厂之一，过去雇用一二、○○○人。法国当局将该厂的大部分机器拆走了，现在只剩有八百工人作些修理机器的活计。那些失了业的工人在东区民主政府的帮助下想出了一条生路：在东柏林，政府指定了地址，要建立一个仍用包西格为名的新火车头工厂，失业工人们就自动来作义务工，每个星期天都有三千以上的人参加。从去年动工到今年六月，完成了的厂房里，已有二千四百个工人工作着。同时，民主政府又对这个新厂增加了三百万马克（约合九十万美金）的投资，生产的规模将扩充数倍。
    这样，西区的人们看东柏林，像在黑夜里看到了光亮，美帝国主义者及其西柏林傀儡市长路特（社会民主党反动领袖之一）等着慌了。他们宣布西柏林处在“紧急情况”之下。西区当局今年年初决定以几百万马克叫一部分失业工人作清扫街道和瓦砾的“紧急”工作，并大吹大擂地说今年五一以前将有五万工人就业，但到年中时，也只吸收了两万四千失业者。原因，一方面是没有工作，同时，所谓“紧急”工作，乃是叫工人们一星期做五天工（平时六天），每工作一天拿十马克的“紧急”工资（平时一般为十二马克），因此，工人的收入除了纳税和社会保险费外，所余尚不如领失业救济金的收入多（保了险的失业工人照章可领二十六个星期的救济金，且不交税）。有些厂主看到有利可图，就无端将工人开除，过两天再从市政厅把他们领回来，给以“紧急工资”，或者就乘失业者增多的机会实行降低工资。雇有二万二千工人的西柏林西门子电气工厂，就在四月里把全体一万多女工的工资降低了百分之十七·五。
    民主柏林的市长艾伯特告诉我：一九四九年东区修复了一万六千所工人住房，还不能满足西柏林来此工作的要求，于是，美帝国主义者就武断实行东西马克八对一的兑换率，来限制西柏林工人到民主区来工作，但结果证明是徒劳的。两区的工资数额尽管大致一样（如西区普通工人每月三百西马克，民主区为三百东马克），而照物价来说，东区的基本食品与用品则较西柏林为便宜。例如：西区一公斤面包为○·九西马克，东区用配给票买仅○·六东马克；五百公分重的一块食用油，西区为一西马克，东区也是一个东马克……。
    一个柏林——两个城市，两个世界。德国人民的要求，可以从夜里人们偷写在西区官署和美军总部墙上的标语看出来：“美国人，滚回家去吧！”，“整个柏林是民主德国的，整个民主德国是柏林的。”
