Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 1st—The People's Liberation Army troops marching into Tibet have been warmly welcomed and loved by the Tibetan people along the way after entering the Xikang area. When a certain unit arrived in Ganzi County, all the lamas of the famous Gelugpa Huiyuan Temple lined up outside the city to welcome them, and specially presented "Hada" (silk scarves, meeting gifts used by Tibetans to express respect). The unit also immediately sent representatives to Huiyuan Temple to return "Hada" and tea, and explained in detail the ethnic policies in the Common Program. All the Khenpos (abbots) and lamas of the temple listened with smiles and repeatedly praised the strict discipline of the People's Liberation Army. They requested the unit to convey their respects to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. After the troops entered the city, they all camped outdoors and did not enter civilian houses, which greatly moved the Tibetans, who voluntarily sent tea, water, pots, firewood, etc. to the troops'驻地,供部队使用.

Many Tibetans in northern Xikang clearly remember the historical fact that the Red Army helped local people establish the Boba Democratic Government when they passed through the area during the Long March. They showed great love for the soldiers. When the PLA troops arrived, a large group of Tibetans surrounded the troops, stroking the soldiers' equipment. Every time the troops arrived in a city, the people of all ethnic groups in the city immediately set off firecrackers to express their welcome. The Tibetans along the way voluntarily took out firewood and grain to support the PLA's continued advance.

When a certain unit arrived in Lihua County in central Xikang, the Tibetans lined up two miles outside the city to welcome them. When the PLA soldiers came down from the top of the mountain, the welcoming Tibetans let out touching cheers. After entering the city, the team held a joint celebration with the local people of all ethnic groups. The Khenpo of Lihua Temple also brought three hundred lamas to participate in the celebration. Tibetan women carried yak butter tea pots and hugged their children, happily attending the meeting. The local women's association and Lihua Primary School also set up tents next to the venue, as if celebrating a festival. After the meeting, Tibetan youths danced their national dances, and PLA soldiers performed Yangko dances, and the venue was filled with the feeling of ethnic friendship. When the troops continued to advance, the Tibetans gave the PLA soldiers jars of milk, yak butter, and other foods, according to their ethnic group's most respectful and affectionate etiquette. More than a dozen Tibetan youths sang their own folk songs to compare ethnic unity: "The water of ten thousand mountains comes from one ditch, temporarily branching out, and finally meeting in the sea." The commanders and fighters shouted the slogan "Tibetans and Han people unite" to answer the Tibetan and Han compatriots who were sending them off.

During the march, the troops constantly encountered Tibetans coming and going on the road. The soldiers took out cigarettes they had brought from thousands of miles away to treat them. The medical staff of the troops treated the Tibetans along the way and publicized hygiene knowledge, which was extremely popular among the Tibetans. Sick Tibetans went to the troops' medical staff for treatment. The Tibetans along the way were deeply moved by the PLA soldiers' kind and loving behavior towards the people. Many of them voluntarily lent their cowhides to the soldiers to sleep on, fearing that the dampness of the Kang border would affect the soldiers' health. Tibetans in a certain place voluntarily prepared manpower and animal power to welcome and send off the PLA, but the troops politely declined them one by one. Balong, a Tibetan in Changchunba, treasured the proclamation of the PLA's Three Main Rules of Discipline, Eight Points for Attention, and the ethnic policies in the Common Program printed in Tibetan, and took out yak legs, highland barley wheat candy, and yak butter, treating the soldiers like honored guests.

The warm welcome and send-off from the Tibetans along the way further inspired the soldiers' will to advance rapidly. The soldiers have expressed that they will repay the Tibetans' love with actions to quickly liberate Tibet.

　　进军西藏的解放军
    沿途受藏民热烈欢迎
    部队与各族人民集会联欢
    【新华社重庆一日电】人民解放军进军西藏的部队在进入西康地区后，沿途受到藏族人民的热烈欢迎和爱戴。某部在抵达干宁县城时，著名的黄教惠远寺全体喇嘛列队出城欢迎，并专送“哈达”（丝质带，为藏胞表示敬意用的见面礼物）。该部亦立即派代表到惠远寺还赠“哈达”和茶叶，并详尽解释共同纲领中的民族政策。该寺全体堪布（即曾长）、喇嘛含笑静听，并一再赞扬人民解放军纪律严明。他们要求该部代他们向毛主席和朱总司令致敬。部队进城后，一律露营户外，不进民房，藏胞极为感动，纷纷自动把茶、水、锅、柴等送到部队驻地，供部队使用。
    西康北部地区的很多藏胞还清楚地记得红军长征经过该地时帮助当地人民建立博巴民主政府的史实，他们对战士们表现了高度的热爱。当解放军部队到达时，就有一大群藏胞围着部队，抚摸着战士们的装备。部队每到一个城市，城里的各族人民立即放着鞭炮表示欢迎。沿途的藏胞都自动拿出柴、粮支援解放军继续前进。
    某部在抵达西康中部理化县城时，藏胞们列队出城二里郊迎。当解放军自山顶走下来时，欢迎的藏胞们发出了感人的欢呼。该队于进城后，与当地各族人民举行了联欢大会。理化寺堪布也带着三百喇嘛来参加联欢。藏胞妇女们提着酥油茶壶，抱着小孩，兴高采烈地赴会。当地妇女会和理化小学还在会场旁搭起帐篷，如像欢度佳节一样。会后藏胞青年跳着他们的民族舞，解放军战士们扭着秧歌，会场上洋溢着民族友爱的感情。部队继续前进时，藏胞们把满罐的牛奶、酥油等食品，按照他们民族的最尊敬、亲切的礼节，送给解放军。十多个藏胞青年高唱着他们自己的民歌来比喻民族团结：“万山的水呀出自一沟，暂时分支流开了，终在大海里碰头。”指战员们高呼着“藏汉人民团结起来”的口号，来回答欢送他们的藏、汉同胞。
    在进军途中，部队在路上不断遇到来来往往的藏胞们。战士们拿出千里外带来的香烟招待他们。部队的医务人员沿途给藏胞治病，并宣传卫生常识，极为藏胞们所欢迎。有病的藏胞都纷纷找部队医务人员看病。沿途藏胞们深为解放军战士们亲切爱民的行为所感动，他们很多人自动地把自己的牛皮借给战士铺着睡，他们怕康境地湿会影响战士们的身体。某地藏胞自动在路旁准备好人力、畜力迎送解放军，均为部队一一婉谢。长春坝一位藏胞巴隆把用藏文印的解放军三大纪律、八项注意和共同纲领中的民族政策布告珍藏起来，并且拿出牛腿、青稞麦糖、绺耙，如迎贵宾一样招待战士。
    沿途藏胞的热烈迎送，更加激励了战士们迅速进军的意志。战士们纷纷表示要用迅速解放西藏的行动来答谢藏胞的热爱。
