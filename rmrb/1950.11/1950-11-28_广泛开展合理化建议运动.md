Broadly Launch the Rationalization Proposal Campaign
    Dong Xin, Minister of Production Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions

    The Chinese People's Revolution has achieved a great victory, and the working class has been liberated from its oppressed slave status and become the master of the country. With the continuous improvement of political consciousness, the broad masses of workers can consciously plan for the people of the whole country and for the country. They can come up with ideas and find ways to overcome the current difficulties in economic construction, improve labor productivity, create more wealth for the country, and gradually transform the poor agricultural country into a rich and powerful industrial country. Only under a socialist and new democratic regime can the countless talents buried, devastated, and restricted by the reactionary ruling class be discovered, and the unparalleled wisdom of the working people be fully utilized. Their high degree of initiative and creativity can be demonstrated in production and construction. Under this premise, it is possible to propose a widespread campaign of mass inventions, technological improvements, and rationalization proposals as an important part of mass production work.
    Mass inventions, technological improvements, and rationalization proposals are advanced Soviet experiences. They were first promoted in Lushun-Dalian and the Northeast region, and some enterprises in major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai in Guannei have also successively learned these experiences and initially carried out this work. Facts have proven that no matter what enterprise department, as long as the leadership pays attention and gives guidance, the workers will immediately put forward many valuable suggestions and inventions to improve management, improve technology, overcome difficulties, increase output and quality, and reduce costs. The enthusiasm of the workers will inevitably become the driving force in the recovery and development of production. Once the rationalization proposal campaign is launched, it immediately creates huge economic effects. In the Northeast, there were 3,683 rationalization proposals in the creation of new record movement. According to statistics from the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions in the first half of 1949, workers put forward 1,377 proposals, of which 705 created a value of more than 40 billion Northeast currency. In the Lushun-Dalian area, since the rationalization proposal campaign was launched in 1947, up to 1949, workers put forward 2,600 suggestions that were adopted and implemented in three years. The value saved by the proposals totaled 2,795,141,699 yuan (Guandong currency). The Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant improved the pulverized coal device to overcome the phenomenon of powder leakage, saving 1,143,400 jin of millet every year. This is a powerful proof.
    At present, throughout the country, whether in old or new areas, all public and private enterprise departments have the objective conditions to carry out this movement, that is: the awareness of the working class has been generally improved; the working people contain infinitely rich experience and unparalleled wisdom; the government has promulgated decisions on rewarding production inventions, technological improvements, and rationalization proposals, and laws and regulations and reward methods to protect invention rights and patent rights; and trade union organizations have determined the organizations to lead this work and stipulated specific guidelines and tasks. However, inventions and creations require higher scientific knowledge and technical level, and it is currently difficult to immediately develop into a widespread mass movement. However, technological improvement and rationalization proposal campaigns can be carried out universally and on a large scale. The development of this movement should be closely combined with the current production situation and specific tasks. For example, in the Northeast, it can be carried out around the movement to create new records, promote collective contracts, improve business management, implement the responsibility system, unite technical personnel, and strengthen technical learning, to consolidate and improve the mass invention, technological improvement, and rationalization proposal campaign; in the Guannei area, rationalization proposals can be carried out in conjunction with improving old enterprises, formulating preliminary quotas, and establishing an economic accounting system; in the newly liberated areas, rationalization proposal campaigns can be carried out in overcoming difficulties and maintaining and restoring production. The overall goal is to effectively organize and mobilize workers, engineering and technical personnel, and management personnel through this movement, enrich the content of production competition, and do a good job in production. Combine the working enthusiasm of the workers with science and technology to more effectively improve labor productivity.
    According to the experience of some enterprises in several major areas in the Northeast and North China, to carry out the rationalization proposal campaign, the following issues must be resolved:
    First, open up thinking and rely on the masses.
    The experience of various places has proved that repeatedly publicizing among the workers, eliminating various concerns, and establishing a clear view of relying on the masses by the leadership, and understanding the great significance and role of rationalization proposals, are the primary conditions for carrying out the work. From the current actual situation, there are basically four incorrect ideas:
    1. There is no recognition that rationalization proposals are the most important concrete content of factory management democratization, the manifestation of the new labor attitude of the workers, an important form of production competition, and a mass line method for improving productivity. Some administrative and trade union cadres believe that rationalization proposals are a "technical" issue and have not given them enough attention, which is inappropriate. They do not realize that the rationalization proposal campaign is a concrete action by the awakened workers to be responsible for the country's production and construction, and it is also a mass movement to transform old enterprises, overcome difficulties, improve technology, and improve labor productivity. If the trade union organization is not good at launching and organizing this work, it will not achieve the goal of doing a good job in production. If the administrative leadership does not pay attention to this, the democratization of factory management will become an empty slogan, and the result of neglecting the experience and wisdom of the workers will inevitably lead to losses in national economic construction.
    2. Some technical personnel and administrative management personnel hold a contemptuous attitude towards the workers. They believe that these masses have not received higher education and have no possibility of solving problems in production. Only experts and technical personnel can handle technical problems in production and manage enterprises. Therefore, they despise the suggestions of the workers and do not listen to their opinions, learn from them with an open mind, and seriously and earnestly deal with the suggestions of the masses. They turn a blind eye to the great potential power of the workers' initiative and creativity. Even some administrative personnel and trade union cadres have adopted an intolerable, delaying and backlog, or even ignoring bureaucratic attitude towards the rationalization proposals of the masses. It greatly damages the enthusiasm of the workers and is simply a criminal act.
    At the same time, the workers who have been oppressed for a long time also have many concerns in their minds. According to the experience of the Shijiazhuang Federation of Trade Unions, workers have "four fears" in the process of carrying out rationalization proposals: "First, fear that the factory director and engineers will be jealous; second, fear that others will make sarcastic remarks and satirize them for showing off; third, fear that the proposals will not be adopted and they will not be able to step down; fourth, fear that changing unreasonable phenomena will offend people." Similarly, these concerns also exist among workers in many factories, and these concerns must be broken through repeated persuasion and education in order to carry out the movement.
    3. Some engineering and technical personnel and experienced old technical workers have technical conservatism ideas of sticking to conventions and clinging to the old, which is a serious obstacle to carrying out the rationalization proposal campaign. They are superstitious about the levels and so-called theoretical standards of capitalist countries such as Britain, the United States, and Japan, as well as the Japanese puppet Manchukuo era. They believe that they are golden rules and cannot be violated in any way, and they pretend and scare the masses. Of course, we do not fundamentally deny scientific theory, but those theories are not rigid dogmas, because scientific theory is the result of the creation of the working people, and today's working people can also break conventions and create more miracles.
    4. Insufficient attention is paid to small suggestions, and a welcoming attitude is not adopted. A factory director in Dalian said: "In the past, some workers made some suggestions for improvement in production. I always asked how many hundreds of percent of efficiency can be improved. If it cannot be increased by a factor of one or save one times the labor, then forget it." The requirements are too high, and even if there are some improvements in the workers, they feel that it is not worth much, or they simply ignore it, neither praising nor promoting it, nor calculating its value, which undermines the enthusiasm of the masses. Therefore, a very serious attitude must be adopted to treat every suggestion of the workers, and the workers should be actively and actively led and helped to study the problems in production, and they should be encouraged to make suggestions. Suggestions that cannot be adopted must also be explained to the workers in a timely manner, and they should not be left aside.
    Secondly, formulate topics and point out directions.
    To carry out the rationalization proposal campaign in a planned and organized manner, enterprise leaders should formulate "topics" based on production needs or certain production defects and problems to be solved. Some factories in Lushun-Dalian adopt the topic board method to solicit suggestions from all employees, and some adopt the technical bounty and "recruiting merits" methods to solicit suggestions. The Dalian China Changchun Railway Factory has proposed technical bounties based on the needs of each workplace, such as the electrical field proposed: the award for researching the axle tile hanging hardware for electric rollers made with new creative methods is 5,000 yuan, and the award for the workshop proposed: the award for being able to test the locomotive injector on the ground is 5,000 yuan, and the award for thinking of ways to wash locomotives with alkali substitutes is 1,000 to 5,000 yuan. Clear goals are set, and the masses are guided forward purposefully and in a planned manner. The proposals should be clear and specific, pointing out where to start research, such as where to think of ways to improve tools or improve technology. Give enthusiastic and practical help to the workers who are studying these topics. The successful or adopted suggestions should be announced on site at any time, on the one hand, to spread this experience, and on the other hand, to avoid duplication and waste of manpower and material resources.
    Third, the combination of technical personnel and workers.
    Strengthen technical education among workers, improve the technical level and scientific knowledge of the workers, summarize their experience, and enlighten their wisdom. Encourage technical personnel to go deep into the site, learn practical operating experience, and combine workers and technical personnel to help each other, learn from each other's strengths, and combine theory with practice, which may play a greater role. For example, the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant cooperated with workers and technical personnel to solve the technical problem of coal powder leakage. Only in this way can the rationalization proposal movement among the workers be improved one step further.
    Fourth, correctly implement the reward system.
    For the suggestions that have been adopted, appropriate proportions of bonuses should be given according to the value it generates and the amount of cost reduction. Combine the political awareness of the workers with material incentives, and individual interests with social interests. Even for relatively small suggestions, praise should be given. Naturally, the development of rationalization proposals depends on the political awareness of the broad masses of workers, but if the rewards are "only punishments and no rewards, and the suggestions are reasonable but the rewards are unreasonable," the movement cannot be more widespread. The Tianjin Railway Administration did not reward in a timely manner in the past. From March 8 to May 8 this year, it received 100 suggestions. After timely rewards, it received 577 suggestions from May 8 to June 20, which was nearly five times more than before. This shows that correct and timely rewards have a significant effect on promoting rationalization proposals.
    The State Council has promulgated the Provisional Regulations on Guaranteeing Invention Rights and Patent Rights and the Measures for Rewarding Production Inventions, Technological Improvements, and Rationalization Proposals. The development of the rationalization proposal campaign has legal and material guarantees, which will greatly stimulate the enthusiasm of the workers and create more favorable conditions to improve the work one step further. Therefore, it is necessary to implement the spirit of the State Council's decision and resolutely implement this reward system.
    In short, opening up the thinking of cadres, establishing mass viewpoints, dispelling the ideological concerns of the workers, formulating topics to point out the direction, advocating the combination of technical personnel and workers, resolutely implementing the reward system stipulated by the State Council, clarifying the responsibilities of trade unions and the administration in the rationalization proposal work, dividing labor and assisting, and strengthening leadership are the basic keys to carrying out the mass rationalization proposal movement at present. Grasp these key issues and solve them appropriately, so that the mass rationalization proposal movement can be widely carried out to achieve the goal of continuously improving labor productivity and promoting the rapid recovery and development of the national economy.

　　广泛开展合理化建议运动
    中华全国总工会生产部部长  董昕
    中国人民革命取得了伟大胜利，工人阶级从被压迫的奴隶地位解放出来，变成了国家的主人。由于政治觉悟的不断提高，广大的工人群众，能够自觉地替全国人民打算，替国家打算。可以想办法，出主意，去克服当前经济建设中的困难，提高劳动生产率，为国家创造更多的财富，逐渐地把贫穷的农业国变为富强的工业国。也只有在社会主义与新民主主义政权下，被反动统治阶级所埋没、摧残、限制的无数的天才才有可能被发现，劳动人民的无比的智慧才能得到充分的发挥，在生产建设中表现其高度的积极性与创造性。在这个前题下，才可能提出广泛地开展群众发明，技术改进与合理化建议运动，作为群众生产工作中的重要内容之一。
    群众发明，技术改进与合理化建议是苏联的先进经验。首先是在旅大及东北地区推行，关内京、津、沪等主要城市某些企业，也先后学习这些经验，初步开展了这一工作。事实证明，不论任何企业部门，只要领导上加以重视，给以引导，工人群众就会立刻提出许多改善管理，改进技术，克服困难，提高产量与质量，降低成本，各方面的宝贵建议，以及创造发明。工人群众这种热情，就必然成为恢复与发展生产中的原动力。合理化建议运动一经展开，立即创造巨大的经济效果，东北在创造新纪录运动中，就有合理化建议三千六百八十三件。据东北总工会一九四九年上半年的统计，工人提出建议一、三七七件，其中七○五件所创造的价值即达四百余亿东北币。旅大地区自一九四七年开展合理化建议运动后，至一九四九年，三年中，工人提出建议采纳实施者二千六百件，由于建议所节约的价值，共二、七九五、一四一、六九九元（关东币）。北京石景山发电厂，改进煤粉装置克服跑粉现象，每年节省小米一、一四三、四○○斤。这就是有力的证明。
    目前，在全国范围内，无论老区或新区，一切公私企业部门，都有开展这一运动的客观条件，那就是：工人阶级的觉悟普遍提高；劳动人民中蕴藏着无限丰富的经验与无比的智慧；政府颁布了奖励有关生产发明，技术改进，合理化建议决定，保障发明权专利权的法令与奖励办法；工会组织确定了领导这一工作的机构，规定了具体的方针与任务。不过发明创造，是须有较高的科学知识，技术水平，目前立即发展为广泛的群众性的运动还有困难，但技术改进与合理化建议运动，则能普遍的大规模开展起来。这一运动的开展应与当前的生产情况，具体的任务密切结合。比如，在东北可以围绕着创造新纪录运动，推广集体合同，改善经营管理，贯彻责任制，团结技术人员，加强技术学习，去巩固与提高群众发明，技术改进与合理化建议运动；在关内地区则可以结合改进旧企业，制定初步定额，建立经济核算制，来开展合理化建议；新解放区则可以在克服困难，维持与恢复生产中开展合理化建议运动。总的目标是要经过这一运动切实地组织与动员工人，工程技术人员以及管理人员，充实生产竞赛的内容，搞好生产工作。使工人群众的劳动热忱与科学技术相结合，更有效地提高劳动生产率。
    根据东北、华北几个主要地区，某些企业单位的经验，要开展合理化建议运动，必须解决下述几个问题：
    首先，打通思想，依靠群众。
    各地经验证明，在工人群众中进行反复的宣传，去掉各种顾虑，领导上树立明确的依靠群众的观点，了解合理化建议的重大意义与作用，是开展工作的首要条件，就目前实际情况来看，基本上存在着四种不正确的思想：
    一、没有认识合理化建议，是工厂管理民主化一项最重要的具体内容，是工人群众新的劳动态度的表现，是生产竞赛的重要形式，是提高生产率的群众路线的方法。某些行政与工会干部认为合理化建议是“技术”问题，未予以足够的重视，是不妥当的，他们没有认识到合理化建议运动，就是觉悟了的工人群众，对国家生产建设表示负责的一种具体行动，也是改造旧企业，克服困难，改进技术，提高劳动生产率的群众运动。工会组织如果不善于发动与组织这件工作，就不能达到搞好生产的目的。行政领导对此不加重视，工厂管理民主化，就成为空洞的口号，而漠视发挥工人群众的经验与智慧的结果，必将招致国家经济建设中的损失。
    二、某些技术人员以及行政管理人员对工人群众抱着轻视态度。他们认为这些群众没有受过高等教育，没有可能解决生产中的问题，只有专家和技术人员，才能处理生产技术上的问题，才能管理企业。于是鄙视工人群众的建议，不去倾听他们的意见，虚心向他们学习，严肃的认真的处理群众的建议，对于工人群众的积极性与创造性，这一伟大的潜在力量，熟视无睹。甚至某些行政人员以及工会干部，对于群众合理化建议，采取了令人不能容忍的、拖延积压甚至不理的官僚主义的态度。大大的损害了工人群众的积极性，简直是一种犯罪行为。
    同时，受过长期压迫的工人群众，在思想上同样也有许多顾虑，根据石家庄总工会的经验，在开展合理化建议过程中，工人存在着“四怕”：“一、怕厂长工程师吃醋；二、怕别人说风凉话，讽刺说是出风头；三、怕建议不被采纳无法下台；四、怕改掉不合理现象会得罪人。”同样地，在许多工厂中工人中也是存在着这些顾虑，这也必须经过反复地说服教育，打破这些顾虑才能使运动开展。
    三、某些工程技术人员以及有经验的老技术工人中，存在着墨守成规、抱残守缺的技术上的保守主义思想，是开展合理化建议运动的严重障碍。他们迷信英、美、日等资本主义国家以及日本伪满统治时代的水平及所谓理论标准，他们认为那是金科玉律，任何一点也不能违背，而且装腔作势，吓唬群众。自然我们不是根本否定科学理论，但那些理论不是死板的教条，因为科学理论是劳动人民创造的结果，今天的劳动人民，还可以打破陈规，创造出更多的奇迹来。
    四、对微小的建议不重视，不采取欢迎的态度，大连一位厂长说：“过去有工人对生产提出些改进的意见，我总问能提高效率百分之几百，若不能提高一倍或节省一倍的人工就拉倒了。”要求过高，工人中即或有些改进意见，觉得值不得甚么，或则根本不理，既不表扬，也不推广，也就不计算其价值，打击了群众情绪。因此，必须采取十分严肃的态度，对待工人的每一个建议，而且应主动地积极地领导与帮助工人群众研究生产中的问题，鼓励他们提出建议，不能采纳的建议，也必须及时向工人群众解释清楚，不能搁在一边不理。
    其次，拟订课题，指出方向。
    有计划有组织的开展合理化建议运动，企业领导者应根据生产需要，或某种生产上的缺陷，须待解决的问题，拟订“课题”。旅大有的工厂采用课题板方式，向全厂职工提出课题征求建议，有的采取技术悬赏、“招功”方式，征求建议，大连中长铁路工厂，曾根据各个职场工作需要提出，技术悬赏如像电气场提出：研究用新的创造方法所制电滚用的轴瓦挂五金的用具时奖五千元，对车场提出：能在平地试验机车注水器者奖五千元，想办法用火碱代用品洗机车者奖一千元至五千元，规定明确的目标，有目的，有计划的引导群众前进。课题的提出要明确具体，指出从何着手研究，如像应该在改进工具，或是改进技术方面去想办法等，对于研究这些课题的工人给以热诚的切实的帮助。对于已成功或采用的建议，要随时通告现场，一面传播这个经验，另外也可以避免重复，浪费人力物力。
    第三，技术人员与工人结合。
    加强工人中的技术教育，提高工人群众的技术水平与科学知识，总结他们的经验，启发他们的智慧。鼓励技术人员深入现场，学习实际操作经验，使工人与技术人员结合起来，互相帮助，取长补短，理论与实际结合，这就可能发挥更大的作用，如北京石景山发电厂，工人与技术人员合作解决了跑煤粉的技术问题。只有如此，才能把工人群众中的合理化建议运动，提高一步。
    第四，正确执行奖励制度。
    对于已被采用的建议，均应按它所产生的价值与降低成本的多少给予适当比例的奖金。把工人群众的政治觉悟与物质鼓励、个人利益与社会利益结合起来。就是对于比较小的建议，也要给以表扬。自然，合理化建议的开展，要依靠广大工人群众的政治觉悟，但对于奖励采取“只见处罚下，不见奖励来，建议合理，奖励不合理”，就不能使运动规模更加广泛。天津铁路管理局，过去奖励不及时。从今年三月八日到五月八日收到建议一○○件，经过及时奖励后，从五月八日到六月二十日收到五七七件，超出以前将近五倍，由此可见，正确及时的奖励，对于推动合理化建议有重大作用。
    政务院颁布了保障发明权与专利权暂行条例与有关生产发明，技术改进与合理化建议奖励办法。使开展合理化建议运动，有了法律上与物质上的保障，这将大大刺激工人群众的积极性，造成更有利的条件，把工作提高一步，因此，就必须贯彻政务院决定精神，坚决执行这种奖励制度。
    总之，打通干部思想，树立群众观点，解除工人群众的思想顾虑；拟订课题指明方向；提倡技术人员与工人群众结合；坚决执行政务院规定的奖励制度；明确工会与行政在合理化建议工作中的职责，分工协助，加强领导，是当前开展群众性的合理化建议运动的基本关键。把握这些关键问题，予以适当的解决，这才可能把群众合理化建议运动广泛开展起来，达到不断地提高劳动生产率，促进国民经济迅速的恢复与发展的目的。
