　　Beijing Middle Schools Combine Coursework to Conduct In-Depth Anti-America Ideological Education
    You Qiong
    [Our Newspaper] The large-scale propaganda work of the Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Home, Defend the Country movement in Beijing's middle schools has come to a close, and schools have resumed classes one after another. In the future, we will enter a stage of persistence, consolidation, and deepening, to closely integrate the Resist America, Aid Korea movement with teaching, thoroughly eliminate the pro-America, worship-America ideas and mentality of some faculty, staff, and students, and further strengthen the viewpoints of patriotism and internationalism.

    After schools launched a wave of enthusiasm for the Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Home, Defend the Country movement through discussion meetings, accusation meetings, and other methods, teachers and students generally improved their political and ideological understanding through current affairs studies. They recognized that American imperialism is a "paper tiger," that the atomic bomb is not scary, and that the forces of the peace camp are strong. They established relatively clear viewpoints of patriotism and internationalism. School administrations have further clarified that education serves the country's current political tasks, and that ideological education against imperialism is an important part of the new democratic education policy. They recognized the importance of this movement and believed that this movement is an important way to carry out education on loving the motherland and loving the people. Therefore, they adopted a positive support and close cooperation attitude towards the patriotic movement of students, so that the movement could be smoothly promoted. Many teachers, influenced by the enthusiasm of the students, actively participated in the Resist America, Aid Korea activities, helping students in various aspects, and in turn guiding the movement and promoting the movement, which was supported and loved by the students.

    Many schools have created good experiences in the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda movement. For example, the administrative leadership of Municipal No. 8 Middle School clearly recognized the importance of this movement at the beginning of the movement, appropriately convened various meetings at different times, and timely solved existing problems, so that the work could proceed smoothly. Girls' No. 3 Middle School put forward the slogan "Defend World Peace, Support Korea" when the Korean War broke out, and paid attention to students' study of current affairs in the summer school, laying a relatively deep foundation for the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. The "Youth League" of Municipal No. 4 Middle School conducted propaganda through mass meetings, speeches, and visits. The largest number of participants in mass meetings reached 1,500 people. Through the activities of the "Youth League," the patriotic enthusiasm of teachers and students throughout the school was encouraged, and they actively exercised to prepare to dedicate themselves to the motherland at any time. Yucai Middle School held an exhibition of Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Home, Defend the Country, divided into six pavilions, including: "Why Can't We Ignore the US Imperialist Aggression Against Korea?" "Why is US Imperialism Our Most Ferocious and Cruel Enemy?" "Why is US Imperialism the Enemy of the Whole World?" "The Decaying United States" "Why is US Imperialism a Paper Tiger?" "Our Attitude" and so on. Students collected relevant materials from various sources, sorted, classified, and made their own models and charts. This exhibition educated others and also educated themselves. Some students said: "The harvest of preparing for this meeting is really great."

    In order to further and more extensively carry out the Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Home, Defend the Country movement in the future, schools have decided to start from the following aspects to further strengthen students' political and ideological education and strengthen the study of faculty and staff.

    1. Adjustment of curriculum materials: In order to cooperate with the long-term patriotic movement of Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Home, Defend the Country, curriculum materials should be appropriately combined with the movement. For example, in language classes, the joint declarations of various democratic parties and news reports and literary works related to Resist America, Aid Korea in newspapers and magazines can be taught; in history classes, flexible adjustments can be made, such as teaching modern history in advance for those who teach ancient history and medieval history, with the history of American aggression against China as the focus; geography classes can explain the aggressive nature of American imperialism from the perspective of the military and economic expansion policies of American imperialism; political classes should strengthen the ideological education of patriotism and internationalism in an organized and planned manner, and appropriately organize special reports based on students' ideological situation. Other subjects such as physical education, music, and art can also be coordinated with the movement. As for mathematics, physics, chemistry, and other subjects, those that can be combined should be combined, and those that cannot be combined should appropriately adjust the progress and simplify homework, so as not to affect students' patriotic movement work. At the same time, phenomena such as disrupting the curriculum, canceling courses, or randomly selecting teaching materials should also be prevented.

    2. Content of extracurricular activities: The center of extracurricular activities is the patriotic movement. Other activities should be subordinate to this movement. School administrations should help students collect relevant materials and guide students to study problems in a planned and systematic way.

    3. School administration and faculty and staff study issues: In the future, the study of administration, faculty and staff should focus on current affairs study and research on patriotic issues, closely combined with mass movements, and strengthen the leading role of teachers in the movement.

    4. Education method issues: Schools should use various different methods to conduct education appropriately according to students' different ideological situations and different levels of awareness, and should not proceed subjectively from the leadership's requirements. More methods of enlightenment, guidance, and persuasion should be used, and positive praise and encouragement should be given. (You Qiong)

　　京市中等学校结合课业
    深入进行抗美思想教育
    有琼
    【本报讯】京市中等学校抗美援朝保家卫国运动的出动宣传工作已告一段落，各校均相继复课。今后将进入坚持、巩固和深入的阶段，使抗美援朝运动与教学密切结合，彻底肃清部分教职员及学生中恐美、崇美的思想和心理，进一步加强爱国主义与国际主义的观点。
    各校通过讨论会，控诉会等方式普遍地掀起了抗美援朝保家卫国运动的热潮后，师生经过时事学习，一般地在政治、思想上都提高了一步，认识到美帝是“纸老虎”，原子弹不可怕，和平阵营力量的强大等。建立了较明确的爱国主义和国际主义的观点。学校行政上进一步明确了教育是服务于国家当前的政治任务，而反对帝国主义的思想教育是新民主主义教育方针重要的一部分，认识了这个运动的重要性，同时认为这个运动正是进行爱祖国、爱人民的教育的重要方式。因而对学生这一爱国运动采取了积极支持和密切配合的态度，使运动得以顺利推进。许多教员受学生热情的影响，积极参加了抗美援朝的活动，从各方面帮助学生，进而指导了运动，推进了运动，受到学生的拥护与爱戴。
    许多学校在抗美援朝宣传运动中并创造了很好的经验。如市立八中行政领导在运动开始时便明确地认识到这一运动的重要，在各个不同的时期，适当地召开各种会议，及时解决了存在的问题。使工作能顺利进行。女三中从朝鲜战争爆发时便提出了“保卫世界和平，支援朝鲜”的口号，在暑期学园中即注意同学对时事的学习，为抗美援朝的运动打下了比较深厚的基础。市立四中“青年连”通过群众大会、讲演和访问等方式进行宣传。参加群众会的最多时曾达一千五百人。通过“青年连”的活动，鼓舞了全校师生的爱国情绪，积极锻炼身体，准备随时献身祖国。育英中学举办了抗美援朝保家卫国的展览会，分为六个馆，内容包括：“我们为什么对美帝侵略朝鲜不能置之不理？”“为什么美帝是我们最凶暴残忍的敌人？”“为什么美帝是全世界的敌人？”“腐烂的美国”“为什么美帝是纸老虎？”“我们的态度”等。同学们从各方面搜集有关材料，整理，分类，并自制模型，图表。这个展览会教育了别人，同时也教育了自己，有些同学说：“筹备这个会的收获真是大。”
    各校为了今后更广泛深入地展开抗美援朝保家卫国的运动，决定从下列几方面着手，进一步加强对学生的政治思想教育，加强教职员的学习。
    一、课程教材的调整：为了配合长期抗美援朝保家卫国的爱国运动，课程教材应适当的与运动结合。如语文课可讲授各民主党派联合宣言与报纸杂志上有关抗美援朝的通讯报道及文艺作品等；历史课可机动调整，如讲上古史、中古史的可提前讲近代史，以美国侵华史为重点；地理课可从美帝的军事和经济的扩张政策来说明美帝的侵略；政治课更要有组织、有计划地加强爱国主义和国际主义的思想教育，并根据学生思想情况，适当地组织专题报告。其他如体育、音乐、美术等科，都能配合运动进行。至于数、理、化等科，能结合的结合，不能结合的应适当调整进度和精简作业，使不致影响同学爱国运动的工作。同时亦应防止打乱课程，取消课程或乱选教材的现象。
    二、课外活动的内容：课外活动的中心是爱国运动。其他的活动均应服从于这一运动。学校行政应帮助同学搜集有关资料，指导同学有计划、有系统地研究问题。
    三、学校行政与教职员学习问题：今后行政和教职员的学习应以时事学习与爱国主义问题的研究为中心。与群众运动密切结合。加强教师在运动中的主导作用。
    四、教育方法问题：各校应根据学生不同的思想情况，不同觉悟程度，适当地用各种不同方式来进行教育，不能从领导上主观要求出发。多采用启发、诱导、说服的方法，积极地进行表扬与鼓励。  （有琼）
