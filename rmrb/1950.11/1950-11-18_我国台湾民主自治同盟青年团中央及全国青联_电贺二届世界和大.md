    Cable Congratulates the Second World Peace Congress
    [Our Newspaper] The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League cabled congratulations on the opening of the Second World Peace Congress. The cable stated:
    At this time, when countries headed by US imperialism are frantically slaughtering peaceful people in Korea, invading our territory of Taiwan and Northeast China, expanding aggression and enslaving the people of all Asia, and creating an emergency for a Third World War, representatives of the world's truly peace-loving people are gathering in Warsaw to hold a congress. We warmly support the congress, celebrate its success, and resolutely strive to realize the Stockholm Declaration.

Now that US imperialism is frantically invading Korea and China, Chinese youth are determined to take active actions to resist US imperialist aggression, support the Korean people, defend the motherland, and defend world peace. We sincerely wish the Second Peace Congress success.
