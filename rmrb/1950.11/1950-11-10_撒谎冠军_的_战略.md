　　The "Strategic Plan" of the "Lying Champion"
    林淡秋

    I remember that in the March 1st issue of *Time* magazine this year, there was a short article saying that the American "Liars' Club," in celebration of its 20th anniversary, held an international lying competition to determine the world lying champion. At the start of the competition, the club's chairman, Otis Harlett, said in his address: "Lying is a great art, a great sport, and we hope to discover many new talents this year!"

    I don't know how the competition turned out, or whether it really "discovered many new talents." But I think: if Truman, Acheson, Austin and their ilk were to participate in this competition to promote their "American way of life," then the "new talents" that the chairman of the "Liars' Club" "hoped" for would all be disappointed. Because no matter how much they promote lying as a "great art" or conduct the "great sport" of lying, it would be difficult for many "new talents" to surpass Truman and his gang of old warmongers and win the championship of "World Lying Champion."

    However, Truman and his ilk probably wouldn't openly participate in this competition, because they are still important officials such as the "President" and "Secretary of State" of the United States, and they don't dare to openly admit to the American people and the people of the world that they are lying experts; they can only say that their aggressive actions are to realize America's "noble ideals": to destroy the peaceful construction of the liberated countries and enslave the people of the whole world. In fact, they are not only liars, but also blatant robbers. There are countless examples. Austin's recent "statement" is a brand new masterpiece:

    "I am confident in my own heart that every well-informed person in the world – including the leaders of Communist China – knows what our troops will do when they reach the northern border of Korea. They will stop.

    "Once peace is restored and measures are taken to ensure the implementation of the UN decision, they will all leave Korea.

    "We have no aggressive ambitions against any country, and Communist China is no exception. This should be unnecessary to say, because it is very obvious. But in case there is any doubt, let me say it again now. Let me remind you: President Truman and other American leaders have repeatedly said this." (American News Agency, Success Lake, 3rd Dispatch)

    This is the most shameless "great art" of the US representative to the United Nations General Assembly, and the clumsiest "strategy" of "President Truman and other American leaders." When the raging flames of aggression created by the US imperialists with planes and cannons burned down the peaceful cities and villages of Korea, burned to the border of our motherland, and even repeatedly burned into our country, the US imperialist representative still shamelessly said, "We have no aggressive ambitions against any country"!

    "Every well-informed person in the world" has long seen through the internal organs of you warmongers, and seen through your "strategic" intentions: Chinese people, you don't need to resist America, you don't need to aid Korea, even the outposts on the Manchurian border are unnecessary. The Yalu River is enough for you to defend your homeland, because "they will stop." What will "stop" do? Stop to "take measures to ensure the implementation of the UN (!) decision", so that the US imperialists and their running dog Syngman Rhee can ensure their rule over Korea on a sea of blood and corpses, and then "they will all leave Korea."

    Okay, let us expose this "strategic plan" of "stopping" and "leaving."

    "Stopping" is possible, because as Austin said in the same "statement," after "fighting the toughest battles for several months," "naturally they should take a rest." They had also "stopped" for a day or two before crossing the 38th parallel, but probably because they were "confident in their own hearts" that nothing would happen after crossing the 38th parallel, they "ordered US and British troops to advance rapidly towards the Manchurian border." Of course, after "measures have been taken to ensure the implementation of the UN (!) decision," they will also "leave Korea." However, the question is, where will they go after "leaving Korea"? The US imperialist representative has not answered this question for the time being, but Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka's memorial to the throne, the actual actions of Japanese soldiers, US Secretary of the Navy Matthews' speech in Boston, MacArthur's statement to the Overseas Veterans Association, the secret documents of the "Korea-US Agreement" seized by the Korean People's Army, and the actual "measures" such as the US invading Korea and occupying Taiwan, all "very clearly" answer this question. If anyone still has "the slightest doubt," then Austin and his ilk will use actual actions to "remind everyone": go to Manchuria! Go to North China! Go to Vietnam! ... At this time, the "World Lying Champions" will say some other reasons.

　　“撒谎冠军”的“战略”
    林淡秋
    记得本年三月一日出版的《时代》杂志上登过一篇短文章，说美国“撒谎俱乐部”为了庆祝自己二十周年纪念日，特地举行了国际撒谎比赛，以确定世界撒谎冠军。比赛开始时，该俱乐部主席奥帝斯·哈莱特致词道：“撒谎是一种大艺术，一种伟大的运动，我们希望在今年发现许多新人才！”
    我不知道这个比赛的结果如何，不知道到底有没有“发现许多新人才”。但我想：如果杜鲁门、艾奇逊、奥斯汀之流为了宣扬其“美国生活方式”而参加这个比赛的话，那么“撒谎俱乐部”主席所“希望”其他“新人才”全会失望。因为无论如何提倡撒谎“大艺术”、进行撒谎的“伟大运动”，很难使许多“新人才”能够超过杜鲁门这批老战争贩子们而取得“世界撒谎冠军”的锦标的。
    不过杜鲁门之流大概不会公开参加这个比赛的，因为他们还是美国的“总统”、“国务卿”等这样重要官员，还不敢向美国人民和全世界人民公开承认自己是撒谎专家；只能说，他们的侵略行动是为了实现美国的“高尚理想”：摧毁已获解放的国家的和平建设，奴役全世界的人民。事实上，他们不仅是撒谎者，而且是明火执仗的强盗。例子是举不胜举的。奥斯汀在最近发表的“声明”，就是一篇崭新的代表作：
    “我在我自己的心中有把握相信：世界上每一个消息灵通的人士——我把共产党中国的领袖们也包括在内——都知道：当我们的部队抵达朝鲜北部边境时，我们的部队将要做什么。他们要停下来。
    “一旦和平恢复，并且采取了措施保证联合国决定的实施，他们都要离开朝鲜的。
    “我们对任何国家都没有侵略野心，而共产党中国也不是例外。这该是不必要说的话，因为这是非常明显的。但是恐怕还有丝毫的疑惑，我现在再说一下。让我提醒各位：总统杜鲁门与其他美国领袖们也已再三地说过这事了。”（美国新闻处成功湖三日电）
    这是美国出席联合国大会的代表最无耻的“大艺术”，是“总统杜鲁门与其他美国领袖们”最拙劣的“战略”。当美帝用飞机大炮造成的熊熊的侵略火焰烧毁了朝鲜的和平城市和乡村，烧到了我们祖国的边境，甚至一再烧进了我们的国境时，美帝的代表却仍然厚着脸皮说“我们对任何国家都没有侵略野心”！
    “世界上每一个消息灵通的人士”都早已看穿了你们这批战争贩子的五脏六腑，看穿了你们的“战略”意图：中国人呀，你们不必抗美，无须援朝，连满洲边境上的哨岗也是不必要的。一条鸭绿江尽够你们保家卫国了，因为“他们要停下来”。“停下来”干什么呢？停下来“采取措施保证联合国（！）决定的实施”，让美帝及其走狗李承晚们在血海尸山上确保了对朝鲜统治之后，于是“他们都要离开朝鲜的”。
    好，让我们来拆穿这“停下来”和“离开”的“战略”吧。
    “停下来”是可能的，因为正如奥斯汀在同一“声明”中所说的，他们在“打了几个月最艰苦的仗”以后，“自然应该休息一下”。他们在越过三八线以前，也曾“停”过一二天，但大概因为“在自己心中有把握相信”越过三八线不会发生什么问题，又“命令美英部队向满洲边境疾进”了。当然，到了“采取了措施保证联合国（！）决定的实施”之后，也会“离开朝鲜”的。不过，问题就在于“离开朝鲜”之后到那里去呢？这位美帝的代表暂时没有回答这个问题，但日本田中首相的奏折，日本兵的实际行动，美国海军部长马休斯在波士顿的演说，麦克阿瑟致海外退伍军人协会的声明书，被朝鲜人民军缴获的“韩美协定”等密件，以及美侵略军进攻朝鲜、占领台湾等实际“措施”，都是“非常明显”地回答了这个问题。如果谁还有“丝毫的疑惑”，那么奥斯汀之流就会用实际行动来“提醒各位”：到满洲去！到华北去！到越南去！………。这时候，“世界撒谎冠军”们就会另外说些理由了。
