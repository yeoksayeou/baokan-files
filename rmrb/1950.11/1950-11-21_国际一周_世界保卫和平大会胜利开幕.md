　　International Week
    World Peace Congress Successfully Opens
    The Second World Peace Congress, awaited by the world, has opened victoriously in Warsaw, the capital of Poland, on the 16th. Outstanding representatives from various countries, carrying the entrustment and hope of progressive people all over the world, will discuss effective steps to further mobilize the people of the world to defend the cause of peace.

    The Second World Peace Congress is being convened at a time when the US imperialists are frantically igniting the flames of aggression, and when peace supporters are jointly striking at the aggressive bandits. The distinct characteristic of the congress is that the current urgent task of defending peace cannot be separated from the practical actions of resisting aggression. Since the Standing Committee Executive Bureau of the World Peace Congress issued a call in August to prepare for the holding of a peace conference in response to the tense situation caused by the US imperialist's launching of a war of aggression in Korea, and put forward a peace program centered on banning murderous weapons and opposing aggression, people all over the world with different beliefs and opinions, in view of the mad ambition of the US bandits to aggress and the monstrous crimes committed by the American beasts in Korea, have increasingly stood under the banner of peace and taken organized actions to save the cause of peace. During this period, the number of people who signed in support of the Stockholm Peace Appeal, that is, those who support the prohibition of atomic weapons and declare the first government to use atomic weapons a war criminal, has surged to more than 500 million. 500 million people have jointly recognized that US imperialism is the public enemy of peaceful humanity, and the steps it has taken have threatened the survival of mankind. Peace supporters are convening a conference at this time to announce this fact to the people of the world and call on the people to make full preparations to meet the aggressors. Peace supporters once again issued a solemn warning: war criminals who are willing to be enemies of mankind will surely be subject to the just trial of the people.

    The profound impact that the Second World Peace Congress will have on the world has aroused great fear among the imperialists. Under the direction of US imperialism, the British Labour government has exhausted all means to sabotage the holding of the conference in Britain. According to materials published by the Electric Communication Agency, Attlee had already made detailed plans in mid-September to obstruct and disrupt the conference. On the eve of the conference, the British government successively refused entry to personnel of the preparatory committee, refused to issue entry visas to members of the Standing Committee and most of the representatives, and even used secret police to threaten and persecute peace envoys arriving in Britain, not hesitating to use unprecedented tyrannical means to stifle the voice of mankind's demand for peace. But the imperialists have only made futile efforts. With the warm welcome of the Polish people and the Polish government, the conference has been successfully moved to Warsaw. The unreasonable behavior of the British government and the complete exposure of the imperialists' face of hostility towards peace, in addition to arousing angry protests from the British people and the people of the world, can only help the peace-loving people to become more vigilant and strengthen unity.

    The victorious opening of the conference in Warsaw is a symbol of the unprecedentedly strong international solidarity of peace fighters all over the world. According to the agenda of the conference, the peace envoys will listen to and discuss reports on expanding the peace movement and universal disarmament, and will discuss major issues such as the prohibition of atomic weapons, the prohibition of war propaganda, the establishment of normal international economic and cultural relations, and the definition of the concept of aggression in various special committees. Therefore, the solemn resolutions passed by the conference will inevitably lead the peace movement to a higher stage, and will inevitably further mobilize and unite all peace-loving people to completely strike at any aggressive conspiracy of US imperialism, the enemy of peace.

    The Korean War Situation Begins to Improve
    On the Korean battlefield, thanks to the heroic fighting of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the aggressive arrogance of the US aggressor army has begun to be severely hit. On the Northwest Korean front, with the participation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the People's Army forces annihilated and defeated a total of twenty-four battalions of the US and Li aggressor armies in the half-month operation from October 25 to November 8, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 13,000 US and Li officers and soldiers, and recovering ten cities and vast rural areas, forcing the enemy to retreat south of the Chongchon River. In the nine days from the 9th to the 17th, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army killed, wounded, and captured more than 1,500 US and Li troops. Behind enemy lines, because the US aggressors' front line is too long and the rear is empty, the Korean People's Guerrilla are everywhere attacking the enemy in vast areas. The People's Guerrilla can not only threaten the enemy's transportation lines from Busan to Seoul and from Seoul to Pyongyang with dispersed activities, but also carry out some more concentrated operations. On November 11, the People's Guerrilla surrounded and attacked a battalion of Li Seung-man's puppet army in Pyonggang-ri, northeast of Seoul.

    Under the joint attack of the people of China and Korea, the weakness of the US aggressors' excessively long supply line is becoming increasingly apparent. Although the cold winter wind and snow have arrived, due to serious difficulties in supply and replenishment, most of the US aggressors and the armies of their servant countries are still wearing summer clothing, "shivering in single trenches, next to vehicles" (Reuters), facing "the extreme danger of frozen hands, feet, and faces" (Associated Press). This situation has led to a decline in the morale of the enemy army, a growing mood of complaints and dissatisfaction, and the phenomenon of self-harm in an attempt to leave the front line has occurred. The difficulties of the US aggressors in the Korean War are increasing.

    However, the current improvement in the Korean war situation is only a beginning. The imperialists have only begun to be hit, and they have not relaxed their original aggression plan. Up to now, the US aggressors and their servant countries still have eight divisions of US regular troops and other special forces, as well as Li Seung-man's puppet army, the British Group, and some mercenaries from servant countries such as Turkey, Thailand, and the Philippines on the Korean battlefield. With such forces, the US and Li aggressors still have the possibility of invading at any time, and in fact, they are preparing to do so. Therefore, in order to finally defeat the aggressors, the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, fighting side by side on the Korean battlefield, still face serious and arduous battles. However, the united efforts of the people of China and Korea, with the assistance of the people of the world, will surely be able to finally and completely defeat the US aggressors.

    Slander, Deception, Intimidation, to No Avail
    Since the great movement of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country has unfolded among our people, and our People's Volunteer Army has fought side by side with the Korean People's Army and severely damaged the US aggressor army, US imperialism has felt great panic about this, and has therefore continuously issued shameless slanders, deceptions, and intimidations against the Chinese people, attempting to stop the righteous act of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to assist the Korean people in driving away the US aggressors, and attempting to create an excuse to once again steal the name of the United Nations, further expand the war, and openly invade China.

    On November 6, MacArthur, the commander-in-chief of the US invading army in Korea and a war criminal, issued a communique and submitted an illegal report to the UN Security Council, falsely accusing the righteous actions of the Chinese people of foreign "intervention." On November 8, the United States hijacked the Security Council to illegally discuss MacArthur's so-called report. On the 12th, the United States, together with Britain, France, Norway, Cuba, and Ecuador, jointly submitted a so-called six-nation proposal to the Security Council supporting the expansion of the US war of aggression in Korea and opposing the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. US representative Austin further delivered a lengthy statement at the meeting, on the one hand, hypocritically arguing that the United States had "no territorial ambitions" towards China, but at the same time, threatening that "the current conflict may not be limited to the Korean region." On November 15 and 16, Acheson and Truman also personally came forward, repeating the rhetoric of MacArthur, Austin, and others, and continuing to slander, deceive, and intimidate the Chinese people.

    But all these tricks of slander, deception, and intimidation are to no avail. They can neither distort nor hinder the great righteous actions of the Chinese people to resist US aggression and aid Korea and protect their homes and defend their country. On the contrary, they can only more thoroughly expose the ugly face of the US aggressors, expose how panicked, at a loss, and fearful the US aggressors are in the face of the Chinese people's powerful will, thereby further arousing the Chinese people's common hatred and making the Chinese people more convinced that in order to demand peace and security, the only way is to severely strike the aggressors and force the aggressors to yield.

    In response to all these slanders, deceptions, and intimidations, our Central People's Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has given a strong rebuttal on behalf of the will of the people of the whole country. Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai solemnly stated on November 11 that he refused to participate in the Security Council's discussion of MacArthur's illegal report. Our Foreign Ministry spokesman also severely criticized MacArthur's and Austin's absurd remarks on the same day, pointing out that the aggressor is US imperialism itself, pointing out that to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, foreign intervention troops must first withdraw from Korea, and pointing out that the Chinese people will never bow their heads in the face of any aggressor's intimidation. Now, the people of the whole of China are supporting the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and democratic public opinion all over the world is cheering for the righteous actions of the Chinese people. Therefore, all the slanders, deceptions, and intimidations of US imperialism, apart from complete failure, will not get any other results.

### 国际一周  世界保卫和平大会胜利开幕

　　国际一周
    世界保卫和平大会胜利开幕
    举世瞩望的第二届世界保卫和平大会，已经于十六日在波兰的首都华沙开幕了。各国人民的优秀代表，带着全世界进步人类的嘱托与希望，将商讨进一步动员全世界人民保卫和平事业的有效步骤。
    第二届世界保卫和平大会，是在美帝国主义者疯狂点燃侵略火焰的时候，在和平拥护者一致协同打击侵略强盗的时候召开的。大会所具有的鲜明特色，就是保卫和平的当前急务，已与反抗侵略的实际行动不能分开。自从八月间世界保卫和平大会常设委员会执行局针对美帝国主义在朝鲜发动侵略战争所造成的紧张局势，发出筹备举行和平大会的号召，提出以禁止杀人武器和反对侵略为中心的和平纲领之后，全世界具有不同信仰，不同见解的人们，鉴于美寇疯狂的侵略野心，和美国野兽在朝鲜所犯的滔天罪行，已越来越多地站到和平的旗帜下，采取有组织的行动来拯救和平事业。在这个时期，签名拥护斯德哥尔摩和平宣言的主张，即拥护禁止原子武器、并宣布头一个使用原子武器的政府为战争罪犯的人民，已经激增至五亿以上。五亿人民已共同认识到美帝国主义是和平人类的公敌，它所采取的步骤已威胁了人类的生存。和平拥护者在此时召集大会，便是要向全世界人民宣布这种事实，号召人民进行充分准备来迎击侵略者。和平拥护者再度发出严正的警告：甘与人类为敌的战争罪犯，必将受到人民的正义裁判。
    第二届世界保卫和平大会将在世界上引起的深刻影响，已引起了帝国主义者的极大恐惧。在美帝国主义的指使下，英国的工党政府用尽一切方法来破坏大会在英国举行。根据电通社发表的材料，艾德礼在九月中旬已经作出了阻挠破坏大会的详细计划。在和大举行的前夕，英国政府接连拒绝和大筹备委员会的人员入境，拒发和大常委会委员以及大部分和大代表的入境签证，甚至使用特务警察威胁迫害抵达英国的和平使者，不惜以前所未闻的暴虐手段来窒息人类要求和平的声音。但帝国主义者只是作了徒然的努力。大会在波兰人民和波兰政府的热诚欢迎下，已顺利地移到华沙举行。英国政府的无理行为，帝国主义者仇视和平的面目的彻底暴露，除了引起英国人民和全世界人民的愤怒的抗议之外，其结果只能是有助于和平人民更加提高警惕和加强团结。
    大会在华沙的胜利开幕，是全世界和平战士国际团结空前强大的象征。根据大会议程，和平使者们将听取并讨论关于扩大和平运动和普遍裁减军备的报告，并将在各专门委员会中讨论禁止原子武器、禁止战争宣传、建立国际正常经济与文化关系，以及侵略概念定义等重大问题。因此，大会所通过的庄严决议，必然将使和平运动走向更高的阶段，必然将进一步动员和团结一切爱好和平的人民，彻底打击美帝国主义这个和平敌人的任何侵略阴谋。
    朝鲜战局开始好转
    在朝鲜战场上，由于朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队的英勇作战，已经开始使美国侵略军的侵略气焰受到严重的打击。在朝鲜西北前线，人民军部队在中国人民志愿部队的参加下，在十月二十五日至十一月八日的半个月的作战中，歼灭与击溃了美、李侵略军共二十四个营，毙、伤、俘美、李官兵一万三千余人，收复了城市十座及广大的乡村，迫使敌人退至清川江以南。在九日至十七日的九天中，朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿部队又毙伤俘美、李军一千五百余名。在敌人后方，由于美国侵略者的战线太长，后方空虚，朝鲜人民游击队正在广大的地区中，到处打击敌人。人民游击队不但能以分散的活动，威胁敌人由釜山至汉城，由汉城至平壤的交通线，而且也进行了一些较为集中的作战。十一月十一日，人民游击队即在汉城东北的平康里，包围并打击了李承晚伪军一个营。
    在中朝两国人民的联合打击下，美国侵略者供应线太长的弱点，是日益明显地暴露出来了。虽然严冬的风雪已经降临，但是由于供应和补充的严重困难，美国侵略者及其仆从国家的军队，迄今大多数仍然穿着夏季服装，“在单人战壕里，在车辆旁边发抖”（路透社），面临着“冻手、冻脚、冻脸的极度危险”（美联社）。这种情况，使敌军的士气低落，埋怨和不满的情绪日增，并已发生了自戕以图离开前线的现象。美国侵略者在朝鲜战争中的困难，是愈来愈多了。
    但是，目前朝鲜战局的好转，仅仅只是一个开始，帝国主义者还只是开始受到打击，它们还没有放松它们原来的侵略计划。迄今为止，美国侵略者及其仆从国家，在朝鲜战场上仍有美国正规军及其他特种部队八个师，还有李承晚伪军及英国集团及土耳其、泰国、菲律宾等仆从国家的一部分雇佣兵。在这样的兵力下，美、李侵略者仍有随时进犯的可能，而且事实上他们正在这样地准备着。因此，为了最后击败侵略者，在朝鲜战场上并肩作战的英勇的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队，仍然面临着严重和艰苦的战斗。但是，中朝两国人民团结一致的努力，在世界人民的援助下，一定能够最后地彻底击败美国侵略者。
    诬蔑、欺骗、恐吓、无济于事
    自从我全国人民展开伟大的抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大运动，我人民志愿部队与朝鲜人民军并肩作战并重创美国侵略军以来，美国帝国主义对此已感到极大恐慌，因而不断对中国人民发出了无耻的诬蔑、欺骗与恐吓，妄图以此制止中国人民志愿援助朝鲜人民赶走美国侵略者的义举，并妄图制造借口，再次盗用联合国名义，进一步扩大战争，公开侵略中国。
    十一月六日，美国侵朝军总司令，战争罪犯麦克阿瑟发表公报，并向联合国安理会提出非法报告，诬指中国人民的义举为外国“干涉”。十一月八日，美国劫持安理会非法讨论麦克阿瑟的这个所谓报告，十二日，美国又与英国、法国、挪威、古巴、厄瓜多尔联合在安理会提出支持美国在朝鲜扩大侵略战争并反对中国人民志愿部队的所谓六国提案。美国代表奥斯汀更在会上发表长篇声明，一方面虚伪地强辩美国对中国“并无领土野心”，但同时却又恐吓“目前的冲突可能不限于朝鲜区域”。十一月十五日和十六日，艾奇逊和杜鲁门也亲自出马，重复麦克阿瑟、奥斯汀之流的谰调，继续对中国人民进行诬蔑、欺骗和恫吓。
    但是所有这些诬蔑、欺骗与恐吓的伎俩，都是无济于事的，它既不能歪曲，也不能阻挠中国人民抗美援朝、保家卫国的伟大正义行动，相反地只能更加彻底地暴露美国侵略者丑恶的嘴脸，暴露美国侵略者在中国人民强大意志力量面前如何惊慌失措与恐惧混乱，从而更激起中国人民的同仇敌忾，使中国人民更深信要求得和平与安全，就只有重重地打击侵略者，迫使侵略者屈膝。
    对于这一切的诬蔑、欺骗与恐吓，我中央人民政府外交部已代表全国人民的意志给予了有力的驳斥。周恩来外长已于十一月十一日严正地声明拒绝参加安理会关于麦克阿瑟非法报告的讨论。我外交部发言人并于同日痛斥麦克阿瑟与奥斯汀的荒谬言论，指出侵略者正是美国帝国主义自己，指出要和平解决朝鲜问题首先必须使外国干涉军一律退出朝鲜，指出中国人民决不会在任何侵略者的恐吓面前低下头来。现在，全中国人民都在支持中国人民志愿部队的英勇斗争，全世界的民主舆论都在欢呼中国人民的正义行动，因此，美帝国主义的一切诬蔑、欺骗、恫吓，除了完全失败一途以外，是得不到任何别的结果的。
