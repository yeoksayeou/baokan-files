Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 5th—The people of Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming and other places in the Southwest region are extremely indignant at the mad and aggressive actions of the American imperialists in expanding their war of aggression against Korea. Many young workers, farmers and students have expressed their firm will to resist American aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country.

　　Luo Huarong, a twenty-year-old farmer in Chongqing, said: "I will closely unite with my farmer brothers, do a good job in the spring sowing, actively hand in public grain, and fully support the People's Liberation Army and the Korean people." Public security personnel, primary school teachers, natural science workers, medical workers, and people from industry and commerce have all expressed their unanimous determination to stand firm in their posts and redouble their efforts to support the Korean people, and to widely launch a propaganda movement to resist American aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend the country.

　　Representatives of various democratic parties in Chengdu held a symposium on resisting American aggression and aiding Korea on the 3rd. The participants unanimously agreed: "Korea and our country are as closely related as lips and teeth. We cannot ignore the safety of our neighbors and should do our best to help the Korean people." Chen Xianghe, deputy director of the Preparatory Committee of the Sichuan West Federation of Literary and Art Circles, firmly stated: "In order to oppose American imperialist aggression and support the Korean people, I can contribute everything I have." Workers at the Zhaofeng Flour Mill wrote to the Western Sichuan Daily and said, "Korea is our neighbor. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Korean people helped us fight Japanese imperialism. Now that they are suffering from the crazy aggression of American imperialism, we Chinese people must save our neighbors and save ourselves, and support the Korean people in defeating American imperialism." Fitter Li Wenxin angrily said: "Those turtles' claws want to reach into our Northeast, we must crush them!" Veterans Wang Jun and Zhang Shaoyun, who participated in the Huaihai, Crossing the Yangtze, and Liberation of Southwest China campaigns, jointly stated: "We have long seen through the aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism. If it is not eliminated, we will not have peaceful days. We hope to return to the front line to support the Korean people and defend the motherland."

　　Zhang Yulin, a model worker representative in Kunming, wrote to the Yunnan Daily, expressing his willingness to go to Korea to participate in the Korean people's war against American aggression. The 15th production team of the Kunming Machine Factory is preparing to organize a battlefield service team to go to Korea to help the Korean people in their operations, and wrote letters to General Kim Il-sung and the Korean People's Army to pay their respects. Workers such as Yang Pei from the Telecommunications Bureau expressed their willingness to go to Korea to participate in battlefield telecommunications work. Workers from Yuyun Machine Factory, Wuxing Equipment Manufacturing Factory, and the 51st Ordnance Factory unanimously proposed the need to study military knowledge. The female workers of the Third Group of the Fifth Squadron of the Yunnan Textile Factory Workers Training Class eagerly requested to study nursing work.
