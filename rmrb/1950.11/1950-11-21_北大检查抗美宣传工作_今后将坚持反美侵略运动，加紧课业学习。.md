　　Peking University Reviews Anti-American Propaganda Work
    Will Persist in the Anti-American Aggression Movement and Intensify Studies.
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Peking University Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Opposition to American Aggression held a reporting conference on the work of resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding the home, and defending the country in the Democratic Plaza on the afternoon of the 20th, reviewing the propaganda work of the past two weeks. More than 3,000 teachers, students, staff, and workers of the university and students from Guanghua, Muzhen, and Jingcun schools attended.
    Tang Yongtong, chairman of the conference, pointed out in his speech: Although academic studies have been suspended in the past two weeks, political classes have been strengthened, many problems have been discovered and resolved, and the masses have been helped to solve some problems. Resisting America and aiding Korea is not a short-term matter, so on the one hand, the anti-American aggression movement must be persisted in; on the other hand, in order to defeat the imperialist expansion of the war of aggression, we must improve our abilities, master science and technology, and intensify our academic studies. Therefore, this conference is to review the past propaganda work, not to end this movement, but to further enrich our abilities and continue the movement to resist America and aid Korea.
    Xu Deheng, from the presidium, spoke, emphatically reminding everyone: "In the future, on the one hand, we must study hard in our own positions, but we must always strengthen our vigilance and carry out the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, and regard it as an important task; respond to the government's call at any time and contribute ourselves wholeheartedly to the motherland."
    Zeng Zhaolun, the provost, reported on the work of this stage. The Western Language Department and the Political Science Department reported on this rural propaganda campaign. In addition, the students also performed recreational programs they created during this anti-American propaganda campaign.

　　北大检查抗美宣传工作
    今后将坚持反美侵略运动，加紧课业学习。
    【本报讯】北大保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会于二十日下午在民主广场举行抗美援朝保家卫国宣传工作报告大会，检查两周来的宣传工作。到会全校师生员工及光华、慕贞、竞存三校同学三千余人。
    大会主席汤用彤致词时指出：两周来在业务学习上虽然说是停止了，可是政治课却加强了，发现并解决了许多问题，而且也帮助广大群众解决了一些问题。反美援朝不是短期的事，所以一方面要把反美侵略运动坚持下去；另一方面，为了打败帝国主义的扩大侵略战争，必须提高自己的能力，掌握科学技术，业务课也要加紧学习。因此这次大会是检查过去各种宣传工作，并非结束这个运动，而是更进一步地充实自己的能力，把抗美援朝的运动继续下去。
    主席团许德珩讲话，着重提醒大家：“以后我们一方面要在自己岗位上好好学习，但是必须时时加强警惕，进行抗美援朝的工作，而且要把它当作一个重要的任务；随时响应政府的号召，把自己毫无保留地贡献给祖国。”
    曾昭抡教务长报告了这一阶段的工作。西语系、政治系作了这次下乡宣传的报告。另外还演出了同学们在这次抗美宣传中自己创造的游艺节目。
