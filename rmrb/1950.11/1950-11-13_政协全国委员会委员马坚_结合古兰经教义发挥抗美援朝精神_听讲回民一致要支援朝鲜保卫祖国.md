　　National Committee Member of the CPPCC, Ma Jian
　  Explains the Spirit of Resisting America and Aiding Korea by Combining Quran Teachings
    After Listening, Muslims Unanimously Want to Support Korea to Defend the Motherland
    [Reported by this newspaper] Ma Jian (Hui nationality), member of the National Committee of the First Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and professor of the Department of Oriental Languages at Peking University, was invited to give a speech to the Muslims of the Dongsi Mosque area at 2:00 PM on the 10th, on the issue of Resisting America and Aiding Korea. He explained the spirit of Resisting America and Aiding Korea by combining the teachings of the Quran. He cited Quranic verses to explain that the greatest characteristic of Islam is to teach everyone to do their best to oppose war and support peace. Aggressive war is the greatest sin. Therefore, aggressors should be sanctioned. If one's own country and nation are invaded, they should resist. The meaning of Islam is "peace." If someone endangers peace, they must be eliminated by force. The American invasion of Korea is a destruction of peace. From the perspective of Islamic teachings alone, every Muslim should stand up to resist America and aid Korea. His speech aroused unanimous resentment against American imperialism and patriotic enthusiasm among the Muslims. After the meeting, the Muslims said one after another: "Although we read the newspapers, our understanding of the crimes of American imperialism in invading Korea is not clear enough. This speech made us recognize the aggressive nature of American imperialism and its relationship with religion. We must work hard to support Korea and defend the motherland."

　  结合古兰经教义发挥抗美援朝精神   
    听讲回民一致要支援朝鲜保卫祖国
    【本报讯】第一届中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会委员、北大东语系教授马坚（回族）应邀于十日下午二时，在东四清真寺对该区回民演讲抗美援朝的问题。他结合古兰经教义，发挥了抗美援朝的精神。他援引古兰经经文说明：伊斯兰教最大的特色，是教每个人都尽自己最大力量反对战争，拥护和平。侵略性的战争，是最大的罪恶。故对于侵略者，应当加以制裁。倘若自己的国家民族被人侵略，就应当反抗。伊斯兰的字义就是“和平”。如果有人危害和平，就要用武力消灭它。美国侵略朝鲜就是破坏和平。仅就伊斯兰教义来讲，每个回民也应当起来抗美援朝。他的讲演激起了回民一致对美帝的愤恨和爱国热情。会后，回民纷纷说：“我们虽然看报，但对美帝侵朝罪行认识还不够清楚。这次讲演使我们认清了美帝的侵略本质及其与宗教的关系。我们一定要努力支援朝鲜，保卫祖国。”
