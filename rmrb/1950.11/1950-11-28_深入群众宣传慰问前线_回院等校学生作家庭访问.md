　　Deeply Into the Masses for Propaganda and Comfort to the Front Lines
    Students from Hui College and Other Schools Make Home Visits
    [By Our Newspaper] In order to ensure that the movement to comfort the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is implemented among the citizens, and to make the citizens also recognize the great significance of sending comfort items and writing comfort letters, students from the National Hui College and Girls' No. 5 Middle School conducted home visits on the afternoons of the 25th and 24th respectively. Citizens also expressed their enthusiasm for supporting the Korean front, and voluntarily donated comfort items and wrote comfort letters. Some illiterate people also expressed their desire to entrust others to write letters of comfort to the soldiers on the Korean front.
