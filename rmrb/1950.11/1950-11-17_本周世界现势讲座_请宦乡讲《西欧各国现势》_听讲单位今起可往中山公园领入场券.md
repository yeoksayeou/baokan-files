The "World Affairs Lecture Series," sponsored by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), will continue this Sunday (the 19th) at 2:00 PM in the Zhongshan Hall of Zhongshan Park, with Mr. Huan Xiang speaking on "The Current Situation in Western European Countries." Given the large number of people who requested to attend last week's lecture, starting with this lecture, any organizations, groups, or schools wishing to attend may send an official letter to the secretariat of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPPCC in the northwest corner of Zhongshan Hall in Zhongshan Park from today until 5:00 PM on Saturday to request admission tickets, limited to the actual number of people who can attend the lecture. However, the secretariat reserves the right to reduce the number of tickets issued based on the situation.
