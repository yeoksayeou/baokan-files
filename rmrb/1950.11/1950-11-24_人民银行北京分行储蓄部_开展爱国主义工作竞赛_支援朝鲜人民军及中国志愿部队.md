　　People's Bank of China Beijing Branch Savings Department
    Launches Patriotic Work Competition
    To Support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese Volunteer Army
    [Our Newspaper] In the nationwide upsurge of resisting America, aiding Korea, defending our homes, and defending our country, all working comrades of the Savings Department of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China have automatically launched current affairs studies. At an accusation meeting, everyone recounted the imperialist oppression they or their relatives and friends had suffered, and further recognized the hideous face of the imperialists. They knew that peace must be won through struggle, and happiness needs everyone to maintain it. Therefore, they displayed a high degree of patriotism. At the accusation meeting, Zhao Qizhuang, Zhao Hanzhao, Wang Zihong, and more than twenty other comrades expressed their enthusiastic willingness to join the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to fight the American devils in Korea. The female comrades also expressed their aspirations one after another. Song Shufang said: I can't shoot a gun, but I can go to the front to carry stretchers. Gao Jie said: We women have only truly been liberated today, and I will use practical actions to support our volunteer army and the Korean People's Army in resisting American imperialist aggression and protecting the fruits of victory. Zhou Yucan and Jiang Xisan, who had been beaten and insulted by American soldiers, both expressed their willingness to serve on the front lines or work doubly hard in the rear. Everyone unanimously expressed: Before being transferred, we will stick to our posts, not be afraid of difficulties, study hard, and do our job well. In this way, a work competition to develop savings business was launched enthusiastically, and red and green challenge letters were posted one after another. Field staff generally proposed to complete and strive to exceed the task of attracting deposits, and internal staff also proposed to closely cooperate with field work to ensure that deposits are cleared on the same day. Five female comrades doing internal work, in order to strengthen the economic construction forces in the rear, initiated a movement for each internal work comrade to open a household account. They said: In addition to their original work, they would use their spare time to complete this task. Many comrades said that in addition to completing the task of attracting deposits, they would do more work. Yang Shijie, a field worker, in his challenge letter to Wang Jianguang, in addition to guaranteeing to overfulfill the work task by 50%, also wrote: I will learn all the procedures in internal work within four months, strive to improve my political level, not be afraid of wind and snow for the sake of work, and can go out early and return late as needed. Chen Qi'ai, a field worker, specifically proposed in his battle letter to study the patriotic spirit of Paul Korchagin and his hard-working style. Other departments also put forward their own goals to strive for. The general affairs section automatically formulated a plan to save 4,000 jin of millet in expenses in four months.

    Because the anger at American imperialism has been transformed into the material strength to combat American imperialist aggression, the business of the Savings Department of the Beijing Branch has been further developed. In the first seven days of November, deposits increased by 7 billion yuan. In the situation of tight money supply in the market and the decline in deposit figures of some banks, it is indeed a great achievement for the Savings Department to be able to increase such a huge amount of deposits. This is the result of the active work of all working comrades in displaying their patriotic spirit. On an individual level, Yang Shijie, a field worker, alone absorbed 400 million yuan in private deposits; Song Guocheng worked while sick and absorbed 900 million yuan in deposits in thirteen days, exceeding his personal four-month task. The "one household movement" has also achieved great results: as of the 16th, five female internal affairs comrades had developed thirteen account holders, of which Han Houzhen alone developed six. The new apprentice promoted from the ranks of workers, in addition to his own work, automatically took on sweeping duties to save national expenditures; the work of each section has also been rapidly improved in the competition. The accounting section used to take two or three days to summarize the city's deposits, but now it can be summarized on the same day, which greatly helps to grasp the rise and fall of deposits in a timely manner. The general affairs section saved expenses of 1,300 jin of millet in October, exceeding the original estimate of saving 1,000 jin per month. The trust section has absorbed the accounts of two theater troupes and can receive and deposit more than one million yuan in ticket sales every day. In addition to promptly preparing and printing a large number of publicity materials to meet business needs, the planning section is preparing to dispatch a publicity vehicle, combining the propaganda of resisting America, aiding Korea, defending our homes, and defending our country, and carrying out prize-winning savings business.

    This upsurge of patriotic work competition has developed from within the department to outside the department. The business, cooperative, Xidan, Qianmenwai, Wangfujing Street and other offices have successively received their challenge letters.

　　人民银行北京分行储蓄部
    开展爱国主义工作竞赛
    支援朝鲜人民军及中国志愿部队
    【本报讯】在全国抗美援朝保家卫国的怒潮中，人民银行北京分行储蓄部的全体工作同志，自动展开时事学习，在一次控诉会上，大家追述了自己或是亲友遭受的帝国主义压迫，更认清了帝国主义者狰狞的面目。他们知道和平是要斗争来争取，幸福需要大家来维护。因此，发挥了高度的爱国主义精神。在控诉会上，赵启庄、赵汉藻、王子洪等二十几个同志，激昂地表示愿意参加中国人民援朝志愿部队，到朝鲜去打美国鬼子。女同志也纷纷的表示自己的志愿，宋淑芳说：我不会打枪，但是我可以去前方抬担架。高洁说：我们妇女今天才真正得到解放，我要用实际行动支援我们的志愿部队和朝鲜人民军，以抗击美帝的侵略，保护胜利的果实。曾遭受过美国兵殴打和辱骂的周与参、蒋锡三等，均表示愿意到前方服务或是在后方加倍努力工作。大家一致表示：在没有调动以前，坚守岗位，不怕困难，努力学习，做好工作。这样，一个开展储蓄业务的工作竞赛就热烈的展开了，红红绿绿的挑战书一张张贴出来。外勤工作人员普遍提出完成和争取超过吸收存款的任务，内勤工作人员也提出密切配合外勤工作，保证当日结清存款。五个做内部工作的女同志，为了增强后方经济建设力量，发起内勤工作同志每人开辟一户存户运动，她们表示：在原有工作之外，利用业余时间来完成这件工作。许多同志表示在完成吸收存款任务之外，还要做更多的工作。外勤杨世杰在向王建光的应战书上，除保证超额完成工作任务百分之五十外，还写着：在四个月内学会内勤工作中一切手续，努力学习提高政治水平，为了工作不怕风雪，根据需要可以早出晚归。外勤陈琦瑷在战书中，特地提出要学习保尔·柯察金爱国主义的精神和他的艰苦作风。其他部门也纷纷提出努力争取的目标。总务股自动订定了四个月节约四千斤小米经费的计划。
    由于把对美帝的愤怒变成了打击美帝侵略的物质力量，北京分行储蓄部的业务得到了进一步的开展，在十一月上旬七天中，存款增加了七十亿元。在市场银根紧迫，若干行庄存款数字下降的情况下，储蓄部能够增加巨额存款确是一件很大的成绩，这是全体工作同志发挥爱国主义精神积极工作的结果。在个人方面，外勤杨世杰独自吸收了四亿私人存款；宋国成带病工作，十三天吸收了九亿元存款，超额完成他个人四个月的任务。“一户运动”也有很大的成绩：截至十六日，五个内勤女同志发展了十三户存户，其中韩厚贞一个人发展了六户。新由工友提升的练习生除了自己的工作外，自动兼管扫除，节省国家开支；各股的工作也在竞赛中迅速得到改进。会计股以前要隔两、三天才能把全市存款汇总，现在当日可以汇总出来，对及时掌握存款升降情况帮助很大。总务股十月份节约经费合小米一千三百斤，超出了原定每月节约一千斤的预计。信托股已吸收了两个剧团户头，每天可以收存百余万的票款。计划股除了及时配合业务需要备印大量宣传品以外，筹备出动一辆宣传车，结合抗美援朝、保家卫国的宣传，开展有奖储蓄业务。
    这一爱国主义工作竞赛热潮，由部内发展到部外，营业、合作两部、西单、前门外、王府井大街等办事处，都相继接到他们的挑战书。
