　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, October 30th, TASS dispatch: The Kyodo News Agency recently reported: Deputy Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board, Masao Fukushima, said at a meeting of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee that from July to mid-August, 80,000 Japanese workers were employed by the American army to perform various tasks. Fukushima speculated that it is highly likely that Japanese experts will be needed to restore the railways in Korea.

　　The "Japan Economic News" said: Very little time is given to deliver orders for military "special needs." For example, regarding orders for automobiles, they must be delivered within one month. Regarding the delivery of railway car orders, only thirty-five to forty-five days are given. Enterprises that fail to deliver on time will be fined one percent of the total value of the order for each day of delay.

　　美国非法征用八万日本劳工
　  为美军侵略战争服务
    【新华社十月三十日讯】塔斯社东京二十八日讯：共同社最近报道：经济安定本部副长官福岛正雄曾在众院外交事务委员会会议上说：从七月到八月中旬期间，有八万日本工人为美国军队担任各种工作。据福岛揣测，极有可能需要日本专家担任恢复朝鲜铁路的工作。
    “日本经济新闻”说：只给很短的时间来交付军事方面“特殊需要”的订货。例如，关于汽车方面的订货，必须在一个月内交付。关于铁路车皮方面订货的交付，只给三十五天到四十五天的期限。未能按照定期交货的企业，每迟一天要课以订货总值的百分之一的罚金。
