Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 9th. Chen Deshun and the other ten crew members of the No. 10 fishing boat of the Yantai Aquatic Products Company, who were strafed by American aircraft on the Shandong sea on the 14th of last month, sent a telegram to Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on the 1st of this month, reporting the detailed circumstances of the incident and angrily accusing the U.S. aircraft of atrocities. The telegram reported the incident as follows: "On October 14th, we were fishing 28 nautical miles due east of Lidao. At 7:00 AM, an American aircraft with a white five-pointed star marking flew over the fishing boat at low altitude for reconnaissance and then flew northeast; at 9:00 AM, an American warship flying the American flag and bearing the number '346' on both sides of the bow sailed directly towards the fishing boat from the northeast, and circled the fishing boat for reconnaissance; at 10:00 AM, another American aircraft with a white five-pointed star marking flew over the fishing boat at low altitude for reconnaissance, and strafed the left side of the fishing boat, then turned to strafe the right side. Because our fishing boat dodged skillfully, it was not hit." The telegram continued: "We wholeheartedly support the accusations and demands you made to the United Nations on October 28th. We, the fishermen of Yantai, have been tested by the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, and we absolutely cannot tolerate the aggressive acts of American imperialism. We realize that American imperialism has replaced the Japanese invaders of the past, and it threatens the safety of our fishing at sea. We must rise up united and are willing to give everything to oppose the aggressive acts of American imperialism."

　　遭美机扫射的烟台渔船船工
    电周外长控诉美机暴行
    【新华社济南九日电】上月十四日在山东海面被美国飞机扫射的烟台水产公司十号渔船全体船工陈德顺等十一人于本月一日致电周恩来外交部长报告事件详细经过，并愤怒地控诉美机暴行。该电报告事件经过称：十月十四日我们在俚岛正东二十八海里处捕鱼。七时，有白五角星标志的美国飞机一架飞临渔船上空低飞侦察后向东北方向飞去；九时，悬有美国国旗、船前两侧有“３４６”字样的美国军舰一艘自东北方向向渔船直驶而来，并绕渔船侦察一周；十时，又有缀有白五角星标志的美国飞机飞临渔船上空低飞侦察，并向渔船左侧扫射，复转右侧扫射，因我渔船躲闪机灵，未被击中。该电继称：我们竭诚拥护您十月二十八日向联合国提出的控诉和要求。我们烟台渔民经过了抗日战争和解放战争的考验，我们绝对不能容忍美帝国主义的侵略行为。我们认识到美帝国主义已代替了当年的日寇，它威胁到我们海上捕鱼的安全。我们要一致奋起，愿付出自己的一切，反对美帝国主义的侵略行为。
