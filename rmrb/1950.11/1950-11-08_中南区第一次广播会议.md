　　The First Central South China Broadcasting Conference
    The Central South China region held its first regional broadcasting conference from October 15th to 24th, establishing the working principles of connecting with reality, connecting with the masses, and consolidating radio stations.
    In his concluding remarks at the conference, Xiong Fu, Director of the Central South China News and Publications Bureau, pointed out: "The broadcasting work in the Central South China region has made great achievements in the past year, training a large number of radio personnel, and establishing radio stations in counties and regiments. Factories, institutions, and schools in cities all have radios and amplifiers, enabling the Party and the People's Government's various policies and decrees to be quickly and widely transmitted to the masses." He pointed out that "connecting with reality and connecting with the masses are important keys to improving work. Broadcasting work must closely cooperate with the current central work, vividly and powerfully reflect the lives and struggles of the masses, and raise the awareness of the masses, guiding the thoughts and actions of the broad masses to the political direction of national construction, so that our radio stations become a scientific tool for the self-education of workers, peasants, and soldiers, a forum for the masses, and a political center for mass activities, attracting activists among the masses to participate in broadcasting work and enriching the content of our broadcasting programs. We must adopt a series of measures to organize correspondents and listening groups, and deepen our interview work into the masses, becoming the eyes and ears of the people. Every colleague must have a serious and responsible spirit towards work, pay attention to studying policies and the characteristics of broadcasting work, and adopt various forms of propaganda to adapt to various audiences, overcoming blindness in work."
    Regarding the consolidation of radio stations, Comrade Xiong Fu pointed out: "We must vigorously train radio operators, strengthen business guidance for radio operators, and educate them to be good at winning the attention and help of leaders, so that radio stations meet the needs of current work. We can cultivate model radio stations in remote areas and key areas of mass movements, seeking consolidation in development, and seeking further development in consolidation."
