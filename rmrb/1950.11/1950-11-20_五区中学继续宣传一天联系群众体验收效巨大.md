　　[Our Newspaper Despatch] The middle schools in the Fifth District of Beijing continued their propaganda outreach on the 19th. Over 4,400 people from eleven units, including the Fourth Middle School, the Eighth Middle School, the Sixth Middle School, the Girls' First Middle School, Shandong Middle School, and New England Middle School participated. The propaganda included shows most liked by the masses, such as peep shows, clapper talks, crosstalk (dialogue), and living newspaper plays. Each performance was warmly welcomed by the masses. The performances connected with the things the masses experienced firsthand, resulting in even greater impact. Guan Rongqi, a rickshaw puller from Xiaopen Hutong, saw the New England Middle School's play depicting how American reactionaries slaughtered the people, reminding him that he had pulled a rickshaw for twenty years of his forty-seven years without ever having enough to eat. Today, after liberation, his life has improved, and he can eat his fill. He said, "Heaven above, earth below, we must have a conscience and defend our homes and our country. Everyone should do their part. We must all be of one mind to defeat the American aggressors, or we will not have a good life!" An old woman in her forties was so moved that she led the masses in shouting slogans. After the students used crosstalk to analyze the difference between the Korean people and the "Goryeo sticks," a Korean audience member named Li Dongzhen was very moved. He said, "I hope you can expand this kind of propaganda among the broad masses." When the Fourth Middle School performed the play "Attack Korea," a soldier was moved to tears. He said, "I must bring this emotion to the troops!" He also asked to learn the anti-American and aid-Korea songs from the students so he could teach them to his comrades.

　　The students' enthusiasm was consistently high. After propagandizing for a day, the students of the Fourth Middle School, their voices hoarse from shouting, still sang songs and returned to school in very orderly ranks.

　　五区中学继续宣传一天联系群众体验收效巨大
    【本报讯】京市第五区各中学校于十九日继续出动宣传一天。出动的有四中、八中、六中、女一中、山东、新英等十一个单位，共四千四百余人。这次宣传包括有群众所最喜欢的拉洋片、快板、相声（对话）、活报剧等。每次演出都受到群众热烈的欢迎。演出联系到群众亲身体验到的东西，效果更大。小盆胡同三轮工人关荣起看到新英中学剧里表演美国反动派怎样屠害人民，想起他四十七岁，有二十年拉三轮，没吃过饱饭。解放后的今天，他的生活改善了，能吃饱了。他说：“上有天，下有地，我们要有良心，保家卫国，人人都应当。我们大伙要一个心，打垮美国侵略军，不然就不能有好生活！”一位四十多岁的老太太被感动得领着群众喊口号。当同学们用相声的方法来分析了朝鲜人民与“高丽棒子”不同后，旁边有一个朝鲜观众李东真非常受感动。他说：“希望你们能在广大群众中扩大这种宣传。”当第四中学演《打到朝鲜去》一剧时，一个战士被感动得哭了。他说：“我一定要把这种情绪带到部队里去！”他并要求向同学学抗美援朝的歌子，好教给部队同志唱。
    同学们的情绪始终是很高的。第四中学同学们宣传了一天，嗓子都喊哑了，还唱着歌子，排着很整齐的队伍回到学校去。
