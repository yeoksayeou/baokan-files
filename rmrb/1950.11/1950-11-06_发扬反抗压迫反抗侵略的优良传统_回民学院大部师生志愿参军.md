Promoting the Fine Tradition of Resisting Oppression and Aggression
Majority of Teachers and Students at the National Minorities Institute Voluntarily Enlist

[Our Newspaper] The entire faculty, staff, and students of the National Minorities Institute have been swept up in the upsurge of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country. After several discussions, the majority of teachers and students have volunteered to join the army to crush the aggressive schemes of American imperialism. Many students have sworn oaths to express their iron will. For example, the oath of all the students in the second year of senior high school reads: "I volunteer to join the army to resist American imperialist aggression, support the Korean people's war of liberation, defend our motherland, and defend our hometown. We will beat the American imperialists until they are battered and bleeding, and make them follow the same path of failure as the Japanese devils! In order to protect our homes and defend our country and liberate the oppressed people, we will not hesitate to shed blood and sacrifice, and we are not afraid of any difficulties. We will carry forward the glorious tradition of the Chinese people against imperialism, and strive for the complete liberation of all mankind! We hereby swear this oath."

Teachers Hold Symposium on Resisting America and Aiding Korea
Resolved to Fight American Imperialism to the End

On the afternoon of the third, the trade union held a symposium on resisting America and aiding Korea. Teachers spoke one after another, not only criticizing their past erroneous views, but also unanimously believing that we Hui people have never succumbed to the oppression of the reactionaries. Now that American imperialism dares to disrupt our happy life after liberation, we are determined to fight it to the end. One old teacher said, "Although I am older, my enthusiasm is not less than that of young people. I can't fight, but I can carry stretchers." Another said, "I am not willing to admit that I am old. As long as there is a breath left, I swear to shed the last drop of blood for the motherland, and I will never let our children be slaves of American imperialism!" During the symposium, student representatives from various classes challenged the teachers and read out their oaths to join the army, making the atmosphere at the meeting even more tense and enthusiastic. Finally, two proposals were adopted by the whole body: 1. Write to Chairman Mao to express the determination to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country; 2. In order to further promote the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, it is suggested that the school establish a permanent body.

Institute Holds Anti-American Indictment Meeting
Swears Oath to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Homes, and Defend Country

Amidst feelings of sorrow, indignation, and excitement, the institute held a meeting on the morning of the fourth, where all the staff, students, and employees condemned American imperialism. In the center of the meeting place hung a portrait of Chairman Mao and a peace dove. All around were posted slogans for resisting America and aiding Korea, large maps, and cartoons. The oaths and signature lists of students voluntarily enlisting in the army were also posted, fully demonstrating a combat stance of taking practical action against American imperialism. After the meeting began, someone first read in a heavy tone the news published that day that American imperialism was conspiring to deny the Yalu River as the border between China and Korea. Everyone present expressed extreme indignation upon hearing this. Comrade Wan Yaobin, the chairman, said in his opening remarks, "Today, the American imperialist war of aggression is to follow the old path of Japanese imperialism. We should recall the pain that Japanese imperialism inflicted on us in the past. Our people and our country have grown in struggle. Now that we have stood up, we will never allow any imperialism to invade again. In particular, our Hui youth have a fine tradition of opposing oppressors and aggressors. We should carry forward our traditional spirit and strive to crush the aggressive schemes of American imperialism!" More than a dozen people spoke in succession to condemn the atrocities of American imperialism. Many more wanted to speak, but were unable to due to time constraints. A flame of anger from both new and old hatred burned in everyone's heart. Someone shouted the slogan "Blood debt must be repaid with blood," which immediately resonated throughout the meeting. Comrade Wang Shuguang said, "We Hui people have suffered even more severely from the poisoning of imperialism and its running dogs, but we have never succumbed. Today, we must unite together to drive American imperialism out of Asia!" Finally, an oath was taken to resist America and aid Korea. Everyone present firmly raised their right hands and solemnly read the oath: "I swear to take practical action to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country, and to be prepared to join the army and participate in the war at any time, and to spare no sacrifice, dedicating all my strength..."

　　发扬反抗压迫反抗侵略的优良传统
    回民学院大部师生志愿参军
    【本报讯】国立回民学院全体师生员工已卷入抗美援朝保家卫国的高潮。经过数次讨论，大部师生都志愿参军，粉碎美帝侵略阴谋。很多同学都宣誓表示了他们的钢铁意志。如高二全体同学的誓词说：我志愿参军，抵抗美帝的侵略，支援朝鲜人民解放战争，保卫我们的祖国，保卫我们的家乡。我们要打得美帝头破血流，让他走上日本鬼子同样失败的道路！为了保家卫国和解放被压迫的人民，我们不惜流血和牺牲，不怕任何困难，发扬中国人民反帝的光荣传统，为争取全人类彻底的解放而奋斗！谨此宣誓。
    教师座谈抗美援朝
    决与美帝周旋到底
    三日下午工会举行了抗美援朝座谈会。各教师纷纷发言，除各自批评了以前的错误观点外，一致认为：我们回民从未在反动派压迫下屈服过，如今美帝胆敢破坏我们翻身后的幸福生活，我们决和它周旋到底。一位老教师说：“我虽然年纪大些，热情并不减于青年。我不会打仗，抬担架是可以的。”另一位说：“我是不服老的，只要一息尚存，誓为祖国流尽最后一滴血，决不让我们的儿女做美帝的奴隶！”在座谈进行中间，各班同学代表纷向老师挑战，宣读他们参军的誓词；使得会场益形紧张热烈。最后全体通过提案两件：一、上书毛主席，表示抗美援朝保家卫国的决心；二、为进一步推动反美援朝工作，建议学校成立常设机构。
    全院举行抗美控诉大会
    宣誓抗美援朝保家卫国
    在悲愤激昂的情绪中，该学院四日上午举行了全院员工生抗美控诉大会。会场正中高悬毛主席像及和平鸽，四周贴满抗美援朝的标语及大幅地图和漫画。各班同学志愿参军誓词及签名单也张贴出来，充分表现了一种对美帝采取实际行动的战斗姿态。开会后，首先有人以沉痛的语调朗诵了当天报载美帝阴谋否认鸭绿江为中朝边境的新闻。与会的人们，听闻之下，无不表示极端愤慨。主席宛耀宾同学致开会词时说：“今天美帝的侵略战争，就是要走日本帝国主义的老路。我们应当回忆一下过去日本帝国主义所给予我们的创痛。我们的人民和祖国是在斗争中成长的。在我们已经站了起来的今天，是决不容许任何帝国主义再来侵略的。尤其我们回族青年具有反对压迫者、侵略者的优良传统，我们应当发扬我们的传统精神，为粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋而奋斗！”上台控诉美帝暴行的连续有十几个人。还有很多人要求控诉，因时间关系未能上台。一种新仇旧恨的愤怒火焰燃烧在每个人的心中。会场上有人喊出“血债血还”的口号，立刻得到了全场的共鸣。王曙光同学说：“我们回族人民所遭受帝国主义及其走狗的毒害，更为惨重，但我们从未屈服过。今天我们一定团结在一起，共同把美帝撵出亚洲去！”最后举行抗美援朝的宣誓。与会的人们都坚决地举直了右手，庄严地宣读了“我宣誓以实际行动抗美援朝，保家卫国，准备随时参军参战，不惜任何牺牲，献出自己的一切力量。……”的誓词。
