"New Times" Weekly Short Commentary
Bloodthirsty and Shameless Clamor
American imperialists are not satisfied with the invasion of Korea; they are plotting further bloody atrocities. The newspapers of the monopoly capitalists have recently revealed some information about the sinister plans brewing in the Pentagon (the address of the U.S. Department of Defense) and the State Department.

Hobart, the Associated Press correspondent in Tokyo, has learned that the warmongers in Washington are attempting to utilize the infamous Chiang Kai-shek clique and the defeated Japanese militarists in their invasion plans. The American plan to expand its aggression in the Far East is to have the American air force bomb peaceful cities of the People's Republic of China while Chiang Kai-shek launches an offensive in South China. Hobart asserts that the American invaders are only waiting for an opportunity to mobilize Japanese armed forces and utilize Japanese manpower and "the experience Japan gained in its war of aggression against China."

These shameless threats against the great Chinese people demonstrate that the bloodthirsty American imperialists are eager to expand the scope of their atrocities and are prepared to launch any provocation to achieve their aims. American and British propaganda is spreading all sorts of absurd rumors about China, slandering the Chinese people and their leaders, in order to facilitate the new acts of aggression planned by the imperialists.

The fact that the American and British blocs are refusing the People's Republic of China admission to the United Nations is closely related to the aforementioned aggression plans. All those who oppose the recognition of the legitimate representative seat of the People's Republic of China in the Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly are, whether willingly or unwillingly, participating in the imperialists' sinister plans against the five hundred million Chinese people.

If the strategists in Washington believe that they can recklessly expand the war of aggression in Korea to China, this illusion, needless to say, is doomed to failure. Zhou Enlai, the Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China, recently stated: "The Chinese people love peace, but in order to defend peace, they have never been and will never be afraid of resisting wars of aggression."

　　《新时代》周刊短评
    嗜血的无耻叫嚣
    美帝国主义者并不以侵略朝鲜为已足，它正在策划进一步的血腥暴行。独占资本家的报纸最近把五角大厦（美国国防部地址）和国务院中正在酝酿着罪恶计划的消息透露出一些来。
    美联社驻东京记者霍布莱特探悉：华盛顿的战争贩子们企图在侵略计划中利用声名狼藉的蒋介石集团和被击垮的日本军国主义者。美国扩大远东侵略的计划就是：一面美国空军轰炸中华人民共和国的和平城市，一面蒋介石将在华南发动攻势。霍布莱特这样地断言着，从他所说的话看来，美国侵略者只正在等待着时机来动员日本的武装部队，并利用日本的人力和“日本在侵华战争中所取得的经验”。
    这些对伟大中国人民的无耻威胁显示着：嗜血的美帝国主义者急于扩大暴行的范围，准备发动任何挑衅以求进行他们的意图。美国和英国的宣传正在散播各种各样关于中国的荒谬谣言，诽谤中国人民和他们的领袖，为的是便利帝国主义者所策划的新的侵略行为。
    美英集团拒绝中华人民共和国进联合国，这一事实是与上述的侵略计划密切联系着的。凡是反对认可中华人民共和国在安理会及联合国大会的合法代表席的人们，不论他是甘心或不甘心，都是参与帝国主义者的罪恶计划来反对五亿中国人民的。
    如果华盛顿的战略家们认为他们可以不顾一切地把在朝鲜进行的侵略战争扩大到中国，这一种幻想，不消说，是注定要破灭的。中华人民共和国外长周恩来最近说道：“中国人民热爱和平，但是为了保卫和平，从不也永不害怕反抗侵略战争。”
