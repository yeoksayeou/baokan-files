　　"The Six-Nation Proposal" and "The Seven-Nation Proposal"
     ——Answering Readers' Questions
    (Question) In Vishinsky's speech at the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on October 28th, what exactly is the nature of the "Six-Nation Proposal" and the "Seven-Nation Proposal" to which the Soviet Union planned to submit several amendments on October 30th? Please explain.
    Reader Wang Ruoqi
    (Answer) The US-British bloc, using its "voting machine" in the First Committee (i.e., the Political and Security Committee) of the United Nations General Assembly, rejected the Soviet Union's proposal for a "Declaration on the Elimination of the Threat of a New War and the Strengthening of Peace and Security," and is preparing to submit the so-called "Seven-Nation Proposal" for a vote. This hypocritical move is inseparable from the US-British bloc's entire sinister plan to prepare for a new war under the guise of peace.

    The Soviet Union's peace proposal called for the General Assembly to condemn war propaganda; unconditionally prohibit atomic weapons, establish strict international control, and declare that the government that first uses atomic weapons or other weapons of mass extermination of people is guilty of a crime against humanity; the five great powers conclude a treaty to consolidate peace; and the five permanent members of the Security Council reduce their armed forces by one-third. It is quite obvious that the purpose of the Soviet proposal is to maintain world peace, eliminate the threat of a new war, and ensure the security of all countries. Therefore, this proposal has been unanimously supported by peace-loving people around the world. However, the US-British bloc believes that the Soviet Union's peace proposal obstructs their path to preparing for a new war, so they brazenly rejected it. At the same time, they are afraid of world public opinion, so, according to their tricks, they put forward a hypocritical proposal that seems to strive for peace but is actually the opposite, to replace the Soviet Union's proposal, just as the Dutch representative admitted, they attempt to eliminate "the impression that only the Soviet Union loves peace."

    Such were the motives and nature of the so-called "Peace Through Action" proposal put forward by the six countries, the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Lebanon, and Mexico, when the UN Political Committee began to consider the Soviet Union's peace proposal. Bolivia, one of the vassals of the United States, also put forward a similar proposal, but later withdrew its proposal and joined the six-nation proposal as one of the joint proposing countries. Thus, the so-called "Six-Nation Proposal" became the "Seven-Nation Proposal."

    The full text of the so-called "Seven-Nation Proposal" has not yet been published, but it can be known from the speeches of Vishinsky and Malik that this proposal also advocates "condemning aggression," but does not include condemning various forms of interference in internal wars. The proposal does not mention the issue of banning atomic weapons and implementing effective control at all, not even with words "appeal," "demand," "declare," or "suggest" by the General Assembly, only saying that "every country must undertake the obligation to establish effective international control in order to effectively implement the prohibition of atomic weapons." The proposal does not mention maintaining world peace by concluding a five-power treaty, but advocates stipulating that countries should "take joint action to stop aggression." This proposition is actually to pave the way for the imperialist group's collective plan for aggressive war. Therefore, the seven-nation proposal violates the purposes of the United Nations and the will of the people of the world.

    However, the Soviet Union, which wholeheartedly strives for world peace, still does not give up its efforts to strive for peace after the peace declaration proposal it put forward was rejected by the US-British bloc's voting machine, and expressed its willingness to suggest amending the so-called "Seven-Nation Proposal" so that it can play a role in maintaining world peace to some extent. The Soviet government's consistent policy of striving to defend world peace at all times and everywhere has provided indelible evidence in this event.

　　“六国提案”与“七国提案”
     ——答读者问
    （问）维辛斯基于十月二十八日在联合国大会第一委员会上的演说中间所提到“六国提案”与十月三十日苏联拟提出若干修正案的“七国提案”究竟具有怎样的性质，请加以解释。
    读者王若其
    （答）美英集团利用其“表决机器”在联合国大会第一委员会（即政治与安全委员会）中否决了苏联所提出的关于“制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全的宣言”的议案，并准备把所谓“七国提案”提付表决。这种虚伪的动态是和美英集团企图在和平烟幕下准备新战争的整个罪恶计划分不开的。
    苏联的和平提案要求大会谴责新战争宣传；无条件禁止原子武器，建立严格的国际管制，并宣布首先使用原子武器或其他大规模杀害人民的武器的政府犯有屠杀人类的罪行；五强缔结巩固和平公约；安理会中五常任理事国把武装部队裁减三分之一。十分明显：苏联提案的目的是在于维护世界和平、清除新战争威胁及保证各国安全，因此这一建议是得到世界爱好和平的人民的一致拥护的。但是美英集团认为苏联的和平提案阻碍了他们准备新战争的道路，便悍然予以拒绝，同时它又害怕世界的舆论，于是按照他们的愤技，提出一项貌似争取和平而实质却正相反的虚伪提案来顶替苏联的提案，正如荷兰代表所招认，他们企图消除“唯独有苏联爱好和平的印象”。
    当联大政委会开始审议苏联的和平提案的时候，美、英、法、荷、黎巴嫩、墨西哥六国所提出的所谓“和平须赖行动”的提案的动机和性质就是如此。美国的附庸国之一玻利维亚也曾提出了一项性质类似的提案，后来把自己的提案收回了，而参加六国提案，作为共同提案国之一。这样，所谓“六国提案”变成“七国提案”了。
    所谓“七国提案”的全文尚未发表，但从维辛斯基和马立克的演说中可以知道：这一提案也主张“谴责侵略”，但却不包括谴责各种形式的对内战的干涉。提案对于禁止原子武器和实行有效管制的问题完全不提，甚至连由大会“呼吁”“要求”“宣告”或“建议”的字眼都没有，只说“每一个国家都必须承担建立有效的国际管制的义务，以便有效地实行禁止原子武器”。提案中并不提到以缔结五强公约的方式来维护世界和平，而主张规定各国要“联合行动以制止侵略”，这一主张在实际上是要为帝国主义集团集体进行侵略战争计划开辟道路。因此七国提案是违背联合国的宗旨与世界人民的意志的。
    然而全心全意争取世界和平的苏联，当她所提出的和平宣言提案被美英集团的表决机器否决后，仍然不放弃争取和平的努力，表示愿意建议把所谓“七国提案”予以修正，使它对于维护世界和平多少能起一些作用。苏联政府随时随地尽力于保卫世界和平的始终不渝的政策，在这事件上又提供了不可磨灭的明证。
