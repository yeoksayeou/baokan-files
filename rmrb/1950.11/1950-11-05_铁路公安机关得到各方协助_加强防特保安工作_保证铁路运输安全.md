Xinhua News Agency, 4th: With the assistance of the broad masses of workers and staff, and with the cooperation of local people's governments, local public security organs, and military regions along the routes, railway public security organs throughout the country have made remarkable achievements in suppressing counter-revolutionary sabotage activities over the past year. Railway bureaus in the Northeast, North, and South have successively carried out registration work for reactionary party, league, and secret agent elements, destroyed the original special agent organizations of the Kuomintang bandit gangs, cracked down on the lurking activities of counter-revolutionary elements, prevented various sabotage accidents, and ensured the safety of railway transportation. According to statistics from the six railway public security offices within the customs from January to July this year, 116 espionage cases were cracked, and 238 bandits were captured. The more significant cases included the destruction of the lurking organizations and activities of the bandit "Defense Department 11th Pacification District Lu Guerrilla Detachment Headquarters," "Army Infantry Advance Army," "Bureau of Confidentiality Railway Security Group Jianghuai Investigation Detachment," and the "Military Intelligence Agent Shi Qi case." Two hundred and eighty cases of sabotage of railway equipment and communication equipment were cracked, and a total of 741 armed agents and thieves and saboteurs were captured, and light machine guns, submachine guns, Thomson guns, and 48 long and short guns were seized.

These special agents took advantage of loopholes such as the lack of strictness in the system of some of our railway organs and the ideological paralysis of working cadres to infiltrate our railway employees or railway public security personnel to carry out sabotage activities. For example, Jia Chunmao, the "political commissar" of the bandit "Defense Department 11th Pacification District Lu Guerrilla Detachment," and Shi Chunxi, the "deputy commander and director of the political department," infiltrated the Qiugu Public Security Police Station of Zhangdian Station of the Jinan Railway Bureau and the Alert Section of the Qingdao Public Security Branch, respectively, and stole documents such as the statistical figures of our Qingdao-Jinan line's alert armed guns and ammunition. Shi Qi, a special agent of the "Military Intelligence," infiltrated the public security team of the Qishuyan Machine Factory on the Beijing-Shanghai line, developed a special agent organization, secretly drew the terrain of the machine factory and station, and carried out sabotage. After the lurking activities of these special agents were discovered by our railway public security organs, they were promptly captured and severely punished.

Since US imperialism openly launched armed aggression against Korea and Taiwan, the public security organs of our railways on all lines are cooperating with the broad masses of workers and staff to further enhance vigilance, strengthen anti-espionage work, resolutely suppress the sabotage activities of counter-revolutionary elements, and safeguard the people's railways and the safety of the people's lives and property.

　　铁路公安机关得到各方协助
    加强防特保安工作  保证铁路运输安全
    【新华社四日讯】全国铁路公安机关结合广大职工群众，在沿线各级人民政府、地方公安机关和军区部队的协助下，一年多来在镇压反革命分子破坏活动的工作上，取得了显著成绩。东北、北方和南方各路局都先后进行了反动党、团特务分子登记工作，摧毁了国民党匪帮原有的特务组织，打击了反革命分子的潜伏活动，防止了各种破坏事故，保证了铁路运输的安全。据关内六个铁路公安处今年一月到七月现有材料的统计：破获了特务案件一百一十六件，捕获了匪犯二百三十八名，其中较重大的，计有匪“国防部十一绥区鲁游击支队司令总部”、“陆军步兵挺进军”、“保密局铁路保防小组江淮调查中队”、“军统特务施奇案”等潜伏组织和活动；破获了破坏铁路器材和通讯器材案二百八十件，捕获武装特务及偷盗破坏分子共七百四十一人，缴获轻机枪、冲锋枪、汤姆式枪各一挺和长短枪四十八枝。
    这些特务分子，利用我部分铁路机关制度不够严密、工作干部思想麻痹等空隙，混入我铁路员工或铁路公安人员中，进行破坏活动。如匪“国防部十一绥区鲁游击支队”的“政治委员”贾春茂和“副司令兼政治部主任”史纯熙，分别混入了我济南路局张店站秋谷公安派出所和青岛公安分处警备科任职，窃取我青济沿线警备武装枪弹统计数字等文件；匪“军统”特务分子施奇，混入京沪线戚墅堰机厂公安队工作，发展特务组织，偷绘机厂、车站地形，进行破坏。这些特务分子的潜伏活动，经我铁路公安机关发现后，及时予以捕获并严予惩处。
    自美帝国主义公开武装侵略朝鲜、台湾以来，我各线铁路公安机关正配合广大职工群众进一步提高警惕，加强防特工作，坚决镇压反革命分子的破坏活动，保卫人民铁道和人民生命财产的安全。
