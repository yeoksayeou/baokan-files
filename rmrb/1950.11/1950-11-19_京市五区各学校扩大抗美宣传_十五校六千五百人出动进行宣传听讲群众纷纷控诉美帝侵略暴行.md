　　Schools in Five Districts of Beijing Expand Anti-American Propaganda
    Fifteen Schools Send Out 6,500 People to Conduct Propaganda; Listening Masses Accuse American Imperialism of Aggressive Atrocities

    [Reported by this newspaper] In order to promote the Resist America, Aid Korea movement more widely and deeply, major middle schools in Beijing's Fifth District simultaneously launched street propaganda activities from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM on the 18th. Fifteen units, including Peking University, No. 4 Middle School, No. 6 Middle School, No. 8 Middle School, Girls' No. 1 Middle School, Shandong Middle School, New England Middle School, and Industrial School, participated, totaling more than 6,500 people. They were divided into fifty-five propaganda teams and appropriately divided the propaganda areas. Through living newspaper plays, cross-talk, clapper talk, shadow plays, explaining cartoons, and speeches, they explained the crimes of American imperialism in invading China, so that the masses realized that if we want to live a good life and defend our country, we must resist American imperialism and aid the Korean people.

    Before going to the streets to conduct propaganda, the students of various schools first conducted current affairs studies themselves and enthusiastically researched and discussed current affairs issues. Some schools also held accusation meetings and report meetings. The students generally had a further understanding of current affairs and clarified their thinking. Before setting out, some schools further understood the ideological problems existing among the citizens and the propaganda forms they liked most; then they incorporated the answers into their favorite entertainment programs and performed them for them. As a result, the effect was very good.

    New England Middle School used a method of closely coordinating drama and recitation in Zhongshan Park. They performed "A Patriotic Mother," which depicted how the American-Li bandit troops cruelly harmed the people, followed by a recitation of "How My Daughter Was Deceived." Everyone was very moved. Many students and audience members were moved to tears. An old worker ran to the stage in tears and said, "Whenever I think of imperialism, I feel sad. I have experienced the crimes of American and Japanese devils. I used to pull a rickshaw, and they beat me beyond recognition!" He shouted to the students, "We can't let those devilish bastards come again!" Then an elementary school teacher also ran to the front to accuse: The Japanese devils once tied up his brother and his uncle, stripped them naked, poured boiling water on them, and灌凉水. He said, "I will not cry, I will study hard and serve the people, and turn grief into strength!" Then the citizen Zheng Jinghai, who accused, only said one sentence, "I have suffered too much!" and could not continue. The shouts of "Defeat the American aggressors!" from the citizens and students resounded as one.

    When Guanghua Girls' Middle School used cartoons to explain how American imperialism trampled on the people, an old lady said angrily, "I wish I could scrape its flesh, marinate its meat, and only then would I be relieved of my hatred." Some elementary school students were so angry that they actually stepped forward to beat the American soldiers. Everyone clapped their hands and said, "That's right!" An old lady Zhang said, "When I was eight years old, the American devils came. The Eight-Power Allied Forces burned, killed, and looted everywhere. During Chiang Kai-shek's time, no one ever cared about accidental deaths. We were not competitive in the past, but this year is different from previous years! We must beat it and never let it come again!"

    The students were in high spirits and prepared to continue propaganda to the citizens for one day on Sunday the 19th.

　　京市五区各学校扩大抗美宣传
    十五校六千五百人出动进行宣传听讲群众纷纷控诉美帝侵略暴行
    【本报讯】京市第五区各大中学校，为了更普遍深入的宣传抗美援朝运动，十八日从上午十时到下午五时，一齐出动作了街头宣传。出动的计有北大、四中、六中、八中、女一中、山东、新英、工业学校等十五个单位，共六千五百余人。分成五十五个宣传队，并适当地划分了宣传地区。通过活报剧、相声、快板、拉洋片、讲解漫画、演讲等方式，说明美帝的侵华罪行，使群众认识到：我们要想过好日子，保卫自己的国家，就必须抗击美帝侵略，援助朝鲜人民。
    各学校的同学们，在未出动到街头宣传之前，首先自己进行了时事学习，热烈地研究讨论了时事问题。有的学校并开了控诉会及报告会。同学们普遍地对时事有了进一步的认识，明确了自己的思想。有些学校在出动前，更了解了市民中所存在的思想问题及他们所最喜欢的宣传形式；然后将解答编在他们最喜欢的文娱节目里，表演给他们看。结果效果很好。
    新英中学在中山公园采用了演剧与朗诵紧紧配合的方法。表演“爱国的母亲”，内容是描写美李匪军怎样残害人民，接着朗诵“我的女儿是怎样受骗的”，大家非常感动。同学和观众很多人都被感动得哭了。一位老工人流着眼泪跑到台前说：“提起帝国主义，我就伤心。美国、日本鬼子的罪，我都学过。从前我拉三轮，叫他们打的不象个样子！”他对同学喊着说“可再不能让那鬼子王八蛋来呀！”接着有一个小学教师也跑到前面来控诉：日本鬼子曾把他哥哥和他伯父一块捆走了，脱光了身子，用开水浇，还灌凉水。他说：“我不哭，我要好好学习，为人民服务，把悲愤变为力量！”接着控诉的市民郑静海只说了一句“我的苦太多了！”就说不下去了。市民和同学们“打垮美国侵略军！”的喊声响成一片。
    光华女中用漫画讲解美帝怎样遭踏人民的时候，一位老太太愤恨地说：“恨不得把它的肉刮了，腌它的肉，才解恨。”有的小学生气得真个的上前打美国兵。大家拍手说：“打的对！”一位张老太太说：“我八岁的时候，美国鬼子就来啦。八国联军到处烧杀抢夺。蒋介石的时候，碰死人从来就没人管过。过去不争气，今年可不同往年了！我们一定要打它，不再叫它来！”
    同学们情绪很高，准备十九日利用星期日继续向市民宣传一天。
