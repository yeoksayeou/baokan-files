Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 24th (TASS dispatch): The UN Political Committee continued its discussion of the Kuomintang's libel case at its morning session on November 23rd. The first speaker, the Uruguayan representative, stated that if the proposal put forward by the Kuomintang elements was rejected, the Uruguayan delegation would vote in favor of the Syrian proposal.

Soviet representative Malik then delivered a lengthy speech. At the beginning of his speech, Malik pointed out that two viewpoints had emerged in the Political Committee during the discussion of the Kuomintang's false accusation case. The majority of delegations believed that the issue belonged to the past and was not worth spending time on. On the other hand, the US delegation and the representatives of the Kuomintang clique were trying to salvage the Kuomintang's libel case to avoid complete failure, in order to escape the predicament faced by the Kuomintang slanderers and their American masters.

Malik urged the Political Committee to pay attention to the fact that the US delegation was making every effort to keep the Kuomintang's libel case on the agenda of the General Assembly. This had been proven by the actions of the US delegation, who were frantically seeking any suggestion that could delay the removal of this issue from the agenda of the General Assembly. Malik urged the Political Committee to pay attention to the change in the attitude of the Syrian delegation towards the Kuomintang's false accusation case. At the first meeting, the Syrian representative had quite successfully exposed the suggestion of establishing an "investigation group" to further study and investigate the Kuomintang's false accusation case as being completely absurd and ridiculous. However, at a later meeting, the Syrian representative reversed his previous attitude and suggested that the Kuomintang's false accusation case be sent back to the Interim Committee for further study.

Malik criticized the suggestion of the Salvadoran delegation, which urged UN member states to faithfully fulfill the recommendations contained in the resolution passed by the General Assembly at its meeting last year. Malik recounted that this resolution was forced through the Fourth UN General Assembly under the pressure of the US-British bloc shortly after the US ruling clique's policy failed in China. He also recounted that the recommendations contained in this resolution were that China and the Chinese people should continue to fulfill the various enslaving clauses of treaties that US monopoly enterprises had forced China to accept during the Kuomintang's rule. Malik said that this illegal discriminatory resolution against China was forced through the General Assembly by the US-British bloc in order to maintain their rule in China.

Malik emphasized the historical significance of the Chinese people's victory in their struggle against the combined forces of domestic reactionaries and international imperialism, saying: Now is the final moment, and the imperialists and their agents must understand that all such suggestions and proposals as the Salvadoran proposal are no longer relevant to the current situation, but are outdated and obsolete concepts. Malik said that such suggestions are an insult to the Chinese people, because the Chinese people have become masters of their own destiny, and no one can interfere with them, and the Chinese people will defend their own cause. Malik said: Considering the discriminatory and insulting nature of the Salvadoran proposal regarding the great Chinese people, the Soviet delegation opposes this proposal and will vote against it, because it is hostile to the Chinese people and is insulting to the Chinese people.

In the concluding part of his speech, Malik attacked the attitude taken by the US delegation towards the Kuomintang's false accusation. Malik reminded the Political Committee of the following facts: After the US ruling clique forced through the resolution mentioned in the Salvadoran representative's suggestion at the Fourth UN General Assembly, they had crudely and shamelessly violated all the recommendations in this resolution during the period between the Fourth and Fifth UN General Assemblies. They occupied the island of Taiwan, established a puppet regime under their control there, and gave the regime military and economic assistance, thereby interfering in China's internal affairs. Malik said: The American imperialists slandered the Soviet Union in an attempt to cover up their aggression plans and aggression actions against the Chinese people.

After Malik's speech, Chiang Ting-fu, the representative of the Kuomintang clique, spoke next, and he had to admit that his proposal had completely failed. He withdrew his proposal and supported the Syrian proposal.

New Zealand representative Berendsen, who served as a mouthpiece for the US delegation at this session of the General Assembly, delivered an impolite speech, accusing the majority in the Political Committee of preparing to "wash their hands" of the issue under discussion. Berendsen pounded the table and urged the majority to "reconsider" the consequences of this attitude.

The New Zealand representative requested the Political Committee to pass the Syrian proposal, saying: The General Assembly should at least give the Kuomintang regime "moral support."

The Salvadoran representative then spoke, declaring regarding the Kuomintang's withdrawal of its proposal: his delegation proposed the amendment to the Kuomintang proposal as another proposal. The Salvadoran proposal requested that UN member states note "the need to faithfully fulfill" the recommendations contained in the resolution of the Fourth UN General Assembly.

After the British representative spoke, the discussion ended, and the Political Committee proceeded to vote.

First, the Syrian proposal, which stipulated that the Kuomintang's false accusation case be returned to the Interim Committee, was voted on. The proposal passed with a majority of thirty-five votes (the United States, New Zealand, the Latin American countries, and most of the Arab countries) against seventeen votes (the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the United Kingdom, India, Australia, Canada, etc.). Seven abstentions (the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.).

Then, the Salvadoran proposal was voted on, and the result was that the proposal passed with thirty-eight votes in favor (the United States, the United Kingdom, France, etc.), and six votes against (the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia). Fourteen abstentions (India, Indonesia, Pakistan, etc.). The discussion on the Kuomintang's false accusation case ended here, and the Political Committee adjourned.

The Political Committee will begin discussing the issue of US aggression against China on November 24th, which was included on the agenda of the General Assembly at the suggestion of the Soviet delegation.

　　联大政委会结束讨论“控苏案”
    马立克抨击美国干涉中国内政
    揭露美帝诽谤苏联、企图掩盖侵略行动的阴谋
    政委会决议将诬告案仍交回非法的临时委员会
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约二十四日电：联大政治委员会十一月二十三日上午会议继续讨论国民党的诽谤案。第一个发言的乌拉圭代表说：如果国民党分子所提出的提案遭到否决，乌拉圭代表团将投票赞成叙利亚的提案。
    苏联代表马立克随后发表长篇演说。马立克在其演说一开始时便指出：在讨论国民党的诬告案时，政治委员会中形成了两种观点。多数代表团都认为这个问题已属过去，不值得花费时间讨论。另一方面，美国代表团以及国民党集团的代表却力图挽救国民党诽谤案使它免遭完全失败，以求逃避国民党诽谤分子及其美国主子们所处的窘境。
    马立克促请政治委员会注意。美国代表团竭力设法把国民党的诽谤案保持在大会议程上。这已由美国代表团的行为所证明，他们狂乱地寻求任何能够延缓从大会议程上除去这个问题的建议。马立克促请政治委员会注意叙利亚代表团对于国民党诬告案所持态度的变化。在第一次会议时，叙利亚代表曾相当成功地揭露设立“调查团”进一步研究和调查国民党的诬告案这种建议是全然荒谬可笑的。然而在后来的会议中，叙利亚代表一反他以前的态度，却建议把国民党的诬告案送回临时委员会作进一步的研究。
    马立克批评了萨尔瓦多代表团的建议，该建议促请联合国会员国忠实地履行大会去年会议时通过的决议中所包含的建议。马立克追述称，这个决议是在美国统治集团政策在中国遭到失败后不久，在美英集团的压力下强使联合国第四届大会通过的。他并且追述，这个决议中包含的几点建议是，中国和中国人民应该继续履行美国垄断企业在国民党统治时代强使中国接受的条约的各项奴役条款。马立克说：这个非法歧视中国的决议是美英集团为了要在中国维持他们的统治而强制大会通过的。
    马立克强调中国人民在对国内反动派和国际帝国主义的联合力量进行斗争中赢得胜利的历史意义之后说：现在已是最后时机，帝国主义者及其代理人必须明白诸如萨尔瓦多提案之类的所有这种建议与提案都已不切合当前情况，而为过时和陈旧的概念了。马立克说，这种建议对中国人民是一种侮辱，因为中国人民已经成为他们自己命运的主人，没有人能干涉他们，中国人民将维护自己的事业。马立克说：考虑到萨尔瓦多关于伟大的中国人民的提案中的歧视与侮辱的性质，苏联代表团反对这项提案，并且将投票反对它，因为它是敌视中国人民而且是侮辱中国人民的。
    马立克在他演说中的结论部分抨击美国代表团对国民党诬告所采取的态度。马立克提醒政治委员会注意下列事实：美国统治集团在联合国第四届大会上强行通过了萨尔瓦多代表团现在建议中所提到的决议以后，在联合国第四届和第五届大会之间的这一段时期中他们已经粗野而无耻地违犯了这项决议中的一切建议。他们占领了台湾岛，在那里建立了受他们控制的傀儡政权，并给该政权以军事上及经济上的援助，从而干涉了中国的内政。马立克说：美国帝国主义者诽谤苏联以图掩盖他们对中国人民的侵略计划及侵略行动。
    马立克演说以后，国民党集团代表蒋廷黻接着发言，他不得不承认他的提案完全失败。他撤回他的提案，赞成叙利亚的提案。
    在本届大会上做美国代表团的传声筒的新西兰代表比林德森发表无礼的演说，责难政治委员会中的大多数准备将讨论中的问题“洗手不管”。比林德森用拳击桌，敦促大多数“再考虑”这种态度的后果。
    新西兰代表要求政治委员会通过叙利亚的提案，他说：大会至少应该给国民党政权以“道义上的支持”。
    萨尔瓦多代表继起发言，他就国民党撤回提案一事宣称：他的代表团对国民党提案所提出的修正案作为另一提案提出。萨尔瓦多的提案中要求联合国会员国注意“必须忠诚履行”联合国第四届大会的决议中所包含的建议。
    在英国代表发言以后，讨论结束，政治委员会进行表决。
    首先表决叙利亚提出的规定，将国民党的诬告案交回临时委员会的提案。该提案以三十五票的多数（美国、新西兰、拉丁美洲各国及大多数阿拉伯国家）对十七票（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、英国、印度、澳大利亚、加拿大等）获得通过。七票弃权（荷兰、法国、比利时等）。
    然后表决萨尔瓦多的提案，结果该提案以三十八票赞成（美国、英国、法国等）、六票反对（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克及南斯拉夫）获得通过。十四票弃权（印度、印尼、巴基斯坦等）。关于国民党诬告案的讨论至此结束，政治委员会休会。
    政治委员会将于十一月二十四日开始讨论美国侵略中国的问题，这问题是经苏联代表团的提议列入大会议程的。
