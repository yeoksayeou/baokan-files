Xinhua News Agency, November 7th: TASS, Moscow: Soviet Army Minister Vasilevsky issued an order in Moscow on the 7th, the full text of which is as follows: Comrades soldiers and sergeants! Comrades junior officers and generals!

Today, the Soviet Army, together with the entire Soviet people, celebrates the 33rd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

The Soviet working people are celebrating the great October Revolution Day with their brilliant victories in striving to successfully complete the Soviet post-war recovery and development of the national economy's Five-Year Plan. Under the wise leadership of the Bolshevik Party and their beloved Comrade Stalin, our working class, farmers, and intellectuals are enthusiastically realizing Stalin's plan to build a communist society.

The Soviet Army soldiers and our entire people are deeply proud of their socialist motherland and its glorious victories and achievements when welcoming the nationwide jubilant festival. These remarkable victories and achievements have vividly demonstrated the superiority of socialism over capitalism.

Last year, the Soviet Army achieved significant accomplishments in military and political training. Our army is closely united around the glorious Communist Party, the Soviet government, and our beloved leader and teacher, Comrade Stalin.

The Soviet people and their army are vigilantly watching the conspiracies of the enemies of peace and constantly remember the danger of war.

American and British imperialists are pursuing a policy of igniting another world war. Unscrupulous war-mongers have now gone so far as to take direct aggressive actions and launched a bloody intervention against the Korean people.

The imperialist aggressors have been opposed by a powerful and growing movement to defend peace. The wise Stalinist foreign policy and the Soviet Union's unwavering struggle for peace and cooperation among nations have gained increasing sympathy and support from all progressive humanity.

The Soviet Army faces an important task: to vigilantly protect the peace we have won, the borders of our motherland, and the constructive labor of the Soviet people.

Soviet soldiers must strive to achieve greater success in military and political training, constantly increase vigilance and strengthen the combat readiness of our troops.

The Soviet people can be confident that our army is highly loyal to the socialist motherland, to the Communist Party, and to Comrade Stalin, and will reliably protect the victories of the great October Revolution in the future.

Comrades soldiers and sergeants! Comrades junior officers and generals! On the occasion of the 33rd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, I salute you and congratulate you! To commemorate the nationwide jubilant festival, I order: Today, twenty volleys of artillery salutes shall be fired in our country's capital, Moscow, in the capitals of the various Union Republics, and in the four heroic cities of Kaliningrad, Lviv, Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, and Leningrad, Stalingrad, Sevastopol and Odessa.

Long live the great Soviet people and their heroic Soviet Army!

Long live our Soviet government!

Long live our Communist Party!

Long live the inspirer and organizer of all our victories – our beloved leader, wise teacher, and genius leader – the great Stalin!

Xinhua News Agency, November 7th: TASS, Moscow, November 7th: Soviet Navy Minister Yumashev issued an order on the 7th, the full text of which is as follows:

Comrades naval soldiers and non-commissioned officers! Comrades junior officers and flag officers!

The Soviet Navy today, together with the entire Soviet people, celebrates the 33rd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution.

Our country's working people, under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, are commemorating this great festival with significant achievements in all areas of socialist construction. The Five-Year Plan for the recovery and development of the national economy is being completed and overfulfilled. The power of our socialist motherland has been further consolidated. The culture and welfare of the Soviet people are growing.

The Soviet Navy has fulfilled the instructions of the Party and the government, as well as our leader and teacher Comrade Stalin, vigilantly guarding the maritime borders of the motherland, and greeting the 33rd anniversary of the Great October Revolution with new achievements in military and political training.

Our Soviet government is pursuing a peace-loving policy. The strength and scope of the international movement to defend peace are growing daily.

American and British imperialists are pursuing a policy of igniting another world war. They have progressed from threatening to launch war to openly invading Korea.

Under these circumstances, the sacred duty of naval personnel is to constantly increase the vigilance of ships and naval units, and strengthen their combat readiness, persistently master naval art, strengthen naval discipline, and expand the ranks of those personnel who have achieved excellent results in naval and political training.

Comrades naval soldiers and non-commissioned officers! Comrades junior officers and flag officers! On the anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution Day, I would like to salute you and congratulate you, and I wish you more achievements in naval and political training.

Long live the powerful Soviet motherland – the bastion of peace and democracy in the world!

Long live the heroic Soviet people and their Soviet Navy!

Long live our Soviet government!

Long live the Party of Lenin and Stalin!

Long live our leader and teacher, the great Stalin!

              Soviet Navy Minister, Admiral Yumashev (signed)

　　庆祝伟大十月革命三十三周年
    苏联陆军、海军部长发布命令
    美英帝国主义者们正在奉行着燃起另一次世界大战的政策。苏联陆海军经常提高警惕性，加强战斗准备。
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联陆军部长华西列夫斯基七日在莫斯科发布命令，全文如下：战士与士官同志们！校尉与将军同志们！
    今天，苏联陆军与全体苏联人民一同来庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十三周年。
    苏联劳动人民正以他们在努力争取胜利完成苏联战后恢复与发展国民经济五年计划的辉煌胜利，来庆祝伟大的十月革命节。我国工人阶级、农民和知识分子在布尔什维克党和他们敬爱的斯大林同志的英明领导下，正热烈地实现建设共产主义社会的斯大林计划。
    苏联陆军士兵与我国全体人民在迎接举国欢腾的节日时，深以他们的社会主义祖国及其辉煌胜利和成就而自豪。这些显赫的胜利与成就，已生动地显示出社会主义对资本主义的优越性。
    去年苏联陆军在军事与政治训练方面获得了重大的成就。我们的陆军紧密地团结在光荣的共产党、苏联政府及我们的亲爱的领袖和导师斯大林同志的周围。
    苏联人民及其陆军都警觉地注视着和平的敌人的阴谋，并且经常牢记着战争的危险。
    美英帝国主义者们正在奉行着燃起另一次世界大战的政策。肆无忌惮的战争贩子们现在已经进而采取直接的侵略行为，对朝鲜人民发动了血腥的干涉。
    帝国主义侵略者遭到了强大的、力量日益增强的保卫和平运动的反对。英明的斯大林外交政策和苏联争取各国间的和平与合作的坚持不渝的斗争，获得了全体进步人类的日益增加的同情与支持。
    苏联陆军面对着重要的任务——警惕地保护我们已经赢得的和平、我们祖国的边疆和苏联人民的建设性的劳动。
    苏联士兵必须努力争取在军事与政治训练方面取得更多的成绩，毫不间断地提高警惕性与加强我们部队的战斗准备。
    苏联人民可以坚信：我们的陆军高度地忠于社会主义祖国、忠于共产党与斯大林同志，在将来也要足可信赖地保护伟大的十月的胜利。
    战士与士官同志们！校尉与将军同志们！在伟大的十月社会主义革命三十三周年纪念日，我向你们致敬并祝贺你们！为了纪念举国欢腾的节日，我命令：今天在我们祖国的首都莫斯科、在各加盟共和国首都以及加里宁格勒、罗夫、伯力、海参崴和列宁格勒、斯大林格勒、悉瓦斯托波尔与奥德萨四个英雄的城市鸣放礼炮二十响。
    伟大的苏联人民及其英勇的苏联陆军万岁！
    我们的苏维埃政府万岁！
    我们的共产党万岁！
    我们的一切胜利的鼓舞者与组织者——我们敬爱的领袖，英明的导师及天才的领袖——伟大的斯大林万岁！
        苏联陆军部长苏联元帅华西列夫斯基（签字）
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科七日电：苏联海军部长尤马谢夫于七日发布命令，全文如下：
    海军士兵与军士同志们！校尉与将官同志们！
    苏联海军今天和全体苏联人民一道庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十三周年。
    在列宁和斯大林党领导下的我国劳动人民，以社会主义建设各领域中的重大成就来纪念这个伟大的节日。恢复与发展国民经济的五年计划正在完成和超额完成。我们社会主义祖国的威力已进一步地巩固。苏维埃人民的文化和福利正在增长。
    苏联海军履行了党和政府以及我们的领袖和导师斯大林同志的指示，警觉地警卫着祖国的海上边疆，并以军事和政治训练方面的新成绩来迎接伟大十月革命的三十三周年。
    我们的苏维埃政府正在奉行着爱好和平的政策。国际保卫和平运动的力量和规模正在日益扩大。
    美国和英国帝国主义者正在奉行着燃起另一次世界大战的政策。他们已从威胁要发动战争进到公开侵略朝鲜。
    在这些情况下，海军人员的神圣职责就是经常地提高舰只与海军部队的警惕性，并加强其战斗准备，坚持不渝地掌握海军艺术，加强海军纪律，和扩大那些在海军和政治训练方面得到优良成绩的人员的队伍。
    海军士兵与军士同志们！校尉与将官同志们！在伟大的十月社会主义革命节纪念日，我谨向你们致敬并祝贺你们，我祝你们在海军和政治训练方面获得更多的成绩。
    强大的苏维埃祖国——全世界和平与民主的堡垒万岁！
    英雄的苏联人民及其苏联海军万岁！
    我们的苏维埃政府万岁！
    列宁与斯大林的党万岁！
    我们的领袖和导师、伟大的斯大林万岁！
              苏联海军部长海军上将尤马谢夫签字
