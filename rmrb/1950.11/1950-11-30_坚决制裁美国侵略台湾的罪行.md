　　Resolutely Sanction the US Crime of Aggression Against Taiwan
    The statement by my country's special representative, Wu Xiuquan, at the United Nations Security Council, accusing the United States of armed aggression against Taiwan, reflects the firm will of our 475 million people to rise up against US aggression to defend national independence and world peace, and also reflects the rising just calls for peace from the people of all countries in the world. Together with the heroic battles of the Chinese People's Volunteers on the Korean front, it is a significant action to stop the United States from expanding its war of aggression and to maintain peace in the Far East. This just struggle against US aggression will surely be victorious.
    As everyone knows, Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory, just as California is part of American territory. Whether in history, law, or fact, this is beyond dispute. However, while launching the war of aggression against Korea, the US navy and air force openly occupied Taiwan. Especially since MacArthur's secret military meeting with Chiang Kai-shek in late July, US invading troops have not only directly occupied Taiwan, but have also formed a joint force with Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops under MacArthur's unified command, preparing to use the joint US-Chiang armed forces to oppose our country's legitimate actions to liberate Taiwan. At the same time, the United States has manipulated the United Nations to propose the so-called "future status of Formosa issue" and is carrying out various conspiracies around this proposal in an attempt to create a "legal" basis for its long-term occupation of Taiwan. This is clearly not only the most violent armed interference in China's internal affairs, but also the most open and blatant direct armed plunder of our country's territory. Although the US government has repeatedly hypocritically claimed that it "has no territorial ambitions towards China," in the face of ironclad facts, the United States' crime of aggression against China and violation of the United Nations Charter cannot be concealed by any shameless lies.
    The illegal act of the United States in armed occupation of Taiwan is clearly not a "temporary" or isolated action, but a component of the overall plan of the United States to further invade mainland China and intensify its aggression against Asian countries in order to expand the war of aggression in the Far East. Truman's statement on June 27 and the various acts of aggression taken in the Far East since then are a public exposure of this plan. All the facts prove that the main content of this plan is to use Japan as its general base for the war of aggression against Asia, and from this base, invade Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam from north to south, in order to systematically create a military encirclement of the People's Republic of China, thereby further infringing upon the People's Republic of China and provoking a Third World War. This arrogant and dangerous conspiracy of US imperialism must be given serious attention by all the people of China and the world.
    Now, the United States has not only directly occupied our country's Taiwan, but has also brought the flames of aggression in Korea to the northeastern border of our great motherland, directly threatening our country's security. Ignoring repeated protests from our government, US military aircraft invading Korea continue to violate our northeastern airspace, bombing and strafing peaceful cities and villages along the Yalu River in our Northeast, destroying the Yalu River railway bridge, killing and wounding our peaceful residents, and destroying the property of our people. These are clearly provocative actions by the United States to attempt to occupy our Northeast and to expand its war of aggression in a planned manner.
    At the same time, we see that the United States is intensifying its armed intervention in the Republic of Vietnam in the south. The US military mission headed by Brigadier General Brink has arrived in Saigon. The US naval vessels and aircraft recently dispatched to Vietnam are collaborating with the French invading army and the Bao Dai puppet government to launch armed attacks on the Vietnamese people. Under the instigation and support of the United States, French military aircraft invading Vietnam have even violated the airspace of our Yunnan and Guangxi provinces, carrying out armed provocations and strafing and bombing our residents. It is clear that the US armed intervention in Vietnam, like its aggression in Korea, is aimed not only at invading Vietnam, but also at threatening the borders of the People's Republic of China. This is yet another part of the US plan to invade our country as a whole. Therefore, the Chinese people cannot but pay close attention to the development of the US government's conspiracy to invade Vietnam.
    In order to conceal his conspiracy to expand aggression and paralyze the will of the Chinese people to resist US aggression, US President Truman made a deceptive speech on the so-called "Six-Nation Proposal" on the 16th of this month, in which he specifically stated: "We have never had any intention of bringing the war into China." However, before the United States armed occupation of Taiwan, didn't this same Truman also issue a statement on January 5 this year that he would "not interfere in Taiwan"? But his actual actions were to directly occupy Taiwan by armed force. When the US authorities launched the war of aggression against Korea, didn't they also say that the US troops invading Korea would never cross the 38th parallel? However, the US invading troops not only brazenly crossed the 38th parallel, but also openly advanced to the border of our Northeast. When the US invading troops advanced north towards the Yalu River, didn't the US authorities also say that "the US military will only advance to a line forty miles south of the Yalu River"? However, the US military not only advanced to the Yalu River border, but also shelled our Northeast Liaodong Province from the south bank of the Yalu River, and US military aircraft constantly crossed the Yalu River to invade our Northeast airspace. The countless bloody crimes of US aggression against our country will never be forgotten by the Chinese people and the people of the world. The US government will never be able to escape the responsibility for its own crimes.
    Recently, the United States ordered the Kuomintang remnant clique to submit a "complaint" against the Soviet Union to the UN General Assembly. This absurd and unfounded slander case was included in the agenda of the General Assembly through the manipulation of the US delegation. Its purpose is clearly not only to defend the corrupt Kuomintang remnant clique, but also to attempt to defend the US policy of aggression in Asia. The United States attempts to use this baseless "complaint" case to incite war sentiment against the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and to cover up its crime of expanding aggression in the Far East. However, this conspiracy of the United States has finally been shamefully bankrupted under the condemnation of human justice.
    At present, the crisis of the expanding war in the Far East continues to grow due to the armed aggression of the United States. The United Nations organization, established to safeguard world peace, clearly has the full responsibility to severely condemn and sanction this arrogant crime of aggression by the United States. The United Nations Security Council must immediately take effective measures to force the US government to completely withdraw its armed aggression forces from Taiwan and other territories belonging to China, and to ensure that the United States and other foreign invading troops withdraw from Korea, in order to guarantee peace and security in the Pacific and Asia. If the United Nations does not do so, but instead uses the mechanical majority manipulated by the United States to cover up the US crime of aggression, or acquiesces to the US occupation of Taiwan, then the United Nations will seriously violate its sacred charter and discredit its own credibility.
    We must point out that, due to the manipulation and obstruction of the United States, the legitimate representative of the People's Republic of China, as one of the permanent members of the Security Council, has consistently been denied access to the United Nations. This is a serious error that the United Nations organization urgently needs to correct. Although the Fifth UN General Assembly has seen the Soviet Union and other representatives make due efforts for peace, it has proved that it has not fulfilled its sacred responsibility to maintain world peace and security in some of the agendas discussed in the past, also due to the manipulation and obstruction of the United States. Now that the Fifth UN General Assembly is about to end, whether the United Nations organization will be completely turned into a tool of US aggressive policy, or whether it can still bear some responsibility for maintaining peace and justice, will also be further tested by its handling of our country's accusation against the United States for aggression against Taiwan.
    The Chinese people have never been and will never be afraid of resisting any imperialist aggression. We can never give in to or tolerate anyone who wants to invade our territorial sovereignty, anyone who wants to invade our neighbors, or anyone who threatens the security of our borders. No matter what kind of armed intervention the US government carries out, no matter what political excuses it adopts, or no matter what kind of name it steals from the United Nations, the Chinese people are determined to recover Taiwan from the US aggressors in order to complete the great cause of our national reunification. The Chinese people are determined to assist the Korean People's Army with volunteer forces to repel the US aggressors. If the US government stubbornly refuses to withdraw its invading troops from Taiwan and Korea, then the US government must bear full responsibility for all the consequences caused by its aggression against Taiwan and its aggression against Korea.

### 坚决制裁美国侵略台湾的罪行

　　坚决制裁美国侵略台湾的罪行
    我国特派代表伍修权，在联合国安全理事会上控诉美国武装侵略台湾的声明，反映了我国四万七千五百万人民为保卫祖国独立与世界和平而奋起反对美国侵略的坚决意志，同时也反映了世界各国人民日益高涨的要求和平的正义呼声。它与我国人民抗美援朝志愿部队在朝鲜前线的英勇作战，同是对于制止美国扩大侵略战争，与维护远东和平具有重大意义的举动。这个反对美国侵略的正义斗争，必将得到胜利。
    如众所周知，台湾之为中国领土不可分割的一部分，正如加里福尼亚州之为美国领土一样，不论在历史上，法律上，和事实上，都是无庸争辩的。但美国在发动侵略朝鲜战争的同时，其海空军随即公然侵占台湾，特别自七月底麦克阿瑟与蒋介石举行秘密军事会谈之后，美国侵略军队不但已经直接占领了台湾，而且已经在麦克阿瑟的统一指挥下，与蒋介石匪军组成联合部队，准备以美蒋的联合武装力量，来反对我国解放台湾之合法行动。同时，美国操纵联合国，提出所谓“福摩萨未来地位问题”，并围绕这个提案的周围进行各种阴谋活动，企图为其长期侵占台湾制造一个“合法”的根据。这显然不仅是对于中国内政最狂暴的武装干涉，而且是对于我国领土最公开露骨的直接武装掠夺。尽管美国政府曾多次伪善地声辩它“对中国并无领土野心”，但是，在铁一般的事实面前，美国侵略中国，破坏联合国宪章的罪行，是任何无耻的谎言所不能掩饰的了。
    美国武装侵占台湾的非法行为，显然不是什么“临时”的孤立的行动，而是美国进一步侵略中国大陆，并加紧侵略亚洲各国，以扩大远东侵略战争的总计划中的一个组成部分。杜鲁门六月二十七日的声明，及其后在远东所采取的各种侵略行动，正是这种计划的公开暴露。种种事实证明，这个计划的主要内容，就是以日本为其侵略亚洲的战争总基地，从这个基地出发，由北向南侵占朝鲜、台湾、越南，以便有计划地造成对我中华人民共和国的军事包围圈，借以进一步侵犯我中华人民共和国，并挑起第三次世界大战。美国帝国主义这个狂妄而危险的阴谋，是全中国和全世界人民所必须加以严重注意的。
    现在，美国不仅已经直接侵占了我国的台湾，而且已把侵略朝鲜的战火，燃烧到我伟大祖国的东北边疆，直接威胁我国的安全。美国侵略朝鲜的军用飞机，不顾我国政府的一再抗议，仍然连续不断地侵犯我东北领空，轰炸与扫射我东北鸭绿江沿岸的和平城乡，炸毁我鸭绿江铁桥，杀伤我国的和平居民，破坏我国人民的财产。这显然都是美国图谋侵占我东北和有计划地扩大侵略战争的挑衅行动。
    我们同时看到了美国在南方加紧其对越南共和国的武装干涉，以白林克准将为团长的美国军事使团已到达西贡，最近增派到越南的美国海军舰艇及飞机，正协同法国侵略军及保大傀儡政府，武装进攻越南人民。在美国的策动与支持之下，法国侵略越南的军用飞机亦竟然侵犯我国滇桂二省的领空，实行武装挑衅，并扫射和轰炸我国居民。很显然的，美国对越南的武装干涉，也正如它在朝鲜的侵略一样，其目的不仅在于侵略越南，而且在于威胁我中华人民共和国的边疆，这是美国侵略我国整个计划的又一部分。因此，中国人民不能不同时密切注视美国政府侵略越南阴谋的发展。
    美国总统杜鲁门，为掩饰其扩大侵略的阴谋及麻痹我国人民反抗美国侵略的意志，曾于本月十六日就所谓“六国提案”发表了一篇欺骗演说，其中特别声称：“我们从未有把战争带入中国的意图”。但是，在美国武装侵占台湾之前，同是这个杜鲁门在今年一月五日不也发表过“不干涉台湾”的声明吗？但其实际行动，却是直接武装占领台湾。美国当局在发动侵略朝鲜战争时，不也说过侵朝美军绝不超越三八线吗？但是，美国侵略军队不仅悍然越过了三八线，而且已公然进逼我东北边境。当美国侵略军队北向鸭绿江前进时，美国当局不也说过“美军只进抵离鸭绿江以南四十英里一线”吗？但美军不仅进到鸭绿江边境，并且从鸭绿江南岸炮轰我东北辽东省境，美军飞机则不断越过鸭绿江侵犯我东北领空。美国对我国侵略的无数血腥罪行，中国人民和全世界人民是决不会忘记的。美国政府要想逃脱对它自己的罪行所应负的责任，是万万不能的。
    最近美国命令国民党残余集团向联大提出对苏联的“控诉”案。这个荒诞无比的诽谤案由于美国代表团的操纵而被列入大会议程，其目的显然，也不仅是为腐败的国民党残余集团辩解，而且是企图为美国在亚洲的侵略政策辩解。美国图谋利用这个毫无根据的“控诉”案，煽动反对苏联和反对中华人民共和国的战争情绪，而掩饰其扩大侵略远东的罪行。但是，美国的这个阴谋，终于在人类正义的指责之下，可耻地破产了。
    目前远东战争扩大的危机，正由于美国的武装侵略而继续增长着。为保卫世界和平而建立起来的联合国组织，显然有完全的责任，严厉谴责并制裁美国这种狂妄的侵略罪行。联合国安全理事会必须立即采取有效措施，使美国政府自台湾及其他属于中国的领土上完全撤出它的武装侵略力量，使美国及其他外国侵略军队一律撤出朝鲜，以保证太平洋的与亚洲的和平与安全。如果联合国不这样做，而相反地以美国操纵的机械多数掩饰美国侵略的罪行，或默认美国侵占台湾的事实，那么联合国就严重地违反了它的神圣的宪章，而使它自己的信誉扫地。
    我们必须指出，由于美国的操纵与阻挠，作为常任理事国之一的中华人民共和国的合法代表，始终被拒绝在联合国之外，这是联合国组织急待纠正的一个严重错误。联合国五届大会，虽有苏联及其他代表为和平作了应有的斗争，但同样由于美国的操纵与阻挠，以致在以往所讨论的若干议程中，证明它并未负起维护世界和平与安全的神圣责任。现在，五届联大快要结束了，联合国组织是否彻底成为美国侵略政策的工具，抑或还能担负某些维护和平及正义的职责，亦将由它对于我国控诉美国侵略台湾问题的处理，得到进一步的考验。
    中国人民从不也永不害怕抵抗任何帝国主义的侵略。谁要想侵略我国的领土主权，谁要侵略我国的邻邦，威胁我国边疆的安全，我们是决不能让步与容忍的。不管美国政府进行怎样的武装干涉，也不管它采取任何政治的借口，或盗用什么样的联合国的名义，中国人民决心要从美国侵略者手中收复台湾，以完成我国统一的伟大事业。中国人民决心以志愿部队援助朝鲜人民军击退美国侵略者。如果美国政府顽固地不从台湾和朝鲜撤退其侵略军队，那末美国政府就必须对它侵略台湾及侵略朝鲜所引起的一切后果，负完全的责任。
