[Report from this newspaper] The anti-American and aid-Korea, home-defending and nation-protecting declaration and the five patriotic pledges proposed by the industrial and commercial circles in Beijing have become the unified action goals of the city's industrialists and businessmen in resisting America and aiding Korea after discussions in various industries. Various industries have also put forward specific fighting slogans in connection with their own businesses, contributing all their strength to defending their homes and protecting the country, and assisting the government in establishing a strong economic army.

At the meetings, all industries first made accusations, recognizing that American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people and Chinese national industrialists and businessmen. At the cigarette industry conference, Zhao Shitai, manager of Yuhua Cigarette Factory, said indignantly: In the past, American imperialism monopolized the Chinese cigarette market. They colluded with Chinese bureaucratic capitalists to destroy and oppress Chinese industry and commerce, not only importing a large number of American cigarettes, but also setting up factories in China to manufacture them. The cigarette factories opened by Chinese had little capital and were unable to raise their heads under the pressure. At the same time, they also controlled imported raw materials such as paper. Chinese cigarette factories could not apply for import exchange settlement from the Kuomintang reactionary government, so they had no raw materials for production. Before liberation, the eleven mechanized cigarette factories in Beijing were all in a state of shutdown or semi-shutdown. After liberation, thanks to the acquisition and support of state-owned trading organizations, they have developed normally, and the monthly output of some larger cigarette factories is even more than the annual output before liberation. At the foreign wine and soda industry conference, Li Yihou, manager of Daxiyang Wine Company, said: Before liberation, a large number of smuggled "foreign wines" from the United States were dumped on the Chinese market. Because they were not taxed, the prices were low, and our products were excluded from the market, and the factory production was miserable. Therefore, if our national industry and commerce want to develop, we must defeat American imperialist aggression and never be a colony again. At the conferences of the construction industry, dairy industry, and knitting industry, after recalling the destruction they suffered in the past, their hatred for American imperialism rose, and they unanimously proposed to take action. In addition to the common action slogans such as "firmly stand, recognize friends and enemies, prevent bandits and spies, and raise vigilance" and "stabilize prices, step up production, strengthen labor-capital unity, and do a good job in public-private relations," each industry also put forward its own fighting slogans. The knitting and weaving and dyeing industries proposed: Production must achieve solid quality, increased quantity, save raw materials, and protect equipment; the mechanized flour industry and the grain industry proposed: ensure sufficient supply of grain, no profiteering, no adulteration, and no hoarding; the oil, wine, sauce and vinegar industry proposed to ensure the supply of non-staple food for the people; the native produce and mountain goods industry proposed to assist the government in regulating materials and communicate the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas; the hotel industry proposed to resolutely support the wine monopoly policy, support the government's tax policy and complete tax payment obligations; and the construction industry proposed to contribute all our construction experience and capabilities to national defense. All industries have stated that they are willing to resolutely use these practical actions to enhance the combat strength of the economic front and fight for resisting America, aiding Korea, defending the home and protecting the country.

　　京市工商界各行业分别集会
    控诉美帝摧残民族工商业
    决心实践工商界五项爱国公约
    【本报讯】京市工商业界提出的抗美援朝保家卫国宣言和五项爱国公约，经过各行业纷纷集会讨论，已经成为全市工商业者抗美援朝一致的行动目标。各行业并结合本行业务提出了具体奋斗口号，为保家卫国贡献一切力量，协助政府建立坚强的经济大军。
    各行业在集会中都首先提出控诉，认识到美帝是中国人民和中国民族工商业者的死敌。卷烟业大会上，裕华烟厂经理赵世泰愤慨地说：过去美帝国主义垄断中国卷烟市场，他们和中国官僚资产阶级结合起来，摧残和压迫中国工商业，不单大量输入美国烟，而且在中国设厂制造。中国人开的烟厂资本小，被压得抬不起头来。同时他们还控制盘纸等进口原料。中国烟厂向国民党反动政府申请不到进口结汇，就没有原料进行生产。解放前，北京的十一家机制卷烟工厂都陷于停工或半停工状态。解放后，由于国营贸易机构的收购扶植，得到正常发展，较大的卷烟工厂月产量有的比解放前的年产量还多。洋酒汽水业大会上，大喜洋酒公司经理李宜侯说：解放前，美国大批走私的“洋酒”在中国市场倾销。因为没有上税，价格低廉，我们的出品被排出市场，工厂生产惨淡极了。所以，我们民族工商业要发展，一定要击败美帝侵略，绝不能再做殖民地。建筑业、牛乳业、针织业等大会上，也都在回忆过去遭受摧残情况后，对美帝仇视情绪高涨，一致提出要行动起来。各行业除去提出“坚定立场，认清敌友，防匪防特，提高警惕”和“稳定物价，加紧生产，加强劳资团结，搞好公私关系”等共同的行动口号外，并分别提出本行业的奋斗口号。针织、织染业提出：生产一定要达到质的坚固，量的增多，节约原料，保护器材；机制面粉业和粮食业提出：保证充分供应粮食，不套购，不掺假，不投机居奇；油酒酱醋业提出保证供应人民副食品；土产、山货业提出要协助政府调剂物资，沟通城乡物资交流；酒店业提出坚决拥护酒业专卖政策，拥护政府税收政策完成纳税义务；建筑业则提出把我们一切建筑的经验能力供献到国防上去。各行业都表示，愿坚决以这些实际行动来增强经济战线的战斗力量，为抗美援朝保家卫国而斗争。
