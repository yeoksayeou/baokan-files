Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 21st: Serenni, the Italian representative to the Second World Peace Congress and Secretary-General of the Italian Peace Committee, told the press on the 19th that over 17 million people in Italy had signed the peace declaration. During the signature campaign, 20,000 peace committees were established throughout the country. Actively participating in the peace movement are not only workers and working farmers, but also broad sections of the middle class; not only Communists and Socialists, but also Catholics, Monarchists, and Republicans. Serenni emphasized that the British government's obstruction of the World Peace Congress from being held in Sheffield has further strengthened the unity of the Italian delegation. Those representatives who previously thought Britain was democratic have now realized that the British bourgeoisie, serving American imperialism, has long abandoned all democratic traditions. Those representatives who previously doubted whether there was true democracy in Poland have now personally seen that people of all parties and political beliefs can freely express their opinions in Warsaw and participate in discussions on defending peace.

The German representative, writer Anna Seghers, told the press that the German people have received a good education in the war and post-war years, and they will no longer be fooled. The peace-loving democratic forces in Germany are developing into an anti-aggression force day by day. The American warmongers' attempt to cultivate revenge sentiments among the German people is bound to fail. They can no longer throw the German people into another war.

　　意德出席和大代表
    畅谈意德和平运动
    【新华社二十一日讯】综合塔斯社华沙消息：意大利出席第二届世界保卫和平大会代表、意大利和平委员会总书记塞伦尼，十九日向新闻界谈称：意大利已有一千七百多万人民在和平宣言上签了名。在征集签名运动中，全国各地建立了两万个和平委员会。积极参加和平运动的，不仅有工人和劳动农民，并且有广大的中等阶层的人民；不仅有共产党人和社会党人，还有天主教徒、君主政制派与共和派的人们。塞伦尼着重指出：英国政府阻挠和大在设菲尔德举行，已进一步加强了意大利代表团的团结。从前认为英国民主的那些代表们，现在已认识到为美帝国主义服务的英国资产阶级，早已抛弃了一切的民主传统。而从前怀疑波兰是否有真正民主的那些代表们，现在已经亲眼看到不分党派和政治信仰的人们，都可以在华沙自由地表示意见，并参加讨论保卫和平的问题。
    德国代表、作家西格斯向新闻界谈称：德国人民在战争中和战后的年代中，已经受到良好的教育，他们再不会受人愚弄了。德国爱好和平的民主力量，正一天天地发展成为反侵略力量。美国战争贩子企图在德国人民中培养复仇情绪的图谋必归失败。他们再也不能把德国人民投入另一次战争。
