Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 12th (Tass): The strike of telephone repairmen, operators, and other telephone workers is increasingly cutting off telephone communications in the United States. It is generally believed that currently, 85,000 workers are directly participating in the strike or refusing to cross the picket lines of striking workers to handle unaffected business.

Approximately half – 33,000 actual striking workers – are concentrated in the state of Michigan, striking in all parts of the telephone monopoly's local branches controlled by telephone industry monopolists. As for the rest of the country, only telephone repairmen and operators are on strike, opposing the "Western Electric Company" telephone monopoly, a major electrical machine manufacturing company controlled by the same telephone monopoly.

Authorities in New Jersey and Wisconsin are considering whether to invoke state laws to deal with striking workers who are disrupting "public utilities." In several cities in Arkansas and Indiana, courts have issued injunctions prohibiting striking workers from organizing pickets.

The striking workers are demanding substantial wage increases and opposing the monopolists' attempt to "freeze" wages for eighteen months.

　　美电话工人大罢工
    八万五千人采取行动要求增加工资
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约十二日电：电话装修工人、接线生及其他电话工人的罢工，日益切断了美国电话通讯。一般人士相信，目前直接参加罢工的，以及不肯通过罢工工人纠察线去处理不受罢工影响的业务的工人，已有八万五千名。
    约有半数——三万三千实际罢工工人，集中在密执安州内，为电话业垄断资本家们所控制的电话垄断企业各地分公司的一切部分都罢工了，至于全国其余部分，仅电话装修工人和接线生在罢工，反对“西方电气公司”的电话垄断企业，该公司是为同一家电话垄断企业所控制的主要电气工作母机制造公司。
    新泽西州和威斯康星州的当局在考虑是否要引用州法律来对付妨害“公用事业”的罢工工人，在阿肯色州和印第安纳州内若干城市中，法院已颁布禁令，不准罢工工人组织纠察队。
    罢工工人要求大量增加工资，反对垄断资本家要将工资“冻结”十八个月。
