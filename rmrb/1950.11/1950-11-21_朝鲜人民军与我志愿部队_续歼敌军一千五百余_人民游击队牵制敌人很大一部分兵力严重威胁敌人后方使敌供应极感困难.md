Xinhua News Agency, North Korea, 20th—The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army issued a communique stating that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in their operations against the American aggressor troops and the Syngman Rhee puppet army from November 9th to November 17th, achieved the following results, according to incomplete statistics:

	1.  Enemy killed or wounded: 48 American soldiers killed, 1,336 wounded (including one puppet officer); 44 American soldiers captured, 122 puppet soldiers captured (including 3 officers), totaling 1,550 puppet troops and American soldiers killed, wounded, or captured.
	2.  Major captures: 32 light and heavy machine guns, 107 automatic rifles, 15 rifles and carbines, 32 carbines, 2 recoilless rifles, 2 60mm mortars, 2 rocket launchers, 30 various shells, 5,930 various bullets, 2 pairs of binoculars, 1 radio transmitter.
	3.  One tank and five jeeps destroyed.

Xinhua News Agency, 20th—The heroic Korean People's Guerrilla Forces, fighting valiantly in the enemy's rear, are currently tying down a significant portion of the enemy's forces and seriously threatening the enemy's rear. MacArthur's headquarters has been forced to admit: "The Communist guerrillas are so well organized that their efforts behind the lines are now integrated with the developments on the front lines." "Guerrilla activities have definite methods and objectives." "They now pose a greater threat to our rear lines." (International News Service, Tokyo, 17th)

According to Reuters correspondent Valentine on the 17th: "In the vast rear areas," "it takes four to five soldiers to deal with one guerrilla." Valentine revealed that the Korean People's Guerrilla Forces are currently tying down one American division, three Rhee puppet divisions, the Turkish infantry brigade of the accomplice countries, and one Philippine combat regiment. Valentine pointed out the serious threat of the guerrillas to the enemy's supplies, saying: "The main target of the guerrillas is the supply line. As the United Nations forces gradually advance north, they increasingly rely on the hundreds of miles of roads behind them. These roads are the only link with the supply bases. The guerrillas are now doing everything possible to cut these lifelines." According to the National News Agency, MacArthur's headquarters spokesman also admitted that, as a result of guerrilla attacks, the American and Rhee military convoys have been "forced to travel on secondary and temporary roads."

Armies waging wars of aggression on other people's land face many insurmountable difficulties when fighting against people waging anti-aggression wars on their own land. Reuters correspondent Valentine cited one difficulty: "A major difficulty for the United Nations forces in fighting the guerrillas is that they have to fight them on the Communists' own land. Most of them are familiar with the terrain of every hill and also have the ability to climb mountains. On the other hand, the United Nations forces are often exhausted from trekking along mountain paths and find it difficult to fight in this mountainous terrain." People's guerrillas often "suddenly descend from the mountains to attack transport convoys, and before the United Nations forces can send reinforcements to deal with them, they have already run back into the mountains and disappeared without a trace."

Meanwhile, according to a report by the National News Agency on the 18th, "due to the increasingly intensified activities of the Communist guerrillas in the entire area north of the 38th parallel," Pyongyang, occupied by the American military, has been forced to become "an armed barracks at night." As a result of guerrilla attacks on Pyongyang's power system, the city's electricity "has been slow to recover" to this day. The guerrillas recently attacked the American radio station outside Pyongyang twice. The guerrilla attacks "have forced the American and South Korean military police to deploy sentries at all bridges and road intersections in and around Pyongyang at night." However, "after nightfall, gun battles have become commonplace."

The powerful threat posed by the Korean People's Guerrilla Forces to the enemy's rear is causing the American military staff "to feel depressed." However, "there is no indication that the United Nations Command has made any real progress in its efforts to contain the guerrillas."

　　朝鲜人民军与我志愿部队
    续歼敌军一千五百余
    人民游击队牵制敌人很大一部分兵力严重威胁敌人后方使敌供应极感困难
    【新华社朝鲜北部某地二十日电】朝鲜人民军总司令部发表公报称：朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队自十一月九日至十一月十七日对美国侵略军和李承晚伪军作战中，据不完全统计，获得战绩如下：
    一、毙伤敌：美军四八名，伤军一、三三六名（内伪官一名）；俘美军四四名，伪军一二二名（内官三），共毙伤俘伪军及美军一、五五○名。
    二、主要缴获：轻重机枪三二挺，自动步枪一○七枝，长短枪一五枝，卡宾枪三二枝，无座力炮二门，六○炮二门，火箭筒两个，各种炮弹三十发，各种子弹五、九三○发，望远镜两付，无线电机一部。
    三、击毁坦克一辆、吉普车五辆。
    【新华社二十日讯】在敌人后方英勇战斗的朝鲜人民游击部队，现正牵制着敌人巨大兵力，并严重地威胁着敌人的后方。麦克阿瑟总部已被迫承认：“共产党的游击队组织得这样良好，他们在战线后方的努力现在已和前线的发展结成一体了。”“游击队活动有一定的方法和目的。”“他们现在已形成了对我们后方战线的更大的威胁。”（国际新闻社东京十七日电）
    据路透社记者范伦丁十七日报道：在“广大后方地区”，“要用四个到五个士兵来对付一个游击队员”。范伦丁透露：朝鲜人民游击队现正牵制着美军一个师、李伪军三个师、帮凶国家的土耳其步兵旅和菲律宾一团战斗部队。范伦丁道出了游击队对敌人供应的严重威胁称：“游击队的主要目标是供应线。当联合国部队逐渐向北推进时，它越来就越依靠他们背后几百英里长的公路。这些公路是和供应基地的唯一的联系。游击队现在正尽一切力量来切断这些生命线。”另据国新社讯：麦克阿瑟总部发言人也承认：由于游击队袭击的结果，美李军的输送队，已“被迫在次等的和暂时的道路上走。”
    在别人的国土上进行侵略战争的军队，对在自己的国土上进行反侵略战争的人民作战，有许多无法克服的困难。路透社记者范伦丁举出了一个困难：“联合国军队对游击队作战的一大困难，是不得不在共军自己的土地上打他们。他们大多数都熟悉每一座小山的地势，而且也有爬山的本领。另一方面联合国的军队却常由于在山径小路上跋涉，弄得精疲力尽，并且觉得难以在这种山地地形内作战。”人民游击队时常从山上“突然下来向运输队猛扑一阵，在联合国军队还没有调来援军对付他们之前，就已跑回山里变得无影无踪了。”
    同时，据国新社十八日电报道：“由于三八线以北整片地区共产党游击队活动越来越加紧”，已迫使美军侵占下的平壤“在晚间成了武装的兵营”。游击队袭击平壤电力系统的结果，使平壤的电力至今“迟迟不能恢复”。游击队最近又两次袭击了平壤市外的美国无线电台。游击队的袭击，“迫使美国和南朝鲜宪兵部队晚间在平壤市内和周围的一切桥梁和公路交叉点都布上岗哨”。但是，“入夜以后，枪击战却成为司空见惯的事情。”
    朝鲜人民游击队对敌人后方的强大威胁，正使美军参谋人员“闷闷不乐”。但是，“还没有什么迹象表明联合国指挥部在遏止游击队的努力上，有什么真正的进展。”
