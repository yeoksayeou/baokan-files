　　A Gift to Celebrate the October Revolution Day
　　Industrial Model Worker Guo Yingchen
　　The great October Revolution Day is a day of joy and celebration for our proletariat. Because the October Revolution not only allowed the Soviet people, occupying one-sixth of the earth's surface, to stand up and no longer be oppressed by imperialism and the feudal, bureaucratic bourgeoisie, but it also pointed out the direction of victory for the liberation struggles of the Chinese people and other small and weak nations in the world's colonies; it powerfully encouraged the victorious advance of the Chinese revolution. This year, after celebrating the first National Day of the People's Republic of China, we are celebrating the greatest joyous event in the world – the October Revolution Day. We will express our gratitude to the great leader of the world proletariat revolution, Marshal Stalin, with unparalleled enthusiasm. We also thank the Soviet experts for their assistance in the production and construction of Anshan Iron and Steel in the past year. And we wish the happy Soviet people continued victory in building the great socialist cause.

　　However, the evil American imperialism, because of the success of Soviet socialist construction and the victory of the Chinese revolution, hates us even more. The warmongers are using every means to carry out a brutal war of aggression in Korea, and using aircraft to invade our sacred territory, bombing and strafing our compatriots. These beastly acts fully expose the wolfish ambition of American imperialism to invade China. We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's protest and his statement that we cannot sit idly by while our friendly neighbor suffers from American imperialist aggression and slaughter. We will take practical actions to defend the sacred border of the motherland and support Korea. When we held the National Model Workers Representative Conference in Beijing, Chairman Mao personally instructed us to strive to complete the construction of a strong national defense force and a strong economic force. We not only keep every word of Chairman Mao in our hearts, but we also bring it to all the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel. In October, all the workers implemented Chairman Mao's instructions, and the output of steel greatly exceeded the plan. Comrade Yang Chunmao, the company's supervisory committee member, also called on us on behalf of the Party to launch a patriotic production competition to increase production, improve quality, combat waste, improve economic accounting, and ensure attendance. In order to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions and respond to the Party's call, and to smash American imperialist aggression with practical actions, the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League of our electrical repair plant will certainly unify our steps in November, continue to launch a plant-wide production competition movement, and ensure that we complete the annual production plan one month ahead of schedule; the product quality will reach Grade 1 for more than 85% of the products, and the attendance rate will be more than 95%. In addition to consolidating the existing seven Ma Hengchang-style groups, we will continue to cultivate more than seven Ma Hengchang-style groups. We will implement workshop costing in four units, including instrument and new motor manufacturing, to reduce costs by 5% this month and strive to create model workshops. We will strengthen current affairs education, consolidate organizational strength, carry out mass anti-espionage and anti-special agent work, improve the emergency repair team, and resolutely complete the four defense tasks. As a gift to celebrate the October Revolution Day.

　　庆祝十月革命节的献礼
    工业劳模  郭英忱
    伟大的十月革命节是咱们无产阶级欢欣鼓舞普天同庆的一天。因为由于十月革命一声炮响，不但占全地球面积六分之一的苏联人民从此站立起来，再也不受帝国主义和封建、官僚资产阶级的压迫了。同时它更为我们中国人民和其他世界上殖民地的国家弱小民族的解放斗争指出了胜利的方向；有力地鼓舞了中国革命的胜利前进。我们今年在庆祝中华人民共和国第一个国庆节之后，来庆祝世界上最大的一件喜事——十月革命节，我们将以无比的热情，感谢伟大的世界无产阶级革命导师斯大林大元帅。我们也感谢苏联专家们一年来对我们鞍钢生产建设上的帮助。并祝幸福的苏联人民在建设伟大的社会主义事业上永远胜利前进。
    但是万恶的美帝由于苏联社会主义建设成功和中国革命的胜利，更加仇视我们，战争贩子们用尽千方百计在朝鲜进行惨无人道的侵略战争，并用飞机侵入我们的神圣国土，轰炸和扫射我们同胞，这些兽行充分暴露了狼心狗肺的美帝侵略中国的野心；我们坚决拥护周外长的抗议和不能坐视我们友邻遭受美帝侵略和屠杀的声明，并用实际行动保卫神圣祖国边疆和支援朝鲜。我们在北京开全国劳模代表会议的时候，毛主席曾亲自指示我们要为完成建设强大的国防力量与强大的经济力量而奋斗。毛主席的话我们不但每一句都记在心里，我们也把他带到鞍钢全体职工中。在十月份里，全体职工执行了毛主席的指示，钢铁产量大大的超过计划。公司的监委杨春茂同志也代表党号召我们要展开提高产量、质量、反浪费，搞好经济核算和保证出勤率，展开爱国主义的生产竞赛。为了坚决执行毛主席的指示和响应党的号召，用实际行动来粉碎美帝侵略，我们电修厂党、政、工、团一定在十一月里统一步调，继续展开全厂生产竞赛运动，保证提前一月完成全年生产计划；产品质量达到百分之八十五以上为一级品，出勤率百分之九十五以上。除了巩固已经出现的七个马恒昌式小组外，并继续培养七个以上的马恒昌式小组。在计器和新马达制造等四个单位试行车间成本，做到本月降低成本百分之五，争取出现模范车间。加强时事教育，巩固组织力量开展群众性的防奸防特工作，搞好抢修队，坚决完成四防任务。作为庆祝十月革命节的献礼。
