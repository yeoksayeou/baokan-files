Celebrating the 33rd Anniversary of the October Revolution
    Nine-Three Society
    At a time when the imperialists, headed by the United States, are frantically undermining world peace, escalating the Korean War of aggression, and seriously threatening our country's security, the arrival of the great 33rd anniversary of the October Revolution fills us with boundless excitement.

    The October Revolution, with a single shot, brought forth the first socialist country on one-sixth of the earth. It not only brought true peace, democracy, freedom, and happiness to mankind, inspiring the working people of the world to struggle and advance, but also the many valuable experiences of the Soviet working people, under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin party, in their 33 years of struggle for peace, democracy, freedom, and happiness, are well worth our humble study:

    First, we must learn from the Soviet working people's patriotic spirit in defeating the encirclement of fourteen imperialist powers during the Civil War. At that time, the imperialists colluded with the White bandits, domestic counter-revolutionaries in the Soviet Union, spreading the flames of war to eight-tenths of Soviet territory, causing extremely severe damage to the Soviet Union. Under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin party, the Soviet working people, in the face of extreme hardship, struggled arduously and finally shattered the encirclement of the imperialist bloc and eliminated the White bandits. This great patriotic spirit not only laid the foundation for the happiness of the Soviet people but also opened up a path of happiness for humanity worldwide. Today, the situation of the Chinese people is similar to that of the Soviet people at that time, but our conditions today are much better than those of the Soviet Union then: we have the ever-growing peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union standing on our side, and the united strength of billions of peace-loving people around the world, and we have a long-tested and incomparably strong people's armed forces. Now, as long as we learn from the Soviet people's spirit of hard work and patriotism, we will certainly be able to shatter the enemy's offensive and achieve final victory.

    Second, the foundation for the success of 33 years of socialist construction lies in the Bolshevik Party, which led the revolution, mastering Marxism-Leninism and applying the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts to all economic, cultural, and political construction. The Chinese Communist Party, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, liberated all of China and achieved a fundamental victory, also because it applied the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts, combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution. Today, as we commemorate the October Revolution, the Chinese people must intensify their study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, arm our minds, and consolidate our victory.

    Third, the great spirit of socialism is internationalism. World peace is indivisible. The U.S. imperialists' expansion of aggression in Korea is completely following the old path of the Japanese imperialists—to conquer the world, first conquer China; to conquer China, first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia; to conquer Manchuria and Mongolia, first conquer Korea. As we commemorate the October Revolution today, we must recognize the ferocity of U.S. imperialism, highly develop the spirit of internationalism, and with millions of times the confidence and strength, assist Korea and shatter the imperialist aggression plan headed by the United States.

    Fourth, Chairman Mao said: there are only two camps in the world, one is the socialist peace camp, and the other is the imperialist aggressive camp. There is no third road—either side with the socialist peace camp or side with the imperialist aggressive camp. In order to resist imperialist aggression, we must resolutely stand on the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, strengthen the power of the peace camp, and shatter imperialist aggression.

    Finally, as we commemorate the October Revolution, we cannot but thank the Soviet Union for the great friendly assistance it has given us in all aspects of the Chinese revolutionary war and political, economic, cultural, and construction work over the past 33 years.

    Long live the great Soviet October Revolution!
    Long live the unity of peace-loving people all over the world!
    Long live the victory of the Korean people's war against American aggression!
    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people!
    Long live Marshal Stalin, the great teacher of progressive mankind all over the world!

　　庆祝十月革命三十三周年
    九三学社
    正当以美国为首的帝国主义者、疯狂地破坏世界和平、扩大侵略朝鲜战争、严重的威胁到我国安全的时候，适逢十月革命三十三周年伟大节日的到来，殊使我们感到无限的兴奋。
    十月革命一声炮响，地球上六分之一的土地出现了第一个社会主义国家之后，他不仅给人类带来了真正的和平民主、自由和幸福，鼓舞全世界劳动人民，斗争前进，而且苏联劳动人民在列宁斯大林党的领导之下，三十三年来为和平、民主、自由、幸福而斗争的许多宝贵经验，也都是很值得我们虚心学习的：
    第一、我们要学习苏联劳动人民在内战时期击溃十四个帝国主义围攻的爱国主义精神。当时，帝国主义和苏联国内反革命的白党分子相勾结，把战火燃烧到苏联十分之八的地区，给苏联以极惨重的破坏，苏联劳动人民在列宁斯大林党的领导之下，在极端困难的遭遇中，艰苦奋斗，终于把帝国主义集团的包围粉碎了，把白党消灭了。这种伟大的爱国主义精神，不但奠定了苏联人民的幸福基础，更给世界人类开辟了幸福的道路。今天，人民中国的处境，虽和当时苏联人民的情形近似，但我们今日的条件，都比当时苏联优越得多：我们有站在我们方面的以苏联为首的日渐壮大的和平民主阵营，及全世界亿万爱好和平的人民的团结力量，我们有久经锻炼、坚强无比的人民武装力量。我们现在只要学习苏联人民艰苦奋斗的爱国主义精神，我们是一定能够粉碎敌人的进攻，取得最后胜利的。
    第二、社会主义三十三年建设成功的基础，是由于领导革命的布尔塞维克党，掌握着马列主义，发挥了实事求是的科学精神于一切经济、文化和政治建设。中国共产党在毛主席英明领导之下，解放了全中国，取得了基本的胜利，也是由于发挥了以马列主义的普遍真理和中国革命实践相结合的实事求是的科学精神。今天纪念十月革命节，全中国人民更要加紧的学习马列主义和毛泽东思想，武装我们的头脑，巩固我们的胜利。
    第三、社会主义伟大的精神，便是国际主义。世界和平是不可分割的。美帝扩大侵略朝鲜，完全走的是日帝——欲征服全世界，先征服中国，欲征服中国，先征服满蒙，欲征服满蒙，先征服朝鲜——的旧路。我们今天纪念十月革命，必须认清美帝的凶恶，高度的发挥国际主义精神，以百万分的信心与力量援助朝鲜，粉碎美国为首的帝国主义的侵略计划。
    第四、毛主席说过：世界只有两个阵营，一边是社会主义的和平阵营，另一边是帝国主义的侵略阵营，不倒向社会主义的和平阵营，便倒向帝国主义的侵略阵营，第三条路线是没有的。我们为反抗帝国主义的侵略，必须坚决的站在以苏联为首的和平阵营，加强和平阵营的力量，粉碎帝国主义的侵略。
    最后，我们纪念十月革命，更不能不感谢苏联三十三年来对中国革命战争和政治、经济、文化、建设各方面所给予我们的伟大的友谊帮助。
    伟大的苏联十月革命万岁！
    全世界爱好和平的人民团结万岁！
    朝鲜人民反美侵略战争胜利万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的中国人民领袖毛主席万岁！
    全世界进步人类导师斯大林大元帅万岁！
