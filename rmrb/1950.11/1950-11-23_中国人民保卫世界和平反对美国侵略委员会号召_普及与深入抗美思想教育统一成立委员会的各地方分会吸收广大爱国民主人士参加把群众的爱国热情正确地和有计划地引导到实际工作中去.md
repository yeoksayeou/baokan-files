Xinhua News Agency, 22nd: The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression issued a notice to its local branches and the World Peace Committee and the Committee Against American Aggression. The full text is as follows:

American imperialism has launched a war of aggression in Korea and has carried out increasingly brutal provocations and aggression against our country, seriously threatening China's security. Patriotic people from all walks of life in China, in order to defend the motherland, support the Korean people, and defend world peace, have enthusiastically launched a movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country. This movement is completely justified and righteous. The current task of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression is to support and lead the patriotic people's movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country throughout the country, and to widely carry out ideological education against American aggression, so as to popularize and deepen it. The following is a notice to local branches and the World Peace Committee and the Committee Against American Aggression regarding the work to be carried out by the Committee at present:

1. The Chinese people's movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country is a broad mass movement. This movement should be widely launched among the broad masses of people from all walks of life throughout the country. It is hoped that local democratic parties, people's organizations, factories, schools, institutions, troops, and patriotic advanced elements among the broad masses will be contacted to carry out propaganda work to the broad masses, so as to popularize current political education on resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending the country, and to promote the movement to hate, despise, and scorn American aggressors, in order to arouse the common hatred of the American aggressors among people from all walks of life in the country and eliminate the harmful influence of American imperialism remaining among a part of the Chinese people.

2. Defending world peace and opposing American aggression are essentially two inseparable aspects of the same thing. In order to more effectively carry out the Chinese people's movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country, local World Peace Committees or Committees Against American Aggression that have not yet been reorganized should be merged or reorganized immediately to form local branches of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression. In all large administrative regions, provinces, and cities where the above-mentioned organizations do not exist, branches of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression should be established immediately. The constituent units of local branches should absorb representatives from various democratic parties, people's organizations, and other non-party patriotic and democratic figures to participate.

3. Under the local branches of the local branches of the Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, branches of a grassroots nature such as factories and schools will generally no longer be established. The development of the movement to resist America and aid Korea in various places can be carried out by local branches promoting the work of local people's organizations and people from all walks of life, and through them, carrying out propaganda to the broad masses of unorganized people, and systematically leading the people to carry out various voluntary activities to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country.

4. The movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country is a relatively long-term patriotic movement. In carrying out this movement, in addition to conducting current political education, relevant national defense education, and necessary voluntary actions, the Chinese people should correctly guide the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses into practical work, so that the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country is combined with the task of adhering to their posts. Only in this way can enthusiasm be transformed into strength, and can our work be done more effectively, and can the great patriotic movement of the Chinese people to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country on a voluntary basis, under the unified leadership of a planned and step-by-step manner, be sustained, and be developed more and more consolidated, and achieve the greatest results.

5. It is hoped that local branches will report to us on relevant activities to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country, and establish regular contact. The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression is temporarily located at No. 2 Yuheqiao, Beijing.

　　中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会号召
    普及与深入抗美思想教育
    统一成立委员会的各地方分会吸收广大爱国民主人士参加
    把群众的爱国热情正确地和有计划地引导到实际工作中去
    【新华社二十二日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会，向该会各地分会及保卫世界和平委员会和反对美国侵略委员会发出通告。全文如下：
    美国帝国主义在朝鲜发动了侵略战争，并对我国进行了日益凶暴的挑衅和侵略，严重地威胁着中国的安全。全中国各阶层的爱国人民，为了保卫祖国，支援朝鲜人民，保卫世界和平，已经热烈地展开了抗美援朝保家卫国的运动。这一运动是完全合理的，正义的。中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会的当前任务，就是支持和领导全国各地爱国人民的抗美援朝保家卫国运动，并且广泛地开展反对美国侵略的思想教育，使之普及和深入。兹就本会目前所要进行的工作，向各地分会及保卫世界和平委员会和反对美国侵略委员会通告如下：
    一、中国人民抗美援朝保家卫国运动是一个广泛的群众性的运动。这一运动应当在全国各地各阶层广大人民群众当中广泛展开。望联络当地各民主党派，各人民团体，各工厂、学校、机关、部队及广大人民群众当中的爱国先进分子，向广大群众进行宣传工作，以普及抗美援朝保家卫国的时事政治教育，推广仇视、鄙视和蔑视美国侵略者的运动，以唤起全国各阶层人民对于美国侵略者的同仇敌忾，扫除美国帝国主义残存在中国一部分人中间的有害影响。
    二、保卫世界和平和反对美国侵略，实质上是一件事情的不可分割的两个方面。为了更有效地开展中国人民的抗美援朝保家卫国运动，各地保卫世界和平委员会或反对美国侵略委员会尚未改组者，应即分别合并或改组，统一成立中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会的地方分会。凡原来没有上述组织的大行政区、省、市，应即成立中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会的分会。各地分会的组成单位，应吸收各民主党派、各人民团体及其他无党派爱国民主人士的代表人物参加。
    三、在各地保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会的地方分会之下，一般不再成立工厂、学校等基层组织性质的分会。各地抗美援朝运动的开展，可由各地分会推动当地各人民团体和各界人士进行工作，并通过他们向广大无组织群众进行宣传，有计划地领导人民进行各项抗美援朝保家卫国的志愿活动。
    四、抗美援朝保家卫国运动是一个比较长期性的爱国运动。中国人民在开展这一运动当中，除掉进行时事政治教育、有关国防教育和必要的志愿行动以外，应该把群众的爱国热情正确地引导到实际工作中去，使抗美援朝保家卫国的运动，和坚持自己岗位的任务相结合。因为只有这样，方能化热情为力量，更有效地做好我们的工作，方能在有计划有步骤的统一领导下，使中国人民在志愿基础上的抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大爱国运动，能够持久，能够日益巩固地发展，获得最大的成效。
    五、望各地分会将有关抗美援朝保家卫国的活动报告我们，并建立经常联系。中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会暂以北京御河桥二号为办公地址。
