　　Baotou and Datong Christians Respond to Reformation Manifesto
    Oppose American Imperialist Aggression
    [This newspaper's dispatch] After the manifesto entitled "The Path of Effort for Chinese Christianity in the Construction of New China," signed by many prominent figures in Chinese Christianity, was published, it received the enthusiastic support and welcome of the vast majority of patriotic Christians and people from all walks of life across the country. Six hundred and seventy Christians in Baotou have unanimously signed to respond to this manifesto, supporting the Christian Reformation Movement. The signed letter is recorded as follows:
    Our national church leaders, after a long period of exploration and effort, have pointed out "The Path of Effort for Chinese Christianity in the Construction of New China," raising our vigilance against imperialism, preventing exploitation by imperialists, and striving to establish an indigenous church that is self-governing, self-supporting, and self-propagating. All six hundred and seventy believers in Baotou have unanimously signed in response, resolutely support world peace, oppose American imperialist wars of aggression, and, under the leadership of the People's Government, strive to build our independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous New China.
