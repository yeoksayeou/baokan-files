　　The Victory of the Soviet October Revolution Gave All the People of the World Today
　　Zhao Guoyou
    As the anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution approached, I lay on a soft bed with white sheets in the Third Machine Factory's amateur sanatorium, remembering the strength of the peaceful and democratic camp led by the Soviet Union, which I had witnessed in person during my trip to the Soviet Union in April.

            What I Saw on May Day
    On April 30th, I didn't go to bed until after 2:00 AM in order to celebrate May Day.
    Although I only slept for a few hours, we got up on time the next morning at 6:30 AM, waiting to participate in the May Day celebration. At 8:30 AM, we walked towards Red Square in formation, saying that we would definitely see the world's human mentor, Marshal Stalin. When we were close to the rostrum, two comrades, a man and a woman, were filming our delegation with a movie camera. We found our places, and our eyes were simply too busy: more than 300 large bands and the navy, army, and air force, mechanized units, and paratrooper units marched towards Red Square in formation. At around 10:00 AM, the bands played together, and the review began soon after: first the navy, army, and air force, with eighty lines of troops marching forward. At this time, countless movie cameras and cameras were filming from upstairs and downstairs. From this neat and majestic troop, the greatness of the Soviet socialist country and the strength of the world's peace forces were fully demonstrated. In the parade, there were weapons that we had never seen before and couldn't even name. Tanks were equipped with mountain guns and anti-aircraft guns. Mechanized units were riding electric donkeys (motorcycles) and sitting in cars. There were all kinds of cannons, including the thick and long ones that had destroyed German fascists. The cannons were clearly marked, with white lines indicating how many battles they had won. All the cannons in the parade were marked with white lines all over their bodies. Following closely were twelve-barreled rocket launchers, walking as neatly as people in a queue. Everyone in the audience watched it solemnly and cheerfully, their faces showing a majestic and strong red glow. In the air, the first to pass over Red Square were large fighters with four engines, lined up in formation. The most exciting thing was the supersonic aircraft: this type of aircraft was faster than the speed of sound, and you could only hear the sound after it had flown past. Its shape was like a small swallow, with its wings bent backwards. Just as we were looking up and down, we suddenly heard that Marshal Stalin had arrived! At this time, everyone in the audience disregarded everything, crowding, jumping, stretching their necks, and standing on tiptoe to see, all preparing to shake hands, and the cheers continued for a long time. At this time, we were too anxious to get close enough to shake hands and talk. Lao Wang snatched Lao Chen's glasses and combined them with his own to use as binoculars. Looking through our newly created binoculars, we saw that Stalin was strong and robust, with a rosy face and a smile. The representatives from thirty or so countries who were standing with us on the same rostrum were as anxious as we were to see him. This truly proved that the thoughts of peace-loving people all over the world are consistent. After a little over an hour, the troops finished passing by, and the white children with red scarves walked by in formation. This was the Young Pioneers team, followed by students and workers, an endless stream of people. The teams carried all kinds of flags and models of lathes, trains, automobiles, smelting furnaces, motors, and various other things. The most interesting thing was the bread-making factory, carrying a large model of bread at the front of the team. There were also portraits of leaders from various countries, including our Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou. The large teams constantly shouted slogans. When the team walked in front of the Chinese delegation, they waved their flags, raised flowers, clapped their hands, and shouted. Many people left the team and waved to us. What moved us the most was that five- or six-year-old children also rode on their fathers' shoulders and shouted slogans such as "Long live Mao Zedong!" We stood there waving all the time: our right hands ached from waving, so we waved with our left hands. As we were rejoicing and cheering, another female comrade ran over with a movie camera to film us. In this way, we kept our eyes fixed on the large team of about three million people until they had all passed by, which took a full seven and a half hours. The Soviet people's love for us is indescribable. Even five-year-old children in the Soviet Union know how to shout "Long live Chairman Mao!" This truly demonstrates the Soviet people's spirit of internationalism and also demonstrates the unbreakable deep friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. I participated in this May Day rally and saw the large number of people in the peaceful and democratic camp and the strength of their forces, which gave me unparalleled strength.

            The Life of the Soviet Working People
    Before I went to the Soviet Union, I still didn't quite believe in my own strength and didn't believe in the good life of the Soviet people. I was still thinking about the lives of Soviet workers when I was sitting on the plane from Beijing. When I was about to arrive in Moscow, I found it very strange: there were very few people on the streets during the day, but after 7:00 or 8:00 PM, there were as many people on the streets as in a parade. Pairs of men and women walked arm in arm, talking and laughing. The men all wore suits, and the women all had permed hair, wore high-heeled leather shoes, and had powder on their faces. From a distance, you could smell the fragrance. I asked myself: What do they all do? I asked Lao Chen, who had been to the Soviet Union before, and he said: Don't look at how beautifully they are dressed, they are all workers! The lives of Soviet workers are indeed too good. There are cars all over the streets, many of which belong to the workers themselves. The underground railway that workers use to go to work was not even used by the Tsars in the past. The underground tunnels are so deep and so long, divided into three layers, with stations everywhere. From the upper layer to the lower layer, there are elevators that take you there in a few minutes. The buildings inside, the ground, the walls, and the round pillars that are so thick and so high are all made of marble. The walls are carved with the various deeds of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The streetcars come every three minutes on average. Everywhere we visited, we could see the happy lives of Soviet workers. For example, when we went to the theater, the Moscow Grand Theatre had five floors, and every day we went, we saw that it was packed with people. We saw the Moscow stadium that could hold over ten thousand people, and on the day of the ball game, even the corridors were full of people. Many people couldn't squeeze in and were sticking their heads in from the outside to watch. Culture palaces and parks were all like this.

    What I admired most in the Soviet Union was the Soviet working people's spirit of learning. Our Chinese delegation visited the Kirov Culture Palace in Leningrad, and it was not only packed inside, but there were also many people sitting outside reading books. This culture palace is very large, with poetry groups, opera groups, music groups, sports groups, dance groups, cinemas, theaters, technical research laboratories, etc. In the children's department alone, there are music teams, piano classes, shipbuilding classes, airplane building classes, train research, various crane research, botanical rooms (studying Michurin plants), children's libraries, astronomy and geography research rooms, radio research rooms, photography research rooms, children's cinemas, and other departments. There are many films here that are specially made for children to explain history and geography.

            The Soviet Government Cares About Factory Safety Work
    The Soviet government's care for the working people is meticulous. The factory's safety equipment is very thorough. Each factory has charts, and new employees must first look at the charts and understand the machine process before they can officially enter the workplace. Newly opened factories cannot start work if the equipment is not complete and has not been approved and stamped by the Minister of Labor Protection. We visited a research institute in Leningrad, where 150 experts were concentrated, specializing in the study of labor protection work. According to the comrade in charge of this research institute, the Soviet government allocated 5 billion rubles for research funding in the first five-year plan after the war. In the past fifteen years, they have researched more than 1,000 labor protection methods, reducing the injury rate of workers in various factories by three times compared to before the war. In this research institute alone, there are eleven research rooms for technical safety, electrical safety, production discipline, protection, noise reduction, physical chemistry, ventilation equipment, weather and climate, dust reduction, lighting, and technical assistance.

            Visiting Soviet Factories
    I feel that the happy lives of Soviet workers are the result of decades of hard struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This is also proven by their work. On May 10th, our Chinese delegation went to visit the Leningrad Leather Shoe Factory. The factory director introduced the history of the factory to us: before the war, this factory had more than 11,000 workers producing. During the war, the factory suffered the most brutal destruction by the German fascist army. At that time, the factory was only fifteen kilometers away from the front line, and bombs and shells fell on the workshops one after another. There was not a single intact workshop in the entire factory. At that time, only 200 workers were left in the factory to persist in working amidst the bombing, while the rest of the workers changed careers, some voluntarily and bravely taking up guns and going to the front line to kill the enemy. Their lives were extremely difficult, and they could only eat half a loaf of bread per person per day, and sometimes even went hungry.

    But even in such difficult days, the workers still persisted in working. They not only engaged in mutual assistance, but also engaged in socialist production competitions. The factory director told us: The Stalingrad Tank Factory, during the war, the enemy had already reached the factory gate, but the workers were still producing tanks in the factory, and at the same time, the workers themselves drove out the tanks and repelled the enemy. At that time, a socialist production competition was launched throughout the country. The factory director pointed to two flags on the wall and said: "These are the flags that were won at that time." Speaking of this, the factory director took out a photo album and showed it to us. These photos were all of the factory being destroyed during the war. We gathered together, flipping through them page by page. Some comrades counted more than thirty places where bombs had fallen and started fires, and some comrades kept saying: "That's really tough!" After looking at these photos, we could see more clearly how the Soviet workers and brothers fought against the fascist bandits. After introducing the previous situation of the factory, the factory director asked us again: "Do you have any other questions?" We unanimously proposed that the factory director introduce the current situation of the factory. The factory director said happily: "Let's go and visit it now, and you will know the current situation after you have seen it!" We first visited the Rationalization Proposal Research Office. Here, the technicians pointed to various materials and finished products and introduced to us: "After the workers put forward rationalization proposals, they and the technicians will study them in the research office. After the research is successful, a small booklet will be printed immediately and promoted throughout the country. For example, a female worker in our factory who cuts materials has researched a method that can save materials for 11,000 pairs of shoes per month. The state will award her 50% of the value of the materials she saves as a bonus, and now the entire factory is universally following her method." The technicians carefully explained the achievement chart of the rationalization proposal to us, and we became more and more envious as we listened. We walked to the mechanized production workshop. As soon as we entered the room, we saw shoes on the machines and on the conveyor belts, from this end to that end, from the bottom to the top, with workers working nervously beside various machines. The technicians introduced to us: "The finished product comes out from this end to that end. The entire factory produces 50,000 pairs of leather shoes per day, with an average of twelve pairs of shoes per person." When we walked to the workshop built after the factory was restored, the large lighting lamps were already waiting for us there, filming like in a play. Finally, the factory director also led us to visit the radio station, broadcast room, sanatorium, convalescent home, cafeteria, and club. What we envied was the command platform for mechanized factory management. When we walked into this room, everyone thought it was a large typewriter or a radio station, but after translation, we learned that it was the command platform for managing the factory. It can directly contact all parts of the site, so that everything on the site can be understood immediately. The commander comrade gave us a trial, pressing a number, and a workshop spoke to him. He tried it several times for us and said: "This can save a lot of running around time, and everything can be resolved in a timely manner."

            The Victory of the Chinese People is Inseparable from Soviet Aid.
    The Soviet people not only have this spirit of loving their country and achieving great revolutionary victories, but also have a high degree of internationalism.
    The people of Northeast China have freed themselves from the fourteen years of slave life under Japanese imperialism, defeated the blockade and bombing of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and established a people's government. The people have become the masters of the country, and the first unified situation has appeared on the Chinese mainland. The inflation that has lasted for more than ten years has been stopped, and the national financial and economic situation has begun to improve. The old liberated areas have completed land reform and will gradually carry out land reform in the newly liberated areas with a population of 300 million, and the poor peasants will also obtain the land they need. The country's industry is recovering. Our motherland is booming, and the people's lives are gradually improving. Take our Machine Factory Three as an example. In the first two years, when we arrived in Tiexi, we could see that the factory buildings were badly damaged. Either the roof was missing, or the windows were missing doors, and there were several broken machines, also missing arms and legs. Parts were thrown everywhere, and the tall chimneys were not emitting any smoke. Now, we are actively working for the motherland every day on the machines we make ourselves and the machines shipped from the Soviet Union thousands of miles away. The factory buildings that have not been used for many years have been built up and put into operation. The workers themselves have cooperatives, free clinics, and amateur sanatoriums. There are newly built five-story buildings for workers to use as single and family dormitories. These fruits were produced after the Soviet people, who had won the victory of the October Revolution, sent their Red Army on August 15th to liberate Northeast China and eliminate Japanese imperialism. They are inseparable from the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and the specific help of countless experts in China's recovery and construction.

            The Working Class Unite, Step Up Production, and Defeat American Imperialist Aggression.
    Just when the working class of the whole world is united and moving forward vigorously for the peaceful construction of the motherland, the American imperialists are not allowing us to recover and build, not allowing us to live a good life, and have launched a bloody war of aggression, wanting to destroy and hinder us, and not allowing us to move forward to a happy life! We firmly believe that all the conspiracies and all the atrocities of the American imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits will never stop us from moving towards a better life. Today, the American imperialists are expanding the war of aggression in Korea, wanting to burn the flames of war on us. Comrades, I can no longer tolerate it. We must take out invincible strength to crush it. The Chinese people have always loved peace, but they are even more unafraid of resisting wars of aggression. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the Chinese people have always opposed imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The Chinese people have eliminated the ferocious enemy, Japanese fascism, and the traitor Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Today, the Chinese people's struggle is by no means isolated. We not only have the support of the powerful people of our motherland and the heroic People's Liberation Army, but also the support of the people of the peaceful and democratic countries led by the Soviet Union all over the world. Premier Zhou said on the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China: "People can see that in the battle to liberate Taiwan, our strategic position is far superior to any enemy; we are standing on the sacred side of justice; our rear is so close, so large, and so consolidated; we are redoubling our efforts to achieve this final victory." Taiwan will inevitably be liberated, and this is completely certain. We can get proof from all aspects that victory belongs to the people. Therefore, we must work even harder. The working class must unite, persist in production, improve the quality and quantity of production, turn our factories into battlefields, turn our machines into weapons, resolutely fight against the enemy, fight against the enemy's planes, and fight against hidden enemies! Learn from the Soviet workers' spirit of loving their motherland and fighting against the enemy. Launch a patriotic anti-American production competition movement, defend the motherland, defend the frontier, and support the Korean People's Army with all our strength! Do a good job together, make the competition more in-depth and more extensive, and use this action to commemorate the festival of the liberation of all mankind.

　　有苏联十月革命的胜利才有全世界人民的今天
　　赵国有
    当苏联十月革命节纪念日到来的前夕，我躺在第三机器厂业余休养所有着白布单子的软床上想起来，四月间我到苏联亲眼看见的以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量。
            “五一”节所见
    四月三十号，为了庆祝“五一”，晚上两点多钟方才睡觉。
    虽然只睡了几个钟点，但是第二天早上六时三十分我们又准时起来，等着参加“五一”盛典。八时三十分，我们排着队伍往红场一边走一边说着，我们都说，一定会见到世界人类导师斯大林大元帅。快到主席台的时候，有两个男女同志拿着电影机对着我们代表团拍电影。我们找到了自己的位置，眼睛简直忙不过来：三百多名大乐队及海、陆、空军，机械化部队，降落伞部队，排成方块向红场走来。到十点多钟，乐队一齐凑乐，不久就开始检阅：首先海陆空军，八十行的队伍往前行进，这时候无数电影机照像机在楼上楼下开拍，从这整齐雄壮的队伍中，充分表现出苏联社会主义国家的伟大及世界和平力量的强大。在游行的队伍中，有着我们从未见过也叫不出名字的武器，坦克车上装置着山炮和高射炮。机械化部队都骑着电驴子（摩托车）和坐着汽车。大炮各种各样都有，其中又粗又长的大炮，曾消灭过德国法西斯，炮上标志得很清楚，打几次胜仗就有几个白道，游行中所有的炮都标志着满身白道。紧连着就是十二发的火箭炮，走起来就像人排队一样齐。全场的人都庄严愉快的看着它，脸上都露出雄伟强壮的红光。空中的飞机，首先是四个发动机的大战斗机，排着队由红场上面穿过。最令人兴奋的是超音速飞机：这种飞机的速度比声音快，飞过去方能听到声音，它的形状就像小燕子样，翅膀往后边弯着。我们正在上下看的时候，忽然听说斯大林大元帅来啦！这时全场的人不顾一切，拥挤跳动，伸长脖子，跷起脚看，都准备握手的样子，欢呼声很久不断。在这时我们凑不到跟前握手说话，很着急。老王把老陈的眼镜抢过来和他的眼镜合在一起当望远镜使用，我们用新创造的望远镜一看，斯大林身魁力壮，脸面红润露着笑容。和我们站在一个主席台上的三十来个的国家代表团们，都和我们有着同样的心情在着急看不到。这真正证明了全世界爱好和平人民思想是一致的。经过一点多钟的光景，军队过完，白娃娃缚着红领巾的队形走来，这是少年儿童队，后边跟的学生工人，一眼望不到头的大队伍。队伍里打着各种各样的旗子和车床子、火车、汽车、化铁炉电机和各种各样不同的模型，最有趣的是作面包的工厂，在队前扛着大面包的模型，还有各国的领袖像，其中有咱毛主席，刘少奇副主席，周总理三个人的大像。大队不断的高呼口号，当队伍走到中国代表团前面时，他们就摇起旗子，举起花，拍手，高呼，有很多人离开队伍，给我们招手。使我们最受感动的，是五六岁的小孩也骑在他爹爹头上向我们高呼“毛泽东万岁”等口号，我们站在那里一直挥手：右手挥痛啦，再挥左手。我们正在欢腾鼓舞之中，又跑过来一个女同志拿着电影机向我们照。就这样，我们一直瞪着眼睛看着三百万左右人的大队伍过完，时间整七个半小时。苏联人民对我们的热爱是难以形容的，在苏联五岁小孩都知道喊“毛主席万岁”，这真是表现苏联人民国际主义的精神，也表现中、苏两国人民不可摧毁的深厚友谊。我参加了这个“五一”大会，见到了和平民主阵营人民的众多，力量的壮大，给我增加了无比的力量。
            苏联劳动人民的生活
    我在未去苏联以前，总还不大相信自己的力量，不相信苏联人民的美好生活。我从北京坐在飞机上还想着苏联工人的生活。我将到莫斯科的时候，觉得很奇怪：白天街上人很少，一到下午七、八点钟以后，街上的人就像游行队伍一样多。一对一对的男女，挎着胳膊，连说带笑的走着。男的都穿着西装，女的都烫着卷发，穿着高跟皮鞋，脸上还抹着粉，离着很远就觉得香气扑鼻。我心里自问着：他们都是干什么的？我问曾去过苏联的老陈，他说：别看穿的那样漂亮，他们都是工人哪！苏联工人的生活的确太好了，满街的汽车，很多是工人自己的。工人上班用的地下铁道，过去沙皇都没有用过。地下道那么深那么长，分为三层，到处都是车站，由上层到下层都是电梯，几分钟就到。里面的建筑、地皮、墙、那么粗那么高的圆柱子，完全是大理石筑成的，墙皮上雕刻着工农兵的各种事迹，电车平均三分钟就来一趟。在我们参观过的地方，到处可以看到苏联工人的幸福生活。比方看戏吧，莫斯科大戏院有五层楼，我们每天去的时候，都看到人挤得满满的。我们看到莫斯科能容十几万人的大球场，在赛球那天，连走廊都站满了人，有很多人挤不进去，就在外边伸着头往里看。文化宫、公园到处都是这样。
    在苏联使我最羡慕的，是苏联劳动人民的学习精神。我们中国代表团在列宁格勒参观基洛夫文化宫，里面挤满人还不算，外面也坐着许多人在看书。这个文化宫规模很大，里面有诗歌组、歌剧组、音乐组、体育组、跳舞组、电影院、剧院、技术研究室等。单在儿童部下面，就又分音乐队、钢琴班、造船班、造飞机班、火车研究、各种起重机研究、植物室（研究米邱林植物）、儿童图书馆、天文地理研究室、无线电研究室、照像研究室、小孩电影院等部门。这里有很多的电影片子，是专供给小孩子们讲解历史、地理用的。
            苏联政府关心工厂保安工作
    苏联政府对劳动人民的关心，是无微不至的。工厂的安全设备非常周到。每个工厂都有图表，新来厂工作的，必须先让他们看图表明白机器过程以后，才正式入场工作。新开办的工厂，如果设备不完善，不经劳保部长批准盖章，就不能开工。我们在列宁格勒参观了一个研究院，这里集中了一百五十个专家们，专门在研究劳动保护工作。据这个研究院的负责同志说：苏联政府在战后第一个五年计划中，就拿出了五十亿卢布作研究经费，他们在十五年当中，已经研究出一千多种劳保方法，使各工厂的职工的受伤率，比战前降低了三倍。光在这个研究院里，就有技术安全、电力安全、生产纪律、防护、减少声音、物理化学、通风设备、天气与气候、减少灰尘、照明、技术帮助等十一个研究室。
            参观苏联工厂
    我觉得苏联工人的幸福生活，是劳动者们在联共党领导下，经过数十年艰难困苦当中斗争得来的。从他们工作当中也证明了这点。五月十日，我们中国代表团去参观列宁格勒皮鞋工厂。厂长给我们介绍这个工厂的历史：在战前，这工厂有一万一千多工人生产；在大战中，工厂遭受了德国法西斯军队最残酷的破坏。当时，工厂离前线只有十五公里，炸弹和炮弹纷纷落到各车间，全车间没有一个完整的。那时候，全厂只留下了二百名工人在炮火轰炸中坚持工作，其余的工人转业，有的自动地勇敢地拿起枪杆子到前线去杀敌人。他们的生活困难万分，差不多每天每人只可吃到半个面包，有时甚至饿肚子。
    但就在这样艰苦的日子里，工人们也仍然坚持着工作。他们不但搞互助，而且还搞社会主义生产竞赛。厂长对我们说：斯大林格勒坦克工厂，在战争时，敌人都打到工厂大门口了，工人们却还在工厂里生产坦克车，同时工人自己动手开出坦克击退了敌人。当时在全国掀起了社会主义生产竞赛。厂长指着墙上两面旗子说：“这就是那时得的旗。”说到这里，厂长拿出一本照片给我们看。这些照片全是在战争中工厂被破坏的情况。我们聚在一起，一页一页翻着，有的同志数着炸弹落下来起火的有三十多处，有的同志不住地说着：“真够呛！”看了这些照片，使我们更清楚地看到了苏联工人弟兄是怎样对法西斯匪帮们进行斗争的。把工厂以前情况介绍完以后，厂长又问我们：“你们还有什么问题吗？”我们一致提出，请厂长介绍一下现在工厂情况。厂长高兴地说：“我们现在就去参观一下吧，你们看过以后就知道现在的情况啦！”我们首先参观合理化建议研究室。在这里，技师指着各种各样的材料和成品给我们介绍说：“工人提出合理化建议后，就和技术人员在研究室研究，研究成功后，即时印出小册子，推广全国。比如本厂有一位下材料的女工，他研究出一个方法，每月能省一万一千双鞋的料子。国家按她省下料子的价值，提出百分之五十的奖金奖励她，现在全厂都普遍照着她的办法施行。”技师仔细地给我们解释合理化建议的成绩表，我们越听越羡慕。走到机械化生产车间。一进屋，就看见鞋子在机器上、轮带上、从这头到那头、从下面到上面，工作人员在各种不同的机器旁，紧张地工作着。技师给我们介绍说：“从这头到那头成品就出来了。全厂日产五万双皮鞋，平均每人生产十二双鞋。”我们走到工厂恢复后建筑的车间时，大照明灯也早就在那里等着我们，就像演戏一样拍电影。最后，厂长又引着我们参观了无线电台、广播室、疗养所、休养院、食堂、俱乐部。使我们羡慕的还有机械化管理工厂的司令台。当我们走进这个屋里的时候，大家都以为是大型打字机或是电台，经翻译后才知道是管理工厂的司令台。它直接能和现场各处取得联系，使现场一切情况能立时被了解。司令员同志给我们试验一下，他一按号码，就有一个车间和他说话，连着试好几次给我们看，他说：“这可以省很多跑腿时间，一切事情能及时得到解决。”
            中国人民的胜利，和苏联的援助分不开。
    苏联人民不仅有这样热爱祖国取得伟大革命胜利的精神，而且也有高度的国际主义精神。
    东北人民摆脱日本帝国主义十四年的奴隶生活，战胜了帝国主义及国民党反动派的封锁轰炸，建立了人民政府，人民成为国家主人，中国大陆上出现第一次统一的局面；停止了十多年来的通货膨胀，国家财政经济状况开始好转，老解放区已完成了土地改革，并将逐步在三万万人口的新解放区进行土地改革，贫苦的农民，也将获得他们所需要的土地；全国的工业正在恢复；我们祖国正在蓬勃前进，人民的生活逐步提高。就拿我们机器三厂来说吧，头二年一到铁西就可以看到，工厂场房破坏不堪，不是缺少房顶，就是缺窗户无门，有几台破机器，也是缺胳膊少腿，到处都扔着零件，大高的烟筒一点烟也不冒。现在，我们每天都在亲手制造出来的机器和由几千里外苏联运来的机器上，为祖国积极工作着，把数年来不用的场房都建设起来开了工。工人自己有了合作社、免费的医务所、业余休养所，有新建筑的五层大楼给工人作独身和家属宿舍。这些果实，是由十月革命节胜利了的苏联人民，他们在“八一五”派出自己的红军，解放东北，消灭了日本帝国主义以后才出现的，是和建立中苏友好同盟互助条约、无数专家在中国恢复建设当中具体的帮助分不开的。
            工人阶级团结起来，加紧生产，打垮美帝侵略。
    正当全世界工人阶级大团结，为祖国和平建设，朝气蓬勃地前进着的时候，美帝竟不让我们恢复建设，不让我们过好日子，发动了血腥的侵略战争，想破坏和阻碍我们，不让我们向美满生活前进！我们坚信，美帝与蒋匪帮的一切阴谋，一切暴行，决阻挡不了我们走向美好的生活。今天美帝正在朝鲜扩大侵略战争，想把战火燃烧到我们身上来，同志们，我再不能容忍了，一定拿出无敌的力量去粉碎它。中国人民从来是爱好和平的，但是更不怕反抗侵略的战争。中国人民在毛主席共产党领导下，从来就是反对帝国主义及蒋介石匪帮的。中国人民曾消灭了凶恶敌人日本法西斯及卖国贼蒋介石匪帮。今天中国人民的斗争决不是孤立无援的，我们不但有强大的祖国人民和英勇的人民解放军，而且还有全世界以苏联为首的和平民主国家的人民的支持。周总理在中华人民共和国成立一周年时说：“人们可以看出：在解放台湾的作战中，我们的战略地位是比任何敌人要优越得多；我们是站在神圣的正义方面；我们的后方是这样近，这样大，这样巩固；我们正为取得这个最后胜利而在加倍努力。”台湾必然要解放，这是完全肯定了的。我们从各方面都可得到证明，胜利是属于人民的。因此我们更要加倍努力。工人阶级团结起来，坚持生产，提高生产质量和产量，把我们的工场变成战场，把机器变成武器，坚决和敌人作斗争，和敌人飞机作斗争，和暗藏的敌人作斗争！学习苏联工人爱祖国、和敌人作斗争的精神。展开爱国主义反美生产竞赛运动，保卫祖国，保卫边疆，以一切力量支援朝鲜人民军！共同把工作作好，使竞赛更深入、更广泛，用这个行动来纪念全世界人类解放的节日。
