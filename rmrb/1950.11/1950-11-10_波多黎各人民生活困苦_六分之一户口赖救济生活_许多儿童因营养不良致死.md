　　Puerto Rican People Live in Poverty
    One-Sixth of Households Depend on Relief
    Many Children Die from Malnutrition
    [Xinhua News Agency, New York, 5th] TASS dispatch from New York, 5th: President Truman recently discussed the situation in Puerto Rico at a press conference. He declared that the people of Puerto Rico were "satisfied and delighted" with the "constitution" passed by the US Congress, and insisted that the people of Puerto Rico "are free to choose their own form of government."

    Whether the people of Puerto Rico are satisfied with their fate has been proven by the anti-American uprising on the island, which is being brutally suppressed by the police. On the other hand, the US Interdepartmental Committee's report on the situation of children and adolescents, published on November 3rd, not only exposed the tragic situation of Puerto Rican youth but also depicted the terrible poverty, malnutrition, and housing difficulties of the entire population.

    According to the report's statistics, in 1949, 33,000 households, or one-sixth of all households on the island, were living on government relief, and another 41,000 households had applied for such relief.

    The housing situation of the Puerto Rican people is also very miserable. In 1947, more than 84,000 households were crammed into unsanitary slums, with the number of residents in these slums increasing by about 2,000 households each year.

    Many children die from malnutrition; in general, the infant mortality rate in Puerto Rico is extremely high. The report pointed out, "In terms of physical development, Puerto Rican children are always two years behind American children."

    The following figures illustrate the situation of medical services: In 1947, there was only one doctor for every 2,500 residents in Puerto Rico, and only one nurse for every 876 people.

    Education is in a very pitiful state. In 1940, almost one-third of the total population was illiterate. In 1946, 28.3 percent of children aged ten and over could not read or write. The funding for national schools, calculated per capita of the entire national income, is only one-third of that of American schools.

    The report also pointed out that due to the poverty of the people, child labor is widely employed.

### 波多黎各人民生活困苦  六分之一户口赖救济生活  许多儿童因营养不良致死

　　波多黎各人民生活困苦
    六分之一户口赖救济生活
    许多儿童因营养不良致死
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约五日电：杜鲁门总统最近在记者招待会上谈到波多黎各的状况。他宣称，波多黎各人民对于美国国会所通过的“宪法”是感到“满意与欣愉”的，并且硬说波多黎各人民“能够自由选择他们自己的政府形式”。
    波多黎各人民是否满意于他们的命运，已由该岛上的反美起义所证明，这次起义正遭到警察的野蛮镇压；另一方面，美国部际委员会于十一月三日发表的关于儿童与少年的境况的报告不但暴露了波多黎各青年的悲惨境况，并且描绘出全体居民的可怕的贫困、营养不良，以及住屋的困难情况。
    根据该报告的统计，在一九四九年，有三万三千户，即该岛全部户口的六分之一，是依靠政府救济生活的，另有四万一千户已申请这种救济。
    波多黎各人民的住屋情况也是很凄惨的。在一九四七年，八万四千多户挤在不卫生的贫民窟中；这些贫民窟中的居民每年约增加二千多户。
    许多儿童因营养不良致死；一般的说波多黎各的婴孩死亡率是极高的。报告指出，“就儿童们的体格发育来说，波多黎各儿童总是比美国儿童落后两年”。
    下列数字说明了医疗服务的情况：在一九四七年，波多黎各每二千五百名居民只有一个医生，每八百七十六人中只有一个看护。
    教育处在十分可怜的状况之中。在一九四○年，全人口几乎有三分之一是文盲。在一九四六年，十岁和十岁以上的儿童有百分之二十八点三不能读书写字。国立学校的经费按全体国民每人平均所得计算只及美国学校的三分之一。
    报告并且指出，由于人民贫困，普遍雇用童工。
