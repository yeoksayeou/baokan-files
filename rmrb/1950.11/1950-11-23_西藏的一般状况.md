The General Situation of Tibet
	Liu Guanyi

	Tibet is located in southwestern China, about 13,000 li from Beijing. The entire area of Tibet is 900,500 square kilometers (some say over 1.2 million square kilometers), spanning about 2,600 kilometers from east to west and about 1,200 kilometers from north to south. It is roughly equal to the combined area of Germany and France, second only to Xinjiang in China, ranking second in the country. Its northern border is Xinjiang, its northeastern border is Qinghai, its eastern border is Xikang, its southeastern border is Yunnan, and its southwestern borders are India and Burma, with the small countries of Bhutan, Nepal, and Sikkim (i.e., Zhe Mengxiong) in between. On this plateau live 3,722,000 Tibetans and several other small ethnic groups. With such a vast area inhabited by only over 3.7 million people, it is naturally sparsely populated, with only four people per square kilometer.

	The Topography of Tibet

	Tibet is a plateau, and a famous one in the world. Its average altitude is over 5,000 meters, so it is called the "Roof of the World." Only the Yarlung Tsangpo River basin in the south forms a narrow river valley, which is the most densely populated and resource-rich area in Tibet. The mountains are extremely high and steep. The Kunlun Mountains stretch across the north, and the Tanggula Mountains, the southern branch of the Kunlun Mountains, meander between Qinghai and Xikang. The Gangdise Mountains are north of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, and the Himalayas wind along the borders of India, Tibet, Nepal, and Bhutan, serving as a barrier for southwestern China. Its main peak, Mount Everest, is 8,840 meters high, the highest peak in the world.

	The main river is the Yarlung Tsangpo River in the south, with its source being the Maquan River, which originates from the Gangdise Mountains. It runs horizontally through the valleys between the Himalayas and the Outer Himalayas, flowing eastward to meet the Laqazangbu River, Lhasa River, etc., and entering Xikang, with a total river length of 1,800 li. The next is the Indus River in the west, with its source being the Shiquan River, Xiangquan River, Lang River, etc., all originating from the western foothills of the Gangdise Mountains. It enters India and merges into the Indus River, which flows into the Arabian Sea. There are many lakes and marshes on the plateau, especially in the central part, with Tengger Lake, Bukachi, Qilin Lake, Pangong Lake, Zhaling Lake, and Manasarovar Lake being the largest. Tengger Lake and Manasarovar Lake are both revered as "sacred places" by Tibetans. The largest Tengger Lake is 950 kilometers. In addition, there are hundreds of freshwater lakes and salt lakes in Changtang. The salt lakes are covered with many square miles of salt or alkali, and some salt lakes are simply equal to the flat ground. Along the lakes are potassium carbonate, soda, borax, etc. However, these lakes are mostly inland lakes, and the lake water cannot flow out. In summer, they become swampy areas. Even the rivers are mostly turbulent and unfavorable for navigation. Only a few hundred li of the Yarlung Tsangpo River confluence with the Lhasa River are navigable.

	The Administrative Division of Tibet

	In terms of regional division, Tibet is divided into three parts: Qiantang (Front Tibet), Houzang (Back Tibet), and Ali.

	"Lhasa" means "holy land." It was the old capital of the Tubo Kingdom in the Tang Dynasty and is now the capital of Qiantang, as well as the political, religious, cultural, industrial, and commercial center of Tibet. The city walls are located in a sheltered river valley on the north bank of the Lhasa River, surrounded by high mountains and vast plains. The climate is very mild and the soil is very fertile, so agriculture is quite developed. Vegetables, apples, peaches, and flowers can also be grown near Lhasa City. At the same time, Lhasa Avenue is well-connected in all directions, so commerce is quite prosperous. The trade is mainly in grains, livestock, and brick tea. The city has electricity, telephone, and other equipment. There are about 60,000 to 70,000 residents, of which lamas account for about 40,000 to 50,000. On the Potala Mountain in the northwest of the city is the Potala Temple, also known as the Imperial Palace, a magnificent 13-story building, which is the highest expression of Tibetan architecture and one of the most prominent buildings in the world. The Dalai Lama lives in this palace. Rikaze (also known as Tashilhunpo) is the capital of Houzang, located at the confluence of the Yarlung Tsangpo River and the Nyang Chu River, 12,000 feet above sea level. It is backed by mountains and faces water, with a majestic appearance. Commerce is also quite developed, with about 9,000 residents. Nearby are connected fertile fields, and agriculture is also quite prosperous. In the southwest is Tashilhunpo Monastery, with a circumference of three li, surrounded by city walls. Its scale is second only to the Potala Temple in Lhasa and is the residence of the former Panchen Lama. Gardak, also known as Gartok or Jiatuoke, is the capital of the Ali region, located on the upper reaches of the Indus River. It is an important city in western Tibet, very close to Kashmir and not far from the Soviet border. It can be connected to Xinjiang in the north. Under the pressure of British imperialism, it was opened as a trading port in the 30th year of Guangxu (i.e., 1904 AD) at the same time as Gyantse. Now the trade with India is very prosperous every summer, but in winter, due to the blockage of ice and snow, the commercial road is cut off.

	The Transportation of Tibet

	The transportation in Tibet is relatively backward due to its mountainous location and years of rule by feudal forces. Rivers are not navigable, and there are still no railways. Although there was an original plan for the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, it has not been surveyed yet. Therefore, transportation with the outside world relies only on the roads for animal-powered transportation. There are four main roads connecting Tibet with the outside world. One line goes north from Lhasa, crossing high mountains of nearly 20,000 feet, passing Kukunor to Huangyuan west of Lanzhou in Gansu, with a road length of 3,705 li. It takes about 50 to 60 days for the post to travel. Because there is more water and grass in summer and the weather is warm, most merchants travel in summer. One line goes east from Lhasa, passing Tai Zhao, Qamdo, Ba'an, Lihua, and Dajianlu (i.e., Kangding, the current capital of Xikang Province) to Chengdu in Sichuan. This road is slightly closer than the road from Lanzhou to Lhasa. In the past, tea was mostly transported from the mainland to Tibet, so it is called the "Tea Road." One line goes southwest from Lhasa, passing Gyantse and Yadong to Darjeeling, and then continuing to Sikkim or to Kalimpong near Darjeeling, which is the trade route from Tibet to India. It is about 330 li from Lhasa to Gangtok in India, and mail can be delivered in eight to ten days. One line goes west from Lhasa to Gardak on the upper reaches of the Indus River, and then to Leh, the capital of Ladakh, which is 900 li. The extreme west connects the mountain road between India and Xinjiang. From Srinagar, the Bozetel and Hongza mountain roads can reach Shule in Xinjiang.

	Transportation between Tibet and mainland China is so blocked and inconvenient, but the situation is the opposite from India to Tibet. The Indo-Tibetan railway built by the British in the past has been connected to Darjeeling on the Tibetan border. From Darjeeling to Yadong via Gyantse, there are cars that can go to Lhasa. The construction of this railway by British imperialists was, of course, to facilitate the invasion of Tibet through this railway.

	The Climate of Tibet

	Because Tibet is located on a plateau, about three-quarters of this million-square-kilometer area is over 10,000 feet above sea level. Therefore, the climate of Tibet is greatly influenced by its terrain and surrounding mountains. The air in the highest areas is quite thin, and at the same time, it is subject to strong solar radiation, which makes the temperature difference between day and night very large. The daily temperature difference exceeds 80 degrees, with short summers reaching 90 degrees and winters as low as minus 40 degrees. Of course, the cold in winter is mainly due to the strong winds. Not only is the temperature difference between day and night very large, but the temperature difference between regions is also very large. For example, the climate in the Yarlung Tsangpo River valley is quite mild, while the windward slopes of the Himalayas have become a subtropical climate, and the high plateau areas in the north are very cold. If we take the climate near Lhasa as the standard for the climate of Tibet, the climate of Lhasa is as follows: The area is divided into two different seasons. May to September is the rainy or growing season, and the remaining months are the cold or dry season. Spring and autumn are very short. Because the terrain confuses the wind direction, the southeast monsoon is obvious in summer, and the west wind is more common in winter, and it lasts longer. The average temperature in January is 32 degrees, the average temperature in July is 64 degrees, and the average annual temperature is 48 degrees. The temperature is highest in May before the rainy season, and there are an average of 225 days with frost a year. According to the reports of the Lhasa Meteorological Station, the average annual rainfall for the three years of 1935, 1937, and 1938 was 18 inches.

	Because each region of Tibet is located in different terrains, the climate varies greatly. Therefore, there are significant changes in production. The Yarlung Tsangpo River basin, where the climate is relatively mild, is a cultivatable area, rich in highland barley, and small amounts of barley, wheat, beans, rice, etc. are also produced. Animal husbandry is most developed in the north. In addition to cattle, sheep, horses, camels, etc., there are also special yaks and wild animals such as bears, deer, and takins in the mountains. Moreover, antelope horns, rhino horns, deer antlers, musk, etc. are famous specialties of Tibet, and the annual export volume is very large. Agriculture in Tibet is not very developed. Climate and geography are major reasons. At the same time, many Tibetans rely on nomadic life. Their main foods are meat and dairy products (just like the lives of Mongolians). This is also a reason why agriculture is not very developed. If detailed soil surveys can be carried out in the future, and water conservancy can be developed, and suitable varieties can be cultivated, agricultural production in many swampy areas still has great development prospects.

	Tibetan Industry and Commerce

	Of course, industry and commerce in Tibet are also very backward. Except for a military factory, a power plant, and a mint in Lhasa, there is no modern industry. There is only handicraft industry. The most famous handicraft products are Tibetan incense and Pulu. Wu Shengqin described it in his poem Tibetan Incense: "Sweet pine and shells, tempered into iron in a furnace, pounded into fine frost, twisted into golden pipes, a little spark comes, smoke seals rise, its smell is faint and speechless, its furnace light is shining, heavy curtains closed for a short time, melting and penetrating hundreds of holes, dispelling evil with supernatural powers, which must be counted as medical treatment." Although it is somewhat exaggerated, it is not difficult to see its preciousness. As for Pulu, it is woven with sheep wool, beautiful and strong. Tibet exports a lot of these two handicraft works every year. As for the commercial situation, Tibet exports Tibetan incense, wool, yaks, leather, medicinal materials, salt, etc., and imports fabrics, cotton yarn, tea, grains, etc. Tea is the largest import, and it has always been dominated by Chinese tea. In the past, about 13 million pounds of brick tea were transported from the mainland to Tibet every year. However, the freight cost of transporting Chinese tea from Sichuan to Tibet is too high, so it has been squeezed out by tea transported by Indian tea merchants. Among the exported goods from Tibet, wool is the largest. According to the Indian Yearbook, about 3 million to 5 million catties of wool are exported to India every year. According to Sakapa, the "Minister of Finance" of Tibet in 1948, the value of this exported wool is about 3 million to 4 million US dollars. About 22 million to 30 million tons of salt are exported every year, mostly to Bhutan and Nepal. The trade locations of Tibet to other places are Dajianlu (the trade location to Sichuan), Atuntze (the trade location to Yunnan), and Xining (the trade location to Qinghai). Foreign trade is mainly with India, and the trade locations are Yadong, Gyantse, and Gartok. These three locations are the strongholds of imperialist economic invasion of Tibet. Yadong, also known as Maotun, is the southern gateway of Tibet, located between Bhutan and Sikkim. It was opened as a trading port in the 19th year of Guangxu, only 80 li away from Darjeeling, India. Gyantse, also known as Jiyang Ze, is located southwest of Rikaze and is an important transportation hub between Tibet and India. It was opened as a trading port with Gartok in the 32nd year of Guangxu due to the "Sino-British Treaty." The opening of these foreign trade ports is very convenient for the import of foreign goods. Most of the imported goods in Tibet come from India, Nepal, Bhutan, Sikkim, and other countries. Therefore, the commercial rights of Tibet today are mostly controlled by the Indian government. This is one of the reasons why the Indian government is unwilling for us to liberate Tibet.

	The Resources of Tibet

	Although agriculture, commerce, and industry in Tibet are not very developed, the undeveloped material resources of Tibet are still quite rich. For example, Tibet has a large mineral reserve. Former Japanese Sakurayama Kihō said in his Tibetan Travelogue: "Tibet's mineral resources alone are qualified to build a railway." Among the rich mineral resources in Tibet, gold in the east is the most prominent, with large quantity and good quality. According to the mining category in Fuddle's British Army's Entry into Tibet, the ore veins in Nachang north of Lhasa are about 900 li long, so foreigners compare the amount of gold in Tibet to the second California in North America. The Lokdo area in the northwest is also rich in gold, and it is famous for its gold production. This gold-producing place is located in the upper reaches of the Indus River and is the mountain path from Xinjiang to India. Other places such as Alat Tai and Tok Zalong also produce gold. Second only to gold is lake salt. Most lakes in Tibet produce salt, especially the eleven salt ponds such as Tanggula Youmu. Lake salt is the most important raw material for Tibetans to exchange for food. The main food of Tibetans is highland barley, and the output of highland barley is less than half of the required amount, but Tibet has vast and boundless edible salt, which Tibetans can extract as much as possible and transport to Nepal and Bhutan to exchange for wheat (because Nepal and Bhutan are rich in wheat). Other minerals such as silver, copper, tin, lead, coal, pine pollen, mercury, agate, amber, whetstone, gold stone, sulfur, stone swallow, gypsum, asbestos, crystal, smoky quartz, diamond, black saltpeter alum, etc. are also everywhere. Recently, reactionary newspapers of imperialists have been constantly spreading that there is uranium in Tibetan mines that can be used to make atomic bombs. In order to slaughter mankind, imperialists will naturally pay attention to the raw materials for slaughtering mankind.

	Tibetan Culture, Education, Government, and Army

	The situation of culture, education, government, and army in Tibet: The ruling class of Tibet has used religion as a tool to rule the people for thousands of years, so it has won over the people to worship Buddhism. Therefore, the so-called education in Tibet now is Buddhism. Except for a very small number of high-ranking monks, nobles, and gentry who are proficient in Buddhism, most other people have not received education. Not only do they not know Chinese, but most of them do not even know Tibetan alphabets, so the culture is very backward. In addition to the two official Tibetan universities (i.e., what Tibetans call Zilao Zha) in Biepeng in the front Tibet and Tashilhunpo in the back Tibet, which are specially used to educate the children of the nobility, there are no fixed schools in other counties. Even if there are any, they are completely religious education and cannot be compared with modern schools. In addition, there are some private schools like those in mainland China, and some even have mixed classes of men and women, but they are not many in number and are mostly small lamas, and they mostly take Buddhist classics such as precepts, theories, six degrees, Hetu-vidya, and emptiness sutras as compulsory subjects to anesthetize the people.

	The organization of the Tibetan government: Because the characteristic of Tibetan politics is "the unity of politics and religion," the controller of the regime is the religious leader. In politics, it is completely a kind of centralization. The power of the government and the power of religion are concentrated in one person, just like the Pope of Rome in medieval Europe. The religious leader of Tibet is the Dalai, so the leader of the regime is also the Dalai. Under the Dalai, there are three "Silun" (the Silun is equivalent to the president of the Kuomintang government's parliament). Under the "Silun" is the "Kasha," which is the highest power organ of the "Tibetan government." This supreme power organ is composed of four "Kabulon" (Kabulon is equivalent to a minister or member). The candidates are customarily three secular and one monk. The four "Kabulon" organize an administrative meeting to exercise all political power in accordance with the orders of the Dalai and the "Silun." All civil and military organs under the "Kasha" are governed by officials of the fourth rank (according to the Tibetan official ranks, the Dalai is of the first rank, the "Silun" is of the second rank, the "Kabulon" is of the second rank, and the secretary-general, secretary, commander-in-chief, and Daiben "regimental commander" are of the fourth rank. Below there are fifth, sixth, and seventh-grade ranks). The "Lhasa government" of Tibet is composed of 350 monks and secular officials. The basic unit of the local administrative organization in Tibet is the "Zong" (the Zong is equivalent to the county in the mainland, and each Zong has a Zongben, which is equivalent to the county magistrate in the mainland. The Zong is divided into four types: big Zong, middle Zong, small Zong, and border Zong). All matters concerning local politics, military affairs, education, etc. are under its management. According to the 1948 Chinese Yearbook, the "Tibetan government" has a total of 123 "Zong" in its jurisdiction (some say 130 Zong or 170 Zong). Below the Zong is the township (Tibetan name unknown), which is equipped with "Queben" (some call "Gengbu"). Below the "Queben" is "Mimi" (also called "Xinben" or "Eba," equivalent to the village chief in the mainland). Below the "Mimi" is "Jiaben" (i.e., the group leader in the village). In the past, there was a dispute between the pro-Chinese and pro-British factions in the "Tibetan government." After the pro-British faction killed the pro-Chinese regent Reting in July 1947, the "Tibetan government" completely came under the control of the pro-British faction. This is one of the reasons why the "Tibetan government" opposes our army's advance into Tibet and the liberation of the Tibetan people.

	The Army of Tibet: There were no regular troops in Tibet during the Qing Dynasty. In the fifty-seventh year of Qianlong, 5,165 soldiers were allotted. After the Qing Dynasty lost its control, Tibet began to build modern troops in the early years of the Republic of China. Before 1946, the Tibetan army had a total of 13 "Daiben" of infantry, cavalry, and artillery ("Daiben" is said to be equal to a regiment, but it is actually equal to a battalion, because each "Daiben" has only 500 to 600 people), estimated to be about 8,000 people. According to the Myanmar Times in July this year, the number of regular troops in Tibet is about 12,000 people. In fact, it would not reach 12,000 people at that time. According to a Calcutta telegram recently (i.e., October 30), Tibetans traveling in India also said: "Tibet has 14 Daiben troops, with about 500 people in each Daiben, totaling 7,000 people." Another recent visit to Taiwan by the Dalai's brother, Gyalo Thondup, told Taiwanese reporters on November 4, 1950: "We only have 8,000 militia." From this, it can be judged that the formal armed forces in Tibet are only about 8,000 people. Even if it is expanded after our army advances, it will not exceed 10,000 to 12,000 people. Of course, there may be 10,000 to 20,000 reserve troops, but most of them have no guns. In addition, there are about 10,000 guns stored among the people in Tibet. According to the statistics of the puppet Ministry of National Defense in 1949, there are a total of 40 machine guns, 20 mortars, 20 field guns, 6 mountain guns, and 10 infantry guns in Tibet, with more than 30,000 rifles in stock (most of the guns are old and some are even unusable). In fact, it may be more than these numbers, because the "Tibetan delegation" in India does not deny: "Tibet has indeed purchased military supplies from India." (See Agence France-Presse, Paris, June 4, 1950, citing Indian broadcasts). The organizational system of the Tibetan military is: (1) "Makikang" - that is, the military equipment department directly under the Kasha, which is the highest military organ in Tibet, governing all the troops in Tibet. There are four "Maki" (i.e., the meaning of commander-in-chief, officials of the third rank) (only one in the past, increased to four in 1947). (2) "Dai" - equivalent to a regiment, is the highest unit in the Tibetan army's organization. Each "Dai" is equipped with two "Daiben" (equivalent to the regimental commander, officials of the fourth rank). The code name of each regiment is arranged according to the order of the thirty Tibetan alphabets. (3) "Ru" - equivalent to a battalion, equipped with one "Ruben" (equivalent to a battalion commander, an official of the fifth rank). (4) "Jia" - equivalent to a company, equipped with one "Jiaben" (equivalent to the company commander, an official of the sixth rank). (5) "Ding" - equivalent to a platoon, equipped with one "Dingben" (equivalent to the platoon leader, an official of the seventh rank). (6) "Jiu" - equivalent to a squad, equipped with one "Jiuben" (equivalent to the squad leader). The squad is the most basic unit of the troops. The training of the Tibetan army is not very good. In 1918, the "Tibetan government" established a "Zhongzha Maga" (i.e., the noble training team), which was completely presided over by people sent by British imperialists. After the death of the 13th Dalai, the "Zhongzha Maga" was discontinued, and British imperialists ran an officer training group in Gyantse to train officers on behalf of them. Many Tibetan nobles and children also went to Britain and India to study military affairs. The discipline of the Tibetan army is very bad, and it often extorts the people, but the spirit of attack is still good. As long as the attack order is issued, they will rush forward, but if they lose, they will be defeated.

	The Life of the Tibetan People

	Finally, let's talk about the life of the Tibetan people: Tibet is basically a feudal society, so the ruling class of Tibet divides the Tibetans into three classes and nine grades. There is no communication between the various grades, and the boundaries are very clear. These three classes and nine grades are: (1) Labu (upper class): Labu Kailabu is the upper-upper class, including the Dalai Regent and the Dalai's family. Labu Kai Ding (upper-middle class): Silun Galen, Gandan Chiba (Gandan Temple lecturer), and the living Buddhas of major temples, Gexi (a kind of degree for monks), etc. are included. Labu Kai Dama (upper-lower class): Secretaries, Daiben, Zongben, and ordinary lamas are included. (2) Ding (middle class): Ding Kai Labu (middle-upper class): Landlords, heroes, descendants of families, and those who can independently donate money to "help the country" are included. Ding Kai Ding (middle-middle class): Clerks, petty officials, attendants, cooks, etc. are included. Ding Kai Dama (middle-lower class): Soldiers, farmers, etc. are included. (3) Dama (lower class): Dama Labu (lower-upper class): The slaves of officials are included. Dama Ding (lower-middle class): People without fixed residences, single men and women, beggars, etc. are included. Dama Dama (lower-lower class): Butchers, cleaners, corpse collectors, goldsmiths, ironworkers, etc. are included. Although the Tibetan people are divided into three classes and nine grades, the basic opposing classes are the landlord class and the peasant class. There is no proletariat in Tibet, but with the invasion of imperialism, comprador commercial capitalists have emerged. In addition, there is a huge social parasitic group - the lamas. According to general estimates, lamas account for one-tenth to two-tenths of the total population of Tibet. (We will describe why there are so many lamas later). In addition, the number of Tibetans who are exploited and become beggars is also very large in some cities. For example, in Rikaze, there are more than 4,000 beggars out of 14,000 citizens (including 4,000 lamas). The landlord class in Tibet owns a large amount of land. According to Tibetan regulations, the highest ownership of land belongs to the Tibetan king. According to estimates, the specific allocation of cultivated land and pastures in Tibet is 30% for nobles and temples, and 40% for the "Tibetan government" - part of which is given to high-ranking officials as salaries, and another part is distributed to various organs as expenses. The manors of government organs are generally contracted by powerful people (not nobles) at a certain rent. These people are called "Chaba" in Tibetan, which is equivalent to the second landlord; the amount of land they contract is often very large. For example, the four "Chaba" of Kangxi Jiangda Zong contracted all the land of the "Jiangda Zong government," and the rent payment alone was as much as 126,000 catties of highland barley.

	The oppression and exploitation of farmers by the feudal lords in their territories are very serious. For example, servants employed by landlords or tenant farmers who rent land are not allowed to leave home without the landlord's permission. Even if they can get permission, they must pay a huge amount of money, and during the period of absence, even if it is only one or two months, they must be fully responsible for the landlord and taxes. If farmers escape and are arrested, in addition to paying all the arrears during the escape period, they must also be severely punished. The punishments are so cruel that they even involve cutting off limbs, noses, and ears, just like a hell on earth. As for the exploitation situation, landlords forcibly rent part of the land to farmers, and the annual tribute accounts for about 80% of the annual harvest; another part is forced to be cultivated by farmers without any compensation. In addition, farmers have to pay various temporary levies imposed by the landlords and perform corvée labor. For example, when landlords build houses or trade and transport goods, which often last for several months, farmers have to provide labor and animals without any compensation, and they also have to bring their own meals; if they are building houses, they also have to give gifts to the landlords to celebrate after the houses are built. In terms of military service, in addition to the "Tibetan government" recruiting soldiers, there are often conflicts between major landlords, and each time farmers have to provide their own guns, horses, and food to fight for them. There is no compensation for deaths, and the losses suffered in defeat have to be shared and compensated by the farmers. In addition, there are various strange burdens on farmers. Even when there is a natural disaster and the harvest is not good, it is said that the farmers' respect for the gods is not good, and they have to pay fines to the landlords. Therefore, the treatment of farmers by Tibetan landlords is as harsh as Zhao Shengduo wrote in his article "Research on the Social Life and Customs of the Tibetan People": "There is even more than the manor system of Russia in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries." In addition, the exploitation of herders by Tibetan landlords who own pastures is also very serious. According to Tibetan standards, there are two types of herders. One type has their own cattle and sheep and graze on the landlords' pastures, paying rent with animal products. These herders do not have fixed residences. The other type of herders have nothing of their own, rent the landlords' cattle and sheep, and graze on the landlords' pastures. In addition to paying rent, they must also be responsible for breeding livestock. The method of breeding livestock is: Cattle herds are usually based on a three-for-one system, that is, every three cows must increase by one cow every year; sheep herds are usually based on a two-for-one system, and the lightest is the non-birth and non-death system. When herders return the lease, they return the bred livestock together with the livestock at the time of the lease to the landlord.

	The peasants and herdsmen of Tibet live under this cruel exploitation. Therefore, in order to maintain their lives, the peasants have to increase their working hours and engage in sideline production. It is said that they work about 18 hours a day, but they still cannot get enough food and clothing all year round. Therefore, most Tibetan peasants are prematurely old. People around the age of thirty mostly look like they are forty or fifty. Once they can no longer engage in labor, if they have no children or have children who cannot afford to raise the elderly, they can only take the dead end of becoming beggars. Herdsmen are equally poor. Many people live on cheese dregs all year round, and even zanba is regarded as a treasure.

	In short, the lives of the Tibetan people are very painful under the oppression of feudal forces. Fortunately, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has already marched into Tibet, and I think the broad masses of the Tibetan people will soon be liberated. This is a great cause for celebration for the Tibetan people.

　　西藏的一般状况
    刘贯一
    西藏地居中国西南部，离北京约有一万三千华里。西藏整个面积为九十万零五千平方公里（一说一百二十余万平方公里），全境东西广约二千六百公里，南北长约一千二百公里，约等于德法两国面积的总合，在我国仅次于新疆，居全国第二位。它的北界为新疆，东北界为青海，东界为西康，东南界为云南，西南两界为印度与缅甸，其中夹着不丹、尼泊尔、锡金（即哲孟雄）三个小国家。在这个高原上住着的藏族和若干其他小族，共有三百七十二万二千人，以这样广阔的地区仅住有三百七十余万的人口，当然是地广人稀，如以人口折合面积计算，每方公里仅有四个人。
    西藏的地形
    西藏是个高原，且在世界上都是有名的，它的面积平均高度在五千公尺以上，所以有“世界屋脊”之称；仅南部雅鲁藏布江流域成一狭长的河谷，为藏境人烟较盛，物产较富的地区。山脉均极高峻，横亘北部的为昆仑山脉，昆仑山脉的南支唐古次山脉，迤逦在青藏青康之间；冈底斯山脉在雅鲁藏布江以北，喜马拉雅山脉，蜿蜒在印度、西藏、尼泊尔、不丹界上，且为我国西南的屏障，其主峰埃佛勒斯峰，高达八八四○公尺，为世界第一高峰。
    河流以南部的雅鲁藏布江为主川，上源为马泉河，发源于冈底斯山脉，横贯于喜马拉雅，外喜马拉雅二大山脉间的谷地，东流会拉喀藏布河、拉萨河等入西康境，全河流长一千八百里。次为西部的印度河，其上源为狮泉河、象泉河、狼河等，皆源出冈底斯山西麓，入印度合为印度河，注阿剌伯海。高原之上，湖沼甚多，中部尤其星罗棋布，以腾格里海、布喀池、奇林湖、班公湖、扎林湖、玛那萨沃池等为最大。腾格里海与玛那萨沃池，藏人皆尊为“灵地”，最大的腾格里湖有九百五十公里。此外在章塘的淡水湖、盐湖共有数百，盐湖盖有多数方里的盐或盐碱，有些盐湖简直等于平地，沿湖有炭酸钾、苏打、硼砂等。但这些湖多是内湖，湖水不能外流，夏季便成沼泽区，就是河流也因大部湍急不利通航，仅雅鲁藏布江会合拉萨河一段数百里间可通舟楫。
    西藏的区划
    在地区划分上，西藏分为前藏、后藏和阿里三部分。
    “拉萨”是“圣地”的意思，是唐代吐蕃国的旧都，现为前藏首邑，亦为全藏政治、宗教、文化、工商业的中心，城垣位于拉萨河北岸掩蔽的河谷内，四周高山环抱，平畴广阔，气候很温和，土质很肥沃，故农业相当发展，拉萨城附近亦可种蔬菜、苹果、桃子及花草等类。同时拉萨大道四通八达，因而商业颇繁盛，贸易以谷物、牲畜、砖茶为主，城内已有电灯电话等设备，居民约有六七万人，其中喇嘛约占四五万人。城西北布达拉山上有布达拉寺，亦名皇宫，为一十三层之高大建筑，壮丽异常，为藏人最高建筑术的表现，亦为世界上最显赫的建筑之一，达赖喇嘛就住在这皇宫里面。日喀（一名扎什伦布）为后藏首邑，地在雅鲁藏布江与年楚河合口处，高出海面一万二千尺，背山面水，形势壮伟，商业亦颇发达，居民约九千人，附近沃野相连，农业亦相当繁盛，西南有扎什伦寺，周三里，绕以城壁，规模仅次于拉萨的布达拉寺，是前班禅喇嘛驻在地。噶大克亦称噶尔渡或加托克，为阿里部首邑，在印度河上流，为西藏西陲的重要都会，与噶什米尔相距甚近，即离苏联国境也不远，北可通新疆，此地在英帝国主义者逼迫下，于光绪三十年（即西历一九○四年）与江孜同时开为商埠，现在每年夏季与印度贸易甚盛，惟到冬季则因冰雪封阻，商路断绝。
    西藏的交通
    西藏的交通，因地处多山，同时又在封建势力多年统治之下，当然是比较落后的。河流不通航，铁路至今尚未有，虽原有川藏铁路的计划，惟迄未勘测。因此与外地的交通仅靠兽力运输的大道。西藏与外地相通的大道共有四线，一线由拉萨北行越过近两万英尺的高山，过库库诺尔到甘肃兰州西的湟源，路长三千七百零五里，驿行约须五十天到六十天，因为夏天水草多，同时天气亦温暖，故一般商旅多在夏天行走。一线为由拉萨东行，经太昭、昌都、巴安、理化，打箭炉（即现今西康省会康定）到四川成都，此路较由兰州至拉萨略近，过去多由内地运茶到西藏，故有“茶路”之称。一线为由拉萨西南行，经江孜、亚东至大吉岭，再继续至锡金或至靠近大吉岭的加里蚌，为西藏至印度的贸易商道，由拉萨到印度的干托克共约三百三十里，邮件需八天至十天可达。一线为由拉萨西至印度河上游的噶大克，再到拉达克的首府列城，共有九百里。极西联接印度与新疆的山道，从斯瑞那加通过波择耳与洪扎两山道可到新疆的疏勒。
    西藏与中国内地交通是这样的阻塞与不方便，但由印度到西藏却是一种相反的情形，过去英国所建的印藏铁路已通至藏边大吉岭，从大吉岭到亚东经江孜又有汽车可去拉萨。英帝国主义者建筑这条铁路，当然是为了通过这条铁路来便于侵略西藏。
    西藏的气候
    西藏因地处高原，故在这个百万方公里的地方竟约有四分之三高在拔海万英尺以上。因而西藏气候受制于其地势与周围的山地很大，最高地带空气相当稀薄，同时受强烈阳光的辐射，使得昼夜温度变化很大，昼夜温差超过八十度，短促的夏季有达九十度的，冬季有低至负四十度，当然冬季的冷，主要还是由于强烈的风所致的。不仅昼夜温差很大，同时各地温差亦很大，例如雅鲁藏布江谷地区气候相当温和，而向风的喜马拉亚山坡，又变成了副热带气候，至北部的高原地带，却又非常寒冷了。如以拉萨附近的气候作标准来看西藏气候的话，拉萨的气候是这样：该地分为两个不同的气节，五月至九月为雨季或生长季，其余月份为寒季或干季，春秋两季皆极短促。因地形混乱了风向，故夏季东南季风显明，冬天则多西风，而且支持时间较长，一月均温为三十二度，七月均温为六十四度，年均温四十八度。在雨季以前五月温度最高，一年平均有二百二十五天有霜。根据拉萨气象台的报告，一九三五、一九三七、一九三八的三年的平均年雨量为十八英寸。
    因为西藏每个地区所处的地形不同，当然气候有很大的差异，因此在生产上也就发生显著的变化。在气候比较温和的雅鲁藏布江流域，是可资耕种的地区，盛产稞麦，而大麦、小麦、豆、稻等亦略有生产。牧畜以北部为最发达，除牛、羊、马、骆驼等外，尚有特产的犛牛与山间的熊、鹿、牛羚等野兽。而且羚羊角、犀角、鹿茸、麝香等，为西藏有名的特产，每年输出数量甚大。西藏的农业不甚发达，气候地理固有很大原因，同时西藏人民的生活，有许多人是靠游牧生活的，他们的主要食品是肉类和奶类（一如蒙古人民生活一样），这也是农业不甚发达的原因，如果今后能将土壤详细调查，并开发水利，培育适合的品种，在许多沼泽地区农业生产仍有很大发展前途的。
    西藏的工商业
    西藏的工商业，当然也很落后，除拉萨有兵工厂、发电厂、造币厂各一家外，此外还无近代工业，仅有手工业，手工业出品最著名的为藏香及氆氇。吴省钦在他的一首藏香诗里这样描写着：“甘松及珠贝，百炼入铛铁?，捣作元霜精，搓作金管貌，星星微火来，烟篆四腾掉，其臭淡无言，其炉光有曜，重帷闭少时，融液透百窍，辟邪具神通，那必数医疗。”虽不免有些夸大，但不难看出它的名贵。至于氆氇，系以绵羊毛织成，美观而又结实，上两项手工业作品，西藏每年输出亦多。至于商业情形，西藏有藏香、羊毛、犛牛、皮革、药材、盐等物输出，输入的有布匹、棉纱、茶、谷等。输入品中茶为大宗，且向以华茶为主，过去由内地输运到藏的砖茶，每年约在一千三百万磅上下。惟华茶自川运藏，运费过高，故已为印度茶商所运的茶所排挤。在西藏输出物品中，以羊毛为大宗，据印度年鉴载，每年输印的羊毛约在三百至五百万斤，另据一九四八年西藏“财长”萨卡巴称，此项输出羊毛，价值约在三四百万美元，食盐每年输出约在二千二百万吨至三千万吨，多输往不丹和尼泊尔。西藏对外地贸易地点为打箭炉（对四川贸易地点）、阿墩子（为对云南贸易地点）、西宁（为对青海贸易地点）。对国外贸易以对印度为主，贸易地点在亚东、江孜及加托克三地。这三个地点是帝国主义经济侵略西藏的据点。亚东一名茅屯，为西藏南面门户，介于不丹及锡金之间，光绪十九年辟为商埠，距印度大吉岭仅八十里。江孜一名季阳则，在日喀则的西南，为藏印交通冲要地点，光绪三十二年因“中英条约”与加托克共开为商埠，这些对外贸易商埠的开辟，对于外货输入，非常便利。西藏的输入品中，大部分来自印度及尼泊尔、不丹、锡金等国家，故今天西藏的商业权亦大部分操于印度政府的手里，这就是为什么印度政府不愿意我们解放西藏的原因之一。
    西藏的资源
    西藏的农业商业及工业虽皆不甚发达，但西藏尚未开发的物质资源仍是相当丰富的。例如西藏矿产蕴藏量就很大，前日本樱井基峰在其西藏游记中曾说：“仅西藏矿产一端已有建筑铁路的资格。”西藏境内矿藏之富，首推东部之金，量多质良，据花得乐英军入藏记矿务类上讲，仅拉萨以北的纳尔仓，矿苗即长约九百里，所以外人喻西藏金量为北美加利福尼亚省（California）第二。西北部的罗克多一带产金亦富，且因产金而使此地出名，这个产金地方，在印度河上游，为新疆通印度的山径，其余阿拉泰、托克扎龙等地都产金。次于金的，即为湖盐，西藏大多数湖泊产盐，特别以唐格拉攸穆等十一盐池为最丰饶。湖盐为西藏人民换买粮食最主要原料，西藏人民主要食粮为青稞，而青稞产量不够需要的半数，但西藏有广漠无垠的食盐，藏民得以尽量采取，用犛牛拉往尼泊尔、不丹两国以换取小麦（因尼泊尔、不丹盛产小麦）。其他矿物如银、铜、锡、铅、煤、松蕊、水银、玛瑙、琥珀、磨石、金石、硫磺、石燕、石膏、石绵、水晶、墨晶、金钢石、黑硝矾等亦到处皆有。近来帝国主义者的反动报纸又不断宣传说西藏矿里有制造原子弹的铀。帝国主义者为了屠杀人类，当然也就注意屠杀人类的原料。
    西藏的文化教育与政府军队
    西藏的文化教育与政府、军队情形：西藏的统治阶级几千年来利用宗教作为统治人民的一种工具，所以拢络人民崇奉佛教，因此现在西藏的所谓教育，也就是佛教，除极少数高僧贵族绅士娴于佛教外，其他人民什九未受教育，不独不识汉文，且对藏文字母亦多不识，故文化非常落后。学校除前藏别蚌后藏札什伦布有官立藏文大学（即藏人所谓的紫老札）二所专门作为教育贵族子弟外，其余各县无一定学校，即有的也完全属于宗教教育，不能与新式学校并论。此外也有些像中国内地似的私塾，有的甚至男女合班，但皆人数不多，且以小喇嘛居多，并多以戒律、诸论、六度、因明、空经等佛点为必修科以麻醉人民。
    西藏政府的组织：因西藏政治的特点是“政教合一”，所以政权的支配者即为宗教领袖，在政治上完全是一种集权，政权教权集中一人，好像中古时代的欧洲罗马教皇一样。西藏的宗教领袖为达赖，故政权领袖亦为达赖。达赖之下有三“司伦”（司伦相当于国民党政府的院长），“司伦”之下设立“噶厦”，为“西藏政府”的最高权力机关。此最高权力机关由“噶布伦”四人组成（噶布伦相当于部长或委员），其人选例定俗三僧一，由四“噶布伦”组织行政会议秉承达赖及“司伦”的命令行使一切政权。“噶厦”之下各文武机关均以四品官管辖之（按西藏官等，达赖为一品、“司伦”为二品，“噶布伦”为二品，秘书长、秘书、总司令、代本“团长”为四品。以下还有五、六、七品等级）。西藏的“拉萨政府”共以三百五十名僧俗官员组成的。西藏的地方行政机构，基本单位为“宗”（宗等于内地的县，每宗设有宗本，等于内地的县长，宗又分为大宗、中宗、小宗、边宗四种），所有关于地方政治军事教育等概归其管理。据一九四八年中华年鉴载“西藏政府”辖区内共有一百二十三个“宗”（一说一百三十宗或一百七十宗）。宗以下为乡，（藏名不详），设有“却本”（有称“更布”者），“却本”以下有“米米”（一称“新本”或“俄巴”相当内地的村长），“米米”之下为“家本”（即村内的组长）。“西藏政府”过去曾有亲汉派与亲英派之争，自亲英派于一九四七年七月将亲汉派热振摄政杀死后，“西藏政府”遂完全成为亲英派所掌握，这也就是为什么“西藏政府”反对我进军西藏和解放西藏人民的原因之一。
    西藏的军队：西藏在清时还无正规部队，乾隆五十七年，始为额定五千一百六十五名兵，清失统驭后，到民国初年，西藏始建近代式部队。在一九四六年以前，藏军共有步、骑、炮兵共十三个“代本”（“代本”说是等于团，实际上等于营，因每一“代本”仅有五六百人），估计约有八千人。据今年七月缅甸时报载称：西藏正规军人数约一万二千人。实际上该时不会到一万二千人。因据最近（即十月三十日）加尔各答电称，旅印藏人还说：“西藏除有十四代本军队，每代本约五百人，总计七千人。”另最近到台湾活动的达赖之兄嘉乐赖珠于一九五○年十一月四日对台湾记者称：“我们仅有八千名民军。”由此可以判断，西藏正式武装只不过八千人左右，即令于我军进军后扩充也不过一万至一万二千人，当然可能还有后备部队一万到二万，但大部分无枪。另西藏民间存有枪枝约万支左右。西藏军队的装备，据一九四九年伪国防部统计，全藏共有机枪四十挺，迫击炮二十门，野炮二十门，山炮六门，步兵炮十门，步枪连库存在内约三万余支（枪龄多已古老，有的甚至已不能用）。实际上可能比这些数字多些，因在印度的“西藏代表团”也不否认：“西藏确曾向印度购买军火。”（见一九五○年六月四日法新社巴黎电引印度广播称）。西藏军事的编制系统是：（一）“马基康”——即直属噶厦的军备处，是西藏最高军事机关，管辖全藏军队，有“马基”（即总司令之意，三品官）四人（过去仅一人，一九四七年增至四人）。（二）“代”——相当于团，是藏军编制的最高单位，每“代”设“代本”（相当团长，四品官）二人。各团的代号，系按藏文三十个字母的秩序排列。（三）“如”——相当于营，设“如本”（相当营长，五品官）一人。（四）“甲”——相当于连，设“甲本”（相当连长，六品官）一人。（五）“定”——相当于排，设“定本”（相当排长，七品官）一人。（六）“久”——相当于班，设“久本”（相当班长）一人，班为部队最基层组织。藏军的训练并不很好，在一九一八年“西藏政府”曾设立有“仲札马噶”（即贵族教训队），完全由英帝国主义者派人主持。达赖十三死后，“仲札马噶”停办，英帝国主义者在江孜办一军官训练团，代为训练军官。西藏贵族子弟亦有不少到英、印学军事的。西藏的军队纪律很不好，时常敲诈人民，不过攻击精神还好，只要攻击令下，即蜂拥前进，但如一败，则溃不成军。
    西藏人民的生活
    最后谈谈西藏人民的生活：西藏基本上是一个封建社会，因此西藏的统治阶级将西藏人分为三等九级，各级间不相往来，不通庆吊，界限非常严明。这三等九级是：（一）拉布（上等）：拉布楷拉布为上等上级，达赖摄政及达赖之家属等属之。拉布楷丁（上等中级）：司伦噶伦、甘丹赤巴（甘丹寺主讲）及各大寺之活佛，格喜（僧人的一种学位）等属之。拉布楷达马（上等下级）：秘书、代本、宗本及普通喇嘛属之。（二）丁（中等）：丁楷拉布（中等上级）：地主、英雄、世家的后裔及能独力捐资“助国”者属之。丁楷丁（中等中级）：书记、小吏、侍从、庖人等属之。丁楷达马（中等下级）：军人、农民等属之。（三）达马（下等）：达马拉布（下等上级）：官吏的婢仆属之。达马丁（下等中级）：无定居者、独身男女、乞丐等属之。达马达马（下等下级）：屠人、清道者、收尸者、金工、铁工等属之。西藏人民虽分为三等九级，但基本对立的阶级是地主阶级和农民阶级，西藏还没有无产阶级，不过随着帝国主义的入侵，已经产生了买办性的商业资本家。此外尚有一个庞大的社会寄生集团——喇嘛，据一般估计，喇嘛占西藏总人口十分之一至二。（喇嘛为什么这样多，我们将另述及之）。此外，藏人被剥削而流为乞丐的，在某些城市数目也非常之多，如日喀一万四千市民中（包括喇嘛四千）即有四千多是乞丐。西藏的地主阶级拥有大量的土地，按西藏规定土地最高所有权属于藏王，西藏已耕地及牧地的具体分配，据估计贵族及寺院各占十分之三，“藏政府”占十分之四——其中一部分给高级官吏，充作薪俸，另一部分分给各机关充作经费。政府机关的庄园一般的均由地方有势力的人（不是贵族）以一定的租额承包，这种人藏语叫作“差巴”，相当于二地主；他们所承包的土地数量往往很大，例如康西江达宗四家“差巴”就承包了“江达宗政府”的全部土地，仅缴租即达十二万六千斤青稞之多。
    各封建领主在其领地内，对农民的压迫与剥削非常厉害，譬如地主所雇用的奴仆或租与土地的佃农，不经地主许可，不准离家，即便在能请准的情况下，也必须缴付巨款，而且在离开期间，那么就是一两个月，也必须对地主与赋税负完全责任，假如农民潜逃被捕后，除须交足逃亡时期的欠款外，并须受严厉的刑罚，刑罚之惨甚至于割肢断体，剜鼻去耳，直似人间地狱一般。至于剥削情形，地主将土地一部分强迫租给农民，年贡约占年收获量的十分之八；另一部分则强迫农民耕地，不付任何代价。此外，农民还要贡纳地主各种临时征收的物品，还要服劳役当兵，例如地主修建房屋，贸易运输，动辄数月之久，都要农民出夫出畜，不但没有代价，而且还要自己带饭；如果是修建房屋，修好后还要向地主送礼庆祝。在兵役方面，除“西藏政府”征兵外，各大地主之间常有冲突，每次都要农民自备枪马、粮食等为之作战，打死了没有扶恤，战败了所遭受的损失，还要由农民分担赔偿。此外对农民还有着各种稀奇古怪的负担，甚至遇到天灾收成不佳，也说是农民敬神不周，要向地主缴纳罚款。所以西藏地主对农民待遇之苛，正如赵盛铎所写的《西藏民族之社会生活及礼俗之研究》一文中所说的：“有甚于十二、三世纪俄国的庄园（Cmanor）制度”，另外，西藏拥有牧场的地主对牧民的剥削同样是很厉害的，按西藏的牧民分两种，一种是自己有牛羊，在地主的牧场上放牧，即以畜产品缴租，这种牧民无固定住所；另一种牧民自己一无所有，租地主的牛羊，并在地主的牧场上放牧，他们除了缴租外，并须负责繁殖牲畜，这种繁殖牲畜办法：牛群通常用三生一制，即每三头母牛每年要增牛一头；羊群通常是用二生一制，最轻的是不生不死制，牧民退租时将所繁殖的牲畜连同起租时的牲畜，一并还给地主。
    西藏的农民和牧民在这种残酷剥削下，所以农民为了维持生活，不得不再增加劳动时间，进行副业生产，据说他们每天工作都在十八小时左右，但是他们仍然终年不得温饱。因此西藏农民大多未老先衰，一般三十岁左右的人，多已望若四五十许，一旦不能再从事劳动时，假使无子女或有而无力抚养老人，便只有走上乞丐的一条死路。牧民是同样的贫困，许多人终年以奶渣为生，甚至连糌粑都被当作珍品。
    总之，西藏人民在封建势力压迫下，生活是非常痛苦的，幸而我中国人民解放军业已进军西藏，想西藏广大的人民不久即可得到解放，这是深可为西藏人民庆幸的。
