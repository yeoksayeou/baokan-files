　　The anti-American movement has penetrated into the neighborhoods of Shanghai.
    Parades and Demonstrations Held, Symposia Denounce U.S. Imperialist Atrocities
    [Report from this newspaper] According to Shanghai Xinwen Ribao and Wenhui Bao: The Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Home, Defend the Nation movement in Shanghai has penetrated into various neighborhoods. In recent days, organized neighborhoods have universally launched current affairs study and propaganda activities. Residents' mutual aid associations in Yaoshui Lane, Meifang Lane, Xitan, and other neighborhoods in the Putuo District have held current affairs symposiums.
    The wall newspapers of the Huangpu District's Baoyu Lane, Baoxing Lane, Yong'an Fang, and other neighborhood welfare associations have all published special issues on resisting America and aiding Korea. Baoyu Lane also held a "Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Home, Defend the Nation" propaganda meeting in Huangpu Public Security Bureau square on the 11th, performing a living newspaper drama "U.S. Military Atrocities." Baoyu Lane, Baoxing Lane, Yong'an Fang, and Changxing Lane will jointly hold an anti-American parade. More than 300 people from Songshan District's Peifu Lane, Zhicheng Lane, Yongqing Lane, Liuhe Lane, Zhenping Lane, Qingping Fang, Lanxin Lane, street vendor groups, and Far East medical teams held a demonstration parade on the major streets of Songshan District at 2:00 p.m. on the 12th. Residents along the road welcomed the parade with firecrackers. Enraged citizens excitedly beat the war profiteer cartoons in the parade and shouted: "Defeat the American aggressors!" In addition to participating in the parade, the Zhicheng Lane and Yongqing Lane welfare associations also carried out in-depth propaganda in nearby Tongzhi Fang, Dingning Lane, Sanxin Lane, Xinmin Fang, Gui'an Lane, and other neighborhoods, calling on people to "not listen to rumors, not listen to the 'Voice of America.'" The fourth branch of the Yimiao District Cleaning and Sanitation Association convened a street and neighborhood residents' propaganda meeting at Tangye Middle School on the evening of the 11th, attended by more than 600 residents from various neighborhoods. At the meeting, residents Shen Haoting, Zhao Zhijun, Luo Weiying, and others denounced the atrocities of U.S. imperialism. Wang, an old lady nearly sixty years old from Fuchun Street, said: "My husband died early, and I completely relied on my only daughter who worked in a factory to make a living. Unexpectedly, three years ago, she was beaten to death on the side of the Suzhou River because she refused to be molested by three American sailors. I cried to the Chiang Kai-shek government, but they only replied 'We don't care.' At that time, I cried my heart out, but there was nothing I could do. Now the American bandits are invading us again, we must unite and resist them, and I must avenge my daughter!" Her tragic experience particularly moved everyone, and the entire audience shouted slogans to drive away the American bandits. The Laozha District government held current affairs symposiums in Yanqing Lane and Zunde Lane to raise residents' awareness. Mr. Wang Wancheng, an elderly resident representative of the district, said: "I am now over sixty years old, and among the invaders I have seen, the American bandits are more ferocious than any other invader. Although I am old and cannot directly participate in the war, I will assist the government in doing neighborhood work, and write letters to my daughter-in-law and grandson who are working in the People's Liberation Army, asking them to work hard to build a strong national defense force and resolutely defend the people's motherland."

　　沪反美运动深入里弄
    游行示威举行座谈痛诉美帝暴行
    【本报讯】据上海新闻日报、文汇报消息：抗美援朝保家卫国运动在上海市已深入各里弄。连日来各有组织里弄已普遍展开时事学习和宣传活动。普陀区药水弄、梅芳里、西滩等里弄居民互助会，均纷纷举行时事座谈会。
    黄浦区宝裕里、宝兴里、永安坊等里弄福利会墙报均出抗美援朝专刊。宝裕里并于十一日在黄浦公安分局广场举行“抗美援朝、保家卫国”宣传会，演出“美军暴行”活报。宝裕里、宝兴里、永安坊、昌兴里四里弄将联合举行反美游行一次。嵩山区培福里、志成里、永清里、六合里、振平里、庆平坊、兰馨里、摊贩组、远东医疗组等三百余人，十二日下午二时，在嵩山区各主要街道举行示威大游行，沿路居民用爆竹欢迎游行队伍。愤怒的市民激动得敲着游行队伍中的战贩漫画高喊：“打败美国侵略者！”志成里、永清里福利会除参加游行外，并在附近同志坊、鼎宁里、三鑫里、新民坊、归安里等里弄作深入宣传，号召“勿听谣言，勿听‘美国之音’。”邑庙区清洁卫生第四分会，于十一日晚，借糖业中学召开街道里弄居民宣传大会，到有各里弄居民六百多人。会上居民沈豪庭、赵志骏、罗维英等纷纷控诉美帝暴行。阜春街近六十岁的王老太太说：“我的丈夫早死，完全靠一个独养女儿在工厂做工过活，万不料三年前在苏州河沿，她因不服三个美国烂水手调戏，竟被活活打死路旁。我向蒋介石政府哭诉，他们只回答我“不管”。那时我哭的死去活来，也没办法。现在美国强盗又来侵略我们了，我们要齐心反抗它，我更要为我的女儿报仇！”她的惨痛遭遇特别激动了大家，全场一致高呼口号，要赶走美国强盗。老闸区政府为了提高居民认识，分别在衍庆里、尊德里举行时事座谈会。该区街道居民代表王晚成老先生说：“我现在六十多岁了，我所看到的侵略者中，美国强盗比任何一个侵略者还要凶狠。我虽年纪大了，不能直接参加战争，但我要协助政府做好里弄工作，并写信给在解放军里工作的儿媳和孙子，要他们为建立强大的国防军而努力，坚决保卫人民祖国。”
