　　Beijing Branch of the China Democratic League
    Endorses the Joint Declaration of Democratic Parties

    [Reported by this newspaper] The Beijing Branch of the China Democratic League sent a letter to this newspaper expressing its sincere support for the joint declaration of the democratic parties. The letter states:

    The flames of the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Korea have now reached the banks of our Yalu River. It seriously threatens our national defense security, and it directly endangers our peaceful construction. Every Chinese person is filled with righteous indignation at the U.S. imperialist's act of aggression! We fully realize that the U.S. imperialist aggression against Korea is only the first step in its aggression against China, its domination of Asia, and its conquest of the world. We must not ignore it, and we must shatter the U.S. imperialist's conspiracy of aggression! In order to defend our homes and our country, in order to fight for the freedom, independence, and happiness of the Asian people, and also in order to strive for people's democracy and lasting peace for the people of the world, we must support the Korean people today and extinguish the spreading flames of war!

    Today, the people of the whole country feel the suffering of our Korean brothers as if it were their own. They can no longer tolerate the bloody massacre by the U.S. imperialists. The people of the whole country demand to take voluntary action to defend their homes, defend their motherland, and defend peace! We support peace and love peace, and at the same time, in order to defend peace and strive for peace, we are not afraid of a war to resist aggression. The Korean people have already demonstrated unparalleled heroism and fortitude in the just war of national defense. The spirit of patriotism and internationalism of the Chinese people will surely defeat the armed aggression of U.S. imperialism! In the revolutionary war against aggression, peace-loving people all over the world will certainly stand on our side, and the forces of democracy and peace will ultimately prevail!

    Therefore, we express our sincere support for the joint declaration issued by the democratic parties, and we pledge to work together with all our strength to complete the sacred task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country!

    美帝国主义侵朝战争的火焰，现在已经燃烧到我国的鸭绿江畔。它严重地威胁着我国的国防安全，它直接地危害到我国的和平建设。对于美帝的这种侵略暴行，每一个中国人民都是同仇敌忾的！我们完全认识到：美帝侵略朝鲜，只是侵略中国、统治亚洲和征服全世界的第一步，我们绝不能置之不理，我们一定要粉碎美帝的侵略阴谋！为了保家卫国，为了争取亚洲人民的自由、独立和幸福，也为了争取全世界人民的人民民主和持久和平，我们今天必须支援朝鲜人民，扑灭战火的延烧！
    今天全国人民对于朝鲜兄弟所遭受的苦难，都有着切肤之痛，对于美帝的血腥屠杀，已忍无可忍，全国人民都要求用志愿的行动，来保卫家乡、保卫祖国与保卫和平！我们拥护和平，热爱和平，同时为了保卫和平，争取和平，我们也绝不害怕反抗侵略的战争。朝鲜人民在正义的卫国战争中，已经表现了无比的英勇和坚强，中国人民的爱国主义与国际主义相结合的精神，也一定可以打败美帝的武装侵略！在反侵略的革命战争中，全世界爱好和平的人民，是一定站在我们这边的，民主和平的力量，最后一定会得到胜利的！
    所以，我们对于各民主党派所发表的联合宣言，表示衷诚的拥护，并誓以全力为完成抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务而共同奋斗！
