The instructions point out that any of the following behaviors shall be regarded as speculative commerce that disrupts the market and shall be strictly prohibited: 1. Engaging in the operation of other materials beyond the scope of business operations approved by the People's Government. 2. Trading outside the trading market prescribed by the local People's Government. 3. Hoarding and refusing to sell materials necessary for people's production or life, in an attempt to obtain exorbitant profits, causing price fluctuations, and affecting the local people's production or life at that time; factories hoarding finished products and refusing to sell them or hoarding raw materials for resale in order to make huge profits, causing price fluctuations, and affecting the local people's production or life at that time; the same applies as in the previous paragraph. 4. Buying and selling short, speculating and engaging in disruptive activities in an attempt to make huge profits. 5. Deliberately raising prices, rushing to buy or sell materials, and spreading rumors to stimulate people's feelings, causing price fluctuations. 6. Failing to comply with the commercial administrative management measures prescribed by the local People's Government and disrupting the market. 7. Using fake, counterfeit, adulterated or violating product specifications and using all other deceptive behaviors to seek illegal profits. 8. All those engaged in speculative activities.

The instructions say that if local trade administrative departments discover any of the above-mentioned behaviors and verify that they are true, they shall deal with them according to the severity of the circumstances and the specific local conditions, based on the principle of education and transformation as the main focus and punishment as a supplement. Trade departments in all provinces and cities shall formulate market management measures in accordance with the spirit of these instructions and in combination with local practical conditions, and shall implement them after approval and promulgation by the people's governments (or military and administrative committees) of major administrative regions.

The instructions specifically point out that trade administrative departments in various localities should educate cadres to clearly recognize that strict punishment and prohibition should only be imposed on speculative commerce that disrupts the market and affects people's production and life; for normal and legitimate business operations, the policy of free trade within the unified national economic plan should be implemented, and private factories and businesses should be guaranteed, actively organized and encouraged to abide by the law and develop in a direction that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood.
