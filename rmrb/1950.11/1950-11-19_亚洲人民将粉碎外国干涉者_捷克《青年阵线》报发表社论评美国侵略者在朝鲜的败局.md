Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 18th. The Czechoslovak Youth League's official newspaper, "Young Front," published an editorial on the 16th titled "Asian People Will Crush Foreign Interventionists," pointing out that the current Far East situation has proven the strategic, moral, and political failure of the American aggressors. The editorial stated: "In June, American aggressors launched a 'blitzkrieg' in Korea, but it later proved unsuccessful. MacArthur and Acheson are currently assuring their followers of future victory, just as Hitler did after the defeat of the Battle of Stalingrad, which determined the fate of the Nazi advance into the East."

The newspaper commented on MacArthur's malicious slander against the Chinese People's Volunteers aiding Korea, saying: "Only a fool would believe the lies of this general who crossed the entire Pacific Ocean to launch an aggression against a foreign country in order to 'defend American security.'" "Only someone as mad as MacArthur could expect to gain anything from launching a war against the great China. The heroes on the Sino-Korean border have the entire Asian continent as their backing, while behind the American aggressors are only the waves of the vast ocean. The fate of the American troops currently in Asia and all future reinforcements is like the fate of a grain of sand in the Sahara Desert."

The newspaper concluded: "The only possible solution is for Washington to withdraw its aggressive troops from Korea. As long as there is a single American on Korean soil, the Korean people will never stop fighting."

　　亚洲人民将粉碎外国干涉者
    捷克《青年阵线》报发表社论评美国侵略者在朝鲜的败局
    【新华社布拉格十八日电】捷克斯洛伐克青年联盟机关报《青年阵线》，十六日以《亚洲人民将粉碎外国干涉者》为题，发表社论，指出目前的远东局势已证明美国侵略者在战略、道义、与政治上的失败。社论称：“在六月间，美国侵略者在朝鲜发动了一次‘闪击战’，但后来证明并未成功。麦克阿瑟和艾奇逊目前正向他们的追随者保证将来会得到胜利，就像希特勒在决定了纳粹东进命运的斯大林格勒之役失败以后所作的一样。”
    该报评论麦克阿瑟恶意诬蔑中国人民志愿援朝时称：“只有傻子才会相信这个为了‘保卫美国的安全’而横渡整个太平洋向一个外国发动侵略的将军的谎言。”“只有像麦克阿瑟之流那样癫狂的人，才会指望从对伟大的中国发动战争中得到什么东西。中朝边境上的英雄们，有着整个亚洲大陆做他们的后盾，而美国侵略者的后面则只有汪洋大海的波浪。美国目前在亚洲大陆的军队和将来所有的援军的命运，就像撒哈拉大沙漠上一粒沙的命运一样。”
    该报在结语中说：“唯一可能的解决办法，是让华盛顿自朝鲜撤出它的侵略军队，只要朝鲜土地上还有一个美国人，朝鲜人民就决不会停止战斗。”
