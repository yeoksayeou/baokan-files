Xinhua News Agency, November 4th: A spokesperson for the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government issued a statement, severely denouncing the Hong Kong and Ceylonese Colombo governments for unjustifiably declaring Xiamen, China, as a plague-infected port, attempting to create unreasonable restrictions on travelers and goods entering and leaving Xiamen. The spokesperson stated:

According to a report from the Xiamen Traffic Quarantine Station: The Hong Kong and Ceylonese Colombo governments unreasonably declared Xiamen, China, as a plague-infected port on July 10th and August 6th of this year, respectively. Investigations show that plague has never been discovered in Xiamen, and it should not be listed as a plague-infected port. Although plague occurred in certain counties in Fujian Province at the beginning of this year, it was extinguished long ago and did not spread to the Xiamen area.

This unfounded and arbitrary action by the Hong Kong and Ceylonese Colombo governments is clearly an attempt to confuse public opinion and create conditions for unreasonable restrictions on travelers and goods entering and leaving our country via Xiamen. The Chinese people deeply feel anger towards this arrogant behavior of the Hong Kong and Colombo governments, which is a deliberate infringement on China's national dignity, and absolutely deny the validity of this declaration.

    斥香港及哥伦坡政府无理宣布我厦门为鼠疫疫港
    【新华社四日讯】中央人民政府卫生部发言人发表谈话，严斥香港及锡兰哥伦坡政府无理宣布我厦门为鼠疫疫港，企图造成对厦门进出口旅客和货物的不合理的限制。发言人称：
    据厦门交通检疫所报告：香港及锡兰哥伦坡政府于本年七月十日及八月六日先后无理宣布我国厦门为鼠疫疫港。查厦门从未发现鼠疫，不应列为鼠疫疫港。福建省本年初虽在某些县份曾发生鼠疫，但早已扑灭，且并未延及厦门区域。
    该香港与锡兰哥伦坡政府此种毫无根据的武断行动，显系企图混淆视听，以造成经由厦门进出我国的旅客和货物的不合理的限制的条件。对香港及哥伦坡政府此种蓄意侵犯我国国家尊严的狂妄行为，中国人民深感愤怒，并绝对否认这种宣布为有效。
