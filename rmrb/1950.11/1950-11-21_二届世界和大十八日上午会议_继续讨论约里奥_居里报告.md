Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 20th: The Second World Congress of Partisans of Peace continued its session on the morning of the 18th, discussing the Joliot-Curie report.

　　The Finnish representative, Mr. Mierti, spoke first, expressing the Finnish people's determination to safeguard the cause of world peace. Mr. Miller, representative of the Scottish Miners' Union of Great Britain, condemned the British government's reactionary behavior in obstructing the World Congress of Partisans of Peace from being held in Britain. He said: We have heard shameless lies about the "Iron Curtain," but in reality, the "Iron Curtain" is on the other side of the Strait. Mr. Armstrong, a representative of Irish Christians attending the conference as an observer, said: The only path to peace is for representatives with different views to work together to overcome obstacles on the road to international cooperation.
　　Czechoslovak representative, Ms. Hodinova-Spurna, pointed out that the Czechoslovak people resolutely demand the banning of atomic weapons and the limitation of armaments, and protest against the interference of American imperialists in the internal affairs of Korea and other countries.
　　Mexican representative, Mr. Toledano, said: The struggle for freedom is inseparable from the struggle against imperialism. Imperialism is the deadly enemy of the Mexican people because it infringes upon the independence of the Mexican people. We fully support the Joliot-Curie report, and the spirit of peace will reign throughout the world.
　　Swedish representative, Pastor Heckt, called for efforts to ban atomic weapons and all weapons of mass destruction of mankind. Greek representative, Professor Kokalis, recounted the heroic resistance of the Greek people against imperialism.
　　French representative, Mr. Guede, pointed out that the Western people, who had been misled by reactionary propaganda, now clearly see the truth about the Korean War, and the hatred of millions of people for the American aggressors is growing.
　　Next, Soviet representative, Mr. Ehrenburg, delivered a speech stating: We propose to the Congress to adopt the following resolution to prohibit propaganda for a new war and promote mutual understanding among the people of all countries: In view of the fact that propaganda for a new war, which is being carried out in several countries, has caused the most serious threat to the peaceful cooperation of the people of all countries, and that propaganda for a new war is the most serious crime against mankind, the Congress hereby issues an appeal to the parliaments of all countries, urging them to promulgate special "Laws for the Protection of Peace," stipulating that anyone engaged in propaganda for a new war in the form of speeches, writings, news, radio, or films shall be held criminally responsible. The Congress also appeals to the parliaments of all countries to ensure that the younger generation is educated in the spirit of cooperation with the people of other countries and respect for other nationalities, in order to consolidate peace.
　　During the afternoon session of the 18th, Indian representative, Dr. Attal, spoke first, saying: We Asian people know who is defending peace and who wants to start a war. The people we want to stand with are the people who teach us to grow abundant and high-quality grains, who teach us to grow wheat in places where we could not grow wheat before, and who teach us how to eliminate the disasters of human exploitation.
　　When the great Chinese people's representative, Guo Moruo, stepped onto the podium to deliver a long speech, he was warmly welcomed by the participants, and thunderous applause resounded throughout the hall. Guo Moruo submitted the Chinese delegation's proposal for consideration by the Congress.
　　American representative, Mr. Apphaus, spoke, exposing the mad war propaganda carried out by the American ruling clique and how they poisoned the minds of the American people. He said: The American people want peace as much as the people of other countries. Now, three million American people have signed the peace declaration, and more than one million people have signed other peace petitions. Mr. Apphaus submitted the American delegation's proposal to the Congress for consideration, advocating that the United States and the Soviet Union should engage in friendly peaceful competition in the next ten years. This can eliminate the threat of war and encourage the people of the world.
　　After the Dutch representative spoke, Canadian representative, Mr. Endicott, spoke, saying: Opinion polls in Canada show that more than 60 percent of the people nationwide demand the banning of atomic weapons. He then read out the Canadian delegation's proposal. The proposal pointed out that peaceful coexistence of the two systems is possible, the use of war as a means of resolving international disputes must be prohibited, all foreign troops should withdraw from Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, and Taiwan, and the United States should not be allowed to provide any assistance to maintain the colonial slavery system. Any country that wants to maintain the colonial system should be considered an aggressor.

　　二届世界和大十八日上午会议
    继续讨论约里奥—居里报告
    【新华社二十日讯】综合塔斯社华沙消息：第二届世界保卫和平大会十八日上午继续开会，讨论约里奥居里的报告。  芬兰代表麦尔蒂首先发言，他代表芬兰人民表示维护世界和平事业的决心。英国的苏格兰矿工联盟代表米勒谴责了英国政府阻挠世界和大在英举行的反动行为，他说：我们曾听过关于“铁幕”的无耻谎言，但实际上“铁幕”是在海峡的那一边。以观察员资格列席大会的爱尔兰基督教徒代表艾姆斯特朗说：唯一的和平之路，便是持有不同见解的代表，共同努力克服走上国际合作道路的障碍。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表荷第诺娃—斯普尔纳指出，捷克斯洛伐克人民坚决要求禁止原子武器及限制军备，并抗议美帝国主义者干涉朝鲜及其他国家的内政。
    墨西哥代表托列达诺说：争取自由的斗争是与反对帝国主义的斗争不可分开的，帝国主义是墨西哥人民的死敌，因为它侵害了墨西哥人民的独立。我们全力支持约里奥—居里的报告，和平的精神将统治全世界。
    瑞典代表海克特牧师呼吁为禁止原子武器及一切大规模夷灭人类的武器而努力。希腊代表科卡利斯教授讲述了希腊人民英勇反抗帝国主义的情形。
    法国代表格德指出：曾被反动宣传迷惑的西方人民，今天已看清楚了朝鲜战争的真相，千百万人民对美国侵略者的憎恨已日益增长。
    接着，苏联代表爱伦堡发表演说称：我们向大会提议通过禁止新战争宣传并促进各国人民互相谅解如下决定：鉴于若干国家正在进行的新战争宣传已造成对各国人民和平合作的最严重的威胁，而新战争宣传是残害人类的最严重的罪行，因此大会特向各国议会发出呼吁，敦促他们颁布特别的“保卫和平法律”，规定凡以演说、文字、新闻、广播或电影等形式从事新战争宣传者，均应负刑事责任。大会并向各国议会呼吁，敦促他们为了巩固和平，应确保以与他国人民实行合作、尊重其他民族的精神来教育年青的一代。
    十八日下午开会时，印度代表阿塔尔博士首先发言称：我们亚洲人民知道谁在保卫和平，谁要发动战争。我们要和他站在一起的人，是教给我们种植丰盛和品质优良的谷物的人，是教给我们在从前不能种小麦的地方种小麦，教给我们如何消灭人剥削人的灾难的人。
    当伟大的中国人民代表郭沫若登上讲台，发表长篇演说时，受到了与会者的热烈欢迎，暴风雨般的掌声响彻全场。郭沫若将中国代表团的提案提交大会考虑。
    美国代表艾普豪斯发言，揭露了美国统治集团所进行的疯狂的战争宣传，和他们如何毒化美国人民的思想。他说：美国人民和其他国家的人民一样地希望和平。现在已有三百万美国人民在和平宣言上签了名，还有一百多万人在其他的和平请愿书上签了名。艾普豪斯将美国代表团的建议提交大会考虑，主张美国与苏联在今后十年内进行友好的和平竞争。这样可以消除战争的威胁，并鼓舞世界人民。
    在荷兰代表发言后，加拿大代表文幼章发言称：加拿大的民意测验表明了全国有百分之六十以上的人民要求禁止原子武器。随后他宣读了加拿大代表团的提案。提案指出两种制度的和平共存是可能的，必须禁止以战争为解决国际纠纷的手段，一切外国军队应退出朝鲜、越南、马来亚和台湾，不让美国有可能为保持殖民地奴役制度而提供任何援助。凡要保持殖民制度的国家都应被认为是侵略者。
