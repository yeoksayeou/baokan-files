Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 8th. A gathering of representatives from all circles in Shenyang to celebrate the Soviet October Revolution Day was held yesterday. More than 1,900 people's representatives from all circles in Northeast China attended. Soviet Consul General in Shenyang, Ledov, representatives of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Trade, Boyko, and representatives of Soviet experts, Davnachenko, and other foreign guests were also invited to participate. Gao Gang, Secretary of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, made a report at the meeting. He pointed out: The victory of the October Revolution built a strong fortress of peace for the whole world, and encouraged the people all over the world who love peace to have confidence in defeating imperialist war. After the October Revolution, the Soviet people have always sympathized with and aided the Chinese revolution. Due to birth of the People's Republic of China and the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, alliance and Mutual Assistance, the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people has become more consolidated and developed. For China, this guarantees that China can obtain a large amount of technical and economic assistance and obtain a strong allied force to resist imperialist aggression; for the world, the Sino-Soviet friendship, alliance and mutual assistance is sufficient to defeat imperialist aggressive forces and ensure world peace. He further pointed out that American imperialism is copying the old tricks of Japanese fascism, first invading Taiwan and Korea, and then attacking China. The Chinese people must not tolerate the aggression of American imperialism, nor can they turn a blind eye to the imperialists' wanton aggression against their neighbors. Finally, Gao Gang called on the people of Northeast China to work hard to develop production, strengthen national defense construction, actively support the just struggle of the Korean people, and defend the security of the motherland and construction undertakings.

Soviet Consul General in Shenyang, Ledov, said in his speech: "The unbreakable friendship and solid alliance between the two major nations of China and the Soviet Union are the greatest force in consolidating the cause of world peace and security. The cause of democracy and socialism will surely defeat reactionary forces and warmongers, because the banner-bearer for peace, democracy, and socialism is the great Stalin." The congress concluded after passing a congratulatory telegram to Marshal Stalin. The Soviet film "The Fall of Berlin" was shown after the meeting.

On the same day, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branches and sub-branches in various government organs, factories, schools, and neighborhoods in the city, combined with the situation of the United States expanding its war of aggression and threatening our border, carried out propaganda on Sino-Soviet friendship and opposition to American aggression.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 8th. The Northeast People's Government, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and the Northeast General Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association held a cocktail party at 6:30 p.m. on the 7th to celebrate the 33rd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union. Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, Vice Chairmen Lin Feng and Gao Chongmin, Zhang Xiushan, Minister of the Organization Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Li Zhuoran, Minister of the Propaganda Department, Zhang Mingyuan, Secretary-General, Li Junfu, Secretary-General of the Northeast General Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and heads of various departments of the Northeast People's Government, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and Northeast People's organizations attended. Invited guests included Soviet Consul General in Shenyang, Ledov, Vice Consuls Maslov and Gaitilin, and Soviet experts. During the meeting, the hosts and guests repeatedly raised their glasses to celebrate the friendship between China and the Soviet Union and the good health of Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people, and Marshal Stalin, the mentor of the world people.
