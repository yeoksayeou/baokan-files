　　Korean People's Guerrilla Units Become Increasingly Active
    Once Capturing Chuncheon and Singye
    [Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch] The Korean People's Guerrilla Units, fighting valiantly behind enemy lines, not only threaten the enemy's supply lines, but have also developed to the point of attacking cities occupied by the enemy. According to an Associated Press dispatch from the US military headquarters on the 20th: a US Eighth Army spokesman confirmed that the Korean People's Guerrilla Units, operating in the rear of the US forces invading Korea, once "occupied Chuncheon and Singye, fifty-five miles southeast of Pyongyang."
    According to a United Press dispatch from Seoul on the 18th: the Korean People's Guerrilla Units continuously attacked Hwacheon, north of Chuncheon, and occupied high ground controlling the road north of Hongcheon (fifteen miles south of Chuncheon). Officials responsible for the American invading forces, pinned down by the People's Guerrilla Units, have been forced to admit that the increasing strength of the Korean People's Guerrilla Units has "become a serious problem."
    Meanwhile, according to a 19th dispatch from the National News Agency: the activities of the Korean People's Guerrilla Units between Pyongyang and Seoul are becoming increasingly "intense." Because the People's Guerrilla Units have "constantly harassed" the "main supply line" of the American invading forces north of Pyongyang, "no single vehicle (referring to US military vehicles) is allowed to pass during the day to avoid sudden and well-laid ambushes." Recently, "large concentrations" of People's Guerrilla Units ambushed two companies and an armed patrol of the US Second Division near Heochang (transliteration), twelve miles north of Pyongyang. A spokesman for the US Second Division admitted that one of the companies was "surrounded" three miles north of Heochang. In this battle, it is known that two American soldiers were killed and twenty were wounded. A squad that was scattered was "in grave danger."

　　朝鲜人民游击队日趋活跃
    一度攻克春川新溪两地
    【新华社二十二日讯】在敌后英勇作战的朝鲜人民游击队，不仅威胁敌人的补给线，而且发展到攻击被敌人侵占的城市。据美联社美军总部二十日电：美第八军发言人证实：在侵朝美军后方活动的朝鲜人民游击队，曾一度“攻占春川和平壤东南五十五英里的新溪”。
    另据合众社汉城十八日电：朝鲜人民游击队曾连续攻击春川以北的桦川，并攻占控制洪川（春川以南十五英里）以北道路的高地。为人民游击队所牵制的美国侵略军队负责官员已被迫承认：朝鲜人民游击队的日益强大，已“成了一个严重的问题”。
    同时，据国新社十九日消息报道：朝鲜人民游击队在平壤和汉城之间的活动日益“激烈”。由于人民游击队“一直在骚扰”平壤以北美国侵略军队的“主要补给线”，“以致在白天为了避免突然而来的和埋伏得很好的袭击，单独一辆汽车（指美军汽车）也不准通行。”最近，“大批集中”的人民游击队，曾在平壤以北十二英里的许仓（译音）附近伏击美军第二师的两个连和一支武装巡逻队。美军第二师发言人承认：其中的一个连在许仓以北三英里处“陷入重围”。在这次战斗中，已知美军两名被击毙，二十名负伤。被打散的一班人“陷于严重的危险境地”。
