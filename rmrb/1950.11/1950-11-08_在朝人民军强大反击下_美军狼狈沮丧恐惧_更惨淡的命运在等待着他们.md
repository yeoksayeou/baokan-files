Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch:

　　The powerful counterattack launched by the Korean People's Army has shattered the American aggressors' delusions of "ending the Korean War soon," and has filled the American invading forces with discouragement and fear. The news of the People's Army's counterattack "evoked a first reaction of gloom among the American troops," while the "Republic of Korea Second Army Corps" of the Syngman Rhee puppet army were "all downcast, in no mood to talk." Those enemy generals who arrogantly declared more than ten days ago, when they invaded Pyongyang, that "the next step will be the Manchurian border," appeared "deeply worried, even depressed" (Associated Press, Tokyo, October 31).

　　According to "MacArthur's 'timetable,' the Korean War was scheduled to end before Thanksgiving (November 23)." As late as October 31, "MacArthur's headquarters still believed it had every confidence that this plan would remain unchanged" (Reuters, Tokyo). On the same day, the commander of the US invading army's 24th Division, Church, even boasted: "It would be strange if we don't reach the Yalu River tomorrow" (United Press).

　　However, just two days later, these arrogant fellows "experienced their biggest defeat since the major defeat in Belgium during World War II (referring to the major defeat of the Anglo-American forces under the large-scale offensive launched by Hitler's army in the Ardennes on the Western Front in the winter of 1944), having retreated fifty miles in two days. During the retreat, two battalions of American troops were surrounded, and other units attempting to rescue them abandoned the idea on the evening of the 2nd." The rout of the US invading army was so disgraceful that when the People's Army "broke through the defenses around Unsan before dawn, accompanied by cavalry, the 'United Nations forces' were caught off guard in their sleep. Two regiments of soldiers with good combat records had to retreat hastily in chaos to a new defense line nine miles south of Unsan" (United Press, Tokyo, 3rd). Moreover, the US invading army's "cavalry regiment was also surrounded southwest of Unsan, suffering more than half of its personnel as casualties, and losing all its artillery and heavy equipment" (Kuomintang Central News Agency, Seoul, 4th).

　　MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo has begun to despairingly state: "All hope of ending the Korean War soon has been abandoned" (United Press, Tokyo, 3rd). "There has been a sudden change in the morale and atmosphere of most of the American vanguard troops. Just a few days ago, soldiers and officers were planning to spend Thanksgiving in Japan," now, "these plans have faded away." "Most of them are currently facing a bleak future, and will probably have to engage in bone-chilling battles in the harsh winter of North Korea." (International News Service, Tokyo, 4th). It seems that these bandits have not yet realized that an even more dismal fate awaits them.

### 在朝人民军强大反击下  美军狼狈沮丧恐惧  更惨淡的命运在等待着他们

　　在朝人民军强大反击下
    美军狼狈沮丧恐惧
    更惨淡的命运在等待着他们
    【新华社七日讯】朝鲜人民军发动的强大反击，粉碎了美国侵略者妄想“早日结束朝鲜战争”的迷梦，并使美国侵略军队中弥漫着沮丧和恐惧。人民军反击的消息“在美国军队中的第一个反应是闷闷不乐”，而李承晚伪军的“大韩民国第二军团人人愁眉苦脸，没有心绪谈话”。那些在十多天前侵陷平壤时狂妄宣称“下一步就该轮到满洲边境了”的敌军将领们，表现得“深为忧虑，甚至抑郁消沉”（美联社东京十月三十一日电）。
    按照“麦克阿瑟的‘时间表’，规定朝鲜战争在感恩节（十一月二十三日）以前结束”。直至十月三十一日，“麦克阿瑟总部还认为有一切信心相信这个计划将会维持不变”（路透社东京电）。美国侵略军第二十四师师长邱奇在同一天还夸口：“如果我们明天到不了鸭绿江，那才真是怪事”（合众社电）。
    然而，就在两天之后，这些狂妄的家伙“尝到了自第二次世界大战在比利时境内大败仗（按指一九四四年冬希特勒军队在西线阿登纳发动大攻势下美英联军的大溃败）以来最大挫败，已于二日后撤五十英里之远。在撤退时有美军两营被包围，企图前往救援的其他部队亦于二日黄昏放弃了这一想法”。美侵略军的溃败是如此狼狈，当人民军“配以骑兵于黎明前突入云山四周防线时，睡梦中的‘联合国军队’措手不及。两团战绩很好的士兵不得不在混乱中匆匆撤至云山以南九英里的新防线”（合众社东京三日电）。而美侵略军“骑兵一团也在云山西南被围，人员损失过半，大炮和重装备全部丧失”（国民党中央社汉城四日电）。
    在东京的麦克阿瑟总部方面已开始沮丧地表示：“早日结束朝鲜战争的一切希望均已放弃”（合众社东京三日电）。“大部分美国先头部队的精神与气氛发生了突然的变化。几天以前，士兵和军官都计划着到日本度感恩节”，现在，“这些计划都黯然地消失了”。“他们中的大多数目前已面临惨淡的前途，大约要在北朝鲜冬季的严寒中进行冻到刺骨的战斗了。”（国新社东京四日电）。这些匪徒们似乎还没有想到，更惨淡的命运在等待着他们。
