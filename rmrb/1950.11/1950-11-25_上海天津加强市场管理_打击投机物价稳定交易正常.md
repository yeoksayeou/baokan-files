　　Shanghai and Tianjin Strengthen Market Management
    Combat Speculation, Stabilize Prices, and Ensure Normal Transactions
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 22nd: Since October, the relevant departments of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government have strengthened market management and combated speculation, achieving results in stabilizing prices. As of November 15th, market transactions have generally returned to normal.

    After the autumn harvest, some private merchants took the opportunity to speculate, resulting in a widening gap between listed prices and market prices. Taking cotton yarn prices on October 4th as an example: the listed price of state-owned six-count "Golden God of Wealth" yarn from the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, East China District, was 4.92 million yuan, but the market price of inferior "Fishing Boat" yarn off the market was as high as 5.11 million yuan, a difference of 190,000 yuan. This situation persisted for more than 20 days, and as a result, some unscrupulous yarn merchants seized the opportunity to purchase from state-owned companies and then resell the transaction orders, making exorbitant profits of 300,000 to 500,000 yuan per cotton yarn, while processing factories could not buy raw materials. In order to prevent speculation and ensure production, the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, East China District, adopted a direct sales method to various processing factories from October 28th. With the cooperation of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and other relevant parties, the administrative departments for industry and commerce of the People's Government successively issued a decree on November 1st to strictly implement cotton yarn registration, requiring all transactions to be concentrated in the market and executed at standard prices. At the same time, the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, East China District, continuously supplied various types of cotton yarn. As a result of this implementation for half a month, the speculative behavior of some private merchants regarding cotton yarn was curbed, the circulation process of cotton yarn was shortened, and the purchase volume of processing factories accounted for the majority of the total market transaction volume. The sales volume of yarn factories in the market also increased from 18 pieces on October 31st to more than 100 pieces on November 2nd, beginning to return to normal.

    During the same period, some private merchants also engaged in competitive purchasing in the coal and pork markets. After the state-owned Shanghai Coal Company and Native Produce Company supplied large quantities of goods, and the administrative departments for industry and commerce, public security, and other relevant departments of the People's Government, with the assistance of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, exposed and cracked down on some speculators, the prices of the aforementioned commodities have now stopped rising and have fallen back.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 23rd: Tianjin has strengthened the management of the grain, cotton yarn, petroleum, and coal markets, and cracked down on the speculative activities of unscrupulous merchants, achieving significant results.

    Recently, a small number of private merchants in Tianjin attempted to hoard and drive up prices in order to obtain exorbitant profits, resulting in grain, yarn, coal, and petroleum transactions exceeding normal supply and sales volumes since late October, and illegal off-market transactions were rampant. In order to resolutely implement the policy of stabilizing prices, the Tianjin Municipal Administrative Department for Industry and Commerce and state-owned trade swiftly strengthened material allocation, increased the production volume of standard yarn (20-count yarn), and vigorously sold it. At the same time, two measures to strengthen market management were promulgated: First, all cotton yarn needed by the Northeast and Hebei provinces, and mineral oil (including kerosene, gasoline, diesel oil, and lubricating oil) needed by the East China and Central South regions, should be allocated uniformly by the Tianjin trade departments, and the transportation of goods by merchants should be suspended; secondly, wholesale transactions of grain, cotton yarn, and mineral oil should be conducted exclusively in legal markets, and illegal off-market transactions should be prohibited. Factories in the city should also be supplied with yarn from the market according to their needs, and resale is strictly prohibited. With the cooperative exposure by public security, customs, and other relevant departments, and legitimate merchants, the administrative departments for industry and commerce have uncovered multiple cases of illegal operations in the past ten days and handed them over to the Tianjin Municipal People's Court for legal processing. At the same time, the Tianjin branches of the State Bank froze the funds of state-owned enterprises before November 5th, stopped State Bank loans, and tightened monetary policy in a timely manner.

    The implementation of the above measures curbed the illegal activities of speculators, the transaction volume of goods such as yarn, grain, coal, and petroleum returned to normal, illegal off-market transactions basically stopped, and prices also fell back to the listed price level, allowing legitimate operators to operate with peace of mind. The sales volume of major commodities such as yarn, coal, grain, and petroleum in the Tianjin market decreased by three to five times, returning to a normal state. The materials allocated to various regions are also controlled by the local state-owned trading companies to stabilize local prices and narrow the difference between the local market and the Tianjin market, which has also affected the decline in yarn prices in Shenyang City in the Northeast.

    At the same time, the Tianjin Municipal Administrative Department for Industry and Commerce, in cooperation with the Federation of Industry and Commerce, convened a conference of industrialists and businessmen, combining it with current affairs education to explain the government's policy of stabilizing prices, which further ensured that the above measures received the support of the vast majority of merchants and the public.

　　上海天津加强市场管理
    打击投机物价稳定交易正常
    【新华社上海二十二日电】十月以来，上海市人民政府主管部门加强市场管理，打击投机，稳定物价已获成效；至十一月十五日止，市场交易已趋正常。
    秋收后，某些私商乘隙投机，以致牌价与市价间差距日益扩大。以十月四日纱价为例：中国花纱布公司华东区公司公营六支金财神纱牌价四百九十二万元，但品质较劣的渔船场外市价却达五百十一万元，相差十九万元。这一情况延续了二十多天，结果部分不法纱商更乘机向国营公司套购，然后向外转售成交单，每件棉纱获取暴利三、五十万元不等，而复制厂商却买不到原料。为了防止投机、保障生产，中国花纱布公司华东区公司自十月二十八日起对各复制厂采用直接发售办法。人民政府工商行政部门在市工商联等有关方面配合下，更相继于十一月一日起明令严格实行棉纱登记，一切交易集中市场进行，执行标准价格；同时，中国花纱布公司华东区公司则源源供应各种棉纱。这样实行半月的结果，制止了某些私商对于棉纱的投机行为，缩短了棉纱流通过程，使复制厂的购纱数量占达市场成交总量中的大半。市场纱厂售纱成交量也由十月三十一日的十八件，增至十一月二日的一百多件，开始趋于正常。
    与上述同一期间，某些私商也曾在煤和猪肉等商品市场进行竞购，经在国营上海市煤业公司和土产公司大量供应，人民政府工商、公安等主管部门和市工商联协力检举和取缔了一些投机分子后，上述商品现亦止涨回跌。
    【新华社天津二十三日电】天津市加强对粮食、棉纱、石油和煤市的管理，打击奸商的投机活动，已获显著效果。
    最近以来，天津市少数私商妄图囤积、哄抬，获取暴利，因此形成十月下旬以来粮食、纱布、煤、石油等成交量超出正常的供销量，市场以外的非法交易蠢动。天津市工商行政部门和国营贸易为坚决贯彻稳定物价的政策，迅即加强物资调拨，增加标准纱（二十支纱）的生产量，大力抛售；同时又颁行加强市场管理的两项办法，即：凡是东北及河北省所需棉纱、华东及中南区所需矿物油（包括煤油、汽油、柴油、滑润油），都由津市贸易部门统一调拨，商贩贩运暂停；其次，粮食、花纱布及矿物油的批发交易一律在法定市场内成交，禁止场外非法交易，市内各工厂用纱亦由场内按需要量供应，严禁倒卖。工商行政部门并在公安、海关等有关部门和正当商民的协力检举下，一旬来已查出违法经营案多起，交由津市人民法院依法处理。与此同时，国家银行在津各分行又冻结了国营企业十一月五日以前的资金，停止国家银行贷款，及时抽紧银根。
    上述措施的实施，制止了投机商人的不法活动，纱布、粮食、煤、石油等商品的成交量恢复至正常状态，场外非法交易基本停止，价格也回降至牌价水平，使正当经营者安心经营。天津市场纱布、煤、粮、石油等主要商品的销量减少了三倍到五倍，回复正常状态。而调拨到各地的物资，也由各该地国家贸易公司掌握当地物价，缩小当地与津市的差额，也因之影响到东北区沈阳市纱价目前已开始下降。
    与此同时，津市工商行政部门又在工商联合会配合下，召开了工商业者大会，结合时事教育，说明政府稳定物价的政策，因之更使得以上措施获得了广大商民的拥护。
