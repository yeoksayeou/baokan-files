Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing: According to incomplete statistics, the People's Armed Forces of the Southwest Military Region have developed to nearly 500,000 people. The establishment of people's armed forces in various places initially started in a scattered manner under the slogan of "defending against bandits and self-defense," and developed among organized peasant masses after July of this year. The militiamen in the Mianyang Special District of western Sichuan account for one-third of the total number of members of the district's peasant associations. Most of these members have undergone preliminary review by the peasant associations and are young, strong peasants with considerable political consciousness.

The People's Armed Forces in various places have powerfully cooperated with the People's Liberation Army in suppressing bandits. In Lushan County, Xikang Province, there are 32 bandit prevention and self-defense groups in six townships. The public security groups in Meitan County, Guizhou Province, actively conduct patrols, protect power lines, and guard warehouses, and cooperate with the bandit suppression troops to annihilate more than 2,500 bandits. Fu Qijiang, a member of the Zhenxing Township Peasant Self-Defense Force in Huayang County, western Sichuan, known for his bravery, once charged into the enemy ranks alone after being wounded in battle and killed a bandit leader. The People's Armed Forces in many places also actively assisted the people's government in suppressing illegal activities by unscrupulous landlords, such as illegally seizing tenants.

Currently, various parts of Southwest China are establishing specialized agencies for the unified leadership of the People's Armed Forces to reorganize the organization, review the composition of members, purge bad elements such as local bullies and landlords who have infiltrated the People's Armed Forces, absorb active members from peasant associations as leading backbone forces, and strengthen policy and discipline education for the People's Armed Forces.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 17th: The People's Armed Forces in Shanxi Province have made great progress in the past year. At present, the province has 373,250 militiamen, of whom 77,922 are core militiamen.

Militiamen in various places actively assist local public security organs in capturing secret agents and scattered bandits. According to incomplete statistics, from January to July of this year, militiamen across the province uncovered 105 cases involving secret agents and scattered bandits. Militiamen in the second district of Fenxi County once penetrated bandit dens to arrest four bandits and seized ten light machine guns and twenty-one rifles, effectively打击(dǎ jī:punish,hit) the activities of secret agents and surviving scattered bandits.

Militiamen in various places also actively protect national construction efforts such as railways, highways, factories, mines, and warehouses. In villages within five miles of the railway in the Yuci, Xinzhou, Linfen, and Yuncheng military sub-districts, organizations have been established with militiamen as the core to protect railway power lines, and they regularly conduct road patrols and line inspections. In Yuncheng sub-district, 2,210 militiamen from 139 administrative villages in seven counties participated in the road protection groups in their respective areas.

In the great production movement, militiamen not only actively complete their own production tasks but also lead the masses in safeguarding production. During the summer and autumn harvests, protection organizations with militiamen as the backbone were generally established in various places, and after democratic discussion, covenants for protecting production and field protection discipline were formulated, thereby abolishing the long-standing system of hiring field patrols in most areas. Militiamen in mountainous areas launched activities to combat mountain pests. In July, militiamen in fifty villages in three counties, including Licheng, killed more than 37,000 wild animals such as wolves, foxes, badgers, and wild boars. Militiamen also improved their shooting skills in the activities of fighting mountain pests.

Currently, militiamen across the province are preparing to carry out winter training, consolidate their organizations, and conduct ideological education on patriotism in order to better shoulder the task of resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending our homes and country.

　　西南人民武装发展近五十万
    山西省已有民兵三十七万余名
    【新华社重庆电】据不完全统计，西南军区人民武装已发展到近五十万人。各地人民武装开始多在“防匪自卫”的口号下分散地建立起来，今年七月以后便在有组织的农民群众中发展。川西区绵阳专区的民兵即占该区农民协会会员总数的三分之一。这些成员大部经过农民协会的初步审查，是年青力壮、具有相当政治觉悟的农民。
    各地人民武装有力地配合人民解放军清剿土匪。西康省芦山县六个乡即有三十二个防匪自卫小组。贵州省湄潭县各地治安小组，积极进行巡查放哨，保护电线和看守仓库，并配合剿匪部队歼匪二千五百多名。川西区华阳县以英勇著称的正兴乡农民自卫队队员傅启江，曾在作战负伤后只身冲入敌阵，击毙匪首。许多地方的人民武装并积极地协助人民政府镇压不法地主非法夺佃等破坏活动。
    目前西南各地正建立统一领导人民武装的专门机构进行整理组织，审查队员成份，清洗混入人民武装中的恶霸、地主等不良分子，吸收农会中的积极分子为领导骨干，并加强人民武装的政策纪律教育。
    【新华社太原十七日电】山西省人民武装一年来有很大发展。目前全省已有民兵三十七万三千二百五十人，其中基干民兵占七万七千九百二十二人。
    各地民兵积极协助当地公安机关捕捉特务、散匪。据不完全统计：今年一月至七月，全省民兵即破获特务、散匪案件一百零五起。汾西县二区民兵曾深入匪穴逮捕匪徒四人，缴获轻机枪十挺，步枪二十一支，有力地打击了特务及残存的零星散匪的活动。
    各地民兵并积极保护铁路、公路、工厂、矿山、仓库等国家建设。榆次、忻县、临汾、运城四个军分区沿铁路五里以内的村庄，大部已以民兵为核心建立起保护铁路电线的组织，经常进行巡路查线工作。运城分区七个县一百三十九个行政村，就有民兵二千二百一十人参加了所在地区的护路小组。
    民兵在大生产运动中，除积极完成自己的生产外，并带领群众保卫生产。各地在夏收秋收中普遍地建立了以民兵为骨干的护田组织，并经过民主讨论，订立了保卫生产公约和护田纪律，因而在大部地区废除了多年来的雇佣巡田制。靠山地区的民兵展开了打山害活动。黎城等三县五十个村的民兵，在七月份即打死狼、狐、獾、山猪等野兽三万七千多只。民兵并在打山害活动中提高了射击技术。
    目前全省民兵正准备开展冬季整训，整顿组织并进行爱国主义的思想教育，以便更好地担负起抗美援朝、保家卫国的任务。
