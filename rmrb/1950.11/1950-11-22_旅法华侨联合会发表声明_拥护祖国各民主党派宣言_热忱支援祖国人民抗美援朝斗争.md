　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 21st: The Overseas Chinese Federation in France issued a statement on the 12th, supporting the joint declaration of the democratic parties in the motherland. The full text of the statement is as follows: "American imperialism has already brought the flames of war to our country's borders, directly threatening our country's security. The American imperialist's naval and air forces invading Korea have repeatedly violated our country's territorial waters and airspace, slaughtering our people. The Overseas Chinese in France, far away overseas, feel boundless anger. The Chinese people, after a hundred years of arduous struggle, have won the victory of people's liberation, and cannot tolerate the imperialists' aggression. American imperialists are walking the old road of Japanese imperialism in the past, and will surely suffer the same fate of destruction as Japanese imperialism. The Overseas Chinese in France enthusiastically support the joint declaration of the democratic parties in the motherland and actively support the motherland's people's struggle to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country."
