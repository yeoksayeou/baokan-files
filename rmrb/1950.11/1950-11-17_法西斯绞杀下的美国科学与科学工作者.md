American Science and Scientists Under Fascist Strangulation
    Ping Yuan
    When the American fascist Thomas-Rankin Committee was shamelessly fabricating the so-called "Hollywood Case," Dalton Trumbo, a famous American screenwriter who was being interrogated, described to all the American people and the people of the world that the American social system and national system had become a "damnable and stinking system." He indignantly declared: "Washington has become such a city that no union leader can trust his telephone there; old friends dare not greet each other in public places; men and women are only afraid of being eavesdropped on when they speak in moving cars or in open places. Our capital now reminds people of the German capital on the eve of the Reichstag fire, and those who remember the German history of the autumn of 1932 smell the smoke of this place again."
    What Dalton said was still in 1947. Now, the American people have not only smelled this fascist smoke, but have long seen the flames of burning democracy, and these flames have burned on every American people.
    American science and scientists are no exception, suffering in this fascist flame. Just a few readily available examples can give one an idea of how American militarists are strangling American science and scientists with a sense of justice.

    The Scientists’ Predicament

    The fact that the American reactionary government unreasonably detained our scientists Qian Xuesen, Zhao Zhongyao, and our Chinese students studying in the United States is already well known. Let us look at the fascist persecution suffered by American scientists:
    The American magazine "The Nation" has reported a series of cases of American police dealing with scientific workers suspected of "rebellion." Many scientists have been rudely pushed out of their work departments in government agencies and private enterprises, and they are not even allowed to have the right to inquire. A well-known American biologist who worked in an important scientific department of a military agency for less than three months received an order to "hand over" within 24 hours. Several weeks later, this scientist learned in Washington the reason for his dismissal. The reason was that a representative of a "security agency" believed that this scientist had "dangerous relationships" because this scientist often subsidized the Joint Committee for Assisting Anti-Fascist Exiles.
    In addition, two physicists (a married couple) left the American "General Electric Company" to participate in the experimental work of the Atomic Energy Commission, but after running around for eight months, they did not get this experimental work because they could not get a "loyalty certificate." Why couldn't they find a "loyalty certificate"? According to the explanation of the so-called "American Federation of Scientists": the "loyalty certificate" was not issued to these two scientific workers because the husband expressed his support for the workers' strike against the "General Electric Company" in 1946. (From this statement, we can also see the relationship between the so-called "American Federation of Scientists" and the "General Electric Company.")
    Not long ago, Professor Spitz of the University of Oregon in the United States was dismissed from his professorship because he advocated that Lysenko's biological works should at least be read by students.
    The above are just a few of the thousands of scientists who have been persecuted in the so-called "democratic America." On the other hand, we can see the arrogant behavior of Wall Street's henchmen in the American scientific community.
    In the autumn of 1948, shocking news spread across the country. American fascists and bogus scientists, such as the low-energy biochemist Kurt Lewin, shouted out the "proposal to draft an ideological control agency." Lewin openly and shamelessly said: With the help of this agency, it is possible to "analyze and control the infectious diseases of communism" and "establish a sound reason to make this misfortune impossible."
    Schilard of the University of Chicago, an accomplice of the war mongers, openly broadcast, clamoring that science serves war. He absurdly said: "I have calculated... how many 'neutrons' or 'heavy hydrogen' do we need to kill everyone on earth with this special method? I calculated that fifty tons of 'neutrons' are enough to kill all mankind, in other words, about five hundred tons of heavy hydrogen are needed."
    These few reactionary scientific workers and war mongers in the United States shouted to kill people, shouted to replace "morality" with killing. They said: "We can immediately deal with 'moral' debates. Once it is decided to kill people, all 'moral' problems will be solved; the tools of killing (referring to science) have nothing to do with humanitarian or moral issues at all."
    In the fascist America ruled by the fascist American rulers, who use "loyalty oaths," "non-communist affidavits," and "political assessments" and other fascist laws to cruelly rule, scientists with a sense of justice have nowhere to go, suffering persecution everywhere. Only those scientific scum like Lewin who serve bloody rule and cruel war mongers can stand in the United States.

    The Degeneration of "Science"

    It is no wonder that even the world-renowned great scientist Albert Einstein, as well as famous American scientists, educators, and so on, in their joint report "The Militarization of the United States," called out against the American rulers for imposing fascist shackles on American science and scientific workers. The report pointed out: American science has been tied to the chariot, and scientific research can only be supported by the American government when it meets military needs. The money bag is in the hands of the US Department of Defense, the research funds are paid from military expenditures, and of course the management rights are also in the hands of the military. Scientific institutions have become affiliated departments of military agencies. According to statistics, as early as 1946, the money spent by the American fascist military-ruled scientific research institutes reached 280 million US dollars. In 1947, the US Army and Navy alone spent 96 million US dollars on military research at universities.
    American science is no longer for the benefit of mankind, but is specialized in manufacturing tools such as atomic, bacterial, and chemical weapons to destroy world civilization and progress. It is all controlled by the American fascist military. For example, the Scientific Research and Development Bureau is an institution that rules American science. As far as we know, its leaders are notorious fascists, such as General Karl A. Spaatz, General Jacob L. Danforth, Undersecretary of the Navy W. Kinner, Deputy Chief of Naval Operations Admiral C. Ramsey, and so on.
    Many nationally important scientific organizations or science-related organizations in the United States are also controlled by American soldiers and fascists. For example, the "University Fund Donation Committee" is controlled by the Naval Research Office, and the US House of Representatives passed a law: "Anyone who has not been investigated by the FBI shall not be hired by the Foundation ('National Science Foundation'), and the Foundation shall not grant degrees..."
    Under these reactionary laws and the rule of fascists, American science is naturally not for the happiness of mankind, but has degenerated to seeking death for mankind. Rospoel, a biologist who presided over the US military's infectious disease program during World War II, revealed the truth about this perverse science in the United States very clearly. He said: "If you want to understand BW (i.e., biological warfare), you must metaphorically remember in your mind that BW is a science of destruction, a perversion of nature. Normally speaking, we study diseases to prevent or treat them. This is the normality of bacteriology. But BW is to produce diseases. It is not normal and natural, but abnormal and artificial." Now American science is this kind of abnormal, perverse, and degenerate science.
    This kind of science and its system has greatly hindered its development. A special committee pushed away by the board of directors of the American Atomic Energy Science Association said: "Keeping secrets endangers both science and democracy."
    This naturally led to the withdrawal of scientific workers with normal consciousness from that perverse scientific work. Professor Olay once said: "The progress of my post-war atomic research cannot be compared with the progress during the war in any way... Most famous figures and many excellent young people have abandoned various plans and returned to university jobs." He also believes that this is mainly related to the "secrecy and loyalty inspection" of the American fascist rule.
    As early as 1947, a professor at Cornell University, who studied atomic energy at the Chicago Laboratory and Los Alamos Laboratory of the Manhattan Project, published an article in "The American Scholar" magazine, opposing the American military's rule over science. He said: "If science is bound by the military, we must not hope that it will be used for peace again. Moreover, science needs the assistance of society. It must obtain this assistance in the name and right of research itself, and it cannot borrow the name of weapons of war... In our world that yearns for peace, science must once again pursue truth for all mankind, not just for Americans. If it is narrow, national, and secret, it cannot achieve the above goals; if it is regarded as an ardent weapon supplier for a new and more brutal war, it cannot achieve the above goals."
    It is shameful that the American war mongers did not act according to Professor Morrison's "hope." Now, in the United States, science has degenerated into a science that hinders human progress and destroys human civilization. American scientists are either tied to the chariot or imprisoned in the fascist concentration camps of the "Un-American Activities Committee."

　　法西斯绞杀下的美国科学与科学工作者
    平原
    当美国法西斯的汤姆斯——伦金委员会在无耻地制造所谓“好莱坞案件”的时候，被审讯的美国名电影剧作家道尔敦·特伦波曾经向全美国人民和全世界人民描述过美国社会制度和国家制度已经成为了一个“可诅咒的腥臭的制度”，他曾极度愤慨地宣布：“华盛顿变成了这样的城市，那儿没有一位职工会的领袖能相信自己的电话；那儿的老朋友们不敢在公共场所互相招呼；那儿的男男女女只有在行驶的汽车中、或露天的地方说话才不怕被人偷听。我们的首都，现在使人想起国会纵火前夜的德国首都，而那些记得起一九三二年秋天的德国历史的人们，又闻到了这地方的烟味。”
    道尔敦所说的话还是一九四七年的事，如今，美国人民不仅闻到了这种法西斯的烟味，而且早已看到了这种焚烧民主的火焰，这火焰已烧到了每一个美国人民的身上。
    美国的科学和科学家们也便是毫不例外地在这种法西斯的火焰中受着煎熬。举几个顺手拈来的例子，便可以令人想见美国军国主义者在如何绞杀美国的科学和有正义感的科学家了。
    科学家的厄运
    美国反动政府无理扣留我国科学家钱学森、赵忠尧和我国的留美学生的事实已是大家所熟知的了，且让我们看看美国的科学家遭受的法西斯迫害：
    美国《民族》杂志，曾一连串地报道过美国警察对付所谓有“叛乱”嫌疑的科学工作者，许多科学家都给蛮横地推出于政府机关和私人企业的工作部门之外，甚至不许他们有询问的权利。一位著名的美国生物学家，他在一个军事机关的重要科学部门工作了不到三个月，便接到了限定在二十四小时内“办理移交”的命令。几个星期之后，这位科学家才在华盛顿得知他被解雇的理由。原因是一位“保安机关”的代表，认为这位科学家有“危险的关系”，因为这位科学家时常资助援助反法西斯流亡者联合委员会。
    另外有两位物理学家（夫妇两人），离开了美国“通用电气公司”，要参加原子能委员会的实验工作，但他们奔走了八个月，却因为弄不到“忠实保证书”，而并没有得到这个实验工作。为什么他们找不到“忠实保证书”呢？根据所谓“美国科学家联合会”的解释说：不发“忠实保证书”给这两位科学工作者，是因为那位做丈夫的在一九四六年表示支持工人罢工，反对“通用电气公司”。（从这个声明中，我们也可以看出所谓“美国科学家联合会”与“通用电气公司”的关系了。）
    不久以前，美国奥勒冈大学史彼泽教授，因为他主张李森科的生物学作品至少应该让学生阅读，而被解除了教授的职务。
    以上，这仅是在所谓“民主美国”遭受迫害成千成万科学家中的几个。然而另一方面，我们又可以看出华尔街的御用匪徒们，在美国科学界中的狂妄行为。
    一九四八年的秋天，一个骇人听闻的消息传遍全国，美国法西斯分子，冒牌科学家如低能的生物化学家库尔特·莱昂叫喊出了“建议草拟思想统制机构”，莱昂公开无耻地说：靠着这种机构的帮助，就可以“分析并控制共产主义的传染病”和“建立健全的理智，使这种不幸成为不可能”。
    战争贩子的帮凶——芝加哥大学的席拉德，公开广播，叫嚣科学服务战争，他曾荒诞地说：“我算了一下……用这个特别的方法我们要有多少‘中子’或是‘重氢’才能炸死地球上每一个人呢？我算出来五十吨‘中子’足够把人类杀光，换句话说，约略需要五百吨的重氢。”
    美国这些少数反动的科学工作者们和战争贩子们一样，高喊杀人，高喊用杀人代替“道德”，他们说：“我们可以立刻处理‘道德’上的辩论，一决定应该杀人之后，‘道德’问题便全部解决；杀人的工具（按指科学）根本与人道或道德的问题无关。”
    在法西斯的美国统治者，利用“忠诚令”，“非共具结”，“政治考核”等法西斯法令，残酷地统治着的美国，有正义感的科学家们，更是走头无路，到处遭受迫害，而只有像莱昂这一类为血腥的统治、为残酷的战争贩子们服务的科学界的败类，才可以在美国立脚。
    “科学”的堕落
    这就无怪乎，连闻名世界的大科学家＾·爱因斯坦，以及著名的美国科学家、教育家等等在他们共同发表的《美国的军国主义化》的报告中，高呼反对美国统治者将法西斯的枷锁加在美国科学和科学工作者的身上。在这个报告中，曾这样指出：美国科学已经被拴在战车上了，科学的研究只有合于军事需要时，才能得到美国政府的支持。钱袋握在美国国防部手里，研究费由军费中支出，当然管理权也在军部的手里。科学机关，已经成了军事机关的附属部门。据统计，远在一九四六年，美国法西斯军人统治的科学研究所花费的钱即达二亿八千万美元。在一九四七年，美国陆海军单单用在各大学的军事目的研究费，即达九千六百万元。
    美国的科学，已不是在为人类谋福利，而是专门在为制造原子、细菌、化学等破坏世界文明和进步的工具上了，它全被控制在美国法西斯军人的手里，例如科学研究与发展局，便是统治美国科学的一个机构，其中的领导人，据我们所知都是些臭名卓著的法西斯分子，如卡尔·Ａ·史巴兹将军，雅谷勃·Ｌ·但佛斯将军，海军部次长Ｗ·凯纳，海军作战部副部长Ｃ·雷姆赛海军大将等。
    美国的许多全国性重要的科学团体或与研究科学有关的团体，也都控制在美国军人和法西斯分子的手里，例如“大学基金捐献委员会”，为海军研究处所控制，而美国众议院通过法律：“凡是未经联邦调查局调查过的人，基金会（‘全国科学基金会’）一律不得聘用，基金会并不得赠予以学位……”
    在这些反动法律与法西斯分子统治下的美国科学，自然不是在为人类谋幸福，而是堕落到为人类谋死亡了。对于美国这种倒行逆施的科学，曾经在二次大战中主持过美军传染病计划的生物学家罗斯波莱揭穿得很清楚，他说：“如果你要了解Ｂ·Ｗ·（即生物战争），你必须譬喻似的，在脑中记住，Ｂ·Ｗ·是一种毁灭的科学，是自然界的倒行逆施。正常说来，我们研究疾病是为防止它或是治疗它。这是细菌学的正态。但是Ｂ·Ｗ·却是产生疾病。它不是正常与自然的，而是变态与矫作的。”现在美国的科学便是这种变态的，倒行逆施的堕落科学。
    这种科学及其制度，便大大地阻止了它的发展。美国原子能科学协会干事会推远的一个特别委员会，曾说：“保持秘密既危害科学，也危害民主。”
    这就自然而然地使那些有正常意识的科学工作者，纷纷退出了那种倒行逆施的科学工作。有一位欧莱教授曾说：“我战后原子研究的进步，从哪一方面说都不能和战时的进步相比……多数著名的人物以及许多优秀的青年人物，已经舍弃种种计划回到大学工作岗位去了。”他并认为这与美国法西斯统治的“秘密与忠贞检查”等有主要关系。
    早在一九四七年，在孟哈顿计划的芝加哥实验室和洛斯阿拉莫斯实验室研究原子能的康几尔大学教授，即曾在《美国学者》杂志发表文章，反对美国军人统治科学，他说：“如果科学受了军人的束缚，我们必不能希望它再用于和平。而且，科学需要社会的协助。它必须以研究的本身的名义和权利去获得这种协助，不能假借战争武器的名义……在我们那渴望和平的世界里，科学必须再度为全人类追求真理，而不只为美国人。如果它是狭隘的、国家的、和秘密的，它就不能实现上述的目标；如果它被视为一项新的更残酷的战争的热诚的武器供给者，它就不能实现上述目标。”
    可耻的是，美国战争贩子们，并没有如摩立逊教授这种“希望”去作，如今在美国，科学已堕落成了阻止人类进步的科学，破坏人类文明的科学。美国科学家不是被拴上了战车，便是被囚禁在“非美活动委员会”的法西斯集中营里了。
