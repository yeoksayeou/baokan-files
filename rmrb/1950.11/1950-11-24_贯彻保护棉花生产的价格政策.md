　　Implement Price Policies to Protect Cotton Production

　　(I)
　　Economic protection policies for cotton cultivation are of vital importance to the restoration and development of cotton production. China is one of the world's largest countries suitable for cotton growth. Although cotton cultivation has a long history, it has never been developed due to the heavy oppression and cruel exploitation by imperialist bureaucratic capital and feudal landlords. The raw cotton and cloth market was controlled by imperialism, and farmers regarded cotton cultivation as a "gamble"; if the market price was good, a year's labor might yield some return; if the price was bad, they would starve from planting cotton. In concentrated cotton-producing areas, there were constant famines during good harvests. Therefore, farmers were not interested in planting cotton. Only landlords and rich peasants with storage capacity and able to wait for better prices dared to grow cotton. Before liberation, the larger share of cotton cultivation area was occupied by landlords and rich peasants. Middle and poor peasants did not dare to plant cotton on their small plots of land rented at high rents and interest rates because cotton prices were not guaranteed.
　　Imperialist countries such as the United States, Britain, and Japan exploited China's cheap labor by opening yarn factories in China and dumping yarn and cloth, especially the United States, which dumped a large amount of raw cotton. In 1946 alone, 6.89 million dan of foreign cotton poured into the Chinese market along with US aid, accounting for 92.7% of China's total cotton production of 7.43 million dan that year. Furthermore, they colluded with bureaucratic capital to implement reactionary measures such as price-limited purchases in China's major cotton-producing areas, monopolizing the cotton market and severely strangling China's cotton production.

　　(II)
　　After the national liberation, the restoration and development of cotton production has been advancing by leaps and bounds. Especially in 1950, the total cotton planting area in the country rapidly expanded from 39.3 million mu in 1949 to 56.75 million mu, an increase of 42%: lint cotton production increased from 9.07 million dan in 1949 to 14.2 million dan, an increase of more than 56%; compared with the average output of more than 12 million dan in the five years from 1933 to 1937 before the War of Resistance Against Japan, it has also exceeded 2 million dan. The yield per unit area has also generally increased: in the Si Zi Er B cotton area of Hebei, the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City can harvest 230 jin per mu, and Jin County, Linqing, Xiazhen, Qiu County and other places can harvest 130 jin per mu. Individual cotton-growing model farmers, such as Xu Laomo in Beipengjia Village, Jin County, Hebei Province, can achieve a yield of up to 600 jin of seed cotton per mu. These are unprecedented phenomena in Chinese history, pointing to an extremely bright future for cotton production in the new China.
　　Such a leap forward in exciting development is, of course, primarily due to the land reform in the old liberated areas and the rent reduction and refund in the new liberated areas. The broad masses of farmers have obtained the means of production and livelihood, land, plows, and agricultural tools, breaking free from the shackles of feudalism for thousands of years. With high enthusiasm, and with the help of the state, they have engaged in selfless labor. It should also be particularly pointed out that this is the result of the correct price policy guarantee given to the people by our People's Government. In 1949, in the liberated North China region, the North China People's Government announced a ratio of 8 jin of millet for 1 jin of lint cotton. Under the extremely difficult circumstances that major cities had not yet been liberated, the People's Liberation Army was still carrying out large-scale operations, transportation had not fully recovered, and prices had not stabilized, especially with the continuous rise in grain prices, our state-owned trading companies carried out very arduous work, implemented the guarantee given to farmers by the government, and supplied cotton-producing areas with large quantities of food, fuel, and general merchandise. In 1950, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council announced the ratio of cotton to major food crops in various cotton-producing areas throughout the country. This enabled millions of cotton-growing farmers to expand the cotton planting area based on their practical experience and unlimited trust in the People's Government, and to apply more fertilizer to the cotton fields, pay more labor, and increase the yield per unit area.
　　The above-mentioned important experience has also been confirmed by our great neighbor, the Soviet Union. When the Tsarist government was overthrown and the Soviet government was just established, it attached importance to "increasing the cotton to ensure Russia's textile industry." (Lenin's words) On November 2, 1920, the order signed by Lenin stated: "According to the contract conditions, cotton is exchanged to supply the people with food and daily necessities." In order to regulate the food supply in the cotton-producing areas, the Cotton Industry Administration organized a large-scale "Asia Grain Joint Stock Company" in 1926. During this period, a series of policies were implemented, including guaranteeing reasonable prices for cotton, tax-free rewards, and signing pre-purchase contracts, which had a very positive effect on the restoration of cotton planting areas. On December 23, 1934, the Labor and Defense Committee also passed a decision to increase the average purchase price of cotton by four times. Before the spring plowing in 1935, the new price was announced to the collective farms, and in accordance with Comrade Stalin's instructions, an excess production bonus system for cotton production was established, which had a good impact on increasing the yield per unit area, prompting many collective farms to achieve an average yield of 30 quintals of cotton per hectare.

　　(III)
　　Regarding the implementation of the policy of guaranteeing reasonable cotton prices this year, the general situation is good at present, and the interests of cotton farmers are basically guaranteed. State-owned cotton, yarn, and cloth companies, grain companies, and department stores are all cooperating and working hard to earnestly implement the established policies of the Central People's Government. However, there are also the following issues that must be seriously improved:
　　First, farmers in concentrated cotton-producing areas universally reflect that the cotton-grain ratio is sometimes lower than the price announced by the government. According to the summary of materials from the Shanghai Joint Weighing Office, the cotton-grain ratio in several large and medium-sized cities in concentrated cotton-producing areas in October is shown in the following table:
　　City Name	Cotton Price (Yuan)	Grain Price (Yuan)	Ratio (Times)
　　Baoding	7533	946	7.96
　　Shijiazhuang	7300	913	8.00
　　Taiyuan	7100	840	8.45
　　Xinxiang	7080	861	8.22
　　Tangshan	7900	1096	7.21
　　Hangzhou	7666	1627	4.71
　　Nanjing	8083	1003	8.05
　　Jinan	7700	950	8.11
　　Hankou	7223	871	8.29
　　Changsha	7500	812	9.24
　　Zhengzhou	7241	968	7.48
　　Xi'an	6966	843	8.26

　　Note: (1) Cotton prices are for 7/8 inch mid-grade standard lint cotton. (2) Grain is Erji rice in Hankou, wheat in Jinan, Zhengzhou, and Xi'an, rice in other southern cities, and millet in northern cities. (3) Unit is Jin Yuan. (4) The ratio is the number of Jin of grain that can be exchanged for one Jin of lint cotton.

　　From the figures in the above table, although the cotton-grain ratio in most areas meets the announced price standard, and only a few areas fail to reach it, we cannot conclude that a reasonable guarantee has been achieved, because the above table shows the prices of large and medium-sized cities, while the market where farmers directly sell cotton is mostly in county towns and market towns, or even rural areas. Therefore, this price actually includes a certain amount of freight and the profits of tens of thousands of small vendors. Although grain prices in county towns and market towns are lower than those listed in the above table, the difference between the two is not entirely consistent. In general, grain prices in concentrated cotton-producing areas are always higher, sometimes even higher than the prices in nearby cities. This can be seen from the difference between the cotton prices in the county towns and market towns around Tangshan and the cotton prices in the Tangshan market in late September. According to a survey on September 26, the cotton prices in Xiaoji, Leting, Yutian, Zunhua, Fengrun, Luannan, Changli, Funing, Lulong, and Qian'an and other places around Tangshan differed from Tangshan by 5%-7.8%.

　　Second, before September, there was a period of time when the phenomenon of high cotton prices, with one jin of lint cotton equivalent to 20 jin of millet, appeared in many markets. For example, in late August, Taiyuan exchanged one jin of cotton for 12 jin of wheat, Linfen once rose to one jin of cotton exchanging for one dou of wheat, and in Ningwu, Shangdang, and Qin County, one jin of cotton exchanged for 22 to 28 jin of rice. The formation of this phenomenon is mainly due to the temporary seasonal phenomenon that new cotton has not yet been launched on the market in large quantities, and old cotton is about to be sold out. Therefore, from late September, especially after October, when new cotton was launched on the market in large quantities, cotton prices gradually dropped to the standard ratio, or even lower than the standard ratio. Another situation is that in many areas, the market price is higher than the price of state-owned cotton, yarn, and cloth companies. The comparative statistics of the difference between the listed prices and market prices in several major raw cotton markets in October are shown in the following table:
　　Place Name	Listed Price (Yuan)	Market Price (Yuan)	Market Price vs. Listed Price
　　Baoding	7.533	7.533
　　Shijiazhuang	7.300	7.300
　　Taiyuan	7.100	7.366	103.7
　　Xinxiang	7.080	7.550	106.6
　　Hangzhou	7.410	7.683	103.7
　　Jinan	7.700	8.091	105.1
　　Zhengzhou	7.241	7.517	103.8
　　Xi'an	6.966	7.066	101.4

　　The formation of this situation is mainly due to the slight increase in cotton yarn prices in recent months. Taking Tianjin as an example, the price of each piece of yarn in October increased by 5.49% compared with September, while Shijiazhuang increased by 7.9%, and Tangshan increased by 8.65%.
　　Due to the increase in textile profits, especially in inland cities, private industrial and commercial enterprises are afraid of raw material difficulties, so they purchase at prices slightly higher than the listed prices. Another situation is that this year's cotton harvest is good, and the ginning percentage of seed cotton is generally high. Purchasing seed cotton directly is not disadvantageous even if the price is slightly higher. This is also the reason why the listed price is lower than the market price.
　　Third, another reflection from the broad masses of cotton farmers is that the grading in the purchase is sometimes not very appropriate, so that the superior cotton of farmers cannot get a superior price, thereby affecting the implementation of a reasonable ratio. This is because private merchants try to deceive the people and lower the grade in order to seek high profits, while state-owned cotton, yarn, and cloth companies are mainly due to the lack of experience of grading and inspection personnel, and at the same time, there is some fear of losing money, so they adopt the practice of rather low than high, which damages the interests of farmers. From the summary materials of the North China Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company last year, it can be seen that among the 104 batches of cotton sent to Shanghai by North China in 1949, 95 batches were upgraded after re-inspection, while only three batches were downgraded.

　　Fourth, the price difference between seed cotton and lint cotton is unreasonable: This year's cotton harvest is better, and the ginning percentage in many areas has reached about 35%. Directly purchasing seed cotton can reduce the drawbacks of water addition and adulteration. However, farmers sometimes suffer losses when selling seed cotton. Taking Shijiazhuang as an example, on September 27, the price of lint cotton per jin was 7,500 yuan, while the price of seed cotton per jin was only 2,600 yuan. According to the ginning percentage of 35%, the reasonable price of seed cotton per jin should be 2,795 yuan, a difference of 195 yuan. According to the same method of calculation, the price of seed cotton per jin in Tangshan on September 17 also differed by 256 yuan.

　　(IV)
　　The implementation of the policy of guaranteeing reasonable cotton prices is not only related to the realization of the cotton production increase plan for next year, but also affects the production of cotton in the next few years. It is not enough to rely on pure political appeals to expand the cotton planting area and increase the yield per unit area. What is more important is the solid guarantee of reasonable economic interests for farmers, which requires the staff at all levels of our trade departments, textile industry departments, and agricultural departments to jointly recognize the important significance of this issue, and at the same time, conduct frequent, in-depth, and specific analysis and research on objective reality in order to reach a consistent understanding, consistent pace, and correct implementation of the established policy of guaranteeing reasonable cotton prices by our people's country, and to correct the deviations that occur at any time and prevent the occurrence and development of deviations. The instructions issued by the Ministry of Trade and the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government on October 14 to truly guarantee reasonable cotton prices and correct the deviations in implementation are a concrete manifestation of the above-mentioned common understanding. We must earnestly study and resolutely implement them.
　　Secondly, under the current situation that agricultural production accounts for the largest proportion of the national economy in our country, the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products cannot be eliminated for a while. Therefore, cotton prices cannot be comprehensively increased due to the increase in yarn prices; at the same time, we must also achieve the government's specified ratio standard and the consistency of listed prices and market prices in the market, county towns, and market towns where farmers directly sell cotton. This requires fully estimating the reality of the improvement of farmers' purchasing power, especially in concentrated cotton-producing areas, and timely supplying more food, coal, agricultural tools, general merchandise, etc., and striving to reduce the scissors difference to a possible reasonable level. Adjusting the price difference between large and medium-sized cities and county towns and market towns should not only guarantee the actual income of farmers, but also make merchants profitable. Strengthening market leadership and management and purchase organization work should guide to planned purchases as much as possible, neither suppressing grades and prices nor raising market prices due to competition for purchases. The key to the realization of these tasks is, first of all, the concerted efforts and consistent implementation of the cotton, yarn, and cloth companies and other related professional companies at all levels. Secondly, the strengthening of cooperative work is also extremely important. Only with the widespread development and improvement of cooperative work can we better supply farmers with various necessities and reduce the price difference between urban and rural areas. In addition, the agricultural sector must also focus on the long-term and strengthen the investigation and research of rural economy in cotton-producing areas, and plan the degree to which the cotton planting area in the main cotton-producing areas may be concentrated based on the current development of state-owned trade, cooperative strength, transportation conditions, etc., so as to avoid excessive concentration in the case that various economic conditions are not yet available, making cotton prices unable to be guaranteed.
　　Again, as pointed out in the joint instructions of the Ministry of Trade and the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government on implementing the cotton-grain ratio and determining the price of seed cotton, the price of seed cotton should be appropriately increased, because the purchase of seed cotton can avoid water adulteration and adulteration. In addition, this year's cotton harvest is abundant and the ginning percentage is high, generally reaching about 34%-35% in many cotton areas. Therefore, the concept that the price of seed cotton is equivalent to one-third of the price of lint cotton is inappropriate. The principle for determining the price of seed cotton should take into account the general level of the ginning percentage, so as not to disadvantage cotton with a high ginning percentage, and add 40% of the cotton seed price is appropriate, because the processing fee generally only needs 60% of the seed.
　　Last year, frost-yellow flowers were not accepted during the flower collection, so that 20% of the harvest in many cotton areas had no sales channels. Most farmers painfully sold them to merchants at low prices. Later, due to the shortage of raw cotton, frost-yellow flowers were purchased again. As a result, farmers sold at reasonable prices in vain, suffered a great loss on frost flowers, and merchants earned excessive and unreasonable profits, and the quantity of frost flowers used in the yarn mills varied before and after, so that the quality of yarn and cloth was generally reduced. This year, we must pay attention to the planned purchase and allocation of frost flowers as soon as possible to protect the interests of farmers and ensure the quality of yarn and cloth.

　　贯彻保护棉花生产的价格政策
    （一）
    棉作上的经济保护政策，对于棉花生产的恢复和发展，具有极重大的意义。我国是世界上最宜于棉花生长的大国之一。棉花栽培虽然已有悠久的历史，然而在帝国主义官僚资本封建地主的重重压迫和惨酷无情的剥削下，始终得不到发展。原棉纱布市场为帝国主义所操纵，农民把栽培棉花看作是一种“赌博”；市场上的价格好一点，一年劳动还可能得到些报酬；价格不好，就会因植棉挨饿，在产棉集中地区，不断地闹丰收灾荒。因之，农民对植棉不发生兴趣，只有有贮藏能力，可以待价而沽的地主富农才敢种棉花。所以解放前占棉花栽培面积数量较大的是地主、富农，中、贫农因为棉价没有保证，他们是不敢在自己拿高租重息租来的一小片土地上植棉的。
    美、英、日等帝国主义利用中国廉价的劳动力，在中国开办纱厂，倾销纱布，尤其是美帝国主义更大量倾销原棉，仅一九四六年随着美援而涌入我国市场的外棉达六百八十九万担，占我国当年棉花总产量七百四十三万担的百分之九十二点七。更进而与官僚资本相勾结，在我国主要棉产区实施限价收购等反动措施，垄断棉花市场，严重的绞杀了我国的棉花生产。
     （二）
    全国解放后，棉花生产的恢复与发展是飞跃前进的。尤其是一九五○年，由一九四九年全国植棉总面积三千九百三十万亩迅速扩展到五千六百七十五万亩，计扩大棉田面积百分之四十二：皮棉产量由一九四九年九百零七万担增加到一千四百二十万担，计增加百分之五十六以上；与抗日战争前一九三三年至一九三七年五年的平均产量一千二百余万担相较，亦已超过二百万担以上。单位面积的产量亦有普遍的提高：河北之斯字二Ｂ棉区，石家庄市郊每亩可收到二三○斤，晋县、临清、夏津、邱县等地每亩可收一三○斤，个别植棉模范农民，如河北省晋县北彭家庄村许老墨每亩产量竟可高达六○○斤籽棉。这些都是中国历史上空前的现象，给新中国的棉花生产指出一个极其光明的前途。
    如此飞跃的令人兴奋的发展，当然首先是由于老区的土地改革，新区的减租退租，广大农民获得了生产及生活资料、土地、耕牛、农具等，挣脱了几千年来的封建锁链的束缚，以高度的热情，在国家的种种帮助下，进行了忘我劳动的结果，同时也应该特别指出的是我们的人民政府给予人民的正确价格政策保证的结果。一九四九年在已解放了的华北地区，华北人民政府公布了一斤皮棉保证换得八斤小米的比价，在主要大城市未获得解放，人民解放军还在进行大规模的作战，交通未完全恢复，物价未趋稳定，尤其是粮价不断上涨的极端困难的情况下，我们的国营贸易公司进行了十分艰苦的工作，贯彻执行了政府给予农民的保证，供给了棉区农民以大量的食粮、燃料、与百货。一九五○年中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会公布了全国各个产棉区棉花与主要食粮的比价，这就使千百万植棉的农民从他们的实际经验基础上，与对人民政府的无限信任上，扩大了植棉面积，并且向棉田里施了更多的肥料，支付了更多的劳动力，提高了单位面积的产量。
    上述这一重大经验也是为我们伟大的邻邦苏联所证实了的。当沙皇政府被推翻，苏维埃政府刚一成立，就重视了“要增大保证俄国纺织业的棉花”。（列宁语）一九二○年十一月二日，由列宁签署的命令中曾说：“按照合同条件，以棉花交换，供给人民粮食和日用品。”为了调剂棉区的食粮，一九二六年棉业总署组织了大规模的“亚细亚谷物股份公司”，在这一时期并且实施了保证棉花合理价格，免税奖励，订立预购契约等一连串的政策，在恢复棉田面积上发生了极其良好的作用。一九三四年十二月二十三日劳动国防委员会又通过了提高采购棉花平均价格至四倍的决定，一九三五年春耕前把这个新价格向集体农庄公布，并依照斯大林同志的指示，规定了棉花产量的超额奖励制，在提高单位面积的产量上发生了良好的影响，促使许多集体农庄每公顷的棉花达到平均三十公担的产量。
     （三）
    今年对保证棉花合理价格政策的执行上，目前一般的情况是良好的，基本上保证了棉农的利益。国营花纱布公司、粮食公司、百货公司等都一致配合，努力认真执行中央人民政府的既定政策。但同时也还存在着下述几个必须认真改善的问题：
    第一、是各产棉集中区的农民普遍反映棉粮比价有时低于政府公布的价格。根据上海联合过磅处的总结材料，十月份产棉集中区几个大中城市棉粮比价的情况如下表：
    城市名  棉价（元）  粮价（元） 比价（倍）  保定  七五三三
    九四六  七·九六  石家庄  七三○○  九一三  八·○○  太原
    七一○○  八四○  八·四五  新乡  七○八○  八六一  八·二
    二  唐山  七九○○  一○九六  七·二一  杭州  七六六六  一
    六二七  四·七一  南京  八○八三  一○○三  八·○五  济南
    七七○○  九五○ 八·一一  汉口  七二二三  八七一  八·二
    九  长沙  七五○○  八一二  九·二四  郑州  七二四一  九六
    八  七·四八  西安  六九六六  八四三  八·二六
    附注：（１）棉价均为八分之七英寸中级标准皮棉价格。（２）粮食汉口为二机米，济南、郑州、西安为小麦，其余南方均为大米，北方均为小米。（３）单位为市斤元。（４）比价是一斤皮棉价折合若干斤粮食。
    从上表数字来看，棉粮比价虽然多数地区符合了公布的价格标准，仅有个别地区不能达到，但我们还不能就此得出结论说：已做到了合理的保证，因为上表是大中城市的价格，而农民直接出卖棉花的市场大多数是在县城和集镇甚至是农村，因之这个价格于实际上还包括了一定数量的运费和成千上万小商贩的利润的，县城集镇的粮食价格，虽然也比较上表所列城市为低，但二者差额并不是完全一致的。大体上产棉集中地区粮价总是高一点，有时甚至高于其附近城市的价格，这从九月下旬唐山周围的县城和集镇的棉花价格和唐山市场上棉花价格的差价上可以看出来。根据九月二十六日调查唐山周围小集、乐亭、玉田、遵化、丰润、滦南、昌黎、抚宁、卢龙、迁安等地棉价与唐山相差百分之五——七·八。
    第二、九月份之前，许多市场上曾有一段时间，出现过一斤皮棉合到二十斤小米的棉价偏高现象，例如八月下旬太原斤棉换麦十二斤，临汾曾涨到斤棉斗麦，宁武、上党、沁县一带斤棉换米二十二到二十八斤。此种现象的形成，主要系新棉尚未大量上市，旧棉即将售罄的季节性的暂时现象，故从九月下旬，尤其是十月份一直到现在新棉大量上市后，棉价便逐渐降到标准比价。甚至低于标准比价。另一种情况是不少地区存在着市价高于国营花纱布公司的牌价，十月份几个主要原棉市场牌价、市价的差额的比较统计如下表：
    地名  牌价（元）  市价（元）  市价对牌价  保定  七、五三三
    七、五三三  石家庄  七、三○○  七、三○○  太原 七、一○○
    七、三六六  一○三·七  新乡  七、○八○  七、五五○  一○
    六·六  杭州  七、四一○  七、六八三  一○三·七  济南 七、
    七○○  八、○九一  一○五·一  郑州  七、二四一  七、五一
    七  一○三·八  西安  六、九六六  七、○六六  一○一·四
    此种情况的形成，主要是由于近几个月来棉纱价格略有上升，以天津为例，十月份每件纱较九月份上升百分之五·四九，石家庄则上升百分之七·九，唐山上升百分之八·六五。
    由于纺织利润增大，尤其是内地城市，私营工商业怕原料困难，即以较牌价稍高的价格收购。另一个情况是今年棉花收成好，籽棉衣分普遍的高，在收购籽棉上价格稍高一点实际上并不吃亏，这也是牌价低于市价的原因。
    第三、广大棉农的另一个反映是在收购中分级有时不很恰当，以致农民的优棉得不到优价，从而影响到合理比价的贯彻执行。这是因为私营商贩为图谋高额利润，尽量欺骗人民压低等级，而国营花纱布公司则主要是由于分级检验人员经验不足，同时多少存在着一些怕亏本的思想，因而采取了宁低勿高的做法，这样就损害了农民的利益。从去年华北花纱布公司的总结材料中可以看出一九四九年华北送到上海的一○四批棉花中，复验结果增级的有九十五批，降级的则只有三批。
    第四、籽棉皮棉的差价不合理：今年棉花收成较好，许多地区衣分都达到百分之三十五左右，且直接收购籽棉可减少施水掺杂之弊。但是农民出售籽棉，有时反而吃亏，以石家庄为例，九月二十七日每斤皮棉价为七、五○○元，每斤籽棉则仅二六○○元，按照百分之三五的衣分计算，每斤籽棉的合理价格应为二七九五元，相差一九五元。依照同样方法计算，九月十七日唐山每斤籽棉的价格也相差二五六元。
    （四）
    保证棉花合理价格政策的贯彻执行，不仅关系着明年棉花增产计划的实现，同时也影响到今后几年棉花的生产。扩大棉田面积，增加单位面积的产量，依靠单纯的政治号召是不够的。更重要的是对农民合理的经济利益的坚实的保证，这就需要我们贸易部门，纺织工业部门，农业部门的各级工作人员共同认识这一问题的重要意义，同时须对客观实际情况作经常的深入具体的分析研究，才能认识一致，步调一致，正确的贯彻执行我们人民国家保证合理棉价的既定政策，随时纠正发生的偏向，和防止偏向的产生与发展。十月十四日中央人民政府贸易部和农业部发出确实保证合理的棉价，纠正执行中产生的偏向的指示，就是上述共同认识的具体体现，我们必须认真的研究与坚决的贯彻执行。
    其次，在目前我国农业生产占着国民经济最大比重的情况下，工农业品的剪刀差额一时还不可能消灭，因此，不能因纱价上升而全面的提高棉价；同时我们也必须做到在农民直接出售棉花的市场、县城、集镇，达到政府规定的比价标准，和牌价市价的一致，这就需要充分估计到农民购买力提高的现实，尤其是产棉集中地区，需要及时供给更多的食粮、煤炭、农具、百货等，并争取剪刀差额缩小到可能的合理程度。调整大中城市与县城集镇的价格差额，既要保证农民的实际所得，也要使商贩有利可图，加强市场的领导与管理及收购组织工作，尽可能导向有计划的收购，既不压级压价也不因争购而抬高市价。这些工作实现的关键，首先，是各级花纱布公司以及其他有关专业公司的结合一致，努力贯彻。其次合作社工作的加强也极重要，只有合作社工作广泛的发展与健全，才能更好的供给农民种种必须品，与缩小城乡价格的差额。此外农业部门还须从长期着眼，加强产棉区农村经济的调查研究，根据目前国营贸易、合作社力量的发展情况，交通运输状况等条件，规划出主要棉区植棉面积可能集中的程度，以免在各种经济条件还不具备的情况下，过分集中使棉价无力保证。
    再次，正如中央贸易部与农业部关于贯彻棉粮比价确定籽棉价格的联合指示所指出的应当适当提高籽棉价格，因为收购籽棉可避免掺水掺杂，加之今年棉花收成丰盛，衣分较高，许多棉区一般可达百分之三十四——三十五左右，因之籽棉相当于皮棉价格的三分之一的概念是不妥当的，规定籽棉价格的原则应该是照顾到一般衣分的高低，不使衣分高的棉花吃亏，并加百分之四十的棉籽价为合适，因为加工费一般只需种籽的百分之六十。
    去年收花中不收霜黄花，以致占许多棉区百分之二十的收成没有销路，多数农民忍痛低价卖给商贩，后来因原棉不足又收购了霜黄花，结果是农民白花卖到了合理的价格，霜花上吃了大亏，商贩赚得了过高的不合理的利润，而且纱厂配用霜花数量前后不同，以致普遍反映纱布质量降低。今年必须及早注意有计划的收购霜花，配用霜花，以保护农民利益，保证纱布质量。
