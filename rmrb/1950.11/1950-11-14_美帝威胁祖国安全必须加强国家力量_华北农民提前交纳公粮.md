Xinhua News Agency, 12th. North China farmers are beginning a surge of early public grain deliveries. He Lianrong (female), a farmer from Xiazhuang Village, Lingshou County, Hebei Province, said: "In the past, we paid public grain to support the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. Today, our country's security is being severely threatened by U.S. imperialism. We must actively pay public grain and strengthen national strength in order to protect our good life."

    This autumn's public grain collection in Chahar Province was originally scheduled to begin this month and be completed within one month. However, in many areas, it has already started early or has been completed early at the request of farmers. For example, in ChengGuan District, Yanggao County, the province began collecting on October 25th, and by the 26th, all the public grain due from the district had been put into storage. In Donghongya Village, Zuoyun County, and other villages, collection began on November 1st, and farmers paid in full on the same day. Farmers in Datong County are delivering public grain quickly and well. Farmers in Zhijiabao Village in that county said: "This is patriotic grain." Many farmers fanned the grain with winnowing fans and tossed it very clean with winnowing baskets, braving the cold wind outside the Great Wall to send it to warehouses fifty miles away overnight. Farmers in Ding County, Anguo, Jianping, Wuqing, Wangdu, and other places in Hebei Province had prepared grain and cotton after the autumn harvest, waiting to pay. Therefore, as soon as the collection was announced, farmers enthusiastically sent grain to the warehouses. Qian GuanYing and Zhao Chang villages in Daxing County in the province were flooded this summer, and the government had already exempted them from this season's public grain. However, after hearing that the flames of U.S. imperialist aggression had reached our borders, the farmers of the two villages voluntarily contributed 1,500 catties of grain to the country. Farmers in Shanxi and Pingyuan provinces have also begun to send grain. Many farmers in Wudong and Liangcheng, Suiyuan, eagerly drove animal-drawn carts to the grain collection points to request early payment.

    This year's autumn harvest is generally abundant in North China, and the autumn collection burden is slightly lighter than last year. Moreover, the autumn collection work has a foundation from the past, the yield per mu is relatively accurate, and the grain stations, warehouses, and the conversion of grain and cotton have all been well prepared in advance. These are the reasons why this year's autumn collection work in North China can be carried out quickly and smoothly. Because Suiyuan Province is a new area, the province began publicizing the autumn collection policy, checking and reporting land, and assessing production in August this year. In September, special districts and counties established autumn collection work committees and sent more than 1,300 cadres to the countryside, making considerable preparations. Now that the province has started collection, it is generally holding farmer representative meetings to publicize the policy of reasonable burden. Therefore, it is estimated that the grain collection work in the province can also be completed smoothly.

　　美帝威胁祖国安全必须加强国家力量
    华北农民提前交纳公粮
    【新华社十二日讯】华北各省农民正掀起早交公粮的热潮。河北灵寿县下庄村农民何连荣（女）说：咱们过去缴公粮支援了抗日战争的胜利，今天我们国家的安全正受到美帝国主义的严重威胁，必须积极缴纳公粮，加强国家力量，才能保住咱们的好日子。
    察哈尔省今年秋季公粮原定本月开征，在一个月内完成。但许多地区在农民要求下已提前开征或已提前完成。如该省阳高县城关区十月二十五日开征，二十六日全区应缴公粮就已全部入仓。左云县东红崖村等村十一月一日开征，农民当天就缴齐了。大同县农民交纳公粮都是又快又好。该县智家堡村农民说：这是交爱国粮。许多农民把粮食用扇车扇过又用簸箕扬得很干净，连夜冒着塞外的风寒送往五十里以外的仓库。河北省定县、安国、建屏、武清、望都等地的农民，都是在秋收后就把粮食棉花预备好了，等着交纳，因此，一宣布开征农民即踊跃送粮食入仓。该省大兴县前管营和赵场两村今年夏天被水淹了，政府本已豁免了本季的公粮。但两村农民在听到美帝国主义的侵略火焰已经烧到我们国境之后，即自愿给国家献纳了一千五百斤粮食。山西、平原等省农民现在也已开始送粮，绥远武东、凉城许多农民因迫不及待，赶着牲口大车送了粮食到征粮地点要求预缴。
    华北各地今年普遍丰收，秋征负担又比去年略有减轻，而且秋征工作过去有基础，地亩产量比较确实，粮站仓库、粮食棉花的折算等事前都有很好准备，这些都是华北今年秋征工作得以迅速和顺利进行的原因。绥远省因为是新区，该省在今年八月就已开始宣传秋征政策，查报土地和评定产量；九月间各专区和县就成立了秋征工作委员会，派了一千三百多干部下乡，准备得相当充分。现在该省开征后，正在普遍召开农民代表会议，宣传合理负担的政策。因此，该省征粮工作估计亦可顺利完成。
