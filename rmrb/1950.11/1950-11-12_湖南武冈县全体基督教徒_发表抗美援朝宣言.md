　　All Christians in Wugang County, Hunan Province
　  Issue Declaration to Resist America and Aid Korea
    [Report from this newspaper] All Christians in Wugang County, Hunan Province, issued the following declaration to resist America and aid Korea:
    Under the instigation of American imperialism's big capitalists, big arms dealers, and ambitious individuals who want to enslave all of humanity, they have openly torn up treaties they themselves established, destroyed the world peace that people around the world hoped for, and launched a large-scale military invasion of our neighbor Korea, massacring and bombing the Korean people. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung, has been working hard to build the area north of the 38th parallel for several years, leading the people onto the road of prosperity and happiness. American imperialism, in order to enslave Asia, is starting with Korea and has sent aircraft to reconnoiter, strafe, and bomb our country's airspace, with the intention of invading our territory. Just as our motherland has embarked on the road to recovery and construction, American imperialism, this small group of brutal wolves, is about to provoke us again. We must unite as one, raise the giant fist of the people, and defend peace. We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement on the current situation of the US imperialist invasion of Korea. We believe that the barbaric, reactionary, peace-destroying, and unjust American imperialist beasts will be crushed by the awakened people of the world and the brave Korean fighters. Fellow compatriots who love the motherland, let us unite even more closely, and under the banner of Chairman Mao, actively support the fraternal Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We are on full alert, and we will not allow the mouths of the wild boars to cross even one step into our country's sacred borders!
                                      All Chinese Christians in Wugang County, Hunan Province

　　湖南武冈县全体基督教徒
　  发表抗美援朝宣言
    【本报讯】湖南武冈县全体基督教徒，发表抗美援朝的宣言如下：
    美帝国主义在大资本家、大军火贩子及想要奴役全世界人类的野心家们的策动下，公然撕毁他们自己所定的条约，破坏举世人民所期望的世界和平，向我们的邻邦朝鲜大举进军，残杀轰炸朝鲜人民。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，在金日成将军领导之下，在朝鲜“三八”线以北地区，数年来艰苦建设，已领导人民走上康乐幸福的道路。美帝国主义为了要奴役亚洲，先从朝鲜下手，并且派遣飞机在我国领空上侦察，扫射轰炸，有窥窃我国领土之企图。当我们的祖国刚刚步上恢复建设之途，美帝国主义，这小群残暴的狼，他就又要来挑衅。我们必须团结一心，举起人民的巨拳，来保卫和平。我们坚决拥护周外长对美帝侵朝的时局声明。相信野蛮的、反动的、破坏和平、毫无正义的美帝国主义这帮野兽，必将为已经觉醒了的全世界人民和朝鲜英勇的战士们打得粉碎。热爱祖国的同胞们，让我们团结得更紧，在毛主席旗帜下，积极支援兄弟之邦朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。我们严阵以待，不准野猪的嘴吧，越过一步到我国神圣的边疆！
