　　Learn from the Example of the Soviet Union and Strive to Defend World Peace and Oppose the Aggressive War of US Imperialism
　　Chen Qiyou
　　The Soviet Union's October Revolution overthrew the rule of the old Russian imperialism and became a brand new socialist Soviet republic. A new era in human history was thus marked, that is, the appearance of a socialist country on one-sixth of the world's land, and the world revolution entered a new stage.
　　The October Revolution wrote a brilliant and victorious page in human history. Not only were the two hundred million people of the Soviet Union liberated because of this, but it also brought hope for a better and happier life to all mankind. It pointed out the path of struggle for the world's proletariat and oppressed nations, and it gave all mankind great joy and encouragement.
　　After the Soviet Union achieved victory in the October Revolution, it greatly expanded production and construction. After the completion of the three five-year plans, it has been transformed from an agricultural country into an industrial country. Now it continues to actively carry out large-scale economic construction, moving towards the goal of communist construction. Its national strength is invincible in the world. After the October Revolution, it first defeated the siege of the fourteen-nation foreign intervention army, and in the Second World War, it defeated the powerful invading armies of German and Japanese fascism, making the socialist Soviet Union even stronger in battle.
　　At the same time, its powerful strength is built on the foundation of world peace and democracy. It is the most loyal friend and brother of the world's oppressed nations and people, especially its assistance to the Chinese people is the most cordial. The Chinese revolution was inspired by the Soviet Union and received selfless assistance, which enabled it to achieve the great victory of people's liberation. Because of the powerful national defense forces of the Soviet people, and their high degree of selfless patriotism and strong will to defend peace, it constitutes a strong fortress for defending world peace and preventing aggressive wars.
　　Today, US imperialism is frantically expanding its aggressive war, and world peace is seriously threatened. The conspiracy of the US military to invade Korea is following in the footsteps of Japanese fascism, attempting to expand its invasion of our Northeast, destroy our country, and enslave the entire Asian people. It is invading our Taiwan, sending naval and air forces to invade our territorial waters and airspace, and slaughtering our people. On the one hand, it is colluding with the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to send special agents and henchmen, conspiring to sabotage our peaceful construction. The people of the whole country have thoroughly recognized the brutal and hideous face of US imperialism. It is not only the deadly enemy of the Chinese people, but also the common enemy of the Asian people and the people of the world. We must strengthen the unity and cooperation with the Soviet Union, the most loyal friend of the Chinese people and the fortress of world peace. This cooperation is the great unity of 675 million people in the world, and its strength is invincible in the world. On the basis of this great unity, we must step up our efforts to assist the Korean people, defeat the US aggressor troops, and completely smash the US imperialist conspiracy to expand its aggressive war.
　　When we commemorate the Soviet Union's October Revolution, we must strengthen and enhance the ideology of internationalism and patriotism, learn from the Soviet Union's example of building a strong national defense, learn from the Soviet Union's high degree of selfless patriotism and strong will to defend peace and its fighting spirit, closely rally around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and strive to build a new democratic China, and strive to defend world peace and oppose the aggressive war of US imperialism.
　　Long live the great unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union!

　　学习苏联的榜样，为保卫世界和平反对美帝国主义的侵略战争而奋斗
    陈其尤
    苏联的十月革命，推翻了旧俄帝国主义的统治，成为一个崭新的社会主义苏维埃共和国，人类历史上从此划了一个新的时代，即是社会主义国家在世界六分之一的土地上出现，世界革命走入了一个新的阶段。
    十月革命写上了人类历史光辉胜利的一页，苏联的两亿广大人民，不仅因此得到解放，而且带给全人类以美好幸福生活的希望，她指引全世界无产阶级和被压迫民族斗争的道路，她给予全人类莫大的欢欣和鼓舞。
    苏联在十月革命取得胜利之后，大大的展开生产建设，经过了三次五年计划的完成，已由农业国转变为工业国，现在还继续不断地积极地展开大规模的经济建设，向着共产主义建设的目标迈进，她的国力的强大是世界无敌的。她在十月革命后，第一次击败了十四国外国干涉军的围攻，在第二次大战中，又击败了德国和日本法西斯强大的侵略军，使社会主义的苏联在战斗中更加强大。
    同时她的强大的力量是建筑在世界和平民主基础上的。她是全世界被压迫民族和人民的最忠诚的朋友和兄弟，尤其是对中国人民的援助，是最为亲切的，中国的革命是受着苏联的鼓舞和大公无私的援助，才能够取得伟大的人民解放胜利。由于苏联人民强大的国防的力量，和他们高度的忘我的爱国主义及保卫和平的坚强意志相结合，就构成了保卫世界和平制止侵略战争的坚强堡垒。
    今天美帝国主义正在疯狂地扩大侵略战争，世界和平受着严重的威胁，侵略朝鲜美军的阴谋正步着日本法西斯的后尘，企图扩大侵略我们的东北，灭亡我们的国家，奴役整个亚洲人民，它侵略我们的台湾，派遣海空军侵入我国的领海、领空，残杀我国人民，一方面勾结蒋匪残余派遣特务爪牙，阴谋破坏我国的和平建设，全国人民都彻底认识了美帝的凶残的狰狞面目，她不仅是中国人民的死敌，而且是亚洲人民和全世界人民的公敌。我们要加强和中国人民最忠诚的朋友，世界和平堡垒苏联的团结合作，这一合作，是世界上六万万七千五百万人民的大团结，其力量是无敌于天下的。在这大团结的基础上，我们要加紧大力的援助朝鲜人民，击败美帝的侵略军，彻底粉碎美帝扩大侵略战争的阴谋。
    我们纪念苏联十月革命，就要加强提高国际主义爱国主义的思想，学习苏联建设强大的国防的榜样，学习苏联高度的忘我的爱国主义和保卫和平的坚强意志及其战斗精神，紧紧的围绕在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，为建设新民主主义的新中国而奋斗，为保卫世界和平反对美帝国主义的侵略战争而奋斗。
    中苏两国人民大团结万岁！
