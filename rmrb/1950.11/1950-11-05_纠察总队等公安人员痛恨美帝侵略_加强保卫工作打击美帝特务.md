　　Public security personnel from the Disciplinary Corps of the Ministry of Public Security, the Central Corps of the People's Public Security Forces, the public security departments of Changchun City, and the Baoding Public Security Section, as well as Zhang Qinglin, a soldier from the Guard Company of the Railway Ministry's Public Security Bureau, expressed extreme anger at the U.S. imperialists' expansion of aggression and resolved to resolutely suppress special agents and counter-revolutionaries, do a good job in security work, and resist U.S. aggression to aid Korea and defend the homeland.

　　Disciplinary Corps Enthusiastically Studies and Discusses Current Events
　　Determined to Eliminate Bandits and Spies to Stabilize Social Order

　　Starting from October 23rd, the Disciplinary Corps conducted widespread current affairs studies and discussions. Everyone more clearly recognized the U.S. imperialists' aggressive conspiracies and resolutely stated: we must heighten our vigilance and make full preparations; and actively work hard to eliminate bandits and spies and stabilize social order. Liu Xingrui, an advanced duty model from the fourth squad of the second detachment, said with confidence: "The Chinese people have the strength to sanction U.S. imperialist aggression. Don't think the U.S. imperialists seem fierce now; the path of the Japanese devils is waiting for them!" Wang Shoushan, a disciplinary officer and Communist Party member from the fourth squad, received a letter from home saying that his wife and children were ill, and the team allowed him to go home, but seeing the current tense situation, he expressed to his superiors that he would concentrate on his work and not go home. He said: "Going home is my personal matter, but defending the motherland is a task given to us by the people of the whole country." Referring to the current sabotage activities of special agents, he said: "We must never be careless. Special agents and counter-revolutionaries are carrying out sabotage activities, so we must be especially cautious in our duties and careful everywhere."

　　A Unit of the Central Public Security Corps
　　Intensive Military Training to Strengthen Civilian Work

　　In order to prepare to resist U.S. imperialist aggression at any time, a unit of the Central Corps of the People's Public Security Forces enthusiastically launched a military training campaign. Clerks and instructors also carried large guns and bayonets to participate, and seized rest time to train in small groups. In order to resolutely suppress special agents, bandits, and all counter-revolutionaries, the regiment also strengthened civilian work. The civilian work groups of each unit have been reorganized, and working methods have been changed to closely cooperate with local governments and police stations to strengthen contact with the masses, expose U.S. imperialist aggression conspiracies, smash bandits and spies' rumors, and raise the masses' awareness and vigilance. Sun Yewu of the fourth company wanted to write a letter of denunciation and a letter of determination when U.S. planes invaded our airspace in September. The resolution of all comrades in the communication squad of the police communication company of a certain regiment stated: "We must support the Korean people with practical actions, firmly stand our ground, resolutely suppress the sabotage and rumors of any bad elements; resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism, defend the motherland, and defend peace!" Wang Wensheng, a labor model from the second company, said angrily at the regiment's hero model anti-U.S. rally: "Today, U.S. imperialism is frantically invading Korea, seriously threatening the security of the motherland. It is trying to invade China and expand the war. We must resolutely smash this conspiracy." Then he said: "We were oppressed and ruled by the Japanese devils in the Northeast for fourteen years, living a life like slaves and cattle. The Communist Party and Chairman Mao led us to turn over, liberate my family, distribute land, have food and clothing, and build an industrialized Northeast homeland. Now U.S. imperialism wants to destroy it. This is absolutely not allowed by the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army! We must be vigilant and responsible to resolutely eliminate special agent bandits, victoriously complete the glorious task of security work, help the Korean people, and support the fraternal troops to liberate Taiwan."

　　Changchun Public Security Staff Opposes Aggression
　　Expresses Determination to Demand Payment for the Blood Debt Owed by U.S. Imperialism

　　All the staff of the Dongertiao Police Station of the Second Public Security Bureau of Changchun City protested against the atrocities of U.S. planes repeatedly illegally invading our airspace, bombing and injuring our compatriots, and damaging our property, saying: This fact more clearly exposes the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to expand aggression. We can never allow this kind of aggression. We are the youth of the new China and have the responsibility to defend the motherland. We will never forget that our compatriots have been killed and injured, and we must demand payment for this blood debt. All comrades in our public security police station unanimously stated: we must turn anger into the power of work, smash any U.S. imperialist provocation, stand on the security personnel's work post, concentrate on work, study hard, oppose any paralysis, and prevent enemy and special agent conspiracies and sabotage. Fu Chengzhang of the secretariat, Han Gangqiang of the investigation section, and Gao Xifu of the Fourth Public Security Bureau all believed that the series of aggressive atrocities of U.S. imperialism nakedly exposed the U.S. imperialists' ambition to invade our country by force and attempt to dominate the world. Expressed determination to demand payment for the blood debt owed by U.S. imperialism and actively support the Korean people. Han Gangqiang said: I am a passionate youth under the leadership and education of the Communist Party. I love the motherland and the people. I can no longer tolerate the aggressive acts of U.S. imperialism. I vow to contribute everything to fight to the end to defend every inch of the motherland! I am determined to strengthen my study, improve my political and theoretical level, study my profession, do a good job in security work, and fight resolutely and ruthlessly against the hidden enemies, to answer the American aggressors with practical actions.

　　Li Demao, Li Yunshan, Zhang Yuting, Li Junzhen, Du Yunge, Wang Wenxi, etc. of the Traffic Police Team of the city's Public Security Bureau protested against the crime of U.S. planes' repeated provocations, saying: U.S. imperialism helped the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang massacre the Chinese people on the mainland of China and was painfully beaten by the Chinese people and rolled out of China in embarrassment. But it still does not know shame and is still an enemy of the Chinese people and the peace-loving people all over the world, provoking wars everywhere. First, it instigated the Syngman Rhee puppet government to launch an attack on North Korea. At the same time, it openly armed and invaded our Taiwan and stole the United Nations flag to expand the Korean War, wantonly slaughtering, raping, looting, and bombing peaceful residents. This heinous crime has aroused the anger of the vast peace-loving people all over the world. At the same time, it has launched crazy and adventurous provocations against the Chinese people, repeatedly invading our airspace and strafing our peaceful residents, causing serious damage. How can the Chinese people ignore this blatant aggression! The U.S. imperialists have forgotten that they were driven out of the Chinese mainland by the powerful Chinese people, and they will repeat the footsteps of the German and Japanese fascist bandits. You must know that our Chinese people have stood up! We are united with all peace-loving people in the world, and whoever wants to invade us, we must and will be able to eliminate them. Zhao Wenxue and other thirty people from the third detachment of the Traffic Police Team of the city's Public Security Bureau stated in a joint letter of protest against the U.S. imperialism: All comrades of the Traffic Third Detachment were enraged by the shameless bombing of our Andong and the shelling of our merchant ships and the illegal questioning of our merchant ships. We further recognized the aggressive face of U.S. imperialism from these events. Peace-loving people all over the world must unite and arm themselves to prevent U.S. imperialism from destroying peace. We cannot be intimidated by the outwardly strong but inwardly weak paper tiger. It will definitely be eliminated. We are willing to oppose U.S. imperialist aggressive acts with practical actions, support the Korean people's patriotic war with all our strength, study hard, be familiar with our profession, wholeheartedly do a good job in the transportation industry, and protect the people's production and property from any loss.

　　Baoding Railway Public Security Section Personnel
　　Alert to U.S. Imperialist Special Agent Sabotage

　　The telegram of all comrades of the Baoding Railway Public Security Section "Support Foreign Minister Zhou's Protest and Smash the U.S. Imperialist Aggressive Conspiracy with Practical Actions" stated: We are the people's guards under the leadership of Chairman Mao and are responsible for maintaining railway safety. We must be seriously vigilant against the U.S. imperialists' robbery-like aggression and provocations and the sabotage and disruption of counter-revolutionary bandits and special agents under their drive, and resolutely crack down on and suppress them! We resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism's aggression against Korea and Taiwan. We are determined to demand payment for the blood debt of U.S. imperialism's massacre of our Northeast compatriots!

　　In addition, Zhang Qinglin, a soldier from the Guard Company of the Railway Ministry's Public Security Bureau, said: If U.S. imperialism wants to expand its war of aggression and oppress the Chinese people again, it is like "dreaming of marrying a wife" - a fantasy that will never be realized. The forces of democracy are constantly growing, and the only future for U.S. imperialism is the path of Hitler and Japanese imperialists. U.S. imperialist planes are constantly invading our Northeast airspace, which makes me very angry! I firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's telegram to the United Nations. I am a person with a gun, and defending the motherland is my supreme responsibility. I will always be loyal to the revolutionary cause and fight to the death for the revolutionary cause. If U.S. imperialism invades China, I will stand at the forefront and fight it to the death. I will not hesitate to shed the last drop of blood for the revolutionary cause.

    纠察总队热烈学习讨论时事
    决心肃清匪特安定社会秩序
    纠察总队从十月二十三日起，普遍进行了时事学习和讨论。大家更清楚地认识了美帝的侵略阴谋，都坚决表示：必须提高警惕，进行充分准备；并积极努力工作，肃清匪特，安定社会秩序。二大队四中队甲等执勤模范刘兴瑞满怀信心地说：“中国人民有力量，制裁美帝侵略。你别看美帝现在好像挺凶，日本鬼子的道路在等着它！”四中队纠察员、共产党员王寿山同志，他家中来信说老婆、孩子都病了，队里也允许他回家了，但是他看目前时局这样紧张，就向上级表示：安心工作，不再回家了。他说：“回家那是我个人的小事，保卫祖国是全国人民给我们的任务。”联系到目前特务破坏活动，他说：“咱们绝不可麻痹。特务反革命分子进行破坏活动，咱们执勤就要特别谨慎，处处小心。”
    中央公安纵队某部
    紧张练兵加强民运工作
    公安部队中央纵队某部为准备随时抗击美帝侵略，热烈展开练兵运动，文书、教员也背上大枪、刺刀参加，并抓紧休息时间下小操。该团为坚决镇压特务、土匪及一切反革命分子，并加强了民运工作。各单位民运组已重新调整，并改变工作方法，与地方政府、派出所密切配合，加强与群众的联系，以揭露美帝侵略阴谋，粉碎匪特谣言，提高群众觉悟和警惕。该团四连孙业武在九月间美机侵我领空时，就要写控诉信和决心书。某团警通连通讯一班全体同志的决心书中说：“我们要以实际行动来支援朝鲜人民，坚决站稳自己的立场，坚决镇压任何坏分子的破坏和造谣；坚决反对美帝国主义，保卫祖国，保卫和平！”二连劳动模范王文胜在团英模反美大会上，愤怒地发言说：“今天美帝国主义疯狂侵略朝鲜，严重的威胁着祖国的安全。它妄想侵略中国，扩大战争，我们一定要坚决粉碎它这种阴谋。”接着他又说：“我们在东北受了日本鬼子十四年压迫统治，过着奴隶牛马般的生活，共产党、毛主席领导着我们翻了身，解放了我的家。分了土地，有吃有穿，建设着工业化的东北故乡。现在美帝国主义要来破坏，这是中国人民和人民解放军所决对不能允许的！我们一定要紧张起来，更加提高警惕性与责任心，坚决消灭特务匪徒，以胜利完成保卫工作的光荣任务，帮助朝鲜人民，并支援兄弟部队解放台湾。”
    长春公安工作人员反对侵略
    表示定要讨还美帝所欠血债
    长春市人民政府第二公安分局东二条派出所全体工作人员对美机多次非法侵我领空，炸伤我国同胞，损毁我国财产的暴行，提出抗议说：这个事实更加明显地暴露出美帝国主义扩大侵略的阴谋。此种侵略行为，我们是决不能容许的。我们是新中国的青年，负有保卫祖国的责任。同胞被杀伤了，是我们永远也不能忘记的，一定要讨还这笔血债。我们公安派出所全体同志，一致表示：要把愤怒变成工作的力量，粉碎美帝任何挑衅，站在保卫人员的工作岗位上，安心工作，努力学习，反对任何麻痹思想，防止敌特阴谋破坏。第四公安分局全体青年团员及秘书股富成章，调查股韩刚强，和高锡福都认为：美帝一系列的侵略暴行，赤裸裸地暴露了美帝国主义武装侵略我国的野心和企图独霸世界的狰狞面目。表示决心讨还美帝所欠血债，积极支援朝鲜人民。韩刚强说：我是在共产党领导教育下的有热血的青年。我热爱祖国，热爱人民。对美帝的侵略行为，已再也不能容忍。我誓愿贡献出自己的一切，为保卫祖国的每一块土地奋斗到底！我今后决心加强学习，提高政治、理论水平，钻研业务，做好保卫工作，与隐蔽的敌人作坚决无情的斗争，以实际行动来回答美国侵略者。
    该市公安局交通队李德茂、李云山、张玉亭、李俊桢、杜云阁、王文玺等抗议美机屡次挑衅的罪行说：美帝国主义在中国大陆上，帮助蒋介石匪帮屠杀中国人民，曾惨遭中国人民的痛打，狼狈地滚出了中国。但它尚不知羞耻，仍与中国人民及全世界爱好和平的人民为敌，到处挑拨战争，首先唆使李承晚傀儡政府对北朝鲜发动进攻，同时公开武装侵略我国台湾，并盗用联合国旗帜，扩大侵朝战争，恣意屠杀、奸淫、掠夺、轰炸和平居民。这种万恶罪行，已激起全世界广大爱好和平人民的愤怒。同时更对中国人民发起疯狂而冒险的挑衅，屡次侵入我国领空，扫射我国和平居民，造成严重损伤。这种露骨的侵略兽行，中国人民岂能置之不理？！美帝忘了它是被强有力的中国人民从中国大陆赶出去的，它将重步德国和日本法西斯强盗的后尘。要知道，我们中国人民已经站立起来啦！我们和世界上一切爱好和平的人民团结在一起，谁要侵略我们，我们就必须也一定能消灭它们。该市公安局交通队第三分驻所赵文学等三十人联名对美帝的抗议书中表示：交通三分所全体同志为美帝无耻轰炸我国安东，炮击并非法盘查我国商船的万恶罪行，激起了一致的愤怒。我们由这些事件更进一步认清了美帝的侵略面目。爱好和平的全世界人民，要团结起来，武装起来，不准美帝破坏和平。我们不能让外强中干的纸老虎吓唬住，它是一定会被消灭的。我们愿以实际行动来反对美帝侵略行为，要以一切力量来支援朝鲜人民的爱国战争，努力学习、熟悉业务，全心全意把交通事业搞好，保护人民生产财产，不使受到一点损失。
    保定铁路公安段人员
    警惕美帝特务破坏
    保安铁路公安段全体同志“拥护周外长抗议，以实际行动粉碎美帝国主义侵略阴谋”的电文中说：我们是毛主席领导下的人民警卫员，担负着维护铁路安全的任务。对于美帝强盗性的侵略挑衅和在其驱使下的反革命匪特们的破坏捣乱，要严重警惕，并予以坚决的打击与镇压！我们坚决反对美帝侵略朝鲜，侵略台湾，我们坚决要讨还美帝屠杀我国东北同胞的这笔血债！
    此外，铁道部公安局警卫连战士张庆林表示说：美帝国主义要想扩大侵略战争，再来压迫中国人民，等于“做梦娶媳妇”——空想，绝对不会实现的。民主力量不断增长着，美帝国主义唯一的前途，就是希特勒和日本帝国主义者的道路。美帝国主义的飞机，不断来侵犯我国东北领空，我真气极了！我坚决拥护周外长给联合国的电报。我是一个拿枪杆的人，保卫祖国是我无上的职责。我永久忠实于革命事业，为革命事业誓死斗争到底。美帝国主义侵犯中国，我就站在最前线，和它决死战斗到底。为革命事业流最后一滴血，亦在所不惜。
