The People's Bank Prize Savings program, organized by the Beijing Municipal People's Bank, will begin accepting deposits for its first phase on the 21st of this month. To facilitate deposits for citizens, the bank has entrusted postal offices and private banks to handle deposit services. The postal offices include the Beijing Postal Administration and its affiliated branches, totaling twenty-four locations. The private banks include Shanghai Bank, Guohua Bank, China Industrial Bank, Xinhua Bank, Juxingcheng Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, Dalu Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and Zhongfu Bank, totaling ten institutions.

Since announcing the launch of prize savings, the bank has received enthusiastic support from citizens from all walks of life. Many citizens have visited the bank to inquire about deposit methods, and many have requested appointments or asked to convert their existing deposits with the bank into prize savings. Many institutions and organizations have also collectively pre-registered for deposits with the bank. Wang Jing, the principal of the Second Affiliated Elementary School of the Teachers' College, said: "Our savings and deposits are also beneficial to resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to defend our homes and country, because the state bank can centralize scattered social funds, enhance the strength of capital utilization, and give play to more useful avenues. I will definitely call on teachers, students, and staff to do their best to save." An old woman named Zhao said to the bank staff: "The prize savings method is really excellent, it guarantees both principal and value, is not affected by price fluctuations, and can also win prizes. The term is also short, and it is convenient to deposit tens of thousands of yuan each term. I will definitely save some money to deposit."

　　人民银行有奖储蓄
    二十一日开始收储
    京市人民银行举办的保本保值有奖储蓄，第一期自本月二十一日开始收储。该行为便利市民存储，特委托邮局和私营银行代办存储业务，邮局方面计有北京邮政管理局和所属各分局共二十四处，私营银行方面计有上海、国华、中国实业、新华、聚兴诚、中南、金城、大陆、浙江兴业、中孚等十家。
    该行自公布开办有奖储蓄以来，受到各界市民热烈拥护，许多市民去该行询问存储办法，并有许多人要求预约，或要求把原来存在该行的
  款改为有奖储蓄，也有不少机关团体已向该行集体预先登记存储。师大第二附小校长王静说：“我们节约储蓄也有利于抗美援朝保家卫国，因为国家银行可以集中社会零散资金，增强资金的使用力量，发挥到更有用的途径上去。我一定号召师生员工们尽力存储。”有一位赵老太太对银行人员说：“有奖储蓄的办法真好极了，既保本保值，不受物价涨落影响，又能得奖，期限又短，每期存几万全行，挺方便，我一定节省些钱储蓄起来。”
