　　The Whole Nation Stands Hand-in-Hand with You
    Lu Gong
    Foreword: On August 27, 1950, American imperialist planes invaded the airspace over Northeast China and strafed the Linjiang Railway Station. Driver Xu Guochen was injured by American planes while trying to protect the locomotive. All four fingers on his left hand, except for the thumb, were destroyed. On October 6th, he was discharged from the hospital and sent a letter of thanks to the people of all sectors across the country who had sent him their condolences. The "928" locomotive that was shot by the American plane has also been repaired. On October 1st, at the place where the American plane strafed, the workers drove the "928" locomotive to demonstrate against American imperialism.
  I. You Think of It All the Time...
    You'll never forget,
    The anger in your heart burns like fire...
    Your left hand is wounded,
    You will avenge with your right hand!
    Your eyes are glued to the letters of condolence,
    From Shanghai, Beijing...
    Look! More than three hundred letters, each stating clearly:
    "Blood debts must be paid by American imperialism!"
    You can't reply to each letter,
    You tell the people of the whole country:
    "My injury has healed,
    I have returned to my post..."
    You think of it all the time,
    American imperialism is going mad;
    The sound of cannons is heard on the border of the motherland,
    The anger in your heart burns to the sky!
    You said: "The American plane damaged my left hand,
    I will avenge with my right hand!"
    The whole nation stands hand-in-hand with you,
    Preparing to chop up the heads of the invading dogs!
    II. Locomotive No. "928" Runs Forward
    You see locomotive No. "928",
    You laugh with joy!
    Look how majestic and beautiful it is,
    Red flags fluttering on top!
    Everyone touches it with their hands,
    All cheering with their fists raised:
    "American imperialism cannot stop,
    No. 928 must keep running forward!"
    You walk up to the locomotive,
    Hard to find the scars;
    You touch your healed left hand,
    Saying, "We are both strong!"
    The whistle blows and the train starts,
    You sit next to the driver smiling slightly;
    Driving to the place where the American plane strafed,
    You open your throat and sing loudly!
    Locomotive No. "928" runs like flying,
    The red flag on the front of the car flutters in the wind...
    Whoever tries to stop us will perish,
    No one can stop the road ahead!

　　全国同胞和你拉着手
    路工
    前记：一九五○年八月二十七日，美帝国主义飞机侵入东北上空，扫射了临江车站，司机徐国臣。为了保护机车安全，竟遭美帝飞机打伤，左手除了大姆指以外，其余四个指头全被打坏了。十月六日，伤好出院，他向全国慰问他的各界人民致函感谢。被美机射伤的“九二八”号机车，也已经修复。十月一日，在美机扫射的地方，工人开着“九二八”号机车，向美帝示威。
  一、你时时刻刻都想到……
    你时时刻刻不会忘，
    你心头愤怒火样烧……
    你左手负了伤，
    你要用右手将仇报！
    你眼珠不转看着慰问信，
    来自上海、北京……
    看呀！三百多封一封封信都写明：
    “血债要叫美帝来还清！”
    你不能一封封去回信，
    你告诉全国同胞们：
    “我的伤已经好，
    我回到了工作岗位上……”
    你时时刻刻都想到，
    美帝国主义正疯狂；
    炮声传到祖国边境上，
    你心中怒火通天烧！
    你说：“美机打坏了我左手，
    我用右手来报仇！”
    全国同胞和你拉着手，
    准备切烂侵略者的狗头！
    二、“九二八”号机车朝前跑
    你见到机车“九二八”号，
    你高兴得哈哈大笑！
    你瞧它多威风，多漂亮，
    一面面红旗头上飘！
    大家用手去摸它，
    都喜欢得举起拳头叫：
    “美帝国主义不能阻挡，
    九二八号一直要向前跑！”
    你走到机车跟前，
    细看伤疤难发现；
    你摸着治好了的左手，
    说：“咱俩都壮健！”
    汽笛一叫车开了，
    你坐在司机身边微微笑；
    开到那美机扫射的地方，
    你放开喉咙高声唱！
    “九二八”号机车如飞跑，
    车头上红旗迎风呼呼飘……
    谁要阻挡谁灭亡，
    谁也挡不住前进道！
