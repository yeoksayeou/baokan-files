[Report from Our Newspaper] Readers from various locations have written to this newspaper expressing their determination to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend their country. Many readers have even written letters in blood to express their resolve to avenge the bloodshed and vow to exact a blood debt from American imperialism. Fu Ting of the Beijing Clothing Factory Cooperative submitted a blood letter to this newspaper. The original letter is as follows:

　　Under the iron heel of Japanese imperialism, I lived like an animal for eight years. I was beaten, I was cursed, and I was even imprisoned in a Japanese police station.

　　After the "August 15th" surrender of Japanese imperialism, American imperialism arrived. Its aggression and oppression against us were even worse than those of Japanese imperialism. From the time the American imperialists entered China on "August 15th" until they were driven out of the Chinese mainland, what did they do in China? In addition to political, military, and economic aggression, countless Chinese people were killed in car accidents, beaten to death, shot, and raped! These blood debts have not been repaid, and they are still vigorously aiding the public enemy of the Chinese people—Chiang Kai-shek—interfering with our liberation of Taiwan. Furthermore, they have frantically launched a war of aggression against Korea, infringing upon our country's territory, territorial waters, and airspace, and seeking to use Korea as a springboard to invade the Chinese mainland, invade Asia, and annex the world. These bloody acts of aggression are already clear to the Korean people, the Chinese people, and all peace-loving people around the world. We will never allow the aggressors to run rampant any longer. The Korean people and the Chinese people are as close as flesh and blood. The Chinese people must not remain indifferent. I express my attitude that, in addition to supporting the effort with practical work, I volunteer to go to Korea to participate in the war against the American aggressors, aid the Korean people, and at the same time achieve our goal of protecting our homes and defending our country.

　　This letter is written with my blood, which is to express my determination to resist America, aid Korea, protect my home, and defend my country.

　　誓向美帝索还血债
    读者向本报投递血书  表示抗美援朝的决心
    【本报讯】各地读者纷纷致函本报，表示抗美援朝保家卫国的决心，不少读者并用血写信表示要报血仇，誓向美帝索还血债。北京被服厂合作社傅挺即向本报投递血书，原信如下：
    在日本帝国主义的铁蹄下，过了八年的牛马生活，我挨过打，挨过骂，也住过日本警察署。
    在“八一五”日帝投降以后，又来了个美帝国主义。它对我们的侵略与压迫比起日本帝国主义来，有过之而无不及。美帝由“八一五”进来后直到滚出中国大陆止，它在中国干了些什么呢？除去政治、军事、经济的侵略外，我们中国人被撞死的、打死的、射杀的、强奸的不知有多少！这些血债未还，它还在大力援助中国人民的公敌——蒋介石，干涉我们解放台湾。它又进而疯狂地发动侵朝战争，侵犯我们祖国的领土、领海、领空，并要以朝鲜为跳板侵略中国大陆，侵略亚洲，吞并世界。这些血腥侵略的行为在朝鲜人民的面前，在中国人民的面前，在全世界爱好和平人民的面前，已经昭然若揭，我们决不允许侵略者再横行下去。朝鲜人民与中国人民是血肉相连的，中国人民决不能置之不理。我表示自己的态度，除去拿实际工作支援外，我志愿到朝鲜去参加抗击美国侵略者的战争，援助朝鲜人民，同时也就达到了我们保家卫国的目的。
    这封信是用我的血写出来的，也就是表示我的抗美援朝保家卫国的决心。
