The Chinese People's Volunteer Army, fighting side-by-side with the Korean People's Army to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, has achieved successive significant victories since October 25th. These victories have not only begun to transform the military situation in Korea but have also begun to thwart the rampant ferocity of the imperialist aggressors. The reactionary rulers of countries like the U.S. and Britain, under the joint blows of the Chinese and Korean peoples, have begun to sense the bleak future of their war of aggression against the Asian people, realize the error of their original calculation of occupying all of Korea and extending the flames of war to China, and are expressing panic and anxiety.

The imperialists originally thought they could act arbitrarily and do whatever they wanted in Korea. They originally thought that the Chinese people would be intimidated by the imperialist offensive and would therefore sit idly by while their close neighbor Korea was subjected to aggression, and would tolerate their own territory being threatened, bombed, and directly invaded. This is why the imperialists not only disregarded the Chinese people's proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue but also ordered the invading forces to advance madly north of the 38th parallel and towards the border of Northeast China. But the invaders now know that they have gone too far. The invaders, slightly sobered up by the blows they have received, began to worry that their mere hundreds of thousands of troops were simply not enough to "conquer" the 30 million people of all Korea, let alone resist the 475 million Chinese people. Although the U.S. invading forces and their accomplices have by no means abandoned their plans of aggression and resolved to accept a just and peaceful resolution, the shadow of final defeat is approaching them step by step.

The heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Korea has demonstrated to the world the Chinese people's great will to resolutely defend their hard-won victories. The Chinese people's liberation today was earned by countless patriots and people with lofty ideals over the past hundred years, especially in the last thirty years, who fought to the death against the imperialists and their running dogs, shedding their blood and sacrificing their lives. We have overthrown the hateful and dark rule of the imperialist running dog Chiang Kai-shek, but we have absolutely not forgotten that neither the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang nor imperialism itself will be reconciled to defeat, and are painstakingly plotting a comeback, to plunge the Chinese people back into a bloody hell on earth. The "spearheads" extended by U.S. imperialism in Korea, Japan, our Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, and the entire Southeast Asia are aimed not only at the local people but also at our mainland China. We have never relaxed our vigilance against all this. The outbreak of the Korean civil war orchestrated by the U.S. aggressors, and the U.S. government's immediate announcement of its aggression against Korea, its seizure of Taiwan, and its intervention in Vietnam and the Philippines, have suddenly made our environment tense. Our people and our government have repeatedly issued serious statements and protests regarding the situation in Korea and the issue of sovereignty over Taiwan. But the lawless imperialists are unreasonable; they regarded our mere issuance of statements and protests as a sign of weakness and vulnerability, and therefore intensified their harm and oppression to our independence and security. Our patriotic compatriots, having reached the limit of their tolerance, resolutely formed the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country, and fought side-by-side with the Korean People's Army, repelling the mad invading forces that had approached the Yalu River. Only then were the original arrogant plans of the imperialists shattered, and the sacred determination of our people to defend their hard-won victories recognized. Therefore, the struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is a life-and-death struggle concerning the fundamental interests of our nation, a concentrated expression of the great patriotic will of our 475 million compatriots. It is no accident that our compatriots across the country so warmly support the Volunteer Army, and that enthusiastic young people across the country have vowed to join the Volunteer Army.

The heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army is of decisive significance not only for the national survival of China and Korea but also of great significance for the safety of the Asian nations and the entire human race. If the imperialists' adventure in Korea succeeds, the armed invading bandits will use the banner of the "United Nations" to copy their actions everywhere. Then, not only will China bear the brunt, but the danger of war in other parts of the world will also be greatly increased. By crushing the dreams of the aggressors in Korea, we can protect the security of Korea and China, and we can also save world peace, which is in danger. The joint declaration of the Chinese democratic parties states: "If the peace-loving people of the world want to achieve peace, they must resist tyranny and stop aggression with active actions. Only resistance can teach the imperialists a lesson, and only then can the issues of independence and liberation in Korea and other regions be resolved fairly according to the will of the people." The glorious Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the glorious Korean People's Army are now standing on the front lines of defending world peace and resisting imperialist aggression, receiving the support, respect, and attention of all peace-loving and righteous people in the world.

As mentioned above, the imperialists have only just begun to be hit, and they will continue to act ferociously, so it is necessary to continue to give them a firm counterattack. Great Chinese and Korean warriors who are bravely fighting the imperialist invading forces on the Korean front! Braving the enemy's artillery fire and bombs, advance! Advance to achieve the final victory! Victory is inevitable: In front of you are only a group of wild beasts with limited numbers and low morale, and behind you are hundreds of millions of brave and righteous people who are determined to fight for national independence and world peace!

### 中国人民志愿部队抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大意义

　　中国人民志愿部队抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大意义
    中国人民抗美援朝保家卫国志愿部队与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，从十月二十五日以来已经连续得到重要胜利。这些胜利，不但已经开始转变了朝鲜的军事形势，而且已经开始挫折了帝国主义侵略者的猖狂的凶焰。美英等国反动统治者，在中朝两国人民的联合打击下，已经开始感觉到对于亚洲人民的侵略战争前途茫茫，感觉到他们原来的侵占全朝鲜并将战争火焰引向中国的如意算盘的错误，而表现惊慌和忧虑。
    帝国主义者原来以为，他们可以在朝鲜横行霸道，为所欲为。他们原来以为，中国人民将被帝国主义的进攻所吓倒，因而将坐视自己的紧邻朝鲜遭受侵略，将忍令自己的国土遭受威胁、轰炸和直接的侵略。这就是帝国主义者为什么不但不尊重中国人民和平解决朝鲜问题的主张，反而命令侵略军向三八线以北，向中国东北的边境疯狂前进的原故。但是侵略者们现在知道他们是跑得太远了。被打击得稍为清醒了一些的侵略者们屈指一算，开始忧虑他们的区区几十万军队究竟不足以“征服”全朝鲜的三千万人民，尤其不足以和四万七千五百万中国人民相对抗。尽管美国侵略军及其帮凶还远没有放弃自己的侵略计划而决心接受公正的和平解决，但是最后失败的阴影却在一步一步向他们挨近了。
    中国人民志愿部队在朝鲜的英勇奋斗，向全世界表示了中国人民坚决保卫自己的胜利果实的伟大意志。中国人民得到今天的解放，是一百多年来特别是近三十年来中国无数志士仁人向帝国主义者及其走狗奋死决战，抛头颅洒热血换来的。我们已经推翻了帝国主义走狗蒋介石的可恨的黑暗统治，但是我们绝对没有忘记，无论是蒋介石匪帮，或者是帝国主义本身，都不会甘心于失败，都在处心积虑地计划着卷土重来，把中国人民重新抛入血腥的人间地狱。美帝国主义在朝鲜，在日本，在我国的台湾，在菲律宾，在越南，在整个的东南亚所伸出的“长矛之尖”，不但是针对着当地的人民，而且是针对着我国大陆的，对于这一切我们从来没有放松过警惕。美国侵略者所布置的朝鲜内战的爆发，以及美国政府所立即随之宣布的对于朝鲜的侵略，对于台湾的夺取，对于越南菲律宾的干涉，使我国的环境顿然紧张起来了。我国人民和我国政府对于朝鲜形势和台湾主权问题再三发表了严重的声明和抗议。但是无法无天的帝国主义者是不讲道理的，他们把我国仅仅发出声明和抗议看作是怯弱可欺的表示，因而加紧了他们对于我国独立安全的危害和压迫。我国爱国同胞忍无可忍，毅然决然地组成了抗美援朝保家卫国志愿部队，和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，击退了已经逼近鸭绿江的疯狂的侵略军。只在这时，帝国主义者原定的狂妄的计划才被打破了，我国人民保卫胜利果实的神圣决心才被认识了。因此，中国人民志愿部队的斗争，乃是关系我国民族根本利益的生死斗争，乃是四万七千五百万同胞伟大爱国意志的集中表现，我全国同胞如此热烈拥护志愿部队，全国热血青年纷纷立誓要求参加志愿部队，完全不是偶然的。
    中国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军的英勇奋斗，不但对于中国和朝鲜的民族存亡有决定的意义，对于亚洲各民族和世界人类的安危也有极大的意义。帝国主义者在朝鲜的冒险如果得到成功，武装侵略的强盗们就会打着“联合国”的旗帜到处如法炮制，那时不但中国首当其冲，在世界其他地方的战争危险也就要极大地加重。在朝鲜击碎了侵略者的梦想，就可以保卫朝鲜和中国的安全，也可以挽救在危险中的世界和平。中国各民主党派联合宣言说：“世界上爱好和平的人民如果想要得到和平，就必须用积极行动来抵抗暴行，制止侵略。只有抵抗，才有可能使帝国主义者获得教训，才有可能按照人民的意志公正地解决朝鲜及其他地区的独立和解放的问题。”光荣的中国人民志愿部队和光荣的朝鲜人民军，现在正是站在捍卫世界和平抵抗帝国主义侵略的最前线，受着全世界爱好和平正义的人类的支援、崇敬和瞩望。
    如上所说，帝国主义者现在还只是开始受到打击，他们还要继续逞凶，因此必须继续给以坚决的反击。在朝鲜前线向帝国主义侵略军勇猛作战的中国和朝鲜的伟大勇士们！冒着敌人的炮火和炸弹，前进！前进去取得最后的胜利！胜利是必然的：在你们的前面只是一群数目有限士气不高的野兽，在你们的后面却是为祖国独立和世界和平而坚决奋斗的几万万英勇的正义的人民！
