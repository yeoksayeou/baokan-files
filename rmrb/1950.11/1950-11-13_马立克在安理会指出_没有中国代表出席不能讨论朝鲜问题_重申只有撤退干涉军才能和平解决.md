Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 12th: According to TASS, New York, November 11th: The Security Council met on the afternoon of November 10th, with the Palestine issue and the Korean issue included in the provisional agenda. The Korean issue was added to the agenda at the request of the United States, Britain, and France.

　　Prior to the meeting, newspapers authorized to speak predicted that the U.S. delegation would try to have the Korean issue discussed before the Palestine issue, and would present a proposal that the U.S. bloc had circulated to the representatives before the meeting.

　　The proposal submitted by the United States, Britain, France, Norway, Cuba, and Ecuador insisted that "Chinese Communist military units" had taken the side of North Korea and were "preparing for combat," and insisted that "no action should be taken that might lead to the expansion of the Korean conflict to other areas," "demanding that all countries and authorities… not aid or encourage the North Korean authorities, prevent their nationals or individual units or forces of their armed forces from aiding the North Korean army, and promote the immediate withdrawal of such nationals or individual units or forces now possibly in Korea."

　　Chairman Bebler pointed out at the beginning of the meeting that the meeting was originally convened to discuss the Palestine issue, but at the request of the United States, Britain, and France, the Korean issue was included in the agenda of November 9th. Bebler suggested that the Security Council should decide which issue to discuss first.

　　French representative Chauvel urged that the Korean issue be discussed first.

　　Egyptian representative Fawzi agreed with Chauvel's opinion and pointed out the "urgency" of the Korean issue.

　　Soviet representative Malik declared: There is no reason to discuss the "accusation of aggression against the Republic of Korea" on November 10th. Malik pointed out: This proposal was not included in the agenda distributed on November 8th. Malik said: The rules of procedure stipulate that the provisional agenda should be distributed three days before the discussion, and in urgent cases, the provisional agenda can be distributed at the same time as the meeting notice. However, neither of these provisions has been complied with. Malik pointed out: The new proposal was only put forward when the meeting was held on November 10th. The U.S. delegation has repeatedly violated not only the rules of procedure but also the Charter of the United Nations. Malik said: The only criterion for the U.S. delegation's behavior is the interests of the American ruling clique, and the United Nations Secretariat has had to bow to them.

　　Malik then pointed out: The U.S. attempt to force a discussion of the Korean issue on November 10th has an important aspect. Malik said: The Security Council has already passed a resolution on November 8th inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of all issues raised in MacArthur's report. It is necessary to know the opinions of the People's Republic of China. What right does the Security Council have to discuss events that have a major and direct impact on the interests of the Chinese people without the presence of a Chinese representative?

　　Malik pointed out the contradictory position of the U.S. delegation, saying: The Security Council decided in early October to invite a delegation from the People's Republic of China to participate in the Security Council's discussion of the case of armed aggression against Taiwan. The U.S. State Department took a month to issue entry visas to the representatives of the People's Republic of China so that they could come to Lake Success. It is said that the U.S. government only issued instructions to the U.S. representative in Prague on November 7th. Some suggest that this was done immediately after the U.S. elections ended. Malik said: He himself does not know if this is true, but the fact that entry visas have not been issued for a month is a fact.

　　Malik said: If the United States had issued entry visas quickly, representatives of the People's Republic of China might have already been at Lake Success. But now the United States insists on discussing these issues immediately, regardless of whether the representatives of the Chinese people have arrived.

　　Malik asked: Where is the logic in the U.S. delegation's position? No one would deny that the Korean issue is urgent. But it is also a fact that the representatives of the People's Republic of China invited by the Security Council cannot fly to Lake Success instantly. The U.S. delegation's disregard for these obvious facts raises doubts about the sincerity of the U.S. intentions.

　　Obviously, as in the past, the United States is attempting to prevent those countries whose interests are significantly affected from participating in the discussion of this issue. The United States is attempting to discuss the issue based on MacArthur's one-sided and ulterior motives report, and is attempting to force the world to accept MacArthur's words.

　　Malik said: The Security Council cannot discuss the Korean issue without the presence of a representative of the People's Republic of China. The Soviet delegation believes that this issue is urgent, but it is unfair, illegal, and at least too naive to discuss it solely based on MacArthur's one-sided report.

　　Malik then recounted that the U.S. Air Force under MacArthur's command had repeatedly violated Chinese airspace, bombed Chinese territory, and caused loss of life and property.

　　Because all the troops in Korea are commanded by MacArthur, and given MacArthur's hostility towards China, his report cannot be trusted. Because these reports come from an American general who, as he showed in his telegram to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, hates not only the Chinese people, but all the people of Asia.

　　As for the path to a peaceful resolution, there is only one, a path that the Soviet Union has insisted on since the Korean issue arose, and that is through the cessation of intervention and the withdrawal of interventionist forces.

　　Chairman Bebler said that there were two amendments to the provisional agenda—one was the French amendment to discuss the Korean issue first, and the other was the Soviet amendment to remove the Korean issue.

　　Indian representative Rau and British representative Jebb both acknowledged that the People's Government of China did not have enough time for its representatives to arrive at Lake Success, but both agreed to put the Korean issue at the top of the agenda. After their speeches, the Security Council rejected the Soviet amendment disagreeing with the inclusion of the Korean issue on the agenda. Only Malik voted in favor.

　　The Security Council then passed the French amendment to include the Korean issue on the agenda and prioritize its discussion. Nine members voted in favor, and Egypt abstained. The Soviet Union did not participate in the vote.

　　French representative Chauvel spoke in favor of the six-nation proposal.

　　Chauvel demanded that the government of the People's Republic of China recall the Chinese volunteer soldiers sent to Korea, and openly threatened the possible expansion of the Korean War.

　　British representative Jebb expressed agreement with Chauvel's opinion. He also threatened that the actions of Chinese volunteer soldiers in Korea—which he called China's "intervention"—would have "very serious and unpredictable consequences."

　　U.S. representative Austin, who spoke next, said: The purpose of the proposal put forward by the U.S., Britain, and other six countries is to quickly end the Korean War and ensure that the conflict does not expand.

　　Austin asserted: In the early days, China used spiritual support and equipment, as well as Korean combat troops in the Chinese army, to assist the North Koreans; he then said that a large number of Chinese troops had entered Korea.

　　Given the late hour, Security Council Chairman Bebler suggested adjourning the meeting. Egyptian representative Fawzi requested clarification on when the Security Council would reconvene to discuss the Palestine issue and when it would discuss the Korean issue. He said: If no one objects, the Security Council can meet on November 13th to discuss the Palestine issue, as requested by Palestine and Transjordan. Fawzi proposed that the timing of the Security Council's next meeting to discuss the Korean issue be decided by the chairman. The Security Council accepted this proposal without objection and adjourned the meeting.

### 马立克在安理会指出  没有中国代表出席不能讨论朝鲜问题  重申只有撤退干涉军才能和平解决

　　马立克在安理会指出
　  没有中国代表出席不能讨论朝鲜问题   
    重申只有撤退干涉军才能和平解决
    【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社纽约十一日讯：安理会于十一月十日下午开会，临时议程中包括巴勒斯坦问题和朝鲜问题。朝鲜问题是在美国、英国和法国要求下而列入议程的。
    在开会前，被授意发言的报纸消息预言，美国代表团将设法使朝鲜问题先巴勒斯坦问题而讨论，并将提出一项美国集团在开会前即交各代表传阅的提案。
    美国、英国、法国、挪威、古巴和厄瓜多尔所提的提案硬说道：“中共军事单位”已经站在北朝鲜一边而“展开准备作战”，并坚持“不应采取可能促使朝鲜冲突扩大至其他地区的行动”，“要求一切国家与当局者……不要援助或鼓励北朝鲜当局，阻止它们的国民或它们武装部队的个人或部队援助北朝鲜军队，并促使现在可能已在朝鲜的这类国民个人或部队立即撤退。”
    主席贝勃勒在会议开始时指出，会议的召开原来是为了讨论巴勒斯坦问题，但在美英法的要求下把朝鲜问题列入十一月九日的议程中，贝勃勒建议安理会应决定先讨论那一个问题。
    法国代表萧维尔敦促先讨论朝鲜问题。
    埃及代表法齐同意萧维尔的意见，并指出朝鲜问题的“紧急性”。
    苏联代表马立克宣称：在十一月十日讨论“控诉对大韩民国的侵略案”是没有理由的。马立克指出：在十一月八日散发的议程中并没有包括这一议案。马立克说：议事规则规定临时议程应在讨论前三天散发，而在紧急时，临时议程则可以与开会的通知同时散发。但这两项规定都没有遵守。马立克指出：仅仅在会议于十一月十日举行的时候才提出新的议案来。美国代表团屡次不仅违背了议事规则并且违背了联合国宪章。马立克说：美国代表团行为的唯一准则只是美国统治集团的利益，而联合国秘书处竟不得不向它们低头。
    马立克继即指出：美国硬要在十一月十日讨论朝鲜问题的企图有其重要的一面。马立克说：安理会在十一月八日已通过邀请中华人民共和国代表参加讨论麦克阿瑟报告所提出的一切问题的决议。获知中华人民共和国的意见是必要的。安全理事会有什么权利没有中国代表出席而讨论对中国人民的利益有重大而直接的影响的事件呢？
    马立克指出美国代表团的立场自相矛盾说：安全理事会十月初即已决定邀请中华人民共和国代表团参加安全理事会中关于武装侵略台湾案的讨论。美国国务院竟过了一个月之久仍未将入境签证发给中华人民共和国的代表，以使他们得能来到成功湖。据传说，美国政府到十一月七日才向美国驻布拉格代表发出训令。有人暗示那是在美国选举结束之后马上作的。马立克说：他本人不知道这是否真实，但一个月之久没有发给入境签证却是事实。
    马立克说：如果美国迅速发给入境签证，中华人民共和国代表可能早已经在成功湖了。而目前美国又坚持不顾中国人民的代表是不是已经来到，就马上来讨论这些问题。
    马立克问：美国代表团的立场的逻辑在那里呢？没有人会否认朝鲜问题是迫切的。但为安全理事会邀请的中华人民共和国代表不能腾云驾雾转瞬即到成功湖也是事实。美国代表团漠然不顾这种种显而易见的事实，使人对于美国意向的诚意，发生怀疑。
    显然像过去一样，美国企图不让那些利益受到重大影响的国家参加这个问题的讨论。美国企图根据麦克阿瑟片面的和别有用心的报告来讨论该问题，并且企图强迫全世界来接受麦克阿瑟的话。
    马立克说：没有中华人民共和国代表出席，安全理事会就不能讨论朝鲜问题。苏联代表团认为，这个问题是迫切的，但是仅仅根据麦克阿瑟片面的报告来讨论便是不公平、不合法的，至少也是太天真了。
    马立克继而追述，麦克阿瑟指挥下的美国空军曾数度侵犯中国领空，轰炸中国领土，造成生命财产的损失。
    因为所有在朝鲜的部队都是麦克阿瑟所指挥的，而且鉴于麦克阿瑟对中国的仇视，他的报告是不能博得信任的。因为这些报告是出之于这样一个美国将军之手：即如他在致《国外战争退伍军人协会》电文中所显示的，他不仅仅仇视中国人民，而且仇视全亚洲的人民。
    至于谈和平解决的途径，那只有一条，自从朝鲜问题发生以来苏联就坚持主张的一条途径，这就是经由停止干涉和撤退干涉军的途径。
    主席贝勃勒称，对临时议程有两个修正案——一个是法国所提尽先讨论朝鲜问题的修正案，一个是苏联所提将朝鲜问题去除的修正案。
    印度代表劳氏与英国代表杰伯在发言时都承认中国人民政府没有足够的时间使其代表到达成功湖，但两人都赞成把朝鲜问题列入议程之首，在他们发言以后，安理会就否决了苏联所提不同意将朝鲜问题列入议程的修正案。仅有马立克投赞成票。
    安理会于是通过法国所提关于把朝鲜问题列入议程并尽先予以讨论的修正案。有九个理事国投票赞成，埃及弃权。苏联没有参加投票。
    法国代表萧维尔发言表示赞成六国提案。
    萧维尔要求中华人民共和国政府召回派往朝鲜的中国志愿兵，并露骨地以朝鲜战争可能扩大相威胁。
    英国代表杰伯表示同意萧维尔的意见。他也提出威胁说，中国志愿兵在朝鲜的行动——他称为中国的“干涉”——继续下去将有“非常严重而且不可预料的后果”。
    接着发言的美国代表奥斯汀说：美英等六国所提出的提案的目的在迅速结束朝鲜战争和确保冲突不致扩大。
    奥斯汀断言：在早期，中国曾用精神上的支持和装备以及中国军队中的朝鲜战斗部队来援助北朝鲜人；他接着说现在大量中国军队已进入朝鲜。
    鉴于时间已晚，安全理事会主席贝勃勒建议休会。埃及代表法齐要求说明一下安全理事会何时再度开会讨论巴勒斯坦问题、何时讨论朝鲜问题。他说：如果没有人反对的话，安全理事会可以按照巴勒斯坦和外约但的要求，在十一月十三日开会讨论巴勒斯坦问题。法齐提议安全理事会何时召集讨论朝鲜问题的下一次会议由主席裁夺决定。安全理事会无异议地接受了这个提议，旋即休会。
