Beijing Cultural Centers and Reading Rooms Gain Experience in Anti-American Aggression and Aid-Korea Propaganda

[This Newspaper's News] Since the Beijing municipal cultural centers and reading rooms launched the "Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country" propaganda campaign, they have gained considerable experience.

The propaganda activities of the various centers and rooms mainly take the form of seminars, accusation meetings, wall newspapers, large-character posters, blackboard newspapers, cartoons, comic dialogues, fast-clapping rhymes, peep shows, and radio broadcasts. They are based on the situation of the nearby residents and enriched with new content. For example, the First and Seventh Cultural Centers held current affairs seminars, targeting workers and women respectively, with preparation in advance, which made the discussions more in-depth. Regarding wall newspapers, the Thirteenth Reading Room paid attention to incorporating the masses' thinking, with each wall newspaper addressing only one issue, such as "Korean people are not 'Goryeo sticks'" or "Atomic bombs are not scary," etc. At the same time, cartoons were interspersed to complement the content of the wall newspaper, which was more welcomed by the masses. The Third Cultural Center raised questions in the "Reader Q&A" column, soliciting answers from readers, and also answering readers' questions. The wall newspaper of the Fourteenth Reading Room adopted forms such as comic dialogues and fast-clapping rhymes, which were more easily accepted by the masses than lengthy arguments. The Third Cultural Center rehearsed street plays based on real people and real events, performed by people who had personally suffered from the persecution of American imperialism, which particularly moved the audience. The Fourth Cultural Center first understood the masses' thinking through activists among the masses, and then carried out propaganda, which made the work much easier. In the Eighth Reading Room, where there were many Hui people, the Hui imam used verses from the Koran about loving peace and opposing aggression to educate the Hui people. The Second Cultural Center spent a few tens of minutes during mass reading time to talk about current affairs and answer questions raised by the masses; the use of recitation in broadcasting was more effective than lectures.

Accusation meetings are also a powerful form of propaganda. The First, Third, Fourth, and Seventh Cultural Centers have all held "Accusation Meetings on the Atrocities of American Imperialism," which have achieved certain results. However, accusation meetings must first discover typical examples among the masses in advance, so that they can better stimulate the emotions of the masses when the meeting is held. Some reading rooms have gathered books and magazines related to "Resist America, Aid Korea" and written brief introductions to facilitate mass reading.

In order to summarize the propaganda work of resisting America and aiding Korea and exchange experiences, the centers and rooms held a joint meeting on the 19th. The meeting unanimously recognized that the "Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country" movement is a long-term one, and the future work is how to carry out propaganda to the citizens more universally, deeply, and meticulously, and strengthen the ideological education against American imperialist aggression. The following points should be noted in the work:

1.  The centers and rooms should establish close contact and cooperation with relevant parties, such as the district offices, police stations, district committees, district women's federations, schools, and professional art troupes.
2.  Mobilize and cultivate mass propagandists.
3.  All possible propaganda methods should be utilized. The propaganda content must be specific and should be gradually changed according to the degree of awareness of the masses at each stage, and should not remain at the level of empty slogans.
4.  Centralized propaganda materials such as pictures, propaganda posters, cartoons, etc., should be displayed on tour in various centers and rooms.
5.  Strengthen the current affairs study of cadres.

    抗美援朝宣传获经验
    【本报讯】京市各文化馆、书报阅览室自展开“抗美援朝保家卫国”的宣传活动以来，已收到不少经验。
    各馆、室的宣传活动主要是通过座谈会、控诉会、壁报、大字报、黑板报、漫画、相声、快板、拉洋片、广播等方式，根据附近居民情况充实新的内容来进行的。如第一、第七文化馆举行时事座谈会时分别工人、妇女等不同对象有准备地进行，谈话就比较深入。关于出壁报，第十三阅览室注意结合群众思想，每个壁报只解决一个问题，如“朝鲜人民不是高丽棒子”或“原子弹不可怕”等等；同时用漫画配合壁报内容穿插排列，更为群众所欢迎。第三文化馆在“读者问答栏”内提出问题，征求读者解答，同时也解答读者的问题。第十四阅览室的壁报采用了对口相声和快板等形式，比长篇大论易为群众接受。第三文化馆以真人真事排演街头剧，由亲身受过美帝迫害的人表演，使观众特别受感动。第四文化馆先通过群众中的积极分子了解群众思想情况，然后进行宣传，使工作得到很多便利。第八阅览室当地回民较多，回民教长引用了可兰经里面爱和平反侵略的话来教育回民群众。第二文化馆在群众阅览时抽出数十分钟的时间来讲时事，并解答群众提出的问题；在广播时采用了朗诵的方式，比讲说收效大。
    控诉会也是一个有力的宣传方式，第一、三、四、七文化馆都举行过“美帝暴行控诉会”，收得了一定的效果，但控诉会必须事先在群众中发现典型的例子，开会时才更能激发群众情绪。有些阅览室将有关“抗美援朝”的书籍杂志集中起来，并写出简短的介绍，以便群众阅览。
    为了总结抗美援朝的宣传工作并交流经验，各馆、室于十九日举行了联席会议。会上一致认识到“抗美援朝保家卫国”的运动是长期的，今后的工作是如何更普遍、深入、细致地向市民进行宣传，加强反对美帝侵略的思想教育。在工作中应注意下面几点：
    一、各馆、室应与各有关方面，如区公所、派出所、区委、区妇联、学校及文艺专业团体等取得密切的联系与配合。
    二、发动和培养群众宣传员。
    三、应利用一切可能利用的宣传方式。宣传内容必须具体，并应根据各个时期群众觉悟的程度逐渐改变，不能停留在空喊口号上。
    四、集中宣传材料如图片、宣传画、漫画等，在各馆、室巡回展览。
    五、加强干部时事学习。
