Developing Political Power Construction in Major Urban Areas

    The experience of establishing political power in cities such as Beijing and Guangzhou over the past year has proven that, under the centralized leadership of the Municipal People's Government, major cities need to establish district-level organs of political power to assist the Municipal People's Government in implementing its policies and promoting its various tasks. Now, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government has promulgated the "Organic Rules for Urban District People's Representative Conferences" and the "Organic Rules for Urban District People's Governments." In the future, all major cities across the country will carry out the construction of district political power based on these two sets of rules, further promoting people's democracy, forging closer ties between the government and the people, enabling people's opinions to be reflected to the government more promptly through the district people's representative conferences, and enabling the government's policies and laws to be implemented more deeply among the masses through the district people's representative conferences, thus consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship in major cities.
    According to Beijing's experience, when convening district people's representative conferences, whether it be publicity, elections, or meetings, the principles of simplicity, ease of implementation, convenience for the masses, and maximum saving of the masses' time should be followed. Before the meeting, there should be extensive and in-depth publicity work to make the masses understand the significance, role, and methods of the district representative conference. However, publicity should avoid high-sounding and irrelevant rhetoric that annoys the masses. In fact, the masses' understanding of the representative conference will gradually deepen not only through publicity and education but also through practical experience of the conference. Regarding the method of electing representatives, at present, it is not possible to implement universal suffrage based on individual citizens; only simple methods can be adopted to nominate representatives. In addition to representatives being nominated by various professional organizations, organs, and parties, the selection of resident representatives should be handled flexibly based on the actual situation. Beijing's method of nominating representatives based on households (one person per household) can be used as a reference for other regions. During the meeting, issues should be raised and discussed directly, and attention should be paid to adopting methods that facilitate the people's expression of their opinions so that representatives can speak freely. When holding meetings for the first time, the masses may raise many issues, but each meeting can only select several urgent issues that need to be resolved and address them with a focus on their importance and urgency; it should not be hoped that all issues can be resolved in one meeting.
    While carrying out publicity and election work, attention should be paid to soliciting the masses' opinions on the work of the government and the style of the cadres, and the people's representatives' examination and criticism of the work of the government and the style of the cadres should be listened to with an open mind at the meeting. Relevant personnel should conduct self-criticism conscientiously, responsibly, sincerely, and frankly, to deepen the masses' trust in the People's Government, improve the relationship between cadres and the masses, improve work, and overcome bureaucracy and commandism.
    Strengthening the construction of district political power does not mean relaxing the unified and centralized leadership of the city. The district government is a level of political power that realizes leadership by district under the centralized leadership of the city; realizing leadership by district is not for decentralization but for better centralization. All city-wide issues should still be centrally resolved by the city. The district can only be directed by the city and execute certain work tasks under the city's unified principles and policies. Its scope of work should be determined by its work development and various specific conditions. It is more appropriate to go from small to large and from few to many. It is inappropriate for some large cities to push too many tasks that cannot be independently carried out by the district to the district at once, without considering the actual situation of the district. In addition, problems that the city cannot manage but can be solved by the district should be handled by the district. Major cities should pay special attention to these two points when establishing district political power.
    Exercising democracy towards the people and exercising dictatorship over counter-revolutionaries are two inseparable aspects of the same issue. In-depth construction of the people's political power in major cities will make people's democracy more developed; at the same time, the dictatorship over counter-revolutionaries will also be more powerful. The powers of the district people's representative conferences stipulate that they should assist the People's Government in maintaining public order and consolidating revolutionary order; the working organs of the district people's government stipulate that one to three civil affairs cadres should be set up in the public security sub-stations. This not only makes it extremely convenient for residents to contact the government when they have something to do but also enables the public security sub-stations to establish close contact with the masses and to achieve division of labor, responsibility, and cooperation due to the presence of dedicated personnel to manage civil affairs work. This has positive significance for strengthening public security work and civil affairs work.

### 开展大城市区的政权建设

　　开展大城市区的政权建设
    一年来北京、广州等城市建政的经验证明，大城市在市人民政府的集中领导下，需要设立区一级政权机关，以为市人民政府贯彻施政方针和推行各项工作的助手。现在中央人民政府政务院颁布了大城市区人民代表会议组织通则和大城市区人民政府组织通则；今后全国各大城市都将依据这两项通则开展区的政权建设，进一步发扬人民民主，使政府与人民有更加密切的联系，使人民的意见经过区人民代表会议更及时地反映到政府中来，也使政府的政策法令经过区人民代表会议更能深入地贯彻到群众中去，使大城市人民民主专政的政权更加巩固。
    根据北京市的经验，召开区人民代表会议时，无论宣传、选举、开会等，都应该以简便易行，便利群众和尽量节省群众时间为原则。开会前要有广泛深入的宣传工作，使群众了解区代表会议的意义、作用与开法。但宣传时切忌高谈阔论，不着边际，使群众不胜其烦。事实上群众对代表会的认识，除宣传教育以外，还要经过会议的实际体验，才会逐渐加深的。在代表的选举方法上，目前还不能以公民个人为基础实行普选，只能采取简便的方式来推选代表。除由各职业团体和机关党派自行推选代表外，居民代表的产生应依据实际情况灵活办理。北京市以户为基础（每户一人）推选代表的办法可供各地参考。开会时应直截了当地提出问题，讨论问题，同时要注意采取便利于人民表达自己意见的方式方法，使代表们能够畅所欲言。初次召开会议的时候，群众提出的问题可能很多，但每次会议只能分别缓急轻重，选择若干急待解决的问题有重点地加以解决，不能希望在一次会议上解决一切问题。
    在宣传选举工作的同时，应注意吸收群众对政府工作及干部作风的意见，并在会议上虚心听取人民代表对政府工作及干部作风的检查与批评。各有关人员则应认真负责、诚恳坦白地作自我批评，用以加深群众对人民政府的信任，改善干部与群众的关系，改进工作，克服官僚主义与命令主义。
    加强区政权建设，并不是放松市的统一集中领导。区政府是在市的集中领导下，分区实现领导的一级政权；分区实现领导不是为了分散而是为了更好的集中。凡是属于全市性的问题仍应集中于市统一解决，区只能在市的统一方针政策下受市的指挥，执行一定的工作任务。它的工作范围，应该看它的工作发展和各种具体条件来确定，由小而大由少而多是比较妥当的。有的大城市不顾及区的实际情况，一下子把太多的和不能由区独立进行的工作都推到区去执行，这样是不妥当的。另外，市里管不到的可能由区解决的问题，则应由区处理。各大城市在建立区政权时应该特别注意这两点。
    对人民实行民主和对反革命实行专政，这是一个问题不可分割的两面。深入建设大城市人民政权，将使人民民主更加发扬；而同时对反革命的专政也更有力。区各界人民代表会议的职权规定有协助人民政府维持治安、巩固革命秩序的一项；区人民政府的工作机构中，又规定在公安派出所内设民政干事一至三人。这样就不但使居民有事和政府发生联系时极为方便，而且使公安派出所可以与群众发生密切联系，并因有专人管理民政工作而收到分工负责、通力合作之效。这样对于公安工作与民政工作的加强，都有积极的意义。
