　　Over 900 Faculty and Staff at Peking University
    Initiate Covenant Movement to Reject Listening to "Voice of America"
    Peiman Students Issue Declaration Against Listening to "Voice of America"
    [This Newspaper's News] The 961 faculty and staff members of Peking University feel extremely indignant at the "Voice of America" for frequently spreading shameless rumors and confusing listeners. They unanimously and consciously agreed to never listen to "Voice of America" and initiated a "Movement for Covenant to Reject Listening to 'Voice of America'," calling on the people of the whole country to immediately and consciously take action, mobilize relatives, friends, neighbors, and colleagues, sign the covenant separately, and encourage each other at any time, in order to give the American imperialists another head-on blow on the ideological battlefield.
    The covenant to reject listening to "Voice of America" states: In order to resolutely resist the vicious ideological aggression of American imperialism and strengthen our overall strength against American aggression, we agree that we will never listen to the "Voice of America" that paralyzes our minds. We hereby make this agreement to encourage each other and strive to expand this movement of refusing to listen to "Voice of America."
    [Another News] All the students of Peiman Girls' Middle School in Beijing issued a declaration against listening to "Voice of America." In addition to ensuring that they will never listen to it, they also request people from all walks of life to consciously not listen to "Voice of America."
