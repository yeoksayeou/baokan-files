　　Defend Our Freedom and Happiness!
　　We, the youth who grew up during the War of Resistance, must never allow the American imperialists to slaughter our young siblings and elderly parents again.
　　Zhai Liansheng
　　Editor's Note: Comrade Zhai Liansheng is currently working in personnel at the Beijing Transportation Company. He is from Jingxian County, Hebei Province. He was only eleven or twelve years old when the War of Resistance Against Japan began. After his hometown was occupied, he witnessed the various atrocities of the Japanese invaders. Therefore, he powerfully expresses the Chinese people's hatred and will towards the invaders in his article.
　　Fellow patriotic Chinese men and women, youth! Recalling the atrocities of the Japanese imperialists when they invaded our country, the way they harmed the Chinese people is unimaginable. At that time, we were very young and had no power to resist, so we could only be arbitrarily ravaged by the Japanese devils. Some children were so frightened that they ran to their mothers' arms crying. But the mothers who had lost their country could not protect their children. Our young lives were killed one by one by the Japanese devils! The imperialists used inhumane means to try to destroy our country and exterminate our race, implementing the "Three Alls Policy" and using all kinds of vicious methods. Many houses were burned down, things were looted, and many children who had lost their parents and homes crawled on their mothers' corpses, crying their hearts out, their bodies stained with their mothers' blood! But those imperialist demons were laughing and yelling on the side. The inhumane imperialists regarded the tragic scene of slaughtering Chinese people as their entertainment!
　　Compatriots, fathers, brothers, sisters! These tragedies of the Japanese imperialists slaughtering the Chinese people are deeply imprinted in the minds of millions of Chinese youth, and are also experienced by the 475 million people of China.
　　Fortunately, Chairman Mao and the Communist Party came! The People's Red Army went through the Long March of 25,000 li, enduring all kinds of hardships, eating grass roots and tree bark along the way, single-mindedly going north to resist Japan. The People's Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army quickly established base areas behind enemy lines, established the people's armed forces, and persisted in the eight-year arduous War of Resistance Against Japan, finally defeating the Japanese imperialists and forcing them to surrender unconditionally.
　　The hateful traitor Chiang Kai-shek recognized imperialists as his fathers. After Japan surrendered, he wanted to seize and monopolize the fruits of the people's victory, sell out all kinds of Chinese rights, collude with American imperialism, exchange cannons to kill the Chinese people, and attempt to turn China into a colony of the American imperialists, forever serving as slaves to imperialism.
　　Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the heroic and tenacious People's Liberation Army, for the sake of the people's independence and happiness, disregarded all sacrifices, bloodshed and difficulties, and persisted in the three-year liberation struggle. They drove the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, armed by the US imperialists, out of mainland China, liberating the people of the whole country, establishing the free and happy People's Republic of China, and allowing the Chinese people to begin a new life of unprecedented freedom and happiness! Now, American imperialism is following the old path of the Japanese devils, invading Korea, killing our neighbors, and seriously threatening our country's security. It has already occupied our territory of Taiwan, repeatedly invaded our airspace, destroyed our buildings, and killed our beloved compatriots, owing us a blood debt. Blood debt must be repaid in blood! Fellow patriotic Chinese men and women! We have suffered the cruel ravages of the Japanese devils. We must never allow the American imperialists to invade us again. We must not sit idly by. We must take practical actions to resist America and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. We must never tolerate the American imperialists invading our free and happy new China, and slaughtering our young siblings and elderly parents.

　　保卫我们的自由幸福！
    我们在抗战中成长起来的青年，决不能再让美帝来残杀我们年幼的弟妹和年迈的父母。
    翟连生
    编者按：翟连生同志现在北京市搬运公司作人事工作。他是河北省景县人，抗日战争开始才十一、二岁，家乡沦陷后，曾目睹日寇的种种暴行。因此，他在文中有力地表达了中国人民对于侵略者的仇恨的感情和意志。
    热血的中华男女青年同胞们：回想日本帝国主义者侵略我国的时候，那种残害中国人民的暴行是使人不可想像的。当那时候，我们还很小，没有反抗力量，只能受日本鬼的任意蹂躏。有的孩子竟吓得神飞魂散，跑到妈妈怀里去哭。那知道失去祖国的妈妈不能保护自己的孩子，我们的幼小的生命曾一个个被日本鬼子杀死！帝国主义用了惨无人道的手段，想叫我们亡国灭种，实行了三光政策，用尽了各种毒辣手段。许多房子被烧了，东西被抢光了，很多失去父母无家可归的孩子，竟爬在母亲的尸体上，把心都哭碎了，身上染满了母亲的鲜血！但那些帝国主义的恶魔们，却在一边鬼叫的笑着。惨无人道的帝国主义者把残杀中国人的悲惨局面、看成他们的娱乐场！
    同胞们，父老兄弟姊妹们：日本帝国主义者残杀中国人民的这些惨剧深深的印在中国千万青年的脑子里，同时也是中国四亿七千五百万人民所体验到的。
    幸亏来了共产党毛主席！人民的工农红军经过了两万五千里的长征，受尽了千辛万苦，吃尽了沿途草根树皮，一心北上抗日，人民的八路军、新四军很快的建立了敌后根据地，建立了人民的武装，坚持了八年艰苦抗日战争，终于把日本帝国主义者打得无条件投降了。
    可恨的蒋匪卖国贼介石对帝国主义者认贼作父，日本投降后，它想夺取独吞人民的胜利果实，出卖了中国各种权利，勾结美帝国主义，换来了大炮杀害中国人民，企图把中国变成美帝国主义者的殖民地永远当帝国主义的奴隶。
    英勇顽强的人民解放军在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，为了人民的独立幸福，不顾一切牺牲流血和困难，又坚持了三年解放斗争。把美帝所武装的蒋匪反动派赶出了中国大陆以外，使全国人民得到了解放，建立了自由幸福的中华人民共和国，使中国人民开始了有史以来所未有的自由幸福的新生活！现在，美帝国主义又走着日本鬼子侵略者的老路，侵略朝鲜，杀害我们的邻人，并严重威胁我国安全，并已经侵占了我们的领土台湾，一再侵入我国领空，破坏了我们的建筑物，杀死了我们亲爱的同胞，欠了我们的血债。血债要用血来还！热血的中华男女同胞们！我们受尽了日本鬼子侵略者的残酷蹂躏，我们决不能再让美帝来侵略我们。我们决不能坐视不理。我们要拿出实际行动来抗美援朝保家卫国，誓死也不能容忍美帝国主义者来侵略我们自由幸福的新中国，来残杀我们年幼的弟妹和年迈的父母。
