　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 5th (TASS): Today's *Truth* published Ma Lining's international commentary discussing the final stage of preparations for the Second World Congress of the Defenders of Peace, stating: The upcoming Congress is an event of the greatest international significance. In all countries around the world, honest people link their most ardent hopes and aspirations, and their belief in the inevitable victory of the great cause of peace, with this World Congress of the Defenders of Peace. Ma Lining further pointed out: Despite the fact that the imperialist reactionaries have put all their strength into the struggle to suppress the solemn movement of peace defenders, they still cannot stop the irresistible and rapid growth of the peace movement. The success of the signature campaign for the Stockholm Appeal has most convincingly proven this point, and this signature campaign is far from over. In the past seven months, approximately 500 million people have signed the declaration.

    Ma Lining said: In the past year, the various tactics and means used by Truman and Attlee, Acheson and Bevin in the ideological sphere to undermine the world peace movement have failed one after another. Their attempts to portray the peace movement as a purely narrow communist movement have long been shattered. Under the banner of fighting against imperialist aggression, a solid people's front has been formed, and the people of all countries are united in their determination to relieve mankind of the terror and disaster of a new world war.

    Ma Lining continued: The imperialist reactionaries, frightened and enraged by the rising peace movement, have resorted to the most disgusting measures. They threw into prison the active fighters who fought for the peace declaration, persecuted them, and deprived them of their job opportunities. At the same time, the reactionaries desperately despise the practical importance of the movement to defend peace, and try their best to undermine and paralyze it. Recently, British Prime Minister Attlee once again engaged in a vicious and slanderous campaign against the peace fighters. Attlee's provocative speech has aroused countless protests from British progressives.

    The Anglo-American imperialists are becoming more and more brazen. The Fifth General Assembly of the United Nations has shown that the American ruling clique unreasonably rejects all proposals put forward by the Soviet Union aimed at easing the tense international situation, ensuring peaceful cooperation among major powers, and consolidating international peace and security. They are trying their best to expand their aggression in Korea in order to incite the flames of world war. The American imperialists have made the United Nations organization into their servant, and are trying their best to turn them into a docile puppet to promote their policies of aggression and international adventure.

    In conclusion, Ma Lining emphasized: The peace defenders are responding to the conspiracies of the warmongers by consolidating their ranks, expanding and intensifying the struggle for peace. The Second World Congress of the Defenders of Peace will surely write a glorious page in the history of the struggle for peace by the people of all countries in the world.

　　二届和大前夕的国际形势
    马里宁
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科五日电：今日的真理报发表了马里宁的国际述评，论述第二届世界保卫和平大会筹备工作的最后阶段称：行将举行的大会，是具有最伟大的国际意义的事件。在全世界所有一切国家中，正直的人民都把他们最热衷的希望和志愿、以及他们对于伟大的和平事业必胜的信念，跟本届世界保卫和平大会联系起来。马里宁进一步指出：帝国主义反动分子们尽管把他们的一切力量都投入为压制和平保卫者的庄严运动而进行的斗争中，他们依然无法阻止那和平运动势不可挡的迅速成长。为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名运动的成绩，已最令人信服地证明了这一点，而这种签名运动距离结束还远呢。七个月来，已约有五万万人民在这宣言上签名了。
    马里宁说：过去一年来，杜鲁门和艾德礼、艾奇逊和贝文为了破坏世界和平运动而在思想领域中所用的种种策略手段，已相继失败。他们要把和平运动说成了纯粹是共产主义的狭隘的运动，他们的这一切企图早已被打破了。在为反对帝国主义侵略而斗争的旗帜下，坚实的人民阵线形成了，各国人民万众一心，一定要为人类解除新世界大战的恐怖与灾难。
    马里宁继称：帝国主义反动分子，反对日益高涨的和平运动而色厉内荏，恼羞成怒，使用了最令人作呕的措施。把那些为和平宣言而奋斗的积极战士们投入监狱，迫害他们，使他们丧失工作机会。同时，反动分子们拼命藐视保卫和平运动的实际重要性，竭力破坏这种运动，想使这种运动陷于麻痹。最近，英国首相艾德礼再度从事恶毒的诽谤性的攻击和平斗士们的运动。艾德礼的挑拨性的演说已引起英国进步人士的无数抗议。
    英美帝国主义者们越来越厚颜无耻了。联合国第五届大会已表明了，美国统治集团无理拒绝苏联所提出的，旨在缓和紧张的国际形势，确保大国间的和平合作，并且巩固国际和平与安全的一切提案。他们竭力要扩大他们在朝鲜的侵略，以便煽动世界大战的火焰。美国帝国主义者们使联合国组织于他们的奴仆的地位，竭力要把他们变成推行他们的侵略与国际冒险政策的百依百顺的傀儡。
    马里宁在结语中强调称：和平保卫者们正用巩固他们的队伍、扩大和加紧为和平而进行的斗争，来回答战争贩子们的阴谋。第二届世界保卫和平大会必将在全世界各国人民为保卫和平而进行的斗争史上写下光辉的一页。
