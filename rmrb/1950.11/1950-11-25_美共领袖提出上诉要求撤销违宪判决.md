Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 22nd: TASS Washington, November 22nd: Lawyers defending the eleven leaders of the Communist Party of the United States have submitted a legal brief to the U.S. Supreme Court, supporting their demand for the reversal of the unconstitutional verdict of the New York Federal Court.

Since the Supreme Court only agreed to investigate the constitutional issues related to the case, the main content of the defense brief is to explain the unconstitutionality of the Smith Act, under which the Communist leaders were convicted through illegal trial procedures.

According to the U.S. government, in order to advance war preparations and intensify domestic fascism, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, based on the unconstitutional Smith Act, filed public charges on July 20, 1948, against twelve leaders of the Communist Party of the United States, accusing them of “conspiracy” and “organizing the Communist Party” to engage in the “teaching and advocating” of Marxist-Leninist principles. The case opened in federal court on January 17th of last year and continued until September. Finally, on October 21st, the federal court sentenced eleven of the CPUSA leaders, including General Secretary Dennis (Chairman Foster was handled separately due to illness), to five years in prison and a fine of $10,000 each. The court also denied their bail rights. After strong protests from the CPUSA leaders and progressive people, the court was forced to grant bail pending appeal.

　　美共领袖提出上诉要求撤销违宪判决
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社华盛顿二十二日讯：为美国共产党十一位领袖辩护的律师已向美国最高法院提出法律辩护状，支持他们所提撤销纽约联邦法院违宪判决的要求。
    由于最高法院只同意调查该案的有关宪法的问题，因此辩护状主要内容是说明史密斯法案的违宪性，共产党领袖就是依照该法以非法审判手续被判有罪的。
    按美国政府为了推进备战计划和加紧国内法西斯化，由纽约南区地方法院根据违宪的史密斯法，于一九四八年七月二十日对美共十二名领袖提起公诉，罪名为“阴谋”“组织共产党”从事马列主义原则的“教导和主张”。该案于去年一月十七日起在联邦法院开审，一直继续到九月，最后，联邦法院于十月二十一日判决美共总书记但尼斯等十一人（美共主席福斯特因病另行处理）各处徒刑五年，罚款一万元。法院并拒绝他们的保释权利，经美共领袖及进步人民的强烈抗议，始被迫答应保释进行上诉。
