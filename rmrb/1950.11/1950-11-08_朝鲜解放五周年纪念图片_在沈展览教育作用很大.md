Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 5th: The exhibition of pictures commemorating the fifth anniversary of the liberation of the Korean people, held in Shenyang, ended at the end of last month. During the nineteen-day exhibition period, a total of more than 70,000 workers, peasants, soldiers, and students visited. This exhibition played a significant role in supporting the current affairs education on resisting America and aiding Korea in the city. In the sixteen books of comments, which were filled with writing in the exhibition hall, almost every page contained stern and righteous questions about American imperialism. For example: "What reason does American imperialism have to support the Syngman Rhee puppet army in attacking the Korean people?" "What reason does American imperialism, far across the Pacific Ocean, have to send its troops to the East to invade the Korean people?" All the sentiments written by the audience also revealed their deep hatred for American imperialism and their fervent desire to directly assist the Korean people.

After viewing the exhibition, the Northeast Electric Power Administration Bureau and Shenyang No. 7 Middle School and other units specifically held symposiums. The exhibition propaganda team and the Northeast Daily jointly convened a post-exhibition symposium on the 26th of last month. Literary and art worker Wang Huanan, who was wounded in the People's Liberation War, said at the meeting: "If American imperialism dares to burn the flames of aggression to the borders of our motherland, I will definitely return to my post in the army and encourage our soldiers to fight bravely!"

　　朝鲜解放五周年纪念图片
    在沈展览教育作用很大
    【新华社沈阳五日电】在沈阳举行的朝鲜人民解放五周年纪念图片展览会，已于上月底结束。在十九天的展览期中，前往参观的工人、农民、战士、学生共达七万余人。这次展览会在配合该市进行的抗美援朝时事教育上起了很大作用。在展览室中写得满满的十六本感想录上，几乎每页都有对美帝国主义的词严义正的责问。例如：“美帝国主义有什么理由扶植李承晚傀儡军进攻朝鲜人民？”“远在太平洋彼岸的美帝国主义，凭什么理由要把自己的军队开到东方来侵略朝鲜人民？”在观众所写的所有感想中也流露着对美帝国主义切齿痛恨和要求直接援助朝鲜人民的热烈情绪。
    东北电业总局及沈阳市第七中学等单位看完展览会后，回去还专门开了座谈会。展览会宣传组与东北日报社并于上月二十六日联合召开了展览会观后座谈会，曾在人民解放战争中负伤的文艺工作者王化南在会上说：“如果美帝国主义胆敢把侵略的战火烧到我们祖国的边疆，我一定重新回到部队工作岗位去，鼓舞我们的战士英勇斗争！”
