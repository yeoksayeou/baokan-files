　　The Current Stage of Postal and Telecommunications Work
    Shen Guang

    I. General Work Situation

    People's Posts and Telecommunications has grown and strengthened during the People's Liberation War. Due to the victory of the Liberation War across the country, postal and telecommunications services have experienced unprecedented rapid development. At present, a vast postal and telecommunications network has been restored and built both domestically and internationally.

    In terms of postal services, according to statistics, there are currently 3,662 post offices nationwide, and 50,097 other postal establishments such as postal kiosks, postal service stations, agency outlets, village and town letter boxes, postal stations, and stamp sales points, totaling 53,759, equivalent to 93% of the number in 1936. The distribution is more concentrated in East China and least in Northwest China.

    The total length of postal routes is now 871,425 kilometers, an increase of 49% compared to 1936. The distribution is also most concentrated in East China. According to category statistics: aviation accounts for 0.95%, trains 2.64%, automobiles 5.45%, waterways 8.89%, and land transport 82.07%. Postal routes operated by post offices themselves account for approximately 78% of the total mileage, with human labor accounting for 96% of this. Automobile postal routes total 8,380 kilometers, connecting Lanzhou with Dihua, Ningxia, Baotou, Xining, and Xi'an, and then south to Chengdu, Chongqing, and Guiyang, connecting with Qujing on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and Duyun on the Qian-Gui Railway respectively. These self-operated automobile postal routes not only undertake mail transportation tasks but also play a significant role in the transportation construction of the Northwest and Southwest regions. Recently, the Dihua to Horgos postal vehicle line on the Sino-Soviet border was opened, playing a considerable role in connecting postal transport between China and the Soviet Union.

    Regarding the development of postal services, according to statistics from the first half of this year, post offices in various regions across the country received and sent a total of 303.8 million letters and over 1.9 million parcels. The distribution of books and newspapers, except for North China, Northeast China, and Shandong, which had a foundation before 1949, has been recently launched. Since March 1st of this year, the entire People's Daily in Beijing has been distributed by post offices, and many domestic newspapers and magazines have also been distributed by post offices one after another. It is estimated that the distribution of newspapers and periodicals was 20.83 million copies in January and increased to 39.44 million copies in June. The distribution of books, newspapers, and periodicals is not only a newly developed business of the post office, but also has important significance in political education and cultural construction. The post office is striving to complete it as a political task, so the number of copies distributed will be strived to increase even more in the future. In terms of remittances, post offices throughout the country have basically been connected for remittances. In addition, certain achievements have been made in agency services such as selling People's Victory Inflation-Adjusted Bonds and selling stamp tax tickets.

    International postal services are developing today. In February of this year, China signed postal agreements with friendly nations, the Soviet Union and North Korea, based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. According to the Sino-Soviet postal agreement, all types of mail from China to Eastern European New Democratic countries can be forwarded via the Soviet Union. Not long ago, an agreement was reached with the Sino-Soviet Aviation Company to use the company's direct Sino-Soviet flights to carry airmail.

    In terms of telecommunications, there are currently 1,863 telecommunications bureaus across mainland China, an increase of 187% compared to 648 in June of last year. The vast majority of these were taken over with the expansion of newly liberated areas, and some were restored and established in the old liberated areas of North China and Northeast China. These bureaus are mainly distributed along transportation lines, in more important political, economic, and cultural towns, or in military and defense strongholds. The distribution area is largest in East China and smallest in Xinjiang.

    There are currently 2,027 wired telegraph circuits, 413 wireless telegraph circuits, 2,557 wired long-distance telephone circuits, and 102 wireless long-distance telephone circuits nationwide, with a total line length of approximately 110,000 pair-kilometers. There are over 230,000 local telephone lines nationwide, with a line length of approximately 240,000 pair-kilometers. The number of telephone lines actually installed decreased between March and April of this year due to price stability, the ban on speculative businesses, the change of professions in illegitimate industrial and commercial businesses, and the lack of unified organization telephone in major cities. However, many cities have gradually increased due to normal economic development, and this will inevitably be the trend across the country in the future.

    In terms of international communications, in addition to maintaining the original direct telegraph and telephone links between Shanghai and Moscow, Irkutsk, Almaty in the Soviet Union, Osaka in Japan, San Francisco in the United States, London in the United Kingdom, Paris in France, Rome in Italy, Geneva in Switzerland, Bombay in India, Sydney in Australia, Colombo in Ceylon, and Brazil, Peru, Argentina in South America, Belgium, Sweden, Norway in Europe, and the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand in Southeast Asia, telegraph and telephone circuits have also been established between Beijing and Moscow, wireless telephone and wireless facsimile circuits between Shanghai and Moscow, and wired telegraph circuits between Beijing and Vladivostok, as well as direct wireless telegraph and wired telephone circuits (Northeast China and North Korea) to the Czech Republic, North Korea, and Mongolia. In order to strengthen telecommunications links, telecommunications agreements have been signed with the Soviet Union and North Korea.

    According to the situation in the first half of this year, the production achievements of People's Posts and Telecommunications were 114.7% for postal services and 78.2% for telecommunications. During this period, there were many objective difficulties, and such achievements should mainly be attributed to the efforts of postal and telecommunications staff across the country.

    II. Several Issues in the Work

    The restoration and construction of People's Posts and Telecommunications is only just beginning at this stage. In order to more effectively promote the development of People's Posts and Telecommunications, the following issues related to postal and telecommunications work need to be addressed:

    1.  Postal and Telecommunications Rates: What principles should be adopted in determining postal and telecommunications rates is an important issue. Because the level of rates is directly related to the popularity of postal and telecommunications services among the people. At the same time, it is an important factor in determining whether postal and telecommunications services can be run as enterprises. The principles for determining postal and telecommunications rates should take into account the burden on postal and telecommunications users while also considering the long-term development of postal and telecommunications services; therefore, postal and telecommunications rates must be low while also covering costs. If an excessively low rate policy is adopted solely to take into account the burden on users, the operation of postal and telecommunications services will inevitably lead to increasing losses, and the result will be continuous reliance on the government to allocate subsidies from the taxes paid by the people; the vast majority of farmers in our country, who constitute the largest proportion of the population, currently use postal and telecommunications services very little or not at all. An excessively low rate policy is equivalent to mainly shifting the expenses that some postal and telecommunications users should bear to the vast number of farmers, and makes it difficult for postal and telecommunications services to develop, so that they cannot keep up with the needs of politics and the economy, which is inappropriate. Therefore, while taking into account the burden on users, users should also bear reasonable postal and telecommunications rates, thereby reducing government expenditures. However, postal and telecommunications services should also gradually move towards scientific management, reduce costs, and avoid a purely profit-oriented viewpoint in accordance with the principle of enterprise operation. Otherwise, it will similarly hinder the development of postal and telecommunications services. In the past, there were phenomena of excessively high postal and telecommunications rates or untimely adjustments in some areas. Regarding this point, the postal and telecommunications departments in charge have made necessary adjustments. For example, postal and telecommunications rates appeared too high after prices fell in April. After several studies and discussions, they were appropriately reduced. The postal service reduced the rates for registered, express, and double-registered letters from July 1st, and also halved the postage for local letters. In terms of telecommunications, the higher parts of telegram and telephone rates were also adjusted, and further adjustments are planned recently. At present, postal and telecommunications rates are generally calculated to be only about 70% of pre-war levels, which can fairly take into account the burden on users and is conducive to increasing the volume of postal and telecommunications business. Another issue with rates is the inconsistent requirements of military and government agencies regarding the use of postal and telecommunications services. According to statistics from June of this year, free official telegrams accounted for more than 20% of the total business volume nationwide, with telegram fees totaling 8.2 billion RMB; free long-distance telephone calls accounted for 21% of the total business volume nationwide. The increase in official telegrams and telephone calls has resulted in congested circuits, hindering the transmission time of other telegrams and telephone calls, and affecting postal and telecommunications business revenue; now, the General Administration of Long-Distance Telecommunications of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has formulated measures for the use of official telegrams and telephone calls, and issued them to local operational bureaus and relevant units for implementation in order to streamline the use of official telegrams and telephone calls. In the future, in order to improve the issue of the use of postal and telecommunications services by military and government agencies at all levels, it is best for the government to consider including postal and telecommunications expenses in the budget items of various agencies' regular expenses and pay fees in accordance with regulations. Only in this way can postal and telecommunications services be fundamentally helped to achieve enterprise management and strengthen the planning of postal and telecommunications use.

    2.  Expanding Service Coverage: Although the scope of postal and telecommunications services has been quite broad in the past, it mainly relied on large cities. Since the national liberation, this situation has not been fundamentally changed, especially in telecommunications. In addition to military and government agencies, the service targets mainly rely on urban industry and commerce, and the business volume often rises and falls with the prosperity and decline of urban commercial speculation. Since the nationwide financial and economic unification in March of this year, financial stability and prices have stabilized, and the telecommunications business volume has declined. From this, it can be seen that the development of postal and telecommunications services still lacks a broad mass base. In the future, in order to better serve the people in a planned way, in addition to consolidating and improving the existing foundation of urban postal and telecommunications services, it is necessary to continuously expand service coverage, requiring People's Posts and Telecommunications to penetrate towns and villages, and universally increase postal and telecommunications networks, which is very necessary. For example, an old woman in Ansai, northern Shaanxi, traveled a hundred li to write a letter to her son, and the local governments of Guangxi and Suiyuan, as well as the Baoding People's Congress, have all raised opinions that the establishment of post offices is not widespread enough. Although the number of postal routes has exceeded pre-war levels this year due to the large-scale adjustment of rural postal routes in old areas, the number of post offices and establishments is still much lower than before the war; as for the contact surface between telecommunications and the masses is even narrower, and it needs to be intensified and expanded. The expansion of service coverage must be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. First, attention must be paid to carrying out the necessary business promotion work to increase the masses' awareness of People's Posts and Telecommunications. For example, Panlong, northern Shaanxi, only received 100 letters in the past three months. After promotion, 100 letters were received in 20 days. At the same time, People's Posts and Telecommunications should get rid of the yamen style of work, and consider convenience for the people everywhere, such as organizing mobile service groups and sending work teams to the countryside. Secondly, the quality of services must be improved, launching a struggle to eliminate errors, eliminate the corruption and other bad practices that exist locally in postal and telecommunications services; use these practical actions to gain the trust of the people, and establish an important foundation for expanding service coverage and increasing production.

    3.  Completing Production Tasks: In the first half of this year, the production achievements of postal and telecommunications businesses, telecommunications has not yet completed the planned figures, while postal services have exceeded the plan by 14.7%. However, judging from the revenue and expenditure situation of postal and telecommunications in the first half of the year, revenue and expenditure are balanced, and there are surpluses on the books, so it can be said that there has been some success in business. However, this surplus is not an actual surplus and cannot be immediately regarded as the enterpriseization of postal and telecommunications operations. Because the surplus is mainly based on the fact that a considerable number of staff members are still paid on a supply system; and the depreciation of equipment and other items has not been included in the cost calculation. Therefore, if People's Posts and Telecommunications wants to achieve true enterprise operation, it still needs to make greater efforts on the existing basis. In the past six months, there have indeed been many difficulties in the objective conditions of production work; subjectively, there are also many shortcomings, the important thing is: the direction is not clear enough, the preparation for formulating production plans is not sufficient in advance, and the deployment is too late, resulting in the production plans of some local operational bureaus being divorced from reality, and there are also individual regions that do not pay enough attention to production plans and have not gone through mass discussions. In addition, a complete work inspection system has not yet been established. In the future, in order to complete the production tasks of People's Posts and Telecommunications, in addition to creating new conditions for business development as much as possible, a correct plan for completing the tasks must be formulated from bottom to top, the progress of production work should be focused, and attention should be paid to eliminating the various obstacles existing in the work, and regular inspections should be held to correct the deviations that occur in production work at any time. Completing the production tasks of postal and telecommunications is a struggle on the production front, and will constitute an important link in my country's economic construction. Postal and telecommunications workers across the country should provide a practical guarantee for this.

　　现阶段的邮电工作
    申光
    一、一般工作情况
    人民邮电是在人民解放战争中成长壮大起来的。由于解放战争在全国范围的胜利，邮电事业获得了空前迅速的发展。目前在国内外已恢复和建设起了广大的邮电网路。
    邮政方面，据统计，全国现共有邮局三六六二处，邮亭、邮务所、代办所、村镇信柜、邮站及邮票代售处等其他邮政机构共五○、○九七处，合计共有五三、七五九处，相当于一九三六年的百分之九三。分布情况则华东区较多，西北区最少。
    邮路总里程现在共长八七一、四二五公里，比一九三六年增加了百分之四九。其分布情形亦以华东为最多。如按类别统计：则航空占百分之○·九五，火车占二·六四，汽车占五·四五，水路占八·八九，旱班占八二·○七。邮路由邮局自办的约占总里程百分之七十八，其中利用人力的又占百分之九十六。汽车邮路共八、三八○公里，由兰州联络迪化、宁夏、包头、西宁、西安，再南至成都、重庆、贵阳，分别与滇越铁路的曲靖和黔桂铁路的都匀衔接，这些自办汽车邮路不仅负起了邮件运输的任务，对于西北西南的交通建设也有很大作用。最近更开辟了迪化至中苏边境的霍尔果斯邮车线，在沟通中苏两国邮运上，起了相当的作用。
    邮局业务的开展，据本年上半年的统计，全国各区共收寄函件三亿零三百八十万件，包件一百九十余万件。书报的发行业务，除华北东北和山东在一九四九年以前已有基础外，其余都是新近开办的。自本年三月一日起北京人民日报全部交邮局发行，国内很多报纸杂志也陆续交邮局发行，计今年报纸刊物的发行一月份为二、○八三万份，六月份已增加到三、九四四万份。书报刊物的发行，不仅是邮局的一种新发展的业务，而且由于它在政治教育文化建设上具有重要的意义，邮局是当作政治任务来努力完成的，因此今后发行份数将要争取更大量的扩增。汇兑方面，现在全国各地邮局基本上都已通汇，此外在代理业务方面如代销人民胜利折实公债、代售印花税票，均取得了一定成绩。
    国际邮务今天正在发展中，本年二月我国曾在平等互惠的原则下先后与友邦苏联及朝鲜签订了通邮协定。根据中苏通邮协定，我国寄东欧新民主主义国家各类邮件都可经由苏联转递，不久以前更与中苏航空公司洽定，利用该公司中苏直达航空机带运航空邮件。
    电信方面，目前全国大陆各地电信局所共一八六三处，较去年六月时的六四八处增加了百分之一百八十七，其中绝大部分系随新解放区扩大接管的，一部分是在华北东北老解放区恢复建立的，这些局所主要是分布于交通线，较重要的政治经济文化城镇或军事国防重地。分布的地区，以华东为最多，新疆最少。
    全国现有有线电报电路二○二七路，无线电报电路四一三路，有线长途电话电路二五五七路，无线长途电话电路一○二路，线路全长约十一万余对公里。市内电话全国共二十三万余门，线路约二十四万对公里。电话实装门数，今年三四月间，由于物价的稳定，投机事业的被取缔，不正当工商业的改行转业，以及各大城市内机关电话尚未统一，曾表现出降低的现象，其后不少城市已由于经济正常发展而逐渐增加，今后全国趋势亦必将如此。
    国际通讯方面，除保持原有的上海与苏联莫斯科、伊尔库次克、阿拉木图，日本的大阪，美国的旧金山，英国的伦敦，法国的巴黎，意大利的罗马，瑞士的日内瓦，印度的孟买，澳洲的雪黎，锡兰的科伦坡及南美洲的巴西、秘鲁、阿根廷，欧洲的比利时、瑞典、挪威，东南亚的菲律宾、越南、泰国等直达电报电话外，并先后建立了北京与莫斯科间的电报电话电路，上海与莫斯科间的无线电话与无线电传真电路，北京与海参崴间的有线电报电路，至捷克、朝鲜、蒙古等无线电报有线电话（东北与朝鲜）直达电路。为了加强电信联系并与苏联及朝鲜签订了中苏、中朝通电协定。
    人民邮电事业的生产成绩，按今年上半年的情况言，邮政完成了百分之一一四·七，电信完成了百分之七八·二。这个期间客观条件尚多困难，获得这样的成绩，主要应归功于全国邮电工作人员的努力。
    二、工作中的几个问题
    人民邮电事业的恢复和建设，现阶段还仅在开始，为了更有效地促进人民邮电事业的发展，下面有关邮电工作的几个问题，有提出申述的必要：
    一、邮电资费问题：邮电资费的决定应采取怎样的原则，是一个重要问题。因为资费的高低与人民大众使用邮电之普及与否有直接关系。同时又是决定邮电事业能否企业化的重要因素。决定邮电资费的原则，应当考虑邮电使用者的负担同时并照顾邮电事业的长远发展；因此必须使邮电资费低廉而能兼顾成本。如果单纯为了照顾使用者负担而采取过低的资费政策，邮电事业的经营必致日益亏损，其结果要不断的仰赖政府从人民所纳的税款中拨出贴补；我国占人口最大多数的农民目前是很少或根本不使用邮电的，过低的资费政策等于将部分使用邮电者的应纳费用主要转嫁到广大农民身上，并使邮电事业难于发展，以致配合不上政治、经济的需要，这是不恰当的。因此在照顾使用者的负担之中，同时亦应该由使用者来负担合理的邮电资费，借以节减政府的开支。但，邮电事业亦应当依照企业化经营的原则逐渐走向科学管理、降低成本避免单纯的赢利观点，把资费订得过高的偏向；否则同样地会妨碍了邮电业务的发展。过去邮电资费曾局部存在过偏高或调整不及时的现象。关于这一点，邮电负责部门已作必要的调整，例如邮电资费在四月物价下降后曾显得太高，经过几次研究和讨论，已予适当降低，邮政于七月一日起将挂号、挂快、双挂号信的资费减低，同时又把本埠信邮资减低了一半。电信方面电报、电话资费较高部分也予以调整，最近并拟继续调整。目前邮电资费一般计算仅约为战前百分之七十，已能相当照顾使用者的负担，并有利于邮电业务之量的增进。资费的另一个问题是军政机关在使用邮电上对邮电事业的某些不相一致的要求。根据本年六月份统计，全国免费公务电报占业务总量百分之二十强，报费共达人民币八十二亿元；全国长途电话免费则占业务总量百分之二十一。公务报话增加的结果，造成了电路拥挤，妨碍其他报话传递时间，影响邮电业务收入；现在，邮电部长途电信总局在这方面已定出公务报话使用办法，通令各地现业局及有关单位执行，以求公务报话的精简。今后为改善关于各级军政机关的使用邮电问题，最好由政府考虑在各机关经常费内列入邮电费预算科目，照章纳费，这样才能从根本上帮助邮电事业达到企业经营和加强邮电使用的计划性。
    二、扩大服务面问题：过去邮电事业的业务面虽已相当宽广，但主要是依靠大城市。全国解放以来，基本上还不能改变这一情况，特别是电信，服务对象除军政机关外，主要依靠城市的工商业，业务量往往随城市商业投机的盛衰而升降。自本年三月全国财经统一后，金融物价全面稳定，电信业务量即呈下降，由此可知邮电事业的发展还缺乏着广大群众基础。今后要做到有计划的更好的为人民服务，除了巩固和健全城市邮电事业已有基础外，应该不断扩展服务面，要求人民邮电事业深入市镇、深入农村，普遍增设邮电网路，这是非常必要的。例如陕北安塞一位老太太为了给儿子写信，跑了一百里地，广西、绥远的当地政府以及保定人民代表大会都曾提出邮局设置不够普遍的意见。本年在邮路上虽因老区大量调整乡邮路线而超过战前；邮政局所数目与战前相较则还相差很多；至于电信与群众的接触面更窄，需要加紧予以扩大，扩展服务面须有计划有步骤的进行，首先要注意展开必要的业务宣传工作，提高群众对人民邮电事业的认识，例如陕北蟠龙过去三个月只收信一百封，经宣传后，二十天即收信一百封。同时，人民邮电事业应摆脱衙门作风，处处为人民便利设想，如组织流动服务组、下乡工作队等。其次，业务质量必须提高，展开消灭差错的斗争，消灭邮电事业中局部存在的贪污腐化现象和其他不良作风；以这些实际行动来获取人民的信任，树立开拓服务面和增加生产的重要基础。
    三、完成生产任务问题：本年上半年邮电业务的生产成绩，电信还没有完成计划数字，邮政则超过计划百分之一四·七，而就上半年邮政电信收支情况来看，收支相抵，帐面上均有存余，所以在业务上可以说是有一定成绩的。但此项存余并非实际的盈余，不能即以为邮电的经营已经企业化。因为存余之产生，主要是建立在相当多数工作人员的待遇仍采供给制；与器材设备等的折旧还没有列入成本内计算。所以人民邮电事业如要达到真正的企业化经营，还需要在现有基础上作更大的努力。过去半年来的生产工作，客观条件确有许多困难；主观方面，也有不少缺点，重要的是：方针不够明确，制订生产计划事先准备不够，布置太迟，致有些地方现业局的生产计划脱离实际，还有个别地区对生产计划不够重视，没有经过群众性的讨论。此外，完备的工作检查制度还没有建立起来。今后为了完成人民邮电事业的生产任务，除了尽量创造业务发展上新的条件外，必须自下而上的订出一套正确的完成任务的计划，生产工作的进行应有重点，并注意消除工作中存在的各种障碍，同时举行经常检查，随时改正生产工作中发生的偏向。完成邮电的生产任务，是生产战线上的一个斗争，将构成我国经济建设中重要的一环，全国邮电职工应该为此提供切实的保证。
