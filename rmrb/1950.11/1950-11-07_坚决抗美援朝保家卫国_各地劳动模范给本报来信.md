　　Resolutely Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation
    Letters to This Newspaper from Labor Models Across the Country
    Support Korea to Defeat American Imperialism
    Strive for Lasting World Peace

    Editor Comrade:
    When we heard the news that American invading planes had again violated our airspace, all the staff and workers were unanimously furious and expressed their attitude: do a good job in our production tasks in practical work and be the vanguard force supporting the front line.
    American imperialism strafed and bombed our Northeast people, threatening the safety of our people and destroying the happy lives of our people. This is clearly expanding the war of aggression against our country and disrupting world peace. We can no longer tolerate this kind of aggression. We peace-loving people must unite and resolutely smash it!
    In order to defend the security of our motherland, I resolutely support and support Premier Zhou's accusations to the United Nations. The workers in our flour mill have all made plans to increase production based on their own work. We must further strengthen factory security work to strictly prevent sabotage and rumors by special agents. We must fully support the Korean people in defeating American imperialist aggression and striving for lasting world peace.

    American Imperialism is Like Vermin in a Granary
    We can definitely extinguish it

    Editor Comrade:
    While American imperialism was carrying out armed aggression against Korea, it also invaded our Taiwan and openly and continuously sent military aircraft to invade our Northeast and coastal areas of Shandong, bombing, strafing and killing our compatriots. These bloody crimes demonstrate its beastly madness and dying struggle, and will inevitably suffer the same fate as Hitler. I think American imperialism is like the rampant breeding of warehouse pests, and after everyone's concerted efforts, they can eventually be wiped out.

    Our Anti-Aggression Blood is Boiling
    We will never let American Imperialism continue to make trouble

    Editor Comrade:
    American imperialism, under the guise of the United Nations, launched a war of aggression in Korea, cruelly slaughtering and indiscriminately bombing the peace-loving residents of our friendly neighboring country, Korea, and further sending planes to repeatedly invade our territorial waters and airspace, strafing our Northeast compatriots, and recently, ignoring the warnings of our people, frantically expanding the flames of the war of aggression to our Northeast border, threatening our national security. We can no longer tolerate this series of provocative actions. We Chinese people love peace, but we are not afraid of war. We must resolutely support the Korean people's just war of national defense. We must take action on the production front, work a hundred times harder, complete our tasks ahead of schedule, develop the economy, and actively strengthen national defense. If American imperialism dares to extend its claws to invade us, we will chop off its claws. At the same time, we must be more vigilant, smash the enemy's conspiracies, and suppress counter-revolutionary elements. We have the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the heroic and invincible People's Liberation Army, and the united and consistent broad working people. We absolutely have the confidence to eliminate American aggression and defend world peace.
    In the past few days, all the comrades in our Agricultural Water Conservancy Bureau have been enthusiastically discussing current affairs and have the above unanimous views. The comrades' blood is already boiling. If American imperialism does not turn back and repent according to the just demands put forward by Premier Zhou to the United Nations, we will not let it continue to make trouble.

    Where American Devils Invade
    That is Their Grave

    Editor Comrade:
    The shameless crimes of American imperialism in launching a war of aggression have aroused great indignation among the people of our entire county. Currently, the folks in each village are preparing how to oppose the American imperialist war of aggression. The labor model representatives of our entire county propose: we must make the large-scale production of the entire county a vigorous success and launch a broad production competition movement. The folks say: "Not only must we do a good job in production, but we must also quickly hand in this year's autumn grain and ensure that we hand in good grain and good cotton, strengthen the country's economic strength, and better help the Korean People's Army stop the American imperialist aggression." Jiao Luozhuan, a 64-year-old worker on the brick kiln I lead, also expressed great hatred for the atrocities of American imperialism. He said: "Not only must I do a good job in making bricks, but I must immediately write to my son and let him work harder and learn more tactics in the army to prepare to help the Korean People's Army fight the American devils." Other workers have also expressed: "We must not let the American devils continue to run rampant. In addition, the workers on the pottery kiln I lead also said: "We absolutely cannot tolerate the American devils launching a war. We guarantee that the pots will be made well and that the production plan will be completed even faster."
    In short, the labor model representatives of each village in our entire county and the folks of the entire county all realize that: "Although the American devils are rampant, they will eventually end up like the Japanese devils. Wherever they invade, that is their grave. If the American devils dare to burn the flames of war to our territory, they will definitely be destroyed in the flames of the Chinese people's war of resistance against aggression."

　　坚决抗美援朝保家卫国
    各地劳动模范给本报来信
    支援朝鲜打败美帝
    争取世界持久和平编辑同志：
    当我们听到侵朝美机有再度犯我领空消息后，全体职工一致愤怒，并表示了态度：在实际工作中搞好我们的生产任务，做好支援前线的生力军。
    美帝扫射和轰炸我东北人民，威胁我国人民的安全，破坏我人民的美满生活，这显然是向我国扩大侵略战争，捣乱世界和平。他的这种侵略，我们再也忍不住了，我们爱好和平的人们都要团结起来，坚决粉碎它！
    为了保卫我们祖国的安全，我坚决拥护和支援周总理向联合国提出的控诉。我们面粉厂的工友们，都根据自己的工作，订出了提高生产的计划。我们更要进一步加强工厂保卫工作，严防特务破坏和造谣。我们要全力支援朝鲜人民，以打败美帝侵略，争取世界的持久和平。
          工业劳模  刘鸿庆
    美帝像粮仓里的害虫
    我们一定可以扑灭它编辑同志：
    美帝在武装侵略朝鲜同时，侵略了我台湾，并公开以军用飞机连续侵入我东北及山东沿海一带，轰炸扫射杀害我国同胞，这些血腥罪行，正说明它兽性的疯狂和垂死的挣扎，同时也必将遭受与希特勒同样的下场。我认为美帝也好像仓库害虫的繁殖猖獗一样，经过大家一致的努力，终可把它们扑灭。
                工业劳模  于菊生
    我们反侵略的热血沸腾了
    决不让美帝继续作乱下去编辑同志：
    美帝盗用联合国名义，在朝鲜发动侵略战争，残酷地屠杀滥炸我友邻国家——朝鲜爱好和平的居民，并进一步地派飞机屡次侵犯我领海、领空，扫射我东北同胞，最近又不顾我国人民的警告，疯狂地把侵略战争的火焰扩大到我东北边境，威胁我国安全。这一连串的挑衅行为，使我们不能再事容忍。我中国人民爱好和平，但也不害怕战争，我们要坚决地支援朝鲜人民正义的卫国战争，我们要在生产战线上行动起来，百倍努力工作，提前完成任务，发展经济，积极加强国防，如果美帝敢于伸出魔爪侵犯我们的时候，我们就把它的魔爪砍掉。同时我们更要提高警惕，粉碎敌人的阴谋活动，镇压反革命分子。我们有毛主席和共产党的正确领导，有英勇不可战胜的解放军，有团结一致的广大劳动人民，我们绝对有信心消灭美国侵略势力，保卫世界和平。
    最近几天内，我们农田水利局的全体同志，都在热烈地讨论时事，都有以上的一致见解。同志们的热血已在沸腾了，若美帝死不回头，不按周总理向联合国所提出的正义要求去改过自新，我们是不会让他继续作乱的。

    美国鬼子侵犯到那里
    那里就是他们的坟墓编辑同志：
    美帝发动侵略战争的无耻罪行，已激起了我全县人民的极大愤恨。现各村老乡们正在准备如何反对美帝的侵略战争，我全县劳模代表同志们提出：我们要将全县的大生产搞的轰轰烈烈，展开一个广泛的生产竞赛运动。老乡们说：“不但把生产工作搞好，并且要将今年的秋征公粮很快的缴上，保证缴好粮好棉，加强国家经济力量，更好地帮助朝鲜人民军制止美帝侵略暴行。”我领导的砖窑上六十四岁的工人焦洛砖对美帝的暴行也同样表示极大的仇恨。他说：“我不但要将砖搞好，并要立即给我的儿子去信，让他在部队中多加油、多学战术，准备去帮助朝鲜人民军打美国鬼子。”其他别的工人们也都纷纷表示：“决不能让美国鬼子们再横行霸道下去。另外，我领导的盆窑上的工人们也都说：“咱们是绝不能容忍美国鬼子发动战争的。咱们保证将盆做的好好的，保证生产计划更能很快的完成。”
    总之，我全县各村劳模代表同志们及全县的老乡们都认识到：“美国鬼子虽然横行霸道，但早晚也得落个日本鬼子的下场。他们要侵犯到那里，那里就是他们的坟墓，假设美国鬼子胆敢把战火烧向我们的国土，他们就一定要在我国人民反抗侵略战争的火焰中毁灭。
