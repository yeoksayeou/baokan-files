What Should We Do?
    Rao Yutai, Professor at Peking University

    Defending peace and resisting aggression are inseparable. This is a very simple truth, and there is no need to say more. The question now is: in this great era of defending peace and resisting aggression, what should we, as scientific workers, do, since we are not as good at farming as old farmers, and not as good at wielding guns as the villagers? What can we do? Naturally, while time still allows us to teach, we should teach well; while time still allows us to do research, we should do research well. But, when the situation no longer allows us to do so, what should we do?

    I suggest:
    (1) Concentrate the nation's mathematics, physics, and electrical engineering workers to specialize in radar research, construction, and practical application.
    (2) Concentrate the nation's chemistry and chemical engineering workers to specialize in the research and industrial practical application of coal gasification and synthetic rubber.
    (3) Concentrate the nation's biochemistry, physiology, and biology workers to specialize in the research and practical application of medicine and nutritious substitutes.

    Other disciplines should have similar organizations for concentrated research. The above are just examples.

    If we mobilize and organize now, even if we cannot achieve anything, at least we can know where the problems lie, at least we will know how much we don't know. For one must first experience something to understand its difficulty, and one must first do something to understand its complexity. This may be a small contribution from us, the scientific workers, to this era.

　　我们应该做什么？
    北大教授  饶毓泰
    保卫和平与抵抗侵略是分不开的。这是极平凡的道理，用不着多说。现在的问题是：在这个保卫和平，抵抗侵略的大时代里，我们作为科学工作者，学稼不如老圃，拿枪不如老乡，应该做些什么？可能做些什么？自然，当着时间还容许我们教书，我们应该好好教书，时间还容许我们研究，我们应该好好研究。但是，到了局势不容许我们这样做的时候，我们怎么做？
    我建议：
    （一）集中全国数学、物理、电机工程工作者专作雷达研究、构造和实际应用。
    （二）集中全国化学和化学工程工作者专作气化煤和综合胶的研究和工业上的实际应用。
    （三）集中全国生化，生理和生物工作者专作医药及滋养代替品的研究与实际应用。
    其他学科要有类似的组织，作集中的研究，以上不过举例而已。
    假如我们现在就动员起来，组织起来，虽不能有所成就，至少可以知道问题所在，至少知道我们不知道的有多少。盖必履之而后艰，为之而后难也。这可能将是我们科学工作者对于这个时代的些微贡献。
