　　Japan Federation of Industrial Unions Holds Executive Committee Meeting
　　Resolves to Struggle Against Division, Against Oppression, and Against War Preparations.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch] According to a United Press report: The All-Japan Federation of Industrial Unions (Sanbetsu) convened its 13th Executive Committee meeting on October 10th. The conference passed a resolution stating: Sanbetsu's current urgent task is to prevent chaos in the battlefront and organize unified action after the dissolution of the All-Japan Federation of Trade Union Liaison Council. We must not only struggle against the oppression of domestic and foreign monopoly capital, but also resolutely fight against plots to create division from within, in order to safeguard the freedom of trade union activities. Standing on the position of defending workers' lives, we will struggle against war preparations and colonial rule.
    The resolution pointed out: Reactionaries have begun to undermine trade union work under the pretext of "purging Reds," implementing mass layoffs, reducing wages, and turning workplaces into prisons. In response to these reactionary measures, the resolution calls on all trade unions and members to fully participate in the current struggle, stand at the forefront, and strive to establish broad common struggle organizations and defend the basic rights and interests of workers.
    The conference also resolved to postpone the Sanbetsu's 6th Plenary Session, originally scheduled to be held in November of this year, to the spring of next year.

　　日产联举行执委会
　　决议为反对分裂、反对压迫、反对战争准备而斗争。
    【新华社七日讯】据联合通讯社讯：全日产业别工会联合会（产联）在十月十日召开了第十三次执行委员会。大会作出决议称：产联当前的紧急任务是在全日工会联络协议会被解散后，使战线不发生混乱，组织一致的行动。我们不仅要对国内外垄断资本的压迫进行斗争，并且也要对企图自内部进行分裂的策动进行坚决的斗争，以保卫工会组织活动的自由。站在保卫工人生活的立场，与战争准备及殖民地统治进行斗争。
    决议指出：反动派已开始假借“整赤化分子”的名义，进行破坏工会的工作，并实行大批解雇、减低工资、使工作场所监狱化。针对这些反动措施，决议号召各工会及会员全力参加当前的斗争，站在最前线，为确立广泛的共同斗争组织及保卫工人的基本权利与利益而奋斗。
    大会并决议将原订在今年十一月召开的产联第六次全体大会，延期至明年春天举行。
