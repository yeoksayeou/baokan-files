　　US Troop Shortage
    The Korean War Has Sharply Exposed This Major Weakness in the US Military
    [Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch] The Korean War has sharply exposed a major weakness in the US military: its troop shortage is severely disproportionate to the vast scope of intervention it has assigned itself. According to the US ruling group's magazine, "U.S. News & World Report," in its July 21st issue, at the start of the Korean War, the US had a total of only ten combat-ready divisions, totaling 150,000 men. However, these troops were distributed across regions stretching from the US mainland, Alaska, Japan, and Okinawa to West Germany, spanning three continents and two oceans, separated by distances of tens of thousands of miles.
    After launching the Korean War, the US discovered that its plan to rapidly sweep across North Korea had failed. Therefore, it hurriedly transferred all available combat forces from Japan, the Pacific, and its own country, sending them urgently to the Korean battlefield, concentrating sixty percent of its total combat divisions on the small Korean peninsula.
    As a result, the US was even more stretched thin in terms of manpower. According to the aforementioned American magazine, the US had approximately 160,000 troops stationed in Europe, but only one combat division. Western European satellite states felt that with such a small US force attempting to attack the Soviet Union, they would be the first to face misfortune, and repeatedly pleaded with the US to increase its troop presence. Truman was then forced to issue an empty order, stating that he would "substantially" increase troops in Western Europe. However, despite the order, the troops were stuck in Korea and could not be extracted, and even those troops themselves felt that the "situation was serious."
    The White House had a wishful plan to have European satellite states provide manpower while it supplied weapons, forming a "European army" for it to command. Although the traitorous governments of Western European countries, under the coercion and temptation of money, agreed to play this shameful role of running dogs, they could not provide much help in terms of actual strength. France, the main provider of ground forces, demanded three billion US dollars from the US, but only promised to establish twenty-five divisions within three years.
    Therefore, Wall Street decided to utilize the reactionary forces of West Germany with its militaristic traditions as soon as possible, a scheme that was immediately cheered by the fascist forces in West Germany. However, the US, British, and French foreign ministers' meeting in New York and the Atlantic Council meeting, while advancing the war plan, found that this issue involved many complications. First, the people of the world struggling for peace would not allow it. Second, the people of Western Europe who had suffered under the oppression of Hitler's army strongly opposed it. Finally, the youth of West Germany had repeatedly expressed their unwillingness to serve as cannon fodder for US imperialism. As a result, the meeting communiqué had to carefully obscure its language on this point. Until now, the question of what formation to use to restore the German army has not been finally resolved.
    The American rulers, in pursuit of world hegemony, have also encountered various forms of resistance and difficulties in their own country. Only one-fifth of eligible young men pass the physical examination on average, and many conscripted youths simply refuse to report, forcing the government to take legal measures. After conscription began, the number of young Americans getting married suddenly increased, because according to current US regulations, married men can be deferred. One veteran, after receiving a conscription notice, damaged his right hand and told others that they could no longer force him to join the army.
    In the US, where life is difficult, the ruling group feels that it can induce young people to sell their lives by increasing soldiers' pay by a few dollars, or even with "cheap goods" in military commissaries and "disability benefits." However, "U.S. News & World Report" revealed a secret, that after the conscription order was issued, there were slightly more "voluntary" enlistments, because if it was "voluntary," one could choose the nature of service and stay farther away from danger.
    According to the current conscription law, the US has only 1.5 million registered and eligible young men. Even if all of them are conscripted and fully incorporated into the army, based on the current ratio of combat personnel to non-combat personnel in the US Army (one to three), it could only assemble less than 400,000 combat troops. Newly conscripted recruits also need one year to complete their training.
    The Truman government's plan is to expand the armed forces to three million by the middle of next year, with the army accounting for about half. Even if all are counted as combat personnel, it would only be three-quarters of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops annihilated by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the past year.
    This matter is causing Washington a great headache.

### 美国兵源困难  朝鲜战争已尖锐地暴露了美国军事上这个重大弱点

　　美国兵源困难
    朝鲜战争已尖锐地暴露了美国军事上这个重大弱点
    【新华社十日讯】朝鲜战争尖锐地暴露了美国军事上的一个重大弱点，就是它的兵员困难，与它给自己安排的辽阔范围内的干涉任务，极不相称。据美国统治集团的杂志“美国新闻与世界报道”七月二十一日出版的一期曾经透露，在朝鲜战争开始时，美国总共只有十个可以打仗的师，十五万人。而军队分布的地区却从美国本部、阿拉斯加、日本、冲绳直到西德，跨三大洲，两大洋，相互远隔以万里计的距离。
    美国在发动朝鲜战争之后，发觉迅速席卷北朝鲜的算盘是落空了，于是就匆忙地从日本、太平洋及本国调遣一切可以调动的战斗兵力，紧急送往朝鲜战场，把它全部作战师团的百分之六十集中在小小的朝鲜半岛上。
    结果，美国在兵员上已更加捉襟见肘。据上面那个美国杂志说，美国在欧洲共驻扎有约十六万军队，却只有一个作战师。西欧仆从国家对于美国只有那样一点军队却要想去进攻苏联，深感反而会首先替他们招来厄运，因此再三恳求美国增兵。杜鲁门于是不得不发布一道空头命令，说要“着实”增兵西欧。但命令虽下，军队却陷在朝鲜拔不出来，而且连那些军队本身，还感到“形势严重”。
    白宫的一个如意算盘是让欧洲仆从国家来提供人力，而由它供给武器，组成一支供它驱使的“欧洲军队”。西欧国家的卖国政府虽然在金元的威迫与诱惑之下，同意担任这个可耻的走卒角色，却并不能够在实力上给出多少帮忙。作为陆军主要提供者的法国，要美国三十亿美元，却只约许在三年内成立二十五个师。
    因此，华尔街决定还是及早起用具有军国主义传统的西德的反动力量，这个意图立即受到西德法西斯势力的欢呼。但是美、英、法纽约外长会议和大西洋公约理事会会议，在推进战争计划同时，发现这个问题牵连还很多，首先是世界为和平而斗争的人民不允许，其次是遭受过希特勒军队压迫的西欧人民也强烈反对，最后，西德的青年已经反复表示他们不愿意为美国帝国主义充当炮灰。结果，会议公报关于这点就不得不苦心地隐晦其词。直到现在，关于用什么编制来恢复德国陆军的问题，仍未最后解决。
    追求世界霸权的美国统治者，在本国也遇着各色各样的反抗和困难。适龄壮丁平均只有五分之一检查合格，许多被召的青年干脆拒不报到，迫使政府不得不采取法律手段。在征兵开始后，美国年青人结婚的数目，突然增加，因为按照美国现行的规定，有家庭的男子可以缓征。有一个退伍军官在得到征召令后毁坏了自己的右手，并且告诉别人说，人家现在再不能要他去当兵了。
    在生活困难的美国，统治集团觉得可以用提高士兵几块钱饷银、甚至以军事贩卖部有“廉价商品”和“残废津贴”之类来诱使青年卖命。但是“美国新闻与世界报道”道破了一项秘密，即征兵令发表后，“志愿”报名的反而多了一点，因为如果是“自愿”的，还可以对服役性质有所选择，离得危险远一点。
    按现行征兵法，美国已登记及龄并合格的壮丁只有一百五十万，即使全部征召起来，完全编入陆军，按现在美国陆军中战斗人员与非战斗人员一与三之比，也只能凑成不到四十万作战部队。新征召的新兵，还需有一年的时间来完成他们的训练。
    杜鲁门政府的计划是到明年年中，把武装部队扩大到三百万，其中陆军约占一半。即使全部算作战斗人员，也不过中国人民解放军过去一年中间所歼灭的蒋匪军的四分之三。
    这件事情使华盛顿极为头痛。
