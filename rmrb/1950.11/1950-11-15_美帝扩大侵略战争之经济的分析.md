	First, on the economic driving force of US imperialism's expansion of aggressive war

Why is US imperialism so frantically expanding its aggressive war? Economically speaking, it has grown fat by drinking the blood of war for the past thirty years. Currently, against the backdrop of an unprecedentedly severe overall crisis of world capitalism, due to the extremely sharp fundamental contradiction between productive forces and production relations, it has reached a dead end economically and is facing a destructive economic crisis. This is pushing it to carry out military adventures, from frantically preparing for war to openly launching the war of aggression against Korea, and further from launching war to expanding war, seriously threatening our country's security and world peace.

Here, let's briefly trace the war-profiteering history of US imperialism over the past thirty years. When World War I broke out in the autumn of 1914, the United States was in an economic recession. It was only because of the war that it overcame that period of depression and began to enter a period of active production and industrial development. This "war prosperity" caused by the torrent of military orders not only continued throughout the four years of World War I, but also – except for the small crisis in 1920-21 – ran through the entire decade after 1920. That is to say, from the end of the Great War in 1918 until the outbreak of the Great Crisis in October 1929, the reconstruction of the war-torn European countries led to large exports of American goods, which formed the basis of this decade of "prosperity." Therefore, during World War I and the ten years thereafter, US capitalism drank its fill of the blood of war and grew stronger day by day. But when the post-war reconstruction ended, the unprecedentedly severe economic crisis of overproduction broke out in the autumn of 1929. In the United States alone, there were once 17 million unemployed workers. It can be seen that without the "crutch" of war, the contradiction between the unprecedented increase in American productivity and the unprecedented reduction (both relatively and absolutely) in the people's consumption power suddenly erupted. In the decade after 1930, the US economy suffered from anemia, with only two-thirds of its production capacity in operation, and the number of unemployed never fell below 10 million.

It was only when World War II broke out in Europe in 1939 that American industry once again received nourishment from a steady stream of military orders and showed vitality. During World War II, the US economy was "prosperous" as never before. According to materials in "Economic Crisis and Cold War" co-authored by Foster and Allen, from 1940 to 1944, industrial production increased by 116 percent; industrial production capacity increased by about 40 percent; the utilization rate of industrial production capacity increased by about one-third (but even at the peak of war production, it was not fully utilized, for example, about 15 percent of production capacity was not utilized in 1944); trade exports increased from $3.2 billion in 1939 to $14.3 billion in 1944; (it fell back to $9.8 billion as soon as the war stopped in 1945) the number of unemployed decreased from nearly 10 million in 1939 to 700,000 in 1944; in the four years of the war, various monopoly groups obtained a total of more than $87 billion in profits (increasing from $6.4 billion in 1939 to $24.5 billion in 1943), while the basic wage rate of workers only increased by 22 percent from 1939 to 1944, and the productivity of workers increased by 25 percent. In short, US capitalism once again had a "golden dream," and the monopoly capitalists once again went to "heaven."

However, the rapid growth of wartime productivity made the fundamental contradiction of post-war US capitalism – the contradiction between productive forces and production relations, manifested as the contradiction between productive forces and consumption power or purchasing power – even more serious. Once the morphine injection of war was stopped, the American productive forces caused the "stomach" of American capitalist society to swell to the point of death. The false "prosperity" of the past few years passed in a blink of an eye, and then the pains began to occur, and it looked as if it was about to produce a "monster" that would ravage the entire capitalist world – an economic crisis even more serious than the one in 1929. In fact, the United States began a new crisis of overproduction in the autumn of 1948. For example, from November 1948 to July 1949, industrial production fell by 15 percent; the number of fully unemployed increased from 1.6 million in October 1948 to about 5 million in April 1949. US imperialists were deeply afraid that once this crisis fully unfolded, it would fundamentally subvert the entire capitalist world, and the monopoly capitalists would also fall from their bloody "heaven" to the 18th level of hell. What to do? In their view, the basic problem was how to "fill" the huge gap between the overdeveloped productive forces and the declining purchasing power of the United States and other countries. They advocated using a huge war economy system to "fill in the gaps" between production and consumption, using tens of billions or hundreds of billions of US dollars in military orders each year to feed American industry. The monopoly capitalists believed that war orders and war itself were necessary to maintain industry. In other words, the US wartime economy simply cannot be restored to a peacetime economy, and the peacetime economy is simply indistinguishable from the wartime economy. From then on, there was no strict boundary between the peacetime economy and the wartime economy. From then on, US capitalism could no longer be separated from the "crutch" of war. It was precisely because of this that as soon as World War II stopped, the Truman government began a new round of frantic arms build-up. After the war, the so-called "managed economy" of US imperialism was actually a kind of war economy. Foster put it well: "Truman's 'managed economy' is a policy of militarism, imperialism, and war" (Economic Crisis and Cold War, original text, page 7); "The worse the economic situation, the greater the crisis of war" (ibid., page 5). Economic motivation and the political and military ambition to conquer the world combined, finally pushing US imperialists from preparing for war to launching war, and further from launching war to expanding war. Thus, the American big bourgeoisie is once again taking the "blood transport." Originally, in the past few years after the war, mainly due to the Truman government's active arms build-up policy and the frantic external aggression after the war, such as the Marshall Plan, coupled with the United States' abolition of price controls, along with other factors that temporarily came into play, the American big monopoly capitalists had already obtained even more profits than during the war. For example, 12.5 billion in 1946, 17.4 billion in 1947, 24.6 billion in 1948, and approximately 26.5 billion in 1949. According to Truman's estimate, it may reach 30 billion to 30.5 billion in 1950. After the launch of the war of aggression against Korea, the US government immediately added more than 30 billion US dollars to the military budget, of which more than 17 billion was used to purchase "goods," and the vast majority was to purchase "hard goods," that is, airplanes, cannons, tanks, and so on. In this way, the blood and sweat money of the people of the United States and its vassal states flowed through the hands of the Truman government and poured into the pockets of the arms dealers; the blood of the people of the United States and its vassal states once again built the "golden mountains" of the American big bourgeoisie.

The American big bourgeoisie believes that war is their "way out" and their "lifesaver." Is this really the case? In fact, it is completely the opposite. For the entire capitalist system, war is by no means a lifesaver, but precisely the "death knell" of imperialism. World War I defeated capitalism in one-sixth of the world's territory, giving rise to the first socialist country, the Soviet Union, and plunging capitalism into an irretrievable general crisis; after World War II, half of the rivers and mountains of Eastern and Southeastern Europe broke away from capitalist rule, giving rise to a group of new democratic countries, plus the German Democratic Republic. In the East, the Chinese revolution succeeded, 475 million people smashed the shackles of imperialism, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam were also established successively, and the flames of national liberation struggles were also ignited in other colonial and semi-colonial countries. In short, the overall crisis of capitalism is doubly serious. If the imperialist camp headed by the United States dares to launch a third world war, the result will inevitably be the final destruction of the entire capitalist system.

In the past, Japanese imperialism and German imperialism both grew up from war, and finally collapsed in war; similarly, US imperialism, which made its fortune from war, is bound to die in war today. This is precisely what is called "playing with fire and burning oneself."

	Second, on the productive forces of the United States and the war of aggression

Although the production capacity of US imperialism is not small, production capacity itself is not equal to war power, and it must be closely combined with sufficient manpower and other conditions to play its role. The purely productive force viewpoint of war, that is, a variant of the theory of weapons as the sole determinant, is mechanical, one-sided, and unrealistic. Stalin once said that the guarantee of victory is high morale (which is related to the nature of the war), a consolidated rear (imperialism cannot have a consolidated rear), the economic power of the country (although the productive forces of US imperialism are not small, its power is not great due to the lack of coordination with other conditions), a large number of excellent divisions (this is one of the fatal weaknesses of US imperialism), and so on. Marxist-Leninist military science never isolates the role of man from the role of things; the metaphysical viewpoint of bourgeois military scholars often exaggerates the role of things and obliterates the role of man. Even some American military commentators themselves, such as Max Werner, do not agree with this. He once said: "In recent years, the standards used by our political and military leaders to measure military strength are money, appropriations, production volume, and the amount of atomic bombs in storage. This is not the concept of military planners, but the concept of engineers and business managers. This concept separates the industrial base of war from organized combat forces"; "Production volume alone cannot win a battle, this is completely forgotten"; "The total military power of a country must not exceed its actual combat power. If there are not enough soldiers and combat units to use the available military weapons and machinery, then the unused mechanical equipment must be written off as military surplus"; "All demands for large-scale production mobilization and increased war production cannot change this major defect in the US and Western European military institutions: a lack of trained and organized combat forces... The ground weapons mass-produced by the US and Western European war industries are threatened by a kind of strategic unemployment."

However, the problem does not stop there. When talking about productive forces, one cannot ignore production relations, that is, the social economic system; it is one-sided, wrong, and harmful to look at productive forces in isolation from production relations. The role of productive forces in war must be viewed in conjunction with production relations, which is correct and reasonable. Productive forces and production relations together constitute a country's mode of production and also constitute a country's economic power. For example, we can compare the wartime economies of the United States and the Soviet Union during World War II. Voznesensky had a very scientific analysis of this in his authoritative work "The Soviet Wartime Economy during the Great Patriotic War." He said: "The Soviet wartime economy... is fundamentally different from the wartime economies of capitalist countries. This difference can be seen from the comparison between the foundation of the Soviet wartime economy and the foundation of the US wartime economy, for example.

"First, the Soviet wartime economy is based on a socialist economy built on the public ownership of the means of production, while the US wartime economy is a capitalist economy that has developed to the stage of domination by capitalist monopoly organizations and financial capital. During World War II, the rule of American capitalist monopoly organizations was fiercely strengthened on the basis of further aggregation and concentration of capital... It suffices to point out that in 1944, 75 percent of all US military orders were taken by 100 large capitalist monopoly organizations, of which 30 extremely large monopoly capitalists took 49 percent of all military orders. They are the supreme masters of the US wartime economy.

"Second, the driving force of the Soviet wartime economy is the socialist state system based on the moral and political unity and patriotic spirit of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, while the driving force of the US wartime economy is the capitalist monopoly organizations, which use war as a source of huge income and a means of competing for world markets...

"Third, on the one hand, the Soviet Union had to bear war expenses during the wartime economy, and on the other hand, it suffered huge losses because many Soviet regions were temporarily occupied by the German Kou. Capitalist America, on the contrary, made a fortune from the war, avoided the impending pre-war economic crisis, and earned unprecedentedly huge profits and new world markets for monopoly capitalists. However, the high level of capitalist accumulation, labor productivity, and production technology achieved by the United States during the war sharpened the contradictions peculiar to the capitalist system and created a foundation for new devastating economic crises and chronic unemployment... All of this shows that the foundation of the Soviet wartime economy is fundamentally opposite to the foundation of the US wartime economy, just as the socialist system is fundamentally opposite to the capitalist system."

Finally, he concluded: "It can be seen from this that the foundation of the Soviet wartime economy is the dominant position of the socialist ownership of the means of production, which enables us to concentrate all the material forces of the Soviet national economy to carry out the victorious Patriotic War." (ibid., Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House edition, pages 32-34).

In short, the role of productive forces in war depends on what system they are under, in the hands of what people or what class, and for what purpose. Even with the same size of productive forces, if they are within the capitalist system, in the hands of the big bourgeoisie, and serve the reactionary war and the war profits of the capitalists, then they are far less great than the role played in a socialist country or a new democratic country. Here, they are in the hands of the state led by the working class, serving the interests of the people or the purpose of the liberation war. In a socialist country or in a new democratic country, on the surface, even if their production capacity seems to be smaller than that of imperialist countries, the role played by the former in war is still greater than that of the latter. This is not only a question of quantity, but also a question of quality.

It was precisely because of this that in the early days of the Soviet-German War, despite the great destruction and losses suffered by the Soviet economy, and the large reduction in production volume, it was finally able to quickly overcome the difficulties, begin a new upsurge, and finally defeat fascist Germany. For example, from June to November 1941, due to the huge losses caused by the war and the relocation of hundreds of enterprises, the total industrial output of the Soviet Union was reduced by about half. However, due to the superiority of the Soviet economic system, due to Stalin's wise leadership and the heroic efforts of the Soviet people, the military industry finally not only restored its lost production capacity in the first half of 1943, but also greatly exceeded its lost production capacity. From December 1941, it once again began to rise again. It is estimated that the total output of various industrial sectors of the Soviet Union increased by more than 50 percent in 1942, and increased by 17 percent in 1943 compared with 1942. Do not forget that during the most difficult years of the war, the so-called "allied countries" such as Britain and the United States were watching from the sidelines. The Soviet Union was almost fighting independently, using its own once-reduced production capacity to confront the production capacity of the entire Europe under Hitler's Germany. Throughout the entire war, the supplies of the so-called "allied countries" accounted for only 4 percent of the Soviet Union's own production.

This example proves that it is groundless to simply use the size of a country's production capacity to measure the outcome of a war.

This example proves that it is groundless to be afraid of the superficial production capacity of the United States and lack confidence in the anti-aggression war.

Finally, this example proves that any "economic fear of America disease" is as groundless as other aspects of the "fear of America disease."

　　美帝扩大侵略战争之经济的分析
　　关梦觉
            第一、论美帝扩大侵略战争的经济动力
    美帝国主义为什么这样疯狂地扩大侵略战争呢？从经济方面来说，过去三十多年来它是喝战争的鲜血长肥的，而目前在世界资本主义总危机空前严重的背景之下，由于生产力和生产关系的基本矛盾极端尖锐，它在经济上业已走到绝路，面临着毁灭性的经济危机，乃推着它进行军事冒险，由疯狂地准备战争到公然发动侵朝战争，更由发动战争到扩大战争，严重地威胁着我国的安全与世界和平。
    在这里，简单地追溯一下最近三十多年来美帝国主义的战争发家史。当一九一四年秋天第一次世界大战爆发的时候，美国正处在经济萧条之中，因为战争的关系，它才克服了那次不景气的难关，而开始进入一个生产活跃与工业发展的时期。这种由军火订单的洪流所造成的“战争繁荣”，不仅继续于第一次大战的四年当中，并且——除一九二○——二一年那次小危机以外——一直贯穿着一九二○年以后的整整十年。这就是说，从一九一八年大战终了，直到一九二九年十月的大危机爆发，由于战后满目疮痍的欧洲各国的重建，美国的商品曾大量向国外输出，构成了这十年“景气”的基础。因此，在第一次世界大战期内及此后十余年间，美国资本主义曾喝饱了战争的鲜血，日趋成长壮大。可是当战后重建终了的时候，到一九二九年秋天，就爆发了空前严重的生产过剩的经济危机。单在美国，一度就有一千七百万工人失业。可见离开了战争这条“拐棍”，美国生产力的空前增大和人民消费力的空前缩小（相对的和绝对的）这一矛盾，就轰然爆发了。在一九三○年以后的十年当中，美国经济始终患着贫血病，只有三分之二的生产能力在开工，失业人数从未降至一千万人以下。
    只是当一九三九年第二次大战在欧洲爆发的时候，美国工业才又获得了源源不断的军火订单的滋养，而现出活气。在第二次大战期间，美国经济又空前“繁荣”起来了。根据福斯特与艾伦等合著的《经济危机与冷战》一书的材料，从一九四○年到一九四四年，工业生产曾增加了百分之一一六；工业生产能力约增加了百分之四十；工业生产能力的利用率约增加了三分之一（但即在战争生产的最高峰，亦未能充分利用，例如一九四四年即约有百分之十五的生产能力未被利用）；贸易输出额从一九三九年的三十二亿美元，增加到一九四四年的一百四十三亿美元；（一九四五年战争一停就又落到九十八亿美元）失业人数从一九三九年的约近一千万人，减到一九四四年的七十万人；在四年战争期间，各独占集团共获得了八百七十多亿美元的利润（从一九三九年的六十四亿美元，增加到一九四三年的二百四十五亿美元），而工人们的基本工资率，则从一九三九年到一九四四年，只增加了百分之二十二，工人们的生产率则增加了百分之二十五。总之，美国资本主义又做了一次“黄金梦”，独占资本家们又上了一次“天堂”。
    然而战时生产力的急遽增长，却使战后美国资本主义的基本矛盾——生产力与生产关系的矛盾，表现为生产力与消费力或购买力之间的矛盾——更加严重了。战争的吗啡针一经停止，美国的生产力就使美国资本主义社会的“肚子”胀得要命，战后几年来的虚伪“繁荣”转眼过去了，于是乃开始发生阵痛，眼看就要产生一个蹂躏整个资本主义世界的“孽种”——比一九二九年那次更严重的经济危机。事实上，美国在一九四八年秋天就开始了新的生产过剩的危机。例如，从一九四八年十一月到一九四九年七月，工业生产曾跌落了百分之十五；完全失业的人数从一九四八年十月的一百六十万人增加到一九四九年四月的五百万人左右。美帝国主义者深怕这次危机一旦充分展开，将要根本颠覆整个资本主义世界，而独占资本家们也将从血腥的“天堂”跌到十八层地狱。怎么办呢？在他们看来，基本问题就是如何去“填平”过度发展了的生产力与美国及其他国家日趋衰落的购买力之间的巨大鸿沟。他们主张以一个庞大的战争经济体制来“填平补齐”生产与消费之间的空隙，每年拿几十亿、几百亿美元的军火订单，去喂养美国的工业。独占资本家们，认为战争订货和战争本身，乃是维持工业所必需的。换句话说，美国的战时经济根本就不能恢复为平时经济，而平时经济也就根本无以区别于战时经济。从此平时经济和战时经济，再也没有什么严格的界限了。从此，美国资本主义再也离不开战争这条“拐棍”了。正因为如此，所以第二次大战刚一停止，杜鲁门政府就开始了新的疯狂备战。战后，美帝国主义的所谓“管理经济”，其实就是一种战争经济。福斯特说得好：“杜鲁门的‘管理经济’就是一种军国主义、帝国主义和战争的政策”（《经济危机与冷战》原文第七页）；“经济情况越恶化，战争的危机越增长”（同上第五页）。经济动力与征服全世界的政治的和军事的野心互相结合，终于推动着美帝国主义者由准备战争到发动战争，更由发动战争到扩大战争。于是美国大资产阶级又走“血运”了。本来，战后几年来，主要是由于杜鲁门政府的积极备战政策，以及战后的疯狂向外侵略，如同马歇尔计划之类，再加上美国取消了物价管制，连同其他暂时发生作用的因素，美国的大独占资本家们就已经获得了甚至比战时还要更多的利润。例如，一九四六年为一二五亿，一九四七年为一七四亿，一九四八年为二四六亿，一九四九年约为二六五亿，一九五○年据杜鲁门估计，可能达三百亿到三○五亿。侵朝战争发动后，美国政府马上又追加了三百多亿美元的军费，其中一百七十多亿用于购买“货物”，并且绝大部分是购买“硬货”，即飞机、大炮、坦克等等。这样，美国及其仆从国家人民的血汗金钱；乃又通过了杜鲁门政府之手，滚滚流入了军火商人们的腰包；美国及其仆从国家人民的鲜血，又筑成了美国大资产阶级的“金山”。
    美国大资产阶级认为战争是他们的“出路”，是他们的“救命圈”。果真如此吗？事实上完全相反。就整个资本主义制度来说，战争非但不是什么救命圈，而恰巧就是帝国主义的“催命符”。第一次大战，在世界六分之一的领土上打垮了资本主义，出现了第一个社会主义国家苏联，并使资本主义陷入万劫不复的总危机之中；第二次世界大战以后，东欧和东南欧的半壁河山又脱离了资本主义统治，出现了一群新民主国家，外加上德意志人民共和国，在东方，则中国革命成功，四亿七千五百万人民粉碎了帝国主义的枷锁，朝鲜民主主义共和国、越南人民共和国也先后成立，其他殖民地、半殖民地国家也都燃起了民族解放斗争的烽火。总之，资本主义的总危机是加倍严重了。假如以美国为首的帝国主义阵营敢于发动第三次世界大战，其结果必然是整个资本主义制度的最后毁灭。
    过去日本帝国主义和德国帝国主义都是从战争中长大的，最后也在战争中垮台；同样的，从战争中发家的美帝国主义，今天也一定要在战争中死亡。这正是所谓“玩火自焚”。
            第二、论美国的生产力与侵略战争
    美帝国主义的生产能力虽不算小，但生产能力本身并不等于战争力量，必须与足够的人力及其他条件密切结合起来，才能发挥其作用。关于战争的单纯生产力观点，也就是唯武器论的一个变种，它是机械的、片面的、不切实际的。斯大林曾说过，胜利的保障是高昂的士气（这与战争的性质有关）、巩固的后方（帝国主义不可能有巩固的后方）、国家的经济威力（美帝国主义的生产力虽不算小，但因缺乏其他条件配合，威力不大）、大量与优秀的师团（这正是美帝国主义的致命伤之一）等等因素。马列主义的军事科学从不把人的作用与物的作用孤立起来看；资产阶级军事学者的形而上学观点却往往夸大了物的作用，而抹煞了人的作用。关于这一点，甚至连美国自己的某些军事评论家，例如麦克斯·威尔纳都不以为然。他曾说过：“这些年来我们的政治和军事领导上，用来测量军事力量的尺度，是金元、拨款、生产量和原子弹的储藏量。这不是军事计划家的观念，而是工程师和商业经理的观念。这种观念把战争的产业基础从有组织的战斗力量中割裂出来”；“单靠生产量是打不了胜仗的，这点完全被人忘记了”；“一个国家所有的军事力量，决不能超出它所有的实际战斗力。假如没有足够的战士和战斗部队去使用可供使用的军事武器和机械，那么，未经使用的机械装备必须作为军事剩余品而予以勾销”；“一切主张大规模生产动员和增加战争生产量的要求，都不能够改变美国和西欧军事机构中的这个主要缺陷：缺少有训练、有组织的战斗力量。……美国和西欧战争工业大量生产出来的地面武器，受到了一种战略失业的威胁”。
    然而问题尚不止此。谈到生产力时，不能撇开生产关系，即社会的经济制度；撇开生产关系而孤立地去看生产力，那是片面的，错误的、而且是有害的。生产力在战争中的作用如何，须与生产关系结合起来看，那才是正确合理的。生产力与生产关系结合起来，构成了一个国家的生产方式，也构成了一个国家的经济威力。举例来说，我们可以比较一下第二次大战中美国与苏联的战时经济。沃兹涅先斯基在“卫国战争期内的苏联战时经济”的权威者作中，对此曾有过极科学的分析。他说：“苏联战时经济……根本区别于各资本主义国家的战时经济。这种区别，可以从苏联战时经济基础与例如美国战时经济基础的比较中看得出来。
    “第一、苏联战时经济是以建筑在生产资料公有制上的社会主义经济为基础的，而美国战时经济则是资本主义的经济，并且是已经发展到了由资本家垄断组织和财政资本占统治的阶段上的资本主义经济。在第二次世界大战期间，美国资本家垄断组织的统治已在资本进一步集合、集中的基础上猛烈的加强起来了。……只须指出，在一九四四年美国全部军事订货中，有百分之七十五是由一百家大资本垄断组织领去，其中三十个极大的垄断资本家领到了全部军事订货的百分之四十九。他们是美国战时经济的太上主人翁。
    “第二、苏联战时经济的动力是以苏联各族人民道义上、政治上一致及其爱国精神为依据的社会主义国家制度，而美国战时经济的动力则是资本家垄断组织，它们利用战争作为获得巨大收入的泉源和争夺世界市场的手段。……
    “第三、苏联在战时经济期间一方面因必须担负战费，另一方面又因为有许多苏维埃区域暂时被德寇占领而受到过庞大的损失。资本主义的美国却与此相反，它靠战争发了大财，避免了临来的战前经济危机，并为垄断资本家挣得了空前巨大的利润与新的世界市场。然而战时美国所达到的资本主义积累，劳动生产率及生产技术的高度水准，却使资本主义制度所特有的矛盾尖锐化，并为新的毁灭性的经济危机和慢性的失业现象造成基础。……凡此种种，都表明苏联战时经济的基础与美国战时经济的基础根本相反，正如社会主义制度与资本主义制度根本相反一样。”
    最后他总结说：“由此可见，苏联战时经济的基础就是社会主义生产资料所有制占统治地位，这种统治地位，使我们能于把苏联国民经济所有的一切物质力量集中起来，进行胜利的卫国战争。”（上书莫斯科外文出版局版，第三二——三四页）。
    总之，生产力在战争中所起的作用如何，要看它们是在什么制度之下，在什么人或什么阶级的掌握之中，为了什么目的。同是一样大小的生产力，如果是在资本主义的制度内，在大资产阶级的掌握中，为反动的战争和资本家的战争利润而服务，那么，它们就远不如在社会主义国家或新民主主义国家内所发挥的作用那么伟大。在这里，它们是掌握在以工人阶级为领导的国家手里，为人民大众的利益或为解放战争的目的而服务。在社会主义国家或在新民主主义国家中，表面上看来，甚至它们的生产能力似乎要比帝国主义国家的生产能力小些，但前者在战争中所发挥的作用还是要大于后者。这不仅是一个量的问题，而且是一个质的问题。
    正因为如此，所以在苏德战争初期，尽管苏联经济曾遭到了极大的破坏和损失，生产量曾大为降低，但终能迅速克服困难，开始了新的高涨，最后战胜了法西斯德国。例如从一九四一年六月到十一月间，由于战争所引起的巨大损失以及数百个企业内迁的结果，苏联工业总产量曾减少了约一半。然而由于苏联经济制度的优越性，由于斯大林的英明领导和苏联人民的英勇努力，终于使军用工业在一九四三年上半年不仅恢复了所丧失的生产能力，而且还大大超过了所丧失的生产能力。从一九四一年十二月起，就又重新高涨起来，计一九四二年全年苏联各工业部门产品总量增加了百分之五十以上，而一九四三年又比一九四二年增加了百分之十七。不要忘记，在战争最艰苦的年月，英、美等所谓“盟国”，正在作壁上观，苏联几乎是独立抗战，用它自己一度减少了的生产能力去对抗希特勒德国掌握下的全欧洲的生产能力。在整个战争期间，所谓“盟国”的供给，不过只占苏联本国产量的百分之四而已。
    从这个例子中就可以证明：单纯拿一国生产力的量的大小，去衡量战争的胜负，是毫无根据的。
    从这个例子中就可以证明：害怕美国表面上的生产力大，对于反侵略战争缺乏信心，是毫无根据的。
    最后，从这个例子中就可以证明：任何的“经济恐美病”也和其他方面的“恐美病”一样，是毫无根据的。
