Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 6th: A grand meeting was held in Moscow on the 6th by representatives of the Moscow City Soviet, the Communist Party, mass organizations, and the Soviet Army to celebrate the 33rd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. Bulganin, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, delivered a report at the meeting, the full text of which is as follows:

	Comrades! Today, all the peoples of the Soviet Union are celebrating the 33rd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. The Great October Socialist Revolution began a new era—an era of workers liberating themselves from capitalist enslavement.

	The October Revolution awakened unprecedented creativity and initiative in our people. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people have demonstrated unparalleled heroism in both peaceful labor and armed defense of the motherland. They have overcome infinite difficulties and, in a short historical period, created the Soviet socialist system and are now confidently marching towards the great goal of communism.

	Our Soviet system, born in the victory of the October Revolution, is now influencing the development of the entire world history and has brought about tremendous changes in it. The principles proclaimed by the October Revolution have now united and firmly bonded the great socialist democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union. We rightly consider this a great victory for Marxism-Leninism.

	The entire course of events proves the correctness of the Marxist-Leninist doctrine on the inevitable collapse of capitalism. Capitalism entered its final stage of development—the stage of imperialism—at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. The entire course of events confirms the scientific conclusion of Marxism-Leninism: that once the working class has the leadership of a revolutionary Marxist party, it constitutes a force capable of arousing the working people to fight for liberation from capitalist enslavement, capable of seizing state power in society, and capable of achieving the lofty goal of building socialism. As an example of brotherly cooperation between nations, the construction of the Soviet state convinces the peoples of other countries of the superiority of socialism over capitalism and of the indestructible truth of Marxism-Leninism.

	(I) Historical Achievements in the Domestic Development of the Soviet Union

	On this great 33rd anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet people have a record of significant achievements in all sectors of political, economic, and cultural life.

	The Political and Economic Strength of the Soviet Union is Further Enhanced

	The Prestige of the Soviet Government is Further Increased

	The important achievement that we must point out on the anniversary of the October Revolution is that the political and economic strength of the Soviet socialist state has been further increased and enhanced. The Soviet government—the most democratic government in the world, enjoying the full trust and love of its people—has not only increased its prestige among the Soviet people in these post-war years, but its prestige has also increased among the working people of other countries. Our Soviet system ensures that the broad masses of the people can actively participate in state and public life; this is the most effective form of government for promoting their creative abilities. Our leading and guiding force is the Communist Party. The Soviet people regard the Party's policies as their own, because they see that the Party's policies embody their interests. No bourgeois government in the world can have such a stable and unshakable political position at home as the Soviet government.

	The achievements of the Soviet people in these peaceful years have further strengthened the spirit of Soviet patriotism in our people. Comrade Stalin taught us that the strength of this patriotism is due to the fact that it is not built on racial or national prejudice, but on the people's great faith in and loyalty to their motherland, and on the brotherly cooperation of the working people of all nationalities in our country.

	The brotherly cooperation and friendship among the various nationalities in our country have been promoted and strengthened by their constructive labor for the benefit of their socialist state. With the support of the entire Soviet Union, the economies of the formerly enemy-ravaged areas have been rapidly revived from destruction and have made rapid progress.

	United in a friendly family of various nationalities, all our Union Republics have made great achievements in the political, economic, and cultural fields in the past few years.

	This struggle to achieve the great goal of communist construction is constantly strengthening the spiritual and political unity of Soviet society, which is tightly united around the Party and the Soviet government. The results of the elections to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the Supreme Soviets of the various Union Republics held in the post-war years convincingly prove this, representing a brilliant victory for the Stalinist Communist Party and the non-Party alliance.

	The superiority of the Soviet social and state system, which had been very powerfully demonstrated during the war, has also been fully demonstrated during the period of peaceful development.

	The Main Tasks of the Five-Year Plan Have Been Successfully Completed

	Total Industrial Output Exceeds Pre-War Levels by Seventy Percent

	The foundation of the Soviet people's post-war economic and cultural activities is the Five-Year Plan for the Restoration and Development of the National Economy (1946-1950), which was implemented immediately after the end of the Great Patriotic War—the most arduous war our country has ever experienced. The material losses suffered by our country during the war were so severe that our enemies were counting on them for their selfish purposes.

	They hoped that we would not be able to overcome the post-war difficulties on our own. But their calculations proved to be completely unfounded. The strength and potential of the Soviet Union were not only sufficient to heal the wounds of war, but also to promote further strong growth in industry, transportation, agriculture, culture, and the material well-being of the working people.

	The Soviet people enthusiastically supported the Five-Year Plan, regarding it as a program of action, a program that conformed to their vital interests, and under the guidance of the Communist Party, they set about implementing this plan with great enthusiasm. The Soviet people spared no effort to strive for the completion and over-completion of this post-war Five-Year Plan. During these years, the Soviet people once again demonstrated their outstanding qualities and creativity, and their political consciousness and social activity reached new levels.

	The post-war Five-Year Plan is a new and brilliant stage in our country's development.

	The main tasks of the Five-Year Plan were to rebuild the regions of our country that had been ravaged by war, to restore the pre-war levels of industry and agriculture, and then to greatly exceed these levels. Today, we can say with pride in our great country that these tasks of the Five-Year Plan have been successfully completed.

	The Five-Year Plan stipulated that the total output of Soviet industry in 1950 should exceed the pre-war level of 1940 by 48 percent. Now our industry has not only reached this prescribed production volume, but has greatly exceeded it. As everyone knows, as early as the fourth quarter of 1949, the average monthly total output had already exceeded the same quarter of 1940 by 53 percent. This year, industrial output has further increased. In the first ten months of 1950, it exceeded the pre-war total industrial output level by 70 percent.

	The high-speed increase in industrial production and the development of all sectors of our national economy are guaranteed by the extensive capital construction that has been carried out. During the past period of implementing the post-war Five-Year Plan, nearly six thousand factories have been rebuilt or newly built, not counting the smaller state-owned factories and cooperative factories.

	The industry of the states that suffered from war damage has not only been fully restored, but has also been greatly expanded, with new and more modern equipment added.

	The task of restoring and developing heavy industry has been victoriously completed first and foremost.

	Steel Production Exceeds Pre-War Levels by Forty-Four Percent

	Coal Production Has Increased by Fifty-Seven Percent

	The target set by the Five-Year Plan for developing the steel industry has been exceeded. According to the Five-Year Plan, steel production in 1950 was to increase by 35 percent compared to 1940. In the first ten months of this year, steel production has exceeded pre-war levels by 44 percent—pig iron by 28 percent, steel by 48 percent, and rolled metal by 58 percent.

	Achieving these results required our metalworkers and construction workers to do a lot of work. As you all know, the steel industry in the south was completely destroyed during the war, and now it has been completely rebuilt on a new technological basis, and its output is higher than pre-war levels. In the eastern states, the steel industry continues to expand. The output of rolled metal in these regions is currently two and a half times higher than before the war.

	According to the Five-Year Plan targets for non-ferrous metal production, the production of non-ferrous and rare metals such as aluminum, tin, nickel, copper, lead, zinc, magnesium, as well as tungsten and molybdenum ores, has greatly increased.

	The Five-Year Plan's coal mining target has also been exceeded.

	According to the Five-Year Plan, coal production in 1950 was to increase by 51 percent compared to 1940. In the first ten months of this year, coal production has increased by 57 percent compared to pre-war levels, making the Soviet Union the second largest coal producer in the world today.

	The Donbas coal mining industry, which was completely destroyed during the war, has now been completely restored. Donbas coal mines currently produce more coal than before the war and have exceeded the output stipulated in the Five-Year Plan.

	Donbas has once again become the country's largest and most highly mechanized coalfield.

	The Moscow coalfield, which was also completely destroyed, now produces three times more coal than before the war.

	Simultaneous with the revival of the Donbas and Moscow coalfields, the coal mining industries of the Urals, Kuzbass, Karaganda, and other eastern regions have also been further developed. The eastern regions now produce twice as much coal as before the war. The Five-Year Plan target of expanding the Pechora coalfield—a new source of coal for the northern regions and Leningrad—has now been exceeded. New coalfields are also being developed in other regions.

	Oil Production Increases by Twenty-One Percent

	Electricity Generation Has Increased by Eighty-Seven Percent

	Our oil industry is booming. The Five-Year Plan target for oil production has been exceeded. This plan stipulated that oil production in 1950 should be 14 percent higher than before the war. In the first ten months of this year, oil production has increased by 21 percent compared to pre-war levels.

	The oil industries of Megehob in Western Ukraine and Grozny were completely destroyed during the war. Now, they have been completely restored and technically re-equipped.

	The importance of the new oilfields in the east has greatly increased, with rapid progress being made in the Kuibyshev Oblast and the republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan. In the Tatar Republic, new large oilfields have been established. Large-scale projects are underway to develop oil production on Sakhalin Island. The eastern states today produce 44 percent of the total Soviet oil production, compared to only 12 percent in 1940.

	The oil refining industry has been technically re-equipped. New types of high-octane aviation fuel and other oils and lubricants are currently being produced.

	The power generation in the final year of the Five-Year Plan should be 70 percent higher than before the war; but in fact, power generation has increased by 87 percent. In the areas that suffered from war damage, many power plants were completely destroyed; today, their capacity and power generation have exceeded pre-war levels.

	The machine manufacturing industry is also developing rapidly, and the Five-Year Plan targets for the production of machinery, equipment, and tools are being successfully completed. According to the Five-Year Plan, machine production in 1950 will be twice that of pre-war levels. In the first ten months of this year, machine production has increased to 2.2 times that of pre-war levels. The production of steel industry equipment has increased fivefold, the production of steam turbines has increased two and a half times, the production of powerful electric motors has increased fivefold, the production of oil industry equipment has increased more than threefold, and the production of excavators has increased thirteenfold.

	Relying on the achievements of our scientists, the Soviet machine manufacturing personnel have designed and manufactured many of the latest machines and equipment in the past few years.

	During the period of the Five-Year Plan, the efficiency of industrial equipment operation has greatly improved. For example, the efficiency of blast furnace operation has increased by 25 percent compared to pre-war levels, and the efficiency of steelmaking furnace operation has increased by 32 percent. The drilling speed of oil wells has increased by 43 percent compared to pre-war levels. However, the various performances of our advanced workers and advanced factories and workshops indicate that there is still enormous potential for more effectively using equipment and increasing production.

	Due to the successful adoption of new equipment, it has been possible to continue the technical transformation of our national economy on a large scale, and to improve the level of mechanization of production processes and heavy work that consume a lot of physical labor. At the same time, technological progress and the increase in the skills of our production personnel, as well as the creative suggestions of workers, engineers, and technicians, have greatly increased labor productivity.

	The Five-Year Plan stipulated that labor productivity in industry in 1950 should increase by 36 percent compared to pre-war levels. In fact, the labor productivity of our industrial workers in the third quarter of 1950 increased by more than 40 percent compared to pre-war levels. Effective measures are now being taken in industry to save raw materials, semi-finished products, fuel, and power, to more effectively utilize production space, and to accelerate the turnover of working capital. As a result, the government's plan to reduce the cost of industrial products is being completed and over-completed.

	In terms of railway operations, as in industrial production, the Five-Year Plan targets are also being exceeded. According to the Five-Year Plan, the volume of railway freight transport in 1950 should increase by 28 percent compared to pre-war levels. In fact, the volume of railway freight transport in the first ten months of this year has increased by more than 40 percent compared to pre-war levels. Locomotive and freight car parking facilities have been expanded and rebuilt, and a domestic industry for the production of electric locomotives and diesel locomotives has been established.

	Agricultural Production Has Made Great Progress

	Grain and Cotton Production Have Increased Significantly

	Great progress has also been made in agriculture. This year, the total grain harvest was 7.6 billion poods, an increase of 300 million poods compared to the 1940 harvest. The total wheat harvest has exceeded the 1940 harvest by 340 million poods.

	The total cotton harvest has increased by more than 40 percent compared to 1940. Sugar beet production has also increased. This year, our sugar beet harvest will be at least 25 million centners higher than in 1940.

	A plan was adopted in 1948 for planting protective forest belts, adopting grassland crop rotation systems, and building ponds and reservoirs in the grassland and forest-grassland zones of the European part of the Soviet Union. Victorious progress is now being made in implementing this plan. In these two years, 1.3 million hectares of forests have been planted, and thousands of ponds and reservoirs have been built on the land of collective farms and state farms in these states.

	An important decision was passed in August this year, stipulating the adoption of a new irrigation system in an area of more than 4.3 million hectares. This new irrigation system stipulates the use of temporary irrigation ditches instead of permanent irrigation ditches that hinder the use of modern machinery in agriculture, which will enable us to expand the area of irrigated land and greatly increase labor productivity in irrigated farming.

	This year, the efforts of the Party and the government have been directed towards solving the central problem of our agriculture, and the overall development of livestock breeding. The three-year plan for the development of productive livestock breeding on collective farms and state farms is now being successfully completed. Collective farms and state farms have greatly increased the number of cattle and sheep herds and their livestock products.

	During the war, our livestock industry suffered very serious losses. In the most important agricultural areas of the country, in Ukraine, the North Caucasus, Belarus, and the states of the Central Black Earth Region, all livestock was completely destroyed, except for a small number that were withdrawn to the east or hidden by residents.

	Livestock breeding in other parts of the country was also damaged during the war. But despite this, our productive livestock breeding industry has now not only fully reached pre-war levels, but has greatly exceeded pre-war levels. The number of edible and dairy cattle in collective farms has increased by 38 percent compared to pre-war levels; the number of sheep and goats has increased by 65 percent; and the number of horses has increased by 55 percent. Collective farms and state farms have greatly increased the number of purebred livestock.

	Large-scale measures are now being taken in collective farms and state farms to establish well-equipped buildings for raising livestock, and to establish adequate feed supplies: special feed crop rotation is being implemented, the planting of pastures is being promoted, the cultivation of feed and root crops is being expanded, and the cultivation of new high-yielding feed crops such as Sudan grass is being promoted.

	The increase in the production of grain crops and industrial crops, as well as the increase in the output of livestock breeding, has created a solid raw material base for the further expansion of our light industry and food industry.

	The Party and the government have provided valuable assistance to collective farms, state farms, and machinery and tractor stations. The supply of various machines for agriculture is also increasing. Our tractor and agricultural machinery factories, which were damaged during the war, have now been completely rebuilt, and these factories, together with the newly established factories, are supplying agriculture with more machines this year than in 1940, namely: tractors (averaging 15 horsepower each) four times more than in 1940, combine harvesters 3.8 times more, tractor-drawn plows four times more, tractor-drawn seeders six times more, and tractor-drawn cultivators three times more.

	Our chemical industry is supplying agriculture with more and more inorganic fertilizers. This year, our agriculture has received almost twice as much phosphorus, potassium, and nitrogen fertilizer as in 1940.

	The operation of large-scale collective agriculture equipped with modern machinery requires knowledge in all aspects of collective farming economics, agricultural technology, and the principles of agricultural mechanization. Capable agricultural organizers, managers, and experts have emerged from the ranks of collective farmers. However, we cannot be satisfied with this, so the Party and the government believe that we must further strengthen our collective farms, and apply the latest achievements of agricultural science and advanced practical experience to collective farms and machinery and tractor stations.

	National Income Exceeds Original Five-Year Plan Target

	The Living Standards of the Working People Have Improved Day by Day

	Accompanying the progress of the national economy is the increase in national income, and the continuous improvement of the living standards and cultural levels of our people.

	In capitalist countries, the vast majority of the national income created by workers is seized by the exploiting classes. Under the Soviet socialist economic system, national income belongs to the working people. Its distribution is not for the purpose of expanding the wealth of the exploiting classes, but for the systematic improvement of the material conditions of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, and the expansion of socialist production. Therefore, the growth of national income in the Soviet state is the richest and most vivid indicator of the rising living standards of the working masses.

	According to the Five-Year Plan, the national income in 1950 will increase by 38 percent compared to pre-war levels. However, as early as 1949, the Soviet Union's national income had actually reached this level, and in 1950, the national income, calculated in terms of prices, increased by more than 60 percent compared to pre-war levels, which greatly exceeded the original target of the Five-Year Plan.

	As everyone knows, the Soviet government implemented monetary reforms and continuously reduced prices. In 1950, retail prices of daily necessities were reduced for the third time. This further strengthened the Soviet ruble and increased its purchasing power. As early as 1949, average wages and salaries (calculated in terms of prices) increased by 24 percent compared to pre-war levels. Farmers' income increased by 30 percent accordingly. This year, we have seen a continued increase in real wages and salaries and farmers' income.

	Everyone knows that there is no unemployment in our country. The number of people employed in the national economy is continuing to increase, and has now increased by 22 percent compared to pre-war levels.

	The improvement in the living standards of the working people is reflected in the increase in people's purchasing power and the growth in trade volume. Compared with pre-war levels, the sales volume of goods supplied to the people through state-owned stores and cooperative stores this year, excluding local supplies, has increased as follows: meat and meat products by 35 percent, fish by 53 percent, butter and other oils and fats by 60 percent, sugar and confectionery by 30 percent, cotton fabrics, wool, silk, and linen textiles by 38 percent, shoes by 35 percent, socks by 37 percent, and soaps by 31 percent.

	People's consumption has greatly improved compared to pre-war levels.

	The Party and the government regard it as a top priority to increase housing construction in our country to the maximum extent. In particular, helping workers, peasants, and intellectuals build their own homes. In the four years and ten months of implementing the Five-Year Plan in the past, the total area of reconstructed or newly built housing amounted to approximately 90 million square meters. More than 2.5 million houses have been reconstructed or newly built in rural areas.

	These figures illustrate the scale of housing construction in our country. But these construction plans have not been fully completed in all places. In towns and villages, housing construction is still slow and too expensive.

	The Government Uses Huge Sums of Money to Sponsor Social and Cultural Undertakings

	The Number of Schools and Students Has Increased Greatly Compared to Pre-War Levels

	The government spends huge sums of money to sponsor social and cultural services. Since the end of the war, our country has newly built or rebuilt thousands of new schools, libraries, and kindergartens, as well as a large number of hospitals, sanatoriums, resorts, clubs, theaters, and cinemas.

	Currently, there are a total of 37 million students studying in primary schools, seven-year schools, secondary schools, technical schools, and other secondary schools. There are 1.23 million students in universities and specialized colleges, 400,000 more than before the war.

	Soviet literature and art are constantly developing. In our country, they serve the interests of the people and are important tools for carrying out communist education for Soviet citizens.

	The number of our scientific research institutions has increased. We have taken important new steps to complete the task that Comrade Stalin gave to Soviet scientists—"in the near future, not only to catch up with the achievements of foreign science, but also to surpass them." In addition to discovering the secrets of atomic energy, our scientists have also made many other important works and discoveries, which have helped the progress of technology and the completion and exceeding of our national economic plans.

	The public discussions held this year on various issues in linguistics and physiology have helped to advance the development of our Soviet science.

	Comrade Stalin's contribution to the linguistics discussion is of particular value. First of all, Comrade Stalin's contribution brought about a sharp shift in this science. Comrade Stalin proved that science cannot develop and thrive without controversy, without free criticism, and without replacing old formulas and conclusions with new ones. This has opened up a broad avenue for solving the various new problems facing our country in all fields of Soviet scientific thought.

	When talking about our achievements in economic and cultural fields, we cannot but also mention our glorious armed forces—our army, air force, and navy. They gloriously perform their military duties, and reliably defend the peace and security of our motherland.

	The Government Decides to Carry Out Communist Construction Projects

	Building the Largest Hydropower Stations and Digging Large Canals

	Comrade Stalin taught us that a communist planned economy is based on the highest technical achievements in industry and agriculture. Therefore, we must further promote our Soviet economy, raise the technical equipment of all economic sectors to a higher level, and further develop our productive forces.

	In the struggle to realize these tasks facing the Soviet people, the government's decision to build the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydropower stations on the Volga River, to dig the Turkmen Grand Canal from the Amu Darya to Krasnovodsk, and to build the Kakhovka hydropower station and the South Ukrainian Canal and the North Crimean Canal on the Dnieper River, etc., is of great importance. These projects are truly communist construction projects in terms of their scale, technical originality, and the time limit for their completion. Each project includes the construction of power stations, sluices, supply canals, reservoirs, and irrigation systems. Each project is a combination of complex projects. This kind of work can only be realized in our country under the socialist planned economy.

	The total power generation capacity of the four new hydropower stations will reach 4 million kilowatts, and in years with normal water levels, they can generate 22 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, which is more than ten times the total current generated by all power stations in Tsarist Russia in 1913.

	The Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydropower stations will supply all the electricity needed by Moscow, and will enable the economic development of the Volga region and the Central Black Earth Region to be completed more quickly. At the same time, the Turkmen Grand Canal and the Kakhovka hydropower stations will be sufficient to accelerate the economic development of the Caspian Sea region in Turkmenistan and the lower reaches of the Dnieper River. With these hydropower stations, our country will be able to establish new factories and add the latest equipment to existing factories.

	Due to the irrigation of the Volga, South Ukraine, Northern Crimea, and the desert and semi-desert areas of the Caspian Sea and Central Asia, the production of wheat, rice, cotton, and other industrial crops in our country will increase by millions of poods. In the irrigated areas, livestock breeding will also be greatly expanded. The electricity produced by the newly established hydropower plants will be widely used in industry and agriculture.

	The government's decision to build these factories on the Volga River, the Amu Darya River, and the Dnieper River has received enthusiastic support throughout our country. Workers in many factories in our country have pledged to quickly and perfectly complete the orders for the new construction plans. Soviet scientists, engineers, and specialized technicians are doing their best to use their creativity to solve the various technical problems in the new construction plans. The men and women collective farmers in Volga, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Crimea are guaranteeing to contribute their personal labor in order to accelerate the completion of the construction projects.

	Strengthening the Ideological and Theoretical Education of Cadres

	Unfolding Systematic Criticism and Self-Criticism

	With the development of Soviet society, the profoundness of our cadres in ideology and theory has become increasingly important. The transition from socialism to communism makes it necessary for us to raise all ideological education work to a higher level, and to further improve the communist education work for the working people.

	Communism cannot be established without thoroughly eradicating the capitalist remnants in our people's hearts. Therefore, we must intensify the struggle against various manifestations of non-communist attitudes towards work and socialist property, and towards complying with national interests. We must fundamentally eliminate the influence of the bourgeoisie in science, literature, and art, and tirelessly carry out work to perfect the Marxist-Leninist education of our specialized personnel in various fields, and help them grasp the science of social development laws.

	Our Party requires us not to be satisfied with the achievements we have already made, and not to be complacent about our achievements. It would be a shame to the Soviet people to not pay attention to the shortcomings in our work, and to not take measures to eliminate them.

	For example, we cannot ignore such an intolerable thing as violating the law on the obligation to complete the state plan. In some industrial sectors, some factories consistently fail to complete the tasks assigned to them. The leaders in these industrial sectors comfort themselves by thinking that the poor work results of factories that fail to complete their tasks can be compensated for by the over-completion of tasks by advanced factories.

	This is an incorrect and non-Soviet attitude towards completing the state plan. This behavior of neglecting the poor performance of some factories and compensating for it with the good performance of other factories has nothing in common with Soviet-style enterprise management. This method is incompatible with the managers of socialist enterprises. Only bourgeois operators can think and do this way. The state plan is the law. Every factory has the duty to complete its tasks. This requirement applies not only to the managers of industry, but also to all other sectors of our socialist economy.

	It is equally important to point out the serious shortcomings in the field of capital construction. Comrade Stalin has aroused our attention to these shortcomings. Although on the one hand, due to the development of industrial production, production costs have been reduced, thereby allowing prices to be lowered and the Soviet ruble to be strengthened, at the same time, despite the huge expansion of capital construction work, construction costs have not decreased, but remain excessively high.

	When designing engineering plans, too many unnecessary things are allowed, which increases construction costs. Due to the serious shortcomings existing in the planning of capital construction projects, materials and funds are dispersed to too many engineering plans, resulting in construction being dragged out for too long, the commissioning of new production equipment being delayed, and the number of uncompleted construction projects increasing. In view of the enormous scale of our current capital construction projects, this issue has great national importance.

	The leaders of our construction organizations must get rid of the habit of not completing the targets set by the government regarding reducing construction costs, they must greatly increase the speed of construction, improve their working methods, and no longer lag behind other sectors of our national economy.

	A reliable and long-tested tool for eliminating the shortcomings in our work is Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism. The Party teaches us that criticism and self-criticism is one of the driving forces of socialist society, and it effectively helps to remove old and outdated things, and clears the way for new, advanced, and progressive things. Therefore, criticism and self-criticism must not be used sporadically, but systematically. Criticism and self-criticism must be a constantly functioning tool for improving our work.

	Eliminating the shortcomings in political education and the shortcomings in our economic and cultural work will enable us to discover new potentials for developing socialist production, thereby accelerating our progress towards communism.

	(II) The Soviet Union and the Struggle to Consolidate World Peace

	The Soviet Union, engaged in economic development, is unremittingly striving for peace, friendship, and cooperation among all countries.

	Standing shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet Union in the struggle for international peace and friendship are the people's democratic countries—Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Romania.

	The great Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, are actively fighting for the cause of peace.

	The German Democratic Republic stands firmly in the camp of peace.

	The Korean people are waging a war of liberation for peace and national freedom and independence.

	The people of all these countries constitute the camp of peace, socialism, and democracy.

	The Soviet Government Takes Practical Steps to Promote International Peace and Cooperation

	Comrade Stalin has repeatedly stated that differences in economic systems and ideologies do not preclude cooperation and normal relations between the Soviet Union and capitalist countries, especially between the Soviet Union and the United States.

	Comrade Stalin once said: "Cooperation does not require the people of all countries to have similar systems. Everyone must respect the system approved by the people."

	At the same time, Comrade Stalin pointed out: "A distinction must be made between the possibility of cooperation and the hope of cooperation. The possibility of cooperation always exists, but the willingness to cooperate does not always exist." As for the Soviet Union, it is well known that the Soviet government has made many efforts and taken practical steps to promote international peace and cooperation.

	The camp of socialism and democracy, the camp of peace, is opposed by the imperialist camp, headed by the ruling circles of the United States, which pursues a policy of launching another war—a policy of strong countries ruling weak countries.

	Before the Second World War, the main competitors of American imperialists in the world market were Germany and Japan. Because these countries were defeated in the war, American imperialists are trying to take advantage of the new situation to seize sources of raw materials and markets. But this is not their only goal. American imperialists believe that a new third world war will inevitably lead to the collapse of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, will surely suppress the labor movement and the national liberation movement in all other countries, and will surely establish the world hegemony of American imperialists. The imperialist camp is intensifying the arms race, expanding military spending, increasing the strength of its armed forces, undermining the remaining democratic freedoms at home, and persecuting progressive organizations for these purposes. American imperialists hope to use the armies of their vassal states as cannon fodder to achieve these goals. The ruling groups of Britain and France, which once pursued an independent foreign policy, are currently sacrificing their own national interests and obsequiously obeying the orders of American imperialists on all major international issues.

	The Soviet Union Advocates Peaceful Settlement of the Korean Issue

	American Aggressors Rejected This Proposal

	From the very beginning of the Korean incident, the Soviet Union advocated that the conflict should be resolved by peaceful means. For this purpose, the Soviet government proposed that the Korean War should be stopped immediately, and all foreign troops should be withdrawn from Korea at the same time, so that the Korean people would be able to solve their domestic affairs without foreign interference.

	However, the American government, which is engaged in open aggression, has rejected all proposals for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. This is an objective lesson for the people of all countries, showing who advocates peace and who advocates another war.

	After suffering setbacks and serious defeats in the war against the freedom-loving Korean people, the American military command mobilized almost all available armed forces in the Far East and投入ed them into the Korean War. The United States not only relied on its own troops, but also conscripted the troops of Britain and other countries to participate in the war. Only with the help of these massive troops, which were several times larger than the Korean People's Army, did the interventionists achieve certain military victories.

	The Korean people, after achieving great military victories, are now experiencing a period of military setbacks, but these setbacks have not thwarted their determination to fight.

	There will be setbacks in every war. Our Soviet state also experienced a very difficult period during the period of foreign armed intervention and civil war. But the interventionists were finally defeated and driven out.

	The Korean people, because of their heroic struggle against the American interventionists, have won the sympathy of all peace-loving people in the world, and Korea has become the banner of the liberation movement in many countries.

	The Soviet Union Firmly Advocates Early Conclusion of Peace Treaties with Germany and Japan, the US and Britain Violate Obligations on German and Japanese Issues

	After defeating fascist Germany and imperialist Japan, the great powers, embodying the will of the people of all countries who had experienced the horrors of war, established a system of agreed international relations that guaranteed the peace and security of all countries. The foundation of this system is the Potsdam Agreement and the UN Charter. But the American and British imperialists have long been working to undermine this system of international cooperation. The American and British imperialists bypassed and directly violated the UN Charter to form the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and are organizing other military aggression groups.

	The British and American rulers are obstructing the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and are trying to prolong the occupation of West Germany for as long as possible. At the meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France in New York in September of this year, it was decided to rebuild the German army in West Germany, take practical measures to remilitarize West Germany, and use German manpower and material resources for their own interests, regardless of the national interests of the German people.

	The policy of splitting Germany pursued by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France in violation of the principles of the Potsdam Agreement, has severed the normal economic ties between East and West Germany, and is specifically developing the war-related industrial sectors of West Germany.

	In stark contrast to this is the policy of the Soviet government. It insists on implementing the Potsdam Agreement, which stipulates the establishment of a unified, independent, peace-loving, and democratic Germany. The Soviet government's proposal to quickly conclude a peace treaty with Germany, withdraw the occupying forces, and establish an all-German government is well known. These proposals were reiterated in the recent declaration by the foreign ministers of the eight countries of the Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, Hungary, and the German Democratic Republic.

	The Soviet government also firmly insists on implementing the Potsdam

　　苏联部长会议副主席布尔加宁
    在莫斯科庆祝十月革命节大会上的报告
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科六日电：莫斯科市苏维埃，共产党及群众团体和苏联军队的代表，六日举行庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命三十三周年的盛大集会。苏联部长会议副主席布尔加宁在会上发表报告，全文如下：
    同志们！今天苏联各族人民都在庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命的三十三周年纪念日。伟大的十月社会主义革命开始了一个新纪元——工人自资本主义奴役下求得解放的纪元。
    十月革命唤醒了我国人民空前的创造力和进取心。苏联人民在共产党的领导下，已在和平劳动和武装保卫祖国时表现了无可比拟的英雄主义。他们克服了无限的艰难，在短短的一个历史阶段中，创建了苏维埃社会主义制度，而且现在正满怀信心地向着伟大的目标——共产主义迈进。
    我们的苏维埃制度，是在十月革命的胜利中诞生的，它现在正影响着整个世界历史的发展，使整个世界历史的发展起了巨大的变化。十月革命所揭橥的原则，现在已把以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义民主阵营，团结起来并坚固地结合起来了。我们公正地认为这是马列主义思想的伟大胜利。
    整个局势的演变过程，证明了马列主义关于资本主义必然崩溃的学说的正确性。资本主义在十九世纪末叶及二十世纪初叶，即已进入了它的最后发展阶段——帝国主义阶段。整个局势的演变过程，证实了马克思列宁主义的科学结论：即一旦工人阶级有了革命的马克思主义政党的领导，就构成了一支力量，能够唤醒劳动人民为解脱资本主义的奴役而斗争，能够取得社会中的国家权力，能够达到建设社会主义的崇高目标。作为各民族间兄弟般合作的榜样，苏维埃国家的建设，使其他国家的各族人民深信社会主义对资本主义的优越性，深信马列主义的颠扑不破的真理。
    （一）苏联国内发展方面的历史性成就
    在这个伟大的十月社会主义革命三十三周年纪念日，苏联人民在政治、经济与文化生活一切部门中是有着重大成就的纪录的。
    苏联政治经济力量更形强大
    苏维埃政府的威望更形增加
    在十月革命纪念日，我们所必须要指出的重要成绩是：苏维埃社会主义国家的政治与经济力量，已经更形增大和增强。苏维埃政府——这是世界上最民主而且享受其人民的充分信赖与爱戴的政府——在战后的这些年代里，不仅在苏联人民中已经更形增加其威望，就在其他国家的劳动人民中，它的威望也更形增加了。我们的苏维埃制度保证广大人民群众都能积极地参加国家与公共生活；这是最能促进他们创造能力的一种政府形式。我们的领导与指导的力量是共产党，苏联人民认为党的政策就是他们的政策，因为他们看到党的政策体现了他们的利益。世界上任何一个资产阶级政府，在国内的政治地位都不能像苏维埃政府那样的稳固而不可动摇。
    苏联人民在这些和平年代里所获得的成就，已进一步加强了我国人民的苏维埃爱国主义的情绪，斯大林同志教导我们说，这种爱国主义的力量是由于以下的事实：即它不是建筑在种族或民族的偏见上，而是建筑在人民对其祖国的极大信仰与忠诚上，建筑在我国各民族劳动人民的兄弟般的合作上。
    我国各族人民间的兄弟般的合作与友谊，已由他们为了他们社会主义国家的利益所作的建设性劳动而促进和加强了。在全苏联的支持之下，前敌人蹂躏区的经济，已经迅速地从毁灭中复兴起来，并且有了很快的进展。
    团结在一个各民族友好的大家庭内，我们所有的加盟共和国过去数年内在政治、经济与文化方面的成就都是很大的。
    为了达到共产主义建设的伟大目标而进行的这种斗争，正在不断地加强苏维埃社会的精神与政治上的团结，而苏维埃社会是紧紧地团结在党与苏维埃政府的周围的。战后年代里所举行的苏联最高苏维埃以及各加盟共和国最高苏维埃的选举结果，令人信服地证明了这一点，这是斯大林的共产党和非党联盟的辉煌胜利。
    在战争时期已经非常有力地表现出来的苏维埃社会与国家制度的优越性，在和平发展时期也同样充分地表现了出来。
    五年计划的主要任务已胜利完成
    工业总产量超过战前百分之七十
    苏维埃人民战后时期的经济与文化活动的基础，是复兴与发展国民经济的五年计划（一九四六——五○），该计划是在伟大的爱国战争——我国所经历的最艰苦的一次战争——结束后立即施行的。战争使我国所受的物质损失非常严重，以致我们的敌人都在这上面打了它自私的算盘。
    他们希望我们不能靠自己的努力克服战后的困难。但是他们的计算证明是丝毫没有根据的。苏联的实力和潜力不仅足以治愈了战争的创伤，而且足以促使工业、运输业、农业、文化和劳动人民的物质福利都获得进一步的有力的提高。
    苏联人民热烈拥护五年计划，把它看做是一个行动纲领，一个符合于他们的切身利益的纲领，并且在共产党的指导下满怀热情地着手实行这个计划。苏联人民不遗余力地争取这个战后五年计划的完成与超计划完成。在这些年代里，苏联人民再一次表现了他们的杰出的品质与创造能力，而且他们的政治觉悟和社会活动都达到了新的水平。
    战后的五年计划，在我国的发展中，是一个新的光辉的阶段。
    五年计划的主要任务是重建我国受战争蹂躏的地区，恢复战前的工业与农业水平，然后大大地超过这个水平。今天，我们可以怀着对我们伟大国家的自豪心情来说：五年计划的这些任务已经胜利地完成了。
    五年计划规定一九五○年苏联工业的总产量应超过战前一九四○年水平的百分之四十八。现在我们的工业不仅达到了这个规定的生产量，而且已经大大地超过了。大家都知道：早在一九四九年第四季中，平均每月的总产量已比一九四○年同季超过了百分之五十三。今年工业产量又有了进一步的增加。在一九五○年头十个月中，已超过战前工业总产量水平百分之七十。
    工业生产量的高速度的增加和我国国民经济一切部门的发展，由于进行了广大的基本建设而获得保证。在过去实行战后五年计划的这段期间，重建或新建的工厂近六千座，规模较小的国营工厂和合作社工厂尚未计算在内。
    各州受到战争损害的工业，不仅已经完全恢复，而且已经大大扩展，添置了新的更为现代化的装备。
    恢复和发展重工业的任务已首先在胜利地完成着。
    钢铁生产超过战前百分之四十四
    煤产量已经增加了百分之五十七
    五年计划所规定的发展钢铁工业的目标已经超过。按照五年计划，一九五○年的钢铁生产要比一九四○年增加百分之三十五。在今年头十个月里，钢铁生产已超过了战前水平的百分之四十四——生铁百分之二十八，钢百分之四十八，辗金属百分之五十八。
    取得这些成果，是需要我们的金属工人和建筑工人做许多工作的。你们都知道，南方的钢铁工业在战时曾遭到彻底的破坏，而现在它们已在新的技术基础上全部重建起来，出产量也高过战前水平了。在东部各州，炼钢工业在继续扩展中。这些地区辗金属的产量目前已增加为战前的二倍半。
    按照五年计划所规定的有色金属生产目标，有色金属和稀有金属，如铝、锡、镍、铜、铅、锌、镁以及钨和钼等矿砂的生产，已有很大的增加。
    五年计划的采煤目标也超过了。
    按照五年计划，一九五○年的煤炭产量要比一九四○年增加百分之五十一。在今年头十个月当中，煤产量已比战前增加了百分之五十七，使苏联成为目前世界第二大产煤国。
    战时曾遭彻底破坏的顿巴斯煤矿工业，现在已经彻底修复。顿巴斯煤矿目前生产着比战前更多的煤斤，而且超过了五年计划所规定的产量。
    顿巴斯已再度成为国内最大的和最高度机械化的煤田。
    同样受到彻底破坏的莫斯科煤田，现在已生产了为战前的三倍的煤。
    与顿巴斯和莫斯科煤田的复兴同时，乌拉尔、库兹巴斯、卡拉干达和其他东部区域的煤矿工业，也有进一步的发展。东部各地区现在生产的煤为战前的二倍。五年计划中所规定的扩大贝考拉煤田——北部地区和列宁格勒的新的煤斤供应来源——的目标，现在已经超过。其他地区也正在发展着新煤田。
    石油产量增加百分之二十一
    发电量已增加百分之八十七
    我们的石油工业正在蓬勃地发展着。五年计划中所规定的产油目标已经超过。这个计划规定一九五○年石油产量应比战前多百分之十四。今年头十个月中，石油产量已比战前多百分之二十一。
    西乌克兰的梅哥勃和格罗斯尼的石油工业，在战争时期曾遭到彻底破坏。现在，它们已完全恢复并且在技术上重新装备起来了。
    东部新油区的重要性已大为增加，在古比雪夫州及土库曼、乌兹贝克和哈萨克等共和国，均有了突飞猛进的成绩。在鞑靼共和国，新的大油田已经建立起来。为了发展库页岛的石油生产，大规模的工程正在进行着。东部各州今天出产的石油占苏联石油总产量的百分之四十四，而在一九四○年仅占百分之十二。
    炼油工业在技术上已重新装备过。目前正生产着新型的高辛烷飞机用油和其他油类及滑润油。
    五年计划最后一年的发电量，应比战前多百分之七十；但事实上发电量已经增加了百分之八十七。在遭受战争破坏的区域里，许多电力厂曾受到彻底的破坏；今天，它们的电容量和发电量都超过了战前。
    机器制造业也在迅速地发展着，五年计划规定的机器、装备与工具的出产目标正在顺利地完成着。依照五年计划，一九五○年的机器出产将为战前的两倍。在今年的头十个月中，机器生产率已增为战前的二点二倍。钢铁工业装备的出产增加为五倍，蒸汽透平的出产增加为二倍半，具有强大动力的电动机的出产增加为五倍，石油工业装备的出产增加为三倍以上，挖掘机的出产增加为十三倍。
    苏联机器制造业人员依靠我们科学家的成就，在过去这几年中设计了并且制造了许多最新式的机器与装备。
    在五年计划的期间，工业装备操作的效率有很大的进步。例如鼓风炉操作的效率比战前提高了百分之二十五，熔钢炉操作的效率提高了百分之三十二。油井的开凿速度比战前增加百分之四十三。但是我们的先进工人及先进工厂与工作场的种种表现指明：还有巨大的潜在力量，可以更有效地使用装备而增大生产。
    由于成功地采用了新式装备，因而有可能大规模地继续进行我国国民经济的技术改装，并且提高消耗大量体力劳动的生产过程与沉重工作的机械化水平。与此同时，技术的进步和我们生产人员的技能的增加，以及工人、工程师和技术人员们的创造性建议，已使得劳动生产率大大提高。
    五年计划规定，一九五○年的工业中的劳动生产率，要比战前增加百分之三十六。实际上，我们的工业工人在一九五○年第三季的劳动生产率即比战前增加了百分之四十以上。在工业中，现正采取有效的措施，来节省原料、半制成品、燃料和动力，更有效地利用生产空间，和加速流动资金的周转。结果，政府规定的减少工业产品成本的计划正在完成和超额完成。
    在铁路的运转方面，像在工业生产中一样，也正在超过五年计划的目标。按照五年计划，一九五○年的铁道运货量，要比战前增加百分之二十八。实际上今年头十个月的铁道运货量即较战前水平增加了百分之四十以上。机车与货车的停车厂已经经过扩大和改建，生产电气机车和柴油机车的国内工业已经建立起来。
    农业生产获得了很大的进展
    谷物和棉花产量均大量增加
    农业中也有了很大的进展。今年，谷物总收获量为七十六亿普特，较一九四○年的收获量增加三亿普特。小麦的总收获量已超过一九四○年收获量三亿四千万普特。
    棉花的总收获量较一九四○年增加百分之四十以上。甜菜产量也有增加。今年我们的甜菜收获量至少要比一九四○年增加二千五百万生丁纳。
    一九四八年通过了一项关于种植防护林带、采用牧草作物轮种制及在苏联欧洲部分草原地带和森林草原带各州兴建池塘和蓄水池的计划，现在在执行这一计划中正获得胜利的进展。在这两年中已经种植了一百三十万公顷的树林，在这些州里的集体农场和国营农场的土地上，已修了成千的池塘和蓄水池。
    今年八月通过了一个重要的决定，规定在四百三十万公顷以上的地区中采用一种新的灌溉系统。这种新的灌溉系统规定利用临时灌溉渠代替那种妨碍在农业中采用现代机械技术的永久灌溉渠，这样将使我们有可能扩大灌溉土地的面积，并且大大地增加灌溉耕作的劳动生产率。
    今年党和政府的努力都转向解决我们农业的中心问题，及牲畜饲养的全面发展。现在正在成功地完成着发展集体农场和国营农场有出产的牲畜饲养的三年计划，各集体农场和国营农场都已大量地增加了牛羊畜群及其牲畜产品。
    在战争期间，我们的牲畜业曾遭到非常严重的损失。在全国最重要的农业区，在乌克兰、北高加索、白俄罗斯及中央黑土地带各州里，除了一小部分撤退到东部或由居民藏起来的牲畜以外，所有牲畜完全都被摧毁了。
    国内其他各地的牲畜饲养业，在战争期间也受了损害。但是尽管如此，但我们的生产牲畜饲养业现在不仅已完全达到了战前的水平，而且大大超过了战前的水平。集体农场中食用牛和乳用牛的头数，已较战前增加了百分之三十八；绵羊与山羊的头数增加了百分之六十五；马的头数增加了百分之五十五。集体农场和国营农场已经大大增加了纯种牲畜的头数。
    各集体农场和国营农场中，现正采取大规模的措施，建立设备完善的建筑，以饲养牲畜，并建立充分的饲料供应：现正施行特别饲料作物的轮种，推广牧草的种植，扩充饲料及根类作物的栽培，并开始推行新的多产饲料作物苏丹蜀黍等的栽培。
    谷类作物和工业作物生产，以及牲畜饲养业产量的增加，为我们的轻工业和食品工业的进一步扩大创造了坚固的原料基础。
    党和政府给予了集体农场，国营农场及机器与拖拉机站以宝贵的帮助。供应农业方面的各种机器，也正在增加。我国的拖拉机及农业机器工厂在战时都曾遭受破坏，但现在已完全重建起来，这些工厂连同新建立的工厂，今年供应农业的各种机器都比一九四○年为多，计：拖拉机（平均以每部十五匹马力计）为一九四○年的四倍，联合收割机三·八倍，拖拉机曳引犁四倍，拖拉机曳引播种机六倍，拖拉机曳引耕耘机三倍。
    我们的化学工业对农业供应着越来越多的无机物肥料。今年我们的农业所得到的磷、钾、氮肥料差不多比一九四○年增加一倍。
    以现代化机器装备起来的大规模集体农业的经营是需要集体耕作经济、农业技术，与农业机械化的原理等各方面的知识的。精干的农业组织家、经理与专家从集体农民的队伍中涌现出来。然而，我们并不能因此而满足，所以，党与政府认为必须进一步加强我们的集体农场，把农业科学和先进的实际经验所达到的最新的成就应用于集体农场与机器和拖拉机站。
    国民收入超过五年计划原定水平
    劳动人民的生活标准已日益提高
    伴同国民经济的进展而来的是国民收入的增加，与我们人民的生活水平和文化水平的不断提高。
    在资本主义国家，工人所创造的国民收入绝大部分为剥削阶级据为己有。而在苏维埃社会主义的经济制度之下，国民收入则归于劳动人民。其分配的方法，不是为了扩大剥削阶级的财富，而是为了工人、农民与知识分子的物质条件的有系统的改善与社会主义生产的扩大。因此，苏维埃国家国民收入的增长，即是劳动群众日益上升的生活水平的最丰富最生动的指标。
    根据五年计划，一九五○年的国民收入将比战前增加百分之三十八。可是，早在一九四九年苏联的国民收入实际上就已达到这个水平了，而在一九五○年，国民收入如以物价计算就比战前增加了百分之六十以上，即大大地超过了五年计划原定的水平。
    大家都知道，苏联政府曾实行过货币改革，连续降低物价，一九五○年第三次减低了日常用品的零售价格。这就进一步加强了苏联的卢布并提高了它的购买力。还在一九四九年时，平均工资与薪金（以物价计）即比战前增加了百分之二十四。农民的收入相应地提高了百分之三十。今年，我们又看到了实际工资与薪金及农民收入的继续增加。
    谁都知道，在我们国家中没有失业。在国民经济中，就业的人数正在继续不断地增加着，现在已比战前增加了百分之二十二。
    劳动人民生活标准的提高，反映在人民购买力的增加和贸易额的增长上。与战前相较，今年我们除地方供应外，通过国营商店和合作商店供给人民的货物销售量是：肉类与肉制品增加了百分之三十五，鱼类增加了百分之五十三，牛油和其他油脂类增加百分之六十，食糖和糖果类增加百分之三十，棉织品、羊毛、丝和亚麻类纺织品增加百分之三十八，鞋类增加百分之三十五，袜类增加百分之三十七，肥皂类增加百分之三十一。
    人民消费量比较战前大为提高。
    党和政府认为头等重要的事情是把我国的房屋建筑增加到最大限度。特别是帮助工人、农民、和知识分子建筑他们自己的家园。在过去实行五年计划的四年和十个月里，重建或新建的住宅面积，总计约达九千万平方公尺。在乡村地区重建或新建的房屋已超过二百五十万幢。
    这些数字说明了我国房屋建筑的规模是多么大。但是这些建筑计划并不是所有地方都充分完成了的。在城镇和乡村，现在房屋的建设仍然缓慢而且费用太昂贵。
    政府用巨款举办社会与文化事业
    学校与学生数目较战前大为增加
    政府支用巨额的款项来举办社会与文化服务。自战争结束以来，我国已经新建或重建了成千的新学校、图书馆和幼稚园，以及大量的医院、疗养院、休养所、俱乐部、剧院和电影院。
    现在小学、七年制学校、中学、技术学校和其他中等学校就学的学生共达三千七百万人。大学与专科学校的学生共一百二十三万人，比战前多四十万人。
    苏联的文学和艺术正在不断发展中。它们在我国是为人民利益服务的，并且是对苏维埃公民进行共产主义教育的重要工具。
    我们科学研究机构的数目增加了。我们已经采取了重要的新步骤，来完成斯大林同志交给苏联科学家的任务——“在最近的将来不但要赶上外国科学的成就，而且要超过它们。”我们的科学家除已发现原子能的秘密外，还有了很多其他重要的著作与发现，这些著作与发现帮助了技术的进步与我们国民经济计划的完成与超过。
    今年举行的关于语言学与生理学上的各种问题的公开讨论，帮助了推进我们苏维埃科学的发展。
    斯大林同志对语言学讨论所作的贡献是具有特别的价值的。首先斯大林同志的贡献在这门科学里带来了一个急剧的转变。斯大林同志证明：没有不同意见的论战、没有自由的批评、不以新的公式与结论代替那些陈旧的公式与结论，科学便不能发展昌盛。这样就在苏联一切科学思想的领域里开拓了解决我们国家所面临的各种新问题的宽阔大道。
    在谈到我们在经济文化方面的成就时，不能不同时也提到我们光荣的武装部队——我们的陆军、空军与海军。他们光荣地执行着他们的军事职责，可靠地捍卫了我们祖国的和平与安全。
    政府决定进行共产主义建设工程
    建造最大的水电站与开凿大运河
    斯大林同志教导我们说：共产主义计划经济是以工业与农业方面的技术上的最高成就为基础的。因此，我们必须进一步推进我们苏维埃的经济，把一切经济部门的技术装备提高到更高的水平，并进一步发展我国的生产力。
    在为实现苏维埃人民所面临的这些任务而作的斗争中，政府在伏尔加河建造古比雪夫与斯大林格勒水电站、开凿自阿姆河到克拉斯诺伏斯克的土库曼大运河、在第聂伯河建造卡霍夫卡水电站与南乌克兰运河及北克里米亚运河等的决议，是具有极大重要意义的。这些工程就其规模、技术上的独创性，及其完成的期限来说，确是真正的共产主义的建设工程。每个工程都包括建设动力站、水闸、供水渠、蓄水池与灌溉系统。每一工程都是复杂工程的结合。这种性质的工作只有在社会主义计划经济之下的我国才有可能实现。
    四个新水电站的总发电能力将达四百万千瓦在水位正常的年份可发二百二十亿千瓦时的电，这个数目比一九一三年沙皇俄国的全部电力站所发的总电流多十倍以上。
    古比雪夫和斯大林格勒两个水力发电站，将供应莫斯科所需的一切电力，并使伏尔加河地区和中央黑土地带的经济开发，得以更迅速地完成。同时土库曼大运河及卡霍夫卡两处的水力发电站，即足以加速土库曼的里海地区和第聂伯河下游地区的经济发展。有了这些水力发电站，我国就能够设立新的工厂，并在现有的工厂中添置最新式的设备。
    由于伏尔加，南乌克兰，克里米亚北部各地区以及里海及中央亚细亚一带的沙漠和半沙漠地区的获得灌溉，我国小麦，稻米，棉花及其他工业作物的产量，即将增加数百万普特。在各灌溉地区，牲畜饲养业也要大事扩展。新设水力发电厂所生产的电力，将在工业和农业中广泛使用。
    政府所作关于在伏尔加河，阿姆河和第聂伯河上建设这些工厂的决定，在我国各地受到了热烈的拥护。我国许多工厂中的工人，都提出保证要迅速而完善地完成新建设计划的订货。苏联的科学家，工程师和专门技术人员们都正在尽自己的创造力以谋解决新建设计划中的种种技术问题。伏尔加、土库曼、乌克兰和克里米亚的男女集体农民们，正在保证贡献他们个人的劳动，以便加速完成建筑工程。
    加强干部的思想与理论的教育
    展开有系统的批评与自我批评
    随着苏维埃社会的发展，我们干部在思想上和理论上的深邃修养已变得日益重要。由社会主义到共产主义的过渡，使我们有必要把一切思想教育工作提高到更高的水平，并且进一步改进对劳动人民的共产主义教育工作。
    不彻底根除我们人民心中的资本主义残余，共产主义就不能建立起来。因此，我们必须加紧斗争，反对对待工作和社会主义财产、对待遵守国家利益的非共产主义态度的各种表现。我们必须根本地消除资产阶级在科学、文学与艺术方面的影响，不屈不挠地进行工作，使我们在各个领域中的专门人材的马列主义教育工作臻于完善，并帮助他们掌握社会发展规律的科学。
    我们的党要求我们不满足于既有的成就，不因我们的成绩沾沾自喜。不注意我们工作的缺点，不采取措施消除它们，就有愧为苏维埃人民。
    例如：像违反关于有义务来完成国家计划的法律这样一种不可容忍的事情，我们是不能不过问的。在若干工业部门中，有些工厂一贯地不能完成分配给它们的任务。这些工业部门中的负责人自己安慰自己，认为不能完成任务的工厂的不好的工作成绩，是可以从先进工厂的超计划完成任务中得到补偿的。
    这是对完成国家计划的一种不正确的非苏维埃的态度。这种忽视某些工厂成绩不好，并用其他工厂成绩好来补偿的行为，和苏维埃型的企业管理毫无相同之处。这种办法和社会主义企业的经理人员是不相称的。只有资产阶级的经营家才能这样想这样做。国家计划就是法律。每一个工厂都负有必须完成任务的职责。这个要求不仅适用于工业的经理人员，而且也适用于我们社会主义经济的其他一切部门。
    指出基本建设领域内的严重缺点，也具有同样重要的意义。斯大林同志曾经唤起我们注意这些缺点。虽然一方面由于工业生产的发展，生产成本已经降低，从而使物价得以减低，苏维埃卢布得以加强，但是同时，尽管基本建设工作有着巨大的扩展，建筑成本却并没有下降，而仍然是过份的高昂。
    在设计工程计划时，容许了过多不必要的东西，这就增加了建设的费用。由于在计划基本建设工程中存在着的严重缺点，物资和资金分散到过多的工程计划上，结果使得建设拖得太久，新的生产设备的开工因而延迟了，未完工的建设工程数量增加了。鉴于我们目前的基本建设工程，具有庞大的规模，这个问题便具有巨大的国家重要性了。
    我们的建筑组织的指导者，必须去掉那种不完成政府所规定的关于减低建筑费用的目标的习惯，他们必须大大提高建设的速度，改进他们的工作方法，并且不再落后于我们的国民经济的其他部门。
    消除我们工作中的缺点的一个可靠而又久经考验的工具，便是布尔什维主义的批评与自我批评。党教导我们：批评与自我批评是社会主义社会的推动力之一，它有效地帮助去掉旧的和过时的东西，并为新的、先进的和进步的东西廓清道路。因此一定不要零星地使用批评与自我批评，而是要有系统地使用批评与自我批评。批评与自我批评必须是改进我们工作的一个经常起作用的工具。
    消除政治教育中的缺点和我们的经济工作和文化工作中的缺点，将使我们能够发现发展社会主义生产的新的潜力，因而加快我们走向共产主义的速度。
    （二）苏联和巩固世界和平的斗争
    从事于经济发展工作的苏联，正在不屈不挠地努力争取所有各国人民之间的和平、友好与合作。
    在争取国际和平与友好的斗争中，与苏联并肩站在一起的，有各人民民主国家——阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、波兰和罗马尼亚。
    伟大的中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导之下，正在为和平事业而积极奋斗。
    德意志民主共和国坚定地站在和平阵营之中。
    朝鲜人民正在为了和平和民族的自由与独立而进行解放战争。
    所有这些国家的人民便是和平、社会主义与民主的阵营。
  苏联政府采取实际的步骤  增进国际间的和平与合作
    斯大林同志曾经一再说过，经济制度与思想意识的差异，并不排除苏联与资本主义国家，特别是苏联与美国之间的合作与正常关系。
    斯大林同志曾经说：“合作并不需要各国人民具有类似的制度。每个人必须尊重人民所赞同的制度。”
    同时，斯大林同志指出：“合作的可能性与合作的希望之间，必须划分清楚。合作的可能性经常是存在着的，然而却不一定经常都有合作的意愿。”至于苏联，举世皆知苏联政府已经作了许多努力，采取了实际的步骤，以增进国际间的和平与合作。
    社会主义和民主阵营和平阵营，受到以美国统治集团为首的，奉行着发动另一次战争的政策——强国统治弱国的政策的帝国主义阵营的反对。
    在第二次世界大战以前，美帝国主义者在世界市场上的主要竞争者，是德国和日本。因为这些国家在大战中被击败了，美帝国主义者正在努力利用新的形势，以夺取原料的来源和市场。但是，这并不是他们唯一的目标。美帝国主义者相信：新的第三次大战一定会引起苏联和人民民主国家的垮台，一定可以镇压在其他一切国家的劳工运动，和民族解放运动，一定可以建立美帝国主义者的世界霸权。帝国主义阵营便是为了这些目的而加紧军备竞赛，扩大军费，增加其武装部队的力量，破坏国内残存的民主自由、迫害进步组织。美帝国主义者希望利用他们的附庸国家的军队作为达到这些目的的炮灰。曾一度奉行独立外交政策的英、法统治集团，目前在所有的重大国际问题上，却损害他们自己的民族利益，而卑躬屈节地服从美帝国主义者的命令。
    苏联主张和平解决朝鲜问题
    美国侵略者拒绝了这个建议
    从朝鲜事件一开始时，苏联即主张应以和平的方法来解决冲突。为了这个目的，苏联政府曾提议：朝鲜战争应立即停止，所有的外国军队应同时自朝鲜撤退，这样，使朝鲜人民有可能不须外国的干涉而自行解决他们国内的事情。
    但是，从事公开侵略的美国政府拒绝了一切关于和平解决朝鲜问题的建议。这是对一切国家人民的客观教训，它显示了谁主张和平及谁主张另一次战争。
    美国军事司令部在对爱好自由的朝鲜人民的战争中遭受了挫折及严重的失败之后，美国就集合了他们在远东的几乎一切可用的武装部队投入了朝鲜战争。美国不是单单靠他们自己的部队，而且征用了英国及其他国家的军队参加作战。只是靠了这些数倍于朝鲜人民军的大量部队的帮助，干涉者才取得了某些军事胜利。
    朝鲜人民在取得巨大军事胜利之后，现在正经历着一个军事挫折的时期，但这些挫折并未挫折他们的战斗决心。
    每次战争中都会有挫折的。我们苏维埃国家在外国武装干涉及内战时期，也经历过一个非常困难的时期。但干涉者终于被击败并被赶出去了。
    朝鲜人民由于他们对美国干涉者进行了英勇的斗争，已赢得了世界一切爱好和平的人民的同情，朝鲜已成为许多国家的解放运动的旗帜。
  苏联坚主早缔对德对日和约  美英违犯对德日问题的义务
    在战胜法西斯德国及帝国主义日本之后，各大国体现了经受过战争恐怖的各国人民的意志，建立了一致同意的国际关系的制度，这个制度保证了各国的和平与安全。这个制度的基础就是波茨坦协定以及联合国宪章。但是美英帝国主义者很久以来就一直在努力破坏这个国际合作的制度。美英帝国主义者绕过并直接违犯联合国宪章而组成了侵略性的北大西洋联盟，并正在组织其他军事侵略集团。
    英美的统治者正在阻挠缔结对德和约，并力图尽可能久地延长对西德的占领。美英法三外长本年九月在纽约的会议中，决定在西德重建德国陆军，采取实际措施使西德重新军事化，并为了它们自己的利益使用德国的人力及物质资源，而不顾德国人民的民族利益。
    美，英，法三国政府违背波茨坦协定的原则而奉行的分裂德国的政策，割断了德国东西两区之间的正常经济联系，而专门发展西德的与战争生产有关的工业部门。
    与此截然不同的是苏联政府的政策。它坚持实行波茨坦协定，该协定规定建立一个统一、独立、爱好和平的民主德国。苏联政府要求迅速缔结对德和约、撤退占领军、建立一个全德国的政府的建议，是尽人皆知的事。这些建议在最近发表的苏联、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国八国外长的宣言中又再度提出。
    苏联政府也坚主实行波茨坦宣言，那就是：迅速缔结对日和约，撤退驻日本的占领军，并消除日本军国主义复活的威胁。
    相反的，美国的目的是要延长对日本的占领，并把它变成一个基地，以便完成其在远东的侵略计划。美国利用它作为一个占领国的地位，并违反业经同意的关于废除日本军事化以及日本民主化的决定，正在日本重建海军基地，重建日本的军队，迫害民主团体并协助日本军阀重握权力。
    美国和英国政府就是这样违犯它们在德国和日本问题上所承担的义务，阻挠了所有国家的人民所异常关怀的战后和约的订立。
    苏联支持一切加强联合国的措施
    美国却把它变成掩盖侵略的机关
    苏联政府致力于和平及国际合作，支持一切加强联合国的措施，因为联合国的使命就是要成为维持和平与国际安全的有效工具。
    斯大林同志说：“这个国际组织的力量，在于它是以各国平等的原则为基础，而不是以某些国家统治另一些国家的原则为基础的。假若联合国组织将来也能保持平等的原则，那么它无疑在保证普遍和平与安全上就会起伟大的积极作用”。
    英美集团的代表有系统地拒绝了苏联所提出的加强联合国的建议。不仅如此，美国政府还正在把这个国际组织变为纯粹美国国务院的附属物，变为掩盖美国侵略计划的机关。这样，美国政府已经表现了它并不想寻觅国际合作的方法，并不尊重其他国家的主权权利，而是想发动另一次战争。
    帝国主义者尽极大的努力来歪曲苏联的和平政策，说这种政策是宣传，是企图迷惑别人的。但是，苏联政府一再提出旨在制止新战争的爆发以及扩大国际合作的建议，还有什么比这更明确、更清楚的吗？苏联政府忠诚地执行为争取和平而斗争的政策，在这次联合国第五届大会上建议通过《制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全宣言》案。在这个宣言中，苏联政府再度建议谴责并禁止新战争宣传，禁止以原子弹作为侵略及大规模屠杀的武器；建立严格的国际管制，以使禁令得以严格地无条件地付诸实施；五强缔结加强和平的公约，并在一年以内将军备裁减三分之一，今后并继续加以裁减。
    苏联人民绝不会被威胁吓倒
    必要时将拿起武器保护自己
    接受苏联政府的这些和平建议，从而试验苏联建立的真挚性，有什么比这更简单的吗？但是在联合国中控制了唯命是听的多数的战争贩子们，却宁愿拒绝苏联的建议。他们拒绝苏联建议的原因，是因为苏联建议会使战争贩子们的努力和他们的侵略计划成为画饼。不仅如此，这些先生们还正在对苏联采取威胁的手段。
    是这些大人先生们应该明白的时候了。应该明白苏联人民并不是神经衰弱的人，不是威胁所能吓倒的人。过去的历史证明：我们的和平政策不是软弱的表示。是时候了，这些先生们应该明白我国人民是能够保护他们自己，保护他们国家的利益，在必要时，还要拿起武器来保护它。
    帝国主义者企图硬说他们是与共产主义作战，以此来掩饰他们的侵略政策。这种诡计并不是新的。希特勒及其同谋犯也曾经企图侈谈共产主义的威胁，以此来辩解他们的侵略政策。每个人都知道希特勒分子的这些虚伪阴谋是如何终场的。英美集团的战争贩子显然是很羡慕希特勒的桂冠。
    然而，今日的人民已不能这样容易受骗了。
    共产主义与劳动人民是不可分割的，正如不可能毁灭人民一样，也不可能毁灭共产主义。正是由于人民在资本主义社会中所处的地位，使人民成为帝国主义的不能调和的敌人，资本主义使人民经受种种痛苦，并在许多掠夺战争的战场上遭受大规模的屠杀。
    全世界和平运动日益强大扩展
    各国人民的正义事业必获胜利
    人民日益清楚地知道：战争贩子们正试图把他们投入的深渊是如何可怕。
    战争的日益增长的威胁，增加了各个人民制止战争的决心。全世界各地争取和平的有组织的运动，正在日益壮大与强大的扩展。
    各国人民现在不仅为确保禁止原子武器，而且也为普遍裁减各种军备、禁止各种各样的战争宣传、反对武装侵略与外来的干预各国人民内政的行为而斗争。
    苏联人民主张和平并坚决维护和平的事业。苏联最高苏维埃在今年六月代表人民的意志，表示支持世界保卫和平大会常设委员会的斯德哥尔摩宣言。有一亿一千五百余万的苏联公民——我国全体成年人——已在这个宣言上签了名，从而表达了他们热爱和平的意愿，和他们为持久和平而斗争的决心。在其他国家内也有数千百万人民起来为争取和平而斗争。拥护斯德哥尔摩宣言，并在宣言上签名的人，在中国已有二亿零四百万，在波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利和阿尔巴尼亚有五千余万，在日本、朝鲜、英国、阿根廷及其他国家有五千万，在德国有二千万，在法国有一千五百万，在意大利有一千六百万，在美国有二百五十万。今天总共已有五亿人左右在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。对于战争贩子来说，这是一支不可轻侮的力量，是一个严重的警告。
    正为和平而斗争的各国人民，深信他们的正义的事业必将获得胜利。他们必将挫败战争贩子的计划。
    同志们！我国在战后时期内所获得的种种巨大的成就都是苏联人民的英雄劳动、以及共产党——列宁和斯大林的党的正确政策的成果。
    在我们国家与社会生活的各部门中，都表现出了党的组织和领导作用。战争结束后，党即把苏维埃人民的一切努力都转向复兴我国的经济、促进我们国家的进步的工作中。在党的号召下，全国各地展开了提前完成五年计划的社会主义竞赛。党保证了苏联人民的文化与物质的进步。
    在党的旗帜下，苏维埃社会的精神上与政治上的团结已更加坚强，各族人民的斯大林友好发展了并加强了。在经济与文化各部门的发展中，无数新干部接受了党的教育，以马克思列宁主义的科学武装了起来。
    我们共产党的活动已证明了党把人民的利益看得高于一切，并且有能力为人民的利益进行斗争。由于党服务于国家与人民的利益，它已获得苏维埃公民的热爱和充分的信任。
    苏联的力量的泉源就在这里。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命的不可战胜的旗帜万岁！
    强大的苏维埃人民万岁！
    我们的光荣的共产党万岁！
    全世界的和平万岁！
