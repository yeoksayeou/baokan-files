　　The developments of the past six months have fully proven the assessment of the international situation made by our party's 12th Central Committee Plenary Session: "Peace hangs by a thread."

　　The intervention of the American armed forces in Korea and Taiwan shows that the imperialist warmongers have moved from preparing for aggression to openly invading the people of various countries. The US imperialists have been waging their predatory colonial war against Korea, a small country, for three months now, and Korea is fighting heroically for freedom, unity, and national independence.

　　The US imperialists are trying to use despicable slanders and propaganda campaigns to make the world believe that they are so-called warriors defending justice and civilization. As if anyone could force the people of all countries to forget that the Korean people are in their own homes! The aggressors are the Americans, who are bathing a small country thousands of miles away from the United States, across the Pacific Ocean, in blood. The whole world is indignant when it hears how American planes are systematically razing Seoul and other Korean cities to the ground, burning villages, and wiping out civilians: women, children, and the elderly, using terror bombing methods.

　　The US government also launched an open aggression against China, attempting to seize China's Taiwan. The Americans hope to keep a base for Chiang Kai-shek, who was expelled by the Chinese people. They want to turn Taiwan into a springboard in the Pacific. American planes have already bombed villages in Northeast China, but the United Nations organization still refuses to consider the accusations of the government of the People's Republic of China.

　　The dispatch of a US military mission to Indochina fully exposes the true nature of the "dirty war" that has been waged against the Vietnamese people for four years.

　　American capitalists take the leading position in the imperialist camp against the struggle of the Asian people. These Asian countries have liberated themselves from colonial exploitation or are fighting for their independence. The imperialists are not reconciled to the independence of the Asian countries. They want to tightly bind the people of these countries or enslave them again. Isn't it a good proof that the governments of Britain, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium—all colonial owners—are the first to follow the American government, which is responsible for the aggression against Korea and China? Moreover, isn't it under the example and order of the United States that these countries' governments are forcing the United Nations to go bankrupt and lose its prestige?

　　The wars launched by the imperialists in Korea and Vietnam can only deepen the crisis of the colonial system. This war is causing the further shrinking of the imperialist bases. The struggle of the people of Asian and African countries for independence is an effective contribution to the common struggle for peace. This has been proven by the recent declarations of Moroccan and Tunisian nationalist groups, who refused to participate in the war against the Soviet Union that the imperialists are preparing. In this way, in the struggle for peace, the people of the suzerain states, led by the working class, and the people of the colonies and semi-colonies are realizing fighting solidarity, which will guarantee the victory of their common cause—the cause of freedom and peace, and the cause of independence for all nations.

　　The American aggression in Korea is an integral part of the overall plan of the US imperialists to prepare for a war against China and the Soviet Union. The United States hopes to add new links to the vast and almost continuous network of air and naval bases and springboards that it intends to use to wage war against the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries. This explains why there is an aggressive Atlantic Treaty, why there were recent decisions by the "Three" (US, British, and French Foreign Ministers—editor) and "Twelve" (representatives of the North Atlantic Treaty member states—editor) meetings regarding the rearmament of Germany, and why General Marshall was appointed as the US Secretary of Defense.

　　We have said repeatedly that the Marshall Plan is a war plan. Today, no one doubts this anymore. In the socio-economic field, the consequences of this plan have proven disastrous for Marshallized countries. In our country's case, the Marshall Plan has halted recovery and has caused production to decline, the bankruptcy of many sectors of the national economy (especially the aircraft industry), agricultural recession, stagnation of trade, wages that cannot make ends meet, unemployment, a threefold increase in prices, heavy taxes, government deficits, inflation, and a decreasing possibility of stabilizing the value of the franc, and so on.

　　American capitalists have deprived our country of its economic and political independence. Despite popular resistance, France is being dragged down the road of adventure and war. American capitalists and their despicable lackeys are trying to turn the French people against their friends and allies—the Soviet Union. They are forcing our country to abandon the security guarantees and reparations that our country has the right to demand from Germany. They hope to force France, which has not yet fully recovered since the war, to agree to rearm West Germany, which has already been included in the aggressive system of the Atlantic Treaty.

　　Today, when cruel reality tears through the veil of lies and illusions, the Marshall Plan has revealed its true colors, proving to be a reactionary plan, a plan of poverty and war. It was predictable that this plan would merge with the Atlantic Treaty. It is leading to an abominable alliance between France and Germany for a criminal war against the Soviet Union.

　　American masters are issuing orders to all Marshallized countries to extend the term of military service, intending to launch an aggression against the Soviet Union. In France, as a start, the term of military service has been extended to eighteen months. Young soldiers who have already completed their military service will be forced to serve for another three months. Extending the term of military service to eighteen months is a measure aimed at launching a war. This will enable the government to send young soldiers in service to Africa and Asia to conduct predatory wars against the colonial peoples. American masters hope to get cannon fodder for their anti-Soviet war in Marshallized countries by extending the term of military service.

　　In order to force the people to agree to extend the term of military service to eighteen months, the enemies of the people argue that the Soviet Union has a powerful army. This is not a very large army compared to the Soviet Union's population and territory. Fortunately, this army proved powerful enough to destroy the Hitlerite bandits and save France and Europe from enslavement. It must maintain its strength in order to repel any new aggression by capitalist countries if necessary. At a time when the whole world is filled with imperialist hysterical cries demanding a "preemptive" war against socialist countries and peace, the Soviet Union cannot relax its vigilance and can only express constant concern for strengthening its military strength.

　　People in pro-American parties want to make the French people believe that the Soviet Union is undermining peace and threatening our country. But the French people are unwilling to be deceived. They have not forgotten, and will never forget, the benefits they received from the heroes who defended Stalingrad, from the Soviet soldiers, and from their beloved and respected leader—the great Stalin. The people of France do not want to, and will not, fight against the Soviet Union.

　　All honest people know that the various peoples of the Soviet Union are fully committed to fulfilling their great historical task—completing the construction of socialism and gradually transitioning to a communist society, in which the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" (Marx) will be realized. Having completed the reconstruction of the areas destroyed by the Hitlerite bandits—an area four times the size of France—the various peoples of the Soviet Union have begun the great work of transforming nature, changing the climate and topography of vast lands, and creating better conditions for people to live and work. Forest belts are being built on millions and millions of acres of land. Huge dams and powerful hydroelectric power stations are being built. In addition, canals are being dug to turn dry grasslands and deserts into fertile fields.

　　Everyone still remembers what Vyshinsky said at the recent session of the United Nations General Assembly: "In the Soviet Union, we do not use atomic energy to stockpile atomic bombs, although I am sure that if atomic bombs are unfortunately needed, there will be as many as needed. We want to use atomic energy to serve the great task of peaceful construction, so as to flatten mountains, change river courses, irrigate deserts, and open up new roads in uninhabited areas."

　　French people who are not blinded by prejudice and hatred towards the Soviet Union—and they are in the vast majority—know that the Soviet Union has unflinchingly pursued, and will continue to pursue, a policy of peace, based on the possibility of long-term coexistence between the two systems of capitalism and socialism.

　　The Soviet Union does not interfere in the affairs of other countries. It has never threatened, and does not threaten, any nation. In fact, there is no conflict of national interests between France and the Soviet Union. In fact, both France and the Soviet Union are concerned about making it impossible for the threat of German imperialism to re-emerge. In fact, the Soviet Union has never asked our country for territory, naval or air bases, or any other military, economic, or political demands.

　　Since this is the case, we say that the restoration of anti-Soviet and anti-communist policies is because the bourgeoisie and their representatives in the government first calculate their selfish interests and put the considerations of their class first, how else could there be any other explanation?

　　They slander and attack the Soviet Union because the existence of the Soviet Union as a socialist country itself revolutionizes the world, because it inspires the oppressed masses with confidence in inevitable and necessary liberation, and also because the Soviet Union is a bulwark of peace and democracy, and a fighter for the independence of all nations.

　　This explains the class roots of the reactionary policies of creating poverty and war pursued by the capitalists and their servants—the right-wing socialist leaders. They are preparing an anti-Soviet war, trying to eliminate the hope of liberation among the proletariat, tightly binding the colonial peoples, and reversing the wheels of history. They understand that they are doomed to perish and are terrified of the rising forces, the future forces that are moving forward to take their place.

　　But all the means used by the ruling class to maintain its shaken rule can only aggravate the contradictions of this disintegrating society, the contradictions of decaying capitalism. The barbaric repression of the working class and peace fighters, the fascization of Western "democracies"—all this should be seen as a means of preparing for war and as proof of the madness of the bourgeoisie's leading groups.

　　In order to prevent the struggle of the masses against the policies of war and impoverishment, the imperialists resort to terrorism and assassination, just as Hitler and Mussolini did yesterday and as Franco and Tito are doing today. They have attempted to assassinate the leader of the Italian working people, Togliatti, and the secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, Tokuda Kyuichi. They assassinated the chairman of the Belgian Communist Party, one of the most prestigious figures in the international working-class movement, our comrade Lahaut.

　　The United States is an example. A few days ago, a communist was assassinated in his own home because he had received an illegal deportation order and failed to leave the city quickly! Many communist workers have been killed there! Many black people have been lynched or openly killed under various pretexts! The number is countless!

　　The United States can also serve as an example of illegal suppression of labor leaders. The leaders of our brother party—the Communist Party of the United States—have been sentenced to five years in prison simply because they promote communist ideas. In the United States, progressive writers such as Fast and Maltz, and prominent progressive figures in the film industry have been thrown into jail. In the United States, the so-called Committee on Un-American Activities is really running amok; it is such an organization that it has turned informing and espionage into a national disaster; coincidentally, the "honest" chairman of this committee was recently convicted of fraud. In the United States, a fascist law has just been enacted to force Communist Party members to register with the police, and they must be sent to concentration camps in the event of war or "emergency."

　　The United States is ordering the governments of Marshallized countries to take extraordinary measures against communists. And the French "Socialist" ministers, led by Moch, have become the initiators of France's new militarization laws. Moch and his ilk have become advocates of taking extraordinary measures against communists who are loyal to the working class and its traditional spirit of fighting for peace.

　　Not long ago, the outstanding scientist, the pride of France, our friend Joliot-Curie was removed from the position of High Commissioner for Atomic Energy under the orders of the United States. Professor Daquesne was also removed from his leadership position in this scientific research institution. The French government is going to strike another blow—to remove all communists from civil service. In France, they are already talking about declaring the French Communist Party illegal. Daladier, whose hands are stained with the blood of innocent victims, dares to demand that the Communist Party be banned! He is not satisfied with preparing for Hitler's aggression and causing all the disasters that France suffered, such as taking illegal measures against communists and letting Nazi agents run amok in France.

　　All republicans realize that anti-communist criminal laws and orders are a threat to all the people: after persecuting communists, the enemies of the people begin to persecute socialists, republicans, and defenders of democracy who refuse to obey fascist dictatorships.

　　In France, famous workers and peace defenders are now subjected to barbaric repression, while collaborationists and traitors are released; Pleven threatens patriots while announcing amnesty for traitors. The current rulers of France illegally arrest and deport labor exiles, including Spanish anti-fascists, while strengthening their ties with Franco, who is a possible ally in the event of an anti-Soviet war. The working people of Algiers in France are persecuted, their newspapers are banned, while the fascist Anders gang and Tito's spies can run rampant.

　　Attacks on activists and raids on workers' residences and democratic organizations are becoming more and more frequent, and a despicable police apparatus of informing and espionage is being established. Moch is organizing fascist-type guard forces. These reserve soldiers are drawn from the police and volunteers, and in peacetime, these forces have tripled the police strength in order to deal with the working-class struggle. It is not difficult to see what these auxiliary police forces will look like: the children of capitalists, rich peasants, former colonists, bandits, and other dregs. In short, it is a question of establishing a new fascist militia—a new French volunteer corps. The working class and all republicans must protest vigorously against this action together. They must fight against the action of openly and legally establishing fascist gangs. This is the lesson we learned in the case of February 1934, when these attempts were decisively repulsed by the joint action of the working class.

　　In Italy, Gasperi also proposed a plan for a black shirt organization. The same preparations are being made in Belgium. We have to point out the consistent nature of the anti-labor fascist measures advocated in Italy, Belgium, and France.

　　Finally, for future elections, a fraudulent election law is being prepared. This election law is openly praised as a tool to deprive the five million French men and women who voted for our party of their representatives in the National Assembly.

　　Assassinations, assassination attempts, terror, police repression, extraordinary measures, declaring the people's loyal defenders illegal—all these are new steps towards fascization. The enemies of the people are preparing the rear defense line for the anti-Soviet war. Comrade Stalin pointed out at the 17th Congress of the Bolshevik Party in 1934 that fascism must be considered a sign of the bourgeoisie's weakness, not a sign of the bourgeoisie's strength. The working class and all fighters for peace and freedom have acquitted the comrades in the Rhône department, and they will also find ways to achieve other victories. They will not fail to show the necessary vigilance and determination to protect their activists and organizations and force fascism and war to retreat.

　　A striking feature of the situation in France and the rest of the world is the steady growth of the forces of peace, the increasingly clear understanding of the scale of the danger threatening them by the broad masses, and the firm determination to unite all people and countries who want freedom and peace and take resolute action against the warmongers to avoid danger.

　　The Stockholm Appeal and the signature campaign are achieving preliminary and significant success. The US imperialists dare not use atomic bombs against the Korean people, although they want to do so, and although despicable beasts demand that they do so. As expected, the Stockholm signature campaign has inspired the struggle for peace. The working class continues to conduct mass political struggles against the manufacture and transportation of war materials, with dockworkers in the forefront.

　　The struggle for immediate demands has also intensified significantly. Since prices have risen on average twice as much as in 1947, workers cannot be satisfied with the meager wages that Pleven and Mollet promised them.

　　In the struggle to raise wages, despite the fierce opposition of the leaders of "Workers' Force"—the lackeys of US imperialism—there is still concerted action between the members and organizations of the General Confederation of Labor, the French Confederation of Christian Workers, and "Workers' Force." It is now impossible to count all the instances of concerted action by working people in various industries in various provinces. This guarantees the inevitable victory of the working people in the struggle for higher wages. The significance of this struggle for bread, which is also a struggle for peace, cannot be overestimated. The militant slogans of defending peace and opposing the extension of military service to eighteen months are often raised with the unanimous agreement of the workers, as is the case in many enterprises in the Paris region. Even if the common struggle is only carried out under the slogan of demanding higher wages, it is indeed a contribution to the struggle for peace. In fact, it means that the working people refuse to pay the costs of the war policy implemented by the rulers. It means that the working people are unwilling to make the sacrifices required of them in order to continue the war against the Vietnamese people and to prepare for anti-Soviet aggression.

　　The responsibility of the communists lies in carefully assessing the situation in the enterprises where they work, and striving to correctly express the emotions of the working people, helping the trade unions to formulate legitimate demands, and standing at the forefront of the common struggle to meet these demands.

　　This naturally also applies to the struggle to achieve the immediate demands put forward by working people in various industries who are suffering from the war policies of the enemies of the people. This refers to the demands of civil servants, especially low-paid employees whose salaries cannot keep up with the higher cost of living, veterans, members of the resistance movement, disabled people due to war and labor who only receive meager subsidies, former prisoners of war who are still waiting for subsidy lists, elderly people who need 4,000 francs per month, mothers with many children, and housewives who are directly affected by rising living expenses, etc., as well as the demands of working peasants, small owners, agricultural operators, and tenant farmers, who are suffering from the ever-increasing gap between the prices of agricultural products and the prices of manufactured goods. Finally, there are the demands of artisans and small merchants whose incomes are decreasing and whose tax burdens are heavy, and the demands of people who have suffered the pain of war. When billions are spent on war, many of them still live in ruins.

     ★

　　The Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, at its meeting in Prague last month, decided to convene the Second World Peace Congress. The communiqué issued by the Standing Committee in this regard makes it possible to expand and better organize the movement to defend peace. Peace fighters are exposing aggression wherever it occurs and condemning armed interference in the internal affairs of nations. They welcome and support peaceful initiatives calling for an end to the Korean War. They strongly protested the indiscriminate bombing of civilians. Peace fighters demand that the Security Council, with legal representatives from the five major powers, allow both sides in Korea to have the opportunity to state their views and resolve the Korean conflict as soon as possible. Peace fighters demand a ban on all forms of war propaganda in all countries.

　　There is no doubt that the call of the peace fighters will reach the hearts of the masses. We are determined to do everything possible to ensure the complete success of the Second World Peace Congress and to facilitate the holding of peace preparation meetings in various residential areas, factories, and provinces.

　　The recommendations made by the Standing Committee's Prague meeting raise a question that is of particular concern to us. That is the question of the absolute necessity of unity, the necessity of mutual understanding in order to achieve this unity. Let us recall the declaration made by the Seine Province Committee of the Communist Party in February 1949, which was later mentioned again by the 12th Party Congress. This declaration stated: "We believe it is useful to announce the following again: We communists, while reserving the right to express our views in all circumstances, fully acknowledge that all other true peace advocates have the right to hold their own views on various issues, including important issues such as the profound causes of the new war danger and the necessary methods and means to defend peace. On this issue, we can have friendly debates with sincere peace advocates. In our opinion, what is important is the necessity, the urgent necessity, of uniting to defend peace."

　　We have always been active fighters for unity. But we know that to achieve unity and maintain it, we need patient and persistent efforts, and we need to wage constant struggles, not only to patiently persuade working people, strive to mobilize republicans and patriots, but also to expose the conspiracies and tricks of the enemies of unity. In addition to carrying out other work, we should not confuse socialist workers with their leaders, and we must always link our brotherly relations with them with exposing the work of these leaders.

　　Resolutely exposing the right-wing socialist leaders and their treacherous policies is not only not unnecessary, but it is also the first thing that is needed and required to establish brotherly relations with those workers who are still socialists and still influenced by the party.

　　We should especially remember at all times that the united front means struggle. All agreements, including electoral agreements, are only meaningful if they help to start or continue joint struggles for one or another demand, for one or another project of a jointly formulated program.

　　Without organization, there can be no real struggle. Therefore, all kinds of unity committees are particularly important, especially those committees that are democratically elected in various enterprises and residential areas and carry out certain activities. We can only welcome and support the initiatives of various mass organizations such as the Peace and Freedom Fighters Movement and trade unions, the French Women's League, etc., which are carrying out propaganda work in order to elect various people's committees at the provincial conferences and the preparatory meetings for the Second World Peace Congress.

　　Until the 12th Congress, we were mainly engaged in the struggle against the blindness and complacency of those who denied or underestimated the danger of war. At the same time, we also exposed the false and harmful inevitability of war. Today, no one doubts the reality of the danger of war anymore. We must focus our criticism on the erroneous idea of the inevitability of war. This intolerable opinion, like underestimating the danger of war, leads to opportunistic passivity.

　　No, war is not inevitable. No, war is not something destined by fate. It depends on the people of all countries, on the working class, and on all peace advocates, and thus also on us communists, on our activities to defeat the imperialist war and fascization plans.

　　We must also continue to wage ideological and political struggles in order to eliminate the narrow sectarian views that still prevail among us, especially on the issue of unity, which is unprecedentedly needed today.

　　What is the common goal of millions of men and women today? That is to defend peace. We are so determined to strengthen and expand the movement to defend peace and strive for national independence that we will spare no effort to achieve this goal.

　　The struggle against extending the term of military service to eighteen months is currently an integral part of our struggle for peace. True to its traditional spirit, the General Confederation of Labor has initiated the organization of an action committee, which, in addition to the trade unions, is also composed of the Communist Party, the Unified Socialist Party, the French Veterans Association, and the French Republican Youth League.

　　The grand rally held in Buffalo Square marked the beginning of powerful demonstrations across the country. Soldiers voiced their dissatisfaction, and those serving in the military opposed the eighteen-month term. The protest movement unfolded particularly vigorously in the countryside. The organizations affiliated with the action committee are not the only ones fighting against the extension of military service. In many places, socialists, members of "Workers' Force" trade unions, and members of Catholic organizations are signing petitions and participating in protest demonstrations. The Catholic Labor Youth League of the Loire department (the department that elected Pidault as a member of the National Assembly) and a group of Catholic Labor Youth in the Paris region are working with the "French Republican Youth League" to demand that the action committees in various factories and urban areas carry out struggles against these measures of the government.

　　As a result of the policies of militarization and rearmament, the working masses are forced to bear an increasingly heavy burden. Military expenditures will reach 700 billion francs this year, accounting for 30% of all government spending. According to the three-year plan that has been formulated, another 2 trillion francs will be added.

　　The government will try to make up for these huge expenditures by increasing taxes and inflation. Inflation means higher prices. Because the Americans have seized the sources of raw materials, prices have generally risen sharply in the past few months. Although wages have increased, inflation will still reduce the actual living standards of the working people unless the General Confederation of Labor wins the victory of demanding the adoption of a system that determines wages based on the prices of products.

　　Our national economy is transitioning to a wartime system and will continue to cause the decline of production and the bankruptcy of some enterprises in which warmongers are not interested. These sectors will be hit by unemployment. And because the reconstruction work has stalled, unemployment is already affecting workers in many industries, especially construction workers.

　　The Schuman Plan puts our basic industries—and thus the entire French economy—under the control of the Ruhr magnates and their American creditors, thus further aggravating the disastrous consequences of the Marshall Plan.

　　Under these conditions, the struggles for the current demands of the working people in urban and rural areas have acquired and will continue to acquire increasing importance. The task of the communists is to explain to the masses that the root cause of their poverty lies in the government's war policies. The struggle for partial and urgent demands must be combined with the great struggle for peace and freedom.

　　★ ★ ★

　　On September 11, the American magazine *Time* wrote: "Communism is just as strong in France today as it was two years ago...That is why France remains an unknown quantity in the calculations of the US military authorities."

　　Note this admission. The influence and prestige of the Communist Party among the masses are not declining. The existence and activities of the French Communist Party are incompatible with the "calculations of the US military authorities"; in other words, they are incompatible with the preparation and launching of anti-Soviet aggression.

　　We have earned the hatred of the enemies of the people—this is our glory and our pride. Everything that arouses the hatred of the warmongers guarantees us the trust of a broader mass of people. The working people fully realize that the warmongers want to strike at the activists of our Communist Party, to strike at those who defend the interests of the working people and call on the working people to resist, in order to exploit the working people more cruelly and throw them into the horrors of a new war.

　　The masses of people will resist extraordinary measures, arbitrary means, and the increasing fascization of the so-called "democratic system" of the United States and the West.

　　More attention must be paid to the issue of propaganda, and the lies and slanders of the warmongers must be vigorously exposed. Imperialism has many possible means: there are corrupt newspapers with billions of dollars invested in them, radio stations that spread lies like during the Hitler occupation, decadent literature, and movie theaters. In these movie theaters, good films that are occasionally shown are overshadowed by the obscene and poisoning American films that promote gangsterism, espionage, and war. We must carry out resolute struggles against all this, make the most of our conditions, increase the sales of our daily newspapers, weekly newspapers, and magazines, especially *L'Humanité* and *France Nouvelle*, increase the sales of newspapers in various enterprises and residential areas, and promote the initiative of grassroots organizations—branches and groups—in distributing pamphlets and making them sell quickly. We must revise our methods of oral propaganda and not limit ourselves to attending several mass rallies; we must build a real propaganda army that can bring the truth to the working people in various factories and villages.

　　The Party must redouble its efforts in all aspects of organizational work and give special attention to the branches in various enterprises and the grassroots Party committees. In the struggle for current demands and the struggle for peace, new forces are emerging. New loyal cadres must be cultivated from passionate young people and women, and they must be boldly promoted to responsible positions.

　　Criticism and self-criticism must be carried out in all organizations of the Party, as exemplified by the Twelfth Congress. Our duty is to redouble our efforts to improve the ideological level of Party members and Party activists, in order to spread among them the Marxist-Leninist theory that has been promoted and expanded by our beloved and great Comrade Stalin, the leader of the world's working people.

　　Finally, it must be emphasized again that it is necessary to improve the revolutionary vigilance of all Party members and all working people, in order to expose and denounce the provocateurs and spies that the enemy is trying to plant in our ranks; in order to protect the Party's activists from the criminal murder that caused our comrade Lahaut to sacrifice himself; in order to effectively protect the various organizations of the working class and the democratic movement, and to protect the Party departments and branches of the Communist Party and the addresses of trade unions and associations from attacks by fascist bandits.

　　We are heading towards a great battle that will determine the fate of our children, our country, and all mankind. Let everyone show firmness and initiative. The increasing and incalculable strength of the people of all countries, the strength of democracy and peace, will force the forces of fascism and war to retreat. Life will triumph over death. We will work diligently, confidently, and resolutely in order to expand and win the battle for peace and national independence.

　　扩大并赢得争取和平的斗争
    一九五○年九月二十九日在法国共产党中央委员会全体会议上的报告
    法国共产党总书记多列士
    六个月来的时局发展充分证明了我党第十二次中央全会对国际形势所作的估计：“和平系于千钧一发。”
    美国武装部队对朝鲜与台湾的干涉说明了帝国主义战争贩子们已经从准备侵略进到公开侵略各国人民。美帝国主义者对朝鲜一个小国进行他们的掠夺性的殖民战争，至今已有三月，朝鲜正在为自由、统一和国家独立而英勇作战。
    美帝国主义者企图用可恶的谰言与诽谤宣传运动来使全世界相信他们是所谓保卫正义与文明的战士。好像任何人都能够迫使各国人民忘记朝鲜人民是在他们自己的家中似的！侵略者是美国人，他们正在把远处美国数千英里以外的，太平洋彼岸的一个小国浸在血泊之中。全世界在听到美国飞机如何用恐怖轰炸的方法有计划地把汉城和朝鲜其他城市夷为废墟、焚毁村庄、消灭平民：妇女、儿童和老年人时，都不胜愤慨。
    美国政府对中国也发动公开侵略，企图夺取中国的台湾。美国人希望替被中国人民驱逐的蒋介石保有一个基地。他们要把台湾变成在太平洋的跳板。美国飞机已经轰炸了中国东北的村庄，虽然如此，联合国组织仍拒绝考虑中华人民共和国政府的控诉。
    派遣美国军事使团赴印度支那，充分暴露了已经对越南人民进行了四年的“肮脏战争”的真正本质。
    美国资本家在帝国主义阵营反对亚洲各国人民的斗争中自居领导地位。这些亚洲国家人民已经从殖民地的剥削下把自己解放出来或者正在为他们的独立而战斗。帝国主义者不甘心于亚洲各国人民独立。他们想紧紧束缚这些国家的人民或者重新奴役他们。英、法、荷、比等国政府——殖民地的所有主——首先追随要对侵略朝鲜与中国的行为负责的美国政府，这不是很好的证明吗？而且，这些国家的政府不是在美国的示范下与命令下迫使联合国走上破产与丧失威信的道路吗？
    帝国主义者所发动的朝鲜与越南战争只能加深殖民地制度的危机。这次战争正在引起帝国主义的基地进一步缩小。亚洲与非洲各国人民争取独立的斗争，对于争取和平的共同斗争是一个有效的贡献。这已由摩洛哥与突尼斯民族主义团体最近发表的声明证明，他们拒绝参加帝国主义者正在准备的反对苏联的战争。这样，在争取和平的斗争中，以工人阶级为首的宗主国人民以及殖民地与半殖民地人民正在实现战斗性的团结，这团结将保证他们的共同事业——自由与和平的事业、各国人民独立的事业——的胜利。
    美国在朝鲜的侵略是美帝国主义者正在准备的反对中国与苏联的战争的总计划的组成部分。美国希望在打算用来对苏联、中国与人民民主国家进行战争的庞大而且几乎连绵不断的空军与海军基地网及跳板网上再加上新的环节。这就说明了为什么会有侵略性的大西洋公约，为什么会有最近“三人”（美英法三国外长——编者）与“十二人”（北大西洋公约成员国代表——编者）会议关于重新武装德国的决定，以及为什么任命马歇尔将军为美国国防部长。
    我们曾经屡次说过，马歇尔计划是一个战争计划。今天已没有人对此再有疑问了。在社会经济领域内，这计划的后果已经证明为马歇尔化国家招致灾难，就我国而论，马歇尔计划已经使复兴停止，而且已经引起生产衰落，国民经济的许多部门（特别是飞机工业）破产、农业衰退、贸易停滞、工资不能糊口、失业、物价上涨三倍、捐税苛重、政府入不敷出、通货膨胀、以及稳定法郎价值的可能性日益减低等等。
    美国资本家已经剥夺了我国经济上的与政治上的独立。尽管人民反抗，法国仍被拖到冒险与战争的道路上。美国资本家及其可卑的走狗力图使法国人民反对他们的友人与盟国——苏联。他们迫使我国放弃我国有权向德国要求的安全保证与赔偿。他们希望迫使在战后还没有充分恢复过来的法国，同意重新武装西德，西德已经被包括在大西洋公约的侵略体系里面。
    今天，当残酷的现实撕破了谎言与幻想的帷幕时，马歇尔计划已经原形毕露，证明是一个反动的计划，贫困和战争的计划。以前就可以预见到这个计划将与大西洋公约合而为一。它正在导向法国与德国对苏联进行罪恶战争的可恶的同盟。
    美国主子们发布命令要所有马歇尔化的国家延长军役的期限，意图对苏联进行侵略。在法国，作为开端，军役期限已经延长至十八个月。已经服满军役的年青兵士们将被迫再服役三个月。将军役限期延长至十八个月是一个旨在发动战争的措施。这样将使政府能够派遣服役的年青兵士们，到非洲与亚洲去进行反对殖民地人民的掠夺战争。美国主子们希望靠延长军役期限在马歇尔化国家得到他们反苏战争的炮灰。
    为了强迫人民同意将军役期限延长至十八个月，人民的敌人们提出论据说，苏联拥有强大的陆军。比起苏联的人口与领土面积来，这不是一支很大的陆军。幸运的是，这支军队证明是强大的足够摧毁希特勒匪徒，把法国与欧洲从奴役中拯救出来。它必须保持它的力量，以便在必要时击退资本主义国家的任何新的侵略。正当全世界充斥了帝国主义者要求对社会主义国家与和平发动“先发制人”战争的歇斯的里的叫嚣的时候，苏联不能放松它的警觉性，而且只能对于加强它的军事力量表示经常的关心。
    亲美派政党的人士想要使得法国人民相信：苏联正在破坏和平并威胁我国。但是，法国人民并不愿受骗。他们没有忘却，并且永远也不会忘却从保卫斯大林格勒的英雄们，从苏联的兵士们，从他们所爱戴的并崇敬的领袖——伟大的斯大林所得到的好处。法国的人民现在不愿，将来也不愿对苏联作战。
    一切正直的人们都知道苏联各族人民正在全力履行他们的伟大的历史任务——完成社会主义的建设并逐步转入共产主义社会，在这个社会里，“从各取所值转到各取所需”（马克思）的原则将被实现。苏联各族人民既已完成了希特勒强盗们所破坏的区域——这个区域的面积有法国四倍大——的复兴工作，他们就开始了改造自然的巨大工作，改变辽阔的土地上的气候和地形，在这里将为人民创造出更加良好的生活与工作的条件。正在成百万成千万英亩的土地上建造森林带。正在建造巨大的水闸和强大的水力发电站。另外还在开凿运河，这些运河将把干燥的草原和沙漠变成肥沃的田野。
    人人都还记得维辛斯基在联合国大会最近一次会议上说的话：“在苏联，我们不使用原子能去储备原子弹，虽然我有把握：假使不幸一旦需要原子弹的话，那么将是要多少，有多少。我们要使原子能服务于和平建设的伟大任务，以便夷平高山，改变河道，灌溉沙漠，在人迹罕到之处开拓新路。”
    未被对于苏联的成见与仇恨所蒙蔽的法国人——而且他们是占绝大多数的——都知道苏联已经不屈不挠地奉行，并且还将继续奉行和平政策，这项和平政策是基于资本主义与社会主义两个制度可以长期共存的可能性。
    苏联没有干涉其他国家的事务。它从来没有，现在也不威胁任何民族。事实上法国的国家利益和苏联的国家利益两者毫无冲突之处。事实上法国与苏联双方都关切使不可能再度产生德国帝国主义的威胁。事实上苏联从没有向我国要求领土、要求海军或者空军基地，或者提出军事、经济或政治性的任何其他要求。
    既然如此，我们就说恢复反苏反共政策，是因为资产阶级和他们在政府中的代表们首先盘算其自私的利益，把他们阶级的考虑放在前面，除此之外，怎么可能有其他的解释呢？
    他们血口喷人，大肆攻击苏联，这是因为苏联这个社会主义国家的存在本身就使得世界革命化，因为它以对不可避免的、必需解放的信心鼓舞着被压迫的群众，同时也因为苏联是和平与民主的保垒，是保卫各族人民独立的斗士。
    这样，便说明了资本家和他们的奴仆——右翼社会党领袖们所奉行的制造贫穷与战争的反动政策的阶级根源。他们正在准备反苏战争，力图在无产阶级中消灭对解放的希望，紧紧束缚住殖民地人民并倒转历史的车轮。他们了解：他们是注定要灭亡的并且骇怕正在兴起的力量，正向前迈进来取他们的地位而代之的未来力量。
    但是统治阶级为维持其已经动摇的统治而运用的一切手段却只能加重这个瓦解中的社会的矛盾，腐朽的资本主义的矛盾。对于工人阶级与和平斗士的野蛮镇压，西方“民主国家”的法西斯化——这一切也应同时视为准备战争手段和资产阶级的领导集团已经疯狂的证明。
    帝国主义者为了要阻止人民大众对战争与贫穷化政策所进行的斗争，就采取恐怖与暗杀活动家的手段，其情形和昨日之希特勒与墨索里尼所做的及今日之佛朗哥与铁托所正在做的是一模一样的。他们曾试图暗杀意大利劳动人民领袖托里亚蒂和日本共产党书记德田球一。他们暗杀了比利时共产党主席，国际工人阶级运动最有声望的人物之一我们的拉豪特同志。
    美国就是一个例子。几天之前一名共产党人即因接获非法驱逐出境的命令后，未能迅速地离开该城，而被暗杀在他自己的家里了。有好多共产党员工人已在那里被杀害了！有好多的黑人在各种借口下被处私刑或者公然地被杀害了！这个数目是数不清的！
    美国同时也可作为非法镇压工人领袖的例子。我们的兄弟党——美国共产党的领袖们被判处五年徒刑，就只是因为他们宣传共产主义思想的缘故。在美国，进步的作家如法斯特与马尔兹，以及电影业的著名进步人士已被投进监牢。在美国，所谓非美活动委员会真是胡作非为；它是这样的一个组织，它已把告密与特务活动变成一种全国性的灾祸；可巧，这个委员会的“正直的”主席最近被判定犯了欺诈罪。在美国，刚才已制订了一项法西斯法律来强迫共产党党员向警察登记，并且一旦战争发生或处于“紧急状态”时，他们都须开到集中营里去。
    美国正命令马歇尔化国家的政府对于共产党人采取非常的措施。而由莫克为首的法国“社会党”部长们已经成为法国军事化的新法律的倡议人。莫克之流已经成为对付忠于工人阶级及其为和平而斗争的传统精神的共产党人采取非常措施的倡导者。
    不久以前，杰出的科学家，法国的骄傲，我们的朋友约里奥—居里就是在美国的命令之下被解除了原子能高级专员的职位。戴克西埃教授在这个科学研究机关的领导职位也被解除了。法国政府，还要再来一个打击——要把一切共产党人解除文职。在法国，他们已经在谈论宣布法国共产党为非法的事了。两手染污了无辜牺牲者的鲜血的达拉第竟敢要求禁止共产党！他还不满足于替希特勒准备侵略以及使得法国蒙受的一切的灾祸，如他对共产党人采取非法的措施并让纳粹代理人在法国胡作非为。
    一切共和分子都体验到：反共产党人的罪恶法律与命令是对于全体人民的一种威胁：在迫害共产党人之后，人民的公敌就开始迫害社会党人共和分子与拒绝服从法西斯独裁的民主保卫者。
    在法国，著名的工人与和平保卫者现在都受到野蛮的镇压，而通敌分子与卖国贼却被释放；普利文威胁爱国人士而对卖国贼却宣布大赦。目前的法国统治者非法地逮捕并驱逐工人流亡者，其中包括西班牙反法西斯分子，同时他们却加强他们和佛朗哥的联系，佛朗哥是他们如遇反苏战争时的一个可能的盟友。法境阿尔及尔的劳动人民受到迫害，他们的报纸被禁止，而法西斯安德斯匪帮与铁托奸细却可以横行霸道。
    活动家遭受攻击，工人住所与民主团体的舍址遭受袭击的事愈来愈多，一个卑鄙的告密和特务活动的警察机构正在成立中。莫克正在组织法西斯型的警卫队。这些后备兵是从警察和志愿兵抽调来的，在平时，这些部队已将警察实力增加三倍以便对工人阶级斗争。不难看出这些警察辅助队将会成个什么样子：资本家的子弟，富农，前殖民者，土匪，与其他残渣。总而言之，它是建立一个新法西斯民军——新的法国志愿兵军团的问题。工人阶级和一切共和分子必须一齐大力抗议这个行动。他们必须打击公开合法地成立法西斯匪帮的行动。这是我们在一九三四年二月的事例中所学得的教训，当时由于工人阶级的联合行动，这些企图曾遭受决定性的反击。
    在意大利，加斯贝利也提出一个黑衫组织的计划。比利时也正在作同样的准备。我们不得不指出在意大利、比利时、和法国受到鼓吹的反对劳动人民的法西斯措施的一致的性质。
    最后，为了将来的选举，一个伪造的选举法正在准备中。这个选举法公开地被人赞扬是一个使五百万投票赞成我们的党的法国男女失去他们在国民议会的代表的工具。
    暗杀、暗杀的企图，恐怖、警察镇压、非常措施、宣布人民的忠实保卫者为非法——所有这些都是走向法西斯化的新的步骤。人民的敌人正在为反苏战争准备后方防线。斯大林同志一九三四年在布尔什维克党的第十七次代表大会上提出，必须认为法西斯主义是资产阶级孱弱的标志，而不是资产阶级有力量的标志。工人阶级和所有和平与自由的战士们已经使罗尼省同志们无罪开释，他们也会找到达到其他胜利的方法，他们不会不表现保卫他们的活动家和组织，迫使法西斯主义和战争向后退却的必要的警觉性和坚定性。
    法国和世界其他各地形势的显著特点是和平力量的稳步壮大，广大群众对于威胁着他们的危险的规模有了日益清楚的了解，以及团结所有要自由与和平的人民与国家，采取坚决的行动反对战争贩子以避免危险的坚定的决心。
    斯德哥尔摩宣言和征集签名运动正取到了初步的重大的成功。美帝国主义者不敢对朝鲜人民使用原子弹，尽管他们想这样做，尽管卑鄙的禽兽们要求他们这样做。如所预期的，斯德哥尔摩签名运动鼓舞了争取和平的斗争。工人阶级继续进行反对制造和运输战争物资的群众性政治斗争，码头工人在最前列。
    为了眼前要求的斗争也显著地加紧起来。由于物价与一九四七年相比平均上涨了两倍，工人们不能满足于普利文和摩勒答应给与他们的不能果腹的工资。
    在争取提高工资的斗争中，尽管“工人力量”的领袖们——美帝国主义者的走狗——猛烈反对，总工会、天主教工会联合会、和“工人力量”的成员和组织间仍然一致行动。现在已不可能计算各个省份的各业劳动人民一致行动的所有事例了。这保证了劳动人民在争取较高工资的斗争中的必然胜利。这个争取面包的斗争，同时也是争取和平的斗争，它的非常意义无论如何估计也不为过高。保卫和平、反对延长军役期限到十八个月的战斗性的口号常常是在工人们一致同意下提出的，像巴黎地区许多企业中的情况一样。即使共同斗争仅仅是在要求提高工资的口号下进行，它对于争取和平的战斗也确是一个贡献。实际上，它意味着，劳动人民拒绝支付统治者实行的战争政策的费用。它意味着劳动人民不愿付出为了继续进行反越南人民的战争，为了准备反苏侵略而要求于他们的牺牲。
    共产党人的责任在于缜密地估计他们在里面工作的企业的情况，并设法正确地表达劳动人民的情绪，帮助工会拟订正当的要求，并站在要满足这些要求的共同斗争的最前列。
    这自然也适用于争取达到遭受人民敌人的战争政策之苦的各业劳动人民提出的眼前要求的斗争。这是指公务员的要求，尤其是薪水赶不上较高生活费用的低薪雇员、退伍军人、抵抗运动的成员，只有微薄扶助金的因战争和劳动而残废的人、仍在等候津贴名册的以前的战俘、每月需要四千法郎的老年人、多子女的母亲、和直接受到生活费用上涨影响的主妇们等等的要求，还有劳动农民、小所有者、农业经营者、和佃农们的要求，他们都身受农产品价格和大大上涨的制成品价格之间的差额日益增大的痛苦。最后，还有收入减少而捐税负担沉重的手工业者和小商人的要求，和曾经身受战争痛苦的人民的要求。当数十亿为了战争耗去的时候，他们中却还有许多人仍然生活在废墟中。

    世界拥护和平大会常设委员会执行局上月在布拉格举行的会议，决定召开第二届世界拥护和平大会。常设委员会就此发表的文告使得扩大和更好地组织保卫和平的运动成为可能。和平斗士正在揭露侵略，不论它是在什么地方发生的，并谴责对各民族内政的武装干涉行为。他们欢迎并支持要求停止朝鲜战争的和平倡议。他们坚决抗议对平民的滥肆轰炸。和平斗士要求有五大国合法代表出席的安理会让朝鲜双方均有陈述意见的可能，而尽速解决朝鲜冲突问题。和平斗士要求禁止各国一切形式的战争宣传。
    无可怀疑，和平斗士的号召将能到达人民大众的心中。我们则决将尽一切能力促成第二届世界拥护和平大会的完全成功，并且便利各居民区、各工厂、各省举行和平筹备会议。
    常设委员会布拉格会议所作的建议提出了一个与我们特别有关的问题。那就是团结的绝对必要性、为了达成这种团结而相互了解的必要性的问题。我们且来回忆一下塞纳省共产党省委会一九四九年二月的会议所作的，后又经第十二次党代表大会再度提到的宣言，这篇宣言说：“我们以为再把下事宣布一次是有益处的：我们共产党人虽然保留在一切情况下表示我们的观点的权利，可是却完全承认其他一切真正的和平拥护者有权对各种问题持有他们的见解，其中包括像新战争危险的深刻的原因，以及保卫和平所必需的方式方法这类重要问题。在这问题上，我们可以和真诚的和平拥护者们作友谊的争论。依我们看来，重要的是团结起来保卫和平的必要性，迫切的必要性。”
    我们一贯都是积极争取团结的斗士。但是，我们知道，要达到团结并且保持团结，就需要耐心的坚持不渝的努力，需要作经常的斗争，不仅要耐心地说服劳动人民，努力行动的共和分子及爱国者、还要揭露团结之敌的阴谋诡计。除了应进行其他工作外，还不应该把社会党工人与他们的领袖混淆起来，必须经常把对他们的兄弟关系与揭露这些领袖的工作联系起来。
    坚决揭露右翼社会党领袖及其背叛的政策，不但不是不要而且还是首先需要和要求与那些仍然是社会党员及仍然受该党影响的工人建立兄弟般的关系。
    我们特别应该随时记着：统一阵线意味着斗争。一切协定，包括选举协定在内，只有在它们有助于为了这一种或那一种要求、为了共同拟定的纲领的这一个或那一个项目而开始或继续联合斗争时，才是有意义的。
    如果没有组织，就不可能有真正的斗争。因此，各式各样的团结委员会就特别的重要，特别是那些在各企业、各居民区民主选出而进行一定活动的委员会。我们唯有欢迎和支持和平自由战士运动及工会、法兰西妇女联盟等等各种群众团体的倡议，它们正在进行宣传工作，以便在省会议及第二届世界拥护和平大会的筹备会议上选出各人民委员会。
    一直到第十二次代表大会，我们都主要是进行斗争，反对那些否认或低估战争危险的人的盲目与自满。同时，我们也揭露虚伪而有害的战争不可避免论。今天，再也没有人怀疑战争危险的现实性了。我们必须集中批评战争不可避免论的错误思想。这种不可容忍的意见与低估战争危险一样造成机会主义的被动性。
    不是的，战争不是不可避免的。不是的，战争不是什么由命运注定的东西。它取决于各国人民、取决于工人阶级并取决于全体和平拥护者，因而也取决于我们共产党人、取决于我们挫败帝国主义战争与法西斯化计划的活动。
    我们还必须继续进行思想上与政治上的斗争，以便消除我们当中特别是在今日空前需要的团结问题上仍然流行的狭窄的宗派主义的见解。
    今天，千百万男女的共同目标是什么呢？那就是保卫和平。我们如此决心加强和扩大保卫和平、争取民族独立的运动，我们将不遗余力达到这一目标。
    反对延长军役期限至十八个月的斗争，目前是我们争取和平的斗争不可分的一部分。总工会忠于其传统的精神，倡议组织一个行动委员会，此委员会除去工会之外，还由共产党、单一社会党、法兰西退伍军人联盟及法兰西共和青年联盟组成。
    在布法罗广场举行的盛大集会标志着全国各地强大示威的开始。士兵发出不满的呼声，服兵役的人反对十八个月的期限。抗议运动在乡村特别蓬勃地展开。为反对延长兵役期限而斗争的并非仅只是行动委员会那些会员组织。在许多地方，社会党人、“工人力量”工会会员及天主教组织的成员，都在签署请愿书，而且参加抗议示威。罗亚尔省（选举皮杜尔为国民议会议员的省份）的天主教劳动青年联盟及巴黎区一批天主教劳动青年正在与“法国共和青年联盟”一同行动，要求各工厂与市内各区的行动委员会进行斗争，反对政府的这些措施。
    由于军事化和重整军备的政策的结果，劳动群众被迫担负起日益沉重的负担。军费今年将达七千亿法郎，将占全部国家开支的百分之三十。根据所拟定的三年计划，还要增加二万亿法郎。
    政府将试图以增加税收及通货膨胀的方式来补足这些巨大的开支。通货膨胀意味着更高的物价。由于美国人攫取了原料来源地，过去数月中，物价已普遍地高涨了。虽然工资增加，但除非总工会要求采行根据生产品价格决定工资的制度一举获得胜利，否则通货膨胀仍将降低劳动人民的实际生活标准。
    我们的国民经济正在过渡到战时体制，并且将继续造成生产的衰落和某些战争贩子不感兴趣的企业的倒闭。这些部门将受到失业的打击。而由于复兴工作停顿，失业已经在影响许多行业的工人，特别是建筑工人。
    舒曼计划把我们的基本工业——因此也是法国整个经济——置于鲁尔的大亨及他们的美国债主的控制下，因而将进一步加重马歇尔计划的灾难性的后果。
    在这些条件下，为城乡劳动人民当前的要求而进行的斗争，就取得了并将继续取得日益增加的重要性。共产党人的任务就是向群众说明：他们贫困的深刻原因在于政府的战争政策。必须把争取部分的与急切的要求的斗争、与争取和平和自由的伟大斗争结合起来。

    九月十一日，美国《时代》杂志写道：共产主义今天在法国正和两年前一样强大………这就是为什么法国仍然是美国军事当局算盘中的未知数的原因。
    请注意这一承认。共产党在群众中的影响和威望不是在降低。法国共产党的存在和活动与“美国军事当局的算盘”势不两立的；换言之，是和准备与发动反苏侵略势不两立的。
    我们已经获得人民之敌的仇恨——这是我们的光荣，也是我们的骄傲。凡引起战争贩子仇恨的一切，都保证我们得到更广大群众的信任。劳动人民充分认识到战争贩子要打击我们共产党的活动家，打击那些保卫劳动人民的利益并号召劳动人民起来抵抗的人们，以便更加残酷地剥削劳动人民并把他们投入新战争的恐怖状态里。
    人民群众将抵抗非常的措施，专横手段，以及所谓美国与西方的“民主制度”的日益法西斯化。
    必须对宣传问题赋予更多注意，必须大力地揭露战争贩子的谎言和诽谤。帝国主义拥有很多可能的手段：有数十亿元投在上面的腐化的报纸，像在希特勒占领时期一样发出谎言的电台，颓废的文学，以及电影院。在这些电影院，偶而上演的好的影片被宣扬匪徒活动，间谍活动和战争的美国的猥亵与毒化影片所掩没。我们必须对这一切进行坚决的斗争，尽量利用我们的条件，增加我们的日报、周报、杂志，尤其是《人道报》和《法兰西新闻》的销路，增加报纸在各企业中和各居民区的销路，促进低层组织——支部与小组——在发行小册子并使之迅速销行方面的主动性。我们必须修改我们的口头宣传方法，并且不限于参加若干次群众集会；我们必须建立一支真正能够把真理带给各工厂及乡村劳动人民的宣传大军。
    党必须加倍努力进行各方面的组织工作，给各企业的支部及低层党委员会以特别注意。在争取当前要求和争取和平的斗争中，新的力量正在涌现出来。必须由充满热情的青年和妇女中培养新的忠诚的干部，并大胆地提拔他们到负责岗位上来。
    必须在党的一切组织中开展批评与自我批评，十二次代表大会树立了这样的榜样。我们的职责就是加倍努力提高党员与党的活动家的思想水平，以便在他们中间转播为世界劳动人民的领袖我们敬爱的伟大的斯大林同志加以发扬光大的马列主义理论。
    最后，必须再度强调指出需要提高全体党员和全体劳动人民的革命警惕性，以便揭露和痛斥敌人力图安插到我们队伍中的挑拨者和奸细；以便保护党的活动人物免遭曾使得我们的拉豪特同志牺牲的罪恶谋害；以便有效地保护工人阶级和民主运动的各种组织，保护共产党各党部与支部以及工会，社团的会址不受法西斯匪徒的袭击。
    我们正在走向将要决定我们的儿童、我们的国家以及全人类的命运的大的战斗，让每一个人都表现出坚定性和主动性。各国人民的日益增长的无法计算的力量，民主与和平的力量，将迫使法西斯主义与战争的力量退却。生命将战胜死亡。我们将有信心地有决心地努力工作，以便扩大并赢得争取和平与民族独立的战斗。
