Xinhua News Agency, 12th Dispatch: The people of the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and Romania are angrily protesting the British authorities' unreasonable refusal to issue entry visas to representatives attending the Second World Peace Congress. According to a TASS dispatch from Berlin: On the 11th, the Federation of Free German Trade Unions Committee, representing five million members, expressed a serious protest to the British authorities, pointing out that the British reactionary measures proved the British Labour Party government's fear of peace. This can only strengthen the solidarity of the peace camp and encourage more people to participate in the struggle.

The Polish delegation of scientists and the delegation of the Council of the Association of Journalists submitted a protest to the British Embassy in Poland on the 9th, pointing out that the British authorities' refusal to issue visas was detrimental to the cause of world peace. The British Ambassador to Poland even refused to meet with the delegation and did not allow any embassy staff to speak with the delegation.

According to the Romanian News Agency: The Romanian Committee for the Defense of Peace sent telegrams to the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress and the British Peace Committee on the 9th, protesting the British authorities' unreasonable refusal to issue entry visas to thirteen Romanian representatives.

Xinhua News Agency, 12th Dispatch: The British government has obstructed and undermined the plan to hold the Second World Peace Congress in Britain in various ways. So far, the government has refused entry to the vast majority of representatives to the Second World Peace Congress. According to TASS: Montagu, chairman of the organizing committee of the World Peace Congress, strongly protested the British government's tyrannical measures at a press conference held in London on the 9th. He said: The British government has refused to issue entry visas to two categories of people: one is those who hold important positions in the peace movement in their own countries, all of whom have been refused entry; the other is well-known figures in certain fields of work, such as outstanding writers, musicians, and religious figures. Almost all members of the organizing committee of the World Peace Congress have been refused entry. So far, only 220 representatives have obtained visas.

The Pravda correspondent in London, Mayevsky, reported on the 10th that the British ruling clique is drafting a special plan to take police measures to monitor the every move of the World Peace Congress representatives who have already arrived in Britain. The leadership of the British Labour Party has forbidden its members to sign the peace declaration or participate in the congress. Distributing the peace declaration in schools is also prohibited.

Forty Soviet representatives have been refused entry. Many of them are world-renowned peace fighters, such as: Tikhonov, Chairman of the All-Soviet Committee for the Defense of Peace, famous writers Fadeyev, Simonov, Ehrenburg, Korneychuk and Vasilevskaya, famous composer Shostakovich, famous director Gerasimov, journalist Zaslavsky, Klutizhai, and Metropolitan Nicholas of the Diocese of Kolomna. Wellman, Secretary-General of the German Committee for the Defense of Peace, Professor Tim Baufsky, Chairman of the Polish National Committee for the Defense of Peace, and Professor Wuger, Chairman of the Danish Committee for the Defense of Peace, have also been refused entry. All Mexican representatives have been refused entry.

According to L'Humanité: The British government has refused to issue entry visas to French progressive journalists covering the World Peace Congress and has demanded that the L'Humanité journalists who have already traveled to Britain leave the country.

Xinhua News Agency, 12th Dispatch: According to a Telcon dispatch from Mexico City on the 10th: The Mexican people widely protested the Cuban police's unreasonable detention of three Mexican representatives attending the Second World Peace Congress. The representatives all carried diplomatic passports, including General Yara, 71, one of the founders of the Republic of Mexico. Although the representatives were released after negotiations, protest letters poured in. The Mexican Communist Party believes this is part of the US State Department's overall plan to attack peace-loving people. *La Prensa* also pointed out that this action was instigated by US imperialism. The Latin American Labor Federation and the Mexican Youth League have both issued protest letters. Mexican social figures and military officers have also protested.
