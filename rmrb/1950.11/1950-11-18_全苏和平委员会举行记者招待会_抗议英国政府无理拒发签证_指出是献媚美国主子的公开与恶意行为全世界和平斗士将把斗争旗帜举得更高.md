Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 13th: The All-Soviet Peace Committee held a press conference on the 10th of this month regarding the British government's unreasonable refusal to issue entry visas to forty Soviet representatives attending the Second World Peace Congress.

Members of the All-Soviet Peace Committee, representatives attending the Second World Peace Congress, and representatives of foreign and Soviet press attended the press conference.

Simonov, a member of the Presidium of the All-Soviet Peace Committee and a writer, delivered a statement on behalf of the committee, stating: The British government has refused to issue entry visas to most of the elected Soviet representatives to the Second World Peace Congress. Among the forty representatives who were denied visas, some are well-known not only domestically but also internationally. They are prominent figures in science, literature, and the arts, public health and education, as well as representatives of trade unions and cultural religious organizations. We believe that the British government's refusal to issue visas to forty Soviet representatives is an open and malicious act, targeting not only these forty individuals but also all twelve hundred representatives attending the Second All-Soviet Peace Congress. What are the reasons for this action by the so-called "Labor" government of the British Labour Party? In our view, this action is integrated with the actions of the American government, which hastily expelled representatives attending the New York Peace Conference in March of last year. This action is the same as the action taken by the French government a year and a half ago, which attempted to sabotage the First World Peace Congress by limiting the number of visas for Soviet and other delegations. On this issue, as on many other issues, the American warmongers have found docile and trained imitators among the so-called "Labor" leaders in the British cabinet, who are afraid of peace fighters and eager to flatter their American masters (they have become accustomed to thinking of Britain as their forty-ninth state). This is the reason for the British government's attitude towards the Soviet people.

What will be the consequences of this action?

First, the British Labour Party government, through its clumsy attempt to sabotage the Third World Peace Congress, has once again openly exposed itself as a government hostile to the cause of peace in front of all honest people in the world.

Second, peace fighters around the world, just as they did a year and a half ago when the French government unreasonably prevented entry, will raise the banner of the struggle for peace even higher, and will tell the warmongers more loudly and indignantly: No! You cannot incite war, no matter what conspiracies you use, no matter what obstacles you place in the wheels, peace will triumph over war!

The All-Soviet Peace Committee absolutely and resolutely insists that Britain issue visas to the members of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, to the writers Fadeyev and Ehrenburg, to Archbishop Nikolai of Krutitsy, to academicians Nesmeyanov and Volgin, to composer Shostakovich, and to Tikhonov, the chairman of the All-Soviet Peace Committee.

Oparin said:

Refusal of Visas Cannot Stop the Dissemination of Scientific Truth; The Need for Peace is a Well-Known Truth

Academician Oparin said in his speech: I cannot but express my utmost astonishment at Britain's refusal to issue me a visa. According to long-established international practice, scientists from all countries always maintain broad contact through publications, individual private visits, or attending conferences and meetings. The issue of peace, the issue of establishing conditions to eliminate the possibility of new worldwide massacres, undoubtedly stirs the vast scientific community around the world. Genuine and sincere scientists are not indifferent to the question of how to use the fruits of their contributed wisdom and creative efforts, and for what purpose these fruits serve. His conscience will never allow him to stand idly by and see his work used—against his original wishes—to destroy completely innocent people. Therefore, all honest scientists, regardless of their nationality and political beliefs, want to meet with other scientists and other cultural leaders to discuss concrete ways to defend peace. This desire is very obvious and legitimate. Scientists from all fields will have much to contribute to peace!

My specialty is biology—the science of life, and my work in this area is well-known to people in some countries outside the Soviet Union. In particular, I have many papers and books published in English. In conducting scientific research, I not only strive to understand the essence of life, but I also explore some ways to harness the living world for the well-being of mankind. From the writings of me and my colleagues, it can be seen that the living world contains such enormous possibilities that, if properly utilized, they will meet the needs of the people of the world. If I openly publish my views on peace and some of the facts I have at my disposal to scientists and people in other countries, then to whom would this be harmful? Only to those who want to use the demons of poverty and hunger to scare ordinary people, these people want to absurdly instill in them the idea that the earth cannot feed all of humanity, so they must kill their compatriots in war in order to live themselves. However, it is ridiculous to think that refusing visas can prevent the dissemination of scientific truth. It is well known that truth knows no boundaries and does not require a visa, and especially such a great and well-known truth: that is, mankind needs peace, peace, and thirdly, peace!

Lebezheva said:

The British Government's Refusal to Issue Visas to Soviet Representatives Will Inevitably Arouse the Anger of People Around the World

Lebezheva, Director of the Central Tuberculosis Research Institute, said in her speech: The news that I was denied a visa made me feel very puzzled. If I say that the British government—this refusal to issue entry visas to forty Soviet representatives will inevitably arouse the anger of people around the world, I don't think I would be wrong. I am not just talking about myself. I am one of many representatives who are being deprived of the possibility of going to Sheffield. As a mother and scientific worker, am I dangerous to the British Labour Party government? Obviously, I am dangerous because, starting from a medical nurse, I have become a doctor, a scientific worker, a candidate academician of the Academy of Medical Sciences, and the director of a tuberculosis prevention research institute under Soviet living conditions. My path is a typical path for the people of socialist countries, and this is the great strength of socialist countries. And this is indeed what the British Labour Party government fears. It fears that the Soviet people will speak the truth about peace at the conference, and it fears that the British people will harbor warm sympathy for the Soviet people. As for the British people, I deeply believe that they are willing to see advanced Soviet people among the representatives attending the conference, willing to see these advanced Soviet people who prove the power and correctness of the idea of peace with their entire lives and labor.

Shostakovich said:

The British Government's Ban Shows Its Opposition to Peace and Fear of the Consolidation of Friendship Between the British and Soviet Peoples

Composer Shostakovich said in his speech: The British government has prevented a large number of Soviet representatives from going to Britain to attend the Second World Peace Congress, and I am one of them. This is the second time in my life that I have been given such "hospitality." Last year, I attended the New York Peace Conference in the United States. After the conference ended, I intended to attend several concerts of my works, but the American government asked me to leave the United States. Before I went to Britain, people had invited me to perform my works on the radio and at concerts. But at that time, the British government outdid its American accomplices in terms of hospitality: it simply refused me entry into British territory. Now I intend to go to Britain as a member of the Soviet delegation. In addition, I also intend to happily appear before the British people with my works. But the British government has refused to let me enter Britain, which shows that it opposes composer Shostakovich going to Britain as a representative to the World Peace Congress. The two Shostakovichs—the composer and the representative of the Soviet Peace Committee, are one person! Both are striving for peace. But the British government has already shown with its ban that it is against peace, that it fears communication between cultural workers, and that it fears the consolidation of friendship between the British and Soviet peoples. However, the police and bans will not enable the British government to stop the powerful movement for the struggle for peace.

Archbishop Nikolai said:

The British Government Ridicules Christian Doctrines, and I, Along With All the People of the Soviet Union, Denounce It

Archbishop Nikolai of Krutitsy and Kolomna said in his speech: I am a bishop of the Russian Orthodox Church, which, in the name of the Christian doctrines it proclaims, is fighting for peace together with all peace-loving humanity. What will I say in Sheffield? Naturally, I will talk about peace. I will say that defending peace is the sacred responsibility of every Christian: this is what religious conscience requires, this is what the ideal of brotherhood within the four seas requires of us. I will speak as a representative of a Christian, an Orthodox Church. Why is the British government afraid and refuses to issue me a visa? This country believes that it is Christian, and there, the church, which is inextricably linked to the state, preaches the same doctrines as us. What is the purpose of the government of this country in doing this?

Some representatives of capitalist countries have repeatedly declared: they have a responsibility to defend the "Christian" civilization, the kind of culture that does not allow imagined enemies to invade. But the British government is attempting to destroy the cause of defending peace, and is preventing peace-loving people from gathering together to discuss the most humane and sublime questions for expelling the demon of war. In this way, the British government ridicules Christian doctrines, and precisely shows once again that the so-called saving "Christian civilization" is completely false.

I express my anger and denunciation to the British authorities in unison with all the people of the Soviet Union. I firmly believe that in response to the plots to obstruct the cause of peace, peace-loving humanity around the world will more forcefully and more unitedly carry out the struggle for peace to ensure that peace triumphs over war. The shameful struggle against peace will be condemned by the world's true Christians as a manifestation of demonic malice.

Chirkasov said:

The Voice of Peace Fighters Will Not Be Stifled; The British Government Has Exposed Its True Colors to the People

Soviet People's Artist Chirkasov said in his speech: The people of Leningrad elected me to attend the Second All-Soviet Peace Congress, and the congress elected me to be a representative to the Second World Peace Congress.

The heroic city of Leningrad knows what war is like, and instructed me to loudly express its desire for peace and international friendship. But the British Labour Party government is unwilling to give me this possibility, although we peace fighters are the most peace-loving people, although it has no reason to fear us. I do not at all think that the British people, whom we sincerely respect, will be afraid of us.

The British people gave us Shakespeare, Byron, Shelley, Shaw... many things in our theatrical life are related to their names. For example, now that I have left Leningrad, I have to put a stop to the research work on Malvolio, a character in Shakespeare's comedy "Twelfth Night," which will soon be staged at the oldest Pushkin Theater in the Soviet Union. I know that the voice of peace fighters will not be stifled. This voice will receive an equally strong echo in any place on our earth, because this is the voice of truth, this is the voice of all working humanity. I firmly believe that this unfriendly act by the British Labour Party government will expose its true colors to the British people.

Tumanova said:

The Growth of the Peace Movement Has Made the British Government So Afraid That It Even Fears the Voices of Soviet Children

Tumanova, editor of Pioneer Truth, said in her speech: I learned today that the British government has refused to issue me an entry visa to Britain. I edit Pioneer Truth, and our readers are children aged seven to thirteen. What topics do we talk to them about? What do they say in their newspapers? We tell our readers the freshest things, new life, friendship and peace between all peoples. Soviet children all hope to become builders and creators. I think it is the greatest happiness to educate Soviet children with these noble qualities by editing children's newspapers, these qualities make children happy in life.

The question arises: how can a person who is completely engaged in peaceful labor and works among children be dangerous to Britain? Even Britain's greatest satirist, Swift, could not have come up with a more ridiculous reason. I am sure that refusing to issue us visas does not reflect the will of the British people. This decision is against their will, the British government must have great fear of the growth of the peace movement, so much so that it even fears the voices of Soviet children; this is not something adults should do.

Gerasimov said:

The Movement to Fight for Peace is Invincible; The British Government Cannot Stop This Movement

Famous film director Gerasimov said: Last year, we were invited to the United States to attend the New York Peace Conference. My friends and I accepted this invitation and embarked on a tiring journey across the ocean in order to tell our American friends about our determination to spare no effort in the great cause of defending world peace. As soon as I arrived in the United States, I was given the "hospitality" typical of the United States. Now, forty Soviet representatives attending the Second World Peace Congress in Sheffield have been refused visas to go to Britain. This naturally leads to the conclusion that everyone who strives to defend peace with words and deeds is a terrible danger to the political leaders of the United States and Britain. But we must declare: the British government, which has now openly disgraced itself, cannot stop the people's movement to fight for peace, because this movement is a truly people's movement and is an invincible movement.

As a Soviet film director, I want to work with my friends to strive to serve the cause of peace with our work, to serve the cause of mutual understanding and friendship between nations. I know the great power of our art. I will spare no effort to do my best to relentlessly expose the hatred and despicable cruelty, hypocrisy and lies of the aggressors and inciters of new wars against humanity in films, in order to consolidate the people's confidence in their own strength, and their confidence that the struggle for world peace and the happiness and prosperity of working humanity will surely be victorious.

Simonov answers questions:

The British Government Cannot Give Any Reason for Refusing to Issue Visas to Soviet Representatives

After the speech, Simonov answered many questions, including the following:

Q: What is the situation regarding the entry of French and Italian delegations into Britain?

A: According to current general rules, French and Italians have the right to enter Britain without a visa. However, it is not yet known whether the British authorities will apply this rule to peace advocates. In any case, there is already a precedent, namely the incident of Raphael, the Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, who is French and should have the right to enter Britain without a visa, but he was recently detained for several hours at London Airport and later sent back to France. Obviously, when it comes to the peace movement, the British government never considers itself obligated to abide by the general rules it has made with its own hands.

Q: If the British government actually refuses to issue visas to Fadeyev and other Soviet members of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, what is the All-Soviet Peace Committee prepared to do?

A: As I have already said, we must resolutely insist that visas be issued to our representatives, especially the members of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress.

Q: Has the British government responded to the Chinese delegation's application?

A: The Chinese delegation has arrived in Moscow on its way to Sheffield. But as far as I know, today is only three days before the opening of the conference, and they have not yet obtained visas. This situation is of course even more strange, especially since they represent 475 million Chinese people.

Q: What explanation did the British government give for its refusal to issue visas to Soviet representatives?

A: No explanation. Obviously, it is difficult for it to come up with any convincing reasons, so the British government decided to refuse without giving any explanation.

　　全苏和平委员会举行记者招待会
    抗议英国政府无理拒发签证指出是献媚美国主子的公开与恶意行为全世界和平斗士将把斗争旗帜举得更高
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十三日电：全苏拥护和平委员会于本月十日就英国政府无理拒发苏联出席第二届世界保卫和平大会的四十位代表入境签证事，举行记者招待会。
    全苏拥护和平委员会委员们、出席第二届世界保卫和平大会的代表们以及外国和苏联报界的代表，都出席了记者招待会。
    全苏拥护和平委员会主席团委员、作家西蒙诺夫代表该会发表声明称：英国政府已拒发当选出席第二届世界保卫和平大会的大多数苏联代表以入境签证。在被拒发签证的四十位代表中，有些不仅是国内，而且是世界知名的人士，他们是科学、文学和艺术界、公共卫生和教育界的著名人士，以及工会和文化宗教团体的代表。我们认为英国政府拒发苏联四十位代表的签证，是一种公开与恶意的行为，这种行为不仅是针对这四十个人，而且是针对着出席第二届全苏拥护和平大会的全体一千二百个代表。英国工党的所谓“劳工”政府的这种行动是基于什么原因呢？照我们看来，这种行动与美国政府的行动是一体的，美国政府在去年三月曾急急忙忙地把出席纽约和平大会的代表们驱逐出境。这种行动和法国政府在一年半以前，企图以限制对苏联及若干其他代表团的签证数目来破坏第一届世界和大的行动是相同的。在这个问题上，就像在其他许多问题上一样，美国战争贩子在英国内阁的所谓“劳工”领袖中找到了驯服的和受过训练的仿效者，害怕和平战士以及竭力献媚美国主子（他们已惯于认为英国是他们的第四十九州），这就是英国政府对苏联人民采取这种态度的原因。
    这种行动的结果将是什么呢？
    第一，英国工党政府由于它破坏第三届世界和大的拙劣企图，从而再度在世界一切正直人民面前公开暴露了它自己确实是敌视和平事业的政府。
    第二，全世界的和平战士，就像一年半前在法国政府无理阻止入境那样，将把为和平而斗争的旗帜举得更高，将更响亮更愤慨地告诉战争贩子们说：不！你们煽动不了战争，不管你们使用什么阴谋，不管你们在车轮上放置什么障碍物，和平必将战胜战争！
    全苏拥护和平委员会绝对坚决主张英国应发签证给世界和大常设委员会的委员，发给作家法捷耶夫及爱伦堡，发给克鲁提齐大主教尼古拉，发给科学院院士涅斯米扬诺夫及沃尔金，发给作曲家萧斯塔科维奇及全苏拥护和平委员会主席吉洪诺夫。
    奥巴林说：
    拒发签证不能阻止科学真理传布人类需要和平是尽人皆知的真理
    科学院院士奥巴林演说称：我对英国拒绝发签证给我，不能不表示最大的惊诧。根据长久建立的国际惯例，一切国家的科学家总是通过印刷品和私人的个别访问或是参加大会和会议来维持广泛的接触的。和平问题，建立消除新的世界性的屠杀的可能性的条件问题，无疑地会激动着全世界广大的科学界。真正的、诚恳的科学家，对于怎样利用自己贡献出来的智慧和创造性的努力的成果问题，以及这种成果为了甚么目的而服务的问题，不是漠不关心的。他的良心决不容许他无动于衷地看到他的工作——在违反他的原愿之下，被利用来毁灭完全无辜的人民。因此，一切诚实的科学家们，不管他们的国籍和政治信仰如何，总想会晤其他科学家以及其他文化界领袖，以便讨论保卫和平的具体方法，这种愿望是十分明显而正当的。各方面的科学家们对于和平是会有很多贡献的！
    我的专长是生物学——生命的科学，我在这方面的工作是为苏联以外的一些国家的人民所熟知的。尤其是我有许多论文和著作是用英文发表的。我在进行科学研究时，不仅努力要了解生命的要义，同时我还探索为人类的幸福掌握有生的自然界的一些方法。从我和我的同事的著作都可看出：有生的自然界蕴藏着如此巨大的可能性，如果好好地加以利用，它们就会满足世界人民的需要。如果我公开地把我关于和平的意见以及我所掌握的一些事实公诸其他国家的科学家与人民，那么这对什么人会有危害呢？只有对那些想要用穷困与饥饿的魔鬼去吓唬普通人民的人们才有危害，这些人们想荒谬地向他们灌输一种思想，说地球不能养活整个人类，因此必须在战争中杀死同胞，为的是使自己可以活着。但是，如果以为用拒发签证的方法就能阻止科学真理的传布，这真是太可笑了。众所周知，真理是不知道畛域的，而且是不需要签证的，而特别是这样的一个伟大的，尽人皆知的真理：那就是人类需要和平，和平，第三个还是和平！
    列别节娃说：
    英国政府拒发苏联代表签证必将激起全世界人民的愤怒
    中央肺病研究所所长列别节娃发言称：我被拒发签证的消息，使我感到十分费解。假若我说，英国政府——这次拒发四十名苏联代表的入境签证必将激起全世界人民的愤怒，我想这句话是不会错的。我不仅谈我自己。我是被剥夺赴设菲尔德的可能性的许多代表中的一个。作为一个母亲与科学工作者的我，对英国工党政府是危险的吗？很显然的，我所以危险，是因为我从一个医药护士开始我的劳动活动后，在苏维埃生活条件下变成了医生，科学工作者、医药科学院的院士候选人和防肺痨科学研究所的所长。我的道路就是社会主义国家人民的典型道路，这就是社会主义国家的伟大力量。而这确实是英国工党政府所害怕的东西。它害怕苏联人民在大会上讲出关于和平的真理，害怕英国人民对苏联人民——抱有热烈的同情。至于说英国人民呢，我深切地相信，他们愿意在参加大会的代表中见到先进的苏联人民的，愿意见到这些以他们全部生活和劳动来证明和平思想的力量和正确性的先进的苏联人民。
    萧斯塔科维奇说：
    英国政府的禁令说明它反对和平并害怕英苏人民之间友谊的巩固
    作曲家萧斯塔科维奇发言称：英国政府已不让大批苏联代表到英国去参加第二届世界保卫和平大会，我是其中的一个。这是我生平第二次遭到这种“款待”。去年我在美国参加纽约和平大会，大会结束以后，我打算参加我的作品的若干演奏会，然而美国政府却要我离开美国。在我赴英国以前，人们曾邀我在无线电台和音乐会上演奏我的作品。而那时英国政府却在款待方面胜过了它的美国同伙：它干脆就拒绝我进入英国国境。现在我打算作为苏联代表团的团员到英国去。此外，我还打算高兴地带着我的作品出现在英国人民面前。但英国政府却已拒绝让我进入英国，这说明它反对作曲家萧斯塔科维奇作为参加世界保卫和平大会的代表到英国去。这两个萧斯塔科维奇——作曲家和苏联保卫和平委员会的代表，是一个人！都是争取和平的。但是英国政府已经以它的禁令说明它是反对和平的，它害怕文化工作者之间的交往，它害怕英国与苏联人民间友谊的巩固。然而，警察和禁令是不会使英国政府能制止为和平而斗争的强大运动的。
    尼古拉大主教说：
    英国政府嘲笑了基督教教义我与苏联全体人民同声斥责
    克鲁提齐和科洛姆纳大主教尼古拉发言称：我是俄罗斯正教教会的主教，俄罗斯正教教会以它所宣讲的基督教义的名义，来和全体爱好和平的人类一道为和平而斗争。我在设菲尔德将说些什么呢？自然我将要谈和平。我将说，保卫和平是每一个基督徒的神圣责任：这是宗教良心所要求的，这是四海之内皆兄弟的理想所要求于我们的。我将以一个基督教，一个正教教会代表的身份来发言。为什么英国政府害怕而且拒绝发我的签证呢？这个国家相信它自己是信仰基督的，而且在那里，和国家牢不可分地联系着的教会，宣讲着和我们相同的教义。这个国家的政府这样做法用意何在呢？
    资本主义国家的一些代表人物曾经再三宣称：他们有责任保卫不使想像中的敌人来侵犯的那种文化，乃是“基督教的”文明。但英国政府却企图摧毁保卫和平的事业，并且阻止爱好和平的人民聚首一堂来讨论为了驱除战争恶魔的最人道最崇高的问题，这样，英国政府嘲笑了基督教的教义，并且恰好再度显示了所谓挽救“基督教文明”的说法完全是虚伪的。
    我与苏联全体人民同声对英国当局表示愤怒和斥责。我坚决相信：为了答复阻挠和平事业的图谋，全世界爱好和平的人类将更有力地、更团结一致地进行争取和平的斗争以保证和平战胜战争。可耻的反对和平的斗争将被全世界的真正的基督徒痛斥为魔鬼般的恶意的表现。
    隙卡索夫说：
    和平战士的呼声是不会被窒息的英政府向人民暴露了它的真面目
    苏联人民艺术家隙卡索夫的发言称：列宁格勒人选我出席第二届全苏拥护和平大会，大会又选我做参加第二届世界保卫和平大会的代表。
    列宁格勒英雄城知道战争是怎样一回事，并且嘱咐我高声说出它要求和平与国际友好的愿望。但是英国的工党政府不愿给我这种可能性，虽然我们和平战士是最爱好和平的人，虽然它没有理由害怕我们。我一点也不认为我们所衷心尊敬的英国人民会害怕我们。
    英国人民给我们莎士比亚、拜伦、雪莱、萧伯纳……，我们的戏剧生活中的许多东西都和他们的名字有关。举例来说，现在我离开了列宁格勒，我就不得不把关于莎士比亚的喜剧《第十二夜》中的人物马乌里奥的研究工作停顿下来，这个戏不久将在苏联的最古老的普式金剧院上演的。我知道和平战士的呼声是不会被窒息的。这一呼声将得到我们地球上的任何地点同样强有力的回响，因为这是真理呼声，这是全体劳动人类的呼声。我深信英国工党政府的这种不友好的行为将使它的真面目在英国人民的面前暴露无遗。
    吐马诺娃说：
    和平运动的壮大使英国政府恐惧以至它甚至害怕苏联孩子的声音
    少先真理报编辑吐马诺娃发表演说称：我今天获悉，英国政府拒绝发给我到英国的入境签证。我编辑少先真理报，我们的读者是七岁到十三岁的儿童。我们对他们所谈的题目是什么呢？他们在他们报纸上所说的是什么呢？我们告诉我们的读者最新鲜的事物、新的生活、各族人民间的友好与和平。苏联儿童都希望成为建设者与创造者。我认为通过编辑儿童报纸来以这些崇高的品质教育苏联儿童是最大的幸福，这些品质使儿童成为生活中的快乐。
    问题就发生了：完全从事和平劳动及在儿童中间工作的人怎么能对英国有危险呢？甚至英国最伟大的讽刺家斯维夫特也不能想出比这更可笑的理由。我确信，拒绝发给我们签证并不能反映英国人民的意志。这个决定是违反他们的意志的，英国政府一定对和平运动的壮大有很大的恐惧，以至它甚至害怕苏联孩子的声音；这不是成年人所应有的事情。
    格拉西莫夫说：
    争取和平运动是不可战胜的英国政府阻止不了这运动的
    著名电影导演格拉西莫夫说：去年，我们应邀赴美国参加纽约和平大会。我的朋友和我接受了这个邀请，踏上了横渡大洋的疲劳的旅途，以便把我们决心在保卫世界和平的伟大事业中不惜作任何努力的决心告诉给我们的美国朋友。我一到美国就受到美国特有的“款待”。现在出席设菲尔德第二届世界保卫和平大会的四十个苏联代表已被拒绝发给去英国的签证。这样就使人自然地得到一个结论：每一个努力以言行去保卫和平的人，对于美国和英国的政治领袖们都是可怕的危险。但是我们必须声明：目前已经公开出丑的英国政府是阻止不了人民争取和平的运动的，因为这个运动是真正人民的运动，并且是不可战胜的运动。
    作为苏联的一个电影导演，我要和我的朋友们努力以我们的工作为和平的事业服务，为国际间互相谅解与友好的事业服务。我知道我们的艺术的巨大的力量。我将不遗余力地尽我的最大努力，在影片上毫不留情地揭露侵略者与新战争的煽动者对人类的仇视与卑鄙的残忍、虚伪与谎言，以巩固人民对于他们自己的力量的信心，以及对于争取全世界和平与劳动人类的幸福与繁荣的斗争必将获胜的信心。
    西蒙诺夫答问：
    对于拒绝发给苏联代表签证英国政府不能说出任何理由
    演讲完毕后，西蒙诺夫答复了许多问题，其中包括下列问题：
    问：关于法国与意大利代表团进入英国的情形如何？
    答：根据现行一般规则，法国人与意大利人有权无须签证进入英国。但是现在还不知道英国当局是否把这项规则施之于和平拥护者。总而言之，现在已有一个先例，即世界和大常设委员会总书记拉斐德的事件，他是法国人，应该有权不用签证进入英国，但最近他在伦敦飞机场被拘留了几个钟头，后来被送回法国。显然，当事情涉及和平运动的时候，英国政府总是不认为它自己有义务遵守它所亲手制订的一般规则。
    问：如果英国政府竟然拒发签证给法捷耶夫和世界和大常委会的其他苏联委员，全苏拥护和平委员会准备怎么办？
    答：正如我已经说过的，我们要坚决主张必须给我们的代表发给签证，特别是世界和大常委会的委员。
    问：英国政府已经答复了中国代表的申请么？
    答：中国代表已在赴设菲尔德的途中到达莫斯科。但据我所知，今天距大会开幕只有三天，他们还没有获得签证。特别是他们代表着四亿七千五百万的中国人民这一事实，这种情形当然是更加奇怪了。
    问：英国政府对于它拒发签证给苏联代表一事，作了什么说明？
    答：没有任何说明。显然，它要想出任何令人信服的理由都是困难的，所以英国政府决定拒绝不作任何说明。
