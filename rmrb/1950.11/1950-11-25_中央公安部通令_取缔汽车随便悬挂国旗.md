　　Central Public Security Department Circular
    Banning the Random Display of National Flags on Cars
    [This Dispatch] The Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government, in order to ban the random display of national flags on cars, has issued the following circular to the Public Security Departments of major administrative regions, the Public Security Bureaus of the five provinces of North China, and the Public Security Bureaus of Beijing and Tianjin:
    The national flag is the symbol of the country, representing the supreme dignity of the People's Republic of China. Recently, it has been discovered that many cars are displaying the national flag casually, which is both unnecessary and extremely unserious. Having received instructions from the Premier of the State Council, it is hereby stipulated as follows: Except for the official vehicles of our diplomatic officials and overseas envoys, which may display the national flag, all other public and private vehicles are strictly prohibited from displaying the national flag. It is hoped that public security organs in various localities will strictly comply with and implement this, and instruct traffic police to strictly inspect and ban such behavior as necessary.
