　　[Tianjin Daily News] Tianjin's literary and art circles held a forum on resisting America and aiding Korea on October 30th. More than 30 people including the heads of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Literary Association, the Drama Association, the Music Association, and the Fine Arts Association, such as A Ying, Lu Li, and Xiao Changhua, participated in the forum. During the discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that the literary and art circles should take immediate action, exert the power of literary and artistic weapons, and use various forms to carry out anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda activities, expose the true face of American imperialism's aggression, and educate the people to fight against American imperialist aggression, aid Korea, defend world peace, and defend the motherland, based on the people's ideological situation.

　　Several Confused Ideas Need Education and Criticism

　　During the discussion, based on general observations, everyone believed that there were three confused ideas among the masses that needed to be educated: First, some people did not have a clear understanding of the aggressive nature of American imperialism and blindly believed in peace, not understanding that American imperialism's aggression was the same as Japan's past aggression, and that it wanted to forcibly occupy Asia and Europe in order to dominate the world. Second, there was blind worship of American material civilization, especially among some intellectuals who had been educated in Britain and the United States. Third, there was an overestimation of the strength of American imperialism. In addition, it was also pointed out that a small number of profiteers and those who had made fortunes from the national crisis disregarded the interests of the people and vainly attempted to speculate and make a fortune in the war.

　　Should Regard Resist-America, Aid-Korea Propaganda as Their Central Task

　　During the discussion, everyone believed that Tianjin's literary and art circles should actively mobilize and regard the anti-American and aid-Korea propaganda work as the central task of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and its affiliated associations. Everyone declared that the broad masses of the Chinese people have confidence in defeating aggression and defending peace because we have the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao, and we have the support of the powerful peace-loving democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union. American imperialism's flaunting its power everywhere is precisely a manifestation of its final decline and frantic struggle. Literary and art workers should use various literary and artistic weapons to strengthen propaganda, so that the masses can recognize the strength of the world's peace-loving people and their national self-esteem, expose the aggressive nature of American imperialism, and hate and despise these murderous beasts. The folk art circles are preparing to create various anti-American and aid-Korea folk arts to perform among the masses. Fine arts workers are preparing to produce comic strips and other magic lantern shows and "foreign films" based on "A History of American Imperialism's Aggression Against China" (written by Liu Danian). Literature, drama, and music workers are also preparing to create concise and combative works to conduct propaganda and education among the masses.

　　Mobilize the Literary and Artistic Army to Launch Propaganda Activities

　　A Ying, Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles, pointed out in his final speech at the meeting that the Tianjin Federation of Literary and Art Circles has 1,000 organized literary and art workers, plus 5,000 to 6,000 scattered literary and art workers. This literary and artistic army should be mobilized immediately, first by conducting ideological education by each association separately, and then organizing all literary and art workers to launch anti-American and aid-Korea, home-defending and country-safeguarding propaganda work.

　　津市文艺界举行座谈会
    动员全市数千文艺工作者展开抗美援朝宣传活动
    【本报讯】据天津日报消息：天津市文学艺术界于十月三十日举行抗美援朝座谈会。参加座谈的有文联、文协、剧协、音协、美协负责人阿英、鲁藜、萧长华等三十余人。在座谈中，大家一致认为：文学艺术界应立即行动起来，发挥文艺武器的力量，运用各种形式，进行反美援朝的宣传活动，揭露美帝侵略的真面目，根据群众思想情况，教育人民为抗击美帝侵略、援助朝鲜、保卫世界和平、保卫祖国而斗争。
    几种糊涂思想需要教育批判
    在座谈中，大家根据一般的观察，认为目前在群众中有这样三种糊涂思想需要进行教育：一、有些人对美帝国主义的侵略本质认识不清，盲目地相信和平，不了解美帝的侵略和日本过去的侵略是一样的，它要想强占亚洲、欧洲，而独霸世界。二、盲目崇拜美国的物质文明，这特别是某些曾受过英美教育的知识分子。三、过高估计美帝的力量。另外，并有人提出有少数奸商及发过国难财的人，他们不顾人民利益，妄想在战争中投机发财。
    应把抗美援朝宣传作为自己中心任务
    在座谈中，大家认为津市文艺界应该积极动员起来，把抗美援朝的宣传工作，作为文联各协的中心任务。大家宣称，我们广大中国人民对打败侵略、保卫和平是有信心的，因为我们有了以毛主席为首的中国共产党的领导，我们有以苏联为首的强大的爱好和平民主力量的支持。美帝到处张牙舞爪，这正是它最后没落和疯狂挣扎的表现。文艺工作者应运用各种文艺的武器，加强宣传，使群众认识到世界爱好和平人民的力量和民族的自尊心，揭露美帝的侵略本质，仇视和卑视这些杀人的野兽。曲艺界准备创作各种抗美援朝的曲艺，在群众中演出。美术工作者准备根据“美帝侵华史”（刘大年著）制作连环画及其他幻灯、洋片。文学、戏剧及音乐工作者也都在准备创作精短和有战斗性的作品，向群众进行宣传教育。
    动员文艺大军展开宣传活动
    津市文联主席阿英同志在会议最后的发言中指出，津市文联有组织的文艺工作者有一千人，再加上分散的文艺工作者共有五、六千人之多，这一支文艺军队应立即动员起来，首先由各协会分别进行思想教育，然后组织一切文艺工作者，展开抗美援朝保家卫国的宣传工作。
