　　The Chinese People Have the Power to Stop Wars of Aggression!
    ——In Commemoration of the 33rd Anniversary of the October Revolution
    Hu Feng
    As soon as the October Revolution was victorious, advanced Chinese people sent warm cheers to it. For example, Sun Yat-sen said that the success of the Russian Revolution was "the hope of mankind." Sun Yat-sen struggled all his life to liberate the Chinese nation from what he called its semi-colonial destiny, but because he could not break through the limitations of the old democracy, he struggled and struggled, failed and failed, and fell into despair. Now, he finally found a way out from the perspective of human history. For example, Lu Xun saw "the dawn of a new century" from the Russian Revolution. Lu Xun, embracing the deep pain of the people who were being devastated and insulted, and with the broad mind of revolutionary humanitarianism, was beginning his Long March, engaging in a life-and-death white-knife bloody battle against the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China. Therefore, he felt the victory of the working people led by the proletariat from the depths of his heart, recognized that it was the victory of "the people with a doctrine," and thus his spiritual warrior's heart was filled with new heat and light. For example, Li Dazhao declared that "the victory of Bolshevism is the victory of the new spirit of common feeling in the minds of all mankind in the 20th century," and believed that the "spirit of social transformation" contained in Bolshevism is "a hope waiting to dawn, forever existing in everyone's heart." He deeply felt this new spirit of social transformation, and immediately moved the hope in "everyone's heart" to social practice, participating in the pioneering communist movement and struggle, and became one of the most brilliant and determined leaders in the early stage, dedicating his life to this ideal.
    Why did the October Revolution have such a great and profound impact on China so quickly?
    Using the deep-rooted feudal system as a tool, imperialism has been invading China for decades. In order to break this invasion, the Chinese people have risen up again and again, but have failed again and again. Now, the October Revolution "helped the advanced elements in China to use the proletarian world view as a tool for observing the fate of the country and re-examining their own problems" ("On the People's Democratic Dictatorship"). The Chinese people learned from the October Revolution that the national invasion or oppression of our nation by capital and imperialism is only an extension of class oppression, an inevitable result of the development of international capitalism, and also an unavoidable result under the domestic feudal rule; if China wants to truly liberate itself from the oppression of imperialism, it can only rely on the struggle of the working people led by the proletariat. In this way, the road of national liberation and the road of liberation of the working people converged, and this is also echoing the struggle of the oppressed classes and oppressed nations around the world. The Chinese people must "take the road of the Russians."
    However, the October Revolution was victorious only after a cruel class struggle, and it was consolidated after a serious war of imperialist intervention. The Chinese people, having found their way ideologically from the October Revolution, also realized more clearly from the October Revolution: what kind of price needs to be paid on the road of actual struggle, and what kind of sentiment needs to be cultivated and maintained.
    Let's talk about the war of intervention. The novel "The Debacle" writes about the shameless intervention and attack by Japanese imperialists on the young Soviet Union and the counterattack of the Soviet people. Levinson's guerrilla team was besieged by the Japanese intervention army again and again. In the end, he himself was left with only nineteen soldiers, but the hero Levinson's heart was not only without failure, but also gratefully thinking that he would surely get a happy and peaceful motherland and countless brave and hardworking people who would sacrifice themselves for their ideals or work hard. Levinson's wish was completely realized. The Japanese intervention army rolled back from the Soviet Union, and during this war, the heroic Soviet Red Army wiped out the heinous Japanese Bushido army from our Northeast and the land of Korea.
    The Chinese people, relying on their steadfastness to their ideals and the continuous growth of their own strength, finally achieved complete victory after passing through a difficult road of struggle, and established the people's motherland. This victory was obtained after passing through the bloody path of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, was obtained after defeating the Japanese invading army with countless sacrifices, and finally was obtained by smashing the vicious conspiracies and strong "aid" of the American imperialists with a giant force that shocked the world.
    Having walked such a road, the Chinese people, on the one hand, cherish their new motherland, cherish the peaceful construction life of our motherland that has already begun, and absolutely will not allow anyone to invade it; on the other hand, due to the experience of the October Revolution and our own experience, they are always vigilant against the imperialists and pay attention to the relationship between every move of the imperialists and the future of our motherland and the future of the present world.
    Therefore, the Chinese people are carrying out the work of defending world peace and opposing wars of aggression with unparalleled sincerity, and will not allow the existence of any conspiracy or situation that hinders world peace, and will not allow the development of any attempt to provoke wars of aggression, let alone in our East, let alone on the border of our motherland!
    The Chinese people know that without world peace, our motherland will not have peace; without peace in the East, our motherland will not have peace. The Chinese people know that our future is inseparable from the future of world peace, and inseparable from the great struggle of the people of the world to defend peace, especially the Eastern neighbors to resist wars of aggression.
    Now, the American imperialists are grabbing Taiwan with one black hand, trying to keep a springboard to reach the mainland of our motherland, and the other black hand is trying to strangle the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, setting up a ladder to our motherland's border. In this corner, world peace has been torn apart, and the flames of aggressive war have been ignited, and this corner is right on the body and side of our motherland!
    The wise Chinese people, who have been tempered by a long process of struggle, understand this situation like the back of their hand, and the heroic Chinese people, who have been tempered by a long process of struggle, absolutely cannot allow this situation to exist and develop.
    Moreover, let the imperialists know that the Chinese people have enough power to carry out and complete this sacred task! After the October Revolution, the wishes represented by Levinson were finally completely realized, and the imperialist intervention army finally had to flee in different directions. Then, today's world situation or historical conditions are ten times and a hundred times more unfavorable for the imperialists. The strength of the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union is much stronger than the aggressive camp, the fatal contradictions of the imperialist system itself are insurmountable, the degree of awakening and the strength of struggle of the people in the imperialist countries and the colonial people are far beyond what was comparable at the time of the October Revolution, and, standing at the forefront is the indomitable Korean people, tempered by more than 40 years of humiliation and hatred. Under such circumstances, the heroic and invincible Chinese people, who account for a quarter of mankind, have issued an order to the American imperialists: Look, great China stands here! Get out of Taiwan! Get out of Korea! If you want to continue to take risks and play with the flames of war of aggression, your devil's hand must be burned and scorched!
    Salute to the heroic Korean people! The people of the world are watching you, and the people of all China are watching you. We painfully see the price you have paid, but we know that you are determined to be prepared to pay more; we see that you have grasped the correct goal, and we are sure that you will reach that goal no matter what price you pay. The Chinese people want to wholeheartedly support you, and the Chinese people want to practically help you. The Chinese people know that your struggle is our struggle! The Chinese people guarantee to you: If the imperialists do not get out quickly, we will definitely stop them with you, break their hands and feet, and bury them in the sea!

　　中国人民有力量制止侵略战争！
    ——并以纪念十月革命三十三周年
    胡风
    十月革命一胜利，先进的中国人就向它发出了热诚的欢呼。例如孙中山，他说，俄国革命的成功是“人类的希望”。孙中山，他为了中华民族从他所说的次殖民地的命运解放出来，奋斗了一生，但由于不能突破旧民主主义的限界，挣扎又挣扎，失败又失败，陷进了绝望里面，现在终于从人类史的远景上找到了生路。例如鲁迅，他从俄国革命看到了“新世纪的曙光”。鲁迅，他抱着被摧残被侮辱的人民的深沉的苦痛，抱着革命的人道主义的博大的胸怀，正在开始他的长征，向半封建、半殖民地的旧中国进行你死我活的白刃血战，所以，他从内心深处感到了无产阶级所领导的劳动人民的胜利，认定了那是“有主义的人民”的胜利，因而他的精神战士的心房充满了新的热力和光明。例如李大钊，他宣称了“布尔塞维主义的胜利就是二十世纪世界人类人人心目中共同感觉的新精神的胜利”，认为布尔塞维主义“所含的社会改造的精神”是“方在待晓的一个希望，永存在人人心中”。他对于这个社会改造的新精神感受得深，因而马上把“人人心中”的希望移到了社会实践，参加了首创的共产主义运动和斗争，成了初期最辉煌最坚决的领导者之一，向这个理想献出了他的生命。
    为什么，十月革命那样快地对我们中国发生了这么大这么深的影响呢？
    利用深厚的封建统治制度作为工具，帝国主义把中国侵略了几十年。为了打破这个侵略，中国人民一再崛起，也一再失败了。现在，十月革命“帮助了中国的先进分子，用无产阶级的宇宙观作为观察国家命运的工具，重新考虑自己的问题”（《毛泽东论人民民主专政》）。中国人民从十月革命懂得了：资本、帝国主义对于我们的民族侵略或压迫，不过是阶级压迫的扩展，是国际资本主义发展的必然结果，也是国内封建主义统治下无可避免的结果；中国要能够真正从帝国主义的压迫下面解放出来，只有依靠以无产阶级为领导的劳苦人民的斗争。这样，民族解放的路和劳动人民解放的路就汇合了起来，而这又是和全世界被压迫阶级、被压迫民族的斗争互相呼应的。中国人民要“走俄国人的路”。
    然而，十月革命是经过了残酷的阶级斗争才取得胜利的，而且，是通过了严重的帝国主义的干涉战争以后才巩固了下来的。中国人民，从十月革命在思想上找到了路，同时，也从十月革命更加认清了：在实际斗争的路上需要付出怎样的代价，需要养成并保持怎样的情操。
    就干涉战争说罢。小说《毁灭》写的是日本帝国主义者对于年轻的苏联的无耻的干涉进攻和苏联人民的反击。莱奋生所领导的游击队受到了日本干涉军一次一次的围攻，最后，连他自己只剩下了十九个战士，但英雄莱奋生的心里不但没有失败，而且感激地想着，一定会得到一个幸福和平的祖国和无数英勇勤劳的、为理想而舍身战斗或全力工作的人民。莱奋生的愿望是完全实现了。日本干涉军从苏联滚了回去，而且，在这次大战中间，英勇的苏联红军把罪恶滔天的日本武士道军队从我们的东北和朝鲜的土地上消灭个干干净净。
    中国人民，凭着对于理想的坚贞和本身力量的不断壮大，通过了艰苦的斗争道路以后，终于得到了完全的胜利，建立了人民的祖国。这个胜利，是通过了国民党反动统治的血路以后得到的，是用无数的牺牲击败了日本侵略军以后得到的，而且，最后是用着震动全世界的巨人力量粉碎了美帝国主义者的恶毒的阴谋和大力的“援助”以后得到的。
    走过了这样的路的中国人民，一方面宝爱自己的新的祖国，宝爱已经开始了的我们祖国的和平建设的生活，绝对不容许谁来加以侵犯；另一方面，由于十月革命的经验又加上我们自己的经验，时时刻刻都警戒着帝国主义者，注意着帝国主义者的一举一动对于我们祖国前途和现世界前途的关系。
    所以，中国人民是用着无比的真诚在进行着保卫世界和平、反对侵略战争的工作的，对于妨碍世界和平的任何阴谋或情况都不能容许它的存在，对于挑起侵略战争的任何尝试都不容许它的发展，更何况是在我们的东方，更何况是在我们祖国的边疆！
    中国人民知道：世界没有和平，我们祖国就不会有和平；东方没有和平，我们祖国就更不会有和平的。中国人民知道：我们的前途和世界和平的前途不可分，和全世界人民保卫和平的、尤其是东方邻邦反抗侵略战争的大斗争不可分。
    现在，美帝国主义者一只黑手抓着台湾，想保留一个达到我们祖国大陆的跳板，另一只黑手想把朝鲜人民共和国捏死，架起一个通向我们祖国边疆的梯子。在这一角上，世界和平被撕破了，侵略的战火已经烧起了，而这一个角却正在我们祖国的身上，身边！
    从长期斗争过程中锻炼出来的智慧的中国人民对于这个情势明白得了如指掌，从长期斗争过程中锻炼出来的英勇的中国人民绝对不能容许这个情势的存在和发展。
    而且，让帝国主义者知道罢：中国人民是有足够的力量去执行而且完成这一个神圣的任务的！在十月革命以后，莱奋生所代表的愿望终于完全实现了，帝国主义的干涉军终于不得不分途逃走，那么，今天的世界局势或历史条件对于帝国主义者更是十倍百倍不利的。以苏联为首的和平阵营的力量是大大强过侵略阵营的，帝国主义体系本身的致命的矛盾是无法克服的，帝国主义者国内的人民和殖民地人民的觉醒程度和斗争力量是远非十月革命当时可比的，而且，站在最前线的是被四十多年的屈辱和仇恨锻炼出来了的、坚韧不屈的朝鲜人民。在这样的情势下面，占人类四分之一的英勇无敌的中国人民向美帝国主义者发出了命令：看一看，伟大的中国站在这里！滚出台湾去！滚出朝鲜去！如果你们还要继续冒险，玩弄侵略战争的火焰，你们的魔手一定要烧断烧焦的！
    向英勇的朝鲜人民致敬！全世界的人民守望着你们，全中国的人民守望着你们。我们沉痛地看到了你们所付出的代价，但我们知道你们有决心准备付出更多的代价；我们看到你们把住了正确的目标，我们确信你们无论付出的怎样的代价也要达到那个目标。中国人民要衷心地声援你们，中国人民要实际的援助你们。中国人民知道：你们的斗争就是我们的斗争！中国人民向你们保证：如果帝国主义者不快些滚出去，我们一定要同你们一起制止它，打断它的手脚，把它葬到海里去！
