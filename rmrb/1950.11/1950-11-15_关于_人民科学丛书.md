	About the "People's Science Series"
	Zhu Zhaoxiang
		(I)
	The "People's Science Series" (published by Tianxia Book Company) is a best-selling set of popular science books currently available. It has been printed in three editions since liberation until May of this year. This fact demonstrates the urgent demand of the people for scientific knowledge after liberation, and therefore makes us feel responsible for seriously evaluating this series of books.
	The "People's Science Series" consists of twelve volumes. According to the publisher's introduction, the original works were written by famous Soviet scholars in response to solicitations from the All-Union Technical Association, the Agricultural Guidance Institute, the General Health Administration, and the All-Union Association for the Popularization of Political and Scientific Knowledge. The content of these twelve books almost covers all departments of basic science, and the selection of content is quite complete and balanced. Arranged according to category, the titles and translators of these twelve books are:
	Astronomy—"The Structure of the Universe" (translated by Liang Xiang)
			"The Earth in the Universe" (translated by Liang Xiang)
			"The History of the Earth" (translated by Liang Xiang)
	Meteorology—"The World of the Air" (translated by Lin Yang)
	Physics—"How Man Conquers Nature" (translated by Shi Zhi)
	Chemistry—"The Change of Matter" (translated by Shui Fu)
	Biology—"The Origin of Life" (translated by Shi Zhi)
			"The Underwater World" (translated by Shi Zhi)
			"The Green of Plants" (translated by Shi Zhi)
	Physiology and Hygiene—"The Story of the Human Body" (translated by Shui Fu)
					"A Mother's Guide" (translated by Meng Chang)
	Linguistics—"How Man Began to Speak" (translated by Shui Fu)
	This series of books is basically written according to the spirit of the 1944 decision of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party "on organizing scientific education and propaganda"; that is, to explain natural phenomena and scientific and technological achievements with materialism, in order to improve the cultural level of the broad working class and overcome the remnants of ignorance, superstition, and prejudice.
	Except for individual books, the series particularly emphasizes that the natural world around us exists truthfully and is constantly moving, changing, and developing according to certain laws. Celestial bodies are moving, matter is changing, and the earth and its organisms are constantly developing and evolving. The authors of the series tell us that there are no miracles in nature, and even the movement of various organs of our human body is based on certain laws. The authors of the series attacked superstitious concepts such as "God created the world" and "the soul dominates the human body" in books such as "The History of the Earth," "The Structure of the Universe," "The Earth in the Universe," "The World of the Air," and "The Story of the Human Body." In "The Green of Plants," the author used simple and popular language to introduce the Michurin-Lysenko doctrine, explaining that the reasons for the development of the external characteristics and internal properties of plants must be found simultaneously in the essence of the seeds and external conditions. Plants change in order to adapt to the constantly changing external conditions. This explains why the leaves of all plants are always green because the change in sunlight is not significant, and it attacks the idealist theory of Weismann-Morgan. This spirit of dialectical materialism mainly runs through the entire series.
	In this series, it is fully illustrated that because humans can understand the laws of motion and change in nature, they can change nature to serve mankind. For example, "How Man Conquers Nature" tells the story of how humans use coal, petroleum, hydropower, wind power, and even atomic energy to serve mankind. Humans use mud to create gleaming airplanes because they understand the properties of bauxite—its laws of change. People fight against the desert, turning it into endless cotton fields, because they have mastered the characteristics of the desert. In "The Change of Matter," the author quotes the chemist as saying: "There is no waste, only raw materials for re-creation." In the hands of chemists, wood becomes white paper, acetic acid, alcohol, bakelite, and rayon; the stinky and dirty waste from coking becomes ink, bakelite, explosives, poison gas, saccharin, and spices. These facts strengthen people's confidence in conquering nature. Throughout this series, it is evident that in the Soviet Union, science is closely integrated with the people. The Soviet people have mastered science and use it to transform nature, change its properties, and serve the interests of all working people.
	In this series, the authors introduce scientific knowledge in conjunction with people's lives and their production practices. Science is originally a product of society. When the authors describe the development of various scientific ideas and the development of various applied technologies, they combine the social development of each era to describe them. For example, reading "How Man Conquers Nature" is like reading a history of social development. Even for superstitious legends, the authors analyze them from the historical viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism and then correct them.
	This series is filled with the patriotism of the Soviet people. The book points out the great contributions of Russian and Soviet scientists since Lomonosov: a series of brilliant names, Mendeleev, Popov, Petrov, Timiryazev, Michurin, Lysenko, etc., and their achievements, specifically demonstrating the great power of Soviet science in the actual work of the Soviet working people.
	In this way, the authors not only introduce the scientific knowledge of various disciplines, but also tell us the scientific way of thinking, and carry out ideological education of the communist world outlook through the popular narration of natural science. This is the excellent ideological quality of Soviet popular science books.
		(II)
	In terms of writing methods, the authors in this series used the following popularization techniques to make the narration of each book extremely vivid, without boring preaching.
	First, from near to far, guide from things familiar to the reader to lively theory. For example, when talking about the flow of air masses, the author first uses the example of the daily life of opening the door in cold weather and cold air entering along the floor to talk about convection. When talking about humidity, the author does not even mention the terms humidity and saturated vapor, but uses the example of drying clothes in cold weather to explain. This kind of writing is actually the so-called writing combined with reality, which is an important feature of popularization. Scientific theory can only be written in conjunction with reality, so that the masses can feel that what is being talked about is closely related to themselves and familiar to them, so that they will be interested in reading it.
	Second, use more metaphors to make the described theories or things more vivid, so that the masses can use things encountered in daily life as a basis for analogy, thus recognizing some abstract and difficult-to-understand principles. For example, in "The Story of the Human Body," the author uses a crane to compare the femur, a spring to compare the spine, and reinforced concrete to explain why the bones can bear weight and resist bending. The author uses the city's tap water and sewage system to represent the circulatory system. The heart is like a large cylinder in a water plant, pumping blood to the large arteries, arterioles, and even capillaries, just like the water from the water plant goes through the main outlet pipe, through the coarse pipes under the street, the thin pipes in the alley to the home. We cannot see the heart, blood vessels, and their functions, this metaphor makes them vivid, which makes it easier for us to understand. For example, in "The Earth in the Universe," in order to refute the absurd claim that the sun revolves around the earth, the author quotes a story saying, "When roasting a duck, is it better for the stove and the entire house to revolve around the duck, or for the duck to revolve on the stove?" This kind of metaphor has great persuasive power.
	Third, use vivid stories to arouse the reader's interest. In "The Origin of Life," the author begins with the story of a group of hunters discovering a mammoth (an extinct ancient animal) on the Siberian prairie to tell how scientists traced the origin of life based on the remains in the strata. The story of the inventor of the microscope observing dental plaque begins to tell the general characteristics of the microbial world. The text of "The Story of the Human Body" begins with a magician performing. In the three astronomy books, the authors interspersed many interesting superstitious myths.
	Fourth, according to the historical development of a certain natural science, narrate from simple to complex, from easy to difficult, so that readers can easily grasp it. Science gradually develops from simple to complex. The beginning is easy to understand, and it becomes more and more difficult later. It is easy to understand if you narrate according to the historical development. "How Man Conquers Nature" is written in this way. Many parts of other books are also written in this way.
	In this series, we not only see the enthusiasm of Soviet scientists for engaging in popular science work for the benefit of the working people, but also realize that their in-depth, simple, and vivid writing style is worth learning.
		(III)
	The original works of this series have the above-mentioned characteristics, but the translation and publishing work of these books is not serious enough.
	There are many illustrations, such as astronomical charts and photos, which are completely black and do not show anything. There are many typos, especially missing words. There are seventeen missing words in "The Structure of the Universe," so it is impossible to understand the true meaning of the sentence in many places, and even form a great error. For example, when the book talks about the movement of the solar system in space, the translation says (page 55 of the original book): "Our solar system is flying towards this direction at a speed of nearly 20 kilometers per second, so every night we are 100 kilometers closer to the white star than yesterday." There is a missing "wan" (ten thousand) here, it should be approaching more than one million kilometers every night. This kind of error is difficult to tolerate in science. On page 23 of the same book, the two sentences "The stronger the gravitational force between objects, the greater the mass of the objects" must be translated backwards, it should be "The greater the mass of the objects, the stronger the gravitational force between objects." For example, on page 63 of "The History of the Earth": absolute zero—minus 273 degrees Celsius, and page 6 of "The Underwater World": the cold in winter reaches 50 to 55 degrees, both missing the words "minus."
	The "white star" mentioned in the above translation should be Vega according to our country's saying. The translator did not translate it or annotate it, so the reader could not obtain a clear concept. There are many similar examples, such as the Herculis constellation (Hercules), the Andromeda constellation (Andromeda), which have been used in our country for a long time, but the translator did not use them.
	Many translations of terms are directly copied from Japanese dictionaries, which are very different from the translations commonly used in our country, such as "酸素" (sanso), "炭酸素" (tansanso), "瓦斯" (gasu), etc. It is also inappropriate to translate the atmosphere into "氛围气" (fenweiqi). This unfamiliar term appeared dozens of times in "The World of the Air." Similar examples include "汽筒" (qitong) (should be cylinder), "折瓣" (zheban) (valve), "关节杵" (guanjiechu) (connecting rod), "曲轴" (quzhou) (crankshaft), "变光器" (bianguangqi) (phototube), etc. (all see "How Man Conquers Nature"). There are several terms that cannot be translated, and two English translations are written there, such as Thermite, Dyvinile (see "The Change of Matter"). This is extremely inappropriate in popular publications.
	There are many translations of terms newly created by the translator, such as "磁性地上" (cixing dishang) (should be magnetic field), "极端的红光" (jiduande hongguang) (infrared), "机械建筑师" (jixie jianzhu shi) (mechanical architect) (?), etc. Such random translation distorts the original specific meaning of these terms. There are also "电汽发动机" (dianqi fadongji) and "电汽马达" (dianqi mada), which both refer to electric motors, but two translations are used. Moreover, these two translations appear in two consecutive sentences.
	This chaotic situation is particularly manifested in the translation of units of measurement. In one place, it is translated as "生的米突" (sheng de mitu), in another place, it is translated as "公分" (gongfen), and in another place, it is translated as "厘米" (limi). It would be understandable if these different translations appeared in two books or two translators. Unfortunately, they appear in the same book, some even on the same page. The worst thing is that it happens in the same sentence. For example, on page 45 of "The Structure of the Universe," it says: If the sun is compared to a luminous body with a diameter of one and a half "厘米" (limi), the earth will be a small speck of dust 15 "公分" (gongfen) away from the sun (general idea). In "The Underwater World" on page 16, when talking about sponges, it says: "太 (?——added by the author, same below) small, some are only a few meter centimeter protrusions, some are a few meters large."
	As for the examples of mistranslation, there are even more. Here are a few more prominent examples:
	"It takes eight seconds for light to fly from the sun to the earth." ("The Structure of the Universe" page 48)
	"It takes about 300 million years for the primitive hominid ape to become modern humans." ("The History of the Earth" page 67)
	"Saturn is much larger than Jupiter in volume" ("The Structure of the Universe" page 33)
	These three examples are only one word difference, and at a glance, they seem to be correct, but they are actually big mistakes.
	For example, "Plants also breathe, inhaling carbon dioxide in the air and expelling oxygen" "Plants breathe carbon dioxide" ("The World of the Air" pages 5 and 21)
	This kind of error is also very big, because the respiration of plants is the same as that of animals, they both inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide, but here it is completely translated backwards.
	The following examples are so wrong that they are simply unreadable:
	"There is current in the atmosphere surrounding the earth"
	"Whether it is the nucleus or the electron, it emits electricity"
	"The power of the electric motor comes from the battery, which is pre-charged in it by a generator."
	"First put the hot steam from the pot into the cylinder, and then put it into cold water to concentrate the steam in the cylinder."
	"The steam must be concentrated once every time the machine rotates" (all see "How Man Conquers Nature")
	In the above examples, the so-called "emission" is probably a mistake for "charged" or "charging." The "concentration" of steam is really hard to imagine, probably meaning "condensation." The "power" in the fourth example should be a mistranslation of "energy"; the same error is seen in many other places, such as page 44 of "How Man Conquers Nature": "The law of conservation and change of force:.........First, one force will become another force, second, force is never created out of nothing, and it will not disappear." This strange law of physics can only cause some confusion. For example, "The Underwater World" page 6 says: "Any body loses as much weight in the water as it is displaced by the water." Archimedes' principle cannot be recognized after such "transformation." Page 21 about the description of hydra, "As soon as the sea waves subside, the hydra opens up like a bud, and strange flowers bloom on the seabed...". This is clearly the situation of sea anemones, but it is mistaken for hydra. Page 22 "Hydra is also called coral insects" This is also wrong, because hydra and coral insects are two different things.
	Let's take a few more outstanding examples:
	"All objects are composed of extremely tiny molecules that cannot be seen by the naked eye... These molecules are called ultramolecules, or atoms. Atoms are smaller than ultramolecules, and each ultramolecule contains several atoms."
	"The nucleus itself also has its own internal structure, which is composed of smaller molecules: hydrogen nuclei and pole nuclei."
	"In order to artificially cause changes in the nucleus, it is necessary (?) to strongly affect (?) the nucleus with something. Scientists use a torrent of rapidly flying ultramolecules to bombard the nucleus. After the flying molecules hit the nucleus, they break it up."
	"Some nuclei of uranium are affected by rapidly flying molecules—poles—and then break, emitting a large amount of energy (?). When a group of atoms is destroyed, molecules fly out of the atoms, and the molecules rush into another group of atoms" (all see "How Man Conquers Nature")
	The translator's set of "Atomic Theory" proposes what molecules, ultramolecules, ultrafine molecules, flying molecules, flying molecules, atoms, poles, pole nuclei, etc., will actually "shatter" all the previously familiar concepts of atoms and molecules.
	There are also many sentences that are stiff and even unreadable. Such as:
	"Air is a hard and also liquid mineral." ("The Change of Matter" page 8)
	"Fill the molten body (?) of green copper salt (?) into a glass bottle, and then put this glass bottle on the way of light." ("The Green of Plants" page 15)
	"But when the force (?) of sunlight becomes work, this force must first be swallowed by the plant." ("The Green of Plants" page 30)
	"The development of human language began with the following facts: people talked in countless languages, and then people had combined the use of sounds and manual language." "The language of sound started very late, and immediately consisted of single words." ("How Man Began to Speak" pages 33, 35)
	"They put the chewed food into the sucking altar to feed the infants." "Many various reasons affect the development of rickets..." "Suffering from rickets, the first few teeth are always slow to be born, sometimes these teeth only appear when they are almost one year old." (See "A Mother's Guide")
	"The iron bar makes it difficult for the mixed reinforced soil to break, while the concrete makes it easy to bend." ("The Story of the Human Body" page 16)
	... The above-mentioned errors are just some of the more obvious ones that the author has seen in a cursory browse; in fact, there are probably more than these errors. From the nature of the above errors, we can imagine that the translators are probably not very familiar with science. They are too unfamiliar with scientific terms and theories, and at the same time, they do not pay enough attention to the correctness required by science. Therefore, we think that Soviet popular science books are extremely needed and extremely welcomed by the Chinese people, and we welcome many translation workers to introduce them; but in order to seek accuracy, it is best for translation workers to cooperate with scientific workers, so that such errors will not occur. For the "People's Science Series," we believe that the published ones should be re-edited by experts.
		(IV)
	Finally, let me say some other opinions about this series of books.
	Among these twelve books, "How Man Began to Speak" highly praises Marr's theory. After Comrade Stalin published "On Marxism in Linguistics," we know that Marr's opposition to the historical comparative school and denial of the kinship of languages are non-Marxist.
	The degree of depth of these twelve books is inconsistent. Books such as "The History of the Earth," "The Change of Matter," "The Green of Plants," and "How Man Began to Speak" require some basic knowledge to be understood. The other books are generally suitable for the current reading of workers and peasants cadres in our country. Except for "A Mother's Guide," which is purely a book introducing knowledge, most of the other books are written as ideological education books, and they can have a certain effect on breaking feudal superstition and establishing a materialistic world outlook in our country. For the workers and peasants in our country's production front, science that is combined with their production tasks and can solve specific problems in a simple and easy to understand way is needed even more.

　　关于“人民科学丛书”
　　朱兆祥
            （一）
    “人民科学丛书”（天下图书公司出版）是目前通俗科学读物中一套畅销的书，解放后到本年五月已印行了三版。这一事实说明了解放后人民对于科学知识的迫切要求，因此也使我们感觉有责任来严肃地评介这一套丛书。
    “人民科学丛书”一共十二册。据出版者的介绍，原著都是苏联的名学者应全苏技术协会、农业指导所、保健总会及全苏政治与科学知识普及协会的征求写作的。这十二册书的内容，几乎包括了基本科学的各个部门，在内容的选择上是相当完整匀称的。按照门类排列，这十二册书的书名和译者是：
    天文学——《宇宙的构造》    （梁香译）
              《地球在宇宙间》  （梁香译）
              《地球的历史》    （梁香译）
    气象学——《空中世界》      （林洋译）
    物理学——《人怎样征服自然》（什之译）
    化  学——《物质的变化》    （水夫译）
    生物学——《生命的起源》    （什之译）
              《水底世界》      （什之译）
              《植物的绿色》    （什之译）
    生理卫生——《人体的故事》    （水夫译）
               《做母亲的指南》  （孟昌译）
    语言学——《人怎样开始讲话》（水夫译）
    这一套丛书，基本上是根据一九四四年联共中央“关于组织科学教育宣传的决议”的精神写作的；即以唯物主义解释自然现象与科学、技术的成就，借以提高广大劳动者阶层的文化水平，并克服愚昧、迷信与偏见的残余。
    除个别书本外，在丛书中都特别强调说明：围绕我们的自然界是真实地存在的，而且按照一定的规律在不断地运动、变化与发展。天体在运行，物质在变化，地球以及其上的生物都在不断发展和演化着。丛书作者告诉我们：自然界是没有什么奇迹的，甚至我们人体各种器官的运动都是根据一定法则的。丛书作者们打击了《神创造世界》，《灵魂主宰人体》等迷信观念，在《地球的历史》，《宇宙的构造》，《地球在宇宙间》，《空中世界》，《人体的故事》等书中都强调了这一点。在《植物的绿色》中，作者用简明而通俗的文字介绍了米丘林——李森科的学说，说明植物的外表特征和内部特性发展的原因必须同时在种子的本质和外界条件中去寻找，植物为了适应不断变化着的外界条件而变化着，这解释了由于太阳光变动不多，因此所有植物的叶子都永远是绿色的原因，并且打击了魏斯曼——摩尔根的唯心学说。在整部业书中主要是贯彻着这种辩证唯物主义的精神的。
    在本丛书中，都充分说明了：由于人类能够认识自然界运动和变化的规律，因此能够改变自然使为人类服务。如《人怎样征服自然》讲述人类怎样利用煤、石油、水力、风力以至原子能为人类服务的故事。人类利用泥土造成银光闪烁的飞机，这是因为人们了解了铁矾土的性能——它的变化规律。人们和沙漠进行斗争，使沙漠变成一望无际的棉地，这是由于人们掌握了沙漠的特性。在《物质的变化》中，作者引用化学家的话说：“没有废物，只有翻造用的原料。”在化学家的手里木头变成了白纸、醋酸、酒精、胶木、人造丝；炼焦所得的又臭又脏的废物变成了油墨、胶木、炸药、毒气、糖精和香料。这些事实增强了人们战胜自然的信心。在本丛书中处处显示出，在苏联，科学是和人民紧密地结合的。苏联的人民掌握了科学用他来改造自然，改变自然的性能，为全体劳动人民的利益服务。
    在本丛书中，作者们介绍科学知识，是与人们的生活，人们的生产实际结合起来讲的。科学本来是社会的产物，作者们在叙述各类科学思想的发展及各种应用技术的发展时，都结合了各时代社会发展的情况来叙述。如读《人怎样征服自然》就像读社会发展史一样。即使对于迷信传说，作者们也是用马列主义的历史观点来分析，再加以纠正的。
    在本丛书中，洋溢着苏联人民的爱国主义精神。书中指出了自罗蒙诺索夫开始的俄国和苏联科学家们的巨大贡献：一串列的光辉的名字，门得雷莱夫、波波夫、彼得洛夫、季米里亚席夫、米丘林、李森科等和他们的劳绩，具体地表现了苏维埃科学在苏联劳动人民实际工作中的伟大力量。
    这样，作者们不但介绍了各个门类的科学知识，而且告诉了我们科学的思想方法，通过自然科学的通俗叙述进行了共产主义世界观的思想教育。这便是苏联的通俗科学读物的优秀的思想素质。
            （二）
    在写作方法上，本丛书中的作者们用了下面几种通俗化的手法，使每一本书的叙述，都极其生动，没有枯燥的说教。
    第一、从近到远，从读者所熟悉的事物引导到活泼的理论。如讲气团的流动，作者便先用冷天开门，冷空气沿地板进来的日常生活的例子来讲对流现象。讲湿度的时候，作者甚至不提出湿度和中和蒸汽这些名词，而用冷天可以晾干衣服的例子来解说。这样的写法，实际上便是所谓结合实际的写法，这是通俗化的重要特点。科学理论只有和实际结合在一起写，才能使群众感觉所谈的和自己休戚相关，为自己所熟悉，这样才有兴趣看下去。
    第二、多用比喻，使所叙述的理论或事物形象化，使群众拿日常生活中遇见的事物作根据去比拟，因而认识某些抽象的不易理解的道理。如在《人体的故事》中，作者用起重机比大腿骨、用弹簧比脊梁骨、用钢筋混凝土来说明为什么骨骼又可吃重又可抵抗弯曲。作者用都市的自来水和污水系统来表示循环系统的情形。心脏好象自来水厂的大啷筒，把血液打到大动脉、支动脉以至微血管，正好像水厂的水从总出水管，经过街道下的粗管子、巷子里的细管子直到家庭里一样。心脏、血管以及它们的功能，我们是不能看到的，这个比喻使它们形象化了，便使我们容易了解。又如《地球在宇宙间》里，为了反驳太阳绕地球旋转的荒谬说法，作者引用一个故事说：“在烤鸭子的时候，是火炉和整所房子绕着鸭子转好，还是鸭子在炉上转好呢？”这样的比喻就有着很大的说服力量。
    第三、用生动的故事来引发读者的兴趣。在《生命的起源》中，作者从一群猎人在西伯利亚草原发现猛犸（一种已灭种的古动物）的故事开始来讲述科学家怎样根据地层中的遗迹去追溯生物的由来。从显微镜发明者观察牙垢的故事开始来讲述微生物世界的一般特性。“人体的故事”的正文是从魔术家卖艺开始的。在三册天文学书中，作者们都穿插了很多有兴趣的迷信神话。
    第四、按照某一门自然科学的历史发展，从简到繁，从易到难的叙述，使读者易于掌握。科学是从简单逐渐发展到复杂的，开始的东西容易懂，到后来愈繁愈难，根据历史发展的情形来叙述便容易懂，《人怎样征服自然》便是这样写的。其他各书中也有很多部分是这样写的。
    在这套丛书中，我们不但看到苏联的科学家为了劳动人民的利益而从事科学普及工作的热情，也使我们觉到他们的深入浅出的、生动的笔法是值得学习的。
            （三）
    本丛书的原著具有上述的种种特色，然而这几册书的翻译和出版工作却是不够认真的。
    有很多插图，比较显著的如天文图和照片，漆黑一团，不知道表现一些什么东西。错字很多，漏了的字特别多。《宇宙的构造》一书中空着地位漏排的字就有十七个，因此很多地方便无法理解句子的真实意义，甚至形成极大的错误。如书上讲到太阳系在空间的运动时，译文说（原书第五五页）：“我们的太阳系以每秒近二十公里的速度向着这一个方向飞行，所以每天晚上我们比昨天更接近白明星一百公里以上。”这里漏了一个“万”字，应该是每晚接近一百万公里以上，这种错误在科学上很难宽容。同书二十三页上“物体之间的引力愈强，物体的质量也就愈大”这两句话一定是译反了，应该是“物体的质量愈大，物体之间的引力也就愈强”。又如《地球的历史》第六三页：绝对零度——摄氏二七三度，及《水中世界》第六页：冬天的寒冷达五十至五十五度，都漏去“零下”二字。
    上述译文所说的“白明星”，照我国的说法应该是织女星，译者没有把它译出来或注出来，叫读者没法获得明确的概念。类似的例子很多，像赫格尔斯星座（武仙座），安德罗梅达星座（仙女座），我国都有沿用很久的译名，译者都没有应用。
    有很多译名是从日本字典上直抄下来的，和我国习用的译名相差很远，如“酸素”，“炭酸素”，“瓦斯”等。把大气译成“氛围气”也很不妥。在《空中世界》一书中这个陌生的名词出现了几十次。类似的例子还有“汽筒”（应该是汽缸），“折瓣”（汽阀），“关节杵”（连杆），“曲轴”（曲拐），变光器（光电管）等等（均见《人怎样征服自然》）。有几个名词译不出来，写了两个英文译名在那边如Ｔｈermite，Ｄｙvinile（见《物质的变化》）这在通俗书刊里，是极不适宜的。
    有很多译名是译者新创的，如“磁性地上”（应该是磁场），“极端的红光”（红外线），“机械建筑师”（？）等，这样胡乱翻译，歪曲了这些名词原有的一定的意义。还有“电汽发动机”，“电汽马达”等，这二者所指的都是电动机，却用了两种译名。而且这两个译名出现在相连的两句上。
    这种紊乱情形特别表现在度量衡单位的翻译上，在一个地方译作“生的米突”，在另一个地方译作“公分”，还有一个地方却译作“厘米”了。如果这些不同的译法出现在两本书上或两个译者，那还说得过去。不幸却出现在同一本书里，有的甚至在同一页上。最糟糕的竟发生在同一句句子里。如“宇宙的构造”第四五页有这样叙述：如果把太阳比作一粒直径一“厘米”半的发光体，地球将是离太阳十五“公分”之外的一粒小灰尘（大意）。在《水底世界》第十六页讲到海绵时说：“太（？——引者所加，下同。）小不一，有的只有几米厘米突，有的有几公尺大。”
    至于错译的例子更多，这里举出几个比较显著的：
    “光从太阳飞到地球上需时八秒钟。”（“宇宙的构造”第四八页）
    “由原始的类人猿变成现代的人，约需花费三亿年的时间”）《地球的历史》第六七页）
    “土星，体积比木星大得多”（《宇宙的构造》第三三页）
    这三例都只是一字之差，粗心一看以为是对的，实际是大错误。
    又象“植物也呼吸，吸进空气中的碳酸气。排除氧”“植物呼吸碳酸素”（《空中世界》第五页和第二十一页）
    这种错误也是很大的，因为植物的呼吸和动物是一样的都是吸进氧气，呼出二氧化碳，这里却完全译反了。
    下面几个例子错得简直使人无法看懂：
    “在围绕着地球的氛围气中，都有电流”
    “无论是原子核或电子都发射着电力”
    “电力马达的力来自蓄电池，预先用发电器发射在里面的。”
    “先把热汽从锅子里放到汽筒里，然后再放进冷水去加浓汽筒里的蒸汽。”
    “机器每转动一次，蒸汽必须加浓一次”（以上均见《人怎样征服自然》）
    上举数例中，所谓“发射”恐是“带电”或“充电”之误。蒸汽的“加浓”实在叫人很难想像，大概是“凝结”的意思。第四例中的“力”当是“能”的误译；在其他各处同样的错误见到还很多，如《人怎样征服自然》第四四页：“力的保持和变化的规律：………第一、一个力会变成另外一种力，第二、力永不是无中生有，并且也不会消灭。”这种奇怪的物理定律是只能起一些混淆的作用的。又如《水底世界》第六页说：“任何身躯在水里都失去它被水所排挤的那么多的重量。”阿基米德原理经如此“改造”便无法使人认得了。第二十一页关于水螅的叙述，“一等海波平息，水螅便像蓓蕾似的张开来，海底便开放了奇花异葩。……”，这明明是海葵的情形，却错成了水螅，第二十二页“水螅一名珊瑚虫”这也是错误的，因为水螅和珊瑚虫是两种东西。
    我们再来举一些太突出的例子：
    “无论什么物体都是由极细小的，肉眼不能看见的分子所组成的。……这种分子叫做极微分子，或者叫做原子。原子比极微分子还要小，每一个极微分子包含几个原子。”
    “原子核的本身也有它自己的内部结构，是从更小的分子所组成的：氢原子核和极子核。”
    “为了人为地引起原子核的变化，必需（？）用什么东西很强烈地去影响（？）原子核。科学家是用一种飞得很快的极微细分子的狂流去射击原子核。飞行的分子打进原子核之后，把原子核打碎。”
    “铀的某些原子核受了迅速飞射的分子——极子——影响之后，便裂破，发射出大量的力（？）来。在一组原子破坏的时候，从原子里飞出分子，分子又冲进另外一组原子”（均见《人怎样征服自然》）
    译者这套《原子理论》所提出来的什么分子、极微分子、极微细分子、飞行的分子、飞射的分子、原子、极子、极子核等等实际上将把人们所曾经熟悉的原子和分子概念全给“击碎”了。
    还有很多句法生硬，甚至没有办法读得懂。如：
    “空气是硬的也同时是液体的矿物。”（《物质的变化》第八页）
    “把绿色盐化铜（？）的溶化体（？）注满在玻璃瓶中，然后再把这玻璃瓶放在光线的途中。”（《植物的绿色》第十五页）
    “但是太阳光的力（？）变成工作的时候，这力必须先被植物吞吃下去。”（《植物的绿色》第三○页）
    “人类语言的发展是始于下列事实：人们用无数种语言谈话，此后人们已经把声音和手头语配合使用。”“音的语言起始得非常迟，马上就由单字构成。”（《人怎样开始讲话》第三三、三五页）
    “她们把咀嚼的食物放到吸乳坛里喂养乳儿。”“许多各种原因影响软骨症的发展……”“患软骨症，头几只牙齿总是迟缓出生，有时候这些牙齿只在将满一岁时才出现。”（见《做母亲的指南》）
    “铁棒使混筋土不易断碎，混凝土则使它易于弯曲。”（《人体的故事》第一六页）
    ……上面所指出的一些错误，仅是笔者在粗略的浏览中所见的一些较明显的；实际上错误恐怕还不止这些。从上列错误的性质来看，我们可以推想译者们大概都不大熟悉科学。他们对于科学的名词和理论未免太生疏，同时他们对于科学所要求的正确性是太不重视了。因此我们想到，苏联的通俗科学读物对于中国人民是极感需要和极受欢迎的，我们欢迎有很多的翻译工作者来介绍；但为了求其精确，最好翻译工作者能和科学工作者合作，这样，才不致发生出这等错误。对于“人民科学丛书”，我们认为应该将已出版的请专家重新校订一下。
            （四）
    最后，再说些有关这一套丛书的其他一些意见。
    这十二册书中，《人怎样开始讲话》一书是很推崇马尔学说的，在斯大林同志发表“论马克思主义在语言学中的问题”后，我们知道书中所说马尔的反对历史比较学派和否认语言的亲属关系是非马克思主义的。
    这十二册书的程度深浅是不一致的。像《地球的历史》、《物质的变化》、《植物的绿色》、《人怎样开始讲话》等还需要一些基础知识才能读得懂，其他各书大体上是适合目前我国的工农干部阅读的。又除《做母亲的指南》是一本纯粹介绍知识的书外，其他各书大多是作为思想教育的书来写的，它们在目前我国，对于破除封建迷信的树立唯物主义世界观等都能有一定的对我国生产战线上的工农群众来说，要和他们生产任务相结合的科学，更多能为他们解决具体问题通俗易懂
