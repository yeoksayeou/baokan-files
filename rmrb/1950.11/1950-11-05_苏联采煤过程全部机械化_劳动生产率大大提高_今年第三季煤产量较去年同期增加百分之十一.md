Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th -- A comprehensive TASS dispatch from Moscow: Coal miners throughout the Soviet Union are working hard to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. As early as the fourth quarter of last year, they had already exceeded the coal production standards for 1950 as stipulated by the Five-Year Plan. The production plan for the third quarter of this year has been exceeded, and coal production has increased by eleven percent compared to the same quarter last year. This year, miners in Donbas and Moscow have increased coal production to three times the pre-war level.

Soviet coal mines have become industrial enterprises with the latest technology and equipment. Now, mining combines, coal plows, coal loading machines, powerful transport vehicles, electric locomotives, and other machines have practically solved the complete mechanization of the coal mining process. This has completely changed the labor of miners and greatly increased labor productivity. From March to June this year, labor productivity increased by thirteen percent compared to the same quarter last year.

The Soviet Ministry of Coal Industry has opened various training classes to teach miners to operate various complex machines. This year, it will train more than 350,000 skilled technicians. The living standards of Soviet miners have been greatly improved, and their average wages have increased to two and a half times the pre-war level. In mining areas such as Kuznetsk, the average wage has reached more than three times the pre-war level.

　　苏联采煤过程全部机械化
    劳动生产率大大提高
    今年第三季煤产量较去年同期增加百分之十一
    【新华社四日讯】综合塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联各地煤矿工人，都在努力提前完成五年计划。早在去年第四季，他们就已超过了五年计划所规定的一九五○年的产煤标准。今年第三季的生产计划已被超过，煤产量较去年同季增加了百分之十一。今年顿巴斯和莫斯科的矿工已把煤产量提高到战前的三倍。
    苏联煤矿已变成有最新技术设备的工业企业。现在，采矿联合机、刨煤机、装煤机、强大的运输车、电气机车及其他机器，实际上已解决了采煤过程的全部机械化。使矿工的劳动完全改观，使劳动生产率大大提高。今年三月到六月，劳动生产率就比去年同季增加了百分之十三。
    苏联煤业部已开办了各种训练班，教授矿工操纵各种复杂的机器，今年将训练出三十五万以上的熟练技工。苏联矿工的生活水平已大为提高，他们的平均工资已增加到战前的两倍半。在库兹涅茨克等矿区，平均工资已达战前的三倍以上。
