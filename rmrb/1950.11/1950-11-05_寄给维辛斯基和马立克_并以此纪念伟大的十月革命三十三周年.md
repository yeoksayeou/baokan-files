　　To Vyshinsky and Malik
　　--And in Commemoration of the Thirty-Third Anniversary of the Great October Revolution
　　Hu Su
　　In U.S. President Truman's dictionary, the interpretation of the word "aggression", translated into Chinese, using a Chinese example, would be: Chiang Kai-shek, with the help of the U.S. government, launched a civil war, and the Chinese people counterattacked for self-defense and liberation, and that is called "aggression". The current situation in Korea is like this: American imperialism helped its lackey, Syngman Rhee, to launch a civil war against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Korean people are fighting for self-defense and national liberation. Truman insisted that the "Republic of Korea" of Syngman Rhee was subjected to "aggression", and using this word, he dispatched the U.S. Navy, Army, and Air Force to fight the Korean people, claiming it was for their "national security". This is a huge joke, a sinful joke, but a bunch of Truman's lackeys insist that this dictionary is top quality!
　　And you, dear Mr. Vyshinsky, you, dear Mr. Malik, you two great cadres of Stalin, good friends of the Chinese and Korean people, at the United Nations meetings, you represent the Soviet Union, in fact, you also represent the will of the people of the world, using truth, using conclusive historical documents—the definition of "aggression" passed by the Security Issues Committee of the League of Nations in May 1933—to correct these two words. You said: When foreign troops go to another country to massacre the people of that country in order to prevent the liberation of the people of that country, that is called aggression. That's right, an absolutely accurate correction! The blood of the Chinese people has not yet dried, the scars have not yet healed, we firmly remember: the evils committed by the Japanese devils! The evils committed by the American devils!
　　In U.S. President Truman's dictionary, the word "peace" cannot be found; he dares not write it, and never will be able to write it! A delegation from the Women's Peace Committee of the Chelsea District of New York, wanting to talk about peace issues, requested a visit to Malik, the Soviet representative to the United Nations, and Mr. Malik received them; they requested a visit to Austin, the U.S. representative, but Austin dared not receive them. What is the reason for this? Truman and Austin and their gang are afraid to talk about peace, just like mice are afraid of seeing the sun! In Truman's dictionary, the page originally printed with the word "peace" was pierced by his own bayonet, and smeared with a lot of bloody blood, human blood! Although Truman and his gang shout "peace and justice" from their mouths, they have a sentence pressed under their tongues: "war and sin"; what they are doing is: killing Korean soldiers, killing Koreans, killing Korean women and children! And also repeatedly sending planes to Northeast China to kill Chinese fishermen and workers!
　　And you, dear Mr. Vyshinsky, you, dear Mr. Malik, you two great cadres of Stalin, good friends of the Chinese and Korean people, at the United Nations meetings, you represent the Soviet Union, in fact, you also represent the will of the people of the world, using truth, using conclusive and present facts, to expose Truman's heart, to take out the sentence pressed under his tongue, and point out the bloody crimes of American imperialism to the whole world. The Chinese people support you, the Korean people support you, and all peace-loving and democratic people in the world support you!
　　Regarding international peace and security—major world affairs—the five major powers, the Soviet Union, China, the United States, Britain, and France, must act in consultation and agreement; absolutely no single country, the United States, can be allowed to manipulate them. You represent the Soviet Union, proposing and insisting on this opinion, very correct, very correct!
　　China is an important member of the United Nations, and the only government that can now represent the 475 million Chinese people and has the power is the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. Representatives sent by our Chairman Mao must be allowed to participate in the various organizations of the United Nations, and Jiang Tingfu, who can only represent a small group of wandering souls, must be expelled from the United Nations. You represent the Soviet Union, proposing and insisting on this opinion, very correct, very correct!
　　Truman ordered Austin to play puppet shows at the United Nations, and actually put together a so-called "majority", but they actually only represent a small street on Wall Street in the United States, a street filled with the stench of money and utter filth, and a small group of lackeys on that street. And you, dear Mr. Vyshinsky and Mr. Malik, you represent countless beautiful streets, solemn streets, solemn cities, heroic cities, heroic villages, quiet fields all over the world; countless majestic and towering mountains; countless exciting rivers rushing—among them are the most surging Volga and Don, Yellow River and Yangtze River! Your voice is the voice of the Volga and Don, the voice of the Yellow River and Yangtze River, it is the voice of the people of the world!
　　The people of the world love peace and oppose war, but we the people are never afraid of war, and firmly believe that, with our own strength, we will forever eliminate the scourge of war from among mankind, and establish a permanent peaceful and happy life.
　　This firm confidence is not bragging, because—
　　On November 7, 1917, on this great morning, a sun that shines on the entire globe rose—the socialist Soviet Union stood up on one-sixth of the world's land, and raised high the banner of Marx—Engels—Lenin—Stalin, after the test of foreign armed intervention and domestic war from 1918 to 1920, after the test of the Great Patriotic War against Germany from 1941 to 1945; after the test of the New Economic Policy and several Five-Year Plans, it has definitely proved the strength of national defense, the strength of economic construction, and the strength of defending world peace! Even imperialists and reactionaries cannot but admit that the Soviet Union is truly a bastion of world peace and democracy. Look at how much they hate it to the bone and tremble with fear!
　　On October 1, 1949, the East also brightened, the sun reddened, and Chairman Mao Zedong announced to the world: the Chinese people, accounting for a quarter of the world's population, have stood up from now on! After the test of the Great Revolution of 1925-1927, after the test of the Ten-Year Land Revolution, especially after the test of the Eight-Year War of Resistance Against Japan and the Three-Year People's Liberation War, we thank the "benevolence" of the Japanese "Emperor", and Truman's loyal transportation captain—Chiang Kai-shek equipped our People's Liberation Army with Japanese-made and American-made weapons. We have a strong army tempered in hundreds of battles, and a vibrant air force and navy; we also have countless militiamen! The People's Republic of China is not to be trifled with!
　　Dear Mr. Vyshinsky and Mr. Malik, please tell Truman, Austin, MacArthur, Marshall, and other shameless great men who are still dreaming: Korea is our neighbor, and if a neighbor's house is robbed, we cannot sit idly by, we cannot let the flames of war burn our foreheads, we care about the fate of the Chinese people, the fate of the Eastern people, and the fate of the world's people, so we must care about the fate of the Korean people!
　　The flames of war will surely burn down Truman's erroneous and sinful dictionary, and what will forever delete the word "aggression" from the dictionary of the new world is the invincible force of world peace and democracy!
　　October 28, 1950

　　寄给维辛斯基和马立克
    ——并以此纪念伟大的十月革命三十三周年
    胡苏
    美国总统杜鲁门的辞典里，“侵略”两个字的解释，翻译成中国话，举个我们中国的例子说，那就是：蒋介石在美国政府的帮助之下发动内战，中国人民为了自卫和解放而反攻过去，这就叫做“侵略”。眼下朝鲜的局势，也就是这样：美国帝国主义帮助它的走狗李承晚，向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国发动了内战，朝鲜人民为了自卫和全国解放而战，杜鲁门硬说：李承晚的“大韩民国”受到了“侵略”，借了这个词，它出动了美国的海、陆、空军去打朝鲜的人民，并且说是为了他们“国家的安全”。这本是天大的笑话，罪恶的笑话，可是，偏偏有一帮子杜鲁门所养活的狐群狗党们硬说这本辞典是牌子货！
    而你，亲爱的维辛斯基先生，你，亲爱的马立克先生，你们这两位伟大的斯大林的干部，我们中国人民朝鲜人民的好朋友，在联合国的会议上，你们代表苏联，其实也代表着全世界人民的意志，用真理，用确凿的历史文件——一九三三年五月国际联盟安全问题委员会所通过的关于“侵略”的定义，把这两个字校正过来了。你们说：外国的军队开到别一个国家里去，为了不让别国的人民解放，而屠杀别国的人民，这才叫做侵略。对呵，千真万确的校正啊！我们中国人民的鲜血还没有干，伤痕还没有平复，我们牢牢地记得：日本鬼子所造的孽啊！美国鬼子所造的孽啊！
    美国总统杜鲁门的辞典里，找不到“和平”两个字，他不敢写上去，也永远写不出来了！美国纽约契尔西亚区妇女和平委员会代表团，想着谈谈和平的问题，要求访问苏联驻联合国的代表马立克，马立克先生接见了；要求访问美国的代表奥斯汀，奥斯汀不敢接见。这是什么道理呢？杜鲁门和奥斯汀这一伙子，怕谈和平，就好比耗子怕见太阳一般哪！在杜鲁门字典里原本印着“和平”二字的一页，被他自己的刺刀给刺破了，上面涂着不少腥血，人的血啊！虽然，杜鲁门这一伙子的嘴里，也喊着“和平呵正义呵”，可是，舌头底下却压着一句话：“战争呵造孽呵”；手里干的是：杀朝鲜兵，杀朝鲜人，杀朝鲜的妇女和儿童！并且还接二连三派飞机到中国的东北来，杀中国的渔夫和工人！
    而你，亲爱的维辛斯基先生，你，亲爱的马立克先生，你们这两位伟大的斯大林的干部，我们中国人民朝鲜人民的好朋友，在联合国的会议上，你们代表苏联，其实也代表着全世界人民的意志，用真理，用确凿的眼前的事实，揭穿了杜鲁门的心，掏出了他舌头底下压着的那句话，向全世界指明了美国帝国主义的血腥罪过。中国人民拥护你们，朝鲜人民拥护你们，全世界一切爱好和平民主的人们拥护你们啊！
    关于国际的和平与安全——世界的大事情，必须由苏、中、美、英、法五大国商量一致来行动，绝对不能让美国一个国家操纵。你们代表着苏联，提出来并且坚持这个意见，非常对，非常对！
    联合国的会员国里边，中国是重要的一份，现在唯一能够代表四亿七千五百万中国人民的、有权力的政府，只有中华人民共和国中央人民政府，一定得让我们毛主席所派的代表去参加联合国的各种组织，一定得把只能代表一小撮游魂的蒋廷黻赶出联合国去。你们代表着苏联，提出来并且坚持这个意见，非常对，非常对！
    杜鲁门叫奥斯汀在联合国玩木偶戏，居然凑成所谓“多数”，但是他们其实只代表美国华尔街小小的一条街，一条铜臭熏天肮脏透鼻的街，和那条街上小小的一撮狗头们。而你们，亲爱的维辛斯基先生和马立克先生，你们是代表全世界千千万万数不清的美丽的街，庄严的街；庄严的城，英雄的城；英雄的乡村，安静的田野；无数雄伟傲岸的高山；无数激动着的江河的奔流——这里面有奔流得最汹涌的伏尔加与顿河，黄河与长江！你们的声音就是伏尔加与顿河的声音，黄河与长江的声音，就是全世界人民的声音！
    全世界人民，是爱好和平反对战争的，但是，我们人民始终不畏惧战争，并且深信，用我们人民自己的力量将在人类中间永远消灭战争这个祸崇，建立起永久的和平幸福的生活。
    这个坚强的信心，不是夸口，因为——
    一九一七年十一月七日，这个伟大的早晨，升起了一轮普照全球的太阳——社会主义的苏联在世界六分之一的土地上站起来了，高高地举起了马克思——恩格斯——列宁——斯大林的旗帜，经过了一九一八——一九二○年外国武装干涉和国内战争的考验，经过了一九四一——一九四五年抗德卫国战争的考验；经过了新经济计划和几个五年计划的考验，确实地证明了国防的力量，经济建设的力量，保卫世界和平的力量！连帝国主义者和反动派们都不能不承认，苏联真正是世界和平民主的堡垒。你看，它们是那样恨之入骨而又吓得发抖！
    一九四九年十月一日，东方也发亮了，太阳红了，毛泽东主席向全世界宣告：占全球人口四分之一的中国人民从此站立起来了！经过了一九二五——一九二七年大革命的考验，经过了十年土地革命的考验，特别是经过了八年抗日战争和三年人民解放战争的考验，我们感谢日本“天皇”的“恩赐”，和杜鲁门忠诚的运输队长——蒋介石把我们人民解放军用日造和美造的武器装备得齐齐整整。我们有百炼成钢的强大的陆军，有生气勃勃的空军与海军；我们更有无数的民兵！中华人民共和国是不可轻侮的呵！
    亲爱的维辛斯基先生和马立克先生，请你转告还在做梦的杜鲁门、奥斯汀、麦克阿瑟、马歇尔等等这些无耻得伟大的老爷们：朝鲜是我们的邻居，邻舍家被盗，我们不能坐看着不管，我们不能让战火烧到我们的脑门上，我们关心中国人民的命运、东方人民的命运、世界人民的命运，所以，我们必须关心朝鲜人民的命运！
    战火必将烧毁杜鲁门这本错误的罪恶的辞典，在新世界的辞典上，永远删掉“侵略”二字的，是世界人民和平民主的永不可战胜的力量！
              一九五○年十月二十八日
