　　The Mighty Fortress of Peace – The Soviet Union
　　He Fang

　　As early as the end of 1947, more than two and a half years ago, Chairman Mao pointed out in his article "The Present Situation and Our Tasks": "The forces of the world's anti-imperialist camp have surpassed the forces of the imperialist camp." And "the socialist Soviet Union, which is crisis-free, developing upward, and loved by the broad masses of people around the world, its power has now surpassed the imperialist United States, which is severely threatened by crises, declining downward, and opposed by the broad masses of people around the world."

　　Over the past three years, this balance of power has undergone, and is still undergoing, tremendous developments and changes that favor the anti-imperialist camp. Due to the victory of the Chinese people, the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, the development of anti-imperialist forces among the people in various capitalist countries, the upsurge of national liberation movements in colonies and semi-colonies, the Soviet Union's exceeding of its post-war five-year plan this year, the achievements of various people's democratic countries in construction, and the rapid development of the world's people's forces against war and for peace as manifested in the peace signature movement, the peace and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union has become more powerful and consolidated than it was three years ago. Conversely, the war and aggression camp headed by US imperialism has suffered a series of defeats in the past three years, and is therefore weaker and more isolated. No matter how frantically the imperialists struggle, they cannot save their destined fate of death.

　　Today, as a fortress of peace and democracy, the Soviet Union is even more powerful due to the completion of the post-war five-year plan. The entire national economy has not only recovered but has also greatly exceeded the pre-war level of 1940. The Soviet Union's ability to heal the enormous wounds brought about by the war in a very short period of time and to advance the country's economic construction by leaps and bounds, using the decisive advantages provided by the socialist economic system, is in itself a great contribution to the world's people's anti-imperialist struggle, a victory for the peace and democratic camp, and a failure for the imperialist aggression camp.

　　As early as 1948, the Soviet Union's total production had already exceeded the total production of 1940 before the war by 18 percent. In 1949, the total industrial output exceeded the pre-war level by 41 percent, and in the first three quarters of this year, it increased by another 21 percent compared to the same period last year. This means that Soviet industry increased its production by one-fifth in one year. This rate of development is beyond the reach of any capitalist country. For example, in 1949, Soviet industrial production was 16.5 times greater than that of Russia in 1913, while Britain and France remained stagnant, hovering around the 1913 level for 35 years. Even the United States, its production is only about twice that of 1913. Moreover, it must be pointed out that the Soviet Union has suffered the wounds of two wars in the thirty years since its founding. If the time spent on recovering from the war wounds is not counted, the Soviet Union has only had fifteen or sixteen years to truly develop its national economy. But the United States, during this period, not only did not have a single enemy soldier set foot on its territory, but also made a fortune in both wars.

　　The superiority of the socialist economic system over capitalism is also reflected in agriculture. Agriculture, which was severely damaged by fascist Germany, had already recovered and exceeded the pre-war level last year, with a total grain output of 7.6 billion poods. And the tractors, automobiles, and agricultural machinery that agriculture received from industry in 1949 were two to three times more than in 1940 before the war. Agricultural mechanization has long been in the forefront of the world. Last year, the Soviet Union's cultivated land area increased by six million hectares, and this year it increased by more than six million hectares. But the United States, due to "overproduction," has signed two decrees in the past year and this year to reduce the cultivated land area, one to reduce the wheat planting area by 17 percent, and the other to reduce the cotton planting area by 30 percent. The contrast between rise and fall is so obvious here again!

　　In addition, contrary to the increase in unemployment, the impoverishment of the working people, inflation, and the decrease in national income in the United States and other capitalist countries, the Soviet Union not only has no unemployment, but also the number of employees is increasing greatly year by year, the living standards of the working people are constantly improving, the prices of daily necessities have been reduced three times since the war, the purchasing power of the ruble has increased, and the national income has increased. All of this has repeatedly proved the strong vitality of the Soviet system.

　　The strength of the Soviet Union is also reflected in the fact that it is already a socialist country that has eliminated classes. The Soviet Union is now the most democratic country in the world. In the Supreme Soviet elections in March of this year, the number of people who voted accounted for 99.98 percent of all voters. Among them, 99.72 percent voted for the candidates of the party and non-party alliance. This shows how united the Soviet people are and how high the prestige of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government is among the people. As Comrade Stalin said: "The Soviet social system is a truly people's system that grows out of the people and is strongly supported by the people, and the Soviet social system is a social organization form with full vitality and very stability."

　　Although the Soviet Union is a multi-ethnic country, this multi-ethnic country does not grow on the basis of a bourgeois system that stimulates national jealousy and national animosity, but on the basis of a Soviet system that cultivates mutual love and close cooperation among the people of all ethnic groups. It brings together the people of all ethnic groups into a powerful, cohesive whole that is interconnected and directed towards a unified goal. Therefore, every pulse of this country makes people feel the strength of the people of this country, the will of its party, the genius of its leader, and the unconquerable vitality of communist youth.

　　The United States and other imperialist countries are completely the opposite: the country is in the hands of a small number of millionaires; the broad masses of working people have no democratic rights; ethnic minorities and people of color are subjected to inhuman treatment; the government and the people are opposed, and the ruling group is extremely isolated among the people; therefore, this national system is fragile and unstable.

　　In the Soviet Union, new people have emerged. They love the socialist motherland, treat labor with a creative attitude, enjoy the right to education, and a broad path of life and a wonderful future are unfolding before them. This is fundamentally different from the United States, which is rife with depravity, corruption, robbery, bribery, slander, and the defilement of human values. In 1949, the Soviet Union's expenditure on national education accounted for 14 percent of the total budget, while the necessary education expenses spent by the United States each year were only equivalent to one day's expenditure on military equipment. People can see that the difference between them is simply like day and night.

　　Based on this economic and social system, the Soviet Union's military strength, its unparalleled strength, can be imagined. But this is no longer an estimate, but has been fully proven by the anti-intervention war and World War II.

　　The Soviet Red Army was born in the battle against the White Army and foreign armed interventionists. The Red Army has shown its power in defending the young Soviet state and repelling foreign armed interventionists. By the time of World War II, the Red Army had become an unparalleled and invincible army in the world.

　　In 1941, German fascists, who had swept across most of Europe and taken advantage of their victorious prestige, launched a "lightning" attack on the Soviet Union with superior forces. At that time, Hitler deployed 157 divisions on the Soviet-German battlefield. Later, it gradually increased, and in the winter of 1942, the German army on the Eastern Front reached 7.5 million. However, the Soviet Red Army not only withstood the German offensive, but also annihilated a large number of enemy personnel and turned itself into a counter-offensive. In the three years of the war alone, 7.8 million German officers and soldiers were annihilated, and huge losses were also suffered in materials, including 70,000 tanks, 60,000 aircraft, and more than 90,000 cannons.

　　World War II also fully demonstrated the incompetence of the armies of Western countries such as Britain, the United States, and France. Just look at the enemy forces resisted and contained by the Eastern and Western Fronts. In 1942, there were 240 fascist divisions on the Eastern Front, while there were only 15 divisions on the Western Front; in 1943, there were 257 divisions on the Eastern Front and 10 divisions on the Western Front; in 1944, this comparison changed slightly due to the opening of the Second Front, but there were still 204 divisions on the Eastern Front, and only 75 divisions on the Western Front. Even so, when the Soviet army had begun its victorious march and was approaching Berlin, they were still afraid of Germany's strength and dared not believe in victory. As everyone knows, when Nazi Germany concentrated a small force to launch a so-called "Rundstedt" counter-offensive against the Anglo-American allied forces on the Western Front, the US and British military panicked and shouted for help. It was only because the Soviet Red Army launched a full-scale offensive in January 1945 that the US and British armies were rescued from the "anxiety" of "losing the initiative." This was acknowledged by Churchill in his telegram to Stalin at the time.

　　This means that fascist Germany was actually defeated by the Soviet Red Army, and the role of the British and American armies in the war was too small. As for Japan's surrender, even the war peddler Chennault had to admit that "the Soviet Union' participation in the war against Japan was the decisive factor in accelerating the end of the war; even if the atomic bomb had not been dropped, the result would have been the same."

　　Speaking of the atomic bomb, the United States has also tried its best to hype it up, trying to use it to intimidate the people of all countries. But since the Soviet Union announced that it possessed the atomic bomb, this atomic blackmail has been completely bankrupt. So the imperialists are talking about the "hydrogen bomb" and other "new weapons" again. However, the final determinant of victory or defeat in war is still people, and in this factor of people, the Soviet Union has an absolute advantage over the United States.

　　Therefore, no matter from which aspect, the socialist Soviet Union is far stronger than US imperialism. And the strength of the Soviet Union has seriously hindered the imperialists' war plans and promoted the cause of the world's people against imperialism. This is why the imperialists extremely hate the Soviet Union and frantically carry out anti-Soviet activities.

　　Now, the imperialist war group is panicked in the face of the powerful peace and democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union. They self-deceptively tout their strength, saying how bad the Soviet Union is. But the people of all countries have not been deceived and intimidated, and they are confidently carrying out the struggle against imperialism. As for the strength of the Soviet Union, no lies can cover it up. Before the Soviet-German war, an argument also prevailed among the Hitler gang and certain reactionary elements in Britain and the United States, saying that the German fascist aggressors were "invincible," and that the Soviet Red Army was like a "colossus with feet of clay," which would collapse at the first blow. But what was the result? The result was that the Soviet Red Army won, and it was German fascism that collapsed.

　　Of course, the imperialists are still desperately expanding their armaments and waging wars of aggression in order to save themselves from death. The aggression launched by US imperialism against Korea, China, and other places is a manifestation of this dying struggle. We Chinese people, for the sake of the security and independence of our motherland, and for the sake of peace and democracy in the Far East and even the whole world, must resolutely resist the aggression of US imperialism and aid the Korean people in their war of resistance. When we know that we have such a powerful ally as the Soviet Union standing with us in the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, this will increase our confidence in victory and strengthen our fighting will a hundredfold.

　　The peace and democratic camp headed by the powerful Soviet Union will surely defeat the aggression of the "paper tiger" US imperialism. If the war group headed by US imperialism dares to launch a third world war, then the entire capitalist system will fail, and the world revolution will achieve final victory. Now is the era of the victory of socialism and democracy, the era of the death of capitalism. "Those who do not believe in communism, we can say, please wait a little longer, history will say its final words to this group of people who lack faith: take them all and stack them into a common hill."

　　强大的和平堡垒—苏联
    贺放
    还在一九四七年末，两年多三年前的时候，毛主席在“目前形势和我们的任务”一文里就已指出：“全世界反帝国主义阵营的力量超过了帝国主义阵营的力量。”而“没有危机的、向上发展的、受到全世界广大人民群众爱护的社会主义的苏联，它的力量，现在就已经超过了被危机严重威胁着的、向下衰落的、受到全世界广大人民群众反对的帝国主义的美国。”
    三年以来，这种力量对比，又经历了，而且还在经历着有利于反帝国主义阵营的巨大发展和变化。由于中国人民的胜利，由于德意志民主共和国的成立，由于各资本主义国家里人民反帝力量的发展，由于殖民地半殖民地民族解放运动的高涨，由于苏联今年将超过完成战后五年计划和各人民民主国家在建设上的成就，由于表现在和平签名运动上的、全世界人民反对战争争取和平的力量的迅速发展，就使以苏联为首的和平民主阵营，较三年前更加强大和更加巩固了。相反地，以美帝国主义为首的战争与侵略阵营，三年来却遭受了一连串的失败，因而是更加衰弱和更加孤立了。不管帝国主义者进行怎样的疯狂挣扎，也挽救不了它注定了的死亡命运。
    在今天，作为和平民主堡垒的苏联，由于战后五年计划的完成，其力量是更加强大了。整个国民经济不但恢复、而且大大超过了战前一九四○年的水平。苏联利用社会主义经济制度所提供的有决定性的优越性，能在极短的时期内，医好战争所带给的巨大创伤，并把国家的经济建设向前推进一大步，这件事情本身，就是对世界人民反帝斗争的伟大贡献，就是和平民主阵营的胜利和帝国主义侵略阵营的失败。
    还在一九四八年时，苏联总生产量就已超过战前一九四○年总生产量的百分之十八。一九四九年，工业总产量超过战前水平达百分之四十一，今年头三季又较去年同期增加百分之二十一。这就是说，苏联工业在一年之内就增加了它生产的五分之一。这种发展速度，是任何资本主义国家所望尘莫及的。譬如说，一九四九年中，苏联工业生产多过一九一三年的俄国十六点五倍，而英、法却在三十五年中始终环绕于一九一三年的水平，保持静止状态。就是美国，其生产量也不过约等于一九一三年的两倍。而且还必须指出，苏联在建国后的三十多年中，曾经过两次战争的创伤。如果把用于恢复战争创伤所花费的时间不算在内，则苏联真正用于发展国民经济的时间，只不过十五六年而已。但美国却在这一时期内，不仅没有一个敌兵踏进它的境内，而且还在两次战争中都发了大财。
    社会主义经济制度之优越于资本主义还表现在农业上。经过法西斯德国严重破坏的农业，在去年就已恢复并超过了战前水平，谷物的总产量已达七十六亿普特。而农业在一九四九年从工业中获得的拖拉机、汽车和农业机器，要比战前一九四○年多两三倍。农业机械化早已跃居世界首位。去年苏联的耕地面积增加了六百万公顷，今年又增加了六百余万公顷。但美国却由于生产“过剩”，在去年和今年由杜鲁门分别签署了两个缩减耕地面积的法令，一个是小麦播种面积缩减百分之十七，一个是棉花耕种面积缩减百分之三十。上升和没落的对照，在这里又是多么的明显！
    此外，与美国等各资本主义国家失业增加、劳动人民生活更加贫困化，通货膨胀、国民收入减少等相反，苏联不但没有失业，而且职工人数在逐年地大量增加，劳动人民的生活水平不断提高，战后曾三次降低日用必需品价格，卢布购买力提高，国民收入增加。所有这些，都一再证明了苏维埃制度的强大的生命力。
    苏联的强大，还表现在它已经是一个消灭了阶级的社会主义国家。苏联是现今世界上最民主的国度。在今年三月的最高苏维埃选举里，投票的人数占全体选民的百分之九九点九八。其中百分之九九点七二投了党与非党联盟候选人的票。这就说明了苏联人民是如何的团结，布尔什维克党和苏联政府在人民中的威信是如何的高。正如斯大林同志所说：“苏维埃社会制度是从人民中间生长起来并受人民极力拥护的真正人民制度，苏维埃社会制度是有充分生命能力和十分稳固的社会组织形式。”
    苏联虽然是个多民族的国家，但这个多民族的国家并不是在激发民族猜忌心和民族恶感的那种资产阶级制度的基础上生长起来，而是在培植着各族人民相互友爱和亲密合作情感的苏维埃制度的基础上成长起来的。它把各族人民汇合成一个相互连结起来的、指向一致目标的、强大的、浑然一体的整体。因而，这个国家脉搏的每一跳动，都会使人感到这个国家人民的力量、它的党的意志、它的领袖的天才，都会感到共产主义青春的不可征服的活力。
    美国以及其他帝国主义国家则完全相反：国家掌握在一小撮百万富翁的手里；广大劳动人民没有丝毫的民主权利；少数民族和有色人种受着非人的待遇；政府和人民是对立的，统治集团在人民中极其孤立；因而这种国家制度是脆弱的，不稳固的。
    在苏联，新的人已经出现了。他们热爱社会主义祖国，以创造的态度对待劳动，享受着教育的权利，在他们的面前展开了生活的广阔的道路和美妙的未来。这和盛行着堕落、腐败、盗匪、贿赂、诽谤、玷污人类价值的美国，是根本不能同日而语的。一九四九年，苏联在国民教育方面的支出，占总预算的百分之十四，而美国每年所用去的必需教育费，却只相当于军备费用一天的支出。人们可以看到，他们之间的区别简直如同白昼与黑夜。
    在这种经济与社会制度基础上的苏联军事力量，其强大无比就可想而知了。但这已经不是什么估计，而是由反干涉战和第二次世界大战所充分证明了的。
    苏联红军是在反对白党与外国武装干涉者的战斗中诞生的。红军在捍卫年轻的苏维埃国家，击退外国武装干涉者的斗争中，就已表现了它的威力。及至第二次世界大战时，红军已是举世无匹、不可战胜的军队了。
    一九四一年，席卷了大半个欧洲的德国法西斯，挟其战胜余威，以优势的兵力向苏联发动了“闪击性”的进攻。当时希特勒投入苏德战场上的兵力达一五七个师团。此后还逐渐增加，一九四二年冬，在东线上的德军就已达七百五十万人。然而，苏联红军不但经得住德国的进攻，而且歼灭了敌人大量的有生力量并使自己转入了反攻。单就战争三年说，德军官兵被歼灭的就有七百八十万人，同时物资上也遭受了巨大的损失，其中包括坦克七万辆，飞机六万架和大炮九万余尊。
    第二次世界大战也充分表现了英、美、法各西方国家军队的无能。只要看看东线与西线所抗拒与牵制的敌军兵力就知道了。一九四二年，东线有法西斯二百四十个师团，西线则只有十五个师团；一九四三年，敌人在东线是二百五十七个师团，西线是十个师团；一九四四年，由于第二战场的开辟，使这种对比稍有变化，但东线还有二百零四个师团，西线也不过是七十五个师团。即使如此，他们在苏军已开始胜利进军且已逼近柏林的时候，还害怕德国的力量，不敢相信胜利。大家知道，当纳粹德国集中了少量兵力对西线英美联军举行了一个所谓“伦斯德特”反攻的时候，美英军方就惊慌失措，大喊救命。只是由于苏联红军在一九四五年一月发动了全线的进攻，美英军队才被从“丧失主动权”的“焦虑”的情况中拯救了出来。这是邱吉尔在当时给斯大林的电报中所承认了的。
    这就是说，法西斯德国实际上是由苏联红军击败的，英美军队在战争中的作用是太小了。至于日本的投降，则连战贩陈纳德也不得不承认，“苏联参加对日战争，是使战争加快结束的决定性的因素；即使原子弹没有投掷，结果也是一样”。
    说到原子弹，美国也曾极力吹嘘，想借此恐吓各国人民。但自从苏联宣布拥有原子弹后，这种原子讹诈就已彻底地破了产。于是帝国主义者又在高谈“氢弹”以及别的“新式武器”了。然而，最后决定战争胜负的终究是人，而在人的这个因素上，苏联比起美国来却是占着绝对的优势。
    所以，不管从那方面讲，社会主义的苏联是远比美帝国主义强大的。而苏联的强大，就严重阻碍了帝国主义的战争计划，推动了全世界人民反帝国主义的事业。这也就是为什么帝国主义者极端仇视苏联并疯狂进行反苏的原因。
    现在，帝国主义的战争集团，在以苏联为首的，强大的和平民主阵营面前惊慌失措。他们自欺欺人地吹嘘他们的力量，把苏联说得如何如何的不行。但是各国人民并没有被欺骗和吓唬住，他们正满怀信心地进行着反对帝国主义的斗争。至于苏联的强大，那是任何谎话也掩盖不了的。苏德战争以前，在希特勒匪帮及英美国内某些反动分子中也流行过一种议论，说德国法西斯侵略者是“不可战胜的”，而苏联红军却像一座“泥脚的巨像”，一遇打击，就会倾倒下去。但结果怎样呢？结果是苏联红军胜利了，倾倒下去的是德国法西斯。
    当然，帝国主义者为了挽救自己的死亡，还在拚命地扩充军备、进行侵略战争。美帝国主义对朝鲜、中国等地所发动的侵略，正是这种垂死挣扎的表现。我们中国人民，为了自己祖国的安全和独立，为了远东以至全世界的和平与民主，不能不坚决起来反抗美帝国主义的侵略，援助朝鲜抗战的人民。当我们在抗美援朝的斗争中，知道有苏联这样的强大盟友和我们站在一起，这就会百倍地提高我们的胜利信心，增强我们的战斗意志。
    以强大的苏联为首的和平民主阵营，一定能够打败“纸老虎”美帝国主义的侵略。如果以美帝为首的战争集团，胆敢发动第三次世界大战，那么失败的就将是整个资本主义制度，而全世界的革命将获得最后胜利。现在是社会主义与民主主义胜利的时代，是资本主义死亡的时代。“谁不相信共产主义，我们可以说，请再等一下，历史将对这班缺乏信仰者说出自己最后的话：统统把他们拿来并叠成一个共同的山丘。”（莫洛托夫）
