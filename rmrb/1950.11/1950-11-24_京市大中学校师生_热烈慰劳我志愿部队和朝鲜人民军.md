[Our Newspaper] The teachers and students of universities and middle schools in Beijing have enthusiastically launched a campaign to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army in their resistance against American aggression and aid to Korea.

　　Many Teachers and Workers Take the Lead in Donating Comfort Items
　　Many school teachers and workers are taking the lead. The Teachers' Union of Normal University delivered a large number of comfort items and letters of sympathy to the Beijing Educational Workers' Union on the 22nd. The Yenching University Labor Union launched a campaign for three hundred comfort bags and five hundred letters of sympathy, and by the 22nd, it had received six hundred and forty-three comfort bags, more than double the original target. Mr. Zhang Youyu signed his name in blood, expressing the close ties between the front and the rear, and adapted the "Liberation Army March" into the "Volunteer Army March" to praise the People's Volunteer Army.
　　The comfort campaign at the Second Girls' Middle School began first among the teachers. They busily made comfort bags and wrote letters of sympathy. Some personally made cotton gloves, while others took apart their own sweaters to knit woolen socks. The workers saved their money and worked together to make a large comfort bag. Female worker Dai Shuqing took time out from her busy work to embroider a sickle and axe on the bag with red thread.
　　Sun Zhuoru, a worker from Yucai Middle School, came from a farm more than twenty miles outside the city to deliver a letter of sympathy to the Korean People's Army and guerrillas. It read: "We poor people have turned over, and the American devils are jealous of our good life and want to hit us again. Brothers, don't be afraid, we are strong, and if necessary, I will fight alongside you to eliminate this bunch of bastards!"
　　The Chongde Middle School Labor Union decided to hold two charity soccer matches for resistance against American aggression and aid to Korea on Saturday and Sunday afternoons of this week and is prepared to carry out anti-American aggression and aid to Korea propaganda at the same time.
　　Writing Letters of Sympathy to Express Concern and Enthusiasm
　　Teachers and students of the Eleventh Middle School began writing letters of sympathy to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the 15th. Class One of Senior High School first issued a challenge, and teachers and students responded enthusiastically. Now, each student has written at least one letter of sympathy, and each teacher has written at least two. Most of the students in the Fourth Division of the Normal University Affiliated High School wrote three letters each, which were written to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the Korean People's Army, and the Korean People's Guerrillas respectively. The fifty students in the "Kim Il-sung Class" of the Fifth Middle School wrote one hundred and fifty letters of sympathy.
　　In these letters, it is very clear how much the teachers and students love and care for the soldiers at the front, and how much they hate the warmongers. These letters are also full of confidence in victory and enthusiastic encouragement.
　　Jian Bozan, a professor at Yenching University, said in a letter to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army: "Your righteous actions have not only changed the situation in Korea but also changed the situation in the world. Forward! We people who remain in the country will support you with practical actions."

　　Sewing Comfort Bags, Making Cotton Gloves, and Eagerly Donating Money and Goods
　　In the upsurge of donating comfort items, a large number of moving deeds appeared. Many students donated rings left by their mothers or commemorating their weddings; donated newly made cotton clothes to the front line, preferring to wear old clothes themselves; and some took out the money sent home to make new cotton clothes.
　　After the third-year students of Hebei Provincial Normal School knew about the news of donating comfort bags, some immediately took off the scarves from their necks. Students who had no cloth or money found some old clothes, tore them apart, washed them, and made them into comfort bags. All fifty-odd students in Class A of the second grade of Youzhen Girls' Middle School guaranteed to make a pair of cotton gloves each. Liu Zijuan took the cotton out of her own cotton trousers to make gloves because she had no money to buy cotton. The Third Girls' Middle School has made more than seven hundred comfort bags, an average of one bag per student in the whole school.

　　Personally Designing Carefully, Wishing an Early Defeat of the American Army
　　Many comfort bags were sewn by the teachers and students themselves. The students were very enthusiastic when making comfort bags. Jiang Xinghui, a student at the Third Girls' Middle School, only slept for one hour one night and continued to work after arriving at school. The third-year students of Hebei Provincial Normal School did not return to the dormitory until late at night.
　　The Fourth Division of the Normal University Affiliated High School attached a similar enthusiastic letter to each comfort bag for the Volunteer Army: You are fighting heroically alongside the Korean People's Army, fully demonstrating the Chinese people's high patriotism and high internationalism. In addition to supporting you with various powerful practical actions and being your backing, we only give you a small gift to express our sincere hearts. We believe that when you use a towel to wipe your sweat, smoke when you are tired, and use a pencil to study, you will think of us, think of all the Chinese people, and further strengthen your courage and determination to fight the enemy bravely.
　　Female students from the Third Girls' Middle School, Hebei Provincial Normal School, and the Women's Affiliated Middle School of Normal University embroidered encouraging words such as "People's Hero," "Fight for Freedom," "Fight for the Motherland," "Drive Away the Aggressors Soon," and "After Receiving, Hope to Kill the Enemy More Heroically and Push the American Imperialists into the Sea!" on the comfort bags. The gloves made by the senior students of the First Girls' Middle School were also embroidered with the words "Heroically Kill the Enemy."
　　In addition to cold-weather items, daily necessities, and letters of sympathy, some comfort bags also included cartoons and pictures. Some students from the Industrial and Commercial Middle School put Mao Zedong's portrait and the Founding Commemorative Medal in the comfort bags. Li Wenyi, a student at Youzhen Girls' Middle School, also put twenty envelopes and some letter paper in the comfort bag so that the soldiers could use them to write back and tell them the news of victory and life at the front.

　　京市大中学校师生
    热烈慰劳我志愿部队和朝鲜人民军
    【本报讯】京市大中学校师生们热烈展开了慰劳中国人民抗美援朝志愿部队和朝鲜人民军的运动。
    不少教师工友带头捐慰劳品
    不少学校的教员工友，走在前头。师大工会二十二日已送交京市教育工会大批慰劳品和慰问信。燕大工会发起的三百个慰问袋和五百封慰问信运动，截至二十二日，已收到慰问袋六百四十三个，超过原定目标一倍以上。张又渔先生用手指鲜血签名，表示前后方血肉相关，并将解放军进行曲改编成志愿军进行曲来歌颂人民志愿部队。
    女二中的慰劳运动是首先在教员中展开的。他们纷纷做慰问袋、写慰问信。有的亲自做棉手套，有的拆了自己的毛衣织成毛线袜。工友们节省下钱来，合力做了一个大慰问袋。女工友戴淑卿在忙碌的工作中，抽空在袋子上用红线绣了一个镰刀斧头。
    育英中学工友孙琢如从二十多里城外农场赶来送来一封给朝鲜人民军和游击队的慰问信。里面写道：“咱们穷人翻身了，美国鬼子看咱过好日子眼红，又想打咱们。兄弟们不要怕，咱们是有力量的，必要时，我和你们并肩作战，消灭这群王八蛋！”
    崇德中学工会决定在本星期六、日下午，举办两场抗美援朝足球义赛。并准备同时进行抗美援朝宣传。
    纷纷写慰问信表示关怀热情
    十一中师生十五日就开始给朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队写慰问信。高一二班首先挑战，师生同学纷纷应战。现在每个同学至少写了一封慰问信，先生每人至少写了两封。师大附中四部大部分同学写了三封，是分别写给中国人民志愿部队、朝鲜人民军、朝鲜人民游击队的。五中“金日成班”的五十位同学写了一百五十封慰问信。
    在这些信里，可以很明显地看出师生们对前方战士们是如何地热爱和关怀；对战争贩子则是如何地痛恨。这些信里，同时充满了胜利的信心和热情的鼓舞。
    燕大教授剪伯赞在给中国人民志愿部队的信上说：“你们的正义行动，不仅改变了朝鲜的局势，也改变了世界的局势。前进啊！我们留在国内的人民将以实际的行动，来支持你们。”
    缝慰问袋做棉手套踊跃捐献款项物品
    在捐献慰劳品的热潮中，出现了大批动人的事迹。不少同学把母亲遗留下来或自己结婚纪念的戒指捐了出来；把新做的棉衣捐给前线，自己宁愿穿旧衣服；有的就把家中寄来做新棉衣的钱拿出来。
    河北省师高三同学知道献慰劳袋的消息后，有人立即从脖子上解下围巾。没布也没钱的同学，就找些旧衣服拆洗做成慰问袋。佑贞女中初二甲全班五十来位同学，保证每人做一付棉手套。刘紫娟同学因没钱买棉花，便抽出自己棉裤中的棉花来絮手套。女三中已做好慰问袋七百余袋，平均全校同学每人一袋。
    亲自动手精心设计预祝早日打垮美军
    好多慰问袋，都是师生们亲手缝起来的。做慰问袋时，同学们热情都非常高。女三中姜醒会同学一夜只睡了一个钟头，到学校后还继续做。河北省师初三同学到深夜还不回宿舍。
    师大附中四部给志愿部队的每个慰问袋里，都附着类似的这样热情的信：你们英勇地与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，充分地表现了中国人民高度的爱国主义和高度的国际主义精神。我们除以各种有力的实际行动支援你们，做你们的后盾外，仅给你们一点小礼物，表表我们热诚的心。我们相信，当你用毛巾揩汗、累了抽烟、用铅笔学习的时候，就会想起我们，想起全中国的人民，而更增强你奋勇杀敌的勇气和决心。
    女三中和河北省师、师大女附中等校女同学都在慰问袋上绣上“人民功臣”、“为自由而战”、“为祖国而战”、“早日打走侵略者”、“收到后，希望更英勇的杀敌，把美帝推下海底！”等鼓舞的语句。女一中高三同学做的手套上也都绣着“英勇杀敌”的字样。
    慰劳袋里，除了御寒物、日用品、慰问信等，有的还附上漫画、图片。工商中学有的同学把毛主席像和开国纪念章装在慰劳袋里。佑贞女中李文仪同学在慰问袋中还放了二十个信封及一些信纸，让战士们用来写回信，告诉她们前方胜利的消息及生活情形。
