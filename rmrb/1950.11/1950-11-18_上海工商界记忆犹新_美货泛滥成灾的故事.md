　　Shanghai Business Community Still Freshly Remembers
    The Story of American Goods Flooding the Market

　　After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, American goods poured in, and cotton, cigarettes, foreign wine, milk powder, nylon stockings, and glass handbags were dumped cheaply on the Chinese market in large quantities, resulting in the closure of Chinese factories and the loss of jobs for workers. These facts are still fresh in the memory of Shanghai industrialists and businessmen.
　　Who created those disasters? It is necessary to repeat the memories of those traumas. At the same time, the industrial and commercial circles should clearly realize that it is not others who have brought us infinite disasters, but our greatest enemy now—American imperialism.
　　How did the flood of American goods come about?
　　After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the US and Chiang Kai-shek continued to collude and "aid" China with a large amount of surplus materials. Therefore, the United States obtained administrative supervision over the Kuomintang government and strengthened its exploitation of the Chinese people. On February 4, 1946, under the instruction of American imperialism, the Kuomintang government implemented the so-called "foreign exchange policy," and announced the exchange rate as 2,020 yuan of pseudo-legal tender to one US dollar. This exchange rate was obviously low, which was extremely beneficial to the dumping of American goods. On the contrary, it strangled China's material exports. At that time, prices were about 4,000 times higher than before the Anti-Japanese War, while the exchange rate had only increased by about 600 times. Comparing the market price of raw silk in May 1946, we can see the colonial nature of this "foreign exchange policy". At that time, the domestic market price of raw silk was 3.1 million yuan per dan, while the US market price was only 2.5 million yuan when converted into pseudo-legal tender. Adding freight and tariffs, each dan of raw silk would lose half its value if shipped to the United States for sale. China's export trade was irrevocably strangled.
　　The dumping of American goods was all-pervasive and meticulous.
　　Nylon stockings monopolized sales in Shanghai, squeezing many sock factories to the brink of collapse. In June 1946, Shanghai sock factories only operated for three or four hours a day. Even with this reduction in production, it was not enough. As a result, ten large factories, including China, Qinyi, and Fukang, successively stopped work.
　　The popularity of Carnation and Nestle milk powder in Shanghai also overwhelmed Shanghai's milk parlors, and the dairy industry was forced to petition.
　　The cheap dumping of Camel and Chesterfield cigarettes made Shanghai's cigarette factories gasp for breath. In 1946, there were more than 80 cigarette factories in the city, but less than half were operating, and those that were operating were in a state of semi-shutdown.
　　In 1946, there were more than 180 canning and food industries in Shanghai, but only 50 remained the following year.
　　The Da Lun and Yachung wool textile factories also closed down one after another at this time. (Reprinted from Shanghai Xinmin News)

　　上海工商界记忆犹新
    美货泛滥成灾的故事
    抗战胜利后，美货滚滚而来，棉花、香烟、洋酒、奶粉、尼隆丝袜、玻璃皮包等在中国市场大量廉价倾销，结果逼使中国工厂关门，工人失业。这些事实，上海工商业家是记忆犹新的。
    谁制造了那些灾难呢？重复那些创痛的记忆是有着必要的。同时，应该让工商业界明确地认识到：带给我们以无限灾难的不是别人，就是我们现在最大的敌人——美国帝国主义。
    美货泛滥成灾是怎样来的呢？
    抗战胜利后，美蒋继续勾结，把大量剩余物资“援助”中国，因此美国取得了国民党政府行政上的监督权，加强对中国人民的剥削。一九四六年二月四日，国民党政府受了美帝的指使，实行了所谓“外汇政策”，公布汇率为伪法币二、○二○元对美金一元。这个汇率显然是偏低的，这对美国物资的倾销是极有利的，相反的方面，则扼杀了中国的物资出口。那时候的物价较抗战前的物价上涨约四千倍，而汇价只上涨约六百倍。拿一九四六年五月间生丝市价来比较，就知道这种“外汇政策”的殖民地化了。当时，国内生丝市价每担三百十万元，美国市价，折合伪法币仅二百五十万元，再加上运费、关税，每担生丝运往美国销售，就要亏折一半。中国的出口贸易被无可挽救的扼杀了。
    美货的倾销是无孔不入、无微不至的。
    尼隆丝袜在上海独占畅销，把许多袜厂挤翱挎了，一九四六年六月，上海袜厂只每日开工三、四小时，这样减产还不行，结果大型厂中国、勤益、福康等十家都相继停了工。
    克寗、勒吐精奶粉的风行上海，把上海的牛奶棚也压坍，乳牛业被逼着要请愿。
    骆驼牌、吉士牌香烟的廉价倾销，把上海的卷烟厂弄得奄奄一息。一九四六年，全市有八十余家烟厂，开工的还不到半数，而开工的烟厂，都在半停顿的状态下。
    一九四六年上海制罐食品工业本来有一百八十余家，到第二年只剩下五十余家。
    毛织业大纶、亚中毛织厂也在这时候相继关了门。（转载上海新民报）
