　　American "Relief Supplies" Sodium Sulfate is Poisonous
    Two of Our Workers Tragically Died After Taking It
    Central Ministry of Health Notifies All Regions to Immediately Stop Using It
    [Xinhua News Agency, 27th] The Central People's Government Ministry of Health recently notified the health departments of major administrative regions to inform health and medical institutions in all provinces and cities to immediately stop using the sodium sulfate drug from American "relief supplies." The Central People's Government Ministry of Health recently received a report from the Health Department of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee, stating that on September 22nd of this year, Jiang Lin, a worker at the Leizhen section engineering office of the Hengyang Railway Bureau, sought treatment at the Liuzhou Hospital affiliated with the bureau for two days of constipation. The doctor prescribed sodium sulfate (commonly known as Glauber's salt) as a laxative, 20 grams (common dosage is 8 to 30 grams). Unexpectedly, Jiang Lin died on the same day after taking it. Furthermore, a similar situation occurred at the Huangmian Station health clinic of the Hengyang Railway Bureau, where someone also died after taking 15 grams of sodium sulfate. Investigation proved that the sodium sulfate used by the aforementioned medical institutions was from American "UNRRA relief supplies" during the Kuomintang period. After the aforementioned tragedy occurred, Guilin Hospital conducted a detailed test of the drug, and the results showed that the drug was impure and contained sodium fluorosilicate (i.e., silicon fluoride, this substance is not for internal use; a 1/700 solution is used for disinfection, and 1/50 gram can cause prolonged nausea and slow pulse). The sudden death of Jiang Lin and others was a result of poisoning. Therefore, the Central People's Government Ministry of Health has notified its departments to immediately stop using the drug.

　　美“救济物资”硫酸钠有毒
    我两个工人服后不幸暴死    
    中央卫生部通知各地立即停用
    【新华社二十七日讯】中央人民政府卫生部顷通知各大行政区卫生部转知各省市卫生医疗机构，立即停止使用美国“救济物资”中之硫酸钠药品。中央人民政府卫生部最近接得中南军政委员会卫生部的报告，其中说：本年九月二十二日，衡阳铁路管理局耒镇段工程处工友江霖，因为便秘两日到该路局所属柳州医院诊治，当经医师处方通便剂硫酸钠（通称芒硝）二十公分（常用剂量八至三十公分），不料江霖服后当日即死亡。又衡阳铁路管理局黄冕站保健室，亦有因服硫酸钠十五公分而死亡的同样情形发生。据调查证明，上述医疗机关现在所用的硫酸钠，是国民党时期的美国“善后救济物资”。上述惨案发生后，桂林医院已将此项药品加以详密化验，结果证明该药药质不纯，其中含有氟矽酸钠（即矽氟化钠，此物不可内服，七百分之一的溶液做消毒用，五十分之一公分，即可对人引起长时间恶心，并使人脉搏减低）在内。江霖等人服后暴死，即系中毒结果。因此，中央人民政府卫生部已通知所属立即停止使用该药。
