Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 1st: Ya'an dispatch: The Xikang Provincial People's Government convened its first trade conference in early September to discuss local trade work in the province and the trade policy for developing minority ethnic areas.

The main achievements of the province's trade work are the vigorous purchase of local products such as musk, herbs, fritillary bulbs, anemarrhena, and wool from people of all ethnic groups, while supplying tea, needles, thread, native cloth, and other necessities to people of all brotherly ethnic groups at low prices. Trade companies have sold more than 10,000 bolts of cloth in the past six months. Trade organizations have been established successively in Kangding, Luding, Dechang, Linyuan, Yueqiao, Xichang, and other places. Many Tibetans carry medicinal materials and furs from remote mountains to the Kangding Trading Company to exchange for goods. The circulation of Renminbi has also expanded accordingly. Tibetans have requested the local government to add Tibetan script on the back of Renminbi to facilitate identification and use.

Tea is an indispensable beverage for Tibetans every day. With the active support of the local people's government, the production of border tea has also developed. Tea farmers in Ya'an, Tianquan and other places alone have produced more than 400,000 packages of tea this year, exceeding the original production plan of 300,000 packages.

The meeting decided that in the future, in addition to continuing to expand the production of border tea and increasing the exchange ratio of Tibetan products, it will also focus on establishing rural cooperatives, organizing private merchants to go to the countryside, and further expand rural procurement and sales work.

　　西康召开首届贸易会议
    大力收购各民族土产
    提高藏胞土产交换比例
    【新华社重庆一日电】雅安讯：西康省人民政府于九月上旬召开首届贸易会议，讨论该省地方贸易工作及开展少数民族地区的贸易方针。
    该省贸易工作的主要成就是大力收购各民族人民的麝香、药草、贝母、知母、羊毛等土产，同时廉价供应各兄弟民族人民茶叶、针线、土布等必需品。贸易公司半年来已销售布匹一万匹以上。康定、泸定、德昌、临源、越乔、西昌等地，已先后建立了贸易机构。许多藏胞从辽远的深山背着药材、皮毛赶到康定贸易公司来交换物品，人民币流通面也随之扩大，藏胞请求当地政府将人民币背面加印藏文，以便识别行用。
    茶叶是藏胞每日不可缺少的饮料。在当地人民政府的积极扶植下，边茶生产亦有发展。仅雅安、天全等地茶户，今年产茶已达四十万包以上，超过了原定三十万包的生产计划。
    会议决定今后除继续扩大边茶生产，提高藏胞土产交换比例外，并有重点地成立农村合作社，组织私商下乡，进一步展开农村收购与推销工作。
