　　Taiyuan Workers Resolutely Express:
    To Thoroughly Defeat American Imperialist Aggression
    Model Workers Unanimously Call for Production Competition to Strengthen Economic Power
    [Reported by this newspaper] Since October 28th, workers in various factories and mines in Taiyuan have held anti-American symposiums one after another, expressing extreme indignation at the rampant behavior of American planes invading our country's airspace and American troops approaching our border in Korea. Model worker representatives attending the National Model Labor Representative Conference called on all workers to firmly support the just accusation made by our Foreign Minister Zhou to the United Nations on October 26; and to strengthen economic power through an unprecedented scale of production competition to counter American imperialist aggression.
    Wang Guiying, a special-class "Steel Hero" of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, said angrily at the symposium: "If the pig-headed American imperialists dare to stretch into our country's border and destroy our peaceful and happy life, our working class will never let them off easily, we must smash their pig heads to pieces!" After seeing the news in the newspaper that the American imperialists were going to expand the flames of the war of aggression against Korea, Wang Kaishan, the old hero of Taiyuan No. 2 Power Plant, immediately summoned the workers of the repair and maintenance section to discuss it. He called on the workers and said: "We must unite closely to ensure safe power transmission." The workers unanimously expressed that they would work with the old hero to do a good job in production and let the vermin American imperialists taste the iron fists of our working class. Bai Qingshan, a model worker of Taiyuan Machine Factory, resolutely stated in the symposium: "We must support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and Tibet and consolidating our national defense with practical actions of creating more new records and making more contributions." Zhao Xijun, a learning model attending the National Worker-Peasant Education Conference, said: "We must intensify our study, master science and technology, and be more vigilant against the rumors and sabotage of bandits and special agents, and always be vigilant to strike at hidden enemies." Li Jing, a model worker representative of Taiyuan Ordnance Chemical Plant, solemnly pointed out: "We demand peace and oppose war, but we are not afraid of war. Our country has five million powerful People's Liberation Army soldiers, and more than 200 million people have signed their names on the peace book. We have enough power to defeat the aggression of the American imperialists and their lackeys and achieve final victory. Our working class resolutely takes practical actions, under the banner of Chairman Mao, and is not afraid of any difficulties in doing a good job in production, consolidating national defense, and striving to defend the peaceful construction of the motherland and lasting world peace to the end!" Zhang Xiuzhen, a female labor hero of Taiyuan Jinsheng Textile Factory, said solemnly: "I saw with my own eyes in Beijing that our Chinese people have strong naval, land, and air forces. The American imperialist paper tiger can't scare us at all. Wherever it invades, we will eliminate it there. The peaceful and happy life of our working class is absolutely guaranteed. We in the rear must refuel and produce good yarn and cloth to support the front." Wang Zhengyi and other comrades from the Taiyuan Telecommunications Bureau who were transferred from the People's Liberation Army unanimously stated in the symposium: "If the American imperialist young masters dare to invade our country's territory, we will immediately return to the army, pick up our guns and fight these guys, and not let a single one of them escape!" Yang Zengyu, a cashier, said angrily: "I used to blow the bugle call to eliminate the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries. If the American imperialists dare to bully us this time, I will blow the bugle call to eliminate the American devils again." Sixteen thousand construction workers and more than five thousand shop assistants in Taiyuan City said very angrily in their statements: "We are determined to defend our peaceful life. We solemnly warn this mad dog who is seeking his own death: if he dares to invade an inch of our country's territory, we will use picks, steel bars, and all our strength to kill him and tear off his dog skin."

　　太原职工坚决表示
    要彻底打垮美帝侵略
    劳模们一致号召竞赛生产加强经济力量
    【本报讯】太原市各厂矿职工，自十月二十八日以来，纷纷举行反美座谈会，对侵朝美机又多次侵犯我国领空及侵朝美军逼近我国边境的猖狂行为，表示极度愤恨。出席全国劳模代表会议的劳模代表们，号召全体职工坚决拥护我周外长在十月二十六日向联合国提出的正义控诉；并以空前规模的生产竞赛，加强经济力量，回击美帝侵略。
    太原钢铁厂特等“钢铁英雄”王贵英在座谈会上痛恨地说：“美帝这颗猪脑袋，要是敢伸进我国边境，破坏我们和平、幸福的生活，我们工人阶级就绝不能白白放过，非把它这颗猪脑袋打得碎碎的不可！”太原第二发电厂老英雄王凯山在报上看到美帝要扩大侵朝战争火焰的消息以后，马上就召集修配维护股的工友们来讨论，他号召工友们说：“我们要紧紧团结在一起，保证做到安全送电。”工友们都一致表示：要和老英雄一道搞好生产，叫美帝这个臭虫尝尝我们工人阶级的铁拳。太原机器厂劳模白青山在座谈中坚决表示：“我们要以多创新纪录、多立功的实际行动，来支援人民解放军解放台湾和西藏，巩固我们的国防。”出席全国工农教育会议的学习模范赵喜君说：“我们要加紧学习，掌握科学技术，更要严防匪特的造谣破坏，时刻提高警惕，打击暗藏的敌人。”太原兵工化学厂劳模代表李井严正地提出：“我们是要求和平反对战争的，但是绝不害怕战争，我国有五百万强大的人民解放军，有两亿多人民在和平书上签了名，我们有足够的力量打败美帝及其仆从们的侵略，取得最后的胜利。我们工人阶级坚决以实际行动，在毛主席的旗帜下，不怕任何困难搞好生产，巩固国防，为保卫祖国的和平建设和世界的持久和平而奋斗到底！”太原晋生纺织厂女劳动英雄张秀珍庄重地说：“我在北京亲眼看见了我们中国人民强大的海陆空军，美帝这个纸老虎说啥也吓不住我们了，它从那里进犯，我们就把它消灭在那里，我们工人阶级的和平幸福生活是绝对有保障的，我们在后方一定要加油生产好纱布，支援前线。”太原电讯局王振义等由人民解放军转业的同志们在座谈中一致表示：“美帝少爷兵如果真敢侵犯我国领土，我们就立刻回到部队去，拿起枪杆打这些家伙，连一个也不叫它跑掉！”出纳员杨增雨气恨地说：“我曾经吹过消灭日寇和消灭蒋介石反动派的冲锋号，这回美帝洋鬼子要敢欺侮我们，我还要吹消灭美国鬼子的冲锋号。”太原市一万六千名建筑业工人和五千多个店员们，都非常愤恨地在声明中说：“我们决心保卫和平生活，我们严正地警告这条自找死路的疯狗：如果敢于侵犯我国的一寸领土，我们就要用洋镐、钢筋和一切的力量，把它打死，撕掉它的狗皮。”
