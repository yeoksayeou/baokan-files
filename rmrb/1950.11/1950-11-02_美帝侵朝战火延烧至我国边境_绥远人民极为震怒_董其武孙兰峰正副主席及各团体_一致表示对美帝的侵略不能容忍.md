　　American Imperialist War of Aggression in Korea Spreads to Our Border
    People of Suiyuan Extremely Indignant
    Dong Qiwu and Sun Lanfeng, Chairman and Vice-Chairman, and Various Organizations Expressed Unanimous Indignation that American Imperialist Aggression Cannot Be Tolerated.
    [Reported by This Newspaper] American imperialism is frantically extending the war of aggression in Korea to our northeastern border, seriously threatening our national security, and arousing great indignation among the people of all circles in Suiyuan Province. Dong Qiwu and Sun Lanfeng, Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Provincial Government, and various organizations have successively issued written statements, unanimously expressing that they will never ignore this and believe that we must concentrate all our strength to assist the Korean people and defend the sacred territory of our motherland.
    Chairman Dong Qiwu issued a statement saying: American imperialism has repeatedly dispatched aircraft to invade our country's airspace, and has wantonly strafed and bombed. Recently, it has even advanced towards our northeastern border with active military actions. These ironclad facts undoubtedly prove that American imperialism is frantically extending the flames of its war of aggression against Korea to our northeastern border. The people of Suiyuan resolutely support Premier Zhou's speech on National Day: "The Chinese people will never tolerate foreign aggression, nor will they allow the imperialists to wantonly invade their neighbors and stand idly by." We are taking practical actions to strengthen unity, work hard in production, and actively train our troops to increase our strength to resist aggression and consolidate peace, and are ready at any time to accept orders from the Central Government to contribute all our strength to defend our sacred territory.
    Vice-Chairman Sun Lanfeng also issued a statement saying: Regarding the atrocities of the military aircraft of the American invading army repeatedly intruding into the airspace of Liaodong Province, strafing and bombing wantonly, killing and wounding Chinese people and damaging Chinese property, Foreign Minister Zhou has repeatedly protested and accused the United Nations Security Council, but the American imperialist aggression has intensified. This proves that American imperialist ambition is growing. I resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and am willing to make every effort to fight under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao to defend the safety of our territory and defeat any provocations by American imperialism.
    The Provincial Women's Federation Preparatory Committee also pointed out in its statement protesting the American imperialist aggression: In order to safeguard the integrity of the sacred territory of the motherland and the safety of the lives and property of the people across the country, as well as the interests of women and children, Suiyuan women must act quickly, step up production, and take practical actions to crush the American imperialist aggression.
    The delegates to the Guisui City Trade Union Members Congress, representing more than 16,000 workers in the city, issued a statement: We must strengthen unity, increase production, build a strong national defense force, support the People's Liberation Army, defend the sacred territory of the motherland, and safeguard world peace.
    Rong Xiang, a member of the Ethnic Affairs Committee, said in a statement: If the American imperialist snouts dare to stretch into our country's borders, all 300,000 Mongolian compatriots in Guisui will unite closely with the people of the whole country and, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, resolutely eliminate the aggressors.
    Comrade Han Ming of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League said: Suiyuan youth will cherish every inch of our motherland's land with the greatest determination, and at the same time, we have the strength and confidence to defeat any act of aggression by imperialism.

　　美帝侵朝战火延烧至我国边境
    绥远人民极为震怒
    董其武孙兰峰正副主席及各团体
    一致表示对美帝的侵略不能容忍
    【本报讯】美帝国主义疯狂地将侵朝战火延烧至我东北边境，严重威胁我国安全，激起绥远省各界人民极大震怒。省府董其武、孙兰峰正副主席及各团体均纷纷发表书面谈话，一致表示对此决不能置之不理，认为我们要集中一切力量来援助朝鲜人民、保卫祖国的神圣国土。
    董其武主席发表谈话说：美帝国主义派飞机屡次侵犯我国的领空，并肆行扫射与轰炸，最近更以积极的军事行动向我东北边境推进。这些铁的事实，无疑地证明美帝国主义正在疯狂地把侵略朝鲜战争的火焰向我东北边境延烧。全绥远人民坚决拥护周总理国庆日的讲话：“中国人民决不能容忍外国的侵略，也不能听任帝国主义者对自己的邻人肆行侵略而置之不理。”我们正以加紧团结、努力生产、积极整训部队的实际行动，来增加反抗侵略、巩固和平的力量，并随时准备接受中央命令，为保卫我们神圣的国土而贡献一切力量。
    孙兰峰副主席也发表谈话称：关于美国侵略军队的军用飞机，多次侵入我国辽东省领空肆行扫射与轰炸，杀伤中国人民及损坏中国财产的暴行，已迭经我周外长向联合国安全理事会抗议与控诉，但美帝此种侵略暴行反而变本加厉，这证明美帝侵略野心有加无已。我坚决拥护周外长的声明，并愿竭尽一切努力，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，为保卫国土安全，打败美帝任何挑衅而奋斗。
    省妇联筹委会在抗议美帝侵略暴行的声明中亦指出：为保卫祖国神圣领土的完整与全国人民生命财产的安全，以及妇女儿童的利益，绥远妇女要迅速行动起来，加紧生产，以实际行动来粉碎美帝侵略暴行。
    归绥市工会会员代表大会代表全市一万六千多职工，发表声明：要加强团结，提高生产，建设强大的国防力量，支援人民解放军，保卫祖国神圣的国土，维护世界和平。
    民族事务委员会委员荣祥发表谈话称：假如美帝的猪嘴胆敢伸进我们祖国的边境，全归绥三十万蒙古同胞，将和全国人民亲密团结起来，在毛主席领导下，坚决消灭侵略者。
    青年团省工委韩明同志表示：绥远青年将以最大决心，来爱护祖国每一寸土地，同时我们也有力量、有信心来击败帝国主义的任何侵略行为。
