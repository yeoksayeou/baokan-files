Xinhua News Agency, 31st: Commanders and fighters of the East China Military Region, North China Military Region, and the Third Field Army resolutely oppose the US imperialists' expansion of the war of aggression and their insane actions of invading our country's airspace and territorial waters.

Wei Laiguo, a famous shooting hero of the East China Military Region, said: "We must not stand idly by and allow the Korean people to suffer from the aggression of US imperialism, and we must not tolerate the US imperialists' aggression against our sacred motherland. My comrades and I are ready to fight to crush the US imperialists' acts of aggression."

On October 30, the garrison troops of the Shandong Military Region held a symposium of combat heroes and labor models from various units to protest the US planes' aggressive acts of reconnaissance and strafing along the Shandong coast. Wang Zhian, a combat hero of a certain regiment, said: "US imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people. We cannot sit idly by and watch American planes massacre our compatriots." Yu Guijiang, a first-class meritorious soldier who participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Menglianggu Campaign in the People's Liberation War, which annihilated the Kuomintang's 74th Division equipped with American weapons, said: "If US imperialism dares to invade our motherland, I am determined to dedicate everything I have and eliminate the American aggressors with the same bravery with which I eliminated the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek's troops."

Troops of the North China Military Region held meetings one after another and wrote letters to Chairman Mao, expressing their determination to defend the motherland and oppose the American aggressors. The combat heroes, meritorious soldiers, model workers, and Communist Party members of various units are even more deeply resentful of the US imperialists' crimes of expanding aggression. In their letters to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, they solemnly wrote: "We guarantee that in the struggle to defend the motherland and defend world peace, we will closely unite the masses and make greater contributions to the people."

Wu Jingting, a famous militia hero of North China, reported on the spirit of the National Conference of Combat Heroes to the militiamen in various parts of the Anyang Military Subdistrict and said: "After I return to the village, I will train the militia well and prepare a reserve force for the National Defense Forces. If US imperialism invades us, our militia, in coordination with the main forces, will surely defeat them utterly."

The representatives of heroes from various units who participated in the National Conference of Combat Heroes in the capital and returned to their units have earnestly conveyed the spirit of the conference. They called on their comrades to raise their vigilance and be ready to meet the American aggressors at any time.

Many commanders and fighters wrote letters to the Korean people, expressing their respect and condolences for their heroic struggle for national independence.

[Reported by this newspaper] A certain tank regiment's company of the North China Military Region recently held a forum on anti-US aggression. The commanders and fighters were all extremely indignant and eager to fight, preparing to strike the US imperialists hard. Dong Laifu, the deputy company commander of the company who attended the National Conference of Combat Heroes, said: "We have an iron-like fighting will and the determination to defend the motherland and the people, and to sacrifice everything we have. The US imperialists have already invaded our doorstep! Our Chinese people are not to be trifled with. If they come again, we will surely smash them to pieces!" Zhang Zhiqin, who had just returned from demobilization, said: "When I first returned to the unit, I originally planned to go home to visit. But now the US imperialists have set fire to the door of our country! I resolutely gave up the idea of going home to visit and prepared to strike the US imperialists hard at any time!" Gao Hongji, the deputy platoon leader of the first platoon, is from Kuandian, Northeast China. He said: "I suffered too much from Japanese imperialism in the past. Now the US imperialists want to enslave us again, so we will resolutely fight them!"

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 1st: The new news of American imperialist planes invading our Northeast and the Shandong coastal area has aroused great anger among the 27 representatives of combat heroes and labor models of the Northwest Military Region and the First Field Army. Zhang Baoying, a special-class combat hero of a certain army, said: "If the US imperialists dare to continue to extend the flames of aggressive war to China, we will have the same confidence and strength to eliminate them as we did in eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek troops armed with American weapons." Rade Luofu, a combat hero of a certain army, said: "Today's China is a country where people of all ethnic groups are united and have great strength. All of our commanders and fighters are always ready to cooperate with the fraternal troops of the whole country to eliminate any enemy who dares to invade us." Wang Fu, a young combat hero, said: "We will raise our vigilance, resolutely eliminate bandits and special agents, mobilize the entire army to study and produce hard, so as to enhance our economic and defense strength, defend the motherland, and defend world peace."
