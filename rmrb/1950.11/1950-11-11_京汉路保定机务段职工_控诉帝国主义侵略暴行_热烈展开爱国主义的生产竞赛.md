Turn Hatred into Strength!

　　Baoding Railway Workers' Committee North-South report: After current affairs discussions, the workers of the Baoding Locomotive Depot on the Beijing-Hankou Railway denounced the aggressive crimes of imperialism, turning hatred and anger into strength, and launched a fervent patriotic production campaign. In the past few days, the workers have been enthusiastically discussing the war situation in Korea and closely watching the aggressive actions of American imperialism. Everyone deeply realizes that American imperialism is following the old path of Japanese devils' invasion of China. The workers unanimously agreed in the current affairs discussion: American imperialism wants to drive the Chinese people back to the miserable situation under the occupation of the Japanese devils. They said: "We have had enough of the life of subjugated slaves! The enemy attacks when they want, and kills when they want." Hai Xian, an electrical engineer, worked in Changxindian at that time. He recalled the "foreign dog team" and the "mass grave" of the Japanese secret service team behind the Changxindian Airport. He said, "Do you know how many Chinese people were bitten to death by foreign dogs and piled in the 'mass grave'?!" He was held in the Japanese police section for seven days and almost beaten to death. He said, "When you worked at that time, you were scolded no matter how well or badly you did! If you didn't stand in line properly, you would be slapped a few times." Shi Wenping, a water supply worker, was taken to Japan to do hard labor for two years and suffered inhuman abuse. He saw his companions being buried alive, pushed into the sea, or dying hopelessly from illness." Shi Guanghua lived in Beiguan Village, Baoding. In 1937, after the Japanese occupied Baoding, he personally saw the Japanese devils stab to death more than two hundred adults and children in the village. Many people said, "Can we let such days come back again?!" Luo Wang, a fitter, said, "If we fight with the American imperialists, I can live on chaff!" Someone said, "Give money if needed, give strength if needed, and tighten our belts to support the front line!" Yang Shunqi, an old worker of the "February 7th" strike, said, "From now on, we must work harder in the rear so that the front has whatever it needs!" Gu Shanshui, a coal platform worker, proposed: "Let's do the work of three people with two people, and let the extra person join the volunteer army! If we can't fight, we can carry bullets!" All the crew members of locomotive ㄒㄇㄎ, No. 1929, raised their arms and swore: "We will take our train wherever it is needed, and we will join the volunteer army when needed!" Anger and hatred immediately transformed into a huge force. Each unit and each locomotive successively proposed guarantees to complete the collective contract tasks for November and December ahead of schedule and launched a challenge competition. After discussion, the ironworker team planned to complete the tasks stipulated in the collective contract ten days in advance and divided the fifty days into five periods to complete, formulating plans for each period. Other units such as the fitter team, overhaul group, water supply station, and each locomotive crew also formulated specific plans and guarantees. Every worker felt that he was shouldering important tasks that were different from usual. This feeling prompted them to work with unparalleled enthusiasm. They realized that completing the task was adding a point of strength to Resist America and Aid Korea.

    控诉帝国主义侵略暴行
    热烈展开爱国主义的生产竞赛
    【本报讯】保定铁路工委会南北报道：京汉路保定机务段职工经过时事座谈，控诉了帝国主义的侵略暴行，把仇恨和愤怒变成力量，掀起了热烈的爱国主义的生产竞赛。几天来职工们都在热烈地讨论着朝鲜的战争形势，密切地注视着美国帝国主义的侵略行动。大家深刻认识到美帝正走着日本鬼子侵略中国的老路。职工们在时事座谈中一致认为：美国帝国主义是要想把中国人民再驱到过去日本鬼子侵占下的悲惨境界中。他们说：“亡国奴的生活，我们实在过够了！敌人说打便打，要杀就杀。”电机工程海贤那时在长辛店做工，他想起长辛店机场后面日本特务队的“洋狗队”和“万人坑”，他说：“你想多少中国人被洋狗咬死，堆在‘万人坑’里？！”他曾在日本警务段被压了七天，差点没有打死。他说：“那时干活，做好做歹都是臭骂一顿！站队站不好，上去就是几个耳光。”给水工史文平被押到日本国内做了两年苦工，受尽了非人的虐待。他看到自己的同伴被活埋，被推到海里，或因病无望的死去。”史光华住在保定北关村，一九三七年日本人侵占保定后，他亲眼看到日本鬼子在村里扎死了二百多大人和孩子。许多人说：“这样的日子还能让它再回来吗？！”钳工罗旺说：“要是和美帝干起来，我吃糠也能行！”有人说：“要出钱出钱，要出力出力，节衣缩食支援前线！”“二七”老工人杨顺起说：“我们从现在起，在后方要多干活，使前方用什么就有什么！”煤台工谷山水提出：“咱们三个人的活两人干，富余的一个人参加志愿军去！打不了仗，扛子弹也行！”ㄒㄇㄎ、１９２９号机车全体乘务员举起胳膊宣誓说：“叫我们的车到那里就到那里，需要我们时，我们就参加志愿军去！”愤怒和仇恨即时化为一股巨大的力量，各单位和各机车纷纷提出保证，要提前完成十一、十二两月集体合同的任务，展开了挑战竞赛，经过讨论，铁工班计划把集体合同规定的任务提早十天完成，并把五十天分为五期完成，分期订出了计划。其他如钳工班、包修组、给水所、各机车包乘组都订出了具体计划和保证条件。每个职工都感觉到他已担负着和往常不同的重要的任务。这感觉促使他们以无比的热情而劳动。他们意识到，完成任务就是给抗美援朝增加一分力量。
