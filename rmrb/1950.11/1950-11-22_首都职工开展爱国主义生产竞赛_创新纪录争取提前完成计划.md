　　Capital Workers Launch Patriotic Production Competition
　　Innovate Records, Strive to Complete Plans Ahead of Schedule
　　[This newspaper's news] Capital workers are transforming their hatred and anger towards American imperialism into strength, launching a patriotic production competition to increase production, practice thrift, resist America and aid Korea, and defend their homes and country.
　　Workers at the Central People's Printing Factory and the Beijing Clothing Factory have both put forward the slogan of striving to complete production plans ahead of schedule. Workers at the Beijing Clothing Factory shouted, "The factory is the battlefield, and machines are weapons." The production records of the vast majority of workers have exceeded standards. On the 3rd of this month, workers in the eighth shift of the first sewing department each completed fifteen sets of military uniforms, exceeding the standard by one-fold. Jiao Dama, an old sewing worker in the second sewing department, is already sixty-one years old and could have retired, but in order to rush to complete the production plan, she works overtime every day without complaining of fatigue. She said, "In order to strengthen national defense forces, prepare to drive away the American imperialists who are invading China, and live a good life, I am not afraid of being tired, no matter how tired I am."
　　After studying current events and discussions, the workers of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau have further recognized the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism, and a wave of patriotic production competitions has been set off throughout the bureau. The workers firmly stated that they would ensure smooth telecommunications, obey organizational assignments, complete production and emergency tasks, strictly guard state secrets, and do a good job in anti-espionage, anti-air raid, fire prevention, and anti-theft work. More than 160 engineering and technical personnel of the bureau jointly issued a "Declaration of Resistance Against America and Aid to Korea," expressing their support for the joint declaration of the Chinese democratic parties. Lou Yanli, an engineer of the bureau who had studied in the United States, said: "When we studied in the United States, American imperialism vainly attempted to train us to become so-called 'liberal' American-style intellectuals, to serve the Kuomintang reactionaries, and to act as pawns for American imperialism's aggression against China. However, after more than a year of education from the People's Government, our political understanding has improved, and we must not tolerate American imperialism's expansion of its war of aggression. We are determined to stick to our posts and contribute all our strength to ensure that our work is done well."
　　Workers at the state-owned Liulihe Cement Plant are supporting Korea and opposing American imperialist aggression with practical actions. All employees overcame all difficulties and victoriously completed the annual production task for 1950 on October 25th (3 a.m.) ahead of schedule. In order to further enhance the country's strength, the employees of the factory are striving to create higher new production records with redoubled active production actions.
　　All the workers of the private Dahua Pottery Company, in order to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend the country, responded to the call of the trade union and launched a patriotic production competition. They signed a production contract with the capitalists for November and December. The workers have the confidence and determination to exceed the plan. Many workers have also put forward personal plans: to ensure that they are not late or leave early, and to increase the quantity and quality of production by 20 to 30 percent. As soon as the labor competition began, many activists emerged. Roughcast workers Mao Guoyi, Zhou Shengde, and Mi Rong increased their output by 8 to 15 percent.
　　After seeing the "Joint Declaration of Democratic Parties," the workers of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory used their practical actions to respond to this solemn declaration. The Zhang Fengquan team of the machinery factory proposed: All comrades in the team should completely eliminate defective products in their production posts, improve the quantity and quality of production, and increase the wealth of the motherland to support the just war in Korea. The Xian Jinghua team decided that all existing production tasks of the team would be completed two to three days ahead of schedule. New records have continuously appeared in some departments. For example, Wang Shubin made pinion gears for hobbing shafts and increased production from 35 to 60 per day within four days. Zhang Lianjing, Li Chunxu, Hou Quan, and others made chaff cutter frames, and all increased production from ten to twelve per day. Most of the engineers in the factory had been to the United States and Britain, and they had personally experienced the oppression and discrimination of American imperialism. Therefore, during the discussion, the engineers expressed great indignation at the atrocities of the American imperialists today. (Yang Qing, Qing Shangyuan, Ren Zuo, Lu Niangao)

　　首都职工开展爱国主义生产竞赛
    创新纪录争取提前完成计划
    【本报讯】首都职工把对美国帝国主义的仇恨和愤怒化为力量，开展爱国主义生产竞赛，以提高生产，进行节约，实行抗美援朝，保家卫国。
    中央人民印刷厂和北京被服厂的职工都提出争取提早完成生产计划的口号。北京被服厂全厂职工喊出：“工厂就是战场，机器就是武器。”绝大部分职工的生产纪录都超过了标准。第一缝纫部第八班工人在本月三日一天中每人完成了十五套军服，超出标准一倍。第二缝纫部的老缝纫工焦大妈已六十一岁，本来可以退休了，但是她为了突击完成生产计划，每日加班从不说累。她说：“为了加强国防力量，准备打跑侵略我们中国的美帝国主义，过好日子，再累也不怕。”
    北京电信局职工经过时事学习讨论后，更认清了美帝国主义的侵略野心，全局掀起了爱国主义生产竞赛热潮。职工们坚决表示要保证电讯畅通，服从组织调配，完成生产和紧急任务，严守国家机密，并作好防特、防空、防火、防盗等工作。该局工程技术工作人员一百六十余人联名发表“抗美援朝宣言”，表示拥护中国各民主党派联合宣言。该局曾在美国留学的工程师楼彦厘说：“我们留学美国的时候，美国帝国主义妄想把我们训练成为所谓‘自由主义’的美国式的知识分子，为国民党反动派服务，充当美帝国主义侵略中国的爪牙。可是我们经过了人民政府这一年多的教育，我们的政治认识提高了，我们决不能容忍美帝国主义扩大侵略战争，我们决心坚守岗位，贡献出一切力量保证把工作做好。”
    国营琉璃河水泥厂职工们，以实际行动，支援朝鲜，反对美帝侵略。全体员工克服了一切困难，将一九五○年全年生产任务于十月二十五日（早三时）提前胜利完成。该厂员工们，为进一步增强国家的实力，正以加倍的积极生产行动，为争取创更高的生产新纪录而奋斗中。
    私营大华窑业公司全体工人为抗美援朝保家卫国，响应工会号召，掀起了爱国主义的生产竞赛。和资方订立了十一、十二两个月的生产合同。工友们有信心和决心超过计划。很多工友并提出了个人计划：保证不迟到，不早退，提高产量质量百分之二十到三十。劳动竞赛一开始就涌现了许多积极分子。粗坯工人毛国义、周盛德、米荣提高产量百分之八至百分之十五。
    华北农业机械厂职工们看到了“各民主党派联合宣言”后，各个车间的工友们用自己的实际行动响应了这个庄严的宣言。机工厂张凤泉小组提出：全组同志在自己的生产岗位上彻底消灭废品，提高产量质量，增加祖国财富以支援朝鲜正义战争。咸景华小组决定全组现有的各种生产任务都提前两天至三天完成。有的部门连续出现新纪录，如王书彬做滚刀轴小齿轮，在四天之内，从每天三十五个增加到六十个。张连景、李春旭、侯全等做铡草机机架，都从每天十个提高到十二个。该厂的工程师大部分到过美国和英国，他们都亲身尝过美帝国主义的压迫和歧视，所以在讨论中工程师们对美帝今天的暴行，表示出极大的愤恨。（杨青、卿尚源、任佐、卢念高）
