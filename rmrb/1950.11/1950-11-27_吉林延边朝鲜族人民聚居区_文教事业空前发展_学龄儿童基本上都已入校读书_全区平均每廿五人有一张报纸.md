Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, November 21st: Under the leadership of the People's Government, the culture, education, and publishing industries in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture of Jilin Province, Northeast China, have achieved unprecedented development. In the five counties of Yanji, Wangqing, Helong, Huichun, and Anguo in the region, 357 schools have been established, including one university, twenty-five middle schools, and three hundred and thirty-one elementary schools. On average, there is one elementary school in every rural area and five middle schools in each county. The total number of students has reached 111,040, exceeding the number during the puppet Manchukuo regime by a quarter. School-age children in the region are basically enrolled in schools. Among the children and youth in school, 90% are the children of liberated poor peasants, hired farmworkers, and middle peasants.

The Korean-language news and publishing industries in the region have greatly developed since liberation. The "Northeast Korean People's Daily" and the "Worker-Peasant Daily," distributed within the region, have each published more than 560 issues. The two newspapers have a combined daily circulation of more than 45,000 copies, averaging one newspaper for every twenty-five Korean people in the region. Various educational materials have also been published in large quantities. In the past three years, a total of more than 310 types of school textbooks, educational reference materials, worker-peasant reading materials, and magazines, totaling more than 440,000 copies, have been published. The content of all kinds of books and newspapers embodies the spirit of patriotism and the people's democratic dictatorship, and is welcomed by the majority of readers.

The Korean people of the region, like other ethnic groups in China, have always loved their motherland and national culture. However, since the Japanese invasion of Northeast China in 1931, the freedom of cultural and educational undertakings, like other construction endeavors, has been completely deprived. Even speaking Korean was prohibited, and they suffered all kinds of oppression and pain. After the "August 15th" liberation, the Korean people of the region, like other ethnic groups in China, were able to stand up under the leadership of the People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, and cultural and educational undertakings have also developed rapidly. Soon after liberation, the Yanbian Special District Office and the People's Governments of various counties first established leadership organizations for cultural and educational undertakings at all levels and restored Korean-language textbooks. Subsequently, in 1947, planned teacher training and school consolidation were carried out, resulting in a large increase in the number of students enrolled. Poor children who had been exploited by the Japanese invaders to work as laborers in the past also gained the opportunity to study. In rural areas, winter schools were widely established. Last winter, more than 83,000 peasants regularly participated in learning. This spring, the winter schools were transformed into regular agricultural schools to meet the peasants' demands for cultural learning. In the past, illiteracy accounted for the vast majority of the population in the region, but it has now been reduced to about 25% of the total population.

　　吉林延边朝鲜族人民聚居区
    文教事业空前发展
    学龄儿童基本上都已入校读书
    全区平均每廿五人有一张报纸
    【新华社吉林二十一日电】东北吉林省延边朝鲜民族人民聚居的地区的文化、教育、出版事业，在人民政府的领导之下，获得了空前发展。该区延吉、汪清、和龙、挥春、安国五县中，已建立起三百五十七所学校，其中大学一所，中学二十五所，小学三百三十一所；平均每一个农村有一所小学，每个县五所中学。学生共达十一万一千零四十余人，超过伪满时人数四分之一。全区学龄儿童基本上都已入校读书。在学的儿童和青年中，有百分之九十是翻身的贫、雇农和中农成份的农民子弟。
    该区内用朝鲜文字的新闻、出版事业，解放后已大大发达。发行于区内的《东北朝鲜人民日报》和《工农报》，各已发刊五百六十多期，两报每日共发行四万五千余份，在全区平均每二十五个朝鲜民族人民可有一张报纸。各种教育读物也大批出版，在近三年中，出版的学校教科书、教育参考资料、工农读物和杂志等，共达三百一十余种，四十四万余部。各种书报的内容，都贯彻了爱国主义和人民民主专政的精神，受到广大读者的欢迎。
    该区的朝鲜族人民和中国其他各民族人民一样，历来都热爱自己的祖国和民族的文化，但自一九三一年日寇侵占东北后，文化教育事业的自由便和其他各种建设事业同样地被完全剥夺，连说话亦不能用朝鲜语，受尽了各种压迫和痛苦。“八一五”解放以后，该区朝鲜民族人民才和中国其他各民族人民一样在人民政府和中国共产党领导下翻过身来，跟着文化教育事业也得到了迅速发展。解放不久延边专署和各县人民政府，首先建立了各级文化教育事业的领导机构，恢复了朝鲜文字的课本。继于一九四七年进行有计划的师资训练和整顿学校等工作，使就学的学生大增。过去曾被日寇压榨以作苦工为生的贫苦儿童，也得到了读书机会。在农村中，并普遍开办了冬学。去年冬天经常参加学习的农民，达八万三千余人。今年春季又将冬学改为经常性的农校，以满足农民学习文化的要求。过去该区文盲占绝大部分，现已减少到占总人口的百分之二十五左右。
