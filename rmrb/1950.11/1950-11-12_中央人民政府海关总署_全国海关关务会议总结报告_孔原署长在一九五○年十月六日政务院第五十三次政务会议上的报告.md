The National Customs Conference of the General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government began on June 19th. Seventy-one responsible cadres from the General Administration of Customs and local customs across the country, along with thirteen representatives from various central ministries, departments, and commissions related to customs affairs, attended the conference. It lasted for twenty-eight days (actually meeting for twenty-one days) and successfully concluded on July 16th. The conference first studied the Government Administration Council's decision on customs policies and customs work. Then, it reviewed and discussed the draft customs law prepared by the Customs Law Special Committee. Many significant revisions and supplements were made to the draft, achieving ideological consensus on fundamental issues. In addition, the conference discussed the principles for establishing customs and the organizational structure of various customs offices. The main issues discussed at the conference and the solutions adopted are reported below for your consideration and instruction.

	I. Current Situation and Characteristics of National Customs

From 1853 to 1949, for nearly a century, China's customs were always controlled by imperialists. They first relied on the privileges of unequal treaties to force the formulation of low import and export tax rates, dumping foreign goods in large quantities and absorbing raw materials at low prices to strangle China's national industry. Furthermore, they directly seized China's customs administrative management rights and tariff revenue rights, completely westernizing all systems, regulations, and styles, and encompassing many matters unrelated to customs, such as the management of maritime and port affairs, and border and coastal patrols, expanding the infringement of China's rights and facilitating imperialist aggression. The old Chinese customs were thus unindependent and unautonomous, long ruled by British and American imperialism. This painful history of the old customs, which was unindependent and unautonomous, is inseparable from the history of our nation being oppressed and enslaved.

The great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution ended the rule of imperialism in China. The old customs controlled by imperialism have perished along with the rule of the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China. As Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his instructions on customs policy at the cadre meeting celebrating the "May 1st" Labor Day this year: "Imperialism has been driven out of China, and many privileges of imperialism in China have been abolished. The customs policy and foreign trade policy of New China have become important tools for protecting the development of New China's industry. That is to say, we have put the key to China's gate in our own pockets, not in the pockets of imperialists and their running dogs as in the past. From now on, Chinese industry will not be subject to competition from cheap goods of imperialism, and China's raw materials will first be supplied to its own industrial needs. This has removed the biggest obstacle that has prevented the development of Chinese industry for a hundred years."

There are currently twenty-seven independent customs offices, nineteen sub-customs offices, and one hundred and twenty-seven branch customs offices (posts and stations) nationwide. Among the twenty-seven independent customs offices, they can be divided into two main categories. One category is the customs of the old liberated areas, with a total of nine: Manzhouli, Suifenhe, Tumen, Ji'an, Andong, Luda, Yingkou, Wafangdian, and Yantai. Its characteristic is that it has no connection with the old customs of the Kuomintang era. It was established successively with the development of the revolutionary situation, and its organizational system is relatively simple. The cadres and personnel are all from the old liberated areas and lack formal customs work experience. The other category was liberated last year and this year, totaling eighteen: Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, Kowloon, Gongbei, Jiangmen, Beihai, Zhanjiang, Qiongzhou, Dihua, Hankou, Kunming, Tengchong, and Longzhou. Most of them have a complete set of westernized systems.

After the establishment of the Central People's Government, foreign trade nationwide has developed rapidly, and customs work has exceeded the scope of local areas. In the past eight months, the new and old cadres of customs in various places have worked together and have done a lot of work and achieved many achievements. However, in terms of organizational forms, business systems, and work styles, they still have ununified and irregular characteristics, and many influences from the old customs. The old organizational structure and business system are basically no longer applicable, and a new set has not been established completely and in a timely manner. The organizational form, management system, business system, and tariff rates of customs are still not unified in various places. Certain phenomena of each doing its own way, independent administration, and confusion and disconnection are quite serious, and both new and old cadres feel at a loss. This situation requires us to reform the customs organization in a step-by-step manner, unify policies and business, unify systems and regulations, unify management and leadership, and formulate new customs laws as the basis for realizing this unification.

	II. Several Central Issues of the Draft Customs Law

The basic basis for formulating the new draft customs law is: the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (especially Article 26 on the fundamental principles of economic construction, Article 37 on implementing foreign trade control and trade protection policies, Article 39 on the management of foreign exchange, foreign currency and gold and silver, Article 40 on tax policies and simplified tax systems, and Article 57 on restoring and developing foreign trade relations) and the decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on customs policies and customs work on January 27th of this year. The following reports on several important issues in the draft, for the reference of the Government Administration Council in reviewing the draft.

	(1) Unification and Centralization Issues:

How to realize the policy of unified management and unified leadership is an extremely important issue for current customs work. The Government Administration Council decided that "the General Administration of Customs must be a unified, centralized, independent, and autonomous state organ." The draft customs law plans to stipulate that all customs institutions and their businesses shall be managed by the General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government. Some different understandings have arisen about this principle. The core of the problem lies in whether the General Administration of Customs directly leads the national customs in a unified and centralized manner, or whether a regional management system is established according to administrative divisions? Some people advocate regional management, which is due to a lack of understanding that unified and direct leadership of the national customs by the General Administration is necessary for the organizational performance and work characteristics of the customs. The national foreign nature of customs work determines that it must be done in order to complete its duties and tasks. Experience from all parties has also proved that it is entirely possible for the General Administration to directly lead only twenty-odd independent customs across the country. The establishment of customs is limited to national borders and several transportation hubs in the interior, so there is no need to organize according to the principle of administrative divisions, and therefore no need for a second-level intermediate management agency. However, the people's governments of the Greater Administrative Regions still have the responsibility to implement guidance and supervision over the customs in their jurisdictions. In addition, in certain circumstances, adopting forms such as resident special commissioners of the General Administration and representative agencies of the General Administration (such as the South China Customs Office) is also necessary.

	(2) Scope of Authority:

The authority of the old customs was all-encompassing and boundless. Its working relationship with various relevant departments was one of being the only one that mattered, leading to many contradictions. This abnormal and unreasonable situation must be fundamentally changed. The basic principle for handling this issue should be how to clarify responsibilities and divide labor and coordinate. According to the decision of the Government Administration Council, (1) to be responsible for the actual supervision of all kinds of goods and currencies entering and leaving the country, (2) to collect customs duties, and (3) to fight against smuggling are the three major tasks of the new Chinese customs. In order to implement this decision, we must both correct the residual influence of the old all-encompassing "Great Customsism" and prevent the attitude of irresponsibility and abandoning one's due responsibilities. Duties such as maritime affairs and port affairs that are not related to customs must be removed, but the powers related to customs' implementation of supervision, inspection, taxation, and anti-smuggling operations should not be abandoned; general border patrol work must be removed, but the anti-smuggling powers within the scope of customs should not be fundamentally canceled. According to the above principles, various specific issues will be resolved. Regarding the division of labor and cooperation between customs and transportation departments, the draft customs law plans to stipulate that, on the one hand, the Ministry of Communications shall jointly with the General Administration of Customs establish the tonnage limits and other conditions that international navigation vessels should have; on the other hand, the customs shall jointly with the local port authorities stipulate and announce the berthing and loading and unloading areas for international navigation vessels in ports. Specific regulations have also been made on the division of labor and cooperation between customs and public security departments, anti-smuggling powers, and the handling of smuggled goods: All smuggling prohibition work (including inspection of passengers and their luggage) within the scope of ports, stations, national border channels, international airports, and other places related to customs business where customs offices are located shall be the responsibility of the customs. The coastal and border anti-smuggling powers that do not fall within the above scope shall be exercised by the public security organs in accordance with the provisions of the customs law, but the smuggled goods cases they find shall be transferred to the customs for handling.

	(3) Principles for Establishing Customs Offices:

The locations of the old customs offices were almost all commercial ports forced open under unequal treaties to facilitate economic aggression by imperialist countries. Now that we have completely restored the independent and autonomous right of customs, we should re-stipulate the principles for establishing customs offices according to the needs of China's economic development. The draft customs law stipulates that customs institutions shall be established in the following places: (1) ports that the Central People's Government has decided to open to foreign trade; (2) border and international railway stations; (3) locations on land borders and boundary rivers where goods and passengers are allowed to enter and exit; (4) international airports where passengers and goods are allowed to board and disembark; (5) places for exchanging international postal parcels and mail; (6) places where the Central People's Government has specially approved to handle import and export procedures for goods. The implementation of the above principles will fundamentally change the phenomenon of "internal checkpoints everywhere, external doors wide open" in old China.

	(4) Supervision of Cargo Transportation:

The old customs' supervision of cargo transportation was not focused, did not distinguish between foreign trade and domestic trade, was formalistic, and blindly pursued the expansion of the scope of supervision, regardless of the actual effect. In response to these shortcomings in the past, in accordance with the spirit of the Common Program "implementing foreign trade control" and "free domestic trade," we strive to simplify and re-stipulate a new system for supervising import and export cargo transportation: (1) In terms of imported goods, the old annual bond system has been abolished, and a new responsibility system has been established. Specifically stipulate the responsibilities of the captain and warehouse manager, stipulate that customs declarations must be made within a certain period, and stipulate the handling methods for goods that are not declared and taxed. (2) Establish necessary supervision for export goods, which did not exist in the past. The draft customs law stipulates that export goods must be placed in the specified warehouse after inspection and must not be exported without customs approval. (3) Abolish the old bonded system and stipulate new bonded methods according to actual needs. (4) Establish consistent supervision procedures and cancel the complex and ununified supervision procedures in the past (such as in the railway sector, the supervision methods for cargo transportation used to be different for each railway). (5) Establish a necessary supervision system for transit and transshipment goods. (6) Stipulate new supervision methods for passenger luggage. It should be especially mentioned that for domestic cargo transportation, except for some coastal areas where smuggling is particularly serious, all controls will be canceled to facilitate the exchange of materials in various places.

	(5) Declaration, Inspection and Taxation:

The conference negated the old customs system of separating the inspection and valuation section from the taxation section, which was disjointed and cumbersome and slow in procedures. The draft customs law stipulates methods for eliminating delays in declaration, inspection, payment, and pickup, requiring quick declaration, quick inspection, quick taxation, and quick pickup to accelerate the circulation of domestic and foreign cargo and increase the income of the national economy. The old bonded warehouse system allowed foreign goods to be imported and taxed or re-exported duty-free within one year of entering China, which was conducive to capitalist countries and their merchants hoarding goods and manipulating market prices in our country. It must be fundamentally reformed, and separate bonded methods for certain imported items, such as bulk mineral oil, and tax refund methods for specific imported raw materials dedicated to export goods must be formulated. The conference studied the Government Administration Council's decision to formulate two import tax rates and the principle instructed by the Government Administration Council that "for industrial products and semi-finished products that can be produced in large quantities domestically or cannot be produced in large quantities temporarily but have development prospects in the future... the customs tax rate should be higher than the difference between the cost of the item and the cost of the same product in our country," and clarified the regulations on import tax rates.

	(6) Anti-Smuggling:

The conference criticized the old customs for monopolizing all anti-smuggling powers along the coast and borders, actually condoning large-scale organized armed smuggling, and the old customs' anti-smuggling regulations for treating smuggling and violations equally, regardless of their severity. The draft customs law establishes the principle of division of labor and cooperation between customs anti-smuggling work and border defense departments; distinguishes between smuggling cases and violation cases, major smuggling acts and ordinary smuggling acts; stipulates that smuggled goods shall be confiscated and confiscated, and for major smuggling criminals, heavier penalties may be imposed and sent to the People's Court for sentencing according to law. "Strict investigation and lenient treatment" can no longer be used as a general policy, and a policy of distinguishing between severity, combining education and punishment should be adopted according to the specific circumstances. Special regulations suitable for local conditions must be formulated for the Hong Kong and Macao border areas where smuggling is particularly serious. In addition, it is stipulated that the heads of each customs office have the right to change their own decisions on smuggling cases. It is stipulated that the decision of the General Administration of Customs on smuggling appeal cases is the final decision.

	III. Customs Establishment Plan and Organizational Structure

	(1) Customs Establishment Plan:

The conference discussed and approved the "General Rules for Customs Establishment and the Plan for Adjusting National Customs Institutions" proposed by the General Administration. It was unanimously agreed that the principle for establishing customs in the new China should be to establish customs institutions in places open to foreign trade, based on China's economic situation and the needs of foreign trade, in the spirit of independence and autonomy. Therefore, all customs institutions such as customs offices, sentry posts, and stations established in places not open to foreign trade in the past, whether they are still continuing to handle inspection and taxation, or are only for preventing smuggling, or supervising domestic trade, should be abolished. Those located in coastal and border areas with anti-smuggling tasks should be gradually handed over to public security organs in a planned manner according to the specific circumstances. According to the provisions of the "General Rules for Customs Establishment and the Plan for Adjusting National Customs Institutions," the existing customs and their branches nationwide will be reduced from 173 to 70. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government in 1943, the number of customs offices in the Great Rear Area alone, excluding the occupied areas, reached as many as 454. We now plan to establish independent customs offices in 26 places: Manzhouli, Suifenhe, Tumen, Ji'an, Andong, Dalian, Yingkou, Shenyang, Tianjin, Beijing, Qingdao, Shanghai, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Hankou, Shantou, Guangzhou, Kowloon (located in Shenzhen), Jiangmen, Wuzhou, Zhanjiang, Haikou, Beihai, Kunming, Tengchong, and Dihua. This is a major change in the customs organization.

	(2) Organizational Structure:

The conference agreed in principle to the "General Rules for the Organization of Local Customs Offices and the Provisional Plan for the Structure of Various Customs Offices" proposed by the General Administration. According to this plan, many unreasonable phenomena in the internal organization and division of labor of the old customs have been eliminated. It was decided to combine inspection, valuation, and taxation work into one, unify the handling of anti-smuggling and smuggled goods, and elevate cargo transportation supervision to an important position. In this way, the customs is guaranteed to implement the government's decrees and decisions on foreign trade control from the organizational form. This organizational plan can be implemented on a trial basis by various customs offices. Regarding staffing, the conference determined three principles: (1) based on the actual needs of current work, and taking into account the needs when Taiwan is liberated, the coastal blockade is completely lifted, and customs business is fully restored in the future; (2) strive to streamline personnel and institutions; (3) gradually unify the organization and structure of customs nationwide. Now, the organization and structure of customs are being adjusted according to these principles.

Our future task is to continue to conduct in-depth research according to the provisions of the draft customs law, formulate the necessary implementation details, regulations, and rules, especially to strengthen the publicity and education of the customs law in various customs offices and among the people of the whole country, improve the political and professional level of all staff, establish a clean and simple revolutionary work style of serving the people, overcome shortcomings and errors in work, and implement the basic spirit of the customs law into every specific practical work of customs nationwide.

　　中央人民政府海关总署
    全国海关关务会议总结报告——孔原署长在一九五○年十月六日政务院第五十三次政务会议上的报告
    全国海关关务会议于六月十九日开始，出席的有海关总署和全国各地海关负责干部七十一人，及与海关业务有关的中央各院、部、会代表十三人，历时二十八天（实际开会二十一天），已于七月十六日圆满闭幕。会议首先学习了政务院关于关税政策和海关工作的决定，然后进行海关法规专门委员会所草拟的海关法草案的报告和讨论。对草案作了许多重大的修改和补充，在基本问题上获得思想上的一致，此外并讨论了设关原则和各关组织编制等问题。兹将会议的主要问题及其解决方针办法报告如下，当否请指示：
            一、全国海关的现状和特点
    从一八五三年到一九四九年，将近百年，我国海关始终掌握在帝国主义者手里。他们先凭借不平等条约的特权强迫制定进出口低税率，大量倾销外货，廉价吸取原料，以绞杀我国民族工业，并进一步直接掌握了我国海关行政管理权，关税收支权，使一切制度规章作风完全洋化，并包揽了许多与海关不相干的事情，如海务港务的管理，国境海岸的巡卫等，扩大侵害我国权益，便利帝国主义的侵略。旧中国海关就是这样不独立不自主长期被英美帝国主义所统治着的。旧海关这种不独立不自主的惨痛历史是与我们民族被压迫被奴役的历史分不开的。
    中国人民革命的伟大胜利，结束了帝国主义在中国的统治。受帝国主义控制的旧海关已随着半封建半殖民地旧中国的统治一起灭亡。正如刘少奇副主席在本年庆祝“五、一”劳动节干部大会上关于海关政策的指示：“帝国主义已经从中国赶走，帝国主义在中国的许多特权已经被取消，新中国的海关政策与对外贸易政策已经成为保护新中国工业发展的重要工具，这就是说，我们已把中国大门的钥匙放在自己的袋子里，而不是如过去一样放在帝国主义及其走狗的袋子里。从今以后，中国工业就不致受到帝国主义的廉价商品的竞争，中国的原料将首先供给自己工业的需要。这就扫除了一百年来使中国工业不能发展的一个最大的障碍。”
    全国现有二十七处独立关，十九处分关，一二七处支关（所、站）。在二十七处独立关中，可以分为两大类。一类是老解放区的海关，共有九个：满洲里、绥芬河、图们、辑安、安东、旅大、营口、瓦房店及烟台。它的特点是与国民党时代的旧海关没有联系，是随着革命形势的发展先后建立起来，组织制度比较简陋，干部人员都是老解放区的，缺乏正规的海关工作经验。另一类是在去年和今年解放的，共十八个：天津、青岛、上海、福州、厦门、汕头、广州、九龙、拱北、江门、北海、湛江、琼州、迪化、汉口、昆明、腾冲、龙州，大都有一套形式完整的洋化制度。
    中央人民政府成立后，全国对外贸易日益发展，海关工作已超出局部地方性的范围。八个月来，各地海关新老干部共同努力，做了许多工作，获得许多成绩，但在组织形式业务制度和工作作风上，还带有不统一不正规的特点，和许多旧海关的影响。旧的组织机构和业务制度，基本上已不适用，而新的一套尚未能及时地完全建立起来。海关的组织形式、管理系统、业务制度、税则税率等，各地仍未统一，某些各行其是，各自为政和混乱脱节的现象相当严重，新老干部均感无所适从。这种情况，要求我们有步骤地进行海关组织的改革，统一政策业务，统一制度规章，统一管理领导，并制定新的海关法规，作为实现这种统一的基础。
            二、海关法草案的几个中心问题
    我们制定新海关法草案的基本根据是：人民政协共同纲领（特别是第二十六条关于经济建设的根本方针，第三十七条关于实行对外贸易管制与保护贸易的政策，第三十九条关于外汇外币与金银的管理，第四十条关于税收政策和简化税制，以及第五十七条关于恢复与发展对外通商贸易关系的规定）和本年一月二十七日中央人民政府政务院关于关税政策和海关工作的决定。兹将草案中的几个重要问题报告于后，供政务院审查该项草案的参考。
        （一）统一集中问题：
    如何实现统一管理统一领导的方针，对于目前海关工作是极其重要的问题。政务院决定“海关总署必须是统一集中的和独立自主的国家机关”，海关法草案拟规定一切海关机构及其业务统由中央人民政府海关总署管理之。对这个原则曾发生一些不同的了解。问题的中心是在于由海关总署统一集中的直接领导全国海关，还是按行政区划建立分区管理制度？有人主张分区管理，这是由于不了解由总署统一直接的领导全国海关，是海关组织性能和工作特点所必需的。海关工作的全国对外性，决定它必须这样才有可能完成其职责任务。各方经验也证明由总署直接领导全国仅仅二十几个独立海关，是完全可能的。海关的设立，仅限于国境及内地若干交通枢纽，故不需要按行政区划的原则来组织，因而也就不需要第二层中间管理机关。但大行政区人民政府对辖区内的海关，仍有实行指导监督的责任。此外，在一定情况下采用总署常驻特派员，总署代表机关（如华南海关处）等形式，也是必须的。
        （二）职权范围问题：
    旧海关的职权是包揽一切，漫无边际，它与各有关部门的工作关系是惟我独尊，矛盾百出。这种不正常不合理的情况，必须根本改变。处理这一问题的基本原则应是如何明确职责和分工配合，根据政务院的决定，（１）负责对出入国境的各种货物货币等执行实际的监督，（２）征收关税，（３）与走私进行斗争，是新中国海关的三大任务。为贯彻这一决定，我们既要纠正旧的包揽一切的“大海关主义”的残余影响，又要防止不负责任放弃自己应有职责的态度。与海关无关的海务港务等职务必须解除，但与海关执行监管验征查私业务有关的职权不应放弃；一般国境巡卫工作必须解除，但不是根本取消海关范围内的查私职权。根据以上原则，来解决各项具体问题。关于海关与运输交通部门分工配合的工作关系问题，海关法草案拟规定一方面由交通部会同海关总署订立国际航行船舶应有的吨位限制和其他条件；另一方面由海关会同当地港务机关规定公布国际航行船舶在港口内的停泊及装卸货物区域。关于海关和公安部门分工配合的工作关系、查私职权、私货处理等问题，亦作了具体规定：凡设有海关的港口、车站、国界孔道、国际机场以及其他有关海关业务的场所范围以内，一切查禁走私工作（包括检查旅客及其行李在内）应由海关负责执行。不属于以上范围的沿海沿边查私职权，由公安机关依据海关法的规定行使之，但其所查获的私货案件应移送海关处理。
    （三）设关原则问题：
    旧海关的设立地点，几乎都是根据不平等条约为便利帝国主义国家经济侵略而被迫开放的通商口岸，现在我们既已完全恢复海关独立自主权，自应根据我国经济发展的需要，重新规定设关原则。海关法草案规定在下列地方，应设立海关机构：（１）中央人民政府决定开放对外贸易的港口；（２）边境及国际联运火车站；（３）陆路边境及国界江河上得准货物旅客进出的地点；（４）得准上下客货的国际航空站；（５）国际邮包邮件交换地点；（６）经中央人民政府特许办理货物进出口手续的地方。实行上述原则，就会根本改变旧中国“对内关卡林立，对外门户洞开”的现象。
        （四）货运监管问题：
    旧海关对货运的监管，是没有重点的，不分对外贸易与国内贸易，是形式主义的，一味追求监管范围的扩大，不计实际的效果。我们针对过去这些缺点，依照共同纲领“实行对外贸易管制”，“国内贸易自由”的精神，力求简化，重新规定监管进出口货运的新制度：（１）进口货物方面，废除了旧的常年保结制度，建立了新的责任制度。具体规定船长、仓库经理人的责任，规定在一定时期内一定要报关，规定了对不报关纳税的货物的处理办法。（２）对出口货物建立了必要的监管，这是过去所没有的。海关法草案规定出口货物在报验后一定要放在规定的仓库场所，未经海关核准，不得出口。（３）废除了旧的保税制度，根据实际的需要，规定新的保税办法。（４）建立一致的监管手续，取消过去不统一的繁复的（如铁路方面，过去每条铁路对货运的监管办法都不同）监管手续。（５）建立对过境及转运货物必须的监管制度。（６）规定新的对旅客行李的监管办法。特别要提到的是对国内货运，除某些走私情况特别严重的沿海地区外，一律取消管制，以便利各地物资的交流。
        （五）报验征税问题：
    会议否定了旧海关验估部分与征税部分分立脱节及手续繁琐迟缓的制度，在海关法草案内制定了取缔滞报、滞验、滞纳、滞提的办法，要求快快报关、快快验货、快快纳税、快快提货，以加速内外货运流通，增长国民经济的收入。旧的保税仓库制度允许洋货于输入中国一年内随时纳税进口或免税复运出口，是有利于资本主义国家及其商人在我国内囤货居奇，操纵市场物价，必须根本改革，另订某些进口物品如散装矿物油的保税办法以及专供外销物品的特定进口原料退税办法。会议研究了政务院必须制订两种进口税率的决定及政务院所指示的“在国内能大量生产的或者暂时还不能大量生产但将来有发展前途的工业品及半制品……海关税率应规定高于该项商品的成本与我国同样货品的成本间之差额”的原则后，对进口税率也作了明确的规定。
        （六）查禁走私问题：
    会议批判了旧海关包揽沿海沿边的一切查私职权，实际上放纵了大规模的有组织的武装走私，以及旧海关缉私条例上走私与违章行为轻重不分一律对待的处理方法。在海关法草案内确定了海关查私工作与边境国防部门分工配合的方针；区别走私案件与违章案件，重大走私行为与普通走私行为；规定走私货物一律没收充公，对于重大走私罪犯，并得加重处罚，解送人民法院依法判刑。“严缉宽处”已不能作为一般的方针，应该根据具体情况，采取分别轻重，教育与处罚相结合的方针。对于目前走私特别严重的港澳边境地区，必须另作适合当地情况的特殊规定。此外，并规定各关关长有权改变他自己对走私案件所作的处分决定。规定海关总署对走私申诉案件的决定为最后决定。
            三、设关方案和组织编制
        （一）设关方案问题：
    会议讨论并通过了总署提出的“设关通则和调整全国海关机构方案”，一致认为新中国海关的设关原则，应以独立自主的精神，根据我国经济情况，及对外贸易的需要，在开放对外贸易地方，设立海关机构。因此，凡过去在非开放对外贸易地方设立的关、哨、所等海关机构，不论是否尚在继续办理查验征税，或仅为防禁走私，或监管国内贸易，应一律裁撤。其位在沿边沿海地区，有查私任务者，应根据具体情况，有计划的逐步移交公安机关。根据“设关通则和调整全国海关机构方案”的规定，全国现有的海关及其分支机构，将由一七三处缩减为七十处。查一九四三年国民党反动政府统治时代全国除沦陷区以外仅大后方海关就曾达四五四处之多。我们现拟设立独立关的地方为二十六处：满洲里、绥芬河、图们、辑安、安东、大连、营口、沈阳、天津、北京、青岛、上海、福州、厦门、汉口、汕头、广州、九龙（设于深圳）、江门、梧州、湛江、海口、北海、昆明、腾冲、迪化。这是海关组织的大变革。
        （二）组织编制问题：
    会议在原则上同意了总署所提出的“地方海关组织通则与各关编制暂行方案”。根据这个方案，取消了旧海关内部组织和分工上许多不合理的现象。决定将验货估价和征税工作并为一体，查私和私货处理工作统一办理，并将货运监管工作，提到重要的地位，这样从组织形式上，保证海关贯彻执行政府对外贸易管制的法令和决定。此项组织方案各关即可试行。关于人员编制，会议确定了三项原则：（１）根据目前工作实际需要，并照顾到将来台湾解放、沿海封锁全部解除、海关业务全面恢复时的需要；（２）人员机构，力求精简；（３）逐渐统一全国海关的组织编制。现在即按这几项原则调整海关的机构和编制。
    我们今后的任务是如何根据海关法草案的规定，继续深入研究，拟订必需的实施细则、规章条例，尤要加强海关法在各地海关和全国人民中的宣传教育，提高全体工作人员的政治业务水平，树立廉洁的朴素的为人民服务的革命工作作风，克服工作中的缺点错误，使海关法的基本精神贯彻到全国海关每一项具体的实际工作中去。
