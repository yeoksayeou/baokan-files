Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, November 6th: People in various parts of the Southwest have launched a wave of enthusiasm to support the advance into Tibet. Most counties under the jurisdiction of the Western Sichuan Administrative Region are enthusiastically carrying out work to support the advancing troops. Countless farmers, students, women, and thousands of various vehicles and boats are participating in the transportation of military grain. In the vigorous grain delivery movement, model workers emerged, such as farmer Du Huanzhang, who pushed more than 600 jin of grain at once, student Gong Junming, who transported more than 2,200 jin of grain in one day, and woman Chen Guifang, who sewed fifteen sacks in half an hour. Workers in various industries in Chengdu are actively producing supplies to support the advance. Large quantities of substitute rice flour, leather clothing, cotton quilts, shoes, and socks are continuously sent to the front.

The fraternal ethnic groups in Yunnan Province are enthusiastically building roads and transporting grain for the advancing troops. Many villages inhabited by ethnic minorities have won the glorious title of "Model Support Villages." The people of the Lijiang area, where ethnic minorities account for about 60 percent of the population, mobilized a grain transportation team of about 12,000 people. Many Tibetan compatriots in the Deqin, Weixi, and Zhongdian areas voluntarily requested to take on the task of transporting grain with their mules and horses.

The people in the above-mentioned areas also warmly welcomed and saw off the advancing troops. In the more than 100-kilometer journey within Western Sichuan, the troops received more than 700 banners and a large number of comfort items and letters of appreciation from people from all walks of life in Western Sichuan. In Xinjin County, fifteen gatherings to support the army and send off the troops were held successively. The women of the county organized a comfort group, bringing needles, thread, soap, envelopes, and stationery to wash, sew, and mend clothes and write letters home for the advancing soldiers. The boatmen at a certain ferry crossing voluntarily organized more than 40 wooden boats to assist the advancing troops in crossing the river. They inserted small red flags on the boats, hung portraits of leaders, and shouted loudly, "Comrades! Come aboard my boat." Members of the Chongqing Municipal Democratic Women's Federation and many other women participated in rushing to make cotton clothes. Dockworkers in Chongqing completed the transportation of more than 1,000 pieces of cargo for the advancing troops in two hours. Students in Nanchong, northern Sichuan, immediately took to the streets to carry out propaganda work after hearing the news of the advance.

(Special dispatch from our newspaper in Kangding on the 4th) People from all walks of life in the Kangding area warmly support the advance into Tibet and celebrate the liberation of Qamdo. Tian Bao, member of the Central Nationalities Affairs Commission, believes that the liberation of Qamdo demonstrates the Chinese people's determination to liberate Tibet. The Central People's Government and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the People's Liberation Army have repeatedly expressed their desire for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. The Tibetan people and patriots should immediately return to the big family of the motherland and achieve a peaceful life as soon as possible. Xia Ke Dao Deng, Vice Chairman of the People's Government of Xikang Province, who strongly supports the advance to liberate Tibet, said: The active support of the People's Liberation Army by the Tibetan people in the vast areas on both sides of the Jinsha River has told people how much the Tibetan people love their own army; at the same time, the liberation of Qamdo also shows that the strength of the Chinese people is enough to smash the aggressive conspiracies of American and British imperialism. Kongsa Yiduo, head of Kongsa Township in Ganzi County, Gongga Jiangze, head of Mashu Township, and Jia Ri Nima, Tusi of Zhanhua County, said: After the five-star red flag was planted on the east bank of the Jinsha River, the Tibetan people on the west bank often secretly swam across the river, asking the People's Liberation Army to cross the river quickly; the compatriots on the east bank also voluntarily supplied grain and livestock to strive for the early liberation of their brothers on the other side. Today, although Qamdo has been liberated, the Tibetan people have not yet gotten rid of the shackles of imperialism, and still need our efforts.

Riku Living Buddha of Tagong Temple in Kangding, Dorje Tsering of Dajin Temple in Ganzi, and others pointed out based on their personal experience after the liberation of the Kangding area: The people's government's policies of ethnic equality and freedom of religious belief have won the support and love of the vast Tibetan people; the Lhasa authorities should recognize the truth and not be misled by the rumors and slanders of imperialist elements, and strive for the peaceful liberation of all of Tibet as soon as possible.

Xinhua News Agency, 5th: More than ten Tibetan people residing in Beijing, including Ji Jinmei, Li Chunxian, and Sandan Gyatso, held a forum on the 4th to support the advance into Tibet, celebrate the liberation of Qamdo, and oppose imperialism's obstruction of the liberation of Tibet. The participants were smiling and extremely excited. They spoke enthusiastically, celebrating the upcoming liberation of their Tibetan compatriots. Ji Jinmei enthusiastically expressed his support for the People's Liberation Army's advance into Tibet to liberate Tibetan compatriots from the hands of imperialists. Li Chunxian pointed out that during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, ethnic minorities were oppressed and discriminated against. Now, under the leadership of the Central People's Government, Chairman Mao, and the Communist Party of China, ethnic minorities have obtained true equality. The religious beliefs and customs of ethnic minorities have been respected. In the Tibetan-inhabited areas of Qinghai, Gansu, and Xikang that have been liberated, temples and lamas have been protected. This ironclad fact completely shattered the shameless provocations and rumors of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. The participants unanimously stated that only by following Chairman Mao can Tibetan compatriots be liberated. They called on the people and patriots of Tibet to unite, smash the obstructions of imperialist conspirators, and join the warm big family of the motherland. Finally, all the participants stood up and shouted slogans, supporting the advance into Tibet and celebrating the liberation of Qamdo.

    号召争取全藏和平解放，摆脱帝国主义羁绊。
    【新华社重庆六日电】西南各地人民展开了支援进军西藏的热潮。川西行政区所属大部县份都热烈地进行着支援进军部队的工作。无数农民、学生、妇女和数以千计的各种车辆、船筏都参加了运军粮的工作。在轰轰烈烈的抢运公粮运动中，出现了一次推粮六百多斤的农民杜焕章、一天运粮两千二百多斤的学生龚俊明和半点钟缝十五条麻袋的妇女陈桂芳等模范。成都市各业工人积极地生产着支援进军的供应品。代饭粉、皮衣、棉被、鞋袜等大批地源源送上前方。
    云南境内的各兄弟民族同胞热情地为进军部队修路、运粮。不少的有少数民族居住的村子，获得了“支援模范村”的光荣称号。少数民族同胞约占百分之六十的丽江地区人民，曾动员了共约一万二千余人的运粮队。德钦、维西、中甸地区的很多藏族同胞自动带着骡马请求担任运粮任务。
    上述地区人民并热烈迎送进军部队。在川西境内一百多公里的行程中，部队收到川西各界人民赠送的锦旗达七百多面和大批慰劳品、慰问信。在新津县曾先后举行了十五次劳军和欢送大会。该县妇女们组织了慰问小组，带着针线、肥皂和信封信纸，替进军的战士们洗浆缝补和写家信。某渡口的船工，自动组织了四十多只木船，协助进军部队渡河。他们在船上插着小红旗，挂起领袖像，高声叫喊着：“同志！上我这船来。”重庆市民主妇联的会员和其他很多妇女都参加赶制棉衣。重庆市码头工人在两个钟头内运完供应进军部队的一千多件脚货。川北南充的学生听到进军消息后，立刻出动到街头展开宣传工作。
    【本报康定四日专电】康定地区藏族各界人士热烈拥护进军西藏，欢庆昌都解放。中央民族事务委员会委员天宝认为：昌都的解放说明，中国人民解放西藏的决心。中央人民政府和人民解放军朱德总司令一再表明了和平解放西藏的愿望，西藏人民和爱国人士应即回到祖国的大家庭来，早日获得和平的生活。大力支援解放西藏进军的西康省人民政府副主席夏克刀登说：金沙江东西两岸广大地区藏族人民的积极支援人民解放军，已告诉人们藏族人民是怎样热爱他们自己的队伍；同时，昌都的解放，也表明了中国人民的力量足以粉碎美英帝国主义的侵略阴谋。甘孜县孔萨乡乡长孔萨益多、麻书乡乡长贡呷降泽，瞻化县土司甲日尼马等说：当五星红旗插到金沙江东岸后，西岸的藏族人民经常偷偷地泅过江来，要求解放军赶快渡江；东岸的同胞也自动供应粮草牲畜，争取早日解放彼岸的弟兄。今天昌都虽已解放，西藏人民还没有摆脱帝国主义的羁绊，还待我们的努力。
    康定塔公寺日库活佛、甘孜大金寺多吉泽仁等以康定地区解放后的亲身体验指出：人民政府的民族平等、宗教信仰自由等政策，已获得广大藏族人民的拥护和爱戴；拉萨当局应当认清真理，不要误信帝国主义分子的造谣污蔑，赶快争取全藏的和平解放。
    【新华社五日讯】留京藏族人士计晋美、李春先、散丹嘉错等十余人，于四日举行拥护进军西藏、庆祝昌都解放、反对帝国主义阻挠西藏解放的座谈会。与会者笑容满面，情绪异常兴奋。他们争相发言，欢庆西藏同胞即将获得解放。计晋美热烈表示拥护人民解放军进军西藏，从帝国主义者手中把西藏同胞解放出来。李春先指出在国民党反动派统治时期，少数民族是受到压迫和歧视的，现在在中央人民政府、毛主席和中国共产党领导下，少数民族才得到了真正的平等。少数民族的宗教信仰和风俗习惯都受到了尊重。青海、甘肃、西康各地已解放了的藏族居住区中，寺院、喇嘛都受到保护。这种铁的事实，彻底粉碎了帝国主义和国民党反动派的无耻挑拨和造谣。与会者一致表示只有跟着毛主席走，藏族同胞才能得到解放。他们号召西藏的人民和爱国人士团结起来，粉碎帝国主义阴谋分子的阻挠，投向祖国的温暖大家庭中来。最后，与会者全体起立高呼口号，拥护进军西藏，庆祝昌都解放。
