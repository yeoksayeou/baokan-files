(Reported by this newspaper) Commanders and fighters of the Third Regiment of the Central Column of the Chinese People's Public Security Forces extremely hate the fact that American imperialism is spreading the flames of war in Korea to the border of our motherland. More than 270 commanders and fighters have written resolutions expressing their iron will to resist American aggression, support the Korean people, and defend the motherland. Many soldiers angrily bit their fingers to take an oath. This newspaper has received these two hundred-plus resolutions, and excerpts are published below:

I have fully recognized the American imperialists' insidious schemes
I want to resolutely resist America and aid Korea to defend the motherland
Now the American imperialists are determined to expand their war of aggression, and the flames of war have spread to the border of the motherland. I have fully recognized its insidious schemes. It wants to annex the whole world and enslave the people of the world. It has especially great aggressive ambitions towards our China. I am a Chinese youth. I have suffered cruel oppression from Japanese imperialism and lived the life of a beast of burden for fourteen years. The suffering I endured is endless. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous bandit gang colluded with American imperialism to come to China and run rampant, raping female university students, and cars ran over people at will. American imperialism invaded Korea and sent planes to our Chinese airspace to strafe and bomb several times, killing and wounding our compatriots. I deeply understand its crimes. The blood of our compatriots cannot be shed in vain, and we cannot tolerate this kind of bullying. I want to resolutely avenge our dead compatriots. I would rather sacrifice myself than see the Korean people suffer further aggression, and I will not let an inch of territory be lost.
                Lin Guodong

I have lived a life of slavery for decades in the past
I must never be oppressed by imperialism again
After more than twenty years of revolutionary struggle, the mainland of our country has been basically liberated. The people of our country have just been rescued from suffering; the people have initially achieved adequate food and clothing. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can we have today's happiness.

Our country has now become a new China, and various constructions are underway. But at this time, the American imperialists' frantic acts of aggression continue to expand, not only wanting to invade Korea, but also wanting to burn the flames of war to our motherland: repeatedly violating our airspace, bombing our people, and seriously threatening us. We have lived a life of slavery for decades, and we are determined not to be subjected to imperialist aggression and rule again. I want to resolutely fight to the death with the despicable and shameless American imperialists. I request to go to the border of the motherland to eliminate those American aggressors.
              Wang Yutang

In order to defend the fruits of victory, I voluntarily joined the army
If the American imperialists dare to invade, we will resolutely fight them
We are the defenders of the motherland and the defenders of the capital. When American imperialism wants to invade our beloved motherland today, we feel boundless anger and can no longer tolerate it! In the past, we suffered the oppression of Japanese devils and endured all kinds of hardships. The Communist Party rescued us from suffering, liberated us, and allowed us to live a happy life. In order to defend our freedom, happiness, and the fruits of victory, we voluntarily joined the People's Liberation Army. Thanks to the correct and wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries. Just as we wanted to restore and build our beloved motherland, American imperialism wanted to launch a war again. It is now not only invading our neighbor Korea, but also wants to invade China from Korea. We are truly filled with hatred when we hear about this adventurous act of aggression. We will dedicate all our strength and all our spirit to defend our motherland and eliminate the American aggressors. We will spare no sacrifice!

Chinese young revolutionary soldiers have a responsibility to protect the motherland's security
Now American imperialism is single-mindedly trying to invade our motherland. I am a young revolutionary soldier of China and have a responsibility to protect the security of the motherland. Here, I swear to the people of the whole country: For the sake of the security of the motherland, I resolutely oppose the American imperialist war of aggression. And I am determined to sacrifice my personal body to defeat the American imperialist aggression.
                  Gao Yingjie

Willing to use flesh and blood to forge a giant hammer
Resolutely strike the American robbers
We are the defenders of the people and the guards of Chairman Mao. We have already signed the peace declaration. In order to ensure the independence of the new China and the safety of the people of the world, we are willing to cast our flesh and blood into a giant iron hammer to resolutely strike the American robbers.

The American imperialists' frantic flames of aggression in Korea have already burned to the gate of our country. Our China is no longer a country that can be humiliated by anyone. We can no longer tolerate the American imperialists' repeated acts of aggression such as bombing and strafing our country. We must resolutely smash the American imperialists' atrocities and avenge our dead compatriots.

We must resolutely suppress saboteurs
Undertake the great task of the National Defense Forces
The American imperialists' acts of aggression make us unable to endure it any longer. Didn't Foreign Minister Zhou have a statement long ago? We will never tolerate any imperialist insults, nor can we stand idly by while any imperialists invade our neighbors. We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, and we will use practical actions to shatter the American aggression conspiracy. We will never let domestic saboteurs cause trouble, resolutely suppress them, undertake the great task of the internal defense forces, and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship. In the course of the struggle, we can sacrifice all personal interests and contribute to the cause of the people of the world for peace.
        Second Battalion, Sixth Company, Second Platoon, Sixth Squad

Resolutely defend the motherland and defend a beautiful life
Not allowing American imperialism to invade an inch of our land
Now American imperialism is expanding its war of aggression, which I truly hate! I have read Chinese history, and I have personally suffered and witnessed the brutal behavior of American imperialist aggressors. They helped the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang kill countless patriotic people, and their blood stained our land. On the evening of October 29th this year, I received a deeper education. I watched the newsreel documentary of North Korea. In the beautiful neighboring country of Korea, there were countless young people, teenagers, and children who were living a happy and free life. Countless farmers and workers were actively working to build their own country, building solemn, beautiful, tidy, and prosperous big cities, factories, schools, and so on. However, the hateful American imperialist aggressors actually used Korean cities and factories as battlefields, massacred countless peaceful Korean people, and committed all kinds of evil deeds such as rape, arson, killing, and looting. This kind of behavior is truly infuriating. During this period, my compatriots in Northeast China were also killed and wounded by the American imperialists. The blood of the dead cannot be shed in vain. We must turn hatred into strength and avenge the American imperialists.

Now American imperialism is burning the flames of war to the border of the motherland, trying to further invade our country and enslave our people. This is something we absolutely cannot tolerate. The establishment of our People's Republic of China was bought with blood and sweat. I am a Chinese youth, and I would rather die than be a slave to American imperialism. Once the motherland is invaded, I will resolutely fight it to the end. Resolutely defend the integrity of the motherland's territory and defend the people's happy and fulfilling life.
                  Zhu Qingzhen

I am willing to stand on the front lines of the Korean people
And fight against American imperialism with the Korean People's Army
I recently read in the newspaper that American imperialism is frantically invading our friendly country of Korea, and is also threatening the security of our motherland and the people of the world. I can no longer endure it. I want to wipe our cannons clean and request to stand on the front lines of the Korean people to jointly crush the American imperialists' aggressive conspiracy. I am willing to dedicate my whole body to the people. I want to resolutely defeat American imperialism, I want to twist off its bloody hands, I want to defend world peace, I want to protect our motherland, I want to avenge!
                Jiang Zhifu

Must pull out the teeth of the American imperialist mad dog
And drive it onto the road to Hitler's demise
I am a guard soldier. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, I have raised my class consciousness and recognized the class enemies. Especially now, when I see the American imperialists' frantic aggression in the newspaper, it truly makes me extremely angry! The American invading troops in Korea have now burned the flames of war to the doorstep of our motherland. We are the defenders of the motherland, we are the soldiers who defend peace, I am a Communist Party member, now that the great enemy is at hand, we Communist Party members must bravely step forward. I want to dedicate my life to the revolution, dedicate myself to the Party, to defend the sacred territory of our motherland. I would rather have my body die on the border of the motherland than let the American devils invade an inch of our motherland's territory. The American imperialist mad dog wants to bite whoever it sees. This time we must pull out its biting teeth and not let it go mad in our world again. We must drive it onto the road to Hitler's demise. I guarantee to Chairman Mao, I guarantee to the people of the whole country, I guarantee to the peace-loving people of the world: I will not be satisfied until the blood-sucking devils in the world are driven into the sea! I am determined to bravely advance, defend the border of the motherland, keep a good eye on the gate, and not let these arsonist murderers step into our motherland.
                Qian Zhendong

We can no longer tolerate the American imperialists' arrogant aggression
Determined to beat it until it is battered and bloody and rolls into the sea
In the past, under the iron hooves of Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries and feudal landlords, we Chinese people lived a painful life worse than beasts of burden in the dark, suffering all kinds of bullying and oppression. The Communist Party liberated us, led us to overthrow the landlords and turn ourselves over, and participated in the ranks of the people themselves under the wise leadership of the Communist Party. After four years of liberation war, the Kuomintang reactionaries were overthrown. We have a free and happy new China. Now that our new China has just begun construction, American imperialism will not allow our peace-loving people to build safely, but is expanding its war of aggression, invading our neighbor Korea, and invading our Taiwan, repeatedly violating our airspace, killing and wounding our people, and destroying our buildings. I can no longer continue to endure this unreasonable and fierce act of aggression. I am determined to stand together with the Korean people, oppose the American imperialists' acts of aggression, and never let it invade an inch of our territory. I want to work with the Korean people to beat the American imperialist beasts until they are battered and bloody and roll into the sea.

　　中央公安纵队某部指战员
    写下保卫祖国决心书
    志愿抗美援朝不准敌人到我国来放火
    【本报讯】中国人民公安部队中央纵队第三团的指战员，极端痛恨美帝把侵朝战火向我祖国边境延烧，前后有二百七十余名指战员写下了决心书，表示反抗美帝侵略、支援朝鲜人民和保卫祖国的钢铁意志，有不少战士愤怒地咬破了自己的手指宣誓。本报收到这二百余封决心书，兹选登如下：
    我完全认清了美帝侵略鬼计
    我要坚决抗美援朝保卫祖国
    现在美帝决心扩大侵略战争，战争的火焰已燃烧到祖国边疆，它的阴谋鬼计我完全认清了，它想吞并全世界，要拿全世界人民做奴隶，它尤其对我们中国的侵略野心很大。我是中国的青年，我曾经受过日本帝国主义残酷的压迫，过了十四年的牛马生活，我受的苦，说也说不完。蒋介石卖国匪帮勾结美帝来到中国横行霸道，强奸大学女学生，汽车随意轧死人，美帝侵略朝鲜，几次派飞机到我中国领空扫射轰炸，杀伤我同胞，它的罪恶我深深的体会到了。我们同胞的鲜血不能白流，我们不能忍受这种欺侮，我要坚决替我们死难的同胞报仇。我宁可自己牺牲也不愿看朝鲜人民再受侵略，也不叫领土失去一寸。
                林国栋
    我过去已过了几十年奴隶生活
    决不能再受帝国主义的压迫了
    经过二十余年的革命斗争，我国大陆已得到了基本解放。我国人民刚由苦难中被搭救出来；人民已初步的得到丰衣足食。只有共产党的领导，我们才得有今天的幸福。
    我国现已成为新中国，各项建设正在进行。但是正在这时，美帝疯狂侵略的行为继续扩大，不但想侵略朝鲜，而且想把战争火焰燃烧到我们的祖国：屡次侵犯我领空，轰炸我人民，严重的威胁我们。我们已经过了几十年的奴隶生活，我们坚决再不能受帝国主义的侵略和统治，我要坚决的和卑鄙无耻的美帝作决死斗争。我要求到祖国的边疆，消灭那些美国侵略者。
              王玉堂
    为了保卫胜利果实我自动参了军
    美帝敢来侵犯我们就坚决和他拚
    我们是祖国的保卫者，也是首都的保卫者。当今天美帝国主义想侵略我们可爱的祖国的时候，我们感到无限愤怒，是再也不能容忍啦！我们在过去受日本鬼子的压迫，受尽了千辛万苦。共产党把我们从苦难中解救出来，使我们得到解放，过着幸福的生活。我们为了保卫我们的自由幸福和胜利的果实，就自动的参加了人民解放军。由于毛主席领导的正确与英明，打败了国民党反动派。我们刚想恢复和建设我们可爱的祖国的时候，美帝国主义又想发动战争。它现在不但在侵略我们的邻邦朝鲜，还想从朝鲜来侵略我们中国。它这种冒险的侵略行为，我们听到真是恨之入骨，我们将献出全部力量和全部的精神，保卫我们的祖国，消灭美国侵略者，我们将不惜任何的牺牲！
    袁永林  李国臣  李国有  郑万财  薛文学  林政奎　卜垚亮  孙常荣  郭有贵  赵广信
    中国青年革命战士有责任保卫祖国安全
    现在美帝一心一意的要侵略我们祖国。我是中国的青年革命战士，有责任保卫祖国安全。在这里我向全国人民宣誓：为了祖国的安全，坚决反对美帝的侵略战争。我并有决心牺牲个人的肉身，前去打败美帝的侵略。
                  高应节
    愿以血肉铸成巨锤
    坚决打击美国强盗
    我们是人民的保卫者，是毛主席的警卫战士。我们已在和平宣言上签了名。为了确保新中国的独立和全世界人民的安全，我们愿把我们的血肉铸成巨大的铁锤，坚决打击美国强盗。
    美帝疯狂的侵朝火焰已烧到了我国的大门。我们中国已再不是一个可以任人侮辱的国家了。我们已不能容忍美帝一再对我国的轰炸扫射等侵略行为。我们要坚决粉碎美帝的暴行，为死难的同胞报仇。
              警通连电话班
    我们要坚决镇压破坏分子
    担负起国防军的伟大任务
    美帝国主义的侵略行为，使我们再也不能忍受了，周外长不是早就有声明吗？我们决不能忍受任何帝国主义的侮辱，我们也不能听任任何帝国主义对我们的邻人侵略而置之不理。我们坚决拥护周外长的声明，我们要以实际行动来粉碎美国的侵略阴谋。我们决不让国内的破坏分子捣乱，坚决镇压他们，担起内防军的伟大任务，巩固人民民主专政。在进行斗争中，我们可以牺牲一切个人利益，贡献给全世界人民为争取和平的事业。
        二营六连二排六班
    坚决保卫祖国保卫美好生活
    不让美帝侵略我国一寸土地
    现在美帝扩大侵略战争，我真是愤恨它！我读了中国历史，我亲自受到和看到过美帝侵略者的残暴行为，它帮助蒋介石匪帮杀死我无数爱国人民，鲜血染遍了我们的国土。今年十月二十九日晚，对我教育更深，我看到北朝鲜的新闻电影记录片，在美丽的邻邦朝鲜，有着无数的青年、少年和儿童，都过着美满自由的生活；那无数农民和工人都在积极劳动建设自己祖国，修建了庄严、美丽、整齐、繁荣的大城市和工厂学校等。但是，可恨的美帝国主义侵略者，竟把朝鲜城市和工厂当作战场，屠杀了无数朝鲜和平的人民，奸淫、烧、杀、抢，无恶不作，这种行为，真叫人说不出来的愤恨。在这时期我东北的同胞，也被美帝杀伤了不少，死难的血是不能白流的，我们一定要把仇恨变为力量，向美帝报仇。
    现在美帝把战争的火焰燃烧到祖国的边疆，想进一步侵入我国，奴役我国人民，这是我们绝不能容忍的。我们中华人民共和国的建立是血汗换来的，我是中国的青年，宁死不作美帝的奴隶。一旦祖国受到侵略，我就坚决和它斗争到底。坚决保卫祖国领土完整，保卫人民的美满幸福生活。
                  朱庆珍
    我愿站在朝鲜人民的前线上
    和朝鲜人民军一起打垮美帝
    我最近从报纸上看到美帝国主义疯狂地侵略我们友邦朝鲜，同时也威胁着我们祖国和全世界人民的安全。我再不能忍受下去了。我要把我们的炮擦好，要求站在朝鲜人民的前线上，和朝鲜人民军共同粉碎美帝的侵略阴谋。我愿把我全身贡献给人民，我要坚决打垮美帝国主义，我要把它的血手拧下来，我要保卫世界和平，我要保护我们的祖国，我要报仇！
                蒋志福
    一定要把美帝疯狗牙齿拔掉
    把它赶上希特勒灭亡的道路
    我是一个警卫战士，我在毛主席的领导下，提高了阶级觉悟，认清了阶级敌人。特别是现在，我在报纸上看到了美帝国主义的疯狂侵略，这真使我愤怒万分！美国侵朝军队，现在已经把战火烧到了我们祖国大门口。我们是祖国的保卫者，我们是保卫和平的战士，我是一个共产党员，现在大敌当头，我们共产党员要奋不顾身，挺身而起。我要终身献身革命，献身给党，来保卫我们祖国神圣的国土。我宁愿把我的肉体死于祖国的边疆上，也不能叫美国鬼子把我们祖国的一尺一寸国土侵略去。美帝国主义这只疯狗，见谁就想咬谁，这回我们一定把它咬人的牙拔掉，再也不能让它在我们世界上发疯了。我们一定要把它赶上希特勒的灭亡路上去。我向毛主席保证，我向全国人民保证，向全世界爱好和平的人民保证：不把世界上的吸人血的魔鬼打到海里，我是不甘心的！我坚决要奋勇前进，保卫祖国的边疆，看好大门，不叫这些放火的凶手踏进我们祖国来。
                钱振东
    美帝横蛮侵略我们再也不能容忍
    决心把它打得头破血流滚下海去
    我们中国人民过去在日本帝国主义和国民党反动派及封建地主的铁蹄压榨下，在黑暗中过着牛马不如的痛苦生活，受尽了欺侮压榨。共产党把我们解放出来，领导我们打倒地主翻了身，参加了在共产党英明领导之下的人民自己的队伍。经过四年解放战争，打倒了国民党反动派。我们有了自由幸福的新中国。现在我们新中国刚开始建设，美帝国主义却不叫我们爱好和平的人民安全建设，又在扩大侵略战争、侵略我们的邻邦朝鲜，并且侵略我国台湾，数次侵犯我国领空，杀伤我国人民，击毁我们的建筑物。它这种蛮不讲理的凶狠侵略行为，使我再也不能继续忍受下去了。我坚决要和朝鲜人民站在一起，反对美帝的侵略行为，决不叫它侵犯我们一寸领土。我要和朝鲜人民一起，把美帝侵略野兽打得头破血流，滚到海里去。
