Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 18th: The Second World Peace Congress continued its meeting on the 17th. 1,396 delegates attended yesterday's opening ceremony. Delegates from Italy, the British-occupied zone of Germany, and other representatives arrived in Warsaw on November 17 to attend the Congress. The presence of young men and women in blue uniforms - members of the Free German Youth League - attracted universal attention. They had experienced all the horrors of American and British police rule in West Germany before arriving here. Some of them had just come out of prison. They had suffered imprisonment for participating in the struggle for peace and for a unified, democratic Germany.
　　
At the beginning of the morning session, representative Deschamps announced: According to the decision of the Presidium, the list of representatives presiding over the Congress meeting is as follows:
　　
Mrs. Gordon (France), Bernal (England), Guo Moruo (China), Toledano (Mexico), Hague (United States), Street (Australia), D'Arboussier (Africa), Fadeyev (Soviet Union), Farge (France), Nenni (Italy).
　　
The Congress unanimously decided to add the following representatives to the Presidium: United States: Robinson, Willard, Hague, Johnson, Kingsbury, Proctor, Moore, Heim; Africa: Burke; Romania: Bishop Sebastian of Moldavia; Denmark: Nexo; Italy: L'Hore, Imodo, Asci, Rebassi.
　　
Joliot-Curie Report
　　
Next, Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, delivered a report on the general activities of the peace movement since the First World Peace Congress, and on expanding the peace movement in the face of the growing threat of war.
　　
Reviewing the activities of the Standing Committee and its affiliated organizations, Joliot-Curie said: Strangely enough, only a few years after the end of the war, the danger of a new world conflict has arisen again. Faced with this new danger of world conflict, we especially need to unite all the forces in the world that can oppose the looming disaster.
　　
Joliot-Curie said: We must take into account the experience already gained, and we must call on all those who do not want the horrors of war to be repeated (especially those who have fought and suffered) to fight for peace.
　　
Although we have not completely destroyed the threat of war, I think it is not an exaggeration to say that this movement of great significance has developed, and that the movement itself will turn into one that will fundamentally eliminate our conscientious fear of a new massacre - if we wish it and use enough sharpness, courage, and perseverance.
　　
Joliot-Curie went on to discuss the events that had taken place since the First World Peace Congress. He said: The actions stipulated in the declaration of the First Congress have been put into practice all over the world, and we have seen how all those who understand the seriousness of the danger of war, all those who agree to act according to these main principles aimed at preventing this danger, have united. This declaration was, is, and will remain proof of our sincere desire for peace, and it is sufficient to prove that our actions are entirely for the consolidation of peace, and that we never seek to become advocates of any particular political and economic system.
　　
After the First Congress, the German Democratic Republic was declared established, and China gained its freedom. And the whole world held an International Day of Struggle for Peace on October 2, 1949. At the Rome meeting held at the end of last October, the Standing Committee elected by the First World Peace Congress summarized the initial results of its activities and announced that at that time, public opinion fully supported the Committee's appeal to the parliaments and governments of countries responsible for their own policies. Recommendations for maintaining peace were formulated and published, and a special delegation submitted the recommendations to the parliaments and governments of many countries. However, not all delegations were received. Some delegations were received, but the recommendations they submitted were rejected. In other cases, the recommendations were approved and accepted.
　　
From the point of view of informing the citizens of various countries, this first appeal was valuable; at the same time, it made it possible for us to know for sure the attitude of this or that government. However, while further uniting and organizing the peace forces of the world, the "Cold War" became increasingly tense.
　　
On the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons and Disarmament
　　
Joliot-Curie spoke of U.S. President Truman's "arrogant declaration" about the invention of the hydrogen bomb, and the directive on the production of this weapon. He said: Action must be taken, and the problem must be raised clearly and urgently. This problem existed in the past, and at the same time, we must admit that it exists now. This is the problem of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction of mankind. The agreement passed by the three foreign ministers - Bevin, Byrnes, and Molotov - in Moscow on December 27, 1945, referred to this atomic weapon. The agreement required the committee that could have been established in the United Nations to draw up detailed special recommendations to remove atomic weapons and all other major types of weapons of mass destruction of mankind from the armaments of various countries.
　　
While making this request, it is necessary to insist on the establishment of strict international control to ensure the implementation of the agreements signed. Finally, the government that violates this agreement must be regarded as a criminal in accordance with the international judicial practice determined at the Nuremberg International Court Conference. The committee did this work when it issued the Stockholm Declaration on March 19, 1950.
　　
People are listening to this declaration, as can be proved by the hundreds of millions of signatures that have already been collected, and millions more will be added, and certainly will be added.
　　
Based on the simple and clear recommendations drawn up in Stockholm, specialized national discussions on the issue of defending peace have been launched in various countries. People's hearts are stirred up. Many people gradually realize that they are in danger, and that they can use their active actions to stop the looming danger, and then completely eliminate this danger. The congresses of various countries began to unite an increasing number of people who had not even thought of discussing this issue a few months ago.
　　
The meetings of the national congresses for defending peace carefully considered and discussed the issues raised in Prague and the decisions passed on these issues. These congresses elected their representatives to participate in the Second World Peace Congress. The representatives of the Second World Peace Congress represent a larger number of men and women with extremely different religious beliefs, ideas, and professions than the First Congress. Our movement was already very broad when it was founded, and its strength and scale have grown during the two Peace Congresses.
　　
Of course, we are not unanimous on all issues, and our political, moral, and philosophical ideas may be different. But we are all deeply convinced that it is essential to unite and jointly discuss and formulate methods that can prevent new armed conflicts.
　　
Joliot-Curie went on to elaborate on the demand for the prohibition of atomic weapons and the necessity of establishing strict control on an international scale by qualified personnel, and the possibility of reaching an agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons.
　　
Joliot-Curie said: This issue is the most important issue, because it is related to the most direct and serious threat, which makes the possibility of life on our planet itself a problem. But this does not mean that since we are focusing so much attention on the issue of atomic weapons, we should not express our greatest anxiety about the great danger of other types of weapons. And this danger can be clearly seen from the destruction of the last war.
　　
The decision to reduce armaments - this is the first stage towards universal disarmament. The implementation of such a decision is only possible after a thorough investigation of existing armaments (including atomic weapons). After the establishment of permanent international control to supervise the implementation of this decision, the implementation of these measures will ensure that every country can obtain information about the situation in other countries, will make it possible to avoid surprising speculations and fears, will promote the restoration of mutual trust, ease international tensions, and will immediately alleviate the financial situation of all countries.
　　
Naturally, all this must first prohibit offensive weapons - atomic weapons, otherwise it will become a potential force that is more terrifying day by day during this transition period.
　　
Joliot-Curie continued: It is easier to implement social repression under the pretext of the threat of aggression. With this pretext, some people can be labeled as criminals, agitators, or traitors, whose entire crime lies in their opposition to social injustice and their outspokenness in pointing out dangers, especially the profits gained from the arms race. These despicable intentions that endanger the cause of peace will surely arouse indignation among all honest people. We expose them, and we will continue to expose them, which also partly explains why we are attacked and insulted.
　　
On the Issue of Arming Germany
　　
Joliot-Curie went on to point out: The development of the situation even emphasizes the more tragic danger of the arms race, especially when Germany also participates in this race.
　　
Joliot-Curie reviewed the main principles of the policy towards Germany that were determined in Yalta, later confirmed in Potsdam, and more precisely defined, and said that these principles had been violated as early as 1946. The tycoons who had supported and armed Hitler and should have been held accountable have been re-employed and restored to their former positions in the Ruhr. Joliot-Curie said: Don't we ask ourselves what reasons are forcing them to restore the German Wehrmacht in such a hurry? Don't we have to be afraid of this, especially at present? It is now very clear that these new legions in Germany will undertake the task of: liberating Prague from Czech trusteeship and liberating Alsace from French fetters.
　　
It seems to me that the most desirable decision is to reaffirm the elimination of German militarism, and we must consider ways to implement this decision. In order to eliminate any possibility of suspicion, control and thorough investigation are necessary. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to obtain the full support of those who have fought against Hitlerism. It is better to reach an agreement on maintaining a disarmed Germany than to conduct another war in order to take the armaments that will be given to Germany in the future from its hands.
　　
On the Korean War
　　
When discussing the Korean War, Curie said: This war is a sad example of conflict, and there are many different views on this conflict - different views provoked by the aggressors. Even if we have different views on the circumstances related to the launch of this war, we should first support any measures that can be taken or can be taken now to end this conflict. Specifically, we should regard Nehru's proposal to localize the conflict and promote a rapid peaceful resolution as an action to defend peace. Nehru's proposal was immediately supported by Marshal Stalin, but after three appeals, it was rejected by Secretary of State Acheson. We must immediately mobilize broad public opinion to insist on restoring the procedures that respect the letter and spirit of the United Nations Charter. Now is the time to act, because the Korean War is a dangerous place that may cause a world conflict.
　　
On the Prohibition of War Propaganda
　　
Joliot-Curie then summarized the decision of the Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress in Prague - requiring representatives attending the Second World Peace Congress to discuss the issue of prohibiting all kinds of war propaganda in all countries. Joliot-Curie said: This systematic propaganda is also trying to create a war psychology, persuading people to believe that war is inevitable, and providing so-called "moral reasons" for the policy of force that will only cause a new world war.
　　
Joliot-Curie said: The attacks, lies, and slanders of war advocates cannot shake us, because we have no worries about inconsistency in word and deed. Peace fighters do not pretend to be believers in a certain system, and do not intend to become police or watchdogs whose purpose is to prevent people from living according to their wishes and choosing systems and governments. Our only task is to timely awaken the international conscience to avoid the disaster of war. Our duty is to conduct a relentless struggle against criminal war propaganda. At the same time, we must encourage every action that promotes the establishment of peaceful cooperation among all ethnic groups. In this regard, the United Nations Charter clearly stipulates the development of economic and cultural relations between countries. We believe that it is possible and desirable to establish such relations among all countries, regardless of their systems, because economically, the world is "a unit." If new obstacles constantly hinder the establishment of normal economic relations today as yesterday, then reasons for waging war will be found again.
　　
We must expose all measures aimed at depriving people of independence through the Marshall Plan or any other plan. We must expose any violations of the United Nations Charter.
　　
It is very clear that cultural exchanges will facilitate the rapid understanding of each other's lives by the people of various countries, and will eliminate many biases and prejudices.
　　
In science and technology, the mutual exchange of existing achievements will accelerate progress and help create various conditions conducive to maintaining peace.
　　
On the Principle of Unanimity Among Major Powers
　　
Joliot-Curie then addressed the plan proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Acheson at the United Nations a few days ago to oppose so-called aggression. Joliot-Curie said that this amendment was fundamentally due to the desire to undermine the right of "veto."
　　
The principle of striving for unanimity among major powers on resolutions of great importance to maintaining peace - that is to say, striving for cooperation between different systems, rather than attempting to obtain a docile majority through direct or indirect pressure. Once this main rule is forgotten, they will immediately stop seeking ways of cooperation and turn to seeking ways of oppression, and then seek ways that can legalize the preemptive war advocated by Mr. Matthews.
　　
I think that among the events that have occurred since our First Congress, the destruction of the United Nations Charter is the most serious and dangerous one.
　　
One of our basic tasks must be to desire to restore the true United Nations Charter; this charter was formulated by the people themselves and must reflect the efforts of the people.
　　
Joliot-Curie said: In short, we can say today that the actions of peace fighters not only limit the development of war plans, but often crush them. Now that war provocateurs are facing the failure of their fatal plans, they can no longer conceal the success of our actions and their anxiety. They are so anxious that the measures they have taken have aroused the indignation of all honest people, thereby helping those who did not believe in the importance and sincerity of our actions in the past to open their eyes.
　　
Peace fighters are increasingly determined to oppose these despicable incitements of war mongers with their will to defend peace. Peace fighters do not resort to force, and they do not want to advocate peace through destruction and death. The calm determination that is unique to all our actions is proof of our trust in human reason, and it does not indicate that we are timid in the face of threats.
　　
It is very clear that in a conference like ours that reflects the various trends of world opinion, we must gradually find common views necessary for organizing concerted action. We encounter many difficult problems, and we must solve these problems. We must consider supporting other international organizations that take strong and legitimate measures to defend peace.
　　
Joliot-Curie finally said: The results of the Congress's work must be told to the people of the world. Therefore, the declaration and resolutions of the Congress must be reviewed and approved by the people's congresses in various places. Many delegations can appeal to parliaments, governments, and the United Nations organizations. I am deeply convinced that the Congress and the committee you will elect can discover new ways of activity.
　　
It cannot be allowed to let the past suffering be in vain. It cannot be allowed to let people use the forces of nature they have conquered to destroy themselves. Precisely because we sincerely and objectively fight for peace, we will be stronger than our enemies, and we will be able to timely awaken the international consciousness that can victoriously oppose war.
　　
Speeches by Representatives of Poland, Italy, and France
　　
Professor Infeld, the Polish representative who spoke next, said: There is no "iron curtain" between our representatives from the East and the West. We may have differences on the issue of national systems, but these differences are not important compared to what unites us. We want peace for the whole world. We believe that peace will eventually prevail. I am proud and happy that the great call for peace that spreads throughout the world comes from here, from Warsaw. The reconstruction of the war damage caused by the Hitlerites makes people think of the indomitable will of people to create and build. The people who are building must believe that peace will triumph over war, and that everything they create will never turn into ruins.
　　
In his conclusion, Infeld said: All scientists should understand that a war that uses the weapons of murder they themselves have invented will set civilization back many centuries and will lead to indescribable suffering and destruction. Now is the time to understand this. Scientists must first remember that the people of the world do not want war, that there is no problem that cannot be solved peacefully, that the two systems can coexist peacefully, and that science cannot agree with the myth of the "iron curtain." Let the call of scientists resound throughout the world from here. Let the call for peace awaken more and more people all over the world.
　　
Gagliardi, an Italian Catholic priest, said: I am here to express the wishes of millions of Italian Catholics and hundreds of priests who are now alarmed by the current situation. The forces that are trying to launch a war even want to use the power of my church to implement their disastrous plans.
　　
Gagliardi continued: We all come from different countries, and we all devoutly believe in different religions, but there is one goal that unites us. Hundreds of millions of people, hundreds of millions of poor people are waiting for our speeches, let us all unite and unite the people of all religions. Although we are located in different places, we are all fighting for one goal, we can write a law, and we must move towards full unity in the action of defending peace.
　　
Mrs. Gordon, the French representative, stepped onto the podium in a storm of applause. Mrs. Gordon first thanked the Polish people and the Polish government for their warm hospitality to the representatives attending the meeting. She said: In Warsaw, this city of martyrs, peace fighters will better understand the true meaning of their activities and will be able to find concrete ways to avoid the threat of a third world war.
　　
Mrs. Gordon pointed out: The possibility of a new world war has never been as imminent as it has been since the outbreak of the Korean War. She added: In this unfortunate country, countless terrible massacres of innocent people are taking place. Mrs. Gordon quoted an article by Favrel, a military reporter for the French newspaper Le Monde, as proof. Favrel described the situation in August when the U.S. military systematically destroyed Korean villages, saying: "Groups of planes constantly bombed for two hours, leveling the villages to the ground. Seeing the sunny village scene instantly turn into a place of death, witnessing the soldiers die one after another to seize a hundred meters of land, and thinking of the unfortunate women and children in despair not far away, I do not feel proud to be a member of mankind."
　　
Mrs. Gordon described in detail the participation of women from various countries in the peace movement, and said: This universal desire of women to strive for peace has found a practical and effective explanation in the work of collecting signatures for the Stockholm Declaration. For women who nurture mankind, the atomic bomb is an evil thing that despises human life. This explains why many women signed the declaration, which explains why women widely promoted the declaration and obtained so many signatures through various propaganda methods.
　　
Mrs. Gordon cited many examples of women's selfless actions. They organized the signature movement for the Stockholm Declaration in Argentina, France, the United States, India, Italy, and other countries under the police terror.
　　
Mrs. Gordon mentioned the proposal of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the Women's International Democratic Federation to designate June 1 of this year as the International Day for the Protection of Children. She read out several letters of entrustment from peace fighters to their representatives attending the Second World Peace Congress.
　　
In her conclusion, Mrs. Gordon said: We will strive to ensure that mothers will never have to mourn their sons who died in the war. Let our hearts forget hatred and be filled with the great joy given by educating children for happiness and progress. Long live peace!
　　
Cassini, Chairman of the Nice Peace Committee, who spoke next, said: Although Nice is far from Warsaw, the people of this city love peace, and with this emotion, I dedicate this bouquet of flowers to Warsaw to thank you for your hospitality to the representatives attending the meeting.
　　
Moshalova, Chairman of the Polish Women's League, said: We Polish women have endured the period of Hitler's occupation in pain. The suffering of the past war is indescribably terrible. Today, our struggle is to protect the dearest people - our children, the children of all mothers in the world, from the massacre of more terrible executioners.
　　
At that time, the Polish women's delegation entered the hall. They were wearing brightly colored national costumes. When they turned to the presidium of the conference, they repeatedly shouted in unison: "Peace! Peace! Peace!" The representatives of the conference welcomed the Polish women with a storm of applause.
　　
Jazkova, representing the delegation, delivered a speech to the conference, saying: We Polish women - workers, farmers and intellectuals, mothers and wives, have come here from all over the country to extend our sincere congratulations to the Second World Peace Congress. Polish women know what war means. None of us has not lost a loved one. In Poland, no family does not know the horrors of war and occupation. In Poland, six million men, women and children were killed, and one and a half million orphans are still mourning their parents today. Isn't sacrifice, bloodshed and suffering enough? I am not only speaking on behalf of the five hundred women who came with me to pay tribute to the conference, but also on behalf of nearly ten million Polish women who have signed the Stockholm Declaration and have shown how resolutely they are prepared to fight for peace. We will go home with deep confidence, believing that the conference can find effective ways to save our Polish mothers and children, as well as mothers and children around the world, from the doom of a new war.

　　居里报告和平运动  世界和平力量正进一步扩大团结与日益增长的战争威胁坚决斗争
    【新华社讯】塔斯社华沙十八日电：第二届世界保卫和平大会于十七日继续开会。参加昨日大会开幕式的有一千三百九十六位代表。十一月十七日赶到华沙出席大会的有意大利、德国英占区代表和其他代表。身着蓝色制服的男女青年——自由德国青年联盟盟员们的莅会，引起了全场的普遍注意。他们从西德抵达此间前，曾在西德经历过美英警察统治的一切恐怖行为。其中有些人刚刚从监狱中出来。由于参加争取和平及争取统一、民主德国的斗争，他们曾在狱中备受徒刑。
    上午会议开始时，代表德香布兰宣布：根据主席团的决定，主持大会会议的代表名单如下：
    戈登夫人（法国）、贝尔纳（英国）、郭沫若（中国）、托列达诺（墨西哥）、哈格（美国）、斯崔特（澳大利亚）、达波赛（非洲）、法捷耶夫（苏联）、法奇（法国）、南尼（意大利）。
    大会一致决定主席团增加下列代表：美国：罗滨森、魏拉德、哈格、约翰逊、金斯柏利、普罗克托、穆尔、海姆；非洲：柏克；罗马尼亚：摩尔达维亚主教塞巴斯阡；丹麦：尼克索；意大利：洛尔、伊莫多、阿雪、雷巴西。
    约里奥—居里报告
    接着，世界保卫和平大会常设委员会主席约里奥—居里发表关于自第一届世界保卫和平大会以来，和平运动一般活动以及在战争威胁日益增长的情况下扩大和平运动的报告。
    约里奥—居里检讨常设委员会及其所属机构的活动称：说来奇怪，战争结束的确才不过几年，新的世界冲突的危险又发生了。面临着这种新的世界冲突的危险，我们特别需要把全世界一切能够反对日益临近的灾难的力量团结起来。
    约里奥—居里说：我们不得不考虑到已经获得的经验，不得不号召全体不愿战争恐怖重演的人们（首先是那些作过战和受过苦难的人们）为和平而斗争。
    虽然，我们还没有完全摧毁战争的威胁，但是我以为如果我们说：这一有巨大意义的运动已经有发展，而且这个运动本身将变为一个会把我们良心上对于新的大屠杀的惶恐根本消除的运动——只要我们希望如此并运用足够的锐敏的眼光、勇气和坚持不懈的话—这样说并不过分。
    约里奥—居里进而论述第一届世界保卫和平大会以来所发生的事件。他说：第一届大会宣言所规定的行动，已在世界各地付诸实行了，并且我们看到所有那些了解战争危险之严重性的人们，所有那些同意根据这些以防止这种危险为目的的主要原则而行动的人们，是怎样团结起来了。这个宣言过去是而今后仍将是我们真诚渴望和平的明证，并且足以证明：我们的行动完全是为了巩固和平，而且决不力求成为某一种政治和经济制度的鼓吹者。
    在第一届大会之后，德意志民主共和国宣布成立，中国取得了它的自由。并且全世界都在一九四九年十月二日举行了国际和平斗争日。第一届世界保卫和平大会选出的常设委员会在去年十月底举行的罗马会议上，曾总结了它的活动的初步结果，并且宣布说：当时舆论充分支持委员会向那些对它们自己的政策负责的各国议会与政府所发出的呼吁。制定了和发表了维持和平的建议，并由特别代表团把建议提交许多国家的议会与政府。但是，并不是所有的代表团都受到了接待。有些代表团虽然被接待，但它们所提交的建议则遭到拒绝。而在另外一些情况下，这些建议得到赞同并被接受。
    从使各国公民了解情况的观点来说，这第一个呼吁，是有价值的；同时，它使得我们有可能确知这一个或另一个政府的态度。但是，与进一步团结和组织全世界的和平力量同时，“冷战”也日趋紧张了。
    关于禁止原子武器与裁减军备
    约里奥—居里谈到美国总统杜鲁门关于发明氢弹的“狂妄声明”，及关于生产这一武器的训令。他说：必须采取行动，必须把问题明白而迫切地提出来。这个问题在过去是存在的，同时我们必须承认它在现在也是存在的。这是原子武器以及他种大规模毁灭人类的武器的问题。一九四五年十二月二十七日三国外长—贝文、贝尔纳斯和莫洛托夫——在莫斯科通过的协定，曾说到这个原子武器。该协定要求本可以在联合国中成立起来的委员会详细拟定特别的建议，以便从各国军备中除去原子武器以及其他一切大规模毁灭人类的主要类型的武器。
    与提出这种要求同时，必须坚持建立严格的国际管制，以保证所签订的协定的执行。最后，必须根据纽伦堡的国际法院会议上所确定的国际司法惯例，把破坏这种协定的政府视为罪犯。委员会在一九五零年三月十九日发表斯德哥尔摩宣言，就做了这种工作。
    人们是倾听这个宣言的，这可由已经征集到的数亿人的签名中得到证明，签名以后还会增加千百万个，而且是一定会增加的。
    根据在斯德哥尔摩拟定的简单明了的建议，保卫和平问题的全国规模的专门讨论便在各国展开了。人们的心激动起来了。许多人逐渐觉察到他们是处在危险之中，而且他们能够用他们积极的行动来制止日益逼近的危险，以后并且完全消灭这一危险。各国的大会开始团结了日益众多的人民，他们在几个月以前甚至未曾想到要讨论这个问题的。
    各国的保卫和平大会的会议，详尽地考虑并讨论了在布拉格所提出的问题以及对这些问题所通过的决定。这些大会选出了他们参加第二届世界保卫和平大会的代表。第二届世界保卫和平大会的代表们比第一届大会代表着更大数目的、有极其不同的宗教信仰、思想及职业的男女们。我们的运动在创立时就已经很广泛，在两届和平大会期间，其力量与规模又有了增长。
    当然，我们并不是在一切问题上都是一致的，我们的政治、道德及哲学观念可以不同。但我们全都深信，团结起来共同讨论及共同制订能够阻止新的武装冲突的方法，是至为必要的。
    约里奥—居里进而详述关于禁止原子武器的要求与在国际规模上建立由合格人员加以执行的严格管制的必要性，以及对禁止原子武器获致协议的可能性。
    约里奥—居里说：这个问题是最重要的问题，因为它关系到最直接的、最严重的威胁，这个威胁使我们星球上的生活的可能性本身都成了问题。但是这并不意味着：既然集中这样多的注意力于原子武器的问题上，我们就不应当对其他种武器的巨大危险表示我们最大的焦虑了。而这种危险从上次战争的破坏中就可以清楚地看到了的。
    裁减军备的决定——这是走向普遍解除军备的第一阶段。这样的决定的实施，只有在清查了现存的军备（包括原子武器在内）之后才有可能。在把监督执行这一决定的永久性国际管制建立起来之后，这些措施的执行就将保证每一国家都可以获得关于其他国家情况的情报，将使得有可能避免令人惊异的臆测与疑惧，将促进相互信任的恢复，缓和国际紧张局势，并将立即减轻一切国家的财政状况。
    自然，这一切须首先要禁止侵略武器——原子武器，不然它就会在这一过渡时期成为一天比一天可怕的潜在力量。
    约里奥—居里继称：在侵略威胁的借口下实行社会性的镇压是比较容易的。凭这种借口就可以给一些人加上罪人、煽动者或卖国贼的罪名，这些人的整个的罪状就在于他们反对社会不公，并且直言不隐地指出危险，特别是指出从军备竞赛中得到的利润。这些危及和平事业的卑鄙的意图，一定会在全体正直的人民当中引起愤慨的情绪。我们揭发他们，而且还要继续揭发他们，这也就部分地说明了我们为什么受到攻击与侮辱的原故。
    关于武装德国问题
    约里奥—居里进而指出：时局的发展甚至着重表明了军备竞赛的更为悲惨的危险，尤其是当德国也参加这个竞赛的时候。
    约里奥—居里追述了在雅尔塔确定的、后来又在波茨坦加以确认和更确切地加以规定的对德政策的主要原则，并说这些原则在一九四六年就已经被违犯。那些曾经支持与武装希特勒、并且原应加以追究的大亨们，都已经被重新起用，恢复了他们以前在鲁尔的位置。约里奥—居里说：难道我们不问问自己，是什么原因迫使他们这样匆忙地恢复德国国防军吗？难道我们不必害怕这一点吗，特别是在目前？现在已经十分清楚可以看到，在德国的这些新的军团将担负这样的任务，就是：把布拉格从捷克人的托管之下解放出来，并把阿尔萨斯从法国人的桎梏下解放出来。
    在我看来最可取的决定是重申肃清德国军国主义，而且我们必须考虑实行这个决定的办法。为了消除猜疑的一切可能性，管制和彻底调查是必要的。为了达到这个目的，必须获得那些曾和希特勒主义作斗争的人们的充分支持。在保持一个解除武装的德国的问题上获致协议，比再进行一次战争以便把将来送给德国使用的军备从它手里夺过来为好。
    关于朝鲜战争问题
    居里在谈论到朝鲜战争时说：这个战争是冲突的可悲的例证，关于这种冲突存在着许多不同的看法——正是侵略者所挑起的不同的看法。即使我们对于发动这次战争的有关情况有着不同的看法，我们却应当首先支持现在可以采取或能够采取的任何办法，借以结束这种冲突。具体说来，我们应当把尼赫鲁所提出的使冲突局部化和促进迅速和平解决的建议，看作是保卫和平的行动。尼赫鲁的建议随即得到斯大林大元帅的支持，但是经过三次呼吁以后，都被艾奇逊国务卿拒绝了。我们必须立即动员广大的舆论去坚持恢复那种尊重联合国宪章的文字与精神的程序。现在是行动的时候了，因为朝鲜战争是可能引起世界冲突的危险地点。
    关于禁止战争宣传问题
    约里奥—居里继而综述世界和大常设委员会执行局布拉格会议的决定——要求参加第二届世界和大的代表们讨论在一切国家禁止各种战争宣传的问题。约里奥—居里说：这种有系统的宣传同时都在设法制造战争心理，劝说人民相信战争是不可避免的，并为只会引起新的世界战争的武力政策提供所谓“道义上的理由”。
    约里奥—居里说：战争鼓吹者的攻击、谎言和诽谤不能使我们动摇，因为我们没有言行不一致的顾虑。和平战士并不装作某种确定制度的信徒，而且不打算变成以阻挠人民按照其愿望去生活及选择制度与政府为目的的警察或看门狗。我们唯一的任务是及时地唤起国际上的良知去避免战争的灾祸。我们的职责是对犯罪的战争宣传进行无情的斗争。同时，我们必须鼓励每一个促进各族人民和平合作之建立的行动。在这一方面，联合国宪章明确地规定了各国间经济与文化关系的发展。我们认为：在所有国家间，不论它们的制度如何，建立这种关系是可能的而且是可取的，因为从经济上来讲，世界是“一个单位”。如果今天象昨天一样，经常有新的障碍阻挡正常经济关系的建立，那么，就会再度找到进行战争的理由。
    我们必须揭发一切旨在以马歇尔计划或者任何其他计划来剥夺人民的独立的措施。我们必须揭发任何违犯联合国宪章的事情。
    非常明白，文化交流将便利各国人民迅速了解彼此的生活，并将消除许多偏私与成见。
    在科学与技术方面，互相交换已有的成就将加速进步，帮助创造有利于维持和平的各种条件。
    关于大国一致原则
    约里奥—居里继而论及日前美国国务卿艾奇逊在联合国提出的反对所谓侵略的计划。约里奥—居里说，这一修改，根本上是由于想破坏“否决”的权利。
    在对维持和平有重大关系的决议上力求大国一致的原则——这就是说努力争取不同制度之间的合作，而不是说企图通过直接的或间接的压力以取得恭顺的多数。这种主要的规则一经忘记，他们就要立即停止寻求合作的办法，转而寻求压迫的办法，并且接着就寻求能够使马休斯先生所鼓吹的先发制人的战争合法化的办法。
    我认为：自从我们的第一届大会以来所发生的事件中，对联合国宪章的破坏是最严重最危险的一件。
    我们的基本任务之一必须是热望回复真正的联合国宪章；这种宪章是人民自己制订的，而且必须反映人民的努力。
    约里奥—居里称：总之，我们今天可以确言：和平战士的行动不仅限制战争计划的发展，而且常常粉碎它。现在战争挑拨者面对着他们的致命计划的失败，再也掩盖不了我们行动的成功和他们的焦虑了。他们是这样的焦虑，以至他们采取的措施已引起了一切正直人民的愤慨，从而帮助那些过去不相信我们的行动是关系重大与真诚无私的人们，也都睁开了眼睛。
    和平战士们越来越坚决地以他们保卫和平的意志来反对战争贩子的这些卑鄙的煽动。和平战士们不借助于武力，他们不是要经过毁灭和死亡来拥护和平的。我们一切行动中所特有的镇静的决心，是我们信任人类理智的证明，它决不表示我们在威胁面前怯懦。
    这是非常明白的，在象我们这样一个反映世界各种舆论倾向的大会上，我们必须逐渐找到为组织一致行动所必需的共同观点。我们遭遇到许多困难的问题，而且我们必须解决这些问题。我们必须考虑支持其他采取有力和正当的措施以保卫和平的国际组织的问题。
    约里奥—居里最后说：大会工作的结果必须告诉给全世界的人民。因此，大会的宣言以及决议必须由各地人民大会来审议并加以批准。许多代表团都可以向议会、政府以及联合国组织呼吁。我深信大会和你们将要选出的委员会，能够发现新的活动方式。
    让过去所受的痛苦成为徒然，那是不能容许的。让人民把他们所征服了的自然的力量用来毁灭他们自己，那也是不能容许的。正因为我们真诚地、客观地为和平而斗争，所以我们是会比我们的敌人强大的，并且我们能够及时地唤起那能够胜利地反对战争的国际间的觉悟。
    波意法等国代表发言
    继起发言的波兰代表英费尔德教授说：在我们东西代表之间并不存在什么“铁幕”。我们在国家制度的问题上会有分歧，但是这些分歧和那把我们团结在一起的东西相比较，是并不重要的。我们要全世界的和平。我们相信和平终将获得胜利。传遍全世界的宏大的和平呼声从此地发出，从华沙发出，我为此感到骄傲和愉快。希特勒分子所造成的战争破坏已经复兴，这使人想见人们创造和建设的不屈不挠的意志。正在建设的人民一定相信：和平将战胜战争，并且他们所创造的每一件东西决不会变成废墟。
    英费尔德在结语中称：所有的科学家都应该明了，使用他们自己所发明的杀人武器的战争将使文明倒退好多世纪，将导致难以描述的苦难和毁灭，现在，明了这一点的时候已经到了。科学家们首先要牢记，世界各国人民是不要战争的，没有不能和平解决的问题，两个制度是可以和平共存的，科学是不能同意“铁幕”的神话的。让科学家们的呼声从这里响彻全世界。让和平的呼声唤起越来越多的全世界人民。
    意大利天主教教士嘉格罗称：我在这里表示数百万意大利天主教徒和数百教士们的愿望，他们现在已对目前所造成的局势感到惊惶。力图发动战争的势力甚至还要利用我的教会的权力来实施他们灾难性的计划。
    嘉格罗继称：我们全都来自不同的国家，我们全都虔信着不同的宗教，但是有一个目的团结了我们。亿万人民、亿万贫苦者都期待着我们的发言，让我们全体团结起来，把所有各种宗教的人民团结起来。我们虽然分处各地，但是我们全都为一个目的而奋斗，我们可以写出一条法律，而且我们必定在保卫和平的行动中走向充分的团结。
    法国代表戈登夫人在暴风雨般的掌声中登上讲台。戈登夫人首先对波兰人民与波兰政府给予与会代表的热诚招待表示感谢。她说：在华沙这座烈士的城市，和平战士们将更好地体会到他们的活动的真正意义，并将能够找出具体的方法以避免第三次世界大战的威胁。
    戈登夫人指出：新的世界大战的可能性从来不曾象朝鲜战争爆发以来这样的迫在眉睫。她又说：在这个不幸的国家里正发生着屈指难数的对于无辜人民的可怕残杀。戈登夫人引用了法国《世界报》的军事记者法威尔的文章作为证明。法威尔描述了八月间美军有计划地毁灭朝鲜村庄的情形称：“成群的飞机不断地滥炸了两小时，把村庄夷为平地。看到阳光明媚的村景顷刻变为死亡的场所，目击到士兵们为了夺取一百公尺的地盘而纷纷阵亡，想念到不远的地方那些不幸的妇女与儿童们陷于绝望之境地，我并不感到身为人类一分子有什么值得骄傲。”
    戈登夫人详细地描述了各国妇女参加和平运动的情形，并称：妇女们这种普遍地争取和平的愿望在征集斯德哥尔摩宣言签名的工作中找到了实际而有效的说明。对于哺育人类的妇女来说，原子弹是蔑视人类生命的万恶的东西。这就说明为什么许多妇女在宣言上签了名，这就说明为什么妇女把这个宣言广为宣扬，以各种宣传的方法获得这样众多的签名。
    戈登夫人举出了妇女的忘我行动的许多范例。她们在警察恐怖的情况下，在阿根廷、法国、美国、印度、意大利及其他国家中组织了斯德哥尔摩宣言的签名运动。
    戈登夫人提到了世界民主青联及国际民主妇联所提出的把本年六月一日定为国际保卫儿童日的提议。她宣读了和平战士给他们参加第二届世界和大代表们的若干委托书。
    戈登夫人在结语中称：我们将努力使母亲们可以永远不要哀悼她们在战争中丧生的儿子们。让我们的心忘记憎恨，充满着教育儿童幸福和进步所给予的极大快乐。和平万岁！
    尼斯和平委员会主席卡西尼继起发言称：尼斯离华沙虽远，但这个城市的人民热爱和平，我以这种情感把这束鲜花献给华沙，答谢给予大会代表的款待。
    波兰妇女联盟主席莫沙劳娃发言说：我们波兰妇女忍痛度过了希特勒占领的时期，过去战争的苦难是可怖得无法形容的。今天我们的斗争是为了保护最亲爱的人——我们的儿童，全世界一切母亲们的儿童，使他们不受更可怖的刽子手们的屠杀。
    其时，波兰妇女代表团进入了大厅。她们穿着鲜艳的民族服装。当她们转向大会的主席团时，她们再三齐声高喊：“和平！和平！和平！”大会的代表们以暴风雨般的掌声来欢迎了波兰的妇女。
    贾兹科娃代表该代表团向大会发表演说称：我们波兰妇女——工人、农民和知识分子、母亲们和妻子们，从全国各地到这里来向第二届世界保卫和平大会致诚挚的贺意。波兰妇女深知战争意味着什么。我们当中没有一个代表没有丧失过亲人。在波兰，没有一个家庭不知道战争和占领的恐怖。在波兰，有六百万男子、妇女和儿童被杀害，一百五十万孤儿今天仍在悼念他们的父母。难道牺牲、流血和苦难还不够吗？我不仅代表和我一同前来向大会致敬的五百位妇女讲话，我还代表已在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名并已表现她们如何坚决地准备为和平而斗争的近一千万波兰妇女讲话。我们将带着深深的信心回家，相信大会能够找到有效的办法，使我们波兰的母亲们和儿童们，以及全世界的母亲和儿童们免遭新战争的厄运。
