　　Resolutely Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend Our Homes and Country
    ——Letters from Readers Across the Country to This Newspaper
    Resolutely Suppress Special Agents and Spies
    Supporting Korea is Defending the Security of Our Country

    Editor:
    American imperialism's armed aggression against Taiwan and Korea has aroused our utmost indignation. After suffering heavy blows from the Korean people, the U.S. imperialists are now engaging in reckless and adventurist military gambles, crossing the 38th parallel, advancing towards our country's Yalu River border, bombing and strafing our cities and villages, and directing special agents and bandits within our country to spread rumors, sabotage, and carry out conspiracies and assassinations. This has made our indignation even more unbearable. We, the People's Liberation Army's public security forces, standing on the glorious guard line, are determined to suppress the activities of the U.S. imperialist lackeys, special agents, and spies. And we are ready at any moment, when the motherland needs us, to engage in a decisive struggle with the American aggressors, carry forward our army's heroic and tenacious fighting tradition and revolutionary heroism, resolutely support Korea, liberate Taiwan, and fight to shatter U.S. imperialism's expansion of aggression and defend our motherland.

    Once Armed Struggle is Needed to Defend the Motherland
    I Will Join the Battle with the People of the Whole Country

    Editor:
    We recently saw in the newspapers that American planes invading Korea are constantly invading the sacred borders of our motherland, massacring our compatriots, and destroying the people's property. Today, we also saw Foreign Minister Zhou's telegram to the United Nations, accusing American planes of intruding into our Shandong coastal areas for reconnaissance and strafing. We are very angry and resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's accusation to the United Nations.
    In the past, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we shed blood and were wounded for the independence and liberation of the motherland and the freedom and happiness of the people, defeating Japanese imperialism and the U.S. imperialists and the U.S. imperialist lackey, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the people were liberated. Now, U.S. imperialism is directly slaughtering the Chinese people. We will never tolerate the U.S. imperialists' heinous acts of aggression. We resolutely express to Chairman Mao that although we are physically disabled, our will is strong. Once armed struggle is needed to defend the motherland, we will definitely take up arms with the people of the whole country and fight unremittingly to completely eliminate the American aggressors. The wounded comrades guarantee to study hard, improve their skills, participate in the various constructions of New China, stand at their posts, carry forward the fine traditions, and unite the broad masses of the people to contribute all their strength to defend the motherland!
    We unanimously shout:
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the people's leader Chairman Mao!

    Oppose U.S. Imperialism's Expansion of Aggression
    Defend Our Good Life

    Editor:
    I am a disabled veteran who moved from Hebei Province to the Northeast. When we set off, cadres and doctors escorted us and set up reception stations for us. Everyone felt very comfortable on the road, and pregnant women could safely give birth on the way.
    When we arrived at our destination, the local county party committee, county magistrate, district head, students, and various people's organizations warmly welcomed us at the station with gongs and drums. They helped us carry things, hold children, and help the elderly get off the train. The next day, various district villages sent horse-drawn carts to welcome us. There is a lot of wasteland in the Northeast, with fertile soil and convenient transportation. The local villagers have shown a high degree of class friendship, automatically donating money, lending grain, and sending firewood, and buying us many useful furniture items. The government, fearing that we would be cold, allocated a heated kang to each household and helped us engage in sideline occupations, lending us *wula* (leather boots) to go up the mountains to gather firewood. This allowed us to spend the cold winter very comfortably. This spring, spring plowing began, and the government first lent each immigrant household food, fodder, and hoes. Because reclaiming wasteland was difficult at the time, the villagers voluntarily offered mature land, allowing each immigrant household to obtain one to two *qing* of land. Because I am a disabled veteran, the village government and villagers automatically helped me cultivate the land. I planted three *qing* of land this year, and the crops are growing extremely well. The immigrants who came last year have generally raised their living standards to the level of middle peasants. Everyone generally reflects: If it weren't for Chairman Mao, we would have starved to death long ago. We will never forget the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!
    Now the immigrants have generally improved their lives. But U.S. imperialism has repeatedly violated our country's airspace, killed our compatriots, and attempted to plunge us back into the abyss of suffering. Therefore, we must not tolerate this shameless crime of U.S. imperialism. We resolutely support the statement of the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government on October 10, opposing U.S. imperialism's expansion of the war of aggression. In the future, we must work hard to produce, defend our homeland, and defend our good life!

    The People of China and Korea Have Flesh-and-Blood Ties
    We Can No Longer Let Our Brothers Suffer

    Editor:
    I am a young worker at the Beijing People's Printing Factory. I want to tell you what's on my mind. Since the U.S. imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, countless Korean people have been killed. I hate the U.S. imperialists very much, and I sympathize with the Korean people very much. The Korean people once fought alongside us to resist Japanese imperialism and won victory. This time, in their war of liberation, they bravely struck at the enemy who bombed my Northeast and prevented my representatives from participating in the Security Council - the U.S. imperialists. The Chinese people and the Korean people have such flesh-and-blood ties! Therefore, I cannot bear the U.S. imperialists' acts of aggression and the suffering of the Korean people. We cannot help but take practical actions to relieve the suffering of our brothers. Because of this, my heart is burning like fire now. We cannot wait any longer and let our brothers suffer. What is written in this letter is not only my own thoughts, but when I talked to many comrades about this issue, they all had the same thoughts as me. The comrades all said that today's China is not the China of the past. Not only can our country not be subjected to imperialist aggression, but we cannot allow imperialism to aggress against any democratic country!
    Guo Huiyou, Beijing People's Printing Factory

    If U.S. Imperialism Dares to Extend its Bloody Claws
    We Will Surely Cut Them Off

    Editor:
    When we heard the news of American planes continuously violating our country's airspace, it really made us very angry.
    The U.S. imperialists, these robbers, have consistently been enemies of the Chinese people. After their crimes of aiding the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek in massacring the Chinese people met with failure, they openly invaded our neighboring country, Korea, and our territory, Taiwan. Now they are even more frantically expanding the war of aggression, and are attempting to push the flames of war towards our border, seriously threatening our country's security. This planned act of provocation against the Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world is something we cannot tolerate.
    We shed countless blood in defeating the Japanese invaders and overthrowing the rule of Chiang Kai-shek. We will never allow any imperialists to seize our fruits of victory, nor will we allow any imperialists to infringe upon our territory. We fully support Foreign Minister Zhou's protest, and we are determined to fight to the end under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government to defend our sacred territory. If U.S. imperialism dares to extend its bloody hands to us again, we must cut them off, we must smash it to pieces!

    Annual Car Repair Task Has Been Completed Ahead of Schedule
    Determined to Work Harder to Produce and Support Korea

    Editor:
    Our Changxindian Railway Factory Passenger Car Yard's 1950 car repair task was 618.3 cars. With the concerted efforts of all the workers, we were able to complete and exceed the task every month. Now, within ten months, we have completed the annual task and exceeded the major repair task by nine cars. We believe that this is all the result of the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. Although we have made some achievements, we are by no means proud or complacent. We must continue to work hard, carry forward the "February 7th" revolutionary spirit, and further improve quality and quantity.
    Now U.S. imperialism is expanding its aggression, destroying Asian peace, occupying our Taiwan Province, bombing our Northeast and Shandong, and aggressively invading Korea, bringing the flames of war to our Northeast border. All the workers in our yard unanimously believe that the U.S. imperialists' acts of aggression can no longer be tolerated. We must not allow even one inch of our liberated free territory to be invaded by imperialism! We must not allow our liberated happy people to be oppressed and enslaved by imperialism again! We are determined to take practical actions, step up production, support Korea, completely drive U.S. imperialism out of Korea and out of the Asian continent, and resolutely fight to the end to build our prosperous, free, and happy new country!
    All staff and workers of the Changxindian Railway Factory Passenger Car Yard

    Volunteering to Go to Korea to Support the Korean People
    Join the Ranks of the Anti-Aggression War

    Editor:
    We have seen the U.S. imperialists brutally invade Korea, massacring the people of our brother country, and shamelessly undermining world peace. We can no longer tolerate their outrageous behavior, and we must resolutely defeat them. The peace-loving people of the world have infinite power and can completely shatter the U.S. imperialists' aggressive plots and completely eliminate them.
    We, the glorious youth of the Mao Zedong era, must play an active leading role in production and construction, and national defense construction. We have already organized ourselves. We must expose the ugly face, shameless behavior, and aggressive plots of the U.S. imperialists. Our iron will to defend world peace has the firm confidence to defeat and eliminate the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys. We volunteer to go to Korea to support the Korean people's great war and overthrow U.S. imperialism. We demand to join the strong ranks that are defeating U.S. imperialism and fight to defend world peace.

    If U.S. Imperialism's Bloody Claws Dare to Extend into Our Free Land
    The People's Iron Fist Will Give It a Crushing Blow

    Editor:
    The various crimes and brutal acts committed by U.S. imperialism against Korea, our brother country with flesh and blood ties, since it launched the war of aggression, have aroused the anger of peace-loving and democratic people all over the world; especially the unreasonable invasion of our sacred territory - Taiwan, and the many acts of provocation in our airspace, cannot but arouse the serious concern of every Chinese person. Recently, it has blatantly announced an attack on our Northeast border, greatly threatening our country's security. U.S. imperialism's arrogant adventurism has been severely warned by the Chinese people more than once. However, this vicious and shameless enemy, disregarding the opposition of the people all over the world, has intensified its large-scale war of aggression, dreaming of annexing Korea, occupying our Northeast, destroying all of China, and then enslaving the entire Asian people. But the Asian people, especially the Chinese people who have already stood up, will never forget the bloody historical lessons of Japanese imperialism's invasion of China, and are highly vigilant against U.S. imperialism following the old path of Japanese imperialism.
    The strength of the Chinese people is powerful, enough to resist the aggression of this beast, and beat it until it is bruised and bleeding. Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries are the best examples and role models.
    The Chinese people have achieved victory after a long and arduous struggle and have launched great construction work on the free land. We have a strong national defense force to defend world peace and protect our motherland, millions of militia forces, and especially the rapid improvement of national awareness and unprecedented unity, with 200 million people having signed the Stockholm Appeal... This is the greatest guarantee that their own motherland is sacred and inviolable. The Chinese people have been tempered in long-term battles. If U.S. imperialism's bloody claws dare to extend to this free land, the people's iron fist will give it a crushing blow.

    Volunteering to Put Down the Pen and Pick Up the Gun
    Not Afraid of War for a Better Future

    Editor:
    U.S. imperialism illegally passed the reactionary resolution to invade Korea with its voting machine, and sent troops to aggressively invade our brother country, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. We China cannot sit idly by and do nothing. U.S. imperialism has repeatedly invaded our airspace, strafed our peaceful residents, and warships are stationed in our territory, Taiwan. We can no longer tolerate it. In the past, U.S. imperialism used weapons to help Chiang Kai-shek kill our thousands of compatriots, sent special agents to sabotage our construction, and kill our people, wanting to turn our country into its colony. These crimes cannot escape.
    American bombers are destroying the homes, factories, and hospitals of the Korean people. American soldiers are carrying out the massacre of peaceful and righteous Korean people, looting wildly, acting unscrupulously in Korea under the banner of the United Nations, and attacking Korea with a large number of troops, burning the flames of war to the Chinese border.
    We know that China's heavy industry center - the Northeast - is only separated from Korea by the Yalu River. The expansion of aggression by the U.S. imperialists in Korea directly threatens our construction. The U.S. imperialists will not let us produce well in those precious factories. For a better future, we are not afraid of war. We cannot let our dear Korean brothers and sisters be killed by the U.S. imperialists again. Standing on the position of internationalism, the Korean people are being massacred by the U.S. imperialists, and their beautiful fields are being destroyed by the U.S. imperialists, we cannot stand by. We must take practical actions to support them. I want to put down my pen and pick up the gun. I volunteer to go to Korea to fight the U.S. imperialists and fight to eliminate imperialism.
    Wang Zongwu, Hebei Provincial Normal School

    We Must Take Practical Action
    And Fight Shoulder to Shoulder With the Korean People's Army!

    Editor:
    The American devils are occupying our Chinese territory of Taiwan, preventing us from liberating it. The peaceful Korean people are being slaughtered by the American devils. Our Northeast, Andong, Linjiang... and other places are being repeatedly strafed and bombed by the American devils. In recent days, they have even come to our Shandong coast to invade. Who knows where they will invade next! Are we 475 million people just going to endure this? No, never! All the members of this association really can't bear this arrogant aggression led by U.S. imperialism. Facts tell us that this endurance will not satisfy the U.S. imperialists. Therefore, we must take practical actions to fight alongside the Korean People's Army and fight desperately with the U.S. imperialists and their accomplices! All the members of this association are willing to contribute all their strength.

　　坚决抗美援朝保家卫国
    ——本报各地读者来信
    坚决镇压特务间谍分子
    支援朝鲜朝鲜保卫祖国安全编辑同志：
    美国帝国主义武装侵略台湾、朝鲜，已经激起我们最大愤慨。美帝的武装侵略遭到朝鲜人民的沉重打击以后，又施行疯狂冒险的军事赌博，越过“三八”线，向我国鸭绿江边进犯，轰炸扫射我国城市乡村，并在我国内部指使特务土匪进行造谣破坏，阴谋暗害。这就更加使我们激愤难忍。我们人民解放军公安部队，站在光荣的警卫战线上，坚决镇压美帝走狗特务间谍分子的活动。并时刻准备着，在祖国需要的时候，和美国侵略者进行决死的斗争。发扬我军英勇顽强的战斗传统和革命英雄主义精神，坚决支援朝鲜，解放台湾，为粉碎美帝扩大侵略，保卫祖国而战。
            警卫英雄贺福祥
    一旦需要武装斗争保卫祖国时
    我要和全国人民一起参加战斗编辑同志：
    我们最近在报纸上，看到侵略朝鲜的美机不断侵略祖国神圣的边疆，屠杀我们的同胞，摧毁人民的财产。今天，我们又看到了周外长致电联合国，控诉美机侵入我山东沿海肆行侦察扫射，我们非常愤怒，坚决拥护周外长向联合国的控诉。
    过去，我们在毛主席的英明领导下，为祖国的独立解放和人民的自由幸福，而流血负伤，打败日本帝国主义及美帝和美帝走狗国民党反动派，人民获得了解放。当前，美帝国主义又直接来屠杀中国人民，我们决不能容忍美帝这凶恶的侵略罪行，坚决向毛主席表示：虽然我们身体残废，但意志是坚强的，一旦需要武装斗争来保卫祖国时，我们一定和全国人民一起拿起武器，为彻底消灭美国侵略者而战斗不懈。重伤的同志，保证努力学习，提高本领，参加新中国的各种建设，站在自己的岗位上，发扬优良传统，团结广大人民为保卫祖国而贡献出一切力量！
    我们一致高呼：
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    人民领袖毛主席万岁！
    山东省荣军学校全体荣军敬上
    反对美帝扩大侵略
    保卫我们的好生活编辑同志：
    我是荣誉军人，从河北省迁到东北。出发时有干部、医生护送我们，并为我们设立了招待站。大家在路上感到很安适，怀孕的妇女也能安全地在路上分娩。
    到达目的地时，当地的县委、县长、区长、学生、各人民团体都打着锣鼓，在车站热烈欢迎。他们帮助我们扛东西，抱小孩，扶送老年人下车。第二天，各区村便派来了马车迎接我们。东北的荒地很多，土质肥沃，交通方便。当地老乡们都发挥了高度的阶级友爱，自动捐款、借粮、送柴，并给我们买了许多应用的家具。政府恐怕我们挨冻，给我们每户分配了一个热炕，帮助我们搞副业，贷给我们靰鞡上山打柴。这样便使我们很舒服地度过了寒冷的冬天。今年春天，春耕开始了，政府首先贷给每户移民吃粮、草料和锄头等。因为当时开荒困难，老乡们都自动献出熟地，使每户移民获得一垧至二垧的土地。因为我是个荣誉军人，村政府及老乡们更自动给我代耕。我今年种了三垧地，庄稼长得极好。去年来的移民，生活都已上升为中农水平。大家普遍反映：要不是毛主席，咱们早就饿死了。咱们永远也忘不了共产党和毛主席啊！
    现在移民们都已普遍改善了生活。可是美帝国主义却屡次侵犯我国的领空，杀害我们的同胞，企图使我们重陷于苦难的深渊。因此，对于美帝国主义这种无耻的罪行，我们决不能忍受。我们坚决拥护十月十日中央人民政府外交部发言人的声明，反对美帝扩大侵略战争。今后我们要努力生产，保卫我们的国土，保卫我们的好生活！
          海伦县海北镇裕民盆窑厂刘玉珊
    中朝两国人民有着血肉关系
    不能再让我们的兄弟受苦了编辑同志：
    我是北京人民印刷厂的一个青年工人。我要把我心里的话告诉你们。自从美帝发动了侵朝战争，无数朝鲜人民被杀害了。我非常痛恨美帝，又非常同情朝鲜人民。朝鲜人民曾和我们在一起并肩作战，反抗日本帝国主义并得到了胜利。他们这次在解放战争中，又勇敢地打击了用飞机轰炸我东北及阻止我代表参加安理会的敌人——美帝国主义者。中国人民与朝鲜人民是这样的血肉关系！因此我对美帝的侵略行为及朝鲜人民因此所遭受的痛苦，实在忍无可忍了。我们不能不用实际帮助去解除兄弟的痛苦。因为这样，现在我的心像火烧一样。我们是不能再等着让我们的兄弟受痛苦了。这封信上写的不但是我自己的想法，我与很多同志谈到这问题时，他们都和我的想法是一样的。同志们都说今天的中国可不是过去的中国了，不但我国不能受帝国主义的侵略，一切民主国家，我们都不能让帝国主义侵略！
    北京人民印刷厂  郭会友
    美帝如胆敢伸出血爪
    我们就一定把它斩断编辑同志：
    当我们听到美机连续侵犯我国领空的消息后，真使我们非常愤恨。
    美帝这个强盗，是一贯与中国人民为敌的。当它在援助反动派蒋介石屠杀中国人民的罪行遭到失败以后，它又公开地侵略我们邻邦——朝鲜和我国领土——台湾，现在更疯狂地扩大侵略战争，并企图将战争的火焰推向我国边境，严重地威胁着我国的安全。这种有计划地向中国人民及全世界爱好和平的人民的挑衅行为，是我们决不能忍受的。
    我们在战胜日寇的侵略和推翻蒋介石的统治中，流出了无数的鲜血。我们决不让任何帝国主义者再来夺取我们的胜利果实，我们也决不容许任何帝国主义者对我们的国土有所侵犯。我们完全拥护周外长的抗议，我们坚决在毛主席和中央人民政府的领导下，为保卫我们的神圣领土奋斗到底。如果美帝再敢向我们伸出它的血手，我们一定要将它斩断，我们一定要碰它个粉碎！
    华北兵工局兵工职业学校全体教职学员
    全年修车任务已经提前完成
    决心更加努力生产支援朝鲜编辑同志：
    我们长辛店铁路工厂客车场一九五○年的修车任务是六一八·三辆。在全体工友一致努力下，每月都能完成并超过任务。现在在十个月内已经完成了全年的任务，并超过了大修九辆。我们认为这都是毛主席与中国共产党英明领导的结果。虽然我们做出了一些成绩，但是决不骄傲，决不自满，仍要继续努力，发扬“二七”革命精神，再进一步提高质量和产量。
    现在美帝扩大侵略，破坏亚洲和平，侵占我台湾省，轰炸我东北、山东，在朝鲜大肆侵略，并把战火烧到我国东北边境。我场全体工友一致认为：美帝这种侵略行为，再也不能忍受。我们解放了的自由领土，决不能再让帝国主义侵略一寸！我们解放了的幸福人民，决不能再受帝国主义的压迫奴役！我们决以实际行动，加紧生产，支援朝鲜，彻底把美帝国主义赶出朝鲜，赶出亚洲大陆去，为建设我们富强自由幸福的新国家坚决奋斗到底！
    长辛店铁路工厂客车场全体职工
    志愿赴朝支援朝鲜人民
    参加反侵略战争的行列编辑同志：
    我们看到了美帝残暴地侵略朝鲜，屠杀着我们兄弟国家的人民，无耻地破坏世界和平，我们再也不能忍受它们这种放肆的行为，我们要坚决地打垮它。全世界爱好和平的人民有无穷的力量，完全可以粉碎美帝侵略阴谋，彻底消灭它们。
    我们，光荣的毛泽东时代的青年，我们要在生产建设、国防建设上起积极的带头作用。我们已经组织起来了。我们要暴露美帝丑恶的面孔、无耻的行为和侵略的阴谋，我们钢铁般保卫世界和平的意志，有打垮并消灭美帝及其走狗的坚强信心。我们志愿地赴朝鲜支援朝鲜人民伟大的战争，打倒美帝国主义。我们要求参加到打垮美帝的强壮的行列里，为保卫世界和平而斗争。

    美帝血爪如敢伸进我自由土地
    人民的铁拳将给以粉碎的打击编辑同志：
    美帝国主义对我们血肉相连的兄弟国家朝鲜，发动侵略战争以来，所作的种种罪恶和残暴行为，激起了全世界爱好和平民主的人民的愤怒；特别是对我神圣的国土——台湾的无理侵略，以及在我领空的多次挑衅行为，不能不引起每一个中国人民的严重关怀。近来更明目张胆地宣布向我东北边境进攻，大大地威胁着我国的安全。美帝国主义的狂妄冒险，已不止一次受到中国人民的严厉警告，然而这个凶恶而无耻的敌人，不顾全世界人民的反对，变本加厉地进行疯狂的大规模的侵略战争，梦想吞并朝鲜，侵占我东北，灭亡全中国，进而奴役整个亚洲人民。但是亚洲人民特别是已经站立起来的中国人民永远也不会忘记日本帝国主义侵略中国的血的历史教训，高度地警惕着美帝国主义走着日本帝国主义的旧路。
    中国人民的力量是强大的，她足以抵挡住这个野兽的侵略，并打它个头破血流。日本帝国主义和国民党反动派就是最好的例子和榜样。
    中国人民经过长期艰巨的斗争才取得了胜利并在自由的土地上展开了伟大的建设工作。我们有捍卫世界和平和保卫祖国的强大国防军，有数百万民兵武装，特别是全国人民觉悟的迅速提高和空前的大团结，已有两万万人民在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名……这就是自己祖国神圣不可侵犯的最大保障，中国人民是在长期的战斗中锻炼出来的，美帝国主义的血爪如果敢伸到这块自由的土地上，人民的铁拳将给它以粉碎的打击。
    国立高工李思源
    志愿放下笔杆拿起枪杆
    为了美好将来不怕战争编辑同志：
    美帝用表决机器非法通过了侵略朝鲜的反动决议，大肆出兵侵略我们兄弟国家朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，我们中国不能坐视不救。美帝一再侵我领空，扫射我国和平居民，军舰停在我们国土台湾。我们无法再容忍了。过去美帝用武器帮蒋介石杀害了我们千万同胞，派遣特务破坏我国建设，杀害我国人民，想把我国变为他的殖民地。这些罪行，决不能脱逃。
    美国的轰炸机在炸毁朝鲜人民的房屋、工厂、医院，美国兵在实行屠杀爱好和平的朝鲜正义的人们，大肆抢劫，打着联合国旗子，在朝鲜胡作非为，以大量兵力进攻朝鲜，把战争的火焰燃烧到中国边境。
    我们知道中国的重工业地中心——东北与朝鲜仅隔鸭绿江。美帝在朝鲜扩大侵略直接威胁我国建设，那里宝贵的工厂美帝是不能叫我们好好生产的。我们为了美好将来，不怕战争。我们不能叫亲爱的朝鲜兄弟姐妹们再受美帝杀害。我们站在国际主义立场，朝鲜人民受美帝屠杀，他们美丽的田园，遭美帝破坏，我们不能旁观，要以实际行动来支援他们，我要放下我的笔杆，拿起枪杆，志愿赴朝鲜与美帝作战，为消灭帝国主义而奋斗。
    河北省立师范王宗武
    我们要采取实际的行动
    与朝鲜人民军并肩作战！编辑同志：
    咱们中国的领土台湾，美国鬼子盘据着，阻止我们解放。和平的朝鲜人民被美国鬼子屠杀着。我们的东北安东、临江……等地被美国鬼子屡次地扫射、轰炸着。最近几天又竟来我山东海岸侵犯，真是说不定何时又要犯我何地！我们四万七千五百万人民就一直这样忍受下去吗？不，决不！本会全体会员实在再不能忍受这以美帝为首的横暴侵略行为。事实告诉我们这忍受是不会使美帝国主义者满足的。因此，我们要用实际行动与朝鲜人民军并肩作战，和美帝及其帮凶们拚命！本会全体会员愿贡献一切力量。
