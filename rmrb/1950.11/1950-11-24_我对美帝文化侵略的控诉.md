　　My Accusation Against American Imperialist Cultural Aggression
　　(Chen Huahuo, Student of Tsinghua University)
　　I am a student who received five years of "education" from American missionary schools, from middle school to university. It was the People's Liberation Army that liberated me from "American education." Just as workers overturned and became masters, and peasants overturned and gained land, I also overturned spiritually and gained true light and freedom. I realize that five years of American imperialist education poisoned me spiritually, and I realize the true face of American imperialist cultural aggression. I want to accuse them!
　　Like ordinary missionary schools, the middle school I attended took "improving English proficiency" as its main educational policy. Most of the teachers were American returnees, and they invariably encouraged us to learn English. In that environment, I did work hard on English, often boasting among my classmates about being able to speak a few words of English. When I entered university, many of the teachers were Americans. The importance of English was naturally beyond question. And the extracurricular books that those American teachers assigned to us were all detective novels published in the United States. At that time, I felt that these books were very much to my liking. Because these books were not only very shallow, but also full of tense, thrilling, sensual, and fighting plots. We all devoured one book after another.
　　Under such an environment and receiving such American education, my thinking became completely "Americanized": American novels were good, magazines like "Life," "Look," "Reader's Digest," and "Movie Magazine" were basic reading materials, and movies had to be American movies. When meeting with classmates, we would either talk about movies or novels like "Gone with the Wind" and "Forever Amber." At that time, I really thought "Gone with the Wind" was the only great novel of ancient and modern times, both Chinese and foreign. Its plot was so tight, the narrative was so layered, and Scarlett O'Hara was such a "unique" character, it was really amazing!
　　Before going to bed at night, I also liked to read some American comic strips. Eight or nine out of ten of those comic book covers were of a half-naked woman, but I thought they were very beautiful and sensual. So I would lie in bed and start daydreaming.
　　I loved to watch such decadent and anesthetizing American cultural "influences," and my whole outlook on life was uninspired, passive, and dreamy. All day long I was babbling in my dreams. I was single-mindedly thinking of studying in the United States, and after returning, I could become a high-ranking official or make a lot of money, buy a Western-style house, buy a car, and ride high above others.
　　After liberation, the American imperialists were driven out of mainland China, and American books and magazines gradually decreased in the market. But the poison that American "culture" had given me in the past was still quite deeply rooted in my mind. Fortunately, I began to have the opportunity to access some new books. I spent a long time reading "A Short History of Social Development," and thus had a preliminary understanding of the essence of American imperialist economic aggression, but I was still quite fond of the so-called American culture. Later, I borrowed a copy of "How the Steel Was Tempered" from a friend's house. This book caused a great change in my thinking. The protagonist, Pavel Korchagin, was so new to me, but also seemed so strange. I began to think: why is the hero in this book completely different from the heroes in American books before? Why does Pavel have a spirit of hard work and reckless hard work? He has been working for so long, why hasn't he been promoted or made a fortune? Pavel's selfless spirit slowly aroused my sympathy. I asked myself: what is he working so selflessly for? Can a person really dedicate his whole life to a belief, an ideal? Slowly, I came to the conclusion: Pavel Korchagin is not only a great hero, but also a real person - a person with flesh and blood and a noble soul. Such a character not only opened the way to the light for me, but also made me fundamentally question American "culture." I thought: what did American novels give me? Take "Gone with the Wind," which I used to like the most, for example. It wants us to believe that the Ku Klux Klan is a revolutionary organization, it wants us to believe that the Southern landlords' resistance to the liberation of black slaves is a "revolutionary act"; the author writes about the "benevolence" of the landlords in great detail, and tries to prove that the "happiness" of the Southern landlord class was destroyed by the "Yankees." The author almost wants to deny that the black slave system is unreasonable. The hero Scarlett O'Hara that we admired is just an "individual hero." The plot is just a ridiculous love story. The only thing that "Gone with the Wind" brought to me at that time was the recollection and fantasy of the luxurious life of the Southern landlords, and nothing else.
　　After such a comparison, the poison of American imperialist culture began to show its true colors. After I transferred to a new and progressive environment, everything I came into contact with was basically healthy and progressive, and I read more new books, I deepened my understanding of American imperialist culture. I read "Stories of the 25,000-Li Long March," which moved me to tears, and at the same time made me feel very ashamed. Over the years, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation have been fighting heroically in such a difficult environment, while I have been confused and muddled through half my life under the cultural aggression of American imperialism. I also read books such as "Public Enemy Chiang Kai-shek" and "The Long March," and I also read novels such as "Changes in Li Village," "On the Sanggan River," and "Plateau Short Song," and I also watched movies such as "The Fall of Berlin," "The Young Guard," and "They Have a Motherland." They made me clearly see a new world, and made my outlook on life change from passive to active, from a "fin de siècle" mood to an early century mood. Since the movement to resist America and aid Korea began, I have strengthened my research on American imperialist aggression. I realize that American imperialist aggression has always been economic, military, political, and cultural. Those churches and schools are all tools for American imperialists to carry out cultural aggression against me. They did not bring knives, nor did they bring guns, but they brought anesthetics that were more poisonous than knives and guns. But China has been liberated, the people have stood up, and intellectuals can no longer eat the anesthetics of American imperialism. Now is the time for American imperialist anesthetic culture to get out of China completely.

### 我对美帝文化侵略的控诉

　　我对美帝文化侵略的控诉
    （清华大学学生陈华火）
    我是一个从中学以至大学一共受了五年美国教会学校“教育”的学生。解放军来了，才把我从“美国教育”里解放出来。正如工人翻身当了主人，农民翻身得了土地，我也从精神上翻身，获得真正的光明和自由。我认识到五年美帝教育给了我精神上的毒害，我认识到美帝文化侵略的真面目。我要控诉！
    和一般的教会学校一样，我念书的那个中学是以“提高英文程度”为其主要教育方针。一般教员多半是美国留学生，他们无例外地鼓励我们学英文。在那种环境里，我也确实在英文上下了一番苦功，常常以能说三两句英语而夸耀于同学之间。进了大学，教员很多是美国人。英文的重视自然不在话下。而那些美国教员指定给我们阅读的课外书籍，尽是些美国出版的侦探小说，我那时候觉得这些书是很合口味的。因为这些书既很浅，又充满了紧张、惊险、香艳、打斗的情节。我们都是手不释卷的看了一本又一本。
    在这样的环境下受着这样的美国教育的我，思想上也就全部“美国化”了：小说是美国的好，杂志以《生活》、《明镜》、《读者文摘》、《电影杂志》等为基本读物，电影也就非美国片不行的了。与同学碰头的时候，不是谈谈电影，就是谈谈《飘》、《琥魄》之类的小说。那时候，我真的觉得《飘》是古今中外的唯一伟大小说。它的情节是这么的紧凑，叙事又这么有层次，思嘉又是一个这么有“个性”的人物，真是了不起！
    晚上临睡的时候，我还喜欢看些美国连环图。那些连环画的封面十之八九都是一个半裸的女人，但我却觉得很美，很肉感。于是睡在床上也就胡思乱想起来。
    我爱看这样颓废、麻醉的美国文化的“薰陶”，我的整个人生观是不振作的，消极的、梦幻的。整天到晚都在发梦呓。一心想到美国去留学，回来后就可以做大官或者赚大钱，买座洋楼，买部汽车，高高地骑在他人之上。
    解放之后，美帝被赶出了中国大陆，市场上美国书籍杂志都慢慢地减少了。可是过去美国“文化”给予我的毒素还是相当深地留在我的头脑里。幸得我开始有机会接触一些新书。我费了很久的时间看完了《社会发展史讲义》，因而对美帝的经济侵略本质有了初步的认识，但对于美国的所谓文化，还是相当的留恋。后来在一个朋友家里借到了一本《钢铁是怎样炼成的》。这本书使我的思想发生了很大的变化。主人公保尔·柯察金对我是这么的新鲜，但又显得这么的陌生。我开始想了：为什么这本书的英雄与从前美国书里的英雄完全不同呢？为什么保尔有着苦干、蛮干的精神呢？他干了这么久，为什么还没有升官发财？保尔的忘我精神慢慢地激发了我的同情心。我问自己：他这样忘我地工作，到底为了些什么？一个人是不是真的可以为了一个信仰、一个理想而把整个生命贡献出去？慢慢地，我获得了结论：保尔·柯察金不单是一个伟大的英雄人物，而且是一个真正的人——一个有血有肉而且有崇高灵魂的人。这样的人物不但为我打开了走向光明之路，同时也使我对美国“文化”发生了根本的怀疑。我想：美国的小说给了我些什么呢？就以我从前最喜欢的《飘》来说罢，它要我们相信三Ｋ党是一个革命的组织，它要我们相信南方地主反抗解放黑奴是“革命的行为”；作者把地主的“仁慈”写得淋漓尽致，并力求证明南方地主阶级的“幸福”是被“北佬”破坏了的。作者几乎想否认黑奴制度是不合理的。我们所崇拜的英雄人物郝思嘉，不过是一个“个人英雄主义”者。情节只是可笑的恋爱故事。《飘》这本书当时给我带来的只是对南方地主的豪华生活的追忆和幻想，此外什么也没有了。
    经过了这样的比较，美帝的文化的毒素开始现形了。等到我转到了一个新的进步的环境之后，接触的一切都是基本上健康的和进步的，新的书看得更多，我更加深了对美帝文化的体会。我看了《二万五千里长征故事》，它使我感动得流下泪来，同时也使我觉得非常惭愧。这些年来，中华民族的优秀儿女是在这样艰苦的环境里英勇地斗争着，而我却在美帝的文化侵略下糊糊涂涂地混了半生。我又看了《人民公敌蒋介石》、《二万五千里长征》等书，我也看了《李家庄的变迁》、《桑乾河上》、《高原短曲》等小说，我也看了《攻克柏林》、《青年近卫军》、《他们有祖国》等电影。它们使我清楚地看到一个新世界，使我的人生观从消极变到积极，从“世纪末”的心情带到世纪初的心情。自抗美援朝的运动展开以来，我加强了对美帝侵略的研究。我认清楚美帝的侵略本来就是经济、军事、政治、文化并进的。那些教会、学校，都是美帝对我进行文化侵略的工具，他们都没有带刀，也没有带枪，但却带了比刀枪更毒的麻醉药。但是中国已经解放了，人民已经站起来了，知识分子可以不再吃美帝的麻醉剂了。现在应该是美帝的麻醉性文化从中国彻底滚蛋的时候了。
