    "The Outsider"
    This film records the story of the famous Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic botanist Dr. Minas, which was caused by "transcendental" thinking. He arranged for himself to live a secluded life, not asking about politics; therefore, he summoned his eldest son—a special agent sent by the German devils to lurk in secret. After the lessons of various facts, this botanist, Dr. Minas, came to believe that only the Soviet system could give life to science and corrected his past "transcendental" idea of science for science's sake. He then realized his ideal of turning swamps into fertile fields.
    Through this vivid and true film, it is of great educational significance to some of our Chinese intellectuals who still harbor some "transcendental" thoughts. It profoundly criticizes this kind of "transcendental" thought—ultra-political, science for science's sake, and even art for art's sake, and so on. Because this kind of thinking will actually make him an accomplice of the reactionaries.
    Today, those who still have more or less illusions about American imperialism, after watching the movie "The Outsider," cannot help but gain profound enlightenment and valuable lessons from the experience of Dr. Minas.

    “世外人”
    这部影片是记载爱沙尼亚苏维埃社会主义共和国著名的植物学家米纳斯博士由于“超然”思想所引起的故事。他安排自己度着隐居的生活，不问政治；因而召来了他的长子——一个德国鬼子派来的特务阴谋潜伏，经过种种事实的教训之后，这位植物学家米纳斯博士才相信了只有苏维埃制度能够赋予科学的生命，纠正了过去为科学而科学的“超然”想法，他才实现了使沼泽变为良田的理想。
    通过这部生动的、真实的影片，对我们中国某些还多少拖有些“超然”思想的知识分子是有很大教育意义的，它深刻批判了这种“超然”思想——超政治，为科学而科学，以至为艺术而艺术等等思想。因为这种思想在实际上就会给他做了反动派的帮凶。
    在今天凡是对美帝还存在或多或少幻想的人，看过“世外人”影片，不能不从米纳斯博士的经历中得到深刻的启发和可贵的经验教训。
