Learning from Soviet Art
Striving to Defend Peace
Cao Yu

At a time when human civilization is being severely threatened by the aggressive wars of the American imperialists, and the people of the world and the Chinese people are united like steel around the mighty Soviet peace fortress, the Chinese people and literary and art workers are welcoming the great Soviet October Revolution Day with boundless excitement and gratitude.

For more than twenty years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, Chinese literary and art workers, on the one hand, have resisted the Kuomintang's secret agents, bayonets, and prisons, engaging in life-and-death struggles against imperialism and feudalism, and on the other hand, have sincerely and humbly learned from the people, faithfully reflecting their lives, thoughts, and demands. It is precisely because they have followed the glorious example of Soviet literary and art workers after the October Revolution. Outstanding Chinese writers and artists have consistently focused on a sincere desire to learn, studying the advanced cultural experience of the Soviet Union, and striving to explore a correct creative method adapted to the tasks of the Chinese revolution and the needs of the Chinese masses. Relying on the heroic strength of the Chinese people and the enormous assistance of the Soviet Union, China has victoriously liberated itself. In the fertile soil of the new Chinese national art and literature, we have already begun to see the "bright and iron-like new flowers" that Lu Xun eagerly hoped for eighteen years ago. This achievement has a very deep and close relationship with the enthusiastic help of Soviet cultural workers after the October Revolution.

Therefore, the artistic creation methods and theories of New Realism have long been widely absorbed by Chinese revolutionary literary and art workers as the basic direction of their creation. The brilliant treatises of Lenin and Stalin on culture and art, and Zhdanov's instructions on music, drama, and film, have become documents for our continuous study. The profound and correct literary and artistic theories and criticisms of Belinsky, Gorky, Fadeyev, Simonov, and other Soviet writers are often articles for our classrooms, symposiums, creative research classes, and discussions and studies by literary and art workers in factories and troops. We are constantly paying attention to the criticisms and reports published in Pravda, Literary Gazette, and Art Gazette. Recently, Stalin's important documents on linguistics have become a subject of our enthusiastic study.

Therefore, as early as the May Fourth Movement in 1919, China's most outstanding cultural warriors, Lu Xun, Qu Qiubai, Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, and countless literary and artistic pioneers, first introduced Soviet poetry, novels, woodcuts, and literary and artistic theories. The scope and scale of this introduction work has been increasing day by day. This year alone, the translations of Russian classical literature and Soviet works published in China have exceeded 315 types. These works have not only sharpened our ideological weapons and become one of the important nutrients for our literary and artistic workers, but also educated the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the working people, helping to strengthen their class consciousness and fighting enthusiasm.

Therefore, when the delegation of Soviet cultural workers toured Shenyang, Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, and other major cities in China a year ago, the Chinese people and Chinese literary and art workers welcomed, loved, and admired these representatives of the highest human loyalty, friendship, and wisdom with indescribable enthusiasm. The 640,000 Chinese people who came into contact with them expressed unanimous praise and gratitude: "These are better friends than flesh and blood"; the hundreds of millions of Chinese listeners who heard their broadcasts gained a unanimous and indelible impression: "This is the great voice of communism, representing the world's most sublime ideals and goals." They are our most familiar and respected writers and artists. In just one month, their enthusiasm, sincerity, and tireless work, penetrating into factories, villages, troops, and schools, further promoted the traditional friendship between the Soviet Union and the Chinese people, and further strengthened the Chinese people's fighting will to defend world peace.

We should especially point out the most meaningful enlightenment that the head of the delegation, Fadeyev, and the deputy head of the delegation, Simonov, and other outstanding artists gave to major issues in Chinese literature and art. They used the advanced experience of the Soviet Union to answer our questions about socialist realism, Soviet literature, drama, music, film, and art, as well as Soviet cultural construction. Their emphasis on China's cultural heritage also gave us a deep impression. The art troupe and the Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble that came with the delegation also left a broad impact on the artistic work of the new China. In the past year, the dances in the Chinese troops have made further progress, which is obviously due to the education of the Red Army Song and Dance Ensemble's lively, cheerful, and heroic performances.

Half a year later, the Soviet youth delegation led by Mikhailov visited China. They also powerfully conveyed to the Chinese youth the spirit of internationalism and the heroic spirit of fighting for the construction of the motherland and for world peace. Those deeply cultivated young dancers, musicians, and singers gave the new generation of China unlimited encouragement, making them more aware of how socialist Soviet Union attaches importance to cultivating the fighting spirit and artistic education of young people.

On the side of the People's China, the Chinese delegation to the World Peace Congress, led by Guo Moruo, had extremely close and extensive contact with the Soviet people and Soviet cultural workers in Moscow and Leningrad, including outstanding literary and artistic workers from all parts of China, Ding Ling, Xiao San, Tian Han, Hong Shen, Zheng Zhenduo, Cao Jinghua, Xu Beihong, Xu Guangping, Cheng Yanqiu, Gu Yuan, Dai Ailian, etc. Following them to the Soviet Union was the Chinese youth delegation led by General Xiao Hua to participate in the World Youth Festival, including young literary and artistic workers with remarkable achievements, He Jingzhi, Ruan Zhangjing, Sun Wei Shi, etc., as well as the dramatist Li Bozhao, and the Chinese youth foreign art work troupe led by Zhou Weizhi and Wu Xue, etc. The troupe gave many performances in Moscow and was warmly welcomed by the Soviet people. Five months later, there was also the Chinese delegation led by Ding Ling to participate in the Soviet October Revolution ceremony, including the historian Wu Han, the scientist and dramatist Ding Xilin, the art educator Shakov, the novelist Zhao Shuli, the musician Ma Sicong, etc. They were all warmly received by the Soviet people and visited the socialist construction of the Soviet Union. After returning to China, the literary and artistic representatives of the four groups, filled with important insights into Soviet cultural construction, successively wrote many reportage literature with important influence, allowing the Chinese people to have a deeper understanding of the culture of the great working people of the Soviet Union.

Along with various China-Soviet cultural exchange work groups, Chinese writers satisfied their long-standing desire to visit the Soviet Union and meet their admired and longed-for good teachers and helpful friends - outstanding Soviet writers and artists. In addition to Ding Ling, who wrote "The Sun Shines over the Sangkan River," and Zhao Shuli, who wrote "Changes in Li Village," etc., Zhou Libo, who wrote "The Hurricane," and Liu Baiyu, who is famous for writing about the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army, also had such opportunities. After reading their many reports on the Soviet Union, the Chinese people and literary and artistic workers realized even more that every Soviet person is a conscious and active builder of socialist culture, and that Soviet literature and art are the most brilliant achievements with lofty political content. Ding Ling's "Soviet People," "My Impression of Simonov," and "The Encouragement from the Editorial Department of the Banner Magazine"; Liu Baiyu's "The Author of 'A Real Man,' Polevoy," "The Author of 'Days and Nights,' Simonov," and many writers' visits such as Ehrenburg; Zhao Shuli's and Zhou Libo's reports on Soviet literature and life - these articles have helped us to further understand Soviet literature and art and have an important role in promoting the creation of new Chinese literature and art.

The exchange of culture between the two major nations of China and the Soviet Union in the past year has further developed our heartfelt and cherished unbreakable friendship.

The liberated Chinese people are becoming more and more fond of Soviet films with correct ideological content and high artistic standards. From January to June this year, 427 Soviet films were shown in large and small cities in China, with an audience of 1.44 million. This does not include the 18 most popular Soviet films with Chinese dialogue, which have had more than 3 million viewers in one year. These great films, such as "The Battle of Stalingrad," "The Meeting on the Elbe," "The Russian Question," "The Steel Will," "The Great Turning Point," "An Ordinary Soldier," and "The Young Guards," have given the Chinese People's Liberation Army, working people, and young students profound and unparalleled education. As a major symbol of the close cooperation between the artistic workers of China and the Soviet Union, the famous director Varlamov's masterpiece "The Victory of the Chinese People" was staged with unprecedented grandeur (2.5 million viewers in ten days) in 15 major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Dihua, Harbin, and Shenyang. This film aroused enthusiastic praise and attention; schools, institutions, troops, and factory clubs, like every time they watched a Soviet film, held discussions with great excitement and seriousness. In this great film, the Chinese people deeply realized the Soviet friendly country and the Soviet artists' love and concern for the great victory of the People's China; therefore, the outstanding film director Gerasimov's "Liberated China" is being looked forward to with the same enthusiasm and gratitude for its screening and greater success.

Soviet dramas are also frequently performed in China. In Shanghai and Beijing alone, the performances of "Moscow Character," "The Russian Question," "The Voice of America," and "Paul Kochakin" have attracted a large number of progressive audiences. Workers, peasants, soldiers, cadres, women, youth, and intellectuals have flocked to the theaters to learn the profound ideological content expressed in these plays. We performed "The Russian Question" and "The Voice of America" in the peace signature movement to help the audience understand the true face of American imperialism. The performance of "Paul Kochakin" produced a huge ideological and educational effect, and further helped the Chinese people understand the optimistic spirit and selfless heroism of Soviet youth in their struggle for the cause of the people.

Beautiful Soviet music and Soviet songs have been widely introduced to China. We can hear the magnificent voices singing "The March of Democratic Youth," "The March of Youth of the Motherland," and "The Song of the Youth League" in factories, villages, troops, and schools throughout China. The bright and cheerful music of the Soviet working people, filled with patriotism and internationalism, has also become loved by the Chinese people.

The Chinese people are deeply aware that the deep-rooted traditional friendship between China and the Soviet Union is a strong guarantee of world peace. In the past year, Chinese writers and artists have been even more excited and striving to convey the increasingly consolidated and developing Sino-Soviet friendship and unity. They have all created music, poems, paintings, dramas, novels, essays, and reports with high spirits and joy, describing the various assistance that the great Soviet Union has given to the Chinese people.

The poets first sang loud songs, spreading the Chinese people's love for the leader of the world's humanity when celebrating the 70th birthday of Marshal Stalin. Guo Moruo, the leader of Chinese literature and art, wrote magnificent poems to praise this world giant. Xiao San, Ai Qing, Tian Jian, Ma Fanto, and countless working people in factories and villages, unanimously expressed enthusiastic praise. I have read 115 of these famous poets' creations. Newspapers and magazines across the country have special issues praising Stalin; in people's entertainment venues everywhere, folk artists are happily singing songs and ballads praising Stalin. In this unprecedented celebration, the Chinese people unanimously expressed their heartfelt gratitude to Marshal Stalin for protecting the working people of the world and supporting the cause of human liberation.

There have been too many exciting things this year. Chairman Mao's meeting with Marshal Stalin, the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Soviet experts assisting us in construction, and the visit of the Soviet delegation have all become the content of our Chinese literary and artistic workers' creations.

Wang Shikuo and others' large-scale oil painting "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship and Cooperation" depicts the moment that the Chinese people will never forget: our wise leader Chairman Mao meeting with the leader of the world's humanity, Stalin, in Moscow. Cartoons, woodcuts, paintings, and window decorations with titles such as "The Power of the Sino-Soviet Alliance," "For Lasting Peace, For Democratic Construction," and "Let the Enemy Tremble Before the People of China and the Soviet Union" are largely published in newspapers and magazines and hung in the homes of workers and peasants throughout the country. In order to thank Soviet experts for their great help in our production and construction, Chinese workers and literary and artistic workers have written thousands of short poems, reports, dramas, songs, and quick boards, enthusiastically praising their great achievements. Under the enthusiastic education of Soviet experts, the first batch of female drivers and female tractor drivers appeared, and their representatives, Tian Guiying and Liang Jun, have become the object of praise in recent poems and novels by many writers.

China's peace signature has recently exceeded 200 million signatures. In order to cooperate with this great movement, the Central Academy of Drama performed the dance drama "Peace Dove" written by Ouyang Yuqian, which was immediately warmly welcomed by the people of the capital. Similarly, Chinese cartoonists, woodcutters, oil painters, and propaganda painters have made great efforts to defend peace. The famous cartoonist Gu Yuan drew "No War Provoker is Allowed to Destroy Our Peaceful Life Again," and other artists used these titles "Signing a Name is Equal to a Bullet," "I Want Peace, I Want to Sign," and creations with the content of opposing the US imperialist aggression against Taiwan, Korea, and other crimes, totaling 479 pieces. These soul-stirring creations have incited the Chinese people's generations of hatred for US imperialism, raised the people's political awareness, and strengthened our efforts to defend world peace.

Chinese musicians have always been at the forefront of the people's liberation struggles along with other literary and artistic workers. Deep Sino-Soviet friendship and the determination to defend the motherland and world peace have enabled them to write more than 200 songs with such political content as the theme in one year. Famous composers Ma Sicong, He Luting, Ma Ke, Zhang Lu, etc., some adopted folk forms, some used bright and cheerful melodies, and all wrote passionate creations.

For a hundred years, the cruel oppression and wars of imperialism and feudalism colluding together have made the Chinese people determined to defend the happy life of the new China that they have obtained after untold hardships. The brutal and unreasonable aggression of US imperialism against Taiwan and Korea, extending the flames of war to our borders, endangering the safety of our country and people, and hindering our peaceful construction, is absolutely intolerable. Premier Zhou Enlai said our unanimous and firm will: "The Chinese people love peace, but in order to defend peace, they have never been and will never be afraid of anti-aggression wars." Therefore, once US imperialism provokes a war of aggression, the Chinese people will use all their strength, including the power exerted by literature and art, to completely eliminate US imperialism and its accomplices. Therefore, in order to make the art weapon of defending peace sharper, Chinese literary and artistic workers sincerely look forward to the Soviet cultural workers teaching us more deeply how to effectively combine all literary and artistic forms with lofty political emotions to educate our broad masses of people, thereby further improving their courageous fighting qualities.

On the festival of the great Soviet October Revolution, Chinese literary and artistic workers celebrate the brilliant achievements of Soviet peace construction with incomparable joy and gratitude. The powerful and invincible Soviet Union is the bulwark of lasting world peace and democracy. It defends the cultural construction of the working people and creates unprecedented happiness and light for mankind. Chinese literary and artistic workers will unite more closely with Soviet cultural workers, and unite with all progressive cultural workers in the world, to defend our great motherland and the permanent happiness of mankind.

　　向苏联艺术学习
    为保卫和平奋斗
    曹禺
    当着人类的文明正受着美帝国主义者侵略战争的严重威胁，全世界人民和中国人民钢铁一般地团结在强大的苏联和平堡垒的周围的时候，中国人民和文艺工作者们是以无限兴奋与感激来迎接伟大的胜利的苏联十月革命节。
    二十几年来，在中国共产党与毛主席领导之下，中国文艺工作者一面对抗着国民党的特务、刺刀和监狱，对帝国主义、封建主义作出生入死的斗争，一面诚恳虚心地向人民学习，忠实反映人民的生活，思想和要求，正是因为他们追随了十月革命以后苏联文艺工作者的光辉榜样。优秀的中国作家与艺术家们一直贯注着一种诚恳的学习愿望，学习苏联的先进文化经验，努力探索着一种适应于中国革命任务和中国群众需要的正确的创作方法。依赖英勇的中国人民力量和苏联的巨大帮助，中国胜利地解放了。在新中国民族文艺肥沃的土壤里，我们已开始看见鲁迅在十八年前所殷切企望的“鲜艳而铁一般的新花。”这成就和十月革命以后苏联文化工作者的热忱帮助有极深厚而密切的关系。
    所以，新现实主义的艺术创作方法和理论早已广泛地被中国的革命文艺工作者吸取为创作的基本方向，列宁斯大林关于文化艺术的辉煌的论著，日丹诺夫关于音乐、戏剧、电影的指示，已成为我们不断学习的文件；伯林斯基、高尔基、法捷耶夫、西蒙诺夫和其他苏联文学家们的深刻正确的文艺理论与批评，经常是我们教室，座谈会，创作研究班以及工厂，部队文艺工作者讨论及钻研的文章。我们时时刻刻注意着刊登在真理报、文学报、艺术报的批评与报告。最近斯大林的关于语言学的重大的文献更是我们热烈学习的课题。
    所以，远自一九一九年五四运动起，中国最杰出的文化战士鲁迅、瞿秋白、郭沫若、茅盾和无数文艺先驱便首先介绍苏联的诗歌、小说、木刻的作品与文学艺术的理论。这种介绍工作的范围与规模日趋扩大，到了今年，这一年的工夫，在中国出版的俄国古典文学及苏联作品的翻译，便在三百一十五种以上。这些作品不但锋利了我们的思想武器，成为我们文艺工作者重要的养料之一，并且教育了中国人民解放军及劳动人民，帮助加强了他们的阶级觉悟和战斗热情。
    所以，当一年前苏联文化工作者代表团巡回访问沈阳、天津、北京、上海及中国其他大城市的时候，中国人民和中国文艺工作者，以无法形容的热烈，欢迎，爱戴这些代表人类最高的忠诚，友爱与智慧的人们。与他们接触过的六十四万中国人民发生一致的赞扬与感谢：“这是胜于骨肉的好朋友”；听到他们广播的亿万中国听众，获得一致的不可磨灭的亲切印象：“这是代表世界最崇高的理想和目标的共产主义的伟大声音。”他们是我们最熟悉，最敬爱的文学家与艺术家，在短短的一个月的工夫，他们的热烈真挚与不分昼夜的辛苦工作，深入工厂，农村，部队及学校，更发扬了苏联与中国人民的传统友谊，更进一步加强了中国人民保卫世界和平的战斗意志。
    我们应该特别提出，团长法捷耶夫和副团长西蒙诺夫，和其他的优秀的艺术家们对中国文学艺术上的重大问题的最有意义的启示。他们以苏联的先进经验深入浅出地替我们解答了社会主义现实主义的问题，苏联的文学、戏剧、音乐、电影、美术的诸般问题，以及苏联文化建设问题。他们对于中国文化遗产的重视也给了我们深刻的印象。与代表团同来的艺术队和红军歌舞团更在新中国的艺术工作上留下了广大的影响。近一年来，中国部队上的舞蹈有进一步的发展，显然是因为受了红军歌舞团活泼愉快、充溢了英雄气概的表演的教育。
    半年以后，以米哈依洛夫为首的苏联青年代表团访问中国，他们对于中国青年同样有力地传达了国际主义的，与为祖国建设，为世界和平而斗争的英勇精神。那些有深刻修养的青年舞蹈家、音乐家、歌唱家给中国新生的一代以无限的鼓舞，使他们更认识了社会主义的苏联如何重视培养青年的战斗气质和艺术教育。
    来自人民中国的这一面，以郭沫若为首的世界和平大会中国代表团，去年在莫斯科与列宁格勒和苏联人民与苏联的文化工作者有极亲密的广泛接触，其中包括中国各方优秀的文学艺术工作者，丁玲、萧三、田汉、洪深、郑振铎、曹靖华、徐悲鸿、许广平、程砚秋、古元、戴爱莲等。紧接着他们到苏联的，有以萧华将军为首的参加世界青年节大会的中国青年代表团，其中有具有显著成绩的青年文艺工作者贺敬之、阮章竞、孙惟世等，同去的还有戏剧家李伯钊，及周巍峙、吴雪等带领的中国青年出国文艺工作团。该团在莫斯科作了多次演出，获得苏联人民热忱欢迎。五个月以后，又有丁玲率领的参加苏联十月革命典礼中国代表团，其中有历史家吴晗，科学家和戏剧家丁西林，艺术教育家沙可夫，小说家赵树理，音乐家马思聪等。他们都受着苏联人民热烈的款待，参观了苏联的社会主义建设。回国以后，四个团体的文学艺术代表，载满了对于苏联文化建设的重要认识，陆续不断地写出许多有重要影响的报导文学，使中国人民，对于苏联伟大的劳动人民文化，有更深切了解。
    随着各种中苏文化交流的工作团体，中国作家满足了他们一向的愿望，访问苏联，会见他们所钦佩向往的良师益友——杰出的苏联作家和艺术家。除了上述的写《桑乾河上》的丁玲，写《李家庄的变迁》的赵树理……等之外，获得这样机会的还有写《暴风骤雨》的周立波，和以写英勇的中国人民解放军著名的刘白羽。读了他们极多的关于苏联的报告，中国人民和文艺工作者更认识到每个苏维埃人是社会主义文化的自觉的积极的建设者，苏联的文学艺术是具有崇高政治内容的最灿烂的成就。丁玲写的《苏维埃人》，《西蒙诺夫给我的印象》及《旗帜杂志编辑部给我的鼓励》；刘白羽写的《＜真正的人＞的作者波列伏依》，《＜日日夜夜＞作者西蒙诺夫》及爱伦堡等许多作家的访问记；赵树理和周立波写的关于苏联文学和生活的报导——这些文章都有助于我们对苏联文学艺术的更进一步的认识。对新中国文学艺术的创造有重要的推动作用。
    这一年来中苏两大民族文化的交流，更发展了我们衷心珍贵的牢不可破的友谊。
    解放了的中国人民，一天比一天热爱着具有正确的思想内容和高度艺术水准的苏联电影。由今年的一月到六月，在中国大小城市中放映了四百二十七种苏联影片，观众已达一百四十四万之多。这还没有计入十八部最受拥护的华语对白的苏联影片，这类影片的观众在一年的工夫又有三百多万人。这些伟大的影片如《斯大林格勒战场》、《易比河会师》、《俄罗斯问题》、《钢铁意志》、《大转变》、《普通一兵》、和《青年近卫军》等都给予中国人民解放军，劳动人民与青年学生深刻无比的教育。作为中苏两国的艺术工作者亲密合作的重大标志，著名的导演瓦尔拉莫夫的杰作《中国人民的胜利》以空前的盛况（十天的观众有二百五十万人）在北京、天津、上海、广州、重庆、迪化、哈尔滨、沈阳等十五个大城市中上演。这部影片引起热烈的赞扬和重视；学校、机关、部队以及工厂俱乐部，象每次看过苏联影片一样，都极兴奋而严肃的开着讨论会。在这伟大的影片中，中国人民深深体会到苏联友邦和苏联艺术家们对人民中国的巨大胜利的热爱与关注；因此杰出的电影导演格拉西莫夫的《解放了的中国》正被我们以同样热诚与感谢的心情期待着它的映演与更大的成功。
    苏联的戏剧也经常在中国演出了。单就上海、北京两地而言，《莫斯科性格》，《俄罗斯问题》，《美国之音》，《保尔柯察金》的演出，已拥有大量进步的观众。工人、农民、战士、干部、妇女、青年和知识分子都涌汇在戏院里，学习这些戏本所表现的深刻的思想内容。我们在和平签名运动中演出了《俄罗斯问题》与《美国之音》，帮助观众认识美帝国主义的真面目。《保尔柯察金》的演出，产生了巨大的思想教育的效果，更帮助了中国人民认识苏联青年为人民事业奋斗的乐观精神和忘我的英雄主义。
    优美的苏联音乐和苏联歌曲已普遍的被介绍到中国来，我们随时可以听到宏壮的声音高唱着《民主青年进行曲》，《祖国青年进行曲》，《青年团之歌》等，在中国广大国土上的工厂、农村。部队和学校。苏联劳动人民所喜爱的明朗快乐充溢着爱国精神与国际主义的音乐，也成为中国人民所喜爱的。
    中国人民都深切地认识到有深厚传统的中苏友谊是世界和平的有力保证。这一年来，中国的作家、艺术家更以无比的兴奋努力传达日趋巩固与发展着的中苏友好与团结。他们都以昂扬愉快的心情作出音乐、诗歌、图画、戏剧、小说、散文与报告，描写伟大苏联给予中国人民的种种帮助。
    诗人们首先唱出嘹亮的歌声，在庆祝斯大林大元帅七十寿辰的时候，传播出中国人民对世界人类领袖的热爱。中国文艺的领导者郭沫若写出壮丽的诗篇来歌颂这世界巨人。我们人民优秀的歌手，萧三、艾青、田间、马凡陀和无数工厂、农村的劳动人民一致发出热烈的赞颂。这些著名诗人的创作，我所读到的就有一百一十五首。全国各地报纸杂志都有歌颂斯大林的专刊；在各地的人民游艺场所，民间艺人们都欢欣地唱着赞颂斯大林的歌曲和鼓词。在这空前盛大的庆祝中，中国人民一致表现对斯大林大元帅爱护世界劳动人民、支持人类解放事业的衷心感激。
    这一年使我们兴奋的事情太多了，毛主席会晤斯大林大元帅，中苏缔结友好条约，苏联专家协助我们建设，和苏联代表团的访问等等，都成了我们中国文学艺术工作者的创作的内容。
    王式廓等的巨幅油画《中苏友好合作万岁》描绘出中国人民永世不能忘记的刹那：我们英明的领袖毛主席与世界人类的领袖斯大林在莫斯科的会见。以《中苏盟约的威力》，《为了持久和平，为了民主建设》，《让敌人在中苏两国人民的面前发抖吧》等题目作成的漫画、木刻、绘画、窗花大量地刊登在报纸与杂志上，悬挂在全国各地工人农民的家庭里。为了感谢苏联专家对于我们生产建设的巨大帮助，中国的工人和文艺工作者写成了成千篇的短诗、报告、戏剧、歌曲、快板，热烈地赞扬他们重大的劳绩。在苏联专家热心教育之下，第一批女司机与女拖拉机手出现了，她们的胜利代表者田桂英和梁军成为最近许多作家的诗歌、小说的表扬对象。
    中国的和平签名，最近已有两亿人以上的签名。中央戏剧学院为了配合这伟大的运动，演出了欧阳予倩编写的舞剧《和平鸽》，它立刻便为首都人民热烈地欢迎。同样，中国的漫画、木刻、油画、宣传画的工作者以保卫和平为内容尽了很大的努力。著名的漫画家古元画了“不允许任何战争挑寡者再来破坏我们的和平生活”，其他的美术家用这些题目《签一个名等于一颗子弹》，《我要和平，我要签名》，和以反对美帝侵略台湾、朝鲜及其它罪行为内容的创作共有四百七十九幅。这些动人心魄的创作煽动了中国人民对美帝国主义世世代代的仇恨，提高人民的政治觉悟，加强了我们保卫世界和平的努力。
    中国的音乐工作者一直和其他文艺工作者一道，站在人民解放各种斗争的前列。深厚的中苏友谊和保卫祖国与世界和平的决心使他们在一年内写出以这样的政治内容为主题的歌曲便有二百余首。著名的作曲家马思聪、贺禄汀、马可、张鲁等，有的采取民间形式，有的运用明朗愉快的旋律，都写出热情饱满的创作。
    百年来，帝国主义和封建主义勾结起来的残酷压迫和战争，使中国人民决心保卫他们经过千辛万苦才获得的新中国的幸福生活。美帝国主义凶暴无理的侵略台湾，朝鲜，把战争的火焰延烧到我们的边境，危害我们国家人民的安全，阻挠了我们的和平建设，这是断难容忍的。周恩来总理说出了我们一致的坚决意志：“中国人民热爱和平，但是为了保卫和平，从不也永不害怕反侵略战争”。所以一旦美帝国主义挑起侵略的战争，中国人民将以一切力量，包括文学艺术所发挥的力量，来彻底消灭美帝国主义和他的帮凶们。因此，为着使保卫和平的艺术武器更加锋利，中国的文学艺术工作者，热诚地期待苏联文化工作者更深一步地教导我们如何以崇高的政治情感，有效地结合一切的文学艺术形式，来教育我们广大的人民，从而更提高了他们勇敢的战斗品质。
    当着伟大苏联的十月革命的节日，中国的文学艺术工作者是以无比的欢欣与感谢，庆祝苏联和平建设的辉煌成就。强大无敌的苏联是世界持久和平与民主的堡垒，它保卫了劳动人民的文化建设，创造了人类空前的幸福和光明。中国的文学艺术工作者将和苏联文化工作者更紧密地团结一道，和世界的各种进步的文化工作者团结一道，来保卫我们伟大的祖国与人类永久的幸福。
