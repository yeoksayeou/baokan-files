　　Jiaotong University Beijing Railway Institute
    Organizes Propaganda Teams for "Train Propaganda"
    Flexible Use of Propaganda Methods Greatly Welcomed by Passengers
    [Our Dispatch] With the strong assistance of the Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, the Beijing Railway Institute of Northern Jiaotong University, drawing on the experience of street propaganda, started "train propaganda" on the Beijing-Tianjin, Beijing-Baotou, Beijing-Shenyang, and Beijing-Shanghai lines on the 19th by various departments. After ten trips, it has now temporarily come to an end. On the trains, they first contacted the train conductor and attendants. Before the propaganda started, the train attendants introduced the team. The passengers expressed great welcome to the propagandists. During the propaganda, not only the passengers in the same carriage listened attentively, but also passengers from other carriages squeezed to both ends of the carriage. Children stopped crying, old people cupped their hands around their ears to listen, and young men and students stared with eyes full of hatred for American imperialism. Wherever the propagandists went, people followed, applause rang out, and hatred for American imperialism was aroused. When many good programs such as living newspapers, dramas, and song and dance could only be performed on the streets and not in the carriages, the students tried their best to use popular forms such as clapper talks, cross-talk, shadow plays, cartoon explanations, Henan opera, and "Little Shepherd Boy" to carry out propaganda with popular lectures. When the singing started, passengers who knew the songs sang along. When passengers raised questions and asked for explanations, the propagandists explained very patiently, explaining again and again if they didn't understand the first time.

    On the trains, many passengers made valuable suggestions to the propagandists. Some passengers even volunteered to perform programs or give speeches. For example, when the Russian Language Department was doing propaganda on the train, writer Chen Baoping used our instruments to perform his own works in public, which was warmly welcomed by the passengers. When the Economics and Transportation Departments were doing propaganda, passengers spontaneously stood up and gave passionate and popular speeches.

    In addition to propaganda on the trains, each department also went down the line to Tianjin, Shunyi County, Kangzhuang, Yulinbao, and other places for propaganda. When the Materials Department students were doing propaganda in Shunyi County, they collaborated with Shunyi Normal School to perform together. County Chief Yue Lin personally came out to welcome them and participated in the students' performance.

    After getting off the train in Kangzhuang, the Economics Department walked three kilometers to Yulinbao to conduct interviews and propaganda. When the propaganda team left, the local villagers reluctantly followed the propaganda team for a long distance.

    Due to the experience gained in street propaganda in Beijing, this performance was very successful. Moreover, the train propaganda from the first day fully proved that the broad masses were eagerly waiting for the students to solve many problems for them. On the train, many passengers with higher cultural levels welcomed the propaganda materials "Jiaoda Jingyuan" and quick reports. For the villagers with lower cultural levels, individual conversations were used. After the propaganda, the passengers' understanding of resisting America and aiding Korea was generally improved.

    In this propaganda, the following unique features of train propaganda were discovered: (1) The audience is non-active, easy to keep quiet, and uses the lonely time to listen attentively, which is conducive to propaganda. (2) The composition of the audience is easy to grasp, and different content and forms can be used to adapt to people with different cultural levels. (3) Individual conversations can be conducted, and it is easy to collect opinions and improve work. (4) Some propaganda forms, such as dance, drama, and living newspapers, cannot be used, while some shadow plays, speeches, clapper talks, Henan opera, and folk tunes are very popular. (5) The effect of train propaganda is quite large, because passengers go to all parts of the country, and its influence is even more widespread. As one passenger said: "Conducting propaganda on the train is equivalent to conducting propaganda to the whole country."

    In this propaganda, the following experiences were also gained: (1) Hard-seat carriages have more working people, propaganda is easy to penetrate, and the effect is great. (2) In the place where the train travels to one-third of the journey, the sound wave transmission is the best, and it can save effort during propaganda. (3) Before the propaganda, close contact must be established with the train conductor and attendants, so that the propaganda work can be carried out more smoothly. (4) It is more difficult to carry out propaganda when the train passengers are very crowded; propaganda should be carried out under normal passenger conditions.

　　交通大学北京铁道学院
    组织宣传队进行“列车宣传” 
    灵活运用宣传方式受到旅客极大欢迎
    【本报讯】北方交通大学北京铁道学院吸收了街头宣传的经验，在天津铁路局北京分局的大力协助下，各系级于十九日在京津、京包、京沈、京沪等线开始了“列车宣传”。前后出动十次，现在已暂时告一段落。在列车上首先与车长及乘务员取得连系，在宣传开始前，先由列车员加以介绍，旅客对宣传员极表欢迎，宣传时不但本车厢里旅客专心听讲，别的车厢的旅客亦挤到车厢两头来。孩子们不哭，老人们用手围起耳朵来倾听，年轻的小伙子与学生们瞪着仇恨美帝的眼睛，宣传员走到那里，人们就跟到那里，那里就响起了掌声，那里就激起了对美帝的憎恨。许多很好的节目如活报剧、话剧与歌舞等只能在街头演出而不能在车厢内演出时，同学们就尽量利用快板、相声、拉洋片、漫画解释、河南坠子、小放牛等大众化的形式，与通俗的讲演来进行宣传。当歌声起来时，会唱的旅客也跟着一块儿唱起来。当旅客们提出问题要求解释时，宣传员都非常耐心的解释，一遍不懂便再解释一遍。
    在列车上，曾有很多旅客向宣传员提出很宝贵的意见。有些旅客还自告奋勇起来表演节目或演讲。如：俄专在列车上宣传时，作家陈宝平将他自己写的作品，借我们的乐器，当众表演。得到旅客们的热烈欢迎。经济系及运输系在宣传时都有旅客们自动站起来激动地作了通俗的讲演。
    不但在车上宣传，各系级还沿线下车到天津、顺义县、康庄、榆林堡等地作了宣传。材料系同学在顺义县宣传时，协同顺义师范学校共同演出，县长岳林还亲自出来欢迎，并参加了同学们的演出会。
    经济系在康庄下车后，步行了三公里到榆林堡去作访问和宣传。在宣传队离开时，当地老乡们都依依不舍地跟在宣传队后面走了一大段路。
    由于在北京街头宣传有了经验，这次演出是很成功的。而且从第一天的列车宣传中充分证明了广大的群众是如渴如饥地等待着同学们去为他们解决许多问题的。在车上许多文化水平较高的旅客对宣传品“交大京院”与快报十分欢迎。对文化程度较低的老乡们，则采用了个别谈话的方式。经过宣传后，普遍提高了旅客对抗美援朝的认识。
    在这次宣传中，发现了列车宣传有其独特的地方：（一）观众非活动性的，易保持安静，利用寂寞的时间，听时专心，利于宣传。（二）观众成份易于掌握，以不同的内容与形式来适应不同文化程度的人们。（三）可以进行个别谈话，易于收集意见，改进工作。（四）有些宣传形式，如舞蹈、话剧、活报剧等不能利用，而一些拉洋片、演讲、快板、河南坠子及乡间小调等则很受欢迎。（五）列车宣传效果相当大，因为旅客是到全国四面八方去的，它的影响范围也就更加广泛。正如一位旅客所说：“在列车上进行宣传，就等于向全国作宣传。”
    在这次宣传中，还得到了下面几点体验：（一）硬席车多劳动人民，宣传易深入，效果大。（二）在列车行进到三分之一路程的地方，音波传递最好，宣传时可以少费劲。（三）宣传前，必须与列车长及乘务员们取得密切的联系，这样才能使宣传工作进行的更加顺利。（四）在列车乘客非常拥挤时，进行宣传比较困难；宣传宜在旅客人数正常条件下进行。
