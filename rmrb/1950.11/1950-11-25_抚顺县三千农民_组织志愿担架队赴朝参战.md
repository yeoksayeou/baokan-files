　　Three Thousand Farmers in Fushun County
    Organize Volunteer Stretcher Team to Participate in the War in Korea
    [Our Newspaper] The masses in Fushun County, Liaodong Province, are eager to support Korea in resisting America and defending the country with practical actions. On November 7th, a stretcher team of more than 3,000 farmers from the county had already departed for the Korean battlefield to participate in the war. Wang Enlin of Mazhou Village said: "American imperialism is just like the Japanese devils, invading Korea and then invading China. I will resolutely fight it to the end to protect the land I have been allocated." Brigades and brigades, platoons and platoons, launched challenges, all preparing to do a good job in transportation, strive to become model members, and return home with meritorious service.
