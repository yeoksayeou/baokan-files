　　For Happiness and Freedom
    ——A Record of the Uprising at the 70th Arsenal
    By our reporter, Lin Li
    When I visited the 70th Arsenal in the capital, the workers were talking with irrepressible anger about the grave situation of American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and Korea, and its attempt to ignite the flames of war on our northeastern border. With extremely激愤mood, the workers asked each other what ways they could use to strike back against American imperialist aggression. Raising their fists, they answered each other: "Imperialism is unreasonable, and it must be dealt with using this kind of stuff."

    Li Boren, the director of the trade union, told me that the workers of today are not the workers they were thirteen years ago when the Japanese寇invaded China. At that time, he was an apprentice in a handicraft workshop. Workers had no freedom of association, no freedom to discuss the current situation or demand resistance against Japan. Therefore, they did not know that the war had broken out until the炮火of Japanese Fascism was upon them. Now, he said, the fact that workers can discuss national affairs is further proof that workers are the masters of the country. Therefore, the workers are closely watching every action of American imperialism with great concern. And they unanimously expressed their determination to respond to the aggressors with practical actions.

    In the past, the 70th Arsenal was engaged in the production of munitions. After liberation, it engaged in peaceful production for the construction of the motherland. These two different production tasks symbolize two different eras and two different lives. Take worker Li Boren, for example. He is a fitter, a skilled worker; but before liberation, he often couldn't get white flour. Because "in the era of the Japanese寇, white flour was a military supply; in the era of the Kuomintang, workers were not allowed to see white flour at all." What Li Boren will never forget is that when American soldiers were stationed in Beijing, he was beaten by Kuomintang military police. That was because Li Boren did not wear leggings when he went to the cinema, and the Kuomintang military police, who were整顿the city to please the American soldiers, viciously slapped his face in public. Covering his swollen face, he wept silently: "This is what the Kuomintang gives us workers." From then on, he never went to the streets or any entertainment venues again. His conclusion was: in Beijing, where American soldiers were stationed, and in Beijing, which was ruled by the Kuomintang, just like in the era of Japanese rule, workers had no freedom. After liberation, he walked onto the sun-drenched streets for the first time, and years of silence disappeared. He participated in studies at the workers' school, actively helped to run the trade union, and he became almost a social activist; he was indispensable at any mass gathering. After being elected as the director of the trade union, he led hundreds of workers in production, learning, and entertainment. In the clamor against American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea, he advocated immediate action to drive the American imperialists out of Taiwan and Korea, and never allow their pig snouts to violate our motherland's borders and friendly neighbors again.

    Wang Xiheng, who has been repairing cannons for many years, said that the specific steps taken by their group of twelve workers to respond to American imperialists is to demand the early resumption of munitions production. He hopes to be able to get a gun, have two hours of military training every day, and be prepared to strike the American imperialist aggressors at any time. Wang Xiheng had seen American soldiers mocking and insulting rickshaw pullers in Beijing, and he also clearly remembered the storm and pain of "squeezing rice" at that time. Once, workers and citizens of the 70th Arsenal crowded密层层at a certain grain store. Just as everyone was抢购, the grain store suddenly closed its doors, and the police and宪兵驱策the hungry crowd and opened fire, shooting through a worker's wrist. However, the workers of the 70th Arsenal were not frightened by the bullets. They tightened their belts,拥挤齐上, surrounded and扭打the宪兵,夺回the枪枝, and threw their钢盔onto the street to kick them as balls. Wang Xiheng is an old worker of twenty-odd years, and for twenty-odd years he has been fighting hunger and poverty in this way. Only after liberation has his life been guaranteed. His current monthly salary can buy six bags of flour, and his family of four is doing quite well. He is enthusiastically pleased with his current happiness, and he knows that life will be even better in the future. However, he said: "Since the American imperialists do not allow us to live a good life, we can only拼with them." His words are full of strength and confidence.

    The young worker Wang Baoxiang was even more excited and anxious than anyone else when he talked about American imperialist aggression. He has spent seven of his twenty-three years in the factory. In the past seven years, he has suffered enough humiliation and欺凌from imperialism. That was when he first entered the factory as an apprentice. The所得for a day's hard work was only a bean cake with the oil extracted. Not to mention that it was bitter and难咽, but also not enough to eat. Once, when he was unbearably hungry, he said "not enough to eat," and the主事人"请"him into the house, and what he was confronted with was a cold wooden bench and a盆of water mixed with辣椒面. The毒刑made him昏迷. When he woke up, he heard讥嘲inquiries: "Are you full this time?!" This is one of the many disasters Wang Baoxiang suffered during the Japanese imperialist era! He said: "The Japanese imperialists treat us workers like this, but the American imperialists are even more cruel and vicious. Isn't the situation in Korea proof of this?" After liberation, he can get more than three hundred斤of millet every month, and he once went to the职工学校to study, participated in the youth department of the分工会, in order to express his firm belief in defending his peaceful life, he wrote a letter expressing his opinion: "Now, the American imperialists are like恶狼in their madness and残暴, and various inhumane acts have been fully exposed in Korea. This behavior threatens the peace and happiness of the people of the world, and is一步步pressing towards China!

    "We cannot tolerate the various crimes of American imperialism. The工友in our unit, especially the young comrades, are already沸腾and怒吼. We have repeatedly stated that we should迎头痛击the American imperialists. We will never allow them to get close to our territory, airspace, and territorial waters. At the same time, we should also help our fraternal country, Korea, to eliminate or drive out the aggressors.

    "We firmly express that, if necessary, we can pick up guns and fight to defend our homes and defend our motherland."

　　为了幸福与自由
    ——记七十兵工厂的怒潮
    本报记者林里
    当我访问首都七十兵工厂的时候，工人们正在怒不可遏地谈论着美帝国主义侵略台湾、朝鲜，并企图把战火燃向我国东北边境的严重时局。工人们以十分激愤的心情，相互询问着用什么方式回击美帝国主义的侵略。他们高举起拳头相互回答着：“帝国主义就是不讲理，非用这玩艺对付不行。”
    工会主任李博仁告诉我，现在的工人，可不是十三年前日寇侵略中国时候的工人了。那时，他在一家手工业工场当学徒。工人没有组织的自由，没有讨论时局和要求抗日的自由。所以，直到日本法西斯的炮火打到头顶上，才知道战争爆发了。现在，他说，工人们能够讨论国家大事，是工人做了国家主人的又一明证。因此，工人们均以万分关切的心情，密切注视着美帝国主义的每一行动。而且一致表示要以实际行动回答侵略者。
    过去，七十兵工厂是从事军火生产的，解放以后才为祖国的建设事业从事和平生产。两种不同的生产任务，标志着两个不同的时代，和两种不同的生活。就以工友李博仁来说吧，他是钳工，是一个技术工人；但在解放以前，他经常吃不到白面。因为“日寇时代白面是军用品；国民党时代白面根本不让工人见。”使李博仁永生不能忘记的是美国兵驻扎在北京的时候，他曾遭到国民党宪兵的毒打。那是因为李博仁去电影院没有打裹腿，为了讨好美国兵而整顿市容的国民党宪兵在大庭广众之下狠毒地打了他的嘴巴。他掩着红肿的脸暗泣着：“这就是国民党所给予我们工人的。”从此他再也不到大街和任何娱乐场合去了。他的结论是：美国兵驻扎着的北平，国民党统治着的北平，和日寇统治时代一样，工人是没有任何自由的。解放后他第一次走到阳光充沛的街上，几年的沉默消失了。他参加了职工学校的学习，积极地帮助办工会，他几乎成了社会活动家，任何群众场合少不了他。他被选为工会主任后，领导着几百工人生产、学习和娱乐。在反对美帝国主义侵略台湾、朝鲜的声浪中，他主张立即行动，把美帝国主义者赶出台湾、朝鲜，永不许它的猪嘴再触犯我们祖国的边疆及友邻。
    历年来做着修理大炮工作的王锡恒，他说他们组的十二个工人，回答美帝国主义者的具体步骤是要求早日恢复军火生产。他希望能够拿到一支枪，每天有两小时的军事学习，准备随时打击美帝国主义侵略者。王锡恒见过美国兵在北京时对三轮工人的嘲笑和侮辱，他也清清楚楚地记得那时“挤米”的风暴和痛苦。一次，七十兵工厂的工人和市民，密层层地拥挤在某粮栈。正当大家抢购之间，粮栈忽然关闭了门，警宪驱策着饥饿的人群，并举枪射击，打穿了一个工友的手腕。然而七十兵工厂的工人没有被枪弹所吓倒，他们勒紧了腰带，一拥齐上，包围和扭打了宪兵，夺回了枪枝，并把他们的钢盔抛掷到街上当球踢。王锡恒是二十几年的老工人，二十几年来一直这样与饥馑和贫困搏斗着。只有解放以后，生活才有了保障。他现在每月的工资可以买到六袋面粉，一家四口过得满好。他热情地欣慰着现在的幸福，他知道往后的生活会更好。然而他说：“既然美帝国主义者不允许咱们过好日子，咱们就只有和他拚。”他的话充满着力量和自信。
    青年工人王宝祥，谈到美帝国主义的侵略比任何人更激动，也更焦急。在他二十三年的生涯中，有七年是在工厂里度过的。七年来他受够了帝国主义的侮辱和欺凌。那是他刚进工厂当学徒的时候，辛劳一天的所得，只是一块抽了油的豆饼。不用说苦涩难咽，而且吃不饱。有一次，他在饥饿难忍的时候，说了一句“不够吃”，主事人就把他“请”到房子里，对付他的是一条冷板凳，一盆拌着辣椒面的水。毒刑使他昏迷了。当苏醒过来的时候，他听到了讥嘲的询问：“这回可吃饱了吧！？”这是王宝祥在日本帝国主义时代所遭受的许多灾难中的一次！他说：“日本帝国主义这样对待我们工人，美帝国主义是更残暴，更毒辣的，朝鲜的事实不就是证明吗？”解放后，他每月可以拿到三百多斤小米，并一度进职工学校学习，参加了分工会的青年部工作，为了表明他保卫和平生活的坚定信念，他写信表示他的意见：“现在，美帝国主义者恶狼似的疯狂与残暴，以及各种不人道的行为，在朝鲜充分暴露出来了。这种行为威胁着全世界人民的和平与幸福，并且步步向中国进逼！
    “对于美帝的各种罪行，我们实在不能容忍了。我们本单位的工友，尤其是青年同志，已经沸腾了，怒吼了。一再表示我们应该给美帝国主义者以迎头痛击。决不允许他们靠近我们的领土、领空与领海。同时还应该帮助我们的兄弟国朝鲜，把侵略者消灭或打出去。
    “我们坚决表示，必要时我们可以拿起枪杆为保卫家乡、保卫祖国而战斗。”
