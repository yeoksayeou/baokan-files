　　On Ideological and Political Education in Schools
　　Jiang Nanxiang
　　Schools in New Democratic China should cultivate talent for the construction of China's New Democratic cause. For these future builders of New China, we not only require them to have rich knowledge, but also to have a revolutionary outlook on life and a clear and firm political direction, and to serve the motherland and the people loyally. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct ideological and political education in schools, which is one of the fundamental characteristics that distinguishes the New Democratic education policy from the feudal and comprador education policies of old China.
　　Since liberation, all universities and middle schools across the country have added compulsory public political courses and carried out enthusiastic ideological remolding movements. Generally speaking, this ideological and political education has been successful, and the achievements should be regarded as the main aspect. It cannot be denied that ideological and political education in schools has played a role in the tremendous progress made by students across the country in their political understanding since liberation. However, we should also point out that some errors or shortcomings have occurred in some schools in the process of conducting ideological and political education. In order to improve future work, it is necessary to review and overcome these shortcomings.

　　　　I. The Main Goal of Ideological and Political Education

　　"The culture and education of the People's Republic of China are New Democratic, that is, national, scientific, and mass culture and education. The main tasks of the people's government's cultural and educational work should be to raise the people's cultural level, cultivate talent for national construction, eliminate feudal, comprador, and fascist ideologies, and develop the idea of serving the people." - This is the New Democratic cultural and educational policy clearly stipulated in the Common Program, and it is also the guideline that ideological and political education in schools should follow. This means that the purpose of ideological and political education is mainly to oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and not others.

　　Due to the great victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary movement, the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, which had been doing evil in China for many years, has been overthrown. However, they are not reconciled to this failure, and they are still trying their best to adopt various despicable and shameless methods to carry out open and secret sabotage activities from both inside and outside our country. American imperialism even openly occupied Taiwan by force. Its war of aggression against Korea has directly threatened our country's borders. The vicious attempt of American imperialism is to stir up the flames of a war of aggression and hinder the progress of New China. Therefore, the most dangerous and main enemies of the Chinese people at present are still American imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek remnant group. The most intense and fierce struggle at present is still the struggle of the alliance of all democratic classes in China, led by the working class, against American imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, and is definitely not the struggle of the proletariat against the non-proletariat. Ideological and political education in schools must reflect this actual situation and serve the victory of this actual struggle.

　　"Some schools have largely solved the problem of opposing imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Therefore, can they further regard the remolding of non-proletarian ideology as the main goal of ideological and political education?" - Of course, this cannot be assumed. Although the situations of various schools are not completely the same, and even the differences between some schools are still very large, and therefore this should be fully considered when conducting ideological and political education, and there should be differences in specific steps and methods, generally speaking, all schools in the People's Republic of China today - whether public or private, liberated earlier or later - should strengthen the struggle against American imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, as the main direction of ideological and political education in order to consolidate and develop the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. This is completely certain and beyond doubt. To oppose feudal, comprador, and fascist ideas is essentially to strengthen patriotic education and internationalist education. Simply raising your hand to support opposition to American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries does not mean that the requirement has been met. More importantly, it is necessary to cultivate the fine qualities of young people who are loyal to the motherland and to the cause of the people's revolution. It is necessary to encourage young people to have lofty enthusiasm for loving the motherland, loving the people, and loving the people's leader Mao Zedong, and to stimulate young people's deep hatred for the enemies who endanger the motherland and destroy peace - the American imperialist aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries. It is necessary to arm the minds of young people with rich scientific knowledge so that they can more powerfully participate in the struggle to defend the motherland and defend peace. Carrying out patriotic and internationalist education is the main task of ideological and political education in all schools across the country for a long time, and it is not a problem that can be completely solved in a very short period.

　　　　II. Studying Marxism-Leninism and Remolding Non-Proletarian Ideology

　　Of course, the task of ideological and political education is not only to promote the spirit of patriotism and internationalism, and to oppose feudal, comprador, and fascist ideas, but also to use the standpoint and viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism to criticize and transform various other erroneous ideas. The two are parallel and do not contradict each other. Among non-proletarian ideas, some cannot adapt to the requirements of the common life of all classes in a New Democratic country, and necessary transformations should be carried out according to these common requirements. However, we must clearly recognize that opposing feudal, comprador, and fascist ideas is one thing, and opposing certain erroneous ideas within the people's democratic united front is another. We should and must resolutely oppose the reactionary ideas of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries without any doubt, and we must never adopt a laissez-faire attitude. Every patriotic citizen has the responsibility to severely crack down on those who betray the motherland and the ideas that betray the motherland. However, for the non-proletarian erroneous views that are prevalent among petty-bourgeois intellectuals, we can only adopt long-term patient persuasion and guidance, and gradually inspire them to carry out self-education and self-transformation on a conscious and voluntary basis.

　　Marxism-Leninism is the most advanced science. It has guided the Chinese people to achieve historical victories, and it will continue to guide the Chinese people to achieve more victories. Therefore, we should call on and encourage young students across the country to study Marxism-Leninism hard and to transform their erroneous ideas from the old society in accordance with the spirit of Marxism-Leninism, establish a correct world outlook and outlook on life, and understand the historical laws of social development and the Chinese revolution, so that they can better serve the people. It is wrong to adopt a negative or passive attitude towards transforming various erroneous ideological viewpoints existing among intellectuals, because without such transformation, it will not be possible to meet the greatest needs of the revolutionary cause and construction work in New China. But this does not mean that in the current schools, only proletarian Marxist-Leninist thought is allowed to be legal, and all other non-proletarian thoughts are illegal. The reason why Marxism-Leninism has become a victorious science and won the highest trust of the Chinese people is because of its superior scientific nature, not because of legal regulations. Although we have opened Marxist-Leninist political courses in schools and try our best to enable students to better understand and master Marxism-Leninism, in fact, we cannot therefore require every student to become a proficient Marxist-Leninist, just as we have opened courses such as Chinese and mathematics in schools and also hope that students can learn these courses as well as possible, but in fact, we cannot therefore require every student to become a writer or a mathematician. In a New Democratic China where various democratic classes jointly exercise dictatorship, in general universities and middle schools that have only recently inherited from the old China, it is not in line with the objective situation or the spirit of the Common Program to attempt to deny the legitimate existence of non-proletarian ideas.

　　Chairman Mao gave such thorough instructions in his work "On New Democracy": "Since the current Chinese revolution cannot be separated from the leadership of the Chinese proletariat, the current Chinese new culture cannot be separated from the Chinese proletariat's cultural thought, that is, cannot be separated from the leadership of communist thought. ... At present, there is no doubt that the propaganda of communist thought should be expanded and the study of Marxism-Leninism should be intensified. Without such propaganda and study, it is not only impossible to guide the Chinese revolution to the future socialist stage, but also impossible to guide the current democratic revolution to victory. However, the basic nature of current national culture is not socialist, but New Democratic, because it is a culture of the people's masses that is anti-imperialist and anti-feudal, not a culture of the proletariat that is anti-capitalist. Therefore, we should not only distinguish between the propaganda of the communist ideological system and social system and the practice of the New Democratic action program, but also distinguish between the communist method as a way of observing problems, researching learning, and handling work, and the New Democratic policy as a national culture. It is undoubtedly very inappropriate to confuse the two" - That is to say, on the one hand, it is necessary to publicize and study Marxism-Leninism, and on the other hand, one cannot indiscriminately confuse the propaganda of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the New Democratic program.

　　Some schools have not understood the spirit of Chairman Mao's above-mentioned instructions, but have precisely confused the study of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the New Democratic program, and have inappropriately stipulated "transforming non-proletarian ideas" as the task to be completed by the ideological and political education in general schools at the present time. They indiscriminately copied the "rectification movement" experience of the Communist Party cadre schools, and adopted methods such as "ideological summary" and "democratic evaluation" to launch a wave of criticism of non-proletarian ideas among all students (some including teachers). As a result, in this vigorous ideological remolding movement, the first to be attacked by everyone's concentrated firepower was not feudal, comprador, and fascist ideas, but - "individual liberalism", "supra-class viewpoints", "purely technical viewpoints", "individual heroism", etc. This made us unable to distinguish between friends and enemies on the ideological front, unable to distinguish between the main and the secondary, confused our own struggle goals, and disrupted our steps.

　　It is natural to advocate transforming the various erroneous ideas of petty-bourgeois intellectuals and establishing the viewpoints and ideological methods of Marxism-Leninism, but this should be based on the level of awareness of the masses, with the principle of enlightening their conscious and voluntary participation. If the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League branches in the school put forward this requirement to their own party members and league members, or to some activists with relatively progressive ideas who are not party members or league members but are willing to accept this strict Marxist-Leninist requirement, then it is of course possible and very good. However, for general young students who grew up in old China and received education for a relatively long period of time, they have received relatively little Marxist-Leninist education and their political level is relatively low; if they are not only required to study Marxist-Leninist political courses, but also indiscriminately required to meet strict Marxist-Leninist standards to liquidate all their non-proletarian ideas, then it is obviously inappropriate. (In fact, even among Communist Party members, there is a distinction between new party members and old party members, and they cannot be treated the same.) This approach will create a kind of "coercive" behavior and an excessively tense atmosphere for some people, even possibly for a relatively large number of people, thereby producing many side effects. The mastery of Marxism-Leninism must rely on each person's own ideological understanding and cannot rely on external coercion. A person can be forced to engage in physical labor, but one can never be forced to become a conscious revolutionary. Leaving aside the realistic level of awareness of the masses, hoping to use the method of "coercion" to solve the ideological problems of the masses, even wanting to use the combat method of storming the enemy's position to "besiege the backward ideological fortress," then despite flaunting Marxism-Leninism, the essence is precisely a violation of Marxism-Leninism.

　　　　III. The Long-Term Nature of Ideological and Political Education and the Direction of Future Efforts

　　Thoroughly transforming the thinking of the broad masses must go through a long and complex educational process. We must never be impatient. Whether in society or in schools, the existence of old ideas and old habits is not formed in a day or two, but gradually grows up under the long-term influence of the old society. Lenin said: "The force of habit of millions is the most terrible force." Overcoming this habit force, which is universal and deeply rooted in people's traditional thinking, is even many times more difficult than overthrowing the most brutal imperialism. The People's Liberation Army can defeat the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries directly supported by American imperialism in three years, driving them completely out of mainland China, but we can never completely eliminate the bad ideas and bad habits left over from the old Chinese society in three years. Thought is a reflection of the objective world in the human brain. Thoroughly transforming the thinking of the broad masses, strictly speaking, is not just a matter of changing the form of consciousness - simply replacing one "concept" with another "concept", but also changing the material environment, changing the objective world that acts on people's minds, which of course cannot be a short-term but only a long-term thing. Chairman Mao instructed in his report at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: "Carry out the reform of the existing school education and the existing social and cultural undertakings step by step and cautiously... Delaying the time and disregarding the idea of reform is wrong, and the idea of being too impatient and attempting to carry out reform by crude methods is also wrong."

　　Many schools do not recognize or do not fully recognize this long-term and complex nature of ideological transformation, and hope that through short-term study of political courses in schools, or even just through one ideological summary movement, they can "defeat all non-proletarian ideas" and "thoroughly complete the ideological liberation war." But all past experience has proved that hoping to use this simplified short-term blitz method to completely solve ideological problems can only lead to "things going contrary to wishes and wanting to be quick but not achieving results."

　　In the past, ideological and political education in schools almost completely became the task solely responsible for by political courses, which was necessary and correct in the early days of liberation during the transition from the old to the new. But from a long-term point of view, the ideological and political education in schools should not only be the task solely undertaken by political courses, but should become a regular task jointly undertaken by all courses in the school. Every subject in the school should not only impart a certain kind of knowledge, but also implement correct ideological content, publicize and consolidate students' dialectical materialist world outlook and the outlook on life of serving the people to a certain extent, and promote the spirit of patriotism and internationalism. Only when all courses in the school can simultaneously share the task of ideological and political education and cooperate with each other can the ideological and political education in schools achieve the greatest effect and become an inseparable organic component of the entire educational process of the school. In the situation where the school curriculum has not been thoroughly transformed shortly after liberation and there is a great lack of excellent teachers of all subjects who are proficient in Marxism-Leninism, it is naturally not possible to fully achieve this quickly, but in any case, this is the direction in which ideological and political education in schools should strive in the future.

　　论学校中的思想政治教育
　　蒋南翔
    新民主主义中国的学校，是要为中国新民主主义的建设事业培养人才，对于这些未来的新中国的建设者，我们不但要求他们具有丰富的知识，而且要求他们具有革命的人生观和明确坚定的政治方向，忠诚地为祖国为人民服务。因此，在学校中，进行思想政治教育是必要的，这是新民主主义教育方针区别于旧中国封建性和买办性的教育方针的根本特点之一。
    解放以后，全国各大学和中学，都增设了公共必修的政治课程，进行了热烈的思想改造运动，一般地说，这种思想政治教育都是有成绩的，而且成绩应该估计为主要的一面，解放以来全国广大学生所以在政治认识上获得猛烈的进步，不能否认学校中的思想政治教育是起了它的作用。但同时我们还应该指出：在进行思想政治教育的过程中，曾经在有些学校当中发生过某些错误或缺点，为了改进今后的工作，需要检讨和克服这些缺点。
            一、思想政治教育的主要目标
    “中华人民共和国的文化教育为新民主主义的，即民族的、科学的、大众的文化教育。人民政府的文化教育工作，应以提高人民文化水平，培养国家建设人才，肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想，发展为人民服务的思想为主要任务。”——这是共同纲领所明白规定的新民主主义的文化教育政策，同时也是现在学校中思想政治教育所应当遵循的准绳。这就是说，思想政治教育的目的，主要在于反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义，而不是其他。
    由于中国人民革命运动的伟大胜利，帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义在中国作恶多年的反动统治是已经被推翻，但是他们对于这种失败是不甘心的，他们仍在处心积虑地采取各种卑鄙无耻的办法，从我们国家的外部和内部来进行公开的和秘密的破坏活动。美帝国主义甚至公然用武力侵占台湾，他对朝鲜的侵略战争，已经直接威胁到我们国家的边疆。美帝国主义的恶毒的企图就是要煽起侵略战争的火焰，阻碍新中国的前进。因此，当前中国人民最危险最主要的敌人，仍然是美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石残余集团，当前最紧张剧烈的斗争，仍然是以工人阶级为领导的中国各民主阶级的联盟对于美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石反动派的斗争，决不是无产阶级对于非无产阶级的斗争；学校中的思想政治教育，也就必须反映这种实际情况，并为争取这种实际斗争的胜利而服务。
    “关于反对帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的问题，有些学校已经大体解决，因此他们是不是可以进一步以改造非无产阶级思想作为思想政治教育的主要目标呢？”——当然不能这样设想。尽管各个学校的情况不尽相同，甚至某些学校之间差异还是很大，因而在进行思想政治教育的时候应该充分考虑到这一点，在具体的步骤上方式上有所不同，但总的说来，今天中华人民共和国所有的学校——不论是公立还是私立，解放较早还是较迟，为了巩固和发展中国人民革命的胜利，一律都应把加强反对美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石反动派的斗争，作为思想政治教育的主要方向，这一点，是完全肯定而毫无疑义的。反对封建的、买办的、法西斯的思想，实质即是要加强爱国主义教育和国际主义教育，举手赞成反对美帝国主义和蒋介石反动派，并不就算是达到了要求，更重要的，是要培养青年忠于祖国，忠于人民革命事业的优良品质，是要鼓舞青年爱祖国、爱人民、爱人民领袖毛泽东的崇高热情，激发青年对于危害祖国破坏和平的敌人——美帝国主义侵略者和蒋介石反动派的深刻仇恨；是要以丰富的科学知识武装青年的头脑，使他们能够更有力地去参加保卫祖国和保卫和平的斗争。进行爱国主义和国际主义的教育，这是全国所有学校长时期内思想政治教育的主要课题，不是很短时期就可完全解决的问题。
            二、学习马列主义与改造非无产阶级思想
    当然，思想政治教育的任务，不但是要发扬爱国主义和国际主义的精神，反对封建的、买办的、法西斯的思想，而且也是要运用马克思列宁主义的立场和观点，来批判和改造其他各种错误的思想，这二者是并行不悖的。在非无产阶级的思想中，有些不能适应于新民主主义国家中各阶级的共同生活的要求，应该按照这种共同的要求而进行必要的改造。但是我们必须明确认识：反对封建的、买办的、法西斯的思想是一回事，反对人民民主统一战线内部的某些错误思想，又是另外一回事。我们对于美帝国主义和蒋介石反动派的反动思想，毫无疑义地应该而且必须坚决反对，绝不能采取自由放任态度。严厉地打击背叛祖国的人们和背叛祖国的思想，每个爱国公民都有这种责任。但是对于普遍存在于小资产阶级知识分子中间的若干非无产阶级的错误观点，我们就只能采取长期的耐心的说服和诱导的方式，逐渐地启发他们在自觉自愿的基础上，实行自我教育和自我改造。
    马克思列宁主义是最先进的科学，它已指导中国人民获得了历史性的胜利，还将继续指导中国人民获得更多的胜利，因此我们应该号召和鼓励全国学生青年，努力学习马克思、列宁主义，并根据马列主义精神来改造自己从旧社会得来的错误思想，建立正确的世界观和人生观，了解社会发展和中国革命的历史规律，以便能更好地为人民服务。对于改造存在于知识分子中的各种错误思想观点，采取否定态度或消极态度是不对的，因为不进行这种改造，就将不能适应新中国革命事业和建设工作的最大需要。但这并不是说，在现在的学校当中，只有无产阶级的马列主义思想是被允许为合法的，其他非无产阶级的思想则都是非法的。马列主义所以成为胜利的科学并取得中国人民的最高信任，是依靠自己优越的科学性，不是依靠法律上的规定。我们虽然在学校当中开设了马列主义的政治课程，并且尽量要使学生能够更好地领会和掌握马列主义，但事实上，并不能因此就要求每个学生都能成为精通的马列主义者，正如我们虽然在学校当中开设了国文数学等课程，并且也希望学生能够尽量学好这些课程，但在事实上，并不能因此就要求每个学生都能成为文学家或数学家。在各个民主阶级联合专政的新民主主义中国，在不久以前方从旧中国承继过来的一般大学和中学，如要企图否认非无产阶级思想的合法存在，这是不符合客观情况，也不符合共同纲领的精神的。
    毛主席在新民主主义论的著作中有过这样透彻的指示：“由于现时中国革命不能离开中国无产阶级的领导，因而现时的中国新文化也不能离开中国无产阶级文化思想，即不能离开共产主义思想的领导。……在现时，毫无疑义，应该扩大共产主义思想的宣传，加紧马列主义的学习，没有这种宣传与学习，不但不能引导中国革命到将来的社会主义阶段上去，而且也不能指导现时的民主革命到胜利。但是现时国民文化的基本性质，却不是社会主义的，而是新民主主义的，因为它是人民大众反帝反封建的文化，不是无产阶级反资本主义的文化。因此，我们既应把对于共产主义的思想体系与社会制度的宣传、与对于新民主主义的行动纲领的实践区别开来，又应把作为观察问题研究学问处理工作的共产主义的方法、与作为国民文化的新民主主义的方针区别开来。把二者混为一谈，无疑是很不适当的”——这就是说，一方面，需要宣传和学习马列主义，另一方面，又不能把马列主义的宣传和新民主主义纲领的实践，不加区别地混为一谈。
    有一些学校，没有领会毛主席上述指示的精神，恰恰是把马列主义的学习和新民主主义纲领的实践混为一谈，不恰当地把“改造非无产阶级的思想”，规定为现时一般学校中思想政治教育所要完成的任务，他们不加分析地搬用了共产党干部学校的“整风运动”经验，采取“思想总结”“民主评定”等方式，在全体学生中（有的包括教师在内）掀起批判非无产阶级思想的热潮，于是在这种如火如荼的思想改造运动中，首先受到大家集中火力的攻击的，不是封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想，而是——“个人自由主义”，“超阶级观点”，“单纯技术观点”，“个人英雄主义”等等，这就使我们在思想战线上，分不清敌友，分不清主要和次要，自己混淆了斗争目标，弄乱了步伐。
    改造小资产阶级知识分子的各种错误思想，树立马克思列宁主义的观点和思想方法，自然是应该提倡的，但是这要根据群众的觉悟水平，以启发他们的自觉自愿为原则。如果学校中共产党和青年团的支部对于自己的党员和团员提出这种要求，或者是对于某些思想比较进步的积极分子，他们虽然不是党员团员，但却自愿接受这种严格的马列主义的要求，那当然是可以而且很好的。但是对于在旧中国生长并受了较长时期教育的一般青年学生来说，他们所受的马列主义教育还是比较少，他们的政治水平还是比较低；如果不仅是要他们学习马列主义的政治课程，而且不分青红皂白，一概要以严格的马列主义的标准来要求他们，要清算他们所有的非无产阶级思想，那就显然是不适当的了。（其实就在共产党员中，新党员和老党员还有分别，不能一律看待）这种做法，对于某些人，甚至可能是对于比较多数的人，将会造成一种“强制”的行为和过份紧张的空气，从而产生许多副作用。马列主义的掌握，必须依靠各人自己思想上的领会，不能依靠外力的强制。可以强迫一个人从事体力劳动，但绝不能强迫一个人成为自觉的革命者。离开了群众现实的觉悟水平，希望用“强制”的办法来解决群众的思想问题，甚至要用冲锋陷阵的作战方式，“围攻落后的思想堡垒”，那么尽管标榜的是马列主义，但实质恰恰是违反了马列主义。
            三、思想政治教育的长期性及今后应该努力的方向
    彻底改造广大群众的思想，必须经历长期的和复杂的教育过程。决不能性急。无论在社会上或是学校中，旧思想和旧习惯的存在，不是形成于一朝一日，而是在旧社会的长期影响下面逐渐地生长起来的。列宁说：“千百万人的习惯势力是最可怕的势力”。我们要克服这种普遍而根深蒂固地存在于人们传统思想中的习惯势力，甚至比打倒最凶暴的帝国主义还要困难许多倍。人民解放军可以在三年之内，将美帝国主义直接支援下的蒋介石反动派打得落花流水，把他们完全驱逐出中国大陆，但我们却绝不可能在三年之内，将中国旧社会遗留下来的坏思想坏习惯完全肃清。思想是客观世界在人类头脑中的反映，彻底改造广大群众的思想，认真的说，这不仅仅是改变观念形态——简单地用一种“观念”去代替另一种“观念”的问题，而且还要改变物质环境，改变作用于人们头脑的客观世界，这当然就不能是短期而只能是长期的事。毛主席在中共七届三中全会的报告中这样指示：“有步骤地谨慎地进行旧有学校教育事业和旧有社会文化事业的改革工作……拖延时间不顾改革的思想是不对的，过于性急、企图用粗暴方法进行改革的思想也是不对的。”
    有许多学校，对于思想改造的这种长期性和复杂性不认识或认识不足，希望通过学校中政治课程的短期学习，甚至仅仅通过一次思想总结运动，就能“打垮一切非无产阶级思想”，“彻底完成思想上的解放战争”。但历来的经验都证明：希望用这种简单化的短促突击的方法来彻底解决思想问题，结果只能是“事与愿违，欲速则不达”。
    过去学校中的思想政治教育，几乎完全成为政治课程所单独负责的任务，这在新旧交替的解放初期，是必要的和正确的。但从长远的观点说，那么学校中的思想政治教育，应该不仅仅是政治课程所单独担当的任务，而是应该成为学校中全部课程所共同担任的经常任务。学校中的每一门功课，都不仅要传授某一种知识，同时还应该贯彻着正确的思想内容，在一定程度上宣传并巩固学生辩证唯物主义的世界观及为人民服务的人生观，发扬爱国主义思想和国际主义思想。只有在学校中的全部课程均能同时分担思想政治教育的任务，互相配合，方能使学校中的思想政治教育收到最大效果，成为学校整个教育过程中的不可分割的有机组成部分。在解放不久，学校课程还没有能彻底改造，精通马列主义的各科优秀教师还深感不足的情况下，自然还不能很快就完全做到这一点，但无论如何，这总是今后学校中思想政治教育所应该努力的方向。
