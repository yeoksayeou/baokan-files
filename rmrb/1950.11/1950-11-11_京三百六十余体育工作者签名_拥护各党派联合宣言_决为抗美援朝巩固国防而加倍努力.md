　　Beijing Sports Workers Sign Declaration Supporting Joint Declaration of All Parties
　　Resolving to Redouble Efforts to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Consolidate National Defense
    [Report from this newspaper] The Preparatory Committee of the All-China Sports Federation and its Beijing Branch held a current affairs report meeting for Beijing sports workers at the Youth Palace at 7 pm on the 9th of this month. Gao Tang, Deputy Director and Secretary-General of the Sports Federation, reported on the current situation. The 363 sports workers who attended the meeting signed and issued the following declaration:
    We, the sports workers of Beijing, resolutely support the joint declaration issued by all democratic parties on November 4th. This is a righteous call, a solemn oath, and it represents the determination of the people of the whole country to unite as one to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country. The reactionary group headed by US imperialism, disregarding the warnings of the Chinese people and the people of the world, has frantically launched a war of aggression against Korea, while at the same time invading our territory of Taiwan, and intruding into our Northeast airspace dozens of times. Recently, it has even more arrogantly and shamelessly denied the Yalu River as the border between China and Korea, attempting to expand the war, which seriously threatens the security of the motherland.
    The people of the whole country are roaring! We sports workers can no longer endure this. We must actively participate in the just action of the people of the whole country to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country. We know that the development of sports can greatly help consolidate national defense. We must redouble our efforts to do our job well. We are determined to fight resolutely against US imperialist aggression and to defend our motherland!

　　京三百六十余体育工作者签名
　　拥护各党派联合宣言
　　决为抗美援朝巩固国防而加倍努力
    【本报讯】中华全国体育总会筹备委员会及北京市分会于本月九日晚七时在青年宫举行北京市体育工作者时事报告大会，体总副主任兼秘书长高棠报告目前形势。参加大会的三百六十三名体育工作者签名发表宣言如下：
    我们北京市的体育工作者坚决的拥护十一月四日发表的各民主党派联合宣言，这是正义的呼声，庄严的宣誓，它代表着全国人民团结一致抗美援朝保家卫国的决心。  以美帝国主义为首的反动集团，不顾中国人民和全世界人民的警告，疯狂的发动侵朝战争，同时侵入我国领土台湾，并数十次侵入我国东北领空，最近更狂妄无耻的否认鸭绿江为中朝边界，企图把战火扩大，这就严重的威胁了祖国的安全。
    全国人民怒吼了！我们体育工作者再也不能忍受了，我们要积极参加全国人民抗美援朝保家卫国的正义行动。我们知道体育运动的开展，对巩固国防有极大帮助，我们要加倍努力搞好自己的工作。我们决心为反对美帝国主义侵略，为保卫祖国而坚决斗争！
