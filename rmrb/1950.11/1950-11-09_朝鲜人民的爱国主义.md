　　The Patriotism of the Korean People
　　By Kim Sung-yong, Chief of the China Branch of the Korean Central News Agency
　　(I)
　　The Korean people have unanimously responded to General Kim Il-sung's call to "concentrate all forces to give the enemy a decisive blow and completely and thoroughly eliminate the foreign armed invaders and their lackeys—the traitorous Lee Seung-man clique" . The Korean people have widely armed themselves to fight for the final victory of the Fatherland Liberation War.
　　The Korean War is a war for the Korean people to strive for national independence and liberation, and at the same time, it is a sacred struggle to smash the US aggression against Asia and the destruction of world peace. World peace must not be undermined by imperialist war-mongers, and the people of Asia must strive for independence and freedom. The Korean people's war for the liberation of their fatherland will surely be victorious.
　　The American aggressors' frenzied invasion and their most barbaric crimes against the Korean people have not and will never be able to crush the Korean people's resolute will to strive for the liberation of their fatherland, but have made the Korean people's patriotism even higher.
　　The Korean people have lofty patriotism. Korea's patriotic war is fully equipped with the conditions for inevitable victory.
　　The Korean people have long experienced the pain of enslavement under Japanese imperialism and the rule of American imperialism and its puppet Lee Seung-man in South Korea. We deeply understand the significance of the Liberation War to us. The Korean people's heroic anti-aggression war is not due to any temporary factors, but for the fundamental interests of our nation. Our national liberation war is entirely a just and patriotic war.
　　The Korean people's fatherland liberation war has the same nature as the liberation wars of the oppressed nations of the East. The Eastern national liberation movement is a long-term and just struggle for national independence and freedom under imperialist aggression. This struggle is an important part of the struggle for lasting world peace and for people's democracy. The struggle to defend peace all over the world is being carried out victoriously. The Korean people are currently standing at the forefront of the struggle to defend world peace.
　　The Korean people are very clearly aware that for the freedom, independence and prosperity of the motherland, and for the happy life of themselves and their descendants for generations to come, there is only one road—the road of national liberation struggle. History has repeatedly proven that people who fight for peace and for the interests of the people will eventually win victory. The Soviet people achieved victory in the war against foreign aggressors, and the Chinese people achieved victory in the war against Japanese imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang supported by the United States, both proving that the above historical conclusion is correct.
　　(II)
　　The Korean people have a heroic People's Army. They come from the people and fight for the people. They are armed with patriotism for the liberation of the motherland and the prosperity of the nation, armed with internationalism, and armed with advanced military technology and war experience. They have the tradition of General Kim Il-sung's heroic anti-Japanese war, excellent political leadership, and conscious discipline. In this war against American aggressors, countless brilliant achievements and victories have proved the excellent qualities of the Korean People's Army.
　　The Korean People's Army is a heroic army. This heroism is manifested in the battles to liberate Seoul and Daejeon and to advance to the Nakdong River, in countless river-crossing operations, naval operations, air operations, and battles for high ground, and also in the heroic and courageous defensive battles to eliminate the enemy's vital forces, such as the Wolmido defense battle and the Seoul defense battle when the enemy landed at Incheon and frantically invaded. These excellent qualities are the guarantee of defeating superior enemies. The Korean People's Army not only has tens of thousands of brave soldiers, but also excellent commanding officers. It is this combination of patriotism and military technology that has caused the American aggressors to suffer many defeats.
　　The strength of the Korean People's Army has not weakened or decreased as the American bandits hoped during the organized retreat. On the contrary, this force is increasing and consolidating in battle.
　　The Korean people have brave People's Guerrilla forces. Guerrilla warfare is an important form of struggle in the national liberation movement. The role of the People's Guerrilla forces is enormous. They contain enemy forces, destroy enemy strongholds and transportation lines, disrupt enemy operational plans, and prevent the Lee Seung-man fascist barbaric "rule" from being rebuilt in vast areas. The Korean People's Guerrilla forces have patriotism to fight for the fundamental interests of the nation. They inherit the tradition of General Kim Il-sung's anti-Japanese guerrilla war and have the arduous and valuable experience of fighting against the American and Lee bandit troops in the past five years. In this war against the American aggressors, they are cooperating with the People's Army to fight and have enriched their combat experience. Now their strength is unprecedentedly strong.
　　The People's Guerrilla forces fighting behind enemy lines, holding high the banner of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, have become the center of patriotic forces uniting the people. The broad masses of the Korean people are continuously joining the People's Guerrilla forces and the Volunteer Army. The ranks of joining the army will not stop until the last one of the 30 million people. In this way, in the great national liberation struggle, we have this indispensable and important people's armed force.
　　Armed force is a basic condition for the victory of the national liberation movement.
　　The Korean people are an organized people. Her 30 million people, including workers, farmers, youth, women, intellectuals, and all adults, except for a small handful of traitorous Lee Seung-man groups, are firmly united under the banner of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and around the Fatherland Front. The Korean people have their dearest and wisest leader, General Kim Il-sung, and the leadership of the Workers' Party, which is armed with Marxism-Leninism. Thirty million Korean people are consolidated and united in the war for national liberation. The strength of the Korean people is endless.
　　The Korean people have become the masters of their own country. The Korean people have elected their own people's regime through democratic elections. Our regime has carried out great democratic reforms and completed the economic construction plan ahead of schedule, exceeding the target. These many democratic measures have laid a solid material foundation for the republic. This kind of people's regime cannot be destroyed by any violence.
　　Over the past five years, the Korean people's patriotism has grown like a roaring wave and has been consolidated. Forty years of life as slaves of a fallen country is deeply imprinted in the hearts of every Korean person. They all have the determination to improve their political and cultural level and enhance the strength of their country. Over the past five years, the Korean people have achieved great achievements in the work of building their own country with the assistance of the great Soviet Union. The Korean people are a nation that knows how to decide and solve their own destiny. The Korean people have experienced in their actual lives which is the enemy and which is the friend between imperialism and socialism. They resolutely oppose the imperialism that is heading towards extinction and stand on the side of the socialist and democratic camp.
　　The Korean people's patriotism is manifested in the enthusiastic support from the rear to the front. The enemy uses barbaric, blind bombing and frantic invasion, inhuman crimes and trampling. These shameless methods cannot destroy the unity of the Korean people's rear and front lines. The Korean people have not only achieved great patriotic achievements in peaceful construction, but also achieved brilliant patriotic achievements in the support from the rear in the war. Under the call of General Kim Il-sung, all forces are directed towards the front. The front and the rear are fighting and producing like a giant.
　　The Korean people have inherited the patriotic traditions of their national heroes Eulji Mundeok, Gang Gam-chan, Yeon Gaesomun, and Yi Sun-sin. In the war against superior invaders, they mobilized the entire people, and used tactics such as clearing the fields and defending the city, avoiding protracted battles, and inducing surprise attacks, creating weapons, giving the enemy serious blows, safeguarding the honor of the motherland, and leaving an indelible example of patriotism for future generations. For example, from 1592 to 1598 AD, the superior forces of Japan invaded Korea, from Uiju in the northwest to Hoeryeong in the northeast. However, the heroes led by General Yi Sun-sin and the Korean people finally drove out the enemy in a long seven-year bloody battle. The glorious patriotic deeds of these national heroes inspire the 30 million Korean people who are fighting for their motherland today.
　　The Korean people are a consolidated and united single nation. She had undergone blood tests and training in the long anti-Japanese struggle. During the forty years of Japanese "rule" over Korea, the Korean people had never stopped the anti-Japanese struggle at home or abroad for a minute. The anti-Japanese armed struggle led by General Kim Il-sung guarded the honor of the motherland and the nation. He is a symbol of the fatherland and national honor of the Korean people.
　　(III)
　　The victory of the Great Russian October Socialist Revolution and the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution gave the Korean people the greatest internationalist lessons.
　　The Korean and Chinese people have a deep fighting friendship. Since the "May 30th" struggle in the Yanbian area of ​​Northeast China in the 1930s, the Korean and Chinese people have fought side by side with the enemy in many anti-Japanese mass struggles. During the Chinese People's Anti-Japanese War, the Korean people fought against the Japanese invaders together with the Chinese people in the Northeast and North China. Moreover, the Korean people participated in the Chinese People's Liberation War against the American imperialist aggression and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule. This is a brilliant example of the Korean people's patriotism and internationalism.
　　The Korean people have experienced and learned internationalism in their actual lives. Internationalism is true patriotism. The Korean people clearly know that the warm support of the world's people, headed by the Soviet people, and the brotherly assistance of the Chinese people are great conditions to guarantee victory. The strength of the world's peace and democracy camp has surpassed the imperialist camp. Imperialism is heading towards extinction, and its struggles are in vain. The people all over the world resolutely oppose war. The achievement of five hundred million signatures in the struggle to defend world peace demonstrates the firm will of the people all over the world to oppose war. In the struggle for lasting world peace, the Korean people understand what mission they should shoulder.
　　The American imperialists are the chief culprits who launched the aggressive war against Korea. The names of Truman, MacArthur, Acheson, and Dulles should be recorded on the list of war criminals and be justly tried by the people all over the world. They are the organizers of unprecedented barbaric atrocities in history. They destroyed international peace organizations. No amount of rhetoric can conceal their crimes.
　　History proves that those who fight for justice will win victory; those who wage unjust wars will eventually fail. Although the American aggressors mobilized the forces of their vassal states, and even mobilized all their forces in the East, they have been repeatedly defeated in the war against the young and small Korea. American imperialism is isolated. American imperialism is full of contradictions, and the imperialist camp is also full of contradictions.
　　American imperialism itself has strategic weaknesses. Its front is too long and too wide, its rear is far away, its "allies" are too weak, its forces are insufficient and scattered, and its soldiers do not know why they are fighting, so their morale is low. American imperialism is an enemy of the people all over the world. Its strategic weaknesses cannot be overcome. Although its firepower is strong, victory can never be achieved by firepower alone. Weapons must be made and operated by people.
　　Today, the patriotism of the Korean people has risen to an unprecedented level in history, and the final victory will surely belong to the Korean people.

　　朝鲜人民的爱国主义
    朝鲜中央通讯社驻华总分社社长金圣容
    （一）
    朝鲜人民一致地响应了金日成将军的号召“集中一切力量给敌人以决定性的打击，彻底干净地消灭我们土地上的外国武装侵略者及其走狗——李承晚卖国贼之流”，朝鲜人民广泛地武装起来为争取祖国解放战争的最后胜利而斗争。
    朝鲜战争是朝鲜人民争取民族独立和解放的战争，同时也是粉碎美国侵略亚洲破坏世界和平的神圣斗争。世界和平决不容帝国主义战争贩子们破坏，亚洲人民一定要争取独立、自由，朝鲜人民争取祖国解放的战争一定能得到胜利。
    美国侵略者疯狂的侵犯和他对朝鲜人民的最野蛮的犯罪行为，不仅没有也永远不能摧折朝鲜人民争取祖国解放的坚决意志，却使朝鲜人民的爱国主义更为高昂了。
    朝鲜人民具有崇高的爱国主义。朝鲜的爱国战争，完全具备必胜的条件。
    朝鲜人民长期地经历了日本帝国主义奴役统治及美帝国主义及其傀儡李承晚在南朝鲜统治的痛苦，我们深刻了解解放战争对于我们的意义。朝鲜人民英勇进行反侵略战争，不是由于任何暂时的因素，而是为了我们民族的基本利益。我们所进行的民族解放战争完全是正义的爱国的战争。
    朝鲜人民的祖国解放战争与东方各被压迫民族的解放战争有着相同的性质。东方民族解放运动是在帝国主义侵略下为争取民族独立和自由的长期的正义的斗争。这一斗争是争取世界持久和平、争取人民民主斗争中的重要一环。遍及全世界的保卫和平的斗争正在胜利地进行着。朝鲜人民目前正站在保卫世界和平斗争的最前列。
    朝鲜人民十分明确地认识到：为祖国的自由、独立和繁荣，为自己为千秋百代的子孙的幸福生活，只有一条道路——民族解放斗争的道路。历史曾一再地证明：为和平而斗争，为人民的利益而斗争的人们，终必获得胜利。苏联人民在反对外国侵略者的战争中取得了胜利，中国人民在反对日本帝国主义和美国支持的蒋介石匪帮的战争中取得了胜利，都证明上述历史的结论是正确的。
    （二）
    朝鲜人民有着英勇的人民军。他们来自人民并为人民而战。他们以祖国解放、民族繁荣的爱国主义武装着自己，以国际主义武装着自己，以先进的军事技术与战争经验武装着自己。他们具有金日成将军英雄的抗日战争的传统，优秀的政治领导和自觉的纪律。在这次抗击美国侵略者的战争中，无数次光辉的战绩和胜利，都证明了朝鲜人民军这优秀的品质。
    朝鲜人民军是英雄的军队，这种英雄性表现在解放汉城、大田和进攻抵达洛东江的战斗中，表现在无数次的渡江作战、海上作战、空中作战和高地争夺战中，也表现在敌军登陆仁川疯狂进犯时的月尾岛防卫战、汉城防卫战等为消灭敌人有生力量的英勇果敢防御战斗中。这些优秀的品质是战胜优势敌人的保障。朝鲜人民军不仅有成千成万的勇敢的战士，也有着优秀的指挥干部。正是这种结合起来的爱国主义和军事技术，使美国侵略者遭到许多次的失败。
    朝鲜人民军的力量在有组织的撤退过程中并没有像美国强盗所希望的那样削弱了减少了，恰恰相反，这支力量正在战斗中增加着并且巩固着。
    朝鲜人民有着勇敢的人民游击队。游击战争是民族解放运动中一个重要斗争方式。人民游击队的作用是巨大的，他们牵制敌人兵力，摧毁敌人的据点及交通线，扰乱敌人的作战计划，并使李承晚法西斯野蛮“统治”在广大地区内不能重建。朝鲜人民游击队有为民族的基本利益而战斗的爱国主义。他们继承着金日成将军抗日游击战争的传统，并有在过去的五年中同美李匪军作战的艰苦而宝贵的经验，在这次抗击美国侵略者的战争中，他们配合着人民军作战，更丰富了战斗的经验。现在他们的力量空前壮大起来了。
    在敌后作战的人民游击队，高举着朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的旗帜，已成为团结人民的爱国力量的中心。广大的朝鲜人民正在陆续地参加人民游击队和义勇军，直到三千万人民最后一个人为止，参军的行列是不会断的。这样，在伟大的民族解放斗争中，我们就有了这个斗争不可缺少的重要的人民武装力量。
    武装力量是民族解放运动胜利的一个基本条件。
    朝鲜人民是有组织的人民。她的三千万人民，包括工人、农人、青年、妇女、知识分子，所有的成年人，除下一小撮卖国贼李承晚集团外，都坚强地团结在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的旗帜下，团结在祖国战线的周围。朝鲜人民有着他们最亲爱的英明的领袖金日成将军和工人阶级的以马列主义武装自己的劳动党的领导。三千万朝鲜人民在争取民族解放的战争中巩固地团结起来了。朝鲜人民的力量是无穷无尽的。
    朝鲜人民成了自己国家的主人。朝鲜人民通过民主选举选出了自己的人民政权，我们的政权进行了伟大的各项民主改革并超额地提前完成经济建设计划，这许多民主主义的措施为共和国打下稳固的物质基础，这种人民政权是任何暴力所不能摧毁的。
    过去五年来，朝鲜人民的爱国主义怒涛般地成长着而且巩固着。四十年来的亡国奴生活深印在每一个朝鲜人民心里，他们每人都具有提高政治文化水平及增强自己国家力量的决心。五年来，朝鲜人民在建设自己的国家的工作里在伟大苏联的援助下获得巨大的成就。朝鲜人民是知道怎样决定并解决自己命运的民族。朝鲜人民在实际生活中体验到帝国主义和社会主义究竟那一个是敌人那一个是朋友。他们坚决反对正在走向灭亡的帝国主义而站在社会主义与民主阵营方面。
    朝鲜人民的爱国主义表现在后方对前方的热烈的支援上。敌人使用野蛮的盲目的滥炸和疯狂的侵犯，非人道的罪行和蹂躏，这些无耻的手段都破坏不了朝鲜人民的后方和前线的团结。朝鲜人民不仅在和平建设中取得伟大的爱国主义的成就，而且在战争中后方的支援里也取得光辉的爱国主义的成绩。在金日成将军的号召下，一切力量都向着前方，前方和后方像一个巨人似的战斗着生产着。
    朝鲜人民继承了她们的民族英雄乙支文德、姜邯赞、渊盖苏文和李舜臣的爱国主义的传统。他们在与优势的侵略者的战争中，动员全体人民，以清野守城、回避持久、诱导奇袭等作战方法，创造兵器，给敌人以严重的打击，维护祖国的荣誉，给后人留下了不可磨灭的爱国主义的范例。例如公元一五九二到一五九八年，日本的优势兵力曾侵略朝鲜，西北至义州东北至会宁，然而以李舜臣将军为首的英雄们和朝鲜人民终于在七年长期血战中驱逐了敌人。这些民族英雄的光辉的爱国主义事迹鼓舞着今天正在为祖国而战斗的三千万朝鲜人民。
    朝鲜人民是巩固团结的单一民族。她曾经在长久的抗日斗争中经受了血的考验和锻炼，日本“统治”朝鲜的四十年间，朝鲜人民无论在国内或在国外从未一分钟间断过抗日斗争。金日成将军领导的抗日武装斗争守护了祖国和民族的荣誉。他是朝鲜人民祖国和民族荣誉的象征。
    （三）
    俄国伟大的十月社会主义革命和中国人民革命的胜利给朝鲜人民以最大的国际主义教训。
    朝鲜人民和中国人民有着深厚的战斗的友谊，三十年代自东北延边地区“五·三○”斗争为始的许多次的抗日群众斗争，朝中两国人民都是并肩地同敌人战斗。中国人民抗日战争期间，朝鲜人民在东北及华北地区和中国人民一起打击日本侵略者。而且朝鲜人民参加了反对美帝国主义侵略及其走狗蒋介石反动统治的中国人民解放战争。这是朝鲜人民爱国主义与国际主义的辉煌的例证。
    朝鲜人民在实际的生活中体验了而且学习了国际主义。国际主义是真正的爱国主义。朝鲜人民明确地知道：以苏联人民为首的世界人民的热烈的声援和中国人民的兄弟般的援助，是保证获得胜利的伟大的条件。世界和平民主阵营的力量已超过了帝国主义阵营。帝国主义正在走向灭亡，它要挣扎，不过这些挣扎是徒然的。全世界人民坚决反对战争。保卫世界和平斗争争取五万万人签名的成绩表示了全世界人民反对战争的坚决意志。在争取世界持久和平斗争中，朝鲜人民明白应该担负的使命是什么。
    美国帝国主义者是发动侵略朝鲜战争的元凶。杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟、艾奇逊和杜勒斯之流的名字应该记在战犯名单上，受全世界人民正义的审判。他们是历史上空前的野蛮暴行的组织者。他们破坏了国际和平机构。任何花言巧语的狡辩都掩饰不了他们的罪行。
    历史证明：为正义而战的，获得胜利；进行非正义战争的，终将失败。美国侵略者虽然动员了它的附庸国的兵力，甚至动员了它在东方的全部兵力，然而在侵犯年青的小小的朝鲜的战争中，连续地遭受失败。美国帝国主义是孤立的。美帝国主义内部充满了矛盾，帝国主义阵营内部同样是充满了矛盾。
    美帝国主义本身存在着战略上的弱点。它的战线太长也太宽，它的后方很远，它的“同盟者”太弱，它的兵力很不足又分散，它的士兵不知为何而战因之士气低落。美帝国主义与全世界人民为敌，他的战略上的弱点是无法克服的，它的火力虽然强，但是胜利从来不能单靠火力取得，兵器是要人做的要人操用的。
    今天，朝鲜人民的爱国主义已高昂到历史上空前的地步，最后的胜利必属于朝鲜人民。
