　　The Bankrupt "Air Power Decisive" Theory
    Pan Fei
    Is Air Force "Omnipotent"?
    When American imperialism boasts about its military strength, it particularly likes to tout the power of its air force. There is also an unspoken reason for this: the weakness of the American army is already well-known; it wrote its inglorious history in World War II.
    Thus, the air force is portrayed as a monster, a force that determines the outcome of wars. Simple-minded American warlords are also confident that the air force can help them conquer the world and avoid destruction.
    Exaggerating the power of the air force and unilaterally developing air force units has become an important part of Wall Street's plan to enslave the people of the world. When the Korean War broke out, the total strength of the U.S. military was 1.37 million, of which 350,000 were air force personnel.
    American imperialism's atomic blackmail is also based on the idea of "air power decisive." U.S. Air Force Secretary Symington said that U.S. bases in Europe and elsewhere are unreliable. The hope of winning the war rests solely on the air force. Because the B-39 bomber can fly to the Soviet Union with atomic bombs. To prove that it alone had powerful military force, the U.S. Air Force specially sank an aircraft carrier worth $20 million in an exercise.
    In fact, the theories of Symington and his ilk are nothing new. The Italian Douhet advocated the fallacy of "air power conquers all" before World War II. During World War II, Hitler and Goering were both enthusiastic advocates of Douhetism. They used a large number of aircraft and paratroopers to "blitz" Crete Island, annihilating the incompetent British army. This "masterpiece" of German fascism was inexplicably admired by military scientists from various capitalist countries headed by the United States. They worshiped a creed: "The mastery of air supremacy is victory!"
    Facts as Proof
    Can the air force really determine the outcome of a war? History is the best witness.
    The basis of the "air power decisive" theory lies in the following two points: first, it is believed that large-scale air force bombing can completely destroy the enemy's will to fight and make them completely lose their combat effectiveness; second, it uses large-scale bombing to destroy the enemy country's economy, depriving the other side of the material basis to continue fighting.
    The Soviet-German War, which began in June 1941, opened with large-scale air combat. At dawn on June 22, four thousand aircraft under Goering's command broke into the western part of the Soviet Union. Since the beginning of the war, German fascism had air superiority for a considerable period. The then German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop complacently asserted: "In the century of motorcycles, tanks, and dive bombers, there will be no riots in territories where residents have been disarmed." But facts taught Ribbentrop: The Soviet people resisted the enemy with confidence and without fear—whether on the front lines or in the occupied areas—and finally buried German fascism. The bombing by the German air force also did not "destroy" the Soviet economy. From 1942 to 1944, the production of various industrial sectors in the Soviet Union increased by an average of 40 percent. Soviet workers dedicated a large number of airplanes and tanks to the country and finally managed to greatly overwhelm the enemy in this regard.
    The fragile "air power decisive" theory was not only exposed by the Soviet Union in the Soviet-German War, but also exposed by German fascism itself. After the end of the North African campaign in 1943, the United States and Britain organized large-scale bombing of Germany, attempting to force Hitler to surrender. During this year, a total of 1.35 million tons of bombs were dropped on Germany, the effect of which, according to the official U.S. "Strategic Bombing Survey," only resulted in a loss of 9 percent of Germany's total industrial production. Berlin was subjected to more than a hundred bombings by the U.S. and British air forces in the last two years of the war, but the city's munitions factories kept their engines running. The military failure of Germany was ultimately due to the fatal blow it received from the Soviet Red Army on land. From the beginning to the end of the war, the entire process could not overturn this proposition. On February 27, 1945, when the Soviet Red Army had advanced to within fifty miles of Berlin, the United States thought it had an "opportunity" and dispatched 2,000 aircraft for daylight bombing to promote Germany's surrender. But Hitler relied on 500,000 elite troops gathered in the Berlin area to resist desperately. The Berlin campaign was won by the heroic attacks of the Soviet army and the coordinated operations of various arms of the military. In this campaign, the Soviet Union deployed 22,000 artillery pieces, 4,000 tanks, and 5,000 aircraft.
    The Far Eastern battlefield in World War II once again proved the bankruptcy of the "air power decisive" theory. Japan surrendered because the Chinese people's eight-year war of resistance consumed a large amount of its manpower and material resources. Finally, the Soviet Union sent troops to Northeast China and annihilated hundreds of thousands of elite troops of the Kwantung Army, which finally defeated Japanese imperialism. Chennault, the American air pirate who made his fortune by relying on the air force, also confessed that atomic bombs and American air raids would not make Japan surrender. He had to admit: "The Soviet Union's war against Japan was the decisive factor in accelerating the end of the Far Eastern War. Even if the atomic bomb had not been used, it would have had the same effect. The blow the Red Army gave to Japan completed the encirclement of Japan, resulting in Japan's surrender."
    The Sorrow of American Generals
    The revived Douhetism of American imperialism only exposes the decline of bourgeois military theory. Their slogan of "one weapon decides the outcome" only proves their military ignorance and incompetence.
    The essence of the "air power decisive" theory is the theory of weapons as all-powerful. The theory of weapons as all-powerful is a military theory that has long been bankrupt. It has been repeatedly exposed, pierced, and buried by the Soviet Union's Patriotic War, the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Liberation War.
    Comrade Stalin believed that what guarantees victory is high morale (which is related to the nature of the war), a solid rear (imperialism cannot have a solid rear), the economic power of the country, and a large number of excellent divisions... and other factors. Marxist-Leninist military science never regards one arm of the military as isolated from another, let alone isolating the role of people from the role of things. The metaphysical viewpoint of bourgeois military scholars, however, intentionally or unintentionally exaggerates the role of things and obliterates the role of people. They also cannot solve the problem of coordinated actions of various arms of the military in war.
    So, why do the American imperialist adventurers exaggerate the role of things and obliterate the role of people? The reason is very simple: they can manufacture weapons, but they cannot manufacture—to put it more accurately, they cannot control people's thoughts. The newspapers in New York and Washington chatter endlessly about atomic bombs, B-39s, long-range bombing, flying arrows..., but no one ever talks about American soldiers—thinking people. The war profiteers have unanimously made a rule: do not talk about soldiers! American generals are unwilling to talk about soldiers because American soldiers are the most unreliable element in their armed forces. The most ideal war is: all operations are done by machines, using radio to control airplanes, tanks, and rockets. Since this is impossible, then the proportion of people must be reduced to a minimum. Among the various arms of the military, only the air force can meet this requirement. The "air power decisive" theory arises from this basis. However, even the air force cannot but show the role of people in war. In the last three years of World War II, German fascism manufactured 80,000 airplanes, of which 75,000 were shot down by Stalin's eagles—the invincible Soviet air force.
    The history of war tells us: it is people who play a leading role in war! The tragedy of the "air power decisive" theory lies here.

　　破产了的“空军制胜”论
    潘非
    空军“万能”乎？
    美帝国主义在炫耀自己的武力时，特别喜欢吹嘘空军力量。这里面也有它难言的苦衷：美国陆军的孱弱，已人所共知；在第二次世界大战中，它写下了自己的不光彩的历史。
    于是，空军便被描绘成一种怪物，一个决定战争胜负的力量。头脑简单的美国军阀们，也自信空军可以帮助他们征服世界，免于毁灭。
    夸大宣传空军的威力与片面发展空军部队，便成为华尔街奴役世界人民方案中的一个重要部分。在侵朝战争爆发时，美国三军兵力总计一百三十七万人，其中空军人员达三十五万。
    美帝国主义的原子讹诈，也是建立在“空军制胜”论这一观念上的。美国空军部长薛明顿说，美国在欧洲和其他各地的基地，都靠不住。取得战争胜利的希望，只有寄托在空军身上。因为Ｂ——三九型的轰炸机，可以带着原子弹飞往苏联。美国空军为了证明只有它自己才有强大的武力，特地在演习中炸沉了一艘价值二万万美元的航空母舰。
    其实薛明顿之流的理论，没有半点儿新的东西。意大利的杜黑，在第二次世界大战以前，即首倡“空军征服一切”的谬论。第二次世界大战时，希特勒、戈林都是杜黑主义的热心倡导者。他们应用了大批飞机，携带伞兵，“闪击”了克里特岛，歼灭了无能的英军。德国法西斯的这一“杰作”，曾为美国为首的各国资产阶级的军事学家所莫明其妙地赞叹过。他们崇拜这样一个信条：“制空权的掌握就是胜利！”
    事实作证
    空军真能决定战争的胜负吗？历史是最好的见证。
    “空军制胜”论的根据，立足于这样两个观点：第一，认为大规模空军的轰炸，可以彻底摧毁敌方的战斗意志，使其完全丧失战斗力；第二，以大规模的轰炸来毁灭敌国的经济，使对方失去继续进行作战的物质基础。
    一九四一年六月开始的苏德战争，是以大规模的空战揭幕的。六月二十二日拂晓，戈林指挥下的四千架飞机，闯进了苏联的西方。自战争开始以后，在相当长的一个时期内，德国法西斯掌握着空中的优势。当时的德国外交部长里宾特洛甫得意地断言：“在摩托、坦克和俯冲轰炸机的世纪里，在居民已被解除武装的领土上，是没有暴动的。”但事实教训了里宾特洛甫：苏联人民满怀信心、毫不怯弱地抗击着敌人——不论在前线或沦陷区，并最后终于埋葬了德国法西斯。德国空军的轰炸，也没有使苏联经济“毁灭”。从一九四二年到一九四四年，苏联各种工业部门的生产，平均增加了百分之四十。苏联工人向国家献出大量的飞机和坦克，并且最后争取到在这方面大大地压倒了敌人。
    脆弱的“空军制胜”论，不但在苏德战争中为苏联所戳破，而且也被德国法西斯自己所戳破。在一九四三年北非战役结束以后，美英对德国本土组织了大规模的轰炸，企图使希特勒屈服。在这一年中，投在德国本土的炸弹，共达一百三十五万吨，其效果根据美国官方公布的“战略轰炸调查”，也只不过使德国的工业总生产量损失了百分之九。柏林在大战的最后两年中，曾遭受了美英空军百次以上的轰炸，但该市的军火工厂，始终开动着马达。德国军事上的失败，归根到底，是因为在陆地上受到了苏联红军致命的打击。从战争开始到最后结束，全部过程都无法推翻这一命题。一九四五年二月二十七日，当苏联红军已经进距柏林五十英里时，美国以为“有机可乘”，出动了二千架飞机进行白昼轰炸，促使德国投降。但希特勒凭借着柏林地区集结着五十万精锐，拼死抵抗。柏林大会战是以苏军的英勇攻击以及各兵种的协同作战取得胜利的，在这一战役中，苏联出动二万二千门大炮，四千辆坦克，五千架飞机。
    二次大战中的远东战场，又一次证明了“空军制胜”论的破产。日本投降，是因为中国人民的八年抗战，消耗了它大量的人力物力，最后苏联出兵东北，全歼关东军数十万精锐之师，得以最后击败了日本帝国主义。靠空军发家致富的美国空中强盗陈纳德，也自供原子弹和美国空袭，不会使日本投降。他不得不承认：“苏联对日战争，是加速远东战争结束的决定因素。即使原子弹未曾使用，也同样会发生作用的。红军对日本所给的打击，完成了对日本的包围，结果引起了日本屈膝。”
    美国将军的悲哀
    美帝国主义复活了的杜黑主义，只是暴露了资产阶级军事学说的没落。他们所倡导的“一种武器决胜负”的口号，只是证明其军事上的无知与无能。
    “空军制胜”论的本质，就是唯武器论。唯武器论是早已破产了的军事理论，它一再被苏联的卫国战争，中国人民的抗日战争与解放战争所戳破与埋葬。
    斯大林同志认为保证取得胜利的，是高昂的士气（这与战争的性质有关），巩固的后方（帝国主义不可能有巩固的后方），国家的经济威力，大量与优秀的师团……等因素。马列主义的军事科学，从不把这一兵种与那一兵种孤立起来看待，更不能把人的作用与物的作用孤立起来看待。资产阶级军事学者的形而上学观点，却有意或无意地夸大了物的作用，抹杀了人的作用。他们也不能解决各个兵种在战争中的协同动作问题。
    那么，美帝国主义的冒险家们，为什么要夸大物的作用，抹杀人的作用呢？原因很简单：他们能够制造武器，但不能制造——说的更确切一些，是不能控制人的思想。纽约和华盛顿的报纸，喋喋不休地议论着原子弹、Ｂ——３９，远距离轰炸、飞箭……，但从没有人谈到过美国士兵——有思想的人。战争贩子们不约而同地订下了一个规约：莫谈士兵！美国将军们不愿谈到士兵，因为美国士兵是他们武装力量中最不可靠的因素。最理想的战争是：作战的全都是机器，用无线电来操纵飞机、坦克、火箭。这一点既不可能，那么只有把人的比重减少到最低限度。在各兵种中，唯有空军，才能适合这个要求。“空军制胜”论就是从这一基础上产生的。然而，就是空军，也不能不显示出人在战争中的作用。德国法西斯在第二次世界大战的最后三年中，曾制造了八万架飞机，其中就有七万五千架被斯大林之鹰——无敌的苏联空军所击落。
    战争的历史告诉我们：在战争中起主导作用的，是人！“空军制胜”论的悲哀就在这里。
