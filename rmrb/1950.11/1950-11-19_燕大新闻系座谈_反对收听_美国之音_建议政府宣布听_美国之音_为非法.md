Yanjing University News Department Holds Forum
    Opposing Listening to "Voice of America"
    Suggesting the Government Declare Listening to "Voice of America" Illegal
    [Our Newspaper] The News Department of Yanjing University held a department-wide discussion on the 17th, titled: "Should We Listen to the Voice of America?" Participants included Mr. Jiang Yinen, head of the News Department, Mr. Zhang Longdong, Mr. Zheng Linzhuang, head of the Economics Department, Mr. Chen Hongshun, head of the Library, and some students from other departments, totaling more than 200 people.
    First, the discussion focused on the nature of the "Voice of America."
    Student Hong Yilong pointed out: American broadcasting is controlled by Wall Street bosses, serving the interests of capitalists. The "Voice of America" is a propaganda tool directly under the control of the State Department. An American senator once suggested using the "Voice of America" as a tool to promote a "Marshall Plan in the ideological field." It is an imperialist tool of aggression, a loudspeaker for American imperialist warmongering. Its purposes of deception, fabrication, and intimidation are to numb the Chinese people and the people of the world.
    Secondly, the discussion focused on the role of the "Voice of America."
    Mr. Zhang Longdong mentioned that during World War II, Goebbels, the propaganda minister of Hitler's Germany, constantly broadcast "No invasion of France!" for seven months before invading France, using soft persuasion and hard intimidation to paralyze the French people. As a result, Germany invaded France and occupied it within a month. Mr. Jiang Yinen pointed out: "The Voice of America" is now trying to disintegrate our anti-American ideology. Student Niu You said: After the American troops landed in Incheon, the "Voice of America" broadcast: "American troops will not cross the 38th parallel"; later, after crossing the 38th parallel, it broadcast: "American troops will not cross the so-called 'MacArthur Line' from Sinŭiju to Hamhung," but later they did; it also said: a buffer zone would be left on the Sino-Korean border, and American troops would not enter the Chinese border, but later it refused to recognize the Yalu River as the Sino-Korean border. The purpose of this series of deceptive propaganda is to paralyze the vigilance of the Chinese people. Some students pointed out that after the American troops landed in Incheon, there was a saying in our school that "American troops will not cross the 38th parallel." Imperialists are using the "Voice of America" as an ideological weapon to coordinate with military offensives. Not long ago, Truman requested Congress to allocate an additional $89 million for propaganda expenses, mainly to be used for the "Voice of America" broadcasts. Student Shi Youshan also said: We must understand that the people of the world and imperialism are irreconcilable. The reason why the United States spends a lot of money on the "Voice of America" is precisely because it can play a considerable destructive role among the people of the world. Many of the rumors spread among the Chinese people come from the "Voice of America."
    Next, the discussion turned to whether one could listen to the "Voice of America" with a critical attitude.
    Mr. Zhang Longdong said: The "Voice of America" is directly under the control of the U.S. State Department. The U.S. State Department employs more than 300 Kuomintang members to carry out so-called "psychological warfare" against China in a planned and systematic way. The "Voice of America" not only insults the Chinese people, but sometimes also superficially flatters the Chinese people, using soft persuasion and hard intimidation, which is not something that ordinary intellectuals and citizens with low political awareness can criticize. Student Li Yuxing said: "The Voice of America" has no correct news at all. For example, the "Voice of America" broadcast "Communist troops invaded Tibet," is this a fact? The fact is that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is advancing to liberate Tibet. Student Wu Yuning also said: The measure of so-called true and false news has different interpretations from different standpoints, and it depends on the whole issue. For example, it is a fact that American imperialism aided Chiang Kai-shek, but they said that aiding Chiang Kai-shek was to help the Chinese people "prevent communism," but in essence, it was aiding Chiang Kai-shek to slaughter the Chinese people and obstruct the liberation of the Chinese people. Wang Enshan said: Listening to the "Voice of America" is like smoking opium, and you will become addicted to it if you smoke too much. Su Zhizhong said: If you know it is harmful but still want to listen to it, it is like Americans giving us poison, and we know it is poison but still want to taste it. We ban the cultivation of opium, ban the sale of opium, and also ban the smoking of opium.
    Later, it was discussed whether listening to the "Voice of America" should be prohibited.
    First of all, everyone realized that prohibiting listening to the "Voice of America" is precisely to protect freedom of the press. The Common Program stipulates: "Protect the freedom to report true news. It is forbidden to use news to carry out defamation, damage the interests of the country and the people, and incite world war." Student Hong Yisheng said: Our prohibition of listening to the "Voice of America" is in the interest of the vast majority of the people. If we do not protect the interests of the people, it is a cruel act against the people. Student Ma Qingjian said: We advocate prohibiting listening to the "Voice of America," but prohibition is only one aspect, and the other aspect is persuasion and education. For example, we want to forbid children from playing with fire, but the main thing is to tell them that playing with fire will cause trouble. Therefore, laws should be combined with publicity and education.
    Finally, everyone believed that the "Voice of America" is a tool for American imperialists to poison the Chinese people, and listening to the "Voice of America" is also the most wrong and harmful behavior. We must call on all teachers, students, staff, and workers of the school, as well as the people of the whole city and the whole country, to stand up against listening to the "Voice of America," and at the same time, we must suggest that the government declare: "Listening to the 'Voice of America' is illegal."

### 燕大新闻系座谈  反对收听“美国之音”  建议政府宣布听“美国之音”为非法

　　燕大新闻系座谈
    反对收听“美国之音”
    建议政府宣布听“美国之音”为非法
    【本报讯】燕京大学新闻系在十七日举行了一个全系讨论会，题目是：“要不要听美国之音？”参加讨论的有新闻系主任蒋荫恩先生和张隆栋先生，经济系主任郑林庄和图书馆主任陈鸿舜先生以及外系一些同学，共二百多人。
    首先讨论了“美国之音”是怎样一种性质的东西？
    洪一龙同学指出：美国广播事业都是统制在华尔街大老板手里的，是服务于资本家利益的。而美国之音更是直属于国务院的御用宣传机关。美国曾有一个参议员建议以“美国之音”作为推行“思想领域上的马歇尔计划”的工具。它正是一个帝国主义的侵略工具，是美帝鼓动战争的喇叭筒。欺骗，造谣，恐吓，目的无非是麻痹中国人民和全世界人民。
    其次讨论到“美国之音”的作用怎样？
    张隆栋先生谈到二次大战时，希特勒德国的宣传部长戈培尔在侵略法国前七个月就在不断广播说：“不侵法！”软骗，硬吓，以麻醉法国人民。结果德国侵略了法国，并且在一个月内就占领了法国。蒋荫恩先生指出：“美国之音”现在正是要瓦解我们抗美的思想。钮友?同学说：美军在仁川登陆后，“美国之音”广播说：“美军不过三八线”；后来过了三八线，它又广播说：“美军不过新义州到咸兴的所谓“麦克阿瑟线”，可是后来又过了；它还说：在中朝边境留一个缓冲地带，美军不进到中国的边境，可是到后来他还要不承认鸭绿江是中朝的边界，这一连串欺骗宣传的目的，正是要麻痹我们中国人民的警觉性。有的同学指出美军在仁川登陆后，我们学校里就曾有这样一种“美军不会过三八线”的说法。帝国主义者是将“美国之音”作为思想武器来配合军事进攻的。不久前，杜鲁门请求国会额外拨款八千九百万美元作为宣传费用，主要就是用在“美国之音”的广播上。石幼珊同学也说：我们要了解全世界人民和帝国主义是势不两立的。美帝所以要以大量经费办“美国之音”，正因为它能够在世界人民中间起相当大的破坏作用。传播在中国人民中间的谣言，就有许多是“美国之音”传出来的。
    接着讨论到是否可以用批判的态度收听“美国之音”？
    张隆栋先生说：“美国之音”是直属于美国国务院的。美国国务院用了三百多个国民党人，有计划、有系统地对中国进行所谓“心理作战”。“美国之音”不仅要侮辱中国人民，而且有时也表面上恭维中国人，软骗硬吓，不是一般政治觉悟不高的知识分子和市民有能力去批判它的。李禹兴同学说：“美国之音”根本就没有正确的消息，譬如说：“美国之音”广播“中共军入侵西藏”，这是事实吗？事实是中国人民解放军为解放西藏而进军。伍愉凝同学也说：所谓消息真假的衡量，在不同的立场有不同的解释，而且要看整个的问题。譬如说美帝援蒋是事实，但他们说援蒋是帮助中国人民“以防止共产主义”，实质上是它援蒋屠杀中国人民，阻挠中国人民的解放。王恩善说：听“美国之音”好比吸鸦片，多吸鸦片就会上瘾。苏志中说：假如你知道它有害却还要听的话，那正如美国人给我们毒药，我们知道是毒药却还要尝尝看。我们禁种鸦片，禁卖鸦片，也要禁吸鸦片。
    后来谈到是否应禁听“美国之音”？
    首先大家认识到：禁听“美国之音”正是为了保护新闻自由。共同纲领就这样规定：“保护报道真实新闻的自由。禁止利用新闻以进行诽谤，破坏国家人民的利益和煽动世界战争。”洪一声同学说：我们禁听“美国之音”是对最大多数人民有利的，我们不保护人民的利益，就是对人民残酷的行为。马清健同学说：我们主张禁听“美国之音”，但禁听只不过是一方面，另一方面是说服教育。譬如我们要禁止小孩子玩火，但主要的是要告诉他玩火是要闯祸的。因此，法令应和宣传教育结合起来。
    最后，大家认为“美国之音”是美帝毒害中国人民的工具，听“美国之音”也是最错误、最有害的行为，我们要号召全校师生员工以及全市全国的人民都起来反对听“美国之音”，同时还要建议政府宣布：“听‘美国之音’是非法的。”
