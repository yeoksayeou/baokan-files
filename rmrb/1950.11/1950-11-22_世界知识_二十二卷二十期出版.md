"World Knowledge"
Volume 22, Issue 20 Published

The international affairs weekly "World Knowledge," Volume 22, Issue 20, was published on the 18th of this month. This issue features an editorial entitled "Salute to the Heroes and Warriors Defending the Motherland's Borders and Resisting America and Aiding Korea!" The editorial first denounces the shameless slander by American imperialism that our volunteer army's aid to Korea is "aggression" and "interference." It then exposes the American imperialists' aggressive actions and conspiracies carried out under the guise of the fake United Nations. The editorial concludes by pointing out that the heroes and warriors who volunteer to resist America and aid Korea are concrete representatives of great patriotism and internationalism, and are exemplary figures who have highly promoted patriotism and internationalism among the people. Let the imperialists slander and tremble! The Chinese and Korean people, fighting side by side against a common enemy, will surely win the final common victory! This issue's special articles include Fu Ying's "Resisting America and Aiding Korea Will Surely Be Victorious!" and Hu Qi's "American Imperialism is a Paper Tiger," as well as Deng Chao's "The Bankrupt Strategic Thinking of American Imperialism." The analysis of the strategic, tactical, and other weaknesses of American imperialism is quite detailed. There are also several current affairs cartoons by famous artists such as Zheng Wei, Ding Cong, and Liu Xun. After reading the articles and looking at the cartoons, people can draw a conclusion: the seemingly ferocious American imperialism is indeed a paper tiger. This issue also publishes an article by Mr. Yu Jieqiong, who returned from the United States, entitled "What I Saw of American Life." This article is based on Mr. Yu's personal experiences and observations in the United States, and it is of great help to us in understanding the essence of the so-called "American way of life."

　　“世界知识”
     二十二卷二十期出版
    国际问题周刊“世界知识”第二十二卷第二十期已于本月十八日出版。这一期以“向保卫祖国边疆和抗美援朝的英雄们，勇士们致敬！”为题发表社评，社评首先痛斥美帝国主义无耻的诬指我志愿军的援朝是“侵略”、“干涉”，接着又揭露美帝在假联合国之名义而进行的侵略行动和阴谋。社评最后指出：志愿参加抗美援朝的英雄们和勇士们，是伟大的爱国主义和国际主义的具体化的代表，是人民群众中高度发扬了爱国主义和国际主义的典范人物。让帝国主义者去污蔑，去发抖吧！中朝人民为反对共同的敌人而并肩作战是一定能争取最后的共同的胜利的！本期专论有福英的“抗美援朝必胜！”和胡骑的“美帝国主义外强中干”、邓超的“美帝破产了的战略思想”等三篇。对美帝战略上、战术上及各方面弱点的分析颇为详细。并有正威、丁聪、刘迅诸名画家时事漫画多幅，读了文章、看了漫画，人们可以得出一个结论：状似凶猛的美帝，的确是一个纸老虎。本期并刊载了由美返国人士余捷琼先生的一篇“我所看到的美国生活”，此文系余先生在美身历目睹的实事，对我们认识所谓“美国生活方式”的实质，确有很大帮助。
