Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 17th. The Czechoslovak Communist Party's organ, *Red Right*, published a special article on the 14th entitled "Another Blow to the Warmongers by China," commenting on China's refusal to participate in the discussion of the one-sided report made by MacArthur, the illegal commander of the imperialist intervention in Korea, saying that it was "a bucket of cold water poured on the feverish heads of the American and British aggressors." The article continued: "The masters of Wall Street and their servants thought they could summon the representatives of the 475 million Chinese people as imperialists in the colonies summon their slaves. The American imperialists know very well that attacking Korea is attacking China. But now, the American aggressors want to hide behind new lies and accuse the Chinese government of 'interfering in Korea' with MacArthur's fabricated 'report'. The refusal of the Chinese people has dispelled these futile hopes of American imperialism."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 17th. The German Socialist Unity Party's organ, *Neues Deutschland*, in its editorial on the 15th, called Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's reply to the United Nations refusing to participate in the discussion of MacArthur's so-called report "an indictment against the American butchers and warmongers." The editorial pointed out: "This reply has received the strongest response throughout the world, especially among the people of Asian countries. The German people—for whom the United States intends to prepare a fate like that of Korea—stand wholeheartedly on the side of the great People's Republic of China and the bravely fighting Korean people."

　　捷克德国两报评论：
    我拒绝参加讨论麦魔报告是对战争贩子的又一打击
    【新华社布拉格十七日电】捷克斯洛伐克共产党机关报红色权利报，于十四日发表题为“中国对战争贩子的另一次打击”的专文，评论我国拒绝参加讨论帝国主义干涉朝鲜的非法司令——麦克阿瑟所作的片面报告说：这是对美英侵略者热昏的头上浇了一盆冷水。该文继称：华尔街的主子以及他们的奴仆们，以为他们能够像在殖民地的帝国主义者召唤他们的奴隶那样召唤四亿七千五百万中国人民的代表。美帝国主义者明知道进攻朝鲜就是进攻中国。可是现在，美国侵略者想要躲在新的谎言后面，以麦克阿瑟捏造的“报告”来控告中国政府“干涉朝鲜”。中国人民的拒绝，已打消了美帝国主义这些徒然的希望。
    【新华社布拉格十七日电】德国统一社会党机关报新德意志报于十五日社论中把周恩来外长致联合国的拒绝参加讨论麦克阿瑟的所谓报告的复文称作是“控告美国屠夫与战争贩子的起诉状”。社论指出：“这一复文在全世界，特别是亚洲各国人民中得到最有力的响应。德国人民——美国是想为他们准备下和朝鲜一样的命运的——全心全意地站在伟大的中华人民共和国和英勇奋战的朝鲜人民这一边。”
