Xinhua News Agency, 29th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, Korean People's Guerrilla Units are attacking enemy troop concentrations and supply lines everywhere in areas occupied by the U.S.-Syngman Rhee bandit troops, thwarting the enemy's operational plans. A powerful mobile unit of the People's Guerrilla Units operating in the Taebaek Mountains area on the east coast of Korea recently attacked an enemy regiment concentrating in the Geochang area of South Gyeongsang Province. Suffering a heavy blow, the enemy abandoned a large amount of military supplies and fled towards Hapcheon.

The Kim Mun-geol unit of the People's Guerrilla Units operating along the 38th parallel, in the week since October 29th, has continuously and systematically attacked enemy supply bases in the triangular area between Cheorwon, Godeok (Gangwon Province), and Cheongsong (North Gyeongsang Province). This series of attacks directly threatens the enemy's main supply base at Wonsan Port and closely links the guerrilla units in the Sobaeksan Mountains area south of the 38th parallel.

Two People's Guerrilla Units in the southwest area of Cheongsong have continued to operate in the area of the 38th parallel on the east coast and parts of Hwanghae Province and South Pyongan Province since the 5th.

    【新华社二十九日讯】据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：朝鲜人民游击队在美李匪军侵占地区，到处袭击敌军的兵力集中地带和补给线，挫败敌军的作战计划。在朝鲜东海岸太白山地区活动的人民游击队的强大机动部队，最近在庆尚南道的居昌地区袭击正在集中的敌军一个团。遭受沉重打击的敌人丢弃大量军需器材，向陕川方面逃走。
    在沿三八线地区活动的金文杰部游击队，自十月二十九日起的一周中，连续有组织地袭击在铁原、库底（江原道）和青松（庆尚北道）之间三角地带的敌军补给基地。这一系列的出击直接威胁敌人的主要补给基地元山港，并紧密地联系了三八线以南小白山地区的游击队。
    在青松西南地区的两支人民游击队，自五日起在东海岸方面三八线一带，和黄海道、平安南道一部地区继续活动。
