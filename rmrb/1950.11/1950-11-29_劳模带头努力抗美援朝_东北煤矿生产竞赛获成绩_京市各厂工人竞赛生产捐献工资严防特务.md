　　Model Workers Take the Lead in Working Hard to Resist America and Aid Korea
    Northeast Coal Mines Achieve Success in Production Competitions
    Workers in Beijing Factories Compete in Production, Donate Wages, and Strictly Guard Against Special Agents
    [Report from this newspaper] An patriotic production competition has been universally launched in all mining areas of Northeast China, and initial achievements have been made. According to statistics from seven mining areas under the Northeast Coal Mine Administration Bureau: the output in the first week of November increased by 43 percent compared to the first week of October. The quality has also generally improved. Encouraged by a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, employees have consciously strengthened labor discipline, with the attendance rate reaching over 92 percent in the past week. Accidents continue to decrease. The rapid development of the competition in various mines is due to the education on current events for employees, especially the active leadership of the model workers who attended the National Model Workers Representative Conference, which inspired the patriotic enthusiasm of the vast number of employees. For example, model workers such as Zhang Zifu, Shi Yuhai, and Li Qingxuan, after returning from the meeting in Beijing, immediately went to various mining areas to give lectures, calling on employees to resist American imperialist aggression and carry out patriotic production competitions. Model employees and advanced groups responded enthusiastically. Secondly, after the competition was launched, trade union cadres went deep into the grassroots level to provide specific assistance, so that the competition movement was carried out under leadership. More than 65 percent of the trade union cadres in all mining areas of Northeast China went to the grassroots trade unions in mines and pits to help with their work. Cadres above the ministerial level of the Northeast Coal Mine General Trade Union led four groups to Fushun, Jixi, Xi'an and other places to conduct in-depth leadership and learn from experience. Thirdly, the close cooperation of the Party, the administration, and the trade union is also one of the reasons for the rapid development of the competition movement.
    However, according to the inspection of the competition movement in various mining areas by the Northeast Committee of the Coal Mine Trade Union, the following shortcomings and deviations have been discovered and urgently need to be corrected: (1) The scope of the movement is not broad enough, and most staff, technicians, health personnel, etc. have not yet been involved in the competition movement. (2) Some mining areas have begun to find a deviation towards "shock work," focusing solely on output without strictly implementing safety technical regulations. Some do not pay attention to improving technology and working methods, simply increasing labor intensity, making employees too tired.

    [Report from this newspaper] The broad masses of workers in the capital are resisting America and aiding Korea with various voluntary actions. First of all, they launched a patriotic production competition, and new records of labor productivity and product quality have been constantly emerging. In the No. 3 group of lathe operators at the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, female worker Tu Wang Yunhui has created a new record of 283 wheels per day, exceeding the original target (120) by 150 percent. Wang Yunpeng in the forging workshop makes cotter pins; the original target was 700 per day, now exceeding the target by 114 percent, making 1,500 per day. Meng Zhaolian in the foundry workshop makes gears, increasing from the original target of 10 per day to 46, exceeding the target by 360 percent. Employees in the third group of that workshop declared: "The more frantically American imperialism invades, the more tightly we unite." The specific items of the competition in the Public Bus Company are "on time, eliminate breakdowns, save fuel materials, no rework"; now the repair shop has overfulfilled the vehicle repair plan by 118 percent, and has initially overcome the phenomenon of rework, which has been reduced from nine reworked vehicles in September to one. Employees of the Qinghe Woolen Mill have successfully completed the production task of 100,000 yards of woolen cloth, and many production and conservation models have emerged. Now they have received a large number of orders, and the workshop groups are formulating plans to strive to complete the tasks quickly. In the newly built brick factory, the loss rate of bricks used to be as high as 5 percent, but now there are no waste products at all. In the past, two machines produced a total of 90,000 brick blanks per day, now they can produce 94,000. The private Yongfeng Chemical Factory specializes in making calcium carbonate. The output in October exceeded the plan by 50 percent. This month, the untimely supply of some materials has affected production, but the daily production rate still exceeds the predetermined quota.
    In order to strictly prevent the sabotage of hidden enemies and do a good job in preventing special agents, fire, air raids, and theft, the workers of each factory are actively strengthening their defense forces, improving organizations, and establishing strict defense systems. The Waterworks Company implements "key protection" with emphasis, and combines the safety work in machinery and technology with the defense work, in order to achieve safe production and safe water supply. The employees of the Telecommunications Bureau resolutely stated that they would ensure smooth communication and eliminate errors, and carry out the defense work of keeping state secrets. Each unit has formulated very specific and practical systems in combination with its own business nature, and strictly implemented them.
    [Another News Item] Li Jinquan, a national model worker representative from the electrical welding group of the forging and welding workshop of the repair department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, proposed ten guarantee conditions to challenge the electric welders of all public and private factories in North China. At the same time, the whole factory launched a competition between groups and shifts. Qu Dashan and others did the drilling work for the iron trough of the blast furnace. The day shift drilled 422 holes in half a day, and the night shift drilled 720 holes. The boiler room group worked especially hard, completing the work of 35 workdays in 16 workdays. When Chen Zhang Wang Fuling's group in the crane yard rushed to repair a blast furnace material tank, the work that used to take eight hours was now completed in five and a half hours. All workers of Class A in the No. 1, 2, and 3 boiler rooms of the Ironmaking Department donated one day's wages to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, and proposed guarantee conditions such as strengthening unity, no accidents, and strictly preventing special agents. The next day, the workers of Class A of the blast furnace and the stone crusher also responded, some donating one day's wages and some donating two days' wages, and all the workers expressed their determination to resolutely complete and strive to exceed the task.
    All the employees of the repair stock of the foundry department proposed to guarantee to increase the output by more than 8 percent on the existing basis. The output of the cast pipe yard has now exceeded this standard. The finished product rate of the sand casting yard still maintains a record of 100 percent. All the employees of the Power Department expressed their strong confidence and continued to maintain safe operation. The water supply workers of the Water Supply Field automatically donated 447,000 yuan to support the Korean People's Army.

　　劳模带头努力抗美援朝
    东北煤矿生产竞赛获成绩
    京市各厂工人竞赛生产捐献工资严防特务
    【本报讯】全东北各矿区已普遍展开爱国主义生产竞赛，已获初步成绩。据东北煤矿管理局所属七个矿区统计：十一月第一周的产量比十月份第一周产量增加了百分之四十三。质量也普遍提高。在高度爱国主义热情鼓舞下，职工们自觉地加强了劳动纪律，出勤率近一周来达到百分之九十二以上。事故继续减少。各矿竞赛所以能迅速开展，是由于对职工进行了时事教育，尤其出席全国劳模代表会议的劳模们积极带头，启发了广大职工的爱国热情。如张子富、施玉海、李庆萱等劳模自北京开会回来，即到各矿区巡回讲演，号召职工反抗美帝侵略，进行爱国主义的生产竞赛。模范职工及先进小组纷纷响应。其次，当竞赛发起后，工会干部即深入下层，进行具体帮助，使竞赛运动有领导地进行。全东北各矿区工会干部有百分之六十五以上到矿、坑基层工会帮助工作。东北煤矿总工会部长以上干部曾率领四个小组分别到抚顺、鸡西、西安等地，深入领导，吸取经验。第三，党、行政、工会的密切配合，也是竞赛运动迅速开展的原因之一。
    但根据煤矿工会东北委员会对各矿区竞赛运动的检查，发现有以下的缺点与偏向，亟须纠正：（一）运动范围不够广泛，大部分职员、技术人员、卫生人员等尚未投入竞赛运动。（二）某些矿区已开始发现“突击主义”的偏向，一切为着产量，而不严格执行安全技术规程。有的则不注意改善技术和工作方法，单纯提高劳动强度，使职工过于疲劳。
