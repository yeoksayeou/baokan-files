Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 21st -- People in various parts of Northeast China are writing letters and donating money and goods to express their sympathy and support for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army.

Staff members of various organs and organizations in Shenyang are extremely concerned about the heroic Chinese and Korean soldiers fighting the enemy in the severe cold weather. They are donating winter clothing to the Korean front to resist U.S. aggression. From the 17th to the 19th alone, fifteen units, including the Industrial Department and the Cultural Department of the Northeast People's Government, donated 10,081 pieces of cotton-padded leather clothing, hats, and shoes.

The work of donating money, goods, and sewing comfort bags is also being carried out enthusiastically in various agencies and schools. Eleven comrades in the Editorial Section of the Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government voluntarily donated one-tenth of their salary coupons (each coupon worth over 13,000 Northeast currency) to buy cigarettes, candies, and other items to fill comfort bags. At their initiative, this movement has now been launched in various units of the department. Within two days, staff members of the Health Department of the Northeast People's Government donated over 11.38 million Northeast currency. Female comrades are carefully sewing comfort bags. Zhou Shiqi and five other female students from the Northeast Commercial School voluntarily donated ten gold rings and a watch. Zhai Binhua, manager of the privately-owned Keli Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory in Shenyang, donated 300 ampules of cardiotonic produced by his factory to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army fighting in Korea.

In rural areas, in addition to stepping up the payment of public grain to support national defense construction, farmers are drying this year's harvest of fresh vegetables into dried vegetables and sending them to the Korean front. Farmers in the Sixth District of Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, have prepared 60,000 jin and are about to pack and ship them. Farmers in Shaoguo Village, Wuchang County, Songjiang Province, sent more than 1,500 jin in one day. In addition to drying over 1,000 jin of dried vegetables, farmers in Liuhe Village, Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, also donated 300 eggs to the Korean People's Army.

People in various places are also writing letters to express their sympathy to the Chinese and Korean soldiers fighting side by side. All the teachers and students of the Heilongjiang Provincial Administrative Cadre School have written 160 letters. More than 1,200 teachers and students of Shenyang No. 7 Middle School are preparing to write a letter to the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army. In their letter of sympathy, the people of the Seventh District of Zhaozhou County, Heilongjiang Province, wrote: We, the 13,000 people in the entire district, are encouraged by your heroic actions of volunteering to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. We are determined to follow your example, step up production, and contribute all our manpower and material resources to support the Korean people's war of liberation. We wish you to annihilate more enemies in the battle where you are tempered into steel!

    在农村中，农民们除了一面加紧缴纳公粮以支援国防建设外，并纷纷将今年收获的新鲜蔬菜晒成菜干，送往朝鲜前线。黑龙江省海伦县六区农民已准备好六万斤，即将装包启运。松江省五常县烧锅村农民在一天内就送了一千五百多斤。黑龙江省绥化县六合村农民，除晒出一千余斤干菜外，还捐了三百个鸡蛋给朝鲜人民军。
