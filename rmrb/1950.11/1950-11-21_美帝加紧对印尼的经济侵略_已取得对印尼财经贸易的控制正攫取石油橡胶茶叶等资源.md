　　Xinhua News Agency, 20th. US imperialism is intensifying its economic aggression against Indonesia. According to a United Press Washington dispatch: The "U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration," the implementing agency for American economic aggression, signed an "Indonesia-United States Economic Assistance Agreement" with the Indonesian government in Jakarta on October 16. The "ECA" declared that the contents of the agreement would be "similar to those concluded with the enslaved 'European Economic Cooperation countries'." According to this agreement, the "ECA" will grant Indonesia a portion of the $40 million previously earmarked for Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. However, the agreement stipulates the conditions for the Indonesian government to accept American "aid," namely: Indonesia must "eliminate artificial tariff barriers" to the United States; Indonesia must "cooperate" with the "ECA"; and in order to obtain "aid," the Indonesian government "must provide a matching fund for every dollar of ECA funding." According to a Telepress Agency dispatch: According to this "Economic Assistance Agreement," the United States not only seized the interests of Dutch and British imperialists in Indonesia but also acquired resources such as oil, uranium, and non-ferrous metals in New Guinea.
　　In fact, U.S. imperialists, through the American monopoly capitalist Fox, had long ago gained control over Indonesia's finance, economy, and trade. According to a Telepress Agency Calcutta dispatch: Although the "trade contract" signed by Fox, a senior executive of "Chase Bank" controlled by Morgan, with the Indonesian government in 1948, has ostensibly been abolished, Fox has consolidated the economic position of U.S. imperialists in Indonesia. This economic monopoly has made Indonesia's foreign trade virtually limited to the United States. American monopoly enterprises are currently seizing large quantities of rubber, non-ferrous metals, coconuts, tea, and other resources from Indonesia.
　　American monopoly capital has invaded Indonesia on a large scale. "American Overseas Petroleum Company" has already obtained the privilege of exploring and developing oil resources in Java. The company enjoys the exclusive right to supply Indonesia with petroleum products. "Firestone Tire Company" has obtained the privilege of 700,000 acres of rubber plantations in Sumatra and Sulawesi. "American Smelting and Refining Company" has also obtained the privilege of mining and refining non-ferrous metals in Indonesia. "Kaiser-Frazer Automotive Company" has signed a contract with the Indonesian government to build an automobile factory in Jakarta.

　　美帝加紧对印尼的经济侵略
    已取得对印尼财经贸易的控制正攫取石油橡胶茶叶等资源
    【新华社二十日讯】美帝国主义正加紧对印尼的经济侵略。据合众社华盛顿讯：美国经济侵略的执行机构——“美国经济合作总署”，于十月十六日与印尼政府在雅加达签订了一项“印尼—美国经济援助协定”。“经合总署”宣称：协定内容将与被奴役的“欧洲经济合作国家所订立的相类似”。根据这项协定，“经合总署”将给予印尼以前指拨给蒋匪的四千万美元的一部分。但协定中规定了印尼政府接受美国“援助”的条件，即：印尼对美国“取消人为的关税壁垒”；印尼必须与“经合总署”“合作”；印尼政府为了获得“援助”，“必须为每一元经合总署的经费照数提出对等基金”。据电通社消息：根据这项“经济援助协定”，美国不仅在印尼夺去了荷、英帝国主义者的利益，并且取得了新几内亚的石油、铀和非铁金属等资源。
    事实上，美帝国主义者早就通过美国垄断资本家福克斯，取得了对印尼的财政经济和贸易的控制。据电通社加尔各答讯：为摩根所控制的“大通银行”的高级负责人福克斯，于一九四八年与印尼政府所签订的“贸易合同”虽然在表面上已经废止，但是，福克斯已为美帝国主义者巩固了在印尼的经济地位。这种经济上的独占，使得印尼的对外贸易实际上只限于美国。美国的独占企业刻正由印尼攫取大量的橡胶、非铁金属、椰子、茶叶等。
    美国的垄断资本已大规模地侵入印尼。“美国海外石油公司”已经获得勘察及开发爪哇油源的特权。该公司享有以石油制成品供应印尼的独占权利。“费尔斯通轮胎公司”已在苏门答腊与西里伯斯获得七十万亩橡胶种植园的特权。“美国提炼公司”也获得在印尼开采及提炼非铁金属的特权。“凯塞·福莱塞汽车公司”曾与印尼政府订立合同，在雅加达建立汽车工厂一所。
