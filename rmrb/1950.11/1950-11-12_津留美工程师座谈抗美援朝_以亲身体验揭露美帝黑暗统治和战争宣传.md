　　Engineers Returned from the US Hold Forum on Resisting America and Aiding Korea
    Using Personal Experiences to Expose the Dark Rule and War Propaganda of American Imperialism
    [This newspaper dispatch] According to news from the Tianjin Daily: The Tianjin Engineers Society and the Tianjin Daily jointly held a forum on November 6th for engineers who returned from the United States to resist America and aid Korea. Those present included Liu Zaisheng, Chairman of the Tianjin Engineers Society, Zhang Huakan, Vice Chairman, Wang Yuyi, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, Zhang Kezhong, Dean of the Engineering Institute of Nankai University, Yang Cuifang, Deputy Director of Tianjin Steel Plant, and seventeen others. During the forum, everyone used their personal experiences and observations in the United States to expose the fascist-style dark rule, the frenzied propaganda of aggressive war, the decadent and corrupt culture and ideology, and the suffering of the people in the United States under American imperialism.

            Controlling Propaganda Tools - Instigating Aggressive War
    Tong Zhipeng, an engineer from the No. 2 Electric Factory, and others explained that in order to realize their ambitions of aggression, the Wall Street tycoons controlled all propaganda tools. The just voices of the people were suffocated, and what people saw and heard was war propaganda and obscene, numbing propaganda. Just after the end of World War II, American imperialism stepped up its anti-Soviet and anti-people propaganda, portraying the Soviet Union as a brutal and terrifying country and preventing the American people from knowing the truth about the Soviet Union. When Franklin Roosevelt returned from the Soviet Union, he wanted to introduce the actual situation in the Soviet Union but was severely restricted by the US government. A progressive professor at the school where Tong Zhipeng was at the time was dismissed by the school and could not find a job because he criticized the US government. When Tong Zhipeng returned to China, some professors said to him: You will return to your motherland, and after returning, you can speak freely and live a happy life, but what about me? I may not survive this Christmas before being thrown into jail by the government. Li Tianmin, an engineer from the Automobile Repair Factory, said: The so-called American culture is all about women's thighs, masked robbers, and money. People are numbed by this decadent culture. Theft, robbery, and prostitution are everywhere. People have lost their ideals in life and are mired in the swamp of decadence. In those "cities that never sleep" in the United States, people drink all night long, sometimes getting drunk and staggering around in the streets, still pouring alcohol into their mouths. During the day, many people go into movie theaters and never come out, sleeping inside. On the subway, some people sleep from one station to another and then back again. These people have no spiritual sustenance and spend their days sleeping.
            Hitler Slaughtered Jews - American Imperialism Persecuted Black People
    Everyone pointed out in the forum that Hitler once regarded the slaughter of Jews as a due right, while American imperialism regarded the persecution of black people as a publicly recognized law. In the United States, many restaurants and entertainment venues do not allow black people to enter. Some allow black people to enter but only through doors specially opened for them. Even toilets used by white people are not allowed for black people. In Washington, the so-called "civilized" city, black people are only allowed to sit in the rear carriages of streetcars. On a public bus, a sick old black woman was beaten and kicked off the bus for not giving up her seat to a white person. A black man built a house in a white area, but it was torn down three times and was never completed. The atrocities of排斥（discrimination） and massacring black people are openly published in newspapers everywhere. The only reason mentioned in a news item about the lynching of a black man was that he was walking down the street with a white woman.
            Economic Crisis - Workers Impoverished - American People Don't Want War
    Wang Naikuan, manager of the Tianjin Public Transport Company, said: In 1930, I was an intern at the Ford Motor Factory when I happened to encounter the economic recession in the United States. Overproduction caused prices to plummet. Although one dime could buy two pounds of bread, a large number of workers were unemployed and had no money to buy anything. They still had no food to eat and were homeless, sleeping in parks and using newspapers as blankets. Even workers who were not unemployed had their workdays reduced from five days to two days per week and were subjected to more brutal exploitation by the capitalists. Sometimes even if enough products had been produced, the workers' wages would still be deducted for the remaining twenty minutes. When I went to the United States for the second time in 1939, the economic panic was even more serious. Engineer Zhang Quan said: I was in the United States from 1947 to 1948. At that time, after the end of World War II, some wartime industries were shut down, and a large number of workers were unemployed. After returning to China, I learned from letters from American friends that the unemployment situation in the United States was even more serious, and unemployment registrations were increasing daily. It can be seen that the intervals between economic panics in the United States are getting shorter and shorter. During World War I, the United States seemed to have contracted stage one lung disease. Now it has developed to stage three lung disease, so it is attempting to launch a third world war. This also shows that the American paper tiger is approaching death. Engineer Liang Shufan said: In 1946, due to the economic panic in the United States, business declined nationwide, and a large number of workers were laid off. Therefore, a wave of strikes swept across the country. The strike of 250,000 railway workers caused trains to stop wherever they went, paralyzing the national transportation industry and causing greater market panic and urban paralysis, which frightened Truman. Engineer Tong Zhipeng said: Although the capitalists are deceiving the American people into going to Korea to fight an aggressive war, claiming that they are going to Japan for sightseeing, American people with a little knowledge are not willing to be fooled. Take Chicago, for example, half of those who were supposed to enlist in the military this time did not report. Some college students said to me: If I am forced to go to war, I will find a way to cripple myself so that my body is not qualified. Therefore, at present, American imperialism can only deceive middle school students of seventeen or eighteen years old into fighting an aggressive war. Engineer Zhang Quan said: When I was in the United States, I saw that it was very difficult for the US government to prepare for war because the people did not want to fight. A worker said to me: War is terrible, people's arms and legs will be broken, and this is all caused by the capitalists. This sentiment reflects the American people's deep painful experiences from several world wars. Therefore, the American workers' struggle against the capitalists is very fierce, and the workers' movement is also very widespread.

　　津留美工程师座谈抗美援朝
    以亲身体验揭露美帝黑暗统治和战争宣传
    【本报讯】据天津日报消息：津市工程师学会与天津日报于十一月六日联合举行留美工程师抗美援朝座谈会，出席有津市工程师学会理事长刘再生、副理事长张华戡、天津铁路局副局长王羽仪、南关大学工学院院长张克忠、天津钢厂副厂长杨萃芳等十七人。座谈中，大家以在美国的亲身体验和见闻，揭露了美国帝国主义法西斯式的黑暗统治、疯狂侵略战争的宣传、文化思想堕落腐化及人民生活痛苦的情形。
            控制宣传工具  鼓动侵略战争
    电工二厂工程师童志鹏等说明，华尔街大亨们为了实现他们的侵略野心，将一切宣传工具都控制在他们手里，人民的正义的声音被窒息了，人们看到和听到的都是战争的鼓吹和淫诲的麻醉宣传。在第二次世界大战刚结束后，美帝就加紧进行反苏反人民的宣传，将苏联宣传为残暴恐怖的国家，不敢让美国人民知道苏联的真实情况。当小罗斯福从苏联归国后，想介绍苏联的实际情形，就受到美国政府的严厉限制。童志鹏当时所在的学校，有一个进步的教授因为批评美国政府，被学校解聘，始终找不到职业。当童志鹏回国时有的教授同他说：你将回到你的祖国了，回去以后可以自由地讲话，过幸福的生活，可是我呢？可能过不了今年的圣诞节，就会被政府抓进监牢。汽车修配厂工程师李天民说：所谓美国的文化就是女人的大腿、蒙面的强盗和金元。人们为这样堕落的文化所麻醉，偷盗，抢劫，卖淫到处皆是。人们失去了生活的理想，混在颓废的泥坑里。在美国那些“不夜城”里，人们彻夜酗酒，有时喝得醉醺醺的，在街上乱闯乱撞，还仍然拿着大酒瓶往嘴里灌。白天，在电影院里有很多人进去就不出来，在里边睡觉。在地下火车里，也有人从这站睡到那站，又睡回来。这些人都是因为精神没有寄托，拿睡觉打发日子。
            希魔杀犹太人  美帝残害黑人
    大家在座谈中指出，希特勒曾经把屠杀犹太人当作应有的权力，而美国帝国主义把残害黑人作为公认的法律。在美国，有许多饭馆、娱乐场所不准黑人进去，有的允许黑人进去，却只能从专门为他们开的门道进出，甚至连白人去的厕所黑人也不能进去。在所谓“文明”的城市华盛顿，黑人坐电车只许到后面的车厢。在公共汽车里，有一个带病的黑人老太太因为没有给白人让座，在遭到一顿痛打之后，被踢下了汽车。有一个黑人在白人区盖房子，连盖三次，被拆三次，终于没有盖成。排斥和屠杀黑人的暴行在各地报纸上公开的登载着，有一则绞杀黑人的消息中所说的唯一的理由，就是因为这黑人和一个白种女人在街上一道走路。
            经济危机工人贫困  美国人民不要战争
    津市公共汽车公司经理王乃宽说：一九三零年，我在福特汽车工厂实习，恰巧碰上美国经济上的不景气，生产过剩，物价猛烈下降，一毛钱虽可买到两磅面包，但工人大批失业没钱买东西，仍然没有饭吃，无家可归，睡在公园里，拿报纸当被盖。就是没有失业的工人，每周工作日，也由五天减到两天，并受到资本家更残酷的剥削，有时产品出够了，剩下二十分钟也要扣工人的工资。当一九三九年我第二次去美国时，经济恐慌的情形更加严重。工程师张铨说：我一九四七到一九四八年在美国，那时，第二次大战结束，一部分战时工业停工，有工人大批失业。回国后，由美国朋友来信中知道美国人民失业的情形更加严重，失业登记日益增加。由此可见，美国经济恐慌的间隔越来越小，第一次世界大战时，美国好像患了第一期肺病，现在它已发展到肺病三期，因此企图发动三次世界大战，这也说明美国这只纸老虎，已经接近死亡。工程师梁树藩说：在一九四六年，由于美国经济恐慌，全国生意衰落，大量裁减工人，因此全国各地工人掀起了罢工浪潮，二十五万铁路工人的罢工，火车开到那里，就停到那里，使全国的运输业陷于停顿，造成市场的更加恐慌，城市的瘫痪，吓得杜鲁门也惊慌失措。工程师童志鹏说：尽管资本家欺骗美国人民到朝鲜打侵略战争，是到日本去游历，可是稍有认识的美国人，是不甘心上这个当的，拿芝加哥来说，此次征兵时，应入伍的有一半不去报到，有些大学生对我说：假如硬派我去打仗的话，我就想法残废自己，使身体不合格。所以目前美帝只能欺骗十七、八岁的中学生去打侵略战争。工程师张铨说：我在美国时，看见美国政府准备战争很困难，因为人民不愿意打仗。有一个工人对我说：战争不得了，人的胳臂腿要被打断，这都是资本家搞的。这种情绪反映出美国人民对几次世界大战痛苦的体验很深。因此美国工人向资本家的斗争很激烈，工人运动也很广泛。
