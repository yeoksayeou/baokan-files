Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 10th. The London "Daily Worker" wrote on the 8th: "The Chinese People's Liberation Army entering Tibet to defend China's borders, and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army assisting the Korean people – these are two major events that the Chinese people have done for the cause of peace in the past two weeks.” The newspaper described a series of provocative actions taken by the US imperialists against China since they attacked the Korean people, and quoted the declaration of various Chinese democratic parties on November 4, saying: “Facts have proved that the purpose of US imperialism in launching a war of aggression is to invade China and invade the whole of Asia. … Saving one's neighbor is saving oneself.”
The newspaper wrote: "The People's Liberation Army liberating Tibet, which has always been Chinese territory, is a heavy blow to the imperialists' war plans. This is why the imperialists are now screaming and threatening loudly. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army is currently fighting alongside the Korean people against American aggression. This is an active action taken to defend peace. Their actions are not only to defend peace in Korea and China, but also to defend peace in Asia and the world."

    中国人民解放军进军西藏是对美英战争计划的打击
    【新华社布拉格十日电】伦敦《工人日报》八日写道：“中国人民解放军进入西藏保卫中国的边疆，中国人民志愿部队援助朝鲜人民——这是中国人民在过去两星期中，为和平事业所做的两件大事。”该报叙述了美帝国主义者进攻朝鲜人民以来对中国所进行的一系列的挑衅行动，并引中国各民主党派十一月四日的宣言说：“事实证明：美帝国主义发动侵略战争的目的，是要侵略中国，侵略整个亚洲。……救邻即是自救。”
    该报写道：“人民解放军解放历来就是中国领土的西藏，是对帝国主义的战争计划一个沉重的打击。这就是帝国主义者们现在为什么要尖声叫喊和大声恫吓的原因。中国人民志愿部队目前与朝鲜人民并肩抵抗着美国的侵略，这正是为保卫和平而采取的积极行动。他们的行动不仅是为了保卫朝鲜和中国的和平，也是为了保卫亚洲和世界的和平。”
