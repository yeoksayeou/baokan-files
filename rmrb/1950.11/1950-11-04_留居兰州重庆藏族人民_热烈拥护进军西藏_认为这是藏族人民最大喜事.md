Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The news of the People's Liberation Army's commencement of the advance into Tibet and the liberation of Qamdo has brought boundless excitement and joy to Tibetan compatriots in the Northwest and Southwest regions.

　　Huang Zhengqing (Tibetan), a member of the Northwest Military and Political Committee now in Lanzhou, said excitedly after hearing the news of the advance into Tibet: The liberation of Tibet is what all of us Tibetans have been hoping for every day, and today it has finally been realized. This is the greatest happy event for the Tibetan people. He believes that the People's Liberation Army's powerful action in overcoming all difficulties and advancing into Tibet is a strong blow to the imperialists who are plotting to undermine China's unity. Shen Jichang, a Tibetan forestry model who attended the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, resolutely stated that after returning, he would mobilize Tibetan compatriots to support the liberation army in liberating Tibet rapidly with all their strength. After seeing the extra edition about the advance into Tibet, forty Tibetan students from the Northwest Nationalities Institute wrote letters of慰劳 (comfort/support) to the People's Liberation Army advancing into Tibet within three hours.

　　Sun Gebadon, a Tibetan compatriot currently in Chongqing, said: Qamdo, the gateway to Tibet, has been liberated, and Tibet will soon be liberated as well. This is the gospel for the Tibetan people. After recounting the oppression of the Tibetan people by the imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries, Tibetan woman Luo Xiuying said: A pair of chopsticks is easy to break, but ten pairs of chopsticks are not easy to break. From now on, people of all ethnic groups must unite closely under the banner of Chairman Mao to consolidate the victories we have won.
