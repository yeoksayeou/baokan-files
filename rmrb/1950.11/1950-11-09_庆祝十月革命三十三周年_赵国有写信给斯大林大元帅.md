Celebrating the Thirty-Third Anniversary of the October Revolution
    Zhao Guoyou Writes to Marshal Stalin

Dear Marshal Stalin, the great teacher of mankind:

　　Since returning to Beijing, the capital of China, from the Soviet Union on July 19th, I have been warmly welcomed by various government agencies, schools, and factories. I introduced the magnificent and orderly Soviet Red Army and the wonderful lives of mechanized laborers. When I introduced weapons that we had never seen before and couldn't even name: tanks equipped with mountain guns and anti-aircraft guns, mechanized units riding electric donkeys (motorcycles) and sitting in cars; all kinds of large cannons, including the thick and long cannons that had annihilated German fascists, with their glorious achievements marked on the gun barrels; rocket launchers, anti-aircraft electric cannons, four-engine combat aircraft, and supersonic aircraft, it immediately increased the Chinese people's immense strength and confidence in national construction and defeating the crazy aggressors of imperialism. As soon as I returned to the factory, countless workers surrounded me, asking about the work, study, and life of Soviet workers. I spent a week introducing the great construction of the Soviet Union and the wonderful lives of workers, women, and children to various factories. What the workers envied most were model workshops (where all workers were Stakhanovites) and inspection-free workshops. I also introduced the situation of the Leningrad shoe factory: before the war, the factory had more than 11,000 workers. During the war, the factory suffered the most brutal destruction from the German fascist army. At that time, the factory was only fifteen kilometers from the front line. Bombs and shells fell on the workshops, and not a single one was complete. At that time, only two hundred workers remained in the factory, working under bombardment. The rest of the workers changed jobs, and some bravely took up guns and went to the front line to kill the enemy. They lived in extreme hardship, with almost everyone eating only half a catty of bread a day, and sometimes even going hungry, but even in such difficult days, the workers still persisted in their work and carried out socialist production competitions. I also introduced the Stalin tank factory to everyone. During the war, the enemy even reached the factory gate, but the workers were still producing tanks in the factory, and at the same time, the workers themselves drove out tanks and defeated the enemy. After hearing these things, the Chinese workers were inspired with a high degree of production enthusiasm and proposed to learn from the Soviet model workshops and the spirit of bravely fighting the enemy. Since July, all the workers in the Second Workshop of our Third Machine Factory have been learning from the experience of model workshops (all workers are Stakhanovites). With the active and enthusiastic help of the experts you sent, we are working on the machines we made ourselves and on the exquisite machines you helped us with from eight thousand miles away. We have already achieved good results: in three months, we produced more than three thousand parts, with no rejects, all of which were qualified. The average exceeded the production task by more than 24% in July and August. The monthly production task for September was completed in fifteen days. In October, we received a certificate of merit signed by Chairman Mao at the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers.

    Our factory is advancing vigorously in this way, and the lives of the workers are gradually improving. However, the American imperialists are not allowing us to restore construction and live a good life. They are launching a bloody war of aggression in Korea, trying to destroy and prevent us from moving towards a happy life: we firmly believe that all the conspiracies and atrocities of the American imperialists will never stop us from moving towards a better life.

    Today, the American imperialists are expanding the war of aggression in Korea, trying to spread the flames of war to our country. This is something that the Chinese people can no longer tolerate. Marshal Stalin! We assure you: we will definitely support the just war of the Korean people with all our invincible strength, and together with the Korean people, smash the aggression of the American imperialists. We must learn from the Soviet workers' experience in fighting the enemy. Now our Shenyang workers have taken action and launched a patriotic anti-American production competition. We are turning our hatred for the American imperialists into strength. Although the production task for October in the Second Workshop of our Shenyang Third Machine Factory was increased by ten lathe parts, the monthly production task was completed in twenty days. The attendance rate broke all past records. The attendance rate in October was 98.6%, exceeding the attendance rate in September. All the workers are working hard to prepare, turning the factory into a battlefield and the machines into weapons, actively increasing production to support the People's Liberation Army and the Korean people in smashing the aggressive atrocities of the American imperialists. We will fight to the end to defend the motherland, continue to develop the people's revolutionary struggle and the people's construction cause, and defend world peace.

　　庆祝十月革命三十三周年
    赵国有写信给斯大林大元帅亲爱的世界人类导师斯大林大元帅：
    我七月十九日从苏联回到了中国首都——北京以后，各界机关、学校、工厂，都热烈欢迎我介绍了苏联雄壮整齐的红军，及机械化劳动者们美好生活情形部队。当我介绍我们从来未见过也叫不出名字的武器：有坦克车上装置着山炮和高射炮，机械化部队都骑着电驴子（摩托车）和坐着汽车；各种各样的大炮，其中粗又长的大炮，曾消灭过德国法西斯的大炮，炮筒子上标志着它的光辉战绩。火箭炮，高射电炮，空中的四个发动机的战斗飞机和超音速飞机等情况以后，当时就增加了我们中国人民对祖国建设和战胜帝国主义疯狂侵略者的无比力量和信心。我刚回到工厂，无数工友就把我包围起来，问苏联工人工作学习和生活的情形。我有一周的时间，到各工厂介绍了苏联的伟大建设及工人、妇女、儿童的美好生活情况。工友最羡慕的是模范车间（全车间都是斯达哈诺夫工作者），免检车间。我还介绍了列宁格勒皮鞋工厂的情况：在战前，这工厂有一万一千多工人。在大战中，工厂遭受到德国法西斯军队最残酷的破坏。当时，工厂离前线只有十五公里。炸弹和炮弹纷纷落到车间，全车间没有一个完整的。那时候，全厂只留下二百名工人在炮火轰炸之中在坚持工作。其余的工人转业，有的自动勇敢地拿起枪杆子到前线去杀敌人。他们生活困难万分，差不多每人每天只吃到半斤面包，有时甚至饿肚子，但就是在这样艰苦的日子里，工人们也仍然坚持工作，搞社会主义生产竞赛。我也向大家介绍了斯大林坦克工厂，在战争时，敌人曾打到了工厂大门口，工人还在工厂里生产坦克车，同时工人自己动手开出坦克击败了敌人。中国的工人听到这些情况以后，激起了高度的生产热情，纷纷提出学习苏联模范车间及英勇和敌人斗争的精神。从七月份起，我们第三机器厂第二车工部全体工友就学习模范车间（全车间斯达哈诺夫工作者）的经验。大家积极的和热情的在您派来的专家帮助之下在我们亲手制造出来的机器上和自八千里路以外你们帮助我们的精美机器上工作。现已获得了良好的成绩：三个月生产三千多件产品部件，没有一部废品，全部合格。七、八两月份平均超过生产任务百分之二十四以上。九月份全月生产任务十五天就完成啦。十月份则在全国工农兵劳模代表会上获得了毛主席亲笔签字的奖状。
    我们工厂正在这样朝气蓬勃的前进，工人生活也逐步的提高。但是美帝不让我们恢复建设，不让我们过好日子，正在朝鲜发动血腥侵略战争，想破坏和阻挡我们走向美满的生活：我们坚信美帝的一切阴谋暴行决阻挡不了我们走向美好生活。
    今天美帝正在朝鲜扩大侵略战争，想把战火燃烧到我们身上来。这是我们中国人民所再不能容忍的了。斯大林大元帅！我们向你保证：我们一定以一切无敌的力量，支援朝鲜人民正义的战争，和朝鲜人民一道粉碎美帝的侵略。我们要学习苏联工人和敌人斗争的经验，现在我们沈阳工友已经行动起来，掀起了爱国主义反美生产竞赛。我们把对美帝的愤恨化成力量。我们沈阳第三机器厂第二车工部十月份的生产任务，虽增加了十台车床部件，但是全月生产任务，二十天就完成了。出勤率打破任何过去的纪录。十月份出勤率是９８．６％，超过九月出勤率。全体工友正在紧张的准备着，把工厂已变成战场，机器变成了武器，积极提高生产，支援人民解放军和朝鲜人民一道，粉碎美帝的侵略暴行。为保卫祖国，继续发展人民革命斗争和人民建设事业，保卫世界永久和平而奋斗到底。
          赵国有
