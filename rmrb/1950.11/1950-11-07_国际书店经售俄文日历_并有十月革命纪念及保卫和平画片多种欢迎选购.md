    International Bookstore Sells Russian Calendars
    And various October Revolution Commemoration and Peace Preservation Pictures are Available for Purchase

    The 1951 Russian calendar has recently arrived from Moscow and is exclusively distributed by the International Bookstore. The calendar has sturdy paper and exquisite printing. Each page has important information related to the day on both the front and back, and it also includes various illustrations, making it extremely convenient for reference. It can be said to be a small, pocket-sized Soviet encyclopedia. Whether it is hung on the wall for personal use or given as a gift, it is very suitable. (The calendar costs 3,200 yuan each)

    In addition, the International Bookstore has recently received various propaganda posters on the themes of "Celebrating the 33rd Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution" and "Oppose Aggression, Defend Peace." These pictures are all from the hands of famous Soviet artists. On the one hand, they are records of the great victory of the Soviet people and sharp weapons against the mad dog of American imperialism; on the other hand, they are complete works of art that have reached a high level of achievement. Readers are welcome to purchase them. (Recommended)

　　国际书店经售俄文日历
    并有十月革命纪念及保卫和平画片多种欢迎选购
    一九五一年俄文日历最近从莫斯科运到，由国际书店总经售。该日历纸质坚实，印刷精美，每页正反面都印有和当日有关的重要资料，同时附有各种插图，查考时极其方便。所以可以说是一部小型的袖珍的苏联百科全书。不管挂置墙头自用，或者作为礼品送人，都非常适宜。（该日历每个三、二○○元）
    又国际书店最近运到关于《庆祝伟大十月社会主义革命三十三周年纪念》及《反对侵略，保卫和平》的宣传画多种，这些画片都出之苏联有名艺术家的手笔，从一方面看，是苏联人民伟大胜利的记录及反对美帝国主义疯狗的尖锐武器；从另一方面看，是达到高度成就的完整艺术品。欢迎读者往购。（推）
