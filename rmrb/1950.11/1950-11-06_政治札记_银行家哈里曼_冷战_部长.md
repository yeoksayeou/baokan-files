　　Political Notes
　　Banker Harriman - "Cold War" Minister
　　Besides owning the fame of inventing chewing gum and Coca-Cola, the "American way of life" has another unenviable reputation: it produces and exclusively sells international robbers and bandits.
　　The American robbers in our minds are not the ordinary robbers who rob banks and kidnap children in Hollywood movies that cost a dime to watch, but those "respected" banker bandits who are the owners of atomic bomb factories or bosses of other large-scale massacre tool factories. They have found that war is a million times better business than peace, so they are busy plotting and planning a new war day and night.
　　William Averell Harriman, one of Truman's "special assistants," is a typical American banker bandit who gets rich from the blood of the people. The Washington press, which calls him the "Minister of the Cold War," claims that he is the power behind the White House presidential throne.
　　In addition to being Truman's right-hand man, Harriman is also one of the owners of Brown Brothers banking firms and Harriman & Co.; chairman of the Union Pacific Railroad, director of five other major railroads; and director of Western Union Telegraph Company. In addition, he is involved in all the lucrative deals related to military affairs, such as aviation, shipbuilding, shipping, steel and mining companies. That is to say, of the billions of military spending approved by Harriman, as an official of the Washington government, a large sum of money went to banker Harriman's Wall Street treasury.
　　Harriman is a typical representative of the most reactionary and aggressive group of imperialist America. His father, E.H. Harriman, acquired millions of family fortunes by relying on the unprecedented, largest, and most shameless railway stock speculation in the United States. The elder Harriman dreamed of building an American transportation system around the world; during the Russo-Japanese War, he obtained high profits by lending money to Japan. There were many shady deals in his railway and financial transactions, so that the then American President Theodore Roosevelt described him as a "bad citizen," "thoroughly corrupt," and an "enemy of the Republic." After the death of the elder Harriman, his son William Averell inherited 70 million gold dollars, and, as expected, followed in his father's footsteps.
　　After World War I, Harriman and his partner banker bandit Dulles negotiated extremely profitable deals with German industrialists. It was also at this time that he joined forces with Anaconda Copper Company to gain control of metal deposits, chemical plants, and coal mines in Silesia.
　　During World War II, as is well known, Harriman was appointed as the American ambassador to Moscow. He obtained this position not because of his knowledge of international issues, but as a direct reward for his large donations to the Democratic Party. Even before the war was over, Harriman and Churchill were already advocating a "tough policy towards Russia." Even when the United Nations first met in San Francisco, Harriman was already notorious for his vicious, behind-the-scenes slander of the Soviet Union.
　　For five years, Harriman has been traveling between Washington, London, Paris, Berlin, and Tokyo as a super commercial traveler, preparing a new world war for anti-peace schemers.
　　He and Churchill planned to turn Britain into an American aircraft carrier - this plan is now being realized. He maintains close relations with German industrialists and former Hitler generals, with the aim of creating an aggressive West German army. Prior to his new appointment, as a "Minister without Portfolio" of the Marshall Plan, he did his best to undermine the militant working-class movement and peace movement in the Marshall countries.
　　Harriman the banker is one of the most vicious enemies of the working people. Just two weeks ago, the leaders of the reactionary American Federation of Labor even chose this war peddler to speak at the AFL's annual meeting. He told the delegates that "American leadership is necessary for world peace."
　　Let us state that this "American leadership" once dropped 24,000 tons of bombs over Korean cities in one night, which is higher than the highest record created by Hitler's air force in London.
　　The gold dollars in Harriman's bulging treasury are stained with the blood of millions of victims of the two world wars.
　　Peace advocates have made a full determination not to allow these Harrimans to exchange other people's blood for gold dollars again.

　　政治札记
    银行家哈里曼——“冷战”部长
    “美国的生活方式”除了拥有发明口香糖，可口可乐的名气之外，还有一个并不令人羡慕的名声：它生产了并专卖了横行于国际间的强盗土匪。
    我们心目中的美国强盗，指的不是一角钱看一看的好莱坞影片中那类抢银行，绑小孩的普通强盗，而是那些“受人尊崇的”银行家匪徒，他们是原子弹制造厂的主人，或是别的大规模屠杀工具制造厂的老板。他们发现战争比和平是一桩利益大一百万倍的好买卖，因此日夜忙着策动与计划一个新战争。
    威廉·阿佛瑞尔·哈里曼，杜鲁门手下的“特别助手”之一，是一个典型的，以人民的鲜血来致富的美国银行家匪徒。把他称作“冷战部长”的华盛顿新闻界宣称：他就是白宫总统宝座后的权力。
    哈里曼除了当杜鲁门的得力助手之外，还是布朗兄弟银行企业和哈里曼公司的老板之一；联邦太平洋铁道公司的主席，其他五条大铁道的董事；美国西部电报公司的董事。此外，一切与军火有关的如航空、造船、航运、钢矿公司等等有甜头的买卖，他无一不染指。这就是说，哈里曼，作为华盛顿政府的官吏所赞同的数以亿计的军费，其中有大笔巨款是跑到银行家哈里曼的华尔街金库里去了。
    哈里曼是帝国主义美国的最反动的侵略集团的典型代表。他的父亲Ｅ·Ｈ·哈里曼，靠着美国空前的、最大的、最无耻的一次铁路股票投机，而获得了几百万家财。老哈里曼梦想要建立一个环绕全球的美国运输系统；日俄战争时，他借对日贷款，获到很高的利润。他的铁道和金融交易中，黑幕重重，以致当时的美国总统老罗斯福都把他形容为“恶劣的公民”，“彻头彻尾的腐化”以及“共和国的敌人”。老哈里曼死后，他的儿子威廉·阿佛瑞尔，继承了七千万金元的遗产，而且，如一般所料，还步武了他爸爸的后尘。
    哈里曼与他的伙伴银行家匪徒杜勒斯，在第一次世界大战之后与德国的工业家议定了利润极高的买卖。也就是在这时候，他与阿纳康达铜公司联合，取得了西里西亚金属矿藏，化学工厂，煤矿的控制权。
    在第二次世界大战期间，如所周知，哈里曼被任命为美国驻莫斯科的大使。他得到这个职位并不是由于他的国际问题的知识，而是直接酬答他对民主党的大笔捐款。甚至在战争尚未结束的时候，哈里曼与邱吉尔已经在倡导“对俄强硬政策”了。就在联合国第一次在旧金山集会时，哈里曼已经因为他的恶毒的，幕后的毁谤苏联的言语而恶名远扬了。
    五年以来哈里曼仆仆于华盛顿、伦敦、巴黎、柏林与东京之间，作为一个超级的商业旅行家，替反对和平的阴谋家准备一个新的世界战争。
    他和邱吉尔在一起，策划要把英国变成美国的航空母舰——这个计划现正在实现中。他与德国的工业家，前希特勒手下的将领保持密切的关系，目的是创造一支侵略的西德军。在他新的任命之前，他作为马歇尔计划的“无任所大使”，竭尽力量去破坏马歇尔国家中的战斗的工人阶级运动与和平运动。
    哈里曼这个银行家是劳动人民最凶恶的敌人之一。仅仅两星期前，美国反动的劳联的领袖们还挑选这个战争贩子到劳联的年会作演讲。他对代表们说，“美国的领导对世界和平是必要的”。
    让我们说明一下，这个“美国领导”，曾经一个晚上就在朝鲜的城市上空投下二万四千吨炸弹，比希特勒的空军在伦敦创造的最高纪录还高。
    哈里曼的肿胀的金库里的金元是沾染了两次世界大战中千百万牺牲者的鲜血的。
    和平拥护者已经下了充分的决心，不许这辈哈里曼们再用他人的鲜血去换取金元。
