Xinhua News Agency, 23rd: Workers in Nanjing, Qingdao, and various parts of Central-South China are enthusiastically launching patriotic production competitions and have already achieved considerable results.

    In Nanjing's Electric Illumination Factory's Electron Tube Manufacturing Plant, production efficiency increased by 1.56 times in just the first six days of this month after the competition began. In the competition between the Xiaguan Power Plant and the Qishuyan and Jinan Power Plants, as of the 15th of this month, safe power generation has continued for 65 days without any accidents, and coal consumption has been further reduced to 0.68 kilograms. In the large-scale production competition involving 120,000 workers in Qingdao, the production achievements of the state-owned China Textile factories are particularly remarkable, with the output per spindle of 20-count yarn per 20 hours increasing from 1.02 pounds to 1.11 pounds.

    Since Wuhan and Henan took the lead in launching the competition in the Central-South region, competitions are now being widely launched in various places. Workers at the Jiangxi Machine Factory, under the promotion of Qiu Yeheng, a representative from the province attending the National Model Worker Representative Conference, issued a competition challenge to 600,000 workers in the province. Currently, railway, highway, coal mine, power, textile, postal and telecommunications, and other industrial units throughout the province are actively preparing to respond to the challenge. Huang Ruixi, a representative from Hunan attending the National Model Worker Representative Conference, who leads the central office of the Changsha Telecommunications Bureau, and Wang Yongxiang, a first-class model worker from the Hengyang Railway Bureau who leads the ironworker team, have launched a competition challenge to all employees in Hunan Province and the Hengyang Railway Bureau. Subsequently, units such as the Hunan Antimony Manufacturing Plant, Bin County Public Works Section, and Hunan Postal Administration Bureau have responded one after another. Employees of the Bin County Public Works Section guarantee that in the competition, they will increase the train speed from 50 kilometers to 55 kilometers. In the competition at the Guangdong Military Region Rubber Shoe Factory, the quality of products has greatly improved, and the scrap rate has dropped from 5% to 0.5%. At present, trade unions in various provinces and cities are deepening their leadership in a focused manner to make the competition movement more organized and planned.
