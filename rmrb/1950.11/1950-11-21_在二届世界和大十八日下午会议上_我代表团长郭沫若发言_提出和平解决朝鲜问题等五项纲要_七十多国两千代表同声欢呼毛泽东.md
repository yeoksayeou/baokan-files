Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 20th (Delayed Dispatch) At the eighteenth afternoon session of the Second World Congress of Defenders of Peace, when Guo Moruo, the head of the Chinese delegation, rose to speak, thunderous applause shook the venue. Over two thousand representatives from more than seventy countries cheered "Mao Zedong" for several minutes.

    Guo Moruo said: The aggressive bloc headed by the American imperialists has moved from obstructing peace to undermining peace, from clamoring for war to carrying out direct aggression. "We, the Chinese people, love peace. The twenty-two million three hundred and fifty thousand people of China who have signed the Stockholm Appeal are excellent evidence. But precisely because we love peace, we resolutely oppose aggression."

    Guo Moruo continued: "We, the people of Asia, will never yield to the aggressors in order to defend peace. The Korean people are suffering disaster, and we cannot sit idly by." As he spoke these words, waves of applause repeatedly interrupted his speech.

    Guo Moruo said: The Chinese delegation fully agrees with all the points in the report of Chairman Joliot-Curie, especially regarding the United Nations. "The United Nations Charter and the principle of unanimity of the five major powers must be respected, and all illegal resolutions that violate the Charter or the above-mentioned principles must be promptly rescinded. The representative of one of the five major powers must be the true representative of the four hundred and seventy-five million people of the People's Republic of China, not the pseudo-representative of a small group of Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries. First, make the Security Council a living institution, and the security of the people of the world will gradually be guaranteed. We hope that the United Nations can take immediate measures and act in this way. We believe that all people who love peace and oppose aggressive war hold this hope. If the United Nations is constantly rendered powerless to meet this hope, we cannot stand idly by while world peace is threatened and undermined.

    Guo Moruo emphasized: The Chinese people are willing to join hands with the peace-loving people of Britain, the United States, France, Italy, the Soviet Union, Poland, Korea, Vietnam, Mongolia, and all other countries to take more effective measures to defend world peace and security. The Chinese delegation, on behalf of the Chinese people, presents the following five-point program to the Congress:

    1.  Stop the war of aggression against Korea by the United States and other countries, demand the withdrawal of all foreign aggressor troops from Korea, and realize a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. This is the central key to the struggle to defend world peace today.

    2.  Demand that the United States immediately cease any interference in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan.

    3.  Demand severe condemnation of MacArthur for instigating war; he is the main instigator of aggressive war in the Far East and the main instigator of expanding the Korean War into a world war.

    4.  Resolutely oppose the use of atomic weapons and demand that the government that first uses atomic weapons be declared a war criminal and sanctioned.

    5.  Demand that all countries in the world simultaneously reduce armaments, establish effective controls, and suggest that the people of all countries cooperate with each other in economic and cultural construction in peaceful life.

    After Guo Moruo finished his speech, the Chinese delegation presented flags to the Presidium of the Congress and the Polish Peace Committee, and the entire audience stood up, applauded, and cheered.

　　在二届世界和大十八日下午会议上
    我代表团长郭沫若发言
    提出和平解决朝鲜问题等五项纲要
    七十多国两千代表同声欢呼毛泽东
    【新华社二十日讯】华沙十八日电（迟到）在第二届世界保卫和平大会十八日下午会议上，中国代表团团长郭沫若起立发言时，暴风雨般的掌声震撼了会场。七十多个国家的两千多位代表欢呼“毛泽东”达数分钟之久。
    郭沫若说：以美帝国主义者为首的侵略集团已经从阻挠和平走到了破坏和平，从叫嚣战争走到了实行直接的侵略。“我们中国人民是爱好和平的。中国的两万二千三百五十万的人民已经在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名，便是绝好的证据。但正因为我们爱好和平，所以我们坚决地反对侵略”。
    郭沫若继称：“我们亚洲人民为了和平的保卫是决不向侵略者屈服的。朝鲜人民遭受着灾难，我们不能坐视不理。”在他说这些话的时候，彼伏此起的掌声频频打断了他的演说。
    郭沫若说：中国代表团完全赞同约里奥—居里主席报告中的各项，尤其是关于联合国的一项。“联合国宪章及五大国一致的原则必须受尊重，违反宪章或上述原则的一切非法的决议必须及时取消。五大国之一的代表必须是中华人民共和国四亿七千五百万人民的真正代表，而不是一小撮蒋介石反动派的伪代表。首先使安理会成为一个有生命的机构，全世界人民的安全就有把握会逐渐得到保障。我们希望联合国能够采取立即的措施，这样行动起来。我们相信所有爱和平和反对侵略战争的人们也抱着这种希望。如果联合国被使得经常无力适应这种希望，我们是不能坐视世界和平受威胁和破坏的。
    郭沫若强调称：中国人民愿意与英、美、法、意、苏联、波兰、朝鲜、越南、蒙古和所有其他国家的爱好和平人民携起手来，采取更有效的办法来保卫世界和平与安全。中国代表团奉中国人民之命向大会提出五项纲领。
    一、制止美国和其他国家侵略朝鲜的战争，要求从朝鲜撤退一切外国侵略军，实现朝鲜问题的和平解决。这是今日保卫世界和平的斗争的中心关键。
    二、要求美国立即停止对于中国人民解放台湾的任何干涉。
    三、要求严厉斥责麦克阿瑟挑拨战争，他是远东侵略战争的主要制造者和将朝鲜战争扩大为世界战争的主要煽动者。
    四、坚决反对原子武器的使用，并要求宣布首先使用原子武器的政府为战争罪犯而加以制裁。
    五、要求世界各国同时裁减军备，建立有效的管制，并建议各国人民在和平生活中作经济文化建设上的相互协助。
    郭沫若演说完毕后，中国代表团向大会主席团及波兰和平委员会献旗，全场起立鼓掌欢呼。
