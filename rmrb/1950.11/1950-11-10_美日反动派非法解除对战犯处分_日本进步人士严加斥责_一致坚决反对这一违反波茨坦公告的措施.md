Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Japanese progressives unanimously condemned the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries for illegally lifting the purge punishments of a large number of reactionary elements. According to a United Press dispatch on October 15th: Japanese Communist Party member of the House of Representatives, Yoshimori Fukazawa, stated in a talk: The reactionaries are illegally "purging" Japanese Communist Party leaders and other progressives on the one hand, while lifting the purges of 10,090 war criminals who participated in the war of aggression on the other. This fully exposes the reactionaries' intention to restore Japanese militarism. Standing on the position of thoroughly implementing the Potsdam Proclamation, we resolutely oppose this reactionary measure.

Zizhi Yoshida, Chairman of the All-Japan Federation of Industrial Unions, after condemning the reactionaries' measure as violating the Potsdam Proclamation, pointed out: The world situation, especially the situation in Asia, is completely different from before. The current ruling class, colluding with the chief culprits of militarist Japan as before, will inevitably be overthrown by the Japanese people who love peace and strive for national independence and the democratic forces of the world.

On October 13th, the Japan Labor-Farmer Party issued a statement, criticizing the lifting of the purge as a political conspiracy by the Yoshida government to support reactionary elements. The party will resolutely crush this conspiracy and carry out a thorough struggle against the reactionary elements.

　　美日反动派非法解除对战犯处分
    日本进步人士严加斥责
    一致坚决反对这一违反波茨坦公告的措施
    【新华社七日讯】日本进步人士一致斥责美、日反动派非法解除大批反动分子的整肃处分。据联合通讯社十月十五日讯：日本共产党众议员深泽义守发表谈话称：反动派一方面非法“整肃”日共领袖及其他进步人士，另一方面却对参与侵略战争的一万零九十名战犯解除整肃，这充分暴露了反动派恢复日本军国主义的意图。我们站在彻底实行波茨坦公告的立场，坚决反对这一反动措施。
    全日产业别工会联合会主席吉田资治在斥责反动派这一措施是违反波茨坦公告后，指出：世界的形势，特别是亚洲的形势，已完全和以前不同了。和以前军国主义日本的首恶分子勾结的现在的统治阶级，必会被爱好和平及争取民族独立的日本人民与全世界民主力量所打倒。
    日本劳农党于十月十三日发表声明，抨击解除整肃是吉田政府扶植反动分子的政治阴谋。该党将坚决粉碎这一阴谋，并与反动分子进行彻底的斗争。
