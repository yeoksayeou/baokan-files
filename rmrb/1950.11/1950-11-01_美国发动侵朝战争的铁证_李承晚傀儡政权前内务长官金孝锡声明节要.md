　　Ironclad Proof of the US Launching the War of Aggression Against Korea
    --Excerpts from the Statement of Kim Hyo-seok, Former Minister of Internal Affairs of the Syngman Rhee Puppet Regime
    The Korean newspapers published a new statement by Kim Hyo-seok, the former Minister of Internal Affairs of the Syngman Rhee puppet government. In his statement, Kim Hyo-seok cited many facts sufficient to prove that the war launched in Korea after long preparations and in accordance with the direct orders of the US imperialists, was for the purpose of mass slaughter of the Korean people and turning Korea into a US colony.
    Kim Hyo-seok spoke of the shameful role he personally played in instigating the Korean civil war, and vowed to atone for his sins by serving the people with loyalty in the future, and further wrote: What activities did US Ambassador to the Syngman Rhee “government” Muccio and US Military Advisory Group Chief Roberts carry out, and how did they lead the preparations for the war against North Korea?
    Kim Hyo-seok said: Once, I went to the US Embassy with US police advisor Peche. After talking about ordinary topics, Muccio said to us:
    “Policy is power. If one force conflicts with another, then the government will not hesitate to take any methods or means. The strong will win, and the weak will lose. The victor is king, and the defeated are bandits. That is why, in order to preserve the regime and maintain peace, it is necessary to crush the enemy's power and eliminate it. What must be considered is how to implement the established goals, without considering what means to take, and as the Minister of Internal Affairs, you must thoroughly eliminate the Labor Party, which is a serious danger to the Republic, and therefore take extremely cruel suppression measures. I am a representative of the United States, and I want to call your attention to this."
    Kim Hyo-seok further pointed out: "Therefore, whether during the period of US military occupation or under the rule of the Syngman Rhee gang that replaced the US military occupation, the US imperialists, in order to achieve their greedy goals, carried out arrests and intimidation, and massacred the Korean people."
    Kim Hyo-seok then recounted how Muccio, Roberts, and others led the most brutal punishment of patriotic people on Jeju Island.
    He said: On February 15, 1949, a meeting was held at the headquarters of the US Military Advisory Group, attended by Roberts, Peche, Hoffman, Shin Sung-mo, Chae Byeong-deok, Jeon Il-gwan (transliteration) and me. We discussed how to crush the Jeju Island people's uprising. Roberts said at this meeting: "In order to suppress the rebellion, police expeditionary forces should be sent to the island, and we have already passed the decision to transport them by US submarines and warships. Therefore, we should no longer be anxious about this issue, but should better prepare to solve other problems."
    In accordance with Roberts' instructions, 3,000 elite soldiers and 1,200 police officers were sent to the island. The suppression plan was formulated by Roberts, who directly commanded the suppression on the spot with Minister of National Defense Shin Sung-mo. Five US aircraft also participated in these actions.
    On February 20, 1949, a meeting was held at Syngman Rhee's official residence, attended by Roberts, Muccio, Syngman Rhee, Shin Sung-mo, I, and five others. Muccio and Roberts emphasized at this meeting that Jeju Island was an extremely important military strategic location. They said: Therefore, destroying the rebellion on the island is an absolutely necessary prerequisite for attacking North Korea, and we must firmly control this island in order to maintain contact with Japan.
    From April 1948 to May 1949, 10,000 houses were burned down and more than 35,000 people were shot and killed on Jeju Island.
    Under the pretext of suppressing the heroic uprising of the 14th Regiment of the "National Defense Forces," Syngman Rhee's troops and police forces burned down the cities of Yeosu, Suncheon, Gurye, and the surrounding villages, and massacred many patriotic people and innocent residents.
    The "National Defense Forces" troops and police forces sent to Suncheon to destroy the uprising arrested 300 peaceful residents in the city, concentrated them in a large room in the school, and the next day 200 of them were brutally shot and killed.
    At the end of November 1949, a meeting was held at the US Embassy in Seoul, attended by Muccio, Roberts, Peche, Shin Sung-mo, and Minister of Internal Affairs Yun Chi-young. Muccio said at this meeting: "I believe that at this time of such an important event, taking decisive measures against suspected elements is a wise move. The Yeosu incident is not ordinary. Any effective destruction is worthy of praise and should not be criticized."
    Such cruel destruction of the Yeosu uprising was completed under the instruction and direct support of the US imperialists.
    Even according to the incomplete, fabricated materials of the puppet government, the number of houses burned down reached 5,000, and the number of Koreans shot and killed reached more than 6,000.
    Kim Hyo-seok further stated:
    "The US imperialists have long attempted to realize their aggressive intentions against the Korean people. Therefore, they used every means to support Syngman Rhee to complete the provocations and conflicts of the 'Northern Expedition'. In May 1949, at the 'Goseong' Hotel in Seoul, US Ambassador Muccio, somewhat drunk, said to me and Minister of National Defense Shin Sung-mo:
    'The United States is backing you. I hope that you will faithfully carry out all our instructions and advice, and believe in us in all aspects. The way to solve all problems is to have power. Greater efforts are required to solve many international problems. Only the United States has the power to solve your problems, but it should be resolved as soon as possible. I have no doubt that you will focus all your attention on preparations to accelerate the arrival of the time for a full-scale attack on the area north of the 38th parallel, and act according to the specific situation and our intentions.'"
    Roberts also talked about meticulous preparations. In mid-April 1949, in the so-called Minister of National Defense's office, with Shin Sung-mo, Kim Hyo-seok, and Chae Byeong-deok present, Roberts said: In order to destroy the guerrilla movement and the subsequent "Northern Expedition," it is necessary to build airports. Roberts said at the time: "I hope you pay special attention to this issue. I hope you first issue an emergency order to provide various assistance for the construction of airports in Yeongju and Wonju. This is an urgent task. Because this construction is the most important and urgent, it must be started first."
    This construction is part of the "Northern Expedition," and the US imperialists attempted to implement the "Northern Expedition" between July and August 1949.
    The Syngman Rhee puppet government executed Roberts' instructions and began to build airports in Yeongju and Wonju. In addition, in the second half of July 1949, US Ambassador Muccio summoned Roberts, Peche, Shin Sung-mo, Minister of Justice Ki Shin-ryeol (transliteration), and me to his place, and gave four instructions on the main measures to be taken in preparation for the "Northern Expedition" in July and August. These instructions stipulated:
    "During July and August, many preparations for the 'Northern Expedition' must be carried out. It is required to thoroughly prevent internal sabotage, arrest a large number of anti-government elements and members of the South Korean Labor Party, and strictly adhere to the National Security Law. I believe you will pay considerable attention to the arrests."
    In order to carry out these instructions, mass arrests and persecution of supporters of the left-wing camp were carried out everywhere in South Korea on the eve of the "Northern Expedition." Military advisor Roberts ordered the so-called "National Defense Forces" command to begin attacking the area north of the 38th parallel on the morning of July 25, 1949.
    A few days before this, Army Chief of Staff Chae Byeong-deok and Division Commander Kim Seok-won heard the following statement from Roberts: "Now begin to invade North Korea. This is a good attempt to start a domestic war. This is a living check of our strength in direct engagement with the enemy."
    However, the "National Defense Forces" that attacked the area north of the 38th parallel in the Kaesong area under Roberts' command had to retreat after suffering heavy losses under the attack of the Korean People's Democratic Republic's People's Army guarding troops.
    The "Northern Expedition" plan in July and August 1949 was made under the personal leadership of Roberts. This plan stipulated that the 1st Division should be the main force, and the number of the division must be expanded to the equivalent of an army, and the main force should be deployed in the Ongjin and Kaesong areas. Kim Seok-won was responsible for commanding the army's combat affairs, and he was directly commanded by Roberts. First, actively attack on the Northwest Front, and then coordinate this offensive on the Northeast Front. It was stipulated in advance to carry out an attack on Kaesong, and at the same time occupy Gyeonggang and Haeju from the Ongjin side. In the event of failure, only the area around Pyongyang would be occupied.
    When this operation plan was formulated, in addition to Roberts, Division Commander of the 1st Division Kim Seok-won, Minister of Transportation Heo Jin (transliteration) and others participated from the beginning. However, due to the failure of the battle in the Kaesong area on July 25 and the attacks by South Korean guerrillas, this detailed plan had to be temporarily abandoned.
    After this, Roberts repeatedly emphasized the necessity of periodically clearing the rear.
    In the second half of August 1949, I received a notice from the US Embassy asking me to go to the embassy immediately. When I arrived at the US Embassy, Muccio, Roberts and Peche were already there. Roberts said angrily that the attempt of the "Northern Expedition," which had been prepared for a long time, ended in failure due to heavy losses in the Kaesong area. He studied the reasons for the failure and the ways to remedy it.
    Roberts said: "You must also understand that the 'Northern Expedition' is absolutely necessary for us, and sooner or later we must complete it."
    After this, Roberts ordered Syngman Rhee and me to eliminate the guerrillas and restore 'total order' as soon as possible. And he said that he had personally drafted the "suppression" plan against the guerrillas.
    During the "suppression" period, Roberts and Peche had been to the guerrilla activity areas to personally direct the "suppression." Roberts thoroughly and persistently demanded the implementation of the "suppression" plan, sparing no means or methods, in order to eliminate the guerrillas as soon as possible.
    Kim Hyo-seok pointed out that in mid-October 1949, a meeting on the issue of "suppressing" guerrillas was held in Roberts' office. The attendees were Roberts, Peche, Chae Byeong-deok, Shin Sung-mo, and me. Roberts gave the following instructions at this meeting: In areas where residents provide food and clothing to guerrillas, the residents should be driven away and the houses burned down. He said: "In this way, we can cut off the connection between the guerrillas and the residents. We must also drive away the residents of those small places that can help the guerrillas." The police fulfilled these instructions 100%.
    In January 1950, a meeting was held in the office of the Minister of Internal Affairs, attended by Muccio, Roberts, Peche, Minister of Social Affairs Lee Yoo-young, Shin Sung-mo and me. We discussed ways to quickly eliminate the guerrilla warfare movement, and Roberts said that the immigration implemented to "eliminate the guerrillas" would achieve "great success."
    In accordance with Roberts' instructions, 10,000 houses were burned down in the guerrilla areas. Hundreds of thousands of residents were displaced and had to wander around in search of a place to live.
    During the winter "suppression" period in the guerrilla movement area, many innocent people died at the hands of the military and police. In Yeongcheon County, a mountainous area in Gyeongsangbuk-do, Syngman Rhee's soldiers used machine guns to kill more than 50 men, women, children, old people, and young children. Similar facts have also occurred in other guerrilla areas.
    In January 1949, during a meeting with Roberts, Peche, and DeLamorett (US military advisor) at the US Embassy, Shin Sung-mo said: "Some people may say that this is not good from a humanitarian point of view. But in order to achieve the established goals, this behavior is absolutely necessary."
    Under the instructions of the US imperialists, the outstanding patriots of the Korean people, Kim Sam-ryong and Lee Joo-yeop, were murdered.
    On April 15, 1949, at Kim Seong-gu's private residence, Kim said to me that according to Muccio, "catching Kim Sam-ryong and Lee Joo-yeop is a great achievement." Muccio strictly ordered the severe punishment of patriotic people. According to Kim Seong-gu, this is what he heard from Noble, an official of the US Economic Cooperation Administration in Korea.
    Kim Hyo-seok went on to talk about carrying out provocations on the 38th parallel according to the orders of the US imperialists, and then instigating the civil war.
    From January 1949 until the outbreak of the war, the "National Defense Forces" carried out nearly a thousand attacks on North Korea. I personally heard about this from Chae Byeong-deok in the office of the Commander-in-Chief of the South Korean Army. According to Roberts' orders, Kim Seok-won, the commander of the 1st Division, created the so-called Kaesong incident on July 25, 1949, in the preparation for the "Northern Expedition," but this provocation failed due to the strong counterattack of the People's Army guarding troops.
    After inspecting the Kaesong front on July 30, Roberts admitted that the situation was critical, and on August 1, he ordered the cessation of military operations. Roberts wanted the "National Defense Forces" that were isolated and helpless to bear full responsibility for the failure and heavy losses.
    After the failure of the "Northern Expedition" plan in July and August, Roberts emphasized the necessity of re-preparing for the "Northern Expedition." He attached great importance to the equipment and reorganization of the army, because the "National Defense Forces" had completely lost their prestige after the failure.
    No one volunteered to join the army, so compulsory mobilization had to be implemented.
    In November 1949, Muccio, Roberts, Peche, Syngman Rhee, Shin Sung-mo, Lee Beom-seok, Chae Byeong-deok and I were summoned to Syngman Rhee's private residence to discuss mobilization measures. Roberts pointed out directly at the time that in order to make the "National Defense Forces" a strong team, compulsory mobilization must be implemented, preparations for the "Northern Expedition" must be carried out, and all measures must be taken to consolidate the army. In order to implement this instruction, the police forces went to various villages, especially in Gyeongsangbuk-do, Gyeongsangnam-do, Jeollabuk-do and Jeollanam-do, indiscriminately arrested young people, and subjected them to torture and beatings, and then threatened and forced them to join the army.
    Roberts and Peche also wanted the police to prepare for the "Northern Expedition." In January 1950, in Shin Sung-mo's office, Roberts said to Shin Sung-mo and me: "The 'Northern Expedition' plan has been decided, and there is not much time left to implement this plan." Then he emphasized that in order to successfully implement this plan, we must first prepare our strength and improve the combat effectiveness of the "National Defense Forces." He said: "In addition, although we want to carry out an offensive, we must find an appropriate excuse so that people will regard our actions as just.
    Therefore, the report of the United Nations Commission is very important, of course, the writing of the report will be beneficial to the United States."
    Now everyone knows that the so-called "United Nations Commission on Korea" is nothing but a screen to cover up US aggression. The "United Nations Commission's" report was drafted based on "materials" collected by the US Embassy and other US intelligence agencies.
    Kim Hyo-seok further pointed out that the "United Nations Commission on Korea" had tried every possible means to obstruct the peaceful reunification of North and South Korea. The committee carried out the instructions of the US imperialists 100%, hindering the issue of peaceful reunification from being raised in the "National Assembly," and preventing discussion of the proposals received by the "National Assembly" in June. The undeniable facts of the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique launching the civil war were distorted in the "United Nations Commission's" report, which pointed out that it seemed that North Korea was the first to attack. All this proves that the "United Nations Commission" is an agent of the US imperialists.
    Kim Hyo-seok pointed out that, as mentioned above, when preparing for the "Northern Expedition," the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique attached great importance to expanding the number of South Korean troops and fighting the guerrillas. In September 1949, US Major General Chennault came to Seoul. His mission was to formulate a plan to expand the air force strength of the South Korean army. Chennault stayed in Seoul for a long time and established an air force organization with 78 aircraft. Chennault emphasized that in view of the geographical conditions of Korea, a strong air force was necessary. Following General Chennault, many US senators and senior military officials visited Korea, and their main purpose was to instigate the Korean civil war.
    Senator Knowland, a Republican who plays an important role in the US ruling group, came to Seoul in November 1949. He said that it was necessary to actively assist the South Korean "government," and after meticulously studying the area along the 38th parallel, he also talked about the need to make the police combat-ready.
    Sebald, the head of the Foreign Affairs Office of MacArthur's headquarters, came to Seoul in January 1950. Sebald wanted Syngman Rhee to believe that when the "Northern Expedition" began, US warships and aircraft based in Japan would stand on the side of the South Korean "government," and that he did not have to worry about the strength of the navy and air force. Following this, Syngman Rhee made a trip to Tokyo and received direct instructions from MacArthur on starting the "Northern Expedition."
    US State Department Advisor Dulles came to South Korea on June 17 this year. He inspected the 38th parallel area in detail, and then delivered an inflammatory speech in front of two divisions of the "National Defense Forces." He said: "While still in the United States, I heard about the bravery and combat power of your army. Today, I personally met those who can fight bravely and overcome all difficulties. What I saw was more than what I had heard before. Even the most powerful enemy cannot be your opponent. The time will come for you to show your strength."
    Dulles returned to Seoul, met with Syngman Rhee and Shin Sung-mo, and instructed them to immediately begin the "Northern Expedition." He demanded that active propaganda be carried out in order to "prove" that the outbreak of the war was the result of North Korea's invasion. Dulles said that although the domestic situation would be unfavorable after invading North Korea, it was necessary to persist for more than a week. The United States would use the excuse that North Korea attacked South Korea to force the United Nations to take action during this period, and mobilize the navy, army, and air force in the name of the United Nations.
    After receiving such instructions from their American masters, the Syngman Rhee clique began to invade the area north of the 38th parallel on June 25, thereby igniting this civil war.
    The US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique, who launched the war, attempted to shift the responsibility for launching the war to North Korea, and to cover up the US armed intervention and the crazy massacre of the Korean people in the name of the United Nations. Kim Hyo-seok wrote in the conclusion: "This is a barbaric invasion of Korea by the US imperialists. These crimes cannot be legitimate and can never be forgotten. The US imperialists have no basis or reason to armed intervene in Korea. The Korean issue should be resolved by the Korean people's own strength. The US imperialists should get out of Korea immediately! Korea does not allow US imperialists to interfere!"

　　美国发动侵朝战争的铁证
    ——李承晚傀儡政权前内务长官金孝锡声明节要
    在朝鲜报纸上发表了李承晚傀儡政府前内务长官金孝锡的新声明。金孝锡在其声明中举出许多事实，足以证明经过长期准备并遵照美帝国主义者的直接命令在朝鲜发动的战争，其目的是大量屠杀朝鲜人民和变朝鲜为美国的殖民地。
    金孝锡谈了他个人在掀起朝鲜内战中所扮充的可耻角色，并誓言今后以忠诚为人民服务来赎罪，进而写道：美国驻李承晚“政府”大使缪锡俄和美国军事顾问团团长罗伯兹进行了怎样的活动，他们领导了对北朝鲜战争的准备工作。
    金孝锡说：有一次，我与美国警察顾问培哲一起到美国大使馆去。在普通题目的谈话之后，缪锡俄对我们说：
    “政策就是力量。若一种势力与另一势力发生冲突，那末，政府不惜采取任何方法与手段。强者必胜，弱者必败。胜者为王，败者为寇。这就是为什么为了保住政权和维持安宁，须要摧残敌人的力量并把它消灭掉。必须考虑的是如何实行既定目的，而不应顾虑到要采取怎样手段，而作为内务长官的你，必须彻底消灭劳动党，该党是民国的严重危险物，因之要采取极刑的残酷镇压手段。我是美国代表，要唤起你对这加以注意。”
    金孝锡进而指出：“因此，无论是在美国军事占领时期，还是在代替美国军事占领的李承晚匪帮统治下，美帝国主义者为了达到他们贪婪目的，实行了逮捕和恐吓，残杀朝鲜人民。”
    金孝锡接着讲述了缪锡俄、罗伯兹等人领导怎样最残暴地惩处济州岛的爱国志士。
    他说：一九四九年二月十五日，在美国军事顾问团团长处举行会议，参加的有罗伯兹、培哲、霍夫曼、申性模、蔡秉德、全日观（译音）和我。讨论了怎样粉碎济州岛人民起义的问题。罗伯兹在这次会议上说：“为了镇压暴动，应当派警察讨伐队到该岛去，而我们已经通过了用美国潜水艇和军舰运送他们的决定。因此，我们不应再对于这个问题有所不安，而应更好地准备解决其他问题。”
    遵照罗伯兹的指示，派了三千名精锐士兵和一千二百名警察往该岛去。讨伐计划是由罗伯兹制订的，他与国防部部长申性模就地直接指挥讨伐。在这些行动中还有五架美机参加。
    一九四九年二月二十日，在李承晚官邸举行会议，参加的有罗伯兹、缪锡俄、李承晚、申性模、我和其他五人。缪锡俄和罗伯兹在这次会议上强调指出，济州岛是一个极重要的军事战略地点。他们说：因此，摧毁该岛暴动乃是进攻北朝鲜的绝对必要的先决条件，我们必须牢牢地控制住这个岛子，以便保持与日本的联系。
    从一九四八年四月起到一九四九年五月止，在济州岛上焚毁了一万幢住宅并枪杀三万五千多人。
    在“国防军”第十四团镇压英勇起义的口实下，李承晚部队和警察队将丽水、顺天、求礼诸城及其四近乡村统通付之一炬，并且残杀许多爱国志士和无辜居民。
    派去顺天摧残起义的“国防军”部队和警察部队，在该城逮捕了三百个和平居民，把他们集中在学校的一间大屋子里，次日其中有两百人都惨遭枪杀。
    一九四九年十一月底，在汉城美国大使馆召开会议，出席的有缪锡俄、罗伯兹、培哲、申性模和内务长官尹致暎。缪锡俄在此次会议上说：“我认为际此如是重要事变之时，对嫌疑分子采取断然措施乃是英明之策。丽水事件不是平常的。任何有效的摧残都是值得表扬的，而不应给予非难。”
    象这样残酷摧残丽水的起义，是在美帝国主义者指使与直接支持下完成的。
    即使根据不完全的，傀儡政府伪造的材料，被焚毁的房屋数目已达五千栋，而被枪杀的朝鲜人的数目达六千人之多。
    金孝锡进而指称：
    “美帝国主义者老早就企图实现其对朝鲜人民的侵略意图。因此，他们用一切办法支持李承晚来完成‘北伐’的挑衅和冲突。一九四九年五月在汉城‘高城’旅社，美国大使缪锡俄带有几分酒意地对我和国防部部长申性模说：
    ‘有美国给你们撑腰。我希望，你们要忠实执行我们的一切指示和忠告，在各方面都相信我们。解决一切问题的办法，就是要有力量。为了解决许多国际问题要求作更大努力。只美国才有力量解决你们的问题，但应尽速解决它。我不怀疑，你们会将一切注意力都贯注在准备工作上，以加速全面进攻三八线以北地区时机的到来，并根据具体情况和我们的意图行事。’”
    罗伯兹也谈了缜密的准备工作。一九四九年四月中旬，在所谓国防部部长办公室里，有申性模、金孝锡和蔡秉德，罗伯兹说：为了摧毁游击队运动和以后的“北伐”，必须修建飞机场。罗伯兹当时说道：“我希望你们特别重视这个问题。我希望你们首先下紧急命令在灵州和原州对于建筑飞机场给予各种协助，这是紧急工作。因为这种建设是最重要的，最紧迫的，必需首先着手进行。
    这种建设是“北伐”的一部分，美帝国主义者企图计划在一九四九年七月到八月间实行“北伐”。
    李承晚傀儡政府执行罗伯兹的指示，着手在灵州和原州修筑飞机场。此外，在一九四九年七月下半月，美国大使缪锡俄把罗伯兹、培哲、申性模、司法部部长机新烈（译音）和我召集到他那儿去，关于准备在七八月间实行“北伐”的主要措施给予了四项指示。这些指示规定：
    “在七八月间，必需进行‘北伐’的许多准备工作。要求彻底防止内部破坏，大量逮捕反政府分子、南朝鲜劳动党党员，严格奉行国家安全法。我相信，你们对于逮捕是会相当重视的。”
    为了执行这些指示，“北伐”前夜在南朝鲜到处都进行大量逮捕和对左翼阵营拥护者的迫害。军事顾问头子罗伯兹命令所谓“国防军”指挥部在一九四九年七月二十五日清晨开始袭击三八线以北地区。
    在此之前几天，陆军总司令蔡秉德和师长金锡源从罗伯兹那儿听到如下声明：“现即开始进袭北朝鲜，这是掀起国内战争的顶好尝试，这是我们力量在与敌人直接交绥中的活生生的检查。”
    但是，奉罗伯兹之命在开城一带进攻三八线以北地区的“国防军”，在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军守卫部队的打击之下，在蒙受了重大的损失之后不得不败退。
    一九四九年七八月间“北伐”计划是在罗伯兹亲自领导下制成的。这个计划规定，第一师为主力，必须将该师人数扩大相当于军，主力应布置在瓮津和开城一带。责成金锡源负责指挥该军作战事宜，他由罗伯兹直接指挥。先在西北战线开始积极进攻，而后在东北战线配合这一攻势。预先规定对开城实行袭击，同时从瓮津方面占领江景和海州。在失利情况下只攻占到平壤一带。
    制订这一作战计划时，一开始除了罗伯兹以外，还有第一师师长金锡源，交通部长许镇（译音）等人参加。然而，由于七月二十五日在开城一带战事失败和南朝鲜游击队的进攻，不得不暂时放弃了这一详细制订的计划。
    此后，罗伯兹一再强调必需定期肃清后方。
    一九四九年八月下半月，我得到了美国大使馆一份通知，叫我立刻到大使馆去。当我到了美国大使馆时，缪锡俄、罗伯兹和培哲都已经在场。罗伯兹愤恨地说，经过长期准备的“北伐”的企图，因在开城地区蒙受重大的损失失败地结束了。他研究了失利的原因和补救的办法。
    罗伯兹说：“你们也必须明白，‘北伐’对我们是绝对必要的，而且迟早我们一定要完成。”
    在这之后，罗伯兹命令李承晚和我，尽速消灭游击队和恢复‘全部秩序’。并且说道，对付游击队的“讨伐”计划他已亲自拟定。
    在“讨伐”时期，罗伯兹和培哲曾到过游击队活动地区，亲自指挥“讨伐”。罗伯兹彻底坚持地要求实行“讨伐”计划，不惜采取任何方法和手段，以救尽速消灭游击队。
    金孝锡指出，一九四九年十月中旬，在罗伯兹办公室举行了关于“讨伐”游击队问题的会议。出席的有罗伯兹，培哲，蔡秉德、申性模和我。罗伯兹在这次会议上给予下列指示：在那些居民以粮食衣物援助游击队地区，应将居民赶走，把房屋烧掉。他说：“这样，我们便可以切断游击队与居民的联系。还要把那些可以援助游击队的小地点的居民赶走。”警察百分之百地履行了这些指示。
    一九五○年一月在内务长官办公室举行会议，出席会议的有缪锡俄、罗伯兹、培哲、社会部部长李有荣、申性模和我。我们讨论了迅速肃清游击战运动的办法，而罗伯兹说，为了“肃清游击队”所实行的移民，将使之获得“巨大成功”。
    遵照罗伯兹的指示，在游击队地区焚毁了一万幢民房。成千上万的居民背井离乡，不得不彷徨于途，以求栖身之所。
    在游击运动地区冬季“讨伐”时期，有许多无辜人们都死于军队和警察之手。在庆尚北道一个山地的永川县里，李承晚士兵曾用机枪打死了五十多个男人、妇孺、老人和小孩子。象这类的事实也在其他游击地区发生过。
    一九四九年一月在美国大使馆与罗伯兹、培哲、德拉莫莱特（美国军事顾问）会谈时，申性模说：“有人可以说，若从人道主义观点来看，这是不好的。但是为了达到既定目的，这种行为则是完全必要的。”
    根据美帝国主义者的指示，杀害了朝鲜人民的优秀爱国主义者金三龙和李周烨。
    一九四九年四月十五日在金性球的私邸，金氏对我说，若照缪锡俄的说法，“捉到金三龙和李周烨是一大收获”。缪锡俄严格下令严酷惩处爱国志士。据金性球说，这是他从驻朝鲜经济总署官员诺布尔那里听来的。
    金孝锡进而谈到按照美帝国主义者的命令在三八线上实行挑衅，而以后便煽起了内战。
    从一九四九年一月起一直到战争爆发，“国防军”对北朝鲜实行了近千次的袭击。关于这点是我亲自在南朝鲜陆军总司令办公室从蔡秉德那里听到的。根据罗伯兹的命令，第一师师长金锡源在准备“北伐”当中，于一九四九年七月二十五日制造了所谓开城事件，但是由于人民军守卫部队强有力的反击，这次挑衅失败了。
    罗伯兹因于七月三十日视察了开城前线之后，承认形势危殆，遂于八月一日下令停止军事行动。罗伯兹要陷于孤立无援的“国防军”负失败和重大损失全部责任。
    在七八月间“北伐”计划破产之后，罗伯兹便强调指出重新准备“北伐”之必要性。他非常重视军队的装备和编整工作，因为“国防军”在失败后完全丧失了威信。
    没有自愿参军的人，因此必需实行强迫动员。
    一九四九年十一月，在李承晚私邸，把缪锡俄、罗伯兹、培哲、李承晚、申性模、李范奭、蔡秉德和我召集来，讨论动员措施。罗伯兹当时就直截了当地指出，为了使“国防军”成为一支强大队伍，必需实行强迫动员，要进行“北伐”的准备工作并采取一切办法来巩固军队。警察部队为了执行此一指示，特别是在庆尚北道和庆尚南道及全罗北道和全罗南道曾到各个村庄去，不分青红皂白地拘捕青年，并施以拷问和殴打，以后便威胁强迫他们去参军。
    罗伯兹和培哲还要警察必需准备“北伐”。一九五○年一月在申性模办公室，罗伯兹对申性模和我说：“‘北伐’计划已经决定，而实行此项计划的剩余时间已不多了”。接着他强调指出，为了顺利实行这一计划首先必须准备力量和提高“国防军”的战斗力。他说：“此外，虽然我们要实行进攻，但毕竟必须找到适当借口，好使人们把我们的行动视为是正义的。
    因此，联合国委员会的报告则是非常重要的，当然，该报告的写成会对美国有利的。”
    现时大家都知道，所谓“联合国朝鲜委员会”不是别的，正是一堵掩盖美国侵略的屏风。“联合国委员会”的报告，是根据美国大使馆以及其他美国特务机关搜集的“材料”草成的。
    金孝锡进而指出，“联合国朝鲜委员会”曾千方百计阻挠南北朝鲜的和平统一。该委员会百分之百地执行着美帝国主义者的指示，阻碍在“国民议会”上提出关于和平统一的问题，阻止讨论“国民议会”于六月间收到的建议。美帝国主义者和李承晚集团发动内战的千真万确的事实在“联合国委员会”的报告中被歪曲了，该报告并指出似乎北朝鲜是首先攻击的。这一切都证明了“联合国委员会”乃是美帝国主义者的代理机关。
    金孝锡指出，正如上面所指出的，美帝国主义者和李承晚集团在准备“北伐”时，非常重视扩大南朝鲜军队的数量及与游击队的斗争。一九四九年九月，美国陈纳德少将来到了汉城。他的使命就是在于制定扩大南朝鲜军队空军力量的计划。陈纳德在汉城住了很久并且成立了拥有七十八架飞机的空军机构。陈纳德着重指出，有鉴于朝鲜地理条件，必需有强大的空军。继陈纳德将军之后，又有很多美国参议员和高级军事官员访问朝鲜，他们的主要目的便是掀起朝鲜内战。
    在美国统治集团中举足轻重的共和党员参议员诺兰于一九四九年十一月来到了汉城。他说必需积极援助南朝鲜“政府”，并在缜密地研究了三八线一带之后，还谈到必需使警察作战斗准备。
    麦克阿瑟总部外事处处长塞鲍特于一九五○年一月间来到汉城。塞鲍特要李承晚相信，当“北伐”开始时，以日本为基地的美国军舰和飞机，会站在南朝鲜“政府”方面，并且要李不必担心海军和空军的力量。继此之后，李承晚作了东京之行，从麦克阿瑟那里得到了关于开始“北伐”的直接指示。
    美国国务院顾问杜勒斯于今年六月十七日来到南朝鲜。他详细地视察了三八线地区，而后在两师“国防军”之前发表了煽动性的演说。他说：“还在美国我就听到了关于你们军队的英勇和战斗威力。今天我亲自会见了那些能够英勇作战，克服一切困难的人。我所看见的比以前所听到的还要多。即使最强大的敌人，也不可能与你们对敌。你们显示自己力量的时机就会到来。”
    杜勒斯回到汉城，与李承晚和申性模会见，并指示他们立刻开始“北伐”。他要求进行积极宣传，以便“证明”战争爆发是由于北朝鲜侵袭的结果。杜勒斯说，虽然在侵袭北朝鲜之后，国内形势将是不利的，但必需支持到一周以上的时间，美国借口北朝鲜攻击南朝鲜将在此期间内迫使联合国采取行动，用联合国名义来动员海、陆、空军。
    李承晚集团从美国主子那里得到了这样指示后，即于六月二十五日开始侵袭三八线以北地区，从而掀起了这一次的内战。
    发动战争的美帝国主义者和李承晚卖国集团，企图将发动战争的责任转嫁给北朝鲜，并以联合国的名义来掩盖美国的武装干涉和对朝鲜人民的疯狂屠杀。金孝锡在结尾中写道：“这是美帝国主义者对朝鲜的野蛮侵犯，这些罪恶不能是合法的，也永远不能忘记。美帝国主义者没有任何根据和理由来武装干涉朝鲜。朝鲜问题应当由朝鲜人民自己的力量来解决。美帝国主义者应当立刻滚出朝鲜去！朝鲜不容美帝染指！”
