Supporting the Korean Aid Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army
    Beijing Workers and Students Enthusiastically Express Sympathy
    Donating Goods and Money, Writing Letters of Sympathy, and Making Sympathy Bags
    [Our Newspaper] In the increasingly fervent movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, Beijing workers and students have launched a wave of expressing sympathy to the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army. Patriotic and peace-loving warriors who hate American imperialism have been writing letters of sympathy, sewing sympathy bags, and donating goods, expressing their love and support for their volunteer army and Korean brothers.
    In addition to stepping up production and launching production competitions, workers from the Water Company, the East Water Plant of the Water Company, the Beijing Electricity Bureau, and the Highway Administration, among others, have been actively writing letters of sympathy and making sympathy bags. The Water Company workers have already written 41 letters of sympathy and made 53 sympathy bags; the East Water Plant workers have made 50 sympathy bags and written 50 letters of sympathy.
    As of the 21st, the workers of the New Pharmaceutical Factory had submitted 36 letters of sympathy, 61 towels, 31 pairs of socks, 5 pairs of gloves, and many items such as soap, pencils, toothpaste, and toothbrushes to the trade union. Many workers and staff members who have already signed up to join the volunteer army have written letters to the volunteer army and the Korean People's Army, reporting that they have decided to join the volunteer army and, before arriving at the front, will improve production with the spirit of volunteers. They also tell the heroic and anti-enemy fighters that there are vast numbers of people in the country supporting this just action against aggression.
    Three-quarters of the workers at Zhenhua Flour Mill have written letters of sympathy and donated慰问品. Many workers who could not write dictated to others, who wrote it down for them, and then carefully wrote their names, which they had learned to write only after liberation.
    In addition to launching patriotic production competitions to ensure that no raw materials are wasted, some workers at Danhua Match Factory are willing to donate their Sunday overtime pay to express sympathy to the soldiers fighting in Korea. Cao Kai, a worker from District 1, is preparing to donate 40 kilograms of millet every month from now on so that the volunteer army can exchange it for artillery shells to strike back at American imperialism.
    In schools, a warm慰问 movement has been launched while conducting anti-American propaganda.
    On the 20th, the North China People's Revolutionary University submitted the following慰问品 to the Beijing Education Union for forwarding: Union members donated RMB 18,200,3438 (including a gold ring and a silver coin that have been converted into cash), and 143 other clothing items; students donated RMB 41,143,950 (including a gold ring that has been converted into cash), six silver coins, US$520, HK$20, 14 shares of public bonds, 17 gold rings (including two platinum rings), one gold nugget, two gold necklaces, and 59 items including watches, telescopes, pens, and phonographs, as well as 76 other clothing items.
    On the 21st, Peking University submitted慰问 goods to this newspaper for forwarding to the Korean people, including seven gold rings, one gold chain, three gold medals, one gold cigarette holder, one British gold pound, one Turkish gold pound, one Sheaffer pen, fifteen pairs of cotton gloves, and RMB 1,925,440 in cash.
    The Tsinghua University Trade Union and the Housewives Association launched a movement for 1,000慰问 bags. As of the 21st, they had received 1,120慰问 bags and 1,038 letters of sympathy. Li Yingan, a student from Mining Department 2, has always had a poor family and has never wasted a penny. Recently, his father sent him 200,000 yuan for winter cotton clothes. After receiving it, he resolutely donated it all. Some classmates repeatedly advised him to keep some for pocket money, but he earnestly said, "The Korean people can fight on the front lines of the anti-aggression battlefield with their flesh and blood. It is right for me to donate all my money." This greatly educated and moved the students, and some departments raised the slogan "Learn from Comrade Li Yingan."
    In three days, the Yenching University Student Union received more than 300 letters of sympathy and more than 600慰问 bags. Some also attached a card to the慰问 bag, which read: "Dear comrades: Here are towels, soap... Use them to wipe away your sweat, wash away the enemy's filthy blood from your body, take a good rest, and prepare for the second attack, so that another enemy lies under your bayonet." The "Donate Grenades Movement" initiated by the Department of Journalism of the school was quickly responded to by students from the Department of Political Science and the Department of Sociology. As of the 18th, students from the three departments had donated 235 grenades (each equivalent to RMB 20,000), more than four times the original plan. The charity sale held by the Department of Western Languages also received many items. One student donated his bicycle. Li Tianxi donated a ring, and another donated a 12x telescope, specifying that it should be used by the Korean People's Army.
    Wu Bingying, Chen Fei, and Yin Manling, three students from the Normal University who had just returned from Indonesia and Siam, gave more than 2,000 quinine and aspirin they brought back from overseas to the Korean People's Army. Yi Xueqing donated all three of her mother's gold rings, weighing a total of five and four-tenths of a tael, and 300,000 yuan, which her mother had set aside for emergencies.
    Middle schools are also generally involved in this movement. Beijing Normal University has written more than 300 letters of sympathy. The 29 students of the second grade of the girls' middle school donated their pencils, soap, books, and other items to the Korean Aid Volunteer Army. The first grade, second grade B, and senior second grade of the Mongolian-Tibetan School have completed the "one letter per person" movement; each letter is filled with love and sincere feelings. Many students have made慰问 bags. Teachers and students of the School of Finance and Economics have written more than 300 letters of sympathy and made more than 20 exquisite慰劳 bags. Each慰劳 bag is decorated with exquisite colorful embroidery. Some are embroidered with red five-pointed stars, some are embroidered with peace doves, and some are embroidered with various inspiring and慰问 inscriptions. In the lower left corner of each慰劳 bag, the names of the students in each group are embroidered. Some draw cartoons on the慰劳 bags of American soldiers who are unlucky when they meet the People's Army. The慰劳 bags contain current affairs manuals, study diaries, and daily necessities such as soap and towels.
    This movement is still developing in depth.

    【本报讯】在日益炽烈的抗美援朝运动中，京市职工、学生掀起了慰劳中国人民抗美援朝志愿部队和朝鲜人民军的热潮。热爱祖国、痛恨美帝的和平战士们，纷纷写慰问信，缝慰问袋，捐献物品，表示对自己志愿部队和朝鲜弟兄的热爱和支持。
    职工们除了加紧生产，展开生产竞赛外，自来水公司、自来水公司东水厂、北京电业局、公路总局等单位职工，纷纷自动写慰问信，做慰问袋。自来水公司职工已写好慰问信四十一封，做好慰问袋五十三个；自来水公司东水厂职工已做好慰问袋、写好慰问信各五十件。

    振华制粉厂已有四分之三职工写了慰问信，捐献了慰劳品。其中很多工友不会写信，就口说了由旁人代写下来，然后再把自己解放后才学会写的名字整整齐齐地写上去。
    丹华火柴厂工人除了展开爱国主义的生产竞赛，保证不浪费一点原料，有的工人并愿意把星期天的加班费捐出来慰劳在朝鲜作战的战士。一区工人曹恺并准备从现在起，每月捐献小米四十斤，让志愿部队换成炮弹，去回击美帝。
    学校里，在进行抗美宣传的同时，便已展开了热烈的慰劳运动。
    华北人民革命大学，二十日送交北京市教育工会收转的慰劳品，计：工会会员捐献人民币一千八百二十万零三千四百三十八元（包括金戒指一个、银币一元已兑成款），其他衣物一百四十三件；同学捐献人民币四千一百一十四万三千九百五十元（包括金戒指一个已兑成款），银币六元，美钞五百二十元，港币二十元，公债十四分，金戒指十七个（包括白金戒指二个），金块一个，金项链二件，手表、望远镜、钢笔、留声机等共五十九件，其他衣物七十六件。

    清华大学工会和家庭妇女会发起一千个慰问袋运动，截至二十一日，已收到慰问袋一千一百二十袋，慰问信一千零三十八封。矿二的李荫柑同学一向家境就不好，自己从来没有妄用过一文钱。最近，他父亲寄给他作棉衣过冬的二十万块钱，他拿到手之后，毅然地完全捐出来。有的同学再三劝他留些零用，但他却恳切地说：“朝鲜人民可以用血肉拚在反侵略战场的最前线，我把所有的一点钱捐出来，也是应该的。”由于这件事而大大的教育、感动了同学，有的系级提出“向李荫柑同学看齐”的口号。
    燕京大学学生会三天的工夫，收到三百多封慰问信和六百多个慰问袋。有的在慰问袋里还附着一纸卡片，上面写着：“亲爱的同志：献给您手巾、肥皂……用它来擦干您的汗水，洗褪您身上敌人的污血，好好地休息一会，准备第二次的进攻，让敌人又一个躺在您的刺刀下。”该校新闻系发起的“捐献手榴弹运动”，很快就得到政治系和社会系同学们的响应。到十八日止，三系同学已捐献二百三十五颗（每颗折合人民币两万元），超过原定计划四倍以上。西语系举办的义卖也收到不少的东西。有一位同学将自行车也捐出来了。李天喜同学捐了戒指一枚，另一位捐出一架十二倍的望远镜，指定要给朝鲜人民军用的。
    师大刚从印尼及暹罗回来的吴秉英、陈飞、殷曼玲三位同学，把他们从海外带回来的二千多粒金鸡纳霜和阿司匹灵送给朝鲜人民军。蚁雪清同学更把她母亲给她以备不时之需的三个共重五钱四分的金戒指和三十万元全部捐献出来。

    现在这个运动，还正在深入开展中。
