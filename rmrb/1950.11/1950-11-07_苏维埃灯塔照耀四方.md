　　The Soviet Lighthouse Illuminates All Directions
    Situ Meitang
    The Soviet October Revolution is now thirty-three years old. The Chinese people, along with the broad masses of peace-loving and democracy-striving people of the world, warmly celebrate this great festival. This is not only a festival for the Soviet Union alone, but also a shared festival for the revolutionary people of the world.
    Only the Soviet socialist revolution has shed the light of dawn on the dark world, and pointed out the path to genuine liberation for all mankind. The October Revolution is the beginning and prerequisite of the world revolution. The hardworking and brave Chinese people accepted the revolutionary lessons of the Soviet Union, and became staunch and unyielding friends with the Soviet people. Furthermore, with the assistance of the socialist motherland, they were able to defeat the cruel and powerful enemy and establish the People's Republic of China. Although the struggle was tortuous and arduous, the tremendous achievements of the past year since the founding of the country prove that victory is certain! The Chinese people's gratitude to the Soviet Union is sincere and profound. They celebrate the Soviet revolutionary festival as happily as they celebrate their own, and this is the reason.
    We have resolutely implemented Mr. Sun Yat-sen's instruction to "take Russia as a teacher" and Chairman Mao's instruction to "lean to one side." The Chinese people, embracing a high degree of internationalist spirit, are heading towards a very correct path. Precisely because the friendship between China and the Soviet Union is so valuable, precisely because we are fighting side by side with the revolutionary people of the world, precisely because we are doing so strikes at the enemy's vital point, the imperialists and domestic reactionaries are afraid and furious. For thirty years, they have exhausted their conspiracies to isolate the Chinese people from the socialist Soviet Union, and exhausted malicious words to slander the Soviet Union's genuine assistance to the Chinese people. A very small number of Chinese people and overseas Chinese were fooled for a time, but lies written in ink cannot cover up facts written in blood. Are there still people who are willing to believe the ravings of the imperialists and their servants? No, they have long been bankrupt. The Chinese people must rely more closely on the Soviet Union and learn from the Soviet Union!
    Precisely because it cannot deceive us, U.S. imperialism has torn off its hypocritical mask and carried out armed aggression against our neighboring country Korea and our Northeast and Taiwan, and even used planes to harass our Shandong coastal areas. This is a blatant provocation by U.S. imperialism against the peace-loving people of the whole world, and a sinful manifestation of the imperialist countries' further organization of a "anti-Soviet" war. We really cannot tolerate it! The imperialists, who live by aggression and regard the Soviet Union as a thorn in their side, have forgotten that this is 1950, forgotten that atomic bombs can be answered with atomic bombs, and that the iron fist of justice can smash paper tigers. Imperialism is heading towards the grave, but before entering the grave, it妄想to destroy the world and immerse millions of peace-loving people in a sea of blood.
    However, we are not afraid of them! We will fight to defend world peace. The existence of the Soviet Union, existing so powerfully and indestructibly, is the hope of mankind. For thirty-three years, the Soviet lighthouse has illuminated all directions, inspiring revolutionary people with confidence in the inevitable victory of the struggle. The forces of defending peace have therefore risen to an unprecedented high. The superiority of the socialist system, the Soviet Union's scientific achievements in conquering nature, and the Soviet citizens' abundance of food and clothing, freedom and happiness, do they not prove the decay and decline of the imperialist system, and that capitalist countries have become scientific enemies, and that the poverty and suffering of the people under the dictatorship of financial oligarchs must rise up in revolution? The thirty-three years of the socialist system's existence, does it not prove that the imperialists have been "anti-Soviet" for thirty-three years, with armed interventions by more than a dozen countries in the past, and attacks by Nazi bandits later, but finally defeated by the Soviet Red Army in every battle? Today, the invincible Soviet Red Army, plus the victorious Chinese People's Liberation Army, plus other new democratic countries and peace-loving people from all over the world, united as one, with high morale, such a superior lineup, wouldn't it warn the war-mongers not to be so rampant and try to strike a stone with an egg? The facts are clearly laid out.
    Why does imperialism insist on seeking its own death? Why do the likes of Truman dare to openly clamor for expanding the war of aggression?
    Well then, on this joyous day of celebrating the thirty-third anniversary of the October Revolution, let us organize a broader force for peace and democracy, raise our vigilance, and work together to defend the bulwark of human peace—the Soviet Union! Since imperialism wants to bring about its own demise, let it die sooner rather than later! The Chinese people want peaceful construction, but the U.S. imperialists must invade us, forcing us to not only build but also defend ourselves. Then let us combine the spirit of internationalism and the spirit of new patriotism, aim our cannons at the heads of the enemies who dare to intrude on the Yalu River, and let that group of beasts taste the flavor of the People's Liberation Army!
    Chairman Mao taught us: "In the face of beasts, we must not show the slightest timidity." A just struggle will surely win! The peace forces headed by the socialist Soviet Union, united as one, will surely enable us to overcome difficulties and eliminate the ferocious enemy!
    Long live the indestructible fortress of peace - the Soviet Union!
    Long live the victory of the struggle of the peace and democracy front!
    Long live the glorious cause of socialism!

　　苏维埃灯塔照耀四方
    司徒美堂
    苏联的十月革命现在是三十三周年了，中国人民与世界爱和平、争民主的广大人民一道，热烈地庆祝这一伟大节日，这不特是苏联一国的节日，同时是世界革命人民所共有的节日。
    只有苏联的社会主义革命，才给黑暗的世界放出破晓之光，才给全人类指出争取真正解放的道路。十月革命是世界革命的开端和前提。勤劳而勇敢的中国人民接受苏联的革命教训，并与苏联人民成为忠贞不拔的良友，进而取得了社会主义祖国的援助，才能打垮残酷而又强大的敌人，建立起中华人民共和国。斗争虽然曲折艰辛，但建国一年来的巨大成就证明，胜利是确定的了！中国人民对于苏联的感激，是真诚深刻的，过着苏联革命节日如同过着我国节日一样高兴，原因在此。
    孙中山先生“以俄为师”的遗训，毛主席“一边倒”的指示，我们遵照着坚决实行了，中国人怀抱高度的国际主义精神，走向非常正确的道路。正因为中苏两国友谊之如此可贵，正因为我们与世界革命人民并肩作战，正因为我们这样做打中了敌人要害，帝国主义者与国内反动派就害怕、狂怒起来，三十年来用尽阴谋，想把中国人民与社会主义苏联隔绝，用尽恶毒词句来污蔑苏联对中国人民的真正援助。很小部分中国人民与海外华侨被愚弄一时，可是墨写的谎言，掩不住血写的事实，现在还有人肯去相信帝国主义及其仆从的梦呓吗？没有了，他们早已破产了。中国人民惟有更加靠紧苏联，学习苏联！
    美帝国主义正因为欺骗不来，也就撕破“佛口蛇心”的假面具，实行对我邻邦朝鲜和我国东北，台湾的武装侵略，甚至用飞机扰我山东沿海了，这是美帝对全世界和平人民的狂妄挑衅，这是帝国主义各国进一步组织“反苏”战争的罪恶表现，我们实在难以忍受！靠侵略过活，视苏联为眼中钉的帝国主义者忘记了这是一九五○年，忘记了原子弹是可以回答原子弹，正义的铁拳是可以打碎纸老虎的。帝国主义正走向坟墓，入墓前却妄想毁灭世界，将千千万万和平人民浸浴于血海之中。
    但是，我们不怕它们！我们将为保卫世界持久和平而奋斗。苏联的存在，那样强大到不可摧毁地存在，是人类的希望。苏维埃灯塔三十三年来照耀四方，鼓舞起革命人民对斗争必胜的信心，保卫和平的势力因而空前高涨起来，社会主义制度的优越，苏联在征服自然上的科学成就，苏维埃公民的丰衣足食，自由快乐，不就是证明了帝国主义制度之腐朽衰败，资本主义各国已成为科学的死敌，金融寡头专政下人民的穷困愁苦，非要起来革命不可了么？社会主义制度存在的三十三年，不就是证明了帝国主义“反苏”三十三年，前有十几国的武装干涉，后有纳粹匪徒的进攻，而终于给苏联红军场场杀败了么？时至今日，无坚不摧的苏联红军，加上百战百胜的中国人民解放军，再加上其他新民主主义国家和全世界各国爱好和平的人民，万众一心，士气昂扬，这样的优势阵容，岂不是可以警告战贩们不要那么猖狂去以卵击石了么？事实摆得明明白白。
    帝国主义为什么偏偏要自寻死路？杜鲁门之流为什么胆敢公然叫嚣扩大侵略战争呢？
    那么，好吧！当此庆祝十月革命三十三度佳节之日，让我们来组织更广泛的和平民主力量，并提高警惕，为保卫人类和平堡垒——苏联而协力斗争吧！帝国主义既然要自取灭亡，要死的就让他早点死去吧！中国人民想和平建设，但美帝一定要侵略我们，迫使我们非要于一面建设中并起来自卫不可，那么就让我们把国际主义精神和新爱国主义精神结合起来，用大炮对准敢于窜扰鸭绿江边的敌人的脑袋，好好地给那一群野兽尝尝解放军的滋味吧！
    毛主席教导我们：“在野兽面前，不可以表示丝毫的怯懦。”正义的斗争，必然获胜！以社会主义苏联为首的和平力量团结一致，必然使我们克服困难，消灭凶恶的大敌！
    不可摧毁的和平堡垒——苏联万岁！
    和平民主阵线斗争胜利万岁！
    社会主义的光荣事业万岁！
