Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 25th: TASS, New York, November 25th—The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly began discussing the issue of U.S. aggression against China on the morning of November 24th. This issue is titled on the agenda of the current General Assembly as "Soviet Union's Accusation Against the United States for Aggression Against China."

At the beginning of the meeting, Soviet representative Malik delivered a speech, in which he recounted that the Soviet delegation had submitted a proposal to the Political Committee on November 15, 1950, suggesting inviting representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to attend the Political Committee meeting and participate in the discussion on the issue of U.S. aggression against China. The proposal stated: "Because the Fifth Session of the General Assembly is discussing the issue of 'Soviet Union's Accusation Against the United States for Aggression Against China,' and in view of the fact that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has declared that representatives of the People's Republic of China should participate in the discussion of the above issue, the Political Committee hereby resolves: to invite representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to participate in the Political Committee meeting to discuss the issue of 'Soviet Union's Accusation Against the United States for Aggression Against China.'"

Malik said that the Soviet delegation based its proposal on the fact that Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, had, under the order of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, made three declarations to the United Nations, requesting that representatives of the People's Republic of China participate in the discussion of the aforementioned issue.

Malik said that the demand of the government of the People's Republic of China is fully justified, legitimate, and righteous. The Soviet delegation hopes that the Political Committee will accept the proposal to invite representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of this issue.

Chiang Ting-fu, the representative of the Kuomintang clique, opposed the Soviet proposal, once again repeating the commonplace slanders against the government of the People's Republic of China.

The Chilean representative claimed that he was unaware that the government of the People's Republic of China had made a request to the United Nations and therefore requested an explanation.

Soviet representative Malik spoke. He referred to the telegram from Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to President of the General Assembly on October 18, 1950, requesting that representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China be invited to participate in the United Nations' discussion of two issues: the issue of U.S. aggression against China and the issue of U.S. aircraft bombing Chinese territory.

Malik recalled that it is not a new thing for the General Assembly to invite representatives of a country directly related to the issues discussed by the General Assembly to participate in the discussion. For example, the Political Committee invited Italy in 1949 to participate in the discussion of issues concerning former Italian colonies, and the Special Political Committee also invited representatives of Transjordan to participate in the discussion of the Palestine issue.

Malik continued by recalling that in late September, the Security Council passed a resolution inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the Security Council's agenda on the issue of armed aggression against Taiwan, and now representatives of the People's Republic of China have arrived in New York to participate in the discussion of this issue. Malik then said: Therefore, the Political Committee already has a precedent to follow. The decision to invite representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of the current issue is legitimate, in accordance with the United Nations Charter, and completely just. It should be particularly emphasized that because the United States has undermined peace in the Far East through its policy of aggression against Korea, and has also violated China's sovereignty and threatened its security by invading Chinese territory—the island of Taiwan—the issue of U.S. aggression against China is directly related to the issue of international peace and security. The Chinese people have every right to accuse the U.S. government of hostile actions and aggression against China, and the aggression is expanding daily. The presence of representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is also reasonable and fully justified, because it is this government that has all the legitimate rights and grounds to send representatives to the United Nations and participate in the work of the United Nations.

Kiselev, the head of the Belarusian delegation, supported the proposal of the Soviet delegation. Kiselev said: The presence of representatives of the People's Republic of China is absolutely necessary when discussing this issue, because this issue directly affects peace and security in the Far East. Czechoslovak representative Hachdu also supported the Soviet proposal.

Egyptian representative Rafat insisted that the Security Council's decision to invite representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China did not constitute a precedent for the current situation because the People's Republic of China is not a party to the dispute. However, the Egyptian representative declared that he would state his final position later.

Malik replied to the Egyptian representative's statement, saying that the issue of U.S. aggression against China and the issue of U.S. aircraft bombing Chinese territory were both included on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly at the request of the Soviet delegation, based on documents from the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. Malik pointed out that the reason why the Soviet delegation suggested including these issues on the agenda was because some representatives—especially the U.S. representative—said that if these issues were raised in the form of a complaint by the People's Republic of China, they would vote against including them on the agenda. In view of the importance of these issues, the Soviet delegation suggested that these issues be raised as a complaint by the Soviet Union. Malik said: However, the Soviet delegation stated in the General Committee that these two issues are actually complaints from the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and this government is essentially the plaintiff.

The representatives of Ecuador, Australia, and Syria made some reservations regarding their governments' attitude towards the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. However, they still said that their delegations would vote in favor of the Soviet proposal to invite representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to attend the Political Committee meeting and state their opinions on the "accusation of U.S. aggression against China."

Polish representative Katz-Suchy also supported the Soviet proposal. He resolutely exposed the various legalistic sophistries put forward by those who opposed inviting the legitimate representatives of China to attend the Political Committee meeting, and emphasized that the Soviet proposal complied with recognized international law standards and established practices of the United Nations.

Katz-Suchy asked the Political Committee to note the fact that the despicable representative of the Kuomintang clique currently attending the Political Committee meeting has no right to represent the great Chinese people. Katz-Suchy said: The only legitimate representative of China is the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. He firmly supported inviting the legitimate representatives of China to attend the Political Committee meeting; he declared that the Polish delegation would vote in favor of the Soviet proposal.

Ukrainian representative Baranovsky firmly advocated giving representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China the opportunity to express their opinions, provide evidence of U.S. aggression against China, and participate in the discussion when the Political Committee meets to discuss this issue. Baranovsky emphasized that the opinions of the Kuomintang elements currently attending this meeting should be ignored, because this pretender does not represent anyone and is illegally occupying the seat of the Chinese representative. In conclusion, Baranovsky said that his delegation fully supports the Soviet proposal and will vote in favor of it.

The representatives of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Bolivia opposed the Soviet proposal and put forward the absurd argument that if the Political Committee invites representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to attend the meeting, it would indicate recognition of this government.

Soviet representative Malik delivered a speech in response, once again explaining that the Soviet proposal did not mention the issue of recognizing the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. He said: The attitude of a government towards any country is a matter for each government and country itself. Malik said: However, when a committee of the United Nations is discussing the important international issue of war or peace and the matter of a legitimate representative of a major country participating in the discussion of this issue, the individual selfish considerations of the Nicaraguan government or other United Nations member states should be subordinate to the purposes and objectives of the United Nations, which is to strengthen peace, international security, and promote friendly relations between nations.

As the meeting was about to end, the Chilean representative said that he was prepared to propose an amendment to the Soviet proposal and proposed adjourning the meeting. The General Assembly announced the adjournment of the meeting based on this proposal.

　　马立克在会上发言坚主邀我代表参加
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社纽约二十五日讯：联合国大会政治委员会十一月二十四日上午开始讨论关于美国侵略中国的问题，这个问题在本届大会的议程上名为“苏联控诉美国侵略中国案”。
    苏联代表马立克在会议开始时发表演说，他追述苏联代表团曾于一九五○年十一月十五日向政治委员会提出一个提案，建议邀请中华人民共和国中央人民政府代表出席政治委员会会议，参加关于美国侵略中国问题的讨论。这个提案称：“由于大会第五届会议讨论‘苏联控诉美国侵略中国’问题，并鉴于中华人民共和国中央人民政府曾声明中华人民共和国代表应参加对上述问题的讨论，政治委员会兹特决议：邀请中华人民共和国中央人民政府代表参加政治委员会讨论‘苏联控诉美国侵略中国’问题的会议。”
    马立克说，苏联代表团提出这个提案时所根据的事实是：中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来奉中华人民共和国中央人民政府的命令曾经三度向联合国声明，要求由中华人民共和国的代表参加上述问题的讨论。
    马立克说，中华人民共和国政府的要求是有充分根据的，是合法的并且是正义的，苏联代表团希望政治委员会接受邀请中华人民共和国代表参加对这个问题的讨论的提案。
    国民党集团代表蒋廷黻反对苏联的提案，他又一次重复对中华人民共和国政府的司空见惯的诽谤。
    智利代表宣称，他不知道中华人民共和国政府曾经向联合国提出过要求，因此要求解释。
    苏联代表马立克发言。他说到中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部长周恩来于一九五○年十月十八日致大会主席的电报，要求邀请中华人民共和国中央人民政府代表参加联合国对于两个问题的讨论，这两个问题就是：美国侵略中国问题和美国飞机轰炸中国领土问题。
    马立克追述说：大会邀请与大会所讨论的问题直接有关的某一国家的代表参加讨论，并不是一件新的事情。例如，政治委员会就曾在一九四九年邀请意大利参加处理前意大利殖民地问题的讨论，特别政治委员会亦曾邀请外约旦代表参加巴勒斯坦问题的讨论。
    马立克接着追述说：九月下旬安全理事会曾通过决定，邀请中华人民共和国代表参加安全理事会议程上关于武装侵略台湾这一问题的讨论，现在中华人民共和国的代表已经到达纽约来参加讨论这个问题。马立克接着说：因此，政治委员会已有应当遵循的先例。邀请中华人民共和国代表参加目前这个问题的讨论的决定是合法的、是符合联合国宪章的，而且是完全公正的。应该特别强调指出：由于美国已经以其侵略朝鲜的政策而破坏了远东的和平，同时，也因侵入中国领土——台湾岛——而侵犯了中国的主权，并威胁了它的安全，美国侵略中国的问题就直接牵涉到国际和平与安全的问题。中国人民完全有权利控诉美国政府对中国的敌意行动和侵略，而且侵略正在逐日扩大。中华人民共和国中央人民政府代表之出席也是合理的，是有充分根据的，因为正是这个政府才有派代表出席联合国并参加联合国工作的全部合法权利和根据。
    白俄罗斯代表团团长基塞列夫支持苏联代表团的提案。基塞列夫说：中华人民共和国代表在讨论这个问题的时候出席乃是绝对必要的，因为这个问题直接影响到远东的和平与安全问题。捷克斯洛伐克代表哈奇杜也支持苏联提案。
    埃及代表拉法特硬说：安理会邀请中华人民共和国中央人民政府代表出席的决定并不为目前的情况构成先例，因为中华人民共和国不是争端的当事人。但是埃及代表宣称：他要到以后再表明他的最后的态度。
    马立克答复埃及代表的发言说：美国侵略中国问题以及美国飞机轰炸中国领土问题，都是在苏联代表团根据中华人民共和国中央人民政府的文件要求联合国大会列入议程的。马立克指出：所以要由苏联代表团建议将这些问题列入议程，是因为有一些代表——特别是美国代表——说：如果这些问题以中华人民共和国控诉案的方式提出，他们就将投票反对把它列入议程。鉴于这些问题的重要性，苏联代表团乃建议把这些问题当作苏联的控诉案提出。马立克说：然而，苏联代表团在总务委员会上说过，这两个问题实际上是中华人民共和国中央人民政府的控诉，这个政府实质上是原告。
    厄瓜多尔、澳大利亚和叙利亚代表在他们政府对中华人民共和国中央人民政府的态度方面作了若干的保留。但是他们仍然说：他们的代表团将投票赞成苏联提案，邀请中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表出席政治委员会的会议，就“控诉美国侵略中国案”陈述意见。
    波兰代表卡茨·苏琪也支持苏联的提案。他坚决地揭露了反对邀请中国的合法代表出席政治委员会会议的人们所提出的各种各样的法理上的诡辩，并着重指出苏联提案符合公认的国际法标准和联合国的既定惯例。
    卡茨·苏琪请政治委员会注意一件事实，即：目前出席政治委员会会议的卑鄙的国民党集团的代表无权代表伟大的中国人民。卡茨·苏琪说：中国的唯一合法的代表是中华人民共和国中央人民政府。他坚主邀请中国的合法代表出席政治委员会会议；他宣称：波兰代表团将投票赞成苏联提案。
    乌克兰代表巴拉诺夫斯基坚主给中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表以发表他们的意见，和提供美国侵略中国的证据，并在政治委员会开会讨论这个问题时参加讨论的机会。巴拉诺夫斯基着重指出：对目前出席这次会议的国民党分子关于这个问题的意见应该置之不理，因为这个僭夺名义的人并不代表任何人，他是非法占据着中国代表的席次的。巴拉诺夫斯基在结语中说：他的代表团完全支持苏联的提案，并将投票赞成它。
    古巴、尼加拉瓜和玻利维亚的代表反对苏联提案并提出荒唐的说法，说政治委员会如果邀请中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表出席会议，就会表示承认这个政府。
    苏联代表马立克对此发表演说，再度解释称：苏联提案并未提到承认中华人民共和国中央人民政府问题。他说：某一个政府对任何一个国家的态度是各该政府和国家自己的事情。马立克说：但是，当联合国的一个委员会讨论战争还是和平这个重要的国际问题和一个大国的合法代表参加讨论这一问题的事情时，尼加拉瓜政府或其他联合国会员国的个别自私的考虑就应该服从联合国的宗旨和目标，这就是加强和平、国际安全和促进各国间的友好关系。
    会议行将结束时，智利代表说：他准备对苏联提案提出修正案并提议休会。大会根据这个提议宣布休会。
