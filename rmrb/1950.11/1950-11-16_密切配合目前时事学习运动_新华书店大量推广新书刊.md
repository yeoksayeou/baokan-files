　　Closely Coordinate with the Current Affairs Learning Movement:
    Xinhua Bookstore Massively Promotes New Books and Periodicals
    The Xinhua Bookstore Beijing Branch has recently launched a book and periodical promotion campaign centered on resisting America and aiding Korea. All staff members unanimously believe that the bandit behavior of American imperialism in expanding its aggression in the Far East cannot be ignored. We must directly aid Korea, respond to the call at any time and any place, and fight to defeat the aggressors and defend our homeland's peace.
    In the work of book and periodical distribution, we must closely coordinate with the current affairs learning movement and universally deliver current affairs readings on resisting America, aiding Korea, and protecting peace to the broad masses of readers. Important readings arranged for promotion include periodicals such as "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy," "Current Affairs Handbook," "New Observer," "World Knowledge," and dozens of types of "Xinhua Current Affairs Compilations." In the retail department, the books and periodicals are introduced to readers using display windows and broadcasts. Readers have been extremely enthusiastic in recent days, and current affairs readings have become objects of eager purchase. Each time the "Current Affairs Handbook" is stocked, it is snapped up by readers. In terms of wholesale, the distribution network is expanded so that readers in all corners can learn from current affairs books and periodicals.
    A "Mobile Service Team" has also been established to tour theaters, cinemas, and public places to introduce and promote sales. On the 5th of this month, the mobile team was welcomed everywhere by the masses, and more than a thousand copies of current affairs learning books and periodicals were sold in one day. In various factories, the mobile team, through the trade union, deeply promoted and sold current affairs readings to the hands of the working masses. In schools, the learning materials were supplied to the broad masses of young people through students who served as promoters in each school. In total, more than 30,000 copies of current affairs readings have been sold in the past week, of which 15,000 copies of the "Current Affairs Handbook" have been sold.
    All staff members have voluntarily organized themselves during their spare time and unanimously expressed that they will closely align with political requirements, coordinate with the current affairs learning movement, and use and connect all social distribution forces to continue to promote readings on resisting America, aiding Korea, and protecting peace so that the broad masses of people can recognize the true face of American imperialism, this most dangerous enemy, to raise vigilance, strengthen unity, so as to crush its aggressive conspiracies and finally send it to the grave.

　　密切配合目前时事学习运动
    新华书店大量推广新书刊
    新华书店北京分店，最近以抗美援朝为中心，展开了书刊的宣传推广运动。全体工作人员一致认为：美帝国主义在远东扩大侵略的这种强盗行为，已不能置之不理，我们要直接地援助朝鲜，随时随地响应号召，为击溃侵略者捍卫祖国的和平而战斗。
    在书刊发行工作中，要密切的配合目前的时事学习运动，把抗美援朝保卫和平的时事读物普遍地送到广大读者的手里。布置宣传推广的重要读物有《争取持久和平争取人民民主》、《时事手册》、《新观察》、《世界知识》等几种刊物和《新华时事丛刊》数十种。在门市部利用橱窗、广播向读者介绍书刊，连日读者极为踊跃，时事读物成为争购的对象，“时事手册”每次进货，均为读者抢购一空。在批发方面，扩大发行网，使各角落读者都能学习到时事书刊。
    “流动服务队”亦已成立，巡回各剧院、电影院、公共场所介绍推销。本月五日，流动队到处受到群众的欢迎，一天内就售出时事学习的书刊千余册。在各工厂里，流动队通过了工会，把时事读物深入推销到工人群众的手里。在学校里，通过各校担任推销员的同学，供应了广大青年群众的学习读物。总计一周来时事读物共销三万册以上，其中《时事手册》已销到一万五千册。
    全体工作人员都自愿地在业余时间内组织起来，并一致表示要紧密切合政治要求，配合目前的时事学习运动，并运用与联系社会一切发行力量，把抗美援朝保卫和平的读物继续加以推广，使广大人民都认清美帝国主义这个最危险的敌人的真面目，来提高警惕，加紧团结，以便粉碎其侵略阴谋，并最后把它送进坟墓里去。
