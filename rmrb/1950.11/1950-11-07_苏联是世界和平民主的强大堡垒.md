　　The birth of the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics occurred thirty-three years ago today.
　　The victory of the October Revolution and the establishment of the proletarian regime in the Soviet Union have unparalleled and great worldwide historical significance. This revolution, as Stalin pointed out, "is not merely a 'national' revolution, it is first and foremost an international, world revolution, because it is a fundamental transformation in the history of all mankind from the old world of capitalism to the new world of socialism." The October Revolution overthrew the capitalist system in a country that accounts for one-sixth of the earth's surface, and enabled the proletariat to seize power, thus breaking the chains of imperialist domination of the world and greatly inspiring the exploited and oppressed people of all countries.
　　Thirty-three years of historical facts eloquently prove that the Soviet state created by Lenin and Stalin is the most progressive, most civilized, and most dynamic country in human history. For thirty-three years, the Soviet people, under the direct leadership of their great teachers Lenin and Stalin, have unselfishly struggled for the sacred cause of socialist construction in their motherland and peaceful cooperation in the international community, building this first country of the working people in human history into an invincible socialist fortress and a bulwark of peace and democracy. As a result of this fact, the Soviet state has today gained the enthusiastic support and sincere love of the working people all over the world.
　　The Soviet Union is powerful, first of all, because it implements the most thorough democracy in the economic and political life of the country. That is Soviet democracy, socialist democracy. This democracy is fully embodied in the great Stalin Constitution, and this Constitution serves as the foundation of the entire socio-political life of the Soviet people. Before the October Revolution, there had never been such a thorough democratic system in history as the Soviet system—a political system in which all people enjoy completely equal economic and political rights and have the opportunity to actively participate in state management and all social activities. This is 100% genuine democracy in the true sense of the word. It is absolutely opposed to the "democracy" that the imperialist bourgeoisie often puts on its lips today, using it to conceal its crimes of practicing fascism at home and colonial conquest abroad. Soviet democracy is real and thorough because it is based on the social ownership of all means of production and a system where no one exploits anyone. The vigorous vitality of this democratic system is fully demonstrated by the fact that 99.98% of all Soviet voters participated in the election of the Supreme Soviet this year.
　　At the same time, the Soviet Union is also powerful because all ethnic groups within its borders have consistently followed the revolutionary national policy of Lenin and Stalin and have achieved a steel-like unity. The Soviet state grants genuine freedom and equality to all ethnic groups within its borders, eradicates all causes of national oppression and racial enslavement, and creates all conditions conducive to the political, economic, and cultural development of all ethnic groups, thus forming a closely united multi-ethnic socialist family, the most consolidated and strongest Soviet state in the world today. The strength and vitality of this multi-ethnic state have been fully proven by the severe test of the Great Patriotic War against fascism.
　　The superiority of socialism over capitalism, its infinitely great creativity, is most evident in the brilliant achievements of the Soviet Union's post-war economic construction as it moves towards communism. Although it suffered more severe damage during World War II than other European countries, the Soviet Union recovered its economy more quickly than any other country after the war, and has already exceeded the pre-war production level by a large margin. In the third quarter of 1949, the total industrial output of the Soviet Union exceeded the same quarter of 1948 by 17%; in the third quarter of 1950, it exceeded the same quarter of 1949 by 24%; and the total industrial output in the first nine months of 1950 increased by 22% compared with the same period last year. While the capitalist world is constantly plagued by tens of millions of unemployed and the widespread impoverishment of the working people, the Soviet Union, which has eliminated unemployment for 20 years, has seen the number of its workers and staff increase by 1.8 million in 1949 compared to 1948, with the people's material and cultural living standards rising year by year; in the third quarter of 1950, it increased by another 2.4 million compared to the same quarter of 1949.
　　While the American imperialists are repeatedly adding to their military budgets for the despicable purpose of expanding aggression and dominating the world, stuffing the muzzles of cannons with 40 to 50 billion dollars of wealth and manufacturing human massacres, the socialist Soviet Union is repeatedly announcing its unprecedentedly great plans to transform nature for the happiness of thousands of generations of mankind. Not long ago, the Soviet Council of Ministers made a resolution on the construction of the world's largest Kuibyshev Hydropower Station (with a power generation capacity of 2 million kilowatts) and the Stalingrad Hydropower Station on the Volga River, and a resolution on the irrigation and water conservancy construction of the Turkmen Main Canal, Southern Ukraine, and Northern Crimea; in particular, the implementation of the magnificent plan to plant large-scale farmland shelterbelts to combat drought has achieved great success: by the spring of this year, in less than two years, a total of more than 1.6 million hectares of farmland shelterbelts had been planted, greatly exceeding the original plan.
　　The active implementation of this great Stalin plan to transform nature, the rapid development of the Soviet Union's economic construction in the post-war transition to communism, and the accelerated improvement of the Soviet people's living standards brought about by repeated cost reductions and price reductions—all these are sufficient to prove that the socialist state sincerely desires peace. These greatest constructions of modern times are a clear proof of the Soviet Union's thorough and firm policy of peace.
　　From here, a sharply contrasting picture appears before us: in the capitalist world controlled by the war-mongering groups, productive forces are either largely abandoned or destroyed, or largely stuffed into the muzzles of cannons; in the socialist Soviet Union, there is a leap in the progress of productive forces and a vigorous development of peaceful construction. In the capitalist world, due to the imperialists' frantic expansion of armaments and the Wall Street monopoly consortium's enthusiasm for wartime profiteering and rampant expansion of aggression, the prices of daily necessities have soared, and the lives of the broad masses of people have greatly deteriorated; in the socialist Soviet Union, due to the Soviet government's use of the largest part of its financial and material resources for economic and cultural construction (the budget for the Soviet Union's national economic and social and cultural construction in 1950 reached 285.1 billion rubles, accounting for two-thirds of the total expenditure budget, while the budget for national defense expenditure accounted for only 18.5% of the total budget), the happiness of the entire people's life has been raised to an unprecedented level of prosperity in human history. In short, capitalism is poverty and suffering, and socialism is happiness and joy. Imperialism is aggression and war, and socialism is freedom and peace.
　　The Soviet Union not only sincerely desires peace, not only expresses its desire for peace through huge construction, but also has carried out struggles at the cost of any sacrifice for the cause of world peace in practical actions with unyielding determination.
　　In World War II, the Soviet people, with their incomparably heroic struggle, defeated the main force of the Axis powers alone and won the victory against the fascists in the East and the West, thus making an unparalleled contribution to the cause of world peace. Because of this unprecedentedly great victory, the Soviet Union saved all mankind in the world, including the ruling groups of the United States, Britain, and France, from the threat of trampling, enslavement, and destruction by fascist bandits, thereby greatly consolidating world peace. Apart from a few inhuman war traffickers such as Truman, MacArthur, Dulles, Stassen, Churchill and their ilk, all mankind in the world is unanimously and infinitely grateful to the Soviet Union. Only because of this, it has gained the unprecedented respect and love of all peace-loving and freedom-loving people.
　　Just taking the fact that the Soviet Union alone defeated the military main force of the three fascist powers of Germany, Japan, and Italy, the strength of this socialist country is already amazing enough. However, today, the strength of socialist forces has increased much more than during the war and in the early post-war period.
　　One of the great results of World War II with world historical significance is the birth of the great People's Republic of China, the formation of six people's democratic countries in Central and Southeastern Europe, the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, and the victorious advance of the anti-imperialist struggles of the people of former colonies such as Korea, Vietnam, and Indonesia in Asia. The great People's Republic of China with a population of 475 million and the people's democratic countries in Central and Southeastern Europe with a population of 100 million have all completely broken free from the shackles of imperialism, and have carried out close cooperation with the Soviet Union and formed a fighting alliance. They are closely united around the Soviet Union, forming the core force of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. How big is this team? A large family of 800 million people!
　　Naturally, the entire world peace and democracy camp is much larger. This also includes the revolutionary proletariat and the broad masses of working people in capitalist countries who are fighting imperialism, as well as the colonial revolutionary people in Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaya, and other countries who are waging anti-imperialist wars. In total, the strength of the world's peace, democracy, and socialism camp has greatly exceeded that of the imperialist camp of war and aggression.
　　In response to the American imperialist robbers' frantic expansion of armaments, barbaric expansion of their war of aggression against the Korean people, continuous provocations against our new China, and active pursuit of their sinful plot to arm Japan and arm West Germany, in response to all these crimes of the American imperialists in creating a new war, the Soviet Union has continuously put forward sincere and practical peace proposals at the United Nations: banning the use of atomic bombs, universal arms reduction, concluding a five-power peace pact, peaceful settlement of the Korean dispute, etc.; on a worldwide scale, the Soviet Union is actively leading the movement to defend and consolidate peace, and the strength of this movement can be proven by the fact that the number of signatories to the Stockholm Peace Appeal has reached 500 million to date. Under the leadership of the Soviet Union, the convening of the Second World Peace Congress will inevitably push this sacred movement to a higher stage.
　　The most reliable guarantee of world peace is undoubtedly the mutual assistance and cooperation between the two great allied nations of China and the Soviet Union, including 700 million people. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution relied on the great inspiration of the Soviet October Revolution and the Soviet Union's consistent warm sympathy and help to the Chinese people since the October Revolution. At the same time, the revolutionary and victorious new China has given the Soviet people and the world peace, democracy, and socialism camp headed by the Soviet Union tremendous encouragement, and has greatly strengthened this camp. In the past year or so, our new China, where the people are "in charge," has made enormous progress in all aspects. Such rapid progress would be difficult to achieve without the help of the Soviet Union.
　　At a time when the American imperialist robbers are frantically expanding their war of aggression against Korea and are directly threatening the independent survival of new China from Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam, the alliance and mutual assistance between the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union has particularly important significance. Based on the experience of World War II and the Chinese People's Liberation War, the Soviet Red Army defeated 10 million Nazi troops with the strongest combat effectiveness in the capitalist world and more than 1 million stubborn Kwantung Army; the Chinese People's Liberation Army annihilated a total of more than 8 million Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops armed by American imperialism. The unity of these two great forces is the strongest guarantee of world peace.
　　At this time when peace-loving and democratic people all over the world are warmly celebrating the great festival of the Soviet October Revolution, let us shout:
　　Long live the friendly alliance and mutual assistance between the people of China and the Soviet Union!
　　Long live the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!

### 苏联是世界和平民主的强大堡垒

　　苏联是世界和平民主的强大堡垒
    伟大苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的诞生，到今天已经三十三周年了。
    十月革命的胜利，无产阶级政权在苏联的建立，是有无比伟大的全世界历史意义的。这一革命，正如斯大林所指示，“不单只是‘民族范围内的’革命，它首先就是国际性世界性的革命，因为它是全世界人类史中由资本主义旧世界进到社会主义新世界的根本转变”。十月革命在一个占全球地面六分之一的大国内，推翻了资本主义制度，使无产阶级取得了政权，这样就打断了帝国主义统治世界的锁链，大大地鼓舞了世界各国的被剥削者、被压迫者。
    三十三年的历史事实雄辩地证明了：列宁、斯大林所创造的苏维埃国家，乃是人类历史上最进步、最文明、最富有生命力的国家。三十三年来，苏联人民在其伟大导师列宁、斯大林的直接领导之下，一贯地为自己祖国的社会主义建设和国际间和平合作的神圣事业进行了忘我的斗争，把这人类历史上第一个劳动人民的国家建设成为强大无敌的社会主义的堡垒与和平民主的堡垒。由于这个事实，苏维埃国家在今天已得到了全世界劳动人民的热烈拥护和真挚敬爱。
    苏联之所以强有力，首先是因为它在国家的经济政治生活中实行了最彻底的民主。那就是苏维埃民主，社会主义的民主。这种民主完整地体现在伟大的斯大林宪法上，并以这一宪法作为苏联人民全部社会政治生活的基础。在十月革命以前，历史上从来不曾有过像苏维埃这样一种彻底民主的制度——全体人民都享有完全平等的经济政治权利，都享有积极参加国家管理和全部社会活动之机会的政治制度。这是百分之百名副其实的真民主。它跟今日帝国主义资产阶级时常挂在嘴上、用来掩蔽其对内实行法西斯、对外实行殖民地征服等罪行的“民主”，是绝对相反的。苏维埃民主所以是真实的、彻底的，因为它建立在一切生产手段的社会公有制和没有人剥削人的制度上。这种民主制度的生气勃勃的活力，在今年苏联全体选民中有百分之九九·九八参加了最高苏维埃的选举这一事实上，得到了充分的证明。
    同时，苏联之所以强有力，也由于它境内各民族一致遵奉着列宁、斯大林的革命的民族政策而实现了钢铁般坚强的团结。苏维埃国家赋予境内一切民族以真正的自由和平等，根绝了一切民族压迫和种族奴役的原因，更创造了一切有利于各民族政治、经济和文化发展的条件，因而形成了一个亲密团结的多民族的社会主义大家庭，一个当前世界上最巩固、最坚强的苏维埃国家。这个多民族国家的坚强而富有生命力，经过反法西斯的伟大卫国战争的严酷考验而得到了充分的证明。
    社会主义压倒资本主义的优越性，它的无限巨大的创造性，最显著地表现在走向共产主义的苏联战后经济建设的辉煌成就上。在二次大战期间虽然遭受了比欧洲其他国家更为严重的破坏，战后苏联却比任何他国更为迅速地恢复了自己的经济，并且已经超过战前的生产水平很多。一九四九年第三季苏联工业总生产量比一九四八年同季超过百分之十七；一九五○年第三季又比一九四九年同季超过百分之二十四；而一九五○年头九个月的工业总产量则比去年同期增加百分之二十二。当资本主义世界经常存在着整千万失业者和劳动人民普遍贫困化的时候，消灭失业已达二十年之久的苏联，在人民物质与文化生活水平逐年不断上升的情况之下，它的工人和职员的数目，一九四九年较一九四八年增加一百八十万人；一九五○年第三季又较一九四九年同季增加了二百四十万人。
    当美国帝国主义者为着扩大侵略、独霸世界的卑污目的而一次又一次地追加其军事预算，用四五百亿元的财富去填塞炮口，制造人类大屠杀的时候，社会主义的苏联却为着千百代人类的幸福而一次又一次地向全世界宣布其空前伟大的改造自然计划。不久以前，苏联部长会议作了关于伏尔加河上建设世界最大的古比雪夫水电站（发电量达二百万基罗瓦特）和斯大林格勒水电站的决议，关于土库曼大运河、南乌克兰和北克里米亚的灌溉与水利建设的决议；尤其是与抗旱作斗争的大规模植造农田防护林带这一雄伟计划的实施，已经获得了很大的成就：到今年春季为止，不到二年工夫，总共已植造了一百六十万公顷以上的农田防护林带，大大超过了原定的计划。
    这种伟大斯大林改造自然计划的积极执行，战后苏联向共产主义过渡的经济建设的飞跃发展，以及由再三的降低成本、降低物价所促成的苏联人民生活幸福的加速提高——这一切都足以证明社会主义国家是百分之百真诚地要求和平的。这些现代最伟大的建设，正是苏联彻底而坚定的和平政策的明证。
    从这里，出现着一幅尖锐对立的图景在我们面前：在战贩集团控制下的资本主义世界里，生产力不是大量地被荒弃或消毁，便是大量地被塞往炮口里去；在社会主义的苏联，却是生产力的飞跃进步，和平建设的猛烈发展。在资本主义世界里，由于帝国主义者疯狂扩充军备，由于华尔街垄断财团热中于战时暴利而狂猛扩大侵略，致使生活必需品价格猛涨，广大人民生活大大恶化；在社会主义的苏联，则由于苏维埃政府用最大部分的财力物力于经济文化的建设（一九五○年度苏联国民经济和社会文化建设的预算达二、八五一亿卢布，占全部岁出预算的三分之二，而国防经费的预算仅占全部预算的百分之十八·五），全体人民的生活幸福已被提高到了人类历史上空前未有的优裕程度。总括一句话：资本主义就是贫困、痛苦，社会主义就是幸福、愉快。帝国主义就是侵略与战争，社会主义就是自由与和平。
    苏联不仅真诚地要求和平，不仅用巨大的建设来表示和平意愿，而且它还在实际行动上不屈不挠地为着全世界的和平事业而进行了不惜任何牺牲的斗争。
    在第二次世界大战中，苏维埃人民以英勇无比的斗争，单独击溃了轴心国的主力，赢得了对东西方法西斯的胜利，以此作为他们对世界和平事业的无上贡献。由于这一空前伟大的胜利，苏联把全世界人类，包括美、英、法诸国的统治集团在内，从法西斯盗匪的蹂躏、奴役和毁灭的威胁中拯救了出来，因而大大地巩固了世界的和平。除少数失去了人性的战争贩子如杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟、杜勒斯、史塔生、邱吉尔及其同类外，全世界人类是一致无限感激苏联的。惟其如此，它才获得了一切爱好和平自由的各族人民前所未有的尊敬和热爱。
    仅仅拿苏联单独击溃德、日、意三个法西斯强国的军事主力这一事实来看，这个社会主义国家国力之强大，已尽足令人惊叹的了。然而今天社会主义力量之强大，又比大战时期和大战结束初期，增进得多多了。
    第二次大战的具有世界历史意义的伟大结果之一，就是伟大的中华人民共和国的诞生，中欧、东南欧六个人民民主国家的形成，德意志民主共和国的建立，及亚洲的朝鲜、越南、印尼等前殖民地人民反帝斗争的胜利进军。四亿七千五百万人口的伟大的中华人民共和国，和一亿人口的中欧和东南欧各人民民主国家，均已完全摆脱了帝国主义的羁绊，同苏联实行亲密的合作并结成战斗的同盟。它们紧密地团结在苏联的周围，形成了和平、民主和社会主义阵营的核心队伍。这队伍有多大呢？八万万人的大家庭！
    自然，整个世界和平民主阵营是更要广大得多的。这里还要包括正在跟帝国主义搏斗的资本主义各国的革命无产阶级和广大劳动人民，以及朝鲜、越南、印尼、菲律宾、马来亚等正在进行反帝战争的殖民地革命人民。总计起来，世界和平、民主与社会主义阵营的力量已经大大超过战争、侵略的帝国主义阵营。
    准对着美帝强盗的疯狂扩充军备、蛮横扩大其对朝鲜人民的侵略战争和向我新中国的不断挑衅、以及积极进行其武装日本、武装西德的罪恶阴谋，准对着美帝这一切制造新战争的罪行，苏联在联合国会场上不断地提出了真诚切实的和平建议：禁止使用原子弹、普遍裁减军备、订立五大国和平公约、和平解决朝鲜争端等；在全世界范围内苏联积极领导着保卫与巩固和平的运动，这一运动的强大可从斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上的签名者迄今已达五万万人这一事实上得到证明。在苏联领导之下，第二届世界拥护和平大会的召开势必将这一神圣的运动推进到更高的阶段。
    世界和平的最可靠的保证，无疑地是包括七万万人民的中苏两大盟邦的互助合作。中国人民革命的胜利是依靠着苏联十月革命的伟大启示和十月革命以来苏联一贯对中国人民的热烈同情和帮助。同时，革命胜利的新中国又给了苏联人民及以苏联为首的世界和平、民主与社会主义阵营以莫大的鼓舞，并且大大地加强了这一阵营。一年余来我们人民“当家”的新中国，在一切方面的进步都是非常巨大的。这样迅速的进步，没有苏联的帮助是很难达到的。
    当此美帝强盗疯狂扩大其侵略朝鲜的战争，并且正在从朝鲜、台湾、越南三方面来直接威胁着新中国的独立生存的时候，中苏两大国的同盟互助，有着特别重大的意义。依据第二次世界大战和中国人民解放战争中的经验，苏联红军击溃了一千万资本主义世界中战斗力最强的纳粹军和百余万顽强的关东军；中国人民解放军则前后总共歼灭了美帝所武装的蒋介石匪军八百余万。这两支伟大力量团结在一起，乃是世界和平的最坚强的保证。
    当此全世界爱好和平民主的人民热烈庆祝苏联十月革命的伟大节日之时，让我们高呼：
    中苏两国人民的友好同盟互助万岁！
    伟大的苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟万岁！
