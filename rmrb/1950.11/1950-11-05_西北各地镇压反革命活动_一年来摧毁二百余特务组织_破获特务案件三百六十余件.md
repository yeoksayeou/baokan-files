　　Northwest Regions Suppress Counter-Revolutionary Activities
    200+ Secret Agent Organizations Destroyed in the Past Year
    Over 360 Espionage Cases Cracked

    [Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 1st dispatch] The People's Public Security Organs and People's Public Security Forces in the Northwest region have achieved results in the work of suppressing counter-revolutionary activities in the past year. According to preliminary statistics: In the past year, a total of two hundred and five Kuomintang reactionary secret agent organizations - stations, groups, and teams - have been destroyed in various parts of the Northwest; a total of three hundred and sixty-eight espionage cases have been cracked, including more than fifty cases of counter-revolutionary conspiracies, riots, and rebellions. In addition, 6,249 important counter-revolutionary agents have been hunted down and subjected to control and re-education, 8,019 agents have been registered, and 175 radio stations have been seized.

    The characteristics of secret agent activities in the Northwest regions are: they use the complex ethnic composition of the Northwest and the ethnic estrangement caused by the reactionary rule of past generations to provoke relations between ethnic groups, spread rumors and incite, and collude with a small number of counter-revolutionary elements within the fraternal ethnic groups, and try their best to create ethnic disputes and undermine ethnic unity. At the same time, they systematically collude with bandits, reactionary military officers, and reactionary leaders of secret societies in various places to carry out sabotage activities such as spreading rumors, robbery, collecting intelligence, and launching riots. According to incomplete statistics, in April, May, and June of this year, a total of sixty-eight cases of reactionary slogans and leaflets spread by agents and many reactionary rumors were discovered in various parts of the Northwest.

    Currently, the public security departments in various parts of the Northwest are cooperating with the broad masses of people of all ethnic groups to carry out a mass anti-espionage and anti-rumor campaign in order to further eliminate the remaining secret agents.

　　西北各地镇压反革命活动
    一年来摧毁二百余特务组织
    破获特务案件三百六十余件
    【新华社西安一日电】西北地区的人民公安机关和人民公安部队，一年来在镇压反革命活动的工作上，取得了成绩。据初步统计：西北各地一年来共摧毁国民党反动派特务组织——站、组、队，共计二百零五个；共破获特务案件三百六十八件，内反革命阴谋暴动叛乱案五十余件。此外，并搜捕和管训了重要反革命特务分子六千二百四十九名，登记特务分子八千零一十九名，缴获电台一百七十五部。
    西北各地特务活动的特点，是利用西北民族复杂和历代反动统治所造成的民族隔阂，挑拨各民族间的关系，造谣煽惑，并勾结兄弟民族内部的少数反革命分子，极力制造民族纠纷，破坏民族团结。同时，有计划地勾结各地惯匪、反动军官和反动的会道门头子，进行造谣、抢劫、搜集情报、暴动等破坏活动。据不完全统计，今年四、五、六三个月内，西北各地先后发现特务散布的反动标语和传单六十八起，反动谣言多起。
    目前，西北各地公安部门正配合各民族广大人民群众力量，开展群众性的反特务反谣言运动，以便进一步肃清残余的特务分子。
