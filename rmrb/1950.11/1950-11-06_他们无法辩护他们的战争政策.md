Italian Communist Party Deputy General Secretary Longo

In a recent declaration on the domestic political situation, the leadership of the Italian Communist Party pointed out the complete failure of the Christian Democratic Party's attempts to isolate democratic forces and their leadership bodies, especially the Communist Party.

These efforts, undertaken by the Christian Democratic Party shortly after the American aggression in Korea at the behest of American imperialists, have completely gone bankrupt. They have been met with resolute opposition from communists, socialists, and loyal democrats; and with hostile attitudes and passive resistance from various strata of the bourgeoisie, particularly the middle classes, and those who have not yet determined their political stance, or even those who are hostile to communism and socialism.

The political struggle unfolded due to the American aggression in Korea has increased the concern and sympathy of some strata of the people towards the Communist Party, Socialists, and democrats who lead the Italian struggle for peace. This is evidenced by the fact that at the beginning of the American aggression in Korea, four million people signed the Stockholm Appeal; the lessons of the Korean event prompted a rapid increase in the number of signatures, reaching sixteen million by early September.

Suspicion and amazement at the government's blind obedience to the American imperialist aggression plans and interests have begun to appear in newspapers and articles by those who frequently express agreement with the opinions of government parties. A senator—a Christian Democrat—called on his colleagues and government officials (although with many reservations and contradictions in his appeal) "not to listen to the fatal opinion that conflict between East and West is inevitable," and believed that "Italy maintaining neutrality once armed conflict occurs" is possible.

Despite Italian public opinion favoring resolute actions to defend peace, and various strata least influenced by the Communist Party advocating a more cautious policy, less subservient to aggressive American plans, the Italian rulers refuse to reconsider their policies. On the contrary, the so-called "firm principles" of the Christian Democratic government's policy, formulated by D. Gasperi and Sforza, and used as instructions for the Italian representatives attending the New York Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers Conference, wholeheartedly and blindly supported the American government's actions "not only towards Korea, but also towards all countries" against which the American army might carry out aggression.

The authors of these "firm principles" play with hypocritical words in an attempt to deceive loyal readers. D. Gasperi and Sforza even attempted to portray the obligations imposed on its signatories by the Atlantic Treaty as Italy's obligations, with the aim of defending its own borders in the event of aggression. But all the facts and all the actions of the Gasperi government completely exposed the pacifist "defensive" mask of that government.

The obligations of the Atlantic Treaty have completely deprived Italy of the possibility of controlling its territory and the economic and military resources of the country. The ruling group is currently trying to achieve the automatic implementation of the Atlantic Treaty in order to deprive the Italian Parliament of the right, conferred by the Constitution, to decide on issues of war or peace.

In this situation, the Italian Communist Party issued a declaration, setting itself the task of exposing and condemning the war policy—the criminal, anti-people policy pursued by the Christian Democratic government in accordance with the interests of American imperialism. The declaration demanded that those responsible for this policy provide concrete evidence: to prove what kind of national interests force Italy to participate in the anti-Soviet military bloc; to prove why the Italian people should be dragged into the American aggression policy against the Asian people who are unwilling to be enslaved by the imperialists; to explain why they, like the fascists had done before, are willing to push Italy into another criminal war, while Italy is not threatened by any country, and its national interests do not require it to do so; to answer why Italy must retrace the path of armament and war preparation, that is, the path of new, inevitable economic and political degradation.

Finally, the declaration reiterated the question already raised by Comrade Togliatti: Has the Italian government really undertaken clear obligations? According to these obligations, and for the purpose of military provocation, the American army, according to the decision of the American government, enjoys the right to land on the islands and peninsula of Italy and use them as bases.

In fact, the Christian Democratic propagandists did not answer these clear and explicit questions, thus showing that they have nothing to defend the government's policy with. The Christian Democratic commentators were particularly indignant at a part of the Communist Party's declaration, in which every upright and sincere Italian—whether rich or poor, bourgeois or proletarian—is asked to reconsider the questions raised by the Communist Party leadership and the terrible consequences of the government's policy.

The task now prescribed for all communists—“to eliminate all remnants of sectarianism and all tendencies towards isolation, so that the hostility and passive resistance already existing in the middle class and various strata of the bourgeoisie can gradually recognize the necessity of opposing the government's policy and saving Italy from new disasters”—has aroused anger and confusion among our enemies, whose activities are aimed against the masses of the people. The agitation and anxiety shown by the Christian Democrats proves the value and national significance of the position taken by the Communist Party on the important issues of war and peace for all political tendencies and all classes of people.

When the answers given by the Christian Democratic propagandists to the clear questions raised in the Communist Party's declaration were proven to be meaningless and absurd, they shamelessly attempted to defend the government's anti-Soviet policy, evasively mentioning the Soviet Union's "violent policy" towards Italy since the signing of the peace treaty, and pleading for their fabricated threat from the Soviet Union to Italy's security. Undeniable facts prove the opposite. These facts prove that it is the United States and Britain that have adopted violent policies towards our people, they prove that only the American imperialists have maintained occupation forces in Trieste and have threatened our country's security and independence with their policy of dragging Italy into war and provocation.

One might ask, under these circumstances, how can the Italian rulers justify their aggressive policy towards the peace-loving Soviet Union, while acting as lackeys and flattering the United States? The Italian people should remember the American bombing of towns, atrocities, looting, and constant encroachment on their freedom and independence.

The Christian Democratic leaders are trying to make up for their lack of concrete evidence by restricting the right to criticize and oppose their policies, by launching a slanderous and provocative campaign against the so-called "fifth column," and threatening to restore armed forces of the fascist type; this also acknowledges their own mistakes and their inability to solve today's national problems in a democratic way. But the vigilance of the Communist Party, the effective actions of the broad masses throughout Italy who are concerned with defending peace and the country's future, will not allow the Christian Democratic rulers and their accomplices, after the painful experience of fascist rule, to drag Italy into a new tragedy again, into the war gamble of American imperialism.

### 他们无法辩护他们的战争政策

　　他们无法辩护他们的战争政策
    意大利共产党副总书记朗哥
    意大利共产党领导机构在最近发表的关于国内政治局势的宣言中，指出了基督教民主党企图孤立民主力量和它们的领导机构、尤其是共产党的努力的彻底失败。
    基督教民主党在美国侵略朝鲜之后不久即奉美国帝国主义者之命所进行的这些努力，已彻底破产了。他们遭到了共产党人，社会党人和忠实的民主分子的坚决反对；遭到了资产阶级各阶层，特别是中间阶层的人民以及那些尚未确定政治立场，甚至是敌视共产主义和社会主义的人们的敌对态度与消极抵抗。
    由于美国侵略朝鲜而展开的政治斗争，又增加了一些阶层的人民对领导意大利的和平斗争的共产党人，社会党人及民主人士的关怀和同情。这从下面的事实可以得到证明：美国侵略朝鲜的初期，有四百万人在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名；朝鲜事件的教训促使签名人数迅速增加，到九月初签名人数已达一千六百万。
    对于政府之盲目使意大利服从美帝国主义的侵略计划和利益的政策的怀疑与惊异，已开始在报纸和那些经常表示赞同各政府党意见的人们的文章中出现。某参议员——一位基督教民主党人——呼吁他的同僚与政府人士（虽然在其呼吁中有许多保留和矛盾），“不要听信东方与西方之间的冲突不可避免的致命意见”，并相信“一旦发生武装冲突，意大利保持中立”是可能的。
    尽管意大利的舆论赞成坚决保卫和平的行动，而且那些最不受共产党影响的各个阶层也主张采取较谨慎的、少屈从于侵略性的美国计划的政策，但意大利的统治者们却拒绝重新考虑他们的政策。相反地，由Ｄ·加斯贝利与史佛卓所制定，而且也就是用来作为出席纽约各大西洋公约国家外长会议的意大利代表的指示的、所谓基督教民主党政府政策的“坚定原则”，却全心全意而盲目地支持美国政府“不仅对于朝鲜，而且也是对于所有国家”的行动。对于这些国家，美国军队都有可能对之进行侵略。
    这些“坚定原则”的作者们玩弄一些伪善的词句以图迷惑忠实的读者。Ｄ·加斯贝利与史佛卓甚至企图将大西洋公约所加于其签字国的义务说成是意大利的义务，目的只是在一旦发生侵略时保卫它自己的边疆。但所有事实及加斯贝利政府的一切行动都完全地揭露了该政府的和平主义的“防御”的假面具。
    大西洋公约的义务业已使意大利完全没有了控制其领土与国家的经济和军事资源的可能。统治集团目前正力图取得大西洋公约的自动实行，以便剥夺意大利议会由宪法所赋与的决定战争或和平问题的权利。
    在这种形势下，意大利共产党发表了宣言，为自己订下了揭露与谴责战争政策——基督教民主党政府按照美帝国主义的利益所奉行的罪恶的反人民的政策——的任务。该宣言要求对这一政策负责的人们提出具体证据：要求他们证明是什么样的民族利益强迫意大利参加反苏军事集团；证明为什么意大利人民应该被卷入美国对那些不愿再受帝国主义者奴役的亚洲人民的侵略政策；要他们说明为什么他们像法西斯主义者以前所曾做过的那样愿意把意大利推入另一次的罪恶战争里，而意大利并没有受到任何国家的威胁，它的民族利益也不要求它这样做；要他们回答为什么意大利必须重踏整军备战的道路，也就是新的无可避免的经济和政治退化的道路。
    最后，该宣言重申托里亚蒂同志已经提出的问题：意大利政府真的已承担起明确的义务了吗？根据这种义务以及为着军事挑衅的目的，美国军队根据美国政府的决定享有在意大利各岛与半岛登陆，并使用它们为基地的权利。
    事实上，基督教民主党的宣传家们没有回答这些清楚而明确的问题，因此显示他们没有话来替政府的政策辩解。基督教民主党的评论家们对共产党宣言中的一部分特别感到忿怒，在那一部分中，要求每一个正直而诚挚的意大利人——不论贫富，资产阶级或无产阶级——再三考虑共产党领导机构所提出的问题以及政府政策的可怕后果。
    现在为所有共产党人规定的任务——“消除一切宗派主义的残余与一切孤立倾向，以使中间阶级和资产阶级各阶层中已存在着的敌视和消极抵抗，逐渐认识到反对政府政策及拯救意大利免于新灾难的必要性”——已在以反对人民大众为其活动目的的我们的敌人中间引起忿怒和混乱。基督教民主党人表现的激动和焦虑，证明了共产党在战争与和平的重要问题上所采取的立场对一切政治倾向和一切阶级人民的价值与全国性的重大意义。
    当基督教民主党的宣传家们对共产党宣言中提出的明确问题所作的答复被证明了是无意义和荒谬的时候，他们就厚颜无耻地企图为政府的反苏政策辩解，支吾其词的说什么自签订和约以来、苏联对于意大利的“强暴政策”，并求告于他们所捏造的苏联对意大利安全的威胁。无可争辩的事实证明适得其反。这些事实证明是美英对我们的人民采取了强暴政策，它们证明只是美帝国主义者在的里雅斯特保持了占领军以及把意大利卷进战争与挑衅的政策，从而才威胁了我国的安全与独立。
    人们会问，在这些情况下，意大利统治者怎样能够辩解他们对于爱好和平的苏联的侵略政策，同时并充当走狗和谄媚美国呢？意大利人民应当记得美国对城镇的轰炸，暴行，掠夺与不断地侵略他们的自由和独立。
    基督教民主党领袖们正力图以限制批评和反对他们政策的权利，以发动一个对付所谓“第五纵队”的诽谤和挑衅运动，及威胁着要恢复法西斯型的武装部队等来补充其具体证据的不足。同时也承认了他们自己的错误和对于以民主方式解决今日的全国性问题的无能。但是共产党的警觉，全意大利关心保卫和平与国家前途的广大群众的有效行动，都不会允许基督教民主党统治者及其帮凶，在法西斯统治的惨痛经验之后，又把意大利卷入一个新的悲剧里，卷入美帝国主义的战争赌博里。
