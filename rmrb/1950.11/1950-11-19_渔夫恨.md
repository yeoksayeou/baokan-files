　　Editor's Note: This drum ballad is based on a fact of American imperialist atrocities. It is written with great emotion and is worth recommending to the performing arts community.

　　The Yalu River water rolls in white waves,
　　Rushing down from Changbai Mountain,
　　Surging ten thousand feet out of the deep valley,
　　Meandering thousands of miles to the sea,
　　Layers of green mountains embrace the green water,
　　Bays of green water surround the green mountains,
　　The scenery of green mountains and clear water is beautiful,
　　Fishing boats come and go in the heart of the river.

　　There is a fisherman named Wu Chunhan,
　　Who has lived by the river for generations,
　　Backed by mountains and facing water,
　　He has a home in Heping Village.

　　His family includes an eighty-year-old mother,
　　His wife, Wu Dasao, is diligent and thrifty,
　　His young son is just two years old,
　　And his fifteen-year-old daughter is called Yuhuan.

　　Let's not talk about the past suffering,
　　Life has been infinitely happy since liberation;
　　They were allocated two days of black land,
　　And a fishing boat.

　　Wu Dasao works in the fields,
　　Chunhan fishes in the river,
　　Although Yuhuan is young,
　　She can fish and farm.

　　Spring planting and autumn harvest are hard work,
　　Through wind and rain without rest,
　　The whole family works together,
　　And their life is thriving.

　　One day, Chunhan got up early,
　　Repairing fishing nets in front of the door,
　　The golden sun shines on the horizon,
　　And a gentle breeze blows softly,
　　Chunhan was secretly delighted,
　　Today's fishing will be a good day again.

　　Yuhuan walked out of the house,
　　Calling out, "Daddy, have breakfast;
　　Mom made white flour dumplings,
　　Thin skin, big filling and fresh,
　t repair it too late after eating,
　t let the dumplings get cold."

　　Chunhan laughed when he heard this:
　　"You are too greedy, girl,
　　Dad has to hurry up and mend the fishing net,
　　After eating, the two of us will go on the boat."

　　After speaking, he went into the house to eat,
　　And filled a plate with fragrant dumplings,
　　After the whole family had eaten,
　　Father and daughter left home to fish.

　　Wu Dasao then said:
　　"Please come back early."
　　The old lady exhorted from the side:
　　"Be careful of the wind and waves, and steer the boat slowly."
　　The little boy shouted repeatedly:
　　"Dad, catch a big fish for me to play with."

　　Father and daughter walked out quickly,
　　Unconsciously came to the Yalu River.

　　But I saw, mountains next to mountains, water connected to water,
　　Water hitting mountain rocks and waves turning over,
　　Smoke and clouds filled the river,
　　White sails dotted among the clouds,
　　Pairs of fishing boats shuttling through,
　　Red flags fluttering on the masts.

　　The workers boarded the boats one after another,
　　Weighed anchor and set sail away from the river,
　　Oars cutting through layers of waves,
　　Bamboo poles pointing over the rocky滩.

　　Chunhan cast the net at the bow of the boat,
　　Yuhuan steered at the stern,
　　Lightly casting the net and pulling the line tightly,
　　Shiny fish were pulled onto the boat.

　　One net, two nets, three or four nets...
　　Every fish filled the cabin.

　　Chunhan smiled and called Yuhuan:
　　"This year is different from the past;
　　In the past, fishing was in vain,
　　Fishing tax and boat rent were never finished.
　　Now fishing belongs to us,
　　And the government can help us.
　　As long as we work hard,
　　Better days are yet to come."

　　Yuhuan smiled happily:
　　"These kind of days will never end,
　　I love this fishing boat and fishing net,
　　I love these mountains and rivers and farmland,
　　I love our hard-working and brave people,
　　I love our infinitely strong motherland,
　　I hope our days will get better every day,
　　I hope our peaceful life will last forever."

　　Father and daughter became more and more happy as they talked,
　　A fishing boat came towards them,
　　Liu Erhu was sitting at the bow of the boat,
　　Xiao Wangsan was standing at the stern,
　　When they met, they all smiled,
　　And chatted happily.

　　Talking and laughing, it was getting late,
　　A round of red sun hung over the western mountains,
　　The river's heart was red with colorful clouds,
　　Smoke rose from the fishing villages on both banks,
　　Heading towards the shore,
　　The sound of boats was accompanied by songs.

　　Yuhuan steered the stern steadily,
　　Chunhan pulled the sail tightly at the bow,
　　Father and daughter were happy and smiling,
　　And the fish they caught filled the boat.

　　Who knew that disaster would fall from the sky,
　　Suddenly hearing a buzzing sound shaking the sky,
　　The two hurriedly looked up,
　　Four planes were in the sky,
　　Spreading eight large wings,
　　Flying straight towards the small fishing boat,
　　With white stars and blue lines on the wings,
　　It was clearly an American plane in front of them.

　　Yuhuan panicked when she saw it,
　　And ran into Chunhan's arms,
　　"Daddy, Daddy, I'm scared,
　　I'm afraid it will drop bombs on us."

　　Chunhan hugged his daughter Yuhuan,
　　Pointing at the American plane with anger,
　　"The bold American imperialists are too wild,
　　What are you doing flying to China?
　　Child, child, don't be afraid,
　　We have the national flag hanging on the mast,
　　We are Chinese people,
　　They dare not bully us too much."

　　Before he finished speaking, the machine gun fired,
　　And blood splashed on the Yalu River,
　　Chunhan was hit by three bullets all over his body,
　　Yuhuan's left leg was pierced by a bullet,
　　Father and daughter both fell down,
　　Struggling for a while and then stopped moving.

　　In an instant, the fishing boat was stained with blood,
　　Droplets flowed into the river.

　　The injured boat leaked water,
　　Stopping in the river and spinning around.

　　The American plane, after brutally committing the crime,
　　Fleeting away smugly into the sky.

　　A gust of river wind brushed over their faces,
　　Wu Yuhuan was awakened on the boat,
　　She saw her father face down,
　　Lying next to her without moving,
　　And hastily called out, "Daddy,
　　My child is injured and cannot steer the boat.
　　Daddy, quickly bring the boat to shore,
　　Move the child to the shore..."

　　She called several times without an answer,
　　In a panic, she moved his face to see his appearance,
　　She saw his face covered with blood,
　　And a bullet pierced his brow bone,
　　She pressed her father's face with her left hand,
　　And tore off her white shirt with her right hand,
　　Wiping it hard but could not wipe it clean,
　　Wrapping it horizontally and vertically but not tightly.

　　"Daddy, Daddy, wake up,
　　My heart feels like it's being cut by a knife!
　　Why are you closing your eyes so tightly?
　　Why are you clenching your teeth so tightly?
　t you have hatred in your heart,
　　Hating the American imperialists for being too cruel,
　　We must avenge hatred and revenge,
　　Why don't you say a word?
　　Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!
　　Are you dying and staining the Yellow Springs!
　　Who will take care of grandma if you leave her,
　　Who will take care of mom if you leave her,
　　Who will raise my little brother if you leave him,
　　Who will pity your children if you leave them!
　　You can no longer mend fishing nets in front of the door,
　　You can no longer steer the boat on the river,
　　You can no longer cast nets to catch fish,
　　You can no longer have a big family reunion!"

　　Crying and shouting, her legs were in pain again,
　　Suddenly she fainted and her eyes rolled back.

　　At this time, the sun was setting on the riverside,
　　And the wind was blowing cold on the water,
　　The small boat drifted aimlessly with the water,
　　And was about to sink into the river.

　　Suddenly there was a sound of shouting,
　　A fishing boat came up from the water,
　　It was Wang San and Liu Erhu,
　　Rescuing the small boat to the riverbank.

　　They carried the father and daughter ashore,
　　And placed them on the sandy beach on the riverbank,
　　They whispered to Yuhuan,
　　Awakening Wu Yuhuan on the beach,
　　Opening her eyes to look carefully,
　　She saw everyone gathered around,
　　Liu Erhu was sitting on the left,
　　Xiao Wangsan was standing on the right,
　　Neighbors from left and right all came to see,
　　There were women and men.

　　Yuhuan hurriedly called out:
　　"Quickly save my daddy on the fishing boat."
　　Wang San said from the side:
　　"Your daddy is right next to you..."

　　Just as he was speaking, someone shouted:
　　Calling Yuhuan repeatedly,
　　Wu Dasao rushed out of the crowd,
　　Holding Yuhuan with tears streaming down her face.

　　Yuhuan repeatedly called out to her mother:
　　"American planes bullied us,
　　My daughter's left leg was injured,
　　And Daddy's life is not guaranteed..."

　　Wu Dasao heard the tragic voice:
　　Calling out to her husband and then to Yuhuan,
　　"I only hoped you would return early from fishing,
　　But who knew you would encounter disaster on the river,
　　The injured are injured, and the dead are dead,
　　My heart feels like it's being fried in hot oil!"

　　Mother and daughter were crying in each other's arms,
　　An old woman came from afar,
　　Wu old lady was more than eighty years old,
　　And came to the riverbank with a cane,
　　But seeing an old and a young,
　　One dead and one injured lying on the beach,
　　Holding her son's corpse with tears in her eyes,
　　Holding her granddaughter's hand with tears streaming down,
　　"Who injured my granddaughter,
　　Who harmed my son,
　　Leaving an old and a young family,
　　Orphans and widows are really pitiful!"

　　The Wu family wailed together,
　　And the fishermen wiped their tears endlessly,
　　They cried until the sky was dark and the earth was dim,
　　They cried until the wind howled and the water sobbed,
　　Liu Erhu shouted angrily at the sky with tears in his eyes,
　　Repeatedly cursing the American imperialists:
　　"It is often said that imperialists are like beasts,
　　But you are more ferocious than beasts!
　　Why did you kill my partner?
　　Why did you destroy the small fishing boat?
　　We must remember this blood debt,
　　And the American imperialists must repay it!"

　　Everyone nodded when they heard this,
　　Cursing the American imperialists for being dogs,
　　Sincerely trying to disrupt us,
　　Making our good days unsafe.

　　They all advised the old woman to stop crying,
　　And said the responsibility of revenge rests on everyone.
　　The brutality of the American imperialists is not just this one thing,
　　The great righteousness of national security is as heavy as a mountain.

　　Everyone stood by the river,
　　And swore facing the river:
　　This one said:
　　"I want to go to the United States to find the army,
　　Volunteer to fight in Korea."
　　Some said:
　　"Even if I don't go to Korea,
　　I am willing to donate grain and money to support it."

　　The angry tide surged on the Yalu River,
　　And the sound shook the sky.

　　Later, everyone fulfilled their wishes,
　　And took action to aid Korea.

专栏：

　　渔夫恨  王明希
    编者按：这一段鼓词是根据美帝暴行的一个事实作成的，写得很有感情，值得向曲艺界推荐。
    鸭绿江水白浪翻，
    滚滚奔下长白山，
    澎湃万丈出深谷，
    蜿蜒千里通海边，
    重重青山抱绿水，
    湾湾绿水绕青山，
    青山绿水风光好，
    江心来往打渔船。
    有个渔民吴春汉，
    祖祖辈辈住江边，
    北靠山来南临水，
    和平村里有家园。
    家有八旬高堂母，
    吴大嫂勤俭正当年，
    小儿年刚两周岁，
    姑娘十五叫玉环。
    过去的苦处且不表，
    解放后日子乐无边；
    分了两天黑土地，
    还有一艘打渔船。
    吴大嫂田里把活干，
    春汉打渔在江边，
    别看玉环年纪小，
    又会打渔又会种田。
    春种秋收多辛苦，
    风里雨里不消闲，
    一家老少齐劳动，
    小日子过的热火朝天。
    这一日春汉清晨起，
    修补渔网在门前，
    金色太阳天边照，
    和风吹来软绵绵，
    春汉心中暗欢喜，
    今日打渔又是好天。
    屋里走出玉环女，
    叫声“爹爹用早餐；
    妈妈包的白面饺子，
    皮薄个大馅儿鲜，
    吃完饭修理也不晚，
    不要让饺子冷成一团。”
    春汉闻听哈哈笑：
    “你这丫头嘴太馋，
    爹要赶快补渔网，
    吃完饭爷俩好上船。”
    说罢进屋把饭用，
    香喷喷的饺子盛满盘，
    全家老少吃过饭，
    父女打渔离家园。
    吴大嫂随后开言道：
    “请你们早去早回还。”
    老太太一旁紧嘱咐：
    “小心风浪慢驶船。”
    小儿一旁连声喊：
    “爹呀，打条大鱼给我玩。”
    父女出门走的快，
    不觉来到鸭绿江边。
    但只见，山靠山来水连水，
    水打山石浪花翻，
    烟云弥漫满江面，
    白帆朵朵插云间，
    渔船对对穿梭过，
    红旗飘飘挂在桅杆。
    工人纷纷把船上，
    拔锚扬帆离江边，
    木桨划开层层浪，
    竹篙点过乱石滩。
    春汉船头把网撒，
    玉环掌舵在后边，
    轻撒网来紧拉线，
    光闪闪的鱼儿拉上船。
    一网两网三四网……
    尾尾鲜鱼满舱间。
    春汉含笑把玉环叫：
    “往年如今不一般；
    往年打渔白辛苦，
    渔税船租拿不完。
    如今打渔归自己，
    政府还能帮助咱。
    只要咱们努力，
    更好的日月还在后边。”
    玉环一旁开颜笑：
    “这样的日子永远过不完，
    我爱这渔船和渔网，
    我爱这山水和庄田，
    我爱咱人民勤劳勇敢，
    我爱咱祖国强大无边，
    我愿咱日子天天好下去，
    我愿咱和平生活万万年。”
    父女越谈越高兴，
    迎面来一渔船，
    船头坐的刘二虎，
    船尾站着小王三，
    双方一见都含笑，
    嘻嘻哈哈把话谈。
    说笑不觉天已晚，
    一轮红日挂西山，
    江心彩云红成一片，
    两岸渔村冒炊烟，
    头朝着岸头进，
    船声伴着歌声喧。
    玉环船尾稳把舵，
    春汉船头紧拉帆，
    父女心欢面含笑，
    打来的鱼儿载满船。
    谁知大祸从天降，
    忽听嗡嗡声震天，
    二人急忙抬头看，
    四架飞机在天边，
    张着八个大翅膀，
    一直扑向小渔船，
    翅上有白星和蓝线，
    分明是美机到眼前。
    玉环一见心慌乱，
    跑到春汉怀里边，
    “爹爹爹爹我害怕，
    我怕它对咱扔炸弹。”
    春汉抱住玉环女，
    手指美机怒冲天，
    “大胆的美帝太撒野,
    飞到我中国为那般？
    孩子孩子别害怕，
    咱有国旗挂在桅杆，
    我们本是中国人，
    大量他不能欺负咱。”
    一言未了机枪响，
    鸭绿江上血花翻，
    春汉全身中三弹，
    玉环左腿被弹穿，
    父女双双倒下去，
    一阵挣扎不动弹。
    一霎时渔船鲜血染，
    点点流到江里边。
    负伤的船儿底漏水，
    停在江中打转转。
    美机残暴行凶后，
    洋洋得意窜往天边。
    阵阵江风拂面过，
    船上吹醒吴玉环，
    只见她爹爹脸朝下，
    爬在她身旁不动弹，
    开言忙把爹爹叫：
    “孩儿我受伤不能撑船。
    叫爹爹快把船靠岸，
    把儿挪到岸上边……”
    连喊几声不答应，
    急慌忙搬开脸面看容颜，
    只见那鲜血染满面，
    眉梁骨上被弹穿，
    左手按住爹爹脸，
    右手扯下白布衫，
    紧擦慢擦擦不净，
    横包竖包包不严。
    “爹爹爹爹醒醒吧，
    女儿心里似刀剜！
    为什么你紧紧闭着眼？
    为什么你紧紧咬牙关？
    莫不是你有心头恨，
    恨得是美帝太凶残，
    有恨有仇咱得报，
    一言不发为那般？
    爹爹爹爹爹爹呀！
    莫不是你一命染黄泉！
    你丢下奶奶谁孝敬，
    你丢下妈妈谁照看，
    你丢下弟弟谁抚养，
    你丢下儿女谁可怜！
    再不能门前补渔网，
    再不能江上来撑船，
    再不能撒网把渔打，
    再不能阖家大团圆！”
    又哭又喊腿又痛，
    忽然晕倒两眼翻天。
    这时间，江边日落沉沉暮，
    水面风来阵阵寒，
    小船悠悠随水转，
    眼看沉入江里边。
    忽然之间人声喊，
    水上来了一渔船，
    来的是王三刘二虎，
    打救这小船到江边。
    将他父女抬上岸，
    放在江岸大沙滩，
    他二人对着玉环低声唤，
    沙滩上唤醒吴玉环，
    睁开眼睛仔细看，
    看见众人围在身边，
    左边坐的刘二虎，
    右边站着小王三，
    左邻右舍都来看，
    又有女来又有男。
    玉环急忙来呼唤：
    “快救我爹爹在渔船。”
    王三一旁开言道：
    “你爹就在你身边……”
    正说之间有人喊：
    口口声声叫玉环，
    人丛里窜进吴大嫂，
    抱住玉环泪涟涟。
    玉环连把妈妈叫：
    “美国飞机欺侮咱，
    女儿左腿被打坏，
    爹爹性命不保全……”
    吴大嫂闻听声凄惨：
    叫一声丈夫又叫玉环，
    “只望你打渔早回转，
    又谁知江上遇灾难，
    伤的伤来死的死，
    我心好似滚油煎！”
    母女正在抱头哭，
    远处来了一老年，
    吴老太太八十多岁，
    拄着拐棍来到江边，
    但见一老和一少，
    一死一伤躺在沙滩，
    怀抱儿尸眼含泪，
    手拉孙女泪涟涟，
    “是谁打了我孙女，
    是谁害了我儿男，
    剩下一家老和少，
    孤儿寡母实可怜！”
    吴家老少齐痛哭，
    众渔民眼泪擦不干，
    只哭得天昏地又暗，
    只哭得风号水呜咽，
    刘二虎含泪冲天怒，
    连把美帝骂几番：
    “常言说，帝国主义如野兽，
    你比野兽更凶残！
    为什么打死我的伙伴？
    为什么打坏小渔船？
    这笔血债要记住，
    定要美帝来偿还！”
    大家一听把头点，
    齐骂美帝狗心肝，
    诚心和咱来捣乱，
    害得咱好日子不安全。
    齐劝大娘且住哭，
    报仇的责任大家担。
    美帝的凶残不止这一件，
    民族安危大义重如山。
    众人纷纷江边站，
    面对江水把誓宣：
    这个说：
    “我要去找美军去，
    志愿作战到朝鲜。”
    有的说：
    “我纵不到朝鲜去，
    也情愿捐粮助款来支援。”
    鸭绿江上怒潮涌，
    排山倒海声震天。
    到后来，各人遂了各人愿，
    行动起来援助朝鲜。
