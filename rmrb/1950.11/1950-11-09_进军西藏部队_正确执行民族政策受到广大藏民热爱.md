Xinhua News Agency, Kangzang Front, 5th: The People's Liberation Army marching into Tibet is correctly implementing the Central People's Government's ethnic policies, receiving the heartfelt welcome and love of Tibetans along the way.

As early as May of this year, after a unit of the PLA was stationed in northern Xikang, it convened symposiums in various places for Tibetan compatriots, lamas, and Tusi officials to widely publicize ethnic policies. In practical actions, they respected Tibetan compatriots' freedom of religious belief, protected temples, and helped Tibetan compatriots with harvesting, carrying water, collecting firewood, cutting grass, and treating illnesses. The hygiene team of a certain unit alone provided free medical treatment to more than two hundred Tibetan compatriots in the vicinity of their station. In June, PLA commanders and fighters passing through northern Kang made efforts to learn Tibetan and ate more tsampa, ghee, and milk, the Tibetan staple foods, in order to integrate with the Tibetan people in their daily lives. During the march across the Jinsha River towards Qamdo, the PLA continued to help Tibetans in newly liberated areas with the autumn harvest, or held joint celebrations with local Tibetan compatriots and representatives of the monks. After the PLA liberating Yanjing held joint celebrations with local Tibetan compatriots and monks' representatives, more than eighty "militiamen" hiding in the mountains voluntarily returned.

The broad masses of Tibetan people warmly welcomed their liberators. When a certain unit of the PLA passed through the territory of Ningjing County, Tibetan villagers from various villages came one after another with wheat cakes, walnuts, and ghee to express their regards. Along the banks of the Lancang River, in the villages on the mountains, Tibetan compatriots lit bonfires in every household according to Tibetan customs, and men, women, old and young, stood by the roadside, applauding and welcoming the PLA. Four headmen from A'cuo Village in southern Chaya County, representing three hundred Tibetan households and more than three hundred lamas from six Lama temples, traveled for three days on horseback to present gifts and pay their respects to the PLA. They also requested some slogans in both Chinese and Tibetan of the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention to take back and widely publicize. Along the Yaqu River, the upper reaches of the Lancang River on the Qingkang border, Tibetan compatriots helped the PLA cross the river with leather rafts, while women carried tea buckets to fill the soldiers' bowls with tea. The soldiers also warmly reciprocated with sugar and cigarettes. Tibetan compatriots in Ganzi, Dege, Luhuo, Daofu, Dengke, Zhanhua, Shiqu and other places in northern Kang drove hundreds and thousands of yaks to help transport the PLA's supplies across the Jinsha River. The Lamas of Ganzi Monastery also paid their respects to the PLA by dancing lion dances and wild yak dances, and prayed for the health of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu.

    【新华社康藏前线五日电】向西藏进军的人民解放军正确地执行中央人民政府的民族政策，得到沿途藏民的衷心欢迎和爱戴。
    还在今年五月间，解放军一部进驻西康北部后，即在各地召开藏胞、喇嘛、土司等座谈会，广泛宣传民族政策，并在实际行动中尊重藏胞的宗教信仰自由、保护寺庙与帮助藏胞收割、背水、打柴、割草和治病。仅某部卫生队即在驻地附近免费医治了二百余名藏胞的疾病。六月间路过康北的另部解放军指战员努力学习藏语，多吃糌粑、酥油、牛奶的藏胞饭食，以便在生活上和藏胞打成一片。解放军渡过金沙江向昌都进军途中，继续帮助新解放地区藏胞秋收，或与当地藏胞和僧侣代表举行联欢。解放盐井的解放军在与当地藏胞和僧侣代表举行联欢后，当地藏匿山中的“民兵”即有八十余人自动来归。
    广大藏族人民热烈地欢迎着自己的解放者。当解放军某部路经宁静县境时，各村藏民便纷纷携带麦饼、核桃、酥油等前来慰问。澜沧江两岸各山村的藏胞按照藏族风俗家家户户点起烟火，男女老少，站在路旁，鼓掌欢迎解放军。察雅县南部阿错村四个头人代表三百户藏胞和六个喇嘛寺的三百多个喇嘛，骑马赶了三天路程，前来向解放军献礼致敬，并要求给些三大纪律和八项注意的汉藏文标语由他们带回去广泛宣传。青康边境澜沧江上流雅曲河沿岸的藏胞，男人们用皮筏帮助解放军渡河，妇女们背着茶桶给解放军碗里装茶。战士们也热情地以糖和纸烟回敬藏胞。康北甘孜、德格、炉霍、道孚、邓柯、瞻化、石渠等地的藏胞，赶着成百成千的牦牛，帮助运送解放军的物资渡过金沙江。甘孜寺的喇嘛们并跳着狮子舞、野牛舞向解放军致敬，并为毛主席、朱总司令的健康而祈祷。
