　　"Current Affairs Handbook" Issue No. 2 to be Published
    Focusing on Resisting America and Aiding Korea, the "Propaganda Outline on How to Understand America" Fully Points Out the Hatefulness, Despicableness, and Political and Military Weaknesses of U.S. Imperialism.
    The small current affairs publication "Current Affairs Handbook," published by Xinhua Bookstore, will soon release its second issue. This issue includes articles such as Wu Lengxi's "Why the Chinese People Cannot Stand Indifferent to the U.S. Expanding its War of Aggression Against Korea," the propaganda outline "How to Understand America," Wen Jize's "Questions and Answers About the Atomic Bomb," and reference materials "The Friendly Relations Between China and the Soviet Union," "The October Revolution and the Soviet Union," and "What Stalin, Mao Zedong, Molotov, etc., Said About the Atomic Bomb Issue," etc. In addition, there are bi-weekly major events and four popular news items specially for local blackboard newspapers.
    The propaganda outline "How to Understand America" is divided into three parts. The first part is titled "Hate America, Because It Is the Deadly Enemy of the Chinese People." This section explains that the United States has historically consistently invaded our country, and is currently occupying our territory of Taiwan and is preparing to further invade China. It is the deadly enemy of the Chinese people, so all Chinese people should hate it. The second part is titled "Despise America, Because It Is a Decayed Imperialist Country, the Headquarters of Reaction and Degeneracy in the World." This section exposes the essence of U.S. monopoly capital rule, explaining the undemocratic nature of the U.S. economy and politics, as well as the cultural depravity, and explains the various practical manifestations of the U.S. war policy and aggressive policy. The third part is titled "Scorn America, Because It Is a Paper Tiger and Can Be Completely Defeated." This section explains the political and military weaknesses of the United States, and explains the reason why the United States is bound to fail. Each section is accompanied by the necessary basic information. This article is suitable as a reference for learning about current affairs and propaganda in various regions.
    Wen Jize's "Questions and Answers About the Atomic Bomb" provides a popular and concise explanation of the performance, effectiveness, weaknesses, and preventive measures of the atomic bomb, exposing the lies fabricated by U.S. imperialism and Kuomintang secret agents about the so-called "omnipotence of the atomic bomb."
    "Blackboard Newspaper" is a newly opened column in this issue. The articles in this column are specially for local blackboard newspapers and rooftop broadcasts in rural areas, to help solve the need for some current affairs propaganda materials.

　　《时事手册》第二期即出版
    以抗美援朝为中心内容，在“怎样认识美国”的宣传提纲中，充分指出了美帝的可恨、可鄙及其政治军事上的弱点。
    新华书店发行的小型时事刊物《时事手册》第二期即将出版。这一期登载的文章有吴冷西的《为什么我国人民对于美国扩大侵朝战争不能置之不理》，宣传提纲《怎样认识美国》，温济泽的《关于原子弹问答》，及资料《中国和苏联的友好关系》，《十月革命和苏联》，《斯大林、毛泽东、莫洛托夫等对原子弹问题是怎么说的》等。此外，尚有半月大事及专供各地黑板报采用的通俗消息四则。
    宣传提纲《怎样认识美国》共分三部分，第一部分标题是“仇视美国，因为它是中国人民的死敌”，这部分说明美国在历史上是一贯侵略我国的，目前则已侵占了我国领土台湾，并且正在准备进一步侵略中国，它是中国人民的死敌，所以全中国人民都应该仇视它。第二部分的标题是“鄙视美国，因为它是腐朽的帝国主义国家，是全世界反动堕落的大本营”，这部分揭露了美国独占资本统治的本质，说明了美国经济上和政治上的不民主及文化的堕落情形，说明了美国战争政策和侵略政策的各种实际表现。第三部分的标题是“蔑视美国，因为它是纸老虎，是完全可以打败的”，这部分说明了美国政治上的弱点及军事上的弱点，说明了美国必然失败的道理。各部分都附有必要的基本资料。该文适于作为各地学习时事和宣传时事的参考资料。
    温济泽的《关于原子弹问答》，对于原子弹的性能、效力、弱点及防备的办法作了通俗简要的解释，揭穿了美帝国主义和国民党特务分子所捏造的所谓“原子弹万能”的鬼话。
    “黑板报”是这一期新辟的一栏，这一栏的文章是专供各地黑板报及农村中的屋顶广播采用的，以帮助解决它们所需要的一部分时事宣传资料。
