Xinhua News Agency, New York, 14th: TASS reports: On November 8th, the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States issued a statement regarding the US government's attempt to provoke the People's Republic of China into war.

The statement said: "Today, as the Security Council is meeting, the world faces a new and serious crisis. Newspapers admit and the American people know that the US government has brought our country to the brink of total war against the People's Republic of China, and the danger of a Third World War is more acute than at any time since 1945. The current focus of this new crisis is MacArthur's demand that the United Nations approve direct military attacks on the People's Republic of China and the bombing of Chinese cities and civilians in Manchuria. He complains—in his words—that 'the current mission is limited to destroying those troops currently arrayed against us in Korea.' He proposes to take on the 'mission' of expanding the war, a war that has already cost the United States 30,000 lives and cost the lives of tens of thousands more Korean men, women, and children. Truman has not rejected these proposals. His recent speech reiterated the bipartisan—but not peaceful—policy of which MacArthur's proposals are the logical expression.

The time has come to understand the facts correctly.

It is a fact that US troops have approached the Manchurian border and the Soviet border. It is a fact that these borders were violated by our air force as early as August this year, and that Chinese territory and Soviet territory have been bombed more than once, and our government has admitted it. It is a fact that neither the Soviet Union believes, nor does China believe, that these bombings were accidental. However, their peaceful foreign policy prevents this military provocation from developing into a Third World War. It is a fact that the dispatch of the Seventh Fleet to Taiwan is a unilateral act of aggression by the US government. American interference in Taiwan further proves that China has been the main target of the United States in the Korean and Far Eastern operations from the beginning. MacArthur's army's crossing of the 38th parallel was completely unjustified and violated the solemn guarantees not to take such action, against the wishes of India, China, and the Soviet Union, whose populations account for more than half of humanity. Later, there were similar solemn guarantees that US troops in Korea would remain about fifty miles from the Manchurian border and the Soviet border. But they are now approaching the Yalu River, threatening the huge power station that supplies electricity to Manchurian industry and North Korean industry.

It is no secret that the majority in the United Nations would have been willing for the People's Republic of China to obtain its rightful place in the United Nations, if the US government had not been the main pillar (if not the only pillar) of that discredited, corrupt, and reactionary Chiang Kai-shek regime.

Recent events have shown that the US government is stubbornly trying to exclude the People's Republic of China from the United Nations, which is consistent with its policy of preparing a war of aggression against the liberated people of China for the purpose of Wall Street's world domination.

The American people have a long tradition of friendship with the Chinese people—and a legitimate contempt for the Chiang Kai-shek gang that has been driven out. Now is the time to consolidate this friendship—the strength of this friendship is extremely important for world peace. Now is the time for all peace-loving people, regardless of political differences, to unite their forces to jointly stop the unscrupulous militarists and warmongers.

We Communists have believed from the beginning that the Korean War began with the attack by the Rhee Syngman army, aided and abetted by the US government, which follows the interests of Wall Street imperialists. Recently, our opinion has been confirmed. On November 3, the National Assembly of South Korea rejected the prime minister appointed by Rhee Syngman by a vote of one hundred to twenty-one, and a large number of members of the assembly blamed the disastrous war on the Rhee Syngman cabinet. Many Americans hold other views regarding the causes of the Korean War, but differences of opinion on the question of how the war began should not prevent us from taking joint action to stop this war from spreading into a world war of large-scale human slaughter fought with atomic bombs."

The statement concludes by calling on people to unite on the "minimum program for peace," "to let the President and Congress know their will through letters, trade union resolutions, and mass rallies. Stop the unscrupulous campaign to prepare for the Third World War! Allow the People's Republic of China to enter the United Nations! Demand that a fully constituted Security Council seek peaceful means to end the Korean War!"

The statement also called for the withdrawal of all foreign armed forces from Korea and for respect for the borders of Manchuria and the borders of the Soviet Union.

　　美共全国委员会发表声明
　　反对美政府侵略中国
    号召人民团结一致制止战争挑拨者的罪行要求成份完全的安理会和平解决朝鲜问题
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：十一月八日，美国共产党全国委员会就美国政府企图挑衅使中华人民共和国进入战争一事，发表声明。
    声明称：“今天，当安全理事会正在举行会议的时候，世界面对着新的严重危机。报纸承认而且美国人民也知道：美国政府已使我国濒于对中华人民共和国进行全面战争的边缘，并且第三次世界大战的危险比一九四五年以来任何时候都更危急了。这个新危机的当前的焦点便是麦克阿瑟的要求，他要求联合国批准对中华人民共和国进行直接的军事进攻并批准对满洲的中国城市与平民进行轰炸。他抱怨——用他的话来说——‘目前的使命限于摧毁那些目前正在朝鲜与我们对垒的军队’。他建议负起扩大战争的‘使命’，这个战争已使美国有三万人丧失生命，并使成千成万更多的朝鲜男子妇女与儿童丧失生命。杜鲁门并未拒绝这些建议。他最近的一次演说曾重申两党的——但不是和平的——政策，麦克阿瑟的建议便是这政策的逻辑的表现。
    现在已经到了正确了解事实的时候了。
    美国部队已经接近了满洲边境与苏联边境，这是事实。这些边境早在今年八月便遭到我国空军的侵犯，并且中国领土与苏联领土也曾不止一次地遭到轰炸，这是事实，而且我国政府也已予以承认。苏联既不相信，而且中国也不相信这些轰炸是出于偶然的，这是事实。可是它们的和平外交政策却使它们不容这种军事挑衅发展成为第三次世界大战。派遣第七舰队赴台湾是美国政府单方面的侵略行为，这是事实。美国对台湾的干涉进一步地证明了中国自始即是美国在朝鲜及远东作战的主要目标。麦克阿瑟军队之越过三八线是完全没有理由的，而且是违反了不打算作这种行动的庄严保证的，是违背印度、中国与苏联的愿望的，而这三个国家的人口就占了人类的一大半。后来，又曾有同样庄严的保证，说美国在朝鲜的部队会停在距离满洲边境与苏联边境约五十英里的地方。可是他们现在已临近鸭绿江岸，威胁着那以电力供应满洲工业以及北朝鲜工业的巨大发电站。
    要不是美国政府一直是那声名扫地的、腐败而反动的蒋介石政权的主要支柱（如果说不是唯一支柱的话），联合国内的大多数会愿意中华人民共和国取得其在联合国内的正当地位，这已经不是秘密了。
    最近几天来的事件已经表明：美国政府顽固地力图将中华人民共和国排斥于联合国之外，这是与它为了华尔街称霸世界的目的而准备对解放了的中国的人民进行侵略战争的政策相一致的。
    美国人民对于中国人民有长久的友谊传统——而对已被赶掉了的蒋介石伙帮有正当的鄙视。现在是巩固这种友谊——这种友谊的力量对于世界和平是极为重要的——的时候了。现在是各界爱好和平的人民不分政治上的分歧，联合他们的力量以共同制止肆无忌惮的军国主义者和战争挑拨者的时候了。
    我们共产党人一开始就认为：朝鲜战争是以李承晚军队在唯华尔街帝国主义者的利益是从的美国政府帮助和教唆下进行的攻击行动开始的。最近，我们的意见被证实了。在十一月三日，南朝鲜的国民议会以一百票对二十一票拒绝批准李承晚所任命的总理，议会中有大量的议员将这次灾难性的战争归罪于李承晚内阁。关于朝鲜战争的起因，许多美国人持有其他的看法，但是在战争究竟如何开始这个问题上的意见的分歧不应该阻碍我们采取联合行动，以制止这次战争蔓延成大规模屠杀人类的以原子弹来打的世界大战。”
    声明结语呼吁人们在“争取和平的最低纲领”上团结起来，“通过信件、工会决议，和群众集会的方式使总统和国会知道他们的意志。停止肆无忌惮地准备第三次世界大战的运动！允许中华人民共和国进入联合国！要求成份完全的安全理事会寻求和平方法结束朝鲜战争！”
    声明也要求所有的外国武装部队撤出朝鲜并要求尊重满洲的边境与苏联的边境。
