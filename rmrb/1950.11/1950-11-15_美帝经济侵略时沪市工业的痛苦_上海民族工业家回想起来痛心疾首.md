　　The U.S. imperialists' economic aggression was a deliberate attempt to turn our country into their colony! After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, U.S. imperialism replaced Japanese imperialism, colluding with the Kuomintang bandit gang to implement its aggressive means. A massive influx of industrial products, wheat, cotton, and even cottonwood for making matches, severely impacted our industry and agriculture. Industry in general suffered widespread devastation: sales stagnated, inventories piled up, production came to a standstill, and unable to sustain themselves, factories closed down one after another. At the time, a very prominent figure in the business community said, "If you want to know how many factories have closed, just check the customs' import trade records!" At that time, large and small gatherings of the business community were invariably filled with worry and naturally touched upon the issue of their own survival. Except for the enamelware and rubber industries, which were less affected because of fewer imports of enamelware and rubber products, other industries such as pharmaceuticals, knitting, papermaking, machinery and electrical, leather making, medical equipment, dairy, chemical raw materials, household chemicals, and instruments and stationery suffered serious devastation.

　　In 1946, from January to September alone, U.S. drug imports were worth 25 billion in pseudo-currency, of which 20 to 30 types of drugs were dumped at low prices. In addition, there were 30,000 tons of "surplus drugs" stored on Okinawa, which were to be shipped to Shanghai, prompting the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Association to issue an urgent appeal. Of the original 200-plus pharmaceutical factories in Shanghai, most had come to a standstill. Several large factories also felt their financial turnover was sluggish. By the end of 1946, more than 120 factories had closed down or gone out of business. The Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory had to stop producing its self-made "Xiaozhilong" due to the dumping of U.S. goods.

　　In the wool textile industry, total sales of woolen fabric in 1946 were no more than 500,000 yards, while imports of U.S. and British woolen fabric reached 1.1 million yards in the ten months after that year. As a result, the sales of each factory were only six-tenths of their output; four-tenths of the woolen fabric was left in warehouses. Domestic women's woolen fabric suffered a setback, with no one interested. Inventory piled up, turnover was difficult, and the Dalun factory stopped work and laid off workers as a result. Several small factories also began to falter.

　　The dumping of nylon stockings brought the national knitting industry to the end of its rope. The cost of domestically produced hosiery exceeded the selling price of nylon stockings. Therefore, in December 1946, more than a dozen first-class factories, including China, Taiji, Qinyi, Hua'an, Huafeng, Meiqi, and Zhongxing, closed down one after another because they could not survive. Those that barely managed to keep operating could only work for two or three hours a day, or two days on and three days off. Recently, the knitting industry has also issued an appeal to ban the sale of smuggled U.S. nylon stockings.

　　The inability to sell paper became the fatal blow to the papermaking industry at that time. The reason for sluggish sales was the large-scale import of U.S. paper. In the second half of 1946, the Minfeng Paper Mill produced paper worth 30 million yuan in pseudo-currency every day, but it could not be sold and had to be sent to the warehouse. The cost of each ream of domestic newsprint was 50% higher than the selling price of Canadian newsprint. Therefore, the newsprint production of Tianzhang Paper Mill and Jiangnan Paper Mill had to be forced to stop, and they had to transform to produce other types of paper to barely survive.

　　Under the situation of a flood of U.S. finished leather, the leather making industry almost came to a standstill. In 1946, the income from sales of general factories was not enough to cover wage expenses. Therefore, the factories reduced production one after another. In October of that year, the monthly output of large and medium-sized factories decreased from 100,000 pounds to 20,000 pounds. Dahua Factory decreased from 60,000 pounds to 10,000 pounds, Zhongnan Factory decreased from 60,000 pounds to 6,000 pounds, and China Factory decreased from 60,000 pounds to 14,000 pounds.

　　Due to the large number of U.S. "surplus goods" engines being sold at reduced prices on the market, with prices only half of those before the war, almost all machinery factories were unable to continue manufacturing and transformed to produce other machine parts. For example, the Xinzhong Engineering Company in this city produced only a dozen engines in the four years from the victory to liberation, while this number was only the company's monthly output before the war. At the same time, small tools and machine tools came in continuously, and the machinery industry in Shanghai was further severely hit.

　　The copper material industry was also affected by the large-scale import and low-price dumping of U.S. copper sheets, with selling prices only reaching the cost of Shanghai copper material factories. Therefore, the industry suffered a setback in 1946 and almost collapsed.

　　Due to the large amount of U.S. "surplus military supplies" being purchased by bureaucratic capital and sold on the market, the electrical equipment industry was unable to manufacture motors and generators because the cost exceeded the selling price. This situation of devastating our country's industry was eliminated only after the liberation of this city.

　　The rapid development of the medical equipment industry in Shanghai after liberation also shows an example of how U.S. goods devastated our country's industry. Before liberation, due to the market being filled with U.S. goods, especially surplus goods with selling prices close to those of domestic goods, the sales of domestic products suffered a setback. At that time, there were only 17 or 18 factories remaining, and they all felt that they were struggling to survive in severe difficulties. However, in less than two years since liberation, the number of factories in the industry has surged to 213, and each can guarantee self-sufficiency. This fully demonstrates that the low-price dumping of U.S. goods has indeed affected the proper development of our country's industry.

　　According to customs statistics, from 1946 to 1948, U.S. milk imports amounted to 5,259,657 kilograms, butter 37,513 kilograms, milk powder 4,006,483 kilograms, and condensed milk 520,197 kilograms. U.S. milk, butter, KLIM milk powder, and condensed milk were everywhere in the market. The total output of all dairy farms in Shanghai was only 36,000 pounds per day. When U.S. milk powder filled the Chinese market at low prices, almost all dairy farms in Shanghai stopped. Many ranches slaughtered their cows and sold the meat to maintain the weak survival of a small portion of the cows. For example, the "Shengsheng Ranch" under the control of the pseudo-Central Trust Bureau, when the responsible comrades went to take over after the liberation of Shanghai, the cows were already emaciated from hunger. Farms with weak capital, such as Fumin Ranch, were forced to close down after slaughtering all but one cow. Condensed milk factories such as Gainaisheng were also closed at this time.

　　In terms of chemical raw materials, all 20 bleaching powder factories were shut down because a large amount of bleaching powder and bleaching powder essence were dumped at prices only one-fifth of the price of domestic bleaching powder. All ten caustic soda factories also stopped work due to the dumping of U.S. caustic soda and have not resumed work to this day. All five factories specializing in rosin production had to stop work and lay off workers due to the dumping of U.S. N rosin. In addition, five acetic acid factories and twelve gum factories also closed down for the same reason. When U.S. goods replaced Japanese goods in the household chemicals industry, the output and sales of the 119 large and small factories in this city quickly shrank by more than 50%. Manufacturers with relatively weak funds were completely at a standstill.

　　The commodity aggression of U.S. imperialism was far more extensive than that of Japanese goods. It not only filled the glass windows of major companies and department stores, but also piled up like mountains on the streets.

　　Today, Lin Rukang, manager of China Chemical Society, still said with emotion: "The cosmetics industry cannot forget the painful experience of U.S. commodity aggression. China Chemical Society struggled through very difficult conditions. When U.S. goods came, we had no way to survive! Today, we can no longer allow U.S. imperialism to invade us!" Ren Zhiwei of Weifu Factory said: "U.S. imperialism once used the privileges of customs and smuggling to import a large number of luxury goods. Not only did our cosmetics industry have no way to survive, but other industries could not thrive either."

　　Regarding the dumping of ink, someone once said: "If you pour the imported Parker ink into the swimming pool of the Jiangwan Stadium, you would need at least twelve pools of the same capacity to hold it." At the same time, the cost of domestic ink was more than twice that of Parker ink. Therefore, general ink factories could not survive. The fountain pen industry had the same situation.

　　In addition, the electrolytic industry, cement industry, flour industry, cigarette industry, glass industry, dye industry, celluloid industry, paint industry, printing ink industry, match industry, and toothbrush industry were also severely affected.

　　The above are just some fragmented facts, but these painful experiences should be fresh in the memory of our industrial circles. Especially today, when industry has achieved development under the independent and autonomous New Democratic economic policy, we should be even more vigilant about these painful experiences, enhance our hatred and contempt for U.S. imperialism, and recognize that U.S. imperialism is the enemy of all our people.

　　美帝经济侵略时沪市工业的痛苦
    上海民族工业家回想起来痛心疾首
    美帝对我们的经济侵略，是处心积虑地要把我们的国家沦为它的殖民地！抗战胜利，美帝代替了日帝，勾结着国民党匪帮，大施其侵略手段，大量的工业品、麦子、棉花甚至微至做火柴的棉杨木均滚滚而来，使我们工业和农业均遭到了严重的打击。一般工业几乎普遍的遭到了摧残：销路呆滞，存货堆积，生产陷入停顿状态，无法支持，纷纷关厂歇业。在当时，某工商界很有地位的人就说过：“如果要知道工厂有多少关门，只要去查查海关的进口贸易册就行了！”当时，工商界的大小集会，都愁眉不展的自然而然的触谈到本身生存问题。当时除了搪瓷业、橡胶业因为搪瓷品及橡胶制品输入较少，没有受到多大影响外，其他如制药、针织、造纸、机电、制革、医疗器械、牛乳、化学原料、家用化学、仪器文具等业都遭受到严重的摧残。
    在一九四六年，单是一至九月，美药进口就值伪法币二百五十亿元，其中有二三十种药都是用低价倾销。此外，还有“剩余药品”三万吨存冲绳岛，还要运沪，因此沪市制药业公会曾发出紧急呼吁。上海制药业原有二百余厂，当时就大都陷入停顿状态，若干大厂也感到周转欠灵，截至一九四六年年底，倒闭歇业的达一百二十余厂，信谊药厂自制的消治龙，因美货的倾销，而不得不停止制造。
    毛纺业一九四六年呢绒的总销量不过五十万码，而该年后十个月中美帝英帝的呢绒进口就达一百数十万码，因此，各厂的销量只及产量的十分之六；十分之四的呢绒全部搁在仓库里。国货女式呢更一蹶不振，无人问津。存货堆积，周转困难，大纶厂就因此而停工解雇工人，若干小厂亦发生动摇。
    由于玻璃丝袜的倾销，使得民族针织业陷入山穷水尽的境地，国货横机丝袜的成本高过了玻璃丝袜的售价，因此，在一九四六年十二月，就有中国、泰记、勤益、华安、华丰、美琪、中兴等十余家甲等厂由无法维持而相继倒闭，勉强维持开工的也只能每日开工二、三小时，或开二日停三日，最近，针织业还发出请求禁销美帝走私尼龙丝袜的呼吁。
    纸张不能畅销，也成为了当时造纸业的致命伤，销路呆滞的原因，就是由于美帝纸张的大量进口。民丰纸厂在一九四六年下半年每天生产价值三千万元伪法币的纸，卖不出去，只好送进仓库。国货白报纸每令成本高出加拿大报纸售价的百分之五十，因此天章纸厂江南纸厂的报纸生产，不得不被迫停止，而改造他种纸张，维持苟延残喘的局面。
    制革业在美货熟皮涌到的局面下，十九都陷入停顿状态，在一九四六年一般厂卖得货款抵工资开支都不够，因此各厂均纷纷减产，在该年十月份，大中厂的月产量就由十万磅减至二万磅，大华厂由六万磅减至一万磅，中南厂由六万磅减至六千磅，中国厂由六万磅减至一万四千磅。
    由于大批美国“剩余物资”的引擎在市场上削价倾销，价格仅合战前一半还不到，机器业几乎全部厂家都无法再继续制造，而纷纷改造其他机件。例如本市新中工程公司，自胜利至解放以前的四年中，引擎出品仅十余部，而这个数目在战前只不过是该公司一月的产量。同时小件工具和工作母机源源而来，沪市机器业则进一步的受到严重打击。
    铜料工业亦因美货铜皮大量进口，廉价倾销，售价仅达沪市铜料厂家的成本。所以该业于一九四六年间曾一度受此影响而一蹶不振，大有全业倒闭的趋势。
    电工器材业因为美帝的“剩余军用物资”，经过官僚资本的收购大量地在市场抛售，致使马达及发电机都因成本不及售价而无法制造，这个摧残我国工业的情形，到本市解放后才消灭。
    从解放后沪市医疗器械业迅速发展的事实上，也可以看出美货摧残我国工业的例证。解放前，由于美货充斥市场，尤以剩余物资售价与国货相近，国产品的销路一蹶不振。当时仅存厂家十七、八家，而且在严重的困难中都感觉到度日如年。但解放不到二年的今天，该业工厂已激增达二百十三家之多，而且家家都能保本自给。这充分说明了美货廉价倾销的确影响了我国工业的正当发展。
    据海关统计，自一九四六年到一九四八年三年里，美国来的牛奶进口五、二五九、六五七公斤，奶油三七、五一三公斤，奶粉四、○○六、四八三公斤，炼乳五二○、一九七公斤，市上到处出现着美国牛奶、奶油、KLIM奶粉、炼乳；而上海全部牛奶场的出产不过每日三万六千磅，当美货奶粉廉价充斥在中国市场时，上海的牛奶场差不多全部停顿了，很多牧场将奶牛杀掉卖肉，来维持另外一小部分奶牛弱小的生存。如伪中央信托局主持下的“生生牧场”，在上海解放后，负责同志去接管时，奶牛都已饿得瘦骨嶙峋。福民牧场等资本薄弱的牧场，竟至杀得只剩一条牛，被迫倒闭。炼乳厂如钙奶生等就都在这时关闭了。
    化工原料方面，漂粉厂原有二十家，由于大量漂粉及漂粉精以只及国产漂粉价格五分之一的低价倾销，二十家厂就此全部停工了。烧碱厂原有十家，也是在美货烧碱倾销下而全部停了工，而且一直到今天都没有复工。专制松香的厂五家，由于美货Ｎ松香的倾销，而不得不停工遣散。此外醋酸厂五家，树胶厂十二家，也都在同一原因下倒闭了。家用化学品工业在美货代替了日货涌来时，本市一一九家大小工厂中，产销量迅速萎缩了百分之五十以上。资金较为薄弱的厂家，完全陷入了停顿状态。
    美帝商品侵略是远较日货为广泛的，它不但充塞了各大公司、大商场的玻璃橱窗，连马路上，也堆积如山。
    在今天，中国化学社经理林汝康还感慨的说：“化妆品业是不能忘记美货侵略的痛苦经验的，中国化学社就是在很艰苦的状况下挣扎过来的。美货来了，我们就没有生路！今天再也不能容许美帝来侵略我们！”威福厂的任志威说：“美帝国主义曾利用海关与走私的特权，大量输入奢侈用品，不但我们化妆品工业没有生路，就是其他工业也是不能抬头的。”
    墨水的倾销，当时有人说过：“如果将进口的派克墨水，倾注在江湾体育场的游泳池内，至少须要十二个容量相同的池子，才可容纳。”同时，国产墨水的成本，高过了派克一倍以上，因此，一般墨水厂都无法维持。自来水笔业也有同样的情形。
    此外，电化工业、水泥工业、面粉工业、卷烟工业、玻璃工业、染料工业、赛珞璐工业、造漆工业、油墨工业、火柴工业、牙刷工业等也都受到相当严重的影响。
    以上只是一些零碎的事实，但这些痛苦的经历，在我们工业界里应当记忆犹新，尤其今天工业在独立自主的新民主主义经济政策下获得了发展，更应该把这些痛苦的经历，时加警惕，提高对于美帝的仇视、卑视，认清美帝是我们全体人民的敌人。
