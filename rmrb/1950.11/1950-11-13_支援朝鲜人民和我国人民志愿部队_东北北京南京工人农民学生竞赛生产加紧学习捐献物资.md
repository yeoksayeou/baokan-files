　　Supporting the Korean People and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    Workers, Peasants, and Students in Northeast China, Beijing, and Nanjing Compete in Production, Intensify Study, and Donate Supplies
    [This News Report] The heroic actions of our Volunteer Army in going to Korea to participate in the Korean people's war have received enthusiastic support from the broad masses of people in various parts of our country. Many regions are actively supporting the Korean people and our Volunteer Army with practical actions such as stepping up production and donating supplies.
    The vast number of farmers in Northeast China, which is close to Korea, in addition to the thousands of farmers who have volunteered to go to Korea to participate in the war, those who remain at home are fully supporting the Korean people and our Volunteer Army in fighting against U.S. imperialism. The farmers have put forward the slogan "Hand in public grain well, step up production, resist America and aid Korea." Some areas have also launched a wave of comforting the Korean People's Army and our Volunteer Army. The people of Lüda are automatically rushing to make comfort bags. The Shahekou District of Dalian City alone has made 663 bags, containing towels, toothbrushes, toothpaste, snacks, manuals, etc. In the Yanbian area of ​​Jilin Province, the upsurge of comforting the Korean People's Army and our Volunteer Army is even higher. Comfort funds alone have reached 750 million yuan (Northeast currency), and there are also 66 boxes of comfort items. Zhang Shuzhen, the women's director of Sihe Village in Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, volunteered to make cotton clothes and cotton shoes to donate to the Korean People's Army and our Volunteer Army. Liu Xifeng, a cadre of Xinzheng Village in Huadian County, Jilin Province, originally requested to go to Korea to join the Volunteer Army. The district and village leaders did not allow him to do so because his work was indispensable. He donated one million yuan (Northeast currency), which he had saved from frugality, to the Korean People's Army.
    The people of all walks of life in the capital have demonstrated an irresistible force in the movement to resist U.S. aggression, aid Korea, protect the home, and defend the country. In addition to a large number of people volunteering to go to Korea to participate in the war, many people have also donated supplies to support the Korean people and our Volunteer Army. As of the afternoon of the 8th, Class 1 of Department 2 of the North China People's Revolutionary University had donated 9,948,300 yuan, a gold ring weighing five qian, and ten shares of discounted public bonds. Cai Ronghui, a female student in Group 4 of the class, also donated her wedding ornament, a pure gold necklace. She said: "Although this thing is a souvenir, it is of no use to me. I donate it to turn it into strength and defeat the American aggressors as soon as possible." Cai Ronghui's lover, Zhang Dexin (Class 4), also donated his wedding ornament, a platinum ring. The Student Committee of Class 2 of the Department donated 1.89 million yuan to the Korean people. At the anti-American aggression and aid Korea forum held by Branch 4 of Department 1 of the school a few days ago, people hated the aggressive behavior of U.S. imperialism to the bone. 163 students signed up to join the Volunteer Army; at the same time, they donated 360,000 yuan, 215 jin of millet, and a new cotton quilt. The quilt was donated by classmate Zhao You. He said: "I used to be poor and knew the suffering of not having a quilt. Now the Korean brothers who have been ravaged by U.S. imperialism and have nowhere to go need quilts even more. I will give them to them!" Lao Xisong of the Department of Oriental Linguistics of the Faculty of Arts of Peking University donated 55,000 yuan. Comrade Chen Meiying, who works in the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, also donated a gold necklace.
    When the news of the annihilation of 6,000 enemies in the northwest region of Korea reached Nanjing, the worker brothers in the city's factories, railways, and enterprises shouted: "Well done! Well done!" The Instrument Manufacturing Factory Trade Union immediately issued a quick report. Old fitter Wu Youyin said: "Well done! We should step up production to support them even more!" Employees of public and private factories such as the Telecommunications Bureau, Jiangsu Postal Administration Bureau, Water Plant, Jiangnan Automobile Company, Machine Factory, and Dingchang Machine Factory have all put forward slogans for action in order to support the Korean People's Army and our Volunteer Army to win more and greater victories. Railway workers proposed: actively mobilize to ensure transportation safety. Deng Guiyong of the Wired Electric Factory said: Resolutely and victoriously complete the production tasks for November and December; Zhou Junqun and other five female workers in the winding room wrote their determination: "Resolutely support the Volunteer Army with production!" The Nanjing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions sent a letter to the Korean People's Army and our Volunteer Army, congratulating them on their victory, and stated: "We resolutely respond to the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, launch a patriotic production competition movement, and support you in winning greater victories." Teachers and students from schools such as Nanjing University, Water Conservancy College, Mining College, and Pharmaceutical College in Nanjing City, in addition to rejoicing, unanimously stated: They will support the heroic Korean People's Army and our Volunteer Army with concrete actions such as studying their regular courses well and launching current affairs propaganda. Farmers in the suburbs of the city believe that our Volunteer Army's operations in Korea are completely just and heroic. "In the past, the Korean people helped us fight against the Japanese devils. Now we should help the Korean people fight against the American devils." Shen Yuanlin, director of the Central Village Farmers Association in District 11, said: "We must hand in public grain well and help the Volunteer Army fight against the American devils!"
