The flames of the American imperialist war of aggression threaten Antung City, the beautiful city at the forefront of our national defense. "Resolutely resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country" is the common aspiration expressed by the 300,000 people of the city through various practical actions.

After American planes inhumanely strafed and bombed Sinuiju, black smoke covered the southern half of Antung City. The people of Antung City clearly saw groups of Korean women and children dressed in white being driven to the cold riverbank. The brutal crimes of American imperialism have made the people of Antung City unable to contain the anger in their hearts. Many young workers and students joined the volunteer army to resist America and aid Korea. Many female workers also volunteered to go to Korea for rescue work. Farmers in the suburbs spontaneously organized hundreds of stretcher teams and volunteered to go to Korea to participate in the Korean people's war of resistance against America. They solemnly swore to the motherland: In order to resist American aggression and defend the security of the motherland, we will fight side by side with our Korean brothers to the end. Song Chuan-yi, a 68-year-old farmer in the suburbs, recalled the past when Japan annexed Korea in the Jiawu Year and then used various excuses to invade Antung and the entire Northeast. He said angrily, "I see through it all. Today, the path taken by the American devils is no different from the one Japan took back then. We have to fight them!" His only son was killed by American bullets in the War of Liberation. This unyielding old man firmly stated that he would organize a volunteer stretcher team to go to Korea to participate in the war. Zhang Yun-zhi, a fisherman who was wounded by American planes on the Yalu River, is still recovering in the hospital. He said with gritted teeth, "When my injuries heal, I will cross the river to take revenge."

Under the constant threat of American planes, the workers of Antung City are continuing to produce more actively. Under the magnificent slogan of "Using production to defeat the enemy," all the workers of the State-owned Eighth Rubber Factory have not only increased production but also achieved a 100% quality standard. Sun Gui-ying, a 25-year-old female worker in the factory, and her husband both lost their jobs when the Chiang-American bandit gang ruled Antung. They ate wild vegetables all day long to satisfy their hunger. A child who was less than three years old starved to death. But in the people's motherland, she and her husband both had jobs again, and she also enjoyed labor insurance benefits. Her seven-year-old eldest son also went to school, and her baby born in March this year entered the factory's nursery. These benefits were unimaginable in the old society. When she works, she thinks of the American devils, she thinks of the Kuomintang, and she thinks of her own life and the beautiful prospects of the motherland, and her hands work like flying. She said: "The more shoes we produce, the more we increase the strength of the country!" The wood pot room of the Antung Paper Mill often stopped work due to American air raids, but it still guarantees the supply of sufficient raw materials for the paper making department, and the quality has also increased by 7%. Recently, the room also proposed to all factories and mines in the city to launch a patriotic production competition, ensuring that all difficulties will be overcome resolutely and tasks will be completed. The municipal Gonghe Dyeing Factory has doubled its production efficiency with a reduced workforce, and the quality has also improved significantly.

The young students of Antung City are filled with patriotic enthusiasm and have written letters of determination, unanimously stating that they are not afraid of any sacrifice in order to defend the security of the motherland. Elementary school teachers systematically publicize the American imperialists' aggressive conspiracies and crimes to the residents of the streets. Medical workers in public and private hospitals have also spontaneously organized rescue brigades to prevent the invasion of American mad dogs. In order to defend their homes and the country and to replenish the funds for national defense construction, industrialists and businessmen have enthusiastically fulfilled their tax obligations.

People from all walks of life in Antung City have come to understand the great and sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending their homes and country from their personal experiences. Because it is very clear that no one wants to eat cornmeal and bean cakes again, and no one wants to live a miserable life of being enslaved again.

　　站在国防最前线的安东市人民
    美帝国主义侵略战争的火焰，威胁着我们祖国国防最前线的美丽都市——安东市。“坚决抗美援朝、保家卫国”，这是全市三十万人民，以各种不同的实际行动，表达出来的相同的志愿。
    美国飞机无人性地扫射和轰炸新义州，黑烟遮住了安东市的南半天，安东市人民清楚地看到：对岸成群身着白色服装的朝鲜妇女、儿童被赶到冰冷的江边。美帝国主义的残暴罪行，已使安东市人民按捺不住胸中的怒火。许多青年工人和学生参加了抗美援朝的志愿部队。许多女工也志愿赴朝作救护工作。市郊农民，自动组织了数百付担架队，志愿赴朝参加朝鲜人民的抗美战争。他们向祖国庄严地宣誓：为了反抗美国的侵略，保卫祖国的安全，我们一定和朝鲜兄弟并肩战斗到底。六十八岁的市郊农民宋传义，回忆起甲午年日本吞并朝鲜后，紧接着找各种借口来侵占安东和整个东北的往事时，十分愤怒地说：“我算看透了。今天美国鬼子走的道，和日本当初所走的一点没差。不和他干是不行的了！”他唯一的儿子是在解放战争中被美国子弹打死的，这不屈的老人坚决地表示要组织志愿担架队，去朝鲜参战。在鸭绿江被美国飞机打伤的渔夫张云芝，现在还在医院里养伤。他切齿痛恨地说：“我的伤养好，就过江去报仇。”
    在美国飞机的不断威胁下，安东市的工人们正更加积极地继续进行生产。国营第八橡胶厂全体工人在“用生产战胜敌人”的雄壮口号下，不仅提高了产量，并使质量达到百分之百的标准。该厂二十五岁的青年女工孙桂英和她的丈夫在蒋美匪帮统治安东时都失了业，终日以野菜充饥，一个不满三岁的幼儿，是活活地饿死了。但在人民的祖国里，她和她的丈夫都重新有了职业，她还享受劳动保险待遇。她的七岁的大儿子也入了学，今年三月生的幼儿又入了工厂的托儿所。这些好处，在旧社会里是想都不敢想的。她在工作中，一想到美国鬼子，就想到国民党，又想到自己的生活和祖国的美丽的远景，两只手就像飞一样的工作。她说：“我们多生产一双鞋，就多增加一分国家的力量！”安东造纸厂木釜室经常因美国飞机侵袭而停工，但仍保证供给抄纸部足用的原料，并且质量还提高了百分之七。最近该室又向全市各厂矿提出展开爱国主义生产大竞赛，保证坚决克服一切困难，完成任务。市营公和染厂在人员减少的情况下，生产效率却较前提高一倍，质量也有很大的改善。
    安东市的青年学生们，洋溢着满腔爱国的热情，纷纷写下决心书，一致表示：为了保卫祖国的安全，不怕任何牺牲。小学教师们有计划地向街道居民宣传美帝国主义者的侵略阴谋和罪行。公私医院的医务工作者，也自动组织了救护大队，预防着美国疯狗的侵袭。工商业者为了保家卫国，充实国防建设的费用，都踊跃地完成了纳税义务。
    安东市各阶层人民，都从切身的体验中理解到抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大神圣任务。因为事情非常明显，谁也不愿意再吃棒子面、豆饼，再过被奴役的苦日子了。
