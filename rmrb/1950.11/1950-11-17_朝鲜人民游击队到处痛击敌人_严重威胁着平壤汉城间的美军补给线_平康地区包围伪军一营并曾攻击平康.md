Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch: The invading American forces are falling into the net of the Korean People's Guerrilla forces. Whether in the front or rear, the People's Guerrillas are attacking the enemy everywhere with "mysterious" (Associated Press) sieges, ambushes, and other methods.

In the vast area between Seoul and Pyongyang, powerful Korean People's Guerrilla forces are containing a large number of American troops and continuously inflicting heavy blows on them. According to Associated Press reporters Erickson and Lambert, the "military situation is more serious" in the rear of the US military. A large number of People's Guerrillas "re-assembled in the center of the peninsula north of the 38th parallel" and are "conducting operations under good command." This group of guerrilla forces continuously ambushes the American troops held in the triangle area between Icheon, Pyongyang, and Cheorwon. On November 11, in the battle west of Icheon, the guerrillas used 75mm guns and mortars to bombard the enemy. After being beaten for 45 minutes, the American troops "could not find the cannons and mortars." In the ambushes west of Sibyeon and near Yeoncheon, the American troops lost six military vehicles, and the rest were burned. On the same day, the People's Guerrillas surrounded a battalion of Syngman Rhee puppet troops in the Pyonggang area, about 60 miles northeast of Seoul. According to a Reuters report, the guerrillas attacked Pyonggang again in the early morning of the 14th. On the 13th, a train carrying Turkish mercenary troops was attacked by guerrillas about four miles northwest of Seoul. Lambert helplessly admitted that the Korean People's Guerrillas are "indeed a threat" to the American invading army's "main supply line from Seoul to Pyongyang."

The American troops have difficulty moving an inch in the occupied areas, and even in Pyongyang city, the People's Guerrillas are active. They attack the enemy in miraculous ways. Lambert cited "two examples of the Korean people continuing to fight for the communist cause." "One day, a small team of American patrol troops in a jeep cautiously advanced towards the desolate winter mountains north of the 38th parallel, carefully searching the small hills along the way, because it was said that several Red Army soldiers were hiding inside. Suddenly, a gunshot was heard, and the patrol was ambushed. Twelve American soldiers were captured, and only one escaped." Another example is in Pyongyang, "A few days ago, some military police were warming themselves around a fire at night when suddenly, someone in the next room opened fire on them." This is how the Korean people "perplexingly" demand blood debts from the American bandits, so that the American invaders had to keep the so-called "highly trained" 187th Airborne Regiment stationed in Pyongyang to deal with these "serious" and "troublesome" attacks.

TASS dispatch, 16th: The General Headquarters of the Korean Democratic People's Republic People's Army announced on the 15th that there were no major changes on the front line in the past 24 hours.

The People's Army units are conducting active combat in the Cheongcheon River and Deokcheon areas.

### 朝鲜人民游击队到处痛击敌人  严重威胁着平壤汉城间的美军补给线  平康地区包围伪军一营并曾攻击平康

　　朝鲜人民游击队到处痛击敌人
    严重威胁着平壤汉城间的美军补给线平康地区包围伪军一营并曾攻击平康
    【新华社十六日讯】侵朝美军正陷入朝鲜人民游击部队的罗网中。无论在前方或后方，人民游击队正在每一个角落用“神秘莫测”（美联社）的围攻、伏击和其他方式到处打击敌人。
    在汉城与平壤之间的广大地区内，强大的朝鲜人民游击队牵制着大量美国军队，并连续给以痛击。据美联社记者艾里克森、兰伯特报道：美军后方“军事情况更加严重”。大批人民游击队“在三八线以北半岛中心重新集合”，“在良好的指挥下进行作战”。这批游击部队连续伏击被牵制在伊州——平壤——铁原之间三角地带的美军。十一日，在伊川以西之役，游击队曾以七五口径大炮和迫击炮轰击敌人，美军在挨打了四十五分钟之后，“却找不到大炮和迫击炮”的踪影。在市边以西和涟川附近的伏击战中，美军损失军车六辆，其余被烧毁。同一天，人民游击队在汉城东北约六十英里的平康地区包围了李承晚伪军一个营。另据路透社消息：十四日清晨，游击队再度攻击平康。十三日，在靠近汉城西北四英里处，载运土耳其仆从军队的火车，就遭受游击队袭击。兰伯特无奈地承认：朝鲜人民游击队对于美国侵略军队“从汉城到平壤的主要补给线的确是个威胁”。
    美军在侵占区内寸步难行，甚至在平壤市内也活跃着人民游击队。他们以神奇的方式打击敌人。兰伯特举出了朝鲜人民“继续为共产主义事业作战的两个实例”“一小队乘着吉普车的美国巡逻部队有一天小心翼翼地向着三八线以北的冬天的荒山前进，沿路仔细搜察那些小山，因为据说有几个红军士兵躲藏在里面。忽然听到一声枪响，巡逻部队就中了伏击。十二个美国兵被俘，只有一个逃脱了。”另一个例子是在平壤，“几天以前，有几个宪兵在夜晚正围着火取暖，突然，隔壁屋子里有人向他们开枪射击。”朝鲜人民就是这样“令人疑惑不定”地向美国强盗们索还血债，以致美国侵略者不得不使所谓“受过高度训练”的第一八七团伞兵部队留驻平壤，去应付这些“具有严重性”的“伤脑筋”的袭击。
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部十五日发表战报称：在过去二十四小时内，前线无重大变化。
    人民军部队在清川江及德川地区进行积极的战斗。
