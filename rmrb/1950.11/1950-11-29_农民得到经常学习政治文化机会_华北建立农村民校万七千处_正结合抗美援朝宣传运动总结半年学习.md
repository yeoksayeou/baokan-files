　　Farmers Gain Frequent Opportunities to Study Politics and Culture
　　17,000 Rural Public Schools Established in North China
　　Summarizing Half-Year of Study in Conjunction with the Resist America, Aid Korea Propaganda Campaign
　　[Xinhua News Agency] Rural public school education in North China has developed unprecedentedly, giving the broad masses of peasants frequent opportunities to study politics and culture.

　　Due to the peasants' urgent need for political and cultural learning after the land reform, the seasonal winter schools could no longer meet their needs. When the winter school movement ended this spring, all localities paid attention to transforming the winter schools with suitable conditions and foundations into regular public schools. Since March, over 17,000 public schools have been established throughout the region. Pingyuan Province has the most public schools, with over 9,700, an increase of more than thirteen times compared to last year's 667; there are more than 350,000 male and female students. Next is Shanxi, with over 6,100 public schools in the province. In Changzhi Prefecture, which is doing better, an average of over 100 people per school regularly persist in learning. In most areas, public schools have become mass-based, organized learning institutions.

　　This year's achievements in public school education in North China are greater than in any previous year. The biggest gain is in literacy education. After half a year of study, entering peasants can generally recognize around 300 characters. Young men and women can recognize 500 to 600 characters. The results of tests in seven counties, including Licheng in Shanxi, show that nearly 10,000 illiterates have become semi-literate. Many peasants have learned to keep accounts, do calculations, and write letters. Secondly, there have been great achievements in the publicity and education of current affairs and policies. During the peace signature campaign, public schools became the best places for the masses to discuss current affairs. In the current Resist America, Aid Korea movement, public schools in various places are even more active. Thirteen public schools in the suburbs of Zhangjiakou City have held forums for several days, and female students have enthusiastically expressed their willingness to make military uniforms and shoes to support the volunteers going to Korea. The second gain of public school education is in the education of production technology and scientific knowledge. When sowing in Anyang and other counties in Pingyuan Province, public schools universally explained production technologies such as mercury preparations and warm water seed soaking. When Yangtian Village in Chicheng County, Chahar, was delivering manure, the public school explained what kind of fertilizer should be applied to what kind of crops. After Changzhi, Shanxi, suffered a hailstorm, the public school educated everyone: "To live, you have to move, sighing and complaining is useless." This encouraged the peasants to overcome the disaster and promoted replanting work. In addition, some public schools have also explained common knowledge of maternal and child health, which has been supported by the broad masses of peasants.

　　Public school education in various places has a variety of activities according to the local production season. During the busy farming season, the public schools in Wu'an County, Hebei Province, are changed to noon schools or evening schools. Some villages use the method of "little teachers delivering characters" in the fields during the busy farming season to study in the fields. In many places in Shanxi, men take books to the fields, and women take books to the kitchen. In the past, it was said that "there is no time to study during the busy farming season," but now it has become "study whenever there is time." Cen Village, Qiqu District, Anyang, Pingyuan, divided the large public school into small public schools, and the study groups were combined with mutual aid groups, so that they could study when they rested on the land, breaking the saying that "winter schools are afraid of the New Year; public schools are afraid of the busy farming season," and persisted in regular study.

　　Governments at all levels and the CCP committees attach great importance to public schools. The People's Governments of all prefectures and counties in Pingyuan Province have organized public school committees to provide unified leadership and regularly convene public school work conferences to exchange experiences. Hebei and Shanxi have mobilized primary school teachers, intellectuals in the countryside, and labor heroes to serve as public school teachers or to speak at public schools, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient public school teachers. Some villages have adopted the method of "being a student in the morning and a teacher in the afternoon" or "people teaching people" between husband and wife or brothers and sisters, making public schools a widespread mass learning organization. In addition, public schools in various places regularly hold tests, summaries, and commendations for models to consolidate and improve learning enthusiasm. At present, public schools in various places are combining the Resist America, Aid Korea propaganda movement to conduct a half-year study summary, preparing to enter a larger-scale winter school movement.

　　农民得到经常学习政治文化机会
    华北建立农村民校万七千处   
    正结合抗美援朝宣传运动总结半年学习
    【新华社讯】华北农村民校教育工作空前发展，广大农民从而得到经常学习政治、文化的机会。
    由于土地改革以后广大农民政治文化学习要求的迫切，季节性的冬学已不能满足他们的需要。今春冬学运动结束时，各地都注意把有条件有基础的冬学转为经常民校。自三月份迄今，全区建立民校一万七千余处。民校最多的平原省共有九千七百余处，比去年六百六十七处增加十三倍多；男女学员达三十五万多人。次为山西，全省共有民校六千一百多处，较好的长治专区，平均每校经常有一百人以上坚持学习。民校在多数地区已成为群众性的有组织的学习机关。
    今年华北民校教育成绩比以往任何一年都大。收获最大的是识字教育。入学农民经过半年学习，一般都能识字三百左右。青年男女则识到五、六百字。山西黎城等七县民校测验的结果，说明已有近万个文盲变成了粗通文字的人。不少农民学会了记账、算账和写信。其次在时事政策的宣传教育上也有很大的成绩。和平签名运动中，民校成为群众讨论时事最好的场所。当前抗美援朝运动中，各地民校更加活跃。张家口市郊区十三处民校连日举行座谈会，妇女学员踊跃表示愿做军衣、军鞋支援赴朝志愿军。民校教育的第二个收获是在生产技术、科学知识的教育方面。平原省安阳等县播种时民校普遍讲解水银制剂、温汤浸种等生产技术。察哈尔赤城县样田村送粪时，民校就讲什么样庄稼上什么粪。山西长治在遭受雹灾后，民校教育大家：“要活就得动，唉声叹气不顶用”。鼓舞农民战胜灾荒，推动了补种工作。此外，有些民校还讲解了妇婴卫生常识，受到广大农民的拥护。
    各地民校教育根据当地生产季节，活动方式是多种多样的。河北省武安县民校在农忙期间改为午学或晚学。有些村在农忙时采用小先生送字办法，在地里学习。山西不少地方男人带书本下地，妇女带书本下灶房。过去“农忙时间不能学”，现在变为“一有空，就学习”。平原安阳七区岑头村把大民校分成小民校，学习组结合互助组，上地休息时就学习，打破了“冬学怕过年；民校怕农忙”的说法，坚持了经常学习。
    各级人民政府与中共党委对民校都很重视。平原省各专区和县人民政府都组织了民校委员会，统一领导，并定期召开民校工作会议，交流经验。河北、山西发动了小学教员、在乡知识分子、劳动英雄等任民校先生，或到民校讲话，克服了民校教员不足的困难。有的村采取“上午当学生、下午当先生”，或夫妻、兄弟互教互学的“民教民”的办法，使民校成为广泛群众性的学习组织。此外，各地民校定期举行测验、总结、表扬模范，以巩固提高学习情绪。现各地民校正结合抗美援朝宣传运动，进行半年学习总结，准备进入更大规模的冬学运动。
