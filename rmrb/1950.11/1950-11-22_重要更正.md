Important Correction

　　In the "News Work" issue No. 23 (November 8th), in the newspaper review article "On Current Affairs Propaganda in Newspapers," the phrase in the sixth paragraph, "Xinhua News Agency's reports on the major victories of the Korean People's Army's counter-offensive and the local people's movement against American imperialist aggression did not receive greater attention," was missing the word "对于 (regarding)" before it. The complete sentence should be, "Regarding Xinhua News Agency's reports on the major victories of the Korean People's Army's counter-offensive and the local people's movement against American imperialist aggression, they did not receive greater attention." We hereby make this correction.

　　重要更正
    “新闻工作”第二十三期（十一月八日）报纸述评《论报纸上的时事宣传》一文第六段“新华社关于朝鲜人民军反攻中重大胜利的报道以及当地人民反对美帝侵略的运动，都没有给予更大的重视”一句前面漏掉“对于”二字，全句应为“对于新华社关于朝鲜人民军反攻中重大胜利的报道以及当地人民反对美帝侵略的运动，都没有给予更大的重视”。特此更正。
