　　Jiaoda Beijing Institute's Popular Cartoon Explanations; "Train Propaganda" Has Begun
    [Reported by this newspaper] On the 19th, all faculty, staff, and students of Jiaoda Beijing Institute went out to conduct propaganda. In addition to the Materials Department, Economics Department, and Russian Language Specialized School starting train propaganda on the Beijing-Tianjin and other three lines, all other propaganda teams went to the streets for broader and deeper propaganda. The faculty and staff have not stopped working; after conducting key interviews with residents, they immediately seized the time to actively prepare for street propaganda. The students have been out propagating for the fourth day, and will also go to the trains for propaganda on the 20th and 21st. At 1:30 PM, the Trade Union, Transportation Department, and Telecommunications Department's three propaganda brigades set off in three directions, attracting more than four thousand viewers in five hours. Based on the experience of several days of propaganda, a large number of cartoons were created according to the masses' thoughts and psychology. Cartoon explanations during the propaganda were warmly welcomed by the masses. As soon as one picture was finished, they asked to explain the second one quickly. Those who understood nodded knowingly, and those who didn't understand asked questions. When it was time to leave, the folks hadn't heard enough, and the children shouted loudly, "Goodbye." The performance of the living newspaper play also aroused the audience's boundless anger towards American imperialism. An old man in his seventies took the lead in shouting slogans and even gave them four simple lines of poetry.

　　交大京院漫画解说受欢迎“列车宣传”已开始进行
    【本报讯】交大京院教职工同学十九日全体出动进行宣传。除材料系、经济系、俄专在京津等三线上开始作列车宣传外，其他各宣传队，全体出动到街头作了更广泛更深入的宣传。教职工们一直没停止工作，在进行了对居民的重点访问后，马上争取时间积极地作了关于街头宣传的准备。同学们已经是第四天出动宣传，同时二十、二十一日还要到列车上去宣传。下午一时半，工会、运输系、电信系三个宣传大队分三路出发，五个小时内吸引了四千余观众。根据数天来宣传的经验，按照群众思想和心理，创作了大批漫画。在宣传中进行漫画解说，受到群众热烈的欢迎。一张刚讲完，纷纷要求快讲第二张。他们听得懂的就心领神会似地连连点头，听不懂的就问。要走的时候，老乡们还没听够，小朋友们大声的喊着“再见”。活报剧的演出，也激起了观众对美帝的无比愤怒。七十多岁的老头带头呼口号，还送给他们很朴实的四句诗。
