　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 17th, TASS dispatch: *Pravda* correspondent Chechkinina reported on the Italian laboring people's strike on November 14th in her Rome dispatch. She wrote: On that day, approximately five million industrial and transport workers throughout Italy went on strike. Workers in all factories and institutions in Turin and Milan went on strike, while in other cities, 95% to 100% of workers and the vast majority of office workers went on strike. In Genoa, the strike was comprehensive, with the port, factories, and transport all paralyzed for eight hours.

　　Chechkinina pointed out that the strike was caused by the following facts: the Industrialists' Confederation systematically sabotaged negotiations with trade unions regarding wage issues for certain types of workers. The economic situation of the Italian working class is deteriorating. The trap of the Marshall Plan is tightening around the necks of the laboring people. The war preparation policy implemented by the Gasperi government and their servile obedience to the adventurous plans of the American imperialists have brought Italy to the brink of collapse. Unemployment is increasing dramatically. Even according to official materials, which certainly do not reflect the actual situation, there were already more than two million unemployed in Italy on January 1, 1950. If those who only work part-time or temporary jobs are included, this number will reach seven million.

　　The poverty of those laboring people who still manage to maintain their jobs is keeping pace with the growth of unemployment. The prices of the most important necessities are constantly rising, while wages remain the same, or are even insufficient to make ends meet. According to estimates by Italian trade union organizations, the minimum cost of living for a family of four is approximately 52,000 lire per month. However, workers in the machine manufacturing and metallurgy industries only receive an average wage of 26,862 lire per month, textile workers 17,900 lire, and food industry workers 18,471 lire.

　　Chechkinina said: Visiting any working-class family in any Italian city, you will see with your own eyes that the Italian laboring people are starving and living in extreme poverty. Wherever you go, you can see the desperate poverty, constant deprivation, and unavoidable unemployment caused by the Italian government's arms expansion policy and surrender to American imperialism.

　　Chechkinina emphasized at the end of her dispatch: The strike on November 14th once again demonstrated the unity of the Italian working class and their indomitable will to fight for the rights and demands of the working class.

    契奇金纳报道意大利罢工原因
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十七日电：真理报记者契奇金纳在她的罗马通讯中报道意大利劳动人民十一月十四日的罢工。她写道：那一天，约五百万工业和运输业的职工们在全意大利举行罢工。都灵和米兰所有工厂和机关的职工都举行罢工，其他城市则有百分之九十五至百分之百的工人和绝大多数的机关职员罢工。在热那亚，罢工是具有全面性质的，港口、工厂和运输全部瘫痪达八小时之久。
    契奇金纳指出，罢工是因下列事实引起的：工业家联合会有计划地破坏与工会进行的关于某些种类的工人工资问题的谈判。意大利工人阶级的经济状况每况愈下。马歇尔计划的圈套在劳动人民的颈上扣得更紧了。加斯贝利政府所执行的备战政策和他们对美帝国主义者冒险计划奴颜婢膝的服从，已使意大利濒于崩溃。失业正在可怕地增加。甚至根据那当然不会反映实际状况的官方材料，意大利在一九五○年一月一日已有两百多万人失业。如果把那些只做部分时间的工作或临时工作的人们计算在内，这个数字将达到七百万人。
    那些仍能设法维持他们职业的劳动人民，其贫困是与失业的增长并驾齐驱的。最重要的必需品不断涨价，而工资则仍然如故，甚至不足糊口。据意大利工会组织的估计，四口之家的最低生活费用每月约为五万二千里拉。可是，机器制造业和冶金业的工人每月只获得平均工资二万六千八百六十二里拉，纺织业工人一万七千九百里拉，粮食业工人一万八千四百七十一里拉。
    契奇金纳说：访问任何意大利城市中任何工人阶级的家庭，你会亲眼看见意大利劳动人民正在挨饿，过着极端贫困的生活。无论你走到那里，你总可以看见由于意大利政府的扩军政策和对美帝国主义屈服而引起的绝望的贫穷、经常的匮乏和无法避免的失业。
    免契奇金纳在通讯结尾中着重指出：十一月十四日的罢工，又一次证明了意大利工人阶级的团结和为工人阶级的权利与要求而进行斗争的不屈不挠的意志。
