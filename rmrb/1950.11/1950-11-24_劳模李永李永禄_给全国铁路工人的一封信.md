　　A Letter to Railway Workers Across the Country
　　Calling for learning from the working methods and heroic spirit of Soviet railway workers in the war against German fascist aggression, and launching a patriotic production competition.
　　[Report from Our Newspaper] According to the Worker's Daily, national railway labor models Li Yong and Li Yonglu wrote a letter to railway workers across the country, calling on everyone to respond to the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the National Committee of the Railway Workers' Union, launch a patriotic production competition, complete the 1950 production tasks ahead of schedule, and fight to smash the American imperialist aggression. The original letter is as follows:

Comrades Railway Workers Across the Country:

　　Last year, we visited Moscow. When we visited the Soviet Museum of Technology, the comrade in charge there told us about the work of Soviet workers during the Soviet-German war and showed us films. We learned that when the war was at its most intense, railway bureaus, factories, and workshops throughout the Soviet Union launched the "Stakhanov" movement, and a national production competition was launched. Although the war was very fierce and the German invaders frequently carried out sabotage, the transportation was never interrupted because the Soviet workers braved gunfire and were not afraid of danger to repair the railways. Therefore, not only was the support for the front line not affected, but also the national economy was not damaged. In the "Stakhanov" movement, many outstanding workers and labor models also emerged. They created many new working methods in difficult environments. For example, when new rails were being laid after the tracks were bombed, because the rails were of different lengths, holes had to be drilled at the joints, which took a lot of time. So the workers came up with a way to drill holes with guns, which solved the problem. There are too many examples like this. The Soviet workers' spirit of overcoming difficulties, their strong will, and their spirit of loving their country are truly admirable.

　　Comrades Chinese Railway Workers, everyone should think carefully about how difficult it was for us to be oppressed and exploited by American imperialism, Japanese imperialism, and the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, and how precious the freedom and improvement of life after liberation are. Now, American imperialism is invading our neighboring country Korea, occupying our Taiwan, and violating our Northeast airspace, killing and wounding people, and damaging locomotives. Many facts of aggression are in front of us. Today, we are asking railway comrades across the country for a few very small things: First, respond to the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Railway Union, launch a large-scale competition, and complete the 1950 production tasks ahead of schedule; second, learn from the working methods and heroic spirit of Soviet workers; third, eliminate all accidents. Today, we are in charge and have become masters. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, we must unite well and complete the production tasks assigned to us by our superiors ahead of schedule, and fight to resist America, aid Korea, defend our homes and defend our country.

    给全国铁路工人的一封信
    号召学习苏联铁路工人在反对德国法西斯侵略战争中的工作方法和英勇精神，展开爱国主义生产竞赛。
    【本报讯】据工人日报消息：全国铁路劳模代表李永、李永禄写信给全国铁路工人，号召大家响应全国总工会与铁路工会全国委员会的号召，展开爱国主义生产竞赛，提前完成一九五○年生产任务，为粉碎美帝国主义侵略而奋斗。原信如下：全国铁路工人同志们：
    去年我们去过一趟莫斯科。当我们参观苏联技术博物馆的时候，那里的负责同志给我们讲苏德战争时苏联工人的工作情形，并演电影给我们看。我们知道了当战争最激烈的时候，苏联的各铁路局、各工厂、各车间都展开了“斯达哈诺夫”运动，全国展开了生产大竞赛。虽然战争很激烈，德寇经常进行破坏，但是由于苏联工人冒着枪林弹雨，不怕危险的抢修，运输一直没有中断过，因此不单支援前线的工作没有受到影响，国家经济也没有被损害。在“斯达哈诺夫”运动中还出现了很多优秀工作者和劳动模范。他们在艰苦的环境中创造了许多新工作方法，如铁轨被炸后重铺新轨时，因为长短不齐，在接缝处都要另打眼，需费很大的时间，于是工人想出办法，用枪打眼，解决了问题。这样的例子太多啦。苏联工人们克服困难的精神、坚强的意志和热爱祖国的精神，实在值得钦佩。
    我们中国铁路工人同志们，大家要好好的想一想，我们过去受美帝国主义、日本帝国主义及国民党反动派的压迫剥削，是多么难受，解放后的自由和生活的改善又是多么宝贵。现在美帝国主义又侵略我们邻国朝鲜，侵占我们的台湾，侵犯我们东北领空，杀伤人命，打坏机车，许多侵略事实都摆在我们的面前了。今天我们向全国各地的铁路同志们要求几件很小的事：第一，要响应全总与铁总的号召，开展大竞赛，提前完成一九五○年生产任务；第二，学习苏联工人的工作方法和英勇的精神；第三，消灭一切事故。今天我们当了家，做了主人，我们要在毛主席和共产党的领导下，很好的团结起来，把上级给我们的生产任务提前完成，为抗美援朝保家卫国而斗争。
