　　Combatting US-Chiang Kai-shek Conspiracy Sabotage:
    Anti-Rumor Struggle Unfolds Across Regions
    [Our Newspaper] US-Chiang Kai-shek special agents and reactionary secret societies, hidden in various regions, are conducting shameless rumor-mongering and sabotage activities under the command of US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. This is one of the ways US imperialism and the remaining Chiang bandits are attacking the Chinese people, attempting to disintegrate the people's will and undermine their happy lives.

    In response to the enemy's conspiracy, anti-rumor struggles have been launched in various regions. Workers from the Shenyang No. 1 and No. 5 Machine Factories, May First Factory, Smelting Factory, Fifty-Three Factory, Electrical Engineering Factory, and others held anti-rumor struggle meetings, exposing the true faces of the rumor-mongers on the spot. Confessions by rumor-mongers captured by our public security organs improved the masses' political consciousness. Han Zongyao, a statistician at the May First Factory, revealed at the meeting the facts of Chiang Kai-shek's special agent Zhang Weifu's past rumor-mongering and sabotage activities within the factory, making the masses aware of the bandit's shameless methods. Some workers said: "The special agents deceived me so badly! Because I fell for their rumors, I sold all my furniture." Everyone expressed their determination to unite, expose rumor-mongers. After the anti-rumor struggle, the production enthusiasm of the factory workers was greatly increased, and they voluntarily organized amateur propaganda teams and propaganda groups, using blackboards, wall newspapers, radio broadcasts, and discussion meetings to conduct regular current affairs propaganda to workers and their families, and to expose rumors at any time. The Shenhe District of Shenyang City held an anti-rumor meeting for over a thousand district representatives, resident group leaders, and street women representatives. The director of the district's Public Security Bureau exposed and criticized the rumor facts of bandit agent Liu Xinghan and others, arousing the anger of all the representatives. Women's representative Li Shude, filled with indignation, spoke of the harm that rumors had caused her. She said: "Because the bandit agents spread rumors, my whole family was ruined, and the boxes, cabinets, pots, bowls, and basins in my house were all sold, just preparing to escape." She trembled with anger as she spoke, and finally said: "Representatives, don't listen to rumors. I regret it now, but it's too late." The resident representatives unanimously expressed that they must strengthen current affairs propaganda, mobilize the masses to expose rumors, and track down rumor-mongers. The Huxi People's Printing Factory and Huxi State-Operated Cotton Weaving Factory in Shanghai successively held anti-special agent and anti-rumor meetings. The suburban work committee and suburban farmers' association of the city made thorough arrangements to smash counter-revolutionary rumors. First, they held an enlarged propaganda meeting, then convened a meeting of the propaganda ministers of the various CCP district committees, conducted research and discussion, and mobilized cadres at all levels, civil school teachers, and farmer activists to delve into the masses by holding discussions, individual propaganda, written propaganda, giving current affairs reports, and other means, to expose rumors and improve the masses' awareness. The farmers took the initiative to track down rumors, isolating the bad elements who spread them. Gu Xixian, a rich peasant in Hongqiao Township, initially listened to "Voice of America" rumors in his teahouse and spread rumors, which aroused the resentment of the masses who used to drink tea there, and they stopped going to his teahouse. In other townships such as Zhenru and Xinjing, after current affairs propaganda, the farmers not only stabilized their production enthusiasm, but also had a deeper understanding of the aggressive crimes of US imperialism. The armed self-defense team members in each district were also more eager to learn military techniques. Recently, the people of Shanghai exposed Zhou Zuowei, an intelligence agent for "Voice of America." The bandit Zhou fabricated rumors and sent them to the "US Consulate General" in Hong Kong for transmission to "Voice of America" for broadcast, and on the other hand, listened to "Voice of America" rumors and spread them among the masses. Currently, the people of all walks of life in Shanghai have proposed strictly prohibiting listening to "Voice of America" in order to eradicate the shameless rumors of US imperialism. In conjunction with the autumn grain requisition, Guode County in Guangxi Province held village meetings in each village to carry out current affairs propaganda. After the village meetings, the past popular rumors collapsed without being attacked. Many farmers said: "Chiang Kai-shek's millions of troops have been wiped out, how can he still have the ability to fight back? It's absolutely impossible." The Xijiao District Public Security Branch in Beijing, in order to smash the "child-snatching" rumors, after reaching a consensus among cadres and police officers, convened meetings of village cadres, activists, and mass discussion meetings, clarified the masses' thinking, and arranged to track down rumors and other work, making it impossible for rumor-mongers to carry out activities among the masses.

    In addition, Nanjing, Lanzhou, Dalian, Andong and other places have also launched current affairs propaganda to the people, exposing the rumor sabotage activities of US imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek's special agents.

　　打击美蒋阴谋破坏活动
    各地展开反谣言斗争
    【本报讯】暗藏在各地的美蒋特务、反动会门，在美帝及蒋匪帮指挥下，进行无耻的造谣破坏活动。这是美帝及残余蒋匪进攻中国人民的方式之一，他们企图以此来瓦解人民的斗志，破坏人民的幸福生活。
    针对敌人的阴谋，各地先后展开了反谣言斗争。沈阳市第一、第五机器厂、五一工厂、冶炼厂、五三工厂、电工等厂的职工，分头举行了反谣言斗争大会，当场揭露了造谣分子的真面目，并由被我公安机关捕获的造谣分子进行了坦白，提高了群众的政治觉悟。五一工厂的统计员韩宗耀，在大会上揭露了暗藏在厂内的蒋匪特务张维福历次造谣破坏的事实，使群众认识到匪特的无耻手段。有的工人说：“特务骗得我好苦啊！因为上了他们谣言的当，把家具都卖光了。”大家纷纷表示要团结起来，检举造谣分子。在反谣言斗争以后，各工厂职工的生产情绪大大提高，并主动地组织了业余宣传队及宣传小组，利用黑板报、墙报、广播、座谈会等形式，向职工及职工家属，进行经常的时事宣传，并随时揭露谣言。沈阳市沈河区召开了区代表、居民组长、街道妇女代表千余人的反谣言大会，该区公安局局长对匪特刘兴汉等九人的谣言事实，进行了揭露和批判，引起全体代表的愤怒。妇女代表李书德怀着满腔愤恨，诉说谣言给她的危害，她说：“因为匪特造谣，把俺闹的全家破产，把家里的箱子、柜、锅、碗、瓢、盆都卖光了，光准备着逃跑哩。”她说到这里，气得混身发抖，最后她说：“各位代表们千万不要听信谣言，我现在后悔也来不及了。”各居民代表一致表示，一定要加强时事宣传，发动群众揭露谣言，追查谣言。上海市沪西人民印制厂、沪西各国营棉织厂，都相继举行了反特反谣言大会。该市郊区工委及郊区农协对粉碎反革命谣言，曾作了周密布置。首先召开了一次扩大宣传会议，然后召开了各中共区委宣传部长会议，进行了研究和讨论，动员各级干部、民校教员、农民积极分子，根据宣传会议的精神，通过座谈会、个别宣传、文字宣传、作时事报告等方式层层深入，向群众揭发谣言，提高了群众觉悟，农民主动地发起追查谣言，使传播谣言的坏分子陷于孤立。虹桥乡的富农顾锡先，起先在自己开的茶馆里收“美国之音”的谣言给茶客听，并经常散布谣言，这次经群众揭发，引起过去常喝茶的群众的愤恨，都不去他那里喝茶了。其它如真茹、新泾等乡的农民，经过时事宣传，不但安定了生产情绪，而且更深刻地认识了美帝国主义的侵略罪行。各区的武装自卫队员，学习军事技术的要求也更加迫切。最近上海市的人民，检举了“美国之音”情报员周祚伟。周匪曾一面捏造谣言送交香港“美国总领事馆”转“美国之音”播发，另一方面又收听“美国之音”的谣言在群众中传播。目前上海市各界人民提出严格制止收听“美国之音”，以根绝美帝的无耻谣言。广西省果德县结合秋征，各村普遍召开了村民大会，进行时事宣传，经过村民大会后，过去流行的谣言，不攻自破了。很多农民都说：“蒋介石几百万军队都给消灭了，现在他还有本事打回来吗？绝对不可能的事。”北京市西郊区公安分局，为了粉碎“拍花”谣言，在打通干部、警士的思想后，召开了村干部、积极分子会议及群众座谈会，澄清了群众思想，并布置了追查谣言等工作。使造谣分子在群众中无法再行活动。
    此外，南京、兰州、大连、安东等地，亦已向人民展开时事宣传，揭露美帝、蒋匪特务分子的谣言破坏活动。
