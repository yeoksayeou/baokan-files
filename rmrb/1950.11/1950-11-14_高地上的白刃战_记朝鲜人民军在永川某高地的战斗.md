　　White Bayonet Fighting on the Heights
　　A Record of the Battle of the Korean People's Army on a Certain Height in Yongcheon

    The defensive battle in the Yongcheon area was an extremely fierce battle.

    A certain detachment of the Korean People's Army built a solid defensive position on a certain height twenty miles behind Yongcheon.

    The U.S. military bombarded the People's Army position with dozens of 155mm cannons and 105mm howitzers.

    Enemy planes, in formations of dozens, dropped bombs non-stop for two hours. The height was engulfed in flames, small hills were reshaped, and the People's Army trenches were destroyed.

    Some soldiers had their faces and necks burned by the flames and could hardly breathe. It was almost impossible to tell directions.

    The People's Army did not fire. The enemy thought the People's Army had been annihilated, so they surrounded the height and began to move. People's Army combatants used the explosion craters from enemy bombs and shells to reorganize their battle formation. Heavy machine gunners used rocks to cover their bodies, waiting for firing orders. The smoke and flames were still thick and difficult to aim through, but the combatants, hardened in battle, were able to overcome this difficulty.

    Five minutes, seven minutes, passed in extreme tension. Time passed slowly. The enemy could not immediately attack the height engulfed in flames, and they clustered together, cursing. People's Army combatants continued to maintain silence. Finally, the enemy began to climb up from all sides.

    Just then, the detachment leader appeared before the combatants and issued a call: "Comrades, the time has come to contribute our last drop of blood for the motherland and the leader! We must completely annihilate the enemy before us! We must hold this height until orders come from headquarters!" All the combatants recited the "Soldier's Oath" in low but powerful voices, responding to the call of the detachment leader.

    The signal flare for a simultaneous attack was finally launched. All the combatants opened fire on the enemy troops climbing up from the flames.

    The enemy, caught in a sudden burst of fire, fell to the ground. People's Army combatants continued to fire accurate shots. But the enemy, relying on their numerical superiority, refused to retreat, stubbornly resisted, and began firing wildly at our army.

    Enemy planes reappeared over the People's Army positions, strafing at low altitude. At this time, the voices of People's Army comrades shouting "Long live General Kim Il-sung!" before their heroic sacrifice were heard. Just then, the detachment leader shouted, "Brave comrades! Follow me! Charge!" and jumped out of the trench. After the detachment leader's order to charge, all the combatants shouted, "Long live!" and jumped out of the trenches together. Heavy machine gunners and light machine gunners picked up the guns and bayonets of their fallen comrades and also jumped out of the trenches, charging towards the enemy. People's Army warriors, burning with hatred for the enemy, ran down from the height and charged at the enemy.

    A melee ensued. The area around the height resounded with the sounds of charging and killing. The People's Army and the enemy forces were mixed together in fierce combat. The hateful enemy planes had to stop strafing.

    "Fight! For the motherland!" The battle cry of the combatants was constantly heard. They stepped over the bodies of their comrades and continued the bayonet fight with all their might. They did not have time to throw grenades or fire, so they used their rifle butts to strike and continued to stab with bayonets.

    Some enemy soldiers fell into the flames, some fell down the mountain, and blood stained the hillside. The stench of burning corpses choked the nose. The People's Army killed the numerically superior enemy forces, one after another. Bayonets broke, rifle butts were shattered, bullets ran out, and the combatants wrestled with the enemy.

    They punched the enemy, kicked them, and headbutted them. People's Army combatants grappled with six-foot-tall American soldiers and rolled down the mountain, continuing to fight. Facing death, the American imperialist mercenaries desperately struggled to the end. Many People's Army combatants had their ears bitten off by the enemy, but they still killed the enemy.

    This kind of hand-to-hand combat continued non-stop for eight hours. Both sides exhausted their strength. Some people fell, but after a while, they got up again and fought.

    The enemies finally began to flee. Exhausted People's Army combatants quickly snatched up the guns scattered nearby and fired at the enemy. The sun had already set over the western mountains.

    Grass stained with blood and burned, swayed heavily.

    In this way, the People's Army defended the height with blood.

　　高地上的白刃战
　  记朝鲜人民军在永川某高地的战斗
    永川地区的防御战是一场极激剧的战斗。
    朝鲜人民军某区分队在永川后方二十里地的某高地上建筑了坚固的防御阵地。
    美军以一五五厘米炮和一○五厘米迫击炮数十门轰击人民军阵地。
    敌人的飞机以数十架编队一分钟也不停地在两小时内投了一顿炸弹，高地被火焰包围着，小山都变了形状，人民军的战壕都被破坏了。
    有的战士们的脸和脖子都被火焰烧了，气也喘不过来。方向几乎辩不出了。
    人民军没有放枪，敌人以为人民军都被歼灭了，于是包围高地，开始行动。人民军战斗员们利用敌人炸弹和炮弹的爆炸坑整理了战斗队形。重机枪射手利用岩石掩蔽着身体等待射击命令。炮烟和火焰仍然浓厚难于瞄准。但在战斗中锻炼了的战斗员们，是能克服这一困难的。
    五分钟、七分钟，极度紧张地过去了。时间过的很慢。敌军不能立刻进攻被火焰包围着的高地，他们这里一起那里一起地密集在一块诅咒着。人民军战斗员们继续保守着沉默。终于，敌人由四方开始爬上来了。
    正当这时，区分队长出现在战斗员面前发出号召：“同志们，已到为祖国和领袖贡献出最后一滴血的时候了，我们一定要将眼前的敌人完全歼灭，我们一定要坚守这个高地直到指挥处有命令来的时候。”全体战斗员们低声但是有力地宣读着“军人宣誓”，响应了区分队长的号召。
    一齐射击的信号弹终于发出了。全体战斗员向那些从火焰里爬上来的敌军一齐开火了。
    敌人遭到突然的射击后都卧倒了。人民军战斗员们继续发着百发百中的子弹。但是敌人仗着数量上的优势，不愿退却，顽强地抵抗着，并疯狂地向我军开始了射击。
    敌人的飞机再次出现在人民军的阵地上，低空扫射。这时传来了人民军同志们壮烈牺牲前高喊的“金日成将军万岁！”的声音。正在这个时候，区分队长喊着“勇敢的同志们！跟着我来！冲锋啊！”一面喊着一面跳出战壕。区分队长的冲锋命令下来后，全体战斗员喊着：“万岁！”，一齐跳出了战壕。重机枪和轻机枪射手们，把牺牲的同志们的枪和刺刀接过来，也跟着跳出战壕，冲向敌人。人民军勇士们燃烧着敌忾心，从高地跑下来，向敌人冲去。
    肉搏战展开了，高地一带响遍了冲杀声，人民军和敌军混战在一起。可恶的敌机不得不停止扫射。
    “拚啊！为了祖国！”战斗员们的这种喊声不断的传来，他们越过战斗员们的尸体，用尽一切力量继续着白刃战。他们来不及扔出手榴弹和开火，就用枪托去打，用刺刀继续刺下去。
    敌军有的栽倒在火焰里，有的摔下山去，鲜血染满了山坡。被火烧着的尸体的臭气呛着鼻子。人民军将数量上占优势的敌军，杀死一个，再杀一个。刺刀折断了，枪托打碎了，子弹打完了，战斗员们抱着敌人搏斗着。
    用拳头打敌人，用脚踢，用头顶。人民军战斗员抱着身高六尺的美军滚下山去，继续搏斗着。面临着死亡的美帝雇佣兵们妄想着，挣扎到底。人民军很多战斗员被敌人咬断耳朵，但是仍然打死了敌人。
    这样的肉搏战，一分钟也不休息的继续了八小时。双方都使尽了力气，有些人栽倒了，但过一会再爬起来搏斗。
    敌人们终于开始逃跑了。疲累不堪的人民军战斗员很快就夺过散在附近的枪向敌人打过去。太阳已经从西山落下去了。
    沾满了鲜血被火烧剩的草沉重地摇摆着。
    这样，人民军以血坚守住了高地。
