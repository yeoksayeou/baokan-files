Study Dr. Bethune's Internationalist Spirit
Commemorating the Eleventh Anniversary of Dr. Bethune's Death

　　Dr. Norman Bethune was an outstanding Communist Party member. Born in Toronto, Canada, in 1891, he devoted his life to medical work for 35 years, becoming a world-renowned expert in pulmonary surgery. In 1937, when the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japan broke out, he was sent to China to serve by the Canadian and American Communist Parties. He arrived in Yan'an in April 1938 and reached the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region behind enemy lines on June 17th. He fulfilled his greatest responsibility in supporting the Chinese people's cause of liberation and unfortunately died in the line of duty at 5:20 AM on November 12, 1939. Chairman Mao told us: "A foreigner, with no selfish motive, regards the Chinese people's liberation cause as his own. What kind of spirit is this? This is the spirit of internationalism, the spirit of proletarianism. Every Chinese Communist Party member must learn from this spirit."

　　Comrade Bethune's achievements have left an indelible impression on all Chinese people. The CPC Central Committee called on all party members to learn from his internationalist spirit. In the liberated areas, especially among medical personnel, a fervent "Learn from Bethune" movement was launched, constantly producing a large number of model medical workers.

　　Today, as American imperialists are frantically waging a war of aggression in Korea and extending the flames of war to the Chinese border, the Chinese people have universally, angrily, and voluntarily launched a movement to resist America and aid Korea. Medical workers and personnel in other departments should take Bethune as a role model, display the noble spirit of internationalism, strike at the aggressive arrogance of American imperialists, and defend world peace.

　　学习白求恩大夫的国际主义精神
    白求恩大夫逝世十一周年纪念
    诺尔曼·白求恩大夫是一个优秀的共产党员。一八九一年生于加拿大脱朗托。他以毕生精力，从事医务工作有三十五年之久，成为世界著名的肺部外科专家。一九三七年中国人民抗日战争爆发，他受加拿大和美国共产党的派遣来中国服务。一九三八年四月到延安，六月十七日到达敌后晋察冀边区。他为支援中国人民解放事业，尽了最大的责任，于一九三九年十一月十二日晨五时二十分不幸以身殉职。毛主席告诉我们：“一个外国人，毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业，当作他自己的事业，这是什么精神，这是国际主义的精神，这是无产主义的精神，中国共产党员每个都要学习他这种精神。”
    白求恩同志的功绩在全中国人民中留下了不可磨灭的印象。中共中央曾号召全体党员学习他的国际主义精神，在各解放区，特别是医务人员，展开热烈的学习白求恩运动，不断涌现大批医务模范工作者。
    今天美帝国主义者疯狂地在朝鲜进行侵略战争，并把战火延烧到中国边境的时候，中国人民普遍地、愤怒地、自觉自愿地掀起抗美援朝的运动，在医务工作者及其他部门的工作人员，都应以白求恩为学习的榜样，发挥崇高的国际主义精神，打击美帝国主义者的侵略气焰，保卫世界和平。
