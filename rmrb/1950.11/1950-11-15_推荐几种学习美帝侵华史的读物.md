Recommending Several Readings for Studying the History of American Imperialism's Invasion of China
　　Yu Jie, Fan Baichuan
    In order to cooperate with the current movement to resist American aggression and aid Korea and defend the motherland, we should have a clear and profound understanding of the history of American imperialism's invasion of China. Here are several reference books on the history of American imperialism's invasion of China.

            "Imperialism and Chinese Politics"
　　Hu Sheng, published by Sanlian Bookstore
    "Imperialism and Chinese Politics" was first published in Hong Kong in May 1948. At that time, the major cities across the country had not yet been liberated. But today, when we read it, we do not feel that it is "outdated." On the contrary, the profound meaning it originally contained is even more significant.

    This book provides a profound and thorough analysis of the political relationship between the imperialist powers and semi-colonial China during the historical period from the Opium War to the eve of the Great Revolution of 1925. It helps us understand how imperialists—especially American imperialists—used various guises to deceive the Chinese people and to support reactionary rulers in order to invade China. And how our country’s "illusions of all political reformists about the imperialists have harmed the cause of the Chinese people's revolution."

    Some people think that among the imperialist powers, the American invasion of China is only a matter of recent years. But in fact, as early as 1840, it was an accomplice of British imperialism. The Sino-American Treaty of Wangxia in 1844 was signed by the United States, after the Treaty of Nanjing, by threatening the Qing government. This was one of the first unequal treaties to reduce China to a semi-colonial state. In this treaty, in addition to seizing the same interests in China as the British Empire after the opening of the five ports for trade, the United States further stipulated that "if other interests accrue to any country, the people of the United States shall share them equally." This vicious most-favored-nation clause that oppresses the Chinese people was initiated by the United States! Recognizing this is of great significance for exposing the so-called democratic mask of the United States in history.

    In 1894, after the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, the imperialist countries took the opportunity to divide China into "spheres of influence" and seize their own special rights. At that time, American imperialism was waging a colonial war with Spain for the Philippines and was, in fact, unable to take care of China. However, in 1899, it specifically put forward the slogan of the "Open Door," advocating that all countries should "share equally" in their interests in China. As the author points out: the so-called "Open Door" is nothing more than advocating that everyone should have a share in the imperialist aggression against China, and it is not opposed to the spheres of influence that have already been divided by various countries. Due to the situation at the time, no imperialist country was able to and dared to monopolize China, so everyone agreed to the American "Open Door" policy, thus forming a situation in which the imperialists jointly managed China. Some people think that other countries wanted to "partition" China at that time, and it was thanks to the proposal of the American imperialists that China was spared the danger of being "partitioned." This is completely contrary to the facts.

    Around the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, American imperialism, because it was impossible to spare a lot of power to directly interfere in Far Eastern affairs, cunningly adopted a policy of supporting Japan, extending its power to Taiwan and Korea through Japan, and attempting to establish a base for invading China. Unfortunately, this book lacks a more detailed explanation in this regard. The book points out that after the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, American imperialists were originally hoping to take the opportunity to gain a foothold in Northeast China. But because Japanese imperialism had already grown fat at that time, it wanted to monopolize the Northeast, which frustrated the "grand strategy" of the United States. From then on, the contradiction between Japan and the United States became the main link in the contradiction between imperialists competing for China. American imperialism has exhausted all methods to develop its power in Manchuria and used its economic power to become the hegemon in the imperialist group that invaded China. It can be seen that the current American imperialist invasion of Korea, coveting our Northeast, and attempting to swallow the whole of China are precisely the consistent attempts of American imperialism in history.

    American imperialists, like other imperialists, have tried their best to support and carry out their aggressive conspiracies through China's reactionary ruling class. This book tells us that American imperialism tried its best to please the corrupt and traitorous Qing government, regarding itself as its "good friend." The thief of the country, Yuan Shikai, was not only supported and utilized by Japanese imperialism, but also supported and utilized by American imperialism. For example, in order to support Yuan Shikai's reactionary position, the four-nation banking consortium of the United States, Britain, France, and Germany loaned money to Yuan Shikai's government. The then American minister, Reinsch, strongly advocated this loan, saying: "If the Beijing government (referring to Yuan Shikai's government—the author) cannot maintain itself due to financial difficulties, China may fall into a state of anarchy…And the cooperation of the powers to lend money to Yuan Shikai can also strike a blow at the arrogance of the South (referring to striking a blow against Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary forces in the South—the author)." For example, Dr. Goodnow (former professor at Columbia University and president of Johns Hopkins University) served as Yuan Shikai's government's political adviser and published "Republic and Monarchy," as the theoretical basis for Yuan Shikai's imperial movement. The author also tells us that since the establishment of the "Republic of China," American imperialism has been one of the main instigators of countless criminal acts in which the imperialists instigated the Northern Warlords' civil war, thereby seizing aggressive interests and power, causing serious damage to the Chinese people. For example, the Northern Warlords Cao Kun and Wu Peifu, who harmed the country and the people, were the running dogs of American imperialism. The United States gave them financial and military assistance, and helped them train air force teams and set up aircraft machinery factories. The United States also actively supported Cao Kun's bribery of the presidency. American imperialism is still shamelessly claiming that it is a "good friend" of China. Historically speaking, if it is said to be a "good friend" of all the most reactionary and corrupt ruling forces in modern Chinese history, that is not wrong at all.

    I want to recommend this book to the vast number of readers. It can help us recognize the insidious and vicious true face of American imperialists.

            "A Brief History of American Imperialism's Invasion of China"
　　Liu Danian, published by Xinhua Bookstore
    This book divides the history of American imperialism's invasion of China into four stages: 1. Following or invading China through other countries (1840-1905); 2. Gradually embarking on independent aggression against China (1905-1917); 3. Contending for hegemony in China (1917-1945); 4. Carrying out exclusive occupation of China (after 1945).

    In the first two chapters, the author gradually narrates the facts that the United States followed the British Empire and signed the Treaty of Wangxia with the Qing government, "sharing equally" the interests, and began extraterritoriality, helping the Qing government suppress the Taiping Revolution, helping and invading China through Japan, proposing the "Open Door" policy, suppressing the Boxer Movement, and starting to support Yuan Shikai's theft of the country, from following or invading China through other countries to embarking on independent aggression against China. In the third and fourth chapters, the author further analyzes the process of supporting reactionary warlords to suppress the people's revolutionary forces in order to compete with Japan for hegemony in China; and then, in the process of the development of the Chinese revolution, buying over Chiang Kai-shek, who mixed into the revolutionary ranks, to oppose the revolution, in order to carry out the conspiracy to exclusively occupy China.

    This book briefly narrates the historical process of American imperialism's invasion of China, exposing the mask and conspiracy of American imperialism's "helping" China.

            "A Short History of American Imperialism's Invasion of China"
　　Wang Minzhi, published by Sanlian Bookstore
    This book also divides the history of American imperialism's invasion of China into four stages, which are similar to the previous book, but the materials are slightly supplemented compared to the previous book.

    In the introduction, the author points out: "The United States imperialist's policy toward China for more than 100 years has been an aggressive policy in essence…that is, plundering and exploiting the Chinese people." The author further analyzes the characteristics of American imperialism's invasion of China: First, American imperialism "is good at using the power of other countries to achieve results and evade the responsibilities it should bear." Second, "is that it is good at using two-faced tactics." Third, "is that it is accustomed to sympathizing with the Chinese people and the Chinese revolutionary movement in words, but in fact it always supports the enemies of the Chinese people—the feudal ruling class, and helps the rulers suppress the Chinese people's revolutionary movement." Fourth, "is that it focuses on economic penetration and cultural aggression and pays relatively little attention to territorial occupation." (Of course, this is not because it is unwilling, but because it is limited by objective reasons. Now, this characteristic no longer exists.) In this way, the United States has deceived some people who do not open their eyes to see things, and created a small number of supporters of so-called "democratic individualism," who once falsely talked about what the United States had "helped" our country and expressed an attitude of "friendship" toward the Chinese people. But the broad masses of the Chinese people have understood enough about this kind of "help" and "friendship" for more than a hundred years.

            "Refuting Acheson"
　　Edited by Xinhua Current Affairs Series, published by Xinhua Bookstore
    On August 5, 1949, the United States Department of State published a "White Paper" entitled "China Relations," with a letter from U.S. Secretary of State Acheson to U.S. President Truman as the preface. Due to the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, the reactionary ruling forces of the United States and Chiang Kai-shek were driven out of the Chinese mainland. The United States had to admit the facts of aiding the bandits in the past and the shameful failure of the policy of aiding the bandits. It had to admit that the Kuomintang government had long lost the support of the people, and that the People's Liberation War led by the Chinese Communist Party was supported by the vast number of Chinese people. "Under such circumstances, our aid has been ineffective." However, American imperialists cannot learn from this shameful failure. Instead, they reverse black and white, slander the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party, and declare that they will still not relax their efforts to continue undermining the democratic cause of the Chinese people from inside and outside China, and seek help from the so-called supporters of "democratic individualism."

    This book collects some articles refuting Acheson that were published in newspapers at that time, thoroughly exposing the essence of American imperialism's aggression, which can help us recognize the essence of American aggression.

　　推荐几种学习美帝侵华史的读物
　　俞杰　樊百川
    为着配合目前抗美援朝，保卫祖国的运动，我们对美帝侵华的历史应该有明确深刻的认识，特将几种有关美帝侵华历史的参考书介绍在下面。                                                    
            “帝国主义与中国政治”  
　　胡绳著  三联书店版
    “帝国主义与中国政治”一九四八年五月在香港初版，当时全国各主要城市还没有解放，可是我们今天来读它，非但没有“过时”了的感觉，它原来涵有的深切意义，反而更加显著了。
    本书把从鸦片战争到一九二五年大革命前夕这一历史时期中帝国主义列强与半殖民地中国之间的政治关系，作了深刻透彻的分析。它使我们认识帝国主义者——特别是美帝国主义，怎样用各种不同的姿态来欺骗中国人民，来扶持反动统治者，借以对中国进行侵略。而我国“一切政治改良主义者对于帝国主义者的幻想，曾怎样地损害了中国人民革命事业。”
    有些人以为，在帝国主义列强中，美帝侵略中国只不过是近几年的事。但是，事实上早在一八四○年，它便是英帝国主义的帮凶，一八四四年的中美《望厦条约》，就是继《南京条约》之后，美国以恫吓威胁的手段强迫满清政府签订的。这是使中国降为半殖民地的最初的不平等条约之一。在这个条约中，美帝除了攫取到五口通商后英帝在中国同样的利益之外，更规定了“如另有利益及于各国，合众国人民应一体均沾。”这种压迫中国人民的凶恶的最惠国条款，正是由美帝开端的！认识这一点，对于揭穿美帝历史上所谓民主的假面具是有着重要的意义的。
    一八九四年，中日甲午之战后，各帝国主义国家乘机在中国划分“势力范围”，攫取各自的特殊权利。当时美帝国主义正在与西班牙进行争夺菲律宾的殖民战争，事实上无暇顾及中国，可是在一八九九年，它特别提出了“门户开放”的口号，主张各国在华“利益均沾”。正如作者所指出：所谓“门户开放”，无非是主张帝国主义侵略中国的利益应该人人有份，并不是反对各国已经划分的势力范围。由于当时的形势，没有一个帝国主义国家能够和敢于独占中国，所以大家都同意美帝的“门户开放”政策，因而形成了帝国主义者共管中国局面。有人以为当时别的国家都想“瓜分”中国，靠着美帝国主义者的提议才使中国免于被“瓜分”的危险，那是完全违反事实的。
    美帝国主义在甲午之战前后，由于不可能分出很多力量来直接干涉远东事务，所以狡猾地采取了扶植日本的政策，通过日本来伸展其势力于台湾、朝鲜，企图建立侵略中国的基础。可惜在这方面，本书中缺少比较详细的说明。本书指出，在一九○四年的日俄之战后，美帝国主义者本来满心以为可以乘机插足中国的东北，但由于日本帝国主义在当时已经养肥了，它自己想独占东北，使得美帝的“雄图大略”受到了挫折。从此以后，日美间的矛盾就成为帝国主义者争夺中国的矛盾中的主要一环。美帝国主义曾用尽方法，想向满洲发展势力，并凭借它的经济势力在侵略中国的帝国主义集团中做霸主。由此可见，现在美帝国主义的侵略朝鲜，觊觎我东北，并图吞噬全中国，这正是美帝国主义在历史上的一贯企图。
    美帝国主义者也和别的帝国主义者一样，竭力扶植和通过中国的反动统治阶级来进行其侵略阴谋。本书告诉我们，美帝国主义曾努力讨好腐败卖国的满清政府，把自己当作他的“好朋友”。窃国大盗袁世凯，不只受过日本帝国主义的支持利用，也受过美帝国主义的支持和利用，例如为了支持袁世凯的反动地位，美英法德四国银行团曾贷款给袁世凯政府，当时的美国公使芮恩施极力主张这种贷款，说：“倘北京政府（指袁世凯政府—笔者）因财政困难而不能维持，则中国或将陷于无政府状态。……且列强合作借款予袁世凯，亦可对中国南方之气焰与以打击（指对孙中山在南方的革命势力与以打击—笔者）。”又如美国人古德诺博士（曾任哥伦比亚大学教授、霍浦金斯大学校长）作袁世凯政府的政治顾问，发表了“共和与君主论”，作为袁世凯进行帝制运动的理论根据。作者又告诉我们，“民国”成立以来，帝国主义者策动北洋军阀混战，从而攫取侵略利益和势力，使中国人民受着严重损害的无数罪恶行动中，美帝国主义是主要策动者之一。例如：祸国殃民的北洋军阀曹锟、吴佩孚，就是美帝国主义的走狗。美帝曾给以财政上、军火上的种种援助，并助其训练飞机队，设立飞机机械厂；对于曹锟的贿选总统，美帝也是积极支持的。美帝国主义至今还厚颜无耻地自称他是中国的“好朋友”，就历史而言，如果说它是中国近代史上一切最反动腐朽的统治势力的“好朋友”，那倒是一点也不错的。
    我要把这本书推荐给广大的读者。它可以帮助我们认识美帝国主义者阴险狠毒的真面目。
            “美国侵华简史”
　  刘大年著  新华书店出版
    本书将美帝侵华的历史，分为四个阶段：一、追随或通过别国向中国侵略（一八四○——一九○五年）；二、逐渐走上独立侵略中国（一九○五——一九一七年）；三、争夺中国霸权（一九一七——一九四五年）；四、进行独占中国（一九四五年以后）。
    在第一二两章中，作者逐步叙述了美帝从追随英帝而与清政府订立“望厦条约”，“均沾”利益，并开始治外法权以来，帮助满清政府镇压太平革命运动，帮助并通过日本侵略中国，提出“门户开放”政策，镇压义和团运动，开始扶植袁世凯窃国，由追随或通过别国对华的侵略，走上独立侵华的事实。在第三四两章中，更分析了从支持反动军阀镇压人民革命势力，以与日本争夺中国霸权；并进而在中国革命形势发展的过程中，收买混进革命队伍的蒋介石来反对革命，以遂行独占中国的阴谋。
    这本书简明的叙述了美帝侵华的历史过程，揭发了美帝“帮助”中国的假面具和阴谋。
            “美国侵华小史”  
　　汪敏之著  三联书店出版
    本书也将美帝侵华的历史分为四个阶段，与前书大同小异，材料比前书稍有补充。
    作者在导言中指出：“美帝国主义一百多年以来的对华政策，在本质上是侵略的政策。……即掠夺剥削中国人民的本质。”进一步分析了美帝侵华的特征：第一，美帝“善于利用别国的力量取得成果，而逃避应负的责任。”第二，“是它善于运用两面派的手法。”第三，“是它惯于在口头上同情中国的人民，同情中国的革命运动，而在实际上它是永远支持中国人民的敌对者——封建统治阶级，帮助统治者镇压中国人民的革命运动。”第四，“是它侧重于经济渗透及文化侵略而比较不注重领土的占领。”（这当然不是它不愿意，而是受客观原因的限制。到现在，这一特征已经不存在了。）这样美帝曾欺骗了一部分不睁开眼看事情的人，造就了一小部分的所谓“民主个人主义”的拥护者，曾经妄谈什么美国对我国曾有“帮助”，对中国人民曾表示过“友谊”的态度，但是广大的中国人民百余年对于这种“帮助”和“友谊”已经领会得够了。
            “驳斥艾奇逊”
　　新华时事丛刊社编  新华书店出版
    美国国务院于一九四九年八月五日发表了一篇题为“中美关系”的“白皮书”，并以美国国务卿艾奇逊给美国总统杜鲁门的一封信作为序文。由于中国人民解放战争的伟大胜利，美蒋反动的统治势力被驱逐出中国大陆，美帝不得不供认过去援匪的事实和援匪政策的可耻的失败，不得不承认国民党政府早已失去人民的支持，和中国共产党所领导的人民解放战争为中国广大人民所拥护，“在这种情形下，我们的援助至于无效。”但是美帝国主义者并不能从这种可耻的失败经验中吸取教训，反而颠倒黑白，诋毁中国人民和中国共产党，并宣称它将仍不放松从中国内部和外部继续破坏中国人民民主事业的努力，而求助于所谓“民主个人主义”的拥护者。
    本书收集当时报纸上驳斥艾奇逊的一些论文，彻底揭穿了美帝国主义的谎言，可以帮助我们认识美帝侵略的本质。
