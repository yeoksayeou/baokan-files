Xinhua News Agency, New York: Flatcher, acting chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the American Delegation to the Second World Peace Congress, told reporters on the 14th that the US State Department had refused to issue passports to Paul Robeson Jr., son of the famous black king Paul Robeson, and to Dameo, a responsible member of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America. They are American delegates to the Second World Peace Congress. Flatcher emphasized that the State Department's action was "a completely arbitrary act of a police state." He said that the UN Declaration of Human Rights contains provisions for freedom of travel and association, and that the US government, although it voted in favor of the declaration, has in practice violated it.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 14th: According to a Ceteka dispatch citing a report from Dentsu, Marinello, chairman of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, a famous writer and scientist, recently gave a statement to a Dentsu reporter protesting his unreasonable imprisonment by the Cuban police authorities. Marinello pointed out that the recent actions by the Cuban government to arrest and imprison several Cuban, Mexican, and Brazilian delegates who passed through Havana, the capital of Cuba, to attend the Second World Peace Congress fully demonstrate the extent to which the Cuban government is dependent on the United States. More than 700,000 people in Cuba, accounting for 75 percent of the country's population, have signed the peace declaration. Their determination to defend peace and fight for freedom has greatly alarmed the Cuban authorities.

Marinello commented on the British government's use of police measures to persecute delegates attending the Second World Peace Congress, saying that this not only demonstrates the stupidity of the British government, but also tells the world where the enemies of peace are and how to fight them in the best way.

　　美政府拒发护照给和大代表
    违反联合国人权宣言
    古巴人民社会党主席马利涅格抗议古政府无理监禁和大代表
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：美国出席第二届世界保卫和平大会代表团筹备委员会代理主席弗莱启，十四日告报界称：美国务院已拒发出国护照给著名黑人之王保罗·罗伯逊之子小罗伯逊，及统一电气与无线电工人工会的负责人员戴美欧。他们是美国出席第二届世界保卫和平大会的代表。弗莱启强调称：国务院的这种行动，完全是“警察国家的专横行为”。他说：联合国人权宣言中载有旅行与交往自由的条文，美国政府虽曾经投票赞成这个宣言，却在实际上违反了它。
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社布拉格十四日电引电通社消息，古巴人民社会党主席、著名作家与科学家马利涅格，顷向电通社记者发表谈话，抗议古巴警察当局无理将其监禁。马利涅格指出：最近古巴政府逮捕并监禁经过古巴首都哈瓦那出席第二届世界保卫和平大会的古巴、墨西哥及巴西的若干代表的行为，充分表明了古巴政府依附美国的深度。古巴七十余万人民，即占全国人口百分之七十五的人民，已在和平宣言上签了名。他们决心保卫和平与争取自由的行动，已使古巴当局大感恐慌。
    马利涅格评论英国政府采取警察措施迫害出席第二届世界和平大会的代表称：这不仅表现了英国政府的愚蠢，并且也向全世界说明和平的敌人在什么地方，并应如何用最好的方式来和他们进行斗争。
