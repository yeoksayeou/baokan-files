　　Two Angry Bullets
    Xiao Feng·Li Wen
    The American bandits invaded Korea and extended their demonic claws to our doorstep, arousing the anger of the people of Ranzhuang Village, Qingyuan County, Hebei Province.

    The people of Ranzhuang Village fought against the Japanese devils and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang for a full eleven years during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War. The militiamen of Ranzhuang Village earned the glorious title of "Model Militia Team." When they—the indomitable militia heroes—heard that the poisonous claws of American imperialism had intruded on our northeastern border, their anger was beyond description.

    Wang Jiufu, a model militiaman who had killed eighty enemies and obtained twenty guns, said: "In order to defend our homes and the country, we used to fight all over Baonan (the area south of Baoding), helped the militia of Jiangzhuang defeat the 'Puppet Army,' and helped the militia of Linshui Village defeat the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army. Now we must do the same as before, to help the Korean people defeat the American bandits. Korea is our close neighbor. We cannot let the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army burn and loot Linshui Village, and we cannot let the American devils encroach on Korea. The principle is the same."

    Zhang Honglin, the militia captain, said indignantly: "The United States is too blind. China is not the China of the past, just as our Ranzhuang is not the Ranzhuang of the past." Indeed, twelve years ago, when they started fighting the Japanese devils, they only had two "Jue" guns (old-fashioned pistols for only sons) and two matchlock guns. Later, they added landmines, dug tunnels, and exchanged them for Japanese and American big guns. In those difficult years, they never left this land, fought more than 1,300 battles, large and small, and killed more than 300 enemies.

    Like the militiamen of every village, these heroic people were tempered in battle. Their peaceful and happy life was also bought with blood in battle. Militiaman Li Gui still carries a bullet fired by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army in his arm, and Zhang Honglin still carries a scar on his waist. Therefore, they especially cherish the happy days now. You see, it is early winter now. Although the crops have been harvested and the land has been plowed, Ranzhuang is still as busy as in the wheat harvest season. Chaff is being cut and adobe bricks are being made. Twenty cotton gins are spinning non-stop, and more than forty families are making vermicelli. In every family's yard, two or three big fat pigs are constantly sticking their snouts into the slurry trough. Large flocks of ducks are in the ever-flowing Clear Water River, and there are endless chickens on the threshing ground. Old people holding babies are crowding into the pharmacy to listen to the doctor read the newspaper, so that they can free up the women's hands to make cotton clothes. At night, they can light gas lamps for meetings and study. Twelve years ago, most of the militiamen were not married, but now most of them have children. This year alone, Ranzhuang has added seventy-three infants, and eleven young couples have been newly married in the same period. Militiamen Li Heiguo, Li Liangeng, and Li Hengshu, who have just had sons, all say: For the sake of our children, we must resolutely defend our good life.

    For the two thousand acres of land distributed to all the farmers, and for the prosperous scene of both people and wealth, they know exactly how to deal with the enemy.

    On the evening of November 14th, the militiamen of the Ranzhuang Model Militia Team, wearing their glorious titles, decided to write to the Korean People's Guerrilla, telling them of their determination to resist America and aid Korea to defend their homes and the country. The militia instructor said to the militia comrade who was writing the letter: "Write: We hope you will turn every village into a fortress and every person into a soldier." Wang Jiufu said: "Write again: Don't think the American devils have good equipment. They are just straw bags. As long as you hit them hard, they will hand over their good equipment like the Kuomintang did." They wrote a long letter that could not be read in half a day. Finally, they put two bullets in a comfort bag and sent it to the Korean guerrillas. They said, this is just a token of our appreciation. They wrote on the letter: "This American-made 7.9mm bullet was seized from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army. You must use it to pierce the head of the American devils. This 38-type bullet was seized from the Japanese devils. You use it to pierce the head of the Li Seung-man bandit army." Let the bullets carry their hatred for the American bandits and their eleven years of experience in fighting the enemy to pierce the heads of the enemy!

    In the militia unit, a large number of comfort letters sent by men, women, old and young in the village, and a large number of comfort bags sewn by women automatically, were piled up. The bags were filled with peanuts, red dates, and heartfelt letters. They are willing to select militia representatives to send them to Korea in person. Like supporting their own army, they embroidered red characters on the comfort bags: "Support the Front." They call the Korean People's Army "Dear Comrades" just like they call their own People's Liberation Army. They wrote in the letter: "In Ranzhuang, there are Zhang Yanchun, Li Xianying, and Ren Yuhua, and thousands of women hate the American devils' aggression against our two countries. We admire your heroic resistance against the enemy. We will always be with you and swear to defeat our common enemy."

    Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the people of Ranzhuang Village, with a glorious history of fourteen years of struggle, like all the more than 40,000 villages in Hebei, had a whole company of people join the army to resist the enemy for the sake of today's good life. They said: "Still for the sake of today's good life, we still have a whole company of militiamen preparing for battle."

    This anger, hatred, and strength tell American imperialism that the Chinese people cannot be humiliated, and the people of the world cannot be humiliated.

　　两颗愤怒的子弹
    肖枫·力文
    美国强盗侵略朝鲜，又把魔手伸到我国门口，激起了河北省清苑县冉庄村人民的愤怒。
    冉庄村的人民，在抗日战争和人民解放战争时期，和日本鬼子及蒋匪帮整整搏斗了十一年。冉庄村的民兵们得到了“模范民兵队”的光荣称号。当他们——百折不挠的民兵英雄们听到美帝国主义的毒爪闯向我东北国境线上的时候，他们的愤怒的情绪是无法可以形容的。
    曾经打死八十个敌人、得过二十支枪的民兵模范王九福说：“为了保家卫国，过去咱们打遍了保南（保定以南的地区），帮助姜庄的民兵打退了“皇协军”，帮助林水村的民兵打退了蒋匪军，现在也要像过去一样，去帮助朝鲜人民打退美国强盗。朝鲜是咱们的近邻，咱们既不能让蒋匪军烧抢林水村，就不能让美国鬼子侵害朝鲜。这个道理是一样的。”
    民兵队长张洪林愤慨地说：“美国太不开眼了，中国不是过去的中国，正和咱们冉庄也不是过去的冉庄一样。”真的，十二年前当他们开始和日本鬼子斗争时，才有两支决枪（打独子的旧式手枪），两根火枪。后来添上地雷，挖了地道，换来了日本和美国的大枪。在艰苦的岁月里，他们没有离开过这块土地，大小干了一千三百多仗，打死了三百多个敌人。
    像每个村庄的民兵一样，英雄的人民是从战斗中锻炼出来的。他们和平与幸福的生活，也是从战斗中用血换来的。民兵李贵的膀子里还带着蒋匪军打的子弹，张洪林的腰里还带着伤疤。所以他们特别珍贵现在幸福的日子。你看，此刻正是初冬，庄稼虽然收了，地虽然耕了，冉庄还像麦秋一样忙碌，又铡草、又打坯，二十架轧花车在不停地转动，四十多家在漏粉条。谁家园里不是两三个大肥猪整天把嘴巴伸在浆槽里。四季长流的清水河里有大群鸭子，场边有赶不尽的母鸡。老人抱着娃娃挤在药铺里听医生读报，以便腾出女人的手来赶作棉衣。入夜，他们能够点上汽灯开会，学习。十二年前的民兵，多数还没有结婚，现在多数都有了孩子。只今年，全冉庄就添了七十三个幼儿，在同一期间就有十一对青年男女新婚。刚添了儿子的民兵李黑锅、李连庚、李恒书都说：为着孩子，我们要坚决保卫我们的好日子。
    为着全体农民分得的两千亩土地，为着人财两旺的好光景，他们完全知道用什么方法去对付敌人。
    十一月十四日晚上，戴着光荣称号的冉庄模范民兵队的民兵们决定把他们抗美援朝保家卫国的意志，写信告诉朝鲜人民游击队，民兵指导员对正在执笔写信的民兵同志说：“写上：盼望你们把每个村庄都变成堡垒，把每一个人都变成兵。”王九福说：“再写上：别看美国鬼子的家伙好，他人草包，只要狠狠地打，他们就像国民党一样把好家伙缴出来。”他们写了一封半天也读不完的长信。最后，把两颗子弹装进慰问袋里，送给朝鲜游击队。他们说，这是咱们的一点意思。在信上写道：“这颗美国造的七九子弹是我们从蒋匪军手里夺来的，你们要用它穿透美国鬼子的脑袋。这颗三八子弹，是从日本鬼子手里夺来的，你们用它穿透李承晚匪军的脑袋。”子弹带着他们对美寇的仇恨，带着他们和敌人搏斗十一年的经验去射穿敌人的脑袋吧！
    在民兵部队里，堆起了全村男女老少送来的大批慰问信，和妇女们自动缝制的大批慰问袋。袋里装满了花生、红枣和写心腹话的书信。他们愿选派民兵代表亲手送往朝鲜。他们像支援自己的军队一样，在慰问袋上绣上红字：“支援前线”。他们像称呼自己的解放军一样来呼唤朝鲜人民军为“亲爱的同志”。他们在信上写道：“在冉庄有张艳春、有李宪英、有任玉花，有千百妇女仇恨美国鬼子对你我两国的侵略。我们佩服你们英勇抗敌，我们永远和你们在一起，誓死打败我们共同的敌人。”
    在毛主席领导下，有着十四年光荣斗争史的冉庄村人民，像河北所有四万多个农村一样，为着今天的好日子，过去有整整一连人参军抗敌，他们说：“还是为着今天的好日子，我们还有整整一连民兵在准备战斗。”
    这愤怒、仇恨和力量，告诉美帝国主义，中国人民不可侮，世界人民不可侮。
