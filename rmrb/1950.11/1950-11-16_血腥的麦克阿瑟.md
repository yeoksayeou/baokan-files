　　Bloody MacArthur
　　Markov

　　General MacArthur said of himself, "I am a darling of destiny." We have heard this statement before, because that mad corporal who committed suicide by eating rat poison used to say it. Douglas MacArthur, Hitler's disciple, will face the shameful death of a murderer hated by the people, judged by the people's court.

　　As humanity prepares the indictment against him, this arrogant madman tries to portray himself as an "instrument of prophecy." Once, when an article published in the "Japan Times" said that the Japanese people should not treat MacArthur like God, the general was so angry that he ordered all the newspapers to be burned. The fact that MacArthur, whom the Asian people call the "white-faced emperor of Japan," is not an "instrument of destiny" but an instrument of American bankers has become even clearer to the world.

　　MacArthur had long relied on his inherent savage brutality, hatred of the people, utilitarianism, hypocrisy, and greed for profit to gain the favor of his American masters. Wall Street considers him the greatest expert on Asia: almost half a century ago, he personally killed the first "Asian"! This happened at the beginning of this century, when American imperialists were brutally massacring the Filipino people who were fighting for their national independence. That massacre was led by MacArthur's father, General Arthur MacArthur.

　　An American historian wrote: "Our soldiers never captured prisoners, never carried out any registration, they just ran around the country quickly, and if they encountered an adult Filipino on the road, they would kill him."

　　Second Lieutenant MacArthur also ran all over the country. He met the first fallen Filipino youth and fired all six bullets at him. Later, MacArthur told his fellow millionaire, Cromwell: "How many bullets can these people endure? I gained a new understanding of this question. I turned his back over, I put my hand on his chest, and I could feel all six bullets. They were lined up tightly one after another."

　　MacArthur was successfully promoted. He had been the "youngest regimental commander" and later became the "youngest division commander" in the US military. But this was not enough for him. He wanted to be the youngest general. In 1922, MacArthur married a woman who inherited a large fortune – the stepdaughter of millionaire Stotsbury, one of the closest confidants of the largest Morgan Bank. Soon after, MacArthur's father-in-law pounded the table and lobbied another banker, then US Secretary of War Weeks, to promote MacArthur to Major General. After a few more years, in 1930, MacArthur was promoted to Army Chief of Staff on Morgan's advice.

　　Known by American workers as "Morgan's General," he behaved very "honorably" in his new position. In 1932, he carried out his first original "military operation."

　　... The "enemy" attacked the capital. Thousands of unemployed people – veterans of World War I – came to the White House with their ragged, hungry wives and children to demand the bonuses that had already been promised. The heroic MacArthur did not panic! He commanded a battalion of the 12th Infantry Regiment, a squadron of the 3rd Cavalry Regiment, a tank platoon, and the staff company of the 16th Brigade to attack the unarmed people. MacArthur reported at the time: "Although the enemy had an average of five or six to one majority, the mobs trembled before our irresistible power. The energetic army, well-equipped technology, strict discipline and concerted action on the scene guaranteed our victory over any crowd attack."

　　All of MacArthur's skills, all his "military genius," all his "political philosophy" are in this "victory." Here also lies his special hatred for the people – the common people – and his terror before all organized mass actions (he believes: "The common people are full of revolutionary spirit and will endanger the foundation of the country"). Here also lies the bestial cruelty and the habit of trusting in the "absolute superiority" of force. The general's inherent affectation and bragging habit were also demonstrated at that time. MacArthur delayed the "battle" for an hour in order to put on a well-fitting uniform and hang badges all over his chest. Later in his career, he spent a lot of time studying the style of his gold-edged military cap, the strange gold-embroidered uniform, and the short coat with the word "MacArthur" embroidered on the pocket.

　　MacArthur summarized his experience in massacring the unemployed into a special military regulation. Let's introduce some of his "scientific" methods for resolving strikes. The most important rule in the method is "deliberate killing." An American veteran recalled that Hawaii conducted several exercises in 1933 under MacArthur's orders. Each unit was divided into two groups: one group dressed in old military uniforms and acted as unarmed "strikers," and the other group armed with guns – the generals' "legal and orderly army." The army used bayonets to kill the "strikers," who had no right to resist and had to flee.

　　The economic crisis of 1929-1933 shook the United States, causing an unprecedented upsurge in the workers' movement. At that time, the bosses of Wall Street thought: who is the "powerful figure" who can sanction the "common people"? Of course, they thought of MacArthur. The "hero" who crushed the hungry army of unemployed, then attempted to show off his skills in another cause – leading the fascist forces in Washington, with the aim of overthrowing the Roosevelt government and establishing a MacArthur government to replace it. Morgan's banks, steel trusts, Standard Oil, General Motors, and other uncrowned monarchs of the United States all supported this tested and meritorious candidate. However, the attempt to establish a fascist dictatorship in the country failed at the last moment – one of the conspirators leaked the secret, and the people tore up those reactionary plans.

　　This failed American "Fuhrer" was transferred to the Philippines. The Morgan family's interest in the Philippines was growing stronger, just like investment in land. The commander of the Philippine army was Douglas MacArthur. He was not very concerned about the islands entrusted to him. He was single-mindedly busy consolidating his private property. The commander appeared to be an outstanding speculator. He became a partner of the two largest capitalists in the Philippines – Soriano and Elizalde – and he bought shares in the Ako Hai Chromium Mine, the Antamok Gold Mine, and many other mining companies. He also acquired vast tracts of land, and finally, he indulged in businesses such as brewing beer and running restaurants, which were so incompatible with the golden general epaulettes.

　　During the US-Japan War, the biggest blow MacArthur suffered was not the defeat that brought him shame, but the loss of his enterprises that fell into the hands of the Japanese. After the war, he demanded no more and no less than exactly $4,695,708 in "military loss compensation" for himself and for his brewery partners. MacArthur had already received almost half of this amount. The gold sands, mines, factories and farms of the Philippines continued to bring dividends to MacArthur and other masters of the "independent Philippines."

　　MacArthur was transferred from Manila to Tokyo – to "Philippinize" Japan. He first engaged in his own private affairs: buying shares in the largest shipping company, "Nippon Yusen Kaisha," opening profitable department stores, and embezzling the most valuable works of art that he could get his hands on, etc. His service to the Morgan family and the smaller representatives of the Wall Street dynasty is incalculable. He used his position as the actual ruler of the United States to create truly unprecedented possibilities for American monopoly capital to plunder the Japanese economy.

　　MacArthur's hypocrisy is no less than that of other high-level American activists today. He, just like Truman, made lengthy nonsense "for the audience," almost always composed of the words "freedom," "democracy," "ideals," "God," "progress," and "civilization." But this hypocritical general instantly revealed his original form – in fact, he was exactly – the robber general. MacArthur paid close attention to Japanese democrats, and not long ago he explained: "The only way to deal with these people is to punch them in the nose until they bleed."

　　In Japan, "democratized" by MacArthur, more than 1,200 progressive newspapers were closed. Thousands of trained American detectives searched day and night for communist leaders. Military courts sentenced Japanese patriots to hard labor every day. As reported in the official gazette not long ago, Masao Kasuga, a member of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, was arrested by the police and subjected to "minor torture."

　　MacArthur is destroying peaceful industries and sheltering cannon capitalists. He is determined to restore the Japanese samurai army. The "theorists" and practitioners of bacteriological warfare are receiving MacArthur's paternal care. The naturally petty MacArthur calls all of this his "greatest and perhaps most precious achievement."

　　The darkest chapter has now been added to MacArthur's heinous war criminal career: Korea. This MacArthur – the Governor-General of American imperialism in the Far East – relies on American monopoly capital to achieve the supreme leadership of the colonization of South Korea. This general's speculative activities in South Korea are the same as in Japan and the Philippines. He first "pleased a native": Morgan Bank tasted some of the most palatable delicacies in Korea – mines, land, and banks with a huge capital of $1.25 billion, formerly occupied by the Japanese "Oriental Development Company."

　　MacArthur prepared everything for the Syngman Rhee puppet to attack North Korea, sent him the signal to invade, and then he became the commander of the robber army composed of all kinds of hairy interferers. He suffered many defeats, so his ruthlessness and barbarity were particularly prominent when destroying peaceful cities and villages and shooting people of all colors.

　　Any soldier and sailor who has served under MacArthur knows that this agile bureaucrat has never truly defeated an enemy equal in strength to him anytime, anywhere. A World War II veteran, a simple American named Thomson, aptly said of MacArthur: "Wall Street's pro-fascist imperialists fabricated a legend about MacArthur's military genius because they needed a knight in shining armor to lead their march to enslave the various colored peoples of Asia and Africa."

　　A Japanese proverb says: "When the wolf is about to take its last breath, it still thinks of swallowing lambs." The despicable imperialist beast MacArthur is trying to be a zombie. Every corner of the world is talking about the name of this seventy-year-old vampire MacArthur with contempt and hatred. But the Asian people still have a special bill to open for MacArthur.

　　The despicable saying "Oriental wisdom only respects the master's whip" came from his – MacArthur's – dog's mouth. His Tokyo staff has become a nest of war-mongers, compiling despicable conspiracies against freedom-loving people.

　　It was MacArthur himself who revealed his plundering plan – the plan of American imperialism. In a letter sent to the Chicago "Overseas Veterans" Association at the end of August, this executioner general called the Pacific a "American lake." MacArthur declared that the United States would seize China's Taiwan and turn it into an "unsinkable aircraft carrier." He fantasized that one day the United States could rule all the Asian seaports from "Vladivostok to Singapore."

　　As is well known, Mr. Truman was a little scared when he saw that his general was too frank, so he forbade the newspapers from publishing his letter. A month and a half later, Truman personally ran to Wake Island, ten thousand kilometers away from the American coast, to comfort MacArthur. MacArthur's program, although not suitable for publication in newspapers, is also fully in line with the intentions of American imperialists.

　　MacArthur, who is a deep enemy of the Soviet people, openly called for a "preemptive" anti-Soviet war.

　　Publicity personnel who collect money from Wall Street often call MacArthur "a symbol of the American nation." The facts are not at all like this. The simple people of the United States know MacArthur's true value very well. When Wall Street's fascist groups recommended him as a candidate for US president in 1948, the people said their "no" extremely firmly and clearly. MacArthur was defeated in the first election in Wisconsin; his supporters wanted to try to put his name on the list of candidates in California, but they could not even collect enough signatures on that "request."

　　MacArthur has a pioneer – a similar figure in history. But this is not Napoleon, the Tokyo murderer cannot be compared with Napoleon. This is another Frenchman – General Galliffet, the bloody executioner of the Paris Commune. He gained social status by marrying the daughter of a wealthy banker, which is similar to MacArthur; he was noticed by the rich government because of his outstanding cruelty in personally massacring "rioters," which is also similar to MacArthur. He was immersed in the blood of the Paris Commune, and thus gained high positions in the army and military administration. He also made a fortune in many colonial wars. These points are also similar to MacArthur.

　　When Marx thought of the robbers of the Paris Commune, he wrote that history would nail them to "that shameful signpost, and all the prayers of their monks could not save them from this signpost." Today's stranglers of freedom and democracy – the American imperialists and their police dogs – the bloody war-monger MacArthur is to be subject to a more severe judgment by mankind.

　　血腥的麦克阿瑟
    马尔科夫
    麦克阿瑟将军在谈到自己的时候说道：“我是命运的宠儿”。这句话，我们从前是听到过的，因为那一位吃了鼠药自杀的疯狂的伍长惯说这句话。希特勒的高足——杜格拉斯·麦克阿瑟日后可就要碰到人民法庭判决人民所憎恨的凶手的耻辱的死了。
    当人类准备着对他的起诉状的时候，这位自傲的狂人尽量把自己描写为“先知的工具”。有一次，“日本时报”所发表的一篇文章里说到日本人民不应当像对待上帝那样对待麦克阿瑟，这位将军就气得下令把报纸全部烧掉。亚洲人民称为“日本的白脸天皇”的麦克阿瑟，不是“命运的工具”，而是美国银行家的工具，这一事实这才更大白于世界了。
    麦克阿瑟早就依靠着他所具有的野蛮的残暴、对人民的毒恨、功利主义、伪善和对利润的贪婪等等特性，获得美国主子的青睐。华尔街认为他是最伟大的亚洲专家：早在几乎半世纪以前，他就亲手杀死了第一个“亚洲人”！这件事情发生在本世纪初，当美国帝国主义者们残酷地屠杀争取祖国独立的菲律宾人民的时候。那一次屠杀，是麦克阿瑟的父亲——阿尔杜尔·麦克阿瑟将军所领导的。
    一位美国历史学家写道：“我们的兵没有捉住过俘虏，没有进行过任何登记，他们只不过在全国各地飞快地跑了一转，假如他们在路上碰到一个成年的菲律宾人，他们就会杀死他”。
    麦克阿瑟少尉也跑遍了全国。他遇见第一个已经倒下去的菲律宾青年，便向他连发了所有的六颗子弹。后来，麦克阿瑟对自己的同乡百万富翁克罗莫维里说：“这些人能够忍受多少颗子弹？我对这问题，获得了一种新观念。我把他的背翻过来，我把手放在他的胸头，我摸得到所有的六颗子弹。它们一个连一个地紧紧排在一起。”
    麦克阿瑟顺利地擢升了。他曾做过“最年轻的团长”，后来成为美军中“最年轻的师团司令”。但这在他是不能感到满足的。他想成为最年轻的将军。一九二二年，麦克阿瑟娶了一个继承了大宗财产的女人——最大的摩根银行的亲信之一，百万富翁斯托茨别里的继女。过了不久，麦克阿瑟的岳父用拳头敲着桌子，向另一个银行家——当时美国陆军部长维克斯，力争把麦克阿瑟擢升为少将。又经过了几年，到一九三○年，依照摩根的劝告麦克阿瑟便被提升为陆军参谋部长了。
    被美国工人称为“摩根的将军”的他在新职位上，把自己表现得非常“荣誉”。一九三二年，他进行了第一次独出心裁的“军事行动”。
    ……“敌人”进攻了首都。数千失业者——第一次世界大战的退伍士兵们——带着衣服褴褛的饥饿的妻儿来到白宫要求发给早经允许的补助金。英勇的麦克阿瑟没有惊慌失措！他指挥着第十二步兵团的一个营、第三骑兵团的一个骑兵中队、一个坦克排和第十六旅的参谋连向那群没有武器的人们攻击。麦克阿瑟当时报告说：“尽管敌人占有平均五个或六个对一个的多数，可是暴徒们在无可抗御的我们的力量之前战栗了。当时在场的人力充沛的军队、很好的技术装备，严格的纪律和一致的行动，使我们对任何人群的攻击都获得胜利的保证。”
    麦克阿瑟的全部本领，所有他的“军事天才”，他的全部“政治哲学”都在这个“胜利”之中。这里也有着他对人民——老百姓——的特殊的憎恨和在一切有组织的群众行动之前的恐怖（他相信：“老百姓充满了革命精神，会危害到国家基础”）。这里也有着兽性的惨忍和信赖武力“绝对优越”的习惯。当时这位将军固有的摆架子和吹牛的习性也表现出来。麦克阿瑟为了要穿上一套称身的制服，并在胸前挂满徽章，曾把那次“会战”延迟了一小时。在他的生涯的以后阶段，他是花费了不少时间，研究过自己的金边军帽的式样、异样的绣金制服和口袋上绣着“麦克阿瑟”字样的短大衣的。
    麦克阿瑟把自己屠杀失业者的经验总结成一种特殊的军事条规。把他的一些解决罢工的“科学的”方法介绍一下罢。方法上最重要的规律就是“逞意残杀”。有一个美国退伍军人回忆说：夏威夷于一九三三年按照麦克阿瑟的命令，进行了几次演习。每一个部队分成了两组：一组穿着旧军服扮作赤手空拳的“罢工者”，另一组武装着枪支——将军们的“合法的和有秩序的军队”。军队用刺刀来杀“罢工者”，对方面没有权利反抗，非逃跑不可。
    一九二九年——一九三三年的经济危机震撼了美国，引起了工人运动的空前高涨。当时华尔街的老板们想一想：谁是能够制裁“老百姓”的“有力人物”呢？当然想到了麦克阿瑟。粉碎过饥饿的失业军的“英雄”，这一来企图在另一功业——华盛顿的法西斯队伍的领导上显一显身手，这目的是要推翻罗斯福政府，而建立麦克阿瑟政府来接替。摩根的银行、钢铁托辣斯、美孚石油公司、通用汽车公司及其他美国的无冕帝王们，全都支持这个经过考验的立功的候补者。可是在国内建立法西斯独裁的企图，在最后的瞬间失败了——阴谋参加者之一泄露了秘密，人民群众便把那些反动计划撕碎了。
    这位失败了的美国“元首”被调派到菲律宾去。摩根家族对菲律宾的兴趣是像对投资的土地一样，愈来愈强的。菲律宾军队的统帅就是杜格拉斯·麦克阿瑟。他对委托他来管的岛屿并不很关心。他却一心一意忙于巩固私人财产的事情。这位统帅显得是一个出色的投机家。他变成了菲律宾两个最大的资本家——梭利亚诺和爱里沙里杰——的伙计，他买进了亚科海铬矿的股票、安太马克金矿及其他许多矿业公司的股票。他又获得了广大的地产，最后，他耽溺于制造啤酒、经营饭馆之类与金色上将肩章如此不调和的一些事业。
    在美日战争期间，麦克阿瑟所受到的最大打击不是带给他耻辱的一场败仗，倒是落到日本人手里去的他的企业的损失。战后，他为了自己，为了自己的啤酒厂伙计们，要求过不多不少正好四百六十九万五千七百零八美元的“军事损失补偿费”。这个数目的几乎一半，麦克阿瑟已经到手了。菲律宾的金沙、矿山、工厂和农场又给麦克阿瑟及其他“独立的菲律宾”的主人们不断地带来了红利。
    麦克阿瑟从马尼拉被调派到东京去——“菲律宾化”日本。他首先从事于自己的私人事业：购买最大的轮船公司“日本邮船会社”的股票，开办厚利的百货商店，侵吞那些能够到手的最贵重的艺术品等等。他对摩根家族，及华尔街王朝的较小的代表们的效劳是难以估价的。他利用美国实际统治者的地位，为美国垄断资本创造了真正空前的掠夺日本经济的可能性。
    麦克阿瑟的伪善的程度也毫不逊于今日美国其他高等活动家。他完全像杜鲁门一样，“为了听众”发表冗长的废话，几乎每次都是由“自由”、“民主”、“理想”、“上帝”、“进步”、“文明”这些字眼所构成的。但是这伪君子将军转瞬间却就露出了——实际上他原正是——强盗将军的原形。麦克阿瑟很注意日本民主人士，不久以前他解释着说道：“对待这些人的唯一方法，就是把他们的鼻子打出血来”。
    在由麦克阿瑟“民主化了的”日本，一千二百种以上的进步报纸被封闭了。受过训练的数千个美国侦探日日夜夜搜寻着共产党的领袖。军事法庭每天都宣判一些日本爱国者苦役的徒刑。正如官方公报中不久前所报道，日本共产党中央委员春日正一被警察逮捕，受了“轻微的拷讯”。
    麦克阿瑟破坏着和平工业，庇护着大炮资本家。他一心想恢复日本武士道的军队。细菌战的“理论家”和实践家正受着麦克阿瑟慈父般的抚育。天生小家气的麦克阿瑟把所有这些都称为自己“最伟大的、而且可能也是最珍贵的成就”。
    在麦克阿瑟所干的罪恶滔天的战犯事业中，现在添上了最黑暗的一章：朝鲜。这位麦克阿瑟——美国帝国主义在远东的总督——靠美国的独占资本来实现对南朝鲜殖民地化的最高领导。这位将军在南朝鲜的投机行为，正如同在日本及菲律宾一样。他首先“博得一位本国人的高兴”：摩根银行在朝鲜尝得了一些最合胃口的美味——从前为日本“东方拓植”公司所占有的矿山、土地和拥有十二亿五千万美元这么巨额资本的一些银行。
    麦克阿瑟准备好叫李承晚傀儡向北朝鲜的进攻的一切，给他发出了侵略信号，接着他便成为各种毛皮的干涉者们所凑成的强盗军队的司令了。他吃了不少败仗，因此，在破坏和平的城市和乡村，枪杀各色人们的时候，他的狠毒和野蛮是特别突出的。
    曾在麦克阿瑟手下服务过的任何士兵和水手都知道，这个手脚灵活的官场人物不论何时何地，都没有一次真正战胜过兵力和他相等的敌人。第二次大战的退伍军人，一个纯朴的美国人陶姆逊很恰当地说到麦克阿瑟：“华尔街亲法西斯的帝国主义者捏造了一种关于麦克阿瑟军事天才的传说，因为他们需要一个白马的骑士来领导他们奴役亚洲和菲洲的各种有色人民的进军”。
    日本的谚语说道：“狼到了要断最后一口气，还尽想着吞吃小羊。”卑鄙的帝国主义野兽麦克阿瑟是拚着作僵尸的。全世界每个角落里都又轻蔑又痛恨地谈着这个七十岁的吸血鬼麦克阿瑟的名字。但是亚洲人民对于麦克阿瑟却还要开特殊的账单。
    “东方的智慧只尊敬主人的鞭子”这一句下贱的话是出于他——麦克阿瑟——的狗嘴的。他的东京参谋部已变成战争贩子的巢窟，正在编纂着反对爱自由的人民的卑劣阴谋。
    不是别人，就是麦克阿瑟自己泄露出自己的掠夺计划——美国帝国主义的计划。这个刽子手将军在八月底发给芝加哥“海外退伍军人”协会的信中，把太平洋称为“美国湖”。麦克阿瑟宣称，美国要攫取中国的台湾并把它变成“不沉的航空母舰”。他一味胡想着日后有一天美国可以统治从“海参崴到新加坡”一切亚洲的海港。
    如所周知，杜鲁门先生看到他的将军太过坦白，有些害怕了，便禁止各报发表他的信。过了一个半月，杜鲁门亲自跑到离美国海岸一万公里的威克岛，去慰问麦克阿瑟。麦克阿瑟的纲领虽不适于报上刊载，但也完全吻合于美国帝国主义者的意图。
    作着苏联人民切齿的深仇的麦克阿瑟公开地号召“先发制人”的反苏战争。
    向华尔街领钱的时事宣传人员常常把麦克阿瑟称为“美国民族的象征”。事实全不如此。美国纯朴的人们都很知道麦克阿瑟的真正价值。当一九四八年华尔街法西斯团体推荐他为美国总统候选人时，人民极其坚决明确地说出自己的“不”。麦克阿瑟在威斯康辛州的首次选举就落第了；他的拥护者们想在加里弗尼亚州设法使他的名字列入候选人名单，可是他们甚至在那“请求书”上，也还征集不到足够的签名人数。
    麦克阿瑟有一个先驱者——历史上的一个类似人物。但这不是拿破仑，那东京的凶手是不能和拿破仑相比的。这是另一个法国人——巴黎公社的血腥的刽子手喀里斐将军。他娶了一个富有的银行家的女儿，才获得社会上的地位，这是与麦克阿瑟相似的；他因亲自屠杀“暴动者”这一种突出的残忍性而使富人政府注意到自己，这也和麦克阿瑟相似。他沉浸在巴黎公社的血泊中，因而在军队与军事行政方面获得了高的地位。他又在多次殖民地战争中发了财。这几点也和麦克阿瑟都是相似的。
    马克思在想到巴黎公社的强盗们的时候写道，历史将把他们钉在“那个耻辱的路标上，他们的僧侣们的一切祈祷都不能从这路标上把他们解救下来”。今日的自由与民主的绞杀者——美国帝国主义者们和他们的警犬——血腥的战争贩子麦克阿瑟是要受到人类更严厉的判决的。
