Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions
    Organizes Large-Scale Current Affairs Propaganda
    To Improve Workers' Awareness and Launch Production Competitions

    [Our Newspaper] (Workers' Daily) According to reports: The Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions organized a large-scale current affairs propaganda campaign. Through this education, the broad masses of workers further recognized the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to expand its war of aggression, and enthusiastically strengthened the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend our homes and country with practical actions to launch production competitions.

    The large-scale current affairs propaganda began on October 19th. Forty-one responsible cadres from units such as the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CCP, the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, the Propaganda Department of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the CCP, and the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions participated in this work. At the beginning of the work, they systematically went to various factories and workers' families to widely carry out current affairs propaganda, and put forward the specific work that the workers in Shenyang should do under the current situation. During the propaganda work, the people who attended the lectures were very enthusiastic and rushed to the locations designated by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions on time. Workers in Sujiatun even drove a train to pick up lecturers to give lectures. According to preliminary statistics, as of October 31st, a total of 65 oral reports were made, with more than 66,100 listeners (excluding family members and self-reports from various factories). In addition to this, the industrial unions and factories in Shenyang all made reports on the current situation and tasks by the factory directors, party branch secretaries, and union chairmen, based on their specific circumstances; and used blackboards, broadcasts, speech contests, seminars, clippings, and various artistic forms to repeatedly carry out propaganda and education for the workers.

    After this current affairs propaganda, the general workers had a preliminary understanding of the current situation and launched a patriotic production competition. Before listening to the current affairs report, some workers neither questioned nor reported enemy rumors to the organization; after listening to the current affairs report, they became highly vigilant, investigated where the rumors came from, and assisted the government in arresting counter-revolutionaries. For example, after listening to the current affairs report, the workers of the Northeast Kiln General Factory found the special agent who wrote the counter-revolutionary slogans and sent them to the security section. Some factories also held anti-rumor conferences. Some workers were not clear about the strength of the people's democratic camp and the strength of the aggressive camp. After listening to the current affairs report, they realized that the strength of the people's democratic camp was unprecedentedly strong, and U.S. imperialism was truly a paper tiger, and they were full of confidence in the victory of the just struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend our homes and country. Some workers did not have enough understanding of U.S. imperialism. After listening to the current affairs report, they realized that U.S. imperialism was even more brutal than Japanese imperialism in Korea. At the same time, the workers also realized that U.S. imperialism's invasion of Korea was a preparation to invade China, and our assistance to Korea was to defend our own country. Therefore, after studying current affairs, the workers of the Machine Factory No. 3, under the leadership of labor models Zhao Guoyou and Nie Bingju, launched a patriotic production competition and challenged all the workers in Northeast China to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend our homes and country with practical actions. Now, the workers in Shenyang and the entire Northeast China are responding to the challenge of Zhao Guoyou's workshop, and the patriotic competition has become a widespread mass movement.

    The reasons why this current affairs propaganda was more successful than in the past are: First, the leadership was unified, the forces were concentrated, especially the responsible comrades went to give lectures themselves, and many workers said that they could solve problems. In the factory, most of the activists were organized into propaganda teams, or the propagandists were organized, and under the unified leadership of the Party, government, and trade union, they were first given current affairs reports, and then they were sent to the workers and their families for propaganda, which was very effective. Second, positive propaganda was carried out, exposing the conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to invade Korea and China from the positive side, using concrete figures and facts to show that the strength of the world peace and democracy camp was greater than the strength of the aggressive group, and at the same time pointing out the difficulties and the prospects for its failure in the war of aggression, which enhanced the people's confidence in victory. Third, the situation was combined with the task, the propaganda was combined with the action, and after the general current affairs propaganda, it turned to the patriotic production competition and mass air defense and anti-rumor work to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and the slogan of "Machines are weapons, factories are battlefields" was put forward to resist U.S. imperialism's aggression and support the Korean people's liberation war by producing more products and improving quality. Fourth, extensive family propaganda and organization work was carried out. When the family members had an understanding of the situation, they would not hold back the men, and the men could concentrate on production. However, in some places, this current affairs propaganda did not target the different ideological conditions of the workers, and in terms of methods, there were more oral reports and fewer organized discussions.

    Based on these circumstances, the Cultural and Educational Department of the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, in its preliminary summary of this work, especially emphasized that future current affairs propaganda should be combined with the patriotic production competition to carry out regular current affairs propaganda and education. It is also necessary to establish and improve the organization of propagandists, and to provide regular education for propagandists to solve their difficulties. Propagandists should not only carry out propaganda to the masses, but also regularly collect the ideological conditions of the masses and give them solutions. Only in this way can the consciousness of the working class be raised and the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to defend our homes and country be strengthened.

### 沈阳市总工会  组织大规模时事宣传  提高职工认识开展生产竞赛

　　沈阳市总工会
    组织大规模时事宣传
    提高职工认识开展生产竞赛
    【本报讯】据工人日报消息：沈阳市总工会曾组织了大规模的时事宣传工作。经过这一教育，广大职工进一步认清了美帝国主义扩大侵略战争的阴谋，并热烈地以开展生产竞赛的实际行动来加强抗美援朝保家卫国的斗争。
    大规模的时事宣传从十月十九日开始。参加这次工作的有中共东北局宣传部、东北总工会、中共沈阳市委宣传部和沈阳市总工会等单位负责干部四十一人。工作开始，即有计划地分别到各工厂及职工家属中广泛进行时事宣传，并提出在目前形势下沈阳的工人们应该做那些具体工作。在宣传工作进行中，参加听讲的人非常踊跃，都争先恐后地按时到市总工会规定的地点。苏家屯的工人曾开火车来接讲师去讲。据初步统计，到十月三十一日止，共作了口头报告六十五次，听众六万六千一百余人（家属和各厂自行报告的不在内）。除此以外，沈阳市各产业工会、各工厂都根据自己的具体情况，由厂长、党的总支书记、工会主席作了目前形势与任务的报告；并利用黑板报、广播、讲演比赛会、座谈会、剪报以及各种艺术形式，反复向职工进行宣传教育。
    经过这次时事宣传，一般职工对目前形势都有了初步的认识，并展开了爱国主义生产大竞赛。一部分工人在未听时事报告前，对敌特造谣，既不追问，也不向组织报告；听了时事报告后，便引起了高度的警惕，追究谣言是从那里来的，协助政府逮捕反革命分子。如东北窑业总厂的工人，听了时事报告后，曾把写反革命标语的特务分子找出来送到保卫科去。有的工厂还召开了反谣大会。有些工人对人民民主阵营的力量和侵略阵营的力量弄不清楚，听了时事报告后，才知道了人民民主阵营的力量是空前强大，美帝国主义真正是一个纸老虎，对抗美援朝保家卫国的正义斗争，充满了胜利的信心。还有些职工对美帝国主义认识不足，听了时事报告后，知道了美帝国主义在朝鲜比日本帝国主义还要残暴。同时，职工们也认识了美帝国主义侵略朝鲜，是准备侵略中国，我们援助朝鲜就是保卫自己的祖国。因此机器三厂的工人学习时事后，便在劳动模范赵国有和聂秉举的领导下，发动了爱国主义生产竞赛，并向全东北工人挑战，以实际行动来抗美援朝保家卫国。现在沈阳和全东北的职工都纷纷响应赵国有车间的挑战，爱国主义竞赛成为广泛的群众运动了。
    这次时事宣传比较过去有成绩的原因是：第一、领导统一，力量集中，尤其是负责同志亲自去讲，许多工人都说能解决问题。在工厂里面多数是把积极分子组成宣传队，或把宣传鼓动员组织起来，在党、政、工统一的领导下，先给他们做时事报告，然后再由他们到职工群众及其家属中进行宣传，收效很大。第二、进行正面的宣传，从正面来揭露美帝国主义侵略朝鲜和中国的阴谋，用具体的数字和事实来说明世界和平民主阵营的力量大过于侵略集团的力量，同时指出美帝国主义在侵略战争中的困难和它失败的前途，提高了人民胜利的信心。第三、形势和任务结合，宣传和行动结合，经过一般的时事宣传后，接着就转入抗美援朝的爱国主义生产竞赛和群众性的防空反谣等工作，提出“机器就是武器，工厂就是战场”的口号，以多出产品，提高质量来反抗美帝国主义的侵略，和支援朝鲜人民的解放战争。第四、广泛的进行了家属宣传组织工作，家属对形势有了认识，才不扯男人的腿，男人才能一心一意的搞生产。但是，这次时事宣传有的地方还没有针对职工们的不同思想情况进行宣传，在方式上也是口头报告多，组织讨论少。
    根据这些情况，沈阳市总工会文教部在初步总结这一工作时，对今后时事宣传特别强调要结合爱国主义生产竞赛，进行经常性的时事宣传教育。并要建立和健全宣传员的组织，对宣传员要有经常的教育，解决他们的疑难。宣传员不但向群众进行宣传，还要经常搜集群众的思想情况，给以解决。只有这样才能提高工人阶级的觉悟，加强抗美援朝保家卫国的运动。
