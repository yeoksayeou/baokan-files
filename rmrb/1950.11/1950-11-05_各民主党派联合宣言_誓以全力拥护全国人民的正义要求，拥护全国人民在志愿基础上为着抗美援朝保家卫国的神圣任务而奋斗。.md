　　Joint Declaration of Democratic Parties

    Vowing to Fully Support the Just Demands of the People Nationwide and Support the Sacred Task of Resisting America, Aiding Korea, Protecting Our Homes and Defending the Nation on a Voluntary Basis.

    The actions of the imperialists, led by the United States, in invading Korea are seriously threatening China's security. The people of China have long focused their attention on the actions of the American aggressors in Korea and their actions in China's territory, airspace, and territorial waters.

    The imperialists' ambitions for aggression are endless. The U.S. imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea on June 25 this year. Their conspiracy is definitely not limited to destroying the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. They want to annex Korea, they want to invade China, they want to rule Asia, and they want to conquer the world.

    The facts of the past four months have fully proven this point. After the United States instigated the Korean puppet Syngman Rhee to launch an attack on the Korean people, U.S. President Truman immediately ordered the U.S. Navy, Army, and Air Force to wage war in Korea. At the same time, he ordered the U.S. Seventh Fleet to invade China's Taiwan territorial waters, forcibly interfering in our liberation of Taiwan. At the same time, he ordered the strengthening of aggression against Vietnam, the Philippines, and other places. These facts prove that the purpose of the U.S. imperialists in launching the war of aggression against Korea is to invade China and invade the whole of Asia.

    Since the U.S. imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea in June, their invading air force has repeatedly invaded China's northeastern airspace, massacring our people and destroying our property. Its invading navy has even shelled our merchant ships in international waters, undermining our navigation rights. Most recently, the hideous faces of the U.S. imperialists have become even more exposed. After the U.S. imperialists and their accomplices forcibly occupied Seoul, they stubbornly disregarded our warnings, crossed the Korean 38th parallel, and advanced fiercely with a large number of troops towards the Yalu and Tumen Rivers, directly threatening China's northeastern border.

    Today's situation is already very clear. The U.S. imperialists are repeating the old trick of the Japanese invaders, who first invaded Korea and then invaded China. Everyone knows that Korea is a relatively small country, but its strategic position is extremely important. The purpose of the U.S. imperialists in invading Korea is not mainly for Korea itself, but to invade China, just as the Japanese imperialists did in the past. Historical facts have long told us that the survival of Korea is closely related to the safety of China. If the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold; if the door is broken, the hall will be in danger. The Chinese people's support for the Korean people's war of resistance against the U.S. is not only a moral responsibility, but also closely related to the vital interests of all our people, and is determined by the necessity of self-defense. Saving one's neighbor is saving oneself, and defending the motherland requires supporting the Korean people.

    The people across the country have now widely and enthusiastically demanded to fight for the sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending the nation through voluntary action. This demand is completely reasonable and completely just. As Premier Zhou Enlai said: "The Chinese people will never tolerate foreign aggression, nor can they allow the imperialists to肆行invade their neighbors and ignore them." These two sentences represent the 475 million people of China. It reflects the will of the people and embodies the demands of the people. The firm will of the entire Chinese people, united as one, to defend their homes, defend their motherland, and defend peace, cannot be destroyed in any way.

    The Chinese people cherish peace. We have always wanted peace in the past, and we will always want peace in the future. We want peace for China, we want peace for Asia, and we want lasting peace for the whole world and all mankind. We advocate that the Korean issue should be resolved peacefully, and the imperialist aggressor troops should withdraw from Korea. However, the U.S. imperialists and their accomplices are not only unwilling to withdraw their invading troops, stop the war of aggression, and resolve the Korean issue peacefully, but are instead madly developing this war of aggression northward towards the 38th parallel and towards China's border, the Yalu and Tumen Rivers. This forces us to recognize the fact that if the peace-loving people of the world want to achieve peace, they must take active action to resist violence and stop aggression. Only by resistance is it possible for the imperialists to learn a lesson, and only then is it possible to fairly resolve the issues of independence and liberation in Korea and other regions according to the will of the people. Justice is on our side, on the side of the people of China, Korea, Vietnam, and the Philippines, on the side of the people of all Asia, and on the side of the peace-loving people of the world. The imperialist aggressors are violating justice, losing sympathy, and isolating themselves. The aggressors are bound to move towards final failure, and final victory will surely belong to the just people.

    The democratic parties of China vow to fully support the just demands of the people nationwide and support the sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending the nation on a voluntary basis.

### 各民主党派联合宣言  誓以全力拥护全国人民的正义要求，拥护全国人民在志愿基础上为着抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务而奋斗。

　　各民主党派联合宣言
    誓以全力拥护全国人民的正义要求，拥护全国人民在志愿基础上为着抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务而奋斗。
    以美国为首的帝国主义者侵略朝鲜的行动正在严重地威胁着中国的安全。全中国人民早已集中注视美国侵略者在朝鲜的行动以及在中国领土领空领海上的行动。
    帝国主义者的侵略野心是无止境的。美帝国主义者在今年六月二十五日发动侵朝战争，他们的阴谋绝对不止于摧毁朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，他们要并吞朝鲜，他们要侵略中国，他们要统治亚洲，他们要征服全世界。
    四个月来的事实，已经充分地证明了这一点。在美国指使朝鲜傀儡李承晚发动向朝鲜人民的进攻以后，美国总统杜鲁门随即命令美国海陆空军到朝鲜进行战争，他同时命令美国第七舰队侵入我国台湾领海，武力干涉我国解放台湾；他同时命令增强对越南、菲律宾等地的侵略。这些事实，证明了美帝国主义发动侵朝战争的目的是要侵略中国，侵略整个亚洲。
    从美帝国主义者在六月发动侵朝战争以后，其侵朝空军曾多次侵入我国东北的领空，屠杀我国的人民，炸毁我国的财产。其侵朝海军竟在公海之内炮击我国的商船，破坏我国的航权。到了最近，美帝国主义者的狰狞面目更加暴露出来了。美帝国主义者及其帮凶们的武力侵占汉城以后，一意孤行，不顾我国的警告，侵越朝鲜“三八”线，并以大量陆军向鸭绿江、图们江汹涌逼进，直接威胁我国东北国境。
    今天的情势已经十分明显了。美帝国主义者正袭用着当年日寇先侵略朝鲜随后侵略中国的故技。谁也知道，朝鲜是一个较小的国家，但其战略地位则极重要。美帝国主义者侵略朝鲜的目的，主要地不是为了朝鲜本身，而是为了要侵略中国，如像日本帝国主义者过去所做过的那样。历史的事实早已告诉我们，朝鲜的存亡与中国的安危是密切关联的。唇亡则齿寒，户破则堂危。中国人民支援朝鲜人民的抗美战争不止是道义上的责任，而且和我国全体人民的切身利害密切地关联着，是为自卫的必要性所决定的。救邻即是自救，保卫祖国必须支援朝鲜人民。
    全国人民现已广泛地热烈地要求用志愿的行动为着抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务而奋斗。这种要求是完全合理的，完全合乎正义的。诚如周恩来总理所说：“中国人民决不能容忍外国的侵略，也不能听任帝国主义者对自己的邻人肆行侵略而置之不理。”这两句话是代表中国四万七千五百万人民说的，它反映了人民的意志，体现了人民的要求。中国全体人民团结一致，保卫家乡，保卫祖国，保卫和平的坚强意志，是无论如何也不能摧毁的。
    中国人民是酷爱和平的。我们以前一向要和平，我们今后永远要和平。我们要中国的和平，我们要亚洲的和平，我们要全世界全人类的持久和平。我们主张朝鲜问题应当以和平方式来解决，帝国主义者的侵略军应当从朝鲜撤回去。然而美帝国主义者及其帮凶们不但不愿意撤退侵略军，停止侵略战争与以和平方式解决朝鲜问题，反而向“三八”线以北，向中国的边境鸭绿江、图们江疯狂地发展这种侵略战争。这样就迫使我们认识了这样一个事实，那就是：世界上爱好和平的人民如果想要得到和平，就必须用积极行动来抵抗暴行，制止侵略。只有抵抗，才有可能使帝国主义者获得教训，才有可能按照人民的意志公正地解决朝鲜及其他地区的独立和解放的问题。正义是在我们方面，是在中国、朝鲜、越南、菲律宾的人民方面，是在全亚洲的人民方面，是在全世界爱好和平的人民方面。帝国主义侵略者是违反正义的，是丧失同情的，是自陷于孤立的。侵略者必定要走向最后失败，而最后胜利必归于正义的人民。
    中国各民主党派誓以全力拥护全国人民的正义要求，拥护全国人民在志愿基础上为着抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务而奋斗。
