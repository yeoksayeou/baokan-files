　　Propaganda Workers Should Pay Attention to Reporting New Materials
    To the Editor:
    The current movement to resist America and aid Korea is unfolding universally. I would like to remind everyone to pay attention to the fact that propaganda must be closely linked to the development of the current situation and must be good at using the news and editorials published in the daily newspapers.
    Because facts are the best way to educate the masses, and the development of the situation increasingly and vividly proves the imperialist conspiracy of aggression, which is hateful to the bone.
    I have seen some factories and schools, when carrying out propaganda, focus on explaining the facts of American imperialism's aggression against China in history, and organize workers to denounce the oppression of imperialism against us in the past. This is of course the correct method, but if the current situation is not explained to the masses at the same time, the power of propaganda will be weakened.
    For example, today's newspaper reports the opening of the World Peace Congress and the news that U.S. aircraft invaded our territory twenty-eight times in one hundred hours, bombing and strafing, which is good material for propaganda to the masses.
    However, I have seen some comrades who are engaged in propaganda work have not paid attention to how to use this news. Instead, they say: "Ha! I've been too busy doing propaganda on the streets these days, and I haven't even read the newspaper properly, only the headlines."
    I think this situation is obviously wrong and I hope it will be corrected immediately.
    Reader Yang Chaochu
    Editor's Note: Comrade Yang Chaochu's suggestion is correct. I hope that comrades who are currently engaged in the propaganda work of resisting America and aiding Korea will pay attention to it.

### 宣传工作者应注意报上新的材料

　　宣传工作者应注意报上新的材料
    编辑同志：
    当前抗美援朝的宣传运动正普遍展开，我想提醒大家注意，宣传必须密切地和目前形势的发展结合，必须善于运用每日报纸上登载的消息和社论。
    因为事实最足以教育群众，形势的发展日愈鲜明地证实了帝国主义的侵略阴谋，这是令人切齿痛恨的。
    尝见有的工厂及学校在进行宣传时，着重从历史上说明美帝侵华的事实，组织工人控诉帝国主义过去对我们的压迫，这当然是正确的方法，但是若不同时向群众说明目前形势，就会减弱宣传的力量。
    例如今天报载世界和大开幕及美机在一百小时内侵犯我境轰炸、扫射达二十八次的消息，便是很好向群众宣传的材料。
    但是我见到有些正在进行宣传工作的同志，还没有注意如何运用这些消息，反而说：“哈！这几天我上街宣传太忙了，连报也没有好好看，只看了大标题。”
    我认为，这种情形显然是不对的，希望立刻加以纠正。
    读者  杨朝俶
    编者按：杨朝俶同志这个建议是对的，希望现在正在进行抗美援朝宣传工作的同志们加以注意。
