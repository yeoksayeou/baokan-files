Since returning from the National Congress of Labor, Peasants, and Soldiers' Model Heroes, Zhang Zifu, a labor hero from the Fushun Coal Mine, has delivered 30 formal reports in meetings as of October 23rd, within twelve days. The most conservative estimate is that each time, at least 500 people attended. Moreover, the number of listeners only increased, with no one "slipping away" midway.

He spoke everywhere about his conversation with Chairman Mao in Beijing: "I said, 'When we came, all the workers and staff of Fushun gave us a task, asking us to greet Chairman and Commander-in-Chief and wish them good health.' Chairman Mao said, 'We are all in good health; how is your life?' Chairman Mao didn't forget the lives of us workers for a moment!" At this point, his expression became very serious, making the audience feel that "Chairman Mao is asking about us." But when he turned the topic to Chairman Mao raising his glass at the banquet to "wish all the working people of the country good health and continued progress," the mood of the masses was again inspired by him, as if they were about to "continue progress" immediately.

Describing the welcome he received when he first arrived in Beijing, Zhang Zifu said: "It started snowing as soon as we got off the train." The crowd naturally paused slightly. Could it snow in the capital in September? But he immediately continued: "It turned out to be confetti thrown on us by the welcoming crowd. My hat became colorful too."

When explaining the situation of the US imperialists launching a war of aggression, he said: "It's like a mad dog, with its body lying in the Americas, its two hind legs stepping on Europe, and its two front paws reaching into Asia – can it stand like this for long?" At this point, he gave the audience a little time to imagine. When he saw many people nodding, he continued: "If this paw extended to South Korea stands still honestly, it can live a little longer; now that this paw is extended to North Korea, and it scratches people with its nails, it doesn't matter. The Korean people will cut off its toes one by one, and finally cut off this leg..." His original words certainly didn't end there, but rather used such metaphors to further explain the US imperialists' frenzied aggression and scattered forces.

When explaining the situation of the Korean War, Zhang Zifu sometimes didn't state the theme first, but rather told a story: "I thought of a joke – in my hometown, an old man carried two braids of garlic to the market to sell. Two young men joked with him from behind. Old Zhang went up and took off a braid, immediately removing half the weight. The old man would naturally feel it, and Old Zhang failed. Old Li didn't do it that way. He followed the old man lightly, grabbed the garlic, and plucked it off one by one. Sure enough, the old man didn't realize it until almost the entire braid of garlic was plucked off." Once the story was told, he led to the main topic: "Of course, this analogy may not be entirely appropriate. Now the Korean People's Army is not fighting a head-on battle with the United States. Over a long period of time, it eliminates one group of you here and another group there, and slowly finishes off the US imperialist army."

In addition, he often used contrasting statements to make the positive aspects very clear. For example, in order to illustrate that the Chinese working class had truly become masters of their own destiny, he first described how they were oppressed and enslaved in the past, creating a very prominent contrast between the past and the present. To illustrate the simple and honest style of the leaders of the Central People's Government, he first talked about visiting the Forbidden City, using the historical facts of the luxurious and extravagant lives of emperors of past dynasties to highlight the current honesty and public service.

When talking about the revolutionary struggles of the American working class, Zhang Zifu said that he met the American representatives of the World Youth Delegation in Beijing. "The American worker brothers are just like us in the puppet Manchukuo era, suffering from the oppression of big bellies, so they also carried out big strikes and passive resistance. 'Go slow, relax, shit and piss at three o'clock, pull up your pants and get off work.' Didn't we used to go slow like that?"

He not only readily used past idioms, but also, when describing the greed and insatiability of the US imperialists, could make up a set at any time: "Now the big American devils have one foot in two boats, wanting to go to Hebei and wanting to go to Jiangnan. Warships to Taiwan, troops to fight in Korea, holding Chiang Kai-shek in both hands, still thinking about Syngman Rhee in their hearts. A rabbit's tail can't be long, and it's over when it falls into the river!"

Although Zhang Zifu's speeches didn't come with an outline, every issue was very organized. The usual method was to tell stories and use metaphors around the theme first, then return to the theme and express opinions on the front, which was considered the climax of this issue. Because it was a frontal expression of opinions, the attitude and tone were very solemn. After he described the majestic power of the People's Liberation Army, he stood up straight, only his chest protruding slightly, his head raised, his eyes wide open, and his tone became so strong and powerful. "With such a powerful People's Liberation Army, we have enough strength to defend our motherland. If the US imperialists dare to climb up from the sea, we will not leave one of them behind, and we will resolutely eliminate them!" With full energy and a loud voice, waving his big fists, everyone could feel from him how majestic the power to defend the motherland was.

When he turned the topic to another aspect, it meant that the climax was over, and he started another story, or a very detailed description, gradually leading to another climax. Like waves, the atmosphere of the whole venue was also tense, indignant, relaxed, and joyous at times. The speaker spoke more and more vigorously, and the listeners loved to listen more and more.

Another reason why Zhang Zifu's speeches could attract the masses was that he always paid attention to listening to the reactions of the masses, then analyzed and synthesized them, and gave appropriate answers. The Korean War issue was because his wife heard the neighbors say "The Korean People's Army was defeated," that he collected many examples and explained the Korean situation in detail. When walking, he heard a worker say "Our air force is probably not as good as the United States." So, in his speech, he vividly described the powerful air force he saw in Beijing. Whether in meetings or listening to reports, he always paid attention to the ideological situation of the masses and what ideological concerns the masses had.

Therefore, his speeches were appropriately increased, omitted, or especially emphasized those issues according to various different audiences. To technicians and staff, he said, "Technical theory is like the eyes, and practical operation is like the limbs," in order to illustrate the importance of unity between technicians and workers. When speaking to the families of workers and staff, he focused on publicizing the heroic stories of the mother of soldiers Rong Guanxiu and the female combat hero Guo Junqing. In the workers, the scope of his speech was even broader.

Just like his high working enthusiasm, he is currently tirelessly carrying out propaganda and mobilization. Wherever he goes, there is confidence and vitality. His optimistic spirit immediately infects the masses, and he never bows his head under any difficult conditions. He not only gives formal reports in meeting places, but also in the pit, in the workshop, when walking, or when waiting for the tram, even if there are only two or three people, he will talk endlessly. "Once you meet the workers, the words come, like water from an open mouth, you can't stop it." He then said: "Once the radio station asked me to broadcast, and there was no one in front of me. At this time, I couldn't speak well; I had an hour scheduled, but I finished in half an hour." From this sentence, we can know how rich his emotions are when he speaks.

　　劳模张子富怎样进行宣传鼓动
    方青
    抚顺煤矿的劳动英雄张子富从参加全国工农兵英模代表会议归来后，截至十月二十三日，在十二天中，他在正式会议上的传达报告，就有三十次。最保守的估计，每次也有五百人。而且是听的人越凑越多，从没有人半路上“遛号”。
    他到处讲到在北京和毛主席的谈话：“我说：‘我们来的时候，抚顺全体职工交给我们一个任务，叫我们问候主席和总司令的身体健康。’毛主席说：‘我们身体都很好；你们的生活怎样？’毛主席一时也没有忘记咱们工人的生活呀！”这时他的表情已变得非常严肃，使听众感受到“毛主席在问候我们呢”。但当着他把话题转到在宴会上毛主席举杯“敬祝全国劳动人民身体健康，继续前进”时，群众的情绪又都跟着他振奋起来，就像立刻要“继续前进”似的。
    张子富在描写刚到北京时受欢迎的情形说：“一下车就下开雪了”群众自然稍为一怔，九月的首都能下雪吗？但他马上又接着说：“原来是欢迎的人往我们身上扔的纸屑，我的帽子也变成五彩的了。”
    在他解释美帝发动侵略战争的形势时又说道：“就像一只疯狗一样，身子还卧在美洲，两只后腿踏在欧洲，两只前爪又伸到亚洲，——这个架子，它能站常了吗？”这时他稍微给听众一点想像的时间，看到很多人点头的时候，他才又说下去：“伸到南朝鲜的这只爪子，若是老老实实地站着不动，还能多活一会儿；现在这个爪子又伸到北朝鲜去，它用指甲扎人一下，那不要紧，朝鲜的人民可就要一个一个地把他的脚趾砍掉，最后砍掉他这一只腿……”他的原话绝不是到此为止，而是用这样的比喻，再正面说明美帝的疯狂侵略和兵力分散的情形。
    张子富在讲解朝鲜战争的形势时，有时他并不先把主题标明，而是首先讲故事：“我想起个笑话来——在俺们家乡，有个老头背着两辫蒜到集上去卖。后面两个年青人和他开玩笑，老张上去就拿下一辫来，一下子去了一半分量，老头自然会感觉出来，老张失败了。老李就不这么办，他轻手轻脚地跟着老头，抓住蒜，一颗一颗地往下揪。果然，一辫蒜快要揪完的时候，老头还没有发觉呢。”故事一讲完，就引到正题上来：“当然啦，这个比法不一定恰当。现在朝鲜的人民军，就是不跟美国打硬仗，长期来，这里消灭你一股，那里消灭你一股，慢慢就把美帝国主义的军队收拾完了。”
    此外，他也常常用对比的说法，把正面衬托的很鲜明。譬如：为了说明中国工人阶级真正做了主人，先把过去如何受压迫受奴役描述一番，前后对照，非常突出。为了说明中央人民政府首长的朴素作风，又先讲参观故宫的情形，用历代帝王娇奢淫逸的史实，衬托出现在的廉洁奉公来。
    讲到美国工人阶级的革命斗争时，张子富说，在北京会见了世界青年代表团的美国代表。“美国的工人弟兄和咱们在伪满那时一样，受着大肚皮的压迫，所以他们也实行了大罢工，磨洋工。‘磨洋工，稀吊松，拉屎尿尿三点钟，提着裤子就下了工。’咱们以前不是这么磨过吗？”
    他不仅把过去的成语顺手拈来，当他形容美帝的贪心无厌时，也能随时编一套：“现在的大老美，脚踩两只船，又想上河北，又想下江南。军舰到台湾，出兵打朝鲜，双手捧着个蒋介石，心里还惦记着李承晚。兔子的尾巴长不了，掉到江里完了蛋！”
    张子富讲话虽然不带提纲，但是每个问题都很有条理。通常的办法，是先在主题的周围讲故事，打比喻，然后归到主题上，正面发表议论，算是这一个问题的高潮。因为是正面发表议论，态度和语气就非常庄严。当他叙述了人民解放军的雄伟力量后，身子站的笔直，只是胸膛稍为突出来，仰着头，眼珠子瞪的溜圆，语气也变得那么坚强有力。“我们有这么强大的人民解放军，就有足够的力量保卫我们的祖国，美帝国主义若是敢从海里爬上来，一个也不留，坚决消灭它！”精力又饱满，声音又宏亮，挥舞着两只大拳头，谁都会从他身上体会到保卫祖国的力量是多么雄伟。
    当他把话题转到另一方面时，就是说高潮已过，又开始了另外一个故事，或者是非常细腻的描写，又逐渐引向另一个高潮。像波浪似的，全场气氛也随着一时紧张，一时悲愤，一时轻松，一时欢腾。讲的人越讲越有劲，听的人越听越爱听。
    张子富讲话之所以能够吸引群众的另一个原因，是他随时随地都注意倾听群众的反映，再加以分析综合，作适当的解答。朝鲜战争问题，是他老婆听邻居的反映说：“朝鲜人民军打败了”，他这才搜集了好多例证，详细解释朝鲜形势。走路的时候，他听到一个工人说“咱们的空军恐怕不如美国。”于是他在讲话时就把在北京看到的强大空军有声有色地形容一番。无论在开会时，听汇报时，他随时都很注意群众的思想情况，注意群众有什么思想顾虑。
    因此，他的演词是根据各种不同的对象，适当地增加、取舍，或特别强调那些问题。对技术人员、职员，他说：“技术理论好比眼睛，实际操作好比四肢”，以此说明技术人员与工人团结的重要性。在职工家属中讲话时，就又着重宣传子弟兵的母亲戎冠秀，和女战斗英雄郭俊卿的英雄故事。在工人中，讲话的天地就更辽阔了。
    正和他有着高度的工作热情一样，目前正孜孜不倦地进行着宣传鼓动。他一到哪里，哪里就有了信心，有了生气，他的乐观主义的精神，立刻就感染给群众，决不在任何困难条件下低头。他不仅是在会场上作正式报告，在坑下，在车间，走路时，或者在等电车，即使只有两三个人，他也会滔滔不断地讲起来。“和工友们一见面，话就来了，像开了口子的水一样，堵也堵不住。”他接着又说：“有一次电台上叫我去广播，眼前一个人也没有，这时就讲不好了；规定一个钟头，半点钟就讲完了。”从这句话里，我们可以知道他是用着多么丰富的感情去讲演的。
