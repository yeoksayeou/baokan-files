　　Thinking of Lenin
    ——Commemorating the Thirty-Third Anniversary of the October Revolution
    Lu Ling
    Thinking of Lenin in the dark days of the past. I remember once, in a big city under Kuomintang rule, on the evening of the October Revolution anniversary, we heard that the movie "Lenin in October" was being shown at a certain university, and we went there quietly. It was in a small room behind the auditorium of that university, a room that seemed to have no windows. Less than a hundred people, everyone sat quietly. There was no ceremony, no one spoke, and the movie began. Lenin appeared before us. Suddenly the power went out, and the room was plunged into darkness. But everyone still sat quietly, without even a cough. Several students who had been on guard ran out. Everyone knew that this small gathering could be discovered by secret agent students at any time, who would directly disrupt it or cut the power lines. Everyone waited in the dark. After about half an hour, it was repaired, and the chandelier on the roof lit up. In normal times, this would have been cheered, but now everyone still made no sound. As soon as the lights came on, all the thoughtful faces shone, all with a pious and solemn expression, as if suddenly emerging from some deep place. These faces were so beautiful—indeed, they couldn't be more beautiful. I saw a childish, extremely innocent face. It was the face of a girl who dreamed of life, respected life, and was sincere, but completely did not understand reality. But the impression this face gave at this moment was not entirely like that. This fifteen or sixteen-year-old girl, with one hand on the back of the chair, supporting her chin, her lips pressed tightly, was thinking. You could feel that in that instant, she had lived many years, and was prepared for life, understanding everything. Next to her, an old professor with white hair and wearing an old suit stared motionless ahead. A rather fat old lady put her hands on her knees, closed her eyes...

    "Dad, I know why Lenin made the revolution..." the girl said, her voice very small, but everyone could hear her; she was still thinking, supporting her chin.
    Lenin appeared before us again.
    The copy of the film was quite old, some parts were disjointed, some parts were blurred, but in short, Lenin appeared before us, the sacred crowd of October assaulting the Winter Palace appeared before us. In this city, Chiang Kai-shek's Flying Fortresses howled and sped by like burned and pained beasts, our heroic brothers, even when caught and subjected to torture or even killed in prison, were filled with bright, victorious confidence; and all the laboring people were preparing and expecting, just like the dozens of us in this room. Lenin also appeared before them, and we would have our sacred October of storming the Winter Palace. The movie was over, and we all quietly went out, dispersing into the darkness.

    On the thirty-third anniversary of the October Revolution today, on this day when red flags fly over our Tiananmen Square, on this day when American imperialism dreams of new attacks against us, and the voice of Chairman Mao Zedong resounds throughout the world, this little story is particularly dear to me. In days of struggle and victory, I am always thinking of Lenin. I remember seeing a picture a few months ago of the Korean People's Army liberating a certain town in Korea: heroic soldiers raising flags and weapons and rushing to the high ground, hugging each other; the image of those soldiers raising their hats and carrying thick bullet belts on their bodies, that kind of high-spirited determination, immediately reminded people of the October fighters, the sacred crowd assaulting the Winter Palace. It seems that there is still something in this picture, although not painted, that everyone feels must be there, and that is the great Lenin, leaning forward, stretching out his arms.

    Ancient Asia, Asia bound by thousands of years of feudal shackles, Asia with the pleasure-seeking courts of emperors and the dark prisons of the people, Asia that has been trampled underfoot and soaked in blood by imperialism for hundreds of years, has stood up and turned over. Following the great voice of our Chairman Mao Zedong, the heroic voices of the Korean people, the Vietnamese people, the Indonesian people... have resounded throughout the world. Today, facing the new offensive of imperialism, we are engaged in a great battle. Our battle is the son of the October Revolution. The sacred crowd of October, the great figure of Lenin and Stalin, will forever illuminate every corner of this battle.

　　想着列宁
    ——纪念十月革命三十三周年
    路翎
    在过去的阴暗的日子里，想着列宁。记得有一次，在国民党统治下的一个大城市里，十月革命节的晚上，听说某大学里放映《列宁在十月》的电影，我们悄悄地去了。是在那所大学礼堂后面的一间不大的、好象是连窗户都没有的屋子里，小小的讲台上面的墙壁上挂了一张白布，不到一百个人，大家悄悄地坐着。没有仪式，没有人说话，开始了放映电影。列宁出现在我们面前。突然地电路绝了，屋子里一片漆黑。但大家仍然悄悄地坐着，连咳嗽的声音都没有。几个顶先警戒着的同学跑了出去。大家都知道，这个小集会随时都有可能被特务学生发现，直接捣乱或割断电线的。大家在黑暗中等待着。这样地过了半个钟点的样子，修好了，屋顶上的吊灯亮了。在平常的时候，这是要欢呼的，但现在大家仍然一点声音也没有。电灯一亮，所有的沉思的脸都发光，都有一种虔敬的、庄严的神情，好象是从什么深沉的地方突然浮显了出来似的。这些面孔这样美丽——实在不能再美了。我看见了一张稚气的、天真之极的面孔。那是那种梦想着人生、尊敬生活、心地诚实，但完全不了解现实的姑娘所有的面孔。但此刻这张脸所给予的印象不完全是这样的。这十五六岁的女孩，一只手搭在椅背上，托着腮，嘴唇闭得很紧，思索着。你可以感觉到她在这一刹那间生活了好多年，并且对人生有着准备，一切全都了解。在她的旁边，一个白发的、穿着旧西装的老教授一动不动地凝望着前面。一个身体相当胖的老太太两只手放在膝上，闭着眼睛……。
    “爸爸，我晓得列宁为什么革命了……”女孩说，声音很小，但大家都听得见；她仍然思索着，托着腮。
    列宁又出现在我们面前。
    影片的拷贝相当旧了，有些地方不联贯，有些地方模糊不清，但总之是，列宁出现在我们面前，冲击冬宫的十月的神圣的人群出现在我们面前。在这座城市里面，蒋介石的飞行堡垒象烧痛了的野兽似地啸叫着而奔驰，我们的英勇的兄弟们即使被抓进了监牢忍受着酷刑甚至杀戮，心里也充满了光明的胜利的信心；而全体劳苦的人民在准备着期待着，就象这屋子里我们几十个人一样。列宁也出现在他们面前，我们也会有我们的冲击冬宫的神圣的十月的。电影完了，我们大家悄悄地出去，分散在黑暗中。
    在十月革命三十三周年的今天，在我们的天安门上飞扬着红旗的今天，在美帝国主义梦想着对我们的新的袭击，而毛泽东主席的声音响彻全世界的今天，这段小故事对我特别亲切。在斗争和胜利的日子里，总也是想着列宁。记得前几个月看到过一张朝鲜人民军解放朝鲜某城镇的图片：英勇的战士们高举着旗帜和武器奔上高地，互相拥抱；那高举着帽子，身上背着粗大的子弹带的战士们的形象，那种高扬的坚决的气慨，就令人立刻想到了十月的战士们，冲击冬宫的神圣的人群。好象这图片上还有着一点虽然没有画出来，大家却非感觉到不可的什么，那就是身体倾向前方，伸着手臂的，伟大的列宁。
    古老的亚洲，束缚着几千年的封建锁炼的亚洲，帝王们浮乐的宫庭、人民的黑暗的监牢的亚洲，被帝国主义几百年来踏在脚下、浸在血泊里的亚洲，翻身而且站立起来了。跟随着我们毛泽东主席的伟大的声音，朝鲜人民、越南人民、印尼人民……这些英雄的声音响彻了全世界。今天，面对着帝国主义的新的进攻，我们正在从事着巨大的战斗。我们的战斗是十月革命的儿子。十月的神圣的人群，列宁、斯大林的伟大的姿影，将永远在这战斗的每一个角落里照耀着。
