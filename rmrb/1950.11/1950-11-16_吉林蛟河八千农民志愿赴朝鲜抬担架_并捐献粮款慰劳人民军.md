    And Donate Grain and Money to Console the Korean People's Army
    [This newspaper dispatch] According to the Northeast Daily, after the joint declaration by democratic parties, farmers in Jilin Province have launched a high tide of resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding homes, and defending the country. A large number of farmers have requested to go to Korea to participate in the war. In Jiaohe County alone, as of November 8th, more than 8,300 people volunteered to carry stretchers to support the Korean people's war of resistance against the United States. More than 160 Korean people in the county raised the just demand of returning to their country to join the army and kill the enemy. A 60-year-old Korean woman, Old Lady Jin, resolutely sent her son back to his country to join the war, saying, "Go back and fight the American devils. I can do everything at home and don't need anyone to take care of me." At the same time, the countryside also automatically initiated the work of consoling the Korean People's Army. The Nan Jiujing mutual aid team in Bahu Village, Yongji County, donated 2,000 catties of rice. Minsheng Village in Dunhua County donated more than 4.8 million yuan (Northeast currency) to console the Korean People's Army.
