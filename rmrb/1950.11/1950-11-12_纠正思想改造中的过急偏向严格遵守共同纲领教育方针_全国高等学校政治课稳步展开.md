Correcting the Impatience and Bias in Ideological Remolding, Strictly Adhering to the Common Program's Educational Guidelines

Political Courses Steadily Unfolding in National Universities

[Report from this newspaper] Our reporter Jin Feng reports: This semester, political courses in national universities, after summarizing the experiences of the past year and correcting some of the impatience and bias in ideological remolding, are now strictly adhering to the educational guidelines stipulated in the Common Program, unfolding steadily in various schools in a step-by-step and planned manner.

In the past year, amidst the upsurge of political study by the people of the whole country, most universities have successively established political courses (generally covering the history of social development, New Democracy theory, and political economics). Relatively formal and systematic political and ideological education has been conducted among 130,000 university students, with most students fundamentally breaking away from the influence of the Kuomintang bandit gang's reactionary propaganda, and initially recognizing the Marxist-Leninist worldview and outlook on life. They have also begun to criticize orthodox concepts, narrow nationalism, and intellectual superiority, and initially recognized revolutionary viewpoints such as labor creating the world and class struggle. A progressive atmosphere of serving the people has generally been fostered in universities.

When political and ideological education began in universities last year, due to this work being entirely new, education cadres at all levels lacked experience. In the process of conducting political courses, various schools also exhibited shortcomings such as unclear direction, disregard for steps, simple or even crude methods, and lack of focus in teaching content, as well as dogmatism in teaching methods. Most schools showed a "leftist" leaning, putting forward the general slogan of "using proletarian ideology to remold non-proletarian ideology." In actual implementation, the focus often shifted towards ideas belonging to the bourgeoisie or petty bourgeoisie, such as "individualism," "liberalism," and "purely technical viewpoints," while neglecting that political education should first eliminate the three major enemy ideologies of feudalism, compradorism, and fascism. Secondly, leaders of political courses in some universities lacked sufficient understanding of the long-term nature of ideological remolding, and thus adopted impatient measures that disregarded steps, methods, and the level of awareness of teachers and students. Cadres in some areas mechanically applied the methods of cadre education and Party education in universities without discrimination, and even wrongly used methods such as "chasing," "forcing," "struggle sessions," and "ideological summaries" to solve ideological problems. One university even put forward the inappropriate slogan of "carrying the ideological liberation war to the end." As a result, many students, in order to avoid being attacked, far-fetchedly attributed all past mistakes, large and small, to a "dominant ideological source." However, they did not actually improve their awareness ideologically, but rather increased latent resentment, making further ideological education more difficult.

During the summer vacation, the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government convened a national university political course teaching discussion meeting, which summarized the work of the past year. On the one hand, it affirmed the main achievements, and on the other hand, strictly criticized the aforementioned biases, and clearly and specifically stipulated the future teaching guidelines for political courses in universities: it is necessary to strictly adhere to the Common Program, and first resolutely eliminate the ideologies of feudalism, compradorism, and fascism; secondly, to help the national bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie overcome ideas that violate scientific truth and the interests of the masses in a step-by-step and focused manner. The meeting also roughly determined the focus of study content, as well as teaching organization and teaching methods.

The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government has issued a circular to the cultural and educational departments of major administrative regions, requiring them to carry out work in accordance with the above guidelines, and also pointed out three key areas of political and ideological education in universities at this stage, based on the current international and domestic situation: first, to carry out ideological education against U.S. imperialist aggression, criticize ideas that harbor illusions about U.S. imperialism, explain the great tasks undertaken by the people of New China in defending the Far East and world peace, and promote patriotism and internationalism. Second, to implement land reform education, focusing on criticizing ideas that oppose land reform, and explaining that the abolition of feudal land ownership is a fundamental issue of the Chinese revolution; therefore, in addition to political courses, it is also necessary to study the Land Reform Law. Third, to carry out national morality education promoting the five loves. Regarding teaching methods, the circular stipulates: first, when conducting political education in universities, do not adopt methods such as ideological summaries, ideological examinations, rectification, confessions, introspection, and struggle meetings, but must focus on systematic theoretical knowledge, combined with the actual ideological situation of students, and solve students' ideological problems in a focused, systematic, and realistic manner, so as to improve students' political and ideological level. Evaluation of performance should be based primarily on theoretical study, and should be the responsibility of the teachers, with students allowed to discuss and provide opinions, but not generally adopt democratic evaluation methods. Second, school faculty and staff who voluntarily participate in political courses should be welcomed, but should not be required or forced, nor should their performance be evaluated in the same way as students. Third, when conducting political and ideological education in religious schools, do not stimulate religious feelings. The essence of religion can be explained based on theory, but do not launch mass anti-religious movements or organize anti-religious exhibitions and mass gatherings, etc.

Since the beginning of this semester, with the exception of a few newly liberated area schools, the vast majority of universities across the country have uniformly opened the required political course "History of Social Development" for first-year freshmen, and "Political Economics" for liberal arts colleges. Political course teaching organizations at all levels have also been universally established, and political courses in national universities are steadily advancing on a more standardized basis.

### 纠正思想改造中的过急偏向严格遵守共同纲领教育方针　全国高等学校政治课稳步展开

　　纠正思想改造中的过急偏向严格遵守共同纲领教育方针

    全国高等学校政治课稳步展开
    【本报讯】本报记者金凤报道：本学期全国高等学校政治课，经过总结过去一年经验、并纠正思想改造中若干过急偏向之后，现正严格根据共同纲领所规定的教育方针，有步骤，有计划地在各校稳步展开。
    一年来在全国人民进行政治学习的热潮中，大部分高等学校均先后设立政治课（一般内容都是社会发展史、新民主主义论及政治经济学）。在十三万大学生中间进行了比较正规而有系统的政治思想教育，大部分学生基本上打破了国民党匪帮反动宣传的影响，初步认识了马列主义的世界观与人生观。并开始批判了正统观念、狭隘民族主义以及知识分子优越感等错误思想，初步认识了劳动创造世界，阶级斗争等革命观点。一般高等学校已培养起进步的、为人民服务的空气。
    去年开始在高等学校进行政治思想教育时，由于这一工作完全是一种新的工作，各级教育干部对此缺乏经验，各校在进行政治课的教学过程中，也出现了方针不明、步骤不分、方式简单甚至粗暴，以及教学内容无重点、教学方法的教条主义等缺点。大多数学校都表现了过左偏向，笼统地提出“以无产阶级思想改造非无产阶级思想”的口号。而在实际执行时，锋芒又往往指向“个人主义”、“自由主义”、“单纯技术观点”等属于资产阶级或小资产阶级范畴的思想，反而忽略了政治教育首先应肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的三大敌人思想。其次，若干高等学校政治课的领导者对改造思想的长期性认识不足，因而采取了不讲步骤、不讲方式、不顾教师及学生觉悟程度的急躁措施。若干地区干部不加区别地在高等学校内机械地搬用干部教育、党内教育的方法，甚至错误地用“追”、“逼”、“斗争会”、“思想总结”等方式来解决思想问题。某大学还提出“把思想解放战争进行到底”的不恰当口号，其结果，不少学生为了避免遭受打击，牵强附会地把过去一切大小错误硬归结到一个“主导思想根源”上。但实际上并没有从思想上提高觉悟，反而增加了潜伏的反感，使进一步进行思想教育更加困难。
    暑期内，中央人民政府教育部召开了全国高等学校政治课教学讨论会，总结了一年来的工作，一方面肯定了主要的成绩，一方面严格批判了上述的偏向，明确具体地规定了今后高等学校政治课教学方针：必须严格根据共同纲领，首先坚决肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想；其次才是有步骤、有重点地帮助民族资产阶级及小资产阶级克服其违反科学真理和大众利益的思想。会议也大致确定了学习内容的重点以及教学组织和教学方法等。
    中央人民政府教育部为此已向各大行政区文教部发出通报，要求各地按照以上方针进行工作，同时并根据目前国际国内形势，指出现阶段高等学校的政治思想教育的三个重点：第一，进行反对美帝侵略的思想教育，批判对美帝存有幻想的思想，说明新中国人民对保卫远东及世界和平所担负的巨大任务，发扬爱国主义与国际主义。第二，贯彻土改教育，着重批判反对土改的思想，说明废除封建的土地所有制是中国革命的基本问题，因此除政治课外，还要学习土地改革法，第三，进行发扬五爱的国民公德教育。关于教学方法，通报中规定：第一，在高等学校进行政治教育时不要采取思想总结、思想检查、整风、坦白、反省及斗争大会等方式，必须着重以系统的理论知识，联系学生思想实际，有重点地、系统地、实事求是地解决学生的思想问题，提高学生的政治思想水平。评定成绩以理论学习为主要标准，由教员负责评定，学生可漫谈讨论，提供意见，不要一般地采取民主评定的方式。第二，学校教职员自愿参加政治课的应该欢迎，但不要规定或勉强，也不要对他们与学生一样评定成绩。第三，在教会学校进行政治思想教育时，不要刺激宗教感情。可根据理论说明宗教本质，不得发动群众性的反宗教运动或组织反宗教的展览会和群众集会等。
    本学期开始后，全国除少数新解放区学校以外，绝大多数高等学校已统一开办一年级新生的必修政治课“社会发展史”，文法学院开设“政治经济学”，政治课各级教学组织也已普遍设立，全国高等学校的政治课正在更为正规化的基础上稳步前进。
