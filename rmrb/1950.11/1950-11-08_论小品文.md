　　On the Essay
　　Chaslavsky
　　Editor's note: The following are two sections from "On the Essay" by Chaslavsky, a lecture handout from the Advanced Party School of the Central Committee of the CPSU. The essay is a common form of commentary in Soviet newspapers. It is regarded as a powerful weapon to educate the working people with communism, to correct shortcomings, to fight against the remnants of capitalism in people's minds, and to strike at the enemy. Learning to use this weapon is of extreme importance for helping us to carry out current affairs propaganda.
　　The Principled Difference Between Marxist Essays and Bourgeois Essays
　　The essay is one of the commentary forms of newspapers and magazines. The tasks undertaken by Soviet essays are consistent with the tasks of all Marxist-Leninist commentaries. It obeys the general requirements of this commentary.
　　Lenin defined the task of commentary in the article "Days of Revolution" as follows: "We should engage in the work of regular commentators, that is, to write the history of the time, and to write it in such a way that our commentary gives the greatest help to the direct participants in the movement and to the proletarian heroes engaged in actual struggle, so that the movement can expand and consciously choose the means, methods and ways of struggle. ..." (Note 1)
　　Lightness and perfection of literary style, pertinence, power, expressiveness, rich vocabulary, elements of satire and humor are the characteristics of Soviet essays. Thus, the essay belongs to the genre of commentary on the one hand, and is connected to the realm of artistic literature on the other.
　　Soviet essays have their own origins and classical predecessors different from bourgeois essays. This is revolutionary commentary.
　　Herzen once published the first publication of Russian free public opinion in London. In 1858, he received a letter from Russia. Generally, those who submitted articles to "The Bell" held a friendly attitude, but he expressed aversion to Herzen's ridicule of the Tsar and Russian senior officials. He believed that ridicule would reduce the significance of revolutionary publications and deprive the seriousness of the great historical significance of the cause Herzen was engaged in. He suggested that Herzen not ridicule.
　　Herzen replied:
　　"As for the level of ridicule, we do not entirely agree with this criticism of us. Ridicule is one of the most powerful weapons against all these things: they have died out or in fact remain important remnants, hindering the growth of new life and threatening the weak. ...
　　"Laughter is by no means a trivial matter, and we will not give way on this point. In the ancient world, watching Aristophanes and his comedies, people laughed on the divine mountains and on the earth, all the way to Lucian himself. From the fourth century onwards, people stopped laughing, they all cried, and heavy chains were put on painful and sad hearts. However, when superstitious fanaticism began to prevail, people began to laugh again, and writing a history of laughter might be a very interesting thing. Now, in churches, in courts, at the front lines, in front of directors, in front of police chiefs, in front of German managers, no one will laugh. In front of landlords, serfs are deprived of the right to laugh. Only between equal people can there be laughter.
　　"If the lower classes are allowed to laugh in front of the noble people, or if they cannot help but laugh, then the hierarchical obedience will disappear. Laughing at the sacred cow means demoting it from its sacred and dignified position to an ordinary cow." (Note 2)
　　These words of Herzen not only defined the significance and right of satire in combative commentary, but these words themselves are outstanding examples of revolutionary essays. The tone is full of vitality. Every sentence is a vivid portrait. Several of them put forward profound and meaningful ideas. The way to ridicule the sacred cow (that is, an ordinary cow) will always be engraved in people's memories.
　　Writing a history of laughter may be very interesting. To a large extent, this may be the history of revolutionary commentary. Herzen selected several milestones in the history of laughter, and even from his few words of description, it can be seen how much revolutionary power the laughter of a specific era in world history has.
　　Marx also briefly described the outline of the philosophy of laughter in his early work "Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right." We can easily apply concrete historical materialism to the general principles contained in this incisive description.
　　"The last form of world historical formation is comedy. The Greek god who suffered a fatal injury tragically in Aeschylus's 'Prometheus Bound' died comically in Lucian's 'Dialogues.' Why does history develop in this way? In order to make people bid farewell to the past with a smile. For the German regime, we demand such a pleasant historical assumption. ...
　　"Criticism that bears this task is combative criticism, and for combat, what is important is not whether the enemy is noble, whether the origin is appropriate, or whether he is interesting, but to give a painful blow. ... It is necessary to make actual oppression more cruel oppression, adding the consciousness of oppression to it; to make shame a more shameful shame, to promote it, ... It is necessary to move the conservative system, to sing its own melody to it! It is necessary to make the people feel threatened and muster their courage." (Note 3)
　　These words of Marx clearly explain the history of all class struggles and determine the significance of satire in the combat commentary of the working class. It is not difficult to see that Marx and Herzen said the same thing. They partially adopted the same method. Both of them talked about the Greek gods and Lucian—the greatest satirist in the ancient world. However, Marx comprehended phenomena and concepts more profoundly. At the same time, the passage quoted here is itself a revolutionary commentary, an outstanding example of powerful writing and beautiful literary style.
　　In the preface to the second edition of "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte" in 1869, Marx talked about the historical significance of various satirical methods: "... French literature, with the help of historical research, criticism, satire, ridicule and other weapons, ended forever with the story of Napoleon." (Note 4) In this way, if this ridicule is heading in the right direction, if it is fighting for successfully selected goals, then ridicule even walks into the arsenal of combat.
　　In his preface, Marx pointed out the fundamental principled difference between bourgeois satire and Marxist satire. This pointing out is also completely applicable to Soviet essays.
　　Hugo's "Napoleon the Little" and Proudhon's "Coup d'État" were also published at the same time as Marx's pamphlet "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte." Both books are aimed at Napoleon III personally.
　　Hugo was a great French writer. Proudhon was an outstanding French commentator. He was not only very popular among the petty bourgeoisie (he himself was a petty-bourgeois ideologist), but also among the working class. Hugo's and Proudhon's pamphlets were written in a powerful and expressive style. They contain anger and warnings. At the time, their pamphlets were very popular and circulated more widely than Marx's pamphlets. However, they were soon forgotten. Their literary flames were extinguished, their styles were regarded as extravagant, and their warnings partially lost their meaning. And Marx's pamphlet is still alive and remains a classic example of combat political literature. An increasingly broad readership is repeatedly reading it. Its excellence lies not only in the perfection of its literary style, but also in its extreme theoretical profundity.
　　Marx wrote:
　　"Hugo organizes strong and sharp personal attacks against those who are legally responsible for the coup d'état. In his opinion, this event is simply a bolt from the blue. He regards this event as an act of violence by one person. He did not see what made this person appear great rather than small, making him obtain unprecedented personal power in world history. Proudhon tried to describe the coup d'état as the result of historical development in the past. However, he did not see that the historical description of the coup d'état would become the historical justification for the protagonist of the coup d'état. He thus fell into the error of what we call an objective historian. I want to point out that the class struggle in France created such an environment and conditions that it allowed a ridiculous mediocrity to play the role of a hero." (Note 5)
　　Hugo's commentary is a personal attack. The basis of Marx's commentary is class struggle. Bourgeois liberals have a primitive understanding of history. The fighters of the working class have a scientific world view. The power of Marx's ridicule lies in this. The weakness of Hugo's strong and sharp attack also lies in this.
　　Hugo once gave a huge influence to bourgeois essays. Hugo obtained the capable and proverbial style of the pre-revolutionary Russian essay writer Doroshevich. The success of Doroshevich's essays, as well as those bourgeois essay writers who imitated him, lies in their literary skills and sharp attacks on individuals. However, this success is temporary and superficial. Randomly written short articles have degenerated into dull chattering.
　　The scientific world view of the working class—Marxism-Leninism is the basis of Marxist-Leninist commentary. For Soviet essays, this is also indispensable. Only under this condition can ridicule become a combat tool. Only under this condition can sharp writing and expressive words have metaphors with profound meaning.

　　Satire and Humor in Marxist-Leninist Classical Works
　　All the works of Marx and Engels are rich in satire, sharp epigrams, and merciless ridicule of the enemy.
　　In this regard, Lenin and Stalin are their glorious successors. Works such as Marx's "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte" and "Herr Vogt" are full of excellent examples of strong satire, sharp and outstanding titles, and merciless ridicule of the enemy. However, even in those serious theoretical studies that are partially dry and abstract in appearance, such as the first few chapters of "Capital," Marx still uses artistic forms of great power in annotations, sometimes in the text itself—it is often satirical, and in it one can see Marx's profound and comprehensive study of the classical literature of various nations and historical periods.
　　Marx and Engels brilliantly mastered the weapon of laughter. They made ridicule occupy a prominent and glorious position in the "New Rheinische Zeitung" (as Lenin called it, this is the most perfect proletarian newspaper).
　　Engels wrote in "Marx and the 'New Rheinische Zeitung'":
　　"The tone of the newspaper is not entirely solemn, serious, and ardent. We encounter despicable enemies everywhere, and we treat them with the most contemptuous attitude without exception. Monarchs, royalists, aristocrats, the 'Kreuzzeitung' who collude with each other—in a word, all 'reactionaries' who arouse such moral indignation in hypocrites—we only have satire and ridicule for them." (Note 1) Marx and Engels' newspaper also treated the bourgeoisie with this attitude. "From the first issue, the newspaper published articles that ridiculed the French parliament for being nominal, ridiculed the lengthy speeches made in the parliament for being aimless, and ridiculed the parliament's timid resolutions for being completely useless." (Note 2)
　　Ridicule of the enemy will not be striking if it does not have the revolutionary enthusiasm to fight for the cause of the working class. Regarding ridicule, Engels continued: "... It is actually noticed that while ridiculing the German enemy, ardent emotions are also revealed." (Note 3)
　　The "New Rheinische Zeitung" consistently published essays from the first issue to the last. Marx and Engels attached great importance to essays. Many of their own articles are classic examples of revolutionary proletarian essays. The main writer who regularly wrote essays for the "New Rheinische Zeitung" was Georg Weerth. Regarding him, Engels wrote: "Weerth engaged in writing essays, and I don't believe there have ever been such vivid and sharply written essays in other newspapers. 'The Life of the Famous Knight Schnapphahnski' is one of his major works; it describes the adventures of Duke Lichnowski, which the Germans call 'Ada Trolli.' All the facts are in line with the actual situation. ..." (Note 4)
　　Weerth used poetry and prose to write essays. Engels said: "I call him the first and best poet of the German proletariat. Indeed, in terms of creativity, sharp writing, and especially ardent emotions, his socialist and political poems are much better than Freiligrath's poems." (Note 5)
　　Marx and Engels demanded that all proletarian newspapers should give full play to satire, sharp writing, and humor, because satire and humor are inherent in the proletarian revolutionary movement itself. In 1881, Engels commented on a foreign newspaper run by the German Social Democratic Party and talked about the necessity of "free air" in the newspaper. He wrote: "This free air should be brought into Germany. For this, it is necessary to first write about the enemy in a contemptuous and ridiculing tone. As long as the public is re-taught to ridicule the likes of Bismarck, this will be a huge achievement... Now it is necessary to improve humor and constantly remind: The likes of Bismarck are all fools, rascals, and pitifully weak and small figures in the face of historical development, just as they were when they were not in power. In this way, any sharp words about these rascals are valuable." (Note 6)
　　Engels's emphasis on humor is the same as his emphasis on satire. Humor is a characteristic of a strong and optimistic class that has a fighting will, has confidence in its victory, and has an advantage over the enemy. Engels wrote in 1833, "Our enemies can never take away our humor." Later, in a farewell letter to the readers of the "Sozialdemokrat," he said: "... At that time, just like the lifelessness of the bourgeois newspapers, the 'Sozialdemokrat' also widely rejected pleasant humor, and humor is a means that our workers often use to fight against police conspiracies." (Note 7)
　　In the preface to "The Peasant War in Germany," Engels talked about the struggle of German workers during the period of the anti-socialist law. He wrote: "Most of them fought in a humorous way, and humor is a sign that workers have confidence in their cause and that they have an advantage." (Note 8)
　　Engels called ridicule of the enemy the "most beneficial" form of struggle under certain historical conditions. "It first supported our youth's contempt for the enemy." (Note 9)
　　All these instructions of Engels are still fully applicable to Soviet news essays. These instructions say that humor and ridicule of the enemy are not mere newspaper "decorations." The task of the essay is not only to make the newspaper lively (this in itself is important), but also to adopt a very serious method of literary struggle and give educational influence to readers.
　　Pointing out that a certain noble politician in a capitalist country is a trivial hypocrite—this sometimes means demoting the sacred cow to an ordinary cow.
　　Just like the works of Marx and Engels, all of Lenin and Stalin's literary activities are rich in satirical elements. The Bolsheviks have always brilliantly mastered the weapon of ridiculing the enemy. They educate people to despise the enemy (this does not mean underestimating the enemy's power), ridiculing the enemy's ignorance, stupidity, and cowardice. In the commentaries of Lenin and Stalin, we find outstanding classical examples of using artistic forms and metaphors for this purpose. Just like Marx and Engels, Lenin and Stalin attached great importance to sharp writing, strong ridicule, and sharp writing that correctly selected the target. They widely adopted satirical examples from world classical literature. They were proficient in Gogol, Griboyedov, and Shchedrin.
　　Lenin's "On Climbing High Mountains, On the Harm of Depression" and "Commentary Essays" are written in a profound and expressive style. Lenin adopted such a style that it is shown just as powerful and brave people overcome difficulties. The task of this article is to ridicule opportunists and cowards. In terms of its artistic form, this is an extraordinary essay. It was written in a genius style by a fearless revolutionary and the great strategist of the proletarian revolution. This essay cannot be quoted. Every Soviet journalist must read its entire text and study it carefully as an unparalleled example of a powerful and expressive style.
　　The powerful tone in Comrade Stalin's speech "On the Right Deviation in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" serves this purpose—to fight against opportunists, panic-stricken people, and cowards. Comrade Stalin brought up a story from his life in exile in Siberia:
　　"Have you ever seen a fisherman in the middle of a big river, like the Yenisei, encountering a storm? I have seen them many times. There is a kind of fisherman who, when encountering a storm, mobilizes all his strength, encourages his own heart, and bravely braves the storm to row: 'Brothers, don't be weak, try to grab the rudder and move forward through the waves, we will definitely win!' And another kind of fisherman, as soon as he hears the storm, feels discouraged, complains endlessly, and makes all his team members dispirited: 'What a misfortune, a storm is coming, brothers, lie under the deck, close your eyes, maybe you can luckily get to the shore.'" (Note 10)
　　Comrade Stalin's satirical method in the report on the Soviet Constitution at the Eighth Extraordinary Congress of Soviets is very famous. With the help of Shchedrin's "Enthusiastic Officer" and Gogol's Pilagge girl, Comrade Stalin inflicted a deadly blow-like ridicule on those bourgeois critics of the Constitution.
　　In Lenin's works, we often encounter examples of using dialectics. The article "From Step to Step" exposes the betrayal of the Constitutional Democrats. It ends with the following paragraph:
　　"Miliukov visited Stolypin and said: 'Your Excellency, please take a look, I have already divided the revolution and taken the moderates out of the revolution! Your Excellency, let's talk' ... Stolypin said: 'Yes, I want to appeal for you to be recognized. You know, Pavel Nikolaevich, you use caressing means to divide the worker villains, and I want to use a stick to divide them. We are doing it from two sides. ... Well, let's talk, Pavel Nikolaevich!'" (Note 11)
　　Comrade Stalin used memorable dialogues to ridicule "loyal babblers" in the report at the Seventeenth Party Congress:
　　"I asked: What is the situation of your sowing work?
　　"He replied: Comrade Stalin, are you asking about the sowing work? We have already mobilized. (Laughter)
　　"I asked: What is the result?
　　"He replied: We have put forward this question directly. (Laughter)
　　"I asked: What happened later?
　　"He replied: Comrade Stalin, we have had a transformation, and there will be a transformation soon. (Laughter)
　　"I asked: What exactly?
　　"He replied: A kind of progress has begun to appear in our place. (Laughter)
　　"I asked: What is the situation of your sowing work?
　　"He replied: Our sowing work has not even started yet, Comrade Stalin. (The whole audience burst into laughter)" (Note 12)
　　Comrade Stalin often used satirical methods and ridiculing Russian proverbs in speeches during the Patriotic War.
　　Comparing Hitler to a kitten pretending to be a lion is extremely powerful:
　　"They mentioned Napoleon and said with certainty that Hitler's actions were very similar to Napoleon, saying that he was like Napoleon in every point. However, first, don't forget Napoleon's fate here. Second, Hitler is like Napoleon, just like a kitten is like a lion. (Laughter, thunderous applause) ..." (Note 13)
　　The Soviet people laughed in unison when Comrade Stalin talked about the fate of the Hitler group:
　　"The participants in the Hitler group hoped for a quick victory when they joined the war. They had already pre-allocated who should get what: who should get bread and oil cakes, and who should get bruises and bumps (laughter). Obviously, they had scheduled bruises and bumps for the enemy, and bread and oil cakes for themselves. But now it is clear that Germany and its partners will not get bread and oil cakes, and now they will have to share bruises and bumps with each other. (Laughter, applause)" (Note 14)
　　Comrade Stalin used the proverb "Beating a wolf is not because it is ugly, but because it eats sheep" in his report to clearly explain Hitler Germany's responsibility for the criminal war and for crimes during the war.
　　Lenin demanded that Bolshevik newspapers be good at ridiculing the enemy, be good at sharp and ardent debate, be good at expressing anger in articles, and be good at eliminating the remnants of capitalism with ridicule. Lenin said that without irony and without argument, the newspaper's revelations would become monotonous and boring. Therefore, Lenin demanded that Bolshevik newspapers, in addition to other commentaries, should also have satirical essays.
　　In 1912, Lenin wrote a letter to the editorial department of "Neva Star" and said:
　　"You are troubled by monotony. But if you don't start an argument, it will always be monotonous. ... Socialist newspapers should argue. ... The problem is: argue vividly, or put forward problems in isolation, or defend boringly." (Note 15) Lenin demanded that "Pravda" "be lively, publish some argumentative articles and essays against Axelrod and others. ... In addition to publishing two 'positive' papers, 'Pravda' should also publish argumentative articles and essays ridiculing liquidators, etc." (Note 16)
　　In 1918, in the famous article "On the Nature of Our Newspapers," Lenin accused the Soviet newspapers of not being able to appropriately use their anger and all their revolutionary enthusiasm to fight against the chaos, disconnection, filth, idleness, and parasitism in enterprises. Lenin wrote: "As long as we remain silent and tolerate such factories for a day, then we are not Communists, but collectors of rags and waste paper. We still cannot conduct class struggle in newspapers as the bourgeoisie did. Please recall how skillfully they used to hunt their class enemies in newspapers, how they ridiculed them, how they insulted them, and how they abused them." (Note 17)
　　Of course, the conditions under which Soviet newspapers fought in 1918 have now fundamentally changed. Capitalism in our country has been completely eliminated. However, the remnants of capitalism in people's minds can still be felt very much. To fight against these remnants is a task of great historical importance. The communist education of the working people includes the struggle against the remnants of capitalism in people's minds. Soviet newspapers should, as in the past, master the sharp weapons of ridicule and satire. Needless to say, there is still a capitalist encirclement of the Soviet Union, and efforts should be made in newspapers to fight against the representatives of this encirclement, its theorists, anti-Soviet slanders, and open and hidden defenders of fascism.
　　In a report in 1921, Lenin demanded that Soviet newspapers speak out against the British Labour Party and Labour Party members. He wrote:
　　"In my opinion, two measures should be taken now: First, publish several widely praised articles in the newspaper ridiculing the so-called European democratic views on the Georgian issue; Second, immediately entrust a sharp-writing journalist to write a draft of the most polite note in reply to the British Labour Party. ... In general, this draft note should be the most polite and very popular (understandable to a ten-year-old child) ridicule of the stupid leaders of the British Labour Party." (Note 18)
　　The combination of deep ridicule content and the correct tone in the form of the article requires the journalist to have a high degree of writing skills. Ridicule should not be rude. Hitting the enemy is not by "strong" words, but by hitting the key point. The above-mentioned instructions of Lenin can be used by Soviet "sharp-writing" essay writers for learning.

### 论小品文
查斯拉夫斯基

第5版()
专栏：

　　论小品文
    查斯拉夫斯基
    编者按：下面是联共中央高级党校新闻班讲义查斯拉夫斯基所著《论小品文》一文中的两节。小品文是苏联报纸上常见的评论文字之一种。它被当作以共产主义教育劳动人民、纠正缺点、与人们意识中资本主义残余作斗争和打击敌人的有力的武器。学会使用这个武器，对于帮助我们目前所进行的时事宣传，具有极其重要的意义。              
    马克思主义的小品文和资产阶级的小品文之间的原则性区别
    小品文是报纸和杂志的评论形式之一种。苏联小品文所负担的任务，与一切马克思列宁主义的评论的任务是一致的。它服从这种评论的总要求。
    列宁在《革命的日子》一文里这样确定评论的任务：“我们应该从事经常的评论家工作，这就是写当时的历史，并且这么样地写，以便使我们的评论对运动的直接参加者和对从事实际斗争的无产阶级英雄给以最大的帮助，以便使运动能够扩大并且自觉地选择斗争的手段、方式和方法。……”（注一）
    轻松和文学风格的完美、中肯、有力、善于表达、词藻丰富、讽刺和幽默因素，这些就是苏联小品文的特点。这样，小品文一方面属于评论文体裁，同时又与艺术文学的境界相接。
    苏联小品文具有一种与资产阶级小品文不同的自己的渊源和古典先驱者。这就是革命的评论。
    赫尔岑曾经在伦敦出版俄国自由舆论界的第一个刊物，他在一八五八年接到一封从俄罗斯写来的信。向赫尔岑投函者一般地对《警钟报》抱着善意的态度，但是他对于赫尔岑的嘲笑沙皇和俄国高级官僚表示厌恶。他认为，嘲笑会降低革命刊物的意义，并且会剥夺赫尔岑所从事的伟大的具有历史意义的事业的严肃性。他建议赫尔岑不要嘲笑。
    赫尔岑回答说：
    “至于嘲笑一层，我们不完全同意对我们的这个批评。嘲笑是最有力的武器之一，用以反对这一切东西：它们已经死灭或者实际上还保持为重要的残余，阻碍着新的生活的成长并威胁着弱小者。……
    “笑决不是一件滑稽事情，我们不会在这一点上让步。古代世界上，看着亚里斯多芬和他的喜剧，人们在神山上，在大地上笑，一直笑到鲁善自己。从第四世纪起，人们停止了笑，人们都哭了，沉重的锁链套上了沉痛而悲伤的心。然而当迷信狂热开始流行的时候，人们又开始笑了，写一部笑的历史也许是一件非常有趣的事情。到了现在，在教堂里，在宫廷里，在前线上，在司长面前，在警察局长面前，在德国经理面前，谁也不会笑。在地主面前，农奴被剥夺了笑的权利。平等的人之间才会笑。
    “如果下层的人被允许在高贵的人面前笑，或者他们不禁失笑，这时候，等级性的服从就消失了。对着圣牛发笑，这就意味着把它从神圣的尊严地位贬为平凡的一条牛”。（注二）
    赫尔岑的这几句话不仅确定了战斗性评论的讽刺的意义和权利。而且这几句话本身就是革命小品的杰出范例。语调充沛着生气。每句话都是活生生的画像。其中好几句话都提出了深刻和意味深长的思想。对圣牛（就是一条平凡的牛）的嘲笑方式，永远会刻在人们的记忆里。
    写一部笑的历史也许是很有趣的。这在很大的程度上也许就是革命评论的历史。赫尔岑选定了笑史上的若干里程碑，甚至从他寥寥数语的描写里表现出：世界历史上特定时代的笑具有何等的革命力量。
    马克思在他的早年著作《黑格尔权利哲学批判》里也曾经简略地描述了笑的哲学的大概。我们很容易把具体的历史唯物主义来应用于这个精辟的描述中所包含的一般原则。
    “世界历史形态的最后形式就是笑剧。曾经在艾斯基拉斯的《锁住了的普罗米修斯》里悲剧式地遭受致命伤害的希腊天神，在鲁善的《对话》里又喜剧式地死亡了。为什么历史这样发展呢？为了要使人们含笑与过去的事情告别。为了德国的政权，我们要求这样的愉快的历史的假定。……
    “负有这种任务的批评，就是战斗的批评，而对于战斗来讲，重要的不在于敌人是否高贵，出身是否相当，他是否有趣，重要的在于要给以痛击。……必须使实际的压迫成为更酷烈的压迫，对它添加压迫的意识；使耻辱成为更可耻的耻辱，加以宣传，……必须使守旧的制度动起来，向它歌唱它自己的旋律！必须使人民感到威胁，鼓起他们的勇气”。（注三）
    马克思这几句话明白地说明了一切阶级斗争的历史，并且确定了工人阶级的战斗的评论里，讽刺的意义。不难看出，马克思和赫尔岑的说法是一样的。他们部分地采用了一样的方式。他们两人都谈到希腊天神和鲁善——古代世界最伟大的讽刺家。然而马克思更深刻无比地领会了现象和概念。同时，这里所援引的一段本身就是革命评论，有力的文笔和优美文学风格的杰出的实例。
    马克思一八六九年在《拿破仑第三政变记》第二版序言里谈到各种讽刺方式的历史意义：“……借助于历史研究、批评、讽刺、嘲笑等武器的法国文学，与拿破仑的故事一道永远结束了。”（注四）这样，如果这种嘲笑是朝着正确的方向，如果它是为了成功地选定的目标而战斗，那末嘲笑甚至也走进战斗的武器库里了。
    马克思在他的序言里指出资产阶级讽刺与马克思主义讽刺之间极根本的原则性区别。对于苏联小品文来讲，这个指出也是完全适用的。
    雨果的《小拿破仑》和蒲鲁东的《政变》两小册子，也与马克思的《拿破仑第三政变记》小册子同时问世。这两本书都是针对着拿破仑第三个人的。
    雨果是法国伟大作家。蒲鲁东是法国杰出评论家，他不仅在小资产阶级（他自己就是小资产阶级意识者）中间很有声望，就是在工人阶级中间也是如此。雨果和蒲鲁东的小册子都是以有力的和善于表达的笔调写成的。其中含有愤怒和警语。当时他们的小册子很风行，比马克思的小册子流传得更普遍。然而它们不久就被遗忘了。它们的文学火焰息灭了，它们的风格被看作是奢华的，它们的警语也部分地失去了意味。而马克思的小册子仍然活着，仍然保持为战斗的政治文学的古典范例。愈来愈广大的读者阶层在反复地读着它。它杰出的地方不仅在于它文学风格的完美，而且在于它极度的理论深刻性。
    马克思写道：
    “雨果对于负政变事件法律责任的人组织了强烈的锐利的人身攻击。在他看来，这个事件简直是晴天霹雳。他把这个事件看作是一个人的暴力行为。他没有看出，是什么使得这个人表现为巨大而不是渺小的，使得他取得了世界历史上空前无比的个人权力。蒲鲁东则试图把政变说成以往历史发展的结果。然而他没有看出，政变的历史描写会变成政变主角的历史辩解。他就因而陷入了我们所谓客观主义历史家的错误。我要指出，阶级斗争在法国造成了这样的环境和条件：它允许一个可笑的庸人演出英雄角色。”（注五）
    雨果的评论里是人身攻击。马克思的评论的基础是阶级斗争。资产阶级自由派具有对历史的原始理解。工人阶级的斗士具有科学的世界观。马克思嘲笑的力量就在于此。雨果的强烈而尖锐的攻击之软弱无力，其根源也就在此。
    雨果曾经对资产阶级小品文给以巨大的影响。雨果取得了俄国革命前小品文作家杜罗谢维奇的精干和谚语体裁的风格。杜罗谢维奇以及模仿他的那些资产阶级小品文作家们的小品文之所以成功，其原因就在于他们的文学技巧和对个人的尖刻的攻击。然而这种成功是暂时和表面的。乱写的短文章已经退化为乏味的饶舌。
    工人阶级科学的世界观——马克思列宁主义是马克思列宁主义评论的基础。对于苏联小品文来说，这也是必不可缺少的。只有在这个条件之下，嘲笑才能成为战斗的工具。只有在这个条件之下，笔调锋利和善于表达的文字才能具有含着深刻意义的隐喻。

    马克思列宁主义古典著作中的讽刺和幽默成分
    马克思和恩格斯的全部著作里都富有讽刺、尖锐的隽语以及对敌人毫不容情的嘲笑。
    在这一点上，列宁和斯大林是他们光荣的继承者。像《拿破仑第三政变记》和《福格脱先生》等等马克思的作品里，处处都提出强烈讽刺，尖锐而出色的称呼以及对敌人毫不容情的嘲笑的优秀范例。然而，即使在那些部分地枯燥并且在外表风格上现得抽象的严肃的理论研究中，譬如《资本论》的前面几章，马克思仍然在注解里，有时就在正文里运用具有极大力量的艺术形式——它常常是讽刺性的，并且在这里面可以看出马克思对于各民族和各历史时代的古典文学具有深刻的和全面的研究。
    马克思和恩格斯卓越地掌握着笑的武器。他们使嘲笑在《新莱茵新闻》（如列宁所称呼，这是最完美的无产阶级报纸）里占着显著和光荣的地位。
    恩格斯在“马克思与《新莱茵新闻》”一文里写道：
    “报纸的笔调并不完全是庄重、严肃和热烈的。我们到处都遇到可鄙的敌人，我们无例外地以最轻蔑的态度对待他们。狼狈为奸的君主，保皇派，贵族，《十字报》——一言以蔽之，一切“反动派”，他们激起伪善者如此的道义上愤怒——而我们对他们只有讽刺和嘲笑。”（注一）马克思和恩格斯的报纸，也以这种态度对待资产阶级。“从第一期起，报纸就刊登这样的文章：它们嘲笑法国议会徒具虚名，嘲笑议会里发表的冗长演说毫无目的，嘲笑议会胆怯的决议完全无用”。（注二）
    对敌人的嘲笑如果不具有为工人阶级事业而斗争的革命热情，它就不会有打击力。关于嘲笑，恩格斯接着说：“……实际上是注意到：在对德国敌人嘲笑的同时，也现出了热烈的感情。”（注三）
    《新莱茵新闻》从第一期到最末一期，一贯地刊登了小品文。马克思和恩格斯对小品文很重视。他们自己许多文章就是革命无产阶级小品文的古典范例。经常给《新莱茵新闻》写小品的主要作家是乔治·维耶尔特。关于他，恩格斯写道：“维耶尔特从事写小品文，我不相信曾经在其他报纸还会有过这样生动和文笔锋利的小品文。《著名骑士希纳普甘斯基的生平》是他主要作品之一；其中描写里赫诺夫斯基公爵的冒险，这被德国人称为“阿达·特罗里”。一切事实都是符合实际情形的。……”（注四）
    维耶尔特用诗和散文来写小品。恩格斯说：“我称他为德国无产阶级第一个最优秀的诗人。的确，就其创造力，就笔调锋利来讲，尤其是就其热烈感情来讲，他的社会主义和政治性的诗，比弗列里格拉特的诗好得多。”（注五）
    马克思和恩格斯要求一切无产阶级的报纸都发挥讽刺、锋利的笔调和幽默，因为讽刺和幽默是无产阶级革命运动本身所固有的。一八八一年，恩格斯在评论一家由德国社会民主党办的外国报纸时谈到了报纸上“自由空气”的必要性，他写道：“这种自由空气应该带进德国去，为此，必须首先以轻蔑和嘲笑的笔调来写敌人。只要公众再度被教会嘲笑俾士麦之辈，这就会是一个巨大的成就……现在必须提高幽默，并且经常提醒：俾士麦之辈都是些蠢汉、流氓以及在历史发展面前可怜的无力的渺小人物，正如在他们未当权时一样。这样，关于这些流氓的任何笔调锋利的话都是有价值的。”（注六）
    恩格斯对幽默的重视，正如对讽刺的重视一样。幽默是坚强而乐观的阶级的特色，这个阶级怀着战斗意志，对自己的胜利具有信心，比敌人占着优势。恩格斯在一八三三年写道，“我们的敌人永远不能夺走我们的幽默”。后来，在致《社会民主》报读者的告别信里，他说：“……那个时候，正如资产阶级报纸的死气沉沉一样，《社会民主》报也广泛地拒绝愉快的幽默，而幽默是我们工人常常用以对警察阴谋进行斗争的手段。”（注七）
    恩格斯在《德国农民战争》序言里谈到德国工人在反社会党人立法时期的斗争，他写道：“他们大部分是以幽默方式进行斗争的，幽默是表明工人对自己事业具有信心并且表明自己占着优势的标志。”（注八）
    恩格斯把对于敌人的嘲笑称为一定历史条件下“最有益的”斗争形式。“它首先支持了我们青年对敌人的轻蔑态度”。（注九）
    对于苏联的新闻小品来讲，恩格斯这一切指示仍然完全适用的。这些指示是说：对敌人的幽默和嘲笑，不是单纯的报纸“装饰品”，小品文的任务不仅在于使报纸有生气（这一点本身也是重要的），其任务还在于采用很认真的文学斗争方式，并且对读者给以教育影响。
    指出资本主义国家某个高贵大政客为微不足道的伪善者——这有时候就意味着把圣牛贬为一条平凡的牛。
    正如马克思和恩格斯的作品一样，列宁和斯大林的全部文学活动里都富于讽刺的因素。布尔什维克党人一向卓越地掌握着对敌人嘲笑的武器，他们教育人们轻蔑敌人（这并不意味着对敌人的力量估计不足），嘲笑敌人的无知、愚蠢和懦弱。在列宁和斯大林的评论里，我们找到为了这个目的而运用艺术形式，运用隐喻的杰出的古典范例。正如马克思和恩格斯一样，列宁和斯大林很重视尖锐的文笔，强烈的嘲笑以及正确选定了对象的锋利笔调。他们广泛采用世界古典文学里的讽刺范例，他们精通果戈里，格里波耶道夫和谢德林。
    列宁《论走上高山，论消沉的害处》的《评论随笔》是以深刻的、善于表达的笔法写成的。列宁采用这样的笔法，它表现得正如强有力而勇敢的人克服了困难，这篇文章的任务在于嘲笑机会主义者和胆怯者。就其艺术形式来讲，这是一篇非凡的小品文，它是被无畏的革命家，无产阶级革命的伟大战略家以天才的笔调写成的。这篇小品文不能摘引。苏联每个新闻工作者，必须读它的全篇，并且把它作为有力而善于表达的笔调的无与伦比的范例而熟读之。
    斯大林同志“论联共（布）党内的右倾”的演说里的强有力语调就是服务于这个目的——对机会主义者，对惊慌失措者，对胆怯者进行斗争。斯大林同志提起他在流放西伯利亚时期生活里的一段故事：
    “你们看见过大河中间，比方在叶尼塞这样一条大河中间遇见大风浪时的渔夫么？我看见过他们多次。有一种渔夫遇见大风浪到来时，就动员自己所有的力量，鼓励自己的人心，大胆冒着风浪划船：‘弟兄们，不要软劲，努力抓着舵，破浪前进吧，我们是一定会胜利的！’而另一种渔夫一闻见大风浪，就灰心丧气，叫苦连天，使自己所有队伍的精神颓废：‘真倒霉呀，大风浪来了，弟兄们，卧在船板底下，闭着眼睛，也许可以侥幸挨得到岸边去的’。”（注十）
    斯大林同志在第八届苏维埃临时大会上关于苏联宪法的报告里的讽刺方式是很著名的。在谢德林“热心的长官”和果戈里的毕拉格女孩的帮助之下，斯大林同志向那些资产阶级的对宪法的批评者加以一种致命打击似的嘲笑。
    在列宁的著作里，我们不止一次地遇见运用辩证法的范例。《从一步到一步》这篇文章揭露立宪民主党人的叛卖，它是以这样一段话结束的：
    “米留考夫谒见斯托雷平时说：‘阁下请看看，我已经分化了革命，并且从革命里取出了温和派！阁下，我们来谈谈’……斯托雷平说：“对，我要为你获得公认而呼吁。你知道，派维尔·尼古拉维奇，你是用爱抚手段来分裂工人恶徒，我要用棍子来分裂他们。我们是从两个方面来作的。……好，谈谈罢，派维尔·尼古拉维奇！”（注十一）
    斯大林同志在党的第十七次大会上的报告里用可记忆的对话来嘲笑“忠实的爱说废话的人”：
    “我问：你们的播种工作情形怎样呢？
    “他回答：斯大林同志，你是问播种工作情形么？我们已经动员了。（笑声）
    “我问：结果怎样呢？
    “他回答：我们已把这问题直截了当地提出来了。（笑声）
    “我问：后来又是怎样呢？
    “他回答：斯大林同志，我们已有了转变，很快就会有转变了。（笑声）
    “我问：究竟怎样呢？
    “他回答：在我们那里已开始呈现出一种进展。（笑声）
    “我问：你们的播种工作情形究竟怎样呢？
    “他回答：我们的播种工作暂时还没有丝毫头绪哩，斯大林同志。（全场哈哈大笑）”（注十二）
    斯大林同志在卫国战争期间发表的演说里，常常采用讽刺方法以及嘲笑性的俄罗斯谚语。
    把希特勒比作是自命为狮子的小猫，这是极其有力的：
    “他们提到拿破仑，就肯定地说希特勒的行动很像拿破仑，说他每一点都像拿破仑。但是，第一、在这里可不要忘记拿破仑的命运。第二、希特勒之像拿破仑，犹如小猫之像狮子。（大笑，掌声如雷）……”（注十三）
    苏联人民异口同声地都笑了，当斯大林同志讲到希特勒集团的命运的时候：
    “希特勒集团的参加者在加入战争的时候，是指望速胜的。他们已经预先分配谁该得到什么东西：谁该得面饼和油糕，谁该得青伤和肿块（笑声）。显而易见，他们是把青伤和肿块预定给敌人，而把面饼和油糕预定给自己。但是现在很清楚，德国和他的同伙不会得到面饼和油糕，现在他们势必要互相分派一下青伤和钟块了。（笑声、鼓掌）”（注十四）
    斯大林同志在报告中用这一句“打狼不是因为它难看，而是因为它吃羊”的谚语，来明白地说明希特勒德国对于犯罪战争以及对于战争期间罪行的责任问题。
    列宁要求布尔什维克报纸善于嘲笑敌人，善于尖锐而热烈地论战，善于在文章里表现愤怒，善于用嘲笑的话来消灭资本主义残余。列宁说，没有讽刺意味，没有争论，报纸的揭发就成了单调而枯燥的。因此列宁要求在布尔什维克报纸上除了有其他评论文之外，还要有讽刺性小品文。
    列宁在一九一二年写信给《涅瓦星报》编辑部说：
    “你们为单调而感到苦恼。但是，如果不展开争论的话，这永远是单调的。……社会主义的报纸应该进行争论。……问题在于：生动地争论，还是孤立地提出问题，还是枯燥乏味地辩解。”（注十五）列宁要求《真理报》“富于生气，刊登一些反对阿克塞罗德等人的争论文章和小品文。……《真理报》除了登出两篇‘正面的’论文之外，还应该登载争论的文章以及嘲笑取消派的小品文等等”。（注十六）
    一九一八年列宁在著名的《论我们报纸的性质》一文里责备苏维埃报纸还不会适当地以它的愤怒，以它的全部革命热情来对企业里的混乱现象，对脱节现象，对龌龊、闲散和寄生现象进行斗争。列宁写道：“只要我们沉默、容忍这样的工厂一天，那么我们便不是共产党员，而是收拾破布烂纸者。我们还不会像资产阶级所作的那样，在报纸上来进行阶级斗争。请回想一下吧，他们曾经如何巧妙地在报纸上猎获他们的阶级敌人，如何嘲笑他们，如何侮辱他们，如何虐待他们。”（注十七）
    当然，一九一八年时苏维埃报纸进行斗争的条件现在已经根本改变了。我们国家里的资本主义已经完全消灭。然而人们意识里的资本主义残余仍然很可以感觉出来。对这种残余进行斗争，是具有伟大历史重要性的任务。对劳动人民的共产主义教育里就包含着对人们意识里资本主义残余的斗争。苏联报纸应该和过去一样地掌握嘲笑和讽刺的锐利武器。不待说，现在还存在着对苏联的资本主义的包围，还要在报纸上努力对这种包围的代表者，对它的理论家，对反苏诽谤，对公开和暗藏的法西斯维护者进行斗争。
    列宁在一九二一年的报告里要求苏维埃报纸发言斥责英国工党和工党分子。他写道：
    “在我看来，现在应该采取这样两个措施：一、在报上刊登几篇获得普遍赞成的文章，嘲笑乔治亚问题上的所谓欧洲民主的观点；二、立即委托一位文笔锋利的新闻记者写一个最客气的照会的草案，答复英国工党。……一般地说，这个照会草案应该是对于英国工党愚笨的领袖最客气和非常通俗（十岁孩童就看得懂）的嘲笑。”（注十八）
    深刻的嘲笑内容与文章形式上的正确语气这两者的结合，需要新闻记者具有高度的写作技巧。嘲笑不应该是粗鲁的。对敌人的打击不是靠“强烈”的言词，而是靠恰恰击中要害。以上所举出的列宁的指示，都可以供苏联“文笔锋利”的小品文作家学习。（何疆译）
