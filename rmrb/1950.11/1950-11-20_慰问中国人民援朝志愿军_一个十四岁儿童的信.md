　　Condolences to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

　　A Fourteen-Year-Old Child's Letter

　　The China Peace Committee in Defense of World Peace and Against US Aggression has received a letter of sympathy from Wang Yuan, a first-year junior high school student at Beijing Huiwen Middle School, to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. The full text is as follows:

　　Dear Volunteer Army Uncles:

　　I heard my mother say that you defeated the American devils in Korea and captured eight cities. I am very happy.

　　The American devils are very hateful. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, they bullied us Chinese people. After Japan surrendered, they helped Chiang Kai-shek kill the Chinese people. On June 25th, they helped Syngman Rhee kill the Korean people. America is a demon, even more ferocious than the Japanese devils. You went to Korea to fight and eliminate the enemies of the Chinese and Korean people, eliminating those American devils, and we are very happy. My teachers at school have said that America is a wolf. It is very ferocious and insidious. It is causing unrest in the lives of the Korean people in Korea. Volunteer Army Uncles, you are fighting wolves outside the door, to eliminate them, lest they come to China to cause harm, so that we can't even study.

　　You are going to Korea to fight wolves, for the sake of our neighbors and for the sake of the Chinese people. All the people of China and the world support you. You are invincible. We, the youth, raise our hands in unanimous support of you. You have done pioneer work for our safety and happiness.

　　Volunteer Army Uncles, are you cold? What do you want? Write to us! We are willing to donate our savings and pocket money to comfort you.

　　For a week, the school has been on vacation to do propaganda work. Today is Sunday. We went to various places this morning to do propaganda. The propaganda for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea makes everyone of one heart and one mind, a strong backing for you. This afternoon I rested and wrote you a letter to express my respect. I think that at this time, you are aiming at the American devils, offering them bullets!

　　Then, let those American devils eat more bullets, and let those demons go home sooner!

　　I am a fourteen-year-old girl. The year Japan surrendered, my mother and I were in Kunming and were bullied by American devils on the road. I will never forget this hatred. I think the Korean people have even deeper hatred than this! Please eliminate more American devils and avenge all those who have been humiliated.

　　Among the Chinese people, there are even deeper hatreds than ours, and in Korea there are even deeper hatreds than the Chinese people. This is why you went to Korea, and this is why we wrote you a letter of sympathy and the power of the world's people to resist US aggression and aid Korea.

　　We young people are thinking of going to the front lines to comfort you! Goodbye! Best wishes!

　　Wang Yuan, First-Year Junior High School Student, Beijing Huiwen Middle School

　　慰问中国人民援朝志愿军
    一个十四岁儿童的信
    中国保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会，接到了北京汇文中学初中一年级学生王元写给中国人民抗美援朝志愿部队的慰劳信。全文如下：志愿军伯伯：
    我听到妈妈说：你们在朝鲜打败了美国鬼子，拿下了八个城市，我很高兴。
    美国鬼子很可恶，在抗日战争的时候，他欺侮了我们中国人，日本投降以后，他帮蒋介石杀中国人民，六月二十五日又帮李承晚杀朝鲜人民。美国是魔鬼，比日本鬼子还凶。你们为着消灭中朝人民的敌人，到朝鲜去打仗，消灭那些美国鬼子，我们很快活。学校里的先生说过，美国是一只狼，他很凶残、阴险，它在朝鲜害得朝鲜的人民生活不得安宁。志愿军伯伯，你们在门外打狼，要消灭它们，免得它们来到中国祸害，使我们连读书也不行。
    你们到朝鲜去打狼，是为着我们的邻居，也为着中国的人民，全中国全世界的人民都拥护你们，你们是无敌的。我们少年，举起两手一致的拥护你们。你们为我们的安全、幸福，做了先锋的工作。
    志愿军伯伯，你们冷吗？想要什么？写信给我们吧，我们愿意捐出积蓄的零用钱来慰劳你们。
    一星期来，学校放假做宣传工作，今天是星期日，我们上午到各地去宣传。抗美援朝的宣传使大家一条心，做你们的后盾。下午我休息了，就写信给你，表示我的一点敬意。我想，这个时候，你们在瞄准美国鬼子，请他们吃子弹呢！
    那么，让那些美国鬼子吃更多的子弹吧，让那些魔鬼早点回老家去吧！
    我是十四岁的一个女孩，日本投降那年，我的妈妈和我在昆明，在路上受过美国鬼子的欺侮，这仇恨我永远忘不了，我想朝鲜的人民有比这还深的仇呢！请你们多消灭几个美国鬼子，为一切受侮辱的人们报仇。
    在中国人民中，有比我们更深的仇恨的，在朝鲜有比中国人民更深仇恨的，这就是你们为什么到朝鲜去，这就是为什么我们给你写慰劳信和全世界人民抗美援朝的力量了。
   我们少年想到前线慰劳你们呢？再见  祝好！
   北京汇文中学初中一年级学生  王元
