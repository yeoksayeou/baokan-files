The China Democratic League Headquarters' Winter Clothing Donation Committee previously launched a winter clothing donation campaign to aid disaster victims in northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, Hebei, and Henan. Over the past month, it has been met with enthusiastic responses and active donations from the League's members in Beijing and headquarters staff. A total of over seventy pieces of winter clothing of various sizes and 5,694,000 yuan (People's Currency) were collected and have been entirely delivered to the Beijing branch of the Disaster Relief Winter Clothing Donation Headquarters for transfer. The fundraising work at the headquarters has now been successfully completed.
