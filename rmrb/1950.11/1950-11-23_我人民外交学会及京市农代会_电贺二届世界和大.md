    [Report from this newspaper] The Chinese People's Diplomacy Association and the Beijing Municipal People's Congress of Agricultural Representatives, respectively, sent telegrams on the 22nd to congratulate the Second World Congress of Partisans of Peace.
    The congratulatory telegram from the Chinese People's Diplomacy Association stated: At a time when American imperialism is expanding its war of aggression in Korea, undermining the United Nations, and deliberately invading the Far East and threatening world peace, the convening of the congress will surely make a significant contribution to stopping aggression and defending world peace. We warmly congratulate the success of the congress and are willing to join hands with the peace-loving people of the Soviet Union, Poland, North Korea, Vietnam, Mongolia, Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and all other countries to strive to achieve the congress's goal of defending peace.
    The Beijing Municipal People's Congress of Agricultural Representatives, representing the farmers of suburban Beijing, expressed its highest respect to the Second World Congress of Partisans of Peace and declared in its congratulatory telegram: We recognize that China's security is inseparable from world peace, and we have signed the Stockholm Appeal for Peace. We pledge to be the backing of the congress, abide by all resolutions of the congress, and strive to defend the peace of the world and mankind, and to oppose the aggression of American imperialism.
