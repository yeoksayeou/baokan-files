Xinhua News Agency, 4th: In order to coordinate with America's aggression in the Far East, MacArthur is actively directing traitorous and spy elements to carry out sabotage activities against New China. Regarding the so-called Third Force's activities to undermine New China, it is reported that MacArthur has already gathered a group of traitorous and spy elements, including primarily the Cantonese bandit Zhang Fakui, the traitors Ren Yuandao, Yang Zhonghua, Han Yunjie, Sun Baogang and Luo Jianbai of the Democratic Socialist Party, and Li Huang, Zeng Qi, and Zhao Yusong of the Youth Party. Under the instigation of the American imperialists, they are inciting anti-Soviet and anti-communist sentiment, sowing discord in Sino-Soviet relations, and actively engaging in sabotage against New China, even shouting "anti-Chiang" slogans in an attempt to deceive the public. The main sabotage activities that these bandits are currently carrying out against New China include:

　　(1) Engaging in banditry. It is reported that MacArthur has appointed the Zhang bandit Fakui and the Yang bandit Zhonghua as the so-called "Commander-in-Chief of South China" and "Commander-in-Chief of East China," ordering them to command a small number of bandits hiding in the South China and East China regions to engage in murder, arson, and disruption of public order. Those conspiring with the Yang bandit include the Gu bandit Xiwu, the Liu bandit Mai, etc.

　　(2) Training spies and collecting intelligence. The Zhang bandit Fakui has colluded with the Sun bandit Baogang to engage in underground activities in the South China region. The Yang bandit Zhonghua has been training spies in Yokosuka, Japan, in order to send them to mainland China as spies.

　　(3) Counterfeiting Renminbi to disrupt our country's finances. In order to raise funds for the so-called "Third Force" activities, the bandit Youth Party has decided, with MacArthur's support, to cooperate with Japanese spies to counterfeit fake Renminbi, and then smuggle it into our country through Hong Kong, in order to disrupt our country's finances.

　　美帝搜罗汉奸特务
    对新中国进行破坏活动
    【新华社四日讯】为了配合美国在远东的侵略，麦克阿瑟正积极指挥汉奸特务分子对新中国进行破坏活动。所谓第三种势力的破坏新中国的活动，据悉：麦魔已搜罗到的一批汉奸特务分子，主要有粤匪张发奎、汉奸任援道、杨仲华、韩云阶，民社党之孙宝刚、罗坚白，青年党之李璜、曾琦、赵毓松等。他们在美帝授意下，煽动反苏反共，挑拨中苏关系，并积极进行对新中国的破坏，甚至喊出“反蒋”的口号，以图迷惑听闻。这群匪徒目前对新中国所进行的主要破坏活动包括：
    （一）进行土匪活动。据息：麦克阿瑟已委派张匪发奎和杨匪仲华二人为所谓“华南总司令”和“华东总司令”，命令他们指挥潜在华南和华东地区的少数土匪从事杀人放火，扰乱治安。与杨匪合谋者尚有顾匪秀五、刘匪迈等。
    （二）训练特务，搜集情报。张匪发奎已勾结孙匪宝刚从事华南地区的地下活动。杨匪仲华已在日本横须贺训练特务，以便将他们派到中国大陆充当间谍。
    （三）伪造人民币捣乱我国金融。匪青年党为筹措所谓“第三种势力”活动的经费，已决定在麦克阿瑟支持下，与日本特务合作，伪造假人民币，然后经香港偷运我国，借以扰乱我国金融。
