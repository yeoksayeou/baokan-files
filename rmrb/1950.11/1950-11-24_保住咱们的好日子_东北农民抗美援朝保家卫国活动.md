Safeguarding Our Good Life
    --Northeast Farmers' Activities to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend the Homeland

    The American imperialists' criminal acts of aggression against Korea and our country have aroused extreme anger among the farmers of Northeast China. They have spontaneously organized stretcher teams and enthusiastically paid public grain to support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in order to safeguard their good times.

    The farmers of Northeast China know how Japanese imperialism crossed the Yalu River twenty years ago, colluded with local bullies and landlords, seized their fields and houses, and forced them to live like beasts of burden as slaves without a country. Zhu Shiqing, a 72-year-old farmer in Fengjia Village, Andong County, Liaodong Province, could not bear to see his children and grandchildren become beasts of burden again. He earnestly warned his son, "In the Jiawu year, the Japanese devils occupied Korea, and then they occupied our Northeast. The Americans are trying to follow the same path. You should use whatever ability you have to help the Korean people win the war on the east side of the river (i.e., the east bank of the Yalu River) and safeguard our good life!"

    "Safeguarding our good life" has become the heartfelt voice of millions of liberated farmers and the source of their strength to resist America and aid Korea. Qi Yucai of Liuhe Village, Sixth District, Suihua County, Heilongjiang Province, had already prepared good grain to hand over as public grain and volunteered to go to Korea for logistical support. During the puppet Manchukuo period, he and his father worked for the traitorous landlords Ji Weisan and Wang Dezhen. They had to leave home at the crack of dawn and didn't return until dark. They were fined for any missed workdays, and they were never able to eat their fill or keep warm. They lived in open-air houses and were always worried about being forced to move. When he was working for the landlord Wang Dezhen, he was suffering from typhoid fever. He was forced to work before he had recovered, which caused him to develop leg pain that he still suffers from. Thinking back on the past suffering, there is no end to the tales. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the poor people were liberated. Qi Yucai was allocated more than eleven *qiang* of land, three houses, and a large horse. He formed a mutual aid group with others, and his whole family, men and women, old and young, worked hard. Production has been very good in recent years. He bought five large and small livestock and a cart. This year, including the rented land, he cultivated more than sixteen *qiang*. The harvest was also good, yielding more than seventy-five *shi* of grain. Life has been very good. Cotton clothes were put on long ago, and new quilts were made. They live in a three-room house with glass windows, raise six pigs and more than twenty chickens, and have invested five shares in the cooperative. His whole family has been functionally illiterate for generations, but now two of his children are attending school. However, he heard that American imperialism is arming and invading Korea and that our national defense has been threatened. The American imperialists are not letting our people live a good life. He said, "We cannot let American imperialism enter China's gate. I volunteer to go to Korea as a stretcher bearer to help the Korean people fight, defend the security of the motherland, and defend our free and happy good life."

    Farmers like Qi Yucai are appearing everywhere in Northeast China. Zhang Kundong, a farmer in Fengcheng County, Liaodong Province, worked for landlords for half his life during the puppet Manchukuo period and suffered from hunger and cold for half his life. During the land reform, he was allocated ten *mu* of land. He worked diligently on his own land, and his life improved year by year. Over the years, he bought three head of livestock, and this year he bought another fifteen *mu* of land. However, when he heard American planes strafing Linjiang and looked at the lively livestock in the cowshed, he felt that if the American imperialists were not driven out of Korea, a good life could not be maintained. So, he went to find Shi Yulin, a partner who had carried stretchers together during the Liaoshen Campaign and made great contributions together. He said, "Old Shi, the American devils are at our door. We can't just stand by and watch them commit atrocities! I really want to pack up my stretcher and go to Korea, first to defend ourselves and second so that the Korean people can be liberated sooner." Shi Yulin, like Zhang Kundong, had long hated the American imperialists. He immediately replied, "I was just thinking of discussing it with you!" Now, farmers in the counties at the foot of Changbai Mountain alone have spontaneously organized more than 4,200 stretchers, ready to cross the river at any time to support the Korean people.

    Under the high spirit of patriotism and internationalism, in addition to volunteering to go to Korea for logistical support, the vast areas of Northeast China are launching a surge of paying good public grain to support the volunteer troops. Cui De, a model worker from Xincun Village, Fifth District, Acheng County, Songjiang Province, said, "Our grain is bullets. We guarantee to pay good public grain to support the volunteer army and drive the invaders out of Korea!" The farmers of Xinxing Village, Fifth District, Shuangcheng County, paid attention to the important task of preparing public grain from the beginning of threshing. Everyone knows that soybeans are very useful to the country, so they rushed to pull and thresh soybeans first, fearing that they would be affected by rain and snow if left behind, or that they would not be cleaned up properly if they were caught in the frozen fields. Therefore, the soybeans for public grain were all threshed out before the land had been completely harvested. However, the district's notice to requisition sorghum came down first. The whole village rushed to thresh sorghum overnight. The Fan Xizheng mutual aid group pulled back three carts of sorghum heads overnight, using the moonlight. Without resting, they threshed until dawn. The next day, every household, men and women, was busy using windmills, sieves, and winnowing pans. The villagers coming and going on the street asked each other about the progress of the public grain. Everyone was unwilling to lag behind. In less than two days, the entire village had prepared the sorghum to be handed over. Then, they mobilized all the carts in the village and finished delivering the first batch of public grain overnight.

　　保住咱们的好日子
    ——东北农民抗美援朝保家卫国活动
    美帝侵略朝鲜和我国的罪恶行为，引起了东北农民的极端愤怒。他们纷纷自动组织担架队，踊跃缴纳公粮，支援朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队，以保住自己的好时光。
    东北农民知道，二十年前日本帝国主义是怎样跨过鸭绿江，和恶霸地主勾结，侵占了他们的田地和房屋，迫使他们过着牛马般的亡国奴生活。辽东省安东县冯家村的一位七十二岁的老农祝世清，不忍看自己的子孙再当牛马，谆谆告诫他的儿子说：“甲午年日本鬼子占了朝鲜，接着就占咱东北；美国又要走那条道了。你应该有什么能力使什么能力，到江东（即鸭绿江东岸）帮助朝鲜人民打胜仗，保住咱们的好日子！”
    “保住咱们的好日子”已成为千万翻身农民的心声，已成为他们抗美援朝的力量的源泉。黑龙江绥化县六区六合村祁玉才，已经准备了好的粮食交公粮，并志愿到朝鲜出战勤。伪满时，他和父亲给汉奸大地主纪维三和王德珍扛活。每天鸡叫就出门，天黑了才回来，一误工就扣钱，年年吃不饱穿不暖，住在露天房子里，年年还耽心叫搬家。给大地主王德珍扛活时，他正患伤寒病，没等好就叫干活，使他得了腿痛病，直到现在还没好。想起过去的苦难，真是说不完。共产党领导穷人翻了身，祁玉才分得了十一垧多地，三间房子，一匹大马。他和别人联组，全家男女老少都努力劳动，这几年生产搞得很好，买了大、小五个牲口，一台车。今年连租进的地种了十六垧多，年头又不错，共打七十五石多粮，生活过得很好。棉衣服早就穿上了，也有了新被，住着三间玻璃窗户的房子，养着六口猪，二十多只小鸡，合作社还入了五股。全家当了好几辈子的瞪眼瞎子，现在也有两个孩子上学校念书了。但是，他听到了美帝国主义正在武装侵略朝鲜，我国国防已经遭受威胁，美帝不让我们人民过好日子，他说：“我们不能让美帝国主义进中国的大门，我志愿出担架到朝鲜去，帮助朝鲜人民作战，保卫祖国安全，保卫自由幸福的好日子。”
    像祁玉才那样的农民，在东北到处出现。辽东省凤城县农民张坤栋，伪满时，给地主扛了半辈子活，也挨饿受冻了半辈子。土改时，他分得十亩地。在自己的土地上，辛勤地劳动，日子一年比一年过得好了。几年来，他买了三头牲口，今年又买了十五亩地。可是，当他听到美帝飞机在临江扫射，再看看牛圈里活蹦蹦的牲口时，觉得不把美帝逐出朝鲜，好日子是保不住了。于是，他就去找辽沈战役时一同抬过担架，共同立过大功的伙伴时玉林。他说：“老时，美国鬼子打到咱们门口了，咱们不能瞪着眼叫他行凶啊！我真想收拾起担架到朝鲜去，一来保卫咱们自己，二来朝鲜人民也能早些解放。”时玉林也和张坤栋一样，早已恨透美帝。他马上回答说：“我正想找你核计呢！”现在，仅长白山麓各县的农民，已自动组织了四千二百余付担架，准备随时过江支援朝鲜人民。
    在高度的爱国主义与国际主义精神下，东北农民除了志愿赴朝出战勤外，广大地区正在展开缴好公粮以支援志愿部队的热潮。松江省阿城县第五区新乡村劳模崔德说：“我们的粮食就是子弹，保证交好公粮，支援志愿军，把侵略者赶出朝鲜去！”双城县五区新兴村农民，开始打场时就留心了准备公粮这件大事。大家知道大豆对国家用处大，抢着先拉、打大豆，恐怕留在后头下雨雪受潮，或者赶上打冻场收拾得不干净。所以，地还没拉完，送公粮用的黄豆就都打出来了。可是，区上征借高粱的通知先下来了。全村都连夜赶着打高粱。范喜政互助组连夜趁月光拉回三车高粱头，人马没闲，一直打到天亮。第二天家家户户，男男女女又忙着用风车风，筛子筛，簸箕簸。街上来往的老乡，一见面都互相询问公粮收拾得怎么样？大家都不甘落后。全村不到两天功夫，就把应交的高粱都准备好了。接着，出动全村所有的大车，连夜送完了第一批公粮。
