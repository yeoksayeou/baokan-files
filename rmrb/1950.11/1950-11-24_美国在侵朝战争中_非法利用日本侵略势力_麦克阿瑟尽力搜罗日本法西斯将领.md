Xinhua News Agency, 23rd dispatch: The American imperialists are blatantly and illegally using the Japanese aggressive forces and Japanese manpower and materials it fostered to carry out the war of aggression against Korea. After launching the war of aggression against Korea, MacArthur immediately mobilized Japanese ships and Japanese sailors familiar with Korean territorial waters to transport American invading troops and supplies to South Korea. MacArthur also appointed former Japanese Navy Lieutenant General Minoru Maeda as an advisor to the American fleet carrying out the blockade of the Korean coast. The "Maritime Safety Agency" vessels of the Yoshida government were also mobilized to patrol and sweep mines for the American invaders in Korean territorial waters. One of the minesweepers was sunk by a magnetic mine off Wonsan Port on October 18.

The United States also collected Japanese fascist soldiers and sent them to fight in Korea. Japanese soldiers participated in battles in areas such as Suwon, Seoul, and Cheorwon. There were also many Japanese in the Rhee Syngman puppet army's 7th and 8th divisions. Among the former Japanese officers fighting in Korea under American command, many were war criminals who had engaged in wars of aggression against China during the war, including Major General Michitake Yamaoka, former Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army in Taiyuan, Shanxi, and Lieutenant General Akio Doi, commander of the Japanese Taiwan Army during the war.

At the same time, the United States plundered Japanese materials and exploited Japanese labor to engage in the war of aggression against Korea. The Japanese war industry, illegally retained and supported by the United States after the war, is working day and night to produce for American military orders. According to materials released by the Yoshida government's Economic Stabilization Board based on a survey by MacArthur's headquarters, from the outbreak of the Korean War to November 5, the total value of military procurement contracts signed by the US military and Japan amounted to more than 139.67 million US dollars. Among them, the ordered materials were more than 87.3 million US dollars, and the labor services such as repair, processing, transportation, and construction were more than 52.37 million US dollars. Military supplies produced by Japanese factories for the US military include locomotives, trucks, steel, sacks, cement, medicines, and other items.

According to a report in the Japanese "Toyo Keizai Shinpo" on October 14, as of September 14, approximately 143,000 Japanese workers were working for the US military. The US military not only conscripted Japanese workers in Japan, but also used despicable methods of coercion and inducement to forcibly recruit them to work in Korea.

TASS, 22nd dispatch citing the Japanese newspaper "Peace and Independence": An organization called "Kato" has long been engaged in activities in Japan. Many of the former Japanese Army and Navy generals currently serving at MacArthur's headquarters have joined this organization. For example, former Japanese Army Lieutenant General Kamata, Arisue, Army Major General Tanaka and others. It is rumored that this organization has established contact with Willoughby, the head of the intelligence group at MacArthur's headquarters, and has organized a 20,000-strong "Japanese Expeditionary Force" on his orders. In addition, this organization fully controls all personnel issues related to the Japanese "Police Reserve Force".

Another organization calling itself the "War History Research Society" also includes senior officers from the former Japanese Army and Navy. This "society", which is closely linked to MacArthur's headquarters, is reportedly drafting operational plans for an anti-Soviet war. The archives and "combat experience" of the former Japanese Army are being used to achieve this goal. It is also rumored that members of this "society" participated in formulating the US military's plans for the Korean War and specifically participated in formulating the US military's plans for the Incheon landing.

　　美国在侵朝战争中
    非法利用日本侵略势力
    麦克阿瑟尽力搜罗日本法西斯将领
    【新华社二十三日讯】美帝国主义者明目张胆地非法利用它一手扶植的日本侵略势力及日本的人力与物力，进行侵略朝鲜的战争。麦克阿瑟在发动侵朝战争以后，立即动员日本船只及熟悉朝鲜领海的日本水手，将美国侵略军及供应品运往南朝鲜。麦克阿瑟并任命前日本海军中将前田实为执行封锁朝鲜海岸的美国舰队的顾问。吉田政府“海上保安厅”的舰艇也被动员起来，在朝鲜领海为美国侵略者从事巡逻和扫海。其中的一艘扫雷艇，已于十月十八日在元山港外被磁性水雷炸沉。
    美国并搜罗日本法西斯军人，派往朝鲜作战。在水原、汉城、铁原等地区的战斗中，都有日本军人参加。李承晚伪军第七师和第八师中，也有许多日本人。在美国指挥下在朝鲜作战的前日本军官，其中有不少是战时曾经从事侵略中国的战争罪犯，其中包括前驻山西太原日军参谋长山冈道武少将及战时日本台湾方面军司令土居明夫中将等。
    美国同时搜括日本物资和榨取日本劳动力，从事侵朝战争。战后为美国非法保留和扶植的日本战争工业，正为美国军事订货日夜生产。据吉田政府经济安定本部根据麦克阿瑟总部的调查所发表的材料，自朝鲜战争爆发起，至十一月五日止，美军与日本所签订的军需合同，总额达一亿三千九百六十七万余美元。其中订购物资为八千七百三十万余美元，修理、加工、运输、建筑等劳务为五千二百三十七万余美元。日本工厂为美军生产的军用物资，包括机车、卡车、钢铁、麻袋、水泥、药品等物。
    据日本《东洋经济新报》十月十四日透露，截至九月十四日为止，约有十四万三千名日本工人在为美国军队工作。美军不仅在日本国内征用日本工人，并且用威迫利诱的卑鄙手段，强迫征募他们到朝鲜去工作。
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社二十二日电引日本报纸《和平与独立》消息：一个名为“加藤”的组织，久已在日本从事活动。目前在麦克阿瑟总部服务的前日本陆军与海军将领们中间，有许多人加入了这个组织。例如，前日本陆军中将镰田与有末以及陆军少将田中及其他人等。据传这个组织已与麦克阿瑟总部谍报组组长威洛贝建立联系，并奉他的命令组织了两万人的“日本远征队”。此外，这个组织还充分控制了关于日本“警察后备队”人事上的一切问题。
    另一个自称为“战史研究学社”的组织，也包括有前日本海陆军的高级军官。这个与麦克阿瑟总部密切联系的“学社”，据传正在拟定反苏战争的作战计划。前日本陆军的档案与“战斗经验”，都被利用来达到这个目的。又据传这一“学社”的社员们曾参与厘订美军在朝鲜作战的计划，并具体地参与厘订美军在仁川登陆的计划。
