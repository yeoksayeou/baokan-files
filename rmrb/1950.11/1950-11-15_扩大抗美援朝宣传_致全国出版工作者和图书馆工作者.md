　　Expanding the Campaign to Resist America and Aid Korea
　  ——To All Publishing and Library Workers

    American imperialism launched a war of aggression against Korea, using its navy and air force to invade our territorial waters and airspace, and attempting to invade our northeastern territory from Korea, thus arousing the anger of the Chinese people. Our people have spontaneously launched a movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation, and have organized volunteer troops to go to Korea to participate in the Korean People's Army's operations. The democratic parties of our country solemnly issued a joint declaration, "vowing to fully support the just demands of the people of the whole country, and to support the struggle of the people of the whole country on a voluntary basis for the sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes and defending the country." The greedy and brutal American imperialists are invading Korea and China, just like the Japanese imperialists in the past. Their狂暴 behavior will not stop immediately until they are badly defeated. Resisting America and aiding Korea is an arduous struggle, and all of us Chinese people should do our best to carry out this struggle. We put forward the following suggestions to publishing and library workers across the country:

    1. We suggest that publishers contact writers to compile and print more books and periodicals related to resisting America and aiding Korea. Both advanced theoretical specialized works and various popular readings are needed. Popular readings are especially important. In terms of content, there are very wide range of areas, such as exposing the historical facts of American imperialist aggression against China, exposing the atrocities of American imperialism, analyzing the situation of the enemy and ourselves, introducing the situation in Korea, depicting the heroic patriotic deeds of our country and the Soviet people, and introducing general military knowledge. In terms of form, comic strips, New Year pictures, novels, stories, poems, ballads, dramas, speeches, and reports can all be used. In terms of target audience, general intellectuals, workers, peasants, and soldiers, housewives, teenagers, and children, each different target group has more or less their own special situations and requirements, and we should all satisfy them. Our publications should use a variety of content and forms to specifically and vividly meet the requirements of each specific target audience, so that they will love to read them, and after reading them, they can be enlightened and solve the problems that exist in their minds. In addition, various journals of different nature can be linked to current affairs issues to expand the influence of propaganda.

    2. We suggest that comrades engaged in distribution work across the country use a variety of ways to promote all excellent readings directly or indirectly related to resisting America and aiding Korea. Recently, the Sanlian Bookstore Distribution Department in Beijing has specially set up a book counter for books and periodicals related to current affairs issues, concentrated them for readers to choose from, and used colored advertising paintings to introduce newly published excellent current affairs readings. This is a very good method. There are many other things that can be done, such as compiling and printing catalogs of current affairs readings and sending them to readers in various places, organizing mobile supply teams to sell books in schools, factories, markets, and troops, and setting up book kiosks in public places such as parks and railway stations to sell current affairs readings. These are all methods worth adopting.

    3. We suggest that library workers across the country—including public and private libraries, reading rooms, reading rooms in schools, factories, government agencies, and organizations, cultural palaces, clubs, and data rooms—should use various methods to encourage readers to read newspapers, periodicals, and various current affairs readings. For example, holding exhibitions and lectures, specially arranging reading rooms, organizing reading groups, providing special convenience to those who borrow current affairs readings, and organizing mobile reading teams are all relatively easy to do. The National Beijing Library has been regularly holding exhibitions in connection with current affairs for more than a year, which should be commended.

    The above are our suggestions to publishing workers and library workers across the country. Our general readers should not give up the task of publicizing the campaign to resist America and aid Korea. For example, passing on the newspapers and books that you have bought and read to relatives and friends who lack books is an easy propaganda task.

    Marx said, "Once theory is grasped by the masses, it immediately becomes a material force." This sentence briefly and powerfully indicates the great significance of propaganda work. In the current great movement to resist America and aid Korea, our publishing workers, library workers, and general readers should all stand on their respective posts, work hard to do a good job in propaganda, and jointly complete the sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending the country!

　　扩大抗美援朝宣传
　  ——致全国出版工作者和图书馆工作者
　　编者
    美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜战争，用海、空军侵入我领海、领空，并妄图从朝鲜进犯我东北领土，因而激起了我国人民的愤怒。我国人民自动发起抗美援朝保家卫国的运动，并已组织了志愿军赴朝参加朝鲜人民军作战。我国各民主党派郑重发布联合宣言，“誓以全力拥护全国人民的正义要求，拥护全国人民在志愿基础上为着抗美援朝、保家卫国的神圣任务而奋斗。”贪婪残暴的美帝国主义侵略朝鲜和中国，和过去日本帝国主义一模一样，在没有碰得头破血流以前，它的狂暴行为是不会马上就停止的。抗美援朝是个艰巨的斗争，我们全中国人民应该竭全力来进行这个斗争。我们向全国出版工作者和图书馆工作者提出如下的建议：
    一、建议出版家联系著作家多多编印有关抗美援朝的书刊，高级的理论性的专门著作和各种通俗读物都很需要。通俗读物尤其重要。就内容说，如揭发美帝侵华史实，暴露美帝暴行，分析敌我形势，介绍朝鲜情况，描绘我国及苏联人民英勇的爱国事迹，介绍一般军事常识等，方面是非常广泛的。就形式说，连环图画、年画、小说、故事、诗歌、曲艺、戏剧、讲演、报告，都可以采用。就读者对象说，一般知识分子、工农兵大众、家庭妇女、少年、儿童，每一种不同的对象，多多少少都有他们特殊的情况和要求，我们都应该使他们得到满足。我们的出版物，应该用多种多样的内容和形式，具体而生动地去适合各个特定读者对象的要求，使他们爱读，读了之后能够有所启发，能够解决他们思想上存在着的问题。此外，各种不同性质的期刊，都可以联系到当前的时事问题，借以扩大宣传的影响。
    二、建议全国从事发行工作的同志们，用多种多样的方式来推广一切直接间接有关抗美援朝的优良读物。最近北京三联书店发行所门市部，把有关时事问题的书刊，特别设置书柜，集中陈列起来，供读者去选购；并用彩色广告画，介绍新出版的优良时事读物，这就是一种很好的方式。其他可以做的工作是很多的，如编印时事读物目录寄发各地读者，组织流动供应队到学校、工厂、市集、军队里去卖书，在公园、火车站等公共场所设置书亭发售时事读物，都是值得采用的方式。
    三、建议全国图书馆工作者——包括公私立图书馆、阅览室，学校、工厂、机关、团体中的阅览室、文化宫、俱乐部、资料室的工作同志们，应采用种种方式鼓动读者阅读报纸、期刊和各种时事读物。例如举行展览会、演讲会，特别布置阅览室，组织读书小组，予借阅时事读物者以特殊便利，举办巡回阅览队等都是比较容易做到的。图书馆联系时事举办展览会的工作，最近一年多来，国立北京图书馆经常在做，这是应当受到表扬的。
    以上是我们向全国出版工作者、图书馆工作者的几点建议。我们的一般读者也不应该放弃抗美援朝宣传的任务。例如把自己买来看过了的报纸、书刊转送给缺乏书刊的亲友，就是一种轻而易举的宣传工作。
    马克思说，“理论一掌握了群众，便立刻成为物质的力量。”这一句话，简短而有力地指示出宣传工作的意义的重大。在当前抗美援朝的伟大运动中，我们的出版工作者、图书馆工作者和一般读者们，都应该各自站在自己的岗位上，努力做好宣传工作，共同来完成抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务！
