　　A Perspective on American Military Strength
　　Tan Wenrui
    American imperialists are intensifying their plans to launch new wars of aggression in an attempt to establish world hegemony. The warmongers originally thought that global adventures of aggression could achieve cheap victories by relying on destructive weapons. The development of the Korean War has taught them a serious lesson. The stakes the American aggressors have placed in Korea are getting higher and higher, and their feet are sinking deeper and deeper into the mud.
    Everyone knows that large-scale modern warfare must rely on strong armed forces that are good at applying weapons and technology. As for the naive argument that atomic bombs alone can win a war, it is now even despised and criticized by American military figures. They believe that the impact of the atomic bomb on some principles of modern warfare will not be greater than at the time of the invention of gunpowder, poison gas, tanks, and airplanes. American "liberal" military commentator Werner said: "The total military strength of a country cannot exceed its total actual combat power. If there are not enough soldiers and combat troops to use the available military weapons and machinery, then the unused available mechanical equipment must be written off as military surplus." He pointed out that the main deficiency of the United States is "the lack of a trained and organized fighting force." When the United States wanted to transfer more troops to expand the war of aggression in Korea, the newly appointed US Secretary of Defense Marshall also admitted that the United States lacked a trained reserve force. He anxiously said, "To replenish the troops fighting in Korea, the American army must be deployed now."
    At the beginning of launching the armed aggression against the Korean War, the United States invested five incomplete divisions, about seventy to eighty thousand people, in Korea. Later, it successively increased its troops. In mid-September, it frantically mobilized more than 40,000 of its remaining troops from the sea, land, and air forces in the Far East, and MacArthur personally directed the landing at Incheon. As a result, the U.S. invasion army increased to seven divisions and one regiment, totaling more than 140,000 people. In order to replenish the troops in the Far East, an infantry division originally stationed in the United States was also transferred abroad. Therefore, the ground combat troops still remaining in the United States were only one airborne division and one Marine division, about 30,000 people. At the beginning of the United States' armed aggression plan, it revealed the embarrassment of being "stretched thin."
    How many troops does the American imperialism, which is dreaming of ruling the world, actually have? According to the official figures published by the New York Times in May 1950, the total strength of the U.S. regular forces was 1,458,400, including 596,000 in the Army, 454,400 in the Navy, and 408,000 in the Air Force. That is to say, on the eve of launching the war of aggression against Korea, the total number of armed forces in the United States was about 1.45 million to 1.5 million. In addition, there are 2.5 million reserves. For the United States in peacetime, such a number can be said to be the largest. In 1935, the U.S. armed forces were only more than 230,000. In 1940, one year before the United States joined the war against Japan, there were only about 410,000. The number of armed forces now in the United States has increased by three and a half to six times compared with a few years before the Second World War.
    It should be pointed out here that the 1.45 million regular troops in the United States include a large number of non-combatants. For example, in the 600,000 U.S. Army, there are 446,000 non-combatants, and the actual combat strength is less than 160,000. Moreover, the U.S. military is scattered all over the world. Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Johnson said in his military report to Truman this April: "All U.S. troops stationed overseas account for more than 40 percent of the armed forces of the three services, nearly 600,000." Of the 600,000 U.S. Army troops, 270,000 are used to maintain the long-term occupation of Japan and West Germany. In addition, there are U.S. troops stationed in Austria, Trieste, the Philippines, Greece, and other places where American influence reaches. Most of the U.S. Navy and Air Force are also stationed at more than 400 U.S. military bases overseas. The dispersion of forces makes hundreds of thousands of troops even less useful.
    The main reason why the United States did not expand its armed forces to a larger number earlier is that the U.S. military authorities are obsessed with the power of atomic weapons and "strategic air force," and at the same time feel that the U.S. manpower is limited.
    Since June this year, Truman has taken various conscription and mobilization measures under the pretext of the Korean War. On October 7, according to the Conscription Act passed by the U.S. Congress in June 1948, he ordered conscription, "registering all men aged 18 to 25 for conscription at any time the president deems it necessary." In late October, he signed a bill extending the current term of service by one year for 300,000 people whose terms of service will expire in the next twelve months. At the same time, the Department of Defense announced the start of conscription of reservists. Truman has announced his plan to increase the number of active-duty Navy, Army, and Air Force personnel from 1.5 million to 3 million. It has now begun to conscript more than 200,000 reservists, and is preparing to conscript 260,000 new recruits by the end of this year. In early November, the director of the U.S. Selective Service System, Hershey, stated that, according to the current conscription regulations, "the United States cannot produce and maintain a military establishment of 3 million people." To increase the armed forces to 3 million, further mobilization measures must be taken. But in reality, the initial conscription of only unmarried men aged 24 to 25 has been frustrated. Many conscripted youths did not report, and 40 percent of those who reported did not meet the physical standards. If veterans, freelancers, and married men are further conscripted, it will inevitably be more difficult. The United States often boasts that it has 8 million veterans. In fact, most of the veterans who enlisted in 1941 or 1942 are now over 30 years old, and some are over 40 years old. An army composed of them will not be "young master soldiers" but "old master soldiers." At the same time, most veterans are unwilling to put on their military uniforms again. Many of them even believe that they were fooled when they went to the front line to fight in the last war and let others get rich in the rear. They know that the future war will no longer be as cheap as the last war. If the chance of dying in the last war was 10 percent, this time it will be 90 percent. The most common slogan in the advertisements used by the American rulers to deceive people into joining the army is "Join the army, travel the world," and a saying popular among the American people today is "Join the army, travel to another world (death)." Today, not many people in the United States are willing to be cannon fodder for the interests of Wall Street.
    Of course, the American ruling class, which is obsessed with military adventure plans, may use coercive means to force the American people to enlist, regardless of everything. But according to the statistics of the U.S. government, out of its 140 million population, only 66 million men and women have labor power, and the United States' normal industrial production and transportation work need 60 million employed workers to maintain. The manpower required for expanded wartime production will naturally be even greater. In World War II, the U.S. government spent its greatest efforts to mobilize 11 million soldiers (including women), which had a great impact on the U.S. wartime economy. It is very difficult for the United States to mobilize the same number of soldiers to conduct a new war.
    Even if the U.S. ruling group uses all kinds of threats and inducements to gather 3 million troops by the end of next year, it will not be enough to undertake a world-scale war of aggression plan. According to the plan of the U.S. Department of the Army, the Army only accounts for 1.3 million of the 3 million armed forces, and the actual combat ground forces are only 500,000 to 600,000. Let us review the history of World War II. The total number of armed forces invested in combat by both the Allied and Axis powers reached 93 million, and the number of troops mobilized by the Soviet Union alone was 22 million. Germany used 17 million troops in Europe to launch an aggression, and Japan's invasion army in Asia also exceeded 6 million, but it was finally defeated by the Soviet Union and China. Moreover, in World War II, the consumption of soldiers was also amazing. From the time Hitler's Wehrmacht and stormtroopers attacked Poland to the time Admiral Dönitz announced unconditional surrender, Germany lost nearly 10 million troops in total (only casualties). If the United States can only have hundreds of thousands of ground combat troops, is this not too inconsistent with its aggressive adventure plan to conquer the world? At present, the war in Korea—a country with only 30 million people—has absorbed hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops, which is almost 60 percent of the current total combat force of the United States. Hundreds of thousands of troops are not enough to fight a battle like the German invasion of Stalingrad. Looking back at World War II, the more than 700,000 Kwantung Army stationed in Northeast China by Japan was wiped out by the Soviet Red Army in less than half a month.
    One of the wishful thinking of the United States to remedy its lack of manpower is to drive the people of Western European countries to be cannon fodder for it. The American imperialists have long put forward the argument that "the United States provides money and weapons, and European countries provide manpower," or "the United States provides strategic air force," Britain provides "tactical air force" and navy, and France provides "army," and so on. And use the "North Atlantic Treaty" to gather the vassal states of Western Europe to organize a so-called "collective" invasion force. This plan has been brewing for a long time. Due to the continuous pressure from the United States, according to the communiqué issued by the so-called military committee meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's aggressive group, Western European countries have agreed to "establish a unified command of the joint army as soon as possible," but according to the United Press report, the issue of whether, when, and how to establish a "European army" will still be hotly debated. On the one hand, the rulers of the vassal states are afraid of the people's opposition and cannot but have some concerns. On the other hand, the main countries such as Britain, France, and the Netherlands have their own hidden worries: the heroic fighting of the Vietnamese People's Army has exhausted France; the British colonists want to suppress the Malayan People's Liberation Struggle, and more than 100,000 troops have been dispatched, but it is still to no avail; the Netherlands is worried about the resurgence of the Indonesian people's power. The military power is still tied down in Indonesia. After the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea under the name of the United Nations, it forced the vassal states to contribute tens of thousands of troops under great pressure. However, these accomplices had to feel "deep anxiety" about the future of the war. French Defense Minister Mock recently talked about the difficulties of Western European countries sending troops. He said that even with the US$3 billion in aid from the United States, France's military strength cannot exceed ten divisions by 1951, and can only increase to fifteen divisions by 1952, and can only increase to twenty-five divisions by 1953. France currently has only five divisions of armed forces. And the combat effectiveness of these troops is weaker than that of the French army that abandoned the Maginot Line in 1940. But the French army is regarded as the core of the Western European collective invasion army. No wonder Werner said that such a plan is "either an unforgivable strategic mistake or a farce." As for Britain, there are about 300,000 troops stationed in mainland Britain and West Germany, and more than 300,000 troops stationed in the colonies, but Britain's actual combat strength will not be much stronger than that of France. According to London officials, the following mobilization order can only form ten divisions of regular troops. As for the military strength of countries such as Norway and Denmark, it is probably only enough to protect their own airports. In short, at present, Western European countries cannot transfer 20 divisions of troops, and according to the strategists of the Anglo-American group, "defending the Elbe requires 50 to 60 divisions." If an offensive is to be launched in Europe, then 80 to 100 divisions of troops are necessary. Where will the United States get so many "allies"?
    The American imperialists finally stooped to begging the remnants of the fascist bandits in a vile and shameless manner. It openly attempts to rebuild the military strength of Germany and Japan, and uses Hitler's Nazi army and Japan's "Imperial Army" as the vanguard of its aggressive army. However, this conspiracy is not only difficult to achieve because of the contradictions existing within the imperialist group; and is being strongly opposed by the people of the world. The solemn statement of the eight foreign ministers of the Soviet Union and Germany protesting the rearmament of Germany and the just accusation of the Soviet Union condemning the United States for using the Japanese army to carry out aggression have won the support of the broad masses of the people. More importantly, the people of Germany and Japan today have greatly awakened and will no longer be willing to be cannon fodder for the aggressors. Moreover, the military systems of Germany and Japan were basically destroyed in the Second World War. It can be said that it is impossible to form an army like the Nazi army or the "Imperial Army" of that year again.
    The United States not only does not have enough soldiers, but the army that can be formed is also low in morale and cannot fight. The cowardice and weakness of the U.S. invasion army have been fully exposed in the war in Korea, and these troops are still the so-called elite troops of the United States.
    Morale is determined by the social system, national policy, and war objectives. The American social system is a capitalist system of exploitation of man by man; the policy of the American ruling group is an imperialist policy of oppressing the people at home and expanding aggression abroad; the purpose of the United States to launch a war is to satisfy the ambition of a small group of financial oligarchs to dominate the world; these are all directly against the interests of the broad masses. Therefore, the morale of the American army cannot be built on the basis of the people's political consciousness, but can only be built on the basis of the ruling class's coercive means. The root cause of the low morale of the United States lies in this.
    Stalin said in his discussion of the Soviet Union's Patriotic War: "The strength of the Red Army lies first of all in the fact that it is not waging a war of aggression, not an imperialist war, but a war of defending the motherland, a war of liberation, a just war." "German soldiers do not have a noble and glorious war aim that can inspire him and make him proud. On the contrary, every Red Army soldier can proudly declare that he is waging a just, liberating war, a war of defending the freedom and independence of the motherland. The Red Army has a noble and glorious war aim that can inspire its establishment of meritorious service. It is also for this reason that the Patriotic War has produced thousands of male and female heroes in our country who have vowed to fight to the death for the freedom of the motherland." In the Second World War, many young people in the United States, with the patriotism inspired by the Pearl Harbor Incident, voluntarily enlisted in the army to participate in the anti-aggression struggle. But this time, after the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, the American ruling group could not inspire morale in conscription and mobilization, and could only use absurd advertisements such as "Are you afraid of the threat of unemployment? Are you afraid of a bleak future? There are beauties in the East, and fine wine in the West..." to deceive the people into being cannon fodder. At the same time, in contrast to the Soviet Red Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which regard strict military discipline as the most important condition for the combat effectiveness of the armed forces, the military discipline of the American army is manifested by the extent of the corruption from the heads of the troops tolerating the soldiers' rape and looting. Such an army is bound to fail.
    Insufficient manpower and low morale are the two major insurmountable weaknesses of American imperialism militarily. These two weaknesses have become increasingly apparent since it launched its war of aggression. The United States has lost 60,000 to 70,000 people in the Korean War for several months, and incidents of defection and desertion have also occurred continuously in the U.S. military. We can easily assert that the war of aggression launched by the American imperialists is doomed to failure.

　　美国兵力透视
　　谭文瑞
    美国帝国主义者正在加紧计划发动新的侵略战争，以图建立世界霸权。战争贩子们原以为世界性侵略冒险可以依靠毁灭性的武器取得廉价的胜利。朝鲜战事的发展使他们受到了严重的教训。美国侵略者在朝鲜所投下的赌注，愈来愈大，它的泥足也愈陷愈深了。
    谁都知道，大规模的现代战争必须依赖善于应用武器与技术的强大武装部队。至于主张只使用原子弹便可赢得战争的幼稚论调，现在甚至受到美国军界人士的轻视和批评。他们认为原子弹对于现代战争的若干原理的影响，并不会更大于火药、毒气、坦克及飞机发明的当时。美国“自由主义”的军事评论家威尔纳说过：“一个国家所有的军事力量决不能超出它所有的实际战斗力。假如没有足够的战士和战斗部队去使用可供使用的军事武器和机械，那末未经使用可供使用的机械装备必须作为军事剩余品而予以勾销。”他指出美国的主要缺陷是“缺少有训练有组织的战斗力量”。在美国要增调更多的军队去扩大侵略朝鲜的战争的时候，新上任的美国国防部长马歇尔也曾承认，美国缺乏有训练的后备兵力。他焦急地说：“要补足在朝鲜作战的部队，就必须现在把美国的军队调光。”
    美国在发动武装侵略朝鲜战争的初期，投在朝鲜的兵力是残缺不全的五个师，约七八万人，以后又曾陆续增兵，到九月中旬，更疯狂地动员了它在远东的海、陆、空军全部所余的部队四万余人，由麦克阿瑟亲自指挥在仁川登陆。于是美国侵略军增到七个师另一个团，共达十四万人以上。为了要补充在远东的兵力，原驻在美国国内的一个步兵师也被调出国外，因此尚留在美国本土的地面作战部队，只有空运部队一个师和海军陆战队一个师，约三万余人。美国在进行武装侵略计划的初期，就已露出了“捉襟见肘”的窘相。
    做着统治全世界迷梦的美国帝国主义到底拥有多少数目的军队呢？据纽约时报一九五○年五月所发表的美国官方公布数字，美国正规部队的总兵力是一、四五八、四○○人，其中陆军五九六、○○○人，海军四五四、四○○人，空军四○八、○○○人。这就是说，美国在发动侵朝战争前夕，武装部队的总数在一百四十五万至一百五十万人左右。此外还有二百五十万的后备人员。对于和平时期的美国，这样的人数，可说是最大了。在一九三五年，美国的武装部队不过二十三万余人，在美国参加对日作战前一年的一九四○年，也只有四十一万人左右。美国现在所有的武装部队数目已比第二次世界大战前几年增加了三倍半到六倍。
    这里应当指出，在美国一百四十五万正规部队中，包括着很大数目的非战斗人员在内。譬如说，六十万美国陆军中，就有四十四万六千名非战斗人员，实际战斗兵力不到十六万人。况且美国的军队分散在世界各处。美国前任国防部长詹逊本年四月给杜鲁门的军备报告中说到：“美国在海外的所有驻军共占全国三军武装部队的百分之四十以上，近六十万人。”美国的六十万陆军中用于维持日本和西德的长期占领的就有二十七万人，此外在奥地利、的里雅斯特、菲律宾、希腊等美国势力所到之处都有美国驻军。美国的海军和空军也有大部分驻于美国海外的四百多个军事基地。力量的分散，使几十万军队变得更不顶用了。
    美国没有预早把它的武装部队扩充到更大的数目，主要的是因为美国军事当局迷信着原子武器与“战略空军”的威力，同时又感觉到美国的人力有限。
    今年六月以后，杜鲁门以侵朝战事为借口，采取了各种征兵动员的措施。十月七日根据美国会一九四八年六月通过的征兵法案，下令征兵，“对所有十八岁至二十五岁的男子进行登记，以备总统在任何时间他认为需要时即可征召入伍”。十月下旬又签署一项法案，把以后十二个月内服役期满的三十万人的现役期限延长一年。同时国防部宣布开始征召后备军人员入伍。杜鲁门宣布过他的计划是要把现役的海、陆、空军人数由一百五十万人增至三百万人。现在已开始征调后备军二十多万人，和准备在今年年底征足二十六万的新兵。十一月初美国兵役局局长赫希曾经表示，按目前的征兵条例，“美国不能产生并维持一个三百万人的军事编制”，要想把武装部队增加到三百万，就非采取进一步动员的措施不可。但是实际上目前只征召二十四至二十五岁未婚男子的初步征兵已遭到挫折，许多被征的青年并未报到，而报到的又有百分之四十体格不合标准。如果要进一步征召退伍军人、自由职业者和已婚男子，必然更加困难。美国时常吹嘘它有八百万退伍军人，其实在一九四一年或者一九四二年入伍的退伍军人，现在年龄多已在三十岁以上，而且有一部分超过四十岁，由他们组成的军队将不是“少爷兵”而是“老爷兵”了。同时，一般退伍军人都是不愿意再穿上军装的，他们之中许多人甚至认为在上次战争中上前线去拚命而让别人在后方发财是上了大当，他们知道未来的战争将不会再是上一次那样的便宜战争，如果在上次战争中丧命的机会是百分之十，这一回可就会是百分之九十。美国统治者欺骗人民当兵的广告上最惯用的标语是“参加军队，周游世界”，而今天流行于美国人民中间的一句话是“参加军队，周游另一世界（死亡）”。今天在美国已经没有多少人愿意为华尔街的利益去当炮灰了。
    当然，沉迷于军事冒险计划的美国统治阶级，是可能不顾一切采取高压手段驱使美国人民入伍的。但是据美国政府的统计，在它的一亿四千万人口中，只有六千六百万有劳动力的男女，而美国平时的工业生产和运输工作等就需要六千万在业工人去维持，扩大的战时生产所需的人力自然还要更多些。在第二次世界大战中，美国政府费了最大的力量动员了一千一百万的兵员（包括妇女），已经使得美国的战时经济受到很大的影响。美国要想动员同样数目的兵员去进行新的战争，是非常困难的。
    纵使美国统治集团，用尽威迫利诱的方法，可以在明年年底凑够三百万军队的数目，还是不足以担当世界规模的侵略战争计划。根据美国陆军部的计划，三百万武装部队中，陆军只占一百三十万人，而实际有战斗力的地面部队不过五六十万。我们试回顾一下第二次世界大战的历史，联合国与轴心国双方投在战斗中的武装部队总数达九千三百万人之巨，仅是苏联所动员的兵力就是二千二百万。德国在欧洲用了一千七百万部队发动侵略，日本在亚洲的侵略军也超过六百万以上，但是终于被苏联和中国所击败。而且在第二次世界大战中，兵员的消耗也是惊人的。从希特勒的国防军与冲锋队进攻波兰起，到杜尼兹上将宣布无条件投降止，德国一共损失了近一千万的军队（仅是伤亡）。美国如果只能拥有几十万地面战斗部队，这和它征服世界的侵略冒险计划，岂不是太不相称了吗？目前在朝鲜——一个只有三千万人口的国家——进行的战争，就已吸住了十几万美军，几乎等于美国目前全部战斗兵力的百分之六十。几十万军队还不够去打像德寇进攻斯大林格勒那样的一场仗。再看第二次世界大战中，日本驻在我国东北的关东军七十多万，不到半个月就被苏联的红军歼灭干净了。
    美国企图补救它人力不足的一个如意算盘，是驱使西欧各国的人民去替它当炮灰。美国帝国主义者早就提出“美国出钱出武器，欧洲国家出人力”，或者“美国出战略空军”，英国出“战术空军”与海军，法国出“陆军”等等的论调，并且利用“北大西洋公约”纠集西欧各仆从国去组织所谓“集体”的侵略部队。这一套计划已酝酿了许多时候，由于美国的不断大施压力，据北大西洋公约侵略集团的所谓军事委员会会议发表公报称，西欧各国已同意“尽早建立一支统一指挥的联合军队”，但是据美国合众社的电讯透露，关于“欧洲军”是否建立、何时建立以及怎样建立的问题，都还要大费争论。一方面各仆从国家的统治者惧怕人民的反对，不能不有所顾忌。另一方面英、法、荷等几个主要国家都各有隐忧：越南人民军的英勇战斗已把法国拖得筋疲力竭；英国殖民者要镇压马来亚人民解放斗争，出动了十多万的军队还是无济于事；荷兰担心着印尼人民力量的再起。还是把兵力牵制在印尼。美国盗用联合国名义发动侵略朝鲜的战争后，靠很大的压力迫使各仆从国家供献了几万军队。可是这些帮凶国家对于战争前途不得不感到“深深的忧虑”。法国国防部长莫克最近说到西欧各国出兵的困难。他表示即使有了美国的三十亿美元的援助，法国的军力到一九五一年不可能超过十个师，一九五二年也只可增到十五个师，一九五三年才可增到二十五个师。法国目前只有五个师的武装部队。而这些军队的战斗力比一九四○年委弃马奇诺防线的法军还要弱。但是法国的军队是被视为西欧集体侵略军的核心的，怪不得威尔纳说这样的计划“不是一个不可饶恕的战略过失，就是一出滑稽戏”。至于英国，驻在英伦本土和西德的军队约有三十万，另外有三十多万军队驻在殖民地，但是英国的实际战斗兵力也不会比法国强多少。据伦敦官方说，如下动员令也只能组成十个师的正规军。至于挪威、丹麦等国家的兵力恐怕只够保护自己的飞机场。总之，在目前西欧各国是调不出二十个师的兵力来的，而据美英集团的战略家估计，“守卫易北河需要五十到六十个师”。如果要在欧洲发动进攻，则非八十到一百个师的兵力不可了，美国从那里弄来这么多的“同盟军”？
    美国帝国主义者终于卑鄙无耻到乞助于法西斯匪帮的残余势力了。他公然企图重建德国和日本的军力，利用希特勒的纳粹军和日本的“皇军”充当它侵略军的先锋队。然而这一阴谋不但因为帝国主义集团内部存在着的矛盾而难于实现；并且正受到全世界人民的强烈反对。苏德等八国外长会议抗议重新武装德国的严正声明和苏联斥责美国利用日本军队进行侵略罪行的正义控诉，获得了广大人民的拥护。更重要的是今天德国人民和日本人民已大大的觉醒，不会再甘心给侵略者当炮灰。而且德国和日本的军事体制在第二次世界大战中基本上已被摧毁，想再组成像当年的纳粹军或者“皇军”那样的军队，可以说是根本不可能的。
    美国不但没有足够的兵员，而且所能组成的军队也是士气低落不能作战的。在朝鲜的战争中已充分暴露了美国侵略军的怯懦与孱弱，而这些军队还是美国所谓最精锐的部队。
    士气是社会制度、国家政策和战争目的所决定的。美国的社会制度是一种人剥削人的资本主义制度；美国统治集团的政策是一种对内压迫人民对外扩张侵略的帝国主义政策；美国要发动战争的目的是在满足一小撮金融寡头统治世界的野心；这些都是直接违反广大群众利益的。因此美国军队的士气不可能建筑在人民政治觉悟的基础上，而只能建筑在统治阶级威迫利诱手段的基础上。美国士气低沉的根源就在于此。
    斯大林在论到苏联的卫国战争中说：“红军的力量首先就在于，它所进行的不是侵略战争，不是帝国主义战争，而是保卫祖国的、解放的、正义的战争。”“德国兵士没有足以鼓舞他，使他能引为自豪的高尚光荣的战争目的。反之，任何一个红军战士都能自豪地声言说，他是进行着正义的、解放的战争，进行着捍卫祖国自由独立的战争。红军是有足以鼓舞其建立勋功的高尚的光荣的战争目的。也正是由于这个原因，所以卫国战争，就在我国产生了成千成万为祖国自由而誓死奋斗的男女英雄。”在第二次世界大战中，美国不少的青年，有着珍珠港事变所激发的爱国心，自动报名入伍参加反侵略的战斗。但在这一次美国发动侵朝战争后征兵动员，美国统治集团可就无法激励士气，只能以“你怕失业的威胁吗？你怕前途茫茫吗？东方有美女，西方有葡萄美酒……”等荒诞的广告去诱骗人民当炮灰。同时，正与把严格的军纪作为武装部队战斗力最重要条件的苏联红军和中国人民解放军相反，美国军队的军纪，从带兵的头目们纵容士兵奸淫掳掠事实就表现出败坏的程度了。这样的军队是必然要失败的。
    人力不足与士气低落是美国帝国主义军事上不可克服的两大弱点。这两项弱点在它发动侵略战争以后，日益明显地暴露出来。美国在朝鲜进行了几个月的侵略战争，就已损失了六七万人，而且叛变和逃亡的事件在美军中间也已连续发生。我们不难断言：美国帝国主义者所进行的侵略战争，是注定要失败的。
