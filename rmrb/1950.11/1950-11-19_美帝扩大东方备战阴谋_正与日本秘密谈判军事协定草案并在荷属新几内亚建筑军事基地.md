　　Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: TASS, 16th dispatch from Tokyo: MacArthur's staff and the Japanese government are now secretly negotiating a draft military agreement between the United States and Japan. The draft agreement stipulates that three divisions of the U.S. military will continue to occupy Japan for thirty years. The strength of the so-called Japanese Police Reserve Force will be doubled. This force will be equipped with modern weapons and will, in fact, perform its duties under the support of the United States, although the United States uses the signboard of the United Nations organization to conceal its command of the force. The draft agreement also stipulates that Japan and the South Korean regime conclude an "anti-communist pact," and stipulates that Japan participate in the aggressive Pacific Pact that the United States is now hastily piecing together. As stipulated in the draft agreement, the United States will provide the Japanese army with all necessary equipment and grant Japan military loans of no less than one billion U.S. dollars.
    Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: TASS, 14th dispatch: The Sydney *Sun* published a report from Canberra by its reporter Hogue, stating that the United States is building powerful military bases in Dutch New Guinea and is requesting the Australian government to strengthen the defense of Papua. The reporter pointed out that this is one of the secret decisions made by Truman and MacArthur at the Wake Island meeting, the purpose of which is to establish "the closest contact" between the Australian army and the American aggressive base in Dutch New Guinea. The *Sun* also revealed that the Dutch government has agreed to give the United States priority in establishing military bases in Dutch New Guinea. Truman, in turn, "promised" the Dutch government that "the United States will definitely support it in resisting Indonesia's territorial claims to Dutch New Guinea."

　　美帝扩大东方备战阴谋
    正与日本秘密谈判军事协定草案并在荷属新几内亚建筑军事基地
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社十六日电引东京消息：麦克阿瑟的僚属和日本政府，现在正秘密谈判美国和日本间的军事协定草案。协定草案规定美军三个师继续占领日本三十年。所谓日本警察后备队的实力，则将增加两倍。该队将以现代武器装备，并实际上将在美国的支持下执行职务，虽然美国对该队的统率是用联合国组织的招牌来掩饰的。协定草案又规定日本和南朝鲜政权缔结“反共公约”，并规定日本参加美国现在正匆匆拼凑中的侵略性太平洋公约。如协定草案所规定的，美国将供给日军一切必要的装备，并给予日本不下于十亿美元的军事贷款。
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社十四日讯：悉尼《太阳报》载该报记者荷格自堪培拉的报道称：美国正在荷属新几内亚建筑强大的军事基地，并要求澳大利亚政府加强巴布亚的防务。该记者指出，这是杜鲁门和麦克阿瑟在威克岛会谈的秘密决定之一，目的在于建立澳大利亚军队与荷属新几内亚美国侵略基地之间的“最密切的联络”。《太阳报》并透露：荷兰政府同意给予美国在荷属新几内亚建立军事基地以优先权。杜鲁门则“答应”荷兰政府，“美国一定支持它抵制印尼对荷属新几内亚的领土要求”。
