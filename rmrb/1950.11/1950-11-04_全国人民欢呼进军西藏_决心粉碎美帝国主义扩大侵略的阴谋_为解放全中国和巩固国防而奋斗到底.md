Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The people of the whole country are elated by the unveiling of the grand march to liberate Tibet; and unanimously expressed their determination to fully support the People's Liberation Army and the Korean people, to strive for the liberation of all of China, consolidate national defense, and smash the US imperialist conspiracy to expand aggression.

In the Southwest, Chongqing's Xinhua Daily, Ta Kung Pao, and Xinmin Daily all devoted a large portion of their front pages on the 2nd to publishing news of the advance into Tibet and the warm welcome and support of the advancing troops by the people of the Southwest. They also published commentaries, unanimously cheering the advance into Tibet. When the news reached the venue of the first Chongqing Municipal Democratic Youth Congress, the whole room erupted in applause and cheers. A resolution was immediately passed to send a letter of慰问慰问 to the People's Liberation Army arduously advancing into Tibet. Yue Songshan, a model worker representative from the Southwest, said excitedly: "Let the imperialists see the power of the Chinese people! In the future, our workers will work harder to produce and actively support the advancing troops."

In the Northwest, in Xi'an City, around 8:30 in the morning on the 2nd, the news of the victorious advance into Tibet had spread from newspapers to factories, schools, and nearby rural areas throughout the city. Workers at the private Dahua Textile Factory immediately copied the news onto the blackboard newspaper. In the model village of Huangjia Village in the suburbs, men and women farmers gathered around those reading the newspaper, listening to the good news. To show their support for the People's Liberation Army, the entire village completed the storage of all public grain in one day. Newspapers in Lanzhou City published special editions on the advance into Tibet. Wherever the special editions were posted, crowds gathered to watch, with people of Han, Hui, Uyghur, and Tibetan ethnicities excitedly discussing the news. Workers at the Northwest Textile Factory jumped for joy and unanimously shouted: "Step up production and support the front lines!" When the good news of the advance into Tibet reached the conference in Xining City, Qinghai Province, where people of all ethnic groups and circles welcomed the Central Northwest Visiting Group, the more than 12,000 participants cheered enthusiastically, with thunderous applause. Xiraojiacuo (Tibetan), Vice Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government, said excitedly at the meeting: "The Tibetan people under imperialist oppression have long eagerly hoped for liberation. Now the Tibetan people will also enjoy a free and happy life like the Tibetan compatriots in Qinghai Province." He also hoped that the Tibetan people and the Tibetan compatriots and people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai should actively support the People's Liberation Army in quickly liberating Tibet. Xi Yuanshou, a Tu ethnic representative, paid tribute to the People's Liberation Army advancing into Tibet on behalf of the Tu people, and expressed that they would support the People's Liberation Army with practical actions to resolutely implement the resolutions of the provincial representative conference.

People's organizations such as the Preparatory Committee of the Central South Federation of Trade Unions, the Central South Working Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, have sent telegrams to express their sympathy for the People's Liberation Army advancing into Tibet. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Wuhan held seminars separately. Commanders and soldiers unanimously agreed to strengthen national defense construction to support their brother units in completing the task of liberating Tibet. Zhu Chengchun, a special-class labor model, issued a challenge letter for a production competition to workers in his factory, guaranteeing to complete and exceed the production tasks for November. Guangzhou's Nanfang Daily, Lianhe Bao, and Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po all published news of the People's Liberation Army's advance into Tibet on the front pages of their newspapers on the 2nd, and published commentaries or special articles introducing the situation in Tibet. The commentaries in various newspapers unanimously pointed out the strength of the Chinese people, and any imperialist conspiracy to invade and obstruct our liberation of all of China will be completely shattered. In Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, on the morning of the 2nd, news of the advance into Tibet had been written on all the city's blackboard newspapers. After hearing the news, Qiu Yeheng, a representative of labor models in the city, called on all employees to respond to the patriotic production competition in Zhao Guo's workshop to support the People's Liberation Army's advance into Tibet and respond to the US imperialist mad aggression.

People in East China, Northeast China, and North China also cheered in unison for the advance into Tibet. Yixi Bozhen (female), a Tibetan compatriot living in Nanjing, said gratefully: "The Tibetan compatriots' desire to return to the big family of the motherland can now be achieved." The family members of revolutionary soldiers in the sixth district of Nanjing jointly wrote a letter to their husbands and sons, instructing them to complete the glorious task of liberating Tibet as soon as possible, and prepared to launch a strong struggle against the US imperialist conspiracy to expand aggression. People in Wuhu City, Southern Anhui, saw the special edition of the Southern Anhui Daily at 11:00 p.m. on the 1st. Democratic parties and people's organizations in southern Anhui have successively written to the Southern Anhui Daily, unanimously expressing their determination to resolutely support the Korean people, smash the US imperialist conspiracy to expand the war of aggression, and vow to fight to the end to defend the motherland and liberate all of China. Workers, peasants, students, etc. in Chengde City, Rehe Province, Northeast China, were all overjoyed when they saw the special edition. Model worker Liu Changgui said: "All ethnic groups in China are closely united, and we have the strength to smash any imperialist conspiracy of aggression." Representatives attending the Provincial People's Congress of all circles, which is being held in Baoding, Hebei Province, North China, expressed their opinions. Army support model Rong Guanxiu and labor hero Gao Guandou said excitedly: "Tibet is the southwest gate of China. With the liberation of Tibet, China's border defense will be more consolidated. We must step up production and actively pay grain, not only to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Tibet, but also to help the Korean people smash US imperialist aggression and consolidate the Northeast's national defense."
