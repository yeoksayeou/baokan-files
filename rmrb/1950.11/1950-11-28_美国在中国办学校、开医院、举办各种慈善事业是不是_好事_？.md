To the Editor:

I have recently read many articles in the newspaper exposing American imperialism and its relationship with China. I have a clearer understanding of the so-called "American way of life" and the aggressive face of American imperialism. However, I still have a question that I can't quite understand: Isn't it a good thing for the United States to run schools, open hospitals, and conduct various charitable undertakings in China? Or is this also a form of aggression? Please provide an answer.

Respectfully,
Huang Daoyuan

Comrade Huang Daoyuan:

To judge whether the various actions of the United States in China are good or bad, we must examine its purpose and effect, and see who it serves. On the surface, it seems like the United States is doing "good deeds" for the Chinese people by running schools, opening hospitals, and conducting various so-called charitable undertakings, as if it is out of "good intentions." However, if you investigate the purpose of these "good deeds," you will reach the opposite conclusion.

What is the purpose of these "good deeds"? Let's look at the answer from E.J. James, the president of the University of Illinois. In a memorandum to President Roosevelt, he said: "The nation which succeeds in educating the young Chinese of the coming generation will reap the largest possible returns in influence in spiritual and commercial lines from the efforts it expends..." "Money spent for the expansion of spiritual influence will return more to us, even from a materialistic standpoint, than money spent in any other way. Trade follows the spiritual dominion more certainly than it follows the flag." (See Wang Minzhi's "A Short History of American Aggression Against China").

In order to "expand spiritual influence," the American bosses, who haggle over every penny with American workers (even a dime or two of extra wages is often the cause of major strikes), are willing to spend large sums of money on "good deeds" in China. According to incomplete statistics this year, there are a total of 1,755 American-run church schools at all levels in China, accounting for 26.61% of the total number of church schools in China, of which primary schools account for one-quarter of the total, and secondary schools account for more than half. There are a total of 146 American-run church hospitals in China, accounting for 29.6% of all church hospitals. The United States also has the most social relief undertakings. American imperialism has always provided direct financial support to these "good deeds," considering them necessary regular expenses. According to statistics, all higher church schools in China need at least US$3.5 million in foreign remittances each year, of which Christian universities receive approximately US$2 to US$3 million annually from the United States. Catholic universities are the responsibility of the sponsoring congregations and the Vatican, or subsidized by various national governments. Imperialism, especially American imperialism, which lives entirely by plundering the wealth of the people at home and abroad, is so generous in this regard! The importance of "expanding spiritual influence" for the expansion of American imperialist aggression is self-evident.

Naturally, the means used by American imperialism to achieve the goal of "expanding spiritual influence" are quite clever. It does not necessarily directly promote its aggressive policies or the doctrine of "America First" to the Chinese people in churches, schools, hospitals, and "charitable" organizations. Instead, it uses God, the atmosphere of life and "Christian dogma," and small favors to "Americanize" your thinking. As far as church schools are concerned, some even exude an atmosphere of "democracy" and "freedom," attempting to gradually pull your heart away from the land of your motherland and drift to the other side of the Pacific. In the required English anthologies, there are works by Shakespeare, as well as articles promoting the power of the atomic bomb, and even letters home from members of Chennault's "Flying Tigers." Isn't this a concrete manifestation of the "democracy" and "freedom" of the American aggressors in textbooks? But it will never be free enough to include articles reflecting the American economic panic, the American workers' strike struggles, the American election scandals, the American persecution of black people, etc., as well as letters home from peace fighters such as American Communist leader Dennis from prison in English textbooks. In terms of extracurricular reading, American professors assign you to read novels such as "Gone with the Wind" and "Amber," making you feel elated and unwilling to let go; but they will not assign you to read Dreiser's "An American Tragedy" or Golding's "Jews Without Money," etc. In terms of life, they give you American flour to eat and a "glass socks" to wear, but when you participate in the anti-American and pro-Japanese movement, Mr. John Leighton Stuart, the "friend of China," will also put on a stern face and issue a statement saying that you do not appreciate good intentions and repay kindness with enmity, making you feel both amused and annoyed. In short, as long as your heart is immersed in novels such as "Gone with the Wind" and "Amber," you forget your motherland and the struggles of your motherland, and yearn for American "charity" and the power of the atomic bomb, you can fully enjoy "democracy" and "freedom"; but when you participate in your motherland's anti-imperialist struggle, especially the anti-American struggle, the "friends of China" will put on a stern face to reprimand you. As agents of American imperialism, the "educators" and "philanthropists," no matter how "enlightened" they pretend to be, cannot forget the purpose of their "pretending to be enlightened," so when it comes to a critical moment, they can no longer pretend. They remember the aforementioned memorandum from James better than the Bible.

Cultural aggression and ideological anaesthesia through missionary work, education, and charity are all soft knives that kill without bloodshed, and their purpose is to dilute the blood shed by the Chinese people under the hard knives of American imperialism, weaken hatred towards American imperialism, and cultivate comprador thinking and national inferiority such as worshiping, being pro-American, and fearing the United States, so as to facilitate American imperialist expansion of economic plunder, political interference, espionage activities, and military aggression. This is the role of "expanding spiritual influence." The reason why American imperialism uses airplanes and cannons to arm the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to massacre the Chinese people while using so-called relief materials to "relieve" the Chinese people is precisely for this reason. However, in fighting China, especially in the new China that has already overthrown the reactionary government of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the complete realization of American imperialism's conspiracy to "expand spiritual influence" is impossible. Among the students in church schools, haven't many staunch patriotic fighters against aggression also emerged? However, cultural aggression is still cultural aggression, and it must be constantly exposed and attacked, just as political and military aggression by American imperialism must be exposed and attacked.

### 美国在中国办学校、开医院、举办各种慈善事业是不是“好事”？

　　美国在中国办学校、开医院、举办各种慈善事业是不是“好事”？
    编者同志：
    我近来看了报上许多关于揭露美帝国主义及其对华关系的文章，对于所谓“美国生活方式”和美帝的侵略面目，都认识得较清楚了。但有一个问题还搞不清楚，就是美国在中国办学校，开医院，举办各种慈善事业，难道也不能算作好事吗？难道也是一种侵略吗？请予解答。
    黄道原敬上
    黄道原同志：
    我们判断美国在中国各种行动的好坏，必须研究它的目的和作用，看它是为谁服务的。美国在中国办学校，开医院，举办各种所谓慈善事业，表面上好像是为中国人服务，好像是出于“一片好心”的好事。但你只要究明这些“好事”的目的，就会得出相反的结论。
    这些“好事”的目的是什么呢？请看美国伊里诺州大学校长詹姆士（E.J.James）的回答吧。他在致总统罗斯福的备忘录中说：“那一个国家能做到教育这一代的年青中国人，那一个国家就将由于在这方面所支付的努力而在精神的商业的影响上取得最大可能的收获。……”“为了扩张精神上的影响而化一些钱，即使只从物质意义上说，也能比别的方法收获得更多。商业追随精神上的支配，是比追随军旗更为可靠的。”（见汪敏之著《美国侵华小史》）。
    “为了扩张精神上的影响”，对美国工人锱铢较量（连加一毛几分工钱都不愿意，大罢工往往由此酿成）的美国大老板们，不惜在中国花大笔钱做“好事”。据本年不完全的统计，美国在中国的各级教会学校共有一千七百五十五所，占中国教会学校总数百分之二六·六一，其中小学占全数四分之一，中学占一半以上。美国在中国的教会医院共一百四十六所，占全部教会医院百分之二十九·六。至于各种社会救济事业，也以美国的为最多。美帝国主义对这些“好事”一向给以直接的经济支援，认为是必需的经常开支。据统计，全中国高等教会学校每年约需外国汇款至少在三百五十万美元以上，其中基督教大学每年自美国汇来的款项约二百至三百万美元。天主教大学由各主办修会及教廷负责，或由各国政府津贴。专靠搜括国内外人民的脂膏为生的帝国主义，尤其是美帝国主义，在这一方面居然那样的慷慨！“扩张精神上的影响”，对于美帝扩大侵略的重要性，可想而知了。
    自然，美帝用以达到“扩张精神上的影响”这个目的的手段，是相当巧妙的。它不一定在教堂、学校、医院和“慈善”机关里直接向中国人宣传侵略政策，宣扬“美国第一”主义，而是通过上帝、通过生活气氛和“基督教义”、通过小恩小惠来使你的思想“美国化”。就教会学校说，有的甚至荡漾着“民主”“自由”的气氛，企图使你的心渐渐离开了祖国的大地，飘到太平洋彼岸去。在必修的英文选集里，有莎士比亚的作品，也有宣扬原子弹威力的文章，还有陈纳德的“飞虎队”队员的家书。这不是美国侵略者的“民主”和“自由”在课本里的具体表现吗？但它决不会自由到把反映美国的经济恐慌、美国工人的罢工斗争、美国的选举丑剧、美国迫害黑人的暴行等等的文章以及美共领袖但尼斯等和平斗士发自牢狱里的家书也收在英文课本里。在课外读物方面，美籍教授指定你看“飘”和“琥魄”一类的小说，使你看得飘飘然，不肯放手；但不会指定你看特莱塞的“美国的悲剧”、果尔特的“没钱的犹太人”等。在生活方面，给你美国面粉吃，给你一玻璃袜子”穿，但当你参加反美扶日运动的时候，“中国的朋友”司徒雷登先生也要扳起面孔发表声明，说你不识好歹，恩将怨报，使你哭笑不得。总而言之，只要你的心陶醉在“飘”和“琥魄”一类的小说里，忘掉祖国和祖国的斗争，向往于美国的“慈善”和原子弹的威力，你便可以充分享受“民主”和“自由”；但当你参加祖国的反帝斗争尤其是反美帝斗争的时候，“中国的朋友”们就要扳起面孔来申斥你了。作为美帝代办的“教育家”和“慈善家”们，无论伪装得怎样“开明”，但总不能忘掉自己所以“伪装开明”的目的，所以一到紧要关头，便再也伪装不下去了。他们对于上述詹姆士的备忘录，比圣经记得还热哩。
    通过传教、教育和慈善事业来进行的文化侵略和思想麻醉，都是杀人不见血的软刀子，其目的在于冲淡中国人民在美帝的硬刀子下所流的鲜血，削弱对美帝的仇恨，培养崇美、亲美、恐美等买办思想和民族自卑感，以便于美帝扩大经济搜括、政治干涉、特务活动和军事侵略。这便是“扩张精神上的影响”的作用。美帝所以一边用飞机大炮武装蒋匪帮来屠杀中国人民，一边又用所谓救济物资来“救济”中国人民，原因即在于此。然而在战斗的中国，特别是在已经推翻了美帝的奴才蒋匪帮反动政府的新中国，美帝要完全实现其“扩张精神上的影响”的阴谋，是不可能的。在教会学校的学生中，不是也出现了许多反侵略的坚强爱国斗士吗？然而文化侵略还是文化侵略，必须不断加以揭发和打击，正如揭发和打击美帝的政治侵略和军事侵略一样。
