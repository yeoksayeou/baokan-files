	The Soviet Union – The Great Banner-Bearer of Peace
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 1st dispatch (TASS)]: Today, the Message News published an editorial titled "The Soviet State - The Great Banner-Bearer of Peace," stating that for thirty-three years since its founding, the Soviet Union has been tirelessly engaged in the indomitable struggle for peace. This fair and just peace policy, as Comrade Stalin, the great teacher of the Soviet people and all progressive humanity, said, is in line with the vital interests of our people who are currently engaged in peaceful construction labor. This policy has won the greatest sympathy and resolute support from all peace-loving people of all nationalities.

    Hundreds of millions of ordinary people in countries around the world believe that the peace program upheld by the Soviet government is their own program, and no one, nothing can destroy this belief in their hearts, because this program is in line with the interests, hopes, and aspirations of the people of all countries and all working humanity. Countries that have already broken free from the shackles of the imperialists, our friends and allies in the struggle for peace—the People's Republic of China, the People's Democratic Republics of Central and Southeast Europe, and the German Democratic Republic—actively support the Soviet Union's foreign policy.

    The editorial emphasized that the Soviet people are at the forefront of the peace movement. All Soviet adults—more than 115 million people—have signed the Stockholm Appeal. The people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union unanimously agree with the decisions adopted at the Second All-Soviet Congress of Supporters of Peace recently held in Moscow.

    All working humanity looks up to the Soviet people, regarding them as the leading force in the struggle for peace. The Soviet government, representing the will of these Soviet people, spares no effort to find solutions to today's most pressing issue—the issue of peace, the issue of eliminating the threat of war. Recent international public opinion has once again gained convincing proof of the Soviet Union's peace-loving purpose.

    At the proposal of the Soviet government, a meeting of the eight foreign ministers was held in Prague. The statement issued by the meeting regarding the New York resolutions of the three Western countries on remilitarizing West Germany exposed the peace-threatening policies of these countries and, based on the interests of peace-loving countries and the German people themselves, put forward a truly democratic program for solving the German question.

    The initiatives put forward by the Soviet government at the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly are of great international significance. The declaration proposed by the Soviet delegation on halting the threat of a new war and consolidating world peace and security includes many concrete suggestions that can play a significant role in establishing and enhancing international friendly relations and in resolving international issues.

    The editorial pointed out that today, when armed aggression has become the cornerstone of the imperialists' policy, they are particularly disgusted by the Soviet Union's peace policy. Imperialist politicians claim that the essence of the Soviet proposals is similar to the demands expressed by peace fighters in the Stockholm Appeal and the message of the Second World Peace Congress, and they can find no better reason to "refute" the Soviet proposals.

    The editorial continued, stating that the Soviet proposals are fully in line with the peace program put forward by honest people from all over the world united in the international peace movement. When the Soviet delegation, representing the Soviet government and the Soviet people, put forward these proposals at the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, they were also speaking for the people of all countries who long for peace. And this is where the great power of the Soviet proposals lies, and this is where the great power of Stalin's foreign policy lies. Therefore, although the warmongers, controlling the obedient majority in the United Nations, attempt to destroy the peace program advocated by the Soviet Union, their attempts are in vain. The real majority of humanity outside the United Nations General Assembly has increasingly realized that the imperialist warmongers indiscriminately threaten the people of all countries, and hundreds of millions of peace supporters are uniting under the banner of fighting for peace.

    The preparations for the Second World Peace Congress, which will be held in mid-November, show that the idea of ​​fighting for peace and for strengthening international cooperation has become an important ideological factor for the people of all countries and has become a huge and effective force. At various gatherings held in various countries to prepare for the Second World Peace Congress, people called out the name of the peace fortress—the Soviet Union—with love and gratitude, and called out the name of the great banner-bearer of peace—Comrade Stalin.

    The editorial concluded that the Second World Peace Congress will become a grand meeting of the people of all countries who have united and are determined to defend the cause of peace. The Soviet people's struggle for peace and the Stalinist foreign policy consistently pursued by the Soviet state are vivid examples that inspire hundreds of millions of peace supporters.

    苏联——伟大的和平旗手
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科一日电：今日消息报以《苏维埃国家——伟大的和平旗手》为题发表社论称，苏联立国三十三年来一直在孜孜不倦地进行着争取和平的不屈不挠的斗争。这种光明正大的和平政策，正如苏联人民及全体进步人类的伟大导师斯大林同志所说，乃是符合于刻正从事和平建设劳动的我国人民的切身利益。这个政策赢得了全体爱好和平的各族人民的最大同情和坚决赞助。
    世界各国亿万普通人民都相信，苏联政府所维护的和平纲领便是他们自己的纲领，任何人、任何东西都不能摧毁他们心中的这个信念，因为这个纲领是符合世界各国人民、全体劳动人类的利益、希冀和愿望的。各个已经摆脱帝国主义者的镣铐的国家，我们争取和平的斗争中的友人和同盟者——中华人民共和国、中欧和东南欧各人民民主国家、德意志民主共和国——都积极支持苏联的外交政策。
    社论强调称，苏联人民正走在保卫和平运动的最前列。苏联的全体成年人——一亿一千五百余万人——都在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。苏联各族人民一致赞同最近在莫斯科举行的第二届全苏拥护和平大会所通过的决定。
    全体劳动人类仰望着苏联人民，认为他们是争取和平的斗争中的领导力量，苏联政府代表这些苏联人民的意志，不遗余力地设法解决今日最迫切的问题——和平问题，消除战争威胁的问题。最近国际舆论又获得了苏联爱好和平之目的的令人信服的明证。
    在苏联政府的提议下，在布拉格召开了八国外长会议。会议就西方三国重使西德军事化的纽约决议所发表的声明，揭露了这些国家威胁和平的政策，并且根据爱好和平的各国人民及德国人民本身的利益，提出了解决德国问题的真正民主的纲领。
    苏联政府在联合国大会第五次会议上所提出的倡议是具有非常重大的国际意义的。苏联代表团所提的关于制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全的宣言中包括许多具体的建议，这些建议能够在建立和增进国际友好关系方面，在解决国际问题方面发生重大的作用。
    社论指出，今天，当武装侵略变成了帝国主义者政策的基石的时候，他们便特别憎恶苏联的和平政策。帝国主义的政客们宣称苏联提案的实质与和平斗士们在斯德哥尔摩宣言和召开第二届世界保卫和平大会的文告中所表示的要求相近，此外，他们再找不到更好的理由来“反驳”苏联的提案了。
    社论继称，苏联的这些建议是完全符合于世界各国团结在国际和平运动中的正直人民所提出的和平纲领的。当苏联代表团在联合国大会第五次会议上代表苏联政府、代表苏联人民提出这些建议的时候，他们也是代表所有渴望和平的各国人民发言的。而且这便是蕴藏着苏联提案的伟大力量的所在，这便是蕴藏着斯大林外交政策的伟大力量的所在。因此，战争贩子们虽然控制着联合国中唯命是从的大多数，企图摧毁苏联所主张的和平纲领，但他们的企图是徒劳无益的。联合国大会以外的真正的大多数人类已经愈来愈深刻地认识到，帝国主义战争贩子们毫无区别地威胁着各国人民，而且又有亿万和平拥护者正在团结到为和平而斗争的旗帜下。
    世界各国为即将于十一月中旬召开的第二届世界保卫和平大会而进行的筹备工作说明了：为争取和平、为加强国际合作而斗争的思想已经成了各国人民的重要思想因素，已经成了巨大的有效的力量。在各国筹备第二届世界保卫和平大会时所举行的各种集会上，人们都以热爱和感激的心情呼唤着和平堡垒——苏联的名字，呼唤着和平的伟大旗手——斯大林同志的名字。
    社论结语中称，第二届世界保卫和平大会将成为已经团结起来坚决保卫和平事业的各国人民的大会师。苏联人民争取和平的斗争、苏维埃国家始终不渝地奉行的斯大林外交政策，乃是鼓舞亿万和平拥护者的生动的榜样。
