　　Xinhua News Agency, 25th: The Korean people, who have been re-liberated from the iron heel of the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang as a result of the joint operations of the Chinese People's Volunteers who are resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes and defending our country, and the Korean People's Army, warmly welcome the Chinese People's Volunteers. According to the Korean Central News Agency: The Korean people in the Jeongju area on the west coast of Korea suffered the enemy's killings and insults during the days of occupation. The US-Syngman Rhee bandits, who committed all kinds of evil, slaughtered peaceful people everywhere, raped women, robbed food and livestock, and burned houses and crops. The joint operations of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army have re-liberated the Korean people in the Jeongju area. The local people, who have seen the light of day again, warmly cheered the Chinese People's Volunteers. The heroic Chinese soldiers held get-togethers with them and humbly and intimately comforted these Korean people who were in difficult circumstances. The Jeongju Korean people, who felt the brotherly friendship, expressed their high respect, love and gratitude to the Chinese People's Volunteers.
　　The Korean people in other areas are also deeply grateful to the Chinese People's Volunteers. Ahn Hyung-byeon, a farmer from Ryangga District, Bakcheon County, North Pyongan Province, carried comfort goods and letters of comfort from the farmers in the district to comfort the Korean People's Army units and the Chinese People's Volunteers. He said with infinite gratitude: "When we saw the Chinese People's Volunteers and our People's Army pursuing the retreating enemy side by side and coming to our village, our gratitude and joy were indescribable. Now, we have turned our gratitude into a support action to supply more food to the front line." Young man Lee Sang-il said: "The Chinese people have given us such warm assistance, which has infinitely strengthened our firm confidence in defeating the enemy. With the brotherly assistance of the Chinese people, all the youth of our Republic will be more brave and merciless in eliminating the enemy."

　　重获解放的朝鲜人民热烈欢迎我志愿部队
    【新华社二十五日讯】由于中国人民抗美援朝保家卫国志愿部队与朝鲜人民军并肩作战的结果，从美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮的铁蹄下重获解放的朝鲜人民热烈欢迎中国人民志愿部队。据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：朝鲜西海岸定州地区的朝鲜人民，在沦陷的日子里受尽了敌人的残杀和侮辱。无恶不作的美李匪军到处屠杀和平人民、强奸妇女、抢劫粮食和牲畜、焚烧房屋和庄稼。中国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军的并肩作战，使定州地区的朝鲜人民重获解放。重见天日的当地人民向中国人民志愿部队热烈欢呼。英勇的中国战士们与他们举行了联欢会，并谦逊而又亲密地慰问了这些正处于困难境况的朝鲜人民。感受到兄弟般的友谊的定州朝鲜人民，对中国人民志愿部队特别表示崇高的尊敬、爱戴和感激。
    其他地区的朝鲜人民也深深地感激中国人民志愿部队。平安北道博川县两嘉区农民安亨变，携带着该区农民的慰劳品和慰劳信去慰问朝鲜人民军部队和中国人民志愿部队。他无限感激地说：“当我们看到中国人民志愿部队和我们的人民军部队并肩追击溃退的敌人，而来到我们的村庄时，我们的感激和欢喜真是形容不出来的。现在，我们已经把感激变成了向前线供给更多粮食的支援行动。”青年李相一说：“中国人民给予我们这样热烈的援助，无限地增强了我们战胜敌人的坚定信心。我们共和国全体青年在中国人民兄弟般的援助下，一定会更加勇敢地、无情地去消灭敌人。”
