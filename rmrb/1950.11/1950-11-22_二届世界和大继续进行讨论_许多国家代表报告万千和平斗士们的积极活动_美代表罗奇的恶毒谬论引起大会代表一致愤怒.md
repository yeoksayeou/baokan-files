Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 21st - Comprehensive report from TASS: The Second World Peace Congress continued its discussions on the morning of the 19th.

　　Uruguayan representative Diaz spoke first, stating that Uruguay had already collected 120,000 signatures for peace. A nationwide protest and general strike by the Uruguayan people had forced the government to abandon its plan to send troops to Korea.

　　Algerian representative Bouchama, on behalf of the delegation, suggested to the Congress that peace advocates worldwide should provide full assistance to colonial peoples in their struggle for national independence and against the investment of their countries and wealth in aggressive wars.

　　Cuban representative Marineg said that 700,000 people in Cuba, or one-third of the country's adults, had signed the peace declaration.

　　Czechoslovakian representative Proyhach said that the Christian churches and clergy in Czechoslovakia had become active participants in the peace signature campaign.

　　American representative Roche, who has always been known for making provocative remarks at peace conferences, attempted to portray himself as a peace "defender" in his speech. However, his entire speech proved that he was an envoy of the American war-mongering clique. He opposed the peace declaration, slandered communist and workers' parties in various countries—shamelessly attacking Korea, China, and the German Democratic Republic, and protecting the Tito fascist group of Yugoslavia. His speech aroused unanimous anger from the delegates.

　　French representative Weiler presented to the Congress the demands of French doctors opposing German rearmament and supporting universal disarmament.

　　Representative Angelo of the Free Territory of Trieste said that Trieste had collected 102,000 peace signatures, 1,500 of which were collected in areas occupied by Tito's troops. Angelo said that the Trieste "Free" Territory had become a military base for aggression, where the American, British, and Yugoslav authorities were doing their utmost to stifle the voices of peace.

　　Indonesian representative Budiyo said that the Indonesian people would continue to contribute to the cause of defending peace.

　　At the afternoon session on the 19th, Israeli representative Dubi spoke, stating that Arabs and Jews in Israel had formed a united front in the peace movement. Dubi denounced the Israeli government for supporting American intervention in Korea.

　　Irish representative Earlie said that the Irish people were firmly opposed to participating in Britain's military plans.

　　Mexican representative Hala emphasized that the efforts of peace fighters would surely prevail because truth was on their side and they were participating in the glorious cause of saving humanity.

　　Former Republican Spanish Minister Quillar said: Every day we receive peace signatures from the Spanish people, who tell us that the real Spain is still alive and cannot be killed by Franco and his protectors! In a free Spain of tomorrow, the cause of peace will receive the broadest support, just as it does in the Spain that is fighting today.

　　French representative Faci spoke, stating that the French people had firmly embarked on the road of struggle for peace, with peace conferences convened in various provinces across the country, attended by 120,000 representatives. Faci then spoke about the current tasks of the World Peace Congress representatives.

　　Lebanese representative Hanna spoke, resolutely opposing the propaganda carried out by war merchants and denouncing Roche's vicious and hypocritical fallacies.

　　Representatives from Italy, Puerto Rico, Poland, and Costa Rica also spoke at the afternoon session.

　　According to the Congress Secretariat, the Congress received a total of 450 congratulatory telegrams from 22 countries on the 19th.
