[From Tianjin Daily News] Tianjin's representatives to the National Labor Model Representative Conference have spoken out one after another, opposing the US imperialists' expansion of the war of aggression to the point where the flames of war are burning to the Chinese border. They have also stated that they will step up production and construction and do their utmost to support the Korean people's patriotic war.

潘长有 (Pan Changyou)
The labor model Pan Changyou, who attended the National Congress of Labor, Peasants and Soldiers, said: "The sacred territory is not allowed to be invaded by the enemy, and the peaceful construction cause must not be destroyed by the enemy. The US imperialists, who are aggressive by nature, disregarding the Chinese people's resistance and warnings, have burned the flames of aggression against Korea to our border while the old blood debts have not yet been repaid. Moreover, they have sent planes to invade our airspace and strafe our compatriots, adding a new blood debt that has aroused the indignation of the people of the whole country. We know that to defend our existing achievements, to consolidate our existing victories, and to continue to redouble our efforts, we must win one victory after another on the production front and on the national defense front. Although the US imperialist aggressor troops are brutal, we are not afraid. In the face of the heroic and good-fighting Chinese people, they have only one way out - to be cannon fodder. Now, the US imperialists are nearing their death and are becoming more and more ferocious. Our workers should follow Chairman Mao's instructions: 'Build a strong economic force and national defense force,' step up production, complete the important task of supporting the front line, and give the US military approaching the northeast border a head-on blow. If they are stubborn to the end, they will be doomed to destruction."

宋春化 (Song Chunhua)
Song Chunhua, a worker at the Tianjin Paper Mill and a representative of Tianjin's labor models to the National Labor Model Representative Conference, said: After seeing the news published in the newspaper that Foreign Minister Zhou once again filed a complaint with the United Nations, I am even more indignant at the US imperialists' barbaric acts of invading our airspace and invading Korea. We Chinese people cannot be intimidated. We must step up production, consolidate national defense, and defend our motherland. The Chinese people have stood up and have the strength to smash the US imperialists' aggression. The US imperialists, who are strong in appearance but weak in reality, will definitely follow the path of Japanese imperialism and suffer a faster and more thorough defeat.

李墨林 (Li Molin)
Li Molin, a labor model representative attending the National Labor Model Conference, said: The US imperialists' conspiracy of aggression has been clearly exposed. In order to defend peace in the Far East and the world, it is absolutely necessary to support the Korean people's war of liberation. We should respond to Chairman Mao's call at the Labor Model Congress and resolutely complete the two major tasks that Chairman Mao has given us. Although we oppose war, we are not afraid of war. If the US imperialists expand the war of aggression like mad dogs, we are confident that we can make them perish sooner.

王德山 (Wang Deshan)
Labor model representative Wang Deshan said: When I was attending the meeting in Beijing, Chairman Mao gave us two major tasks: to build a strong national defense force and to build a strong economic force. Now that US imperialism is about to invade our territory, we workers in factories must use all our strength to actively produce, consolidate national defense, support the Korean people's war of patriotism, and smash the US imperialists' delusion of enslaving Asia.

姜振元 (Jiang Zhenyuan)
Jiang Zhenyuan, a representative of the De County Works Section of the Tianjin Railway Bureau and attending the National Labor Model Representative Conference, said: The US military invading Korea is advancing towards my northeast border, seriously threatening our country's security. The US imperialists do not want us to be free and democratic. But we are not afraid. The strong power of the people of the whole country will surely defeat the invading US military. Now I am working on researching a steel rail straightener, and the test results are very good. I want to use inventions to enhance railway transportation to strengthen national defense and economic construction.

李永 (Li Yong)
Li Yong, a hero of the Mao Zedong locomotive of the Tianjin Railway Bureau and a representative to the National Labor Model Congress, said: If the US imperialists risk expanding the war of aggression and invade our sacred border, the Chinese people who have stood up will definitely give the invaders a fatal blow. Our railway workers must use practical actions to improve transportation efficiency to show our determination and strength to defend the motherland and world peace. I call on all locomotive groups on the railway to launch an over-axis movement to strive for over-axis, more hauling and fast running, both stable and fast. Make railway transportation a strong pillar of national defense.

李兆珍 (Li Zhaozhen)
Li Zhaozhen, a female worker at the Tianjin Clothing Fourth Branch Factory, said: The US imperialists, disregarding the Chinese people's opposition and warnings, have frantically expanded the flames of war to the northeastern border of our country. After hearing this news, we are even more angry and resentful. We have a brotherly friendship with the Korean people, and we must help the Korean people. We defend world peace, but we are not afraid of war. We must dedicate our greatest strength to our work, follow Chairman Mao's instructions to "build a strong national defense force and a strong economic force," guarantee the timely supply of military uniforms for the commanders and fighters on the front line, and resolutely eliminate the US imperialist aggression.

陈典衡 (Chen Dianheng)
Chen Dianheng, a representative of the Tianjin Telecommunications Bureau attending the National Congress of Labor, Peasants and Soldiers, said: The US imperialists, disregarding the opposition of our people and the warnings of our government, have frantically and repeatedly violated our airspace, shot and killed our compatriots, and advanced towards our northeastern border, fully exposing their true colors of aggression. The people of our country love peace, but the US imperialists' reckless aggression cannot be allowed. The people of the whole country are sharpening their fists and preparing to fight against the shameless aggressor, US imperialism. Now we are determined to take the practical action of completing the 1950 construction plan ahead of schedule to oppose the US imperialists' aggression.

魏振华 (Wei Zhenhua)
Labor model Wei Zhenhua said: Seeing the news in the newspaper that the US imperialist army invading Korea was advancing towards our northeast border, I felt extremely angry. The US imperialists' blatant act of aggression is really intolerable to us Chinese people! I will definitely further unite the masses, study technology, actively produce, and use all our strength to support the People's Liberation Army, consolidate national defense, and aid the Korean people's revolutionary war to smash the US imperialist aggression.

钱嘉光 (Qian Jiaguang)
Labor model Qian Jiaguang said: The US imperialists have expanded the war of aggression, and their robber face has been completely exposed. We are determined to transform our resentment into strength, stand at our production posts, step up production, save raw materials, offer more rationalization proposals, create more new records, and increase national wealth. Protest against the US imperialists' aggression with practical actions. The territorial sovereignty of our country must not be infringed upon by the US imperialists. If the US imperialists dare to expand the war of aggression, we will wipe them out without hesitation.

　　天津市劳动模范纷纷发表谈话
    建设强大经济力量抗美援朝
    【本报讯】据天津日报消息：津市出席全国劳模代表会议代表纷纷发表谈话，反对美帝扩大侵略战争为将战火燃烧至中国边境。并表示要加紧生产建设，尽最大的力量支援朝鲜人民的爱国战争。
    潘长有
    出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议的劳动模范潘长有说：“神圣的国土是不允许敌人侵犯的，和平的建设事业是不能让敌人破坏的。侵略成性的美帝，不顾中国人民的反抗和警告，在旧的血债还没有偿还的今天，又将侵略朝鲜的火焰，燃烧到我国的边疆，而且，派遣飞机侵入我国领空，扫射我国同胞，加添一笔引起全国人民愤恨的新血债。我们知道：要保卫我们已有的成就，要巩固我们已有的胜利，还要继续加倍努力，在生产战线上，在国防战线上，要一个胜仗接着一个胜仗的打下去。美帝的侵略军虽然残暴，我们不怕，在英勇善战的中国人民面前，它们只有一条出路——当炮灰。现在，美帝是临近死期，越来越凶残了，咱们工人应该遵照毛主席的指示：“建设强大的经济力量和国防力量”，加紧生产，完成支援前线的重大任务，给予逼近东北边境的美军当头一棒。假如它们至死不悟，就是自取灭亡。”
    宋春化
    出席全国劳模代表会议的津市劳模代表、天津纸厂工人宋春化说：见到报纸上发表周外长再向联合国控诉的消息后，我对美帝侵犯我国领空，侵略朝鲜的野蛮行动更加愤恨。我们中国人民是吓不倒的，我们要加紧生产，巩固国防，保卫祖国。中国人民已经站立起来，有力量粉碎美帝的侵略，外强中干的美帝，一定要走上日本帝国主义的道路，遭到更快更彻底的失败。
    李墨林
    出席全国劳模会议的劳模代表李墨林说：美帝的侵略阴谋，已经很明显的暴露出来了。为了保卫远东和全世界的和平，支援朝鲜人民的解放战争是完全必要的。我们应该响应毛主席在劳模大会上的号召，坚决完成毛主席给我们的两大任务。咱们虽然反对战争，但是咱们并不怕战争，美帝真以疯狗似的疯狂扩大侵略战争，我们有把握叫他早一天灭亡。
    王德山
    劳模代表王德山说：在北京开会的时候，毛主席指示给我们两大任务：建设强大的国防军；建设强大的经济力量。现在美帝国主义快侵略到我们的国土上来了，咱们在工厂作工的工人，要拿出所有的力量积极生产，巩固国防，支援朝鲜人民的爱国战争，粉碎美帝奴役亚洲的妄想。
    姜振元
    天津铁路局德县工务段、出席全国劳模代表会议代表姜振元说：侵朝美军向我东北边境推近，严重威胁着我国的安全。美帝不愿意我们自由民主。但是我们不怕。全国人民的强大力量，一定可以把侵略的美军打败，现在我正致力于研究钢轨矫正器，试验结果很好，我要以创造发明来增强铁路运输，以加强国防力量和经济建设。
    李永
    出席全国劳模代表大会代表、天津铁路局毛泽东号司机李永英雄说：美帝如果冒险扩大侵略战争、侵犯我国神圣的边疆，站起来了的中国人民一定给予侵略者以致命打击。我们铁路职工，要用提高运输效能的实际行动来显示我们捍卫祖国和世界和平的决心和力量。我号召全路机车组展开超轴运动，争取超轴、多拉快跑、既稳且快。使铁路运输成为国防力量的一个强大支柱。
    李兆珍
    天津被服第四分厂女工李兆珍说：美帝国主义不顾中国人民的反对和警告，疯狂地把战争火焰扩大至我国东北边境，我们听到这个消息以后，更加愤怒和痛恨，我们和朝鲜人民是有着兄弟般的友谊，我们一定要援助朝鲜人民。我们保卫世界和平，但也不惧怕战争，我们一定要在工作中献出我们最大的力量来，遵照毛主席的指示“建设强大的国防力量，建设强大的经济力量”，保证及时供给前方指战员们穿上军衣，坚决消灭美帝侵略。
    陈典衡
    天津电信局出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议的代表陈典衡说：美帝不顾我国人民的反对和我政府的警告，竟疯狂的屡次侵犯我领空，射杀我同胞，并向我东北边境推进，充分暴露侵略的真面目。我国人民热爱和平，但美帝这样不顾一切的侵略，是不能允许的，全国人民都在磨拳擦掌，准备向无耻的侵略者美帝进行斗争。现在我们决以提前完成一九五○年建设计划的实际行动，来反对美帝的侵略行为。
    魏振华
    劳模魏振华说：看到报纸上登出美帝侵朝军队向我国东北边疆推进的消息，我心中异常愤恨，美帝这种露骨的侵略行为，实在叫我们中国人民不能容忍！我一定在生产岗位上更进一步团结群众、钻研技术、积极生产，用一切力量支援人民解放军，巩固国防，并援助朝鲜人民革命战争，粉碎美帝侵略。”
    钱嘉光
    劳模钱嘉光说：美帝扩大侵略战争，强盗的面目已完全暴露出来了。我们决化愤恨为力量，站在生产岗位上，加紧生产，节约原料，多提合理化建议，多创新纪录，增加国家财富。以实际行动抗议美帝的侵略行为，我国的领土主权决不许美帝侵犯。如果美帝敢于扩大侵略战争，我们就毫不客气的把它消灭干净。
