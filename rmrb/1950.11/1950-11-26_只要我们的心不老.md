　　As Long as Our Hearts Don't Age
    By Liebiejiefu—Kumakechi, jointly translated by Qiu Qin and Liu Guangjie
    Dear ones, it's alright, it's alright…
    Let the white hair and frost grow at the temples—
    To protect our hearts,
    This is the white salt powder that the war sprinkled on us.
　
    No matter who it was that on our black hair
    Sprinkled a handful of white salt powder—
    We will become stronger! Whether it be storms, or suffering,
    Nothing can conquer us.
　
    To grieve for every wrinkle,
    This reason I really cannot pursue:
    Please think, that a true man
    Does not bear deep wrinkles from the war!
　
    These past years, in order to live in the world,
    We have tasted bitterness, but also joy.
    At the time of parting, we thought of reunion,
    In the darkness, we remembered the sun.
　
    Happiness will soon arrive: that rosy sunset glow,
    And that nightingale's melodious song…
    As long as our hearts don't age,
    As long as our souls don't grow wrinkles!
    (Translator's note: This poem was written during the Soviet Great Patriotic War and is included in the author's collection of poems "Poems and Songs." This collection is included in the "Mars" series, published by the Truth Publishing House in 1947.)

　　只要我们的心不老
    列别节夫—库玛赤作  丘琴刘光杰合译
    亲爱的，不要紧，不要紧……
    就让那白发霜生在两鬓——
    为了保护我们的心，
    这是战争给我们撒上的白盐粉。
　
    不管它是谁在我们的黑发上
    撒下了一把白盐粉——
    我们会变得更坚强！无论是风暴，苦痛，
    任什么也不能征服我们。
　
    为了每一条绉纹而忧伤，
    这理由我实在无法追寻：
    请想想吧，那一个真正的男人
    不带有战争里来的深深的绉纹！
　
    这几年，为了生活在世上，
    我们尝过了苦难，可也有欢畅。
    在别离时我们想着重逢，
    在黑暗中我们记得太阳。
　
    幸福就将到临：那玫瑰色的晚霞，
    和那夜莺的婉转歌声……
    只要我们的心不老，
    只要我们的灵魂不起绉纹！
