　　The People's Demand for Justice
　　Professor of Chinese Department, Peking University, Yang Hui
　　On November 10th, nine newspaper offices in Shanghai issued a joint statement: American film advertisements will be suspended from today. Then, on the 12th, the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao published the following news: "Now, the preparatory committee of the Shanghai Cinema Commercial Association, in order to meet the people's just demands, has issued a notice deciding that the industry association will voluntarily stop showing American films from the 14th of this month." I think this fact will shock the American imperialists as much as the discovery of Chinese volunteers on the battlefield in North Korea.

　　The American robber has always played a two-faced policy of aggression against China: one side is smiling, as if very civilized, this is the cultural aggression side; the other side is very fierce and very domineering, this is the trinity of imperialist political, economic and military aggression. In short, although the civilian and military affairs are sometimes different, aggression is always the same. Therefore, the history of Sino-US relations is a history of American aggression against China. Only because there are differences between cultural and military aggression in the middle, many people think that cultural aggression is not aggression, and even offset military aggression. Isn't this a big fool? However, we have been fooled all these years, not to mention the traitors, even the patriots are inevitable!
　　Older people probably still remember the anti-American goods movement that was launched in 1905. This was a movement initiated by the Shanghai business community because of American discrimination against Chinese, and many large cities responded. As a result, although it was suppressed by Yuan Shikai, it was like a head-on blow to the American imperialists. In 1908, the US Congress passed the return of a portion of the "Boxer Indemnity" to establish preparatory schools for studying in the United States. This is very clear: the so-called "Boxer Indemnity" is the loot that the American robbers looted from China, but turned around and used it as capital to make Chinese intellectuals pro-American and worship the United States. It is really a win-win situation. This is the basis for Dr. Hu Shih's strategy of attacking the mind of Japanese imperialism. His own heart was captured by American imperialism in this way.
　　The Eight-Power Allied Forces, in 1900, although they captured Beijing and extorted a large sum of indemnity; however, the clever imperialists, especially the missionaries of the imperialist vanguard, learned from the Boxer Rebellion and confirmed that the Church's aggression policy was difficult to achieve the desired results. Therefore, the proposal of the United States to use China's indemnity to run preparatory schools for studying in the United States and absorb a large number of students to go to the United States for education came from a teacher who had been preaching in China for many years. Therefore, under the double-pronged policy of American cultural aggression, education plus religion, Stuart Leighton, the American Doihara, an old fox with a thousand years of Taoism, has emerged. Now, he no longer needs to hide his head and tail to pretend to be a good friend of the Chinese people, and openly directs a group of agents to carry out destructive activities against China.
　　Coincidentally, in 1909, the second year after the refund of indemnity to run schools, American imperialism opened up the film market in China soon after invading our education. In the first ten years, or twenty years, it almost monopolized our film market. The power of American films, although China's own national film industry has risen, is still very rampant. Although the economic loss to China is great, it can still be estimated; as for the cultural harm, it is impossible to measure.

　　"When the map is unrolled, the dagger appears." This idiom can be borrowed to describe the tricks of American imperialism against China. You look at it for a long time and think it is just a map, but in fact there is a dagger hidden in the middle. When the US imperialist policy toward China cannot play a role, that is, when it cannot achieve the expected goal, the military aggression policy that has been threatening you has been taken out long ago. However, we have been anesthetized by the cultural policy of the United States for a long time, and there are many people who insist on treating a slap in the face as not a slap in the face. These people always feel that the United States will slap us? The United States is civilized and will not slap us! Many people deceive themselves in this way. You think, the imperialists who threaten world peace with atomic bombs all day long are not trying to slap you, but also to scare you so that you dare not fight back, so what else are they for? This kind of imperialism is not only a robber, but also a liar. When the mask of the hypocrite is揭 open, it reveals the face of a villain without any politeness. At this time, those who have been fooled in the past will also wake up, not to mention that some people are exposing its truth and raising the vigilance of our Chinese people. Just look at the declaration issued by the faculty and staff of Yenching University: "People at Yenching University have always been vigilant about the cultural aggression methods of the US imperialists. Today, the US imperialists tear off the fraudulent and hypocritical mask they used to use and openly carry out military aggression. It is precisely to let all the people of our country and the people of the world (including the majority of American people who love peace) recognize the ferocious face of imperialism more clearly, and promote our determination and action to oppose aggression, defend world peace, and completely eliminate war mongers." (People's Daily, November 8) This, at least, I think can make Stuart Leighton tremble, and it is enough to prove that although it is cultural aggression, the aggression policy will eventually go bankrupt. In fact, at the end of the Chiang Kai-shek dynasty, the "new road" planned by Ambassador Stuart Leighton made it clear that he placed his hopes on a group of Chinese intellectuals who had studied in the United States and held liberal ideas. As a result, it was still "this road is blocked." Except for a very small number of people who are willing to be running dogs of imperialism, such as Hu Shih and Chiang Ting-fu, perhaps some were confused for a while, but soon they understood and refused to be fooled. Therefore, today, this idol of American imperialism, even among some intellectuals who usually admire the United States, that is, in the minds of the kind of democratic individualists expected in Acheson's White Paper last year, has been broken and cannot maintain a complete and solemn image. However, there are still people who cherish the broken idol and are reluctant to throw it into the trash can, and who cherish the idea of "cherishing one's own broom."
　　There is a saying popular in my hometown that "a thief bites a mouthful, and it goes into the bone three points." "Thief bites" should be transformed from "dog bites", but in short, even if it is just a mouthful, being bitten is not a light matter. Imperialism has been invading China for a hundred years, not to mention that the cultural aggression of the United States has caused such deep harm to China that it is not difficult to imagine. Since the May Fourth Movement, there has been a serious revolutionary movement against imperialism and feudalism for thirty years, which almost put American imperialism as an exception among the imperialisms to be opposed. However, didn't someone say: "Who laughs last, who is the one who really laughs"? To paraphrase it: Who is the last one to be overthrown, who is the one who is overthrown most thoroughly. Especially the imperialist aggression in China. In this movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, it is precisely an opportunity to completely eliminate all the influence of US imperialism's aggression against China. Mencius didn't say: "The blessings of the petty people will be cut off after five generations"? If we let it go, the remaining blessings of the US imperialist cultural aggression against China will probably be spread unconsciously. There are now quite a few accusations against the atrocities of the US imperialists in China. Even if it is a trivial matter, we must intentionally do a cleaning job for the poisonous American culture. Naturally, the most important thing is to expose the reactionary and fascist nature of American culture, and the compradore consciousness that has been deeply infiltrated in our intellectual circles. Mr. Dong Weichuan said it well in "An Educational Plan of the US Imperialist Conspiracy to Control China": "...The American imperialists' means of aggression are particularly clever, and they can be far-sighted, so that Chinese intellectuals, due to their various methods of absorption and co-optation, mostly develop a good impression of them; not only develop a good impression, but also some people used to think that transporting American education was a skill. For thirty years, all American educational systems, curricula, methods, and even philosophies have been completely moved over, so that many educated people in China have gradually become Americanized in their thinking, consciousness, and actions. ...Therefore, almost every intellectual in China has more or less directly or indirectly received the influence of American imperialist culture and education." (Guangming Daily, November 14) Our new democratic revolution has basically succeeded, and in the new democratic cultural construction, the influence of American imperialist culture is no longer allowed to exist. The time has come to uproot this imperialist culture with its roots and leaves. "In terms of thinking, consciousness, and actions," the "many educated people in China" who were "gradually Americanized" in the past, today, when "the US imperialists tear off the fraudulent and hypocritical mask they used to use and openly carry out military aggression," it is also time to finally eliminate the remaining poison of past Americanization and completely eliminate the pro-American and American-worshiping ideology. Today, it is time for every intellectual in China who "has more or less, directly or indirectly received the influence of American imperialist culture and education" to completely abandon illusions about American imperialism, and to no longer allow American imperialists to harbor illusions about any intellectual. The suspension of American film advertisements by the nine newspaper offices in Shanghai and the suspension of American film screenings by the Shanghai cinemas are all expressions to meet the just demands of our Chinese people, and also proofs that American imperialist cultural aggression has finally been eliminated in China. Among our intellectuals, if there are still remnants of pro-American and American-worshiping thoughts that have not been eliminated, we must put forward the "people's just demands." In the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend our country, which has already entered the stage of voluntary action, isn't it the most solemn "just demand" to eliminate the remaining pro-American and American-worshiping thoughts?

　　人民的正义要求
    北大中文系教授  杨晦
    十一月十日，上海有九家报馆发表联合声明：即日停登美国影片广告。接着在十二日，上海大公报上就发表了：“现在上海市电影院商业同业公会筹备会为了符合人民的正义要求，已发表启事，决定自本月十四日起该会同业自动停映美国影片”的这样消息。我想，这个事实对于美国帝国主义者，会跟在北朝鲜的战场上发现了中国的志愿军，同样地感到震惊的吧。

    美国这个强盗，对中国的侵略向来是玩的两面政策：一面是笑嘻嘻，仿佛很文明的样子，这是文化侵略的一面；另一面却十分凶恶，十分霸道，这是帝国主义政治经济和军事侵略三位一体的另一面。总而言之，文武虽然有时不同，侵略却是始终如一的。所以，说起中美关系的历史就是一部美国侵略中国的历史。只因为这中间有着文侵武侵的不同，有许多人就以为文侵不是侵略，甚至于就把武侵都给抵消了。这不是上了大当吗？然而，我们这些年来就是这样一直上当来的，汉奸不论吧，连爱国之士都难免！
    年纪大一点的人，大概都还记得在一九○五年，曾掀起过一次抵制美货运动。这是因为美国的排华，由上海商界发动，许多大都市都响应了的一次运动，结果，虽然被袁世凯给镇压下去了，却给美帝国主义者正好像当头一棒。在一九○八年，美国国会通过了退还“庚子赔款”的一部分，创办留美预备学校。这是很分明的：所谓“庚子赔款”，是美国强盗从中国抢劫去的赃款，却反转过来，做为使中国知识分子亲美崇美的资本，实在是名利双收，最为上算。这就是后来胡适博士对日本帝国主义献攻心之策的根据，他自己的心就是这样被美国帝国主义攻下的。
    八国联军，在一九○○年，虽然攻下了北京，并且敲诈到手一笔极大数目的赔款；但是，在聪明的帝国主义者，特别是帝国主义的先锋队传教士们，由于义和团的教训，证实教会的侵略政策很难收到预期的效果了。所以，美国拿中国的赔款，办理留美预备学校，吸收大批学生到美国去受教育的提议，是出之于一位在中国传教多年的教师。因此，就在美国对华文化侵略，教育加宗教的双管齐下政策下，才产生出司徒雷登，这位美国的土肥原，足有千年道行的老狐精，现在，已经是原形毕现，用不着再藏头露尾地冒充中国人的好朋友，公开在那里指挥一群特务，进行对中国无恶不作的破坏行动了。
    恰巧，就在一九○九年，在退赔款办学校的第二年，美国帝国主义在侵到我们的教育事业后不久就在中国开辟了电影市场。这在开头的十年，或者说是二十年吧，差不多是独霸了我们的电影市场。美国电影的势力，虽然在中国自己的民族电影制片事业已经兴起以后，依然是非常猖獗。这对中国经济上的损失虽然大，还是可以估计的；至于在文化方面的毒害，就无法计量了。

    “图穷而匕首现”。这句成语正好可以借用来形容美帝国主义对华的伎俩的。你看了半天，以为他只是一张图，实在这中间藏着一把匕首。美帝的对华文化政策，到了不能发挥作用，就是不能达预期目的的时候，早在那里威胁着你的军事侵略政策就拿出来了。不过，我们被美帝的文化政策麻醉已久，硬把打耳光当做并非打耳光的都有许多人，在这些人总觉得美国会打我们耳光吗？美国是文明的，不会打我们的耳光！有许多人在这样欺骗自己。你想，整天拿原子弹在威胁世界和平的帝国主义，不是为的打你的耳光，而且要吓的你不敢还手，那还为的什么？这种帝国主义，不但是强盗，而且是骗子，等到伪君子的面幕一揭开，就露出其小人的嘴脸来，丝毫没有客气。这时候，过去上当的受骗的也会觉悟过来，何况真有人在那里揭穿它的真相，提高我们中国人民的警觉。就看燕大教职员工所发的宣言吧：“我们燕大的人一向警惕美帝的文化侵略手段，今天美帝撕破惯用的欺诈虚伪的假面具，而公开进行军事侵略，正是让我们全国人民和世界人民（连美国爱好和平的大部分人民在内）更认清楚帝国主义的凶恶面貌，并且促进我们反对侵略，保卫世界和平，彻底消灭战争贩子的决心和行动。”（十一月八日人民日报）这，至少，我想可以叫司徒雷登发抖的，也足以证明虽然是文化侵略，而侵略政策终于是要破产的。其实，在蒋介石王朝的末日，正由这位司徒雷登大使所策动的“新路”，说明白是把希望寄放在一部分曾在美留学，怀抱自由主义的中国知识分子身上，结果还是“此路不通”，除掉极少数甘心给帝国主义作走狗的如胡适、蒋廷黻之流，也许有的迷惑了一下，不久也就明白过来，不肯上当。所以，到今天，美帝国主义这个偶像，就在平常亲美崇美的一部分知识分子中间，也就是在去年艾奇逊的白皮书里所属望的民主个人主义者一类人的心目中，也已经残破，无法保持一个完整的、庄严的形象。然而，拿这个残破的偶像依然就舍不得丢到垃圾箱里去，颇存“敝帚自珍”那样痴想的人却也未尝没有。
    我们家乡流行一句“贼咬一口，入骨三分”的话，“贼咬”应该是由“狗咬”转用过来的吧，不过，总是：那怕只是一口，一被咬就是不轻的意思。帝国主义侵略中国已经有一百年之久，何况美帝这样的文化侵略，中国受害之深，是不难想像的。自从五四运动以来，正经有三十年的反帝反封建的革命运动，几乎把美帝国主义放在被反的帝国主义的例外。然而，不是有人说：谁是最后笑的，谁是真正笑的人那样话吗？套句调：谁是最后被打倒的，谁就是被打倒得最彻底的一个。特别是帝国主义在中国的侵略。我们在这次的抗美援朝运动里边，正是彻底消灭美帝对中国侵略的一切影响的机会。孟子不说过：“小人之泽也五世而斩”吗？假使要任其自然，美帝对中国文化侵略的余泽，恐怕也会不自觉地流传下去的。现在控诉美帝在中国的暴行的正经不少。那怕是枝枝节节的呢，也要有意地把美国文化流毒，做一种扫除的工作。自然，最重要的是揭发美国文化的反动性质，法西斯性质；在我们知识界里已经浸入很深的买办意识。董渭川先生在《美帝阴谋控制中国的一个教育计划》里说得很好：“……美帝国主义者的侵略手段特别巧妙，并且能深谋远虑，使中国的知识分子，由于其各种方法吸收笼络，大多数对之发生好感；不仅发生好感，并且曾经有些人以为搬运美国的教育为能事，三十年来，举凡美国的教育制度，课程，方法以至哲学等等，全盘搬过来了，使中国许多受过教育的人，在思想意识上，生活行动上，逐渐美国化了。……所以，中国几乎每一个知识分子都或多或少地，直接间接地受过了美帝文化教育的薰陶。”（十一月十四日光明日报）我们的新民主主义革命运动基本上已经成功，在新民主主义的文化建设里边，已经不容许再有美帝国主义文化的影响存在。这种帝国主义文化是要连根带叶一齐拔掉的时候到来了。“在思想意识上，生活行动上”，过去曾经“逐渐美国化”的“中国许多受过教育的人”，在“美帝撕破惯用的欺诈虚伪的假面具，而公开进行军事侵略”的今天，也到了最后肃清过去美国化的余毒，彻底消灭亲美崇美的思想意识的时候了。今天是中国“或多或少地，直接间接地受过了美帝文化教育的薰陶”的每一个知识分子都对美帝国主义完全丢掉幻想，也不要再使美帝国主义者在任何一个知识分子身上存幻想的时候。我们上海的九家报馆的停登美国影片广告，上海电影院的停映美国影片，都是为了符合我们中国人民的正义要求的表示，也是美帝文化侵略最后在中国被肃清的证明。我们知识分子里，假使还有亲美崇美的思想残余，没有肃清，我们要提出“人民的正义要求”。在抗美援朝保家卫国的运动已经进入志愿的行动的今天，难道说，要肃清残存的亲美崇美思想，还不是最庄严的“正义要求”吗？
