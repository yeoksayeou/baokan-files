　　The Reality of Living in New York Slums
　　Professor of Peking University Han Shouxuan
　　In the People's Daily on November 12th, Comrade Gornev's article from the Soviet Union was reprinted, pointing out the heavy oppression suffered by the American people and exposing the hypocrisy and dark secrets of American imperialism's boasting about democracy and freedom. At the same time, it tells us that American imperialism has no concern for the living conditions of the working people. The eight million houses in the slums are so dilapidated that they cannot be repaired any further. Inspired by this great article, I will introduce the reality of living in New York slums, based on what I have heard and seen, as follows.
　　New York is the most prosperous city in the United States, but its southeastern district is the home of poor working masses. The living conditions in this area can be roughly divided into four types.
　　1. Train-like dwellings: In this type of dwelling, there are five or six households on each floor. However, except for the two households at the very front and the very back, the rest are confined inside without windows, never seeing the light of day all year round, never breathing fresh air, and living in such a dark hell for years. As for the two households with windows, the capitalists will certainly not let them off easily and will definitely extract more rent. The stairs in these types of houses are dilapidated and extremely dangerous; we are somewhat afraid to go up them.
　　2. Hot beds: Working people who do not have the money to rent the above-mentioned dwellings have to rent a bed to sleep in. However, the capitalists, who are meticulous in their exploitation, are able to calculate carefully, dividing one bed among three people, each sleeping for eight hours, exploiting others at all times within twenty-four hours. Because there are often people sleeping in the bed, it is called a hot bed. I remember asking about the rental price at the time; it was about 25 cents per eight hours of sleep.
　　3. Passageways: How do the poor people who cannot afford to rent a hot bed solve the problem of sleeping? They can only rent a passageway to sleep in at these hotels with hot beds, which means sleeping on the floor outside the door. The cruel capitalists are not willing to let go of such passageways, nor do they allow free sleeping; they still demand rent before allowing people to spend the night.
　　4. Rotten newspaper piles: According to a report from a slum social worker, those who do not have the money to rent a passageway pile up rotten newspapers in a corner of the street and bury themselves in the newspaper pile to keep warm and pass the night. When the weather is warm, the parks become their residence, but they are often interfered with by the police.
　　Similar situations exist in major cities like New York. Even in the capital of American imperialism, the dwellings of the poor masses are just as bad. The material civilization of the United States is entirely created by the working masses, but it is completely controlled by the Wall Street financial groups. In order to obtain their own profits and raise domestic market prices, they burned wheat and cotton, and threw milk and apples into the sea. Therefore, the general working masses can only live a life of hunger and cold. And the conditions of various dwellings are ironclad evidence of the crimes of the Wall Street financial groups.
　　The Wall Street financial groups not only cruelly oppress and exploit the working masses in their own country, but they also have wolfish ambitions to exploit the people of Asia and the world in the same way. This time, the expansion of aggression by American imperialism, threatening our motherland, is a step in their attempt.

### 纽约贫民窟居住的实况

　　纽约贫民窟居住的实况
    北大教授  韩寿萱
    在十一月十二日人民日报上转载了苏联高尔涅夫同志的一篇文章，指出美国人民所遭受的重重压迫，揭穿美帝以民主自由自夸的虚伪和黑幕，同时告诉我们：美帝对于劳动人民的居住条件是没有的。而贫民窟的八百万处房屋，都破烂到不能再修理的程度。因为这篇大文的启发，我将纽约贫民窟的居住实况，据闻见所及，介绍于下。
    纽约是美国最繁华的一个大城，但它的东南区却是贫苦劳动大众的住所，这区的居住情况，大略有四种。
    一、火车式的住处：这种住处就是每一层楼上，住户有五、六家。但是除了最前和最后的两家外，其余的几家都是关在里边，并没有窗子，一年四季见不着天日，永远吸不到新鲜空气，成年是在这样的黑暗地狱里生活着，至于那两家有窗子的住户，资本家当然不会放松，一定要榨取较多的房租。这类房屋的楼梯都是破烂不堪，危险之至，我们都有点不敢上去。
    二、热床：没有钱租赁上述住处的劳动人民，只好租床睡睡，但是剥削无微不至的资本家是能精打细算，将一只床分租给三个人睡，每人睡八小时，在二十四小时内无时不在剥削他人，因为常常有人睡在床上，就叫做热床。记得当时曾问过租价，大概每睡八小时是美金二角五分。
    三、过道：租不起热床的贫苦人民怎样解决睡的问题，只有在这种具有热床的旅馆里，租过道来睡，那就是睡在门外的地板上。对这样的过道凶残的资本家也不肯轻放，也不让白住，依然要勒索租金，才许度夜。
    四、烂报堆：据一位贫民窟社会服务者的报告，没有钱租过道的穷苦者，就在街头的一角，堆积起烂报纸，自埋在报纸堆里，取暖消夜。至于天暖时公园便是他们的住处，但常受到警察的干涉。
    类似纽约的情形各大城市都有，就是在美帝的首都，贫苦大众的住处也是一样的糟。美国的物质文明完全由劳动大众创造出来，但这一切完全由华尔街的财阀统治。他们为了取得自己的利润，提高本国的市价，将麦子和棉花烧了，牛乳和苹果扔到海里去，因此一般劳动大众便不能不过着饥寒交迫的生活。而各种住处的情况就是华尔街财阀罪状的铁证。
    华尔街的财阀不只是在他们国内凶残地压迫和剥削劳动大众，他们狼子野心，还妄想同样地来剥削亚洲和全世界的人民。这次美帝扩大侵略，威胁我们的祖国，便是他们这样企图的一个步骤。
