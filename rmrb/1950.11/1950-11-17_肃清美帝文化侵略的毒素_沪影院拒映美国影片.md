　　Eradicate the Poisonous Influence of American Imperialist Cultural Aggression
    Shanghai Cinemas Refuse to Show American Films
    [This Newspaper News] According to Xinhua News Agency reports: All forty cinemas in Shanghai, accepting the demands of the broad masses of the audience, unanimously refused to show American films starting from November 14th. Before liberation, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, American films almost controlled all the cinemas in Shanghai, while domestically produced films were restricted from being shown. American films in our country not only spread the poisonous influence of American imperialist cultural aggression but also carried out enormous economic plunder. Eight major American film companies, such as "MGM," "Paramount," and "Columbia," through their poisonous films, swindled approximately six million US dollars annually from the people of Shanghai. After the liberation of Shanghai, with the increasing political awareness of the broad masses of people, the reactionary films of American imperialism have been gradually discarded by the people. In April 1949, the total number of viewers of American films in Shanghai was 1,027,596. However, more than a year after the liberation of Shanghai, by September 1950, the number of viewers of American films in Shanghai had dropped to 270,417. After the upsurge of the nationwide campaign to resist America, aid Korea, and defend the country, all forty cinemas in Shanghai, accepting the demands of people from all walks of life, have refused to show American films since the 14th.

　　肃清美帝文化侵略的毒素
    沪影院拒映美国影片
    【本报讯】据新华社消息：上海全市四十家电影院，接受广大观众要求，于十一月十四日起一律拒映美国影片。解放前，在国民党反动统治下，美国影片几乎控制了上海全部电影院，国产片反被限制上映。美国影片在我国一面传播美帝国主义文化侵略的毒素，同时进行巨大的经济掠夺。“米高梅”、“派拉蒙”、“哥伦比亚”等八大美国影片公司通过他们的有毒素的电影，每年从上海人民的手中骗取美金六百万元左右。上海解放后随着广大人民政治觉悟的日益提高，美帝国主义的反动影片已逐渐为人民唾弃。一九四九年四月份上海美国影片的观众总数为一百零二万七千五百九十六人。但在上海解放一年多以后，至一九五零年九月份上海美国影片的观众已降至二十七万零四百十七人。在全市人民掀起抗美援朝保家卫国热潮后，全市四十家电影院接受各界人民要求，自十四日起拒映美国影片。
