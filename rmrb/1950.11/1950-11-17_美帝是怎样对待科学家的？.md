How Does U.S. Imperialism Treat Scientists?
Professor of Mathematics, Tsinghua University, Hua Luogeng

In the 1920s and 30s, due to Hitler's brutality, many German scientists, in order to escape the clutches of the Nazi devil, and to passively resist the fascist regime, fled to this vast world to seek a new environment in which to work. At that time, the wounds of many European countries after the First World War had not yet healed, while the United States of America was not damaged or scorched by the war. On the contrary, the war brought her some prosperity, so these scientists rashly chose this "kingdom of gold," naively believing that this was a paradise where they could spend their lives and where they could develop their talents. Unfortunately, when the Second World War had just ended, what followed was the replacement of Hitler's slogan "Germany Above All Else" with "America First!" And the fruits of the scientists' hard work—atomic energy—were used by ambitious people as a tool to threaten human peace—the atomic bomb. In order to realize its dream of dominating the world, U.S. imperialism spared no effort to use various methods, threats, and inducements, attempting to force scientists to become servants of capitalists, engaging in research they disliked—research serving capitalists and warmongers. The persecution suffered by these scientists was no less than that given by Germany during Hitler's time.

In Oregon State University in the United States, there was a chemistry professor, Mr. Spitz. He saw the aimless criticism of Michurin-Lysenko science by the United States, and felt very much that this was not the attitude scientists should have. Therefore, he wrote a letter that was published in a chemistry magazine, very gently saying: "The attitude of scientists should be objective! It is unscientific to criticize other people's theories without understanding them, or even seeing their works!" Unexpectedly, such a letter would cause Mr. Spitz to be dismissed. Not only that, but the chemistry authority Professor Pauling also suffered a setback because of this matter. He wrote a letter to the president of the university about this matter, and finally said that if Oregon University continued to operate in this way, it would be disappointing and would lose the support of scholars! The president's reply was impolite, saying: "Without your support, let's see if I can run the university?" Now Mr. Spitz is still wandering in Europe. Examples like Mr. Spitz are just one of countless (the University of California once suspended more than 100 people for ideological issues).

The methods used by U.S. imperialism to lure scientists are extremely clever. They have a so-called "wartime work" program. The Navy and the Army are both engaged in this type of work. Scientists engaged in this work can receive an extra 40% to 60% allowance in addition to their regular salary at the school. In the beginning, they said: There is no need to change your work plan, continue to work according to the research you are currently engaged in, and only need to make two reports a year to explain the progress of the research. What sweet words, so attractive, but once you fall into the trap, you are forced tighter step by step: First, make some designations for your research direction, and then further, give you some special problems. Finally, use the excuse that "you have participated in national defense secrets" to make them lose their freedom of action! (The above words are entirely based on the facts I know. Because some of the parties involved are still "alive" in the United States, in order not to increase their troubles and difficulties, I will hide their names, places, and scope of work.)

During my attendance at the 250th anniversary of the German Academy of Sciences, I heard a message that Einstein had replied to the invitation of the anniversary, saying: "If I can get a passport, I will definitely come to participate!" But in the end, he did not participate!

Einstein's experiences in the United States can be seen from the following event: Around the end of last year, he published the "General Theory of Relativity," and some newspapers used large headlines to "praise" it greatly for a while. However, in February of this year, Einstein warned U.S. imperialism not to play with hydrogen bombs casually, which angered the capitalists because it exposed their dream of dominating the world. Therefore, they instructed the congressmen who represented the interests of the capitalists to speak out: "Einstein has made no contribution to atomic energy, and his leftist attitude should have been deported long ago!"

Why did the attitude of U.S. imperialist public opinion change so quickly in such a short period of time? The reason is very simple. Because American public opinion, generally speaking, represents the interests of the Wall Street bosses, and from the perspective of the bosses, scientists are just their employees! When the master can use the servant, he "praises" him, and when the servant's speech affects the master's interests, he will inevitably be accused!

The fate of ordinary scientists is like this, and the experiences of our Chinese scientists in the United States are even worse. Two months ago, the immigration bureau suddenly talked to a Chinese professor teaching in the United States and asked him to sign a document. The content of the document had the following four articles: ① Not a communist. ② Not a fellow traveler. ③ No relatives or friends who are communists. ④ Under the communist regime, I am unwilling to return to China. Such harsh conditions, the Chinese scientist of course could not sign. However, in order not to suffer immediate losses, he had to say euphemistically: "I can't sign this document because my mother is in China, and I will go back to see her sooner or later!" As a result, the U.S. Immigration Bureau asked him to choose one of the following three conditions: ① Detain him. ② Deport him. ③ Change jobs.

This is the self-proclaimed "scientifically advanced country!" This is the so-called American "freedom" and "democracy!" Scientists living here are not only denied the freedom to be human, but also denied the freedom to work—to do work they don't want to do! A scientific authority I met in Berlin this time said it well: "After the First World War, the United States became a refuge for German scientists. And now, after the Second World War, American scientists will be looking for another refuge!"

From the attitude of U.S. imperialism towards scientists, we can easily infer that its scientific development is going downhill! On the contrary, our scientists in the peaceful and democratic camp led by the Soviet Union, based on serving the people, have unlimited bright prospects for their development!

　　美帝是怎样对待科学家的？
    清华大学数学系教授  华罗庚
    在本世纪的二、三十年代，由于希特勒的残暴，很多的德国科学家们为了逃避希魔的毒手，为了消极地反抗法西斯的政权，跑到这茫茫的世界上，重新寻求可以工作的环境。那时正值第一次世界大战之后，欧洲许多国家的创伤尚未恢复，而当时的北美合众国，既未受到战争的破坏与灼伤，相反的，战争更为她带来了一些繁荣，所以这些科学家们就贸然地抉择了这“金圆王国”，满以为这是可以终老的乐园，这是可以发展自己所长的所在。但不幸的是，当第二次世界大战甫告结束，跟着而来的就是把希特勒的“德意志高于一切”的口号换成了“美国第一”！而科学家们辛勤劳动的成果——原子能，更被野心家们作为威胁人类和平的工具——原子弹。美帝为了完成它独霸世界的迷梦，更不惜用各种方法，威胁利诱，企图逼迫科学家成为资本家的仆从，从事他们所不喜欢的研究——为资本家及战争贩子们服务的研究。至于这批科学家所受到的迫害，是并不下于当年希特勒时期的德国所给予的。——
    在美国的奥勒冈州的州立大学里，有一位化学教授斯匹兹先生，他看见美国对米邱林李森科学说的无的放矢的批评，十分觉得这不是科学家应有的态度。因之，他写了一信登在化学杂志上，非常委婉地说：“科学家的态度是应当客观的！在没有了解人家的学说，甚至于没有见到人家的著作之前而下批评，是不科学的！”想不到这样的一封信，竟会使这位斯匹兹先生受到了解聘的处分。不仅如此，化学界的权威鲍林教授为这事也碰了一鼻子的灰，他为这事写了一信向该大学校长说项，最后说起，如果奥勒冈大学如此地办，是会使人失望的，是会失掉学者们的支持的！而该校长的回信竟无礼貌地说：“没有你的支持，看我能不能办大学？”现在斯匹兹先生还在欧洲流浪着。像斯先生这样的例子，只不过是无数中的一个而已（加尼福尼亚大学一次就为思想问题停聘一百多人）。
    美帝利诱科学家的方法是极为巧妙的，他们有一种所谓“战时工作”计划。海军部和陆军部都从事这一类的工作，凡从事于这项工作的科学家，可以在学校的正薪之外，再加百分之四十到六十的额外津贴。开始时，他们说：并不须要改变你的工作计划，一切照你现在所从事的研究继续工作，仅须每年做两次报告，说明研究的进展。真是甜言蜜语，引人入胜，但当你一旦入了圈套，就一步一步的迫紧：先是对你的研究方向，作若干的指定，再进一步，就给你一些特殊的问题。最后，就用“你已参加过国防机密”的借口，而使之失去行动的自由！（以上的话，完全根据我所知道的事实。由于若干当事人还依旧“活”在美国，为了不增加他们的麻烦和困难。我姑隐其姓名，地方及工作的范围。）
    在我这次出席德国科学院二百五十周年纪念会时，我曾听到一个消息说：爱因斯坦曾回答该纪念会的邀请说：“如果我能取得护照，我是会一定来参加的！”但结果他并未参加！
    关于爱因斯坦在美国的遭遇，可以从下列一件事件中看出：大约是在去年年底，他发表了《广义引力论》，当时一些报纸上曾以大字标题，大大的“捧”了一阵。可是在今年二月间，爱因斯坦警告美帝不要随便玩弄氢气弹，因而触怒了资本家们，因为拆穿了他们想独霸世界的迷梦，于是便指使代表资本家的利益的议员们出来说话：“爱因斯坦对原子能并无贡献，他的左倾态度，早就该把他驱逐出境！”
    为什么在极短的时间内，美帝舆论的态度会变得如此之快呢？道理是非常简单的。因为美国的舆论，一般说来，是代表着华尔街老板们的利益的，而从老板们看来，科学家只不过是自己的一种雇员而已！主人对仆人可以利用的时候，就“捧”一下，当仆人的发言影响到主人的利益时，当然就免不了会遭到指斥！
    一般科学家的命运既如此，至于我们中国在美的科学家的遭遇就更坏了。有一位中国在美执教的教授，在两个月以前，移民局忽然找他谈话，并要他在一项文件上签字，那文件的内容有下列四条：①不是共产党。②不是同路人。③没有来往的亲戚朋友是共产党。④在共产党政权之下，我不愿意回中国去。这样苛刻的条件，这位中国科学家当然无法签字。但为了不吃眼前亏起见，他只好委婉地说：“我没法在这文件上签字，因为我母亲在中国，迟早是要回去看母亲的！”结果，美国移民局就叫他在下列三个条件中选择其一：①扣留起来。②驱逐出国。③换一个工作。
    这便是自称为“科学极发达的国家！”这便是所谓美国的“自由”，“民主”！生活在这里的科学家们，不但被否定了做人的自由，抑且否定了工作的自由——做他们所不愿做的工作！这次在柏林，我遇见的一位科学权威说得好：“第一次世界大战之后，美国做了德国科学家的避难所。而现在，第二次世界大战之后，美国的科学家将要寻找着另外的避难所了！”
    从美帝对待科学家的态度来看，我们不难推断：它的科学发展是正在走下坡路了！而相反的，我们——以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的科学家们，在为人民服务的基础上，其发展的前途，则是无限光明的！
