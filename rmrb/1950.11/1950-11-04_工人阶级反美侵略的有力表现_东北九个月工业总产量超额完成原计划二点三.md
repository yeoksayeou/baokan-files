    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Northeast Daily: Amidst the rising tide of opposition to the American imperialists' expansion of their war of aggression, good news is pouring in from the production front. According to the comprehensive statistics office of the Planning Department of the Northeast People's Government's Industry Department: Based on the monthly production and sales reports from various units, the total industrial output from January to September, calculated at constant prices, has reached 102.3% of the planned target, fulfilling 67.9% of the annual plan, equivalent to 314.4% of the output in the same period last year, and 192% of the total output for the entire year last year.
    Among the 34 major products from January to September, eight have already completed and exceeded the annual plan ahead of schedule. Namely: electrical wire (produced by the Electrical Engineering Bureau) completed 129.7% of the annual plan, insulators completed 138.5%, flat glass completed 119.1%, concentrated sulfuric acid completed 147.5%, boilers completed 106.8%, steam hammers (produced by Jianxin Company) completed 100%, cement completed 100%, and ball bearings produced by the Machinery Bureau completed 98.5%, nearing completion of the annual task.
    Twenty-two of the 34 major products have completed and exceeded the planned output from January to September. In addition to those that have completed and exceeded the annual targets, these include electric furnace steel ingots, electrolytic copper, electrolytic lead, coking coal, gasoline, electricity generation and purchase, electric motors, paper, conveyor belts, V-belts, automobile tires, automobile inner tubes, rickshaw tires, rickshaw inner tubes, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth, exceeding the plan by 2.1% to 40%. In addition, pig iron produced in Benxi also exceeded the plan by 9.6%, open-hearth steel ingots produced by the Machinery Bureau exceeded by 3.2%, and raw coal produced in Benxi exceeded by 6.8%.
    Since July of this year, the quality of products in various factories and mines has also significantly improved. For example, the lathes and milling machines produced by the First and Fifth Machinery Factories under the Machinery Industry Administration Bureau have been able to consistently maintain first-class quality. The service life of light bulbs produced by the Electrical Appliance Industry Administration Bureau has doubled compared to the past and has begun to adopt Soviet light efficiency standards. The ash content of coal produced by the Coal Mine Administration Bureau has also decreased from 20.16% in the second quarter to 17.2%.
    Currently, employees of various enterprises in Northeast China are vigorously launching patriotic production competitions against the American imperialists' aggression, working hard to complete and exceed the fourth quarter's plan.

　　工人阶级反美侵略的有力表现
    东北九个月工业总产量超额完成原计划二点三
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：在反对美帝国主义扩大侵略战争声中，生产战线捷报频传。据东北人民政府工业部计划处综合统计室报道：根据各单位的产销月报，以不变价格计算一至九月份的工业总产量，已经完成计划的百分之一百零二点三，完成全年计划百分之六十七点九，相当于去年同期产量百分之三百十四点四，比去年全年为百分之一百九十二。
    一至九月份三十四种主要产品中，已有八种提前完成并超过了全年计划。即：电线（电工局所产）完成全年计划百分之一百二十九点七，碍子完成百分之一百三十八点五，平板玻璃完成百分之一百十九点一，浓硫酸完成百分之一百四十七点五，锅炉完成百分之一百零六点八，汽锤（建新公司所产）完成百分之百，水泥完成百分之百，机械局所产滚珠轴承完成百分之九十八点五已接近完成全年任务。
    完成并超过一至九月份的计划量者三十四种主要产品中有二十二种，除以上完成与超过全年任务者外，其中尚有电炉钢锭、电铜、电铅、炼铁焦炭、汽油、发购电、电动机、纸、运输带、三角带、汽车外胎、汽车内胎、力车外胎、力车内胎、棉纱、棉布等超过计划百分之二点一至四十不等。此外本溪所产生铁亦超过计划百分之九点六，机械局所产平炉钢锭超过百分之三点二，本溪所产原煤超过百分之六点八等。
    自今年七月份以来，各厂矿的产品质量亦有显著提高。如机械工业管理局所属第一、五机械厂所出的车床与铣床已能经常保持为一级品。电器工业管理局生产的灯泡，其使用时间比过去增加一倍，并开始采用了苏联发光效率的标准。煤矿管理局所产煤的灰分亦自第二季度的百分之二十点一六降至百分之十七点二。
    现东北各企业职工正蓬勃展开反对美帝国主义侵略的爱国主义生产竞赛，为完成与超过第四季度计划而加紧努力。
