　　Second World Peace Congress
    *Pravda* Editorial
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th] TASS, Moscow, 16th: Today's *Pravda* published an editorial entitled "The Second World Peace Congress," which reads: Representatives of all peace-loving people have arrived in Warsaw to attend the Second World Peace Congress, and the work of the congress has begun today in Warsaw.

    The Second World Peace Congress is an event of great international significance. It demonstrates the indomitable will of hundreds of millions of people in various countries to fight for peace. The opening of the congress comes at a time when the ruling groups of American and British imperialism are attempting to plunge humanity into the abyss of a new war. From the platform of the Second World Peace Congress, representatives of hundreds of millions of good people will declare their firm determination to defend the cause of peace and thwart the sinister plans of the warmongers.

    The extraordinary significance of the Second World Peace Congress, which opened today, is very clear to hundreds of millions of people in various countries. This is evidenced by many facts, and the powerful wave of protests from people of all countries against the British government's arbitrary police measures aimed at disrupting the work of the congress vividly illustrates their understanding of the significance of the congress.

    Today, this newspaper published an educational document from the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union, which exposes the truth about the British government's conspiracy to undermine the Second World Peace Congress. (People's Daily Editor's Note: This report from the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union can be found on page 4 of this newspaper on November 18th.) The document mentions a circular from British Prime Minister Attlee to representatives of the United Kingdom in several countries in mid-September, which detailed what measures should be taken to obstruct the holding of the congress. Attlee's circular fully reveals the despicable collusion of the Labor Party rulers, who have tried every possible means to obstruct the holding of the congress.

    However, the conspiracies of the war instigators have now been exposed, and their treacherous plans have been completely defeated. The vigilance of the peace fighters and their excellent organizational work have thwarted the warmongers' overall conspiracies and guaranteed the holding of the Second World Peace Congress. The Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress was welcomed and assisted by the government and people of the Republic of Poland and was able to convene the congress in Warsaw within a few days.

    Eighteen months have passed since the First World Peace Congress, during which time the movement to defend peace has become a truly mass movement, uniting the entire progressive humanity under its banner.

    For the first time in world history, an organized front of peace advocates has been established, which is clear evidence of the greatest changes in the political life of the people in recent years.

    Comrade Stalin pointed out on May 1, 1946: "The defeat and elimination of the basic bases of fascism and world aggression have caused profound changes in the political life of people around the world, and have caused a broad growth of democratic movements among people in various countries. The masses of the people have become smarter through the lessons of war, and they have realized that the fate of the country cannot be entrusted to a group of reactionary rulers who pursue narrow class goals and anti-people's selfish goals. It is precisely because of this that the people, who are no longer willing to live as before, take the fate of their countries into their own hands, establish democratic regimes, and actively fight against reactionary forces and new war instigators.

    People all over the world do not want the disasters of war to happen again. They are steadfastly fighting to consolidate peace and security."

    The powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, led by the Soviet Union, is guarding the cause of peace. The People's Democratic countries and the great People's Republic of China are walking in the forefront of peace fighters alongside the Soviet Union. The German Democratic Republic also belongs to the peace camp. The Korean people are waging a heroic struggle for the cause of peace, for their freedom and independence.

    The working class and the masses of working people in the capitalist countries, and the people of the colonies and dependent countries, are also actively fighting for the great cause of peace. Millions of trade unions, women, youth, and student democratic organizations are defending the cause of peace. Hundreds of millions of ordinary people in the world are standing in the ranks of peace advocates. They are vigilantly watching the criminal activities of the imperialist warmongers and their right-wing social democrats and Titoist lackeys. The people of all countries are bravely exposing the bloody plans of the enemies of peace and are fighting in an organized way to strengthen peace and international security. An increasingly broad mass of people is recognizing what a terrible abyss the warmongers are trying to drag them into. Hundreds of millions of ordinary people are seeing more and more clearly the road to consolidating peace.

    Defending peace is a matter for the people of all countries in the world! This call, put forward by the First World Peace Congress, has become the battle program for hundreds of millions of good people in every corner of the earth. All peace-loving people have risen up in response to the call of the First World Peace Congress and are resolutely fighting against the imperialist war instigators.

    In the sacred struggle for peace, there can be no indifferent or neutral people. The world has been divided into two camps. On one side is the camp of peace—the camp of life, truth, and the happiness of the people; on the other side is the camp of war—the camp of death, falsehood, and the suffering of the people. All honest people in the world are resolutely united under the banner of fighting for peace. Millions of workers and peasants, intellectuals, women, and youth—people with various extremely different political views and religious beliefs—have come to the conclusion that only the common efforts of all peace-loving people, only their powerful and organized actions to defend peace, can avoid the new threat of war looming over humanity. In a short period of time, the peace movement has gathered around the platform of fighting for peace an unprecedentedly vast army of people. Now the peace movement is characterized not only by its astonishing scale, but also by its spirit of close unity. This movement has a solid organizational foundation, whether on a national or international scale. For example, the fact that there are national peace committees and various peace committees in seventy-five countries today is enough to illustrate the solidity of its organizational foundation. More than 150,000 local peace committees have been established, and they are now working in almost every country in the world, in towns and villages of all sizes, and in various enterprises and institutions.

    The remarkable achievements of the Stockholm Peace Appeal's signature campaign, which advocated banning atomic weapons and declaring the first government to use such weapons a war criminal, most vividly demonstrated the invincible strength of the peace movement, its enormous scale, and its complete organization. The 500 million signatures collected by the declaration are a terrible force and a stern warning to the war agitators.

    Peace fighters are now expanding the front of the struggle for peace, undertaking the task of winning over more millions of people, especially peasants, the middle strata of urban residents, and women, to participate in this struggle. Peace fighters are now fighting not only for the prohibition of atomic weapons, but also for the implementation of universal disarmament of various armaments, the prohibition of all forms of war propaganda, the condemnation of armed aggression and external interference in the internal affairs of various countries.

    On the eve of the Second World Peace Congress, mass rallies, national peace congresses, and local peace conferences held in various places have all adopted these new demands of peace fighters put forward by the Prague meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Congress Standing Committee. The people who participated in these meetings unanimously passed authorizations for their representatives attending the World Peace Congress, which demanded intensifying the struggle to defend peace, and relentlessly exposing and smashing the bloody conspiracies of American and British conspirators to undermine peace and international security. The representatives of the World Peace Congress, entrusted by the people, will formulate methods to advance the struggle to defend world peace. The Soviet people, nurtured by the spirit of peace and international friendship by the Lenin-Stalin Party, are very concerned about the maintenance and consolidation of peace. The people of all nationalities in our country unanimously approve and support the Stalinist peace policy of the Soviet government. The Soviet government, in today's tense international situation, has repeatedly shown its unwavering struggle to defend peace and to strive for cooperation with all countries.

    The Second All-Soviet Peace Congress, expressing the will of the peace-loving Soviet people, entrusted their representatives to declare at the Second World Peace Congress that all Soviet people are most loyally committed to the cause of peace and are ready to resolutely join hands with peace advocates in all countries to fight to stop the danger of war and ensure lasting peace.

    The well-organized front for defending peace is strong and united. The strength of peace advocates lies in the fact that their struggle against war is supported by the broadest masses of peace-loving people. The cause of the people defending world peace will surely triumph.

    Under the guidance of Comrade Stalin, the genius leader and peace standard-bearer of progressive humanity throughout the world, the powerful peace-loving Soviet people are the vanguard in the struggle to defend peace.

    A warm salute to the Second World Peace Congress and to the active fighters for peace and international friendship!

　　第二届世界保卫和平大会
    真理报社论
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十六日电：今天的真理报以“第二届世界保卫和平大会”为题发表社论写道：一切爱好和平的人民的代表都已到达华沙出席第二届世界保卫和平大会，大会的工作已于今日在华沙开始。
    第二届世界保卫和平大会是有着巨大国际意义的事件。它表现了各个国家亿万人民争取和平的不屈不挠的意志。大会的揭幕正是美英帝国主义统治集团企图把人类投入新战争的深渊的时候。从第二届世界保卫和平大会的讲台上，亿万善良人民的代表们将宣告人民保卫和平事业、挫败战争贩子罪恶计划的坚定决心。
    今天揭幕的第二届世界保卫和平大会特出的意义是各个国家亿万人民所非常明了的。这有许多事实可以证明，各国人民对于企图破坏大会工作的英国政府专横的警察措施所激起了强有力的抗议浪潮，也是生动地说明了他们对大会意义的了解。
    本报今天刊载了电通社一个有教育意义的文件，它揭露了英国政府阴谋破坏第二届世界保卫和平大会的真实情况。（人民日报编者按：电通社这个报道，见本报十一月十八日第四版）这个文件中提到英国首相艾德礼曾于九月中旬给英国驻若干国家的代表的一道通令，其中详细指示他们采取什么措施来阻挠大会的举行。艾德礼这道通令充分泄露了工党统治者们的下流勾当，千方百计地要阻挠大会的举行。
    然而战争挑拨者的阴谋现在已经暴露了，他们毫不讲信义的计划也彻底失败了。和平战士的警惕和他们良好的组织工作挫败了战争贩子的全盘阴谋诡计，保证了第二届世界保卫和平大会的举行。世界保卫和平大会常设委员会得到了波兰共和国政府与人民的招待与帮助，能在几天之内就在华沙召开了大会。
    自从第一届世界保卫和平大会以来已经十八个月了，在这期间，保卫和平的运动已经成了真正的群众性的运动，已把整个进步人类团结在它的旗帜之下。
    世界有史以来第一次，和平拥护者有组织的阵线建立起来了，这是人民在过去几年中政治生活最大变化的明证。
    斯大林同志一九四六年五月一日曾经指出：“法西斯主义与世界侵略的基本根据地的被击溃与被消灭，引起了全世界人民政治生活上深刻的变化，在各国人民中引起了民主运动的广泛增长。人民群众受到战争经验的教训变得更加聪明了，他们已经认识到国家的命运不能交托给一群追求狭隘阶级目的、反人民的自私目的的反动统治者。正因为如此，再也不愿照老样子活下去的人民才把他们国家的命运掌握在自己手里，建立民主政权，积极地与反动力量和新战争挑拨者作斗争。
    全世界人民不愿战争灾难重演。他们正坚定不移地为巩固和平与安全而斗争。”
    以苏联为首的强大的和平、民主与社会主义阵营在警卫着和平事业。人民民主国家及伟大的中华人民共和国与苏联一道走在和平战士的最前列。德意志民主共和国也是属于和平阵营里的。朝鲜人民正在为和平事业，为他们的自由和独立而进行英勇斗争。
    各资本主义国家的工人阶级和劳动人民群众、各殖民地和附属国的人民也都正积极地为伟大的和平事业而斗争。数百万工会、妇女、青年和学生的民主团体都保卫着和平事业。世界各国亿万的普通人民都站在和平拥护者的行列里面。他们警觉地注视着帝国主义战争贩子及其右翼社会党和铁托仆从们的罪恶活动。各国人民都英勇地揭露和平敌人的血腥计划，并且以有组织的方式为加强和平和国际安全而斗争。愈来愈广大的人民群众认清了战争贩子们企图将他们拖入怎样一个可怕的深渊。亿万普通人民愈来愈清楚地看到了导致巩固和平的道路。
    保卫和平乃是关系全世界各国人民的事情！第一届世界保卫和平大会所提出的这个号召已经成了地球上所有角落里亿万善良人民的战斗纲领。一切爱好和平的人民都已经奋起响应第一届世界保卫和平大会的号召，坚决为反对帝国主义战争纵火者而斗争。
    在争取和平的神圣斗争中是不能有漠不关心或者中立的人的。世界已经分为两个阵营。一边是和平阵营——生命、真理与人民幸福的阵营；一边是战争阵营——死亡、虚伪与人民苦难的阵营。世界上任何正直的人们都坚决团结在争取和平的旗帜之下。千百万的工人与农民、知识分子、妇女与青年——具有各种极不相同的政治见解与宗教信仰的人们都得出这样的结论，即：只有一切爱好和平的人民的共同努力，只有他们的强大的有组织的保卫和平行动，才能避免笼罩着人类的新战争威胁。在短短的时期内，和平运动已经在争取和平的讲坛周围团聚了史无前例的如此浩大的人民大军。现在和平运动的特点不仅是它的惊人的规模，而且还有它的紧密的团结一致的精神。这个运动不论在每一个国家或国际范围上说，都有着坚实的组织基础。举例来说，今天七十五个国家有着全国性的保卫和平委员会与各种保卫和平委员会，只要举出这个事实，就足以说明其组织基础的坚固了。十五万个以上的地方性和平委员会已经成立起来，现在它们差不多在世界上每一个国家的大小城镇村庄与各种企业及机关里进行着工作。
    主张禁止原子武器与宣布第一个使用这种武器的政府为战犯的斯德哥尔摩和平宣言的签名征集工作所获得的显著成绩，最生动不过地证明了和平运动的不可战胜的力量、它的巨大的规模与完备的组织。宣言所征集到的五亿个签名对于战争鼓动者是一个可怕的力量与严厉的警告。
    和平战士们现正扩大争取和平的斗争阵线，担负起争取更多的千百万的人民，特别是农民、城市居民的中间阶层与妇女们参加这一斗争的任务。和平战士们现在不仅在为禁止原子武器而斗争，同时也在为实行普遍裁减各种军备、禁止一切形式的战争宣传、谴责武装侵略与外来的对于各国人民内部事务的干涉而斗争。
    在第二届世界保卫和平大会的前夕，各地纷纷举行的群众大会、全国保卫和平大会与地方性的保卫和平会议，都已经通过了世界和大常委会执行局布拉格会议所提出的和平战士的这些新的要求。各地参加这些会议的人们一致通过授予他们出席世界和大的代表的委托书，其中要求加紧进行保卫和平的斗争，不屈不挠地揭露与粉碎美英阴谋家破坏和平与国际安全的血腥阴谋。由人民委任的出席世界和大的代表们将拟定办法，推进保卫世界和平的斗争。在列宁——斯大林党以和平与国际友好的精神培育之下，苏联人民非常关心和平的保持与巩固。我国各族人民一致批准并支持苏联政府的斯大林和平政策。苏联政府在今天国际形势紧张的气氛中，一再地表现它为了保卫和平，为了争取与一切国家的合作，正在进行坚定不移的奋斗。
    第二届全苏拥护和平大会，表达爱好和平的苏联人民的意志，委托他们的代表们在第二届世界保卫和平大会上宣称：全体苏联人民最为忠心地致力于和平事业，而且准备坚决地和所有国家的和平拥护者携起手来，为阻止战争危险及保证持久和平而斗争。
    组织良好的保卫和平阵线是强大的，团结一致的。和平拥护者的力量在于：他们反对战争的斗争受到最广大的爱好和平的人民大众的支持。人民保卫世界和平的事业一定会胜利的。
    在全世界进步人类的天才领袖与和平旗手斯大林同志指导之下，强大的爱好和平的苏联人民是保卫和平斗争的前卫。
    向第二届世界保卫和平大会及为和平与国际友好而斗争的积极战士们致热烈的敬礼！
