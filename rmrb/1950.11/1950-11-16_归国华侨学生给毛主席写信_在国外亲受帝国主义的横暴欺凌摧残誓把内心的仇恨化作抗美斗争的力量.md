Overseas Chinese Students Returning Home Write to Chairman Mao
Having Personally Suffered the Brutality, Bullying, and Destruction of Imperialism Abroad, Vowing to Transform Inner Hatred into Strength for the Struggle Against America
Former Students in the United States at the Political Research Institute of North China Revolutionary University Pledge to Dedicate All Their Strength to Fight the National Enemy
Respected Chairman Mao:

American imperialism, in its vain attempt to conquer and enslave the people of the world, brazenly launched a war of aggression against Korea and further violated our sacred airspace, territorial waters, and land, creating a series of bloody crimes. Under these circumstances, we cannot engage in peaceful construction, nor can we even live a day in peace. Therefore, we resolutely support Premier Zhou's statement and the joint declaration of all democratic parties, and vow to complete the sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country through voluntary action.

We lived in the United States for some time and directly suffered from American imperialist discrimination and persecution. Our tens of thousands of overseas Chinese compatriots were forced to live in a few narrow streets and had to do the least paid and hardest labor to maintain their lives. Laundries and restaurants opened by overseas Chinese were often robbed, and overseas Chinese residences were frequently subjected to various harassments. Even women were raped without recourse. The lives and property of overseas Chinese were not guaranteed at all.

On the one hand, the American ruling class wanted to extract the blood and sweat of overseas Chinese. On the other hand, they were afraid that they would multiply and become a political force. Therefore, they imposed particularly strict restrictions on the entry of Chinese women, resulting in a huge disparity in the ratio of men to women among overseas Chinese. For example, in the so-called "Chinatown" in New York, the ratio of men to women is forty to one. This is a heinous means to exterminate the overseas Chinese. Many wives and daughters of overseas Chinese were illegally detained by the U.S. Immigration Bureau upon entry, becoming targets of extortion and abuse. Some were beaten to death, some committed suicide in grief and indignation after being defiled, and some suffered nervous breakdowns due to excessive fright. Not only that, but the American imperialists also instilled enslaved education into the children of overseas Chinese, attempting to make them lose the concept of their motherland and become their loyal servants.

Recently, the persecution of Chinese students in the United States by the U.S. government has intensified day by day. Student organizations, such as the Association of Chinese Students and Scientists in America, were forced to disband; student publications, such as the "Newsletter of Chinese Students in America," were forced to cease publication; some students were followed and interrogated by American secret agents, and their residences were unreasonably searched. In addition, the U.S. government used threats and inducements to prevent students from returning home to serve the country, using the name of "scholarships" to force students to fill out forms supporting the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. Many professors and students who were preparing to return home were subjected to various difficulties. Those who had already set off to return, such as Qian Xuesen and Zhao Zhongyao, were even detained midway.

The above facts are just a few examples of what we have personally suffered and seen, and are not enough to illustrate the ferocity and brutality of American imperialism.

We thank you, dear Chairman Mao. Thanks to your wise and great leadership, the Chinese people overthrew the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which was strongly supported by American imperialism, and established a free and independent New China, giving us a happy and warm motherland. Because we have directly suffered from the oppression of American imperialism, we feel even more the glory and preciousness of living freely in the embrace of our motherland. But American imperialism does not allow us to build peacefully and become independent and prosperous. It uses every means to sabotage and attack us, and brings the flames of war to our doorstep. We can no longer tolerate it. We only have the path of saving our neighbors and saving ourselves. We have already donated money and clothing and guarantee absolute obedience to the needs of the motherland. Before taking up combat positions, we will redouble our efforts to study and enrich ourselves. Many students have also signed up to join the Volunteer Army to Aid Korea, requesting to go to the front line and dedicate themselves to killing the enemy.

Dear Chairman Mao, we solemnly swear to you: We will dedicate all our strength to fight to the end to crush the aggression of the mortal enemy of the Chinese nation—American imperialism!

Overseas Chinese Youth Returning from Southeast Asia Express Their Determination to Resist America and Aid Korea, Willing to Make Any Sacrifice

Respected Chairman Mao:

We are overseas Chinese youth who have returned from various parts of Southeast Asia, and we have personally suffered the cruel and poisonous destruction of imperialism. For the construction of the motherland, we are following your instructions to study.

Since the American imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea in June and invaded our territory of Taiwan, American planes have repeatedly violated our country's airspace in Northeast China and the coastal areas of Shandong, massacred our people, destroyed our property, and pushed the invading Korean army in large numbers towards the Yalu and Tumen Rivers, directly threatening our border. These frantic actions have made us deeply aware that the purpose of American imperialism's aggression against Korea is mainly to invade China. American imperialism is adopting the old tricks of the Japanese寇 invading our country in those years; at the same time, it has made us fully understand that to defend our motherland, we must support Korea. Today, when the safety of the motherland is seriously threatened, forcing the construction of the motherland and our studies to be hindered, we want to resolutely express to you:

We resolutely support the joint declaration of all democratic parties and take practical actions to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. We are determined to join the Volunteer Army to Aid Korea, resolutely resist American imperialist aggression, and spare no sacrifice to dedicate our lives to the glorious task of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country!

With the most sublime respect,

Du Juntian and 116 other students of the Overseas Chinese School attached to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government

### 归国华侨学生给毛主席写信  在国外亲受帝国主义的横暴欺凌摧残誓把内心的仇恨化作抗美斗争的力量

　　归国华侨学生给毛主席写信
    在国外亲受帝国主义的横暴欺凌摧残誓把内心的仇恨化作抗美斗争的力量
    华北革大政治研究院原留美学生愿献出一切力量与民族敌人搏斗
    敬爱的毛主席：
    美帝国主义妄想征服和奴役全世界的人民，悍然发动侵略朝鲜的战争，并进一步侵犯了我国神圣的领空、领海和领土，制造了一连串的血腥罪行。在这种情势下，我们不但不能和平建设，连一天安静的日子也过不成。因此，我们坚决拥护周总理的声明和各民主党派联合宣言，誓以志愿行动来完成抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务。
    我们曾经在美国居住过一些时候，直接受过美帝的歧视和迫害。我们成千成万的华侨同胞被迫集中居住在几条狭小的街道里，不得不做报酬最少，工作最苦的劳役来维持生活。华侨所开的洗衣馆、餐馆常被打劫，华侨的住宅经常受到各种骚扰，甚至妇女被强奸而控告无门，华侨的生命财产是毫无保障的。
    美国统治阶级一方面要榨取华侨的血汗，一方面又怕他们繁殖起来，成为一种政治上的势力，所以对中国妇女入境限制特别严格，以致华侨男女的比例相差极大。例如，在纽约的所谓“唐人街”，男与女的比例是四十比一，这就是要使华侨灭种的丧尽天良的手段。许多华侨妻女一入境就被美国移民局非法扣押起来，成为勒索和虐待的对象，有的被毒打致死，有的被污后悲愤自杀，有的因过度惊恐而神经失常。不但如此，美帝还向华侨子女灌输奴化教育，企图使他们丧失祖国的观念，成为它忠实的奴仆。
    最近美国政府对中国留学生的迫害也日甚一日。学生团体，如中国留美科学工作者协会被迫解散；学生刊物，如《留美学生通讯》被迫停刊；一些同学受到美国特务的跟踪和盘诘，住所被无理搜查。除此之外，美国政府更用威胁利诱的手段使同学不能回国服务，拿“助学金”的名义来强迫同学填写拥护蒋匪帮的表格，许多准备回国的教授和同学受到各种留难，已经起程返国的如钱学森、赵忠尧等竟被中途扣押。
    以上所举事实不过是我们亲身受到和见到的几个例子而已，不足以说明美帝的凶恶残暴于万一。
    我们感谢你，亲爱的毛主席，由于你的英明伟大的领导，中国人民推翻了美帝所极力支持的蒋匪帮的反动统治，建立了独立自由的新中国，使我们有了一个幸福温暖的祖国。由于我们直接受过美帝的压迫，我们更感到在祖国怀抱里自由生活的光荣和可贵。但是美帝不让我们和平建设，独立富强起来，用尽方法来破坏和进攻我们，把战火燃烧到我们的门口，我们再也不能容忍了。我们只有救邻自救的一条路。我们已经捐献款项和衣物，并保证绝对服从祖国需要。在未走上战斗岗位之前，加倍努力学习，充实自己。许多同学并已报名参加援朝志愿军，要求奔赴前线，献身杀敌。
    亲爱的毛主席，我们向你庄严宣誓：我们要献出我们的一切力量，为粉碎中华民族的死敌——美帝国主义的侵略而斗争到底！
    华北人民革命大学政治研究院留美学生丁则民等一百零三人
    从东南亚归国的华侨青年表示抗美援朝不惜任何牺牲
    敬爱的毛主席：
    我们是从东南亚各地归国的华侨青年，曾亲身饱受了帝国主义酷毒摧残。为了祖国的建设事业，我们正遵循着您的指示进行学习。
    美帝国主义者在六月发动侵略朝鲜的战争，同时侵犯我国领土台湾以后，在这四个月来，美机三番四次侵犯我国东北的领空和山东沿海，屠杀我国人民，炸毁我国的财产，并将侵朝陆军，大量向鸭绿江、图们江逼进，直接威胁我国边境。这些疯狂行动，已使我们深切地认识美帝侵略朝鲜的目的，主要地是为了侵略中国，美帝正袭用着当年日寇侵略我国的故技；同时也使我们完全明白保卫祖国必须支援朝鲜。在今天，祖国安全已受到严重威胁，迫使祖国的建设事业和我们的学习受到阻碍的时候，我们要向您坚决表示：
    我们坚决拥护各民主党派的联合宣言，用实际行动抗美援朝保家卫国，我们决心参加援朝志愿军，坚决反抗美帝侵略，不惜任何牺牲地献出我们的生命，为抗美援朝保家卫国的光荣任务而奋斗！
    谨致
    最崇高的敬礼
