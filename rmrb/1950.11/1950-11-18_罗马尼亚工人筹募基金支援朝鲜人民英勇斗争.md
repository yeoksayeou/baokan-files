　　Romanian Workers Raise Funds to Support the Korean People's Heroic Struggle

　　Bucharest, September 6th (the capital of Romania) - Several thousand workers in Bucharest held a grand rally. At the rally, representatives of the Romanian Trade Union delegation, who had just returned from Korea, reported on their impressions of visiting Korea.

　　In the hall where the masses participating in the conference gathered, the slogan "Get out of Korea!" resounded throughout the venue.

　　Ikatrina Bauli Lan, head of the Romanian Trade Union delegation, recounted the atrocities of the imperialist aggressors, and especially emphasized the Korean people's determination to fight for freedom. The trade union delegation, on behalf of Romanian trade unions, donated 77 million lei to Korean women, children, the elderly, and victims of the barbaric bombing by American aircraft.

　　Subsequently, railway worker Wanduva spoke, suggesting the creation of a fund to support the Korean people's anti-imperialist struggle. This proposal was immediately unanimously approved by all attendees. Delegate Anton Imilan read a letter from the Korean people expressing their gratitude to the Romanian working class for their support.

　　"We reply to our Korean brothers that we, the workers of the Romanian Republic, support their arduous struggle and stand with them. These words express the wishes of every participant."

　　Finally, a telegram was sent to the Trade Union of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to express the Bucharest working people's high respect for the heroic struggle of the Korean working class and their anger at the atrocities of American imperialism, as well as a telegram to the United Nations, demanding an immediate halt to the shameless aggression in Korea.

　　The Romanian working people also held mass rallies throughout the country to listen to reports from the Romanian Trade Union delegation, which had recently returned from Korea, about the American aggression and the heroic struggle of the Korean people.

　　Tens of millions of workers participated in these rallies. In Timisoara, the participating workers exceeded 40,000, in Polusti, more than 20,000, and in Gravia, Stalin City, Liszta, Hongnidula, and Krutje, the masses were all above 10,000. At these meetings, they expressed their unanimous determination to stand with the Korean people's heroic struggle, as well as their common call to stop American intervention in Korea and punish the aggressors.

　　The most resolute defenders of peace – the representatives of the advanced working class – pledged to fully support the Korean people's struggle for freedom and independence and to fulfill and overfulfill the state's plans, giving a blow to those who attempt to provoke a new world war.

　　Ursu Ili, a hardware worker at the Suvolun Metal Factory, declared: "The American bandits who are carrying out massacres in Korea are no different from the Nazis who carried out massacres in our country not long ago. The German fascist chieftain Hitler is no different from the American fascist chieftain Truman." These words clearly reveal the Romanian working class's anger at the atrocities of the American aggressors in Korea.

　　Wherever such rallies were held, workers suggested establishing funds to support the Korean people. These suggestions were warmly welcomed by the participating workers.

　　罗马尼亚工人筹募基金支援朝鲜人民英勇斗争
    九月六日，布加勒斯特（罗马尼亚的首都）的好几千工人举行了一个盛大的集会，在会上，新从朝鲜归来的罗马尼亚工会代表团的代表们报告他们访问朝鲜印象。
    在参加大会的群众聚集的大厅中，“滚出朝鲜去！”的口号响彻了会场。
    罗马尼亚工会代表团团长伊卡特里纳·包里兰叙述了帝国主义侵略者的暴行，并特别强调了朝鲜人民为自由而斗争的决心。工会代表团曾代表罗马尼亚各工会捐助七千七百万罗币，给朝鲜的妇孺老弱以及遭受美机野蛮轰炸的受害者。
    随后，铁路工人万都娃讲演，他建议创设一种基金，支援朝鲜人民反帝国主义的斗争。这一建议立刻获得全体会众的一致通过。代表团团员安东·伊米兰宣读了朝鲜人民对于罗马尼亚工人阶级的支援行动表示感谢的信。
    “我们回答朝鲜弟兄们说，我们罗马尼亚共和国的工人们支援他们的坚苦的斗争中，并和他们站在一起。这些话表达了每一个与会群众的意愿。”
    最后，通过致电朝鲜民主主义人民共和国职业同盟，以表示布加勒斯特劳动人民对于朝鲜工人阶级英勇斗争的崇高敬意以及对美帝国主义暴行的愤怒，并致电联合国，要求立即制止在朝鲜的无耻侵略。
    罗马尼亚劳动人民还在全国各地举行了群众性的集会，听取最近访问朝鲜归国的罗马尼亚工会代表团关于美国的侵略暴行和朝鲜人民英勇斗争的报告。
    这些集会有成千万的工人们参加。在提米索拉，参加的工人群众超过四万，在波鲁斯提，在二万以上，葛拉维亚、斯大林城、里斯塔、宏尼都拉和克鲁捷各地的群众都在一万以上。在这些会上都表示了他们与朝鲜人民英勇斗争的一致决心，以及要求制止美国干涉朝鲜和惩处侵略者的共同呼声。
    最坚决的和平保卫者——先进的工人阶级代表们，保证以全力支援朝鲜人民争取自由独立的斗争，并完成和超额完成国家的计划，予企图挑起新的世界大战的人们以打击。
    苏伏伦金属工厂的五金工人乌尔苏·伊利宣称：“在朝鲜进行屠杀的美国匪帮与不久以前在我国进行屠杀的纳粹并没有什么分别。德国法西斯头子希特勒与美国法西斯头子杜鲁门并没有什么不同。”这些话明白地表露出罗马尼亚工人阶级对于美国侵略者在朝鲜的暴行激起的愤怒。
    在举行这种集会的地方，工人们都建议设立支援朝鲜人民的基金。这些建议获得与会工人们的热烈欢迎。
