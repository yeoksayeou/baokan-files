Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: On November 6th, MacArthur, the commander of the American troops invading Korea, issued a communiqué, falsely accusing the righteous actions of our People's Volunteers in aiding the Korean people and resisting American aggression as "foreign interference," and simultaneously illegally submitted a so-called report to the United Nations Security Council. On November 8th, Austin, the American representative to the United Nations, even issued a shameless statement regarding MacArthur's "report," attempting to once again usurp the name of the United Nations, further expand the war of aggression against Korea, and openly invade our country. The spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, regarding this matter, issued the following statement on November 11th:

　　MacArthur's report and Austin's statement, from beginning to end, distort facts, invert right and wrong, strike a pose, and use it to intimidate people. The real fact is that the United States is invading Chinese territory, infringing upon Chinese sovereignty, and threatening Chinese security; the Chinese people have every reason to accuse the American government of increasingly brutal and tyrannical provocations and aggression against China. The Chinese people, filled with righteous indignation, are voluntarily aiding the Korean people and resisting American aggression, which is a completely reasonable and just act. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China still insists on a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, but the Chinese people will never fear the intimidation of any aggressor.

　　From the beginning of the American war of aggression against Korea, it immediately dispatched its navy to invade China's Taiwan, and then dispatched its air force to intrude into the airspace of Northeast China and carry out bombing. The United Nations has already accepted the Chinese government's complaint about the American navy's invasion of Chinese Taiwan and is preparing to discuss this complaint. The American air force's invasion of Chinese airspace, bombing of Chinese territory, killing of Chinese people, and destruction of Chinese property have been occurring endlessly for three months. According to incomplete statistics, the atrocities of the American military invading Korea in bombing our Northeast are shown in the attached table, and the number of times has recently increased daily. All these atrocities committed by the American military in violating China's territory and sovereignty and threatening China's security have sounded the alarm for all the Chinese people. The Chinese people, filled with righteous indignation, have expressed their willingness to aid the Korean people and resist American aggression. Facts have proved that the United States' purpose in invading Korea is not only for Korea itself but also to expand its aggression against China; the survival of Korea and the safety of China have always been closely linked, and aiding Korea and resisting America is precisely for the purpose of protecting our homes and defending our country. Therefore, the Chinese people's expression of their willingness to aid Korea and resist America is completely reasonable.

　　The Chinese people's reasonable expression of their willingness to aid Korea and resist America has precedents and is beyond reproach. As everyone knows, in the 18th century, the progressive French people, under the advocacy of Lafayette, used such voluntary actions to aid the American people in their war of independence. Before the Second World War, people from all over the world who supported democracy, including the British and American people, also used such voluntary actions to aid the Spanish people who were fighting against Franco in the Spanish Civil War. All of these are universally recognized acts of justice.

　　The Chinese people's voluntary aid to the Korean people in resisting American aggression has an even deeper moral foundation. The Chinese people will never forget the chivalrous actions of the Korean people in aiding the Chinese people's revolutionary war with their voluntary actions. The Korean people not only participated in the Chinese people's War of Liberation but also participated in the Chinese people's Northern Expedition from 1925 to 1927, the Land Revolution War from 1927 to 1937, and the War of Resistance Against Japan from 1937 to 1945. In the four stages of the Chinese people's revolution, the Korean people have always stood with the Chinese people, one after another, fighting to overthrow the reactionary forces of imperialism and feudalism. Now that the Korean people are under the bloody massacre of the American aggressors, the Chinese people feel the same and cannot ignore it, which is only natural.

　　Since the Chinese people's righteous expression of their willingness to aid Korea and resist America is so reasonable, so just, and so upright and beyond reproach, the Chinese government has no reason to prevent them from voluntarily going to Korea to participate in the Korean people's great war of liberation against the American aggressors under the command of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The American imperialists launched a war of aggression against Korea, invaded China's Taiwan, and bombed Chinese territory, thus seriously threatening China's security. Now they dare to accuse the Chinese people's righteous act of voluntarily aiding Korea and resisting America as "foreign interference," forgetting that the interferers and aggressors are themselves, while the Chinese people's voluntary action to aid Korea and resist America is precisely to resist their interference and aggression against China and Korea. The American aggressors have stretched their spear out too far, it has stretched across the five thousand miles of the Pacific Ocean and stuck into the territory of China and Korea. According to the American imperialists, this does not count as aggression, but the just struggle of the Chinese and Korean people to defend their land and people is called aggression. However, the right and wrong in the world cannot be arbitrarily reversed by the aggressors, and the ugly faces of the aggressors can never be covered up. The Chinese and Korean people firmly demand that the American aggressors and their accomplices put away their spears of aggression and withdraw their invading troops. If the aggression does not stop, the struggle against aggression will never stop.

　　It was the American government that provoked the Korean civil war, it was the American government that launched the war of aggression against Korea, it was the American government that invaded China's Taiwan and bombed Chinese territory, threatening China's security. From the very beginning, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China opposed the American government's war of aggression against Korea and advocated a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue; now, it still firmly opposes the American government's war of aggression against Korea and advocates a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. In order to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, foreign troops must first be withdrawn from Korea, and the Korean issue must be resolved by the North and South Korean people themselves. This is the only way to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. The Chinese people love peace, but the Chinese people are not afraid of resisting wars of aggression, and they will never bow their heads in the face of any aggressor's intimidation.

　　严斥麦克阿瑟及奥斯汀无耻谰言
　　我外交部发言人发表声明     
    我国人民志愿援朝抗美是完全合理和正义的行为中朝人民坚决要求美帝及其帮凶收起侵略的长矛我坚决主张外国军队撤出朝鲜和平解决朝鲜问题
    【新华社十一日讯】十一月六日，美国侵略朝鲜军队总司令麦克阿瑟发表公报，诬指我国人民志愿援助朝鲜人民、反抗美国侵略者的正义行动为“外国干涉”，并同时非法地向联合国安全理事会提出所谓报告。十一月八日，美国驻联合国代表奥斯汀更就麦克阿瑟的“报告”，发表无耻声明，企图再一次盗用联合国名义，进一步扩大侵略朝鲜战争，公开侵略我国。我外交部发言人特就此事，于十一月十一日发表下列声明：
    麦克阿瑟的报告和奥斯汀的声明，从头到尾是歪曲事实，颠倒是非，装腔作势，借以吓人。真正的事实是美国侵略中国领土，侵犯中国主权，威胁中国安全；中国人民有一切理由控诉美国政府对中国日益凶残横暴的挑衅与侵略。中国人民激于义愤，志愿援助朝鲜人民，反抗美国侵略，是完全合理的和正义的行为。中华人民共和国中央人民政府仍然坚持和平解决朝鲜问题，但中国人民绝不畏惧任何侵略者的恐吓。
    美国侵略朝鲜的战争一开始，即出动海军侵略中国的台湾，接着又出动空军侵入中国东北的领空，并施行轰炸。美国海军侵略中国台湾一事，联合国已接受中国政府的控诉案，并准备讨论这个控诉案。美国空军侵略中国领空、轰炸中国领土、杀害中国人民、毁坏中国财产一事，则三个月以来层出不穷。根据不完全的统计，侵朝美军空袭我国东北的暴行有如附表，其次数到最近已逐日增加。美国军队所有这一切侵犯中国领土、主权与威胁中国安全的暴行，向全中国人民敲起了警钟。中国人民乃激于义愤，纷纷表示志愿援助朝鲜人民，反抗美国侵略。事实证明了，美国侵略朝鲜的目的，不仅是为了朝鲜本身，而且是为了扩大侵略中国；朝鲜的存亡与中国的安危从来就是密切关联着的，援朝抗美正是为了保家卫国。因此，中国人民这种志愿援朝抗美的表示是完全合理的。
    中国人民志愿援朝抗美的合理表示，世有先例，无可指摘。大家知道，十八世纪，前进的法国人民就曾在拉斐德的倡导之下，用这样的志愿行动，援助过独立战争中的美国人民。第二次大战之前，世界各国拥护民主的人民，包含英国人民和美国人民，也同样用这样的志愿行动，援助过西班牙内战中反佛朗哥的西班牙人民。这一切都是举世公认的正义行为。
    中国人民志愿援助朝鲜人民反抗美国侵略，更有其深厚的道义基础。中国人民永远不能忘记朝鲜人民用志愿的行动援助中国人民革命战争的侠义行为。朝鲜人民不仅参加了中国人民的解放战争，而且还参加了一九二五至二七年中国人民的北伐战争，一九二七至一九三七年的土地革命战争，一九三七至一九四五年的抗日战争。在中国人民革命的四个阶段中，朝鲜人民始终站在中国人民一起，前仆后继，为打倒帝国主义和封建主义的反动势力而斗争。现在朝鲜人民处于美国侵略者的血腥屠杀之下，中国人民感同身受，不能置之不理，乃是理所当然的。
    中国人民志愿援朝抗美的正义表示，既然是如此合理，如此合乎正义，如此光明正大而无可指摘，中国人民政府就没有任何理由阻止他们志愿前往朝鲜，在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的指挥之下，参加朝鲜人民反抗美国侵略者的伟大解放战争。美帝国主义者发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，侵略了中国的台湾，轰炸了中国东北的领土，因而严重地威胁了中国的安全，现在竟胆敢指摘中国人民志愿援朝抗美的义举为“外国的干涉”，忘记了干涉者和侵略者正是他们自己，而中国人民援朝抗美的志愿的行动正是为了反抗他们对于中朝两国的干涉和侵略。美国侵略者的矛头伸出得太长了，它竟伸过了五千英里的太平洋，插进到中国与朝鲜的领土上，根据美国帝国主义分子的说法，这却不算是侵略，而中朝两国人民保卫自己土地人民的正义斗争，却叫做侵略。然而世界上的公是公非究竟不容侵略者随意加以颠倒，侵略者的丑恶嘴脸是永远掩盖不了的。中朝两国人民坚决要求美国侵略者及其帮凶们收起它那侵略的长矛，撤退其侵略军。侵略不停止，反抗侵略的斗争是绝不会停止的。
    是美国政府挑起了朝鲜的内战，是美国政府发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，是美国政府侵略中国的台湾，轰炸中国的领土，威胁中国的安全。中华人民共和国中央人民政府一开始就反对美国政府侵略朝鲜的战争，主张和平解决朝鲜问题；现在，仍然坚决反对美国政府侵略朝鲜的战争，主张和平解决朝鲜问题。为了和平解决朝鲜问题，首先必须使外国军队一律撤出朝鲜，朝鲜问题由南北朝鲜人民自己解决。这是和平解决朝鲜问题的唯一道路。中国人民热爱和平，但中国人民并不害怕反抗侵略战争，更不会在任何侵略者的恐吓面前低下自己的头来。（附图表）
