Denouncing the American Conspiracy Against Tibet

American imperialism is now plotting to use the United Nations to interfere with the Chinese people's liberation of their own territory, Tibet. The recent proposal by the representative of the El Salvador government at the UN General Assembly to interfere in the Tibetan issue is a concrete manifestation of this American conspiracy.

El Salvador is a small country on the west coast of Central America, and its government has always been under American control. Its raising of the Tibetan issue at the UN General Assembly this time was clearly done at the behest of the United States. El Salvador's proposal is actually the American proposal. On November 1, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson openly slandered the Chinese people's action of liberating their own territory of Tibet as "aggression" at a press conference in Washington, and nonsensically claimed that "the United States considers this a most unfortunate and serious event." On November 13, U.S. Ambassador to India Henderson also stated in New Delhi that the United States was "interested" in the situation in Tibet. On November 15, the semi-official American newspaper *The New York Times* even more explicitly urged the United Nations to "intervene" in the Tibetan issue. On the same day, El Salvador submitted a proposal on the Tibetan issue to the UN General Assembly, requesting the UN General Assembly to establish a committee to study "appropriate measures" that the General Assembly could take on the matter. This proposal was submitted to the United Nations by El Salvador's Ambassador to the United States, Castro, from Washington, which clearly indicates the background of the proposal. According to a November 15 dispatch from Chenggong Lake by the Kuomintang's Central News Agency, the Chenggong Lake side also believed that El Salvador's proposal "was instigated by the United States."

Tibet has always been Chinese territory, a fact recognized worldwide. The United States' instigation of El Salvador to submit a proposal to interfere in Tibet is a blatant act of infringing upon Chinese sovereignty and a complete violation of the UN Charter. Article 2 of the UN Charter stipulates that "All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any member state or state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations," ​​and stipulates the United Nations "shall not intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state." The United Nations, under American manipulation, has unreasonably interfered in Korea, thereby undermining the UN Charter and committing heinous crimes against world peace. If the UN General Assembly dares to accept the unreasonable demand for interference in China's internal affairs under American instigation this time, it will once again prove that the so-called representatives of the "majority of countries" in the United Nations have become shameful tools for American imperialist aggressors to antagonize the People's Republic of China.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army's entry into Tibet is to expel foreign imperialist forces, liberate the Tibetan people, complete the unification of the motherland, and defend the sacred border. This is required by the interests of all our people and will inevitably be victoriously realized. The aim of the American imperialists in trying their best to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Tibet is to preserve imperialist forces in Tibet, so as to turn Tibet into a military base for further aggression against China. All the aggressive steps taken by the American imperialists in the Far East today, including its armed aggression against Korea and its intervention in Vietnam, are actually preparations to encircle China militarily in order to prepare for a large-scale aggression against China. After forcibly occupying China's territory of Taiwan, American imperialism is now妄图 attempting to use all kinds of conspiracies to prevent the Chinese people from liberating their own territory of Tibet. But all these shameless and criminal acts will have no other result than to further strengthen the Chinese people's determination to crush imperialist aggression.

### 斥美国对西藏的阴谋

　　斥美国对西藏的阴谋
    美帝国主义现在正阴谋利用联合国来干涉中国人民解放自己的领土西藏。最近萨尔瓦多政府代表在联合国大会上所提出的干涉西藏问题的提案，就是美国这一阴谋的具体表现。
    萨尔瓦多是中美西海岸的一个小国，它的政府一向是在美国控制下的。它这次在联合国大会上提出西藏问题，显然是受了美国的指示。萨尔瓦多的提案实际上就是美国的提案。十一月一日，美国国务卿艾奇逊曾在华盛顿记者招待会上公开诬蔑中国人民解放自己的国土西藏的行动是“侵略”，并胡说什么“美国认为这是一件最不幸最严重的事件”。十一月十三日美国驻印度大使韩德逊又在新德里声明美国对西藏局势感到“兴趣”。十一月十五日美国的半官方报纸《纽约时报》社论更明白地敦促联合国“干预”西藏问题。同日，萨尔瓦多即向联合国大会提出西藏问题的提案，要求联合国大会设立委员会研究联大可以对此采取的“适当措施”。这一提案是经由萨尔瓦多驻美大使卡斯特罗从华盛顿向联合国提出的，这就清楚指明了该提案的背景。据国民党中央社成功湖十五日消息，成功湖方面也都认为萨尔瓦多的提案“是出于美国的主使”。
    西藏一向是中国的领土，这是举世公认的事实。美国指使萨尔瓦多提出干涉西藏的提案，是露骨地侵犯中国主权的行为，是完全违反联合国宪章的。联合国宪章第二条规定“各会员国在其国际关系上不得使用威胁或武力，或以与联合国宗旨不符之任何其他方法，侵害任何会员国或国家之领土完整或政治独立”，并规定联合国“不得干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件”。联合国已在美国操纵下无理干涉了朝鲜，因而破坏了联合国宪章，对世界和平犯下了滔天罪行。如果联合国大会这一次竟敢再接受美国唆使下的干涉中国内政的无理要求，那就是再一次证明联合国的所谓“多数国家”的代表已经成为美国帝国主义侵略者敌视中华人民共和国的可耻的工具了。
    中国人民解放军进入西藏，是为了驱逐外国帝国主义势力，解放西藏人民，完成祖国的统一，保卫神圣的边疆，这是我国全体人民的利益所要求的，也是必然会胜利实现的。美帝国主义者竭力阻止中国人民解放西藏，其目的就是为了保留在西藏的帝国主义势力，以便于把西藏变作进一步侵略中国的军事基地。美帝国主义者今天在远东的一切侵略步骤，包括它对朝鲜的武装侵略和对越南的干涉，实际上都是为了在军事上包围中国，以作大规模侵略中国的准备。美帝国主义在武力侵占了中国的领土台湾以后，现在又妄图用种种阴谋来阻止中国人民解放自己的领土西藏。但是一切这些无耻的罪恶行为，除了更加坚定中国人民粉碎帝国主义侵略的决心以外，决不会有别的任何结果。
