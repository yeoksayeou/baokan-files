　　Shanghai Religious Circles Support Declarations of All Parties
　  Spare No Sacrifice to Fight for Peace
          　 Crimes of Imperialism Using Religion for Counter-Revolutionary Activities Will Be Exposed in a Timely Manner
    【Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 10th】 More than 40 representatives of Shanghai's religious circles held a meeting on the 9th and issued a written statement expressing their firm support for the just demands of the people of the whole country to resist America and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country, as well as the joint declaration of the democratic parties.
    The statement said: After more than a hundred years of arduous struggle, the Chinese people have overthrown the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Under the leadership of the Central People's Government, for more than a year, we have been healing the wounds of war and carrying out peaceful construction, and have already achieved brilliant achievements. We value the fruits of our struggle and our achievements, and therefore we need peace even more and love peace even more. At a time when peace is threatened, we declare: Every peace-loving religious person will spare no sacrifice to defend peace.
    The statement said: Imperialists have always used religion, distorted religious doctrines, and manipulated kind believers to carry out their reactionary conspiracies. The American rulers have even more intensified their efforts to organize and direct reactionary elements in some of their religions to carry out insidious espionage activities against our country. We angrily declare: This is what every religious person who upholds the sacredness and purity of religion resolutely opposes to the end. We must be doubly vigilant and expose and eliminate any conspiratorial activities that have infiltrated into religion in a timely manner.
    The statement finally called on religious people throughout the city to unite more closely, to contribute everything we have to strike at the American aggressors, to defend the motherland, to defend peace, and to defend the purity of religion.
    Those who signed the statement included Wu Yaozong, Tu Yuqing, Xie Xiangsan, Yang Huisheng, Chen Hexiang, Chen Shanxiang, Shen Derong, and Shi Baozhen of Christianity; Zong Ditang, Zhang Yaoting, Jin Yaozu, Ma Jinping, Liu Zhaofang, Ma Renbin, and Jin Youyun of Islam; Zhao Puchu, Fang Zifan, Weifang, Dayuan, Shaozong, and Lin Ziqing of Buddhism; and more than forty others.
