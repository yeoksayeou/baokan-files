    Korean War Situation
    The serious Korean War situation is beginning to change. The American invading army, which unscrupulously advanced towards the Sino-Korean border, has been severely hit by the Korean People's Army. On the northwestern front in Korea, the Korean People's Army, with the participation of the Chinese People's Volunteers, launched a powerful counter-offensive and achieved important victories. In the eleven days of operations from October 25 to November 4, the Korean People's Army defeated the elite troops of the Li Chengwan bandit army, including the 1st, 6th, 7th, and 8th Divisions, as well as a part of the American army, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 6,680 enemies, liberating large tracts of land occupied by the American and Li bandits, and pushing the front line south of the Qingchuan River. On the northeastern front, the Korean People's Army is also resolutely resisting the invading enemy and preventing their advance. Behind enemy lines, the guerrilla warfare of the Korean people against the American and Li bandit gangs is unfolding widely and fiercely. According to Kim Tae-sun, the puppet police chief of Li Chengwan, there are currently 48,000 to 50,000 guerrillas in South Korea, with 20 battles occurring every day. Even senior officials at MacArthur's headquarters had to admit that the US military was "threatened by large-scale guerrilla warfare" (Associated Press).
    However, the mad American aggressors still vainly attempt to conquer Korea and invade China. Walker, commander of the US First Army Corps on the western front, and Almond, commander of the Tenth Army Corps on the eastern front, have both been ordered to continue their advance towards the Sino-Korean border. American aggressors are trying to create "public opinion" for attacking China. Under this serious situation, resisting America and aiding Korea, and defending our homes and country, is the sacred duty of the Chinese people.
    The Chinese people love peace. But the Chinese people have never been afraid to take practical action against imperialist aggression to achieve real peace. Now, the surging nationwide volunteer action to resist America and aid Korea, and defend our homes and country, is precisely to defeat the American plot to invade Korea and expand the war, so that the issues of independence and liberation of Korea and other regions can be justly resolved according to the will of the people. Only under these circumstances can peace in Korea and the Far East be restored, can China avoid being invaded, and can our people carry out peaceful construction.
            The United States Intensifies Arming Germany and Japan
    In order to expand the war in Korea and prepare for a new world war, US imperialism is stepping up the arming of West Germany and Japan, attempting to turn them into bases for two major wars in the East and West, and into the main accomplices of the United States in expanding its aggressive adventures. Currently, in addition to illegally using Japanese manpower and materials to participate in the war of aggression against Korea, US imperialism is accelerating the reconstruction of the Japanese fascist armed forces to supplement the significant losses of the United States on the Korean battlefield and to expand its war of aggression in the Far East. Following MacArthur's public order on July 8 to the Yoshida government to establish a militarized "police reserve force," the US Eighth Army Command convened a meeting of generals and above who had fought against the Soviet Union and China in Tokyo in mid-August; at the end of August, MacArthur approved a conspiracy plan to establish a future Japanese army, which was secretly drafted by MacArthur's Chief of Staff and commander of the US Tenth Army Corps, which is attacking the Korean people, Almond, and former Japanese army generals Kawabe, Matsumura, and others; a month later, MacArthur's political advisor, Sebald, and the loyal running dog of the US, Shigeru Yoshida, further discussed the prompt establishment of a so-called Japanese "anti-communist volunteer army" equipped by the United States, totaling twelve Japanese divisions, including four tank divisions. Recently, the Yoshida government has been stepping up conscription. These war preparations by the American occupiers and the Japanese reactionaries have flagrantly violated the provisions of the Potsdam Proclamation on the demilitarization of Japan.
    While expanding the war in Asia and actively preparing for war, the United States is intensifying the arming of West Germany in Europe. The steps taken by the United States to remilitarize Germany are mainly reflected in the following three aspects:
    First, increasing the so-called occupation forces of the United States, Britain, and France in West Germany, which are in fact interventionist forces. Since Truman announced on September 9 that he would increase the number of US troops stationed in Germany, Adenauer, the prime minister of the West German puppet government, announced last month that the occupation forces stationed in West Germany would soon be increased to fifteen divisions. At the same time, John McCloy, the US High Commissioner to Germany, has announced that "the troops that the United States, Britain, and France are sending to West Germany will be stationed in various places according to strategic needs, regardless of the boundaries of each district." This indicates that the armies of Britain and France will be under the unified command of the United States in the future.
    Second, rebuilding the German army. Under the support of the United States, West Germany has now recruited Nazis under various guises to form 450,000 mixed local forces such as "labor battalions" and "police forces." Currently, Adenauer is following the decisions of his masters, the US, British, and French foreign ministers, and is beginning to establish a so-called "mobile police force," which will reach 30,000 by 1952. Recently, the United States has further concluded an agreement with Adenauer, preparing to hand over 200,000 manpower, enough to form ten divisions, to the control of the Americans. To solve the problem of soldiers, Adenauer has also planned to implement universal conscription in West Germany.
    Third, restoring West Germany's war industry, with West German steel production reaching an annual rate of 18 million tons in July this year, far exceeding the original limit of 11 million tons per year. Military industries are universally producing munitions throughout West Germany. For example, the Krupp armaments factory has resumed manufacturing "Panther" tanks, the "Messerschmitt" factory has been manufacturing aircraft parts, and the chemical factory in Mannheim has been manufacturing munitions and poison gas.
    However, the war mongering schemes of the United States in West Germany and Japan have been met with organized resistance from the broad masses of the people in Germany and Japan. People in West Germany have continuously held demonstrations and protest rallies, in which West German workers have become increasingly united. The struggle against West German militarization and for peace and unification is unfolding throughout Germany. At the same time, the broad masses of the Japanese people, regardless of the brutal suppression by the US-Japanese reactionaries, are also engaged in unremitting struggles for peace, democracy, and independence. This clearly shows the determination of the people of Germany and Japan not to let imperialism use their countries as military bases and themselves as cannon fodder.
            United Nations General Assembly at Fifty Days
    The Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly has been going on for more than fifty days since its opening on September 19. The progress of the meeting fully demonstrates that US imperialism is forcibly transforming the United Nations into a tool for expanding its war of aggression, while the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, representing the will of the people of the world, are actively fighting to defend peace, stop aggression, and maintain the United Nations.
    At the United Nations General Assembly, the United States manipulated the majority voting machine to reject the Soviet proposal to expel the illegal representatives of the Kuomintang and invite representatives of our country to attend in order to enable the United Nations to play its legitimate role; it rejected the proposal of the Soviet Union and other five countries to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and passed the eight-country proposal to cover up its expansion of the war of aggression against Korea; it passed the so-called "United Action for Peace," proposed by the United States and other seven countries, which violated the United Nations Charter and usurped the powers of the Security Council, and rejected all the amendments proposed by the Soviet Union, allowing the United States to drive its vassal states at any time to sell their lives for its aggressive war of world hegemony under the guise of manipulating a majority vote in the United Nations General Assembly. In the Political Committee, the United States also manipulated the majority, rejected the "Declaration on Stopping the Threat of New War, Consolidating World Peace and Security" proposed by the Soviet Union to eliminate the current international tension, and, after rejecting various amendments by the Soviet Union, passed the deceptive joint proposal put forward by the United States and other eight countries to cover up its criminal face of opposing the Soviet proposal.
    All these actions of US imperialism clearly show its determination to use the United Nations to advance its plan to expand the war. However, these actions of the United States are completely illegal and opposed by the vast majority of people in the world. The majority voting machine formed in the United Nations under the manipulation of the United States can only represent a small handful of reactionary ruling groups in various countries. The US imperialist plot to use the United Nations to cover up its expansion of aggression and preparation for launching a new world war precisely reflects its fear of the growing democratic forces of the world's people.
    The struggle of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries in the United Nations General Assembly has powerfully exposed this criminal plot of US imperialism. The Soviet Union put forward many reasonable proposals in the meeting, striving to defend peace and strengthen the United Nations, and repeatedly put forward necessary amendments on the basis of the US-British bloc proposals, not letting go of every opportunity to safeguard peace. But all these efforts were rejected by the United States with arrogance. The people of the world therefore see very clearly: who is launching a war of aggression at all costs, and who is doing their utmost to maintain peace. The significant result of the Soviet Union's struggle within the United Nations is to expose US imperialism before the people of the world, thereby educating and uniting the broader masses of the world's people to participate in the struggle to stop American aggression and defend world peace.

    朝鲜战局
    严重的朝鲜战局正在开始发生变化。肆无忌惮地向中朝边境进犯的美国侵略军，已遭到朝鲜人民军的沉重打击。在朝鲜西北部战线，朝鲜人民军在中国人民志愿部队的参加下，举行了强有力的反攻，取得了重要的胜利。在十月二十五日至十一月四日的十一天作战中，朝鲜人民军击溃了李承晚匪军的精锐部队第一、六、七、八等四个师及美军一部，毙、伤、俘敌六千六百八十余名，解放了美、李匪军侵占的大片土地，并将战线推到了清川江以南。在东北部战线，朝鲜人民军亦正坚决地抵抗进犯的敌人，阻止敌人的前进。在敌人后方，朝鲜人民反对美、李匪帮的游击战争，正在广泛和猛烈地展开。据李承晚伪警察长官金泰善承认，南朝鲜现有游击队四万八千人至五万人，每日发生战争二十起。这就连麦克阿瑟总部的高级官员，也不得不承认美军正“受到大规模游击战争的威胁”（美联社）。
    但是，疯狂的美国侵略者仍然妄想征服朝鲜和侵略中国。西线的美第一兵团司令瓦克和东线的第十兵团司令阿尔梦德，都已奉命向中、朝边境继续进犯。美国侵略者正在力图制造进攻中国的“舆论”。在这种严重的情势下，抗美援朝、保家卫国，是中国人民神圣的职责。
    中国人民是热爱和平的。但中国人民从来也不怕以反对帝国主义侵略的实际行动，来取得真实的和平。现在，全国人民风起云涌的抗美援朝、保家卫国的志愿行动，正是为了击败美国侵略朝鲜和扩大战争的阴谋，使朝鲜及其他地区的独立与解放的问题，得以按人民的意志，予以公正的解决。只有在这种情况下，朝鲜与远东的和平才得以恢复，中国才能避免遭受侵略，我国人民才能进行和平建设。
            美国加紧武装德、日
    美帝国主义为了扩大朝鲜的战争，为了准备新的世界大战，正加紧武装西德和日本，企图把它们变成东西两大战争的基地，变成美国扩大侵略冒险的主要帮凶。目前，美帝国主义除了非法地使用日本人力、物力参加侵朝战争以外，并正加紧重建日本法西斯武装部队，以补充美国在朝鲜战场上的重大损失和扩大它在远东的侵略战争。继麦克阿瑟在七月八日公开命令吉田政府建立军队化的“警察后备队”后，美国第八军司令部曾于八月中旬在东京召集曾对苏联和中国作战的将级以上的军官，举行会议；八月底，麦克阿瑟批准了建立日本未来陆军的阴谋计划，这一计划是由麦克阿瑟的参谋长兼正在进攻朝鲜人民的美国第十兵团司令阿尔梦德及前日本陆军将领川侯、松村等人密谋拟订的；在此以后一个月，麦克阿瑟的政治顾问赛鲍尔与美帝忠实走狗吉田茂，进一步讨论了尽快地成立由美国装备的所谓日本“反共志愿军”，总共为十二个日本师，其中包括四个坦克师。最近，吉田政府已在加紧征兵。美国占领者和日本反动派的这些备战计划，粗暴地违反了波茨坦公告关于日本非军事化的规定的。
    与在亚洲扩大战争和积极备战的同时，美国正在欧洲加紧武装西德。美国将德国重新军事化的步骤，主要表现在下列三方面：
    第一是增加美英法在西德实际上是干涉军的所谓占领军。自杜鲁门在九月九日宣布将增加驻德美军以来，西德傀儡政府总理阿登纳上月宣布驻西德的占领军最近即将增至十五个师。同时，美国驻德高级专员麦克洛埃已宣布“美、英、法增派往西德的部队，将按战略上的需要分驻各处，而不考虑各区的界限”。这表示英法两国军队今后将受美国统一指挥。
    第二是重建德国军队。在美国的扶植之下，现在西德已在各种名目下搜罗纳粹分子组成了四十五万“劳动大队”、“警察部队”等杂色地方部队。目前，阿登纳正听从其主子美英法外长会议决定，着手建立所谓“机动警察部队”，这支部队至一九五二年将达三万人。最近以来，美国又已进一步与阿登纳成立协定，准备将足够编成十个师的二十万人力交给美国人支配。为了解决兵员，阿登纳并已策划在西德实行普遍征兵。
    第三是恢复西德的战争工业，今年七月西德钢产量便已达到年率一千八百万吨，远超过原定年产一千一百万吨的限额。西德各地的军事工业已在普遍进行军火生产。诸如：克虏伯兵工厂已在恢复制造“豹”式坦克，“米塞舒米特”工厂已在制造飞机零件，曼海姆的化学工厂已在制造军火与毒气。
    但是，美国战争贩子在西德和日本的备战阴谋，已遭到德日两国广大人民的有组织的反抗。西德各地人民都不断举行了示威游行和抗议大会，在这种反抗中西德工人已日益团结起来。反对西德军事化和争取和平与统一的斗争，正在全德展开。同时，日本广大人民不顾美日反动派的残暴镇压，也正在为争取和平、民主与独立而进行不懈的斗争。这明白地表现了德、日两国人民绝不让帝国主义把他们的国家作为军事基地、把他们作为炮灰的决心。
            联合国大会五十天
    联合国第五届大会自九月十九日开幕以来，已进行了五十多天。会议的进程充分表明了美帝国主义正在强行变联合国为其扩大侵略战争的工具，而代表全世界人民意志的苏联及人民民主国家，正在积极为保卫和平、制止侵略及维护联合国而斗争。
    在联合国大会上，美国操纵多数表决机器，否决了苏联所提驱逐国民党非法代表并邀请我国代表出席以使联合国能起其合法作用的提案；否决了苏联等五国所提和平解决朝鲜问题的提案，而通过了掩饰其扩大侵略朝鲜战争的八国提案；通过了美国等七国所提出的违反联合国宪章、篡夺安理会职权的所谓“保障和平的联合行动”案，而否决了苏联所提的所有修正案，使美国可以随时在操纵联合国大会多数通过决议的掩饰下，驱使各仆从国为其独霸世界的侵略战争卖命。在政治委员会中，美国也同样操纵多数，否决了苏联为消除目前国际紧张局势所提出的“制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全宣言”案，并在否决苏联的各项修正案后，通过了美国等八国为掩饰其反对苏联提案的罪恶面目而提出的欺骗性的联合提案。
    美帝国主义所有这些行动，都清楚说明了它决心借联合国来推进其扩大战争的计划。但是，美国的这些行动是完全非法的，它受到全世界绝大多数人民的反对。而美国操纵下在联合国中形成的多数表决机器，却仅能代表各国一小撮反动统治集团。美帝国主义利用联合国来掩饰其扩大侵略并准备发动新世界大战的阴谋，反恰恰反映其对日益增长的世界人民民主力量的恐惧。
    苏联及人民民主国家在联合国大会上的斗争，有力地揭露了美帝国主义的这种罪恶阴谋。苏联在会议中提出了许多合理的提案，为保卫和平与加强联合国而努力，并且一再在美英集团提案的基础上提出必要的修正案，不放松每一个维护和平的机会。但是这一切努力都为美国所悍然拒绝。全世界人民因此看得很清楚：谁在不顾一切地发动侵略战争，谁在仁至义尽地维护和平。苏联在联合国内斗争的重大成果，就是在全世界人民面前揭露了美帝国主义，从而教育并团结了全世界更广大的人民，参加制止美国侵略与保卫世界和平的斗争。
