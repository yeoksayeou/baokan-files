Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 10th: The Politburo of the French Communist Party recently held a meeting in Paris, chaired by Duclos. The meeting adopted a resolution expressing support for the Soviet government's proposal to the French government to hold a four-power conference of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France to negotiate the German question. The Politburo believes that this proposal is beneficial to France and the cause of peace. The Politburo further pointed out that the Western countries' policy of rearming West Germany poses a serious threat to French security, and called on all party members to launch a powerful mass movement to demand that France immediately negotiate with the Soviet Union.
　　The Politburo exposed the French government's militarization policy, dictated by the United States, and opposed France's increase in military spending, extension of military service, and increase in taxes.

　　Xinhua News Agency, London, November 8th: According to a report from the Telecommunications Agency, the General Secretary of the British Communist Party, Pollitt, issued a statement on the 5th, supporting the Soviet proposal to convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to discuss the elimination of German militarism. Pollitt declared that the proposal is "a truly great opportunity to end the pointless arms race between the United States and Britain," and called on the British people to demand that the Labor government "immediately accept these new proposals that can guarantee peace," regardless of what other countries do.

　　The Workers' Daily published an editorial on the 6th entitled "Seize the Opportunity," supporting the Soviet proposal, saying: "The Soviet Union has once again pointed out the road to peace." The editorial wrote: "The United States government is enthusiastically engaged in the heinous act of betraying the people of Europe and world peace. In order to achieve its insane goal of conquering the world, it is determined to rebuild the German army. Stopping the rebuilding of the German army will be conducive to peace and a major blow to the American conspiracy."
