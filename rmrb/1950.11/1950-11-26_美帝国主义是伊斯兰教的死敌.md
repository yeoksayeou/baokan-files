American Imperialism is the Mortal Enemy of Islam
    Ma Jian
    Since the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea and openly occupied our territory of Taiwan, American planes and warships have constantly provoked our country. The American invading forces in Korea have approached our northeastern border. The United States has released Chinese war criminals and is actively supporting Japan, arming Japan, and at the same time, transporting large quantities of munitions and materials to Taiwan to aid the public enemy Chiang Kai-shek. American imperialism is the mortal enemy of the People's Republic of China. This is an ironclad fact that all compatriots across the country probably know. As for the conspiracy of American imperialism against Islam, I am afraid that our Muslim compatriots do not yet fully recognize it, so it must be exposed.

    A large part of the people in Asia and Africa are Muslims. Islam teaches people to resist aggression and defend peace. The Quran says: "Fight in the way of Allah (truth, justice, humanity) against those who attack you." (2:190) "Permission [to fight] has been given to those who are being fought, because they were wronged." (22:39) If American imperialists want to enslave these vast numbers of Muslims, they must start with cultural aggression. They vainly imagine that these warriors who resist aggression and defend peace will not oppose evil people as long as they believe in Christianity; that if a rude and unreasonable person slaps them on the right cheek, they will obediently offer their left cheek. When that time comes, American imperialism can exploit and oppress them as it pleases.

    In April 1930, Dr. S.M. Zwemer, an American "expert" on Islam, published an editorial in the journal *The Moslem World*, which he edited, entitled "The Unoccupied Areas," openly clamoring:

    "There are many Muslims in China, mostly in northwestern China, but the missionary work covers less than one-fifth of the area of northwestern China." Therefore, they declared that they would "spread Christianity" in these "unoccupied areas."

    The article also stated that "there are also about one million Muslims in Vietnam and Burma, still outside the scope of the missionary movement."

    "In India, there are too few missionary centers in areas where Muslims are in the majority. For example, in Punjab and northwestern India, there are many areas where all or most of the residents are Muslims, but there is not a single missionary in those areas. The situation in Burma and Malaya is the same." The article also emphasized: "According to recent statistics, there are about 17 million Muslims in the Soviet Union, and there is not yet an organized organization responsible for spreading Christianity there."

    Therefore, the article clamored to "train a group of local people to serve as propagandists for Christianity," to "resist the forces of Islam and force it to take a defensive position."

    From this, it can be seen that American imperialism is determined to completely eliminate the entire Islamic religion—including Islam in China and the Soviet Union.

    They use various means against Muslims in various countries. The most common is to set up hospitals and schools to bewilder poor people and young children; the most vicious is to slander our prophet Muhammad in words and writing, falsely accusing him of spreading his religion by force, holding the Quran in his left hand and a sword in his right, and executing anyone who does not believe in Islam. They portray Muhammad as a great bully, thinking that in this way, not only will non-Muslims not convert to Islam, but also the faith of the original Muslims will waver. Their despicable propaganda has deceived our compatriots across the country, because the primary and secondary school textbooks during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries have helped them a great deal. In fact, Muhammad preached in Mecca for thirteen years, advising the Meccans not to drink, gamble, bully orphans, oppress women, abuse slaves, exploit the poor, be superstitious about ghosts and gods, and kill each other. He endured all kinds of persecution from the reactionaries. Finally, they wanted to kill him, and he fled to Medina, armed his disciples, and waged a resolute struggle against the enemy, finally eliminating the reactionaries and enabling the people of Arabia to gain freedom of religion. The Quran says: "There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has become clear from the wrong." (2:256) "And say, 'The truth is from your Lord, so whoever wills - let him believe; and whoever wills - let him disbelieve.'" (18:29) "Say, 'I am commanded to worship Allah, sincere to Him in religion, and I am commanded to be the first [among you] of the Muslims.' Worship what you will other than Him." (39:14, 15) How can the running dogs of American imperialism not recognize the teachings of Islam? How can they not know the history of Muhammad? But they only care about their goals and use any means necessary, knowingly distorting the truth and twisting the facts, just as they say that North Korea invaded South Korea. How hateful American imperialism is!

    Elders, brothers, and sisters of the Hui, Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Uzbek, Tatar, Tajik, Salar, and Dongxiang ethnic groups who believe in Islam! Rise up quickly, display your traditional spirit of struggle, contribute all your strength, eliminate bandits and special agents, resist American aggression, defend your religion, defend your motherland, and defend world peace.

### 美帝国主义是伊斯兰教的死敌

　　美帝国主义是伊斯兰教的死敌
    马坚
    美国发动了侵略朝鲜的战争之后，公开侵占我国的领土台湾，美国的飞机和军舰不断向我国挑衅，美国侵略朝鲜的军队已逼近我国东北边境，美国释放侵华战犯，并积极扶植日本，武装日本，同时，把大量的军火和物资运到台湾去援助人民公敌蒋介石。美帝国主义是中华人民共和国的死敌，这是铁一般的事实，全国的同胞，大概都知道了。至于美帝国主义对于伊斯兰教的阴谋，恐怕我们信奉伊斯兰教的同胞们还不大认识，故不能不加以揭发。
    亚洲和非洲上的人民，有很大的一部分是伊斯兰教徒。伊斯兰教是教人反抗侵略保卫和平的。古兰经说：“你们当为主道（真理、正义、人道）而抵抗进攻你们的人。”（二：一九○）“被攻击的人，已得抗战的许可，因为他们已受亏枉了。”（二二：三九）美帝国主义者要想奴役这些广大的伊斯兰教徒，不能不从文化侵略入手。他们妄想这些反抗侵略保卫和平的战士们，只要信仰基督教，就不会与恶人作对，有蛮横无理的人打他们的右脸一个耳光，他们一定会乖乖地把左脸送过去，到了那个时候，美帝国主义就可以剥削压迫，为所欲为了。
    一九三○年四月，美国的伊斯兰教“通”，兹威麦（Dr. S.M. Zwemer）在他所主编的伊斯兰教世界杂志（The Moslem World）上发表一篇社论，题目是：《尚未占领的面积》，公然叫嚣：
    “中国的伊斯兰教徒很多，大部分是在中国的西北部，但传教的工作范围，还不到中国西北部的五分之一的面积。”因此，它们宣称要在这些“尚未占领的面积”来“传布基督教”。
    该文还说到“在越南和缅甸，也有一百万左右的伊斯兰教徒，仍然在传教运动的范围之外。”
    “在印度，伊斯兰教徒占多数的区域里的传教中心，为数太少，例如：在判查布和印度的西北部，有许多区域，居民的全部或大部是伊斯兰教徒，但那些区域里，没有一个传教士。缅甸和马来亚的情形地是这样。”该文还着重提到：“苏联的伊斯兰教徒，据最近的统计，约有一千七百万人，那里还没有一个有组织的机构负责传布基督教。”
    因此，该文叫嚣要“训练一批本地人出来担任宣传基督教的工作”，“抵抗伊斯兰教的势力，而强迫它采取守势。”
    由此可见美帝国主义对于整个的伊斯兰教——连中国和苏联的伊斯兰教在内——是决心要全部加以消灭的。
    他们对各国的伊斯兰教徒运用种种不同的手段，最普通的是设医院、办学校，以迷惑贫苦的人民，和幼稚的儿童；最毒辣的是在口头上和文字上诽谤我们的教祖穆罕默德，诬蔑他以武力传教，左手执经，右手执剑，不信奉伊斯兰教的，都处以死刑。他们把穆罕默德描写成一个大恶霸，以为这样一来，不但外教人不会入教，就是原来的伊斯兰教徒的信仰也要发生动摇了。他们的这种卑鄙的宣传，已欺骗了我全国的同胞，因为国民党反动派统治时代的中小学教科书都给他们帮了很大的忙。其实，穆罕默德在墨克传道十三年，劝墨克人不要酗酒赌博，欺负孤儿，压迫妇女，虐待奴隶，剥削贫民，迷信鬼神，互相残杀。他忍受了反动派的种种迫害，最后，他们要杀害他，他才逃到默底纳去，把门弟子们武装起来，向敌人作坚决的斗争，终于消灭了反动派，使阿拉伯的人民获得信仰宗教的自由。古兰经说：“对于宗教，绝无强迫；因为正邪确已分明了。”（二：二五六）“这古兰经是从你们的主降示的真理；谁愿意信道，就让他信罢；谁不愿意信道，就让他不信罢。”（一八：二九）“你说：我只崇拜安拉，而且诚心归顺他。你们要舍他而崇拜什么，就崇拜什么罢。”（三九：一四，一五）美帝国主义的走狗们，何尝不认识伊斯兰教的教义，何尝不晓得穆罕默德的历史，但他们只问目的，不择手段，明知故违的颠倒是非，歪曲事实，正如他们说北朝鲜侵略南朝鲜一样，美帝国主义是多么的可恨啊！
    信奉伊斯兰教的回族、维吾尔族、哈萨克族、柯尔吉孜族、乌兹别克族、塔塔尔族、塔吉克族、撒拉族、东乡族的父老兄弟姊妹们！赶快起来，发挥你们斗争的传统精神，供献你们所有的力量，肃清土匪特务，抵抗美国侵略，保卫你们的宗教，保卫你们的祖国，保卫世界的和平。
