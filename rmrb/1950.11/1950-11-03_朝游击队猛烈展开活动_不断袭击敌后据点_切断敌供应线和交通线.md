　　朝游击队猛烈展开活动
    不断袭击敌后据点
    切断敌供应线和交通线
    【新华社一日讯】据朝鲜中央通讯社十月二十五日讯：成千成万的朝鲜人民游击队的战士们，抱着彻底消灭美国侵略军的坚强决心，正在敌人后方猛烈展开活动，到处挫败敌人的进犯，切断敌人后方的供应线和交通线，使敌人的有生力量和军火装备遭受巨大损失。
    在元山西北文川县一带山地活动的张智焕游击队，不断地奇袭元山的敌人后方供应基地和军事据点，破坏并烧毁堆积在码头上的许多军火装备，并截击敌人增援部队。十月二十一日，张智焕游击队的强大机动部队奇袭从元山向北进犯的敌军一个连，展开近五小时的炽烈战斗。他们冲到陷入混乱状态的敌军阵地，进行了纵横无阻的肉搏战。敌人遗弃卡车六辆和二十余具尸体仓惶逃窜。该游击队另一支有力部队则拦击混乱溃走的敌人的退路，也给予敌人很大打击。
    活跃在咸镜南道和平安南道边区山岳地带的文亨植游击部队，十月二十一日三面包围了正在集中的敌人一个营，加以激烈的攻击，使敌人不得不放弃集中兵力的企图，并向南溃退。
    又在咸镜南道西南方高原地区上活动的康镇游击部队，与人民取得紧密联系，深入敌人后方，进行游击活动，在一星期中共炸毁桥梁十一座，破坏道路五十多处，击毁敌人卡车二十多辆。
    到处展开激烈活动的游击部队，在广大人民的紧密协助下，正给予敌人沉重的打击，并有效地粉碎着彷徨山岳地带敌人的作战计划。
