　　Since launching its war of aggression against Korea, American imperialism has not only directly threatened our country's security and increasingly expanded the flames of its war of aggression, but also more actively pursued its plot for a separate peace treaty with Japan. In mid-September, Truman openly announced that he had authorized the State Department to prepare for a peace treaty with Japan and that the U.S. Far Eastern Commission should expedite the discussion of treaty procedures. On October 26, John Foster Dulles, advisor to the U.S. State Department and notorious warmonger, delivered a memorandum from the U.S. government on the issue of a peace treaty with Japan to Soviet representative to the Security Council, Malik. Although this memorandum from the U.S. government was delivered to the Soviet government, the people of our country cannot but express serious protest against the entire content proposed in the U.S. memorandum.
    The U.S. memorandum and the recent illegal announcement by MacArthur to release Japanese Class A war criminal Shigemitsu Mamoru once again prove that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people. The U.S. government is arrogantly attempting to foster the resurgence of Japanese fascist aggressive forces in the East, to expand aggression against Asia, and in particular to re-implement aggression against our country, completely obliterating the fruits of victory and all legitimate rights that the Chinese people gained through blood and sacrifice in the long War of Resistance Against Japan. This is something the Chinese people can never tolerate. Japanese imperialism has forged a blood feud with the Chinese people, just as the Kuomintang's Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, in collusion with the United States, has committed heinous crimes by massacring the Chinese people, which must be thoroughly liquidated. However, U.S. imperialism has no remorse whatsoever. In addition to directly engaging in aggression against China, it continues to intensify its support for Japanese aggressive forces and the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, attempting to use them to jointly attack the Chinese people. How can the Chinese people not hate U.S. imperialism to the bone?!
    We, the Chinese people, absolutely cannot tolerate the absurd principles proposed in the U.S. government's memorandum to the Soviet Union regarding the peace treaty with Japan.
    The U.S. memorandum proposes that the countries concluding the treaty with Japan are so-called "any or all of the countries at war with Japan willing to make peace on the basis of the proposed and possibly obtainable agreement." This is tantamount to excluding China and the Soviet Union, the two major victorious nations in the war against Japan, from the countries concluding the treaty. Because the terms of the peace treaty unilaterally formulated by the United States are obviously unacceptable to China and the Soviet Union. This action by the U.S. government completely abandons the solemn clause in the United Nations Declaration that it itself signed, which prohibits making a separate peace treaty with the enemy. The U.S. government even attempts to reintroduce Japanese aggressors into the United Nations. The U.S. memorandum openly declares that "membership for Japan in the United Nations will be considered." This means pulling the reactionary Japanese Yoshida government into the United Nations to serve as an accomplice of the United States.
    Regarding the issue of Japanese territory, the U.S. memorandum dares to blatantly obliterate the territorial sovereignty of China and the Soviet Union. It says: "Japan agrees to the United Nations trusteeship of the Ryukyu and Ogasawara Islands, with the United States as the administering authority"; "accepts the future decisions made by the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, China, and the United States regarding the status of Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, South Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands. If a decision cannot be reached within one year after the treaty takes effect, the United Nations General Assembly shall decide." The intention of this clause is very clear, which is to create a basis for the provocative behavior of the United States and Japan jointly seizing the territory of China and the Soviet Union and expanding aggression. It completely violates the provisions of the 1943 Cairo Declaration and the 1945 Potsdam Proclamation regarding the sovereignty of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands belonging to China, as well as the 1945 Yalta Agreement regarding the return of southern Sakhalin and adjacent islands to the Soviet Union and the transfer of the Kuril Islands to the Soviet Union. The United States has now actually occupied our country's territory, Taiwan Province, with its armed forces, and is openly attempting to occupy the Japanese Ryukyu Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Hasn't the U.S. government's shameless lie of "no intention of territorial expansion" been shattered by the facts?
    The U.S. memorandum also says: "Japan has a continuing responsibility to cooperate with the forces of the United States or other countries to maintain international peace and security in the Japanese area." This so-called responsibility for cooperation is precisely the excuse for a series of crimes currently being actively carried out by MacArthur, such as rearming Japan, establishing permanent bases in Japan, and illegally releasing Japanese war criminals. The 1949 Far Eastern Commission's resolution stipulating that Japan shall not possess land, sea, or air forces has actually been torn up by war criminal MacArthur.
    As for the so-called "Contracting Parties renounce all claims arising from war acts prior to September 2, 1945." This simply wants to completely wash away the immeasurable and painful sacrifices suffered by the Chinese people under the long-term aggression of Japan. This, of course, is also unacceptable to the Chinese people. The Chinese people are full of sympathy for the Japanese people and hope that the lives of the Japanese people will quickly return to prosperity, but the Japanese militarist aggressive forces must be dealt with, which is also in the interests of the Japanese people.
    In short, the U.S. memorandum shows that U.S. imperialism is preparing to continue expanding the flames of aggression in the Far East by using a separate peace treaty with Japan as a means. It disregards all sacred international constraints and follows the old path of the Japanese fascist aggressors. It wants to rebuild Japan's military power and establish permanent military bases in Japan as a springboard for aggression against China and the Soviet Union. It also wants to consolidate fascist rule in Japan and step up the suppression of democratic forces in Japan. U.S. imperialists have already mobilized Japanese manpower and resources in the war of aggression against Korea, shielded Yuhito and other germ warfare criminals, and extensively employed Japanese fascists as pawns in the war of aggression. These are more than enough to constitute heinous crimes by the American aggressors.
    We, the Chinese people, have personally experienced the suffering of long-term aggression by Japanese fascists, and we can no longer allow the United States to revive Japanese fascist forces. We demand that the righteous people of the world rise up and judge the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism. We firmly believe that for the sake of peace in Asia and peace in the world, the only path Japan should take is to realize demilitarization and democratization in accordance with the Potsdam Declaration, thereby restoring itself as a peaceful and democratic independent country.
    We insist on the signing of a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan, in accordance with the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance: "The two contracting parties guarantee that, with mutual consent, they will jointly obtain the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan together with the other Allied countries during the Second World War as soon as possible." This kind of comprehensive peace treaty with Japan is precisely what the Japanese people under the oppression of the American occupiers are eagerly demanding today. We support the demands of the Japanese people and hope to conclude a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible. We resolutely oppose the U.S. plot for a separate peace treaty with Japan. We fully support the principled position adhered to in the Soviet Union's memorandum to the U.S. government. We believe that China and the Soviet Union are not only the main victorious nations in the war against Japan, but also the closest geographically. A treaty without the participation of China and the Soviet Union is a completely illegal treaty! The U.S. imperialists' despicable trick will inevitably be shattered under the opposition of the people of China and the Soviet Union and the righteous people of the world!

### 坚决反对美国对日单独媾和的阴谋

　　坚决反对美国对日单独媾和的阴谋
    美国帝国主义者自从发动侵朝战争以来，不但直接威胁我国的安全，日益扩大它的侵略战争的火焰，而且愈加积极地进行着对日单独媾和的阴谋活动。九月中旬，杜鲁门公开宣布授权国务院进行对日和约的准备，并且要美国远东委员会赶速讨论和约的程序问题。十月二十六日美国国务院顾问，臭名昭彰的战争贩子杜勒斯以美国政府关于对日和约问题的备忘录一件递交苏联驻安理会代表马立克。美国政府的这个备忘录，虽然是递交苏联政府的，但是我国人民对于美国备忘录所提出的全部内容，不能不表示严重的抗议。
    美国的备忘录和最近麦克阿瑟非法宣布释放日本甲级战犯重光葵的事件，又一次地证明了美帝国主义是中国人民不共戴天的敌人。美国政府狂妄地企图在东方扶植日本法西斯侵略势力再起，扩大对亚洲的侵略，特别是重新对我国实行侵略，完全抹杀我国人民在长期抗日战争中流血牺牲所换来的胜利果实和一切正当权利，这是中国人民所决不能容忍的。日本帝国主义与我国人民结下了血海深仇，正如国民党蒋介石匪帮勾结美国屠杀中国人民所造成的弥天罪恶一样，是必须加以彻底清算的。但是美帝国主义丝毫没有悔祸之心，除了自己向中国直接进行侵略以外，并且继续变本加厉地扶植日本侵略势力和蒋介石残余匪帮，企图利用它们来共同进攻中国人民，这叫中国人民怎么能够不把美帝国主义恨入骨髓呢？！
    我们中国人民，对于美国政府致苏联的备忘录中所提出的关于对日和约的那些荒唐的原则是绝对不能容忍的。
    美国的备忘录提出对日缔约国家是所谓“任何或一切愿意在所建议的和可能获得协议的基础上媾和的对日作战国家”。这就等于把中国和苏联这两个主要的对日战胜国排斥于缔约国家之外。因为美国单独制定的和约条件，显然是中国和苏联所不能同意的。美国政府的这种举动，完全毁弃了它自己所签署的联合国宣言中不与敌国单独媾和这一个庄严条款。甚至于美国政府还企图把日本侵略者重新引入联合国。美国的备忘录公然宣称在联合国中，“对日本的会籍将予以考虑”。这就是要把反动的日本吉田政府拉进联合国去，充当美国的帮凶。
    关于日本的领土问题，美国的备忘录竟敢悍然抹杀中国和苏联的领土主权。它说：“日本同意由联合国托管琉球小笠原群岛，而以美国为管理当局”；“接受大不列颠联合王国、苏联、中国及美国将来所作关于台湾、澎湖列岛、南库页岛与千岛群岛的地位的决定。如果在条约生效后一年以内不能获得决定时，则由联合国大会决定之”。这一项的用意十分明显，就是要给美国和日本联合夺取中国和苏联领土的挑衅行为和扩大侵略制造根据。它完全违背了一九四三年的开罗宣言和一九四五年的波茨坦公告中关于台湾和澎湖列岛的主权归属中国的规定，以及一九四五年雅尔塔协定中关于库页岛南部和邻近岛屿交还苏联以及把千岛群岛移交苏联的规定。美国现在已经用它的武装实际侵占了我国的领土台湾省，并且公然企图占领日本的琉球群岛和小笠原群岛。杜鲁门政府所谓“没有扩张领土之意”的无耻谎言不是已经被事实打得粉碎了吗？
    美国的备忘录又说：“日本的设备与美国的或其他军队之间有继续合作以维持日本地区的国际和平与安全的责任”。这所谓合作的责任，正是目前麦克阿瑟所积极进行的重新武装日本和在日本建立永久基地以及非法释放日本战犯等一系列罪行的借口。一九四九年远东委员会规定日本不得保有陆、海、空军的决议，实际上已被战犯麦克阿瑟所撕毁了。
    至于所谓“缔约各方放弃在一九四五年九月二日以前因战争行为而产生的权利要求”。这简直是想把中国人民在日本的长期侵略下所受到的无可估计的惨痛牺牲，完全付之流水了。这当然也是中国人民所不能忍受的。中国人民对于日本人民充满同情，希望日本人民的生活迅速恢复繁荣，但是对于日本军国主义侵略势力，却必须加以处置，这也正是日本人民的利益所要求的。
    总之，美国的备忘录表明了美国帝国主义者正在准备单独对日媾和为手段，继续扩大远东侵略的战火。它不顾一切国际间神圣的约束，走着日本法西斯侵略者的老路。它要重建日本的武力，在日本设立永久军事基地作为侵略中国和苏联的跳板。它还要巩固在日本的法西斯统治，加紧镇压日本民主势力。美国帝国主义者在侵朝战争中已经动员着日本的人力和资源，包庇着裕仁等细菌战犯，并且大量起用了日本法西斯分子，充当侵略战争的走卒，这些已足以构成美国侵略者的弥天大罪而有余了。
    我们中国人民切身经历了日本法西斯长期侵略的苦难，再也不能让美国把日本法西斯势力复活起来，我们要求全世界正义的人民起来审判美帝国主义的弥天罪行。我们深信，为了亚洲的和平，为了世界的和平，日本应走的唯一的道路，就是根据波茨坦宣言，实现非军事化与民主化，从而恢复为一个和平与民主的独立国家。
    我们坚持主张签订全面的对日和约，按照中苏友好同盟互助条约中所规定的：“缔约国双方保证经过彼此同意与第二次世界战争时期其他同盟国于尽可能的短期内共同取得对日和约的缔结”。这一种对日的全面和约正是今日在美国占领者压迫下的日本人民所热切要求的。我们支持日本人民的要求，希望从早缔结对日的全面和约。我们坚决反对美国单独对日媾和的阴谋。我们完全拥护苏联给美国政府的备忘录所坚持的原则立场。我们认为中苏两国不但是对日的主要战胜国，而且在地理上也是最邻近的。没有中苏两国参加的和约就是完全非法的和约！美帝国主义卑鄙的骗局必将在中苏两国人民和全世界正义人民的反对之下归于破灭！
