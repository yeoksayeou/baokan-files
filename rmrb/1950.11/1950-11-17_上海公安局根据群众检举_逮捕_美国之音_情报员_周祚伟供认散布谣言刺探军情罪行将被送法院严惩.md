　　Shanghai Public Security Bureau, Based on Public Tip-Offs, Arrests "Voice of America" Informant
　　Zhou Zuowei Confesses to Spreading Rumors and Espionage, to be Severely Punished by the Court
　　[Report from this newspaper] According to the Shanghai Liberation Daily: While expanding its aggression, American imperialism is once again utilizing the notorious rumor-mongering company "Voice of America" to spread a large number of rumors to slander the people in order to cooperate with its aggressive conspiracies. Recently, rumors have been rampant in Shanghai. Investigating their origin, in addition to a portion being the planned conspiracy activities of the remnants of the American imperialist running dog Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and secret agents, another source is the "Voice of America." The people of Shanghai from all walks of life have recently been advocating to stop listening to "Voice of America" and eradicate bandit and secret agent rumors, which is a concrete manifestation of our entire nation's hatred of American imperialism and taking practical actions to resist America, aid Korea, and protect our homes and country.
　　In order to thoroughly crush the bandit and secret agent rumor-mongering and sabotage activities, the Shanghai Municipal Security Authorities have been vigorously deploying investigations to trace the source of the rumors in recent days. For bandit and secret agent elements lurking in our area, collecting intelligence, creating rumors, and supplying them to the American imperialists and Chiang bandits, it has been decided to severely suppress them. The Shanghai Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau recently, based on public tip-offs and after careful investigation, has arrested Zhou Zuowei, an informant for "Voice of America" lurking in the city, and confiscated three drafts of intelligence reports sent under the pseudonym "Cen" to the "American Consulate General" in Hong Kong for forwarding to "Voice of America," as well as a twelve-tube shortwave radio used to facilitate criminal activities.
　　The criminal Zhou Zuowei, 28 years old, is from Dinghai, Zhejiang Province. Born into a wealthy family, he received a long-term slave-like education from American imperialists and Chiang bandits. His ideology has always been reactionary, and his behavior has been improper. After liberation, he obstructed and sabotaged patriotic movements such as the broad masses of people's anti-blockade and anti-bombing support for the front lines, as well as the People's Government's policies on public bond taxation, adjustment of public-private relations, and so on. Recently, the people's movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes and country is being widely carried out in this city. Zhou dared to use materials from listening to "Voice of America" to spread rumors among the masses, stir up trouble, and carry out reactionary propaganda for American imperialism. When the flames of aggression of American imperialism gradually extended to our country's borders, arousing the incomparable anger of the people of the whole country, Zhou intensified his efforts. In addition to sparing no effort in conspiracy activities such as creating rumors and slander, he also probed into our national defense military secrets, political and economic measures, and the movements of the People's Government leaders to supply intelligence to the American imperialists. Zhou confessed that he had successively delivered five intelligence reports to the "American Consulate General" in Hong Kong for forwarding to "Voice of America." In the confiscated drafts, Zhou actually recognized the enemy as his father, praising the American imperialist aggressor army in Korea as the "United Nations Police Force," saying that the American imperialist aggressive behavior is the current "effective measure." In order to ingratiate himself with imperialism, he shamelessly pretended to ask the American imperialists to "introduce" him to join the "United Nations Police Force" to "serve" them. In his letters to the American imperialists, he provided a lot of intelligence, and after fabricating some rumors and dirty words, he repeatedly begged "Voice of America" to spread these toxins to mainland China with a servile attitude. These crimes are intolerable to the people of the whole country.
　　Under ironclad evidence, Zhou has confessed to the above crimes. It is reported that the Municipal Public Security Bureau will transfer him to the People's Court for severe punishment according to the law, and hopes that people from all walks of life will automatically report rumor-mongering illegal elements to assist the government in extinguishing bandit and secret agent rumors, stabilize social order, and participate in the actual struggle to resist America and aid Korea with practical actions!

　　上海公安局根据群众检举
    逮捕“美国之音”情报员           
    周祚伟供认散布谣言刺探军情罪行将被送法院严惩
    【本报讯】据上海解放日报消息：美帝国主义在其扩大侵略的同时，复利用臭名昭著的造谣公司“美国之音”，大量传播各种谣言污蔑人民，以配合其侵略阴谋。近来上海市谣言蜂起，追究其来源，除了一部分是美帝走狗蒋匪残余特务有计划的阴谋活动外，还有一个来源，就是“美国之音”。本市各界人民连日纷纷主张制止收听“美国之音”，根绝匪特谣言，正是我全国人民仇视美帝，以实际行动抗美援朝保家卫国的具体表现之一。
    上海市治安当局为彻底粉碎匪特造谣破坏活动，连日来曾大力布置侦缉，追查谣言根源。对于潜伏我区搜集情报、制造谣言，供给美帝蒋匪之匪特分子，决定予以严厉镇压。上海市人民政府公安局最近根据群众检举，复经周密侦察，已将潜伏本市的“美国之音”情报员周祚伟逮捕，抄获用化名“岑”送递香港“美国总领事馆”转交“美国之音”的情报底稿三件，及其用以配合犯罪活动的十二灯短波收音机一只。
    该犯周祚伟，二十八岁，浙江定海人，出身纨裤子弟，受过美帝蒋匪的长期奴化教育，一贯思想反动，行为不正。解放后，对于广大人民反封锁反轰炸支援前线等爱国运动，及人民政府公债税收调整公私关系等政策，均曾多方阻挠破坏。最近本市人民抗美援朝保家卫国运动正在广泛展开，周犯竟胆敢利用收听“美国之音”的材料，在群众中散布谣言，兴风作浪，替美帝国主义进行反动宣传。当美帝国主义的侵略火焰逐渐伸至我国边境，引起全国人民无比愤怒的时候，周犯更变本加厉，除了造谣污蔑等阴谋活动不遗余力外，并刺探我国防军事机密、政治经济措施及人民政府首长动态等情报供给美帝。周犯自供曾先后投递香港“美国总领事馆”转“美国之音”情报五封。在抄获的底稿中，周犯居然毫无人性的认贼作父，称颂美帝在朝鲜侵略军为“联合国警察队”，谓美帝的侵略行为是目前的“有效措置”。为谄媚帝国主义，更无耻地装腔作势请求美帝“介绍”他加入“联合国警察队”，为其“效劳”。他在写给美帝的信件中供给了许多情报，并编造若干谣言与污词后，还一再奴颜婢膝地请求“美国之音”将这些毒素向中国大陆散播。这些罪行，是我全国人民所不能容忍的。
    周犯在铁的证据下，对上述罪行均已供认不讳，闻市公安局即将移请人民法院依法予以严惩，并希望各界市民自动检举造谣不法分子，以协助政府扑灭匪特谣言，安定社会秩序，用实际行动来参加抗美援朝的实际斗争！
