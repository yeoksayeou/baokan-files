　　Xinjiang Students in Beijing Resolve to Resist America and Aid Korea

　　[This Newspaper] Students from various ethnic groups in Xinjiang studying in Beijing jointly wrote a letter to this newspaper expressing their determination to resist America and aid Korea, and defend their homes and country. The original letter is as follows: Comrade Editor:
　　The various acts of aggression committed by the American imperialists against our country have aroused the anger of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. For more than four months, while frantically invading democratic Korea, the American imperialists have blatantly invaded our Taiwan, and then set the flames of the war of aggression against Korea ablaze on our national border, repeatedly violating our airspace and bombing and strafing our peaceful cities and peaceful people. Recently, they blatantly clamored to invade our territory and shamelessly denied that the Yalu River is the boundary between China and Korea, which makes us intolerable! We, the minority youth who have come to the capital to study, love peace as much as the people of the whole country, but we never have been and never will be afraid to resist wars of aggression. We unanimously believe that the American imperialists are the most hateful and despicable enemy of all ethnic groups in China, and the public enemy of the people of the world! In order to defend the security of the motherland and defend world peace, we have decided to join the ranks of young people aiding Korea and go to Korea to resolutely fight to defeat the American imperialists. At the same time, we loudly appeal: Young comrades of all brotherly ethnic groups in China, rise up, rise up to resist America and aid Korea, and defend our homes and country! Warmly respond to the declarations of the various democratic parties!

　　新疆各族来京学习学生
　　致函本报决心抗美援朝
    【本报讯】新疆各族来京学习学生联合写信给本报表示决心抗美援朝，保家卫国。原信如下：编辑同志：
    美帝国主义者向我国所作的种种侵略行为，激起了我们全国各民族人民的愤怒。四个多月来，美帝国主义者在疯狂地侵略民主朝鲜同时，又明目张胆地侵略了我们的台湾，接着又把侵略朝鲜的战争火焰燃烧到我们的国境边上来，多次侵犯我们领空，轰炸和扫射我们的和平城市及和平人民。最近又公然叫嚣侵犯我国领土，无耻地否认鸭绿江是中朝两国的国界，这使我们忍无可忍！我们来到首都学习的少数民族青年和全国人民一样热爱和平，但从不也永远不害怕反抗侵略战争。我们一致认为，美帝国主义者是我们中国各民族最可恨可鄙的敌人，是全世界人民的公敌！为了保卫祖国的安全和保卫世界和平，我们决定加入援助朝鲜的青年行列，前赴朝鲜为打垮美帝国主义者而坚决奋斗。同时我们大声疾呼：中国各兄弟民族的青年同志们起来，起来抗美援朝，保家卫国！热烈响应各民主党派宣言！
