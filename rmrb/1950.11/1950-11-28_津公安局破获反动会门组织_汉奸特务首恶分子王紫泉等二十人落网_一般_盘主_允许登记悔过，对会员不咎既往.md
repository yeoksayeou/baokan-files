　　Tianjin Public Security Bureau Uncovers Reactionary Secret Society Organization
    Traitorous Special Agent Chief Culprit Wang Ziquan and Twenty Others Arrested
    Ordinary "Panzhu" Allowed to Register Repentance, Members Not Held Accountable
    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Tianjin Daily News: In order to suppress reactionaries and protect the people, the Tianjin Public Security Bureau completely cracked down on the "World New Buddhist Church" reactionary organization, which had been active in Tianjin for many years, on the 23rd of this month; arresting the chief culprit, the association's president Wang Ziquan, and "Fo Pan leaders" Jia Qinglin, Li Guirong, and twenty others. The deputy leader Tang Xianglin is at large. One "Zhong Huang" seal was confiscated, along with other seals, reactionary spirit-writing oracles, books, certificates, and other items.
    This reactionary secret society, the "World New Buddhist Church," was formerly the "Longhua Buddhist Church" during the enemy-puppet period. The notoriously traitorous Chu Minyi originally served as its honorary chairman, with Wang Ziquan as its president. They colluded with the Japanese invaders, betrayed national interests, spared no effort in propagating the "Greater East Asia War" for the Japanese invaders, and shamelessly held memorial services for the "fallen soldiers" of the Japanese invaders. Due to his meritorious flattery of the Japanese invaders, Okamura Neji, the top war criminal who invaded China, once presented Wang with a "Good Person Plaque." Wang relied on the power of the Japanese invaders to expand his organization and amass wealth. After the Japanese invaders surrendered, he colluded with the Kuomintang reactionaries, undergoing a transformation to become a Chiang Kai-shek spy. Due to his notorious reputation during the enemy-puppet period, which drew condemnation from everyone, he changed the name to the "World New Buddhist Church," with the special agent Hao Yulin serving as chairman. Wang was responsible for the association's affairs and cultivated connections with key Chiang Kai-shek special agents, such as Wu Jingzhong of the Central Bureau of Statistics, Chen Xianzou, the chief of the Bandit Inspection Office, and Zeng Jialin, the commander of the Bandit Military Police 20th Regiment, carrying out anti-people criminal activities. The spy chiefs Dai Li and Chiang Ching-kuo also stayed at Wang's home when they came to Tianjin. In 1946, Wang led a group of deceived followers, carrying nineteen apricot yellow flags, to Minyuan to celebrate Chiang Kai-shek's birthday. Afterward, he met with Chiang Kai-shek, further ingratiating himself with the Kuomintang reactionary regime, praising the traitorous "Chiang Kai-shek regime as the most humane," slandering the people's government's land reform policy, spreading rumors to deceive the association's members, saying that Wang Ziquan was "a living Buddha descended to earth," that "the Queen Mother wants to build a Peach Garden Palace," and that "disciples should quickly cultivate blessings," defrauding ignorant members of their family fortunes. Wang and others used the collected wealth to open shops, purchase residences, smoke opium, play with women, and squander it at will.
    After the liberation of Tianjin, these criminals continued to engage in their anti-people criminal activities without repentance, recruiting Chiang Kai-shek's scattered soldiers and local despots to expand the reactionary organization, using spirit-writing oracles to spread rumors and deceive the masses, and instructing their subordinates to infiltrate our revolutionary organizations, attempting to conceal themselves for a long time to gather confidential information and wait for an opportunity to riot. On a certain day in April of this year, the association's "Panzhu" deceived and intimidated his followers, saying: "Soon, all religions will be united, and all religions will start (meaning riot)." Wang further instructed his subordinates to "actively infiltrate the Eighth Route Army to seek cover." He also actively recruited members from landlords and Chiang Kai-shek's scattered soldiers in other areas, attempting to expand the organization and prepare for a riot.
    Since the U.S. imperialists' armed aggression against Korea and Taiwan, Wang and others believed that the opportunity was approaching, and they rampantly spread rumors, incited people's hearts, and actively prepared to cooperate with the U.S. imperialists' aggression, plotting a riot.
    Based on the policy of combining suppression and leniency, the Municipal People's Government, in addition to destroying its reactionary organization and arresting and severely punishing a small number of chief culprits according to law, allows ordinary "Panzhu" to repent and should register with the respective sub-bureaus within twenty days from today; ordinary members who have been deceived into joining the association, as long as they recognize the reactionary face of the association and voluntarily withdraw from the association, the government will not hold them accountable.

　　津公安局破获反动会门组织
    汉奸特务首恶分子王紫泉等二十人落网
    一般“盘主”允许登记悔过，对会员不咎既往
    【本报讯】据天津日报讯：津市公安局为镇压反动分子，保护人民，于本月二十三日将在津活动有年之“世界新佛教会”反动组织全部破获；逮捕首恶分子该会会长王紫泉及“佛盘领主”贾庆林、李桂荣等二十名。外副领主汤相林在逃。查抄“中皇”印一颗，及其他印信反动乩语、书籍、证件等一部。
    按该反动会门“世界新佛教会”，其前身即敌伪时期的“龙华佛教会”，原以臭名昭著的汉奸褚民谊为名誉理事长，王紫泉自任会长，勾结日寇，叛卖民族利益，对日寇进行“大东亚战争”宣传不遗余力，并卑鄙无耻地为日寇“阵亡将士”开追悼亡魂大会。由于献媚日寇有功，侵华头等战犯冈村宁次曾赠与王犯“善人匾”。王犯更依恃日寇势力，扩充组织，搜刮钱财。日寇投降后，又与国民党反动派勾结，摇身一变，而为蒋匪特务。因碍于敌伪时期臭名昭著，人人指骂，乃改名为“世界新佛教会”，由特务郝遇林充理事长；王犯负责会务，并广结蒋匪特务首要分子，如中统吴景中等，匪稽查处长陈仙洲、匪宪兵二十团团长曾家麟等进行反人民的罪恶活动。特务头子戴笠、蒋经国来津亦曾住过王犯家中。一九四六年王犯率领被骗徒众，打着十九面杏黄旗，到民园为蒋匪祝寿，之后面见蒋匪，进一步取宠于国民党反动政权，歌颂卖国贼“蒋介石政权是最人道的”，诬蔑人民政府的土改政策，造谣欺骗该会会员，说王紫泉是“活佛下凡”，“王母要修蟠桃宫”，“子弟们快种福田”，骗取无知会员倾家破产捐献钱财。王犯等则以聚敛之财，开设商店，置买宅第，吸食鸦片，玩弄女人，任意挥霍。
    天津解放后，该犯等仍怙恶不悛，继续进行其反人民的罪恶活动，网罗蒋匪流散军人及地主恶霸等扩充反动组织，利用乩语造谣欺骗群众，并指使所属打入我革命组织，企图长期掩护探听机密，待机暴动。于本年四月某日，该会“盘主”欺骗恫吓徒众说：“马上就要万教归一，万教起手（即暴动之意）”。王犯更指示其所属“应积极打入八路军内部，以求掩护。”并积极往外地以地主及蒋匪流散军人为对象吸收会员，妄图扩充组织，准备暴动力量。
    自美帝武装侵略朝鲜、台湾以来，王犯等认为时机逼近，更大肆散布谣言，煽惑人心，积极准备配合美帝的侵略行动，阴谋暴动。
    市人民政府根据镇压与宽大相结合的政策，除摧毁其反动组织，对其少数首恶分子予以逮捕依法严惩外，一般“盘主”允其悔过，应自即日起二十日内至各该管分局进行登记；一般被骗入会会员，只要认清该会反动面目，自动退出会门，政府不咎既往。
