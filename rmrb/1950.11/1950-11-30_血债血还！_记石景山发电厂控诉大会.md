Blood Debt Must Be Paid!
    ——A Record of the Accusation Meeting at the Shijingshan Power Plant
    Wang Zimian·Li Ximing·Wang Lixing
    A week ago, the workers of the Shijingshan Power Plant held a very tragic accusation meeting. Recalling those years of blood and tears under the rule of imperialism and its running dogs, hatred surged from their hearts.

    During the era of Japanese occupation, the workers wore麻片（coarse hemp clothing）, used cement paper bags to make trousers, endured the winter, suffered beatings and abuse, and were buried alive in small ditches. The mountain沟旁 （ravines） beside the power plant were piled with corpses, and the eyes of more than a dozen wild dogs were red from eating.

    On the evening of November 23rd, all the factory workers held a meeting in the repair shop to accuse the crimes of imperialism. The suffering people leaned against lathes, drilling machines, and planers, their hearts twisted with endless sorrow. Beside the rostrum were two large paintings, one depicting the fierce visages of Japanese寇 （bandits） and American帝 （imperialists） with knives in their mouths, and the other depicting Chinese people who had been shot, whipped, burned, and raped; on the wall were the four large characters “Blood Debt Must Be Paid.”

    Slips of paper requesting to make accusations were sent to the stage like snowflakes. The first to accuse was electrician Tian Quanlian. He said: "I'm here to tell you about my suffering. My family was poor peasants. We borrowed fifty yuan from the landlord. When we went to repay him, he didn't want the money, he insisted on seizing my older sister. My older sister ran away, and we still haven't heard from her. My own sister, we can't see her alive, and we won't even see her coffin when she dies! My father and mother became ill with anger and died because we had no money for treatment!" I went to work at the Liujiang Coal Mine, and one year and three months went by without any pay. How could workers live without money? We had to eat tree bark, tree leaves, and bean flour, and we still got beaten and cursed! Under the rule of Japanese imperialism, Chinese workers were worse than donkeys, worse than dogs, what kind of life was that! When the War of Resistance was won, I also lost my job! I had no food to eat, and I even sold my wife's clothes! I tried to sell salt, but in Fengtai, the salt was seized by Kuomintang特务（secret agents）. I took everyone to demand it back. Salt was our life, we had to have it. The特务（secret agents） drove everyone away with whips. Me and two women didn't leave, so we were arrested and taken inside, stripped of our clothes, and whipped with leather whips. They asked me if I wanted it back, and I said I would rather be beaten to death than give up. They beat me unconscious and poured cold water on me. But my suffering is nothing compared to what's happening in Korea, where American帝 （imperialists） are slaughtering and oppressing people. What kind of lives are the Korean people living?!" His voice was hoarse, and the meeting place was filled with weeping. Old worker Chen Yuchun accused the fact that the Eight-Nation Alliance had occupied Beijing during the庚子年间 （Gengzi Year/Boxer Rebellion), and that American鬼子 （devils） had drowned his two aunts and killed three of his uncles. He then continued: "I had a younger brother, and we saved every penny to send him to school. Before he even graduated from elementary school, he was captured and killed by the Japanese, and his head was nailed to the city gate. I didn't dare to cry when I saw it, and I went to steal his body at night. His clothes were even stripped off after he died. I carried him for a while, and the more I thought about it, the sadder I became, and I said, 'Let your brother go with you,' my brother!" As he said this, he fainted, and the workers all burst into tears.

    The Imperialists regarded Chinese workers as worse than dogs. When old worker Li Huating was a servant, he picked up a fish bone that a Japanese man had left after eating, and the Japanese man made him kneel to a foreign dog for ten hours. Another time, the Japanese寇 （bandits） lost money and falsely accused him of stealing it, kicking him and whipping him for three hours. If the Japanese寇 （bandits） hadn't found the money themselves later, they would have fed him to the foreign dogs! Youth League member Song Wenfa said: "When I was thirteen years old, I went to work as a messenger in the steel factory. As soon as I entered the door, a Japanese man slapped me. When they lost something, they locked me up in the garrison headquarters. It was really hard to be a slave of a fallen country. Today, the American帝 （imperialists） want us to be slaves of a fallen country again. We must drive them back. Wherever the motherland needs me, I will go."

    As soon as old worker Gao Shirong took the stage, he was heartbroken: "I was born during the time of the Eight-Nation Alliance, and my parents begged for food everywhere. When we returned home, the walls had collapsed and the house had collapsed, and we couldn't live there. My grandfather died, and my grandmother went to Tianjin to do small business. One day, she was sitting at home. A foreign鬼子 （devil） was bitten by a puppy. The puppy ran into the courtyard where my grandmother lived, and the foreign鬼子 （devil） came in and kicked my grandmother, making her roll all over the ground. One night, my father went to empty the water bucket and was beaten by a foreign鬼子 （devil） , and his face was covered with blood. When I was fifteen years old, I was taking a rest outside as an apprentice and was beaten by an American鬼子 （devil）. Later, I went to work at the power plant and was fired by the Japanese鬼子 （devils）. When I went to work at the steel factory, I was beaten by the Japanese鬼子 （devils） until my nose and mouth were bleeding, and I was sick for several months. I didn't have food for three days. My eleven-year-old daughter picked coal焦 （coke） and sold it for a窝窝头 （corn bun）, and my son and I shared it. Only today can we eat our fill and wear warm clothes. Who gave it to us? The Communist Party, Chairman Mao. If we don't work hard in the future, how can we be worthy of the soldiers bleeding on the front lines, how can we be worthy of Chairman Mao." As he said this, he also fainted.

    Old worker Wang Zhenyu from the coal dust furnace talked about the suffering his younger brother endured when he was a worker in Tianjin. One day, on the way home, his leg was broken by an American car on the side of the road. The house next to it was also knocked down. The American soldiers said: the person and the house were "blocking the way"! American imperialism is even more ferocious than the Japanese寇 （bandits） ! Wang Zhenyu himself had fished in Tianjin. Once, he sold a pound of fish to a Japanese特务 （secret agent）. The特务 （secret agent） took out all the fish intestines, but said the weight was not enough, and beat him until his face and mouth were broken. He said: "When I went back to see my father, my father was so angry that he died. We sold the house to buy a coffin. Later, the Japanese狗腿子 （lackeys） forced me to sell my house. At that time, I was outside. When I went home, I saw the door locked. I didn't know where my wife and children, a family of five, had gone. My eighteen-year-old daughter, my twelve-year-old son, my six-year-old daughter, I never saw them again! My father also died, it was truly a broken family. It was really hard to be a person at that time: the Japanese鬼子 （devils） beat you for nothing, the American鬼子 （devils） kicked you for nothing. If we hadn't been liberated, we would have had nowhere to pour out our bitterness for the rest of our lives. Without Chairman Mao's leadership, we would never have dreamed of having today. I am fifty years old, and I have never seen the Chinese people so united. Now we are building dormitories, building buildings, building elementary schools for the children, and running vocational schools for the workers. Did such a world exist under imperialist rule?" Then he said loudly: "The American帝 （imperialists） are attacking Korea and attacking us again today, we must never let them!"

    Xiao Fengsen, a blueprint worker in the production technology section, used to be a painter. He fell and cut a large gash in his head while painting the former American Embassy. The "American Ambassador" dirtied his own clothes, and locked Xiao Fengsen in a dark room for half a day. When painting for the Japanese, he was kicked down by the Japanese and almost died. They didn't give him his wages, and his father died of anger, and his mother also died. After coming to the power plant, his fifteen-year-old daughter was raped by Kuomintang bandits, and he was dragged out and beaten, the bandits said he was a "Eighth Route Army" and wanted to kill him. Crane worker Dong Liwang said: "My older brother was kicked to death by the landlord. When we went to sue, the yamen (government office in feudal China) was on the landlord's side. When the Japanese came to "sweep", I ran away. My mother begged for food for more than ten years, and was eventually beaten to death by the landlord, and they chased and killed my father. My father ran away, and our family didn't have anything to cook for more than ten days! I lived to be over twenty years old without ever having a quilt, only covering myself with mats woven from sorghum; elm leaves, locust flowers, willow leaves, we ate them all. Today, we are finally living a happy life, and the American帝 （imperialists） want us to be slaves of a fallen country again, we must resolutely eliminate them." The workers' eternal and irreconcilable hatred for the imperialists has been transformed into an irresistible force. Working hard in production and supporting the front lines, this is the practical protest of the people against American aggression.

　　血债血还！
    ——记石景山发电厂控诉大会
    王自勉·李锡铭·王立行
    一周前，石景山发电厂的工人们进行了十分悲壮的控诉会。人们回忆起那些在帝国主义及其走狗统治下的血泪岁月，仇恨就从心里上来。
    在日寇统治的时代，工人们身上披着麻片，拿洋灰纸袋围一条裤子，过着寒冬，挨打受气，还活着就被埋到小沟里。发电厂旁的山沟里，堆满了死尸，十多条野狗眼睛都吃红了。
    十一月二十三日晚，全厂职工在修理车间，召开了控诉帝国主义罪恶大会，受苦的人们靠着旋床、钻床、刨床，心里绞腾着无限辛酸。主席台旁两幅大画，一幅是日寇、美帝含着刀的凶像，一幅是被枪杀、鞭打、火烧、强奸的中国人民；墙上是“血债血还”四个大字。
    要求控诉的纸条雪片一样地往台上送。第一个控诉的是电工田泉廉。他说：“我来把我的苦诉一诉，我家是贫农，借了地主五十块钱，还地主钱他不要，硬要霸占我的姐姐。我姐姐逃走了，直到现在还没有信息。亲生的姐姐，生不能见面，死也见不到一口棺材！父亲母亲气病了，没有钱治，都死了！”我去到柳江煤矿做工，有一年三个月没有开工钱，工人没钱怎能活？吃树皮树叶豆面还要挨打挨骂！日本帝国主义的统治下，咱中国工人不如驴，不如狗，那是什么生活！抗战胜利了，我也失业了！没饭吃，把老婆衣服都卖了！设法去卖盐，在丰台被国民党特务把盐截去，我带着大伙儿去要。盐就是命，不要不成。特务用鞭子把大伙赶跑，我和两个妇女没走，被捉了进去，扒下衣服，用皮鞭抽，问我要不要，我说打死我才不要。他们把我打昏了，用凉水浇。可是，我这点苦还不大，美帝在朝鲜屠杀压迫，朝鲜老百姓怎样过？！”他的声音嘶哑了，会场上哭成一片。老工友陈玉春控诉了庚子年间八国联军进占北京，美国鬼子淹死他的两个姑姑和杀死三个大爷叔叔的事实之后，他接着说：“我有一个弟弟，我们省吃俭用，供他上学。高小还没有毕业，被日本人捉去杀了，头钉在城门上。我见着不敢哭，晚上去偷尸。人死了衣服还被扒光了。我背了一段，心里越想越难过，说你哥哥和你一块去吧，我的弟弟呀！”说到这里人就昏过去了，工友们也都嚎啕大哭。
    帝国主义把中国工人看成比狗还不如，老工友李华庭当工役时，拾了日本人饭后一根鱼刺，日本人让他给洋狗跪了十个钟头。又一次日寇丢了钱，诬赖他偷的，脚踢鞭子抽打了三个小时。要是日寇后来自己不把钱找着，就要把他喂洋狗！青年团员宋文发说：“十三岁那年进钢铁厂当听差，一进门日本人就是一个耳光，他们丢了东西，把我关进警备司令部去。亡国奴实在不好当啊，今天美帝又要让我们当亡国奴了，我们要打他回去，祖国需要我到那里，我就到那里。”
    老工友高士荣一上台就伤心：“我刚生下来就闹八国联军，父母四处讨饭，回家后墙倒屋塌，没法生活。祖父死了，祖母到天津做小买卖。有一天在家里坐着。一个洋鬼子被小狗咬了。小狗逃到我祖母住的院里，洋鬼子进来，踢着我祖母满地打滚。我父亲有天晚上倒水桶去，被洋鬼子打得满脸是血。我十五岁当学徒时，在外乘凉，被美国鬼子打一顿。后来我到发电厂做工，又被日本鬼子开除了。到钢铁厂做工，被日本鬼子打得鼻口都流血，还病了几个月。三天没有吃上饭，我十一岁的女儿检煤焦，卖了钱换一个窝窝头，我们爷儿俩分着吃，熬到今天才能吃饱穿暖，谁给的？共产党，毛主席。今后要不努力干怎样对得起前方流血的战士，怎样对得起毛主席。”说到这里，他也气昏了。
    煤粉炉老工友王振宇谈到他弟弟在天津当工人时所受的苦。有一天在回家的路上，在边道被美国汽车轧断了腿。旁边的房子也被撞塌了。美国兵说：人和房子“挡道”！美国帝国主义比日寇还凶残！王振宇自己曾在天津打过鱼。一次卖一斤鱼给日本特务。特务把鱼肠子全扒出去，却说份量不够，打得他的脸嘴都破了。他说：“我回去见着父亲，父亲气病死了，当了房子才买了棺材。后来日本狗腿子逼着要买我的房，那时，我在外边，回家后见门锁着，老婆孩子一家五口不知到那儿去了，十八岁的闺女，十二岁的小子，六岁的闺女，再也见不着了！父亲也死了，真是家破人亡。那时做人真难：日本鬼子打了白打，美国鬼子踢了白踢，不是解放了，苦水一辈子也无处倒。没毛主席领导做梦也想不到有今天。我五十岁了，从没见过中国人这样团结过，眼前盖宿舍、盖大楼、盖子弟小学，给工人办业余学校，帝国主义统治那世界有吗？”接着他高声地说：“美帝今天又打朝鲜打我们了，我们可决不能让他啊！”
    生产技术科晒图员萧凤森早先是个油漆匠，他给前美国大使馆刷油漆时，头上摔了一个大口子。“美国大使”自己弄脏了衣服，还把萧凤森押在黑屋子内关了半天。给日本人刷油漆，被日本人踢下来，摔得半死，不给工钱，父亲都气死了，母亲也死了。来发电厂后，十五岁的小闺女被国民党匪军强奸了，他还被拉去挨打，匪军们说他是“八路”，要杀他。起重工友董立旺说：“哥哥被地主踢死了，告状去，衙门是别人的。日本来“扫荡”，我跑出了。母亲要了十多年饭，结果还是给地主打死了，还追着杀父亲，父亲跑了，家里十多天没揭锅！我活到二十多岁没盖过一床被，尽盖高梁编的席子；榆叶、槐花、柳叶，都吃遍了。今天刚过幸福的日子，美国帝国主义又要让我们当亡国奴，我们要坚决消灭他。”工友们对帝国主义者永不可解的仇恨，已化为一股不可抗拒的力量。努力生产，支援前方，这就是人们对美帝侵略的实际抗议。
