　　Xinhua News Agency, 24th: A comprehensive TASS New York dispatch: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee began discussing the Kuomintang's so-called "Accusation Against the Soviet Union" case on November 21st, which was illegally included in the agenda of this session of the General Assembly by the US and British majority, disregarding the opposition of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. This proposal falsely accuses "the Soviet Union of violating the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance of August 14, 1945, and the United Nations Charter, threatening China's political independence and territorial integrity, and peace in the Far East." Under the manipulation of the United States, this false accusation case was included in the agenda of the Fourth United Nations General Assembly last year, and a resolution was passed at that time to submit the entire issue to the illegal "Little General Assembly" for "research."

　　At the beginning of the meeting, Chiang Ting-fu, the representative of the Kuomintang group, viciously slandered the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. However, he did not present any noteworthy facts in justifying his slanderous accusations. He also put forward a proposal to have the General Assembly appoint a "United Nations Investigation Team" to "obtain" "information and facts" related to the Kuomintang's accusations and report to the "next General Assembly." It is not difficult to see that the purpose of this proposal is to artificially keep the Kuomintang's accusation case on the agenda of the General Assembly.

　　US representative Dulles spoke in support of the Kuomintang elements' proposal. He said that the US delegation believes that this proposal will assist the United Nations in "obtaining facts about the true situation in China." Dulles rudely distorted and fabricated well-known facts, slandered the Soviet Union's foreign policy, and attempted to prove that the Soviet Union had not fulfilled its international obligations.

　　Soviet representative Malik spoke. He emphasized that the Soviet delegation had already exposed the true nature of the Kuomintang's litigious tricks at the Fourth United Nations General Assembly. They tried to confuse the world and make it believe that the Kuomintang regime collapsed due to foreign interference, rather than being overthrown by the Chinese people due to the complete bankruptcy of the regime.

　　Malik said: The Kuomintang's accusation is based on lies and distortions of facts. This applies first and foremost to their provocative attempt to insist that the Soviet Union wants to make the economy of Northeast China subordinate to the Soviet economy. Malik reminded the Political Committee of the agreement reached between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China on February 14, 1950, regarding the transfer to the Chinese People's Government of the Chinese Changchun Railway and all its property, and the equipment of the naval base in the Lushunkou area, etc., and used this to prove that the Kuomintang's attempt was extremely absurd. Malik also elaborated on the Kuomintang's "accusation" that the Soviet Union had supplied weapons to the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Malik cited the confessions of Kuomintang representatives and the materials provided in the well-known US State Department "White Paper" to prove that the Chinese People's Liberation Army used American weapons seized from the Kuomintang group in combat. Malik presented photos of American weapons seized by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in combat with Kuomintang elements as proof.

　　Malik continued: The Kuomintang's "accusation" that the Soviet Union threatened China's political independence and territorial integrity is all inconsistent with reality; the threat to China's political independence and territorial integrity does exist, but this threat does not come from the Soviet Union, but from the US monopoly capitalists. Everyone knows that during the many years of struggle between the Chinese people and the reactionary groups, the US government has always supported, and still supports, the reactionary forces in China, providing them with money and weapons. Malik recounted the facts, saying that according to reliable materials, the United States has provided Chiang Kai-shek with a total of more than 5 billion US dollars in aid. The US armed forces participated directly in the struggle of the Kuomintang army against the people's liberation movement through large-scale airlift and sea transport of Kuomintang troops. The interference of US monopoly capitalists in China's internal affairs is an open threat to China's political independence and territorial integrity. Malik also pointed out that it is the United States that is currently threatening China's territorial integrity and undermining its sovereignty, as can be seen from Truman's order regarding Taiwan, from American planes violating China's airspace, from illegally searching Chinese merchant ships, and so on.

　　Malik then said: The anti-people Kuomintang reactionary regime was defeated because it aroused the anger of the majority of the Chinese people. The Soviet delegation firmly advocated rejecting the Kuomintang's "accusation" case, believing that it had no moral, political, or legal basis whatsoever, and was purely provocative slander.

　　Malik then ridiculed US representative Dulles's statement that the struggle of the people of Asian countries for freedom and independence was carried out on some kind of external instruction. Malik said that the slanderous rumor of so-called exporting revolution to other countries is precisely what the US monopoly capitalists need, and its purpose is only to conceal their aggressive intentions and conceal their conspiracy against the people of Asian and colonial countries.

　　The Syrian representative firmly opposed the establishment of the investigation team proposed by the Kuomintang elements, believing that there were already too many such idle institutions established by the United Nations. He advocated submitting the materials to the International Court of Justice. Representatives from Egypt, Peru, and the United Kingdom also opposed the establishment of this "investigation team."

　　Soviet representative Malik spoke again, emphasizing that the proposal to establish an investigation team, regardless of its organizational composition, was as frivolous and unreasonable as the Kuomintang's "accusation" case itself. He firmly opposed submitting the issue currently under discussion to the International Court of Justice. Malik cited Article 36 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice to prove that the International Court of Justice is not qualified to review the Kuomintang's "accusation" case, because there is no dispute in this case. Malik said that a political group that has gone bankrupt and been driven away by the people is trying to slander a sovereign country. What self-respecting sovereign country would agree to submit such an absurd case to the International Court of Justice? Malik pointed out that there is no question of appealing to the International Court of Justice, and there is no reason to establish an investigation team to study the Kuomintang's unfounded slander.

　　联大政治委员会非法讨论“控苏案”
    马立克斥国民党残匪无耻挑衅
    揭穿蒋廷黻杜勒斯歪曲事实的伎俩
    中苏同盟已粉碎了一切恶毒的谎言
    【新华社二十四日讯】综合塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会政治委员会，于十一月二十一日开始讨论美英多数不顾苏联及人民民主国家反对而非法列入本届大会议程的国民党的所谓“控苏案”。这一提案诬告“苏联违反一九四五年八月十四日中苏友好同盟条约及联合国宪章，威胁中国政治独立与领土完整及远东和平”。在美国操纵下，这诬告案曾在去年联合国第四届大会上列入议程，当时并通过决议，将整个问题提交非法的“小型联大”“研究”。
    在会议开始时，国民党集团代表蒋廷黻恶毒地诽谤苏联与中华人民共和国。但他在辩解其诽谤诬告时，没有提出任何值得注意的事实。他又提出一个提案，要大会任命“联合国调查团”，以“取得”与国民党诬告有关的“情报和事实”，并向“下届大会提出报告”。不难看出，这个提案的目的是要以人为的手段把国民党诬告案在大会上保持下去。
    美国代表杜勒斯发言支持国民党分子的提案。他说：美国代表团认为这个提案将协助联合国“获得关于中国确实情况的事实”。杜勒斯无礼地歪曲和捏造众所周知的事实，诽谤苏联的外交政策，并企图证明苏联并未履行它的国际义务。
    苏联代表马立克发言。他强调指出，苏联代表团在联合国第四届大会上就已经揭穿了国民党的讼棍伎俩的本相。他们力图迷惑世界，使世界相信国民党政权是由于外国的干涉而垮台，而不是由于这一政权完全破产而为中国人民所推翻。
    马立克说：国民党的控诉是以谎言和对于事实的歪曲为根据的。这首先适用于他们挑衅的企图，硬说苏联希望使中国东北的经济从属于苏联的经济。马立克提醒政治委员会注意苏联与中华人民共和国在一九五○年二月十四日达成的关于在中国长春铁路及其一切财产、海军基地旅顺口地区的设备等移交中国人民政府的协议，并以此证明国民党的这种企图是极端荒谬的。马立克又详细论到国民党“控诉”案中硬说苏联曾以武器供给中国人民解放军的说法。马立克引用国民党代表的自白与众所周知的美国国务院“白皮书”中所提供的材料，证明中国人民解放军曾用缴获来的美国运给国民党集团的武器作战。马立克拿出中国人民解放军在与国民党分子作战中所缴获的美国武器的照片作为证明。
    马立克继称：国民党“控诉”案中关于苏联威胁中国政治独立与领土完整的谰言，都是不符合实际情况的；对中国的政治独立与领土完整的威胁是存在的，但这种威胁不是来自苏联，而是来自美国的垄断资本家。大家都知道，在中国人民与反动集团进行斗争的许多年月里，美国政府始终支持，而且现在仍在支持中国的反动势力，供给他们以金钱和武器。马立克追述事实说：根据可靠的材料，美国总共援助蒋介石五十亿美元以上。美国武装部队大规模空运和海运国民党军队，从而直接参加了国民党军队反对人民解放运动的斗争。美国垄断资本家这样干涉中国内政，乃是对中国的政治独立和领土完整的公开威胁。马立克并指出：目前威胁中国领土完整并破坏其主权的正是美国，这从杜鲁门关于台湾的命令，从美国飞机侵犯中国领空，从非法搜查中国的商船等等就可以看得出来。
    马立克接着说：反人民的国民党反动政权遭到了失败，因为它激起了中国大多数人民的愤怒，苏联代表团坚决主张否决国民党的“控诉”案，认为它毫无任何道义上、政治上或法律上的根据，而且纯粹是挑衅诽谤。
    马立克随后讥笑美国代表杜勒斯的一种说法：硬说亚洲各国人民为自由与独立而斗争，乃是奉某种外来的训令而行事。马立克说：所谓输出革命到其他国家的这种诽谤谰言，正是美国垄断资本家所需要的，其目的只是掩饰他们的侵略意图，掩饰他们对亚洲和殖民地国家人民的阴谋。
    叙利亚代表坚决反对建立国民党分子所建议的调查团，认为联合国已经建立的这类无所事事的机构已经太多了。他主张将材料都提交国际法院。埃及、秘鲁和英国代表也反对建立这种“调查团”。
    苏联代表马立克再度发言，强调指出关于设立调查团的建议，不论其组织成分怎样，是和国民党“控诉”案本身一样的无聊与不合理。他坚决反对把目前讨论的问题提交国际法院。马立克引用国际法院规约第三十六条证明：国际法院没有资格审查国民党的“控诉”案，因为在这个案情中没有争端可言。马立克说，某一个破了产而且被人民赶跑了的政治集团，竟试图诽谤一个主权国家。那里有自尊的主权国家会同意把这种荒谬的案件提交国际法院呢？马立克指出：向国际法院上诉是谈不到的，而且没有任何理由设立一个调查团来研究国民党的毫无根据的诽谤。
