Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 16th dispatch (TASS): Five million workers in Italy held a short general strike on the 14th to demand wage increases. Among them, 4.5 million industrial workers began a general strike for four hours from 2:00 PM on the 14th, and 500,000 urban transportation workers began a general strike from midnight on the 14th for 16 to 24 hours.

The General Secretary of the Italian General Confederation of Labour, Vittorio, pointed out: "The most important feature of this strike is that all trade union organizations and all workers are acting in complete concert in the face of the unreasonable and obstinate rigidity of the Confederation of Industrialists." The general strike was jointly launched by the Italian General Confederation of Labour, the Italian Confederation of Labor Unions of Working People (affiliated with the Christian Democratic Party), and the Italian Labor League (affiliated with Saragat's right-wing Socialist Party). During the strike, 100% of the workers in factories in Turin and Milan participated in the strike; in other industrial centers and industrial areas in northern and southern Italy, 95% to 100% of the workers and the vast majority of staff members participated in the strike; in the city of Genoa and the entire province of Genoa, the strike was extended to eight hours. The strike by transportation workers brought all tram and bus traffic to a standstill in Rome, Milan, Turin, Naples, Genoa, and other cities. Workers in various industrial centers held rallies, with thousands of participants.

This general strike of five million people is the result of the stubborn refusal of the Italian National Manufacturers' Association to meet the workers' demands after months of negotiations with the three trade unions. According to the D電通社, this strike is only a preliminary action in the struggle to achieve a reasonable solution. Vittorio stated that this action will be further developed until all demands are met.

　　意大利五百万工人总罢工
    所有工会组织与全体工人协同一致如增加工资不能实现将进一步行动
    【新华社十六日讯】综合塔斯社罗马讯：意大利全国五百万工人为要求增加工资，在十四日举行了短时间的总罢工。其中四百五十万工业工人在十四日下午二时起总罢工四小时，五十万城市交通和运输工人自十四日午夜起总罢工十六小时到二十四小时。
    意大利总工会总书记维多里奥指出：“这次罢工最重要的特点，就是一切工会组织和全体工人在工业家联合会横蛮无理的强硬面前完全协同一致。”总罢工是由意大利总工会，意大利劳动人民工会联合会（属基督教民主党）和意大利劳工联盟（属萨拉盖特的右翼社会党）联合发动的。在罢工中，都灵和米兰各工厂的职工百分之百都参加罢工；意大利北部和南部其他工业中心和工业区中，百分之九十五至百分之百的工人和绝大多数职员都参加罢工；热那亚市和热那亚全省则罢工延长至八小时。交通和运输工人的罢工，使罗马、米兰、都灵、那不勒斯、热那亚及其他城市的电车和公共汽车的交通全部停顿。各工业中心的工人们纷纷举行集会，参加者数以千计。
    这次五百万人的总罢工，乃是意大利全国制造商联合会在与三工会进行了几个月的谈判后顽固地拒绝工人要求的结果。据电通社称：这次罢工不过是争取合理解决斗争中的初步行动。维多里奥表示：在一切要求未能得到满足前，这个行动将会更进一步发展。
