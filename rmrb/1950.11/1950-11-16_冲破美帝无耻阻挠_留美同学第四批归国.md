　　Breaking Through American Imperialism's Shameless Obstruction
　　Fourth Group of Students Returning from the US
　　[This newspaper’s report] According to Shanghai Wenhui Daily, the fourth group of sixteen students returning from the US arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 10th. Jin Xuecheng, Deputy Secretary-General of the East China Military and Political Committee, and Yao Qin, Director of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, and Zhang Suping, Deputy Director, were at the station to welcome them. After the students got off the train, a small discussion was held at the station. Jin Xuecheng and Yao Qin represented the East China Military and Political Committee and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government respectively to welcome these patriotic intellectuals back to the country to participate in construction work. The student representatives responded by saying: "No matter how the American imperialists obstruct and persecute us, we must return to the motherland to serve the people of New China. When we saw the first national flag on the border of the motherland, everyone was so excited that they cheered. The government's warm welcome and reception has strengthened our determination to serve the people. We must unite with compatriots across the country under the leadership of Chairman Mao to fight against American imperialist aggression, defend world peace, and build a new China!" After the meeting, they went to the municipal government's reception office to rest.
　　According to student Liu Guojie, this group consisted of 48 people and 8 family members. They departed from San Francisco on the Wilson on October 12 and arrived in Guangzhou on November 2. In addition to the 16 people who came to Shanghai, the rest were sent to various places from Guangzhou to participate in the construction of the motherland. The tricks of the American imperialists to obstruct our students from returning to New China are becoming more and more serious. In the past, each ship arriving in Hong Kong was allowed to carry 150 Chinese students. Starting from the Wilson on October 12, each ship was only allowed to carry 50 people, and further threats and restrictions were imposed. For the destination of return, only Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian were allowed to be filled in. If Beijing, Northeast, or Shanghai were written, they would not be allowed to leave the country. Many students did not know about this new restriction in advance and filled it in truthfully, and they were not approved. Before leaving the country, everyone had to be questioned by the American Imperialist Political Department, asking mindless questions such as "Do you like Chiang Kai-shek or Mao Zedong?" "If World War III breaks out, will you stand on the side of the United States or the Soviet Union?" When Liu Guojie described these situations, he said angrily: "American politics is entirely controlled by this group of mindless people. People who like Chiang Kai-shek, would they still come back? My answer to them was a roar. I said that under the Chiang Kai-shek government, I worked as a small clerk for thirteen years. Haven't I seen enough of his corruption and darkness? Who would abandon the light and pursue the darkness?"
　　The fourth group of students returning from the US who arrived in Shanghai are: Zhang Cunhao (Chemical Engineering), Chen Jianyuan (Chemical Engineering), Chen Dehua (Economics), Zhou Xigeng (Medicine), Diao Kaizhi (Economic Management), Xu Renji (Female, Child Welfare), Gu Maoxiang (Shipbuilding), Li Depei (Economics), Liu Guojie (Pharmaceuticals), Luo Shiyu (Economics), Wang Jitao (Pharmaceutical Chemistry), Wang Rongguang (Medicine), Cheng Jiahui (Female, Music), Wei Xiuzheng (Female, Literature), Wu Jihui (Foreign Languages), Gu Ruiqing (International Law).

　　冲破美帝无耻阻挠
    留美同学第四批归国
    【本报讯】据上海文汇报消息：第四批留美归国学生十六人十日晨抵沪，华东军政委员会金学成副秘书长、上海市人民政府姚溱处长、张苏平副处长均到车站欢迎。同学们下车后，即在车站举行小型座谈会，由金学成、姚溱分别代表华东军政委员会和上海市人民欢迎这些爱国知识分子回国参加建设工作。同学代表致答词说：“不管美帝如何阻挠迫害，我们一定要回到祖国来，为新中国的人民服务。当我们看到祖国边疆上第一面国旗时，大家兴奋得狂呼起来。政府这样热烈的欢迎和招待我们，更加强我们为人民服务的决心，我们一定要和全国同胞一起在毛主席的领导下，为反对美帝侵略，保卫世界和平，和建设新中国而奋斗！”会后即赴市府招待处休息下榻。
    据刘国杰同学说，本批共四十八人，眷属八人，于十月十二日趁威尔逊号轮船，由旧金山启程，十一月二日到达广州；除来沪的十六人外，余均由广州分赴各地参加祖国的建设工作。美帝阻挠我学生回返新中国的花样越来越厉害，过去每艘到香港来的轮船，准载中国学生一百五十人，由十月十二日的威尔逊号起，每艘只准载五十人，而且更进一步威胁和限制。对于回国的目的地，只许填广东、广西、福建，如果写了北京、东北、上海，即不准许离境。这次有许多同学事前不知道这项新限制，照实填写了，都未能获准。在离境前，每个人都要经过美帝政治部的查询，问些毫无脑筋的问题，例如“你喜欢蒋介石还是毛泽东？”“如果三次大战爆发，你站在美国的一边，还是苏联的一边？”当刘国杰同学叙述这些情况时，愤恨地说：“美国的政治全是操在这班没有脑筋的东西的手里，喜欢蒋介石的人，还会回来吗？我给他们的回答是怒吼，我说我在蒋介石政府下，做了十三年小公务员，难道还没有瞧够他的腐败和黑暗，那有舍弃光明而追求黑暗的人。”
    第四批留美归国学生抵沪者是：张存浩（化工）、陈鉴远（化工）、陈德华（经济）、周锡庚（医）、刁开智（经济工管）、徐仁吉（女、儿童福利）、顾懋祥（造船）、李德沛（经济）、刘国杰（制药）、罗世钰（经济）、王积涛（药物化学）、王荣光（医）、成嘉祜（女、音乐）、魏修征（女、文学）、吴继辉（外文）、顾瑞清（国际法）。
