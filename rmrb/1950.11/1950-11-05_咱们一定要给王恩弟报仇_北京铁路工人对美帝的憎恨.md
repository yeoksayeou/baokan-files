　　We Must Avenge Wang Endi
    ——Hatred of American Imperialism by Beijing Railway Workers
    Our reporter Chen Ji
    In a discussion meeting, Yao Shanji, a porter at the Beijing Railway Station, was looking through an old, yellowed newspaper and a dossier placed on the table. Yao Shanji found a photograph in the dossier and looked sadly at the tragic scene: a young worker wearing a yellow vest and white short jacket lay miserably beside the train tracks. His head was separated from his body. Holding the photograph, Yao Shanji said excitedly, "This is the unforgettable evidence of the crime of American imperialism's massacre of our workers." On September 3, 1946, Wang Endi, a young shunter in his twenties, was shunting at the West Station when a bullet suddenly entered his head, and his brains splattered on the train. Wang Endi fell diagonally under the train and had his head severed by the wheels. The killer of Wang Endi was an American soldier. This American soldier stood on a gasoline barrel at the entrance of the West Station, comparing skills with two other American soldiers. He used Wang Endi's head as a target to demonstrate his marksmanship. The American soldier shot Wang Endi, and the other two American soldiers laughed loudly. This historical hatred, concealed for three years by the Kuomintang reactionaries, is forever deeply imprinted in the hearts of every railway worker. They said angrily, "Our brother Wang Endi was killed for no reason. We must avenge Wang Endi!" At the meeting on resisting America and aiding Korea at the Beijing Railway Station, the workers once again recalled their inhuman lives under the rule of imperialism and its running dogs. Wang Minghai, who had been injured by an American's rifle butt, said, "What kind of lives did we live when the American devils were here? We ate cornbread and drank plain water every day, and we still had to suffer the abuse of the Americans and the Kuomintang reactionaries." One night after Wang Endi's death, Wang Minghai was carrying goods at the West Station when two American soldiers chased after a woman boarding the train. The woman was so frightened that she screamed and ran, got on the train, and closed the door tightly. The American soldiers kicked the door for a long time, but to no avail. Suddenly, they saw Wang Minghai and asked, "Are there any girls?" Wang Minghai said, "No!" The American soldiers were annoyed. They grabbed Wang Minghai and beat him with rifle butts for a long time. Wang Minghai lay unconscious on the ground and was carried to the hospital by the workers. Every worker who participated in the meeting had been beaten by American soldiers. They told me, "At that time, the family members of the West Station employees did not dare to come. Even the children were afraid of the West Station." One day, the child of the old worker Mi Dexing came to see his father and met an American soldier on the way. For no reason, the child's face was swollen by the American soldier. Mi Dexing immediately became excited when he mentioned this. "Damn it, the American killed Wang Endi and suffered no punishment; he injured my child, let alone. At that time, the Kuomintang's laws were only useful to us, not to them."
    Mi Dexing had personally witnessed the American soldier kill Wang Endi and had testified as a witness against the murderer—the American soldier. He said that Wang Endi died, but the Kuomintang Railway Bureau did not care. The "court" examined the body but did not accept the case. The workers were extremely angry. They went to the U.S. military headquarters themselves, went more than a dozen times, but couldn't even find someone in charge, let alone file a complaint. He showed everyone a stack of files on the table, which contained many documents requesting compensation from the Americans. He said, "The American killed our workers, and our workers had nowhere to accuse them. This is the logic of American imperialism." Mi Dexing pushed the files hard to the west. The title of the newspaper on the east side of the table immediately appeared in front of the workers: "The Dead Are Gone, How Can the Living Bear It? Wang Endi's Life Was Only Worth Six Hundred U.S. Dollars." Everyone looked at the newspaper and remembered the oppression of the past. A flame of anger burned in everyone's heart.
    Now, the American beasts who killed Wang Endi are advancing towards our border. The porter Yao Shanji said, "Can we sit idly by?" "Absolutely not! We'll beat them to death!" Mi Dexing raised his fist, which had been working for more than forty years, and slammed it firmly on the table, saying, "Imperialism is a wolf. If we don't kill it, it will bite us to death!"
    The Beijing Railway Station now belongs to the Chinese people, and the people who work here have obtained a happy and free life. Yao Shanji, a porter who had always been discriminated against, was poorly clothed and could not even afford cornbread in the past, and was often beaten by imperialists. Today, he wears a new dark black cotton uniform and works happily. Every two or three days, he can also buy a pound of pork, take it home, and drink a few cups of old wine with his wife; sometimes, he also makes red clothes for his two sons, who were once called "stinky brats." After more than a year of study after liberation, he understood the meaning of slogan words and also understood national affairs. He said, "Today's life is too good!" He looked forward to tomorrow's life and was almost excited to jump up. But, he said, "If we don't defeat American imperialist aggression, we can forget about keeping our good life!" He expressed his intention to do three things well at the meeting: (1) Strictly guard against special agents; (2) Exceed the completion of the winter transport task; (3) Deeply promote resisting America and aiding Korea and defending our homes and country to the passengers.
    The upsurge of resisting America and aiding Korea and defending our homes and country has been surging in Beijing Railway Station. Next to the platform of the Beijing Railway Station, I saw a guide holding a loudspeaker, carefully looking at a small book pasted with clippings, reading articles about resisting America and aiding Korea. I walked past a spacious dormitory and heard train attendants resting in bed reading the quick board about resisting America and aiding Korea: "If we don't extinguish the flames of American imperialist aggression, our hard days will come again. . . ." They take advantage of their rest time to practice these quick boards, preparing to promote them to passengers on the train. The passenger director said, "We have a responsibility to let passengers know the ambition of American imperialism and mobilize the people of the whole country to resist American imperialist aggression." They are constantly watching the war of American imperialist aggression in Korea and deeply know that the affairs of the Korean people are closely related to them. I participated in their discussion meetings several times and heard very excited voices from them continuously: "We must help the Korean people!" (Attached picture)

　　咱们一定要给王恩弟报仇
    ——北京铁路工人对美帝的憎恨
    本报记者陈迹
    在一个座谈会里，北京车站搬运工姚善继翻看着放在桌上的一张报纸和一个卷宗，报纸和卷宗都旧得发黄了，姚善继从卷宗里找出了一张照片，悲痛地看着照片上的惨象：一个身穿黄背心白小褂的年青工人，凄惨地卧在火车轨道旁边。他的头和身体已经分开了。姚善继拿着照片，激动地说：“这是美帝国主义惨杀咱们工人的永远忘不了的罪证。”一九四六年九月三日，二十来岁的调车夫王恩弟在西站调车，一颗子弹突然射进他的头颅，脑浆迸溅到火车头上。王恩弟斜倒在车底下，又被车轮轧断了头。杀死王恩弟的是一个美国兵。这个美国兵站在西站门口的汽油桶上，和另外两个美国兵比本领。他以王恩弟的头作为枪靶子，表演自己的枪法。这个美国兵射中了王恩弟，另外两个美国兵在一旁哈哈大笑。这个被国民党反动派隐瞒了三年的历史仇恨，永远深印在每个铁路工人的心中。他们愤怒地说道：“咱们的弟兄王恩弟就这样无缘无故被打死了，咱们一定要给王恩弟报仇！”北京车站的工人在抗美援朝的座谈会里，再一次回想起他们在帝国主义和帝国主义走狗统治下的非人生活。曾被美国人用枪柄打伤过的王明海说：“美国鬼子在这儿的时候，咱们过的是什么日子？天天吃窝窝头和白开水，还要受美国人和国民党反动派的气。”在王恩弟死后的一个晚上，王明海正在西站搬运货物，两个美国兵追赶着一个乘火车的妇女，妇女吓得乱嚷乱跑，跑到车上，闭紧车门。美国兵用脚踢车门，踢了半天，没有结果。忽然，他们看见王明海，就问：“有姑娘没有？”王明海说：“没有！”美国兵恼了，他们抓住王明海用枪柄打了半天。王明海昏昏迷迷地躺在地上，被工人们抬到医院里。参加座谈会的每个工人都挨过美国兵的毒打，他们告诉我：“那时候，西站的员工家眷都不敢来。连孩子们都害怕西站。”老工友米德兴的孩子，有一天来看爸爸，走到半路，遇到一个美国兵。没有任何原因，孩子的脸被美国兵打肿了。米德兴说起这件事，立刻激动起来。“他妈的，美国人打死王恩弟，没受制裁；打伤我的孩子，更不用说了。那时候，国民党的法律只对咱们有用，对他们没用处。”
    米德兴曾经亲眼看见美国兵打死王恩弟，曾经以证人身份控告过杀人凶犯—美国兵。他说，王恩弟死了，国民党的铁路局不过问，“法院”验了尸首，也不再受理。工友们气愤极了，自己去找美军司令部，找了十几趟，连个负责人都没找到，更不用说什么控告了。他把放在桌上的一叠卷宗翻给大家看，卷宗里放着很多要求美国人赔偿损失的文件。他说：“美国人打死了咱工人，咱工人没处控告他们，这就是美帝国主义的道理。”米德兴狠狠地把卷宗向西边一推，放在东边桌上的报纸的标题立刻出现在工人们的眼前，标题是：“死者已矣，生者何堪，王恩弟一条命，才值六百美金。”大家看着报纸，想起当年被压迫的情景，每个人的心里都烧起愤怒的火焰。
    现在，杀死王恩弟的美国野兽正向我国边疆前进。搬运工姚善继说：“咱们能够坐视吗？”“绝对不能！咱们揍死它！”米德兴举起劳动了四十多年的拳头，斩钉截铁地敲着桌子，说道：“帝国主义是狼，咱不打死它，它就要咬死咱！”
    北京车站已归中国人民所有，在这里工作的人已经获得幸福、自由的生活。姚善继，这个一向受人歧视的搬运工人，在过去衣不蔽体，连窝窝头都吃不上，还常被帝国主义者毒打。今天，他穿上了新的深黑色的棉制服，快快活活地工作着。每隔两三天，他还能买斤把猪肉，带回家去，和老婆喝几杯老酒；有时候，还给两个曾被人家叫做“臭崽子”的儿子，做套红衣服。经过解放后一年多的学习，他认识了标语词儿的意思，也懂得了国家大事，他说：“今天的生活是太好了！”他向往着明天的生活，几乎激动得跳了起来。但是，他说：“不打败美帝侵略，咱们的好生活就休想保！”他在座谈会里表示要做好三件工作：（一）严防特务；（二）超过完成冬季运输任务；（三）深入地向旅客们宣传抗美援朝，保家卫国。
    抗美援朝保家卫国的热潮，已经在北京车站汹涌澎湃起来。在北京车站的月台旁边，我看见一位手拿喇叭的向导员，很专心地看着贴有剪报的小本子，念着抗美援朝的文章。我走过一间宽敞的宿舍，听见在床上休息的列车员正读着抗美援朝的快板：“不扑灭美帝侵略火焰，咱们的苦日子又要来临。……”他们乘着休息时间，练习这些快板，准备在列车上向旅客们宣传。客运主任说：“咱们有责任让旅客们知道美帝国主义的野心，动员全国人民都起来抵抗美帝侵略。”他们时时刻刻注视着美帝侵略朝鲜的战争，深深知道朝鲜人民的事情和他们有着密切的关联。我几次参加他们的座谈会，几次都听见从他们那里连续地传出很激动的声音：“咱们要帮助朝鲜人民！”（附图片）
