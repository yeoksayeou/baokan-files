　　The Victory in Northern Vietnam
    ——Notes from Vietnamese Comrades on the Dong Khe, Cao Bang, and That Khe Campaigns
    By Our Correspondent Liang Tian
    The Vietnamese People's Army and local forces, with the active support of the people, conducted a well-prepared and planned mobile warfare and annihilation campaign in Dong Khe, Cao Bang, and That Khe in northern Vietnam, achieving a great victory. This victory continues to influence the overall situation in Vietnam today.
    The factors contributing to the victory of the Dong Khe, Cao Bang, and That Khe campaigns were the thorough deployment by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army, the valiant combat of the Vietnamese People's Army, and the enthusiastic support of the Vietnamese people.
    In the spring of this year, France continuously dispatched reinforcements to northern Vietnam, strengthening its defense capabilities there. Because the basic intention of the American and French imperialists in Vietnam was to cut off the Democratic Republic of Vietnam from contact with the democratic world and to seize the rice-producing areas and coal mines of the Red River Delta. Cao Bang was an important barrier in northern Vietnam, with a defensive system based on Lang Son, Hai Phong, Hanoi, and Mong Cai. To defend Cao Bang, the French army built solid, hidden fortresses all around the mountains, and within Cao Bang city, the French army also built many bunkers. Fearing attacks by the People's Army, the French army also created a no-man's land around the defense area, and the roads outside the city were gradually covered with weeds and trees. Cao Bang became a true isolated island, relying entirely on air transport for supplies. When the People's Army advanced into Cao Bang, they had to clear grass and trees while advancing on many highways.
    At the beginning of this year, the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army began preparing to liberate the northern border and break the enemy's blockade. The battle of Po Lu in February of this year and the first liberation of Dong Khe in May of this year were both to test the enemy's strength, and the results proved that the enemy's strength was weakening. Since the elite of the French army was concentrated in the north, the People's Army had to be fully prepared to achieve the two goals of liberating the northern border and annihilating the enemy's effective forces. From the beginning of this year until the launch of the Dong Khe campaign in mid-September, the People's Army had been actively preparing for the offensive.
    During the preparation period, the people of northern Vietnam devoted themselves to supporting the front with the greatest enthusiasm. For the Dong Khe, Cao Bang, and That Khe campaigns alone, 180,000 people participated in road construction and transportation. Especially in the road construction work to facilitate transportation, a large amount of labor was needed. Initially, the French army had the advantage of offensive, while the People's Army was still in the defensive stage, and all the highways were broken. To advance, these roads had to be repaired. The Viet Bac Interzone is vast and sparsely populated. In this campaign, not only the people near the war zone were mobilized, but also the people from Thai Nguyen, Bac Kan and other provinces, which were one or two hundred kilometers away, came to participate. Before the campaign, mobilization meetings were held in every village, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. Most of the road construction work was undertaken by women. Their husbands joined the army, and they were busy with household affairs, but they still came to build roads. They said that household chores could be delayed, and that rationalizing household chores could still free up time. Everyone who supported the front was convinced that their labor would be exchanged for victory.
    Road construction and transportation, as well as other preparations for the counter-offensive, were not only carried out near Cao Bang and Lang Son, but also near Lao Cai. Wherever there were French strongholds, preparations for the counter-offensive were underway. The French army was terrified. They did not know where the People's Army's spearhead would be pointing tomorrow, and they could only prepare in a panic.
    On September 16, the Viet Bac campaign began in Dong Khe. Dong Khe is an important stronghold on the Cao Bang-Lang Son highway, which was once liberated in May of this year. It is 45 kilometers north of Cao Bang and 25 kilometers south of That Khe. The General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army chose this stronghold with a purpose. If the French army lost Dong Khe, Cao Bang would certainly not be defended. The Dong Khe campaign began on September 16 and ended on the 18th. The Vietnamese People's Army, which had been recharging its batteries for a long time, fought bravely, and the French army in the stronghold was completely annihilated. French commander Alioux was captured. Regarding this victory, "Voice of Vietnam" pointed out: "As we are completing preparations for the general counter-offensive to gradually eliminate the enemy's strength, this is the first victory, which will play a leading role on the Indochina battlefield." The Dong Khe campaign did play a leading role in the victory in northern Vietnam. After the liberation of Dong Khe, as expected, the French army in Cao Bang, led by Lieutenant Colonel Charton, attempted to retreat to Lang Son, and the French army in That Khe, led by Colonel Le Basi, went north to meet them. The original plan was for these two units to meet in Dong Khe two days later, and then retreat to Lang Son together. The French army, departing from That Khe, only prepared two days' worth of rations before setting off. However, the road for the invading army was destroyed, bullets flew from all directions, and, along the way, they could not see a single civilian and could not find anything to eat. After the two days' rations were finished, they had no choice but to slaughter military dogs to satisfy their hunger. Under the firepower of the Vietnamese People's Army, the French army was forced to flee into the mountains batch by batch. When these two units were about to complete their arduous journey, and were only one kilometer apart, the People's Army surrounded the enemy. After the soldiers' brave charges and hand-to-hand combat, the People's Army finally completely wiped out the enemy.
    Among the 6,000 French colonial troops annihilated and captured, there were 2,000 French and European troops, more than 3,000 Moroccan soldiers, and only 800 Bao Dai puppet troops. This shows that most of the French army's elite forces on the northern border of Vietnam have been lost. The People's Army not only obtained a large number of enemy weapons to equip themselves, but also gained valuable experience in launching large-scale mobile warfare.
    French commander Alioux, who was captured in Dong Khe, and French officers Le Basi and Charton, who were captured later, unanimously admitted in interviews with reporters that the Vietnamese People's Army had high morale and that the people cooperated well with the troops. That is why they could not find anything to eat when they were extremely hungry.
    The Vietnamese people treat prisoners of war with leniency. They hate the French colonialists, and they fought bravely against the colonialists' armed forces, but they give appropriate treatment and care to French soldiers who have laid down their weapons. More than 2,000 French prisoners of war in the Cao Bang, Dong Khe, and That Khe campaigns were treated by people from all over Vietnam, and many villages even put on educational dramas for them. After the campaign, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam notified the French military and the Red Cross, allowing them to send planes to transport the wounded prisoners of war back to Hanoi for recuperation. When the wounded prisoners of war were being transported, the local people cheered and waved goodbye as they boarded the Red Cross plane. Many French prisoners of war were moved to tears, and their understanding of the Vietnamese people was completely different from before. The French government later spread rumors that the Vietnamese People's Army's anti-aircraft guns bombarded their planes carrying wounded prisoners of war as an excuse to refuse to transport them. In fact, the reactionary French government was simply afraid that the Vietnamese people's goodwill would be conveyed to the French soldiers.
    After the Cao Bang, Dong Khe, and That Khe campaigns, the people of northern Vietnam saw the results of their support and their strength. They were excited and happy, and celebration meetings and meetings to comfort the People's Army were held everywhere. They also participated in cleaning up the battlefield, caring for the wounded, and escorting prisoners of war. The People's Army and local armed forces in central and southern Vietnam responded to the great victory in northern Vietnam by intensifying harassment battles against French strongholds in various places.
    The government and newspapers of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have stated that the Vietnamese People's Army has achieved a great victory in the northern border campaign, but this victory is only an important step in the overall war plan to launch a general counter-offensive and completely expel the French invaders. In a recent letter to the people of northern Vietnam celebrating the victory, President Ho Chi Minh repeatedly instructed the Vietnamese people: "We should not be complacent about our victory or underestimate our enemies. We should keep firmly in mind that the recent victory is only the first step in our nationwide, long-term struggle towards complete victory." In the Cao Bang, Dong Khe, and That Khe campaigns, according to the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army, one hundred soldiers were sacrificed, and 65 percent of the five hundred wounded commanders and fighters were lightly wounded. Although the People's Army won a great victory with a casualty ratio of one to sixty, the Vietnamese people still believe that this campaign needs to be carefully reviewed and summarized. They want to draw more lessons from this campaign to ensure greater victories in the future.

　　越北的胜利
    ——记越南来人谈东溪、高平、七溪战役
    本报记者　梁田
    越南人民军和地方部队，在人民的积极支援下，在越南北部的东溪、高平和七溪打了一次有准备有计划的运动战和歼灭战，获得了很大的胜利。这一胜利到今天仍在影响着越南的全局。
    造成东溪、高平和七溪战役的胜利的因素是越南民主共和国政府和越南人民军总司令部的周密部署越南人民军的勇猛作战和越南人民的热烈支前。
    今年春天，法国不断地抽调援兵开往越北，增强它在越北的防守力。因为美法帝国主义者在越南的基本企图，就在截断越南民主共和国与民主世界的联系，并据有红河三角洲的产米区与煤矿区。高平正是以谅山、海防、河内、芒街为防御体系的越南北部的重要屏障。为了固守高平，法军在四周山地遍筑坚固的隐蔽的堡垒，在高平城内，法军也建有很多的碉堡。法军害怕人民军的攻击，又在防地的周围造成无人地带，城外的道路逐渐为荒草野树盖满了。高平这才变成了真正的孤岛，一切给养全靠空运，人民军进军高平时，在许多公路上，不得不一面除草拔树，一面前进。
    今年年初，越南人民军总司令部即着手准备解放北部边境，打断敌人的封锁。今年二月坡鲁之战、今年五月第一次解放东溪之战，这两次战役都为的是试探敌人的力量，结果证明敌人的力量是在削弱。由于法军的精锐集中在北部，人民军必须有充分的准备，才能达到解放北部边境，歼灭法军有生力量这两个目的。自今年初迄九月中旬发动东溪战役时为止，人民军一直积极准备着进攻。
    在准备期间，越北人民以最大的热情献给支前工作。单是东溪、高平和七溪战役，便有民众十八万人工参加修筑公路和运输。特别是在便利运输的修路工作上，需要着很多的人工。起初法军占有进攻的优势，而人民军尚在防御阶段，所有的公路都寸断了。要进军，必须修补这些道路。越北联区，地广人稀。在这次战役中，不仅战区附近人民都动员了，远离一、二百公里的太原、北?等省人民也都来参加。在战役之前一?各个村庄都开了动员大会，情绪非常热烈。修筑公路工作，多数是妇女承担的。她们的丈夫参军了，家里事务又忙，但是她们依然来修路。她们说，家务是可以缓办的，而且使家务合理化还是可以腾出时间来。支前的民众每个人都确信，他们的劳力将换来胜利。
    修路和运输以及其他准备反攻的工作不止在高平谅山附近进行着，也在老开等地附近进行着，凡是有法军据点的地方，都在准备着反攻工作。于是法军惶恐不安了。他们不知道人民军的矛头究竟明天要指向那里，他们也只有慌乱地准备着。
    九月十六日，越北战役在东溪开始了。东溪是高平谅山公路上的一个重要据点，今年五月曾一度解放。北距高平四十五公里，南距七溪二十五公里。越南人民军总司令部选择了这一个据点，是有它的用意的。法军如果失掉东溪，高平一定不守。东溪战役于九月十六日开始，十八日结束。养精蓄锐已久的越南人民军勇敢作战，据点里的法军完全被歼。法军指挥官阿留克斯被俘。关于这次的胜利。“越南之声”曾指出：“当我们正在完成总反攻准备以逐渐消灭敌人力量之时，这是第一次胜利，在印度支那战场上将起带头作用。”东溪战役的确起了越北胜利的带头作用。东溪解放后，果然，高平的法军由夏尔同中校率领，企图退向谅山，七溪的法军由赖巴西上校率领北上接应。原定计划是这两支部队两日后在东溪会师，然后一同退往谅山。由七溪出发的法军只备了两天口粮就出发了。但是，侵略军前进的道路破坏了，子弹从四面飞来，而且，他们一路上看不见一个老百姓，找不到一点东西吃，两天的口粮吃完后，只有宰杀军犬充饥，在越南人民军的火力扫射下，法军被迫一批一批的向山林中乱窜。当这两支部队快要完成他们的艰苦的行程，两下里只隔一公里时，人民军却把敌人包围起来。经过了战士们勇猛的冲杀与肉搏，人民军终于把敌人完全消灭了。
    被歼灭及俘获的六千名法国殖民军中，计有法军和欧洲军二千人，摩洛哥士兵三千余人，保大伪军仅八百人。这说明在越北边境的法军精锐大部分已丧失了。人民军不仅获得了敌人的大批武器可以装备自己，而且获得了展开大规模运动战的宝贵经验。
    在东溪被俘的法军指挥官阿留克斯，和后来被俘的赖巴西、夏尔同等法方军官在记者访问时，一致承认越南人民军士气高，人民与部队合作得好。这才使他们到饥饿万分时一点吃的东西都找不到。
    越南人民对俘虏是优待的。他们仇恨法国殖民者，他们对殖民者的武装部队作战是奋勇的，但对已经放下武器的法国士兵却给以适当的待遇与照应。高平、东溪与七溪战役中法军俘虏二千余人，均受到越南各地人民的招待，很多村子且演出一些富有教育意义的戏剧给他们看。越南民主共和国政府曾于战役过后，通知法国军方及红十字会，允许他们派飞机来接运受伤俘虏回河内疗养。当受伤俘虏起运时，当地民众曾欢送他们坐红十字会飞机起飞。许多法军俘虏感动得流下眼泪，他们对越南人民的认识，已经与从前完全不同了。法国政府后来造谣说，越南人民军的高射炮曾轰击他们接运受伤俘虏的飞机，作为拒绝接运的借口。实际上是法国的反动政府无非害怕越南人民的善意传达给法国士兵罢了。
    高平、东溪与七溪战役之后，越南北部的人民看见了自己的支援的成果，看见了自己的力量，他们兴奋、愉快，各地都开了祝捷大会，慰劳人民军大会。他们还参加清理战场工作，照顾伤兵，押送俘虏。越南中部、南部的人民军和地方武装则以加紧出击法军各处据点的牵制性战斗，来响应越北的巨大胜利。
    越南民主共和国的政府和报纸，均表示：越南人民军在北部边境的战役已获得巨大的胜利，但是，这一胜利只是走向总反攻、完全驱逐法国侵略者的全部战役计划中一个重要的步骤而已。胡志明主席最近在致函越北人民庆祝胜利时，一再指示越南人民：“我们不应该对我们的胜利抱有自满或低估我们的敌人。我们应该牢牢记住，最近的胜利，只不过是我们全国范围的长期斗争走向完全胜利的第一步。”在高平、东溪和七溪战役中，据越南人民军总司令部公布，牺牲战士一百人，受伤的五百名指战员中百分之六十五为轻伤。人民军固然以一比六十的伤亡比例，赢得了很大胜利，但越南人民还是认为这一战役需要仔细检讨，总结经验。他们要从这一战役中汲取更多的教训来保证将来更大的胜利。
