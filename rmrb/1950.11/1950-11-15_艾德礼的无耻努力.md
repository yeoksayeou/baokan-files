　　Attlee's Shameless Efforts
　　*Pravda* Correspondent Zhukov
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 14th] TASS, Moscow: The *Pravda* of the 12th carried a dispatch from its Paris correspondent, Zhukov, entitled "Attlee's Shameless Efforts," which stated: As the opening date of the Second World Peace Congress approaches, the British ruling clique becomes increasingly panicked. Attlee launched a propaganda offensive, insisting that the Peace Congress was a Communist gathering, but the publication of the list of delegates proved him a liar. The delegates attending the Congress actually included people of various political and religious beliefs, including members of Attlee's own Labour Party. Attlee also said the Congress was not representative, but the lineup of delegates exposed his lies again. The 1,720 delegates from 72 countries sent to Sheffield not only represented the 500 million people who signed the peace declaration and the countless peace advocates who accepted the call of the Prague meeting of the World Peace Council, but also these delegates were elected in the most democratic manner.
　　Zhukov continued: As the preparations for the Peace Congress unfolded widely, the aggressors in Washington became increasingly annoyed. They forbade key American delegates, such as the writer Howard Fast, from attending the Congress, and ordered their satellite countries to follow suit. Attlee therefore took on the role of police chief in obstructing the holding of the Congress. But the "achievement" that Attlee and his masters obtained in exchange for the sweeping away of political and moral credibility was merely a postponement of the Congress by three days, while the powerful and unparalleled mass movement of peace fighters will continue to develop and grow stronger.

　　艾德礼的无耻努力
    真理报记者　朱可夫
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：十二日的真理报刊载了该报驻巴黎记者朱可夫所撰题为《艾德礼的无耻努力》的通讯称：第二届世界保卫和平大会开幕的日期愈逼近、英国统治集团就愈感恐慌。艾德礼发动了一个宣传攻势，硬说和平大会是共产党人的大会，但和大代表团名单的公布，证明了他自己是个撒谎家。出席大会的代表实际包括了各种不同政治与宗教信仰的人，其中甚至包括了艾德礼本人所参加的工党的党员。艾德礼又说大会没有代表性，但代表的阵容，又揭穿了他的谎言，七十二国人民派赴设菲尔德的一千七百二十名代表，不但代表了在和平宣言上签名的五亿人民和接受和大执行局布拉格会议号召的无数和平拥护者，而且这些代表们都是经由最民主的方式推选出来的。
    朱可夫继称：随着和平大会筹备工作的广泛展开，华盛顿的侵略者们愈益恼怒。他们禁止美国的主要代表如作家法斯特等参加大会，并命令仆从国家要跟他们学步。艾德礼因此就担负了阻挠大会举行的警察长的任务。但是艾德礼及其主子们用政治与道德信誉的扫地所换来的“成就”，不过是大会的延期三天举行，而和平斗士的强大无比的群众性运动，将不断发展壮大起来。
