　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 17th, TASS dispatch: At the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee meeting on the afternoon of November 15th, the original plan was to debate the so-called "Formosa Question," which was included on the agenda at the insistence of the U.S. delegation, despite the firm opposition of the Soviet Union and some other national delegations. However, U.S. representative Dulles suggested postponing the discussion of this motion and moving it to the last item on the Political Committee's agenda. At the same time, Dulles admitted that the U.S. delegation, in raising this issue, had originally expected a swift end to the Korean War. But now, according to him, the situation has fundamentally changed.

　　The Kuomintang clique representative said that he did not object to reviewing the Formosa issue in the later stages of the Political Committee's work.

　　Soviet representative Malik made a statement on this issue. In the statement, he recounted that in the General Committee meeting and the General Assembly plenary session, the Soviet delegation had strived to oppose the inclusion of the Formosa (Taiwan) issue on the agenda. Malik pointed out that the issue of the sovereignty of Taiwan Island has been resolved by wartime agreements and cannot be changed. He urged the representatives of the Political Committee to pay attention to the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration, as well as the terms of Japan's surrender. According to the first two agreements, Taiwan Island has been returned to China as an inalienable part of China, and the terms of Japan's surrender further affirmed the aforementioned international agreements. Malik also emphasized that the United Nations is generally not qualified to review this issue because it has been resolved by wartime agreements between the Allies. In light of this, the Taiwan issue should be removed from the General Assembly's agenda.

　　Malik said: Imagine if a certain delegation wanted to include the discussion of the Hawaiian Islands issue or the status of the islands on the General Assembly agenda, then, without a doubt, the U.S. government would say that this issue should not be discussed in the General Assembly. It is equally absurd to discuss the Taiwan issue!

　　Malik said: The task of the United Nations is to review the U.S. aggression against the People's Republic of China—an aggression that threatens peace and security in the Far East. He insisted that the Political Committee immediately begin discussing the next issue on the agenda, which was included at the insistence of the Soviet delegation: the "Soviet Union's Accusation of U.S. Aggression Against China" case.

　　The Political Committee then began discussing some procedural issues. These issues took up the rest of the afternoon session. The Kuomintang clique representative made a suggestion to have the Political Committee begin reviewing the Kuomintang's false accusation against the Soviet Union case.

　　The Brazilian representative suggested that the Political Committee adjourn until November 20th because the General Assembly would hold a plenary session on November 16th.

　　Malik opposed the Political Committee interrupting its work without any reason. He urged the Political Committee to discuss the next item on the agenda, namely: the U.S. Aggression Against China case. At the same time, Malik proposed a motion regarding inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the Political Committee's meeting to discuss this issue. The Soviet delegation's motion was as follows:

　　"The Political Committee, considering that the Fifth Session of the General Assembly is discussing the 'Soviet Union's Accusation of U.S. Aggression Against China' issue, and considering that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has stated that representatives of the People's Republic of China should participate in the discussion of the aforementioned issue, hereby resolves: to invite representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to participate in the Political Committee meeting regarding the discussion of the 'Soviet Union's Accusation of U.S. Aggression Against China' issue."

　　After concluding the discussion of procedural issues, the Political Committee began voting. The U.S. proposal to place the Formosa issue last on the agenda was first passed with 53 votes in favor and 5 abstentions (Afghanistan, Yugoslavia, Yemen, Syria, Burma). The Kuomintang elements' proposal was then put to a vote, resulting in 14 votes in favor, 8 votes against (including the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Burma, Lebanon), and 36 abstentions. Thus, this proposal was passed by a negligible majority. The Chairman of the Political Committee postponed the Soviet delegation's proposal regarding inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the Political Committee meeting for discussion and voting at the next meeting.

　　Subsequently, the Brazilian representative proposed that the Political Committee adjourn until November 20th. This proposal was passed by a majority vote: 36 votes in favor, 2 votes against, and 20 abstentions.

　　敦促联大政委会讨论美国侵略中国案
    苏联建议邀我国代表参加
    指出开罗协定与波茨坦协定已肯定台湾为中国领土，“福摩萨问题”应从大会议程上撤销。
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社纽约十七日讯：联合国大会政治委员会十一月十五日下午的会议，原定辩论在美国代表团坚持下不顾苏联及其他一些国家代表团的坚决反对而列入议程的所谓“福摩萨问题”。但美国代表杜勒斯建议延期讨论这一议案，并把它移至政治委员会议程的最后一项。同时，杜勒斯承认，美国代表团在提出这一问题时，原指望朝鲜战争迅速结束。但现在，照他的话说，情势已经根本改变了。
    国民党集团代表说，他并不反对在政委会工作的后期审议福摩萨问题。
    苏联代表马立克就这一问题发表声明。在声明中，他追述在总务委员会会议上与大会全体会议上，苏联代表团都曾竭力反对将福摩萨（台湾）问题列入议程。马立克指出，台湾岛归属中国的问题已由战时的协定加以解决，不能更改。他促请政委会的代表们注意开罗协定与波茨坦协定以及日本投降的条件。按照前两项协定，台湾岛已作为中国一个不可转让的部分归还中国，而日本投降的条件则更对上述国际协定加以肯定。马立克并着重指出，联合国一般说来并没有资格审议这个问题，因为这个问题已由各盟国间战时的协定加以解决。鉴于这一点，台湾问题应该从大会议程上撤销。
    马立克说：试想一想，如果有某一个代表团要把夏威夷群岛的问题或者该群岛的地位问题的讨论列入大会议程，那么，毫无疑问，美国政府会说，这个问题不应该在大会讨论，要讨论台湾问题也是同等荒谬！
    马立克说：联合国的任务是去审议美国对中华人民共和国的侵略——威胁远东和平与安全的侵略问题。他坚主政委会立即开始讨论在苏联代表团坚持下列入大会议程的下一问题：“苏联控诉美国侵略中国”案。
    政委会接着开始讨论一些程序问题。这些问题占去了下午会议的其余时间。国民党集团代表提出一项建议，要政委会开始审议国民党诬告苏联案。
    巴西代表建议政委会休会至十一月二十日再开会，因为大会在十一月十六日将举行全体会议。
    马立克反对政委会没有任何理由即中断其工作。他敦促政委会讨论议程上下一议案，即：美国侵略中国案。同时马立克提出关于邀请中华人民共和国代表参加政委会会议对这一问题之讨论的提案。苏联代表团的提案如下：
    “政治委员会，由于大会五届会议讨论‘苏联控诉美国侵略中国’问题，并鉴于中华人民共和国中央人民政府曾声明中华人民共和国代表应参加讨论上述问题，兹特决议：邀请中华人民共和国中央人民政府代表参加政治委员会会议关于‘苏联控诉美国侵略中国’问题的讨论。”
    在结束了程序问题的讨论后，政委会即开始表决。美国关于把福摩萨问题列在最后一项讨论的提议首先以五十三票获得通过，五票弃权（阿富汗、南斯拉夫、也门、叙利亚、缅甸）。国民党分子的提议继之提付表决，结果有十四票赞成，八票反对（包括苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、缅甸、黎巴嫩），三十六票弃权。这样，这一提议即被微不足道的多数通过。政委会主席将苏联代表团关于邀请中华人民共和国代表参加政委会会议的提案延至下次会议上讨论和表决。
    继而，巴西代表提议政委会休会至十一月二十日再开。这一提议以多数票获得通过。三十六票赞成，两票反对，二十票弃权。
