　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th: TASS Moscow, 15th: The General Secretary of the French Communist Party, Thorez, arrived in Moscow today for medical treatment. Currently, his health condition is good. He went to the Soviet Union for treatment on the advice of his doctors.
    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 16th: TASS Berlin, 16th: On November 15th, General Chuikov, Chairman of the Soviet Control Commission in Germany, delivered a letter to Mr. McCloy, the U.S. High Commissioner for Germany, calling McCloy's attention to the following facts: At 17:03 Moscow time on November 11, 1950, a Soviet C-47 passenger plane, carrying the ailing General Secretary of the French Communist Party and member of the French Parliament, Thorez, from Paris to Berlin, was attacked by a U.S. P-80 (Shooting Star) jet fighter over an area 50 kilometers west of Frankfurt. The jet fighter, bearing U.S. insignia, appeared 10 meters below the right wing of the Soviet aircraft, and after flying to the same altitude as the Soviet aircraft, made a sharp left turn in a combat posture 10 to 15 meters in front of the Soviet aircraft. After flying one kilometer away, the aircraft turned back and flew towards the Soviet aircraft again. At this point, our aircraft flew into the clouds. Only thanks to the skill of the Soviet pilot was the Soviet aircraft able to avoid the serious danger caused by the attack of the U.S. aircraft.
    The actions of the U.S. fighter plane can only be regarded as a deliberate provocation. Because we had informed the U.S. authorities of this flight in advance, and the U.S. authorities had also guaranteed the safety of this flight, this further proves that this action was a deliberate provocation.
    I hereby lodge a strong protest regarding this incident and demand that the perpetrators be severely punished.
    Please inform me of the measures taken in this matter.

　　美帝竟无耻袭击多列士专机
    崔可夫将军提出强硬抗议         
    多列士由巴黎经柏林抵莫斯科就医
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：法国共产党总书记多列士今日抵莫斯科就医。目前，他的健康状况尚佳。他是遵医生的嘱咐赴苏联治疗的。
    【新华社十六日讯】塔斯社柏林十六日讯：十一月十五日，苏联驻德管制委员会主席崔可夫上将向美国驻德高级专员麦克洛埃递送公函一件，促请麦克洛埃注意下列事实：一九五○年十一月十一日莫斯科时间十七点零三分，在法兰克福以西五十公里地区的上空，自巴黎载患病中的法国共产党总书记、法国议会议员多列士飞赴柏林的苏联Ｃ４７式客机，受到了美国Ｐ８０式（射星式）喷气战斗机的袭击。该漆有美国徽号的喷气战斗机，系在苏联飞机右翼下方十公尺处出现，并在飞至与苏联飞机同等高度后，在苏联飞机前面十公尺至十五公尺处以战斗姿式向左急转。该机俟飞至一公里后，又行回转，再次迎苏联飞机飞来。在此时际，我方飞机即飞入云中。只是靠了苏联驾驶员的机智，才使苏联飞机避免了由美国飞机袭击而引起的严重危险。
    美国战斗机的这种行动，只能认为是蓄意的挑衅。由于我们事先曾将这次飞行知照美国当局，而美国当局也曾保证这次飞行的安全，这就更加证明了这种行动是蓄意的挑衅了。
    我特就这次事件提出强硬抗议，并要求严惩肇事人员。
    请告诉我就此事采取的措施。
