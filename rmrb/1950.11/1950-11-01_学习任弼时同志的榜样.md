　　Learn from Comrade Ren Bishi's Example
　　Wulanfu
　　Comrade Ren Bishi was not only a great warrior and statesman of the Chinese people, but also the most loyal friend and mentor of the people of Inner Mongolia. His death has filled the Communist Party members, all commanders and soldiers of the Inner Mongolia Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the members of the Youth League, and the broad masses of Mongolian and Han people in our Inner Mongolia region with infinite grief!
　　Comrade Ren Bishi engaged in thirty years of consistent and unremitting revolutionary activity with infinite loyalty to the cause of Chinese national liberation, the cause of people's liberation, and the cause of the liberation of the working class. The great victory of the Chinese people is inseparable from his outstanding contributions to the revolution. To commemorate Comrade Bishi, we should learn from his spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, inherit his unfinished cause, and consolidate and develop the victory of the Chinese people.
　　Comrade Ren Bishi, with his principle and self-sacrificing spirit in his work, actively supported and developed the correct line of the Party, and became one of Comrade Mao Zedong's close comrades-in-arms. He theoretically linked with practice to apply and implement Mao Zedong Thought in various aspects of Party building; his Party spirit is a good example for us. To commemorate Comrade Bishi, all Communist Party members in Inner Mongolia should strengthen our Party spirit, rectify our work style, closely connect with the masses, so that the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shines throughout Inner Mongolia, and the Party's policies gain the full support of all the people of Inner Mongolia.
　　In order to commemorate and mourn this great warrior and statesman of the people, all Communist Party members, Youth League members, commanders and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and all patriotic people in our Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region should enthusiastically respond to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, learn from Comrade Ren Bishi's example, unite as one, and strive against the aggression of American imperialism, consolidate the national defense of the common motherland of all nationalities, and continue to carry forward the people's revolutionary struggle and the people's construction cause!
