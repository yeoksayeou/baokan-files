    [Xinhua News Agency, dated 9th] Telecommunications Agency, London, 8th: Many soldiers of the British 29th Brigade recently sent to Korea sang "The Red Flag" when they returned to the ship after taking shore leave in Colombo, Ceylon. This was revealed in letters written by soldiers of the brigade to their relatives in England, published in the *Daily Worker*. One soldier wrote: "Many soldiers, when walking onto the gangplank of the troopship 'Empress of Australia,' shouted: 'Let us go home and be civilians! Let us reunite with our wives and children!' They threw coconuts at the officers."
    The soldier also wrote that many soldiers on the ship had been detained, and two soldiers were to be court-martialed.
    Another soldier wrote that a gunner who had already been court-martialed gathered more than 500 people and publicly spoke out against the Korean War when the soldiers landed in Colombo Harbor. The soldier wrote: "What he said seemed to be the same as what many of us think about this bloody business. ... He is now waiting for court-martial on charges of insubordination and mutiny."
    [Xinhua News Agency, dated 9th] According to the Telecommunications Agency, London: British Labour MP, Mr. Pannell, in a speech on the Korean issue on the 5th, demanded the immediate arrest of Syngman Rhee and to be punished as a war criminal. He said: "The cruelty of the Syngman Rhee's henchmen, the mass murder of civilians and prisoners of war by Syngman Rhee's police, are all carried out under the banner of the United Nations."
    According to an Associated Press reporter's dispatch on the 6th, the Syngman Rhee gang continues to carry out massacres in Seoul. Sixteen men and four women were shot and killed by Syngman Rhee's military police with carbines on a small hill four miles west of Seoul on the 6th. The dispatch revealed that on November 5, twenty-seven Koreans were subjected to the same shooting.

    许多士兵高喊要回家去
    英一议员要求逮捕战犯李承晚
    【新华社九日讯】电通社伦敦八日讯：不久前派赴朝鲜的英军第二十九旅中许多士兵于经过锡兰的科伦坡上陆度假日后返回船上时，高唱“红旗歌”。这事是由《工人日报》所刊载该旅士兵写给在英亲属们的信中所透露的。有一个士兵写道：“许多士兵当走上运兵舰‘澳大利亚皇后号’的跳板时喊着说：‘让我们回去当老百姓！让我们去和妻子儿女团圆！’他们向军官们投掷椰子。”
    该士兵又写道：该船已有许多士兵被拘禁，有两个士兵还要受军法审讯。
    另一个士兵写道：有一个已受军法审讯的炮手，当士兵们在科伦坡港登陆时，召集了五百余人，公开发言反对朝鲜战争。该士兵写道：“他所说的，好像和我们许多人对这件流血勾当的看法一样。……他现在正等着受军法处分，罪名是抗命哗变。”
    【新华社九日讯】据电通社伦敦讯：英工党议员潘纳五日在关于朝鲜事件的演说中，要求立即逮捕李承晚并当作战犯惩办。他说：“李承晚走狗们的残酷，李承晚警察的大批谋杀平民和战俘，都是在联合国的旗帜下进行的。”
    另据美联社记者六日电李承晚匪帮继续在汉城进行大屠杀。十六名男人和四名妇女，于六日在汉城以西四英里的一座小山上，被李承晚宪兵以卡宾枪乱枪杀死。该电透露：十一月五日，二十七名朝鲜人遭到同样的枪杀。
