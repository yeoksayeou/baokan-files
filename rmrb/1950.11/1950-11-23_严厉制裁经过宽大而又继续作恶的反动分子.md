Severely Punish Reactionaries Who Continue to Do Evil After Being Treated with Leniency

Judging from some counter-revolutionary cases published in this newspaper today and in the past, the hidden American imperialist running dogs—the Kuomintang remnants, bandits, and secret agents—are intensifying their sabotage activities and even organizing armed rebellions. Many of the masterminds behind these armed rebellions are unrepentant elements who continue to do evil after being treated with leniency by the People's Government. This once again tells us that some reactionaries are determined to be enemies of the people. Their superficial "confessions" and "repentance" are merely a disguise to cover up their continued counter-revolutionary sabotage.

In the past, the People's Government gave lenient treatment to general reactionaries and even reactionaries with considerable crimes, giving them full education and forcing them to reform themselves through labor. The People's Government has already done its utmost. As a result, some reactionaries, under the influence of the People's Government, have recognized their crimes and are reforming themselves. Some of the better ones are either conscientiously engaged in labor, or participating in certain jobs, or assisting the People's Government in exposing secret agents and bandits, redeeming their crimes with practical actions, and they are beginning to move towards a new life. However, there are still some reactionaries who regard the People's Government's lenient treatment as weakness, have no remorse, and continue to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. Especially after the outbreak of the war of American imperialist aggression against Korea, they thought that "the time has come" and plotted to organize armed rebellions, thus arousing the people's deep hatred and pushing themselves to a dead end. As in the past, in the face of the powerful People's Public Security organs and under the watchful eyes of the broad masses of the people, their criminal activities are extremely difficult to succeed.

For reactionaries who have been treated with leniency by the People's Government, according to Article 7 of the Common Program: "If they continue to engage in counter-revolutionary activities, they must be severely punished." Because these reactionaries have not only become active offenders, but are also unrepentant, they must be severely punished.

On this issue, some regions and cities have handled it relatively well; while in some regions and cities, there is an erroneous idea among some cadres. They believe that reactionaries who have already confessed are free from trouble, forgetting that their actions should continue to be subject to necessary investigation, and "forced to reform themselves through labor and become new people" (Article 7 of the Common Program); instead, they have adopted a laissez-faire attitude of "not caring," which has made them dare to continue their criminal activities. After capturing these unrepentant reactionaries, they were not promptly and severely punished, which fueled their criminal activities. All these erroneous ideas and practices of "not caring and not handling" should be immediately corrected, and Mao Zedong's instructions in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" should be strictly implemented: "Exercise dictatorship, exercise dictatorship, over the running dogs of imperialism, namely the landlord class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and the Kuomintang reactionaries and their accomplices who represent these classes, oppress these people, only allow them to be well-behaved, and do not allow them to talk nonsense or act recklessly. If they want to talk nonsense or act recklessly, they will be immediately banned and punished."

　　严厉制裁经过宽大而又继续作恶的反动分子
    从本报今天所发表的和过去已发表的一些反革命案件来看，潜藏的美帝国主义走狗——国民党残余土匪特务，正加紧进行破坏活动，甚至组织武装叛乱，这些武装叛乱的祸首，许多是经过人民政府宽大而又继续作恶的怙恶不悛分子。这就再次告诉我们，一部分反动分子是死心与人民为敌的，他们表面上所作的“坦白”、“悔过”，只是为了掩蔽其继续进行反革命破坏的一种伪装。
    过去，人民政府对于一般的反动分子甚至罪恶颇大的反动分子，曾经给予了宽大处理，对他们进行了充分的教育，并强迫他们在劳动中改造自己。人民政府对待他们已经是“仁至义尽”了。因而一部分反动分子，在人民政府的感召下，认识了自己的罪恶，正在改造自己。其中比较好的，或则认真从事劳动，或则参加了一定工作，或则协助人民政府检举特务匪徒，以实际行动，立功赎罪，他们开始走向了新生的道路。但是，却还有一部分反动分子，竟视人民政府对他们的宽大处理为软弱，毫无悔罪之心，依然继续进行反革命活动。特别在美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争爆发后，他们更以为“时机已到”，阴谋组织武装叛乱，因而他们就引起了人民的万分痛恨，并把自己推上了绝路。如同过去一样，在强大的人民公安机关面前，在广大的人民注视下面，他们的罪恶活动是绝难得逞的。
    对于经过人民政府宽大处理之后的反动分子，按照共同纲领第七条规定：“假如他们继续进行反革命活动，必须予以严厉的制裁。”因为这些反动分子不仅已成为现行犯，而且怙恶不悛，非予以严厉制裁不可了。
    在这个问题上，有的地区以及若干城市，是处理得比较好的；而有些地区与城市，在部分干部中，则存在着一种错误的想法。以为已经坦白了的反动分子，就没有事了，忘记了对他们的行动应继续进行必要的考察，并“强迫他们在劳动中改造自己，成为新人”（共同纲领第七条）；而采取了一种放任“不管”的态度，这就使他们敢于继续其罪恶活动。而在捕获这些怙恶不悛的反动分子之后，又没有及时地加以严厉制裁，这就助长了他们的罪恶活动。所有这些“不管不办”的错误思想与作法，都应该立即加以纠正，严肃地执行毛主席在“论人民民主专政”中所给予我们的指示，“向着帝国主义的走狗即地主阶级和官僚资产阶级以及代表这些阶级的国民党反动派及其帮凶实行专政，实行独裁，压迫这些人，只许他们规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动。如要乱说乱动，立即取缔，予以制裁。”
