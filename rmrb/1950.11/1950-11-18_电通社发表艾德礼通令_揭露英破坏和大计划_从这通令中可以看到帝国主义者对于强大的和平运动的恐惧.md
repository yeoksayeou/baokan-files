Xinhua News Agency, November 17th: According to a report from TASS Prague on the 16th, the Prague office of the Telegraph Agency published an order issued by Attlee in mid-September to representatives of the British government stationed in several countries, exposing the British government's detailed plan to obstruct the peace conference. The order stated: Holding the peace conference in Western Europe is intended to gain broad support for the peace movement from the Western people and deepen the British people's impression of the peace movement. The order continued: "The British government is keenly aware of the potential role of the conference. In view of the danger this conference poses to the North Atlantic Treaty nations, the British government fully understands its responsibility, in accordance with the North Atlantic Treaty, to do everything possible to prevent the conference from taking place. The government's administrative measures are: not to allow any foreigner to enter Britain to organize the conference, and to immediately deport those who come to Britain to prepare for the peace conference but have not stated this in their application. Each visa application from foreign representatives will be judged according to the individual's circumstances." The order also stated: "The peace conference will unite world public opinion around the Soviet peace policy based on banning atomic weapons and declaring atomic weapons illegal," which will "create chaos in the North Atlantic Treaty nations." Therefore, "the British government suggests using all available means to show British and foreign public opinion the true nature of the peace movement (i.e., using all means to fabricate rumors and slander)."

    电通社发表艾德礼通令
    揭露英破坏和大计划
    从这通令中可以看到帝国主义者对于强大的和平运动的恐惧
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社布拉格十六日引电通社消息称：电通社布拉格办事处发表了一项艾德礼在九月中旬发给英国政府驻若干国家的代表的通令，暴露了英国政府阻止和平大会的详细计划。该通令中称：和平大会在西欧召开，是要使和平运动获得西方人民的广泛支持，使英国人民加深对和平运动的印象。通令继称：“英国政府牢记着大会的潜在作用。鉴于此次大会对于北大西洋公约国家的危险，英国政府充分了解依照北大西洋公约，有责任尽一切力量阻止大会开会。政府的行政措施是：不允许任何一个外国人进入英国组织大会，把来英筹备和平大会而在申请书上未加说明的人立即驱逐出境。外国代表的每份签证申请书，都将按照本人的情况予以判断。”通令又称：“和平大会将要把世界舆论团结在以禁止原子武器并宣布原子武器非法为基础的苏联和平政策的周围”，这就要“在北大西洋公约国中造成混乱”，因此，“英国政府建议利用一切可资利用的方法，向英国及国外舆论表明和平运动的真正性质（按即利用一切方法进行造谣毁谤）”。
