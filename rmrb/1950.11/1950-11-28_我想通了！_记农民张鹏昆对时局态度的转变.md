　　"I've figured it out!"
    ——An account of farmer Zhang Pengkun's change in attitude towards the current situation
    Yu Changqin
    Since the United States sent troops to invade Korea, many rumors have been circulating in Baodao Village, a suburb of Shenyang. At first, no one believed them, but as time went on, the rumors became more and more fierce. People with a vague understanding of current events began to half-believe and half-doubt, and some even mistakenly believed them, becoming anxious. Poor peasant Zhang Pengkun was one of them.

    One day at the end of last month, just after sunset, the farmers of the whole village, with the happy mood of harvest, gathered at the small schoolhouse with three wide tile rooms at the south end of the village. As with previous mass meetings, everyone chatted and joked at the beginning, but it didn't take as long as usual for the meeting to fall into an unprecedented silence. The teacher standing in front of everyone did not announce "good news" to everyone in a lively manner as before, but used an indignant tone to expose the conspiracy of enemy special agents' rumors, and also told everyone that the United States was following the old path of the Japanese invaders invading China, and was attacking our home. Therefore, we must resist America and aid Korea to protect our homes and defend our country.

    After this meeting, several meetings were held in the village one after another, and five propaganda groups were organized. More than 20 households were equipped with radios, and groups of people gathered every night to listen to the broadcast. Zhang Pengkun, who usually didn't stand out much, has recently become interested in these activities, asking everyone about the war situation in Korea.

    Since Zhang Pengkun heard the teacher's report for the first time, he has been feeling uneasy, tossing and turning in bed for several nights, unable to fall asleep. He was both afraid and angry. Old Zhang had not gone to school and was a bit slow-witted, and didn't understand the long series of principles that others spoke of, but as soon as he heard that the American devils were going to attack, he inexplicably recalled the situation when the puppet Manchurian Japanese devils were around. At that time, he couldn't pay the "shipment" (agricultural tax), and the police kicked and punched him, cursing "Baga," scaring him so much that he didn't even dare to breathe; he hid from forced labor and fled to the city to work as a coolie, eating thin gruel for one meal but not the next; his mother died, and to buy a plain coffin, he tearfully sold the five acres of land left by his ancestors...

    The life of a subjugated slave was really unbearable, and he looked forward to "restoration" day and night, but he never expected that the "disaster army" and the "gouging people party" would come after the restoration. The past three years have been even worse. The house he lived in leaked starlight and moonlight, and he ate soybean cakes mixed with bran, and his whole family almost lost their lives... Thinking of these things, he felt extremely sad.

    Continuing to think, he thought of the thirty acres of flat land he had received after the land reform, the newly built house with large glass windows, the red sorghum piled high in the granary, the stacks of cotton quilts on the cabinet, and his youngest son skipping and jumping to school... Thinking of these things was a different kind of feeling. But immediately came a feeling of fear, as if the satisfactory scene before him would soon be lost. This was when he thought of the news broadcasted by the radio about the American troops approaching our border.

    After several days of thinking back and forth, Zhang Pengkun, who had been thinking about it constantly, and constantly heard about the actions of farmers in various places resisting America and aiding Korea to protect their homes and defend their country, one day, in a daze, he realized in the middle of the night that the home and the country were originally breathing through the same nostrils. To protect the home, one must defend the country. The thought of fear disappeared, and all that remained was hatred for American imperialism.

    The next day, he brought back his eldest son, Zhang Fuquan, who was working outside, early in the morning. After discussing it, the son asked the village staff to volunteer to resist America and aid Korea to protect the home and defend the country. This matter happening in Old Zhang's family was a surprise to the village staff. They solemnly went to solicit Zhang Pengkun's opinion, and he answered very simply: "I told him to go! I've figured it out!"

    Originally, Zhang Pengkun was relatively backward in political awareness in Baodao Village, and he only saw himself in everything, fearing that he would suffer a loss. When the village held meetings, he mostly sent his children to participate, fearing that it would delay his work; he was late in delivering public grain last winter; during the "three major festivals" (Spring Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival), when everyone initiated condolences to military families, he gave the least. Therefore, others said behind his back that he was "selfish and self-interested." He occasionally heard this unflattering comment, but he did not refute it, but thought: "What's private or not private, beneficial or not beneficial? It's true to live a good life."

    The American imperialists' invasion of the Chinese border gradually made him understand the principle that the people cannot be at peace if the country is not prosperous. Therefore, he is determined to protect his home and defend his country. In addition to sending his son to Korea to participate in the war, this year's public grain, like all the farmers in the village, he had already prepared before the levy, in order to strengthen the national defense force.

　　“我想通了！”
    ——记农民张鹏昆对时局态度的转变
    于长钦
    自美国出兵侵略朝鲜以来，沈阳市郊包道屯流传着不少谣言，最初谁也不相信，可是日子长了，谣言也越来越凶，对时事认识模糊的人，就半信半疑起来，甚至有的误信，提心吊胆。贫农张鹏昆就是其中一个。
    上月底有一天太阳刚落黑，全屯农民都怀着丰收后的愉快心情，向着屯子南头三间宽敞瓦房的小学校聚集。和从前每次群众大会一样，开头大伙七言八语的说笑和打闹，但没有吵闹得象往常那么久，会场里即出现了从来未有的沉静。站在大家前面讲话的教员，也不像以前那样活泼的向大伙宣布“好消息”，而是用激愤的腔调，揭露了敌特谣言的阴谋，还告诉大家美国正在走当年日寇侵略中国的老路，向我们的家边打来，所以必须抗美援朝，保家卫国。
    此次大会以后，村里又接二连三的开了几次会，并组织了五个宣传组，还有二十多户人家按设了收音机，每晚都有成群的人围听广播。平常不大出头的张鹏昆，最近对这些活动也发生了兴趣，逢人就问朝鲜的战局。
    张鹏昆自头一次听了教员的报告后，心里老是七上八下的，好几夜躺在炕上翻来复去的不能入睡。又是怕又是怒。老张没念过书，心眼又有点笨，不大懂别人讲的一串大道理，可是一听说美国鬼子要打来，不知怎么一下子就联想起伪满小日本鬼子在时的情景。那时自己交不上“出荷”，警察拳打脚踢，大骂“叭嘎”，吓得自己连气都不敢喘；躲劳工逃到城里当苦力，橡面粥吃了上顿没下顿；妈妈死了，买口白皮棺材，含泪出卖了祖辈留下来的五亩地……
    亡国奴生活实在过不下去，日夜盼望“光复”，没想到光复后来了“遭殃军”“刮民党”。三年来更够呛，住的房子漏星漏月，吃豆饼，掺糠皮，一家老少差点都丢了命……。想到这些，真是心酸透顶。
    继续想下去，便是土地改革后分得的三十亩平地，新修了按有大块玻璃窗户的房子，囤子里满满的红色高粱，柜子上成叠的棉被，小儿子蹦蹦跳跳地上学……，想到这些又是另一种滋味。但马上就来了恐惧心理，似乎眼前这种满意的光景，很快就要失去。这便是又想到广播电台发出的美军向我国境迫近的消息。
    老张经过几天来的左思右想，思前想后，加上不断听到各地农民抗美援朝，保家卫国的行动，有一天昏昏沉沉的想到半夜，省悟到家和国原来是一个鼻孔喘气，要保家就得卫国，怕的念头没有了，剩下的只是对美帝的仇恨。
    第二天，他一早把在外做工的大儿子张福全找了回来，父子俩商量了一番，儿子就向村上的工作人员要求去志愿抗美援朝保家卫国。此事出在老张家，真是出乎村上工作人员们的意外，便郑重地亲去征求张鹏昆的意见，他倒很干脆的回答：“是我叫他去的！我想通了！”
    原来，张鹏昆在包道屯是政治认识较落后的，事事都只看到自己，怕自己吃亏。屯里开大会，多是差小孩子参加，很怕耽误自己的工夫；去冬送公粮，他拉后；“三大节”（春节、端午节、仲秋节）大伙发起慰问军属，他拿的东西最少。因此，别人背后都说他“自私自利”，他偶而听到这种不光彩的评语，也不反驳，倒想：“什么私不私，利不利的，把日子过好是真的。”
    美帝向中国边境进犯，使他逐渐懂得了国不泰民就不得安的道理。因此他决心保家卫国。除送儿子去朝鲜参战外，今年的公粮，他和全屯农民一样，在开征之前，就早已准备妥当，以便壮大国防力量。
