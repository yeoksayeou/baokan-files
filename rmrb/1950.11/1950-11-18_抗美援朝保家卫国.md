　　Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation
　　Sun Fuling, Standing Committee Member and Secretary-General of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce
　　"Imperialism cannot survive without atrocities and plunder, without blood and shooting. That is the nature of imperialism," said Marshal Stalin.
　　"The imperialists and their running dog reactionaries will not be reconciled to their defeat on this land of China. They will collude with each other and use all possible means to oppose the Chinese people," said Chairman Mao.
　　The US imperialists' frenzied expansion of the war of aggression against Korea, directly threatening our country's security, and their beastly rampage prove that the above words of Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao are completely correct.
　　People from all walks of life across the country, whether in factories, mines, schools, or organizations, unable to tolerate the肆行bullying of the imperialists, have ignited the flames of anger. In the boiling patriotic fervor, everyone has unanimously issued the roar of "Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation."
　　For the sake of justice, for the sake of lasting world peace, for the sake of our own interests and security, today we must stand up, eliminate the imperialist warmongers, and educate those bloodthirsty animals with the power of iron.
　　Today, we must realize that leniency towards the aggressor is cruelty towards ourselves. Chiang Kai-shek's policy of non-resistance in the Northeast emboldened the Japanese warlords to launch the Lugouqiao Incident. The Munich Conference encouraged Hitler's ambition to conquer Europe. The bloody events in history clearly tell us: standing before robbers, standing before devils, the only way is to eliminate them, to send them to the grave. There is no other way.
　　In the midst of the nationwide people's enthusiastic call to resist America and aid Korea, the more than 30,000 households in Beijing's industry and commerce, accounting for a large part of the city's population, have an even greater need to strengthen and be vigilant. Some say that, based on general observations, there are no problems with the workers in the industrial and commercial sector, but some backward ideas still exist among certain merchants. Today, we should read more about the history of US imperialist aggression against China, find more materials about the essence of US imperialism, and abandon all incorrect ideas of being pro-American or fearing America. We must also know that today's New China is a new, normal society with organization and discipline, so only by following the normal track can we succeed. Past erroneous thoughts and behaviors must be diligently corrected today, so as not to be abandoned by the times.
　　We firmly believe that China, with the victorious Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao's banner, is fully capable of stopping imperialist aggression, has the strength to assist the Korean people in achieving liberation, and has the certainty of winning our victory in protecting our homes and defending the nation. The facts today tell us that the Korean People's Army, fighting alongside the Chinese People's Volunteers, has recovered many important strongholds, repelled the enemy, and is launching a battle to encircle and annihilate the enemy in the vicinity of the Cheongcheon River. The invading US troops will gradually fall in the face of the people's power. However, we cannot sit here and wait for victory to arrive. We must firm our iron will, mobilize together, and under the banner of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, each of us must stand at our own post, and be enthusiastic in preparing to respond to every call from the government. We unanimously support the joint declaration of the democratic parties. We unanimously support the declaration issued by the city's industrial and commercial circles at the Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation rally held on the 8th of this month, and faithfully put into practice the five covenants in the declaration with practical actions. We must stabilize the rear, stabilize prices, adapt to military and civilian needs, and take the interests of resisting America and aiding Korea as the starting point for all actions and all work, and wholeheartedly complete our glorious historical task.

　　抗美援朝保家卫国
    北京工商联合会常委兼秘书长  孙孚凌
    “帝国主义如果没有暴行和掠夺，没有血和射击，是不能活下去的，帝国主义的天性就是这样。”斯大林大元帅这样说过。
    “帝国主义者及其走狗反动派，对于它在中国这块土地上的失败，是不会甘心的，他们还要互相勾结一起，用各种可能的方法，反对中国人民。”毛主席这样说过。
    美帝今天由侵朝疯狂地扩大战争，直接威胁我国的安全，野兽般的横行，证明了斯大林大元帅和毛主席所说的上面的话是完全正确的。
    全国各地各界人民，无论在工厂、在矿山、在学校、在机关团体的人民，由于不能容忍帝国主义者的肆行欺凌，纷纷燃起了愤怒之火，在爱国热血沸腾中，大家一致发出了“抗美援朝保家卫国”的吼声。
    为了正义、为了世界持久和平，为了我们本身的利害与安全，今天只有站起来，消灭帝国主义战争贩子，用铁的力量教育那些嗜血动物。
    今天我们要认识到：对侵略者的宽大，便是对自己的残忍，蒋介石在东北实行不抵抗主义，怂恿了日本军阀发动芦沟桥事变；慕尼黑会议，鼓励了希特勒征服欧洲的野心，历史上血迹斑斑的事迹明确的告诉我们：站在强盗面前，站在魔鬼面前，只有把它消灭，把它送进坟墓中去，除此，是没有第二条路可走的。
    在全国人民一致激昂地抗美援朝声中，北京工商业三万多户，占首都全市人口的一大部分，我们更有健全自己、警惕自己的必要。有人说：工商界根据一般的观察，在工人是没有什么问题，而在某些商人还有存在一些落后观念，今天，我们应该多翻一翻美帝侵华的历史，多找一找美帝实质的资料，摒绝一切亲美恐美的不正确思想意识，我们更要知道，今天新中国社会是个有组织有纪律的一个崭新的正常的社会，所以只有循着正常的轨道才能走得通。过去的错误思想和行为，今天必须努力改正过来，方可免得被时代扬弃在后面。
    我们坚决地确认：中国有胜利的中国共产党毛主席的旗帜，是完全可以制止帝国主义侵略的，是有力量可以援助朝鲜人民取得解放，是有把握赢得我们保家卫国的胜利的。事实今天告诉我们：朝鲜人民解放军在和中国人民志愿军比肩作战之下，已收复许多重要据点，击退敌人，正在清川江一带展开围歼敌人的战火，侵朝美军会在人民力量的面前，渐渐的倒下去的。但是，我们不能在此坐待胜利的到来，必须坚定我们的铁石意志，一致动员起来，在中国共产党毛主席旗帜之下，每个人站在我们自己的岗位上，热诚的准备响应政府每一号召，我们一致拥护各民主党派的联合宣言，我们一致拥护全市工商界本月八日举行抗美援朝保家卫国大会发表的宣言，并忠诚的以实际行动来实践大会宣言里面的五项公约，必定做到安定后方，稳定物价，适应军需民需，一切行动，一切工作，以抗美援朝利益为出发，全心全意地完成我们历史的光荣任务。
