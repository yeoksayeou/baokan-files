The Chinese working class, peasant class, petty bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie, and all patriotic people must correctly understand the United States.

In the past, some Chinese people were fooled by American imperialism, believing that China needed to rely on the United States and should treat it as a good friend. Some also thought that the United States was a very civilized and democratic country and that China should learn from it. Still others thought that the United States was so strong that no one could afford to provoke it.

In fact, pro-American ideas are reactionary, and ideas of worshipping or fearing America are also wrong.

After fully understanding the truth about the United States, every patriotic Chinese should hate, despise, and scorn the United States!

(I) Hate the United States, because it is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people.

Currently, the United States is openly invading our country and is preparing to carry out further aggression against us:

1.  After the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, it openly occupied our territory of Taiwan. A large number of American warships and aircraft have been stationed in Taiwan, and MacArthur has publicly announced that he will turn Taiwan into an American military base. The purpose of the United States is to make Taiwan a springboard for invading mainland China.

2.  The American aggression in Korea is expanding daily. The American government has disregarded our warnings and allowed the American invading forces to cross the 38th parallel and approach our northeastern border. The American aggression in Korea has threatened our security. The American plan is to further invade our country after completely occupying Korea. In April 1948, Syngman Rhee submitted a draft of the "Korean-American Alliance Treaty" to the American government, stating in the first article: "Both parties recognize and agree that if the war of liberation (referring to the American war of aggression) must continue on the territory of Manchuria to respond to the Chinese Communist aggression against Korea, the President of the United States of America will assist the President of the Republic of Korea in carrying out the war of liberation to a victorious conclusion." A Washington dispatch from Agence France-Presse on October 4th also stated: "Some American public opinion strongly advocates that American troops must cross northern Korea and enter Manchuria, which is currently occupied by Chinese Communist troops." The United States is now following the old path taken by Japan in the past. Japan first invaded Korea and Taiwan, and then from Korea to the Northeast, to North China, and to all of China.

3.  American planes and warships are constantly provoking our country. American planes have repeatedly intruded into our northeastern territory to conduct reconnaissance, bombing, and strafing on August 27th, 29th, September 22nd, October 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 20th, 21st, 22nd, 24th, and 25th. On October 7th and 14th, American planes again conducted reconnaissance and strafing in our coastal areas of Shandong. On September 20th, American warships shelled and illegally searched our merchant ships in our territorial waters near Chengshanjiao, Shandong. This series of provocative actions by the United States proves that the United States is determined to expand its aggression.

4.  The United States is still aiding the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in its struggle, and American arms and other supplies are constantly being shipped to Taiwan. American officers are training the remaining Kuomintang troops. According to incomplete data, since January of this year, the United States and Canada have given the Chiang bandits hundreds of aircraft and hundreds of tanks.

5.  The United States does not allow our country to participate in the United Nations and the Allied Council for Japan, but insists on letting the Taiwan Kuomintang bandit gang, the enemy of the Chinese people, illegally occupy our seat. Since January of this year, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai has repeatedly requested the United Nations to expel the illegal Kuomintang bandit representatives and accept the representatives of the People's Republic of China. The Soviet Union has also repeatedly made the same suggestions in the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council, but these reasonable requests and suggestions have been rejected by the United States and the vassal states under its command.

6.  The United States is actively supporting and arming Japan. The Japanese fascist forces are being revived. Many Japanese war criminals who invaded China have been released by MacArthur. The Japanese army is being rebuilt under the name of the "Police Reserve Force." The Japanese police force now has 125,000 members. At the beginning of this year, Whitney, the Chief of the Civil Affairs Bureau of MacArthur Headquarters, submitted a secret memorandum to the Yoshida government, planning to expand the Japanese armed forces to 500,000. This plan is already being implemented. The Japanese navy is also being restored. The so-called "Maritime Safety Agency" now has 300 ships. The purpose of the United States is to use Japan as the vanguard of American aggression in the Far East. The United States is now planning to make peace with Japan separately from China and the Soviet Union. The purpose of the United States in doing so is to facilitate the open support of the revival of Japanese aggression forces.

7.  The United States has established a vast network of military bases in the Pacific. This network of bases, starting from the American military base in Alaska, extends through the Aleutian Islands, Japan, Ryukyu, Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Borneo, Sumatra, and Vietnam, all the way to Thailand, Burma, and even India. It can be seen that this base network takes a surrounding posture against New China. MacArthur has publicly admitted that this base network is aimed at China and the Soviet Union. In order to jointly surround and oppress China diplomatically, militarily, and economically, the United States has ordered Britain, France, Australia, Japan, the Philippines, Thailand, and some other countries to take the same steps. These countries are now becoming increasingly hostile to the interests of our country and our overseas Chinese.

8.  In addition to carrying out open aggression against our country, the United States also attempts to sabotage our country from within. The American intelligence agencies are colluding with the Kuomintang intelligence agencies, directing special agents and bandits to carry out various sabotage activities inside our country. The United States has established a network of spies around New China, from Korea to India. Hong Kong, Bangkok, and other places have become strongholds for the US-Chiang special agent activities against our country. Tokyo and Taiwan are their command centers. The United States has opened spy schools in Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines, and Korea, training a large number of special agents. These special agents are sent to mainland China after graduation to carry out activities. According to Southwest statistics, 60 percent of the major bandit leaders in the southwestern provinces have received US-Chiang special agent training.

The above is about the current situation. Looking back at history, the United States has also consistently invaded our country. The main facts can be listed as follows:

1.  Like Britain, the United States was also one of the earliest opium dealers to ship opium to China. In 1839, a large part of the opium confiscated by Lin Zexu in Guangzhou came from the hands of Americans. During the Opium War, American naval commander Kearny personally led a fleet to the Chinese waters to support the British army. In July 1844, it forced the Qing government to sign the Treaty of Wangxia with the United States, which first established the clauses of "extraterritoriality" and "equal opportunity". The so-called "extraterritoriality" meant that Americans could not be subject to Chinese law if they committed crimes in China. The so-called "equal opportunity" meant that the United States wanted to share the benefits of invading China with other countries. The Treaty of Wangxia was one of the earliest unequal treaties signed between the Qing government and foreign governments.

2.  When the Anglo-French allied forces invaded our country and advanced into Tianjin and Beijing from 1857 to 1860, American warships also participated in the action and took the opportunity to coerce the Qing government into signing the Sino-American Tianjin Treaty (1858), obtaining aggressive rights such as restricting Chinese tariffs, navigating Chinese inland rivers, and freedom of preaching.

3.  In 1862, the American Consul General in Shanghai instructed Americans such as Ward to jointly organize troops with the British to help the Qing government suppress the Taiping Rebellion.

4.  In 1872, the American army attacked Korea, and in 1873 it jointly attacked Taiwan with Japan. In the same year, the American army attacked Korea, and in 1874 it jointly attacked Korea with the Japanese army.

5.  In 1900, the United States participated in the Eight-Nation Alliance to attack China and, in the Boxer Protocol, jointly obtained the right to station troops in Beijing and other places with other imperialist countries.

6.  In September 1917, American Secretary of State Lansing and Japanese Foreign Minister Ishii signed an agreement recognizing Japanese aggression interests in China. In 1918, they recognized Japan's succession to Germany's aggression rights in Shandong at the Paris Peace Conference.

7.  From 1922 to 1924, provided munitions and loans to the Zhili warlords Cao Kun and Wu Peifu to conduct civil war.

8.  Participated in the May 30th Massacre in 1925, slaughtering Chinese people.

9.  In April 1927, in order to suppress the Chinese Great Revolution, especially to pressure Chiang Kai-shek to surrender to imperialism, jointly shelled Nanjing with Britain, causing the Xiaguan Massacre.

10. From 1931 to 1933, assisted Chiang Kai-shek in attacking the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army led by the Chinese Communist Party with loans (including one for 50 million US dollars), aircraft and military advisors.

11. Supplied large amounts of military materials to Japan during the Japanese invasion of China. According to Japanese official materials, in 1937, American imports of military supplies to Japan accounted for 33.5 percent of Japan's total imports of military supplies, and in March 1940 it increased to 38.7 percent. American scrap iron exports to Japan still accounted for 70 percent of Japan's total scrap iron imports by the end of 1941.

12. After Japan's surrender, actively invaded China, attempting to replace Japan in ruling China and turning China into an American colony. On November 4, 1946, it signed the famous aggressive treaty "Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation" with Chiang Kai-shek, seizing China's economic sovereignty, tariff sovereignty, and coastal and inland navigation rights. This treaty was actually a new "Twenty-One Demands." Even British parliamentarians called it "the most barbaric economic aggression ever seen" against China.

13. After Japan's surrender, assisted Chiang Kai-shek in launching a large-scale anti-people civil war with money, munitions, weapons, materials, and military advisors. From Japan's surrender to June 1948, according to known materials, the United States gave Chiang Kai-shek various assistance totaling 4.346 billion US dollars. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the United States had given Chiang Kai-shek 1.567 billion US dollars in assistance, and most of this assistance was also retained by Chiang Kai-shek as capital for launching a civil war after the end of the War of Resistance. The two items totaled 5.916 billion US dollars, which is the huge investment made by the United States in Chiang Kai-shek's anti-people civil war.

(II) Despise the United States, because it is a corrupt imperialist country and the headquarters of reaction and degeneration in the world.

1.  The United States is now ruled by a small number of large capitalists, and the American government is a tool in their hands. American President Truman is a loyal lackey of the American large capitalists. The American large capitalists have a joint organization called the "National Association of Manufacturers," which owns about 16,000 large enterprises and controls about 60 billion US dollars in capital. The association's leadership organization, the "Committee of Twelve," is composed of representatives of the largest American capitalists such as Morgan, Rockefeller, Mellon, and DuPont. The American large capitalists mainly use this organization to determine the policies of the American government. The domestic and foreign policies implemented by the American government are all issued by the association or agreed upon with it. The association's own published pamphlet also states that the leadership of the National Association of Manufacturers "maintains daily contact with congressional leaders and leaders of various departments and bureaus, collects information for its members, and informs the relevant administrative agencies (referring to American government agencies) of the views of industrial groups on current issues." Leading figures in the American government, such as Secretary of State Acheson, Chairman of the National Security Resources Board Symington, Truman's special assistant advisor Harriman, State Department foreign policy advisor Dulles in charge of the Japanese peace treaty negotiations, US Permanent Representative to the United Nations Austin, and US High Commissioner to West Germany McCloy, are all sent to the Truman government by the association. Acheson is the owner of the famous American law firm "Covington, Dalinger, Acheson & Co.," which serves the Morgan, Rockefeller, and DuPont consortia. Harriman is one of the largest wealthy people in the United States and the manager of the "Brown Brothers Harriman Bank." Symington was the manager of "Emerson Electric Company" during the war. McCloy is an advisor to Rockefeller's "Chase Bank." According to the material in Becker's book "American Imperialism and the Marshall Plan," in early 1948 alone, Truman appointed 50 bankers, financiers, and industrialists to leading positions in the American government. American large capitalists control every move of the American government through these agents. The ruling Democratic Party and Republican Party of the United States are both under the direct control of large capitalists. Many of the main leaders of the two parties are themselves large capitalists or people connected to large capitalists. For example, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee was at one time Leskobu, who was one of the directors of "DuPont Company" and "General Motors Company." Weir, who was connected to Morgan, and Scott, a large industrialist in Philadelphia, were once leaders of the Republican Party. The American Congress is also directly controlled by large capitalists. According to materials from the Soviet newspaper Izvestia, the current American Congress has 68 large manufacturers, 13 bankers, and more than 300 lawyers serving in large companies and banks.

2.  The domestic policy of the United States is a policy of oppressing and exploiting the people, strangling democracy, and strangling culture:

    (A) American large capitalists control the vast majority of the country's wealth. They control the country's economic life, while the vast majority of the people live in extreme poverty. According to statistics, the 200 largest companies in the United States controlled 19 to 21 percent of the country's wealth in 1933, 46 to 51 percent of the country's industrial wealth, and 60 percent of the tangible assets of all companies (excluding finance). In 1947, there were 45 large companies (including financial and non-financial) with assets of more than 1 billion US dollars, controlling assets totaling 1,034.5 billion US dollars. According to a book about the situation of American labor by the Soviet Kukinski, the total net profit of major American companies in the seven years from 1940 to 1946 was 66.5 billion US dollars, which exceeded the total national income of the United States in 1938. But what is the living situation of the vast American people? According to the 68th issue of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!": On the eve of World War II, the laboring people, who accounted for about 80 percent of the American population, only received 44.4 percent of the national income. According to a recent report published by the US Census Bureau: In 1948, the income of more than 50 percent of American families was not enough to maintain a minimum standard of living; since 1948, the income of more than 57 percent of American families has not been enough to maintain a minimum standard of living. The total number of unemployed and underemployed people in the United States has reached 18 million. More than 10 million people in the United States have no housing, and another 40 million people live in dirty and cramped slums. According to materials from the American "Family Service Society," in New York, the largest city in the United States, about 260,000 families have no housing, and another 500,000 families live in slums. This is the true content of the "American way of life" that American propaganda agencies are trying their best to tout.

    (B) The so-called "democracy" in the United States is completely hypocritical. "Democratic" rights are only enjoyed by the rich, while the democratic rights of the vast majority of the people have been completely deprived. The American election system is just a deceptive trick. Voters' rights are subject to more than 60 kinds of restrictions, including property, race, and residence. In the 1948 presidential and congressional elections, one-third of the voters were deprived of their right to vote. Industrial workers account for 50 percent of the total population of the United States, but there is not a single worker representative in Congress. Not only do the people have no freedom to vote, but they also have no freedom of speech, publication, assembly, or association. Like Chiang Kai-shek's rule, intelligence agencies control everything. The Federal Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice is a large-scale intelligence agency with more than 14,000 plainclothes detectives responsible for persecuting the people. They have conducted investigations into the thoughts, lives, and actions of 2 million civil servants and forced them to perform the so-called "loyalty oath." Due to racial discrimination, black people suffer even more cruel oppression. They cannot go to school, walk on the street, or ride in vehicles with white people, and are often insulted and killed arbitrarily. The American ruling class uses all means to oppress the Communist Party. American Communist Party General Secretary Dennis and eleven other Communist Party leaders have been unreasonably interrogated by the American authorities, and Dennis has been imprisoned. The House Un-American Activities Committee is dedicated to persecuting the Communist Party and all progressive people. Recently, Congress passed a so-called "Anti-Subversion Act" (also called the McCarran Act), intending to use this act to further persecute the Communist Party and all progressive forces. The activities of fascist terrorist organizations such as the "Ku Klux Klan," the "American Legion," the "America First Committee," and the "Silver Shirt Legion" are also becoming increasingly rampant. These many facts show that the United States has become the headquarters of fascist reaction.

    (C) As a result of bourgeois rule and oppression, American culture has become completely corrupt and degenerate. The American publishing industry and news media are almost entirely controlled by a small number of large capitalists. The author of the book "One Thousand Americans," Sedes, said: "Ninety-nine percent of newspapers and magazines belong to large capitalists. They are consistent with the system established by twelve large companies and wealthy people." The National Publishers Association, the National Newspaper Publishers Association, and the National Manufacturers Association are actually brothers. They are all agencies of large capitalists. Under the control of monopoly capitalists, all newspapers, magazines, and other publications have become tools for instigating war and opposing democracy. Science and art are also tightly controlled by monopoly capitalists. They force these things to serve imperialist aggression. Science is not used for construction but for war. Scientists are busy manufacturing inhumane weapons of mass destruction such as atomic bombs and germ weapons. Art does not promote progress but promotes degeneration. Most of American literature, film, drama, and art promote things like corruption, degeneration, money worship, pornography and theft, weirdness and absurdity, and war mania. The American large capitalists' attempt is to use these toxic things to poison the minds of the younger generation, corrupt their moral values, make their spirits degenerate, and stagnate the development of their intelligence, so that they can be driven to serve aggression and war.

3.  The foreign policy of the United States is a policy of aggression and war:

    (A) American aggression extends to five continents. The main ways it carries out aggressive expansion are:

    (1) Directly launching armed aggression, such as the recent aggression against Korea and against the Chinese territory of Taiwan.

    (2) Helping other imperialist countries in their aggression, such as helping Britain invade Malaya and helping France invade Vietnam.

    (3) Aiding reactionaries in many colonial or semi-colonial countries to wage anti-people civil wars. For example, in the past, it supported Chiang Kai-shek in attacking the Chinese people, supported the Greek royal fascist government in attacking the Greek people, and is now supporting the Quirino puppet government of the Philippines in attacking the Filipino people.

    (4) Supporting reactionaries in various countries to suppress democratic forces in various countries. For example, supporting the revival of Japanese and German fascist forces, suppressing democratic forces in Japan and Germany, supporting the Spanish Franco fascist government, attempting to allow it to join the United Nations, instructing the governments of Australia, Bolivia, Venezuela, Panama, and other countries to declare the Communist Party illegal, and instructing the governments of Britain, France, Italy, West Germany, Canada, Japan, and other countries to suppress the Communist Party.

    (5) Using economic assistance to control other capitalist countries. For example, using the Marshall Plan to control the economies and politics of Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Turkey, Luxembourg, Portugal, Indonesia, Sweden, and other countries, to promote the fascistization of the governments of these countries, and to force them to prepare for war.

    (B) The United States is actively preparing for and advocating a third world war:

    (1) The United States has established countless military bases in the world. Korea, Japan, the Philippines, India, Vietnam, Turkey, Greece, France, Britain, West Germany, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and other places have American naval and air bases.

    (2) The United States is greatly expanding its military and military spending is constantly increasing. Truman has announced that he will increase the number of troops in the army, navy, and air force from 1.5 million to 3 million in the shortest possible time. The original appropriation for regular military expenses for the United States in 1950-51 was more than 15 billion US dollars, and the US Congress passed an additional budget of more than 15 billion US dollars for 1950-1951 proposed by Truman in September. In addition, the United States is also forcing Western European countries to expand their military.

    (3) Clamoring about atomic bombs and stubbornly rejecting the Soviet Union's proposal at the United Nations General Assembly to ban atomic weapons and reduce armaments by one-third.

    (4) Actively arming West Germany and Japan, attempting to make them the vanguard of American aggression. In mid-September, the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and France passed a decision to arm West Germany.

    (5) Took the lead in signing war preparation conventions such as the Atlantic Treaty and the Inter-American Treaty. In addition, it is brewing the signing of the Pacific Treaty, attempting to use it to recruit reactionary forces from various Far Eastern countries to prepare for war and oppose the People's Republic of China.

    (6) Undermining the principle of unanimity of the five great powers of the United Nations Security Council, attempting to further transform the United Nations into an instrument of aggression.

    (7) Frenziedly conducting war propaganda. American Secretary of the Navy Matthews publicly announced in a speech on August 25th that he would "compel peaceful cooperation at any cost, even at the cost of launching a war," and said that he was not afraid of "getting the title of initiator of a war of aggression." On October 24th, Truman publicly announced in his speech that "the only policy" that the United States "is now firmly adhering to" and will "continue to pursue" is "the policy of increasing its armed forces," and that the United Nations "must be prepared to use force."

    (C) The policy of aggression and war is in line with the interests of American large capitalists, because this can not only win them colonies, but also enable them to obtain huge profits from military orders. According to Soviet Izvestia materials, the total amount of net profit obtained by American industrial groups in World War II was more than 53 billion US dollars. In 1942, the total profits of five joint-stock companies exceeded more than 100 times the average profit from 1936 to 1939. Materials published by the American news agency United Press prove that due to Truman's policy of preparing for war, the total value of assets of 56 industrial groups expanded from 103.5 billion US dollars to 135 billion US dollars in two years (from 1947 to 1949). Recent Wall Street Journal materials say that the profits obtained by 321 American consortia in the second quarter of this year exceeded the profits obtained in the same period last year by 46 percent. It is for this reason that American large capitalists are enthusiastic about war.

(III) Scorn the United States, because it is a paper tiger and can be completely defeated.

1.  The United States is politically isolated. Because the United States launches aggression everywhere, the people of the world who love peace and freedom oppose it. The 475 million people of China resolutely oppose it, the 200 million people of the Soviet Union resolutely oppose it, the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania, Mongolia, and other people's democratic countries resolutely oppose it, the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries such as Malaya, the Philippines, Indonesia, Burma, and India resolutely oppose it, and the awakened people in capitalist countries such as France, Italy, Britain, and the United States also resolutely oppose it. More than 500 million people in countries around the world have signed petitions against war and demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons. These signatures against aggressive war also include the people of capitalist countries such as the United States, Britain, and France. There are also contradictions and differences between various imperialist countries, which will of course add many difficulties to the United States, which is actively expanding its aggression.

2.  The military weaknesses of the United States are:

    (A) The battle line is too long. If the United States launches a third world war, its battle line will inevitably stretch from Western Europe to East Asia, spanning more than 20,000 li. Such a long battle line has never been seen in the history of world warfare and is easily breached. In the past, the longest battle line for Japan in the Far East and for Germany in Europe and Africa was only about 10,000 li. Fighting on such a long battle line will inevitably lead to extreme dispersion of forces, making it difficult to take care of both ends.

    (B) The rear is too far away. The American army must cross the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to fight in distant foreign countries, which makes it extremely difficult to reinforce troops and supply materials, and the cost of transportation is also huge. The United States is nearly 20,000 li away from both Western Europe and East Asia. The deeper its invading army goes, the farther it is from the rear. In the past, when Hitler launched an invasion against the Soviet Union and Japan launched an invasion against China, their rear was only five or six thousand li at the farthest. Even when Hitler launched an offensive against Africa and Japan launched an offensive against the South Sea Islands, their rear was only about 10,000 li away. The United States' invasion of Korea this time has encountered great difficulties in supply and transportation because it is too far from the rear. According to the American News Service, logistics experts from the American Department of Defense described the difficulties of supplying the American forces invading Korea, saying: "Everything needed by the troops in Korea—from guns, water purification equipment, to bridge decking for repairing bridges—must be transported from outside. Most of it must cross the Pacific Ocean, a journey of 5,000 miles (equivalent to about 16,000 Chinese li). This means that it takes at least a month and a half from the time a unit is ordered to pack up and depart from a base in the United States until the unit completes unloading at a port in Korea. Each soldier sent to Korea must be equipped with seven cubic tons of equipment, and at least one ton of equipment must be supplied to him each month thereafter, not including the reserves stored in preparation for the attack. In terms of distance, the sea voyage from Seattle to Busan, Korea, is 4,649 miles (equivalent to more than 14,800 Chinese li). It takes a Liberty ship 19 and a half days and a ship with a speed of 15 nautical miles per hour 13 days." It can be seen that the remoteness of the rear greatly limits the maneuverability of American troop supply.

    (C) Insufficient troops, low morale, and not much practical experience. The existing army, navy, and air force of the United States total 1,458,000 people, but two-thirds of them are non-combat personnel. The American ground forces now have only eleven regular divisions and two marine corps divisions, as well as some auxiliary forces. Although the United States has already used all its forces in the Far East, emptied its domestic reserves, and mobilized the forces of its vassal states in order to invade a young North Korea with a population of about 10 million, it still feels that the forces are insufficient. If it invades the whole world, the forces will of course feel even more insufficient. Although the United States is greatly expanding its military, this is always limited and it is difficult to completely overcome the difficulty of insufficient forces. It is estimated that the maximum number of troops that the United States and its Western European vassal states can mobilize is no more than 40 million, while the number of troops that the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries can mobilize can reach more than 80 million, a difference of one time. The experience in the Second World War proves that the United States' mobilization capability is not as good as that of Germany. At that time, the United States mobilized a maximum of 11 million people, while Germany mobilized 17 million people. According to an article published in the American Staff College Military Magazine in March of this year, in order to launch an anti-Soviet war in Europe, 90 divisions of troops would be needed in the first six weeks, but the current strength of all Atlantic Treaty countries, including the United States and Britain, in Europe can only produce 30 to 35 divisions in the first six weeks. Even after three to five years of organization and training, the eight countries of Europe can only form 60 divisions. It can be seen that the United States cannot completely overcome the difficulty of its insufficient forces. American soldiers have low morale because they do not know why they are fighting. The combat effectiveness of the American army is not as good as that of the Japanese army and the German army, which was proven in the Second World War. The United States joined both world wars very late, sent fewer troops, and did not experience many large battles, so it lacks practical war experience.

    (D) Allies are not strong. The former military powers Germany and Japan were defeated in World War II. Although the United States wants to rearm them, it has not yet been able to arm them. Britain, France, and Italy have suffered great damage in World War II and are no longer military powers. In this way, the United States lacks strong assistants in its aggressive war.

    (E) Although the United States has established military bases all over the world, it still lacks strong and reliable military bases in the Far East and Western Europe that can be used as the main forward bases. The United States initially intended to use Britain and France as such military bases, but this plan failed due to the resolute resistance of the people of Britain and France. Now the United States intends to turn Japan and Germany into such military bases, but this plan is also encountering resistance from the people of Germany and Japan, so this plan is not easy to implement. Before launching an invasion against the whole of China, Japan first occupied Korea and Manchuria and turned these two places into invasion bases. Before launching an invasion against the Soviet Union, Germany also first occupied Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Poland and turned these places into its invasion bases. But now it is extremely difficult for the United States to complete the plan to establish strong bases before it launches a world war.

The above military weaknesses put the United States in a more unfavorable situation in a future aggressive war than Germany and Japan were in during World War II.

3.  Although the United States has an advantage in resources, with relatively high production of steel, iron, coal, and oil, this advantage will be limited and offset by its various military weaknesses. For example, long-distance transportation causes its coal and gasoline to be greatly consumed. Because transportation is time-consuming, it is naturally difficult to replenish materials in time. Moreover, this advantage can only be temporary. Once the United States launches a world war, Western Europe may be liberated quickly. At that time, the comparison of resources will change and the United States will lose its significant advantage. Taking steel production as an example, in 1949, the United States produced more than 70.6 million tons of steel. The five major steel-producing countries in Western Europe—Britain, France (including the Saar region of West Germany), Belgium, Luxembourg, and Italy—produced a total of more than 33 million tons of steel. The combined annual steel production of the eight countries of the Soviet Union, China, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and the German Democratic Republic is approximately 34 million tons. After the liberation of Europe, the annual steel production of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries plus Western Europe could reach more than 67 million tons, approaching a balance with the steel production of the United States. Moreover, due to the superiority of the social system of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, the mobilization capacity for military production is greater. For example, in the Second World War, the Soviet Union produced not only more tanks and artillery than Germany, but also more than the United States. From 1941 to 1944, the average annual production of tanks in the Soviet Union was 30,000, and the average annual production of artillery and mortars was 220,000. In 1944, the production of medium and light tanks in the United States was only more than 17,500, and the production of heavy artillery, tank guns, mortars, and howitzers was 48,100. It can be seen that the ratio of steel production cannot completely determine the ratio of weapon production.

4.  The United States is doing its best to tout the atomic bomb in order to threaten the people of various countries. The atomic bomb is of course a cruel weapon that should be banned, but its role in military terms is only large-scale bombing (according to experts, an atomic bomb is roughly equivalent to 2,000 or 3,000 tons of ordinary bombs) and cannot determine the outcome of a war. Britain and the United States dropped 1.35 million tons of bombs on Germany in World War II (equivalent to 450 to 675 atomic bombs), but this did not cause Germany to fail. In the end, it was the Soviet army that defeated Germany. Moreover, the atomic bomb also has many shortcomings in military terms: First, it takes time to manufacture and is expensive, so it cannot be manufactured in large quantities. According to American military commentator Baldwin's estimate in September 1949, the United States manufactured only a few hundred atomic bombs in more than four years. Nearly 5 billion US dollars has been spent to manufacture atomic bombs. Second, because of its great destructive power, it cannot be used on the battlefield to directly destroy the enemy's combat power in order to avoid the mutual destruction of one's own troops. Third, it can only bomb large and concentrated targets (such as large military-industrial cities and large concentrated troops, etc.). Therefore, the larger the land area and the more dispersed the population, the smaller the effectiveness of the atomic bomb.

The atomic bomb is now no longer exclusive to the United States. The Soviet Union also has the atomic bomb. If the United States dares to drop an atomic bomb, it should naturally be retaliated against. American industry is concentrated, so the atomic bomb is the most terrible thing for the United States. This is something that American warmongers cannot but seriously consider.

Based on the above situation, it can be seen that if American imperialism dares to risk launching a third world war, the world peace and democracy camp, led by the powerful Soviet Union, is fully capable of defeating it. China and the Soviet Union have formed an alliance. The two countries have a total of 700 million people, plus other people's democratic countries, there are a total of 830 million people. The Soviet Union and China both have vast territories and abundant resources. The people of both countries are united. They have both undergone long-term revolution

　　怎样认识美国
    （宣传提纲）
    中国的工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级和一切爱国的人民都必须正确地认识美国。
    过去有些中国人上了美国帝国主义的当，认为中国需要依赖美国，应当把美国当作好朋友，也有人以为美国是个很文明、很民主的国家，中国应该向美国学习，还有人以为美国的力量真是强得很，谁也惹它不起。
    事实上，亲美的主张是反动的，崇美、恐美的想法也都是错误的。
    在充分了解了关于美国的真相后，每一个爱国的中国人都应当仇视美国、鄙视美国、蔑视美国！
    （一）仇视美国，因为它是中国人民的死敌。
    目前，美国已在公开侵略我国，并且准备对我国实行进一步的侵略：
    １、美国发动了侵略朝鲜的战争以后，即公开侵占我国的领土台湾。大批的美国军舰、飞机已驻扎到台湾，麦克阿瑟已公开宣布要把台湾变作美国的军事基地。美国的目的就是要使台湾成为侵略中国大陆的跳板。
    ２、美国在朝鲜的侵略日益扩大，美国政府已不顾我国的警告，让美国侵略军越过三八线，逼近我国东北边境。美国在朝鲜的侵略已威胁到我国的安全。美国的计划就是在完全侵占朝鲜以后，进一步侵略我国。一九四八年四月李承晚向美国政府所提出的“韩美同盟条约”草案第一条即说：“双方承认并成立谅解：如果解放战争（按指美国的侵略战争）一定要在满洲领土上继续进行，以答复中国共产党对朝鲜的侵略，美利坚合众国总统阁下将帮助大韩民国总统阁下把解放战争进行到胜利的结束。”法新社华盛顿十月四日电也说：“若干美国舆论也极力主张美国军队必须越过朝鲜北部，进入目前为中国共产党军队所占领的满洲。”美国现在所走的就是过去日本所走过的老路，日本也是先侵略朝鲜及台湾，再由朝鲜而东北，而华北，而全中国。
    ３、美国的飞机和军舰不断向我国挑衅。美国飞机曾于八月二十七日、二十九日、九月二十二日、十月十三日、十四日、十五日、十六日、二十日、二十一日、二十二日、二十四日、二十五日连续侵入我国东北境内侦察、轰炸、扫射。十月七日和十四日，美国飞机又在我山东沿海地区侦察扫射。九月二十日，美国军舰在山东的成山角附近我国领海内炮轰并非法盘查我国商船。美国这一连串的挑衅行动证明美国已决心扩大侵略。
    ４、美国仍在援助蒋介石匪帮进行挣扎，美国的军火武器及其他物资不断运往台湾，美国的军官正在训练残余的国民党军队。据不完全材料，自今年一月以来，美国和加拿大给蒋匪的飞机已达数百架，坦克也有数百辆。
    ５、美国不让我国参加联合国和盟国对日委员会，而硬让我国人民公敌台湾国民党匪帮非法占据着我国席位。我国外交部周恩来部长自今年一月以来曾历次要求联合国开除非法的国民党匪帮代表，接纳中华人民共和国的代表，苏联在联合国大会和安理会中也不断提出同样的建议，但这些合理的要求和建议都被美国和其指挥下的附庸国家所否决。
    ６、美国正积极扶植和武装日本。日本法西斯势力正在复活，许多日本侵华战犯已被麦克阿瑟释放，日本的陆军正在“警察后备队”的名义下重建，日本警察部队现已有十二万五千名，麦克阿瑟总部民政局长惠特奈今年年初曾向吉田政府提出一项秘密备忘录，计划把日本武装部队扩充为五十万人，这一计划已在实行中。日本的海军也在恢复中，所谓“海上保安厅”，现已拥有舰艇三百艘。美国的目的是想利用日本作为美国在远东发动侵略的先锋。美国现正打算撇开中国和苏联单独和日本讲和。美国这样作的目的，就是为了便于公开扶植日本侵略势力复活。
    ７、美国已在太平洋上建立起一个庞大的军事基地网，这一基地网，自阿拉斯加的美军基地开始，经阿留申群岛、日本、琉球、朝鲜、台湾、菲律宾、婆罗洲、苏门答腊、越南，一直伸展到泰国、缅甸以至印度。可以看出，这一基地网是对新中国采取包围的形势。麦克阿瑟曾公开承认这一基地网是以中国和苏联为目标。为了在外交上、军事上、经济上共同包围和压迫中国，美国已经命令英国、法国、澳大利亚、日本、菲律宾、泰国以及旁的一些国家采取同一步骤，这些国家对于我国和我国侨民的利益现在愈来愈加敌视了。
    ８、美国除对我国进行公开侵略外，并企图从内部来破坏我国。美国的特务机关正和国民党的特务机关勾结在一起，指挥特务匪徒在我国内部进行各种破坏活动。美国已在新中国的周围建立起从朝鲜到印度的间谍网，香港、曼谷等地都已成为美蒋对我国进行特务活动的据点，东京和台湾则是它们的指挥中心。美国在台湾、日本、菲律宾和朝鲜等地都开办了间谍学校，大批训练特务人员，这些特务分子在毕业后就被派入中国大陆活动。据西南统计，西南各省主要土匪帮头子有百分之六十是受过美蒋特务训练的。
    以上是说目前。再从历史上看，美国也是一贯侵略我国的。主要的事实可举出以下几项：
    １、和英国一样，美国也是最早运鸦片到中国来的鸦片贩子。一八三九年，林则徐在广州查禁的鸦片，很大一部分是出自美国人手中。鸦片战争中，美国海军统领基尔尼亲率舰队到中国海面声援英军。一八四四年七月又强迫满清政府与美国签订了望厦条约，最先创立了“治外法权”与“利益均沾”条款。所谓“治外法权”，就是美国人在中国犯罪可以不受中国法律的制裁。所谓“利益均沾”，就是美国要与其他各国分沾侵略中国的利益。望厦条约是满清政府与外国政府最早签订的不平等条约之一。
    ２、在一八五七到一八六○年英法联军侵略我国，进兵天津和北京时，美国军舰也参加行动，并乘机胁迫满清政府订立中美天津条约（一八五八年），取得在限制中国关税、中国内河航行及自由传教等项侵略权利。
    ３、一八六二年，美国驻上海总领事指示美人华尔等与英人共同组织军队，帮助满清政府镇压太平天国革命运动。
    ４、一八七二年美国军队进攻朝鲜，一八七三年又与日本联合进攻台湾，同年美国军队进攻朝鲜，一八七四年又与日本军队联合进攻朝鲜。
    ５、一九○○年美国参加八国联军进攻中国，并在辛丑和约中和其他帝国主义共同取得在北京等地驻兵的侵略权利。
    ６、一九一七年九月美国务卿蓝辛与日本外相石井订立协定，承认日本在华侵略利益，一九一八年又在巴黎和会中承认日本继承德国在山东的侵略权利。
    ７、一九二二年至一九二四年以军火及贷款援助直系军阀曹锟、吴佩孚等进行内战。
    ８、一九二五年五卅惨案中参加屠杀中国人民。
    ９、一九二七年四月，为了压迫中国大革命，特别是为了压迫蒋介石投降帝国主义，与英国联合炮击南京，造成下关惨案。
    １０、一九三一年至一九三三年以贷款（其中一次为五千万美元）、飞机和军事顾问援助蒋介石进攻中国共产党所领导的工农红军。
    １１、在日本侵华期间以大量军事物资供给日本。据日本官方材料，一九三七年美国输入日本的军需物资占日本全部进口军需物资的百分之三十三点五，一九四○年三月更增为百分之三十八点七，美国输日的废铁至一九四一年底还占日本废铁输入总数的百分之七十。
    １２、在日本投降以后，积极侵略中国，企图代替日本统治中国，将中国变作美国的殖民地。一九四六年十一月四日与蒋介石订立了有名的侵略条约“中美友好通商航海条约”，攫取中国的经济主权、关税主权及沿海和内河航行权等。这一条约实际上是一个新的“二十一条”。甚至英国议员都称之为是对中国“从未见过的最野蛮的经济侵略”。
    １３、在日本投降以后，以金钱、军火武器、物资及军事顾问帮助蒋介石发动大规模的反人民内战。从日本投降至一九四八年六月，据已知材料，美国给蒋介石的各项援助达四十三亿四千六百多万美元。抗战中美国曾给蒋介石以十五亿六千七百多万美元的援助，这些援助的绝大部分也被蒋介石留作在抗战结束后发动内战的资本。两项合计为五十九亿一千六百多万美元，这就是美国对蒋介石的反人民内战所作的巨大投资。
    （二）鄙视美国，因为它是腐朽的帝国主义国家，是全世界反动堕落的大本营。
    １、美国现在被少数的大资本家统治着，美国政府就是他们手中的工具，美国总统杜鲁门就是美国大资本家的忠实走狗。美国大资本家有一个联合组织，叫做“全国制造商协会”，它拥有大约一万六千个庞大的企业，控制着约六百亿美元资本。协会的领导机构即“十二人委员会”，是由美国最大的几个资本家摩根、洛克菲勒、梅隆、杜邦等财团的代表组成的。美国大资本家主要的就是经过这一组织去确定美国政府的政策，美国政府所施行的对内对外政策，都是从该协会发出或者是和它取得协议的。该协会自己出版的小册子也说，全国制造商协会的领导机关“每天都保持着与国会领袖们、各部各局的领导者们的联系，为自己的会员们收集情报，并把工业集团对当前问题的观点告知有关的管理机关（指美国政府机关）。”美国政府的首脑人物如国务卿艾奇逊、国家安全资源局主席薛明顿、杜鲁门特别助理顾问哈里曼、国务院负责对日和约谈判的外交政策顾问杜勒斯、美国驻联合国常任代表奥斯汀、美国驻西德高级专员麦克洛埃等，都是该协会派到杜鲁门政府中去的。艾奇逊是美国著名的法律事务所“科文顿、达林格、艾奇逊公司”的主人，这个公司是服务于摩根、洛克菲勒和杜邦财团的。哈里曼是美国最大的富翁之一，是“布朗克兄弟、哈里曼银行公司”的经理。薛明顿在大战期间是“爱默逊电气公司”的经理。麦克洛埃是洛克菲勒“大通银行”的顾问。据贝克尔所著“美帝国主义及马歇尔计划”一书的材料，只是一九四八年初杜鲁门所任命的在美国政府中担任领导地位的，即有银行家财政家及工业家五十人。美国大资本家就是通过这些代理人，控制着美国政府的每一举动。美国的执政党民主党和共和党都在大资本家直接控制下，两党的主要负责人很多本身就是大资本家或是与大资本家有联系的人。例如，民主党全国委员会主席，有一个时期曾是莱斯科布，他是“杜邦公司”及“通用汽车公司”的董事之一。与摩根有联系的维尔。海斯和费城的大工业家斯考特曾是共和党的领导者。美国国会也为大资本家直接控制着，据苏联《消息报》材料，现在的美国国会中有六十八个大制造商，十三个银行家和三百多个在大公司及银行中服务的法律家。
    ２、美国的对内政策就是压迫和剥削人民，绞杀民主，绞杀文化的政策：
    （甲）美国大资本家掌握着全国绝大部分的财富，他们控制着全国的经济生活，而广大人民则过着极端贫苦的生活。据统计，美国二百个最大的公司在一九三三年控制了全国财富的百分之十九至二十一，控制了全国工业财富百分之四六至五一，一切公司（金融除外）的物质资产的百分之六十。在一九四七年，资产在十亿美元以上的大公司（包括金融的与非金融的）就有四十五家，其所控制资产共达一千零三十四万万五千万美元。据苏联库克辛斯基著的一本叙述美国劳工情况的书指出：在一九四○年至一九四六年的七年间，美国各大公司的净利，总计为六百六十五亿美元，这个数目超过了一九三八年美国的全部国民收入。但广大美国人民的生活情形是怎样呢？据“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”第六十八期指出：在第二次世界大战前夕，占美国人口约百分之八十的劳动人民，只获得国民收入的百分之四十四点四。据美国人口调查局最近公布的报告称：在一九四八年，百分之五十以上的美国家庭收入不够维持最低生活；自一九四八年以来，百分之五十七以上的美国家庭的收入不够维持最低生活。美国全失业者和半失业者已达一千八百万。美国有千万以上的人没有房屋住，另有四千多万人住着肮脏狭小的贫民窟。据美国“家庭服务社”的材料，在美国最大的城市纽约，大约有二十六万个家庭是没有房屋的，另有五十万个家庭是住在贫民窟里的。这些就是美国宣传机关极力吹嘘的“美国生活方式”的真正内容。
    （乙）美国的所谓“民主”，完全是虚伪的，“民主”权利只归有钱人享受，而广大人民的民主权利则已被剥夺干净。美国的选举制度只是骗人的把戏，选民权利受着六十多种限制，其中包括财产、种族、居住等项限制。在一九四八年的总统与国会的选举中曾有三分之一的选民被剥夺掉选举权利。在美国的全部人口中，产业工人占百分之五十，国会中却没有一个工人代表。人民不但没有选举自由，而且也没有言论出版集会结社自由。像蒋介石的统治一样，特务机关控制一切。司法部的联邦调查局是一个规模庞大的特务机关，该局有一万四千多名便衣侦探，担负迫害人民的专门任务。他们曾对二百万公务人员进行思想、生活和行动的侦察，并强迫他们履行所谓“忠诚宣誓”。由于种族歧视，黑人更遭受极残酷的压迫，他们不能与白人一起上学、走路、坐车，并且常任意被侮辱和杀死。美国统治阶级用尽一切办法来压迫共产党。美国共产党总书记丹尼斯及其他十一个共产党领袖已受到美国当局无理的审讯，丹尼斯且已被关入监狱。众议院的“非美活动委员会”是专门迫害共产党和一切进步人民的。最近国会又通过了一个所谓“反颠覆法案”（又叫麦卡伦法案），打算利用这个法案进一步迫害共产党和一切进步势力。“三Ｋ党”“美国军团”“美国至上委员会”“银衫团”等法西斯恐怖组织的活动也日益猖獗。这许多事实说明美国已成为法西斯反动的大本营。
    （丙）由于资产阶级统治压迫的结果，美国的文化已完全腐化堕落。美国的出版业和新闻业几乎全部控制在少数大资本家的手里。《一千个美国人》一书的作者赛德斯说：“百分之九十九的报纸和杂志是属于大资本家的，它们和十二家大公司、大富豪建立的制度一致。”全国出版人协会、全国报纸发行人协会与全国制造家协会实际上是同胞兄弟，它们都是大资本家的办事机关。在独占资本家的控制下，所有的报纸、杂志及其他出版物都成为鼓动战争和反对民主的工具。科学和艺术同样为独占资本家紧紧控制。他们迫使这些东西为帝国主义侵略服务。科学不用于建设而用于战争，科学家都忙于制造原子弹、细菌武器等灭绝人性的杀人武器。艺术不提倡进步而提倡堕落，大部分的美国文学、电影、戏剧、美术所宣传的都是腐化、堕落、拜金主义、诲淫诲盗、神奇怪诞以及战争狂一类的东西。美国大资本家的企图，就是以这些有毒的东西，毒害年青一代的心灵，腐蚀他们的道德观念，使他们的精神颓废，智力的发展停滞，以便好驱使他们为侵略和战争服务。
    ３、美国的对外政策就是侵略政策和战争政策：
    （甲）美国的侵略及于五大洲。它进行侵略扩张的方式主要有以下几种：
    （１）直接发动武装侵略，例如最近对朝鲜和对中国领土台湾的侵略。
    （２）帮助其他帝国主义国家侵略，例如帮助英国侵略马来亚、帮助法国侵略越南。
    （３）援助许多殖民地或半殖民地国家的反动派进行反人民内战。例如过去支持蒋介石进攻中国人民、支持希腊保皇法西斯政府进攻希腊人民，现在支持菲律宾的季里诺傀儡政府进攻菲律宾人民等。
    （４）扶持各国反动派，镇压各国民主势力。例如扶植日本和德国法西斯势力复活，镇压日本和德国的民主势力，支持西班牙佛朗哥法西斯政府，企图让它加入联合国，指使澳大利亚、玻利维亚、委内瑞拉、巴拿马等国政府宣布共产党非法，指使英、法、意、西德、加拿大、日本等国政府压迫共产党等。
    （５）利用经济援助控制其他资本主义国家。例如利用马歇尔援欧计划控制英国、法国、意大利、比利时、挪威、丹麦、荷兰、土耳其、卢森堡、葡萄牙、印尼、瑞典等国的经济和政治，促使这些国家的政府法西斯化，并强迫他们进行战争准备。
    （乙）美国正在积极准备和鼓吹第三次世界大战：
    （１）美国已在世界上建立起无数军事基地，朝鲜、日本、菲律宾、印度、越南、土耳其、希腊、法国、英国、西德、丹麦、挪威、冰岛等地都已有了美国的海空基地。
    （２）美国正在大肆扩军，军费不断增加。杜鲁门已经宣布要把陆海空军兵员在最短期间由一百五十万人增至三百万人。美国一九五○——五一年度的经常军费拨款原有一百五十余亿美元，美国会又于九月间通过杜鲁门所提出的一九五○——一九五一年度的追加预算一百五十余亿美元。此外，美国并在强迫西欧各国扩军。
    （３）叫嚣原子弹，并顽固地拒绝苏联在联合国大会上所提出的禁止原子武器和裁军三分之一的方案。
    （４）积极武装西德、日本，企图让它们作美国的侵略先锋。九月中旬英美法三国外长会议已通过一个武装西德的决定。
    （５）领头签订了大西洋公约、泛美公约等准备战争的公约。此外，并在酝酿签订太平洋公约，企图以它来网罗远东各国反动派力量进行战争准备，反对中华人民共和国。
    （６）破坏联合国安全理事会的五强一致的原则，企图进一步把联合国变作侵略工具。
    （７）疯狂进行战争宣传。美国海军部长马休斯在八月二十五日演说中公开宣布“不惜任何代价，甚至发动战争的代价，来强迫实现和平合作”，并说不怕“因此得到侵略战争发动者的称号”。十月二十四日杜鲁门在他的演说中公开宣布“美国现在所坚决遵从的”而且将“继续奉行”的“唯一方针”就是“增加其武装力量的方针”，并要联合国“必须准备使用武力”。
    （丙）侵略和战争的政策是符合于美国大资本家的利益的，因为这不但可为他们夺得殖民地，而且还可使他们从军事定货中获得巨大利润。据苏联消息报材料，美国工业集团在第二次世界大战中所获得的纯利的总数目在五百三十亿美元以上。在一九四二年，有五个股份公司的总利润超过一九三六至一九三九年平均利润的一百倍以上。据美国通讯社合众社公布的材料证明，由于杜鲁门的备战政策，五十六个工业集团的资产总值，在两年之中（从一九四七至一九四九年），自一千零三十五亿美元扩大到一千三百五十亿美元。最近华尔街日报的材料说，美国三百二十一个财团在今年第二季中所获得的利润比去年同时期所获得利润超过了百分之四十六。正是由于这个缘故，美国的大资本家才热中于战争。
    （三）蔑视美国，因为它是纸老虎，是完全可以打败的。
    １、美国在政治上是孤立的。美国因为到处发动侵略，所以全世界爱好和平自由的人民都反对它。中国四亿七千五百万人民坚决反对它，苏联二亿人民坚决反对它，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国、波兰、捷克、德意志民主共和国、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、蒙古等人民民主国家的人民坚决反对它，马来亚、菲律宾、印尼、缅甸、印度等殖民地半殖民地国家的人民坚决反对它，法、意、英等资本主义国家及美国内部的觉悟的人民也坚决反对它。全世界各国已有五亿多人民签名反对战争，要求禁止原子武器。这些签名反对侵略战争的，也包括了美国及英法等资本主义国家的人民。各帝国主义国家相互间也是有矛盾有分歧的，这当然也会给积极扩大侵略的美国增加很多困难。
    ２、美国在军事上的弱点是：
    （甲）战线太长。美国如果发动第三次世界大战，它的作战线势必从西欧一直拉到东亚，绵长二万多里，这样长的战线是世界作战史上所没有过的，是很容易被突破的。过去日本在远东的作战线，德国在欧洲及非洲的作战线最长也不过一万里左右。在这样长的战线上作战，兵力势必极端分散，首尾很难相顾。
    （乙）后方太远。美国军队必须横渡大西洋和太平洋到辽远的国外去作战，这样就使得兵力的增援和物资的供应极为困难，运输的消耗也很巨大。美国无论距西欧距东亚都是近两万里的路程，它的侵略军愈是深入，就愈是距离后方远。过去希特勒向苏联发动侵略，日本向中国发动侵略时，它们的后方最远时也不过相距五六千里，即使希特勒在向非洲进攻，日本向南洋群岛进攻时，它们的后方相距也不过一万里左右。美国这次侵略朝鲜，因为距离后方太远，所以就遇到补给运输上的极大困难。据美国新闻处消息，美国国防部的后勤专家曾经叙述侵朝美军补给的困难情形说：“在朝鲜部队所需要的一切东西——从枪炮、滤水设备、到修复桥梁的铺板——几乎都要从外面运来。其中大部分须横跨太平洋，历程五千英里（合中国里约一万六千里）。这就是说，一个部队从在美国国内基地奉令整装出发起，到这个部队在朝鲜的港口完成卸陆为止，至少整整需要一个半月的时间。每个派赴朝鲜的兵士，随身必须配有七个容积吨的装备，此后每月至少要供给他装备一吨，这还不包括准备进攻的储备囤存在内。从距离来说，自西雅图到朝鲜的釜山海程是四六四九英里（合中国里一万四千八百多里），自由轮需时十九日半，每小时速率十五海英里的船只需时十三日。”可见后方的遥远是大大限制了美国兵力补给的机动性。
    （丙）兵力不足，士气不高，实战经验不多。美国现有的陆海空军共为一百四十五万八千余人，但其中三分之二是非战斗人员。美国地面部队现在只有十一个正规师及二师海军陆战队，此外还有一些辅助部队。美国为了侵略一个年青的约一千万人口的北朝鲜，虽然已经把在远东的兵力全部用上，把国内的后备兵力调空，并动员了它的附庸国的兵力，但还是感到兵力不足。如果它向全世界侵略，兵力当然更感不足。美国虽然正在大肆扩军，但这总是有限度的，很难完全克服兵力不足的困难。据估计，美国及其西欧附庸国家兵力动员额最高不过四千万人，而苏联及各人民民主国家的兵力动员额则可达八千多万人，两者相差一倍。第二次世界大战中的经验证明，美国的动员能力还不如德国，当时美国最高时动员了一千一百万人，而德国却动员了一千七百万人。据今年三月美国参谋学院军事杂志发表的一篇文章估计，为了在欧洲发动反苏战争，在开始的六个星期内就需要九十个师的兵力，但目前所有大西洋公约国家包括美英两国在欧洲的实力，在开始六个星期内只能拿出三十个到三十五个师，欧洲八个国家即使经过三年到五年的组织和训练，也只能组成六十个师。可见美国是无法完全克服它的兵力不足的困难的。美国士兵因为不知为何而战，所以士气不高。美国军队的战斗力不如日本军队和德国军队，这是在第二次世界大战中证明了的。美国在两次世界大战中都是参战很晚，出兵较少，且未经过很多很大的战斗，所以是缺乏实际战争经验的。
    （丁）同盟者不强。以前的军事强国德国和日本在二次世界大战中被打败，美国虽然想把它们重新武装，但还未能武装起来。英、法、意因在二次世界大战中受很大损伤，现在都已不再是军事强国。这样，美国在侵略战争中就缺乏有力的助手。
    （戊）美国虽然已在世界各处设立了军事基地，但在远东和西欧尚缺少可作为主要前进基地的强大可靠的军事基地。美国最初打算把英国和法国作为这样的军事基地，但因英、法人民的坚决反抗，这一计划未能成功。现在美国又打算把日本和德国变作这样的军事基地，但又遭到德日两国人民的反抗，所以这一计划也不容易实现。过去日本在向全中国发动侵略以前，首先侵占了朝鲜和满洲，把这两个地方变作侵略基地。德国在向苏联发动侵略以前，也首先侵占了捷克、奥地利、波兰，把这些地方变作它的侵略基地。但是现在美国要想在它发动世界大战前完成建立强大基地的计划却是极端困难的。
    以上这些军事上的弱点，使美国在未来的侵略战争中处在比德日在二次世界大战中的处境更加不利的情况中。
    ３、美国虽然有资源的优势，钢、铁、煤、油的产量比较多，但这种优势会被它在军事上的各种弱点所限制和抵消。例如长距离的运输，就使它的煤和汽油受到很大的消耗。因为运输的费时，物资的补充自然就很难及时。而且这种优势也只能是暂时的，一旦美国发动世界大战，西部欧洲可能很快解放，那时，资源的对比就会发生变化，美国的显著优势就会丧失。拿钢的生产量来说，一九四九年美国钢的产量为七千零六十多万吨，西欧主要产钢国家英、法（包括西德的萨尔区）、比、卢（森堡）、意等五国的产钢量共为三千三百多万吨，苏联、中国、捷克、波兰、保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、德意志民主共和国等八个国家钢的年产量合计约为三千四百多万吨。欧洲解放以后，苏联及人民民主国家加上西欧，钢的年产量就可达六千七百多万吨，与美国的钢产量接近平衡。而且由于苏联及人民民主国家社会制度的优越性，军事生产方面的动员能力较大。例如在第二次世界大战中，苏联的坦克、大炮生产不但多于德国，而且也多于美国，一九四一年至一九四四年苏联坦克的平均年产量为三万辆，大炮及迫击炮的平均年产量为二十二万尊，而一九四四年美国中型及轻型坦克的产量只有一万七千五百多辆，重炮、坦克炮、迫击炮及榴弹炮的产量共为四万八千一百多门。可见钢产量的比例并不能完全决定武器生产的比例。
    ４、美国极力吹嘘原子弹，以此来恐吓各国人民。原子弹当然是一种应当禁止的残忍武器，但它在军事上的作用也只是大规模轰炸而已（据专家估计，一颗原子弹约等于二千吨或三千吨普通炸弹），并不能决定战争的胜败。英美在第二次世界大战中曾向德国投了一百三十五万吨炸弹（等于四百五十枚至六百七十五枚原子弹），但这并未能使德国失败，最后打败德国的还是苏联军队。而且原子弹在军事作用方面也还有很多缺点。即：第一、制造费时，成本昂贵，因此不能大量地制造。据美国军事评论家鲍尔温在一九四九年九月估计，美国在四年多的时间中才不过制造了数百枚原子弹。为了制造原子弹，花费的金钱已将近五十亿美元。第二、由于它的破坏力大，为避免使自己的部队同归于尽，所以不能在作战的阵地上使用，来直接破坏对方的作战力量。第三、它只能轰炸大的和集中的目标（如大的军事工业城市及庞大的集中的部队等）。因此，国土愈是广阔，人口愈是分散的国家，原子弹的效力就愈小。
    原子弹现在已不是美国所独有，苏联也已有了原子弹。如果美国敢于投掷原子弹，它自然应该受到报复。美国工业集中，因此原子弹对于美国反而是最可怕的。这是美国的战争贩子们不能不严重考虑的。
    根据以上的情形可以看出，如果美帝国主义敢于冒险发动第三次世界大战，以强大的苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营是完全有力量打败它的。中苏两大国已经结成同盟，两国共有七万万人口，再加其他人民民主国家，共有八万万三千万人口。苏联和中国都有广阔的国土和丰富的资源，两国人民都是团结一致的，都曾经过长久的革命和战争的锻炼，都有强大英勇的人民军队。过去希特勒和日寇都被苏联和中国所打败，而现在苏联和中国比战胜希特勒和日寇的时候自更强大得多了。美国除了资源比希特勒和日寇较多以外，其他各方面都不如希特勒和日寇。美国如果不自量力，硬挑起第三次世界大战，只会遭到比希特勒和日寇更悲惨的失败。（转载《时事手册》第二期）
