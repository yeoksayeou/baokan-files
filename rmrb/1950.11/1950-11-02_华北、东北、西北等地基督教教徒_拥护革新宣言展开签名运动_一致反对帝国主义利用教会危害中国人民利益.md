　　Christians in North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China
    Support the Reformation Declaration and Launch a Signature Campaign
    Unanimously Opposing Imperialism's Use of Churches to Harm the Interests of the Chinese People
    [This newspaper's report] Christians in North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China have launched a signature campaign to support the Reformation Declaration. The North China Christian Association held an executive committee meeting in early October, deciding to launch a signature campaign to support the Christian Reformation Declaration and gradually implement the self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation of Chinese Christianity. The association has now formed a preparatory committee, with Wang Zizhong and four others responsible. The preparatory committee has printed thousands of copies of promotional materials such as the declaration and lecture booklets, which have been distributed to Christian associations in various cities in North China and other relevant units. The association has also selected Yenching University, Huiwen Middle School, the Congregational Church in Dengshikou, the YMCA and YWCA, and Daoji Hospital in Beijing as key demonstration sites.
    The association has decided that the first phase of the expanded signature campaign will run from October 20th to November 15th.

    Christians in Tianjin began their signature campaign on October 20th. The Tianjin Christian Congregational Church reprinted a large number of Reformation Declarations and distributed them to churches in the city and twenty-two branches in rural areas for study. Pastors in various churches also explain the spirit of the declaration and the significance of signing it during weekly worship services. During the worship service on the 22nd, more than thirty Christians from the Third District Christian Congregational Church in the city signed the declaration on the spot.

    The signature campaign in support of the Reformation Declaration by Christians in Northeast China has been widely launched. As of October 16th, 1,102 people in Shenyang had signed. In early October, the heads of various Christian church units in the Northeast region and Shenyang held a forum, deciding to launch this signature campaign and electing eleven people to form the Preparatory Committee of the Shenyang Christian Association to lead various Christian church units in studying the Reformation Declaration. After studying and discussing the Christian Reformation Declaration and the editorial published in this newspaper, the Christians of the eight Christian churches in Changchun actively promoted it to Christian families. After this study and promotion, elders, pastors, and believers in the city's churches clearly recognized the crimes of imperialism in using Christianity to invade China in the past, and expressed their determination to eliminate the reactionary influence of imperialism in the churches in the future, thoroughly implement the basic principles of self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation in the declaration, and resolutely support the Central People's Government and the Common Program. After launching the promotion of the Reformation Declaration, the fourteen Christian churches in Harbin have had 1,235 people sign the declaration. Many pastors in the city have enthusiastically explained the significance of signing, and cited specific facts such as past imperialist missionaries bullying Chinese people and deceiving Chinese believers in their promotion, which greatly stimulated the patriotic enthusiasm of the Christians.

    The Xinjiang Chinese Christian Church, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Gansu Chinese Christian Church, Christian figures in Xining City, Qinghai, and twenty-five organizations including the Xi'an YMCA, Anglican Church, Baptist Church, and United Church have successively responded to the declaration "The Efforts of Chinese Christianity in the Construction of New China," and held meetings to unanimously oppose imperialism's use of churches to engage in activities that harm the interests of the Chinese people. The statements declared: resolutely carry out the self-governance, self-support, and self-propagation movement.
