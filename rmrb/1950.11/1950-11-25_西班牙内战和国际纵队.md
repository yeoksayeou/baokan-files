　　The Spanish Civil War and the International Brigades
　　(Question) What was the course of the Spanish Civil War from 1936 to 1939? What was the International Brigade organization all about?
　　Central Cooperative Bureau Wang Zhenwu
　　(Answer) The Spanish Civil War of 1936-1939 was caused by the armed rebellion of the Franco fascist bandits. This war was a decisive link in the preparation of the German and Italian fascists for World War II.
　　In February 1936, the Spanish Popular Front (composed of the Spanish Communist Party, the Socialist Party, anarchists and other democratic parties and people's organizations) won the parliamentary elections, defeating the joint offensive of the royal family, warlords, reactionary Catholic groups and feudal landlords. This victory was hailed by progressive mankind all over the world, but the Italian Mussolini bandit gang, which was then invading Abyssinia, and the German Hitler bandit gang, which was stepping up its expansion and aggression in Central Europe, coveted Spain's rich strategic raw materials (Basque iron, Rio Tinto copper, world-famous mercury, Linares lead, Santander zinc and tin, etc.) and Spain's strategic position (the throat of the Mediterranean, the transportation hub of Europe and Africa). They believed that "Spain is a giant on Hitler's chessboard." (Ibarruri) Hitler said sarcastically in Nuremberg in 1936: "We should not ignore the Spanish question. We will assist the Spanish Nationalists (i.e., the Franco bandits) in their struggle until victory." They believed that without destroying Spanish democracy, they could not launch a world war.
　　On July 17, 1936, the fascist bandits, headed by Franco, Goded, and Dillano, who were fostered by Hitler and Mussolini, launched an armed rebellion in Spain. Because these reactionary warlords, landlords, and the fascist organizations of the church had carried out long-term preparations for the rebellion, when the turmoil began, it spread almost throughout the country within a day, placing the rebels in a very strong position. However, the broad masses of the Spanish people, under the leadership of the Republican government, fought very bravely to defend democracy and freedom. The rebels in Madrid and Barcelona were put down by government forces on July 20. Workers, peasants and patriots from all over the country joined the army and militia, and gradually developed into a strong force in the bloody battle. Although Franco occupied western Spain in the early stages and approached Madrid, his Moorish soldiers and mercenaries suffered heavy losses under the fierce resistance of the government forces, and their morale was extremely low. They repeatedly attacked Madrid and attempted to cut off its communication with Valencia, but were repulsed. When Franco's situation became very critical, the direct intervention of the German and Italian fascists began. The 40,000 reinforcements sent by Mussolini at one time, the so-called elite "Black Arrow Division," were completely defeated in the battle on the Guadalajara front in early March 1937. The isolated port of Bilbao was not lost until after eighty-one days of fierce attack by the rebels. Under the heroic resistance of the Spanish people, the German and Italian fascists were forced to increase their troops step by step. During the Spanish Civil War, Mussolini sent a total of 82,000 reinforcements, Hitler sent 39,000 reinforcements, 78,000 Moroccan soldiers, and 12,000 troops from other reactionaries. The number of artillery, airplanes, tanks, and ammunition transported by the German and Italian fascists to the Franco rebels was even more incalculable. They had an overwhelming advantage in manpower and military equipment, but they could not easily conquer the Spanish people.
　　At that time, the British and French governments adopted a dishonorable "non-interference policy" toward the Spanish war. They prohibited the sale of arms to the legitimate Spanish government they recognized, they refused to support the heroic struggle of the people at home to support the Spanish people in defending freedom and democracy, and they advocated hypocritical methods such as "surface surveillance" and "international adjustment" to help Hitler strangle Spanish democracy.
　　In October 1936, Stalin revealed the true nature of the Spanish war in his historically significant telegram to the Secretary of the Spanish Communist Party. He said: "...The liberation of Spain from the hands of the fascists is not the matter of the Spanish people themselves, but the common cause of all progressive mankind."
　　Democratic elements and peace-loving people all over the world could not sit idly by as Hitler and Mussolini wielded butcher knives in Spain, especially the people of Europe. They understood that if Hitler turned Spain into a hotbed for a new war, his sword would soon point at them. People from all over the world helped the Spanish people fight against the fascist Franco war with various support actions.
　　Major cities in the Soviet Union held rallies and demonstrations on August 3, 1936, to protest the German and Italian fascist intervention in Spain's internal affairs, and the working people in various places raised funds to help the Spanish people. All members of the Moscow Trade Union donated half a month's salary. The Soviet government issued a statement advocating a strict halt to the German and Italian fascist support for Franco's criminal actions. The American working people donated 100,000 US dollars under the call of the "Labor League." People in various parts of Britain and France have demanded that their governments lift the ban on transporting arms to the Spanish Republic. The British people organized a "Medical Assistance Association" to work on the Spanish battlefield. The French working people held many large demonstrations demanding the transportation of arms to the Spanish Republic. There was also an organization called the "Association of Comrades Supporting the Spanish Republic" in the United States. The Mexican people unanimously supported the Spanish people.
　　People from all over the world not only helped the Spanish people with protests, strikes, rallies, and donations, but also organized volunteer troops to voluntarily participate in the Spanish people's battle against Franco's fascism. On November 8, 1936, this internationalist team first appeared on the battlefield in Madrid, the capital of Spain. Just as the New York Times reporter wrote at the time, the appearance of this army of international unity "made the Spanish militia on the front line even more courageous."
　　According to a report published in the London-based "Tomorrow" monthly, the International Brigades had the following teams: French team, German team, Belgian team, Polish team, Italian team, Hungarian team, British team, Yugoslav team, Bulgarian team, Swiss team, Romanian team, and American team. Volunteer soldiers from various countries arrived in Spain to participate in the war. It is estimated that on September 8, 1936, more than 100 German anti-fascist soldiers arrived in Barcelona to join the Spanish government army, and in early August of the same year, more than 200 volunteer soldiers of the French people set off to participate in the war. On January 6, 1937, more than 100 American volunteer soldiers (most of whom were soldiers who participated in the First World War) set off for Spain to form the later famous "Lincoln Battalion." By the end of 1937, the International Brigades had developed into five major legions, including people of 52 nationalities. Among them, there were also many overseas Chinese who joined the International Brigades to fight. The commander-in-chief of the International Brigades was the famous Canadian General Kleber. He participated in our Chinese "January 28th" Anti-Japanese War.
　　The International Brigades fought with unparalleled courage for the freedom and democracy of Spain, and also for the happiness of all mankind. At that time, the song "Defend Madrid, Defend World Peace" was widely popular in our country, which was the most appropriate explanation for the battle of the International Brigades. In the thirty-two months of the Spanish people's war against the fascist Franco bandits, the International Brigades always fought side by side with the Spanish people, severely hitting the German and Italian fascists' plan to launch a world war. Especially in the battle to defend Madrid, the International Brigades created countless heroic feats that have been passed down to this day and are praised by all peace-loving people.
　　In March 1939, the Franco bandits stepped on the blood of one million Spanish people and reluctantly supported his fascist rule. The Spanish Republic was forced to go underground. In September of the same year, Hitler launched a war to seize world hegemony. However, Hitler and Mussolini, the former masters of Franco, have fallen into a pool of shame, and Franco, the fascist accomplice who pretended to be "neutral" in World War II, has now become a tool for American imperialism to launch a war. They have forgotten how Hitler burned to death in the flames of gasoline when the Soviet army besieged Berlin, and they have forgotten how Mussolini was punished by the people and hanged in the streets of Italy!

　　西班牙内战和国际纵队
    （问）一九三六——一九三九年西班牙内战的经过如何？国际纵队这个组织是怎么回事？
      中央合作局  王振武
    （答）一九三六——一九三九年的西班牙内战起因于佛朗哥法西斯匪帮的武装叛变。这一战争是德意法西斯在第二次世界大战的准备过程中具有决定性的一环。
    一九三六年二月，西班牙人民阵线（由西班牙共产党、社会党、无政府主义者等民主党派人民团体所组成）在议会选举中获得了胜利，击败了皇族、军阀、反动天主教集团及封建地主的联合进攻。这一胜利受到全世界进步人类的欢呼，但是那时正向阿比西尼亚侵略的意大利墨索里尼匪帮，加紧向中部欧洲扩张侵略的德国的希特勒匪帮，却觊觎着西班牙的丰富的战略原料（巴斯克的铁、里奥金托的铜、世界著名的水银、里拿莱斯的铅、桑坦得尔的锌和锡等）和西班牙的战略地位（地中海的咽喉，欧非的交通枢纽）。他们认为“西班牙是希特勒棋盘上的一颗巨子。”（伊巴露丽）希特勒于一九三六年曾在纽伦堡以讽刺的口吻说：“我们不该漠视西班牙问题，我们将援助西班牙国民党分子（即佛朗哥匪帮）斗争，直到胜利为止。”他们认为不毁灭西班牙的民主，就不能发动世界战争。
    一九三六年七月十七日，希特勒、墨索里尼一手扶植的以佛朗哥、哥代特、第兰诺等人为首的法西斯匪帮在西班牙国内发动了武装叛变。由于这些反动的军阀、大地主和教会的法西斯组织进行了长期的叛变准备，当变乱开始时，几乎一日之内即蔓延了几乎全境，使叛军处于很坚强的地位。但是西班牙广大的人民在共和国政府领导下，为了保卫民主与自由战斗得非常英勇。玛德里和巴塞隆那的叛军在七月二十日就被政府军平定。各地的工人、农民和爱国人士纷纷参加军队和民团，在血的战斗中逐渐锻炼成为一支坚强的队伍。佛朗哥虽然在初期曾占领西班牙西部并逼近了玛德里。但是他的摩尔兵和雇佣军在政府军猛烈抵抗下损失惨重，士气异常低落。他们屡次向玛德里进攻，并企图截断她与伐伦西亚的交通，但均被击退。在佛朗哥的处境变得十分危殆的时候，德意法西斯的直接干涉行动便开始了。墨索里尼一次派遣去的四万援军所谓精锐的“黑箭师”，一九三七年三月初间在瓜达拉迦拉前线作战中一败涂地。孤立的比尔波海港经叛军猛攻八十一天才告失陷。在西班牙人民的英勇抵抗下，德意法西斯被迫逐次增兵。西班牙内战期间，墨索里尼共派去援军八万二千人，希特勒派去援军三万九千人，摩洛哥兵七万八千人，其他各个反动派军队一万二千人。德意法西斯运给佛朗哥叛军的大炮飞机坦克及军火更不计其数。他们在兵员及军事装备上占着压倒的优势，但是他们不能轻易地征服西班牙人民。
    当时英法两国政府对西班牙战争却采取了不名誉的“不干涉政策”，他们禁止售卖军火给他们所承认的合法的西班牙政府，他们拒绝国内人民支援西班牙人民维护自由与民主的英勇斗争，他们倡议的“海面监察”、“国际调整”等虚伪的方法帮助希特勒扼杀西班牙的民主。
    斯大林于一九三六年十月在其致西班牙共产党书记的具有重大历史意义的电文里揭发了西班牙战争的真正性质。他说：“……西班牙从法西斯分子手里的解放不是西班牙人民自己的事，而是全体进步人类的共同事业。”
    全世界民主分子、爱好和平的人民，不能坐视希特勒、墨索里尼在西班牙挥动屠刀，特别是欧洲人民，他们明白，如果希特勒将西班牙变作新战争的温床，它的刀锋即将指向他们。世界各国人民以各种各样的支援行动帮助西班牙人民反对法西斯佛朗哥的战争。
    苏联各大城市于一九三六年八月三日举行了集会示威，抗议德意法西斯干涉西班牙内政，各地劳动人民并募集款项，援助西班牙人民。莫斯科工会的全体会员捐助了半月工资。苏联政府发表声明，主张严厉制止德意法西斯支持佛朗哥的罪恶行动。美国劳动人民在“劳动同盟”号召下捐助了十万美金。英国和法国的各地人民纷纷要求他们的政府解除运输军火给西班牙共和国的禁令。英国人民组织了“医药协助会”赴西班牙战场工作。法国劳动人民举行了多次大示威，要求运军火给西班牙共和国。美国国内且有“赞助西班牙共和国同志会”的组织。墨西哥人民全国一致地支援了西班牙人民。
    世界各国人民不仅以抗议、罢工、集会和募捐等方式援助了西班牙人民而且组织了义勇军，志愿地参加西班牙人民反佛朗哥法西斯的战斗行列。一九三六年十一月八日，这一支国际主义的队伍首次出现在西班牙首都玛德里的战场，正如同当时纽约时报记者所写的这一支国际大团结的军队的出现，“使在前线的西班牙民团更加勇气百倍”。
    据在伦敦出版的“明天”月刊上刊载的文章的报道，国际纵队有着下列各队：法国人队，德国人队，比利时人队，波兰人队，意大利人队，匈牙利人队，英国人队，南斯拉夫人队，保加利亚人队，瑞士人队，罗马尼亚人队，美国人队。各国志愿军先后抵达了西班牙参加作战。计一九三六年九月八日，德国的反法西斯军人百余人抵达巴塞隆那参加西班牙政府军，同年八月初法国人民的志愿军二百余人出发参战。一九三七年一月六日，美国志愿军百余人（多为第一次大战的参战军人），出发西班牙，组成后来有名的“林肯大队”。到一九三七年年底，国际纵队发展到五个大联队，包括五十二个国籍的人士。其中也有我国海外侨胞多人加入国际纵队作战。国际纵队的总司令是有名的加拿大克莱伯将军。他曾参加我们中国的“一二八”抗日战争。
    国际纵队以无比的勇敢为西班牙的自由与民主，也是为全人类的幸福而战斗着。当时“保卫玛德里，保卫全世界的和平”的歌声，在我国广泛流行，为国际纵队的战斗作了最恰当的说明。在三十二个月的西班牙人民反法西斯佛朗哥匪帮的战争中，国际纵队始终与西班牙人民并肩作战，严重地打击了德意法西斯发动世界战争的计划。特别在保卫玛德里的战斗中，国际纵队创造了无数可歌可泣的英勇战迹，一直流传到今天，为所有的爱好和平的人民所歌颂。
    一九三九年三月，佛朗哥匪帮踏着一百万西班牙人民的鲜血，勉强地撑住了他的法西斯统治，西班牙共和国被迫转入了地下。同年九月，希特勒即发动了为争取世界霸权的战争。但是，昔日佛朗哥的主子，希特勒与墨索里尼都倒在耻辱的血泊中了，而在第二次世界大战中伪装“中立”的法西斯走卒佛朗哥今天竟又成为美国帝国主义发动战争的工具。他们忘记了希特勒怎样在苏军围攻柏林时焚死在汽油的烈焰里，他们忘记了墨索里尼怎样受到人民的惩罚而悬尸在意大利的街道上！
