　　Moscow—A Poem in My Heart
　　Ding Ling

　　People most like to tell others about the things they like, share the food they love to eat with others, and invite people to appreciate what they think is beautiful. Writers also write about what they have seen, especially to infect and transform people with their thoughts and feelings. Just as when I arrived in the Soviet Union, I wanted to give people what I had learned and felt in the Soviet Union, so that they could have the same understanding and enthusiasm for the Soviet Union as I do. But people are often very cautious, and even reluctant to talk about the things they love most for a while. It is like when he loves someone, he feels that he cannot talk about it casually, he is afraid of being misunderstood, so he is particularly careful. It is also like when we love Chairman Mao, we love him very deeply, we should talk about it, but sometimes we are reluctant to talk about it, fearing that casual talk will appear shallow and damage our sincerity. For example, when a writer discovers a character, a character grows in his mind, he appreciates and loves him, but when he wants to describe him, he has to be more careful than when writing about anyone else. He is afraid of writing him badly, and if it is not yet the time to mature, he will not easily take him out. As for Moscow, no matter how much I have written about it, I still harbor another kind of more cautious, more careful, but also a more firmly lingering emotion towards it. Moscow! I love you, but I don't want to constantly, endlessly talk about you. Because you are too great, you are too rich, you are too ideal, you are too sublime, you are too solemn, you give people too much inspiration! You gave me new feelings, new emotions, new truths, but I am a small person, my wisdom is not enough, my learning is very poor, I am not able to fully understand you. Therefore, I still have many feelings that I only want to keep in my heart to think about and savor, until that day when I think I fully understand you, I will be like a river that has opened its floodgates, pouring out all the worship for you that is pressing on my heart, and I will go to find poetic sentences to sing your praises to mankind!

　　Moscow! I once strolled in your streets in the cold morning wind, I walked around the Kremlin, I stood on the Moscow Bridge, the water had already frozen, and cars slid past me. I stared at the palace within the red walls. I thought of Russian history. Pushkin's poems, Tolstoy's novels. I thought of Peter the Great, and the corrupt Tsarist dynasty, and also of the peasant leader Pugachev. I thought of the October Revolution, and the name of Lenin was tightly attached to my heart. I thought of the person I most respect who now lives in this palace. His hair is already white, but his feelings are so young. He always gives people the hope of the morning glow, he is so kind and amiable, he loves a young and innocent child, and cares for an old man with trembling hands and feet. But he is as firm as Mount Tai, and sees clearly for thousands of miles. He is strict with a reactionary thought, with the stubborn enemy, and with the culprits of mankind, and does not bargain! When I think of this kind old man, and I look up again, the towering ruby five-pointed star above the palace shines with red light and casts it upon my heart, I feel a burst of happiness, I can't help but cheerfully, yet deeply, cry out: "Stalin!"

　　I once mingled in the crowd on your streets, on Red Square, which I do not know how many people it possessed, on a May night, being pulled to dance by your young people. That was the night of May Day. Late at night, after returning from the theater, I quietly walked into the square again. The music had not stopped, and the electric lights shone brighter than during the day. No one could recognize me. I couldn't understand a word. But we don't need to know each other, and we don't need language. I understood that they were so full of confidence, full of joy, full of vigor, they had lofty beliefs, they were down-to-earth and worked hard, I loved them. They also understood that I was one of them, a Muscovite who couldn't speak Russian. They held my arm, I held their arm, we walked in rows, we formed circles. These red-faced young people, their faces dyed red because of drinking and because of happiness, also included bearded men and mothers. They came in groups and went in groups, I walked into this group and walked into that group. We went to the stage to appreciate the choir in long white skirts, and then returned to the square to look up at the statue of Stalin in the foreground. People couldn't recognize me, I couldn't recognize people, but I seemed to have returned to my childhood, as joyful as the children with my companions in the square watching a village opera. Moscow! How much new, broad, and warm emotion you gave people!

　　I also participated in the Red Square parade twice. I saw the world's most orderly, strongest, and bravest Stalin's heroic army, navy, and air force. It showed the strength of the Soviet Union, it showed that world peace was guaranteed, it made people excited! And two million people marched past Stalin, past Lenin's tomb, they cheered, they congratulated, to Stalin, to Lenin! And I, also because of the victory of the Chinese people, because the Chinese people had Chairman Mao, also mingled among many Chinese representatives, also mingled among representatives from dozens of countries, participated in such a solemn meeting, I couldn't express my gratitude, as if it were for myself, as if it were for China, as if it were for my loved ones, and as if it were for humanity, giving rise to much, much gratitude. People will cry when they are overjoyed. Although I didn't cry, I really felt the pain in my eyes. I had to wipe them from time to time, because there was always something blurring my eyes.

　　I had three stays in Moscow, and each time I was more reluctant to leave than the last. But it has been almost a year since I left, and in this year, the impression of Moscow has not faded with the passage of time, but has grown with time. I love Moscow, I miss Moscow, I don't want to talk about it casually, but when I can't help but say a little, I will also feel how foolish I am, why I can't say it clearly, why I can't say what I think clearly. Well, let me talk about it later. I think, if I work hard, then, maybe I can write a decent poem! Moscow! You are a poem in my heart, and I will work hard for the creation of this poem for a long time!

### 莫斯科—我心中的诗

　　莫斯科—我心中的诗
    丁玲
    人最喜欢把自己喜欢的事情告诉人，把自己爱吃的东西分给别人吃，把自己以为美的东西叫人一同欣赏。作家也是把自己所见到的写出来，尤其是要把自己思想感情去感染去改造人。也如同我到了苏联，愿意把我在苏联所学到的，所感受到的东西给人，让人们有我一样对于苏联的了解和热情。但人们常常很慎重的，甚至一时不愿讲出来他最爱的东西。如同他爱一个人，他觉得不能随便讲，他怕别人误解，便特别有所考虑。又如同我们爱毛主席，爱的很深，应该讲出来，有时却也不愿讲，怕随便说了反表现成为一种浅薄，有损于我们的真诚。再比如一个作家发现了一个人物，思想里生长了一个人物，欣赏他爱他，但要描写他时，却不得不比写任何人都小心。他怕把他写坏了，如果不到成熟的时候，他是不轻易把他拿出来的。我对于莫斯科，不管我曾经写了多少，但我总还蕴蓄着另一种更其慎重，更其小心，却又更加对它有一种萦绕的很牢固的情感。莫斯科！我爱你，但我不愿经常地，喋喋不休地去说你。因为你太伟大了，你太丰富了，你太理想了，你太崇高了，你太庄严了，你给人的启示太多了！你给了我新的感觉，新的情感，新的真理，但我是一个渺小的人，我智慧不够，我的学问很差，我不够全部的理解你。因此我还有许多感情，只肯放在心里思索，体味，要到那末一天，我以为把你全懂了，我就会象一个开了闸口的河流，涌出来压在我心上所有的对你的崇拜，我并且要去寻找诗的句子来向人类把你讴歌！
    莫斯科！我曾经在清晨的寒风下，漫步在你的街头，我围绕着克里姆林宫散步，我伫立在莫斯科桥上，水已经结冰了，汽车在我身边滑过。我凝望着红墙内的宫殿。我想起了俄国历史。普希金的诗，托尔斯泰的小说。我想起了彼得大帝，想起了那个腐朽的沙皇的王朝，也想起了那个农民的领袖布加乔夫。我想起了十月革命，列宁这个名字紧紧的贴在我心上。我想起了现在住在这宫里的我所最尊敬的人。他的头发已经白了，他的感情却那样年青。他永远给人民朝霞一般的希望，他是那样的慈蔼可亲，他痛爱一个稚弱天真的孩子，体贴一个手足颤动的老人。可是他坚定如泰山，明瞩千里，他对一个反动的思想，对那顽固的敌人，对人类的罪魁是严厉的，不讲价钱的！当我想到这个亲切的老人的时候，我的眼睛再望上去，那宫殿上面的耸入云霄的红宝石的五星，就耀射着红光投到我心上，我感到一阵幸福，我不禁愉快的，然而却是深沉地叫着：“斯大林！”
    我曾经在五月的夜晚，在不知拥有多少人的你的街头，红场上，混在人群中，被你们那些年青人拉着跳舞。那是五一的夜晚。深夜了，我从剧场回来后又潜然的走入广场中。音乐还没有停止，电灯照得比白天还亮。没有一个人能认识我。我听不懂一句话。但我们不需要认识，也不需要语言。我懂得他们是那末充满了信心，充满了欢乐，充满了朝气，他们有崇高信仰，他们踏实而努力，我爱他们。他们也懂得我是他们中的一个，我是不会说苏联话的莫斯科人。他们挽着我，我挽着他们，我们排排地走，我们牵成圆圈。这些红脸的、因为喝了酒，因为高兴，都把脸染的红红的年青人，也有长胡子的，也有母亲们，他们走了一群又来了一群，我走入这群又走入那群。我们到舞台下去欣赏穿白色长裙的歌咏队，又走回广场，在斯大林巨像前景仰。人认不得我，我认不得人，但我象回复到童年时代，在看社戏的广场上与同伙的孩子们一样的那样欢跃。莫斯科呵！你是多么的给了人以新的广阔的热烈的情绪呵！
    我也曾经两次参与了红场的阅兵典礼。看见了世界最整齐，最坚强，最勇猛的斯大林的英雄的海陆空军。它说明了苏联的强大，它说明了世界和平之有保障，它使人兴奋！而且有两百万的群众从斯大林的面前走过，从列宁的墓前走过，他们欢呼，他们祝贺，向斯大林，向列宁！而我，我也因为中国人民的胜利，因为中国人民有了毛主席，也杂在许多中国代表之中，也杂在几十个国家的代表之中，参加了这样庄严的大会，我说不出的感谢，好象是为自己，好象是为中国，好象是为我的亲爱的人，又好象是为人类生出许多许多的感谢，人到欢喜过度时是会哭起来的。我虽没有哭出来，却实在感到眼眶的疼痛。时时要去揩它，为的常常有东西把眼睛模糊了。
    在莫斯科我有过三次逗留，一次比一次更舍不得离开。然而却已经离别快一年了，在这一年中，莫斯科的印象并不因时间过去而淡薄，却与时间一同生长。我爱莫斯科，我想念莫斯科，我不愿随便说起它，但当我忍不住说了点时，我也会是多么的觉得自己的愚蠢，为什么我不能说得清楚，为什么不能把自己所想的说得明白。那末，让我过一时再说吧。我想，我若努力的话，到那时，也许可以写成一首象样的诗吧！莫斯科！你是我心中的诗，我将长期的为着这诗的创作而努力！
    一九五○年十月
