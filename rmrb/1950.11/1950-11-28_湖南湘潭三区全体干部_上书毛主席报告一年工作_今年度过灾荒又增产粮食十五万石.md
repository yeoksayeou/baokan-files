(Reported by this newspaper) All cadres of the Third District People's Government of Xiangtan County, Hunan Province, reported to Chairman Mao on the work of the entire district over the past year. The original text is as follows: Dear Chairman Mao:

　　As the earth-shaking struggle of peasants to stand up – the land reform movement – is about to begin, we report to you on the work of the past year in your hometown – the Third District of Xiangtan, Hunan.

　　Over the past year, the entire district has been at the forefront of every movement in the autumn grain requisition, anti-hegemony, rent reduction, production movement, and democratic political construction. For example, during last year's autumn grain requisition, all our cadres and the masses completed the 73,000-shi public grain task assigned by the higher party committee in less than three months. Although the crops were largely reduced due to the eight or nine months of guerrilla warfare before liberation last year, and most of the young peasants joined the army, no one, from cadres to the masses, complained. Everyone cheerfully handed in grain, especially in Shaoshan Village, where the entire village over-delivered more than 100 shi of public grain. Starting in the first month of this year, we cleared out bandits and opposed local bullies. The party branch mobilized many young peasants to join the army, established district squadrons and self-defense forces, and mobilized the masses to suppress bandits, eliminating three groups of bandits; we also cracked down on the "Hunan People's Anti-Communist Headquarters" organized by bandits and special agents, seizing 32 long and short guns, two telephones and radios, and capturing, winning over, and disintegrating 70 bandits. Now the masses can sleep without closing their doors. In March, the district launched a rent reduction and deposit refund movement, mobilizing peasants to carry out a sharp struggle against landlords, initially defeating the arrogance of the landlord class; abolishing the puppet Baojia system; establishing 21 village peasant associations, and peasants of all ages and genders joined the peasant associations. In total, the peasants obtained 10,549 shi of rent grain, refunded silver deposits of 25,400 yuan, 21 taels of gold, and cleared 4,100 shi of accumulated grain; these fruits solved the food shortage difficulties of most peasants during the spring and summer famine this year.

　　Due to the long-term plundering by the Chiang Kai-shek and Bai Chongxi bandit gangs, the people were extremely poor, and everyone's enthusiasm for production was extremely low, which was an important reason for this year's spring and summer famine. Through government relief and our mobilization of the masses to engage in production to overcome the famine, the production enthusiasm of all peasants was improved. Last winter, all winter plowing was carried out, and this spring, 2,794 mu of wasteland and 60 mu of paddy fields were reclaimed. Not only did we successfully overcome the disaster, but we also increased grain production. It is estimated that the district's 97,450 mu of fields can increase rice production by about 20,000 shi, and increase sweet potato production by more than 200,000 shi, for a total increase of about 150,000 shi of grain compared with last year. After the autumn harvest, most peasants are making long-term production plans, increasing purchases of cattle, raising pigs and chickens, and everyone is saying: "Thanks to Chairman Mao's good fortune, we have brought this year's bumper harvest and led us to stand up, so we have such a good life." In addition, we also reformed the political power in the production movement, establishing 17 township people's governments and 17 township peasant associations, training 452 peasant cadres, with 26,742 peasants participating in peasant associations, and 1,600 young peasants participating in militia organizations, including 480 party members and 320 members of the Communist Youth League, playing a leading and promoting role in various tasks. Finally, all cadres in the rectification movement deeply reflected on the coercive orders and bureaucratic style in last year's autumn grain requisition, implemented the party's mass line and correctly implemented policies in this year's autumn grain requisition. At the same time, due to the peasants' enthusiasm for loving the motherland, they over-fulfilled the task in one month. Now all cadres remember what you said: "Be a primary school student of the masses," and have developed the habit of consulting with the masses on everything. Now the peasants in the entire district are actively producing and stepping up fertilizer accumulation, preparing for large-scale production next year, while actively preparing to implement land reform. The peasant associations are rectifying their ranks. The teachers in the entire district are also actively promoting the land reform law and how to divide classes. Every young and middle-aged peasant in Shaoshan Township has a booklet and a pen. The party and Youth League branches more systematically lead everyone to study the land reform law. Chairman Mao: Our land reform preparations are underway. Soon, your hometown – the Third District of Xiangtan – will begin to distribute land.

　　湖南湘潭三区全体干部
    上书毛主席报告一年工作
    今年度过灾荒又增产粮食十五万石
    【本报讯】湖南省湘潭县第三区人民政府全体干部向毛主席报告全区一年来的工作情况。原文如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    当农村中马上要开始轰轰烈烈的翻身斗争——土地改革运动以前，我们把在您的故乡——湖南湘潭三区——一年来的工作报告给您。
    一年来全区在秋征、反霸、减租、生产运动、民主建政等工作中，都站在每个运动的最前线。如去年秋征时，我们全体干部与群众在不到三个月时间，就完成了上级党分配的七万三千石公粮任务。虽然去年解放前经过八、九个月的游击战争，青年农民大部参军，使庄稼作物大部减产，可是从干部到群众，没有一个人说闲话的。大家都愉快的缴粮，特别是在韶山村全村多缴公粮一百多石。今年正月开始清匪反霸，党支部动员许多青年农民参军，成立区中队自卫队发动群众剿匪，共消灭三股土匪；又破获匪特们组织的“湖南人民反共总队部”，缴获匪特长短枪三十二枝，电话、收音机二部，捕获、争取、瓦解土匪七十人。到现在群众可以不关门睡觉了。三月间，全区又展开减租退押运动，发动农民向地主进行尖锐斗争，初步打垮了地主阶级的威风；取消伪保甲制度；建立了二十一个村农民协会，男女老幼农民都纷纷加入农民协会。计农民共获得租谷一万零五百四十九石，退押金银洋二万五千四百元，金子二十一两，清理积谷四千一百石；这些果实解决了今春夏荒时大部分农民缺粮的困难。
    由于蒋白匪帮的长期搜括，弄得老百姓穷困不堪，大家生产情绪极其低落，这是今年春夏荒灾的重要原因。经过政府救济及我们发动群众生产度荒，提高了全体农民的生产热情，去冬全部进行了冬耕，今春又开荒地二千七百九十四亩，水田六十亩。不仅胜利地度过了灾荒，还增产了粮食，计全区九万七千四百五十亩田，共可增产稻谷两万石左右，增产红薯二十多万石，总共比去年增产粮十五万石左右。秋收后，农民大部作长远生产打算，增买耕牛养猪喂鸡，大家都说：“托毛主席的鸿福，带来了今年的丰收，又领导我们翻身，才有这样的好日子。”此外我们还在生产运动中改造了政权，计共建立十七个乡人民政府，十七个乡农民协会，培养农民干部四百五十二人，有二万六千七百四十二个农民参加农民协会，一千六百个青年农民参加了民兵组织，其中有四百八十个党员和三百二十个青年团员，在各种工作中起着领导与推动作用。最后全区干部在整风中深刻反省了去年秋征中的强迫命令和官僚主义作风，在今年秋征中贯彻了党的群众路线，正确执行了政策，同时由于农民热爱祖国的热忱，在一个月内即超额完成了任务。现在全体干部都记得您讲的：“当群众小学生”的话，养成了有事就和群众商量的习惯。现在全区农民都在一面积极生产加紧积肥，准备明年大生产，一面积极准备实行土地改革。农民协会正在整顿队伍。全区教员也积极宣传土地改革法和怎样划分阶级。韶山乡每个青壮年农民每人都备有一本小册子，一枝水笔。党、团支部更有计划地领导大家学习土地改革法。毛主席：我们的土地改革准备工作正在做，不久，您的故乡——湘潭三区就开始分田了。
