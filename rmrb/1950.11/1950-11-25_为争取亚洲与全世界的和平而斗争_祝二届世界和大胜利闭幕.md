　　Struggle for Peace in Asia and the World
    ——Congratulating the Victorious Conclusion of the Second World Peace Congress
    The Second World Peace Congress victoriously concluded in Warsaw on the 22nd. Amidst the cheers of "Peace" from all the delegates, the Congress passed a declaration to the people of the world and an appeal to the United Nations Organization. This declaration and appeal represent the common desire and determination of the people of eighty countries to strive for peace. This great program of action and righteous call will unite the peace-loving people of the world more broadly and closely to launch a wider, more active, and more resolute struggle to shatter the war adventure plans of the US-British bloc and its acts of aggression that undermine peace in Asia. In the great and sacred struggle to unite the people of the world in a common quest for peace, the World Peace Congress has once again achieved a brilliant victory. The Chinese people, who love peace and are fighting heroically alongside the Korean people to achieve peace, fully support the declaration and appeal of the Second World Peace Congress and vow to fight resolutely to the end to achieve all the goals set forth in the declaration and appeal.
    The success of the Second World Peace Congress fully demonstrates the powerful and invincible strength of the world's peace forces. The US-British war bloc fears peace, especially the peace forces of the people of the world, and has therefore exhausted all its shameless efforts to obstruct the holding of the Congress. But in the face of the powerful world people's peace forces, the war-mongers' evil conspiracies have been completely and miserably defeated. The smooth progress and brilliant success of the Congress is a severe blow to the war-mongers of the US-British bloc who attempt to threaten all mankind with war. The victory of the Congress is not only the formulation and adoption of the declaration and appeal, but also the unification of the vast people of eighty countries with different political and religious beliefs, and different skin colors under the banner of peace. The 1,755 delegates who attended the Congress were not only representatives of the people of the Soviet Union, China, the various people's democracies of Europe, Korea, Vietnam, and the colonial and semi-colonial countries, but also included representatives of the people of the United States, Britain, and the US-British bloc's vassal states. The people of all these countries, including the people of the United States and Britain, are firmly opposed to the US-British bloc's war adventure plans and its insane acts of aggression in Asia. This iron fact fully demonstrates that the forces of peace occupy an absolute majority among the people of the world, and the war-mongers are completely isolated. The hypocrisy of the "voting machine" manipulated by the US-British bloc in the United Nations has also been completely exposed by this iron fact.
    But as the Second World Peace Congress declaration points out, the current world situation is that "war threatens humanity – men, women, and children." World peace is in the most serious danger since the Second World War. At the same time, the peace of Asian countries such as Korea, China, and Vietnam has been brutally undermined by the ever-expanding aggression of US imperialism. As the world knows, US imperialism is conducting a brutal war of aggression and slaughter in Korea, has armed and occupied our territory of Taiwan, and is carrying out armed intervention in the people of Vietnam and the Philippines, attempting to use encirclement to lead the flames of war to the land of New China. Many irrefutable pieces of evidence have repeatedly shown the people of the world that the purpose of US imperialism in launching a war of aggression in Korea is mainly to invade China. In addition to those well-known pieces of evidence, this newspaper recently reprinted two strategic maps of US imperialism published in Wall Street's mouthpiece "U.S. News & World Report" and "Collier's" magazine, which clearly marked attack arrows pointing towards the Chinese mainland. The Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate this naked and evil conspiracy of US imperialism. From years of struggle experience, the Chinese people know deeply that only by actively resisting aggression can we stop atrocities and achieve peace. As the Second World Peace Congress declaration emphasizes, "We must not wait for peace, we must strive for peace." When peace in Asia has been brutally undermined and their own country is shrouded in the threat of a war of aggression, the Chinese people have unanimously risen up and formed volunteer forces fighting in Korea, striking a heavy blow to the US aggressors with practical actions. This is the Chinese people's great and just action to strive for peace. The appearance of the warriors of the Chinese Volunteer Army on the Korean battlefield has initially changed the war situation in Korea, causing panic and anxiety among the US aggressors.
    The struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Korea is to repel the most ferocious and arrogant imperialist aggression and to strive for and restore peace in Korea, China, and Asia. This is the most important step taken by the Chinese patriotic people in contributing to the cause of world peace. The Second World Peace Congress declaration also specifically emphasizes: "Let us work together to demand an end to the war that is ravaging Korea today and will throw the world into flames tomorrow." Today, the world's people's efforts to strive for peace must first stop the war of aggression being waged by US imperialism in Korea and fight to restore peace in Asia. Because stopping the aggression against Korea and restoring peace in Asia is not only beneficial to the Chinese people, the Korean people, the Vietnamese people, and the people of all Asia, but also of extreme importance to defending and striving for world peace.
    In the work of striving to restore peace in Asia and striving for world peace, we Chinese people fully and unreservedly support the specific steps and methods proposed in the Second World Peace Congress declaration and appeal, which are: (1) "Withdraw foreign troops from Korea and peacefully resolve the civil war between the two parts of Korea with the participation of representatives of the Korean people." "This issue should be resolved by a fully constituted Security Council including representatives of the People's Republic of China." At the same time, "stop the intervention of US troops in China's Taiwan, and the war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam." (2) It is necessary to "convene a conference of the five major powers – the Soviet Union, the United States, France, Britain, and the People's Republic of China – as soon as possible to discuss and peacefully resolve current differences." (3) "Resolutely demand the conclusion of peace treaties with a unified, demilitarized Germany and Japan, and the withdrawal of occupying forces from those two countries." For the people of Asia and China, the first step is to withdraw the US occupying forces from Japan and conclude a comprehensive peace treaty with Japan as soon as possible. (4) Stop new war propaganda, and parliaments of all countries should pass laws "stipulating that anyone who engages in new war propaganda in any form should be held criminally liable." (5) Severely punish war criminals and investigate "the responsibility of General MacArthur for the crimes committed in the aggression against Korea." (6) "Unconditionally prohibit all kinds of atomic weapons, bacteriological and chemical weapons, poison gas, radioactive weapons, and other tools of mass destruction of humanity; declare that the government that first uses these weapons is a war criminal." (7) Reduce armies, and the major powers should "simultaneously and gradually reduce all armies – land, air, and naval forces – by one-third to one-half in proportion during the period from 1951 to 1952." These many methods and steps are necessary to restore peace in Asia and strive for world peace, and have always been firmly advocated by the Chinese people and the peace-loving people of the world.
    The Second World Peace Congress has issued a righteous call, and hundreds of millions of men and women in countries around the world will launch a more active and selfless struggle to strive for peace. In Asia, the heroic Korean army and people and the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army are the most glorious vanguards of striving for peace, whom the whole world admires. The people of all China, all Asia, and the whole world support the heroic struggle of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Forward! Advance bravely to strive for peace in Asia and the world! The forces of peace are powerful and invincible, and the struggle of the people of the world to strive for peace will inevitably be victorious!

　　为争取亚洲与全世界的和平而斗争
    ——祝二届世界和大胜利闭幕
    第二届世界保卫和平大会于二十二日在华沙胜利闭幕了。大会在全体代表欢呼“和平”声中，通过了告全世界人民的宣言及致联合国组织的呼吁书。这宣言和呼吁书代表着世界上八十个国家人民争取和平的共同意愿与决心。这个伟大的行动纲领和正义的号召，将使全世界爱好和平的人民更广泛、更紧密地团结起来，为粉碎美英集团的战争冒险计划及其在亚洲破坏和平的侵略行为而展开更广泛、更积极、更坚决的斗争。在团结全世界人民共同争取和平的伟大的、神圣的斗争中，世界保卫和平大会又一次取得了辉煌的胜利。热爱和平并为争取和平而与朝鲜人民一起英勇战斗的中国人民，完全拥护二届世界和大的宣言与呼吁书，并誓为实现宣言与呼吁书上所规定的一切目标而坚决斗争到底。
    二届世界和大的成功，充分地证明了世界和平力量的强大无敌。美英战争集团害怕和平，尤其害怕全世界人民的和平力量，因而曾罄其一切无耻的努力，企图阻挠大会的举行。但是在强大的世界人民和平力量的面前，战争贩子们的罪恶阴谋遭到了彻底的惨败。大会的顺利进行和辉煌成功，是对企图以战争威胁全人类的美英集团战争贩子的一个严重的打击。大会的胜利不仅是制订并通过了宣言和呼吁书，而且是在和平的旗帜下团结了世界上八十个国家有着不同政治、宗教信仰，和有着不同肤色的广大人民。出席大会的一千七百五十五位代表，不仅是苏联、中国、欧洲各人民民主国家、朝鲜、越南以及殖民地半殖民地国家人民的代表，而且也包括了美国、英国及美英集团附庸国家人民的代表。所有这些国家的人民，包括美国和英国的人民在内，都是坚决反对美英集团战争冒险计划及其在亚洲的疯狂侵略行为的。这个铁的事实，就充分说明了在全世界人民当中和平力量占有绝对的多数，战争贩子是完全孤立的。美英集团在联合国所操纵的“表决机器”的虚伪性，也就被这个铁的事实所完全戳穿了。
    但正如二届和大宣言所指出的，当前的世界形势是“战争威胁着人类——男女和儿童”。世界和平已处于第二次世界大战以来最严重的危险中，同时，朝鲜、中国，以及越南等亚洲国家的和平，则已因美帝国主义不断扩大侵略而遭受了横暴的破坏。举世周知，美帝国主义在朝鲜进行着凶残的侵略战争与屠杀，武装侵占了我国的领土台湾，并对越南、菲律宾人民实行武装干涉，企图用包围的形势，把战争的火焰引到新中国的土地上来。许多无可辩驳的证据，向全世界人民一再显示了美帝国主义在朝鲜发动侵略战争的目的，主要地是侵略中国。在那些人所共知的证据之外，最近本报曾连续翻印了华尔街的喉舌《美国新闻与世界报导》与《柯里尔》杂志所刊载的两张美国帝国主义的战略地图，那上面明显标出的进攻箭头，都是指向着中国大陆。对于美国帝国主义这种赤裸裸的罪恶阴谋，中国人民是绝对不能容忍的。从多少年来的斗争经验中，中国人民深知只有以积极行动抵抗侵略，才能制止暴行，取得和平。也正如二届和大的宣言中所强调指出的：“绝不能等待和平，必须去争取和平。”中国人民在亚洲的和平遭受到横暴破坏，自己的国土为侵略战争的威胁所笼罩着的时候，已一致奋起，组成正在朝鲜作战的志愿部队，以实际行动沉重地打击着美国侵略者。这就是中国人民争取和平的伟大的正义行动。中国志愿部队的勇士们在朝鲜战场的出现，已初步改变了朝鲜的战局，使美国侵略者感到恐慌与忧虑了。
    中国人民志愿部队在朝鲜的斗争，是为了击退最凶恶最狂妄的帝国主义侵略，争取与恢复朝鲜、中国以及亚洲的和平。这是中国爱国人民致力于世界和平事业的最重大步骤。二届和大的宣言也特别强调指出：“让我们一致努力，要求停止今日蹂躏着朝鲜而明日势将全世界投入火焰的战争。”世界人民在今日争取和平的努力，首先是要制止美帝国主义在朝鲜所进行的侵略战争，并为恢复亚洲的和平而斗争。因为，制止对朝鲜的侵略与恢复亚洲的和平，不但对中国人民、朝鲜人民、越南人民、以及全亚洲的人民是有利的，而且也是对保卫并争取世界和平有着极端重要的意义的。
    在争取恢复亚洲和平与争取世界和平的工作中，我们中国人民完全无保留地拥护二届和大宣言和呼吁书中所提出的具体步骤与办法，那就是：（一）“自朝鲜撤退外国军队，并在朝鲜人民代表参加之下，和平解决朝鲜两部分地区之间的内战。”“这个问题应由包括中华人民共和国代表在内的、组织完全的安全理事会来加以解决。”同时，“制止美国军队对中国的台湾的干涉，以及对越南民主共和国进行的战争”。（二）必须“尽速召开五大国—苏联、美国、法国、英国、中华人民共和国—会议，来讨论与和平解决目前的意见分歧”。（三）“坚决要求与统一的、非军事化的德国和日本缔结和约，并从该两国撤退占领军。”对于亚洲与中国人民，则是首先撤退美国在日本的占领军，并尽速缔结全面对日和约。（四）制止新战争宣传，各国议会应通过法律，“规定不论以任何形式进行新战争宣传均应负刑事责任”。（五）严惩战争罪犯，调查对侵略朝鲜所犯罪行的“麦克阿瑟将军的责任问题”。（六）“无条件禁止各种原子武器、细菌和化学武器、毒气、放射性武器以及其他大规模毁灭人类的工具；宣布首先使用这些武器的政府为战争罪犯。”（七）裁减军队，各大国“在一九五一年到一九五二年期间，按比例同时逐渐裁减一切军队——陆军、空军和海军——裁减量从三分之一到二分之一”。这许多办法和步骤是恢复亚洲和平与争取世界和平所必需的，也是中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民所历来坚决主张的。
    二届和大已发出正义的号召，世界各国亿万男女将为争取和平而展开更积极的忘我的斗争。在亚洲，英勇的朝鲜军民和英勇的中国人民志愿部队，乃是全世界所一致敬仰的争取和平的最光荣的先锋队。全中国、全亚洲和全世界的人民支援着朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队的英勇斗争。前进！为争取亚洲与全世界的和平而奋勇前进！和平力量是强大无敌的，世界人民争取和平的斗争将必然取得胜利！
