Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 4th: TASS reports: Fadeyev, General Secretary of the Soviet Writers' Union, sent a telegram to Denis Pritt, Chairman of the British-Soviet Culture Association in London on November 4th, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Soviet Writers' Union, to express condolences on the death of the famous British writer George Bernard Shaw.

The original telegram is as follows: "We are deeply saddened to hear of the death of the great writer George Bernard Shaw. Shaw was a master of satire, a passionate exposer of all social evils and injustices, and a defender of human progress. He made an invaluable contribution to the treasure trove of world literature.

Shaw was an old friend of the Soviet Union. Many of us still remember his visit to the Soviet state in 1931. We know that in the days when the Soviet people were undergoing the most severe trials, Shaw spoke out for the Soviet Union and opposed the organizers of anti-Soviet intervention.

His works are widely read. His plays performed in Soviet theaters have all been successful. We will always remember this great writer - humanitarian, George Bernard Shaw."

　　法捷耶夫电唁萧伯纳逝世
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科四日电：苏联作家协会总书记法捷耶夫于十一月四日致电伦敦英苏文化协会主席丹尼斯·普里特，代表苏联作家协会中央委员会吊唁英国名作家萧伯纳逝世。
    原电如下：“惊悉伟大作家萧伯纳逝世，深为哀痛。萧伯纳是讽刺的大师，一切社会罪恶与不义现象的热心的揭露者，人类进步的维护者，他对于世界文学的宝库作了无可估价的贡献。
    萧伯纳是苏联的老朋友。我们有许多人还记得他于一九三一年来访苏维埃国家的情形。我们知道，在苏维埃人民经受着最严酷的考验的日子，萧伯纳为苏联而仗义执言，反对反苏干涉的组织者。
    他的著作，读者很广。苏联的剧院所演出了的他的剧本，莫不获得成功。我们将永远纪念着这位伟大的作家——人道主义者萧伯纳。”
