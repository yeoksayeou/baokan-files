　　Cannot Sit Idly By While the U.S. Imperialists Expand Their Aggression!
    Readers of This Newspaper Write in One After Another to Advocate
    Resisting America and Aiding Korea to Protect Our Homes and Defend Our Country.
    Many Readers Also Express Their Willingness to Go to Korea to Participate in the Anti-Aggression War
    [This Newspaper] The Chinese people can no longer tolerate the emergency situation where the flames of the U.S.'s mad expansion of the war of aggression against Korea seriously threatens China's security. People from all walks of life across the country have written to this newspaper, expressing their boundless hatred for U.S. imperialism, and advocating taking various voluntary actions to resolutely resist and strike at the U.S.'s crimes of aggression against Korea and China, to defend the good life of our people, defend their hometowns, and defend the frontiers of the motherland. Many letters even strongly expressed their desire to take voluntary action and go to Korea to participate in the war, and join the Korean people in resisting U.S. imperialist aggression. This shows that a broad mass movement of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting homes, and defending the country is rapidly taking shape.
    In the past ten days alone, this newspaper has received over a thousand letters from various localities, agencies, organizations, factories, schools, and military units, both collective and individual. Below are some of these letters.
    The Korean People Actively Helped the Chinese Revolution; the Chinese People Should Also Help the Korean People's Liberation.
    Editor:
    The U.S. imperialists' act of aggression against Korea and our country's airspace is truly intolerable to us. Today, the flames of war have already spread to our motherland's borders. Premier Zhou already pointed out in his report celebrating National Day: "The Chinese people will never tolerate foreign aggression, nor will they stand idly by and allow imperialists to wantonly commit aggression against their neighbors." We firmly support this statement. At the same time, we must also warn the U.S. imperialist warmongers: "The Chinese people love peace, but in order to defend peace, they have never been afraid of resisting wars of aggression." Now is the time for us to act. Korea is our close neighbor, as close as lips and teeth. In the past, the Korean people regarded the Chinese people's cause of liberation as their own cause of liberation. Especially during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the four-year War of Liberation, many Korean people, like many other international friends, actively participated in the Chinese people's cause of liberation, shedding their blood and sacrificing their lives. Today, the U.S. imperialists' acts of aggression have caused the Korean people to suffer unprecedented catastrophe. We should also participate in the Korean people's anti-U.S. war. At the same time, we call on young comrades to go to Korea with a high degree of internationalism and fight alongside the Korean people to completely eliminate the U.S. imperialist aggressors. Peace-loving people all over the world stand with us. We must participate in the Korean people's cause of liberation just as the Korean people helped the Chinese revolution in the past. Like the people of conscience all over the world who aided the Spanish people in their fight against Franco during the Spanish Civil War, we must actively rise up to strike at the aggressors and extinguish the flames of the U.S. imperialist war of aggression.

    U.S. Imperialism is Following the Old Path of Japan in Invading Our Country.
    Our People Must Actively Resist America and Aid Korea.
    Editor:
    The U.S. imperialists, under the guise of the United Nations, are conducting a mad massacre against the peaceful people of Korea. The U.S. imperialists have expanded their war of aggression and have repeatedly invaded our country's airspace, bombing and strafing our people. Although Foreign Minister Zhou has repeatedly protested, they have not stopped their acts of aggression. The war in Korea is no longer simply a Korean issue. In fact, U.S. imperialism is following the old path of Japanese imperialism, striking at our heads. "If the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold." We cannot ignore this. We should bring out our strength and take practical actions to quickly aid the Korean people and resist U.S. imperialist aggression. We cannot reason with man-eating wolves. We are a peace-loving country, but we are not afraid of wars of aggression. We will fight for lasting world peace. Imperialist countries unite to attack Korea and the peaceful people. We, the people's democratic countries, have even more reason to unite to oppose wars of aggression.

    U.S. Imperialism Has Brought the Flames of Aggression to Our Heads.
    We Workers Advocate Immediately Rising Up to Defend the Motherland.
    Editor:
    Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country, after eight years of arduous War of Resistance, overthrew Japanese imperialism. But U.S. imperialism helped the reactionaries and attacked the Chinese people, using large amounts of money and weapons to arm Chiang Kai-shek, the deadly enemy of the Chinese people, and waged a large-scale reactionary civil war, slaughtering millions of Chinese people. People's property was devastated. Thinking of these things, we hate U.S. imperialism to the core. Now we have just begun peaceful construction, and a free and happy New China is right before our eyes. U.S. imperialism's ambitions have not died. It hurriedly invaded Korea, and under the pretext of the Korean issue, expanded its aggression against our country, occupied our Taiwan Province, and repeatedly violated our airspace and territorial waters, killing our compatriots. Recently, it has become even more intensified, becoming increasingly brazen, crossing the 38th parallel and approaching our border, seriously threatening the security of our New China. Our 475 million people love peace, but U.S. imperialism is determined to destroy peace, madly expanding the war and bringing the flames of war to our heads. The Chinese people can no longer tolerate this! Therefore, all 3,000 of our employees unanimously advocate immediately mobilizing to eliminate the aggressors and defend the peace of China, Asia, and the world.

    The Chinese People, to Defend Their Homes and Defend Their Country,
    Will Surely Beat the U.S. Imperialists Until Their Heads are Bloodied and They are Completely Defeated.
    Editor:
    U.S. imperialism is destroying our peaceful construction, hindering us from having a good life, and invading our territory of Taiwan. Its planes have also continuously strafed our fathers, elders, brothers and sisters in the Northeast. This series of acts of aggression by U.S. imperialism against our country illustrates the nature of imperialism. Now it is openly advancing towards our Northeast border region. We cannot tolerate these atrocities. All of our comrades unanimously protest. We, the working class, are not afraid of U.S. imperialism, this paper tiger. We, the working class, will not only increase production on the production front, overfulfill our tasks, and produce more steel, but we also decided to take practical actions to resist American aggression, support Korea, defend our motherland, and defend our homes. We must make U.S. imperialism follow the same path of failure as the Japanese devils, and beat it until its head is bloodied and it is completely defeated, so that we can concentrate on production.
    With best regards,

    Maintain a High Degree of Vigilance to Defend the Motherland's Coastal Defense.
    Do Not Let U.S. Imperialism Occupy an Inch of Our Land.
    Editor:
    The more frantic U.S. imperialist aggression becomes, and the more cruel its burning and killing of the Korean people, the more it will arouse the resentment and opposition of the people of the world, and the more it will hasten its demise.
    Korea is our neighbor, and we and the Korean people are like brothers. They shed blood in our revolutionary war, and they contributed to the liberation of our people. We cannot forget this. Now they are being slaughtered by U.S. imperialism, and they are living a life of extreme suffering. We absolutely cannot tolerate this.
    Comrades in the army! We are the defenders of the motherland. We are standing on the front line of national defense. Our mission is the most arduous, the most great, and the most glorious. We must be highly vigilant, hold our guns tightly, and monitor the actions of imperialism.
    Compatriots! Our war of liberation has not yet ended, and the construction of New China is just beginning. U.S. imperialism is expanding the war, invading our neighbor – Korea, invading our territory – Taiwan, and violating our Northeast airspace, bombing our peaceful residents. We resolutely protest against this barbarous behavior and strengthen our preparations to wage a tenacious struggle against the enemy.
    Peace-loving people all over the world! We know that war is the most cruel. What we need is peace. We must unite closely and act together to stop U.S. imperialism's aggression against Korea and its ambition to enslave the people of the world, and fight to the end to defend lasting world peace.
    Here, I guarantee to the higher-level party and to the people of the whole country that I will resolutely respond to your call, thoroughly complete all the tasks you have given me, and set an example, lead the troops to study hard, strengthen our work, be highly vigilant, and defend our coastal defense. If the imperialists dare to take the risk of invading our borders, we will simply wipe them all out in the sea, and never let them occupy an inch of our land.

    Actively Launch a Military Training Movement to Build a Strong National Defense Army.
    If U.S. Imperialism's Devilish Hands Reach Into China, We Will Chop Them Off With One Blow.
    Editor:
    After attending the National Combat Heroes Conference in Beijing and bidding farewell to the delegation of world youth in Nanjing, I returned to the troops to convey the spirit of the conference to the troops.
    The troops have studied Chairman Mao's congratulatory message and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's speech at the conference of representatives of model heroes, as well as Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order on National Day, and Premier Zhou's "Strive for the Development and Consolidation of the People's Victory" and other documents. All commanders and fighters are actively launching a military training movement to respond to the call of the leaders with practical actions.
    Today, while I am conveying the spirit of the National Combat Heroes Representatives Conference, the newspaper published the news that "The U.S. Imperialist Aggressor Troops are Approaching the Chinese Border, Seriously Threatening Our Country's Security." I and all the commanders and fighters of our troops firmly express the following regarding this situation:
    1. Seriously protest the U.S. imperialist planes' repeated invasion of our country's airspace, killing and wounding our compatriots, and damaging our property. Resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's telegram to the United Nations on October 26, accusing the U.S. of its crimes of expanding the war of aggression.
    2. We are closely concerned about the situation in Korea. We oppose U.S. imperialist aggression against our friendly neighbor, and we are determined to take practical actions to defend the borders of the motherland.
    3. We love peace, but we are not afraid of war. We will never allow the U.S. imperialist aggressors to threaten the security of our country's territory. We will never allow the U.S. imperialists to invade China. If the U.S. imperialists dare to extend their devilish hands of aggression into China, we will resolutely chop off their devilish hands.
    4. Put down all burdens, discard all personal plans, improve combat will, promote new heroism, actively train troops, improve our skills, liberate Jinmen, liberate Taiwan, and build a strong national defense army, and use our practical actions to defend national defense and defend world peace.
          Combat Hero Liu Kuiji

    U.S. Imperialism Threatens Our Northeast Industrial Area.
    The Chinese and Korean People Should Immediately Fight Side by Side.
    Editor:
    Recently, U.S. imperialism has expanded its aggression against our neighbor, Korea, violated Chinese airspace, bombed the Northeast, shelled our merchant ships, and occupied Taiwan. This shameless atrocity has deepened our hatred for the aggressors. The expansion of U.S. imperialist aggression seriously threatens peace in the Far East, especially the security of our Northeast industrial area. Our broad masses of students firmly support the statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on October 10, and request to help the Korean people with practical actions. We should fight side by side with the Korean People's Army and guerrillas to defeat the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops in Korea, smash the U.S. imperialists' arrogant conspiracy to use Korea as a military springboard to launch a new world war, and help the Korean people liberate themselves from the abyss of suffering. This is the common will and desire of the Korean people, the Chinese people, and all peace-loving and democratic people in the world. The Chinese people have the right to carry out this solemn combat mission!

　　不能坐视美帝扩大侵略！
    本报读者纷纷来信主张
    实行抗美援朝保家卫国
    很多读者并表示志愿赴朝参加反侵略战争
    【本报讯】我国人民对于美国疯狂扩大侵朝战争的火焰，严重威胁我国安全的紧急形势，已经忍无可忍。国内各阶层各界人民纷纷投书本报，表示对美帝的无边仇恨，并主张采取各种志愿的行动，坚决抵抗与打击美帝对于朝鲜和中国的侵略罪行，以保卫我国人民的好光景，保卫自己的家乡，保卫祖国的边疆。有很多来信更强烈地表示他们要以志愿的行动，到朝鲜去参加作战，和朝鲜人民一道反抗美帝的侵略。这显示了一个广大群众性的抗美援朝保家卫国的自发运动正在迅速形成着。
    总计在最近十天中，本报所收到的各地、各机关、团体、工厂、学校以及部队等各单位集体的和个人的来信已达千余封。下面就是这些来信的一部分。
    朝鲜人民曾积极帮助中国革命，中国人民也应帮助朝鲜人民解放。编辑同志：
    美帝侵犯朝鲜以及我国领空的暴行实在使我们不能忍受了，今天战火已经燃烧到我们祖国的边境。周总理在庆祝国庆的报告中已经指出：“中国人民决不能容忍外国的侵略，也不能听任帝国主义者对自己的邻人肆行侵略而置之不理。”我们坚决拥护这个声明。同时，我们也要正告美帝国主义战争贩子们：“中国人民热爱和平，但是为了保卫和平，从不也永远不害怕反抗侵略战争。”现在，是我们行动的时候了，朝鲜是我们唇齿相依的邻邦，在过去朝鲜人民曾经把中国人民的解放事业看成自己的解放事业一样，特别在抗日战争与四年的解放战争中，不少的朝鲜人民和其他许多国际友人一样，积极地参加了中国人民的解放事业，抛头颅、洒热血，今天美帝国主义侵略暴行曾经使朝鲜人民遭受到空前的浩劫，我们也应当参加到朝鲜人民反美战争中去，同时也号召青年同志们以高度国际主义的精神到朝鲜去和朝鲜人民一道作战，彻底消灭美帝侵略军。全世界爱好和平的人们都和我们站在一起。我们要像当年朝鲜人民帮助中国革命一样，参加朝鲜人民的解放事业，要像西班牙内战时期，全世界力持正义的人士援助西班牙人民反抗佛朗哥一样，积极起来打击侵略者，以扑灭美帝侵略战争的火焰。

    美帝走着日本老路侵略我国
    我们人民要积极抗美援朝编辑同志：
    美帝假借联合国名义，对朝鲜和平人民进行了疯狂的屠杀。美帝扩大侵略战争，曾数次侵入我国领空，并轰炸、扫射我国人民；周外长虽曾一再提出抗议，但并没有停止其侵略活动。现在朝鲜的战争，不单纯是朝鲜问题了，事实上美帝是走上了日本帝国主义的老路，打到我们头上来了。“唇亡齿寒”，我们不能置之不理。我们应拿出我们的力量来，用实际行动迅速援助朝鲜人民，反抗美帝国主义的侵略。我们不能对吃人的狼来讲道理了。我们是爱好和平的国家，但也不怕侵略战争，为了世界持久和平而战。帝国主义国家联合起来，对朝鲜，对和平人民进攻，我们人民民主国家是更有理由团结起来，反对侵略战争的。

    美帝把侵略战火烧到了我们头上
    我们工人主张立即起来保卫祖国编辑同志：
    全国人民在毛主席英明领导下，经过八年艰苦抗战，打倒了日本帝国主义。但美帝国主义却帮助反动派，向中国人民进攻，以大批金元、武器武装中国人民死敌蒋介石，进行大规模反动内战，残杀中国人民数百万。人民财产横遭浩劫。想起这些，我们把美帝恨透了。现在我们刚开始和平建设，自由幸福的新中国就在眼前了。美帝野心不死，急忙侵略朝鲜，并借口朝鲜问题，扩大对我国的侵略，占领我们台湾省，多次侵犯我领空、领海，杀害我国同胞。最近更变本加厉，得寸进尺，越过三八线，逼近我国边境，严重地威胁着我新中国的安全。我四万七千五百万人民酷爱和平，但美帝决心破坏和平，疯狂扩大战争，把战火烧到我们头上。中国人民再不能容忍了！因此我们全体三千职工一致主张立即动员起来，消灭侵略者，保卫中国、亚洲和全世界的和平。

    中国人民为了保卫家乡保卫祖国
    定要打得美帝头破血流完全失败编辑同志：
    美帝国主义破坏我们的和平建设，妨害我们过好光景，侵略我国领台湾，其飞机又连续扫射我东北的父老兄弟们，美帝国主义对我国这一连续的侵略事实，说明了帝国主义的本质。现在他公然向我东北边界地区前进，我们对他这些暴行是不能忍受的。我们全体同志一致提出抗议。我们工人阶级对于美帝国主义这个纸老虎并不害怕。我们工人阶级不仅在生产战线上要加大生产，超额完成任务，多出钢铁，我们并决定以实际行动，抵抗美国侵略，支援朝鲜，保卫我们的祖国，保卫我们的家乡。我们要叫美帝国主义走上日本鬼子同样失败的道路，要打得他头破血流完全失败才能使我们安心生产。
    致以

    高度警惕保卫祖国海防
    不让美帝占我一寸土地编辑同志：
    美帝国主义的侵略越疯狂，对朝鲜人民的烧杀越惨酷，就越激起全世界人民的愤恨和反对，也就是越促使它的死亡。
    朝鲜是我们的邻邦，我们和朝鲜人民如同兄弟一样。他们曾在我国革命战争中流过血，他们曾为我国人民的解放出过力，我们是不能忘记的。现在他们正受着美帝的屠杀，他们在过着万分痛苦的生活，我们是绝不能容忍的。
    部队的同志们！我们是祖国的捍卫者，我们正站在国防的最前线，我们的任务是最艰巨最伟大最光荣的，我们要高度的警惕，紧握着我们的枪，监视着帝国主义的行动。
    同胞们！我们的解放战争还未结束，新中国正在开始建设，美帝扩大战争侵略我邻邦——朝鲜，侵略我国领土——台湾，并侵犯我东北领空，轰炸我和平居民。这种蛮横行为，我们坚决提出抗议，并加强准备与敌人作顽强的斗争。
    全世界爱好和平的人民！我们知道战争是最残酷的，我们需要的是和平。我们要亲密的团结在一起，一致行动起来，制止美帝侵略朝鲜、梦想奴役全世界人民的野心，为保卫世界永久和平奋斗到底。
    我在这里向上级党保证，向全国人民保证，坚决响应你们的号召，彻底完成你们所给予的一切任务，一定以身作则，带领部队努力学习，加强工作，高度的警惕着，保卫着我们的海防。若帝国主义者敢来冒险侵犯我们的边境，就干脆全部地消灭它在海里，决不让它占我一寸土地。
          战斗英雄  李国英
    积极展开练兵运动建设强大国防军
    美帝魔手伸入中国就把它一刀砍断编辑同志：
    我在北京开完了全国战斗英雄会议，又在南京欢送了世界青年代表团之后，就回到部队，向部队传达了大会的精神。
    部队已学完了英模代表会议上毛主席的祝词和朱总司令的讲话以及国庆节朱总司令的命令，和周总理的“为发展和巩固人民的胜利而奋斗”等文件。全体指战员正积极地开展练兵运动，以实际行动来响应领袖们的号召。
    今天，在我传达全国战斗英雄代表会议精神的同时，报纸上发表了“美帝侵略军逼近中国边境，严重地威胁我国安全”的消息，我和我们部队的全体指战员对此情况坚决表示：
    一、严重抗议美帝飞机屡次侵入我国领空，杀伤我同胞，损坏我财产的暴行，坚决拥护周外长十月二十六日致联合国控诉美帝扩大侵略战争罪行的电报。
    二、我们正密切关怀着朝鲜的战局，我们反对美帝侵略我们的友邻，我们决心以实际行动保卫祖国的边疆。
    三、我们热爱和平，但我们并不害怕战争，我们决不容许美帝侵略军威胁我国领土的安全，我们决不容许美帝向中国侵略，如果美帝敢把它侵略的魔手伸到中国来，我们坚决把它的魔手砍断。
    四、放下一切包袱，丢掉一切个人打算，提高战斗意志，发扬新的英雄主义，积极练兵，提高自己的本领，解放金门，解放台湾，建设一支强大的国防军，以自己的实际行动来保卫国防，保卫世界和平。
          战斗英雄  刘奎基
    美帝威胁我东北工业区
    中朝人民应即并肩作战编辑同志：
    近来美帝扩大侵略我们的邻邦朝鲜，侵犯中国领空，轰炸东北，炮击我国商船，侵占台湾，这种无耻的暴行，更加深我们对侵略者的仇恨，美帝的扩大侵略，严重地威胁了远东的和平，尤其是我国东北工业区的安全。我们广大的同学，坚决拥护十月十日外交部所发表的声明，并请求以实际行动帮助朝鲜人民，我们应当与朝鲜人民军、游击队，并肩作战，击垮美帝在朝鲜的侵略军，粉碎美帝利用朝鲜作为军事跳板发动新的世界大战的狂妄阴谋，并帮助朝鲜人民在水深火热中解放出来，这是朝鲜人民、中国人民，以及全世界爱好和平民主的人民共同的意志与愿望，中国人民有权利执行这个庄严的战斗任务！
