Xinhua News Agency, 13th. Over 300 representatives from people's organizations and various ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia gathered today, unanimously expressing firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou's telegram to the Security Council and the Foreign Ministry Spokesperson's statement on the 11th. Speakers unanimously pointed out that the shameless slanders of warmongers MacArthur and Austin were completely distorted and deliberately nonsensical, and that China's volunteer assistance to Korea to resist the United States was a completely reasonable and just act. Aqi, a soldier from the Inner Mongolia Military Region, said: "The Chinese people's volunteer assistance to Korea to resist the United States is a completely reasonable and just action. When we Chinese resisted aggressors, the Korean people fought side by side with us. The blood of the Korean people was shed on the soil of our motherland. Now that we see our comrades being brutally ravaged by the American imperialists, how can we stand idly by?" Other representatives from all walks of life also unanimously angrily denounced the United States' arrogant attempt to invade our great motherland. They unanimously declared: "We, the great Chinese people who have united, will not be intimidated by any aggressors." The meeting finally unanimously adopted a joint statement by Inner Mongolia's people's organizations, solemnly declaring that the people of Inner Mongolia are willing to unite with all fraternal ethnic groups throughout the country and fight to the end to resist the United States, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country.

　　内蒙各人民团体集会拥护外交部发言人声明
    【新华社十三日讯】内蒙各人民团体和各族各界代表三百余人今日集会，对周外长复安理会电及我外交部发言人十一日声明一致表示坚决拥护。发言者一致指出，战争贩子麦克阿瑟及奥斯汀的无耻谰言完全是颠倒是非，别有用心的胡说，我国人民志愿援朝抗美是完全合理和正义的行为。内蒙军区战士阿其说：中国人民志愿援朝抗美是完全合情合理的义举。我们中国反抗侵略者的时候，朝鲜人民曾同我们并肩作战。我们祖国的土地上曾流洒过朝鲜人民的鲜血。现在我们眼见战友正被美帝惨酷蹂躏，怎能袖手旁观？其他各界代表也一致愤怒地指斥了美国侵略我伟大祖国的狂妄企图。他们一致声明：我们已经团结起来的伟大的中国人民是不会被任何侵略者所吓倒。会议最后一致通过内蒙古各人民团体联合声明，郑重地宣布内蒙人民愿与全国各兄弟民族团结一起，为抗美援朝保家卫国奋斗到底。
