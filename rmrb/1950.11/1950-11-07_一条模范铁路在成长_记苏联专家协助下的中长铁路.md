　　A Model Railway is Growing
    ——On the Chinese Changchun Railway with the Assistance of Soviet Experts
    Hong Liu
    The establishment of the Sino-Soviet jointly operated Chinese Changchun Railway Company on April 25, 1950, was a major event in the history of Chinese railways. Where else in the world would a country like the Soviet Union be willing to spend the huge sum of allowances for 1,500 experts to help China build a model railway, and then hand over the railway and all the company's assets to China in no more than two and a half years? Every Soviet expert who came to the Chinese Changchun Railway said: "Stalin told us: within two and a half years, we must teach Chinese comrades the skills and management methods of enterprises!"
    Soviet experts brought a new atmosphere to the Chinese Changchun Railway.
    In August and September this year, the entire Chinese Changchun Railway was in the midst of a passionate wave of competition to welcome the National Day celebration. From Manzhouli to Suifenhe, from Harbin to Dalian, the numerous large and small stations, workshops, and factory gates were plastered with letters of challenge and response guaranteeing the completion of production and financial plans to welcome the first National Day of the People's Republic of China. The combination of the Chinese working class's high labor enthusiasm and advanced Soviet experience has created many miracles that have broken past production records here! The telephone conference of the Chinese Changchun Railway Bureau held two days before the National Day summarized the achievements of this labor competition: fourteen of the sixteen competition conditions, including the number of loaded wagons, exceeded the guaranteed completion target, enabling the Chinese Changchun Railway to overfulfill the standards stipulated in the production and financial plan for the third quarter.
    Implementing the idea of economic accounting in railway management is a fundamental characteristic that Soviet experts brought to the Chinese Changchun Railway. The implementation of the economic accounting system has completely established the production and financial management of the Chinese Changchun Railway on a scientific and advanced foundation. After the establishment of the Chinese Changchun Railway, Soviet experts and Chinese personnel cooperated to formulate the eight-month production and financial plan of the Chinese Changchun Railway, which implemented the principles of economic accounting. This was the first time that a financial perspective of accumulating national wealth was established for Chinese railways. Before this, the Northeast Railway only had transportation plans in practice, and the financial perspective of how to obtain profits and accumulate funds for the country was vague. Often, only the completion of tasks was emphasized, and costs were rarely calculated. For example, the Shenyang Sub-bureau had ten cars. Before a production and financial plan was established, it was equipped with a welder and a lathe operator; with a dozen teapots, it was equipped with a tinsmith to weld teapots. When the production and financial plan was formulated, Soviet experts investigated the work situation clearly, calculated it, and said: "Even if these cars and teapots are welded every day when they break, it is not enough for eight hours of work. What are they doing with the remaining time?" They suggested that these tasks be outsourced to nearby locomotive depots, and that these people be assigned to places where people were needed. For example, before a production and financial plan was established, the Northeast Railway did not have standards for the use of materials. Various vehicle inspection sections did not specify the dimensions when requesting timber from the materials department. As a result, some timber could not be used because it was not the correct size, and became waste; some timber was too large, and had to be sawn off by as much as one and a half meters when used, which was a great waste. In the past, the Northeast Railway did not have clear regulations on the material quota and financial budget required to complete each project. For example, before the production and financial plan was established, the Steel Beam Team of the Engineering Corps used two engineering locomotives to complete a certain project. After the production and financial plan was established, the Shenyang Sub-bureau repeatedly notified the team to reapply to the Chinese Changchun Railway Bureau for procedures, but the Steel Beam Team ignored it. The sub-bureau strictly implemented the production and financial plan and stopped the use of locomotives. As a result, the captain of the Steel Beam Team came to question the sub-bureau: "Why did you stop the locomotives?" The sub-bureau personnel asked the captain: "Isn't the Engineering Corps also an independent economic accounting unit now? You have your own financial budget for completing the project, and there are expenses for locomotives. The sub-bureau cannot provide them for your use for free. You should pay today!" The captain was forced to calculate it himself and then only requested one locomotive.
    After the implementation of the production and financial plan, the face of the Chinese Changchun Railway was completely renewed. All the large and small factories and workshops on the entire railway began to establish a sense of ownership – the idea of economic accounting. In the past, the Harbin Vehicle Inspection Section would often release the remaining oil residue when washing oil tank cars; after having the production and financial plan, the section stipulated a system where the oil residue was not released when washing oil tank cars, but collected in containers. Every time the oil was collected, two-tenths was given to the workers and eight-tenths was given to the state. In this way, what was useless in the past has now begun to become the wealth of the country.
    The implementation of the production and financial plan relies on a new system for guaranteeing. Here is an example: when a section of the Shenyang Sub-bureau did not have coke, a person in charge of the sub-bureau requested the Administration Bureau to approve money to buy it. The Administration Bureau believed that since there was no coke, it would affect the work, and of course it should be approved. However, when personnel from the section took the approval letter to the material factory to buy it, the person in charge of the material factory disagreed, believing that this was not in line with the principles of economic accounting. The production and financial plan was approved by the government, and the price of coke exceeded the price in the production and financial plan. Even the person in charge of the Administration Bureau did not have the power to violate this plan, and should think of all ways to obtain cheap coke himself, or save a batch of money from other materials to make up for the losses incurred when buying coke. In this way, the unreasonable system of the past, where money could be approved to buy materials as long as the person in charge believed that work needed it, was broken. For example, in the past, when the Harbin Railway Factory repaired passenger cars, it would distribute "waste timber" to employees to take home as firewood; after the new factory director came, he firmly disagreed with doing so. At that time, the union personnel believed that the new factory director "did not care about the welfare of the employees." Later, the new factory director saw that there was a dilapidated club in the factory, and because the state had financial difficulties, the higher authorities had not given money to repair it. He used this batch of "waste timber" to repair the club, repairing the club to look like new. The employees had a place for entertainment, and only then did they feel that it was a waste to burn it as firewood in the past, and therefore greatly admired the new factory director's method.
    When some of our comrades asked why we should save every cent and penny like this, Soviet comrades replied: "Imperialist countries such as Britain and the United States rose by plundering colonies, and their industrial development took a hundred years. However, the development of Soviet industry from the first Five-Year Plan to the Soviet War was only a dozen years, but it has already caught up with the hundred years of development of Britain and the United States. Where did its capital accumulation come from? It came from the workers' enthusiasm and the savings of each enterprise, one cent and one penny at a time. China is a new democratic country, and its economic recovery and development must also take this path of thrift."
    An advanced method of managing enterprises and a reasonable work system need a scientific work style to ensure implementation. Another characteristic of Soviet experts helping China build the Chinese Changchun Railway is the combination of the noble qualities of communism and rich technical and business experience, which is equally important in practical work. For example, when the original Shenyang Railway Administration, with 1,500 people, was reorganized into a sub-bureau, the workload did not decrease much, but the staff was reduced to 207 people. Many Chinese employees initially had no confidence, and still clung to the old work methods and styles, unable to grasp the most important work center at present, liking to arrange many tasks at the same time, liking to grasp everything at once, liking to handle documents, and liking to talk in circles. There was once such a thing: once, a Soviet expert walked into the office and saw a Chinese comrade talking to a cadre, talking for a long, long time, and the conversation was never finished. The Soviet expert asked the translator: "Are they old friends?" The translator said: "No!" The Soviet expert asked: "Are they talking about important work?" The translator said again: "No." When the Soviet expert finally understood that the two of them were meeting for the first time, and were talking about a simple task, he was surprised and said: "Isn't this something that can be explained in two sentences?" This procrastinating rural style that did not pay attention to work efficiency once hindered the rapid development of the Chinese Changchun Railway's work. Advanced business experience, new scientific systems were available, but the people doing the work were still using the old style, and the things of the day would naturally not be completed. Some people shouted: "The Chinese Changchun Railway is established, the number of people is reduced, the number of things has not decreased, and we can't stand it!" Soviet experts said: "It's okay if there are fewer people. It will be chaotic at the beginning, but after a while, it can get on the right track!" Soviet experts came early, left late, and worked night shifts. Some even worked while sick. In this way, under the influence of Soviet experts, a new work method and style gradually developed. First of all, everyone, from top to bottom, grasped the main link of the railway – transportation. Du Larasov, the deputy director of the sub-bureau, spent half of his time leading transportation every day, and the transportation situation of the whole day could be understood in the evening, which was eleven hours earlier than in the past. The director of the sub-bureau personally took the lead in launching a movement of 2,000 people from the stations under his jurisdiction to find sources of goods. As a result, with fewer people, work efficiency actually improved. In this way, surplus labor was invested in other constructive production units of the railway.
    The excellent work style of Soviet experts is built on the basis of their conscious absolute responsibility for the tasks assigned by the state. Therefore, they always maintain the spirit of continuing to study shortcomings and strictly conducting criticism and self-criticism in their work. At the board meetings of the Chinese Changchun Railway, when Grunichev, the chief of the railway bureau and major general of the engineering corps, gave a work report, many councilors and advisors at the rank of colonel could ask questions at any time or offer strict criticism; at the same time, they also put forward suggestions for improvement and solutions to problems at the meeting.
    Grunichev often went deep into workshops and factories. When this gray-haired and experienced bureau chief suddenly appeared in the Harbin Locomotive Depot, Chinese employees rushed to ask him for advice. With his two hands stained with engine oil, he opened the lid of the first locomotive and, finding a small spot of rust, said seriously: "It must be wiped as bright as a mirror, and there must not be a small spot of rust!" Then he nervously checked the remaining five locomotives. When he saw that the remaining five locomotives were all shiny and wiped like a mirror, he became very happy again.
    The rich experience and excellent work style of Soviet experts brought to the workshops and factories stimulated the labor creativity of the Chinese working class. Sun Shaoxian, a vehicle inspector at the Shenyang Vehicle Inspection Section, after learning the assembly line operation method suitable for Soviet factories, created a horizontal operation method for freight cars suitable for the vehicle inspection section. After learning advanced Soviet experience, Tian Guangtai and Wan Jingchang, two workers at the Harbin Telecommunications Section, created the Luning-style method of adding fire to run copper to eliminate machine wear, extending the life of the machine.
    Under the guidance of advanced Soviet experience, accidents on the Chinese Changchun Railway have been reduced by half. In particular, as a result of promoting 42 famous advanced experiences of Soviet railways, including the "500-kilometer" movement, in the car, locomotive, engineering, and electrical departments, the Chinese Changchun Railway, which accounts for only one-quarter of the total length of the Northeast Railway lines but bears a large transportation volume, is like a machine. From the board of directors and the administration bureau to the sections, stations, and trains, every unit and even every individual is playing its due role and continuously improving transportation efficiency. Today, the Chinese Changchun Railway has begun to appear in the Northeast with a vibrant and new look, just as everyone wished at the first board meeting of the railway: "It will become an advanced enterprise of the People's Republic of China!"

　　一条模范铁路在成长
    ——记苏联专家协助下的中长铁路
    洪流
    一九五○年四月二十五日，中苏合办中国长春铁路公司成立。这是中国铁路史上的一件大事。世界上那里有一个国家像苏联这样愿为此支出一千五百个专家的巨额津贴费来帮助我国建设一条模范铁路，而又最迟不得超过两年半就要将铁路和公司所有的一切财产交给我国？每一个来中长路的苏联专家都在说：“斯大林告诉我们：要在两年半内把技术和管理企业的本领教会中国同志！”
    苏联专家给中长路带来了一片新气象。
    今年八、九月中，中长全路正开展着一个迎接国庆纪念的竞赛热潮。从满洲里到绥芬河，从哈尔滨到大连的繁密的大小车站和各工场、车间门口，贴满了为迎接中华人民共和国第一个国庆日而保证完成生产财务计划的挑战书、应战书。中国工人阶级的高度劳动热忱和苏联先进经验相结合的结果，在这里产生了许多突破过去生产纪录的奇迹！国庆节前两日举行的中长路局的电话会议，总结了这次劳动竞赛的成绩：装车数等十六个竞赛条件有十四个超过了保证完成的目标，使中长铁路第三季度生产财务计划的规定标准超额完成。
    在铁路管理工作中贯彻经济核算思想，是苏联专家带到中长路来的一个基本特点。经济核算制的贯彻，使中长路的生产和财务管理完全建立在一个科学的先进的基础之上。中长路成立后，苏联专家和我国人员合作，制订了贯彻经济核算原则的中长路八个月生产财务计划，首次为我国铁路树立了积累国家财富的财务观点。在此之前，东北铁路实际上仅有运输计划，而对如何为国家获取利润积累资金的财务观点是模糊的，常常只注意完成任务，很少计算成本。比如沈阳分局有十部汽车，未订生产财务计划前就配备了电焊工一个，旋盘工一个；有十几把茶壶，就配备了焊茶壶的洋铁匠一个。当制订生产财务计划时，苏联专家调查清楚了工作情况，算了一下，就说：“把这些汽车与茶壶，每天焊上打坏了，打坏了再焊上，也不足八小时的工作，剩下的时间叫他们作什么？”他们建议把这些工作交给附近的机务段代作，而把这些人分配到很需要人的地方去。再比如，在没有定生产财务计划前，东北铁路在使用材料上没有标准，各检车段向材料部门要木材都不规定尺寸，结果，有的木材因不够尺寸不能用，成了废材；有的木材尺寸太大，用时要锯掉长达一公尺半，浪费很大。生产财务计划制订以后，检车段向材料部门要木材时就规定尺寸，这样，就减少了浪费。东北铁路过去完成每一件工程时，对它所需要的材料定额和财政预算都没有明确的规定。比如，在生产财务计划没有订以前，工程总队钢梁队为完成某一件工程时，使用着两台工程机车；生产财务计划订定以后，沈阳分局数次通知该队重新向中长局办请求手续，但钢梁队没有理睬，分局就严格执行生产财务计划，停止了机车使用。结果，钢梁队长来责问分局：“你们为什么停车？”分局的人就问队长：“工程总队现在不也是独立的经济核算单位吗？你们完成工程有自己的财务预算，机车有开支，分局不能白供给你们使用，今天应该算钱！”队长被迫自己算计了一下，就只要一台机车了。
    在实行了生产财务计划以后，中长铁路的面貌就焕然一新，全路大小工场车间，都在开始树立一种主人翁思想——经济核算思想。哈尔滨检车段，过去洗油槽车，往往把剩下的油滓放掉了；有了生产财务计划以后，段上就规定了一种制度，在洗油槽车的时候不把油滓放掉，而把它盛在容器里积起来，每次盛起来的油十分之二给工友，十分之八给国家。这样，过去没有用的东西现在又开始成为国家的财富了。
    生产财务计划的实现依靠着一种崭新的制度来保证。这里有这样一个例子：当沈阳分局某段没有焦炭时，分局某负责人就要求管理局批钱去买。管理局认为既然没有焦炭，就会影响工作，当然应该批准。但是当某段人员拿了批准书到材料厂去买时，材料厂的负责人却不同意，认为这是不符合经济核算原则的。生产财务计划是政府批准的，焦炭的价格超过了生产财务计划上的价格，即使是管理局的负责人，也没有权力违背这个计划，而应该自己去想一切办法来获得廉价的焦炭，或者从旁的材料节省出一批钱来，去弥补在购买焦炭时的损失。这样，就把过去只要负责人认为工作需要就可批钱买材料的不合理制度打破了。又如，哈尔滨铁路工厂过去修客车时，把“废木材”分给职工回家当柴火烧；新厂长来后，坚决不同意这样做，当时工会人员就认为新厂长“不关心职工福利”。后来新厂长看到工厂里有个破俱乐部，由于国家财政困难，上级一直没有给钱修，他就把这一批“废木材”用去修理俱乐部，把俱乐部修得像新的一样。职工们有了娱乐的场所了，这才觉得过去把它当柴火烧是浪费，因而非常赞佩新厂长的办法。
    当我们有的同志问，为什么要这样一分一元的节省呢？苏联同志回答说：“英美等帝国主义国家是依靠掠夺殖民地起家的，它们的工业发展曾经过了一百年的时间。但是苏联工业的发展从第一个五年计划到苏联战争一共才十几年，却已赶上英美一百年的发展，它的资本积累是从那里来的呢？就是依靠工人积极性和各企业一元一分地节省得来的。中国是一个新民主主义的国家，他的经济的恢复和发展，也就要走这条节约的道路。”
    一种先进的管理企业的方法和合理的工作制度是需要科学的工作作风来保证贯彻的。苏联专家帮助我国建设中长路的另一个特点是发扬共产主义高尚的品质与丰富的技术业务经验相结合的优良的工作作风，这在实际工作中同样具有重要的意义。比如，当原先有一千五百人的沈阳铁路管理局改组为分局时，业务量减少不多，但人员却减缩至二百零七名，许多中国职工开始时没信心，仍然留恋着一套旧的工作方式和作风，抓不住当前最主要的工作中心，喜欢许多工作一齐布置，喜欢一把抓，喜欢办文书，讲话爱绕大弯子等。曾经有这样一件事：有一次，一个苏联专家走进办公室，看见一个中国同志在和一个干部谈话，谈了很久很久，话总是谈不完，苏联专家问翻译：“他们是老朋友？”翻译说：“不是！”苏联专家问：“是谈重要工作？”翻译又说：“不是。”当苏联专家最后明白了他们两人是初次见面，而且是在谈一件简单的工作时，这才惊讶地说：“这不是两句话就能讲明白的吗？”这种不讲究工作效率的拖拉的农村作风曾一度阻碍了中长路工作的迅速开展。先进的业务经验，新的科学制度有了，但是做工作的人却依然是老作风，当天的事自然办不完。有些人喊：“中长成立了，人减少，事没减，受不了！”苏联专家说：“人少了没问题，开始混乱，过些时候就可以走上正规！”苏联专家就早来、晚走、夜值班，有的还带病工作。这样，在苏联专家的影响下，一种新的工作方法和作风，遂逐渐地培养起来。首先，上下一致抓住铁路主要的环节——运输。分局副局长杜拉索夫每天以一半时间领导运输，全天运输情况晚上就能了解，比过去提早了十一小时。分局长亲自带头发动所辖各站二千人找货源运动，结果，人少了，工作效能反而提高。这样，多余的劳动力又投入了铁路其他建设性的生产单位。
    苏联专家的优良的作风是建筑在他们自觉的对国家付给的任务绝对负责的基础上的。因之，他们对自己的工作始终保持继续研究缺点、严格进行批评和自我批评的精神。在中长路理事会上，该路局长机务中将格鲁尼切夫作工作报告时，许多校级的理事和顾问都可以随时追问，或提出严格的批评；同时也在会上提出改进意见和解决问题的办法。
    格鲁尼切夫经常深入车间、工场。当这位头发已经花白经验丰富的局长突然在哈尔滨机车库出现时，中国职工都纷纷跑拢去请他指教。他用两只染满机油的手掀开了头一部机车的盖子，发现一小点锈，即认真地说：“要擦得镜子一样亮，不能让它有一小点锈的！”接着他又紧张地检查其余五辆机车。当他看见其余五辆机车都亮晶晶擦得像镜子一样的时候，他又变得很高兴了。
    苏联专家的丰富经验与优良作风带到车间、工场，激发着中国工人阶级的劳动创造性。沈阳检车段的检车工孙绍先学习了苏联工厂适用的检修流水作业法后，创造了适合检车段用的货车横作业法。哈尔滨电务段田广泰、万景长两工友在学习了苏联先进经验后，创造了鲁宁式的加火跑铜消灭机件磨耗办法，延长了机器寿命。
    中长路在苏联先进经验指导下，事故减少了一半。特别是包括“五百公里”运动在内的四十二种苏联铁路著名先进经验，在车、机、工、电各部门推行的结果，使这条仅仅占东北铁路线总延长四分之一但却担负了很大运输量的中长路，像一架机器，从理事会、管理局到段站、列车，每一单位甚至每一个人都在发挥着自己应有的作用，并不断提高着运输效率。今天，中长路已经开始以生气勃勃的崭新的面貌出现在东北，正如该路首届理事会议上大家所预祝的：“它将成为中华人民共和国的先进的企业！”
