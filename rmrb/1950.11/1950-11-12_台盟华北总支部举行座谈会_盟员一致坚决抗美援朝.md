Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, North China Branch, Holds Forum
　  League Members Unanimously Resolutely Resist America and Aid Korea

　　[Our Newspaper News] The North China Branch of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League held a forum for all its members on the 5th of this month. They unanimously supported the joint declaration issued by various democratic parties. At the forum, Lin Kengsheng, Chairman of the League Branch, first read the joint declaration and reported and explained the spirit of the declaration, calling on all League members to unanimously support the just demands of the people of the whole country and to support the just war of the Korean people with practical actions and all their strength. At the same time, he emphasized: "Now that the enemy has blatantly reached our national borders, the sabotage and espionage activities of the reactionaries will inevitably intensify. Therefore, all League members should heighten their vigilance and work harder to prevent espionage and oppose traitors.” All League members expressed their determination to support the just demands of the people of the whole country with all their strength, and believed that aiding the Korean people is not only a moral responsibility, but also a necessary step to defend the security of the motherland's territory.

　　During the forum, all League members unanimously pointed out that many concrete facts prove that the blatant manifestation of the American imperialists' aggressive ambitions is the first step towards their doom, and that final victory will surely belong to the just Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world.

　　Finally, Yang Weili, a member of the General Branch Committee, summarized today's forum and called on every League member to contribute all their strength to the sacred tasks of aiding Korea, liberating Taiwan, and defending the motherland, without fearing any sacrifice or difficulty!
