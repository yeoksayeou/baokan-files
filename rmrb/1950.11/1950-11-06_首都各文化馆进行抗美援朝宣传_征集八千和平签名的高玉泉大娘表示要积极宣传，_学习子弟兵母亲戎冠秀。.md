　　Capital Cultural Centers Conduct Anti-American, Aid-Korea Propaganda
    Granny Gao Yuquan, Who Collected Eight Thousand Peace Signatures, Expresses Her Determination to Actively Propagandize and Learn from Mother Rong Guanshou of the Soldiers.
    [Our Newspaper] The movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country is increasingly unfolding among the citizens of the capital. Many workers, citizens, and housewives have participated in current affairs discussions at various cultural centers—their usual places for learning and entertainment—denouncing the aggression and atrocities of American imperialism, and expressing their determination to support the Korean people and defend their country. Such gatherings have been held at the Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Cultural Centers.
    Holding Meetings to Denounce American Imperialist Atrocities
    Voluntarily Aiding the Korean People
    More than fifty students from the political class of the Adult Literacy School at the Third Cultural Center, at a forum held on October 30 to denounce American imperialist atrocities and discuss current affairs, heard Fu Changchun denounce: “In the spring of 1947, American soldiers living at the Xinkai Road intersection in Dongdan often set off firecrackers (double bangs) horizontally on the road, deliberately to startle Chinese pedestrians on the road. They scared people into running away with their heads in their arms, while the American soldiers laughed.” Liu Ziyu denounced: “One afternoon in the winter of 1946, an American devil's truck outside Xizhimen's Baishi Bridge ignored the traffic police's instructions and ran over an old man in his fifties who was pushing a cart and selling cabbage, killing him in the big ditch.” Zhang Xiaoqian said: “In the autumn of 1945, I was selling scenic photographs at the Dong'an Market, originally one yuan per set, but the American devils forcibly took ten sets for one yuan. That wasn't all; several American soldiers also stole forty more sets from me. When I grabbed them, they took out their guns and said: ‘Do you want this?’” Ma Hongchao said: “In front of the American consulate in Dongjiaomin Lane, American devils and British devils often made fun of us Chinese. One day, I saw an American journalist holding a Chinese person's head under his arm. A British consul kicked him from behind and cursed the Chinese as their foreign slaves.” Many students also competed to denounce American soldiers' trucks running over students at the entrance of Rongxian Hutong, and running over tricycle workers and children at Xinjiekou, and so on.
    These endless debts of blood have greatly aroused hatred for American imperialism. Everyone unanimously expressed the need for American imperialism to repay our blood debts. Liu Ziyu said: “We must defend our motherland. Even if we give our personal lives, we must smash the imperialist aggression.” Zhou Ruiming said: “We must stand with the Korean people and never allow imperialism to kill our neighbors.” Jia Yuzhi said: “America's aggression against Korea is to invade China. We must awaken the people of the whole country to thoroughly eliminate imperialism.” Zhao Siwei of the Third Cultural Center said: “Now my eldest child is working in the Fourth Field Army. If American imperialism dares to invade us, I am ready to send my second child, and even my third child, to the forefront of the motherland at any time!” At a forum on the Korean issue held by the Fifth Cultural Center on October 31, sanitation worker Wang Zhiqing said: “In the past, who looked up to us who pulled earth carts? We had no fixed salary, no food, no drink, wearing ragged clothes, living in dilapidated huts, and sometimes even sleeping in people's doorways. Today, after liberation, the lives of the sanitation team brothers have improved, and they are also participating in learning, from being illiterate to being able to write notes and letters home.” He patted the shoulder of a brother sitting next to him and said: “New uniforms have been put on! We will never allow the oppression of the rulers to return! We are willing to dedicate everything to kick the American imperialists out!”
    The Fourth Cultural Center has recently received many letters from citizens requesting that they be forwarded to the government and newspapers, unanimously advocating taking practical actions to aid the Korean people. The collective opinion of 207 people in the political class of the center stated: "We are all peace-loving, and we have all signed the Stockholm Appeal. However, when peace is being destroyed by American imperialism, when American imperialism uses the bombing of Korean women and children to answer our calls for peace, especially when the sharp knife of American imperialism is stabbing us, our peace cannot be limited to appeals. We must use all our strength to stop American imperialist aggression, and we must use all our strength to ensure the peace we need!" Veteran soldier Jin Rui and housewife Zhong Rulin, along with eight others, listed the facts of American aggression against us in their letter, saying: "This is tolerable, but what is intolerable?" We should give all possible practical assistance to the Korean people. We should immediately organize volunteer troops to go to aid, thoroughly defeat the American imperialists' despicable dream of first destroying Korea and then destroying our country; protect our motherland and protect our homes from invasion.
    Cadres and teachers of the Third Cultural Center's Adult Literacy School Hong Weicai, Liu Deyuan, Zhang Zhaoxiang, Guo Shiying, Xuan Huaiyuan, Ma Fushan, Zhou Xiuling, Ma Chengshu, Zhang Kezhuang, Yao Peiren, Lu Jiandong, Zhao Zhonglin, Wang Hanzhang, Sun Shurong, Zhao Siwei, Lu Jinwen, Ma Wenbo, as well as all 45 students in the advanced class, all 29 students in the intermediate class, all 27 students in the elementary class A, all 29 students in the elementary class B, and all 46 students in the political class also jointly signed their names, expressing their determination to defeat American imperialism.
    Preparing to Launch Propaganda to Relatives and Neighbors
    Paying Attention to Secret Agents and Crushing Rumors
    At the forum convened by the Third Cultural Center on October 30, everyone also believed that not only should we arm ourselves ideologically, but we must also mobilize others to arm themselves ideologically. At the forum convened by the Fourth Cultural Center, it was unanimously agreed to take on the responsibility of propaganda, explaining the atrocities of American imperialist aggression to relatives, friends, and neighbors, and paying attention to the activities of secret agents, exposing and crushing secret agent rumors.
    Housewives Hate American Imperialism
    Not Afraid of War for the Sake of Peace
    Many housewives have also expressed their determination to resist American imperialist aggression. The preparatory meetings of the women's federations in the Second and Fifth Districts discussed the issue of resisting America and aiding Korea. The preparatory committee of the Fifth District Women's Federation also wrote to Chairman Mao, reporting on the progress made and the democratic rights obtained in the year since liberation, saying: We women love peace the most. But we know that when aggressive wars cannot be stopped by peaceful means, we are not afraid of war. It also said: The facts of imperialist aggression and oppression against China are like a clear and distinct running account in the minds of the common people. It cannot be erased or wiped away. Now the United States is following the old path of Japanese aggression against China, attacking Korea and bombing the Northeast. We can no longer tolerate it, we must resist America and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country! Zhang Gengze, a 54-year-old granny from the Second District, said: "Weapons cannot determine the victory or defeat of war. We old women must work hard to propagandize for a long time, so that everyone knows the crimes of American imperialism." Granny Gao Yuquan, who had initiated the collection of over eight thousand peace signatures, slapped the table and said: "This time, I still want to actively propagandize in the same way. I simply get furious when I hear the name of the American devils! Why haven't we quickly aided Korea?! Don't think I'm over fifty years old, if needed, I can go to the front line and do anything, at least I can learn from Rong Guanshou, the mother of the soldiers! As long as I live for one day, I will do my best to tell every Chinese person about the crimes of the 'devil' American imperialism!"

　　首都各文化馆进行抗美援朝宣传
    征集八千和平签名的高玉泉大娘表示要积极宣传，  学习子弟兵母亲戎冠秀。
    【本报讯】抗美援朝保家卫国运动，在首都市民中日益展开。很多工人、市民、家庭妇女，在他（她）们平常学习、娱乐的场所——各个文化馆，参加了时事座谈，控诉美帝侵略暴行，表示了支援朝鲜人民，保家卫国的决心。这样的集会，第二、第四、第五、第六等文化馆都曾举行过。
    开会控诉美帝暴行
    志愿援助朝鲜人民
    第三文化馆成人补习学校政治班五十多位同学，在十月三十日举行的控诉美帝暴行及时事讨论座谈会上，傅长春控诉说：“一九四七年春，住在东单新开路口的美国兵经常在马路上横着放爆竹（双响），故意来崩马路上的中国行人。把人们吓得抱头乱跑，美兵却在一边哈哈大笑。”刘子玉控诉说：“一九四六年冬天有一个下午，美国鬼子大卡车在西直门外白石桥不听路警的指挥，把一个推车卖白菜的五十多岁的老人撞死到大沟里。”张孝千说：“一九四五年秋天，我在东安市场卖风景照片，本是一元一套，美国鬼子一元硬拿十套。这还不算，几个美国兵还偷了我四十多套。我抓住他们，他们就拿出手枪来说：‘你要这个的’”。马宏焯说：“东交民巷美国领事馆门前，美国鬼子和英国鬼子常拿我们中国人开玩笑。有一天，我看见一个美国新闻记者用胳膊夹着中国人的脑袋。有一个英国领事用脚在后边踢，还骂中国人是他们的洋奴。”很多同学都争着控诉美国兵卡车在绒线胡同口轧死学生，在新街口轧死三轮工人和小孩等。
    这些说不完的血债，都大大激起了对美帝国主义的愤恨。大家都一致表示要美帝国主义偿还我们的血债。刘子玉说：“我们要保卫我们的祖国。付出我们个人的生命，也要粉碎帝国主义的侵略。”周瑞明说：“我们要和朝鲜人民站在一起，决不允许帝国主义来杀害我们的邻人。”贾月志说：“美国侵略朝鲜，就是要来侵略中国。我们要唤醒全国人民起来彻底消灭帝国主义。”第三文化馆赵四维说：“现在我的大孩子在第四野战军工作。美帝国主义胆敢侵略我们，我准备随时把我第二个孩子，甚至第三个孩子送到祖国的最前线！”第五文化馆十月三十一日召开的朝鲜问题座谈会上，清洁队工人王治清说：“从前我们拉土车的，有谁看得起？没有固定的薪金，吃不上，喝不上，穿着破衣服，住在坍塌的破屋子里，甚至有时睡在人家的大门洞里。解放后的今天，清洁队的兄弟们生活都好起来了，还参加学习，从大字不识到能写便条写家信。”他拍着坐在身旁的兄弟的肩膀说：“里面新制服也穿上了！我们决不容许统治者的压迫再回来！我们愿献身一切，把美帝踢出去！”
    第四文化馆近来接连收到好多市民的意见书，要求转给政府和报社一致坚决主张以实际行动援助朝鲜人民。该馆政治班二百零七人集体意见书上说：“我们都是爱好和平的，我们都在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。但是，当和平正被美帝破坏着的时候，当美帝用轰炸朝鲜妇女儿童来回答我们的和平呼吁的时候，尤其美帝的尖刀正往我们身上刺的时候，对我们和平不能仅止于呼吁，我们应用尽一切力量来制止美帝的侵略，我们应用尽一切的力量来确保我们所需要的和平！”复员军人金瑞及家庭妇女仲儒林等八人在意见书上列举了美国对我侵略的事实后说：“是可忍，孰不可忍！”我们应以实际的一切援助给予朝鲜人民。我们应该即刻组织志愿军，前往援助，彻底的打垮美帝先灭亡朝鲜后灭亡我国的卑鄙残梦；保护我们的祖国，保护我们的家园不受侵犯。
    第三文化馆干部和成人补习学校教职员洪维才、刘德元、张兆祥、郭士英、宣怀远、马富山、周秀玲、马承淑、张克庄、姚培仁、卢建东、赵钟林、王汉章、孙叔容、赵四维，路锦雯、马文波及高级班全体同学四十五人、中级班全体同学二十九人、初级甲班全体同学二十七人、初级乙班全体同学二十九人、政治班全体同学四十六人也联合签名，表示要坚决打垮美国帝国主义。
    准备向亲邻展开宣传
    留心特务并粉碎谣言
    在第三文化馆十月三十日召开的座谈会上，大家还认为不但我们自己要在思想上武装起来，而且要动员别人也都在思想上武装起来。第四文化馆召开的座谈会上，并一致同意负起宣传责任，向亲朋、邻舍说明美帝侵略暴行，并留心特务活动，揭发与粉碎特务造谣。
    家庭妇女痛恨美帝
    为了和平不怕战争
    很多家庭妇女也纷纷表示了反抗美帝侵略的决心。二区、五区妇联筹委会成立会上，都讨论了抗美援朝问题。五区妇联筹委会还上书毛主席，在报告了解放后一年来的进步和得到的民主权利以后说：我们妇女是最爱好和平的。可是我们知道用和平的办法制止不了侵略战争时，我们并不害怕战争。又说：帝国主义侵略压迫中国的事实，在老百姓的脑子里，像一笔清清楚楚的流水账。它是抹不去、擦不掉的。现在美国又照着日本侵略中国的老路，来进攻朝鲜，轰炸东北。我们再也不能容忍了，我们要抗美援朝，保家卫国！二区五十四岁的张庚泽大娘说：“武器是不能决定战争的胜败的，咱老太婆要长期地努力作宣传，让每一个人都知道美帝的罪行。”曾发动过八千多人和平签名的高玉泉大娘拍着桌子说：“这一次，我还是要照样积极宣传。我简直一听到美国鬼子这个名字，就气透了！干啥咱们还不赶紧援助朝鲜哩？！别看我五十多岁，一旦需要的话，上前线也能干，啥都作得了，起码可以学学子弟兵的母亲戎冠秀！只要我活上一天，我就要竭尽全力把‘鬼子’美帝国主义的罪行告诉每一个中国人！”（刘德元、洪维才、四馆通讯组、王凡）
