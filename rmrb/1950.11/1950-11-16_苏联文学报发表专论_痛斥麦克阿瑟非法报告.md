Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 15th: The Soviet *Literary Gazette* published an editorial on the 11th entitled "What Austin Didn't Say," fiercely denouncing MacArthur's provocative and illegal report to the Security Council. The newspaper also published three photographs showing four peaceful Chinese residents wounded by American aircraft, as well as Chinese railway workers and farmers gathering to protest American aggressors.

The editorial stated: MacArthur, the executioner of the Korean people, attempting to "find a basis" for American intervention in Korea and American aggression against free China, submitted a special report to the Security Council accusing the People's Republic of China of "aggression."

The American representative, Austin, read out this provocative document to the United Nations Security Council meeting in an almost tearful voice. If you listen to MacArthur, it is as if the American interventionists have not occupied Taiwan, American bombers have not violated the border of the People's Republic of China day and night, have not massacred peaceful residents, and have not dropped bombs on peaceful cities and villages; on the contrary, look, it is the Chinese people's army that "threatens" the "security" of the American interventionists.

But facts speak louder than words. The fact is that American imperialists launched war actions in Korea and are always trying to expand the war and extend their aggression to the territory of the People's China.

The Americans' criminal provocations began in August, and despite repeated protests from the Chinese government, the criminal provocations continue to this day, with dozens of people killed and wounded by American bullets and bombs. However, Austin's lengthy and malicious speech and MacArthur's lengthy report completely avoided mentioning this.

The Chinese people express deep anger at these criminal actions, MacArthur's ridiculous slanders, and Austin's malicious attacks. The Chinese working people have demanded in many meetings that the adventurous American bandits be stopped. The working people of free China have declared that they cannot tolerate the invasion of their motherland's borders.

　　苏联文学报发表专论
    痛斥麦克阿瑟非法报告
    【新华社莫斯科十五日电】苏联《文学报》于十一日以“奥斯汀所没有说的”为题，发表专论，痛斥麦克阿瑟向安全理事会提出挑衅性的非法报告。该报同时并刊出了三张显示四位中国和平居民为美机所伤及中国铁路员工与农民集会抗议美国侵略者的照片。
    专论写道：朝鲜人民的刽子手麦克阿瑟力图为美国干涉朝鲜及美国侵略自由中国的行动“找出根据”，就向安理会提出了一份特别报告，控告中华人民共和国的“侵略”。
    美国代表奥斯汀在联合国安理会会议上，用几乎是哭泣的声音宣读了这份挑衅性的文件。如果听一听麦克阿瑟的话，那就好像美国干涉者没有占领台湾，美国轰炸机没有日夜侵犯中华人民共和国边境，没有屠杀和平居民而且没有向和平的城市和乡村投弹，而相反地，你看，反而是中国人民的军队“威胁”美国干涉者的“安全”。
    但是事实胜于雄辩。事实是美帝国主义者在朝鲜发动战争行动，随时都力图扩大战争，把他们的侵略扩大到人民中国的领土上去。
    美国人的罪恶挑衅在八月间就已经开始，而且不顾中国政府的一再抗议，至今罪恶的挑衅仍在继续，已有数十人被美国的子弹和炸弹打死打伤。然而，奥斯汀的冗长而又邪恶的演说以及麦克阿瑟的长篇报告，却竟对此避而不谈。
    中国人民对这些罪恶行动、麦克阿瑟的无聊诽谤、奥斯汀的邪恶攻击，深表愤怒，中国劳动人民在许多会议上要求制止冒险的美国匪徒。自由中国的劳动人民已宣布他们决不能忍受他们祖国的边疆遭受侵犯。
