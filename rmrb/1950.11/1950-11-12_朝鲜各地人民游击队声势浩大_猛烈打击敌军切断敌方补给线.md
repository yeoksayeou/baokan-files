　　People's Guerrilla Warfare Vigorous Throughout Korea
　　Fiercely Attacking Enemy Troops and Cutting Enemy Supply Lines
	East Coast
	[Xinhua News Agency, 10th] Powerful Korean People's Guerrilla forces are launching fierce attacks in the enemy-occupied areas of the East Coast, inflicting severe blows on the American invaders and the Syngman Rhee puppet army. In the area north of Wonsan, according to International News Service reporter Li Qi on the 8th: "Large, well-organized armed communists, on the night of the 6th and the early morning of the 7th, cut off the supply and railway lines between Wonsan and Hamhung near Yonghung. Twenty trucks were ambushed, a train was derailed, and six 155mm howitzers were destroyed. Field artillery battalion commander Eddie stated: 'A powerful enemy force attacked his troops in Yonghung at around 3:00 AM on the 7th. They captured the outpost... charged into our defenses... and used mortars to attack our parking lot, causing many casualties due to mortar and artillery explosions.'" According to United Press International, Wonsan, 7th: A spokesman for the US 10th Corps also admitted that Korean People's Guerrilla forces, only twenty miles north of Wonsan, shot at American trains and motor convoys, causing "heavy casualties" to the US Marine guards on the train, and burning and destroying several vehicles of the nearby motor convoy.

　　Powerful People's Guerrilla forces are also active in the area west of Wonsan. According to United Press International: A battalion of the US Marine Corps First Division was "cut off" by the People's Guerrilla forces near Majon-ri, seventeen miles west of Wonsan. According to the Associated Press, another unit of the division attempted to rescue this "lost battalion" on the evening of the 7th, but encountered a People's Guerrilla "ambush" as soon as it advanced to the mountainous area called "Nightmare Valley," "suffering considerable casualties."

　　Even the Wonsan Airport occupied by the US military was attacked by People's Guerrilla forces during the day. On the 6th, when an American plane was flying low to land at the airport, it was simultaneously fired upon by about two hundred guerrillas lying on the ground near the airport, causing the plane to be "riddled with bullets" (Associated Press).

　　People's Guerrilla forces are also very active in the area centered on Kilju, extending north to Myongchon and south to Songjin. According to United Press International, Songjin, 8th: "Crazy daredevils are roaming the countryside, looking for targets to fight." The People's Guerrilla forces between Kilju and Songjin "rushed down from the steep mountains" on the night of the 4th, seizing five trucks of military supplies from the Syngman Rhee puppet army. On the night of the 6th, the puppet army artillery squadron occupying Kilju was attacked by People's Guerrilla forces. Under the overwhelming momentum of the guerrillas, the Syngman Rhee puppet army and its American advisors were terrified and behaved absurdly. Song Yang-cheon (transliteration), the commander of the puppet Kyoto Division, who served as a Japanese military officer during the Japanese rule of Korea, was very afraid of the local people's heroic fighting spirit against the invaders. He expressed "great hesitation" in moving his headquarters to the Kilju-Myongchon area. United Press International also stated: The American military advisors in the Syngman Rhee puppet army in this area are "not only fighting to save their lives, but also waging a war of nerves," "their white hair is increasing day by day." The Syngman Rhee puppet army officers and American advisors "have changed from extreme arrogance to caution." The Syngman Rhee puppet army is not only afraid of attacks by the People's Guerrilla forces, but also faces the threat of a counterattack by the People's Army. Therefore, "security posts have been doubled, all the troops dare not sleep soundly, luggage has been packed, and weapons are in hand," ready to escape at any time.

　　[Xinhua News Agency, 11th] Powerful Korean People's Guerrilla forces are active in the vast enemy-occupied areas of central and southern Korea, threatening the enemy's important transportation lines, containing a large number of American invaders and Syngman Rhee puppet troops, and giving them a powerful blow.

	Central
　　In the central region, powerful People's Guerrilla forces are spread from the east coast to the west coast. According to a message from the US Eighth Army headquarters in Korea by an International News Service reporter on the 9th: Thousands of Korean People's Guerrilla forces are attacking 110 nautical miles behind enemy lines, tying down "almost a full division" of US and Syngman Rhee puppet troops. Fighting has been going on in the areas of Icheon and Cheorwon for several days. The US Eighth Army headquarters revealed that the People's Guerrilla forces declared they would liberate the important railway junction of Cheorwon, 50 miles northeast of Seoul, as well as important towns such as Gimhwa and Uncheon-ri. From these cities, the People's Guerrilla forces can attack enemy operations north of the 38th parallel and cut off transportation lines. The People's Guerrilla forces attacked a part of the Syngman Rhee puppet army's 17th Regiment in the Cheorwon area. Another unit of the People's Guerrilla forces in the area launched a fierce attack on Otang-ri (transliteration) between Icheon and Pyongyang, northwest of Cheorwon, and occupied the area. The US 25th Division troops reinforcing Icheon from the southwest were also intercepted near Munni-ri (transliteration), 11 miles from Icheon. Another unit of the US 25th Division was tied down in the area north of Kaesong. Further west, according to US intelligence personnel, there are "large concentrations" of People's Guerrilla forces in the area extending into the Yellow Sea, 25 miles west of Sariwon, tying down the 187th Regiment of the US 11th Airborne Division.

　　On the east coast, the Korean People's Guerrilla forces are exceptionally active between Wonsan and Yonghung. According to a spokesman for MacArthur Headquarters on the 10th, the People's Guerrilla forces control the villages between Wonsan and Yonghung, constantly destroying bridges and cutting off enemy military transportation. The enemy occupying the area is frequently attacked.

	Southern
　　In southern Korea, the People's Guerrilla forces are also launching widespread attacks, threatening the invaders' main supply lines. According to Reuters, Tokyo: On the 8th, "Guerrilla warfare suddenly erupted along the main supply line from Busan to Seoul." Near Daegu, Waegwan, and Daejeon, the People's Guerrilla forces engaged in combat with the Syngman Rhee puppet army's Third Corps. In Namwon, a key transportation hub in the southwest, the People's Guerrilla forces also raided the Syngman Rhee puppet army.

　　[Xinhua News Agency, 10th] TASS News Agency: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Democratic Republic announced on the 9th that the People's Army troops continue to actively fight the US military and the South Korean army on all fronts.

　　On the Cheongcheon River, the People's Army troops continue to fight the US military.

　　On the east coast, fighting is taking place north of Hamhung and in the Kilju area.

　　[Xinhua News Agency, 11th] TASS News Agency: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Democratic Republic announced on the 10th that the People's Army troops on all fronts are fighting the US military and the Syngman Rhee puppet army in their original positions.

　　朝鲜各地人民游击队声势浩大
　  猛烈打击敌军切断敌方补给线
            东海岸
    【新华社十日讯】强大的朝鲜人民游击队正在东海岸敌后地区展开猛烈活动，使美国侵略者及李承晚伪军到处遭受严重打击。在元山以北地区，据国际新闻社记者李奇八日报道：“大股组织良好的武装共军，在六日夜晚到七日清晨，在永兴附近切断了元山和咸兴之间的补给线和铁路线。二十部卡车遭到伏击，火车出了轨，六门口径一五五公厘的大炮被毁。野战炮兵营长艾迪称：一支强大的敌军在七日清晨三点钟左右在永兴向他的部队进攻。“他们攻克了前哨站，……冲进了我们的防线……又用迫击炮攻打我们的停车厂，由于迫击炮和炮弹引起的爆炸而使我们死伤多人。’”另据合众社元山七日讯：美第十兵团发言人也承认，朝鲜人民游击队在元山以北仅二十英里处，射击美国火车及汽车运输队，使火车上的美国海军陆战队卫兵遭受“重大死伤”，并把附近的汽车运输队的若干车辆烧毁与击毁。
    在元山以西地区，也活跃着强大的人民游击队。据合众社报道：美国海军陆战队第一师有一个营被人民游击队“切断”在元山以西十七英里的马转里附近。据美联社称，该师另部于七日晚企图前往援救这个“丢了的营”，但刚前进到名为“梦魔谷”的山地，又遇到人民游击队的“伏击”，“遭受了相当多的伤亡”。
    就连美军所侵占的元山飞机场，在白天也遭受到人民游击队的袭击。六日当一架美国飞机在该机场低飞降落时，在机场附近遭到约两百个躺在地上的游击队员同时开枪射击，使该机“中弹累累”（美联社）。
    在以吉州为中心，北到明川南到城津的地区内，人民游击队也十分活跃。据合众社城津八日电称：“疯狂的敢死队流窜四乡，寻找战斗的目标”。吉州与城津间的人民游击队，曾于四日夜间“从险峻的山里一拥而下”，缴获了李伪军五辆卡车的军火。六日夜晚，侵占吉州的伪军炮兵中队又遭受人民游击队的袭击。在游击队的浩大声势下，李伪军及其美国顾问们十分恐慌，丑态百出。在日本统治朝鲜时期曾任日军军官的伪京都师师长宋扬川（译音），对于当地人民抗击侵略者的英勇斗志非常害怕，他对于把他的司令部移到吉州明川区表示“十分迟疑”。合众社又称：在这一地区的李伪军中的美国军事顾问们，“不仅在为保全生命而战，而且也在作神经战”，“他们的白发与日俱增”。李伪军军官和美国顾问们“已经从极端的傲慢变为谨慎小心”。李伪军不仅恐惧人民游击队的袭击，而且也面临着人民军反攻的威胁，因此，“保安的岗哨已经加倍，所有的军队都不敢熟睡，行李都已经打好，武器拿在手里”，准备随时逃跑。
    【新华社十一日讯】强大的朝鲜人民游击队，活跃在朝鲜中部和南部的广大敌后地区，威胁着敌人的重要交通线，牵制了美国侵略者及李承晚伪军的大量兵力，并予以有力的打击。
            中部
    在中部，从东海岸到西海岸，遍布着强大的人民游击队。据国际新闻社记者九日发自朝鲜美国第八军总部的消息称：数千朝鲜人民游击队正在敌人前线后面一百一十航空里的地方出击，牵制了美军及李伪军的“差不多满员的一个师”的兵力。战斗已在伊川和铁原一带进行数日。美国第八军总部透露，人民游击队声言要解放汉城东北五十英里的重要铁路交叉点铁原及金化、云川里等重要城镇。从这些城市出发，人民游击队可以打击三八线以北的敌军行动，并切断交通线。人民游击队曾在铁原地区袭击李伪军第十七团的一部分。该地区的另一部人民游击队曾在铁原西北猛攻伊川和平壤之间的沃塘里（译言），并占领该地。由西南向伊川增援的美国第二十五师部队，也在距伊川十一英里的文尼里（译音）附近遭受截击。美国第二十五师的另一支部队，则被牵制在开城以北地区。由此往西，据美国情报人员报告，在沙里院以西二十五英里的伸入黄海的地区，有“大量集中”的人民游击队，牵制着美国第十一空军师的一八七团。
    在东海岸，朝鲜人民游击队在元山与永兴之间异常活跃。据麦克阿瑟总部发言人十日透露，人民游击队控制着元山到永兴之间的村庄，不断破坏桥梁，切断敌人的军事运输，侵占该地区的敌人经常遭受袭击。
            南部
    在朝鲜南部，人民游击队也广泛出击，威胁侵略者的主要补给线。据路透社东京讯：八日，“在釜山至汉城的主要补给线沿线，游击战骤然爆发了”。在大邱、倭馆及大田附近，人民游击队与李伪军第三兵团展开战斗。在西南端的交通要点南原，人民游击队也曾突击李伪军。
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部九日发表战报称：人民军部队在各战线继续与美军和南朝鲜军积极作战。
    在清川江，人民军部队继续与美军进行战斗。
    在东海岸，战斗在咸兴以北和吉州地区进行。
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部十日发表战报称：各线人民军部队在原来的阵地上与美军和李承晚伪军进行战斗。
