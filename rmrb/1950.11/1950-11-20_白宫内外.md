　　Inside and Outside the White House
    By Soviet Artist Yefimov

    This house cannot be said to be: "none of your business." It is precisely the center of all aggressive ideas and all anti-peace conspiracies. This is called – the White House. Former "homeowners" all called it that. Now even Americans are confused about this name. They say, "If this house is white, why does it look brown; and if it is brown, then why does it seem yellow?!"
    The current "homeowner" has not only repainted the house. He has also added a fifth pillar to this four-pillared building. The White House's foreign policy relies on this pillar. (See the picture!) Take a look at the political figures decorating this pillar! Adenauer, Spaak, and other Gestapo figures...
    Here is Guderian. The beaten German fascist general came here to reminisce about his bitter experiences with the local strategists. In the White House, he feels right at home.
    On the "flagpole" of this house, (look again at the picture!) the flag of the United Nations is waving. Mr. Acheson's private secretary and the hypocritical secretary of the United Nations, the "anointed" Lie, raised this flag. From the bloody handprints on the flag, it can be seen that General MacArthur "intervened" in Lie's "peaceful actions."
    Not far from the "flagpole" is the famous "Uncle Tom's Cabin" – the House Un-American Activities Committee. Succeeding the corrupt Republican Thomas is the bribed Democrat Wood, who is quite adept at mastering Himmler's experience here.
    The White House kitchen is very busy. The head chef Marshall and his assistants: Eisenhower and Bradley, smack their lips in praise of the "Cold War" and are quietly preparing for a "hot war."
    Downstairs, Syngman Rhee and Schuman are waiting for their master's orders.
    Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Tingfu are hiding in a corner of the roof. Bao Dai "Emperor," foreseeing his own future, huddles next to these two homeless men.
    In the sound room, a rehearsal of the United Nations General Assembly vote is taking place. The conductor is Acheson. He is satisfied. Here, there is naturally no sound, but the people who echo his words are the most praised!
    Churchill, as a "friend of this (white!) house," is strolling in the yard, smoking a cigar according to his traditional habit, the smoke billowing like a war signal. Following the Conservative Churchill is the "Socialist" Bevin.
    Who is this? Could it be Franco? Yes, the air of a third world war is being released from the White House window, and he is sticking his head out.
    The Pope rushes to pay his respects to Uncle Sam! To be honest, he is worried about what will happen if the war hits his three-layered crown? What if the American Cardinal Spellman, who sells Coca-Cola, comes to take his place?
    In the yard, the ferocious dogs – the hounds – are carefully crawling.
    We walked out of the White House. We did not see all the people in the White House; we did not see all the residents of the White House. In addition to the warmongers at home, there are also warmongers who travel abroad; they are, of course – not at home. Some are wreaking havoc in Korea, some are laying mines on the bridges of the Rhine, some...
    Why can't we meet them! Well, it's not our fault that they are not all at home!

　　白宫内外
    苏联  叶菲莫夫  作
    这所房子不能说是：“跟你无关”。它正是一切侵略思想，一切反和平阴谋的中心。这就叫——白宫。从前的“房主们”都是这样叫它的。现在这个名称连美国人都闹不清楚了。他们说：“如果这所房子是白色的，那为什么看去倒是褐色的呢；如果它是褐色的，那么为什么它却又像是黄色的呢？！”
    现在的“房主”不仅把房子重新漆上了颜色。他还在这所四个圆柱的房屋上，加添第五个柱子。白宫的对外政策就依靠这柱子。（看图！）请看看装饰这个柱子的政治人物吧！阿登纳，斯巴克及其他盖世太保们……
    这儿还有古德林。挨过打的德国法西斯将军来到这儿与当地的战略家们回味自己的辛酸经历。在白宫里，他就像在家中一样。
    在这所房子的“旗杆”上，（再看一次图！）挥动着联合国的旗。艾奇逊先生的私人秘书和联合国的伪善的秘书，“涂了圣油的”赖伊，升起了这面旗。从旗上的血腥手印，可以看出麦克阿瑟将军是“插手”于赖伊的“和平行为”的。
    距“旗杆”不远处，是著名的“汤玛斯叔叔的小屋”——非美活动调查委员会。接替着这个贪污的共和党员汤玛斯的，是受贿的民主党员伍德，他在这儿相当熟练地掌握着希姆来的经验。
    白宫的厨房里——活跃得很。厨子头儿马歇尔和他的助手：艾森豪威尔和布莱得雷都啧啧地赞美着“冷战”，并不动声色地准备着“热战”。
    下房里，李承晚和舒曼正在等候着主子的命令。
    蒋介石和蒋廷黻隐藏在屋顶的一个角落。保大“皇帝”预感到自己的前途，蜷缩在无家可归的这两人旁边。
    在试音室中，正在进行着联合国大会的投票预演。指挥者是艾奇逊。他是满意的。这儿，自然没有声音，但随声附和的人——却也最受赞扬！
    邱吉尔以这所（白色！）“房子的朋友”的资格，在院子里散步，照他那传统的习惯，吸着雪茄，烟幕好像战争信号一般袅绕着。跟在保守党员邱吉尔后边的，是“社会主义者”贝文。
    这是谁？可不是佛朗哥么？是的，从白宫窗子里放出了第三次世界大战的空气，他也就伸出头来。
    罗马教皇赶着来向山姆叔叔致敬！老实说，他正在担心，如果打到他那三层的皇冠上怎么办？如果美国那位贩卖可口可乐的枢机主教斯派尔曼来接替他的位子，又怎么办？
    院子里小心爬着的，是凶恶的狗——猎狗。
    我们走出了白宫。白宫里的人，我们没有全看见；我们没有看到白宫里的全体居住者。除却在家的战争贩子以外，还有出外旅行的战争贩子们；他们，当然是——不会在家。有的正在朝鲜逞凶，有的正在莱茵河的桥上敷设地雷，有的……
    为什么和他们见不着面呢！呶，这不是我们的过错，他们没有全体在家啊！
