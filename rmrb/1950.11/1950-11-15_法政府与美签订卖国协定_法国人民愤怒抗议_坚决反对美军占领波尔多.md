　　Xinhua News Agency, 14th. TASS reports: The French people are angrily protesting the traitorous agreement recently signed between the Pleven government and the United States. According to the agreement signed on November 4th and immediately put into effect, the French government has handed over the two ports of Bordeaux and La Rochelle-La Pallice to the United States for use as supply bases for the US occupation forces in Germany and Austria. According to *l'Humanité*, the United States will station up to 3,000 troops in the two ports. Nine hundred US troops stationed in Germany had already left for France on the 8th, carrying out an actual occupation under the guise of "management." In addition to the above-mentioned agreement, France also signed another secret agreement with the United States, allowing the Americans to build a military highway from Bordeaux through southeastern Paris to the German border near Strasbourg. The road is already under construction by two thousand American technicians and road construction experts.
    This act of the French government in selling out its sovereignty has aroused unparalleled anger among the French people. Six hundred dockworkers and port workers in Bordeaux went on strike for fifteen minutes on the 10th to protest, and all residents of Bordeaux and its suburbs resolutely opposed the US military occupation of the port. Two hundred and fifty farmers, craftsmen, and small business owners in Gironde Province passed a resolution demanding that the US military immediately withdraw from France and declared that "Bordeaux must remain a French seaport." The National Executive Bureau of the "Association of Warriors for Peace and Freedom" called on the French working people to oppose the government's shameful surrender to the United States, pointing out that this surrender is another step in dragging France into war. The association has also organized a delegation to express to the French President the firm will of the French peace fighters to strive for peace and national independence. Communist Party members of the National Assembly, Duby and Cosner, have announced that they will question the government.

　  法国人民愤怒抗议
    坚决反对美军占领波尔多
    【新华社十四日讯】综合塔斯社讯：法国人民愤怒地抗议普利文政府最近与美国签订的卖国协定。根据十一月四日签订而立即生效的协定，法国政府已将波尔多及罗舍尔拉巴利斯两个港口交付美国使用，使之成为美国驻德、奥占领军的给养基地。据人道报报道：美国将在两港驻军达三千人。驻德美军中已有九百人于八日开赴法国，在“管理”的名义下执行实际上的占领任务。在上项已宣布的协定之外，法国还与美国签订了另一密约，准许美国人修筑自波尔多经巴黎东南到达斯特拉斯堡附近德国边境的军用公路。该路并已由两千美国技术人员与筑路专家动工兴修中。
    法国政府这种出卖主权的行径，激起了法国人民无比的愤怒。波尔多港当地的六百名码头工人和港口工人在十日曾停工十五分钟，以示抗议，波尔多及其近郊全体居民都坚决反对美军占领该港。吉伦特省的普及峨有二百五十名农民、工匠和小商人通过决议，要求美军立即撤出法国，并宣称“波尔多必须保持是法国的海港”。“争和平自由战士协会”全国执行局号召法国劳动人民反对政府又一次向美国投降的可耻行为，指出这种投降是使法国卷入战争的又一步骤。该会并已组织代表团，向法总统表示法国和平战士争取和平与民族独立的坚决意志。国民议会共产党议员杜比和高斯纳已宣布将向政府提出质问。
