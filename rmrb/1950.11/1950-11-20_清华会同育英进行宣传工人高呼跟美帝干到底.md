　　Tsinghua University Joins Yuying School in Propaganda Campaign; Workers Shout "Fight to the End with the American Imperialists!"
    [This newspaper reported] Over two hundred students from Tsinghua University set out from the Seventh District Committee on the afternoon of the 19th for a propaganda campaign. They met up with students from Yuying Middle School on Huashi Street after passing through Chongwenmenwai Street. The procession held high portraits of Chairman Mao, and red flags fluttered in the wind; slogans such as "Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend Our Country!", "People of the Whole Country Unite!", "Salute to the Korean People's Army! Salute to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army!", "Launch a Patriotic Production Competition to Resist America and Aid Korea!", "Strengthen Anti-Espionage and Anti-Special Agent Work!" resounded one after another. When they stopped, they used cartoons and maps to explain the history of American imperialist aggression against China to the masses. Among the listeners, an old man nodded repeatedly and said, "That's right!" They also performed two-person comic routines, clapper talk, living newspaper plays, and waist drum dances, which were warmly welcomed by the masses. Workers from the Daxin Weaving Factory gave the procession boiling water and shouted that they would fight to the end with the American imperialists.
    The marching procession did not return until dark. Everyone still did not feel tired and continued to beat gongs and drums in the courtyard, discussing the details of today's propaganda campaign.

　　清华会同育英进行宣传工人高呼跟美帝干到底
    【本报讯】二百多清华大学的同学在十九日下午从七区区委会出发宣传。经过崇文门外大街与育英中学同学在花市大街会合。队伍中高举毛主席像，红色旗帜迎风飘扬；“抗美援朝，保家卫国！”“全国人民团结起来！”“向朝鲜人民军致敬！向中国人民志愿部队致敬！”“为抗美援朝展开爱国的生产竞赛！”“加强防奸防特！”等口号声此起彼落。停下来时，用漫画、地图等给群众讲解美帝侵华史事。听讲群众中，一个老先生连连点头说“对！”并演出双簧、快板、活报剧、腰鼓等，受到群众热烈欢迎。大信织布厂工人给队伍送开水，并高呼要跟美帝干到底。
    游行队伍直至天黑才回来，大家都不感疲倦，仍在院里敲锣打鼓，研究今天宣传的情形。
