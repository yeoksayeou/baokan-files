Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 28th: People from all over Northeast China are writing letters to express their regards to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country. 1,200 people's representatives from all walks of life in Huanggu District, Shenyang City, on behalf of the 170,000 people in the district, wrote in a letter of condolence: "Your victory encourages us. Our workers have launched a patriotic labor emulation drive. Women are rushing to make cotton clothes for you. Cadres, teachers, and students are also intensifying their work in their respective positions. Thousands of Chinese people and Korean people firmly support you." The reading group of the directly subordinate police station of the Beishi District Public Security Bureau said in a letter to the Volunteer Army: "The people of the whole of China and the people of the whole world are watching you. We hope that you and the Korean People's Army will unite more closely and bravely advance side by side to help the Korean people liberate themselves from the iron heel of the American aggressors. We guarantee to do a good job in the rear." Employees of the Municipal Electric Power Bureau, Zhaoxin Pottery Company, and Dongmin Iron Factory all expressed enthusiastically in their letters that they would use labor emulation to support the Volunteer Army. All the students of Class 2, Grade 3 of Shenyang Railway Middle School said in a letter of condolence: "We saved some stationery expenses and bought some towels, soap, and socks to make consolation bags for you. Although our gifts are very meager, our dozens of warm hearts are closely linked with you." All the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers in the Shenhe District said in a letter of condolence: "For the sake of those martyrs who sacrificed their lives under the artillery fire of American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, we hope that you and the Korean People's Army will be as close as brothers and sisters and resolutely eliminate the American aggressors."
    Workers from factories and mines in Songjiang Province and farmers from vast rural areas are also enthusiastically writing letters to express their regards to the Volunteer Army. Liu Zhendong's team from Shuangya Coal Mine reported to the Volunteer Army in a letter that the team's attendance rate reached 100% and expressed that they would use the practical action of "swinging the big pickaxe to dig more coal" to strengthen the country's economic strength and cooperate with the Volunteer Army's heroic anti-aggression struggle. More than 900 people's representatives from Hulan County told the soldiers of the Volunteer Army in a letter that the county's farmers are drying vegetables and organizing stretchers to actively support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The letter also firmly stated that they are ready to put down their hoes and pick up their guns at any time to defend the motherland. All the emancipated farmers in Nanxiangyang Village, Tangyuan County, also wrote letters to express their regards and encourage the Volunteer Army, urging them to "guard the gate and not allow the wolves to enter the house."
    The movement of the people in Heilongjiang, Liaodong, and Dalian and other provinces and cities to write letters to express their regards to the Volunteer Army is being widely launched.
