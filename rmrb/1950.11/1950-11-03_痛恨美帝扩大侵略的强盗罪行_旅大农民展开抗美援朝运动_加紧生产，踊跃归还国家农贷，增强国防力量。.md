　　【This Newspaper News】According to the Lushun-Dalian People's Daily, the flames of anger against the U.S. imperialist robbers' expanded war of aggression have been ignited in the Lushun-Dalian countryside. Farmers everywhere are furious at the bloody aggression of U.S. imperialism. They have held meetings and discussions and written protest letters with the characters they have just learned. They are determined to resist the U.S. imperialists' expanded war of aggression with practical actions such as actively completing autumn plowing, enthusiastically repaying agricultural loans, and saving money.

　　In recent days, more than 534 letters of protest, letters of condolence, letters of determination, and anti-American aggression production and learning plans have come from the countryside. The letters are all filled with hatred for U.S. imperialism. Gao Yongshan, a rural teacher, wrote in a letter of condolence to the compatriots in Andong who were killed and injured by U.S. aircraft strafing: "The bullets of U.S. imperialism have injured your health and lives. We cannot forget this blood debt and will always remember it in our hearts, make full preparations, and avenge you!" Jia Jiwu, a member of the Chinese Communist Party in Huajia Village, Eighth District, Jin County, specially made a personal winter production, work, and study plan, reported it to the district committee, and forwarded it to the newspaper. He said, "I will defend the motherland with active production and leadership in production." Yin Guoxuan, a third-class labor hero of Lushun-Dalian, also wrote in a letter: "American devils are really looking for excrement with a lantern; they are looking for death!" Through discussions, farmers have become more aware of the bloody face of the American robbers. When farmers in Daxinzhaizi Town, a suburb of Dalian, discussed the brutal acts of U.S. imperialism at a civil school, farmer Yu Anqing said with gritted teeth: "This mad dog without heart or lungs – U.S. imperialism – is expanding its war of aggression. I will use my hoe to smash its dog's head and let it die at our hands, so it can taste the power of the Chinese people!" Farmer Guan Hengxin also said: "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we have just straightened our backs, divided the houses, divided the land, and our lives are getting better day by day. Anyone who wants to destroy this life is digging their own grave and looking for death." Women cadres in the entire Eighth District of Jin County, farmers in Bali Village in the suburbs of Jinzhou City, members of the Lian Gongxin Mutual Aid Group in Chashan Village in the Tenth District of Jin County, and all teachers and students of the Central Elementary School in the Sixth District of Jin County have all held discussion meetings. In addition to denouncing the brutal acts of aggression by U.S. imperialism, they all expressed that they would become a hundred times more tense in their respective positions, work hard in production, study, and work, and further improve their vigilance to smash the conspiracies of the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandits and special agents.

　　Turning hatred into strength, the enthusiasm for production among farmers in various places has become even higher in recent days. After the autumn harvest, only 210 mu of land had been plowed in Hougezhenbao Village, a suburb of Dalian City, which has 6,903 mu of land. This time, in order to oppose U.S. imperialist aggression with practical actions, more than 50 farmers in the village have organized themselves to dig up the stubble to ensure the completion of all autumn plowing in the village. Wang Jiachang, a orchard owner in Guojiagou Village, a suburb of Dalian City, has put even more effort into orchard cultivation. In the past, he neglected autumn management of fruit trees, but this year he has bought 50 pieces of bean cake to "feed" the trees and has plowed more than four mu of orchard land. In addition, he bought a large vat of sulfur water, as well as hoes and fertilizers, and prepared all the materials needed for production next year. He said: "Only by doing a good job in production can the country become stronger, the construction of New China will be better, and we will eventually be able to eliminate the war criminals who are infringing on us." In order to strengthen national defense, farmers in Shanhou Village, Tenth District, Jin County, actively repay their agricultural loans. The village of 93 households owed the government a total of 8,430 catties of loan grain. In this anti-American aggression study, the farmers were enlightened and realized that strengthening national defense construction is a powerful guarantee for defeating U.S. imperialist aggression. In just one morning on the 20th, they all paid it up. Old woman Chen Yulan, who is over 50 years old, said: "By paying off my agricultural loan early, I am also contributing to the fight against the American robbers."

　　痛恨美帝扩大侵略的强盗罪行
    旅大农民展开抗美援朝运动
    加紧生产，踊跃归还国家农贷，增强国防力量。
    【本报讯】据旅大人民日报消息：反对美国强盗扩大侵略战争的怒火，已燃烧在旅大农村。各地农民，对美帝的血腥侵略，无不发指，纷纷集会座谈，并以自己刚学会的字写了抗议书。他们决心以积极完成秋耕、踊跃归还农贷、储蓄等实际行动，抗击美帝扩大侵略战争。
    数日来，来自农村的抗议书、慰问信、决心书及反美侵略生产学习计划等函件计有五百三十四件之多。来函中都充满了对美帝的仇恨。一位农村教师高永善在给安东被美机扫射死伤的同胞的一封慰问信中写道：“美帝国主义的枪弹损伤你们的健康和生命，我们不能忘记这笔血债，将永远记在我们心里，作好充分准备，替你们报仇！”金县第八区华家村中共党员贾继武特作出个人冬季生产、工作、学习计划，报告区委，并转交报社，他说：“我要以积极生产和领导好生产的行动，保卫祖国。”旅大三等劳动英雄尹国选在函件中也写道：“美国鬼子，真是打灯笼捡粪，自找屎（死）！”通过座谈更使农民认识到美国强盗的血腥面貌。大连市郊大辛寨子镇农民，在民校座谈美帝侵略兽行时，农民于安庆咬牙切齿地说：“这条没长心肺的疯狗——美帝，扩大侵略战争，我要用我的镢头，把它的狗脑袋砸开，叫它死在我们手下，让它尝尝中国人民的厉害！”农民关恒心也说：“共产党领导咱刚刚直起腰来，分了房子，分了地，生活也一天比一天强起来，谁要破坏这个生活，那就是自挖坟墓自找死。”金县第八区全区妇女干部、金州市郊八里村农民、金县第十区岔山村连供信互助组员、金县第六区中心小学全校师生等，都开了座谈会，除痛斥美帝的侵略兽行，并都表示在各个不同的岗位上，百倍紧张起来，努力生产、学习、工作，并要进一步的提高警惕性，粉碎美蒋匪特的阴谋活动。
    把愤恨化为力量，各地农民日来生产情绪更为高涨。大连市郊后革镇堡村全村六千九百零三亩地，秋收后仅穿出二百十亩地，此次为了以实际行动反对美帝侵略，该村已有五十多名农民组织起来刨楂子，保证完成全村秋耕地。大连市郊郭家沟村果园户王家昌，在果园莳弄上更加了劲，往年对果树秋季管理上很忽视，今年已买妥五十片豆饼，准备“喂”树，并刨出四亩多果园子。除此并买了一大缸硫黄水，及拉锄、肥料等，准备好了足够来年生产用的一切物资。他说：“只有把生产搞好，国家才会更强，新中国的建设才会更好，最后一定能消灭侵犯我们的战争罪犯。”金县第十区山后村为了增强国防力量，农民踊跃还农贷。该村九十三户共欠政府八千四百三十斤贷粮，在此次反美侵略学习中，启发了农民，认识到加强国防建设，是击败美帝侵略的有力保证，仅在二十日一头晌的工夫就全部缴上。五十多岁的陈玉兰老大娘说：“我把农贷早早缴上，也是反对美国强盗的一份力量。”
