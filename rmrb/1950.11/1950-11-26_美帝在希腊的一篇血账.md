　　U.S. Imperialism's Bloody Debt in Greece
　　By Miboer·Akesiaoti, Translated by Chen Zhanyuan
　　Editor's Note: If there is still anyone who has not recognized the hideous face of U.S. imperialism, please read this article. The original was published in the joint July-August issue of the French magazine "Europe," in the "Balzac Special Issue." The author is a famous Greek female writer. The original title was "Why Can't We Talk About Balzac?" It reports the suffering and heroic resistance of the Greek people, deprived of freedom, under the bloody rule of U.S. imperialism and Greek reactionaries for the past three years. This is a heart-wrenching accusation by the Greek people against U.S. imperialism.

　　When we are burned by flames
　　All our pain is extinguished
　　And with this death
　　We conquer death.
　　嘉·扬努波路示（Ｋ．Yannopoulos）
　　—May 8, 1948, Yannopoulos, executed in the Egine prison.

　　These lines are excerpted from a poem he wrote in prison.

　　"Europe" magazine today asks us to write an article commemorating Balzac.

　　In Greece in 1950, there is truly no intellectual who can do this.

　　Our intellectuals are being murdered, tortured, exiled, and imprisoned. They are our best intellectuals. Those who remain in Athens or in the provinces are forced into silence, tightly bound, their mouths gagged. If some intellectuals can still raise their voices to argue, it is because they live abroad, escaping the clutches of the reactionaries, but these intellectuals only have one right left: to speak to those who are far away. If they do anything else, they will feel deeply ashamed.

　　And Balzac, the great realist, perhaps the earliest creator of literary realism, would certainly understand us, because the meaning of Balzac's art is precisely to speak of what is real. Giving the seat of honor to those whose hands are not holding a pen, but wearing handcuffs, is the way to touch the core of the real world of Greece.

　　Today, our closest neighbors are not the people at the small tavern across the street, nor those who have seen through everything, but our comrades imprisoned in Makronissos—we do not want this, but we accept this fact, taking it as a great honor. "Our reality" is our comrades imprisoned in Makronissos.

　　We are willing to present this meaning as Greece's position in the discussion about Balzac.

　　October 12, 1944, this was our day of liberation. At that time, there was not a single soldier of our Anglo-Saxon allies on our land. They landed three days later. Thanks to the immense pressure of the Soviet army advancing directly into the Balkans, the fighting of ELAS (Greek People's Liberation Army), and the movements of the masses in our cities, we worked together to eliminate the Nazis. In those four years, the number of our dead reached 50,000. If we were to make a comparison according to population ratio, it would be equivalent to three million dead in France.

　　This terrible bloodshed and the proportional destruction in all aspects of the country, needless to say, left us scarred after the war, but it also enriched us and nourished us with a new sap. The Greek people knew how to transform the sorrowful years of the occupation into the most fruitful moment of their long history. They knew how to transform it into a shining peak in their struggle for survival. Some dreams, which had always been dreams for many centuries, finally became tangible reality.

　　Here I will not talk about the decrees passed by the provisional government we established in the liberated areas for more than a year (laws on people's judicial autonomy, laws on women's rights, laws on distributing land to peasants, laws on completely free progressive education). These decrees were all implemented and reformed all sectors of private and national life. Here I only want to mention the intellectual circles and the new generation that grew up from the ruins.

　　The first thing I remember is our hunger. Yes, we were hungry for everything: to learn, to give, to create, to absorb, to change, to walk, to give birth, to rise, to think, to sing, and to live.

　　I remember the glorious suburb of Athens, Kaisariani. This place alone officially fought 49 battles with the occupying forces. I remember visiting there the day after liberation. On this day, people buried the last of the local dead, a young ELAS lieutenant. Elsewhere, people were engraving the names of the dead on marble. There was a wall where the Germans had shot more than two thousand people, a bloody stench emanating from the pit in front of it. And on the same day—this is absolutely true—I found the residents of Kaisariani in the office of E.A.M. (National Liberation Front), hunched over a desk, drafting plans to build a library and a local theater. "Our underground work was done very well," they told me, "we must be at the forefront in the reconstruction work during peacetime." This was the image of the Greek people on the day of liberation.

　　Because we had established people's theaters, libraries in various districts, suburbs, and factories in the city of Athens, as well as the "New Books" publishing company, which could be compared to the best publishers in Europe, during the period of occupation, the Greek people learned to read: the content changed, the writing changed, and they had already found things that interested them in our newspapers and new literature. The ancient writing—contrived, dead language—that the government forced us to learn was abandoned, colloquial writing solved one of the most serious problems in Greece, and even colloquial writing was used in official documents. "Let's learn to write colloquial writing quickly!" A reactionary intellectual said at a gathering near the end of the Nazi occupation, "Tomorrow, the Communist newspapers published under legal conditions will make us ashamed." This actually happened later.

　　Before the war, we maintained a sad record of illiteracy among European countries. Best-selling books sold no more than one thousand copies per year. I feel proud to think that my "Answers to Five Questions"—the first book we published after liberation—sold 6,000 copies in thirteen days and 11,000 copies in one month.

　　I remember some gatherings where our EPON (youth organization) comrades, eager to learn literary techniques from older people, and sailors and workers sending us some works in these gatherings, which were often minor masterpieces. I remember a literary award given by E.A.M. in 1946 to the best anti-enemy work, and the winner was a young worker, Sotllis Patatzis, who was writing for the first time. I think of those who could have become valuable writers if people had just let them live… In Greece, this was an era of "sudden thunder and lightning."

　　I remember Zachariades, the General Secretary of the Greek Communist Party, who was released from the Dachau concentration camp in 1945 after being imprisoned for ten years. After a brief introduction, we felt somewhat embarrassed standing around him. At this time, one of us asked him if we could ask him a question. Zachariades smiled with his very frank smile and said to us, "Comrades, you can ask anything, but don't trouble me with questions about surrealism or anything else I don't know, because I haven't studied these issues yet. All I know is that you should write articles first. You have so much to write about! Ten years ago, when I left you, there were only a few of you, now there are many more of you." It was really this great breath that swept across this country that brought most of the intellectuals into the progressive camp. Even the most hesitant intellectuals felt very ashamed of falling behind.

　　I ask you to believe that Zachariades did not let us be idle afterwards. I apologize, but you see, he also took care of all the problems related to those who used pens. We always had to do more. We never wrote enough. We never wrote well enough. Here, a magazine was missing; we set out to publish one. There, criticism had not taken on its task; the most capable critics worked hard to improve it. We sent him the list of our published books and the list of our unpublished manuscripts. "Comrades," he said to us, "compared to the great culture of our people, you are behind. Our workers are doing more than you are. Try to represent them well."

　　This was a great era, in which, for the first time, people in remote areas, afflicted suburbs, and miserable provinces of Greece flocked to all fields of life. And the Greek intellectuals, like Antaeus, who nourished himself with the sap of the earth, were encouraged by these people.

　　Is this era really so far away? Has there been a flood since then?

　　Friends, only three years have passed. Friends, three years have separated us from all the residents of the earth. The enemies separated mothers from their sons, snatched husbands from their wives' arms, made youth disappear from faces, left the dead without coffins, and even stopped the breath of life in the throat. Friends, U.S. imperialism has invaded Greece.

　　The enemies shot us in our theaters, they looted our libraries, they closed our publications, they burned our books, they re-changed our writing, they extinguished the lights, and people were forced to grope forward in the dark, like those young blind people. Groping forward to find their parents, to find their friends. But friends, they were no longer there.

　　"The sea has taken away my son."--This is a poetic sentence from this seafaring nation. But today, it is no longer the sea; in the clever words of contemporary imperialism, this is called: "U.S. Aid"—"Truman Doctrine"—"Marshall Plan"—"Atlantic Pact."

　　This "doctrine" has spent more than one billion dollars in three years to engage in civil war in Greece. The following are the results of the Greek civil war in three years:

　　—140,000 soldiers of the Greek government army were killed or wounded.

　　—400,000 children became orphans.

　　—The livelihoods of 700,000 people remained in the army.

　　—One million refugees with sallow faces, ragged clothes, and homeless.

　　—7,000 villages were burned down.

　　—25,000 houses were destroyed.

　　—105,000 houses were partially destroyed.

　　—More than 3,000 patriots were executed.

　　—More than 1,500 patriots were executed for participating in the anti-Nazi occupation movement.

　　—More than 10,000 patriots were tortured in prisons and concentration camps.

　　—70,000 patriots are currently imprisoned or exiled.

　　—20,000 patriots are currently imprisoned in the Makronissos concentration camp.

　　What about our intellectuals, what has become of them on this land of hell?

　　"On this island of tears and blood, on Makronissos—on remote cliffs, under tents, in newly discovered isolated corners, there are piles of blind people, madmen, injured people, paralyzed people lying on the ground. In the Seventh Brigade, a large group of scholars are suffering torture: seventy lawyers; eighteen agronomists; fifteen doctors; forty-eight professors; one hundred primary school teachers; four hundred other scientific workers and intellectuals. Some are over sixty years old.

　　"In just fifteen days—from October 10 to 25, 1949—the statistics for the 2,700 people imprisoned in that famous "Barb Wire" concentration camp were as follows: six deaths; sixty-seven insane; fifty seriously injured; four hundred lightly injured.

　　"In the 'Black Saint George' concentration camp, there are one hundred and fifty intellectuals, most of whom suffer from lung disease, others have broken thighs, arms or waists, and others have tumors growing on their heads after being tortured." (Investigation published by the socialist newspaper "Mahi" in March 1950.)

　　According to the plan of international imperialism, which established this new Dachau concentration camp in Greece, a particularly corrupting task was left for the intellectuals. If these well-known scientists and artists, suffering whips and unbelievable insults, signed the famous "letter of repentance," abandoning their philosophical and political views, then it would add good material to the official propaganda set up for foreign journalists from various countries' newspapers.

　　Well! The hopes of these criminals are completely dashed.

　　In this ancient country with such a strong light, on this granite land where the source of life has not dried up after five thousand years, on the lonely rocks of Makronissos, live our intellectuals, they are like unyielding modern Prometheuses:

　　—Jean Ritsos, poet, lung disease patient, living in a tent with seventy other people spitting blood, the same in summer and winter.

　　—Menelas Loydemis, novelist. Originally born with a disability, beaten and tortured from December 1 to 7, 1949. His wife and his six-year-old daughter were exiled with him.

　　—Tassos Liaditis, poet. Tortured from December 1 to 7, 1949.

　　—Loucas Kastanakis, writer, journalist, already fifty-five years old.

　　—Themos Kornaros, historian and writer. Once imprisoned by the Germans in that terrible Haidari concentration camp, the author of a book describing this concentration camp that has become a classic.

　　—Karoussos, actor of the National Theater, played major roles in the theater for many years. Suffered severe neurasthenia after being abused in Makronissos.

　　—Manos Katrakis, actor of the National Theater. Suffering from stomach tumors and hernias. Beaten in a depression on the night of December 6 to 7, 1949.

　　—Georgeli Yolassis, comedian. Tortured from December 1 to 7, 1949.

　　—Constantin Baladinias, actor. Has an ulcer in his intestine, lacking any treatment.

　　—Phivos Anoyannakies, composer and music critic. Suffering from tuberculous appendicitis.

　　—Imvriotis, professor at the University of Thessaloniki, who was dismissed before liberation for participating in the anti-Nazi resistance movement. His wife was also exiled to Makronissos.

　　—Des Potopoulos, professor at the University of Athens. They tortured him and broke his arm. Unable to get any confession from him with violence, the executioners of the Bairaktaris concentration camp became anxious and threatened him with the harshest torture and death. Des Potopoulos' simple answer stunned him: "I am a philosopher. Don't you know that all philosophy is a long preparation for death?"

　　—Demetre Fotiadis, writer, translator of Plato and Demosthenes' works, playwright, founder and president of the literary magazine "Lettres Libres." Weakened after being tortured, he lives with two hundred and fifty patients. They wanted to force him to write a "letter of repentance." They said to him: "Just sign this: 'I am Greek', and that's all we want you to do." Fotiadis replied proudly: "My entire work testifies to my loyalty to Greece. Why do I need to express it? When you came to arrest me, I was writing a play about the Exodus from Missolonghi. Do you know of anything more Greek than 'The Story of the Exodus from Missolonghi'?"

　　—Among the 675 women recently transferred to Makronissos from other concentration camps in Greece are young actress Aleaa Paszi; philologist Lisa Cottou; Kitty Kritsikis, whose husband—a doctor—barely escaped the death penalty a few months ago; and the famous educator Rosa Imvriotis, the wife of the professor imprisoned in Makronissos. Over fifty years old, she suffered two full years of torture in the Trikeri and Larissa prisons. (Secret documents received from Athens.)

　　I also have a close friend, a lawyer, who also stayed in Makronissos. I once sent him a few woodcut books as French souvenirs. After suffering only four months of torture in this concentration camp, he was declared insane and released, as they thought he was no longer of any use. In the few minutes of clarity when he could hold a pen, he immediately wrote me these simple words: "Thank you for your books. But when you sent these books, what I wanted was not books, but… water!"

　　Yes, I clearly remember our great thirst at the time of liberation, the thirst for knowledge, for creation, for thought. In 1950, in Greece, some people just want water! Because they can't drink water!

　　We thank "Europe" magazine for allowing us to state the Greek position in the discussion about Balzac.

　　We are waiting for the day when the Greek intellectuals, our glorious comrades, come out of the dungeons of death, tear off their handcuffs, and take up their pens again on the vast stage of life. They sacrificed everything for this dignity of life: their brains and their bodies.

　　美帝在希腊的一篇血账
    米波尔·阿克西奥提作  陈占元译
    编者按：美帝国主义的狰狞面目假使还有谁没有认清，请一读这篇文章。原文载于今年七、八两个月合刊的法国《欧罗巴》杂志的《巴尔扎克专号》，作者是希腊的著名女作家，原题为《我们为什么不能讲巴尔扎克？》这里报道了失去自由的希腊人民在美帝及希腊反动派三年来的血腥统治下的痛苦和壮烈反抗。这是希腊人民对美帝的一篇震颤人心的控诉书。
    当我们被火焰烧完了的时候
    所有我们的痛苦都熄灭了
    就用着这种死亡
    我们把死亡战胜了。
     嘉·扬努波路示（Ｋ．Ｙannopoulos）
    ——一九四八年五月八日，扬努波路示在爱琴（Ｅgine）牢狱中被处决。
    这几句诗是从他在狱中写的一首诗里摘录出来的。
    《欧罗巴》杂志今天要我们写一篇纪念巴尔扎克的文章。
    一九五零年的希腊当真没有一个知识分子能做这件事情。
    我们的知识分子遭受杀害，拷打，流放和监禁。他们是我们最优秀的知识分子。留在雅典或在外省的，他们都被迫沉默，紧紧地被缚着，嘴儿被堵着。如果有些知识分子还可以提高嗓子抗辩，那是因为他们住在外国，逃脱了反动分子的魔掌，但这些知识分子也只剩一种权利：对你们讲那些在远方的人。如果他们作别的事情的话，他们会感到十分惭愧。
    而巴尔扎克，这个伟大的现实主义者，或许是文学上的现实主义的最早的创造者，一定会十分理解我们的，因为巴尔扎克的艺术的意义，正是讲那实在的东西。把贵宾的座位让给那些手上不是执着一管笔，而是带着手镣的人们，这才接触到希腊的现实世界的核心。
    今天，我们最密切的邻人不是对门小酒店的人们，也不是那些看破了一切的人们，而是我们被囚在马克劳尼苏示（Ｍakronissos）的同志们——我们并不愿意这样，可是我们接受这个事实，把它作为很大的光荣。“我们的现实”就是被囚在马克劳尼苏示的同志们。
    我们愿意把这一点意思作为关于巴尔扎克的讨论中希腊的立场。
    一九四四年十月十二日，这是我们解放的日子，那时候，我们的土地上还没有我们的盎格鲁·撒克逊盟友的任何一个兵士。他们在三天之后才登陆。靠了直捣巴尔干的苏联军队的巨大压力，爱拉斯（Ｅlas希腊人民解放军）的战斗，以及我们城市里的群众的运动，我们齐心协力把纳粹消灭了。那四年间我们死亡的人数达五万人。如果按照人口比例打个比方说，就相等于法国的三百万个死者。
    这种可怕的流血和国内各方面的同比例的破坏，不用说使我们在战后遍地疮痍，然而也丰富了我们，并用一种新的汁液喂养了我们。希腊人民晓得把占领期间忧愁的岁月，化为他们悠长的历史最丰饶的顷间，他们晓得把它化为他们为生存而斗争的一个光辉的顶点。一些梦想，在过去许多世纪之间它们向来都是梦想，终于成为可以捉摸的现实了。
    在这里我不来讲我们在解放区成立了一年以上的临时政府所通过的法令（关于人民司法自治的法律，关于妇女权利的法律，关于把土地分配给农民的法律，关于完全免费的进步教育的法律），这些法令都经过实行，并且革新了私人生活和国家生活的各个部门。我在这里只想提及知识界和那从废墟上长大的新的一代。
    我最先记起的，就是我们的饥渴。是的，对于一切我们都感到饥渴：求知，给与，创造，吸收，改变，走路，生育，升高，思想，唱歌和生活。
    我记起雅典的光荣的近郊凯撒里阿尼（Ｋaissariani），单单这个地方就和占领军正式打过四十九回仗。我记起在解放的次日到过那里。这一天，人们埋葬当地最后的死者，一个爱拉斯的青年中尉。在别的地方人们又把死者们的名字镌在大理石上。有一道德国人在那里枪毙过二千人以上的墙，一阵血腥从它前面的穴中发散出来。而在同一天——这是千真万确的——我发见凯撒里阿尼的居民在易·阿·爱姆（Ｅ．Ａ．Ｍ．，人民解放阵线）的办公室里伏在一张办公桌上，正在起草建筑一个图书馆和一个地方剧场的计划。“我们过去的地下工作做得很好，”他们对我说：“在和平时期的重建工作里我们也要站在前锋。”这就是在解放的日子希腊人民的形象。
    因为我们在沦陷期间就把人民剧场，雅典城内各个市区的，近郊的和工厂的图书馆，以及比得上欧洲最好的出版家的“新书”（Ｎouveaux Ｌivres）出版公司办起来了，希腊人民就学会了读书：内容改变了，文字改变了，他们已经在我们的报纸和新文学里面找到他们感到兴趣的东西。政府强迫我们学的古文——矫揉造作的死文字——被废弃了，白话文解决了希腊一个最严重的问题，而甚至在公文里面也使用白话文了。“我们赶快学写白话文吧！”在纳粹占领时期快要结束的时候，一个反动的知识分子在一个集会上说：“明天在合法的条件之下出版的共产党报纸会使我们惭愧的。”这件事情后来实在也发生过。
    在战前，我们在欧洲国家中间保持着使人伤心的文盲纪录。畅销书每年卖出不超过一千册。想起我的《五个问题的答复》——我们在解放后出版的第一本书——在十三天之内卖了六千册，在一个月之内卖了一万一千册，我便感到骄傲。
    我记起一些集会，我们的爱蓬（Ｅpon，青年的组织）的同志们，渴望在这些集会里面，从年纪较大的人学习文学上的技术，海员和工人在这些会里给我们送来一些作品，这些作品往往是一些小杰作。我记起易·阿·爱姆在一九四六年颁发过的一种给与最佳抗敌作品的文学奖金，得奖人是一个第一次写作的青年工人，苏提里斯·柏达西示（Ｓotllis Ｐatatzis）。我想到那些本来可以成为有价值的作家的人，只要人们让他们活了下去……在希腊这是一个“疾雷迅电”的时代。
    我记起查察里阿德斯（Ｚachariades），被关了十年之后，一九四五年被从达梭（Ｄachau）集中营放出来的希腊共产党总书记。经过简单的介绍之后，站在他的周围，我们感到有一些窘。这个时候我们中间有一个人问他可不可以向他提出一个问题。查察里阿德斯用他的非常坦白的微笑微笑了，并且对我们说：“同志们，你们可以随便发问，可是别拿有关超现实主义的问题，或是别的什么我不知道的问题来难我，因为我还没有把这些问题研究过。我所知道的，就是首先你们应该写文章。你们有多少要写的话呵！十年前，我离开你们的时候，你们才只有寥寥几个人，现在你们的人数可多了。”实在就是飘过这个国度的这一股伟大的呼息，把大部分的知识分子带到进步的阵营里面来的。即使那些最迟疑不决的知识分子也因为落在后面而感到十分惭愧。
    我请你们相信，以后查察里阿德斯却没有让我们闲过。我抱歉，可是你们瞧，他也管到有关拿笔的工作者的一切问题了。我们总得多做一点。写得总是不够多。写得总是不够好。这里，缺少了一个杂志；我们便着手去出版一个杂志。那里，批评没有担负起它的任务；那些能力最强的批评家便努力去改善。我们把我们出版的书目和我们未发表的稿件的目录送给他看。“同志们，”他对我们说，“和我们人民的伟大文化相比，你们是落后了。我们的工人比你们做的事情多些。努力好好地把他们表现出来吧。”
    这是一个伟大的时代，在这个时代里面，头一次在希腊偏僻的区域，遭了劫难的近郊，和悲惨的外省的人民，都涌向人生的各个领域。而希腊的知识分子，象拿大地的汁液喂养自己的安替霭斯一样，从这些人民得到鼓励。
    这个时代真的是那么远了吗？此后就有过一回洪水吗？
    朋友们啊，仅仅经过了三年罢了。朋友们，三年工夫把我们和地上所有的居民隔离了。敌人们让母亲和她的儿子隔开，让丈夫从妻子怀里夺去，让青春从脸上消失，让死者没有棺木，连人生的呼息也在喉咽间被停住了。朋友们，美帝国主义侵入希腊来了。
    敌人们在我们的剧场里把我们枪毙，他们劫掠我们的图书馆，他们封闭我们的刊物，他们烧毁我们的书，他们重新改换我们的文字，他们熄灭了灯光，而人们被迫在黑暗中摸索着前进，好象那些年轻的盲人。摸索着前进去找寻他们的父母，找寻他们的朋友。但是朋友们，他们再也不在那里了。
    “海抢走了我的儿子。”——这是这个航海的民族的一个带有诗意的句子。但是在今日，再也不是海了；在当代帝国主义的巧妙的文字里，这叫做：“美援”——“杜鲁门主义”——“马歇尔计划”——“大西洋公约”。
    这个“主义”，在三年之间，花去了十亿以上的美元来从事希腊的内战。下面就是三年内希腊内战的结果：
    ——希腊政府军死伤士兵十四万人。
    ——四十万个小孩子成为孤儿。
    ——七十万人生活的依靠者始终留在军队里面。
    ——一百万个面有菜色，鹑衣百结，无家可归的难民。
    ——七千个村子被烧光。
    ——二万五千座房屋被毁坏。
    ——十万零五千座房屋半被毁坏。
    ——三千个以上的爱国者被处决。
    ——一千五百个以上的爱国者以参加过反纳粹占领军的运动的罪名被处决。
    ——一万个以上的爱国者在牢狱和在集中营里被拷打。
    —七万个爱国者目前被关在牢狱里面或被流放。
    —二万个爱国者目前被囚在马克劳尼苏示集中营。
    我们的知识分子呢，他们在这个地狱的土地上变成怎样了呢？
    “在这个泪和血的岛上，在马克劳尼苏示——在僻远的悬崖，在帐幕下面，在新发现的孤立的新角落里，有一些成堆的，躺卧在地上的瞎子，疯子，受伤的人，瘫痪的人。在第七大队里面，一大群的学者受着苦刑：七十个律师；十八个农学家；十五个医生；四十八个教授；一百个小学教员；四百个其他的科学工作者和知识分子。有些人在六十岁以上。
    “仅仅十五天—一九四九年十月十日至二十五日一的统计，关在那个有名的“齿刺”（Ｂarbelee）集中营里的二千七百个人里面就有了如下的成绩：死六人；疯六十七人；重伤五十人；轻伤四百人。
    “在‘圣·乔治’（Ｂleck Ｓaintgeorge）集中营里，有一百五十个知识分子，大部分都害了肺病，其他的折断了大腿，手臂或腰部，还有的受了苦刑之后脑部长着瘤子。”（一九五零年三月社会党报纸“马希”（Ｍahi）发表的调查。）
    按照在希腊设立了这个新的达梭集中营的国际帝国主义的计划，特别给知识分子们留下一桩败坏人心的工作。如果这些知名的科学家和艺术家，受着鞭挞，遭受不能置信的侮辱，签了那个闻名的“悔过书”，放弃他们的哲学和政治的见解，那末就会给那种为各国报纸的外国记者们而设的官方宣传加添很好的材料。
    好！这些犯罪者的希望完全归于破灭。
    在这有一种这么强烈的光明的古国里，在这片五千年后生命的泉源还不枯竭的花岗石的土地上，在马克劳尼苏示孤零零的寂寞的岩石上，生活着我们的知识分子，他们象是一些不屈服的现代的普罗密修士：
    ——若望·里修斯（Ｊean Ｒitsos），诗人，肺病患者，和别的七十个咯血的人同住在一个帐幕里面，夏天和冬天一样。
    ——米尼拉斯·洛亚迪米斯（Ｍenelas Ｌoydemis），小说家。本来生下来就有残疾，在一九四九年十二月一日至七日，被殴打和受苦刑。他的妻和他的六岁的女儿，和他一起被流放。
    ——塔修士·里瓦迪提斯（Ｔassos Ｌiaditis），诗人。在一九四九年十二月一日至七日，受苦刑。
    ——劳贾士·嘉示达那基示（Ｌoucas Ｋastanakis），作家，记者，已经有五十五岁。
    ——提默士·哥拿洛示（Ｔhemos Ｋornaros），史学家和作家。曾被德国人关在那可怕的阿意达里（Ｈaidari）集中营，一本已经成为经典的描写这个集中营的书的作者。
    ——嘉劳苏示（Ｋaroussos），国家剧院的演员，在该院扮演主要角色多年。在马克劳尼苏示受了种种虐待之后，患很重的神经衰弱。
    ——马奴斯·嘉特拉基示（Ｍanos Ｋatrakis），国家剧院演员。患胃瘤和脱肠症。一九四九年十二月六日到七日的夜里在一个洼地里被殴打。
    ——乔治·尧拉西斯（Ｇeorgeli Ｙolassis），喜剧演员。一九四九年十二月一日至七日被拷打。
    ——康斯旦丁·巴拉的尼亚示（Ｃonstantin Ｂaladinias），演员。肠里长一个疮，缺乏任何治疗。
    ——非伏示·阿努依亚那基示（Ｐhivos Ａnoyannakies），作曲家和音乐批评家。患结核盲肠炎。
    ——殷伏里奥提示（Ｉmvriotis）因参加反纳粹的抵抗运动在解放前被解聘的莎罗尼加大学教授。他的妻也被流放到马克劳尼苏示。
    ——第士波吐朴路斯（Ｄes Ｐotopoulos），雅典大学教授。他们拷打过他，把他的手臂打断了。用尽暴力得不到他的任何口供，拜意拉克达里示（Ｂairaktaris）集中营的行刑者发急了，就用最严酷的苦刑和用死威胁他。第士波吐朴路斯这句简单的答语使他目瞪口呆：“我是哲学家。你不知道一切哲学都是一种对于死的长期准备么？”
    ——狄米特·福迪阿的示（Ｄemetre Ｆotiadis），作家，柏拉图和狄谋斯迪纳（Ｄemosthene）的作品的翻译者，戏剧作家，《自由文学》（ＬettresＬibres）文艺杂志社的创办人和社长。受苦刑之后身体衰弱了，他和二百五十个病人在一起生活。他们想逼他写一篇“悔过书”。他们对他说：“你只签上这个：‘我是希腊人’，就行了。我们要你做的只是这件事情。”福迪阿的示自负地答道：“我的全部作品为我的对于希腊的忠诚作证。为什么还要表白呢？当你们来逮捕我的时候，我正在写一篇讲从米苏龙基（Ｍissololonghi）的出走的戏剧。你们知道还有比‘从米苏龙基出走的故事’更富有希腊风格的吗？”
    ——在最近从希腊别的集中营移到马克劳尼苏示的六百七十五个妇人中间，有青年女演员阿里嘉·贝齐（Ａleaa Ｐaszi）；考据学家里莎·哥托（Ｌisa Ｃottou）；吉提·克利昔启示（Ｋitty Ｋritsikis），她的丈夫——一个医生——在几月前仅免于极刑；还有那个有名的教育家露莎·殷伏里奥提示，（Ｒosa Ｉmvriotis）即那位被关在马克劳尼苏示的教授的妻。年纪在五十岁以上，她在特里克利（Ｔrikeri）和拉里萨（Ｌarissa）牢狱受了整整两年的苦刑。（从雅典收到的秘密文件。）
    我个人也有一个挚友，一个律师，他也在马克劳尼苏示待过。我曾经给他寄去几本木刻书籍，作为法国的纪念品。在这个集中营里受了仅仅四个月的苦刑，他便被宣称为疯子，因而获释，他们认为他此后没有什么用处了。在几分钟的神志清明能够执笔的时候，他就马上给我写了这几句简单的话：“谢谢你的书籍。但是在你寄出这些书籍的时候，我想得到的不是书籍，而是……水！”
    是的，我清楚记得在解放时我们的极大的饥渴，对于求知，对于创造，对于思想的饥渴。在一九五零年，在希腊，有些人却只想得到水！因为他们喝不到水！
    我们感谢《欧罗巴》杂志让我们在关于巴尔扎克的讨论中陈述希腊人的立场。
    我们等待着有一天，希腊的知识分子，我们光荣的同志从死亡的地窖走出来，从手上扯掉他们的手镣，在广大的人生舞台上重新执起笔管。他们为这人生的尊严牺牲了一切：他们的脑子和他们的身体。
