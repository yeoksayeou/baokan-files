Movie Promotion Month Good Movie Introduction
《Zhao Yiman》

Just by watching the film "Zhao Yiman," one can understand what the Chinese people's attitude towards imperialism is. Zhao Yiman is a national heroine in the Anti-Japanese United Army. Under extremely difficult circumstances, she stood at the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle, leading the people and exerting great combat power, severely打击 (dǎjī - strike/crack down on) the enemy and disrupting their peace. This shows that the strength of the Chinese people is unparalleled and ubiquitous. Wherever there are people, there is strength to resist imperialism.

The Chinese people have always possessed the qualities of diligence, perseverance, unyielding spirit, and selfless sacrifice. Zhao Yiman is a prime example. For the sake of the country and the people, she would never bow her head and submit to the enemy, whether it was severe torture, solicitous seduction, cold and hunger, or hardship and difficulty... all of these could not scare the Chinese people. On the contrary, they only grit their teeth, endure hardships, and fight against the enemy, displaying a revolutionary heroism of "宁死不屈 (nìng sǐ bù qū - rather die than submit)."

Zhao Yiman's immortal glory illuminates the path forward for us, the Chinese people. We will carry forward our glorious tradition of resisting imperialism in the great struggle of "Resisting America, Aiding Korea, and Defending Our Homes and Country," defeat American imperialism, and achieve lasting world peace.

    《赵一曼》
    只要看《赵一曼》这部影片就可以明白中国人民对帝国主义所表现的是什么。赵一曼是一个抗日联军中的民族女英雄，她在非常艰苦的情况下站在反帝国主义的最前列，领导着人民，发挥很大的战斗力量，严重的打击敌人，扰乱敌人的安宁，这就说明中国人民的力量是无可比拟的，是到处蕴藏着的，那里有人民那里就有反抗帝国主义的力量。
    中国人民一直都有着刻苦耐劳坚贞不屈的气质及忘我牺牲的精神，赵一曼就是一个最好的榜样。为国家，为人民，决不在敌人面前低头屈服，是严刑拷打也罢，是殷勤诱惑也罢，是寒冷饥饿也罢，是艰险困难也罢………，所有这些都吓不倒中国人民；相反地，只有咬紧牙关苦熬下去和敌人作斗争，所表现的是丝毫没有恐惧，“宁死不屈”的革命英雄主义。
    赵一曼不朽的光辉照亮了我们中国人民前进的道路，我们将在“抗美援朝、保家卫国”的伟大斗争中发扬我们反抗帝国主义的光荣传统，打败美帝国主义，获得世界永久和平。  （子青）
