　　Agricultural Labor Hero Li Shaode of Lüda:
    The Whole Family Holds a Meeting to Oppose American Imperialist Aggression
    Everyone Rallies to Defend Our Good Life
    [Report from this newspaper] According to a report from the Lüda People's Daily: On the evening of October 19th, agricultural labor hero Li Shaode's family held a routine family meeting to discuss and study the current situation. The entire family unanimously opposed the expansion of the war of aggression by American imperialism. Everyone first recalled the suffering during the period of Japanese imperialist rule, when the father and his sons had to work for the imperialist running-dog landlord. They labored like animals, without earning a single plot of land or a room. Japanese devils and landlords would beat and scold them at will, or seize them to do hard labor. Li Shaode was seized to do hard labor, and couldn't bear the beatings and scoldings of the Japanese devils. He ate acorn-flour cornbread and still wasn't full. Plus, he had to carry mud and stones for thirteen or fourteen hours a day, and he fell ill from exhaustion and almost died. The family members all fell ill at home from fright, exhaustion, and hunger. It was truly a living hell! After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people took power and carried out rent reduction, interest reduction, and land reform, thus transforming from a hellish life to a free and happy life. No one dared to ride on our heads again. Talking about today, they discussed: The Japanese imperialists were only defeated a few years ago, and now the American bandits want to invade China again, trying to destroy our good life. This cannot be tolerated. Therefore, the meeting turned to discuss what we should do in this situation? Hero Li Shaode said: "We don't want to live like animals again, so what should we do? We can only take practical action to improve agricultural production and fight back. We must unite together, increase production, and fight against American imperialism. Currently, we will lead everyone to finish planting all the hawthorns in the village and carry out autumn tillage. At the same time, we must teach four women how to plow!" Li Shaode's sixty-two-year-old mother said through gritted teeth: "Evil-hearted people will not get good! Don't think I'm old, I can still be a fighter against American imperialism. I will feed the pig (one hundred and fifty catties) five times instead of four, and sell it for money in the twelfth lunar month to buy a cow. Everyone says you can't hatch chickens in the fall, but I will study how to hatch a brood of chicks and a brood of ducklings, and I will teach the method to others!" Li Shaode's father, Li Tianfu, said: "Our mutual aid team has nineteen *mu* (one *mu* equals six *shi mu*) of land, and we will till it all this autumn to produce more grain. 'Before the troops move, food and fodder must go first.' We must prepare food and fodder to support our People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan, a good life must be earned ourselves." Li Shaode's wife, Sui Guihua, and his sister-in-law, Sun Lanying, also made plans to oppose American imperialist aggression. They will go to the Beihai salt flats to sort麻袋 and engage in sideline production starting the next day. One person can earn thirty thousand *yuan* a day, and they plan to work for fifty days, earning money to buy clothes for themselves and their children, saving the expenses from the "community pot" in order to concentrate resources on production to fight back against American imperialist aggression. Ten-year-old Li Chongxian told his mother and grandmother that he would study hard, not skip class, and after school, besides reviewing his lessons, he would help collect manure and pick up grass. Li Shaode said: "That's right, in this way, our whole family of nine (except for the two infants), eight strands of rope will be tightened together to defend our good life."

　　旅大农业劳动英雄李绍德
    全家开会反对美帝侵略
    一齐紧张起来，保卫美好生活
    【本报讯】据旅大人民日报消息：十月十九日晚间，农业劳动英雄李绍德的家里，开家庭例会，讨论与学习目前形势。全家大小一致反对美帝扩大侵略战争。大家首先回忆了日本帝国主义统治时期，父子三人曾给帝国主义的狗腿地主扛活的苦情。那时像牛马样的劳动，没有挣下一垅土地和一间房子。日本鬼子、地主随便打骂，或抓去做苦工。李绍德就因为被抓去做苦工，受不了日本鬼子的打骂，吃橡子面的窝窝头还不管饱，加上一天十三、四个小时的抬泥抬石头，累病了差一点死去。家里的人都因吓、累、饿病倒在家里。那真是地狱生活！解放后在共产党领导下人民掌了大权，进行了减租减息与土地改革，因而由地狱生活一跃转变到自由幸福的生活，再也没有谁敢骑在头上。谈到今天时，他们议论道：日本帝国主义才被打垮几年，美国强盗又要来侵略中国，想来破坏我们的美好生活，这是不能容忍的。因此会议便转到讨论在这样情况下我们怎样办？英雄李绍德说：“我们不愿意再过牛马生活，那么怎么办呢？只有拿实际行动，搞好农业生产回击它，我们大家要团结在一起，提高生产，向美帝做斗争；目前领导大家把全村楂子穿完和进行秋塌地，同时还要教会四个妇女扶犁！”六十二岁的李绍德的母亲咬牙切齿地说：“坏心的人不能得好！别看我老，对付美帝也当一个，我把猪（一百五十斤）从五遍喂到六遍，喂到腊月卖了钱买一头牛。都说秋天不能抱鸡，我要研究抱他一窝小鸡和一窝小鸭，还要把办法教给别人！”李绍德的父亲李天福说：“俺互助组十九天（一天等于六市亩）地，今秋都给塌出来，叫它更多打粮。‘人马不到，粮草先行。’准备好粮草，支援咱们解放军解放台湾，好日子得自己争取。”李绍德的老婆隋桂花，嫂子孙兰英也都作出反对美帝侵略的计划。她们要从第二天起到北海盐滩整理麻袋进行副业生产。一天一个人可赚三万元，计划干五十天，赚来钱给自己和孩子买衣服，省出“伙里”的开支，以便集中投向生产，回击美帝侵略。十岁的李崇先告诉他妈妈、奶奶，要好好学习，不旷课，下学后除了复习功课，就帮助捡粪、拾草。李绍德说：“对，这样咱全家九口（除了两个婴儿），八股绳一齐紧起来，保卫咱们的好生活。”
