Soviet Union
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 14th: Moscow newspapers have been publishing news about the Chinese people's movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend their country for several days. On the 11th, all newspapers published the communique issued by the General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army stating that the Korean People's Army, with the participation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, was fighting against the American aggressors. The newspapers also published editorials from Shanghai's Liberation Daily, Ta Kung Pao, News Daily, and Wenhui Daily regarding the Chinese people's determination to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend their country. On the 13th, the Pravda published the full text of the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement on the 11th, as well as a dispatch from Pravda's Beijing correspondent, Visokov. Visokov wrote in his dispatch entitled "Chinese People Volunteer to Go to Korea": "The criminal flames of war ignited in Korea by the American arsonists have burned close to the Chinese border. It seriously threatens the security of the People's Republic of China. A wave of patriotic enthusiasm has swept across the entire China and has developed into a movement of large numbers of Chinese volunteer soldiers participating in the army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea."

Bulgaria
Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 14th: According to a report from the Telegraph Agency Sofia on the 11th: The Bulgarian people warmly welcome the joint declaration issued by the Chinese democratic parties on the 4th. The declaration has brought them hope and enthusiasm, and all factories and institutions have been actively discussing it. Workers at the Sofia Brick Factory in Sofia passed a resolution stating: We Bulgarian workers express our deep gratitude to the lofty aspirations of the great Chinese people and to China's neighbor, the heroic Korean people, who are fighting against the American and British aggressors. The Sofia Municipal Workers passed a resolution stating: We are confident that the Chinese people will do more to promote and consolidate lasting world peace.

Poland
Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 16th: The Polish "Warsaw Life Daily" published a commentary on the 8th entitled "When the Neighbor's House is on Fire," stating: "The declaration of the Chinese democratic parties proposes that rescuing the neighbor is rescuing oneself, which contains a very profound meaning. For the past hundred years, the aggression of American imperialism has undoubtedly been directed at China. The Chinese authorities have repeatedly warned American imperialism that the Chinese people cannot stand idly by while his neighbor Korea is being invaded." The newspaper concluded: "To restore peace in the Far East, it can only be realized after the imperialists and colonialists are crushed."

Sweden
The Swedish Communist Party's newspaper "Ny Tid" (New Era) published an editorial on the 15th stating that the Chinese people have the right to defend themselves against the attempt by the American imperialists to conquer the new China through war. "One aspect of this self-defense action is the Chinese People's Volunteer Army defending the motherland by aiding Korea. The newspaper said: Amidst the unbridled threats against China by American monopoly capital newspapers, it is said that "Truman's vassal states are hesitant, given the possibility of being dragged into a war against China." The newspaper stated: This is understandable. Because America's forceful occupation of Taiwan and its attempt to conquer China cannot be concealed. In this case, "How can the Chinese right to defend itself and resist American aggression be denied?"

    苏保等国舆论支持我抗美援朝
    热烈欢迎中国各民主党派联合宣言
    苏联
    【新华社莫斯科十四日电】莫斯科报纸连日刊载中国人民抗美援朝保家卫国运动的消息。十一日各报都刊登了朝鲜人民军总司令部发表的朝鲜人民军在中国人民志愿部队参加下对美国侵略者作战的公报。各报并刊载了上海解放日报、大公报、新闻日报、文汇报关于中国人民抗美援朝，保家卫国的决心的社论。十三日真理报刊载了中国外交部发言人十一日声明的全文，以及真理报驻北京记者维索科夫的通讯。维索科夫在题为“中国人民志愿赴朝”的通讯中写道：“美国纵火者在朝鲜燃起的罪恶的战火，已烧近中国的边境。它严重地威胁了中华人民共和国的安全。爱国热情的浪潮已席卷了整个中国，并已发展为中国志愿战士大批参加朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的军队的运动。”
    保加利亚
    【新华社布拉格十四日电】据电通社索非亚十一日讯：保加利亚人民热烈欢迎四日中国各民主党派所发表的联合宣言。宣言给他们带来了希望与热情，所有的工厂与机关已纷纷进行讨论。保京索非亚制砖工厂的工人通过决议称：我们保加利亚工人对于伟大的中国人民的崇高的志愿，以及中国的邻人——正与美英侵略者作战的英雄的朝鲜人民，表示深切的感谢。索非亚市政职工通过的决议称：我们确信中国人民将有更多的作为，以促成并巩固全世界的持久和平。
    波兰
    【新华社布拉格十六日电】波兰“华沙生活报”八日以“当邻居起火”为题发表评论称：“中国各民主党派宣言中提出救邻就是自救，含有很深刻的意义。近百年来美帝国主义的侵略，无疑地指向中国。中国当局曾数次警告美帝国主义说，中国人民对侵略他的邻邦朝鲜不能置之不理。”该报结语称：“要想在远东恢复和平，只有在帝国主义者和殖民主义者被粉碎之后，才能实现。”
    瑞典
    瑞典共产党机关报《新时代报》于十五日发表社论称：中国人民有权保卫自己，反对美帝国主义者借战争征服新中国的企图。“这种自卫行动的环节之一，是中国人民志愿部队以援助朝鲜的方法保卫祖国。该报说：在美国独占资本报纸对中国进行肆无忌惮的威胁中，据说，“杜鲁门的附庸国家，鉴于自己有被拖入对中国的战争的可能，都是裹足不前的。”该报称：这是可以理解的。因为美国以暴力强占台湾，妄图征服中国，是无法掩饰的。在这种情况下，“中国保卫自己，抵抗美国侵略的权利，又怎样否认得了呢？”
