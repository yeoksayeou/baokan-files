Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai cabled the United Nations Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council on the 11th, declaring that China cannot accept the invitation decided upon by the Security Council at its meeting on November 8th, and demanding that the Security Council merge the case of China's accusation against the U.S. government's armed aggression against Taiwan with the issue of the U.S. government's armed intervention in Korea for discussion, so that China can present its accusations. The text of the telegram is as follows:

To Mr. Trygve Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations at Lake Success, New York, and please forward to Mr. Bebler, President of the Security Council:

Your Excellency Lie's telegram number 36 is acknowledged.

I, representing the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, declare to the United Nations Security Council: We cannot accept the invitation decided upon by the Security Council at its 520th meeting on November 8th, 1950, because this invitation, according to the content of the resolution, deprives the representative of the Central People's Government of China of the right to discuss in the Security Council the issue of greatest concern to the Chinese people, namely, the U.S. government's armed intervention in Korea and aggression against China, and limits the Chinese representative's rights to discussing the so-called special report of the United Nations Command; this so-called United Nations Command was illegally created under the manipulation of the United States without the participation of the two permanent member states of the Security Council, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and therefore its report is not only one-sided and with ulterior motives, but also illegal and cannot be used as a basis for discussion.

I now, representing the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, propose to the United Nations Security Council: In view of the seriousness and close connection between the two issues of the U.S. government's armed intervention in Korea and aggression against China's Taiwan, the Security Council should merge the motion of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China accusing the U.S. government of armed aggression against Taiwan with the issue of the U.S. government's armed intervention in Korea for discussion, so that when the representative of the People's Republic of China attends the Security Council to discuss the motion of "Accusation of Armed Aggression against Taiwan," they may simultaneously present accusations regarding the issue of the U.S. government's armed intervention in Korea, which would be most convenient.

Respectfully submitted for your consideration.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Zhou Enlai

　　周外长电复安理会
　　  声明我国不能接受八日会议决定的邀请要求将我控美侵台与朝鲜问题合并讨论
    【新华社十一日讯】我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长，十一日电复联合国秘书长和安全理事会主席，声明我国不能接受安理会十一月八日会议所决定的邀请，并要求安理会将我国控诉美国政府武装侵略台湾案与美国政府武装干涉朝鲜问题合并讨论，以便我国提出控诉。电文如下：纽约成功湖联合国秘书长赖伊先生并请转安全理事会主席贝勃勒先生：
    赖伊先生三十六号电谨悉。
    我代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府向联合国安全理事会声明：我们不能接受一九五○年十一月八日安全理事会第五二○次会议所决定的邀请，因为这项邀请，按照决议的内容，剥夺了中华人民共和国中央人民政府代表在安全理事会上讨论中国人民所最感迫切的问题，即美国政府武装干涉朝鲜和侵略中国的问题，而将中国代表的权利限制在讨论所谓联合国司令部的特别报告上面；这个所谓联合国司令部是在安全理事会没有苏联和中华人民共和国两个常任理事国参加并在美国操纵之下非法产生的，因之它的报告不仅是片面的和别有用心的，而且是非法的，绝不能作为讨论的根据。
    我现在代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府向联合国安全理事会提议：鉴于美国政府武装干涉朝鲜和侵略中国的台湾这两个问题的严重性而又被密切地联系着，安全理事会应将我中华人民共和国中央人民政府控诉美国政府武装侵略台湾议案与美国政府武装干涉朝鲜问题合并讨论，以便我中华人民共和国代表出席安全理事会讨论“控诉武装侵略台湾”议案时，得以同时提出控诉美国政府武装干涉朝鲜问题，实为至便。
    专此奉达，即希查照。
                  中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长  周恩来
                                  一九五○年十一月十一日于北京
