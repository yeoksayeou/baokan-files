Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 22nd: Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation to the Second World Peace Congress, delivered a speech at the afternoon session on the 18th. The speech is as follows:

	Mr. Chairman, Distinguished Delegates:

	The Second World Peace Congress has opened in Warsaw. On behalf of the Chinese people, I would like to pay tribute to the Polish people and to the great leader of the Polish people, Bolesław Bierut, and express my heartfelt gratitude to the Polish government.

	Our Chinese delegation, as well as delegations from other Eastern countries, traveled 10,000 kilometers to Europe. We originally intended to go to Sheffield to shake hands with the British people. But now we have been welcomed in Warsaw. We even heard in the East that some kind of "Iron Curtain" existed. But we did not see any Iron Curtain on our journey from Siberia to Eastern Europe, and only finally discovered it on the other side of the English Channel.

	The British government actually prevented the people of various countries from meeting with the British people. This government, fearing peace, tried to obstruct the peace movement. But from the perspective of the people of the East, this is not surprising. Today, in our East, the aggressive bloc headed by US imperialism has gone from obstructing the cause of peace to directly undermining peace, from clamoring for war to aggression. The adventurous aggression of US imperialism in Korea has encroached on the Sino-Korean border. While invading Korea, the United States also occupied our Taiwan, making our Taiwan Strait the frontline of US defense, and invaded our northeastern and Shandong airspace and the Shandong coast, carrying out wanton bombing and strafing. The United States openly interferes in and ruthlessly suppresses the national liberation struggles in Vietnam, the Philippines, and Southeast Asia.

	While planning aggression and interference in the internal affairs of other countries, US imperialism hypocritically claims that other countries are carrying out aggression. Thus, they insist that Koreans are invading Korea, and Chinese are invading Chinese Taiwan. Consequently, the warmongers have appointed themselves as "saviors," describing their acts of aggression as moral assistance and their attempt to dominate the world as compassionate relief. So, when you talk about defending peace and security, they also talk about "defending peace and security"; when you talk about striving for freedom and democracy, they also talk about "striving for freedom and democracy," and claim that theirs are genuine, while yours are fake. Haven’t Mr. Truman and Mr. Acheson of the United States recently said that they are good friends of us Easterners? – Ah, not just good friends, but practically great benefactors of us Easterners!

	For fifty years, we have suffered from the long-term aggression of Japanese imperialism. Due to the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's policy of flattery and betrayal, we finally invited the large-scale invasion since 1937. We spent eight years of arduous resistance to finally defeat Japanese imperialism. During the early stages of our arduous resistance, the first and only country to help us was the Soviet Union. What about the United States? It constantly dealt with Japanese imperialists, selling them large quantities of scrap iron, gasoline, cotton, and machinery, which they then used to slaughter us, causing us to sacrifice countless lives and property. This is the "great favor" that our American "good friend" gave us!

	After Japan surrendered, we Chinese people longed for peaceful construction, but the United States did its best to support our national traitors, using airplanes, cannons, tanks, warships, US dollars, US equipment, relief supplies, and surplus materials to support Chiang Kai-shek in seizing countless rights over our seas, lands, and air. It instigated Chiang Kai-shek to launch a civil war, forcing us Chinese people to endure another four years of sacrifice, and finally win today's victory in the People's Liberation War. We should thank our American "good friend." Most of the airplanes, cannons, tanks, warships, US equipment, and materials that the United States gave to Chiang Kai-shek were transferred to the hands of our People's Liberation Army. Chiang Kai-shek became the transportation captain for the People's Liberation Army, and the United States became our arsenal. This is the "great favor" that our American "good friend" gave us!

	And isn't it the American "good friend" who is still supporting Chiang Kai-shek today? Although the occupation on the mainland failed, they grabbed our Taiwan in their hands and moved the defense line to our Taiwan Strait, isn't it the American "good friend"? Japanese imperialists are our irreconcilable enemies, but under the protection and support of our American "good friend," they are gradually restoring their original appearance. This is the "great favor" that our American "good friend" gave us!

	Holding the United Nations hostage, treating the United Nations as its private property, to cover up the United States' various criminal acts. Sheltering Chiang Kai-shek's representative, who is not supported by any Chinese people, to represent the Chinese people in the United Nations, and stubbornly refusing to allow the true people's representatives of our People's Republic of China to participate. This is the "great favor" that our American "good friend" gave us! Naturally, our American "good friend" will solemnly say: We respect the democratic way of solving problems! All resolutions of the United Nations are based on the principle of minority obeying the majority. Yes, if we are talking about numbers, the manipulating organs of the voting machines can be seen through at a glance. The total population of the sixty countries participating in the United Nations is 1.85 billion. If we are to respect majority decisions, please calculate the votes based on the size of the population. Chiang Kai-shek has one vote in the United Nations, representing only himself and a small group of reactionaries, while our People's Republic of China, with 475 million people, has zero votes. This is the so-called democratic way of solving problems!

	The United Nations has been insulted by US imperialism, especially in the criminal act of invading Korea, using the flag of the United Nations as a fig leaf. This is a great shame for the 1.85 billion people. The US imperialist aggression against Korea did not begin in June of this year. After Japan surrendered in 1945, the United States replaced the Japanese imperialists in occupying southern Korea south of the 38th parallel. In less than five years, US capital accounted for 91.23 percent of the total capital in South Korea, monopolized foreign trade, formed a huge trade deficit, and pushed industry and agriculture to the brink of bankruptcy. For example, the production of the machinery industry in the first half of 1949 was only 5 percent of that in 1943 under Japanese rule. The area of cultivated land was reduced to 55 percent compared to before liberation. As a result, South Korea, famous for its rice production, became food-deficient. This is another "great favor" from our American "good friend" to the Korean people! Today, this "favor" has been further expanded. US aggressor troops have crossed the 38th parallel, occupied Pyongyang and Wonsan, and are approaching the Yalu River. American planes are bombing peaceful cities and villages in northern Korea every day, strafing peaceful residents, the old, weak, women and children, and have repeatedly crossed the Yalu River to bomb and strafe within our northeast and Shandong. This is the "great favor" that our American "good friend" gave to us Easterners!

	Of course, what we are saying here is only about the US imperialist aggressors, not about the American people. The American people, like the people of all countries, like the Chinese people, also love peace, but they are oppressed and threatened by US imperialists.

	Alright, no more to say. These "great favors" are countless and endless.

	For the sake of comparison, let us also talk about our impressions of the Soviet Union.

	How has the Soviet Union treated us Chinese people? We Chinese people certainly know better than Mr. Truman and Mr. Acheson. Since the success of the October Revolution, the Soviet Union has automatically abolished all unequal treaties with us from the Tsarist era, and has consistently expressed sympathy for our people's liberation cause.

	After the founding of our People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union established diplomatic relations with us the very next day. Then we signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, to jointly defend against imperialist aggression in the East, jointly safeguard world peace and security, and to assist each other as much as possible in economic and cultural matters based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. These are also facts, which cannot be changed in the slightest by the sweet words of some liars.

	Isn't this contrast clear enough? The Soviet Union is helping us Chinese people, while the United States is helping the butcher of the Chinese people - Chiang Kai-shek. The Soviet Union wants to work with us to prevent the revival of Japanese imperialism, while the United States is desperately supporting the revival of Japanese imperialism to invade us. The Soviet Union is assisting us in peaceful construction, while the United States is invading our Taiwan, invading our neighbors, threatening our national defense, disrupting peace in Asia, and preventing us from building in peace. The Soviet Union is doing its best to support us in joining the United Nations, while the United States is doing its best to prevent us from joining the United Nations. The Soviet Union has proposed a peace plan in the UN General Assembly, while the United States is manipulating the United Nations to engage in aggression. The Soviet Union is using atomic energy to transform nature, while the United States is using atomic bombs to intimidate all mankind. The Soviet Union is carrying out the construction of the massive Stalingrad and Kuibyshev hydropower stations and the excavation of the world's longest Turkmen Canal, while the United States is expanding military bases around the world, establishing a huge network of bases, and moving its defense line across the Atlantic to Western Europe, and across the Pacific to our territory. The Soviet Union is promoting Michurin's theory and perennial wheat in the frigid zone, while the United States is promoting hydrogen bombs and germ warfare. Isn't this contrast clear enough?

	The sweet words emitted by the vocal cords cannot cover up the bloody crimes caused by bombs. Today, we see very clearly that all the vocabulary of US imperialists should be interpreted from the opposite perspective. The "universal morality" in the mouths of US imperialists is rampant tyranny, the so-called "lofty ideals" are aggressive ambitions, and the so-called "peace and justice" are war and domination. Enslavement and slaughter are their "human dignity." Bombing peaceful cities and villages and strafing peaceful residents, women and children are their "spiritual values of life." Mr. Truman also shouted about "disarmament" in his speech at the General Assembly on September 24, the fifth anniversary of the United Nations, but the astronomical figures of the US military budget are increasing day by day. In addition, the production of atomic bombs is expanding, and the threat of hydrogen bombs is increasing. Truman also shouted about "guaranteeing human rights," but Qian Xuesen, a Chinese scholar, was detained in the United States and not allowed to return home; Zhao Zhongyao and his two students, scholars returning home, were kidnapped by MacArthur when they passed through Yokohama, Japan. So, the US imperialists' "disarmament" means expanding armaments, and the US imperialists' "guaranteeing human rights" means trampling on human rights.

	Hypocrites, you are futile! Today, we should also thank you for your reverse instructions. Whatever you oppose should be welcomed by us, and whatever you welcome should be opposed by us. We also recognize very clearly: the hypocrisy of evildoers is because the power of good has overwhelmed them, forcing them to pretend. The arrogance of imperialism does not indicate its strength, but only indicates its fragility.

	We Chinese people love peace. The fact that more than 22.3 million people in China have signed the Stockholm Appeal is excellent proof. But precisely because we love peace, we resolutely oppose aggression. Our nation has been fighting against the aggressors who threaten peace, disrupt peace, and destroy peace for more than a hundred years. The history of the Chinese people for a hundred years is a history of struggle to defend peace. Although the aggression that US imperialism has vigorously supported Chiang Kai-shek in carrying out in China has suffered a disastrous defeat, it refuses to learn its lesson and continues to endanger peace in the East and also endanger peace in the West. We Easterners will not yield to aggressors in order to defend peace. We cannot sit idly by while the Korean people suffer. US imperialists are following the old path of Japanese imperialism: to conquer Asia, you must first conquer China; to conquer China, you must first conquer Manchuria; to conquer Manchuria, you must first conquer Korea. MacArthur is trying to realize Tanaka Giichi's dream. But the Korean people will never allow it, and we Chinese people will never allow it either. In order to defend peace in Asia and the world, we must resist American aggression to the end.

	The Chinese people fully support the convening of the Second World Peace Congress. The Chinese delegation fully agrees with the recommendations in the report of Chairman Joliot-Curie of the World Congress Standing Committee, especially the one concerning the United Nations.

	This organization, established after World War II to safeguard peace and international security, has now become a barrier to protect aggressors and disrupt peace. The UN Charter has become a scrap of paper. The principle of unanimity among the great powers in the Security Council has also been undermined. This is precisely the reason why the United Nations has lost its reputation. We hope that the United Nations will be able to restore its reputation, get rid of the control of US imperialists, and work justly and conscientiously to benefit the peace-loving people of the world and safeguard their security, and not engage in activities to the contrary.

	To achieve this, it is necessary to abide by the UN Charter and the principle of unanimity among the five great powers, and to abolish all illegal resolutions that violate the Charter and the principle of unanimity among the great powers. The center of representation of the five great powers must include the legitimate representatives of the 475 million people of the People's Republic of China, and not the fake representatives of the Kuomintang bandits and a small group of people. Only by abiding by these conditions can the safety of the people of the whole world be gradually guaranteed.

	We hope that the United Nations will immediately take the necessary steps to achieve this goal. We are deeply convinced that all the peace-loving and war-opposing people of the world share the same hope.

	If the United Nations ultimately fails to meet these hopes, we will never stand idly by and watch peace be threatened and world peace be disrupted. We Chinese people are willing to work with the people of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, the Soviet Union, Poland, Vietnam, Korea, Mongolia and all other peace-loving people in the world to take more effective measures to defend world peace and security.

	The Chinese people have entrusted our delegation to submit five proposals to the Congress. We believe that these proposals are in line with the spirit of the Congress.

	We hereby submit the following proposals for the consideration of the Congress:

	1. End the aggression of the United States and other countries against Korea, demand the withdrawal of all foreign aggressor troops from Korea, and realize a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. This is the central key to the struggle to defend world peace today.

	2. Demand that the United States immediately stop any interference in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan.

	3. Demand that MacArthur be declared a war provocateur, the main creator of the Far East war of aggression and the main instigator of expanding the Korean War into a world war.

	4. Resolutely oppose the use of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, and demand that the government that first uses atomic weapons be declared a war criminal and sanctioned.

	5. Demand that all countries in the world simultaneously reduce armaments, establish effective controls, and suggest that the people of all countries assist each other in economic and cultural construction under conditions of peaceful coexistence.

	The last days of Hitler, Mussolini, and Hideki Tojo are still vividly before our eyes. Although those carrying the fascist bacteria are prone to forgetfulness, the people of the world have not forgotten. Those who oppose the people will be punished by the people. Those who oppose the people even more will be punished even more severely by the people. Whoever wants to combine the ambitions of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, the people's punishment they will receive will be the sum of the fates of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.

	Finally, on behalf of the entire Chinese people, I pay tribute to the peace fighters participating in the Congress, wish this Congress success, and use the combined people's power of the world to carry out a long-term immunization campaign against fascist bacteria, so that peace can achieve eternal victory.

	Long live the lasting peace of the world!

	Oppose the creators of new wars and the imperialist aggressors!

	Long live the great unity of peace-loving humanity!

　　郭沫若在世界和大演说全文
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社华沙讯：出席第二届世界保卫和平大会的中国代表团团长，在十八日下午会议上发表演说，演辞如下：
    主席先生、代表先生们：
    第二届世界保卫和平大会已经在华沙开幕了。我谨代表中国人民向波兰人民致敬，向波兰人民的伟大领袖贝鲁特致敬，并向波兰政府表示衷心的感谢。
    我们中国代表团以及东方其他国家的代表团，曾跋涉了一万公里的路程来到欧洲，我们本来是要到设菲尔德去，和英国人民握手的。但是我们现在却在华沙受到了欢迎。甚至我们在东方就曾经听说有某种“铁幕”存在了。但是我们在西伯利亚到东欧的旅途中却没有看见什么铁幕，而只是在不列颠海峡那边才终于发现了它。
    英国政府实际上阻挠了各国人民与英国人民会晤。这个政府由于害怕和平，便设法阻挠和平运动。但是从东方人民的观点看来，这是不足为怪的。今天在我们的东方，以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团，已经从阻挠和平事业走到了直接破坏和平，从叫嚣战争走到了侵略。美帝国主义在朝鲜的冒险侵略已经侵入到中朝边境。在侵略朝鲜的同时，美国又侵占我们的台湾，把我们的台湾海峡作为了美国的国防前线，并且侵入我国东北和山东的领空及山东的沿海，肆行轰炸扫射。美国公开地对于越南、菲律宾和东南亚各地的民族解放斗争，进行着肆无忌惮的干预和无情的镇压。
    美帝国主义在一面计划着侵略及干涉他国的内政，一面却伪善地宣称别的国家正在进行侵略。因而他们就硬说朝鲜人正在侵略朝鲜，中国人正在侵略中国的台湾，因而战争贩子们便自封为“救世主”，把他们的侵略行为说成为道义的援助，把他们的独霸世界说成为慈悲的救济。于是乎你在说保卫和平与安全，他们也在说“保卫和平与安全”，你在说争取自由与民主，他们也在说“争取自由与民主”，而且说要他们的才是货真价实的，你说的都是假的。美国的杜鲁门先生和艾奇逊先生最近不是都还在说，他们是我们东方人的好朋友吗？——哎，岂止是好朋友，简直是我们东方人的大恩人啦！
    五十年来，我们受着日本帝国主义的长期的侵略，由于国贼蒋介石的媚外卖国的政策终于招致了一九三七年以来的大举进侵，我们费了八年的艰苦抗战，算把日本帝国主义打败了。当我们在艰苦抗战的前期，首先而且唯一帮助我们的是苏联。美国呢？不断和日本帝国主义者打交道，把废铁、汽油、棉花、机器大量卖给日本人，让它们一转手用来屠杀我们，使我们牺牲了无法统计的生命财产。这就是美国“好朋友”所给予我们的“大恩惠”啦！
    日本投降后，我们中国人民渴望和平建设，然而美国却尽力扶植我们的国贼，以飞机、大炮、坦克、军舰、美元、美械、救济物资、剩余物资，尽量支持蒋介石攫取了我们海上、陆上、空中的无数权利，并嗾使蒋介石发动内战，使我们中国人民又不得不再忍受四年的牺牲，而终于赢得了今天的人民解放战争的胜利。倒是应该多谢美国“好朋友”，美国所给予蒋介石的一些飞机、大炮、坦克、军舰、美械、物资等大部分，都转移到我们人民解放军的手里来了。蒋介石成为了人民解放军的运输队长，美国成为我们的兵工厂。这就是美国“好朋友”所给予我们的“大恩惠”啦！
    而今天还在支持蒋介石的不正是美国“好朋友”吗？在大陆上的侵占虽然失败了，而却把我们的台湾抓在手里，把国防线移置到我们的台湾海峡里来，不正是美国“好朋友”吗？日本帝国主义者是我们不共戴天的敌人，然而在美国“好朋友”的保护扶植之下，一天一天的又要恢复它的本来面目了。这就是美国“好朋友”所给予我们的“大恩惠”啦！
    挟持着联合国，把联合国作为美国的私有品，以掩饰美国种种的犯罪行为。卵翼着没有一个中国人民支持的蒋介石的代表在联合国中来代表中国人民，而顽梗地拒绝我们中华人民共和国的真正的人民代表参加。这就是美国“好朋友”所给予我们的“大恩惠”啦！自然，美国“好朋友”会俨然地说：我们是尊重解决问题的民主方式的啦！联合国的一切决议是少数服从多数。是的，假使要从数字来讲的话，那点投票机器的操纵机关倒一戳就穿。参加联合国的六十个国家总人口是十八亿五千万，假使要尊重多数决议，投票时就请以人口的多少来计算吧。蒋介石在联合国有一票就只是代表着他自己和一小撮反动分子，而我们中华人民共和国四万七千五百万人则只有零票。这就是所谓解决问题的民主的方式啦！
    联合国是被美国帝国主义污辱了，特别是在侵略朝鲜的罪恶行为中把联合国的旗帜作为一片遮羞布，真真是十八亿五千万人民的大耻辱。美帝国主义的侵略朝鲜倒不是从本年六月才开始的。一九四五年日本投降后，美国即代替了日本帝国主义者占领了三八线以南的朝鲜南部。在不足五年的期间，美国资本占了南朝鲜资本总额的百分之九一·二三，独占了对外贸易，形成了巨额入超，把工业和农业都逼到了破产的边缘。例如机器工业的生产一九四九年的上半年比起日本统治时代的一九四三年只剩下百分之五。耕地面积比起解放前减少到百分之五五。结果，使以产米著名的南朝鲜变成为粮食不足。这又是美国“好朋友”对朝鲜人民的“大恩惠”啦！今天这“恩惠”更加扩大了，美国侵略军已经越过三八线，占领了平壤、元山，并迫近了鸭绿江边。美国的飞机每天都在轰炸北部朝鲜的和平的城市与乡村，扫射着和平的居民，老弱妇孺，而且已经屡次越过鸭绿江在我国东北和山东境内肆行轰炸扫射了。这就是美国“好朋友”所给予我们东方人的“大恩惠”啦！
    当然，我们在这里所说的，仅仅是说美国帝国主义侵略者，而不是说美国人民。美国人民，和各国人民一样，和中国人民一样，也是爱好和平，但他们是受美帝国主义者压迫和威胁的。
    好了，不再多说了，这些“大恩惠”是数不尽，说不完的。
    为了对照起见，让我们也说说对于苏联的观感吧。
    苏联对于我们中国人民是怎样呢？我们中国人民当然比杜鲁门、艾奇逊先生们知道得更清楚。苏联自十月革命成功以后，便自动地废除了帝俄时代的和我们缔订的一切不平等条约，一直不断地对我们的人民解放事业表示同情。
    我们中华人民共和国成立以后，苏联在第二天便和我们建立了国交。接着我们又缔结了中苏友好同盟互助条约，在东方共同防御帝国主义的侵略，共同保卫世界的和平与安全，在经济上文化上本平等互惠的原则尽量相互协助。这些也都是事实，不是一些骗子们的花言巧语所能改变分毫的。
    这对比还不够明显吗？苏联在帮助我们中国人民，而美国在帮助中国人民的屠户——蒋介石。苏联要和我们共同制止日本帝国主义的复活，而美国则拚命扶植日本帝国主义的复活来侵略我们，苏联协助我们和平建设，而美国则侵略我们的台湾，侵略我们的邻邦，威胁我们的国防，破坏着亚洲的和平，使我们不能安心建设。苏联尽力支持我们加入联合国，而美国则尽力阻挠我们加入联合国。苏联在联合国大会提出和平方案，而美国则操纵着联合国从事侵略。苏联用原子能改造自然，而美国却用原子弹唬吓全人类。苏联在进行斯大林格勒和古比雪夫的宏大水力发电站的建立，世界最长的土库曼运河的开掘，而美国则在全世界扩充军事基地，建立庞大的基地网，把自己的国防线越过了大西洋建立在西欧，越过了太平洋建立在我们的国土上。苏联在宣扬米丘林的学说，寒带多年生的小麦，而美国则在宣扬氢气弹，细菌战。这对比还不够明显吗？
    声带所放出的花言巧语，掩盖不了炸弹所造成的血腥罪行。在今天我们看得很清楚，美帝国主义者的词汇，一切都应该从反面来解释。美帝国主义者嘴里的“普遍道德”就是横行霸道，所谓“高尚理想”就是侵略野心，所谓“和平与正义”就是战争与独霸。奴役和屠杀是它们的“人类尊严”。轰炸和平的城市与乡村、扫射和平的居民和妇孺，就是它们的“生活的精神价值”。杜鲁门先生在九月二十四日联合国五周年的一天在大会上发表演说，也在喊“裁军”，但美国的军费预算的天文学数字，却一天天地增长着。此外，原子弹生产正在扩大，氢气弹的威胁正在增加。杜鲁门也在喊“保障人权”，但我们中国的学者钱学森在美被扣留，不准回国；回国途中的学者赵忠尧和他的两位学生，经过日本横滨时被麦克阿瑟绑票。所以美帝国主义者的“裁军”就是扩充军备，美帝国主义者的“保障人权”就是蹂躏人权。
    伪善者呀，你是徒劳的！今天我们也应该感谢你的反面的指示，凡是你所反对的正应该是我们所欢迎的，你所欢迎的正应该是我们所反对的。我们也认识得很清楚：作恶者的伪善，是善的力量已经压倒了他，使他不得不伪。帝国主义的蛮横并不表示它的坚强，而只表示它的脆弱。
    我们中国人民是爱好和平的，中国的两万二千三百余万的人民已经在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名，便是绝好的证据。但正因为我们爱好和平，所以我们坚决地反对侵略。对于威胁和平、扰乱和平、破坏和平的侵略者，我们的民族已经对它们作了一百年以上的斗争。一百年来的中国人民的历史正是一部保卫和平的斗争史。美帝国主义大力支持蒋介石，在我们中国进行的侵略虽然遭受了惨败，但它不肯接受教训，依然在东方危害着和平，在西方也危害着和平。我们东方人为了保卫和平是不向侵略者屈服的。朝鲜人民遭受着灾难我们不能坐视不理。美帝国主义者在东方走着日本帝国主义的老路：要征服亚洲必先征服中国，要征服中国必先征服满洲，要征服满洲必先征服朝鲜。麦克阿瑟正在企图实现田中义一的梦想。但朝鲜人民首先就决不允许的，我们中国人民也是决不允许的。我们为了保卫亚洲和世界和平，必须把对美国的侵略反抗到底。
    中国人民完全拥护召开第二届世界保卫和平大会。中国代表团完全赞同世界和大常设委员会约里奥—居里主席报告中的各项建议，尤其是关于联合国的一项。
    这个在第二次世界大战后为了保卫和平与国际安全而设立的机构，现在已经变成了掩护侵略者破坏和平的屏障。联合国宪章已形同废纸。安理会大国一致的原则也遭到了破坏。这正是联合国所以丧失其声誉的原因。我们希望联合国将能挽回它的声誉，摆脱美帝国主义者的控制，并将为造福全世界爱好和平的人民和保障他们的安全而公正地与一本良心地工作，而不从事相反的活动。
    为了达到这一点，就必须遵守联合国宪章及五大国一致的原则，必须取消一切违反宪章与大国一致原则的非法决议。五大国的代表中心须包括中华人民共和国四万七千五百万人民的合法代表，而不是国民党匪帮和一小撮人的伪代表，只有在遵守这些条件的情况下，全世界人民的安全，才可能逐渐得到保障。
    我们希望联合国能够为此目的立即采取必要的步骤。我们深信全世界一切爱好和平反对侵略战争的人民，也抱着同样的希望。
    如果联合国终于不能够满足这些希望，我们也绝不袖手旁观，坐视和平受威胁和全世界的和平受破坏的。我们中国人民愿意与英、美、法、意、苏联、波兰、越南、朝鲜、蒙古及世界上所有其他爱好和平的人民一道，采取更有效的办法，来保卫世界的和平与安全。
    中国人民已经嘱托我们代表团向大会提出五项建议。我们相信这些建议是符合大会的精神的。
    我们谨提出下列建议供大会考虑：
    一、结束美国和其他国家对朝鲜的侵略，要求从朝鲜撤退一切外国侵略军，实现朝鲜问题的和平解决。这是今天保卫世界和平的斗争的中心关键。
    二、要求美国立即停止对于中国人民解放台湾的任何干涉。
    三、要求宣布麦克阿瑟是战争挑拨者，他是远东侵略战争的主要制造者和将朝鲜战争扩大为世界战争的主要煽动者。
    四、坚决反对原子武器及其他各种大规模毁灭人类的武器的使用，并要求宣布首先使用原子武器的政府为战争罪犯而加以制裁。
    五、要求世界各国同时裁减军备，建立有效的管制，并建议各国人民在和平共存的条件下作经济文化建设上的相互协助。
    希特勒、墨索里尼、东条英机的末路，还活鲜鲜的呈现在我们的眼前，尽管法西斯细菌的荷菌者们容易健忘，但全世界的人民是没有忘记的。反人民者必将受人民的惩罚。加倍反人民者必将受人民加倍的惩罚。谁要把纳粹德国和皇道日本的野心合而为一，它所受的人民的惩罚也将是纳粹德国和皇道日本的命运总和。
    最后我谨代表全中国人民向参加大会的和平斗士们致敬，敬祝本届大会成功，以全世界通力合作的人民力量来进行长期的法西斯细菌的免疫运动，使和平得到永恒的胜利。
    争取全世界持久和平！
    反对新战争的制造者和帝国主义侵略者！
    爱好和平的人类的大团结万岁！
