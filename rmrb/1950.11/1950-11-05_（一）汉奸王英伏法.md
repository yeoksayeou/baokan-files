(I) Traitor Wang Ying Executed

The arch-traitor Wang Ying, laden with crimes, was executed in Beijing yesterday. This die-hard traitor, when our people's War of Resistance Against Japan entered a difficult period, when the entire nation was engaged in a life-and-death struggle against the Japanese invaders, openly surrendered to Japanese imperialism in 1940. Using the blood and sweat of the people of Suiyuan, he raised thousands of puppet bandits for the Japanese invaders, serving as the commander of the puppet Suiyuan-Western Allied Army, with the Japanese ronin Hisaki Kuki as his advisor, cruelly trampling upon the people of the Northwest. In 1941, patriotic soldiers in Wang's puppet army, in Linhe west of Wuyuan, were planning a revolt. The traitor Wang Ying shot four soldiers and carried out a bloody suppression. When the Japanese invaders surrendered in 1945, he accepted reorganization by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. That winter, Wang drove his troops into the Datong front, then the site of Chiang's anti-communist, anti-people efforts, and launched a frenzied attack on the liberated areas, once occupying Fengzhen and other places. Subsequently, he served as a lieutenant general advisor to the war criminals Li Zongren and He Yingqin. He suggested to the notorious secret agent Zheng Jiemin to "gather old troops and train an army," and drafted a method to "organize and train cavalry to guarantee Inner Mongolia." By August 1948, Wang even proposed the so-called "Opinions on Suppressing the Communists and Consolidating North China," dreaming of opening up the Jinpu Railway and controlling North China for Chiang.

Such a heinous traitor deserves death, and the people's court's verdict of execution is entirely appropriate.

Now, the aggressive flames of American imperialism have spread to our borders, and the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang are intensifying their sabotage activities against our mainland under the direction of their master, American imperialism. MacArthur is openly employing traitors as pawns in his aggression against our country. According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 4th, the main traitorous elements that MacArthur has rounded up include Ren Yuandao, Yang Zhonghua, Han Yunjie, and others. These traitors, serving as pawns of American imperialism, are continuing their criminal activities of betraying the nation. However, since the Chinese people have the determination and strength to defeat American imperialists, they also have the determination and strength to eliminate national traitors. If anyone dares to act rashly in front of the Chinese people, then no matter where they flee, the Chinese people will surely hunt them down and severely punish them!

### （一）汉奸王英伏法

　　（一）汉奸王英伏法
    恶贯满盈的汉奸王英昨日在北京伏法了。这个死心塌地的汉奸，当我国人民抗日战争进入艰难时期，全民族对日寇正作着生死斗争的时候，他于一九四零年公开投向日本帝国主义的怀抱，以绥远人民的血汗，为日寇豢养了数千伪匪，自己充任伪绥西联军司令，以日本浪人久杵为顾问，凶残地蹂躏西北人民。一九四一年，王部伪军中的爱国士兵，在五原以西的临河酝酿反正，汉奸王英竟枪杀四名士兵，进行血腥镇压。一九四五年日寇投降时，他接受了蒋介石匪帮的改编。当年冬天，王逆即驱策所部，投入当时蒋匪反共反人民的大同前线，疯狂地向解放区进犯，一度攻占丰镇等地。随后，他又充任战犯李宗仁、何应钦的中将参议。他曾向著名的特务头子郑介民建议“召集旧部编练军队”，并条拟“组训骑兵保障内蒙”的办法。至一九四八年八月，王逆更提出所谓《剿灭共匪巩固华北意见书》，梦想为蒋匪打通津浦，控制华北。
    像这种汉奸首恶分子，国人皆曰可杀，人民法院予以判决处死，是完全应该的。
    现在，美帝国主义的侵略战火已烧向我国的边疆，蒋介石残余匪帮正秉承其主子美帝国主义的意旨，加紧向我国大陆进行破坏活动。麦克阿瑟更公然起用汉奸，作为侵略我国的爪牙。据新华社四日消息，麦克阿瑟已搜罗到的主要汉奸分子，包括了任援道、杨仲华、韩云阶等人。这些充任美帝国主义爪牙的汉奸分子，正继续进行其出卖民族的罪恶活动。但是，中国人民既然有决心有力量打败美帝国主义者，也更有决心有力量消灭民族叛逆。如果有人胆敢在中国人民面前轻举妄动，那么，不管他逃到天涯海角，中国人民都一定要把他追捕归案，予以严惩！
