Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 18th. Since July of this year, the Public Security Department of the Hunan Provincial People's Government and local public security organs throughout the province have successively cracked multiple cases involving Chiang Kai-shek's special agents plotting armed rebellion and sabotage of economic construction, as well as concealed intelligence organizations, effectively suppressing the destructive activities of counter-revolutionary bandits. A total of more than 30 bandit leaders have been captured, including Yao Jinghuang and Wu Chun, the bandit "Commander and Deputy Commander of the Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," Zhou Jie, the "Commander of the Chinese Kuomintang Anti-Communist Self-Salvation Army," Jin Yuanliang, the "Commander of the Hunan People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," and Zeng Yanwu, the bandit "Captain of the Underground Work Team of the Ministry of National Defense Confidential Bureau." Various weapons such as radios, rifles, and grenades were seized. Accomplices in each case have registered and surrendered one after another.

Since the U.S. imperialism launched its war of aggression against Korea, special agents lurking within the province have made contact with special agent bandits who sneaked in from Hong Kong, Macau, and other places, and have targeted soldiers, hooligans, and former Kuomintang retired officers for development, vainly attempting to organize "underground armed forces" to carry out armed rebellion in a planned way, in order to disrupt our social order and undermine our various construction undertakings. In July and August, several riots occurred in the Changde Special District of the province. In September, arson by special agents occurred continuously at the Xiangtan Manganese Mine. All of these were promptly suppressed and extinguished by our public security organs and mine security personnel.

The Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents' conspiracy to carry out sabotage activities in Hunan Province has been powerfully attacked by our people's public security organs. Yao Jinghuang and Wu Chun, the bandit "Commander and Deputy Commander of the Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," and Zeng Yanwu, the bandit "Captain of the Underground Work Team of the Ministry of National Defense Confidential Bureau," and other ringleaders, eight in total, have been tried by the people's court and executed by firing squad with the approval of the Provincial People's Government. The ringleaders of the remaining cases are under strict interrogation.

　　湖南破获特务案多起
    首犯八名执行枪决
    【新华社长沙十八日电】湖南省人民政府公安厅及该省各地公安机关，自今年七月以来，连续破获蒋匪特务阴谋武装暴乱和破坏经济建设以及潜伏情报组织等案件多起，有力地镇压了反革命匪徒的破坏活动。先后共计捕获匪“反共救国军正副司令”姚景煌、吴椿，“中国国民党反共自救军司令”周捷，“湖南人民反共救国军军长”金远亮及匪“国防部保密局地下工作队队长”曾延午等匪首三十余名。缴获电台、长短枪和手榴弹等武器多种。各案胁从分子均纷纷登记自首。
    自美帝国主义发动侵朝战争以后，潜伏该省境内的特务分子，即与自香港、澳门等地潜入的特务匪徒取得联络，并以兵痞、流氓、前国民党退伍军官等为发展对象，妄图组织“地下武装”，有计划地进行武装暴乱，以扰乱我社会秩序，破坏我各项建设事业。该省常德专区七、八两月份曾发生暴乱事件多起，湘潭锰矿九月间曾连续发生特务分子放火，均经我公安机关及矿山保安人员及时予以镇压及扑灭。
    蒋匪特务分子在湖南省境的阴谋破坏活动，已遭到我人民公安机关的有力打击。匪“反共救国军正副司令”姚景煌、吴椿及匪“国防部保密局地下工作队队长”曾延午等首犯八名，已经人民法院审判，并经省人民政府批准执行枪决。其余各案首犯正在严厉审讯中。
