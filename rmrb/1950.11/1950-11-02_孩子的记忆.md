　　A Child's Memory
　　Xiang Zhen

　　As I led my seven-year-old daughter into Zhongshan Park, the loudspeaker broadcast a clear message: "Comrades who have not yet signed to defend peace, please come here to sign!"
　　"Let's sign a name, Xiao Pang," I said to my child.
　　"Sign what name?" the child asked. She was happily skipping along. She had only recently learned to write her own name.
　　"Sign to oppose the aggression of American imperialism."
　　"Why should we oppose?" she asked.
　　I explained it to her in detail, but she didn't understand. Korea, war, aggression, peace – this series of nouns filled with rich content were abstract and vague things in her mind.
　　After a while, the child stopped skipping and suddenly asked me:
　　"Mommy, is it opposing that 'Mister' who sent the child to the police station?"
　　"Which police station?" I asked, baffled.
　　"The one next to our school, in Chengdu, don't you remember?"
　　Yes, I remembered. This happened in Chengdu under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries.
　　One afternoon, I went to the kindergarten as usual to pick up my child. As we walked out of the school gate, we saw a new-style car parked on the road. A smug American – the children all called him "Mister" – was fiercely scolding a three- or four-year-old student, and like an eagle catching a chick, he grabbed the child and carried him under his arm towards the police station. The child flailed his arms, kicked his legs, struggled desperately, and cried loudly.
　　The "Mister," speaking broken Chinese, ordered the police to lock up this child. The "crime" of this child, who could barely walk steadily, was: throwing stones at his car!
　　The older children began to shout. They said that the child did not throw stones at the car but was hitting a grasshopper in the roadside bushes. But the police, under the instruction of the "Mister," stopped the students from speaking. The little "criminal" shrank back in fear, opening his mouth and crying loudly…
　　"Mommy, it's that police station, don't you remember?" the child pressed me.
　　I explained it to the child again, saying that our opposition to American imperialist aggression is also to protect the freedom of children, so that bad guys like that "Mister" will not come to bully us again. This time, the child understood. She held my hand tightly, skipping and saying, "Then let's go quickly, Mommy. I want to sign a name to oppose it! I'll get A Mao to sign too, and Xiao Lin too!"

　　孩子的记忆
    向真
    我领着七岁的女儿走进中山公园的时候，播音器传出清晰的声音：“未签名保卫和平的同志们，请到这儿来签名！”
    “去签个名吧，小胖，”我对孩子说。
    “签什么名？”孩子问。她很高兴地跳着走。她近来才学会写自己的名字。
    “签名反对美帝国主义的侵略。”
    “为什么要反对？”她问。
    我细细向她解释，她不懂。朝鲜、战争、侵略、和平，这一连串充满了丰富内容的名词，在她的脑袋里却是抽象模糊的东西。
    过了一会，孩子停止了跳跃，突然问我：
    “妈妈，是不是反对那个把小孩送到警察局去的‘密司脱’？”
    “哪个警察局？”我莫明其妙地问。
    “就是我们学校旁边的呀，在成都，你忘了？”
    是的，我想起来了，这是发生在国民党反动派统治下的成都的事情。
    一天下午，我照例到幼稚园去接我的孩子。我们刚走出学校的大门，就看见一辆新式的小汽车停在路上。一个神气活现的美国人——孩子们都叫他“密司脱”——正在凶狠地责骂一个三四岁的小学生，并且像老鹰抓小鸡似的一把狠狠抓住小孩，把他挟在腋下，向警察局走去。那孩子划着两手，踢着两脚，死命地挣扎着，大声哭叫着。
    “密司脱”说着生硬的中国话，命令警察把这个孩子关起来。这个连走路还走不稳的孩子的“罪状”是：用石子掷他的汽车！
    年岁较大的孩子们便嚷了起来。他们说这孩子并没有掷汽车，而是在打路旁草丛里的一只蚱蜢。但警察在“密司脱”的授意下阻止了小学生们的发言。那小“犯人”恐惧地瑟缩着，张开嘴巴大哭起来。……
    “妈妈，就是那个警察局呀，你都忘了吗？”孩子紧逼着问。
    我又向孩子解释了一遍，说我们反对美帝的侵略，也就是要保护孩子们的自由，不让那个“密司脱”一类的坏蛋再来欺侮我们。这一回，孩子懂了。她紧紧地拉住我的手，跳着说：“那未快走呀，妈妈。我要签一个名反对它！我叫阿毛也签，小林也签！”
