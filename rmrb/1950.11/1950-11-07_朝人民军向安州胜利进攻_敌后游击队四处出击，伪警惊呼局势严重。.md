Xinhua News Agency, 6th - TASS dispatch: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced in a battle report on the 5th that the People's Army units were engaged in fierce fighting with the US military and the South Korean army on all fronts.

    In the area north of Anju, the People's Army units continued their victorious offensive towards Anju. The enemy dispatched reinforcements to the front, attempting to stop the People's Army units.

    In the area north of Hamhung on the east coast, the People's Army units halted the US military's offensive with fierce counterattacks. In the area north of Bukcheong and Seongjin, the People's Army units are conducting defensive battles.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th - Korean People's Guerrilla units are widely active behind enemy lines, actively striking the enemy. According to a dispatch from the International News Service in Seoul on the 4th: The South Korean puppet police chief Kim Tae-sun admitted on the 3rd that there are currently 48,000 to 50,000 guerrilla units operating in the South Korean countryside, with "an average of twenty incidents occurring every day." The cable also quoted an official from the US Economic Cooperation Administration as admitting that due to the activities of the guerrillas, "in reality, it is impossible to go to three out of the eight provinces of South Korea to investigate the food situation." Kim Tae-sun exclaimed that "the situation is serious and is gradually deteriorating."

    In northern Korea, People's Guerrilla units are also attacking everywhere. A US Marine Corps spokesman said anxiously on the 4th that the guerrillas "are becoming more and more daring and their organization is much better" (United Press). A dispatch from the International News Service on the 3rd stated: "Guerrillas taking the offensive actually attacked a convoy of eight supply trucks belonging to the Marine Corps in broad daylight, only eight miles from Wonsan on the 2nd, and almost stole all the supplies." In Majon-ri, west of Wonsan, Marine Corps patrols were also attacked. A spokesman for the US 10th Corps admitted that in two attacks, the guerrillas killed a total of fourteen Marines and wounded twenty-three. The International News Service also stated that "several powerful guerrilla units are operating" not far from the headquarters of the US 10th Corps. On the evening of November 1st, a guerrilla unit of 500 people, relying on the cover of darkness, rushed down from the mountains and attacked a village only three miles from the Wonsan headquarters.

    The continuous attacks by the Korean People's Guerrilla units have caused great anxiety to the American invaders. According to a dispatch from the International News Service on the 3rd: The commander of the US 10th Corps, Almond, is "very concerned about the guerrilla activities in the mountainous areas of the east coast." Almond hurriedly ordered on the 2nd to "attack the guerrillas with the most effective methods." However, these so-called "most effective methods" are only to "search for experts in fighting guerrillas among the American troops in the world and send them to Korea immediately"; at the same time, adopt the most despicable means of training puppet troops to act as spies, attempting to infiltrate the People's Guerrilla units; and when these methods are still ineffective, "it may be necessary to borrow guerrilla experts from the British."

　　朝人民军向安州胜利进攻
    敌后游击队四处出击，伪警惊呼局势严重。
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部五日发表战报称，人民军部队在各战线上与美军及南朝鲜军展开激烈的战斗。
    在安州以北地区，人民军部队继续胜利地向安州进攻。敌人抽调援军到前线，妄图阻遏人民军部队。
    在东海岸咸兴以北地区，人民军部队以猛烈的反击阻止了美军的攻势。在北青与城津以北地区，人民军部队正在进行保卫战。
    【新华社六日讯】朝鲜人民游击部队在敌后广泛出动，积极打击敌人。据国际新闻社汉城四日电：南朝鲜伪警察长官金泰善三日承认，现有四万八千到五万名游击部队在南朝鲜乡间进行活动，“平均每天发生事件二十起”。该电又引美经合总署官员的谈话承认：由于游击队的活动，“南朝鲜八道中实际上已有三道不能前去调查粮食情况”。金泰善惊呼“局势严重，并且正逐渐恶化”。
    在朝鲜北部，人民游击队也四处袭击。美海军陆战队发言人四日焦虑地说：游击队“愈来愈大胆，组织也良好多了”（合众社）。国际新闻社三日电称：“采取进攻的游击队二日竟在光天白日之下，在离元山仅八英里处袭击海军陆战队的八辆给养卡车的输送队，并几乎抢走了全部给养物资”。在元山以西的马转里，海军陆战队的巡逻队也遭到袭击。美第十兵团发言人承认，游击队在两次袭击中，共击毙海军陆战队十四人，打伤二十三人。国际新闻社并称，在离美军第十兵团总部不远的地方，即有“若干强大的游击队在活动”。十一月一日晚，有一支五百人的游击队依靠黑夜的掩护，从山上冲下来，袭击了离元山总部仅三英里的一个村庄。
    朝鲜人民游击部队的不断出击，使美国侵略者焦虑万分。据国际新闻社三日讯：美第十兵团司令阿尔梦德“非常关怀东海岸山区里的游击队活动”。阿尔梦德已于二日慌忙下令“以最有效的办法攻打游击队”。但这些所谓“最有效的办法”，仅是在“世界的美军中寻找打游击队的专家，并把他们立即送往朝鲜”；同时采取最卑鄙的手段训练伪军充当奸细，企图渗入人民游击队中去；而在这些办法仍然无效时，“可能向英国商借游击专家”。
