　　In Coordination with the Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Home, Defend the Nation Movement
    Beijing Poetry Workers Hold Symposium
    Resolve to Strengthen Poetry's Propaganda and Mobilization Work, and Issue Declaration Protesting American Imperialist Aggression, Supporting the Korean People.
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Amidst the surge of nationwide popular anger at resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting the home, and defending the nation, Beijing's poetry workers, in order to further coordinate with this action, express their active attitude, and strengthen poetry's propaganda and mobilization work, held a symposium at the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles at 1:30 PM on the sixth. Attendees included Feng Zhi, Tian Jian, Lou Shiyi, Wang Yaping, Yan Chen, Bian Zhilin, Ruan Zhangjing, Zang Kejia, Lü Jian, and composers Ma Ke, cartoonist Ding Cong, and over twenty others. In a heated discussion, the participants unanimously agreed that when the flames of aggression are burning on the border of the motherland, poetry workers should actively take action, strengthen creation, and through this art form, widely and deeply publicize patriotism, internationalism, and the ideas of hatred, contempt, and disdain for American imperialism, and inspire the fighting spirit of the broad masses. They should write more "battle short songs" and mobilize poetry authors from workers and students, as well as comrades from the Quyi (Chinese folk art forms) circles, to engage in creation. The meeting also exchanged opinions on how poetry workers should cooperate with music workers and art workers, as well as organize works, publish, perform, recite, and broadcast, and decided to compile and print propaganda booklets of poems, songs, and paintings. At the same time, Feng Zhi, Wang Yaping, Yan Chen, Lou Shiyi, and others were selected to be responsible for organizing, coordinating, and editing and publishing, in order to further carry out creation and propaganda work. Finally, the "Declaration of Beijing Poetry Workers Responding to the Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect the Home, Defend the Nation Movement" was unanimously adopted.
