　　Strengthening Current Affairs and Political Education for the Communist Youth League
    Yang Shu
    I.

　　Our New Democratic Youth League already has 3.5 million members, and the members have played a significant role in various tasks. However, the revolutionary ideological and political education conducted among the members is insufficient, and the organizational life of the League in some places is relatively lax. As a result, some members do not demonstrate sufficient political awareness or practical struggle experience. At a time when the United States is flagrantly invading Korea, attempting to expand the war, and invading our Taiwan, bombing our Northeast, and seriously threatening our national security, many League members have demonstrated courage, firmness, discipline, and selfless fighting spirit. They have demonstrated the excellent qualities of the Communist Youth League members in practically participating in the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to protect the country; however, in some places, some League members have shown that their level of awareness is not high enough, such as prioritizing personal interests above all else, bowing their heads in the face of difficulties, and disobeying organizational resolutions. Therefore, under the current situation, strengthening the current affairs and political education of the Communist Youth League, raising the political level of the members, and establishing a belief in the inevitable victory of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to consolidate the League's organization is absolutely necessary.
　　There are many aspects to consolidating the League's organization, such as consolidating work in the current struggle and work, strengthening organizational life, and reviewing League cadres. This article only discusses the issue of strengthening current affairs and political education.

    II.

　　At present, the general spirit of the current affairs and political education of the Communist Youth League is: patriotism, internationalism, and collectivism. The content of education can include resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, consolidating revolutionary order, and consolidating the League's organization.
　　The propaganda and education of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea should be widely carried out among League members and young people. It is essential to raise their correct understanding of the current situation. Regarding the United States, efforts should be made to eliminate pro-American reactionary thoughts and fear of America in the youth masses, and to understand how to hate, despise, and scorn the United States. In carrying out this work, the fact that the United States is currently invading our country and the historical facts of its invasion of our country over the past century should be used to illustrate that U.S. imperialism is the sworn enemy of the Chinese people. The fact that the United States is a decadent imperialist country and the headquarters of reactionary degeneration in the world should be used to illustrate that U.S. imperialism is barbaric, reactionary, and despicable. The weaknesses of the United States, such as its political isolation, long battle lines, distant rear, and weak combat effectiveness, and the principle that atomic bombs cannot determine the outcome of war, should be used to illustrate that U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger. On the issue of aiding Korea, it must be explained that the Korean people's war against U.S. aggression is just, and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's assistance to the Korean people in fighting against the U.S. aggressors is a great and just action. The Korean people's war against U.S. aggression will surely achieve final victory. China's aid to Korea is a necessary action to strike at the common enemy of China and Korea - the U.S. aggressors, to protect our country's security, and to safeguard world peace.
　　In order to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, it is necessary to strengthen the education on consolidating the revolutionary order, that is, to strengthen the education on supporting the People's Government, supporting the people's democratic dictatorship, and strengthening the concept of the enemy. There should be sufficient vigilance against the enemy, and the view of resolutely and relentlessly fighting against counter-revolutionaries should be established. In order to suppress counter-revolutionaries, suppress espionage activities, oppose rumour-mongering by traitors, and oppose speculation by unscrupulous merchants, League members and young people should be taught the necessary knowledge in relevant work such as preventing spies, maintaining confidentiality, air defense, fire prevention, rescue, and vigilance.
　　In rural areas, education on strengthening local armed forces should be carried out, and in new rural areas, education on suppressing bandits and opposing local bullies should be strengthened. In areas where rent reduction and land reform are implemented, education on rent reduction and land reform should be widely carried out separately.
　　When the Communist Youth League carries out education on resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and consolidating the revolutionary order, education on consolidating the League's organization should be combined within the League. This kind of education should be conducted with examples in response to the thoughts of League members. The basic content of education is the education on the relationship between the individual and the collective. It is necessary to specifically solve the various ideological problems of young people regarding the motherland, internationalism, organization, family, lover, personal interests and aspirations, etc., based on the current situation. For example, if a League member says: "The motherland needs me, the family needs me, and the lover needs me, what should I do?" That is because they have not clearly recognized the correct relationship between the individual and the collective, and have not realized that the collective interest should be placed first, and the individual interest must be subordinate to the collective interest. For League members, education on organizational discipline is also needed. It is necessary to make League members understand that the League is not only a mass organization, but also an organization of advanced young people, and is different from general mass organizations. It is necessary to make League members understand the correct relationship between democracy and centralism and strengthen League members' organizational concept. Someone asked: There is such a young person who is ideologically progressive, works actively, and is willing to join the League, but is unwilling to obey the League's organizational resolutions and transfers after joining the League. Can he join the League? We answer: We must act in accordance with the League's charter, and such a person must not be allowed to join the League. In the past, some regions did not pay attention to the condition of obeying the League's organizational resolutions when developing League members, so the organizations of these Leagues were not very solid. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen education on organizational discipline within the League.
　　In the education on consolidating the League's organization, it is also necessary to educate League members to unite the broad masses of young people. To measure whether the League's organization in a certain area is consolidated, it is necessary to see whether that organization has taken root in the youth masses and the people's masses in that area. Therefore, it is necessary to educate League members to have a mass viewpoint in their thinking and to be able to combine with the masses in their work style, and never to be divorced from the masses.

    III.

　　When the Communist Youth League conducts current affairs and political education, the following points must be noted:
　　First: Current affairs and political education must proceed from reality and be directed at the problems that have arisen in the minds of League members and young people, with specific examples to give correct explanations. It is necessary to prevent generalization, uniformity, and only abstract interpretations of articles. At the beginning of the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, it is necessary to conduct several large reports analyzing the overall situation. But as the movement deepens, it will not work if there are still large reports. There must be thematic analysis of the situation and introduction of relevant necessary knowledge. In particular, it is necessary to be targeted at the ideological situation of League members and young people. For example, some students believe that American planes and cannons are powerful, and education should be carried out in response to this idea. Such facts can be cited: In the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War, the planes and cannons of Japan and Chiang Kai-shek were more powerful than ours, but the victor was us, not Japan and Chiang Kai-shek. From these kinds of facts, it can be explained that at the beginning of the struggle of the revolutionary people against the counter-revolutionary rulers and aggressors, the enemy's weapons and military technology are often superior to the people, but in the end, the revolutionary people always win.
　　Conducting current affairs and political education by using examples to address the problems in the minds of League members and young people is very effective. For example, those who have been abused by American aggressors can accuse American atrocities with their own experiences, and students who have studied in the United States can expose the darkness and sins of the United States with their own experiences. When carrying out this method, the facts they cite must be analyzed and explained to their significance, so that people not only have angry emotions, but also receive a deeper influence in their thinking.
　　Second: Conducting current affairs and political education, we must pay attention to gradually raising the consciousness of the masses based on their current level. Current affairs and political education is an extremely meticulous work, and it is impossible to make it work if we do not enlighten the masses' consciousness, go through the masses' own thoughts, and use simplified methods. Therefore, it is not only necessary to understand the problems that have arisen in the minds of the masses, but also to encourage them to express their own understanding, and to have full discussions with them to jointly reach correct conclusions. At the beginning, never rush to draw conclusions, but in the discussion process, be good at guiding and promoting correct opinions. By doing this, education can be in-depth. If conclusions are drawn for issues that have not been discussed at every turn in the discussion, and hats are put on people with wrong opinions, then everyone will inevitably remain silent and the effect of education cannot be achieved. For example, on the issue of the United States being a paper tiger, if the person presiding over the discussion puts forward the conclusion first, everyone will not use their brains to express their own opinions. But if a full and free discussion is launched, various different opinions will appear, such as some people think that the United States is not a paper tiger, if it were a paper tiger, how could it invade Korea and Taiwan? Some people also think that the United States is a paper tiger, which will be broken with a single poke, and it will be successful to overthrow American imperialism in a short period of time. Some people also say that neither of the above opinions is correct, and so on. In the heated discussion, everyone comes together to study and criticize various different opinions, so that the correct opinions can be promoted, and the result will be a more comprehensive and correct conclusion, knowing that although American imperialism is very powerful on the surface for a time, it still has insurmountable inherent weaknesses. These weaknesses are exposed more and more as its aggression expands, therefore it is still a paper tiger. But saying that the United States is a paper tiger does not mean that it can no longer harm the world. If all the people of the world work together, fight resolutely, and will be able to completely dismantle this paper tiger. For any problem, after a well-led and full discussion, the correct opinions are often more enriched, and the wrong opinions are systematically criticized.
　　Third: Current affairs and political education is a long-term process. It can and must be carried out widely in large-scale mass movements. However, it is impossible to complete this major task in one movement. The education of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea should be regularized, that is, it must be combined with regular work and life. Attention must be paid to transferring the enthusiasm of the masses to various specific tasks in a timely manner. Young workers, young farmers, and students, on the one hand, should be ready to undertake the tasks needed by the motherland at any time, and on the other hand, they must adhere to and strengthen their own production and study in the spirit of patriotism.
　　Finally, the current affairs and political education of the Communist Youth League should strive for diversification of methods in order to widely penetrate the masses. Various forms of propaganda and education, including various forms popular among the people, should be fully utilized. The leading organs of the Communist Youth League should write a large number of popular teaching materials (such as creating songs that can be popular throughout the country, etc.). Every League member has the responsibility to publicize to the broad masses at any time and anywhere. League cadres who are afraid of making mistakes in publicity and therefore do not publicize should be educated. We do not allow counter-revolutionaries to speak, because what they are carrying out is counter-revolutionary propaganda. But revolutionary elements should be asked to publicize more, because the propaganda of revolutionary elements is basically correct, even if there are individual problems that are said wrong, they can always pay attention to correcting them.
　　Comrades, the purpose of our Communist Youth League strengthening current affairs and political education is to consolidate the League's organization and further play its role, to make our League members not only a commando force in the cause of national construction, but also stand in the forefront in the actions against American aggression, defending the motherland, and strengthening national defense, is to strengthen our League members and youth's determination to resist and fight against the aggressors of American imperialism, and to contribute everything to the defense of the motherland.

　　加强青年团的时事政治教育
    杨述
    一
    我们新民主主义青年团已经拥有团员三百五十万人，团员在各种工作中起了很大的作用。但是，在团员中所进行的革命的思想和政治教育是不够的，有一些地方的团的组织生活也比较松懈，以致有一些团员在政治觉悟上，在实际斗争锻炼上，表现得不够。在目前美国大肆侵略朝鲜竭力扩大战争，并侵略我台湾，轰炸我东北，严重地威胁我国安全的时候，很多团员表现了勇敢坚定遵守纪律和忘我的战斗精神，在实际参加抗美援朝保卫祖国的工作时，表现了青年团员的优良的品质；但也有些地方的部分团员，表现了觉悟程度还不够高的现象，如把个人利益看得高于一切，在困难面前低头，以及不服从组织决议等不良现象。因此，在目前形势下，加强青年团的时事政治教育，提高团员的政治水平，建立抗美援朝必胜的信心，以巩固团的组织，是十分必要的。
    巩固团的组织的方法，是有许多方面的，如在当前斗争中工作中进行巩固工作、加强组织生活以及审查团的干部等，本文只谈加强时事政治教育这一个问题。
    二
    在目前，青年团的时事政治教育的总精神是：爱国主义、国际主义与集体主义。在教育内容上可以包含抗美援朝、巩固革命秩序与巩固团的组织等部分。
    抗美援朝的宣传教育，应在团内外青年中广泛地展开。提高他们对目前形势的正确认识。对于美国，应在青年群众中努力肃清亲美的反动思想，和恐美的错误心理，要懂得仇视、鄙视与蔑视美国。在进行这一工作时，应以美国目前侵略我国的事实、一百年来侵略我国的历史事实，来说明美国帝国主义是我国人民不共戴天的死敌；应以美国是腐朽的帝国主义国家、全世界反动堕落的大本营的事实，来说明美国帝国主义是野蛮的、反动的，是可鄙视的。以美国在政治上孤立，军事上具有战线长，后方远，战斗力弱等弱点与原子弹不能决定战争胜负的道理，来说明美国帝国主义是纸老虎。在援朝问题上，要说明朝鲜人民抗美战争的正义性，中国人民志愿部队援助朝鲜人民对美国侵略者作战，是伟大的正义的行动。朝鲜人民的抗美战争一定会得到最后胜利。中国人民援朝是为了打击中朝的共同的敌人——美国侵略者，是为了保卫我国的安全与保卫世界和平的必要行动。
    为了抗美援朝，必须加强巩固革命秩序的教育，就是要加强拥护人民政府，拥护人民民主专政的政权的教育，加强敌情观念，对敌人要有足够的警惕，建立和反革命分子作坚决无情的斗争的观点。为了镇压反革命，镇压特务活动，反对奸人造谣，反对奸商投机，应教给团员和青年在有关防奸、保密、防空、防火、救护、警戒等工作的必要的知识。
    在农村中要进行加强关于地方武装的教育，在新区农村中要加强关于剿匪、反霸的教育。在实行减租与土地改革的地区，要分别地广泛地进行关于减租与土地改革的教育。
    青年团进行抗美援朝与巩固革命秩序的教育时，在团内要结合进行巩固团的组织的教育。这种教育要针对团员思想以实例进行。教育的基本内容为：个人与集体关联的教育。要从目前形势下来具体解决青年对于祖国、国际、组织、家庭、爱人、个人兴趣与志愿等各种思想问题。比如：有个团员说：“祖国需要我，家庭也需要我，爱人也需要我，怎么办呢？”那就是没有认清楚个人与集体的正确关联，没有了解到应该把集体利益放在第一，个人利益必需服从集体利益。对于团员，还需进行组织性纪律性的教育。要使团员了解团不但是群众性的团体，并且是先进青年的团体，和一般群众团体是有区别的。要使团员了解民主与集中的正确关联，加强团员的组织观念。有人问：有这样的青年，他思想进步、工作积极、愿意入团，但不愿入团后服从团的组织决议与调动，他是否可以入团呢？我们答：必须按团章办事，这样人一定不能入团。过去的确有些地区发展团员时没有注意服从团的组织决议这一条件，所以这些团的组织就不很巩固。因此，在团内加强组织性纪律性的教育是必要的。
    巩固团的组织的教育中，还需教育团员团结广大青年群众。要测量某一地区的青年团的组织是否巩固，就要看那个组织是否在该地区青年群众与人民群众中生根。因此，要教育团员在思想上具有群众观点，在作风上能和群众结合，绝不能脱离群众。
    三
    当前青年团进行时事政治教育时，须注意下列几个问题：
    第一：进行时事政治教育，要从实际出发，要针对着团员与青年的思想中所发生的问题，以具体事例加以正确的说明。要防止一般化，千篇一律，防止只有抽象的条文的解释。在抗美援朝运动开始的时候，进行几次的分析全局的大报告是必要的。但随着运动的深入，如果还是大报告就不行了。那就要有对形势的专题分析，介绍有关的必要知识。特别是要针对团员与青年的思想情况。比如，有些学生认为美国飞机大炮厉害，即应针对这种思想进行教育。可以举出这样的事实，抗日战争与解放战争中，日本和蒋介石飞机大炮都比我们厉害，结果胜利的是我们，而不是日本和蒋介石。从这类事实中来说明当革命的人民向反革命的统治者和侵略者斗争的开始时期，敌人的武器和军事技术常常优越于人民，但是到最后总是革命的人民得到胜利。
    针对团员与青年思想中的问题，进行时事政治教育，用实例的方法是很有效的。如受过美国侵略者的凌虐的人以其亲身经历控诉美国暴行，在美国留学的学生以其亲身经历，揭发美国的黑暗和罪恶。进行这种方法时，还须把他们所举出的事实，加以分析，说明其意义，这样就使得人们不但有着愤怒的情绪，并且在思想上受到了较深刻的影响。
    第二：进行时事政治教育，要注意善于根据群众目前的水平逐步提高其觉悟。时事政治教育是一件极细致的工作，如果不启发群众的自觉，通过群众自己的思想，而用简单化的办法，是行不通的。因此，不只必须了解群众思想中所发生的问题。并且要启发他们说出自己的认识，和他们一起作充分的讨论，以共同达到正确的结论。在开始的时候，决不要忙于下结论，但在讨论过程中，要善于引导发扬正确的意见。这样做，教育才能深入。如果在讨论中动辄对于未经讨论的问题即下结论，对于有错误意见的人扣上帽子，那么，势必大家默默无言，不能收到教育的效果。比如：美国是纸老虎的问题，如果主持讨论者先提出了结论，大家就不会开动自己的脑筋，说出自己的意见。但如果发动充分的自由讨论，就会有各种不同的意见出现，例如有人认为美国不是纸老虎，要是纸老虎，怎么会侵略朝鲜、台湾？也有人认为美国是纸老虎，一戳即破，打倒美国帝国主义，短时期内即可成功。也有人说上述两种意见都不对，等等。在热烈的讨论中，大家一起来研究和批评各种不同意见，使正确的意见得到发扬，结果就会得到比较全面而正确的结论，知道美帝国主义虽然一时表面上很厉害，但因为它具有不可克服的内在弱点，这些弱点在它的侵略活动越扩大时，就越是暴露出来，因此它还是纸老虎。但说美国是纸老虎，并不是说它已不能为害于世界，全世界人民一致努力，坚决斗争，就能够把这纸老虎完全拆穿。凡是一个问题，经过有领导地充分地讨论，往往正确的意见更加充实，而错误的意见得到较有系统的批判。
    第三：时事政治教育是长期的。它可以而且必须在大规模的群众性的运动中广泛地进行。但是，不可能在一次运动中完成这一个重大的任务。应使抗美援朝的教育经常化，即必须与经常的工作与生活相结合。必须注意适时地将群众的热情，转到各个具体工作上去。青年工人、青年农民、学生，一方面应随时准备着担负起祖国所需要的任务，另一方面，又必须以爱国主义的精神坚持并加强自己的生产与学习。
    最后，青年团时事政治的教育，应力求方式的多样化，以便广泛地深入群众。各种宣传教育的形式，包括民间所流行的各种形式，应加以充分利用。青年团的领导机关，要大量编写通俗的教材（如创作能流行全国的歌曲等）。每个团员都有责任随时随地向广大群众宣传。对于怕宣传错了因而不宣传的团的干部，应该进行教育。对于反革命分子，我们不准他开口，因为他们所进行是反革命的宣传。而对于革命分子则要他们多多宣传，因为革命分子的宣传基本的看法是正确的，即使容或有个别问题说错了的，能够随时注意纠正就行。
    同志们，我们青年团加强时事政治教育的目的，就是要使团的组织巩固起来更进一步地发挥作用，就是要使我们团员不但在祖国建设事业中成为一支突击力量，而且在反对美国侵略、保卫祖国、加强国防力量的行动中站在最前列，就是要使我们团员和青年加强与坚定反抗美帝国主义侵略者的斗争意志，为保卫祖国而贡献自己一切的决心。
