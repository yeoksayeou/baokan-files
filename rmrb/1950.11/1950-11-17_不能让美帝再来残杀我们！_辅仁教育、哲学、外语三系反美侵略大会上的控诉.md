We Cannot Allow the American Imperialists to Massacre Us Again!
    — Accusations at the Anti-American Aggression Meeting of the Departments of Education, Philosophy, and Foreign Languages of Fu Jen University
    Fu Da Communications Group
    On the evening of the 13th, students from the Education, Philosophy, and Foreign Languages departments of Fu Jen University held an anti-American aggression meeting. At the meeting, students accused American imperialists of their crimes against the Chinese people. As soon as the floor was opened for free speech, three students stood up at once, vying for the first opportunity to speak. Ultimately, Liu Jiajun from the Foreign Languages Department spoke first. He said: "I grew up under the iron heel of the Japanese devils. I saw too much of the enemy's wanton burning, killing, raping, and plundering! At that time, the lives and property of the Chinese people were not guaranteed, and we lived in darkness. One early morning, a group of Japanese devils drove three compatriots onto a bridge and stabbed them one by one with bayonets, throwing them into the river. The river water was stained red with blood. They stood on the bridge and laughed. On a cold winter night, all the men, women, and children of our village were driven onto the ice to freeze… Now that the motherland has just been liberated and gained freedom, American imperialism, like the Japanese invaders, has come to trample on us again! Comrades, we were too miserably bullied by the imperialists in the past. Let's take action quickly!"

    The Inhumanity of Imperialism; The Japanese Invaders Burned, Killed, and Plundered Everywhere
    Philosophy student Song Guangyi walked onto the stage with clenched fists and gnashing teeth. He first slammed the table hard, then said: "I am Song Guangyi, a student in the Philosophy Department of Fu Jen University. Speaking of imperialism, I hate it to the core! Five years ago, I was a prisoner in the Japanese Central China Gendarmerie in Nanjing. I was sentenced to death twice by the enemy and dragged to the execution ground seven or eight times. I never thought I could live to this day, let alone see a free motherland. In the high tide of the movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend the country, I want to simply recount my bloody past to my fellow students. Because I was a student and had promoted resistance against Japan, I was arrested by the enemy. The enemy forced me to hand over the list of anti-Japanese students. When I refused, they tortured me severely. I remember the first time they whipped me and poured cold water over me. Although I was beaten until I was covered in blood, I passed out after a while, so I didn't feel much pain. The second time was even worse. First, they used red-hot branding irons to burn the skin all over my body, and the next day they peeled off the charred skin. This kind of torture was too inhuman. Covered in pus and blood, I was constantly crying and screaming. At this time, the enemy sent me to a pack of foreign dogs to be bitten. Not to mention being bitten, even being touched was unbearable! Comrades! People who have lost the protection of their motherland, people who are oppressed by imperialism, have no way to survive! I was imprisoned with several other young intellectuals. There were seven people in my group in total. The other six were all shot, leaving only me who never revealed any information. The enemy suspected that I had a background and wanted to find some information from me, so they sent me to the No. 1 Prison in Tiger Bridge, Nanjing. It was the "Prisoner of War Camp" set up by the Japanese invaders. I want to tell everyone an important thing: Comrades, bowing your head in front of imperialism will only bring you suffering! I always resisted the enemy strongly, and victory finally belonged to me. The "Prisoner of War Camp" in Nanjing was extremely tragic. People who were caught inside had to be searched first. Both men and women were stripped naked. Sometimes the translator spies would make the male and female "prisoners" hug each other naked, using all kinds of methods to mock us, treating us worse than dogs. When I saw that situation, I was extremely angry. I didn't eat anything for a day and cried all night. I will never forget that life of a subjugated slave! Comrades! Dear comrades! We must never let our motherland fall into the hands of imperialism. We have a sense of justice, we love peace, we love our motherland, and in order to defend peace and defend our motherland, we must fight the enemy—the imperialists—to the end! I am now covered in scars, my fingers have been broken, my front teeth have been knocked out, and more than one and a third inches of my rectum has been cut off. I was once insane, but my bones are still very hard. Under such trials, my will is stronger than before. Today, when we are beginning to live a happy life in a free motherland, the American imperialists do not want us to live a good life. They are following the old path of the Japanese invaders and invading our motherland again, wanting us to live the life of subjugated slaves again. Comrades! This is absolutely not allowed! As long as I am alive, I will contribute everything I have to the freedom, independence, and progress of my motherland!" In the middle of Comrade Song's report, some people were already sobbing softly, and then there was warm applause.

    In a state of extreme tension, Comrade Xiao Chunfu walked to the podium painfully and said: "My father ran a small business. During the War of Resistance against Japan, because the devils were robbing things, he stepped forward to plead, and was kicked to death with one kick. Later, because of the pressure of life, my mother became a prostitute. The devils often jokingly asked me, "Where did your father go?" I told them: "He's dead!" They said sternly: "No! No! You have many fathers!" I will never forget the humiliation the devils inflicted on me! Now, the American imperialists, like the Japanese invaders, want to make us live the life of slaves again, and I will not allow it! I will resolutely not allow it!" When he said that he would resolutely join the volunteer army, a storm of applause immediately shook the entire venue, and the flames of anger ignited the hearts of every student.

    The "Sino-American Cooperation Organization" is a Murderous Den; "Zhazidong" has Mountains of Corpses and Rivers of Blood
    Mr. Li Yinfeng then reported that he was the uncle of Zhang Shilin, a student in the Physics Department of this school. In 1947, he was arrested in Sichuan for opposing the Kuomintang and taken to the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization." The "Sino-American Cooperation Organization" was established by American imperialist spy chief Miles and Chinese spy chief Dai Li. It was the largest den for massacring communists and patriotic people. There were as many as forty-eight kinds of tortures inside. Mr. Li was imprisoned in "Bai Mansion" for two years and suffered six or seven kinds of torture. They wanted to get some information from Mr. Li, using all kinds of soft and hard methods, but they never got anything. Mr. Li said painfully: "As the situation became tense on the eve of the liberation of Chongqing, the reactionaries became even more vigilant about the prison. At that time, we knew that the closer Chongqing was to liberation, the more dangerous our lives would be. Because the reactionaries would not let us go. On the day the enemy retreated, around 6:00 p.m., the comrades imprisoned in "Bai Mansion" were dragged downstairs batch by batch to be executed by shooting. "Long live the Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" Loud slogans burst from the mouths of every patriotic person facing death. At half past twelve, only me and a man named Zhou were left upstairs. The enemy dragged the two of us downstairs to live with sixteen other prisoners. At that time, there was a guard who was from Henan. Because of our more than half a year of indoctrination, he had developed feelings for us, so he secretly told me: "The situation is tense! A complete massacre is now underway at "Zhazidong". If you wait another hour or two, you will be in danger!" I told him sternly: "We will naturally die, but you will not survive either! If you can rescue us, we can guarantee your lives." Because of this warning, he and three other guards accepted our plan and conspired to escape from prison. When the sixteen of us escaped, we encountered a burst of gunfire from the guards, which scattered us. I climbed up a mountainside with a lady. Although we were weak and couldn't run fast, the rapid liberation of Chongqing meant that the enemy didn't have time to chase us. All the comrades imprisoned in "Zhazidong" and "Bai Mansion," except for the sixteen of us who were able to survive, were ruthlessly massacred by the enemy!" Finally, Mr. Li firmly said: "Blood debts must be paid with blood. We should go to the battlefield to learn actual struggle!"

    Comrade Zhang Shilin's father and brother disappeared during the Kuomintang period. After liberation, there was no news of his father. His brother learned from the newspaper that he had been massacred in "Zhazidong" of the "Sino-American Cooperation Organization." He saw the scene of mountains of corpses and rivers of blood in "Zhazidong," but his brother was burned beyond recognition! Comrade Zhang Shilin recounted this experience intermittently. Infinite pain contained infinite anger. After a long time, he raised his head, raised his fist and said: "I want to avenge my brother, avenge the millions of victims, volunteer to join the army, and contribute everything I have!"

    Overseas Chinese Weng Wenhua from Malaya, and overseas Chinese Kao Xisong and Zhu Guangli from Vietnam, also painfully reported the situation of the British and French imperialists unreasonably shooting and killing overseas Chinese. They had only been studying in the capital of the motherland for two months, and now that they saw that the American imperialists were about to invade China again, they were filled with indignation and grief. They all firmly stated that they would definitely drive the American imperialists out of Taiwan and out of Korea.

　　不能让美帝再来残杀我们！
    ——辅仁教育、哲学、外语三系反美侵略大会上的控诉
    辅大通讯组
    辅仁大学教育、哲学、外语三系同学在十三日晚上举行了一个反美侵略大会。会上，同学们纷纷控诉美帝残杀中国人民的罪恶。自由发言一开始，为了争取首先发言，一齐站起来了三个同学。结果先由外语系刘嘉俊同学报告。他说：“我是在日本鬼子铁蹄下面长大的。敌人任意烧杀奸淫，我看到的真是太多啦！那时中国人民的生命财产没有保障，过的是暗无天日的生活。有一天大清早，一群日本鬼子把三个同胞赶到桥上用刺刀一个个挑下河里去，鲜血染红了河水。他们却站在桥上大笑。在一个深冬的寒夜里，我们全村的男女老少都被鬼子赶到冰上受冻……当祖国刚刚得到自由解放的今天，美帝国主义又像日寇一样来蹂躏我们啦！同学们，过去帝国主义欺侮的我们太惨了。赶快行动起来吧！”
    帝国主义惨无人道日寇到处烧杀掳掠
    哲学系同学，宋广仪是握着拳头，咬牙切齿走上台去的。他先狠狠地击了一下桌子，然后说：“我是辅大哲学系学生宋广仪。提起帝国主义来，使我痛恨极了！在五年前，我是驻在南京日寇华中宪兵队里的一个囚犯，被敌人宣判过两次死刑，拉到刑场七、八次。我没有想到我能活到今天，更没有想到能够看到自由的祖国。在抗美援朝保家卫国运动的高度热潮中，我要简单地向同学们诉一诉我血泪斑斑的往事。因为我是学生，宣传过抗日，所以被敌人逮捕了。敌人逼迫着我交出抗日同学的名单。我不交，他们就用严刑拷打我。我记得第一次是用鞭子打和灌凉水，虽然打得我鲜血淋漓，但是过一会儿就昏过去了，所以不大感到痛苦。第二次就更厉害了，先用烧红了的烙铁烫我的全身皮肉，第二天再揭掉烙焦了的那块皮。这种刑法太无人道了。脓血满身的我，时刻在哭涕喊叫。敌人这时又把我送到洋狗群里让洋狗咬我。不要说咬，就是碰一下也受不了的呀！同学们！失掉了祖国保护的人们，在帝国主义压迫下的人们，是没有什么活路的！我和几个知识青年被囚在一起。我那一组一共七个人。其余六个人都被枪毙了，只剩了我一个人始终没有说出口供。敌人更怀疑我有背景，想由我身上找到一些材料，于是把我送到南京老虎桥第一监狱。那儿是日寇所设的“俘虏收容所”。我告诉大家一句要紧的话：同学们，在帝国主义的面前低头是要吃亏的！我始终坚强的反抗敌人，胜利终于是属于我的。南京“俘虏收容所”里惨极了。被抓到里面的人们，首先要被搜查。不论男女都剥光了衣服。有时翻译特务们让男女“俘虏”裸体拥抱，用种种方法戏弄，把我们看得连狗都不如。我看到那种情形，我气愤极了。我一天没有吃东西，哭了一夜。我绝对忘不了那亡国奴的生活呀！同学们！亲爱的同学们！我们绝不能让祖国亡在帝国主义手里。我们有正义感，我们热爱和平，我们热爱祖国，为了保卫和平，保卫祖国要与敌人——帝国主义者斗争到底！我现在遍身是伤疤，手指被打断了，门牙被打掉了，直肠被切去一寸三分多。我一度疯了，但是我的骨头还很硬，在这样的磨炼下，我的意志比从前更坚强了。当我们在自由的祖国开始过幸福的日子的今天，美帝国主义者，不让我们过好日子，他踏着日寇的老路又来侵略我们祖国，要我们再过亡国奴的生活。同学们！这是绝对不能许可的！只要我活着，我一定要为祖国的自由、独立、进步贡献我的一切。”在宋同学报告的中间，已经有些人在低声啜泣，这时响起了热烈的掌声。
    在情绪万分紧张的情况下，萧春富同学沉痛地走上讲台说：“我爸爸开了个小买卖，在抗日期间，因为鬼子抢东西，他上前哀求，一脚被踢死了。后来因为生活的逼迫，母亲当了妓女。我时常被鬼子们开玩笑的问我“你爸爸那里去？”我告诉他：“死啦！”他们严厉地说：“不！不！你的爸爸多着哩！”鬼子对我的侮辱，我是永远不能忘记的！现在美帝又像日寇一样的想使我们再过奴隶的生活，我是不允许的！坚决不允许的！”当他说出要坚决参加志愿军时，暴风雨般的掌声立刻震动了全场，愤怒的火焰点燃了每个同学的心灵。
    “中美合作所”是杀人魔窟“渣滓洞”尸积如山血流成河
    李阴枫先生紧接着报告，他是本校物理系同学章士琳的舅舅，于一九四七年在四川因为反对国民党，而被抓到了“中美合作所”。“中美合作所”，是美帝特务头子美罗斯及中国特务头子戴笠设立的，是屠杀共产党人和爱国人民的最大的魔窟，里面的毒刑有四十八种之多。李先生在“白公馆”被囚了二年之久，受到毒刑有六、七种之多。他们想从李先生口里取得一些材料，用尽了软硬的一切方法，但始终没有得到什么。李先生沉痛地说：“当重庆解放的前夕，由于局势的紧张，反动派对于所里的防范就更加严密起来。当时我们晓得重庆越接近解放，我们的生命就越危险。因为反动派对于我们是不肯放手的。就在敌人撤退的那天，下午六点钟左右，囚禁在“白公馆”的同志们，就被敌人一批一批地拉到楼下去执行枪决。“共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”响亮的口号，从每一批临死爱国者的口中爆发出来。十二点半了，楼上只剩下我和一位姓周的。敌人把我俩拉到楼下去和十六个囚犯住在一起。当时有个守卫，他是河南人，由于我们半年多的感化教育，他对我们已经有了感情，所以他秘密地告诉我：“局势紧张啦！现在正在‘渣滓洞’进行全部枪杀。再等一两点钟，你们可就危险了！”我正颜厉色地告诉他：“我们自然是死，但是你们也活不了！假如你们能救出我们的话，我们则可保证你们的活命。”由于这样的警告，他和其他的三个守卫接受了我们的计划，同谋出狱。当我们十六个人逃出的时候，又遇到了警卫的一阵枪击，使我们各自分散了。我和一位太太一起爬到一座山腰里。虽然我们身体很弱，跑得不快，可是由于重庆解放得迅速，而敌人也就来不及追赶了。“渣滓洞”和“白公馆”所有被囚禁的同志们，除了我们十六个人得以活命外，其他同志都被敌人无情的残杀了！”最后，李先生坚决地说：“血债要拿血来还，我们应该到战场上去学习实际的斗争！”
    章士琳同学的爸爸和哥哥，是在国民党时期失踪的。解放后，爸爸没有信息，哥哥从报纸上知道被残杀在“中美合作所”的“渣滓洞”内。他看到“渣滓洞”尸积如山，血流成河的情形，但自己的哥哥被火烧得认不出来了！章士琳同学断续地诉说了这段经过。无限沉痛中含着无限的愤怒。半天他抬起头来，举着拳头说：“我要为哥哥报仇，为千千万万的死难者报仇，自愿参军，贡献我的一切！”
    从马来亚来的侨胞翁文华，从越南来的侨胞考锡松、朱广礼等也沉痛地报告了英、法帝国主义无理枪杀侨胞的情形。他们来到祖国的首都读书才两个月，现在眼看美帝又要侵略中国，他们慷慨激昂，悲痛万分。都坚决表示一定把美帝赶出台湾去，赶出朝鲜去。
