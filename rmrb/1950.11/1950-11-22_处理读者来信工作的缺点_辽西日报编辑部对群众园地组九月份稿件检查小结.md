Shortcomings in Handling Reader Letters
--A Summary of the Masses' Garden Section's Manuscript Review for September by the Editorial Department of Liaoxi Daily

Editor's Note: In order to study how to better handle reader letters and worker-peasant correspondent contributions, the Editorial Department of Liaoxi Daily had four members of the editorial board review the unused manuscripts of the Masses' Garden section for September. After research, the following opinions were compiled. This summary reflects some of the problems in handling reader letters and worker-peasant correspondent contributions and can be used as a reference. The method of centrally reviewing a specific important task like this is also worth introducing.

We believe that the Masses' Garden section's handling of the September manuscripts was basically correct, and most of the handling was appropriate. Some questions, such as the letter asking "Why don't the Hui people eat pork? Is it feudal and superstitious?" which are not issues that concern the masses, were rightly not answered. For some specialized learning questions, such as "What impact did the Opium War have on China?" telling them to refer to books (such as modern Chinese history) was also a good approach.

However, after reviewing in the spirit of the National Journalism Work Conference and the Northeast Bureau Propaganda Department's newspaper work conference, we feel that there are still some shortcomings that urgently need to be overcome:

I. Insufficient attention is paid to manuscripts that seem "fragmented" but actually concretely reflect the growth of new people in the new society. In the unselected manuscripts, according to incomplete statistics, there are 117 praising articles. Some of them could have been used at the time, but are now outdated. There are still 70 that are usable now (being sorted out, some have been published successively). Looking at the praised issues, there are 15 articles about militiamen, self-defense forces, district and village cadres, and peasants bravely capturing bandits at the risk of their own lives and guarding roads and expanding lines day and night. There are 12 articles about military families actively engaging in production without relying on government farming assistance, nine articles about workers and peasants diligently studying culture and enthusiastically running schools, as well as many examples of risking one's life to block floods and rescuing public property at the risk of personal and family safety, and enthusiasm for public welfare. The praised people are also very diverse, including workers, peasants, party members, league members, militiamen, self-defense forces, women, model workers, military families, students, teachers, doctors, and so on. Some of them are very touching, such as Comrade Liu Wenhai, a self-defense team member from a village in Liaozhong, who was forced by four bandits at gunpoint to lead the way to confiscate the village government's guns. In order to protect the village cadres and the safety of the entire village, when he reached the outside of the village government gate, he bravely dove into the small door and shouted "The bandits are coming!" which alerted the village cadres and self-defense team, and they drove the bandits away. Comrade Zhao Junfeng, a shop assistant from a cooperative in Shuangliao, saw bandits robbing cloth and money worth more than 5.9 million yuan. He chased after them regardless of his life. The bandits shot at him several times with pistols (fortunately, they didn't fire), but he was not afraid and remained about a dozen steps away from the bandits, shouting loudly "As long as I am alive, you won't be able to rob the cloth!" With the assistance of the police station chief, the bandits were captured. Yang Weili, the Party branch secretary of Gaoliban Village in Beizhen, disregarded his family's belongings and waded through chest-deep water to rescue the cooperative's goods. In addition, three communist party members and the masses used their bodies to block the water when they couldn't stop the flood. There are also some military family elders who do not want government preferential treatment, and get up early and work late, producing more grain than others. Some contracted farmers always prioritize the land of military families and take care of it carefully, producing more grain than when the military families cultivated it themselves. The military families are very grateful and write to their sons in the army, telling them to work hard in the army, and also write to the newspaper to praise the contracted farmers. Some farmers who were previously illiterate are now able to write letters because they actively learn culture. These are all good examples for the masses, and worthy of being praised in the newspaper. If we connect these together, they have profound significance, specifically and vividly reflecting the new face of the new society under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and the rapid increase in the awareness of the working people, especially the working class and the peasantry, and the growth of new qualities and new morals. If we do not simply focus on writing techniques when evaluating manuscripts, these manuscripts should be adopted.

Our newspaper's biggest shortcoming is that there are too many abstract concepts that are transmitted from top to bottom, and too few specific reports about the lives of the masses. For example, the changes in the countryside are mostly reflected by general figures such as the expansion of cultivated land area, increased output, and increased number of students (which is also necessary, of course), but we have neglected to reflect this aspect through a specific person or a specific event. Lenin said: "We still use too few vivid and specific examples and models from all aspects of life to educate the masses." This powerfully strikes at our shortcomings today. We often believe in the old way that only comprehensive, prominent, and typical models have guiding significance, and therefore we have not given due attention to some specific example materials that seem ordinary but do reflect the growth of new people in the new society and are easily accepted by the masses. For example, a worker who works and encourages other workers to work harder to oppose American imperialist aggression and defend peace, mobilized one hundred workers to sign their names during rest, which is not very prominent in terms of numbers compared to the thousands of peace fighters who signed in Shanhaiguan and across the country, but it is easier for ordinary people to emulate. It is right that we put most of our efforts into conducting criticism, and we are still not doing enough today, and we must fully develop it in the future, especially paying attention to developing bottom-up criticism in the widespread and unfettered development of worker-peasant correspondents, and focusing the attention of the broad masses of workers and peasants on our current main tasks. But at the same time, do not relax the timely commendation of model figures of the working people (including their activists - revolutionary cadres) who love the motherland and selflessly participate in the construction of all aspects of the country, because educating the masses through reports of the masses' various aspects of actual life and living examples is the most effective way to improve the masses' level of awareness and improve work.

II. We have not paid enough attention to researching the opinions and requirements of the masses in the incoming manuscripts and letters, and what difficulties they have and helping them to solve them. From the incoming manuscripts, the masses reflect many important issues related to the people's vital interests, such as production and policies, and put forward some valuable suggestions and criticisms. Because these more important issues have not been centrally studied, but rather handled in a scattered manner, they have not attracted attention.

Some districts and villages in five counties including Suizhong and Beizhen reported that malaria is very prevalent. It is widespread in the entire fourth district of Kangping, and more than 500 people in the sixth district of Suizhong have malaria. In a village in the third district of Panshan (the village name is unclear in the original mimeograph – editor), 80% of the people have malaria. More than 100 people in Lishuhe Shancun Village alone are sick, and some entire families are sick, seriously threatening the lives of farmers and affecting production. Various places have written to us asking us to tell them the methods of prevention and treatment. If we publish these in the newspaper and suggest that the Provincial Health Department or county hospitals send medical teams to treat them (and if necessary, send reporters), the newspaper will fulfill its role as a powerful assistant to the Party and the government.

On the government side, there are 33 articles on marriage issues, as well as some on the protection of private property (land, real estate) rights. For example, a letter asked who owns the land of a bachelor old man who dies in his sister's house? What if someone wants to redeem a house that was previously sold, but the current owner doesn't want to sell it back? If we publicly answer these specific questions in the newspaper in accordance with the provisions of our policies and laws, similar problems in other places can be solved, which will be the best way to implement the government's policies.

Many people have put forward some valuable suggestions and criticisms on production, public security, and other aspects. There are five articles about stealing livestock. In some cases, the stolen livestock were recovered because the self-defense team paid attention to guarding and patrolling, and in other cases, they were stolen because of carelessness. There are ten articles about preventing theft, fire, and livestock from harming crops. Before the autumn harvest, some people saw that the highway bridges were broken and the low-lying areas were uneven, and suggested that they be repaired quickly, all of which reflected some important matters in the current rural work. If we pay attention to research, we can write editorials as soon as possible to guide the work. There are also other individual useful suggestions that have not been processed.

There are also a number of manuscripts from farmers based on their own experiments and production experiences: How can you prevent wheat in the granary from becoming wormy? Seeds should not be placed in smoky rooms to avoid developing gray blight, etc. This will be more practical help to farmers than long-winded experience introductions.

The masses are very concerned about current affairs issues. There are a total of 87 reader letters protesting against American imperialism. From this, it can be seen that the mass anti-American imperialist aggression movement is quite widespread and in-depth. From factories, railways, and mines to rural areas, from schools to government agencies, armies, and enterprises, from mass organizations to reading groups, they have all written letters expressing their anger. This included six factories and mines, four villages, eight districts, three counties, seventeen primary and secondary schools, and nineteen mass organizations. The collective names of mass organizations and schools alone account for 27 letters. The main shortcoming of these letters is that the content is generally too broad to be adopted one by one. But if we do not measure them one by one, but put them together, we can see that they represent the extensive mass nature and the scale and depth of the anti-American imperialist aggression movement. Moreover, there are some that are not general, such as the workers of the Wufeng Quarry using more hard-working loading to oppose American imperialist aggression, and a farmer cadre even wrote such impassioned words: "I am a citizen of the People's Republic of China and a member of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. I support Mr. Malik's statement, and I demand that the Security Council immediately punish the American imperialist aggressors and order its invading forces to withdraw from China. The Chinese people resolutely demand the liberation of Taiwan and demand the expulsion of the Kuomintang's representative from the Security Council. Please forward the above to the Security Council and the American imperialist representative." These manuscripts can be published separately. In short, these manuscripts represent the voice of the broad masses and show the people's unparalleled love for the motherland. We have not considered the problem from this perspective, and we have suppressed these manuscripts, causing losses to propaganda work.

III. In terms of work methods, there is a lack of a certain system. The manuscripts kept for reference are not classified according to the issues, but rather all kinds of manuscripts are piled together. Some have already been used, such as the manuscripts about the harm caused by witch doctors and quacks, which were published as early as July, and are also mixed with the unused manuscripts of September. Some are written on the manuscript slip "Replied" or "Summarized," but it is not easy to tell whether it has been summarized or replied. Some issues (such as the issue of medical expenses for veterans) have been answered by the relevant authorities, but have not been forwarded to the readers. There are also manuscripts that the leaders have told to be processed and problems that need to be transferred to the relevant authorities for processing (such as the drug cost problem of Tai'an Yang Mingshu's arm damaged by acupuncture), and it is not noted on the stored letters and manuscripts whether they have been processed. In particular, regarding the manuscripts of criticism and replies, such as the criticism that the Yixian Grain and Native Products Company issued grain for the pre-purchase of cotton, which caused waste of the villagers' transportation costs due to poor planning, which was written by a reporter and published on the first page, and the company wrote back saying that it had been compensated in full and the masses responded well, we did not publish it. Some problems and criticisms and suggestions that are not of great value for publication, such as how come there is a lot of fine sand in the salt of a grain store? The amount of oil extracted by a village community is not enough, etc., although they may not be published, they can be transferred to the relevant authorities for processing. Some problems that have been published in our newspaper should not be "ignored," such as "What does the Schuman Plan mean?" should be transferred to the current affairs group for processing. Some manuscripts can be transferred to other groups for processing, such as the letters from model workers reporting on production, including Qi Baoen from Erlongshan Village, Shuangliao, a first-class provincial model worker, who wrote that they are using harvesters to harvest crops, and five people have learned to use them. Each machine can save ten man-days per day. Many villagers nearby come to see it, and those who thought that the harvesters were useless also said: People who use this thing for a long time will not want to use sickles anymore. Some can be used in the fourth edition, and some can be transferred to the rural group. This shows that the group urgently needs to establish a set of manuscript processing system based on actual needs in order to overcome this chaotic phenomenon.

The reasons for the above shortcomings are mainly two points: one is that there are shortcomings in the work methods, and the other (which is also the most important one) is the lack of considering problems from the perspective of the masses, and unilaterally opposing guidance and mass character. The latter has also existed in the leadership in the past. Of course, we also lack a certain amount of agricultural common sense. In terms of work methods, if some manuscripts reflecting important issues are not scattered, but rather concentrated together according to the issues (like the way we handled the manuscripts of witch doctors harming people in the past), and processed after analysis and research, we can see a very important issue. Such as malaria, anti-American imperialist aggression, stealing livestock, etc. In terms of criticism, there is a lack of a follow-up system, which has led to the failure to publish the problems that have been answered in a timely manner. Some manuscripts are written in a specific and vivid way due to the general content or more fragmented nature, and it is inevitable that they will not be properly processed when we lacked understanding of the mass nature of the newspaper in the past, but some manuscripts themselves are written specifically and vividly, and some can even be used without much work on the text, and it is wrong for us not to use them.

In the future, we must widely and unfetteredly develop worker-peasant correspondents. Due to the limitations of education level, it is impossible for them to improve the content and techniques of their letters and manuscripts at once. Therefore, we should strengthen our mass consciousness, give play to creativity, and use diverse forms to adopt the manuscripts of worker-peasant correspondents. We must advocate researching the important issues and the emotions of the masses in the current affairs. The classification of manuscripts should be divided according to the form, such as criticism, praise, questions and answers, etc., but it can also be divided according to the issues, because the masses may take various forms to write about a problem, such as the malaria problem, which may be suggestions or criticisms, or may be praise or questions and answers. If they are divided according to the form, they will be scattered, but if they are concentrated together, we can understand a problem that cannot be ignored. In handling criticism manuscripts, we can formulate a follow-up system based on the existing experience methods, and create more methods for handling manuscripts, so that our newspaper is full of the voices of the working masses.

　　处理读者来信工作的缺点
    ——辽西日报编辑部对群众园地组九月份稿件检查小结
    编者按：辽西日报编辑部为了研究如何更好地处理读者来信和工农通讯员来稿，由编委四人检查了该报群众园地组九月份的未用稿，经研究后整理出如下的意见。这个小结反映了一些处理读者来信和工农通讯员来稿中的问题，可供参考。而像这样集中检查某一重要工作的方法，也是值得介绍的。                      
    我们认为群众园地组对九月份稿件的处理基本上是正确的，大部处理的得当。对有些问题，如有的来信问“为什么回族不吃猪肉？是否封建，迷信？”等并非群众所关心的问题，不予解答，也是可以的。还有些学习中的专门问题，如问“鸦片战争对中国有什么影响？”告诉他参考书籍（看中国近代史）的办法，也是较好的。
    但根据全国新闻工作会议和东北局宣传部报纸工作会议的精神来检查一下，还感到有些急待克服的缺点：
    一、对于看来似乎“零碎”但实际却具体的反映出新社会新人物的成长的稿件注意不够。在不用的稿件中据不完全的统计有一一七篇是表扬的，有一部分虽在当时可用但现在已经过时，到现在仍然可用的有七十篇（正在整理有些已陆续发表）。就所表扬的问题看，有民兵自卫队，区村干部、农民不顾个人生死英勇捉匪和日夜巡查护路扩线的十五篇，军属不靠政府代耕积极生产的十二篇，工人农民努力学习文化和热心办学的九篇，此外还有在防汛中舍身堵水和不顾个人家庭冒生命危险抢救公家财产和热心公益事业等许多范例。被表扬者也很广泛，包括工人、农民、党员、团员、民兵、自卫队、妇女、劳模、军属、学生、教员、医生等等。其中有些是很动人的，像辽中某村的自卫队员刘文海同志被四个土匪用枪口逼着带路去缴村政府的枪，他为了保卫村干部和全村的安全，当走到村政府大门外时，奋不顾身的猛劲往小便门里一钻，可劲的喊“土匪来了！”才使村干和自卫队有所准备，打跑了土匪。双辽有一个合作社的店员赵俊峰同志，见土匪抢走价值五百九十多万元的布匹和钱财，就不顾命的随后追赶，土匪用手枪向他射击数次（幸好没打响），他毫不畏惧，始终离土匪十几步远，并大声喊“只要有我命在，你是抢不走布的！”在派出所长的协助下才把土匪捉住了。北镇高力板村支部书记杨维礼同志，不顾家里的东西，涉过顶胸口深的大水去抢救出合作社的东西，还有三个共产党员和群众见水堵不住就用自己的身子来挡水。此外还有的军属老大爷老太太不让政府优待，自己起早贪黑，比别人打粮还多。有的包耕户总是先尽军属地很精心的侍弄，比军属自己种时打粮还多，军属很感激，给儿子去信，要他在部队好好干，并给报社来信表扬包耕户。有的农民过去一个大字不识，因积极学文化，已经会写信了。这些都是群众的好榜样，值得在报上表扬，我们如果把这些联系起来看，确具有着深刻的意义，具体生动地反映了在共产党和人民政府领导下新社会的新面貌。劳动人民特别是工人农民阶级觉悟的迅速提高和新品质新道德的成长。如果我们衡量稿件的标准不单纯从写作技术去着眼的话，这些稿件是应该采用的。
    我们报纸最大一个缺点是抽象概念的由上往下贯的东西较多，具体的报道群众生活的东西则太少，比如农村面貌的改变我们是从耕地面积的扩大、产量提高、学生人数增加等一些总的数字来反映的多（当然这也是需要的），但忽略了通过一个具体人物一件具体事情来反映这一面。列宁说：“我们还很少用生活各方面的生动的具体榜样和模范去教育群众。”这正有力地击中了我们今天的缺点。我们常常老一套的认为全面的突出的典型的模范才有指导意义，因而摁把一些看来似乎平常，但确是反映了新社会新人物的成长，且容易被群众所接受的一些具体榜样的材料没有给予应有的重视。如一个工友一面作工一面鼓动工友加劲干活，来反对美帝侵略保卫和平，休息时就动员了一百多工友签了名，这和山海关及全国的动员几千人签名的和平战士来比，从数目讲是不太突出的，但他却更容易为一般人所效法。我们把绝大部分的力量放在开展批评上是对的，今天作得还很不够，今后还要充分的开展，特别是注意在广泛放手发展工农通讯员工作中开展自下而上的批评，并把广大工农群众的注意力集中到我们当前主要的任务上来。但同时也不要放松对劳动人民（包括其积极分子——革命干部）热爱祖国忘我地参加国家各方面建设的模范人物的及时表扬，因为通过群众各方面实际生活和活的榜样的报道来教育群众，才最能有效地提高群众的觉悟程度，改进工作。
    二、我们对来稿来信中研究群众的意见、要求和有什么困难帮助其解决注意不够。从来稿中群众反映出很多关系到人民切身利益的生产、政策等重要问题，和提出一些宝贵的建议和批评。由于没有把这些较重要的问题集中起来研究，而是分散的处理，所以也就没引起重视。
    绥中、北镇等五个县的一些区村反映疟疾流行很严重，康平四区普遍全区，绥中六区闹疟疾的有五百多人，盘山三区某村（村名原稿油印不清——编者）百分之八十的人闹疟疾。梨树河山村一个村就有一百多人，有的全家都病了，严重的威胁农民的生命和影响生产。各地纷纷来信要我们告诉预防和治疗的办法，假如我们把这些在报上予以公布，并建议省卫生处或各县医院派医疗小组，前往治疗（必要时并可派记者去），报纸就实现了党和政府有力的助手的作用。
    在政府方面，婚姻问题的三十三篇，还有些关于保护私有财产（土地、房产）权问题，如来信问光棍老头死在姐家其土地归谁所有？当出的房子想赎回不赎给怎么办？假如把这些具体问题按照我们政策法令的规定，在报上公开的给以解答，别地同样的问题便可得到解决，这将是贯彻政府的一个最好办法。
    不少群众提出了一些关于生产治安等方面的宝贵建议和批评。有五篇是偷牲口的，有的因为自卫队注意打更放哨被偷走的牲口又追回来，有的麻痹大意就被偷走了。十篇是防盗、防火、防牲畜祸害庄稼的。在秋收前有的见公路桥梁被冲断、低洼不平建议快补修，都反映了当前农村工作一些重要事项，我们如果注意研究就可及早写成言论，指导工作。还有其他个别有益的建议也没有处理。
    还有一批稿件是农民根据自己的实验出提的生产小经验：怎么样可以不使囤里的小麦生虫子？种籽不要放在有烟熏的屋子里以免生灰疸等，这比长篇大论的经验介绍对农民将会更有实际的帮助。
    群众对时事问题是非常关心的，抗议美帝的读者来信共八十七件。从中可以看出群众反美帝侵略运动是相当广泛深入的，从工厂、铁路、矿山到农村，从学校到政府机关、军队、企业，从群众团体到读报组，都来信表示了他们的愤怒。其中包括了六个工厂矿山、四个村、八个区、三个县、十七个中小学、十九个群众团体，光群众团体和学校用集体名义来的信就有二十七件。这些信的主要缺点是内容一般化，无法一一采用。但我们如不一篇篇去衡量他，而把他集中起来看，就可看出他代表了广泛的群众性和反美侵略运动的规模和深度。况且其中也有不一般化的，像五峰采石场工友用加劲装车来反对美帝侵略，有个农民干部甚至写着这样激昂的话：“我是中华人民共和国的人民，并且是中苏友好协会的会员，我拥护马立克先生的声明，我要求安理会立即惩办美帝侵略家伙叫它侵略军从中国退出去。中国人民坚决要求解放台湾，要求开除国民党在安理会的代表，以上请转安理会及美帝代表。”这些稿件就可以单独发表。总之，这些稿件代表了广大群众的呼声，显示了人民对祖国的无比热爱，我们没有从这个角度来考虑问题，把这些稿件压下来了，使宣传工作受到损失。
    三、在工作方法上缺乏一定的制度，留作参考的稿件没按问题分类，而是把各种稿件都堆在一起，有的已经用过，如巫医、庸医害人的稿件早在七月份即已发表，也与九月份不用的稿件混在一起，有的在稿签上写“复了”或“综合”，但是否已综合，答复了也不易闹清。有的问题（如关于荣军医疗费的问题）经有关机关解答了也未转给读者，还有领导上告诉处理的稿件和要转给有关机关处理的问题（如台安杨明书治针打坏的胳膊的药费问题），在存的信件和稿子上也没注明是否已经处理。特别是关于批评答复的稿件，如义县粮食土产公司发棉花预购粮，因计划的不周，浪费老乡的车工的批评，是记者写的，并刊在一版上，该公司来信说已如数赔偿，群众反映良好，我们也未登。有一些没有多大发表价值的问题和批评建议，如某粮栈的盐发现有很多细沙是怎会事？某村社的油提不够分量等虽不一定发表，但可转有关机关去处理。有些在我们报上发表过的问题不应该“不理”，如“舒曼计划是什么意思？”应转时事组去处理。还有的稿件可转别的组处理的，如劳模来信报告生产情况的，其中有省一等劳模双辽二龙山村的齐宝恩来信说：他们正用收割机收割庄稼，有五个人学会使了，每天一台能节省十个人工。附近很多老乡都来看，认为收割牋牋牋牋机不顶用的也说：这玩艺使长了都不愿使镰刀了。有的可在四版用，牋牋牋牋有的可转给农村组。这说明组里急需根据实际需要建立一套处理稿件牋牋牋牋的制度，才能克服这种紊乱现象。
    产生以上缺点的原因，主要有两点：一个是工作方法上有缺点，另一个（也是最重要的一个）是缺乏从群众角度来考虑问题，片面的把指导性和群众性对立起来，后者过去在领导上也是同样存在的。当然我们还缺乏一定的农业常识也有关系。在工作方法上，对一些反映重要问题的稿件，如果不是分散开来，而是按问题集中在一起（像过去处理巫医害人的稿件的办法）处理，经过分析研究就可看出一个很重要的问题来。像疟疾、反美帝侵略、偷牲口等问题。在批评方面缺乏追查的制度，致使已经答复的问题也未及时发表。有些稿件由于内容一般化或较零碎，在我们过去对报纸群众性缺乏认识的时候，处理不得当是难免的，但有些稿件本身写的具体生动，个别甚至在文字上不需加多少工即可用，我们没有用是不应该的。
    今后我们要广泛放手发展工农通讯员，由于文化程度的限制，他们在来信来稿的内容和技术上还不可能一下提高，所以我们应加强群众观念，发挥创造性，用多样的形式来采用工农通讯员的稿件。我们要提倡多从来稿中研究群众当前的重要问题和群众的情绪。对稿件的分类，一方面按形式分，如批评、表扬、问答等，但同时也可按问题分，因群众对于一个问题可能采取多样的形式写来，如疟疾问题，可能是建议的或批评的也可能是表扬的或问答的，如按形式分就分散了，要是集中起来就可使我们了解到一个不容忽视的问题。在处理批评稿件上可就现在已有的经验办法拟定一个追查制度，并多创造些处理稿件的方法，使我们的报纸充满工农大众的声音。
