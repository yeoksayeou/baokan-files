　　Resisting America and Aiding Korea to Defend Our Homes and Country Through Voluntary Action
    Beijing's Literary and Art Circles Issue Declaration
    Responding to the Joint Declaration of Democratic Parties
    [This newspaper's dispatch] In response to the joint declaration of democratic parties, Beijing's literary and art circles have issued a declaration to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country. The full text is as follows:

    We, the literary and art workers of Beijing, having seen the joint declaration of various democratic parties fully supporting the just demands of the people of the whole country to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country, are filled with indignation and boiling with enthusiasm. This is a voice of justice, a solemn oath. It represents the demands of the people of the whole country, it represents the united determination of all democratic parties to resist America and aid Korea, and it represents the strength of the victorious Chinese people.

    We warmly sympathize with the heroic anti-aggression struggle of the Korean people, and we hate the barbaric and bestial acts of the American imperialist planes and cannons indiscriminately bombing peaceful residents and destroying historical sites and culture; we vow to resist the aggressive acts of American imperialism with action. For nearly a hundred years, American imperialism has continuously carried out political, economic, military, and cultural aggression against our country. This is clearly laid out before the people of the whole country. Now, it is further advancing step by step, occupying our Taiwan, shelling our merchant ships, strafing and bombing our territory, and extending its evil claws into our borders.

    We can no longer tolerate it! Since the extremely ferocious American imperialists dare to be enemies of the peaceful people of Korea, China, all of Asia, and the whole world, we should swiftly, resolutely, and bravely resist and eliminate them! For the security and honor of the motherland, for the sake of defending the fruits of victory, for the sake of human peace, we are determined to fully launch the action of resisting America and aiding Korea to defend the motherland.

    We once had the glorious title of "engineers of the human soul." At this critical moment of peace and war, in this era of struggle between justice and barbarism, we must not tarnish this glorious title. We must raise our pens and begin our action. Each of our pens is a powerful weapon for resisting America and aiding Korea. We must use it to create various forms of works to resist America and aid Korea. Let every word, every note, every line in the works be filled with anger and strength, like bombs and bullets, to hit the enemy and inspire the people's enthusiasm for resisting America and aiding Korea to defend our homes and country.

    We must form a strong literary and art team, a large literary and art army to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country. We, the literary and art workers of Beijing, are willing to serve this great struggle to resist America, aid Korea, and defend our homes and country. We solemnly declare before the people of the whole country: We will contribute everything we have to accomplish this sacred task. When necessary, we are willing to put down our pens and take up guns to bravely kill the enemy. We must fight to the end to drive the American aggressors out of China, out of Korea, out of Asia, and to achieve true peace throughout the world!

　　以志愿的行动抗美援朝保家卫国
    京市文艺界发表宣言
    响应各民主党派联合宣言
    【本报讯】为响应各民主党派联合宣言，北京市文艺界发表抗美援朝保家卫国宣言，全文如下：
    我们北京文学艺术工作者，看到了各民主党派为全力拥护全国人民抗美援朝保家卫国正义要求的联合宣言，愤慨慎胸，热血沸腾。这是正义的呼声，庄严的宣誓。它代表着全国人民的要求，它代表着各民主党派团结一致抗美援朝的决心，它代表着胜利的中国人民的力量。
    我们热烈的同情朝鲜人民英勇的反侵略斗争，我们痛恨美帝飞机、大炮滥炸和平居民、摧毁古迹和文化的野蛮的兽行；我们誓以行动来反抗美帝的侵略行为。近百年来，美帝不断地对我国进行政治、经济、军事、文化侵略。清清楚楚地摆在全国人民的面前。现在更步步进逼，侵占我们的台湾，炮轰我们的商船，扫射和轰炸我们的国土，把魔爪伸进我们的国境。
    我们不能再忍受了，穷凶极恶的美帝国主义既然胆敢和朝鲜、中国、全亚洲、全世界的和平人民为敌，我们就应该迅速、坚决、勇敢的抗击它！消灭它！为了祖国的安全和荣誉，为了保卫胜利的果实，为了人类的和平，我们决以全力展开抗美援朝保卫祖国的行动。
    我们曾有着“人类灵魂工程师”的光荣称号，在这和平与战争的紧急关头，在正义与野蛮搏斗的年代，我们一定不能辱没这个光荣的称号。我们要举起我们的笔来，开始我们的行动。我们每一支笔，都是抗美援朝的有力武器，我们要用它来创作出各种形式的抗美援朝的作品。让作品中的每一个字，每一个音符，每一根线条都充满着愤怒与力量，像炸弹一样，子弹一样，去射中敌人，鼓舞起人民抗美援朝保家卫国的热情。
    我们要组成一支强有力的文艺队伍，组成一支抗美援朝保家卫国的文艺大军，我们北京市的文学艺术工作者，愿一齐为这个抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大斗争而服务。我们在全国人民面前庄严地宣誓：我们要为完成这个神圣任务贡献我们的一切。在必要时，我们愿意放下笔杆，拿起枪杆，来奋勇杀敌。我们要奋斗到底，驱逐美国侵略者出中国，出朝鲜，出亚洲，求得全世界的真正和平！
