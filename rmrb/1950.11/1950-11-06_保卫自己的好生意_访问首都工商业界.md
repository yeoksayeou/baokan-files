　　Defending Our Good Business
    ——Visits to Capital Industrial and Commercial Circles
    By our reporter Kang Weizhong
    During my visits to industrialists and businessmen in Beijing, I found that their hatred for American imperialism was like their hatred for the Japanese invaders. Because whether it was American or Japanese imperialism, both equally disrupted the stable lives of the Chinese people. People clearly remember that, especially since March of this year, with the unification of national finance and economy, prices have tended to stabilize, and the relationship between public and private sectors in industry and commerce has been initially adjusted, creating favorable conditions for the recovery and development of industry and commerce; but American imperialism is妄想ing to drag Chinese industry and commerce back into the quagmire of semi-colonialism. Therefore, hatred for American imperialism is shared by every patriotic industrialist and businessman. Manager Jia of Cihua Dyeing Factory recounted the tragic experience of his factory, which is inseparable from the history of imperialist aggression against China. However, he said: "Now his factory has recovered. After liberation, with the support of state-owned trading organizations, the factory has embarked on a path of gradual development. According to statistics at the end of 1949, the annual profit was 30 million yuan (RMB), and it is estimated that the profit this year will be even higher than last year. But what about the past?" Manager Jia recalled painfully: "During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, my factory was originally located in Gaoyang, Hebei. After the 'July 7th' Incident in 1937, Tianjin and Beijing fell, and then the Japanese invaders occupied Gaoyang. All of my factory's working capital was looted by the Japanese invaders, except for some dyeing and finishing machines that were rescued. The employees dispersed one after another, and the factory collapsed. A factory that had been established for many years and was initially scaled was destroyed by the Japanese invaders." He told me that after his factory was seized by the Japanese invaders, he became ill with anger, and all his teeth fell out in a very short time. Later, he spent a lot of effort and raised a sum of money, and finally moved the few remaining machines to Beijing to rebuild the factory; but Japanese imperialism was not reconciled. In the first year he moved the factory to Beijing, they first unreasonably bought it, and then forcibly invested in it. In order to deal with the wolves-hearted Japanese devils, Manager Jia said: "I don't know how many traitors I bribed, how many good words I said, how much money I spent, how many guests I invited... only then did I protect the factory." He said: "The painful lesson tells me that as long as imperialism rules in China, national industry and commerce cannot survive." He continued: "After Japan surrendered on August 15th, when the Kuomintang reactionaries ruled Beijing, prices rose sharply, urban and rural areas were separated, and American goods were dumped, and national industry and commerce entered a dead end. But after the liberation of Beijing, the situation of industrialists and businessmen has completely changed. The government called on all industrialists and businessmen to face the countryside, and state-owned trade provided various support to legitimate industrialists and businessmen. Urban and rural trade gradually recovered, and the colored cloth dyed by our factory also gained a broad market, so the business developed. At present, labor and management and employees in our factory are united and hope to do a good job in production." However, Manager Jia said angrily: "The more we want to do a good job in our industry, the more unhappy American imperialism is. In a word, American imperialism, like the Japanese devils, deliberately tries to destroy our industry and commerce and does not allow us to engage in peaceful construction. Now the American imperialist aggression against Korea is the prelude to the invasion of our country. The facts are very clear. American imperialist planes have repeatedly bombed and strafed our northeastern border and occupied our territory of Taiwan. These provocative acts are planned and should not be taken lightly. As a person who is enthusiastic about industry, I have suffered from the oppression of imperialism and I also know why we must resist the aggression of American imperialism." Manager Jia said: "I am willing to stick to my post, unite with all the employees, work diligently, do a good job in production, to consolidate national defense and smash the enemy's conspiracy; and I am willing to do my best to support the brotherly country of Korea." He said: "Only by defeating American imperialism can peaceful construction be possible."
    The mood of patriotic industrialists and businessmen is the same. They all agree that the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism are endless. At a forum of industrial and commercial circles held in the Third District of Beijing, a detailed study was made of why American imperialism is so prone to aggression. They believe that the purpose of American imperialist aggression is to seize markets for American tycoons. National industrialists and businessmen in our country have already deeply realized this in the past. Wang Junxiong, manager of Yongsheng Weaving Factory, and Jia Guiyi, manager of Longsheng Cloth Store, said: "In the past, during the rule of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries, Japanese and American cloths were sold cheaply in the market, and there was no share for us in the market. At that time, national industrialists and businessmen had no way out." After the meeting, Yin Minghuai, deputy manager of Fengyuan Milk Factory, further explained with vivid materials the losses his factory suffered under the dumping of American goods. He said: "At that time, American milk powder flooded the market, and 30 to 40 percent of my factory's regular production could not be sold. When there was no other way, we had to convert the milk into milk oil for sale. However, the manufacture of milk oil is both labor-intensive and difficult to sell; at the same time, the price is low. For example, a pound of milk costs 2,000 yuan, but a pound of milk oil made from a pound of milk sells for only 1,500 yuan. Milk oil is not widely used except for occasional use in Western restaurants and pastry shops, so sales are also difficult. At that time, there was almost no profit to be made." Manager Yin said affirmatively: "This is all the result of American imperialism's colonial policy towards China. But after liberation, American goods can no longer be dumped. Fengyuan Dairy Farm has also increased from 50 cows before liberation to 60 cows. Now milk sales have increased sharply and there is a large demand exceeding supply." Why is this? Manager Yin said: "Only when the country is independent and sovereign and foreign trade is in the hands of the people's country can national industry and commerce have a way out. However, American imperialism is arbitrarily expanding its war of aggression, directly threatening our country's independence and sovereignty. For ourselves and for the country, our industrialists and businessmen should assist Korea and crush the American aggressors' conspiracy."

　　保卫自己的好生意
    ——访问首都工商业界
    本报记者康伟中
    在我访问北京工商业者的时候，我发现他们对美帝的仇视有如对日寇的仇视。因为不论美帝或日寇，都同样破坏了中国人民的安定生活。人们全清楚地记得，特别自今年三月以来，全国财经统一，物价趋向稳定，工商业的公私关系作了初步调整，给工商业的恢复与发展创造了有利的条件；但美帝却妄想着把中国工商业拖回半殖民地的泥坑。因此，对美帝的憎恨是每个爱国工商业者所共有的。慈华挑染厂的贾经理叙述了他的工厂的悲惨遭遇，那是和帝国主义侵略中国史是分不开的。但是，他说：“现在他的工厂恢复了。解放后，该厂在国营贸易机关的扶植下，已走上日趋发展的道路。根据一九四九年底的统计，全年获利三千万元（人民币），估计今年获利较去年还要多。但是过去呢？贾经理苦痛的回忆着：“在国民党反动派统治时，我的工厂原设在河北高阳。一九三七年‘七七’事变后，平津沦陷，接着日寇侵占了高阳，我的工厂除营救下一部分染整机器外，全部流动资金被日寇扫荡净尽。职工相继离散，工厂从此倒闭。一个创办经年、初具规模的工厂就此被日寇一手摧毁了。”他告诉我，从他的工厂被日寇强夺后，他在气愤中得了病，在很短的时间内全部牙齿都掉光了。后来他费了很大的力气，筹措了一笔款子，终于将仅存的少数机器迁运北京复厂；但是日本帝国主义并不甘心，在他迁厂北京的头一年，先是无理收买，继又强行投资，为了应付狼心狗肺的日本鬼子，贾经理说：“我不知贿赂了多少汉奸，说了多少好话，花了多少钱，请了多少客……这才将工厂保下。”他说：“惨痛的教训告诉我：帝国主义在中国统治一天，民族工商业就休想生存。”他继续说：“八一五日本投降后，国民党反动派统治北京时，物价直线上升，城乡隔绝，美货倾销，民族工商业走入绝境。但是北京解放后，工商业者处境完全改变了。政府号召一切工商业面向农村，国营贸易又给正当工商业者以种种扶植，城乡贸易逐渐恢复，我厂染出的有色布也获得了广阔的市场，因此，业务发展起来了。目前我厂劳资、职工都团结一致，希望把生产搞好。”但是，贾经理愤怒地说：“我们的工业越想搞好，美帝就越不高兴，一句话，美帝和日本鬼子一样蓄心摧残我国工商业，不让我们和平建设。现在美帝侵略朝鲜就是侵略我国的先声。事实很显明，美帝派飞机三番五次轰炸和扫射我东北边境，侵占我国领土台湾等等挑衅行为是有计划的，决不可麻痹大意。作为一个热心搞工业的我，是深受过帝国主义压迫之苦的，也深知为什么必须抵抗美帝的侵略。”贾经理表示：“我愿守着自己的岗位，同全体职工，团结一致，兢兢业业，搞好生产，以巩固国防，粉碎敌人阴谋；并愿尽自己力量支援朝鲜兄弟国家。”他说：“只有把美帝打垮，和平建设才有可能。”
    爱国的工商业者的心情是一样的，他们都一致认为美帝的侵略野心是无止境的。对于美帝为什么会侵略成性，在京市三区召开的工商业界座谈会上曾作了详细研讨。他们认为美帝侵略的目的是为了给美国大亨攫夺市场，我国民族工商业者对这一层，在过去已经是体会得很深了。永生织布厂经理王钧雄、隆盛布店经理贾桂一说：“过去，在日寇及国民党反动派统治时，日寇同美帝的布匹廉价地在市场竞销，市场上没有我们的份儿了。当时，民族工商业者是没有出路的。”逢源牛奶厂副经理尹铭槐在会后更以生动的材料，说明他的厂子在美货倾销下所遭受的损失。他说：“当时，美国牛奶粉充斥市场，我厂厂内经常剩余产量的百分之三十至四十销售不出去。没有办法的时候，只有将牛奶改制成牛奶油出售。但是，牛奶油的制造既费人工，又难销售；同时价格又低。譬如一磅牛奶二千元，但用一磅牛奶炼成的牛奶油却只卖一千五百元。牛奶油除西餐和点心铺零用之外，一般用途不广，故销售也感困难。那时几乎没有利润可得。”尹经理肯定地说：“这都是美帝对中国实行殖民地政策的结果。但解放后美货不能再倾销了，逢源奶厂由解放前的五十头牛也增加到六十头牛。现在牛奶销量激增，大有供不应求之势。”这是为什么呢？尹经理说：“只有国家独立自主，对外贸易掌握在人民国家手里，民族工商业才有出路。可是，美帝肆意扩大侵略战争，直接威胁着我国的独立自主，我们工商业者为了自己，为了国家，应该援助朝鲜，粉碎美国侵略者的阴谋。”
