    Beijing Engineering Section Condemns American Imperialist Crimes
    We Will Never Allow Imperialism to Slaughter Our Compatriots Again
    [Our Newspaper] The entire staff of the Beijing Engineering Section of the Tianjin Railway Bureau held an anti-American grievance meeting on November 8th. Many workers, based on the harm and humiliation they suffered from American and Japanese imperialism in the past, angrily condemned and exposed the atrocities committed by the imperialist invading forces against the Chinese people. Lian Runchen, an old worker who has worked on the railway for more than 20 years, tearfully recounted: "Since the invasion of China by the Eight-Nation Alliance, we Chinese have been living under the oppression of imperialists, especially the brutal actions of the Japanese and American bandits, which were the most cruel." He said: "I once saw American soldiers pretending to be drunk, crushing more than a dozen rickshaws in front of a hotel. The rickshaw pullers went to the police, but the police, because they were foreigners and had privileges, hid to the side and dared not interfere, so the damage to the rickshaws was for nothing. During the Japanese puppet regime, when I was a track worker in Chadian, I was often beaten by the Japanese foreman for no reason. Once, my finger joints were dislocated from the beating. When I was cooking in the Beijing Engineering Section, the number of times I was beaten and scolded by the Japanese for no reason was countless. It can be said that no one working together at that time was not beaten around by the Japanese. To put it bluntly, they did not treat us Chinese as human beings at that time. All this, I know, is because our territory was occupied, we had no country, no home, and therefore no individual. At that time, we could only swallow our anger and live like cattle and horses, hoping that one day China would be independent and autonomous, so that we could avenge ourselves. Also, my son was forced by the Japanese to wander outside for more than 20 years and could not return home until last year when we were liberated. Only then did my son return with his wife and grandchildren, reuniting our family. I have to thank the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for this kindness. If Chairman Mao and the Communist Party had not led the liberation of all of China, how could we have today? Now that we are just about to live a few peaceful days, the American bandits are invading us again. I know that imperialists are all the same, each one more hateful than the last. I have already tasted enough of the suffering the Japanese gave me in the past. This time, we Chinese have stood up. I have to exert my old strength and I am not willing to be bullied by them again and suffer their inhumane atrocities. I am almost sixty years old this year. How many more sixties will I have? Even if I am not called to the front line, I, Old Lian, will step up production in the rear to support the front. This time, I must avenge this and win back this breath."
    Following him, bricklayer Zhi Hongqing said indignantly: "The brutal oppression I personally suffered from the enemy cannot be fully described in a few words. I once saw the Japanese 'sweeping' Xiaojing Village in Jingxi, and raping more than twenty women who were hiding in the temple. Once when I was working at the airport, a worker was buried alive upside down by the Japanese because he had a nail in his pocket. As for electric shocks, waterboarding, and beatings, they had become commonplace. Imperialists kill Chinese people and enslave Chinese people, treating them worse than grass, trees, cattle, and horses. The Japanese soldiers were like this, and the American soldiers will be even more brutal. Now that we have the People's Government, we have unity, and we will never allow the American devils to approach our door. Now, my first wish is to join the Volunteer Army. I told my seventy-year-old mother about this yesterday. Dying in the army and having the flag of a honored serviceman planted on our door is also an honor for you, and it is also my way of fulfilling my filial piety to you. If I don't join the army, it is hard to guarantee that bombs won't fall on my head if the enemy comes. Now, she has already agreed. I am quietly waiting for the transfer. I will go wherever I am needed. In the production post, I will put all my strength into it. Even if one person can't do the work of three, I will do the work of two." At the meeting, some comrades who did not have the opportunity to speak also expressed their opinions in writing. Some people shouted: "We must unite closely, turn hatred into strength, settle old scores with imperialism, and repay blood debts with blood!" Everyone unanimously guaranteed: "We must work hard, repair the lines well, and go wherever they are damaged to repair them. Even if bombs fall from the sky, we must repair them immediately, so that the people's railway transportation will not be interrupted." (Beijing Engineering Section Communication Group)

    北京工务段控诉美帝罪恶
    决不许帝国主义再来残杀同胞
    【本报讯】天津铁路局北京工务段全体职工于十一月八日举行反美诉苦大会，许多工友以过去所遭受美、日帝国主义残害、侮辱，愤怒地控诉和揭露了帝国主义侵略军所施于中国人民的暴行。在铁路上工作了二十多年的老工友连润臣哭诉着说：“我们中国，自打八国联军进攻中国起，一直就在帝国主义者的压迫下讨生活，尤其是日美强盗的暴行，最为惨酷。”他说：“我曾亲眼看见美兵装着喝醉酒，在一家酒店门口踏坏了十几辆洋车。车夫找警察，警察因为他们是外国人，有特权，躲到一边都不敢管，车子就算白踏了。日伪时期，我在茶淀当道班工人，就时常无故的遭日本工长的毒打。有一次手指头都被打的脱了节。在北京工务段做饭，受日本人无故的打骂，更是无从计数。当时在一起工作的可以说没有一个不被日本人打来打去的。干脆的说，他们当时没有把我们中国人当成人。所有这些，我知道，就是因为我们国土沦陷，没有了国，没有了家，也就没有个人。那时，我们只有忍气吞声的过着牛马奴隶的生活，指望着有一天中国能独立自主，好报仇雪耻。还有，我的儿子，被日本人逼迫流落在外，有二十多年不能回家，直到去年解放了，我儿子才带着媳妇孙子回来了，使我们一家孩子大人团聚。这我得感谢共产党毛主席的好处，若是没有毛主席共产党领导着解放全中国，我们那儿能有今天呢？现在我们刚刚要过两天太平日子，美国强盗又来侵略我们，我知道帝国主义都是一样的东西，一个比一个可恶，过去日本人所给我的苦难，我早就尝够了。这次我们中国人已经站起来了，我可得卖卖老力气，决不甘心再受他们的欺压和惨无人道的暴行。我老连今年快六十了，我还能有几个六十？即便不叫我上前线，我老连在后方，也要加紧生产，支援前方，这回非报了这个仇，争回这口气不可。”
    紧接着有瓦工支鸿卿忿恨的说：我个人遭受敌人的暴行压迫，更非三言两语可以说完。我曾经看到日本人在京西小井村“扫荡”，把藏在庙内的二十多个妇女给全奸污了。还有一次在飞机场工作，有一个工人因为衣袋中带了一个钉子，就被日本人给活生生的倒栽葱活埋了。至于用电刑，灌水，遭毒打，已成了家常便饭。帝国主义者杀害中国人，奴役中国人，不如草木，不如牛马。日本兵是这样，美国兵会更加残暴。现在我们有了人民政府，我们有了团结，我们决不允许美国鬼子接近我们的大门。现在我第一的志愿是参加志愿军，这事昨天已和我七十岁的老母亲说过，参军而死，荣军的旗子插在咱们的门上，您老人家也有光荣，也算我对您老人家尽了孝心。假设不参军，敌人来了，也难保炸弹不往头上落。现在，他老人家已经答应了，我静等着调动，用我到那儿我就到那儿。在生产岗位上，我要把全副力量拿出来，我一个人即便不能顶三个人干也要顶两个人去干。会上，一些没机会发言的同志也都纷纷用书面表示了自己的意见。有的人高呼着：我们要紧密的团结起来，把痛恨变成力量，向帝国主义算老帐，血债要血来还。大家并一致保证：要努力工作，修好了线路，那里坏了那里去修，就是天上落炸弹，我们也要马上修好，不使人民的铁路交通停断。  （北京工务段通讯组）
