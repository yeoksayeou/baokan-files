　　Chiang Kai-shek Gangster Special Agents Commit Atrocities on Mauritius Island
    Overseas Chinese Express Extreme Anger
    Special Agents Tore Up the Five-Star Red Flag and Beat Up Many Overseas Chinese

    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Mauritius Port Louis Chinese Commercial Daily, the Kuomintang on the island, through the Chamber of Commerce under its control, convened various overseas Chinese organizations on October 10th to hold a "National Day Celebration Assembly" in the Chamber of Commerce. After the meeting, Kuomintang special agents led two or three hundred henchmen to commit atrocities at the New China Middle School in the port. Upon arriving at the school, the special agents took down the five-star red flag flying on the flagpole and tore the flag to shreds. Subsequently, some people destroyed all four display cases in the school, while others beat up overseas Chinese Lin Zhihong and Lin Dichang, who were at the school on business, and sought out and beat nearly ten teachers, staff, male and female students of the New China Middle School. After committing the atrocities, these special agents shouted slogans and threatened to commit atrocities at the Chinese Commercial Daily. Because the Chinese Commercial Daily was prepared and reported to the police for protection, the special agents did not succeed. After the incident, student parents and overseas Chinese went to the New China Middle School to investigate and expressed extreme indignation at the Kuomintang special agents' atrocities. The Chinese Commercial Daily also published an editorial condemning the crimes of the Kuomintang special agents and calling on overseas Chinese to unite to oppose those who endanger overseas Chinese.

    [Another report] On the same day that special agents beat up teachers and students of the New China Middle School, the president and editor-in-chief of the Chinese Commercial Daily, while passing in front of Wang Zhongmin's store in the port, was stopped and beaten by Wang Zhongmin and others, resulting in facial injuries.

　　蒋匪特务在模里斯岛行凶
    侨胞表示万分愤怒
    特务曾撕毁五星国旗殴伤华侨多人
    【本报讯】据模里斯岛路易港华侨商报载称：该岛国民党曾于十月十日利用其把持下的商会、召集各侨团在商会中举行“庆祝国庆大会”，会议完毕后，国民党特务即率同与会爪牙二、三百人，至该港新华中学行凶。特务们到达该校后，就把升于旗杆上的五星旗降下，把旗撕成粉碎。此后，一部分人把校中的四面揭示橱全行捣毁，另一部分人则殴打了因事到该校的侨胞林志宏和林迪长，并寻殴新中教职员与男女学生近十人。这些特务在行凶后，并大呼口号要到华侨商报行凶。因华侨商报早有准备，报告警方派警保卫，特务乃未得逞。事件发生后，各学生家长及侨胞纷至新中查看，都对国民党特务暴行表示万分愤恨。华侨商报并发表社论，痛斥国民党特务罪行，并号召侨胞一致团结，反对危害侨胞。
    【又讯】与特务殴打新中教职员及学生之同日，华侨商报社长兼总编辑，路经该港王仲民商店前时，即被王仲民等拦住殴打，致面部受伤。
