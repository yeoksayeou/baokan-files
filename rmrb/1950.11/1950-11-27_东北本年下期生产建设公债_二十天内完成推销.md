    【Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 25th】 Since the commencement of promoting and selling the Northeast Region's 1950 second phase production and construction bonds (calculated in kind) on the 3rd of this month, as of the 23rd, various locations have essentially completed their subscription plans and are now entering the payment stage.

As of the 23rd, the amount paid for bonds in Shenyang City had reached more than 47 percent of the subscribed amount. In Harbin City, out of 132 industrial and commercial sectors, 113 had completed their subscriptions by the 22nd and were conducting payment competitions.
