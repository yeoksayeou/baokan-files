　　Prepare to Write Letters of Condolence and Send Comfort Goods to the Korean Aid Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army
　　[Our Newspaper] Primary school teachers in various districts of Beijing are actively participating in the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country. Currently, they have shifted from studying current affairs to various propaganda activities. At the beginning of the movement, teachers first listened to reports, read materials, and conducted studies through forums and discussions. The enthusiasm for learning is very high. Many teachers who did not care about current affairs in the past are now reading newspapers. During morning meetings and classes, they use stories to tell students about the atrocities of American imperialism and the facts of American imperialist aggression against China. A few schools even went to the streets to conduct propaganda. They also conduct parent forums or evening gatherings with the theme of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, accusation meetings for faculty and staff, and evening gatherings with adult night school students and some citizens.
　　On the morning of the 19th, the central primary school in the eighth district held a parent forum with more than 500 parents attending. The school exhibited more than 200 propaganda cartoons and art and craft works jointly created by teachers and students. Class teachers presided over parent forums in each class. Then, a propaganda meeting to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea was held. Students performed skits and sang songs. The parents were very moved. A parent who was a businessman said: "Our China has just become strong, and we will never allow American imperialism to invade again!" On the afternoon of the 17th, more than 400 teachers from the third district held a propaganda meeting to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country. A large slogan was posted at the entrance of the venue: "Tell the children to never forget the brutal crimes of American imperialism; teach the students well and never let the next generation be slaves again." At the meeting, the Tsinghua University Propaganda Team performed recitations and skits, and Zheng Zhixue, a student of the Overseas Chinese from Beijing Normal University, and teachers Zhang Baihua and Luo Xiuru made accusations. At the meeting, many teachers cried with grief and indignation. Zhang Baihua, the principal of Beixinqiao Primary School, accused: When she was in Chongqing, she and a colleague surnamed Zhang walked to the entrance of the Guangdong Restaurant on Ciqikou Street, and happened to see the American army destroying the hotel and chasing and beating the workers. When the American soldiers saw them, they grabbed her colleague and took her away in a jeep. It was not until four days later that she was sent back from the American military camp in Gele Mountain. These beasts had stripped her clothes off, locked her in an empty room, and raped her in turns for four days and four nights. She passed out several times. It took three months of treatment before she could get out of bed. Another time, American soldiers raped two sisters to death, and in order to destroy the evidence, they threw the bodies on a hillside near Shangqingsi. She also said: After the 'August 15' victory, American soldiers rode on the necks of Chinese people during the celebration parade, waving torches wildly, and throwing kerosene torches at women and children, burning them and causing them to scream. The beasts laughed loudly. Teachers from Dafosi Primary School, Xiang'er Hutong Primary School, and the First Central Primary School in the Third District also held accusation meetings. Li Boru, a teacher at Qian Yuansi Primary School who had been teaching for 37 years, said: 'Although I am old, I still want to fight the American robbers!' On the 21st, more than 400 primary school teachers in the fourth district held an accusation meeting, and student propaganda teams from North China Middle School, Fourth Middle School, and the Department of Engineering of Peking University performed skits and poetry recitations. On the 21st, more than 500 primary school teachers and more than 300 amateur supplementary school teachers in the fifth district held a propaganda meeting to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. At the meeting, two overseas Chinese students, a Korean student, and three primary school teachers accused the American and Japanese imperialists of their atrocities. After the Korean student Cui Shuying made her accusation, the meeting shouted: "Avenge the dead, long live the unity of the Chinese and Korean people!" The conference passed a letter to Chairman Mao and letters of condolence to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army.
　　After the accusation meetings, many teachers in various districts told their students about the atrocities of American imperialism that they knew in classrooms and morning meetings. Most teachers are more actively preparing to visit students' parents or hold parent-teacher conferences to conduct propaganda to parents and educate children, and prepare to write letters of condolence and send comfort goods to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

　　京市各区小学教师
    开展各种宣传活动
    召开控诉会学生家长座谈会并
    要向援朝志愿部队暨朝鲜人民军写慰问信送慰劳品
    【本报讯】京市各区小学教员积极参加抗美援朝保家卫国运动，目前已从时事学习转入各种宣传活动。运动开始时，教师们首先听了报告，阅读了材料和通过座谈会、讨论会进行了学习。学习情绪均甚高涨。很多过去不关心时事的教员，现在也看报了。他们在朝会上和上课时，利用故事的方式向学生讲美帝的暴行和美帝侵略中国的事实。少数学校还到街头去宣传。他们并进行以抗美援朝为内容的家长座谈会或晚会，教职员控诉大会以及与成人夜校学生及一部市民举行晚会。
    十九日上午，八区中心小学举行家长座谈会，到有家长五百多人。校内展览了二百多件由教员和学生共同创作的宣传漫画和美术劳作作品。级任教员主持各班的家长座谈会。接着举行抗美援朝宣传大会。学生演出了活报剧和歌咏等节目。家长们很受感动，一位经商的学生家长说：“我们中国刚强盛起来，决不允许美帝再来侵略！”十七日下午，三区教员四百余人举行了抗美援朝保家卫国宣传大会。会场门口贴着一副大标语：“要告诉孩子永远不忘美帝的残暴罪行；要教好学生决不让下一代再作奴隶”。会上有清华大学宣传队演出朗诵诗和活报剧，及北师华侨郑之学同学、教员张百华、罗秀如等的控诉。会上，许多教师都悲愤得哭了。北新桥小学校长张百华控诉说：她在重庆时，有一次她和一个姓张的同事走到磁器口大街广东酒家门口，正碰见美军捣毁酒店，追打工友。当美军看到她们时，就把她的同事抓上吉普车带走。四天之后才把她从歌乐山美军兵营送回。这些兽兵曾把她的衣服剥光，关在一间空屋里，轮流强奸了四天四夜。她几次死了过去。后来医治了三个月才能下地。又有一次美军兽兵奸死了两姊妹，为了灭迹，将尸体丢在上清寺那边一个山坡上。她又说：‘八一五’胜利后，美军在庆祝游行时，骑在中国人的脖子上，拿着火把乱耍，把煤油火把耍到女人和小孩头上，烧得乱叫。兽兵们却哈哈大笑。大佛寺小学、香饵胡同小学、三区一中心小学等校老师也都举行了控诉会。前圆恩寺小学教员李博儒已经教了三十七年书，他说：‘我虽然老了，我还要去和美国强盗拚命！’四区小学教员四百余人在二十一日召开了控诉大会，并有华北中学、四中及北大工学院的学生宣传队，演出了活报剧和诗歌朗诵。五区五百多小学教员和三百多业余补习学校教员，在二十一日举行抗美援朝宣传大会。会上有两个华侨学生和一个朝鲜籍的学生及三个小学教师控诉美帝和日帝的暴行。当朝鲜同学崔淑英控诉后，会场高呼：“为死难者复仇，中朝人民团结万岁！”大会通过给毛主席的信，和给中国人民志愿部队与朝鲜人民军的慰问信。
    在控诉之后，各区许多教员在课堂上和朝会上，都把自己所知道的美帝的暴行告诉了学生。大部分教员更积极地准备访问学生家长或开家长联席会向家长进行宣传，向儿童进行教育，并准备给朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿部队写慰问信、送慰劳品。
