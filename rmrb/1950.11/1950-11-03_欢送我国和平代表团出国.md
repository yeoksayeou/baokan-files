　　Seeing Off Our Peace Delegation Abroad
　　Our Correspondent Tan Wenrui
　　Just as American imperialism is launching a frenzied aggression in Asia, and the flames of war are approaching our borders day by day, just as the Chinese people's movement to defend world peace is entering a new stage, the people of the capital, with solemn and incomparable feelings, are seeing off our peace warriors to participate in the grand meeting of world peace defenders.
　　On the afternoon of October 29th, more than 6,000 people in the capital held a farewell meeting. Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman of the China Peace Committee, pointed out: "True peace is not something that can be obtained by asking, but must be strived for and defended by us. The Chinese people not only have the determination to defend peace, but also have the strength to defend peace." Today, when world peace is facing serious threats, we can more easily understand this truth. The Chinese and Korean people are both peace-loving nations, but the American bandits do not allow us to live in peace. They have launched an armed aggression in Korea, occupied our territory of Taiwan, and repeatedly violated our airspace, endangering our lives and property, and obstructing our peaceful construction. Moreover, they want to further expand the war of aggression and provoke a world war. Now the Korean people are waging a heroic battle to defend their own peace and defend world peace, and the Chinese people and peace defenders all over the world must not sit idly by. We must stop the war-mongers' aggressive conspiracy!
　　Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, reported on the work of the past year of the China Peace Committee, the merger of the China Peace Committee and the China Anti-Aggression Against America and Aid Korea Committee, and the significance and preparations for participating in the Second World Peace Congress, pointing out that the vigorous development of China's peace movement is due to the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, which has given the people great patriotic and internationalist education.
　　Since the establishment of the China Committee for the Defence of World Peace on October 2nd, the day after the founding of the People's Republic of China last year, the Chinese people's movement to defend world peace has unfolded in an organized and rapid manner. Especially after the American imperialists launched aggression against Korea and Taiwan, the Chinese people's movement to defend world peace has become more closely integrated with the anti-aggression movement. The peace signature campaign launched in May of this year has been responded to by more than 200 million people to date. At the same time, the movement against American imperialist aggression and supporting the Korean people is surging across the country. The two major organizations leading the Chinese people in defending world peace and opposing American imperialist aggression have merged into a powerful headquarters, which shows that the Chinese people not only recognize the inseparability of defending peace and opposing aggression, but also see the new direction of the struggle to defend world peace - to defend world peace, we must first oppose American imperialist aggression.
　　The achievements of our peaceful construction in the past year and the signatures of more than 200 million people on the peace declaration all prove the Chinese people's desire for peace. And our history of struggle against American imperialism, as well as the roar of opposition to American imperialist aggression issued throughout the country today, show the Chinese people's resolute will and powerful strength to not fear war. At the farewell meeting for the delegation, representatives of workers, women, youth, students and people from all walks of life unanimously expressed that people from all walks of life across the country are currently not only intensifying their work in their own positions to strengthen the country's strength with practical actions, but are also ready to accept the tasks instructed by Chairman Mao and meet the invading enemy.
　　The peace delegation, composed of dozens of outstanding representatives of the Chinese people, accepted the entrustment of 475 million compatriots on the eve of heading to the front line of peace: to tell our comrades of our determination and powerful strength to resolutely fight for the defence of world peace, and also to tell our enemies. We must point out the current facts of American imperialism's aggression against Korea and Taiwan, we must put forward concrete suggestions for defending peace, we must nominate MacArthur, Matthews, Acheson and others as war-mongers, and we must strengthen the unity between us and the peace-loving people of the world a hundredfold in this grand meeting of peace, and struggle to smash the conspiracy and actions of imperialist war-mongers to launch wars of aggression and undermine world peace.
　　"The fog of London cannot shroud the sunlight that shines on the earth." The Executive Bureau of the World Peace Congress has decided to hold the Second World Peace Congress in Sheffield as scheduled, and representatives of the people of 73 countries are reporting one after another. Our delegation has embarked on its journey with the solemn entrustment of 475 million people. When we said goodbye at the station, our well-wishers repeatedly urged them to strive to complete the sacred task of expanding and strengthening the unity of world peace forces. Head of the delegation Guo Moruo also solemnly stated that he would definitely live up to the entrustment and expectations of the people of the whole country. We believe that they will return victoriously, not only because they have the strong support of the people of the whole country, but also because their activities will be warmly supported by hundreds of millions of peace defenders around the world.

　　欢送我国和平代表团出国
    本报记者谭文瑞
    正当美国帝国主义在亚洲发动疯狂侵略，战火日渐迫近我们国境的时候，正当中国人民保卫世界和平运动进入新阶段的时候，首都各界人民以庄严无比的心情欢送我们的和平战士参加世界和平拥护者的大会师。
    在十月二十九日下午，首都六千多人举行了一个欢送会。中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会彭真副主席指出：“真正的和平不是要求可以得来的，而是要靠我们去争取和保卫，中国人民不但有保卫和平的决心，而且有保卫和平的力量。”在世界和平受着严重威胁的今天，我们更容易体会这一真理。中国人民和朝鲜人民都是爱好和平的民族，但是美国强盗不让我们和平地生活，在朝鲜发动了武装侵略，霸占着我们的领土台湾，并多次侵犯我国领空，危害我们的生命财产，阻挠我们的和平建设。而且要把侵略战争进一步扩大，挑起全世界的战火。现在朝鲜人民正在为保卫他们自己的和平和保卫世界的和平而进行着英勇的战斗，中国人民和全世界和平保卫者一定不能坐视不理的。我们一定要制止战争贩子的侵略阴谋！
    中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席郭沫若在会上报告了中国和大一年来的工作情况，中国和大举反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动委员会合并的经过以及参加世界二届和大的意义与筹备情形，指出中国和平运动的蓬勃发展，是由于毛主席与中国共产党的英明领导，给予人民伟大的爱国主义与国际主义教育的结果。
    自从去年十月二日中华人民共和国诞生的第二天，中国保卫世界和平大会委员会成立以来，中国人民保卫世界和平运动便有组织地迅速展开，尤其是在美帝发动侵略朝鲜台湾以后，中国人民的保卫世界和平运动就更加紧密地与反对侵略运动结合起来。今年五月开始发动的和平签名运动，到今天已经有两万万以上的人民响应这一号召。同时反对美帝侵略、支援朝鲜人民的运动正在全国各地澎湃展开，领导中国人民进行保卫世界和平与反对美帝侵略的两大组织已合并成为一个强大的大本营，这表示中国人民不仅认识了保卫和平与反对侵略的不可分，而且看清了保卫世界和平斗争的新方向——要保卫世界和平，首先要反对美帝侵略。
    一年来我们和平建设的成就，二亿以上的人民在和平宣言上的签名，都证明了中国人民爱好和平的愿望，而我们反对美帝国主义的斗争历史，以及今天全国发出反对美帝国主义侵略的怒吼，则表示出中国人民不怕战争的坚决意志和强大力量。在欢送代表团的大会上，工人、妇女、青年学生和各阶层人民的代表，一致表示全国各阶层的人民目前不仅正在自己的岗位上加紧工作，以实际行动来增强国家的力量，而且随时准备接受毛主席指示的任务，迎击侵略的敌人。
    由几十位优秀的中国人民代表组成的和平代表团，在奔赴和平前线的前夕，接受了四万七千五百万同胞的委托：要把我们坚决为保卫世界和平而奋斗的决心和强大的力量告诉我们的战友，同时也告诉我们的敌人。我们要指出当前美国帝国主义侵略朝鲜、台湾的事实，我们要提出保卫和平的具体建议，我们要提名麦克阿瑟、马修斯、艾奇逊之流为战争贩子，而且要在这一次和平的大会师中，使我们与全世界爱好和平人民的团结百倍的加强，为粉碎帝国主义战争贩子发动侵略战争破坏世界和平的阴谋与行动而斗争。
    “伦敦的迷雾是笼罩不了普照大地的太阳光线的”，世界和大执行局已决定如期在设菲尔德举行二届和大，七十三个国家人民的代表正在纷纷报到。我们的代表团已带着四万七千五百万人民的庄严委托首途赴会。在车站握别的时候，我们的送行者一再叮嘱他们必须努力完成扩大加强世界和平力量团结的神圣任务。郭沫若团长也庄严地表示，一定不辜负全国人民的委托和期望。我们相信：他们必将胜利归来，这不仅因为他们有全国人民的强力支持，而且他们的活动将获得全世界忆万和平保卫者的热烈拥护。
