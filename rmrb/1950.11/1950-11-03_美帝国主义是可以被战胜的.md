　　American Imperialism Can Be Defeated
    Fu Ying
    I
    Imperialist bandits, in order to conquer the world, often carry out propaganda, exaggerating how powerful and irresistible their military force is, attempting to "gain the upper hand by intimidation," scaring those with nervous dispositions, causing them to lose their will to fight, thereby achieving the goal of "winning without a fight," or at least obtaining a cheap victory. This is the main function of imperialism's "psychological warfare."
    In the early stages of World War II, Hitler's Germany systematically cultivated the myth around the world that "Nazi armies could not be defeated." Especially after German mechanized troops annihilated Poland in less than a month, and France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway in less than three months, this myth became popular for a time. However, the Battle of Stalingrad shattered this myth. The heroic Soviet Red Army, under the leadership of the great Comrade Stalin, was not only able to drive the Nazi army out of Soviet territory and liberate Eastern and Central European countries from the clutches of the Nazis, but also entered Germany itself, annihilated the Nazi army, and forced Hitler's Germany to surrender unconditionally. The myth of the "invincible Nazi army" became a historical joke.
    After the end of World War II, American imperialists inherited Hitler's mantle, attempting to fulfill Hitler's unfulfilled dream of conquering the world. American imperialist bandits also systematically spread the myth that "American power cannot be defeated." The effects of the two atomic bombs dropped by American imperialists in Japan were clearly only the mass slaughter of non-combatant peaceful residents, and did not weaken the Japanese imperialists' combat capabilities; but the "psychological warfare" apparatus of American imperialism exaggerated the atomic bomb as a factor determining the outcome of the war, even boasting that accumulating a certain number of atomic bombs would be enough to conquer the globe. When the secret of the atomic bomb was no longer exclusive to the United States, it turned to exaggerating other new weapons, exaggerating the American air force and navy, and exaggerating America's production capacity and economic power. The purpose was nothing more than to scare those with nervous dispositions, so as to achieve "victory without a fight."
    However, this "psychological warfare" conducted by American imperialist bandits has not achieved the expected results. The myth of "American power cannot be defeated" has been shattered by ruthless objective facts and will continue to be shattered. The fate of American imperialism will not be better than that of Hitler's Germany.
    II
    Chairman Mao told us in his book "On New Democracy": "The present world is in a new era of revolution and war, an era in which capitalism is inevitably dying and socialism is inevitably prospering."
    Lenin also told us long ago in his book "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism" that imperialism is "moribund capitalism." When capitalism reaches the stage of imperialism, "it is bound to decay; it may remain in a state of decay for a relatively long period, but it will eventually be eliminated."
    The twentieth century is an era of decaying capitalism, an era in which capitalism is heading towards its demise.
    After World War I, one imperialist country—Tsarist Russia—collapsed, and the first socialist country—the Soviet Union—appeared. After World War II, three more imperialist countries—Germany, Italy, and Japan—were defeated, and two imperialist countries—Britain and France—were weakened, and many new democratic countries appeared—China, Korea, Vietnam, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Albania, and East Germany. From the perspective of the entire world capitalist system, it is on a downward path, deteriorating year by year. The forces of world revolution are growing day by day, like the rising sun.
    The United States also entered a period of decline after World War I. The economic crisis that erupted in 1929 not only reduced its industrial production by half and increased the number of unemployed to 15 million, but even in periods when the economic crisis did not erupt, it could not fully utilize its production capacity, often only utilizing three-quarters of it. The number of unemployed even in the most prosperous period before the eruption of the economic crisis in 1929 was 1.5 million. American capitalism not only has no way to avoid economic crises, but economic crises have become chronic. American monopoly capitalists use war as a morphine injection, attempting to delay the economic crisis and prolong the remaining life of capitalism. Therefore, the temporary economic prosperity brought about by World War II is not proof of the strength of the American economic system, but proof of its weakness. The economic crisis from 1949 to the spring of 1950 was stopped by American monopoly capitalists by launching a war of aggression, which only proves that American capitalism is also so old that it can only maintain its existence by continuing to inject morphine (war).
    The world capitalist system is dying, and among the dying capitalist systems, the United States is considered the most powerful. However, the United States is doomed to fail in its attempt to fight against the entire world revolutionary forces. The wheels of history are moving forward. The era of capitalism is gone forever, and today is the era of socialism.
    III
    Chairman Mao said: "Imperialism is outwardly strong but inwardly weak because it does not have the support of the people." This is the fatal weakness of American imperialism.
    American imperialism's war policy is resolutely opposed by the American people. The United States had already begun preparing for war after the end of World War II. This can be seen from the U.S. government's military budget:
    Fiscal Year 1939    1.37 (billion US dollars)
    Fiscal Year 1948  10.65
    Fiscal Year 1951  13.55
    That is to say, two years after the end of the war, the direct military expenditure in fiscal year 1948 was eight times the direct military expenditure in fiscal year 1939 before the war, and it increased to ten times in fiscal year 1951 (the budget before launching the war of aggression against Korea). It can be seen that American imperialism has long been actively preparing for war.
    Let's take a look at the number of American armed forces. Five years after the end of the war, before launching the war of aggression against Korea, the number of American regular armed forces was still around 1.5 million. This number is much larger compared to the number of naval and ground forces in 1939 before the war:
    1939        367,000 people
    1950      1,451,000 people
    That is to say, after World War II, the strength of the American armed forces was four times that before the war. This also shows that American imperialism is actively preparing for war.
    Who benefits from actively preparing for war? It benefits capitalists—especially monopoly capitalists; because expanding armaments means a large increase in government military orders, and the sales of heavy industries related to arms production will have no problems, monopoly capitalists can make a fortune, and economic crises can be delayed. Who is harmed? The people are harmed; because expanding armaments means an increased tax burden, and an increase in the fiscal deficit, increasing currency issuance, causing inflation, rising prices, decreasing real wages, and worsening living conditions.
    Who benefits when war breaks out? It benefits capitalists—especially monopoly capitalists; because when war breaks out, they can make a fortune from the war. The total profit of American companies in the five years before World War II was 15.3 billion US dollars, and the total profit in the five years during the war was 42.3 billion US dollars, about three times as much. Who is harmed? The people are harmed; because they not only have to bear a heavier tax burden and suffer the losses of inflation, but also have to pay with their lives and be conscripted into the army as cannon fodder.
    The awakened American people do not support the war policy of American imperialists, because the imperialist war policy contradicts the interests of the people.
    IV
    War is the continuation of politics. American imperialism launches wars in order to enslave the people of the world and establish world hegemony. This kind of war is an aggressive and unjust war.
    The American people oppose this aggressive and unjust war. After the war of aggression against Korea was launched, although there was the lure of money (increased army salaries) and the seduction of sex (New York City used beautiful nightclub girls to give kisses to mobilize young people to enlist), very few people volunteered. The American government then implemented compulsory conscription, but about one-fifth of those notified to enlist did not report to the conscription station. As for those who have been deceived or forced to enlist, they are not willing to risk their lives for the benefit of monopoly capitalists. Therefore, the fighting will of the American invading army is very weak. This is the biggest headache for American imperialists.
    Because American imperialists recognize the weakness of human factors, they try to fully exploit the strengths of material factors. This is how the strategic thinking of American imperialists is determined. "Extremely powerful air force, powerful navy, and effective army" are manifestations of this strategic thinking. The plan to conquer the world by dropping atomic bombs is also a manifestation of this strategic thinking. Exaggerating the effectiveness of new defensive weapons and the theory of "winning with small ground defense weapons" are also manifestations of this strategic thinking.
    Due to the nature of the social system (the class exploitation system) and the nature of the war (the unjust war of aggression), the strategic thinking of American imperialism cannot fully exploit the strength of human factors, and can only rely on the strength of material factors. However, war is fought by people using weapons. An army with superior weapons but without a strong fighting spirit is often defeated by an army with a strong fighting spirit but with inferior weapons. National liberation wars and all just wars are victories achieved by exploiting the strength of human factors.
    The new weapons and super weapons that American imperialism exaggerates are not something that the United States can monopolize for a long time. The secret of the atomic bomb is no longer a secret. As for other weapons, such as improved anti-tank guns, recoilless guns, rocket launchers, landmines, etc., they are not only manufactured by American imperialism. Relying solely on new weapons and super weapons to scare people can only deceive oneself. If American imperialism dares to risk the world's disapproval and use atomic bombs first, then the United States will be even more unable to withstand other countries bombing it with atomic bombs, because 65 percent of American industry is concentrated in 9 percent of the country's area. As for strategic bombing by a powerful air force, World War II has proven that it cannot play a decisive role. The failure of Nazi Germany was not due to American strategic bombing, but to the heroic Red Army annihilating large numbers of Hitler's bandit troops.
    In short, the strategic thinking of American imperialism is wrong and is doomed to fail.
    V
    After launching the war of aggression against Korea, American imperialism, in order to accelerate preparations for a world war, used all means to force Western European vassal states to increase their ground forces. This means that American imperialism wants Western European vassal states not to develop air forces or navies, but only to expand their armies, and to use the people of Western Europe as cannon fodder. The so-called "collective forces" mean that the United States provides strategic air force and navy, Britain provides tactical air force and navy, and Western European mainland countries provide army.
    The tragic scenes of World War II are still fresh in the minds of the people of Western European countries. They oppose wars of aggression and even more resolutely oppose the role of cannon fodder arranged for them by American imperialism. This opposition has to be considered even by the reactionary ruling classes of Western European countries. For example, the French government, forced by American imperialism to expand its army, told the United States that, okay, France will expand 15 divisions, but the money must be paid by the United States, and the United States must also send five divisions of ground troops to Europe. This means that France is unwilling to be cannon fodder alone and wants the United States to "die together."
    Speaking of expanding armies, the Western European vassal states also face an insurmountable difficulty. The level of awareness of the working people in Western Europe has greatly increased after World War II, and the influence of the Communist Parties in various countries among the working people has also greatly increased. Especially in France and Italy, the Communist Parties are particularly powerful. The French Communist Party is the largest party in France, and more than one-third of the French people vote for the Communist Party. Therefore, if French people are forced to join the army and armed with American foreign military aid, one-third of the soldiers will be supporters of the Communist Party. This not only gives the French reactionary ruling class a headache, but also makes American imperialists unable to trust such an army. Who can guarantee that such an army will not turn its guns against American imperialists in World War III?
    In order to step up preparations for World War III, American imperialism is forcing Western European vassal states to transform the industry that produces consumer goods and export goods into the production of military weapons, replacing butter with cannons. The living standards of the people in Western European countries are still far below pre-war levels, and the transformation of industry into military production will make people's lives even worse. The burden of military expenditure will also make people's lives more difficult. American imperialism is forcing the people of Western Europe to make such significant sacrifices for American monopoly capitalists to establish world hegemony, which the people of Western Europe are definitely not willing to do. In addition, with the painful experience of war, who wants their hometown to be a battlefield? Who wants their sons and husbands to be cannon fodder? All of this makes the peace-loving and democratic people of Western Europe oppose the ruling groups of American imperialism who are trying to provoke World War III, and oppose the ruling groups of their own countries who have become vassals of the United States. The people of Western Europe will never support the aggressive war of American imperialism!
    This has also been proven by the Korean War. Although American imperialism used all means of oppression to force the vassal states to send troops to participate in the war of aggression against Korea, only a few countries agreed to send ground troops, with a total of only about 30,000 people. The lack of enthusiasm of the vassal states of the United States for the American imperialist war of aggression against Korea proves, on the one hand, that there are contradictions within the imperialist camp, and on the other hand, that the governments of these vassal states have had to hesitate because their people resolutely oppose the war of aggression.
    American imperialism also wants to use the manpower and material resources of West Germany and Japan to carry out war. The rearmament of West Germany and Japan will first be opposed by the people of those countries that suffered at the hands of the German and Japanese armies in World War II, and will also be opposed by the people of Germany and Japan. As a result, American imperialism is even more isolated!
    VI
    The aggressive war power of American imperialism can be defeated and will inevitably be defeated. If American imperialism is now crazy enough to launch a new world war, then its three fatal weaknesses will be fully exposed.
    First, there is too little manpower. The manpower of the imperialist camp headed by American imperialism is much less than the manpower of the democratic and peace camp headed by the Soviet Union. Moreover, due to the class antagonism within the imperialist countries, the antagonism between American imperialism and other imperialist countries, and the antagonism between imperialism and the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries, the power of the imperialist camp is extremely fragile.
    Second, the battle line is too long. It is difficult to attack or defend such a long battle line from the Baltic Sea to the Sea of Japan with the limited forces of the American armed forces plus the armed forces of the big and small lackey countries. The imperialist camp is bound to suffer defeat.
    Third, the supply line is too long. The transportation line from the United States to Europe and Asia is too long. The Atlantic Ocean is more than 3,000 nautical miles, and the Pacific Ocean is more than 5,000 nautical miles. To conduct a large-scale war, the supply of materials will be extremely difficult.
    Although the United States has a large industrial production, this temporary advantage cannot make up for the three shortcomings mentioned above. If the American imperialist warmongers dare to launch a world war now, the powerful world democratic and peace camp has full power to defeat it.

　　美帝国主义是可以被战胜的
    福英
    一
    帝国主义强盗为着征服世界，常进行一种宣传，夸张自己的武力如何强大，如何不可抗拒，企图以“先声夺人”，吓唬神经衰弱者，使他们丧失战斗意志，从而达到“不战而胜”的目的，至少是取得廉价的胜利。这就是帝国主义的“心理战争”的主要作用。
    在第二次世界大战的前期，希特勒德国曾经有计划地在全世界培植着“纳粹军队不可能被战胜”的神话，尤其是在德国机械化军队不到一个月就灭亡了波兰，不到三个月就灭亡了法国、比利时、荷兰、丹麦、挪威等国以后，这种神话更流行一时。可是，斯大林格勒一战，这种神话被粉碎了。英勇的苏联红军，在伟大的斯大林同志领导之下，不仅能够把纳粹军队赶出苏联国土，能够把东欧中欧诸国从纳粹魔手中解放出来，而且打进了德国本土，消灭了纳粹军队，迫使希特勒德国不得不无条件投降。“不可战胜的纳粹军队”这种神话就变成历史的笑话。
    美帝国主义者在第二次世界大战结束之后，继承了希特勒的衣钵，企图完成希特勒所不能完成的征服全世界之梦想。美帝国主义强盗也有计划地在传播着“美国力量不可能被战胜”的神话。美帝国主义者在日本丢了两枚原子弹，其效果明明只是大批屠杀非战斗员的和平居民，并没有削弱日本帝国主义的作战能力；但美帝国主义的“心理战争”的机构，却把原子弹渲染成为战争的决定胜负的因素，甚至于夸口说只要积累有若干枚原子弹使可以征服全球。及至原子弹的秘密已不复是美国所独有时，乃转而夸大宣传其他新式武器，夸大美国的空军和海军，夸大美国的生产能力和经济力量。其目的，无非是吓唬神经衰弱者，以达“不战而胜”。
    可是，美帝国主义强盗所进行的这种“心理战争”并没有获得预期的效果。“美国力量不可能被战胜”的神话，曾经被无情的客观事实所粉碎，也将继续被粉碎。美帝国主义的命运，不会比希特勒德国的命运好些。
    二
    毛主席在《新民主主义论》一书中，告诉我们说：“现在的世界，是处在革命与战争的新时代，是资本主义决然死灭与社会主义决然兴盛的时代。”
    列宁在《帝国主义——资本主义的最高阶段》一书中，也早已告诉了我们说，帝国主义是“垂死的资本主义”，资本主义到了帝国主义阶段，“那它就必然要腐化起来；它也许能在腐化状态中存留一个比较长久的期间，但它终究还是必然会被消除掉的”。
    二十世纪是腐化了的资本主义垂死的时代，是资本主义走向死灭的时代。
    在第一次世界大战之后，一个帝国主义国家——沙皇的俄国——垮台了，出现了第一个社会主义国家——苏联。在第二次世界大战之后，又有三个帝国主义国家——德、意、日——被打败，有两个帝国主义国家——英、法——被削弱，出现了许多新民主主义国家——中国、朝鲜、越南、波、捷、罗、保、匈、阿、德。从世界资本主义体系整个来说，是走着下坡路，一年不如一年。世界革命的力量却日益增长，有如朝日方升。
    美国在第一次世界大战之后，也已进入衰老时期。一九二九年经济大恐慌爆发，固然使其工业生产减少了一半，失业人数增到一千五百万人；就是在经济恐慌没有爆发的时期，也已不能充分利用其生产能力，经常只能利用其四分之三，失业人数在一九二九年经济大恐慌爆发前夕最繁荣时也有一百五十万人。美国资本主义不仅没有办法避免经济恐慌，而且经济恐慌变成慢性的。美国独占资本家以战争当吗啡针打，企图借此推迟经济恐慌，延长资本主义的残命。所以，第二次世界大战所招致的一时的经济繁荣，不是证明美国经济制度的强健，而是证明它的衰弱。一九四九年至一九五○年春季的经济恐慌，美国独占资本家用发动侵略战争来将它阻止了，这也只是证明了美国资本主义也衰老到要靠继续打吗啡针（战争）才能维持其存在。
    世界资本主义体系是垂死的，而在垂死的资本主义体系中，美国算是最强大的一个。然而美国要与整个世界革命力量为敌，是注定失败的。历史车轮是向前进的。资本主义的时代已一去不复返了，今天已是社会主义的时代。
    三
    毛主席说：“帝国主义是外强中干的，因为它没有人民的支持。”美帝国主义的致命弱点，就在于此。
    美帝国主义者的战争政策，是受到美国人民坚决反对的。在第二次世界大战结束后，美国已开始准备战争。从美国政府军事预算就可看出：
    一九三九年度    一三·七（亿美元）
    一九四八年度  一○六·五
    一九五一年度  一三五·五
    这就是说，在战争已结束二年之后，一九四八年度直接军事用费等于战前一九三九年度直接军事用费之八倍，至一九五一年度（发动侵略朝鲜战争以前的预算）增为十倍。可见，美帝国主义早已积极备战。
    再看一看美国武装部队的人数罢。战争结束已经五年，在发动侵略朝鲜战争以前，美国正规武装部队人数尚有一百五十万人左右。这个数目如果与战前一九三九年的海陆军人数相比，大了很多：
    一九三九年        三六七、○○○人
    一九五○年      一、四五一、○○○人
    这就是说，第二次世界大战后，美国武装部队的力量，等于战前之四倍。由此也可以看出美帝国主义是在积极备战。
    积极备战对谁有好处？对资本家——尤其是独占资本家有好处；因为扩张军备意味着政府的军火定货单大量增加，凡与军火生产有关系的重工业，其生产品的销路可无问题，独占资本家可以发财，经济恐慌可以推迟。对谁有害处？对老百姓有害处；因为扩张军备意味着租税负担加重，而且，财政赤字增加，增发通货，引起通货膨胀，物价高涨，实际工资降低，生活因是更加恶化。
    爆发了战争，对谁有好处？对资本家——尤其是独占资本家有好处；因为战争爆发，就可以大发战争财。美国公司利润在第二次世界大战前五年间共为一五三亿元，在战争期间五年中共为四二三亿元，约为三倍。对谁有害处？对老百姓有害处；因为不仅要负担更重的租税，要蒙受通货膨胀的损失，还要付出生命，被征入伍当炮灰。
    觉悟的美国老百姓不支持美帝国主义者的战争政策，因为帝国主义的战争政策是与老百姓的利益相矛盾的。
    四
    战争是政治的继续。美帝国主义为要奴役全世界人民，为要建立世界霸权而发动战争，这种战争是侵略的，非正义的战争。
    美国人民反对这种侵略的、非正义的战争。在侵略朝鲜战争发动之后，虽然有金钱的吸引（提高军队薪饷），有色情的诱惑（纽约市以夜总会美丽女郎送吻来动员青年入队），自愿入伍者仍寥寥无几。美国政府乃实行强制征召，但被通知入伍者，约有五分之一不往征兵站报到。至于已经被骗或被迫入伍的，也并不甘心情愿为独占资本家的利益去拼命。因此，美国的侵略军队的战斗意志是很薄弱的。这是美帝国主义者最头痛的问题。
    美帝国主义者因为认识了人的因素的弱点，所以想法充分发挥物的因素的长处。美帝国主义者的战略思想，就是这样被决定的。“极强大的空军、强大的海军、有效的陆军”是这种战略思想的表现。打算靠丢原子弹来征服世界，也是这种战略思想的表现。夸大新式防御武器的效力，“以小型地面防御武器取胜”的理论，也就是这种战略思想的表现。
    由于社会制度性质（阶级剥削制度），由于战争性质（非正义的侵略战争），使得美帝国主义的战略思想，不可能充分发挥人的因素的力量，而只能依靠物的因素的力量。可是，战争是人使用着武器打的。有优越的武器而没有坚强的斗志的军队，常被有坚强的斗志而武器较差的军队所打败。民族解放战争以及一切正义的战争，就是发挥人的因素的力量而取得胜利的。
    美帝国主义所夸大宣传的新式武器，超级武器，是美国所不能长期垄断的。原子弹的秘密，早已不是秘密。至于其他的武器如像改良的反坦克炮，无后坐力的枪、火箭炮、地雷等等，也不是只有美帝国主义能够制造。要单靠新式武器、超级武器来吓唬人，其实只能欺骗自己。如果美帝国主义敢冒天下之大不韪首先使用原子弹，则美国将更经不起他国同样以原子弹来轰炸它，因为美国工业的百分之六十五密集在全国面积百分之九的地方。至于强大空军战略轰炸，第二次世界大战已证明其不能起决定的作用。纳粹德国的失败，不是归因于美国的战略轰炸，而是归功于英勇的红军大量消灭希特勒匪军。
    总而言之，美帝国主义的战略思想是错误的，是注定失败的。
    五
    在发动了侵略朝鲜战争之后，美帝国主义为着加速准备世界大战，用尽一切手段压迫西欧诸附庸国家增加它们的地面部队。这即是说，美帝国主义要西欧诸附庸国不要发展空军，不要发展海军，而只扩大陆军，要以西欧的人民来当炮灰。所谓“集体部队”，就是美国出战略空军加海军，英国出战术空军加海军，西欧大陆国家出陆军。
    第二次世界大战的惨象，西欧各国人民的记忆犹新，他们反对侵略战争，更坚决反对美帝国主义给他们安排好的充当炮灰的角色。这种反对的情绪，使得西欧各国的反动统治阶级也不得不加以考虑。例如法国政府，被美帝国主义压迫而不得不扩大陆军，就对美国说，好吧，法国扩大十五个师，可是钱要美国掏出来，而且美国也要派五师陆军驻欧。这即是说，法国不愿单独当炮灰，要美国也来“共死”。
    讲到扩张军队，西欧各附庸国还碰到一个无法克服的困难。西欧劳动人民在第二次世界大战以后，觉悟程度大大提高，而各国共产党在劳动人民间的影响也大大增加。尤其在法国和意大利，共产党的力量特别强大。法国共产党是法国第一大党，法国人民投共产党的票的，占三分之一以上。所以，法国老百姓被迫参加军队，由美国的对外军事援助武装起来，其中会有三分之一的士兵是拥护共产党的。这不仅使法国反动统治阶级头痛，也使美帝国主义者对这样的军队不能放心。这样的军队，谁能保证在第三次世界大战中不会掉转枪口对着美帝国主义者呢？
    美帝国主义为着加紧准备第三次世界大战，强迫西欧诸附庸国家把生产消费品及出口品的工业转变为生产军火，以大炮代替牛油。西欧诸国的人民生活标准，现在尚远低于战前，工业转变为军火生产，将使人民生活更形恶化。军费负担，也将使人民生活更苦。美帝国主义强迫西欧人民为了美国独占资本家建立世界霸权而作如此重大的牺牲，决不是西欧人民所甘愿的。再加上战争惨痛的经验，谁愿自己的家乡作战场？谁愿自己的儿子丈夫当炮灰？这一切，使得爱好和平、民主的西欧人民，反对企图挑起第三次世界大战的美帝国主义的统治集团，反对成为美国附庸的本国统治集团。西欧人民是决不支持美帝国主义的侵略战争的！
    这从朝鲜战争也得到了证明。虽然美帝国主义用尽一切压迫手段，压使诸附庸国家出兵参加侵略朝鲜战争，结果只有寥寥几个国家答应出陆军，总数不过三万人左右。美国的诸附庸国家对于美帝侵略朝鲜战争如此不热心，一方面证明了帝国主义阵营间存在着矛盾，一方面证明这些附庸国家的政府，因它们的人民坚决反对侵略战争，而不得不有所踌躇。
    美帝国主义又想利用西德和日本的人力物力来进行战争。重新武装西德和日本，首先将受到那些在第二次世界大战中曾经遭受德日军队蹂躏的国家的人民反对，其次也将受到德日人民反对。结果，美帝国主义是更加孤立了！
    六
    美帝国主义的侵略战争力量，是可以被打败而且必然将被打败的。如果现在美帝国主义疯狂到发动新的世界大战的话，那末，它的三个致命弱点就将充分暴露出来了。
    第一，人力太少。以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义阵营的人力，是比较以苏联为首的民主和平阵营的人力少得多。而且，由于帝国主义国内的阶级对立，由于美帝国主义与其他帝国主义间的对立，由于帝国主义与殖民地，半殖民地人民间的对立，使得帝国主义阵营的力量是极其脆弱的。
    第二，战线太长。从波罗的海到日本海这么长的一条战线，以现在美国的武装部队再加上大小喽罗国家的武装部队的有限力量，进攻或防守都很困难。帝国主义阵营吃败仗是一定的。
    第三，供给交通线太长。美国到欧洲和到亚洲的交通线太长。大西洋三千多海里，太平洋五千多海里。要进行大规模的战争，物资供给将发生极大的困难。
    虽然美国有颇大的工业生产，但这一暂时的长处并不能弥补上面所说的三个短处。如果美帝国主义战争贩子现在敢于发动世界战争，强大的世界民主和平阵营是有充分力量把它打垮的。
