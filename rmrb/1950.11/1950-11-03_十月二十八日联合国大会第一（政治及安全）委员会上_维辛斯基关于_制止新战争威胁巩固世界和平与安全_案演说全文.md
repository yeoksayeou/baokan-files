The First (Political and Security) Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on October 28, 1950, Vyshinsky delivered a speech on the "Stopping the Threat of New Wars and Strengthening World Peace and Security" proposal. The full text is as follows:

Some members of our committee tried to avoid discussing the "Stopping the Threat of New Wars and Strengthening World Peace and Security" proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation. However, this attempt completely failed. Not only that, but the initiative taken by the Soviet delegation on this issue has forced some delegations to follow this path and put forward their own proposals on this issue. The sponsor of the Bolivian proposal had to admit that he did so, just like the sponsors of the Six-Power proposal, out of fear of world public opinion; they feared that opposing the Soviet proposal would provoke the indignation of all righteous people and all nations that condemn war-mongers and love peace.

The Soviet proposal aligns with the wishes of all righteous people and puts the Anglo-American bloc in a very awkward position. The Bolivian representative openly declared: strictly speaking, the Soviet proposal should be completely rejected; but he added: if we just reject this proposal, we might—using his words—fall into the trap of Soviet propaganda, and the Soviet proposal—this he admitted—contains some good points, so it is even more impossible to reject it. The New Zealand representative, although he openly attacked our proposal, had to admit that it is very attractive and could become a "bait." The Dutch representative also talked about this issue, believing that the main task of the First Committee is to eliminate the impression that only the Soviet Union loves peace.

From this, it is clear that the proposals from the Bolivian delegation, the Six-Power proposal, and the proposal just put forward by the Greek delegation all appeared because the Anglo-American bloc found themselves in a very awkward position. Lawyers call this situation an extreme necessity, forcing one to take actions contrary to one's wishes.

I will not discuss the three proposals for now, as we will have the opportunity to do so later. I want to directly address those who have criticized our various suggestions and our draft declaration.

First, it should be said that the distinctive feature of what can be considered the most significant speeches is their attempt, at any cost—even by distorting and fabricating facts—to defame the suggestions of the Soviet delegation and, along with them, the entire foreign policy of the Soviet Union. In this regard, the American representative was particularly enthusiastic. Austin, in his speech on October 26, said: the Soviet Union this year proposed these suggestions under conditions of armed aggression, and according to him, it is precisely the sponsor of this proposal who supports and encourages this armed aggression.

This is completely irresponsible and provocative talk. This forces me to recall the development of the situation in Korea and to recount the many pieces of evidence presented by the Soviet delegation in the First Committee and the General Assembly during the discussion on the Korean situation, which prove American aggression in Korea. These pieces of evidence have never been refuted. It was at that time that Mr. Austin and his friends could have presented some documents, cited some facts, and provided some evidence to prove the "North Korean aggression" claim.

However, when this issue was discussed in the meeting and discussed for quite a long time, such things were not presented at all, because the American representative at that time and now has not a single fact or a single piece of evidence to present to refute the evidence of American aggression in Korea.

The Anglo-American bloc refused to hear the views of the North Korean representative here and in the General Assembly or the Security Council, which is a fact. Hearing the views of the North Korean representative would have been fair and reasonable and necessary for an objective approach to this issue.

Since the current issue involves Korea, we should point out that the organizers of the Korean slaughter, after launching their military adventure in Korea, not only brutally violated international obligations and international law but also used Japanese troops to fight against the Korean people. This is something we have repeatedly mentioned and provided evidence for.

The Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Pak Hon-yong, issued a statement on October 14, which has been distributed to the member states of the United Nations. The statement presents evidence proving that Japanese troops are fighting alongside American troops in Korea, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has just cause to protest against this. We fully support this protest because such actions are a blatant violation by the United States of international agreements on the post-war status of Japan and the fundamental principles of the United Nations Organization.

From all these irrefutable facts—I say again, these are irrefutable facts—it can be seen that Austin's words about armed aggression—claiming that this aggression is encouraged by the sponsor of this proposal—are especially false and hypocritical.

With these facts, Austin should no longer conspire to defame the sponsor of the Soviet proposal. However, Austin did not hesitate, did not restrain himself from such tricks, and it is clear that he is trying to obstruct the calm discussion of the important suggestions of the Soviet Union. He even said: the Soviet representative, after returning to the United Nations, has become the representative of the aggressors. In addition, Austin, after mentioning Marshal Stalin's telegram of October 12, made a rude and slanderous attack, which the Soviet delegation indignantly ignored.

Austin could not resist the facts we presented during the discussion of the Korean situation because these facts irrefutably proved that the "North Korean aggression" claim is completely untenable and exposed that the United States is indeed aggressing against the Korean people. Austin attacked—although belatedly, but very fiercely—those who uphold the just cause of the Korean people. He resorted to despicable and dirty sarcasm and slander. However, he should know that, as the saying goes, slander is of no avail and will be exposed in a few days.

Before directly discussing the situation of the discussion of our draft declaration, I would like to talk about the issue of propaganda for a new war.

The Soviet delegation proposed its draft declaration, advocating what? It advocates declaring that the General Assembly condemns the propaganda for a new war being carried out in some countries and demands that all countries prohibit such propaganda within their borders and punish those who carry out such propaganda.

Some people say: such a resolution has already been passed in 1947. This is incorrect. Such a resolution has not been passed. On this issue, a resolution was passed, but this resolution is insufficient, although this resolution, if effectively implemented—this is my hope—would have been beneficial at that time and now. Unfortunately, it has not been able to be implemented. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen this resolution and to remind the member states of the United Nations again: their participation in such an organization pursuing a lofty purpose—the purpose of establishing friendly and neighborly peaceful relations among nations and states, opposing any attempt to incite a new war, disrupt peace, and obstruct friendly relations among countries—is incompatible with the actions of the news agencies and individuals in their countries—here they are called irresponsible, idle talkers—and even more incompatible with the actions of the high-ranking representatives, famous political figures, and leaders in these countries. These people, without hesitation, openly declare in their crazy propaganda for a new war that it is necessary to fight against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

In fact, in such a situation, the Soviet government believes that its duty is not only to be satisfied with the resolution passed three years ago on the same issue but also to propose to declare the condemnation of war propaganda again, to declare the determination to carry out an effective and active struggle against war instigators and war-mongers, and to carry out this struggle with more decisive methods than those passed by the General Assembly in 1947.

It is for this reason that our current draft includes new provisions to pursue those who commit this evil propaganda.

This is a necessary and important supplement to the 1947 resolution passed on November 3. It is necessary because the war-mongers do not stop, because the United Nations Organization must take more decisive measures to deal with these gentlemen in order to curb the blatant and open danger of these enemies of peace, whose activities constitute a clear and present danger on a global scale. This is how we see this issue.

Austin took a non-serious attitude towards this important issue and began to look for excuses to obstruct the passage of this noble proposal. However, as expected, he did not find a suitable excuse; therefore, he had to claim that the Soviet Union violated the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on November 3, 1947, and claim that after the United Nations General Assembly passed the aforementioned resolution, the Soviet Union began a period of official incitement of hostility towards the outside world, unprecedented in modern history, but he could not provide any evidence.

Coincidentally, the British representative, Young, also made a similar statement with exactly the same words.

Obviously, Young and Austin used the same source and the same fabricated materials.

This "period of hostility towards the outside world," unprecedented in history, turned out to be (gentlemen, what do you think?) criticism of the flattery and servile worship of Western culture in front of capitalism—criticism that was carried out in the Soviet Union at that time and is still being carried out now!

Here, we can first ask: where is there any international rule or principle that prohibits criticism of Western culture's famous Spengler (who calls this culture "the decline of the West"), and why do we not have the right to criticize the tendencies cultivated in the United States, such as literature, drama, and film? In the United States, the main and popular protagonists in the works of this culture are bandits, murderers, and thugs. They poison the minds of the younger generation with their malicious influence, causing such a dangerous percentage of criminal cases in the total number of criminal cases. I see the American representative looking at me in surprise. He probably heard such things for the first time. Yes, we oppose the flattery and servile worship of Western culture, but we declare that this is our domestic affair and, moreover, it has nothing to do with the issue of war propaganda. Even a three-year-old child should understand this.

At that time, the then Foreign Minister Molotov said in the report on the 30th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, which Acheson mentioned, that the ruling class of old Russia often had a great dependence on countries that were more developed in the capitalist sense in terms of spirit.

Molotov pointed out at that time: due to this situation, it was possible to cultivate a slave mentality among some old intellectuals, believing that our country and our culture are inferior to European bourgeois countries and are spiritually dependent on these countries.

Austin obviously never thought that this was not a matter of hostility towards the outside world, but a matter of cultivating the national dignity of the people and cultivating the people's love for their national culture. This national culture is important for every nation, but every nation—regardless of size—will contribute its culture to the total treasure trove of human culture and civilization. The Russian nation and many other nations of the Soviet Union have already done a lot in this regard. To this treasure trove, they have already contributed a rich portion, which is our world-renowned works in culture, science, art, literature, criticism, drama, and film.

Everyone should understand that flattery and servile worship of other countries will make any nation stagnant and is a fatal danger to the spiritual and cultural development of that nation.

However, Austin probably does not understand this. He calls this propaganda of hostility towards the outside world, as if propaganda for one's own national love and propaganda for the full value of one's own national culture is an expression of hostility towards another nation's culture. However, Austin, on October 26, tried to defend precisely this point. On that day, he believed that propaganda for the love of one's own country's culture and the cultivation of respect for national dignity is an act of hostility against other nations' cultures and national dignity, and he even claimed that this violates the resolution of the General Assembly on November 3, 1947, regarding new war propaganda.

Is there anything more absurd than this reasoning? I can only sincerely feel sorry for Mr. Austin and his secretaries, who may be more responsible for this absurd nonsense than he himself, as they handed him this fabricated material, which obviously has no clear concept of what it is talking about.

Some representatives, especially Young (Britain) and Spender (Australia), during the discussion of our proposal, tried to claim here that the Soviet Union proposes proposals to strengthen international peace and security every year, but at the same time takes completely opposite actions, encouraging war propaganda and allowing propaganda campaigns aimed at deliberately hating the governments of Western countries—according to their words. This is essentially the same as what I just exposed when I revealed Austin's slanderous rumors about the propaganda of hostility towards the outside world. Therefore, there is no need to discuss this issue in detail. However, I must cite facts to generally refute the statements of people like Mr. Young and Mr. Spender.

The fact is that in 1947—the year mentioned in Spender's speech—the Soviet Union proposed a suggestion to condemn new war propaganda, and at that time, in the United States, Britain, and some other countries, there was a frenzied propaganda for such a war. We cited many facts at that time, named the names of war-mongers, and exposed their plans of aggression. No one could deny these facts, but it was precisely these facts, precisely the situation in these countries, that forced the Soviet government to insist in the General Assembly on the need to take decisive measures to stop this evil activity, which actually threatened peace and security.

The facts are so irrefutable, the situation is so intolerable even for the most patient person who can tolerate this evil propaganda for a long time, that the General Assembly had to pass a resolution condemning this propaganda—the resolution of November 3, 1947; the representatives who participated in the First Committee and the Second General Assembly and are now here must still remember, despite Austin's hysterical outcry that the "Soviet proposal must be defeated," the General Assembly had to pass the aforementioned resolution.

Facts have proven that they did not "defeat" this proposal. The resolution of November 3, 1947, was based on the idea contained in this proposal, and this idea still exists. Some delegations now mention it in their proposals. This idea requires that today, under current conditions, it should be confirmed and implemented in a form that conforms to the meaning and essence of this idea. This is what we are proposing.

The situation in 1947 was like this. But we are not concerned with the affairs of 1947; we are concerned with what is happening now, and what is happening now makes us believe that the instigators of a new war have not stopped, the propaganda for a new war has not weakened, but has even intensified, and adopted more acute and therefore more dangerous to the cause of peace new methods. It is for this reason that the United Nations cannot, for example, like Austin, ignore and disregard these events, and cannot remain indifferent to such shameful facts as the trafficking of war, the constant, systematic, and increasingly large-scale dissemination of poisonous seeds of hatred for humanity in a threatening manner.

Gentlemen, one cannot allow, for example, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives Military Committee, Indiana Representative Walsh, and not someone mentioned here as irresponsible, to make such a statement. He shamelessly declared at the Postal Workers Convention in August this year that the United States is approaching the time when atomic bombs will be dropped on the Soviet Union one after another.

Think about what this statement means! Think about the reaction that all righteous people must have to such a statement! If any politician or member of a parliamentary committee from another country said we will drop atomic bombs on your country one after another, what would the United States say? What would you say? You would say that this person is either a fugitive criminal or an escaped lunatic who must be immediately put in a straitjacket and definitely not allowed to serve as a member of the U.S. House Military Committee.

If we—the United Nations Organization—as an organization responsible for maintaining international peace and promoting friendly and neighborly relations among countries, are not to commit suicide, then such facts are intolerable. No matter how different our political views, political systems, social structures, economic structures, etc., are, and no matter how different everything is, every person entering the field of international relations must have a minimum moral condition. This minimum moral condition is incompatible with and cannot be reconciled with the savage views of unrepentant criminals who incite war, no matter how high their position.

We say that people cannot allow the president of Tampa City University (Florida)—note that he is the president—a man named Nance, to make such a statement. This president, this educator of youth, this "enlightener" stated: I believe we must prepare fully according to the law of the jungle. Everyone must learn how to slaughter. Nance said, I will agree to bacteriological warfare, the use of poison gas, atomic bombs, and rockets launched to other continents. I will not ask for mercy towards hospitals, churches, educational institutions, or any civilian groups... Gentlemen, what do you have to say about such a doctor, president, professor who spreads such madness in the name of honest science from the lectern of a university? We must treat such a professor with Walsh and send him to the insane asylum immediately. Let him be the director of the insane asylum. He will be normal among the insane, but he will naturally be a lunatic among the sane.

Here is the third fact. The chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Mr. Cannon of Missouri, also publicly incited an attack on the Soviet Union with atomic bombs. He naturally forgot a simple fact, that there will be bombs to retaliate. The secretary of the American Federation of Labor, Gale, publicly declared at the beginning of this year that in the last war, they united communists to fight against fascism, and in the new war, they will unite fascists to crush communists.

We can congratulate the secretary of the American Federation of Labor on such a future, which confirms what we have said, that the American foreign policy that produces various Nances, various Walshes, and various Gales is to unite fascists, and this unity has already occurred, for example, in West Germany, where the United States and Britain, with the participation of France, are organizing the West German army to crush communists and appointing fascist generals to command these armies.

The entire foreign policy of some countries is essentially like this, and we warn them not to do so. We firmly believe that for the honor and dignity of the United Nations, this organization should loudly condemn the intentions, trends, plans, desires, and such designs that are hostile to humanity.

Spender tried to defame the Soviet Union's foreign policy, which showed his ignorance and his habit of lying. In his speech, he mentioned the 1947 Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, saying: this conference has already shown that the Soviet Union is avoiding the possibility of reaching an agreement with the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France. This is pure fabrication. This fabrication either shows Spender's complete ignorance of the documents of that conference or shows his deeply rooted habit of lying. However, I think this time he has both. So what was the actual situation of the 1947 Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference? I believe, and this can be demonstrated with documents, that at this conference, many important regulations and decisions on the German question were agreed upon. For example, the decision to take various preparatory measures to establish a temporary central government in Germany was passed, and at the same time, the powers of this future German central government were determined in great detail. The division of powers between the temporary central government and the state governments in political unification, economic unification, financial unification, and judicial unification was also agreed upon. It was then acknowledged that the future central government would have the right to implement the following measures: control food supply, allocate scarce food and raw materials, formulate industrial plans, control labor conditions, wages, prices, and other major issues of all-German significance; agreements were also reached on the denazification of Germany, the elimination of militarism, the abolition of military enterprises, and several other issues. All this was passed, all this was decided. Can it be said in such a situation that the conference was fruitless due to the obstruction of the Soviet Foreign Minister? Obviously, this is both ignorant and arrogant.

On the other hand, Spender did not mention the fact that after the 1947 Moscow conference, although agreements were reached on some issues, the governments of the United States and Britain took the path of dividing Germany, abandoning the obligations agreed upon in the Moscow conference, and more importantly, abandoning the obligations based on the Potsdam Agreement.

At that time, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France began to interfere in West Germany, using West Germany to achieve their aggressive purposes.

I believe that the above facts are absolutely sufficient to prove the recklessness of the Australian speaker on the facts. He talked about our policy in 1948 and 1949, when we took various measures to avoid the threat of a new war, but he distorted the facts. In the issues of Czechoslovakia, Austria, the "Berlin Blockade," etc., he stated the facts with extremely hypocritical and malicious views. My friend, the Czechoslovakian representative, Mr. Siroky, has partially talked about this, mentioning some aspects of these issues. I will talk about the other issues.

Spender repeated the stale, fabricated rumors that were refuted at that time. Therefore, it is useless to argue with Spender, especially since he disregarded the basic requirements of debate—that is, the accurate presentation of facts—and it is even more useless to argue with him.

I must also talk about the 1949 Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference held in May-June. The results of this conference fully refuted the proposition put forward by Spender here to the disadvantage of the Soviet Union. Indeed, who does not know that the Paris Foreign Ministers' Conference reached agreements on several important issues regarding Germany and Austria? Despite great difficulties and many divisive contradictions, the four foreign ministers finally found a common platform on the issues of Germany and Austria in May-June 1949. This platform has been indicated in the communiqué—which is not common in recent years. This communiqué contains several important obligations and was unanimously adopted. This communiqué also pointed out the principles of the unanimously adopted decisions—a very serious principle—and briefly described several possible measures. If everyone adhered to this unanimously adopted communiqué, these measures should have been implemented. Unfortunately, due to the unwillingness of the governments of the United States and Britain to solve the Berlin problem, these measures did not become a reality. At that time in Berlin, there was an obviously pre-approved strike by railway workers, which caused serious political and economic damage. The organizers of this strike were none other than the American and British authorities in West Berlin, who also supported the strike with money.

At that time, we proposed to discuss the issue of drafting a peace treaty with Germany. Even earlier, at the 1948 Paris conference, we proposed to solve the German problem. At that time, the representatives of six countries, under the chairmanship of Bruegmann (former Argentine Foreign Minister), took on the role of so-called mediators—some of whom are present today, and they must remember this matter. At that time, a platform was drafted that could be used to solve the Berlin problem. At that time, the six small countries, under the chairmanship of Bruegmann (I clearly remember that among the six representatives, there was the chairman of the Syrian delegation, Mr. El-Ghori), drafted this platform, and we accepted this platform. However, these six countries were then subjected to pressure from the United States and Britain, just as now, in the election and appointment of the United Nations Secretary-General, the United States, in order to illegally extend the term of the former Secretary-General, exerts pressure to obstruct all nominations. Now many people want to be the Secretary-General of the United Nations, many people have been nominated and supported—such as the representatives of Latin American countries and Arab countries—but because they are subjected to pressure from the United States side to obstruct all nominations, they cannot do anything. It was also due to this pressure that at that time the agreement was obstructed.

Therefore, if we are to talk about the German issue, then the Soviet Union had already advanced many steps to the maximum extent in 1948 and 1949 to reach an agreement, when the Soviet Union was very concerned with cooperation with other countries, specifically the so-called small countries, but to no avail. However, in the face of these facts, any decent person can say that the Soviet delegation here, on the one hand, proposes proposals to strengthen peaceful relations and cooperation, and on the other hand, secretly implements the requirements proposed by the Communist International at its Sixth Congress in 1928, twenty-two years ago, by the communist organizations of various countries! Twenty-two years ago, and this is used as an example of the Soviet Union's policy of betrayal!

As for the Austrian treaty, we reached agreements on several issues at that time, but this treaty is still undecided to this day. What is the matter? Spender should know: the decisions reached by the four powers on important issues such as the denazification of Austria and the demilitarization of Austria have not been implemented in Austria to this day.

Until now, the active Hitler subordinates of the past are still in Austria, holding high positions in Austrian government agencies. Various pro-fascist organizations and groups are becoming more active. Now, various measures are being taken to remilitarize in the western part of Austria, which is a fact: the Austrian army is being restored, military airfields, arsenals, and test sites are being built. At the same time, the agreements on the control mechanism of Austria and the decisions of the Allied Commission on Austria in 1946 on the denazification of Austrian government agencies have not been implemented. The decisions of the Allied Commission to prohibit all military activities in Austria have not been implemented, all this is due to the obvious connivance of the American and British military occupation authorities. This is why, when the Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Conference on the Austrian Treaty reconvened in September this year, the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister proposed that the Austrian government must take decisive and effective measures to oppose fascism, which is included in the Austrian Treaty, this fascist force is not only rising day by day but every moment in Austria. This requires: the Austrian Treaty must decide the entire program of its internal and external policy activities, that is, to ensure that the Austrian government has no possibility and cannot allow the restoration of the system produced by Hitler's "Anschluss." This proposal was also rejected and not accepted. Obviously, these activities of the pro-fascist elements in the Austrian power organs are protected in this way, and these activities do not want to pay attention to the great political significance of the Four-Power decisions on Austria. Moreover, another important situation that should be pointed out is: the ruling classes of the United States, Britain, and France, on the one hand, spare no effort to strive for the conclusion of the Austrian Treaty, but on the other hand, do not implement the requirements stipulated in the previously concluded treaty; the provisions on the Free Territory of Trieste in the Italian Treaty have not been implemented to this day. For example, although three years have passed since then, the Security Council has not yet appointed a governor, and this issue is the same as the current Secretary-General issue. For three years, no matter who the Soviet delegation recommended to be the candidate for the governor of the Free Territory of Trieste, they were all obstructed by the majority who followed the orders of the United States.

Even if we recommended someone who was exactly the candidate nominated by the representatives of this group, such as recommending a candidate nominated by Britain, these candidates were also rejected.

However, since there is no appointment of a governor, it is impossible to implement the regulations, and it is impossible to implement the requirements of the Italian Treaty, such as the withdrawal of British and American troops from Trieste, etc.

This is the situation with the Trieste case; this is the "core of the issue."

However, if the treaty on Trieste is not implemented, then what can guarantee the implementation of the Austrian Treaty? If, due to the non-implementation of the Italian Treaty, Trieste is now actually a military base of the United States and Britain, then what can guarantee that Austria will not become a base like the so-called Free Territory of Trieste? There is absolutely no guarantee! Therefore, it is natural that at the September London Four-Power Deputy Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Soviet representative again raised the following question: that is, first of all, it is necessary to implement the treaty on the Free Territory of Trieste, to withdraw the troops from there, thus proving that the treaty is not only signed but also implemented. Otherwise, signing any new treaty is meaningless.

If Spender had the courage to speak here in the manner of a prosecutor accusing the Soviet Union, he should know this fact. He obviously knows it; but in this case, if he knows this but still speaks like this, then this is not ignorance but arrogance.

At the Paris Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, we had already proposed to discuss the issue of the Japanese Peace Treaty, but this was met with what is called in novels "cold silence." This is the fact about these issues, but Spender and many others, including Young and Austin, actually used these issues as an excuse to claim that the Soviet Union has not fulfilled its obligations to Austria and Germany. But who has not fulfilled their obligations? You gentlemen have no right to say such things arbitrarily.

The representatives of the United States, Britain, and some other countries in the Anglo-American bloc have taken a hostile attitude towards, and I might even say, taken up arms to oppose, the part of our declaration that specifically discusses the prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of international control to supervise the implementation of this prohibition.

They opposed our proposals on this issue and carefully evaded the issue of whether to require the United Nations General Assembly to declare the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of strict international control (as stated in the second paragraph of our declaration). They evaded answering this question, that is, the question of whether to require the declaration of the determination to destroy atomic weapons, when they certainly foresaw that the discussion of the plans and other measures related to the implementation of this declaration would necessarily become the subject of study for the Atomic Energy Commission or some other organs of the United Nations.

Austin mentioned the second paragraph of our declaration and only said that the American international control plan, according to his words, can ensure effective enforcement guarantees.

I understand very well that we will still have to discuss this issue, so there is no need to go into detail now. I will only say the main and most important points to determine the current situation of this matter.

What Austin said about effective guarantees, we cannot accept, because we all know very well what the infamous plan invented by Acheson, Baruch, and the Lilianthal Commission in 1945 is. We know what kind of guarantees this plan is plotting. We know the main special provisions of this plan. We know that this plan is to transfer all atomic resources, all atomic material processing enterprises, all related enterprises, and various key industrial sectors—metallurgy, chemistry, and many other industries—to the full control of this so-called international control organization. Indeed, according to this plan, only the so-called "safe" amount of atomic energy and the so-called secondary importance enterprises are controlled by individual atomic energy-producing countries.

However, it should be pointed out that the definition of what is "safe" and what is "dangerous" is precisely determined by the same international control organization.

This international control organization has the right to arbitrarily restrict the amount of atomic energy that a country can use for peaceful purposes, because only after signing the appropriate agreements can atomic energy be used for peaceful purposes.

Therefore, if a country obtains atomic energy, it cannot handle this atomic energy in its own country—even if it is to be used for peaceful purposes and only for peaceful purposes—but only a certain amount is allocated to it, which can be used for its purposes. Obviously, this international control organization has become the all-powerful agency for managing and distributing this designated atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

Every political leader, politician, or economist with a little knowledge can easily guess what this means. It is very easy to guess, which means the complete abolition of the sovereignty of each country to independently handle atomic energy used for peaceful purposes.

I draw everyone's attention to this fact, that: according to this American plan, the atomic energy resources of each country, more or less, are to be used in proportion to the whole world. Therefore, if it is said that the Soviet Union needs one hundred units of atomic energy for peaceful construction, and according to the principle of proportional use for the whole world, the Soviet Union cannot have one hundred units but can only have fifty units, then it can only obtain fifty units, and the other fifty units it has no right to use.

In this way, when it needs atomic energy as the most powerful motive force to develop its industry, it must reduce its industry.

In this way, this is especially important for those countries that lack motive power and atomic energy will play a decisive role in their economic development. At the same time, this is also important for those countries where atomic energy can play a very important role in the development and progress of their economy and industry, because once the amount of atomic energy does not match the proportion determined by this international atomic energy control organization, the amount of atomic energy will be reduced.

This is the meaning of this plan. This means that the international control agency, when exercising this principle, can artificially restrict the development of the national economies of all countries using atomic energy. Everyone knows very well that this will inevitably have a very unfavorable impact on the entire life and welfare of a country.

This fact can indeed lead to such a result, and we can clearly see this from the report of the U.S. Commission on Social and Political Consequences headed by Professor Frank, which was published in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists on May 1, 1946.

This report directly admits: the method of restricting raw materials and uranium mines by such a quota or so-called rationing will have defects, as this report says—I am now quoting from this report—it will hinder the development of atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

If even such an authoritative commission in its official report to the Secretary of War says that such a method of development and rationing will hinder the development of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, then how can those who are concerned with the development of their national economy and sincerely do not want to use atomic energy to make atomic bombs, but want to use it for the benefit of the people and for the benefit of the culture and civilization of the whole world, accept such a situation?

However, what the United States is eager for is precisely this plan, completely disregarding the fact that this plan will doom the peaceful economic development of a country. Even if this plan had no other defects and only this single defect, could we agree to it? Moreover, it has other defects, and these defects are not trivial.

What is the purpose of this so-called American international control plan?

Answering this question is not difficult. This plan serves the task of using atomic energy only for military purposes, and this military purpose has nothing in common with the purposes and tasks of the United Nations Organization, because the purpose of this plan is to realize the world hegemony of American monopoly capital.

The so-called American international control plan is to ensure that American monopoly capital has the greatest influence in the international control organization, in fact, to make this organization a tool of these monopolies, a tool of their policies. However, the sovereignty of sovereign states, the sovereignty that constitutes the pillar of each country's independence, seriously hinders the realization of their policies.

In my opinion, this is why the supporters of the American plan have repeatedly attacked the principle of state sovereignty in previous sessions of the General Assembly and in this session.

They attack this, saying that it is a medieval idea, a remnant of the Middle Ages.

In fact, the principle of sovereignty is the principle that guarantees the political and economic independence of a country.

Someone tells us that this will be an international organization, which will have the corresponding control agencies. But we know what Baruch—the sponsor of this plan—said about this, he said that first of all this organization will be established according to the principle of "qualifications." Does someone have the qualifications to work in this organization, and who will decide this? Still not those who control the majority there?

In addition, when selecting the personnel to participate in this international organization, it will be done "as far as possible" according to the principle of international representation. Only "as far as possible"! Someone, especially the British representative Young, told us in the meeting that deviating from the traditional concept of sovereignty is necessary. He blamed us, claiming that we are against any agreement that does not strictly implement state sovereignty according to traditional concepts. This is not in line with the facts. If people read the detailed records of last year's General Assembly meeting, they will be convinced that the Soviet delegation has made a very clear statement on this issue, that is, any international agreement—this is also a principle of international law—inevitably means certain restrictions on the sovereignty of other countries. However, the question is not about this internationally recognized principle of international law—which is indisputable; the question is to what extent these restrictions can go, to what extent restrictions on sovereignty can go, and what should be the limit of restricting sovereignty? It should be clear that one can argue about various different limits, but for those who truly understand the meaning of sovereignty and acknowledge the existing principles of international law, it is undoubtedly impossible to restrict the sovereignty of a country to the extent that the sovereignty of that country is completely gone, in other words, the restriction of sovereignty would reduce sovereignty to zero.

However, the supporters of the so-called American international atomic energy control plan want to reach precisely this extent. We cannot agree to such a plan.

Our proposal is based on the necessity of unconditionally prohibiting atomic weapons and establishing strict international control to supervise the implementation of this prohibition.

Austin claimed that the American government is willing to consider any plan in this regard, but is not willing to consider empty talk. This is of course correct. Who wants to consider empty talk? However, I must say that Austin dared to say so. If he is referring to the suggestions of the Soviet delegation, then he must go to great lengths to prove that these suggestions are indeed all "empty talk." So far, no one has been able to do this, no one has ever done so; I think no one will be able to do so in the future. No one has done this, and I think no one will be able to do it in the future.

Title: The United States' International Control Plan Does Not Prohibit Atomic Bombs

However, regardless of how we view this matter, the United States' international control plan does not stipulate the prohibition of atomic bombs. This is quite clear. In our current six-nation proposal, this point is also clearly expressed. Let's take a look at the relevant section. Does it contain even a single word that mentions "prohibiting" atomic weapons? Does it contain even a single word that calls for the United Nations General Assembly to "appeal," "demand," "declare," or "suggest"—in short, in any form—to prohibit atomic weapons? It only states that each country must undertake the obligation to establish effective international control to effectively implement the prohibition of atomic weapons. However, to enforce the ban, a formal ban must be issued. Yet, the six-nation proposal does not mention this at all!

So, who can tell me which document binds others from producing atomic weapons? In other words, which document prohibits the production of atomic weapons? If we look back at the many resolutions we have passed here, we can see that these resolutions only emphasize the need to "take various measures in this regard." But look, to take various measures in this regard, we have been working for over three years, yet there is still no method to prohibit the production or use of atomic weapons.

Since there is no such ban, all the problems and suggestions regarding the establishment of international control are essentially empty talk. These are indeed empty talk. What is the background to this issue? Let us recall. The Soviet Union said: To supervise the implementation of the ban, we must first establish a ban on atomic weapons. First, the ban, then the control.

Someone tells us: Prohibition? We are willing, but perhaps you do not agree to establish control, then the ban will become a mere piece of paper. Having a ban without control is meaningless. Someone else tells us: Both must be done simultaneously. We agree with this view. However, just as we are about to express our agreement, our opponents go back on their word. They say, "No, control must be established first." So, let us tell you frankly, we suspect that you do not really want to prohibit atomic weapons, because talking about prohibition alone will not yield results. This is empty talk, a smokescreen. To say "establish effective control to effectively prohibit" while not first saying "prohibit atomic weapons and establish control so that the ban can be enforced" is, of course, to play word games, to propose an ambiguous regulation that can be interpreted without reason at any time. This is especially important when it comes to establishing control over certain things.

If control is to prevent misuse, it is necessary to first specify what constitutes misuse. However, the representatives of the United States and Britain who support the international control plan do not have this in their plan. You cannot find this in their plan.

You can tell me here: What reason do you have for such suspicions? We only think that this is more beneficial for the matter. There is reason for suspicion. Last year, I pointed out these reasons, and this year I must reiterate them.

The United States' entire rhetoric on international control proves that it does not intend to stop the production of atomic weapons.

I recall an important document, which is a letter from the members of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission dated March 17, 1946, signed by Acheson, Bush, Conant, McLoy, and General Groves. The letter clearly states: Even after the establishment of the international control organization, the United States does not intend to stop the production of atomic bombs. The letter says: The formulation of detailed plans for such programs requires further research, enormous technical expertise, and a large number of personnel. Of course, this requires the main policy decisions to be clearly defined. One of these decisions will be the question of how long the United States will continue to produce atomic bombs. The letter says: This plan does not require the United States to stop this production after the plan is proposed and the international organization begins to perform its duties....

What does this mean? It means: The international organization will begin to perform its duties. What kind of organization? A control organization.

But the establishment of control is to prevent the production of atomic bombs. However, the letter of March 17, 1946, says that even when this control organization is already at work, the United States has no intention of stopping the production of atomic bombs.

In the eyes of the leaders who decide U.S. policy, the matter of prohibiting the use of atomic weapons in the field of atomic energy is like this. Those who advocate the establishment of such an international control organization according to the U.S. plan, even when this international control plan is about to be implemented, have not even thought about prohibiting atomic weapons; they do not think they must prohibit the use of atomic weapons. They say: We still need to see—this is subject to the Senate and House of Representatives to decide according to the U.S. Constitution and the interests of the United States as well as general considerations in foreign policy, international situation, etc. This is clearly saying: Although this international control organization that is being established to stop the production of atomic weapons is about to work, the U.S. government has no intention of stopping the production of atomic weapons.

Then, since you do not want to stop the production, why do you want to establish such control to stop the production?

It is very clear that the discussion about such international control is all empty talk, all rhetoric, all a smokescreen to cover up the unwillingness of a certain country to truly prohibit atomic weapons—the most terrible disaster for mankind. Therefore, we are insisting on our position exactly on this point. We propose: Prohibit atomic weapons and, at the same time, establish strict international control.

The U.S. delegation opposes our international control plan based on so-called periodic supervision. I do not want to discuss this issue in detail. I only ask the representatives here to remember what I said in my speech on October 23 last time, when I discussed our suggestions on supervision in the letters of June 11 and September 5, 1947. At that time, we clearly and perfectly proposed our opinions on the organization of supervision, which we believe is a very perfect solution to this problem. And this is not just our opinion.

The international scientific community supports the Soviet Union's proposal for the peoples of all nations to demand that atomic energy be used only for peace.

If one listens to the opinions of authoritative representatives of the British scientific community and the public, one can know how the international scientific community evaluates the Soviet suggestions on supervision. For example, the chairman of the British National Peace Committee, Beale, writes: To establish such control, the West must abandon the suggestion of the majority in the United Nations and adopt the Russian suggestion, and the West must acknowledge that the Russian opposition to the "majority" plan (i.e., the U.S. plan) is reasonable.

British atomic scientist and secretary of the British Atomic Scientists' Committee, Professor Beral, says: If we agree to negotiate on the basis of the suggestions made by the Soviet representative to the United Nations, there will be a broad possibility of reaching an agreement. Contrary to the widely held view, these suggestions can guarantee the prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of highly effective control under the condition that the agreement will be actually observed.

As for the attitude of atomic scientists towards the prohibition of atomic weapons, here are the opinions of some famous scientists.

The famous Australian atomic scientist Oliphant believes that there is no justification for the use of plutonium bombs or hydrogen bombs under any circumstances. He says that the use of atomic weapons would constitute a moral crime. If one compares the authority of Spind in the field of atomic bombs with that of Professor Oliphant, I would certainly prefer to say that Professor Oliphant is a more authoritative atomic physicist and a more just and peace-loving Australian citizen.

I would also like you to know the opinions of twelve famous atomic scientists. They said at the meeting of the American Physical Society at Columbia University: We believe that no country has the right to use such bombs, no matter how pure its motives may be. The hydrogen bomb is not a weapon of war, but a tool for the annihilation of entire nations.

The use of it is the destruction of all moral standards and the destruction of Christian civilization itself. This naturally also applies to atomic bombs.

But what about our position on the atomic issue? I think that as to which side is correct and what suggestions can be implemented in the future, there can be no two opinions. I think it is not the vote in this or that committee, but the vote of the people that will decide this issue. History will judge who is correct. And I am confident that this judgment will certainly not be in favor of the U.S. plan, which violates the interests of the people and the demands of the peoples of all nations, who all demand the prevention of the use of atomic energy for military purposes and the guarantee that the peoples of all nations have ample opportunities to use atomic energy absolutely for peaceful purposes.

The Stockholm Declaration has great power; the warmongers have suffered a powerful blow.

Now, let me talk about the other objections here to our proposal. Here, someone also opposes our proposal to reduce the armed forces of the five major powers by one-third during 1950-1951 and fiercely attacks the Stockholm Declaration; they slander this declaration, saying it is a thoroughly sinister plot and deception. They say that the people who signed the peace declaration are ignorant and have been deceived by experienced propagandists and agitators, etc. They obviously think: They can at least slightly reduce the immense historical significance of the Stockholm Declaration in society, morality, and politics by using this criticism. However, the representative of Sweden, you have indeed apologized for Stockholm, but Stockholm is still Stockholm. In fact, you should not apologize; this is a matter of pride!

But where does the power of this declaration come from? Because it has become the cause of hundreds of millions of people, it has become the cause of the people mentioned by those who speak of it with such contempt in this meeting of high-ranking officials and the ruling classes of the U.S.-British bloc countries, it has become the cause of millions of people who refuse to be cannon fodder, who refuse to be tools for carrying out plans of aggression, and who have personally taken up the cause of peace. It must be understood that no matter how the peace fighters are suppressed, as is currently being done in the United States by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the so-called Un-American Activities Committee, listing them as "dangerous individuals"; no matter how they are beaten and arrested, as is being done by the ruling classes of some countries that are trying to deal with the peace fighters in other ways; no matter how they are framed, as is being done by the respectable and semi-respectable gentlemen in their public speeches; no matter what means are used, they will never be able to stop the growth and consolidation of the democratic forces that are fighting for peace, for opposing the reactionary forces that are preparing for war.

The rude attacks on the peace fighters here by some representatives indicate how powerful they are at present. The attacks made by some representatives in this committee indicate how strongly the Stockholm Declaration has struck all the conspirators and warmongers who endanger peace.

The Soviet Union not only advocates the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons but also the reduction of armaments and armed forces by the five powers.

Now, let me talk about the issue of reducing armaments. To divert attention from the need to abolish the atomic bomb, someone has invented such exaggerated language, saying that it is not the atomic bomb but the tank that is the most terrifying weapon.

Yang and others have said that tanks alone, without atomic weapons, can cruelly destroy the lives of millions of people. This is of course correct. Every world war has destroyed the lives of millions of people. Every world war—the first and second world wars have shown this—always uses tanks and all other kinds of deadly weapons to take the lives of tens of millions of people.

But why mention tanks? Is this to explain that tanks are as dangerous as atomic weapons in the large-scale slaughter of people? So, does this mean that there is no need to ban the use of atomic weapons? Is this not the reason why the "six-nation" proposal does not propose to at least declare the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons?

Incidentally, if the critics of our proposals think that tanks are precisely such dangerous weapons, then why do they not raise the issue of banning tanks? Why do they not raise this issue together with the prohibition of atomic weapons? Why do they not mention tanks in their proposals regarding the establishment of an international control organization to effectively enforce the command to prohibit atomic weapons? Why is this? It does not make sense logically.

We have said before, we say now, and we propose: Prohibit atomic weapons and all kinds of weapons used to slaughter people on a large scale and all basic types of so-called weapons of mass destruction, and distinguish these weapons from those that can slaughter people but are not weapons of mass destruction.

It is necessary to understand this distinction. Tanks can destroy a group of people, but tanks are not blind weapons used for the large-scale destruction of people. Atomic weapons are terrifying because they are blind weapons. They do not take visible targets as the object of destruction but take mostly civilians as the object of destruction.

But we say—look at our proposals—atomic weapons are the most terrifying and cruel weapons; we are not only against atomic weapons but also against all other weapons of mass destruction of people, just as we did in the discussions here last year and the year before last.

But what about tanks? Obviously, tanks are weapons; when we say to the five powers: "Let us reduce our armaments and armed forces by one-third in 1950-1951 as a first step and then take other measures to reduce weapons," we are also referring to tanks. We are talking about all kinds of weapons. But this proposal was not accepted by the majority. The majority rejected this proposal, saying it was not possible because it would put the countries in an unequal position.

For example, Austin said here: To reduce the Western "small-scale" armies in this proportion is equivalent to depriving the Atlantic countries of many of their existing defensive forces. What "small-scale" Western armies is he talking about? We are only talking about the armies of the five major powers: England, France, the Soviet Union, China, and the United States.

Therefore, this proposal has nothing to do with the other participants of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Someone tells us that this is impossible because it is said that this would strike the military potential of those countries whose military strength is relatively weaker than that of the Soviet Union—let us say so—would be affected. So let us see, for example, the so-called military potential of the main country in the North Atlantic Alliance, the United States?

We can look at the U.S. military budget.

Regarding the position of the Soviet delegation, Spind made some distortions and sophistry.

When talking about the budget, I did not compare the military needs of the Soviet Union and the United States. I have understood and still understand that due to the characteristics of the structure of the Soviet and U.S. budgets themselves, it is very difficult to make such a comparison in this regard. I was talking about something else. I will compare the military expenditures of each country separately—compare the Soviet Union separately and the United States separately.

My respected colleague Baranovskiy has already talked about the U.S. budget here, correctly pointing out that during Truman's presidency, the military expenditures were several times larger than the entire military expenditures of the previous thirty-two U.S. presidents. But I want to look at this issue from another angle.

First, regarding the Soviet budget. I said and I affirm: In 1940, our expenditures for military needs accounted for 32.6% of our budget, in 1946 it was 23.9%, in 1949 it was 19.2%, and in 1950 it was 18.5%. These figures are published in our newspapers. What can be objected to this?

But Spind and his ilk have objections. They say, "First, no one knows how much the Soviet Union spends on military needs," but if no one knows, how does Spind know?

Spind says: "Second, these expenditures are enormous." But since Spind admits that no one knows this, how can he make such a claim?

Spind says: "Third, ..." The third point, he does not say anymore. He thinks he has said enough. Here, I am reminded of the story of Nasreddin. He borrowed a pot from his neighbor but did not return it. When the neighbor came to ask for it, he said: "First, I did not take your pot, second, I broke your pot, third, even if the pot was broken, I returned it to you long ago." Now, Spind—this young Australian Nasreddin—follows this logic exactly.

But what about the military potential of the United States?

U.S. President Truman, in defending the U.S. budget for the fiscal year 1950, said word for word: "The budget proposes to maintain the strongest armed forces that our country has ever maintained in peacetime." What does this mean? It means that in 1950, the U.S. armed forces were stronger than at any other time in U.S. history.

Everyone also knows that in 1949-50, the U.S. allocated more than $13 billion, while in the pre-war years of 1938-39, it was $1 billion, exceeding the pre-war allocation by twelve times. The U.S. plans to spend around $500 billion in the 1950-51 fiscal year, which is fifty times more than the 1938-39 fiscal year.

But how do some famous U.S. military experts themselves estimate the situation of the U.S. armed forces?

I would like to read a few sentences excerpted from the conclusions of an authoritative military expert. He says: "In the atomic weapons race, the United States is almost certainly in the lead." This expert says: "We have already obtained, or we have the possibility to obtain new atomic weapons, lighter atomic bombs, more powerful than those used on Japan, which can be used by ground or naval forces, cities, and industrial centers, and have the same effect."

One expert says: "We have a numerical and qualitative advantage, and due to our superior industrial potential, this advantage is becoming more and more obvious."

The third person says: "We have hegemony in atomic bombs, and at the same time, we have hegemony in strategic bombers."

The fourth person says: "We have the tools, technology, equipment, experience, and weapons necessary to turn our bombers into terrible destructive tools."

The fifth person points out: "Our naval aircraft are the best in the world. In the air force, we have an advantage in naval aircraft. The U.S. Navy is the largest navy in the world. Our shipbuilding potential is unmatched by any other country" and so on.

Then there is another person who says: We can say that we have a very small number of armed forces, insignificant—this is what Austin said, we cannot agree to reduce the "small" armed forces of the West. Austin said, this would mean "stripping the Atlantic countries of many of their defensive forces." These people try to describe the military potential of the United States as unable to reduce its armed forces by one-third. Moreover, Spind and his colleagues claim that, on the other hand, the Soviet Union has four million ground troops. So, they know how many ground troops the Soviet Union has. Since this is the case, why do they still blame us for not providing any information about our armed forces and not reporting how many ground troops we have?

The Syrian representative Al-Ghuri spoke here and raised the following question: What does the reduction of armaments mean? He said that it is necessary to determine a certain minimum number for a country and its neighboring countries for the sake of security interests, and to reduce the remaining armed forces.

If the principle of reducing armaments is adopted, the Soviet Union is willing to provide sufficient information on this matter.

In this case, I ask: What principle is used to determine the number of troops needed for the security of, for example, the Soviet Union and the United States? The length of the border? The territory? Of course, if the border line is drawn from Kyushu Island through what MacArthur calls the "unsinkable aircraft carrier" Taiwan to the Philippines, if the border line of the United States is drawn like this, then any demand and proposal can be made. But since we are talking about military potential, we must consider the entire armed forces, not just the ground troops. Of course, for this reason, sufficient information is needed. Mr. Yang and Mr. Spind, this is where the information is needed—not just any kind of information obtained from some spies who often lose their conscience or from those generals who wear sheep skins and boots in the countryside, wandering in the backyards of some factories, trying to peek through the still unopened doors and windows (as Mr. Bevin said) behind them—but information provided by the government itself. If you are willing to sit at a table with us to talk and study how to truly reduce these armed forces according to the principles we agree on, we are always willing to provide any information about our armed forces.

We propose the following principle: Reduce all armed forces—air force, navy, and ground troops—by one-third. Someone says to us: "Give us the information." We reply: "If a decision is made on the principle of reducing armed forces and armaments, then you will receive sufficient information about our armed forces and armaments at the same time as similar information about other major powers is provided." But of course, when you say, "Give us the information, then we will consider the reduction," we will ask: "What do you want the information for?" We have the right to believe that the request for information is for ulterior motives.

When returning to the issue of military potential, I must point out that the U.S. experts, who are proud of their military strength, are trying to intimidate the nervous, but at the same time, they provide sufficient materials to expose the tears of some representatives here, the unnatural and artificial poverty. These representatives talk about: The military potential of the Western armies is insufficient, therefore, they cannot pass our proposal to reduce the "small" armed forces of the West by one-third in 1950-1951.

The United States is engaged in a frenzied arms race, establishing more and more U.S. bases around the world, and allocating tens of billions of dollars for military purposes—these are all undeniable facts that show that the foreign policy of the U.S. ruling class is being implemented and is being fully implemented.

Here are some facts. In 1947, the United States signed an agreement with the Philippines. According to this agreement, the United States leased more than twenty bases for a period of ninety-nine years. The United States is fortifying the various islands of the Philippines, building new military bases, for example, in the north of Luzon, in Mindanao, and other places.

After the collapse of the Chiang Kai-shek regime in China, the United States lost some of its bases in China (Qingdao, Kunming, Chengdu, Guilin, and other places), the U.S. government moved its military bases to Taiwan. As is known, Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory, and foreign troops are stationed there in violation of the will and wishes of the Chinese government and without the permission of the Chinese government, which is a gross violation of the main principles of international law. In China, the legal government is the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, not others. The United States also has military bases in Okinawa and Surabaya. Similarly, it must be said that: The United States, especially with the help of the Franco government, has established bases in the Mediterranean. It is a well-known fact that the Franco government allows the U.S. government to freely use Spanish airfields, air force bases, and naval air bases. The same must be said about: Portugal also has such a situation.

It can also be mentioned that many U.S. bases in other parts of the world—in the Near East and the Middle East, the North Atlantic and the Arctic, these places are currently of particular interest to the U.S. ruling class. The internal reasons for the U.S. ruling class's particular concern were already revealed by General Spaatz in 1947; he was then the commander of the U.S. Air Force. He issued the following statement: "Under the current range of operations, flights over the Arctic have important strategic significance. Four-engine aircraft flying from bases in the far north over the Arctic can attack industrial centers in the other hemisphere."

This is the direction of U.S. hegemony, desire, intention, wish, hope, and plan. I think only those who lie deliberately or are ignorant can still say, as we just heard from the U.S. representative, such words in front of these facts. In conclusion, I want to talk about the part of Austin's speech that specifically discusses the attitude of the Soviet government towards war.

Everyone remembers that he quoted some words from the literary journal in 1946, the resolution of the Sixth Congress of the Communist International held in 1928, and others. He tried to prove that when the Western countries reduce their armies, as he said, even if they greatly reduce them—we just saw how they reduce their armies, especially the United States—Soviet newspapers call for, as Austin calls it, "love of war, struggle, and victory."

Austin is so obsessed with trying to portray the Soviet Union as a fierce militaristic country at any cost that he even risks saying that in the "ideology of the Soviet regime," there is not "a single clear statement of hatred for war." He cites a few disjointed, incoherent words as evidence, saying that therefore, we cannot know "what the Soviet Union considers peace and what it considers war."

When Austin tries to discuss the attitude of the Soviet Union towards war, his mind's desperate confusion is obviously evident from these words.

For example, he even says that the policy of the Soviet Union is such a policy: people cannot know what it considers war and what it considers peace. What is the basis for this statement? An article in the literary journal. But even if the literary journal said the words mentioned here, it is neither the official organ of the Soviet government, nor the official organ of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and moreover, I want to point out that the literary journal did not say those words.

For example, someone mentions the Sixth Congress of the Communist International held in 1928. But everyone knows: The Communist Party Congress has no responsibility for the decisions made by the Communist Party, the Soviet government knows how to distinguish between party issues, issues of the Communist movement, and policy and state issues that fall within the jurisdiction of the Soviet government. Can Austin bother to give some more recent examples? Because the literary journal he mentioned is four years old, and the Sixth Congress of the Communist International he mentioned is a matter of twenty-two years ago. How can one use such outdated materials to confirm or deny anything about the present?

Moreover, on October 12, 1948, the Political Committee met in this hall, and Austin also quoted the same passage from the literary journal and the resolution of the Sixth Congress of the Communist International. He quoted the same literary journal from 1946 and the same Sixth Congress of the Communist International. But what did the literary journal and the resolution of the Sixth Congress really say? Austin does not understand the political significance of the words he mechanically quoted.

The great Russian writer Gogol has a character named Petrushka who likes to read books, especially almanacs. But what interests him is only the act of reading itself. He knows the letters, he can combine the letters into syllables, and he can read the words, but what do the words mean? He does not understand the meaning of the words. When reading documents, the most important thing is to understand what you are reading, not just to repeat the words. Even parrots can mimic, but they do not understand the meaning of what they repeat.

First, I would like to draw attention to the fact that Austin does not limit himself to quoting the above two passages. He also cites a speech by Marshal Stalin on February 9, 1946, at a meeting of Moscow voters, and draws conclusions from the speech that are completely inconsistent with the original speech. Austin, how he dared to walk onto the international stage with some irresponsible people preparing documents for him, even without proofreading the original text of the document, is truly astonishing.

Austin tries to raise the fundamental issue of war and the attitude of the Soviet Union towards war. He does not even read the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) briefly, in which the theory of just and unjust wars of Lenin is explained in the most popular way.

When talking about this theory, Austin only says: "According to Lenin, a just war is a war to liberate the people from capitalist slavery," and he says, "that is to expand the interests of the Soviet state." But Lenin did not say such a thing as "that is." Moreover, Austin distorts Lenin's definition of a just war. According to Lenin's words, a just war is a "non-aggressive war, a war of liberation, whose purpose is either to defend the people from external attacks and attempts to enslave them, or to liberate the people from capitalist slavery, or finally, to liberate the colonies and protectorates from the oppression of the imperialists." This is what Lenin calls a "just war."

According to Lenin's words, a war of liberation by the colonized countries to free themselves from the status of being subordinate to and enslaved by the imperialists is also a just war. According to Lenin's will, if the oppressed peoples of these subordinate colonies wage war against imperialist slavery, this is a just war; if they wage war against the invaders of their country and those who try to enslave their country, this is a just war; if they wage war to free themselves from the status of slavery—including imperialist slavery—this is also a just war.

In U.S. history, there have been such wars. For example: The democratic and freedom-loving North America waged war against the slave-owning South America. This was a war of liberation, a just war. I think the U.S. representative will agree with my opinion on this point.

I can also give another example of a war of liberation. This is the war against the Hitler invaders. On November 6, 1941, when the Hitler gangsters were approaching the gates of Moscow, Marshal Stalin, the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet armed forces and the Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, addressed the Moscow Council of Labor Deputies, speaking of the inevitable collapse of the Hitler imperialists and the great significance of the cooperation between the English, Soviet, and American allies at that time to resist the German fascist imperialists. At that time, Stalin said in his speech:

"Lenin divided wars into two types: predatory, and therefore unjust, wars, and wars of liberation, and therefore just wars.

"The Germans are now waging a predatory war, an unjust war; its purpose is to seize the territory of other countries, to enslave other peoples. This is why all honest people must rise up against the German invaders, regard them as enemies.

"In contrast to Hitler Germany, the Soviet Union and its allies are waging a war of liberation, a just war; its purpose is to liberate the enslaved peoples of Europe and the Soviet Union from the brutal rule of Hitler. This is why all honest people must support the armies of the Soviet Union, Britain, and other allies, regard them as armies of liberation."

This is a war of liberation, a just war!

We support such wars, and we believe that when the issue concerns such wars, one must not exaggerate their horrors to frighten the people. Only the accomplices of the invaders, only the traitors of the people can do this. Patriots in such wars do not fear any sacrifices and bloodshed, because this is a matter of defending the motherland against foreign invaders. At such times, if the elements who create panic, hypocrisy, and pacifism come out to frighten the people with the "horrors of war," we will say: No, pacifism is the accomplice of the enemy. Stalin, in a letter to Gorky in 1930, which Austin here shamelessly distorts its meaning, contains precisely this meaning.

Stalin wrote at that time: "The question of war cannot be separated from the question of politics, war is a form of political expression." Stalin, in his letter to Gorky, said: "The bookstores have a large number of novels that describe the 'horrors of war' and instill anti-war sentiments (not only imperialist wars but also other kinds of wars), these bourgeois pacifist stories have little value."

"We are against imperialist wars because they are counter-revolutionary wars. But we support wars against imperialism, wars of liberation, revolutionary wars; although, as everyone knows, this kind of war not only cannot avoid but is even full of 'blood and horror.'"

These are the noble words spoken by our teacher in a letter to Gorky in 1939, which Austin, sir, distorts everything, saying it is a call for war, citing it as an example of violating the resolution to prohibit war propaganda. But, do we prohibit self-defense wars, just wars, wars against invaders, wars against aggressors? No, our charter encourages us to engage in such struggles. The charter is to prohibit predatory, aggressive wars! No matter how difficult the self-defense war is, as long as it is a war against invaders, a war against aggressors, as long as it is a great war that Lenin once said and great Stalin now says is a just war, our organization will come to protect it—the charter.

The letter from Stalin, the Great Marshal, to Gorky in 1930 contains the same Leninist principles, clearly defining the unjust nature of imperialist wars such as the war of aggression, and clearly determining our attitude towards war. Only those who are ignorant and uneducated cannot understand the dividing line between just and unjust wars, and if they cannot even distinguish the dividing line between war and peace, then they are even more ignorant and uneducated.

Austin's statement is completely baseless and brutally distorts the true meaning of Stalin's speech.

Austin makes even more outrageous statements. He claims that the Soviet regime believes that wars are not caused by fascist countries but by the economic system of Western countries, and this view of the Soviet Union became evident in February 1946. To prove this, he quotes a few passages from Stalin's speech in February, where it says that the outbreak of the Second World War is the inevitable result of the development of the world's economic and political forces on the basis of today's monopoly capitalism.

Austin also claims—using his words—that the monopolists who start wars according to the Soviet language are precisely those countries that assisted the Soviet Union in conducting the anti-German invasion war during the war. Therefore, this speech on February 9 precisely means the end of the policy of cooperation during the war.

This statement is strange, gentlemen! This statement is strange because it brutally distorts the true meaning of the speech on February 9. To fully understand this, you only need to read the speech yourself, even without my help. In the aforementioned speech, there is absolutely no basis for the kind of inference made by Austin, not a single fact or any hint of what Austin said, not even a hint of such a suggestion. Moreover, in the speech on February 9, Marshal Stalin clearly points out that the Second World War against the Axis countries is different from the First World War, this war has been a war against fascism from the beginning, and one of its tasks is to restore democratic freedom. In the speech on February 9, Marshal Stalin said: "The Soviet Union's participation in the war against the Axis countries has only strengthened—and indeed strengthened—the anti-fascist and liberating nature of the Second World War." This means that we at that time, together with the United States, Britain, and other countries currently attending this meeting, waged a war of liberation against the fascist invaders.

Austin does not mention the following fact at all, that is, Stalin said in this brilliant speech: "It is on this basis (the basis of the war of liberation against the German invaders—the note of Vyshinsky), that the anti-fascist alliance of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and other freedom-loving countries was formed, and it later played a decisive role in the defeat of the armies of the Axis countries." Does this not suffice to understand the words spoken on February 9, to understand the justice of the war, and to understand how Austin brutally distorts the facts, claiming that the speech on February 9 is the Soviet Union turning to destroy its friendly relations with other countries, with those countries that had friendly relations with the Soviet Union during the war?

Where did Austin's words come from? Where did he get them from? This is a brutal and slanderous distortion of the facts.

Now, I will say a few words about our proposal to conclude a five-power peace treaty. In essence, here, there is only one objection to the substance of the declaration, apart from one objection, there is no other objection, the only objection is that since we already have the United Nations Charter, what is the need for such a treaty? Why repeat it? But let me ask, then why pass the six-nation proposal, or the Bolivian proposal, which repeats some articles of the Charter? Why?

However, can it be allowed to reason in such a way, saying that since there is the Charter, then everything else is redundant? To present some of the principles of the Charter in today's political actual form and to organize our joint forces on this basis so that the principles declared in the Charter can be implemented, is this not necessary? Even if the Charter is not well implemented or is violated, the Charter is still the Charter. However, this does not exclude the necessity of making decisions based on the principle clauses of the Charter, and in the current political situation, passing these decisions will only strengthen the importance of the principles expressed in the Charter.

Otherwise, it would be necessary to oppose all practical actions based on the Charter, or it would be necessary to start practical actions that are contrary to the Charter, because such actions are precisely what the Charter does not have. However, this is a novel proposal.

The Soviet Union proposes to conclude a five-power treaty to maintain peace because it is an important measure to ensure the security of all countries.

We are proposing a treaty—a five-power treaty. Why five powers? Because these five countries bear a special responsibility, not the main responsibility, and not just a general responsibility (the main responsibility is borne by the Security Council, and the general responsibility to maintain peace is borne by all of us together), because these five countries, for very understandable reasons, hold the great power of peace and war. The initiation of a world war depends on them, and the strengthening of international peace also depends on them, because they hold the greatest means of war and peace. This is a fact, and we must take this fact into account.

Does Nicaragua have a fault because it does not have air force and navy like the United States? No, it does not. But if Nicaragua participates in the implementation of our common measures to strengthen peace, it can contribute its share to the general cause of strengthening peace. In the Second World War, the small countries did the same. It is the same in this matter. If there is truly a desire for peace, then why do we not all accept the proposal to conclude such a treaty? We have such a desire. We believe that such a treaty is useful. We know that even from the point of view of strengthening trust discussed here, such a treaty will have an extraordinarily great social and political significance.

Indeed, every ordinary person will say: "Yes, look, no matter how different their opinions are, they have agreed to jointly maintain peace! This means that we can work for our bread in peace, we can sleep in peace, we can raise our children in peace, knowing that they will not become victims of atomic bombs." Is this not of great political significance? Undoubtedly, it is.

This is why the Soviet delegation fully supports its proposal to conclude a five-power treaty to strengthen peace, because it believes that such a treaty is one of the most important measures to maintain peace, eliminate the threat of a new war, and ensure the security of all countries.

　　十月二十八日联合国大会第一（政治及安全）委员会上
    维辛斯基关于“制止新战争威胁巩固世界和平与安全”案演说全文
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约三十日电：维辛斯基一九五○年十月二十八日在联合国大会第一（政治及安全）委员会中就“制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全”案发表演说，全文如下：
    我们委员会中有某些人想避而不讨论苏联代表团所提出的“制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全”案，然而这种企图全部失败了。不仅如此，苏联代表团在这个问题上所采取的主动已迫使某些代表团跟着这条路走，提出了它们自己对这个问题的提案。玻利维亚提案的提案人不得不承认，他之所以这样做，正同六国提案的提案人一样，是由于害怕世界舆论；他们害怕，反对苏联的提案会激起一切正直的人民、所有谴责战争贩子和爱好和平的民族的义愤。
    苏联提案符合一切正直人们愿望而使美英集团处于很狼狈的地位
    玻利维亚代表公开宣称：严格说来，苏联提案本应完全加以否决；但是说到这里，他又说：如果光是把这个提案否决掉，可能会——用他的话来说——落入苏联宣传的圈套，而苏联的提案中——这是他承认的——又包含了某些好的东西，所以就更其否决不得了。新西兰代表虽然公开攻击我们的提案，可是他不得不承认这个提案非常有吸引力，可能成为一种“钓饵”。荷兰代表也谈到这个问题，他认为：对于苏联的提案，第一委员会的主要任务是要消除一种唯独有苏联爱好和平的印象。
    由此可见，玻利维亚代表团提案、六国提案以及希腊代表团刚才提出的提案之所以会出现，是由于英美集团发现它们自己处在一个很狼狈的地位。律师们把这种处境叫做极端迫不得已的情况，使人不得不采取违反自己心愿的行动。
    我暂且不谈这三个提案的问题，因为后面我们还有机会来谈到它。我想先直接谈谈那些抨击我们的各项建议、抨击我们的宣言草案的人们。
    首先应该这样说：那些可以被认为是最有意义的演说的独特之处，是它们企图不惜一切代价——甚至不惜歪曲和捏造事实——来诽谤苏联代表团的建议，并连同一起诽谤整个苏联的外交政策。在这方面特别热心的是美国代表。奥斯汀在他的十月二十六日的演说中说：苏联今年是在武装侵略的情况下提出这些建议的，而照他说，正是这个提案的提案人在支持和鼓励这个武装侵略。
    这是完完全全不负责任的挑拨的说话。这使我不得不回顾一下朝鲜局势的发展过程，并追述一下苏联代表团在第一委员会和大会讨论朝鲜局势时所提出过的，证实美国侵略朝鲜的许多证据。这些证据没有人驳倒过。正是在那个时候，奥斯汀先生和他的朋友们似乎很可以提出一些文件，引证一些事实并提供一些证据出来，以便证明“北朝鲜发动侵略”的说法。
    但是当这个问题在会上讨论，而且讨论了相当长时间的时候，这类的东西却一点也没有提出来，因为美国代表当时和现在都没有丝毫的事实和丝毫的证据可以提出来反驳美国侵略朝鲜的证据。
    英美集团拒绝在这里以及在大会或安理会中听取北朝鲜代表的意见，这是一个事实。听取北朝鲜代表的意见本来是公平而且合理的，是客观地对待这个问题所必需的。
    由于目前这个问题牵涉到朝鲜，我们应该指出，朝鲜这个屠场的组织者在朝鲜发动军事冒险以后，粗暴地破坏了国际义务和国际法还不罢休，他们竟然利用日本军队与朝鲜人民作战。这是我们一再讲过，而且拿出证据来证明了的。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外相朴宪永曾于十月十四日发表声明，这个声明已分发给联合国的各会员国。声明中提出事实证明日本军与美军联合在朝鲜作战，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国有正当理由对这种事情提出抗议。
    我们完全支持这个抗议，因为这种行动是美国彰明昭著地破坏关于日本战后地位的国际协定，破坏联合国组织的基本原则。
    从这一切无可置辩的事实——我再说一声，这是无可置辩的事实——看来，奥斯汀所说的关于武装侵略的话——硬说这个侵略获得本提案的提案人的鼓励——就显得特别是虚妄和伪善的了。
    有了这些事实，奥斯汀本来应该不再阴谋诽谤苏联提案的提案人了。但是，奥斯汀毫不犹豫，毫无约束一下自己不去搞这种诡计，很明显的，他企图阻挠冷静地讨论苏联的重要建议。他竟然说：苏联代表回到联合国后，就成了侵略者的代表。此外，奥斯汀在提到斯大林大元帅十月十二日的电报之后，还作了粗暴的诽谤攻击，苏联代表团愤慨地将这种攻击置之不理。
    奥斯汀无法抵抗我们在讨论朝鲜局势时所提出的事实，因为这些事实无可辩驳地证明了“北朝鲜发动侵略”的说法是完全站不住脚的，揭穿了美国确是在侵略朝鲜人民。奥斯汀攻击——这种攻击虽然来得迟了一些，但都是很凶暴的——维护朝鲜人民的正义事业的人们。他采取了卑鄙肮脏的讽刺和诽谤。但是，他应该知道，俗话说得好，造谣中伤无济于事，过不了几天总会给戳穿的。
    苏联认为必须进行有效积极斗争以更坚决的方法谴责战争煽动者
    在还没有直接谈到讨论我们宣言草案的情形之前，我想先谈谈新战争的宣传问题。
    苏联代表团提出它的宣言草案，它所主张的是什么呢？它主张宣告：大会谴责若干国家内所进行的新战争宣传，并要求所有国家禁止在它们的国家进行这种宣传并惩办进行这种宣传的人。
    有人说：这样的决议已在一九四七年通过了。这是错误的。这样的决议并不曾通过。在这种问题上曾经通过了一个决议，但是这个决议是不够的，虽然这个决议如果有效地实现了的话——这是我的希望——在当时和现在都会是有益处的。可惜它并没有能够实现。因此必须加强这个决议，必须再次提醒联合国各会员国：它们参加这样一个追求着崇高目的的组织——它的目的是在各民族和国家间建立起友善睦邻的和平关系，反对任何煽动新战争、破坏和平和阻挠各国间友好关系的企图——与它们国家内的新闻机关和个人——这里把他们叫作不负责任、说无聊话的人——的行动是不相容的，与这个国家里高踞要津的代表、著名的政治人物和政治领袖们的行动更是不相容的。这些人在从事疯狂的新战争宣传中毫不迟疑地公开宣称必需与苏联和人民民主国家作战。
    事实上，在这样的情况下，苏联政府认为它的职责乃是不满足于三年前通过的关于同类问题的决议，而且要建议再度宣布谴责战争宣传，宣布决心进行有效的积极的斗争来反对战争煽动者和战争贩子，并且用比大会一九四七年通过的方法更为坚决的方法来进行这一斗争。
    就是因为这个原故，我们现在的草案中包含有追究进行这种罪恶宣传的罪人的新规定。
    这是从前通过的一九四七年十一月三日决议的必要的而且重要的补充。它之所以必要是因为战争贩子不肯罢休，是因为联合国组织必须采取更坚决的措施来对付这些先生们，以便遏制肆无忌惮的和平之敌。他们的活动构成了具有世界规模的显明的公开危险。我们就是这样看这个问题的。
    奥斯汀杨格使用相同的杜撰材料诬蔑苏联的文化批评为敌视外界
    奥斯汀对这一重要问题采取的不是严肃的态度，他反而开始寻找一些借口，来阻挠这一高尚的提案通过。但是正如过去所料，他并没有找到合适的借口；因此他就不得不硬说苏联违犯联合国大会一九四七年十一月三日的决议，硬说在联合国大会通过上述决议后，过了一周，苏联就开始了一个现代史上几乎空前未有的官方策动的敌视外界的时期，但他又举不出任何证明。
    凑巧得很，英国代表杨格也发表了字句完全一样的类似声明。
    显然，杨格和奥斯汀两人根据同一来源，使用同一种杜撰材料。
    这一在历史上空前未有的“敌视外界的”时期原来只不过是（代表先生们，你们以为怎样？）对于在西方与资本主义文化面前献媚和奴颜婢膝地拜服的批评——当时在苏联进行、现在也仍在进行的批评！
    在这里，我们可以首先问一问：在什么地方有什么国际规则与原则禁止批评西方世界的文化著名的史本格勒（他把这种文化称为“西方的衰微”），为什么我们没有权利批评在美国培养起来的那种诸如文学、戏剧与电影的倾向！在美国，这种文化的作品中的主要的和为人们所爱好的主人公是土匪、谋杀者和匪徒。他们用他们的恶毒的影响毒害青年一代的心灵，造成在犯罪案件总数中刑事犯占这样危险的百分比。我看见美国代表惊奇地望着我。他大概第一次听说这样事情。是的，我们反对向西方文化献媚和奴颜婢膝地拜服，但我们宣布，这是我们本国的事情，而且此外，它与战争宣传问题也毫无关系。连三尺童子也应该明白这一点。
    当时的外交部长莫洛托夫在艾奇逊所提到的纪念伟大十月社会主义革命三十周年的报告中说，旧俄罗斯的统治阶级对于在资本主义的意义上说来比较发达的国家在精神上常常有很大依赖性。
    莫洛托夫在那时就指出：由于这种情况，因而有可能在若干旧知识分子中间培养，认为我们国家以及我们文化不如欧洲资产阶级国家并在精神上要依赖这些国家的奴性意识。
    奥斯汀显然从来没有想到过：这不是一个敌视外界的问题，而是一个培养人民的民族尊严感，培养人民对他们民族文化的热爱的问题。这种民族文化对于每一个民族说，都有它自己的重要性，但是每一个民族——不论大小——都将它的文化贡献给人类文化与文明的总宝库。俄罗斯民族与苏维埃国家其他许多民族在这一方面已经做了不少的事情。对于这个宝库，它们已提供了一份丰厚的贡献，那就是我们在文化、科学、艺术、文学、批评、戏剧及电影各方面的举世知名的作品。
    一切人应该明白：向其他国家奴颜婢膝地拜服与谄媚将使任何民族陷于停滞，并且是这个民族在精神及文化上的发展的致命危险。
    但是，奥斯汀大概不懂这一点。他把这个称为敌视外界的宣传，仿佛宣传对于一个人本民族的爱以及宣传其本民族文化的充分价值就是敌视另一民族的文化的表现。然而，奥斯汀十月二十六日企图辩护的却正是这一点。那一天，他认为要人们爱他们本国的文化以及培养对民族尊严的尊重的这种宣传是反对其他民族的文化及民族尊严的敌对行为，而且硬说这违犯了联大一九四七年十一月三日关于新战争宣传的决议。
    还有比这种推论更荒谬的事吗？我只能衷心为奥斯汀先生及其秘书们感到可悲，这些秘书可能比他自己更要对这种荒谬奇谈负责，他们把这种杜撰材料交给他，而这一材料究竟在说些什么也显然毫无清楚概念。
    新战争宣传并未减弱反而更剧烈联合国不应对这种事实毫无反应
    若干代表们，特别是杨格（英国）与斯宾德（澳大利亚）在讨论我们的提案时企图在这里断言，苏联每年提出关于加强国际和平与安全的提案，但同时却又采取截然相反的行动，鼓励战争宣传，允许进行蓄意憎恨西方各国政府的宣传运动，——照他们的说法。这在本质上正象我刚才揭露奥斯汀关于敌视外界的宣传运动的诽谤谰言时所说到的东西一样。因此，没有必要特别详论这个问题。然而我必须引证事实，一般地驳斥杨格先生与斯宾德先生之流的这种说法。
    事实是，在一九四七年——在斯宾德先生的演说中曾经提到这一年——苏联提出了关于谴责新战争宣传的建议，而在这个时候，在美国、英国以及若干其他国家内却在狂热地进行着关于这种战争的宣传。我们当时引证了不少事实，举出了战争贩子们的名字并揭露了他们的侵略计划。无人能够否认这些事实，然而正是这些事实，正是这些国家中的这种情况，迫使苏联政府在大会中坚持必须采取坚决的措施来制止这种罪恶的活动，这种活动事实上威胁了和平与安全。
    事实是那样不容置辩，局势甚至对于能够永久容忍这种罪恶宣传的最有耐心的人也是那样不可容忍，以至联大不得不通过谴责这种宣传的决议——一九四七年十一月三日的决议；那时参加第一委员会及参加过二届联大而现在在这里的代表们一定还记得，尽管奥斯汀发出歇斯底里的叫嚣，说什么必须“击败”苏联的提案，但联大却不得不通过上项决议。
    事实证明他们并没有能“击败”这个提案。一九四七年十一月三日的决议就是根据该提案中的这个思想，这个思想现在也存在，若干代表团现在在他们的提案中也提到它。这个思想要求：今天在目前情况下，应在符合于这种思想的意义和本质的形式中得到确认并使其实现。这就是我们所建议的。
    一九四七年的情形就是这样。但我们并不关切一九四七年的事情，我们关切现在所发生的事情，现在所发生的事情使我们认为，新战争的挑拨者并未罢休，新战争的宣传并未减弱，甚至反而剧烈起来，并采用了更尖锐因而对和平事业更危险的新的方式。就是因为这个原故联合国不能，例如象奥斯汀那样，不管和忽视这些事件，并且不能对象贩卖战争、象经常地、不断地在有系统地越来越大的规模上以咄咄逼人的方式散播仇恨人类的有毒种子之类的可耻的事实毫无反应。
    美国政客叫嚣用原子弹攻击苏联这些人们只应该尽速送入疯人院
    先生们，一个人不能够听任例如美国众议院军事委员会委员、印第安纳州众议员华尔锡（Ｗalsh），而不是有人在这里提到的任何不负责任的人发表那种声明，他今年八月在邮局雇员大会上厚颜地宣称，美国在苏联纷纷投下原子弹的时候日益接近了。
    想一想这句话是什么意思吧！想想一切正直的人对这种声明必须有什么样的反应吧。如果其他国家的任何政治家、议会委员会的委员说我们向你们的国家纷纷投下原子弹的时候已在不远，美国将说什么呢？你们将说什么呢？你们会说，这个人不是一个漏网的罪犯，就是一个逃脱的疯子，必须立即给他穿上疯人衣，一定不能让他再做美国众院军委会的委员。
    如果我们——联合国组织——作为一个有责任维持国际和平，增进各国间和好睦邻关系的组织，不是要自杀，那么这样的事实是不能容忍的。不管你们和我们的政治见解、政治制度、社会结构、经济结构等等如何，不管一切事情如何，每一个进入国际关系领域的人都必须具有一种最低限度的道德上的条件。这种最低限度的条件，与挑拨战争的怙恶不悛的罪犯们的这种野蛮见解——无论他们占据多高的地位——是不合的，是不能调和的。
    我们说，人们不能听任塔姆巴城（佛罗里达州）大学的校长——请注意他是校长——一位叫做南斯（Ｎance）的发表那样的声明。他，这位校长，这位青年的教育家，这位“启蒙者”在声明中说：我认为我们必须根据蛮荒的法则进行全面的准备。每一个人都必须学会如何屠杀。南斯说，我将同意细菌战，使用毒气、原子、氰弹，及发射到别的大陆去的火箭。我将不要求对医院、教堂、教育机关或任何居民团体采取仁慈的态度……先生们，你们对于这种奉以诚实的科学之名而从大学的讲座上散播这种狂言的博士、校长、教授会有什么话说呢？我们必须怎样看待这种我们都称之为“母校”，即教养之母，而它的校长却散播这种狂言的大学呢？这种教授必须和华尔锡一道尽速送入疯人院。让他作疯人院的院长吧。他在疯人中间将是正常的，但在正常人之间他自然就是疯子了。
    这里是第三个事实。众议院拨款委员会主席密苏里州的凯农先生也公开煽动用原子弹攻击苏联。他自然忘记了一件简单的事实，就是会有炸弹来回敬炸弹。产联书记加莱在本年初公开宣称，在上次大战中，他们团结共产党人对法西斯作战，在新战争中，他们将团结法西斯分子以击溃共产党人。
    我们可以祝贺美国产联的书记有这样的前途，这种前途证实了我们所曾说过的话，即产生各种各样的南斯、各种各样的华尔锡及各种各样的加莱的美国外交政策，是要团结法西斯分子，而且这个团结已经发生了，例如在西德，在那里，美国与英国在法国的参与下为了击溃共产党人，正在组织西德军队，并任命法西斯将军们统率这些军队。
    某些国家的整个外交政策归根结底就是这样，而我们则告诫它们不要这样作。我们深信：为了联合国的荣誉与尊严，这个组织应该大声疾呼反对厌恶人类的意向、趋势、计划、愿望以及这一类的打算。
    斯宾德企图诽谤苏联的外交政策显示了他的无知以及撒谎的习惯
    斯宾德想要诽谤苏联外交政策，在他的演说中提到一九四七年举行的莫斯科四国外长会议，他说：这次会议已经表明苏联是在避免和美、英、法三国外长达成协定的可能性。这是纯粹的杜撰。这种杜撰不是显示斯宾德对于该次会议文件完全无知，就是显示他有根深蒂固的撒谎的习惯。但是，我认为这一次却是两者都具备。那么一九四七年莫斯科外长会议的实际情况是怎样呢？我认为，而且这是可以用文件来说明的，在这次会议上，关于德国问题的许多重要规定与决定都达成了协议。例如，通过了关于需要采取各种准备措施以建立德国临时中央政府的决定，同时非常详细地确定了这一未来德国中央政府的权力。关于政治统一、经济统一、财政统一和司法统一各方面，临时中央政府与各州政府间权力的划分也获致了协议。那时并承认未来中央政府有权实施下列措施：管制食粮供应、分配稀有的粮食和原料、制定工业计划、管制劳动条件、工资、物价及其他具有全德意义的重大问题；关于德国肃清军国主义和肃清纳粹主义、关于取消军事企业及若干其他的问题也获致了协议。这一切都通过了，这一切都决定了。难道在这种情况下还能说由于苏联外交部长的抵制，那一次会议是一无所获吗？很明显，这话是既无知又狂妄的了。
    另一方面，斯宾德对下述事实却一字不提，即在一九四七年莫斯科会议后，虽然在若干问题上已获致了协议，但是美国和英国政府却走上了分裂德国的道路，撇开了莫斯科会议所议定的义务，以及更重要的，撇开了这些义务所依据的波茨坦协定。
    那时候美国、英国和法国的政府便已经设法插手西德，利用西德来达到他们侵略的目的。
    我以为，上述事实绝对足以证明该澳大利亚发言人对事实的莽撞无稽了。他谈到我们在一九四八年和一九四九年时的政策，当时我们采取各种措施来避免新战争的威胁，但是他却歪曲事实。他在捷克斯洛伐克、奥地利和约、“柏林封锁”等问题上以极端虚伪和别有用心的观点来陈述事实。我的朋友捷克斯洛伐克代表西罗基先生已经部分地谈到这一点，提到了这些问题的某些地方。我来谈谈其他的问题。
    斯宾德重复着陈腐的捏造的谣言，这些谣言在当时就被驳斥了的。因此与斯宾德争论是没有用的，特别是他轻视了争辩的基本要求——即如实地陈述事实——与他争论就更没有用处。
    去年巴黎外长会议有关德国协议由于美英制造柏林危机未能实行
    我也必须谈谈在一九四九年五月——六月举行的巴黎外长会议，这次会议的结果充分驳斥了斯宾德在这里以不利于苏联的观点提出来的命题。诚然，谁不知道巴黎外长会议曾就有关德国和奥地利的若干重要问题获致了协议呢？不管有多大的困难，不管有多少分裂性的矛盾，但在一九四九年五月——六月间，四国外长终于就德国和奥地利的问题觅致了一个共同的纲领。这个纲领已经表明在公报里——这是近年来所不常有的事情。这个公报包含着若干关系重大的义务，而且是一致通过了的。这个公报并且指出了一致赞同的决定中的方针——一个很严肃的方针，并且概括地叙述了若干可能实行的措施。如果每一个人都信守这个一致通过的公报，这些措施应该是已经付诸实行了。不幸由于美英两国政府不努力解决柏林问题，这些措施竟未成为事实。当时在柏林，发生了显然是事先获得默许的铁路员工罢工，这个罢工造成了政治上和经济上的重大损害。而组织这个罢工的不是别人正是柏林西区的美英当局，它们还以金钱支持罢工。
    那时我们曾建议讨论草拟对德和约的问题。甚至更早一些，在一九四八年的巴黎会议上，我们就建议解决德国问题了。那时候，六个国家的代表在布拉葛马利亚（前阿根廷外长）的主持下担负起所谓调停人的任务——其中有些人今天也在座，他们一定还记得这回事情。那时候草拟了一个能够据以解决柏林问题的纲领。那时候，六个小国在布拉葛马利亚的主持下（我清清楚楚地记得，在这六国代表中，有在这里担任主席的叙利亚代表团团长埃尔——古里先生）拟订了这个纲领，而且我们接受了这个纲领。但是这六个国家那时候受到了美国和英国的压力，正象现在在选举与任命联合国秘书长这个问题上，美国为了力求非法延长旧秘书长任期而施行的压力一样。现在有许多人愿意当联合国秘书长，有许多人已被提名而且受到支持——例如拉丁美洲各国的代表和阿拉伯国家的代表，但是，因为他们受到美国方面阻止一切提名的压力，他们不能有所作为。也正是由于这种压力，在那时阻挠了取得协议。
    因此，如果我们要谈德国问题，那末苏联在一九四八年和一九四九年就已经尽最大限度前进了许多步，以求达成协议，当时，苏联是十分重视与其他国家，确切地讲，即所谓小国的合作的，可是毫无结果。但是，在这些事实面前，凡是庄重的人，能够说苏联代表团在这里一方面提出关于加强和平关系与合作的建议案，同时却在背地里执行一九二八年即二十二年前参加共产国际第六次代表大会的各国共产党组织所提出的要求么？二十二年前的事情，而且这居然会被引用作为苏联奉行背信弃义的政策的例证！
    法西斯势力时时刻刻在奥国抬头苏联合理建议竟被美英拒绝接受
    至于对奥和约，当时我们曾在若干问题上达成协议，但这个和约迄今仍悬而未决，这又是怎么回事呢？斯宾德应该知道：四国在象奥地利清除纳粹与解除军备这些重要问题上所达成的决定迄今尚未在奥国付诸实行。
    一直到现在，当年活跃的法西斯希特勒部下仍然在奥地利，在奥地利国家机关里高据要津。各种亲法西斯分子的组织和团体日益活跃。现在正在奥地利西区大力进行重新军事北的各种措施就是事实：奥地利的军队正在恢复，军用机场、军火库和试验场正在建筑。同时，关于奥地利管制机构的协议和一九四六年盟国对奥委员会关于奥地利国家机关内清除纳粹的决定都没有履行。盟国委员会关于禁止奥地利的一切军事活动的决定也没有履行，这一切都是由于美英军事占领当局显然的默许所致。这就是为什么当今年九月对奥和约四强外长助理会议复会时苏联副外长提出建议，要求把奥政府必须采取坚决有力的措施来反对法西斯主义这一点列入对奥和约中的原故，这种法西斯势力不仅一天天而且时时刻刻都在奥地利抬头。这就要求：对奥和约必须决定其内政外交政策方面的全部活动纲领，即是设法保证奥地利政府没有可能并不能容许恢复由希特勒“德奥合并”所产生的制度的纲领，这个建议也被拒绝，不予接受。很显然，这些奥地利权力机关的亲法西斯分子的活动便是以这种方式受着保护的，这些活动不愿理会具有伟大政治意义的关于奥地利的四强决定。而且另外一个应该指出的重要情况是：美、英、法三国统治阶级一方面不惜一切代价为缔结对奥和约而努力，同时却不履行前已缔结的条约所规定的要求；对意和约内关于的里雅斯特自由区的规定至今还没有履行。例如，自那时到现在虽然已经三年，但是安全理事会至今还没有任命总督，这一问题正与目前的秘书长问题的情形相同，目前的秘书长在他无法获得安全理事会支持以后就应该被认为是前任秘书长了。三年以来，不管苏联代表团提出了什么人来充当的里雅斯特自由区总督的候选人，但全都被听从美国指挥的大多数所阻挠了。
    即使我们推荐的恰恰是这个集团的代表们所提名的候选人，例如推荐英国提出的候选人，但连这些候选人也被拒绝了。
    但是，既然没有任命总督，那末，便没有可能将法规付诸实施，也没有可能来履行对意和约中的要求，例如规定英美军队撤出的里雅斯特等。
    这就是关于的里雅斯特一案所发生的情况；这就是德国人所谓“症结所在”。
    但是，假若关于的里雅斯特的条约不予履行，那末什么东西能保证履行对奥和约呢？假若由于没有履行对意和约而使的里雅斯特现在实际上变成了美英军事基地，那末什么东西能保证奥地利不变成象所谓的里雅斯特自由区一样的基地呢？绝对没有什么保证的！因此，很自然的，在九月伦敦四国外长助理会议上苏联代表又提出下列问题：即首先需要履行关于的里雅斯特自由区的条约，需要撤退该地的军队，从而证明条约不仅仅是签字而已，而且是付诸实施的。否则签订任何新条约都没有意义。
    假若斯宾德有勇气在这里以检察官似的口吻发表演说控诉苏联的话，他便应该知道这一事实。他明明是知道的；可是在这种情况下，假若他知道这一点却偏要这样子说话，那末，这就不是无知而是狂妄了。
    在巴黎四国外长会议上我们已建议讨论对日和约的问题，然而这却遭到如小说中所说的“冷淡的沉默”。这就是关于这些问题的事实，然而斯宾德和许多其他的人，包括杨格和奥斯汀，却竟利用这些问题为借口，硬说苏联没有履行其对于奥地利和德国的义务。但是倒底是谁没有履行义务呢？你们这些可敬的绅士们有什么权利来任意说这种话呢？没有任何权利的。
    美英反对苏联禁止原子武器建议而图管制原子能限制其和平用途
    美国、英国与美英集团若干其他国家的代表们曾以敌意对待，我甚至可以说，剑拔弩张地起来反对我们声明中专门论述禁止原子武器与设立监督遵行这项禁令的国际管制的建议的那一部分。
    他们反对我们关于这个问题的建议，同时把我们要求联合国大会宣布无条件禁止原子武器与建立严格国际管制（如我们声明的第二段所说）的建议煞费苦心地敷衍过去。他们规避回答这个问题，即：要求宣布毁灭原子武器的决心，当时他们当然预见到有关履行这个声明的计划及其他措施的讨论必然会成为原子能委员会或联合国某些其他机构研究的主题的。
    奥斯汀提到我们声明的第二段时仅仅说道，美国的国际管制计划，按他的说法，可以确保有效的强制保证。
    我很明白，我们将来还得讨论这个问题，所以现在不必详细去说。我现在只说一说主要与最重大的几点，以便确定这件事目前的情形。
    奥斯汀所说关于有效保证的话，我们是决不能接受的，因为我们都十分明白，一九四五年艾奇逊、巴鲁区、李连塞尔委员会所发明的这个臭名远扬的计划究竟是什么东西。我们知道，这个计划所策划的是什么样的保证。我们知道，这个计划的主要的特具的规定是把一切原子资源、一切原子物资的加工企业、一切有关的企业、以及各种主要关键性的工业部门——冶金、化学与其他许多工业——把所有这些以及科学研究工作统统转归这个所谓国际管制机构的充分掌握，为其所有。的的确确，根据这个计划，只有所谓“安全”数量的原子能与所谓次等重要性的企业才由个别生产原子能的国家支配。
    但是，必须指出，关于什么是“安全的”与什么是“危险的”定义，恰恰又是由同一个国际管制机构负责下界说。
    这个国际管制机构有权任意限制某一国家可用于和平目的的原子能的数量，因为只有签订适当的协定后，原子能才能被用在和平目的方面。
    因此，假如一个国家获得原子能，它本国也是不能处理这种原子能的——即便要用于和平目的而且只用于和平目的——而只是分给它，可以用于它的目的上的一定的数量。显然，这个国际管制机构成了管理与分配这种指定用于和平目的的原子能的全权机关。
    每一个多少有点学识的政治领袖、政治家或者经济学家都不难猜出这是什么意思。这是很容易猜出的，这就是意味着要彻底取消各国独立处理用于和平目的的原子能的主权。
    我唤起大家注意这个事实，即：依照这个美国计划，各国或多或少的原子能资源要来照比例用于全世界。因此，假如说苏联需要一百个单位的原子能作为和平建设之用，而依照按比例用于全世界的原则，苏联若不能有一百个单位而只能有五十个单位的话，那末它就只能得到五十个单位，而另五十个单位它便因此没有权利使用。
    这样，当它需要原子能作为最有力的动源以便发展它的工业时，它却必须减缩它的工业。
    这样，这对于那些缺乏动能而原子能在其经济的发展中将起决定性作用的国家，的确是特别重要的。同时这对于那些原子能可以在其经济与工业的发展与进步中起着非常重要作用的国家也是重要的，因为一旦原子能的定量不能与这个原子能国际管制机构所确定的比例相符时，原子能的定量就要予以削减。
    这就是这个计划的意义。这就是说，国际管制机关在行使这项原则时，可以人为地限制所有使用原子能的国民经济的发展。每个人都很清楚，这样就不能不极为不利地影响一个国家的全体生活与人民的福利。
    这件事实际上是可以导致这种结果的，关于这一点，我们清楚地可以从以佛兰克教授为首的美国社会政治后果委员会的报告中看出。这个报告是一九四六年五月一日在原子科学家公报里发表的。
    这个报告直接承认：以规定这样的定量或所谓配给的方法来限制原料与铀矿是会有缺点的，正如这个报告所说——我现在引用的是这个报告——它将会妨碍发展原子能用于和平用途。
    如果连这样权威的委员会在它致陆军部长的正式报告中也说，通过这样一种开发和配给的办法会妨碍发展原子能用于和平用途的话，那末，关心他们国民经济的发展、真心诚意地不想把原子能用来制造原子弹，而是想为全世界的文化和整个世界文明的利益而用于建设为人民造福的和平新经济的人们怎么能够接受这种情况呢？
    但是美国所热中的却正是这个计划，它完全不顾到这个计划会致一个国家的和平经济的发展于死命。即使这个计划没有其他的缺点而仅有这个唯一的缺点，我们能不能同意它呢？何况它还有着其他的缺点，而且这些缺点并不是不严重的。
    美国的国际管制计划的真正目的是要实现其垄断资本的世界霸权
    那末这个美国的所谓国际管制计划的目的是什么呢？
    答复这个问题并不困难。这个计划是为利用原子能仅供军事用途的任务而服务的，这种军事用途与联合国组织的目的和任务毫无相同之处，因为这个计划的目的是要实现美国垄断资本在全世界的霸权。
    美国的所谓国际管制计划，是要保证美国的垄断资本在国际管制机关中具有最大程度的势力，实际上是要使这个机关成为这些垄断资本的工具，成为它们政策的工具。但是主权国家，构成每一国家独立的支柱的国家主权，严重地阻碍了他们政策的实现。
    在我看来，这就是为什么美国计划的支持者在以前的各届大会上以及在本届大会上大事攻击国家主权的原则并不是一件偶然的事情。
    他们攻击这一点，说这是中世纪的观念，是中世纪的残余。
    实际上，主权原则是保证国家在政治和经济上独立的原则。
    有人告诉我们说，这将是一个国际机关，它将有相应的管制机构。但我们知道巴鲁区——这个计划的倡导人——关于这一点说过什么话，他说首先这个机构将根据“资格”的原则建立。某人有没有资格在这个机构内工作，究竟由谁来决定呢？还不是那些在那里控制着多数的人吗？
    此外，选择参加这个国际机构的人员时，将“尽可能”根据国际代表制的原则。仅仅是“尽可能”而已！还有人，特别是英国代表杨格，在会上告诉我们背离一点——用他的话来说——“主权的传统观念”是有必要的。他责备我们，硬说我们反对任何不符合依照传统观念而严格实行国家主权的协定。这是不符合事实的。如果人们翻阅一下去年大会会议的详细记录，他就会确信苏联代表团已在这个问题上作过非常明确的声明，就是说任何一项国际协定——这也是国际法的原则——不可避免地必然意味着对于其他国家主权的某些限制。但是问题完全不在于这个举世公认的国际法的规定——这是无可争论的；问题是这种限制可以到达什么地步，在主权上这种限制可以到达什么地步，限制主权应以什么为限度？应该明确的是，人们可以争论各种不同的限度，但是对于真正了解主权的意义，和承认现存的国际法原则的人们来说，不成问题地决不可能把一国的主权到限制该国主权都没有了的地步，换句话说，这种限制主权就会把主权减到等于零的地步。
    而拥护美国的所谓国际原子能管制计划的人们所要达到的就正是这种地步。我们不能同意这样的计划。
    六国提案对于禁止原子武器一点只是言辞上卖关子以便随时曲解
    我们的提案是从必须无条件地禁止原子武器，并成立严格的国际管制来监督执行这种禁令出发的。
    奥斯汀曾宣称美国政府愿考虑在这方面的任何计划，但是不愿考虑空话。这一点当然是正确的。谁愿意考虑空话呢？然而我必须说，奥斯汀曾大胆地那样说过。假如他指的是苏联代表团的建议，那么他就必须费尽心机去证明这些建议都真正是些“空话”。至今为止，没有人能够这样做，没有人曾经这样做过；我想将来也没有人会这样做。没有人做到了这一点，我想将来也没有人做得到。
    然而，不管我们怎样看这件事，美国的国际管制计划并未规定禁止原子弹，这是很明显的。在我们当前的六国提案当中，这一点也很明白地表现了出来。请看一下论到这点的一段吧。那里面有没有一个字提到要“禁止”原子武器，有没有一个字提到要由联合国大会“呼吁”或者“要求”或者“宣告”或者“建议”——一句话，不管以什么形式——禁止原子武器呢？那里面只说到，每一个国家都必须承担起建立有效的国际管制的义务，以便有效地实行禁止原子武器。但是，为了要执行禁令，就必须正式提出禁令，然而六国提案对这点却一个字也没有提！
    那么，谁告诉我，那一个文件约束别人不能生产原子武器呢？换句话说也就是，到底那一个文件禁止原子武器的生产呢？假如我们回头研究一下我们在这里通过的许多决议，就可看到，这些决议只是力陈必须“在这方面制定各种措施”。可是请看吧，为要在这方面制定种种措施，一直工作三年多了，但是禁止生产或使用原子武器的办法至今还是无影无踪。
    由于还没有这样的禁令，要求建立国际管制的一切问题和一切建议实际上只能是空话。这些真的是空话。这个问题的来龙去脉到底怎样呢？让我们回忆一下吧，苏联是这样说的：为了要监督禁令的执行情况，首先就得确立对原子武器的禁令。首先是禁令，然后才谈得上管制。
    有人告诉我们说：禁止吗，我们愿意的，但是也许你们不同意建立管制，那么禁令就会变成一纸空文，有禁止而无管制是毫无意义的。又有人告诉我们说，必须两者同时进行。我们同意这种见解。但是我们刚刚要表示同意的时候，我们的对手又自食其言。他们说，这不成，无论如何要先建立管制。那么让我们率直地告诉你们吧，我们怀疑你们并不希望禁止原子武器，因为空谈禁止是不会有结果的，这是空话，是烟幕。光是说“建立有效的管制以便有效地禁止”，而同时不先说“禁止原子武器并建立管制以便这禁令能够生效”，这当然就意味着在言辞上卖关子，要提出一种模棱两可的规定，以便随时都可有根据加以毫无理由的解释，当要建立对某些东西的管制之时，这一点是特别重要的。
    如果实行管制是为了防止滥用，首先就必需指明什么叫做滥用。但是，支持美英的国际管制计划的美英代表们，你们的计划中没有这一点。在你们的计划中是找不到这一点的。
    你们在这里可以告诉我说：你们有什么理由要作这样的怀疑，我们只是认为这样对这件事更有好处而已。怀疑是有理由的，去年我指出了这些理由，今年我必须重述一下。
    美国关于国际管制的一切空论证明它不打算停止制造原子武器
    我记起一件很重要的文件，这就是一九四六年美国原子能委员会委员们的一封信——由艾奇逊、布许、康耐特、麦克洛埃和葛罗夫斯将军签署的一封信。写这封信的日期是一九四六年三月十七日。信里十分明白地说：即使在国际管制机构建立后，美国也不打算停止制造原子弹。这封信说：制定有关这类计划的详细建议还需要进一步的研究，需要巨大的技术才干和众多的人员。当然这一点要最高政策的主要决定来加以明确规定。这些决定之一将是美国将继续制造原子弹多长时期的问题。那封信里说：这个计划并不要求美国在这个计划提出之后和国际机构开始执行职务之后必须停止这种生产……。
    这是什么意思呢？这就是说：国际机构将开始执行职务。什么种类的机构呢？管制机构。
    但是建立管制是为了不制造原子弹。然而一九四六年三月十七日的信说，即使在这个管制机构已开始工作的时候，美国也无意停止原子弹的生产。
    在决定美国政策的领袖们看来，关于在原子能方面禁用原子武器的问题，事情就是这样。主张按照美国计划成立这种国际管制机构的人，即使在这个国际管制计划行将实施的时候，连想也没有想到要禁止原子武器；他们不认为他们必须禁用原子武器。据说：我们还得看一看——这还有待于参议院和众议院遵照美国宪法和美国的利益以及在外交政策、国际局势等等方面的一般考虑来决定。这就是明明白白的说：虽然这种正在建立中的管制禁止原子武器生产的国际管制机构行将工作，美国政府却毫无停止原子武器生产的意思。
    那末既然你们不想停止这种生产，为什么又要建立这种停止生产的管制呢？
    很清楚，关于这种国际管制的谈论都是空话，都是空论，都是掩饰某国不愿意真正禁止原子武器——这种人类最可怕的灾难——的烟幕。因此我们正是在这一点上坚持我们的主张。我们建议：禁止原子武器，同时建立严格的国际管制。
    美国代表团反对我们的建立在所谓定期监督基础上的国际管制计划。我不想详细谈论这一问题，我只要求各位代表先生们在讨论这问题时牢记我在十月二十三日上次演说中说过的话，那时我详细谈到我们在一九四七年六月十一日和九月五日的信中所提出的关于监督的建议。当时我们十分清楚地圆满地提出了关于组织监督的意见，我们认为这是解决这一问题的十分圆满的办法。并且这并不仅仅是我们的意见。
    国际科学界均表示拥护苏联建议各族人民要求原子能仅用于和平
    如果人们听一听英国的科学界与公众的权威代表的意见，就可以知道国际科学界对苏联关于监督的建议作怎样的评价。例如，英国全国和平委员会会长贝利写道：为了建立这种管制，西方必须放弃联合国组织内多数的建议，而采纳俄国人的建议，而且西方必须承认俄国反对“多数”的计划（即美国的计划）是合理的。
    英国原子科学家、英国原子科学家委员会秘书柏贺浦教授说：如果我们同意根据苏联出席联合国代表团所提出的建议进行谈判，就会有取得协议的广泛可能性。与广泛流行的意见相反，这些建议在协议将被实际遵守的条件下可以保证禁止原子武器和建立高度有效的管制。
    至于原子科学家们对于禁止原子武器问题的态度，这里有若干著名科学家的意见。
    著名的澳大利亚原子科学家奥立芬认为在任何情况下都无从为使用镨弹或氢弹辩解，他说，使用原子武器将构成道德上的罪行。如果把斯宾德在原子弹领域中的权威与奥立芬教授的权威相比，我一定完全宁愿说奥立芬教授是更有资格的原子物理学家和更公正更爱好和平的澳大利亚公民。
    我也愿意你们知道一下十二位著名原子科学家的意见。他们在哥伦比亚大学美国物理学会会议上说：我们认为没有一个国家有权利使用这种炸弹，不论其动机如何纯正。氢弹不是战争的武器，而是消灭整个民族的工具。
    使用它就是破坏一切道德标准，也是破坏基督教文明本身。这自然也适用于原子弹。
    但是，关于我们在原子问题上的立场，情况怎样呢？我想，至于那一方面正确以及将来可以实行什么建议，不能有两种意见。我想不是在这个或那个委员会里的表决，而是人民的表决将会解决这问题。历史会判明谁是正确的。并且，我有把握说，这种判断绝不会是赞同违反人民利益、违反各族人民要求的美国计划的，各族人民都要求阻止将原子能用于军事目的，并要求保证各族人民有充分的机会将原子能绝对用于和平目的。
    斯德哥尔摩宣言具有伟大的力量战争贩子们已遭到强有力的打击
    现在我来谈谈这里反对我们提案的其他意见。这里也有人反对我们所提五大国在一九五○——一九五一年期间裁减各该国的武装部队三分之一的建议，并且还猛烈攻击斯德哥尔摩宣言；他们百般污辱这项宣言，说它彻头彻尾是某种可怕的诡计和骗局。据说，在和平宣言上签名的人民都是无知无识的，他们受了经验丰富的宣传家和煽动家的欺骗走入歧途等等。他们显然是在幻想：他们利用这种批评至少可以稍微减少具有历史意义的斯德哥尔摩宣言在社会上、道义上和政治上的巨大意义。瑞典代表先生，却使你的确为斯德哥尔摩道歉，斯德哥尔摩总还是斯德哥尔摩。其实你不该道歉，这是值得骄傲的事情呀！
    但是，这个宣言的力量从何而来呢？因为它已成为亿万人民的事业，已成为被那些在这里开会的上层人士中和美英集团各国的统治阶层中的某些大人先生们以那样轻蔑的口吻提到的人民的事业，已成为拒绝充当炮灰、充当履行侵略计划的工具而亲自掌握了和平事业的千百万人民的事业。必须了解，对和平斗士无论怎样镇压，有如目前在美国所实施的由联邦调查局和所谓非美活动委员会把他们列为“危险人物”；无论怎么殴打和逮捕，有如其统治集团正在极力对付和平斗士的其他若干国家所实行的；无论怎样陷害，有如可敬的和半可敬的大人先生们在他们的公开演说中所作的，无论什么办法都一定制止不了正在为和平、为反对准备战争的反动势力而进行斗争的民主力量的增长和巩固。
    和平斗士在这里所遭到的某些代表的粗鲁攻击，表明了他们的力量目前是有多么巨大。某些代表在这委员会内所做的这种攻击，表明了斯德哥尔摩宣言使一切危害和平的阴谋家和战争贩子遭到了怎样强有力的打击。
    苏联不仅主张禁止使用原子武器亦主张五强缩减军备和武装部队
    现在我来谈裁减军备的问题。为了分散对须要废除原子弹的注意力，有人就发明了这样一种夸大之词，说什么：不是原子弹而是坦克，才是最可怖的武器。
    杨格先生和其他的人曾说过，只用坦克而不用原子武器就可以残酷地毁灭几百万人的生命。这当然是不错的。每一次世界大战都毁灭了几百万人的生命。每一次世界大战——第一次和第二次世界大战已说明这一点——总要用坦克和一切其他种类的致命武器夺去几千万人的生命。
    但是为什么要提到坦克呢？这是否可以解释为坦克在大规模屠杀人民方面具有和原子武器同样大的危险性呢？这样说来，这话的意思是不是可以理解为因此就不需要禁用原子武器呢？“六国”提案不提议采取决定至少宣布无条件禁止原子武器，岂不是不就是为了这种原因呢？
    顺便说一句，如果批评我们的建议的人觉得坦克正是这种危险的武器，那末他们为什么不提出禁用坦克的问题呢？为什么他们不把这一问题与禁止原子武器问题一道提出来呢？为什么他们在他们的提案中关于要建立国际管制机构借以有效地执行禁止原子武器的命令而不说到坦克呢？为什么这样？在逻辑上是一点也讲不通的。
    我们以前说过，我们现在还说，并且建议：禁止原子武器以及用来大规模屠杀人民的一切种类的武器和一切基本种类的所谓大规模毁灭的武器，并且把这些武器和能够屠杀人群但不是大规模毁灭的武器分别开来。
    必须了解这种分别。坦克能够毁灭一群人，但是坦克不是用来大规模毁灭人民的盲目的武器。原子武器是可怕的，因为它是盲目的武器，它不是以可见的目标为毁灭的对象，是以大部分以平民为毁灭的对象。
    但是我们说——请看看我们的建议——原子武器可是最怕的最残酷的武器；我们在这里不但反对原子武器，而且反对一切其他大规模毁灭人民的武器，正象我们去年和前年在这里讨论禁止原子武器问题时所做的一样。
    但是坦克的情形怎样呢？显然的，坦克是武器；当我们对五强说：“让我们在一九五○年——一九五一年缩减我们的军备和武装部队，作为第一步并随后采取其他减少武器的措施”时，我们所指的也有坦克。我们说的是一切种类的武器。但是这个建议没有被多数派接受。多数派拒绝接受这个建议，说这是办不到的，因为这将使各国处于不平等的地位。
    举例来说，奥斯汀曾在这里说过：按照这种比例来缩减西方的小规模的军队等于剥夺大西洋国家的很多现有防御力量。他说的是怎样的“西方的小规模的军队”呢？我们所说到的只是英、法、苏、中、美五强的军队。
    因此，这个建议与北大西洋集团所有其他的参加者无关。
    有人告诉我们说这是不可能的，因为据说这样就会破坏武装部队的均势。这是不可能的，因为那些军力较苏联——姑且这样说罢——薄弱的国家的军事潜力将因此受到打击。那么就让我们看看，例如北大西洋同盟中的主要国家美国的所谓军事潜力究竟是什么？
    苏联预算中军需支出在逐年减少美国军费较战前将增加达五十倍
    我们可以看看美国的军事预算。
    关于苏联代表团的立场，斯宾德曾作了某些曲解和诡辩。
    讲到预算时，我并未将苏联和美国的军事需要的预算加以比较。我过去这样了解现在也还是这样了解；由于苏联预算和美国预算的结构本身的特点，要在这一方面加以比较是很困难的。我讲的是另外一些事情。我将每个国家预算中的军费逐年比较——将苏联的分别比较，将美国的也分别比较。
    我的可敬的同事巴拉诺夫斯基已经在这里讲到美国的预算，他正确地指出，在杜鲁门任总统时期的军费，较之美国以前三十二任总统在职期间的整个军费还要大好几倍。但我要从另一方面来看这一问题。
    第一、关于苏联的预算。我说过而且我确认：在一九四○年我们用在军事需要上的支出占我们预算的百分之三十二．六，在一九四六年占百分之二十三．九，在一九四九年——百分之十九．二，在一九五○年——这一数字已是百分之十八．五。这种数字发表在我们报纸上。对于这可以有什么异议呢？
    但是斯宾德之流有异议。他们说，“第一、没有人知道苏联用于军事需要的支出是多少”，但是如果没有人知道，斯宾德怎么会知道呢？
    斯宾德说：“第二、这些支出是庞大的”。但是斯宾德既然承认没有人知道这一点，他怎么能这样断言呢？
    斯宾德说：“第三、……”。第三、他不再说了。他认为他说的已经够了。在这里，我想起了纳斯里丁的故事。他向邻居借了一口锅，但却没有归还。当邻居来索取时，他回答说：“第一、我没有拿你的锅，第二、我打破了你的锅，第三、即令锅被打破了，我也老早把锅还给你了”。现在，斯宾德——这位乳臭未干的澳大利亚的纳斯里丁丝毫不差地遵循这一逻辑。
    但是美国的军事潜力的情形如何呢？
    美国总统杜鲁门在为美国一九五○年度的预算辩护时一字不差地这样说：“这一预算中建议维持的武装部队是我国在和平时期中维持的最强大的武装部队”。这句话的意思是什么呢？它的意思是，在一九五○年，美国武装部队比美国历史上任何时期都强大。
    大家也都知道，在一九四九——五○年，美国拨款额达一百三十亿元以上，而在战前一九三八——一九三九年则为十亿元，超过战前拨款十二倍。美国计划在一九五○——一九五一预算年度中，花费五百亿美元左右，这有一九三八——一九三九年度的五十倍之多。
    但是美国一些著名的军事专家们自己如何估计美国武装部队的情况呢？
    我愿意宣读从有充分权威的军事专家的结论中节录的几句话。他们这样说：“在原子武器竞赛方面，美国几乎是一定居于领导地位”。这位专家说：“我们已经得到，或者已经有可能来得到新的原子武器、更轻的原子弹，比用于日本的威力更大，能够用之于战地或海上的部队、城市及工业设备集中地，而且具有同样效力。”
    一位专家说：“我们有数量和质量上的优势，由于我们优越的工业潜力，这种优势的轮廓日益明显。”
    第三个人说：“我们在原子弹方面握有霸权，同时在战略飞机方面也握有霸权。”
    第四个人说：“我们拥有把我们的轰炸机变为可怕的毁灭性工具所必要的工具、技术、装备、经验和武器。”
    第五个人指出：“我们的海军飞机是世界上最好的。在空军方面，我们在海军飞机上占着优势。美国海军是世界最大的海军。我们的造船潜力是任何其他国家无法比拟的”等等。
    接着又有这样的人，他说：我们可以说只有人数很少的武装部队，微不足道——奥斯汀就是这样说的，我们不能同意裁减西方的“少量”军队。奥斯汀说，这将意味着“把大西洋国家防御力量剥夺掉很多”。这些人们企图把美国的军事潜力描写成不能把它的武装部队裁减三分之一的样子。此外，斯宾德和他的同僚们宣称，另一方面，苏联有四百万陆军。那末，他们是知道苏联的陆军有多少的。既然如此，为什么他们还责备我们不供给关于我们武装部队的任何情报以及不报告我们陆军有多少呢？
    叙利亚代表埃尔——古里曾在这里发言，并提出下列问题：裁减军备意味着什么呢？他说，必须确定某一国家及其邻国为了安全利益所需要的某种最低数额，必须裁减所余的武装部队。
    假如对裁减军备的原则采取决定苏联愿意提出这方面的充分情报
    在这样情况下，请问用什么原则来确定为了保障例如苏联和美国边境安全所需的军队数量呢？边界的长度吗？领土吗？自然，如果边界线从九州岛经过被麦克阿瑟称为“不沉的航空母舰”的台湾划到菲律宾，如果美国的边界线是这样划的话，那么什么样的要求和提议都可以提得出的。然既说到军事潜力，就必须考虑到整个武装部队，而不仅仅是陆军而已，当然，为了这个缘故，需要相当的情报。杨格先生与斯宾德先生，这就是需要情报的地方——并非仅仅是从某个地方通过自己的时常丧失天良的谍报机关或者通过那些穿着在乡下人的羊皮短袄和毡靴，在若干工厂的后院中徘徊，企图在还没有大开的门窗（照贝文先生的话）后面窥视的将军们那里取得的任何种类的情报，而是政府本身所供给的情报。如果你们愿意与我们在一张桌子上来会谈，从事研究依照我们所愿同意的原则来真正裁减这些武装部队，我们总是愿意提供关于我国武装部队的情况的任何情报的。
    我们建议这种原则：裁减所有武装部队——空军、海军、陆军——三分之一。有人对我们说：“把情报给我们”。我们答道：“如果对这个裁减武装部队与军备的原则采取决定，那么，在关于其他大国的类似情报提出的同时，你们便可收到关于我国武装部队与军备的充分情报。”但是，当然，当你们说“把情报给我们，我们再来考虑裁减”时，我们便要问：“你们要这情报干什么？”我们有权利认为要求情报是别有用心。
    在回到军事潜力问题上时，我必须指出，因美国的军事力量而得意忘形的美国专家们，正在试图恫吓神经衰弱的人们，但他们同时又提出充分的材料，暴露了这里的某些代表的那种眼泪双流的说话，那种不自然的人为的装穷是毫无根据的。这些代表们提到：西方军队的军事潜力不充足，因此不能通过我们所提的在一九五○——一九五一年裁减武装部队三分之一的建议。
    美国正在进行着疯狂的军备竞赛在世界各地建立了许多军事基地
    美国从事疯狂的军备竞赛，在世界各地建立愈来愈多的美国基地，拨出几十亿几十亿美元的款项用于军事用途——这些全都是不言而喻的事实，说明美国统治集团的对外政治方针正在实行，并且正在全力实行。
    这里有一些事实。在一九四七年，美国与菲律宾缔结协定。根据这项协定，美国租借了二十多个基地，期限是九十九年。美国正在菲律宾各岛设防，正在建筑新的军事基地，例如在吕宋岛北部，在明答那峨及其他地方。
    在中国的蒋介石政权垮台，美国丧失了在中国的一些基地（青岛、昆明、成都、桂林及其他地方）之后，美国政府把它的武装部队的基地改设在台湾。而如所周知，台湾是中国领土中不可转让的部分，外国军队违反中国政府的意志和愿望并且并未得到中国政府的许可就驻在那里，这是大大地违犯了国际法的主要原则。在中国，这种合法的政府就是中华人民共和国中央人民政府，而不是其他。美国在冲绳岛上和爪哇的泗水保有军事基地。同样也必须说到：美国特别是在佛朗哥政府的协助下，在地中海建立基地的事情。佛朗哥政府让美国政府自由使用西班牙的飞机场、空军基地和海军的空军基地，这已是众所周知的事实了。同样的也必须说到：葡萄牙也有这种情形。
    也可以提一提世界其他部分的许多美国基地——在近东与中东、北大西洋与北极，这些地方目前特别吸引美国统治集团的注意。美国之所以特别关心，其内幕早在一九四七年就已经史巴兹将军泄露出来了，他当时是美国空军总司令；他发表下列的声明说：“在目前行动范围的限制下，飞越北极的飞行有了重要的战略意义。四引擎飞机自极北的基地起飞，飞过北极，就可以袭击位于另一半球的工业中心。”
    奥斯汀把东拉西凑的话作为证据歪曲了列宁关于正义战争的定义
    这就是美国霸权的思想、渴念、意图、愿望、希望、计划的方向。我想只有存心撒谎的人或无知之徒才会在这些事实前面还要说象我们刚才在这里听到的美国代表所说的话。在作结语时，我想谈一谈奥斯汀演说中专谈苏联政府对战争的态度的那一部分。
    各位都记得，他曾引用了一九四六年文学报上的某些话，引用一九二八年共产国际第六届代表大会所通过的决议以及其他。他力图证明，当西方国家裁减它们的军队，如他所说，甚至是大大裁减之时，——我们刚才看到了它们，特别是美国，是如何裁减军队的——苏联报纸却号召，奥斯汀所谓“爱战争、斗争与胜利”。
    奥斯汀是如此耽溺于想不惜一切代价把苏联描写为剽悍的黩武主义的国家，竟至于冒险说，在“苏维埃政权的主义”中，不可能找到“一点点憎恨战争的明白声明”。他援引了几句东拉西扯凑在一起的毫不连贯的话作为证据，他说，因此，我们不可能知道“苏联把什么认为和平，把什么认为战争”。
    当奥斯汀企图论述苏联对战争的态度时，他头脑中的绝望的混乱从他的这些话里显然看得出来。
    例如，竟然说苏联的政策是这样一种政策：人们无法知道它把什么认为战争，把什么认为和平。这种说法的根据是什么呢？文学报的一篇文章。可是，即使文学报曾说过在这里所提到的那些话，但它既不是苏联政府的机关报，尤其不是外交部的机关报，而且，我愿意说明，文学报并不曾说过那些话。
    例如，有人提起一九二八年所举行的共产国际第六届代表大会。但一般人都知道：对于共产党代表大会所作决定，苏联政府并无责任，苏联政府知道怎样把属于党派性质的问题，共产主义运动的问题，和有关政策和国家的问题以及属于苏联政府权限之内的问题，彼此分开的。关于这一点，奥斯汀能不能费神举一些比较近一点的例子呢？因为他所提的文学报是四年以前的，他所提的共产国际第六次代表大会是二十二年以前的事情了。怎么能够用那种陈旧的材料来证实或是否认任何有关现时的事情呢？
    再说，一九四八年十月十二日政治委员会在这一个大厅里开会的时候，奥斯汀也是一字不差地照样引述了文学报这一段话和共产国际第六次代表大会的决议。他当时所引述的也是一九四六年的这份文学报和一九二八年的这个共产国际第六次代表大会。但文学报和六次代表大会决议里真正说了些什么呢？奥斯汀并不懂得其政治意义而机械地引述下来的那些话的真正含义是什么呢？
    伟大的俄罗斯作家果戈里作品中有一位名叫彼特鲁什卡的人物，他喜欢读书，特别喜欢读日历。但他所感觉兴趣的却不过是读书这一动作本身罢了。他认得字母，他能把字母拼成音节，也会把各音节念成字，但是各个字的意义呢？各个字的意义他就莫名其妙了。当读文件的时候，最要紧的是懂得你所念的是什么意思，并不是重复它的词句就可了事。甚至鹦鹉也能学舌，可是它却不懂它所重复的话的意义。
    首先我愿提请注意一个事实，即奥斯汀并不限于引用上述的两段话。他还援引了斯大林大元帅一九四六年二月九日在莫斯科选民大会上所发表的演说，并从演说中得出与原来讲词完全不符的结论。奥斯汀怎样居然能够带着一些不负责任的人为他准备的文件，甚至还没有校对这个文件的原文便走上国际讲坛来，这倒是真正是令人吃惊的。
    奥斯汀企图提出战争和苏联对战争之态度的原则性问题。他丝毫没有读一下联共党史简明教程，在这本书里以最通俗的方式说明了列宁关于正义的战争和非正义的战争的理论。
    在谈这一理论时，奥斯汀仅仅说：“按照列宁说来，正义的战争就是为了把人民从资本主义奴役下解放出来而进行的战争，”又说，“那就是扩张苏维埃国家的利益。”但是列宁却是没有说过象“那就是”这句话的。此外，奥斯汀还歪曲了列宁对正义战争的定义。根据列宁的话，正义的战争乃是一种“非侵略性的战争，解放战争，其目的或者是保卫人民不受外来攻击和奴役他们的企图，或者是将人民从资本主义奴役下解放出来，最后，或者是将殖民地和保护国从帝国主义者的压迫下解放出来。”这才是按照列宁所说的“正义的战争”。
    列宁关于正义与侵略战争的定义只有无知的人才不了解这种分类
    殖民地国家争取从附属于帝国主义者与受帝国主义者奴役的状态下解放出来的战争也是正义的战争。根据列宁的遗言，如果这些附属的殖民地国家中的被压迫人民进行战争来反对帝国主义奴役，这是正义的战争；如果他们进行战争来反对进攻他们国家与试图奴役他们国家的侵略者，这是正义的战争；如果进行战争是为了从奴役——包括帝国主义奴役——状态下解放出来，这也是正义的战争。
    在美国历史中，曾经有过这类的战争。例如：民主与爱好自由的北美为了反对占有奴隶的南美而进行的战争。这是一个解放战争，这是一个正义的战争。我想，美国的代表在这一点上也会同意我的意见的。
    我还可以举出另外一个关于解放战争的例子。这就是反对希特勒侵略者的战争。在一九四一年十一月六日，正当希特勒匪徒逼近莫斯科大门的时候，苏联武装部队的总司令和苏联部长会议主席斯大林大元帅对莫斯科劳动者代表苏维埃发表演说，讲述希特勒帝国主义者必然崩溃和当时为了抗击德国法西斯帝国主义而结成的英苏美合作的重大意义。当时斯大林在他的讲演里说：
    “列宁把战争分为两类：掠夺的、因而也就是非正义的战争，解放的、因而也就是正义的战争。
    “德国人现在正在进行掠夺的战争，非正义的战争；其目的在于攫取他国领土，征服他国人民。这就是为什么所有诚实的人民一定要起而反对德国侵略者、把他们视为敌人的原因。
    “与希特勒德国相反，苏联及其盟国正在进行解放的战争，正义的战争；其目的在把被奴役的欧洲和苏联人民从希特勒的残暴统治下解放出来。这就是为什么一切诚实的人民必定支持苏联、英国和其他盟国的军队，把他们视为解放军的原因。”
    这就是解放战争，正义的战争！
    我们赞成这种战争，而且我们认为：当问题涉及这类战争的时候，就绝不可以渲染它的恐怖来吓唬人民。只有侵略者的同谋犯，只有人民的叛徒才能这样作。爱国者在这种战争中不畏惧任何的牺牲与流血，因为这是保卫祖国反对外国侵略者的事情。在这种时候，如果制造惊慌、假仁假义及非战主义的分子出头露面，试图用“战争的恐怖”来吓唬人民，我们就要说：不许这样，非战主义是敌人的帮凶。斯大林在一九三○年写给高尔基的而为奥斯汀在这里厚颜无耻地歪曲其意义的一封重要的有原则性的信件，其中所谈的正是这个意思。
    斯大林当时写道：“战争问题不能与政治问题分离开来，战争是政治的表现方式”。斯大林在写给高尔基的信里说：“书店里有大批描写战争‘恐怖’灌输厌战（不只是帝国主义战争而且包括其他各种战争）情绪的小说，这些资产阶级的非战主义的故事是没有多大价值的。”
    “我们反对帝国主义战争，因为它是反革命的战争。但是我们拥护反对帝国主义的战争，解放战争，革命战争；尽管象大家知道的，这类战争不但免不了，而且甚至是充满着‘流血恐怖’的。”
    这些便是我们的导师在一九三九年致高尔基的信里所说的崇高的话。而奥斯汀先生却歪曲了这一切，说它是呼吁战争，引用它作为违反关于禁止战争宣传的决议的例子。但是，难道我们禁止自卫的战争、正义的战争，禁止反对入寇者、反对侵略者的战争吗？不，我们的宪章鼓励我们进行这样的斗争。宪章是禁止掠夺的、侵略的战争！不管自卫战争会多么艰苦，只要它是反抗侵略者的战争、反抗入寇者的战争，只要它是伟大的列宁过去曾经说过，而伟大的斯大林现在所说的正义战争，我们这个组织就以来保护它——宪章。
    斯大林大元帅在一九三○年致高尔基的信中包含着同样的列宁主义原则，说明了如帝国主义战争那样的侵略战争的非正义性，十分明白地确定了我们对战争的态度。只有无知无识的人才不能了解正义和非正义战争的分界线，假如连战争与和平的分界线也分不清楚的话，那就更是无知无识了。
    奥斯汀的说法完全没有事实根据粗暴地歪曲了斯大林演说的真义
    奥斯汀还有更甚的说法。他声言，苏联政权认为战争不是由法西斯国家发动，而是因西方国家的经济制度而造成，苏联这种见解到一九四六年二月便明显地表露出来了。为了证明这一点，他引用斯大林在一九四六年二月的演说中的几段，那里面说，第二次世界大战的爆发，是世界经济和政治力量在今日的垄断资本主义的基础上发展的必然结果。
    奥斯汀还声言——用他的话来讲——按苏维埃的语言发动战争的垄断资本家正是那些战时协助苏联进行反德国侵略战争的国家。因此，这个二月九日的发言恰正意味着战时合作政策的终止。
    这种说法是奇怪的，先生们！这种说法是奇怪的，因为它空前粗暴地歪曲了二月九日演说的真义。要完全明白这一点，你们只要亲自读一下演说词便足够了，甚至无须我来帮助。在上述的演说中，象奥斯汀那样的推论绝对找不到一点根据，没有一丝一毫事实和奥斯汀所说的相象，甚至找不出丝毫这种暗示。此外，在二月九日的演说中，斯大林大元帅明显地指出，反对轴心国家的第二次世界大战和第一次世界大战不同，这次大战从一开始就具有反法西斯战争的性质，其任务之一就是恢复民主自由。在二月九日这篇演说里，斯大林大元帅是这样说的：“苏联之参加反轴心国家的战争只有增强——而也的确增强了——第二次世界大战的反法西斯和解放的性质。”这意思就是说，我们当时和美国、英国和其他目前出席这会议的国家共同进行了反法西斯侵略者的解放战争。
    奥斯汀对下列事实却一字不提，即，斯大林正是在他这篇光辉的演说中说，“正是在这个基础上（在反抗德国侵略者的解放战争的基础上——维辛斯基注），苏联、美国、英国和其他爱好自由的国家的反法西斯联盟产生了，而且后来在击败轴心国家的军队中起了决定的作用”。难道这还不足以了解二月九日所说的话，明了战争的正义属于那一边，认识奥斯汀如何蛮横地歪曲事实硬说二月九日的演说是苏联转而破坏其与别的国家的友好关系，与那些在大战期间曾与苏联有过友好关系的国家的友好关系吗？奥斯汀的话从那里产生的呢？他的话从那里引来的？这是蛮横地、居心诽谤地歪曲事实。
    我现在就我们关于缔结五强和平公约的提案讲几句话。从本质上说，在这里，对宣言中这一项的实质，除去一个反对意见外，别无其他反对意见，唯一的反对意见就是所谓我们既已有了联合国宪章，还需要这样的公约干什么呢？为什么要重复呢？但是，让我问一问，那末为什么要通过重复宪章若干条款的六国提案，或者说玻利维亚提案呢？为什么呢？
    然而，能否容许以这样态度来讲道理，说因为有了宪章，那末其他的一切便都是多余的呢？将宪章的某些原则提出来赋以今日政治的实际形式，并且在这一基础上组织我们的联合的力量，俾使宪章中所宣布的原则得以实施，难道不必要吗？即令在宪章实行得不好，或者被违反了的时候，宪章当然还是宪章。但是，这一点却并不排除根据宪章的原则性条款采取决定之必要，在目前政治情势下通过这些决定唯有加强宪章中所表示的那些原则的重要意义。
    否则，便需要整个地反对一切以宪章为基础的实际行动了，或者说有必要开始实行与宪章背道而驰的实际行动了，因为这种行动才恰恰是宪章中所没有的。然而，这却是新奇的建议。
    苏联建议缔结五强公约维护和平因为它是保证各国安全重要措施
    我们正建议缔结一项公约——五强公约。为什么是五强呢？因为这五国负有特殊的责任，不是主要的责任，也不仅仅是一般的责任（主要责任是由安理会担负，维持和平的一般责任由我们大家共同担负），因为这五国为了十分可以理解的理由，握有和平与战争的大权。发动世界战争要取决于它们，加强国际和平也取决于它们，因为它们手中握有战争及和平的最大的手段。这是事实，我们必须估计到这个事实。
    尼加拉瓜因为没有象美国那样的空军和海军就有了过失吗？不，它没有过失。但尼加拉瓜如果参加实施我们加强和平的共同措施就能够对一般的加强和平的事业贡献它的一份力量。在二次世界大战期间各小国就是这样对战争贡献出它的一份力量。在这个问题上也是如此。如果真的有和平愿望的话，那么为什么我们大家不接受缔结这种公约的建议呢？我们有这样的愿望。我们认为这种公约是有用的。我们知道，即使从这里所谈论的加强信任的观点来看，这种公约也会有异常巨大的社会及政治意义。
    真的，每一个老百姓将会说：“是的，你看，不管他们意见怎样不同，他们已一致同意共同维持和平！这就是说，我们能够在和平之中为了获得我们的面包而工作，我们能够在和平之中睡眠，我们能够在和平中抚育我们的儿童，知道他们不会成为原子弹的牺牲品。”难道这不是有巨大的政治意义吗？毫无疑问，是有的。
    这就是为什么苏联代表团全力拥护它所提出的关于缔结五强公约以加强和平的建议的原因，因为它认为这种公约是维持和平、消除新战争威胁及保证各国安全的最重要措施之一。
