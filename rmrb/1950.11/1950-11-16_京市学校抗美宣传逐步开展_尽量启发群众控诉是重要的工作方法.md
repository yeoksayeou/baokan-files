　　Anti-American Propaganda Progressively Unfolds in Beijing Schools
    Striving to Inspire the Masses to Accuse is an Important Working Method
    [Our Newspaper] Anti-American and Aid-Korea propaganda work is gradually unfolding in Beijing's universities and middle schools. Under the unified leadership of the Anti-Aggression Committee's Peking University branch, faculty and students at Peking University have been conducting systematic current affairs studies, discussing the thinking of city residents, and organizing school-wide groups for cartoons, plays, dance, wall newspapers, photography, singing, quick reports, and other activities to actively prepare propaganda materials. Many professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants have also participated in the work. Under the convocation of Dean Ma Dayou, the Engineering College has formed a professors' propaganda team, with Professor Hu Yun as the captain, to go out and carry out propaganda work together with students. The Electrical Engineering Department's trade union group wrote a letter of challenge to other groups, driving the entire trade union and giving the students a lot of encouragement. Professors from various departments of the Faculty of Arts, convened by Mr. Zheng Tianting and Mr. Yang Hui, not only expressed their willingness to actively participate in various propaganda activities, but also decided to study the reactionary nature of American bourgeois literature and art, analyze the characteristics of the Volunteer Army from a historical perspective, and translate a large number of foreign materials.

    The Hui Nationality College set off for the second time on the 12th to conduct propaganda in the areas where Hui compatriots live, such as Niujie inside Guang'anmen and Baoguosi, and were warmly welcomed. On the afternoon of the 15th, the History, Chinese, and Foreign Languages Departments of Fu Jen Catholic University conducted street propaganda in the inner four districts. Other departments are also actively preparing and will soon be dispatched in large numbers. Yu Ying Middle School conducted street propaganda in the first district on the 11th and 12th. The Women's Affiliated Middle School of Beijing Normal University dispatched four large teams on the 14th, and also set up two propaganda stations near the school, posting huge posters and cartoons, going there regularly to conduct propaganda, and answering difficult questions for the masses. Municipal No. 3 Middle School has conducted propaganda in the countryside. The Women's No. 1 Middle School is also actively preparing and is scheduled to set off on Saturday.

    The class chairmen of various classes of Beijing Normal University held a meeting on the 13th to summarize the experiences of the previous day's propaganda. The correspondence group of the Hui Nationality College also summarized their two days of propaganda. Generally speaking, they have made relatively full preparations. The propagandists are very active. The propaganda methods pay attention to suiting the tone of the masses and diversification, which has increased the propaganda effect. Entertainment programs, lectures, and accusations are appropriately matched, which makes it seem less boring. The students of Beijing Normal University are able to create propaganda methods at any time. When conducting propaganda on Xuannei Street, they found that there were a lot of children, so they organized them, quickly taught them a song, and let them sing it, which was greatly welcomed by the masses present, especially the children's mothers. However, there are still some shortcomings, mainly: 1. Insufficient understanding of the masses' thinking, not enough ideological problems of the masses have been solved, and some of the questions raised by the masses cannot be well explained; 2. The language and content are not popular enough; 3. The actors' expressions have not fully conformed to the content of the plot, or one aspect has been emphasized during oral propaganda, resulting in some side effects. In addition, there are also phenomena of insufficient organization and insufficient preparation. Beijing Normal University has put forward several points to pay attention to in the future. In addition to making the language as popular as possible and the propagandists imbuing their own emotions to express joy, anger, sorrow and joy, they must also try to inspire the masses to make accusations.

　　京市学校抗美宣传逐步开展
    尽量启发群众控诉是重要的工作方法
    【本报讯】京市大中学校抗美援朝宣传工作正在逐步展开。北大师生在反侵略委员会北大分会统一领导下，进行了系统的时事学习；针对市民思想进行了讨论；组织全校性漫画、剧艺、舞蹈、壁报、摄影、歌咏、快报等组，积极准备宣传材料。许多教授和讲师、助教，也都参加了工作。工学院在马大猷院长召集下已组成教授宣传队，推胡筠教授为队长，和同学一块出去宣传。电机系工会小组并写挑战书向各小组挑战，带动了整个工会，也给了同学们不少鼓舞。文学院各系科先生由郑天挺、杨晦先生召开座谈会，除表示要积极参加各种宣传，并决定分头研究美国资产阶级文艺的反动性，从历史上分析志愿军的特点和大量翻译外国资料。
    回民学院十二日第二次出发，到广安门内牛街和报国寺回族同胞住的地方去宣传，受到热烈欢迎。辅仁大学历史、中文、外文三系，在十五日下午到内四区作了街头宣传。其他各系也在积极准备，即将大批出动。育英中学十一、十二两日到一区进行了街头宣传。师大女附中十四日出动了四个大队；并在学校邻近设置了两个宣传站，张贴巨幅大字报和漫画，定时前去宣传，并给群众解答疑难问题。市立三中曾下乡宣传。女一中也在积极准备，定星期六出动。
    师大各班班主席在十三日开会，总结了前一天宣传的经验。回民学院通讯组对他们两天来的宣传也作了总结。一般说来，都作了比较充分的准备。宣传员工作者很积极。宣传方式，注意了适合群众口吻和多样化，增加了宣传效果。文娱节目和讲演、控诉恰当地配合起来，显得不枯燥。师大同学能够随时创造宣传方法，在宣内大街宣传时，发现小孩特别多，便把他们组织起来，很快地教会他们一个歌，让他们唱，受到在场群众、特别是孩子们的母亲的很大欢迎。但还有一些缺点，主要的是：一、对群众思想情况了解不够，解决的群众思想问题还不够多，群众提出的问题有的不能很好地解释；二、言语和内容还不够通俗；三、演员表情没有能完全符合剧情内容，或口头宣传时强调了一个方面，发生了一些副作用。另外也还有组织不够健全，准备不够充分的现象。师大提出了今后要注意的几点，除言语要尽量大众化，宣传员要贯入自己感情，把喜怒哀乐表达出来外，还要尽量启发群众进行控诉。
