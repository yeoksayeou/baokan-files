Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 19th: Soviet representative Ehrenburg, in his speech at the Second World Peace Congress on the 18th, stated: A great burden has fallen on the shoulders of each of us. People have the right to disregard themselves, to disregard everything, and even to disregard danger. We are not thinking about our own fate now. We are responsible for all the children in the light and in the dark, for the children of London and Moscow, Paris and Beijing, for the children in the skyscrapers of New York, and for the children who are currently wandering in the ruins of Korea. We are responsible for all loved ones, for all places in the world, for all cities, and for all factories. People ask with frightened hearts: "War again? … Can we survive in such troubled times? Can we raise children when we are worried about when bombs will fall on their heads? Can we think about creating a rich human culture when the demon of war darkens human culture?"

War is not an earthquake, nor is it a poisonous wind; war is the behavior of people, and people can prevent war. The danger is great. Everyone understands this. We are gathered here not to engage in lofty discussions, nor to argue in debates. People expect us to make thoughtful statements, propose clear recommendations, and pass resolutions that are acceptable to everyone: we must prevent war. All men and all women, wherever they live, hold this hope.

Some say: War is inevitable because the world is divided into two worlds. Because the laws in Moscow are different from those in New York, because in some countries Communists have lost their legal status, while in other countries Communists are making laws. The President of the United States said in one of his speeches: "The United States and other nations inspired by the same ideals are repulsed by a system with different purposes and a different worldview. This system adheres to a false philosophy." Mr. Acheson recently recited President Truman's arbitrary words, saying: "Many aspects of this philosophical system, especially as practiced in the Soviet Union and some other countries, not only disgust us, but also raise fundamental questions about the concepts of good and evil." I would like to say, for the sake of argument, that from Mr. Truman's point of view, Marxism is a "false philosophy," and that the Soviet system is disgusting to Mr. Acheson. I will not talk about what I think of Mr. Truman's philosophy, nor will I talk about my attitude towards the ethics that determine Mr. Acheson's behavior. However, the superiority of a philosophical system or an economic system cannot be proven by war. Dropping a hundred bombs on a hundred universities in the Soviet Union will not prove that James's pragmatism is superior to historical materialism. War is not a debate of ideas, nor is it an argument.

War is the greatest disaster that affects all ethnic groups and their cultures. If Soviet ideas or Soviet books make some Americans unhappy, then they can try to defeat these ideas with ideas and refute these books with books. As for bombs, they are powerless in this regard.

Those in the United States who want to maintain their economy, their ideas, and their way of life are foolish if they rely on war. The evolution of the situation over the past forty years has shown that war accelerates social change. However, if war cannot protect the capitalist world from the influence of socialist ideas, then war is certainly not the road to socialism. People who strive for progress clearly recognize that a new world war will set humanity back and destroy the material foundations necessary for building a better society. No citizen who sincerely loves his future would agree to pay such a high price for the victory of his ideas. War is not the midwife of history; war is the "devil's factory" that destroys the essence of humanity. War is incompatible with our Soviet philosophy, our ethics, and our will. Because we have confidence in the future, and all the children in the world—not only the children of Moscow, but also the children of New York—are our hope, our friends, and our allies.

I believe that the American way of life distresses me no less than the Soviet way of life distresses Mr. Acheson. However, I advocate peace—not only peace with the America of Fast and Robeson, but also peace with the America of Truman and Acheson. I know that there are many people in the world who do not like socialism. I hope Truman and Acheson should also know that there are many people in the world who prefer socialism to capitalism. We live on the same planet. There is plenty of room here to accommodate people who support different social systems. They can reach an agreement: not to break down the door and break into the house simply because they hate the thoughts of the owner of the house, and not to throw stones at the neighbor's windows simply because the neighbor has different ideas, speaks different languages, and lives a different life.

"If you want peace—prepare for war." This dangerous motto of the most warlike writer in the most warlike country is now being recited by those who are preparing for war and want war. They are desperately trying to convince their compatriots that the more airplanes, bombs, and artillery shells there are in the world, the more peacefully children can sleep. Chekhov once said: If there is a rifle hanging on the wall in the first act of a play, then someone will fire it in the last act. War cannot be prevented by accumulating weapons. War can only be prevented by reducing and destroying armaments.

We all demand a halt to the accumulation of armaments, and I am sure we will achieve this goal. But this is not enough. Even if millions upon millions of bombs have been accumulated, it is still impossible to start a war if the hearts of millions of people have not been poisoned, because war requires soldiers. I am a writer, and I know the magic of words. I say this with pride and with pain. Words can help people become heroes, can call on people to complete solemn missions, can ignite love in people's hearts, but words can also turn people into beasts, anesthetize people, make people lose their conscience, and instigate people to do despicable things.

When Hitler led his army to attack peaceful countries, people asked: "How could honest citizens and loyal working people follow those bandits and murderers?" During the trials of Nazi villains, many people were surprised: Where did these malicious executioners come from? Where did these evil people who burned living people in the crematoria of Auschwitz come from? Where did Ilsa Koch, who made lampshades from human skin, crawl out of?"

People cannot help but recall Weimar and Heidelberg, the humility and sensitivity of ordinary Germans walking under the ancient linden trees, the harmless entertainment of ninepins—played by the great-grandfathers of the "Nazi SS"—and the embroidery of Ilsa Koch's grandmothers. Cruelty and bloodthirst are not innate. The worship of violence was not originally lurking in the blood of ordinary Germans. Contempt for the people of other races is not the mysterious nature of the residents of Weimar or Heidelberg. The idea of annexation, racial and national arrogance, barbarism, and immorality were all instilled into the hearts of ordinary Germans by the Nazis, Nazi newspapers, and Nazi schools.

Who wants to repeat the experienced horror? Should Warsaw see those executioners and arsonists again? Should Paris hear the advance of the occupying forces' iron hooves again? Should London hear the roar of enemy planes in the sky again, and hide children in the subway? Shouldn't Americans, who have always known war mainly from Hollywood movies, witness the flames of war, blood, and death on their own land?

Can we allow a new war to break out? Those who are preparing for a new war are not only cultivating bacilli that kill people's bodies, but they are also corrupting people's souls, desperately poisoning the hearts of millions of people. They are infecting people with the idea of national superiority, hatred of other ethnic groups, and the idea of mass slaughter. Is it permissible that we cannot sanction those people?

In the eyes of ordinary people, war is terror, is the blood of children, is the dull gaze of mothers who have lost their beloved sons, but in the eyes of some people, war is a savior. They do not hide their tricks; they sit around the table in full view, eating, drinking, and talking loudly.

The *U.S. News*, the mouthpiece of American financiers, wrote: "If peace is actually guaranteed, everything will be ruined." These people are afraid of peace, and they are relieved to see people's hearts becoming increasingly anxious. The "Afeida" stock exchange in Zurich is selling the stocks of American aviation companies to customers, calling them "war babies." Let us think of the children of Leningrad, the children of Coventry, and the children of Korea, and let us say: This kind of thing must be stopped.

The *Times Herald* published in Washington wrote: "We will send planes flying at an altitude of 40,000 feet, and we will supply those planes not only with bombs—atomic bombs, incendiary bombs, and germ bombs—but also with hydrogen bombs, so that they can go and kill babies in cradles, old people who are praying, and working people who are working hard."

I would never say that these kinds of demands are made by honest American people. It pains me that in that city named after a noble and great figure, executioners who slaughter children and slaughter people can live there, operate there, and openly instigate crime there. I cannot say that the remarks in those newspapers are made by some irresponsible people. I want to quote some remarks of those people, unfortunately, those people are all fully responsible people, that is, members of the US Congress:

"The time is coming when an enraged America will shower Russia with atomic bombs... The number of bombs dropped will be more than just one. It will be like a flood. We already have at least 250 atomic bombs and hundreds of ways to defeat Russia." —John Walsh, Representative from Indiana.

"We have 450 atomic bombs, maybe a little more. That is enough to drop 50 bombs on each major industrial city in Russia." —Senator Stennis of Mississippi.

"The United States will no longer wage war in the distant corners of the world, but must wage war in the heart of Communist Russia." —Senator Johnston of South Carolina.

"After the start of the future war, we must take Moscow and any other city in Russia within three weeks. Within the first three weeks, we must raze all Soviet military centers to the ground." —Representative Cannon of Missouri.

They can rebut again: the United States has many members of Congress. Not all of them are known for their wisdom and gentleness. Of course, I believe that members of the legislature should represent the people of a country. But if any of them prove to be criminals or mentally ill, then they should be removed from the highest authority. However, calls for wars of aggression do not only come from the mouths of congressmen; official representatives of the United States—ministers and deputy ministers—are also calling for war. Two months ago, US Secretary of the Navy Matthews suggested the following method of establishing peace to his compatriots: "We should force the realization of peaceful cooperation at any cost, even at the cost of launching a war... Although we will therefore get the title that is still unfamiliar to truly democratic countries—the initiator of a war of aggression."

Undersecretary of the Army Griffith said in the summer that he had already advised Mr. Truman to drop atomic bombs on the Soviet Union in 1947.

If the Soviet Minister of the Navy said: In order to force the United States to cooperate, we must declare war on the United States, he would undoubtedly be brought to trial. If the Deputy Minister of the Army of the Soviet Union suggested dropping bombs on the United States, he would undoubtedly be confined to a mental hospital.

There are also people in other countries who call for aggression, and there are also people who make speeches and write articles that are intent on arousing mass slaughter sentiments among the people. Especially in such a country, its government forbids friends of peace from meeting in Sheffield, but politely allows anyone who needs war to call on the people to carry out a new and terrible slaughter. It is in this country that that old philosopher Russell, once considered a humanist and pacifist, advocates launching a world war as soon as possible. It is in this country that a very respected Lord Trenchard praises the atomic bomb, which, according to him, can kill 10 to 20 million people per month.

The demand for war comes from the mouths of British people, which is particularly heartbreaking, because such demands are completely inconsistent with the British people's love for peace, because they show the ignorance of some British people, who have forgotten that their island will be the first victim of the war they are calling for.

The call for war even echoes in a country that clearly remembers the horrors of war—France. I understand this country and love it. I want to say that those who call for war in France, those who speak French and write in French, cannot be called French. Their past, like their present, shows that they are only translating non-French ideas into French. I have to recall a document signed by the politician Reynaud that shocked humanity, who at one time appointed the traitor Pétain as his deputy, and at the same time recall the poet Claudel, who at one time wrote passionate odes to praise this traitor.

I want to talk about the report of the "International European Issues Research Committee." In this report, the act of mass slaughter of people is praised. In order to slaughter 60 to 70 million people, this report suggests using atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, bacilli and poisons, destroying livestock and crops, asphyxiating gas, and other murderous means prohibited by international conventions. As far as I know, the compilers of this report have not been condemned and continue to engage in activities that are far from humane. The transition from words to action aroused the enthusiasm of some people. "Marseille France" newspaper wrote: "What is currently being done in Korea should be done in Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, East Germany, and the Baltic countries."

The atrocities being carried out in Korea are making those barbaric dreams come true. The war reports signed by General MacArthur are known for their cruelty, which even greatly surprised those who have experienced the horrors of Nazi aggression. The "Le Monde," the mouthpiece of French industry and commerce, published General MacArthur's headquarters' war report of October 14, pointing out that the wording of this war report "is sometimes shocking." The following is an excerpt from this truly shocking war report: "Yesterday, the powerful American battleship Missouri fired more than 800,000 pounds of shells of death and destruction at military targets in Chongjin City at a rate of 15,000 pounds of shells per minute for one hour. The city is 56 kilometers from the Manchurian border and 160 kilometers from Vladivostok, Russia's largest seaport." Everything in this shocking war report—the joy of "death and destruction" and the report about approaching Vladivostok—reveals General MacArthur's dreams. In addition to this, on October 1, a small group of fascists in New York organized a demonstration; MacArthur's admirers held signs that read: "After crossing the 38th parallel, advance to Moscow."

Murderers are not created in an hour; murderers are educated and trained from childhood. Various American children's magazines publish many cartoons showing new variations of Nazi "supermen" "American supermen" killing Russians. There are many cartoons published there praising the behavior of Ilsa Koch, who skinned people alive. In the "Spark" magazine for children to read, I saw an advertisement for toys: "The famous Spanish Mauser Model 32 rifle, a perfect imitation. Spanish Falangists used this rifle to attack Russia in World War II. This is an American-style six-shot revolver... the famous 9mm German Luger pistol. It is the best weapon now. This is an officer's sidearm." It suggested that children play with the pistols of Falangists and Nazi SS. No one will doubt what these children will do when they advance from toys to real weapons.

In neutral Switzerland, a teacher at the Cantinata Model School dictated the following passage to his students: "Let the Russians come. They will know how courageous we are. We will avenge these beasts for our hanged friends and abducted wives. Forward, to meet the enemy. We will punish him for all his conspiracies! Kill the Russians!" Of course, one can laugh at the knowledge of this teacher in a model school, and one can ask him, which Swiss person was hanged by the Russians, and what wives do the young students in Swiss schools have. However, all this is not a laughing matter, because such an education method is a great danger to all countries and to the people of all countries.

Instructions issued by the United States to officers who carry out military training for primary and secondary school children say: "Instructors must inspire the natural desire to fight and kill." After seeing this, then what Dr. Hans, the president of the University of Florida, said is very understandable: "We must carry out overall preparations based on the law of the jungle. Everyone must learn the art of killing. I will never beg for mercy for patients, for churches, for schools, or for any group of people." Nazi ideas not only continue to exist, but have been surpassed.

Peace advocates, we must resolutely oppose the most dangerous and most deadly weapon—propaganda for a new war. We must do this work while a third world war can still be avoided.

If someone says to me that I am biased, and I only blame one side, then I will answer him: it is possible to find shortcomings and mistakes in our country's newspapers. It is possible to point out that this or that criticism of this or that aspect of Western cultural life is superficial or unfair. However, no political leader, no representative of the Supreme Soviet, no journalist, or teacher in the Soviet Union has called for war against the United States or against any other country.

In our country's newspapers, people can see sharp articles against the policies implemented by the United States, against the capitalist system, and against ideologies that are different from Soviet society. But no one has ever found in our country's newspapers the idea of dropping atomic bombs on New York, attacking London, or occupying Paris. Our schools do not cultivate hatred for the people of other countries, especially the American people. On the contrary, our teachers often draw students' attention to the fact that besides the America of Mr. Johnson or General MacArthur, there is another America that gave the world Lincoln and Roosevelt, Longfellow and Whitman, an America with great scientists and honest working people.

As a Soviet citizen and writer, I want to say very frankly: If the United States and some countries in Western Europe stop war propaganda, this will help us see a more complete, more beautiful, and more friendly picture of the lives and cultures of the American, British, and French people.

We have come here not for the sake of arguing, not for the sake of exacerbating the already dangerous phenomenon of lack of confidence. We have come here for the sake of reaching an agreement on how to maintain and strengthen peace. Precisely because of this, I propose that the esteemed Congress pass the following resolution prohibiting propaganda for a new war and promoting mutual understanding among the people of all countries:

"In view of the fact that propaganda for a new war being carried out by some countries has created the most serious threat to the peaceful cooperation of the people of all countries, and that propaganda for a new war is the most serious crime against humanity, the Second World Peace Congress urges the parliaments of all countries to pass a special law, the 'Law for the Defense of Peace,' which will consider anyone who engages in propaganda for a new war in the form of speeches, newspaper articles, radio broadcasts, or films to be criminally responsible.

The Congress also urges the parliaments of all countries, in order to consolidate peace, to guarantee that the younger generation is educated in the spirit of cooperation with the people of other countries and respect for other races and nations."

This resolution is not directed against any one country or group of countries. It defends the interests of the people of all countries. It does not violate freedom of speech and freedom of the press, no matter how these freedoms are interpreted. Because in all civilized countries there are laws prohibiting incitement to murder. For example, Article 24 of the law on freedom of the press in France stipulates that anyone who incites murder, robbery, or arson is a criminal. Why is it forbidden to incite the killing of one person, but it is okay to incite the killing of 100 million people? Why is it forbidden to rob a store, but it is okay to incite aggression against foreign countries? Why is it forbidden to incite the burning of a barn or a haystack, but it is okay to incite the burning of half the world?

We should not only be concerned with prohibiting war propaganda, but also be concerned with creating the moral conditions necessary for the peaceful coexistence of all countries. It is necessary to stop developing disrespect and hostility towards other nations in the growing generation. It is necessary to fight against all expressions of national and racial arrogance. The development of human culture cannot coexist with isolation, with the creation of artificial barriers, and with major attacks on the cultures and lives of other nations.

We must urge the parliaments of all countries in the world to take measures to ensure that children, adults, and young people are educated in the spirit of peaceful cooperation, mutual understanding, and respect for the national culture of each nation.

What I am referring to is not the philosophical and political unity of the world. There are people in the world who believe in various systems. The Soviet people criticize and will continue to criticize the capitalist system. Conversely, the defenders of the capitalist system can also criticize the Soviet economy and Soviet ideology. Even the most violent criticism will not cause cities to fall, and children will not die as a result. Even the most violent criticism will not hinder the exchange of material and spiritual values necessary for human development. This exchange is currently cut off, and all people are encountering artificial barriers in the same way. It is necessary to change the climate in the world: to dispel the psychology of mutual lack of trust, and to eliminate from people's minds the idea that war is inevitable and war is imminent. Prohibiting the clamoring for war and prohibiting war propaganda will restore lost confidence. I believe that my proposal will receive unanimous support, because the plan I am advocating is not against any one country, not against any one political party, not against any one person, but against war.

I believe in reason. I believe in the scientists who are using all their strength to save people from serious diseases. I believe in the poets who are using their burning passion to warm the cold nights of trench diggers and bricklayers. I believe in the seeds in the gardener's palm. I believe in the mothers who know how life is born and how to protect life.

Those who are planning a new war have used all their strength to prevent us from gathering. The government of that country, which is famous for its ancient civilization, has forbidden one of the most outstanding scientists of our time from entering its territory, simply because he is an advocate of peace. The government that claims to be socialist has forbidden one of the most respectable socialists of our time from entering its territory, simply because he is an advocate of peace. Those who are planning a new war have a lot of money, a lot of gunpowder materials, and a lot of radio waves. However, what meaning do their words have besides making people's hearts beat faster? We never want war to break out. We want to move the muzzle of the gun away from people's chests. On this point, we are completely unanimous, whether we are Communists or Catholics, liberals or socialists, Russians or Americans, British or Chinese. As a representative of the Soviet people, who have known the full burden of war and wholeheartedly hate war, I firmly grasp the hands of those people whom our enemies are vainly trying to represent, the hands of Americans, British, and French people, and I firmly believe that no force can destroy this hand that I am holding tightly.

　　在第二届世界保卫和平大会上
    苏联代表爱伦堡的演说
    【新华社讯】塔斯社华沙十九日电：苏联代表爱伦堡在第二届世界保卫和平大会十八日会议上发表演说称：极大的负担已落在我们每一个人的肩头上。人有权利不顾自己、不顾一切、也不顾危险。我们现在正在想着的不是我们自己的命运。对于在光明与黑暗中的一切儿童，对于伦敦和莫斯科的、巴黎和北京的儿童，对于纽约摩天楼中的儿童，以及对于目前在朝鲜废墟上流浪着的儿童，我们都要负起责任。对于一切心爱的人、对于全世界的各个地方、对于一切城市、对于一切工厂，我们要负起责任。人们怀着惊慌的心情问道：“又战争了吗？……在这样的乱世能够活下去吗？担心着什么时候炸弹会落在儿女的头上，在这样的情况下能够把儿女抚养成人吗？当战争的恶魔使人类文化阴暗无光的时候，能够想到创造丰富的人类文化吗？”
    战争并不是地震，也不是毒风，战争是人们的行为，人们能够防止战争。危险是很大的。每一个人都了解这一点。我们齐集在这儿开会，并不是来高谈阔论，也不是在讨论会上争辩，人们在期望我们发表思虑周到的言论、提出明确的建议，通过大家都可接受的决议：我们必须防止战争。一切男子，一切女人，不管他们住在那里，他们都抱着这种希望。
    有人说：战争是不可避免的，因为世界已分裂成两个世界。因为在莫斯科有着和在纽约不同的法律，因为在有些国家中，共产党人已丧失合法的地位，而在别的国家中，共产党人却在制订法律。美国总统在他的一次演说中说过：“美国以及为同样观念所鼓舞的其他国家，对于那种具有别样的目的和不同的世界观的制度都发生反感。这种制度墨守一种虚妄的哲学。”艾奇逊先生最近把杜鲁门先生的武断之辞背诵了一番，他说：“这种哲学体系的许多方面，特别是像在苏联和若干其他国家中所实践的那样，不仅惹起我们的讨厌，而且更引起了关于善恶的基本概念的问题。”我倒愿意姑且说从杜鲁门先生的观点看来马克思主义是“虚妄的哲学”，姑且说苏维埃制度是使艾奇逊先生讨厌的。我且不谈我对于杜鲁门先生的哲学发生什么感想，也不谈我对于决定艾奇逊先生的行为的伦理学抱着什么态度。然而，哲学体系的或经济的优越性，是不能够用战争来证明的呀。向苏联一百所大学投下一百枚炸弹，决不能由此证明詹姆士的实用主义比唯物史观更胜一筹。战争并不是观念的论战，也不是争辩。
    战争是使所有各族人民及其文化都受到影响的最大的灾难。如果说苏维埃观念或苏维埃的书籍使某些美国人不快活，那么，他们就可以用观念来试图击败这些观念，用书籍来驳倒这些书籍。至于炸弹，它们在这方面是无能为力的。
    美国国内想要保持他们的经济、他们的观念、他们的生活方式的那些人，如果指望战争，那就愚蠢了。过去四十年来的局势演变已表明了战争在加速社会的变革。然而，如果说战争不能够保护资本主义世界免受社会主义观念的影响，那么，战争也当然不是走向社会主义去的道路。力求进步的人民很清楚地认识到，新的世界大战将使人类倒退，毁灭那些建设更美好的社会所必需的物质基础。凡真心诚意热爱自己的前途的公民，没有一个人会同意为了他的观念的胜利而付出这么大的代价。战争不是历史的接生者，战争是摧毁人类精华的“恶魔制造厂”。战争是与我们的苏维埃哲学、我们的伦理学和我们的志愿都不相容的。因为我们对于将来具有信心，而全世界的一切儿童——不仅莫斯科的儿童，而且还有纽约的儿童——都是我们的希望、我们的朋友、我们的同盟者。
    我相信，美国的生活方式使我苦恼并不下于苏联的生活方式使艾奇逊先生苦恼。然而，我主张和平——不仅与法斯特及罗伯逊的美国和平，而且也与杜鲁门和艾奇逊的美国和平共处。我知道，世界上有许多人不喜欢社会主义。我希望杜鲁门和艾奇逊也该知道：世界上有不少的人宁要社会主义而不要资本主义。我们是生活在同一个星球上。这上边有许多余地容纳拥护不同的社会制度的人。他们可以达成协议：不得因为讨厌别人的房子里的主人的思想就去冲破大门闯进房子，也不得只是因为邻人抱着不同的想法、说着不同的话、过着不同的生活，就向邻家的窗户里投掷石子。
    “如果你要和平——就该准备战争。”——一个最好战的国家中的一个最好战的作家的这句危险的格言，现在正由那些正准备战争的、要战争的人们背诵着。他们拚命想使他们本国的同胞相信：世界上飞机炸弹和大炮炮弹越多，孩子们就越能够睡得安静。契柯夫曾经说过：如果在戏剧第一幕中墙上挂着来福枪，那么在最后一幕中就会有人开枪了。战争不能够靠累积武器来防止的。唯有凭借裁减和销毁军备才能够防止战争。
    我们大家都要求制止积累军备，我确信，我们一定会达到这个目的。但是，这是不够的。即使已积累了千千万万的炸弹，如果没有使千百万人民的心灵中毒，依然不可能开始战争，因为战争需要士兵。我是一个作家，我深知文字的魔力，我说这句话觉得很骄傲，又觉得很痛心。文字能够帮助人变成一个英雄，能够号召人去完成庄严的勋业，能够燃起人心中的热爱，而文字也能够使人变成禽兽，使人麻醉，使人丧尽天良，教唆人去干卑鄙的勾当。
    当希特勒率领他的军队去进攻和平国家的时候，人们问道：“老实的市民、忠厚的劳苦人民怎么会跟着那些盗匪和杀人犯走呢？”在各次审判纳粹恶棍的时候，许多人觉得很惊讶：这些心怀恶念的绞刑吏是从那里来的呀？在亚斯威辛（按即德捷边境的纳粹集中营所在地）焚尸炉用火烧死活人的这些恶人是从那里来的呀？剥人皮做灯罩的伊尔萨·科赫是从什么地方爬出来的呀？”
    人们不禁会想起魏玛和海得尔堡，想起在古老的菩提树下散步的普通德国人的谦逊和敏感，想起九柱戏——“纳粹党卫军”的曾祖父们所玩的这种无害的娱乐，想起伊尔萨·科赫的祖母们的那些刺绣女红。残忍嗜血并不是天生的。对暴力的崇拜并不是在普通德国人的血液里本来潜伏着的。藐视其他种族的人民，也并不是魏玛或海得尔堡的居民们神秘的本性。吞并的思想、种族和民族的自大狂、野蛮、不讲道德，这些都是纳粹、纳粹报纸、纳粹学校灌注到普通德国人的心里去的。
    什么人要把经历过的恐怖重演一遍呢？难道华沙应该再看到那些绞刑吏和纵火犯吗？难道巴黎应该再听到占领军的铁蹄的进军吗？难道伦敦应该再听到敌机在天空发出吼声，而把孩子们藏到地下铁道去吗？难道一向主要是从好莱坞制造的影片上认识战争的美国人不应该在本国的土地上目击到烽火、鲜血和死亡吗？
    我们难道可以让新战争爆发吗？那些人正在准备新战争，他们不仅培养杀害人民身体的杆状细菌，而且他们正在腐蚀人民的心灵，他们拚命使千百万大众的内心中毒。用民族优越的观念、对他族人民的仇恨、以及大规模屠杀的意念，来使人民受到感染。如果说我们不能够制裁那些人，这难道可以吗？
    在老百姓看来，战争就是恐怖、就是孩子们的血，就是失掉爱儿的母亲那痴呆的凝视，但是在有些人看来，战争却是救星。他们并不隐瞒他们的诡计，他们在众目睽睽之下，围着桌子坐下来，大吃大喝，高谈阔论。
    美国金融家们的机关报《美国新闻》上写道：“如果和平在实际上有了保证，一切都要破灭了”。这些人害怕和平，他们看到人心日益惶惶，他们反而安心了。苏黎世的“阿飞达”证券交易所向顾客推销美国飞机公司的股票，称之为“战争婴孩”。让我们想想列宁格勒的孩子们，想想科芬德里的孩子们，想想朝鲜的孩子们，让我们说罢：必须制止这种勾当。
    华盛顿发行的《时代先驱报》写道：“我们将派出在四万英尺高空飞行的飞机，我们将不仅以炸弹——原子炸弹、烧夷弹、细菌弹，而且更以氢弹供给那些飞机，以便它们可以去杀死摇篮中的婴孩，正在祈祷的老人和正在做工的劳苦人民。”
    我决不会说这类的要求是正直的美国人民发出来的，在冠有高贵的伟大人物的英名的那座城市中，屠杀儿童、屠杀人民的刽子手们竟能够在那儿生活、在那儿活动、在那儿公开教唆犯罪，这使我痛心。我不能够说那些报纸上的言论是由一些不负责任的人们发表的。我要引用那些人的一些言论，不幸那些人都是应负十足责任的人士，就是说，都是美国国会议员们：
    “被激怒的美国将以原子弹骤雨般地向俄国投掷的时候快要来到了……投掷的炸弹决不止一枚。那将是像洪水一样。我们至少已拥有二百五十枚原子弹和数百种战胜俄国的方法。”——印第安纳州众议员约翰·华尔西。
    “我们拥有四百五十枚原子弹，也许更多一点。这已经够了，可以在俄国每一大工业城市中投上五十枚炸弹。”——密士失必州参议员史坦尼斯。
    “美国将不复在世界遥远的角落发动战争，但一定要把战争打进共产主义俄国的心窝。”——南卡罗林纳州参议员约翰斯敦。
    “在未来的战争开始以后，我们必须在三个星期之内打下莫斯科和俄国的任何其他城市。在最初的三个星期之内，我们必须把苏联所有的军事中心夷为废墟。”——密苏里州众议员康农。
    他们可以再度反驳说：美国有着许多国会议员。他们并非全体都因为睿智温恭而知名。我当然相信立法机关的委员们，应当代表一国人民。但是，如果他们中间有人证明是罪犯或是精神病患者，那么就应该从最高权力机关中把他们免除。但是，侵略战争的号召不但出自议员的嘴巴；美国官方的代表——部长和副部长们也在号召战争。两个月以前，美国的海军部长马休斯就曾向他的同胞建议下面一种确立和平的方法：“我们应该不惜任何代价，甚至发动战争的代价，来强迫实现和平的合作……虽然我们将因此得到对真正民主国家还是陌生的称号——侵略战争的发动者。”
    陆军部次长格里菲斯在夏天说过，他在一九四七年就已经劝告过杜鲁门先生向苏联投掷原子弹了。
    倘使苏联的海军部长说：为了强迫美国合作必须对美国宣战，他将毫无疑问地被交付审判。如果苏联的陆军部副部长建议向美国投炸弹，他将毫无疑问地被关进精神病院。
    别的国家里面也有人号召侵略，也有人发表一心想在人民中间唤起大规模屠杀情绪的演说与文章。尤其是在这样的一个国家，它的政府禁止和平的友人们在设菲尔德开会，但是客客气气地让任何需要战争的人号召人民进行新的可怖的屠杀。就是在这个国家中，一度被认为人道主义者无和平主义者的那位龙钟的哲学家罗素，主张赶快发动世界战争。就是在这个国家中，一位非常受人尊敬的勋爵特连查尔德颂扬原子弹，据他说，原子弹每月可以杀灭一千万至二千万人。
    战争的要求出自英国人之口，这是特别令人心痛的，因为这样的要求跟英国人民对和平的爱好全不相符，因为它们表明了某些英国人的愚盲，他们忘记了他们的海岛将是他们所号召的战争最先的牺牲品。
    战争的号召甚至在一个清楚记得战争恐怖的国家——法国回响起来。我了解这个国家而且爱它。我要说一句，在法国号召战争的人们，那些用法语说话用法文写字的人们，不能称为法国人。他们的过去，正如他们的现在一样，表明了他们只是把并非法国的思想译为法国文字而已。我不得不回想起一项由政客雷诺签署的惊动人类的文件，他有一个时候曾任命卖国贼贝当做他的副手，同时回想起诗人克劳岱，他有一个时候曾写热情的颂诗来歌颂这个卖国贼。
    我要说一说“国际欧洲问题研究委员会”的报告书。在这份报告书里面，大规模屠杀人民的行为受到赞扬。为了屠杀六千万至七千万人民，这份报告书建议使用原子弹与氢弹，杆状细菌与毒药，毁灭牲畜与农作物，窒息性瓦斯以及国际公约所禁止使用的其他杀人的手段。就我所知，这份报告书的编撰人并未受到谴责并且继续在从事远非合于人道的勾当。从文字向行动的转变引起了某些人士的热情，“马赛法兰西”报写道：“目前在朝鲜进行的事情应该在匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、东德以及波罗的海国家进行。”
    在朝鲜进行的暴虐的事件使那些野蛮的梦想见诸实现。麦克阿瑟将军所签署的战报都以残忍著称，这种残忍性甚至使那些经历过纳粹侵略恐怖的人们也大为吃惊。法国实业界的喉舌“世界报”刊载麦克阿瑟总部十月十四日的战报指出，这个战报的措辞“有时令人吃惊”。下面便是从这个真正令人吃惊的战报中引用的一段：“美国强大的战舰密苏里号昨日以每分钟一万五千磅炮弹的速率在一小时内向清津城的军事目标发射了八十万磅以上死亡与毁灭的炮弹，该城距满洲边境五十六公里，距俄国最大的海港海参崴一百六十公里。”这个惊人战报中的一切——对于“死亡与毁灭”的喜悦以及关于接近海参崴的报道，都泄露了麦克阿瑟将军的梦想。除此之外还有一件事，十月一日纽约曾有一小撮法西斯分子组织示威游行；麦克阿瑟的崇拜者拿着标语牌，上面写着：“冲过三八线以后，向莫斯科前进。”
    杀人犯并不是在一个钟头之内造成的，杀人犯是从儿童时代教养和训练出来的。美国的各种儿童杂志上刊载着许多滑稽画，表示纳粹“超人”的新变种“美国超人”杀死俄国人。那里刊载着许多滑稽画，歌颂活剥人皮的伊尔萨·科赫的行为。在给小孩阅读的“火花”杂志上，我曾看到一幅玩具广告：“著名的西班牙摩斯莱三二式枪，仿制维妙维肖。西班牙长枪党员在第二次世界大战中曾用此枪攻打俄国。这是一种美国式的六发连发手枪……著名的九毫米的德国卢吉尔式枪。是现在的最好的武器。这是军官的防身武器”。它建议儿童玩长枪党员和纳粹党卫军的手枪。任何人都不会怀疑，当这些儿童把玩具进展到真正武器的时候，他们会干出什么事来。
    在中立的瑞士，干蒂纳塔模范学校的一位教师向他的学生口授如下一段文字：“让俄国人来吧。他们将知道我们的勇气如何。我们将为我们被绞死的朋友和被掳劫的妻子向这些野兽报仇。前进，去迎接敌人吧。我们将为他的一切阴谋而惩罚他！打死俄国人！”当然，人们对模范学校这位教师的知识可以付之一笑，人们可以问他，那一个瑞士人被俄国人绞杀了，瑞士学堂的幼小学生有什么妻子。然而，这一切并不是什么笑料，因为这样的教育方法对于各国以及对于各国人民乃是一个极大的危险。
    美国发给执行中小学儿童军事训练的军官们的训令说：“教官必须鼓舞战斗与杀人的自然愿望”。看了这个之后，那末，佛罗里达大学校长汉斯博士所说的话就十分可以理解了，他说：“我们必须进行根据弱肉强食的法则的总体准备。每个人必须学会杀人的艺术。我决不为病人、为教会、为学校或者为任何一群人乞怜。”纳粹的思想不仅继续存在，而且已被超过了。
    和平拥护者们，我们必须坚决地反对最危险的、最致命的武器——反对新战争的宣传。我们必须在第三次世界大战还可以避免的时候来做这个工作。
    如果有人对我说我是有偏见的，我只责备一方面，那么我就要答复他：可能在我国的报纸上发现缺点与错误。可能指出这一篇或那一篇批评对西方文化生活的这一面或那一面批评得浮浅或者不公平。但是，苏联决没有一个政治领袖、一个最高苏维埃代表、一个记者或是教师要求对美国或是对任何别的国家进行战争。
    人们在我国的报纸上可以看到反对美国所执行的政策，反对资本主义制度，反对与苏维埃社会相异的意识形态的尖锐的文章。但是决没有人在我国报纸上发现向纽约投原子弹、进攻伦敦、占领巴黎的主张。我国的学校并不培养对别国人民、尤其是对美国人民的仇恨。恰恰相反，我们的教师经常地唤起学生们注意，除了詹森先生或麦克阿瑟将军的美国之外，还有另一个给了世界以林肯和罗斯福、郎费罗和惠特曼的美国，一个拥有伟大科学家和诚实力行的劳动人民的美国。
    作为一个苏联的公民和作家，我要非常坦率地说一句：美国和西欧某些国家停止战争宣传，这将有助于我们看到关于美国、英国、法国人民生活与文化的更完满、更优美而且更友好的景象。
    我们到这里来并不是为的争论，并不是为的加重已经带有危险的缺乏信心的现象。我们到这里来是为的就如何在维持和加强和平这一点上面达成协议。正因为这样，我建议可敬的大会通过禁止新战争宣传和促进各国人民互相谅解的如下决议：
    “鉴于某些国家所进行的新战争宣传已造成对各国人民和平合作的最严重的威胁，而新战争宣传是残害人类的最严重的罪行，第二届世界保卫和平大会特敦促各国议会通过一项特别的法律‘保卫和平法律’，此项法律将认为凡以演说、报章文字、广播或电影等形式从事新战争宣传者，均应负刑事责任。
    大会并敦促各国议会，为了巩固和平，应保证以与他国人民实行合作及尊重其他种族和民族的精神来教育年青的一代。”
    这一项决议并不是针对任何一个国家或一批国家而发的。它保卫各国人民的利益。它不侵犯言论和新闻的自由，不管这些自由被人怎样去解释。因为在一切文明国家内都有禁止教唆杀人的法律。例如，在法国，关于新闻自由的法律第二十四条，凡是教唆杀人、抢劫或放火者就构成刑事犯。为什么教唆杀死一个人则被禁止，而教唆杀死一亿人却是应该的呢？为什么抢劫一所商店则被禁止，而教唆侵略外国却是应该的呢？为什么教唆烧去一所谷仓或者一个干草堆则被禁止，而教唆烧去半个世界却是应该的呢？
    我们不但应该关心于禁止战争宣传，而且应该关心于创造为各国和平共存所必需的道德条件。必须停止在成长中的一代当中发展对其他民族的不尊重和敌视。必须为反对关于民族和种族的自大狂的一切表现而斗争。人类文化的发展，和隔离、和创造人为的障碍、和大事攻击其它民族的文化及生活，都是不能并立的。
    我们必须敦促世界各国的议会采取措施，保证以和平合作、相互了解和尊重每一民族的民族文化的精神去教育儿童们，成人们和青年们。
    我所指的并不是全世界哲学和政治的统一。世界上有信仰各种制度的人们。苏联人民批评并将继续批评资本主义制度。反过来，资本主义制度的保卫者们也可以批评苏维埃的经济和苏维埃的意识形态。即便是最猛烈的批评，城市也不会因而陷落，孩子们也不会因而死去。即便是最猛烈的批评，也不会阻碍交换为人类发展所必需的物质和精神的价值。这种交换目前是断绝了，一切人民都是同样地遭遇到人为的障碍。必须改变世界上的气候：驱散相互缺乏信任的心理，从人们的思想中消除战争不可避免和战争迫近的思想。禁止叫嚣战争，禁止战争宣传，将会恢复已失的信心。我相信我的提案会得到一致的支持，因为我所主张的方案不是反对任何一个国家，不是反对任何一个政党，不是反对任何一个人，而是反对战争。
    我相信理性。我相信用全力把人民从严重的疾病中挽救过来的科学家。我相信那用燃烧的热情去使掘壕者和砌砖者的寒夜变得温暖的诗人。我相信园丁掌心中的种子。我相信那些知识如何诞生生命和如何保护生命的母亲们。
    正在计划新战争的人们曾经用尽一切力量阻挠我们集会。以它的古老文明而驰名的那一个国家的政府，曾经禁止我们时代最卓越的科学家之一进入它的国土，只是因为他是和平拥护者的缘故。自称社会主义的政府，曾经禁止我们时代最可敬的社会主义者之一进入它的国土，只是因为他是和平拥护者的缘故。正在计划新战争的人们，有许多金钱，许多火药原料，许多无线电波。然而他们的言语除了使人心跳以外还有什么意义呢？我们决不愿使战争爆发。我们要把枪口从人的胸膛上转移开去。在这一点上我们是完全一致的，无论共产党员或天主教徒，自由主义者或社会主义者，俄国人或美国人，英国人或中国人。作为已经知道战争的全部负担和衷心憎恨战争的苏联人民的一个代表，我紧握着我们的敌人们所妄想代表的那些人们的手，美国人、英国人和法国人的手，我坚决相信没有任何一种力量能够摧毁我这一只紧握的手。
