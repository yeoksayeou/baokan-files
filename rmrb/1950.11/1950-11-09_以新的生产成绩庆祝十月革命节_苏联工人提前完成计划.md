　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th: TASS, Moscow, 6th—The Soviet people are greeting the 33rd anniversary of the October Revolution with new production victories. From enterprises in Moscow, from cities in Leningrad and Kharkov, from the Baltic republics and other regions of the country, good news of completing production plans ahead of schedule is pouring in.
    In recent days, many enterprises in Moscow have overproduced goods worth millions of rubles above their plans. In October, dozens of workshops, hundreds of work teams and groups have become collective Stakhanov work shifts. Workers at the Stalin Automobile Factory have completed their ten-month plan two weeks ahead of schedule, and more than 800 workers in one foundry have completed their five-year plan. Female workers at the "Red Rose" textile factory have exceeded their five-year plan, producing enough textiles to cover the 9,000-kilometer distance from Moscow to Vladivostok. The "Warrior" factory has overproduced many machines. Textile workers at the Three Mountains Textile Factory have overproduced millions of meters of high-quality fabrics. Workers at the Krasnokholm Factory have overproduced more than 400,000 meters of wool yarn.
    The working people of Leningrad have produced many machine tools for the hydroelectric power station on the Volga River to commemorate the October Revolution. Many enterprises have completed their annual production plans.
    The daily output of each Stakhanovite work shift in Tallinn, the capital of the Estonian Republic, is equivalent to the national output of Estonia under bourgeois rule for five days. The Stakhanovite work shifts in each factory have mastered the production of hundreds of new goods. Hundreds of enterprises in Riga, the capital of Latvia, have completed their annual plans, and the city's industry as a whole had completed 134.5 percent of its five-year plan by October 1.
    Thirty-two enterprises in Kharkov, the industrial center of Ukraine, have completed their five-year plans and overproduced goods worth hundreds of millions of rubles. On the eve of the festival, the Turbine Factory completed all the orders required for the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station ahead of schedule, and sent the first huge turbine to the construction site on the 5th. Miners of the Bobovsk Coal Mine Trust in the Donets Basin have completed their annual coal production plan. Miners in the Kazakh Republic have over-mined dozens of trainloads of coal.
    Collective farmers across the country are reporting that they have overfulfilled their production tasks. State farms and collective farms in Kazakhstan have over-delivered more than 13 million poods of grain. New reports of good news are constantly coming from Ukraine, Siberia, Crimea, and Moldavia.
