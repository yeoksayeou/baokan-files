　　At the Bedside
　　Sheminov (drawing) Krotky (text)
　　Capitalism is sick. The disease is incurable, but the "specialist doctors" are trying their best to save the patient. The doctors' consultations have not yet reached full agreement, but all methods have already been exhausted. Chief Physician Truman feeds the patient artificial nutrients made from military orders. Military Doctor Marshall hurriedly serves with a "hydrogen pillow": he believes that if hydrogen is used, the disease will be alleviated... and perhaps even become stronger! Acheson, the "dermatology" expert, supports his method. Churchill, this "European celebrity," agrees with his American colleagues in all respects. With the qualification of a "celebrity," he cannot even put down his habitually smoked cigar at the patient's bedside. This is unavoidable!
　　For his own special cigar
　　The Fulton diplomat is addicted:
　　Its characteristic is a burnt smell,
　　Without the fragrance of tobacco!
　　Peeking out from behind Dr. Churchill is the bloodletting nurse Mock. His job is a small matter: just bleed others as instructed. Here is also De Gaulle, holding his own (more precisely, not his own, but Hitler's) fascist dictatorship medicine to save capitalism.
　　Doctors who have not figured out the root cause of the disease do not have a definite diagnosis. Bevin and Attlee want to inject a small amount of their "specially sold socialism" into the patient's relaxed capitalist body to treat him. The patient himself did not feel any special hope for this treatment. He knows that,
　　Wherever Doctor Bevin has treated,
　　It always ends in sadness.
　　The patient is getting worse and worse! The "head ice pack" (in the form of a "Cold War") treatment advocated by the doctors cannot reduce the high fever in his stock exchange. The "hot war" compress advocated by MacArthur and its protracted "surgery" made the patient even weaker. His body temperature rises and falls with the ups and downs of stocks. He speaks deliriously of world hegemony and demands (it seems unbelievable, but he is indeed demanding!) North Atlantic Water (Treaty!)... but he himself does not believe in its efficacy. In moments of temporary clarity, he even said:
　　I'm afraid, Atlantic water
　　May bring me misfortune!
　　Around the patient, his sad friends are rushing about. Lie uses the United Nations' fresh resolutions to fan his feverish face. Franco covers his face and cries with the handkerchief given by the dying patient. Servants (Adenauer, Schumacher, etc.) are also busy fulfilling their last bit of responsibility to their master.
　　Pharmacist Tito is not sitting idle either: according to the prescriptions of British and American doctors, he is preparing a dose of poisonous medicine.
　　(Jun Qiang translated from the Soviet Komsomolskaya Pravda on November 5)

　　在病床旁
    谢米诺夫画  克罗特基文
    资本主义病倒了。病是无法救治的，但“专门医师们”却要尽力来挽救病人。医师们的会诊还没有取得充分的协议，一切方法可就已经使尽了。主任医师杜鲁门拿军事定单做成的人工营养品给病人吃。军医马歇尔急忙用“氢气枕头”来伺候：他认为如果采用了氢气，病势会减轻些……甚至也许会健壮起来！艾奇逊，这位“皮肤科”专家支持他的办法。“欧洲名士”邱吉尔在各方面都同意他的美国同事们的主张。凭着“名士”的资格，他甚至在病人床边，也丢不开他那惯吸的雪茄。这是无可奈何的！
    对自己的特殊的雪茄
    富尔敦外交家上了瘾：
    它的特征是烧焦的气味，
    没有烟草的香味！
    从邱吉尔医师背后伸着头看的是放血的看护莫克。他的事情是小事情：依照嘱咐给别人放血就行了。这儿还有戴高乐捧着他自己的（确切些说并不是他自己的，而是希特勒的）用法西斯独裁来救治资本主义的药剂。
    没有摸清病根的医师，也就没有确实的诊断。贝文和艾德礼想用少量自己“专卖的社会主义”灌入病人的松弛的资本主义机体去医治他。病人自己对于这种治疗法也没有感到什么特殊的希望。他知道，
    贝文医师诊治过的地方，
    到头总是悲伤。
    病人愈来愈不行了！医师们所主张的“头部冰罨”（用“冷战”形式）的疗法，不能降低他交易所的高热。麦克阿瑟所主张的“热战”罨法及其拖延的“手术”，使病人更加虚弱了。他的体温随着股票时涨时落。他说着世界霸权的谵语，要求（似乎难以相信罢，但是的确要求着！）北大西洋水（公约！）……但是自己也不相信它的功效。在暂时清醒的时刻，他甚至还说：
    我怕，大西洋水
    也许要带给我祸害吧！
    在病人的四周，他的悲哀的朋友们奔忙着。赖伊用联合国的新鲜决议扇着他那发烧的脸。佛朗哥用垂死的病人所赠送的手绢儿蒙着脸哭。仆人们（阿登纳、舒马赫等人）也忙着给自己的主子尽最后的一点责任。
    药剂师铁托也不是无事闲坐着的：他按照英美医师们的处方，正在配一剂有毒的药。
