　　Adapting to the Needs of the Masses to Create New Songs
    Beijing-Tianjin Music and Poetry Workers Gather to Sing Songs of Battle to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea
    [This newspaper] To vigorously reflect the current fervent emotions of the broad masses to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend the country, and to meet the urgent needs of the masses, music workers from Beijing and Tianjin, including Lü Ji, Zhou Weizhi, Zhao Feng, Li Ling, Ma Ke, Li Huanzhi, Zhang Fei, and poetry workers Yan Chen, Wang Yaping, and Lü Jian, held a symposium at the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles on November 3rd. Lü Ji, who chaired the meeting, explained that music workers and poetry workers should be better organized to strengthen creation. Everyone enthusiastically exchanged opinions and unanimously agreed that current music creation should use clear and powerful rhythms to reflect the surging emotions of the masses resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, protecting their homes and defending the country, strengthen the education of patriotism and internationalism, and strongly expose the brutal and desperate plight of U.S. imperialism. Ren Hong, Ma Ke, and others sang the songs of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea that they had recently created on the spot, and Zhang Fei recited the lyrics written by Liu Jia. These works reflect the Chinese people's intolerable emotions towards U.S. imperialist aggression against Korea and our border, and their determination to defend the motherland. The creation team of the People's Drama Academy and the creation team of the Cultural Troupe of the Political Department of the North China Military Region also reported their creation plans to the meeting. It was decided at the meeting to compile and print "A Collection of Songs to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea," and a second symposium will be held on the 12th of this month, inviting more music, poetry workers, and representatives from workers, students, and Quyi circles to participate, in order to concentrate efforts on doing this work well.

　　适应群众需要创作新的歌曲
    京津音乐诗歌工作者集会
    唱出抗美援朝的战斗歌声
    【本报讯】为了有力地反映当前广大群众的抗美援朝，保家卫国的炽热情绪，适应群众的急迫需要，更有组织地展开音乐创作，京津音乐工作者吕骥、周巍峙、赵沨、李凌、马可、李焕之、张非等与诗歌工作者严辰、王亚平、吕剑等于十一月三日在全国文联举行座谈会。会议主持者吕骥说明音乐工作者与诗歌工作者应更好地组织起来，加强创作。大家热烈地交换了意见，一致同意目前音乐创作应该用明确有力的节奏，反映群众抗美援朝、保家卫国的高涨情绪，加强爱国主义与国际主义的教育，并强烈地暴露美帝的残暴狼狈的窘相。当场并有任虹、马可等试唱他们最近创作的抗美援朝的歌曲，张非朗诵了刘佳所写的歌词。这些作品中反映了中国人民对于美帝侵略朝鲜及我国边境的不能容忍的情绪和保卫祖国的决心。人民戏剧学院创作组及华北军区政治部文工团创作组等单位亦向会议报告了他们的创作计划。会中决定要编印“抗美援朝歌选”并定于本月十二日召开第二次座谈会，将邀集更多的音乐、诗歌工作者及工人、学生、曲艺界代表参加，以集中力量做好这一工作。
