　　The Second World Peace Congress, attended by 1,396 representatives from more than 70 countries around the world, opened on November 16 at the Polish Language Publishing House in Warsaw, the capital of Poland. The congress was originally scheduled to be held in Sheffield, England, but the British Attlee government, following the orders of the US State Department, did its utmost to obstruct it. The congress was then moved to Warsaw at the invitation of the Polish people. The US-British imperialists' blatant use of despicable means such as refusing entry to peace representatives, detaining peace representatives, and deporting peace representatives to undermine the peace movement is enough to show that they have shed the various "peace" and "democracy" disguises they usually use to deceive people, and exposed the hideous faces of war-mongers to the people of the world. From this, the people of the world can understand who advocates war and who loves peace.
    The actions of the US-British war-mongers to obstruct the World Peace Congress also demonstrate that the world peace movement has developed to the point where it can shake the US-British imperialist camp and terrify the war-mongers. They clearly see that the struggle of the people of the world to defend peace is seriously hindering their plans to create war, and therefore they do not hesitate to take despicable measures to obstruct the congress from being held in England.
    Since the First World Peace Congress, the strength of the world's peace-keeping forces has indeed greatly increased. Five hundred million people around the world have signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal. These good people, despite their different nationalities, social strata, religions, and political beliefs, unanimously call for the banning of atomic weapons and unanimously demand that those who first use atomic weapons be declared war criminals. This global movement has increasingly isolated the war-mongers. The peace signature campaign launched by the First World Peace Congress has already dealt a powerful blow to the war-mongers, and it can be predicted how great a force the new struggle to be launched by the Second World Peace Congress will exert. Therefore, the war-mongers' fear of peace is justified.
    The achievements since the First World Peace Congress have made it possible for the Second World Peace Congress to put forward new tasks. The preparatory committee of the Second World Peace Congress issued a statement: "The scope of the achievements that the unity of hundreds of millions of people around the world has already achieved can be further expanded. Prohibiting weapons of mass destruction, ending the arms race, gradually controlling disarmament, defining aggression and condemning aggression, prohibiting war propaganda, respecting the United Nations Charter, respecting the right of all peoples to determine their own destiny, peacefully resolving ongoing military conflicts, and restoring economic and cultural exchanges—these are some of the issues currently being discussed by various countries as part of the preparations for the Peace Congress."
    Based on this proposal from the preparatory committee, the Second World Peace Congress, after opening in Warsaw on the 16th, immediately resolved to establish the following committees to study and carry out various tasks: (1) Political Committee, (2) Committee on Banning Atomic Weapons, General Disarmament and its Supervision Methods, (3) Committee on the Prohibition of War Propaganda, (4) Committee on Establishing Normal International Economic Relations, (5) Committee on Establishing Normal International Cultural Relations, (6) Committee on the Definition of the Concept of Aggression, (7) Organizing Committee.
    In this way, the Second World Peace Congress has advanced the peace movement to a higher stage: not only demanding the banning of atomic weapons, but also demanding the reduction of other armaments, including artillery, tanks, airplanes, warships, etc., in order to gradually achieve the goal of prohibiting war. In order to achieve this goal, it is also necessary to prohibit war propaganda, prohibit aggression, and develop normal international economic and cultural relations.
    These demands are in line with the wishes of the vast majority of people around the world. People of all countries, regardless of their political beliefs, as long as they have the sincerity to oppose war, will support these slogans and be willing to do their part to realize these slogans. Therefore, it can be believed that after the Second World Peace Congress, the world peace movement will have new developments, thereby further striking at the aggressors' plans to create war.
    In order to defend world peace, the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries have made great efforts in peaceful construction and resistance to aggression. The victorious completion of the Soviet Union's post-war five-year construction plan, the unprecedented growth of the strength of socialist countries, and the vigorous development of economic construction in various people's democratic countries indicate the unprecedented growth of world peace forces. The great action of 475 million Chinese people resisting American aggression and volunteering to aid the Korean people in their war of resistance is seriously striking at American imperialism's aggression against China and other Asian countries. This action is currently the central link in the movement to defend world peace. In addition, the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries uphold justice and condemn aggressors in United Nations organizations, echoing the just calls of the people of the world to uphold peace. The various struggles of working people in capitalist countries to refuse to transport military supplies and oppose wars of aggression are also enough to make the war-mongers tremble. The strength of the world peace camp is growing stronger day by day. Through this congress, further expanding unity can further prevent the conspiracies of the war-mongers.

### 第二届世界保卫和平大会的任务

　　第二届世界保卫和平大会的任务
    全世界七十多国家的一千三百九十六位代表参加的第二届世界保卫和平大会已于十一月十六日在波兰首都华沙的波兰语出版社大厦开幕。本届大会原定在英国设菲尔德举行，但英国艾德礼政府听从美国国务院的命令，竭力予以阻挠，大会乃应波兰人民的邀请，改在华沙举行。美英帝国主义者这次公然用拒绝和平代表入境、扣留和平代表和驱逐和平代表出境的卑劣手段来破坏和平运动，这正足以说明他们已经卸除了平日用以欺人的“和平”“民主”的各种掩饰，把战争贩子的狰狞面目暴露于全世界人民之前。全世界人民从此可以明白：谁主张战争，谁爱好和平。
    美英战争贩子这种阻碍世界和大的行动，又说明世界保卫和平运动已经发展到足以震撼英美帝国主义阵营，使战争贩子们胆战心惊。他们显然看到全世界人民保卫和平的斗争严重地妨碍着他们制造战争的计划，因而不惜采取阻碍和大在英国举行的卑劣手段。
    自从第一届和大举行以来，世界保卫和平的力量的确是大大地增强了。全世界已有五亿人签名在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上，这些善良的人民，尽管国籍不同，阶层不同，宗教和政治信仰不同，一致呼吁禁绝原子武器，一致要求将首先使用原子武器的人宣布为战争罪犯。这个普及全世界的运动使战争贩子们日益孤立起来了。第一届和大所发动的和平签名运动已经给予战争贩子们以强有力的打击，第二届和大将要发动的新的斗争将发挥如何巨大的力量是可以预料的。因而，战争贩子们的害怕和平，是有理由的。
    第一届和大以来的成就使第二届和大有了提出新的任务的可能。第二届和大的筹委会发出声明：“全世界亿万人民团结所已获到之成就的范围还能更加扩大一些。禁止大规模毁灭人类的武器，结束军备竞赛，逐步管制裁军，确定侵略定义并谴责侵略，禁止战争宣传，尊重联合国宪章，和各族人民有决定自己的命运权利，和平解决现在进行中的军事冲突，恢复经济文化交流——这是各国现在讨论中的一部分问题，作为和平大会准备的一部分。”
    根据筹委会的这个建议，第二届和大十六日在华沙开幕之后，即议决成立以下各委员会，以研究进行各项工作：（一）政治委员会，（二）禁止原子武器，普遍裁减军备及其监督办法委员会，（三）禁止战争宣传问题委员会，（四）建立国际正常经济关系问题委员会，（五）建立国际正常文化关系问题委员会，（六）侵略概念定义委员会，（七）组织委员会。
    这样，第二届和大把保卫和平运动推进了更高的阶段：不仅要求禁止原子武器，还要求裁减其他军备，包括大炮、坦克、飞机、战舰等等，以逐步达到禁止战争的目的。为着达到这目的，还要禁止战争宣传，禁止侵略，和发展国际正常的经济和文化关系。
    这些要求是符合全世界绝大多数人民的愿望的。各国人民，不管他们的政治信仰如何，只要有反对战争的诚意，都会拥护这些口号并愿意为实现这些口号而尽一分力量的。因此，可以相信，第二届和大开会之后，世界保卫和平的运动将有新的发展，从而使侵略者制造战争的计划受到进一步的打击。
    为了保卫世界和平，苏联、中国、及其他人民民主国家曾在和平建设与反抗侵略方面作了巨大的努力。苏联战后五年建设计划之胜利完成，社会主义国家力量之空前壮大，以及各人民民主国家经济建设之蓬勃发展，表示世界和平力量的空前增长。中国四万七千五百万人民反抗美国侵略和志愿援助朝鲜人民抗战的伟大行动，严重地打击着美帝国主义对中国及其他亚洲国家的侵略，这一行动是目前保卫世界和平运动的中心环节。此外苏联和人民民主国家在联合国机构中伸张正义和斥责侵略者，与全世界人民拥护和平的正义呼声相呼应，各资本主义国家劳动人民拒运军火物资及反对侵略战争的各种斗争，也都足使战争贩子胆寒。世界和平阵营的力量正在日益增强，经过本届大会，进一步扩大团结，也就可以进一步制止战争贩子的阴谋。
