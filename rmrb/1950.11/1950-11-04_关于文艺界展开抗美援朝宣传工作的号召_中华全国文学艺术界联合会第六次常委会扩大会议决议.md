　　I. American imperialism, the head of the world's aggressive camp, is stepping up its conspiracy to dominate the world and prepare for a new war. American imperialism is carrying out armed aggression against our neighbor, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. At the same time, it is openly colluding with the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to occupy our territory of Taiwan. It is also directing special agents and spies lurking in various provinces of the mainland to organize bandits and carry out various sabotage activities. The United Nations, manipulated by the United States, has passed illegal resolutions to expand its aggression against Korea, extending the flames of war to the edge of our territory. Since August, American planes have repeatedly violated our airspace and territorial waters, harming our compatriots. This is a direct invasion of the territory of the People's Republic of China and a serious threat to our security. American imperialism has long been plotting to turn China into its colony. Therefore, in the Chinese people's war of liberation for independence and freedom, American imperialism used all its strength to support the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang bandit gang in attacking the Chinese people. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, it has consistently adopted a hostile attitude towards the Chinese people. American imperialism is the most dangerous enemy of the People's Republic of China.

　　II. American imperialism's aggression against Korea is the first step in its arrogant plan to invade China, invade Asia, and invade the world. The Korean people, under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung, have bravely resisted the American aggressors, achieved great success, and won the sympathy and assistance of the people of the world. The Korean people are very determined and brave. Although they have encountered serious difficulties in the war, they will overcome all difficulties and strive for the final glorious victory with the help of the people of the world. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is our close brotherly country. The Korean people fought alongside us to overthrow Japanese imperialism. We are comrades-in-arms who share weal and woe. Due to the frantic expansion of the flames of aggressive war by American imperialism, the safety and well-being of the Chinese and Korean people are more closely linked together. The Chinese people must support our brotherly country that has been invaded, stop the crimes of the American aggressors, and resolutely oppose the conspiracy of the American imperialists to expand the war. The Chinese people cannot tolerate imperialist aggression, nor can they stand idly by while the aggressors harm their friendly neighbors. The Chinese people fervently love peace, but in order to defend peace, they are not afraid of resisting wars of aggression.

　　III. China's literary and art circles have consistently served the cause of people's liberation and have consistently promoted the glorious tradition of loving the motherland and the people, opposing imperialism, and opposing aggression. Now, a spontaneous movement of resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding the home, and defending the country has begun to unfold enthusiastically among the people of the whole country. The literary and art circles should support this movement and participate in this movement. We must use literary and artistic forms to expose the American imperialists' arrogant ambition to dominate the world, dismantle all their conspiracies and tricks, and denounce all their brutal, shameless, and cowardly acts of aggression. We must promote the great spirit of the Chinese nation of not fearing violence and helping friendly neighbors, and promote the spirit of combining patriotism and internationalism. Some people in the Chinese people have also been deceived by the imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and therefore have pro-American, flattering-American, and afraid-of-American mentalities. We should use the powerful weapon of literature and art to change this wrong mentality and universally establish a correct attitude of hating America, despising America, and looking down on America among the Chinese people.

　　IV. To fight against the corrupt and decadent culture of the United States is a task that our literary and art circles must especially undertake. The so-called "American way of life" is a most corrupt and decadent way of life. It simply transforms the relationship between people into a trading relationship, with only private interests in mind. American culture is full of philistinism and licentious depravity. The world's bourgeois culture has long begun to decline, and now it is even more obviously declining. The modern American bourgeois culture produced by the so-called "American way of life" under the rule of Wall Street financial oligarchs is especially thoroughly philistine, vulgar, and despicable, lacking creativity and lofty ideals. The vast majority of Americans are deceived and anesthetized in this "American culture." The increasingly fascist American government has implemented a series of regulations to control thought, and a few progressive writers have been imprisoned and persecuted. The American literary scene is now rampant with evil spirits, taking licentiousness and murder as "bravery," money worship as a "view of life," and low taste as technique. In order to defend human culture and the upward development of literature and art, we must also resolutely oppose American imperialism.

　　V. The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles calls on all associations under the Federation and all local literary and art organizations throughout the country to take unified action and widely launch the propaganda movement of resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding the home, and defending the country through the following activities:

　　1. Widely mobilize writers to write, and use forms such as poetry, living newspapers, essays, dramas, movies, reports, novels, paintings, and songs to conduct in-depth and universal propaganda. Special attention should be paid to using forms such as pictures, storytelling, folk art, living newspapers, and short plays that are most easily accepted by the broad masses of the people.

　　2. Suggest that national literary and art newspapers and periodicals regularly and systematically publish articles and works related to resisting America and aiding Korea, and increase topical essays.

　　3. Suggest that literary and art groups and drama troupes throughout the country carry out propaganda for resisting America and aiding Korea, and carry out propaganda activities for resisting America and aiding Korea in rural areas, factories, and troops in the form of living newspapers, short plays, performances, songs and dances, and folk art.

　　4. Organize and educate folk artists so that they can also actively and effectively participate in this propaganda activity. Expose and smash the shameless rumors spread by special agents and spies through them. Conduct propaganda and agitation for resisting America and aiding Korea, targeting various viewpoints of some people in the masses who still lack understanding of American imperialism.

　　5. Organize various lectures, forums, and recitations.

　　6. Establish further contacts with literary and art organizations and writers and artists from all countries in the world who love peace and democracy, exchange works, and fight together to defend world peace and oppose American imperialist aggression.

　　关于文艺界展开抗美援朝宣传工作的号召
    ——中华全国文学艺术界联合会第六次常委会扩大会议决议
    一、美帝国主义、全世界侵略阵营的头子，正在加紧进行它的独霸世界、准备新战争的阴谋。美帝国主义武装侵略我们的邻邦朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，同时还公开与蒋匪残余勾结，侵占我们的国土台湾，并指挥在大陆各省潜伏的特务间谍分子、组织土匪，进行种种破坏工作。在美帝操纵下的联合国，通过了非法决议，扩大对朝鲜的侵略，把战火烧到我国领土的边沿。美帝飞机从八月以后屡屡侵犯我国的领空领海，伤害我国同胞。这对于中华人民共和国的领土，是一种直接的侵犯，对于我国的安全，是一种严重的威胁。美帝国主义早已处心积虑要把中国变成它的殖民地，所以在中国人民争取独立自由的解放战争中，美帝国主义用一切力量支持蒋介石国民党匪帮进攻中国人民，在中华人民共和国成立以后，更一贯采取敌视中国人民的态度。美帝国主义是中华人民共和国最危险的敌人。
    二、美帝国主义侵略朝鲜是它侵略中国、侵略亚洲、侵略全世界的狂妄计划中的第一步。朝鲜人民在金日成将军领导下，英勇地抵抗美国侵略者，曾取得很大成就，获得了全世界人民的同情与援助。朝鲜人民是十分坚决和勇敢的，现在在战争中虽然遭遇到严重的困难，但是在全世界人民的援助下，一定会克服所有的困难，争取到最后的光荣的胜利。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国是我们亲密的兄弟国家，朝鲜人民曾和我们并肩作战，打倒了日本帝国主义。我们是患难相共，甘苦同尝的战友。由于美帝国主义疯狂地扩大侵略战争的火焰，中国人民与朝鲜人民的安危祸福是更加紧密地联结在一起了。中国人民一定要支援我们被侵略的兄弟国家，制止美国侵略者的罪行，坚决地反对美帝扩大战争的阴谋。中国人民不能容忍帝国主义的侵略，也不能听任侵略者伤害自己的友邻而置之不理。中国人民热烈地爱好和平，但是为了保卫和平，绝不害怕反抗侵略的战争。
    三、中国文学艺术界一贯地为人民解放的事业而服务，一贯地发扬爱祖国爱人民，反对帝国主义、反对侵略的光荣传统。现在在全国人民中已开始热烈地展开了抗美援朝、保家卫国的自发的运动，文学艺术界应该支持这个运动，参加这个运动。我们要用文学艺术的形式来揭露美帝国主义梦想独霸世界的狂妄的野心，拆穿他们的一切阴谋诡计，控诉他们的一切残暴、无耻、卑怯的侵略罪行。我们要发扬中国民族的不畏强暴、援助友邻的伟大精神，发扬爱国主义与国际主义相结合的精神。中国人民中也有一部分人曾受了帝国主义者和蒋匪帮的欺骗，因而有亲美媚美和恐美的心理，我们应该用文学艺术的有力武器来改变这种错误的心理，而在中国人民中普遍建立起仇视美国、鄙视美国和蔑视美国的正确态度。
    四、和美国的腐败堕落的文化作斗争，是我们文学艺术界特别要负担起来的任务。所谓“美国生活方式”正是一种最腐败堕落的生活方式。它把人与人之间的关系简单地化成买卖关系，只有私人利害打算。美国的文化中充满了市侩主义与淫乱的颓风。世界资产阶级文化早已开始衰颓，现在是更明显地日益没落了。在华尔街金融寡头统治下的、从所谓“美国生活方式”产生的现代美国资产阶级文化，尤其彻头彻尾是市侩主义的、庸俗的、卑鄙的，缺乏创造性，缺乏崇高的理想。极大多数的美国人就是在这种“美国文化”中被欺骗，被麻醉。日益走向法西斯化的美国政府，施行了一连串的统制思想的法规，少数进步作家被囚禁、被迫害。美国文坛现在是魅魑横行，以淫邪凶杀为“勇敢”，以金钱崇拜为“人生观”，以低级趣味为技巧。为了保卫人类的文化与文艺的向上发展，我们也必须坚决反对美帝国主义。
    五、中华全国文学艺术界联合会号召文联所属各协及全国各地方文艺组织，一致行动起来，通过下列各种活动，广泛展开抗美援朝保家卫国的宣传运动：
    １、广泛动员作家写作，通过诗歌、活报、杂文、戏剧、电影、报告、小说、绘画、歌曲等形式作深入的普遍的宣传，特别要注意运用广大人民所最容易接受的图画、说唱、曲艺、活报、短剧等形式。
    ２、建议全国文艺报刊，经常地有系统地刊载有关抗美援朝的文章与作品，增加时事性的杂文。
    ３、建议全国各地文工团队、剧团进行抗美援朝的宣传，以活报、短剧、演唱、歌舞、曲艺等艺术形式向农村、工厂、部队进行抗美援朝的宣传活动。
    ４、组织及教育民间艺人，使他们也能积极而有效地参加这一宣传活动。通过他们来揭露并粉碎特务间谍分子所散布的无耻谣言。针对人民群众中一部分对美帝尚缺乏认识的各种观点，进行抗美援朝的鼓动宣传。
    ５、组织各种讲演会、座谈会、朗诵会。
    ６、广泛地与全世界各国爱好和平民主的文学艺术团体以及作家艺术家建立更进一步的联系、交换作品、共同为保卫世界和平反对美帝侵略而斗争。
