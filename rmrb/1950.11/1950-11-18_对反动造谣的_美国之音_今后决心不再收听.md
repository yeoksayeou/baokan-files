　　On the Reactionary Rumor-Spreading "Voice of America"
    I am Resolved to Stop Listening From Now On
    Xiao Darong, State-Operated No. 17 Cotton Mill
    The surging nationwide movement to resist America and aid Korea has enabled me to recognize the true face of American imperialism and strengthened my vigilance against American imperialist aggression. In particular, it has given me a correct understanding of the "Voice of America," the headquarters of American imperialist propaganda and rumor-mongering, and profoundly criticized my past mistakes.
    In the past, I listened to the "Voice of America" because I believed the rumors: "The Voice of America has more war news and it comes faster than the newspapers." Driven by curiosity, I started listening and thought it was indeed "not bad." For example, a few days ago, before the newspapers reported on the defeats of the American imperialists in Korea, the "Voice of America" had already reported it. Intentionally or unintentionally, I would pass on the "news" I heard to others, showing that I had "foresight" and was "well-informed," unknowingly becoming a prisoner of enemy propaganda in an objective sense.
    At that time, I still thought that the "Voice of America's" current affairs reports also had a "correct" side. I only saw its surface, but ignored the essence of American imperialist aggression. It turned out that in order to lure listeners in, when it could not avoid including some undeniable true material, it embellished it with a seemingly "impartial" attitude. In between these disguised "truths," it cleverly inserted some reports that distorted the facts, saying that China was "invading" and "interfering," etc., deceptive reports that made listeners believe it was true. This is the truth of the "Voice of America's" deception and rumor-mongering. Didn't the "Voice of America" say something like "The American army will not advance beyond the 38th parallel"? Didn't it say "The American army will stop at the 40th parallel"? Today's facts prove, what happened to these "correct" reports? If the current affairs reports are like this, other things are even more conceivable.
    In the past, I had thought about it and even defended myself to a few friends: I am standing on the people's side and listening to the "Voice of America" with a critical attitude, in order to analyze its rumors. Today, looking back, this is just deceiving myself. Not to mention whether we have such a firm stance and sharp analytical ability to avoid being numbed and poisoned by this "rumor-spreading voice," everyone who listens to the "Voice of America" can ask themselves: are we really listening with such an attitude? If we say that this is to better understand the development of the situation, that is even more self-deception. Today, the people's newspapers report all the facts truthfully, with analysis, explanations, and critiques. Isn't that enough to help and guide us to understand the situation? Moreover, it is also a significant waste of time. Why don't we use this precious spare time to read more progressive books, listen to more correct opinions, and do things that are beneficial to the people? Why do we have to obediently be prisoners of the American imperialist "war of nerves"?
    In addition, in the past, I also had another thought: the public security organs have not explicitly stipulated that we are prohibited from listening to the "Voice of America." It's not a crime to listen occasionally. Now, looking back, this is fundamentally wrong. Since we have recognized the rumor-mongering essence of the "Voice of America," recognized that it is the headquarters of the American imperialist aggression against our country's other form of "war of nerves," and recognized that it is the source of secret agent rumors, we should consciously and resolutely not listen to it, and respond to the boiling nationwide movement to resist America and aid Korea with action. Don't we even have the minimum level of self-respect of the Chinese people? Do we have to wait until the public security organs explicitly prohibit it before we stop listening?
    I have decided to stop listening to the "Voice of America" from now on, and I would like to tell everyone who is listening to the "Voice of America": if you don't want to be a prisoner of the propaganda of the American reactionary rulers, then don't listen to the "Voice of America" anymore!

### 对反动造谣的“美国之音”  今后决心不再收听

　　对反动造谣的“美国之音”
    今后决心不再收听
    国营十七棉纺厂  萧达荣
    汹涌全国的抗美援朝运动，使我认识了美帝的真实面貌，加强了我对美帝侵略的警惕。尤其使我对美帝宣传造谣的大本营——“美国之音”，有了正确的认识，深刻地批判了过去的错误。
    我在过去因为听信了别人的传说：“美国之音有许多战事消息要比报纸上来得快些。”便由于好奇心的驱使，开始听起来，觉得果然“不错”。譬如前几天报上还没有登出美帝在朝鲜吃败仗，“美国之音”里却早就报道出来了。有意无意之中，也就把听到的“消息”转告别人，表示自己有“先见之明”、“消息灵通”，不知不觉中在客观上做了一个敌人宣传的俘虏。
    这时，我还以为“美国之音”的时事报道也有“正确”的一面，只看见他的表面，而忽略了美帝侵略的本质。原来它为了要使收听者上钩，在不能不放进一部分无法掩盖的真实材料时，粉饰成俨然“公正”的态度，就在这些伪装的“真实”之间，就巧妙地插入一些歪曲事实的报道，说什么中国“侵略”“干涉”等等欺骗性的报道，使收听者也就信以为真。这便是“美国之音”欺骗造谣的真相。“美国之音”不是说过什么“到了三八线，美军不再前进了”？不是说过“美军到四○线为止”？今天的事实证明，这些“正确”的报道怎么样了？时事报道如此，其他更可想见。
    过去我曾经想过，也对几个朋友辩护过：我是站在人民的立场上，用批判的态度来听“美国之音”的，借以分析他的谣言。今天想来，这句话也仅仅是哄骗自己而已。先不说我们是否具有这样坚定的立场和锐利分析能力，能够不被这“造谣之音”所麻醉和毒害，每一个收听“美国之音”的人可以扪心自问：我们真是以这样的态度来收听的吗？假使我们说这是为了更多地了解时局的发展，那更是自欺欺人，今天人民的报纸所报道的都是千真万确的事实，有分析，有讲解，有说明，有批判，难道还不够帮助我们和指导我们来了解时局吗？何况在时间的消耗上，也是个重大的损失。我们为什么不把这一些宝贵的业余时间，来多看一些进步的书籍，听一些正确的言论，做一些有益于人民的事情呢？为什么偏偏要服服贴贴地做美帝“神经战”的俘虏呢？
    另外，我在过去，也还有一种想法：公安机关并没有明文规定，禁止我们收听“美国之音”呀，难得听听，也不是什么犯法事。现在想来，这是根本错误的。我们既然认识了“美国之音”的造谣本质，认识了它是美帝侵略我国的另一方式“神经战”的总司令部，认识了它是匪特造谣的来源，我们就应该自觉地坚决不收听，用行动来响应全国沸腾的抗美援朝运动才对，难道我们连最低程度的中国人民的自尊心也没有吗？难道一定要等到公安机关来明文禁止才不收听吗？
    我今后决定不再收听“美国之音”了，并愿意奉告所有收听“美国之音”的人们：假使你不愿意自己做一个美国反动统治者宣传的俘虏，你就不要再听“美国之音”吧！
