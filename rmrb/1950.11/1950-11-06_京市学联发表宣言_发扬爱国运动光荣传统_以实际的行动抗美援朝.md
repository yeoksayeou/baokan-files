　　Beijing Student Federation Issues Declaration
    Carry Forward the Glorious Tradition of the Patriotic Movement
    Take Practical Actions to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea
    [By Our Newspaper] The Beijing Student Federation, in response to the joint declaration of the democratic parties, issued the following declaration:

    The declaration issued by the democratic parties, vowing to fully support the just demands of the people of the whole country and to support the sacred task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to defend our homes and country on a voluntary basis, precisely represents the just demands of the 475 million people of China. The people of the whole country will be more clearly aware and greatly encouraged by this declaration. We, the students of Beijing, vow to uphold this just declaration with our iron will and are willing to fight for the goal of this declaration!

    From the series of provocative actions of U.S. imperialism against our country in the war of aggression against Korea, we deeply realize that U.S. imperialism is following the old path taken by the Japanese寇 when they invaded China, attempting to attack China through Korea. While launching the war of aggression against Korea, U.S. imperialism not only invaded and occupied our country's Taiwan, but also constantly violated our country's airspace and continued to encroach upon our country's borders. These facts fully prove that it is indeed our current most ferocious and brutal enemy. The Korean people are the close brothers of the Chinese people, Korea and China are closely linked, and we cannot ignore the U.S. imperialist aggression in Korea. Therefore, as the declaration points out: "The Chinese people's support for the Korean people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression is not only a moral responsibility, but also closely related to the vital interests of all our people, and is determined by the necessity of self-defense."

    The students of Beijing have always stood at the forefront of the anti-imperialist aggression movement. We have heroically carried out the "Protest Against U.S. Military Atrocities" and "Oppose the U.S. Support of Japan" movements. We have never forgotten and will never forget the crime of the U.S. imperialists raping our female student Shen Chong. We will also never forget the countless blood debts left by the U.S. imperialists in China. Moreover, we cannot tolerate these atrocities being inflicted on us again. We are full of anger, full of strength, and we will resolutely participate in the struggle of the people of the whole country to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea with our own practical actions!

    The Beijing students, with the glorious tradition of the patriotic movement, fully support the joint declaration of the democratic parties, and will bring the spirit of the declaration to the people of the city; we will do our best to make not only the students of the city, but also the people of the city and the people of the country, more united in understanding, and struggle for the sacred task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to defend our homes and country!

    Smash the aggression of American imperialism!
    Long live the victory of the Chinese and Korean people!

　　京市学联发表宣言
    发扬爱国运动光荣传统
    以实际的行动抗美援朝
    【本报讯】北京市学生联合会响应各民主党派联合宣言，发表宣言如下：
    各民主党派所发表的誓以全力拥护全国人民的正义要求，拥护全国人民在志愿基础上为着抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务而奋斗的宣言，正是代表中国四万七千五百万人民的正义要求，全国人民将因这一宣言得到更明确的认识与极大的鼓舞。我们北京市的学生誓以自己钢铁般的意志拥护这一正义的宣言，并愿为这个宣言的目标而奋斗！
    从美帝国主义在侵朝战争中对我国一连串的挑衅行为，我们深深认识美帝国主义正在走着日寇侵略中国所走过的老路，企图经过朝鲜进攻中国。美帝国主义发动侵朝战争的同时，不但侵占我国的台湾，而且不断地侵犯我国的领空，并向我国边境节节进逼。这些事实完全证明它实在是我们中国人民当前最凶狠残暴的敌人。朝鲜人民是中国人民的亲密兄弟，朝鲜与中国血肉相联，唇齿相依，我们对美帝国主义在朝鲜的侵略决不能置之不理。因此，正如宣言所指出：“中国人民支援朝鲜人民的抗美战争不止是道义上的责任，而且和我国全体人民的切身利害密切地关联着，是为自卫的必要性所决定的。”
    我们北京市学生一向是站在反对帝国主义侵略运动的最前面，我们曾经英勇地进行过“抗议美军暴行”和“反对美国扶植日本”的运动。我们至今未曾忘记也永远不会忘记美帝强奸我们女同学沈崇的罪行。我们也永不会忘记美帝在中国所留下的无数的血债。而且，我们更不能容忍这些暴行再一次加到我们的身上。我们充满愤恨，充满力量，我们要以自己的实际行动来坚决地参加全国人民抗美援朝的斗争的行列！
    有着爱国运动光荣传统的北京学生完全拥护各民主党派的联合宣言，并且要将宣言的精神带到全市人民中去；我们要尽自己最大的努力来使得不仅全市同学，而且全市人民、全国人民在认识上更加一致起来，团结起来，为抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务而奋斗！
    粉碎美国帝国主义的侵略！
    中朝两国人民胜利万岁！
    北京市学生联合会
    一九五○、十一、五．
