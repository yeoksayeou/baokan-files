　　An Appeal to Americans of Conscience
    S. Shapiro
    Editor's Note: The author of this article is an American residing abroad. He wrote this article after watching the Korean documentary "An Appeal to People of Conscience All Over the World."
    Fellow Americans:

    I recently saw a Korean documentary that imperialists would never let you see. But you must know this film, because it records almost unbelievable bestial crimes—crimes directly and indirectly created by Americans.

    Part of the material in this film comes from the U.S. Information Service in Seoul. It begins by showing the greedy hand of the Wall Street tycoons. We can see Dulles—legal counsel for several of America's largest corporations, and also legal counsel for the Schroeder Bank, which financially supported Hitler's Germany—arriving in Seoul a few days before the attack on North Korea. The puppet Syngman Rhee follows at his side. Dulles and some senior officers showed great interest in the military map spread out before him as they inspected war preparations along the 38th parallel. He peered north through binoculars.

    We also see scenes from concentration camps—hastily abandoned after the invaders were pushed back. This once again recalls the Nazi atrocities. In terrifying pits, the bodies of thousands of Korean patriots are buried; corpses are constantly washed ashore by the sea. These are the bodies of people who were brutally dismembered and thrown alive into the sea while tied up.

    One scene after another shows American planes carrying out violent bombing raids on the Korean people for hours on end. Schools far from military targets, nurseries, clearly marked hospitals, churches, and residential areas are burned and collapsed into blackened ruins.

    Civilians are mercilessly strafed. In small villages, on country paths, in the fields, the bodies of men, women, and children lie everywhere. Women weep bitterly beside the corpses of their dead babies. Children stare at the sky in terror. Overhead, American planes circle, swoop, and search for more human targets for their cold-blooded machine guns. The massacre is massive. In the past few months alone, the disasters caused by the American Air Force in Korea have been greater than those caused by the Japanese in the past thirty-six years.

    I feel heartbroken and ashamed at the same time. I am heartbroken by the American aggressors' barbaric acts of destruction against a peaceful people—which were premeditated, the facts are too obvious; I am ashamed that Americans have become butchers who slaughter innocent people. I am ashamed not only for the Americans in uniform in Korea, but also for the deceived Americans at home who are unmoved by the atrocities of the American military in Korea!

    The taxes you pay have been used to buy weapons to slaughter those who love freedom. Many of you have carelessly participated in elections, or have not opposed those unscrupulous politicians who are intensifying a vicious foreign policy. Your contempt for international justice has made the United States the most hated country in the world. Your inaction at home has allowed a small group of tycoons and madmen to drag our country into the abyss of fascism!

    Don't say you didn't know. This is what the Germans said when they faced the defeated Nazis' gas chambers and crematoria. You must know, you also have a responsibility to know, because you bear the ultimate responsibility. Think about who is manipulating you, blinding your eyes, and driving America into tyranny!

    I appeal to you: wake up and fight, overthrow the warmongering fascists! We cannot tolerate this darkness and bloodshed. Remove the germs that are corroding the soul of our country, and establish a truly democratic America, so that she can be with the peace-loving and democratic countries of the world!

　　告有良心的美国人
    Ｓ·沙博理
    编者按：这篇文章的作者是一位美侨。他在看了朝鲜记录影片《告全世界有良心的人们》后写了这篇文章。美国同胞们：
    我最近看到了一部朝鲜的记录片，那是帝国主义者决不会让你们看到的。但是，你们必须晓得这部片子，因为它记录着叫人几乎不能相信的野兽般的罪行——美国人直接和间接制造出来的罪行。
    这部影片的一部分材料系得自汉城美国新闻处。这里面一开头就显示出华尔街财阀们贪婪地操纵着的魔手。我们可以看见杜勒斯——美国几个最大公司的法律顾问，同时也是在财政上资助希特勒的德国希罗德银行的法律顾问，在向北朝鲜发动进攻的前几天到了汉城。傀儡李承晚追随在他的身侧。杜勒斯和一些高级军官在三八线上视察战争的准备工作时，对摊开在他面前的那张军事地图表示了很大的兴趣。他从望远镜里窥视着北方。
    我们又看到了集中营的情景——那是在侵略者被反击后匆促放弃的。这又一次使人忆起了纳粹的暴行。在可怖的深坑中，埋着成千的朝鲜爱国者的尸体；死尸不断被海水冲到海岸上来。这都是被残酷地肢解和活生生地绑着抛进海里去的人们的尸体。
    一个镜头接着一个镜头，美国飞机连续几小时地对朝鲜人民施行狂暴的轰炸。远离军事目标的学校、托儿所、标帜显明的医院、教堂和住宅区，焚烧倒坍在熏黑的废墟上。
    平民受到无情的扫射。在小村庄里，在乡村小径上，在田野中，到处躺着男女和儿童的尸体。妇女们在她们死去的婴儿尸体旁边悲痛地号哭。孩子们恐怖地凝视着天空。头上，美国飞机在盘旋，在俯冲，在给他们杀人不眨眼的机关枪找寻更多的肉靶子。屠杀是大规模的。就在过去几个月中，美国空军在朝鲜所制造的灾难比日本人在过去三十六年中所造的还多。
    我一方面感到痛心，一方面感到羞耻。我痛心于美国侵略者对于和平人民的野蛮破坏行为——那是经过预谋的，事实是太明显了；我羞耻于美国人成为残害无辜人民的屠夫。我不仅为在朝鲜穿着制服的美国人羞耻，我也为国内被欺骗的、对美军在朝鲜的暴行无所动心的美国人感到羞耻！
    你们缴纳的税款曾被用来购买武器去屠杀那些爱好自由的人民。你们之中有许多人曾不费心思地参加选举，或者不反对那些狼心狗肺的政客——他们正在加紧实行一种恶毒的外交政策。由于你们藐视国际正义，已使得美国变成全世界最可憎的国家。你们在国内的怠惰使一小撮财阀和疯子把我们的国家拖进法西斯主义的深渊里去！
    不要说你们不知道。这是德国人面对着战败了的纳粹的毒气室和焚尸炉时所说的话。你们必须知道，你们也有责任要知道，因为你们要负最后的责任。想一想吧，究竟谁在播弄你们，蒙蔽住你们的眼睛，把美国驱到暴政中去！
    我向你们呼吁：觉醒起来战斗吧，打倒战争贩子法西斯分子！我们对于这种黑暗和血腥的事实是不能忍耐下去的。把腐蚀我们国家灵魂的毒菌清除吧，建立真正民主的美国，使她能和全世界爱好和平民主的国家在一起！
