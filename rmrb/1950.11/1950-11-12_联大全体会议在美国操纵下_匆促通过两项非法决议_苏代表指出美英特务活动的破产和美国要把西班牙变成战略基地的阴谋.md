　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, 6th: A comprehensive TASS dispatch from New York: The United Nations General Assembly held plenary sessions on November 3rd and 4th.
　　The November 3rd session discussed the proposal passed by the American-British majority in the Special Political Committee, which slandered Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania for so-called "violations of human rights."
　　Soviet representative Zarubin stated: This is a new attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania in violation of the United Nations Charter. These countries are resolutely following the path of genuine democratic development, and sacredly defending the rights and fundamental freedoms of their people. American-British attempts to exert political pressure on these countries will not produce any results, nor will they succeed in diverting public attention from the bankrupt subversive activities of American-British espionage agencies in these countries. Further discussion of this slanderous issue will endanger the United Nations, constitute a new violation of the Charter, and worsen relations between countries. Therefore, the Soviet delegation will vote against this proposal. Representatives from Poland and Czechoslovakia also spoke against this illegal proposal.
　　However, the American-British majority, disregarding the opposition of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, hastily concluded the debate and used the voting machine to pass this draft resolution. The result of the vote was forty in favor, five against (Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia), and twelve abstentions (India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Liberia, Yemen, Iraq, Egypt, etc.). The Ukrainian representative issued a statement after the vote: This action of hastily passing this illegal resolution without allowing full discussion insults the United Nations and diminishes its prestige. The Ukrainian delegation does not recognize this illegal resolution.
　　The November 4th session discussed the proposal, manipulated by the United States and passed by the majority in the Special Political Committee, to revoke the General Assembly's 1946 resolution recommending that member states withdraw their diplomatic envoys from Spain and prohibiting Franco's Spain from participating in the specialized agencies of the United Nations.
　　Despite the opposition of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, the American-British majority decided not to engage in a general debate on this issue, but to proceed directly to a vote on the draft resolution.
　　Before the vote, Soviet representative Yarujian stated that there was no justification for revoking the 1946 resolution, as Spain was still ruled by the Franco fascist regime. Polish representative Suchi pointed out that the real reason for revoking the 1946 resolution was the United States' hope to turn Spain into a military strategic base and a reliable puppet. The reason the United States is attempting to hastily pass this proposal is to avoid being condemned by world opinion. Representatives from Ukraine, Czechoslovakia, Belarus, and Uruguay also spoke against this proposal.
　　However, under the manipulation of the United States, the majority voting machine in the General Assembly hastily passed this proposal, with thirty-eight votes in favor (including the United States), ten votes against (Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Guatemala, Israel, Mexico, Uruguay, and Yugoslavia), and twelve abstentions (United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway, New Zealand, Indonesia, India, France, Abyssinia, Denmark, Burma, Australia, and Cuba).

　　苏代表指出美英特务活动的破产和美国要把西班牙变成战略基地的阴谋
    【新华社六日讯】综合塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会于十一月三、四日举行全体会议。
    三日会议讨论特别政治委员会美英多数派所通过的诽谤保加利亚、匈牙利和罗马尼亚所谓“破坏人权”的提案。
    苏联代表查鲁宾发言指出：这是违反联合国宪章干涉保、匈、罗三国内政的新企图。这些国家正坚决地走着真正民主发展的道路，神圣地保卫着它们人民的权利和基本自由。美英企图对这些国家施用政治压力并不能得出任何结果，分散群众对于美英特务机关在这些国家里的破产了的颠复性的活动的注意力，也已告失败。如果再要讨论这个诽谤性的问题，就会危害联合国，会成为对宪章的新破坏，会恶化各国间的关系。因此苏联代表团将投票反对这个提案。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克代表也发言反对这个非法的提案。
    但是，美英多数派竟不顾苏联及人民民主国家的反对，匆匆结束辩论并利用表决机器通过了这一决议草案。表决结果有四十票赞成，五票反对（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克），十二票弃权（印度、印尼、巴基斯坦、沙特阿拉伯、利比里亚、也门、伊拉克、埃及等国）。乌克兰代表在表决后发表声明：这种不允许充分讨论即草率通过这个非法决议的行动，侮辱了联合国并降低了它的威信。乌克兰代表团不承认这个非法决议。
    四日会议讨论美国操纵特别政治委员会中多数所通过的取消联大一九四六年关于建议各会员国撤回其驻西班牙的外交使节以及不许佛朗哥西班牙参加联合国各专门机构的决议提案。
    在苏联及人民民主国家的反对下，美英多数竟决定不就这一问题展开一般辩论，即径行表决决议草案。
    在表决以前，苏联代表亚鲁疆发言指出，取消一九四六年的决议是毫无理由的，西班牙仍就由佛朗哥法西斯政权统治着。波兰代表苏琪指出：取消一九四六年的决议的真实原因，是美国希望把西班牙变成军事战略基地，变成它的可靠奴仆。美国所以企图匆促通过这个提案，就是害怕引起世界舆论的谴责。乌克兰、捷克斯洛伐克、白俄罗斯及乌拉圭代表均发言反对这一提案。
    然而，在美国操纵下，大会内的多数表决机器匆匆通过了这一提案，表决时美国等三十八票赞成，十票反对（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、危地马拉、以色列、墨西哥、乌拉圭及南斯拉夫），十二票弃权（英国、瑞典、挪威、新西兰、印尼、印度、法国、阿比西尼亚、丹麦、缅甸、澳大利亚及古巴）。
