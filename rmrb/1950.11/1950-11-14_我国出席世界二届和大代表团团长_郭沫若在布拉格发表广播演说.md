Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 13th: Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation to the Second World Congress of Defenders of Peace, delivered a radio address on Prague Radio on the 12th, protesting the British government's shameless obstruction of the congress's convening in Sheffield and welcoming the Polish people's invitation to meet in Warsaw. The full text of the speech is as follows:

　　We Chinese people love peace. Two hundred and five million people have already signed the Stockholm Appeal. But peace has true and false forms. Aggressors also habitually use "peace" as sugar-coating to disguise their aggression. American imperialism is currently launching a war of aggression in Asia, invading our neighbor Korea, and forcibly occupying our territory of Taiwan, but Truman says that this is for "peace" in Asia. We Chinese people deeply know that the so-called "peace" in the mouths of aggressors is actually enslavement and aggression. We Chinese people have waged more than a century of continuous bloody struggle against aggression. We Chinese people deeply know that to defend true peace, we must oppose all the conspiracies and tricks of the aggressors. We have gained a new test of this historical experience in the unfolding of the Stockholm Appeal signature campaign.

　　China began the Stockholm Appeal signature campaign on May 1st. In the first two months, May and mid-June, only 26.71 million people signed. But in the subsequent three months, from early July to the end of September, there was a sudden and rapid increase of nearly ten times. What is the reason for this? This is because American imperialism launched a war of aggression at the end of June, which further stimulated the sense of responsibility of the Chinese people to defend peace in Asia and world peace, and therefore the reaction was completely different.

　　Defending peace requires opposing aggression; this is the unanimous understanding of the Chinese people. Therefore, our Chinese Peace Delegation has been entrusted by the Chinese people to attend the Second World Congress of Defenders of Peace, and will mainly present the following demands to the congress:

　　(1) Stop the war of aggression against Korea by the United States and other countries, demand the withdrawal of all foreign aggressor troops from Korea, and achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. This should be the central key to the current struggle to defend world peace.

　　(2) Demand that the United States immediately stop any interference in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan.

　　(3) Demand that MacArthur be declared a war-monger. He is the main instigator of the war of aggression in the Far East and the main instigator of expanding the Korean War into a world war.

　　In addition, we also demand the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons and suggest that all countries in the world simultaneously reduce armaments, and that the people of all countries provide mutual assistance in economic and cultural construction in peaceful life.

　　Now, the Second World Congress of Defenders of Peace has been shamelessly obstructed by the British government and cannot be convened in Sheffield, England. This was something we expected. The British government is a servant of American imperialism. It has long been waging a barbaric war in Malaya, and is currently the main accomplice of the United States in the Korean War. Since British imperialism is an enemy of peace, it is naturally afraid of peace and obstructs the peace movement of peace-loving people all over the world. The British government's obstruction and sabotage of the World Congress of Defenders of Peace is shameful, despicable, and foolish. Its obstruction and sabotage have not damaged the peace movement in the slightest. It just proves the magnitude of the peace forces, which makes the big and small warmongers tremble with fear, and therefore they can only hysterically scratch their own faces.

　　The fact that the Peace Congress cannot be held in Sheffield has exposed the face of the British government, making the British people and the people of the world know that the British government does not welcome peace, but needs war. This is by no means our failure, but the failure of the enemies of peace. We do not need to expose the British government's mask; it has exposed itself.

　　The London fog cannot cover the sunshine that illuminates the earth. Although the Second World Congress of Defenders of Peace cannot be held in Sheffield, it can be held anywhere else in the free world. Now that the Polish people welcome us to Warsaw, we are very happy. We can even more happily and freely consider, together with our comrades-in-arms around the world who are fighting for true peace, all the specific plans and steps to oppose aggression and defend peace. The peace-loving British people can take this opportunity to further recognize the face of the Labour government. They will surely be able to concentrate their strength to push the British peace movement to a higher stage.

　　Long live the victory of world peace!

　　我国出席世界二届和大代表团团长
    郭沫若在布拉格发表广播演说
    伦敦的迷雾不能蒙罩普照大地的阳光。英国政府的阻挠和破坏，并不曾损及和平运动的分毫，恰恰证明和平力量的浩大，使大大小小的战争贩子们害怕得发抖。                                                  
    【新华社布拉格十三日电】中国出席第二届世界保卫和平大会代表团团长郭沫若，于十二日在布拉格电台发表广播演说，抗议英国政府无耻地阻挠大会在设菲尔德召开，并对波兰人民的邀请前往华沙开会表示欢迎。演词全文如下：
    我们中国人民是爱好和平的，在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上已经有二万万零五百万人签了名。但是和平有真假之分。侵略者也惯爱以“和平”为糖衣来掩饰他的侵略。美帝国主义目前正在亚洲发动侵略战争，侵略我们的邻邦朝鲜，强占我们的领土台湾，但是杜鲁门却在说这是为了亚洲的“和平”。我们中国人民深切地知道：侵略者口中的所谓“和平”，实际上就是奴役，就是侵略。我们中国人民为了反对侵略，曾经作了一百年以上的连续不断的流血斗争。我们中国人民深切地知道：要保卫真正的和平，必须反对侵略者的一切阴谋诡计。这一个历史的经验，我们在斯德哥尔摩宣言签名运动的展开上，又得到了一次新的检验。
    中国是在五月一日开始斯德哥尔摩宣言签名运动的。在开始的两个月即五月与六月中，仅仅得到二千六百七十一万人的签名。但在后来三个月，即七月初至九月底却突飞猛晋地增加了将近十倍。这是什么原故呢？这是因为美帝国主义在六月底发动了侵略战争，更加刺激了我们中国人民保卫亚洲和平和世界和平的责任感，因而反应便完全不同了。
    保卫和平必须反对侵略，这是我们中国人民一致的认识。因此，我们中国和平代表团这次来参加第二届世界保卫和平大会，受了中国人民的委托，主要将向大会提出这样的一些要求：
    （一）制止美国和其它国家侵略朝鲜的战争，要求从朝鲜撤退一切外国侵略军，实现朝鲜问题的和平解决。这应该是当前保卫世界和平斗争的中心关键。
    （二）要求美国立即停止对于中国人民解放台湾的任何干涉。
    （三）要求宣布麦克阿瑟为战争贩子。他是远东侵略战争的主要制造者，和将朝鲜战争扩大为世界战争的主要煽动者。
    此外，我们同样也要求禁止原子武器的使用，并建议世界各国同时裁减军备，各国人民在和平生活中作经济文化建设上的相互协助。
    现在第二届世界保卫和平大会，受到了英国政府的无耻的阻挠，而不能够在英国设菲尔德召开了。这本来是我们意料中的事。英国政府是美帝国主义的仆从，它早在马来亚进行着野蛮的战争，目前在朝鲜战争中又是美国主要的帮凶。英帝国主义既然是和平的敌人，它当然是害怕和平、并阻挠全世界爱好和平的人民的和平运动的。英国政府对于世界保卫和平大会的阻挠和破坏是可耻的、卑鄙的和愚蠢的，它的阻挠和破坏，并不曾损及和平运动的分毫，恰恰证明了和平力量的浩大，使大大小小的战争贩子们害怕得发抖，因而只好歇斯底里地抓破自己的面皮了。
    不能在设菲尔德召开和平大会，这样就揭露了英国政府的面貌，使英国人民和全世界人民都知道：英国政府是不欢迎和平，而是需要战争的。这决不是我们的失败，而是和平的敌人的失败。英国政府的假面具不用我们去揭露，它自己就揭露了。
    伦敦的迷雾是不能蒙罩普照大地的阳光的。第二届世界保卫和平大会虽然不能在设菲尔德召开，但在别的自由的天地里，随处都是可以召开的。现在波兰人民欢迎我们到华沙去，我们非常高兴。我们更可以痛快而且自由地和全世界为真正的和平而斗争的战友们一道，来考虑反对侵略和保卫和平的一切具体的方案和步骤了。爱好和平的英国人民借着这个机会，更可以认清工党政府的面貌。他们一定能够集中力量来把英国和平运动推到更高的阶段。
    世界和平的胜利万岁！
