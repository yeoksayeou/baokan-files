　　Shanxi's Licheng, Jincheng, Wuxiang, Huguan, and Xiangyuan Counties
    Most Villages Exceed Pre-War Production Levels
    Land Reform Has Increased Farmers' Enthusiasm for Production
    Mutual Aid Teams Have Demonstrated the High Efficiency of Collective Labor
    [This Newspaper's Report] Many villages in Licheng, Jincheng, Wuxiang, Huguan, and Xiangyuan counties in Shanxi Province have seen their agricultural products exceed pre-war levels this year. Farmers are now taking practical actions to increase production, strengthen national defense, and safeguard their good lives.

    Licheng County has a total of 362,000 mu of cultivated land, and this year's total grain harvest was 394,200 shi, exceeding the planned amount by more than 2,000 shi, and an increase of 81,500 shi compared to last year. The harvest of ginned cotton was 281,800 jin, exceeding the original plan by 93,400 jin, and an increase of 139,700 jin compared to last year. The total grain and cotton production exceeded pre-war levels by 31 percent. This year's grain and cotton production, in addition to supplying the county's farmers for food and paying agricultural taxes, has a surplus of 127,700 jin. Through land reform and the Great Production Movement, the county's production reached pre-war levels in 1947.

    The 200-plus labor models in Jincheng wrote in a letter to Chairman Mao: "Under your wise leadership, our county's production this year has exceeded pre-war levels. Before the war, the average yield per mu in our county was 1 shi and 1 dou and 7 sheng (municipal shi). This year, the average yield per mu is 1 shi and 3 dou, exceeding pre-war levels by 1 dou and 3 sheng. The county's total grain production increased by 122,000 shi, exceeding the original plan (47,000 shi) by 75,000 shi. The lives of farmers throughout the county have improved." The letter also stated: "Our county has made great improvements in farming techniques. This year, in addition to exceeding pre-war operating levels in terms of applying fertilizer, hoeing, harrowing, and plowing, we have also paid special attention to promoting improved varieties and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests. This year, a total of more than 186,000 mu of land in the county has adopted improved varieties, accounting for more than 43 percent of the county's total cultivated land area. Many farmers selected seeds during the wheat harvest; seed selection was even more common during the autumn harvest." They also excitedly reported to Chairman Mao: "Our county's livestock and farm implements have increased significantly. Our county suffered greatly from the devastation of the Japanese invaders and Yan's bandit troops. Livestock was taken away and farm implements were destroyed. Now, the number of livestock has increased from 10,000 at the time of liberation to the current 40,680; the number of farm implements has also increased to more than 61,000." The letter also reported on the achievements made in forestry, water conservancy, and cooperatives.

    In Wuxiang County, due to the improvement of agricultural techniques, the production volume in most villages exceeded pre-war levels, while a small number of villages reached pre-war levels. This year, many mutual aid teams in the county were reorganized from existing foundations. In terms of cultivation, they have earnestly achieved intensive cultivation and fertilization. Last year, land cultivated twice accounted for 55 percent, and land cultivated three times accounted for 34 percent. This year, land cultivated three times has reached 65 percent. More than 70 percent of the county soaked and mixed seeds with medicine and replaced varieties. These improved technologies and the promotion of improved varieties have played a huge role in increasing production. According to a survey of nine typical mutual aid teams, the average yield per mu increased by 1 dou and 4 sheng compared to last year, and exceeded pre-war levels by 5 dou and 3 sheng.

    Huguan County completed the plan to increase production by one dou this year. The county has a total of 190 administrative villages. Among them, 163 villages have exceeded pre-war production levels, 23 villages have reached pre-war levels, and only 4 villages have not yet reached pre-war levels. According to an actual survey of eight villages, including Hanzhuang and Guobao in the first category, Xiushan, Dongjingcen, Shenhou, and Hedeng in the second category, and Dashannan and Xiwangzhai in the third category, the average yield this year exceeded last year by 22.2 percent and exceeded pre-war levels by 17 percent. In Shili Village, led by Xiang Tishui, the output this year exceeded the pre-war level by 60 percent; the output of the mutual aid groups of Feng Haike and Ma Fujiao both exceeded pre-war levels by more than double. Farmers are living better and better lives, and every household has surplus grain.

    The 283 labor models in Xiangyuan County wrote to Chairman Mao to report on this year's production achievements. They said: "We gathered together to summarize the production situation for the whole year. The county's total grain production increased by 85,600 shi, exceeding the original plan of 81,000 shi. Among the 148 villages in the county, 25 villages have exceeded pre-war production levels, 108 villages have reached pre-war levels, and 15 villages are close to pre-war levels. 58.3 percent of the county's labor force has participated in mutual aid teams; 70 percent of women have participated in major labor, ensuring the realization of this year's production increase." All the labor models in the county assured Chairman Mao: "We must organize according to your words, improve production methods, increase production, and strive for a wealthier life." They also guaranteed: "We will fully support our Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army who are fighting against U.S. imperialism in Korea."

    The main reasons why the aforementioned counties have achieved such agricultural production successes are: First, after land reform, the issuance of land certificates confirmed land ownership, social order was stable, the enthusiasm of the masses for production was high, and they actively demanded to improve their lives. Second, the strong leadership of local Party and government. This year, the branch party members in general villages have played a leading and promoting role in production. They actively publicized production policies, led the masses to organize, cultivated intensively and meticulously, improved technology, and prevented and controlled diseases and insect pests. Third, organization. Mutual aid teams have not only exerted the high efficiency of collective labor, but also gathered wisdom and improved farming methods. For example, many mutual aid teams in Wuxiang County not only applied fertilizer in large quantities and of good quality, but also used it in combination according to the nature of the fertilizer and the nature of the soil. Fourth, cooperatives have become the center of economic activity in rural areas, adjusting surpluses and shortages, and playing a significant role in agricultural production. For example, Jincheng County currently has 178 cooperatives with more than 69,000 members and a capital of more than 1.32 million jin of millet. From January to September this year, it supplied farmers with production tools worth more than 40.52 million yuan; it also sold a lot of agricultural and sideline products and supplied farmers with daily necessities. More women participating in labor and farmers improving farm implements have also played a huge role in increasing production.

　　山西黎城晋城武乡壶关襄垣等五县
    大部村庄产量超过战前水平
    土地改革提高了农民的生产积极性
    互助组发挥了集体劳动的高度效能
    【本报讯】山西省黎城、晋城、武乡、壶关、襄垣等县不少村今年农产品均已超过战前水平。农民们现在以积极生产的实际行动，以增加国防力量，保卫自己的好生活。
    黎城全县三十六万二千亩耕地，今年共收粮三十九万四千二百余石，超过计划二千多石，比去年增产八万一千五百石。收皮棉二十八万一千八百斤，超过原计划九万三千四百斤，比去年增产十三万九千七百斤。总计粮棉产量超过战前百分之三十一。今年所产粮棉除供全县农民食用及缴纳农业税外，尚余十二万七千七百余斤。经过土地改革及大生产运动，该县在一九四七年产量即已达战前水平。
    晋城二百余名劳动模范在给毛主席上书时写道：在您的英明领导下，今年我们全县生产量已超过战前水平。我县战前每亩平均产量为一石一斗七升（市石），今年每亩平均产量为一石三斗，超过了战前一斗三升。全县共增产十二万二千石粮，超过原计划（四万七千石）七万五千石。全县农民的生活都上升了。信中又写道：我县在耕作技术上有很大改进，今年除在上粪、锄、耙、犁等方面均超过战前操作水平外，还特别注意了推广优良品种和防除病虫害。今年全县采用优良品种的共十八万六千余亩土地，占全县总耕地面积的百分之四十三强。麦收时农民选种者极多；秋收时选种者更为普遍。他们更兴奋地报告毛主席说：我县的牲畜与农具均增加很多。我县曾遭日寇与阎匪军的极大摧残，牲畜被牵走，农具被破坏。现在，牲畜已由刚解放时的一万头增加到现在的四万零六百八十头；农具也增加到六万一千余件。信中并报告了在林业、水利和合作社等方面获得的成绩。
    武乡县由于农业技术的提高，大部村庄的生产量超过了战前水平，小部村庄则达到了战前水平。今年该县不少互助组都是从原有基础上重新组织起来的。在耕作方面切实做到了加工加肥、多耕多锄。去年该县耕二遍地的占百分之五十五，耕三遍的占百分之三十四，今年耕三遍的已达到百分之六十五。该县浸拌种籽、使用药剂、与调换品种，达到百分之七十以上。这些改进技术和推广良种对提高生产起着巨大作用。据九个典型互助组的调查，平均每亩比去年增产一斗四升，超过战前五斗三升。
    壶关县今年完成增产一斗的计划。全县共一百九十个行政村。其中有一百六十三个村的产量超过战前水平，二十三个村达到战前水平，尚未达到战前水平的只有四个村。据一类村的韩庄、郭堡，二类村的修善、东井岑、神后、禾登，三类村的大山南、西王宅等八个村的实际调查，今年平均产量超过去年百分之二十二点二，超过战前百分之十七。向提水领导的十里村，今年产量超过战前水平百分之六十；冯海科、马富蛟两互助组的产量，均超过战前一倍以上。农民的日子越过越好，家家有了余粮。
    襄垣县二百八十三位劳动模范上书毛主席报告今年生产成绩。他们说：我们集聚在一堂，总结了全年生产情况。全县共增产粮八万五千六百石，超过原订计划八万一千石。全县一百四十八个村中，有二十五个村的产量超过了战前水平，一百零八个村达到战前水平，十五个村接近战前水平。该县百分之五十八点三的劳动力已参加了互助组；百分之七十的妇女已参加了主要劳动，保证了今年增产的实现。该县全体劳模向毛主席保证：一定按照您的话组织起来，改良生产方法，提高产量，为走向更富裕的生活而奋斗。他们并保证：全力支援向美帝进行斗争的我援朝志愿部队及朝鲜人民军。
    上述各县农业生产能获得如此成绩的主要原因是：首先，经过土地改革，填发土地证确定了地权，社会秩序安定，群众生产情绪高涨，积极要求改善生活。其次，各地党与政府的坚强领导。今年一般村的支部党员在生产中均起了带头与推动作用。他们积极宣传生产政策，领导群众组织起来，精耕细作，改良技术，与防除病虫害。第三，组织起来。互助组不仅发挥了集体劳动的高度效能，且能集思广益改进耕作方法。如武乡县不少互助组不仅在施肥上做到量多质好，且能根据肥料性质及土壤性质配合使用。第四，合作社在农村中已成为经济活动的中心，调剂有无，对农业生产起了不小作用。如晋城县现有一百七十八个合作社，社员六万九千多人，资金一百三十二万余斤小米。今年一至九月共供给农民生产用具价值四万零五百二十余万元；推销农副业产品和供应农民日常生活必需品也很多。更多的妇女参加劳动和农民改良农具等，也在提高生产方面起了巨大作用。（路际通、晋城县人民政府、王廷俊、李纯仁、马超骏、韩瑞锦、郭增基、襄垣全体劳模）
