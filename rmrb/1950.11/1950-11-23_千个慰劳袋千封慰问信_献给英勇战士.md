　　A Thousand Comfort Bags, A Thousand Letters of Condolence
    Dedicated to the Heroic Soldiers
    Tsinghua University Trade Union Cultural and Educational Committee
    A Thousand Comfort Bags
    In the upsurge of resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding our homes, and defending our country, starting from the 4th of October, the Tsinghua University Trade Union and the Women's Association initiated a movement to make comfort bags and write letters of condolence.
    As soon as the notices from the Trade Union and the Women's Association were posted, they immediately received enthusiastic response and support.
    The notice read: Strive for a thousand bags. A few dozen bags from one person is not much; several dozen people contributing to one bag is not little. Donate as much as your ability allows. Concretely express our love for the Korean People's Army and our volunteer troops, and our infinite hatred for American imperialism.
    Based on suggestions from members, the Trade Union and the Women's Association specified the dimensions of the comfort bags. They also requested: Write the donor's name and workplace on the outside of the bag. Include a letter of condolence in each comfort bag; the letter should be short and enthusiastic, and does not need to be sealed. Separate the bags for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army; do not mix them. Do not include easily damaged items as comfort items; the best comfort items are winter supplies and daily necessities, such as towels, gloves, underwear, etc. Submit the bags before the 19th; a thousand bags is the working goal, but do not simply pursue numbers and there should be no hint of coercion.
    The third grassroots group of the administrative unit was the first to quickly start the work. Everyone contributed as much money as possible according to their own circumstances. They organized a working team in the group meeting, dividing the work: some collected money, some bought comfort items, some sewed bags, and some wrote letters of condolence. Everyone worked happily and diligently.
    Soon, the Trade Union office was filled with all kinds of colorful bags. Deep blue, red, black, white. The comrades of the registration group all used blue, writing standardized artistic characters that were both generous and beautiful. Fifteen members of the Biology Department donated forty-three bags; each bag was affixed with a red star, which was both neat and solemn. The bags from the housewives were very detailed, embroidered with beautiful flowers or red five-pointed stars.
    The deadline for submitting the bags was the 19th, but on the afternoon of the 18th, the members happily brought the comfort items to the Trade Union.
    The members forgot that the 19th was Sunday. On this day, the Trade Union office was more lively than ever before, there were more people than ever before, and everyone was working hard like never before. Starting at 9 am, members continuously brought comfort bags to the Trade Union. The responsible comrades of the Trade Union were busy accepting, registering, and counting.

            Meticulous Care
    The original plan was for a thousand bags, but one thousand one hundred and twenty bags have already been received, exceeding the original number.
    The victory in mere numbers is not enough to depict the meticulous care contained in the comfort bags.
    The housewives, fearing that the soldiers' clothes might be torn and they would not find needles and thread, put needles and thread in some of the bags. Some put a roll of yarn in the bag, so that it could be used as a patching material if the gloves were torn.
    Hoping that the volunteer troops would strive to become glorious Communist Party members in battle, a comrade from the Department of Architecture donated a copy of the Party Constitution in the bag.
    Lin Huiyin personally made a camel hair cotton vest, saying: "I hope it can give warmth to the Korean People's Army soldiers in the cold weather."
    Jiang Zaifen sent the stamps she had collected from the past year since liberation to the volunteer troops, because from the stamps of this year, they could recall the great achievements of our People's Republic of China.
    We counted all the bags, every piece of cloth, every stitch, every thread, every comfort item, all showing the comrades' meticulous design and infinite care.
    Poems and Letters
    The letters or poems attached to the comfort bags, word for word, were full of unparalleled enthusiasm, kindness, and expressions of love and admiration. On the other hand, the hatred for American imperialism, every sentence, every word, far surpassed the power of the atomic bomb!
    Professor Hua Luogeng specially attached a poem in the comfort bag, praising the bravery of the People's Army and the volunteer troops, and used this to pay tribute to the heroes.
    Professor Yan Renyin said in his letter: "We guarantee to teach the books well and help the government solve the problems of national defense and production. Comrades! March forward with peace of mind! Leave the affairs at home to us, don't worry about anything, we look forward to your early triumphant return." Professor Liu Xianzhu wrote: "I hope you will help the Korean friendly army and quickly defeat the barbaric invading army. When you return to Beijing, we will definitely prepare a grand welcome for you." Professor Duan Xuefu also said: "My meager gift is not enough to express my respect for you, the pocket was made by my 69-year-old mother herself."
    Zhou Xieqing wrote in her letter: "My five-year-old daughter, seeing that seven comfort bags were prepared at home, anxiously said: 'Mom, why can everyone else give gifts to the volunteer soldiers, but I don't have any? The teacher said: the American soldiers are really bad, they will bully our children, thanks to the volunteer soldiers who drove them away. I also want to give gifts.' I promised to write her name on the comfort bag, and she was satisfied. She also said: 'When I grow up, I will also be a volunteer soldier, other people's mothers will love me like this, make me new gloves, and buy me good things.' From this, it can be seen what the world thinks of your righteous actions. Advance bravely, we will always support you!" Mr. Yang from the Department of Geology said: "I am the mother of a seven-month-old baby. Now that the American imperialists have launched this shameful aggression, I immediately realized the seriousness of the matter. Although I love my child, when the country needs it, I will go to the front line and fight with you. I can shoot guns in the trenches, I can be a nurse and rescue the wounded. Only in this way can the children of all our mothers be happy."
    All the workers in the Road Engineering Office wrote: "You are bravely fighting the enemy in the icy and snowy weather, fearlessly advancing, defending our motherland, and defending our homeland. You are really our good brothers. You have opened up a bright road for us in the front, and we will definitely follow you forward!"
    He Xizhang, who was recuperating in the hospital bed, although suffering from a serious lung disease, still wrote an enthusiastic letter of condolence saying: "I hope my body can recover in the shortest possible time, so that I can fight alongside you on the battlefield in the future."

            Children's Joy and Anger
    The children of the Cheng Zhi School attached to our school, their comfort bags and letters of condolence, expressed their unique innocent style. The comfort bags were embroidered with beautiful flowers and red five-pointed stars; the letters were written in a particularly lovable way. Li Yunqing wrote in her letter: "I am a seven-year-old girl. Although I am young, I also know that American imperialism is really hateful, I hope you beat him up properly." Zhang Zhengyuan said: "I am a seven-year-old boy. I am very happy that you can defeat American imperialism. I know American imperialism is a bad egg. My name is Zhang Zhengyuan. I am a student at Cheng Zhi Elementary School of Tsinghua University. After defeating American imperialism, please come to Tsinghua University in Beijing to play with me!" Lu Fang, a member of the Young Pioneers, gave her diary that her mother gave her to the heroic Korean People's Army, and wrote in the diary: "Our people all over the country care about you and support you. We firmly believe that the final victory belongs to you!" Sheng Jieke, a sixth-grade friend, drew a cartoon in his letter of condolence, showing two bayonets of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, beating the mad dog of American imperialism into panic and nowhere to escape.

　　千个慰劳袋千封慰问信
    献给英勇战士
    清华大学工会文教委员会
    一千个慰劳袋
    在抗美援朝保家卫国的热潮中，从十日四起，清华工会和家庭妇女会发起了做慰劳袋和写慰问信的运动。
    工会和家庭妇女会的布告一贴出来，立刻得到了热烈的响应和支持。
    布告上写着：争取一千袋。一个人出几十袋，不算多；数十人合捐一袋，不算少。有多少能力，就自愿地捐献多少。把我们对朝鲜人民军和我们的志愿部队的热爱，对美帝的无限仇恨，具体地表现出来。
    工会和家庭妇女会，根据会员的建议，规定了慰劳袋的尺寸。并要求：口袋外面写明捐献人姓名和服务处所。每个慰劳袋中，都附一封慰劳信；信要写得简短热情，不必封口。给中国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军的，要分别开，不要混在一起。容易损坏的东西，不要作慰劳品；慰劳品最好是御寒物和日用品，例如毛巾、手套、内衣等。十九日以前交袋；一千个袋是工作目标，但不要单纯追求数字，不应有半点勉强。
    行政单位第三基层组，首先很快地展开了工作。每个人根据自己的情况，尽可能拿出最大限度的钱来。他们在小组会上组织了工作队，分工合作，有的收钱，有的买慰劳品，有的缝袋，有的写慰问信，大家愉快、紧张地工作着。
    很快地，工会办公室堆满了各式各样彩色的袋子。深蓝的，红的，黑的，白的。注册组同志们的，一律蓝色，写着正规化的艺术字，既大方，又美观。生物系十五位会员献四十三个袋；每个袋子都贴上一颗红星，既整齐，又庄严。家庭妇女们的，都非常细致，上面绣着美丽的花朵，或者红五角星。
    规定是十九日交袋，可是十八日下午，会员们就兴高采烈地把慰劳品送到工会来了。
    会员们忘记了十九日是星期日。这一天，工会办公室里，从来没有过的那么热闹，从来没有过的那么多人，从来没有过的都在紧张工作。从上午九时开始，会员们络绎不绝地把慰劳袋送到工会来。工会负责同志就忙着接受，登记，清点。
            无微不至的关怀
    预定的计划是一千袋，收到的已经是一千一百二十袋，超过了原来的数目。
    单纯数字上的胜利，还不足以描绘出慰劳袋所包含的体贴入微的关怀。
    家庭妇女们，恐怕战士衣衫破了，找不到针线，有的就在袋里放着针和线。有的在袋里放着一卷毛线，为的是手套破了可以当作补的材料。
    希望志愿部队在战斗中争取做一个光荣的共产党员，营建系的一位同志在袋里献上一本党章。
    林徽音亲自制了一件骆驼毛棉背心，她说：“希望它能在寒冷的天气里，给朝鲜的人民军战士温暖。”
    江载芬把她收集的解放后一年来的邮票，寄给志愿部队，因为从这一年来的邮票中，可以回忆到我们中华人民共和国的伟大成就。
    我们清点了所有的袋子，每一块布，每一针，每一线，每一件慰劳品，都表现了同志们的精心设计和无限关怀。
    诗和信
    慰劳袋里附上的信或诗，字字句句，都是无比的热情，亲切，和表示了爱慕敬仰。另一方面，对于美帝的仇恨，每一句，每一个字，都远胜过原子弹的威力！
    华罗庚教授特别在慰劳袋里附上一首诗，盛赞人民军及志愿部队的英勇，并以此送给英雄代敬礼。
    严仁荫教授的信上说：“我们保证把书教好，帮助政府解决国防和生产的问题。同志们！安心向前吧！家里的事，交给我们了，一切不要你们挂念，我们期望你们早日凯旋回来。”刘仙洲教授写着：“希望你们帮助朝鲜的友军，快快把野蛮的侵略军打败。当你们回到北京的时候，我们一定为你们准备一次盛大的欢迎。”段学复教授还说：“微薄的礼物是不足以表示我对于你的敬意的，口袋是我六十九岁的老母亲亲手做的。”
    周撷清的信上说：“我的五岁小女，看到家里预备了七份慰劳袋，着急的说：“妈妈，为什么你们大家都可以给志愿兵送礼物，单单我没有呢？老师说的：美国兵真坏，会欺侮我们小孩，亏得志愿兵将他们打跑了。我也要送礼物。”我答应慰问袋上写上她的名字，她才满意了。她还说：“我长大了也要当志愿兵，人家的妈妈也会这样爱我，给我做新手套，买好东西的。”由此可见，你们这次义勇行为，在全中国、全世界爱好和平人士的心目中是怎样的看法。勇猛前进吧，我们永远在支援着你们！”地质系的杨先生说：“我是一个七月娃娃的妈妈。现在美帝发动这可耻的侵略以后，我马上认识了这事的严重性，我虽然热爱我的孩子，但是当国家需要时，我会上前线和你们一起作战。我可以在战壕里打枪，我可以做看护和抢救伤员。不如此，我们一切妈妈们的孩子是不会得到幸福的。”
    路工室全体工友写道：“你们在冰天雪地不怕冷地英勇杀敌，勇敢前进，保卫了我们祖国，保卫了我们家乡。你们真是我们的好弟兄。你们在前面给我们开出一条明亮的道路，我们一定跟着你们前进！”
    在病床上休养的贺锡璋，虽是患着严重的肺病，但他还写了热烈的慰问信说：“希望身体在最短期内可以好转，以后能够和你们在战场上并肩作战。”
            孩子们的喜悦和愤怒
    我们学校附设的成志学校的小朋友，他们的慰劳袋和慰问信，表示了他们特有的天真风格。慰劳袋上绣着美丽的花，红五角星；信写得特别令人可爱。李云清的信上说：“我是一个七岁的女孩。虽然我小，可是也知道美帝国主义真可恶，希望你好好地揍他一顿。”张正元说：“我是七岁的男孩。我很喜欢你能把美帝打败了。我知道美帝是坏蛋。我名字叫张正元。我是清华大学成志小学的学生。打败了美帝，请你到北京清华大学找我玩玩吧！”少年儿童队队员吕芳把她妈妈送给她的日记本转送给英勇的朝鲜人民军，并且在日记本上写着：“我们全国人民都关心着你们，支援着你们。我们深信最后胜利是属于你们的！”六年级盛捷克小朋友在他的慰劳信里画着一张漫画，表示中国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军的两把刺刀，把美帝这只疯狗打得惊惶失措，无地可逃。
