　　Peace Capital

    Countless trains, fully loaded with peace envoys, poured into Warsaw from all directions. Each locomotive had a huge flag hanging on it, with a white dove standing in the middle of a blue background, telling people that this was a peace train heading to the capital of peace. From the moment it entered the Polish border, the peace train was warmly welcomed by the Polish people station after station.
    Amidst the enthusiastic shouts of "Long live" in Polish, our train entered Warsaw Central Station, which was filled with national flags. The Chinese delegation, the Soviet delegation, and the Korean delegation arrived in Warsaw on the same train on the 13th. We passed through countless dazzling torches and searchlights, and welcomers holding banners in various languages threw bouquets of flowers at us. The cold wind was blowing, and huge raindrops were falling from the sky, and people's clothes were already soaked, but their hearts and blood were fiery.
    On the streets, the people of Warsaw frequently waved to the peace representatives, and the children were smiling. Flags adorned with peace doves and the red and white Polish national flag were hung everywhere. Posters with the word "Peace" written in Polish, Russian, and English were plastered everywhere. Many places were adorned with portraits of Beirut and Joliot-Curie. The Polish people felt infinitely honored that the World Peace Congress was being held in their country.
    Warsaw, a city that suffered tremendous damage in the war, a city where 85 percent of its industries and buildings were completely destroyed by artillery fire, has stood up from the ruins after five years of hard work by the working people, and the city has been restored to 60 percent of its pre-war state. This is a new Warsaw, and the traces of the old Warsaw are gradually disappearing.
    The people of Warsaw are working with all their strength to restore and rebuild. The streets are full of materials and machines for construction. Tall building frames can be seen everywhere, and laborers can be seen everywhere creating a new world with their hands. The Central Committee Building of the Polish United Workers' Party, which is about to be completed, is located in the center of the capital. New buildings as magnificent as this building are increasing month by month. The capital will gradually expand, and by the time the six-year plan is completed, the new Warsaw will be twenty times the size of the old Warsaw.
    The Vistula River divides Warsaw into two parts, the Warsaw district on the west bank and the Praga district on the east bank. Several large bridges spanning the river connect the two districts and unite the capital into one. After nightfall, when people look out from high places, they can see the Vistula River lying like a black belt, while Warsaw and Praga are brightly lit.
    When the outstanding people of the world who love peace gather, Warsaw has not yet snowed, the climate is not yet cold, and the earth still retains the green that symbolizes youth. The capital of peace is full of vitality, and it faces the future with a majestic posture.

### 和平首都

　　和平首都
    新华社随和大代表团记者  胡韦德
    无数的列车满载着和平使者从四面八方涌向华沙。每辆机车上都挂着一幅巨大的旗子，在蓝底中间立着一只白色的鸽子，它告诉人们这是一列开往和平首都的和平列车。从进入波兰边境开始，和平列车就一站接着一站地受到波兰人民的热烈欢迎。
    在热烈的用波兰语喊出的“万岁”声中，我们的列车进入了插满各国国旗的华沙中央车站，中国代表团和苏联代表团以及朝鲜代表团是十三日同车到达华沙的。我们从数不清的耀眼的火炬与探照灯中间穿过，欢迎者手持各种文字的标语，把一束一束的鲜花投向我们。寒风在吹着，天空落下极大的雨点，人们的衣服已经淋湿，但心和血却是火热的。
    在大街上，华沙的人民向和平代表频频招手，孩子们在笑着。到处都挂着缀有和平鸽的旗子，和红白二色的波兰国旗。到处都贴着用波兰文、俄文和英文写着“和平”的标语。许多地方都挂着贝鲁特和约里奥——居里的像片。波兰人民因为世界保卫和平大会在他们的祖国召开而感到无限光荣。
    华沙，这个在战争中遭到极大破坏的城市，这个百分之八十五的工业和建筑物曾完全被毁于炮火的城市，经过劳动人民五年来的努力奋斗，已在废墟中矗立起来，全市已恢复到战前的百分之六十。这是一个新的华沙，那旧的华沙的痕迹已经逐渐消逝了。
    华沙的人民正以全力在从事恢复与建设。街上满布着用于建筑的器材和机器。到处都可以看到高大的建筑架子，到处都可以看到劳动者在用手创造新世界。即将竣工的波兰统一工人党中央委员会大厦，位于首都的中心，像这座大厦一样壮丽的新建筑物，正一月比一月地增多起来。首都将逐渐扩大，到六年计划完成时，新华沙将扩大到旧华沙的二十倍。
    维斯杜拉河把华沙分为两部分，河西是华沙区、河东是布拉加区，横跨河上的几条大桥把两区连接起来，又使首都合而为一。入夜以后，人们从高处眺望时，可以看到维斯杜拉河像一条黑带似地躺着，华沙和布拉加则灯火辉煌。
    当全世界爱好和平的优秀的人们汇集之时，华沙还没有降雪，气候还不寒冷，大地上仍然留着象征青春的绿色。和平首都充满了生命力，它以雄伟的姿态面对着将来。
