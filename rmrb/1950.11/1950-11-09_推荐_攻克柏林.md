　　Recommendation of "The Fall of Berlin"
　　Cai Chusheng
　　"The Fall of Berlin" is a brilliant and great masterpiece of socialist realist film art. This production, when it first came out, garnered over two million viewers in just ten days of screenings in Moscow and other locations in the Soviet Union. At the fifth International Film Festival in Czechoslovakia, it also won the top prize for five major awards, attracting worldwide attention.
　　First of all, this production was not created following the inherent, general methods of feature films or news documentaries; like "The Third Blow" and "The Battle of Stalingrad," it appears in the form of an artistic documentary. This new form of creation, like feature films, is not limited by time and space, but it gets rid of the fictionality of feature films and also makes up for the incompleteness of news documentaries. It often takes the great battles and events of our generation (of course, there may also be historical classical art documentaries) as the object of creation, and through artistic means, it "reproduces" real people and real events in a generalized and concentrated way. In these huge battles and events, because many facts are still "vividly in people's minds," and because of the complexity of the events themselves, and because some things and enemies (such as Hitler in this film) have already been destroyed, it is a very difficult task to express them concisely and accurately in the first place. More importantly, judgments on many events and figures, as well as some hateful or subtle relationships that had already formed or were growing internationally at that time, could not be expressed "appropriately" without profound observation and a high degree of political and theoretical literacy. However, the authors of "The Fall of Berlin," Pavlenko and Chiaureli, lightly completed such a masterpiece with high achievements in both artistry and ideology, which cannot but make people pay them infinite admiration.
　　The story of "The Fall of Berlin" begins before the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. What unfolds at the beginning is a beautiful spring—a happy world dreamed of by millions of people for countless years. There, strong and lively children are singing innocently; Natasha, as beautiful as spring flowers, is doing a good job of serving the children; the young steelworker Ivanov is creating new steelmaking records for the peace and happiness of mankind; the great revolutionary teacher Stalin is caring for the people's brilliant achievements and everything else like a father; Natasha and Ivanov move from mutual affection to passionate love... However, the fascist bandit Hitler obviously does not want this happy world, this paradise on earth, to exist. He wants to destroy it, level it to the ground, he wants to make all good people his slaves, so as to carry out his brutal and mad rule and plunder. Thus, the cruel aggressive war of the German bandits descended on the peaceful Soviet land! But Hitler did not expect that his fantasy of "turning the clock of history forward a hundred years" could never be realized again. Since the emergence of the great Marxism-Leninism that will illuminate the ages and be forever believed by the people, the broad masses of the people, armed with this ideology, can no longer be defeated and arbitrarily enslaved! The peace-loving Soviet Union, although temporarily defeated due to the perfidy of the German bandits, and Natasha and others were also captured and imprisoned in the terrible concentration camps in Berlin, the people, under the call of the great Marshal Stalin, mobilized with unparalleled anger, regardless of men, women, old or young. Ivanov and others also joined this anti-aggression war! Thus, from June 22, 1941, due to the people's high degree of patriotism and arduous and unremitting struggle with the German bandits, after the Battle of Stalingrad turned the entire war situation, until April 30, 1945, when the Soviet army captured Berlin, Hitler crawled into the basement with eight meters of reinforced concrete on top, and ordered the cruel flooding of the underground railway, drowning thousands of children, patients, and good people, and finally followed his wolf dog to take poison and end his sinful life!
　　Finally, there is the reappearance of light, the reunion of Ivanov and Natasha after experiencing calamities, and the wise leader of the people, Stalin, flies to Berlin, making a brilliant and moving speech with foresight: "From today onwards, history has unfolded its broad path again in front of the freedom-loving people, and every nation must fight for world peace. Fight for the happiness of the whole world, all mankind, and the people. Only then can we say that our sacrifices have not been in vain, and that each of us can bravely look at our own future." This is how the whole play ends.
　　Today, it should be a matter of special significance for us in China to present this production of "The Fall of Berlin."
　　Today, the mad war-mongers are seriously threatening world peace, American imperialism has invaded our Taiwan, Korea is burning in flames, and more than 20 million innocent people are being slaughtered under the brutal fire and rule of the American imperialists, and the flames of aggression have already approached our national gate! Like the Soviet Union, we love peace, and like the Soviet Union, when the invaders dare to invade us, the great Chinese nation—the awakened 475 million people—will surely rise up heroically to fight, and resolutely destroy the common enemy of mankind in order to defend the motherland and defend world peace! This has already been demonstrated in the brilliant victories at home and abroad achieved by the Chinese people in the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Self-Defense, and when we see "The Fall of Berlin"—the reappearance of the historical facts of World War II—we once again recognize that the people are inviolable, and that the invaders will eventually be destroyed! This "lesson"—what the entire theme of "The Fall of Berlin" expresses is precisely that when war-mongers are making violent roars, aggressors are setting off flames of war everywhere, and the people are heroically rising up to fight a life-and-death struggle, advanced artists are giving the aggressors a head-on blow, and giving the people the most powerful and educational production in the ideological arming.
　　The hanging corpse of Mussolini in the Milan market, the shadow of Tojo Hideki's knife used for seppuku, and the shadow of Hitler lying down with that wolf dog, the shadow of the gallows in Nuremberg used to hang Nazi war criminals, when new and ugly war criminals begin to attack the people, history is destined that these shadows have already enveloped their surroundings, and are only a matter of time waiting for the angry people to make the final judgment! The power of the people is enormous, and world peace and happiness will inevitably appear. Let us use incomparably strong fighting spirit and a hundredfold confidence to accept this combat mission of striking down the aggressors, which is initiated after "The Fall of Berlin"!
　　"The Fall of Berlin" is timely presented in China, and it will surely play an infinite educational and inspiring role for our people. I would like to wholeheartedly recommend this epoch-making masterpiece to the vast audience in China.
　　Evening of November 2nd.

　　推荐“攻克柏林”
    蔡楚生
    “攻克柏林”是社会主义的现实主义电影艺术一部光辉而伟大的巨制。这制作，当它刚一问世时，在苏联莫斯科等两处的放映，仅十天就获得了两百多万观众。而在捷克斯洛伐克所举行的第五届国际电影节上，又荣获了五个主要奖的首奖，更受到全世界的瞩目。
    首先，这制作并不是遵循着固有的、一般的故事片或新闻记录片的方法而创作的，它和“第三次打击”、“斯大林格勒大血战”等同样是以艺术记录片的形式而出现的。这种新的创作形式，和故事片一样都不受时空的限制，但却摆脱了故事片的虚构性，也弥补了新闻记录片的残缺不全。它往往是以我们这一世代中（当然也可能有历史性的古典艺术记录片出现）的大战役大事件作为创作的对象，通过了艺术手腕，把真人和真事概括而集中地加以“再现”。在这种巨大的战役与事件中，由于许多事实都还“彰彰在人耳目”，也由于事件本身的错综复杂，以及有些已经是被毁灭了的事物与敌人（如本片的希特勒等），因此要表现得既简练而又准确，首先就是一桩十分困难的事情。而更其重要的是，对许多事件和人物的论断，以及当时在国际间已经形成的或正在滋长着的某些可憎的或微妙的关系，都非有深刻的观察力和高度的政治与理论的素养，就无法表现得“恰如其份”。但“攻克柏林”的作者巴甫连柯和齐阿乌列里，却举重若轻地完成了这样一部在艺术性和思想性上都有高度成就的巨制，更不能不使人致其无限的钦佩。
    “攻克柏林”的故事，起自一九四一年德寇的侵苏以前。开始所展开的是一片美丽的春天——一个千万人民无数年月以来所梦想的幸福的世界。那里壮健而活泼的孩子们在天真地歌唱着；像春花一般美好的娜塔莎在替孩子作着很好的服务；年青的炼钢工人伊凡诺夫在为人类的和平幸福创造着炼钢的新纪录；伟大的革命导师斯大林像父亲般亲切地在关切着人民辉煌的成就以至一切；娜塔莎和伊凡诺夫由互恋而进入热恋……。然而法西斯匪徒希特勒，对这幸福的世界，人间的乐园，却显然是不愿意它存在的。他要摧毁它，夷平它，他要使所有善良的人民做他的奴隶，从而进行他残暴而疯狂的统治和掠夺。于是，德寇残酷的侵略战争就降临到和平的苏联国土上来了！但希特勒没有想到，他那“要把历史的钟向前拨转一百年”的狂想是再也不可能实现了，人类自从出现了将照耀着千秋万世永为人民所信奉的伟大的马列主义之后，广大的人民大众有了这思想上的武装，就再也不是可以战胜与可以任意加以奴役的了！爱好和平的苏联，虽因德寇的背信弃义而暂时受到挫败，娜塔莎们也被俘而囚在柏林可怖的集中营里，但人民在巨人斯大林大元帅的号召之下，全国无论男女老幼都带着无比的愤怒动员起来了，伊凡诺夫们也投入了这反侵略的战争了！这样，从一九四一年的六月二十二日起，由于人民发挥了高度的爱国主义精神，艰苦卓绝地和德寇作不息的奋战，在斯大林格勒战役扭转了整个战局之后，直打到一九四五年四月三十日苏军攻克柏林，希特勒钻进了上面有八米厚的钢骨水泥的地下室，又下令残酷地放水灌入地下铁道淹死了千百孩子、病人、和善良的人民，而终于追随着他的一匹狼狗服下了毒药结束了他罪恶的一生为止！
    最后是光明的再现，伊凡诺夫和娜塔莎的历劫重逢，人民英明的领袖斯大林飞抵柏林，作着光辉而带有预言性的动人的演讲：“从今天起，历史在爱好自由的人民面前，又展开了它的宽广路途，每一个民族，都要为全世界的和平而斗争。为全世界、全人类、人民的幸福斗争。也只有那时候我们才可以说，我们的牺牲没有白牺牲，我们每一个人都能勇敢地看着自己的未来”。这样结束了全剧。
    在今天，我们中国来献映“攻克柏林”这一制作，应该是一桩有着特殊意义的事情。
    在今天，疯狂的战争贩子们正在严重地威胁着世界的和平，美帝国主义侵入了我们的台湾，朝鲜正在烈焰中燃烧，两千多万无辜的人民在美帝残暴的炮火和统治之下被屠杀，而且侵略的凶焰已经逼临我们的国门了！我们正像苏联一样，我们是爱好和平的，也像苏联一样，当侵略者敢于侵犯到我们的时候，伟大的中华民族—觉醒了的四万七千五百万人民，也一定能英勇无比地起来奋战，为着保卫祖国，保卫世界的和平而坚强地击灭人类共同的敌人！这在抗日战争和自卫战争中国人民所获得的震灿中外的辉煌的胜利中，就已表现了这种无比的英雄气概，而当我们看到“攻克柏林”——这第二次世界大战的史实的再现时，又一次地使我们体认了人民之不可侵犯，与侵略者之终于必趋灭亡！这“殷鉴”——“攻克柏林”全部的主题思想所表现的，正是这个战争贩子在作狂暴叫嚣，侵略者随处在点燃着战火，人民正英勇地起来作生死搏斗的时候，先进的艺术家们所给予侵略者的当头棒喝，和给予人民在思想的武装上最有力和最具教育意义的制作。
    米兰市场墨索里尼那倒悬的尸影，东条英机用以切腹的刀影，随着那狼狗而躺下的希特勒的魔影，纽伦堡用以绞杀纳粹战犯的那绞刑架的阴影，当新的丑恶的战争罪犯们向人民开始进行攻击时，历史就注定这些影子都已笼罩着他们的四周，而只是时间问题地在等候着愤怒的人民来作最后的裁判！人民的力量是巨大无比的，全世界的和平幸福必然会要出现，让我们用坚强无比的斗志，百倍的信心，来接受这继“攻克柏林”所描写而起的打击侵略者的战斗任务吧！
    “攻克柏林”适时地在中国举行献映，它必将对我们的民众起着无限的教育作用和鼓舞作用。我谨以衷心的热诚把这旷世的巨制推荐给中国广大的观众。
        十一月二日晚。
