The National Pharmaceutical Industry Conference, organized by the Ministry of Light Industry and the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, was held from August 25th to September 1st, 1950, lasting eight days. Seventy-four representatives from relevant authorities and regions attended, including: 23 representatives from the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, the Health Department of the Central Military Commission, and the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government; 12 representatives from the Government Administration Council, the Financial and Economic Committee, the Cultural and Educational Committee, the Supervisory Committee, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions; 38 representatives from health departments, industry departments, and public and private pharmaceutical factories in East China, Northeast China, North China, Northwest China, Southwest China, and Central South China; and one representative from the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation. Additionally, there were four specially invited expert representatives and fourteen representatives from the traditional Chinese medicine industry and various regions attending as observers.

The following is a report on the proceedings of the conference and the issues addressed:

(1) After listening to the reports by Minister Huang and Deputy Minister Su, and the report by Director Huang of the Medical Administration Bureau on the resolutions regarding pharmaceutical administration from the National Health Conference, the conference began with reports from various regions. In these reports, representatives gained a comprehensive understanding of the national pharmaceutical industry, reviewed the production capacity of pharmaceutical factories in various regions, and unanimously agreed that private pharmaceutical factories still generally exhibited a state of diverse varieties, speculative waste, and blind production; the production policies of public pharmaceutical factories were also not sufficiently clear. Furthermore, the primary raw materials for pharmaceutical production still relied on foreign supply, making it impossible to achieve independence and self-sufficiency. This situation not only created various difficulties for the current pharmaceutical industry but also hindered further recovery and development.

After four days of group discussions, the conference unanimously agreed that, utilizing the country's industrial base, developing the pharmaceutical industry, aligning with the principles of "prevention first, treatment second" advocated in health work, and serving the working class, farmers, and soldiers, the pharmaceutical industry must establish a policy of prioritizing the production of raw materials over finished products in order to fundamentally break free from the constraints of imperialism and gradually achieve self-sufficiency.

(2) The conference thoroughly discussed the realization of future production plans, pointed out the errors of the past, such as the lack of scope, planning, and blind production, and decided to base future production on the new Chinese Pharmacopoeia currently being compiled, proposing the raw material drugs that they could manufacture, that were inexpensive, and suitable for mass needs, as the scope of future production. Based on existing human resources, material resources, and other production conditions and needs, it estimated the quantity close to the actual needs in 1951 in order to supply the broad masses of the people. The conference unanimously agreed that narcotic drugs and biological products (serum vaccines) must be manufactured uniformly by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government. The government could provide appropriate aftercare for existing private biological products factories in various regions.

The conference proposed the necessary types of raw material drugs, divided into three categories with emphasis. It also initially allocated production tasks within major administrative regions according to the capabilities of public and private pharmaceutical factories in each region. Category 1: Those that can be completely self-sufficient, with the hope of fully guaranteeing completion within 1951. Category 2: Those that can be partially self-sufficient. In addition to the portion that must be purchased from abroad, the government should adopt policies such as import controls, tariff protection, promotion of research, and encouragement of production for the self-made portion, striving to achieve complete self-sufficiency within three to five years. Category 3: Those that are currently difficult to self-sufficient, which must be purchased from abroad. Although this part has many technical problems, it is hoped that everyone will work hard, strengthen research, and strive to solve it as soon as possible. In order to complete this task, the health and industrial authorities of major administrative regions must lead public and private pharmaceutical factories to formulate appropriate and specific division of labor production plans and submit them to the central government for approval.

Regarding the utilization of traditional Chinese medicine, the conference believed that traditional Chinese medicine has a long history and is still widely needed in rural areas. It cannot be completely replaced by Western medicine in the short term. It must be organized and studied using modern scientific methods, and several of the most commonly used types should be selected with emphasis, examining their morphology, content, general reactions, and main efficacies, and compiling them into classics so that research and application can be followed. Drugs for preventing and treating infectious diseases that pose the greatest threat to workers, farmers, and soldiers, such as malaria and dysentery, must be studied as soon as possible.

(3) In order to coordinate with the production plan, the conference also conducted careful discussions on raw material supply and finished product marketing. Regarding raw material supply, relevant departments such as the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Food Industry, and the Ministry of Fuel Industry must encourage production and find solutions. Regarding finished product marketing, it is hoped that under the leadership of the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation, the relevant government departments (including the military) will promptly make a relatively accurate estimate of the quantity of drugs needed, and coordinate orders and acquisitions in a unified manner to promote the production of pharmaceutical factories. In addition, there are also principled regulations on import and export trade issues.

(4) The conference reviewed the past management and operation of pharmaceutical factories, pointing out that in the past, public pharmaceutical factories were not managed as enterprises due to their focus on meeting wartime needs, often with a focus on emergency and simple tasks. Some private pharmaceutical factories were also tainted with a strong tendency toward blind speculation, extravagant decoration, and advertising for profit, all of which must be corrected. In the future, regardless of whether they are public or private pharmaceutical factories, their operations must be enterprise-based and their management must be democratized. They must streamline their organizations, strengthen management, and gradually implement economic accounting to achieve the goal of reducing costs and improving quality. In order to reduce the burden on the masses of the people, it is necessary to simplify packaging and reduce advertising. Local trade associations should, under the leadership of the competent authorities, evaluate prices based on reasonable costs and appropriate profits. Each factory should strictly inspect its own products, and the government should strengthen local inspection work and conduct random checks at any time to ensure the safety of drug use. Substandard drugs should be strictly banned. Regarding proprietary Chinese medicines, the conference agreed that it is not appropriate to take immediate action to ban them, nor should they continue to be allowed to go unchecked. They must be restricted in a differentiated and timed manner.

In order to achieve the rational development of the pharmaceutical industry, pharmaceutical factories currently concentrated in coastal cities should be moved to the vast inland areas to facilitate local production in coordination with raw materials. Currently, most pharmaceutical factories are small and medium-sized, with weak foundations and disorganized structures. In the future, joint operations can be adopted on a voluntary basis to concentrate strength, enrich equipment and personnel, and gradually develop.

(5) Regarding the relationship between public and private sectors in the pharmaceutical industry, the conference unanimously agreed that the production of essential drugs is greatly insufficient, not excessive. In response to this shortcoming, reasonable adjustments can only be achieved through division of labor and cooperation. The following methods were pointed out and unanimously agreed upon at the conference:

(1) According to the overall production plan, public and private pharmaceutical factories should formulate individual manufacturing and production plans based on raw materials, equipment, and technology to achieve division of labor in production. (2) In terms of technical exchanges between public and private pharmaceutical factories and various regions, visiting groups and technical teams should be jointly organized. Public and private pharmaceutical factories can borrow personnel from each other, and regions with advanced technologies should send personnel to regions with less advanced technologies to provide guidance, so that pharmaceutical technical experience nationwide can be exchanged and cooperated. (3) The products of public pharmaceutical factories should currently focus on supplying the military and public health and medical institutions, while appropriately regulating the market. However, the sales of private pharmaceutical factories must be taken into account. Private pharmaceutical factories should mainly supply private medical institutions and general market needs, thereby seeking division of labor in sales. (4) Strengthen the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation's organization, gradually undertake the task of regulating the marketing of public and private pharmaceutical factories' products, stabilizing drug prices, and importing organization and export trade. Establish investigation and statistics departments to understand domestic and foreign market conditions, control materials, regulate the market, and establish business research committees as needed to gradually take responsibility for purchasing raw materials and promoting finished products for public pharmaceutical factories, so that public pharmaceutical factories can concentrate on production. The business of pharmaceutical companies should focus on wholesale to pharmacies, and private pharmacies should focus on retail sales in stores, and should turn to the development of small and medium-sized cities and rural areas. The processing of drugs by local pharmaceutical companies must be discussed and allocated for production through local industrial and commercial bureaus and pharmaceutical industry trade associations, reviewing prices and determining specifications. (5) Public medical and health undertakings should join local trade associations, and must play a leading role in private medical and health undertakings in their work; at the same time, private medical and health undertakings must also closely contact public undertakings, provide opinions in terms of technical exchanges and management methods, and promote the overall development of Chinese medical and health undertakings.

(6) The main results of this conference were to determine the scope of essential drugs, make preliminary estimates of the quantity of essential drugs needed in 1951, and formulate a plan for regional production and division of labor. However, its implementation still depends on the strengthening of leadership and unified supervision by the health and industrial authorities of various regions.

The Chinese pharmaceutical industry has been under the long-term oppression of three enemies for the past 30 years, relying on the supply of raw material drugs from imperialism, forming a semi-colonial mode of production, resulting in a dependency mentality and an unsound state of being biased towards processing and manufacturing. Through this conference, representatives have all enhanced their confidence in self-reliance and are willing to take the path of transformation under the leadership of the government. However, the transition from adjustment to transformation is a difficult process. This pharmaceutical conference is only the beginning of the adjustment. In the future, it must also be coordinated with the development of other industrial sectors, taking into account financial resources, human resources, material resources, and actual needs, and vigorously reverse the incorrect direction of the past and move forward steadily.

　　中央人民政府轻工业部、卫生部
    全国制药工业会议综合报告
    ——一九五○年十月二十日政务院第五十五次政务会议批准
    全国制药工业会议于一九五零年八月二十五日开始，九月一日结束，历时八日。出席各有关机关及各地区代表七十四人。计：中央人民政府卫生部、中央军委卫生部、中央人民政府轻工业部代表共二十三人，政务院、财经委员会、文教委员会、监委会、财政部、重工业部、全国总工会等代表共十二人，华东、东北、华北、西北、西南、中南各地区卫生部、工业部、公私营药厂代表共三十八人，中国医药公司代表一人。另有特邀专家代表四人，国药业及各地区列席代表十四人。
    兹将会议经过情形和解决的问题报告如下：
    （一）会议在听取了黄兼部长及苏副部长的报告和医政局黄局长关于全国卫生会议药政方面决议的传达报告后，随即开始各地区的汇报。在报告中，代表们了解了全国制药工业的全面情况，检阅了各地药厂的生产能力，一致认为目前私营药厂还普遍存在着种类纷繁、投机浪费、盲目生产的状态；公营药厂的生产方针亦不够明确。而制药主要原料仍依赖国外供应，不能作到独立自给。这种情况不仅造成了目前制药工业种种的困难，而且阻碍着进一步的恢复和发展。
    经过了四天的小组讨论，会议一致同意，利用本国工业基础，发展制药工业，配合卫生工作方面所揭橥的“预防为主、治疗为辅”的原则，和为工农兵大众服务的方向，在制药工业方面必须确定以制造原料为主、制剂为辅的方针，才能从基本上脱离帝国主义的羁绊，逐步做到自给自足。
    （二）会议详细讨论了今后生产计划的实现，指出过去漫无范围、无计划、盲目生产的错误，决定根据正在编纂中的新中华药典，提出自己能够制造的，价格低廉的，适合大众需要的原料药品，作为今后生产的范围。按照我们现有的人力、物力等生产条件和需要情况，估计一九五一年接近实际需要的数量，借以供应广大人民群众。会议一致同意麻醉药品及生物制品（血清疫苗）必须由中央人民政府卫生部统一制造。对于目前各地私营的生物制品工厂，政府可给予适当的善后照顾。
    会议提出了必需原料药品种类，有重点的分为三类。并按各地区公私药厂能力，初步分配了各大行政区内的生产任务。第一类：全部可以自给者，希望在一九五一年内全部保证完成。第二类：部分可以自给者，除部分必须向国外购买外，自制部分建议政府采取进口管制，关税保护，提倡研究，鼓励生产等政策，争取在三五年内完全自给。第三类：目前尚难自给者，须向国外购买，这部分虽然由于技术方面问题较多，但希望大家努力，加强研究，尽早争取解决。为了完成这个任务，各大行政区的卫生与工业主管部门必须领导公私药厂，做出适当而具体的分工生产计划，呈报中央批准决定。
    在中药的利用方面，会议认为中药历史悠久，在农村还有广大的需要，短期间尚不可能为西药完全代替，必须用近代科学方法加以整理研究，并应有重点的选定最常用的若干种，考定形态、含量，一般的反应及主要效能等，编成典籍，使研究应用有所遵循。对于防治疟疾、痢疾等危害工农兵最大的传染病药物，必须尽先研究。
    （三）为了配合生产计划，会议对于原料供应，成品推销，也作了缜密的讨论。关于原料供应方面，须由卫生部或重工业部、食品工业部、燃料工业部等有关部门鼓励生产，设法解决。关于成品推销方面，国内部分希望在中国医药公司领导下，将政府有关部门（包括军队）需要的药品数量，从速做出比较正确的估计，以订货及收购方式，统筹订购，促进药厂的生产。此外，关于出入口贸易的问题，亦有原则规定。
    （四）会议检讨了过去药厂的经营管理工作，指出过去公营药厂因适合战时需要，生产常带有突击性和单纯任务观点而未做到企业化。若干私营药厂亦染有浓厚的盲目投机、装璜浪费、广告重利的作风，都是必须纠正的。今后不论公私药厂，经营必须企业化，管理必须民主化，要精简机构，加强管理，逐步实施经济核算，达到减低成本，提高质量的目的。为了减轻人民大众负担起见，简化包装，减少广告是必需的。各地同业公会更应在主管机关领导下，根据合理成本、适当利润，评议价格。各厂应自行严格检验其出品，政府应加强各地检验工作，随时抽查，保障用药之安全。对不合格药品，应予严格取缔。关于成药，会议同意，暂时还不宜采取即时取缔，亦不应继续放任，必须有区别的有时间的加以限制。
    为求制药工业合理发展，现在集中于沿海都市的药厂，应向广大内地迁移，俾可配合原料，就地生产。目前药厂以中小型为多，基础薄弱，组织散漫，今后可在自愿的原则下，采用联营方式，集中力量，充实设备及人员，逐渐发展。
    （五）关于制药工业中的公私关系，会议一致认为必需药品的生产是大大的不足，而不是过剩。针对这一缺点，只有分工与合作，才可以得到合理的调整。会议中指出和一致同意的有下列各项办法：
    （１）依照总的生产计划，公私药厂各就原料、设备、技术方面，订定个别的制造生产计划，求得生产的分工。（２）在公私药厂和各地区间技术交流方面，应共同组织参观团，技术工作队，公私药厂可以相互借用人材，技术进步的地区应调派人员到技术低落的地区去，予以指导，使全国制药技术经验，互相交流合作。（３）公营药厂的产品目前应以供应军队和公营卫生医疗机构为主，同时适当地调剂市场，但须照顾私营药厂的销路，私营药厂以供应私营医疗机构及一般市场需要为主，如此求得销售的分工。（４）加强中国医药公司机构，逐步负担起调剂公私药厂产品的推销，平稳药价，输入组织与输出贸易的任务，设立调查统计部门，了解国内外市场情况，掌握物资，调剂市场，并按需要设立业务研究委员会，逐渐做到负责为公营药厂采购原料，推销成品，使公营药厂集中精力进行生产。医药公司的业务以对药房批发为主，私营药房以门市零售为主，并应转向中小城市及农村发展。各地医药公司有关药品的加工，必须通过各地工商局及制药业同业公会，商讨分配生产，审核价格与确定规格等问题。（５）公营医药事业，应加入当地同业公会，必须在工作中发挥领导私营医药事业的作用；同时私营医药事业也须和公营事业密切联系，在技术交流，经营方法方面，提供意见，促进中国医药事业整个的发展。
    （六）这次会议主要的结果是确定了必需药品的范围，初步估计了一九五一年必需药品的数量，和拟定了分区生产分工的计划，但要贯彻执行，仍有赖于各地区卫生和工业主管机构加强领导与统一监督。
    中国制药工业在过去三十年来，处在三个敌人的长期压迫下面，依靠帝国主义原料药品的供应，形成半殖民地的生产方式，以致造成依赖心理和偏于加工制造的不健全状态。经过这次会议，代表们都提高了自力更生的信心，愿意在政府领导下，走向改造的途径。但从调整到改造，是一个艰难的过程，这次制药会议不过是调整的开始，今后还必须配合其他部门工业的发展，照顾财力、人力、物力和实际需要等方面，大力扭转过去不正确的方向，稳步前进。
