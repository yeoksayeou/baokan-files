Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 24th: The Labor Daily published a dispatch from its Warsaw correspondent Kharlamov on the 22nd, exposing Roach, an American businessman and lawyer, and a lackey of the enemies of peace sent to the Second World Peace Congress, stating that among all the delegates attending the congress, he was the only one who slandered the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. Roach had once hypocritically supported workers, demanded democracy, and participated in the American Progressive Party, but when the test came, he revealed himself to be nothing more than a spy kept by imperialism. As the delegates to the congress said, Roach, in order to get rich, served as the "legal advisor" to the Tito Yugoslav Embassy in the United States for a price of $50,000, and therefore he once again served the Tito gang at this congress. The dispatch continued: Among the foreign representatives entering Britain to attend the congress, Roach was the only one who was not persecuted by the British Labour Party government, which is no accident. Another intriguing thing is that Roach sold a slanderous speech he prepared to deliver at the Warsaw Congress to the British Broadcasting Corporation in advance, but this company, not knowing the date of his speech, broadcast the speech the day before he delivered it!

　　劳动报记者哈拉莫夫揭露
    罗奇是和平敌人的走狗
    五万美元代价为铁托匪帮效劳
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：劳动报于二十二日刊载了哈拉莫夫的华沙通讯，揭露和平敌人派到第二届世界保卫和平大会来的走狗、美国商人兼律师罗奇称：在参加大会的全体代表中，只有他一个人诽谤了苏联和人民民主国家。罗奇曾有一个时期虚伪地赞助工人、要求民主和参加美国进步党，但是当考验的时候来临时，他就显露出自己不过是帝国主义所豢养的间谍而已。正如大会代表所说：罗奇为了发财，曾以五万美元的代价充当铁托南斯拉夫驻美国大使馆的“法律顾问”，因此他在这次大会上又一次为铁托匪帮效劳。通讯继称：在进入英国出席和大的外国代表中，罗奇是唯一未受英国工党政府迫害的人，这并不是偶然的。而耐人寻味的另一件事情是：罗奇把他准备在华沙大会发表的一篇诽谤性的演说辞，预先卖给了英国广播公司，但这家公司不知道他的演说日期，竟在他演说的前一天把讲词广播了！
