On October 21st, the Park Dae-geun guerrilla unit, operating in the northwestern mountainous area of Gangwon Province, made contact with the Kim Eung-sam guerrilla unit, operating in the northeast of South Pyeongan Province. These two guerrilla units cooperated to launch an annihilation battle against a battalion of American mechanized troops advancing north. The American troops, caught by surprise and thrown into panic, did not have time to establish combat positions and attempted to flee eastward. However, their retreat was cut off by the Park Dae-geun guerrilla unit, which was waiting for the enemy. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the enemy finally collapsed and fled, abandoning many corpses and heavy weapons and military vehicles of various calibers.

In this attack, the guerrilla unit also received the active support of nearby residents.

　　A powerful guerrilla unit operating in the Myohyang Mountain area quickly surrounded a company of puppet national defense forces and inflicted a devastating blow on the enemy.
