　　Plans to Intensify Control Over Latin America
    [Xinhua News Agency dispatch] Reuters, Rio de Janeiro, 9th: A spokesman for the U.S. State Department recently announced that U.S. imperialism is intensifying its encroachment on Latin America. The United States will place particular emphasis on Brazil and Mexico, the reason being "partly geographical; Brazil, relative to all other countries, is the largest and most strategically positioned country in the Western Hemisphere, and Mexico is adjacent to the United States."

    The overall plan was presented to U.S. diplomatic representatives in Latin America at a conference in Rio de Janeiro last month. At least half of the films provided by the "U.S. News and Educational Exchange" program will be anti-Soviet propaganda. The people drafting the plan expect that by 1951, the U.S. "exchange" program will concentrate its efforts on winning the "respect and support" of countries in the Western Hemisphere, rather than "friendship."

    According to people here recalling, shortly after the U.S. aggression against Korea, the U.S. State Department received a special appropriation of $97 million in its propaganda budget. Countries surrounding the European people's democracies have "highest priority" in American propaganda efforts. Those here understand that Brazil and Mexico will receive priority equal to that of Western Europe.

　　计划加紧控制拉丁美洲
    【新华社讯】电通社里约热内卢九日电：美国国务院发言人最近宣布美帝国主义正加紧侵入拉丁美洲。美国将特别侧重于巴西与墨西哥，原因“一半是地理上的，巴西对其他所有国家说来，是西半球国家中面积最大，位置最有战略意义的国家，墨西哥是与美国毗邻的”。
    总的计划是上月在里约热内卢一个会议上在美国驻拉丁美洲外交代表之前提出来的。《美国新闻与教育交流》计划所供给的影片，至少有一半将是反苏宣传品。草拟计划的人们预计至一九五一年，美国“交流”计划将集中力量博得西半球国家的“尊崇与拥护”，而不是“友谊”。
    据此间人士追忆，在美国侵略朝鲜后不久，美国国务院在其宣传预算中得到了一笔九千七百万美元的特别拨款。环绕在欧洲人民民主国家周围的国家，在美国宣传努力上占有“最高优先”权，此间了解巴西与墨西哥所得的优先权将与西欧相等。
