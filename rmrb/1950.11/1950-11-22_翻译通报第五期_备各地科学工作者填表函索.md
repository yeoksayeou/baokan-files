Translation Bulletin, Issue 5
Available for Scientists Nationwide to Request by Filling Out a Form

The fifth issue of "Translation Bulletin" was published on the 15th of this month. This issue first published "Fast's Letter to Soviet Writers" (translated by Ye Zhimei) in English and Chinese parallel text. This is a just call from the American people issued by a famous writer. It exposes the heinous true face of American imperialism, and also illustrates the deep and sincere friendship between the Soviet and American people, which is a powerful blow to American imperialism! Luo Shusi's "Introduction to Tytler's Theory of Translation" is a very meaningful article for improving the theoretical level of our translation community. In terms of book reviews, there is Xiao Shi's "Two Translation Methods of 'From Ape to Man'," with replies from Comrades Cao Baohua and Zheng Yili; Bao Xu's "Two Translations of 'Marxism in Linguistics'" is a summary of collective study. Regarding translation of names, it includes Wang Wanyan's "Transliteration and Literal Translation," Pan Lang's "On the Translation of Place Names and Personal Names of Eastern Countries," Kuang Keren's "Discussion on the Chinese Translation of MeToдMehTopoB," and the Terminology Committee's Current Affairs Group's "English-Chinese Concordance of Country Names and Capital Names of the World." In addition, there is Han Yu's "On the Translation of the Russian Noun Genitive Case," Yu Yuanzun's "Several Issues in Translating Mongolian History," as well as translation short essays (seven articles), translation news (28 items), translation plans (seven items), mailbox (seven letters), and translation workers' symposium. The "Preliminary Statistics of All Translators" published by the editorial board provides a bird's-eye view of the current activities of translators across the country. This issue is still not for sale. Translators across the country are welcome to fill out a form to request it. The mailing address is "No. 10, Dongzongbu Hutong, Beijing."
