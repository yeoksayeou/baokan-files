　　French Reactionaries Thoroughly Disgraced
    Bidault and de Gaulle Collude
    Bidault Embezzled Huge Sums for Wedding Expenses
    [Xinhua News Agency dispatch] According to a dispatch from the Teletype Agency in Paris on the 20th, Georges Bidault, chairman of the Popular Republican Movement (Catholic Party), who formerly served as French Premier and Foreign Minister, has recently been discredited due to the exposure of his corruption and collusion with the fascist leader de Gaulle.
    At the time of the liberation of France, Bidault was the chairman of the Resistance Committee. At that time, he used his position to embezzle 35 million francs from London belonging to the resistance movement. In 1946, he embezzled 15 million francs from de Gaulle, originally belonging to the resistance movement, to purchase luxurious gifts for his wife at his wedding. These misdeeds of Bidault were discovered by Soustelle, who once led de Gaulle's intelligence agency and is now the Secretary-General of the de Gaullist fascist organization "Rally of the French People." Fearing that this matter would be revealed, Bidault proposed a compromise document, asking Soustelle to personally hand it over to de Gaulle. De Gaulle immediately ordered Soustelle to inform Bidault that he would not pursue the matter, but on one condition: Bidault must make the domestic and foreign policies of the Popular Republican Movement compatible with the domestic and foreign policies of the "Rally of the French People." Bidault agreed, and the two sides reached an agreement.
    According to the Paris Observer cited by the Teletype Agency: Because this scandal has been exposed, it is difficult for the Popular Republican Movement to allow Bidault to continue to maintain its leadership position under public scrutiny.

　　法国反动分子丑态毕露
    皮杜尔戴高乐狼狈为奸
    皮杜尔曾贪污巨款充结婚费用
    【新华社讯】据电通社巴黎二十日讯，曾任法国总理和外交部长的人民共和党（天主教党）主席皮杜尔，最近因为其贪污以及与法西斯头子戴高乐狼狈为奸的丑闻泄露，而声名狼藉。
    皮杜尔在法国解放时，是抵抗委员会主席。当时他曾利用职位，盗用了从伦敦方面来的属于抵抗运动的三千五百万法郎，而在一九四六年，他又在结婚时盗用了当时从戴高乐那里来的，原来属于抵抗运动的一千五百万法郎，购买豪华的礼物送给他的妻子。皮杜尔的这些劣迹曾被一度领导戴高乐的特务机关而现在任戴高乐派法西斯组织“法兰西人民联盟”总书记的苏斯戴尔所发现。皮杜尔为了害怕这件事被泄露，就提出双方妥协的文件，请苏斯戴尔亲自交给戴高乐。戴高乐当即命令苏斯戴尔通知皮杜尔说：他决不追究此事，但是有一个条件，即皮杜尔必须使人民共和党的内政、外交政策与“法兰西人民联盟”的内政、外交政策相配合。皮杜尔答应了，于是双方达成协议。
    据电通社引巴黎观察家称：由于这一丑闻已经泄露，人民共和党已很难在众目睽睽下再让皮杜尔继续保持其领导地位。
