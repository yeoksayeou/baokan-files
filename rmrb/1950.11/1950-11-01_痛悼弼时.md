　　Mourning Bi Shi
　　Chen Congying
Comrade Bi Shi, you passed away at a time when you should not have! This is a great loss to the Party and the people. As your wife, comrade, and student, I feel unspeakable grief! However, your revolutionary spirit of infinite loyalty to the Party and the people will live on forever, the great education you gave us will live on forever, you are immortal!

You were a model revolutionary worker, a model Communist Party member. Your thirty years of revolutionary work have set a shining example for us. You taught us not only with words but also with practical actions whom to love and whom to hate; you taught us how to live seriously, work selflessly, and study tirelessly; you taught us how to overcome difficulties, persevere in battle, and despise the enemy, how to be unyielding under the enemy's cruel torture; you taught us how to dedicate all our wisdom, talent, and energy to the revolutionary cause of the Party and the people!

You grew up in a poor family, and you loved labor and your laboring mother from an early age. When you were eight or nine years old, studying at a primary school ten miles away from home, you already knew how to help your mother with chores. During vacations, you would cook for your mother, but you didn't know how to wash rice, so your mother would wash the rice at night. When she woke up the next morning, you had already cooked the rice. You not only loved labor but also loved learning. You liked to write when you were four or five years old. The table was too high for you, so you would put a small stool on a large stool and sit on the small stool to write. You graduated from primary school at the age of ten, and then you carried your own bag and followed your father to Changsha, ninety miles away, to attend middle school. The weather was hot and the road was long, and your feet blistered, but you endured the pain and didn't say a word, afraid that your father would be upset if he knew. You cherished your father's heart as you cherished your mother's heart. During your middle school years, your family could only afford to give you one string of money (equivalent to one hundred copper coins) per semester. You didn't waste a single coin, and you washed your own clothes in your spare time. Because of family financial difficulties, you were unable to continue your studies, so you decided to go to France for work-study. Later, you missed the opportunity, but soon after, you finally went to the Soviet Union to study at the Eastern University.

After returning to China in 1924, you were responsible for the work of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and also taught Russian at Shanghai University. The following year, you planned to go home to see your elderly parents and bring me out. The ship ticket was bought, and the luggage was moved onto the ship. At this time, you suddenly received a notice from the organization to go to Beijing for a meeting. Without hesitation, you obeyed the organization's decision and immediately moved the luggage to another ship and went to Beijing.

When Comrade Wang Yifei, entrusted by you, brought me to Shanghai, you had also returned to Shanghai from Beijing. You lived in a small attic room, which had nothing except a bed, a table, and a bookshelf. You had to do practical revolutionary work and also find time to teach, without any spare time at all. Under the threat of white terror, you had to move frequently and often lived on flatbread and fried dough sticks. It wasn't until after we got married that I started cooking. I was doing secret transportation work, using a mimeograph. Sometimes you didn't come back until dawn, and I had to wait to open the door for you and get you something to eat. But you never wanted me to cook, often just drinking some plain water. After sleeping for two or three hours, you would get up and go out to work again. Every time I saw you go out in an old gray cotton robe, I was deeply moved. You dedicated all your time and energy to revolutionary work. You could encounter danger on the road at any time, and you often encountered police and secret agents "picking targets," but thanks to your wit and composure, no accidents occurred.

In October 1928, you were sent to Anqing, Wuhu, and other places to inspect work. You were arrested while attending a meeting in Nanling. On the ship being escorted to Wuhu, you managed to send me a letter, telling me your confession, saying that you were an apprentice in my fifth elder brother's paper shop in Changsha. The Party also knew that you had been arrested, and the Party led me to rescue you. I carried the child on a coal train to Changsha, and coal fell on the child's head, drawing blood. When we arrived in Changsha, my child's and my hands were frozen. I remember very clearly that this child got sick and died after your release from prison when we met in Shanghai!

You suffered all kinds of torture in prison. After being severely beaten, you were also put in stocks. You clenched your teeth and endured it, and you didn't tell half a truth even when you fainted. You cherished the Party far more than your own life, and the Party cherished you as a loving mother cherishes her good son. The Party tried every possible way to rescue you.

When we met in Shanghai, your body was completely ruined. The torture had devastated your health. But you didn't even think about resting. You didn't rest for a single day, looking for documents to read, looking for materials to study, to quickly catch up on what you hadn't seen during your time in prison. You worked day and night, sometimes not returning until three or four in the morning, never getting enough sleep.

Six months after your release from prison, you were arrested again in Shanghai. That morning, it was raining heavily, and you went out to a meeting. You said you would be back for lunch at twelve o'clock and would have to go out to another meeting in the afternoon. I waited until twelve o'clock, but you didn't come back; waited until one, two, three... until early the next morning, you still hadn't come back. I rushed to Comrade Luo Mai's place to inquire, and he said that you had been arrested and that the Party was trying to rescue you. This time you suffered all kinds of torture again. The enemy not only beat you severely and kicked you hard, but also used electric shocks several times. There were two large holes in your back that hadn't healed even after three months. You didn't confess anything, and the Party once again led me to try every possible way to rescue you.

After your second release from prison, you were transferred to work in Hankou. At that time, the white terror was so severe. Most of the thirty-plus comrades sent by the Party to work in Hankou were arrested and killed. They were all led by you, and in order to protect the Party and protect you, they would rather die than reveal your address. We must always commemorate these heroic martyrs who used their lives to exchange for the Party's glory and your safety.

In March 1931, the Party sent you to the Jiangxi Central Revolutionary Base to serve as a member of the Central Bureau and Minister of the Organization Department. A week after you left, I gave birth to a child. Soon after, due to the betrayal of a traitor, I was arrested. I was imprisoned in a damp cell with the newborn child, and mosquitoes swarmed to bite me and the child. The enemy interrogated me many times, threatening me, but I always maintained the Party's purity and glory. After that traitor was finally killed because he didn't gain the enemy's trust, my child and I were taken to Longhua Prison to feed bedbugs. The enemy interrogated me many times, threatening me, but I still didn't confess anything. Under your long-term direct guidance, it was absolutely impossible for me to bow my head in front of the enemy!

After my release from prison, I received telegrams from Vice Chairman Zhou of the Central Soviet Area and you, asking me to go there. For the sake of the difficulty of the journey and the convenience of work, I had to hand over the child who had been imprisoned with me to your old home.

I remember meeting you in Changting during the International Women's Day in 1932. You had already heard the news of my arrest, and you said you were very sad at the time, but it didn't affect your work. We are revolutionary couples, both children of the Party. Our love is melted into the love for the Party and the people.

Soon the Party Central Committee moved from Yidu, Jiangxi, to Tingzhou, Fujian, and later to Ruijin. Under the enemy's blockade, there was no grain, no salt, and the lives of us and all the comrades were very difficult. You didn't get enough sleep, often got sick, and were terribly thin. But you never saw yourself as a patient, still working day and night. In the case of material difficulties throughout the area, I was afraid that you would not be able to hold on, so I had to sell a few clothes that I had worn from the White Area to buy some eggs for you to eat. In such a difficult living and stressful working environment, you did not forget to study and often told me not to forget to study. You said that this is our own area and we can study without any worries.

In May 1933, we were assigned to work in the Xianggan Border Area, and you served as the Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and Political Commissar of the Xianggan Military Region. In July of the following year, the Sixth Red Army broke through. I had given birth to a child just three months before. Enemy planes constantly bombed, and we couldn't walk during the day. We marched at night, crossing mountains and rivers, and the roads after the rain were all slippery mud. The enemy surrounded us from several directions, and we encountered great difficulties. We walked like this for several months, and your body was getting worse and worse. Although you were a military political commissar, your life was exactly the same as that of ordinary soldiers. Although your body was getting worse day by day, your spirit was always so cheerful! No matter what difficulties and dangers we encountered, you were always so calm. I remember once, you were very sick, and while you were getting an injection, the enemy came. We urgently crossed the river, and our whole bodies were splashed with river water. But I couldn't see the slightest panic on your face.

After the Second Front Army joined forces with the Fourth Front Army in Ganzi, Xikang, you, along with the Commander-in-Chief and many other comrades, fought against the traitor Zhang Guotao, enabling the entire Second Front Army and part of the Fourth Front Army to successfully reach northern Shaanxi and join forces with the First Front Army. I remember that in 1927, you led the Communist Youth League in the struggle against Chen Duxiu's opportunist line, actively supporting the Party's revolutionary line. You were good at uniting people, but you first insisted on principles and resolutely opposed unprincipled accommodation.

After passing Ganzi, I gave birth to a child on the Aba grassland. I had nothing to eat after giving birth, only grass. The Commander-in-Chief and you actually personally fished for me to eat. The great comradely love warmed my heart like the spring sun.

In 1936, the Shaanxi-Gansu base area in northern Shaanxi was relatively consolidated, and the female comrades in Xikang all went there. I carried the child and separated from you. Soon after, we met again in northern Shaanxi. You often caught colds and toothaches in Yan'an, and you persisted in working despite your illness. After the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang invaded Yan'an in the first half of 1947, you and Chairman Mao and other central responsible comrades stayed in northern Shaanxi together. Your blood pressure was getting higher and higher every day at that time. You worked with illness in Yangjiagou, Mizhi, northern Shaanxi, studying land problems for several months and made a report on the land reform issue. After Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army was crushed in northern Shaanxi, you went to Pingshan, Hebei. You were already very ill, and you participated in the Second Plenary Session of the Party in Pingshan despite your illness, and successively presided over the National Women's Congress and the National Youth Congress in Beijing. You fainted while giving a political report at the Youth Congress, and only then did you go to rest. Your health improved this year, and you immediately asked to work again. The Party, with the consent of the doctor, gave you a small amount of work, but you did too much and thought too much! You were preparing for next year's organizational meeting, gathering the secretaries of the Wu'an County Party Committee and village branch secretaries of Handan to talk. You were studying the situation in Korea, and you were still looking at the Korean map on the eve of your death. You earnestly warned us to be thrifty, often asking whether our food costs exceeded the standard. You were so loyal to the cause of the Party and the people, so concerned about protecting the country's property, and so concerned about the anti-imperialist struggle of friendly neighboring countries!

Comrade Bi Shi! With a heart full of grief, I swear to you: I will definitely accept your last words, learn from your example, wholeheartedly dedicate myself to the people's revolutionary cause, and resolutely participate in the struggle against the US imperialist aggression! I will definitely take good care of my children and let them inherit your legacy and your cause. Rest in peace!

　　痛悼弼时
    陈琮英
    弼时同志，你在不应该逝世的时候逝世了！这是党和人民的大损失。作为你的妻子、同志和学生的我，有说不出的悲痛！然而你对党、对人民无限忠诚的革命精神永在，你给我们的伟大教育永在，你是不朽的！
    你是模范革命工作者，模范共产党员。你三十年如一日的革命工作，给我们树立了一个光辉的榜样。你不但以语言文字而且以实际行动教导我们爱什么人，恨什么人；教导我们如何严肃地生活，忘我地工作，孜孜不倦地学习；教导我们如何克服困难，坚持战斗，藐视敌人，在敌人的严刑拷打下不屈不挠；教导我们如何把毕生的全部智慧、才能和精力献给党和人民革命事业！
    你生长在贫困的家庭，你从小爱劳动，爱劳动的母亲。你八九岁在离家十里路外的一个小学里念书的时候，便知道怎样为你母亲代劳了。假期回家，你代母亲做饭，但不会洗米，要母亲晚上把米洗好。等她第二天早晨起来的时候，你已经把饭煮熟了。你不但爱劳动，而且爱学习，你四五岁便喜欢写字了。台子对于你太高了，你便把小凳子放在大凳子上，于是坐在小凳子上写。你十岁便在小学毕业了，于是自己背着包袱，跟着父亲到九十里路外的长沙进中学。天热路长，你的脚底起泡了，但你忍住痛，一声不响，怕你父亲知道，心里难过。你像爱护母亲的心一样爱护父亲的心。在中学时期，家里每学期只能供给你一吊钱（合一百个铜板），你一个小钱都不乱用，衣服都是自己抽时间洗的。你因为家庭经济困难，无法升学，决定到法国去勤工俭学，后来错过了机会，但不久以后，你终于到苏联进东方大学学习了。
    你在一九二四年回国后，即负责团中央的工作，同时又在上海大学教俄文。第二年你准备回家看看老父母，并接我出来。船票买好了，行李也搬到船上了。这时你突然接到组织的通知，要你到北京开会。你毫不游移地服从组织的决定，马上把行李搬到另一只船上，到北京去了。
    当王一飞同志接受你的委托，把我带到上海的时候，你也从北京回到上海了。你住在小亭子间里，除了一张床，一张桌，一个书架，简直没有什么了。你做实际革命工作，还得抽时间教书，没有一点儿空。在白色恐怖的威胁下，你得常常搬家，常常吃大饼油条过日，直到我们结婚以后，才由我做饭吃。我做的是秘密交通工作，搞油印。你有时天亮才回来，我要等着给你开门。给你弄饭吃。但你总不要我弄饭，常常喝些白开水便算了。你睡了两三小时，又要起来出去工作了。我每次看你穿一件灰色旧棉袍出门去了，总是深受感动。你把全部时间和精力都交给了革命工作。你在马路上随时都可能碰到危险，你常常碰到巡捕和暗探“抄靶子”，但由于你的机智和镇静，没有发生什么事故。
    一九二八年十月间，你被派到安庆芜湖等地去巡视工作，在南陵开会时被捕了。你在被押解到芜湖去的船上设法带信给我，把你的口供告诉了我，说你是长沙我五哥的纸店里的学徒。党也知道你被捕了，党领导我营救你。我抱着孩子搭乘煤车赶往长沙，煤块落在孩子的头上，一片鲜血。到了长沙，我和孩子的手都冻坏了。我记得很清楚，这个孩子在你出狱后我们在上海会面时病了，死了！
    你在监狱里受尽苦刑。毒打之后，又上过杠子。你咬紧牙关忍受了，昏过去也不说半句真话。你爱护党远远超过爱护自己的生命，党爱护你也像慈母爱护自己的好儿子一样。党想尽办法把你营救出来。
    我们在上海会面的时候，你的身体坏透了。毒刑糟踏了你的健康。但你连想也没有想到休养。你一天都不休息，到处找文件看，找材料看，要加速度地补看你在牢里那一段时间没有看到的东西。你日夜工作，有时深夜三四点钟才回来，从来没有过足够的睡眠。
    出狱后六个月，你又在上海被捕了。那天早晨，落着大雨，你出门开会去了。你说十二点钟回来吃中饭，下午还得出外开会。我等到十二点钟，你没有回来；等到一点、二点、三点、……直到第二天清早，你还没有回来。我赶到罗迈同志处去打听消息，他说你被捕了，党正在设法营救你。你这一次又受尽了苦刑。敌人不但毒打你，狠狠地踢你，还用过好几次电刑。你背上两个大窟窿，直到三个月后还没有痊愈。你没有一点口供，党又一次领导我想尽办法把你营救出来。
    第二次出狱后，你被调到汉口工作。那时白色恐怖多厉害呀。党派到汉口工作的三十多位同志，绝大多数都被捕、被杀了。他们都是你领导的，他们为了爱护党、爱护你，宁死不说出你的住址。我们要永远纪念这些英勇牺牲的烈士，他们曾用自己的生命来换取党的光荣和你的安全。
    一九三一年三月，党派你到江西中央革命根据地担任中央局委员兼组织部部长。你走后一星期，我生了孩子。不久之后，由于叛徒的出卖，我被捕了。我抱着出生不久的孩子被押在潮湿的牢房里，蚊子成群结队地咬着我和孩子。敌人多次审问我，威胁我，我始终保持着党的纯洁和光荣。那个叛徒因得不到敌人的信任而终于被杀之后，我和孩子又被解到龙华牢狱去喂臭虫了。敌人又多次审问我，威胁我，我依然没有供出什么。在你长期的直接教导下的我，是绝对不可能在敌人面前低头的！
    我出狱后接到中央苏区周副主席和你的电报，叫我到那里去。为了旅途的艰难和工作的方便，我不得不把跟我一同坐过牢的孩子交给你的老家。
    我记得在长汀碰到你的时候，正是一九三二年的国际妇女节。你早已听到我被捕的消息，你说当时非常难过，但没有影响过你的工作。我们是革命的夫妇，同是党的儿女。我们的爱情是融化在对党对人民的爱情里的。
    不久党中央从江西宜都迁到福建汀州，后来又迁到瑞金。在敌人的封锁下，没有粮，没有盐，我们和全体同志们的生活都是很苦的。你睡眠不足，常常生病，瘦得可怕。但你从来不把自己看作病人，依然日夜工作。在整个区域都感物质困难的情况下，我怕你支持不下去，只好卖了几件从白区穿进去的衣服，买些鸡蛋给你吃。在这样生活困难和工作紧张的环境下，你并没忘掉学习，并经常告诉我不要忘掉学习。你说这里是自己的地区，可以毫无顾虑地进行学习。
    一九三三年五月间，我们被分配到湘赣边区工作，你担任省委书记兼湘赣军区政治委员。第二年七月红六军突围，我刚在三个月前生了孩子。敌人的飞机不断轰炸，白天不能走路。夜间行军，翻山过水，雨后的道路全是湿滑的泥浆。敌人从几方面包围我们，我们碰到了很大的困难。我们这样走了好几个月，你的身体越来越坏了。你虽然是军政治委员，你的生活却完全跟一般战士的生活一样。你的身体虽然一天天坏下去，你的精神始终是那么愉快！不管碰到怎样的困难和危险，你总是那样的镇定。记得有一次，你病得很厉害，正在打针时，敌人来了。紧急抢渡过河，我们全身都被河水溅湿了。但我在你脸上看不出一丝一毫的惊慌。
    红二方面军在西康的甘孜与红四方面军会合后，你与总司令及其他许多同志一起反对叛徒张国焘的斗争，使第二方面军全体和第四方面军一部分顺利到达陕北，与第一方面军会师。记得在一九二七年，你曾领导青年团进行反对陈独秀的机会主义路线的斗争，积极拥护党的革命路线。你是善于团结人的，但你首先坚持原则，坚决反对无原则的迁就。
    过了甘孜，我便在阿巴草地上生了孩子。我产后什么都没得吃，只能吃草，总司令和你竟亲自钓鱼给我吃。伟大的同志爱，真像春天的阳光一样温暖了我的心。
    一九三六年陕北根据地已比较巩固，在西康的女同志们都到那里去。我背着孩子同你分别了。不久以后，我们又在陕北会面了。你在延安常常感冒，常常牙痛，你在病中始终坚持工作。一九四七年上半年蒋介石匪帮进犯延安后，你和毛主席等中央负责同志一同留在陕北。你那时的血压一天天高了。你带病在陕北米脂杨家沟研究土地问题，研究了好几个月，做了一个关于土地改革问题的报告。蒋介石匪军在陕北被粉碎以后，你到了河北的平山。你已经病得很厉害了，你带病在平山参加了党的二中全会，又在北京先后主持全国妇女代表大会和全国青年代表大会。你在青年代表大会上做政治报告时昏倒了，这才去休养的。今年你的健康有了好转，你又马上要求工作。党征得医生的同意给你少量的工作，但你做得太多了，想得太多了！你准备明年的组织会议，召集邯郸武安县委书记和村支部书记来谈话。你研究朝鲜的战局，你在逝世的前夕还在看朝鲜地图。你谆谆告诫我们要节约，常常问我们的菜金有没有超过标准。你是这样尽忠于党和人民的事业，这样受护国家的资财，这样关切友邻国家的反帝斗争！
    弼时同志！我带着满怀的悲痛向你宣誓：我一定接受你的遗教，学习你的榜样，全心全意献身于人民革命事业，坚决参加反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争！我一定要好好抚育子女，让他们继承你的遗志，继承你的事业。你安息吧！
