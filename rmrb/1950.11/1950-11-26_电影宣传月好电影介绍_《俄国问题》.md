　　Movie Promotion Month Good Movie Introduction
    "The Russian Question"

    "...The question of attitude towards the Soviet Union - is the question of being friendly to the Soviet Union or hostile to the Soviet Union. This question can be used to test the beliefs of everyone in the world. All progressive people in the world advocate friendship with the Soviet Union, and all reactionaries in the world advocate hostility towards the Soviet Union..." These are a few words from Simonov in an article about writing "The Russian Question."

    "The Russian Question" does not attack the American people; what it exposes is the ugly face of Wall Street's warmongers. The good nature of the American people is praised in this film. The protagonist, Smith, is such a person—an ordinary, true American, a journalist who refuses to be bought by Wall Street. He is not a communist. His actions, his desires, and his experiences represent the actions, desires, and experiences of the American people.

    The Soviet people do not need war, and the American people do not need war. Those who need war, clamor for war, and launch aggression are the "McPhersons"—that small group of Wall Street financial oligarchs and their servants. Slander against the Soviet Union and wars of aggression are not welcomed by the people but are hated and opposed by the people. Defending world peace is sincerely supported by the vast majority of people around the world. All slanders against the Soviet Union and the people of the world will collapse without being attacked. Thus, the inevitable fate of the warmongers—heading towards death—is destined. "The Russian Question" expresses this.

    "The Russian Question" writes precisely about the American question. Through it, the audience can clearly understand the reactionary essence of American imperialism and the ugly face of the warmongers. "The Russian Question" will educate everyone to be vigilant against the rumors and slanders of American imperialism, and it will also educate those who still have the slightest illusions and incorrect estimates about American imperialism. Today, when the call to resist America and aid Korea has come from the people of the whole country, "The Russian Question" will be the best teaching material for us to recognize the enemy. Let all the "McPherson's" newspapers "Life," "Voice of America"...go bankrupt before us! Let all slander, deception, and intimidation be shattered before us! Let the American "paper tiger" be smashed by the iron fists of the people!

    "The Russian Question" is unparalleled in its function of defending world peace and opposing wars of aggression.

    《俄国问题》
    “……对苏联态度的问题——就是对苏友好，还是对苏仇视的问题。这问题是可以用来考验世界上每一个人的信念的。世界上全体进步人士是主张对苏友好的，世界上一切反动分子是主张对苏仇视的。……”这就是西蒙诺夫在一篇关于写作《俄国问题》的文章里的几句话。
    《俄国问题》不是攻击美国人民的，它所要暴露的是华尔街战争贩子的嘴脸。美国人民的善良本质在这个片子中得到了表扬。主人公史密斯就是这样的一个人——一个普通的真正的美国人，一个拒绝华尔街收买的美国记者，他并不是共产党员。他的行为，他的愿望和他的遭遇，正代表着美国人民的行为，愿望和遭遇的。
    苏联人不需要战争，美国人民不需要战争，需要战争的，叫嚣战争与发动侵略的是“麦克非森”们——那一小撮华尔街金融寡头和他们的仆从。对苏联的污蔑及侵略战争不为人民所欢迎而为人民所厌弃反对，保卫世界和平为全世界广大人民所衷心拥护，一切对苏联及世界人民的污蔑将不攻自破。这样，就注定了战争贩子的必然命运——走向死亡。《俄国问题》就表现了这个。
    《俄国问题》写的正是美国问题。通过它使观众能清楚的认识美帝国主义的反动本质，战争贩子的嘴脸。《俄国问题》将教育着大家警惕美帝的造谣污蔑，也将教育那些对美帝仍存有丝毫幻想和不正确估计的人，在抗美援朝的呼声已出自全国人民之口的今日，《俄国问题》将是使我们认清敌人的最好的教材。让一切“麦克非森”的报纸“生活”、“美国之音”……在我们面前破产吧！让一切污蔑、欺骗和恐吓在我们面前粉碎吧！让美国“纸老虎”被人民的铁拳打烂吧！
    《俄国问题》在保卫世界和平，反对侵略战争的功能上是无与伦比的。
