Xinhua News Agency, November 15th dispatch: TASS, Prague dispatch: The Press Office of the Preparatory Committee for the Second World Peace Congress has issued a communiqué regarding the relocation of the congress venue to Warsaw, stating:

    The congress has completed the enormous and complex preparatory work caused by the change of the congress venue in a short period and ensured the normal progress of the congress work in Warsaw. This fact once again demonstrates the great strength and selfless spirit of the peace fighters.

    The communiqué continued: Attlee firmly prevented the congress from being held in Sheffield. Forty-eight hours before the opening of the congress, when two thousand delegates from seventy-three countries were en route to England, the British government blatantly erected an iron curtain on the border, which blatantly undermined the basic principles of democracy.

    However, the international peace movement cannot be restricted by Attlee's police measures. Attlee did not consider that the delegates to the congress express the wishes of hundreds of millions of people who support peace. Every delegate knows his full responsibility and the greatness of his mission, which is where the invincible strength of the peace camp lies. No obstacle can limit this force; moreover, the strength of the peace movement is gradually increasing.

    The communiqué continued: With the consent of the Polish government, the congress will be held in Warsaw. Despite various difficulties, all 1,500 delegates have traveled by plane to attend the meeting within three days. The communiqué expressed its firm belief that the working people of Warsaw will ensure the normal and smooth progress of the congress and will hold it even more grandly than it would have been held in Sheffield. All conditions for the exchange of views between delegates will be guaranteed at the congress in Warsaw. Every speech will be simultaneously translated into seven languages. The congress will have 250 translators working, and 800 people will guarantee the technical services of the congress.

    The communiqué concluded: Attlee thought he could disintegrate and disrupt the work of the congress. But he will see that his plan has met with shameful failure. In Warsaw, the strong will of the people for peace and unity will be expressed more firmly than before.

    Xinhua News Agency, November 15th dispatch: Compiled from TASS, Moscow dispatches: The Pravda continuously published two communications from its Warsaw correspondent, Makarenko, on the 13th and 14th, reporting on the Polish people's warm welcome to the delegates to the Second World Peace Congress, stating: The British government's sinister attempt to obstruct the convening of the Second World Peace Congress has failed. The Polish Committee for the Defense of Peace has invited all delegates to come to Poland to participate in the congress, regardless of their political views and religious beliefs, and regardless of their political parties and social positions. The Polish democratic government extends a warm welcome to all active peace fighters.

    The Polish people believe that the invitation of the Polish Committee for the Defense of Peace represents the will of the people of the whole country. The resolutions passed at hundreds of mass rallies held throughout Poland, as well as the letters to the Second World Peace Congress and Polish President Bierut, show their anger at the actions of the British government and their warmest congratulations and hopes to the delegates to the World Peace Congress.

    The work of welcoming the opening of the congress is proceeding tensely. The Polish government is taking vigorous measures to ensure the greatest success of the World Peace Congress. All cities and villages, railway stations and ports in Poland are filled with flags and slogans celebrating the opening of the congress. Huge portraits of Stalin, the flag-bearer of world peace, are hung in the most prominent places. In Warsaw, as well as on the way to Warsaw for the delegations from various countries, the working people will hold countless demonstrations and rallies to defend peace. They will hold up flags and flowers to welcome the delegates from various countries. Delegations from the Soviet Union, China, and Korea have arrived in Warsaw amid the warm welcome of the Polish people.

    Makarenko emphasized: Just as no force in the world can stop the powerful peace movement, no force in the world can obstruct the convening of the Second World Peace Congress.

    二届世界和大筹委会发表公报
    千五百名代表全往华沙赴会
    波兰人民举国动员保证大会顺利进行
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社布拉格讯：第二届世界保卫和平大会筹备委员会新闻处，顷发表关于大会会址移往华沙的公报称：
    大会已在短促的时期内，完成了因大会会址的改变而引起的巨大复杂的筹备工作，并保证大会工作在华沙正常进行。这一事实又一次表明了和平战士们的巨大的力量和忘我的精神。
    公报继称：艾德礼坚阻大会在设菲尔德举行。在大会开幕之前四十八小时，当七十三个国家的两千名代表已在赴英途中的时候，英国政府竟在边境上张起了铁幕，这就明目张胆地破坏了民主的基本原则。
    但是，国际和平运动不是艾德礼用警察措施所能限制得了的。艾德礼没有考虑到：大会代表所表达的是亿万拥护和平的人民的愿望。每一个代表都知道他的全部责任及他的使命的伟大，这就是和平阵营的不可战胜的力量所在。没有任何障碍能够限制这股力量，不仅如此，和平运动的力量还在逐步增长。
    公报继称：大会在波兰政府的同意下，即将在华沙举行。尽管有种种困难，但一千五百名代表已全部在三天之内乘飞机前往赴会。公报表示深信华沙的劳动人民将保证大会工作正常顺利地进行，并将比在设菲尔德举行得更加隆重。在华沙举行的大会上，代表间交换意见的一切条件将得到保证。每篇演说将同时翻译成七种语言。大会将有二百五十名翻译人员工作，并将有八百人保证大会的技术服务。
    公报结语说：艾德礼以为他可以瓦解与扰乱大会的工作。但是他将看到他的计划已经遭到可耻的失败。在华沙，人民希望和平与团结的坚强意志，将比以前更加坚定地表示出来。
    【新华社十五日讯】综合塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于十三日及十四日连续刊载该报驻华沙记者马卡伦科的两篇通讯，报道波兰人民热烈欢迎第二届世界和大代表的情况称：英国政府阻挠第二届世界和大召开的罪恶图谋，已告失败，大会已改在华沙召开。波兰拥护和平委员会已邀请所有的代表前来波兰参加大会，不论其政治见解和宗教信仰如何，亦不论其所属政党与社会立场，波兰的民主政府对一切积极的和平战士均表示热烈欢迎。
    波兰人民认为波兰拥护和平委员会的邀请，表现了举国人民的意志。在全波兰举行的数百次群众大会上所通过的决议，以及给第二届和大与波兰总统贝鲁特的信，表明他们对英国政府的行动的愤怒和对世界和大代表的最热忱的祝贺与希望。
    迎接和大开幕的工作正紧张进行中。波兰政府正采取有力的措施，以保证世界和大获得最大的成功。波兰的一切城市和乡村，火车站和港口，都布满庆祝大会开幕的各色旗帜和标语牌。全世界和平的旗手斯大林的巨幅画像，高悬在最引人注目的地方，在华沙以及在各国代表团赴华沙的途中，劳动人民将举行无数次保卫和平的示威和集会，他们将高举着旗帜和鲜花，来欢迎各国的代表。苏联、中国和朝鲜的代表团，已在波兰人民的热情的欢迎中抵达华沙。
    马卡伦科强调称：正象世界上没有一种力量能够阻止强大的和平运动一样，世界上也没有一种力量能够阻挠第二届世界保卫和平大会的召开。
