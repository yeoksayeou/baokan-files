To Uncle Li Yu, Older Brother Dong Liu, and Comrade Shuchun:

During the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement, I particularly miss you.

It has been a full nine years since you died under the bayonets of the Japanese invaders!

Your unyielding national integrity, along with that of countless revolutionary martyrs, educated the broad masses of the Chinese people and won freedom and happiness from the revolutionary war. However, today the American bandits have launched a war of aggression, massacring the Korean people in large numbers, and are increasingly bringing the flames of war closer to the borders of our motherland. Every time I mourn your noble qualities of being steadfast and fearless in the face of the enemy, and your seeing death as going home, I am reminded of the ferocity, brutality, and baseness of the imperialists. Deep hatred has transformed into endless power within me. For nine years, I have been following in your bloody footsteps, seeking revenge for you! Now, the ferocity of the American imperialists exceeds that of the Japanese invaders back then. With old and new hatreds combined, I remember the great example you set for the living: a profound love for the motherland.

June 24, 1941—this is the day I will never forget for the rest of my life. At that time, I was working as a village cadre in our village, and in order to keep the various secrets of the struggle against the enemy, I changed my name to "Heren." That day, the weather was as hot as a blazing fire. In the afternoon, as soon as I stepped out of my house, I heard the sentry on the roof of the house west of the village shout, "Run! Run!" I knew the Japanese devils were coming. Immediately, all the villagers, with hatred in their hearts, carrying their sons and daughters, quickly plunged into the green cornfields north of the village. At this point, I felt relieved, so I followed them in. It was at this moment that you, Second Uncle, Lao Dong, and Shuchun, were tied up by the Japanese devils in the sorghum stalks east of the village, and subjected to all kinds of torture, abuse, questioning…

"If you don't tell us where the 'Eighth Route Army' is, we'll let you taste the bayonet!" a running dog shouted wildly, holding a gleaming bayonet aimed at Second Uncle's bare chest.

"Don't know!" Second Uncle puffed out his chest, and the three of you shouted out simultaneously. The Japanese devil was stunned and thrust the entire bayonet into Second Uncle's chest, asking with eyes full of ferocity, "You old thing, will you talk! Who exactly is 'Heren'?"

"Heren? Heren is the one who will wipe you out! Just wait!" Second Uncle's voice shook the fields. After speaking, you fell heroically! The Japanese devil pulled out the bayonet and, like a madman, aimed it at Sixth Brother. The blood on the blade dripped onto Sixth Brother's waistband. At this time, Sixth Brother, your chest was filled with hatred, and you didn't say a word, your teeth gnashing. The Japanese devil roared again, stabbing your chest five times in a row, yet you still stood like steel! Not uttering a sound in front of the enemy, not even frowning! Fresh, red blood spurted from your abdomen, and your face turned from iron blue to pale. To protect any secrets of the anti-Japanese work, relying on your determination to fight the enemy, you also gloriously fell into Second Uncle's blood.

"It's your turn! Do you want to live or not!" The blood-red bayonet pressed closely against Shuchun again.

"Want to live?! Only if we wipe you all out!" You raised your head, glared angrily, staring at the enemy. At this time, three Japanese devils and their running dog shouted and stabbed you wildly. One Japanese devil deliberately slowly stabbed your abdomen, while viciously shaking the hilt of the knife, questioning you to confess. You closed your eyes tightly, gritted your teeth, and in this way, did not reveal the slightest secret. You were only silently thinking about the Party's education for you, and the noble integrity that a Party member should express in front of the enemy. You were about to stop breathing, your left hand holding onto a sorghum stalk, your right hand clenched into a fist, leaning your body against the tree, and shouted so loudly, "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!"

You fell one after another like this, unyielding! Falling on the blood-soaked ground, falling on a bright red flag.

When we sorrowfully listened to Li Zhao report the details of your heroic sacrifice, the enemy set fire to Wangjiadianzi, three miles away from our village, burning the big village of more than two hundred households to the ground. Second Uncle, Lao Dong, Shuchun: our deep-seated hatred is endless and countless. In the anti-Japanese struggle, we went through such long and arduous years, we overcame so many difficulties that had never been seen in history. Wives and children were separated, families were destroyed, mothers shed countless tears, children shed countless blood, falling thousands of times, getting up ten thousand times to continue the struggle! In this way, we have achieved today's free and happy life. How should we cherish this sun and moon bought with the flesh and blood of millions of people!

Today, the murderous clutches of the American imperialists have once again extended to our door. It wants to retrace the old path of the Japanese invaders, attempting to drag us into the abyss of suffering once again. Now, with a heart full of sorrow and indignation, I swear to you: I will vow to defend the motherland, defend our hard-won free and happy life, aid the Korean people, and defend world peace. When necessary, I will exchange my pen for a gun and go to the forefront of the struggle!

Dear uncles and brothers: you will always live in the hearts of the brave and strong Chinese people; your heroic deeds will also forever inspire our courage and determination to defend world peace!

　　先烈的热血不能白流
    誓死保卫祖国！
    本报特约通讯员中共玉田县委书记  武文华
    李玉叔叔、董六哥哥、树春同志：
    在抗美援朝运动中，我特别想念你们。
    在日寇的刺刀下，你们已死去整整九年了！
    你们和无数革命先烈的坚强不屈的民族气节，曾教育了广大中国人民，并从革命战争中赢得了自由和幸福。但是，今天美国强盗又发动了侵略战争，大批屠杀了朝鲜人民，并日益迫近地将战火烧向了我祖国的边疆。每当悼念起你们在敌人面前坚贞不屈、视死如归的崇高品质，就连想到帝国主义者的凶狠、残暴与卑鄙。深切的仇恨在我身上化作了无穷的力量，九年来，我一直踏着你们的血迹，为你们报仇雪恨！如今美帝的凶焰甚于当年的日寇，旧恨新仇，我又想起了你们为生者树立起的壮烈辉煌酷爱祖国的伟大典范。
    一九四一年六月二十四日——这就是使我终生不能忘记的那一天。那时我正在咱村当村干部，为了保守对敌斗争中的各项秘密，我改名“何人”。那天，天气热的像燎火。午后我刚迈出了家门，就听得村西房上的岗哨大喊“快跑啊！快跑！”。我知道这是鬼子来了。紧接着，全村老百姓都怀着仇恨的心情，携男抱女，迅速地扎入了村北的青纱帐里。这时，我放心了，于是也跟了进去。也就在这时，二叔、老董和树春你们被鬼子捆在村东的高粱棵里，经过了百般的非刑拷打、辱骂、问……
    “不说出‘八路’在那，就让你们尝尝刺刀！”一条走狗狂叫了。手中握着明晃晃的刺刀，对准了二叔赤露的胸膛。
    “不知道！”二叔挺挺胸，三个人同时喊出来。鬼子一怔神，把整个刺刀扎入了二叔的胸窝，瞪着充满了凶光的眼睛还是问：“你这个老东西，说不说！‘何人’到底是谁？”
    “何人？何人是专会消灭你们的！等着吧！”二叔的声音震撼着田野。说完，你就英勇地倒下了！鬼子抽出了刺刀，疯一般的又对准了六哥。刀上的鲜血滴在六哥的裤腰上。这时，六哥你胸中已填满了仇恨，你一言不出，牙齿咬的格吱格吱的响。鬼子又吼起来，在你的胸部连扎五刀，你仍是钢铁般的矗立着！在敌人面前不出一声，连眉头也没皱一皱！鲜红的热血从你的腹部喷出来，你的脸色由铁青变成了苍白。为了保守抗日工作中的任何秘密，凭着对敌斗争的决心，最后你也光荣地倒在二叔的血泊里了。
    “该你啦！你想活不想活！”鲜红的刺刀又紧逼着树春。
    “想活？！那除非把你们都消灭干净了！”你昂首怒目，瞪视着敌人。这时三个鬼子和他那条走狗大叫一声，把刺刀在你的身上乱扎起来。一个鬼子故意把刺刀慢慢地扎在你的腹中，一面凶残的动摇着刀把，一面追问你的口供。你，紧闭着眼睛，咬住了牙关，就这样，未曾暴露了半点秘密。你只有在默默地想着，党对你的教育，作为一个党员，在敌人面前应该表达出来的崇高气节。你将要停止呼吸了，你左手扶着高粱秸，右手握紧了拳头，把身子斜倚在树上，是那样洪亮的喊出了“中国共产党万岁！”
    你们就是这样前仆后继，坚贞不屈的倒下了！倒在血地上，倒在了一面殷红灿烂的红旗上。
    当我们哀痛地听李照报告你们英勇就义的经过时，敌人又在距咱村三里地的王家甸子放了火，把个二百多户人家的大庄，烧的片瓦不存。二叔、老董、树春：我们的血海深仇是说不尽数不完的，在抗日的战斗中，我们是经过了那样悠长艰苦的岁月，我们克服了多少历史上未曾有过的困难。妻离子散，家破人亡，母亲们不知流出了多少眼泪，儿女们不知洒尽了多少鲜血，千次跌倒，万次爬起来继续斗争！就这样，我们取得了今天自由幸福的生活。这种用千万人的血肉换得来的日月，我们应该如何的珍爱它呀！
    今天，美帝的杀人魔掌，又伸向我们的大门了。它想重走日寇的老路，企图把我们再一次拖到苦难的深渊里。现在，我满怀着悲愤的心情向你们宣誓：誓死保卫祖国，保卫我们既得的自由幸福的生活，援助朝鲜人民，保卫世界和平。必要时，我把笔杆换成枪杆，走上斗争的最前线！
    亲爱的叔叔和兄弟们：你们将永远活在勇敢坚强的中国人民的心里；你们的英勇事迹，也将永远激励着我们保卫世界和平的勇气和决心！
