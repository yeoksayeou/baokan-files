　　Never Let Them Return
　　——The Roar of Peasants Who Overturned Their Lives in the Suburbs of Beijing Against Aggression Zeng Ruixiang
　　"Imperialism is the same as the landlord class; we can't let them come back no matter what!" When I was visiting the peasants in Shuanghuaishu Administrative Village in the western suburbs of Beijing, whose lives are thriving after land reform, I heard such resolute voices every day; this is the angry voice of the hardworking and brave Chinese peasants.
　　Speaking of imperialism, people think of the "year of eating mixed flour" filled with bloodshed, terror, hunger, and death. At that time, Japanese imperialism and the traitors and landlords cruelly exploited the peasants. When the Japanese invading army first arrived in Shuanghuaishu, they cut down and killed two peasants in the village. The grain that the peasants had worked hard to harvest throughout the year was given to Japanese imperialism by the landlords and traitors. "The Japanese had so much foreign flour stored in Xizhimen and Wugudao that it was countless, with each pile as high as several houses. The peasants had strength but no place to earn money, and even if they managed to get a little money, they could only buy some mixed flour." Li Chengming, a fifty-year-old peasant, recounted the tragic life that all the men, women, and children in the village will never forget: "The mixed flour was a mixture of fifty-four kinds of miscellaneous grains and grasses, full of sheep wool. The smell when it was steamed was indescribable, like gasoline or something else. People got diarrhea after eating it. Young men would collapse and die on the road. Working as a short-term laborer for the landlord, you only got two meals a day, couldn't get paid, and had to pay the landlord two cents for pickles. Some people went to Zhangjiakou outside the pass to escape the famine. More than 300 people went, but only 200 came back. More than 100 people starved to death outside. If the peasants were slightly disrespectful to the Japanese devils, traitors, and landlords, they would be dragged to Haidian to be doused with cold water. Cold water was mixed with ground chili peppers, and pot after pot was poured into their stomachs from their noses and mouths.” Li Chengming opened his eyes wide and said indignantly: “Imperialism is really hateful! It shits on your neck, and it’s not over until it makes you eat it!”
　　The landlord class, which had always oppressed the peasants, had always colluded with imperialism, traitorous collaborators, and the Kuomintang bandits. Zheng Shaoqing, the local tyrant and landlord of Mashen Temple, relied on two traitors who worked as translators for the Japanese imperialists to obtain a fake order from the Japanese invading army to cut down all the cypress trees of the peasants in Shuanghuaishu, and used the robber method of "dispatching official cars" to force the peasants to transport them. They also relied on the reactionary forces of the enemy and puppets to seize the peasants' land. This is how the landlord class became richer and richer, and this is how the peasants of Shuanghuaishu suffered more and more!
　　The War of Resistance Against Japan was won, but the Kuomintang brought disaster again. Zhang Guozhu, a farmhand who had been carrying long-term work in the landlord's house since he was thirteen years old, said in the heaviest voice: "Before the Japanese left, the Kuomintang brought in the Americans. The Americans drove jeeps to the village every day to shoot crows and magpies. If they killed someone's dog, they would force the peasants to exchange watermelons for dead dogs. Once, the thirteen piglets of the Zhang family in Enjizhuang were all taken away by American soldiers in jeeps. When the villagers pulled carts into the city to sell vegetables, no one dared to walk through the East Legation area occupied by imperialism. Instead, they saw American cars crashing into people on the streets." From then on, the peasants of Shuanghuaishu realized: as long as it is imperialism, it is the same thing. American imperialism and Japanese imperialism oppress the Chinese people in the same way, just as there is no difference between the Zhang family landlord and the Li family landlord. Every landlord wants to exploit the peasants.
　　Since Chairman Mao and the Communist Party came, the peasants of Shuanghuaishu have truly turned themselves around. Land reform was implemented last winter. This year, under the strong leadership and assistance of the People's Government, the peasants of Shuanghuaishu have cultivated their land intensively and worked diligently with unprecedented enthusiasm, actively producing. The total output of the village this year is more than 13,718 shi of corn, an increase of 27% compared with last year, and an increase of 21% compared with the normal year's output. The lives of the peasants in the village have improved significantly. In the past, it was "If you are full today, you don't know if you can eat tomorrow, and you can't wear a new cotton-padded jacket for three years." This year it is "There is enough food for the year. Every family has old corn at home, and every family has added several new cotton clothes." Before the autumn harvest, the village added forty-three livestock and twenty carts. Just after the autumn harvest, ten more households are preparing to add livestock. The houses distributed to the poor and hired peasants have been generally renovated, and one household in Liangjiadian Natural Village is also building a new house. Every family is constantly adding farm tools. People often go to the cooperative to ask for more soybean cake, preparing to apply more fertilizer to the fields next year. Poor and hired peasants who were too poor to marry even in their old age have begun to have their own new families, and children who never had the opportunity to study are now in elementary school. Deng Fuyuan, an old farmhand living in Banbidian Natural Village, had nothing for his family of four in the past. In the land reform, he was given more than thirteen mu of land, and this year he added eleven large and small farm tools such as hoes and picks. After the autumn harvest, he just repaired the house, and then used 1.3 million yuan plus a loan of 1 million yuan from the government to buy a donkey. He also plans to spend 2.5 million yuan to buy a large cart. In September, before the weather turned cold, he bought more than fifty chi of blue cloth, and the whole family made new cotton clothes. His eldest son, Deng Jinpeng, has found a partner and will get married soon. His thirteen-year-old youngest son is also attending elementary school in the village this year.
　　Every peasant family in liberated China is following the same path: from being exploited to gaining freedom. Therefore, more than 400 million Chinese peasants who are no longer willing to be slaves will resolutely resist imperialist aggression under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government. The peasants of Shuanghuaishu Village have expressed infinite anger at the expansion of the war of aggression by the United States. During the autumn grain requisition, more than 100 households sent grain to the village office before the evaluation was completed, asking the government to accept it first, and after the democratic evaluation, "replenish if there is less, and return if there is more." The peasants all said: We will definitely resist US aggression and aid Korea with practical actions. We will never let imperialism and landlords come back. Li Chengming summed up decades of experience and said: “If imperialism cannot come in, the landlord class will not be able to become powerful. We must…”

　　绝不能再让它们回来
    ——京郊翻身农民反侵略的吼声  曾瑞祥
    “帝国主义跟地主是一码事，说什么也不能让它们再回来!”当我在北京西郊双槐树行政村访问土地改革后生活蒸蒸日上的翻身农民的时候，每天都听到这样坚决的声音；这是勤劳勇敢的中国农民的愤怒的声音。
    提起帝国主义，人们就想起充满着血腥、恐怖、饥饿和死亡的“吃混合面的那一年”。那时候，日本帝国主义和汉奸、地主残酷地压榨着农民。日寇侵略军刚到双槐树的时候，就在村里砍死了两个农民。农民辛苦终年打下来的粮食，从地主、汉奸手里送给了日本帝国主义。“日本人存在西直门和五股道的洋面多得没有数，一囤好几房高。农民有力气没地方挣钱，弄两个钱也只能买到一点混合面。”五十岁的农民李承明追述着全村男女老少都永远忘不了的悲惨的生活：“混合面是五十四种杂粮、草粮混起来的，里边尽是羊毛，蒸出来的那股子味儿说不清是汽油味还是什么味，吃了就拉稀。年青小伙子在路上走着走着倒下就死了。给地主做短工，一天只管两顿饭，拿不到工钱，还得倒找地主两毛咸菜钱。有一些人到张家口外去逃荒，去时三百多人，回来剩两百人，那一百多人全饿死在外面了。农民对日本鬼子、汉奸和地主稍稍不对劲，就被拉到海甸去灌凉水。凉水和上青椒面，一壶接一壶地从鼻子和嘴里往肚里灌。”李承明睁圆了两只眼睛愤慨地说：“帝国主义真可恨！它骑在你脖子上拉屎，拉完了还要让你吃掉才算完！”
    一向欺压农民的地主阶级和帝国主义、汉奸卖国贼、国民党匪帮从来是勾搭在一起的。马神庙的恶霸地主郑少清就依仗两个为日帝作翻译的汉奸走狗，从日帝侵略军手中取得一纸伪令把双槐树农民的柏树全部砍了，又用“派官车”的强盗办法，强迫农民运送。他们还依仗敌伪反动势力来夺取农民的土地。地主阶级就是这样越来越有钱，双槐树的农民就是这样越来越受苦！
    抗日战争胜利了，可是国民党又带来了灾难。从十三岁起就在地主家扛长活的雇农张国柱用最沉重的声音说：“日本人还没走，国民党又招来了美国人。美国人天天开着吉普车，到村里打老鸦、喜鹊。打死了人家的狗，还逼着农民拿西瓜和他换死狗。有一次，恩济庄张家的十三只小猪全被美国兵弄上吉普车抢走了。村里人拉着大车进城去卖菜没人敢走帝国主义占据的东交民巷，倒看见美国汽车在大街上乱撞人。”从此，双槐树的农民认清了：只要是帝国主义都是那么回子事，美帝国主义和日本帝国主义一样欺压中国人，正好象张家地主和李家地主并没有什么两样，是个地主就都要剥削农民。
    自从毛主席、共产党来了，双槐树的农民才真正翻了身。去年冬天实行了土地改革。今年在人民政府大力领导与扶助下，双槐树的农民用从来没有过的热情在自己土地上精耕细作，积极生产。全村今年总产量折合玉米一万三千七百一十八石多，比去年增产二成七，比常年产量也多二成一。全村农民的生活有了显著的改善。过去是“今天饱了不知明天能不能吃上，三年也穿不上一件新棉袄。”今年是“一年的粮食都有了，家家都有老玉米在家里搁着，那家也添了几件新棉衣。”秋收前全村添了牲畜四十三头，车子二十辆。秋收刚过又有十户准备添牲口。贫、雇农分到的房屋普遍新修过，亮甲店自然村还有一户在盖造新房。家家在不断地添农具，经常有人到合作社要求多供应豆饼，准备明年在地里多施肥。过去穷得几十岁还不能结婚的贫、雇农开始有了自己的新家庭，从来没有机会念书的孩子们上了小学。住在半壁店自然村的老雇农邓福元，一家四口，过去什么都没有，土改中分了十三亩多地，今年添了锄、镐等大、小农具十一件。秋收后刚刚修好了房屋，又用了一百三十万元加上政府贷给的一百万元，买了一头驴子。还准备用二百五十万元买一辆大车。九月里，天气还没凉，就买了五十多尺青布，全家都做好了新棉衣。他的大儿子邓金鹏找好了对象，不久就要结婚，十三岁的小儿子今年也在村里上了小学。
    解放后的中国的每一家农民，都是走着同一的道路：从被压榨到获得自由。因此全中国四万万以上的再也不愿做奴隶的农民要在中国共产党和人民政府领导下坚决地反抗帝国主义的侵略。双槐树村的农民对美帝扩大侵略战争，表现了无限的愤怒。他们在秋征公粮时，不等评议完毕就有一百多户把粮食送到村公所，要求政府先收下，等民主评定后“少了再补，多了再退。”农民都说：我们一定以实际行动抗美援朝，我们绝不让帝国主义和地主再回来。李承明总结了几十年的经验说：“帝国主义进不来，地主阶级也就厉害不起来，我们一定
