　　日本出席和大代表选出
    都是各界的和平运动积极分子
    【新华社一日讯】据联合通讯社消息：日本出席第二届世界保卫和平大会的各界代表，正在陆续推选中。截至十月十七日为止，北海道、宫城县、群马县、福井县、鹿儿岛县、大阪府等地的和平保卫者，都已选出了他们的代表。这些代表都是和平运动的积极分子。例如，横滨市鹤见区的高梨晃，是鹤见造船厂和平委员会的组织者。当鹤见造船厂制造运往朝鲜的二十艘登陆艇的订货时，这个和平委员会在工人中积极宣传“不造战争用的船只”，结果使登陆艇有八艘未能完成。
    工会方面的代表有：全日新闻工会的松谷仙次郎、全日大化学产业工会的龟田东伍等人。文化界的代表为：大山郁夫、坂田昌一（物理学家）、有岛生马（画家）等人。青年界代表是富士公司三鹰工厂工会会员小仓金吉。
