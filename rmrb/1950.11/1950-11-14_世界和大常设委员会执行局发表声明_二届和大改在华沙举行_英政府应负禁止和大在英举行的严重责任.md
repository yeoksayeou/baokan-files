Xinhua News Agency, 13th - According to TASS report from Paris: The Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress issued a statement on the 12th, stating: The Executive Bureau received a report on the evening of the 10th from Montagu, a representative of the British Peace Committee, along with a letter from the British Home Secretary to the British Peace Committee at 3:00 PM on the 10th. The Executive Bureau learned from the letter that almost all members of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress had been refused entry into Britain. Even before receiving the report, the Executive Bureau had learned that two hundred of the four hundred representatives who had applied for entry visas had been rejected.

　　Aircraft intended to carry the delegates to the Congress had also been arbitrarily cancelled by the British government. The British government had taken discriminatory measures against the Executive Bureau. Many leaders in political, religious, cultural, scientific, and literary circles, such as Nenni, Laffead, Xiao San, Fadeyev, and Ehrenburg, were refused entry.

　　The Chairman of the Executive Bureau, Joliot-Curie, was arrested and deported by British police upon arriving in Dover, England. The Executive Bureau strongly protests this intolerable act of insult.

　　The statement continued: Not satisfied with refusing to issue entry visas to important representatives of individual delegations attending the Congress, the British government is also attempting to obstruct the realization of the wishes expressed by people all over the world. People all over the world hope that representatives from the Americas and Western European countries can gather together with representatives from the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and representatives from various People's Democratic countries, to jointly seek solutions to the coexistence of different systems, while respecting the national independence of all peoples. To this end, the Executive Bureau must declare that, in the current serious international situation, the British government must bear the grave responsibility for effectively banning the Second World Peace Congress from being held in Britain. This decision by the British government has not only shaken the entire British public opinion and friends of peace, but also the entire world's peace-loving people.

　　The statement emphasized: But the British government is powerless to obstruct the convening of the Congress and its normal work. The Executive Bureau has accepted the proposal of the Polish Peace Committee to invite all representatives from various countries to hold the Second World Peace Congress in Warsaw from the 16th to the 21st. In this war-torn capital, representatives of people from all over the world will be able to freely exchange views, exchange their proposals, put forward their plans, and reach agreements on the issue of establishing a state of peace.

　　世界和大常设委员会执行局发表声明
    二届和大改在华沙举行
    英政府应负禁止和大在英举行的严重责任
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：世界保卫和平大会常设委员会执行局十二日发表声明称：执行局于十日晚间接获英国和平委员会代表蒙塔古的报告，及随报告附来的英国内政大臣十日下午三时致英国和平委员会的信。执行局从信上获悉：世界和大常设委员会的委员们几乎全被拒绝进入英国。甚至在接到报告之前，执行局即已获悉四百位申请入境签证的代表，已有两百人遭到拒绝。
    预定用作载送大会代表的航空班机，也被英国政府专横地取消。英国政府已对执行局采取了歧视的措施。许多政治、宗教、文化、科学和文学界的领袖如南尼、拉斐德、萧三、法捷耶夫、爱伦堡等均被拒绝入境。
    执行局主席约里奥—居里在抵达英国多维尔时被英国警察逮捕并驱逐出境。执行局坚决抗议此种不可容忍的侮辱行为。
    声明继称：英国政府并不以拒发入境签证给参加大会的个别代表团的重要代表为满足，还企图阻碍全世界人民所表示的愿望的实现。全世界人民都希望美洲与西欧各国人民的代表，能够与苏联和中华人民共和国的代表、与各人民民主国家的代表聚会一堂，共同寻求解决不同制度共存的途径，并同时尊重各族人民的民族独立。为此，执行局不得不声明，英国政府必须在目前严重的国际形势下，负起实际上禁止第二届世界保卫和平大会在英国举行的严重责任。英国政府的这个决定，不仅震动了整个英国舆论界及和平的朋友，也震动了整个世界爱好和平的人们。
    声明强调称：但是英国政府是无力阻碍大会的召开及其正常工作的。执行局已接受了波兰和平委员会的建议，邀请各国的全体代表，于十六日至二十一日在华沙举行第二届世界保卫和平大会。在这个饱经战争苦难的首都里，全世界人民的代表将可能就确立和平状态的问题自由地交换意见，互相交换他们的建议，提出他们的计划并取得协议。
