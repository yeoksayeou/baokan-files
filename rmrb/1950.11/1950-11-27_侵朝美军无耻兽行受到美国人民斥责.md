　　The Shameful and Brutal Acts of the US Invading Army in Korea
    Condemned by the American People
    An American magazine, "Newsweek," published a photograph on October 9th, showing American invading troops humiliating captured Korean female nurses. This photograph once again proves the bestial nature of the American army. The photograph shows four American soldiers shamelessly surrounding two Korean female nurses who have been stripped of their upper garments and are naked. One of the female nurses has also had her shoes and socks removed, leaving her barefoot on the ground. One of the American soldiers is pointing a rifle at their backs.
    After this ugly photograph exposing the shameful and brutal acts of the American invading army was published in "Newsweek," it has aroused protests from American readers. A female nurse, Helen McDonald, wrote in a letter of protest: "This photograph makes me feel very ashamed of the way our army treats prisoners." A university student, Joan Ada Waterson, said in a letter of protest: "Such stripping of clothes completely damages the dignity of women. Even if they are enemies, I think this kind of behavior should be condemned at home." [Xinhua News Agency, 26th] (Attached picture)

　　侵朝美军无耻兽行
    受到美国人民斥责
    美国“新闻周刊”在十月九日刊登了一张美国侵略军凌辱被俘的朝鲜女护士的照片，这张照片又一次证明了美军的兽性。这张照片是：四个美国兵无耻地围站在两个上衣被剥光、赤身裸体的朝鲜女护士的身边。其中一个女护士还被剥去了鞋袜，让她赤脚立在地上。并有一个美国兵端着步枪对准她们的背后。
    当这张暴露美国侵略军的无耻兽行的丑恶照片在“新闻周刊”上刊出之后，已引起了美国读者的抗议。女护士海伦·麦克唐纳在抗议信中写道：“这张照片使我对于我们的军队对待俘虏的方法，感到非常羞耻。”大学生琼·爱达·华特逊在抗议信中说：“这样剥去衣服的情形，完全损害妇女的尊严。即使说她们是敌人，我认为这样做法也应受到国内的斥责。”  【新华社二十六日讯】（附图片）
