Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: The American and Li gangs are again carrying out large-scale arrests and massacres in Seoul, attempting to suppress the resistance of the Korean people. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Seoul on the 17th: The South Korean puppet Minister of Internal Affairs, Zhao Bingyu, admitted at a press conference on the 17th that since November 13th, the puppet police have arrested 55,909 so-called "suspects." Among them, 1,206 have been sent to military tribunals for trial, and 12,377 have been sent to non-military tribunals. Another 612 people have been handed over to the so-called "United Nations" authorities. Zhao Bingyu also said that the "investigation work" on another 25,000 people will be completed before the end of November. This murderer also admitted that his police officers engaged in "inhumane behavior" towards "suspects."
    However, the bloody suppression by the American and Li gangs cannot weaken the fighting spirit of the Korean people. The Korean people have risen up and are actively attacking the enemy everywhere. According to Zhao Bingyu's admission alone, in the month from October 1st to November 5th, the puppet police fought with the people's guerrilla forces 434 times. 168 puppet police officers were killed by the people's guerrilla teams, and more than 590 were wounded.

　　美李匪帮进行血腥镇压
    逮捕五万余朝鲜人民
    各地人民奋起痛击伪警
    【新华社二十一日讯】美、李匪帮又在汉城进行大规模的逮捕和屠杀，妄图借此镇压朝鲜人民的反抗。据美联社汉城十七日讯：南朝鲜伪内务部长赵炳玉十七日在记者招待会上承认：自从十一月十三日以来，伪警察已经逮捕了五万五千九百零九个所谓“嫌疑犯”。其中已有一千二百零六人被解送到军事法庭审讯，有一万二千三百七十七人被解送到非军事法庭。另有六百十二人已交给所谓“联合国”当局。赵炳玉又说：在十一月底以前将完成对另外两万五千余人的“侦察工作”。这个杀人犯同时承认，他手下的警察对于“嫌疑犯”，有着“不人道的行为”。
    但是，美、李匪帮的血腥镇压，是不能削弱朝鲜人民的斗志的。朝鲜人民已经奋起在各地积极打击敌人。仅据赵炳玉所承认的，在十月一日至十一月五日的一个多月内，伪警察就和人民游击部队作战达四百三十四次，伪警察被人民游击队击毙的有一百六十八名，击伤的有五百九十余名。
