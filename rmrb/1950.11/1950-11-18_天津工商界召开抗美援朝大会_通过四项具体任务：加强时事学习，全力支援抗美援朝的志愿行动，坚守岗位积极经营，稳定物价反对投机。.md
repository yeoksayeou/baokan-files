　　Tianjin Business Community Holds Meeting to Resist America and Aid Korea
    Passes Four Specific Tasks: Strengthen Current Affairs Study, Fully Support the Volunteer Action to Resist America and Aid Korea, Stand Firm at Posts and Actively Manage Businesses, Stabilize Prices and Oppose Speculation.
    [This Newspaper] According to the Tianjin Daily: The Tianjin business community held a conference on November 14th to resist America, aid Korea, protect homes, and defend the country. In addition to relaying Mayor Huang Jing's report on the current situation, the meeting also adopted four specific tasks for the city's business community in the current movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect homes, and defend the country: (1) Contribute all efforts to support the volunteer action to resist America and aid Korea. (2) Stand firm at work posts, ensure active management, and improve production. (3) Resolutely support government policies and decrees, ensure price stability, and oppose hoarding, speculation, and profiteering. (4) Strengthen the study of current affairs, recognize the current situation, expand propaganda, unify thinking, recognize friends and enemies, and not listen to reactionary elements spreading rumors.
    More than 100 people attended the meeting, including standing committee members of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, heads of various industry and commerce guilds in the city, and representatives. In their speeches, everyone unanimously expressed their firm determination to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend the country, and resolved to assist the government in stabilizing finance and prices. Li Zhuchen, Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, conveyed Mayor Huang Jing's report on the current situation, explaining that if Korea is occupied by American imperialism, it will be impossible for us to carry out peaceful construction; only by resisting America and aiding Korea can we defend China and world peace. He pointed out: If our industrial and commercial circles do not have patriotism, they will not be national industrialists and businessmen. He called on the Tianjin industrial and commercial circles to stand at their posts, work hard to manage their businesses, improve production, and take practical actions to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend the country. Zhu Jisheng, Vice Chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, said when conveying the report of Sun Qimeng, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council: Industrialists and businessmen must thoroughly recognize the aggressive nature of American imperialism; we cannot ignore, cannot slightly ignore, and cannot slowly deal with the American invasion of Korea, and at the same time, we have the strength to deal with it. Bi Mingqi, Vice Chairman of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, conveyed the speech of Li Gengtao, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Municipal Finance Committee, at the sixth plenary meeting. He said: After listening to Director Li's instructions, I felt that our industrialists and businessmen should resolutely support all government measures to stabilize prices. The industry and commerce of our Tianjin city have developed under the correct leadership of the People's Government. Past experience has proved that all industries and businesses that have strived to operate in accordance with the policies of the People's Government have been assisted and developed by the People's Government. He said: At present, there are still a few speculators who are engaged in hoarding, speculation, and profiteering. This behavior violates the interests of the people and is not allowed by the broad masses of the people. He called on the participants to unite and educate these speculators, and if necessary, severely crack down on them to maintain the honor of Tianjin's industrial and commercial circles. Sun Mingyuan, Chairman of the Hotel Industry Association, Dong Shaochen, Chairman of the Hardware Industry Association, Wang Yuanbo, Chairman of the North-South Native Products Industry Association, and representatives from the match industry, import and export industry, vegetable oil industry, oil business, printing industry, pharmaceutical industry, and beef and mutton industry all stated in their speeches that they are willing to stand firm at their work posts, operate with peace of mind, improve production, and take practical actions to resist America, aid Korea, protect their homes, and defend the country. The conference finally unanimously adopted a resolution on the four specific tasks for the city's industrial and commercial circles in the current movement to resist America and aid Korea.
    [Also Reported] As of the 14th, 58 branches of the "Defend World Peace, Oppose American Aggression" association have been established in various industries and businesses in Tianjin, and have begun to carry out propaganda work.
