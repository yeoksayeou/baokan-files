[Report from this newspaper] The American imperialists' acts of aggression have enraged the broad masses of Chinese peasants. Peasants in the northeastern provinces, as well as North China, Northern Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Xinjiang, and the outskirts of Beijing, are enthusiastically paying public grain to strengthen the country's power, support the Korean people, and resist American imperialist aggression.

	Delivering the Best Grain to Strengthen National Power

Having suffered from American air raids, peasants in Liaodong Province put forward the slogan "Prepare the best grain and dedicate it to the country to defend the motherland." In Da Weng Village, Zhaodong, under the leadership of the Guan Qigang mutual aid team, the peasants proposed that millet and corn should be uniformly whole grains, sorghum should not have soil attached, and soybeans should be 100% good grains. Everyone uses this as a condition for mutual challenge and competition. In the past, farmers in Liaodong Province mostly threshed on frozen ground. This year, in order to pay public grain early and well, many farmers have switched to threshing on warmer ground. In some areas of western Liaoning Province that were affected by frost, farmers chose to single-harvest the larger and fuller ears of grain. In some areas where soybeans were attacked by insects, women and children selected the grains after threshing. Some farmers in Songjiang Province even put the good grains selected during threshing through the winnowing fan again. Some farmers whose own grain was not good exchanged it with others to pay public grain. Ju Hongdian, a farmer in the suburbs of Andong City, said while preparing public grain: "If the American devils dare to invade our new China, I will definitely put down my red tassel spear and pick up a steel gun to fight them!" Farmers in Huanghuashu Village, Kaidao County, Heilongjiang Province, selected 10,700 catties of good grain in four days, which promoted a selection frenzy in the entire region. Rural people's representatives, representing 500,000 farmers in the suburbs of Shenyang City, unanimously proposed at a current affairs forum on November 3: In order to resist US aggression and aid Korea and defend the motherland, we will do whatever is needed of us; we must deliver good public grain; and we must also do a good job in production and consolidate security. In the process of paying grain, Party members, Youth League members, model workers, village cadres, and active farmers have all played a leading role.

With the glorious tradition of supporting the revolutionary war for many years, North China's farmers enthusiastically pay public grain, expressing their determination to resist US aggression and aid Korea, protect their homes and defend the country. In the first district of Yanggao County, Chahar Province, all public grain was paid off in two days. The farmers of Dongyuan Village in the district transported more than 10,000 catties of public grain to the outside of the granary overnight before the start of the levy; the grain was full, and it won the first place as an autumn levy model. Liu Yun, a model worker representative from Zhuolu County who attended the National Congress of Labor Models, convened a meeting of more than 100 representatives from 39 neighboring villages and decided to complete the originally scheduled ten-day autumn levy task three days earlier.

	Model Workers Take the Lead to Guarantee and Strive to Be Grain Delivery Models

At the model worker conference in Boye County, Hebei Province, in addition to discussing how to promote autumn levy and autumn plowing, the situation of US imperialist aggression against Korea was also discussed. The model workers unanimously believed that our good days did not come easily, and we resolutely do not allow US imperialism to make trouble. The model workers all said: We must strive to be a model of grain delivery, a model of autumn plowing, and a model of manure accumulation when we go back, and finally we must strive to be a model of supporting the front, and we must also motivate others. Model workers and district and village cadres in Wanxian, Baxian, Anping and other counties also expressed their determination to lead the masses to quickly pay public grain, support the Korean people, and strike at US imperialism.

More than 500 farmers in Guantian Township, Shuyang County, Northern Jiangsu, collectively swore at a conference that they would use the practical actions of paying good public grain to oppose US imperialist aggression. There was a large meeting in the morning, and 95 farmers changed to good grain in the afternoon. Because the new Yi River benefited from the water flow, the late autumn harvest was abundant in Shucheng, Liuji, Yanzhi and other districts along the Xinyi River line, and the enthusiasm of the masses to pay grain was particularly high. The Shucheng branch granary received more than 200,000 catties of grain in one day. Some townships paid off all their debts on the first day. Women played a big role in the grain delivery. The Southern Jiangsu Farmers' Association, which has 3 million members, recently issued a statement calling on farmers throughout the region to step up the elimination of bandits and special agents, implement land reform, and strive to restore and develop agricultural production to consolidate rural order and increase national strength. Farmers in many townships automatically convened current affairs forums.

	Organize the Masses to Protect the Warehouse and Strictly Prevent Bad People from Making Trouble

A grain delivery boom has been set off in the suburbs of Beijing. In the course of the work, village cadres and activists conducted individual talks with rural reactionary landlords and bad elements to prevent sabotage by counter-revolutionary elements. When public grain was stored in Jiangxi Province, 2,000 catties of public grain were stolen from the Zhangkou warehouse in Xiajiang County. Other counties in the province also had incidents of sabotage of varying degrees. The province has now begun to organize the masses to protect the warehouse and strictly prevent all kinds of sabotage.

	Farmers of All Ethnic Groups in Xinjiang Pay Patriotic Public Grain

Farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are carrying forward the spirit of patriotism and enthusiastically paying autumn agricultural tax. Public grain in Dihua, Qiande and other counties has begun to be put into storage. Dihua County began to levy taxes in early October. Due to the reduced and reasonable burden compared with before liberation, and the patriotic enthusiasm of farmers of all ethnic groups, the levy was completed by October 22. On the 22nd, the farmers of the whole township fed their horses and set up carts to send grain collectively. More than 30 large carts, loaded with the public grain paid by the whole township, entered the city in formation, with portraits of Chairman Mao and the national flag held high in front of the team. After a long journey of more than 40 miles, when the grain transport train entered Dihua City that afternoon, the Yangko drums were very lively. The audience believed that it was an unprecedented event in the history of Xinjiang. Now, the grain levy work in Dihua and nearby counties has been launched one after another, and Nanzhao will also begin soon.

	People's Congresses at All Levels in Various Regions Guarantee to Do a Good Job in Autumn Levy

People's congresses at all levels are being held in Lishui and Lanxi in Zhejiang, Yucheng in Henan, and Dushan in Guizhou. After hearing the news of the expansion of the war of aggression by the United States, the representatives were filled with indignation and wrote letters to Chairman Mao in the name of the conference, or sent telegrams, expressing their determination to resist US aggression and aid Korea, protect their homes and defend the country. And specifically put forward: guarantee to do a good job in autumn levy work, production work, and strive to defeat US imperialist aggression to the end.

　　决心抗美援朝保家卫国  各地农民踊跃缴纳公粮
    【本报讯】美帝的侵略暴行激怒了中国广大农民，东北各省及华北、苏北、江西、新疆、北京郊区等地农民踊跃缴纳公粮，以充实国家力量，支援朝鲜人民，抗击美帝侵略。
            交顶好的粮食  充实国家力量
    曾遭受美机扫射、轰炸的辽东省农民，提出“准备最好的粮食，献给国家，保卫祖国”的口号。肇东大瓮村在关启刚互助组带头下，农民提出：谷子、苞米要粒粒整齐，高粱不容附有泥土，大豆要百分之百的好粒。大家并以此作为互相挑战竞赛的条件。辽东省农民过去大多是打冻场，今年为了早缴和缴好公粮，很多农民都改打暖场。辽西省北部部分地区曾受到霜灾，农民就选择穗大粒饱的单打。有的地区大豆遭虫咬，妇女儿童在打场后进行粒选。松江省有些农民还把打场中选出的好粮再过一次扇车。有的农民因自己的粮食不好，就向别人调换好的缴公粮。安东市郊农民鞠洪殿一边准备公粮一边说：“美国鬼子如敢来犯咱新中国，我一定放下红缨枪拿起钢枪和它拼！”黑龙江省开道县黄花树屯农民在四天内选好了一万零七百斤好粮，推动了全区的选粮热潮。代表沈阳市郊五十万农民的农村人民代表，在十一月三日的时事座谈会上，一致提出：为了抗美援朝，保卫祖国，需要我们做甚么就做甚么；送公粮要送好的；更要搞好生产，巩固治安。各地在缴粮中，党员、团员、劳动模范、村干部和农民积极分子，都起了带头作用。
    华北农民以多年来支援革命战争的光荣传统，踊跃缴纳公粮，表示抗美援朝保家卫国的决心。察哈尔省阳高县第一区，在两天内就全部交清了公粮。该区东园村在开征前一天，农民连夜将一万多斤公粮运到粮库门外等候；粮食颗颗饱满，荣获秋征模范第一名。涿鹿县出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议的劳模代表刘云曾召集了邻近三十九个村的一百余名代表开会，决定把原定十天完成的秋征任务，提前三天完成。
            劳模带头保证  争作交粮模范
    河北省博野县劳模大会上，除商量了如何推进秋征、秋耕工作外，并讨论了美帝侵略朝鲜的局势。劳模们一致认为：咱们的好日子可不是容易来的，坚决不许美帝来捣乱，劳模们都表示：回去一定要争取作一个交粮模范，秋耕模范，积肥模范，最后更要争取作支前模范，还要带动别人。完县、霸县、安平等县的劳模及区、村干部也都表示了带动群众快缴公粮，支援朝鲜人民，打击美帝的决心。
    苏北沭阳县官田乡五百余农民曾在大会上集体宣誓，要用缴好公粮的实际行动来反对美帝侵略。上午开大会，下午就有九十五家农民换了好粮。新沂河线的沭城、刘集、颜集等区因新沂河走水受益，晚秋丰收，群众缴粮情绪特别高涨。沭城支库一天即收粮二十余万斤。有的乡在第一天就全部缴清。送粮中，妇女们起了很大作用。拥有三百万会员的苏南区农民协会最近发表声明，号召全区农民加紧肃清匪特，实行土地改革，并努力恢复和发展农业生产，来巩固农村秩序，增加国家力量。许多乡的农民们自动召开了时事座谈会。
            组织群众护仓  严防坏人捣乱
    北京郊区已掀起了缴粮热潮。在工作进行中，村干部、积极分子为防止反革命分子的破坏活动，对农村的反动地主和坏分子进行了个别谈话。江西省在公粮入库时，峡江县章口仓库曾被窃去公粮两千余斤。该省其他各县亦有轻重不等的破坏事件发生。现该省已开始组织群众护仓，严防各种破坏。
            新疆各族农民  交纳爱国公粮
    新疆各族农民发扬爱国主义精神，踊跃缴纳秋季农业税。迪化、乾德等县的公粮已开始入仓。迪化县于十月上旬开征，由于负担比解放以前减轻而且合理，加以各族农民的爱国主义热情，到十月二十二日就已征齐。二十二日，全乡农民喂马套车，集体送粮。三十多辆大车，装载着全乡缴纳的公粮整队入城，队前高举着毛主席画像和国旗。经四十多里的长途跋涉，运粮列车于当天下午进入迪化市时，秧歌锣鼓，热闹非常，观众都认为是新疆有史以来的创举。现在，迪化和附近各县征粮工作已陆续展开，南疆各地也将开始。
            各地各界人代会议  保证作好秋征工作
    浙江丽水、兰溪，河南虞城及贵州独山等县正召开各界人民代表会议。听到美帝扩大侵略战争的消息后，代表们莫不义愤填膺，均以大会名义给毛主席写信，或发出通电，表明抗美援朝保家卫国决心。并具体提出：保证作好秋征工作、生产工作，为打败美帝侵略而奋斗到底。
