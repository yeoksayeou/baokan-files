Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 4th: According to a Tokyo dispatch from the Denstu News Agency on the 1st, Japan held "Peace Signature Day" on October 14th and 15th. The large number of peace signatures collected during these two days will be carried to Tokyo simultaneously on November 5th by two bicycle teams starting from Kagoshima in the south and Sapporo in the north, in a relay race.

During the two days of "Peace Signature Day," peace movement activists across Japan actively mobilized, responding to the call of the Japanese Peace Protection Committee. According to United Press, activists from various branches of the National Federation of Agricultural and Forestry Ministry Employees mobilized on the streets, in factories, and in residential areas to collect peace signatures. Statistics from only a portion of the council, the Nishihara (place name) and Meguro (place name) branches of the Agricultural Research Institute, and the Fisheries Research Institute branch show that they collected approximately 1,400 signatures. In Amagasaki, near Osaka, six members of the Women's Democratic Club collected signatures from more than 500 people in two days.
