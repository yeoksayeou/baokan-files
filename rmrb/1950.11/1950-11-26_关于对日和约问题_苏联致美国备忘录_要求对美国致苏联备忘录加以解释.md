Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 25th: TASS Moscow, November 24th dispatch: On October 26th of this year, John Foster Dulles, Consultant to the U.S. State Department, delivered to Soviet Representative to the Security Council Malik in New York a memorandum from the U.S. Government regarding the Japanese Peace Treaty, which read as follows:

    The following is a brief general statement of the kind of treaty which the United States Government believes would be suitable to end the state of war with Japan. It is emphasized that this statement is not a final draft, but a tentative one, and the United States is not thereby bound to the detailed content and wording of any future draft. It is anticipated that there will be an opportunity to study this draft in the future, at which time a series of negotiations will be held, the purpose of which will be to further refine the draft and to clarify any points that initially appear ambiguous.

    The United States suggests that such a treaty to end the state of war with Japan would restore Japan's sovereignty and return Japan to the society of free peoples as an equal member. On specific issues, the treaty would reflect the following principles:

    (1)  Contracting States: Any or all states at war with Japan willing to make peace on the basis of the proposed and possibly agreed upon terms.

    (2)  United Nations: Membership for Japan in the United Nations will be considered.

    (3)  Territory: Japan (a) will recognize the independence of Korea; (b) will agree to place the Ryukyu and Ogasawara Islands under United Nations trusteeship, with the United States as the administering authority; and (c) will accept the future decisions of the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, China, and the United States regarding the status of Taiwan, the Pescadores Islands, South Sakhalin, and the Kurile Islands. If a decision cannot be reached within one year after the treaty comes into force, the United Nations General Assembly shall decide. Special rights in China will be abolished.

    (4)  Security: The treaty should provide that, pending the adoption of other satisfactory security measures, such as effective responsibility by the United Nations, there is a continued responsibility for cooperation between Japanese facilities and the armed forces of the United States or other countries to maintain international peace and security in the Japan area.

    (5)  Political and Commercial Measures: Japan will agree to comply with multilateral treaties on narcotics and fisheries. Pre-war bilateral treaties may be amended by mutual agreement. Pending the conclusion of new commercial treaties, Japan shall accord other countries most-favored-nation treatment, subject to normal exceptions.

    (6)  Claims: The contracting parties waive all claims arising from acts of war prior to September 2, 1945, except in the following cases: (a) In general, the Allied powers will retain Japanese property within their territories; (b) Japan will return Allied property, and if it cannot be fully returned, it may be compensated in yen at a percentage of the lost value agreed upon by both parties.

    (7)  Disputes: Disputes over claims will be resolved by a special arbitration tribunal established by the President of the International Court of Justice. Other disputes will be resolved by diplomatic means or submitted to the International Court of Justice.

On November 20th, Malik, on the instruction of the Soviet Government, delivered a memorandum to Mr. Dulles, which read as follows:

    "Memorandum

    On October 26th of this year, during a meeting with Malik, Mr. Dulles delivered a memorandum regarding the Japanese Peace Treaty, which briefly and generally stated the U.S. Government's opinion on what kind of treaty would be suitable to end the state of war with Japan. In this regard, the Soviet Government wishes to have certain points in the memorandum explained.

    (1) As is well known, the United States, the United Kingdom, China, the Soviet Union, and many other countries that signed the United Nations Declaration in Washington on January 1, 1942, pledged not to make a separate peace with enemy states.

    In view of the existence of the above guarantee, it is hoped that the following questions will be explained, namely: Is it intended to conclude a Japanese peace treaty that must be participated in by the United States, Britain, China, the Soviet Union, and any country that actively participated in the war against Japan and signed the instrument of surrender, or is the possibility of signing a separate Japanese peace treaty participated in only by some of the above countries permissible?

    (2) The Cairo Declaration signed by the United States, Britain, and China on December 1, 1943, and the Potsdam Proclamation signed by them on July 26, 1945 (which was also signed by the Soviet Union) have decided the issue of returning Taiwan and the Pescadores Islands to China. The Yalta Agreement signed by the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union on February 11, 1945, also similarly decided the issue of returning South Sakhalin and adjacent islands to the Soviet Union and transferring the Kurile Islands to the Soviet Union.

    Given the existence of the above agreements, how should the proposal in the memorandum to submit the issue of the status of Taiwan, the Pescadores Islands, South Sakhalin, and the Kurile Islands to a new decision by the United States, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union, and if the above countries cannot reach a decision within one year, to submit it to the United Nations General Assembly for decision, be understood?

    (3) Neither the Cairo Declaration nor the Potsdam Proclamation stated that the Ryukyu Islands and the Ogasawara Islands must be separated from Japanese sovereignty, and the signatory countries of this declaration declared that they "have no intention of territorial expansion."

    In this case, the question arises - on what basis is the proposal in the memorandum to transfer the Ryukyu Islands and the Ogasawara Islands to United Nations trusteeship with the United States as the administering authority based?

    (4) As is well known, the Japanese people are very concerned about whether the occupying forces will remain in Japan after the conclusion of the peace treaty, especially since the Potsdam Proclamation (Article 12) has already stipulated that the occupying forces should be withdrawn from Japan.

    In this regard, the Soviet Government would like to know whether it is considered that the Japanese peace treaty must have a definite date for the withdrawal of the occupying forces from the territory of that country, as is the case with peace treaties concluded with some other countries.

    (5) The decision agreed upon by the member states of the Far Eastern Commission on June 19, 1947, and adopted on the proposal of the United States, stipulates that Japan shall not maintain land, sea, or air forces. However, the memorandum explaining the U.S. attitude on the issue of security in the Japan area mentions that there is a continued responsibility for cooperation between Japanese facilities and the armed forces of the United States or other countries to maintain international peace and security in the Japan area.

    Since the memorandum mentions the above-mentioned responsibility for cooperation to maintain international peace and security in the Japan area, the Soviet Government would like to receive explanations on the following two questions:

    First, does the above-mentioned responsibility for cooperation presuppose the establishment of Japanese armed forces, namely, the establishment of the Japanese army, navy, air force, and the respective headquarters of the Japanese forces?

    Second, does the above-mentioned responsibility for cooperation mean that the military, naval, and air force bases of the United States in Japan will continue to be maintained after the conclusion of the Japanese peace treaty?

    (6) The memorandum does not mention the necessity of guaranteeing the Japanese people the possibility of freely developing their peaceful economy.

    The Soviet Government hopes to receive an explanation as to whether it is intended to include in the peace treaty provisions stipulating the abolition of restrictions on the development of Japan's peaceful economy, allowing Japan to obtain raw materials, and allowing Japan to participate in world trade on an equal footing.

    China is particularly concerned about the issue of the Japanese peace treaty, which is very obvious, because it was China that suffered years of aggression from Japanese militarists. The Soviet Government would like to know: What measures are you taking to ascertain the views of the Government of the People's Republic of China on this issue?

    Needless to say, these questions, or other questions that may arise after the attitude of other governments towards the U.S. memorandum becomes clear, must be explained."

Mr. Dulles stated that he would respond in writing to the questions mentioned in the memorandum.

　　关于对日和约问题
    苏联致美国备忘录
    要求对美国致苏联备忘录加以解释
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十四日讯：今年十月二十六日，美国国务院顾问杜勒斯，在纽约以美国政府关于对日和约的备忘录一件递交苏联驻安理会代表马立克，其内容如下：
    兹就美国政府认为何种条约适合于结束对日战争状态，作简短的一般的声明如下：现特着重说明：这个声明不是最后定稿，而是暂定的，美国不因而对未来任何草案的详细内容与措词受到约束。预期将来会有机会研究这个草案，届时将会举行一系列的谈判，其目的在于进一步拟定草案，并澄清一切最初看来不明确的各点。
    美国建议，这种将结束作战状态的对日条约，将恢复日本的主权，并使日本回到自由人民的社会中成为平等的一员。就具体问题而论，条约将反映下列原则：
    （一）缔约国家：任何或一切愿意在所建议的和可能获得协议的基础上媾和的对日作战国家。
    （二）联合国：对日本的会籍将予以考虑。
    （三）领土：日本（甲）将承认朝鲜的独立；（乙）同意由联合国托管琉球和小笠原群岛，而以美国为管理当局；（丙）接受大不列颠联合王国、苏联、中国及美国将来所作关于台湾、澎湖列岛、南库页岛与千岛群岛的地位的决定。如果在条约生效后一年以内不能获得决定时，则由联合国大会决定之。在中国的特殊权益将予废除。
    （四）安全：条约应规定，在未采取另外的、诸如由联合国担负有效责任等满意的安全措施之前，日本的设备与美国的或其他军队之间有继续合作以维持日本地区的国际和平与安全的责任。
    （五）政治与商业措施：日本将同意遵守关于麻醉剂与渔业的多边条约。战前双边条约可经由相互的协议加以修改，在没有缔结新的商约之前，日本应予他国以最惠国待遇，但得有正常的例外。
    （六）权利要求：缔约各方放弃在一九四五年九月二日以前因战争行为而产生的权利要求，但下述情形例外：（甲）一般说来，盟国将占有在它们领土内的日本财产；（乙）日本将归还盟国财产，如不能完整归还，可按双方协议的关于损失价值的百分率以日元赔偿之。
    （七）争端：权利要求的争端将由特别中立法庭解决之，该法庭由国际法院院长设立之。其他争端由外交解决或提交国际法院解决之。
    十一月二十日，马立克奉苏联政府训令将备忘录一份递交杜勒斯先生，其内容如下：
    “备忘录
    本年十月二十六日，杜勒斯先生在与马立克会谈过程中，曾将关于对日和约问题的备忘录一份交与马立克，其中简短而一般地说明美国政府关于结束对日战争状态究应采取何种条约为适宜的意见。在这一方面，该备忘录中有若干点，苏联政府愿意得到解释。
    （一）如所周知，美国、英国、中国、苏联以及其他许多在一九四二年一月一日在华盛顿签署联合国宣言的国家，曾保证不与敌国单独媾和。
    鉴于上述保证的存在，希望对下列问题加以解释，即：是否有意于缔结一个必须由在日本投降书上签字的美、英、中、苏以及曾积极参加对日作战的任何国家参加的对日和约，或者是否容许有签订仅由上述国家中某些国家参加的单独对日和约的可能性。
    （二）美、英、中在一九四三年十二月一日签字的开罗宣言，以及它们一九四五年七月二十六日签字的波茨坦公告（这个公告并得到苏联的签署）业已决定了把台湾和澎湖列岛交还中国的问题，美、英、苏在一九四五年二月十一日签订的雅尔塔协定，也同样地决定了把库页岛南部和邻近岛屿交还苏联以及把千岛群岛移交苏联的问题。
    既然已有上述协议存在，备忘录中主张把台湾、澎湖列岛、南库页岛和千岛群岛的地位问题提交美、英、中、苏重新决定，如果上述各国在一年以内不能获得决定时，就提交联合国大会决定的建议，应如何理解？
    （三）开罗宣言和波茨坦公告都没有说琉球群岛和小笠原群岛必须脱离日本主权，而这个宣言的签字国又曾宣布：它们“无扩张领土之意”。
    这样一来，问题就发生了——备忘录中把琉球群岛和小笠原群岛移交联合国托管而以美国为管理当局的建议，其根据何在？
    （四）如所周知，日本人民所非常关心的是：在缔结和约以后占领军是否还将留在日本，特别是由于波茨坦公告（第十二条）业已规定占领军应自日本撤出。
    在这一方面，苏联政府愿意知道，是否认为对日和约必须有如与一些其他国家缔结的和约，规定将占领军撤出该国领土的确定的日期。
    （五）一九四七年六月十九日远东委员会各会员国所同意的，在美国提议下通过的决定，规定日本不得保有陆、海、空军。然而，说明美国对日本地区安全问题的态度的该项备忘录，却谈到日本的设备与美国的或其他军队之间有继续合作以维持日本地区的国际和平与安全的责任。
    既然该备忘录谈到了上述进行合作以维持日本地区国际和平与安全的责任，那么，苏联政府便愿意得到关于下列两个问题的解释：
    第一，上述合作的责任是否预定要建立日本武装部队，即建立日本陆军、海军、空军、以及日本的各该参谋总部。
    第二，上述合作的责任是否意味着美国在日本的军事、海军和空军基地在对日和约缔结之后仍然继续保持下去。
    （六）备忘录关于保证日本人民有可能自由发展其和平经济的必要性，只字未提。
    苏联政府希望得到解释，是否有意于将规定取消对日本和平经济的发展的限制，允许日本取得原料，并允许日本以平等权利参加世界贸易的条款列入和约中。
    中国特别关切对日和约问题，这是非常明显的。因为正是中国曾受日本军国主义者多年的侵略。苏联政府愿意知道：贵国正在作何措施以确定知道中华人民共和国政府对这个问题的意见。
    无须说，对于这些问题，或者当他国政府对美国备忘录的态度表明之后可能发生的其他问题，均须加以解释。”
    杜勒斯先生声称，对于备忘录内所提到的问题，将以书面答复。
