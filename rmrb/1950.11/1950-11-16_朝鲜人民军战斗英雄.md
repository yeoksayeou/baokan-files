　　Zhao Zhongda, Who Eliminated 85 Enemies

　　Combat hero Squad Leader Zhao Zhongda ambushed an enemy mobile unit. To annihilate the enemy tanks and trucks that were routed towards Daegu after suffering a disastrous defeat in the Gimcheon area, Zhao Zhongda's squad pursued the enemy like thunder and cut off their retreat.

　　Zhao Zhongda's squad prepared to ambush the enemy, lying in ambush on both sides of the road. At this time, the enemy's heavy tanks, one after another, and trucks loaded with anti-aircraft guns, 60mm cannons, and various other artillery pieces, were frantically rushing forward.

　　The enemy's firepower and strength seemed impressive, but the incomparably brave Comrade Zhao Zhongda, with the aim of capturing the enemy alive and seizing their weapons, deliberately waited for the enemy to approach.

　　When the enemy approached within grenade-throwing distance, Comrade Zhao Zhongda quickly threw anti-tank grenades one after another. The enemy, relying on superior forces, initially attempted to counterattack, but the soldiers of Zhao Zhongda's squad continued to throw grenades, blowing up enemy trucks and tanks. The disorganized enemy began to jump around and flee.

　　That day, Comrade Zhao Zhongda single-handedly killed 85 enemies and captured one tank, six trucks, five heavy cannons, anti-aircraft guns, and 60mm cannons, as well as many other weapons and ammunition.

　　Kim Bok-cheol, the God-like Gunner Who Never Misses

　　The artillerymen of the Korean People's Army, mastering advanced military technology, have demonstrated unparalleled power in the Fatherland Liberation War to repel the American imperialist aggressors, inflicting annihilating blows on the enemy.

　　During the battle in the ×× area, one gun of the ×× self-propelled artillery detachment, after eliminating enemy firepower during the battle in the ×× mountain pass, continued to advance.

　　The gunner of this gun was Comrade Kim Bok-cheol, who, whenever he discovered enemy firepower, had the confidence to sweep away the enemy with unfailing accuracy.

　　As Comrade Kim Bok-cheol was reaching the road in front of ×× Mountain, the panicked enemy, due to the fierce attacks of the People's Army, concentrated all their firepower on him. However, the incomparably brave gunner Kim Bok-cheol did not panic at all. With accurate aiming, he searched for the enemy's machine gun firing points from right to left, and then eliminated them one by one in order.

　　He fired five shells and completely blew up one permanent firing point and three earthen and wooden firing points.

　　This astonishing achievement continued to be maintained in the intense battle.

　　He fired 103 shells and hit 98 of them. This superior shooting made the enemy tremble.

　　The powerful shooting of gunner Kim Bok-cheol encouraged and motivated the People's Army. The infantry of the ×× detachment shouted, "Long live our artillery!" and in one fell swoop occupied ×× Mountain, pursuing and sweeping away the routed enemy troops.

　　Park Dae-hee's Squad Defends the High Ground

　　The Third Squad of Li Deqing's Company received an order from the command post to defend a certain place 50 li behind the Ankang front line. The command post ordered that they were not allowed to retreat without further orders.

　　After receiving the order, all the combatants of the Third Squad immediately constructed a tenacious defensive position. Because there were few trees and rocks on the high ground, it was difficult to construct a defensive position, but thanks to the all-night efforts of all the commanders and fighters, it was finally built.

　　Just as they had finished building the defensive line and trenches, a messenger came from the outpost and reported to the squad leader: "More than 150 enemies have been discovered 400 meters in front of the high ground, and they are attacking the high ground." The combatants, who were tired from constructing the defensive position, prepared for battle without rest.

　　The enemy troops put heavy machine guns in front and began to cross the river next to the high ground. Just at this moment, the squad leader fired a flare gun signaling everyone to open fire, and submachine gun and rifle bullets poured down on the enemy. The enemy troops in the river were caught in a sudden barrage of fire, panicked, and began to flee. The bodies of enemy soldiers killed by the People's Army fell into the river, staining the river water red.

　　The squad combatants estimated that the defeated enemy would counterattack, so they sheltered themselves in the trenches and waited for the enemy's counterattack.

　　The sun had already risen, and just as originally estimated, more than 1,000 enemies, concentrating heavy and light machine gun fire on the high ground, crossed the river and climbed up the high ground.

　　It was easy to see the climbing enemies on the bald mountain. In order to conserve ammunition, the People's Army threw stones down the mountain, and many of the enemy's heavy and light machine guns at the front were damaged by the stones. The enemies hit by the stones fell to the ground before they could scream, but the enemies stubbornly continued to climb. A portion of the enemy had already climbed to the top, but they were attacked by the People's Army's grenades and retreated.

　　Such charges and counter-charges were repeated several times, and finally the enemy launched an all-out attack on the high ground with all their forces. In this intense battle, two squad leaders of the People's Army had already been sacrificed, but someone immediately took their place. After nearly four hours of intense fighting, the enemy began to panic, abandoning more than a hundred corpses and fleeing in terror.

　　At this time, the command post had not yet given instructions. At about 2:00 a.m., the enemy surrounded the high ground with a large battalion of troops. The remaining 30-odd People's Army combatants were all resolved to fight to the death.

　　The enemy was about to reach the high ground. The completely surrounded People's Army combatants all picked up grenades, waiting only for Comrade Park Dae-hee's order. Comrade Park Dae-hee took out his Party membership card from his small bag, thinking:

　　"This is my Party membership card. I was nurtured by the Party. Even if my body is sacrificed here, I cannot let the enemy take my Party membership card."

　　He put the Party membership card in his mouth, preparing to swallow it at the last moment.

　　Time passed heavily, minute after minute!

　　The combat mission was conveyed from this trench to that trench. Every soldier's heart was defending every inch of the motherland's land with life, blood, and flesh.

　　Start firing!

　　Acting Squad Leader Comrade Park Dae-hee fired the flare to begin the attack.

　　The sound of submachine guns rang out everywhere, raining down on the enemy. The gun barrels burned red. The enemy, under heavy fire, began to panic. The People's Army combatants rushed into the panicked enemy, launching a brave bayonet charge.

　　When the bullets ran out, only grenades were left. The soldiers, holding grenades, jumped into the densely packed enemy ranks.

　　Grenades, human bombs...

　　This spirit of selfless sacrifice can only be achieved by those who fight for the freedom and happiness of the motherland, the leader, and the people.

　　In nearly two hours of bayonet fighting, the enemy, leaving countless corpses, retreated to the foot of the mountain.

　　In this way, all the combatants of the Third Squad of the ×× Detachment defended the ×× high ground until the command post gave the order.

    毙敌八十五人的赵钟大
    战斗英雄赵钟大班长，奇袭了敌人机动部队。为了歼灭在金山一带遭到惨败向大邱溃走的敌军坦克和卡车，这时候赵钟大的班像奔雷似的追击着敌人，并切断了敌人的退路。
    赵钟大班准备着奇袭敌人，埋伏在道路左右边。这时敌人笨重的坦克在前面一辆接连着一辆，卡车满载着高射炮，六○厘米炮等各种炮，疯狂地往前跑来。
    敌人的火力和兵力显得很威风，可是勇敢无比的赵钟大同志，为了活捉敌人缴获武器的目的，有意地等候着敌人接近。
    敌人接近到投弹能达到的距离时，赵钟大同志即很快地接连将反坦克手榴弹投过去。依靠优势兵力的敌人一时尚试图反击，但赵钟大班的战士们继续不断的投手榴弹，爆破了敌人卡车和坦克，乌合之众的敌人，开始乱跳起来逃跑了。
    这天赵钟大同志一个人杀死了敌人八十五名，缴获了坦克一辆，卡车六辆，重炮，高射炮，六○厘米炮等五门，以及其他很多武器和弹药。
    弹不虚发的神炮手金福喆
    朝鲜人民军的炮兵们，掌握着先进的军事技术，为打退美帝侵略者，在祖国解放战争中，发挥了无比的威力，给予敌人以歼灭性的打击。
    在××地方战斗中，××自动炮区分队的一门炮，经过××山沟的战斗，消灭了敌人的火力之后，继续前进着。
    这门炮的炮手就是金福喆同志，他每当发现敌人火力的时候，就有百发百中扫荡敌人的信心。
    金福喆同志正在到达××山前面道路的时候，由于人民军部队猛烈的攻击，仓惶的敌人便将全部火力集中向他射出炮弹，可是勇敢无比的炮手金福吉同志一点也不慌张地以正确的瞄准，从右侧到左侧寻找敌人的机枪火力点，接着便按次序地一个一个的消灭他们。
    他射出五发炮弹把一个永久火力点和三个土木火力点完全爆破。
    这种惊人的成果，在炽烈的战斗中，继续保持着。
    他射出一百○三发炮弹，命中了九十八发。这种优越的射击使得敌人战栗。
    炮手金福喆同志的有威力的射击，鼓舞推动了人民军。××区分队的步兵们高喊着：“我们的炮兵万岁！”同时一气即占领了××山，追击并扫荡了溃走的敌军。
    坚守高地的朴大熙小队
    李德庆中队第三小队，由指挥处接到了坚守安康后方五十里某地的命令，指挥处的命令说，没有另外的命令不准撤退。
    第三小队全体战斗员接到命令后立即构筑了顽强的防御阵地。因为高地上的树木和岩石较少，所以难于构筑防御阵地，但由于全体指战员通宵的努力，终于筑成了。
    刚做好防御线和战壕时，由步哨处派来了传令兵，他向小队长报告说：“高地前面四百米处发现敌人一百五十余名，他们正向高地进攻。”由于构筑防御阵地而疲倦的战斗员们，不休息的准备了战斗。
    敌军们把重机放在前面开始去渡高地旁边的那条河，正当这个时候，小队长发出了一齐开枪的信号弹，冲锋枪和步枪子弹向敌军集中打出去了。河里的敌军遭到突然的射击，惊慌失措，开始逃走。人民军打死的敌军尸体倒在河里，染红了河水。
    小队战斗员们估计到被击溃的敌人一定会反攻，便在战壕里掩蔽着身体，等待着敌人的反攻。
    太阳已经上来了，正像原来估计一样，一千余名的敌人，向高地集中了重机和轻机的火力以后，过了河向高地爬上来了。
    在秃山上很容易看清爬上来的敌人。人民军为了节约弹药从山上摔下石头，最前面的敌人的重机枪和轻机枪不少被石头碰坏。被石头砸着的敌人来不及惨叫就仰倒在地上了，但是敌人们硬着头皮仍在往上爬，敌人的一部已爬到顶上来了，但遭到人民军的手榴弹的袭击又都退下去。
    这样的冲锋和反冲锋反复了数次，最后敌人以全部兵力开始向上发动了总攻。人民军在这种炽烈的战斗中，已牺牲了两位小队长，但马上又有人站在他的位置。经过将近四小时的炽烈战斗后，敌人开始混乱，丢掉百余名的尸首惊慌的逃走了。
    这时，指挥处还没有指示，夜间二时许的时候，敌人又以一个大队的兵力包围了这个高地，剩下三十余名的人民军战斗员，都下了最后决心。
    敌人快要到高地了，完全被包围的人民军战斗员，都捡出了手榴弹，只等着朴大熙同志的命令，朴大熙同志从小袋里拿出了党证，想着：
    “这是党证。我受着党的培养。我的身体虽然在此地牺牲，但不能叫敌人抢走我的党证。”
    他把党证放进嘴里，准备最后咽下去。
    时间沉重的过着，一分钟又一分钟！
    战斗任务从这个战壕向那个战壕都传达了。每个战士的心，以生命、血和骨肉，坚守着祖国的每一寸土地。
    开始射击！
    代理小队长朴大熙同志，打出开始射击的信号弹。
    到处响起了冲锋枪声，暴雨般的向敌人打过去。枪身烧的通红。敌人遭到猛烈的射击后，开始混乱，人民军战斗员们突进混乱的敌人中，展开了勇敢的白刃战。
    打完了子弹只剩下手榴弹了，战士们抱着手榴弹，跳进敌人密集的地方。
    手榴弹、肉弹……
    这种忘我的牺牲精神，只有为祖国为领袖和为人民的自由幸福而斗争的人才能做到。
    在近两小时的白刃战中，敌人丢掉无数的尸体，向山脚退下去了。
    这样，××区分队的第三小队全体战斗员们，到指挥处有命令为止，一直坚守了××高地。
