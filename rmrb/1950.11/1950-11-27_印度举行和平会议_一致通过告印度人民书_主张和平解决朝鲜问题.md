The resolution on the Korean issue passed by the conference stated: The Korean incident is of special significance to the Indian people. The crimes committed against the Korean people are crimes against humanity and a challenge to all Asian nations. The resolution condemned armed intervention and demanded a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in the Security Council with representatives of the People's Republic of China participating.

　　The conference unanimously passed a Letter to the Indian People. The letter to the people stated: We, the Indian people, want peace, not war. In our ardent desire to strive for peace, we are not isolated. Standing with us are peace-loving people all over the world. Opposing us are only a handful of power-hungry imperialists and selfish war profiteers who seek to profit from the suffering of others. We believe that the universal determination to strive for peace is an invincible force. We, the Indian peace advocates, resolutely forbid war and support the various proposals of the World Peace Congress.

    主张和平解决朝鲜问题
    【新华社二十六日讯】据印度十字路周报报道：全印和平会议于十月二十八、二十九两日在孟买举行，出席者有各政党和团体的代表近一百名。“让印度和平运动扩大而深化”是代表们在讨论保卫世界和平的重大问题中的中心意志。
    会议由曾赴西班牙及中国的印度医疗队队长爱德华任主席。他在致开幕词时说：世界和平大会秘书处曾指出，鉴于目前的局势和另一次战争的紧迫危险，和平运动应该包括不分政治思想、宗教信仰和社会地位的所有人民，是十分必要的。
    会议在经过讨论后，通过了向第二届世界保卫和平大会致贺的决议，通过了谴责用警察干涉和平运动并要求印度政府恢复一切限制进行和平运动的自由的决议。
    会议要求印度在联合国支持和平政策。会议通过的关于朝鲜问题的决议写道：朝鲜事件对印度人民说来，具有特殊的意义。对朝鲜人民所犯的罪行，乃反人类的罪行，并且是对亚洲各民族的挑战。决议谴责武装干涉，并要求在有中华人民共和国代表参加的安理会中，和平解决朝鲜问题。
    会议一致通过告印度人民书。告人民书写道：我们印度人民，要和平不要战争。在我们争取和平的热情的愿望中，我们不是孤立的。同我们站在一起的是全世界爱好和平的人民。反对我们的仅仅是一小撮追求权力的帝国主义分子和希图从别人的痛苦当中获取利润的、自私的战争贩子。我们相信：争取和平的普遍决心，是一个不可战胜的力量。我们印度和平拥护者坚决地不许战争，并拥护世界保卫和平大会的各项建议。
