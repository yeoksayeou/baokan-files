Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing: The people's armed forces in the Southern Sichuan Military Region have grown rapidly, and to date, the entire region has developed to hundreds of thousands of people. Under the leadership of the Farmers' Associations, farmers in various places are eager to establish armed organizations for the purpose of bandit defense and self-defense. Farmers in the Third District of Weiyuan County organized a joint defense team of more than 5,000 people within five days, most of whom are members of the Farmers' Association. In order to improve the quality of the people's armed forces, the military departments of the local county people's governments have set up training classes for militia cadres. Three hundred cadres from the Zizhong County Joint Defense Team have already participated in training.

In the six months from May to October this year, the people's armed forces throughout the region have made remarkable achievements in coordinating with the People's Liberation Army in suppressing bandits and eliminating special agents. According to incomplete statistics, the people's armed forces of various counties have captured more than 100 bandit leaders alone. These include Chen Chao, the bandit "Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Communist National Salvation Army of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou," who was directly commanded by the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret service, and Huang Ke Ping, the bandit "Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese People's National Salvation Army," as well as more than ten other major bandit leaders. The people's armed forces of Changning County annihilated more than 2,100 bandits in one battle while assisting the People's Liberation Army Public Security Forces in bandit suppression operations. The Miao people's armed forces in Xuyong, Gusong, and Gulan counties achieved brilliant results in annihilating more than 360 bandits with 40 militiamen in half a year. At the oath-taking conferences held in Jianwei, Leshan, Neijiang and other counties, the members of the Joint Defense Team firmly expressed their determination to fight for the thorough elimination of bandits and the suppression of counter-revolutionary activities.
