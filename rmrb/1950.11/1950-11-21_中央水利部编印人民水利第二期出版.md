　　The second issue of "People's Water Conservancy," compiled and printed by the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central Government, has now been published. This issue first summarizes the achievements of the people across the country in the fight against floods and publishes excerpts of the work summary reports from various regions regarding water conservancy, providing readers with a general understanding of the water conservancy work nationwide this year.

　　Secondly, it systematically explains the occurrence of the Huai River flood this year, the methods for permanent control, and the dynamics of Huai River management. In particular, Xie Jiaze was invited to organize and publish the analysis of this year's Huai River flood by the hydrology group of the Central Huai River Management Conference, so that readers can more clearly understand the actual situation of this year's Huai River flood.

　　In addition, water conservancy expert Zhang Guangdou was specially invited to write an article entitled "Outline of the Survey and Planning of the Tong-Meng Section Reservoir Project on the Yellow River" to deepen everyone's understanding of the preparatory work for reservoir projects. Although the content of this article focuses on the Tong-Meng section, it emphasizes the principles involved, which will not only be of great help when the Tong-Meng section reservoir project is implemented in the future, but also of considerable reference value in other regions.

　　He Jialian's translation of Soviet hydrological undertakings will obviously provide important enlightenment for our country's ongoing hydrological undertakings.

　　In addition, there are more than ten excellent works, such as the overview of water conservancy in Xinjiang Province, irrigation communications in Shaanxi and Gansu, and silhouettes of water conservancy labor models. The content of this issue is quite substantial, with more than 70 pages and more than 100,000 words in a 16-page format.

　　The basic price of each issue is five yuan, and Xinhua bookstores in major cities across the country are selling them on consignment.
