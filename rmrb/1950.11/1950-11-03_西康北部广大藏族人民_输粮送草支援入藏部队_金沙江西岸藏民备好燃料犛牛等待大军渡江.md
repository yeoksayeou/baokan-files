Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd. The People's Liberation Army troops advancing into Tibet have received active support and welcome from the broad masses of Tibetan people in the northern Xikang area. In the three months since the PLA arrived in Dengke County on the east bank of the Jinsha River, more than 5,000 Tibetan people in the county transported a total of 400,000 catties of firewood and grass from afar to support the PLA. The unit experienced a grain shortage at one point, but because the Tibetan people of the entire county sold 817 dan of grain and 334 head of cattle and sheep, the unit safely overcame the grain shortage. When the troops advanced to the west bank of the Jinsha River, they also received active support from the Tibetan people of Dengke. The Linyue supply station under the county alone supplied the PLA with 510,000 catties of firewood, grass and horse feed in 20 days. The Tibetan district chief of the supply station, Baba, personally collected and released the materials, often working from dawn to midnight. Tibetan people in Shiqu County, a pastoral area in northern Xikang bordering Qinghai, concentrated 6,000 yaks, 2,500 leather pockets, and 400 Tibetan felt blankets to support the PLA in mid-September. In order to see the PLA use these supplies with their own eyes, they waited at the supply station for 20 days. Tibetan people near the urban area of Dege County and near Yulong in the northeast also supported the PLA with 8,000 yaks. Tibetan people in Zhuqing, northeast of Dege County, concentrated 70,000 catties of horse grass and more than 100,000 catties of dry firewood in 20 days, and organized a team of 800 yaks to help with transportation. The broad masses of Tibetan people in Ganzi, Baiyu, Daofu, Luhuo and other counties also organized transportation with yaks or assisted in road construction, giving enthusiastic support to the PLA.

Before the army crossed the river, Tibetan people from all walks of life on the west bank of the Jinsha River continuously sent representatives to secretly cross the river to the east bank, requesting the army to cross the river as soon as possible. The Tibetan people in the western region of the Jinsha River and Tongpu in Dege County sent representatives as early as July and August to tell the PLA that they had secretly prepared a lot of fuel and yaks, waiting for the PLA to cross the river.

Some Tibetan people even prayed every day for the PLA to cross the river safely as soon as possible.

    输粮送草支援入藏部队
    金沙江西岸藏民备好燃料犛牛等待大军渡江
    【新华社重庆二日电】进军西藏的人民解放军部队受到西康北部地区广大藏族人民的积极支援和欢迎。解放军到达金沙江东岸邓柯县的三个多月中，该县五千余藏民从远地运来支援解放军的柴草共四十万斤。该部队有一时期曾发生粮荒，但因全县藏民卖给八百十七石粮食和三百三十四头牛羊，使该部安然渡过粮荒。部队向金沙江西岸推进时，也得到邓柯藏民的积极支援，仅该县所属之林药供应站在二十天中即以柴草马料五十一万斤供应解放军。供应站上的藏族区长八巴亲自收放物资，常常从天亮忙到夜半。西康极北毗邻青海的牧区石渠县藏民，在九月中旬就集中了支援解放军的犛牛六千头，皮口袋二千五百个和藏毡四百床。他们为了要亲眼看到解放军使用这项物资，曾在供应站上一直等了二十天。德格县城区附近及其东北部玉隆附近地区也以犛牛八千头支援解放军。德格县东北竹菁藏民在二十天中就集中了七万斤马草和十多万斤干柴，组织了八百头犛牛队帮助运输。甘孜、白玉、道孚、炉霍等县广大藏族人民也以犛牛组织运输或协助修路，给解放军以热烈支援。
    金沙江西岸的各阶层藏民，在大军渡江前，即不断选派代表偷渡江东，请求大军早日渡江。德格县金沙江西部地区和同普的藏民，早在七、八月间就派代表告诉解放军，他们已暗中准备好了许多燃料及犛牛，等待解放军过江。
    有的藏民每天甚至为解放军早日平安渡江而祈祷。
