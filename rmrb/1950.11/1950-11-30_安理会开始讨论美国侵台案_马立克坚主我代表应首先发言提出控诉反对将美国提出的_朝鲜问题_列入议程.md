(Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 29th) TASS, New York, November 29th: The Security Council held a meeting on November 27th. There were two items on the provisional agenda. The first item was the accusation of armed aggression against Taiwan. This issue was raised by the Soviet Union, which has resolutely advocated discussing this issue for several months. However, the majority of the Security Council member states, under pressure from the United States, have delayed the discussion of this accusation. On September 29th, the Security Council decided to invite representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of this issue after November 15th.

The second issue on the agenda was the so-called "Accusation of Aggression against the Republic of Korea."

After announcing the opening of the meeting, Security Council President Bebler proposed discussing both issues simultaneously, insisting that the two issues were interrelated. He then said: The Security Council has invited representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of these two issues. These representatives have now arrived and can express their opinions.

Soviet representative Malik opposed the President's attempt to include the Korean issue on the agenda. He pointed out that Bebler's explanation was hardly convincing. He said: The Soviet Union had requested the Security Council to hold a meeting to discuss the accusation of armed aggression against Taiwan. Malik said: The second issue was included on the agenda by the President; the Soviet delegation did not request that this issue be included on the agenda. Malik also pointed out that these issues had never appeared on the Security Council's agenda in this combined form. Malik pointed out: The "Accusation of Aggression against the Republic of Korea" was proposed and drafted by the United States, and this accusation was neither approved by the Soviet government nor by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. Malik continued: The "Korean Question" was raised by the United States on June 25th, while the Taiwan question was raised by the Soviet Union on August 22nd. However, the Security Council President now combines these two issues into one, and further divides it into items one and two; and Bebler insists that this is done with the consent of the parties concerned. Malik asked the President which parties he was referring to. If he was referring to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, then its representatives have attended the meeting, and the Security Council can listen to their opinions.

Malik then pointed out that, judging from Zhou Enlai's telegram of November 11th, the Chinese People's Government was not prepared to participate in the discussion of MacArthur's "Special Report" because the Security Council's invitation of November 8th restricted the Chinese People's Government to discussing the report of the so-called "United Nations Unified Command," which the Chinese People's Government did not recognize.

Malik recalled that Zhou Enlai's telegram pointed out that, given that the U.S. aggression against Korea and the U.S. aggression against Taiwan were linked, the U.S. aggression against Taiwan issue and the U.S. armed intervention in Korea issue should be discussed together so that representatives of the Chinese People's Government could discuss these two closely related issues.

Malik concluded by saying that the Security Council must begin discussing the Taiwan issue and reject the attempt to forcibly drag MacArthur's "Special Report" into the discussion, which the Chinese People's Government refused to discuss separately from the entire Korean issue.

The President acknowledged that the Soviet delegation had only requested that the issue of armed aggression against Taiwan be included on the agenda; but he also said that the U.S. delegation had requested that the "Korean Question" be included on the agenda, on the grounds that the discussion of this issue had not been completed. Bebler wanted to justify the practice of merging the issue raised by the U.S. delegation with the issue raised by the Soviet delegation in some way, so he insisted that this was the only "practical" way for representatives of the Chinese Central People's Government to discuss the Korean issue. He "explained" that because the Korean issue had always been discussed as the "Accusation of Aggression against the Republic of Korea" in the past, he could not include this issue on the agenda according to Zhou Enlai's proposed formulation, namely the U.S. armed intervention in Korea issue.

U.S. representative Austin revealed who was pulling the strings behind Titoist Bebler's proposal; he spoke in favor of simultaneously discussing the "Korean Question" and the Taiwan question. He rudely declared that the representatives of the People's Republic of China were not invited to decide on the agenda, and their wishes were irrelevant.

Austin attempted to distort the meaning of Zhou Enlai's telegram to the Security Council, insisting that it appeared from these telegrams that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China wanted to merge the issue of armed aggression against Taiwan with the "Korean Question" as raised by the United States in the way proposed by the United States.

British representative Jebb supported the agenda proposed by Bebler. In doing so, Jebb attempted to slander the position of the People's Republic of China.

Malik then spoke. He said that Bebler and Austin were trying to make the Security Council believe that China itself had suggested merging the Taiwan and Korean issues for discussion, but what China wanted was to merge these issues for discussion in a different way.

Malik recalled that the U.S. delegation had opposed the Soviet Union's proposal that representatives of the Chinese People's Government fully participate in the discussion of the Korean issue. He said that although the Security Council's resolution of November 8th restricted this participation to the discussion of MacArthur's "Special Report," Austin now insisted that he supported their full participation in the discussion of this issue.

Malik pointed out during further debate that spending two and a half hours discussing procedural issues was not a waste of time, because Austin revealed that he wanted to force the representatives of the Chinese People's Government to discuss MacArthur's notorious "Special Report." Malik said that the Soviet delegation would insist that there could only be one item on the agenda—the accusation of armed aggression against Taiwan.

The Soviet Union's amendment to the provisional agenda was put to a vote and was rejected by seven votes against one and three abstentions (India, Egypt, and Ecuador).

President Bebler then invited representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to take their seats in the Security Council. He also invited representatives of the Lee Seung-man group to attend, "according to the Security Council's resolution of June 25th."

Bebler allowed Austin to speak. When Austin began to speak, Malik requested to speak on a point of order. Bebler, obediently serving the U.S. delegation, refused to allow Malik to speak. Malik finally obtained the right to speak, and he pointed out that, according to recognized rules, the country that filed the accusation had the right to speak first in order to present its accusation. The accusing party presents its views first, and then the defendant presents its views. Malik asked: Why should the United States, which is the defendant in the aggression against Taiwan, be allowed to speak first?

After being caught in the act of manipulating the proceedings, Bebler changed his attitude and said that he would let the Security Council decide who should speak first.

Since the meeting had already been going on for a long time, he suggested adjourning the meeting. This suggestion was adopted.

### 安理会开始讨论美国侵台案  马立克坚主我代表应首先发言提出控诉反对将美国提出的“朝鲜问题”列入议程

　　安理会开始讨论美国侵台案
    马立克坚主我代表应首先发言提出控诉
    反对将美国提出的“朝鲜问题”列入议程
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社纽约二十九日讯：安全理事会于十一月二十七日举行会议。临时议程上有两个问题。第一个问题是控诉武装侵略台湾案。这个问题是苏联提出的，苏联好几个月以来一直坚决主张讨论这个问题。但是安全理事会的多数理事国却在美国的压力下，拖延对这个控诉案的讨论。安全理事会曾在九月二十九日决定邀请中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表在十一月十五日以后参加这个问题的讨论。
    议程上的第二个问题是所谓“控诉对大韩民国的侵略案”。
    安全理事会主席贝勃勒在宣布开会以后，提议同时讨论这两个问题，硬说这两个问题是彼此相关的。他接着说：安全理事会已邀请中华人民共和国的代表参加这两个问题的讨论。这些代表现在已经到达，他们可以表示他们的意见。
    苏联代表马立克反对主席把朝鲜问题列入议程的企图。他指出：贝勃勒的解释是很难说服人的。他说：苏联曾要求安全理事会举行会议，以便讨论控诉武装侵略台湾案。马立克说：第二个问题是被主席列入议程的，苏联代表团并没有要求把这个问题列入议程。马立克同时指出：这些问题从来没有在安全理事会的议程上以这种合并在一起的形式出现过。马立克指出：“控诉对大韩民国的侵略案”是美国提出并起草的，这个控诉案既未得到苏联政府的同意，也未得到中华人民共和国中央人民政府的同意；马立克接着说：“朝鲜问题”是美国在六月二十五日提出的，而台湾问题则是苏联在八月二十二日提出的。但是安全理事会主席现在却把这两个问题合并成一个问题，又把它细分为第一项和第二项；而且贝勃勒还硬说这样做是得到有关方面的同意的。马立克问主席到底指的是那方面。如果他说的是中华人民共和国中央人民政府，那末它的代表已出席会议，安全理事会可以听取他们的意见。
    马立克接着指出：从周恩来十一月十一日的电报来判断，中国人民政府并不预备参加对麦克阿瑟“特别报告”的讨论，因为安全理事会十一月八日的邀请将中国人民政府限制在讨论中国人民政府所不承认的所谓“联合国统一司令部”的报告上面。
    马立克追述称：周恩来的电报指出，鉴于美国侵略朝鲜与美国侵略台湾是联系着的，所以应该将美国侵略台湾问题和美国武装干涉朝鲜问题合并讨论，以便中国人民政府代表得以讨论这两个密切联系着的问题。
    马立克末了说：安全理事会必须开始讨论台湾问题，并拒绝把麦克阿瑟的“特别报告”硬拉进来讨论的企图，这个报告是中国人民政府拒绝与整个朝鲜问题分开来讨论的。
    主席承认苏联代表团仅要求将武装侵略台湾问题列入议程；但他又说：美国代表团曾要求将“朝鲜问题”列入议程，理由是：对这个问题的讨论还没有完成。贝勃勒想至少以某种方法来为把美国代表团所提出的问题与苏联代表团所提出的问题合并讨论的做法辩护，于是就硬说：这是唯一使中国中央人民政府的代表得以讨论朝鲜问题的“实际”方法。他“解释”道：由于朝鲜问题过去一向是当作“控诉对大韩民国侵略案”来讨论的，因此他不能按照周恩来所建议的提法，即美国武装干涉朝鲜的问题把这个问题列入议程。
    美国代表奥斯汀泄露了躲在铁托分子贝勃勒建议的后面牵线的到底是谁；他发言赞成同时讨论“朝鲜问题”和台湾问题。他无礼地宣称：中华人民共和国的代表并不是被邀请来决定议程问题的，他们的愿望是无关紧要的。
    奥斯汀企图歪曲周恩来致安全理事会的电报的意义，硬说从这些电报看来中华人民共和国中央人民政府想将武装侵略台湾问题与美国那种照美国提法提出来的“朝鲜问题”合并讨论。
    英国代表杰伯支持贝勃勒所建议的议程。在这样做的时候，杰伯企图中伤中华人民共和国的立场。
    马立克随后发言。他说：贝勃勒和奥斯汀企图使安全理事会相信是中国自己建议要台湾和朝鲜问题合并讨论，但是中国所要的是在另一种方式下把这些问题合并讨论。
    马立克追述美国代表团曾经反对苏联所提出的关于中国人民政府的代表充分参加讨论朝鲜问题的建议。他说：虽然安全理事会十一月八日的决议把这种参加限制在讨论麦克阿瑟的“特别报告”上面，但奥斯汀现在硬说他支持他们充分参加这个问题的讨论。
    马立克在进一步辩论时指出：花费二个半小时讨论程序问题并不是白费的，因为奥斯汀泄露了他想强使中国人民政府的代表讨论臭名昭著的麦克阿瑟的“特别报告”。马立克说：苏联代表团将坚持议程上只能有一项议程——控诉武装侵略台湾案。
    苏联对临时议程所提出的修正案提付表决，并以七票对一票及三票弃权（印度、埃及和厄瓜多尔）被否决。
    主席贝勃勒随后邀请中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表在安全理事会中入座。他并且“根据安全理事会六月二十五日的决议”邀请李承晚集团的代表列席。
    贝勃勒准许奥斯汀发言。当奥斯汀开始发言时，马立克要求就议事进程发言。顺从地为美国代表团服务的贝勃勒，拒绝让马立克发言。马立克终于得到了发言权，他指出按照公认的规则，提出控诉的国家有权首先发言，以便提出它的控诉。控诉的一方首先提出它的意见，然后被告再提出它的意见。马立克问道：为什么侵略台湾而身为被告一方的美国倒能首先发言呢？
    贝勃勒玩弄手段被当场抓住之后，改变了他的态度说：他将让安全理事会决定谁应先发言的问题。
    由于会议已开始了很久，所以他建议休会。这个建议被通过。
