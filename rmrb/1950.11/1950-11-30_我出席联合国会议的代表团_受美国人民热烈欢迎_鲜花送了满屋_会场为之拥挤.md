Xinhua News Agency, 29th: New York dispatch: Our delegation attending the United Nations Security Council and the Political Committee of the General Assembly to discuss the case of accusing the United States of aggression against Taiwan was warmly welcomed by the American people. The delegation attended the United Nations meeting for the first time on the 27th, and the venue was crowded. Workers' organizations and people from all walks of life in the United States sent a room full of flowers to our delegation, which was more welcoming than any new delegation before.

　　Before our delegation entered the crowded meeting hall of the Political Committee on the 27th, everyone's eyes were already fixed on the door. When representative Wu Xiuquan and other members of the delegation appeared in the chamber, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, who was denouncing the American aggression, immediately interrupted his speech to welcome the legitimate representatives of the Chinese government and wish our delegation success.

　　The United Nations staff in charge of the meeting cleared a row of seats for our delegation in the official seating area, connected to the British delegation's seats. There were seat markers with the words "People's Republic of China" on the table. The British representative Younger and the American representative Dulles both pretended to be calm about the arrival of our representatives and made no indication. Dulles even deliberately pretended not to notice.

　　When the committee adjourned, a group of reporters and photographers swarmed up and surrounded our delegation to take pictures.

　　我出席联合国会议的代表团
    受美国人民热烈欢迎
    鲜花送了满屋·会场为之拥挤
    【新华社二十九日讯】纽约消息：我出席联合国安理会及大会政治委员会讨论控诉美国侵略台湾案的代表团，受到美国人民的热烈欢迎。代表团于二十七日首次出席联合国会议，会场为之拥挤。美国各地工人组织和其他各界人民给我代表团送了一屋子的花，较前此对任何一个新代表团的欢迎为多。
    二十七日当我代表团进入政委会拥挤的会议厅以前，大家的眼睛早就注视着门口。当我伍修权代表及其他代表团人员出现于议厅时，正在斥责美国侵略行动的苏联外长维辛斯基立即中断其演说，向合法的中国政府代表表示欢迎并祝我代表团成功。
    联合国照料开会的人员为我代表团在官方席清出了一排位置，与英国代表席相连。桌上有中华人民共和国字样的席位标帜。英代表杨格和美代表杜勒斯对我代表的到场都故作镇静，不作表示。杜勒斯并特意装出不注意的样子。
    当委员会散会时，一群记者及摄影师蜂涌而上，围住我代表团摄影。
