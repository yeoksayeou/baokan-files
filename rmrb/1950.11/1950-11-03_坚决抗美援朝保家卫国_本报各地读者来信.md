Resolutely Resist America and Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country
Letters from Readers Across the Country in This Newspaper
Our People Unite and Rise Up
We Can Certainly Defeat American Imperialism Editor Comrade:
At the National Congress of Model Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, Premier Zhou reported to us the crimes of American imperialism in bombing and slaughtering the people of friendly Korea, and bombing Andong in our country. The hatred of all of us model representatives for American imperialism has deepened even further. Recalling the past, the Japanese invaders also invaded us, treating us with the "Three Alls" policy, but the people of the whole country, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, defeated the Japanese devils; later, the Kuomintang reactionaries attacked us again, and we defeated them again under the leadership of Chairman Mao; therefore, the People's Republic of China could be established, the people became the masters of the country, and I became a model representative. These facts will never be forgotten. Now American imperialists are invading our Taiwan, invading Korea, and strafing the people of Northeast China, and recently they invaded our Shandong coast. The series of aggressive crimes of American imperialism makes us unable to tolerate it. I resolutely support Premier Zhou's protest to the United Nations.
Since the end of the Model Worker Congress, I have been to the Hebei Provincial Government, Baoding No. 2 Middle School, Workers and Peasants Accelerated Middle School, Women Cadre School, Dingxian Prefectural Office, Hebei Provincial Normal School, and my hometown (Wu'an Village, Qingyuan), and returned to the High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University. In these schools and institutions, in addition to reporting on the Model Worker Congress and the process of my research on the slide rule method, I also promoted the aggressive crimes of American imperialism to them. The audience totaled more than 10,000 people. They all expressed that they would definitely defend the security of our motherland, and take practical action in various positions to strive to support the People's Liberation Army, and demanded that the US imperialism compensate our people for any losses suffered from the bombing by US aircraft.
This time, American imperialism rashly launched a war of aggression, disrupting our country's security and undermining world peace. As long as the peace-loving people of the world unite, as long as the Chinese people unite and rise up under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao to defend the motherland and protect peace, they can certainly defeat American imperialism.

American Imperialism's Invasion of Korea Has Affected Our Border
We Should Not Be Paralyzed, We Must Prepare to Strike Back Hard Editor Comrade:
As long as imperialism exists, its aggressive ambitions will not die. American imperialism, under the guise of the United Nations, is not only directly invading Korea and our Taiwan, but also trying its best to expand the war of aggression. The American planes' invasion of our country's airspace and the bombing of our Northeast people is a clear example. It wants to stand on the heads of the people forever, arbitrarily oppress and exploit the people, and prevent the people from ever turning over.
Although a world war has not broken out, the war of aggression launched by American imperialism has affected our country's borders. The people of our country should not be paralyzed, we should strengthen our vigilance, we should unite closely, and prepare to give the enemy a head-on blow.
The working class must unite closely with the people of the whole country, and in order to defend peace and consolidate our victory, take active action to do a good job in economic construction, combine with the great production competition, use our brains, and study technology. Only by doing a good job in production, strengthening national defense, can victory be consolidated, imperialism be defeated, and life be improved.
We must not only actively produce, but also raise our vigilance, publicize the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism to the broad masses of people, expose the rumors of special agents, so that the enemy has no opportunity to take advantage of.
The people of China and the peace-loving people of the world unite to oppose the aggression of imperialism, and imperialism will surely perish.

Hand in Good Public Grain to Support the People's Liberation Army
Consolidate National Defense and Strike at the Aggressors Editor Comrade:
American imperialism's invasion of Korea and the use of airplanes to bomb our Northeast is truly unreasonable. The masses in our village are paying public grain. The masses all say: If the Communist Party hadn't come to lead us to turn over, where would we have our own land to cultivate? Today, American imperialism is coming to bully us again. We must hand in good public grain, hand it in quickly, support the People's Liberation Army, and consolidate our national defense strength. The masses in our village are actively carrying out autumn plowing and preparing for large-scale production next spring. We must produce more grain and increase our national defense strength.

American Imperialism Already Owes Us a Blood Debt
We Must Make It Repay It with Blood Editor Comrade:
The American imperialist air force invading Korea has recently invaded our country's airspace many times, and carried out bombing and strafing, killing and wounding our people, and causing damage to the property of the Chinese people; at the same time, the American troops invading Korea are advancing wildly towards our country's border, seriously threatening the safety of the Chinese people. We must not tolerate this aggressive crime of American imperialism. We should take the most active and effective actions to stop the aggression of American imperialism and resolutely support the Korean people's war of liberation. For the sake of the safety of the Chinese people, I will be ready to contribute everything I have at any time to defend the border of the motherland. The air force of American imperialism has killed and wounded our compatriots and owes the Chinese people a blood debt, and we must make American imperialism repay it with blood!

Determined to Devote the Greatest Strength
Strive to Defend the Motherland Editor Comrade:
We clearly understand that the American imperialists are vainly attempting to use war to change the course of historical development, to solve their external and internal contradictions and difficulties, to consolidate the position of monopoly capital, and to achieve world domination. Such an aggressive policy of American imperialism is seriously threatening peace in Asia and the world.
Because of past history, we now have a deeper understanding that American imperialism is constantly violating the basic rights, democracy, and freedom of the people. It is adopting fascist suppression against democratic and progressive forces, and carrying out bloody massacres, looting, and rape against peaceful people. These imperialist crimes are even worse than those of the Japanese fascist bandits.
The Korean people are showing unparalleled resolve and heroic spirit in the just war against American aggression. We believe in the truth that victory belongs to the people. However, American imperialism is frantically expanding the war, engaging in aggression, and directly threatening the security of China.
We, the educators of the university, love peace and need peace to restore and develop our cultural and educational undertakings. However, when the motherland is threatened and our undertakings are hindered, we are never afraid to resist the war of aggression.
We resolutely support Premier Zhou's report: "The Chinese people cannot tolerate foreign aggression, nor can they allow imperialism to wantonly invade their neighbors and ignore it." We are willing and determined to devote our greatest strength to fight for the defense of the motherland.

　　坚决抗美援朝保家卫国
    本报各地读者来信
    我国人民一致奋起
    一定可以打败美帝编辑同志：
    在全国工农兵劳模代表会议上，周总理给我们报告了美帝轰炸、屠杀友邦朝鲜人民，并炸我安东的罪行。我们全体劳模代表对美帝的仇恨更加深了。回忆起来，过去日寇也曾侵略过我们，用“三光”政策对待我们，可是全国人民在毛主席领导下，把日本鬼子打败了；后来国民党反动派又进攻我们，我们在毛主席领导下又打败了他们；因此中华人民共和国才能建立，人民才做了国家的主人，我自己才当了劳模代表。这些事实是永远不会忘记的。现在美帝国主义者侵略我国台湾，侵略朝鲜，并扫射我国东北人民，最近又侵犯我山东沿海。美帝一连串的侵略罪行，使我们忍无可忍。周总理向联合国提出的抗议，我坚决拥护。
    我自劳模大会结束后，到过河北省政府、保定第二中学、工农速成中学、妇干学校、定县专署、河北省立师范和我的家乡（清苑武安村），又回到北京师大附中。在以上这些学校、机关中，我除报告了劳模大会及我研究的尺算法的经过之外，并向他们宣传了美帝侵略罪行。听众共有一万余人。他们都纷纷表示，一定保卫我们祖国的安全，并在各个不同的工作岗位上，实际行动起来，努力支援人民解放军，并要求美帝赔偿我国人民遭受美机轰炸的任何损失。
    这次美帝冒险发动侵略战争，扰乱我国的安全，破坏世界和平，只要全世界爱好和平的人民团结起来，只要中国人民一致奋起在共产党毛主席的领导下捍卫祖国，保卫和平，一定可以把美帝打败。
    工业劳模  于振善
    美帝侵朝已波及我国边境
    不应麻痹要准备予以痛击编辑同志：
    帝国主义存在一天，它的侵略野心是不会死的。美帝国主义盗用联合国名义，不但直接侵略朝鲜及我国台湾，它还千方百计地扩大侵略战争。美机侵略我国领空，并轰炸我东北人民，就是一个显明的例子。它想永远站在人民头上作威作福，任意压迫与剥削人民，使人民永远翻不了身。
    世界大战虽未起来，但美帝发动的侵略战争已波及我国的边境。我们全国人民不应麻痹，应加强警惕，应紧密地团结起来，准备给敌人以迎头痛击。
    工人阶级要和全国人民紧密地团结在一起，为了保卫和平，巩固我们的胜利，积极的行动起来，搞好经济建设，结合生产大竞赛，开动脑筋，钻研技术。只有搞好生产，国防强大，胜利才能巩固，帝国主义才能被打垮，生活才能改善。
    我们不但要积极生产，并且要提高警惕性，向广大人民宣传美帝的侵略野心，揭发特务的谣言，使敌人无机可乘。
    全中国及全世界爱好和平的人民团结起来，反对帝国主义的侵略，帝国主义一定会灭亡的。
            工业劳模  阎金芬
    交好公粮支援解放军
    巩固国防打击侵略者编辑同志：
    美帝侵略朝鲜，又用飞机轰炸我东北，真是无理之极。我村群众正在缴公粮。群众都说：共产党要不来领导咱们翻身，那里还有自己的地种？今天美帝又来期负我们。我们一定缴好的公粮，快交，支援解放军，巩固国防力量。我村群众正积极进行秋耕，并准备明春大生产。我们要多打粮食，增加国防力量。
            农业劳模  刘金荣
    美帝已欠下我们的血债
    一定要叫它用血来偿还编辑同志：
    美帝侵朝空军近来多次侵入我国上空，并进行轰炸与扫射，杀伤了我国人民，使中国人民的财产也受到了损失；同时，侵朝美军更疯狂地向我国边境推进，严重地威胁着中国人民的安全。我们对美帝国主义的这种侵略罪行决不能容忍。我们应采取最积极最有效的行动来制止美帝的侵略，坚决支援朝鲜人民解放战争。为了中国人民的安全，我将随时准备贡献出我自己的一切，以保卫祖国的边疆。美帝国主义的空军，已杀伤了我们的同胞，欠下了中国人民的血债，我们要叫美帝用血来偿还！
          部队工作模范  王訏谟
    决心献出最大力量
    为保卫祖国而奋斗编者同志：
    我们清楚地了解美帝国主义者，妄想用战争来改变历史发展的进程，来解决他的外在和内在的矛盾与困难，来巩固独占资本的地位，并取得世界统治。美国帝国主义这样的侵略政策，正严重的威胁着亚洲和全世界的和平。
    由于过去的历史，我们现在更加深切的认识到美帝国主义正不断的侵犯人民的基本权利，民主和自由。对于民主进步力量采取着法西斯镇压，对于和平人民施行血腥屠杀，掳掠和奸淫，这些帝国主义罪行，比之日本法西斯强盗实有过之而无不及。
    朝鲜人民正在反对美国侵略的正义战争中，表现出无比坚决勇敢的英雄气概。我们相信胜利是属于人民的这条真理。可是美国帝国主义疯狂地扩大战争，肆行侵略，直接威胁着中国的安全。
    我们，大学的教育工作者爱好和平，而且需要和平以恢复发展我们的文化教育事业，然而在祖国受到威胁，迫使我们所进行的事业受到阻碍的时候，我们也决不害怕反抗侵略战争。
    我们坚决拥护周总理的报告：“中国人民不能容忍外国的侵略，也不能听任帝国主义对自己的邻人肆行侵略而置之不理。”我们愿意并且决心献出最大的力量，为保卫祖国而奋斗。
