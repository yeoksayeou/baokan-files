　　US Telecommunications Union Workers
　　Launch Nationwide Strike
    [Xinhua News Agency, 10th] The United States' Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO)-affiliated Telecommunications Workers Union launched a nationwide strike on the 9th. According to a Reuter's report, the Telecommunications Workers Union, with 33,000 members, is demanding wage increases from companies with huge profits. After negotiations with the companies failed to yield results, the workers, disregarding the compromising line of the CIO's right-wing leaders, decided to support their reasonable demands with a strike. The companies attempted to entice the workers to accept the so-called "long-term contract" method proposed by right-wing labor leaders (i.e., workers must guarantee not to demand wage increases for a long period, in exchange for a slight increase in current wages), but the workers rejected this deceptive trap. The strike will paralyze the national telecommunications network.

　　美电讯工会工人
　　举行全国性罢工
    【新华社十日讯】美国产联所属的电讯工人工会于九日发动全国性罢工。据电通社消息，拥有三万三千会员的电讯工人工会要求获得巨额利润的公司增加工人工资。在与公司交涉得不到结果之后，工人们不顾产联右翼领导的妥协路线，决定以罢工支持他们的合理要求。公司方面曾企图诱使工人接受右翼劳工领袖提出的所谓“长期合同”办法（即工人须保证在一个长时期内不得再要求增加工资，作为略微提高目前工资的交换条件），但工人拒绝了这个欺骗的圈套。罢工将使全国电讯网陷于瘫痪。
