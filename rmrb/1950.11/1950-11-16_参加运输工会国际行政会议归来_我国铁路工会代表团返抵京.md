    【本报讯】前往波兰出席陆空运输工人工会国际行政委员会会议的中国铁路工会代表团李颉伯等十一人，业于本月十四日上午七时返抵北京。
    该次运输工会国际行政委员会议于九月十八日在波兰首都华沙召开。会议的主要议程系讨论运输工会国际成立一年来的工作情况及加强世界陆空运输工人的团结、反对帝国主义侵略战争、保卫世界和平；并补选中国铁路工会主席李颉伯为运输工会国际副主席。
    中国铁路工会代表团在参加运输工会国际行政委员会议后，曾在苏联逗留一月，学习铁路工会工作。代表团除在莫斯科学习，参观外，并访问了列宁格勒与基辅等地。代表团在各处均受到苏联人民热烈的欢迎和协助。此次从苏联学得的宝贵的先进经验，对于今后中国铁路工会建设工作将有很好的帮助。
