Xinhua News Agency, November 29th: TASS, New York, November 28th—As previously reported, the United Nations General Assembly Political Committee has begun discussing the issue of the "Soviet Accusation of U.S. Aggression Against China," which was included on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly at the suggestion of the Soviet delegation. In the previous meeting, despite the opposition of the U.S. bloc's delegations, the Political Committee still decided by a majority vote to invite representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to attend the Political Committee meetings and participate in the discussion of the "Soviet Accusation of U.S. Aggression Against China" case. The nature of the issue currently being discussed and the arrival of the delegation of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China have drawn special attention not only from people within the United Nations organization but also from people outside the United Nations organization. The meeting of the Political Committee began in a crowded hall. The Chairman of the Political Committee, in announcing the beginning of the meeting, informed the meeting that he had received a telegram from the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China authorizing a delegation headed by Wu Xiuquan, which was already at the United Nations, to participate in the discussion of the above-mentioned issue. During the meeting, Wu Xiuquan and his entourage were seated at the table. Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation, on behalf of the Soviet delegation, extended greetings to the Chinese delegation and expressed the hope that their work would be successful. Vyshinsky delivered a speech at the meeting, elaborating on the essence of the issue currently under discussion. His speech took up most of the committee's morning meeting, and the audience listened to his speech very attentively. Vyshinsky began by reminding the committee that on June 27, 1950, the U.S. President formally ordered the U.S. Seventh Fleet to take violent actions against China's Taiwan Island. Everyone knows that, according to this order, the U.S. Navy has been sent to the coast of Taiwan to implement a maritime blockade of the island and patrol the Taiwan Strait. Since then, the ports of Taiwan have become bases for the U.S. Navy, and soon after, the U.S. Air Force, along with its personnel, was also transferred to Taiwan. Vyshinsky said that the U.S. military has thus trampled on all the standards and principles of international law and illegally occupied Taiwan Island and its territorial waters, stationed in the Taiwan area like it was stationed in a conquered area, stationed on this island of China. Vyshinsky used the Cairo and Potsdam agreements to explain that Taiwan is Chinese territory, and reminded the Political Committee that Taiwan has belonged to China for generations. He emphasized that Taiwan is China's inalienable territory and an inseparable part of China. He also recounted that U.S. official representatives Truman and Acheson had repeatedly stated earlier this year that the U.S. would not interfere in the affairs of Taiwan and generally would not interfere in China's internal affairs. The U.S. State Department later also talked about this in its official statement on February 9, 1950. Vyshinsky read out the original text of this statement on the spot at the Political Committee meeting. Vyshinsky pointed out that, despite all these statements, the U.S. government has openly violated its obligations to Taiwan, seized the island, and sent troops to occupy it, thereby undermining China's territorial integrity and violently trampling on the basic standards of international law and the principles of the United Nations Charter. Vyshinsky reminded the Political Committee to pay attention to the statement made by U.S. President Truman when he issued the order to the U.S. Seventh Fleet, and the subsequent actions of the U.S. armed forces against Taiwan, and proved that the U.S. government, in its relations with China, has embarked on the road of implementing a policy of force in the most brutal way. He emphasized that at present, as demonstrated when the General Affairs Committee and the General Assembly plenary meeting discussed the issue of including the so-called "Formosa issue" on the agenda of the General Assembly, the U.S. ruling group intends to use the banner, flag, and name of the United Nations to conceal its own expansionist behavior against China's Taiwan Island, just as they did in Korea. Vyshinsky called the U.S. actions against China blatant acts of aggression, the purpose of which is to support the bankrupt Kuomintang group, which has been overthrown by the Chinese people, in its struggle against the only legitimate Chinese government of the Chinese people—the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. Vyshinsky detailed the history of U.S. interference in China and pointed out that the U.S. government not only continues to interfere in China's internal affairs, but also openly uses its own military in this struggle. Vyshinsky said that this matter itself proves the fact that the U.S. government has carried out armed aggression against China, and proves that the Soviet Union's accusation against this kind of illegal action by the U.S. ruling group is correct. Vyshinsky emphasized that U.S. aggression against China pursues far-reaching goals, one of which is to prevent the Kuomintang group from being driven out of its last nest, Taiwan Island, and thereby maintain a possibility for the U.S. to use this island as a military base for further U.S. aggression against China and aggression against the Far East. In his speech, Vyshinsky proved that the explanations of U.S. officials are groundless, hypocritical, and illusory; these officials insist that these acts of aggression were necessary because of the U.S. war in Korea, attempting to somewhat conceal the facts of U.S. aggression against China from world public opinion. Vyshinsky said that this explanation of the U.S. ruling group for the U.S. aggressive actions against China is precisely an admission of its own aggression while at the same time fabricating facts and distorting the truth, because the military actions in Korea were launched by U.S. interventionists. Vyshinsky asked the Political Committee to pay attention to some facts and documents, and then convincingly proved that the U.S. aggressive actions against China in the Taiwan region were fully and well prepared in advance. He also emphasized that the U.S. is not only invading China in Taiwan. Moreover, everyone knows that in the months since the end of this summer, U.S. military aircraft have continuously violated Chinese airspace in the border area between Manchuria and Korea, bombing and strafing Chinese territory, killing many Chinese lives, causing huge material losses to China, and causing repeated protests and indignation from the Chinese government and the Chinese people. Vyshinsky reminded the Political Committee to pay attention to the statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China on November 11 this year regarding the illegal actions of the U.S. ruling group against China. Vyshinsky said that the hatred of the U.S. ruling group for the democratic forces of the Chinese people and their national liberation struggle is well known to everyone and has a long history; he cited many facts of U.S. armed intervention in China's internal affairs since the armed suppression of the Chinese people's uprising called the "Boxer Movement" by foreign aggressors.

Vyshinsky further said: When a country—a member of the United Nations (which in the case we are talking about is the United States)—occupies a part of the territory of another sovereign country—a member of the United Nations, undermines its territorial integrity, interferes in its internal affairs, and uses its own military to participate in a civil war that has already ended with the complete victory of the Chinese people, the United Nations organization must not allow this situation to exist.

Vyshinsky pointed out that it is inappropriate for the United Nations to encourage the actions of this small group of rioters and conspirators who are hiding in Taiwan under the protection of the United States and protected by the U.S. military against the People's Republic of China.

At the end of his speech, Vyshinsky read out the Soviet delegation's proposal on the issue under discussion as follows:

"Accusation by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics of aggression against China by the United States of America.

Union of Soviet Socialist Republics

Proposal

Having considered the issue of U.S. aggression against China, having heard the statements of the delegation of the People's Republic of China on this issue, and the explanations of the U.S. delegation, in discussing the facts of the violation of the territorial integrity and its borders by the American naval and air forces, which are manifested in: A, the invasion of Taiwan Island by the American armed forces, while Taiwan Island is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, recognized by the Cairo Agreement of December 1, 1943, of the three powers—the United States, the United Kingdom, and China; the U.S. government thereby interfered in China's internal affairs. B, the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet blockades the coast of Taiwan Island with hostile intentions, that is, to prevent the armed forces and authorities of the People's Republic of China from entering the island—hereafter, the General Assembly hereby requests the Security Council to take the necessary steps to immediately stop the U.S. aggression against China."

The Political Committee listened attentively to the speech of Vyshinsky, head of the Soviet delegation.

The U.S. representative Dulles then spoke, repeating old tunes, saying that the U.S. has no territorial demands on China, that the U.S. is a "friend" of China, etc. He attempted to justify the U.S. occupation of Taiwan by claiming the necessity of protecting the flank of the U.S. military fighting in Korea. Dulles cited U.S. President Truman's statement of June 27 of this year, in which Truman insisted that the occupation of Taiwan by the Chinese People's Liberation Army would constitute a threat to the Pacific region. Dulles then asserted that Taiwan Island was supposedly in the process of separating from Japan, and the U.S. had a legitimate right to express its opinion in deciding the status of the island. However, everyone knows that the question of Taiwan belonging to China was already resolved by the Cairo Agreement and the Potsdam Agreement of the three powers.

Dulles also attempted to quibble over the U.S. Air Force's aggressive actions against China, saying that the weather conditions in Korea were very bad, and that in most cases, U.S. aircraft only crossed the Chinese border for "reconnaissance" purposes, and that when bombing the Yalu River Bridge, which separates the territories of China and Korea, U.S. bombs only "accidentally" fell on Chinese territory, etc.

Dulles stated that he reserved the right to give a more detailed reply to Vyshinsky's statement after "studying" it.

The Australian representative then spoke, proposing that the Political Committee not convene a meeting on the afternoon of November 27, because a meeting of the Security Council discussing the same issue must be held at the same time.

Vyshinsky supported the proposal of the Australian representative. At the same time, Vyshinsky gave a brief reply to Dulles's statement and declared that he reserved the right to answer the U.S. representative's statement in more detail when discussing this issue later.

Vyshinsky said: Dulles said that if U.S. aircraft violated Chinese airspace, then this was only for reconnaissance purposes. … But, can reconnaissance purposes be a reason for violating the territorial integrity of another country? Dulles made such a statement, which already admits that the following assertion is true: these violations—violations of the territorial integrity of the Chinese people, violations of the sovereignty of the Chinese people—have already occurred. Dulles further said: If there really were some such violations, then it was only the bridges that supposedly had "Communist armed forces" on them that were bombed. But strangely enough, Dulles forgot or avoided the details of certain bombing operations. For example, in many cases, reconnaissance flights later turned into bombing of villages and towns. On August 29, four U.S. aircraft conducted reconnaissance over Lagu Shao in Kuandian County, and then flew to Changdian River Estuary in the same county, strafing several fishing boats, and later appeared over the Gulouzi area northeast of Andong, strafing fishing boats. All these incursions caused casualties among Chinese residents. On September 22, U.S. aircraft bombed Andong again, damaging or destroying more than 300 houses; the third time was on November 9—U.S. aircraft dropped bombs at Changdian River Estuary in Kuandian County, destroying or damaging more than 500 houses.

Vyshinsky continued, Dulles made it sound as if it was only the bridges with "Communist armed forces" on them that were bombed. But you won't find a house on a bridge, let alone 500 houses. There is no airport on the bridge that U.S. military aircraft bombed. You won't find a train station on the bridge that they bombed either. But, the main problem is: as Dulles himself admitted, all these bombing incidents occurred on Chinese territory. What would Mr. Dulles say if the Chinese started bombing U.S. territory? He would probably be here, as the saying goes, yelling and screaming. We are not yelling and screaming, we are only saying: "American gentlemen, stop doing this, stop violating international law and principles! Stop violating the inviolability of China and its political independence!"

The meeting then adjourned.

　　联大政委会开始讨论控诉美国侵略中国案
    维辛斯基列举事实指控美国罪行
    要求安理会采必要步骤立即停止美国的侵略
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社纽约二十八日讯：前已报道，联合国大会政治委员会已开始讨论《苏联控诉美国侵略中国案》的问题，这是在苏联代表团提议下列入联合国大会议程的。在前次会议中，尽管有美国集团代表团的反对，但政治委员会仍然以多数票决定邀请中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表出席政治委员会会议参加《苏联控诉美国侵略中国》案的讨论。目前讨论的问题的性质和中华人民共和国中央人民政府代表团的到会，不仅使联合国组织的人士，而且也使联合国组织以外的人士特别关注。政治委员会的会议在拥挤的大厅中开始。政治委员会主席在宣布会议开始时，通知会议他已接到中华人民共和国中央人民政府授权已在联合国的、以伍修权为首的代表团参加上述问题的讨论的电报。在会议过程中，伍修权及其随员在桌前就坐。苏联代表团团长维辛斯基代表苏联代表团，向中国代表团致意，并表示希望他们的工作成功。维辛斯基在会上发表演说，阐述当前讨论的问题的实质。他的演说占了委员会上午会议的大部分时间，听众非常注意地倾听他的讲演。维辛斯基在开头就提醒委员会说：一九五○年六月二十七日美国总统正式下令美国第七舰队，对中国的台湾岛采取暴力行动。大家都知道，根据这项命令，美国海军已被派前往台湾海岸，对该岛实行海上封锁，并且在台湾海峡巡逻。从此以后，台湾各港口就变成了美国海军的基地，而不久之后美国空军连同其人员也调到了台湾。维辛斯基说：美国军队就这样蹂躏了国际公法的一切标准与原则，而完全非法地占领了台湾岛及其领海像驻扎在被征服的地区一样地驻扎在台湾地区，驻扎在这个中国的岛屿上。维辛斯基根据开罗与波茨坦协定说明台湾是中国的领土，并且提醒政治委员会台湾历代以来就属于中国。他着重指出：台湾是中国不可转让的领土，是中国不可分割的一部分。他并追述说：美国官方代表杜鲁门与艾奇逊在今年初曾一再声言美国将不干涉台湾的事务，并一般不干涉中国内政。美国国务院后来在一九五○年二月九日的正式声明，也曾谈到这一点。维辛斯基在政治委员会会议上当场宣读了这一声明的原文。维辛斯基指出：然而，仅管有这一切声明，美国政府却公然违背了它对台湾的义务，攫夺了这个岛屿，并派军队加以占领，因而破坏了中国领土的完整，横暴地蹂躏了国际法的基本标准和联合国宪章的原则。维辛斯基提醒政治委员会注意美国总统杜鲁门在对美国第七舰队发布命令时所作的声明，及后来美国武装部队对台湾的行动，并证明美国政府在对中国的关系上，已走上了以最残暴的武力方式实施武力政策的道路。他着重指出：目前，像总务委员会与大会全体会议讨论关于把所谓“福摩萨问题”列入大会议程的问题时所表现出来的那样，美国统治集团是意图假借联合国的招牌、旗帜与名义，来掩饰它自己对中国的台湾岛的扩张行为，正像他们在朝鲜所作的那样。维辛斯基把美国对中国的行为称之为显然的侵略行为，其目的就在支持已经破产了的、已被中国人民推翻了的国民党集团进行反对中国人民唯一合法的中国政府——中华人民共和国中央人民政府的斗争。维辛斯基详细追述美国干涉中国的历史，并指出：美国政府不仅继续干涉中国的内政，而且还在这个斗争中公开使用自己的军队。维辛斯基说：这件事情本身就证明了美国政府武装侵略中国的这一事实，证明了苏联对美国统治集团这类非法行动的控诉是正确的。维辛斯基强调称：美国对中国的侵略追求着深远的目的，其中之一便是要避免国民党集团被逐出其最后的巢穴台湾岛，并从而给美国保持一种可能性，使它能利用这个岛屿作为美国进一步侵略中国及侵略远东的军事基地。维辛斯基在其演说中证明了美国官方人士的解释是毫无根据的，是伪善和虚妄的，这些官员硬说这些侵略行动是因为美国在朝鲜进行战争而必须采取的，企图多少对世界舆论掩盖美国侵略中国的事实。维辛斯基说，美国统治集团对于美国侵略中国的行动的这种解释，正是承认自己的侵略而同时又伪造事实，歪曲事情的真相，因为朝鲜的军事行动正是美国干涉者所发动的。维辛斯基要政治委员会注意一些事实与文件，接着令人信服地证明了：美国在台湾地区对中国的侵略行动，是事先有充分而良好的准备的。他并着重指出：美国不仅在台湾侵略中国。而且，大家都知道，自今年夏末以来的几个月中，美国军用飞机已在满洲与朝鲜边境地区连续侵犯中国领空，轰炸并扫射中国领土，杀害中国许多人的生命，给中国造成了巨大的物质损失，并引起了中国政府及中国人民一再的抗议与愤慨。维辛斯基提醒政治委员会注意中华人民共和国外交部今年十一月十一日关于美国统治集团对中国的非法行动所发表的声明。维辛斯基说：美国统治集团对中国人民的民主力量及其民族解放斗争的仇恨，是大家所深知的，而且是有了长久的历史的；他举出自外国侵略者武装镇压名为“义和团运动”的中国人民起义以来的美国武装干涉中国内政的许多事实。
    维辛斯基进一步说：当一国——联合国会员国（在我们所谈的情况下就是美国）占领了另一主权国——联合国会员国的一部分领土，破坏其领土完整，干涉其内政，使用自己的军队参加其实已以中国人民的完全胜利而结束了的内战之时，联合国组织决不能听任这种情况存在。
    维辛斯基指出，联合国鼓励美国对于这一小群在美国卵翼下，和美国军队保护下藏在台湾，反对中华人民共和国人民政府的乱党和阴谋家的行动是不合适的。
    维辛斯基在演说结束时宣读苏联代表团提出的关于讨论中的问题的提案如下：
    “苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟对美利坚合众国侵略中国的控诉。
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟
    提案
    在审议了美国侵略中国的问题、听取了中华人民共和国代表团关于这个问题的声明和美国代表团的解释以后，在讨论美国海、空部队侵犯中国领土完整及其边界的事实——这些事实表现在：甲、美国武装部队入侵台湾岛，而台湾岛乃是中国领土的不可分割的一部分，一九四三年十二月一日的三强——美国、英国和中国——的开罗协定已予承认；美国政府因而干涉了中国内政。乙、美国海军第七舰队封锁台湾岛海岸，怀有敌意的目的，即不让中华人民共和国的军队和当局进入该岛——以后，大会兹特要求安全理事会采取必要步骤，俾使美国对中国的侵略立即停止。”
    政治委员会聚精会神地倾听了苏联代表团团长维辛斯基的演说。
    美国代表杜勒斯接着发言，他重弹旧调，说美国对中国没有领土的要求，说美国是中国的“友人”等等。他企图用保护在朝鲜作战美军之侧翼的必要性来为美国占领台湾辩护。杜勒斯引证美国总统杜鲁门本年六月二十七日的声明，杜鲁门在这个声明中硬说中国人民解放军部队的占领台湾会构成对太平洋地区的威胁。杜勒斯接着断言，台湾岛据说正在脱离日本的过程中，美国在决定该岛的地位上有表示意见的合法权利。然而大家都知道，台湾属于中国的问题早已由三强开罗协定和波茨坦协定解决了。
    杜勒斯并企图为美国空军对中国的侵略行动狡辩，说什么朝鲜的气象情况很恶劣，又说什么美国飞机在大多数情形之下只是为了“侦察”目的才越过中国边境，并且在轰炸分隔中朝两国领土的鸭绿江大桥时，美国炸弹只是“偶然地”掉在中国的领土上等等。
    杜勒斯声明保留在“研究”了维辛斯基的声明之后再对这一声明作更详细的答复的权利。
    澳大利亚代表继起发言，他提议政治委员会在十一月二十七日下午不必召开会议，因为安全理事会讨论同样问题的会议必须在同一时间举行。
    维辛斯基支持澳大利亚代表的提议。同时维辛斯基对于杜勒斯的声明简单地作了答复，并且声明保留在以后讨论这个问题时再更详细地回答美国代表的说法的权利。
    维辛斯基说：杜勒斯说，如果有美国飞机侵犯中国领空的情事发生的话，那么，这样做也只是为的侦察的目的。……但是，难道侦察的目的就可以作为侵犯另一国领土完整的理由吗？杜勒斯发表这样的声明，就已经承认了下面的断语是真实的：这些侵犯情事——侵犯中国人民的领土完整的情事，侵犯中国人民的主权的情事已经发生。杜勒斯进一步说：假使真的有这样一些侵犯情事发生的话，那么，也只是轰炸那些据说上面有“共产党武装部队”的桥梁。但是很奇怪的，杜勒斯忘记了或者是避开了某些轰炸行动的详情。例如，在许多情形下侦察飞行到后来竟变成了轰炸乡村和城镇。在八月二十九日，四架美国飞机在宽甸县属的拉古哨地方上空进行侦察，继即飞向同一县份的长甸河口，扫射数艘渔船，以后又出现安东东北的古楼子地区上空，扫射渔船。所有的这些侵袭都在中国居民中造成伤亡。九月二十二日，美国飞机又轰炸安东，损坏或炸毁了约三百多间房屋；第三次是在十一月九日——美国飞机在宽甸县长甸河口投弹，炸毁或损坏五百多栋房屋。
    维辛斯基继续说，杜勒斯把这件事情说成是好像只是上面有“共产党武装部队”的桥梁遭受轰炸。但是桥上是不会找到一间房屋的，更不要说五百间房屋了。桥上并没有美国军用飞机轰炸过的飞机场。桥上也找不到它们轰炸过的火车站。但是，主要问题是：如杜勒斯自己承认的那样，所有这些轰炸事件都发生在中国领土上。如果中国人开始轰炸美国领土的话，杜勒斯先生将说些什么呢？他大概会在这里，如俗话所说的，大喊大叫吧。我们没有大喊大叫，我们只说：“美国先生们，停止这样做，停止违犯国际法和原则！停止侵犯中国的不可侵犯性以及它的政治独立！”
    会议随后即告休会。
