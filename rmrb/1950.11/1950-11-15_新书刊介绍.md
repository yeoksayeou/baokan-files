　　New Book and Periodical Introductions
            Introducing "The Further Intensification of the General Crisis of Capitalism"
    This book is written by Leontiev, translated by Zhang Menghui, and published by Sanlian Bookstore. The book analyzes the further sharpening of the general crisis of capitalism in light of the current situation; it explains the aggressive nature of imperialism, especially American imperialism, as well as the increasing contradictions and intensifying corruption within the imperialist camp. At the same time, the author points out that the Soviet Union's victory over fascist Germany, the victory of the people's democratic system in Eastern Europe, the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, and the upsurge of the colonial national liberation movement have greatly strengthened the forces of the peace and democracy camp. No matter how mad American imperialism is, the power of the people will surely defeat it and eliminate it. In today's surging tide of resisting America and aiding Korea, this book can help us further understand American imperialism. Each copy is priced at three thousand two hundred yuan.
