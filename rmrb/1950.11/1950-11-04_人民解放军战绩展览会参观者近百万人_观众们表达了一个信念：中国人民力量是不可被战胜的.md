Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The Chinese People's Liberation Army Achievements Exhibition, which opened in the capital on October 2nd, has been warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in Beijing. As of the 31st of last month, the number of visitors reached 997,700. Audiences wrote many comments in the opinion book, expressing the same belief: the power of the People's China is invincible. A student from Beijing Sixth Municipal Middle School wrote: "If the American aggressors dare to invade us, they will perish under the counterattack of the Chinese people!" The writer Lao She wrote: "I hope that those who wield pens will also learn the loyalty and bravery of those who wield guns!"

　　Combat heroes attending the National Conference of Combat Heroes visited the exhibition to relive their glorious combat history. This further strengthened their determination to build a strong national defense force to defend the motherland and oppose American aggressors. Combat hero Liu Meicun wrote: "I will always hold my gun tightly to defend the victory of the people." Many other combat heroes from the army, navy, and air force wrote down a common will in different words: to fight to defend the people's motherland.

　　Due to the masses' requests to extend the exhibition time, it has been decided that the Cultural Relics Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government will continue to run the exhibition until the end of this month; all exhibition content will be compiled into a picture album by the General Administration of Publications.

　　人民解放军战绩展览会参观者近百万人
    观众们表达了一个信念：
    中国人民力量是不可被战胜的
    【新华社三日讯】自十月二日起在首都举行的中国人民解放军战绩展览会深受北京各界人民的欢迎，截至上月三十一日的统计，参观人数达九十九万七千七百余人。观众们在意见簿上写下了很多意见，这些意见表达了同一个信念：人民中国的力量是不可被战胜的。北京市立第六中学的一位学生这样写着：“美国侵略者如果胆敢侵略我们，它就要在中国人民的反击下灭亡！”作家老舍写着：“我愿拿笔杆的人也要学习拿枪杆的人的忠勇！”
    出席全国战斗英雄代表会议的战斗英雄们，曾经到展览会重温他们光辉的战斗史迹。从而更加强了他们建设强大国防军捍卫祖国、反对美国侵略者的决心。战斗英雄刘梅村写道：“我要永远握紧枪杆，保卫人民的胜利。”其他陆海空军的很多战斗英雄们用不同的话句，写下了这样一个共同的意志，为保卫人民祖国而斗争。
    由于群众纷纷请求延长展览时间，因此决定由中央人民政府文化部文物局继续接办到本月底再结束；全部展览内容并将由出版总署编辑画册刊行。
