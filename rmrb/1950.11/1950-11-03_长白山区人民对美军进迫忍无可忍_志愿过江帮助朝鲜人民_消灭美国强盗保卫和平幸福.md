Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd. The people in the Changbai Mountains on the right bank of the Yalu River can no longer tolerate the serious situation of the US imperialist invading army encroaching upon them, and they have expressed their willingness to cross the river to help the Korean people eliminate the American invading army.

In recent weeks, in many villages and settlements along the winding mountain range, groups of young farmers have been spontaneously gathering after finishing the autumn harvest, proposing to directly assist the Korean People's Army with various practical actions. They stated: The flames of American aggression have already burned to our doorstep, American planes have repeatedly strafed our Chinese compatriots, and our peaceful and happy lives have been disrupted. The fundamental way to defend our country and protect our homes is to cross the river to help the Korean people eliminate the American robbers.

In the Linjiang area, which experienced four heroic defense battles during the Liberation War, many farmers have spontaneously launched signature campaigns to express their willingness to join the Korean People's Army or serve in battlefield support roles. Several car drivers in the Linjiang urban area have also expressed their willingness to participate in the transportation work of the Korean People's Army. Many tailors have also expressed their willingness to serve the Korean People's Army.

The people of Changbai County, who live in the high mountains and dangerous ridges all year round, are now very concerned about the situation in Korea. Many people are spreading the word that the aggressive atrocities of the United States can no longer be tolerated. Young people are making appointments with each other, preparing to go to Korea to join the People's Army. Korean youths in the Badaogou area have even submitted their own lists, resolutely demanding to return to their country to kill the enemy.

In Fusong and Jingyu, which were once old base areas of the Anti-Japanese United Army, the sentiment of resisting America and aiding Korea is rising daily. Many women are urging their husbands and brothers to quickly finish harvesting the crops and prepare to go to aid the Korean People's Army. The people of Jian and other places are busy with the autumn harvest and threshing while actively strengthening their home defense work. Whether day or night, farmers armed with weapons are guarding their villages at all times. They say: "If American soldiers invade the border, we are ready to cross the river at any time to help the Korean people eliminate them."

　　长白山区人民对美军进迫忍无可忍
    志愿过江帮助朝鲜人民
    消灭美国强盗保卫和平幸福
    【新华社沈阳二日电】鸭绿江右岸长白山区的人民，对于美帝国主义侵略军队向他们进迫的严重情势现已不能忍受，纷纷表示他们要过江帮助朝鲜人民消灭美国侵略军队的志愿。
    数周来，蜿蜒千里的山麓地带，许多村屯于结束秋收后，经常有成群的青年农民自动集会，提出以各种实际行动直接援助朝鲜人民军。他们表示：美国的侵略战火已烧到了大门边，美国飞机多次扫射了中国的同胞，咱们的和平幸福生活已经被破坏了，只有过江去帮助朝鲜人民消灭美国强盗，才是卫国保家的根本办法。
    在解放战争中经历了四次英雄保卫战的临江地区，许多农民已经自动发起签名运动表示自己要前往参加朝鲜人民军或担任战地勤务事宜的志愿。临江城区的若干汽车司机亦表示愿意参加朝鲜人民军的运输工作。许多成衣匠也表示愿为朝鲜人民军服务。
    终年生活在高山险岭间的长白县人民，现在对朝鲜战局十分关心。许多人奔走相告，认为对美国的侵略暴行再也不能忍受了。青年人多相互约会，准备前往朝鲜参加人民军。八道沟区一带的朝鲜青年更提出了自己的名单，坚决要求回国杀敌。
    曾为抗日联军老根据地之一的抚松、靖宇等地，抗美援朝情绪日形高涨，许多妇女督促着自己的丈夫和兄弟，赶快拉完庄稼，准备前往援助朝鲜人民军。辑安等地的人民则一面忙于秋收打场，一面积极加强保家工作。无论白天和夜晚，时刻有手执武器的农民守卫着自己的村庄，他们说：“如果美国兵侵犯到边境，我们随时都准备过江帮助朝鲜人民消灭他们。”
