The military thought of American and British imperialism, as part of the criminal ideology of American and British warmongers, inherits the odious characteristics of German fascist military doctrine, which was shamefully bankrupt in World War II. It is an extremely anti-people, adventurous, and misanthropic predatory ideology, aimed at seizing world hegemony, plundering, and bloody aggression.

To establish world hegemony, American and British imperialists, disregarding the lessons of history, are pursuing a policy of launching new wars. Like the fascist aggressors, the American and British bloc is preparing for new wars, which is manifested in all aspects of activity - military strategic measures, political oppression and intimidation, economic expansion and enslavement of the people, ideological deception of the masses and strengthening reaction. The desperate warmongers have turned to direct acts of aggression. The American bandit-like intervention in Korea and the attempts by American imperialists to violate the territorial integrity and inviolability of the People's Republic of China are proof of this.

American and British imperialists use all their ideological arsenal to justify their criminal policy of launching a third world war. The increasingly decadent military thought of American and British imperialism serves these purposes.

Encouraging predatory wars and justifying the arms race

One of the characteristics of the military thought of American and British warmongers is a clear intention to conceal the true causes of imperialist wars in the "works" published by theorists and sociologists.

In striving to establish an "ideological foundation" suitable for the criminal launching of new wars, American and British imperialist theorists try in every possible way to conceal these iron facts: war is an inevitable companion of capitalism, and imperialist war arises from the very nature of imperialism as monopoly capitalism. They talk a lot about how the causes of all wars in human history, including imperialist wars, should be found in the biological "human nature," in some kind of innate bellicosity of mankind.

American and British military thought does everything possible to encourage predatory aggressive wars and to justify new wars. American and British military theorists shamelessly assert that war is a more natural and normal state than peace. In manufacturing orders for their own Wall Street masters, the scientific lackeys of the American and British warmongers attempt to portray war as the highest virtue. The American imperialist military theorists and sociologists describe the mad arms race and the violent militarization of all aspects of life in the United States as the "dynamics of society."

In exposing the military policies and thinking of the American and British warmongers in his speech "Stopping the Threat of New War and Strengthening World Peace and Security" at the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, Comrade Vyshinsky pointed out that for the past several years, the countries of the North Atlantic bloc have intensified propaganda to create world public opinion favorable to a new war. Vyshinsky pointed out that this propaganda has not only not subsided but is also intensifying under various pretexts, one of the purposes of which is to justify the rapid arms race (including atomic weapons). Vyshinsky pointed out that responsible American politicians and political commentators such as Bradley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Johnson, former Secretary of Defense, Matthews of the Navy, and General MacArthur are among the rabid warmongers of the Churchill and Dulles type who are now conducting criminal propaganda. Superstitious misanthropic racial doctrines, the foolish notion that the Anglo-Saxon race is superior to all nations on earth and its "moral" right to world domination, are based on American and British military thought, as well as on all other forms of thought of American and British warmongers. American and British military theorists, together with all ideological running dogs of the new ambitious individuals coveting world hegemony, copied the racist propaganda of their predecessors, the Hitlerites, and tried to "prove" that English-speaking people have the mission of ruling the world, and that other nations should submit to them obediently. As early as March 13, 1946, in his "Talk with a 'Pravda' Correspondent on Churchill's Speech," Stalin gave a thorough portrayal of Anglo-Saxon racism and one of its most ardent propagandists, the die-hard warmonger Churchill. Comrade Stalin said: "The German racial theory led Hitler and his associates to the conclusion that the Germans, as the only most valuable nation, should rule other nations. The British racial theory leads Mr. Churchill and his associates to the conclusion that the English-speaking nations, as the only most valuable nations, should rule the rest of the nations in the world. In essence, Churchill and his partners in Britain and the United States are presenting something like an ultimatum to the non-English-speaking nations: if you are willing to recognize our rule, then everything will be fine; otherwise, war is inevitable. However, nations have shed blood in five years of brutal war for the freedom and independence of their own countries, not to replace the rule of the Hitlers with the rule of Churchills. Therefore, it is entirely believable that the nations that do not speak English but constitute the majority of the world's population will not agree to be enslaved again."

Supporting the doctrine of American superiority by deceiving the people with "cosmopolitanism"

To support their notorious doctrine of American superiority, the military theorists and all other ideological running dogs of American imperialists spare no effort to advertise the so-called "American way of life." As is well known, in fact, this notorious "American way of life" is the brutal suppression of the American democratic progressive movement, extreme racial discrimination against blacks, and concentration camps and prisons for communists and members of other progressive organizations. "American way of life" - this is a large number of unemployed people, the ever-worsening impoverishment of the working masses, and at the same time the astonishing increase in the profits of a small group of monopoly capitalists.

The racist preachings of a group of military theorists of American and British imperialists are combined with the preachings of cosmopolitanism – the official ideology of American and British imperialism. The thinkers of the American and British warmongers painstakingly try to "prove" that the principle of national sovereignty seems to have become obsolete, and that it is now time to establish a "world federation" and a "world government," needless to say, under the aegis of the United States. One of the most rabid cosmopolitans of this kind in Britain, the radical reactionary in philosophy, Russell, declared in stating the intentions of the British and American imperialists: "We should establish a world state, or perish." American and British imperialist thinkers, together with the philosophical running dogs of imperialism in the right-wing socialist camp, attempt to disarm the people of all countries spiritually with the teachings of cosmopolitanism, so as to make them easy victims of American bloody aggression.

In exposing the reactionary significance and mission of the hypocritical cosmopolitan rhetoric of American and British imperialists, Zhdanov pointed out: "...the idea of ​​'world government' is not only used as a means of suppressing and spiritually disarming those nations who insist on their independence and do not want to be infringed upon by American imperialism, but also as a special anti-Soviet slogan, while the Soviet Union is constantly and consistently adhering to the principles of true equality and complete sovereignty of all nations, large and small."

Shouting to use devastating weapons regardless of any human moral standards

The military thought of American and British imperialists is a predatory and destructive war ideology. US Secretary of the Navy Matthews recently declared in a speech in Boston that the United States should assume the role of "initiator of aggressive war" under the banner of "fighting for peace." Reflecting the cannibalistic appetites of American and British warmongers, American and British military thought promotes the legitimacy of unlimited use of barbaric weapons of mass destruction against peaceful residents - atomic bombs and bacteriological and chemical weapons - to conduct destructive wars. No less than their predecessors, the treacherous Japanese and German ambitious individuals coveting world hegemony, American and British imperialists shamelessly openly stated that they would conduct wars of mass destruction of peaceful residents using terrible weapons without declaration.

The statement made in June 1950 by Fenton Vandenberg, the then Chief of Staff of the US Air Force - one of the declarers of the so-called "ultra-lightning atomic war" - clearly demonstrated this characteristic. This visionary declared: "If World War III breaks out, the war will begin with an intense period of atomic bombing. The coming war will break out without prior declaration."

In addition to the "ultra-lightning atomic war" propaganda, the United States is also doing everything possible to promote the theory of bacteriological and chemical warfare (also "ultra-lightning"). The manufacturers of these cannibalistic theories believe that the large-scale use of bacteriological and chemical weapons is the most effective means of carrying out aggression. This "theory" is becoming more and more openly recognized in imperialist America. For example, former US Secretary of the Army Johnson, in his US Army Department's business report to Truman in the second half of 1949, directly declared that the United States "continues to study and develop bacteriological warfare weapons." It is a well-known fact that American cannibals are even using people, especially Canadian Eskimos, to test bacteriological weapons.

In order to continue the dark deeds of their Japanese predecessors in preparing for bacteriological warfare, American imperialists are defending Japanese war criminals, headed by Emperor Hirohito, who were fully exposed in the Khabarovsk trials for preparing to use bacteriological warfare for mass extermination of people. This is not accidental.

American and British warmongers emphasize the effectiveness of destructive weapons in war and disregard any humanitarian standards. With criminal cynicism, they despise the basic standards of international law and the basic principles of human morality. In particular, the statement by Mr. Symington, chairman of the so-called US National Security Resources Committee, proves this point. In response to the statement by American progressives that the use of atomic weapons is immoral, he ridiculously and shamelessly said: "I have never thought that military issues have anything to do with morality in my life." Just like the military thinking of Hitler's Germany at that time, American and British military theorists and politicians insist that the "outdated rules" that prohibit the use of poison gas and bacteriological weapons under the current conditions of warfare are "unreasonable." They asserted that these methods are effective and that any humanitarian and moral principles should be abandoned.

Overestimating their own economic capabilities and underestimating the strength of the democratic camp

From the point of view of these cannibals, the people's demand to ban barbaric tools of aggression - atomic bombs - is "unreasonable." The steady growth of the struggle for the prohibition of atomic weapons encouraged by the great Soviet Union by all progressive humanity (which is manifested in the mass movement to collect signatures for the Stockholm Declaration of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace launched all over the world) has aroused vicious rage and madness in the camp of imperialist warmongers and their scientific running dogs.

The preachings of "ultra-lightning" atomic, bacteriological, and chemical warfare also reflect the adventurism of American and British military thought and military science. When launching criminal wars to establish their own world hegemony, American and British imperialists cannot count on having spiritual superiority in such wars. Because of this, they bet on the use of atomic bombs and bacteriological and chemical offensive weapons, calculating that these weapons could enable them to gain world hegemony. In particular, the following statement by one of the die-hard warmongers, US Secretary of State Acheson, can serve as proof. He said: "I think that with the help of modern weapons and inventions, we can do what the Roman Empire did in a hundred years. It depends...on the superiority of our weapons."

Exaggerating the significance of military plans and military technology, overestimating their own economic capabilities, and underestimating the strength and prestige of the anti-imperialist democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union - these are the fundamental diseases of the military thought and military science of American and British imperialists, and they also prove the adventurousness of their military doctrine again. This adventurism in American and British military thought is entirely determined by the predatory and adventurous policies of American and British warmongers.

Due to the well-known TASS report on the Soviet Union's possession of atomic weapons secrets, the US atomic blackmail policy was completely bankrupt. American military thinkers such as Bradley and Eisenhower (who were recently famous for advocating "ultra-lightning" warfare with atomic bombs, guided-missile launchers, and other barbaric tools of destruction) now have to talk about the need to establish a large army as the basis of "America's healthy strategic concept."

The steady growth of the forces of the peace camp will inevitably lead to the failure of the warmongers' plans

The anti-people, predatory, and adventurous nature of American and British military thought also determines the nature of soldier education and training in the armies of the American and British groups. The entire troop coaching system in the US army and the armies of the European Marshallized countries is designed to turn soldiers into blind tools of imperialism and appendages of technology. American and British imperialists use the spirit of misanthropy, the ideas and morals of beasts, to educate their soldiers and officers, and reduce the lowly criminal instincts among them.

American imperialists spare no effort to instill this criminal and despicable idea into the minds of their soldiers: they are a nation that has the mission of exercising "spiritual rule" over the world and consolidating the rule of American capital in the world by armed forces. Truman declared in a speech on the so-called "Army Day": "We should take on the leadership and take on the responsibility for the world. Our foreign policy should be the policy of the world."

The filthy slander of the Soviet Union occupies a dominant position in the ideological education of American and British soldiers. American and British imperialists spare no effort to discredit the peace-loving policies of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

As a result of all this despicable ideological education, it can be clearly seen in the faces of American soldiers and officers who are carrying out bloody and bandit-like intervention against the Korean people. Like those Hitler heroes, American bandits plunder, loot peaceful residents, rape women, barbarically bomb peaceful cities and villages, and cruelly massacre innocent old people, women, and children. The notorious MacArthur "Sam" is a clear embodiment of the abominable face of the American rogues fighting against the heroic Korean people. The following eloquent fact proves the "moral" principles of this bloody executioner: after visiting Incheon, Korea, with no title, and seeing the corpses of massacred Korean citizens, MacArthur shouted: "This pleases my old eyes."

This is the military thought of American and British imperialism and the American and British soldiers who are educated in this spirit of bloody aggression.

The people of the world condemn the criminal military policies and thinking of American and British imperialists. The Soviet Union and all advanced humanity encouraged by the great standard-bearer of peace, Comrade Stalin, are actively engaged in the struggle against the bloody plans of the American and British warmongers and for lasting democratic peace throughout the world. The steady growth of the powerful camp of peace supporters headed by the Soviet Union - the indestructible fortress of peace and people's security - is the guarantee that the military policies and thinking of American and British warmongers will suffer complete failure.

### 美帝国主义者的军事思想

　　美帝国主义者的军事思想
    苏联陆军少将  彼得罗夫
    作为美英战争贩子全部犯罪思想组成部分的美英帝国主义的军事思想，继承了在第二次世界大战中已宣告可耻破产的德国法西斯军事学说的可恶的特色。这是极端反人民的、冒险主义的、仇恨人类的掠夺思想，旨在攫取世界霸权的、强夺和血腥侵略的思想。
    美英帝国主义者为了建立世界霸权，不顾历史的教训，实行发动新战争的政策。美英集团也同法西斯侵略者一样，进行新战争的准备工作，这同时表现在各方面的活动上——军事战略措施，政治压迫和威吓讹诈，经济扩张和奴役人民，思想上愚弄群众和加强反动，孤注一掷的战争贩子已转入直接侵略的行动。美国在朝鲜进行强盗式的干涉行为，美国帝国主义者企图侵犯中华人民共和国领土的完整和不可侵犯性，就是证明。
    美英帝国主义者运用自己的一切思想武库来为自己发动第三次世界大战的罪恶政策辩解。日益堕落的美英帝国主义的军事思想，便为这些目的而服务。
    鼓励掠夺性的侵略战争为疯狂的军备竞赛辩护
    在已出版的理论家和社会学家的“著作”中，明白表现出一种意向，企图把产生帝国主义战争的真正原因掩盖起来，这种意向便是美英战争贩子军事思想的特点之一。
    在努力建立适合于罪恶地发动新战争的“思想基础”时，美英帝国主义的理论家们千方百计地竭力隐蔽这些铁的事实：战争是资本主义不可避免的伴侣，帝国主义战争产生于作为垄断资本主义的帝国主义本身的特性。他们高谈阔论说什么人类历史上发生的一切战争的原因，帝国主义战争的原因也在内，应该从生物学上“人类天性”的特质中，从什么人类生来俱有的好斗性中去寻找。
    美英军事思想千方百计地鼓励掠夺性的侵略战争，为新战争辩护。美英军事理论家们无耻地武断说，战争比和平是更自然而正常的状态。在制造他们自己的华尔街主子的订货时，美英战争贩子的科学伙计们便企图把战争描述为最高的善行美德。美国正在进行疯狂的军备竞赛和生活各方面的猛烈的军国主义化，美国帝国主义的军事理论家和社会学家却把这些说成“社会的动力”。
    维辛斯基同志此次在联合国第五届大会上发表“制止新战争威胁，巩固世界和平与安全”的演说，在揭露美英战争贩子的军事政策和思想时，他指出，在北大西洋集团国家中，加紧宣传，制造世界舆论，使它有利于新战争，这已非第一年了。维辛斯基指出，这种宣传不单没有平息，而且在各种各样的借口下还在日益加强，其中有一个目的便是为急速的军备（包括原子武器在内）竞赛辩解。维辛斯基指出，如参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷、前国防部长詹逊、海军部队马休斯、以及麦克阿瑟将军等这些美国负责的政治家与政论家，都属于现正进行罪恶宣传的邱吉尔、杜勒斯型的狂暴的战争贩子。迷信的仇恨人类的种族学说，盎格鲁撒克逊族比地球上一切民族优越及其对世界统治的“道义上的”权利等愚蠢学说，是建筑在美英军事思想的基础上的，也是建筑在美英战争贩子其他一切形式的思想的基础之上的。美英军事理论家和觊觎世界霸权的新野心家的所有思想走卒们一起，抄袭其前辈——希特勒分子——种族主义的宣传，力图“证明”操英语的人负有统治全世界的使命，其他各族人民则应俯首帖耳地服从他们。斯大林早在一九四六年三月十三日“与《真理报》记者关于邱吉尔演说的谈话”中，对盎格鲁撒克逊种族主义及其最热心的宣传者之一，顽固不化的战争贩子邱吉尔作了一个透彻的描画。斯大林同志说：“日耳曼种族学说，使希特勒及其伙伴得出一个结论，说日耳曼人是应该统治其他民族的唯一最有价值的民族。英国种族学说使邱吉尔先生及其伙伴得出一个结论，说操英语的民族是应该统治世界上其余民族的唯一最有价值的民族。按问题的本质来说，邱吉尔及其在英国和美国的伙伴，向不操英语的民族提出了类似哀的美敦书的东西：你们如愿意承认我们的统治，那末就百事大吉，否则，战争是不可避免的。可是，各民族在五年残酷的战争中流了血，是为了自己国家的自由和独立，而不是为了以邱吉尔之流的统治来代替希特勒之流的统治。因此，完全可以相信，不操英语但却组成世界上人口大多数的民族是不同意再受奴役的。”
    支持美国人优越的学说以“世界主义”欺骗人民
    美国帝国主义者的军事理论家以及一切其他思想走卒们，为了支持自己臭名远扬的美国人优越的学说，便千方百计地大作所谓“美国生活方式”的广告。如所周知，实际上这种臭名远扬的“美国生活方式”，也就是对美国民主进步运动的残酷镇压，对黑人极端的种族歧视，对共产党人以及其他进步组织成员的集中营和监狱。“美国生活方式”——这就是大批的失业者，劳动群众每况愈下的贫困化，同时一群为数极小的垄断资本家的利润却惊人的增高。
    美英帝国主义者一群军事理论家的种族主义的说教，是与世界主义——美英帝国主义官家的思想——的说教结合起来的。美英战争贩子的思想家们费尽心机来竭力“证明”，国家主权的原则好像已经陈腐了，现在已是成立“世界联邦”和“世界政府”的时候了，不消说，这要在美国庇护之下。英国这种狂暴的世界主义说教者之一、哲学中激烈的反动派拉特尔，在表明英美帝国主义者意向时宣称：“我们应该建立世界国家，或者是灭亡。”美英帝国主义者思想家们和帝国主义在右派社会党阵营中哲学方面的走狗们一起，力图以关于世界主义的说教在精神上解除各族人民的武装，好把他们作为美国血腥侵略的轻易牺牲品。
    日丹诺夫在揭露美英帝国主义者虚伪的世界主义的饰词之反动的意义和使命时指出：“……‘世界政府’的思想，不仅是用来充当镇压的手段，以使那些坚持自己的独立而不要美帝国主义加以侵害的各族人民在精神上解除武装，而且还可充当专门反苏的口号，而苏联是不停地始终坚持一切大小民族真正平等和主权完整的原则。”
    叫嚣使用毁灭性的武器不顾任何人类道德标准
    美英帝国主义者的军事思想，乃是一种掠夺性的毁灭性的战争思想。美国海军部长马休斯不久前在波士顿发表演说时，曾直截了当地宣称，美国应该承担起在“为和平而斗争”的旗帜下的“侵略战争首倡者”的角色。反映着美英战争贩子吃人的胃口，美英军事思想宣传无限制使用大规模毁灭和平居民的野蛮武器——原子弹与细菌、化学武器，进行毁灭性战争的合法性。美英帝国主义者也不亚于自己的前辈——背信弃义的德日两国觊觎世界霸权的野心家，竟无耻地公开说到，他们将不宣布而进行大规模使用可怕的武器以灭绝和平居民的战争。
    一九五○年六月美国报纸所发表现任美国空军参谋长范顿伯——所谓“超闪电原子战”的宣告者之一——的声明，极显明地表现了这方面的特征。这位狂想者宣称：“如果第三次世界大战爆发，战争便从激烈的原子轰炸时期开始。即将来临的战争将不经预先宣布而爆发。”
    美国除了“超闪电原子战”宣传而外，还千方百计地宣传细菌和化学战争（也是“超闪电”的）的理论。这些吃人理论的制造者认为大规模使用细菌和化学武器，是进行侵略的最有效的手段。这种“理论”在帝国主义的美国愈来愈受到公开的承认。例如，前美国陆军部长詹逊在其致杜鲁门的一九四九年下半年美国陆军部业务报告中，直截了当地宣称，合众国“继续研究和发展细菌战的武器”。美国吃人生番竟使用人，尤其是使用加拿大的爱斯基摩人来试验细菌武器，这是人所共知的事实。
    美国帝国主义者为要继续其日本先辈在准备细菌战方面的黑暗勾当，乃为已在伯力审讯中完全败露的以裕仁天皇为首的准备用细菌战来大规模灭绝人民的日本战犯辩护，并不是偶然的。
    美英战争贩子讲求战争中毁灭性武器的效力而不顾任何人道标准。他们以犯罪的犬儒主义，蔑视国际公法的基本标准、人类道德的基本原则。尤其是所谓美国全国安全资源委员会主席薛明顿的声明证明了这一点。他在回答美国进步人士关于使用原子武器为不道德之举的声明时，竟荒唐无耻地说道：“我有生以来从未想到军事问题与道德有何相干。”和当时希特勒德国的军事思想一模一样，美英军事理论家和政治家硬说，在目前进行战争的条件下，禁止使用毒瓦斯和细菌武器的“陈旧规则”，是“不合理的”。他们断言，这些方法是有效的，任何人道和任何道德原则都应该抛弃。
    过高估计自己经济能力过低估计民主阵营力量
    从这些吃人生番的观点看来，人民要求禁止野蛮的侵略工具——原子弹——是“不合理的”。伟大的苏联所鼓励的全体进步人类为禁止原子武器而进行的稳步增长的斗争（这表现在全世界各地展开的为世界拥护和平大会常设委员会斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名的群众性运动上），引起帝国主义战争贩子及其科学走狗的阵营中恶毒的暴怒和狂乱。
    “超闪电的”原子、细菌、化学战的说教，也反映着美英军事思想和军事科学的冒险主义。美英帝国主义者在为了建立自己的世界霸权而发动罪恶战争时，却不能指望着自己在这种战争中具有精神上的优越性。正因为如此，所以他们就在使用原子弹与细菌、化学的进攻武器上下了赌注，盘算着这些武器就可使他们获得世界霸权。尤其是顽固不化的战争贩子之一——美国国务卿艾奇逊的下列声明，可作为证明。他说：“我以为，凭借现代武器和发明的助力，我们可以作罗马帝国时代一百年间所作的那样。这取决……于我们武器的优越。”
    夸大军事计划和军事技术的意义，过高估计自己的经济能力，过低估计以苏联为首的反帝国主义的民主阵营的力量和威势——这些就是美英帝国主义者军事思想和军事科学的根本病害，而且也再度证明其军事学说的冒险性。美英军事思想上的这种冒险主义，全然决定于美英战争贩子的掠夺性的冒险政策。
    由于人所共知的塔斯社关于苏联握有原子武器秘密的报道，使美国原子讹诈政策遭到完全破产，布莱德雷与艾森豪威尔之类的美国军事思想家（他们不久前还是因主张以原子弹、定向投射器及其他野蛮的毁灭工具进行“超闪电”战而出名），现在已不得不说到必须建立庞大的陆军，作为“美国健康的战略观念”的基础了。
    和平阵营力量稳步增长战争贩子计划必然失败
    美英军事思想之反人民的、掠夺的、冒险的性质，也决定了美英集团的军队中士兵教育与训练的性质。美国军队以及欧洲马歇尔化国家的军队中整个部队的教练制度，都是打算把士兵变为帝国主义的盲目工具，变为技术的附属品。美英帝国主义者以仇恨人类的精神，以野兽的思想和道德精神，来教育自己的士兵和军官，在他们中间增减低级的犯罪的本能。
    美国帝国主义者用尽一切手段在自己士兵的意识中灌输这种犯罪的卑鄙思想：他们是负有对世界实行“精神统治”，并凭借武装力量巩固美国资本在全世界的统治这种使命的民族。杜鲁门在所谓“陆军节”发表演说中宣称：“我们应该承担起领导、承担起对世界的责任。我们的外交政策应该是全世界的政策。”
    对苏联的龌龊的诽谤，在美英士兵思想教育中占着主导地位。美英帝国主义者千方百计地极力诋毁苏联和人民民主国家的爱好和平政策。
    所有这一切卑劣的思想教育的结果，在对朝鲜人民进行血腥的强盗式的干涉的美国士兵和军官的面貌上，可以明白地看出来，美国强盗也和那些希特勒好汉们一样，掠夺、掳劫和平居民、强奸妇女，野蛮地轰炸和平城市乡村，残忍地屠杀无辜的老人、妇女、儿童。臭名远扬的麦克阿瑟“山姆”，便是对英勇的朝鲜人民交战的美国无赖汉这种可恶面貌的明白体现。下列雄辩的事实就证明了这位血腥的刽子手的“道德”原则，在访问无题朝鲜仁川后并见到被屠杀的朝鲜公民尸体后，麦克阿瑟大叫：“这使我老眼欣悦”。
    美英帝国主义的军事思想和以这种血腥侵略的精神教育成的美英军人，就是如此。
    世界各族人民都斥责美英帝国主义者罪恶的军事政策和思想。苏联和伟大的和平旗手斯大林同志所鼓励的一切先进人类，积极进行反对美英战争贩子的血腥计划和争取全世界持久民主和平的斗争。以苏联——不可摧毁的和平及人民安全的堡垒——为首的强大的和平拥护者阵营的稳步增长，便是将使美英战争贩子的军事政策和思想遭受完全失败的保证。
