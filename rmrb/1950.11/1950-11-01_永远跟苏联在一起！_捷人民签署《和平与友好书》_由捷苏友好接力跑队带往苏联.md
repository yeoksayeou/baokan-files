Participants will carry the original "Book of Peace and Friendship" to the Soviet border. Participants will run along two routes through the towns and cities of the Czechoslovak states. Tens of thousands of young men and women will participate in this relay race. In addition to this main relay race, a star-shaped relay race will also be held. This relay race will include the central areas of all districts in the country.
    Long banners were hung on the buildings around Peace Square, with the words: "Strive for Peace and Socialism with the Soviet Union," "Forever Be With the Soviet Union," "Glory to the Great Stalin - the Teacher of the World's Working People."
    Many representatives of the Czechoslovak public appeared on the solemnly decorated podium. Dozens of people arrived at the square on motorcycles, carrying letters from residents of various districts of Prague and the state to the Soviet Union. These letters were handed over to the runners participating in the main relay race. After a brief meeting, Pokorny, Vice Chairman of the National Sports Commission, handed the original "Book of Peace and Friendship" to Czechoslovak athletes - Miroslava, a record holder in gymnastics, Sbrihalova, and Bartosek, a record holder in swimming.
