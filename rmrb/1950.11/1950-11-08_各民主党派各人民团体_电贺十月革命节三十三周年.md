    China Association for Promoting Democracy Congratulatory Telegram
    [This Newspaper] The China Association for Promoting Democracy sent a telegram to Marshal Stalin, congratulating him on the Soviet October Revolution Day. The congratulatory telegram is as follows: To the Soviet Embassy in China, transferred to Marshal Stalin:
    The inspiration and positive influence that the great October Revolution has given to the people of the world is universally recognized. We Chinese people especially cannot forget the various friendly assistance that the Soviet government and the Soviet people have given to the Chinese revolution for more than 30 years. Today, the American imperialists are frantically carrying out aggression in our Taiwan and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, attempting to further invade our mainland. We, the entire Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, are determined to learn from the Soviet people's valuable experience in defending revolutionary achievements and eliminating aggressors, and give a powerful counterattack to the American imperialists' aggressive acts, defend our country, and defend world peace. On the occasion of the 33rd anniversary of the October Revolution, on behalf of all members of our association, I would like to pay tribute to the great revolutionary teacher Marshal Stalin and all the Soviet people.
