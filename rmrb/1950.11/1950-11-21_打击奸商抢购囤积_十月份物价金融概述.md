　　Cracking Down on Profiteers' Panic Buying and Hoarding
    ——An Overview of Prices and Finance in October

    In order to stabilize grain prices and appropriately reduce the scissors difference between industrial products and agricultural products, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government adjusted the listed prices of grain and cotton cloth in October; grain prices were raised, and cloth prices were slightly lowered. Based on the prices at the end of September, the national average price of coarse grains was raised by 7%, the price of rice in East China, Central South China, and other places was raised by 10%, and the price of wheat and flour, which had been low for a long time, was raised by 16%, and the price of cotton was raised by about 3%. The decrease in cloth prices was extremely small. For example, the price of 190 blue cloth in Beijing dropped from 430,000 yuan to 425,000 yuan, a decrease of only 1.2%. National prices rose slightly. According to the price index of 31 major commodities in six major cities compiled by the Ministry of Trade, it rose by 5.9% at the end of October compared with the end of September.

    The increase and decrease of various commodities varied, with grain rising more. For example, comparing October 31st with September 30th in Shanghai, grain increased by 12.3%, cotton yarn and cloth increased by 0.8%, and department store goods increased by 1.7%.

    The result of the price adjustment by the Central Ministry of Trade was to narrow the scissors difference between agricultural products and industrial products compared with the past, and it was supported by the broad masses of farmers. For example, a farmer in Hebei Province bought a bolt of "Five Blessings" cloth for 245,000 yuan at the Tianjin Zhongyuan Company. He walked out the door and said with satisfaction, "The price of cloth is right. A while ago, corn cost more than 600 yuan per jin, and 2.5 shi of corn could buy one bolt of cloth. Now the price of corn has risen, but the price of cloth is still the same, and 1.8 shi of corn can buy one bolt of cloth." The exchange ratio of cloth and rice in Tianjin, Shanghai, Beijing and other places is listed below:

    (Qingdao exchanges for corn, and Xi'an exchanges for wheat)

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Average in September　　　　　October 27th　　　Increase/Decrease % Compared September to October
　　Tianjin　　　　　　　　　　246.3 jin　　　　　　　223.8　　　　　　　　Decrease 9.1
　　Beijing　　　　　　　　　　233.2　　　　　　　　　214.2　　　　　　　　Decrease 8.1
　　Taiyuan　　　　　　　　　　304.2　　　　　　　　　247.8　　　　　　　　Decrease 18.5
　　Shanghai　　　　　　　　　172.6　　　　　　　　　174.1　　　　　　　　Increase 0.9
　　Qingdao　　　　　　　　　　349.3　　　　　　　　　219　　　　　　　　　Decrease 37.3
　　Jinan　　　　　　　　　　　310.4　　　　　　　　　246.9　　　　　　　　Decrease 20.5
　　Xuzhou　　　　　　　　　　354.2　　　　　　　　　282.4　　　　　　　　Decrease 20.3
　　Hankou　　　　　　　　　　326.4　　　　　　　　　262.5　　　　　　　　Decrease 19.6
　　Changsha　　　　　　　　　411.5　　　　　　　　　298.9　　　　　　　　Decrease 27.4
　　Xi'an　　　　　　　　　　　334.2　　　　　　　　　272.1　　　　　　　　Decrease 18.6
　　Chongqing　　　　　　　　379.4　　　　　　　　　353.5　　　　　　　　Decrease 6.8

    It can be seen from the above table that, except for Shanghai, the exchange figures in other markets have decreased significantly. On average, the 11 markets have decreased by 16.8% compared with September.

    In the process of the people's government actively adjusting prices, a few profiteers speculated and disrupted the market, mainly manifested in the surge in transaction volume of yarn and grain, and market prices higher than listed prices. After the price stabilization in March, there was a phenomenon of market prices being lower than listed prices. After the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government adjusted the listed prices of grain and yarn on October 12, market prices followed the rise in listed prices and were higher than listed prices. For example, on October 19, the listed price of flour in Shanghai was 71,000 yuan per bag, and the market price was 76,000 yuan, 7% higher than the listed price; the listed price of 20-count yarn was 6.05 million yuan, and the market price was 6.32 million yuan, 4.5% higher than the listed price.

    The recent phenomenon of a sharp increase in the transaction volume of yarn and cloth in major and medium-sized cities is abnormal. Taking Tianjin as an example, the transaction volume on September 30 this year was 284 pieces of yarn and 1,649 pieces of white cloth, and the transaction volume on October 23 was 479 pieces of yarn and 20,300 pieces of white cloth. Compared with September, yarn increased by 68%, and cloth increased by more than 11 times.

    Why did the transaction volume of yarn and cloth increase so much? On the one hand, autumn and winter are the peak sales season for yarn and cloth, and at the same time, this year's bumper harvest of grain has increased farmers' purchasing power. In addition, the panic buying and hoarding by profiteers is an important factor in the increased market transaction volume. According to investigations in Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing and other places, some merchants and citizens who do not normally deal in yarn and cloth have been found to purchase yarn and cloth. Shanghai Private Zhouji Cloth Factory went bankrupt due to hoarding yarn and cloth and poor capital turnover, issuing more than a dozen bad checks.

    In order to stabilize prices and combat speculation, the people's government has taken the following measures: First, it sells a large amount of materials to ensure the legitimate needs of producers and consumers, so that profiteers cannot manipulate the market. This can be seen from the fact that trade companies account for a large proportion of the recent transaction volume of major commodities such as grain, cotton yarn and cloth, coal, and edible salt. For example, the quantity of white cloth sold by Chongqing Trading Company accounted for 47% of the total market transaction volume on August 30, and it accounted for 100% on October 30. Private merchants hoard and refuse to sell, relying entirely on trade companies to supply market needs. On the 30th, Shanghai Grain Company sold 12,700 bags of flour, accounting for 99% of the total market transaction volume.

    Second, market transactions are managed to prevent speculation. In order to ensure the normal transaction of the market and prevent speculative hoarding activities by profiteers, various places have carried out management of the yarn and cloth market. On October 30, the Shanghai Administration for Industry and Commerce announced the rules for the management of the yarn and cloth market. The main contents are: 1. Centralize the transaction and registration of cotton yarn. Cotton yarn factories must concentrate all sales of yarn on the market and shall not directly transport and sell it to various places, and report the production, sales, and inventory figures of cotton yarn to the Administration for Industry and Commerce on a daily basis. 2. Cotton yarn merchants in the city must report the purchase, sales, and inventory figures to the Administration for Industry and Commerce on a daily basis. 2. Professional cotton yarn merchants in the city and replication factories that use cotton yarn as the main raw material must first have their purchases of one or more pieces of yarn reviewed and certified by the trade association, and approved by the Administration for Industry and Commerce before they can purchase yarn from the cotton yarn and cloth company or the market. 3. Private yarn storage may be applied for sale before November 15, 1950, and overdue storage will be treated as hoarding yarn. 4. Stop cotton yarn futures trading, and all transactions shall be settled in cash and in kind, and stack receipt transactions are strictly prohibited. 5. Those who violate any of the above rules shall be severely punished according to law. Jinan also implements on-site trading with certificates. The above measures can limit the speculative activities of private merchants.

    Speculation also occurred in the financial market, mainly manifested in the sharp rise in the price of gold and silver, and the increase in reselling and hoarding.

    In accordance with the provisions of the Common Program: "The purchase and sale of gold and silver shall be managed by the state bank," and "Those who engage in financial speculation and undermine the national financial cause shall be severely punished," the people's government arrested and punished those who resold gold and silver. On October 13, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau arrested Wu Shengcai, Xiong Fengxi, Han Bizhong, Wan Faxin, Ye Qiuping and other five criminals who were engaged in gold and silver trading, and seized 11 taels of gold, multiple pieces of gold jewelry, 31 U.S. dollars, 7 silver dollars, more than 1.8 million yuan in RMB, and gold model balance weights, etc., and dealt with them according to the severity of their circumstances. Among them, Ye Qiuping did not engage in black market trading. Her gold jewelry and RMB were returned and she was released. Wan Faxin was detained and released after education. Wu Shengcai and other three criminals repeatedly resold gold and silver and undermined government laws and regulations. They were detained by the court for 35 days in May this year and fined 3 million yuan, but they still refused to repent and have been sent to the people's court for punishment.

    The Beijing Municipal People's Court sentenced Cao Songting, Zhang Yufeng, and Du Jinsheng to fixed-term imprisonment for reselling gold. Cao Songting was sentenced to two years in prison and fined 15 million yuan, Zhang Yufeng was sentenced to one and a half years in prison, and Du Jinsheng was sentenced to one year in prison. The gold and cash resold were confiscated.

    When the trade company took the initiative to increase the listed price of grain, a few profiteers mistakenly estimated: "Prices are going to rise again." They attempted to take advantage of the opportunity of U.S. imperialism expanding its aggression and the enthusiastic participation of the people across the country in the Resist America, Aid Korea movement to raise prices and seek exorbitant profits. Therefore, they hoarded large quantities of the people's main necessities such as yarn, cloth, and grain, but this wishful thinking was wrong.

    Since the establishment of the Central People's Government, it has taken various measures, especially the implementation of national financial and economic unification in March this year, which ended the 12-year inflation and stabilized finance and prices. This shows that the strength of the Chinese people on the economic front is strong. This year's bumper harvest of grain and cotton has further strengthened our power to stabilize prices. The attempt of speculators to disrupt the market is bound to fail. As Vice Premier Chen Yun said in his article "The Situation of Fiscal and Economic Work in the Past Year of the People's Republic of China": "After March 1950, the nature of the domestic market has changed. From then on, the leadership of commercial speculative capital over the domestic market will never exist," "The unfortunate era when prices were often led by grain or yarn under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang is gone forever."

　　打击奸商抢购囤积
    ——十月份物价金融概述
    中央人民政府贸易部为了稳定粮价，适当地缩小工业品与农产品的剪刀差额，十月份主要调整粮食、棉布牌价；粮价调高，布价微降。以九月底的价格为基准，全国粗粮平均调高百分之七，华东、中南等地的大米调高百分之十，小麦和面粉的价格因偏低已久，调高百分之十六，棉花调高百分之三左右。布价降低的幅度极微，如北京一九○蓝布由四十三万元，降至四十二万五千元，仅下降百分之一点二。全国物价略有上升。根据贸易部编制的六大城市三十一种主要商品物价指数来看，十月底与九月底比较上升百分之五·九。
    各种商品涨落幅度不一，其中粮食上升较多，如上海十月三十一日与九月三十日比较，粮食类上升百分之十二点三，花纱布类上升百分之零点八，百货类上升百分之一点七。
    中央贸易部调整物价的结果，使农产品与工业品的剪刀差额较过去缩小，并得到广大农民的拥护。如河北省一个农民在天津中原公司买了一匹五福布二十四万五千元，走出门口满意地说：“布的价钱是合适了，前些日子棒子合六百多块钱一斤，二石五斗棒子才能买一个布，现在棒子涨了，布还是那个价，一石八斗棒子就能买一个布了。”兹将天津、上海、北京等地布、米交换比率，列表如下：
    （青岛系换玉米，西安系换小麦）
      九月份平均      十月二十七日  九月份与十月份比较增减％天津  二四六·三斤    二二三·八    减九·一北京  二三三·二   
   二一四·二    减八·一太原  三○四·二      二四七·八    减一八·五上海  一七二·六      一七四·一    增○·九青岛  三四九·三      二一九        减三七·三济南  三一○·四      二四六·九    减二○·五徐州  三五四·二      二八二·四    减二○·三汉口  三二六·四      二六二·五    减一九·六长沙  四一一·五      二九八·九    减二七·四西安  三三四·二      二七二·一    减一八·六重庆  三七九·四      三五三·五    减六·八
    从上表看出：除上海外，其他市场交换数字均有显著减少，十一个市场平均，较九月份减少了百分之十六点八。
    在人民政府主动调整物价过程中，少数奸商投机，扰乱市场，主要表现在纱布粮食等成交量激增，以及市场价格高于牌价等方面。自三月物价稳定后，曾一度发生市价低于牌价的现象，十月十二日中央人民政府贸易部将粮食、纱布牌价调整后，市价即追随牌价上升，并高于牌价。如十月十九日上海面粉每袋牌价七万一千元，市价七万六千元，高于牌价百分之七；二十支纱牌价六百零五万元，市价六百三十二万元，高于牌价百分之四点五。
    最近各大、中城市纱布成交数量急剧增加的现象，是不正常的。以天津为例，今年九月三十日成交纱二百八十四件，白细布一千六百四十九件，十月二十三日成交纱四百七十九件，白细布二万零三百匹，十月与九月比较，纱增加百分之六十八，布竟增加十一倍多。
    为什么纱布成交数量增加这样大呢？一方面由于秋冬是纱布销售旺月，同时今年粮食丰收，农民购买力提高，另外奸商的抢购囤积是造成市场成交量增大的重要因素。据调查上海、天津、北京等地已发现一些平日不经营纱布的商号和市民购买纱布。上海私营洲记布厂由于囤购纱布，资金周转不灵，开出十几笔空头支票，结果倒闭。
    人民政府为了稳定物价，打击投机，采取了下列措施：第一，大量出售物资，保证生产者与消费者的正当需要，使奸商不能操纵市场。从最近粮食、花纱布、煤、食盐等主要商品成交数量中，贸易公司出售数量占的比重很大，即可看出。如重庆贸易公司出售白细布的数量，八月三十日占市场总成交量百分之四十七，十月三十日竟占百分之百。私商囤积不肯出售，完全靠贸易公司供应市场需要。上海粮食公司三十日出售面粉一万二千七百袋，占市场总成交量百分之九十九。
    第二，对市场交易进行管理，防止投机。为了保障市场正常交易之进行，防止奸商的投机囤购活动，各地对纱布市场进行管理。上海工商局十月三十日公布纱布市场管理规则，主要内容是：一、集中棉纱的交易与登记工作，棉纱工厂售纱，必须全部集中市场，不得径行运销各地，并将棉纱产、销、存数字，逐日呈报工商局。二、该市，棉纱商须将购、销、存数字逐日呈报工商局。二、该市棉纱专业商号与以棉纱为主要原料之复制工厂，购纱在一件以上者，先由同业公会审核证明，经工商局核准后，始得向花纱布公司或市场购纱。三、私人存纱得于一九五○年十一月十五日以前申请出售，逾期作囤纱论处。四、停止棉纱期货交易，一律以现款实货交割为原则，并严格禁止栈单交易。五、如违犯上列各项规则之一者，依法严惩。济南也实行在场内凭证交易。上述办法可以限制私商的投机活动。
    金融市场也发生投机现象，主要表现在金银价格的猛涨，和捣贩囤购的增多。
    人民政府根据共同纲领的规定：“金银的买卖，应由国家银行经理”，“凡进行金融投机，破坏国家金融事业者，应受严厉制裁”，对捣卖金银犯，予以拘捕惩处。上海公安局十月十三日捕获正在进行金银买卖的吴生才、熊凤喜、韩必忠、万发信、叶秋萍等五犯，并抄获黄金十一两，金饰多件，美钞三十一元，银元七枚，人民币一百八十余万元，及制金模型戥子等，按其情节轻重，分别处理。其中叶秋萍无黑市买卖行为，将其所有之金饰，人民币发还释放，万发信予以拘留后教育释放，吴生才等三犯屡次捣贩金银，破坏政府法令，今年五月曾被法院拘留三十五天，罚金三百万元，但仍不悔改，已送人民法院惩办。
    北京市人民法院对捣卖黄金贩曹松亭、张玉峰、杜金生三人分别判处徒刑，曹松亭判徒刑二年，科罚金一千五百万元，张玉峰判徒刑一年半，杜金生判徒刑一年，并将捣卖之黄金，现款等予以没收。
    当贸易公司主动提高粮食牌价的时候，少数奸商曾错误地估计：“物价又要上涨了”，他们企图利用美帝国主义扩大侵略，全国人民热烈地进行抗美援朝的时机，抬高物价，谋取暴利，于是大量囤购人民的主要生活必需品纱布粮食等，但是这种如意算盘是错了。
    中央人民政府成立后，就采取各种措施，特别是今年三月实行全国财经统一，停止了十二年的通货膨胀，使金融物价趋于稳定，这说明中国人民在经济战线上的力量是强大的。今年秋季粮食、棉花的丰收，更增强我们稳定物价的力量。投机者扰乱市场的企图，必然要失败的。正如陈云副总理在中华人民共和国过去一年财政与经济工作的状况一文中所说：“一九五○年三月以后，国内市场的性质已经改变，从此以后，商业投机资本对于国内市场的领导权，永远不会存在了”，“在国民党反动统治下，经常由粮食或纱布领导物价上涨的不幸时代，从此已一去不复返了”。
