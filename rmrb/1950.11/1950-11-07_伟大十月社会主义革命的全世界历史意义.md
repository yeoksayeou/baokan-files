　　The Worldwide Historical Significance of the Great October Socialist Revolution
　　Professor You Jin, Prominent Soviet Philosopher
　　The Great October Socialist Revolution is the most outstanding event in all of human history.

　　Comrade Stalin once said: "The victory of the October Revolution is a fundamental turning point in human history, a fundamental turning point in the historical destiny of world capitalism, a fundamental turning point in the world proletarian liberation movement, and a fundamental turning point in the methods and organizational forms, customs and traditions, culture and ideology of the struggle of the world's exploited masses." (《Leninism Problems》, Chinese edition, p. 255)

　　In the past, there have been many revolutions in history. However, these revolutions were limited. They replaced the original private ownership form of the means of production with another private ownership form, and replaced the original form of exploitation with another form of exploitation. The masses of the people still remained in a state of exploitation, without rights, and in poverty.

　　The October Revolution was fundamentally different from all revolutions that had occurred in the past. It expropriated the means of production and means of production of landlords and capitalists, and transformed them into public property. It seized state power from the exploiting classes and established Soviet power, creating a socialist state of workers and peasants, and opening a new era in human history—the era of socialism.

　　★　　　　　★　　　　　★

　　The Great October Socialist Revolution completely changed the political organization of society. The Soviet state, which arose as a result of the revolution, is a new type of state fundamentally different from all states of exploiters. The Soviet multinational state opened a new page in the history of all countries and nations in the world. The establishment of the Soviet state is a truly historical creation of the masses and one of the greatest discoveries in social development. The Bolshevik Party is the leading and guiding force of the Soviet state.

　　The Soviet state could only arise and be consolidated by eliminating the old, landlord-bourgeois state and all its organs and laws. For the first time in history, a state of exploiters was completely shattered.

　　This cannot but inspire the proletarians of the world to wage a more resolute struggle against the bourgeois state, which is the main pillar of bourgeois rule.

　　The establishment and development of the Soviet state opened up unprecedentedly vast sources of initiative, vitality, wisdom, and invention among the people. From the very beginning, the Soviet state became a truly popular and truly democratic state, enabling workers to actually enjoy the rights of democracy and freedom, rights that have never been possible, even in the most democratic bourgeois republics.

　　Due to the establishment of Soviet socialist democracy, the hypocritical bourgeois parliamentary democracy was thoroughly exposed; the British and American "democracy" is a clear example of current bourgeois democracy, which the imperialists and their servants tout as the best form of democracy. In fact, these are nothing more than police states, whose purpose is not only to undermine all true democracy within their own countries, but also throughout the world, and to ensure the full dominance of imperialist reactionary forces and capitalist monopoly organizations.

　　The working class throughout the world is increasingly convinced that a proletarian socialist democracy, which is thousands of times more democratic than past and present bourgeois democracies, can be established to replace those decadent bourgeois democracies.

　　The years of the Soviet state's existence have brought new and greater victories to the Soviet people. The Soviet people have achieved unprecedented achievements in all aspects of domestic economic, political and cultural life. The Soviet Union has transformed itself from a backward country into an advanced, socialist industrialized and collectivized agricultural power.

　　The completion of socialism in the Soviet Union means the complete elimination of exploiting classes in urban and rural areas, and the thorough eradication of the phenomenon of exploitation of man by man. Due to the victory of socialism, Soviet democracy has changed from democracy for the majority to comprehensive and all-people democracy. These achievements are most fully expressed in the constitution of socialist society—the Stalin Constitution.

　　"The indisputable success of Soviet socialism on the construction front has concretely demonstrated that the proletariat can successfully manage the country without the bourgeoisie and against the bourgeoisie, can successfully build industry without the bourgeoisie and against the bourgeoisie, can successfully lead the entire national economy without the bourgeoisie and against the bourgeoisie, and can successfully build socialism despite capitalist encirclement." (《Leninism Problems》, Chinese edition, p. 257)

　　The victory of socialism in the Soviet Union has great international significance. The Soviet Union, by the very fact of its existence, its economic achievements, and its victorious communist construction, influences the international revolutionary movement. The stronger the Soviet state, the more confidence the oppressed people of the capitalist world have, and the more courageously they fight for their own liberation.

　　★　　　　　★　　 enforcement of a foreign judgment in the united states　★

　　The October Revolution not only aroused a high tide of revolution in the colonial mother countries and centers of imperialist rule, but also struck at the rear of imperialism, giving great encouragement to the national liberation movements in the colonies and dependent countries.

　　The October Revolution liberated the oppressed peoples within Tsarist Russia, who for the first time in human history gained the possibility of free national development, and influenced the oppressed nations of the world with their example. The Soviet Revolution, thanks to the genius of Lenin and Stalin, discovered the internationalist method of liberating workers.

　　Comrade Stalin once wrote: "Formerly, it was 'usually' considered that the method of bourgeois nationalism, the method of separating nations from each other, the method of dividing nations from each other, and the method of strengthening national animosity among the laboring masses of various nations, was the only method of liberating oppressed nations. Now, this absurd argument can be said to have been overthrown. One of the most important results of the October Revolution is that it gave this absurd argument a fatal blow, because it showed in fact that it is possible and appropriate to liberate oppressed nations by the only correct proletarian internationalist method; because it showed in fact that it is possible and appropriate for workers and peasants of various nationalities to form a fraternal alliance based on voluntary principles and on the basis of internationalism." (《Leninism Problems》, Chinese edition, p. 259)

　　The Soviets, as a form of state power, are, according to their own social essence, the most internationally significant organs of all possible organs of state organization within class societies. The Soviets eliminate any national oppression, and they include workers of all nationalities in their composition. In daily practical life, the Soviets truly realize fraternal cooperation between nations based on the principle of complete equality, thereby ensuring the unity of these masses in a unified national alliance.

　　After guaranteeing the establishment of national states for the liberated peoples, the Soviet state also organized systematic measures to eliminate the economic and cultural backwardness of those formerly oppressed nations, enabling them to achieve true equality in all fields of economic and cultural life.

　　As a result of all this, the national question in our country, which has many nationalities and the most complex inter-ethnic relations, has now been thoroughly resolved in the spirit of internationalism, in the spirit of Lenin's and Stalin's ideas of equality and friendship among nations.

　　All the nations of the world have seen what great achievements the Soviet regime has achieved in solving the national question, which has inspired the revolutionary spirit of the oppressed nations, making them believe that by absorbing the experience of the Soviet Union and taking the Soviet Union as an example, it is possible to solve the national question in any other country.

　　The Soviet state established by the October Revolution has pointed out to the whole world, to all nations and countries, how they should defend their national independence and sovereignty. The people's democratic countries that have formed an alliance with the Soviet Union and followed its path have also achieved national independence. At the same time, those capitalist countries, even those that have been proud of their independence for centuries and have used their will to coerce others, are now increasingly reduced to vassal states, to colonial slaves under the control of US imperialism.

　　After the Second World War, the struggle of the people of the colonies and dependent countries for their own liberation reached a particularly large scale. Comrade Stalin's words on the tenth anniversary of the October Revolution resonate with particular force today:

　　"The era of safely exploiting and safely oppressing colonies and dependent countries has passed.

　　The era of national liberation revolutions in colonies and dependent countries, the era of the awakening of the proletariat in these countries, and the era of the proletariat playing a leading role in the revolution has arrived." (《Leninism Problems》, Chinese edition, p. 259)

　　★　　　　　★　　　　　★

　　The October Socialist Revolution was a revolution "within the national scope," and also an international revolution. It broke through the front line of imperialism, causing it irreparable damage. It set off a huge wave of revolutionary movements in many countries of the world.

　　Under the influence of the socialist revolution, the international proletarian and national liberation movements have been raised to a new and higher stage. In some countries, the working class immediately launched a direct attack on capitalism after the October Revolution, intending to overthrow the bourgeoisie by revolutionary means and seize state power into their own hands (such as Bavaria, Hungary). In many countries, proletarian communist parties were formed that broke away from the opportunism of the Second International and led the revolutionary struggle of the working class. The Third International, the Communist International, was born. It played a major historical role in inspiring the international revolutionary struggle, in organizing Marxist revolutionary parties, and in cultivating new leaders of the working class.

　　The Soviet people stood at the forefront of the international revolutionary movement, at the forefront of all democratic and progressive forces. The Soviet state, headed by the Bolshevik Party, has successfully carried out this vanguard task throughout its history.

　　When the Chinese people launched a national liberation struggle, under the leadership of Sun Yat-sen, and aroused a great struggle in China, the Soviet people gave this movement selfless assistance. When the Spanish people launched a struggle against the armed intervention of the fascist countries—Italy and Germany—the first words that encouraged the Spanish people to rise up in a sacred struggle were spoken by Comrade Stalin, the leader of the Soviet people. At that time, he pointed out that the struggle of the Spanish people was not a private matter of the Spanish people, but a common cause of all advanced and progressive mankind. When the grave crisis of fascist enslavement of the European people by German and Italian imperialism threatened the world, only the Soviet Union thoroughly and relentlessly exposed these aggressive plans and fought against the instigators of world war. When the Second World War broke out due to the guilt and direct connivance of the British, French, and American imperialists, when almost all of Europe had been enslaved by Hitler's Germany, and when the shameless German fascist bandits attacked the Soviet Union—at this critical moment in human destiny, it was the Soviet Union that stood at the forefront of the anti-fascist struggle of all countries.

　　The Great Patriotic War caused the Soviet Union a large number of casualties and countless material losses. However, the Soviet state did not stop moving forward because of any difficulties, but gloriously completed the lofty mission of the liberator of the European people. The armed forces of the Soviet state played a decisive role in crushing the German fascist bandits, liberating the European people from the shackles of fascism and saving European civilization.

　　The Soviet state provided great and selfless assistance to the people of many European countries with its armed forces. The people of these countries are deeply grateful to the Soviet Union and loyal to the Soviet Union, because without the help of the Soviet Union, they would not have been able to liberate themselves from the oppression of German imperialism, nor from the oppression of their own domestic bourgeoisie and landlords, who betrayed the interests of their own people and were slaves of German fascism.

　　After the end of the Second World War, the US imperialist group, which made a fortune in the war, in the bloodshed and poverty of the people of all countries, intended to gain world hegemony and began to prepare for a new world war. Even now, the Soviet state firmly and unswervingly puts forward a policy of defending peace and democracy to oppose the policy of inciting war by the US and British imperialists, and relentlessly exposes the criminal conspiracies of the US and British imperialist war instigators.

　　The Soviet socialist state follows the instructions of its great founders Lenin and Stalin on the possibility of peaceful coexistence between the Soviet Union and capitalist countries. The Soviet Union is an unbreakable rock, a staunch defender of the cause of peace, and a defender of the interests of the workers of the world. It leads the anti-imperialist democratic camp. This has further increased the prestige of the Soviet state in the minds of all progressive mankind, and has won the love and loyalty of all advocates of peace and democracy.

　　The statements made by the communist parties of France, Italy, Japan, Norway, Australia and other capitalist countries that the people of their countries are unwilling to fight against the Soviet Union express the consensus of the conscious working people of the world.

　　★　　　　　★　　　　　★

　　Stalin taught: "The October Revolution is not only a revolution in economic relations and social and political relations. The October Revolution is also a revolution in wisdom, a revolution in the thinking of the working class." (《Leninism Problems》, Chinese edition, p. 261)

　　The Bolshevik Party, by following the Marxist-Leninist theory which was ingeniously developed by Comrade Stalin, won the victory of the October Revolution and built socialism.

　　The great significance of the October Revolution also lies in the establishment of a new type of culture in the Soviet Union, a culture of the socialist era. Soviet socialist culture is opposed to modern bourgeois culture, which is based on national hatred and chauvinism, praises the ugly capitalist customs, and defends social inequality and the exploitation of man by man. Soviet socialist culture, on the other hand, is based on the principle of irreconcilable struggle against any kind of oppression of man by man and exploitation of man by man, on the principle of fighting against the barbaric customs of capitalism, for truly human relations between people, for comradely cooperation and mutual assistance, and for equal rights and friendship among all nations. This is the culture of the future, the culture of all mankind.

　　The victory of the October Revolution is the greatest practical verification of the strong and powerful nature of Leninism and the complete bankruptcy of reformism. The socialist revolution gave the social democrats a fatal blow. These so-called "socialist" gentlemen have directly and openly turned to the position of international imperialism. One of the great contributions of the Soviet Revolution is that it thoroughly exposed and revealed those traitors and spies of the working class.

　　Under the existing conditions, the traitors who betray the interests of the working class, the right-wing socialists, are helping the US imperialists to carry out their attempts to establish their own world hegemony. They are enthusiastic instigators of new wars and are the mortal enemies of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. The ideological system of the right-wing social democrats is a pillar of the ideology of imperialism.

　　"Unless social democracy in the workers' movement is eliminated—capitalism cannot be eliminated. Therefore, the era of the decline of capitalism is also the era of the decline of social democracy in the workers' movement." (《Leninism Problems》, Chinese edition, p. 263)

　　★　　　　　★　　　　　★

　　The outstanding international significance of the October Socialist Revolution lies in the fact that it opened up and actually pointed out the road to socialist construction. The working class of the world has understood the world historical significance of the Russian socialist revolution. They saw their own example in the greatest policies that the Soviet state began to implement from the very beginning of its establishment. Lenin once wrote about this:

　　"For all countries of the world, the example of Russia is their inevitable and soon-to-be-arrived-at most realistic example. The advanced workers of the world have long understood this—and rather than understanding, they have felt this with their revolutionary class nature." (《Complete Works of Lenin》, Volume 25, Third Edition, p. 171)

　　The basic law of capitalist development is the common law of development of all capitalist countries. Everywhere, capitalism is built on the basis of the exploitation of the working class by the bourgeoisie. Although the particularity and characteristics of individual capitalist countries also bring many of their own national things into the forms and methods of the working class struggle, they can never change the main point: that is, the irreconcilable struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat.

　　Lenin once pointed out that different countries will follow their own paths to socialism. However, the class essence of these different paths is the same: that is, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, overthrowing capitalism and building socialism.

　　The experience of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) is an experience of worldwide historical significance. This experience, in its basics, main points, and most important points, is acceptable and must be accepted by the communist parties of all countries in the world that are carrying out the struggle to realize the socialist revolution or are engaged in socialist construction. This experience is of particular importance today for the countries of Eastern and Southeastern Europe that have embarked on the road to socialism.

　　It goes without saying that the same prescription cannot be applied to all countries. For example, Czechoslovakia is a highly developed industrial country, where the task of establishing socialist industry is different from that of, say, Bulgaria, a typical agricultural country. Similarly, the issues of practically implementing socialist construction in Poland and Romania are also different. These countries differ in their industrial development and cultural level.

　　Building socialism in the people's democratic countries is only possible by forming a fraternal alliance with other countries that are building socialism, forming an alliance with the great country where socialism has already triumphed—the Soviet Union—and forming an alliance with and with the support of the proletariat and communist parties throughout the world.

　　The experience of the Soviet Union is the practical embodiment of the Marxist-Leninist theory of socialist construction. This experience teaches us that socialism can only be built in a resolute struggle against the exploiting classes. Socialism means eliminating and clearing away these classes. This experience also teaches us that socialism should be built not only in the cities, but also in the countryside. This means gradually and firmly cultivating the countryside and the working peasants to turn to the socialization of the means of production, transitioning from the individual peasant economy to the collective farm system.

　　In the people's democratic countries, power belongs to the working people, and its decisive force is the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class. The people's democratic countries have entered the transitional period from capitalism to socialism.

　　The experience of the people's democratic countries proves that those other countries that are about to have power grasped by the workers under the leadership of the working class will also follow the path opened up by the October Revolution, and will develop by taking into account the characteristics of each country's social, national, and historical development.

　　The strength of the world workers' movement lies in its loyalty to the great idea of proletarian internationalism. Any violation of this idea is a betrayal of the cause of socialism and a turn to the bourgeois camp. The Trotskyite and Bukharinite traitors were like this. They betrayed internationalism and became direct agents of imperialist spies. The Tito gang in Yugoslavia is like this now. The Tito gang of bourgeois nationalists, after betraying internationalism, took the shameful road from socialism to fascism, and completely ran from the camp of democracy and socialism to the camp of the mortal enemies of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries and the communist movement throughout the world, to the lair of imperialism and fascism.

　　The Tito gang's notoriously Trotskyite policy has encountered growing resistance from the workers in Yugoslavia. Disregarding the terrorist policies and secret police rule of the Tito fascist gang, the workers in Yugoslavia have re-established underground the fighting party—the Communist Party—which is loyal to Marxism-Leninism and loyal to proletarian internationalism. It is leading the workers to fight for Yugoslavia to return to the camp of socialism and democracy.

　　★　　　　　★　　　　　★

　　From the earliest days of the Soviet Revolution, the world has been divided into two systems: the young, growing socialist system and the aging, decaying capitalist system. Humanity has been divided into two camps: the supporters of the October Socialist Revolution and its mortal enemies. The gap between these two camps has deepened year by year. Today, this gap divides the anti-democratic imperialist camp headed by the US and British imperialists and the democratic anti-imperialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

　　After building socialism, the Soviet state has entered a new stage of its development—a new stage of completing the construction of socialism and gradually transitioning from socialism to communism.

　　The Soviet people have achieved tremendous success on this road. When those oldest capitalist countries—Britain, France, and Italy—are struggling in the throes of the post-war crisis, and cannot extricate themselves from economic and political chaos no matter what, the Soviet Union has long surpassed the pre-war level in terms of the total output of industrial products, and the grain production in agriculture has also reached the level of the pre-war years.

　　The Soviet state, which has grown into a powerful socialist force, is a great factor in international development.

　　Lenin's words on the fourth anniversary of the October Revolution resonate powerfully today: "We have begun this cause. When, and in what time frame, the proletariat of that nation will carry this cause to the end—this is not an important question. What is important is: the ice has been broken, the path has been opened, and the road has been pointed out." (《Complete Works of Lenin》, Third Edition, p. 28)

　　伟大十月社会主义革命的全世界历史意义
    苏联著名哲学家尤金教授
    伟大的十月社会主义革命是人类全部历史上一件最杰出的事件。
    斯大林同志曾经说过：“十月革命的胜利是人类史中的根本转变，是世界资本主义历史命运中的根本转变，是世界无产阶级解放运动中的根本转变，是全世界被剥削群众的斗争方法和组织形式、风俗和传统、文化和思想体系中的根本转变。”（《列宁主义问题》，中文本，二五五页）
    在过去，历史上有过不少次的革命。可是这些革命都是有限度的。它们以另外一种生产资料私有制的形式来代替原来的私有制形式，以另外一种剥削方式来代替原来的剥削方式。而人民大众则仍然停留在被剥削、毫无权利和困苦的情况下。
    十月革命与过去所发生的一切革命根本不同。它剥夺了地主和资本家的生产工具和生产资料，并将其变为公共财产，它夺取了剥削阶级的国家政权而建立了苏维埃政权，创立了工农社会主义国家，并开创了人类历史上的新纪元——社会主义的纪元。
    ★          ★        ★
    伟大的十月社会主义革命彻底改变了社会的政治组织。由于革命而产生的苏维埃国家，乃是与一切剥削者的国家根本不同的一种新型的国家。苏维埃多民族国家在全世界各国、各民族的历史上揭开了崭新的一页。苏维埃国家的建立，乃是群众的真正历史性的创造和社会发展中的一个最伟大的发现。布尔什维克党就是苏维埃国家的领导力量和指导力量。
    苏维埃国家，只有在消灭了旧的、地主资产阶级的国家及其一切机关与法律的基础上，才能产生和巩固起来。一个剥削者的国家在历史上第一次被彻底粉碎了。
    这不能不鼓舞起全世界无产者去作更坚决的斗争，反对作为资产阶级统治主要支柱的资产阶级国家。
    苏维埃国家的建立和发展过程打开了空前未有的广大人民首创精神、活力、智慧和发明的泉源。苏维埃国家一开始便成了真正人民的和真正民主的国家，它使劳动者能在实际上享有民主和自由的权利，这些权利，甚至在那些最民主的资产阶级共和国内，亦是从来没有而且也不可能有的。
    由于苏维埃社会主义民主制的建立，虚伪的资产阶级的议会民主制就被彻底拆穿了；英美的“民主”制，就是现今资产阶级民主制的一个显明的例子，帝国主义者及其仆从们将这种民主吹嘘为民主制的最好形式。而事实上，这只不过是一些警察国家，它们的目的是不仅要在自己国家内，而且要在全世界破坏一切真正的民主，而确保帝国主义反动势力和资本主义垄断组织的全面统治权。
    全世界的工人阶级日益确信，那种比起过去和现存的资产阶级民主制要民主千万倍的无产阶级社会主义民主制，是能够被建立起来，以代替那些腐朽的资产阶级民主制的。
    苏维埃国家存在的诸年，为苏联人民带来了新而又新的胜利。苏联人民在国内经济、政治和文化生活各方面都获得了空前的成就。苏联已自一个落后的国家成为先进的、社会主义工业化以及农业集体化的强国。
    社会主义在苏联的建成，就意味着城乡剥削阶级之完全消灭，以及人剥削人现象之彻底铲除。苏维埃民主制，由于社会主义的胜利，已经从大多数人的民主变成了全面的和全民的民主制。这些成就，在社会主义社会的宪法——斯大林宪法中，得到了最充分的表现。
    “苏联社会主义在建设战线上各种毫无疑义的成功，已经具体表明：无产阶级能够不要资产阶级并反对着资产阶级来顺利管理国家，能够不要资产阶级并反对着资产阶级来顺利建设工业，能够不要资产阶级并反对着资产阶级来顺利领导全部国民经济，能够不顾资本主义包围而顺利建设社会主义。”（《列宁主义问题》，中文本，二五七页）
    社会主义在苏联的胜利具有巨大的国际意义。苏联以其本身存在这一事实，它在经济上的成就及其共产主义的胜利建设影响着国际革命运动。苏维埃国家愈强大，资本主义世界被压迫的人们就愈有信心，愈加勇敢地进行争取自己解放的斗争。
    ★          ★        ★
    十月革命不仅在各殖民地宗主国和帝国主义统治的中心地唤起了革命的高涨，并且打击了帝国主义的后方，给予各殖民地及各附庸国的民族解放运动以巨大的鼓舞。
    十月革命解放了沙皇俄国国内被压迫的各族人民，他们在人类的历史上第一次获得了民族自由发展的可能，而以自己的榜样影响着全世界诸被压迫民族。苏维埃革命由于列宁、斯大林的天才而发现了解放劳动者的国际主义的方法。
    斯大林同志曾经写道：“从前，‘照例总是’认为：资产阶级民族主义的方法，使民族彼此脱离的方法，使民族彼此分开的方法，使各民族劳动群众间民族恶感加强的方法，是解放被压迫民族的唯一方法。现在，这种奇谈要算是已被推翻了。十月革命最重要的结果之一，就是它给了这种奇谈一个致命的打击，因为它在事实上表明了，用唯一正确的无产阶级国际主义方法解放被压迫民族，是可能而且适当的；因为它在事实上表明了，各种民族中的工农根据自愿原则和在国际主义基础上结成兄弟联盟，是可能而且适当的。”（《列宁主义问题》，中文本，二五九页）
    作为国家政权一种形式的苏维埃，按照它们本身的社会本质来说，乃是阶级社会内国家组织之一切能有的机关中最有国际意义的机关。苏维埃消灭了任何的民族压迫，它们把一切民族的劳动者包括在自己的组成成份内。苏维埃在日常实际生活中，确实根据完全平等的原则而实现着各民族之间兄弟般的合作，从而保证将这些群众团结在统一的国家联盟之中。
    苏维埃国家在保证已获得自由的各族人民成立民族国家后，又以巨大的系统的措施组织了消灭那些早先被压迫各民族在经济上和文化上的落后的工作，使他们在经济和文化生活的一切领域内获得了真正的平等。
    所有这一切的结果，是在我们这个有着许多民族、各民族之间相互关系的问题最为复杂的国家里，民族问题现在已经以国际主义的精神，以列宁、斯大林各民族间平等和友好思想的精神彻底解决了。
    全世界各民族已经看到，苏维埃政权在解决民族问题方面，获得了何等伟大的成果，这就鼓舞了各被压迫民族的革命精神，使他们相信，吸收苏联的经验并以苏联为榜样，就可能在其他任何一个国家内解决民族问题。
    十月革命所建立的苏维埃国家，向全世界、向各民族和各国指明应当如何捍卫自己民族的独立和主权。与苏联缔结同盟并循着它的道路走的各人民民主国家，也同样地获得了民族的独立。而同时，那些资本主义国家，甚至那些数世纪来以自己的独立自豪、并以自己的意志强制他人的资本主义国家，现在都日甚一日地沦为仆从国，沦为美帝国主义控制下的殖民地奴隶。
    在第二次世界大战以后，诸殖民地和附庸国的人民争取自己解放的斗争，达到了特别巨大的规模。斯大林同志在十月革命十周年所说的话，现在特别有力地响彻着：
    “安然剥削和安然压迫殖民地和依赖国的纪元，已经过去了。
    殖民地和依赖国里民族解放革命的纪元，这些国家中无产阶级觉醒的纪元，无产阶级在革命中起领导作用的纪元，已经到来了。”（《列宁主义问题》，中文本，二五九页）
    ★          ★        ★
    十月社会主义革命是“民族范围内”的革命，同时也是国际性的革命，它冲破了帝国主义的战线，使之遭受了无可补救的打击。它在世界上许多国家内掀起了革命运动的巨浪。
    国际无产阶级和民族解放运动，在社会主义革命的影响下，已经提高到新的、更高的阶段。若干国家中的工人阶级，曾在十月革命以后，马上就直接地进行对资本主义的攻击，打算以革命的方法推翻资产阶级，把国家政权夺取到自己手中来（如巴伐利亚，匈牙利）。在很多国家内产生了与第二国际机会主义断绝关系、并领导工人阶级的革命斗争的无产阶级共产党。第三国际，共产国际诞生了，在鼓舞国际革命斗争中，在组织马克思主义革命政党中，在培养工人阶级新领袖之工作中，它起了重大的具有历史意义的作用。
    苏联人民站到了国际革命运动的前卫，站到了一切民主力量和进步力量的前卫。以布尔什维克党为首的苏维埃国家，在自己的全部历史中，顺利地执行着这一先锋队的任务。
    当中国人民掀起了民族解放斗争，在孙中山领导下，在中国激起了伟大的斗争的时候，苏联人民曾经给予这一运动以大公无私的援助。当西班牙人民掀起了反对法西斯国家——意大利、德国——武装干涉的斗争的时候，鼓舞西班牙人民起来进行神圣斗争的第一句话，就是苏维埃人民的领袖斯大林同志所说的。当时他曾指出，西班牙人民的斗争，不是西班牙人的私事，而是所有先进和进步人类的共同事业。当德、意帝国主义对欧洲人民进行法西斯奴役的严重危机威胁全世界的时候，只有苏联是彻底而无情地揭露了这些侵略计划，并与世界战争挑拨者进行斗争。当由于英、法、美帝国主义者们的罪过与直接纵容而爆发了第二次世界大战的时候，当几乎整个欧洲已被希特勒德国所奴役、无耻的德国法西斯强盗进攻苏联的时候——在这人类命运千钧一发之际，正是苏联站在各国人民反法西斯主义斗争的前卫。
    伟大的卫国战争使苏联遭受到大量的人员牺牲，以及无数物质上的损失。可是，苏维埃国家并不因任何困难而停止前进，而光荣地完成了欧洲人民解放者的崇高使命。苏维埃国家的武装力量，在粉碎德国法西斯匪帮的事业中起了决定性的作用，它把欧洲人民从法西斯主义的枷锁下解放出来，拯救了欧洲的文明。
    苏维埃国家以自己的武装力量，给予了欧洲许多国家的人民以伟大无私的援助。这些国家的人民对于苏联感激不尽，而忠诚于苏联，因为如果没有苏联的帮助，他们就既不能从德国帝国主义的压迫下解放出来，也不能从自己国内的资产阶级及地主的压迫下解放出来，这些资产阶级和地主们，都是出卖本国人民利益的，并是德国法西斯的奴仆。
    第二次世界大战结束以后，在战争中，在各国人民的流血和穷困中大发其财的美帝国主义集团，意图取得世界霸权，而开始准备新的世界大战。而就在现在，苏维埃国家坚决不移地提出保卫和平和民主的政策，用以反对美英帝国主义者们煽动战争的政策，并且无情地揭露美英帝国主义战争挑拨者们的罪恶阴谋。
    苏维埃社会主义国家遵循着自己的伟大奠基者列宁和斯大林关于苏联可能与资本主义国家和平共存的指示。苏联是一座牢不可破的山岩，是和平事业的忠实保卫者，以及全世界劳动者利益的捍卫者，它领导着反帝的民主阵营。这就更加提高了苏维埃国家在一切进步人类心目中的威信，博得了所有和平与民主的拥护者对它的热爱和忠诚。
    法国、意大利、日本、挪威、澳大利亚及其他资本主义国家的共产党所作关于他们国家的人民不愿与苏联作战的声明，表现着全世界觉悟的劳动人民的公论。
    ★          ★        ★
    斯大林教导说：“十月革命不仅是经济关系和社会政治关系方面的革命。十月革命同时又是智慧中的革命，是工人阶级思想中的革命。”（《列宁主义问题》，中文本，二六一页）
    布尔什维克党由于遵循着斯大林同志天才发展着的马列主义理论，获得了十月革命的胜利，而且建成了社会主义。
    十月革命的伟大意义也在于在苏联已建立了新型的文化，社会主义时代的文化。苏维埃社会主义的文化与现代资产阶级的文化相对立，资产阶级的文化建立在民族仇视和沙文主义的基础上，它颂扬丑恶的资本主义风俗习惯，并为社会上的不平等和人剥削人现象辩护。而苏维埃社会主义的文化，则建立在与任何种人压迫人及人剥削人的现象作不调和斗争的原则上，建立在与资本主义的野蛮习俗作斗争，为人与人之间真正的人类关系，为同志般的合作及互助，以及为各民族的平等权利和友好而斗争的原则上。这是未来的文化，全人类的文化。
    十月革命的胜利，就是列宁主义思想的强而有力和改良主义的完全破产的一个最伟大的实际的验证。社会主义革命给予了社会民主党一个致命的打击。这些所谓“社会主义者”的大人先生们已直接而公然地转到国际帝国主义的立场上去了。苏维埃革命的巨大贡献之一，就在于它彻底地暴露并揭穿了那些工人阶级的叛徒和奸细。
    在现有条件下，出卖工人阶级利益的叛徒们，右派社会主义者，正在帮助着美帝国主义者遂行其建立自己世界霸权的企图，他们正是热心的新战争挑拨者，是苏联及各人民民主国家的死敌。右派社会民主党人的思想体系，就是帝国主义的思想的支柱。
    “除非消灭工人运动中的社会民主主义——就无法消灭资本主义。因此，资本主义衰亡的纪元，同时就是社会民主主义在工人运动中衰亡的纪元。”（《列宁主义问题》，中文本，二六三页）

    十月社会主义革命的卓越的国际意义，就在于它开辟了而且在实际上指出了社会主义建设的道路。全世界的工人阶级已经懂得俄国社会主义革命这一项全世界历史意义的作用。他们在苏维埃国家于其成立初期即开始实行的那些最伟大的政策中，看到了自己的榜样。对此，列宁曾经写道：
    “对于全世界各国，俄国的榜样，是他们的不可避免的和不久即将到来的最现实的榜样。全世界的先进工人早就理解到这一点，——而与其说是理解，无宁说是具有革命阶级天性的他们已经感觉到了这一点。”（《列宁全集》，第二十五卷，第三版，一七一页）
    资本主义基本的发展规律，就是所有资本主义国家发展的共同规律。无论在什么地方，资本主义都是建立在资产阶级对工人阶级的剥削基础上的。个别资本主义国家的特殊性与特点，虽然也给工人阶级斗争的形式和方法，带进许多自己的、民族的东西，但是它们绝不能改变主要的一点：即是资产阶级与无产阶级间不可调和的斗争。
    列宁曾经指出，各个不同的国家将遵循自己的道路走向社会主义。可是，这些不同道路的阶级本质则是相同的：即无产阶级与资产阶级之间的斗争，推翻资本主义并建设社会主义。
    联共（布）的经验乃是具有全世界历史意义的经验。这种经验在基本上、主要之点上和最重要之点上，对于正在进行实现社会主义革命的斗争，或是在从事社会主义建设的世界各国共产党，是可以接受而且是必然接受的。这种经验在今天，对已走上社会主义道路的东欧及东南欧诸国家更具有特殊的重要性。
    不言而喻，不能对于所有的国家都下同一的处方。例如，捷克斯洛伐克是高度发展的工业国家，在那里，建立社会主义工业的任务，是不同于，比方说，典型农业国家保加利亚的。同样，关于在波兰及罗马尼亚实际实施社会主义建设的问题，也是各各不同的。这些国家的工业发展和文化水平都是有区别的。
    在人民民主国家内建成社会主义，只有与其他正在建设社会主义的国家结成兄弟同盟，与社会主义已经取得胜利的伟大国家——苏联结成同盟，与全世界无产阶级及共产党结成同盟并在其支持之下，才是可能的。
    苏联的经验，就是马列主义关于建设社会主义的理论之实际体现。这种经验教导我们，社会主义只有在与剥削阶级坚决斗争中才能建立起来。社会主义就是要消灭和肃清这些阶级。这种经验同样也教导我们，不仅要在城市中，而且应当在乡村中建设社会主义。这就是说，要逐步地并坚定不移地培养乡村和劳动农民使之转向生产资料的社会化，从个体农民经济过渡到集体农庄制。
    在各人民民主国家内，政权是属于劳动人民的，它的决定力量，乃是工人阶级领导下的工农联盟。各人民民主国家已经进入了从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期。
    人民民主国家的经验证明，那些行将由劳动者在工人阶级的领导下掌握政权的其他国家，亦将遵循十月革命所开辟的道路，并估计到每一国家的社会、民族和历史发展的特点而得到发展。
    世界工人运动的力量，乃是在于它对无产阶级国际主义伟大思想的忠诚。对于这种思想的任何违背，都是背叛社会主义事业而转到资产阶级阵营中去。托洛茨基、布哈林叛徒就是这样，他们背叛了国际主义而成了帝国主义间谍们的直接代理人。现在南斯拉夫的铁托匪帮，也就是这样。资产阶级民族主义的铁托匪帮，背叛了国际主义之后，走过了由社会主义转到法西斯主义的可耻的道路，而全然地从民主和社会主义阵营跑到苏联和各人民民主国家以及全世界共产主义运动的死敌的阵营中去了，跑到帝国主义和法西斯主义的巢穴中去了。
    铁托匪帮罪恶昭彰的托洛茨基派的政策，遭遇到南斯拉夫劳动者日益增长的反抗。南斯拉夫的劳动者不顾铁托法西斯匪帮的恐怖政策和秘密警察的统治，在地下重新建立了忠于马列主义、忠于无产阶级国际主义的战斗党——共产党，它正领导着劳动者为争取南斯拉夫重新回到社会主义和民主阵营而斗争。

    从苏维埃革命最初的日子起，世界就分成了两个体系：年青的、日益壮大的社会主义体系和衰老的、腐朽的资本主义体系。人类分成了两个阵营：十月社会主义革命的拥护者及其死敌。这两个阵营之间的鸿沟，一年年地加深了。在今日，这条鸿沟分成以美英帝国主义者为首的反民主的帝国主义阵营和以苏联为首的民主的反帝国主义阵营。
    苏维埃国家在建成了社会主义之后，已进入了自己发展的新阶段——完成了社会主义的建设而逐渐地从社会主义过渡到共产主义的新阶段。
    苏联人民在这条路上已经获得了巨大的成就。当那些最老朽的资本主义国家——英、法、意——正在战后危机的困窘中竭力挣扎，而无论如何也不能从经济和政治的混乱中自拔出来的时候，苏联在工业生产品的总产量方面，早已超过了战前的水平，而农业方面的谷物生产亦已达到了战前诸年的水平。
    已成长为强大的社会主义力量之苏维埃国家，乃是国际发展的一个伟大的因素。
    列宁在十月革命四周年时所说的话，在今天有力地响彻着：“我们已经开始了这一事业。何时，在怎样个期限里，那一个民族的无产者把这一事业进行到底——这是不重要的问题。重要的是：坚冰已经被凿破，途径已经开辟，道路已指示出来了。”（《列宁全集》，第三版，二十八页）
