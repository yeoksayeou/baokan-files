　　Rehe People Cherish the Memory of the Soviet Anti-Epidemic Team
    Thanking Them for Their Great Contribution in Eliminating the Plague
    Xinhua News Agency, Chengde, 8th. Around the celebration of the October Revolution Day in the Soviet Union, people from various parts of Rehe Province have written to the Chengde Masses Daily, expressing their gratitude to the Soviet anti-epidemic team for their great contribution to eliminating the severe plague disaster in the province.

　　Since the time of the puppet Manchukuo, seven banners and counties including Aohan Banner in the province have been plague-prone areas. In 1947, more than 12,000 people died from the plague. However, since the Soviet anti-epidemic team came twice in 1948 to assist Chinese anti-epidemic personnel in prevention and treatment, the epidemic gradually decreased. The year before last, more than 2,200 people died, last year 36 people died, and this year basically no plague has occurred.

　　The Soviet anti-epidemic team's high degree of internationalist friendship and arduous working style have left an indelible impression on the people of Rehe. Last year, when the anti-epidemic team was working in the heavy epidemic area of ​​Kalaqin Banner, they braved more than 50 days of continuous rain, crossed rivers and streams during mountain floods, and traveled back and forth on rugged mountain roads to rescue patients. Many anti-epidemic team members even saved their own bread and sausages to give to the patients. The team's female captain, Hekhlova, insisted on treating patients despite her illness and personally participated in nursing, saving and curing many dying patients. The people in the epidemic area gratefully called her "the mother of rebirth."

　　The provincial branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association also expressed its special gratitude to the Soviet Union for its lofty and profound friendship with the Chinese people in a telegram to Marshal Stalin congratulating him on the October Revolution Day.

　　热河人民怀念苏联防疫队
    感谢消灭鼠疫伟大功绩
    【新华社承德八日电】热河省各地人民在欢庆苏联十月革命节前后，纷纷致函承德群众日报，感谢苏联防疫队帮助消灭该省严重岚疫灾害的伟大功绩。
    该省敖汉旗等七个旗、县，自伪满以来即为鼠疫流行地区，一九四七年死于鼠疫者曾达一万二千余人，但自一九四八年苏联防疫队两次前来协助我国防疫人员进行预防治疗工作以后，疫情乃逐渐减少，前年死亡二千二百余人，去年死亡三十六人，而今年则基本上未发生鼠疫。
    对于苏联防疫队高度的国际主义友爱精神和艰苦卓绝的工作作风，留给热河人民不可磨灭的印象。去年该防疫队在重疫区喀喇沁旗一带工作时，曾冒着五十多天的连绵阴雨，在山洪暴发时渡河涉水，往返于崎岖山路间抢救患者。防疫队员中更有不少人将自己的面包、香肠省下来送给病人吃。该队女队长赫赫洛娃带病坚持治疗，亲自参加看护，将许多垂死的病人救活并治愈。疫区的人民感激地称呼她为“再生的母亲”。
    该省中苏友好协会分会在致斯大林大元帅祝贺十月革命节的电文中，也特别表示感谢苏联对中国人民这种崇高深厚的友谊。
