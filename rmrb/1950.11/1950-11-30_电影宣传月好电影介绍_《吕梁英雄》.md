　　Good Movie Introduction for Movie Promotion Month
    "Heroes of Lüliang"
    The five-star red flag is flying in the sky of our motherland. You can take a train from the south, where coconut trees grow, all the way to the vast North China Plain. This is a symbol of the great victory of the Chinese people.
    Defeating the enemy is by no means a matter of one or two people. The people of the Lüliang Mountains in the film "Heroes of Lüliang" represent the deeds of our people across the country who engaged in arduous struggles against the enemy during the War of Resistance Against Japan. The bravery shown by Zhu Zi, Erwa, and others in the battle demonstrates the people's hatred for the enemy. Zhang Lao Han rolled off the cliff with the enemy in order to save the people of the whole village. This great spirit of self-sacrifice proves his hatred for the enemy and his love for the motherland and the people.
    When the people of the Lüliang Mountains understood that unity is strength, they exerted infinite wisdom. Guerrilla warfare, minefields, and tunnel warfare, these wonderful tactics, made the devils tremble with fear. But we must never forget that the hidden enemies are always trying to destroy the fruits of our victory. Like Kang Xixue, the traitorous landlord in Heroes of Lüliang, who pretended to be enlightened and progressive on the surface, but secretly colluded with the enemy to undermine the War of Resistance Against Japan. Even today, we should be more vigilant to prevent traitors and spies.
    Today, American imperialism dreams of inheriting the mantle of Japanese fascism, creating war and death for mankind. We can no longer sit idly by and watch the shameless arrogance of American imperialism. If the robbers do not retreat in the face of difficulty, the Chinese people will completely eliminate them. The Chinese people are very clear that today there is only one way: to resist America and aid Korea, and like the characters in "Heroes of Lüliang," constantly strike at the enemy!

    《吕梁英雄》
    我们祖国的天空里飘扬起了五星红旗，从生长椰子林的南方可以乘火车一直行驶到辽阔的华北平原，这是中国人民的伟大胜利的象征。
    要打垮敌人决不是一两个人的事，《吕梁英雄》影片里吕梁山区的人民正是代表着我全国人民在抗日战争中间和敌人展开坚苦斗争的事迹。柱子、二娃他们在战斗中所表现的勇敢，正是说明了人民对敌人的仇恨。张老汉为了拯救全村的人民，和敌人一同滚落悬崖，这种伟大的自我牺牲精神，证明了他对敌人的恨，和对祖国、人民的爱。
    当吕梁山区的人民懂得了团结就是力量的时候，曾经发挥了无穷的智慧，游击战、地雷阵、地洞战这些奇妙的战术，都使鬼子心惊胆怕。但是我们千万不要忘记，暗藏着的敌人时时想破坏我们胜利的成果。像吕梁英雄里的汉奸地主康锡雪，表面上伪装开明进步，暗地里却勾结敌人破坏抗日战争。就是今天，我们更应该提高警惕，防奸防特。
    今天美帝又梦想继承日本法西斯的衣钵，给人类制造战争、死亡，我们再也不能坐视美帝的无耻猖狂。如果强盗们不知难而退，中国人民就将彻底消灭它。中国人民已经十分清楚，在今天只有一条路，就是起来抗美援朝，像《吕梁英雄》里的人物，不断给敌人以打击！
