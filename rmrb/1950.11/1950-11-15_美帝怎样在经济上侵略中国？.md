How U.S. Imperialism Economically Aggresses Against China
Sun Huairen

Among the group of imperialist nations that aggressed against China, Japan can be said to have acted in the most "shameless and unrestrained" manner, while the United States can be said to be the most "honey-mouthed and dagger-hearted." Therefore, when Japan is mentioned, everyone feels the same hatred and indignation, but when the United States is mentioned, some people still harbor illusions about it.

In fact, since 1844, when the United States forced the Qing Dynasty to conclude the first Sino-American unequal treaty, establishing the principle of "consular jurisdiction," it has had a history of aggression against China for more than a hundred years. However, it has been very cunning in that it neither seized any concessions in China, nor wanted any spheres of influence, nor did it demand any rights or interests in any significant way. Sometimes, it even pretended to be fair and sympathetic when appearing on the Chinese stage. This cunning style is precisely the characteristic of U.S. imperialism. The reason why U.S. imperialism adopted this approach is not because it is being benevolent, but on the contrary, it shows that the U.S. is a particularly insidious aggressor.

Before the 1890s, American capitalism was still in the stage of growth and expansion, and therefore, its strength was far inferior to that of advanced capitalist countries such as Britain and France. Geographically, it was also not as close to China as Japan. Therefore, in this stage, it was never able to stand shoulder to shoulder with other imperialists in dividing spheres of influence and competing for rights and interests in China. By 1898, which was the most intense period of contention for dominance in China by various imperialists, the United States was fighting a war with Spain for the Philippines. The Spanish-American War (April-December 1898) on the one hand, completely confirmed that the United States had exposed its imperialist face, but on the other hand, it lost the opportunity for the U.S. to "share the spoils" in China because of this war. However, at that time, the interests of the United States in China were mainly in trade, especially in the years after the Sino-Japanese War, American trade with China had developed rapidly. In 1880, imports from China were about 22 million U.S. dollars, and exports to China were only about 1 million U.S. dollars. However, in 1890, imports were about 16.25 million U.S. dollars, while exports had reached 3 million U.S. dollars. Later, exports increased even more rapidly, reaching about 27 million U.S. dollars in imports and 15 million U.S. dollars in exports in 1900, a five-fold increase in ten years. By 1902, exports had even exceeded imports.

Therefore, the United States, considering that it had already lagged behind in the competition for rights and interests in China and had no way to intervene, was happy to do a "smooth favor," pretending to be a "defender of morality," and in August 1899, it sent a note to various countries "opposing" the partition of China, principally denying "spheres of influence," and advocating the "Open Door Policy." This trick of the U.S. created a false impression on the surface, as if the U.S. was helping China to avoid the tragedy of national subjugation, but in essence, it laid a foundation for U.S. aggression. That is to say, with this policy towards China, the greater the strength of American capital, the more influential the U.S. power in China would be in the future.

Since then, U.S. aggression against China has always maintained this deceptive policy, pretending to be "generous," "friendly," and "benevolent" on the surface, but in reality, it has tried its best to use trade, finance, investment, loans, culture, religion, and other means of penetration to make China unknowingly fall under the control of the U.S. in terms of economic and political domination, even to the point of paralyzing the consciousness of the Chinese people. In this way, the U.S. would become the de facto ruler of China and become a "latecomer" among the group of imperialist nations that aggressed against China. From the beginning of the 20th century until the overthrow of the reactionary government of Chiang Kai-shek, the U.S. followed this policy, expanding its scope of aggression step by step, until it completely monopolized the dominance of the Chinese economy.

How has the United States been aggressing against China since the 20th century? We can divide it into three aspects:

First: The Shackles of Political Loans

After the beginning of the 20th century, the United States began to implement capital exports to China, but at that time, France had already occupied South China, Britain had occupied Central China, and Germany had occupied Shandong as spheres of influence. For this reason, American capital first focused on the Northeast to snipe at Tsarist Russia and Japan, which had the weakest capital strength at the time. At that time, the plan of the United States was to first support Japan in defeating Tsarist Russia in order to seize the position of Tsarist Russia. Unexpectedly, after the war, Japan began to invade the Northeast. Therefore, the United States changed from being "pro-Japanese" to being "anti-Japanese," creating a tense atmosphere between Japan and the United States for a time. It was not until the Root-Takahira Agreement of 1908 that this atmosphere was eased. At this time, the United States focused on winning the favor of the Qing government and the Chinese bourgeoisie, abandoning the Boxer Indemnity, abandoning the obtained right to lay the Ao-Han Railway, and attacking other imperialists, advocating Sino-American economic and cultural cooperation, etc. On the other hand, it also planned a series of investment plans. Although these plans were opposed and destroyed by Japan and Russia, it finally obtained the right to a 100 million yuan "currency system industrial loan" in 1910. However, at that time, China was on the eve of the revolution, and the United States was deeply aware of the danger of lending alone. It used various methods to seduce the British, German, and French banks, which were conducting the Ao-Han Railway loan at the time, to form the four major consortia (UK: HSBC; France: Banque de l'Indochine; Germany: Deutsch-Asiatische Bank; US: J.P. Morgan & Co.) of the currency system industrial loan in April 1911, with tobacco and alcohol tax, salt tax surcharge, and production and consumption taxes in the three eastern provinces as collateral. This vicious high-interest loan group was the so-called four-nation loan consortium headed by the United States. The loan, from its intended use, can be seen to be mainly aimed at the invasion of the three eastern provinces. Before long, the Qing government was overthrown, and the United States only took out 4 million yuan of this 100 million yuan, and this 4 million yuan was recovered with interest in the subsequent five-nation loan.

After Yuan Shikai, the thief of the nation, took office as president in 1912, the six-nation banking group of Britain, France, Germany, Japan, and Tsarist Russia, headed by the United States again, signed the "Post-Reorganization Loan Agreement." The main purpose of this high-interest loan group was to plunder China's financial dominance and achieve the goal of directly enslaving the Chinese people. Unexpectedly, after the establishment of this agreement, the United States withdrew from the banking group because it could not obtain a seat in China's financial supervision, violating its original purpose of aggression. At the same time, because the Democratic Party was in power at that time replacing the Republican Party, the interests it represented were more industrial capital than financial capital. Therefore, it declared in the same year that the loan conditions violated American policy and suddenly withdrew from the syndicate, making the six-nation consortium a five-nation consortium.

Although the U.S. withdrew from the six-nation consortium under beautiful diplomatic rhetoric, it changed its direction and vigorously supported Yuan Shikai's claim to the throne, granting a large amount of loans. Before long, World War I broke out, and China suddenly became Japan's exclusive stage for aggression. The United States remained silent for four years because it had no time to attend to the East. When the war ended, 36 American banks immediately drafted an investment plan for China, and the U.S. government proposed to Britain, Japan, and France the establishment of a new loan consortium to replace the old four-nation banking group. This new four-nation loan agreement was signed in New York in October 1920. The establishment of this loan group concretized the so-called "Lansing-Ishii Agreement" of 1920, acknowledging Japan's special aggressive position in China, which proved that the U.S.'s singing of "respecting China's sovereignty" was completely false.

Although the U.S. repeatedly united with various imperialists to jointly provide loans, its ultimate goal was always to dominate China. Therefore, when it could act alone, it still wanted to act alone. In 1922, the U.S. lent Wu Peifu a huge amount of money to suppress the revolution and profit from it. However, Wu Peifu collapsed soon after, and in 1926, it bought Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the revolution for 60 million yuan. Since the United States bought Chiang Kai-shek, it has gradually stepped into the period of monopolizing China. According to Remer's statistics, by 1930, the U.S.'s political loans to China had increased more than four times compared to 1914. When the Chinese people resisted Japan, it used the name of aiding China's resistance against Japan to carry out a series of loans, making China's entire financial power fall into the hands of the U.S.

From the beginning of the 20th century to 1948, the important U.S. aggressive loans to China included the following:

(A) Loans before the War of Resistance	Year	Name	Amount of Loan (USD)
	1911	Huguang Loan	7,994,165
	1916	Chicago Bank Loan	9,130,000

	1916—1921	Grand Canal Conservancy Loan	1,656,000
	1930	Education Loan	146,593
	——Various loans borrowed by Chiang Kai-shek from American merchants	11,814,922
	1936	Cotton and Wheat Loan	16,608,329

(B) Loans during the War of Resistance	Year	Name	Amount of Loan (USD)
	1938	Sino-American Tung Oil Loan	25,000,000
	1939	Sino-American Credit Loan	12,800,000
	1939	Sino-American Aircraft Loan	15,000,000
	1940	Sino-American Tin Loan	20,000,000
	1940	Sino-American Tungsten Loan	25,000,000

(C) Loans after the Victory of the War of Resistance	Year	Name	Amount of Loan (USD)
	1946	Sino-American Railway Material Purchase Loan	16,650,000
	1946	Sino-American Lend-Lease Material Takeover Contract	58,900,000
	1946	Sino-American Generator Purchase Loan	8,800,000
	1946	Sino-American Coal Mining Equipment Loan	1,500,000
	1946	Sino-American Ship Purchase Loan	2,600,000

(D) So-called "American Aid" Loans (USD)

	From 1946 to November 1947	Indo-Burma Lend-Lease Materials	780,000,000
	Export-Import Bank	84,000,000
	UNRRA (American Portion)	490,000,000
	Other	106,000,000
	Pacific Surplus Materials	800,000,000
		(Actual Value 2 Billion)
	Transporting Troops to North and Northeast China	300,000,000
	271 Warships
	130 Million Rounds of Bullets
	From November 1947 to April 1948	Congressional Loan	18,000,000
	8 Air Groups of Aircraft (1,071 Aircraft)	121,000,000
	Aircraft Parts	178,000,000
	Guam and Saipan Munitions	20,000 Tons
	50 Landing Craft
	150 Fighters
	From April 1948 to March 1949	Military Aid	125,000,000
	Economic Aid	338,000,000

Over the past fifty years, through so many loans, we have not only borne high interest rates, but also used many taxes as collateral, seized financial power, lost various important specialties, and also introduced many weapons to massacre the people to support the reactionary government. Isn't this bloody aggression?

Second: Economic Domination

In addition to political loans, U.S. aggression, exploitation, plunder, and suppression of China are also reflected in trade. The development of U.S. trade with China, just like the political loans mentioned above, has been advancing by leaps and bounds. Over the past 70 years, the situation of U.S. imports to China is shown in the following table:

Year	U.S. Imports as a Percentage of Total Amount
1870	0.58
1880	1.52
1890	2.89
1900	7.92
1910	15.46
1920	18.78
1935	19.09
1947	50.15

From the above table, it can be seen that in 70 years, the import of U.S. goods has increased more than 115 times. As for its content? Taking the situation in 1947 as an example, it is shown in the following table:

Goods Name	Percentage
Cotton	13.0
Petroleum	12.9
Metals	7.2
Machinery and Tools	7.0
Books, etc.	6.1
Chemicals	5.9
Wool and its Products	5.4
Grains	5.3
Dyes and Paints	5.2
Vehicles, etc.	4.2
Miscellaneous Metals	4.0
Tobacco	3.9
Lumber	2.9
Hemp and its Products	1.9
Other	15.1
Total	100.0

At that time, the U.S. had already achieved a monopoly in China's foreign trade, and its aggressiveness was fully demonstrated in the imported goods. The large import of U.S. cotton not only destroyed China's cotton production but also strangled the throat of China's cotton textile industry. As for petroleum, the second largest import, it was entirely supplied to the reactionary government as fuel for airplanes and automobiles to massacre the Chinese people. As for production tools such as machinery, the U.S. imports only accounted for 7%, which also shows that the U.S. is unwilling to support China's industrialization.

Looking at the goods exported from China to the U.S., they were all raw materials, mainly tung oil, bristles, mineral yarn, and metal products (mainly tungsten, iron, manganese, and zinc), which were all monopolized by the pseudo-Resources Commission under U.S. control. China exchanged such important products for some of the U.S.'s surplus consumer goods, which fully demonstrates that China's relationship with the U.S. is that of a colony to its suzerain.

In addition to trade relations, another way for the U.S. to dominate China's economy was to set up factories in China, taking advantage of China's low labor costs to exploit the blood and sweat of the Chinese working people. According to statistics in 1936, excluding the Northeast and Taiwan, U.S. industries and industrial capital in China were as follows:

Item	Number	Paid-up Capital (Thousands of USD)
Lumber and Wood Products	2	360
Machinery and Ships	10	2,772
Water, Electricity, and Gas	2	14,798
Chemicals	16	1,277
Textiles	13	915
Food, Drink, and Tobacco	9	839
Printing and Binding	2	240
Other	7	845
Total	61	22,046

Source: Wu Chengming: On the Industrial Capital of Imperialism in China

Among these many enterprises of the U.S., the most noteworthy is the electrical industry, which ranks first. Before the War of Resistance, there were 538 electrical enterprises in China, with a total power generation of 380,000 kilowatts. Among them, 476 were Chinese-owned, with a total power generation of 134,000 kilowatts. However, the power company in Shanghai alone could generate 121,000 kilowatts. Its strength can be imagined. 88% of the power purchased by various factories in Shanghai was supplied by the power company, which means that the U.S. used the supply relationship of power to strangle the throat of Shanghai's industry.

Secondly, another link in the economic aggression of the U.S. in China was the rapid development of financial capital - banks. Before 1917, there were a total of 5 U.S. banks in China. By 1920, it increased to 8. After reorganization in 1925, there were still 6, with 28 branches. The details are:

Bank Name	Unit	Capital Amount
Citibank	USD	124,000,000
American Express Bank	USD	6,000,000
Chase Bank	USD	5,000,000
American Feng Bank	Silver Yuan	3,895,503
American Xinji Bank	Silver Yuan	675,659
American Allied Bank	Silver Yuan	500,000

These banks mainly disrupted China's monetary finance by absorbing deposits and issuing banknotes, sucking the marrow and blood of the Chinese people; manipulated foreign exchange rates and exported foreign currency and banknotes, controlling China's monetary finance; invested deposits in various enterprise departments, carried out direct investment, and further controlled and manipulated China's politics through various political loans. In particular, the various loans of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary government were all processed through American commercial banks.

Third: "Cultural" Domination

Although the U.S. was later than other imperialist countries in political and economic aggression, it took the lead in so-called "cultural" domination. The U.S. first used the Boxer Indemnity to fund Chinese students studying in the U.S., and also anesthetized a part of the Chinese people through methods such as running schools, churches, and news media in China. The following table shows the situation of American "cultural" undertakings in China in 1926: (Unit: Number of Institutions)

Region	Schools	Churches	Hospitals	Propaganda Organizations	Other
North China	88	70	18	12	11
Central China	154	626	53	4	——
South China	256	308	21	2	——

According to Remer's statistics, the U.S. investment in this area was 5 million U.S. dollars in 1900, 10 million U.S. dollars in 1914, and increased to 43 million U.S. dollars by 1930. These U.S. schools were intended to educate Chinese people for their own interests; the churches wanted to use religion to achieve their own propaganda; as for the newspapers, they wanted to use deception to protect their own interests. None of them were not important tools of aggression.

For a hundred years, the cunning U.S. has invaded China with a hypocritical mask. Especially after the defeat of Japanese imperialism, when it thought it could include China and realize its beautiful dream, unexpectedly the power of the Chinese people has risen. The results of U.S. aggression in China for a hundred years have been kicked out of the mainland by the Chinese people. This is the most distressing thing for the U.S., and it is also a thing it cannot accept. It will inevitably continue to think about coming to the mainland again to realize its beautiful dream. The war of aggression against Korea is an attempt to re-enter the Asian continent, on the one hand, to complete its anti-Soviet and anti-people conspiracy, and on the other hand, to complete its ambition to once again aggress against China and enslave the Chinese people. We must not only be vigilant, but also use our strength to defeat it!

　　美帝怎样在经济上侵略中国？
　　孙怀仁
    在一群对中国侵略的帝国主义国家中，日本可以说是做得最“穷形极相”，而美国则可以说是最“口蜜腹剑”，因此，提起了日本帝国主义，大家都会敌忾同仇，可是提起了美国帝国主义，还有些人会对它存着幻想的。
    实际上，从一八四四年美国迫使清廷缔结了第一次中美不平等条约，确立起“领事裁判权”的原则以来，对中国的侵略，已经有了一百多年的历史，但它却很狡猾的既不在中国抢什么租借地，也不要什么势力范围，也不怎样的要求利权，有时候倒还装着很公平，很同情的样子在中国出场。这种狡猾作风，正是美国帝国主义的特征。美帝之所以采取这种手法，并不是说美帝讲什么仁慈，恰恰相反，正说明了美帝是一个特别阴险的侵略国。
    在十九世纪九十年代以前，美国资本主义还正在成长壮大的阶段，因此，在力量上还远不及英法等先进资本主义国家；就以地理的关系上讲，它也不及日本距中国之近。所以，在这个阶段中，它始终不能与其他帝国主义并肩的在华分割势力范围与争夺利权。及至一八九八年，这正是各帝国主义在中国争霸最激烈的时候，美国却在与西班牙作战，争夺菲律宾。这个米西战争（一八九八年四月——十二月），一方面完全证实了美国已经暴露出了帝国主义的面目，另一方面，却因此次战争，而失去了美帝在华“分赃”的机会。不过，当时美国在中国的利害关系，主要的是在贸易方面，尤其在中日战争后的数年中，美国的对华贸易已在急速发展。一八八○年由中国的输入约二千二百万美元，对中国的输出仅百万美元左右，但一八九○年的输入约一千六百二十五万美元，而输出则已达三百万美元。其后输出更激急增大，一九○○年输入约二千七百万美元，输出则为一千五百万美元，十年中飞跃了五倍，到一九○二年时，输出更超过了输入。
    所以，美帝当时因鉴于在华的利权竞争，既已落于人后，而且又无法可以再能下手，于是为保持自己既得的贸易利益起见，乐得做一个“顺水人情”装出一个“卫道者”的面目，于一八九九年八月照会各国：“反对”瓜分中国；原则的否定“势力范围”；主张“门户开放政策”。美帝的这一手把戏，在表面上造成了一种假象，好象美帝是帮助了中国，使中国免于亡国的惨祸，可是在实际的本质上，却是替美帝自己打下了一个侵略的基础，就是说，有了这个对华政策以后，只要美国资本的实力愈大，那末，今后在中国的美帝势力，就愈能举足重轻的。
    自是以后，美帝对华的侵略，始终就维持了这个欺瞒的政策，在表面上尽装着“大度”、“友好”、“仁慈”的伪装，可是在实际上，它尽可能的用贸易、金融、投资、借款、文化、宗教等的渗透作用，使中国在不知不觉中，把经济和政治的支配权，都落入到了美帝的掌握之中，甚至于使中国人的意识，也发生了麻痹。这样，美帝便会成为中国事实上的统治者，而在一群侵略中国的帝国主义国家中，成为了“后来居上”。从二十世纪开头，一直到蒋介石反动政府颠覆为止，美帝就依照这个政策执行，一步一步的扩大了它的侵略范围，终至于完全独占了中国经济的支配权。
    从二十世纪以来，美国是怎样侵略中国的呢？我们可以分成三方面来说：
            第一：政治借款的桎梏
    美帝从二十世纪初头以后，开始对中国实行资本输出，但其时法已占华南，英已占华中，德已占山东为势力范围，为此，美国资本首先就着眼到东北，以狙击当时资本力最弱的帝俄与日本。当时美帝的计划，是先支持日本战败帝俄，以图夺取帝俄的地位，不料日本在战后，却开始了侵略东北，于是，美帝便变更“亲日”而为“反日”，一时造成日美空气的紧张，及至一九○八年高平卢特协约，才把此雰围缓和了下来。这时，美帝就专注力于博取清廷及中国资产阶级的欢心，放弃庚子赔款，放弃已得的奥汉路敷设权，并攻击其他帝国主义，高唱中美经济文化的协力等等。另一方面，又策划了一连串的投资计划，这些计划虽都遭日俄之反对而破坏，但于一九一○年始终获得了一亿元的“币制实业借款”权。不过当时的中国，已在革命前夕，美帝又深感单独贷款的危险，就以种种方法，勾诱当时正在进行奥汉铁道借款的英德法银行围，在一九一一年四月，成立了四大财团（英：汇丰银行；法：东方汇理银行；德：德华银行；美：摩根公司）的币制实业借款，以烟酒税、盐税附加税及东三省生产税和消费税为担保。这个恶辣的高利贷团，就是以美帝为首的所谓四国借款团。这个借款，从它的用途规定上，可以看出其主要目的是侵略东三省的。未几，清廷颠覆，美国的这一亿元，也就只拿出了四百万元，而这四百万元，就在以后的五国借款中连本带利都取回去了。
    一九一二年窃国大盗袁世凯就任大总统以后，又再以美帝为首，成立了英、法、德、日、帝俄的六国银行团，签订了“善后大借款协定”，这个高利贷团的主要目的是要掠取中国的财政支配权，达到直接奴役中国人民之目的的。不料在这个协定成立以后，美帝因不能取得中国财政监督的席位，违反了它原来侵略的目的，同时，因为美国当时正是民主党代共和党起来执政，它所代表的利益，与其说是金融资本，无宁说是产业资本，因此，它就于同年扬言借款条件有背美国政策，而突然退出银团，使六国财团成为五国财团。
    美帝在美妙的外交辞令下，虽然脱出了六国财团，但它就变更方向，来极力支持袁世凯称帝，给予大量借款。未几世界大战爆发，中国突变为日本的独占侵略舞台，美帝以无暇东顾，暂时沉默了四年。到大战结束，美银行三十六家又立刻拟就对中国的投资计划，由美政府向英、日、法三国提出了成立一新借款团，以替代旧四国银团。这新四国借款协定，在一九二○年十月于纽约签字，这个借款团的成立，就具体化了所谓一九二○年的“蓝辛石井协定”，承认了日本在中国享有特殊侵略地位，这证明美帝所唱“尊重中国主权”的完全虚伪。
    美帝虽一再联合各帝国主义来共同借款，但它最终的目的，总是要独霸中国，因此可以单独行动时，它还是要单独行动的。一九二二年美帝就以巨额借款，贷予吴佩孚，以镇压革命，借以从中取利。可是吴佩孚不旋踵而垮台，它就于一九二六年，以六千万元收买了蒋介石背叛革命。美帝自从收买了蒋介石以后，也就逐渐的踏入了独占中国的时期。据雷麦的统计，到一九三○年止，美帝对华的政治借款，已较一九一四年暴增了四倍以上。当中国人民抗战的时候，更利用了援华抗日的名义，举行了一连串的借款，使中国整个的财政权，都落入于美帝的掌握之中了。

    五十年来，通过了这许多的借款，我们不但负担了高利；并且以许多租税作为担保，被攫夺了财政权；还丧失了各种重要的特产，同时，更还进来了很多屠杀人民的武器，以扶植反动政府。这不是血淋淋的侵略吗？
        第二：经济的支配
    美帝对中国之侵略、榨取、收夺及抑压，除掉用政治借款的方式以外，也还反映在贸易上。美帝对华贸易的发展，正如前述政治借款的情形一样，是大踏步向前推进的。七十余年来，美帝向中国输入的情形，有如下表：年    份              美帝输入在总额中所占的百分率一八七○  ○·五八一八八○  一·五二一八九○  二·八九一九○○  七·九二一九一○  一五·四六一九二○  一八·七八一九三五  一九·○九一九四七  五○·一五
    从上表，可知在七十年中，美帝货物之进口，已增加了一百十五倍以上。至于它的内容呢？以一九四七年的情形来讲，有如次表：
              货物名                              百分比
              棉花                                １３．０
              石油                                １２．９
              金属                                ７．２
              机器及工具                          ７．０
              书籍等                              ６．１
              化学品                              ５．９
              毛及其制品                          ５．４
              杂粮                                ５．３
              染料漆等                            ５．２
              车辆等                              ４．２
              杂金属                              ４．０
              烟草                                ３．９
              木材                                ２．９
              麻及其制品                          １．９
              其他                                １５．１
              共计                                １００．０
    当时美帝在中国对外贸易上，已经取得了独占的地位，而且在进口货上面，也充分表现了它的侵略性。美棉的大量进口，不但毁坏了中国的棉产，而且扼住了中国棉纺业的咽喉。至于第二种大宗进口的石油，那完全是供给反动政府，作飞机汽车燃料，来屠杀中国人民的。至于机器等的生产工具，美国的进口仅占七％，这也说明了美帝是不愿意来扶植中国工业化的。
    再就中国输美的货品来说，都是原料品，主要的是桐油，猪鬃，矿纱及金属品（以钨、铁、锰、锌四种为主），这些都是在美帝控制下的伪资委会所垄断的东西。中国以这样重要的物产，交换了一些美国过剩的消费品，这正充分表明了中国对美国是殖民地对于宗主国的关系。
    美帝在华之经济的支配，除掉通过贸易关系以外，还以在华就地设厂的方式，利用中国低廉劳动力以榨取中国劳动人民的血汗。根据一九三六年时的统计，除东北及台湾外，美帝在华的工业和工业资本，有如次表：项目               家数            实缴资本（千美元）木材及木制品   ２   ３６０机器车船  １０  ２，７７２水电煤气   ２   １４，７９８化学 　１６   １，２７７纺织  １３   ９１５饮食烟草  ９   ８３９印刷及装订   ２   ２４０其他   ７   ８４５总计  ６１   ２２，０４６
    材料来源：吴承明：关于帝国主义在华工业资本
    在美帝这许多企业中，最值得注意的，是占首位的电气事业。在抗战前，中国电气事业共五百三十八家，共发电三十八万千瓦，其中华资四百七十六家，共发电十三万四千千瓦，可是美国在上海的一个电力公司，即可发十二万一千千瓦，其力量之大，当不难想象。上海各种工厂所购的动力电，就有八八％是仰给于电力公司的，这也就是说美帝利用了动力的供给关系，扼住了上海工业的咽喉。
    再次，美帝在华经济侵略的又一个环节，是金融资本——银行的迅速发展。在一九一七年前，美国在华银行共五家，到一九二○年增至八家，到一九二五年经整理后，尚存六家，而分行达二十八家。其内容是：银行名                  单位                资        本额花旗银行  美元  一二四、○○○、○○○美国通运银行  美元  六、○○○、○○○大通银行  美元   五、○○○、○○○美丰银行  银元   三、八九五、五○三美国信济银行  银元  六七五、六五九友邦银行  银元  五○○、○○○
    这些银行，主要的通过吸收存款和发行纸币，破坏中国的货币金融，吮吸中国人民的膏血；操纵外汇行市和输出外币、外钞，控制中国的货币金融；把存款又投资到各地企业部门，进行了直接的投资，并且，更进一步通过各种政治贷款，支配操纵了中国的政治。尤其是蒋介石反动政府的各种借款，都是经过美商银行的。
            第三：“文化的”支配
    美帝在政治的经济的侵略上，虽较迟于其他帝国主义国家，但在所谓“文化的”支配上，它是着先鞭的。美帝首先以庚子赔款，充作中国留美学生的费用，同时，又通过了在中国举办学校、教会、新闻等的方法，麻醉一部分中国人民。下面的这张表，还是一九二六年时美国在华“文化”事业的情形：（单位：所）地区        学校        教会      病院      宣传机关      其他华北        八八        七○      一八        一二        一一华中        一五四      六二六    五三        四          ——华南        二五六      三○八    二一        二          ——
    美帝在这方面的投资，据雷麦的统计，一九○○年为五百万美元，一九一四年为一千万美元，到一九三○年时，已经增加到四千三百万美元了。这些美帝的学校，它的用意是在为自己的利益，教育中国人，教会，是想利用宗教来达到宣传自己；至于报纸，则想用欺瞒的方法拥护自己的利益，无一而非侵略的重要工具。
    狡猾的美帝，一百年来就这样带着伪善的假面，侵略了中国。尤其在日本帝国主义打倒以后，它满以为可以囊括中国，而圆其好梦的时候，不料中国人民的力量已抬头了，美帝百年来在华侵略的成果，竟被中国人民一脚踢出了大陆。这在美帝是一件最伤感的事，而且，也是一件不能甘心的事。它必然继续不断的要想再来大陆，重圆好梦。侵朝的战事，就是企图重新进入亚洲大陆，一方面完成其反苏反人民的阴谋，另一方面完成其再度侵略中国和奴役中国人民的野心。我们不但要警惕，而且要拿出力量来击败它！
