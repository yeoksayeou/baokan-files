　　Beijing Library Displays Current Affairs Books, Hoping Readers Will Come to Read and Reference

　　The Beijing Library, located in Toufa Hutong, Xuanwumen, in order to cooperate with the Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend the Homeland movement, and to make it easier for the masses to understand the aggressive schemes of American imperialism and its hideous and ugly face, has specially set up bookshelves in the main reading room to concentrate and display all books related to current affairs issues, for readers to read and reference.

　　In addition, it is also compiling a catalog and index of reference materials related to Resist America, Aid Korea, and Defend the Homeland, hoping that readers will come to the library to read and reference.
