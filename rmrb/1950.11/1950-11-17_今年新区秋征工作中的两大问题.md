　　Two Major Problems in This Year's Autumn Grain Collection Work in New Districts
　　Peng Xiaofan
　　The autumn grain collection work in newly liberated areas has now been widely launched. Thanks to the experience of the past year, the recent rectification movement, and the importance attached to agricultural tax by governments at all levels, past deviations and errors have been greatly reduced. However, some cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of policies or do not pay attention to their implementation. As a result, some new deviations have occurred in the initial stage of the autumn grain collection work. The more important of these are as follows:

　　I. Average Allocation of Tasks. The previously announced total tax rate of 13 percent refers to the proportion of national public grain in the total national agricultural income. It only applies as a criterion for task allocation within the scope of some large administrative regions. If provinces, especially counties and townships, all use 13 percent as the standard and implement task allocation on a level-by-level average basis, the result will inevitably be disproportionate burdens. Taking the two typical examples of Jindian Village in Jinhua, Zhejiang, and Changsheng Township in Ba County, Sichuan, the population, land, and output of the two villages are about the same, with an average income of about 700 jin per person. However, because land is concentrated and there is more rented land in Changsheng Township, the total tax of the village accounts for 22 percent of the total output; in Jindian Village, because land is scattered and there is more self-cultivated land, the total tax of the village only accounts for 12 percent of the total output. In this case, if both villages are assigned tasks based on 13 percent of the normal annual output, it will be difficult for Jindian Village to complete the task, while Changsheng Township will greatly exceed the task. It can be seen that the 13 percent tax rate can only be used as a reference for task allocation. The truly fair and reasonable principle is that those with higher incomes should bear more, those with lower incomes should bear less, and those with no income or too little income should not bear any.

　　At present, some new areas often overlook this point, resulting in the so-called "fixed task, flexible tax rate" and "tax rate obeys task" erroneous slogans. This means that the task must be completed, and only completion is sought, but the tax rate can be changed arbitrarily. According to a survey, in Limu Township of a certain county in a certain province, Shi Qingyong, a rich peasant, should have been taxed 6,142 jin according to the rate, but the actual tax collected was only 4,600 jin, accounting for 75 percent of the former, a reduction of 25 percent; Wang Maolin, a middle peasant, should have been taxed 1,128 jin according to the rate, but the actual tax collected was only 576 jin, accounting for 51 percent of the former, a reduction of 49 percent; Chen Maosheng, a poor peasant, should have been taxed 309 jin according to the rate, but the actual tax collected was only 50 jin, accounting for 16 percent of the former, a reduction of 84 percent. These are all examples of seeking only to complete the task regardless of the applicable tax rate. In addition, land output is underestimated to reduce collection, or the tax threshold is raised to reduce the burden. According to a survey, the burden coverage in a certain province is generally between 70 and 80 percent, while the actual burden coverage in Baiye Township, Jinggang District of the province, is only 40 percent. Even if the task can be completed smoothly, it is still a violation of the policy, because the actual burden in these areas is too light, which is contrary to the principle of fairness. On the other hand, in areas where land is scattered and barren, if the "fixed task" allocated on an average of 13 percent must be completed, the burden in this area will inevitably feel relatively disproportionate.

　　According to experiments conducted in twelve villages in several counties such as Jiaxing and Pinghu in Zhejiang, the general rule is that in villages with similar concentration and dispersion of land, the task can generally be calculated by multiplying the average agricultural income per person in the village by the prescribed tax rate and the total income of the village (for example, a village with 200 people, a total income of 160,000 jin, and an average income of 800 jin per person has a tax rate of 17 percent, that is, multiply 17 by 160,000 jin to get the village's task of 27,200 jin). In addition, the land tenancy situation in the village, "the amount of remotely owned land and entrusted land, as well as the amount of land owned by social organizations" and other factors, can be increased or decreased. The task allocated in this way is roughly close to the result of calculating the tax rate household by household. After the task is assigned to the village, the normal annual output is verified household by household, and the actual tax rate is calculated, which can basically achieve fairness and reasonableness. This is a method that can be used for reference.

　　II. Eagerness for Success, Ignoring Regulations. The fairness and rationality of the agricultural tax law must be demonstrated on the basis of correct land acreage and true output. Therefore, Vice Chairman Bo Yibo pointed out in his "Report on Adjusting Taxation Issues" at the Second Session of the First CPPCC National Committee that "in order to make the public grain work fair and reasonable, all localities must conduct an output survey and output evaluation before the autumn grain collection." However, the autumn grain collection work in some areas currently tends to ignore output evaluation and does not pay attention to investigating "concealed land," but puts forward slogans such as "evaluating and sending at the same time," "collecting grain first, adjusting later," and "evaluating the burden while mobilizing entry into storage," or launching so-called "red flag competition" methods, relying on a few activists to advocate a rush to deliver grain (there are also class-based collections). For example, on the evening when the task was assigned to Chunhua Township in the fourth district of a certain county in a certain province, the amount of tax payable by each household was not calculated, and it was immediately collected, and most of it was put into storage. Hexin Township in the second district of a certain county completed the task in two days using a challenge method. Such hasty and sloppy work is prone to violating the method of calculating the tax rate and is extremely difficult to be fair and reasonable.

　　Secondly, some areas do not start from actively publicizing policies, mobilizing the masses, conducting in-depth investigations and research, and creating conditions for implementing policies, but excessively emphasize that various conditions are insufficient and easily change important provisions in the agricultural tax regulations. For example, Article 15 stipulates that the method of converting the income of landlords and tenants by adding 20 percent and subtracting 20 percent according to the nature of the income has been cancelled. Instead, it has been changed to the effect that all land that is not temporarily paying rent will be taxed at 20 percent of the normal annual output (including local surcharges) and paid by the tenant in advance. When the rent is paid, the tax payable by the landlord will be deducted from the rent payable. In the amount of tax payable on the land, the portion payable by the tenant is calculated at 9 percent after discounting the tenant's income after rent reduction by 80 percent, and the rest is the portion payable by the landlord. This not only violates the provisions of calculating the tax rate, but also does not conform to the burden policy. The following examples illustrate this:

　　Example 1: The ratio of landlord-tenant sharing is 37.5 and 62.5. The normal annual output of a certain place is 100 jin, and the landlord and tenant share 20 jin, with the landlord's income calculated at 37.5 jin and the tenant's income calculated at 62.5 jin. Then the tenant's burden is 4.5 jin (62.5×80%×9%=4.5 jin), accounting for 7.2 percent of the income; the landlord's burden is 15.5 jin (20-4.5=15.5 jin), accounting for 41.33 percent of the income.

　　Example 2: The ratio of landlord-tenant sharing is 3 and 7. The normal annual output of a certain place is still 100 jin, and the landlord and tenant share 20 jin, with the landlord's income calculated at 30 jin and the tenant's income calculated at 70 jin. Then the tenant's burden is 5.04 jin (70×80%×9%=5.04 jin), accounting for 7.2 percent of the income; the landlord's burden is 14.96 jin (formula is 20-5.04=14.96 jin), accounting for 49.66 percent of the income.

　　From the above two examples, it can be seen that the landlord with an income of 37.5 percent of the normal annual output bears a lighter burden than the landlord with an income of 30 percent. This means that landlords with higher rent income have a lighter burden, while landlords with lower rent income have a heavier burden. The income of tenants is uniformly taxed at 7.2 percent, regardless of the total amount of the tenant's income. As a result, large tenants will benefit, while small tenants will be relatively disadvantaged.

　　Furthermore, the rent reduction regulations stipulate that regardless of the amount of rent, rent is reduced by 25 percent. If the rent is still higher than 37.5 percent after the reduction, it should be calculated at 37.5 percent. In this way, some landlords may have rents as low as 20 percent, that is, the landlord accounts for 20 percent and the tenant accounts for 80 percent. Taking this as an example, suppose the normal annual output of a certain place is still 100 jin, the landlord's income is 20 jin, the tenant's income is 80 jin, and the landlord and tenant share 20 jin. Then the tenant's burden is 5.76 jin (80×80%×9%=5.76 jin), accounting for 7.2 percent of the income as in the previous example; the landlord's burden is 14.26 jin (formula is 20-5.76=14.26 jin), accounting for 71.3 percent of the income, exceeding the landlord's maximum actual burden limit of 50.4 percent. This result more prominently illustrates the unreasonable phenomenon that large landlords with high rent amounts pay less tax, while small landlords with low rent amounts pay more tax. Even if the landlord's income is 37.5 percent after rent reduction according to the rent reduction regulations, according to the above example, regardless of the size of the landlord and the amount of rent income, taxing uniformly at 41.33 percent will also cause a disproportionate burden between large and small landlords.

　　III. Deviation in Output Calculation. Each class has its own ability to bear the burden, and it is necessary to have roughly separate regulations to ensure fair and reasonable burden. However, the main criteria must be determined by the level of land output or the amount of income. If the basis of output is abandoned, it is tantamount to class-based collection, which will inevitably lead to great errors. Therefore, Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas stipulates that the calculation of agricultural income should be based on the normal annual output of the land. However, land products in some areas in the south are divided into primary and secondary products. Secondary products (i.e., other grains other than those used to pay land rent) are entirely owned by the tenant, and the landlord only receives a portion of the primary products. In this way, the landlord's income should be taxed according to the normal annual output of the primary products in order to be reasonable and legal. However, in some areas, the normal annual output of primary and secondary products is calculated according to the agreed-upon share between the landlord and tenant; in some areas, it is calculated according to the landlord's actual income. Both of these methods are not fair and reasonable. Let's first try to calculate the former method:

　　For example, an average of 20 mu of land per person, with an output of 400 jin per mu (according to a survey, about one-quarter of every 400 jin of product is secondary product), the total output is 8,000 jin, with 6,000 jin of primary product and 2,000 jin of secondary product. If the total output is divided according to a 20/80 ratio, the landlord gets 1,600 jin, which is converted to 1,920 jin after adding 20 percent according to Article 15 of the regulations. At a tax rate of 30 percent, 576 jin must be borne, accounting for 48 percent of the actual income of 1,200 jin of primary product. From the perspective of the actual income of 1,200 jin, it is an income that general rich peasants or even middle peasants may have, but the burden is already close to the general landlord's maximum actual burden limit of 50.4 percent. Moreover, most landlords have an income of 30/70 after rent reduction, so the burden will be even heavier. Try to calculate the income according to the 30/70 ratio in the previous example: the landlord can get 2,400 jin, which is converted to 2,880 jin after adding 20 percent. At a tax rate of 38 percent, the burden is 1,094.4 jin, accounting for 60.8 percent of the actual income of primary product, exceeding the general landlord's maximum tax rate. This is obviously contrary to the government's policy. We must resolutely oppose illegal behaviors such as landlords concealing land and evading taxes, but at the same time, we should not excessively increase their burden, so as to avoid repeating the situation in the past where some landlords fled because they could not afford the burden, causing the state's public grain to fail.

　　The latter area's method, which only calculates according to the landlord's actual income, means the landlord's burden should not be too heavy, but it does not comply with the provisions of Article 6 of the regulations.

　　Looking at the current problems of autumn grain collection, the matters that should be paid attention to are roughly as follows:

　　I. Strengthen the ideological education and policy education of cadres, so that they understand the consistency of policy and tasks, and the basic spirit of reasonable burden. At the same time, they must also learn how to calculate the tax rate in accordance with the regulations, so as to reduce the difficulties and deviations that may occur in implementation.

　　II. Carry out extensive and in-depth publicity, and explain the policies clearly to the masses. After the policies are understood and mastered by the masses, they can become a powerful weapon to promote fair and reasonable burden.

　　III. Strictly abide by the provisions of Article 12 of the regulations, and governments at all levels must strictly collect taxes in accordance with the tax rates stipulated in the regulations, and must not freely increase or decrease them.

　　IV. Each province and city must formulate detailed rules for the implementation of the provisional regulations on agricultural tax in each province and city in accordance with the provisions of Article 29 of the regulations, and submit them to the people's government (or military and political committee) of the large administrative region for verification and reporting to the central government for record.

　　V. If any new liberated areas or provinces encounter difficulties in implementing the agricultural tax regulations, they must report to the central government for resolution. If it is proposed to formulate alternative methods, it must be reported to the central government for approval before implementation.

　　今年新区秋征工作中的两大问题
    彭晓帆
    新解放区秋征工作，目前已普遍展开，由于有了过去一年的经验和最近的整风运动，以及各级人民政府对农业税的重视，使过去的偏差和错误，都大大的减少了。但有些干部对政策认识不够，或不注意执行政策，因此在秋征工作初期，曾发生了一些新的偏差，其中比较重要的，有下列几种：
    一、平均分配任务。前公布百分之十三的总税率，系指国家公粮占全国农业总收入而言，仅适用于以一些大行政区为范围的任务分配准则，如果省尤其是县、乡都以百分之十三为标准，实行按级平均分配任务，结果必然发生畸轻畸重的现象。如以浙江金华的金店村和四川巴县的长生乡两个典型材料为例，该两乡村的人口、土地、产量都差不多，每人平均收入约七百斤左右，但长生乡因土地集中，出租地多，全村总税额达总产量百分之二十二；金店村因土地分散，自耕地多，全村总税额，只合总产量百分之十二。在此情况下，如果两村都按常年应产量以百分之十三分配任务，金店村便不易完成任务，长生乡则将大大超过任务。可见分配任务只能用百分之十三税率作为参考，真正公平合理的原则是多收入的多负担，少收入的少负担，无收入或收入太少的不负担。
    目前一些新区，往往忽略了这一点，结果产生所谓“死任务，活税率”，“税率服从任务”的错误口号。这即是说任务必须完成，也只求完成，但税率可以任意变动。据调查某省某县黎圫乡史庆永系富农成份，依率计征的应征额为六、一四二斤，实征仅四、六○○斤，占前者百分之七十五，少征了百分之二十五；王茂林系中农成份，依率计征的应征额为一、一二八斤，实征仅五七六斤，占前者百分之五十一，少征了百分之四九；陈茂生系贫农成份，依率计征的应征额为三○九斤，仅实征五○斤，占前者百分之一六，少征了百分之八四。这些都是只求完成任务不顾应计税率的实例。此外，或少计土地产量，以减少征收；或提高起征点，以缩小负担面。据查某省负担面一般在百分之七○至八○之间，而在该省靖港区柏叶乡的实际负担面，则仅百分之四十。这样即使能顺利完成任务，仍旧是违背政策的，因为这些区域的实际负担太轻了，有失公平的原则。另一方面在土地分散而贫瘠的地区，如果按百分之十三平均分配的“死任务”必求完成，结果这一地区的负担又必将相对的感到畸重。
    据浙江嘉兴、平湖等几个县作过十二个村的实验，大致的规律是在土地集中与分散程度相似的乡村，一般可按全村每人平均农业收入，照规定税率乘全村总收入，便可求出其任务（例如某村二百人，总收入十六万斤，每人平均收入八百斤，其税率为百分之十七，即以十七乘十六万斤，即得出该村任务为二七、二○○斤），此外再斟酌该村土地的租佃情况，“遥庄地与寄庄地的多寡以及社团所有土地的数量等因素，提高一些或降低一些。这样分配下来的任务与逐户依率计征的结果大体是比较接近的。等任务分配到村后，再逐户核定常年应产量，实际依率计征，基本上便可做到公平合理。这是可参考采用的一种办法。
    二、急于求成，忽视条例。农业税法的公平合理，必须在土地亩数正确，产量真实的基础上才能表现。所以薄一波副主任在政协一届二次全会上“关于调整税收问题的报告”中，曾指出“为了把公粮工作做到公平合理的程度，各地必须在秋征前进行一次产量调查和评产量工作”。可是，目前某些地区秋征工作，则多忽略评产量，也不注意查“瞒田”，而提出所谓“边评边送”，“先征粮，后调整”，“一面评议负担，同时动员入仓”等口号，或者发动所谓“红旗竞赛”办法，依靠少数积极分子，倡导突击交粮（也有划阶级征收的）。如某省县四区春华乡任务分配到乡的当天晚上，并未计算各户应征税额，便立刻征收，且大部入仓。某省县二区和心乡用挑战方式两天完成任务。这样急躁潦草从事，便易违背依率计征办法，也极难公平合理的。
    其次，有些地区，不从积极宣传政策、发动群众、深入调查研究、创造贯彻政策的条件出发，而过份的强调各项条件不够，轻易改变农业税条例中重要规定。如第十五条规定按收入性质不同，要求主、佃收入加二成，减二成的折算办法，都被取消了。而改为凡是暂不交租的土地，一律按常年应产量百分之二十计征（包括地方附加）由佃户先行交纳，俟交租时再从应交租额中将代地主应交纳的税额扣除。在该项土地应交税额中，佃户应交部分以减租后佃户应得收入打八折再按百分之九计算，其他便是地主应交的部分，这样不只是违反了依率计征的规定，也不符合负担政策。试举例说明之：
    第一例：主佃分益以三七·五和六二·五为比例。某地常年应产量一百斤，主佃共负担二十斤，地主收入按三七斤五计算，佃户收入按六十二斤五计算。则佃户负担为四斤五（６２．５×８０％×９％＝４．５斤），占收入百分之七·二；地主负担为十五斤五（２０—４．５＝１５．５斤），占收入百分之四十一点三三。
    第二例：主佃分益以三和七为比例。某地常年应产量仍为一百斤，主佃共负担二十斤，地主收入按三十斤计算，佃户收入按七十斤计算。则佃户负担为五斤○四（７０×８０％×９％＝５．０４斤），占收入百分之七点二；地主负担十四斤九六（公式为２０—５．０４＝１４．９６斤），占收入百分之四十九点六六。
    由上述两个例子，可看出收益为常年应产量百分之三十七点五的地主比收益百分之三十的地主负担较轻，这即是说地主收租额高的负担反轻，收租额低的负担反重。而佃户的收入则形成一律按百分之七点二征收，不顾佃户收入总额的多寡，结果必将使大佃户沾光，小佃户相对的吃亏。
    又减租条例规定，不管租额高低，一律按二五减租，减后如仍高过百分之三十七点五者，当按三十七点五计算。这样若干地主可能分租低到两成的，即地主占百分之二十，佃户占百分之八十。试以之为例计算：假设某地常年应产量仍为一百斤，地主收入为二十斤，佃户收入为八十斤，主佃共负担二十斤，则佃户负担为五斤七六（８０×８０％×９％＝５．７６斤），占收入亦如上例为百分之七点二；地主负担为十四斤二六，（公式为２０—５．７６＝１４．２６斤）占收入百分之七十一点三，超过了地主最高实际负担百分之五○·四的限度。这个结果，更可突出地说明大地主租额高的纳税轻、小地主租额低的纳税重的不合理现象。且若按减租条例减租后，地主收益即使都是百分之三十七点五，但照上举例子看，不管大小地主，收租总额的多寡，一律按百分之四十一点三三征税，也将使大小地主间的负担发生畸轻畸重的现象的。
    三、计产偏差。各阶层各有其负担能力，要求负担公平合理，必须有大致的分别规定。但主要的准则，必须决定于土地产量高低或收益多少。若舍弃了产量的根据，则无异划阶级征收，必然会发生很大的错误。所以新解放区农业税暂行条例第六条规定了农业收入的计算，以土地的常年应产量为标准。可是，土地产物在江南若干地区有正副之分，副产物（即交纳地租以外的其他粮食），全归佃户所有，地主只分得正产物的一部分。这样地主的收入，就应该按照正产物的常年应产量计征，才合理合法。但目前若干地区有以常年正副应产量按主佃协定分益成数计算的；某些地区则按地主实际收入计算的，这两种办法，都欠公平合理。兹先试算前一办法：
    例如每人平均二十亩地，每亩产量四百斤，（据调查每四百斤产物，约有副产物四分之一）共产量八千斤，计正产量六千斤，副产量二千斤，以全部产量按二八比例分益，地主得一千六百斤，依条例第十五条加二成折合为一千九百二十斤，税率百分之三十，须负担五百七十六斤，占实收入正产量一千二百斤的百分之四十八，从实际收入一千二百斤看，是一般富农、甚至中农都可能有的收入，但负担已接近一般地主实际负担最高百分之五○·四的限度。况一般地主减租后的收入以三七分益者为多，其负担因此将更重。试以前例收入按三七分益试算，地主可得二千四百斤，加二成折算为二千八百八十斤，税率百分之三十八，计负担一千零九十四斤四，占按实收入正产量百分之六十点八，超过一般地主最高税率。这样显然是有悖于政府的政策，我们对于地主瞒田、逃税等非法的行为是要坚决反对的，但同时也不应额外地加重他们的负担，致重演过去一些地主因无力负担而逃亡，使国家公粮落空的情形。
    后一地区的办法，只按地主实际收入计算，地主负担，当无过重的道理，但不符条例第六条的规定。
    总观目前秋征的毛病，而应切实注意的事项，约有下列几点：
    一、加强干部的思想教育和政策教育，使其认识政策与任务的一致性，和合理负担的基本精神。同时更要使其学会按照条例依率计征的办法，以减少执行中可能发生的困难与偏向。
    二、进行广泛而深入的宣传，将政策向群众交待清楚，政策被群众了解掌握后，即能成为推动公平合理负担的有力武器。
    三、切实遵照条例第十二条规定，各级人民政府必须严格依照条例所规定的税率计征，不得自由增加或减少。
    四、各省市必须按照条例第二十九条规定拟订各该省市农业税暂行条例施行细则，报请大行政区人民政府（或军政委员会）核报中央备案。
    五、各新解放区、省执行农业税条例，遇有困难，必须报请中央解决。如拟订变通办法，须报请中央核准，然后施行。
