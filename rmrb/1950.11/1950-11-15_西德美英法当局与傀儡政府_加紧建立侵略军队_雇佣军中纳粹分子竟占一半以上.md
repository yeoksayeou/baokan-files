　　Intensify Establishment of Aggressive Army
	More Than Half of Mercenaries are Nazis
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 14th dispatch] Although the United States has not yet been able to force its partners in the North Atlantic aggressive bloc to fully agree to openly establish a regular West German aggressive army, the West German, US, British, and French occupation authorities and the Adenauer puppet government are stepping up their secret military buildup under various guises.
	According to Agence France-Presse, Bonn: As early as after the New York meeting of the US, British, and French foreign ministers, the high commissioners of the three countries in Germany instructed Adenauer in mid-October to expand his so-called "mobile police force," which had been approved for establishment in July, to 30,000 men, a quarter of whom must be kept on constant alert. This police force will be under the unified command of a so-called "federal inspector general," and senior officers will also be appointed by the "federal government." Subsequently, the West German puppet "parliament" passed a resolution on October 26 to reorganize the "police" of the West German states and place them under the direct command of the Bonn "federal government." On October 27, Adenauer convened a meeting of the "prime ministers" and "interior ministers" of the West German states and approved the establishment of a mobile police force. At the same time, the Adenauer government also approved the establishment of a so-called "Federal Guard Group" of 1,800 people.
	In addition, according to the German News Agency, 40,000 former Nazi Wehrmacht soldiers in the British occupation zone of West Germany have recently been formed into a so-called "German Service Unit" equivalent to four divisions, led by German officers and wearing the same uniforms as the Nazi Wehrmacht. According to the British Military Command in the Rhineland, the unit began performing armed guard duties on October 31.
	The United States uses former Nazis as the backbone of all kinds of mercenary armies it organizes in West Germany. According to the German News Agency: Former German Wehrmacht soldiers account for 60 percent of the new mercenary army. The commanders of the various units are all former Hitler generals. US imperialism uses Nazis without any scruples. According to United Press reporter Wilbur: Washington "military figures believe that American and German professional soldiers can cooperate well. It is expected that the "Allies" are particularly interested in those German military personnel who served on the Eastern Front in the last war and are therefore familiar with Communist strategies and tactics."

　　西德美英法当局与傀儡政府
　  加紧建立侵略军队
    雇佣军中纳粹分子竟占一半以上
    【新华社十四日讯】美国尽管还未能逼迫它在北大西洋侵略集团内的伙伴，完全同意公开建立正规的西德侵略军，但是西德美、英、法占领当局与阿登纳傀儡政府在各种名目下暗暗建军的步骤，却正在步步加紧。
    据法新社波恩消息：早在美、英、法三外长纽约会议结束后，美、英、法三国驻德高级专员，即于十月中旬授意阿登纳将他在七月间呈准建立的所谓“机动警察部队”扩大至三万人，其中四分之一须经常保持警戒状态。这个警察部队将由一名所谓“联邦总监”统一指挥，高级军官亦须由“联邦政府”任命。接着，西德傀儡“议会”就在十月二十六日通过决议：改组西德各州的“警察”，划归波恩“联邦政府”直接指挥。而在十月二十七日，阿登纳就召集了西德各州“总理”与“内政部长”开会，通过了建立机动警察的办法。同时，阿登纳政府还批准建立了一千八百人的所谓属“联邦警卫团”。
    此外，据电通社报道：西德英占区纳粹国防军旧属四万人，新近已被编成一个相当于四个师的所谓“德国服务队”，由德国军官统率，并穿着与纳粹国防军一样的军装。据莱因区英军司令部宣布，该队已于十月三十一日起执行武装看守队的职务。
    美国在西德组织的各色雇佣军，一概以前纳粹分子为其骨干。据电通社称：在新的雇佣军中，前德国国防军士兵占百分之六十。而作为各部队指挥官的则都是前希特勒将领。美帝国主义使用纳粹分子已无所顾忌，据合众社记者韦尔伯透露：华盛顿“军界人士认为：美国和德国的职业军人们可以很好地合作。大家料想“盟国”对于那些在上次大战中曾在东线服役，因而熟悉共产党战略战术的德国军事人员，特别感到兴趣”。
