　　Xinhua News Agency, 16th Dispatch: Peace advocates from various countries are furiously condemning the British Labour government's absurd behavior in obstructing the Second World Peace Congress from being held in England. According to TASS: The French delegation participating in the Second World Peace Congress, in a letter of protest to Attlee, pointed out: We believe you bear the grave responsibility of infringing upon the people's right to discuss issues of defending peace, and you have undermined the tradition of free discussion and free debate of the British people. One hundred and thirty workers at the Vitry electrical appliance factory near Paris held a one-hour protest strike on the 10th. Steelworkers at the Renault factory and workers at other factories also expressed their protest against the British government's unreasonable behavior. The Swedish Ny Tid pointed out: The British government's anti-peace behavior has once again exposed the hypocrisy of so-called "Western democracy" to the world and shows that it has embarked on the road of launching war. The International Association of Journalists has lodged a strong protest with the British government and the British National Union of Journalists, condemning the British government's refusal to issue entry visas to most representatives and journalists attending the Peace Congress. The Bulgarian Peace Committee held a press conference in Sofia on the 14th, condemning the British government's refusal to issue entry visas to the Bulgarian representatives attending the Peace Congress.
　　According to a Dentsu News Agency dispatch: The three church representatives from Hungary who were refused entry into the UK by the British government to attend the Peace Congress have all published strong protests in newspapers. The British Peace Committee has continuously received letters of protest from the British people, and many protest meetings have been held across the country.
