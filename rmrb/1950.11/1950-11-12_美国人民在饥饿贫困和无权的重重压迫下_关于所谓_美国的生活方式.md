The American People Under the Multiple Oppressions of Hunger, Poverty, and Lack of Rights
On the So-Called "American Way of Life"
Soviet Union, Gao Erniev

Lenin once pointed out that American imperialism is the most reactionary and violent imperialism that strangles small nations and revives reactionary forces throughout the world.

		“Peace-Loving” America Has Waged 114 Wars in 130 Years

These words were spoken many years ago. Today, American imperialism has further exposed its beastly nature, desperately seeking world hegemony. Nevertheless, bourgeois historians, especially American historians, attempt to portray American imperialists as lovers of peace. Historical facts refute this argument. "Peace-loving" America waged 114 wars in 130 years (from 1775 to 1903). The masters of this country—now the monopoly capitalists, the bosses of Wall Street—emerged from each war as "victors," stuffing billions of new dollars into their pockets. Lenin wrote in "Letter to American Workers" after World War I: "The American billionaires…have profited more than all the rest. They have converted all countries into their debtors. They have grabbed the richest lands. They have increased their wealth to unprecedented proportions and are holding sway over nearly the whole world. And this wealth is besmirched with the blood and tears…for every dollar is besmirched with filth…every dollar bears traces of 'profitable' war contracts which in every country enriched the rich and ruined the poor. Every dollar is stained with the blood that flowed in torrents, out of the ten million dead and twenty million maimed…” (Collected Works of Lenin, Vol. 23, pp. 197-180).

World War II, which cost 50 million lives, was an even more lucrative war for American profiteers. The "civilized" vampires (as Lenin called the American imperialists) made countless fortunes on the blood of the people.

"Peace-loving" America has now become the center of world aggression, reaction, and darkness. Reaction and chauvinism, manifested in both foreign and domestic policies, are the hallmarks of modern predatory American imperialism. The policy of the American ruling clique is a fascist policy of seizing world hegemony. To achieve this policy, they implement military strategic measures, exert political pressure and intimidation, and carry out economic expansion and enslavement of other nations.

The ferocious face of American imperialism is fully exposed in its open aggression against the freedom-loving Korean people and the people of other Asian countries. Suppressing democratic order with military force, massacring unarmed women, children, and the elderly, bombing peaceful cities and villages—all these have become the specialties of American imperialists.

To achieve the goal of seizing world hegemony, American imperialists simultaneously employ weapons to spiritually enslave the masses. Bourgeois entrepreneurs and exploiters—all those people unified under the general concept of the "American ruling clique"—are creating this reputation for their country: "A country where everyone has the same opportunity to get rich," "the richest country in the world"... Boasting and baseless praise have reached unprecedented heights in the United States. To poison the consciousness of the American middle class, newspapers, movies, and national leaders everywhere tout the unique advantages of the United States. This hypocritical propaganda, along with cannons and canned horse meat, is an item exported to Marshall Plan countries.

What is the "American way of life" so loudly touted by the bourgeois press actually like? Does life in this country match what is written on the signboard? The reality of events in America itself provides the best affirmative answer to this question.

		Happiness for a Select Few, Poverty for the Broad Masses of Working People

The United States is the wealthiest of all capitalist countries. However, wealth is only for a select few. The average American family, barely scraping by before the war, needed an annual income of at least $2,500. Now, when retail prices are more than double what they were before the war, such a family needs an annual income of $5,300 just to make ends meet. Official American statistics reduce this figure to $4,111. Even so, even if one could barely live on such a budget, how do the 26 million families (more than 70% of all American families), each with an income below the prescribed standard, that is, an annual income of less than $4,000, live? It should be noted that they cannot meet the most frugal living requirements of their families. Only 10% of American families have an income of $4,000 a year, living half-starved according to the so-called "American way of life."

In contrast, 3% of American families have an annual income of more than $7,500 each. Eighty-seven families and individuals with a total annual income of $157 million are also among these 3% of "happy" families. More than 44,000 families and individuals with the highest incomes generally earn more than $300 million a year, a figure that is $100 million more than the wages received by 7.6 million Americans, each of whom earns an average of less than $500 a year.

According to the assertions of American imperialists and their running dogs, all Americans can live perfectly well in the United States. However, the above figures show that the basic working masses of the United States do not even have the possibility of meeting their minimum consumption needs. Only the uppermost stratum of American society, a small handful of exploiters and their parasitic servants, can enjoy a full and happy life.

Life requires not only food and clothing, but also the most basic living conditions. However, in the United States, these living conditions are not available to the working people. The homes of 4.6 million American workers and employees are dilapidated and in need of immediate repair, and the eight million homes in the so-called slums must all be demolished because they can no longer be repaired. To meet even half of the housing needs, 16.1 million new homes must be built.

In the United States, it is not uncommon for families with many children to be driven into the streets. No one is surprised to see people living in carts; American workers travel with their families in carts, looking for work.

		National Health Care Costs Only One-Thirtieth of Military Expenditure

The wealthiest country in the capitalist world has no national social insurance for illness. In the American budget, the money used for national health care needs accounts for less than 3% (that is, 25 to 30 times less than the cost of preparing for a new war). Of the total expenditure on health care, only 13% to 15% is paid by the state, while the other 85% is paid by the residents themselves.

In the United States, medical treatment must be paid for in cash, and medical expenses are very high (at least $12 a day in the hospital, and more than $500 for a surgical operation).

This health care "system" has an extremely harmful impact on the health of the working masses. Even according to official materials, approximately 80% of all American citizens who are drafted into the army and undergo physical examinations have some kind of illness. 40% of all draftees are rejected for poor health, and 12% suffer from mental illness. 25 million American citizens suffer from chronic diseases, of which only a negligible few have the possibility of receiving medical treatment.

The current state of national education in the United States presents an even more tragic picture. In a country where everything is subject to one slogan, namely, the more dollars the better, the situation of schools is unspeakable. Look! The result is this: In the United States, 6 million children (one-fifth of all school-age children) cannot go to school. The number of illiterate adults reaches 20 million.

American imperialists are not interested in national education, but only desperately try to fool the consciousness of the American people, so that they do not pay attention to the abominable facts in the United States. Newspapers, literature, and movies poison the minds of the American people every day, trying to turn Americans into capital slaves without will and completely obedient. Four-fifths of American films are promoting crime, licentiousness, and violence. The American reactionaries are cultivating a generation of people who have completely lost their moral essence, and are training misanthropic guys who are prepared to commit any crime.

		"Murder Incorporated" Prices Each Murder from $500 to $20,000.

It is no accident that the number of crimes in the United States has increased particularly rapidly in recent years. In 1948, a serious crime occurred in the United States every 18 seconds, 36 people were killed every day, and 255 women were raped. New York has a special "Murder Incorporated" composed of hired executioners. The company's pricing is as follows: the company charges $500 to kill an ordinary citizen, and $20,000 to kill a political activist.

In the United States, racial discrimination against blacks and other "colored people" is widely practiced. Blacks and other "colored people" account for more than 10% of American residents. Blacks are the last to be hired when hiring, and they do the heaviest work. They are the first to be fired when laid off. Black wages are lower than white wages. If the housing problem of millions of people in the United States has not been solved, then, when it comes to blacks, it is even more unimaginable: about two-thirds of black residents' housing does not have the necessary facilities. Blacks pay 30% more for rent than other residents. If "white" residents enjoy even formal rights to participate in elections (these rights are completely deprived by thousands of additional conditions), then blacks do not even have these completely deprived rights. If the health care cause in the United States is generally bad, then the health care cause for blacks is even worse. As a result of all these evils, the mortality rate of blacks is 50% higher than that of whites. An official American document once stated: "Blacks are sentenced to poverty because their skin is black."

In the United States, blacks can be killed without being punished. Terrorists serving the American imperialists kill thousands of innocent blacks every year in the most brutal ways. American chauvinism is no different in essence from fascist Hitler's chauvinism and extreme reactionarism.

Similar facts in American reality are too numerous to mention. For example, you can also take a look at the lives of 18 million unemployed American citizens who are living an unfortunate and miserable life with their families. You can also take a look at the other living difficulties of the American working people. But it is already very clear that in the United States, all happiness belongs to the exploiters, while ordinary people are in the most miserable situation.

		The Jackals of Wall Street Frantically Suppress Democratic and Progressive Forces

The imperialist jackals of Wall Street are doing their best to promote war psychosis at home and in other capitalist countries (which is beneficial to them, as it will make huge profits by increasing military orders). At the same time, they adopt blatant fascist methods at home to persecute all democratic and progressive forces. The despicable act committed by the American bourgeoisie, namely, the trial of the leaders of the American Communist Party, who are unswerving fighters for the interests of the American working masses, is known all over the world.

In the United States, freedom of thought is prohibited. In the United States, it is absolutely forbidden to say or even inquire about the true situation of the Soviet Union; for this, one will lose one's job, be imprisoned, or be killed by the Ku Klux Klan. In this "democratic" country, the barbaric "lynch courts" and fascist organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan and its like, such as "American Veterans Participating in Overseas Operations" and others, have full freedom of action. The American reactionary bourgeoisie has established the Federal Bureau of Investigation (secret police). This organization and all its organs are working towards turning the United States into a police state. It viciously strangles all progressive forces in the country. Other organs of the American state power also have this purpose.

The reactionary forces are carrying out a particularly frenzied attack on the American Communist Party, holding the policy of prohibiting its existence. Not long ago, the House of Representatives approved the pro-fascist Wood Act. This bill actually declares the Communist Party and various democratic organizations illegal. Now, the so-called McCarran's bill on "internal security," which is being discussed in the Senate, pursues the purpose of persecuting the progressive movement in the country.

The Taft-Hartley Act, which prohibits workers from fighting for their rights, is also a clear manifestation of the American imperialists' frantic attack on the economic and political rights of the working class. The Taft-Hartley Act permits slavery and slave labor.

After the start of the armed intervention in Korea, the process of American fascization was particularly nakedly exposed. The reactionary forces tried to consolidate the rear in order to carry out this bloody adventure. They embarked on the road of fascist terror to oppose peace advocates. The American people are deprived of their jobs and imprisoned for carrying out activities that are conducive to peace and for opposing the imperialist aggression in Korea.

		The "American Way of Life" Is a Fascist Order and National Discrimination

After pointing out all of the above, it is not difficult to believe that the so-called "American way of life" is the impoverished life of millions of working masses, and the unbelievable exploitation of their labor. The "American way of life" is the establishment of a fascist order in the United States, national discrimination, and the enslavement of other countries and their people. It, this so-called "American way of life," completely conforms to the interests of American monopoly capitalists and billionaires. The American state serves them and only them.

American imperialists are trying to move this "way of life" to all countries, but this is impossible! The working masses of all countries have understood what the "American way of life" will bring them. They are resolutely rising up against the plans of American imperialism, fighting for democracy and socialism, for the national independence of their countries, and against the danger of a new war. In this struggle, the strength of the socialist and democratic camp is developing and being tempered, and its determination and will to tear up all the evil plans of bloody American imperialism are also increasing.

　　美国人民在饥饿贫困和无权的重重压迫下    关于所谓“美国的生活方式”
    苏联　高尔涅夫
    列宁曾经指出，美帝国主义是绞杀弱小民族，复活全世界反动势力的最反动和最狂暴的帝国主义。
          “爱好和平的”美国在一百三十年内进行了一百十四次战争
    这些话是很多年以前说的。现今美帝国主义更加暴露了它的野兽般的本性，拼命地夺取世界霸权。虽然如此，资产阶级的历史家，尤其是美国的历史家们却企图把美帝国主义者描写成为和平的爱好者。历史的事实推翻了这种论断。“爱好和平的”美国在一百三十年内（从一七七五年至一九○三年），进行了一百一十四次战争。这一国家的主人——现在就是垄断资本家、华尔街的老板，——以“胜利者”的姿态走出了历次的战争，把数十亿新的美元装进了自己的口袋。列宁在第一次世界大战后，在“致美国工人的信”中写道：“美国的亿万巨富们……掠夺到了数千亿美元。而每一美元上都呈现着污秽的痕迹……每一美元上，都有使每一个国家的富人发财而穷人破产的“厚利的”军事定货的污斑。每一美元上都沾有一千万死者和二千万残废者所流的鲜血汇成的那一血海中的血的痕迹……”（《列宁全集》第二十三卷第一九七——一八○页）。
    以五千万人的生命为代价的第二次世界大战，对于美国的谋利专家们来说却是一次有更大收入的战争。“文明的”吸血鬼们（列宁正是这样来称呼美帝国主义者的），靠人们的鲜血来发了无数的横财。
    “爱好和平的”美国现今变成为世界侵略、反动和黑暗势力的中心。无论在对外政策上，无论在对内政策上都表现着的反动和沙文主义，这就是现代强盗式的美帝国主义的面目。美国执政集团的政策，就是掠夺世界霸权的法西斯政策。为实现这一政策，他们实行着军事战略措施，实行着政治压力和恐吓，实行着经济扩张和奴役其它各国人民。
    美帝国主义的凶恶面孔，在对爱好自由的朝鲜人民和亚洲其它国家人民的公开的侵略中完全暴露出来了。用军队压制民主秩序，屠杀手无寸铁的妇女、儿童和老人，轰炸和平城市与乡村，所有这些，都成了美帝国主义者的专业。
    为了达到夺取世界霸权的目的，美帝国主义者同时采用着在思想上鱼肉群众的武器。资产阶级企业家和剥削者，——在“美国执政集团”总的概念之下统一起来的一切人们，——正在为自己的国家创造着这种荣誉：“每一个人都同样有发财机会的国家”，“世界上最富裕的国家”……。自吹自擂，毫无根据的赞美在美国达到了空前的高峰。为了达到荼毒美国中间阶层的意识的目的，报刊、电影和国家要人到处吹嘘美国的得天独厚。这一虚伪的宣传与大炮和马肉罐头同是向马歇尔化国家输出的物品。
    资产阶级刊物所大吹大擂的“美国的生活方式”实际上究竟是怎样的呢？在这一国家内的生活是否符合在招牌上所写的那种生活呢？美国的现实事件本身再好不过地对这一问题作了肯定的答复。
            幸福的是屈指可数的几个人，贫困的是广大的劳动人民
    美国是世界上各资本主义国家中最富裕的一个国家。但是，在这儿富裕的只是屈指可数的几个人。中等的美国家庭，在战前马马虎虎的凑付着过下去，一年的收入至少就要有两千五百美元。现在，当零售物价比战前高了两倍以上的时候，而这种家庭一年就要有五千三百美元的收入，才可度日。美国官方的统计却把这一数字减到四千一百一十一美元。即令是如此，即令依照这种预算能勉强地生活下去，但如果两千六百万个家庭（占美国全部家庭百分之七十以上），每一个家庭的收入低于所规定的标准，也就是一年收入不到四千美元，又怎样生活下去呢？须知他们是不能满足自己家庭最俭朴的生活要求的。只占美国家庭百分之十的家庭一年才有四千美元的收入，根据所谓“美国的生活方式”半饥半饱地生活下去。
    与此相反，占美国家庭百分之三的家庭，每家一年的收入却在七千五百美元以上。总收入一年达一万万五千七百万美元的八十七个家族和个人，也在这些占百分之三的“幸福”家庭之列。有最大收入的四万四千余个家庭和个人，一般地一年都能获得三十万万多美元，这一数字比七百六十万美国人所领的工资还要多十万万美元，而在这七百六十万美国人中每一个人的平均收入一年还不到五百美元。
    按照美帝国主义者及其走狗的断言，一切美国人都可以完全很好地生活在美国的。可是，上述数字表明了，美国的基本劳动群众甚至没有可能满足自己最低限度的消费。只是美国社会的最上层、一小撮剥削者及其寄生的奴仆才能享受全部幸福生活。
    人生所需要的不仅是食物和衣服，同时还需要最起码的居住条件。可是，在美国对劳动人民来说，这些居住条件是没有的。四百六十万美国工人和职员住的房屋都是破烂不堪的和需要马上修理的，而在所谓贫民窟里的八百万房屋都要通通拆毁，因为它们已经不能再修理了。为了满足居住需要，即令是一半也好，就必须建筑一千六百一十万座新住宅。
    在美国，多子女的家庭被赶到街上去的事件是屡见不鲜的。住在大车里谁也不感到奇怪；美国工人就是跟自己家眷一起住在大车里旅行找工作的。
            国民保健费用只及备战费用的三十分之一
    资本主义世界中最富裕的国家，在疾病时是没有国家社会保险，在美国的预算中，用于国民保健之需要的金钱，占百分之三还弱（这也就是说，比准备发动新战争的费用少二十五至三十倍）。在用于保健事业上的开支总额中，只有百分之十三至十五由国家支付，而其它百分之八十五则由居民本身支付。
    在美国看病都要付现款，同时医药费也是非常之高的（住一天医院至少也得十二美元，动一次外科手术就得花五百以上的美元）。
    这种保健“制度”极有害地影响了劳动群众的健康。甚至根据官方的材料，在应召入伍受身体检查的所有美国公民，约百分之八十不是有这种病就是有那种病。全体应召的人有百分之四十因体格不健全而被挑出来，有百分之十二患精神病。两千五百万美国公民患着慢性病，其中只有微不足道的几个人有得到医疗的可能。
    现今的美国国民教育呈现着一片更凄惨的图景。在一切都服从一个口号，即是美元越多越好的国家里，学校的情形是不堪言状的。请看！其结果就是这样：在美国有六百万儿童的（占全体学龄儿童五分之一）不能上学。成年中的文盲人数则达两千万人。
    美帝国主义者对国民教育是不感兴趣的，而只是拼命地愚弄美国人的意识，使他们不去注意美国可恶的事实。报刊、文学和电影天天毒害着美国人民的意识，极力使美国人变成无意志的和唯命是从的资本的奴隶。五分之四的美国影片都在宣扬着罪恶、淫荡和暴行。美国的反动分子正在培育完全丧失了道德本质的人们的一代，正在训练着准备犯任何罪恶的仇视人类的家伙们。
            “杀人公司”每杀一人定价自五百元至两万元。
    近几年来，美国犯罪事件特别迅速增多，也并不是偶然的。一九四八年，在美国每十八秒钟就出现一件严重的罪行，每一天要杀死三十六人，二百五十五个妇女被强奸。在纽约设有专门的由雇佣刽子手们组成的“杀人股份有限公司”。该公司的定价是这样的：杀一位普通公民，公司索取五百美元，而杀一位政治活动家要两万美元。
    在美国广泛地实行着对黑人和其它“有色种人”的种族歧视，黑人和其他“有色种人”占美国居民百分之十以上。在雇佣人的时候最后才雇黑人，同时工作最重，而在解雇的时候，最先是解雇黑人。黑人的工资低于白人。如果，在美国数百万人的居住问题没得到解决，那末，说到黑人，那就尤其不可想像了：约三分之二的黑人居民的住宅没有得到必需的方便条件。黑人付房费比其他居民贵百分之三十。如果“白色的”居民享有那怕是形式上的参加选举的权利（这种权利被千百个附加条件剥夺净光了），那末黑人就连这些被剥夺净光的权利也没有。如果，美国的保健事业一般是不好的，那末，黑人的保健事业就更是坏到极点了。由于所有这一切的恶果，黑人的死亡率比白人高百分之五十。在一个美国官方的文件中曾这样说过：“黑人因自己的皮肤是黑的，所以被判决受穷”。
    在美国，可以杀死黑人，不必受处罚。为美帝国主义者效劳的恐怖分子每年都要用最残暴的方法，杀死数千毫无罪过的黑人。美国的沙文主义按其本质而言，与法西斯希特勒的沙文主义和极端反动主义是没有毫厘之分的。
    美国现实事件中的类似事实，是不胜枚举的。例如，还可以察看一下和自己的家眷一起度着不幸的悲惨生活的一千八百万美国失业公民的生活。也可以察看一下美国劳动人民其它的生活困难。但是这样就已很明显了，在美国，一切幸福生活都是属于剥削者所有的，而普通的人们则处于最凄惨的状况之下。
            华尔街的豺狼们疯狂镇压民主和进步力量
    华尔街的帝国主义豺狼们无论在本国也好，或在其它的资本主义国家也好，都尽力鼓吹着战争的精神病（这对他们是有益的，这会由于增加军事定货而获得巨额利润）。同时，他们在国内采取露骨的法西斯方法，迫害一切民主与进步力量。美国资产阶级所干下的卑鄙行为，即是对为美国劳动群众利益而斗争的始终不渝的战士——美国共产党的领导者的审判，是全世界都知道的。
    在美国，思想自由是被禁止的。在美国，绝对禁止说甚至禁止打听关于苏联的真实情况；为此就要失去工作，就要坐狱，就要被三Ｋ党匪帮们打死。在这一“民主的”国家内，野蛮的“私刑法庭”，法西斯组织三Ｋ党及其同类，如“美国参加海外作战退役军人”和其它，却有着充分的行动自由。美国的反动资产阶级成立了联邦调查局（秘密警察）。这一组织及属于它的一切机关正在朝着把美国变成警察国的方向努力。它恶毒地绞杀着国内的一切进步力量。美国国家政权其它的机关也有着这种目的。
    反动势力抱着禁止美国共产党存在的方针，对它进行着特别疯狂的进攻。不久以前，众议院批准了亲法西斯的伍德法案。这一法案实际上就是宣布共产党和各种民主组织为非法。现在，正在参议院讨论的所谓麦卡伦的关于“内部安全”的法案所追求的目的，便是迫害国内的进步运动。
    禁止工人为自己的权利而斗争的塔虎脱——哈特莱法案，也是美帝国主义者对工人阶级经济和政治权利疯狂进攻的明显表现之一。塔虎脱——哈特莱法案许可奴役和实行奴隶劳动。
    对朝鲜的武装干涉开始之后，美国法西斯化的过程特别赤裸裸地暴露出来了。反动势力力图巩固后方，以便实行这一血腥的冒险。踏上法西斯恐怖的道路，来反对和平拥护者。美国人民因进行有利于和平的活动，因反对在朝鲜的帝国主义侵略，而被剥夺工作和被监禁。
            “美国的生活方式”就是法西斯主义的秩序与民族歧视
    指出上述一切之后，就不难相信，所谓“美国的生活方式”，这就是千百万劳动群众穷困的生活，这就是难以置信的削剥他们的劳动。“美国的生活方式”，这就是在美国建立法西斯主义的秩序，这就是民族歧视，这就是奴役他国和他国人民。它，这个所谓“美国的生活方式”，完全符合美国垄断资本家和亿万巨富们的利益。美国的国家是为他们而且只是为他们服务的。
    美帝国主义者力图把这一“生活方式”也搬到一切国家去，这是办不到的！世界各国的劳动群众都已明白，“美国的生活方式”会给他们带来什么。他们正在坚决起来反对美帝国主义的计划，为民主与社会主义，为自己国家的民族独立，为反对新战争的危险而斗争。在这一斗争中，社会主义和民主阵营的力量日益发展和受到锻炼，它的撕毁血腥的美帝国主义一切凶恶计划的决心和意志也日益加强。
