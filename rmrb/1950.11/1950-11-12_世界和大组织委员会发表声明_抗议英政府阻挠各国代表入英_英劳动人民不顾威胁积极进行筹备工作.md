Xinhua News Agency, November 11th dispatch from London via TASS: The World Peace Congress Organizing Committee, at a press conference held in London on the 9th, issued a statement stating that British authorities had rescinded the agreement previously reached between the Organizing Committee and officials of the British Civil Aviation Department, and would not allow nine British aircraft and nine Czech aircraft to land in Britain carrying representatives from various countries attending the Second World Peace Congress from Prague.
	According to the latest news, British secret agents are "implementing security measures that are unprecedented in peacetime." Secret agents at various seaports have obtained a detailed "blacklist" and have been ordered to notify immigration officials not to allow those on the list to disembark.
	Montagu, Chairman of the World Peace Congress Organizing Committee, protested the British government's obstruction of the congress's work at a press conference on the 10th, stating that because the British government was not providing necessary information, it was extremely difficult for the Organizing Committee to ascertain which representatives had been granted visas and which had not. Montagu emphasized that although the British government did not formally ban the congress from being held in Britain, it was trying to sabotage the congress through "despicable administrative tyranny." However, preparations for the congress are still underway and will be successfully completed.
	Xinhua News Agency, November 11th dispatch from London via TASS: British authorities continue to violently obstruct representatives from various countries from attending the Second World Peace Congress from coming to Britain. According to the Conservative Party's "Daily Mail," the Foreign Office, following notification from the Home Office, is adopting a very tough attitude towards foreign representatives applying for entry visas, deliberately creating difficulties. A "Daily Express" reporter stated that although representatives from countries such as France and Belgium do not require entry visas, they will be subjected to strict interrogation. Orders to intensify surveillance of "dangerous reds" have been sent to all airports.
	British laboring people, regardless of various threats, are actively preparing for the Second World Peace Congress. Workers at "Thomas Clarke & Sons Ltd." in Sheffield, in order to protest the company management's refusal to allow foundry worker Crawford leave to attend the congress, have specifically organized a delegation to attend the congress. All employees of "Ambrose Shardlow & Co." in the city unanimously agreed to send representatives to the Peace Congress. Workers in many other factories that have refused to allow workers leave to attend the congress have also organized delegations to attend the congress. The threat of "sanctions" by the British Steel Corporation in Manchester against miners attending the congress has aroused great anger among the workers in the city, and the shop workers' union held a mass meeting to protest.

　　世界和大组织委员会发表声明
    抗议英政府阻挠各国代表入英
    英劳动人民不顾威胁积极进行筹备工作
    【新华社十一日讯】综合塔斯社伦敦讯：世界保卫和平大会组织委员会，于九日在伦敦举行的招待记者会上发表声明称：英国当局已撤销组织委员会与英国民用航空部官员先前所达成的协议，不许九架英国飞机及九架捷克飞机由布拉格载搭各国出席第二届世界保卫和平大会的代表在英国着陆。
    据最新消息，英国的秘密特务人员“在和平时期破例地实行着治安措施”。各海港的特务人员已获得一份详尽的“黑名单”，并奉命通知管理外侨入境的官员，不许那些列入名单的人们登岸。
    世界保卫和平大会组织委员会主席蒙塔古，在十日招待记者会上抗议英国政府阻挠大会工作的行为称：由于英国政府不供给必要的消息，因此组织委员会要确知那些代表已获签证、那些未获签证的，是极其困难的。蒙塔古强调称：英国政府虽然不正式禁止大会在英国举行，却力图以“卑劣的行政上的暴虐手段”来破坏大会。然而大会的筹备工作仍在进行中，并将胜利地完成。
    【新华社十一日讯】综合塔斯社伦敦讯：英国当局继续横暴地阻挠各国出席第二届世界保卫和平大会的代表前来英国。据保守党“每日邮报”报道，外交部按照内政部的通知，对申请入境签证的外国代表们，采取非常强硬的留难态度。“每日快报”记者称：法国和比利时等国的代表虽然不需要入境签证，但他们将受到严格的盘查，加紧监视“危险赤色分子”的命令，已经送达各航空站。
    英国劳动人民不顾各种威胁，正在积极筹备第二届世界保卫和平大会。设菲尔德的“托马斯·克拉克父子有限公司”的工人们，为了抗议该公司经理部不准铸造工人克劳福特请假出席大会，已专门组织了一个出席大会的代表团。该城“安布罗斯·萨尔德洛斯公司”的全体员工，一致同意推派代表出席和平大会。其他许多不准工人请假出席大会的工厂的工人，也纷纷组织了参加大会的代表团。曼彻斯特的英国炼钢公司对参加大会的矿工要实行“制裁”的威胁，已在该城的工人中引起了极大的愤怒，店员工会特举行了群众大会表示抗议。
