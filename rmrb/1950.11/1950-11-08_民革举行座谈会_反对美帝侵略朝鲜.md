Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang convened a symposium on the morning of the 5th, attended by over 100 people, including central committee members, members of solidarity, and staff from the headquarters and the Beijing branch, to oppose U.S. imperialist aggression against Korea. Chairman Li Jishen presided over the meeting. First, Committee Member Shao Lizi reported on the significance of opposing U.S. imperialist aggression against Korea. He pointed out that U.S. imperialism is following the old path of Japanese imperialism, attempting to dominate the world and bring about its own destruction. He said: The U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Korea has now seriously threatened the security of our motherland's territory. Therefore, from any point of view, we cannot sit idly by and ignore the U.S. imperialists' mad aggression against Korea! Committee Member Liu Yazi, with his hair already gray, then spoke. He vehemently denounced the crimes of U.S. imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea. He said: If U.S. imperialism dares to launch a third world war, Truman, MacArthur, Marshall, and others will not escape the fate of their predecessors, Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo! Then, Committee Member Zhu Xuefan, who recently returned from Europe, expressed his views on the current situation in Europe and the Korean issue. He said: The people of all European countries generally believe that the German issue and the Korean issue are the keys to peace in Asia and Europe. U.S., British, and French imperialists are trying to use Germany as a base for anti-Soviet and anti-communist activities, but the German people are firmly opposed to this. Next, he reported on the enthusiastic situation of the working people in European imperialist countries in striving for peace and democracy and expanding the anti-aggression movement, and made the following conclusion: The unity of the working people of the world on the side of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union is a great contribution to defending world peace. After a heated discussion, the symposium adjourned at noon. In order to carry out more widespread and in-depth discussions, it was decided to conduct group discussions starting from the 6th, and to continue to hold the second expanded symposium at the headquarters on the afternoon of the 8th. Participants on the 5th unanimously expressed their determination to implement the joint declaration of the democratic parties with practical actions.

　　民革举行座谈会
    反对美帝侵略朝鲜
    【新华社六日讯】中国国民党革命委员会于五日上午召集在京中央委员，团结委员及总部，北京市分部的工作人员一百余人举行反对美帝国主义侵略朝鲜座谈会。会议由李济深主席主持。首由邵力子委员报告反对美帝侵略朝鲜的意义。他指出，美帝国主义正在走着日本帝国主义企图霸占世界自取灭亡的老路。他说：美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争目前已严重地威胁到我们祖国的领土安全，所以，从任何角度看，我们都不能坐视美帝国主义对朝鲜的疯狂侵略而置之不理！须发斑白的柳亚子委员继起发言。他激昂愤慨地痛斥了美帝国主义侵略台湾、侵略朝鲜的罪行。他说：美帝国主义如果胆敢发动第三次世界大战，杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟、马歇尔等必将逃不脱他们的前辈希特勒、墨索里尼和东条的命运！接着由最近自欧洲回国的朱学范委员就目前欧洲的局势及朝鲜问题发表意见。他说：欧洲各国人民一般都认为西德问题和朝鲜问题是亚洲和欧洲和平的关键，美、英、法帝国主义正图把德国作为反苏反共的基地，但德国的人民是坚决反对的。接着，他报告了欧洲帝国主义国家内劳动人民为争取和平与民主，扩大反侵略运动的热烈情形，并作了如下的结论说：全世界的劳动人民团结在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营方面，这对于保卫世界和平是一个很大的贡献。座谈会经过热烈的讨论后至中午休会。为了展开更普遍更深入的讨论起见，决定自六日起再分组进行讨论，八日下午继续在总部举行第二次扩大座谈会。五日与会者一致表示决以实际行动贯彻各民主党派联合宣言。
