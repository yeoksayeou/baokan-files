　　Four Thousand Gather at Democracy Square
    Peking University Holds Anti-American Aggression Evening
    Anti-American Aggression Committee Established to Prepare for Propaganda in the Countryside
    Our Army Marches into Tibet, Whole School Cheers Enthusiastically
    [Report from this newspaper] The Peking University Anti-American Aggression Temporary Work Committee held a school-wide anti-American imperialist aggression evening at Democracy Square on the evening of the 1st at 7 p.m. In addition to faculty and students of the whole school, representatives from Huiwen, Yuying, Beiman, Muzhen and other schools, as well as the Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League's Literature and Art Department, a certain anti-aircraft artillery regiment's club, public enterprises and other agencies and organizations, 13 units in total, attended. The number of attendees was about four thousand. The masses' emotions were unprecedentedly enthusiastic. Before the evening began, a third-year student from the Law Department announced that they had discovered a special agent in their class, exposing a series of counter-revolutionary crimes committed by the agent. Therefore, he reminded students to be extra vigilant and announced that the class had decided to recommend to the school committee that the special agent be expelled and handed over to public security departments for investigation. The whole audience applauded enthusiastically in support. The evening began with a large chorus singing "Oppose Aggression War." Next, the Economics Department performed a pantomime. The pantomime featured the American imperialist representative in the East—McMagic. The pantomime told the people: American imperialism launched a war of aggression in Korea, massacred the Korean people, and now has extended its claws to the Yalu River. Students felt extreme anger at the American imperialist acts of aggression. The second program was "Dance of Demons" performed by students of the pre-medical program. Austin, Jeb, Chiang Ting-fu, this group of man-eating demons, finally entered the fascist coffin and kept Hitler company. The dance group and the drama society also participated in performing "Unyielding Seoul."
    In addition, all departments of Peking University have established "Anti-American Aggression Committees" and suggested that the Student Union and the Trade Union establish a school-wide committee and requested a three-day holiday to conduct propaganda on resisting America, aiding Korea, safeguarding the home and defending the country in the countryside and on the streets.
    [Another dispatch] When the news of our army's march into Tibet reached Peking University, the whole school was overjoyed and unanimously believed that this not only liberated the Tibetan compatriots from suffering, but also consolidated the national defense and was a head-on blow to imperialist aggressors!

　　四千人齐集民主广场
    北大举办反美侵略晚会
    成立反美侵略委员会准备下乡宣传
    我军进军西藏，全校同学热烈欢呼
    【本报讯】北京大学反美侵略临时工作委员会于一日晚七时在民主广场举办了一个全校性的反对美帝侵略晚会，除全校师生参加外，并到有汇文、育英、贝满、慕贞等校及团市委文艺部、高射炮某团俱乐部、公营企业等各机关团体十三个单位。到会人数约四千。群众情绪空前热烈。晚会开始前，法律系三年级同学宣布他们班上发现一名特务分子，揭发了该特务一连串的反革命罪行，因此提醒同学要加倍提高警惕，并宣布该班已决定建议校委会开除该特务学籍，送公安部门查办。全场热烈鼓掌支持。晚会在大合唱“反对侵略战争”歌声中开始。接着经济系演出了哑剧。哑剧中出现了美帝在东方的代表——麦魔。哑剧告诉人们：美帝在朝鲜发动了侵略战争，屠杀了朝鲜人民，现在并已将魔掌伸向了鸭绿江畔。同学们对美帝的侵略行为，感到了极大的愤恨。第二个节目是沙滩医预科同学演出的“群魔乱舞”。奥斯汀、杰伯、蒋廷黻这群吃人魔鬼，最后终于走进了法西斯的棺材，和希特勒做了同伴。舞蹈组的舞蹈与剧艺社也参加演出了“不屈服的汉城”。
    又，北大各系都成立了“反美侵略委员会”，建议学生会与工会成立全校性委员会，并要求放假三天，到农村和街头进行抗美援朝保家卫国的宣传。
    【又讯】我军进军西藏的消息传到北大，全校同学欢欣若狂，一致认为：这不但把西藏同胞从苦难中解放出来，而且巩固了祖国国防，对帝国主义者的侵略来说，也是一个当头棒喝！
