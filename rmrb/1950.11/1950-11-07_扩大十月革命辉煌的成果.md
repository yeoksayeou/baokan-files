　　Expanding the Brilliant Achievements of the October Revolution
    Li Jishen
    The October Revolution that took place in the Soviet Union thirty-three years ago was a turning point in human history. The October Revolution overthrew the rule of landlords and capitalists, completely eliminated the old system of man exploiting man, and created the first proletarian dictatorship in history.

    In these thirty-three years, the Soviet Union has been engaged in socialist peaceful construction, eliminating ignorance, backwardness, poverty, and weakness, bringing culture, progress, prosperity, and health to the working people of the whole country, and also bringing hope and light to all mankind.

    The achievements of the October Revolution are based on the laws of the development of human society. The great Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin led us to understand this law and practice this law. No one and no force can stop the progress and development of human society. Therefore, the achievements of the October Revolution have unlimited prospects. Every enlightened person must strive to expand the achievements of this revolution!

    Following the Soviet Union, the establishment of seven new democratic countries in Europe was generated under the shining light of the October Revolution; the great victory of the Chinese revolution, which led a quarter of mankind onto a new social path and changed the entire world situation, was also completed under the direct influence of the October Revolution.

    The revolutionary achievements of the Chinese people have enhanced the confidence of the Asian people in liberation. The people of Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Japan have formed an incomparably powerful force in the fiery struggle. The rulers of the old world, headed by US imperialism, are currently carrying out bloody suppression in an attempt to rule Asia and enslave the world. Their attempt is nothing more than to stagnate human society and overturn the laws of social development. This arrogant attempt will inevitably end in a tragic failure.

    The brilliant achievements of the October Revolution will continue to expand, infinitely expand.

    The people of China have already seen clearly the actions of the US imperialist aggressors in Korea and their relationship to China's future safety. The people of the whole country are demanding to fight for the sacred task of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country through voluntary action. This just demand and struggle will win the sympathy and support of all mankind in the world, and will inevitably isolate the imperialists and lead to their failure.

    Looking back at the first few years after the October Revolution, the Soviet Union was besieged by the armies of British, French, Japanese, and American imperialism. At that time, the Soviet Union was isolated and helpless, and its military strength was weak. However, under the leadership of Lenin, the Soviet workers and peasants resolutely fought and finally defeated the besieging imperialist armies. Now, the situation of our new China is much better than the conditions of the Soviet Union in those years. The peace camp headed by the Soviet Union has 800 million heroic people united together, and it is undoubtedly able to repel any imperialist attack. We should emulate the spirit of the October Revolution, expand the achievements of the October Revolution, unite under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and strive for lasting world peace by resisting US aggression and aiding Korea to protect our homes and defend our country.

　　扩大十月革命辉煌的成果
    李济深
    三十三年前苏联所发生的十月革命，是人类历史的一个转捩点。十月革命推翻了地主资本家的统治，彻底消灭人剥削人的旧制度，创立了历史上第一个无产阶级专政的新国家。
    苏联在这三十三年当中，进行着社会主义的和平建设工作，扫除了愚昧，落后，贫困和衰弱，给全国劳动人民带来了文化，进步，繁荣和健康，也给全世界的人类带来了希望和光明。
    十月革命的成就，是根据人类社会发展的规律得来的。伟大的马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林，领导着我们认识了这个规律，实践了这个规律。任何人任何力量都不能阻止人类社会的进步和发展，因此，十月革命的成就，前途是不可限量的。我们每一个觉悟了的人，都必须为扩大这个革命的成果而尽力奋斗！
    继苏联之后，欧洲七个新民主主义国家的建立，是在十月革命光辉的照耀之下而产生的；中国革命的伟大的胜利，把四分之一的人类引上了新的社会途径，使整个世界局势为之改观，也是在十月革命直接影响之下完成的。
    中国人民的革命成就，提高了亚洲人民解放的信心，朝鲜人民，越南人民，菲律宾人民，日本人民，都在如火如荼的斗争中形成了无比强大的力量，以美帝国主义为首的旧世界的统治者，目前正在进行血腥的镇压，企图统治亚洲，奴役世界。他们的这种企图无非想使人类社会停滞不进，把社会发展的规律推翻，这种狂妄的企图结果必然会遭到悲惨的失败。
    十月革命辉煌的成果势将继续扩大，无限地扩大。
    全中国的人民已经看清了美帝国侵略者在朝鲜的行动以及对于中国未来的安危关系。全国人民正在要求用志愿的行动为着抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务而奋斗。这种合乎正义的要求和奋斗，将博得全世界人类的同情支援，使帝国主义者必然陷于孤立，归于失败。
    回顾十月革命后的最初数年间，苏联受英法日美各帝国主义军队的围攻，当时苏联孤立无援，兵力薄弱，然而苏联的工农大众在列宁领导之下，坚决奋斗，终于把围攻的帝国主义军队击溃。现在我们新中国的处境，比当年苏联的条件更为优越，以苏联为首的和平阵营，有八万万英勇的人民团结在一起，足能击退任何帝国主义的进攻而无疑。我们应当效法十月革命的精神，扩大十月革命的成果，团结在毛主席的领导之下，为抗美援朝保家卫国争取世界的持久和平而奋斗。
