　　Movie Promotion Month: Good Movie Introduction
    "Flames of Wrath"
    The re-release of "Flames of Wrath" today, amidst the mad aggression of American imperialism in Korea and its violation of our country's airspace and territorial waters, carries even deeper significance. This film was made to commemorate the faithful son of the Belarusian people, the outstanding leader of the Orsha Partisan Unit: Soviet hero Zaslonov. He can be called a model for partisans. From him, we can see the role that the partisans played in the entire battle in containing and striking the enemy, and what tasks they fulfilled in the noble and great mission of defending the motherland, and how great the potential strength of the people to strike the enemy is.

    Through this film, we can see that fascist Germany dreamed of realizing its plan to dominate the world, but it did not expect that after its victory in bullying small and weak countries, it would encounter the powerful opponent, the Soviet Union. It did not expect that the will of the Soviet people was so strong, its strength so great, and the methods of struggle so diverse and difficult to defend against, and the love for the motherland was so united and unbreakable. If you infringe upon him and arouse his anger, he will take up arms, and this power will be even more terrifying.

    Like the protagonist Zaslonov in this film, under the leadership of the Party, he organized an anti-enemy guerrilla force and, disguised as an engineer solely concerned with his livelihood, bravely and adventurously went deep behind enemy lines, personally directing railway workers and all the angered people, intelligently, decisively, and calmly constantly disrupting the enemy's transportation lines and transportation plans. In the long and brutal guerrilla battles with the enemy, he gloriously completed his mission; in coordinating the entire counter-offensive plan, he completed the task of containing the enemy.

    The mad aggression and atrocities of American imperialism are no different from those of German fascism. Today, as we resist America and aid Korea, we must learn from the incomparably strong fighting spirit of Zaslonov's partisan unit and retaliate against the enemy with even more violent blows. We should see that American imperialism, like the German fascist bandits in the film, will suffer the blows of the Soviet people, never to rise again. We must let American imperialism know that the people of China and Korea love peace, but if you infringe upon them and arouse their anger, this flame of anger will burn day and night until the American empire cannot stand, cannot breathe, and until it is completely burned out.

    《愤怒的火焰》
    《愤怒的火焰》在今天美帝疯狂侵略朝鲜与侵犯我国领空领海的时候重新映演，有着更深厚的意义。这部影片是为纪念白俄罗斯人民忠实的儿子奥尔沙游击队的优秀领导者：苏联英雄扎斯洛诺夫而拍制的，他可称为游击队员的表率，我们从它上面，可以看到游击队在整个战斗中所起的牵制敌人和打击敌人的作用，以及在保卫祖国的崇高伟大任务中尽了些什么任务，人民潜在的打击敌人的力量是多么的巨大。
    通过这部影片，我们可以看到，法西斯德国梦想实现它统治世界的计划，却没料到在欺压弱小国家胜利之后，却遇到了强大的对手苏联。它没料到苏联人民的意志是这样的坚强，力量是如此壮大，而斗争的方式又是这么多方面的防不胜防，爱祖国的热情更是团结一致的牢不可破。你要侵犯了他，引起了他的愤怒，他就要拿起武器来，这个力量可就更可怕。
    像本片主角扎斯洛诺夫在党的领导之下，组织了敌后游击队，并且化装了一个专为生活打算的工程师，勇敢的冒险的深入敌后，亲自指挥着铁路工人和一切愤怒了的人民，机智、果敢、沉着的不断的破坏了敌人的交通线和运输计划。在与敌人长期的残酷的游击战斗中，光荣的完成了任务；在配合整个反攻计划上，完成了牵制敌人的任务。
    美帝国主义疯狂的侵略暴行与德国法西斯并无两样。在抗美援朝的今日，我们要学习扎斯洛诺夫的游击队的坚强无比的斗争精神，以较敌人更猛烈的打击去还击敌人；我们应将会看到美帝国主义就像影片中的德国法西斯强盗所遭受到苏联人民的打击一样，再也爬不起来，我们要让美帝国主义知道，中朝两国的人民是爱好和平的，但要侵犯了他，激起了他的愤怒，这个愤怒的火焰，将昼夜的烧得美帝站不住脚，透不过气，一直到把它烧灭掉为止。
