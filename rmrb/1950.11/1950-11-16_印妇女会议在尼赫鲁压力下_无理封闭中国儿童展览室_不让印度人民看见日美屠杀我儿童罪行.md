　　Xinhua News Agency, 15th: New Delhi Dispatch: The Chinese Children's Exhibition Room at the Bombay Children's Exhibition, hosted by the Indian Women's Conference, was unjustifiably closed by the Indian side on November 7th, the second day of the exhibition's opening. The All-China Democratic Women's Federation, at the invitation of the Indian Women's Conference through the Indian Embassy in our country, sent a specialist to host the exhibition with exhibits. The only "reason" for the closure of this exhibition room was that the exhibits included photos of innocent Chinese children massacred by Japanese invading aircraft in the past and by American invading aircraft in Korea recently. After the exhibition was arranged, just before the opening, the person in charge of the Indian Women's Conference suddenly demanded that the photos of Japanese and American aircraft bombing Chinese children be removed from the Chinese exhibition room, and said that otherwise the Indian Prime Minister would not visit the exhibition room. The person in charge of the exhibition informed them that the exhibition of these photos would help to understand the real life of Chinese children and would also help to maintain peace and oppose aggression, and could not be removed. When the exhibition opened, Indian Prime Minister Nehru attended the meeting, but did not enter the Chinese exhibition room. The next afternoon, the person in charge of the Indian Women's Conference sent someone to forcibly close the Chinese exhibition room. The extremely rude actions of the person in charge of the Indian Women's Conference towards the Chinese exhibition room aroused the indignation of the local progressive women, who believed that: The bizarre behavior of the person in charge of the Indian Women's Conference, even if it was due to obvious pressure, could not escape their own major moral responsibility.

　　印妇女会议在尼赫鲁压力下
    无理封闭中国儿童展览室
    不让印度人民看见日美屠杀我儿童罪行
    【新华社十五日讯】新德里讯：印度妇女会议所主持的孟买儿童展览会的中国儿童展览室，于十一月七日即展览会开幕之次日突遭印度方面无理封闭。这个展览室是中华全国民主妇女联合会受印度妇女会议经过印度驻我国大使馆代为邀请，派了专人携带展览品前往主持的。这个展览室被封闭的唯一“理由”就是因展览品中包括过去日寇侵华飞机及最近美国侵朝飞机屠杀中国无辜儿童的照片。在展览会布置好以后，仅仅在开幕前，印妇女会议负责人突然提出要把中国展览室中日本和美国飞机轰炸中国儿童的照片撤销，并说，否则印度总理即不到该展览室参观。该展览室负责人员当告以此项照片的展览有助于了解中国儿童的真实生活，也有助于维护和平反对侵略，不能撤销。展览会开幕时，印度总理尼赫鲁到会参观，果然不进入中国展览室。次日下午，印妇女会议负责人员竟派人强将中国展览室封闭。印度妇女会议负责人员对待中国展览室的极端无礼的行动，引起当地进步妇女界的愤慨，她们认为：印度妇女会议负责人员的这种离奇的行径，纵然是出于明显的压力，但是决不能逃脱自己的道义上的重大责任。
