Xinhua News Agency, Eighth Dispatch: TASS Moscow, Sixth Dispatch: Pravda special correspondent Bo Qianke's Korean dispatch writes: The Korean People's Army is conducting fierce battles in the mountains of North Korea and has intensified its counterattacks against the American invaders in the past few days. In some areas, the People's Army troops have pushed the enemy back 30 to 40 kilometers. Walker, commander of the US Eighth Army, personally went to the front line to "restore the situation." He requested reinforcements with new reserve troops, even though there are already eight divisions of US ground forces and 1,000 aircraft from the Fifth Air Force participating in the war against Korea.

In this way, Walker is tantamount to admitting that the 190,000 soldiers under the US command in Korea are not enough to break the resistance of the People's Army. The war has taken on a protracted nature, requiring the United States to invest more and more troops. The morale and military training of the Korean People's Army infantry have proven to be higher and stronger than that of the American infantry. The Korean War has shown that, no matter what the unlucky American strategists say, the main combat force is still the infantry, which can cooperate well with other arms of service. The People's Army successfully uses anti-tank guns to deal with American tanks, transporting anti-tank guns to the battlefield by truck. People's Army soldiers often destroy tanks with hand grenades, climb onto enemy tanks, cover their observation ports, preventing the tank drivers from seeing outside, and forcing them to surrender.

When Korean People's Army soldiers fight against American aerial bandits, they widely use light and heavy machine guns in addition to anti-aircraft guns. Among the American aircraft shot down, many were shot down by the accurate firepower of the People's Army's machine gunners and riflemen. The People's Army has demonstrated many heroic deeds. Every battle produces hundreds of heroes. The examples of bravery and self-sacrifice shown by the Party members and soldiers of the Workers' Party inspire the regiments, battalions, and companies of the people to conduct a relentless struggle against the American invaders—the Korean people's most heinous enemy.

### 朝鲜人民军加强反击  在美国指挥下的十九万人还不足以击破人民军抵抗

　　朝鲜人民军加强反击
    在美国指挥下的十九万人还不足以击破人民军抵抗
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科六日讯：真理报特派记者波诚科朝鲜通讯写道：朝鲜人民军在北朝鲜的山岭中进行激烈的战斗，过去几天中加紧了对美国干涉者的反击。在若干地区，人民军部队将敌人击退了三十至四十公里。美国第八军军长瓦克曾亲往最前线去“恢复情势”，他要求以新的后备部队增援，虽然加入对朝鲜作战的，已经有美国地面部队八个师和第五航空队的一千架飞机。
    这样，瓦克就等于承认了在朝鲜美国指挥部下面的十九万士兵，还不足以击破人民军的抵抗。战争已经有了长期的性质，需要美国投入越来越多的部队了。朝鲜人民军步兵的士气和军事训练，已证明比美国步兵更高更强。朝鲜战争表明了不论倒霉的美国战略家怎么说，主要的作战力量仍然是能与其他兵种良好配合的步兵。人民军以反坦克炮胜利地对付美国坦克，用卡车将反坦克炮赶运到作战地点。人民军战士常用手榴弹炸毁坦克，爬上敌人的坦克，遮住它的瞭望眼，使坦克手看不见外面，迫使他投降。
    朝鲜人民战士与美国空中强盗作战时，除了高射炮以外，还广为使用轻重机枪。在被击落的美机中，有许多是被人民军的机枪和步枪手准确的火力击落的。人民军表现了许多的英雄主义事迹。每一场战斗都产生出成百的英雄。劳动党党员战士所表现的勇敢自我牺牲的榜样，鼓舞着人民的团、营、连去与美国干涉者——朝鲜人民万恶的敌人进行无情的斗争。
