Xinhua News Agency, 27th: People in Rehe, Shanxi, and other places protested MacArthur's illegal release of Japanese war criminal Shigemitsu Mamoru.

The people of Rehe Province, who suffered thirteen years of devastation under the Japanese invaders, expressed immense anger at MacArthur's unauthorized release of Japanese war criminal Shigemitsu Mamoru. The Rehe Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Democratic Women's Federation, and six other people's organizations, representing five million people across the province, issued a letter of protest, resolutely supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. The protest letter recounted the towering crimes committed by Japanese imperialism in Rehe Province after the "September 18th" Incident when they occupied Northeast China. In that province, 200,000 people were killed or taken away by the Japanese invaders. To this day, the slopes of Shuiquangou (a killing ground used by the Japanese at the time) in the suburbs of Chengde City are still covered with countless unmarked graves; the remains of "Ten Thousand People Pits," where the Japanese invaders massacred countless national heroes and patriotic men of virtue in Rehe Province, still exist; the "village consolidation" policy implemented by the Japanese invaders in the province and the area north of the Great Wall in western Liaoxi Province resulted in a desolate "no-man's land" of 175,000 square li, burned down more than 3.82 million houses, and left 1.05 million people homeless; the Japanese invaders also seized 248,700 head of draught animals in the province, with the result that many farmers still have to use human labor to pull ploughs to cultivate the land; the Japanese invaders' policy of poisoning caused 600,000 laborers in the province to become sallow-faced and emaciated opium addicts, all of which became an important reason for the province's years of severe disasters. The protest letter stated: the people of Rehe Province have an irreconcilable blood feud with the Japanese war criminals, and the Chinese people will never allow MacArthur to try to erase this blood debt.

Nine people's organizations, including the Shanxi Province and Taiyuan City People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, jointly issued a circular on the 25th, stating: "We can never forget the bloody atrocities committed by war criminal Shigemitsu Mamoru against the Chinese people during the war of aggression against China. Therefore, we fully support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and demand that MacArthur be declared the main criminal for instigating wars of aggression and harboring war criminals."

Cheng Qian, Chairman of the Hunan Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for Defending World Peace and Opposing American Aggression, stated: the war criminals such as Shigemitsu Mamoru are covered in the blood of the Chinese people, and MacArthur dared to brazenly release them without authorization. The people of Hunan resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and the Soviet government's protest and will more broadly launch the campaign to resist America and aid Korea to protest this crime of American imperialism.

In his written statement, Deng Baoshan, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial People's Government, pointed out that the Chinese people, who had paid a huge price to defeat the Japanese aggression forces, could never tolerate the revival of the Japanese aggression forces. MacArthur's illegal release of Class A war criminal Shigemitsu Mamoru is precisely evidence that American imperialism is attempting to copy the old path of the Japanese warlords, using Korea as a stepping stone to invade China. We should actively support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army in their joint sacred war against America.

The people of Zhangjiakou City were filled with anger after hearing the news of MacArthur's illegal release of Class A war criminal Shigemitsu Mamoru and other war criminals, and they unanimously supported the Soviet note and the statement of our Foreign Minister Zhou. The husband of Wang Zhenning, a military dependent in Zhangjiakou City, was tortured to death by the Japanese invaders in prison, and his house and property were seized by the Japanese invaders for no reason. She gritted her teeth and said: "Just the mention of the Japanese devils drives me crazy. Now America has released Japanese war criminals again, wanting the devils to bully us again. How can this be allowed? We must fight it out. I want to avenge my husband and avenge all the Chinese people."

　　热河山西甘肃等地人民
    抗议麦魔释放战犯重光葵
    日本战犯满身浸透了中国人民的鲜血
    我们绝不允许麦魔一手涂抹这笔血债
    【新华社二十七日讯】热河、山西等地人民抗议麦克阿瑟非法释放日本重要战犯重光葵。
    饱受日寇十三年蹂躏的热河省人民，对于麦克阿瑟擅自释放日本战犯重光葵的非法行为，表示无比的愤怒。热河省总工会、民主妇女联合会等八个人民团体特代表全省五百万人民发出抗议书，坚决拥护我外交部周外长的声明。抗议书中历述日本帝国主义自“九一八”侵占东北后，在热河省所制造的滔天罪行。该省曾有二十万人民被日寇杀死或抓走，至今承德市郊水泉沟（日寇在当时用以杀人的刑场）的山坡上仍然荒冢累累；日寇在热河省曾屠杀了无数民族英雄和爱国志士的“万人坑”的遗迹犹然存在；日寇在该省及辽西省西部长城以北地区实行“集家并村”的结果，曾造成十七万五千方里荒凉的“无人区”，烧毁了三百八十二万余间房屋，使一百零五万人无家可归；日寇又曾在该省抢走了二十四万八千七百头耕畜，因而至今仍有许多农民必须用人拉犁种地；日寇的毒化政策，使该省六十万劳动力变成面黄饥瘦的烟民，所有这些均成为该省连年遭受严重灾荒的重要原因之一。抗议书称：热河省人民与日本战犯有着不共戴天的血海深仇，麦克阿瑟企图一手涂抹这笔血账，中国人民是绝不允许的。
    山西省暨太原市各界人民代表会议协商委员会等九个人民团体，于二十五日联合发表通电，内称：我们永远不能忘记“战犯重光葵在侵华战争中血腥杀害中国人民的暴行，因此，我们完全支持周外长的声明，并要求宣布麦克阿瑟是挑动侵略战争、包庇战犯的主要罪犯”。
    中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会湖南分会主席程潜称：重光葵等战犯们满身浸透了中国人民的鲜血，而麦克阿瑟竟敢悍然擅自释放，湖南人民坚决拥护周外长的声明及苏联政府的抗议，并将更广泛地展开抗美援朝运动以抗议美帝国主义此一罪行。
    甘肃省人民政府邓宝珊主席发表的书面谈话中指出：曾经付出了巨大代价，打垮了日本侵略势力的中国人民，是决不能容忍日本侵略势力的复活的。麦克阿瑟非法释放甲级战犯重光葵，正是美帝国主义企图抄袭日本军阀的老路，由朝鲜进而侵略中国的证据之一，我们应积极支援中国人民志愿部队和朝鲜人民军所并肩进行的神圣的抗美战争。
    张家口市人民听到了麦克阿瑟非法释放甲级战犯重光葵及其他战犯消息后，愤怒填胸，一致拥护苏联照会和我国周外长的声明。张市军属王祯宁的丈夫曾被日寇在监狱里折磨死，房屋财产被日寇无故霸占。她咬牙切齿地说：“一提起日本鬼子就把我气疯了，现在美国又放了日本战犯，想让鬼子再来欺负我们，这怎么能行？一定要和它拚，我要为我丈夫报仇，为全中国人民报仇。”
