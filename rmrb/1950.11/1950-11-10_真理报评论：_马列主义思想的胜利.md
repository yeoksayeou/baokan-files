　　*Pravda* Commentary:
    The Victory of Marxist-Leninist Thought
    [Xinhua News Agency Dispatch from Moscow, 6th] *Pravda* published an editorial today stating: Never in world history has there been a period more filled with momentous events than the past few decades. In these years, the working people have achieved remarkable victories in their struggle for liberation and the construction of a new life. The victory of the great October Revolution and the creation of the world's first socialist state were made possible thanks to the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and its great, brilliant leaders – Lenin and Stalin.

    The Soviet Union's victorious communist construction, the remarkable achievements of the people's democratic countries in building socialism, the consolidation of the People's Republic of China, and the establishment and strengthening of the German Democratic Republic – all of these are victories of the great ideas of the October Revolution and the victories of the ever-victorious ideas of Marxism-Leninism. The camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, headed by the Soviet Union, is now a tremendous force, exerting a decisive influence on the entire course of world history.

    *Pravda* continued, stating that the socialist motherland – the motherland of Leninism, is gloriously fulfilling its international obligations to the working people of all countries through its remarkable victories in communist construction, and is giving them valuable assistance in the common struggle for the peace, freedom, and happiness of all peoples – the Soviet people are deeply proud of this. It is a great fortune for the people of our country and the working people of all countries that the struggle for socialism is led by revolutionary geniuses, the glorious leaders of revolutionary theory, the founders and leaders of the world's most revolutionary party, the Bolshevik Party – Lenin and Stalin.

    Lenin and Stalin's party has won the love of the masses because of its selfless loyalty to the cause of communism and its heroic struggle for the liberation of the working people. The masses regard it as the party that embodies the vital interests of the people, as a wise leader and teacher, and as a long-tested organizer of the victory in the struggle for socialism for more than fifty years. Lenin and Stalin's party organized and united the people of all nationalities in our country, leading them through the storms of three revolutions to create the world's first socialist state of workers and peasants. The great achievement of the Bolshevik Party lies in the fact that after guaranteeing the victory of the dictatorship of the proletariat, it inspired the broad masses of the people to carry out unprecedented creative endeavors, armed them with the prospect of communist construction, and educated the Soviet people in the spirit of Leninism.

    The reason why our country has been able to transform itself into a powerful socialist state in an astonishingly short period, and why our people have deservedly won the glory of a heroic people, a creative people, and a constructing people, is due to the great Bolshevik Party, and to the brilliant leadership of Lenin and Stalin. The victory of Stalin's Five-Year Plans proves that if the party knows where it is going and is not afraid of difficulties, it is invincible. The reason why our people were able to win a victory of world-historical significance in the Patriotic War, why they were able to victoriously and gloriously defend the freedom and independence of their country and save humanity from the threat of fascist enslavement, is all due to the great Bolshevik Party, and to the brilliant leadership of Comrade Stalin. The Soviet people are today victoriously realizing the great task of communist construction, and our country is marching at the forefront of the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism, for which we must thank the great Bolshevik Party and Comrade Stalin's wise leadership.

    *Pravda* concluded by saying that the ideas of the great October Revolution, the brilliance of the all-conquering ideas of Lenin and Stalin, illuminate the path of the working people of all countries towards the victory of communism.

　　真理报评论：
    马列主义思想的胜利
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科六日电：今日真理报发表社论称：世界历史上从来没有一个时期比过去数十年中更充满着巨大的事件。在这些年月里，劳动人民在争取解放和建设新生活的斗争中取得了显赫的胜利。伟大的十月革命的胜利、世界上第一个社会主义国家的创立，其所以成为可能，要感谢布尔什维克党及其伟大的天才领袖——列宁和斯大林——的领导。
    苏联胜利的共产主义建设、人民民主国家在建设社会主义中的显赫成就、中华人民共和国的巩固、德意志民主共和国的成立与加强——这一切都是伟大的十月革命思想的胜利、百战百胜的马克思——列宁主义思想的胜利。以苏联为首的和平、民主与社会主义阵营现在是一个巨大的力量，对世界历史的整个发展过程起着决定性的影响。
    真理报继称，社会主义祖国——列宁主义的祖国，正在以它的共产主义建设中的显赫胜利，光荣地完成着对一切国家劳动人民的国际义务，正在给予他们宝贵的援助共同为争取各国人民的和平、自由和幸福而斗争——苏维埃人民深深以此自豪。我国人民及一切国家的劳动人民很大幸运，就是争取社会主义的斗争由革命天才、革命理论的光荣领袖、世界上最革命的政党布尔什维克党的建立者及领袖——列宁与斯大林领导着。
    列宁和斯大林的党由于它忘我地忠诚于共产主义事业，由于它为了劳动人民的解放而英勇斗争，已经获得了群众的热爱。群众认为它是体现人民切身利益的党，是明智的领导者和导师，是五十余年来争取社会主义斗争的胜利的久经考验的组织者。列宁和斯大林的党组织并团结了我国各族人民，领导他们经过三次革命的暴风雨而创立了世界上第一个工农社会主义国家。布尔什维克党的伟大功绩在于它在保证了无产阶级专政胜利之后，鼓舞着广大人民群众进行空前高度的创造，以共产主义建设的前景武装他们，以列宁主义思想的精神教育苏联人民。
    我们国家所以能在惊人的短短时期内变成强大的社会主义国家，我国人民所以能当之无愧地赢得英雄的人民、创造的人民及建设的人民的光荣，应归功于伟大的布尔什维克党，归功于列宁和斯大林的天才领导。斯大林五年计划的胜利证明：如果党知道它正在走向何处而且不怕困难的话，它是不可战胜的。我国人民所以能在爱国战争中赢得具有世界历史意义的胜利，他们所以能胜利地、光荣地保卫他们国家的自由与独立和拯救人类免于法西斯奴役的威胁，都应归功于伟大的布尔什维克党，归功于斯大林同志的天才领导。苏联人民今日正在胜利地实现共产主义建设的巨大任务，我们的国家正在争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争的前列迈进，对于这些我们都得感谢伟大的布尔什维克党，感谢斯大林同志英明的领导。
    真理报在结语中称，伟大的十月革命的思想，战胜一切的列宁和斯大林的思想的光辉，照彻了全世界各国劳动人民走向共产主义胜利的道路。
