Soviet Millet (Foxtail Millet) Increase Production Hero
    Bairseyev (Part 2)
    Yang Kaidao
    When Bairseyev went to Moscow to receive the Order of Lenin, he went to the Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences to see Lysenko. The first thing he asked was: "What is the maximum limit for millet yield? Where is the end point of our road to increasing millet production?" Lysenko replied: "Our great Soviet agricultural scientist Williams once said that the maximum possible yield of grain per hectare is 200 quintals. His estimate is based on solar thermal energy and crop absorption capacity. Although many people think Williams' estimate is too high and a bit extravagant, I (Lysenko himself) think Williams' theory is correct. However, theory is theory, and facts are facts. Until now, no one has reached Williams' ideal limit. And your increased production results are the highest in agricultural history." The two continued to talk. He told Dean Lysenko about his method and process for improving millet varieties. He also mentioned the cultivation management situation, how he conflicted with the agricultural instructor's views, and how he rolled the ground once after sowing, which the instructor thought was wrong. Lysenko told him that old agricultural textbooks opposed rolling the land after sowing, but in windy areas, it is easier to dry out if it is not rolled, while rolling can help preserve moisture in the soil. He also told Dean Lysenko that the agricultural instructor told everyone that in addition to chemical fertilizers, all cow manure, sheep manure, and chicken manure should be fully utilized. However, their nomadic people did not use livestock manure for fertilizing in the past. Lysenko told him that the land cultivated by nomadic people in the past was fertile virgin land, so there was no need to use livestock manure. At the same time, livestock roamed everywhere, and farmers could not accumulate fertilizer. In the future, both should be used together.
    In 1941, the Soviet-German war was raging fiercely, and millet production increase work in various places was affected and stalled by the war. However, Bairseyev's millet production increase team continued to operate. The average yield increased somewhat. The four-hectare high-yield area achieved a new record of 155.8 quintals (2,077 jin per mu). In the autumn of that year, the war intensified. Moscow and Leningrad were under serious threat. In order to慰勞 the frontline soldiers, a nationwide movement to support the army was launched. Bairseyev's farm naturally made considerable donations. And he himself separately presented 350 poods (10,900 jin). Their慰勞 items were intended to be given to the soldiers in Leningrad. However, Leningrad was surrounded by German bandits at the time, so the several trainloads of millet they donated were first transported to Moscow and accepted by a representative of the Leningrad District Party Committee. A part was transported to the Svir front. They organized a grain donation delegation. Bairseyev was also one of the grain donation representatives. They not only accompanied the grain to Moscow, but also went to the Svir front to observe the battle. There, the producing soldiers and the armed soldiers met,慰勞ing and encouraging each other. The soldiers promised to drive away the German bandits, and the farmers promised to work harder to ensure the supply of military grain. When they talked about Bairseyev's achievements in increasing millet production, everyone looked at him with curious and suspicious eyes. He told these soldiers that although almost all the young men had left to join the army, and his own son was also at the front, production in the rear had not slackened. On the contrary, everyone was working even more intensely. Women replaced the positions of young men, and one person did the work of two. The elderly also did not rest and became younger and more useful. He himself was over sixty years old and had not rested for a minute during his work. In Moscow, they heard many heroic sacrifices of soldiers and were very moved. They decided to redouble their efforts and continue to increase production to serve the motherland and serve the people.
    In 1942, their ordinary increase production area of 38 hectares (570 mu) had a yield of 105 quintals per hectare (1,400 jin per mu), while the high-yield area had a yield of 175 quintals (2,333 jin per mu). He personally donated another 50,000 rubles to support the army, and Marshal Stalin sent a reply expressing his thanks. He published a statement in the newspaper, determined to further increase production to repay Stalin's attention to him. Many friends advised him that his achievements were already very high, and it would not be easy to go higher. He replied to them: "Is it more difficult than holding Leningrad?" Many friends and socialist competition opponents came to see him, exchange opinions with him, and ask him for some seeds. He was not stingy at all and told them everything frankly. In the winter of 1942, all members of the group participated in seed selection work. Their seeds were already very good and large. The selected seeds were even better and larger. The average weight of one thousand seeds was less than five grams (about 1.5 fen), while the seeds they selected weighed seven or eight grams (2.3 to 2.4 fen). He also found a 40-hectare (600 mu) fertile virgin land, with black calcium soil in the lower layer and a lot of sheep manure in the upper layer (it may have been a grazing land before), as their increase production land. He also designated the best four hectares (60 mu) as a high-yield area. In the spring of 1943, they began to dig ditches, a total of 600,000 cubic meters of earthwork. Individual farmers dug 18 cubic meters of earthwork per day. Although it was so hard, everyone was still very happy to do it. In the high-yield area, they put in more effort and applied more manure.
    The farm chairman asked him with a smile, what does the millet tell you? When does it need to drink water? Bairseyev replied: "I found the answer, Lysenko inspired me. In hot weather, people drink water urgently. In cool weather, people drink water slowly. It is not good to drink water too quickly. Drinking it slowly is flavorful and useful. I think the same is true for crops. Last year I discovered that the harvest of fields irrigated in the evening or early morning was better than that of fields irrigated during the hot day." They decided not to irrigate in sunny days, but to wait until the sun went down before starting irrigation, and to stop again the next morning. This autumn, the German army was retreating steadily, and the Soviet army began to counterattack. Their millet fields also had a victorious harvest. Although the ordinary increase production area only had a yield of 80 quintals per hectare (1,066 jin per mu), the high-yield area had a yield of 201 quintals (2,680 jin per mu), breaking the expected maximum possible yield of Soviet agricultural science master Williams. Many ears had as many as 1,500 grains, and a few had as many as 3,000 grains. That is to say, one grain of millet can increase 1,500 times or even 3,000 times in one year. Their group of ten people produced a total of more than 2,800 quintals of millet (560,000 jin), with each person having more than 280 quintals (56,000 jin). In addition, they jointly planted four hectares of vegetables, melons, fruits, and potatoes. In addition to the daily work remuneration that each person should receive, they also received more than 470 quintals (94,000 jin) of grain as a reward. They dedicated all of this reward to the Soviet Red Army. They all fulfilled the work they had guaranteed to do last year. The armed soldiers drove away all the German bandits; the producing soldiers increased production again.
    When the artillery salutes celebrated the liberation of Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, Bairseyev also received a congratulatory letter from Dean Lysenko, praising his production achievements as the highest millet production record in the world. He smiled: "Our millet achievements also have scientific value." In the spring of 1944, he came to Moscow again and went to the Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences to see Lysenko. Lysenko said: "I am convinced that millet is a high-yield crop, which you have proved with facts. This is something that old professors thought was impossible. When they wrote textbooks, they unanimously believed that millet was a low-yield crop. Now they must rewrite their textbooks." Bairseyev replied: "That's right." Not only did he obtain high millet yields, but thousands of other farmers also obtained high yields. A neighboring female leader of a millet production increase group created a record of 175 quintals. He had a relative who created a record of 203 quintals. In addition, there was another millet production increase group leader who created a record of 206 quintals. However, their production area was not large. Bairseyev opened the way, and many people are following him forward. He is extremely happy. If he could live longer, he would definitely try to increase production again. Lysenko asked him how to increase production again? He advocated that the row spacing and plant spacing should be the same, and the seeding rate should be slightly reduced so that the yield per plant would increase from six grams (1.8 fen) to eight grams (2.4 fen). Of course, more fertilizer should be applied. They can apply more sheep manure and chicken manure. He also said that sowing after the storm in the Caspian Sea is better than before. He consulted Lysenko's opinion, and Lysenko replied: "I can only learn from you, and I have nothing to contribute to you." So Lysenko gave him a copy of the Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences Wartime Work Report, and personally inscribed the following words:
    The greatest scientists estimate that the yield of grain per hectare cannot exceed 200 quintals. This estimate is based on the solar thermal energy that crops can absorb. Your production results exceed this estimate, proving that crop yield is determined by people.
    Honor to the unprecedented highest producer.
    I wish you good health and a long life!
    Lysenko
    April 6, 1944
    He said goodbye to Lysenko. Lysenko sent him out and personally put on his coat for him. He gave Lysenko his final instructions: "Don't forget the winter wheat you promised to send me. I will strive for good wheat production records in our dry and cold region." Lysenko promised him that he would send him wheat seeds. Unfortunately, he died in May. He was unable to receive the seeds that Lysenko sent. Of course, he was also unable to increase wheat production. His clansmen erected a stone statue for him in the Cossack capital, with a millet leaf engraved under the statue, with his name and dates of birth and death (1881-1944) chiseled on it. His fellow villagers built a tall white tomb for him locally to commemorate his achievements. From his millet seeds, breeding experts at the Aral Experimental Station selected two excellent millet varieties, one named Bairseyev Millet and one named Gevardsk Millet. The latter grows taller than people and commemorates the heroes of the 28th Guards who mutually guaranteed to complete the task with Bairseyev. Now, all the Cossack farmers are planting these two varieties and are recalling Bairseyev's achievements. Many of their millet production increase groups are named Bairseyev Groups. The millet production increase movement, called the Bairseyev Movement, has been widely launched throughout the Cossack region.

　　苏联谷子（粟）增产英雄
    白尔西叶夫（下）
    杨开道
    当白尔西叶夫去莫斯科领受列宁勋章的时候，他到列宁科学院去看李森科。他首先便问：“谷子产量最高限度是多少？我们所走的谷子增产道路的终点在那里”？李森科回答：“我们伟大的苏联农业科学家威廉士曾经说过，谷物每公顷的最大可能产量为二百公担。他的估计是以太阳热能和作物吸收能力为根据的。虽然许多人都认为威廉士的估计太高了，有点放诞无稽，而我（李森科本人）认为威廉士的理论是对的。不过理论是理论，事实是事实，一直到现在，还没有人达到过威廉士的理想限度。而你的增产成绩，已是农业史上最高成绩了。”他们两人继续谈心。他告诉李森科院长，他改良谷子品种办法和经过。也提到栽培管理情形。他如何和农业指导员主张冲突，他在下种后又把地镇压了一次，指导员认为不对。李森科告诉他，旧农业教科书是反对下种后镇压土地的，可是在风大地区，不镇压是比较容易干燥的，而镇压是可以帮助保存土中水分的。他又告诉李森科院长，农业指导员告诉大家，除了化学肥料之外，一切牛粪，羊粪，鸡粪都要充分利用。而他们游牧民族以前是不使用畜粪肥田的。李森科告诉他，以前游牧民族所种的田地是肥沃的处女地，所以不必使用畜粪。同时，牲畜到处游牧，农人也无法积肥，今后是应该两者并用的。
    一九四一年苏德战事正在激烈进行，各地谷子增产工作都受到战事的影响而停顿了，可是白尔西叶夫的谷子增产小组，仍然继续活动。一般产量又提高了一些。四公顷的高级增产区，竟获致了一五五·八公担的新纪录（每亩二千○七十七斤）。这年秋天，战事转紧。莫斯科和列宁格勒都受到严重的威胁。为慰劳前线战士起见，全国各地掀起劳军运动。白尔西叶夫的农场自然也有相当的捐献。而他本人又单独呈献三五○普特（一万零九百斤）。他们的慰劳品是预定献给列宁格勒战士们的。可是，列宁格勒当时被德寇四面包围，所以他们所献的几列车小米，就先运到莫斯科，由列宁格勒区党部书记代表接受。有一部分是运到斯维尔前线去了。他们组织有一个献粮代表团。白尔西叶夫也是献粮代表之一。他们不但随粮到莫斯科，而且也到斯维尔前线去观战。在那里，生产的战士和武装的战士碰见了，彼此互相慰问，互相勉励。战士们保证要把德寇赶走，农民们保证要更加努力生产，以保证军粮的供给。当他们谈到白西叶尔夫谷子增产成绩的时候，大家都以稀奇而怀疑的眼光望着他。他告诉这些战士们，虽然壮丁差不多都出发参军了，他自己的儿子也在前线，后方的生产并没有松懈的。相反的，大家正在更紧张的工作。妇女代替了壮丁的岗位，而且一个人做两个人的事，老年人也不休息了，变年青了，有用了。他自己已经过了六十岁，他在工作中从没有一分钟的休息。他们在莫斯科听到许多战士们英勇牺牲事实，非常感动，决定将要加倍努力，继续增产，为祖国服务，为人民服务。
    一九四二年他们普通增产区三十八公顷（五百七十亩）产量是每公顷一○五公担（每亩一千四百斤），而高级增产区则为一七五公担（每亩二千三百三十三斤）。他个人又捐献了五万卢布劳军，斯大林大元帅曾复电申谢。他在报纸上发表声明，定要再度提高产量，以答谢斯大林对他的关注。许多朋友都劝他，他的成绩已经非常之高了，再高是不容易的。他回答他们：“难道比坚守列宁格勒还难些吗？”许多朋友和社会主义竞赛对手，都来看他，和他交换意见，向他要些种子，他都毫无吝啬，一切都坦白告诉他们。一九四二年冬小组全部人员大家参加选种工作。他们的种子本来已经很好，很大。精选后的种子更好更大。一千粒种子普通重量不足五克（约一分五厘），而他们选出的种子，则有七八克重（二两三分四厘）。他又寻找到了一块四十公顷（六百亩）的肥沃处女地，下层为黑钙土，上层有羊粪甚多（以前可能是一个牧羊地），作为他们的增产地。又从其中划出最优良的四公顷（六十亩），作为高级增产区。他们在一九四三年春天，开始挖水沟，一共挖了六十万方公尺土方。个别农民每天有挖十八方公尺土方者。虽然如此劳苦，大家仍然是很高兴地干。在高级增产区，他们又多加一些功夫，还多上了一些粪。
    农场主席含笑问他，谷子告诉你些什么？何时它需要喝水？白尔西叶夫回答说：“我找到了答案，是李森科启发我的。在酷热天气，人喝水是急的，在凉爽天气，人喝水是缓的。水喝急了是不好的。慢慢的喝才有味，才有用。我想作物也是同样的。去岁我发现，在晚上或一早灌水的田地，其收成要比日里炎热时候灌水的要好些。”他们决定天晴日里不灌水，一定要等太阳下山才开始灌水，到了第二天早上又停止。这个秋天，德军节节败退，苏军开始反攻。他们的小米田也胜利的收获了。普通增产区虽然只有每公顷八○公担（每亩一千零六十六斤）产量，而高级增产区则为二○一公担（每亩二千六百八十斤），突破了苏联农业科学大师威廉士的预期最高可能产量。许多穗子有谷粒一千五百颗之多，有少数有三千粒之多。也就是说一粒谷子在一年之内，可以增加一千五百倍乃至三千倍。他们一组共有十人，共生产了二千八百多公担谷子（五十六万斤），每人有二百八十多公担（五万六千斤）。另外，还共同种有四公顷的蔬菜，瓜、果和马铃薯。除了每人应得的工作日报酬以外，他们还得到四百七十余公担（九万四千斤）的谷物奖励。这个奖励，他们全部献给苏维埃红军了。他们彼此都履行了去年保证要作的工作。武装战士们把德寇全部打跑了；生产战士们，把产量再度提高。
    当各地礼炮隆隆庆祝乌克兰首都基辅解放之日，白尔西叶夫同时收到了李森科院长向他道贺的信，夸奖他的生产成绩，说是世界上最高的谷子生产纪录。他笑了：“我们的谷子成绩，也有科学的价值了。”一九四四年春天，他再度来到莫斯科，又到列宁农业科学院去看李森科。李森科就说：“我深信谷子是一种高产量作物，这是你已经用事实证明了的。这是一件老教授们认为不可能的事，他们在编写教科书的时候，一致认为谷子是一个低产量的作物，现在他们必需改写他们的教科书了。”白尔西叶夫回答说：“这是对的。”不但他获得谷子高产量，其他千千万万农民也获得了高产量。他们一个邻近谷子增产女组长，造成了一七五公担纪录。他有一个亲戚，造成二○三公担纪录。另外，还有一个谷子增产组长，造成二○六公担纪录。不过他们的生产面积是不大的。白尔西叶夫开了路，许多人都在跟着向前走，他衷心快乐极了。如果他还能活下去，他必定再设法提高产量。李森科问他如何再度提高产量？他主张行株距一样大，将播种量略为减低，使每株产量由六克（一分八厘）增至八克（二分四厘）。当然，要多施肥，他们可以多施羊粪和鸡粪。他又说，在里海的风暴以后播种，是要比在其前要好些。他征询李森科意见，李森科回答说：“我只有向你学习，而没有什么可以贡献你的。”于是李森科送了他一本列宁农业科学院战时工作报告，亲笔题书下面的话：
    最伟大的科学家估计谷物产量每公顷不可能超过二百公担，这是根据作物所可能吸收的太阳热能计算的。你的生产成绩超过了这个估计，证明了作物产量是由人决定的。
    荣誉归于史无前例的最高生产者。
    我祝你健康，祝你长寿！
    李森科
    一九四四年四月六日
    他向李森科告辞了。李森科送他出来，亲自替他穿上外衣。他向李森科最后嘱咐：“你答应送我的冬小麦，不要忘了。我将在我们那个干燥寒冷区域，争取良好的小麦生产纪录。”李森科答应他，是会寄给他小麦种子的。可惜到了五月，他便去世了。李森科寄去的种子，他没有能收到。当然，也没有能够把小麦产量提高。他的族人，在哥萨克首都替他竖立了一座石像，石像下面刻有一片谷叶子，上面凿着他的姓名和生卒年份（一八八一——一九四四）。他的乡人在本地替他筑了一个高大的白色坟墓，以纪念他的功勋。从他的谷子种子中，阿拉尔试验场的育种专家们，选出了两个优良谷子品种，一个命名为白尔西叶夫谷子，一个命名为格华德斯克谷子。后者长得比人还高，是纪念和白尔西叶夫互相保证完成任务的第二十八护卫队英雄们的。现在，全哥萨克农民都种植这两个品种，都在追忆白尔西叶夫的劳绩。他们的许多谷子增产小组，都命名为白尔西叶夫小组。谷子增产运动，则称之为白尔西叶夫运动，已经在哥萨克全境普遍地展开了。
