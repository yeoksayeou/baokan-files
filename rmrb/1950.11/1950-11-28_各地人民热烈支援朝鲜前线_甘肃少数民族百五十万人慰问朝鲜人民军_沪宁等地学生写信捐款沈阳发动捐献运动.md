People Across the Country Warmly Support the Korean Front Lines
　　1.5 Million Minorities in Gansu Province Express Sympathy to the Korean People's Army
　　Students in Shanghai, Nanjing and Other Places Write Letters and Donate Money; Shenyang Launches a Donation Campaign

[Our Newspaper] People everywhere are concerned about the fighters on the Korean front lines who are resisting American aggression. The movement to express sympathy to the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army is gradually unfolding across the country.

　　Letters of sympathy filled with enthusiasm are being constantly sent from factories, schools, and rural areas. On the 23rd alone, this newspaper received nearly two hundred letters of sympathy requesting that they be forwarded to the Korean front lines.

　　The 1.5 million people of various ethnic groups in Gansu Province, including Hui, Tibetan, Mongolian, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Dongxiang, wrote a letter on the 11th to General Kim Il-sung and the Korean People's Army, expressing their respect and sympathy. They also proposed to strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups, suppress counter-revolutionary activities, and fully support the just and heroic struggle of the Korean people, giving the American imperialist aggressors a merciless blow. Employees of the Zhenhua Flour Mill in Wuxi City said in their letter to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army: "Your victory has further inspired our enthusiasm for patriotism and production. We are determined to celebrate your glorious achievements with hard work in production." Eighty-nine young farmers in Wujin County wrote in their letter: "We are ready to put down our hoes and pick up our guns at any time to go to the front lines and support you."

　　In Beijing, many factories are finding it difficult to keep up with the work of collecting gifts of sympathy due to the enthusiastic donations from their employees. Workshops at the 70th Ordnance Factory repeatedly called the trade union urging: "We have a lot more gifts of sympathy here. If you don't come and collect them soon, we will send them directly to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions." The 58 sympathy bags from textile workers in Wuxi City are filled with daily necessities such as towels, soap, and notebooks, with the words "Please record the number of enemies you eliminate each day in your notebooks."

　　In Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, in addition to eagerly requesting to go to the front lines to provide services, the villagers are also actively donating dried vegetables. The county has already donated more than 300,000 catties of dried vegetables. At the Northeast Business College's meeting to Resist America and Aid Korea, Protect the Home and Defend the Country, students such as Hu Yousheng and Zhou Shiqi donated large sums of cash, ten gold rings, and one watch on the spot.

　　Zhang Jinru, manager of the Tianjin branch of Jufeng Hua Firm, a patriotic industrialist and businessman in Tianjin, donated 50 million yuan, with 30 million yuan for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and 20 million yuan for the Korean people.

　　To keep the soldiers warm, more than 4,000 female students, more than 700 female teachers, more than 1,000 students from women's spare-time schools, as well as female cadres and housewives, in Jinan City are actively rushing to make 200,000 sets of military uniforms. Male students from Bethune Medical College are also helping out, and have put forward the slogan "Sew quickly, sew well, and ensure that soldiers wear new cotton-padded jackets."

　　The 1,200 family members of revolutionary martyrs and laboring women at the Shijiazhuang Clothing and Food Factory are working hard to make 70,000 military quilts. They come to the factory before dawn, talking about how they should postpone their own work so that the soldiers at the front would not be cold.

　　Young workers and members of the Communist Youth League at the Wuhan Nanyang Tobacco Factory actively participated in Sunday voluntary labor and mobilized more than 100 family members to make cotton-padded clothes for the Volunteer Army. Peng Yuxian's Youth League group of eight people made four pieces on the first day, and enclosed a letter in the first cotton-padded coat, saying: "The weather is getting cold now. In addition to actively producing to support you, we voluntarily take the time to make some cotton-padded clothes for you. We hope you will be warm and kill more enemies."

　　After hearing that the weather in northern Korea had dropped to minus 20 degrees, employees of various agencies and organizations in Shenyang City donated winter clothing. As of the 21st, more than 20,000 pieces of leather clothing, cotton clothing, cloaks, hats, down quilts, and shoes have been donated. Employees of the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government donated 400 pairs of cotton-padded leather shoes (each pair worth about 1 million Northeast currency), 2,000 new sanitary shirts, 300 military blankets, and 450 sets of yellow cotton-padded clothing. The cotton-padded jackets sent by the Northeast Sanlian Bookstore also had the words: "Completely and thoroughly eliminate the American and Li bandits."

　　Female cadres and teachers and students of adult night schools at the Beijing Third Cultural Center are actively sewing cotton gloves. The cotton gloves made by workers in the Chinese medicine industry in Beijing's Fourth District are all sewn with straps.

　　Teachers at Shanghai Jiaoye Middle School suggested that the education sector donate a "Chinese Teacher" airplane. Various groups have launched challenges, with each person donating 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. All teachers and students of Hengshan County Middle School in Hunan Province initiated the donation of a "Hunan Youth" fighter plane. As of the 13th, 448,000 yuan had been donated.

　　Many people regard this donation movement as a regular task and are prepared to continue it until the end of the Korean War. Tian Lun, of the Health Department of the General Office of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, will donate 100 catties of millet every month starting this month. Workers at the Housheng Match Factory in Beijing's Fourth District and the printing factory of the Political Department of the North China Military Region are prepared to donate 30 to 60 catties of millet per month.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 27th. Many students in Shanghai, Nanjing and other cities have written letters and donated money to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army who are resisting America and aiding Korea.

　　In Shanghai, students from many schools have voluntarily donated money and goods. Many primary school students are willing to give up eating sweets and donate the money. Young Pioneers from the Muslim School in the Old Zha District donated 280,000 yuan of their saved candy money. Teachers and students of the National School in the 20th District donated money that could buy one hundred hand grenades.

　　In Nanjing, students from Nanjing University, Jinling University, Jinling Women's University, and various middle and primary schools wrote letters of condolence to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. The letters revealed their infinite love for the heroic fighters of China and Korea. Xiao Lizhong, a student at Central Road Elementary School in the city, wrote in a letter to "Uncle Volunteer Army": The American devils used to beat us primary school students in Nanjing. Now they are going to beat Korean primary school students again. It's really hateful! You and your Korean comrades are beating those dogs, which is protecting our children. We will study hard to express our gratitude to you. Deng Jiawan, a student at Yuhua Road Elementary School, also gave "Uncle Volunteer Army" a diary, asking them to record their glorious deeds of heroic struggle.

　　Students from various schools in Fuzhou City have launched a movement to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. Xu Yan, a student from the city's First Central Elementary School whose father was killed by an American-made bandit plane this summer, launched a movement in the school to donate a meal of rice and write a letter of condolence. He said angrily: I will never forget the hatred of the American-made bandit plane killing my father. Although I am still young and cannot go to the front to kill the enemy, I will save two days of food to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, and ask them to kill dozens more American devils to avenge my father and to avenge all the children in China and Korea whose fathers and mothers were killed! More than 800 children in the school were deeply moved and responded to his call. They donated 500,000 yuan, 82 catties of rice, and wrote 637 letters of condolence in two days. On the 24th, they beat gongs and drums and sent the comfort items to the Fujian Daily, entrusting the newspaper to forward them to the Fujian Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression.

　　Students from various schools in Wuhu, Southern Anhui, and Yangzhou, Northern Jiangsu, also wrote letters of condolence and made comfort bags for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Dai Shuhua, a student at Wuhu Lihua Jin Elementary School, wrote in a letter of condolence: Now the people of the whole country are participating in the movement to resist America and aid Korea, protect the home and defend the country; we all know that the United States is a paper tiger. Only by piercing the skin of this paper tiger can we achieve peace. Students at Shengzhou Middle School in Yangzhou are raising funds and rushing to make comfort bags to comfort the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Korean front lines.
