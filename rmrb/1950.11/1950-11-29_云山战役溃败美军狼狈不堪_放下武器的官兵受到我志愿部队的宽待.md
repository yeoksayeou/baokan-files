Xinhua News Agency, Northern Korea, November 28th: A correspondent from the Korean front reports on the disgraceful defeat of the American invading forces in the Unsan area:

　　The American troops that once occupied Unsan were from the 8th Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division, a mechanized unit. This division was one of the strongest in the American forces invading Korea, but it encountered the Chinese People's Volunteer Army here and suffered a heavy blow.

　　On November 6th, four days after the American army was severely defeated, the correspondent arrived at the battlefield where the regiment was annihilated. The battlefield had been cleared, but several wrecked American tanks still lay there, along with a damaged bulldozer. Beside the tanks, ammunition, oil drums, newspapers, and a baseball bat were scattered haphazardly. Among the things abandoned by the Americans was a folding screen, a "trophy" that the American "GIs" had looted from Korean civilians. There were no American corpses on the battlefield. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army buried the American soldiers who had died for Truman and MacArthur, and at the risk of being strafed by American planes, properly bandaged the wounded American soldiers and sent them to safety.

　　Inside the American Military Positions, Many Letters and Pornographic Pictures Were Discarded

　　The correspondent arrived at the American-built positions on the battlefield. Empty shells from榴弹炮 (榴弹炮/liú dàn pào. Howitzer artillery cannons) were piled high, along with many cans of all sizes. The positions were dug into a village and a ditch beside the road. The position in the village had a large pit in the middle, surrounded by many smaller pits, lined with soft grass. According to the soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who participated in the battle, at the end of the battle, these pits were littered with many letters from home and nude women photos (pornography) of the American soldiers. The reporter read a letter from an American woman to her husband, which read: "Seeing the news, I know the war can end in three weeks. I have made applesauce and pear sauce, waiting for you to come back and eat." Another letter contained a lock of golden hair.

　　Our Volunteer Army Shouted "We Won't Kill Those Who Surrender"; Many American Soldiers Knelt Down to Surrender

　　The soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army talked with great interest about the surrender movements of the American soldiers. They said that the surrender movements of these American soldiers were almost the same: they knelt down, put the rifle around their necks, and then, first movement: hands extended horizontally, second movement: hands raised, the third movement was to hug their heads with both hands and not move anymore. Once, a combat group leader of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army rushed up a mountain alone and encountered a scattered American soldier, and the guy immediately knelt down and asked in broken Chinese: "You, Korean?". The group leader said, "I am Chinese!" The American soldier then said embarrassedly: "China, I've been there." The group leader gestured to him, telling him that those who surrender would not be killed, and gestured for him to call others to surrender as well. As a result, he shouted for a while, and then called five American soldiers to surrender.

　　Scattered American Soldiers Were Starving; They Came Out of the Deep Mountains to Surrender

　　American soldiers had been deceived by propaganda. They had heard that if they were captured, they would be killed with an axe. Therefore, some people, seeing that they could not resist, threw away their backpacks and weapons and ran back, some ran into the deep mountains to hide. But they could not find anything to eat, and when they met the Chinese People's Volunteer Army searching the mountains, they came out to surrender in a state of distress. Once, eight American soldiers hid in the mountains, and could not bear the hunger any longer. They met the searching troops, patted their bellies with their hands, and extended three fingers, looking extremely embarrassed, because they had been hungry for three days. The soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army immediately gave them their rations to eat. Two days later, another four American soldiers ran out under the same circumstances, and the fingers they extended were not three, but five.

　　All the American officers and soldiers who bravely laid down their arms received lenient treatment from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, so they have the opportunity to go home to eat his wife's applesauce and pear sauce, and can also stroke his wife's golden hair, if they were killed, then everything would be over.

　　云山战役溃败美军狼狈不堪
    放下武器的官兵受到我志愿部队的宽待
    【新华社朝鲜北部某地二十八日电】迟到：本社记者自朝鲜前线某地报道美国侵略军在云山地区战斗中溃败的狼狈情形称：
    一度窜踞云山的美国军队是机械化的骑兵第一师第八团的部队。这一个师是美国侵略朝鲜的军队中战斗力最强的部队之一，它在这里碰到了中国人民志愿部队，并且受到了沉重的打击。
    十一月六日，美军被痛歼后的第四天，记者到达了痛歼该团美军的战场。战场是已经清扫过了，可是还有几辆美国军队残破的坦克躺在那里，另外还有一辆打坏了的开山机。坦克的旁边，零乱地丢弃着枪弹、油筒、书报、和一根打棒球用的棍子。在这些美军遗弃的东西中有一扇可以折合的大屏风，美国“大兵”们从朝鲜老百姓家中抢来了这样的“战利品”。战场上已没有美军的尸体。中国人民志愿部队掩埋了这些为杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟牺牲的美国兵，并且冒着美国飞机的疯狂扫射把受了伤的美国兵妥善地包扎好送到了安全的地方去。
    在美军的阵地里面  丢着很多家信淫画
    记者到了这个战场上的美军构筑的阵地。那里高高的堆着榴弹炮炮弹的空筒，与炮弹空筒一起，扔着许多大大小小的罐头筒。阵地是挖在一个庄头上和公路旁的一条沟里。庄头上的阵地是中间一个大坑，周围还有很多小坑，坑里面铺着软草。据参加过这次战斗的中国人民志愿部队的战士说：在战斗结束的时候，这些土坑里面丢散着美国兵的很多家信、裸体女人照片（淫画）。记者读到了一封信，这是一个美国女人写给他丈夫的，信上写着：“看到报上消息，知道战争在三个星期内可以结束。我已经做好了苹果酱，还有梨酱，等待着你回来吃。”在另一封信中，还夹着一束金色的头发。
    我志愿军喊缴枪不杀  许多美国兵下跪投降
    中国人民志愿部队的战士们极有兴趣地谈着美国军队的缴枪动作。他们说，这些美国兵的缴枪动作几乎是一样的，他们跪着，把枪套在脖子上，然后，第一个动作：两手平伸，第二个动作：双手举起，第三个动作就是两手把头一抱，再也不动了。有一次，中国人民志愿部队的一个战斗组长一个人冲上了一座山，碰到一个打散了的美国兵，还个家伙立刻跪下来，用不纯熟的中国话问道：“你，朝鲜人？”，这个组长说：“我是中国人！”美国兵接着狼狈地说：“中国，我去过。”组长向他比手势，告诉他缴枪不杀，并且用手势要他叫别人也来缴枪。结果他大叫了一阵，就叫了五个美国兵来投降。
    溃散美兵饿得不行  从深山里出来投降
    美国兵曾经受了欺骗宣传，他们听说过：被捉住了是要被用斧头砍死的。因此，有些人看见抵不住了，扔掉背包和武器回头就跑，有的跑进深山里去躲起来。可是他们找不到东西吃，一碰见中国人民志愿部队搜山的部队，他们就狼狈不堪地走出来投降。有一次，八个美国兵躲在山中，实在饿得不能支持了，他们遇见了搜山部队，都用手拍着肚皮，伸出三个手指头，表现出极为尴尬的样子，原来他们已经饿了三天了。中国人民志愿部队的战士们立即把自己的干粮送给他们吃。过了两天，另外有四个美国兵也是在同样情况下跑出来，他们伸出的指头不是三个，而是五个了。
    所有勇敢地放下了武器的美国官兵都受到了中国人民志愿部队的宽待，他们就有机会回家吃到他妻子的苹果酱、梨酱，也可以抚摸他妻子的金发，如果是打死了，那么，一切也就完了。
