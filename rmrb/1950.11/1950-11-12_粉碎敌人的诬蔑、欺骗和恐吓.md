　　Crush the Enemy's Slander, Deception, and Intimidation
    Our people's volunteer army's great and just action in Korea to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country has quickly won the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life in China. Patriotic people everywhere continue to submit applications to join the volunteer army with fervent enthusiasm every day. Letters paying tribute to the People's Volunteer Army and pledging to contribute their lives to support the great and just action of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country are pouring in like snowflakes. The sacred will of 475 million people has become a great force that no power can overcome.
    The defeated American imperialist aggressors, represented by MacArthur and Austin, have issued shameless slanders, deceptions, and intimidations against the just actions of the Chinese people. This is not surprising at all. Like the shameless American aggressors previously slandering the Korean people for "invading" Korea and the Chinese people for "invading" Taiwan and Tibet, they are now slandering the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, which is resisting American interference and aggression, as "interveners" and "invaders." The aggressors are trying their best to put on a harmless face and declare that they do not intend to "invade" China. But they then threaten that "the current conflict may not be limited to the Korean region" because they will not "tolerate this barely disguised invasion of Korea."
    The spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a solemn refutation of these slanders, deceptions, and intimidations of the American aggressors in yesterday's statement. This refutation correctly reflects the will of the people of the whole country.
    The enemy's slanders, deceptions, and intimidations will continue to emerge endlessly, becoming an indispensable supplement to the enemy's military aggression. Therefore, the people of the whole country must be fully mentally prepared to give crushing blows to these ideological poisons spread by the enemy at any time.
    The enemy's attempt to slander our people's volunteer action in Korea as "intervention" or "aggression" is absurd and ridiculous. There have been many times of intervention and aggression in history, and there have also been many times of people's volunteer actions. No one has ever confused them. To use the most famous example, the armies of Hitler and Mussolini intervened in the Spanish Civil War to help Franco attack the Spanish people. This was undoubtedly intervention. Conversely, the people of Britain, France, the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries armed themselves to help the Spanish people resist Franco. This was undoubtedly a people's volunteer action. Even the Americans admit that today's Korea is just like Spain at that time. The armies of the United States, Britain, Canada, and other countries are interveners just like Hitler and Mussolini. The American army had no reason to go to Korea at all, because Korea only had an internal dispute within a country. But in fact, the American army not only entered Korea to help the public enemy of the Korean people, Syngman Rhee, slaughter the Korean people, but also openly became the commander of Syngman Rhee's army. Even Hitler and Mussolini did not do what the American government has done. The American government has also surpassed Hitler and Mussolini in the following two things. First, no matter how ferocious and shameless Hitler and Mussolini were, they did not declare that the Spanish Republican government had "invaded" Franco, but the American government actually declared that the Korean people had "invaded" Syngman Rhee. Second, no matter how ferocious and shameless Hitler and Mussolini were, they did not declare that the volunteer forces of the people of Britain, France, the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries had "intervened" in the Spanish Civil War or "invaded" Spain, etc., but the American government actually declared that the Chinese people had "intervened" in Korea or "invaded" Korea, etc. But as the spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated, this kind of black-and-white nonsense of the American government cannot erase the public right and wrong of all mankind. All such slanders can only further arouse the patriotic indignation of our people.
    The enemy is trying to deceive our people, saying that the United States will not invade China and that it will "stop when appropriate." The meaning is to tell us Chinese people that we can ignore the American invasion of Korea. But if we are not forgetful, we will know that in the bloody history of imperialists invading China for more than a hundred years, when has there ever been a "stop"? Wasn't each invasion quickly turning the "end point" they reached into a "starting point" for a new invasion? The imperialists' dictionary only has "an inch, then a foot," and "having taken Long, longing for Shu." There is no such thing as "stopping when appropriate" at all, unless we use force to stop him and make him "have to stop." As for today's America, it has not only invaded Korea, China's close neighbor, threatening China's border, but has also long invaded our Taiwan with its navy and invaded our Northeast with its air force. Why do MacArthur and Austin and the like avoid talking about such obvious facts? People cannot "appease" or "pray" to wolves that threaten their survival; if you don't hit it, it will bite you. There is no third way.
    The enemy is also trying to intimidate our people, saying that if our people insist on justice, the war will spread beyond Korea and China will get into trouble. Of course, the Chinese people never want war, but want peace. Therefore, the Chinese people advocate a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. But have the imperialists shown the slightest desire for peace? No! On the contrary, the imperialists have already brought the war to us, to our Taiwan and Northeast. Our people are willing to engage in peaceful construction. The Central People's Government has only been established for just over a year, and it has already made such great achievements. Wouldn't it be better if we could win a few more years to build the country well? But the problem now is not that we don't want peaceful construction, but that American imperialists don't let us have peaceful construction. Who doesn't know that our China's largest industrial base is in the Northeast, and the enemy's bombs have already been dropped on our Northeast? Now, if our people do not take active action to resist America and aid Korea, then how can the industrial centers of Andong, Benxi, Fushun, Shenyang, Anshan, Dalian, etc., be built under the threat of enemy fire? Who doesn't know that China and North Korea are as interdependent as lips and teeth. If the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold, and if the house is broken, the hall is in danger!? If we sit idly by and watch our neighbors perish without helping them, we will not be able to save ourselves, and we will be even less able to defend world peace.
    Some reactionary newspapers in the United States have begun to use superior weapons and even atomic weapons to intimidate our people. Of course, we firmly oppose the use of inhumane atomic weapons, but we are not afraid of it, nor are we afraid of any superior weapons. Anyone with a little historical common sense knows that in the struggle between revolutionary people and counter-revolutionary rulers or aggressors, the enemy's weapons and military technology are usually far superior to the people's at the beginning. The situation in the Chinese People's Liberation War was like this, and the situation in the Soviet-German War was also like this. Around the July 7th Incident, sufferers of "fear of Japan" used the fact that the Japanese invaders had airplanes, cannons, and poison gas to intimidate us; the Japanese robbers also used these so-called superior weapons in the war of aggression against China; Chiang Kai-shek used all his superior weapons in the anti-people war; Hitler also used all his weapons in the Soviet-German War, but the final victory was for the Chinese people, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Soviet people and the Soviet army, not Chiang Kai-shek, Tojo, and Hitler bandits. As for atomic weapons, Stalin and Comrade Mao Zedong had already clearly told us that "atomic bombs cannot determine the fate of war" and that "atomic bombs are paper tigers." Even imperialist elements Chennault, Mountbatten, and others have confessed this one after another. When Japan surrendered in 1945, Chennault said: "The Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan was the decisive factor in accelerating the end of the war. Even if the atomic bomb had not been dropped, the result would have been the same." Mountbatten also said: "It is a big mistake to think that the atomic bomb will stop the Far Eastern war." Moreover, the atomic bomb is not now exclusively owned by the United States. The Soviet Union has long announced that it has atomic bombs, and Vyshinsky recently warned the imperialists that "bombs can be retaliated with bombs," and "if it is unfortunately needed, we will have as many atomic bombs as necessary." People who regard atomic weapons as omnipotent should think about who is most afraid of atomic bombs, the Soviet Union, which spans Europe and Asia, and China, which has a vast area and a dispersed population, or New York, Washington, and London, which have a highly concentrated population? This should be the most clear in the minds of the imperialist war-mongers.
    The Chinese people are not believers in weapons alone. If we investigate, the ancestor of those who believe in weapons alone, the ancestor of those who scare people with superior weapons, then he is not a modern figure, but the "barbaric and ignorant" Qin Shihuang. After he annexed the six countries and unified China, in addition to his own troops retaining the most superior weapons at the time, he collected all the weapons in the world and cast them into golden men, thinking that as long as he did this, his empire could be passed on for generations and generations, no matter how the people opposed it; however, as a result, "not the second generation" was overthrown by the revolutionary peasants led by Chen Sheng, Wu Guang, and others with wooden sticks. Since Chen Sheng and Wu Guang, the Chinese people have understood a truth, that is, what determines the fate of history is living people, not dead iron. Therefore, you robbers who scare people with "superior" weapons! Put up your hands and put down your weapons! Your era has long passed, and your fate will not necessarily be longer than Qin Shihuang's! Now we love peace, but you insist on war. Look, if you dare to attack China, you will not only serve as obligatory transportation teams for us like Chiang Kai-shek in the past, but you will also quickly bury yourselves! Are you not convinced? Eloquent facts will make you kneel down and surrender.
    The Chinese warriors dare to aid the Korean people with volunteer actions, which shows that the Chinese people are not afraid of the American aggressors. The Chinese people have long regarded American imperialists as nothing more than "paper tigers." Yes, the American aggressors have entered the northern half of Korea, but what is so strange about this? I ask who does not know, and who can deny the common sense that "the final victory is the real victory"? What is so great about the gang of robbers led by the United States who stole the banner of the "United Nations" temporarily "driving the main force of the so young Korean People's Army back to North Korea"? During the Anti-Japanese War, didn't Japan occupy the main areas of our country? Didn't Hitler fight all the way to Stalingrad, Leningrad, and near Moscow? But at that time we said that they were just paper tigers, and in the end, ironclad facts proved one by one that they were paper tigers. The paper tiger we are referring to is in terms of the essence of the enemy's power. German and Japanese fascists during World War II were the strongest of the imperialist countries at the time. They were indeed paper tigers, but they were much more combative than the American paper tiger. They had also won many so-called "brilliant victories" in the war. The "victory" MacArthur has now won in Korea is simply insignificant compared to the victories of his predecessors at the time. MacArthur was just a defeated general who fled in the face of the Japanese invaders at that time. At that time, some reactionaries arbitrarily said that "the Soviet Union will perish" and "China will perish," but in the end, it was not the Soviet Union or China that was destroyed, but the three fascist countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan. After World War II, among the imperialist powers, only Britain and France, which were riddled with diseases and weakened, and the paper tiger America remained. Originally, there were seven major imperialist countries, but now only these three that are terminally ill and half-dead remain. And the strength of the world's peace and democracy forces, led by the Soviet Union, is incomparably greater than it was at any time in the past. During World War II, the Soviet army annihilated more than 12 million troops of the German and Japanese fascists and their vassal states; the Chinese People's Liberation Army has annihilated more than 8 million reactionary troops of Chiang Kai-shek, who was armed by American imperialism. China and the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries not only represent the justice of mankind, but China and the Soviet Union alone already possess more than one-third of the world's population. The combined strength of the people of the two countries will be invincible in the world. The strength of the world peace and democracy camp, led by the Soviet Union and with the friendly alliance of mutual assistance between China and the Soviet Union as the backbone, not only greatly exceeds and overwhelms the enemy, but is also developing and growing by leaps and bounds. This force is enough to defend peace and is also enough to defeat any adventurous aggressors.
    Our people love peace and have the power to defend peace. What we demand is still a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and it is still the construction of our country in a peaceful environment. These are the ultimate goals of our people's volunteer action to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. This great and just struggle cannot be slandered, deceived, or intimidated by the enemy. All the enemy's conspiracies and all adventures will inevitably be crushed by our people and the people of the world!

### 粉碎敌人的诬蔑、欺骗和恐吓

　　粉碎敌人的诬蔑、欺骗和恐吓
    我国人民抗美援朝保家卫国志愿部队在朝鲜的伟大正义行动，迅速获得了全中国各阶层人民的热烈拥护。各地爱国人民每天都以沸腾的热情继续提出参加志愿部队的申请。向人民志愿部队致敬、宣誓为了支持抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大正义行动而不惜贡献生命的信件有如雪片飞来。四万七千五百万人民的神圣意志，已经成了任何强力都不能战胜的伟大力量。
    受到打击的美国帝国主义侵略者，以麦克阿瑟和奥斯汀为代表，向中国人民的正义行动发出了无耻的诬蔑、欺骗和恐吓。这是完全不足为奇的。厚颜的美国侵略者如同以前诬蔑朝鲜人民“侵略”朝鲜，中国人民“侵略”台湾西藏一样，又在诬蔑反抗美国干涉和侵略的中国人民志愿部队为“干涉者”和“入侵者”了。侵略者竭力装作无害的面孔宣布他们并不打算“侵略”中国。但是随着又恐吓说：“目前的冲突可能不限于朝鲜区域”，因为他们不会“容忍这种稍加掩饰的入侵朝鲜的行动”。
    对于美国侵略者的这些诬蔑、欺骗和恐吓，我国外交部发言人在昨天的声明中作了严正的驳斥。这个驳斥正确地反映了全国人民的意志。
    敌人的诬蔑、欺骗和恐吓，以后还会层出不穷，成为敌人军事侵略的一个不可少的补充。因此，全国人民必须有充分的精神准备，准备随时针对着敌人所散布的这些思想上的毒害，给以粉碎的打击。
    敌人企图诬蔑我国人民在朝鲜的志愿行动为“干涉”或“侵略”是荒谬可笑的。历史上有过许多次干涉和侵略，也有过许多次人民志愿行动，从来没有人把它们混淆过。用最著名的事例说，希特勒和墨索里尼的军队干涉西班牙的内战援助佛朗哥进攻西班牙的人民，这是毫无疑问的干涉；相反，英法美苏等国人民武装起来援助西班牙人民抵抗佛朗哥，这是毫无疑问的人民志愿行动。甚至美国人也承认在今天的朝鲜正和当时的西班牙一样。美国以及英加等国的军队是和希特勒、墨索里尼一样的干涉者。美国军队本来毫无理由开到朝鲜，因为朝鲜仅仅存在着一个国家的内部的争执。但是事实上美国军队不但开入朝鲜帮助朝鲜人民公敌李承晚屠杀朝鲜人民，而且公然成为李承晚军队的指挥者，这样，就连希特勒、墨索里尼对佛朗哥都没有做过的，美国政府也做出来了。美国政府在下面两件事上也超过了希特勒和墨索里尼。第一，希特勒、墨索里尼无论怎样凶恶无耻，他们也没有宣布西班牙共和政府“侵略”了佛朗哥，而美国政府居然宣布朝鲜人民“侵略”了李承晚。第二，希特勒、墨索里尼无论怎样凶恶无耻，他们也没有宣布英法美苏等国人民的志愿部队是“干涉”了西班牙内战，“入侵”了西班牙等等，而美国政府居然宣布中国人民“干涉”了朝鲜，“入侵”了朝鲜等等。但是正如我国外交部发言人声明所说，美国政府这种颠倒黑白的胡说八道，究竟不能抹煞全世界人类的公是公非。一切这样的诬蔑，只能更加激起我国人民的爱国义愤罢了。
    敌人企图欺骗我国人民，说美国不会侵略中国，它会“适可而止”。意思就是告诉我们中国人民，对于美国侵略朝鲜可以置之不理。但是我们如果不健忘，就会知道，百余年来帝国主义者侵略中国的血史，什么时候曾经有过“止”境？那一次的侵略，不是把他们所到达的“终点”很快就变为新的侵略的“起点”？帝国主义者的词典中有的只是“得寸进尺”“得陇望蜀”，根本没有所谓“适可而止”，除非我们用力量制止他，使他“不得不止”。至于今天的美国，它不但已经侵略了中国的紧邻朝鲜，威胁着中国的边境，而且早已用海军侵略了我们的台湾，用空军侵略了我们的东北了。麦克阿瑟和奥斯汀之流，为什么避而不敢谈到如此彰明较著的事实呢？人对于威胁自己生存的狼，是不能“怀柔”或“祈祷”的；你不打它，它就咬你。此外没有第三条路。
    敌人又企图恐吓我国人民，说如果我国人民坚持正义，战争就要扩及朝鲜以外，中国就会惹祸上身。当然，中国人民是决不希望战争，而是希望和平的。因此，中国人民才主张和平解决朝鲜问题。但是帝国主义者是否表现了丝毫的和平愿望呢？没有！相反的，帝国主义者已经把战争引到我们的身上，引到我们的台湾和东北来了。我国人民是愿意从事和平建设的，中央人民政府成立才不过一年，就有了现在这样大的成绩，如果我们能争取几年时间，把国家建设好了，岂不更好？但是现在的问题不是我们不想和平建设，而是美国帝国主义者不让我们和平建设。谁不知道，我们中国的最大工业基地是东北，而敌人的炸弹却已经向我们的东北投了进来？现在我国人民如果不以积极的行动抗美援朝，那么安东、本溪、抚顺、沈阳、鞍山、大连等工业中心在敌人的炮火威胁下，还如何能够建设？谁不知道中朝两国唇齿相依，“唇亡则齿寒”，“户破则堂危”！？我们如坐视邻人危亡而不救，也就不能自救，也就更谈不到保卫世界和平。
    美国的有些反动报纸已经开始用优越武器以至原子武器恐吓我国人民。我们当然坚决反对使用惨无人道的原子武器，但是我们却决不害怕它，也不害怕任何优越武器。稍有历史常识的人都知道，在革命的人民与反革命的统治者或侵略者的斗争中，开始时期敌人的武器和军事技术通常总是大大优越于人民的。中国人民解放战争的情况是如此，苏德战争中的情况也是如此。在七七抗战前后，恐日病者曾以日寇有飞机、大炮和毒气来恐吓我们；日本强盗在侵华战争中也都使用了这些所谓优越的武器；蒋介石在反人民战争中使用了他所有的优越武器；希特勒在苏德战争中也使用了他所有的武器，但是最后胜利的却是中国人民、中国人民解放军和苏联人民与苏联军队，而不是蒋介石、东条和希特勒匪徒。至于说到原子武器，那么，“原子弹不能决定战争的命运”“原子弹是纸老虎”，这不但是斯大林和毛泽东同志早已明确告给了我们的，连帝国主义分子陈纳德、蒙巴顿等都曾不打自招地先后供认过了。在一九四五年日本投降的时候，陈纳德说：“苏联参加对日战争是使战争加快结束的决定性的因素，即使原子弹没有投掷，结果仍是一样。”蒙巴顿也说：“认为原子弹会停止远东战争是一最大的错误。”况且原子弹现在并不是美国所专有。苏联早已宣布有原子弹，维辛斯基最近警告帝国主义者说“炸弹是可以用炸弹回敬的”，“假若一旦不幸需要原子弹时，我们将会有必需的那样多的原子弹”。以原子武器为万能的人们，应该想想最怕原子弹的究竟是地跨欧亚二洲的苏联和地区广阔人口分散的中国呢？还是人口高度集中的纽约、华盛顿和伦敦？这在帝国主义战争贩子们的心里应该是最明白的。
    中国人民不是唯武器论者。如果我们查究一下，唯武器论者的老祖宗，以优越武器吓人的老祖宗，那末他并不是什么摩登人物，而是“野蛮无知”的秦始皇。他在吞并六国统一中国之后，除过他自己的部队保有当时最优越的武器外，曾尽收天下的兵器铸为金人，以为只要这样，他的天下就可以不管人民如何反对，都可以传之万世万万世；可是，结果“不二世”就被当时陈胜、吴广等人所领导的革命农民用木棒打倒了。从陈胜、吴广以来，中国人民就懂得一条真理，就是决定历史命运的是活的人，而不是死的铁。因此，以武器“优越”吓人的强盗们！还是举起你们的双手，放下你们的武器吧！你们的时代早已过去了，你们的命运不见得会比秦始皇长些！现在我们酷爱和平，而你们却偏要战争，看罢，如果你们敢于进攻中国，你们不仅要和过去的蒋介石一样给我们充当义务运输队，而且会很快埋葬了你们自己！你们不服么？雄辩的事实会让你们屈膝授首。
    中国的勇士们敢于以志愿行动援助朝鲜人民，这就表示中国人民决不害怕美国侵略者。中国人民早已认为美国帝国主义者不过是一只“纸老虎”。是的，美国侵略者打进了朝鲜的北半部，但是这有什么奇怪呢？试问谁不知道，又有谁能够否认“最后的胜利才是真正的胜利”这条常识呢？以美国为首的那一伙窃取“联合国”旗帜的强盗们，把如此年青的朝鲜人民军主力暂时“赶回北朝鲜”，有什么了不起？抗日战争中，日本不是曾经占领过我国的主要地区么？希特勒不是曾经打到斯大林格勒以及列宁格勒和莫斯科附近么？但是当时我们说他们不过是纸老虎，最后铁一般的事实都一个个地证明了他们是纸老虎。我们所指的纸老虎乃是就敌人力量的本质来说的。第二次世界大战中的德日法西斯，是当时帝国主义国家中最强的两个。他们固然也是纸老虎，但比美国这只纸老虎的战斗力强得多。他们在战争中也曾经获得过不少所谓“辉煌的胜利”。麦克阿瑟现在在朝鲜所获得的“胜利”，与他的先辈们当时的胜利相比较，简直渺小的不足挂齿。麦克阿瑟只不过是当时在日寇面前望风而逃的一个败将。当时有些反动分子曾武断地说“苏联必亡”、“中国必亡”，但是最后被消灭的既不是苏联，也不是中国，而是德、意、日三个法西斯国家。第二次世界大战以后，帝国主义的大国，只剩下了七痨八伤、衰弱不堪的英法和纸老虎的美国了。原来有七个大帝国主义国家，现在只剩下已经病入膏肓，死了半截的这三个了。而以苏联为首的世界和平民主的力量，与过去任何时期的情况相比，却已经大得不可比拟。苏联军队在第二次世界大战中曾消灭了德日法西斯及其附庸国军队一千二百余万；中国人民解放军已经消灭了由美帝国主义所武装的蒋介石八百余万反动军队。中苏两国和其他人民民主国家不但代表着人类的正义，而且仅仅中苏两国，就已经拥有世界上三分之一以上的人口。两国人民的力量合在一起，将是无敌于天下的。以苏联为首、以友好同盟互助的中苏两国为骨干的世界和平民主阵营的力量，不仅大大地超过和压倒了敌人，而且在飞跃地发展壮大着。这个力量足以捍卫和平，也足以战胜任何冒险的侵略者。
    我国人民是酷爱和平的，也有力量保卫和平。我们所要求的，仍然是朝鲜问题的和平解决，仍然是我国在和平环境下的建设。这些就是我国人民抗美援朝保家卫国的志愿行动的终极目的。这个伟大的正义斗争是敌人所不能诬蔑，不能欺骗，不能恐吓的。敌人的一切阴谋和一切冒险，必然被我国人民和世界人民打得粉碎！
