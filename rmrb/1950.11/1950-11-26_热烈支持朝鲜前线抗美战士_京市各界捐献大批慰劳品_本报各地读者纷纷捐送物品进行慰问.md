　　[This Newspaper News] Recently, this newspaper has received a steady stream of condolence gifts from readers for the Chinese People's Volunteers Against U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and the Korean People's Army. An old man named Shan Letian donated his savings of fifty units of savings certificates for his old age and vowed to be frugal in his monthly living expenses and donate the remaining money continuously until the final victory. A 67-year-old retired soldier named Meng Xingkui volunteered to go to the Korean front to kill the enemy, but was afraid that he would not be approved because of his age, so he first saved 100,000 yuan from his living expenses and sent it. Zhang Yunting, Wang Jiajie, Li Baifan and other 22 cadres and patients from Beijing Municipal Third Hospital sent 233,000 yuan in Renminbi, a pocket watch, and two pairs of socks to express their high respect for the frontline soldiers. Xiangzhong Daily forwarded 92,000 yuan in cash donated by all the staff of the Grain Company of Yiyang Special District, Hunan Province, to the Volunteer Army, and Li Jie of the Finance Section of Yiyang Special Commissioner's Office donated it to the Korean People's Army. The People's Government of the 13th District of Beijing Municipality forwarded 40,000 yuan donated by Ma Huchen, a resident of the district, and noted that Ma Huchen said when he donated the money: "I can't hand in public grain, but donating a little money can also increase the strength of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea." Liu Zeren of Beijing Russian College donated a gold ring; Guan Shuyuan, Chen Houzhen and other five people donated three tops, one overcoat and three pairs of trousers; Xiao Jin, Xu Zhongming and other eight people donated 297,200 yuan in Renminbi. Li Jedi, Wang Fulin and other ten people from Group 8 of Class 11 of the Central Tax School sent 50,000 yuan as medical expenses for the Korean People's Army. They also said: The disaster of the Korean people is our disaster. We must do our best to support them, even at the cost of shedding our last drop of blood. Jin Lin of the Accounting Section of Xinhua General Agency donated all of his November allowance of 42,200 yuan. In a letter to this newspaper, he said: "I am a mother with two children and cannot join the Volunteer Army. Now I must first wholeheartedly do my job well and complete my tasks." Meng Xiangji, a student in Class B of the fifth grade of the Second Central Elementary School in the Third District of Beijing, sent 5,000 yuan saved from snack money, and attached a letter to the Anti-American Aid Korea Volunteer Army, saying: Dear uncles of the Chinese People's Aid Korea Volunteer Army: I am a member of the Young Pioneers. I will definitely work hard, study hard, and exercise well to prepare to be your backup. I wish you all the best in quickly driving the enemy into the sea and returning victoriously.

　　This newspaper will send these funds and items to relevant departments for forwarding to the Korean front.
