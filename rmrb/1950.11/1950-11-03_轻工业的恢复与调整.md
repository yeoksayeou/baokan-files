The Restoration and Adjustment of Light Industry
Gong Yinbing

I. China's Light Industry in the Stage of Restoration and Adjustment

"Generally speaking, due to the long-term war and the fact that the war has not yet ended, and due to the lack of necessary preparatory conditions, China's economic undertaking is still only in the stage of recovery." "In fact, China's economic recovery will take three to five years before it can turn to systematic development." This is what Premier Zhou pointed out in his report on National Day this year. For light industry, it is undoubtedly in the stage of just beginning to recover.

China's light industry grew up in the cracks of long-term imperialist aggression and oppression, and under the control of feudal forces and bureaucratic comprador capital. Therefore, it has various characteristics of semi-colonialism, semi-feudalism, and small-scale commodity production. This is reflected in the following characteristics:

(1) The number of factories is large. Except for industries such as cotton textiles that are relatively large-scale, most are small and medium-sized. For example, there are only 308 mechanized leather factories in the country, but there are as many as 3,158 manual leather workshops, according to incomplete statistics. The national soap industry has 903 factories with a total of 7,423 employees, with an average of only eight employees per factory. Workshops or home workshops using simple tools for manual production are common in the cigarette, match, knitwear, towel, carpet, ceramics, stationery, and even rubber and pharmaceutical industries. As for manual weaving, papermaking, oil pressing, and flour milling, they are important side businesses in the vast rural areas. In many similar industries, the coexistence of backward manual production methods and modern machine production methods is also a feature of China's light industry. Because the components of small-scale commodity production in light industry account for a very large proportion, being scattered and unorganized, it naturally forms a rule that it expands rapidly when objective conditions are favorable, and disintegrates when encountering difficulties and blows, making it easy to develop and easy to decline.

(2) Most of China's light industry was built by imperialism or in reliance on imperialism, so it has a strong semi-colonial nature and its development is extremely uneven. Due to the lack of a foundation of heavy industry and chemical industry, many raw materials and equipment have to rely on imports from abroad. There is a lack of organic connection and coordination between various industries, and even between various equipment in the same industry, and a complete industrial economic system cannot be formed. For example, the equipment capacity of looms in the cotton textile industry is one-third lower than the equipment capacity of spindles, and a large amount of cotton yarn still relies on manual weaving; while the wool textile industry has more looms than wool spinning equipment and needs to import wool tops to keep the looms running. The papermaking industry's pulping capacity is smaller than paper-making, and pulp must be imported. The rubber industry has excess equipment for producing rubber shoes, but insufficient equipment for manufacturing tires. The match industry has a production capacity that is more than twice the demand, but most of the match raw materials, potassium chlorate and phosphorus, rely on imports. Even processing industries such as cigarette, flour, and leather, many of their raw materials used to rely on or still rely on foreign supply. This colonial-type dependence and imbalance is the main weakness of China's light industry.

(3) In terms of geographical distribution, the more modernized and large-scale light industries are mostly concentrated in a few large coastal cities. For example, more than seven-tenths of the country's spindles are concentrated in East China, and nearly 60% of the spindles are concentrated in the three cities of Shanghai, Qingdao, and Tianjin. Shanghai and Tianjin account for 47% of the papermaking industry's production capacity. The concentration of industries such as rubber, cigarettes, pharmaceuticals, and enamel in coastal cities is even more significant. In terms of major regions, East China's light industry is the most developed; Central South, Southwest, and Northwest are the most backward. This distribution situation is an unreasonable and deformed state, whether in terms of raw material resources or market sales.

(4) Most light industrial factories are privately owned, and the proportion of publicly owned factories is much lower than that of heavy industry and fuel industry. From the perspective of equipment quantity and production capacity, except for the cotton textile industry, where the proportion of public and private ownership is similar, almost all types of light industry are predominantly privately owned. Therefore, production is often highly blind, and the phenomenon of production and sales being out of sync and supply and demand imbalances frequently occurs. On the other hand, many private enterprises still retain a considerable degree of feudalism. After years of inflation, they have also been tainted with a strong speculative nature; while in the public enterprises, they have not been thoroughly transformed due to their recent takeover from bureaucratic capital, and most lack the experience of modern enterprise management. Therefore, whether public or private light industry, in terms of operation and management, are quite backward. In general, they have not fully utilized their production capacity, product quality is not up to standard, and costs are quite expensive, especially in the Southwest and Northwest regions.

II. Main Contents of Restoration and Adjustment

Based on the inherent defects of China's light industry and its current actual situation, what are the main contents of engaging in restoration and adjustment?

First, it is necessary to determine the production policy. In the past, under the oppression of imperialism and the coercion of feudal bureaucraticism, light industry could not have an independent and autonomous production policy that faced the masses. Many industries were squeezed out by the dumping of foreign goods and could only survive in the cracks. For example, the papermaking industry could not compete with cheap and good-quality foreign newspapers when manufacturing newsprint and could only switch to making tracing paper and wrapping paper. The rubber industry focused on the production of rubber shoes and regarded production materials such as tires and rubber belts as secondary products. Some industries only served a small number of bureaucratic comprador bourgeois and residents of coastal cities, and were divorced from the vast workers and peasants. For example, the pharmaceutical industry produced many expensive tonics, but did not pay attention to ordinary medicines for treating the diseases of workers and peasants. The wool fabrics of the wool textile industry and the silks of the silk textile industry were all for the service of the bourgeoisie and beyond the reach of ordinary people. Some daily necessities industries also had a tendency to simply pursue fancy and luxurious styles, rather than being simple and durable. Among the various light industrial products, very few could be truly adopted by farmers. This detachment of industry from the people restricted its future development. In the future, various light industries must determine the correct production policy, coordinate with the direction of national economic development, serve the vast people, serve agricultural, forestry, industrial, mining, transportation, and other production undertakings, and serve cultural, educational, medical, and health undertakings. China's light industry should replace all foreign goods and meet the needs of the people's daily consumer goods. Those that could not be produced or were not produced enough in the past due to the dumping of foreign goods, such as newsprint, tires, and medicines, and certain chemical raw materials, should now be encouraged to produce boldly. Products that only served a few people in the past should be made to adapt to the needs of the vast people, especially farmers, as much as possible.

Second, gradually strengthen the planning of industry. Because the capitalist and small-scale production components of China's light industry occupy an absolute advantage, there is extreme blindness in production and sales, blind production, blind competition, and blind expansion, forming the morbid development of light industry for many years. To avoid the pain and waste brought about by this blindness, it is necessary to overcome the anarchy in production. There should be organic connections and coordination between regions and between enterprises, and the planning and unity of production should be strengthened to coordinate production and sales to achieve balance. In the struggle to overcome overproduction in the match industry in 1950, we have gained preliminary experience, proving that only by engaging in planned production can we get rid of the panic and pain of blindly competing and encroaching on each other, and steadily recover and move forward. In the future, other light industries must follow the same path.

In socialist state-owned enterprises, the production plan includes detailed plans in all aspects that are closely related and coordinated, such as output, quality, technical quotas, sales, raw material supply, labor, cost, and finance. Although private enterprises cannot yet achieve such specific and in-depth planning, preliminary production plans, production and sales balance plans, and raw material supply plans can be formulated and implemented under the comprehensive leadership of the state-owned economy. The so-called "determining production by sales" does not simply mean producing based on "market sales," but rather to accurately calculate actual needs, formulate production plans, and consolidate production and sales plans as much as possible through methods such as ordering and sales contracts; to combine with trade unions and mobilize workers to implement production plans; and to use collective purchasing, long-term ordering, and other methods to ensure raw material supply plans.

Because the entire economic undertaking is still in the stage of recovery, the construction of light industry must also prevent blind expansion and development. For example, if the production capacity of some industries is already excessive, the establishment of new factories should be postponed, and the expansion of existing equipment should also be postponed. If some equipment in a certain industry is insufficient and some equipment feels excessive, then the latter should be restricted and the former should be encouraged to develop. The construction and development of any light industry should grasp certain key points and policies, and the state plan should play a balancing and guiding role.

Third, strive for self-sufficiency in raw material supply. For China's light industry to develop soundly, it must be self-reliant in raw materials and get rid of its dependence on the imperialist economy. Since liberation, we have made considerable achievements in this area, and the types and quantities of imported light industrial raw materials have been greatly reduced, but we must continue to struggle and strive in the following areas: (1) Balance the equipment and production capacity of various departments of the light industry itself. For example, the papermaking industry must supplement and strengthen pulping equipment to reduce dependence on imported wood pulp. The pharmaceutical, paint, pigment, and other industries should shift from simple processing to finding ways to produce raw materials themselves. The soap industry should increase equipment for extracting glycerin, etc., and use the power of light industry to solve part of the raw material problem. (2) Processing and refining agricultural and mineral products. For example, resources such as sulfur, phosphorus, rosin, mirabilite, and tanning materials are abundant in the country, but due to the lack of processing and refining equipment, the goods are abandoned on the ground and not utilized; even if they are produced, they are of poor quality and do not meet industrial purposes. These agricultural and mineral products only require a small amount of investment, the addition of necessary equipment, and the improvement of technology to be refined in large quantities. Furthermore, the fine selection and classification of domestic wool, the roasting and smoking of tobacco leaves, the papermaking of bamboo and rice straw, and the utilization of rural waste materials such as cottonseed hulls and silkworm cocoons (which can extract Vitamin B) are all worthy of attention and vigorous promotion to supply the raw materials needed by the light industry. (3) The coordinated development of heavy industry. The production tools and means of production for light industry must be fully supplied only when heavy industry has a foundation. Steel, non-ferrous metals, hardware, and mineral products are certainly important, but the relationship between the chemical industry and light industry is particularly close. For example, coal tar by-products are important raw materials for the dye and pharmaceutical industries, and various acids, alkalis, and organic and inorganic chemical raw materials are almost all important raw materials for the light industry, but currently, many of them cannot be produced domestically, or if they are produced, the quantity is insufficient and the quality does not meet the standards. In the future, they should be actively developed in coordination with the needs of the light industry so that heavy and light industries can be closely integrated without being disjointed.

Solving the problem of domestic raw material supply is one of the important tasks of light industry in the next two or three years. Only by achieving basic self-sufficiency in raw materials can the future recovery and development of light industry have a solid and reliable foundation. We need to work hard in this regard.

Fourth, adjust the regional distribution of industry. Most of China's light industry is concentrated along the coast, which is not reasonable from the perspective of national defense security or from the conditions of adapting to raw materials and approaching the market. In the future, we must restore and develop inland industry in a planned and focused manner. The location of any new industry must be carefully considered from all aspects, such as resources, transportation, market, fuel, power, labor, and coordination with other industries, and the most appropriate location should be selected. At the same time, industries that are already on the coast should be encouraged and helped to move to the interior, where there are better development prospects. Of course, due to many existing objective difficulties, adjusting the location of industry is not a simple and easy task, but the trend of national economic development is such, and as long as efforts are made over a considerable period, the current unreasonable industrial distribution will be gradually adjusted to be more reasonable.

Fifth, improve operation and management. The operation and management of China's light industry, whether public or private, are still at a rather backward stage. Public factories have made some progress and achievements after a year of exploration (the Northeast has gained advanced experience due to the longer time), but implementing the economic accounting system and strengthening planning can only be said to be in the beginning and learning stage. Since liberation, most private industrial enterprises have undoubtedly made some improvements in labor-management relations, business methods, and other aspects, and production efficiency has gradually improved. However, some enterprises still maintain bloated organizations, feudal management methods, and speculative dependence habits, and are short-sighted, unwilling, or refuse to carry out reforms. Such enterprises cannot keep up with the progress of the times and are in danger of being eliminated.

In all industries in a new democratic society, it is necessary to give full play to the efficiency of labor production to increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs. This is the basic driving force for promoting the development of industry. For light industry, such a goal of effort is particularly important in order to meet the growing needs of the vast people and to accumulate construction funds for the country.

The scissors gap between the prices of industrial and agricultural products is still quite large. The cost of industrial products is too high (which also includes the problem that the profits of some industrial products are too high), and farmers cannot afford them. Therefore, it is inevitable that the industrial product market will be restricted to a narrow urban circle. To expand the market, in addition to relying on the implementation of land reform in rural areas and the improvement of the rural economy, industry itself must also work hard; reducing costs is an important factor in this. But to achieve the goal of reducing costs, both public and private enterprises must implement a strict economic accounting system on the basis of democratic management. Only by continuously improving democratic operation and management as a central link can we fully exert the potential of industry, rapidly develop productive forces, and at the same time accumulate funds and experience to create the necessary conditions for the future large-scale development of light industry.

Sixth, organize the joint operation and cooperation of small and medium-sized enterprises. As mentioned earlier, one of the characteristics of China's light industry is that small and medium-sized capital and small-scale production methods account for a very large proportion. To organize these scattered and fragmented small and medium-sized industrial productions to reduce their blindness and fragility, joint operation is an effective way. Over the past year, industrial joint operations have been widely promoted in various places, and considerable achievements have been made in helping industrial and commercial enterprises overcome difficulties. Although in specific applications, joint operations may also produce some shortcomings and deviations, general experience shows that joint operations can play a certain role in organizing production, strengthening planning, stabilizing the prices of raw materials or products, saving manpower and material waste, improving the quantity and quality of products, reducing costs, ensuring quality, unifying specifications, and improving technology. In particular, in guiding the combination of the private economy and the state-owned economy, accepting the leadership of the latter, and developing towards the path of state capitalism, joint operations can play a great mediating and organizing role. Therefore, in the process of restoring and adjusting light industry, how to use joint operation organizations more widely and flexibly to help small and medium-sized enterprises overcome difficulties and enable them to move from individual small-scale production methods to collective joint production methods is one of the major issues.

Seventh, improve the technical level of industry. Generally speaking, the technical level of China's light industry is still quite backward, especially for industries located in the interior or developed during the war, with simple equipment and immature technology, resulting in unsalable products that are not welcomed by consumers. Although the technology of some new-style factories in the coastal areas is superior, and some products can be exported and sold abroad (such as cotton textiles, enamelware, thermos bottles, aluminum utensils, and household appliances), the quality specifications also lack uniform standards. Because the product types of light industry are complex, the technology is also multifaceted. In the past, China did not have specialized talent cultivation, and many technologies were accumulated from practical experience. During the restoration and adjustment period, we should strengthen research and experimental work, combine advanced technology with the practical experience of workers, carry out experience exchanges, reward inventions and creations, and promote rationalization proposals. When conditions permit, we should also formulate and implement unified standard specifications, strengthen quality inspection and inspection work, and gradually unify the specifications and quality standards of similar products nationwide to improve and enhance the technical level of the national light industry.

To help light industry get rid of its dependence on foreign countries, finding and discovering substitutes for foreign raw materials in terms of technology and finding ways to manufacture various products that had to be imported in the past is a major and glorious task for technicians.

III. Leadership Work for Restoration and Adjustment

To implement the above restoration and adjustment work for light industry, there must be strong leadership. How should leadership be carried out? I think the following methods should be adopted:

First, concrete and in-depth investigation and research. Chairman Mao said, "No investigation, no right to speak." Only by being familiar with and understanding the industrial situation and problems, and absorbing the opinions and experiences of all parties, and through careful analysis, can we formulate practical and correct policies. However, there is currently no close connection and complete statistics on light industry in various places. To achieve the purpose of understanding the situation and solving problems, convening professional meetings is one of the effective methods. Representatives from various regions and parties can reflect various situations, raise various problems and opinions, and after democratic discussion and research, decide on policies and methods, and the representatives will go back to promote implementation. This is the correct line of "from the masses, to the masses." However, to hold a good meeting, there must be sufficient brewing and preparation before the meeting, and vigorous implementation after the meeting.

Second, establish the necessary statistical system. Without statistical figures, there is no way to understand and calculate the situation in industrial production, and the planned leadership work is also without any basis. However, how to establish a regular and sound statistical system is still a difficult task for the current light industry. Due to the large number of private industrial enterprises and local industrial enterprises, and due to the lack of foundation for past statistical work, we cannot temporarily adopt a complete and complex set of modern statistical forms and reports, but can only focus on the basic situation of major industries and simple production and sales figures, and raw material consumption figures. Doing a good job in this basic statistical work is a prerequisite for the correct leadership work of light industry authorities at all levels.

Third, promote the planning of industrial production. How to promote the planning of industrial production in the process of restoration and adjustment of light industry is an important issue in leadership work. Because most of the light industry is private industry, it will inevitably encounter many obstacles and difficulties. Premier Zhou said: "The capitalist nature of the private economy is contradictory to thorough planning. But here we need to pay attention to: first, in all the most important economic sectors, we already have a strong socialist state-owned economy, and have begun to develop the semi-socialist cooperative economy. Second, the private economy is under the leadership of various forms of the state-owned economy, which also contains the increasingly developed state capitalist economy serving the socialist economy. Because of this, we have reason to say that we can gradually avoid the past anarchy of China's economy and have greater planning." Director Chen Yun also said: "Adjusting the relationship between production and sales is one of the most difficult problems in economic reorganization. Highly planned production is not yet possible, but after commercial speculation is basically controlled, relatively, and preliminarily planned production has become possible, and the phenomenon of production and sales balance should be gradually realized." According to the above instructions, on the one hand, we must recognize the nature of private industry and avoid committing the mistake of acute illness or commandism, and at the same time, we must strengthen the various leaderships of the state-owned economy and patiently and meticulously guide light industry towards planned production.

Fourth, adjust the relationship between public and private sectors and provide guidance to private enterprises. Director Chen Yun said: "The essence of adjusting the relationship between public and private industrial and commercial enterprises is, on the one hand, to establish the leading position of the state-owned economy, and on the other hand, to enable the private capitalist economy to have its place under the leadership of the state-owned economy." The basic principle of adjusting the relationship between the public and private sectors in light industry is also the same. In specific applications, we must encourage the enthusiasm of private management, guide and promote the improvement of operation and management, the coordination of labor-management relations, and the improvement of technology, and appropriately help them solve difficulties. Finally, we must also organize and guide them as much as possible to combine with the state-owned economy and develop in the direction of state capitalism.

IV. Strive for the Restoration and Development of Light Industry

Due to congenital deficiencies and acquired maladjustments, China's light industry still has various defects and difficulties, but its development prospects are extremely broad. China's light industry has many favorable objective conditions: First, China has a domestic market of 475 million people. After the completion of land reform, agricultural production will develop, farmers' purchasing power will increase, and the demand for light industrial products will continue to grow unprecedentedly; while in foreign countries, the industry in most regions is still quite backward. In recent years, China has exported a considerable amount of light industrial products; as long as we strive for it in the future, this part of the market can still be maintained and expanded. Second, China has abundant light industrial raw material resources, such as cotton, wool, silk, hemp, soybeans, tobacco leaves, plant fibers, oils, and mineral, animal, and agricultural products. As long as these resources are vigorously developed and cultivated in the future, they will be inexhaustible. Third, China's light industry already has tens of thousands of large and small factories, of which no less than a thousand are larger in scale and have modern equipment; there are more than one million skilled industrial workers in the national light industry; and there is considerable experience and achievements in production technology. This is a good foundation. On such superior objective conditions and foundations, we must work hard to carry out various adjustments and restoration work within three to five years to prepare the necessary conditions for the future large-scale construction and development of China's light industry.

### 轻工业的恢复与调整

　　轻工业的恢复与调整
    龚饮冰
    一、恢复调整阶段的中国轻工业
    “从全局来说，由于长期的战争和战争还没有结束，并由于缺乏必要的准备条件，中国的经济事业现在还只是处在恢复的阶段”。“事实上，中国的经济恢复将需要三年至五年的时间，然后才能转入有系统的发展”。这是今年国庆节周总理报告中所指出来的。对于轻工业来说，无疑地亦是处在刚开始恢复的阶段。
    中国轻工业是在帝国主义长期侵略压迫的隙缝中，在封建势力和官僚、买办资本支配下成长起来的，因此在它身上，具有着半殖民地性、半封建性和小商品生产的各种特质。这表现在下面几个特点上：
    （一）工厂的数量众多，除棉纺织等工业较具规模外，一般都以中小型居多，如全国机制皮革厂只有三○八家，但手工皮革作坊，据不完整的统计，就有三一五八家之多。全国肥皂工业九○三家，职工总数七四二三人，每厂平均只有八名职工。利用简单工具进行手工生产的作坊或家庭工场，在卷烟、火柴、针织、毛巾、地毯、陶瓷、文具、甚至橡胶、制药工业中都普遍的存在。至于手工纺织、手工造纸、榨油、磨粉等，更是广大农村的重要副业。在很多同一类的工业中，落后的手工生产方式与新式机器生产方式同时并存，也是中国轻工业的特征之一。由于轻工业内小商品生产成份，占据极大比重，散漫而无组织，就自然地形成客观条件有利时，即迅速膨胀，遭受困难打击时，就纷纷瓦解，容易发展也容易衰落的规律。
    （二）中国轻工业大部是由帝国主义或依赖帝国主义建设起来的，因此带有浓厚的半殖民地性，发展极不均衡。由于缺乏重工业和化学工业的基础，很多原料器材都要依赖国外输入。各项工业之间，甚至同一工业的各种设备之间，都缺少有机的联系和配合，不能形成完整的工业经济体系，如棉纺织工业织机的设备能力低于纱锭设备能力三分之一，大量的棉纱还要靠手工织布；而毛纺织工业则织机多于毛纺设备，需要输入毛条来供织机开工。造纸工业制浆的能力小于抄纸，必需输入纸浆。橡胶工业生产胶鞋设备过剩，而制造轮胎设备则不足。火柴工业生产能力大于需要一倍，但火柴原料氯酸钾和磷却大部依赖进口。即使是卷烟、面粉、制革这样的加工工业，其原物料中，过去或现在还有很多需靠外国供应。这一殖民地型的依赖性和不平衡性，是中国轻工业的主要弱点。
    （三）在地域的分布上，近代化较具规模的轻工业，几多数集中在沿海的少数大都市中，如全国纱锭十分之七以上集中在华东区，将近百分之六十的纱锭集中在上海、青岛、天津三市。造纸工业的生产能力，上海、天津二区占百分之四十七。橡胶、卷烟、制药、搪瓷等工业集中沿海都市的情形则更为显著。以各大区域而论，华东轻工业最为发达；中南、西南、西北最为落后。这种分布情况，无论就原料资源和市场运销来讲，都是不合理的畸形状态。
    （四）轻工业工厂以私营为多，公营厂所占比重，远较重工业、燃料工业为低。从设备数量和生产能力上看，除了棉纺织工业中公私比重相仿外，几乎所有各种轻工业，都是私营居多数，因此在生产上往往带着很大的盲目性，而经常发生产销脱节、供求不调的现象。另一方面，很多私营企业还保留着相当程度的封建性，经过了多年通货膨胀，又沾染了浓厚的投机性；而在公营企业方面，亦因从官僚资本中接管未久，有的尚未经过彻底改造，多数则尚缺乏近代化企业管理的经验，因此无论公私营轻工业，在经营管理方面，都相当落后，一般的尚未充分发挥生产效能，产品质量不够标准，成本相当昂贵，这在西南、西北等地区，尤其显著。
    二、恢复调整的主要内容
    根据中国轻工业先天的缺陷和现在的实际情况，从事恢复调整的主要内容是什么呢？
    第一、要确定生产方针  过去轻工业在帝国主义的压迫、封建官僚主义的挟持束缚下，不可能有独立自主、面向大众的生产方针，很多工业受外国商品的倾销排挤，只能在隙缝中苟安偷生，如造纸工业制造新闻纸，就无法与价廉物美的外国报纸竞争，只能改制道林纸、包装纸等。橡胶工业偏重于胶鞋的生产，而把制造轮胎、胶带等生产资料视为次要产品。若干工业则仅为少数官僚买办资产阶级和沿海城市居民服务，而与广大的工农大众脱节，如制药工业生产了很多高贵补品，而对治疗工农大众疾病的普通药品，则不加注意。毛纺织业的呢绒，丝织业的绸缎，都是为资产阶级服务而非平民所能问津。若干日用品工业亦有单纯追求花式的奢侈华丽，不求朴实耐用的倾向。在各种轻工业产品中，真正能为农民采用的实在寥寥无几。这是工业与人民脱离，自己限制了发展的前途。今后各种轻工业决定正确的生产方针，必须配合国家经济的发展方向，为广大的人民大众而服务，为农林、工矿、交通等生产事业而服务，为文化、教育、医药卫生等事业而服务。中国轻工业应该做到代替一切外货，供应人民日常消费用品的需要，过去因外货倾销而无法生产或生产不够的，如新闻纸、轮胎、药品，若干化学原料等，现在应该鼓起勇气大胆生产；过去只为少数人服务的生产品，应该尽量使其适应广大人民特别是农民的需要。
    第二、要逐步加强工业的计划性  由于中国轻工业的资本主义和小生产成份占绝对优势，在产销上就带着极大的盲目性，盲目的生产，盲目的竞争，盲目的扩张，形成了轻工业多年来病态的发展。为了避免这种盲目性所带来的痛苦与浪费，就必须克服生产中的无政府状态。各地区间、各企业间要有机地联系配合，加强生产的计划性与统一性，使产销配合，达到平衡。一九五○年在火柴工业克服生产过剩的斗争中，我们已经取得了初步的经验，证明只有从事有计划的生产，才能摆脱那种盲目竞产、互相倾轧的恐慌和痛苦，稳步的恢复前进。今后别的轻工业也必须走同样的道路。
    在社会主义性质的国营企业中，生产计划包含着产量、质量、技术定额、销售、原物料供应、劳动、成本、财务等各方面密切联系配合的精细计划。私营企业虽然还不可能做到这样具体深入，但初步的生产计划、产销平衡计划、原物料供应计划，在国营经济全面的领导下，是有条件可以制订和实行的。所谓“以销定产”，并不是单纯根据“市场销售”进行生产，而是要精确计算实际的需要，拟定生产计划，并且尽可能用定货、销售合同等方式来巩固产销计划；以结合工会，发动工人，来执行生产计划；用集体采购、长期定货等方式来保证原物料供应计划。
    因为整个经济事业还在恢复的阶段，在轻工业的建设上，也要防止盲目扩充发展，如有些工业生产能力已经过剩，新的工厂就应该暂缓设立，原有设备也要暂缓扩充。若干工业某部分的设备不足，某部分的设备感觉过剩，就应该限制后者而鼓励前者发展。任何轻工业的建设和发展都应该掌握一定的重点和方针，由国家计划起平衡与指导的作用。
    第三、力求原物料供应的自给  中国轻工业要健全发展，必须在原物料上自力更生，摆脱对帝国主义经济的依赖性。解放之后，我们在这方面的努力已有相当的成绩，轻工业原料的进口种类和数量已经大大减少，但还须继续奋斗，在下列各方面努力：（一）轻工业本身各部门设备及生产能力的平衡。如造纸工业须补充加强制浆设备，以减少对国外输入木浆的依赖。制药、造漆、颜料等工业应从单纯的加工转变为设法自制原料。肥皂工业应该增加提炼甘油的设备等等，利用轻工业自己的力量解决一部分原料问题。（二）对农矿产品的加工精炼。如硫磺、磷、松香、芒硝、鞣料等资源，国内蕴藏甚丰，但因缺少加工精炼设备，致货弃于地，未加利用；即或生产，亦因品质粗劣，不合工业用途。这些农矿产品，只须小量投资，添设必要设备，改良技术，即可大量精制。再如国产羊毛的精选分类，烟叶的烤薰加工，竹材、稻草的造纸，以及农村废料棉籽壳、蚕茧（可提炼维他命Ｂ）的利用等，都值得注意大力推行，以供应轻工业所需原料。（三）重工业的配合发展。轻工业的生产工具和生产资料，一定要重工业有了基础，才能充分供应。钢铁、有色金属、五金、矿产品等固然重要，化学工业与轻工业之关系尤为密切，如煤焦油副产品为染料、制药等工业之重要原料，各种酸、碱、有机无机化学原料，几无一不是轻工业之重要原料，而目前国内甚多尚不能生产，或有产而数量不足，质量不合标准，今后亟应配合轻工业之需要，积极发展，轻重工业才能密切结合而不致脱节。
    解决国内原料的供应问题，是这二、三年内，轻工业的重要任务之一，只有做到原料的基本自给，轻工业今后的恢复发展才有坚实可靠的基础，在这方面我们需要好好努力。
    第四、调整工业的区位分布  中国轻工业多数集中沿海，不论从国防安全的观点，或者从适应原料，接近市场的条件看，都是不大合理的，今后我们要有计划，有重点的恢复和发展内地的工业。任何新建工业的区位，都须从资源、交通、市场、燃料、动力、劳力、与其他工业的配合等各方面缜密的考虑，选择最适当的地点，同时已在沿海的工业必要时并应鼓励和帮助它们迁往更有发展前途的内地。当然由于许多客观存在的困难，调整工业区位不是一件简单容易的事，但国家经济发展的趋势是如此，只要经过相当期间的努力，目前不合理的工业分布是会被逐步调整得合理化的。
    第五、经营管理的改善  中国轻工业无论公私营厂的经营管理，目前还停留在相当落后的阶段。公营厂方面，经过一年来的摸索，虽然已取得若干进步和成绩（东北因时间较久，已获得先进的经验），但在实行经济核算制和加强计划性上，还只能说刚在开始和学习阶段。私营工业自解放以来，多数企业在劳资关系，经营方式等方面，无疑地已有了一些改进，生产效率亦逐步提高，但亦有若干企业，依然保持着臃肿的机构，封建性的管理方法，投机依赖的习性，目光短视，不想或拒绝进行改造。这样的企业，就不能跟着时代进步，而有遭受淘汰的危险。
    在新民主主义社会的一切工业中，必须发挥劳动生产效能，以提高产量，改进质量，降低成本。这是促使工业向前发展的基本动力。对于轻工业来说，为了满足广大人民日益增长的需要，为了替国家积累建设的资金，这样的努力目标尤其重要。
    现在工农产品价格间的剪刀差距，还是相当大。工业品的成本太高，（这里也包括着若干工业品的利润太高的问题），农民买不起，因此也就必然使工业品市场束缚在狭窄的城市圈中。要把市场扩大，除了依靠农村实行土改、农村经济好转外，工业本身也必须努力；降低成本是其中重要的因素，但要达到降低成本的目的，不论公私企业，都必须在管理民主化的基础上，实行严格的经济核算制。只有把民主的经营管理作为中心环节，不断的改进，才能充分发挥工业中的潜在能力，使生产力迅速发展，同时积累资金，积聚经验，为轻工业未来的大规模发展创造必要的条件。
    第六、组织中小企业的联营合作  前面讲过，中国轻工业的特点之一是中小资本及小生产方式占极大的比重。为了把这些分散零星的中小工业生产组织起来减少它们的盲目性和脆弱性，联合经营是一个有效的方式。一年来各地工业联营的组织已普遍推行，并已在帮助工商业克服困难的过程中，取得相当的成绩。虽然在具体运用时，联营亦可能产生若干缺点和偏向，但一般的经验，联营在组织生产，加强计划性，稳定原料或产品的价格，节省人力物力的浪费，提高产品数量质量，降低成本，保证品质，划一规格，提高技术等方面，确能发挥其一定的作用，特别在引导私营经济与国营经济相结合，接受后者的领导，向国家资本主义道路发展一点上，联营可以起很大的媒介和组织作用。所以在轻工业的恢复和调整过程中，如何更广泛灵活的运用联营组织，来帮助中小企业克服困难，使它们从个别的小生产方式走向集体化的联合生产方式，是重大课题之一。
    第七、提高工业技术水准  中国轻工业的技术水准，一般说还相当落后，特别是偏处内地或战时发展起来的工业，设备简陋，技术幼稚，致产品滞销，不受消费者欢迎。沿海若干新式工厂技术虽较优越，部分产品并可出口外销（如棉织品、搪瓷、热水瓶、铝器、日用电器等），但质量规格亦缺乏统一的标准。由于轻工业的产品种类复杂，所以技术也是多方面的。中国过去并无专才培养，很多技术都是从实际经验中积聚而得。在恢复调整期间，我们应加强研究试验工作，将先进技术与工人的实际经验结合起来，展开经验交流，奖励创造发明，提倡合理化建议。在条件具备时，并应制订和实行统一的标准规格，加强质量的检验和检查工作，逐步统一全国同类产品的规格和质量标准，以改进和提高全国轻工业的技术水准。
    为了帮助轻工业摆脱对国外的依赖，如何在技术上找寻和发现外国原材料的替代品，并设法自制各种过去必须输入的制品，是技术人员重大的光荣任务。
    三、恢复调整的领导工作
    轻工业要实行以上的恢复调整工作，必须有坚强的领导。如何进行领导，我以为应该采取下列的方法：
    第一、具体深入的调查研究  毛主席说：“没有调查，没有发言权”。只有对工业情况和问题熟悉了解，并吸收各方面的意见和经验，经过周密的分析，才能制定切实正确的方针政策。但各地轻工业目前尚无密切的联系和完整的统计，为了达到了解情况，解决问题的目的，召开专业会议是有效的方法之一。各地区、各方面的代表把各种情况反映上来，把各种问题和意见提出来，经过民主的讨论和研究，决定政策办法，由代表们回去推动执行，这是从群众中来，到群众中去的正确路线。但为了把会议开好，会前必须进行充分的酝酿和准备，会后必须有力地贯彻执行。
    第二、建立必要的统计制度  没有统计数字，对工业生产中的情况就无从了解和核算，计划领导工作也就毫无根据。但是如何建立一个经常的健全的统计制度，在目前轻工业说来，还是一桩艰困的工作。由于私营工业和地方工业占据多数，由于过去的统计工作缺乏基础，我们暂时还不能采取整套繁复的近代化统计表报，而只能有重点、有步骤地先从主要工业的基本情况和简单的产销数字、原物料消耗数字做起。把这一基本的统计工作做好，是轻工业各级主管机关正确进行领导工作的前提条件。
    第三、促进工业生产的计划性  在轻工业的恢复调整过程中，如何促进工业生产的计划性，是领导工作中的一个重要课题。由于轻工业中大部分是私营工业，不可避免地将会遭受到许多阻碍和困难。周总理说：“私营经济的资本主义性质，与彻底的计划性是有矛盾的。但是在这里我们需要注意：第一、在一切最重要的经济部门，我们已经有了强大的社会主义性的国家经济，并已开始发展了半社会主义性的合作社经济。第二、私营经济是处在国家经济的各种形式领导之下，其中还包含着日益发展的、为社会主义经济服务的国家资本主义经济。因为这样，我们就有根据来说，可以使中国的经济一步一步地避免过去的无政府状态，而带有更大的计划性”。陈云主任也说：“调整产销关系是在经济改组中最繁难的一个问题。高度计划性的生产目前还不可能，但是在商业投机基本上受到控制之后，相对地、初步地有计划的生产，已经成为可能，产销平衡的现象，应该逐步可以实现”。根据以上的指示，我们一方面要认识到私营工业的本质，避免犯急性病或命令主义的偏向，同时更要加强国营经济的各种领导，耐心细致的引导轻工业走向计划生产。
    第四、调整公私关系与辅导私营企业  陈云主任说：“所谓调整公私工商业关系的实质，是一方面确立国家经济的领导地位，一方面要使私人资本主义经济在国家经济领导下面各得其所”。轻工业中调整公私关系的基本原则也是如此。在具体的运用方面，我们要鼓励私人经营的积极性，指导促进经营管理的改善、劳资关系的协调和技术的提高，适当地帮助他们解决困难。最后我们还要尽可能组织和引导他们与国营经济相结合，向国家资本主义的方向发展。
    四、为轻工业的恢复和发展而奋斗
    由于先天不足、后天失调，中国轻工业目前还存在着各种缺陷和困难，但它的发展前途是异常远大的。中国轻工业具有很多有利的客观条件：第一、中国有着四亿七千五百万人口的国内市场，土改完成后农业生产发展，农民购买力提高，对轻工业品的需要将不断增长，空前庞大；而在国外方面，多数地区的工业还相当落后，近年来我国已有相当数量的轻工业产品输出；今后只要我们努力争取，这部分市场还是可以保持并扩大的。第二、中国拥有丰富的轻工业原料资源，如棉花、羊毛、丝、麻、大豆、烟叶、植物纤维、油脂以及矿产、畜产、农产品，这些资源，今后只要努力开发培植，是取之不尽、用之不竭的。第三、中国轻工业已有数万单位的大小工厂，其中规模较大、具有近代设备的工厂不下千家；全国轻工业中热练的产业工人在百万人以上；生产技术方面亦已有相当的经验和成绩，这是很好的基础。在这样优越的客观条件和基础上，我们必须好好努力，于三五年内进行各种调整与恢复工作，以准备必要的条件，为中国轻工业未来大规模的建设和发展而奋斗。
