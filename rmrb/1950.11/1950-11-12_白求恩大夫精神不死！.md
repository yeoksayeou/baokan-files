　　The Spirit of Doctor Bethune is Immortal!
　　Second Rear Hospital of the North China Military Region, Wang Shuzhi
　　Eleven years ago today, this international friend, Dr. Bethune, who devoted his life to the cause of human liberation, demonstrated boundless enthusiasm for the Chinese revolution in the rural environment of the Jin-Cha-Ji Anti-Japanese Base Area, amidst cruel and frequent warfare.
　　In just one week, he examined five hundred and twenty-five sick and wounded soldiers. In four weeks of continuous surgery, he enabled one hundred and forty-seven wounded soldiers to return to the front lines with healthy bodies. He once said, "As long as the sick and wounded tell me they are well, I don't know how happy I can be." This fully demonstrates his care and love for the sick and wounded.
　　He was not afraid of danger in the enemy's artillery fire on the front lines. Under the conditions of material scarcity at the time, he overcame various difficulties in the tense day and night medical surgery, and trained and cultivated a large number of health workers to meet the needs of the war. He was busy all day, but he never felt tired.
　　He dedicated his life to serving the cause of the Chinese people's liberation, which is the noblest political quality of a communist that we should learn from. Chairman Mao said in "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "What kind of spirit is it that a foreigner, with no selfish motive, regards the cause of the Chinese people's liberation as his own? This is the spirit of internationalism, the spirit of communism. Every Chinese communist must learn this spirit from him."
　　We must learn from Comrade Bethune's spirit of overcoming difficulties and internationalism, learn from his positive and responsible work style and his love for the sick and wounded, and overcome the phenomenon of being careless and irresponsible. We must use this spirit of internationalism to support our fraternal neighbor, the Korean people, in resisting American aggression.

　　白求恩大夫精神不死！
    华北军区第二后方医院　王书志
    在十一年前的今天，这位以毕生精力献身于人类解放事业的国际友人——白求恩大夫，正在晋察冀抗日根据地的农村环境下，在残酷和频繁的战争中，表现了对中国革命事业的无限热忱。
    他仅仅在一周之内，就检查了五百二十五个伤病员。在四星期的连续手术中，使一百四十七个伤员，带着健康身体，重上前线。他曾经这样说过：“只要伤病员告诉我一声好，那我就不知道该怎样快乐了。”充分的显示着对伤病员的关心和热爱。
    他在最前线的敌人炮火中，不怕危险。在当时物资缺乏的条件下，在紧张的日夜医疗手术中，克服了种种困难，训练和培养了大批卫生工作人员，适应了战争需要。他终日忙碌，却丝毫不觉疲劳。
    他为中国人民解放事业服务，献出了自己的生命，这是值得我们学习的共产党员最高尚的政治品质。毛主席在《学习白求恩》一文中说：“一个外国人，毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业，当作他自己的事业，这是什么精神？这是国际主义的精神，这是共产主义的精神，中国共产党员每个同志都要学习他这种精神。”
    我们要学习白求恩同志的克服困难与国际主义精神，学习他积极负责及对伤病员热爱的工作作风，克服粗枝大叶不负责任的现象。我们要用这种国际主义的精神，支援我们的兄弟邻邦朝鲜人民的抵抗美国侵略。
