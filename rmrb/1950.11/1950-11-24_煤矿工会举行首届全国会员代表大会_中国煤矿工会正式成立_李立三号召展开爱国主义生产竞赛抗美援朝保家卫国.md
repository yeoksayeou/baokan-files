Xinhua News Agency report: The first National Congress of Members of the Chinese Coal Miners' Union, which opened in Beijing on the 15th of this month, successfully concluded on the 21st. The Chinese Coal Miners' Union was officially established at the same time. Zhao Yuxiang, Zhao Huanan, and 41 others were elected as members of the National Committee of the Chinese Coal Miners' Union; Liu Mingfu and 13 others were elected as alternate members; Jia Ke and 6 others were elected as members of the Finance Review Committee, with 3 alternate members of the Finance Review Committee.

At the opening of the congress, Vice Chairman Zhu De of the Central People's Government called on coal miners across the country to strive to improve output, quality, and reduce costs, further develop the coal mining industry, and fully supply the needs of all industries and the people. Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out in his speech that the current coal mining industry should take safe production and the gradual, conditional implementation of mechanized production as its direction of struggle. To this end, all employees must vigorously carry out cultural and technical studies. He called on coal miners across the country to launch a patriotic safety production competition, using practical actions to improve production, defend the country, support Korea, and resist the aggression of U.S. imperialism.

This meeting summarized the work of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Coal Miners' Union over the past nine months. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently 460,000 coal miners in the country, of which 64.5 percent have joined trade union organizations. In state-owned coal mines, the proportion of employees who have joined trade unions has reached 77 percent. In the past nine months, under the leadership of trade union organizations, coal mine workers have implemented the policy of democratic management. The foreman system, which used to control and oppress workers, has been basically abolished, and the unreasonable systems left over from imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism in the coal mining industry have also been initially eliminated. The safe production movement has also been launched, and the difficult living conditions and dangerous working conditions of coal miners have been improved at the same time. Coal mine employees, accounting for 17 percent of the total number of employees in the country, are enthusiastically engaged in cultural learning, creating the necessary conditions for further improving the safe production movement.

The meeting determined that the future tasks of the Coal Miners' Union are to carry out safe production, improve and consolidate grassroots trade union organizations, strengthen employees' spare-time cultural education, and more deeply implement democratic management under the general guideline of launching a patriotic production competition.

The meeting passed the following documents and circular telegrams: A letter to Chairman Mao; a call to coal miners across the country to launch a patriotic production competition to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, defend the homeland; telegrams to the Chinese Volunteer Army in Korea, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Second World Peace Congress, and the Miners' International, expressing the Chinese 450,000 coal miners' love of peace and determination to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea; and a telegram to the United Nations Security Council, accusing U.S. imperialism of aggression against Korea and our Taiwan, and of bombing our Northeast.

    会议确定煤矿工会今后的任务是在展开爱国主义生产竞赛的总方针下，进行安全生产，健全与巩固工会基层组织，加强职工业余文化教育，更深入地贯彻管理民主化。
