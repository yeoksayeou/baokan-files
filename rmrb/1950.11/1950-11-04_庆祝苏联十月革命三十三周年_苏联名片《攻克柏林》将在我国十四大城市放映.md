Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. To celebrate the 33rd anniversary of the Soviet Union's October Revolution, the Central Film Bureau has specifically selected the Soviet film masterpiece "The Fall of Berlin" to be released on the 7th. The film will be shown successively in fourteen major cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, Shenyang, Dalian, Harbin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Hankou, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Chongqing, and Dihua.

"The Fall of Berlin" is divided into two parts, written by Pavlenko, directed by Chiaureli, and composed by Shostakovich. The film won the Stalin Prize First Class for Literature and Art in 1949 and the "Crystal Globe," the highest prize at the 5th International Film Festival in 1950, for its outstanding political and artistic achievements. When the film premiered in Moscow, it attracted 150,000 viewers on the first day. Soviet public opinion considered the film's production a significant event in the lives of the Soviet people. The film has been dubbed into Mandarin Chinese by the Northeast Film Studio.

The film uses the experiences of a Soviet steelworker and a female teacher to comprehensively reflect the entire content of the Soviet anti-fascist Great Patriotic War: from the outbreak of the war and the brutal and frenzied attacks of the Hitler bandits to the great victory of the Soviet army at Stalingrad, all the way to the brilliant red flag of the Soviet army being planted on the Reichstag in Berlin.

"The Fall of Berlin" vividly depicts the happy life of the Soviet working people before the war and their strong patriotic will during the Great Patriotic War. It eloquently proves that a country where the working people are masters will never be conquered. "The Fall of Berlin" also proves the fate of all instigators of war: if they dare to invade the country of the working people, their own future will be destruction.

　　庆祝苏联十月革命三十三周年
    苏联名片《攻克柏林》将在我国十四大城市放映
    【新华社三日讯】中央电影局为庆祝苏联十月革命三十三周年纪念，特选定于七日上映苏联电影名片《攻克柏林》。该片将在北京、天津、济南、沈阳、大连、哈尔滨、上海、南京、杭州、汉口、广州、西安、重庆、迪化等十四大城市先后献映。
    《攻克柏林》分上下两集，由巴甫科编剧，齐阿乌列里导演，萧斯塔维奇作曲。该片因政治性和艺术性上的优异成就，曾获得一九四九年苏联斯大林文艺奖金一等奖及一九五○年第五届国际电影节的最优奖“水晶地球仪”。该片在莫斯科上演时，第一天观众即达十五万人。苏联舆论界认为该片的产生，是苏联人民生活中的重大事件。该片已由东北电影制片厂译制成华语对白拷贝。
    这部影片以一个苏联钢铁工人及一个女教师的经历，概括地反映了苏联反法西斯卫国战争的全部内容：从战争爆发，希特勒匪徒的残暴疯狂地进攻，到斯大林格勒苏军的大胜，一直到苏军的灿烂的红旗插上柏林的国会大厦。
    《攻克柏林》影片形象地描写苏联劳动人民战前的幸福生活和他们在卫国战争中坚强的爱国意志，它雄辩地证明：劳动人民做了主人的国家是绝不会被征服的。《攻克柏林》影片也证明了一切战争挑拨者的命运，如果他们敢于向劳动人民的国家进犯，那他们自己的前途就是灭亡。
