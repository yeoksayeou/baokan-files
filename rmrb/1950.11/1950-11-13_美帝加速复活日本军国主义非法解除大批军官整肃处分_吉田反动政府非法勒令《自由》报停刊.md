　　Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: MacArthur and his lackey, the reactionary Yoshida government, are accelerating the revival of Japanese militarism. After lifting the purge orders on over 10,000 Japanese reactionaries, they are now intensifying their efforts by lifting the purge orders on a large number of young, professional Japanese military officers, in order to openly use them as tools for the U.S.'s expanding war of aggression. According to a Kyodo News Agency Tokyo dispatch, the Yoshida government formally announced on the 10th that the purge orders would be lifted for all 3,250 individuals (1,761 from the army and 1,489 from the navy) who entered Japanese army and naval academies after December 8, 1941 (i.e., the date of the outbreak of the Pacific War) and served as officers before Japan's surrender, restoring their right to hold public office. This illegal measure to lift the purge orders was approved by MacArthur as early as October 30th. According to Kyodo News Agency, the Yoshida government hopes to implement a similar measure to lift the purge orders on professional military officers who entered army and naval academies before December 8, 1941.

　　At the same time, MacArthur is continuing to illegally "parole" Japanese war criminals. According to a Kyodo News Agency dispatch, MacArthur Headquarters' legal department announced on the 10th that it had approved the "parole" of six war criminals. They will be released on the 22nd. So far, MacArthur has illegally "paroled" 22 groups of war criminals, totaling 133 individuals.

　　Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: The reactionary Yoshida government in Japan continues to illegally shut down progressive newspapers. According to a Kyodo News Agency Tokyo dispatch, the "Freedom" newspaper, which was launched on October 4th of this year, was ordered to permanently cease publication on the 10th by the Special Examination Bureau of the Ministry of Justice. At the same time, the Yoshida government illegally searched the newspaper's publishing house and printing plant, unreasonably seized printing equipment, and confiscated remaining newspapers and documents.

　　According to a United Press report, the Yoshida government searched ten progressive publishing houses in Tokyo on October 28th and ordered the cessation of publication of their publications.

    吉田反动政府非法勒令《自由》报停刊
    【新华社十一日讯】正在加速复活日本军国主义的麦克阿瑟及其走狗吉田反动政府，在对一万多名日本反动分子解除整肃之后，竟变本加厉，又解除对大批日本少壮职业军官的整肃处分，以便公开利用他们充当美国扩大侵略战争的工具。据共同社东京讯：吉田政府十日正式宣布：一九四一年十二月八日（按即太平洋战争爆发日）以后进入日本各海、陆军学校受训，而在日本投降前担任军官的三千二百五十人（陆军方面一千七百六十一人，海军方面一千四百八十九人），一律解除整肃，恢复担任公职的权利。这次解除整肃的非法措施，早在十月三十日就得到麦克阿瑟的批准。据共同社透露，吉田政府希望对一九四一年十二月八日以前进陆、海军学校的职业军官，也来一次解除整肃的措施。
    同时，麦克阿瑟并在继续非法“假释”日本战犯。据共同社讯：麦克阿瑟总部法律组十日宣布批准“假释”战犯六名。他们将在二十二日出狱。到目前为止，被麦克阿瑟非法“假释”的战犯先后已有二十二批，共一百三十三名。
    【新华社十一日讯】日本吉田反动政府继续非法封闭进步报纸。据共同社东京讯：今年十月四日创刊的《自由》报，于十日被法务府特别审查局勒令永久停刊。同时，吉田政府并非法搜查该报发行所及印刷所，无理查封印刷设备，并没收存余报纸和文件等。
    另据合众社讯，吉田政府曾于十月二十八日搜查东京的十家进步出版社，并勒令它们出版的刊物停止出版。
