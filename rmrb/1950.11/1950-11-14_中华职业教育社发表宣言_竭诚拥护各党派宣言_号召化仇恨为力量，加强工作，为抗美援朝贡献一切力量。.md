　　China Vocational Education Society Issues Declaration
　　Earnestly Support Declarations of All Parties
    Call to Transform Hatred into Strength, Strengthen Work, and Contribute All Strength to Resist America and Aid Korea.
    [Report from this newspaper] The crimes of American imperialism in shamelessly invading Korea and seriously threatening our country's security have aroused the indignation of the people throughout the country. The China Vocational Education Society has issued a declaration to protest against American imperialist aggression and to aid Korea. The declaration states:

    The hideous face of American imperialism is now fully exposed. On the one hand, it is invading our Taiwan and constantly and illegally infringing upon our country's territorial waters and airspace with its navy and air force. On the other hand, it is expanding the war of aggression in Korea, frantically crossing the "38th parallel," and extending the flames of war to our country's borders. It vainly attempts to copy the Japanese imperialists' continental policy, annex Korea, invade our Northeast, and then dominate Asia and conquer the world. But its ambitions are even greater and more ruthless than those of Japan, and its actions are even more sinister. It vainly attempts to rapidly encircle and attack our People's Republic of China from the three strongholds of Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Our people across the country not only closely watch and hate this aggressive act of American imperialism that threatens our country's security, but also act without hesitation to fight to the end with the same determination and courage as we defeated Japanese imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and defeat American imperialism and all aggressions by any imperialists!

    In addition to sincerely supporting the joint declaration of the democratic parties and sincerely supporting Premier Zhou's righteous and stern declaration that "the Chinese people will never tolerate foreign aggression, nor will they allow the imperialists to肆行invade their neighbors and ignore them," we also call on all members, alumni, staff, teachers and students of affiliated schools at all levels, and people from all walks of life who have had relationships with the affiliated undertakings of the association, to transform hatred into strength, strengthen work, strengthen unity, contribute all our strength, stand with the people of the whole country, and fight to resist America and aid Korea. We firmly believe that final victory will surely belong to the righteous people and to the side of the world peace and democracy camp.

　　中华职业教育社发表宣言
　　竭诚拥护各党派宣言
    号召化仇恨为力量，加强工作，为抗美援朝贡献一切力量。
    【本报讯】美帝无耻侵犯朝鲜并严重威胁我国安全的罪行激起了全国人民的愤恨，中华职业教育社对此特发表宣言，抗议美帝侵略、援助朝鲜。宣言称：
    美帝国主义的狰狞面目，现已完全暴露出来。它一面侵略我们的台湾，并以海军空军不断非法地侵扰我国的领海领空，一面扩大朝鲜的侵略战争，疯狂地越过“三八线”，把战火延烧到我国的边境。它妄想抄袭日本帝国主义的大陆政策，兼并朝鲜，侵略我们的东北，进而统治亚洲，征服全世界。但它的野心比日本更大更狠，行动也更毒辣，它妄想从朝鲜、台湾、越南三个据点迅速地包围并进攻我中华人民共和国。我们全国人民不仅密切注视、仇视着美帝这一威胁我国安全的侵略行为，而且毫不迟疑地行动起来，以击败日本帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮那样的坚决和英勇斗争到底，打败美帝国主义以及任何帝国主义者的一切侵略！
    中华职业教育社除了竭诚地拥护各民主党派的联合宣言，竭诚拥护周总理“中国人民决不能容忍外国的侵略，也不能听任帝国主义者对自己的邻人肆行侵略而置之不理”义正词严的宣示外，我们并号召全体社员、校友、工作人员、附属各级学校的教师和学生，曾经和本社附属事业发生过关系的社会人士，把仇恨化作力量，加强工作，加强团结，贡献出我们一切的力量，和全国人民站在一起，为抗美援朝而斗争，我们深信最后胜利一定是属于正义的人民的，是属于世界和平民主阵营这一边的。
