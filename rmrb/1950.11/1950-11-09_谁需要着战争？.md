Who Needs War?

    *Soviet Literature Gazette*

    The August 21, 1950, issue of the American magazine *Newsweek* featured a large photograph on its cover: a doctor performing surgery on a young, seriously wounded American soldier. The magazine captioned it as "just one of the thousands of American soldiers wounded in Korea."

    Why would this ordinary "G.I." – a common term for American soldiers – receive such attention from a reactionary magazine close to commercial groups? Because today, Wall Street brokers are completing massive enterprises with the blood of people of all nations. This young man's blood, combined with the blood of other wounded or killed American soldiers and Korean patriots, is being converted into gold flowing into the pockets of Wall Street industrialists...

    Not long ago, Vyshinsky, the head of the Soviet delegation to the United Nations, exposed the real reasons for the war in Korea in a speech to the UN General Assembly. He cited numerous American newspapers to prove that American imperialists were making considerable profits from the Korean War.

    *Newsweek* quite frankly wrote about this fact. The magazine's economic observer reported, "Clearly, a new mobilization of industry is heading towards a prolonged period of bloody fighting." The stocks of various companies working for the war have risen. "Since the shooting started, the oil company index has increased by several points." "Railways are also profiting from the escalation of military activity," the observer continued. "The aviation industry" is also a prosperous industry. The stock prices of several companies, such as Grumman, Bell, and "United Aircraft Corporation" (a company closely related to former Secretary of Defense Johnson), are approaching the best index of 1950.

    How could the American aviation industry not prosper? The products of the aviation industry are in such demand: Truman's air pirates have been barbarously destroying Korean cities and villages and massacring peaceful residents for more than three months!

    Next, it mentioned that some capital groups, such as electrical industry, chemical industry, and auto parts manufacturing companies, were also doing well.

    *Newsweek* contained a reprinted chart. This chart was based on materials from the Wall Street statistical agency "Dow Jones." The chart was titled "Wall Street is Reading the Headlines." Along the rapidly rising curve were arranged a series of front pages from *The New York Herald Tribune* describing America's intervention in Korea. While one newspaper reported new sacrifices on the Korean front, the "industrial activity" curve was rising.

    War brings huge profits to monopoly capitalists. Only one thing makes them uneasy: how to prevent the military operations in Korea from ending. Wall Street's deacons, such as Bradley, Harriman, Secretary of Commerce Sawyer, and others, are already clamoring that the prospect of ending the war in Korea "creates danger" for the American armament plan. Therefore, the flames of war should not be extinguished at any cost...

    The people of all nations in the world do not want to go to slaughter for Wall Street's profits and must settle accounts with the crimes of American imperialism. They will also remember this small chart!

　　谁需要着战争？
    苏联文学报
    一九五○年八月二十一日出版的美国《新闻周刊》的封面上，刊有一张这样的大照片：医生正在给一个受了重伤的年青美国兵施行手术。该杂志加以注解说，这“只是在朝鲜受了伤的成千的美国士兵之一”。
    为什么这个普通的“Ｇ·Ｉ·”——一种惯常的对美国兵士的称呼——会这样获得了这一个接近商业集团的反动杂志的重视呢？因为今天华尔街的经纪人正在用各族人民的血来完成庞大的企业。这个小伙子的血，与其他受伤或阵亡的美国兵士的血以及朝鲜爱国志士的血汇合在一起，变成了金元流到华尔街实业家的口袋里去……
    不久以前，联合国苏联代表团团长维辛斯基，在联合国大会上演说时曾把朝鲜发生战事的真正原因揭露出来。他引了许多美国报刊的话，证明美帝国主义者从朝鲜战事获得了不少的利润。
    《新闻周刊》十分坦白地写出了这一事实。该杂志的经济观察家报道说：“显然，工业的新动员正在走向多血战斗的持久时期”。为战争而工作的各种企业的股票都涨了价。“从射击开始后，石油公司的指数提高了几点”。“铁路也因军事的加剧而获利”，观察家继续写道：“航空工业”也是繁荣的实业。如哥鲁曼，贝尔，“联合飞机制造厂”（这个公司与前国防部长詹逊有密切的关系）等几家公司的股票价格，接近于一九五○年最良好的指数。
    美国的航空工业怎么能不繁荣呢？航空工业的产品是有如此的需要的：杜鲁门的空中强盗野蛮地破坏朝鲜的城市与农村并杀戮和平居民，已经三多个月了！
    接着谈到的是有些资本集团，如电器工业，化学工业和汽车零件制造业等公司，情况也不坏。
    《新闻周刊》上，载有翻印在这里的一张图表。这张图表是根据华尔街统计机关“多琼斯”的材料制成的。这个图表上标着这样的题目：“华尔街正在读标题”。沿着急遽上升的曲线两侧，配搭着《纽约先驱论坛报》上一连串描述美国在朝干涉行动的第一版。一面报纸上报道着朝鲜战线上新而又新的牺牲，一面“实业的活动”曲线上升着。
    战争给独占资本家们带来巨大的利润。使他们不安的只有一件事：怎样使朝鲜的军事行动不要结束。华尔街的执事们，如布莱德雷、哈里曼、商务部长沙逊及其他已经在叫嚣说：在朝鲜结束战争的远景，给美国武装计划“创造着危险”。因此，战火无论如何不应熄灭……
    世界上各族人民不愿为华尔街的利润走向屠杀，都要清算美帝国主义的罪恶。他们也会记住这个小小的图表！
