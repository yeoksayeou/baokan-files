　　What I Saw in America
    He Ziquan, Professor of History Department, Normal University

    Chairman Mao said that American imperialism is a paper tiger. This is the most accurate understanding of American imperialism. If you see the relationship between the American government and the American people, you will understand the correctness of this statement even more.

    Because of its abundant resources, highly developed capitalist system, and exploitation of colonies around the world, the lives of the general working people in the United States are still relatively comfortable. But as a result, most people pay no attention to political issues, and their political awareness is very low. What they care about is how to make money, how to find a girlfriend, how to buy a car, and everything else is just water off a duck's back. Even the quadrennial presidential election rarely sees more than half of the eligible voters participating. During elections, American politicians take advantage of the American people's inattention to political issues to control the American regime, but this is gradually becoming a thing of the past. Globally speaking, the capitalist system has reached its death throes. Although American capitalism has not decayed to the same extent as European capitalism, it has already embarked on a downward spiral, hindering the development of productive forces. In recent years, the severity of the unemployment problem, as well as the vigorous development of world democratic forces due to the overall decline of capitalism, have forced American imperialism to personally deal with its crisis. The general public has gradually awakened, realizing that if they continue to allow those politicians to control the regime, they will be led to their deaths. They are gradually moving from not paying attention to political issues to paying attention to them.

    I left New York on August 6th, more than a month after the outbreak of the Korean War. In New York, you could see the rising anti-war sentiment of the people everywhere. Among the young people in New York who were drafted into the army, 10 to 20 percent failed to show up for their physical examinations every day. It is said that the Department of Defense sent letters to more than a thousand medical personnel who had served in the Far East during World War II, hoping that they would serve in the army invading Korea, but the vast majority of medical personnel did not even reply, simply ignoring them. One person replied, saying that he only knew one Korean phrase, but he had forgotten it now, and his wife didn't want him to go either, so he couldn't go.

    There are more than ten million Black people in the United States, and they live in extreme poverty. Almost all the work that white people consider to be inferior is done by Black people. In the southern states, streetcars and buses are divided into front and rear seats, and Black people are not allowed to sit in white people's seats. If they violate the rules, they will be severely beaten. They are also not equal before their God. When entering and leaving churches, white people have white people's doors, and Black people have Black people's doors. Even before the law, they are actually unequal. If a white person insults a Black person, the court will let them off lightly. If a Black person insults a white person, they will receive a severe sentence. Black people harbor deep hatred for the American government. When I was in New York, a progressive American friend told me that one of his Black friends had been sent to prison by the government. He discussed rescuing him with the friend's family, but the family said: Why bother to rescue him! The prison doors will be opened by the people one day.

    The current American government is built on such a foundation of the people's growing awakening, resistance, and hatred. But all these situations are difficult to see in the newspapers or hear on the radio. Except for a very few progressive newspapers, the vast majority of newspapers and radio stations are controlled by Wall Street capitalists. The shamelessness of the American newspapers that use "democracy and freedom" to deceive people is unimaginable. For example, every year on May Day, the working masses and progressives in New York hold a grand parade on Eighth Avenue. In order to disrupt the parade, the government and veterans' associations also hold a parade on Fifth Avenue, using beautiful women's legs to attract the audience. Last year on May Day, I went to see both sides. The crowds on Eighth Avenue were so dense that the procession continued from morning to six or seven in the afternoon. Although the parade on Fifth Avenue was beautifully decorated, there were very few people. By two o'clock in the afternoon, you couldn't even see the shadow of a person in the parade. But when you open the New York newspapers the next day, they all say that Fifth Avenue was crowded and lively all day, and Eighth Avenue had no one, and it was over in a moment. How can you imagine that these newspapers, which constantly talk about "democracy and freedom," are so vile and shameless!

    The United States has its democratic traditions. These democratic traditions are now being inherited by the American Communist Party and some progressive groups. However, these democratic traditions are now being subjected to unparalleled persecution by the American government. But, if you can deeply understand the relationship between the American government and the people, and clearly see the trend of the American people's growing awakening, you can understand that this intensified persecution reflects the growth of the American people's democratic forces and the internal crisis of American imperialism. American imperialism is a paper tiger that is strong on the outside but weak on the inside. It is facing not only a powerful camp of peace and democracy abroad, but also an internal anti-imperialist force of the people that is gradually awakening and growing stronger.

　　我所看到的美国
    师范大学历史系教授何兹全
    毛主席说美帝国主义是一只纸老虎。这是对美帝的一个最真切的认识。你如果看到美国政府和美国人民的关系，你就更会明白这话的正确。
    美国因为资源厚与资本主义制度高度发达和对世界各殖民地的剥削，一般在业的人民的生活，还过得去。但也就因此，一般人对于政治问题，毫不注意，政治水平非常低。他们所注意的，是如何找钱，如何找女朋友，如何买汽车，此外的事，对他们都是耳边风。就连最热闹的四年一度的总统选举也很少有超过选民半数以上的人出来参加。选举的时候，美国的一般政客，就利用美国人民不注意政治问题，才能把持美国的政权，但这也渐渐成为过去的事了。就整个世界说，资本主义制度已到了死亡期，美国资本主义虽然没有腐朽到像欧洲资本主义那样的程度，但也早走上了下坡路，阻碍着生产力的发展。近年来失业问题的严重，以及因整个资本主义的没落，世界民主势力的蓬勃发展，美帝不能不亲自出来应付他们的危急局面。一般人民已渐渐觉醒，知道再这样让那些政客们把政权把持下去，将把他们带向死亡。他们由不注意政治问题，渐渐走到注意政治问题了。
    我是八月六日离开纽约的，那时朝鲜战争已经爆发了一个多月。在纽约你随处可以看见人民反战情绪的高涨。纽约应征入伍的青年，在检查体格时，每天总有百分之十到二十的人不到。据说国防部曾向一千多曾于第二次世界大战时在远东服役的医务人员发信，望他们到侵朝的军队中服务，但绝大多数的医务人员连信都没有回，根本不理。有一个回信了，说他只会一句朝鲜话，现在也忘了，而且他的太太也不叫他去，所以他不能去。
    美国有一千多万黑人，他们都过着极穷苦的生活，差不多所有的在白人认为低下的工作，都是黑人去作。在南方几州，街车汽车都分前后座，黑人不能坐白人的座位，犯了规矩拉下来就是一顿苦打。在他们的上帝面前，也不平等，进出教堂，白人有白人的门，黑人有黑人的门。就在法律面前，实际上也是不平等的。白人污辱了黑人，法院就轻轻放过，黑人污辱了白人，一来就是重刑。黑人对于美国政府，蕴藏着极深的仇恨。我在纽约时，一位进步的美国朋友告诉我，他有一个黑人朋友被政府送到监狱里，他和那位朋友的家属商量营救，他的家属说：何必去营救呢！监狱的门总有一天是要被人民打开的。
    目下的美国政府，就是建立在这样一个人民日渐觉醒、反抗、仇视的基础上。但所有这些情形，是很难从报纸上看到，或从广播上听到的。除了极少数的进步报纸之外，绝大多数的报纸和广播都操在华尔街资本家手里。以《民主自由》骗人的美帝的报纸的无耻，是很难想像的。例如：每年五一劳动节，纽约的工人群众和进步人士在八马路上作盛大的游行。政府和退伍军人会，为了捣乱，也在五马路举行游行，以美女大腿来吸引观众。去年五一节，我两边都去看了。八马路人山人海的群众的队伍络绎不绝的一直从上午过到下午六、七时。五马路的游行虽然装饰很漂亮，但人数很少，一到下午两点多钟，连游行的人的影子都看不到了。但你打开第二天的纽约报纸时，却都说五马路人山人海热闹了一天，八马路没有人，而且一会就完了。你怎能想到这些一天到晚口口声声说“民主自由”的报纸，是如此的下贱无耻！
    美国是有他的民主传统的，这民主传统现在正为美国共产党及一些进步团体所继承，但这民主传统，现在却正受着美帝政府无比的迫害。但是，如果你能深入的去理解了美帝政府与人民的关系，看清楚美国人民的日渐觉醒的趋势，你就能理解，这种迫害的加强，正反映美国人民民主力量的增长，及美帝内部的危机，美帝是外强中干的一个纸老虎，他所面对着的，不仅是国外的一个强大的和平民主阵营，而且还有一个内部的日渐觉醒而壮大起来的人民反帝力量。
