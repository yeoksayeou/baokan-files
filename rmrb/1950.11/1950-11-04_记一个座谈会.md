　　A Record of a Symposium
    Zhang Xiyao
    On October 9th, the People's Iron Army Newspaper Agency held a symposium and invited representatives of the Railway Corps attending the National Model Worker Conference to talk about their feelings.

    The bright electric lights illuminated the medals on the chests of the representatives. They all excitedly talked about their first meeting with Chairman Mao. Wang Zhilin, a young Communist Party member, labor model representative of the Second Division, and hero of the repair of the Yuehan Railway, said: "As soon as Chairman Mao entered the venue, he first cast his eyes on the working people wearing multi-colored clothes, smiling and talking to everyone kindly. At that time, my heart was jumping with excitement."

    Li Wenzhu, a labor model representative of the Third Division, followed closely, saying: "After the liberation of Northeast China, I saw a portrait of Chairman Mao and learned to sing the song 'Chairman Mao, like the sun...' I thought to myself: when will I be able to see Chairman Mao? This time, my wish really came true. The night I met Chairman Mao, I was so happy that I couldn't sleep."

    Yang Lian-di, a height-climbing hero from the First Division, said: "When I was about to come, my comrades in the troops asked me to say hello to Chairman Mao on their behalf when I saw him, so I expressed this meaning to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao shook my hand tightly and said: 'Thank you for your kindness!'"

    The comrades all felt that it was such an honor for a worker, peasant, or soldier to meet, shake hands, and have a heartfelt conversation with their leader!

    At the meeting, the labor model representatives also recalled the scene when Soviet friends toasted them.

    Wang Zhilin's face was filled with a smile as he waved his hand and said: "The socialist country of the Soviet Union is so good to the Chinese people, they help us in everything. We must thank Comrade Stalin!"

    When the labor models talked about the American imperialist aggression against Korea and the repeated incursions of American planes into our Northeast airspace, they all gnashed their teeth and expressed their infinite resentment, unanimously expressing their determination to step up construction, strengthen the national defense forces, defend lasting world peace, and defend the motherland!

　　记一个座谈会
    张希尧
    十月九日，人民铁军报社召开了一个座谈会，请铁道兵团出席全国劳模会议的代表谈谈自己的感想。
    明亮的电灯光，照耀着代表们胸前的奖章。他们都兴奋地讲起他们第一次会见毛主席的情景。二师劳模代表、抢修粤汉路英雄、年青的共产党员王志林同志说：“毛主席一进会场，就首先把眼光投到穿着杂色衣服的劳动人民身上，微笑着，亲切地和大家说话。当时，我的心里兴奋得蹦蹦直跳。”
    三师劳模代表李文柱同志紧接着说：“东北解放后，我看见了毛主席的像片，又学会了唱“毛主席，像太阳……，”这只歌。我心里想：什么时候我也能看见毛主席呢。这回可真的实现了我的愿望了。我见了毛主席的那天晚上高兴得连觉也睡不着了。”
    一师登高英雄杨连第同志说：“我临来的时候，部队同志们叫我见到毛主席时代他们问好，我便把这意思向毛主席表示了。毛主席紧紧握着我的手说：‘谢谢你们的好意！’”
    同志们共同感到，一个工人、农民、士兵，能和自己的领袖会晤、握手、畅谈，这是多么光荣的事！
    会上，劳模代表们又回忆了苏联朋友给他们敬酒时的情形。
    王志林同志的脸上带着笑容，挥动着手说：“社会主义国家苏联对咱们中国人民实在太好了，他们事事都帮着咱们。我们要感谢斯大林同志！”
    当着劳模们谈起美帝国主义侵略朝鲜，及美机屡次进犯我东北领空时，都咬牙切齿地表示了无限的愤恨，一致表示决心加紧建设，壮大国防军，捍卫世界持久和平，保卫祖国！
