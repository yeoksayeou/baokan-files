　　Japan Under US Imperialist Rule
    People's Lives Increasingly Miserable
    Human Trafficking Incidents Significantly Increase Recently; All Residents of Tokyo to be Forced to Provide Fingerprints
    [Xinhua News Agency Dispatch] According to the Tokyo "Women's Democratic News," human trafficking incidents in Japan have significantly increased recently. The terms of servitude are extremely cruel. According to many cases of human trafficking released by the Kanagawa Prefecture Office of the Women and Minors Bureau of the Ministry of Labor, one case involves Kobayashi Yu, a widow from Ashizawa, Fukuhara Village, Kitamurayama County, Yamagata Prefecture. Driven by poverty, she first sold her two sons to Kanagawa Prefecture through human traffickers. The terms for selling her fourteen-year-old second son, Kobayashi Saburo, were: an advance payment of 1,000 yen, after which he would work for the buyer without compensation for life. Although Kobayashi Yu painfully sold her two children, she was still unable to make a living due to the decline of the rural economy. So, she sold herself indefinitely to Suda Sue, the owner of a bathhouse in Oiso Town, Kanagawa Prefecture.
    According to an investigation by the Fukushima branch of the Women and Minors Bureau, from the beginning of this year to the end of July alone, twenty-one victims of human trafficking cases were uncovered. Most of the women who were sold were forced into prostitution.
    [Xinhua News Agency Dispatch] TASS Shanghai, 14th: Tokyo dispatch: The Tokyo Police Department has decided to take fingerprints of Tokyo's seven million residents early next year. All residents of the city, including elementary school students, will be fingerprinted.

　　美帝统治下的日本
    人民生活日益痛苦
    贩卖人口事件最近显著增加东京全市居民将被迫打手印
    【新华社讯】据东京《妇女民主新闻》消息：日本贩卖人口的事件最近显著地增加。卖身的条件，极其残酷。据劳工省妇女少年局神奈川县办公处所发表的许多贩卖人口案件中，有一件是山形县北村山郡福原村芦泽地方的寡妇小林酉。她为生活所迫，通过人口贩子，先将两个儿子卖到神奈川县。她的十四岁的次子小林三郎的出卖条件是：预付一千日元，以后即终身无偿地为买主工作。小林酉虽然忍痛出卖了两个孩子，但因农村凋敝，依然无法生活。于是又将自己无限期地卖给神奈川县大矶町的浴室老板须田末。
    另据妇女少年局福岛办事处的调查，自今年年初到七月底为止，仅被揭发出来的贩卖人口案，就有受害人二十一名，被出卖的女子，大部都被迫为娼。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社上海十四日电：东京讯：东京警察局决定在明年初要东京的七百万居民打手印。全市居民都将打手印，甚至包括初级小学的学生。
