Xinhua News Agency Report: The work of collecting the autumn agricultural tax for 1950 throughout the country is progressing very rapidly with the enthusiastic payment of farmers.

The autumn tax collection in the major administrative regions of Southwest, Central South, East China, North China, Northwest, and Northeast began in the second half of October or early November, and has now entered the stage of full grain delivery to warehouses. Among them, farmers in various parts of northern Sichuan had basically completed the payment of public grain as early as late October. It is expected that all regions in the Southwest, many provinces in the Central South region such as Hunan and Hubei, and most parts of East China and North China can be completed by the end of November.

The major administrative regions, the people's governments of various provinces, and the leading organs of the Communist Party in various regions have all paid attention to deeply mobilizing the peasant masses and implementing the Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax promulgated by the Central People's Government in this year's autumn tax collection work. Before the start of the tax collection, they all convened meetings of cadres at all levels, people's representative conferences of all sectors, and peasant representative conferences to fairly and reasonably allocate tasks. All staff participating in the collection studied relevant policy documents on agricultural tax. In northern Sichuan, more than 15,000 cadres were trained and sent to various villages. Among the 12,000 cadres participating in tax assistance in northern Jiangsu, more than one-third went to the countryside only after passing policy tests and internships.

After various social reforms, the class consciousness and patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants in various regions have been increasing day by day. This year's bumper harvest and the burden are fairer and more reasonable than last year. More importantly, farmers love the People's Government and the motherland. In order to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and enrich national strength, farmers are more enthusiastic in paying agricultural tax. In eastern Sichuan, from October 15th to 28th, more than 380 million catties of public grain were put into storage in thirteen days. Among them, eight counties including Tongliang, Changshou, and Jiangbei have all paid off. The public grain in this area can be completed in mid-November. About ten days after the start of tax collection in Hunan Province, more than 300 million catties of public grain had been put into storage in four special districts including Changsha, Changde, Shaoyang, and Lingling (incomplete statistics). Except for Fujian, where the tax collection started later, the other six provinces in East China have all started full tax collection. Farmers in Pujiang, Zhejiang Province, and other places had prepared the public grain to be paid in advance by airing, drying, and loading it into bamboo baskets. As soon as the notice arrived, they helped each other deliver the grain, which made the county's public grain enter the warehouse quickly. Farmers in Lüzhu Village, Xindeng County, paid off all 37,200 catties of public grain in eight hours. Grandma Fang from Gaozhuang Village, Shuyang, northern Jiangsu, which has been hit by floods for many years, ran more than twenty miles to rush to deliver public grain. She happily said, "If the People's Government hadn't dredged the Yi River, we would have been flooded and had nothing to eat and wear. This year, the flood damage has been reduced, and we have harvested grain. How can we not like paying public grain?" This year, the public grain burden in Xinjiang Province is only 57% of that before liberation. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang voluntarily handed over 20,000 piculs of grain produced, further reducing the burden on the people. Farmers of all ethnic groups in the province deeply felt the warmth of the People's Government and the People's Army, and asked to pay more public grain. Farmers in Henan Village, Gand County, voluntarily paid 25 piculs of grain. The People's Government only collected 6 piculs and 9 dou and 2 sheng according to the policy. Farmers in the Northeast on the front line of national defense, under the slogan of "Prepare the best grain and pay it to the country to defend the motherland," paid public grain quickly and well. After hearing that American imperialism was launching a new invasion against our country, farmers in North China and Central South launched a movement to pay public grain early.

While enthusiastically paying public grain, farmers in various regions have generally struggled against unscrupulous landlords who attempted to shift the burden and conceal farmland. Farmers in Neijiang County, southern Sichuan, found 200,000 dan of hidden fields, an increase of 25% over the reported farmland, thereby achieving a fair and reasonable burden.

　　充实国力抗美援朝
    各地农民踊跃缴纳公粮
    西南、中南、华东、华北等地月底可全部完成
    【新华社讯】全国各地征收一九五○年度秋季公粮的工作，在农民踊跃缴纳下进展甚为迅速。
    西南、中南、华东、华北、西北、东北各大行政区，今年秋征分别于十月下半月或十一月初开征，现已先后进入全面送粮入库的阶段。其中川北各地农民，早在十月下旬即已基本上完成公粮缴纳。西南各地，中南区湖南、湖北等许多省份，和华东、华北大部地区，预计十一月底均可全部完成。
    各大行政区和各省人民政府，各地共产党的领导机关，在今年秋征工作中，都曾注意深入发动农民群众和贯彻执行中央人民政府颁布的农业税暂行条例。开征前都曾普遍召开各级干部会、各界人民代表会议和农民代表会议，公平合理地分配了任务。各地参加征收的工作人员，一律都学习了有关农业税的政策文件。川北各县即有一万五千多干部经过训练分赴各村。苏北参加助征的一万二千干部中，三分之一以上是经过政策测验和实习后才下乡的。
    各地广大农民经过各项社会改革，阶级觉悟和爱国热忱日益提高，今秋丰收和负担比去年更趋公平合理；而更重要的是农民热爱人民政府和热爱祖国，为了抗美援朝，充实国力，农民缴纳公粮更加踊跃。川东区自十月十五日到二十八日十三天中，入库公粮已达三亿八千多万斤，其中铜梁、长寿、江北等八县已全部缴清。该区公粮于十一月中旬即可全部完成。湖南省开征后十天左右，长沙、常德、邵阳、零陵等四个专区（不完全统计），入库公粮就已达三亿多万斤。华东区除福建开征较迟外，其余六省均已全面开征。浙江省浦江等地农民事先就把应缴的公粮过风、晒干、装进箩筐准备好了，通知一到就互助送粮，使该县公粮入仓很快。新登县渌诸下村农民，八个钟头内就缴清了所有三万七千二百多斤公粮。苏北连年遭水灾的沭阳高庄村方老奶奶，跑了二十多里路抢送公粮，她高兴地说：“要不是人民政府把沂河扒通了，还得水淹，还得没吃没穿，今年减少了水患，收了粮食，缴公粮怎能不喜欢。”新疆省今年公粮负担仅为解放前的百分之五十七。驻新人民解放军又自动交出生产粮二万石，使人民的负担更见减轻。该省各族农民深深体会到人民政府、人民军队的温暖，纷纷要求多交公粮。干德县河南村农民自动缴粮二十五石，人民政府按政策只收了六石九斗二升。国防前线的东北农民，在“准备最好的粮食，缴给国家，保卫祖国”的口号下，交公粮又快又好。华北、中南各地农民在听到美帝国主义正在向我国发起新的侵略以后，都掀起了早交公粮的运动。
    与踊跃缴纳公粮的同时，各地农民普遍向企图转嫁负担、隐瞒田亩的不法地主，进行了斗争。川南内江县农民查出黑田二十万担，较所报田亩增加百分之二十五，从而作到了负担公平合理。
