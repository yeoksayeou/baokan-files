　　Remembering the Korean Volunteer Army
　　Liu Qifang
    I remember, eight or nine years ago in a cold winter, the Japanese devils stationed in Guoxian County, Shanxi Province, often set out from the city and Yangmingbao, inhumanly killing, burning, and looting. The common people were threatened by death every day, just like the Korean people under American imperialist aggression today. I was only eleven or twelve years old at the time, a member of the village's children's corps.
    One afternoon, suddenly more than 30 Korean Volunteer Army soldiers came to my village - Xiachangle Village, and stayed overnight in Liugou Street. They were particularly concerned about the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan, writing slogans everywhere, distributing leaflets; in the evening, they also convened mass rallies, gave speeches to the masses, and used the form of storytelling to publicize the truth of resisting Japan and saving the country. The disasters suffered by the Chinese people, they regarded as if they had suffered them themselves!
    Two days later, we heard that this Korean Volunteer Army had won a victory on the east bank of the Hutuo River between Chichi Village and Dongsongzhang Village, annihilating fourteen or fifteen Japanese devils, and seizing many "Sanba" rifles and box cannons. In this battle, a Korean comrade was wounded! They were resolute and brave in battle, willing to sacrifice their lives and blood for the survival and freedom of the Chinese people. They went through life and death with the Chinese people, tasted all kinds of hardships, and finally eliminated Japanese imperialism and won victory.
    Today, the warmongers Truman, MacArthur and that gang of fascists are carrying out a frenzied war of aggression against our Chinese neighbors, the Korean people, who are suffering the burning, killing and inhuman bombing by enemies even more barbaric and brutal than the Japanese devils. The Korean people are on the edge of a struggle between life and death, freedom and slavery.
    Now, the flames of American imperialist aggression against Korea have already burned to our country's doorstep, seriously threatening our country's peace and security, and killing and injuring our compatriots with airplanes. We cannot tolerate these aggressive crimes of American imperialism, we must put out the fire!
    The Chinese and Korean peoples have always been brothers who share life and death and go through thick and thin together. Yesterday, the Korean people shed blood for the cause of liberation of the Chinese people. Today, the Chinese people will, like the Korean people assisting the Chinese people, resolutely and bravely stand with the Korean people to eliminate the American aggressors!

　　忆朝鲜义勇军
　　刘奇芳
    我记得，在八、九年以前的一个冬天，天气很冷，驻在山西崞县的日本鬼子，经常由城内和阳明堡出发，惨无人道地杀人、放火和抢掠。老百姓整日被死亡威胁着，和今天在美帝侵略下的朝鲜人民一样。我那时才十一、二岁，是村中的一个儿童团员。
    有一天下午，忽然有三十多名朝鲜义勇军来到我村——夏长乐村，并在柳沟街住了一夜。他们对中国人民的抗日战争特别关心，到处写标语，散传单；晚间还召集了群众大会，给群众讲话，又以说大鼓的形式给大家宣传抗日救国的道理。中国人民受到的灾难，他们当成自己受到的一样！
    过了两天，我们听到这支朝鲜义勇军在匙村至东松章村间的滹沱河东岸打了一个胜仗，歼灭了日本鬼子兵十四、五个，缴获了“三八”枪、盒子枪好多支。在这次战斗中，一个朝鲜同志挂了花！他们在战斗中坚决勇敢，为了中国人民的生存与自由，不惜自己的生命与鲜血。他们同中国人民一道出生入死，尝尽艰苦，终于将日本帝国主义消灭，赢得胜利。
    今天，战争贩子杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟及那撮法西斯分子，向着我们中国的邻人朝鲜人民进行着疯狂的侵略战争，朝鲜人民遭受着比日本鬼子更为野蛮残暴的敌人的烧杀和绝灭人性的轰炸。朝鲜人民处在生与死、自由与奴隶的斗争边沿。
    现在，美帝的侵朝火焰已烧到我国大门口，严重地威胁着我国的和平与安全，并用飞机杀伤我国同胞。对美帝这些侵略罪行，是我们不能容许的，我们要救火！
    中国人民和朝鲜人民历来就是同生死、共患难的骨肉兄弟，昨天，朝鲜人民为了中国人民的解放事业曾流出了鲜血，今天，中国人民将要像朝鲜人民援助中国人民一样，坚决而勇敢地和朝鲜人民在一起将美国侵略者消灭！
