　　The U.S. Military's Bloody Massacre of the Korean People
　　Lies and Bloody Facts
　　U.S. President Truman, in a radio address in San Francisco on October 18th of this year, said: The sole purpose of the United States "in Korea is to establish peace and independence." However, the millions upon millions of Korean people massacred by the American beasts have used bloody facts to tell the people of the world: Truman and his ilk, the American imperialists, are the biggest liars and the most ferocious butchers. They wear the masks of "democracy," "freedom," and "peace," but in reality, they are the most savage murderers who kill without blinking an eye. The U.S. aggressor troops' towering crimes of killing, arson, rape, and plunder in the Korean War surpass even the atrocities of the Nazis in Europe and the Japanese devils in China!

　　Speaking solely of brutal massacres, even American journalists cannot conceal the bloody atrocities of the American barbarians in Korea. The American reactionary magazine *Time*, published on August 21st, carried a dispatch from its correspondent in Korea, Osborne, titled "Ugly War." Osborne admitted the inhuman and beastly behavior of the U.S. invading forces in Korea, saying: "These are ugly stories from an ugly war... I'm talking about this particularly terrifying war. Because we want to achieve victory, we force our soldiers to adopt the most savage actions and styles in the war. This savagery is not the ordinary, unavoidable savagery on the battlefield, but even more cruel and savage behavior than that. Regardless of whether there are enemies there or not, villages are completely destroyed, and refugees are indiscriminately killed."

　　In June of this year, the U.S. imperialists directed the Li puppet army to invade north of the 38th parallel, resulting in failure. Before retreating from each city, the U.S.-Li forces carried out a horrific massacre of the patriotic Korean people. In the short period from late June to mid-July, according to incomplete statistics, the U.S.-Li bandits massacred more than 22,500 Korean people in their retreat. The U.S. military also established 58 concentration camps in the small area of southeastern Korea, imprisoning 379,000 Korean people. Since the U.S. military re-occupied large areas of Korean territory, their massacres of the Korean people have become even more疯狂 (fengkuang - mad/crazy). They are establishing death concentration camps everywhere. Now, the Korean people are suffering unspeakable bloody massacres.

　　The Massacre Began in 1945

　　In fact, the U.S. imperialists' massacre of the Korean people began as early as 1945 after they occupied South Korea. From 1945 to July 1949, in less than four years, under the direct participation and command of the U.S. imperialists, the U.S.-Li bandits arrested 478,000 South Korean people and massacred 149,000 people.

　　According to Kim Hyo-seok, the former Minister of Home Affairs of the Li Seung-man puppet government, before this war, Li Seung-man's massacres of the people while suppressing guerrillas were all personally planned, directed, and participated in by Roberts, the head of the U.S. military advisory group. For example, during the year from April 1948 to May 1949, the U.S.-Li bandits massacred more than 35,000 people who participated in the Jeju Island uprising.

　　During the five years of U.S.-Li bandit rule in South Korea, Seoul was a large slaughterhouse. According to *Pravda* reporter Bochenko, the Americans, seeing that the gallows designed by Washington engineers could not execute political prisoners in Seoul prison in large numbers, ordered that typhoid patients who were prevalent in Seoul at the time be sent to the prison to spread typhoid, as a tool for executing prisoners. The bodies of those who were hanged, shot, and died of typhoid were thrown off cliffs, and then the Americans exploded the rocks to cover up this crime with rubble.

　　The Most Heinous Crime in World History

　　The U.S. military's massacre of the Korean people in this war of aggression was called "the most heinous crime in the world" by Alan Winnington, a reporter for the British *Daily Worker*.

　　The enemy fled Seoul too hastily to carry out a large-scale massacre. However, in the photos seized by the People's Army from the Americans, there were shots of the following: Next to a small village south of Seoul, the Americans and Li Seung-man's puppet troops encircled a group of farmers in an electric fence, and then used machine guns to strafe them from outside the fence.

　　In Incheon, before the Li puppet army fled, from 1:00 PM on June 29th to 11:30 PM on July 3rd, they massacred more than 1,000 peaceful people. Many families were killed, from infants to 83-year-old grandmothers. After Incheon was liberated on July 4th, massacred corpses were found everywhere on the coastal islands, on the shore, and in the streets. Many young men and women were still handcuffed. The bodies of the elderly were tied together with hemp ropes in groups of five or ten. The bodies of the teenagers were strangled with hemp ropes, ten to twenty tied together. The bodies of lovely infants were packed in grass bags, five to thirteen in each bag. Most of the massacred people had their hands tied behind their backs, their legs broken, stabbed all over their bodies, their abdomens cut open, and their limbs were mutilated.

　　A fourteen-year-old girl, Kim Jin-bok, who luckily survived, recounted the facts of her whole family, the old, weak, women and children, being massacred by the U.S.-Li bandits. At 10:00 PM on June 29th, the Li puppet army rushed into the girl's home. Unable to find her father and brother, they escorted all six members of her family – her 83-year-old grandmother, mother, sister, and two younger brothers – onto the U.S. military murder ship docked on the sea off Wolmido Island. The girl witnessed with her own eyes that the American bandits' pockets were filled with hundreds of rings, watches, and fountain pens. Her sister was dragged into another small cabin. The thugs tied up the people who were already handcuffed with hemp ropes, and then killed them; infants who were crying were thrown alive into the sea by the thugs. Both of her younger brothers were stabbed to death with bayonets.

　　After conducting an on-the-spot investigation, Alan Winnington, a reporter for the British *Daily Worker*, reported on the Daegu massacre by the U.S.-Li bandits, saying: The massacre in the Langmu Village valley in Daegu was carried out under the personal command and supervision of U.S. military officers, with the participation of U.S. truck drivers, using U.S. trucks, U.S. pistols, rifles, and carbines. On July 4th, the patriotic men and women imprisoned in Daegu Prison had their hands tied with wire, beaten unconscious with thick sticks, and then pushed onto trucks, one layer of people, padded with a layer of straw mats, stacked one layer after another like sardines. During the three consecutive days of the massacre on July 4th, 5th, and 6th, each truck carried more than fifty people, a total of more than sixty trucks. The trucks drove to the pit dug in the valley, and the prisoners were dragged out. The bottom layer was obviously already dead, and most were unconscious. Those who could still run were forced to kneel down and were shot, those who could not kneel were beaten to death on the ground, or killed with a single stroke of a Japanese military sword. After the pit was filled with corpses, the farmers were forced to spread a layer of soil to cover it. On the evening of July 16th, the People's Army crossed the Geum River north of Daegu, and time was running out. At dawn on the 17th, the bandits loaded the same way, with one hundred or more prisoners on each truck, and under the urging of the U.S. military officers, many prisoners were thrown alive into the earthen pits, piling the already dead on top of them. This day's massacre lasted from dawn until after midnight. At least 3,700 or more patriotic people were massacred. Winnington wrote: In that valley, the terrible smell requires great endurance to approach. There is only a thin layer of soil on those corpse pits, and you can see a pile of chaotic bones and decaying bodies. Some of the hands of the tied women are stretched on the ground; here, a leg is stretched out, the flesh is falling off the bones; some people's faces have been blown off, and some people's skulls have been split open at the back.

　　After the U.S. military fled Daegu, they created no-man's lands along the way. "Commanders ordered American soldiers to shoot anyone they saw" (Associated Press, Tokyo, August 2). The massacre in Jugong-ri and Imgye-ri in Yeongdong County is a bloody example. On August 3rd, the retreating U.S. military forced the local farmers to retreat south with them. The farmers were unwilling and instead went north together. As a result, the mad U.S. military used machine guns to strafe this group of unarmed refugees and dispatched planes to bomb them. The refugees fled to hide under the iron bridge near Hwanggan, but were surrounded by the U.S. military and concentratedly strafed with machine guns. More than 200 people were killed on the spot and more than 500 were injured. Hundreds of mothers died, leaving behind more than a dozen pitiful babies sucking on their mothers' nipples.

　　In order to create "no-man's lands," the American beasts would not even spare three-year-old girls and 67-year-old sick old men. In Mahan Village (transliteration) near Daegu, a three-year-old girl was crying and looking for her parents who had been driven south by the U.S. military, but she was shot to death by a U.S. military officer with a pistol. At the same time, according to an investigation by the Korean Fatherland Front: On July 28th, a 67-year-old sick old man at 47 Gwan-ri, Hwanggeum District, Yeongdong County, was hanged alive on a wooden stake by the U.S. military because he did not evacuate.

　　The U.S. military also tried every possible means to kill the residents who could not be left behind. When the last batch of U.S. troops retreated from Gimcheon, they put or injected poison into the drinking water, rice, chili sauce, and even apples.

　　The 379,000 refugees who were forcibly evacuated and imprisoned in the 58 concentration camps established by the U.S. military in southeastern Korea are on the verge of death. Even the reactionary Parisian newspaper *Le Monde* had to publish a dispatch from its reporter titled "SOS to the United Nations": "No words can describe the suffering of the people in these concentration camps. There have been Buchenwald concentration camps and Dachau concentration camps in the past (note: both were Hitler's concentration camps), but what I see here cannot be compared to Buchenwald or Dachau. This is truly a living hell. I see people who cannot get food or clothing dying of starvation."

　　Once again, Korea is transformed into a Hell and a Slaughterhouse

　　Since the U.S. invading forces landed in Incheon, every place they occupy is transformed once again into a bloody massacre field and a gloomy hell on earth. Seoul is a typical example.

　　As soon as the U.S.-Li forces invaded Seoul, under the slogan of "kill them all," they established special agent organizations such as the "Exterminate Communist Team," "Anti-Communist Team," and "Self-Government Team," and went around killing people in groups of three or five. For example, at 9:00 AM on September 28th, they collectively shot and killed more than 700 women and children at the Cheongnyangni Jungnyang Bridge embankment outside Dongdaemun alone. They also hung the corpses of the dead on utility poles. On the evening of October 2nd, two American soldiers and three Li puppet soldiers entered Cheokseon-dong (transliteration), dragged Li Ming-bok's family of four, who ran a grocery store, into the street, and forced the citizens who did not have time to escape to witness their bloody massacre. They hanged Li Ming-bok on a utility pole, and hanged his ten-year-old boy and six-year-old girl beside him. Li Ming-bok's wife, who fainted after watching her husband and children being cruelly massacred by the devils, was gang-raped by the two American soldiers. After that, they threw this half-dead woman into a pile of burning fire to death. Yoon Deok-jeong's wife, who lived in Dongdaemun, was eight months pregnant, and because her husband went out to take refuge, she was also cruelly massacred by the American devils.

　　*New York Times* reporter Glutznyer wrote: In Seoul, "you can often see a man with his hands tied, walking dejectedly; his wife is tied to his back with a rope, her hands are also tied, and the baby is wrapped in cloth on her back." In the notorious Seoul Seodaemun Prison, among thousands of prisoners, there were more than 1,200 women, including 300 mothers with nursing babies. One young woman, holding her baby who had just been born six hours ago, was also locked up in a cold, damp, and overcrowded prison.

　　Seoul is constantly massacring people in batches. British *Daily Mirror* reporter Greenlees wrote in a dispatch titled "Stop This Barbarity!": "I saw twenty-five men and two women being executed. The prisoners' hands were tied behind their backs and dragged out and pushed onto trucks." "On a small mountain four miles from Seoul, prisoners were dragged in batches to a shallow beach and shot."

　　After recounting the massacre atrocities in Seoul, *U.S. Compass* reporter Martin wrote: "It is obvious that there is more bloodshed in the countryside." This is indeed true. Li Joon-hwa, a farmer from Sinan-ri, Goseong County, Gangwon Province, who escaped from the clutches of the U.S.-Li bandits, accused the bestial acts of the U.S.-Li bandits that she witnessed with her own eyes. After the U.S.-Li army entered the village, they searched every farmer's house. Everyone who stayed in the village was arrested and interrogated without exception: "What do you do?" "Can't you say it faster?" Before the words were finished, they used bayonets to stab the eyes of the people being interrogated. The person whose eyes were stabbed screamed and fell to the ground. They poured cold water on him. Blood and water mixed together and flowed on the ground. As soon as the fallen person woke up, the barbaric torture that could not be found anywhere in the world began again. The enemy pressed them with iron bars, and then used sharp knives to cut off their eyes and cut their throats.

　　The U.S.-Li bandits have currently established about ten death concentration camps in the occupied areas. On the Ongjin Peninsula alone, more than 100,000 patriotic people are dying in concentration camps. Every night, large-scale massacres are carried out in the valleys around the concentration camps. Many people have also suffered purely American-style torture: their eyes were blinded by electric lights, and their fingernails were stripped off! Many U.S. military doctors and scientists walked into the concentration camps pretending to treat the prisoners, but in reality, they secretly put murderous chemical agents and vaccines on living people for experiments. Everyone in the concentration camps lived on the open mud, and their clothes and shoes were all taken away. People had to lie close to each other, maintaining the body temperature of their thin bodies. Tae In-hee (transliteration), a truck driver from the Ongjin Arsenal who escaped from the Ongjin Peninsula concentration camp, said: The people in this concentration camp do not get any food. The grass on the ground in the concentration camp was all eaten, and the bark of large trees and bushes was also eaten. Hundreds of people die of starvation every day. Men, women, old and young in the concentration camp cannot escape death.

　　Blood Debt Must Be Paid in Blood!

　　The purpose of the U.S. invading forces in carrying out crazy massacres is to attempt to suppress the people's resistance with bloody terror and drown the people's fighting spirit in blood. However, the heroic Korean people have not been intimidated by the brutal massacres of the invaders. On the contrary, the Korean people are using more heroic and determined struggles to defend their own motherland and people. The Korean people are demanding blood debts from the executioners with tenacious resistance and counterattacks on the front lines and with brave guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines!

### 美军对朝鲜人民的血腥大屠杀

　　美军对朝鲜人民的血腥大屠杀
    谎言和血腥的事实
    美国总统杜鲁门今年十月十八日在旧金山发表广播演讲说：美国“在朝鲜的唯一目的是建立和平与独立”。但是，被美国野兽们屠杀的千千万万的朝鲜人民，已经用血淋淋的事实告诉全世界人民：杜鲁门之流的美国帝国主义者，是最大的骗子和最凶恶的屠夫，他们戴着“民主”、“自由”、“和平”的面具，实际上却是最野蛮的杀人不贬眼的凶手。美国侵略者兽军在朝鲜战争中杀人放火，奸淫掳掠的滔天罪行，实比纳粹在欧洲、日寇在中国的暴行，有过之而无不及！
    单就残暴的屠杀而论，甚至连美国记者也无法掩盖美国野蛮人在朝鲜的血腥暴行。八月二十一日出版的美国反动刊物《时代》杂志，刊登了该刊驻朝鲜记者奥斯本所写的题为“丑恶的战争”的通讯。奥斯本承认美国侵略军在朝鲜的毫无人性的野兽行为说：“这是丑恶战争中的丑恶故事，……我说的是这一场特别恐怖的战争。因为我们要获取胜利，所以就强迫自己的士兵在战争中采取最野蛮的行动和作风。这种野蛮不是在战场上普通的不可避免的野蛮，而且比那还更残忍更野蛮的行为。不管那里有没有敌人，见了村庄就彻底地摧毁，对于难民无分别地杀害。”
    今年六月，美帝指使李伪军向三八线以北进犯失败。美李军在从每一个城市溃退之前，都对朝鲜爱国人民进行了惨绝人寰的大屠杀。从六月下旬到七月中旬的短短期间，据不完全统计，美李匪军在溃败途中竟屠杀了朝鲜人民共达二万二千五百人以上，美军又在朝鲜东南部的狭小地带设立了五十八个集中营，囚禁了朝鲜人民三十七万九千人。自从美军重行侵占了朝鲜大片土地之后，他们对朝鲜人民的屠杀更加疯狂。他们正到处设立死亡集中营。现在，朝鲜人民正在遭受着惨不忍闻的血腥屠杀。
    屠杀从一九四五年就开始了
    事实上，美帝国主义者屠杀朝鲜人民，早自一九四五年占领南朝鲜后就已经开始了。从一九四五年到一九四九年七月，在这不到四年期间，在美帝国主义者直接参与和直接指挥下，美李匪帮共逮捕南朝鲜人民四十七万八千人，屠杀了十四万九千人。
    据前李承晚傀儡政府内务长官金孝锡揭露：这次战争之前，李承晚在讨伐游击队时对人民的大屠杀，都是美国军事顾问团团长罗伯兹亲自计划、指挥和参加的。例如，从一九四八年四月到一九四九年五月的一年期间，美李匪帮就一共屠杀了济州岛起义人民三万五千多人。
    在美李匪帮统治南朝鲜的五年内，汉城就是一座大屠场。据真理报记者波诚科报道：美国人鉴于华盛顿工程师所设计的绞架不能大批处死汉城监狱中的政治犯，曾下令把当时汉城流行的伤寒病人送到监狱来，传播伤寒病，作为处决囚犯的工具。被绞死、枪杀、和死于伤寒病的人们的尸体，被抛下悬崖，然后美国人则爆炸了岩石，用碎石掩盖住这一罪迹。
    世界历史上最恶毒的罪行
    美国军队在这次侵略战争中对朝鲜人民的大屠杀，英国工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁顿称之为“世界上空前最恶毒的罪行”。
    敌人从汉城逃跑得太仓促，来不及进行大屠杀。但在人民军所缴获的美国人的照片中，有着这样的镜头：在汉城以南的一个小村旁边，美国人和李承晚伪军把一群农民圈在电纲中，然后在电纲外面用机枪扫射。
    在仁川，李伪军逃跑之前，从六月二十九日午后一时到七月三日夜半十一时，一共屠杀了和平人民一千多人，许多人全家被杀，从婴儿到八十三岁的老太太都不能幸免。七月四日仁川解放后，在沿海的岛屿、在海岸、在街头，到处都发现被惨杀的尸体。很多青年男女的尸体还扣着手铐。老年人的尸体是五具或十具在一起用麻绳捆着。少年们的尸体是用麻绳勒着脖子，十个到二十个勒在一起。可爱的婴儿们的尸体，则是五个到十三个地装在草袋子里。被屠杀的人们大都是双手反缚，两腿拆断，遍体刺伤，开膛破腹，被弄得四肢残缺不全。
    一个侥幸生还的十四岁的女孩金珍福，曾诉说她全家老弱妇孺被美李匪帮屠杀的事实。六月二十九日夜晚十点钟，李伪军冲到女孩家中，找不到她的爸爸和哥哥，就把她全家六口——八十三岁的老祖母、母亲、姐姐和两个小弟弟，押送到停泊在月尾岛海面上的美军杀人船上。女孩亲眼看到美国强盗们的皮包里装满了成百的戒指、手表和自来水笔。她的姐姐被拉到另一个小舱里。暴徒们把已经扣上手铐的人们，再用麻绳绑住，然后加以杀害；正在哭着的婴儿，被暴徒们活活地扔到海里。她的两个小弟弟也都被用刺刀戳死了。
    英国工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁敦在经过实地调查之后，报道美李匪帮在大田的大屠杀说：在大田郎武村山谷中的屠杀，是在美国军官的亲自指挥监督下，美国卡车司机的参加下，用美国卡车、美国的手枪、步枪和卡宾枪进行的。七月四日，被囚禁在大田监狱里的男女爱国志士们，双手都被用铁丝绑起来，用粗大的棍棒打昏，然后推上卡车，放一层人，垫一层草垫，一层又一层象沙丁鱼一样地堆积起来。在七月四日、五日、六日接连三天的屠杀中，每辆卡车装了五十多人，一共装了六十多卡车。卡车开到山谷中掘好了的坑边，囚徒都被拖了出来。最底下一层的显然已经死了，大多数都昏昏迷迷。那些还能跑的都被迫跪下，加以枪毙，那些不能跪下的，都被打死在地上，或者用日本军刀一刀杀死。土坑里堆满尸体之后，就强迫农民铺上一层土掩盖起来。七月十六日晚间，人民军越过了大田北面的锦江，时间不多了。十七日拂晓，匪徒们用同样方法在每辆卡车上装了一百或一百名以上的囚犯，在美国军官的催促下，许多囚犯被活着投入土抗，把已经死了的堆在他们上面。这一天的屠杀从拂晓进行到午夜以后。至少屠杀了爱国志士三千七百人以上。魏宁顿写道：在那山谷里，可怕的气味需有极大的忍受才能走近。那些尸坑上仅有一层薄土，可以看到一堆乱骨头和腐烂的人身。有些被绑着的妇女的手伸在地面上；在这里，有一只腿伸出来，皮肉正从骨头上脱落；有些人的面孔被炸掉，有些人的头盖骨后部已经裂开。
    美军在逃出大田之后，沿途制造无人区。美国“指挥官命令美国兵看到人就开枪”（美联社东京八月二日电）。永同县朱共里与林界里的残杀，就是一个血腥的例子。八月三日，溃退的美军强迫当地的农民随他们向南撤退。农民们不愿，反而相率北上。于是，疯狂的美军就用机枪扫射这批手无寸铁的难民，并出动飞机加以炸射。难民们逃到黄涧附近的铁桥下躲避，又被美军包围，用机枪集中扫射。当场死二百多人，伤五百多人。死了上百的母亲，留下了十几个可怜的噙着母亲乳头的婴儿。
    美国野兽们为了制造“无人区”，连三岁女孩和六十七岁的患病老人都不肯放过。在大田附近的马汉村（译音），有一个三岁的小女孩正在哭着找她的被美军赶向南方的爸爸妈妈，竟被一个美国军官用手枪打死。同时，据朝鲜祖国战线调查：七月二十八日，永同县黄金区官里四十七番地的六十七岁的患病老人，因未逃难，被美军吊在木桩上活活勒死。
    美军还千方百计地要杀害那些没法留下不走的居民。最后一批美军从金泉溃逃时，最后在饮水、米谷、辣酱、甚至苹果中，都放进了或注射了毒药。
    被囚禁于美军在朝鲜东南部设立的五十八个集中营里的被强迫撤退的三十七万九千难民，正处在死亡的边缘。就连巴黎反动的《世界报》也不得不发表了该报记者的“向联合国呼救”的通讯：“没有言语能够形容出这些集中营的人民所受的痛苦。过去曾有过布痕瓦尔德集中营、达豪集中营（按都是希特勒的集中营），但是，我在这里看到的，却不是布痕瓦尔德集中营或达豪集中营所能比拟的。这的确是个人间地狱。我看到得不到衣食的人们因饥饿而快要死亡。”
    又把朝鲜变成地狱和屠场
    美国侵略军自仁川登陆后，每占领一地，就把这一地方重新变成一个血腥遍野的大屠杀场和阴森的人间地狱，汉城便是一个典型的例子。
    美李军刚侵入汉城，就在“斩尽杀绝”的口号下，成立了所谓“灭共队”、“反共队”、“自治队”等特务组织，三五成群地到处杀人。如九月二十八日上午九时，仅在东大门外清凉里中良桥堤坊一地，他们就集体枪杀了妇女和儿童七百多人，他们并把死者的尸体挂在电线杆上。十月二日晚间，两个美国兵、三个李伪军走进赤善洞（译音），将开杂货铺的李明福一家四口人拉到街上，并强迫集合来不及逃走的市民，来亲眼看他们的血腥屠杀。他们把李明福吊死在电杆上，又把他的十岁男孩和六岁女孩吊死在他的身旁。亲眼看着丈夫和孩子们被鬼子残酷屠杀而昏倒的李明福的妻子，被那两个美国兵加以轮奸。之后，他们竟又把这个已经半死的妇女投到火堆里烧死了。住在东大门的尹德正的妻子，怀孕已八个月，因为丈夫出去避难，也被美国鬼子们残酷屠杀了。
    美国纽约时报记者葛鲁兹尼尔写道：在汉城“常常可以看到一个被缚着手的男子，垂头丧气地走着；用绳子拴在他背后的是他的妻子，她的两手也被缚着，婴儿就用布缠在她的背上。”在著名残酷的汉城西大门监狱，数千名囚犯中有一千二百多妇女，其中有三百个母亲都带着吃奶的婴儿。有一个年轻妇女抱着她刚生下六小时的婴儿，也被关在阴冷潮湿拥挤不堪的牢狱里。
    汉城不断成批地屠杀着人民。英国每日镜报记者格林利斯在一篇题为“制止这种野蛮行为！”的通讯中写道：“我曾看到二十五个男子和两个妇女被执行死刑。囚犯们双手倒缚，被拖出去推上卡车。”“在离汉城四英里的小山上，囚犯们被一批批地拖向一个浅滩旁枪毙。”
    美国指南针日报记者马丁在叙述了汉城的屠杀暴行以后写道：“很明显的，在乡间还有更多的流血事件。”这确是事实。从美李匪军魔掌逃出的江原道高城县新安里农妇李俊花，控诉了亲眼见到的美李匪军的兽行。美李军进入村庄之后，就搜查每一个农家。留在村中的人都一个不留地被抓去审问：“你是做什么的？”“不能快点说吗？”话没有说完，就用刺刀去刺被审问的人们的眼睛。眼睛被刺的人惨叫一声摔倒了。他们又向他泼一身冷水。血和水混在一起，流在地上。摔倒的人刚清醒过来，就又开始了全世界都找不到的野蛮酷刑。敌人用铁棍把他们压住，然后用锋利的小刀割掉他们的两眼，割破他们的喉咙。
    美李匪军目前在侵占区设立了约十座死亡集中营。仅在瓮津半岛上，就有十万以上的爱国人民在集中营里奄奄待毙。每天夜里，集中营周围的山谷里都进行着大规模的屠杀。有许多人还受尽了纯粹美国式的酷刑：眼睛被电光射瞎，指甲被剥去！许多美国军医与科学人员走进集中营假装给囚徒们治病，实际上却是偷偷地把杀人的化学药剂与菌苗放在活人身上做试验。集中营里的人们全都住在露天的泥地上，衣服鞋子全被拿走，人们只好一个紧靠一个地躺着，保持他们枯瘦身体的体温。从瓮津半岛集中营逃出来的瓮津军火库的汽车司机泰仁希（译音）说：这个集中营里的人们得不到任何食物。集中营里地上的青草全被吃光，大树与灌木的树皮也被吃完了。每天饿死的人们数以百计。集中营里的男女老幼都不免一死。
    血债要用血来还！
    美国侵略军进行疯狂屠杀的目的，是企图用血腥恐怖镇压人民的反抗，用鲜血淹没人民的斗志。但是，英勇的朝鲜人民并没有给侵略者的残暴屠杀所吓倒。相反地，朝鲜人民以更英勇更坚决的斗争，来保卫他们自己的祖国和人民。朝鲜人民正在前线用顽强的抵抗与反击在敌后用勇敢的游击战争，向刽子手们索还着血债！
