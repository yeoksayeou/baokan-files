    Thugs and Murderers

    In 1945, after Japan surrendered, more than twenty communication soldiers from the U.S. Marine Corps were hosted by the Kuomintang reactionaries at the Fifth Branch of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau (Mishi Street). At that time, the Kuomintang Telecommunications Bureau Chief quickly ordered the Fifth Branch to vacate the best buildings and kitchens, and added Western-style furniture. He also specially hired two translators and three workers to serve the American masters.
    After these American soldiers moved into the Fifth Branch, people could constantly hear women's screams and cries from there. This was because the American soldiers were raping Chinese women. One night, around nine o'clock, American soldiers locked a young woman in her twenties in the bathhouse. After being gang-raped by five beasts in human clothing, they also committed sodomy. The workers heard the victim's hoarse screams, and their hearts were broken. Worker Zhao Wenzhong angrily told the reporter: "Anyone who is still Chinese cannot bear to hear that kind of sound! At that time, I really wanted to beat those bastards severely." However, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, what could the workers do? At that time, they had no choice but to call the police to drag the victim out. She was a woman from a poor family, wearing only a thin, faded floral cotton robe in the freezing weather. Another afternoon, an American officer brought a young woman. Judging by her dress and behavior, she was probably a student. This woman had come several times before, reportedly surnamed Wang. On this day, she wore a gray suede coat and blue suit pants, talking and laughing with the American officer as they walked. But when night fell, screams from this woman, the beastly soldiers' laughter, and the sound of belts whipping suddenly came from the third floor. At this time, the workers couldn't bear it any longer. A worker named Zhao Hanzhong rushed to the third floor regardless of everything. As soon as he reached the second floor entrance, the woman was kicked down from the third floor by the American officer. An American soldier chased after her. This woman was stark naked, rushing to Zhao Hanzhong for help like a madwoman. At this time, Zhao Hanzhong summoned his courage and stopped the American soldier chasing after her. The woman ran to the reception room and just cried loudly. The workers felt extremely sad, and Zhao Hanzhong quickly took off his coat and put it on her. How could she go back without clothes? Old Liu, a worker in his fifties, spent more than an hour persuading them to get her clothes back. How many times did things like this happen? People can't remember now.
    In the spring of 1946, Zhao Deming, a part-time worker in the Fifth Branch's repair shop, was knocked down in the yard by a jeep driven by American soldier Andersivid (transliteration). The jeep injured Zhao Deming's face, knocked out three of his teeth, and his left foot was trapped under the wheel. He immediately fainted. The workers surrounded the American murderer who caused the accident. At this time, the American murderer had no choice but to pretend to take the injured person to the Japanese Qingmu Hospital for treatment. In reality, the hospital was just going through the motions. Zhao Deming had to go home to recuperate. However, his family was very poor. His father died when he was thirteen, and now he has a fifty-seven-year-old mother who relies on Zhao Deming's odd jobs to survive. In this way, Zhao Deming's mother had no choice but to beg and borrow money to treat her son. Under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, workers would be fired if they took more than a month's leave. Zhao Deming rested for a month, and before his injury was fully healed, he went to work limping. Now, when Zhao Deming mentions this matter, his eyes are filled with anger. He said indignantly: "That time the American pig didn't kill me, but now it's time for me to take revenge."
    These American soldiers were also a group of thugs who did all kinds of evil. After eating, they had nothing to do, so they often drove jeeps and ran around the yard, knocking the coal piles and equipment in the yard into a mess. Sometimes, when workers were arranging wires in the yard, American soldiers would suddenly start shooting, scaring the workers terribly, while the American soldiers laughed beside them. Sometimes they would run to the third-floor platform and throw lit firecrackers on the head of the Xiao family's daughter next door; or wrap vegetable leaves with dirty water and throw them at the neighboring women; or break the neighboring family's windowpanes with slingshots. Mrs. Yu and Mrs. Chen from the neighboring family told the reporter: "At that time, as long as we saw American soldiers on the platform, we would hide at home and not dare to come out." American soldiers sometimes stood in groups of three or five at the door, harassing women passing by. Therefore, as soon as it got dark, women didn't dare to pass through this area.

    流氓与凶手

    一九四五年，日本投降后，美国海军陆战队的二十多个通讯兵，被国民党反动派招待在北京电信局电话五分局（米市大街）。当时国民党电信局长，赶快命令五分局腾出最好的楼房、伙房，并添置了西式家具。还特地雇了两个翻译，三个工友，专门伺候美国主子。
    这批美国兵住进五分局以后，人们就能不断地从这儿听到妇女的惨叫声、哭泣声。这是美国兵在奸污中国妇女。有一天夜里，九点钟光景，美国兵把一个二十来岁的年青妇女关在澡塘里，五个衣冠禽兽轮奸后，又鸡奸她，工人们听到遭难者嘶哑的惨叫声，心都碎裂了。工人赵文忠气愤地对记者说：“那种声音，只要他还是中国人，谁都听不下去的！那时候，我真想狠狠地揍狗日的一顿。”但是，在国民党反动派统治下，工人们有什么办法呢？那时只好叫来警察把那位遭难者死拉活拖的救了出来。这是一个穷人家的妇女，数九天，还只穿着一件很薄的褪了色的花棉袍。又有一天下午，美国军官带来了一个年青的妇女，看她的装束和行动，可能是个学生。这位妇女已来过几次，据说姓王，这天来时，她穿着一件灰色的翻毛大衣，蓝色的西服裤，和美国军官边走边说笑。但是到夜深人静的时候，三楼上忽然传来了这个妇女的惨叫声，兽兵的狂笑声，和皮带的抽打声。这时逼得工友们实在忍不住了，有个叫赵翰忠的就不顾一切地跑上三楼去，他刚到二楼口上，那个妇女被美国军官一脚从三楼上踢下来了。有个美国兵紧追下来。这个妇女一丝不挂，亦裸裸的像疯子似的扑向赵翰忠求救。这时赵翰忠鼓起勇气，拦住了追赶的美国兵，这个妇女跑到传达室只是放声大哭。工人们心里难过极了，赵翰忠赶忙脱下自己的大衣给她穿上。没有衣服怎么回去呢？五十多岁的工友老刘，费了一个多钟头的口舌，才把她的衣服要了出来。这样的事情究竟发生过多少次呢？现在人们都记不清了。
    一九四六年春天，五分局修配厂的勤工赵德明，在院子里，被美国兵安德西维德（译音）的吉普车撞倒了。吉普车把赵德明的脸撞伤了，牙齿撞掉了三颗，左脚压在车轮下面，他立刻昏过去了。工人们围住肇事的美国凶手，这时，美国凶手不得不假心假意地把伤者送到日本清木医院治疗。实际上医院里只是敷衍应付。赵德明不得不回家去休养。可是他家里很穷，十三岁时就死了父亲，现在有个五十七岁的老母亲，就靠赵德明打杂服工役过日子。这样，赵德明的母亲不得不东求西借，借钱给自己儿子治疗。在国民党反动派统治时期，工人们请假超过一个月就要开除。赵德明休息一个月，伤还没有全好，就跛着脚上班去了。现在，赵德明提起这件事，就气得眼里冒火，他激愤地说：“那一回美国猪子没有压死我，现在可是我报仇的时候了。”
    这些美国兵，还是一群无恶不作的流氓。他们吃了饭没事干，常常开起吉普车，满院子乱跑，撞得院子里的煤堆、器材乱七八糟。有时候工人们正在院子里收拾电线，美国兵突然放起枪来，工人们吓得不得了，美国兵却在一旁哈哈大笑。有时跑到三楼平台上，把燃着的爆竹，丢到东邻萧家女孩子的头上；或者把菜叶子包上了脏水，打到邻家的妇女身上；用弹弓打碎邻家的玻璃窗。邻家的于太太、陈太太告诉记者说：“那时候，我们只要看见美国兵在平台上，就躲在家里不敢出来。”美国兵有时还三五成群地站在门口，调戏路过的妇女。因此天一黑，妇女就不敢在这一带经过。
