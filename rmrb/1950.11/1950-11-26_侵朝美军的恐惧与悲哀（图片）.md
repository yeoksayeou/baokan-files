　　The Fear and Sorrow of the Invading American Army in Korea
　　The two photos published on the right were originally published in the reactionary American publication "Newsweek" on October 9th. The first shows two American soldiers crying bitterly because their comrades blindly lost their lives in the shameful war of aggression; the other is a graveyard of the U.S. Marine Corps in Korea, filled with despairing sorrow. These two photos fully illustrate the miserable situation of the American invading army, which has fallen into despairing fear and sorrow due to the heavy blows suffered from the Korean People's Army in the unjust war they are waging.

　　侵朝美军的恐惧与悲哀
    右面刊登的两张照片，原载于十月九日出版的美国反动刊物《新闻周刊》上，第一幅两个美国兵因为他们的同伴在可耻的侵略战争中盲目地送了命，而抱头痛哭；另一幅则是充满了绝望的悲哀的美国侵朝海军陆战队的坟场。这两张照片，充分说明了美国侵略军由于他们所进行的不义的战争遭受了朝鲜人民军的沉重打击而陷入了绝望的恐惧与悲哀的惨境。
