　　Philippine Mercenaries Aiding US Aggression in Korea
    Discriminated Against by US Military, Still Without Winter Clothing
    Commander Requests Troops Be Recalled Home
    [Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch] Philippine mercenaries aiding US aggression in Korea have yet to receive winter clothing due to discrimination by the US military. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Manila on the 19th, Colonel Azurin, the commander of the Philippine forces fighting in Korea, telegraphed his country requesting the troops be recalled. The reason given was: "Without winter clothing and equipment, they cannot withstand the severe cold." Azurin protested to the US military authorities about the discrimination in which the US "did not adequately equip his soldiers." Agence France-Presse stated that Manila "regretted" this.

    【新华社二十一日讯】助美侵朝的菲律宾雇佣兵，由于受到美军的歧视，迄今尚未穿上冬衣。据法新社马尼拉十九日讯：在朝鲜作战的菲律宾军指挥官阿佐林上校曾打电报回国，要求把军队召回。原因是：“没有冬季服装和装备，抵挡不住严寒的气候。”阿佐林对美国“给他的士兵装备不充分”的歧视，向美军当局提出抗议。法新社称：马尼拉方面对此“感到遗憾”。
