Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, November 14th (TASS dispatch): According to the Imroze newspaper, the Zamindar newspaper of Lahore, Pakistan, recently reported that its editor-in-chief, Maulana, obtained intelligence about the US plans for Kashmir from a British Member of Parliament. According to this intelligence, the United States does not need the Kashmir issue to be resolved. The United States needs to prove that India and Pakistan cannot resolve the Kashmir issue on their own. In this way, the Americans believe that the only solution to the problem is to declare the Jammu State (located in southern Kashmir) as a "free and independent territory under the control of the United Nations." Imroze newspaper said: "This is to place the Jammu State directly under the control of the United States. The purpose of this plan is for the United States to obtain military bases within the territory of Jammu State, because Kashmir is close to the Soviet Union."

The newspaper also said, "The intentions of the United States have long been known. In July last year, the US Information Service issued a statement, clearly stating: The State Department pays close attention to the Kashmir issue, just like it pays attention to the tribal issues of the people living in the border areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan, because these areas have great strategic importance. The statement also said that the United States wants to establish a general "defense" line from Korea, through Taiwan, to Pakistan. This defense line will be connected to Turkey, which has already received US "aid". After this statement was issued by the United States, the US envoy Jessup traveled to various countries in the Middle East and Far East. He visited Pakistan and inspected the Khyber Pass, which is close to the Soviet border. We are not surprised by the discovery of the Zamindar newspaper. What surprises us very much is the policy adopted by our leaders, who do not protest against the evil plans of the United States. The representatives of our government have participated in the meetings of the Commonwealth (referring to the British Commonwealth) countries, in which the issue of common defense was discussed. Bevin recently stated that the common defense of this Commonwealth country may be linked to the Atlantic Pact in the future. All of this means that our country will be used by the Anglo-American bloc as an anti-Soviet military base." The newspaper advocated defending India and Pakistan so that they are "free from foreign interference."

### 巴基斯坦报纸揭露  美阴谋侵占克什米尔  并企图利用为反苏军事基地

　　巴基斯坦报纸揭露
    美阴谋侵占克什米尔
    并企图利用为反苏军事基地
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社喀喇蚩十四日讯：据伊姆罗兹报称，巴基斯坦拉合尔的查明达尔报最近报道，该报主笔毛兰纳曾从一位英国议会议员那里，得到关于美国对于克什米尔的计划的情报。根据这一情报，美国并不需要克什米尔问题得到解决。美国需要证明印度与巴基斯坦不能自行解决克什米尔问题，这样一来，美国人就认为问题的唯一解决办法是宣布查谟邦（按在克什米尔南部）为“在联合国控制之下的自由而独立的领土”，伊姆罗兹报说：“这就是把查谟邦直接置于美国的控制之下。这一计划的目的是为美国在查谟邦境内取得军事基地，因为克什米尔靠近苏联。”
    该报又说，“美国的意图早已为人所知。去年七月间美国新闻处曾发表声明，明白地说：国务院很注意克什米尔问题，就像注意居住在阿富汗与巴基斯坦边境地区的部落的问题一样，因为这些区域具有很大的战略重要性。这个声明还说，美国很想从朝鲜经台湾直到巴基斯坦建立一道总的“防”线。这道防线将与已经得到美“援”的土耳其连接起来。在美国的这一声明发表以后，美国的特使耶塞普曾旅行中东与远东各国。他访问了巴基斯坦，并视察了接近苏联边境的开伯尔隘道。我们对于查明达尔报的发现毫不惊异，我们所非常惊异的是我们的领袖们所采取的政策，他们对于美国的恶毒计划竟然不提抗议。我国政府的代表们曾参加联邦（按指不列颠联邦）各国的会议，会中曾讨论到共同的防御问题，贝文最近声明说，这个联邦国家的共同防御将来或者要与大西洋公约联结起来。所有这一切都是说，我国将为英美集团所利用，作为反苏的军事基地”。该报主张保卫印度与巴基斯坦，使它们“不受外国干涉。”
