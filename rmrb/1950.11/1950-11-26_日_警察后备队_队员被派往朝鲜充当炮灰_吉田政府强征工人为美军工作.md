　　Xinhua News Agency, TASS, dispatch from the 19th: United Press reported: A member of a certain unit of the Japanese "Police Reserve Force" belonging to a military camp near Kami-machi, Yamagata Prefecture, said on November 13th: It has been decided that the unit will dispatch 200 members to Korea in the near future. There are currently 3,600 members undergoing training at the camp.
　　Xinhua News Agency: The Japanese Yoshida government is forcibly conscripting Japanese workers to engage in military work for the American occupiers. According to United Press, "Emergency Workers for Toyooka Airfield" were recruited in various parts of Saitama Prefecture in mid-October. Although the "Vocational Stabilization Offices" in various parts of the prefecture recruited everywhere, few people applied. The "Vocational Stabilization Office" in Urawa threatened unemployed workers registered at the office with "not introducing jobs" and forced them to apply. According to workers who were forcibly conscripted to work at the airport, they were all forced to leave their fingerprints there, and the work registration books previously issued to them by the "Vocational Stabilization Office" were also withheld. Therefore, even if they are dissatisfied with the work, it is impossible to resign.

　　日“警察后备队”队员被派往朝鲜充当炮灰
    吉田政府强征工人为美军工作
    【新华社讯】塔斯社十九日电引联合通讯社消息：属于山形县神町附近军营的日本“警察后备队”某部队的一队员，十一月十三日说：该部队已被决定在最近派遣队员二百名到朝鲜去。目前在该营受训的队员共有三千六百人。
    【新华社讯】日本吉田政府强迫征募日本工人为美国占领者从事军事性工作。据联合通讯社讯：崎玉县各地曾在十月中旬招募“丰冈飞机场紧急工作人员”。该县各地“职业安定所”虽四出招募，但应募的人仍寥寥无几。浦和地方的“职业安定所”以“不介绍职业”威胁在该所登记的失业工人，强迫他们应募。据被强征到飞机场去工作的工人说：他们在那里都被迫留下手印，“职业安定所”以前发给他们的工作登记簿也被扣留起来。因此，即使对工作不满，也不可能辞退。
