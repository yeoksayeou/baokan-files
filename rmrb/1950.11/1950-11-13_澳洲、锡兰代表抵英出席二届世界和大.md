　　Xinhua News Agency, 9th: According to Reuter's London dispatch: Representatives from Australia and Ceylon attending the Second World Peace Congress have now arrived in England. Brand, a representative of the southwestern Australian steelworkers' union, told reporters on the 6th: "I am a member of the Australian Labor Party, and I am likely to be expelled from the party for attending this conference, but this does not affect me, because participating in the struggle to save peace is more important." Ceylonese representative Jayasinha is a Ceylonese senator and vice-chairman of the Ceylon General Federation of Trade Unions. He told reporters about the situation of the peace movement in Ceylon, saying that the vast majority of the people of Ceylon hate war and support the peace movement. All the senior Buddhist monks in Ceylon have signed the peace declaration, and two of them have joined the National Peace Committee.
　　The peace movement in Britain is developing. In northern England, peace trucks have set out for towns and villages across the land to publicize the great significance of defending peace to the people. In all the towns along the way to Sheffield, welcoming committees have been organized to receive foreign delegations attending the Second World Peace Congress.
