　　Accusation of Atrocities by American Aircraft
    ——An Interview with Injured Driver Xu Guochen of Linjiang Station
    By our reporter Chen Ji
    "American planes broke my left hand, but I can still use my right hand to seek revenge!" Xu Guochen, a driver from the Linjiang Locomotive Depot, took his injured left hand out of his coat pocket and banged it on the table with resolute determination, angrily denouncing the atrocities of American planes strafing Linjiang Station and violating China's territorial sovereignty. Only a thumb remained on his left hand, and the skin on his palm had grown onto the back of his hand, resembling a fleshy, scarred tumor. This is the mark of the American aggressors' blood debt, and it must be forever etched in the hearts of every Chinese person: blood debts must be repaid with blood.
    At around 11:00 a.m. on August 27th, Xu Guochen and several fellow workers were quietly loading coal onto a locomotive on the coal platform at the Linjiang Locomotive Depot when suddenly four planes swooped down from above. When they clearly saw the white star markings of American planes, Xu Guochen suddenly realized that the three locomotives parked on the tracks were in danger of being bombed. He quickly jumped off the coal platform to rescue the locomotives. At this moment, the American planes began strafing him with their machine guns. The bullets whizzed past him. Braving the rain of bullets, he ran to locomotive "No. 928," bravely opened the steam valve, and attempted to drive the locomotive out of Linjiang Station. When the locomotive had traveled more than twenty meters, he noticed that the switch ahead had not been moved. Continuing to drive forward would cause an accident. He skillfully stopped the locomotive, quickly jumped off, and crawled under it. The crazed American planes continued to strafe "No. 928" from an altitude of several hundred meters. A bullet landed in front of Xu Guochen, hitting his left hand and shattering all four fingers, causing blood to spurt out. Xu Guochen tightly gripped his bloody left hand with his right hand and moved his body backward. Enduring the pain, he thought to himself: "Even if they kill me, the people of the whole country will avenge me; if they don't kill me, I will demand this blood debt." The American planes continued to strafe, and the locomotive's cylinder was also broken, spewing out hot steam. Xu Guochen crawled out from under the locomotive, gritting his teeth, and another bullet flew past his head. He calmly ran towards the operations room to find someone to rescue the locomotive, which was on fire. When his fellow workers saw that his left hand was bleeding and his face was covered with mud and sand, they rushed to bandage his wound, but he said, "Hurry up and save the locomotive!" The American planes strafed Linjiang Station for more than ten minutes before fleeing southeast. "No. 928" locomotive sustained a total of one hundred and two injuries, with seventy-eight bullet holes. One of the water gauges was also destroyed, and the extent of the damage was equivalent to a medium repair.
    Xu Guochen was taken to the Tonghua Railway Hospital by his fellow workers. After staying there for a few days, his wound became infected, and his entire left arm swelled up, requiring the incision of the abscesses. The doctor looked at the abscesses and was afraid to perform the surgery, fearing that Xu Guochen could not bear the pain. But Xu Guochen extended his left hand, turned his head to the right, and said to the doctor, "Cut it! If you heal me, I can return to my post sooner and seek revenge." A large, bright red abscess was cut away, and unbearable pain pierced his entire body. He gritted his teeth, knowing that this was the pain inflicted on him by the American aggressors. When he saw the letters of condolence flying in from all over the country like snowflakes, it further strengthened his will to fight against American imperialism. His fellow workers chopped firewood, bought rice, swept the floor, and carried water for his family, taking care of his children as if they were their own. They also sent representatives to comfort him: "Take good care of yourself and don't worry about your family. We will work doubly hard to avenge you!"
    "Blood debts must be repaid with blood!" Hundreds of letters of condolence expressed the determination of thousands upon thousands of Chinese people to resist American aggression. A letter sent to Xu Guochen from the Peking University Affiliated Hospital included a principle manual on hand treatment. The letter was written by an orthopedic doctor named Chen Jingyun, who wrote enthusiastically in the letter: "I heard that your left hand was broken by American planes. I am very angry. I am willing to treat you and turn your left hand into a good hand, able to do all kinds of work and avenge you!" After writing this letter, Dr. Chen also published an article in a Northeast newspaper, hoping to treat Xu Guochen's hand. Xu Guochen accepted his kindness and came to Beijing on October 29th, meeting Dr. Chen. The elderly, bald Dr. Chen grasped his hand tightly and did not let go for a long time, saying repeatedly, "You have suffered too much, but you are glorious. I must heal your hand." Xu Guochen's disabled left hand could be healed around November 20th. He said, "When I return to Linjiang, I will definitely work even harder than before and, together with the people of the whole country, resist America, aid Korea, and demand the repayment of this blood debt!"
    In a building, Xu Guochen took out his photo of the wounded area, and told me: The scene of the American imperialist aircraft strafing Linjiang Station has been published in the Northeast Pictorial, this is a blood debt that the Chinese people cannot forget. The American imperialists' crazed atrocities cannot scare the Chinese people, and the Chinese people have the strength and determination to repel American aggression. Xu Guochen said that the "No. 928" locomotive, which was shot and damaged by American imperialist aircraft, has been repaired by his fellow workers and is now continuing to run on the people's railway, working hard for resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting the family, and defending the country. "No. 928" locomotive after being harmed, should have been sent to a large factory for repair. But the workers of the Tonghua Locomotive Depot asked to repair it themselves, to express their determination to take revenge and the endless power to repel American imperialist aggression. During the repair process, the workers found materials themselves, thought of ways to overcome all difficulties. They automatically extended working hours, forgot their fatigue, forgot to eat, and worked on the scene day and night. They originally planned to repair it within ten days, but to celebrate the first National Day of the People's Republic of China, it was completed in seven days. According to the equipment capacity of the Locomotive Depot, it was impossible to repair the "No. 928" locomotive which suffered the degree of damage equal to a medium repair; but it was quickly repaired under the workers' high patriotic spirit. Xu Guochen said: "This is the strength of our workers." On the glorious and brilliant October 1st, "No. 928" locomotive carried thousands of people, heading towards Linjiang Station, which was strafed by the American imperialist aircraft, to demonstrate to the American aggressors. At that time, Xu Guochen spoke to the demonstrating masses with his injuries, and he shouted in a loud voice: "The four hundred and seventy-five million Chinese people have stood up and will never allow American mad dogs to invade our territory. Let us pick up hammers and kill the American mad dogs who dare to break into our country!" Xu Guochen's voice expressed the strong will of the Chinese people to resist aggression.
    While Xu Guochen was treating his hand in Beijing, he was spreading the American imperialists' ambition of aggression everywhere. He knew that the American mad dogs who strafed him were still slaughtering the Korean people, threatening the safety of the motherland, he was so angry that he could not restrain himself from opening his arms and shouting to the railway workers in Beijing: "Concentrate all our strength to fight to drive away the American bandits." When I went to visit him, he was reading the newspaper, and he said that he hoped to heal his hand quickly, return to the Northeast as soon as possible, and participate in the work of resisting America and aiding Korea.

　　控诉美机暴行
    ——访临江车站受伤司机徐国臣
    本报记者  陈迹
    “美机打断了我的左手，我还可以用右手来报仇！”临江机务段司机徐国臣把负伤的左手从上衣的口袋里伸出来，斩钉截铁地敲着桌子，愤怒地控诉美国飞机扫射临江车站，侵犯我国领土主权的暴行。他的左手只剩了一只大拇指，手掌上的皮肤翻长在手背上，好像是一个带疤的肉瘤。这是美国侵略者血债的标记，必须永远记在每一个中国人的心里：血债是要用血来偿还的。
    八月二十七日上午十一时左右，徐国臣在临江机务段和几个工友在煤台上安静地给一台机车上煤，忽然四架飞机从他们的上空俯冲下来，当看清楚是涂着白色五星标志的美国飞机时，徐国臣突然想起停放在轨道上的三台机车有被炸毁的危险，他便迅速地跳下煤台，去抢救机车。这时美机的机枪疯狂地朝着他扫射，机枪子弹从他身前掠过，他冒着弹雨，一口气跑上“九二八号”机车，勇敢地开动汽门，企图把机车开出临江车站。当机车走了二十多公尺远的地方，他发现前面的道岔没有搬开，再把机车向前开，就会出事故，他机警地停下了车，连忙从机车上跑下来，爬到机车下面。疯狂的美帝飞机在距离机车几百公尺高的上空，继续扫射着“九二八号”机车，一颗子弹落在徐国臣的面前，打中了他的左手，四个手指头全被打烂了，鲜血迸射出来。徐国臣用右手紧握着血淋淋的左手，把身子向后移动。忍着疼痛心里想：“打死了我，全国人民会替我报仇；打不死我，我要讨回这笔血债。”美机仍在扫射，机车汽缸也被打破了，喷射出热腾腾的汽水，徐国臣从机车底下，咬紧牙根地站出来，一颗子弹又从他的头边飞过，他沉着地跑向运转室去，找人抢救被弹火燃烧的机车。工友们看见他的左手流着血，脸孔涂满了泥灰和砂子，就紧忙过来给他包扎伤口，但他说：“你们快去救机车！”美帝飞机在临江车站扫射了十多分钟，才向东南逸去。“九二八号”机车共伤一百零二处，被子弹射穿七十八个孔，水表也被打坏了一个，损坏的程度等于一个中修。
    徐国臣被工友们送到通化市铁路医院，住了几天，他的伤口发炎了，左手膀全都肿了起来，必须得用刀割掉伤口的脓包。大夫看着脓包，不敢动手术，害怕徐国臣受不住痛。但徐国臣伸出了他的左手，把头向右一转，对大夫说：“割吧！医好了，能够早些回到工作岗位上去报仇。”一大块鲜红的脓包割下来了，难以忍受的疼痛刺着他的全身，他咬紧牙关，知道这是美国侵略者给他的痛苦。当他看到从全国各地如雪片飞来的慰问信的时候，更加坚定了他对美帝斗争的意志。工友们替他家里打柴买米，扫地挑水，照顾他的孩子如同自己儿子一样，并且还派代表来安慰他：“你好好休养，不要记挂家庭，我们要用加倍的工作，为你报仇！”
    “血债要用血来偿还！”上百封的慰问信表示着千千万万中国人民抵抗美国侵略的决心。一封从北京大学附属医院寄给徐国臣的信，里面附着一份治手的原理书，写信的是一个骨科大夫，名叫陈景云，他在信里热忱地写着：“我听说你的左手被美机打断了，我非常愤怒，我愿意替你医治，让你的左手变成一个好手，能做一切工作，替你复仇！”陈大夫写了这封信，还在东北的报纸上登载了一篇文章，希望能给徐国臣医手。徐国臣接受了他的盛情，在十月二十九日来到北京，见着了陈大夫，年老的秃发的陈大夫紧握着他的手，很久时间才放下，连连说：“你太苦痛了，但你是光荣的，我一定要治好你的手。”徐国臣残废的左手在十一月二十日左右就可以治好。他说：“我回临江去，一定要比以往更加倍地工作，和全国人民一道，抗美援朝，讨还血债！”
    在一座楼房里，徐国臣拿出他受伤的照片，并且告诉我：美帝飞机扫射临江车站的情景，都已刊登在东北画报上了，这是中国人民不能忘记的血债。美帝的疯狂暴行吓不住中国人民，中国人民有力量和决心击退美帝的侵略。徐国臣说，被美帝飞机射伤的“九二八号”机车已由工友们修复了，现在继续骋驰在人民铁路上，为抗美援朝保家卫国而努力工作。“九二八号”机车受害之后，是应该送进大厂修理的。但是通化机务段工友纷纷要求自己修理，以表示他们复仇的决心和击退美帝侵略的无尽力量。在修理的过程中，工友们自己找材料，想办法，克服一切困难。他们自动延长工作时间，忘记了疲劳，忘记了吃饭，不分昼夜地在现场工作。他们本来预计十天内修复，但为了庆祝中华人民共和国第一个国庆日，竟以七天时间修成。按照机务段的设备能力，是不能修理损伤到相当中修程度的“九二八号”机车的；但在工友们高度的爱国主义精神下却迅速地修好了。徐国臣说：“这就是我们工人的力量。”在光辉灿烂的十月一日，“九二八号”机车载着几千群众，驶向被美帝飞机扫射的临江车站，向美国侵略者示威。那时，徐国臣带伤向示威群众讲话，他以响亮的声音喊道：“四万七千五百万中国人民已经站立起来了，决不容许美国疯狗来侵犯我们的国土，让我们拿起铁锤，来打死敢于闯进我们国土的美国疯狗吧！”徐国臣的声音表达了中国人民坚强地反抗侵略的意志。
    徐国臣在北京治手的时候，到处宣传着美帝侵略的野心，他知道扫射他的美国疯狗还在屠杀着朝鲜人民，威胁着祖国的安全，他怒不可遏止地伸开两臂，向着北京铁路职工高呼：“集中一切力量，为赶走美国强盗而斗争。”在我去访问他的时候，他正在看着报纸，他说，他希望赶快把手治好，早日回东北，参加抗美援朝的工作。
