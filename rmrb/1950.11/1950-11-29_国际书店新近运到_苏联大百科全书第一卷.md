The first volume of the Russian-language "Great Soviet Encyclopedia," published in Moscow, has arrived in Beijing and is being exclusively distributed by the International Bookstore. The "Great Soviet Encyclopedia" began publication in 1926 and played a significant role in summarizing the knowledge achievements of the Soviet people. However, due to the passage of time, much of the material became outdated or even contained errors, hence the new edition (i.e., the current second edition). The new edition of the "Great Soviet Encyclopedia" is being published according to a decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers. According to the decision, "The second edition of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia should be a systematic codification of knowledge in the fields of society, economics, natural sciences, technology, and military affairs, and a comprehensive reference book for the broad Soviet intelligentsia." The task of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia is to fully reflect the unprecedented rise of Soviet culture in the Stalin era, the modern high level of Soviet science and technology, and to record the enormous changes in the lives of the Soviet people. The new edition of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia is planned to be published in fifty volumes, with 300,000 copies printed per volume. The entire encyclopedia will be completed in six years—that is, by 1956. The book is arranged in Russian alphabetical order, and the first volume includes entries starting with the letter A (632 pages in total).
