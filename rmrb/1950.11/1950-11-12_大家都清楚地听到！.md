　　Everyone Clearly Hears!
    By Sakai Tokuzo, Translated by Liu Yongxin

    Editor's Note: During the war, 416 of our captured soldiers were murdered by Japanese fascists at the Hanaoka mine in Akita Prefecture, and their remains are still scattered in the valleys. Recently, overseas Chinese in Japan went to collect and cremate the remains, and a memorial service is scheduled to be held at the Honganji Temple in Tokyo on November 1 this year. Upon hearing this news, the Japanese people's poet, Mr. Sakai Tokuzo, composed this poem on his sickbed to commemorate the heroic spirits of the martyrs. This poem is a sublime expression of the internationalist spirit of the patriotic Japanese people, and it is especially valuable today, when the United States is actively invading Korea and arming the reactionary forces in Japan, and our people have righteously launched the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect our homeland, as we can no longer tolerate it. It represents the true will of the Japanese people, and it helps us strengthen our belief that the world peace camp will surely win.

    Everyone clearly understands,
    Everyone clearly hears
    You,
      The cries of scattered white bones,
    Are now
      Piercing our chests and hearts!
    From Hanaoka, from Kiso Valley,
    From Tokyo and Hokkaido,
    And even from
      Riverbanks and mines all over Japan,
    Comes forth
      The hateful cry of your white bones…
    The ringleader of the germ warfare plot,
      On the island where white bones are scattered,
      Is living happily!
    The prime minister of the separate peace,
      Wants to use white bones to further consolidate
      The Japanese archipelago of white bones!
    But we, the Japanese people,
      Want to give you, the glorious ones,
      A solemn burial and memorial service,
    All of you--
      Heroes who died for the
      People's Republic of China!
    We will use the power of democracy, independence, and peace,
    To thoroughly investigate the war criminals and never forgive!
    Otherwise,
      Our entire nation
    Will become
      Hiroshima covered in white bones!
    Everyone clearly hears,
    Everyone clearly understands,
    You--
      Heroes who fought to the end with fists and feet!
    You--
      The cries of the glorious soldiers of the People's Republic!

　　大家都清楚地听到！
    坂井德三作　刘永鑫译
    编者按：战时，我国被俘战士四百十六名，被日本法西斯杀害在秋田县花冈矿山，迄今遗骨散弃于山谷之间。最近在日华侨，前往收殓火葬，定于本年十一月一日，在东京本愿寺开吊追悼。日本人民诗人坂井德三先生闻讯，在病榻上草成此诗，以祭殉难英灵。这首诗是日本爱国人民的国际主义精神的崇高表现，在美帝积极侵略朝鲜和武装日本反动势力，而我国人民忍无可忍地爆发了抗美援朝保家卫国的正义运动的今天，是尤其可贵的。它代表日本人民的真正意志，它帮助我们加强世界和平阵营必将胜利的信念。
    大家都清晰地明了，
    大家都清楚地听到
    你们
      被弃四散的白骨的喊叫，
    现在正
      刺入了我们的胸头和心梢！
    从花冈，从木曾谷，
    从东京和北海道，
    更从
      遍日本的河堤和矿山，
    发出来的
      你们白骨的痛恨的喊叫………
    细菌战争阴谋的头目，
      在白骨散乱的岛上
      幸福逍遥！
    单独讲和的首相，
      想用白骨来更巩固
      白骨的日本列岛！
    然而我们日本人民，
      却想对光荣的你们
      厚葬追悼，
    你们诸位——
      为了中华人民共和国的
      殉难英豪！
    我们用民主、独立、和平的力量，
    彻底追究战犯不饶！
    否则，
      我们的整个民族，
    都会成为
      白骨满布的广岛！
    大家都清楚地听到，
    大家都清晰地明了，
    你们——
      用拳脚战斗到底的英豪！
    你们——
      人民共和国光荣战士的喊叫！
