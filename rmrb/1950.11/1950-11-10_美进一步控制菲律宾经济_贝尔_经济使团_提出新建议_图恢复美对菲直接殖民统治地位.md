　　US Further Tightens Control Over Philippine Economy
    Bell "Economic Mission" Proposes New Recommendations
    Aims to Restore Direct US Colonial Rule Over the Philippines
    Xinhua News Agency, 4th -- According to the United States Information Service in Washington: The United States and the Philippine puppet government of Quirino simultaneously released a report on October 28th on a so-called "Plan to Strengthen the Economy of the Republic of the Philippines." This plan was proposed by the "Economic Mission" led by former US Undersecretary of the Treasury Bell, who went to the Philippines in July to "investigate all aspects of the Philippine economy." The purpose of the Bell report is to shirk responsibility for the deterioration of the Philippine economic situation caused by US colonial exploitation and to create a basis for the United States to further control the economic life of the Philippines.

    The Bell report begins with a lengthy admission that under the oppression and exploitation of US colonial rule, the Philippine "economic situation has deteriorated in the past two years." The output of Philippine agriculture and industry is still below pre-war levels, and the living standards of the people are lower than before the war. The wages of many agricultural workers are completely insufficient to maintain a living. The Philippine government is also facing a "financial crisis." The national treasury has a large deficit and is "growing daily." Tax revenues are only sufficient to cover slightly more than 60 percent of expenditures. Prices have risen to an average of three and a half times pre-war levels. The credit of the currency "has been shaken."

    The Bell report then complains that "inefficiency and even corruption are widespread in government agencies" under Quirino, leading to a "lack of trust in the government's ability" among the people, with a sense of disillusionment pervading everywhere. After placing the blame for the deteriorating Philippine economy entirely on the Quirino puppet government, Bell concludes that "the long-term solution to these problems lies only in American aid and encouragement," in establishing a "treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation" with the United States, and in "removing obstacles to hiring foreign technical personnel," etc. In order to achieve the goal of restoring direct US colonial rule over the Philippines, the report recommends that the United States grant and loan the Philippine government $250 million for "economic development and assistance" over five years. However, the report goes on to emphasize that this sum is "strictly limited to the steps taken by the Philippine government to implement the above recommendations" and that a US "technical mission" will be sent to supervise and control the expenditure of these funds.

    Commenting on the "Bell Economic Mission" report, the New York Daily Worker of October 30th stated that Bell's recommendations are "a recommendation for the US government to openly take over the work of exploiting the Philippines for Wall Street," and that the conditions of US financial assistance will ensure that the State Department can completely control the shaky, corrupt Quirino regime.

　　美进一步控制菲律宾经济
    贝尔“经济使团”提出新建议
    图恢复美对菲直接殖民统治地位
    【新华社四日讯】据美国新闻处华盛顿讯：美国与菲律宾季里诺傀儡政府，于十月二十八日同时发表了一项所谓“加强菲律宾共和国经济计划”的报告。该计划是由七月间赴菲律宾的美国前财政部次长贝尔所率领的“经济使团”，在“调查菲国经济各方面”后所提出的。贝尔报告的目的在于推卸由于美国殖民地剥削所引起的菲律宾经济情况恶化的责任，并为美国进一步地控制菲律宾的经济生活，创造根据。
    贝尔的报告首先以冗长的篇幅承认，在美国殖民地统治压榨之下的菲律宾，“过去两年来经济情况已经恶化”。菲律宾的农业与工业的出产仍低于战前水平，人民的生活水平均较战前为低。很多农业工人的工资完全不够维持生活。菲律宾政府在财政方面也“已经发生危机”。国库亏空很大，并在“日渐增长”。赋税的收入仅足偿付支出的百分之六十强。物价平均高涨到战前的三倍半。货币的信用“已经动摇”。
    贝尔报告继而埋怨季里诺“政府机关中的没有效率甚至腐化现象普遍存在”，以致“民众对于政府的能力缺乏信任”，到处弥漫着幻灭的感觉。贝尔把菲律宾经济恶化的责任完全推到季里诺傀儡政府身上后，得出结论：“对于这些问题的长期解决办法，只有借美国的援助与鼓励”，与美国订立“友好通商与航运的条约”，“废除雇佣外国技术人员的障碍”等等。该报告为了达到恢复美国对菲律宾直接的殖民地统治的目的，建议美国以赠与和贷款的方式给予菲律宾政府二亿五千万美元，作为五年内“经济开发与援助”之用。但该报告接着强调这笔款项“严格限于菲律宾政府为实行上述建议所采取的步骤”上，并由美国派一个“技术使团”监督和管制这笔款项的开支。
    十月三十日的纽约《工人日报》在评论“贝尔经济使团”的报告时，认为贝尔的建议是使“美国政府公开地替华尔街接管剥削菲律宾的工作的建议”，美国财政援助的条件，将保证国务院可以完全控制摇摇欲坠的季里诺腐败政权。
