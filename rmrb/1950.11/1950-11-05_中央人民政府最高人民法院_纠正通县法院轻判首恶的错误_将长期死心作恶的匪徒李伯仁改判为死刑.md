Central People's Government Supreme People's Court
	Corrects Tongxian Court's Error in Lightly Sentencing the Principal Culprit
	Reversing the Sentence of the Long-Term Die-Hard Criminal Li Boren to Death

[Our Newspaper's Report] On August 14th, the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government formally announced the correction of the error made by the Tongxian Branch of the Hebei Provincial People's Court in lightly sentencing the principal culprit of counter-revolution, and decided to sentence the bandit Li Boren to death. The handling process of the case is reported as follows.

(1) Case Introduction

The bandit Li Boren was from Jixian County, Hebei Province, with a landlord background. After graduating from the pseudo-Beijing Higher Police Academy in 1942, he directly participated in counter-revolutionary activities. In the spring of 1944, when Li was the chief of the 5th branch of the pseudo-Baodi Police Bureau, he brought along special agents to kill and arrest one of our cadres in Zhangzhuangzi. In June of the same year, he also cooperated with the pseudo-Baodi Garrison to attack our staff in Guojiashenzi, killing one person. In August, when he was the inspector of Baodi County, he led pseudo-police to plunder the people's market in Bajianfang, west of the city. In the winter of 1946, Li served as chief clerk of the military section, chief of the judicial section, member of the joint secretariat, chief judge of the joint court, instructor of the repair shop, instructor of the "repentance院", and leader of the intelligence team in the Chiang bandit's Jixian County, and his massacre of the people became even more brutal. At that time, Li offered a plan to the pseudo-county head to establish a "Repentance院" to poison young people. A young man surnamed Wang, who made progressive remarks in the hospital, was secretly executed by them. When Li served as the chief judge of the joint court of the pseudo-Jixian County Party, government, military, and league, he directly became a vicious supporter of the landlord and the "Homecoming Corps" in carrying out counter-revolutionary restoration, sentencing more than ten of our village cadres, including Zheng Yu, to death. In the spring of 1947, according to his special agent's intelligence, Li colluded with the pseudo-county head and others to encircle and suppress our staff stationed in Bagou Village, killing our district head Zhao Kuodong, the county women's committee member Cui Yan, and more than ten others on the spot, and arresting five or six of our cadres, and interrogating and executing two of them. Later, he organized a surprise attack to encircle Zhangjiazhuang in the fifth district, killing five of our village cadres, arresting ten, and shooting two of them. In April of the same year, when the bandit army retreated hastily from Jixian County, Li submitted more than 40 of our cadres detained in the prison to the pseudo-167th regiment, all of whom were stabbed to death with bayonets. In March 1948, when Li was the lieutenant adjutant and captain secretary of the pseudo-security regiment and concurrently worked as a staff member of the military police inspection office (stationed in Shixia Town), he planned to attack Qinggongtai Village east of Xianghe City, killing five or six of our militiamen, arresting nine, and shooting four of them on the way, taking five away, and later interrogating and executing two of them. In May of the same year, Li planned two ambushes in Xuanjiaosi, east of Xianghe City, in which two of our militiamen were killed and one was wounded and captured.

In addition to repeatedly instigating or conspiring to kill more than 100 of our cadres, militiamen, and masses, Li often sent personnel to carry out terrorist means to disrupt the liberated areas, torture our cadres and people to extract confessions, extort and plunder, and sell drugs. The people of Jixian County hated Li to the bone. After the liberation of Shixia, Li fled to Beijing. In April 1949, he was captured by our public security personnel, and two long and short military knives and 63 bullets were found in his home. He was immediately handed over to the Beijing People's Court and then transferred to the Jixian Judicial Office for handling. In September 1949, Li instigated prisoners in prison in an attempt to escape, which was discovered by us in advance.

(2) Trial Process

1. The First Instance Sentenced Li to Death

Li's confession and repentance statement made at the Jixian People's Government Judicial Office admitted the above-mentioned criminal facts, and the victims Wang Wanxun, Deng Wenjia, and his former subordinate Zhang Yun also testified that they were true. The Jixian People's Government Judicial Office, considering Li to be a thoroughly stubborn and incorrigible counter-revolutionary principal element, sentenced Li to death in February of this year. Li refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Tongxian Special District Branch of the Hebei Provincial People's Court.

2. The Second Instance Changed Li's Sentence to Fifteen Years in Prison

Li excused his actions while serving in the pseudo-position as being forced to follow, and argued that he had rescued our staff, requesting lenient treatment from the Tongxian Special District Branch. The Tongxian Special District Branch did not analyze or investigate whether the circumstances and reasons stated by him were true, and believed: "All his criminal behaviors are crimes of duty. Apart from this, direct and active crimes are not serious. Moreover, the final decision-making power for all crimes is in the hands of the pseudo-county head and pseudo-military officers." "Therefore, in sentencing, we should give lenient treatment in the spirit of leniency." The sentence of Li was changed to fifteen years in prison.

3. The Supreme People's Court Revokes the Second Instance Judgment and Maintains the First Instance Judgment of the Death Penalty for Li

The Public Security Bureau of the Jixian People's Government, dissatisfied with the second instance judgment, appealed to the Supreme People's Court. The Supreme People's Court reviewed the original files, and from the first instance and the investigation materials of the Jixian Public Security Bureau and Li's confessions of his criminal facts in the first and second instances, as well as the testimonies of the victims Wang Wanxun, Deng Wenjia, and Li's subordinate Zhang Yun, it was determined that the facts of Li's crimes were conclusive. Regarding Li's second instance's claim that his actions were forced to follow, the Supreme People's Court believed that Li held military, political, and intelligence power in Jixian, and colluded with the pseudo-county head and pseudo-military officers. The Bagou, Zhangjiazhuang, Qinggongtai, and other incidents were all personally planned and launched by Li, and were by no means acting on the orders of others, let alone being forced to follow. He was indeed one of the leading counter-revolutionaries in Jixian, and should bear the primary responsibility for the bloody massacres in the aforementioned locations. As for Li's claim that he had saved our staff members Ding Kechang and purchasing agent Xia Minzhai, the Supreme People's Court has investigated and clarified the matter. Li and Ding Kechang were neighbors, and Ding Kechang was a scoundrel who pretended to be our staff member and cheated everywhere, and is now being detained by the Beijing Public Security Bureau for investigation; regarding the rescue of Xia Minzhai, it has also been proved by the witness Zhao Fengsheng that Zhao and Xia were fellow villagers and cousins of Li, and when Xia was arrested, Zhao asked Li to find a way to release him because of his friendship with his fellow villager; it was by no means Li's intention to abandon counter-revolutionary activities and approach the people. Therefore, it cannot reduce his crime against the people.

Since becoming an enemy eagle claw in 1942, Li has been engaged in corruption, drug trafficking, bullying the masses, killing our revolutionary cadres, and disrupting our revolutionary order; after the liberation of Jixian, he returned to Shixia and resisted stubbornly, continuing to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. After the liberation of Shixia, he still did not repent, bow his head to the people, but fled to Beijing, trying to escape the punishment of the people; after being arrested, he organized prisoners to plot an escape. These consistent crimes can prove that he has always been a die-hard counter-revolutionary chief culprit, with no possibility of transformation and education. According to Article 7 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the instructions on suppressing counter-revolutionary activities jointly issued by the Supreme People's Court and the Government Administration Council on July 23 this year, severe punishment should be given. However, the Tongxian Special District Branch did not conduct in-depth investigation and analysis, and was deceived by the sweet words of counter-revolutionary criminals, mistakenly believing that the counter-revolutionary activities Li was engaged in were "crimes of duty," and did not understand that counter-revolutionary duty and counter-revolutionary crimes are not contradictory. Li killed more than 100 of our cadres and masses. This kind of crime was carried out by taking advantage of his counter-revolutionary duties. Li's duties and crimes can only prove that he is a veritable and resolute counter-revolutionary chief culprit. The second instance did not analyze, but regarded a counter-revolutionary criminal who has consistently been an enemy of the people for the past eight or nine years as merely "crimes of duty," and the so-called "the final decision-making power for all crimes is in the hands of the pseudo-county head and pseudo-military officers," and reduced his guilt and changed his sentence to fifteen years in prison. This kind of unprincipled leniency is very inappropriate. The Jixian People's Government Public Security Bureau, in order to consolidate the revolutionary order and safeguard the democratic rights of the people, requested to sentence Li to death on behalf of the people of Jixian, which is completely correct. For this reason, the Supreme People's Court revoked the second instance judgment and upheld the first instance judgment of the Jixian Judicial Office to sentence Li Boren to death.

　　中央人民政府最高人民法院
    纠正通县法院轻判首恶的错误
    将长期死心作恶的匪徒李伯仁改判为死刑
    【本报讯】中央人民政府最高人民法院于八月十四日正式宣布纠正河北省人民法院通县分院轻判反革命首恶分子的错误，决定将李匪伯仁判处死刑。兹将该案处理经过报道如次。
    （一）案情介绍
    李匪伯仁系河北蓟县人，地主成份。一九四二年自伪北京高等警官学校毕业后，即直接参加反革命活动。一九四四年春，李犯任伪宝坻警察局第五分局长时，曾带同特务在张庄子杀害与逮捕我方干部各一人。同年六月又配合伪宝坻警备队，袭击我郭家申子工作人员，打死群众一人。八月任宝坻县督察长时，曾率伪警抢扰城西八间房的人民市场。一九四六年冬，李犯充任蒋匪蓟县军事科主任科员、司法股长、联秘处组员、联席法庭首席法官、修械所指导员、“反省院”指导员和情报组长等伪职，屠杀人民愈益凶残。当时李犯向伪县长献计成立“反省院”以毒害青年。该院有一王姓青年，在院内发表进步言论，被他们秘密处死。当李犯任伪蓟县党政军团联席法庭首席法官时，更直接成为地主和“还乡团”进行反革命复辟的凶恶的支持者，将我村干郑虞等十余人判处死刑。一九四七年春，李犯根据他的特务情报，与伪县长等合谋围剿我驻八沟村的工作人员，当场击毙我区长赵扩东，县妇委崔彦等十余人，逮捕我干部五、六人，并将其中二人审讯处死。后来又组织突袭包围五区张家庄，打死我村干部五人，逮捕十人，并将其中二人枪杀。同年四月，匪军由蓟县仓皇撤退时，李将狱中所扣押的我方干部四十余人，提交伪一六七团，全部用刺刀挑死。一九四八年三月，李犯任伪保安团中尉副官，上尉书记官兼军警稽查处干事时（驻石匣镇），又策划袭击香河城东庆公台村，击毙我民兵五、六人，逮捕九人，在途中枪杀四人，带去五人，后又将其中二人审讯处死。同年五月，李犯又策划香河城东宣教寺两次埋伏，前后被其击毙我民兵二人，伤俘各一人。
    李犯的罪恶，除多次主使或合谋杀害我干部、民兵及群众百余名外，并时常派员施行恐怖手段扰乱解放区，对我干部与人民酷刑逼供，敲诈掠夺，贩卖毒品等罪行不可胜数。蓟县人民对李犯痛恨入骨。石匣解放后，李匪潜逃至北京。一九四九年四月被我公安人员捕获，并于其家中搜出长短军刀各一把，子弹六十三粒，当即解交北京市人民法院，又由北京市人民法院移送到蓟县司法处处理。一九四九年九月间，李犯在监狱中煽动犯人，企图逃跑，经我事先发觉未成。
    （二）审理经过
    一、一审判处李犯死刑
    李犯在蓟县人民政府司法处所作的供词与反省书，对其上述犯罪事实，均已承认，又有被害人王万勋、邓文甲和他的旧部属张云指证属实。蓟县人民政府司法处以李犯是一个十足顽恶不堪教育改造的反革命首要分子，于今年二月间将李犯判处死刑。李犯不服，向河北省人民法院通县专区分院提起上诉。
    二、二审改判李犯徒刑十五年
    李犯借口任伪职时的行动，是被迫胁从，并以营救过我工作人员做辩解，要求通县专区分院宽大处理。通县专区分院对其所陈述的情形与理由是否属实，未加以分析调查，竟认为：“其所有之罪恶行为均系职务上的犯罪。除此之外，直接主动的罪行尚不严重。且一切罪行的最后决定权，均操于伪县长伪军官之手。”“因此在量刑时，应本宽大之精神，予以从轻处理。”而改判李犯徒刑十五年。
    三、最高人民法院撤销第二审判决，维持第一审对李犯处以死刑的判决
    蓟县人民政府公安局，不服第二审判决，向最高人民法院提起上诉。最高人民法院核阅原卷，从第一审与蓟县公安局调查材料与李犯对其犯罪事实在一、二两审的历次供认，以及被害人王万勋、邓文甲和李犯部属张云等的指证，认定李犯的罪行事实确凿。对李犯在第二审诡称其行动是被迫胁从一节，最高人民法院认为李犯在蓟县身集军、政、谍报等大权，和伪县长伪军官狼狈为奸。八沟、张家庄、庆公台等事件，都是由李犯亲自策划发动，绝不是听命于他人，更不是被迫胁从，而确是蓟县反动首恶之一，对上述地点的血腥屠杀，自应负主要责任。至于李犯诡称救过我工作人员丁克昌，采买员夏敏斋一节，已经最高人民法院调查清楚。李犯与丁克昌是邻谊，而丁克昌是一个冒充我公务人员到处招摇撞骗的坏蛋，现已被北京市公安局羁押追究中；关于营救夏敏斋，也已由证人赵奉生证明：赵与夏是同乡而与李犯是表兄弟关系，在夏被捕时，赵因同乡之谊，托情央求李犯设法释放；绝非是李犯有放弃反革命活动，靠近人民的意图。因此就不能减轻他反人民的罪责。
    李犯自一九四二年为敌鹰爪以来，贪污贩毒，欺压群众，杀戮我革命干部，破坏我革命秩序；蓟县解放后，又复退驻石匣，恃强顽抗，继续进行反革命活动。石匣解放后，仍不悔悟，向人民低头，犹潜逃北京，企图逃避人民的惩办；获案后又组织犯人阴谋越狱。这一贯的罪行，可以证明他始终是一个死心塌地的反革命首恶分子，没有改造教育的可能。根据人民政治协商会议共同纲领第七条规定，以及今年七月二十三日最高人民法院和政务院会衔发布的关于镇压反革命活动的指示，应该给予严厉的惩罚。而通县专区分院未作深入调查与分析研究，被反革命罪犯的花言巧语所蒙蔽，把李犯所从事的反革命活动，错认为是“职务上的犯罪”，不了解反革命职务和反革命罪行并不是什么矛盾的东西。李犯杀害我方干部和群众一百多人。这种罪行，正是利用他的反革命职务进行的。李犯的职务和罪行，只能证明他是一个名符其实的，坚决的反革命首恶分子。第二审不加分析，把一个八、九年来一贯和人民为敌的反革命凶犯，认为只是“职务上的犯罪”，和所谓“一切罪行的最后决定权，均操于伪县长伪军官之手”，而减轻其罪责改判徒刑十五年，这种缺乏原则性的宽大处理是很不恰当的。蓟县人民政府公安局，为了巩固革命秩序，保障人民民主权利，代表蓟县人民要求判李犯死刑，是完全正确的。为此最高人民法院将第二审判决撤销，维持蓟县司法处判处李犯伯仁死刑的第一审判决。
