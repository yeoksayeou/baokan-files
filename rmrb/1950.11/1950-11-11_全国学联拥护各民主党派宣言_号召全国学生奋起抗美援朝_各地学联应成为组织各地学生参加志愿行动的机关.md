Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The All-China Students' Federation recently issued a declaration endorsing the joint declaration of the democratic parties. The full text is as follows:

　　The joint declaration issued by the Chinese Communist Party and the democratic parties correctly reflects the just demands of the people of the whole country. It supports the people of the whole country in striving, on a voluntary basis, for the sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country. It is the current program of action for the people of the whole country. The All-China Students' Federation, representing the students of all of China, expresses its resolute support for this just declaration and calls on students nationwide to unite and actively launch the great patriotic movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country.

　　Chinese students, together with the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have sacrificed blood and lives for thirty years, struggled arduously, and victoriously established their own country, have their own government, and under the sunshine of Mao Zedong, have begun to live a free and happy learning life. Facing the grand prospects of our country's great economic and cultural construction, facing the bright future of our young people, we are learning enthusiastically and diligently. We are in urgent need of peace and construction!

　　However, the American aggressors will not let us live a peaceful life. They will not let us carry out construction work. The American aggressors have ignited the flames of aggression at the gate of our great motherland; the American fleet has invaded our country's Taiwan territorial waters. The American army is approaching our northeastern border. The American aggressors are following the old path taken by Japanese imperialism, invading our neighbor Korea, invading our motherland, in order to rule Asia and enslave the whole world!

　　The blade of the American aggressors has already pointed at the peace-loving Chinese people. Every patriotic Chinese student is filled with hot blood and can no longer tolerate it! In order to defend the sacred borders of our great and beloved motherland, in order to guarantee our peaceful learning life after liberation, in order to aid the just and heroic Korean people of our close neighbor, Chinese students will prepare to contribute all their strength and, together with the people of the whole country, struggle to smash the arrogant aggression of American imperialism.

　　We call on all students in China to actively launch this great patriotic movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country. Local student federations should become organs for organizing local students to participate in volunteer action. All students remaining at school should widely launch the study of current events, deepen their understanding of the aggressive nature of American imperialism, conduct propaganda, and intensify their studies and physical exercise, preparing to respond to the call of the All-China Students' Federation at any time.

　　We firmly believe that Chinese students, who have a glorious patriotic and anti-imperialist tradition and have been tested and grown up in this struggle, will write a glorious heroic poem with their own efforts in today's great patriotic movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country.

　　Victory will surely belong to the just Chinese people, the Korean people, and the peace-loving people of the world! And the American aggressors will suffer the final defeat like the Japanese aggressors!

　　全国学联拥护各民主党派宣言
　　号召全国学生奋起抗美援朝     
    各地学联应成为组织各地学生参加志愿行动的机关
    【新华社九日讯】中华全国学生联合会顷发表宣言，拥护各民主党派联合宣言，全文如下：
    中国共产党和各民主党派所发表的联合宣言，正确地反映了全国人民的正义要求。它支持全国人民在志愿基础上为着抗美援朝保家卫国的神圣任务而奋斗。它是全国人民当前的行动纲领。中华全国学生联合会代表全中国的学生对这一正义的宣言表示坚决的拥护，并号召全国学生，一致起来，积极开展抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大爱国运动。
    中国学生和中国人民一道，在中国共产党领导之下，三十年来流血牺牲，艰苦奋斗，胜利地建立了自己的国家，有了自己的政府，在毛泽东的阳光底下，开始过着自由幸福的学习生活。面向着我们祖国伟大规模的经济文化建设的远景，面向着我们青年人的美好将来，我们热情地、努力地学习着。我们是迫切地需要和平，需要建设！
    然而，美国侵略者不让我们过和平生活。不让我们进行建设工作。美国侵略者在我们伟大的祖国门前点燃了侵略战火；美国舰队侵入我国台湾领海。美国陆军逼近我国东北边境。美国侵略者正沿着日本帝国主义所走的旧路，侵略我们邻人朝鲜，侵略我们祖国，以便统治亚洲，奴役全世界！
    美国侵略者的刀锋，已经指向了爱好和平的中国人民。每一个热爱祖国的中国学生，已是热血满腔，忍无可忍！为了保卫自己伟大的亲爱的祖国的神圣边疆，为了保障自己解放后的和平学习生活，为了援助正义的英勇的我们亲密邻邦的朝鲜人民，中国学生将准备付出一切力量，和全国人民一道，为粉碎美国帝国主义的狂妄侵略而奋斗。
    我们号召全中国的学生，积极开展这一抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大爱国运动。各地学生联合会应当成为组织各地学生参加志愿行动的机关。全体留校学习的同学，应当广泛展开对目前时事的学习，加深对美帝国主义侵略本质的认识，进行宣传，并加紧学习，锻炼身体，准备随时响应全国学联的召唤。
    我们深信：有着光荣的爱国的反帝传统、并在这斗争中久经考验而成长起来的中国学生，在今天抗美援朝保家卫国的伟大爱国运动当中，将用自己的努力写下光辉的英雄诗篇。
    胜利定将属于正义的中国人民，朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平的人民！而美国侵略者定将像日本侵略者那样遭受最后的失败！
                                      中华全国学生联合会
                                                  十一月九日
