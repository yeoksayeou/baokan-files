　　Volunteering to Participate in Military Transport to Resist American Imperialism
    Korean Drivers Return to Motherland
    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Northeast Daily: Korean automobile drivers residing in Northeast China, in order to contribute their share to the war of resisting American imperialism and defending their country, voluntarily agreed to return to their motherland to participate in military transportation. This group of drivers totals 546 people. Since the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, they have all felt extreme hatred seeing their motherland ravaged, and resolutely demanded to return to their country to kill the enemy. Jin Changluo from Hunchun County said, with every word filled with pain: "I am a young man of the Korean nationality. I have lived like an ox or a horse under the feet of Japanese imperialism for 36 years. Since the 'August 15th' liberation, after a few years of construction, we were just about to live a good life, but American imperialism came to invade again. I believe that the conscious Korean people will never willingly be slaves again! I must return to my country to participate in the great patriotic war. I am willing to shed the last drop of blood on the battlefield of the motherland!" Li Jiongkui said: "The beautiful Korean territory has been set on fire by the American imperialists. This fire has already burned to the Chinese border, and it will also burn our homes. If we don't stand up again, we will be burned to death and starve to death. I must use my skills to participate in the battle and dedicate myself to the end!" Han Changgen said: "I have a family, but I put aside all family concerns. I know that there must be Korea and China before there can be me...." Comrade Han Shulong has been transferred to another job for several years, but he also came to the automobile driver brigade. He said: "Although my strength is small, I have the enthusiasm to love my country and the skills to fight for my country. I am not afraid of being crushed to pieces!"

    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：留居东北境内的朝鲜籍汽车司机，为在抗击美帝保卫祖国的战争中尽自己的一份力量，自愿相约返回祖国参加军事运输。这批司机共五百四十六人，自美国发动侵朝战争以后，遥望祖国遭受蹂躏，无不万分痛恨，坚决要求返回祖国杀敌。珲春县金昌洛曾一字一痛地说：“我是朝鲜民族青年，过去在日本帝国主义的脚踏下过了三十六年的牛马生活，自从“八一五”解放后，经过几年建设，我们刚刚要过好的生活，美帝却又来侵略，我相信有觉悟的朝鲜人民，决不甘愿再作亡国奴！我一定要回国参加伟大的卫国战争，我愿在祖国的疆场上流尽最后一滴血！”李炯奎说：“美丽的朝鲜疆土，被美帝点了火，这火已烧到中国的边疆，也将要烧掉我们的家，我们再不站起来，就将被烧死饿死，我一定要以我的技术，参加战斗，献身到底！”韩昌根说：“我有家，但我把一切家庭顾虑都放下，我知道先有朝鲜和中国才有我……。”韩束龙同志已经转业好几年了，但也到汽车司机大队来，他说：“虽然我的力量微小，但我有爱祖国的热诚，并且有技术，为祖国而战，不怕粉身碎骨！”
