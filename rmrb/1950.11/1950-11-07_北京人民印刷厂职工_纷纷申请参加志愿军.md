　　Workers of the Beijing People's Printing Factory
　　Eagerly Apply to Join the Volunteer Army
　　[This newspaper reports] After the workers of the Beijing People's Printing Factory read the joint declaration of the democratic parties, their morale was very high, and they wrote letters of application one after another, requesting to join the Volunteer Army and fight side by side with the Korean people. Workers Wang Zengkui and eight others wrote in their application: "Japanese imperialism invaded China, and we have tasted enough of the taste of being slaves. Fortunately, the Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese people to defeat Japanese imperialism and the American imperialist lackey Chiang Kai-shek. We are beginning to build an independent, free, and happy new China. American imperialism will not let us live a good life, occupying Taiwan, invading Korea, and wanting to invade our Northeast. It is clearly following the old path of Japanese imperialism, and we can no longer tolerate it." Worker Kan Shiping said in his application: "We cannot allow American imperialism to take away the freedom and democracy that we exchanged for blood, flesh, and heads from Japanese imperialism." Worker Li Wenzhong said in his application: "For the sake of world peace, we have signed the peace declaration. Now we must turn our signatures into practical actions, turn our anger into strength, and resolutely defeat the invading army of American imperialism." Ling Biying, an old worker in his sixties, also applied to join the Volunteer Army. He said: "Although I am already sixty years old, I am not giving in to old age. I am still adhering to the fighting spirit of the past thirty years and volunteering to go to the front line to resist American imperialism."
　　Yesterday was Sunday, and there were not many workers staying in the factory, but the number of applicants to join the Volunteer Army reached seventy-eight by 3:30 p.m.

　　北京人民印刷厂职工
    纷纷申请参加志愿军
    【本报讯】北京人民印刷厂工人看了各民主党派联合宣言后，情绪非常高涨，纷纷写申请书，请求参加志愿军，和朝鲜人民并肩作战。工人王增魁等九人在申请书上写道：“日本帝国主义侵略我们中国，亡国奴的滋味尝够了，幸有中国共产党领导中国人民打垮了日本帝国主义及美帝国主义走狗蒋介石，我们正在开始建立独立、自由和幸福的新中国，美帝国主义不叫我们过好日子，侵占台湾，侵略朝鲜，又要侵略我们东北，明明是走日本帝国主义的老路，我们再不能容忍了。”工友阚世平在其申请书上说：“我们不能把从日本帝国主义手里用血、肉、头颅换来的自由、民主，叫美帝国主义再夺去。”工友李文忠在申请书上说：“我们为了世界和平，已在和平宣言上签了名。现在我们要把签名变成实际行动，把愤恨变成力量，坚决打垮美帝的侵略军队。”六十多岁的老工友凌必应也申请参加志愿军，他说：“我虽已年迈六十，但我不服老，仍本着三十年的斗争精神，志愿到前线去抵抗美帝侵略。”
    昨天是星期日，留厂工人不多，但申请参加志愿军者截至下午三时半止，已达七十八人。
