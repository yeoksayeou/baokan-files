The Correct Understanding of the Catholic and Christian Issues

I. The Situation of Catholicism and Christianity in China

In China, the issues of Catholicism and Christianity are, on the one hand, religious issues, that is, the beliefs of the masses produced under certain social conditions, and on the other hand, issues of being used by imperialism as tools to invade our people over a long period. We should grasp both aspects of this issue, understand the connections and distinctions between these two aspects, and correctly handle religious issues based on the policies of the Central People's Government.

Catholicism and Christianity were introduced into China very early, but their widespread development occurred after the Opium War. After the Opium War, due to the entry of a large number of foreign missionaries into China, the influence of Catholicism and Christianity in China gradually expanded. The activities of these two religions were deeply related to imperialist aggression against China from the very beginning. Both religions ran many churches, schools, hospitals, and other cultural and relief institutions in China. The vast majority of these institutions were subsidized by foreign countries and were actually led by foreign clergy. Therefore, it was very easy for imperialism to influence and control the activities of the church. Some church organizations were used as organs for imperialist espionage activities. According to statistics, among the Catholic clergy (i.e., priests, monks, etc. who rely on religion for a living) in the country, foreigners accounted for nearly half (5,500 out of 12,000), and among Christian clergy, foreigners accounted for 17 percent (1,700 out of 10,000). Among both religions, the British and American churches accounted for the main forces, and in recent years, the power of the American church has surpassed that of the British. Although the imperialist influence in these two religions has been severely hit since liberation, and many patriotic Chinese believers have gradually realized the imperialists' conspiracy to use the church for aggression, the imperialists are not willing to retreat. Even now, they still have many foreign clergy in the churches of the two religions and control economic power and property rights. They try to maintain the influence and actual leadership of imperialism in the church, and carry out provocative and divisive activities among believers, and continue to conduct counter-revolutionary propaganda and espionage activities. The patriotic people of our country must be vigilant against these activities and should give them severe blows.

Catholicism and Christianity have developed a considerable number of believers among the Chinese masses. It is estimated that there are about three million Catholics in China, 80 percent of whom are in rural areas; and about 700,000 Christians, 70 percent of whom are in rural areas. Christianity has established external organizations such as the YMCA and YWCA in cities. Women account for nearly half of the believers. The main reason why these masses believe in religion is that they suffer from the oppression of the old social system, their political consciousness has not been properly enlightened, and they want to seek comfort from religious belief. After liberation, especially in areas where the land reform has been completed, due to the improvement of the consciousness of workers and peasants, the influence of religion has weakened, but its influence and power will still exist for a considerable period.

Due to the victory of the people's revolution and the upsurge of anti-imperialism, a patriotic and anti-imperialist movement has also emerged among Chinese Christians. Recently, Wu Yaozong and others published a declaration entitled "The Way for Chinese Christianity to Strive in the Construction of New China," calling on the church to gradually break away from imperialist influence and economic relations, and implement self-government, self-support, and self-propagation. This declaration has been signed by 6,000 believers, and the signature campaign is still expanding. The 14th Annual Meeting of the National Christian Council of China, held in Shanghai on October 18, also expressed its support for the declaration. A progressive reform movement has begun in Chinese Christianity. This movement should be valued by us, and at the same time, appropriate assistance should be given from the side, and it should be regarded as an important task in dealing with church issues at present.

II. The Marxist-Leninist Attitude and Policy towards Religion

Marxist-Leninists are thorough atheists. However, Marxist-Leninists have always treated mass religious issues as a social issue with historical necessity. Lenin said: "We must explain from a materialist point of view why religious belief is still popular among the masses." ("The Attitude of the Workers' Party towards Religion") Therefore, Marxist-Leninists have always opposed any erroneous opinions and actions that rely on administrative orders and other simple and impatient methods to solve religious issues.

The patriotic people of China do not believe that Catholicism and Christianity are religions that should be prohibited or excluded, but only oppose imperialists using their churches to carry out aggression. On the ideological front, materialists and religious believers cannot and should not be forced to reconcile, but in the political actions of defending the motherland, building the motherland, opposing aggression, and striving for peace, materialists and religious believers can and should unite completely. Chairman Mao said in "On New Democracy": "Communists can establish an anti-imperialist united front in political action with some idealists and even religious believers, but they must never agree with their idealism or religious dogmas."

Therefore, the principle of all patriotic people in our country (including patriotic believers) towards Chinese Catholicism and Christianity should be: protect freedom of belief, but eliminate imperialist influence in all religions and develop patriotic influence. Catholicism and Christianity should become social activities of the Chinese people themselves, completely free from foreign coercion.

All patriotic Catholics and Christians should stand with the people of the whole country, expose the imperialists' conspiracy to use religion to carry out espionage activities, oppose the reactionaries in the church who are still colluding with imperialism, implement the church's self-government, self-support, and self-propagation in a step-by-step manner, gradually get rid of imperialist influence and economic relations, and turn the church into the cause of Chinese believers themselves. For special agents who carry out sabotage activities and espionage activities in the church, whether they are foreigners or Chinese, the People's Government should of course resolutely punish them in accordance with Article 7 of the Common Program. Here, naturally, the counter-revolutionary activities of these special agents should be separated from religious issues, and the special agents in the church should be separated from the entire church, church, or church cause, etc., and should not be confused. Believers should also clearly understand these two issues, and should not be fooled by imperialist propaganda and mistakenly regard the People's Government's suppression of counter-revolutionary activities as suppression of religious activities. The People's Government's suppression of counter-revolutionary activities is required by the interests of the people of the whole country, which is completely unrelated to religious issues, and patriotic believers should enthusiastically support it.

III. Several Specific Issues Concerning Catholicism and Christianity

Regarding these two religions, there are also several specific issues that should be properly handled.

First, the issue of evangelism. Article 5 of the Common Program stipulates that the people have freedom of religious belief, and the government naturally guarantees this freedom, and at the same time, it naturally does not restrict the people's freedom to not believe in religion or even oppose religion. However, when religious propaganda and anti-religious propaganda become mass activities, they may affect the stability of social order and increase unnecessary disturbances. For the sake of social order, the reasonable method should be that the church does not preach outside the church, and at the same time, other groups or masses should not conduct anti-religious propaganda in the church. In addition, according to existing experience, in areas where land reform is in progress, church activities may affect the order of land reform work, so before the land distribution is completed, all activities inside and outside the churches in these areas (including worship and Bible study) should be temporarily suspended.

For the purpose of evangelism, the church can publish books and periodicals that promote general religious doctrines, but the content of these books and periodicals should not violate the Common Program. Some books and periodicals published by the church, under the guise of promoting religion, actually spread remarks slandering people's democracy. The government should of course prohibit such books and periodicals, the existing books should be destroyed, and the organs that publish these books and periodicals should be punished by law.

Second, the issue of dealing with church schools, hospitals and other relief agencies, etc. Chairman Mao once said in "On Coalition Government": "As long as believers abide by government laws, the government will give them protection, and believers and non-believers each have their freedom, and no coercion or discrimination is allowed." The same is true for dealing with the undertakings run by the church. As long as they abide by the Common Program and government laws and decrees, the government will treat them the same as general private undertakings in accordance with the principle of taking into account both public and private interests. Church schools should also implement government laws and regulations like other schools, and political classes, which are compulsory courses in other schools, should also be set up in church schools. Religious courses may be allowed to be set up as elective courses in church-run universities. Believing and non-believing students should not attack and stimulate each other on the issue of belief, disrupting school order. On the contrary, they should unite with each other under the principle of loving the country and loving the school, and jointly oppose imperialism and special agents.

Third, housing disputes that have occurred in some places should also be properly resolved. Generally speaking, when the government wants to requisition or borrow church houses, it should be resolved through consultation with the church, and should not be forcibly occupied. On the church's side, it should also take care of the difficulties of the public and lend vacant and unused houses for public use.

Of course, there are many such problems. In general, everything should be done in accordance with government laws and regulations, so as to be fair and reasonable, and there should be no exceptions due to the church or discrimination against the church.

### 对于天主教基督教问题应有的认识

专栏：

　　对于天主教基督教问题应有的认识
    一、天主教和基督教在中国的情况
    在中国，天主教和基督教问题，一方面是宗教问题，即在一定社会条件下所产生的群众的信仰问题，一方面又是在长时期中被帝国主义利用作为工具来向我国人民进行侵略的问题。我们应当掌握这问题的两方面，认识这两方面的联系和区别，根据中央人民政府的政策，来正确地处理有关宗教的问题。
    天主教基督教的传入中国很早，但它的普遍发展则是在鸦片战争以后。在鸦片战争以后，由于大批外国传教士的进入中国，天主教和基督教在中国的影响逐渐扩大。这两个宗教的活动一开始就和帝国主义的对华侵略有深切的关系。两个宗教都在中国办有许多教堂、学校、医院及其他文化、救济机关。这些机关绝大部分都受外国津贴，并由外国教士占据实际领导地位。因此，帝国主义就很容易影响和控制教会的活动。有些教会组织则被作为帝国主义进行间谍活动的机关。据统计，全国天主教士（即依靠宗教为生的神父、修士等）中，外国人几占一半（一万二千人中占五千五百人），基督教教士中，外国人占百分之十七（一万人中占一千七百人）。两个宗教中都以英美教会占主要势力，近年来美国教会的势力又超过了英国。解放以后这两个宗教中帝国主义的影响虽然受到了重大的打击，许多爱国的中国教徒也逐渐认识到帝国主义利用教会进行侵略的阴谋，但虽然如此，帝国主义者却不甘心退却，直到现在，他们仍在两个宗教的各教会中留有许多外国教士并掌握着经济权和财产权，他们力图保持帝国主义在教会中的影响和实际领导权，并且在教徒中进行挑拨离间，继续进行反革命的宣传和间谍活动。对于这些活动，我国爱国人民必须提高警惕，并应予以严厉的打击。
    天主教和基督教在中国群众中间都已发展了相当多的教徒。据估计，天主教徒在中国约有三百万人，百分之八十在农村；基督教徒约七十万人，百分之七十在农村。基督教在城市中设有男女青年会等外围团体。教徒中妇女几占一半。这些群众之信教，主要是由于在旧社会制度压迫下，生活痛苦，政治觉悟没有得到适当的启发，因而想从宗教信仰中去寻求慰藉。解放以后，特别在土地改革完成地区，由于工农觉悟的提高，宗教的影响已趋削弱，但是在一个相当长的时期中，它们的影响和力量将仍然存在。
    由于人民革命的胜利，反帝热潮的高涨，在中国基督教徒中也产生了爱国反帝的运动。最近吴耀宗等发表了以《中国基督教在新中国建设中努力的途径》为题的宣言，号召教会逐渐脱离帝国主义的影响与经济关系，实行自治、自养、自传，这个宣言已经取得了六千教徒的签名，签名运动还在继续扩大。中华全国基督教协进会十月十八日在沪举行的第十四届年会上，亦对该宣言表示拥护。中国基督教中已经开始了一种有进步意义的革新运动。这种运动应该被我们所重视，同时并应从旁予以适当赞助，把它看作是当前对待教会问题上的一项重要工作。
    二、马列主义者对待宗教的态度和方针
    马列主义者是彻底的无神论者。但是马列主义者对于群众性的宗教问题，从来是当作一种有历史必然性的社会问题来处理的。列宁说：“我们要从唯物主义的观点上去解释宗教信仰为什么还流行于群众中间。”（《工人党对于宗教的态度》）所以马列主义者从来反对任何依靠行政命令和其他简单急躁办法去解决宗教问题的错误意见和错误行为。
    中国的爱国人民并不认为天主教和基督教是应当禁止或排斥的宗教，仅仅反对帝国主义者利用它们的教会来进行侵略。在思想战线上，唯物主义者和宗教信徒虽不能也不应强为调和，但是在保卫祖国建设祖国反对侵略争取和平的政治行动上，唯物主义者和宗教信徒却完全可以而且应当联合起来。毛主席在《新民主主义论》中说：“共产党员可以与某些唯心论者甚至宗教徒建立政治行动上的反帝统一战线，但是决不能赞同他们的唯心论或宗教教义。”
    因此，我国一切爱国人民（包括爱国的教徒在内）对待中国的天主教和基督教的原则应该是：保护信仰自由，但是在一切宗教中都应当消除帝国主义的影响，而发展爱国主义的影响，天主教和基督教应当变为完全不受外国挟持的，属于中国人自己的社会活动。
    一切有爱国心的天主教、基督教徒，应该与全国人民站在一起，揭露帝国主义利用宗教进行间谍活动的阴谋，反对教会中仍与帝国主义勾结的反动分子，有步骤地实现教会的自治、自养、自传，逐渐摆脱帝国主义的影响和经济关系，把教会变为中国教徒自己的事业。对于教会中进行破坏活动与间谍活动的特务分子，不论其为外国人或中国人，人民政府当然应该依照共同纲领第七条予以坚决的惩处。在这里，自然应该把这些特务分子的反革命活动和宗教问题分别开来，把教会中的特务分子与整个教会、教堂或教会事业等分别开来，而不要加以混淆。教徒也应把这两个问题认识清楚，不要上了帝国主义挑拨宣传的当，误把人民政府镇压反革命活动认作是压制宗教活动。人民政府镇压反革命活动是全国人民的利益所要求的，这与宗教问题完全无关，有爱国心的教徒自应加以热烈拥护。
    三、关于天主教基督教的几个具体的问题
    关于这两个宗教，还有几个具体问题，也应加以适当处理。
    第一，是传教问题。共同纲领第五条规定了人民有宗教信仰自由，政府自然保障这种自由，同时自然也并不限制人民有不信仰宗教以至反对宗教的自由。但是宗教的宣传和反宗教的宣传，变成群众性的活动时，则可能影响到社会秩序的安定，增加不必要的纷扰。为了社会秩序的安定，合理的办法应该是教会不去教堂以外传教，同时其他团体或群众也不要到教堂内去进行反宗教的宣传。此外，根据已有的经验，在正在进行土地改革的地区，教会的活动可能影响到土改工作的秩序，所以在土地分配完竣以前，这些地区的教堂内外的一切活动（包括做礼拜查经）都以暂时停止为宜。
    为了传教，教会可以出版宣传一般教义的书刊，但这些书刊的内容不应违反共同纲领。有些教会出版的书刊，借宣传宗教为名，实际上散布诬蔑人民民主的言论。这样的书刊，政府当然应该禁止，存书应该销毁，出版这些书刊的机关并应受到法律的处分。
    第二，是对待教会学校、医院及其他救济机关等的问题。毛主席在《论联合政府》中曾经说过：“只要教徒遵守政府法律，政府就给以保护，信教和不信教的各有他们的自由，不许加以强迫和歧视。”对待教会所办的事业，也是一样，只要遵守共同纲领和政府法令，政府就会按公私兼顾的原则和一般私营事业同样看待。教会学校也应和其他学校一样实行政府法令，其他学校作为必修课的政治课，教会学校中也应设立。教会办的高等学校中可以允许设立宗教课为选修课。信教和不信教的学生，不应在信仰问题上互相攻讦刺激，扰乱学校秩序，相反地，应该是在爱国家爱学校的原则下互相团结，共同反对帝国主义和特务分子。
    第三，有些地方发生的房屋纠纷问题，也应当加以适当的解决。一般地说，政府要征用或借用教会房屋时，应该与教会方面以协商方法来解决，不应强迫占用。在教会方面说，也应该照顾公家的困难，把空闲不用的房屋借给公家用。
    这样一类问题当然还有许多。总的说来，一切均应该按照政府法令办事，做到公平合理，不能因教会而有所例外或因教会而予以歧视。
