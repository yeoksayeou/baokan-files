　　Common Hatred, Mutual Love
    —Visiting Korean Residents—
    ·Lu Niangao·
    The friendship between the Chinese and Korean people has always been as close as blood. In the autumn of 1945, Chinese people and Korean residents in Beijing jointly confronted American imperialist soldiers.

    At that time, after the Japanese surrendered, Korean residents in Beijing, unable to bear the persecution of the Kuomintang bandits, returned to their country one after another. A Korean resident sold all his property for 200,000 yuan in puppet currency, preparing to leave Beijing. Near Qianmen, he encountered three American imperialist soldiers who robbed him of all his money. The Korean was furious and rushed forward, grabbing two of the American soldiers and using the Korean method of fighting, headbutting each of them to the ground. The third American soldier ran over and beat him, causing his face to bleed. But he seized an opportunity and headbutted the third American soldier as well. At that moment, the puppet police wanted to take him away. The surrounding Chinese people were outraged, and they testified that he was the one who had been robbed, that he had done nothing wrong, and they would not allow the puppet police to distort the facts. They searched the American thugs and returned the money to him, covering his escape.

    This event spread among the Korean residents at the time. Five years later, Kim Myung-hwan, a Korean dentist at the Jilin Dental Clinic in Beijing, told me about it, using it to illustrate the common hatred and mutual love between the Chinese and Korean people.

    Dr. Kim Myung-hwan said that he had seen through the American imperialists' disregard for the Korean people more than a decade ago. At that time, he worked at the Jaejoong Dental Clinic, a church hospital in Gwangju, Korea. An American doctor named Levy in the hospital consistently looked down on Koreans. Once, to show off, he took a technician to the countryside and extracted 999 teeth in a day and a half. To make it an even thousand, he pulled another one on the train back to Gwangju. He immediately frantically wrote a report to the United States, saying he had set a new world record by extracting a thousand teeth in a day and a half. Dr. Kim said bitterly, "He simply didn't treat the lives of Koreans as important. If he had a dog, he wouldn't have treated it so recklessly."

    Stories like this are countless.

    Before liberation, when American troops were stationed in Beijing, Korean residents, like the Chinese people, suffered humiliation and persecution from those American imperialist soldiers. Near Tianqiao, two Korean female students were abducted to the barracks by American soldiers and subjected to brutal abuse. After protests from the Korean Residents Association, they were rescued a week later. In the same area, a Korean woman who went to the street to buy things during the day was also dragged away and raped by American soldiers.

    The Korean people have never forgotten these decades of accumulated hatred. The outbreak of the American imperialist war of aggression against Korea aroused the anger of all Korean people. Korea was cruelly ruled by the Japanese imperialists for thirty-six years. The Korean people experienced countless hardships and shed countless blood before establishing a happy and independent Democratic People's Republic of Korea. They would never allow the American imperialists to follow the old path of the Japanese imperialists. At the Korean Elementary School in Beijing, twelve-year-old student Xiao Chengji angrily told me, "We want independence, but American imperialism won't allow it. America is so far away from Korea, we didn't go to America to fire a single shot, so why did it come to our Korea to bomb and kill people?" Fourteen-year-old Kim Bok-soon said, "American imperialism is just like the picture in the United Bookstore: a poisonous snake stretching its head from far away in America to bite Korea. We must kill it!" Some Korean residents in Beijing have already returned to their country to participate in the war against American aggression. Those who remain in Beijing are stepping up their work. Kang Chae-soon, the principal of the Korean Elementary School in Beijing, has only been reunited with her husband, who joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Yanbian in 1946, for a week last year in Beijing. Now her husband has returned to the country to kill the enemy, and she is not sad at all. She told me that she also eagerly hopes to return to the country and work on the front lines.

    The Korean people have a strong fighting friendship with their Chinese brothers, who have experienced similar fates. They know that the enemies of the Korean people are the enemies of the Chinese people; the enemies of the Chinese people are also the enemies of the Korean people. They regard China's victory as their own. This is not only manifested in the countless Korean people who joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army, their blood sprinkled all over Chinese land during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, but also fully demonstrated in their daily work. Mr. Ma Chaoqun, a Korean teacher in the Department of Oriental Languages at Peking University, urged his students to study hard after listening to General Chen Yi's lecture on the history of the Chinese revolutionary struggle at Peking University last year. He said that the fruits of victory do not come easily, and everyone should work even harder in construction. He not only said this, but also tightened his grip on teaching work. When I talked to Dr. Kim Myung-hwan about the Chinese People's Liberation Army, he said that after the liberation of Beijing, he saw the well-disciplined and powerful People's Liberation Army and felt indescribable excitement. "I felt very relieved and no longer afraid of imperialist aggression."

    Now, the enthusiastic movement of resisting America and aiding Korea, which is being carried out by the Chinese people, has further strengthened the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. Dr. Kim Myung-hwan said that he has lived in China for twelve years and has never seen such enthusiastic international friendship as today. All his friends say as soon as they meet, "Today, our school promoted resisting America and aiding Korea in such and such a way." "Today, I saw a propaganda team on the street doing such and such things." Principal Kang Chae-soon said, "The friendship between the Chinese and Korean people and the gratitude of the Korean people to the Chinese people are simply beyond words. Since the movement to resist America and aid Korea began, the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people has increased several times more than before! I will never forget this enthusiastic friendship." She wholeheartedly taught the students of the Peking University propaganda team to dance Korean dances and borrowed Korean clothes for them. Mr. Ma Chaoqun and Mr. Li Qilie, another Korean teacher in his department, worked with the students of Peking University after the movement to resist America and aid Korea began. Mr. Ma accompanied the student propaganda team to various places to promote without missing a single time; Mr. Li was busy compiling "Korean Handbook" and "History of Korean National Liberation". They said that they have seen many student movements in China for twenty years, but none of them have been as enthusiastic and lasting as this one. The enthusiastic mood of the Chinese people has strengthened their confidence in victory. When they saw every acquaintance on the Peking University conscription list, they enthusiastically shook hands and thanked him.

    When the joint declaration of the Chinese democratic parties was published, the Korean residents felt infinitely encouraged, believing that with the support of 475 million Chinese people, the Korean People's Army would fight even more vigorously. When the news of the great victory of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea came, they were overjoyed. That day, Mr. Ma Chaoqun and Mr. Li Qilie specially drank heartily to celebrate. Mr. Ma told me, "After the American imperialists landed at Incheon, if the Korean people did not have strong international assistance, the war would be longer and more arduous. Just when we were in the most difficult and critical situation, the Chinese People's Anti-American Aid Korea Volunteer Army came, how could we not be excited? This righteous act of the Chinese people dealt a fatal blow to the American imperialists!" Mr. Li said, "Now that we have the help of our big brother China, victory is absolutely no problem."

　　共同的恨，相互的爱
    —访问朝鲜侨民—
    ·卢念高·
    中朝人民的友谊一向是血肉相关的。一九四五年的秋天，在北京就发生过中国人民和朝鲜侨民共同对付美帝兽兵的事情。
    那时，日寇投降了，北京的朝鲜侨民，因为受不了国民党匪帮的迫害，纷纷回国。有个朝鲜侨民把他所有的财产卖了二十万元伪法币，准备离京。他在前门附近遇见三个美帝兽兵，抢走了他所有的钱。这个朝鲜人气极了，就赶上前去，拖住两个美兵，用朝鲜人打架惯用的方法，一头一个把两个美兵撞倒地上。第三个美兵跑过来，把他打的满脸流血。但是他瞅个空子，一头把第三个美兵也撞倒了。当时伪警察想把他带走。周围的中国人动了公愤，大家证明他是被抢的人，他没有错，不许伪警察颠倒黑白，并且把钱从美国匪徒身上搜出来，交还他，掩护他走掉。
    这件事当时在朝鲜侨民里传遍了。五年后的今天，北京鸡林牙科医院朝鲜侨民金明焕大夫转告给我，用它来说明中朝人民共同的恨、相互的爱。
    金明焕大夫说，十几年前他就看透了美帝国主义者是不拿朝鲜人民当人看的。那时他在朝鲜光州的一个教会医院——济众牙科医院里工作。医院里有个叫利维的美国大夫，一贯轻视朝鲜人。有一次，他为了出风头，就带了一个技工到乡村去，一天半拔了九百九十九个牙。为了凑足一千，他在回光州的火车上，又拔了一个。他马上疯狂地向美国写份报告，说他创了世界新纪录，一天半拔了一千个牙。金大夫恨恨地说：“他简直不拿朝鲜人的性命当回事。如果他有条狗的话，他对它都不会这样胡闹。”
    像这样的事是数也数不清的。
    解放前，美军驻在北京时，朝鲜侨民和中国人民一样地受那些美帝兽兵的侮辱迫害。在天桥附近，就有两个朝鲜女学生被美兵劫到兵营去，横加蹂躏。经朝鲜侨民会抗议后，过了一个星期才被救出来。在同一个地方，白天上街买东西的一个朝鲜妇女，也被美兵拉走奸污了。
    这些积累了几十年的仇恨，朝鲜人民并没有一天忘记。美帝侵朝战争开始后，更引起所有朝鲜人民的愤怒。朝鲜被日帝残酷地统治了三十六年，朝鲜人民经历了无数的苦难，洒了无数的热血，才建立了一个幸福独立的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。他们绝不许美帝再走日帝的老路。在北京朝鲜小学校里，十二岁的小学生萧承吉气愤地告诉我：“我们要独立，美帝国主义就是不让。美国和朝鲜隔的这么远，我们没有到美国去放一炮，它凭什么到我们朝鲜来轰炸、杀人？”十四岁的金福顺说：“美帝就和联合书店摆的那张画一样：一条毒蛇从美洲远远地伸过头来咬朝鲜，我们非打死它不可！”在北京的朝鲜侨民，有的已经回国去参加抗美战争去了。留在北京的都在加紧工作。北京朝鲜小学姜彩顺校长，自从她爱人一九四六年在延边参加中国人民解放军后，两人只在去年在北京聚会过一星期。现在她爱人已经回国杀敌去了，她一点也不难过，她对我说：她也热望着能回国到前方去工作。
    朝鲜人民对于有过相似命运的中国兄弟，有着浓厚的战斗的友情。他们知道朝鲜人民的敌人就是中国人民的敌人；中国人民的敌人也就是朝鲜人民的敌人。他们把中国的胜利看成和自己的一样。这不止表现在无数朝鲜人民参加了中国人民解放军，在抗日和解放战争中，他们的热血洒遍了中国的土地，而且在他们的日常工作中，也充分地表现了这一点。在北大东方语文学系任教的朝籍教师马超群先生，去年听了陈毅将军在北大讲中国革命斗争史以后，就更督促同学好好学习。他说胜利的果实得来是不容易的，大家在建设工作中，更应该特别努力。他不止这样说，而且在教学工作上，就抓的更紧了。在我和金明焕大夫谈到中国人民解放军时，他说，在北京解放后，他看到了军纪良好，威力强大的解放军，心里有说不出的兴奋。“我自己感觉到非常放心，再也不怕帝国主义的侵略了。”
    现在，中国人民热烈进行的抗美援朝运动，更密切了中朝人民的战斗的友情。金明焕大夫说，他在中国住了十二年，从来没有看见过今天这样热烈的国际友情。所有他的朋友一见面就说：“今天我们学校里如何如何宣传抗美援朝了。”“今天我在街上看见宣传队如何如何了。”姜彩顺校长说：“中朝人民的友好和朝鲜人民对中国人民的感谢，简直不是言语所能表达出来的。自从抗美援朝运动开始后，中朝人民的友谊比以前更增加了好几倍！我永远忘不了这种热烈的友情。”她尽心地教北大宣传队的同学跳朝鲜舞，替他们借朝鲜衣服。马超群先生和他那系的另一位朝籍教师李启烈先生，在抗美援朝运动开始后，就和北大的同学们一起工作。马先生一次都不缺席地随着学生宣传队到各处去宣传；李先生在紧张地编译《朝鲜手册》和《朝鲜民族解放史》。他们说在中国二十年，看见过许多次学生运动，都没有这次这样热烈持久。中国人民这种热烈情绪，更加强了他们的胜利信心。当他们看到北大参军榜上有名的每一个认识的同学时，他们都热情地向他握手致谢。
    当中国各民主党派联合宣言发表时，朝鲜侨民感觉到无限的鼓舞，认为有了四万七千五百万中国人民的支援，朝鲜人民军将打得更起劲。等到中国人民志愿部队在朝参战大胜的消息传来时，他们更是欢喜若狂。那天，马超群先生和李启烈先生特地为此开怀痛饮了一番。马先生告诉我说：“美帝在仁川登陆后，朝鲜人民如无国际上有力的援助，战争将会更拖长，更艰苦。正在我们最艰苦危急的时候，中国人民抗美援朝志愿部队来了，我们怎么能够不兴奋呢？中国人民这种正义行为，给了美帝致命的打击！”李先生说：“现在我们有了中国老大哥的帮助，胜利是绝无问题了。”
