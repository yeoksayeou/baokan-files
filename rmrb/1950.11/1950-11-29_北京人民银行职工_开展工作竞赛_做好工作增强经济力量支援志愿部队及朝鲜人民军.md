Beijing People's Bank Employees
    Launch Work Competition
    Do a Good Job to Enhance Economic Strength and Support the Volunteer Army and Korean People's Army
    [Our newspaper's dispatch] Under the leadership of the trade union and its branches of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, including the business department, more than 2,000 employees and members of 23 units launched a patriotic work competition in early October. Everyone unanimously expressed: Use practical actions—do a good job and strengthen the economic front to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army to eliminate the American aggressors.
    After the launch of this competition, a wave of challenges and responses was set off within each unit and between units. The broad masses of members and departments, offices, sections, and shares involved in the competition battle unanimously formulated specific work plans around the bank's central tasks for this winter, and determined their respective goals: overfulfilling the task of absorbing deposits, improving work methods, improving work efficiency, saving expenses, and reducing state expenditures.
    The bank's trade union and its branches carried out continuous organization and leadership work in this movement: formulating plans through democratic forms and conducting specific inspections, promptly evaluating and commending, and more promptly proposing slogans such as "Three Fear Nots" (not afraid of being busy, not afraid of being tired, not afraid of trouble), "Three Goods" (good attitude towards depositors, good internal and external contacts, good methods of absorbing deposits) and "Three Quicks" (fast with abacus, fast with writing tickets, fast with counting banknotes) to encourage the development of the movement.
    The specific plans for these work competitions are mostly being carried out or are nearing completion. Several units have first achieved significant results, such as: the West Chang'an Street office overfulfilled its savings task in October by 264 percent, remittances by 315 percent, and public deposits by 16 percent; the Fengtai office overfulfilled its savings task by 110 percent and received the first award flag. In addition, the Savings Department's "one household per person" movement has also achieved great results. To date, an average of five households have been developed per person, exceeding the original number of households by four times.
    The savings plans formulated by departments, offices, secretaries, general affairs and other departments in the movement have also been put into practice one after another: the Chongwenmen Outer Office saved more than 2,200 catties of millet in expenses in October, exceeding the original plan by 50 percent; the Savings Department originally planned to save 4,000 catties of millet in expenses in the four months of winter, but saved 1,300 catties of millet in the first month (October). In addition to the general affairs department's careful calculation and careful inspection of the methods of saving, each trade union member also unanimously responded to the trade union's call to automatically attach importance to this issue. Li Jingyi, a trainee at the Chongwenmen Outer Office, saved 1.13 million yuan in 20 days by paying attention to saving words in telegrams through research; more than 20 members of the Fengtai Office voluntarily transported 12 tons of winter coal in their spare time, saving 130,000 yuan in expenses; the slogan of the members of the Business Department and other units is "Don't waste a piece of paper, a pin."

　　北京人民银行职工
    开展工作竞赛
    做好工作增强经济力量  支援志愿部队及朝鲜人民军
    【本报讯】中国人民银行北京分行营业部等二十三个单位二千多个职工会员在该行工会及各分支会领导下，在十月初展开爱国主义工作竞赛，大家一致表示：用实际行动——做好工作，增强经济战线上的力量用以支援中国人民援朝志愿部队和朝鲜人民军消灭美国侵略者。
    这一竞赛展开后，每一单位内部和各单位之间相互掀起挑战应战浪潮。卷入竞赛战斗中的广大会员及各部、处、科、股等单位一致围绕着该行今冬中心任务定出具体工作计划，确定各自努力的目标：超额完成吸收存款任务，改进工作方法，提高工作效率、节约经费，减少国家开支。
    该行工会及各分支会在这一运动中进行不间断的组织、领导工作：通过民主形式制定计划并进行具体检查及时评定表扬，更及时提出：“三不怕”（不怕忙、不怕累、不怕麻烦），“三好”（对存户态度好、内外联系好、吸收存款方法好）及“三快”（算盘打的快、传票开的快、钞票点的快）等口号，鼓舞了运动的开展。
    这些工作竞赛的具体计划，大部正在努力进行中或接近完成，有若干单位并首先获得显著的成绩，如：西长安街办事处十月份储蓄超额完成百分之二百六十四，汇款超额完成百分之三百十五，公营存款超额完成百分之十六；丰台办事处储蓄任务超额完成百分之一百一十，得到第一面奖旗。此外储蓄部“每人一户”运动成绩也很大，至目前平均每人已发展到五户，超过原定户数四倍。
    各部、处秘书、总务等部门在运动中所订定的节约计划也相继见诸事实：崇文门外办事处在十月份节省经费小米二千二百余斤，超过原定计划百分之五十；储蓄部原计划在冬季四个月中节约经费小米四千斤，在第一个月中（十月）就节省了小米一千三百斤。关于节约的办法除了总务部门精打细算、认真检点以外，每个工会会员也一致响应工会号召自动重视这一问题，崇文门外办事处练习生李静宜由于经过钻研在发电报中注意节省用字，二十天内就节省了一百十三万元；丰台办事处二十几个会员利用工余时间自动搬运十二吨冬季用煤，节省了十三万元的开支；营业部等单位的会员节约的口号是“不浪费一片纸，一个大头针”。
