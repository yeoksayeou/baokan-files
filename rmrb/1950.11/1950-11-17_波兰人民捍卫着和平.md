　　The Polish People Defend Peace

　　Poland, with a pre-war population of 32 million, lost 7 million people in World War II.

　　During World War II, Poland was occupied by the German invaders for five and a half years. Cities were destroyed, industries were wrecked, even the land was turned over, and the entire country was looted.

　　But the Polish people were not destroyed. They fought the German occupiers underground and on all fronts. After liberation, they took power into their own hands and began to fight for the restoration and development of the economy and for a better future for the working people.

　　It is not surprising that a country that has suffered all kinds of massacres and horrors and has achieved great success in reconstruction has become one of the most heroic fighters for the defense of lasting world peace. Among Poland's 25 million residents, 18 million have signed the Stockholm Appeal. This is the best proof of the Polish people's firm will to defend peace.

　　But the Polish people understand that it is impossible for individual countries to defend peace separately. They know that only by organizing the forces of all peace-loving people, concentrating the forces of peace, and uniting around the Soviet Union—the powerful defender of world peace—can the crisis of war be stopped and the evil schemes of US imperialism and its vassal states be thwarted. Therefore, the Polish people have participated in every international peace movement with great enthusiasm. Every act of aggression by imperialism has aroused the Polish people's anger against the aggressors and launched a powerful movement in support of the victims of aggression.

　　Now, all the Polish people, including students and youth, sympathize with the heroic struggle of the Korean people. Since the United States began its aggression, $700,000 has been raised as a fund to support the Korean people's struggle. The students and youth of Szczecin have decided to donate a medical plane to Korea, and the youth of the Lublin region have also donated some medical vehicles.

　　The Polish people know that strengthening their country's economic strength is fighting for peace and strengthening the peace camp. Miners exceed their daily production quotas, bricklayers complete school building projects ahead of schedule, and farmers deliver their harvests and increase agricultural production on the land—they are all consciously building the edifice of world peace with their daily labor. Therefore, the Polish people held the First Polish National Peace Congress and are now welcoming the Second World Peace Congress, which opened in Warsaw on November 16.

　　Although Poland suffered serious damage in the war, it exceeded its pre-war production level in 1949, when the Three-Year Plan was completed. Pre-war Poland was an agricultural-industrial country, with industrial production accounting for only 32 percent of the country's total production. When the Six-Year Plan is completed in 1955, Poland will become an industrial country, with its industrial production accounting for 74 percent of the country's total production. Every effort made by the Polish people to complete this arduous task of economic development is an effort to strengthen the world peace camp.

　　The Polish people's contribution to the founding work of the world peace organization is very significant. The First World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace—the 1948 Congress of Intellectuals—was held in Wrocław, Poland. Poland also actively participated in the preparatory work for the First World Peace Congress held simultaneously in Paris and Prague. Now, Poland is honorably hosting the Second World Peace Congress in rebuilt Warsaw. When the British government, disregarding the wishes of the vast majority of the British people, used its administrative power to obstruct the holding of a peace conference in Britain under the instructions of US imperialism, the Polish people warmly welcomed representatives from all over the world—the outstanding sons and daughters of all nations—in their capital. Warsaw, rebuilt on the ruins destroyed by Hitler's imperialists, has become the meeting place for representatives of more than 500 million people (the total number of peace signatures worldwide), where they will give a strong blow to the American imperialists, the successors of fascist Germany. All the Polish people and all honest people in the world are today awaiting the decisions of the Warsaw Peace Congress and will resolutely implement them.

### 波兰人民捍卫着和平

　　波兰人民捍卫着和平
    战前拥有三千二百万居民的波兰，在第二次世界大战中丧失了七百万人口。
    在第二次世界大战中，波兰曾被德寇占领了五年半。城市被破坏了，工业被摧毁了，连土地也被翻过来了，整个国家惨遭掠夺。
    但是波兰人民却并没有被毁灭。他们与德国占领者在地下和一切战线上进行着斗争。解放以后，他们把政权掌握到自己的手里，开始了为恢复与发展经济、为争取劳动人民美好的将来而斗争。
    曾经遭受过一切屠杀恐怖而在重建中得到了巨大成就的国家，成为保卫世界持久和平的最英勇的斗士之一，是不足为奇的。在波兰二千五百万居民中已有一千八百万人在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。这是波兰人民保卫和平的坚决意志的最好证明。
    但是波兰人民了解到：个别的国家分头来保卫和平是不可能的。他们知道，只有把所有爱好和平人民的力量组织起来，把和平的力量集中起来，并团结在苏联——世界和平的强大捍卫者的周围，才能够制止战争的危机并挫败美帝国主义及其附庸国家的罪恶阴谋。因此，波兰人民才以极大的热情参加了每一次的国际和平运动。帝国主义每一次的侵略行动都激起了波兰人民反对侵略者的愤怒，并展开了声援被侵略者的有力的运动。
    现在，波兰全体人民，包括学生青年在内，都同情着朝鲜人民的英勇斗争。从美国开始侵略到现在，已经募集了七十万美元作为支援朝鲜人民斗争的基金。斯才新的学生青年决定捐献一架医疗用的飞机给朝鲜，芦布林区的青年也已捐献了一些医疗车。
    波兰人民知道，加强他们国家的经济实力，就是为和平而斗争，也就是为加强和平阵营而斗争。矿工超过了他们每日的生产定额，砖匠们在限期以前完成了学校房屋的建筑工程，农民们缴纳了收获物并在土地上增加了农产品——他们都是自觉的以日常的劳作来建筑起世界和平的大厦。因此，波兰人民举行了第一届波兰全国和平大会，而现在则迎接了已于十一月十六日在华沙召开的第二届世界和平大会。
    波兰虽然在战争中遭受了严重的破坏，但在一九四九年——三年计划完成的时候它就超过了战前的生产水准。战前的波兰是一个农业——工业国家，工业生产量仅占全国生产量的百分之三十二，在一九五五年六年计划完成时，波兰将成为一个工业国家，它的工业生产量将等于全国生产量的百分之七十四。每一个波兰人民为争取完成这一艰巨的发展经济的任务而作的最大努力，也就是为加强世界和平阵营的努力。
    波兰人民对于世界和平组织奠基工作的供献是十分显著的。第一届世界和平拥护者大会——一九四八年的知识分子大会，就是在波兰的罗克劳举行的。波兰还积极地参加了在巴黎与布拉格同时举行的第一届世界和平大会的筹备工作。现在，波兰又光荣地在重建后的华沙接待了第二届世界和平拥护者大会。当英国政府不顾英国广大人民的意愿而在美帝国主义的指使之下用它的行政权力阻挠在英国召开和平大会的时候，波兰人民在他们首都热烈地接待了从世界各地前来的代表——各民族的优秀儿女。在被希特勒帝国主义者所毁坏的废墟上重建起来的华沙，已经成为五亿以上人民（全世界和平签名总数）的代表们集会的地点，他们在那里将要给法西斯德国的继承者美帝国主义一个有力的打击。所有波兰的人民与全世界一切正直的人民今天正在等待着华沙和平大会的决定，并将坚决地实行这一决定。
