Yanjing University's Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Opposition to American Aggression, Trade Union Branch, held two faculty seminars on the afternoon of the 16th and the morning of the 17th to exchange opinions on everyone's understanding of the United States. This issue is now highly valued at Yanjing University. More than 50 professors, lecturers, and assistants participated in the first seminar, and more than 60 participated in the second. Due to historical reasons, Yanjing University has had relatively extensive relations with Americans in the past, and more than half of the professors are returned students from the United States. At both meetings, everyone conducted in-depth analyses of the United States' politics, economy, society, and culture based on personal experiences, with a particular emphasis on discussing the issue of American cultural aggression against China.

America is Not Democratic and Free; Presidential Elections are Ugly and Unbearable

At the seminars, everyone believed that the undemocratic nature of the American economy is a universally recognized fact and need not be discussed further. In fact, the United States is also completely undemocratic politically. In the United States, not only are Black people completely deprived of political rights, but ordinary white working people also have no way to express their opinions. Professor Zhang Xitong said that people generally mistakenly believe that Americans can vote for whomever they want for president. In fact, this is not the case. Ordinary voters can only choose one of the candidates nominated by the Democratic and Republican parties. The process by which the two parties nominate presidential candidates is even more ugly and unbearable. On the one hand, many people noisily "vote" at the meeting, and on the other hand, a few big bosses negotiate prices in hotels. Before the conditions in the hotel are agreed upon, the election meeting "votes" once, twice, dozens of times, even a hundred and dozens of times, and the candidate is always not "elected." Once the big bosses in the hotel have agreed on who will get what benefits and who will be an official when the president is elected, the presidential candidate at the election meeting is immediately produced. Professor Chen Fangzhi said that in order to understand the United States, it is definitely not enough to look at the surface. For example, during the American presidential election, they always like to paint a small wooden house behind the candidate's large portrait to show that their president is "from a poor background," but which American president is not a puppet of the big capitalists? Professor Yan Jingyao, who used to study criminology in the United States, personally witnessed that American law is only used to rule the majority of law-abiding working people, while a few rich people and gangsters take pleasure in breaking the law.

The seminars also discussed the decadent social atmosphere and general culture of the United States, and emphasized the issue of racial discrimination. They completely look down on Chinese people. Professor Lei Jieqiong said that when she first arrived in the United States to study, she could not rent a house anywhere simply because she was Chinese. Finally, an old German lady agreed to rent her a room, which caused all the other tenants to move out. The old lady had no choice but to return the deposit to her with tears in her eyes. Professor Lei Jieqiong said that after she returned to China, she told others about this, and some shameless lackeys called "upper-class Chinese" ridiculed her, saying, "Of course people look down on her! Her English is so bad!"

John Leighton Stuart is Hypocritical and Uses Sweet Words to Hide His Intention to Invade Our Country

The issue of American cultural aggression against China is a relatively ambiguous one at Yanjing University and has not been well resolved. Some people even believe that while not denying that the United States is politically, militarily, and economically aggressive towards China, Americans are always "well-intentioned" in preaching and running schools in China. At the seminar, Professor Nie Chongqi first expressed doubt about this view. He said that since Americans come to China to preach and run schools out of good intentions, why do they have to force the Chinese to write these things into unequal treaties? Moreover, it is difficult for the Chinese to determine which missionary or "educator" who comes to China is not colluding with the U.S. State Department. The focus of the seminar quickly shifted to John Leighton Stuart. Everyone believed that clarifying John Leighton Stuart's true colors would greatly help in understanding the essence of American cultural aggression against China. At Yanjing University, some people still believe that John Leighton Stuart "really" was a "good person" before becoming the U.S. Ambassador to China, and that he "helped" the Chinese "a lot." When the tenth issue of the "New Yanjing" weekly published students' claims that John Leighton Stuart was an American special agent in China, some people felt it was "too provocative" and "couldn't take it." At the seminar, everyone pointed out that John Leighton Stuart, on the surface, is "solemn and dignified." Although he does not look like a special agent or bandit with a crooked hat and a gun stuck in his butt, in essence, he is not only the vanguard of American cultural aggression, but also a participant in American political and economic aggression against China. In China, on the one hand, he wooed some pro-American elements who were willing to be traitors to act as his lackeys in society. On the other hand, he used his false mask as an "educator" and "friend of China" and the guise of "disciples all over the world" as political capital, personally serving as the U.S. Ambassador to China during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, helping the Kuomintang fight the civil war, cultivating enslaved elements, and undermining the Chinese revolution. He also personally signed various treaties that made the Kuomintang government sell China's sovereignty and interests to the United States from the sky to the ground, from its territory to its territorial waters. When Chinese students rose up to oppose the United States' support for the revival of Japanese aggressive forces for their own interests and national security, this John Leighton Stuart, who claimed to have always "assisted in enhancing the happiness of Chinese students and their mature responsibility for their own country," disregarded exposing his imperialist ferocious face and issued a threatening statement to the Chinese people, slandering the patriotic movement of Chinese students as having "conspiracies" and containing "malicious intentions." John Leighton Stuart's statement aroused widespread anger among righteous Chinese people, but at Yanjing University, there were still people who, while showing patriotism in other aspects, only lightly "regretted" it in this matter. Isn't this still affected by American cultural aggression?

Mr. Li Ou, a lecturer in the Mathematics Department, said that John Leighton Stuart cannot be evaluated by separating his pre-ambassador and post-ambassador stages. Mr. Li said that he felt that he had been influenced by American cultural aggression for a long time, which made him often think in the past that American imperialism was not as hateful as Japanese imperialism. Professors Jiang Yinnen and Lei Jieqiong said that John Leighton Stuart had unchanged and changed aspects in China for decades. What remained unchanged was that he had always been loyal to the American ruling class and helped the reactionary ruling class in China. What changed was that he had a different approach for everyone he met. He wooed warlords, politicians, Kuomintang members, and Japanese people.

John Leighton Stuart has always been regarded as a typical American "educator" in China. In particular, the general faculty and staff of Yanjing University hope to deeply discuss what kind of person he is. The discussion at the seminar became more and more enthusiastic, and in the end, due to time constraints, many people did not have the opportunity to speak. After the meeting, everyone said that they should find time to talk thoroughly about it in the future.

"Voice of America" is a Tool of American Imperialism; Everyone Should Stop Listening to It

The seminar also discussed the issue of the "Voice of America." Everyone denounced the shameless rumors of American imperialism and its running dogs. Professor Zheng Linzhuang said that when he returned from the United States last year via Hong Kong, he heard people say that Professor Chen Fangzhi of Yanjing University had been "assigned" by the Communist Party. Everyone laughed when they heard this, even Professor Chen Fangzhi, who was present. Professor Jiang Yinnen said that when he was in the United States, he saw a "Life" magazine with a photo of the People's Liberation Army holding a ceremony to enter Beijing, showing only the "Communist" ranks led by the band walking alone on the street, with no one welcoming them on either side. At the meeting, everyone unanimously agreed that the "Voice of America" is undoubtedly a huge and vicious rumor-mongering organization of American imperialism. It is a despicable tool used by American imperialism, in addition to special agents, to undermine the Chinese people's regime after American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary regime it supported were basically eliminated on the Chinese mainland. Every Chinese person has a duty to drive the "Voice of America" out of China. As a result of the discussion, everyone believed that in order to make the general public universally stop listening to the "Voice of America," a combination of publicity, education, and coercion should be adopted. On the one hand, everyone should fully understand the vicious nature of the "Voice of America" and consciously and automatically stop listening to it. On the other hand, it is recommended that the government take effective measures to strictly prohibit listening to the "Voice of America," which is harmful and useless to the country, the people, and themselves.

　　燕大教员两次座谈对美国认识
    美帝利用司徒雷登进行侵略活动“美国之音”造谣欺骗必须禁止收听
    【本报讯】燕京大学保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会工会分会在十六日下午和十七日上午举办了两次教员座谈会，交换大家对于美国的认识的意见。这个问题，现在在燕大是很受重视的。第一次座谈有教授、讲助五十多人参加，第二次有六十多人参加。燕大由于历史的原因，过去一向和美国人关系比较多，教授有一大半是美国留学生。两次会上，大家根据亲身的体会，对美国的政治、经济、社会、文化等做了深入的分析，尤其着重地讨论了美国对华的文化侵略问题。
    美国如此民主自由  选举总统丑恶不堪
    座谈会上，大家认为美国的经济不民主已是举世公认的事实，不必多谈。其实在政治上，美国也是完全不民主的。在美国，不但黑人被完全剥夺了政治权利，就是一般白人的劳动群众也是一样无从表示自己的意见。张锡彤教授说，一般人总误以为美国人选总统是爱投谁的票就投谁的票。其实并不如此。一般选民只能在民主党和共和党所推出的候选人里任择其一。而两党推选总统候选人的情形更是丑恶不堪。一方面是很多人在会场上吵吵嚷嚷地“投票”，另一方面则是少数大老板在饭店里讲价钱。在饭店里的条件没有谈妥之前，选举会场上就一次，两次，几十次以至一百几十次地“投票”，候选人总是“选”不出。等饭店里的大老板们谈妥了总统选出时谁得什么便宜谁做什么官儿之后，选举会场上的总统候选人也就立刻产生了。陈芳芝教授说，要想认识美国，单从表面看是一定不够的。例如美国总统竞选时，总是喜欢在候选人的大像后面画上一座矮小的木屋，以表示他们的总统是“贫苦出身”，其实那一任美国总统不是大资本家的傀儡呢？严景耀教授过去曾在美国研究犯罪学，他亲眼看到美国的法律只是用来统治多数的安分守己的劳动人民的，而少数有钱人和地痞流氓反而以犯法做为他们的乐趣。
    座谈会也谈到了美国的堕落的社会风气和一般文化，并着重指出种族歧视的问题。他们是完全看不起中国人的。雷洁琼教授说，她初到美国留学时，就因为自己是一个中国人，到处租不到房子住。好容易有一个德国老太太答应租给她一间屋子，因此竟惹得这位老太太的全体其他房客要搬家。那个老太太不得已只好把定钱又含着眼泪退还她。雷洁琼教授说，她回国后，把这事告诉别人，竟还有无耻的奴才所谓“高等华人”奚落她说：“人家当然瞧不起她！英语说得那么蹩脚！”
    司徒雷登道貌岸然  口蜜腹刀侵略我国
    关于美国对中国的文化侵略问题，在燕大是个比较模糊的问题，一直没有很好地解决。甚至有人虽然并不否认美国在政治、军事、经济上是侵略中国的，但却认为美国人在中国传教、办学校总是“一片好心”。座谈会上，聂崇歧教授对这种见解首先表示怀疑。他说，既然美国人来中国传教、办学校是出于好意，为什么还要强迫中国人把这些写在不平等条约上呢？而且中国人也很难断定那一个来中国的传教士或“教育家”跟美国国务院不勾勾搭搭。座谈的中心很快地转到司徒雷登身上，大家认为只要把司徒雷登的真面目弄清楚，就可以大大地帮助认识美国对中国文化侵略的本质。在燕大，一直还有人认为司徒雷登在做美国驻华大使之前“的确”是个“好人”，认为他对中国人“帮了很多忙”。第十期《新燕京》周刊登载同学们说司徒雷登是美国在中国的特务，还有人觉得“太刺激”，“受不了”。座谈会上大家指出，司徒雷登表面上“道貌岸然”，看来虽不象歪戴帽子，屁股上插只手枪那种特务匪徒，实质上他却不但是美国文化侵略的先锋，而且还是美国对华政治、经济侵略的参加者。他在中国，一方面拉拢些甘心当汉奸的亲美分子，在社会上替他当腿子，另一方面还利用他那“教育家”、“中国的朋友”的假面具和“桃李遍天下”的幌子做政治资本，亲自出马做了国民党反动统治时期的美国驻华大使，帮助国民党打内战，培植奴化分子，破坏中国革命，还亲手签订了使国民党政府把中国主权和利益从天上到地下，从领土到领海都卖给美国的各种条约。当中国的青年学生们为了切身利益和祖国安全起来反对美国扶植日本侵略势力复兴的时候，这位自称一向“协助增进中国学生之幸福及其对自身国家之成熟责任”的司徒雷登，竟不顾暴露其帝国主义的狰狞面目，向中国人民发表了含有极严重威胁意味的恫吓声明，诬蔑中国学生的爱国运动为别有“阴谋”，为含有什么“恶意企图”。司徒雷登这一声明引起了有正义感的中国人的普遍愤怒，而燕大竟还有在其他方面表现得也很爱国的人在这件事上却只轻轻地为他“惋惜”了一下。这还不是受了美国文化侵略的影响么？
    数学系讲师李欧先生说，衡量司徒雷登，不能把他做大使以前和以后两个阶段分开看。李先生说，他觉得他自己很久以来就受了美国文化侵略的影响，这就使他过去常常以为美国帝国主义不如日本帝国主义那样可恨。蒋荫恩、雷洁琼两教授说，司徒雷登在中国几十年来有他不变的和变的两方面。不变的是他一直效忠于美国统治阶级，帮助中国的反动统治阶级。变的是他见了什么人就有一套什么办法。什么军阀、政客、国民党、日本人，他都拉拢。
    司徒雷登过去一向是被认为美国在中国的典型“教育家”。尤其是一般燕大的教职员们，对他究竟是一个什么样的人物这一问题，很希望深入地讨论一下。座谈会上发言愈来愈热烈，最后因为受时间限制，很多人没有得到发言的机会。会后大家表示以后还应该找时间彻底谈一谈。
    “美国之音”美帝工具  每个人应该不再听它
    座谈会上也谈到了“美国之音”的问题。大家纷纷控诉美帝和他的走狗的无耻造谣。郑林庄教授说，去年他从美国回来路经香港时，听人说燕大的陈芳芝教授已被共产党“配给”了。大家听了，连在座的陈芳芝教授也不禁笑起来。蒋荫恩教授说，他在美国时，看到一期“生活”画报上登着一张人民解放军在北京举行入城式的照片，上面只有以乐队前导的“共军”行列在街上孤零零地走着，两旁冷清清地没有一个欢迎的人。会上大家一致认为“美国之音”毫无疑问是美帝国主义的一个庞大而又恶毒的造谣机构。是美帝国主义及其所支持的国民党反动政权在中国大陆上被基本上消灭后，美帝国主义除了特务以外用以破坏中国人民政权的一个卑劣的工具。每一个中国人都有义务把“美国之音”从中国赶出去。讨论结果，大家认为要使一般人普遍地不听“美国之音”，应该采取宣传教育与强制相结合的办法。一方面使每个人充分认识“美国之音”的恶毒本质，自觉自动地不再听它。另一方面建议政府采取有效措施，严厉禁止收听那对国家，对人民，对自己都是有害无益的“美国之音”。
