Letters from Military and Civilians Across the Country to the Korean People and Army and Our Volunteer Army
Vowing to Serve as Backup to Eliminate the American Invaders
Where Imperialism Comes From, We Will Eradicate It There
    Respected comrades of all commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army:
    We were very happy to hear the news of your recent great victory with the help of our Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Because the American devils were once blinded by a temporary "victory,"妄想 to conquer Korea in a short period of time and further invade China. But this plan was completely shattered under your iron hammer.
    Comrades! Your just war of resistance against aggression has won the support of peace-loving people all over the world; especially our Chinese people have participated in this war of liberation with voluntary actions, and stand with you side by side to eliminate the common enemy and ensure permanent peace in the world. This action is not only justified, but also our duty. Resisting America and aiding Korea, protecting our homes and defending our country is the bounden duty of our people, and no one can or has the right to stop us. Because the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people did not start today. Take the War of Resistance Against Japan as an example, regardless of nationality or race, you stood with us through thick and thin, and shed a lot of blood to exchange for victory and today's peaceful construction. This iron fact will never be forgotten by our people. But today, American imperialism has come to invade your sacred territory again,烧杀 Korean compatriots and搶掠 your materials. We can never ignore it. We must take action. We must voluntarily kill the enemy. Where imperialism comes from, we will eliminate it there.
    Finally, I hope that the people of China and Korea will unite closely and advance victoriously towards the early liberation of Korea and the complete and thorough elimination of all enemies.
    Combat Hero He Fuxiang
Hope You Kill the Enemy More Bravely, Final Victory Must Belong to Us
    Respected and Beloved Korean Brothers and Sisters Who Bravely Defend Your Country:
    Because of your heroic war of resistance against aggression, American imperialism has suffered its deserved punishment. A large number of troops are trapped in the mire, forcing it to re-evaluate the strength of peace-loving people in the world.
    Now your war of self-defense is much superior to our liberation war in terms of objective conditions. The two major neighboring countries of China and the Soviet Union with a population of 700 million have enough power to support you, and countries and people who love peace all over the world also support you. What is there to be afraid of from this 美帝 who is struggling to death?
    China has already set off a wave of 抗美援朝. Many volunteer soldiers have also joined you in fighting side by side. I hope you will kill the enemy more bravely. The final victory must belong to the side of justice.
    This short letter cannot describe the enthusiasm in my heart. I sincerely wish you an early victory, and people who love peace all over the world will join hands and move towards a path of peace and happiness.
    Sincerely,
    Revolutionary Salute
    Zhao Zhenou, Relief Committee for Unemployed Workers in Bengbu City
The Chinese People Are Your Backup, Victory Definitely Belongs to the Korean People
    To All Comrades of the Heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's 抗美援朝 Volunteer Army:
    The first batch of Chinese volunteer troops crossed the river and fought side by side with the brothers of the Korean People's Army, and immediately achieved a great victory. We, the revolutionary fighters in the motherland, felt extremely excited when we heard the good news, as joyful as when we heard of the victory of the fraternal troops in the Liberation War. We know that the victory of the Korean people is our own victory. We also know that this victory is only the beginning of victory, and greater victories await us. The American imperialist bandits have felt that this is a heavy blow to them, but a more bleak future awaits American fascism.
    Dear brothers, all comrades of the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, we know that the Korean people are enduring the severe test of war, enduring all difficulties to win the victory against aggression. Your patriotism and internationalism constitute an invincible will,打击 the ferocious enemy. Your comrades in distant North China extend their cordial greetings to you, and wish you continued success in winning greater victories!
    We are stepping up our efforts to磨刀练武, and are ready to join you in winning the victory against aggression. Not only are we doing this, but our entire nation has been invigorated. Everyone is突击 on their work posts in the motherland. This strong reserve force further affirms that victory belongs to the Korean people!
    Your comrades Zhao Wenbin, Bai Feng, Gong Jiemin
The 400,000 Workers in the Capital Vow to Be Your Backup
    Respected Comrades of the Chinese People's 抗美援朝 Volunteer Army:
    For the sake of defending the safety of the motherland, you went to Korea despite the severe cold to resist the aggression of the 美帝 with the Korean People's Army side by side. With the first punch, you knocked the American invading army south of the Qingchuan River, reversing the war situation in Korea, and making American imperialism no longer dare to underestimate the strength of the people of the Far East in defending peace. You are fighting to defend our motherland, you are fighting to defend world peace, you are standing on the front line of the world's resistance to imperialist aggression. Your actions are the most glorious and the most noble. The people of China and the world are paying tribute to you and supporting you with all their strength.
    The 400,000 workers in Beijing are currently redoubling their efforts to work. Many factories have launched enthusiastic patriotic production competitions. In the competition, the workers put forward the slogan "Machines as weapons, factories as battlefields," and resolutely support you with victories on the production front. In addition, the workers in Beijing are taking strengthening current affairs study and strengthening anti-espionage, fire prevention, air defense, and anti-theft work as practical actions in the 抗美援朝保家卫国 movement. Moreover, many workers in Beijing have voluntarily signed up to join the volunteer army, ready to rush to the front at any time to fight the enemy with you!
    Comrades, bravely kill the enemy! All the workers in Beijing vow to be your backup.
    I wish you greater victories!
    Beijing Federation of Trade Unions
Representing the 220,000 People of Huolu County, Fully Support the Volunteer Army
    Respected Warriors of the Chinese Aid-Korea Volunteer Army:
    The Chinese people's support for the Korean people's war against American aggression is not only a moral responsibility, but also closely related to the vital interests of our entire people. Saving our neighbors is saving ourselves, and defending our country requires supporting the Korean people. Facts tell us that the entire people must be urgently mobilized and take practical actions to stop American imperialism's aggression and斩断 American imperialism's bloody claws, so as to protect China's security and defend world peace. You have shown the great heroic spirit of internationalism and patriotism, and voluntarily participated in the Korean war against American aggression. We, on behalf of the 220,000 people of the county, express that we will fully support you and are willing to dedicate everything we have to fight to the end to defend our great motherland!
    抗美援朝保家卫国 Committee of Huolu County, Hebei Province
We Strengthen Work and Study, Practice Thrift and Economy, and Support You in Driving the 美帝 Out of Korea
    Comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army:
    When American imperialism frantically invaded Korea and provoked our country, you самоотверженно defended the peace of the people, helped the Korean people, and annihilated more than 13,000 enemy troops and recovered ten cities in half a month. Your just war for the people has been supported and loved by the broad masses of people. We held a current affairs forum for 123 members of the regiment at the 大众 Theater in our city. In addition to writing to you to express our cordial greetings, we are willing to support you with practical actions. In the future, we plan to implement the following in our work: (1) No rest on Sundays. (2) Work hard to study and do a good job; Finance departments should be vigilant against special agents' sabotage, and public security departments should improve vigilance and strengthen confidentiality. (3) Conduct extensive current affairs propaganda. (4) Streamline and save, and each person guarantees to save two catties of millet per month. (5) Resolutely obey the organization and strive to go to Korea to join the volunteer army. (6) Break the idea of peace and eliminate fear of America. Not only do we have a plan, but we also have the confidence to take action in our practical work. If necessary, we will obtain the permission of the organization and go to Korea to fight the enemy side by side with you.
    Finally, I hope that you will continue to drive the 美帝 out of Korea with the force of thunder and the indomitable spirit!
    Current Affairs Forum of the General Branch of the Baoji Sub-district Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League in Shaanxi Province
We Must Connect Well with the Masses and Be the Backup of the Aid-Korea Volunteer Army
    Comrades of the Aid-Korea Volunteer Army:
    The atrocities of the 美帝 in invading Korea aroused your anger. With the spirit of self-sacrifice, you rose up and rushed to the front line in Korea to participate in the 抗美援朝 war. This demonstrates your high degree of internationalism and patriotism. You also demonstrated great, fearless courage and inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy. Your enthusiasm and courage are worthy of our admiration. Today, we ask you to fight side by side with the Korean people, give full play to your fighting talent on the battlefield, and make the greatest efforts to completely eliminate the American imperialist invading army. We must help Korea achieve liberation as the Korean people helped the Chinese revolution, take back Taiwan, extinguish the flames of American imperialist war of aggression, and fight to the end to defend the permanent peace of the world! We in the rear guarantee to work hard, connect with the masses, and lead the masses to actively produce to be your backup, and pay you our highest respect!

　　各地军民致函朝鲜军民和我志愿部队
    誓作后盾消灭美国侵略者
    帝国主义从那里来  就消灭它在那里
    敬爱的朝鲜人民军指战员全体同志们：
    喜闻您们最近在我国人民志愿部队帮助下，打了大胜仗的消息，我们是非常的高兴。因为美国鬼子曾被一时的“胜利”冲昏了头脑，妄想在短时期内征服朝鲜，进一步侵略中国。但是这个计划算在您们的铁锤之下彻头彻尾的粉碎了。
    同志们！您们正义的反侵略战争已获得了全世界爱好和平的人民的支援；特别是我们中国人民以志愿的行动参加了这个解放战争，和您们站在一起并肩作战消灭共同的敌人，确保全世界的永久和平。这一行动不仅是正当的，而且是我们的职责，抗美援朝、保家卫国是我全国人民应尽的义务，任何人也不能而且也没有权利阻挡我们的。因为我们中朝人民的友谊不是今天开始的。就拿抗日战争来说吧，您们地不分国籍，人不分种族和我们站在一起出生入死，不知流了多少血才换来了胜利，取得了和平建设的今日，这一件铁的事实我全国人民是永远也不能忘记的。但是今天美帝国主义竟又来侵略您们神圣的国土，烧杀朝鲜的同胞，抢掠您们的物资，我们是绝对不能置之不理的，我们要行动，我们要志愿杀敌，帝国主义从那里来我们就消灭他在那里。
    最后，希望我们中朝两国人民亲密团结，为早日解放朝鲜，全部干脆消灭一切敌人而胜利前进。
    战斗英雄  贺福祥
    希望你们更勇敢地杀敌  最后胜利一定属于我们
    敬爱的英勇卫国的朝鲜兄弟姊妹们：
    由于你们英勇的反侵略战争，已使美帝国主义遭受了应得的惩罚，很大的兵力，陷在泥沼里，使他不得不重新估计一下世界上爱好和平人民的力量。
    现在你们的自卫战争，在客观条件上，比我们在解放战争中优越多了，有七亿人口的中苏两大邻国已有足够的力量支援你们，还有世界上各个爱好和平的国家和人民也声援你们，这一个垂死挣扎的美帝还有什么可怕？
    中国已经掀起了抗美援朝的热潮，许多志愿军也都参加与你们并肩作战，希望你们更勇敢地杀敌，最后胜利一定是属于正义这一面的。
    这一封短短的信，是描写不出我心中的热情的，谨以至诚的信念祝你们早得胜利，全世界爱好和平的人民，将携手并进，走向和平幸福之途。
    谨致
    革命敬礼
    蚌埠市失业工人救济委员会  赵振欧
    中国人民作你们的后盾  胜利肯定属于朝鲜人民
    英勇的朝鲜人民军并中国人民抗美援朝志愿部队全体同志：
    首批中国志愿部队渡江和朝鲜人民军兄弟们并肩作战，一开始就首创大捷。我们在祖国的革命战士们听到你们的捷音，感觉无比兴奋，好像我们在解放战争中听到兄弟部队打胜仗一样的欢欣。我们知道朝鲜人民的胜利就是我们自己的胜利。我们更知道这个胜利才是胜利的开始，更大的胜利在等待着我们。美帝强盗们已感到这是对它们沉重的打击，但更惨淡的前途在等待美国法西斯。
    亲爱的兄弟们，英雄的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿部队的全体同志，我们知道朝鲜人民正在忍受着战争的严重考验，忍受着一切困难去争取反抗侵略的胜利。你们的爱国主义和国际主义的精神，构成了有我无敌的意志，打击着凶恶的敌人。你们的同志在遥远的华北向你们致以亲切的慰问，并祝你们继续争取更大的胜利！
    我们正在加紧磨刀练武，随时准备和你们共同争取反抗侵略的胜利。不仅我们如此，我全国人民，都已振奋起来了，大家站在祖国的工作岗位上突击，这支强大的后备力量，就更肯定了胜利是属于朝鲜人民的！
    你们的战友赵文彬、白烽、宫洁民
    首都四十万工人  誓作你们的后盾
    敬爱的中国人民抗美援朝志愿部队的同志们：
    你们为了保卫祖国的安全，不顾严寒，到朝鲜去，和朝鲜人民军并肩抵抗美帝的侵略，第一拳就把美国侵略军打到清川江以南，扭转了朝鲜的战局，使美帝国主义再也不敢轻视远东人民的保卫和平的力量了。你们为保卫我们的祖国而战，你们为捍卫世界和平而战，你们站在全世界反抗帝国主义侵略的最前线，你们的行动是最光荣，最崇高的，全中国和全世界的人民都在向你们致敬，以全力支援你们。
    北京市四十万工人目前正加倍努力地工作，很多工厂已经展开了热烈的爱国主义生产竞赛，在竞赛中，工友们提出了“机器当武器，工厂当战场”的口号，坚决用生产战线上的胜利支援你们。此外，北京市的工人，把加强时事学习，加强防特、防火、防空、防盗等工作作为抗美援朝保家卫国运动中的实际行动。并且，北京市有许多工友已经自愿地报名参加志愿军，准备随时奔向前方与你们共同打击敌人！

    祝你们获得更大的胜利！

    中国人民志愿部队同志们：
    当美帝国主义疯狂地侵略朝鲜，又向我国挑衅的时候，你们奋不顾身地为了人民的和平，帮助朝鲜人民，在半月之内歼灭敌军一万三千余人，夺回城市十座。你们这种为人民的正义战争，受到了广大人民的拥护和爱戴。我们在本市大众剧院召开了一百二十三名团员的时事座谈会，除向你们写信表示亲切的慰问外，我们愿以实际行动支援你们。在今后工作中我们计划要执行：（一）星期日不休息。（二）努力学习，搞好工作；财经部门谨防特务破坏，公安部门提高警惕性，加强保密工作。（三）广泛进行时事宣传。（四）精简节约，每人保证每月节省小米二斤。（五）坚决服从组织，争取赴朝参加志愿军。（六）打破太平观念，消除恐美思想。我们不仅有了计划，而且有信心在实际工作中行动起来，必要时征得组织上允许，到朝鲜和你们并肩抗敌。
