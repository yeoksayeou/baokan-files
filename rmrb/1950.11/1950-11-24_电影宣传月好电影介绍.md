　　Good Movie Recommendations for Movie Promotion Month
　　Editor's Note: To cooperate with the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country, movie theaters in Beijing are selecting famous films to add to their early morning screenings starting this morning. This newspaper will introduce the content of the films in succession.
    "Daughters of China"
　　The theme of "Daughters of China" illustrates that our Northeastern compatriots never yielded to the brutal enemy during the fourteen dark years of Japanese imperialist rule. The female heroes in the film, Leng Yun, Hu Xiuzhi... and the other eight women, are such people. For the freedom and happiness of the people, they were not afraid of hardship in the war and completely forgot about themselves. For the sake of the motherland, they dedicated all their strength and lives. This loyal integrity and indomitable character completely demonstrate the heroic spirit of the great Chinese nation.
　　Sister An – a Korean woman, who fought alongside her Chinese brothers and sisters, regarded China as her own country, because she understood that "the people on both sides of the Yalu River have the same fate. If one side of the river suffers disaster, the other side will not be happy." Sister An said: "We are never willing to be subjugated slaves, so Koreans and Chinese unite to resist Japan." Whether viewed historically or geographically, China and North Korea are inseparable, like lips and teeth. We must learn from Sister An's noble and great internationalist spirit, and only by doing so can we be true patriots.
　　American imperialism is completely following the old path of Japanese fascism, dreaming of conquering Korea, invading China, and enslaving the world. Truman, the incarnation of Hitler, has openly burned the flames of aggression against Korea to our borders. The common enemy of the Chinese and Korean people has been replaced by American imperialism. Because "if one side of the river suffers disaster, the other side will not be happy," and because the Chinese and Korean people once "united to resist Japan," we have an unshirkable duty to stand up and aid our friendly neighbor. We must act quickly like the heroes in "Daughters of China," respond to the call of the motherland, do our best, use various methods and practical actions, actively launch the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, defend our motherland, and annihilate the murderous and arsonist bandits on the spot.

　　电影宣传月好电影介绍
    编者按：京市各影院为配合抗美援朝保家卫国运动，于今晨起分别选择名片加演早场，影片内容本报将陆续加以介绍。
    “中华女儿”
    “中华女儿”的主题在说明我东北同胞在日寇统治时期十四年昏暗的岁月里，在凶暴的敌人面前从不屈服。影片里的几位女英雄冷云、胡秀芝……等八女就是这样的人。他们为了人民的自由和幸福，在战争中不怕坚苦，完全忘掉了自己，为了祖国，献出了他们全部的力量和生命。这种忠贞的气节和坚强不屈的性格，完全表现出了中华民族伟大民族的英雄气魄。
    安大姐——一位朝鲜妇女，她和中国的兄弟姊妹们一起并肩作战，把中国看成和她自己的祖国一样，因为她明白“鸭绿江两岸的人民是有着同一命运的，如果江岸一边遭到灾难，那么，隔岸也不会是幸福的”。安大姐说过：“咱们总不甘心做亡国奴，所以朝鲜人和中国人联合起来抗日”。中朝两国无论从历史上或地理上去看，都是分不开的唇齿之邦。我们要学习安大姐的崇高伟大的国际主义精神，这样做才是真正的爱国者。
    美帝国主义完全走着日本法西斯的老路，梦想着征服朝鲜，侵占中国，奴役全世界，希特勒的化身杜鲁门竟公然将侵朝的火焰燃烧到我国边境上来。中朝两国人民共同的敌人，就为美帝国主义所代替。因为“江岸的一边遭受灾难，那么，隔岸也不会幸福”，又因为中朝人民曾经“联合起来抗日”，所以我们就义不容辞，挺身而起，援助我们的友邻。就只有象《中华女儿》中的英雄们一样赶快的行动起来，响应祖国的号召，尽我们一切力量，用各种方法和实际行动，积极展开抗美援朝，捍卫祖国，把杀人放火的强盗就地消灭。
