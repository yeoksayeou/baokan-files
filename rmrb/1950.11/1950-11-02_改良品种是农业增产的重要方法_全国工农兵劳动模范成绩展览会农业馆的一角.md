    In the agricultural pavilion of the exhibition, several charts compared the yields of cotton and grain this year with those before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Taking grain as an example, the average yield from 1931 to 1936 was 280 billion jin, while this year it is 240 billion jin. The cotton production situation: 16.97 million dan in 1936, and 14 million dan this year. Although grain and cotton production has not yet reached the highest pre-war yields, it has seen a huge increase compared to 1949: grain production increased by 20 billion jin, and cotton production increased by 5.2 million dan. This shows that since the War of Resistance Against Japan, due to the devastation and destruction by the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, the production level, which had been declining for twelve years, has begun to rise on a national scale this year. This year, each person has an average of 500 jin of grain, which is enough to be self-sufficient. This year, cotton production is close to meeting the needs of the national textile industry and homemade wadding. Increasing grain and cotton production will continue to be the central issue in agricultural production in the future.
    There are many ways to increase grain and cotton production. In the exhibition hall, a complete set of new agricultural machines from cultivation to harvesting and storage are displayed. There are as many as nine types of sprayers for preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests alone. In addition, many exhibits on water conservancy and irrigation, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, land safety systems (soil and water conservation facilities), and horticultural specialties all indicate effective methods of increasing production. However, according to current economic conditions, improving varieties is still the most cost-effective method of increasing production. Therefore, the exhibits in the grain and cotton production section are arranged with this as the center.
    To understand how good or bad varieties affect yields, you can find out by looking at these exhibits and charts. The "Yin Fang Rice" from Junliangcheng in Tianjin yields 996 jin per mu this year, while ordinary rice only yields 280 jin, at most no more than 500 jin. The fact that Golden Queen corn yields 100% more than ordinary varieties is already known to many people. The results of five years of testing Si Zi No. 4 cotton in Jingyang, Shaanxi, have proven that it yields an average of 65.16% more than Xiaoyanghua (degenerated American cotton). According to surveys in various places, generally, improved grain varieties can increase production by more than 20%, and improved cotton seeds can increase production by 30%.
    A brightly colored picture reveals the characteristics of improved seeds and ordinary seeds to the audience. This is indeed a stark contrast: improved crops do not lodge, do not shed seeds, grow neatly, mature uniformly, and have high yields; the opposite picture of ordinary varieties makes the audience strongly feel the seriousness of its yield reduction. Of course, this yield reduction phenomenon is not only quantitative; the exhibits also explain it in terms of quality. Here are two samples of wheat: Xu Zhou No. 438 wheat contains 16% protein, produces 90 jin of flour per 100 jin, and is white and fine, weighing 16 jin per dou; ordinary wheat only contains 12% protein, weighs 14 jin per dou, and produces 80 jin of flour per 100 jin, which is already dark and coarse.
    The audience is very interested in the exhibits analyzing the rust (jaundice) resistance of wheat varieties. This year, wheat rust disease spread across the country, causing serious losses; originally, wheat, which was also a good variety, showed great differences. Those with strong rust resistance had about the same yield as in previous years; on the contrary, the yield was greatly reduced. Ding Xian No. 72 wheat belongs to the former, yielding 287 jin per mu last year and 265 jin this year; Bei Xi No. 3 wheat has no rust resistance, yielding 289 jin per mu last year, and a sharp decrease to 68 jin this year.
    The People's Government pays great attention to the work of improving varieties, and gives due respect to the inventions and creations of the masses. The first exhibit in the Agricultural Pavilion is the improved wheat variety Bi Ma No. 1, which was cultivated by Zhao Hongzhang, a model worker representative from the Northwest. Its characteristics are: it does not suffer from yellow jaundice, black jaundice, does not lodge, does not shed seeds, and has a high yield, which is on average 20% higher than the famous Jin Da Northwest No. 302. This is a considerable contribution to wheat production in the Northwest. A chart in the exhibition room indicates that the spread of wheat jaundice disease this year has reduced wheat production nationwide by 20% to 30%. However, there are still very few wheat varieties in China that have strong rust resistance and good quality, so Zhao Hongzhang's Bi Ma No. 1 is particularly valuable. It provides a strong guarantee for overcoming rust disease, and the government is prepared to promote it on a large scale in suitable areas.
    Naturally, large-scale variety improvement work is still carried out by organizing the masses to select seeds, which is a historic initiative in China. In the first half of this year, through the organization of seed companies in various places, the masses have selected more than 70 good varieties and carried out seed selection on more than 4 million mu of land. Many good varieties selected by the masses are displayed here, including 29 types of wheat, 9 types of rice, 19 types of millet, and 4 types each of corn, sorghum, and sweet potatoes. The exhibition made a special introduction to the deeds of Yu Qingshou, a model seed selector from Shandong. Before the wheat season in 1942, Yu Qingshou and his wife discovered five unusual wheat plants. By 1945, because they harvested 270 jin of wheat on half a mu of land, they alarmed the neighboring villages and the Wendeng County Farm, which named the wheat "Bian Sui Mai" (flat ear wheat). Now, "Bian Sui Mai" has been widely promoted in Jiaodong. Wendeng Prefecture alone planted 280,000 mu this year. Zhou Zhongfu, a farmer from Gao Village, Wendeng County, harvested 729 jin per mu from the Bian Sui Mai he planted.
    In recent years, through the efforts of the People's Government and the vast number of peasants, the work of improving varieties has made commendable achievements. This year, 19.3% of the country's cotton fields used selected good varieties, covering an area of 10.75 million mu. The grain good varieties controlled by state agencies in various provinces are enough for 19.05 million mu of land to use next year, accounting for about 1.23% of the total area of grain crops. This number is naturally still small, and more good varieties are still in the hands of the masses. In the wheat season this year alone, the masses exchanged more than 42 million jin of good varieties.

　　改良品种是农业增产的重要方法
    ——全国工农兵劳动模范成绩展览会农业馆的一角
    萧航
    在展览会的农业馆里，有几幅图表对比了今年和抗日战争前的棉粮产量。拿粮食来说，一九三一到三六年的平均产量是二千八百亿斤，今年为二千四百亿斤。棉花的生产状况：一九三六年为一千六百九十七万担，今年为一千四百万担。粮棉生产虽然还没达到战前最高产量，但比起一九四九年来，却有巨大数量的增长：粮食增产二百亿斤，棉花增产五百二十万担。这说明，从抗日战争以来，由于日寇、蒋匪的摧残破坏，十二年来一直下降着的生产水平，从今年起，全国规模地开始上升了。今年每人平均有五百斤粮食，已能自给。棉花今年已接近全国纺织工业和胎絮手纺的需要。今后增产粮棉依然是农业生产的中心问题。
    粮棉增产的方法很多。在展览馆里，陈列着从耕种到收获、储藏的整套新式农业机器，单是防治病虫害的喷雾器就有九种之多；另外，许多关于水利灌溉、畜牧兽医、土地安全制度（水土保持的设施）、园艺特产的展品，全指示着有效的增产方法。但是，按照目前经济条件，花钱少、收效大的增产方法还是改良品种。因此，粮棉增产部分的展览品，就是以此为中心来布置的。
    要知道品种好坏对于产量有怎样的影响，看了这展品和图表说明就知道了。天津军粮城的“银坊水稻”，今年每亩收九百九十六斤，普通水稻却只收二百八十斤，充其量也不过收五百斤。金皇后玉蜀黍比普通品种的产量高百分之百，这是许多人已经知道的事实。斯字四号棉在陕西泾阳试验了五年的结果，证明平均比小洋花（退化美棉）增产百分之六十五·一六。据各地调查，一般粮食的优良品种可增产百分之二十以上，改良棉种可增产三成。
    有一幅色彩鲜明的图画，把良种和普通种籽的性质揭示给了观众。这的确是一个鲜明的对比：良种作物不倒伏，不落粒，生长整齐，成熟一致，产量高；普通品种恰恰相反的画面，使观众强烈地感觉到它减产的严重性。当然，这种减产现象不单单是数量上的，陈列品还从质量上作了说明。这里有两份小麦的标本：徐州四三八号小麦，含蛋白百分之十六，每百斤出面九十斤，又白又细，每斗重十六斤；普通小麦仅含蛋白百分之十二，每斗重十四斤，每百斤出面八十斤，已经显得又黑又粗了。
    观众对分析小麦品种抗锈（黄疸）能力的展品，有着很大的兴趣。今年小麦锈病曾在全国范围内蔓延，造成严重的损失；本来同是优良品种的小麦，却显出了极大的差别。凡是抗锈能力强的，产量和往年差不多；反之，产量大减。定县七十二号小麦属前者，去年每亩收二百八十七斤，今年收二百六十五斤；北系三号小麦无抗锈能力，去年每亩收二百八十九斤，今年骤减至六十八斤。
    人民政府十分注意改良品种的工作，对群众的发明和创造，给予了应有的尊重。农业馆的第一件展品，是小麦良种碧蚂一号，这是西北劳模代表赵洪璋培育成的。它的特点是：不生黄疸、黑疸、不倒伏、不落粒，产量之大，较诸著名的金大西北三○二号还平均高出百分之二十。这对西北小麦生产的贡献，是相当大的。展览室的一张图表指明，今年小麦黄疸病的蔓延，使全国小麦减收百分之二十到三十。但是，在中国还极少抗锈力强、品质又好的小麦品种，所以赵洪璋的碧蚂一号就格外珍贵，它给战胜锈病提供了有力保证，政府准备在适应地区大量推广。
    自然，大规模的改良品种工作，还是通过组织群众选种来进行的，这是中国历史上的创举。今年上半年，经各地种子公司的组织，群众已评选出七十多种良种，在四百多万亩土地上进行了选种。这里陈列着许多群众选出的良种，计有小麦二十九种，水稻九种，粟十九种，玉蜀黍、高粱、甘薯各四种。对山东选种模范于青绶的事迹，展览会特别作了介绍。在一九四二年麦前，于青绶夫妇发现了五棵异样的小麦，到一九四五年，由于在半亩地上收获了二百七十斤小麦，惊动了邻村和文登县农场，农场并将这种小麦定名为“扁穗麦”。现在，“扁穗麦”已在胶东大量推广起来，仅文登专区今年即播种二十八万亩。文登县高村农民周忠富种的扁穗麦，每市亩收到七百二十九斤。
    几年来，经过人民政府和广大农民的努力，改良品种的工作已经有了可称赞的成绩。今年全国棉田的百分之十九·三，是选用的良种，面积达一千零七十五万亩。各省国家机关掌握的粮食良种，足够明年一千九百零五万亩土地使用，约占粮食作物总面积的百分之一·二三。这个数字自然还是很小的，更大量的良种还掌握在群众手里。单是今年麦季，群众互换良种即达四千二百余万斤。
