　　Movie Promotion Month: Good Movie Introduction
    "The Turning Point"
    "The Turning Point" is one of the outstanding works of Soviet cinema.
    "The Turning Point" depicts a great turning point: the turning point of the Soviet Patriotic War, and the turning point of the fate of people all over the world – the victory of the Battle of Stalingrad. From then on, the glory of the people will be forever preserved in human history, and the inevitable fate of the death of fascism was also confirmed.
    "The Turning Point" is about this great victory, a victory that should be attributed to the Soviet people, to the teacher of the world's people – Stalin, who guided the people to victory and won glory. "The Turning Point" shows everywhere the amazing brilliant insight of Marshal Stalin – his scientific, invincible strategic thinking and military genius. Relying on him and his leadership, the Soviet people defeated Hitler's insane invasion, proving the inviolability of the socialist proletariat's motherland.
    In "The Turning Point," there is a general, a general of the people, who comes from the people and has a flesh-and-blood connection with the people, taking the people's joys and sorrows as his own. Although he lost his loved one, he can still restrain his grief and inspire the command of the battle.
    In "The Turning Point," there are soldiers, soldiers are the armed people. For the sake of the motherland, the people's soldiers do not cherish their precious lives. For military communication, soldiers do not hesitate to use their bodies and lives to connect the telephone line for communication. The great turning point relied on them, on the people's soldiers and generals, on the heroic self-sacrificing spirit of the people's army, in a word, on the people.
    Today, when we watch "The Turning Point," we must take it as a textbook to learn the Soviet people's strong will to resist the enemy and defend their country. We must also have an "Asian Turning Point" of the people, to turn the American imperialists from Korea into the ocean. History has proven that justice must triumph over injustice.

    《大转变》
    《大转变》这部影片是苏联电影的杰出作品之一。
    《大转变》写了一个伟大的转折，苏联卫国战争的转折，全世界人民的命运的转折——斯大林格勒战役的胜利。从此，人类历史上人民的光荣将永远保存，法西斯死亡的必然命运也被证实。
    《大转变》就写了这个伟大的胜利，这个胜利应当归功于苏联人民，归功于世界人民的导师——斯大林，是他引导着人民走向胜利，赢得光荣。《大转变》中就处处表现了斯大林大元帅惊人的英明卓见——他的科学的不可战胜的战略思想和军事天才。靠了他和他的领导，苏联人民战胜了希特勒的疯狂侵略，证明了社会主义无产阶级的祖国之不可侵犯。
    《大转变》中出现的有将军，将军是人民的将军，他来自人民，与人民有血肉的联系，以人民的忧喜为自己的忧喜，他自己虽丧失爱人，仍能抑制自己悲痛，振奋指挥作战。
    《大转变》中出现有士兵，士兵是武装了的人民。为了祖国，人民的士兵都不珍惜自己宝贵的生命。为军事联系，士兵不惜用身体性命接着电话线来通话。大转变就依靠了他们，依靠了人民的士兵和将军，依靠人民军队的英雄主义的忘我牺牲，一句话，依靠了人民。
    今天我们看《大转变》，要把它作为课本，学习苏联人民誓死抗敌，保家卫国的坚强意志。我们也要有一个亚洲人民的《大转变》，把美帝由朝鲜转变到海洋中去。历史已经证明了，正义一定要战胜非正义。
