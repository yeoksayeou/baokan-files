Xinji Coal Store also continuously raised coal prices from 100 yuan per jin to 120 yuan per jin, not only exceeding the standard price of mixed briquettes, but also far exceeding the reasonable price of pure lump coal. In addition to the 300 tons of briquettes currently in stock, the store also has nearly 500 tons of lump coal, Yangquan coal, Datong coal, Changcheng coal, and Daliang bituminous coal.

　　The above-mentioned households have been investigated by the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce and are being dealt with separately.
