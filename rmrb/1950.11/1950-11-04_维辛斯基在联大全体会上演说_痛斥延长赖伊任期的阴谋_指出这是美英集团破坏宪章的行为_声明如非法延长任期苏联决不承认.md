Xinhua News Agency, New York, 2nd TASS Telegraph: On October 31, 1950, Vyshinsky delivered a speech at the UN General Assembly on the appointment of the UN Secretary-General. The text is as follows:

Vyshinsky addressed the UN General Assembly on October 31, stating: Several delegations have submitted proposals recommending extending the term of the current Secretary-General by three years. Regarding this, several representatives have spoken here, most or all of whom are proponents of this proposal, and they have cited some considerations to justify this proposal.

These considerations include legal considerations, political considerations, and considerations based on the personal merits of the current Secretary-General.

We should naturally pay attention to these three aspects and no others. But among these three aspects, legal considerations are of great importance. This consideration can directly serve as a guiding principle for all our activities, because every political decision, regardless of its content, should first be firmly based on our law—the Charter.

But the Soviet delegation believes that, from this perspective, the situation is completely unsatisfactory. In our view, the considerations cited in this legal analysis cannot withstand any criticism.

Mr. Austin said that in resolving this issue, we should use what he called "normal methods." I agree with this. Of course, abnormal methods should not be used. In resolving this issue, it is certainly necessary to adhere to normal methods. However, what is the real normal method, what method can be regarded as normal, what method has these conditions and this definition, and does the fifteen-nation proposal have the conditions of a normal method? From this point of view, let us reach an agreement, let us consider this issue.

I think it should be considered indisputable that normal methods are also methods based on the Charter. If someone proposes a method that cannot be found in the Charter, this has already raised doubts about its normality; and if someone proposes a method that directly conflicts with the Charter, this clearly proves that the proposed method is abnormal.

　　The Charter does not contain any provisions for extending the term
　　Therefore, it is impermissible to raise this issue

As has been said here before, the Charter does not contain any provisions regarding the extension of the term of any elected official—including the Secretary-General. This has been acknowledged by several representatives, even the proponents of this proposal, who said that the Charter does not contain any provisions or rules regarding the extension of the term.

I want to talk further about this issue. I want to say that the Charter does not contain this concept of extending the term. In the Charter, there is no such concept. Therefore, it is impermissible to raise the issue of applying a method that is not only not recognized by the Charter but also conflicts with the Charter. I want to explain my views and prove the correctness of my views on this issue. The Charter does not contain any provisions allowing the issue of extending the term of the Secretary-General to be raised.

But on January 24, 1946, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution. As long as it has not been rescinded, it is naturally binding on us. But, to disregard this resolution, the General Assembly must have another resolution to rescind the first resolution. And as long as this resolution has not been rescinded, it is our law.

What does the resolution of January 24, 1946, say? The resolution of January 24, 1946, says: "Section 3. The term of office of the first Secretary-General must be five years. At the end of the term, he may be reappointed to continue in office for five years."

What we are encountering now is exactly what Section 3 of the General Assembly's resolution of January 24, 1946, says.

Secretary-General Lie was appointed to serve for five years. Now, this period is about to end, because his term will expire on February 1, 1951. In this case, according to Section 3 of the resolution of January 24, 1946, he may be reappointed to continue in office for five years.

Was this section included in the resolution by accident? Here, some people have talked about the history of this issue. This history starts from San Francisco, or more precisely, from Dumbarton Oaks.

I want to talk about it on a deeper level. I want to start with the decisions or recommendations of the Preparatory Committee that drafted the Charter, which clarified the actual wishes, purposes, tasks, and interpretations regarding this issue.

Because almost everything contained in the currently implemented Charter was transferred from the drafts drafted by the Preparatory Committee to this Charter, I want to start there even more.

If we look at the documents of the Preparatory Committee, we all know that the Preparatory Committee adopted a decision that said the following.

"Section 18 - The term of office of the first Secretary-General must be five years," which is the same as what is said in Section 3 of the above-mentioned resolution of January 24, 1946.

"At the end of the term, he may be reappointed to continue in office for five years." This is also the same as what is stipulated in Section 3 of that resolution.

What else is said later? "Because the Charter does not provide for this issue, the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council may, based on accumulated experience, change the terms of office of subsequent Secretaries-General."

And this is also included in the resolution of January 24, 1946, becoming Section 4, Paragraph A, which states: "Because there is no provision for this in the Charter, the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council may, based on their experience, change the terms of office of subsequent Secretaries-General."

It must also be considered indisputable that, in accordance with Article 97 of the Charter and Rule 140 of the Rules of Procedure of the United Nations General Assembly, the United Nations General Assembly may not consider or vote on candidates not recommended by the Security Council. But here someone says: We are not dealing with the issue of appointment here, but only with the issue of extending the term.

Then, I would like to ask, where in the Charter is there any mention of extending the term? Please point out to me even the slightest hint of a provision for extending the term. In that decision of the United Nations General Assembly of January 24, 1946, which I just talked about, Section 4, Paragraph C, says "in the event of reappointment" and not "extension."

　　Whether it is reappointment or extension of term
　　Should be carried out in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the Charter

Now let us switch from legal language to ordinary language, to the language spoken by people who do not understand legal tricks.

What does "reappointment" mean? It means appointing the same person to continue in office for five years, or generally speaking, appointing the same person to continue in office for two years, three years, one year, four years, etc.

Therefore, we have a definite and specific understanding of "reappointment," reappointment can be an extension of the term or appointing the same person to continue in office, whether the term is the full term or a shortened term, and this in essence still means extending the term.

What should be done in this case? This must be done in accordance with the established procedures.

The same resolution, the same section, the same sentence of the United Nations General Assembly of January 24, 1946, determines this procedure. It says there: "In the event of reappointment, the same rules that applied to the initial appointment should be applied."

What rules applied to the initial appointment? Article 97 of the United Nations Charter stipulates: "The Secretary-General shall be appointed by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council." Rule 140 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly also stipulates: "When the Security Council makes a recommendation on the appointment of the Secretary-General, the General Assembly shall consider the recommendation made by the Security Council" and "proceed to elect" the candidate... nominated.

This is the legal analysis that can guide us to the right path. This analysis says that, in all cases, whether you argue that we are discussing the issue of reappointment here, or argue that we are discussing the issue of extending the term—that is, the issue of reappointing the same person to continue in office for a period of time—it is inevitable to invoke the procedural rules established by our law, that is, Article 97 of the Charter and Rule 140 of the Rules of Procedure.

If you want to apply the law, if you want to consider the Charter, if you do not want to use arbitrary means to please a capricious country, you must act in this way.

　　The Secretary-General must have a minimum of objectivity
　　And Lie is only a subservient servant of the US-UK group

Subsequently, Vyshinsky refuted the slander that the Soviet Union's refusal to allow Lie to serve as a candidate for UN Secretary-General was intended to "punish" Lie for the attitude he adopted on the Korean issue. Vyshinsky said that neither punishment nor any other external motive played any role in the Soviet Union's attitude, but the fact that we are dissatisfied with Mr. Lie's activities did play a role.

We have been asked here to discuss this issue in a spirit of frankness. I want to try such a spirit of frankness to explain the reasons for our dissatisfaction with Mr. Lie's activities.

We believe that the Secretary-General must at least satisfy the entire United Nations organization to the minimum extent, and not just one country or a group of countries. I intentionally say "entire"—not only the majority but also the minority, because the rights of the minority, especially in large organizations—are sacred rights.

Article 100 of our Charter states: "In the performance of their duties the Secretary-General and the staff shall not seek or receive instructions from any government or from any other authority external to the Organization. They shall refrain from any action which might reflect on their position as international officials responsible only to the Organization."

What has Lie done? What is his behavior like? To what extent can he satisfy the principled requirements stipulated in Article 100 of the Charter? Our answer to these questions is negative. We can cite some facts to prove it.

Five years ago, we did not oppose Lie as a candidate. But later, we gradually became convinced that Lie was not qualified to serve as UN Secretary-General.

New Zealand representative Berendsen said here that Lie brought his Twenty-Year Ten-Point Peace Plan back from Moscow intact. However, Berendsen forgot to say that Lie went to Moscow carrying memorandums from Washington and London, which were full of the spirit of being willing to be a servant of the United States, so that it immediately aroused people's suspicion. When this issue is to be raised for discussion and included in the agenda, the Soviet delegation will present several reasons to explain that this Twenty-Year Peace Plan is a pro-American plan, and explain that it does not take into account the interests of the entire United Nations organization, because it conforms to the interests of American aggression and expansion. The main intention of this plan is to attempt to cover up the interests of American aggression and expansion with such nice words as twenty years of peace.

We know that when the North Atlantic Treaty was formed, representatives of many countries objected, believing that this treaty undermined the United Nations. I think that the Secretary-General of our United Nations organization should have taken the correct stand at that time, and should not have supported this treaty that violates the interests of the United Nations in his activities.

Indeed, from the sources of the Atlantic Treaty and the Atlantic Alliance, the direction of their activities, and the development of their activities, what do they have to do with the UN Secretary-General? Has this issue ever appeared on the agenda of the United Nations? No.

However, why did UN Secretary-General Lie then think it was possible to come forward and openly support this aggressive treaty? The Secretary-General must have a minimum of objectivity, which the current Secretary-General does not have. He is not the Secretary-General of the United Nations, but only a docile servant of the US-UK group.

All these reasons make us have to oppose the extension of Lie's term, this extension is a violation of the Charter—the Charter does not provide for the extension of the Secretary-General's term, and I believe that the Charter did not provide for this, it is by no means accidental.

The United States is extremely appreciative and fond of Lie—this can be seen from newspapers and other various facts—therefore, the United States wants to keep him as Secretary-General for another three years.

The review of the issue of the Secretary-General's appointment here shows that the situation has now reached such a point that the United Nations is to be forced to accept Lie as a candidate for Secretary-General. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to resort to such a conspiracy as the so-called "extension" of the Secretary-General's term. The purpose of implementing this conspiracy is to appoint the Secretary-General without the recommendation of the Security Council. Although this conspiracy is a clear violation of the Charter, it is obvious that certain delegation groups forming a group under the leadership of the United States and the United Kingdom are deliberately planning to undermine the Charter.

　　If the United Nations is forced to accept the extension of Lie's term
　　The Soviet Union believes it must declare that it will not deal with him

In view of the above circumstances, the Soviet delegation believes it must make the following statement: "The issue of the UN Secretary-General has tremendous political importance. This importance is determined by the following fact: The main task that the UN has set for itself is to maintain international peace and security and to develop international friendship and cooperation. In order to conform to these lofty goals, the UN Secretary-General must be a person with some objectivity and impartiality, and not succumb to the influence and pressure of a certain government, although these governments may be powerful.

"The actual situation of the UN's work has shown that Lie cannot be said to be an objective and impartial person who can maintain independence and not succumb to these or other influences. A person like Lie can only perform his duties in some private enterprise and not in an important international organization like the UN. The fact that Lie played a two-faced trick in his work has even been secretly acknowledged by some of the delegations that are now forcing through this candidate and forcing the UN to accept him. It is now very clear that Lie has in fact become an echo of the US delegation after losing the respect and trust of many UN member states; if the UN's international authority is to be valued, this fact cannot be ignored.

"It is well known that not only the Soviet Union nominated a candidate for Secretary-General, but several other Security Council member states also nominated many candidates for Secretary-General, including: Rau (India), Malik (Lebanon), Naf (Mexico), Romulo (Philippines), etc. No one objected to these people. However, all efforts to reach an agreement on a new candidate for the position of Secretary-General have been completely undermined due to the blatant pressure exerted by the US delegation and its threat to use its veto against any candidate other than Lie.

"Therefore, some people are trying to force the UN to accept Lie as the UN Secretary-General as ordered by the United States.

"The UN Charter points out that 'The Secretary-General shall be appointed by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.' From this point of view, if there is a disagreement between the permanent members of the Security Council, or if there is no established majority in the Security Council, the Security Council must take measures in accordance with the provisions of the Charter regarding the determination of important issues in order to reach an agreement on the issue of the candidate for Secretary-General.

"Because the Soviet Union and several other countries oppose the extension of Secretary-General Lie's term; then, the attempt to force Lie into this position regardless of the UN Charter and the power of the Security Council is an act of playing with the UN and its Charter.

"The same act of playing with the UN and its Charter is the attempt to extend Lie's term by three years by bypassing the Security Council and violating its power, because this is also in direct conflict with the UN Charter.

"The Soviet delegation believes it must declare that if the United Nations is forced to accept the extension of Lie's term, the Soviet government will not deal with him due to the above circumstances and will not recognize him as the Secretary-General of the United Nations."

　　维辛斯基在联大全体会上演说
    痛斥延长赖伊任期的阴谋
    指出这是美英集团破坏宪章的行为
    声明如非法延长任期苏联决不承认
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约二日电：一九五○年十月三十一日维辛斯基在联大全体会议上就任命联合国秘书长事发表演说，原文如下：
    维辛斯基十月三十一日向联大全体会议发表演说称：若干代表团已提出提案，建议把现任秘书长的任期延长三年。关于这一点，若干代表已在此处发言，他们大部甚至全部是这个提案的提案人，他们援引一些考虑来为这个提案辩护。
    这些考虑包括法律上的考虑和政治性的考虑以及从现任秘书长的个人优点出发的考虑。
    我们自然应该注意这三个方面而不是别的方面。但在这三个方面中，法律上的考虑有很大的重要性。这一考虑可以直接作为我们全部活动的指导原则，因为每一个政治决定不管其内容如何，都应首先牢固地根据我们的法律——宪章。
    但苏联代表团认为，从这个角度看起来，情况是完全不能令人满意的。在我们看来，在这一法律分析方面所举出的考虑，是经不起任何批评的。
    奥斯汀先生说，在解决这个问题时，我们应该使用他所谓的“正常方法”。我同意这一点。当然，反常方法是不能使用的。在解决这个问题时，当然必需坚持正常方法。然而，什么是真正的正常方法、什么方法可以被视为正常方法、什么方法具有这种条件和这种定义、十五国提案所建议的方法是否有正常方法的条件。从这样的观点，让我们来获致协议，让我们来考虑这个问题吧。
    我想应该认为无可争辩，正常方法也是根据宪章的方法。如果有人提出某种方法而这种方法并不能在宪章中找到根据，这已经引起了对于它的正常性的怀疑了；而且如果有人提出某种方法而这种方法与宪章直接抵触，这就很清楚地证明，所提出的方法是不正常的。
    宪章中没有任何延长任期的规定
    因此提出这个问题是不能允许的
    正如以前在这里已经说过的一样，宪章中并没有包含任何关于延长任何当选者——包括秘书长在内——任期的规定。这一点已经获得若干代表们，甚至这个提案的提案人的承认，他们说，宪章并没有包含任何关于延长任期的规定或规则。
    我要进一步谈谈这个问题。我要说，宪章并没有包含这种延长任期的观念。在宪章中，是没有这种观念的。因此，在现在提出应用不但不为宪章承认而且与宪章相抵触的方法的问题，是不能允许的。我要说明我的观点并且证明我的观点在这个问题上的正确性。在宪章中并没有任何允许提出延长秘书长任期问题的规定。
    但是在一九四六年一月二十四日，联合国大会有一个决议。只要它没有取消，它自然就对我们有约束力。但是，要把这个决议置之不理，大会就必须有另一个决议来取消第一个决议。而只要这个决议一天没有取消，它就一天是我们的法律。
    一九四六年一月二十四日的决议中说些什么呢？一九四六年一月二十四日的决议说：“第三节。首任秘书长任期必须为五年。在满期时，得重行任命他继续任职五年”。
    我们现在所遇到的正是大会在一九四六年一月二十四日的决议第三节所说的那种情况。
    秘书长赖伊曾被任命任职五年。现在，这个期限即将告终，因为他的任期将在一九五一年二月一日满期。在这种情况下，按照一九四六年一月二十四日决议的第三节，可以重行任命他继续任职五年。
    难道这一节是偶然在决议中出现的吗？在这里，已经有人谈到这个问题的历史。这个历史是从旧金山开始的，或者更正确地说，是从顿巴敦橡树林开始的。
    我要进一层谈谈。我要从起草宪章的筹备委员会的决定或建议说起，这些决定或建议阐明了关于这个问题的实际愿望、目的、任务、和解释。
    因为差不多目前施行的宪章中所载的每一件事都是从筹备委员会所起草的草案转载到这个宪章中来的，所以我更加要从那里说起。
    假如我们查一下筹备委员会的东西，我们大家就知道筹备委员会是采取了照下面这样说法的决定的。
    “第十八节——首任秘书长的任期必须为五年”，这和上述的一九四六年一月二十四日的决议第三节中所说的一样。
    “在任期届满时，得重行任命他继续任职五年”。这也和该决议中第三节所规定的一样。
    后面又说了些什么呢？“因为宪章对于这个问题没有规定，联合国大会与安全理事会可以根据累积的经验变更后继各秘书长的任期。”
    并且这也包括在一九四六年一月二十四日的决议中，成为第四节甲款，该款称：“因为宪章中无此规定，联合国大会与安全理事会得根据它们的经验变更后继各任秘书长的任期。”
    同时也必须认为无可争辩，依照宪章第九十七条并依照联合国大会程序规则第一百四十条规定，联合国大会不得考虑或表决不是安全理事会所已推荐的候选人。但是这里却有人说：我们在这里并不是处理任命的问题而仅仅是处理延长任期的问题。
    那么，我就请问宪章中什么地方有任何谈到延和任期的话呢？请给我指出有一点点暗示这种延长任期的规定来吧。在我刚才谈的那个一九四六年一月二十四日的联合国大会的决定中，第四节丙款说“如遇重行任命”而不是说延长。
    不论是重行任命还是延长任期
    都应按照宪章规定的程序行事
    现在且让我们从法律的语言转到普通的语言，转到不通晓法律上的诡计的人们所说的语言来。
    “重行任命”意味着什么呢？这意味着任命同一个人继续任职五年，或者一般地说，任命同一个人继续任职二年，三年，一年，四年等。
    因此，我们对“重行任命”有确定而具体的了解，重行任命可以是延长任期或任命同一人继续任职，其任期或为全部任期，或为缩短的任期，而这在实质上仍意味着延长任期。
    在这一种情况时应该怎么办呢？这就必须按照已确定的程序行事。
    联合国大会一九四六年一月二十四日的同一决议，同一节，同一句话确定了这个程序。那里这样说：“在重行任命时，应该应用初次任命时所应用的同一规则。”
    在初次任命时应用什么规则呢？联合国宪章第九十七条规定：“秘书长应由大会经安全理事会之推荐委派之。”联大议事规则第一百四十条也规定了：“当安全理事会就任命秘书长问题提出建议时，联大应考虑安全理事会所提的建议”，并就……所提的候选人“进行选举”。
    这就是能够引导我们走向正确道路的法律上的分析。这个分析说，在一切场合下，不管你主张我们在这里讨论重行任命问题，还是主张我们讨论延长任期问题——即重行任命同一人继续任职一个时期的问题都不可避免地要援引我们的法律即宪章第九十七条及议事规则第一百四十条所确立的程序规则。
    如果你要应用法律，如果你要考虑宪章，如果你不要施用专横手段来取悦一个反复无常的国家，你就必须这样来行事。
    秘书长必须具有起码的客观态度
    而赖伊只是美英集团恭顺的奴仆
    随后，维辛斯基驳斥所谓苏联拒绝让赖伊充当联合国秘书长候选人，是意在“惩罚”赖伊在朝鲜问题上所采取的态度的谰言。维辛斯基说，不论惩罚或其他任何外在动机对苏联的态度都没有任何作用，不过我们不满赖伊先生的活动这一事实倒的确起了作用。
    我们在这里曾经被要求以坦白精神来讨论这个问题。我要试试这样的坦白精神来说明我们不满赖伊先生的活动的原因。
    我们认为秘书长至少必须在最低限度上使整个联合国组织，而不仅仅是某一国家或某一群国家满意。我有意说“整个”——不仅是多数并且包括少数在内，因为少数的权利，特别在庞大的组织中——是神圣的权利。
    我们的宪章第一百条说：“秘书长和办事人员执行职务时不得请求或接受本组织以外任何政府或其他当局之训示，并应避免足以妨碍其国际官员地位之行动。秘书长及办事人员专对本组织负责。”
    赖伊做了一些什么事情呢？他的行为到底如何？他到底能满足宪章第一百条所规定的原则性要求到什么程度呢？对于这些问题，我们的回答是否定的。我们可以引用一些事实来证明。
    五年以前，我们并不反对赖伊为候选人。但其后，我们渐渐深信赖伊并不够担任联合国秘书长的资格。
    新西兰代表比林德森在这里说，赖伊把他的二十年十点和平计划从莫斯科原封带回。然而比林德森却忘了说，赖伊是携带着华盛顿和伦敦的备忘录而到莫斯科去的，这个备忘录充满了甘为美国充当奴仆的精神，以致立即就引起了人们的怀疑。等到这个问题要提出讨论并列入议程的时候，苏联代表团将提出若干理由，说明这个二十年和平计划是一个亲美的计划，并说明它并未考虑到整个联合国组织的利益，因为它符合了美国的侵略和扩张利益。这个计划的主要用意就是企图以二十年和平等好听的言辞来掩盖美国的侵略与扩张利益。
    我们知道，当北大西洋公约形成的时候，许多国家的代表团提出了反对，认为这公约破坏了联合国。我以为，我们联合国组织的秘书长当时应采取正确的立场，不要在其活动中支持这个违反联合国利益的公约。
    的确，从大西洋公约和大西洋联盟的来源、它们活动的方向和它们活动的发展来看，它们和联合国秘书长到底有什么相干呢？这问题难道曾经在联合国的议程上出现过吗？没有。
    然而，为什么联合国秘书长赖伊那时认为有可能出面公开支持这个侵略性的公约呢？秘书长必须有起码的客观态度，这种客观态度是现任秘书长所没有的，他不是联合国的秘书长，而只是美英集团的百依百顺的奴仆。
    所有这些理由都使我们不得不反对延长赖伊的任期，这种延长是违反宪章的——宪章并没有规定延长秘书长的任期，而且我相信，宪章之所以没有规定这一点，决不是偶然的。
    美国对赖伊极为赏识宠爱——这从报纸及其他各种事实中可以看出的——，因此，美国想留他再任三年秘书长。
    这里对秘书长任命问题的审议说明，事态现在到了这种地步，竟至要强使联合国接受赖伊为秘书长候选人，为了达到这种目的，不惜诉诸像这种所谓“延长”秘书长任期的阴谋。施行这种阴谋的目的竟是要不经过安理会的推荐而任命秘书长。虽然这种阴谋显然违反宪章，可是，很明显的，在美英领导下组成集团的某些代表团集团却处心积虑地计划着破坏宪章。
    如果强使联合国接受延长赖伊任期
    苏联认为必须声明将不与他办交涉
    鉴于上述情况，苏联代表团认为必须作下列声明：“联合国秘书长问题具有巨大的政治重要性。这一重要性由下列事实决定：联合国为自己确定的主要任务乃是维持国际和平与安全以及发展国际间的友谊与合作。为了符合于这些崇高的目的，联合国秘书长必须是具有一些客观性公正性的人，不向某个政府的影响与压力屈服，虽然这些政府也许是有势力的。
    “联合国工作的实际情况已经表明，赖伊不能说是可以保持独立并且不向这些影响或其他影响屈服的客观的公正的人。像赖伊这样的人，只能在什么私人企业中而不能在像联合国这种重要的国际组织中履行职务。赖伊在他的工作中玩弄了两面派的把戏，这一事实甚至某些现在正逼迫通过这个候选人并强使联合国接受他的代表团也已偷偷地承认了。现在已很明白，赖伊在失去了许多联合国会员国的尊重与信任之后，已在事实上成为美国代表团的应声虫；如果联合国的国际权威要受到重视的话，这一事实是不容忽视的。
    “尽人皆知，不但苏联提出秘书长候选人而且若干其他安理会理事国也提出许多秘书长候选人，这些人就是：劳氏（印度），麦里克（黎巴嫩），纳孚（墨西哥），罗慕洛（菲律宾）等。对于这些人，并没有人提出反对。但是由于美国代表团施用了横暴的压力，以及它威胁以使用否决权反对除赖伊以外的任何其他候选人，要对秘书长一职新候选人获致协议的一切努力已被破坏无遗。
    “因此，有人正竭力强使联合国像美国所命令的那样接受赖伊充当联合国秘书长。
    “联合国宪章指出，‘秘书长应由大会经安全理事会之推荐委派之。’由此看来，如果安全理事会常任理事国之间意见有分歧，或者安全理事会中没有既定的多数时，安全理事会必须依照宪章中关于决定重要问题的规定来采取措施，以对秘书长候选人的问题获致协议。
    “因为苏联以及若干其他国家反对延长赖伊秘书长的任期；那么，不顾联合国宪章和安理会的权力，而强把赖伊安置在这一职位上的企图便是对联合国及其宪章的玩弄行为。
    “对联合国及其宪章同样的玩弄行为，是企图越过安全理事会并违犯它的权力而延长赖伊的任期三年，因为这也是与联合国宪章截然抵触的。
    “苏联代表团认为必须声明，如果强使联合国接受延长赖伊的任期，苏联政府由于上述情况将不与他办交涉并且将不承认他是联合国的秘书长。”
