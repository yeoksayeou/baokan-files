The anti-American and Aid-Korea movement in Beijing schools has entered a new stage.
	University and middle school students are actively conducting current affairs propaganda among the masses.
	Beijing Normal University and other schools have already taken action and are universally welcomed by the masses.
[Our newspaper reported] In order to inform the broad masses of citizens and suburban farmers of the American imperialists' conspiracy to expand their aggression, and to allow more people to join the torrent of resisting America and aiding Korea, university and middle school students in Beijing are actively going out to conduct propaganda. Individual departments of Peking University have already begun propaganda. The Seventh Middle School, the Third Middle School, Beijing Normal University and other schools went to the streets on the 7th and 8th. On the afternoon of the 10th, the Eighth Middle School split into two groups to conduct street propaganda and home visits. The Islamic College and all the students of Beijing Normal University also departed on the 11th and 12th respectively to conduct propaganda on the streets. On the evening of the 12th, the Literary Institute of Beijing Normal University also organized forums for housewives, pedicab drivers and vendors. Tsinghua University has also obtained the school's consent for all students to take three and a half days of leave to actively study and prepare to go to the countryside for propaganda. Since the 6th, students of the Central Academy of Fine Arts have been actively painting propaganda posters for resisting America and aiding Korea; the wall newspaper committee has also negotiated with many large stores for "shop windows", preparing to provide about 400 large-scale cartoons, maps, and statistical tables to be displayed in the "shop windows" within three days.
	Before setting out, the students themselves earnestly conducted in-depth current affairs studies. They discussed the joint declaration of the various democratic parties, studied various documents and propaganda materials, and invited experts to give reports. Their understanding of current affairs has improved a step further.
	In the preparation for propaganda, attention was paid to the actual problems among the masses and the interests of the masses. Peking University students went through the District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the police station to understand the situation of the main propaganda objects in their propaganda area, collected the information, and discussed it in the group; and combined this research with the study of documents. Beijing Normal University students collected some common problems among the citizens and brought them to the group for discussion. When Beijing Normal University practiced propaganda, they also adopted popular spoken language. As for the propaganda methods, in addition to lectures, cartoons, slogans, dramas, living newspapers, duets, dances, waist drums, Yangko dances, military music, songs, and poetry recitations, there are also quick talks, crosstalks, ventriloquism, peep shows, magic lanterns, as well as folk songs such as "Sawing the Big Vat" and "Little Shepherd Boy", and tried their best to incorporate new content into various popular folk forms.
	The propaganda focus of the Islamic College is divided into four aspects: (1) the aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism; (2) the atomic bomb is not terrible; (3) aiding Korea is precisely defending the country; (4) calling on all citizens to unite and defend the country.
	Before officially setting out, Peking University, Beijing Normal University and other schools conducted key experiments to create models and draw experience. After the thirteen propaganda teams of Beijing Normal University completed their propaganda on the evening of the 12th and returned to school, they also held review meetings to summarize their experiences and lessons.
	The propaganda of Beijing Normal University, Islamic College, the Eighth Middle School and other schools have achieved considerable results, moved many people, and have been welcomed by the masses. According to preliminary estimates, about 20,000 people participated in listening to lectures and other activities during the propaganda of Beijing Normal University on the 12th alone. The masses expressed unanimous resentment and even cursed the American imperialists and Syngman Rhee who were portrayed. When Zhao Chongming, a student from the first brigade of the Eighth Middle School, said at Qianmen Cave that "American jeeps don't know how many people they have killed in our big cities in China," an old man with a white beard and a pedicab driver standing behind him said: "This student is right! My nephew was going to buy goods for his shop and was killed by an American jeep on the road." As he spoke, tears couldn't help but flow from his eyes. Later, he firmly said: "I will definitely call my son to join the volunteer army to avenge his brother and all the Chinese people!"

	[Also News] The Head Office of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the Beijing Branch of the Friendship Association jointly went to the suburbs of Beijing from the 7th to the 10th to conduct propaganda on the Soviet Union and the resistance to America and aid Korea. Soviet films and pictures were screened and exhibited fourteen times; at the same time, current affairs lectures were given in coordination, which generally improved the masses' understanding of the Soviet Union and the demand to learn from the Soviet Union. The masses unanimously believed that: If we want to live a happy life like the Soviet people, we must take action now, resist America and aid Korea, defeat the aggressive army of American imperialism in Korea, and defend our own territory.

　　京市学校抗美援朝运动进入新阶段
    大中学生向群众展开时事宣传
    师大等校已经出动受到群众普遍欢迎
    【本报讯】为了把美帝扩大侵略的阴谋告诉给首都广大市民和郊区农民，为了让更多的人投入抗美援朝的洪流，京市大、中学生积极出外进行宣传。北大个别系级已经开始宣传。七中、三中、北师等校在七、八两日曾分别出动街头。八中十日下午，分两部分进行了街头宣传和家庭访问。回民学院和师范大学全体同学也已分别在十一日和十二日出发到街头进行宣传。师大文学院十二日晚还组织家庭妇女、三轮车工人和商贩等举行座谈。清华也已征得校方同意，全体同学请假三天半，积极学习，准备下乡宣传。中央美术学院同学从六日起，积极画抗美援朝的宣传画；壁报委员会同时和许多大商店交涉了“橱窗”，准备在三天内供给四百张左右的大幅漫画及地图、统计表等在“橱窗”内陈列。
    在出动以前，首先同学们自己都紧张地进行了深入的时事学习。讨论各民主党派联合宣言，学习各种文件和宣传资料，请专人作报告。自己对时事的认识提高了一步。
    在宣传准备中，都注意了针对群众中的实际问题，和群众的兴趣。北大同学通过中共区委会和派出所等去了解其宣传区的主要宣传对象的情况，收集起来，在小组里讨论研究；并使这种研究与学习文件结合起来。师大同学搜集了一些市民中普遍存在的问题，提到小组上讨论。北师练习宣传时，也采取了大众口语。至于宣传方式，除讲演、漫画、标语、戏剧、活报剧、双簧、舞蹈、腰鼓、秧歌、军乐、歌咏、诗朗诵外，还有快板、相声、口技、拉洋片、幻灯及锯大缸、小放牛等小调，尽量利用各种民间流行的形式，编入新的内容。
    回民学院的宣传重点分四个方面：（一）美帝侵略阴谋；（二）原子弹并不可怕；（三）援助朝鲜正是保家卫国；（四）号召全体市民团结起来，保家卫国。
    在正式出动以前，北大、师大等校都作了重点试验，以创造典型，吸取经验。师大十三个宣传队在十二日晚宣传完毕回校后，还分别开了检讨会，来总结经验教训。
    师大、回民学院、八中等校的宣传，都收到了相当的效果，感动了不少群众，受到了群众的欢迎。师大在十二日一天的宣传中，参加听讲等的群众，据初步估计约二万人左右。群众对扮演的美帝和李承晚，一致表示了愤恨甚至予以痛骂。八中第一大队赵崇明同学在前门洞里讲到“美国吉普车在我们中国大城市里不知道撞死了多少人”时，站在后面的一位白胡子老头和一个三轮车工人说：“这位同学说的可真对！我的一个侄子要去给他柜上买货，在路上就给美国吉普车撞死了。”说着，眼睛里不禁流出泪来。后来他坚决地说：“我一定叫我的儿子参加志愿部队，给他哥哥报仇，给所有的中国人报仇！”

    【又讯】中苏友好协会总会及北京市友协分会于七日至十日联合赴京市郊区进行了关于苏联情况和抗美援朝的宣传。放映和展览苏联影片及图片各十四次；同时配合作了时事讲演，普遍提高了群众对苏联的认识，和向苏联学习的要求。群众并一致认为：我们要想过像苏联人民那样幸福的日子，现在必须行动起来，实行抗美援朝，击溃美帝国主义的侵朝军队，保卫住自己的国土。（中苏友协总会）
