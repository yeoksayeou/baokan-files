[Report from this Newspaper] The entire faculty, staff, and students of Northeast People's University in Changchun City have launched a widespread and in-depth movement against American aggression over the past month. "To support Korea, defend the motherland, and contribute everything" has become not only a mass slogan, but also specifically manifested in study, propaganda, and the preparation for war support work. These days, teachers have ensured that teaching meets the needs of the situation and have collected and produced a large number of materials, charts, and graphs exposing the crimes of American imperialism and related to the political, military, and economic aspects of American imperialism and the peace and democracy camp. At the same time, they are working tirelessly with the students to carry out propaganda work.

Among the students, not only is their study life showing unprecedented unity and intensity, but also a large number of activists have emerged in propaganda work. They have created many propaganda programs centered on exposing the ferocity and incompetence of American imperialism, boosting confidence in victory, and strengthening four preventions (防空、防火、防毒、防奸). The students of the temporary class drama group, in order to rush rehearsals, did not get a good night's sleep for three or four nights, but still actively requested to perform more. Female students such as Liu Guizhen and Jing Guizhi, who were very weak and ill, always insisted on participating in off-campus activities and refused to rest.

After reading the declaration of the democratic parties on November 4, the veteran soldiers and most students, as well as some lecturers and teaching assistants studying at the school, volunteered to take up arms and rush to the front lines. In addition to this urgent desire, everyone demanded immediate action to participate in war support work and propaganda work. They actively signed up to join stretcher teams, blood transfusion teams, service teams, and propaganda teams. In one evening, more than 90% of the male students in the school signed up to join the stretcher team; the accounting department all signed up in three minutes. Female students and students with weaker bodies also insisted on carrying stretchers. Student Wu Lianfen applied to the organization four times. Female student Wang Jing said, "If you definitely don't let me participate [in the stretcher team], I will join the blood transfusion team." In order to meet the demands of the faculty, staff, and students of the whole school, service teams (including nursing teams, sewing and washing teams, and entertainment teams), blood transfusion teams, and propaganda teams were formed according to each person's situation. In the accounting department alone, out of 80 students, 58 participated in the stretcher team, 52 in the blood transfusion team, and 72 in the service team. Many people participated in all three types of work at the same time. The staff also organized themselves like the students.

Students who volunteered to carry stretchers also volunteered to take out their own bedding to cover the wounded and sick soldiers. Female student Guo Shuchun specially washed her pillow and quilt so that they could be taken out when needed.

Because the school has conducted in-depth current affairs propaganda and education in various ways and from various perspectives, and everyone has been mentally prepared for a long time, the request to participate in the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is not solely based on enthusiasm. Before this, meetings were held to estimate various difficulties and to discuss extremely detailed issues. Each department found experienced people to discuss their experiences. They discussed how to carry stretchers, how to take care of the wounded and sick, etc. They also immediately conducted practical exercises.

With a high degree of patriotism, everyone expressed on blackboards and in discussion meetings that they wanted to learn from Zhao Yiman, Danniang, Dong Cunrui, Matrosov, and Yulis. Everyone expressed that they wanted to embody revolutionary heroism in every specific action, guarantee to strive to be a model, strive to join the Party and the League, and strive for the organization to assign them arduous and glorious tasks.

　　东北人民大学抗美援朝运动深入开展
　　紧张学习积极宣传热烈准备参加战地服务周密讨论详细计划提出保证争取入党入团
    【本报讯】长春市东北人民大学全体教职员、学生，一月来展开了广泛而深入的反美侵略运动。“为支援朝鲜，保卫祖国，贡献出一切”，已不仅成为一个群众性的口号，而且已经具体表现在学习、宣传以及作好战勤准备的工作中。这些天，教师们保证了使教学适合形势需要，还搜集和制作了大批揭露美帝罪行，以及有关美帝及和平民主阵营的政治、军事、经济的各种资料图表。同时和同学们一起，不眠不休地进行着宣传工作。
    在学生中，不仅学习生活，表现了空前未有的团结、紧张，并在宣传工作中，涌现了大批积极分子。他们创作了许多以揭穿美帝凶恶无能，提高胜利信心，加强四防为中心内容的宣传节目。临时班戏剧组同学，为突击排演，三、四天晚上没有好好睡觉，但还主动要求多多出演。刘桂贞、景桂芝等身体很弱和有病的女同学，始终坚持参加校外活动，不肯休息。
    在读到了各民主党派十一月四日的宣言以后，在校学习的老战士以及多数学生，部分讲师、助教，都志愿拿起枪杆，奔向前线。除了这个迫切的意愿，所有的人，都要求立刻行动，参加战勤工作、宣传工作。纷纷报名参加担架队、输血团、服务团、宣传队。在一个晚上，全校百分之九十以上的男同学，都报名参加了担架队；会计系在三分钟的功夫都签了名。女同学和身体弱的同学也坚持着要抬担架。吴莲芬同学向组织要求了四次。女同学王境说：“一定不让我参加，我就参加输血团。”为适应全校的教职员、学生所提出的要求，根据每个人的情况，又编成了服务团（包括看护队、缝洗队、文娱队），输血团和宣传队。仅会计系一系，八十名同学中，参加担架队的有五十八名，输血团的五十二名，服务团的七十二名。很多人都同时参加了以上三种工作。职工们也和同学一样组织了起来。
    志愿参加担架的同学，并志愿拿出自己的褥被，给伤病员盖。女同学郭淑春特意洗好自己的枕头被，到用的时候，好拿出去。
    因为该校曾以各种方式，从各个角度进行了深入的时事宣传教育，同时大家在思想上早已有了准备，所以要求参加抗美援朝工作，不是单凭热情。在这以前，即曾纷纷开会，估计了各种困难情况，讨论了极细致的问题。各系找出有经验的人，座谈经验。提出担架如何抬，伤病员如何照顾等。大并马上作了实地练习。
    大家以高度爱国主义的热情，在黑板报、讨论会上，表示要学习赵一曼、丹娘、董存瑞、马特洛索夫、尤利斯。大家表示：要在每一具体的行动中，体现革命的英雄主义，保证要争取做模范，争取入党、入团，争取组织上能交给艰巨而光荣的任务。
