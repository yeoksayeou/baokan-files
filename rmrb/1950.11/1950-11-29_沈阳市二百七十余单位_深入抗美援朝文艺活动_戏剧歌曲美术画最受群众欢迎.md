　　Shenyang City's More Than 270 Units
    Deeply Involved in Artistic Activities Supporting Resistance Against U.S. Aggression and Aid to Korea
    Drama, Songs, and Art Most Popular Among the Masses
    [This newspaper dispatch] According to Northeast Daily news: Shenyang City's (including Northeast Region level stationed Shenyang agencies and organizations) artistic propaganda activities supporting Resistance Against U.S. Aggression and Aid to Korea, are being extensively and deeply developed. Participating in this artistic activity of Resistance Against U.S. Aggression and Aid to Korea, including Northeast Region level and Shenyang city various departments, are a total of two hundred seventy-four units. Among these, the vast majority of units began from the beginning of July, and since October, they have become even more active. In total, the artistic propaganda activities carried out, classified by form, number forty types, including six thousand seven hundred thirty-one creations, two thousand three hundred sixteen performance activities, six thousand three hundred forty-seven issues of blackboards, wall newspapers, and quick reports, four thousand one hundred twenty-eight reports, lectures, discussions, exhibitions, etc., with a total of six million six hundred eighty-four thousand three hundred forty-six viewers and participants (of which, the audience during performances was three million three hundred seventy-four thousand seven hundred twelve people).
    In the entire activity, the more active and prominent units were the Opera News (anti-American content accounts for 57.3%) and the opera circle (including the Art Association). Regardless of the quantity of creations, performances, or audience members, they all ranked first. The next were the Shenyang City Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Cultural Center, among which the Federation of Literary and Art Circles' creation group's anti-American content also reached more than 50%. The art group was more organized and planned, and could promptly deploy, inspect, and statistically analyze the work. They created five sets of slides (more than ten pictures per set), printed one thousand five hundred copies of three types of posters, and had huge current affairs maps and organized mobile propaganda picture publications. The Cultural Center's propaganda station in the Nanshi District was better able to connect with the masses and mobilize them to read newspapers and create current affairs paintings. The activities in the Heping District were more comprehensive in the previous period; their blackboard newspapers could, from newspapers and periodicals, succinctly extract what was needed and add multiple colored chalk illustrations, which were relatively concise and eye-catching, attracting viewers. The Northeast Library's "Anti-American Current Affairs Information Reading Room" was rich in content and had many viewers. This practice can be promoted in libraries and cultural centers in various places.
    In terms of artistic forms, the most creations were in art (including cartoons, posters, situation maps, slides, etc.), totaling more than six thousand pieces. The next was drama, with 286 pieces, followed by storytelling and singing, with 81 pieces, music with 80 pieces, and literary works with 37 pieces. Dance and yangko had only performances and no creations. From the perspective of the number of participants and the response from the masses, in addition to current affairs reports and lectures having the greatest effect and the widest scope, being able to solve ideological problems; drama, songs, and art were most welcomed by the audience. However, because the situation is developing rapidly, and it is necessary to carry out timely and in-depth propaganda, everyone feels that in the future, creation should focus on short and concise forms, such as small-scale operas, dramas, yangko operas, living newspapers, songs, cartoons, comic strips, slides, as well as storytelling forms such as drum songs, crosstalk, etc. The broad masses are in urgent need of this type of work.
    In terms of content, according to incomplete statistics from ten professional artistic groups and newspaper units, there are six types with 254 pieces. In addition to the aforementioned achievements in these writing contents, the shortcomings are that everyone feels that they are generally generalized, with many concepts, and more or less limited to slogans, not in-depth, and not systematic. This is an unavoidable phenomenon in the early stages of the movement. However, in the future, in further carrying out the artistic activities of "Resisting U.S. Aggression and Aiding Korea, Defending the Homeland," we must overcome the above shortcomings and strive to systematically and deeply establish the masses' attitude of hatred, contempt, and scorn for U.S. imperialism.
    In terms of overall creation, in the past, the leadership failed to plan and organize the broad masses and art lovers to carry out this work, and there were some sporadic and spontaneous phenomena. Therefore, it generally manifested in fewer creations, and less organization, introduction, exchange, and promotion of creations and experience, forming a situation where the bottom relies on the top, and creation cannot keep up with the needs. In the future, professional and amateur artistic groups and art lovers should be widely organized to carry out a large number of creations in an organized and planned manner. And related to creation is the untimely publication work and the existing distribution problems, which have also relatively increased the "supply falling short of demand" in creation, which urgently needs to be resolved together.

### 沈阳市二百七十余单位  深入抗美援朝文艺活动  戏剧歌曲美术画最受群众欢迎

　　沈阳市二百七十余单位
    深入抗美援朝文艺活动
    戏剧歌曲美术画最受群众欢迎
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：沈阳市（包括东北一级驻沈机关、团体）抗美援朝文艺宣传活动，正在广泛深入开展中。参加此次抗美援朝文艺活动的，包括东北一级与沈市各部门共二百七十四个单位。其中绝大多数单位系自七月初起开始，而十月以来则更为活跃。总计所进行的文艺宣传活动，按形式分类共有四十种，包括创作六千七百三十一件，演出活动二千三百十六次，黑板报、壁报、快报等六千三百四十七期，报告、讲演、座谈、展览会等四千一百二十八次，观众与参加总人数共六百六十八万四千三百四十六人（其中演出时的观众为三百三十七万四千七百十二人）。
    在整个活动中，比较活跃突出的单位，为戏曲新报（抗美内容占百分之五七·三）与戏曲界（包括艺曲协会），无论创作、演出、观众数量，均占首位。次为沈市文联与文化馆，其中文联创作组反美内容亦达百分之五十以上。美术组较有组织、有计划，对工作能及时布置、检查、统计，创作了幻灯五套（每套十余幅），印制招贴画三种一千五百幅，并有巨幅形势图及组织流动性宣传画刊。文化馆以南市区的宣传站，较能结合群众，发动群众读报、创作时事画。和平区的活动，前一时期较为全面；他们的黑板报能于报刊中，针对需要，简短摘录，并加多幅色粉笔插画，较为简明醒目，吸引观众。东北图书馆的“反美时事资料阅览室”，内容丰富，观众也很多。这在各地图书馆、文化馆中，均可推广此种做法。
    在文艺形式上，创作数量最多的为美术（包括漫画、招贴画、形势图、幻灯等），共六千余幅。其次是戏剧二八六件，再次为说唱八一件，音乐八○件，文学作品三七件。舞蹈、秧歌仅有演出无创作。从参加人数与群众反映来看，除时事报告、讲演收效最大，范围最广，能够解决思想问题外；戏剧、歌曲、美术画，最为观众所欢迎。但由于形势发展迅速，而又必须及时的深入的进行宣传，所以，大家都觉得今后在创作方面，应以短小精干的形式为主，如小型的歌剧、话剧、秧歌剧、活报、歌曲、漫画、连环画、幻灯，以及书曲方面的大鼓、相声等。广大群众亟需这一类的作品。
    在内容方面，根据十个职业文艺团体与报刊单位不完整的统计，共分六种二五四件。在这些写作内容上，除前述成绩之外，不足处是大家都感觉着一般化，概念的多，或多或少的限于口号，不深入，不系统。这在运动的初期是不可避免的现象。但在今后进一步开展“抗美援朝，保家卫国”的文艺活动中，必须克服以上缺点，力求系统的、深入的，建立群众对美帝国主义仇视、鄙视和蔑视的态度。
    在总的创作方面，过去领导上未能有计划、有组织的发动广大群众和文艺爱好者来进行这一工作，有些零星、自流现象。因而普遍表现了创作少，组织、介绍、交流、推广创作和经验也少，形成下边依赖上边，创作赶不上需要。今后应广泛的组织职业的、业余的文艺团体和文艺爱好者，有组织有计划地大量创作。而与创作相联的是出版工作的不及时和存在着的发行问题，也都相对地增加了创作上的“供不应求”，亟需一并求得解决。
