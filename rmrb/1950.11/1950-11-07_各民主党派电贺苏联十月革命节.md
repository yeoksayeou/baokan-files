[Xinhua News Agency, November 6th] The Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee today sent a telegram to Marshal Stalin congratulating him on the 33rd anniversary of the Socialist October Revolution. The telegram reads as follows:

Marshal Stalin:

We warmly celebrate the 33rd anniversary of the great Socialist October Revolution and pay our highest respects to you. The October Revolution opened up a glorious new era in human history, pointed out the path of liberation for the oppressed classes and oppressed nations of the world, and directly guided the Chinese people's liberation movement to achieve brilliant victories. We respectfully congratulate you on the success of the Soviet Union's socialist construction under your leadership and the strength of the forces led by the Soviet Union in defending world peace. We are determined to follow the Soviet Union, learn from the Soviet Union, and fight to the end to crush the US imperialist aggression against China and Asia, eliminate the war-mongers headed by the US imperialism, and strive for world people's democracy and lasting peace.

China Democratic League Congratulatory Message

[Xinhua News Agency, November 6th] Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League, and Shen Junru, Vice Chairman, sent a telegram to Marshal Stalin celebrating the 33rd anniversary of the October Revolution. The telegram reads as follows:

Marshal Stalin:

On the occasion of the 33rd anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, we extend our sincere and warm congratulations to you and the entire Soviet people. The astonishing achievements of the Soviet Union's socialist construction over the past 33 years, the great victory in the anti-fascist war, and the adherence to peace and opposition to aggression in its foreign policy have led to the unprecedented and great development of the world's cause of peace and democracy. Our Chinese people's liberation war has also achieved a glorious victory because of the inspiration and encouragement of the October Revolution. We are working hard to learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience in building the country and building our own country in peace. However, the imperialist bloc headed by US imperialism is frantically extending the flames of the war of aggression against Korea to our border, seriously threatening China's national defense. We are determined to learn from the heroic spirit of the Soviet people in resisting aggression and defending their country after the October Revolution, and strive to resist US aggression and aid Korea to defend our homes and country. We are willing to work with our friendly country, the Soviet Union, to strive for lasting world peace.

Long live the Soviet Union, the fortress of the world's peace and democracy camp!

Long live the great friendship and unity of the Chinese and Soviet nations!

                Chairman of the China Democratic League Zhang Lan
                Vice Chairman Shen Junru

Democratic National Construction Association Congratulatory Message

[Xinhua News Agency, November 6th] The China Democratic National Construction Association today sent a telegram to Marshal Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, congratulating him on the 33rd anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution. The telegram reads as follows:

To Comrade Roshen, Soviet Ambassador to China, please forward to Marshal Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Moscow:

On the occasion of the 33rd anniversary of the October Revolution, we would like to extend our warm congratulations and high, fraternal respects to you and, through you, to the working people of the entire Soviet Union on behalf of all members of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the broad masses of national industrialists and businessmen!

The great October Revolution is the clarion call for the freedom and liberation of the oppressed and enslaved people of the world and a major turning point in the history of human society. It marks the beginning of the collapse of the capitalist system and the beginning of the victory of the people of the world! Without the October Revolution and the strong establishment of the socialist state of the Soviet Union, it would have been impossible to completely defeat the three vicious imperialisms of Germany, Italy, and Japan, and the people of Southeast Europe and Germany would not have been liberated. Without the October Revolution and the Soviet Union, it would not have been easy for the Chinese people to correctly apply Marxism-Leninism to destroy the united reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and achieve a glorious victory! Without the October Revolution and the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, the strength of the oppressed people of Asia, especially the people of Vietnam and Korea, would not have grown so rapidly!

Today, the US imperialists are enemies of the people of the world. They are not only actively arming the remnants of German and Japanese fascists in an attempt to attack the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all people's democratic countries, but also supporting the colonial wars of British, French, and Dutch imperialists. At the same time, they are invading our sacred territory of Taiwan by armed force. Moreover, its flames of aggression in Korea have already reached the Sino-Korean border, directly endangering the security of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese people have accepted the experience of the Soviet people in the struggle against the armed intervention of fourteen imperialists from 1918 to 1920, and are now fighting resolutely and irreconcilably against the imperialists together with all peace-loving people in the world, especially the oppressed people of Asia! This struggle is a continuation of the October Revolution.

The people of the world have experienced the suffering of two cruel wars and have launched a vigorous movement to strive for lasting peace. However, the international bandits headed by US imperialism are unreasonable and are madly launching wars of aggression. We are convinced of what Malenkov said: "If the imperialists launch a third world war, it will mean not only the end of individual capitalist countries, but also the destruction of the entire capitalist world." The imperialists' corrupt rule will inevitably be completely destroyed by the power of the people due to the launching of war!

Let us shout:

Long live the 33rd anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution!

Long live the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the victory of the people of the world!

Long live Marshal Stalin, the flag-bearer of the worldwide peace and democracy struggle and the great leader of the people's revolution!

China Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party Congratulatory Message

[This newspaper reports] The China Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party sent a telegram to Marshal Stalin, congratulating him on the October Revolution anniversary. The telegram reads as follows:

To Comrade Roshen, Soviet Ambassador, please forward to Marshal Stalin:

We warmly celebrate the 33rd anniversary of the great Socialist October Revolution and respectfully pay our highest respects to you. The October Revolution is the beacon of liberation for the oppressed classes and oppressed people of the world. Under the wise leadership of the great teachers of mankind, Lenin and you, the October Revolution opened a splendid new chapter in human history. Due to the success of the October Revolution, the Soviet people have made incomparably glorious contributions and models to all mankind in the victorious completion of socialist construction, in the Patriotic War against German, Japanese, and Italian fascists, and in the cause of building communism.

After the October Revolution, the Soviet Union first abolished the unequal treaties with our country and helped our country in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution of 1925-1927 and the anti-Japanese national liberation war of 1937-1945. In 1950, it signed a treaty of friendship, alliance, and mutual assistance with our country. The light of the October Revolution shines all over the world and all over China. The Chinese people's revolution has achieved basic victory under the illumination of the October Revolution and under the leadership of the great people's leader Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China.

The Chinese people are enthusiastically learning from the Soviet Union's great experience in nation-building and are beginning to rebuild their own motherland. Unfortunately, just as we were engaged in peaceful construction, US imperialism launched a war of aggression against Korea, and at the same time sent a fleet to invade our country's Taiwan territorial waters, using force to interfere in our liberation of Taiwan. Recently, it has crossed the 38th parallel to expand the war, approaching our country's border, and constantly bombing our country's Northeast and Shandong coastal territories. Korea and we have a relationship of interdependence. Saving our neighbor is saving ourselves. The Chinese people are enthusiastically learning the heroic spirit of the Soviet Union's October Revolution and Patriotic War, and are determined to fight resolutely to resist US aggression and aid Korea to defend our homes and country.

We respectfully congratulate the growing development of Soviet communist construction under your leadership, the growing strength of the forces led by the Soviet Union in defending world peace, and the great victory in completely crushing imperialist aggression and striving for lasting peace for mankind.

              Central Committee of the China Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party

China Zhi Gong Party Congratulatory Message

[Xinhua News Agency, November 7th] The China Zhi Gong Party today sent a telegram to Marshal Stalin of the Soviet Union congratulating him on the 33rd anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution. The telegram reads as follows:

To Comrade Roshen, Ambassador of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to China, and all Soviet friends:

On the occasion of the 33rd anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution, we, the comrades of the China Zhi Gong Party, extend our highest respect and warmest congratulations to you!

For thirty-three years, thanks to the successive leadership of Mr. Lenin and Mr. Stalin and the efforts of the entire people of your country, the Soviet Union has repelled countless internal and external counter-revolutionary disturbances and sabotage, completed the great socialist construction, and is moving towards a new communist society. Not only is your country's national strength unprecedentedly strong, but also your country has become a strong fortress of world peace and democracy. We hereby cheer for this great festival of all mankind!

The Chinese people will never forget all the help they have received from the Soviet people. Our two great peoples will always unite and fight to the end for lasting world peace. At a time when the world is shrouded in the dark clouds of war-mongers, the Soviet Union is a beacon in the darkness.

Please accept our brotherly congratulations!

Long live the Soviet Union!

Long live Marshal Stalin!

                  China Zhi Gong Party
          Beijing, November 7, 1950

    中国民主同盟贺电
    【新华社六日讯】中国民主同盟主席张澜、副主席沈钧儒致电斯大林大元帅庆祝十月革命三十三周年纪念，电文如下：斯大林大元帅：
    欣逢伟大的十月社会主义革命三十三周年，我们谨向您及全苏联人民致诚挚热烈的祝贺。三十三年来苏联社会主义建设的惊人成就，反法西斯战争的伟大胜利，以及外交政策的坚持和平和反对侵略，使世界和平民主事业获得了空前伟大的发展，我们中国人民的解放战争，因为有了十月革命的感召与鼓励，如今亦已取得了辉煌的胜利。我们正努力学习苏联先进的建国经验，在和平中来建设自己的国家，可是以美帝为首的帝国主义集团，正在疯狂地将侵朝战火延烧到我国边境，严重威胁了中国的国防。我们誓当学习苏联人民在十月革命后反抗侵略保卫国家战争中英勇壮烈的精神，为抗美援朝保家卫国而奋斗。并愿与我们的友邦苏联共同努力为争取世界持久和平而奋斗。
    世界和平民主阵营的堡垒苏联万岁！
    中苏两大民族友好团结万岁！

    民主建国会贺电
    【新华社六日讯】中国民主建国会今日致电苏联部长会议主席斯大林大元帅庆贺苏联十月革命节三十三周年，电文如下：苏联驻华大使罗申先生请转莫斯科苏联部长会议主席斯大林大元帅：
    兹当十月革命节三十三周年纪念之日，我们愿代表中国民主建国会全体会员和广大的民族工商业者向您并通过您向全苏联的劳动人民致热烈的祝贺与崇高的、兄弟的敬礼！
    伟大的十月革命，是全世界被压迫、奴役人民自由解放的号角，是人类社会历史的重大转折点；它，标志着资本主义制度崩溃的开端，标志着全世界人民胜利的开端！没有十月革命，没有社会主义国家苏联的坚强建立，就不可能彻底击溃德意日三个凶恶的帝国主义，东南欧人民以及德意志人民就不可能获得解放。没有十月革命，没有苏联，中国人民就不容易正确地运用马克思列宁主义，以摧毁帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的联合反动统治而获得光辉的胜利！没有十月革命和中国人民革命的胜利，亚洲被压迫人民尤其是越南和朝鲜人民的力量就不会如此迅速地壮大起来！
    今天，美帝国主义者和世界人民为敌，不仅积极地武装德日法西斯余孽，企图进攻苏联、中华人民共和国和所有人民民主国家，不仅支援英法荷帝国主义者的殖民战争，而且以武装侵略我神圣领土——台湾，同时，它在朝鲜的侵略火焰已经烧到了中朝边境，直接地危害着中华人民共和国的安全。中国人民接受了苏联人民在一九一八至二零年受着十四个帝国主义者武装干涉的斗争经验，正与世界上所有爱好和平的人民尤其是亚洲被压迫人民在一道，对帝国主义者进行坚决的不可调和的斗争！这种斗争，就是十月革命的继续。
    全世界人民经历了两次残酷战争的惨痛，如火如荼地展开了争取持久和平的运动，惟独以美帝国主义为首的国际强盗们蛮不讲理，疯狂地发动侵略战争。我们确信马林科夫所说的话：“如果帝国主义者发动第三次世界大战，这就意味着不但只是个别的资本主义国家的末日，而且意味着整个资本主义世界的灭亡。”帝国主义者的腐朽统治必将因为发动战争而加速地全面地被人民的力量所彻底摧毁！
    让我们高呼：
    伟大的十月社会主义革命三十三周年万岁！
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    全世界人民胜利万岁！
    全世界和平民主斗争的旗手、伟大的人民革命领袖斯大林大元帅万岁！

    中国农工民主党贺电
    【本报讯】中国农工民主党致电斯大林大元帅，祝贺十月革命节。电文如下：苏联大使馆罗申大使敬转斯大林大元帅：
    我们热烈地庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十三周年，并敬向阁下致崇高的敬礼。十月革命是全世界被压迫阶级和被压迫人民解放的灯塔，十月革命在伟大的人类导师列宁和阁下英明的领导下，开创了人类灿烂的新历史。苏联人民由于十月革命的成功，在胜利完成社会主义的建设中，在反对德日意法西斯的卫国战争中，在建设共产主义的事业中，对全人类作了无比光辉的贡献与模范。
    苏联于十月革命后，首先废除了对我国的不平等条约帮助了我国一九二五——一九二七年反帝反封建的大革命，和一九三七年——一九四五年的抗日民族解放战争，又于一九五○年同我国签订了友好同盟互助条约，十月革命的光芒普照着全世界，普照着全中国。中国人民革命就是在十月革命的照耀下，在伟大的人民领袖毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，取得了基本的胜利。
    中国人民正热烈地学习着苏联建国的伟大经验，而开始重建自己的祖国。不幸正当我们从事和平建设的时候，美帝国主义发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，同时又派舰队侵入我国台湾领海，武力干涉我解放台湾，最近更侵越三八线，扩大战争，迫近我国国境，并不断轰炸我国东北和山东沿海领土。朝鲜和我们有唇齿相依的关系，救邻即是自救，中国人民正热烈地学习苏联十月革命和卫国战争的英勇精神，誓为抗美援朝保家卫国而坚决奋斗。
    我们敬贺在阁下领导下，苏联共产主义建设日益发展，以苏联为首的保卫世界和平力量日益强大，彻底粉碎帝国主义的侵略，争取人类持久和平的伟大胜利。
              中国农工民主党中央委员会

    中国致公党贺电
    【新华社七日讯】中国致公党今日致电苏联斯大林大元帅庆贺苏联十月革命节三十三周年。电文如下：
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟驻华大使罗申先生转斯大林大元帅和全体苏联的朋友们：
    欣逢苏联十月革命三十三周年纪念日，我们中国致公党全体同志，谨向你们致最崇高的敬意与最热烈的祝贺！
    三十三年来，由于列宁和斯大林先生先后的领导以及贵国全体人民的努力，苏联曾经击退了无数次内外反革命的扰乱与破坏，完成了伟大的社会主义的建设，并正在走向共产主义的新社会。不仅贵国的国力空前强大，同时，贵国也成为全世界和平民主的坚强堡垒。我们谨在此为这全人类的伟大节日而欢呼！
    中国人民从苏联人民所得到的一切帮助，是我们永远不忘的。我们两大国人民永远团结在一起，为全世界的持久和平而奋斗到底，而在这举世都为战争贩子们的乌云所笼罩的时候，苏联更是黑暗中的灯塔。
    请接受我们兄弟的祝贺！
    苏联万岁！
    斯大林大元帅万岁！
