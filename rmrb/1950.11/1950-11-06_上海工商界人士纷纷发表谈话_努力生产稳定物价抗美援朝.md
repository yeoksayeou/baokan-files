Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Figures Issue Statements One After Another
    Strive to Produce, Stabilize Prices, Resist America and Aid Korea
    [Report from this newspaper] According to Shanghai Xinwen Ribao (Shanghai News Daily), Shanghai industrial and commercial figures have been issuing statements one after another, calling on industrialists and businessmen to do a good job in production, stabilize prices, and resist America and aid Korea with practical actions to protect their homes and defend the country.
    A spokesman for the Federation of Industry and Commerce called on industrialists and businessmen to unite, do a good job in production, and resist American imperialist aggression.
    The Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee spokesman issued a statement that said, in brief:
    The American imperialist war of aggression against Korea is the beginning of a war of aggression against all peace-loving people in the world. It can be proven from its occupation of Taiwan, its continuous bombing and strafing of our northeastern border, and its various incidents of infringing on our shipping vessels that it is following the Tanaka Memorial's plan, replacing the Japanese imperialists' unfulfilled aggressive plot, and continuing to complete it. However, the entire international situation has already changed. The strength of the peace camp, due to the liberation of China, which accounts for a quarter of the world's population and a tenth of the world's land, has played a decisive role in inevitable victory. We have the brand-new strategic and tactical experience of the eight-year War of Resistance and the three-year War of Liberation. We are definitely not afraid of the flames of the aggressor's war burning onto our territory. But we demand peace. We want to forever exempt future generations from the killings and disasters brought about by war. Then, past experience tells us that only if we actively prepare to resist aggression can we make the aggressor have scruples before aggression, and only then can the aggressor encounter resistance after aggression and be defeated miserably. Therefore, we call on all Shanghai industrialists and businessmen to stand in their own positions, proactively unite with the labor side to do a good job in production, and prepare strength for resisting aggression. We must be vigilant at all times against enemy agents spreading rumors, tracing the source, and exposing conspiracies, in order to consolidate our people's democratic regime. We must resolutely implement government orders and policies to enhance the power of our country. Only if we unite as one and actively prepare for resistance can we achieve the goal of true peace.
    Statements by Industrial and Commercial Figures
    Hu Juewen: "Korea is our neighboring country, as closely related as lips and teeth. We cannot ignore it. Defending the New China is our responsibility. We are willing to respond to Foreign Minister Zhou's statement with action, and respond to all sectors with action, to resolutely resist America and resolutely aid Korea!"
    Rong Yiren: "Korea was just liberated from the hands of Japanese imperialism and was establishing its own peaceful and democratic country, when it was subjected to armed aggression by American imperialists. We stand on the side of justice and cannot stand idly by. Korea is China's fraternal state and also our close neighbor. When a neighbor's house is on fire, one should put it out, because if the American imperialists invade Korea today, they can invade mainland China tomorrow. In fact, there is already a trend of invading mainland China. For our safety, we should take action to stop the war. Our industrial and commercial circles must redouble their efforts in production, pay attention to prices, not listen to rumors, and fulfill our due responsibilities for resisting America and aiding Korea."
    Xie Renbing: "Resisting America and aiding Korea, protecting our homes and defending our country, is the common and urgent task of the people of the whole country. Only by vigorously assisting Korea, assisting Korea in a voluntary manner, can we reduce or even stop the American imperialists' mad aggression. Only when the entire nation unites to give the aggressors a severe blow can we guarantee the independence and security of the country. In the past, we relied on the national united front and the international anti-aggression front to defeat the Japanese invaders. In the future, we will surely be able to consolidate the steel-like patriotic united front, unite all international friends, and defeat the provocations of the United States."
    Liu Jingji: "American imperialism is deliberately expanding its aggression, and the targets are Korea, China, and Vietnam. The most serious situation at present is Korea. Premier Zhou said: 'The Chinese people will never tolerate foreign aggression, nor can they allow imperialism to肆行侵略肆行侵略 against their neighbors and ignore it.' The Korean people once assisted the Chinese revolution and fought with the Chinese people against a common enemy. Therefore, China and Korea have a revolutionary historical relationship and a mutually dependent relationship of shared interests. Therefore, in order to protect the security of our motherland, we should also resist America and aid Korea.
    We industrialists and businessmen grew up in a semi-colonial land and suffered all the aggression and oppression of imperialism. We must unite within the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union to resist countries that treat us with aggression. In this way, our country can be independent and free. With an independent and prosperous country, our industrialists and businessmen can have guarantees and have a future for development.
    We believe that under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, with the strength of the great unity of 475 million people, we will surely be able to defend peace and stop the imperialist war of aggression."
    Xiang Shuxiang: "The American bandits' war of aggression in Korea has already constituted a war of aggression against the entire Asia. Because the Sino-Korean border is only separated by a river, and because of the provocative actions of American planes blindly bombing and strafing our northeastern border, the security of our northeastern border is being seriously threatened. We must not allow the American imperialists, who have already been proven to be 'China's most vicious enemy,' to occupy Korea and enslave the Korean people. 'If the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold.' We must not stand idly by. Today, the people of the whole country share a common hatred for the American bandits. We should quickly give assistance to the Korean people, defend our motherland, ensure the security of Asia, and strike the American paper tiger."
    Mao Xiaosen: "When a neighbor's house is set on fire by thugs, what should we do? Cooperate to put it out? Or pick up our suitcases and run away? If the fire spreads, can you protect your own house? The other day, the Chen family in Tongchunfang, Fengyang Road, was robbed. Why were Tang Shuhua, a clerk at the Tongshunhe Tea House, and Feng Zhaorong willing to risk their lives to help catch the thieves? This shows that we cannot stand by and do nothing when encountering the infringement of thugs. We Chinese people love peace, but we cannot be insulted when we are subjected to violent infringement. We have the strength to protect our safety and resist violence.
    Since the American imperialists launched a frenzied aggression in Korea, world peace has been greatly threatened. Especially the recent developments are like a fire burning on our eaves, and the bandits have arrived at our door. In order to defend lasting world peace, the people of our country must unite and use the great strength of 475 million people to resolutely oppose any and all acts of aggression by American imperialists. We should further assist Korea, and at the same time, protect our homes and defend our country.
    We oppose war, we want peace, but if peace is undermined or threatened, we are not afraid of war. Our powerful people's strength can give the aggressors a merciless blow, thereby striving for peace. Especially we in the industrial and commercial circles must be very calm, strengthen the study of current affairs, not listen to rumors, not speculate, not raise prices, and do all things that benefit the enemy. We should step up production to express with practical actions that we have unlimited confidence in defeating American imperialist aggression."
    Jing Shuping: "In the past, the American imperialists consistently used flowery words to cover up their crimes of aggression, but now their hideous faces have been clearly exposed - it is they who ran to the Korean territory to fight, not the Korean people who ran to the United States to 'invade.' In the peace and democracy camp, China and Korea are closely related and interdependent. If the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold. We absolutely cannot ignore it! Moreover, we must immediately use practical actions to support the Korean people, resist American imperialist aggression, to protect our homes, defend our country, and protect our children and grandchildren's forever peaceful life."
    Yan Yaoqiu: "Our machinery industry has suffered the ravages of imperialism for many years, and the hatred is deep. Therefore, we people engaged in the machinery industry all share a common hatred for the imperialists. Not to mention the distant past, in the recent 'July 7th' Incident, when the Japanese invaders invaded us, the machinery industry, in addition to doing its best to rush to manufacture guns and cannons for our army, also took the lead in moving west when the situation temporarily reversed, preserving the country's vitality and continuing to support the war of resistance, which shows their patriotic sincerity. Now that the American imperialists are trampling on our neighbor Korea, invading our Taiwan, and deliberately undermining world peace, our machinery industry should rise up in a timely manner, absolutely abide by the leadership of the Central People's Government, and together with the people of the whole country, use a hundred times the courage and fighting spirit of the anti-Japanese war to resist American imperialist aggression with practical actions and support the Korean people's just war.
    Yang Junsheng: "The American imperialists' aggression against Korea and our Taiwan, and their deliberate attempt to expand aggression and undermine world peace, has been clearly revealed. If we show weakness to the imperialists, it will fuel their arrogance and inevitably lead to their aggression. Therefore, we can only actively prepare, show our great strength, and give the American imperialists a fatal blow to protect the peace and happiness of all mankind. Our shipbuilding industry has done its best in the national liberation war in the past. Now, in order to support the Korean people and resist American imperialist aggression, we will contribute even greater strength."

　　上海工商界人士纷纷发表谈话
    努力生产稳定物价抗美援朝
    【本报讯】据上海新闻日报消息：上海工商界纷纷发表谈话，号召工商业家搞好生产，稳定物价，以实际行动抗美援朝，保家卫国。
    工商联发言人号召工商业家团结起来，搞好生产，抵抗美帝侵略。
    上海工商业联合会筹备会发言人发表谈话略称：
    美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争，是侵略全世界爱好和平人民的战争的开始。从它侵占台湾、不断轰炸及扫射我们的东北边境和侵犯我们航海船只的各次事件中，可以得到证明，它正依照着田中奏折的计划，代替了日本帝国主义所没有完成的侵略阴谋，由它来继续完成。但整个国际形势已经转变，和平阵营的力量，已经由于占全世界四分之一的人口和十分之一的土地的中国得到了解放，起了必然胜利的决定作用。我们有八年抗战和三年解放战争的崭新的战略战术经验，我们决不怕侵略者的战火烧到我们的领土上来；但我们要求和平，我们要为世世代代的子孙永远免除战争所给予的残杀祸害，那末过去的经验告诉我们：只有我们积极准备抵抗侵略，才能使侵略者在侵略前有所顾虑，才能使侵略者在侵略后遭遇抵抗而惨败。所以，我们号召全上海的工商业家，我们要站在自己的岗位上主动团结劳方搞好生产，为抵抗侵略准备力量；我们要随时警惕匪特造谣，追寻来源，检举阴谋，以巩固我们人民民主的政权；我们要坚决执行政令政策，以增强我们国家的权力，只有我们团结一致，积极准备抵抗，我们才能达到真正和平的目的。
    工商界人士谈话
    胡厥文：“朝鲜为我国邻邦，唇齿相依，我们不能置之不理。保卫新中国，是我们的责任，我们愿以行动响应周外长声明，以行动响应各界，坚决抗美，坚决援朝！”
    荣毅仁：“朝鲜刚从日帝手中解放出来，建立自己和平民主的国家，又受到了美帝国主义者的武装侵略。我们站在正义立场，不能袖手旁观。朝鲜是中国的兄弟之邦，也是我们的近邻，邻居失火，应去扑救，因为今天美帝侵略朝鲜，明天就可侵略中国大陆，事实上已有侵略中国大陆的趋势。为了我们的安全，应以行动来制止战争。我们工商界要在生产方面，加倍努力，注意物价，不听信谣言，为抗美援朝尽我们应尽的职责。”
    谢仁冰：“抗美援朝，保家卫国，是全国人民当前共同的迫切任务。我们只有大力援助朝鲜，以志愿方式援助朝鲜，才能缩小以至制止美帝的疯狂侵略；也只有全民族团结起来，给侵略者以严重的打击，才能保障国家的独立与安全。我们过去依靠民族统一战线和国际反侵略战线，打垮了日寇；今后也必能巩固钢铁般的爱国统一战线，联合一切国际朋友，打败美国的挑衅。”
    刘靖基：“美国帝国主义蓄意扩大侵略，对象就是朝鲜、中国和越南。目前形势最严重的是朝鲜。周总理说：‘中国人民决不能容忍外国的侵略，也不能听任帝国主义对自己的邻人肆行侵略而置之不理。’朝鲜人民曾经援助过中国革命，与中国人民在一起对共同的敌人作战过的。所以中国与朝鲜有革命性的历史关系，有唇齿相依的利害关系。因此，我们为了保卫祖国的安全，也应该抗美援朝。
    我们工商业者是由半殖民地生长出来的，受尽了帝国主义的侵略和压迫，我们必须团结在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营内，反抗以侵略对待我们的国家。这样，我们的国家才能独立自由，有了独立富强的国家，我们工商业者才能有保障，才有发展的前途。
    我们相信在毛主席的英明领导之下，有四万七千五百万人民大团结的力量，一定可以保卫和平，也可以制止帝国主义的侵略战争。”
    项叔翔：“美国强盗在朝鲜的侵略战争，已经构成侵略整个亚洲的战争。由于中朝边界仅一江之隔，由于美帝飞机在东北边境上盲目轰炸扫射的挑衅行为，正严重地威胁了我国东北边境的安全。我们决不能听任业已证明为‘中国最凶恶的敌人’美帝国主义占领朝鲜，奴役朝鲜人民，‘唇亡齿寒’，我们决不能置身事外。今日全国人民对美国强盗无不同仇敌忾，我们应该赶快给朝鲜人民以援助，为捍卫祖国确保亚洲的安全，予美帝纸老虎以打击。”
    毛啸岑：“邻家被暴徒纵火，我们应该怎样办？协力扑灭呢？还是提了箱笼往外跑？火延烧开来，你自己的屋子保得住吗？前天凤阳路同春坊陈姓遭盗劫，同顺和茶庄店员唐树华、凤兆荣为什么肯奋不顾身，帮同擒盗？这说明了遭逢暴徒的侵凌不能袖手旁观、坐视不救的。我中国人民爱好和平，但遭到暴力侵凌时，我们不是可以侮辱的。我们是有力量保卫安全，反抗强暴的。
    自从美帝在朝鲜发动疯狂的侵略以来，世界和平已大感威胁。尤其最近的演变，宛如火已烧到我们的屋檐，强盗已到了我们的大门口。我全国人民为保卫世界持久和平，必须团结起来，把四亿七千五百万人民的伟大力量，来坚决反对美帝国主义者任何一切侵略行为。我们应该进一步的援助朝鲜，同时也是为了保家卫国。
    我们反对战争，我们要和平，但如和平受到破坏或威胁的时候，我们并不畏惧战争，我们强大的人民力量，可以给侵略者以无情的打击，从而争取和平。尤其是我们工商界人士，更要万分镇静，加强时事学习，不听信谣言，不作投机，哄抬物价等等一切利敌行为。我们更应该加紧生产，以实际行动表示我们有无限信心，打倒美帝的侵略。”
    经叔平：“过去美帝一贯的用花言巧语来蒙蔽它的侵略罪行，但现在它的狰狞面目已经很清楚的暴露出来了——是它跑到朝鲜国土上来打，不是朝鲜人民跑到美国去‘侵略’。在和平民主的阵营中，中朝是休戚相关的，唇亡齿寒，我们绝对不能置之不理！而且必须立即用实际行动去支援朝鲜人民，抵抗美帝侵略，来保家卫国，保卫我们子子孙孙永远的和平生活。”
    颜耀秋：“我们机器工业多年来受尽帝国主义的摧残，仇深创痛，因而我们从事机器工业的人士对于帝国主义者都是同仇敌忾的。远的不谈，近如‘七七’事变，日寇侵我，机器业除竭力为我军赶造枪炮之外，于情势暂时逆转时，又率先西迁，保存国家元气，继续支持抗战，足见爱国赤诚。今当美帝蹂躏我邻邦朝鲜，侵我台湾，蓄意破坏世界和平之际，我们机器业自当及时奋起，绝对遵从中央人民政府的领导，和全国人民在一起，以百倍于当年抗日的勇气和战志，用实际行动来抵抗美帝的侵略，并支援朝鲜人民的正义战争。
    杨俊生：“美帝国主义侵略朝鲜和我国台湾，其蓄意扩大侵略，破坏世界和平的企图，已昭然若揭。对于帝国主义者，如果我们表示畏缩，将助长其凶焰，不免遭其侵略，所以我们唯有积极准备，显示我们伟大的力量，给美帝以致命的打击，才能保卫全人类的和平与幸福。我们造船业过去在民族解放战争中曾经尽过力，如今为了支援朝鲜人民，抵抗美帝侵略，我们必将贡献出更大的力量来。”
