　　The rampant behavior of American soldiers in Shanghai during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government was hated by everyone. Using "extraterritoriality" as a shield, they could run over and kill people with military vehicles without paying for their lives, and capsize ferries on the Huangpu River, not only not rushing to save lives, but ordering the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to drag the boat owners to justice. All these crimes make the blood of every person boil, and they will not forget these blood debts!
　　At 3:00 PM on November 12, 1945, a ferry departed from Longhua, intending to reach the Binpu Township garbage beach pier. Unexpectedly, when it reached the center of the river, an American military speedboat, not following the route, capsized the ferry. More than forty people fell into the water. Except for the two boatmen and a dozen passengers who were rescued, all the others drowned. After this disaster, the American military not only did not help, but said that the ferry did not give way. The reactionary government, to please its American imperialist masters, ordered the pseudo-Shanghai County Police Bureau to detain the boat owner and boatmen of the ferry. Such unreasonable things could only be done by American imperialism and the reactionaries.
　　At 8:00 PM on March 31, 1946, near the Mitsubishi Wharf, an American military landing craft capsized the No. 3 wheel of the Hezhong Company, with two sailors and four passengers missing. The reactionary government ignored this tragedy, letting the American military who caused the accident go unpunished.
　　Anteran Luosi, a female staff member of the US Embassy's military attache office, unfamiliar with driving skills, drove car number ○3-6415 on Songpan Road, Yangshupu at high speed on February 13, 1949. Because she went in the wrong direction, she first overturned the tricycle ridden by Shi Hongtao. In addition to Shi being injured, Gao Buyun, a passenger in the car, died on the spot from serious injuries. After the accident, she still did not brake and wanted to drive away. In a panic, she continuously crashed into several other tricycles, injuring Sun Yusheng, Shen Guohuang, Hu Yihua, Wang Xuequan, and vegetable vendor Sheng Daigen. Wang Dalin was killed. In this car accident, a total of two people were killed and six injured. Afterwards, the reactionary government police bureau could not summon Anteran Luosi because she enjoyed "extraterritoriality," and the matter was dropped.
　　American military Captain Tu Lai, at 7:00 PM on August 12, 1947, drove a jeep number 15643 and did not follow the route at the intersection of Nanjing East Road and Guangxi Road, causing the tricycle number 11668 to overturn. When police officer number 3314 stepped forward, intending to take Tu Lai into the bureau, Tu Lai refused to go and offered two US dollars as a bribe, which the police officer refused. Tu Lai even dragged another police officer, number 3668, onto the car and drove away, driving straight to the entrance of No. 2 Bund on Beijing East Road, where other police officers assisted in stopping the car, rescuing police officer 3668, and taking Tu Lai to the bureau, but he was eventually released.
　　On January 10, 1948, Bent, a technician from the American consulate, was driving car number 12907 when he hit pedestrian Shen Jingfu at the entrance of Wangjia Lane on Yan'an West Road. Because Bent enjoyed "extraterritoriality," the pseudo-police chief approved: this case will not be prosecuted according to international law.
　　At 11:00 PM on October 7, 1945, an American military medium-sized jeep number 8049, near Zhejiang Road on Beijing Road, collided with China Traffic Automobile Company car number 10179 because it did not follow the route, and overturned tricycle number 5543, causing serious injuries to Hu Abing and Zhang Zhongyun. The American military driver who caused the accident only got out of the car to inspect it once, and drove away indifferently.
　　There are too many facts like the above. The Chinese people must settle this blood debt with American imperialism!

### 美帝在上海留下的血债

　　美帝在上海留下的血债
    在国民党反动政府统治时期，美国兵在上海的飞扬跋扈行为，是谁都痛恨的。他们以“治外法权”作护身符，开军车撞死人可以不偿命，在黄浦江上撞翻渡船，非但不赶紧救人性命，反命蒋匪帮将船主拖去法办，这种种罪行，使每个人民热血沸腾，不会忘记这些血债！
    一九四五年十一月十二日下午三时，有只渡船由龙华方面出发，打算到滨浦乡垃圾滩码头。不料摇到江心，突有美军小汽艇一只，不照路线行驶，致将渡船撞翻。船中四十多人落水，除两船夫与十多名渡客被救起外，余皆淹死。这件祸事，美军非惟见死不救，反说渡船不让路。反动政府为讨好美帝主子，命伪上海县警察局将渡船的船主、船夫拘去扣押，这样不讲理的事情，只有美帝和反动派才做得出。
    一九四六年三月三十一日晚上八时，在三菱码头附近，美军登陆艇将合众公司的三号轮撞翻，计水手两人，乘客四人失踪。这件惨案，反动政府置之不问，让肇祸的美军逍遥法外。
    美国大使馆武官处女职员安特兰露丝，不谙驾驶术，于一九四九年二月十三日驾着○三——六四一五号汽车，在杨树浦松潘路疾驰，因走错方向，先将石洪涛踏的三轮车撞翻，除石受伤外，车上乘客高步云当场伤重身死。肇祸后，她还不煞车想开车逃逸，在心慌意乱下，又连续将其他三轮车撞倒多辆，孙玉盛、申国黄、胡亦华、王学全及菜贩盛代根均受伤，王大林撞死。这件车祸，共撞死两人，撞伤六人。事后反动政府警察局因安特兰露丝享有“治外法权”，无法传讯，不了了之。
    美军上尉吐莱，于一九四七年八月十二日晚上七时，驾一五六四三号吉普车，在南京东路广西路口，不按路线开行，致将一一六六八号三轮车撞翻。当由三三一四号警士上前，拟将吐莱带入局内，吐莱不肯去，拿出美金两元行贿，警士拒绝。吐莱竟将另一警士三六六八号拖上车子，开着便走，直开到北京东路外滩二号门口，始由其他警士协助将该车拦阻，救出三六六八号警士，并将吐莱带局，结果释放了事。
    一九四八年一月十日有美国领事馆技术员本特，驾驶一二九○七号汽车，经过延安西路汪家弄口时，将行人沈景福撞倒，因本特享有“治外法权”，经伪警察局长批示：该案依国际公法不予起诉。
    一九四五年十月七日深晚十一时，有辆美军八○四九号中型吉普，在北京路近浙江路，因不按路线，与中国交通汽车公司一○一七九号汽车相撞，并将五五四三号三轮车撞翻，致有胡阿炳、张中云两人受重伤。该肇祸美军司机只下车巡视一过，漠不关心地开着汽车自去。
    像上面这种事实太多了，这笔血债，中国人民一定要向美帝清算！
