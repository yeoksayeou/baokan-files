　　Labor Models and Militia Heroes Lead the Way in Promoting
    Resist America, Aid Korea Movement Deep into Rural Areas
    Peasants Enthusiastically Hand Over Grain to Ensure Good Production
    [Our Newspaper] (Shanghai Liberation Daily) reports: The Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Country movement has become widespread and deeply rooted in the vast rural areas of East China. Militia heroes and production models who attended the National Labor Model Conference have played a leading role in this movement. Liu Hucheng, a female militia hero from northern Jiangsu, wrote to the Liberation Daily saying, "I want to combine my past struggle experience with the current demands of the masses to step up the organization of the militia and prepare to severely打击 (dǎ jī: strike, attack) the invading enemy." Zuo Taichuan, the "Flying Explosion King" from Shandong, is also intensifying militia training in his hometown to raise everyone's political awareness and combat skills. Agricultural models from Shandong, such as Zhang Fugui, Yu Qingshou, and Zhu Fusheng, immediately convened mass meetings in their villages for current affairs discussions upon seeing reports of the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to expand the war. Under their leadership, mass actions such as digging wells, winter plowing, sand suppression, manure accumulation, and sideline production were launched. Labor models from Zhejiang, such as Chen Shuangmu, Ren Zhangyuan, and Qiu Guanxing, also unanimously expressed their determination to lead the masses in stepping up production. The broad masses of peasants in various places are expressing their determination to resist America and aid Korea with various practical actions. For example, in Zhouqiyu Village, Yiyuan, Shandong, it rained heavily on the day of grain delivery, but the masses still sang the song "Delivering Public Grain in Heavy Rain, Defending the Country and Protecting Our Homes" and delivered the public grain in the rain. The Chen Lianzhang mutual aid team in Baijia Village, Yancheng, northern Jiangsu, held a special current affairs forum. In addition to resolving to do a good job in autumn plowing, everyone also wrote to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, putting forward four guarantees: first, guarantee good production; second, guarantee sufficient public grain delivery; third, guarantee the completion of water management tasks; and fourth, guarantee good rear area security work. In areas where land reform is underway or has been completed, resisting America and aiding Korea is combined with defending the land. At the celebration of the victory of land reform in Liancheng Township, Chengguan District, Lishui, Zhejiang, the masses unanimously shouted the slogan "Supporting Korea is defending our own land." Lou Kaile, a peasant in Daxi Township, Pujiang, Zhejiang, who had been allocated land, said, "While working hard to produce, we must always monitor the bad guys and not allow spies and secret agents to infiltrate!" What is particularly moving is that the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in various places have expressed great anger when they heard that the American devils were coming to invade our country again. Fang Wenke, Liu Xiaoshi, Cui Yifa, and others, families of soldiers in the urban area of Chaoxian County, northern Anhui, wrote letters to their sons in the army, earnestly instructing them: "You must practice martial arts well and be vigilant at all times against the invasion of the American devils, and you must defend our sacred territory." Zhang Zhigao, a soldier's family member in Zhangzhuang, on the Tongyu line in northern Jiangsu, also asked a primary school teacher to write a letter to his son, saying, "Our village has signed the peace declaration. In order to strive for peace, I hope you will consolidate national defense."

　　劳动模范民兵英雄带头推动
    华东抗美援朝运动深入农村       
    农民踊跃缴粮保证搞好生产
    【本报讯】据上海解放日报消息：抗美援朝保家卫国运动，已普遍深入于华东广大农村。出席全国劳模大会的民兵英雄及生产模范们，在这运动中起了带头作用。苏北民兵女英雄刘虎成投书解放日报说：“我要把过去的斗争经验，结合今天群众的要求，加紧组织民兵，准备给侵略的敌人以严重打击。”山东飞行爆炸大王左太传，也正在家乡加紧训练民兵，提高大家的政治觉悟和作战技术。山东农业模范张富贵、于青绶、朱富胜等，看到报上美帝扩大战争的阴谋，立即在村里召集群众进行时事座谈。在他们带领下，展开了群众性的打井、冬耕、压沙、积肥和搞副业等实际行动。浙江劳模陈双目、任樟元、邱关兴等，亦一致表示了领导群众加紧生产的决心。各地广大农民更以各种各样实际行动来表示抗美援朝的决心，如山东沂源周七峪村交粮的那天恰逢大雨，但群众仍唱着《大雨交公粮，保国卫家乡》的歌子，冒雨将公粮交齐。苏北盐城柏家村陈连章互助组特召开了一个时事座谈会，大家除决心搞好秋耕工作外，并上书毛主席朱总司令提出四大保证：第一、保证搞好生产；第二、保证交足公粮；第三、保证完成治水任务；第四、保证做好后方治安工作。正在进行土改或已完成土改的地区，更把抗美援朝和保卫土地结合起来。浙江丽水城关区联城乡的庆祝土改胜利大会上，群众一致喊出了“支援朝鲜，就是保卫自己土地”的口号。浙江浦江大溪乡分得了土地的农民楼开乐说：“我们一面努力生产，一面要随时监视坏蛋不许奸细特务混进来！”令人感动的是各地的烈军属们，当他们听到美国鬼子又要来侵犯我们的祖国时，都表示了极大的愤怒。皖北巢县城区的军属方文科，刘筱时、崔义发等都写信给在部队里的儿子们，谆谆嘱咐说：“要好好练武习艺，随时警惕着美国鬼子的进犯，一定要保卫着我们神圣的国土。”苏北通榆线上的张庄军属张志高也请小学教师写信给他的儿子说：“我们村里都在和平宣言上签了名，为了争取和平，望你们要好好巩固国防。”
