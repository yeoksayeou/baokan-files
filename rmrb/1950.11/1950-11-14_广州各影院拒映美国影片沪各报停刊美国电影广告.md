　　Guangzhou Cinemas Refuse to Show American Films; Shanghai Newspapers Stop Publishing American Movie Advertisements

　　[Our Newspaper] In the Guangzhou people's movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes, and Defend the Nation, the city's cinemas recently held a meeting and decided that from now on, they will refuse to show American films, in order to strike at the American aggressors from all sides.
　　[Another Report] The broad masses of people in Shanghai have written letters to local newspapers, demanding that the American films currently being shown in Shanghai, which poison the Chinese people, be banned, and that the publication of advertisements for American films be stopped. The newspapers believe that the demands of the broad readership are entirely correct. Nine newspaper offices, including Jiefang Daily, Xinwen Daily, Dagong Bao, Wenhui Bao, Xinmin Bao, Shanghai News (English), Labor Daily, Daba and Yibao, have issued a joint statement announcing that they have decided to stop publishing advertisements for American films and similar promotional materials, effective immediately.
