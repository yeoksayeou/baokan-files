　　The Fury of the Shanghai People
　　Lin Ji
　　No matter how Truman and Acheson, the spokesmen for American monopoly capitalists, shout and embellish America’s “civilization,” the five million people of Shanghai have their own personal experiences and indelible memories. These memories tell them: the American invaders and the Japanese invaders only differ in skin color; their obscenity, shamelessness, barbarity, cruelty, and lack of the most basic conditions expected of human beings are even worse. For people who have grown accustomed to hearing about so-called “American civilization” but have not yet had the chance to experience it firsthand, this may be difficult to imagine. But the facts are so numerous that even the family women in the alleyways, who have always turned a deaf ear to national affairs and are most adept at accepting things as they are, have now indignantly resolved to "go to the Korean front and fight the American devils (this is what Shanghainese call 'ghosts') to the death!"

　　Tang Miannan was once one of the women in Shanghai who unconditionally believed in “American civilization.” According to her, in the past, whenever anyone told her that American soldiers harassed women or raped women in the streets, she would shake her head and think it was a two-sided thing: "As long as you are upright, Americans will never be so barbaric and rude." However, on one occasion, she herself was forcibly pulled down from a vehicle. Fortunately, the American soldier dropped his hat and was busy picking it up, so she was lucky to escape being defiled. After that, she believed it; but she still thought that America was a "civilized" country and that someone could certainly stop such behavior. So she desperately wrote letters appealing. It wasn't until all the appeals sank without a trace and were ignored, and the rape incidents instead increased day by day, that she woke up. This time, upon hearing that the American aggressors were about to invade China again, she indignantly joined the mass ranks of resisting America and aiding Korea, demanding to dedicate all her strength.

　　The 100,000 rickshaw pullers of Shanghai will never forget how the American soldiers—especially those who came to Shanghai in 1945 as the "allies" who had defeated Japan—treated them. Two American soldiers took Tang Fugao's rickshaw and forced him to keep running aimlessly and endlessly. Finally, when he really couldn't pedal anymore, it angered the American soldiers, who beat him unconscious on the ground. Liu Honggen had three American soldiers in his rickshaw, couldn't pedal, and was beaten so badly that he contracted lung disease, from which he has not yet recovered. Three American soldiers took Lu Changfa's rickshaw and didn't pay. Lu argued a few words and was beaten black and blue. Chiang Kai-shek's military police helped their masters by scolding Lu for "not being sensible" and threatening him, saying, "If you come to ask for money again, it won't be America's business even if you are beaten to death!" These kinds of things, falling within the scope of fistfights and kicks, were "commonplace," countless, and "not worth mentioning" (both quoted from Chiang Kai-shek's military police at the time). On New Year's Eve in 1947, two American soldiers dragged a Chinese woman and insisted on sharing Cheng Yongfang's rickshaw. Cheng pedaled for a while and couldn't pedal anymore, so the American soldier stabbed Cheng violently three times in the chest and abdomen with a sharp knife. It took him more than half a year to be able to move, and this 25-year-old young man can no longer pull a rickshaw. Not long before, the rickshaw puller Zang Dayaozi was beaten to death by American soldiers for a similar reason, with blood flowing from his ears and nose. His younger brother, Zang Haichen, with bloodshot eyes, ran to the Bund several times to find a chance to fight the American soldiers. However, each time, large groups of robbers with loaded guns landed from the ships. Zang Haichen gritted his teeth for a while and went back to cry with his dead brother's daughter, Zang Genbao. He couldn't think of any solution.

　　Incidents of American soldiers committing violence occurred in every corner of Shanghai. In November 1945, two American soldiers jumped into the car driven by Xu Tianfu and forced him to drive from Yunnan Road to Yulin Road. When Xu expressed slight dissatisfaction, five holes were broken in his head, he was thrown out of the car, and the car was also snatched away. In the same November, a small vendor on the Bund had a gold ring, which the American soldier took and left. Yao Yuyi, who was watching, was indignant and was beaten, his face covered in blood, and several teeth were knocked out. In front of a dance hall on Changle Road, a rickshaw was damaged by American soldiers for no reason. The owner chased after the car to demand compensation, but was pushed out of the car and fell unconscious. In a bar on Nanjing Road, an American soldier drank wine but didn't pay. The bartender argued with him and was stabbed fiercely in the stomach. This American soldier didn't go far before he caught a Chinese woman. Drunk American soldiers randomly fired guns to destroy street lights, scare pedestrians, and insult women, which was a common sight on the streets of Shanghai.

　　On October 8, 1945, on Gongrong Road, American soldiers shot and killed a Chinese coolie, on the grounds that the coolie had stolen a bag of sugar. On August 27, 1947, on the US military's Landing Craft 45, American soldiers beat to death 23-year-old Chinese boatman Xu Jinfu, the reason for which is unknown. The Jeeps driven by American soldiers recklessly crashed through crowded streets every day, and no one knows how many Chinese people were crushed to death or injured. Fan Hui, a rickshaw puller in Meifang Lane, accused: In the winter of 1945, one day he was passing through Nanjing Road and saw with his own eyes an American soldier in a Jeep knocking down eight people in a row. Housewife Shen Ruili accused: Her husband was crushed to death by an American soldier's Jeep. After negotiating for many days and running countless errands, she was finally given 40 US dollars (equivalent to one-seventieth of the monthly salary of the American Lido, the then Inspector General of the Maritime Customs). "My husband is only worth 40 US dollars!" She said, crying bitterly.

　　On the Huangpu River, American warships casually overturned and damaged Chinese boats without giving compensation. During the Spring Festival of 1946, an American landing craft overturned Liu Hanjin's mud boat, and his teenage son had half his head chopped off, and his pregnant wife also sank to the bottom of the river and died. This woman had just gone to the hospital a few days ago to visit a neighbor who was injured in a boat collision, comforting him by saying that it was an "accidental event." Liu Hanjin recalled the scene of the boat collision and said: "We stood on the boat, anxious and signaling, desperately shouting. The two boats were only a few steps apart, and the rotten American sailors heard and saw us, but they deliberately crashed into us for fun!" Afterwards, he went to the US military advisory group again and again to request compensation, but to no avail. The advisory group said: "We were invited by you Chinese, and we don't care about these things." In the end, they gave him money for a coffin and that was it. Liu Hanjin is still in debt to this day in order to bury the dead.

　　No one knows exactly how many such incidents have occurred. According to Liu Hanjin, he saw with his own eyes that the letters requesting compensation were stored in three full drawers at the US military advisory group. His case was number 600-something. At that time, it had only been 100 days since the US military entered the Huangpu River. According to Song Huicheng, a policeman from the Xincheng District Police Sub-bureau who managed the traffic lights across from the International Hotel, at that time, there were more than ten incidents of American soldiers causing trouble every day in his area alone. However, the police generally did not dare to intervene. Some policemen were "out of touch with reality" and, if they intervened slightly, were also beaten. Liang Yulin, a policeman from the Zhenru Sub-bureau, was beaten half to death by six American soldiers.

　　The people of Shanghai swallowed their tears and endured humiliation, enduring grievances until liberation last year. When the American soldiers fled, the citizens cursed bitterly: "Those robbers got off cheap!" "Those beasts got off cheap!"

　　The years of accumulated hatred for the American invaders in the hearts of five million people has been ignited by the new and frantic acts of aggression by the American invaders. When the United States blatantly disregarded our repeated protests, repeatedly bombed and strafed our compatriots in Northeast China and Shandong, armed and occupied Taiwan, expanded the war of aggression against Korea, and surged towards our Northeast border, the shouts of resisting America, aiding Korea, and avenging hatred immediately erupted from every corner of Shanghai. In the streets, in the alleyways, in factories, schools, and organizations, people everywhere poured out their feelings to each other, warned each other, encouraged each other, appealed, and reminded each other to "beat to death the American robbers who have broken into our homes!" "Smash the American pig noses that have poked into our vegetable gardens!" "Beat the man-eating American sea wolves back into the sea!" Many people wrote letters to the People's Government, wrote letters to various newspapers, or went directly to them, requesting permission or asking them to introduce them to the anti-American front in Korea, to the volunteer army, to contribute all their abilities. Many mothers and wives automatically stated at mass meetings that they would send their husbands and sons to join the volunteer army to kill the enemy and avenge their hatred; they would redouble their efforts on the production front to support resistance against America, assist the People's Government in eliminating hidden American and Chiang Kai-shek special agents and bandits, and consolidate the people's revolutionary order. They demanded that American films be banned, American film advertisements be banned, jazz music be banned, and "Voice of America" be banned. They said: "Our government is really too lenient! We should be stricter with these enemy things!"

　　Among the crowds requesting to join the volunteer army and participate in war service work, there are labor heroes, ordinary workers, coolies, students, teachers, doctors, nurses, bank, railway and customs personnel, people's police, neighborhood residents, and housewives. These good people are now shouting the same slogan: "Old hatreds and new grudges must be avenged together!" "Blood debts must be paid in blood!" Zhong Mingyue, Ma Gensheng, Liang Shimin, and Jin Longshan, who returned from attending the National Labor Model Conference, all demanded to cross the Yalu River. Jin Longshan's wife and sister also demanded to participate in war service work. They said, "If we don't fight the American devils out now, our descendants will be trampled under their feet!" For the same reason, housewife Luo Shuru wanted to go to Korea with her five children to participate in the war. People who had lived in Chongqing, Qingdao, and Kunming accused the more ferocious and outrageous crimes of the American invaders that they had seen. When Xiang Yuxuan, a housewife from Penglai District, requested to participate in war service work, she said: "I want to avenge my classmate Zhang Xiuying!" Her classmate was dragged away from the counter of the Kunming State Goods Company by American soldiers, raped, and died. Recalling the scene at the time, she gritted her teeth and said: "At that time, I only regretted not having a pistol and not being able to shoot those beasts to death on the spot!" The people's police wrote letters saying: "American soldiers commit violence everywhere and don't treat Chinese people as human beings. We have seen too much of it! We want to eliminate the American robbers and never let them come in again!" Many workers recalled the tragic scene of factories closing after the "February 6th" bombing by American planes and said: "The American invaders are now going to smash our rice bowls again, but this time we won't just wait to be beaten! This time we will fight them to the death!" Pan Yurong, a worker at the French-owned Electric Power Company, whose newlywed wife was killed in the "February 6th" bombing, resolutely wants to go to the Korean front to settle the blood debt. Customs personnel said: "In the past, the customs was controlled by the United States, which specialized in stifling our national industry; we can't let the customs fall into their hands again!" Yuan Meiying, a maternal and child health worker, said: "My responsibility is to protect human health, to make people live longer and live better; but the American robbers want to destroy humanity." She requested to go to the Korean front to serve the just war to eliminate the common enemy of mankind.

　　The raging fire of the Shanghai people's hatred for America and resistance against America is burning, and no force can extinguish it. It will burn together with the fire in the hearts of peace-loving people across the country and around the world, until it burns to death those who play with fire and those who set the fire themselves!

　　上海人民的怒火
    林辑
    不管杜鲁门和艾奇逊这些美国垄断资本家的代言人们怎样嚷叫和渲染美国的“文明”，上海的五百万人民却有其亲身的体验和不能磨灭的记忆。这记忆告诉他们：美国侵略者和日本侵略者比较起来，只有肤色的不同；其下流无耻、野蛮残忍、缺乏作为人类来看的最起码条件，则是有过之而无不及。这对于听惯了所谓“美国文明”而尚未来得及亲身领教的人们，也许是很难想像的事。但事实竟如此之多，以至连历来对国事充耳不闻、最善于逆来顺受的里弄中的家庭妇女，这次也愤然下定决心，要“到朝鲜前线去，和美国赤佬（这是上海人叫“鬼”的意思）拚个死活”！
    唐勉南，曾经是上海无保留地相信“美国文明”的妇女之一。据她说，以前任何人告诉她美国兵在大街上调戏妇女、强奸妇女，她都一概摇头，认为那是双方面的事：“只要自己正派，美国人绝对不会那么野蛮无礼。”但是，有一次，她自己也被从车子上强抱了下来。幸亏美国兵掉了帽子，忙着去拣，她才侥幸逃脱，免于被污。这以后她相信了；但还以为美国是“文明”国家，一定有人可以制止这种行为。于是拚命写信呼吁。直到一切呼吁都石沉大海，不被理睬，强奸事件反而日益增多时，她清醒过来了。这次听到美国侵略者又要来侵略中国，她愤然加入了抗美援朝的群众行列，要求献出自己的一切力量。
    上海十万蹬三轮的苦力工人，永远不会忘记美国兵——尤其是一九四五年以战胜日本的“盟主”资格来到上海的美国兵是怎样对待他们的。两个美国兵坐了汤富高的车子，逼着他无目标、无时间地一直蹬着跑。最后实在蹬不动了，惹得美国兵生了气，把他打昏在地上。刘鸿根一个车上坐了三个美国兵，蹬不动，被打得得了肺病，至今不愈。三个美国兵坐了陆长发的车子不给钱，陆争辩了几句，被打的头青脸肿。蒋家宪兵帮着主子责骂陆“不懂事”，并威吓说，“以后你再来要钱，打死也不关美国的事”！这类属于拳打脚踢范围的是“家常小事”，既数不清，也“不值得提”（均引当时蒋家宪兵语）。一九四七年元旦夜里，两个美国兵拖着一个中国女人硬要同坐程永芳的车子。程蹬了一段蹬不动，美国兵竟用尖刀在程的胸腹间猛刺三刀，养了半年多才能动弹，这个二十五岁的青年，现在已经不能再蹬车了。前此不远，蹬三轮的臧大咬子因类似情节，被美国兵打得耳鼻流血，死于非命。其弟臧海臣睁着血红的眼睛，几次跑到黄浦江边找机会和美国兵拚。但是，每次下船登陆的都是荷枪实弹的大群强盗。臧海臣咬一阵牙，回去和亡兄的女儿臧根宝对哭一阵。想不出任何办法。
    美国兵行凶的事件，发生在上海各个角落。一九四五年十一月间，两个美国兵跳上徐天福开的汽车，逼着他从云南路开到榆林路。徐稍表不满，头上被打破五个洞，摔到车下，汽车也被抢走了。同年十一月，外滩一个小贩有只金戒，美国兵拿了就走。旁观的姚毓义打不平，被打得满脸流血，牙齿也打落好几个。在长乐路一家跳舞场门前，一辆人力车被美国兵无故破坏了。车主追到汽车上要求赔偿，被推下车来，摔得不省人事。在南京路酒吧间，一个美国兵喝了酒不给钱。卖酒的和他理论，肚子上被狠刺一刀。这个美国兵走了没多远，又捉住了中国女人。喝醉酒的美国兵随便开枪打毁路灯，吓唬行人，侮辱女性，是上海马路上司空见愤的事。
    一九四五年十月八日，在共荣路上，美国兵用枪打死一个中国苦力，理由是说这个苦力偷了一包糖。一九四七年八月二十七日，在美军四十五号登陆艇上，美国兵打死二十三岁的中国船工徐金福，原因不知是什么。美国兵坐的吉普车每天在行人拥挤的街道上横冲直撞，轧死轧伤的中国人不知有多少。梅芳里蹬三轮的范挥控诉：一九四五年冬季，有一天他从南京路通过，亲眼看见美国兵坐着的一辆吉普车一连撞倒八个人。家庭妇女沈瑞丽控诉：她的丈夫被美国兵的吉普活活轧死。交涉了好多天，不知跑了多少路，最后给了四十元美金（相当于当时海关总税务司美国人李度的月薪七十分之一）。“我丈夫就值四十美金呀！”她说着说着就痛哭起来。
    在黄浦江上，美国的舰艇随便撞翻撞坏中国船，不给赔偿。一九四六年春节，美国登陆艇把刘汉金的泥船撞翻，十几岁的儿子被削掉半个脑袋，怀孕的妻子也沉到江底死了。这个女人前两天还到医院看望一个撞船受伤的邻人，安尉他说这是“偶然事件”。刘汉金回忆着撞船时的情景说：“我们站在船上，急得又打招呼，又拚命喊叫。两船相隔几步远，美国烂水手是听见了也看见了的，他们就是故意撞着玩！”事后他到美军顾问团三番五次请求抚恤，毫无结果。顾问团说：“我们是你们中国请来的，这些事我们不管。”最后给了一个棺材钱完事。刘汉金为着安葬死者，至今负债未清。
    以上这类事件究竟发生过多少，谁也不得而知。据刘汉金说，他亲眼看见要求抚恤的信件，在美军顾问团存着满满三大抽屉。他这一件是第六百多号。当时离美军进入黄浦江不过一百天。据新成区警察分局在国际饭店对面管理红绿灯的警士宋惠澄说，当时光在他的地段内，美国兵肇祸事件每天总有十多起。但是，警察们一般是不敢过问的。有的警察“不识时务”，稍加过问，自己也同样挨了打。真茹分局警士梁玉麟，曾被六个美国兵打到半死。
    上海的人们就这样饮泪吞声、忍辱含冤，一直挨到去年解放。美国兵逃跑了，市民们切齿痛骂：“便宜了这伙强盗！”“便宜了这群畜牲！”
    蕴蓄在五百万人民心底的对美国侵略者的多年积恨，被美国侵略者新的疯狂侵略行动点燃了。当美国悍然不睬我国多次抗议，连继轰炸扫射我东北与山东同胞，武装侵占台湾，扩大侵朝战争，向我东北国界汹涌推进时，抗美援朝、报仇雪恨的吼声立即从上海各个角落迸发出来。大街上，弄堂里，工厂学校和机关团体里，人们到处互相倾诉，互相警告，互相激励，呼吁，提醒，要“把闯上门来的美国强盗打死！”“把伸进菜园来的美国猪鼻子打烂！”“把吃人的美国海狼打到海里去！”许多人写信给人民政府，写信给各家报馆，或者直接跑去，要求允许他们或介绍他们到朝鲜的抗美前线去，到志愿部队中去，贡献自己的一切能力。许多母亲和妻子在群众会议上自动申明，要送自己的丈夫、儿子去参加志愿部队杀敌报仇；自己要在生产战线上加倍努力，支援抗美，协助人民政府肃清暗藏的美蒋特务匪徒，巩固人民的革命秩序。他们要求禁映美国影片，禁登美国电影广告，禁放爵士音乐，禁收“美国之音”。他们说：“我们政府真是太宽大了！对这些敌人的东西应该再严厉些！”
    要求参加志愿部队和参加战勤工作的人群中，有劳动英雄，也有普通工人，苦力，学生，教师，医生，护士，银行、铁路和海关人员，人民警察，里弄居民，家庭妇女。这些善良的人民，现在都喊着同一的口号：“旧恨新仇一齐报！”“血债要用血来还！”出席全国劳模会议归来的钟明月、马根生、粱石民、金龙山，都要求过鸭绿江去。金龙山的妻与妹，跟着也要求去参加战勤工作。她们说：“现在不把美国赤佬拚出去，我们子孙后代都得被他们踩在脚底下！”为着同一理由，家庭妇女罗淑如要和五个孩子一齐去朝鲜参战。在重庆、青岛、昆明住过的人，控诉着自己看到过的更加凶残、更加放肆的美国侵略者的滔天罪恶。蓬莱区家庭妇女向玉萱要求参加战勤工作时说：“我要为我的同学张秀英报仇！”她的同学，是在昆明国货公司的柜台里被美国兵拖走强奸死去的。回忆着当时的情景，她咬牙切齿说：“当时我只恨没有手枪，不能当场打死那些禽兽！”人民警察们写信说：“美国兵到处行凶，不把中国人当人看待，我们看见得太多了！我们要去消灭美国强盗，决不让它们再进来！”许多工人回忆着“二六”美机轰炸后工厂关门时的惨景说：“美国侵略者现在又要来砸我们的饭碗，这回可不再等着挨啦！这回要去拚掉他们！”法商电力公司工人潘裕龙，新婚的妻子在“二六”轰炸时被炸死了，他坚决要去朝鲜前线算血账。海关人员说：“过去海关掌握在美国手里，专门扼杀本国工业；现在不能再让海关落到他们手里去！”妇婴保健工作者袁美英说：“我的职责是保健人类，让人类活得长，过得好；美国强盗却要毁灭人类。”她要求到朝鲜前线去，为消灭人类公敌的正义抗战服务。
    上海人民仇美抗美的烈火正在燃烧，没有什么力量能够把它浇灭。它将和全国全世界和平人民心里的烈火烧在一起，直到把玩火者引火者自己烧死！
