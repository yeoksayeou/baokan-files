Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 19th (TASS): At the afternoon session of the Second World Peace Congress on the 17th, Nenni delivered a report on launching extensive activities to prohibit war propaganda, ban atomic weapons, universally reduce armaments, and establish control mechanisms to supervise the implementation of these measures.

Nenni began by stating: Our first congress was held in Paris in April 1949, two weeks before the signing of the Atlantic Pact in Washington.

I said in my report on this matter: First, the signing of the Atlantic Pact marked a split in the unity of Europe and the world, thereby leading to a crisis in the United Nations; second, since war is a policy before it becomes a military fact, it is necessary to regard the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council as the political headquarters for preparing the Third World War; third, the arms race and the principle of interfering in internal affairs, unanimously agreed upon by the signatories of the Atlantic Pact, created a long-term threat of war.

It has been twenty months since the last congress, and now we are gathered in Warsaw again.

What is the situation today? War is no longer just a danger or a policy issue. War has become a fact, with bloodshed engulfing Korea, turning it into ruins, and directly threatening China. At the same time, the people of Asia in Indochina, Malaya, and Burma have risen up against imperialism.

The doctrine of interference in internal affairs is being implemented in Korea, exacerbating the crisis of the United Nations, because the intervention is being carried out under the banner of the United Nations and clearly violates the United Nations Charter signed in San Francisco.

It is said that the Atlantic Pact is based on a non-military political agreement and does not have automatic implementation provisions. However, since September of this year, this pact has become a military alliance in the form of a unified Atlantic army, which is now under the command of the US Supreme Command.

Due to the conversion of American peacetime industry to a wartime basis and the rearmament plans of West Germany, the rearmament movement has entered a new stage.

Each fact I have listed has far-reaching consequences. The intervention in Korea has raised new questions for those Asian nations whose national, political, and economic independence is threatened; this is especially true for China, as the war is currently taking place on its borders.

Rearmament has forced the Atlantic group of countries to sacrifice social reforms, improvements in the people's living standards, and unfinished recovery; the result is the intensification of social struggles within each country.

In particular, the rearmament of West Germany has raised some issues that will have very significant repercussions. First, there is the internal problem of Germany, because the revival of the Wehrmacht will place the Bonn government under the control of former soldiers and neo-Nazis, making democratic development in West Germany impossible. Second, there is the security issue for Germany's neighboring countries, especially Poland, Czechoslovakia, and France. Finally, this is a European issue, because Europe has a great stake in the unification of Germany, as long as this unification is carried out on the basis of purging Nazism and democracy.

In general, democratic freedoms have once again come under threat in both the Americas and Europe. As we foresaw at the Paris Congress, the arms race and the war preparation policy have brewed fascist dangers everywhere.

I believe that among us representatives attending the Second World Peace Congress, there is complete agreement on the assessment of the current situation and the need to strengthen our actions. In view of the current situation being full of dangers, and these dangers being very serious, it is necessary to strengthen our actions.

We have the necessary strength to do this, because our organization has grown in proportion to the increase in the threat of a new war.

We may need to freely and openly compare our opinions on the various direct causes of the current international situation.

In my report to the Paris Congress, I pointed out that the cause of the world crisis was the Anglo-American refusal to abide by the Yalta and Potsdam agreements and the systematic undermining of the United Nations, causing it to lose its original form as it was established in San Francisco. I believe that we can now better understand the errors of the US's so-called "containment" policy, which is the cause of the United Nations crisis and the wider world crisis. The "containment" policy of the US State Department is by no means intended to "contain" the so-called "expansionism" of the Soviet Union and democratic China, which they insist would endanger the United States and its allies. Such an event has never existed and does not exist now. The US State Department is primarily trying to protect itself, and opposing the national liberation movements in colonial and semi-colonial countries, and opposing the democratic social movements in various countries.

Therefore, they eventually began to regard the anti-fascist struggle (such as the struggle made by the Czechoslovak people in February 1948, the conflict between North and South Korea, and the anti-imperialist uprising in Vietnam) as well as simple class movements (such as the recent strike in Austria) as armed aggression.

In our peace movement, we certainly have different assessments of all these struggles. For the sake of peace, we have reached an agreement on the principle of declaring non-interference in the internal affairs of various countries. This is extremely important. Mediating the Korean issue is within the jurisdiction of the United Nations, but carrying out armed intervention in violation of international law and the Charter signed in San Francisco is beyond its jurisdiction. The Charter in Chapter 1, Article 2, Paragraph 7 does not authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state.

We must state very clearly that no ideological, religious, national, social, political or economic reasons can be used as an excuse for military intervention in the internal affairs of any country.

The Second World Peace Congress is convened on the basis of the five-point proposal from Prague. The congress must make decisions on these five points item by item, and submit these decisions to world opinion, the United Nations and the governments of various countries for consideration as a basis for discussion and a means of restoring confidence in peace. These five points are:

(1) Prohibition of atomic weapons

The unprecedented success of the signature campaign for the Stockholm Appeal has shown the extent to which international public opinion supports our initiative on the prohibition of atomic weapons and the control of the use of atomic energy for military purposes. It seems necessary to extend the prohibition and control to bacteriological weapons and generally to all war tools that constitute a threat to the mass destruction of humanity.

(2) Universal reduction of all armaments and supervision of the implementation of this measure

The congress must more firmly than ever emphasize the obvious contradiction between peace negotiations and the arms race. Rearmament does not create, but destroys all possibilities for discussing and comparing opposing interests and theories. Rearmament arising from the psychology of relying on force will force the world to submit to the decision of force. Because it creates these economic and political consequences in every country, it weakens democracy, creates the threat of fascism, and diverts the powerful tools created by human genius and labor for the material and cultural well-being of the people to the path of destruction.

(3) Exposing all instances of aggression and opposing armed intervention in the internal affairs of the people

Discussions on this key issue have caused in the past and may still cause ambiguous results in the future. This ambiguity is the most dangerous. If it is declared again that all armed intervention is aggression, regardless of the purpose and circumstances of such intervention, then the congress will make a great contribution to the world.

(4) Peaceful resolution of the Korean conflict in accordance with procedures consistent with the United Nations Charter

The decision proposed by the Prague meeting of the Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress in a spirit of reconciliation remains valid, although the situation has been seriously aggravated by the invasion forces crossing the 38th parallel and directly threatening China, and the world faces the threat of an expanded conflict. Under the current circumstances, the decision that conforms to the Charter and spirit of the United Nations and the interests of peace, as a prerequisite, requires a cessation of the war, a joint discussion of the entire issue with China, and the prompt holding of elections in Korea without any external interference.

(5) Prohibition of any propaganda encouraging war in any country

The current international situation is characterized by the re-adoption of means of instigating war which were known before the Second World War due to the activities of the Nazis and fascists. In our country, we once again see propaganda speeches full of the spirit of hatred typical of the Nazi era in the newspapers. The congress must prescribe specific measures to curb this evil propaganda that may have a harmful impact on international public opinion.

As a prerequisite, the following points are essential: First, we believe that different political and social systems—Soviet democracy or people's democracy and parliamentary democracy, socialism and capitalism—can coexist and cooperate peacefully. Moreover, these two systems not only coexisted not long ago, they even cooperated in the most serious crisis in modern history—the period when Nazi fascism invaded world democracy. Second, we are willing to do our best to strive for economic cooperation and cultural and political exchanges between all peoples of the East and the West, regardless of their religious, philosophical, social or political beliefs. Third, we hope to discuss, and only hope to have discussions that can establish the truth. Peace cannot be established without discussions and agreements between nations and countries with different ideological, political and social orientations.

From this point of view, we recognize that we constitute a great force, and we know that the number of people who advocate peace far exceeds the number we represent at our great Warsaw Peace Congress. This number far exceeds the 500 million men and women who have already signed the Stockholm Appeal.

We know that, in essence, even those who believe the slander and malicious propaganda against our movement agree with our program. That is why we have come across a new problem, which is to seek a possibility to meet and have sincere discussions with the organizations of any other peace movement, and even to seek this possibility beyond the organized cooperation we hope for, regardless of whether these organizations are the International Red Cross, religious groups against war, the British Peace Committee, the Movement for Establishing a World Federal Government Association led by the great Einstein, the United Nations Association World Federation, or other peace organizations. In the World Peace Committee elected at the congress later, some vacancies must be reserved for representatives from various parties who are willing to lay the foundation for constructive discussions with us.

Another issue that should attract the attention of the congress is the crisis of the United Nations. We exposed in Paris a systematic attempt to make the United Nations no longer a world organization and to turn it into a diplomatic tool of American policy based on the Truman Doctrine. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization itself is incompatible with the provisions of the Charter signed in San Francisco. Since that time, the activities to undermine the United Nations have progressed greatly, so that now, as Nehru pointed out, the United Nations has merely become an appendage of the North Atlantic Alliance. Due to the adoption of Acheson's plan, the United Nations is moving towards an even more serious crisis, weakening the Security Council based on the principle of unanimity among the five major powers, and closing the door to China, thereby giving a major blow to the cause of peace. The congress must mobilize the great force it represents to prevent the destruction of the Charter signed in San Francisco. The United Nations will not regain its prestige and moral authority unless it truly embodies the will of the people of all countries. The years ahead of us will be the most difficult days for mankind. Our era is an era with great contradictions. In this era, the war factors and the more significant peace factors that we have just analyzed conflict with each other. Among the great peace factors, our movement plays a huge role. Moreover, the fact that peace advocates lead several powerful countries with hundreds of millions of people has completely changed our prospects.

The amazing action of our Second Congress enabling two thousand representatives to reach Poland from Britain and France within three days proves that the movement to defend peace is no longer a mere ideological movement, but has developed into a force that must be taken seriously. We must use tireless propaganda and action to make this force serve our ideals and our will to defend peace. Therefore, our task is to expose the criminals who are preparing for another war, and to oppose their policies with the will of the people we represent to defend life and peace.

Whether in the general masses, or in legislative bodies, governments, and the United Nations, we must take the initiative in discussing general issues, and when necessary, in dealing with issues that are related to the interests of this or that country. Therefore, it is necessary for the congress to give instructions to our movement, so that our decisions can gain widespread support among the broad masses of the people, expand the basis for our propaganda and activities, and then submit our decisions to the United Nations as a constructive factor in carrying out discussions and cooperation in the efforts to organize peace.

Nenni concluded: The task of the previous congress was to overcome the underestimation of the danger of war in international public opinion. During the preparation for the second congress, our task was different, which is: we must overcome the tendency to think that war is predestined and unavoidable.

This congress vividly shows that: on the one hand, we have successfully exposed the warmongers and overcome the lethargy and indifference that they rely on to stifle international public opinion; on the other hand, thanks to our propaganda, the people of the world know that they must contribute to building the edifice of peace. Nenni emphasized: Therefore, we have very definitely and concretely become the "sixth great power," and we must make it serve peace, and it itself is the hope of mankind.

### 南尼在二届世界和大的报告

　　南尼在二届世界和大的报告
    【新华社讯】塔斯社华沙十九日电：在第二届世界保卫和平大会十七日下午会议上，南尼发表了关于开展广泛活动以禁止战争宣传、禁止原子武器、普遍裁减军备及建立管制机构监督执行这些措施的报告。
    南尼首称：我们的第一届大会是一九四九年四月在巴黎召开的，是在大西洋公约在华盛顿签字前两周召开的。
    我曾在我就此事所作的报告说过：第一，大西洋公约的签订标志着欧洲及全世界团结的分裂，从而招致联合国的危机；第二，既然战争在尚未成为军事性质的事实之前是一种政策，所以有必要认为北大西洋联盟理事会乃是准备第三次世界大战的政治总部；第三，军备运动及大西洋公约签字国所一致协议的干涉内政的原则造成了长期的战争威胁。
    自上届大会以来已有二十个月了，现在我们又在华沙集会了。
    今天的局势怎样呢？战争已不再仅仅是危险或者政策问题了。战争已成为事实，战争用鲜血淹没着朝鲜，使朝鲜变成了废墟，并且直接威胁着中国，同时，印度支那、马来亚与缅甸等地的亚洲人民已经奋起反抗帝国主义。
    干涉内政的主义是在使联合国的危机恶化的情况下在朝鲜实行的，因为干涉是在联合国的旗帜下进行，而且显然破坏了在旧金山签订的联合国宪章。
    据说，大西洋公约是以非军事性的政治协议为基础的，也没有自动实施的规定，可是，自今年九月以来，这个公约已经成了以统一的大西洋军队的形式出现的军事联盟，这支军队现已归美国最高统帅部统辖。
    由于美国平时工业之转入战时基础和西德的重整军备计划，重整军备运动已进入了新的阶段。
    我所列举的每一件事实都产生了意义深远的后果。对朝鲜的干涉已在民族、政治和经济独立受到危险的那些亚洲民族面前提出了新的问题；这特别是指中国来说，因为战争目前正在她的边境进行。
    重整军备已使得大西洋集团国家不得不牺牲社会改革、人民生活水准的改善和尚未完成的恢复；结果是每个国家内部社会斗争的剧烈化。
    特别是西德的重整军备，已引起了一些会有十分重大反响的问题。这首先是德国的内部问题，因为国防军的复活将把波恩政府置于以前的军人和新希特勒分子的控制之下，并使西德的民主发展成为不可能。其次，这是德国各邻国，特别是波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和法国等国的安全问题。最后，这也是一个欧洲问题，因为欧洲是与德国的统一有着极大利害关系的，只要这种统一是在肃清纳粹以及民主的基础上实行的话。
    一般说来，无论在美洲和欧洲，民主的自由权利已再度遭受威胁。与我们在巴黎大会上所预见的相同，军备运动和备战政策已在各地酿成了法西斯危险。
    我认为在我们出席第二届世界保卫和平大会的代表们中间，对于目前局势的估计和加强我们的行动的必要性，意见是完全一致的。鉴于目前局势充满着危险而这些危险又是非常严重的，因此加强我们的行动是必要的了。
    我们有作这件事所必需的力量，因为我们的组织已随着新战争威胁的增长而相应地壮大了。
    我们也许需要自由而公开地比较一下我们对于造成国际现势的种种直接原因的意见。
    我在巴黎大会的报告中曾指出：世界危机的原因，乃是英美拒绝遵守雅尔塔和波茨坦协定，并有计划地破坏联合国，使它失去它在旧金山成立时的原样。我相信我们现在能够更好地了解美国的所谓“抑制”政策的错误，这种政策就是造成联合国危机的原因，也是造成更广大的世界危机的原因。美国国务院的“抑制”政策，绝非打算“抑制”他们硬说是会危及美国及其盟国的所谓苏联和民主中国的“扩张主义”。这种事件从来没有存在过，现在也不存在。美国国务院首先是要拚力保障它自己，而反对殖民地和半殖民地的民族解放运动，反对各国民主的社会运动。
    因此，最后他们就开始把反法西斯的斗争，（例如捷克斯洛伐克人民一九四八年二月所作的斗争，北朝鲜和南朝鲜的冲突，越南的反帝国主义的起义）以及单纯的阶级运动（例如奥地利最近发生的罢工），看作是武装侵略。
    在我们和平运动中，我们对于这一切斗争，当然有不同的估价。为了和平的利益，我们已就宣布不干涉各国内政的原则获得了协议。这是极端重要的。出面调停朝鲜问题是联合国权限以内的事情，但是违犯国际法和在旧金山签订的宪章而实行武装干涉则是它的权限以外的事情。宪章在第一章第二条第七项中并未授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家内政的事件。
    我们必须十分明确地声明：任何思想、宗教、民族、社会、政治或经济性质的理由都不能作为对任何国家内政实行军事干涉的借口。
    第二届世界保卫和平大会是在布拉格五点建议的基础上召开的。大会必须就这五点，逐项作出决定，并把这些决定提交全世界舆论、联合国及各国政府考虑，作为讨论的基础和恢复对和平的信心的手段。这五点就是：
    （一）禁止原子武器
    为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名运动的空前成功已经表明国际舆论拥护我们关于禁止原子武器与管制为军事目的利用原子能的倡议到了什么程度。看来有必要把禁止与管制扩大施用于细菌武器并一般地扩大施用于一切构成大规模毁灭人类之威胁的战争工具。
    （二）普遍裁减各种军备和监督这一措施的实施
    大会必须比任何时候都更加坚决地强调指出和平谈判与军备竞赛间的显明的矛盾。重整军备不能创造、而是破坏一切就相反的利益与理论加以讨论与比较的可能性。从凭借武力的心理产生的重整军备将使世界不得不服从武力的决定。因为它在每个国家内造成这些经济上与政治上的后果，它就削弱了民主，造成了法西斯主义的威胁并把人类的天才与劳动为了人民的物质上与文化上的幸福而创造的强有力的工具，引向了毁灭之途。
    （三）揭露一切地方发生的侵略并反对武装干涉人民的内政
    关于这一主要问题的讨论在过去曾经引起而且在将来还可能引起含糊其词的结果。这种含糊其词是最有危险性的。如果再度宣布，凡是武装干涉就是侵略，不管这种干涉的目的及情况如何，那么大会对世界就会有很大的贡献。
    （四）按照符合联合国宪章的程序和平解决朝鲜冲突
    世界保卫和平大会常设委员会执行局布拉格会议，以和解的精神所提出的决定仍然有效，虽然由于进犯军越过三八线而直接威胁中国，已使局势已经严重化，世界面临着冲突扩大的威胁。在目前的情况下，符合联合国的宪章与精神及和平的利益的决定，作为一个先决条件，所要求的是停止战争，与中国共同讨论整个问题，从速在朝鲜举行无任何外力干涉的选举。
    （五）禁止任何国家内种种鼓励战争的宣传
    目前国际局势的特点是重新采用了在第二次世界大战以前由于纳粹与法西斯分子的活动而闻名的鼓动战争的手段。在我们的国家，我们再度从报纸上看到充满纳粹时代所特有的憎恨精神的宣传演说。大会必须规定具体的办法，来制止这种可能对国际舆论发生有害影响的罪恶宣传。
    作为先决条件，下列各点是必不可少的：第一，我们相信彼此不同的政治与社会制度——苏维埃民主或人民民主与议会民主，社会主义与资本主义——可以和平共存与合作。而且，这两种制度不仅在不久以前共存过，它们在现代史上最严重的危机的时期——在纳粹法西斯侵略世界民主的时期甚至还合作过。第二，我们愿意尽力争取东方与西方之间的一切人民之间的经济合作与文化政治的交流，而不问其宗教、哲学、社会或政治信仰如何。第三，我们希望讨论，而且只希望有能够确立真理的讨论。没有思想、政治与社会方向不同的民族与国家之间的讨论与协议，便不能建立和平。
    从这个观点出发，我们认识到我们构成了伟大的力量，而且我们知道，主张和平的人数大大地超过了我们在我们伟大的华沙保卫和平大会上所代表的数字。这个数字大大地超过了已经在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名的五万万男女。
    我们知道，实质上即使那些相信反对我们运动的诽谤和恶意宣传的人也都赞同我们的纲领。这就是为什么我们碰到了一个新问题，就是要觅致一种可能性，来与任何其他和平运动的组织集会并作恳挚的讨论，甚至在我们所希望的有组织的合作接触以外来觅致这种可能，不管这些组织是国际红十字会、反对战争的宗教团体、英国和平委员会、以伟大的爱因斯坦为首的建立世界联邦政府运动协会、联合国同志会世界联合会，还是其他的和平组织。以后大会中选出的世界保卫和平委员会中，一定要保留一些空位，以待各个愿意与我们共同来奠定建设性讨论基础的代表们参加。
    还有一个应该引起大会注意的问题，就是联合国的危机。我们在巴黎已经揭露过一种有系统的企图，即：使联合国不成其为世界组织并使之变成以杜鲁门主义为基础的美国政策的外交工具。北大西洋公约本身就与在旧金山签订的宪章的条款不相容的。自从那个时候以来，破坏联合国的活动大为进展，以至于到现在正如尼赫鲁所指出的，联合国已仅仅变成了北大西洋联盟的附属品了。由于通过了艾奇逊的计划，联合国就走向甚至更加严重的危机，削弱了以五大国一致的原则为基础的安全理事会，对中国闭门不纳，从而给了和平事业一个重大的打击。大会必须动员它所代表的巨大力量来防止破坏在旧金山签订的宪章。联合国除非真正体现各国人民的意志，便不会重新获得它的威望和道义权威的。摆在我们面前的年月将是人类最感困难的日子。我们的时代是有着巨大矛盾的时代。在这个时代里，我们刚刚分析过的战争因素和意义更为重大的和平因素互相冲突着。在伟大的和平因素中，我们的运动起着巨大的作用。而且和平拥护者领导着拥有亿万人民的若干强国这一事实，已完全改变了我们的前景。
    我们的第二届大会使两千代表能够在三天之内从英国和法国到达波兰这一惊人的行动，证明了保卫和平运动已经不是单纯的思想运动，而是已经发展成为必须予以重视的力量了。我们要通过不倦的宣传和行动来使这种力量为我们的理想和保卫和平的意志服务。因此，我们的任务是：揭露准备另一次战争的罪犯们，并用我们所代表的人民保卫生命与和平的意志，来反对罪犯们的政策。
    不论是在一般群众中，或在立法机关、政府和联合国中，在讨论一般性问题上，而且遇有必要时，在处理与这一些、与那一些国家有利害关系的问题上，我们都要采取主动。因此，大会有必要对我们的运动提出指示，使我们的决定在广大的人民群众中获得普遍的拥护，扩大我们进行宣传与活动的基础，然后向联合国提出我们的决定。作为在组织和平的努力中进行讨论与合作的建设性因素。
    南尼结语称：上届大会的任务曾经是克服国际舆论对于战争危险的过低估计。在第二届大会筹备期间，我们的任务已有不同，这就是：必须克服认为战争是命定发生而不可避免的倾向。
    本届大会生动地表现出：一方面我们已经成功地揭露了战争贩子而且克服了他们所赖以窒息国际舆论的死气沉沉与漠不关心的现象；另一方面，由于我们的宣传，全世界人民都知道必须贡献力量，来建立和平的大厦。南尼着重称：因此，我们已十分确实而具体地变成了“第六强国”，我们要使它为和平而服务，而且它本身就是人类的希望。
