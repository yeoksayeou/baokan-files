　　[This Newspaper] News: The industrial and commercial circles of Beijing are actively launching the Resist-America, Aid-Korea, Protect-Home-and-Defend-the-Nation Movement. After the various trade associations issued a declaration to the industrial and commercial circles, they are now holding membership meetings or forums to discuss current events and study how to resist America and aid Korea with practical actions that practice the five "Patriotic Pledges" and consolidate the economic front. As of the 11th, the mechanized flour industry, the cinema industry, the trade industry, the bicycle industry, the soy sauce industry, the oil, salt, and vinegar industry, the stone powder industry, and the foreign wine and soda industry have held gatherings. The meetings unanimously agreed that since liberation, especially after the government's unified financial and economic work and price stabilization this spring, various industries are gradually moving towards improvement and development. The US imperialists' expansion of the war of aggression is an attempt to return to rule the Chinese people, monopolize the Chinese market, and destroy Chinese national industry and commerce. Industrialists and businessmen must resolutely resist, unite with the people of the whole country to protect their homes and defend the country, and smash the US imperialists' aggressive ambitions. At the general meeting of the mechanized flour industry, the deputy manager of the Wei Yi Flour Mill said: In order to dump surplus flour products, the US imperialists, in the name of relief before liberation, poured "Lilang" and "Hongguang" flour into our market in large quantities. As a result, our factories closed down, workers lost their jobs, and production could not be maintained. In the year and ten months since liberation, the flour industry in Beijing has been greatly developed, and the number of factories, employees, machine grinding units, and monthly flour production have more than doubled compared with before liberation. In order to defend our peaceful economic construction and resist the US imperialist aggression, we must contribute all our strength to step up production, fully supply the military and civilian food flour, and strengthen our combat strength. Wang Litang, manager of Zhongnong Flour Mill, said: Some of us hate Japanese imperialism with gnashing teeth, but our hatred for US imperialism is not deep enough. In fact, uncovering the US imperialists' hypocritical mask, the US imperialists' various "bloodless" acts of aggression are worse than those of Japanese imperialism. At the industry's general meeting, a "Statement on Resisting America, Aiding Korea, Protecting the Home, and Defending the Nation" was unanimously adopted. In addition to expressing support for the joint declaration of the various democratic parties and the five patriotic pledges of the Beijing industrial and commercial circles, it also proposed: "We vow to strengthen labor-capital unity, strengthen the coordination between public and private relations, step up production, strive for economy, ensure the supply of flour in the city, assist the government in stabilizing social order, and fight for the sacred task of consolidating the economic front to resist America and aid Korea." The cinema industry and the foreign wine and soda industry also issued statements. The statement of the cinema industry, after recounting the past oppression and exploitation suffered by the industry from the US imperialist MGM, Warner and other eight film companies, and the harm to the Chinese people caused by the US imperialist films that promoted pornography, theft, assassination and narcotics, resolutely stated that it would use the weapon of film propaganda to raise the people's ideological awareness, and inspire the people's fighting will and the conviction of victory in resisting America, aiding Korea, protecting their homes, and defending the nation.

　　京工商业界各行公会
　  展开抗美援朝保家卫国运动            
　　讨论如何实践五项“爱国公约”
    【本报讯】京市工商业界正积极展开抗美援朝保家卫国运动。各行业公会于工商界发表宣言后，正召开会员大会或座谈会，讨论时事并研究怎样以实践五项“爱国公约”、巩固经济战线的实际行动抗美援朝。截至十一日止，已有机制面粉业、电影院业、贸易业、自行车业、酱油业、油盐醋业、石粉业、洋酒汽水业等分别集会。会上一致认为各行业在解放以后，特别是在今春政府统一财经工作、物价稳定之后，正逐渐走向好转与发展的时候，美帝扩大侵略战争，是企图再重新回来统治中国人民，垄断中国市场，摧残中国民族工商业。工商业者要坚决反抗，要和全国人民团结一道保家卫国，粉碎美帝侵略野心。在机制面粉业的大会上，唯一面粉厂副经理说：美帝为倾销过剩的面粉商品，在解放以前以救济为名，大量把“利朗”、“红光”粉涌进我们的市场。结果，我们的工厂倒闭，工人失业，无法维持生产。解放后一年零十个月来，北京市面粉业得到极大发展，工厂厂数、职工人数、机磨台数、面粉月产量已超过解放前一倍到两倍。为了保卫我们的和平经济建设，反抗美帝的侵略，就必须贡献一切力量来加紧生产，充分供应军需民食的面粉，增强战斗力量。中农面粉厂经理王立堂说：我们有些人一提日本帝国主义就咬牙切齿的痛恨，对美帝就仇恨不深。其实，揭开美帝人面兽心假面具，美帝种种“杀人不见血”的侵略行为比日帝有过之无不及。该业大会上，一致通过了“抗美援朝保家卫国声明”除去表示拥护各民主党派的联合宣言及北京市工商界的五项爱国公约之外，并提出：“誓以加强劳资团结，加强公私关系的调协配合，加紧生产，力求节约，保证本市面粉供应，协助政府安定社会秩序，为巩固经济战线抗美援朝的神圣任务而奋斗。电影院业、洋酒汽水业等也发表了声明。电影院业的声明在历诉该业过去遭受美帝米高梅、华纳等八家影片公司的压迫剥削和美帝以色情偷盗暗杀麻醉的影片毒害中国人民之后，坚决表示要以电影宣传的武器来提高人民的思想觉悟，鼓舞人民抗美援朝保家卫国的战斗意志和必胜的信念。
