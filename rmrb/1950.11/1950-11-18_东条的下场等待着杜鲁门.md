　　Tojo's Fate Awaits Truman
　　The purpose of American imperialism's aggression against Korea is to invade our country, which is now very clear. Looking at the world map, we can see that on the eastern and southern borders of our country, there are countless military bases of American imperialism, such as Japan, Korea, Ryukyu, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, etc., like countless sharp knives pointing at our country. Among them, Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam are the closest to our mainland and have particularly important strategic positions. American imperialism attempts to rely on these bases to launch a large-scale offensive against our country. This offensive has already begun gradually. According to a report from the Telecommunications Agency: the strategic plan approved by Truman for the United States to adopt "military action in China" reveals: "The U.S. High Command recommends using Korean territory and Korean troops to conduct operations in Manchuria and some northern areas as part of the strategic plan. The territories and military bases of Indochina, Burma, and Hong Kong will be used as bases for the southern front to attack South China. Strong paratrooper units will be transported from Taiwan to areas around Shanghai and other areas in Central and South China." From this strategic plan, we can understand why American imperialism wants to attack Korea, why it wants to seize our country's Taiwan while attacking Korea, and why it is desperately supporting French imperialism in attacking the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
　　Why is American imperialism so enthusiastic about invading our country? According to British Conservative MP Gammans: "If Asia is conquered by communism, I don't see how Europe and the United States can survive." An Associated Press reporter also said: "This huge reservoir of armed forces (referring to our country) cooperating with Red Russia will continue to be a terrible threat to democratic countries (i.e., imperialism) as long as it exists. Communist China is the heart of the Asian Bolshevik movement." These words, although distorted and absurd, reveal the true situation in Asia today from the opposite perspective. If translated, it means: "If the liberation movements of all oppressed nations in Asia are completely successful, American imperialism and other European imperialist countries will not be able to survive because they cannot invade." "China and the Soviet Union cooperate, and their strength is invincible. China and the Soviet Union will never allow imperialism to carry out aggression unscrupulously. The success of the Chinese revolution is a powerful encouragement to the people of all colonial countries in Asia. China has become the center of the Asian national liberation movement." Obviously, according to the logic of American imperialism, it must invade our country to annex Asia.
　　For a hundred years, American imperialism has been plotting to invade our country. Before World War I, American imperialism's power was not enough to dominate China alone. Therefore, it proposed and insisted on the aggressive policies of "open door" and "equal opportunity," which, in simple terms, meant: everyone gets a share in invading China. After World War I, Tsarist Russia was overthrown, and the socialist Soviet Union appeared. Germany was completely defeated, and the strength of Britain and France was weakened compared to before the war. Japan's power expanded greatly compared to before the war, becoming the strongest opponent of American imperialism in its struggle for the Far East. In the twenty years from World War I to World War II, the United States and Japan sometimes colluded and sometimes clashed in order to invade China, the purpose of which was to strive for exclusive control over China. After World War II, Japan surrendered unconditionally (and actually became a colony of American imperialism). Britain and France were reduced to second-rate countries, and the past opponents were either dead or injured. American imperialism thought that it could肆无忌惮ly dominate Asia from now on. However, the forces of the Chinese people's revolution had been developing long before World War I. By the time of the Anti-Japanese War, the People's Liberation Army led by the Chinese Communist Party had become the main force in the resistance against Japan. In the eyes of American imperialists, this was the main obstacle to its獨霸of Asia. Therefore, after the end of the Anti-Japanese War, American imperialism immediately directed its running dog Chiang Kai-shek to launch an unprecedented large-scale offensive against the Chinese people. American imperialism invested huge capital of six billion U.S. dollars in this sinful gamble. However, the course of events was completely beyond the expectations of the American imperialists: Chiang Kai-shek was overthrown, the People's Republic of China was established, and American invaders were completely driven out of the Chinese mainland. From then on, a completely new situation emerged in Asia. A new China with a population of 475 million, as the center of Asian political life, its victorious influence powerfully encouraged the liberation struggles of the Eastern colonial peoples. The United States' goal is to独霸 the world, and its spearheads are Europe and Asia. According to the thinking of American imperialism, and based on the reality of the world situation, the United States must invade our country to独霸 Asia.
　　American imperialism's plan to invade our country was completely learned from Japanese imperialism. The Japanese imperialists' plan of aggression is fully expressed in the Tanaka Memorial. Tanaka wrote: "Stealing the late Emperor Meiji's遗策, the first phase is to conquer Taiwan, the second phase is to conquer Korea, and the third phase is to destroy Manchuria and Mongolia, and to conquer the entire territory of China." It also said: "To conquer China, one must first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia; to conquer the world, one must first conquer China." The Tanaka Memorial was written in 1927. At that time, China's vigorous revolution was developing victoriously, and the Soviet Union had given our people fair and selfless assistance in the revolution. Therefore, the Tanaka Memorial also said: "...From now on, it is necessary to build the South Manchurian Great Circular (railway) line with military purposes, which can surround the center of Manchuria and Mongolia, to制支那the military, political, economic, and other developments, and also prevent the invasion of Russian forces. This is the most necessary key to the creation of our country's new continent." Japanese imperialism believed that occupying Manchuria and Mongolia could both conquer China and prevent the Soviet Union from assisting the Chinese revolution and further attacking the Soviet Union. In their view, this two-pronged approach was the "most necessary key" in the entire policy of aggression.
　　Japanese imperialism's aggression against China was completely carried out according to the steps mentioned in the Tanaka Memorial. Japanese imperialists initially invaded Korea in 1592, defeating the Chinese Ming Dynasty army that went to aid Korea. Subsequently, Saigo Takamori, Ito Hirobumi, and others, representatives of the Japanese northern advance aggression policy, vigorously advocated "征韩论," attempting to annex Korea. In 1874, Japan initially invaded Taiwan, forcibly occupying the Ryukyu Islands. In 1894, due to Japan's invasion of Korea, China and Japan engaged in the "Sino-Japanese War." After a disastrous defeat, the Qing government was forced to sign the Treaty of Shimonoseki with Japan. According to this treaty, Japan annexed Taiwan and controlled Korea. After the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Japan seized Lushun, Dalian, and all the privileges that Tsarist Russia originally had in southern Manchuria, according to the Treaty of Portsmouth. Japan's aggressive forces entered Northeast China without any hindrance. In 1910, Japan officially annexed Korea, obtaining a base for further aggression against Northeast China and Shandong and other places. In the "September 18th Incident" in 1931, Japan used Korea as a base to annex the entire Northeast of our country. In the "July 7th Incident" in 1937, Japan again used the Northeast as a base to launch a full-scale offensive against our country. Within the ruling group of Japanese imperialism, there was a so-called dispute between "mainland policy" and "maritime policy" or "southern advance" and "northern advance." The former advocated using Korea as a base to attack Northeast China and North China, and then to occupy the entire China. The latter advocated relying on Taiwan to invade the southeastern coastal provinces of our country, and further invade Southeast Asia. As a result of the debate, the former proposition gradually gained the upper hand. The Tanaka Memorial is a representative work of the "mainland policy" or "northern advance policy." However, Japan did not abandon its conspiracy to advance southward in the process of advancing northward. It actively managed Taiwan and regarded the Fujian area as its sphere of influence. When Japan launched the Pacific War in 1942, it used Taiwan as the most important forward base.
　　American imperialism is following the old path of Japanese aggression against our country, which is a fact known to the world. The difference is that American imperialism now has no powerful enemy in the ocean, while Japan might have clashed with Britain, the United States, France, and other countries if it had advanced southward at that time. Therefore, American imperialism is now adopting a method of advancing both north and south in Asia, supporting French imperialism in attacking the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, supporting British imperialism in attacking the people's armed forces in Malaya, and supporting its Philippine running dogs in attacking the people's armed forces in the Philippines. The purpose is nothing more than to clear the revolutionary forces in these areas and consolidate the rear of these military bases for attacking our country. On the other hand, and more importantly, it is attacking the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and practically occupying our country's Taiwan, using it as a forward base for attacking our mainland. Stationed in Japan, wielding the two knives of Korea and Taiwan, and inserting them into the heart of our country, this is American imperialism's strategic goal in the East.
　　In order to realize this sinister conspiracy, American imperialism, in addition to actively preparing for war in its own country, has also widely organized various reactionary forces. In South Korea, American imperialism equipped and trained 100,000 puppet troops and controlled the system's command of these puppet troops, using them as a vanguard for invading Korea. In Japan, American imperialism actively supported its militaristic aggressive forces. The Japanese army has been rebuilt under the guise of police, with a total of 300,000 troops. A plan to expand to 700,000 is underway. As of July of this year, Japan's naval armed personnel had reached 10,000, with more than 300 ships of various types. The United States also plans to mobilize 50,000 former Japanese naval officers, who will be trained by American experts to form a new Japanese armed force. The Japanese air force is actively being rebuilt under the guise of "civil aviation." The American occupation authorities are recruiting a large number of Japanese pilots and actively training them in both Japan and the United States. The original more than 200 Japanese airports have been greatly expanded, and 33 large airports have been newly built in Yokohama and other places. Japan has become the United States' "Asian arsenal," with 300 aircraft manufacturing plants and 178 arsenals rushing to manufacture large quantities of killing weapons. After the American aggression against Korea broke out, ships of Japan's "Maritime Safety Agency" openly invaded Korean waters to carry out patrol missions. According to the New Era magazine, Japanese air force personnel have jointly attacked Korea with American air force personnel. In the two months after the outbreak of the Korean War, Japan's war industry alone accepted $40 million in orders from the United States. In Taiwan, American imperialism established a large military base and actively supported and equipped Chiang Kai-shek's remaining bandit gang. From January to May of this year, the American tanks transported to Taiwan, according to the public figures disclosed by various news agencies, amounted to more than 700. Hundreds of aircraft have been handed over to the Chiang bandits. After the US Seventh Fleet invaded Taiwan, it immediately launched extensive "patrol" activities. According to a reporter from the New York Herald Tribune, its patrol range extended from the waters off Shantou, Guangdong in the south to the waters off Qingdao, Shandong in the north, a north-south distance of 3,000 miles. The 13th Air Force of American imperialism has established a forward command post in Taiwan. According to a report by the Chiang bandits' Central News Agency, the task of this agency is to "handle the liaison between the Central (Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang) and American air forces and related joint combat matters." What are all these preparations for? In a letter from Yoon Byung-koo, advisor to the puppet government of Lee Seung-man, to Lee Seung-man, everything has been said. Yoon Byung-koo wrote: "We must coordinate our actions in three aspects under the leadership of the supreme commander. These three aspects are: the Japanese must advance through Vladivostok along the northeastern protruding area; the Korean and American troops, after liberating our northern territory, must advance through the Liaodong Peninsula to Harbin; and the Chinese Kuomintang must recover the lost territories of China (including Liaodong Province). After the war, the Korean and American troops must occupy Manchuria."
　　Can American imperialism achieve this arrogant plan? History has already answered this question. The fate of Japanese imperialism's aggression against our country was "unconditional surrender." When Japan surrendered, the People's Republic of China had not yet been established, and the strength of the Chinese people was far less than it is now. In the four years of the Liberation War, our people annihilated more than 8 million Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops fully supported by American imperialism. This number is more than five times the existing armed forces of American imperialism. Facing the new China with a population of 475 million after the victory of the revolution, facing the strength of the world peace and democracy camp that far exceeds the strength of imperialism, what kind of fate will American imperialism get is very clear. The lesson of the past is not far away, please Washington look at Tokyo, Tojo's fate awaits Truman and MacArthur.

　　东条的下场等待着杜鲁门
    美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的目的是侵略我国，现在已经看得非常明显了。翻开世界地图，我们可以看到，在我国东部和南部边疆，有无数美帝国主义的军事基地，如日本，朝鲜，琉球，台湾，菲律宾，越南等等，像无数把尖刀，指向我国。其中和我国大陆距离最近而其战略地位又特别重要的，当推朝鲜、台湾和越南。美帝国主义企图依托这些基地，向我国大举进攻。这种进攻，现在已经逐步开始了。据电通社讯：曾经杜鲁门批准的美国“一旦要在中国采取军事行动”时采用的战略计划中透露：“美国高级指挥部建议利用朝鲜领土和朝鲜军队在满洲和北方某些地区进行作战，作为战略计划的一部分。印度支那、缅甸和香港的领土以及军事基地，将被用作进攻华南的南方战线的基地。强大的伞兵部队将由台湾运往上海周围地区及华中华南的其他地区。”从这个战略计划中，我们就可以了解美帝国主义为什么要进攻朝鲜，为什么要在进攻朝鲜的同时，侵占我国的台湾，以及为什么要拚命支援法帝国主义，进攻越南人民共和国了。
    美帝国主义为什么这样热中于侵略我国呢？据英国保守党议员加门斯说：“假如亚洲被共产主义所征服的话，我看不到欧洲和美国还能活下去。”美联社记者也说：“这个巨大的武装力量的蓄水池（按指我国）与赤色的俄国合作，只要它存在一天，将继续是对于民主国家（按即帝国主义）的一个可怕的威胁。共产党中国是亚洲布尔什维主义运动的心脏。”这些话虽是颠倒黑白的胡说，但却从反面道出了今天亚洲的真实情况。如果把它翻译过来，就是：“假若亚洲各被压迫民族的解放运动完全成功，美帝国主义和欧洲其他帝国主义国家，都将由于不能侵略而活不下去。”“中国和苏联合作，其力量是不可战胜的。中国和苏联，决不允许帝国主义肆行侵略。中国革命成功了，这对于亚洲各殖民地国家的人民，是一个最有力的鼓舞，中国已成为亚洲民族解放运动的中心。”显然，按照美帝国主义的逻辑，它要吞并亚洲，必须侵略我国。
    一百年来，美帝国主义即处心积虑侵略我国。在第一次世界大战以前，美帝国主义的力量还不足独霸中国。所以它提出了并坚持着“门户开放”、“机会均等”的侵略政策，用一句通俗的话说，就是：侵略中国大家有份。第一次世界大战结束后，帝俄被打倒了，出现了社会主义的苏联，德国完全失败，英法的力量较战前削弱，日本的势力则较战前大为膨胀，成为美帝国主义争夺远东的最强的对手。从第一次世界大战到第二次世界大战的二十年中，美日为了侵略中国，时而勾结，时而冲突，目的都是争取对中国的独占。第二次世界大战结束后，日本无条件投降（并且实际上变成了美帝国主义的殖民地），英法降为二等国，过去的对手或死或伤，美帝国主义以为从此可以肆无忌惮地独霸亚洲了。但是，远在第一次世界大战以后，中国人民革命的力量就有了发展。到了抗日战争时期，中国共产党所领导的人民解放军，已成为抗日的主要力量，在美帝国主义者的眼中，这是它独霸亚洲的主要障碍。因此，抗日战争结束后，美帝国主义立即指挥其走狗蒋介石，向中国人民发动了史无前例的大进攻。美帝国主义在这次罪恶的赌博中，曾经投入六十亿美金的巨大资本。但是，事变的进程，完全出乎美帝国主义者的预料之外：蒋介石被打倒了，中华人民共和国建立了，美国侵略者完全被赶出中国大陆，从此，亚洲出现了一个全新的局面。一个拥有四万七千五百万人口的新中国，作为亚洲政治生活的重心，其胜利影响，有力地鼓舞了东方殖民地人民的解放斗争。美国的目的是独霸世界，其矛头一是欧洲，一是亚洲，按照美帝国主义的想法，证诸世界形势的现实，美国欲独霸亚洲，势非侵占我国不可。
    美帝国主义侵略我国的计划，完全是从日本帝国主义学来的。日本帝国主义的侵略计划，完整地表现在田中奏折中。田中写道：“窃明治大帝之遗策，第一期征服台湾，第二期征服朝鲜，第三期灭亡满蒙，以及征服中国全土。”又说：“欲征服中国必先征服满蒙，欲征服世界必先征服中国。”田中奏折是一九二七年写的，当时中国轰轰烈烈的大革命正在胜利发展，苏联曾在大革命中，给予我国人民公正无私的援助。所以，田中奏折中又说：“……此后必须以军事为目的建设南满大循环（铁路）线，而可包围满蒙中心地，以制支那之军事政治经济等等发达，亦可防杜俄势之侵入，此乃我国之新大陆造成上最大必要的关键也。”日本帝国主义认为占领了满蒙，既可以征服中国，又可以防止苏联援助中国革命并进而进攻苏联。在它们看来，这种一箭双雕的办法，实为整个侵略政策中“最大必要的关键”。
    日本帝国主义对于中国的侵略，完全是依照田中奏折中所举的步骤进行的。日本帝国主义者于一五九二年初犯朝鲜，打败了往援朝鲜的中国明朝的军队。其后，日本北进主义侵略政策的代表西乡隆盛、伊藤博文之流，即大肆鼓吹“征韩论”，企图吞并朝鲜。一八七四年，日本初犯台湾，强占了琉球群岛。一八九四年，由于日本侵略朝鲜，中国与日本发生了“甲午之战”，满清政府于惨败之后，被迫和日本订立了马关条约。日本根据这一条约，吞并了台湾，控制了朝鲜。一九○五年日俄战争后，日本根据朴资茅斯条约，夺取了旅顺、大连和沙皇俄国原在南满的种种特权，日本的侵略势力，毫无阻拦地进入我国的东北。一九一○年，日本正式并吞朝鲜，获得了进一步侵略我国东北和山东等地的基地。一九三一年“九一八”事变，日本以朝鲜为基地，并吞了我国整个东北。一九三七年“七七”事变，日本又以东北为基地，发动了对于我国的全面进攻。在日本帝国主义统治集团内部，曾有所谓“大陆政策”与“海洋政策”或“南进”与“北进”之争，前者主张以朝鲜为基地，进攻东北、华北，进而攻占全中国，后者主张依托台湾，侵略我国东南沿海各省，进一步侵略南洋。争论结果，前一种主张逐渐占了上风，田中奏折就是“大陆政策”或“北进政策”的代表作。但是，日本在北进的过程中，并未放弃南进的阴谋，它积极经营台湾，并把福建一带据为自己的势力范围。一九四二年日本发动太平洋战争时，即以台湾作为最重要的前进基地。
    美帝国主义走着日本侵略我国的老路，已是举世周知的事实。所不同者，是美帝国主义现在在海洋方面，并无有力的敌手，而当时日本如果南进，却可能与英美法等国发生冲突。因此，美帝国主义现在对亚洲采取了南北并进的方法，一方面支持法帝国主义进攻越南人民共和国，支持英帝国主义进攻马来亚的人民武装，支持其菲律宾的走狗进攻菲岛的人民武装，其目的无非是扫清这些地区的革命力量，巩固这些进攻我国的军事基地的后方。而在另一方面，也是主要的一方面，则是进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，并实际上占领了我国的台湾，以之作为进攻我国大陆的前进基地。立在日本，手执朝鲜、台湾两把刀，插入我国的心脏，这就是美帝国主义在东方的战略目标。
    为了实现这一罪恶的阴谋，美帝国主义除了在其本国积极备战外，同时还广泛地组织了各种反动力量。在南朝鲜，美帝国主义装备与训练了十万傀儡军，并掌握了这支傀儡军的系统的指挥权，以之作为侵略朝鲜的先锋队。在日本，美帝国主义积极扶植其军国主义侵略力量。日本的陆军已在警察名义伪装下重建起来，总数已达三十万人，一个扩充七十万人的计划正在进行中。截至本年七月，日本的海军武装人员已达一万名，各种舰船达三百余艘，美国还计划动员前日本海军军官五万名，由美国专家加以训练，组成一支新的日本武装部队。日本的空军正在“民用航空”的伪装下积极重建，美国占领当局大量招募日本飞行员，在日本及美国两地积极训练。日本原有的二百多个飞机场均已大加扩充，横滨等地且已新建了三十三个大飞机场。日本已成为美国的“亚洲兵工厂”，三百家飞机制造厂，一百七十八家兵工厂，正赶造大批杀人武器。美国侵略朝鲜战争发生后，日本“海上保安厅”的舰艇已公开侵入朝鲜海面，担任巡逻任务，据新时代杂志揭露，日本空军人员已与美国空军人员，共同进攻朝鲜。在朝鲜战争爆发后的两个月中，仅日本战争工业即接受了美国四千万美元的订货。在台湾，美帝国主义建立了庞大的军事基地，并积极扶植与装备蒋介石残余匪帮。从今年一月至五月，美国运到台湾的坦克，仅各通讯社披露的公开数字，即达七百多辆。几百架飞机已经交给蒋匪。美帝国主义的第七舰队侵入台湾后，立即展开广泛的“巡逻”活动，据纽约先驱论坛报记者报道，其巡逻范围南起广东汕头海面，北迄山东青岛海面，南北长达三千里。美帝国主义的第十三航空队已经成立了驻台前进指挥所，据蒋匪中央社报道，这个机构的任务是“就近处理中（蒋家匪帮）美空军之联络及有关联合作战事宜。”这种种准备工作是为了什么，在李承晚傀儡政府外务部顾问尹炳求致李承晚的信中，已经和盘说了出来。尹炳求写道：“必须在最高统帅的领导下，从三方面配合行动。这三方面就是：日本人必须沿着东北部突出地带穿过海参威前进；朝鲜和美国的军队在解放了我们的北部领土后，必须穿过辽东半岛进抵哈尔滨；中国国民党必须光复中国失去的领土（其中包括辽东省）。在战争结束后，朝鲜和美国军队必须占领满洲。”
    美帝国主义这种狂妄的计划，能否达到目的呢？历史已经回答了这个问题。日本帝国主义侵略我国的下场，是“无条件投降”。在日本投降的时候，中华人民共和国还未成立，中国人民的力量，远没有现在这样强大。我国人民在四年的解放战争中，歼灭了由美帝国主义全力支持的蒋家匪军八百多万人，这个数字，等于美帝国主义现有武装力量的五倍多。面对着革命胜利了的四亿七千五百万人口的新中国，面对着远远超过帝国主义力量的世界和平民主阵营的力量，美帝国主义将会得到一个什么下场，是很明白的。殷鉴非遥，请华盛顿看东京，东条的命运等待着杜鲁门、麦克阿瑟们。
