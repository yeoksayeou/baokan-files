Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 8th: According to a dispatch from the Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, on the 6th: The Japan Peace Supporters Committee announced at the Japan Peace Supporters Congress on the 5th that 5,870,000 signatures had been collected throughout Japan for the Stockholm Appeal. Son Kai-gaku (transliteration), a Korean residing in Oyama, near Tokyo, collected 15,018 signatures on his own, setting a new record for the number of signatures collected by an individual.

Seventy representatives of peace fighters from all over Japan attended the congress. The congress discussed ways to strengthen the peace movement under the current difficult conditions and decided to establish 10,000 local peace support committees to organize 10 million people. Currently, there are 600 local peace support committees in Japan.

The congress pointed out the importance of the five peace slogans put forward by the Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress in Prague in August; and called on local peace forums to add "Opposition to Japanese Rearmament" and "Overall Peace Treaty with Japan" to the list of discussion topics.

The congress declared that forty delegates had been selected to attend the upcoming Second World Peace Congress, but noted that everyone believes it is almost impossible for the delegates to obtain passports from MacArthur Headquarters.

According to a United Press dispatch: In order to further promote the peace movement widely, the Standing Committee of the Japan Peace Supporters Committee decided on a peace proposal on October 13, calling on all peace-loving people in Japan to hold peace forums to discuss issues such as the prohibition of atomic weapons, opposition to Japanese rearmament, an overall peace treaty with Japan, and world peace.

    【新华社八日讯】据电通社东京六日讯：日本拥护和平委员会五日在日本拥护和平大会中宣布：日本各地已为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集了五百八十七万个签名。居住在东京附近小山地方的朝鲜人孙凯学（译音），一个人征集了一万五千零十八个签名，创造了个人征集签名数字的新纪录。

    大会指出八月间世界保卫和平大会常设委员会执行局布拉格会议所提出的五个和平口号的重要性；并号召各地和平座谈会在讨论题目单上增添“反对日本重新武装”和“全面对日和约”两项。
    大会宣称：已选出四十个代表出席即将到来的第二届世界保卫和平大会，但是大会指出：大家认为代表们几乎不可能从麦克阿瑟总部领到出国护照。
    另据联合通讯社消息：为了进一步广泛地推动和平运动，日本拥护和平委员会常任委员会在十月十三日决定了一个和平提案，号召全日爱好和平的人民举行和平座谈会，讨论关于禁止原子武器、反对日本重新武装、全面对日和约、世界和平诸问题。
