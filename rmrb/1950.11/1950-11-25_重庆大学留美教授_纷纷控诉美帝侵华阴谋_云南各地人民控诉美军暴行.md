Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd: Professors at National Chongqing University who had studied in the United States have, during the school's current affairs study discussion meetings, revealed the US imperialists' hostility towards China and their conspiracy to invade China.

Professor Li Tangmi, who studied at Yale University in the United States from 1935 to 1940, said at the symposium: "During our War of Resistance Against Japan, the US imperialists paid lip service to 'upholding justice.' But in 1940, the ship I took back to China was fully loaded with gasoline and scrap iron being transported to Japan." Professor Luo Zhetan, who served as a translator for the US military in China in 1943, used facts he had witnessed to accuse the US military of cooperating with the US intelligence agency to collect intelligence and map China. Professor Luo Zhetan also accused the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang of mistreating translators. He said that He Zhongyi, a student at the School of Business of Chongqing University who worked as a translator with him, could not stand the treatment of being a "translator slave" by the US military and requested a transfer. As a result, he was unreasonably arrested and imprisoned by the Kunming office of the Foreign Affairs Bureau of the Kuomintang Military Commission. Later, He Zhongyi died in prison. Luo Zhetan said that he had witnessed US soldiers raping Chinese women in Kunming on many occasions. Professor Luo Zhetan, when studying at the Colorado School of Mines and the Colorado State University in the United States in 1948, saw a group of so-called "missionaries" preparing to come to China. In the maps they carried, they divided the ethnic minority areas of Yunnan into small circles. These "missionaries" even presumptuously called the ethnic minority areas of Yunnan "independent countries." They used the name of "preaching" but were actually doing espionage work, undermining the unity of all ethnic groups in China; they were serving the imperialist goals of invading China. Other professors at Chongqing University who had studied in the United States also successively accused US imperialists of insulting overseas Chinese and students studying abroad.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 20th: People from all walks of life in Yunnan have successively accused the US military of beastly atrocities in various parts of Yunnan. The Yunnan Daily on the 19th of this month devoted almost a full page to publishing these accusations from people of all walks of life.

The accusation letter from Liu Fuchang, a typesetter at the Yunnan Daily, wrote: After Japan surrendered in August 1945, the US military stationed in Kunming decided to "transfer" its remaining materials to the Kuomintang reactionary government before leaving. However, these materials had long been stolen and sold by a few bandits in the US military logistics headquarters. When it came time to "transfer," the accounts could not be settled, and the US military falsely accused the twelve Chinese administrators and two guards in charge of the warehouse of stealing the materials; then the American beasts dragged these fourteen innocent compatriots to the suburbs in the middle of the night and killed them.

Another blood case of the US military's collective massacre of our compatriots occurred in Zhanyi County in northeastern Yunnan. Zhang Wei, who once served as the pseudo-county magistrate of the county, wrote: There was a US military supply depot's auto repair shop in the north gate of Zhanyi city, which employed more than one hundred Chinese workers. Under the arrogant oppression and exploitation of the US military, a dozen Chinese workers suggested to the US military to increase wages and stop beating people indiscriminately, which immediately aroused the anger of the US military. The American cannibals loaded these auto repair workers onto trucks in the middle of the night in June 1945 and drove them to Baisha River Shiban Well outside the north gate of the county and killed them all. The bandits secretly buried the bodies. Zhang Wei said: "The Kuomintang reactionary government at the time kept this crime a secret and tried its best to cover up for their 'allies.' As a result, this blood case was never resolved."

In addition, the Yunnan Daily has also received many letters accusing the US military of causing trouble while drunk and raping women. They all unanimously stated that the Chinese people will never forget this blood feud, and blood debts must be paid in blood!

　　重庆大学留美教授
    纷纷控诉美帝侵华阴谋
    云南各地人民控诉美军暴行
    【新华社重庆二十三日电】国立重庆大学曾经留学美国的教授在该校时事学习讨论会中纷纷揭露美帝国主义敌视中国和侵略中国的阴谋。
    一九三五年到一九四零年在美国耶鲁大学读书的李唐泌教授在座谈会上说：“我国抗日战争时期，美帝国主义口口声声说‘主持正义’。但一九四零年我回国所乘的轮船上，就满载着大批汽油和废铁输往日本。”一九四三年曾为驻华美军担任翻译的罗蛰谭教授，以他亲眼看到的事实，指控美军配合美国谍报局在我国搜集情报，测绘我国地图。罗蛰谭教授并指控美国和蒋匪帮对翻译人员的虐待。他说，和他一道作翻译员的重庆大学商学院学生何中毅因不堪忍受美军“译奴”的待遇，要求调职，结果被国民党军事委员会外事局昆明办事处无理拘捕入狱。后来何中毅竟瘐死狱中。罗蛰谭说，他在昆明曾多次目击美军强奸我国妇女的罪行。罗蛰谭教授于一九四八年在美国柯罗拉多矿冶大学和克罗马州立大学读书时，曾看见一批准备来中国的所谓“传教士”，在他们所带的地图中，把云南少数民族区域划成一个一个的小圆圈。这些“传教士”竟妄称我云南少数民族地区为“独立国”。他们假借“传教”的名义，实际上是来做间谍工作，挑拨中国各民族团结；他们是为侵略中国的帝国主义目的服务的。重庆大学其他曾留学美国的教授也相继控诉美帝国主义凌辱华侨和留学生的暴行。
    【新华社昆明二十日电】云南各地各界人民，纷纷控诉美军在云南各地的兽性暴行。本月十九日的云南日报几乎是以全版地位刊登各界人民的该项控诉。
    云南日报铸字房工人柳福昌的控诉书写道：一九四五年八月日本投降后，驻在昆明的美军，决定在离开前将其剩余物资“移交”给国民党反动政府。但此项物资早被美军后勤司令部的几个匪徒盗卖光了，“移交”时交不出账，美军硬诬赖说是管仓库的十二个中国管理员和二名警卫把物资偷光了；接着美国野兽就在半夜将这十四位无辜的同胞拉到郊外杀害了。
    另一件美军集体屠杀我国同胞的血案是在云南东北部沾益县发生的。曾任该县伪县长的张伟写道：在沾益城北门有一个美军供应处的汽车修理厂，其中招雇了一百多个我国工人。在美军蛮横的压迫和剥削下，曾有十几个中国工人向美军建议提高工资和不要乱打人，当即惹起了美军恼怒，美国吃人生番就在一九四五年六月间的一个深夜，用卡车载上这些汽车修理工人，驶至该县北门外白沙河石板井悉数杀害，匪徒们并将尸体秘密掩埋。张伟说：“当时的国民党反动政府对这件罪行一直保守秘密，尽量为他们的‘盟友’掩饰，结果这件血案毫无下文。”
    此外，云南日报还收到许多控诉美军酗酒闯祸、强奸妇女的来信，他们均一致表示中国人民是不会忘记这种血海深仇的，血债必须用血来偿还！
