　　Beijing Telecommunications Bureau
　　Reduced Telecommunications Prices Yesterday
　　Opened Letter Telegram and Night Long-Distance Telephone Services
　　In order to adapt to the current social and economic situation of the country, the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau has reduced telecommunications prices starting from the 11th of this month. After this adjustment, the telecommunications fee per unit is changed to RMB 1,500 yuan. The domestic ordinary telegram fee is 900 yuan per word within the province (originally 1,280 yuan), and 1,350 yuan per word outside the province (originally 1,920 yuan). The translation fee is 100 yuan per word (originally 160 yuan). The overall average telegram price has been reduced by 25 percent. The monthly rental fee for city telephones will eliminate Category C users and include them in Category B billing. The base numbers for Category A and B remain unchanged. The price of public telephones has been reduced by 28 percent, with retail prices within the city at 400 yuan per call (originally 550 yuan). The incidental fees for city telephones have been reduced by 20 percent to a maximum of 90 percent. Separate installment payment and preferential measures are stipulated for installation, relocation, and deposit fees. In addition, express telegrams and express telephone services, which are unsuitable for current social needs and have higher prices, have been cancelled. Two new discounted services, half-price letter telegrams and night long-distance telephone calls, have been opened. These indicate that the operation and service of people's telecommunications will become more widespread due to the reduction in prices.
