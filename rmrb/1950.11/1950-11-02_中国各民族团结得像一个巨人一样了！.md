　　The Chinese Nationalities are United Like a Giant!
　　Yunnan Nationalities, Li Qinghai
　　For thousands of years, we have been discriminated against and oppressed as minority nationalities. The reactionary rulers of past dynasties drove us into the deep mountains and remote jungles, where we suffered from poverty, disease, and death. Finally, today, Chairman Mao and the Communist Party have rescued us from our suffering.
　　As soon as we arrived in Beijing, we felt the warmth of the motherland. When we saw Chairman Mao, it was like orphans seeing their parents again, and we were so happy that we couldn't speak. We were welcomed and entertained everywhere. During the National Day parade, at the banquet hosted by Chairman Mao, in the Shijingshan factory, at the gala evenings, at the Beijing People's Sports Meeting... we received great comfort and felt excited. For the first time, we experienced the loveliness of the motherland and realized that we were living in the era of equality and happiness under Mao Zedong.
　　But today, the vicious and evil American imperialist bandits want to bully us again, trying to destroy our peaceful and happy life since liberation and seize our fruits of victory. We warn them: The Chinese nationalities have united like a giant! This is an unprecedentedly powerful force in our country's history, sufficient to crush any aggression. We have said many times: The Chinese people love peace. But those who love peace must defend peace and must crush the aggression that destroys peace. If American imperialism does not pull back from the brink and immediately withdraw its invading troops from Korea, and cease threatening our country's security, it will surely suffer a bloody nose!

　　中国各民族团结得像一个巨人一样了！
    云南民家族李晴海
    我们是数千年来被歧视被压迫的少数民族。历代反动的统治者将我们赶到深山野箐，受尽了穷、病和死亡的折磨。好容易挨到了今天，毛主席、共产党把我们从苦难中拯救出来。
    一到北京，我们就感到祖国的温暖。我们看见了毛主席，就像孤儿重见了自己的父母，喜欢得说不出话来。我们到处受欢迎，到处受招待。在国庆节大游行中，在毛主席招待的宴会上，在石景山工厂里，在联欢晚会上，在北京市人民体育会上……我们都得到极大的安慰，感到了兴奋。我们第一次体验到祖国的可爱，体验到我们是生活在平等幸福的毛泽东的时代里了。
    可是今天，穷凶极恶的美帝国主义强盗们竟要再来欺侮我们，妄图破坏我们解放以来和平幸福的生活，夺取我们的胜利果实。我们警告他们：中国各民族已经团结得像一个巨人一样了！这是我国历史上空前未有的强大力量，足以粉碎任何侵略。我们说过许多遍了：中国人民热爱和平。但热爱和平者必须保卫和平，必须粉碎破坏和平的侵略。美帝国主义如不悬崖勒马，立刻撤退侵朝军队，停止威胁我国的安全，它一定要碰得头破血流！
