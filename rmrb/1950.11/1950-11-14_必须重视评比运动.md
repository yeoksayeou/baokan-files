　　We Must Attach Importance to the Evaluation and Comparison Movement
　　Wang Guanqiong
    Between August and September of this year, rural areas in some parts of North China launched a widespread agricultural production evaluation and comparison movement, combining production inspections with the "Three Autumns" campaign. Because this movement was carried out after the completion of land reform, the feudal system of exploitation was destroyed, and the economic life of farmers had gradually improved, it had an extremely broad mass base. Farmers combined their own practical experience for evaluation and comparison, which played a significant role in improving production technology.
    The evaluation and comparison movement is a mass movement. Through this movement, a mass summary of each stage of agricultural production can be achieved. In terms of leading agricultural production methods, this is also a concrete form of following the mass line. In the process of evaluation and comparison, by comparing the quality of crops and finding the reasons for their success or failure, the experiences and lessons learned by the masses themselves truly educated the masses. It enabled cadres to clarify the main direction of future efforts and to examine the actual implementation of relevant agricultural production policies, guidelines, and plans. This is a good way to lead agricultural production, and we must attach importance to it, study and improve it, gradually enhance it, and continue to achieve greater results. The following are some situations and problems based on incomplete materials from Qiu County, Shahe County, and Xingtai County in Hebei Province, for discussion in various regions.
            I. Some Situations of the Evaluation and Comparison Movement
    Qiu County, Shahe County, and Xingtai County in Hebei Province have made great achievements in this year's evaluation and comparison movement, especially in educating the masses, improving cadres, and establishing a certain foundation for the implementation of policies and guidelines in the future and for agricultural production in 1951.
    (1) The evaluation and comparison movement proved the correctness of the government's leadership and call for mass production, strengthening the confidence of the masses. For example, Xiaowang Village in Xingtai First District planted 309 mu of cotton this year in response to the government's call. After comparing planting cotton with planting sorghum (the village used to plant sorghum), the average yield of sorghum was six dou per mu, while the average yield of cotton was 131 jin per mu. After careful calculation, deducting the entire income from sorghum with 50 jin of seed cotton per mu, there was still a net surplus of 81 jin. The 309 mu of cotton fields increased the income by a total of 77,250 jin of millet. The masses reflected: "Listening to the government's call pays off, those who don't listen suffer." Wu Wenzao of Mabao Village in Qiu County Second District, after comparing cotton planting with and without pruning, said: "I didn't believe in the leadership in the past, thinking that everyone knows how to produce, and the leaders only add trouble. This year, the higher authorities proposed pruning the cotton branches, and I responded to the call and pruned the branches. It's really good, each mu yielded an extra 10 to 20 jin of cotton." Dongjiujia Village in Shahe County used to harvest only one cloth bag (equivalent to eight dou) of sorghum per mu. This year, they planted 1,254 mu of cotton, with an average yield of more than 100 jin per mu, and the total income was equivalent to about 450,000 jin of millet, fully confirming that the saying "to get rich, grow cotton" is absolutely correct. After the masses evaluated, compared, and calculated accounts, they unanimously reflected: "The government's call is right."
    (2) The evaluation and comparison movement can further implement production policies and make the masses realize the benefits of being organized. Dukou Village in Shahe County, with a total of 540 households, overcame production difficulties by organizing mutual aid teams (a total of 16 mutual aid teams, further divided into subgroups), rationally used labor, achieved intensive cultivation, improved technology, and gradually enriched their lives. In terms of livestock alone, the village has increased from 170 heads in 1943 to the current 493 heads. Heilu Village, with 27 households, organized three mutual aid teams, and over the past five or six years, they have also increased from six heads of livestock to 58 heads, and also raised 470 sheep. Because Qiu County's Dongliang'erzhuang Village was too dry to plant sweet potatoes, Geng Zhijiang's mutual aid team was able to concentrate manpower and carry water to plant sweet potatoes in a timely manner, resulting in excellent growth. Those working individually could not carry water in time to plant, and even after changing the soil, the plants did not survive. After similar comparisons in various regions, the benefits of being organized were generally recognized, and various forms of mutual aid teams were formed. According to statistics from Shahe County, after the evaluation and comparison, the percentage of households participating in mutual aid teams was 80% in the old areas and 50% in the semi-old areas. In Xiaowang Village, Xingtai First District, 136 households formed 39 mutual aid teams, accounting for more than 65% of the total number of households in the village.
    (3) After the evaluation and comparison, the masses' idea of relying on the heavens for food was reversed, and they began to attach importance to improving technology. (1) Seed selection: When the Si Zi Er B cotton seeds were first lent out in Qiu County, most of the masses were unwilling to accept them. After the evaluation and comparison, they realized that the Si Zi Er B cotton indeed had a higher yield than the small flower variety, and with the difference in price, planting the small flower variety would result in half the income. Therefore, they unanimously requested to switch to planting Si Zi Er B cotton next year. Hu Peiyi's "Jin Miao Huang" millet in Xiaowang Village, Xingtai, had large ears and strong stalks, yielding 1.8 shi per mu (about 25 jin per dou); while Hu Qingsha's "Xiao Bai Gu," with the same soil quality and two more carts of fertilizer, yielded only 1.6 shi. After this evaluation and comparison, every household selected seeds in the field during the autumn harvest. 134 households selected a total of 1,125 jin of "Jin Miao Huang" millet seeds, and 74 households selected 1,365 jin of cotton seeds. After the evaluation and comparison in a village in Shahe County, seven women's mutual aid teams selected 2,269 jin of millet seeds and 1,039 jin of cotton seeds. (2) Fertilization: Li Xuezhi of Dongzhao Village in Shahe planted 4.5 mu of millet last year, applying only one cart of soil fertilizer per mu, and harvested a total of 4.5 cloth bags. This year, in addition to applying more soil fertilizer, he also bought 110 jin of white cake (sesame cake), and as a result, he harvested eight cloth bags. After this comparison, the entire village realized the benefits of increasing fertilizer application and has bought 100,000 jin of white cake. After the evaluation and comparison in Qiu County, the demand for rapeseed cake increased greatly, and the market price rose from more than 70,000 yuan per 100 jin to 140,000 yuan. (3) Technical management: Xing Lincheng of Guchengying in Qiu County planted five mu of Si Zi cotton, leaving sparse seedlings, about 1,000 plants per mu (the optimal number of plants per mu for maximum yield varies depending on soil quality, fertilizer, and other conditions, requiring more comparative research - editor). He hoed twice and then pruned the flower branches, and also promptly harvested the flower ears and topped the plants during the first fu, yielding 170 jin per mu, 80 jin more than the average household. Feng Xiuwen in Xingtai First District hoed his three mu of cotton eleven times, pruned the branches five times, and treated pests (aphids) in a timely manner. Even under severe pest conditions, he still harvested 140 jin per mu. At the same time, Zhao Xiang planted two mu of cotton, with better soil quality than Feng Xiuwen, but he only hoed three times before wheat harvest and did not prune the branches or treat pests in time, treating cotton planting as a "filling in the gaps" task, yielding only 75 jin per mu. After the evaluation and comparison, the reasons were found, making everyone realize the importance of mastering technology. They unanimously reflected that they should learn from technical experts and models, and cultivate good seeds to get a good harvest.
    (4) The evaluation and comparison can improve production enthusiasm and educate and transform lazy people. After the evaluation and comparison in various regions, the masses not only felt that labor was glorious and stimulated their enthusiasm for hard work, but also universally educated and transformed lazy people. For example, Bian Guimei of Renyizhuang in Qiu County First District used to be idle and did not engage in production. Through this evaluation and comparison, she was stimulated and determined to change and actively produce. Li Sanzhu of Taozhai in Qiu County Second District was disliked by the villagers for his laziness, and they did not compare with him, prompting him to take the initiative to express his attitude to the cadres and promise to actively produce in the future. Ju Maying of Hujialou in Xingtai only plowed but did not harrow his cotton field, and his management was lazy, failing to prune the cotton branches in time, yielding only 40 jin of cotton per mu. After the evaluation and comparison, he said that he would definitely strive to be better than the average household in the future.
    (5) Based on realistic achievements, various types of labor models were selected. In the past, the selection of labor models in some areas had the tendency of cadres arbitrarily designating or filling the positions with old labor models. This year, after the evaluation and comparison, this tendency was generally reversed. The masses basically recognized that the selection of labor models was to establish role models for everyone to learn from, and that being selected as a labor model was to lead everyone to produce well and live a good life, and therefore it was also a supreme honor. When Shahe County held a labor model conference, there were 89 models, all of whom were selected through evaluation and comparison. Among them, 62 were newly selected this year. The emergence of these women labor models demonstrated the importance of women in agricultural production and pointed out that women's participation in labor production could improve their social status, encouraging women's enthusiasm for participating in production. At the labor model conference, the models enthusiastically publicized their production techniques and experiences, educating the broad masses and cadres.
    (6) Cadres found technical guidance to be more difficult in leading production, and after this study, they all felt that they had gained experience. For example, Ni Qing (a new intellectual) in Qiu County Second District thought before the evaluation and comparison that "there is nothing to learn from the masses." After personally experiencing the evaluation and comparison, he said, "The masses' experience is too rich, and I am determined to learn from the masses in the future."
            II. Issues to Pay Attention to in the Evaluation and Comparison
    (1) We must review shortcomings on the basis of affirming achievements and inspiring production enthusiasm, in order to improve the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses. For example, a village in Shahe County was previously seen by the district as "all-around backward." At the same time, there were few district cadres, and they could only take a cursory look at production leadership. When they arrived at the village, they not only did not provide specific guidance, but only looked for shortcomings, which further affected the production enthusiasm of the village cadres and the masses. During the evaluation and comparison, it was discovered that 16 mutual aid teams in the village had persisted for several years without collapsing. This achievement was first affirmed, and models were selected, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the cadres and the masses to improve production and strengthened their confidence in seeking progress.
    (2) Combine the practical experience of the masses with scientific knowledge to improve agricultural technology. For example, during the evaluation and comparison movement in Qiu County, an evaluation and comparison committee (including villagers with production experience and progressive-minded individuals) was organized to affirm the correct experiences of the masses and criticize the incorrect ones. In Xichangzhuang, someone said that fertile land would only grow crazy branches and not peaches when planting cotton. Shi Rulin immediately put forward his own experience: "It's not that the land is fertile, but that the fertilizer applied is not right. Applying more sesame cake will grow more flowers and peaches. Only applying livestock manure and grass fertilizer will only grow branches and leaves." From this, it can be seen that the experience of the masses is very rich. Combining the practical experience of the masses with scientific knowledge can further improve production technology. (Generally, fertile land refers to land with a high nitrogen content, while cotton peaches need phosphorus fertilizer. The phosphorus content in sesame cake is 3.8-6.6%, which is about ten times higher than that of pig and cattle manure - editor)
    (3) Labor models are the backbone of the production movement. They play a leading and bridging role and are one of the important methods of leading the production movement. Combining the labor model movement with the evaluation and comparison movement, using labor models and carrying out evaluation and comparison, and selecting labor models through evaluation and comparison, can further strengthen their "role model" effect among the masses and expand the publicity and mobilization effect on the masses.
            III. Grasp Key Links and Pay Attention to Leadership
    The evaluation and comparison movement is a new mass movement for leading production developed from the past "comparing manure piles" and "comparing harvests." Therefore, at the beginning, cadres and the masses still had concerns in their thinking (such as fear of trouble, fear of increased burden, fear of losing face if the production was not good, and also fear of being selected as a model and delaying work due to attending too many meetings). Individual villages also became superficial due to unfamiliarity with the work and lack of specific guidance from higher authorities. Therefore, to carry out the evaluation and comparison movement well, we must pay attention to grasping several key links:
    (1) Make cadres and the masses clearly recognize the purpose and significance of the evaluation and comparison movement. For example, in Qiu County, Hebei Province, at the beginning of deploying this work, they conducted in-depth publicity and mobilization, first conveying the spirit of the evaluation and comparison movement to the cadres, and using specific examples to point out that the evaluation and comparison not only exchanged the production experiences of the masses, but also enriched the leadership methods. For the masses, it was linked to their own vital interests, explaining that finding the reasons for the success or failure of crops through evaluation and comparison was a good way to learn how to farm and reach the path to greater wealth. At the same time, policy education was carried out, pointing out that good crops are only glorious and do not increase the burden; as for bad crops, finding the reasons for the failure, learning from each other's strengths to make up for weaknesses, can also grow good land next year. After this in-depth mobilization, the evaluation and comparison movement in the entire county can be quickly and smoothly launched.
    (2) In terms of methods, there should be organization, leadership, and steps. County and district cadres should personally take action, select key villages, understand the situation, discover problems, create experience, and then promote the general. Work in key villages should be good and fast. When holding a summary, absorb cadres from neighboring villages to participate and learn from experience. Or make notifications and introductions, convene village meetings, and exchange the experience of key villages in a timely manner. In each village, first clarify the purpose and significance of the evaluation and comparison through the village branch, and then convene a meeting of cadres from various departments (village administration, farmers' association, women's federation, militia), organize party members, cadres, and activists to form a core leadership, and use group discussions or individual talks to clarify ideas. After thorough deliberation, start the evaluation and comparison in the group; party members and cadres should play a leading role during the evaluation and comparison in order to encourage the masses to talk about the success or failure of their crops and the reasons, and to launch a heated discussion and comparison, and to have the courage to compete for models. After the group evaluation and comparison is completed, convene a mass meeting, where typical individuals from each group report on their production situation and experience, and after discussion and comparison by the masses, various types of labor models are produced.
    (3) The content of the evaluation and comparison should be specifically determined according to the actual situation and conditions of each region, and targeted at the season and object, consciously, purposefully, and centrally. On the one hand, find out the reasons for the success or failure in current production, and on the other hand, clearly point out the main direction of future efforts (such as proposing a comparison between planting cotton and planting grain in areas suitable for cotton planting, and proposing a comparison between mutual aid and individual work in order to implement production policies). Show the leadership role of the Party and the government from the evaluation and comparison, and further strengthen the relationship between the Party and the government and the masses.

　　必须重视评比运动
　　汪冠群
    今年八、九月间，华北若干地区的农村曾结合生产检查和三秋运动，发动了一个广泛的农业生产评比运动。这个运动因为是在土地改革已经完成，封建剥削制度业被摧毁，农民经济生活已逐渐好转的情况下开展起来的，所以群众基础极为广泛，农民结合自己的实际经验进行评比，对提高生产技术有着重大的作用。
    评比运动是一个群众性的运动，通过这个运动使每一阶段的农业生产得到一个群众性的总结。在领导农业生产方法上，这也是一个走群众路线的具体形式。在评比过程中，由于比庄稼好坏，找出其好坏的原因，真正的做到了以群众亲身体会的经验教训，教育了群众，使干部明确了今后主要努力的方向，检查了有关农业生产政策，方针，计划的实际贯彻程度。这是领导农业生产的一个好方式，我们必须重视，必须加以研究改进，逐步提高，继续取得更大的效果。下面仅就河北省邱县、沙河、邢台三县的不完全材料，提出一些情况和问题，供各地研讨。
            一、评比运动的一些情况
    河北省邱县、沙河、邢台三县，在今年的评比运动中有很大成就，尤其是在教育群众、提高干部以及今后贯彻政策方针，和一九五一年的农业生产上，建立了一定程度的基础。
    （一）从评比运动中，证明了政府领导与号召群众生产的正确，加强了群众的信心。如邢台一区小汪村今年响应政府号召种了三○九亩棉花，经过种棉与种高粱的对比（该村过去习惯种植高粱），高粱平均每亩收六斗，棉花平均每亩收一三一斤，算了细账，每亩以五○斤籽花抵补高粱的全部收入，还净剩八一斤，三○九亩的棉田就合共增加了七七、二五○斤小米的收益。群众反映：“听政府号召的都上算，没听的都吃了亏”。邱县二区马堡村吴文早经过种棉打杈与不打杈的对比后说：“我过去不相信领导，认为谁不知道生产，领导只是添麻烦，今年上级提出打花杈，我响应了号召，把花杈打了，可不坏，每亩就多收了一二十斤花”。沙河县东九家村，过去群众种高粱每亩只打一布袋（合八斗），今年种了一、二五四亩棉花，平均每亩能收一百多斤，全部收入约合四十五万斤小米，充分证实了“要发家种棉花”这句话一点也不错。群众经评比算账后，一致反映：“政府的号召就是对”。
    （二）评比运动可以进一步贯彻生产方针，使群众认识组织起来的好处。沙河县渡口村，全村五四○户，经过组织起互助组（共组成十六个互助组，组内再分小组），克服了生产中的困难，合理使用了劳力，做到精耕细作，提高技术，生活逐渐富裕。现在仅是牲口一项，该村已由一九四三年的一七○头增加到现在的四九三头。黑璃村二十七户，组织了三个互助组，五六年来也由六头牲口增加到五八头，还喂了四七○只羊。邱县东梁二庄因天旱种不上红薯，耿志江的互助组因为组织起来能集中使用人力，及时担水种红薯，结果生长极良好。单干的不能及时担水抢种，虽经换土也未成活。各地区经过类似的对比，一般都认识了组织起来的好处，组成了各种不同形式的互助组。据沙河县的统计，评比后全县参加互助的，老区占总户数百分之八○，半老区百分之五○，邢台一区小汪村一三六户组成了三十九个互助组，占全村总户数百分之六五强。
    （三）经过评比扭转了群众靠天吃饭的思想，开始重视提高技术。（１）选种：邱县在最初贷放斯字二Ｂ棉种时，群众多不愿接受，经过评比，认识斯字二Ｂ棉确实比小花产量高，再加价格上的差别，种小花要少一半的收入，因而一致要求明年都换种斯字二Ｂ棉。邢台小汪村胡培益的“金苗黄”谷，穗大秆强，一亩打一石八斗（每斗约二十五斤）；而胡庆沙种的“小白谷”，地质相同，还多上了两车粪，却只打一石六斗。经此评比，秋收中做到户户进行田间选种，一三四户共选了一、一二五斤“金苗黄”谷种，七四户选了一、三六五斤棉种。沙河县某村经过评比，七个妇女互助组就选了二、二六九斤谷种，和一、○三九斤棉种。（二）施肥：沙河东赵村李学之，去年种四亩半谷，每亩只上了一车多土粪，共打了四布袋半，今年除多上了土粪，还买了一一○斤白饼（芝麻饼），结果打了八布袋。经此对比，全村认识了增施肥料的好处，已买了十万斤白饼。邱县经评比后，菜籽饼需要量大增，市价由七万余元一百斤涨到十四万元。（三）技术管理：邱县古城营邢林成的五亩斯字棉，留的苗稀，每亩合一千株（到底每亩多少株收量大，根据土质肥料等条件而不同，须要更多的比较研究——编者），锄两遍后就打了花杈，又抓紧了拿花耳，头伏时打了尖，每亩收一七○斤，比一般户能多收八○斤。邢台一区冯修文三亩棉，锄十一遍，打枝整枝五次，及时治虫（蚜虫），虽在虫害严重的情况下，每亩还收了一四○斤。同时赵祥种二亩棉，地质比冯修文的好，但仅麦前锄了三遍，又未及时打整治虫，把种棉当做“补空”活，每亩只收七五斤。经过评比，找出原因，使大家都认识到掌握技术的重要。一致反映，要向技术能手和模范们学习，好好养种才能多收。
    （四）评比能提高生产热情，教育和改造懒汉。各地经过评比，群众不仅感到劳动光荣，激发了努力生产的热情，还普遍的教育和改造了懒汉。如邱县一区仁义庄边桂梅，过去游手好闲不事生产；通过这次评比，受到刺激，决心转变，积极生产。二区桃砦李三珠，村中群众嫌他平日懒惰，不给他比，引起他自动找干部表明态度，今后决心积极生产。邢台胡家楼聚马英种棉地只耕不耙，管理上疏懒，不及时打整棉枝，每亩只收四十多斤花，经过评比后，表示今后一定争取比上一般户。
    （五）根据现实成果，评选了各种类型的劳动模范。过去评选劳动模范，个别地区曾有干部包办指定，或以旧劳动模范充数的偏向，今年经评比后，一般是扭转了这个偏向。群众基本上认识了评选劳动模范是树立大家学习的榜样，当选劳动模范是带动大家好好生产，都能过好光景，因此也是无上的光荣。沙河县开劳动模范大会时，有八十九位模范，都是经过评比生产而被选上的，其中六十二位是今年新选出的。邱县仅二区三十二个村就选出村模范二百零二位，其中妇女生产模范有三十二位。这些妇女劳动模范的产生，既说明了妇女在农业生产上的重要性，也指出了妇女参加了劳动生产就能提高其社会地位，鼓舞了妇女参加生产的热情。在劳模会上，模范们都尽情的宣扬了自己的生产技术和经验，教育了广大群众和干部。
    （六）干部在领导生产上较为困难的是技术指导，经过这个学习，都觉得有了本钱。如邱县二区干部倪清（新知识分子），在评比前认为“向群众没啥学头”，经过评比亲身体验后，却说“群众经验太丰富了，今后要决心向群众学习”。
            二、评比中应注意的问题
    （一）要在肯定成绩，启发生产热情的基础上检讨缺点，才能提高干部和群众的积极性。如沙河县某村，过去区里的印象是“一切落后”，同时区干部数量少，平时领导生产只能走马观花，到了村不但没给具体指导，反而只找缺点，因而更加影响了村干部和群众的生产情绪。在评比时发现该村有十六个互助组坚持数年一直未垮，先就肯定了这项成绩，并评选了模范，因而大大的鼓舞了干部和群众搞好生产的热情，加强了他们求进步的信心。
    （二）把群众中的实践经验和科学知识结合起来，把农业技术提高一步。如邱县在评比运动中，曾组织评比委员会（包括本村有生产经验，思想前进分子），将群众的正确经验加以肯定，不正确的加以批判。在西常庄有人说，地壮种棉就光长疯杈不长桃，石汝林马上提出自己经验：“不是地壮而是上的肥不对头，多上芝麻饼就能多长花桃，只上牲口粪，草酵肥，就会光长枝叶”。从这里就可以看出群众的经验是很丰富的。把群众的实践经验和科学知识结合起来，就能更使生产技术提高一步。（一般指的肥地是氮肥多，而棉桃需要磷肥，芝麻饼中磷的含量是百分之三·八——六·六，比猪牛粪高达十倍左右——编者）
    （三）劳动模范是生产运动中的骨干，他起着带头和桥梁的作用，是领导生产运动的重要方法之一。劳模运动与评比运动结合起来，运用劳模、开展评比，经过评比选出劳模，更能加强其在群众中的“榜样”作用，对群众也能更加扩大宣传鼓动的效果。
            三、抓紧重要环节，注意领导
    评比运动是由过去“比粪堆”、“比收成”发展起来的一个新的领导生产的群众运动，因此在开始之初，干部和群众们在思想上还存在着顾虑（如怕麻烦，怕增加负担，怕比出生产不好没面子，也有怕被选上模范开会多误了工的），也有个别村由于工作生疏，上级又没有注意具体指导，因而流于形式的。因此，搞好评比运动要注意掌握几个重要的环节：
    （一）使干部和群众明确认识评比运动的目的与意义。如河北省邱县，在布置这个工作之初，就深入宣传动员，首先对干部们传达评比运动的精神，并用具体实例指出经过评比既交流了群众生产经验，又丰富了领导方法。对群众则与其切身利益联系起来，说明经过评比找出庄稼好坏的原因，是学习种地的好办法，达到更加富裕的门径。同时进行政策教育，指出庄稼好只有光荣，并不增加负担；至于庄稼孬，找出孬的原因，互相取长补短，明年就也能种好了地。全县评比运动经此深入动员，就能很快的顺利展开。
    （二）在方法上要有组织，有领导，有步骤。县区干部应亲自下手，选择重点村，掌握情况，发现问题，创造经验，再推动一般。重点村工作要好要快，举行总结时吸取邻近各村干部参加，学习经验。或通报介绍，召开片村会，及时交流重点村经验。在各村中，首先通过村支部，搞清楚评比目的及意义，再召开各部门干部会（村行政，农会，妇联，民兵），组织党员，干部，积极分子形成核心领导，用小组座谈会或个别谈话的方式打通思想。经酝酿成熟，再开始由小组中评比；评比时党员干部应起带头作用，才能鼓励群众说出自己庄稼好坏及其原因，展开热烈的讨论比较，而有竞选模范的勇气，小组评比完毕，再召开群众会，由各小组中的典型报告自己的生产情况和经验，经由群众讨论比较，产生出各类型的劳动模范。
    （三）评比的内容，应根据各地区实际情况与条件，针对季节与对象，有意识，有目的，有中心的加以具体决定。一面找出当前生产中成功失败的原因，一面明确指出今后主要努力的方向（如在适宜种棉区域，应提出种棉与种谷的对比，为了贯彻生产方针，应提出互助与单干的对比）。从评比中显示出党与政府的领导作用，更进一步密切党和政府与群众间的关系。
