　　How the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement Was Carried Out at Beijing No. 8 Middle School
　　When the Resist America, Aid Korea movement began at Beijing No. 8 Middle School, the ideological understanding of the teachers and students was very inconsistent. The majority of students were angered by the increasingly close approach of the American imperialist war flames to the motherland's borders; however, a small number of students and most of the teaching staff did not have a sufficient understanding of this American imperialist conspiracy, and therefore felt that it was premature to propose Resist America, Aid Korea at this time. Some people even feared that this would cause a third world war. Some teachers and staff were also afraid that the launch of the Resist America, Aid Korea movement in the school would affect the completion of the teaching plan; some students were also afraid of delaying their studies and failing to get into university. Even among the students who had already requested the implementation of Resist America, Aid Korea, their thinking was not clear enough. Most people only knew that American imperialism wanted to invade our country and must be resisted, but they could not explain many reasons. In short, hatred, contempt, and disdain for American imperialism were still somewhat empty concepts for a large number of people.
　　Therefore, the leading cadres of No. 8 Middle School organized students and teachers to conduct current affairs study in order to improve everyone's ideological awareness. Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members were the first to study. The whole school also launched a widespread study movement of reading and discussing various documents and materials. In this study movement, attention was paid to avoiding empty debates of "right and wrong" or "should and shouldn't," and to realistically solving everyone's ideological problems. In the discussions, Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members guided everyone to study history and understand the problem from many specific facts. During World War II, the great Soviet Red Army defeated the German fascist bandits in Europe, liberated the people of Eastern European countries, and helped them establish democratic regimes. In Asia, it defeated Japanese imperialism and liberated the people of Northeast China and the Korean people who had been enslaved by Japanese bandits for a long time. Could this be considered aggression? Many Korean brothers bravely participated in China's War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. They not only fought side by side with our soldiers, but also shed blood and sacrificed with our martyrs. Were they also invading us or interfering in our internal affairs? At the same time, the facts of the US imperialism launching and expanding its war of aggression were studied: the US air force repeatedly invaded our Northeast airspace to bomb and strafe, and the US Seventh Fleet occupied our Taiwan. This made the majority of students realize from historical facts that our aid to the Korean people's struggle was a just act, not only because Korea is our closest neighbor, but also to defend the motherland and defend world peace. Wang Jiuhua, a student in the second year of senior high school, originally advocated waiting until the US military crossed the Yalu River before resisting. After studying, he realized: Why wait until the fire burns on your own house before putting it out? So he actively participated in the propaganda work of Resist America, Aid Korea. There were also some people who were originally afraid of delaying their studies, but now they understand that Resist America, Aid Korea, defending the country and protecting the home is a very important lesson, which is precisely for better learning in the future. Using this method, the vast majority of students initially reached a consensus that Resist America, Aid Korea is to defend the country and protect the home. Most of them were able to combine their own feelings and thoughts, and their understanding of the issue began to become more in-depth and specific. The anti-American accusation meeting held by all students on the 27th of last month was proof of this. After the news of Foreign Minister Zhou's repeated telegrams to the United Nations protesting the US planes' repeated harassment of our Northeast airspace from October 13th to 25th and the US imperialist troops approaching our national border was published in this newspaper, the students could no longer bear it. Crying and shouting, they asked to go out to publicize and tell all citizens that the bloody hands of the US imperialists had reached out to our motherland and could no longer be ignored. At this time, some people asked to hold a conference to accuse the crimes of US imperialism. So, the accusation meeting was held first. At the meeting, all the students scrambled to accuse the crimes of imperialism. A little student named Zhang Zhenguo accused the US-made Chiang Kai-shek planes of bombing Tang County and killing many of his classmates, and he vowed to avenge these little brothers. Zeng Aimei, a student who returned from Malaya, told everyone how imperialism was bullying and insulting overseas Chinese. Under the rule of imperialism, three or five overseas Chinese could not talk together, otherwise they would be rudely interfered with by the imperialist military police. Once, even the overseas Chinese in a city were driven out, and everyone's property was robbed. Teacher Zhang Sanyuan also excitedly accused the US military jeep of running over his brother. This caused all the students to burst into tears. Finally, they unanimously solemnly swore to dedicate everything to the motherland. This accusation meeting not only further promoted the students' patriotic enthusiasm, but also stimulated the patriotic enthusiasm of the teaching staff (the teaching staff union also held a teaching staff Resist America, Aid Korea accusation meeting that afternoon). And this meeting did not go through any preparations such as arranging the venue, posting slogans, drafting slogans, or mobilizing speeches in advance. That night, the students of Class D of the third grade of junior high school also automatically held a discussion to review and correct the phenomenon of disunity among themselves, and in the future, they would unite to resist America, aid Korea, defend the country and protect the home.
　　After the anti-American accusation meeting, the student union and the Communist Youth League branch, in order to consolidate this anti-American, aid-Korea sentiment and continue to improve everyone's awareness, organized all the students to study the history of American imperialism's aggression against China in depth, and combined it with collecting US imperialist atrocities, so that everyone could more systematically understand the hideous face of American imperialism's aggression against China and the purpose of this invasion of Korea. At the same time, they continuously studied articles such as "How to Understand the United States," "Exposing the Paper Tiger," and "Q&A on the Atomic Bomb."
　　In this period of study, the school's leading cadres were also able to promptly discover a shortcoming, that is, the teachers and staff's study was not combined enough with the students' study. In the movement, the general teachers and staff were slower to become aware; however, because the students' own reading ability was limited and their social knowledge was insufficient, some problems could not be solved without the help of the teachers and staff. In this way, the level of awareness of the teachers and staff must be rapidly improved, and the current affairs study of the teachers and staff and the current affairs study of the students must be closely integrated to promote each other.
　　After the accusation meeting, the teachers and staff's level of awareness has been improved. But simply accusing the US military of atrocities cannot completely solve the problem. Because some people regard these atrocities as individual phenomena, the study committee and the teachers and staff union launched the teachers and staff to study the history of US imperialism's aggression against China to help them systematically and essentially understand the true face of US imperialism's aggression against China. Because they have personally experienced the loveliness of the motherland in the year and a half since liberation, they have established a sense of national self-esteem. After studying, many people have become activists in the movement. An old teacher surnamed Chen felt very happy and satisfied when reading the People's Daily editorial "Crush the Enemy's Slander, Deception, and Intimidation." Especially when he recited "Are you not convinced? Eloquent facts will make you kneel down and surrender," he felt that his back, which had been bent by imperialism and its running dogs, straightened up, how could he not be excited?! What he had seen in the past was only his own country being enslaved by imperialism, and the traitorous government of Chiang Kai-shek kowtowing to imperialism. Another old teacher said, "I have taught for decades, but I don't know what the children I taught in the past will do. The country is so corrupt, those warlords and bureaucrats are always fighting each other, and watching the children I taught being either bullied by foreigners or killing each other, I feel really sad..." But now, the old teachers see how much their students love the motherland, and now they are enthusiastically working to resist the aggression of US imperialism. The old teachers are excited, and they are working enthusiastically to defend the motherland like the children. They painstakingly go out to conduct street propaganda with the students, and draw cartoons and write clapper rhymes with the students. A female math teacher, also from the history of US imperialism's aggression against China, realized the true face of US imperialism's aggression against China, and she also said angrily: As a Chinese, she did not know the aggression of US imperialism against China. She said that when the country needs her, she can leave her only child and dedicate herself to the motherland. In the past, she loved her child the most. She said that in the past she could not imagine what would happen to a child without a mother? Now she has figured it out: A child without a motherland is more painful than a child without a mother, they will live a life of slavery.
　　After the teachers and staff's ideological awareness was improved, it was of great help to the students' current affairs study. The history teacher lectured on the history of US imperialism's aggression against China and on Qin Shi Huang, criticizing the error of the theory of weapons; the geography teacher lectured on the situation of the Korean War, explaining how US imperialism established military bases all over the world, and so on. Therefore, the students' learning went a step further. However, the teachers and staff's understanding of US imperialism mostly remains at the theoretical level, and has not yet been universally combined with personal thoughts and feelings, and various methods must be used to continue to improve the level of awareness.
　　According to the experience of No. 8 Middle School, in the process of ideological education, it is necessary to pay attention to preventing impatience, otherwise it will cause a part of the masses who are relatively slow to become ideologically aware to fall behind the movement. In the study, a small number of students in the Eighth Middle School were not active enough and lagged behind the general students. At this time, some students disliked them for being backward. At this time, Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members paid attention to persuading everyone's impatience, and tried various methods to help these relatively backward students study. After they had a certain awareness, they were assigned certain work according to their specialties. Some wrote big-character posters, some drew cartoons, and some wrote clapper rhymes. When they encountered difficulties in their work, they were helped to solve them. When they made a little achievement, they were given encouragement. In this way, some people who were originally very backward also became activists or very good propagandists. Secondly, any action must be based on the conscious and voluntary basis of the masses. When the students decided to launch street propaganda on November 10th, the teachers and staff also requested to participate. However, there were disagreements in the discussion. Some advocated going to the streets with the students to carry out masquerade propaganda, some advocated conducting home visits, and some advocated free participation. At this time, the teachers and staff union paid attention to everyone's ideological situation and did not force a consensus, announcing: voluntary participation, free choice of propaganda methods. This makes it possible for teachers and students who are not aware enough to be free from any pressure in the movement to avoid retreating halfway; at the same time, it is also easy to gradually win over the relatively backward teachers and students to participate in the movement.
　　At present, the school continues to carry out propaganda work to resist America and aid Korea, while learning useful scientific knowledge, and preparing to respond to all calls from the motherland and serve the motherland at any time.

### 北京市第八中学的抗美援朝运动是怎样开展的

　　北京市第八中学的抗美援朝运动是怎样开展的
    北京市第八中学抗美援朝运动开始时，全校师生思想认识是很不一致的，多数同学已为美帝国主义的侵略战火日益烧近祖国国境而激怒起来；但是有一少部分同学和大部分教职员对于美帝国主义这种侵略阴谋还认识不足，因而感到现在提出抗美援朝未免过早。并有人害怕因此会引起第三次世界大战。另有些教职员还怕学校开展抗美援朝运动后影响教学计划的完成；同学中也有怕耽误功课考不上大学。就是在已经要求实行抗美援朝的同学中，思想也还是不够明确的，大部分人只知道美帝国主义要侵略我国，必须进行抵抗，但说不出多少道理来。总之，仇视、鄙视和蔑视美帝国主义，在很大一部分人中，还只是一些较为空洞的概念。
    因此，第八中学领导干部就组织学生和教职员进行时事学习，以此来提高大家的思想觉悟。共产党员和青年团员首先进行学习。全校也就展开了广泛地阅读和讨论各种文件和资料的学习运动。在这学习运动中，注意避免了“对与不对”或“应该与不应该”的空洞争论，实事求是来解决每个人的思想问题。讨论中，共产党员和青年团员引导大家研究历史，从许多具体事实中认识这个问题，第二次世界大战时伟大的苏联红军在欧洲打垮了德国法西斯强盗，解放了东欧各国的人民，并帮助他们建立了民主政权；在亚洲又击败了日本帝国主义，解放了长期受日寇奴役的中国的东北人民和朝鲜人民，这难道算是侵略？许多朝鲜弟兄英勇地参加中国的抗日战争和解放战争，他们不但和我们的战士并肩作战，并且和我们的先烈一起流血牺牲，难道他们也是为了侵略我们或干涉我们的内政吗？同时研究了美帝发动并扩大侵略战争的事实：美国空军屡次侵入我东北领空轰炸扫射，美国第七舰队侵占我台湾。这样使大多数同学从历史事实中认识了我们援助朝鲜人民斗争是正义的行动，不仅是因为朝鲜是我们最近的邻人，并且是为了保卫祖国，保卫世界和平。高二的一位王九华同学原先是主张等美军过鸭绿江后再抵抗的。他经过学习后认识到：为什么非要等火烧到自己的房子上时再去扑灭呢？于是他积极的参加了抗美援朝的宣传工作。还有一些原来怕耽误功课的人，现在也明白了，抗美援朝保家卫国就是很重要的一课，这正为了今后能够更好的学习。采用了这种方法，使绝大多数同学对抗美援朝就是为了保家卫国的认识初步获得一致。其中大多数同学并能结合自己的感情思想，对问题的认识开始深入具体。上月二十七日全校同学召开的抗美控诉大会就是一个证明。在本报发表了周外长再次致电联合国抗议美机十月十三日至二十五日多次袭扰我东北领空的消息和美帝侵朝部队迫近我国国境的新闻后，同学们再也忍受不住了。他们哭着喊着要求出去宣传告诉全体市民，美帝的血手已伸向我们的祖国，再也不能置之不理了。这时又有人要求开大会控诉美帝罪行。于是首先召开了控诉大会。会上，全体同学争先恐后地控诉帝国主义罪行。有一位叫张振国的小同学控诉美制蒋机在唐县城炸死了他们很多同学，他要坚决为这些小弟弟复仇。一位从马来亚回国的曾爱美同学，告诉大家帝国主义是怎样欺凌侮辱侨胞的，在帝国主义统治下，三五个侨胞不能在一起讲话，否则就被帝国主义的军警蛮横干涉。有一次甚至把一个城里的侨胞都赶出去，抢走了大家的财物。教员张三元也激动地控诉美军吉普车怎样轧死他的弟弟。这时引起了全体同学嚎啕大哭。最后一致庄严宣誓要为祖国献出自己的一切，这个控诉大会不但使同学们的爱国主义的热情有了进一步的高涨，并且激发了教职员的爱国情绪（当天下午教职员工会也召开了教职员抗美控诉大会）。而这个会议事先并没有经过什么布置会场、贴标语、拟口号、动员讲话等准备工作。当天晚上，初三丁班的同学还自动召开了座谈会，检讨纠正相互间不团结的现象，今后要团结起来抗美援朝，保家卫国。
    在抗美控诉大会以后，学生会和青年团支部为了巩固这种抗美援朝情绪和继续提高大家的觉悟，又组织全体同学深入学习美帝国主义侵华史，结合搜集美帝暴行，使大家更系统地认识了美帝国主义侵略中国的狰狞面目和这一次侵略朝鲜的目的。同时不断地学习“怎样认识美国”，“揭穿纸老虎”及“原子弹问答”等文章。
    学校领导干部在这一段学习中，又能够及时发现了一个缺点，就是教职员的学习与同学的学习还结合的不够。运动中一般教职员觉悟较慢；但是学生中因为自己阅读能力有限，社会知识不够，有些问题得不到教职员的帮助而无法解决。这样必须把教职员的觉悟程度迅速提高一步，并将教职员的时事学习和学生的时事学习密切结合起来，以便互相推动。
    教职员经过控诉大会后，觉悟程度已有所提高。但只控诉美军暴行，还不能完全解决问题。因为有些人把这些暴行当作个别现象，因此学委会和教职员工会便发动教职员学习美帝侵华史，帮助他们系统地和本质地认识美帝侵略中国的真面目。由于他们在解放后一年多的时间中，亲身体验到祖国的可爱，已树立起民族自尊心。经过学习后就有不少人成为运动中的积极分子。一位姓陈的老教员读人民日报《粉碎敌人的诬蔑，欺骗和恐吓》的社论时，觉得非常痛快和满意。特别是朗诵到“你们不服吗？雄辩的事实会让你们屈膝授首”，感觉到被帝国主义及其走狗压弯了的腰板都挺起来了，他怎么能不兴奋呢？！他过去所看到的只是自己的祖国受帝国主义的奴役，蒋介石卖国政府向帝国主义的屈膝授首。另一位老教员谈，“我已教过几十年书，可是我不知道我过去教出去的孩子们将干些什么。国家是那么腐败，那些军阀官僚总在自己打自己，眼看着自己教出来的孩子不是被外国人欺侮，就是自相残杀，心里实在难过……”而现在呢，老教员看到自己教出来的孩子，是怎样的热爱祖国，现在为抵抗美帝国主义的侵略，热情地工作，老教员们激动了，他们和孩子们一样地为保卫祖国热情地工作着。他们不辞劳苦地跟同学们一块出去进行街头宣传，和同学们一起画漫画编快板。一位教数学的女教员，同样地从美帝侵华史中认识了美帝侵略中国的真面目，她也愤恨地说：生为一个中国人，却不知道美帝国主义对中国的侵略。她表示在国家需要她的时候，她可以丢下她唯一的孩子献身于祖国。过去她是最爱她的孩子的。她说过去她不能想像没有妈妈的孩子将怎么办？现在她想通了：没有祖国的孩子比没有妈妈的孩子更痛苦，他们将会过着奴隶的生活。
    在教职员的思想觉悟提高以后，对同学们的时事学习便有不少帮助。历史教员讲美帝侵华史，并讲秦始皇，批判了唯武器论思想的错误；地理教员讲授朝鲜战争形势，讲解美帝怎样在全世界建立军事基地等。因此使同学们的学习深入一步。但是，教职员对美帝的认识，目前大多停留在理论方面，还没有普遍地和个人的思想感情结合起来，还须运用各种方法，继续提高觉悟程度。
    根据第八中学的经验，在思想教育过程中，必须注意防止急燥情绪，否则就会使一部分思想觉悟比较迟缓的群众落在运动后面。八中同学在学习中曾有一小部分同学不够积极，落后于一般同学。这时有些同学便嫌他们落后。共产党员和青年团员这时就注意说服大家的急燥情绪，想各种办法帮助这些较落后的同学学习，在他们有一定觉悟后，并根据他们的特长分给他们一定的工作，有的写大字报，有的画漫画，有的写快板。当他们在工作中发生困难时，帮助他们解决。当他们做出一点成绩时，给予鼓励。这样有些本来很落后的人，也成为积极分子或很好的宣传员。其次，任何行动必须建立在群众自觉自愿的基础上。十一月十日同学们决定展开街头宣传时，教职员也要求参加。但在讨论中意见不一致，有的主张和同学一起到街头化装宣传，有的主张进行家庭访问，有的主张自由参加。这时教职员工会注意了大家的思想情况而不强求一致，宣布：自愿参加，宣传方式自由选择。这样就使得觉悟还不够高的教员、学生在运动中不受任何压力以免中途退缩；同时也便于逐步争取比较落后的教员和学生参加运动。
    目前，该校一方面继续进行抗美援朝的宣传工作，一方面学习有用的科学知识，准备随时响应祖国一切号召为祖国服务。
