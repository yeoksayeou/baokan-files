Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The entire staff of the Civil Aviation Administration Bureau of the Central People's Government wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on the 9th of this month, the first anniversary of the uprising of the former China and Central Airlines, expressing their determination to resist America and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country. The letter, after describing how they were forced to work for American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang for more than 20 years, stated: We have deeply tasted the oppression and humiliation of American imperialism against us, and we have also recognized the aggressive ambitions of American imperialism against our sacred airspace and aviation rights. Therefore, on this anniversary of the Two Airlines Uprising, recalling the past, our old hatred has not gone away, and new hatred has arisen. Regarding aid to the Korean people who are suffering from the brutal massacre of American imperialism, the letter stated: Our two countries, China and Korea, have historically been as close as lips and teeth. Since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, we have jointly resisted aggression. During the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan and the four-year People's Liberation War, the people of our two countries, China and Korea, shed blood together. Now that American imperialism is invading Korea, we must not sit idly by. The letter finally swore to Chairman Mao: In our future work, we will fulfill the responsibilities of our patriotic people, and strive to drive away American imperialism, aid the liberation of the Korean people, defend our motherland, defend our hometowns, and defend world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th: The Shanghai Office of the Civil Aviation Administration Bureau of the Central People's Government held a grand gathering on the 9th of this month to celebrate the anniversary of the uprising of the former China and Central Airlines, and held a naming ceremony for the "Shanghai" aircraft at Longhua Airport. The "Shanghai" aircraft was pieced together and repaired by worker Yu Yongquan of the Shanghai Office of the Civil Aviation Administration Bureau from discarded materials abandoned by the Kuomintang government. At the beginning of the ceremony, Pan Hannian, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, cut the ribbon for the aircraft. At the meeting, Ge Yanzhang, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Civil Aviation Administration Bureau, pointed out: The completion of the "Shanghai" aircraft shows that the Chinese people can completely rely on themselves to build their own civil aviation industry without relying on imperialism. He solemnly stated regarding the unreasonable detention and destruction of the aircraft and equipment left in Hong Kong by the two airlines under the instigation of American imperialism by the British authorities in Hong Kong: The Chinese people must recover this property of their motherland.
