　　Nanjing Educational and Scientific Workers, Based on Personal Experience in the US,
　  Accuse American Imperialism of Crimes of Aggression Against China
　　[Report from this newspaper] On the afternoon of the 6th, people from the educational and scientific circles in Nanjing held a symposium on resisting American aggression, aiding Korea, protecting our homes, and defending our country. Those who attended included Pan Shu, Li Fangxun, Lü Jiong, Chen Zhongfan, Chen Heqin, Xiao Qianchun, Wu Zhaosu, and more than 150 others. During the meeting, educational and scientific workers, based on their personal experiences, exposed and accused the insidious methods of American imperialism in its aggression against China and the darkness of American society. They also spoke of what educational and scientific workers should strive for in the work of resisting American aggression, which is to eliminate pro-American and fear-of-America thoughts, and enhance their own and their students' hatred, contempt, and scorn for American imperialism.
　　　　American imperialism uses various insidious means to invade our country.
　　Chen Zungui and Xiao Qianchun of the Academy of Sciences both used specific examples to speak of the insidious and vicious methods of American imperialism in its aggression against our country. Chen Zungui said: "American imperialism uses various methods to invade us. Everyone knows that American imperialism once used education, science, religion, and other vicious methods in China, using the weapons of culture to penetrate our hearts. I remember that former US Ambassador to the Kuomintang government, John Leighton Stuart, ran Yenching University in China for decades. Now it is known that he was one of the heads of the US military's espionage network. They were merely using the name of running education as a tool of aggression, secretly carrying out espionage activities, which deceived some people who did not know, and even thought that the United States was good. Therefore, many people unconsciously developed pro-American thoughts." Xiao Qianchun said: "When I was studying in the United States, the US imperialists wanted me to collect materials on the climate of the Northeast and help the University of Maryland compile a map of Chinese minerals. I initially thought it was for purely academic research, but later I learned that most of the scientific research institutions in the United States are funded by the military and used for military purposes. Today, the flames of American imperialism's aggression have reached the doorstep of the Northeast. I have committed a crime against the people and the motherland (at this point, he choked up and shed tears). I am willing to atone for my sins in future work."
　　　　America's "democracy" and "freedom" are fake
　　When it came to America's "democracy" and "freedom," Xu Guoliang of Jinling University and Wu Zhaosu of Nanjing University both used specific examples to expose its hypocrisy. Xu Guoliang said: "Generally, people are misled by the scientific development of the United States, thinking that scientific development is everything, and yearning for America's so-called 'freedom' and 'democracy.' We can illustrate this with our own personal experiences: In the United States, two classmates and I wanted to go to Atomic City to study atomic energy courses, but we were rejected because we were Chinese. In fact, American scholars and professors thought it was ridiculous that we were refused to study atomic energy courses in Atomic City, because the atomic energy course classrooms are very far from the atomic bomb factory. This shows that the United States is not as free in science as we imagine. Furthermore, the fact that T.V.A.'s water is divided into white and colored people to drink further illustrates that the United States is not equal, free, or democratic." Wu Zhaosu continued: "Here I would like to cite a couple of facts to illustrate the actual situation in the United States: Chinese scientists and technicians studying in the United States once organized a tour of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) hydroelectric project to visit the site. As a result, we did not gain much technically, but we saw how American imperialism hinders scientific work. The Tennessee Valley Authority hydroelectric project is currently almost at a standstill. Why is it at a standstill? The reason is very simple: it is only because the facilities of the Tennessee Valley Authority hydroelectric project benefit the people and are not beneficial to the capitalists, so it has stalled. American imperialists constantly persecute scientists with a sense of justice. During the World Peace Petition campaign, the US government also launched a signature campaign against the peace petition against scientists. In California, more than a dozen professors were fired for refusing to sign. Although in such a difficult environment, the progressive forces in the United States are still developing, and the number of peace petitioners is increasing day by day. The democracy that the United States has consistently flaunted is also false. American democracy is limited to democracy among capitalists. When Wallace ran for office before his betrayal, the government restricted him everywhere, scheduling his broadcasts for one or two o'clock in the middle of the night, when no one listened at all. As for the experiences of Chinese students studying abroad, Chinese students in the United States all have American 'advisors.' This 'advisor' is the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Un-American Activities Committee. They can 'call' them to 'investigate' them at any time. Now the Association of Chinese Scientific Workers in the United States has been forced to cease its activities. The American working people are under high pressure from the rulers, and another part of the American people have an unclear understanding due to reactionary propaganda. The work we should be doing now is to enable the American people to understand China through students studying in the United States and various other means. As for Chinese students studying abroad, we must strive for them to return and participate in the construction of the motherland."
　　　　American imperialism is not scary, as the victory of the Chinese people can prove
　　Wang Dazhi of Xiaozhuang School used his experiences in the war to illustrate that American imperialism is not scary. He said: "I agree with the opinions of the two gentlemen above, especially the self-criticism of the scientist just now. This is a conscientious Chinese scientific worker, and I admire this genuine attitude. All of you gentlemen here can do one thing right now, that is, convey the construction situation in China after liberation to the progressive American scientists with whom you have close ties, on the one hand, to let the progressive Americans see a truth in the world, that is, new China is already a new China, and on the other hand, to encourage them to consider their own future.
　　"American imperialism is not scary. According to my personal experience in the Liberation War, at that time we led more than 200 primary school students to evacuate from Central China to Shandong, and then from Shandong to North China. Two years later, we returned from North China to Shandong and then back to Lianghuai, crossing the Yangtze River to Nanjing. Looking back at that time, the Kuomintang occupied such a large area of land, and now only the isolated island of Taiwan is left. When the Liberated Areas were blockaded by the US and Chiang Kai-shek, although the daytime was the world of the US and Chiang Kai-shek, the night was still ours, and we acted the same way. When the New Fourth Army was first reorganized into the Field Army, it had no heavy weapons, but now, with the Kuomintang's delivery, airplanes, tanks, and artillery have all become ours. Not only did we quickly liberate the entire mainland, but our armed forces, apart from the Soviet army, can be regarded as invincible. Judging from this history, there is nothing scary about American imperialism."
　　　　Eliminate pro-American and fear-of-America thoughts and improve people's understanding of American imperialism
　　Chen Jieff of the High School Affiliated to Nanjing University and Tao Zhenqi of the Municipal No. 1 Middle School both said that in the future, educational and scientific workers should make more efforts in ideological education against American aggression, eliminate pro-American and fear-of-America thoughts, and deepen their own and their students' hatred, contempt, and scorn for American imperialism. Chen Jieff said: "American imperialism is invading us and burning the flames of war to our borders, but the China of today is not the China of the past. The vast majority of our people recognize the true face of American imperialism and hate and despise it. However, there are still a small number of people among us who harbor thoughts of fearing and being pro-American. Therefore, we must not only take action to resist American aggression and aid Korea, but also eliminate all thoughts of fearing and being pro-American, educate those who have an unclear understanding not to listen to the 'Voice of America,' which specializes in spreading rumors, and the people of the whole country will unite against the enemy and resist American aggression and aid Korea. Protect our homes and defend our country." Tao Zhenqi said: "We have enough strength to defeat American imperialism's aggression, but what we feel is slightly lacking is that the ideological front is not solid enough today. There are some people who fear the United States, and some who cannot recognize the aggressive nature of American imperialism due to the long-term deception by American imperialists and the reactionary propaganda of the Kuomintang, and who have illusions about it.
　　Today, there are still some people who listen to the 'Voice of America,' and not only do they not feel that this is wrong, but they think it is fashionable. We must criticize this kind of thinking and improve people's understanding of the United States. We intellectuals were anesthetized by colonial education in the past, and our illusions about American imperialism are even more serious. I hope that every scientific and educational worker can examine their own thoughts to see if they have the slightest illusion about American imperialism. If so, they should resolutely abandon it. Only by completely eliminating this kind of thinking can we educate students well, and then conduct propaganda and education to the vast number of citizens through students. We must let the vast number of people realize that today, having illusions or goodwill towards American imperialism is as shameful and sinful as having illusions and goodwill towards Japanese imperialism after the 'September 18th Incident.'"

　　南京教育科学工作者根据在美亲身经历
　  控诉美帝侵略中国罪行
    【本报讯】南京市教育科学界人士于六日下午举行抗美援朝、保家卫国座谈会，到会者有潘菽、李方训、吕烱、陈中凡、陈鹤琴、萧前椿、吴兆苏等一百五十余人。会议中教育科学工作者纷纷就自己亲身经历，揭露与控诉了美帝侵略中国的奸险手段和美国社会的黑暗；并说出了教育科学工作者在反抗美帝侵略的工作中应该努力之点，是肃清亲美、恐美的思想，增强自己和教育学生对美帝的仇视、鄙视及藐视。
            美帝用各种阴险手段，侵略我国。
    科学院的陈遵妫和萧前椿，都以具体例子说出了美帝侵略我国的阴险毒辣手段，陈遵妫说：“美帝运用各种的方法侵略我们。大家都知道美帝在中国曾经运用办教育、科学、宗教等毒辣的方式，借文化的武器侵入我们的心脏。记得以前美帝派驻国民党政府的大使司徒雷登曾在中国办了几十年的燕京大学，现在已经知道他是美帝军部间谍网的首脑之一，他们都不过是借办教育为名来作为一种侵略工具，暗中来进行间谍活动，而使一些人受了蒙蔽还不知道，还认为美帝是好的，因此，使许多人不自觉的产生了亲美的思想。”萧前椿说：“我在美国读书时，美帝曾要我搜集有关东北气候的材料，并帮助马里兰大学编中国矿产图。我当初以为是纯粹学术研究用的，后来才知道美国的一切科学研究机构大部都是军部拿钱，并用于军事，今天美帝侵略火焰烧到东北门口，我对人民祖国犯了罪（语至此，哽咽落泪），我愿在今后工作中赎罪。”
            美国的“民主”“自由”是假的
    说到美国的“民主”“自由”时，金陵大学的许国梁和南京大学的吴兆苏都拿具体例子揭穿了它的虚伪性。许国梁说：“一般人被美国的科学发达所迷惑，以为科学发达就是一切都好，向往美国的所谓‘自由’‘民主’，这一点我们可以以自己亲身的经历来说明：在美国时，我和两位同学想到原子城选读原子能课程，结果因为是中国人而被拒绝。其实美国学者和教授对于我们被拒绝去原子城研究原子能课认为是很可笑的，因为原子能的课程教室距离原子弹工厂是很辽远的，这就说明美国在科学方面并不如我们想像的自由。再由Ｔ·Ｖ·Ａ·的水分为白色人与有色人食用，更可以说明美国并不平等、自由、民主。”吴兆苏接着说：“这里我举出一两点事实来说明美国的实际情况：留美中国科学工作者曾经组织田纳西河水电工程参观团，去实地参观，结果我们在技术上到没有什么收获，可是却由此看出了美帝国主义是怎样地阻碍科学工作。田纳西河水电工程目前几乎陷于停顿状态，为什么会停顿呢？原因很简单，只是由于田纳西河水电工程的设施，有利于人民大众，而无利于资本家，所以就停顿了。美帝不断迫害有正义感的科学家，在保卫世界和平签名运动时，美国政府也向科学家们发动了与和平签名相反对的签名，在加州有十几个教授为了拒绝签名而被解聘。虽然在这样艰苦的环境下，美国的进步力量仍在发展着，和平签名人数日益增加。美国所一贯标榜的民主也是假的，美国的民主只限于资本家之间的民主。华莱士在变节前竞选时政府处处给他限制，替他把广播排在半夜一两点钟，根本没有人听了。说到中国留学生的遭遇，中国学生在美国都有美国的‘顾问’，这个‘顾问’就是联邦调查局，非美活动委员会，他们随时可以把他们‘调’去‘查’问，现在留美中国科学工作者协会已经被迫停止活动了。美国劳动人民是处在统治者的高压之下，另一部分的美国人民则是在反动的宣传下而认识不清，我们现在应做的工作是要通过留美学生及各种方式使美国人民对中国能了解。对中国留学生，我们要争取他们回来参加祖国的建设工作。”
            美帝并不可怕，可拿中国人民胜利来证明
    晓庄学校的汪达之用在战争中的经历，说明美帝不可怕。他说：“我同意上面两位先生的意见，特别是刚刚一位研究科学的先生的自我检讨，这是有良心的中国科学工作者，这种真实的态度使我很敬佩。我们在座的诸位先生当前可以做一件事，即凡是与美国进步人士科学家们有密切联系的，应该把我们中国解放后的建设情况很好传达给他们，一方面可以使美国进步人士看出世界上一个真理，就是新中国已经是新的中国了，另一方面，也可鼓励他们考虑自己的前途。
    “美国不可怕，据我个人在解放战争中的经历，当时我们领着两百多小学生从华中撤退到山东，又从山东撤退到华北，两年之后又从华北回到山东回到两淮，渡江到南京来了。回想当时国民党占有那样大的土地，到现在只剩下台湾一个孤岛了。当解放区被美蒋封锁时，白天虽然是美蒋天下，可是夜间仍是我们的，我们一样的行动。当新四军初改为野战军时，没有重武器，可是现在在国民党的输送下，飞机坦克大炮都变成我们的了。我们不但是很快解放了全大陆，而且我们的武装部队，除了苏军外，要算得无敌的了。由这段历史看来，美帝没有什么可怕的地方。”
            肃清亲美恐美的思想  提高人民对美帝的认识
    南大附中的陈杰夫和市立一中的陶桢祺都说出了今后教育科学工作者应该在反美侵略的思想教育方面多加努力，肃清亲美、恐美思想，加深自己和学生对美帝的仇视，鄙视及藐视。陈杰夫说：“美帝国主义侵略我们，把战争燃烧到我们的边境，但是现在的中国不是过去的中国了，我们绝大部分的人民认清了美帝的真面目，从而仇视他、鄙视他，但是在我们中间还有一小部分人存在着恐美、亲美的思想，因此我们不但要行动起来，抗美援朝，同时要肃清一切恐美、亲美思想，教育一些认识不清的人不再收听专门造谣的‘美国之音’，全国人民同仇敌忾，抗美援朝。保家卫国。”陶桢祺说：“我们有足够的力量打败美帝侵略，但感到稍差的就是今天思想战线不够巩固。有一种人是恐美，一种是由于长期受美帝国主义者的欺骗和国民党的反动宣传，不能认识到美帝的侵略本质，并对其存在幻想。
    今天仍有部分人收听‘美国之音’，不但没有感到这是错误，反而以为时髦，我们必须要批判这种思想，提高人民对美国的认识。我们知识分子过去受殖民地教育的麻醉，对美帝存在的幻想更为严重，希望每个科学教育工作者都能检查一下自己的思想，看看有没有对美帝存在着丝毫幻想，如果有，应坚决抛弃。只有彻底清除这种思想，才能很好地教育学生，再通过学生向广大的市民进行宣传教育，一定要让广大人民都认识到在今天对美帝存在幻想或好感，就同‘九一八’以后对日本帝国主义存在幻想和好感，是一样可耻和罪恶的行为。”
