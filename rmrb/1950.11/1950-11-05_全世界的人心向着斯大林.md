　　The Hearts of People All Over the World Are With Stalin
　　Zhou Libo
　　A famous Soviet director once said that when he met Stalin, the great leader of the world's people, his expression and conversation made him feel as warm as spring. A giant as strong as steel to the enemy, but as warm as spring to the people.
　　The Soviet people love Stalin as they love their kind father.
　　People all over the world also sincerely love Stalin, who defeated fascism, saved world civilization, and is now the standard-bearer of world peace, just like the Soviet people.
　　On the occasion of Stalin's birthday, the Soviet people and the people of all countries expressed their enthusiastic admiration, and they sent all kinds of gifts. Now, birthday gifts from more than forty countries are displayed in the Moscow Gift Museum.
　　On July 28th, Comrade Dan Niang, assistant director of the Gorky Film Studio, accompanied us to visit the Gift Museum. This solid two-story building is the former site of the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts. There are sixteen exhibition rooms upstairs and downstairs. We started from upstairs.
　　Among all the birthday gifts, the most unforgettable is the precious gift from a nine-year-old Czech girl. She made a heart with beautiful cardboard and wrote a letter saying: "Dear Stalin: I give you two hearts, a paper heart and my heart." Her words represent the wishes of all the people who celebrated the birthday. Every country and nation that sent gifts brought the hearts of their people. Chairman Mao brought the hearts of our 475 million people.
　　Among the gifts are various portraits of Stalin, some are embroidered, some are paintings, and some are statues made of sugar, salt, coal, or ivory. A collective farm in Ukraine inlaid a statue of Stalin with cotton and grain. The Stalin statue sent by the Byelorussian Republic was cleverly pieced together with 2,670 leaves, and the children of the orphanage in the same republic inlaid the portrait of the birthday star with 150,000 small pieces of wood. The tapestry sent by Stalin's hometown, the Georgian Republic, wove the young Stalin and also wove Georgian text. In this tapestry, the working class of Stalin's hometown wove their love for Stalin stitch by stitch.
　　The birthday celebration had a broad mass character. The 92,785 Communist Party members in Florence, Italy, sent a telescope. The working people of Romania wrote a thousand congratulatory letters. The population of the Czech Republic is 12 million, and 9 million people signed the congratulatory letters. In this young republic, from Gottwald to children, three-quarters of the people sent congratulations to Stalin. Five million of Bulgaria's seven million people signed congratulatory letters, and the signature books totaled 102 volumes.
　　Workers and peasants in the Soviet Union and other countries used their new achievements to celebrate the birthday. Various factories in Moscow sent various samples. The Stalin Automobile Factory sent the most beautiful car model of the "ZIS" brand. The gift from the Art Glass Factory was the world's largest crystal bottle, 3.5 meters high and weighing 1,200 kilograms, with the portraits of the leaders of the sixteen Soviet republics engraved around it. The birthday gift from the May 1st Factory in Romania was a clock that could indicate the time and calendar. The clock is engraved with the sentence: "Time works for us."
　　"Time works for us" is an inscription that is useful for all workers. We must cherish time and also reduce the waste of labor. The Soviet Union is using various new inventions to reduce heavy physical labor. The gift from the Ural Machine Manufacturing Factory is a model of a new type of crane. This huge machine is automatic. Only four people are needed to manage it when in use, and it can replace the labor of 12,000 people, averaging 3,000 people's work per person. The original arm is 75 meters long, and the container hanging on its mouth can hold 30 tons of soil at a time. It can dig canals and also open coal mines. It takes only 55 seconds to load a carriage of coal with it. There are more than a dozen electric lights on the arm of the crane, so it can also work at night. This new type of crane is not available in other countries besides the Soviet Union.
　　A person's not-so-heavy labor can bear the hard work of 3,000 people. This is the technical foundation for mankind to move towards a communist society. I stood beside it, reluctant to leave for a long time. From the electric lights on the arm of this crane, we saw the bright light of the future communist society.
　　The peasants of collective farms in many places in the Soviet Union took the opportunity of celebrating the birthday to report the results of their year's work. A collective farm called "Millionaire" listed their agricultural and animal husbandry achievements when sending gifts. They paid thousands of tons of cotton and hundreds of tons of grain to the state. In addition, there were 1,200 heads of livestock, 380 tons of dried fruit, and other harvests.
　　Intellectuals and young students also prepared their own unique gifts. A 78-year-old musician from Estonia sent a piano that he made himself, and every small key was made by him personally. People say that the sound of this piano is very accurate and beautiful.
　　The fifth-grade students of the Frunze School in Kyrgyzstan, who are twelve years old, reported their academic achievements as a gift to Stalin. They all received a score of five, which is equivalent to a score of one hundred in our country.
　　The Soviet people are living a happy life today, but they never forget the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for their happiness today. A female guerrilla sent Stalin a gold ring, which was the relic of her close relative who was killed by the German bandits. The female sculptor Rakichina sent Stalin a statue of a resolute young girl, which is the posthumous image of Danya, a household name in the Soviet Union who was unyielding and generously sacrificed in the hands of the German bandits.
　　The Soviet Union and our country are carrying out great construction, but there are still reactionaries in the world, namely the American imperialists and their running dogs, who are shamelessly and frantically slaughtering the common people in Korea. Many soldiers have sacrificed for the liberation of their own nation. The Communist Parties in imperialist countries have been fighting hard against the enemy underground in the past and present, and many comrades have generously sacrificed themselves. In order to commemorate them forever, the Communist Parties of various countries sent some relics of the martyrs. The wife of the leader of the German Communist Party, Thalmann, sent Thalmann's photo. Everyone knows that Thalmann was imprisoned in a concentration camp by Hitler and later killed. The Communist Party of Milan, Italy, also sent a photo of the leader of a guerrilla team who sacrificed himself in the resistance against Hitler. Piyanki, who was imprisoned by the demon Hitler, sacrificed himself in the prison where he was held for eleven years, and his comrades sent the handcuffs that locked him.
　　In the resistance movement, 75,000 members of the French Communist Party gloriously dedicated their lives. The editor of "L'Humanité", Peri, was murdered by Hitler. In addition, there are many male and female heroes who died at the hands of the demon Hitler. The French Communist Party has not forgotten them. During the birthday celebration, the French Communist Party sent the relics of the outstanding sons of their people as the most sacred gift. The Montvalia Prison in France is the place where the most communists were killed. The French Communist Party dug up a piece of soil from the execution ground that was sprinkled with the blood of countless martyrs, put it in a wooden box, attached a photo of Montvalia, and dedicated it to Stalin. The Paris Aviation Department transported a piece of wall soil from the torture chamber of the Paris secret police, and the wall soil still had the bloody handprints of the communists.
　　This is a sacred gift. This piece of soil and wall soil has given us a profound education in revolutionary integrity, and at the same time aroused our hatred for the enemy and our remembrance of the martyrs.
　　When people all over the world celebrate the birthday of the great successor of Lenin's teachings, people also think of the people who first illuminated the path of human progress with the brilliance of scientific communism: Marx, Engels, and Lenin. The Communist Parties of various countries sent some precious relics of Marx and Lenin. The German Communist Party sent a book "The Living Conditions of Russian Workers", which was the work of a Russian writer in 1870. There were densely written notes by Marx on the book, which shows Marx's carefulness when reading it, and also shows how deeply he cared about the lives of the working class in various countries. The Gift Museum carefully placed this commemorative book on a red silk base and put it in a glass frame to prevent it from being contaminated with a little dust. The Central Committee of the French Communist Party sent the porcelain used by Marx's daughter, Lau Lafargue, that her father used. Marx and his wife may have used this porcelain teapot to entertain his best comrade-in-arms, Engels. The Central Committee of the Belgian Communist Party sent a personal letter from Marx to his comrades in Belgium, which has never been published. The Italian Communist Party sent the works of Marx translated by the leader of the Italian Communist Party, Togliatti. The Central Committee of the French Communist Party also sent a hat worn by Lenin in Renzo Monte in 1911. The Soviet Foreign Language Publishing Bureau sent translations of Stalin's works in various languages of the world.
　　Looking at these exhibits, it really makes people feel that this is a world revolution museum, and at the same time a world customs museum. The gifts sent by various countries and nations all have a strong national color. A portrait of Stalin sent by Moldova has the characteristics of the Moldovan people's appearance. This artist loves his own people and also loves Stalin. He combines his two loves in a portrait. The gifts sent by the Mongolian People's Republic are some models that show the life of the Mongolian people. The contrast between the new and the old in these models is the strongest. Next to the camel is a new-style car, and a new-style electric stove and radio are installed in the yurt. A huge tapestry sent by Azerbaijan has 70 square meters. It was woven day and night by 70 weavers in eight months. The tapestry depicts Stalin in the Kremlin, surrounded by the sixteen republics and the places where Stalin carried out revolutionary activities. The prominent places on the tapestry depict the portraits of Lenin and his comrades-in-arms, and another prominent place on the tapestry depicts the scenery of Azerbaijan. The Democratic Republic of Germany sent a model of an astronomical observatory. German technicians are preparing to build a new-style astronomical observatory in Stalingrad, and the parts and funds will be provided by the government of the Democratic Republic of Germany. Everything sent by the Italian people shows that their country has everything and does not need the Marshall Plan. The leader of the French Communist Party, Thorez, wrote on the birthday banner: "The French people will never oppose the Soviet Union." This simple sentence represents the true feelings of thousands of French people who love justice. Among the many gifts sent by Bulgaria, one is rose oil, which is a valuable specialty of Bulgaria. Four tons of roses can only refine one kilogram of oil, and the roses planted on one hectare of land can only grow 700 cubic centimeters of oil. The Bulgarian people have passed down the story that people who smell the fragrance of this rose oil will have boundless happiness and longevity. They packed two wooden bottles of oil and sent them to Stalin in order to wish him more happiness and longevity. Among the gifts from Kazakhstan is the poem of their famous poet Jambyl. The Ministry of Defense of Hungary presented a statue of Petőfi. Petőfi was a Hungarian patriotic poet who sacrificed himself in the revolutionary era of 1848. Lu Xun and the poet Yin Fu, who was killed by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, were both enthusiastic about his poems. Poems and poets are as valuable as rose oil in life. It is a great pride for a nation to have a revolutionary poet like Petőfi. Using poems and statues of poets as birthday gifts is a grand birthday gift.
　　We finished walking upstairs and came downstairs again. When we walked into the Chinese room, everyone was very excited. The room was full of colorful birthday banners, birthday immortals, embroidered portraits, porcelain statues, jade cranes, nine-dragon steles, eight immortals crossing the sea, Huang Shangu's collection of poems, Qi Baishi's "Longevity Peach", and a Chinese painting of Stalin standing under a pine tree. All of this fully carries the characteristics of Chinese national art. What is particularly eye-catching is the ivory bottle sent by Chairman Mao. The bottle is engraved with pavilions, terraces, and towers, as well as a hundred characters from novels. This is an extremely delicate work of art that took nine years to carve. The birthday banner presented by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has the following eight characters inscribed by Chairman Mao: "May your happiness be as immense as the Eastern Sea, and your lifespan as long as the Southern Mountain."
　　This completely Chinese-style congratulatory message is most suitable to send to Stalin. People who have made contributions like mountains to mankind should be as eternal as mountains.
　　The Soviet comrade who explained to us said: "The Chinese room is the most popular room." This is because liberated China is a model for the emancipation of oppressed nations all over the world. Under the genius leadership of Chairman Mao, we have become a heroic nation that is especially respected by the people of the world. People want to see Chinese things, see Chairman Mao's gifts and inscriptions. The Soviet people are full of love for Chairman Mao.
　　Leaving the Gift Museum, everyone was full of faith. We have seen that the hearts of people all over the world are with Stalin, which means that the friends of the democratic and peaceful camp with Stalin as the standard-bearer are all over the world. If the despicable American war-mongers want to provoke a war, their heads will be smashed on this huge and strong wall of peace.

　　全世界的人心向着斯大林
    周立波
    苏联的一位名导演曾经说，当他见到斯大林的时候，这位世界人民的伟大领袖的神情和谈话，使他感到春天一样的温暖。对敌人好象钢铁一样坚强的巨人，对人民却象春天一样的温暖。
    苏联人民敬爱斯大林，好象敬爱自己的慈祥的父亲一样。
    全世界人民也和苏联人民一样衷心的敬爱打败了法西斯，拯救了世界文明，现在又是世界和平的旗手的斯大林。
    苏联人民和世界各国的人民，在斯大林寿辰之际，都表示了他们敬仰的热忱，他们送来了各色各样的礼物。现在，已经有四十多个国家的寿礼陈列在莫斯科的礼物馆里。
    七月二十八日，高尔基电影制片厂的助理导演丹娘同志陪着我们去看礼物馆。这座坚固的两层楼房，是普希金造型艺术博物馆的旧址。楼上和楼下，一共有十六个陈列室。我们从楼上看起。
    一切寿礼中，使人难以忘记的是捷克一个九岁女孩子的珍贵的献礼。她用漂亮的硬纸作了一颗心，写封信来说：“亲爱的斯大林：我送给你两颗心，一颗纸的心，一颗我的心。”她的话代表了所有祝寿的人们的心意，每一个送礼的国家和民族，都是带了自己的人民的心去的。毛主席是带了我们四亿七千五百万人民的心去的。
    礼物中有斯大林的各式各样的肖像，有的是刺绣，有的是绘画，有的是用糖块、盐巴、石炭或象牙制作的雕像。乌克兰一个集体农场，用棉花和谷物镶制了一个斯大林的像。白俄罗斯共和国送来的斯大林像，是用二千六百七十片树叶巧妙的拼成，这同一共和国的孤儿院的孩子们用十五万颗小木头镶了寿翁的肖像。斯大林的故乡格鲁吉亚共和国送来的墙毯，织了青年时代的斯大林，也织了格鲁吉亚文。在这张墙毯里，斯大林的故乡的工人阶级，一针一线织进了他们对于斯大林的敬爱。
    祝寿带着广大的群众性。意大利弗罗连斯的九万二千七百八十五个共产党员送来一架望远镜。罗马尼亚的劳动人民写来了一千封贺信。捷克人口共有一千二百万，有九百万人在贺信上签名，在这个年青的共和国里，从哥特瓦尔德到小孩子，有四分之三的人向斯大林致贺。保加利亚七百万人口中有五百万在祝寿信上签名，签名册子共有一百○二卷。
    苏联和各国的工人和农民，用了自己的新的成就来祝贺寿辰。莫斯科各个工厂送来了各种各样的样品。斯大林汽车厂送来了最漂亮的汽车“齐斯”牌的模型。艺术玻璃厂的礼物是一只世界上最大的水晶瓶，高三公尺半，重一千二百公斤，周围刻镂着苏联十六个共和国的领袖像。罗马尼亚五一工厂的寿礼是一座时钟，它能表明时间和日历。钟上刻着一句话：“时间为我们工作。”
    “时间为我们工作”，这是一句对于一切工作者都有用处的铭语。我们要珍惜时间，也要减少劳力的浪费。苏联正在用各种各样的新发明，来减轻繁重的体力的劳动。乌拉尔的机器制造厂的礼物是一种新式起重机的模型。这种庞大的机械是自动的。使用的时候只要四个人管理，它能代替一万二千人劳动，平均每人可作三千人的事。原物臂长七十五公尺，嘴上吊的盛物器，一次可装三十吨泥土，它能挖运河，也能开煤矿。用它装车，装好一车厢煤炭，只要五十五秒钟。起重机的臂上有十几盏电灯，晚上也可以工作。这种新式的起重机，除苏联外，其他国家都没有。
    一个人的并不繁重的劳动，可以担负三千人的辛苦的工作。这就是使人类迈向共产主义社会的技术的基础。我站在它的旁边，久久不想离开。从这一架起重机的臂上的电灯里，我们看见了未来的共产主义社会的灿烂的光芒。
    苏联许多地方的集体农场的农民，趁着祝寿的机会，报告了自己的一年劳作的成果。一个名叫“百万富翁”的集体农场，送礼时开列了他们的农作畜牧的成就，他们向国家缴纳了成千吨棉花，成百吨谷物。此外还有家畜一千二百头，干水果三百八十吨，和其他的收获。
    知识分子和青年学生也备办了自己的别致的礼品。爱沙尼亚一位七十八岁的音乐家送来的一架钢琴，是他自己制造的，每一个小键都是他亲手制作。人们都说，这架钢琴的音是非常准确而且优美的。
    吉尔吉斯的伏龙兹学校五年级的十二岁学生报告了他们的学业成绩，作为对斯大林的献礼，他们每个人都获得了五分，相当于我国一百分的成绩。
    苏联人民今天过着幸福的日子，却从不忘记为了他们今天的幸福而牺牲了生命的烈士。一个女游击队员，送给斯大林一只金戒指，这是被德寇杀死的她交亲的遗物。女雕刻家拉基奇娜送给斯大林一个刚毅的少女的雕像，这就是在德寇手里坚贞不屈，慷慨牺牲的苏联家喻户晓的丹娘的遗像。
    苏联和我国，正在进行伟大的建设，但是，世界上还有反动派，这就是美国帝国主义者和他的走狗，他们正在朝鲜卑劣的，疯狂的屠杀老百姓。许多战士为了自己民族的解放牺牲了。帝国主义国家的共产党，过去和现在，都在地下艰苦的和敌人斗争，许多同志慷慨殉节了。为了永远纪念他们，各国共产党送来了一些烈士的遗物。德国共产党领袖台尔曼的夫人送来了台尔曼的遗照。大家都知道，台尔曼是被希特勒关在集中营里，后来又被杀死了的。意大利米兰的共产党也送来了反抗希特勒而牺牲了的一个游击队的领袖的遗照。被希魔囚禁的皮洋基，牺牲在关了他十一年的监牢里，他的战友把锁他的那付手铐送来了。
    在抵抗运动中，法国共产党有七万五千党员光荣献身了。《人道报》的编辑培利，被希特勒谋杀了。此外还有许多死于希魔之手的男女英雄，法国共产党都没有忘记他们，在祝寿时，法共把自己人民的优秀儿子们的遗物当做最圣洁的献礼送来了。法国的蒙瓦利亚监狱是杀害共产党人最多的地方。法共把那刑场上洒了无数先烈的热血的一块土，挖来放在木匣里，附了一张蒙瓦利亚的照片，献与斯大林。巴黎航空部运来巴黎秘密警察所的刑室的一片墙土，那墙土上面还留着共产党人的带血的手印。
    这是神圣的献礼。这块泥土和墙土，使得我们受到深刻的革命气节教育，同时也激起我们对敌人的仇恨，和对先烈的追怀。
    在全世界人民庆祝列宁遗教的伟大继承者的生日的时候，人们也想起了最初用科学的共产主义的光辉照耀着人类前进道路的人们：马克思，恩格斯和列宁。各国共产党送来了马克思和列宁的一些珍贵的遗物。德国共产党送来一本《俄国工人生活情况》，这是一八七○年一位俄罗斯作家的著作。书上有马克思手写的密密麻麻的批语，可见马克思读它的时候的细心，也可见他是如何深切地关怀各国工人阶级的生活。礼物馆把这一本可纪念的书籍用红绸子垫底，小心的装在玻璃框子里，不使它蒙受一点点灰尘。法国共产党中央送来了马克思的女儿拉乌·拉发格保存的她父亲用过的瓷器。马克思和他的夫人也许曾用这把瓷器茶壶款待过他的最好的战友恩格斯的吧。比利时共产党中央送来了马克思给比利时的战友的一封亲笔信，这封信从来没有发表过。意大利共产党送来了意共领袖托里亚蒂翻译的马克思的著作。法共中央还送来了列宁一九一一年在伦佐木戴过的一顶帽子。苏联外国文书籍出版局，送来了斯大林著作的世界各国的译本。
    看了这些陈列物，真使人觉得这是一个世界革命博物馆，同时也是一个世界风土博物馆。各个国家，各个民族送来的礼物，都带着浓厚的自己民族的色彩。摩尔达维亚送的一帧斯大林像，带着摩尔达维亚人的容貌的特点，这位艺术家爱自己的人民，也爱斯大林，他把他的两种爱，在一帧肖像里结合起来了。蒙古人民共和国所送的礼物是一些表现蒙古民族生活的模型，这些模型，新与旧的对照最强烈，骆驼的旁边，摆着新式的汽车，蒙古包里，按了新式的电炉和收音机。亚塞尔拜疆送的一张巨大的墙毯，有七十方公尺，它是由七十名织工，用八个月工夫日夜赶织成功的。墙毯上织出了斯大林在克里姆林宫，围绕在四周的是十六个共和国和斯大林进行革命活动的地方。毯子的显著的地方，绘织了列宁和他的战友的肖像，毯子另外一个显著的地方，绘织了亚塞尔拜疆的风景。民主德国送来一个天文台的模型，德国技师准备在斯大林格勒修造一座新式天文台，零件和经费都由民主德国的政府来供给。意大利人民送来的每一样东西，都说明着自己的国家样样有，用不着什么马歇尔计划。法国共产党领袖多列士在寿幛上写道：“法国人决不反苏。”这句简单的话代表了千千万万爱好正义的法国人的真实的情感。保加利亚送的许多礼物中，有一样是玫瑰花油，这是保加利亚的名贵的特产，四吨玫瑰花，只能炼一公斤油，栽种在一公顷土地上的玫瑰花，只能生长七百公分油。保加利亚的老百姓相传，嗅了这种玫瑰花油的香气的人会福寿无疆，他们装了两木瓶子油送给斯大林，为的是祝他多福又多寿。卡查赫的礼物中，有他们的著名诗人江布尔的诗。匈牙利的保卫部赠送一尊彼得裴的雕像。彼得裴是在一八四八年革命的年代里牺牲的匈牙利的爱国诗人。鲁迅和被蒋介石匪帮杀害的诗人殷夫，都曾热中他的诗。诗和诗人在人生里像玖瑰花油似的贵重。一个民族有彼得裴这样的革命诗人是一种莫大的骄傲。用诗和诗人的雕像来作为寿礼是一种隆重的寿礼。
    我们走完了楼上，又来到楼下。当我们走进中国室的时候，大家都非常的兴奋。这里满室满壁都是彩色缤纷的寿幛、寿仙、绣像、瓷像、翠玉鹤、九龙碑、八仙飘海、黄山谷的诗集、齐白石的“寿桃”、松树之下站着斯大林的国画，这一切都充分的带着中国民族艺术的特点，特别引人注目的是毛主席送的象牙瓶，瓶上刻镂了亭台楼阁，还刻了一百个小说里的人物，这是花了九年工夫雕刻的一件极其精巧的艺术品。中共中央致送的寿幛，毛主席题着下面八个字：“福如东海，寿比南山”。
    这句完全中国气派的祝词，送给斯大林，是最适合的了，对人类有着山岳一样的贡献的人应该象山岳一样的永在。
    为我们讲解的苏联同志说：“中国室是最受欢迎的一室。”这是因为解放了的中国是全世界被压迫民族翻身的榜样。在毛主席天才领导之下，我们成了全世界的人们特别敬重的英雄民族了。人们都要看看中国的东西，看看毛主席的礼物和题字。苏联人民对于毛主席充满了热爱。
    从礼物馆出来，大家满怀信念。我们看到了全世界的人心向着斯大林，这就是说：以斯大林为旗手的民主和平的阵营的朋友遍布全世界，卑劣的美国战争贩子们如果要挑动战争的话，他们的头颅会在这个巨大而又坚强的和平壁垒之上碰得粉碎的。
            一九五○年十月，北京。
