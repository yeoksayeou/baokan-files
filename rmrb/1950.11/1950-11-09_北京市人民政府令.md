　　Provisional Regulations on Private Housing Rental in Beijing

　　I. General Provisions

　　Article 1: These regulations are formulated to implement the policy of protecting private property and to adjust housing rental relationships in this city. Unless otherwise stipulated by laws and regulations or customary law, both landlords and tenants shall abide by the provisions of these regulations.

　　II. Lease Agreements

　　Article 2: All matters related to housing rental shall be agreed upon by both landlords and tenants and must be stipulated in writing. If no written agreement has been made, it must be supplemented (or replaced with a rent booklet).

　　Article 3: If the lease has a fixed term, and the ownership is transferred within the term, the rights and obligations of the original landlord to the tenant in the original lease agreement shall be borne by the new owner.

　　Article 4: Tenants shall not sublet or sub-assign the house without the consent of the landlord. If the tenant has already sublet or sub-assigned the house before the implementation of these regulations, the current user must immediately enter into a lease agreement directly with the landlord. If there are disputes, they shall be settled separately.

　　III. Rent

　　Article 5: The rent amount shall be determined freely by both landlords and tenants based on the principles of fairness and reasonableness, and calculated and paid in Renminbi or in kind.

　　Article 6: The landlord may collect a one-month rent deposit when renting the house. It is permissible if the deposit exceeds one month and both landlords and tenants agree. However, the deposit shall be regarded as a prepayment of rent. In addition, the landlord shall not collect any other fees from the tenant under any name. However, fees already collected before the implementation of these regulations shall be subject to their agreements.

　　Article 7: If either the landlord or the tenant disagrees with the rent amount, they may request an increase or decrease. However, before the new rent amount is agreed upon, the rent shall still be paid according to the original agreement, and no arrears or refusal to accept payment shall be allowed.

　　IV. Recovery of Housing

　　Article 8: Under one of the following circumstances, the landlord may recover the house: 1. When the landlord needs it for their own use; 2. When the landlord sells the house; 3. When the house is to be rebuilt; 4. When the tenant is in arrears with rent for three months; 5. When the tenant sublets or sub-assigns the house without authorization. If the lease has a fixed term, the landlord shall not recover the house according to the provisions of items 1 and 2 within the term.

　　Article 9: The landlord shall notify the tenant in advance when recovering the house. The deadline for handing over the house shall not exceed three months at most. However, under one of the circumstances in items 4 and 5 of the preceding article, the house shall be handed over immediately. No delaying tactics shall be allowed.

　　Article 10: If it is necessary to start construction quickly due to rebuilding and recovering the house, the deadline for handing over the house may be shortened through mutual agreement.

　　Article 11: When the landlord recovers the house, the tenant shall not demand "moving expenses." If the tenant is indeed unable to move, they may request appropriate subsidies from the landlord for the actual expenses required for relocation, but the maximum shall not exceed three months' original rent.

　　Article 12: For rent owed by the tenant before the implementation of these regulations, both parties shall immediately negotiate a repayment method. If the tenant makes up the payment, the landlord shall not use this as a reason to recover the house.

　　Article 13: If the landlord rents the house recovered for their own use to another person within half a year, the original tenant may request compensation for the losses suffered due to the relocation, except for special circumstances approved by the government.

　　V. Repairs

　　Article 14: Unless otherwise agreed, the landlord shall be responsible for repairing the house. If the landlord fails to repair when repairs are due, the tenant shall notify the landlord to repair it within a fixed period. If the landlord refuses to repair, the tenant may request the local district public office to certify and repair it themselves, and the expenses shall be deducted from the rent on a monthly basis.

　　Article 15: If the tenant needs to demolish, alter, or renovate the house for their own needs, they shall obtain the landlord's consent in advance and negotiate the handling method at the time of vacating the house, and record it in the lease agreement.

　　Article 16: If the tenant or a third party suffers damages due to the landlord's failure to repair the house, the landlord shall be liable for compensation.

　　Article 17: The tenant is responsible for protecting the house. If the tenant damages the house, they shall be liable for compensation.

　　VI. Supplementary Provisions

　　Article 18: Real estate tax shall be borne by the landlord, but if the parties have otherwise agreed, their agreement shall prevail.

　　Article 19: These regulations shall come into effect on the date of promulgation; if there are any unfulfilled matters, they may be amended at any time.
