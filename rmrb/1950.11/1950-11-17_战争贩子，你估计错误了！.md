　　War Peddlers, Your Calculations are Wrong!
　　Professor Wen Jiasi, Peking University

　　The Chinese people love peace, but they are not afraid of war. When there is no war, they devote themselves to construction. Once war breaks out, they will immediately arm themselves and engage in heroic battles to defend their motherland. The eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year War of Liberation are the most concrete manifestations of this spirit. At the same time, the Chinese people have gained more experience in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year War of Liberation, making them more deeply understand that before imperialism is completely eliminated, the desire for peace and the will to fight are inseparable. That is to say, only by taking active actions to resist aggression and stop atrocities can peace be ensured, and a people who truly love peace must not be afraid of war.

　　The American imperialists, blinded by money, think that the Chinese people's love of peace is a sign of weakness. The Chinese people need a stable environment to engage in construction, which was originally the right of the Chinese people, but they insist on thinking that this is a great opportunity for the imperialists to carry out aggression to save themselves from extinction. As for the fact that the Chinese people once defeated a powerful enemy in the eight-year War of Resistance and the three-year War of Liberation, the American imperialists seem to not understand what forces this powerful enemy relied on to be defeated. Therefore, they dare to expand the war of aggression against Korea, surging toward the border of our Northeast; they dare to bomb our cities, massacre our people, and shell our merchant ships; they dare to follow in the footsteps of Japanese fascists,妄想(wàngxiǎng - vainly attempt) to occupy Taiwan, destroy Manchuria and Mongolia, and conquer all of China. However, the Chinese people love peace but are not afraid of war. This is why our volunteer forces suddenly appeared on the Korean battlefield at the very moment when the enemy was clamoring and acting most vigorously.

　　战争贩子，你估计错误了！
    北大教授  闻家驷
    中国人民是爱好和平的，但也不害怕战争；在没有战争的时候，他埋头从事于建设，一旦战争爆发了，他会立刻把自己武装起来，为了保卫祖国而进行英勇的战斗，八年的抗日战争和三年的解放战争便是这样一种精神的一个最具体的表现。同时中国人民在八年的抗日战争和三年的解放战争当中也获得更多的经验，使他更加深切地了解在帝国主义尚未彻底消灭以前，和平的愿望和战斗的意志是不可分割的，这就是说，只有采取积极的行动来抵抗侵略，制止暴行，才能确保和平，而一个真正爱好和平的人民，必须不害怕战争。
    美帝国主义者，被金钱冲昏了头脑，他以为中国人民爱好和平是一种软弱的表示；中国人民需要一个安定的环境来从事建设，原是中国人民应有的权利，他偏要以为这是帝国主义者肆行侵略以挽救其自身的灭亡的大好时机。至于中国人民曾经在八年抗战和三年的解放战争当中打垮了一个强大的敌人，这个强大的敌人是依靠什么力量才把他打垮的，美帝国主义者似乎并不了解；因此它才敢于扩大侵朝战争，向我国东北的边境汹涌进逼，他才敢于轰炸我国的城市，屠杀我国的人民，炮击我国的商船，他才敢于继日本法西斯之后，妄想侵占台湾，灭亡满蒙，征服全中国。然而中国人民爱好和平但也不怕战争。这便是为什么正当敌人叫嚣和行动得最起劲的时候，我们的志愿部队忽然在朝鲜的战场上面出现了。
    战争贩子，你估计错误了！
