    [This newspaper reports] The Beijing business community in various industries has launched a comfort campaign for the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and has formulated specific comfort measures. The preface of the measures pointed out: When the heinous American imperialists invaded Korea and ignited the flames of war towards our border, we Chinese people can no longer sit idly by. Now, the brothers who are participating in the Volunteer Army to Aid Korea have crossed the Yalu River and are bravely shouldering the task of defending the border of the motherland in the severe cold of minus twenty degrees at 42 degrees north latitude, and under the command of the General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army, they are fighting side by side with the Korean troops like brothers to annihilate the enemy. In the short period since the start of the battle, they have achieved brilliant victories, which is the glory of the Chinese people. This kind of action for justice is worthy of our admiration and learning. The Beijing business community is determined to enthusiastically support and assist with practical actions, and launch a comfort campaign to express our enthusiasm for support and to pay our highest respect to the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Aid Korea.
    The specific actions for the comfort campaign are divided into two types: letters of sympathy and comfort items.
    The methods for launching the writing of letters of sympathy and collecting comfort items are specifically stipulated as follows: they should be launched in a planned manner by the committees of various industries to defend world peace and oppose American aggression; comfort items from each business should be centrally collected by the committees of each industry; each industry should complete the collection of comfort items from all businesses within one week from the date of launch, and each household should write one letter of sympathy as a principle, which does not need to be sealed; the content of the comfort items should be vests, handkerchiefs, gloves, socks, etc.
