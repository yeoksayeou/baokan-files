Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, November 23rd: The Second World Peace Congress's appeal to the United Nations Organization is as follows:

　　When the people of the world established the United Nations, they placed great hopes on it, the greatest of which was the hope for peace.

　　But today, war has destroyed the peaceful lives of people in some countries, and tomorrow it will destroy the peaceful lives of all mankind. If the United Nations fails to live up to the primary hope placed in it by the people of the world—whether represented in the United Nations by their governments or not yet represented—if the United Nations does not give mankind a guarantee of tranquility and peace, it is because the United Nations has been influenced by a force that ignores the only possible path to world peace: seeking universal agreement.

　　If the United Nations is to live up to the hopes that humanity still places in it, then it must return to the path that the people pointed out to it from the day it was born; it must guarantee the prompt convening of a meeting of the five major powers—the Soviet Union, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and the People's Republic of China—to discuss and peacefully resolve current differences as the first step along this path.

　　The Second World Peace Congress, including representatives from eighty countries and representing the true voice of peace-loving humanity, firmly demands that the United Nations and the legislative bodies to which governments are responsible immediately consider the following proposals, which aim to restore and maintain peace, and restore and maintain trust between all countries—regardless of their social systems.

　　(1) The current war in Korea not only brings incalculable disasters to the Korean people but also threatens to develop into a new world war; in view of this fact, we feel uneasy and firmly advocate ending this war, withdrawing foreign troops from Korea, and peacefully resolving the civil war between the two parts of Korea with the participation of representatives of the Korean people. We firmly advocate that this issue should be resolved by a fully constituted Security Council including representatives of the People's Republic of China. We call for an end to the intervention of American troops in China's Taiwan (Formosa) and the war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which is also fraught with the threat of world war.

　　(2) We firmly condemn all attempts and measures that violate international agreements prohibiting the re-militarization of Germany and Japan. These attempts and measures are a serious threat to the cause of peace. We firmly demand the conclusion of peace treaties with a unified, demilitarized Germany and Japan, and the withdrawal of occupying forces from these two countries.

　　(3) We believe that attempts to forcibly subjugate some nations and subject them to colonial oppression are a threat to the cause of peace, and we declare that these nations should have the right to freedom and independence. We loudly denounce all forms of racial discrimination, as they create hatred between nations and are a threat to peace.

　　(4) We believe it is necessary to expose the attempts of aggressors to confuse the concept of aggression in order to justify foreign interference in the internal affairs of other countries. No political, strategic, or economic considerations, no reasons concerning the domestic situation or domestic conflicts of a country, can serve as a basis for any country to interfere militarily in the internal affairs of another country. Regardless of the pretext, the criminal act committed by the country that first uses military force against another country is aggression.

　　(5) We believe that the propaganda of new wars poses the greatest threat to the peaceful cooperation of all nations and is one of the most cruel crimes against humanity. We call on the parliaments of all countries to pass laws guaranteeing peace, stipulating that any form of propaganda for new wars should be criminally liable.

　　(6) All upright people, regardless of their political beliefs, unanimously believe that the cruel and merciless mass extermination of civilians is a crime against all mankind. We demand that an international authoritative commission investigate the crimes committed in Korea, and it should be made clear that the responsibility of General MacArthur be investigated.

　　(7) We eagerly hope to ensure a solid and lasting peace for all mankind, and we hereby submit the following recommendations for consideration by the United Nations, national parliaments, and the people of all countries. These recommendations express the vital needs of the people who bear the heavy burden of military budgets.

　　Unconditional prohibition of all atomic weapons, bacteriological and chemical weapons, poison gas, radioactive weapons, and other instruments of mass human destruction; declare the government that first uses these weapons to be a war criminal.

　　The Second World Peace Congress, recognizing its responsibility to the people of all countries, issues a solemn appeal to the major powers and recommends that they simultaneously and gradually reduce all armies—land, air, and naval forces—by one-third to one-half proportionally between 1951 and 1952.

　　This measure will decisively limit the arms race, reduce the danger of aggression, and help alleviate the heavy national military budgets that weigh on all strata of people. It will also promote the restoration of international mutual trust and the necessary coordination between countries (regardless of their systems).

　　The Congress declares that the control of the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass human destruction, as well as the control of conventional armaments and disarmament, is technically feasible. An international control agency with authoritative supervisory powers should be established under the Security Council. The function of this agency should be to implement controls to supervise the reduction of armaments and to supervise the prohibition of atomic, bacteriological, chemical, and other weapons of mass destruction. In order to be effective, this control should apply not only to the military, to the existing armaments and arms production that have been declared by each country, but also, at the request of the International Control Commission, should supervise the planned military and the existing armaments and arms production that have not been declared.

　　These proposals to reduce armies are the first stage of universal and thorough disarmament, which is the ultimate goal of peace fighters.

　　The Second World Peace Congress affirms that the pursuit of balance through the arms race cannot guarantee peace. The Congress firmly believes that the measures it proposes will not give any advantage to either side militarily, and will undoubtedly avoid war, guarantee security, and improve the welfare of the people of all countries in the world.

　　We ask everyone to pay attention to the fact that certain countries are moving towards a war economy, which is increasingly deviating international economic relations and the exchange of raw materials and finished products from the right track, causing the living standards of the people of many countries to suffer tragically, hindering economic progress and serious cooperation between countries, and in the long run will become a source of conflict—a threat to the cause of peace. Starting from the vital interests of the people of all countries and striving to improve the international situation, we recommend restoring normal trade relations between countries on the basis of mutual benefit to meet the needs of the people, eliminating any form of discrimination, to ensure the development of national economies and the economic development of large and small countries.

　　(8) We believe that destroying cultural relations between the people of all countries will create discord, lose mutual understanding, create distrust, and promote war propaganda. At the same time, we believe that strengthening cultural relations between all peoples will create conditions of mutual understanding and trust in the common struggle for peace. Therefore, we call on the governments of all countries to promote the improvement of cultural relations between the people of all countries and to promote the mutual study of the cultural treasures of all countries. We recommend promoting the organization of international conferences of cultural leaders, mutual visits to their countries, large-scale publication of literary books of the people of other countries, and familiarity with their art.

　　(9) We ask the United Nations not to fail the expectations of the people of all countries, and we ask the United Nations to pay attention to the World Peace Council that we have established, which is a fully representative body including representatives of the people of all countries, including representatives of United Nations member states, as well as representatives of non-United Nations members, and also including representatives of the people of those countries that are still dependent and colonial countries.

　　The World Peace Council calls on the United Nations to take practical actions to fulfill its responsibility to strengthen and develop international peace cooperation. The World Peace Council shoulders the lofty task of conforming to the vital interests of the people of all countries and ensuring solid and lasting peace. The World Peace Council will convince all mankind that, despite the difficulties that cannot be underestimated at present, it will surely accomplish its mission.

### 世界和大致联合国组织呼吁书

　　世界和大致联合国组织呼吁书
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社华沙二十三日讯：第二届世界保卫和平大会致联合国组织呼吁书如下：
    全世界人民在缔造联合国时，曾对它寄予很大的希望，其中最大的一个就是对和平的希望。
    但在今天，战争已摧毁了一些国家的人民的和平生活，而在明日势将摧毁整个人类的和平生活。如果联合国辜负全世界人民——不论是由他们的政府代表参加了联合国的或是还没有代表参加的——寄托在它身上的主要希望，如果联合国不给人类以安静与和平的保证，那就是因为联合国已受到某种势力的影响，这种势力忽视走向全世界和平的唯一可能的道路——寻求普遍的协议。
    如果联合国要不辜负人类仍然寄托在它身上的希望，那末它必须回到从它诞生的一天起人民给它指出的道路上去；它必须保证尽速召开五大国——苏联、美国、法国、英国、中华人民共和国——会议，来讨论与和平解决目前的意见分歧，以此作为沿着这条道路前进的第一步。
    包括八十个国家的代表和代表着爱好和平的人类的真正的声音的第二届世界保卫和平大会，坚决要求联合国以及各国政府对之负责的各立法机关，立即考虑下列的建议，这些建议的目的在于恢复与维持和平，恢复与维持一切国家——不论它们的社会制度如何——之间的信任。
    （一）目前在朝鲜进行着的战争，不但给朝鲜人民带来了无法估计的灾难，而且势将发展成为新的世界大战；鉴于这种事实，我们心感不安，我们坚决主张结束这场战争，自朝鲜撤退外国军队，并在朝鲜人民代表参加之下，和平解决朝鲜两部分地区之间的内战。我们坚决主张这个问题应由包括中华人民共和国代表在内的、组织完全的安全理事会来加以解决。我们呼吁制止美国军队对中国的台湾（福摩萨）的干涉，以及对越南民主共和国进行的战争，这个战争也充满着世界战争的威胁。
    （二）我们坚决斥责一切违反禁止德国和日本的重新军事化的国际协定的企图与措施。这些企图与措施都是对和平事业的严重威胁。我们坚决要求与统一的、非军事化的德国和日本缔结和约，并从该两国撤退占领军。
    （三）我们认为用强力使一些民族处于从属地位和遭受殖民地压迫的企图，是对和平事业的威胁，我们宣布这些民族应有自由和独立的权利。我们大声疾呼反对一切形式的种族歧视，因为它们造成民族之间的仇恨，而且是对和平的威胁。
    （四）我们认为有必要来揭露侵略者的企图，他们想混淆侵略的概念，借以为外国干涉他国内政取得口实。任何政治、战略和经济上的考虑，任何关于某一国家的国内局势或国内冲突方面的理由，都不能作为任何国家武装干涉另一国家内政的根据。不论借口如何，对另一个国家首先使用军队的国家所作的罪恶行为，就是侵略。
    （五）我们认为新战争的宣传造成了对各国人民和平合作的最大威胁，是对人类最残忍的罪行之一。我们号召世界各国的议会通过保障和平的法律，规定不论以任何形式进行新战争宣传均应负刑事责任。
    （六）全体正直人民不问政治信仰如何，都一致认为残暴无情地大规模灭绝平民的行动是对全人类的罪行。我们要求由国际有权威的委员会调查在朝鲜所犯的罪行，应该明确地说，调查麦克阿瑟将军的责任问题。
    （七）我们热望着为全人类确保稳固而持久的和平，特提出下列建议，请联合国、各国议会和各国人民加以考虑，这些建议表达了承担着沉重的军事预算负担的人民的切身需要。
    无条件禁止各种原子武器、细菌和化学武器、毒气、放射性武器以及其他大规模毁灭人类的工具；宣布首先使用这些武器的政府为战争罪犯。
    第二届世界保卫和平大会认识到它对各国人民的责任，特向各大国发出庄严的呼吁，并向它们建议在一九五一年到一九五二年期间，按比例同时逐渐裁减一切军队——陆军、空军和海军——裁减量从三分之一到二分之一。
    这种措施将使军备竞赛受到决定性的限制，并将减少侵略的危险，而有助于减轻沉重地压在各阶层人民身上的国家军事预算。它还将促进国际互信的恢复，以及各国间（不问它们的制度如何）必要的协调的恢复。
    大会宣告：对禁止原子武器及其他大规模毁灭人类的武器实行管制，以及对通常军备和裁减军备实行管制，在技术上是可以实现的。应在安全理事会之下建立具有权威监督权的国际管制机关。这个机关的职责应为实施管制以监督裁减军备及监督禁止原子、细菌、化学及其他大规模毁灭性的武器。为使其有效起见，这种管制不仅应适用于军队，适用于每一国家所已宣布的现有的军备和军备生产，而且在国际管制委员会的要求之下，并应监督计划中的军队和在宣布以外的现有的军备和军备生产。
    这些裁减军队的建议，是普遍彻底的裁军的第一阶段，这种普遍彻底的裁军就是和平战士们的终极目标。
    第二届世界保卫和平大会确认以军备竞赛来追求均势，是不能保障和平的。大会坚决认为它所提出的措施，决不会使任何一方在军事上占任何便宜，而且毫无疑问地会避免战争，保障安全，并提高世界各国人民的福利。
    我们要求大家注意，若干国家走上战争经济的轨道，已愈来愈使国际间的经济关系以及原料和制成品的交换脱离正轨，使许多国家的人民的生活水准遭受悲惨的影响，妨碍经济的进步和各国间认真的合作，长此下去并将成为冲突——对和平事业的威胁——的根源。我们从各国人民的切身利益出发，并为改善国际形势而努力，特建议在满足人民要求的互利的条件下，恢复各国间正常的贸易关系，取消任何形式的歧视，以确保各国国民经济的发展和大小国家的经济发展。
    （八）我们相信：破坏各国人民间的文化关系，会造成不和，丧失相互间的了解，造成了不信任并助长战争宣传。同时，我们相信：加强各族人民间的文化关系，会在争取和平的共同斗争中造成互相了解和信任的条件。因此，我们向各国政府呼吁：促进各国人民间文化关系的改善，促进各国人民文化宝藏的相互研究。我们建议：提倡组织文化界领袖的国际会议，互相访问他们的国家，大规模出版其他国家人民的文学书籍，并熟识他们的艺术。
    （九）我们要求联合国不要辜负各国人民对它的期望，我们请联合国注意我们所设立的世界保卫和平委员会，这是一个包括世界各国人民的代表在内的、有充分代表性的机关，其中有联合国会员国的代表，也有非联合国会员的代表，而且也包括那些目前仍旧是附属国和殖民地国家的人民的代表。
    世界保卫和平委员会吁请联合国以实际行动来履行它所负担的加强和发展国际和平合作的职责。世界保卫和平委员会担负着符合各国人民切身利益、确保稳固与持久和平的崇高任务。世界保卫和平委员会将使全人类相信：尽管目前存在着不能过低估计的困难，但它必将完成它的使命。
