　　The Beijing Women's Circle Anti-American and Aid Korea, Defend the Home and Defend the Country Committee
    Invited Han Xueye and Cui Chengxi to Give Lectures
    The venue was filled with the deep friendship between the Chinese and North Korean people and hatred for American imperialism.
    [Our newspaper dispatch] The Beijing Women's Circle Anti-American and Aid Korea, Defend the Home and Defend the Country Committee invited Han Xueye, Chairman of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace, and Cui Chengxi, a Korean People's Artist, to give lectures at the auditorium of the Third Women's Middle School on the 25th. More than 1,000 women from all walks of life attended the meeting. At the meeting, Han Xueye first earnestly expressed his respect to the volunteer army troops who went to Korea to oppose American aggression and to the mothers who fought bravely in the rear. In a sorrowful tone, he described the tragic life of the Korean people under Japanese rule for 36 years and the great persecution and massacres suffered by the South Korean people under the rule of American imperialism for the past five years. He was very moved by the surging Anti-American and Aid Korea movement of the Chinese people. He said: "The Chinese people regard the affairs of Korea as their own, and send their husbands and sons to the Korean front. This is the most powerful explanation that the Chinese people regard the Korean people as their own brothers." Cui Chengxi described in very kind and moving words the heroic struggles of the Korean sisters under the brutal massacre of the American imperialists and the contributions of the Korean artists to the motherland. She also expressed her deep gratitude to the Chinese people, from the twelve-year-old little sisters to the sixty-three-year-old old mothers, who volunteered to sign up to participate in the movement to support Korea. She said: "Now the so-called 'humanitarianism' of the American imperialists in Korea is to indiscriminately bomb peaceful residents, indiscriminately bomb elementary school students going to school, and mothers carrying children. The so-called 'American civilization' and 'American way of life' is to rape women, drag female students into tanks and gang rape them, and vainly attempt to conquer the Korean people with this kind of behavior." Finally, she told us that the Korean artists are working hard on the front lines and in the rear, and they must learn from the Soviet and Chinese artists to step up their work, to avenge the parents, brothers, sisters, and husbands who sacrificed under the American imperialist aggression, and hope that for the sake of winning the final victory, the sisters of China and North Korea will work together to fight the American imperialist aggressors to the end. The emotions of the audience closely followed the speakers' anger, grief, sincerity, enthusiasm, firmness, and excitement. The venue was always filled with the deep friendship between the Chinese and North Korean people. Finally, the Peking University Drama Society performed "Accusation," which further strengthened and encouraged everyone's determination to resist the United States and aid Korea and defend the country.

　　京市妇女界抗美援朝保家卫国委员会
    邀请韩雪野崔承喜讲演   
    会场上洋溢着中朝两国人民的深厚友情及对美帝的仇恨
    【本报讯】北京市妇女界抗美援朝保家卫国委员会二十五日在女三中礼堂邀请朝鲜保卫和平全国民族委员会委员长韩雪野和朝鲜人民艺术家崔承喜讲演。到会有各界妇女一千余人。会上韩雪野首先恳切地向为反对美国侵略而到朝鲜去的志愿军部队和在后方英勇斗争的母亲们表示敬意。他以沉痛的语调叙述朝鲜人民在日本统治下三十六年的悲惨生活和南朝鲜人民在美帝国主义统治下五年来所遭遇到的大迫害与大屠杀。他对中国人民风起云涌的抗美援朝运动非常感动。他说：“中国人民把朝鲜的事当作自己的事，把自己的丈夫、儿子送到朝鲜前线，这是中国人民把朝鲜人民当作自己弟兄的最有力的说明。”崔承喜用非常亲切而感动的话叙述了朝鲜姊妹们在美帝残暴屠杀下的英勇斗争和朝鲜艺术家对祖国的贡献。她并对中国的从十二岁的小妹妹到六十三岁的老母亲都自愿签名参加支援朝鲜的运动表示深深的谢意。他说：“现在美帝在朝鲜所谓的‘人道主义’就是滥炸和平居民，滥炸上学去的小学生，背着小孩子的母亲，所谓‘美国文明’和‘美国生活方式’就是强奸妇女，把女学生拉到坦克内轮奸，妄想用这种行为来征服朝鲜人民。”最后她告诉我们朝鲜的艺术家们正在前线在后方努力工作着，并且一定要向苏联和中国的艺术家们学习加紧工作，为替在美帝侵略下而牺牲的父母、兄弟、姊妹、丈夫而报仇，并希望为争取最后的胜利，中朝两国的姊妹们共同努力向美帝侵略者斗争到底。听众的情绪紧随着讲演人的愤怒、悲痛、诚恳、热情、坚定、兴奋而转变。会场上始终洋溢着中朝两国人民的深厚友情。最后由北大剧社演出“控诉”，更加坚定和鼓舞了大家抗美援朝保家卫国的斗志。
