　　The Korean people hate the "Korean Devils" just as much as the Chinese people do. After visiting several Korean expatriates in Beijing, I deeply understood this point.

　　Kim Myung-hwan, a Korean doctor at Jilin Dental Hospital, pointed to the "Answering Readers' Questions" article on the People's Daily on November 18, "Aid to Korea is Precisely to Oppose the 'Korean Devils,'" and said to me: "In the past, there were indeed some vile Koreans who did bad things. It's no wonder that Chinese people have misunderstandings about Koreans." Ma Chaoqun, a Korean teacher in the Department of Oriental Languages at Peking University, told me sadly: "Japanese imperialism, in order to use Korean traitors to rule the Korean people and to alienate the feelings between the Chinese and Korean people, deliberately created a group of 'Korean Devils' who sold heroin and opened 'small pawnshops' (a highly exploitative pawn business) in the areas it occupied to poison and exploit the Chinese people. When the Japanese bandits arrested, beat, and killed people, they all used Korean translators and secret agents to come forward, making the Chinese feel that Koreans were nothing but heroin dealers and lackeys, with not a single good person among them. Therefore, among the Chinese people, a hatred of the term 'Korean Devil' has been left for many years."

　　In fact, not only the Chinese people suffered from the persecution of the "Korean Devils," just as the Chinese people suffered from the persecution of the Kuomintang bandit gang and the traitorous lackeys, the Korean people also suffered from the persecution of the "Korean Devils." All the "Korean Devils" who sold heroin were lackeys of the Japanese bandits in the past, and now they have become lackeys of American imperialism. Countless Korean patriots have been betrayed and framed by them and sacrificed. The Korean people all feel that the Korean traitors are as vicious as the Japanese police. Dr. Kim Myung-hwan said that when the Japanese bandits occupied Beijing, the director of the Special Higher Police Section (an agency dedicated to torturing political prisoners) of the Japanese consulate was a Korean traitor. The Korean people were arrested and killed by the Japanese bandits because those Korean traitors reported them. At that time, there was a Yanyou Football Team among the Korean expatriates in Beijing. One of the players had progressive books buried under the floor of his house. After reading them, he buried them again as before. This matter was reported to the Japanese bandits by a Korean traitor. As a result, all the players were arrested and detained. The player Wen Siche died from severe torture. Dr. Gao Junjiu of the Gao Couple's Dental Hospital told me that in 1938, he and Dr. Kim Hyun-taek of the then Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Professor Zhu Yuese of Fu Jen Catholic University, An Yuansheng, and several other Korean expatriates gathered once a week to eat some Korean cold noodles and play. As a result, they were reported to the Japanese bandits by a Korean traitor on the grounds of unhealthy ideology. Several of them were arrested, and in addition to being beaten and imprisoned, two of them were expelled from Beijing. Dr. Gao said: "We not only suffered all kinds of traps from this group of bad guys, but also because they sold heroin, many Chinese people misunderstood our Korean people, despised us, and hated us. We hate these bad guys as much as the Chinese people do!" Mr. Ma Chaoqun once angrily told me, "If one in ten million Koreans sold heroin, then this entire nation should be wiped off the face of the earth!"

　　But the "Korean Devils" are only a very small part of the thirty million Korean people. The broad masses of the Korean people are irreconcilable with them. Mr. Ma Chaoqun gave several examples. He said: On the eve of the September 18th Incident, the Japanese bandits created the Wanbaoshan Incident, using the pretext of conflicts between the Chinese and Korean people to occupy the Northeast. At that time, a Korean traitor reporter spread rumors in the newspaper, saying that the Chinese had killed so many Korean people. As a result, it also provoked conflicts between the Chinese and Korean people in Korea. This kind of incident made Korean patriots extremely sad and indignant. A month later, they executed this insane Korean traitor. Dr. Kim Myung-hwan said that in 1943, when he returned to Korea from Beijing, many Koreans in Seoul scolded the "Korean Devils" in North China when they saw him. Some even misunderstood that there was not a single good Korean in North China. After the Japanese bandits surrendered, Dr. Gao Junjiu himself in Beijing used the method of prohibiting the children of heroin dealers from attending Korean schools to crack down on the "Korean Devils."

　　Where have those "Korean Devils" gone now? According to Mr. Ma Chaoqun and Dr. Kim Myung-hwan, after the Japanese bandits surrendered, the vile Korean traitors who sold heroin and acted as lackeys in Beijing gradually reformed for the better. Those who were the most reactionary and shameless all ran to South Korea to serve Syngman Rhee and became American imperialist lackeys, continuing to do evil. They all hate this group of Korean scum. Even Yu Jiaochun and Xiao Chengji, eleven- and twelve-year-old elementary school students at the Korean Elementary School in Beijing, said: The most hateful are Syngman Rhee and his group of traitors. They used to be lackeys for the Japanese, and now they are lackeys for the Americans. We must eliminate them!

　　A small group of "Korean Devils" created by the Japanese bandits once caused some Chinese people to misunderstand the Korean people. But this misunderstanding is now gradually being eliminated. This is something that the Korean people are very happy about. Quan Dejun—a Korean expatriate who once joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army and fought alongside the Chinese people to eliminate the American and Chiang bandits—excitedly told me: "I saw the propaganda team of Fu Jen Catholic University on the street talking about the distinction between the Korean people and the 'Korean Devils,' and I felt very happy." Dr. Kim Myung-hwan, Mr. Ma Chaoqun, and Dr. Gao Junjiu all affirmed to me: "Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and General Kim Il-sung, 'Korean Devil' behavior will never be allowed to appear. After the Syngman Rhee bandit gang is eliminated, this shameful term will be eliminated from then on."

### 朝鲜人民心目中的“高丽棒子”

　　朝鲜人民心目中的“高丽棒子”
    ·卢念高·
    朝鲜人民是和中国人民一样地痛恨“高丽棒子”。当我访问了几位在京的朝鲜侨民之后，深深地了解到这一点。
    鸡林牙科医院的朝籍大夫金明焕指着十一月十八日人民日报上“援朝正是为了反对‘高丽棒子’”那篇《答读者问》对我说：“以前的确有些下流的朝鲜人做过坏事。不怪中国人对朝鲜人有误会。”北大东方语文学系的朝籍教师马超群先生沉痛地告诉我：“日本帝国主义为了利用朝奸统治朝鲜人民，为了离间中朝人民的感情，故意制造一批‘高丽棒子’，在它占领的地区里卖白面、开‘小押当’（一种高度剥削的当业），来毒害和剥削中国人。日寇捉人打人杀人，都用朝鲜翻译特务出面，使中国人觉得朝鲜人除了卖白面就当狗腿子，没有一个好人。因此，在中国人方面多年来就留下了一个‘高丽棒子’的仇恨称呼。”
    实际上不只中国人民受“高丽棒子”的迫害，正像中国人民受国民党匪帮和汉奸狗腿子的迫害一样，朝鲜人民也同样地受“高丽棒子”的迫害。凡是卖白面的“高丽棒子”，过去都是日寇的狗腿子，现在就成为美帝国主义的狗腿子。朝鲜爱国志士受他们出卖陷害而牺牲的不计其数。朝鲜人民都觉得朝奸和日本警察一样的恶毒。金明焕大夫说，在日寇占领北京时，日寇领事馆的特高课（专事残害政治犯的机关）主任就是个朝奸。朝鲜人民受日寇的捕杀，都是那些朝奸给告的密。当时北京朝鲜侨民有个燕友足球队，其中有个队员住的屋子地下发现埋有进步书籍，他看了以后又照旧埋回去。这件事被朝奸报告了日寇。结果，所有的队员都被捉去押起来。队员文思哲就因受刑惨重而死掉了。高氏夫妇牙科医院的朝籍大夫高俊九告我说，一九三八年，他和当时的协和医院金显宅大夫、辅大教授朱约瑟、安原生等几个朝鲜侨民，每星期六聚会一次，吃点朝鲜的冷面，玩一玩。结果被朝奸以思想不良的罪名报告了日寇，他们几个人都被捉去，除了挨打坐牢外，还有两个被轰出北京。高大夫说：“我们不只受这群坏蛋的种种陷害，而且因为他们卖白面，以致许多中国人对我们朝鲜人民发生误解，轻视我们，恨我们。对于这些坏蛋，我们和中国人民一样地恨他们！”马超群先生曾气愤地告诉我，“如果三千万朝鲜人中，有一千万卖白面，那么这个整个民族都应该从地球上消灭掉！”
    但是“高丽棒子”只是三千万朝鲜人中极少的一部分。广大的朝鲜人民和他们是势不两立的。马超群先生举了几个例子。他说：“九一八”前夕，日寇制造万宝山事件，借口中朝人民冲突，侵占了东北。当时有个朝奸记者在报上造谣，说中国人打死了多少多少朝鲜人。结果，又挑起了朝鲜国内中朝人民的冲突。这种事件使朝鲜爱国志士悲愤万分。一个月后，他们就把这个丧心病狂的朝奸给处死了。金明焕大夫说，一九四三年他从北京回朝鲜，许多汉城的朝鲜人见了他，都大骂在华北的“高丽棒子”，有的甚至误会到在华北的朝鲜人没有一个好东西。在日寇投降后，高俊九大夫本人在北京就曾用禁止卖白面的子女上朝鲜学校的方法打击过“高丽棒子”。
    现在那些“高丽棒子”到那里去了呢？据马超群先生和金明焕大夫讲，在日寇投降后，当初在北京卖白面、当狗腿子的下流朝奸，较好的都逐渐改邪归正了。那些最反动无耻的，都跑到南朝鲜去投效李承晚，作了美帝的走狗，继续作恶。他们都很痛恨这群朝鲜败类。连北京朝鲜小学的十一、二岁的小学生俞教淳、萧承吉都说：顶数李承晚这群卖国贼可恶。从前他们给日本人当狗腿子，现在又给美国人当狗腿子，非把他们消灭不可！
    一小撮日寇制造的“高丽棒子”曾经使一部分中国人民对朝鲜人民发生误解。但是这种误解，现在已经逐渐地在消除。这是朝鲜人民非常高兴的事。全德均——一位曾经参加中国人民解放军，为消灭美蒋匪帮曾与中国人民并肩战斗的朝鲜侨民——兴奋地告我说：“我在街上看见辅仁大学宣传队在讲朝鲜人民和‘高丽棒子’的分别，我感觉非常痛快。”金明焕大夫、马超群先生和高俊九大夫都肯定地告诉我：“在毛主席和金日成将军领导下，绝不允许有‘高丽棒子’的行为出现。在李承晚匪帮消灭后，这个可耻的称呼，将会从此消灭。”
