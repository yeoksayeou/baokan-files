　　Introduction to the Current Situation in Northern Vietnam
    Since mid-September, when the Vietnamese People's Army launched a powerful offensive on the northern border of Vietnam, it has successively liberated seven important strongholds in the northeastern border areas of Cao Bang and Lang Son (Cao Bang, Dong Khe, That Khe, Na Cham, Dong Dang, Lang Son, Loc Binh). On the northwestern border, the Vietnamese People's Army has simultaneously cleared the French military outposts around Lao Cai on the left bank of the Red River: Bao Ha, Hoang Thu Phi, Bac Xa, and Mong Khang. Now, the French garrison in Lao Cai, as well as the French forces in Hoa Binh, the capital of Hoa Binh province southwest of Hanoi, have finally been forced to abandon the city and flee. The main base of the Vietnamese people's resistance war, the Viet Bac Interzone, has been completely connected. The series of victories of the Vietnamese People's Army on the northern border have greatly changed the situation in northern Vietnam. The Vietnamese People's Army has crushed the entire French defense system on the northeastern and northwestern borders of Vietnam, directly threatening Hanoi and the Red River Delta.
    Northern Vietnam was once the base of the Vietnamese people's anti-Japanese war, and most of it has been a liberated area since the "August Revolution" in 1945. Its administrative area is divided into two major military regions: the "Viet Bac Interzone" and the "Third Interzone." The "Viet Bac Interzone" is the mountainous area of ​​northern Vietnam. The French army established two lines of defense here, one on the northeastern border from Cao Bang via Lang Son to Mong Cai; the other on the northwestern border with Lao Cai as the center, north to Hoang Thu Phi in Ha Giang province and southwest to Lai Chau. The purpose was to block the northern border of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and thereby form a constant threat to the Viet Bac People's Army. The liberation of Cao Bang, Lang Son and the recovery of Lao Cai completely crushed this French military intention.
    Lang Son is one of the important military strongholds on the French army's northeastern defense line in the "Viet Bac Interzone." It is the largest city on Highway 4, connecting Cao Bang in the north and Mong Cai in the southeast. It is the capital of Lang Son Province in northern Vietnam. It controls the highway leading to the Hong Gai coal mine. After launching a full-scale war of aggression against Vietnam in November 1946, French imperialists concentrated their attention on Lang Son, advanced and occupied Lang Son and Hai Phong, strengthened defenses in Lang Son, built a military airport, and have always placed its elite troops on this line. In the French military deployment, Lang Son is included in the parallelogram defense system of Lang Son, Mong Cai, Hai Phong and Hanoi. They wanted to turn Lang Son into an important stronghold for blocking the northeastern border of Vietnam. The liberation of Lang Son completely crushed this defense system of French imperialism on the northeastern border of Vietnam.
    Another important military stronghold in the "Viet Bac Interzone" is Cao Bang. Cao Bang is located northeast of Lang Son, 270 kilometers from Hanoi. It is the terminus of Highway 4 and the starting point of Highway 3. In October 1947, the French army occupied the city with paratroopers. France also placed its elite troops here. On September 18 this year, the Vietnamese People's Army captured Dong Khe, cutting off the French army's connection between Cao Bang and Lang Son. The French army in Cao Bang had to flee in panic, but was completely annihilated by the People's Army during the retreat.
    Lao Cai, from which the French army recently withdrew, is an important stronghold on the northwestern border of the "Viet Bac Interzone," facing the town of Hekou in Yunnan Province of our country across the river. When the Japanese army invaded Vietnam in 1940, it stationed heavy troops in Lao Cai, attempting to peep into Kunming. After Japan surrendered, the French army occupied Lao Cai during the winter offensive in 1947. In order to consolidate Lao Cai, the French army occupied a series of strongholds around Lao Cai, especially Po Lu, Bao Ha, Pu Liang and An Ping communes on the right bank of the Red River. From the end of 1948, the Vietnamese People's Army launched offensives in northwestern Vietnam, liberating large areas of Lai Chau, Son La and Lao Cai provinces. The famous battles include the "Lao (Cai) Ha (Giang) Campaign" in early 1949 and the "Red River Campaign" in July of the same year. In the latter campaign, the Vietnamese People's Army eliminated 25 French military outposts south of Lao Cai town. In May 1950, the Vietnamese People's Army destroyed the French military outpost of Po Lu after six days of fighting. Since then, Lao Cai has become an isolated stronghold. After the French army failed in Cao Bang and Lang Son, it declared that "they will no longer withdraw from any stronghold," but when the powerful Vietnamese People's Army crossed the Red River and prepared to encircle Lao Cai from the east, the French army in Lao Cai had no choice but to abandon this last major stronghold in the north and flee to the southwest.
    The complete liberation of the "Viet Bac Interzone" directly threatens the "Third Interzone," another administrative region of northern Vietnam. The "Third Interzone" includes the Red River Delta of Hanoi, Hai Phong and Nam Dinh. This area is the rice-producing area of ​​northern Vietnam and the main base of the French aggressors. The French army has about 70,000 troops stationed in this area, defending several major strongholds such as Hanoi, Hai Phong, Nam Dinh and Ninh Binh. Recently, after the People's Army launched offensives in Cao Bang and Lang Son, the French army attempted to withdraw its troops to this area to strengthen the defense of Hanoi, but this attempt by the French army did not materialize, and all the French troops on the Cao Bang and Lang Son lines were annihilated. At the same time, in the vast rural areas of this area, the people's armed forces still control the area. Recently, the local troops of the Vietnamese People's Army have continuously launched attacks in Nam Dinh, Thai Binh, Ninh Binh and other provinces, destroying many French military outposts and forcing the French army to withdraw from many areas. This shows that the Vietnamese people's armed forces in the Red River Delta are also constantly growing and expanding.

　　越北现势介绍
    越南人民军自九月中旬在越北边境发动强大攻势以来，已先后解放东北边境高平、谅山地区的重要据点七处（高平、东溪、七溪、那岑、同登、谅山、禄平）。在西北边境，越南人民军已同时肃清了红河左岸老开周围的法军据点保河、黄树菲、柏溪、孟康。现在，老开的法国守军以及河内西南和平省首府和平的法军，也终于被迫弃城逃窜。越南人民的主要抗战基地——越北联区，已完全联成一片了。越南人民军在北部边境一连串的胜利，已使越北局势大为改观。越南人民军已打垮法军在越南东北和西北边境的整个防御体系。直接威胁河内和红河三角洲的法军。
    越南北部曾是越南人民抗日战争的根据地，一九四五年“八月革命”以来大部即为解放区。其行政区域划分为“越北联区”和“第三联区”两大军区。“越北联区”为越北的山岳地区。法军在这里建立了两条防线，一条在东北边境自高平经谅山到芒街；另一条在西北边境以老开为中心，北至河江省的黄树菲、西南至莱州。其目的在封锁越南民主共和国的北部边境，并借此形成对越北人民军的经常威胁。高平、谅山等地的解放及老开的收复，完全打垮了法军的这一军事意图。
    谅山是“越北联区”内法军东北防线上的重要军事据点之一，为第四号公路上的最大城市，北通高平，东南至芒街，是越北谅山省的省会。它控制着通往鸿基煤矿的公路。法帝国主义者在一九四六年十一月发动全面侵略越南战争后，即将注意力集中在谅山，进兵占领谅山和海防，在谅山加强防务，修建军用飞机场，并且一直把它的精锐部队放置在这一线上。在法国的军事布置中，谅山是包括在谅山、芒街、海防和河内的平行四边形的防御体系中的。他们想把谅山变为封锁越南东北边境的重要据点。谅山的解放，完全打垮了法帝国主义在越南东北边境的这一防御体系。
    “越北联区”的另一个重要的军事据点是高平。高平位谅山东北，距河内二百七十公里，是第四号公路的终点，同时是第三号公路的起点。一九四七年十月，法军以降落伞部队占领该城。法国在这里也同样放置了它的精锐部队。今年九月十八日，越南人民军攻占东溪、切断了高平与谅山的法军的联系，高平法军不得不狼狈溃逃。但在溃逃途中已被人民军全部歼灭。
    最近法军撤退的老开，是“越北联区”西北边陲的重要据点，与我国云南省河口镇隔河相望。日军在一九四○年侵占越南时，曾在老开屯驻重兵，企图进窥昆明。日本投降后，法军于一九四七年冬季攻势中，占领了老开，为了巩固老开，法军曾在老开周围占领了一系列的据点，特别是红河右岸的坡鲁、保河、溥良和安平社等。从一九四八年年底起，越南人民军即陆续在越北西北部发动攻势，解放了莱州、山罗和老开等省的广大地区，著名的战役有一九四九年初的“老（开）河（江）战役”和同年七月的“红河战役”，在后一战役中越南人民军消灭了老开镇南部的二十五个法军据点。一九五○年五月，越南人民军经过六天的战斗，摧毁了法军据点坡鲁。从此以后，老开就变成孤立的据点。法军在高平谅山失败后，即扬言“他们不再自任何据点撤退”，但当强大的越南人民军横渡红河准备从东面包围老开时，老开的法军却不得不放弃这北部的最后一个大据点而向西南逃窜。
    “越北联区”的全部解放，直接威胁到越北的另一行政区“第三联区”。“第三联区”包括河内、海防和南定的红河三角洲。这一带是越南北部的产米区，也是法国侵略军的主要根据地。法军在这一地区驻有七万左右的兵力，据守河内、海防、南定和宁平等几个主要据点。最近人民军在高平、谅山发动攻势后，法军即企图将兵力撤至这一区域，增防河内，但是法军的这一企图没有实现，高平和谅山一线的法军全部被歼灭了。同时，在这一地区内广大的农村，仍控制在人民武装手中。最近，越南人民军地方部队不断在南定、太平、宁平等省出击，摧毁不少法军据点，迫使法军从不少地区撤退。这显示着红河三角洲越南人民武装力量，也正在不断地成长和壮大。
