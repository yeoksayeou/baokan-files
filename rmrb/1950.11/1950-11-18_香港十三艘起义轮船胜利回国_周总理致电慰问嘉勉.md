    Xinhua News Agency, November 17th: After the entire staff of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in Hong Kong, who staged an uprising, victoriously sailed thirteen ships back to the people's motherland, Premier Zhou Enlai sent a telegram on the 15th of this month to managers Tang Chuanchi and Chen Tianjun and all the uprising staff to express his condolences and commendation. The telegram reads: To Managers Tang Chuanchi and Chen Tianjun and all comrades of the uprising staff:

    You have persisted in the struggle to protect assets in Hong Kong for more than nine months, crushed all the persecution and obstruction by imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and finally victoriously sailed all the uprising ships back to the people's motherland. Your heroic and unyielding struggle has made a great contribution to safeguarding the property of the motherland and developing the people's shipping industry. It is hoped that you will study hard and strive to further develop the people's shipping industry.

    Zhou Enlai, November 15th
    Xinhua News Agency, November 17th: The entire staff of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in Hong Kong, who announced their uprising at the beginning of this year, finally victoriously sailed thirteen ships back to the motherland after more than nine months of struggle to protect assets. Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council of the Central People's Government, and Zhang Bojun, Minister of the Ministry of Communications, successively sent telegrams to the two managers of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Tang Chuanchi and Chen Tianjun, and all the uprising staff to express their condolences and encouragement.

    Since the Hong Kong China Merchants Steam Navigation Company announced its uprising on January 13th of this year, under the leadership of the two managers Tang and Chen, all the staff and thirteen ships, the imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang have carried out various persecutions and obstructions against the uprising staff. The Hong Kong government even announced emergency measures in early August, implementing so-called ship and aircraft import and export controls, vainly attempting to detain the uprising ships from sailing back to the mainland. However, under the encouragement of Premier Zhou's instructions, all the uprising staff heroically and resourcefully persisted in the struggle to protect assets for more than nine months, and finally achieved complete victory. From July 13th to October 21st, all the uprising staff had safely sailed all thirteen ships back to the people's motherland. The names of these thirteen ships are: Min 302 (tugboat), Min 312 (tugboat), Zhong 106, Haikang, Haixia, Deng Yu, Deng Keng, Lin Sen, Cai E, Jiao Ren, Hong Zhang, Chenggong, Hai Han; the total tonnage is 25,833 tons, and the deadweight tonnage is 31,133 tons. The return of these ships to the people's motherland has added a new force to the new China's people's shipping industry.
