Batang (also known as Ba'an) is a famous city in central Xikang and a central station for transportation between Sichuan and Tibet via the southern route. The entire city has a population of approximately 30,000, with over 95% being Tibetan compatriots. It is rich in products and serves as a transfer station for goods transported from the mainland to the Kang Tibetan region, as well as a distribution center for local products from other areas of Xikang.

Successive reactionary rulers used this place as one of the centers for ruling Tibetan compatriots. The people of Batang also have a glorious tradition of resisting reactionary rule. In 1905, the people of Batang killed Feng Quan, the Qing Emperor's envoy. The ethnic oppressor Zhao Erfeng led Qing troops in a brutal massacre, killing nearly 300 Tibetan compatriots. In 1920, the people of Batang resisted the tyrannical rule of the warlords, which also resulted in severe suppression, with over eighty houses burned down and four people murdered. In the subsequent twenty years, the warlord rulers carried out four massacres. After the Kuomintang forces extended their reach, they established a special agent rule in Batang and conducted enslaving education.

After 1939, progressive youths from Batang traveling to Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan brought back Mao Zedong Thought, and Communist Party organizations began to be established among workers and youth. At the end of 1949, Ping Cuo Wangjie, the earliest Communist Party member in Batang, formed the "Kang Tibetan Border Local Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party" according to instructions from higher authorities. He led the East Tibet Democratic Youth League, uniting and educating over a hundred progressive youths. Communist Party members and league members led the People's Self-Defense Force and nearly a thousand local enlightened Tusi armed forces, preparing to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to liberate Batang. After General Liu Wenhui and others staged an uprising in early December of last year, and Xikang declared peaceful liberation, Communist Party members and advanced youths in Batang established people's primary schools and women's night schools, enrolling over 280 impoverished children and working women. In addition, they established a people's library to spread progressive ideas.

After the People's Liberation Army entered Batang on August 10th this year, this rich city on the right bank of the Jinsha River was filled with a new atmosphere of freedom and joy. Diao Deng, a sewing worker who once led the democratic struggle, and Zeng Que Zha, a leather worker, became the acting chief and deputy chief of the county people's government. Close mutual assistance unfolded between the People's Liberation Army and Tibetan compatriots. Soldiers helped Tibetan compatriots with harvesting and repairing canals, and established a clinic to provide free medical treatment for the people. Many Tibetan men and women voluntarily participated in shipbuilding, logging, and house repair to support the liberation of Tibet.

During August and September, at Batang's first "Yadaxie" (festival for sending off summer and celebrating the harvest) after liberation, young men and women danced and sang to their hearts' content on the riverside grass field, expressing their joy after liberation. During this festival, the People's Liberation Army and the county people's government held a joint military-civilian celebration, during which propaganda was carried out against American aggression in Korea and Taiwan, and for the defense of world peace.

The people of Batang have truly begun a happy and fulfilling life. Threes and fives of working women happily sing: "Our sisters work together, gather together, never separate..."

　　西康中部名城巴塘
　　林田
    巴塘（又名巴安）是西康中部的名城，为四川通西藏南路交通的中心站。全城人口约三万，百分之九十五以上是藏胞，物产丰富，为内地运销康藏地区货物的转运站，西康其他地区土产的集散地。
    历代反动统治者都以此地为统治藏族同胞的中心之一。巴塘人民也有反抗反动统治的光荣传统。一九○五年，巴塘人民杀死过满清皇帝的钦差大臣凤全。民族压迫者赵尔丰曾率清军进行残酷屠杀，藏胞死者近三百人。一九二○年，巴塘人民曾反抗过军阀的暴虐统治，也遭到了严厉的镇压，八十多家房屋被烧毁，四人被屠杀。在此后的二十多年间，军阀统治者曾进行了四次的屠杀。国民党势力伸入后，在巴塘建立了特务统治，并进行奴化教育。
    一九三九年以后，从巴塘到川、黔、滇的进步青年带回了毛泽东思想，在工人、青年中开始建立了共产党组织。一九四九年底，巴塘最早的共产党员凭错旺阶按照上级指示，组成了“中国共产党康藏边地方工作委员会”，并领导东藏民主青年同盟，团结教育着进步青年百余人。共产党员和盟员们曾经领导人民自卫队和当地开明土司武装近千人，准备着配合人民解放军解放巴塘。去年十二月上旬，刘文辉将军等举行起义，西康宣告和平解放后，巴塘的共产党员和先进青年们便在当地举办人民小学、妇女夜校，吸收了二百八十多名贫苦儿童和劳动妇女入学。此外，还举办了人民图书馆，传播进步思想。
    解放军于今年八月十日进驻巴塘后，这座金沙江右岸丰饶的名城就到处洋溢着自由欢乐的新气象。曾经领导民主斗争的缝纫工人刁登和皮革工人曾却扎当了该县人民政府的代理正副县长。解放军和藏胞之间展开了亲密的互助。战士们帮助藏胞收割、修水渠，还设立了一个诊疗所免费替人民治病。许多男女藏胞自动参加了造船、伐木、修房等支援解放西藏的工作。
    八、九月间，巴塘解放后的第一个“雅达歇”（送夏庆丰收的节日），男女青年们在河边草坝上尽情地舞蹈着、歌唱着，表达他们解放后欢愉的心情。在这个节日，解放军和县人民政府举行了军民联欢会，会上并展开了反对美国侵略朝鲜、台湾及保卫世界和平的宣传。
    巴塘人民已真正地开始了快乐幸福的生活。三三五五的劳动妇女愉快地唱着：“我们姊妹劳动在一起，欢聚在一起，永不分离………”
