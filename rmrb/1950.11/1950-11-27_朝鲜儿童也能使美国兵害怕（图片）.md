The above photograph shows an American military policeman bending down to search a Korean child still wearing open-crotch pants, checking if he has any weapons. Not daring to trust even a three-year-old child shows how panicked the American troops in Korea are! It also shows that the American beasts' blades are not only aimed at Korean men and women, but also at Korean children! The mothers of the world and all peace-loving people must not tolerate this shameless act of barbarous treatment of children by the United States. (Note: This photo was taken by an Associated Press reporter on the banks of the Nakdong River near Daegu and published in the "Pacific Tribune" published in Vancouver, Canada on September 27.)

    上面的这张照片，是一个美国宪兵正弯下身来搜索一个还穿着开裆裤的朝鲜小孩子，看他身上有没有武器。对于三岁儿童也不敢放心，这说明在朝美军多么恐慌？！同时也说明美国野兽们的刀锋不仅向着朝鲜男女，而且也向着朝鲜的儿童！对于美国这种野蛮对待儿童的无耻行动，全世界的母亲们和一切爱好和平的人民是决不能容许的。（按此章照片系在大邱附近洛东江岸上美联社记者所摄，刊于九月二十七日加拿大温哥华出版的“太平洋论坛报”上）
