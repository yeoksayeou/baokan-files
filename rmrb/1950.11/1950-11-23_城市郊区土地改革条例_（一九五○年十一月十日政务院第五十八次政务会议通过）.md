    Article 13: When the state recovers state-owned land cultivated by farmers for municipal construction and other needs, it shall provide appropriate resettlement to the farmers cultivating the land and provide fair and reasonable compensation for their production investments on the land (such as well-drilling, tree planting, etc.) and other losses.
