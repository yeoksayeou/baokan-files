　　Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 30th -- According to TASS, Washington, 28th: One hundred and thirty-five progressive individuals from thirty-two states in the United States have issued a petition protesting the McCarran Act, demanding that the Federal District Court abolish this law and order a halt to the implementation of this fascist law. The petition states: This law infringes upon the rights of the American people and attempts to establish an "illegal police state system" in the United States. The petition continues: The McCarran Law causes people to suffer from unemployment and the inability to find new jobs. Some people, branded with the crimes of traitor and disloyalty to the United States, are deported, denied passports, slandered, and subjected to social humiliation.

　　The petition also states: This law "creates a miasma of terror," causing many people to "dare not exercise their constitutional rights, dare not speak and write freely, dare not petition for the redress of grievances, and dare not work together to seek economic security, democracy, and world peace."

　　美进步人士抗议政府法西斯措施
    要求撤销麦卡伦法案
    发出请愿书谴责侵犯人民权利
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社华盛顿二十八日讯：美国三十二州的进步人士一百三十五人，发出请愿书，抗议麦卡伦法案，要求联邦地方法院取消这个法律，并下令制止这项法西斯法律的实施。请愿书说：这个法律侵犯美国人民的权利，并且企图在美国建立“非法的警察国家的体制”。请愿书接着说：麦卡伦法律使人民受到失业与无法寻找新工作的痛苦。若干人被按上叛徒与对美国不忠诚的罪名，就被放逐出国、得不到护照，受人毁谤，并受到社会上的凌辱。
    请愿书又说：这个法律“造成恐怖的瘴气”，使得许多人“不敢行使宪法的权利，不敢自由地讲话与写作，不敢为纠正不平而请愿，不敢共同努力来谋取经济安全、民主与世界和平”。
