　　The Beijing Municipal People's Government received a letter from the Italian Democratic Cities Alliance addressed to Mayor Nie of Beijing, mentioning the situation of the peace signature campaign in various Italian cities. The original letter is as follows: Dear Mr. Mayor:
　　We are writing to you, the distinguished representative of the broad masses of citizens, in the name of all citizens of Italian cities. We are connected with your citizens through a long history of friendly, cultural, and humanitarian relations.
　　All our cities suffered heavy losses in the recent World War; many of them still bear visible traces of destruction and devastation in their ancient squares and famous palaces. But just as our people and your people are concentrating on the arduous task of urban reconstruction, we are faced with an even more terrible threat of war, a new threat of total destruction. Atomic weapons not only threaten the lives, homes, and property of vast numbers of people in our country and your country, but also threaten the artistic, historical, and cultural treasures created by mankind over thousands of years. Faced with this terrible danger, people of various social, political, philosophical, and religious positions in our cities are united under a common principle - defense and humanity. Several months ago, the urban autonomous administrative personnel of our cities already expressed their desire to stop the terrible threat of atomic bombing by banning and destroying atomic weapons.
　　These days, in the face of the aggravation of the atomic threat, a meeting of the "Committee Against Atomic Weapons and Launching the Peace Signature Campaign" was held in Rome, chaired by Senator Vittorio Emanuele Orlando—former Prime Minister and Italian representative to the Versailles Peace Conference. Participants included the first President of Italy, De Nicola, as well as many prominent figures from the majority and minority parties in our parliament. Nitti, former Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Bonomi, Chairman of the Senate, and Grandi, Chairman of the Chamber of Deputies, were nominated as honorary members. Many mayors of Italian cities also joined this committee.
　　The appeal passed by the committee and announced to the press by Chairman Orlando after the meeting repeated and promoted the themes already mentioned in the international appeal by the International Red Cross, the appeal of the Stockholm Conference of the World Peace Congress, and these themes have been reiterated in the declaration issued by Bishop Santin of Trieste to the embassies of major powers.
　　The committee's appeal calls for: "All countries to declare an absolute ban on the use of atomic weapons and destroy existing atomic weapons. At the same time, major powers must agree to adopt control measures so that countries and between countries, there is objective guarantee for the implementation of this ban. Therefore, any government that violates this ban and first uses atomic bombs against the people of any other country should bear the responsibility for the crime of endangering humanity and be declared a war criminal."
　　In response to the committee's appeal, a campaign was launched in Italy on June 2 to collect millions of citizens to participate in the peace signature campaign against atomic weapons. We know that in your country, the Stockholm Peace Signature Campaign is also developing extensively.
　　We feel it is necessary to write to you: we fully agree with the appeal of the Stockholm Conference and ask you, like us, to declare your approval of this appeal for peace in the name of all citizens.
　　We, the administrators of famous cities, ourselves bear a special and unavoidable responsibility: millions of people would have reason to question us, why did we not intervene, why did we remain silent on the world peace signature movement? War is not unavoidable, war and the atomic threat can be removed from our cities. Let us spread the powerful voice of millions of citizens in all countries against the danger of destruction and death!

### 意大利民主城市联盟致北京市长的信

　　意大利民主城市联盟致北京市长的信
    北京市人民政府收到从意大利民主城市联盟寄来的致北京聂市长的信一件，其中说到意大利各城市和平签名运动的情况，原信如下：亲爱的市长先生：
    我们以意大利各城市全体市民的名义写信给您——广大市民的杰出的代表。由于友谊上、文化上和人道上的悠久关系，我们与你们的市民之间互相联系着。
    所有我们的城市，在最近一次世界大战中，都遭受过惨重的损失；其中有许多城市，在古老的广场上、著名的宫殿上，依然留着显明的破坏和毁灭的痕迹。但是正当我们的人民和你们的人民专心于艰巨的城市重建工作时，我们又面临着一个更可怕的战争威胁，一个全面破坏的新威胁。原子武器不仅威胁着我们国家和你们国家内广大人民的生命、房屋和财产，而且威胁着人类几千年来所创造的艺术的、历史的和文化的宝藏。面对着这个可怕的危险，在我们各个城市里，各种不同的社会、政治、哲学和宗教立场的各人们，都在一个一致的原则下——保卫和人道——结合在一起了。几个月前，我们各城市的城区自治行政人员，已经表示了他们的意愿，要求以禁用和销毁原子武器的办法，来制止可怕的原子轰炸的威胁。
    这些日子，面对着原子威胁的严重化，在参议院议员维托里奥·爱玛努爱勒·欧兰多——曾任总理和意大利出席凡尔赛和会的代表——的主持下，在罗马举行了一个“反对原子武器、发动和平签名委员会”的会议。参加的人有意大利第一任总统戴·尼古拉，以及我国许多属于国会中多数党和少数党的著名人物。被提名为名誉委员的，有曾任部长会议主席的尼蒂，参议院主席波诺米，和众议院主席葛朗齐，意大利许多城市的市长，也加入了这个委员会。
    由委员会通过并在会后由主席欧兰多向报界宣布的呼吁，重复了而且发扬了那些在国际间已经由国际红十字会的呼吁，世界保卫和平大会斯德哥尔摩会议的呼吁所提及的主旨，这些主旨已在特利埃斯德主教桑亭所发出的致各大国大使馆的宣言中重新提出了。
    委员会的呼吁中要求：“各国宣布绝对禁止使用原子武器，并销毁现有的原子武器，同时必须由各大国协议，采取管制的办法，使各国和各国之间，对于此项禁令的实施，有客观的保证。为此，凡违反此项禁令，对任何他国人民首先使用原子弹的政府，就应担负危害人类的罪行的责任，而被宣判为战争罪犯。”
    为了响应委员会的这个呼吁，六月二日在意大利发动了征集千百万市民参加和平签名、反对原子武器运动。我们知道，在你们的国家里，斯德哥尔摩和平签名运动也在广泛地发展中。
    我们觉得有写信给你们的必要：我们对于斯德哥尔摩会议的呼吁是完全同意的，请求你们和我们一样，以全体市民的名义，宣布赞同这种对于和平的呼吁。
    我们这些人——著名城市的行政人员们——本身担负着一个不可推辞的特殊责任：千百万人会有理由质问我们，为何没有过问，为何对于世界和平签名运动沉默不响？战争不是不可以避免的，战争和原子威胁可以从我们的城市解除。让我们把各国千百万市民反对破坏和死亡危险的有力的声音传播出来吧！
                                意大利民主城市联盟  六月十五日
