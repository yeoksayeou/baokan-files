　　Some Demobilized Servicemen in North China, After Returning to Their Hometowns, Write to Their Former Units Expressing Their Determination to Oppose Aggression
　　[Our Newspaper] News: Some demobilized servicemen in North China wrote from afar, angrily stating: They guarantee to act as a reserve force to resist American imperialist aggression. After demobilized soldiers from a certain unit of the North China Military Region safely arrived back in their hometowns in Hunan and Chabei, they were enraged by the American imperialist expansion of aggression. On October 14th and 15th, they sent letters to their former comrades in arms from Xiangxiang and Yueyang in Hunan, and from Chaigoubao and Huaian in Chabei, expressing their anger at the American imperialist expansion of the war of aggression. Wen Shijun and Wen Ronghai wrote to the Ninth Company of their original regiment, expressing the unanimous desire of all demobilized servicemen: "We are paying close attention to your actions and urgently request that you accelerate the construction of a strong national defense force, be vigilant in defending the sacred territory of the motherland, and prepare to resolutely stop the vile actions of American imperialism in frantically expanding the war of aggression!" Zhou Zhengduan, in a letter from Qingshuping, Xiangxiang, to the Seventh Company of the regiment, made specific demands of all commanders and fighters in the company: "You must resolutely obey the orders of your superiors and be a good soldier loyal to the revolution!" He more earnestly expressed his hopes to the company leaders: "At this time, you should strengthen your love for the soldiers, unite and progress together, and deal with the vicious enemy together!" In the letters from Comrade Yan Ju to the First Company of the regiment and from Comrade Tan Xizhong to the Second Squad of the First Machine Gun Company of the regiment, they revealed their infinite longing for military life. Tan Xizhong wrote: "I remember day and night the Party's teachings to me. I swear to follow Chairman Mao forever! We are completely united in our goal of defending the motherland and defending peace!" Most of the letters especially emphasized that they are starting to solve the difficulties of the families of the commanders and fighters in the team, and requested all commanders and fighters to work with peace of mind with a responsible attitude towards the revolution. Finally, they solemnly declared: They are ready at any time to strike at the American imperialist aggression.
