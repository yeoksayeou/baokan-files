Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 2nd: The diplomatic correspondent of the London Worker's Daily commented on October 27th on the Chinese People's Liberation Army's advance into Tibet, saying: Just as Wales is a part of Britain, Tibet is also a part of China. The British government recognized this fact in a note to the Chinese government in 1945. China, like Britain, is a multi-ethnic country. Britain is composed of English, Scottish and Welsh people, and China is composed of Han, Mongolian, Tibetan and other smaller ethnic groups. The entry of the Chinese People's Liberation Army into Tibet is no more an invasion than the entry of British troops into Caernarfon.

America's aggression against China's neighbor Korea and its occupation of Taiwan, America's conspiracies in China's other neighbors, and America's conspiracies in Tibet itself, make the entry of the Chinese People's Liberation Army into Tibet an urgent matter. In Tibet, the movement against Anglo-American secret agents disguised as "radio technicians" and "electrical engineers" infiltrating Tibet is growing. The Tibetan people will welcome the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which will bring them security and protect them from foreign conspiracies. The current government of Tibet feels that internal unrest is growing and sent a delegation to Beijing via India and Hong Kong at the beginning of this year to discuss the entry of the Chinese People's Liberation Army into Tibet. This delegation has been in India for several months, but due to its delays and the obstacles placed by the British government, it has not yet left India. The Common Program of the Chinese People's Government, formulated with the participation of Tibetan representatives, guarantees the autonomy of Tibet. If there is any war in Tibet, it will not be because of the Chinese People's Army, nor because of the Tibetan people, but because of the conspiracies of the officials recently sent to Tibet by the US State Department, and their exploitation of foolish and reactionary Tibetan officials.

### 英国工人日报  评我军进军西藏

    评我军进军西藏
    【新华社布拉格二日电】伦敦工人日报外交记者于十月二十七日评论中国人民解放军进军西藏说：就如威尔士是英国的一部分一样，西藏也是中国的一部分。英国政府在一九四五年致中国政府的照会中还承认这个事实。中国像英国一样，是一个多民族的国家。英国是由英格兰人、苏格兰人和威尔士人组成，中国是由汉、蒙、藏及其他较小的民族组成。中国人民解放军进入西藏，就像英国军队进入卡那封一样不是侵犯。
    美国侵略中国的邻邦朝鲜及占领台湾，美国在中国其他邻国中的阴谋，以及美国在西藏本身的阴谋等，使中国人民解放军进入西藏成为迫切的事情。在西藏，反对英美特务假装“无线电技术家”及“电气工程师”渗入西藏的运动，正日益增长。西藏人民将欢迎中国人民解放军，他们为西藏人民带来安全，使他们不受外国阴谋的伤害。西藏现政府感到内部的不靖日益增涨，在本年初曾派代表团经印度和香港前往北京讨论中国人民解放军开入西藏的问题。这个代表团在印度已有数月，但由于它的延宕及英国政府予它的阻碍，它仍未离开印度。在西藏代表参加下制订的中国人民政府的共同纲领，保证了西藏的自治。如果在西藏有任何战争的话，那将不是因为中国人民的军队，也不是因为西藏的人民，而是因为美国国务院最近派往西藏的官员们的阴谋，以及他们利用愚蠢而反动的西藏官员。
