That's America's "Election"
    Hou Xianglin
    The darkness and undemocratic nature of American politics is unimaginable without experiencing it firsthand. I was in the United States from 1945 to 1950, and because I lived with some Americans, I realized the darkness of American politics. Here, I will talk about my own little experience.
    It was around 1946 when I was doing research at a coal research institute in Pittsburgh. One of my colleagues, Mr. Depay, was a tall and strong man. Although his income was not high, he liked to drink alcohol and also liked to find women to play with outside. These habits were similar to those of ordinary American youths, but he was more generous and therefore easier to approach and be intimate with. Because we worked together and often ate together, we became very close. On November 6th, the day before the U.S. citizen voting election, he came to chat with me. After talking about some things, he asked me:
    "Lin, there is an opportunity for you to easily earn five dollars. I don't know if you would like to consider it?"
    I said, "How can I earn it?"
    He said, "We are going to vote at lunchtime tomorrow. You can take my car to 'Homestead' to cast a vote, and you can get five dollars. It won't take a few minutes."
    I said, "I am not an American citizen, how can I vote?"
    He said, "You don't have to worry about that. As long as you are willing to cast a vote, someone will take care of everything. There will be absolutely no problems."
    At that time, my understanding of American politics was not enough. I thought that the American rulers mainly relied on deception and numbing the people to control politics. I didn't know that they would actually openly cheat. This matter was really a fresh experience for me, so I slowly chatted with Depay. I learned that before the election, the local government prepared a list of voters based on voter registration. Only those whose names were on the list were allowed to vote. However, this list was very inaccurate, and there were often names of voters who did not exist on it. Party organizations hired some people to impersonate these non-existent people and vote. Depay was one of the hired voters. Tomorrow, he will go to various polling areas to cast votes for more than 20 people. He can get five dollars per vote, so he is prepared to earn more than one hundred dollars tomorrow. There was a Chinese name on their fake list. According to him, this person originally ran a laundry in Homestead, but died more than 20 years ago. However, they still registered him and put his name on the voter list. Because it would be embarrassing for a white person to vote in place of a Chinese name, they wanted to find a Chinese person to vote. Because he had a good relationship with me, he wanted to introduce this money-making opportunity to me. At that time, I thanked him for his kindness and told him that this matter was not in line with my ideals as a person, and asked him to find someone else. I also asked him if he thought it was a bad thing to vote by impersonation. He explained to me that their election was just a formality. The candidates were all nominated by party organizations and were always the private individuals of big bosses. Even if the voters disagree, they have no way to nominate their desired candidates. So, he said that his voting in this way was just earning some money from the party organization and had no bad effects. I also asked him why he was not afraid of being reported for cheating in this way. His answer was that the party organization was full of malpractices, and they did not dare to expose each other. If an outsider wanted to report, then it would be bad luck for the person who wanted to report.
    Afterwards, I inquired among the Americans I knew, and it really confirmed what Depay said. A nearby small city was much worse than Pittsburgh. Most voters elsewhere are also not very enthusiastic about elections because the object of their voting is what they call in their colloquial language: "the lesser of two evils." This experience made me more aware of the depravity and darkness of American society.

### 这就是美国的“选举”

　　这就是美国的“选举”
    侯祥麟
    美国政治的黑暗和不民主，在未亲身经历以前实在想像不到。一九四五到一九五○年间我在美国，因为和一些美国人在一起生活，才体会到美国政治的黑暗。在这里讲我自己的一点小经历。
    大约是在一九四六年，那时我在匹兹堡城的一个煤炭研究所做研究。同事有一位德培先生是个身高力壮的大汉。他收入虽然不多，但却喜欢喝酒，亦爱在外面找女人玩。这些习惯和一般美国青年差不多，不过他为人比较豪爽，所以较易和人接近亲热。因为我们在一起工作，亦常在一起吃饭，所以我们混得很熟。在十一月六日，就是美国公民投票选举的前一天，他来找我聊天。在谈了一些事情后他问我说：
    “麟，有个机会可以让你很易的赚五块钱，不知道你愿不愿意考虑？”
    我说：“怎样赚法？”
    他：“明天午饭时我们要去投票，你可以坐我的车子一道去‘霍姆斯特’投一票，就可以得五块钱，花不了几分钟。”
    我：“我又不是美国公民，怎么可以投票？”
    他：“这你可不用管，只要你肯去投一投，各事都有人理妥，绝不会出毛病的。”
    那时我对美国的政治认识还不够，以为美国统治者主要是靠欺骗和麻醉人民的方法来控制政治，不知道他们居然还公开作弊。这事对我实在是个新鲜的经验，因之慢慢和德培聊。才知道原来他们在选举之前，地方政府根据选民的登记预备好一份选民的名单，要单子上有名的才许投票。不过这名单很不确实，常有许多并不存在的选民的名字在上面。政党机构就雇用一些人冒名代替这些不存在的人们投票。德培是被雇投票人之一，他在明天将去各投票区域投二十几个人的票，每票他可得五块钱，这样他明天预备收入一百多元。他们的假名单里头有一个中国人的名字。据他说这个人原在霍姆斯特开洗衣店，但已在二十几年前去世，不过他们仍然替他登记，把他的名字列在选民名单上。因为中国人的名字不好意思让白人代替投票，所以要找个中国人去投。他因为和我感情不坏，所以想把这赚钱的机会介绍给我。当时我谢谢他的好意后跟他说这事和我为人的理想不合，请他另找别人，并问他这样冒名投票，是否觉得是不大好的行为。他和我解释说他们的选举只是一种形式。候选人都是政党机构提出来的，总是大老板的私人，选民虽不同意，但亦无法提出他们所要的候选人。所以他这样投票，只是赚点政党机构的钱，并没有什么不好的效果。我又问他这样作弊，为什么不怕人举发。他的回答是政党机构弊端重重，都不敢互相揭发。倘若有外人想举发，那是该那想举发人倒霉的。
    事后我在认识的美国人中间探听，果然证实德培所说。有个附近的小城市比匹城糟得更多多。别处的选民亦大多对选举颇不热心，因为他们投票选举的对象是他们口头语所谓：“二个坏人中较不坏的”。这经验使我更认识美国社会的堕落和黑暗。
