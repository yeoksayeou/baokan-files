　　Teachers College Holds Final Street Propaganda, Regular Summary of Experiences, and Celebratory Gathering

　　[Our Newspaper] Beijing Normal University has now victoriously concluded the arduous task of conducting extensive propaganda in factories, schools, and among citizens. On the 19th, students from the First Academy divided into eight teams and went to the outer city's Districts 6, 8, and 9 to conduct street propaganda. Many police station comrades prepared boiled water for the students. The propaganda teams advanced majestically; the neat steps of the waist drum team and the yangko team attracted more people. The propaganda teams returned to school successively until 5:30 pm.

　　The school also decided to hold an experience summary of this propaganda campaign and a celebration meeting for all teachers, students, and staff on the 21st.

　　[Another Dispatch] The Second Academy Propaganda Team of Teachers College has been conducting propaganda in factories and schools for a week, and on the 19th, they went to the streets again. The Chinese Department was in the Baozi Street area, the Foreign Languages ​​Department was at Taiping Lake, and the History Department was in the Piku Hutong area. From 12:00 to 5:00, each department performed four shows, with a total of approximately 4,500 viewers. When the Chinese Department was conducting propaganda, an old lady looked at the map and asked, "Where is Korea? Where is China?" After a student pointed it out to her, she said: "Oh! It's only separated by a line, we should take care of the Korean war, that's right."

    【本报讯】北京师范大学现已把深入工厂、学校、市民进行广泛宣传的艰巨任务胜利结束。十九日一院同学分八队出动到外城六、八、九区进行了街头宣传。很多派出所同志们都给同学们预备开水。宣传队伍雄壮地前进着；腰鼓队和秧歌队齐整的步伐吸引着更多的群众。直到下午五时半，宣传队才陆续回校。
    该校并决定于二十一日举行这次宣传运动的经验总结及全校师生员工庆功大会。

    【又讯】师大二院宣传队一周来深入工厂学校进行宣传，十九日又再到街头。中文系在报子街一带，外文系在太平湖，历史系在皮库胡同，从十二时到五时各系各表演了四场，共计观众约四千五百多人。中文系宣传时，一位老大娘看着地图问“朝鲜在那儿？我们中国在那儿？”同学指着告诉了她以后，她说：“哦！只隔着一条线，我们应该管朝鲜的战事，这话是对的。”
