　　Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: The frantic offensives of the invading U.S. troops and the Syngman Rhee puppet army on all fronts in Korea have begun to suffer setbacks due to the resolute counterattacks of the People's Army. According to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on October 30th: "Well-equipped and resolute, strong Chinese Communist forces remain in organized formations in the western mountains of North Korea. ... It appears that the strength of the Chinese Communist forces remaining in North Korea is much greater than estimated a few days ago." The dispatch stated that on October 30th alone, the People's Army "suddenly produced more tanks and self-propelled guns" and launched "three vigorous counterattacks" against enemy armored and infantry forces in the northwest mountains. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Seoul on October 31st: "The vanguard of the South Korean Sixth Division has retreated 30 miles from the vicinity of Chosan, near the Sino-Korean border. The rest of the Sixth Division has collapsed after three days of bloody fighting." According to Reuters, the ROK troops retreating from Chosan have been "blocked" by the People's Army. Meanwhile, an Associated Press reporter admitted on October 31st that the U.S. 24th Division's 5th Regiment, after encountering staunch resistance, had been "forced to dig 34 miles of trenches." The People's Army's "mortars and small arms have inflicted heavy casualties on the U.S. forces." Another Associated Press dispatch stated that the ROK 8th Division's 16th Regiment, east of Unsan, was attacked by the People's Army and "forced to retreat more than two miles."
　　In the east coast region, the Korean People's Army also launched a resolute counteroffensive. A United Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 31st stated that the People's Army launched a fierce counteroffensive not far northwest of Hamhung, causing the South Korean army to retreat two and a half miles. The dispatch exclaimed that this major industrial center was "increasingly threatened." An Associated Press dispatch from Seoul on the same day also admitted that the situation of the South Korean Third Division in the Hamhung area was "serious."
　　The resolute counterattacks of the Korean People's Army have caused great anxiety to the U.S. aggressors. According to the Kuomintang Central News Agency, MacArthur Headquarters officers are worried that the invading forces of the United States and its satellite states will be "forced to spend a freezing winter in Korea." They mournfully believe that "if the bulk of the UN forces are tied down in Korea for the winter," they will have to "wait until May next year" to continue their dream of "complete occupation of North Korea."

　　朝鲜人民军展开坚强反击
    由楚山溃退的伪军已被拦住去路
    人民军炮火使美军受到严重伤亡
    【新华社二日讯】侵朝美军与李承晚伪军在各战线上的疯狂进犯，已因人民军的坚强反击而开始遭到挫败。据路透社东京十月三十日电称：“装备精良、意志坚决的强大的共军，仍保持有组织的阵形留在北朝鲜西部山里。……看来仍留在北朝鲜的共军的兵力，比几天以前所估计的大得多。”该电文称：在十月三十日一天中，人民军“突然拿出更多的坦克与自动炮”，在西北山地对敌人的装甲兵与步兵“发动了三次有力的反攻”。据美联社汉城十月三十一日讯：“南朝鲜第六师的先头部队，已自中朝边境楚山附近向后撤退了三十英里。第六师的其他部队经过三天的血战后业已溃退。”据路透社称：从楚山溃退的伪军，已被人民军“拦住了去路”。同时，美联社记者于十月三十一日承认：美军第二十四师第五团在遇到坚决抵抗以后，已“被迫挖了三十四英里长的战壕”。人民军的“迫击炮和小型武器曾使美军受到严重的伤亡”。美联社另电称：李承晚伪军第八师第十六团在云山以东遭到人民军的反击，“被迫后退两英里多”。
    在东海岸地区，朝鲜人民军亦展开了坚强的反攻。合众社东京三十一日电称：人民军在咸兴西北不远处展开激烈的反攻，使南朝鲜军后撤了二英里半。该电惊呼这座大工业中心正“日益遭受威胁”。同日美联社汉城电也承认咸兴地区南朝鲜第三师“情势严重”。
    朝鲜人民军的坚强反击，使美国侵略者十分焦虑。据国民党中央社透露：麦克阿瑟总部军官们担心美国及其仆从国的侵略军，将“被迫在韩国过凛冽的冬天”。他们悲哀地认为：“如果大部联合国军被牵制在韩境过冬”，只有“静等明年五月”才能继续做“完全占领北韩”的迷梦。
