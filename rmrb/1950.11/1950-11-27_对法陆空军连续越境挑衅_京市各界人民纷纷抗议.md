　　In Response to Continuous Cross-Border Provocations by French Land and Air Forces
　　People from All Walks of Life in Beijing Protest Vigorously
　　[Our Newspaper] People from all walks of life in Beijing expressed extreme anger at the continuous armed provocations by French land and air forces on the Sino-Vietnamese border and unanimously supported the statement of the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
　　Fighters from the General Team of Correctors of the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government, the Beijing Team of Correctors of the People's Liberation Army, and the anti-aircraft artillery units stationed in Beijing angrily stated: French imperialism dares to be an enemy of the Chinese people. It has already been battered and exhausted in Vietnam. If it dares to come to China to make trouble, we will beat it to a pulp! They unanimously expressed their determination to intensify military training and defend the country.
　　National Model Worker Li Yonglu declared: The atrocities of French imperialism have aroused the righteous indignation of the Chinese working class. Railway workers have decided to carry out the over-axle movement to the end to resolutely protest.
　　The Beijing Coal Mine Trade Union, the Beijing Tram Company, and the employees of the 70th Arsenal launched discussions one after another. The employees believed that French imperialism and American imperialism have always been enemies of the Chinese people. They collude together in an attempt to undermine world peace. The working class must do a good job in production, unite with peace-loving people all over the world, and give the warmongers a head-on blow!
　　The farmers of Guandongdian in the suburbs clearly remembered the tragic history of the Eight-Power Allied Forces bullying Chinese people when they opened a shooting range in Guandongdian. They said angrily: "Whether it is American imperialism or French imperialism, if the wolves come to bite us, we will fight!"
　　The branch of the Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Against American Aggression of the Normal University and the trade union and student union of Fu Jen Catholic University issued protest letters. Faculty and staff of Northern Jiaotong University and Beijing Railway College issued declarations. The chairman of the trade union of Yenching University, the chairman of the student union, and professors from the Normal University delivered speeches, condemning the shameless provocations of French imperialism. They unanimously believed that the bloody acts of aggression by French imperialism are part of the aggressive conspiracy of the imperialist camp headed by American imperialism and are inseparable from the crazy aggression of American imperialism against Korea and our country. They resolutely expressed their determination to heighten vigilance and strike the aggressors at any time. Faculty, staff, and students from the Engineering Institute of North China University, the National Hui Nationality College, the School of Finance and Economics, and Xiyin Middle School also expressed great anger. Students in the third grade of the banking department of the School of Finance and Economics even wrote letters to express their respect to the border defense forces in Guangxi and Yunnan.
