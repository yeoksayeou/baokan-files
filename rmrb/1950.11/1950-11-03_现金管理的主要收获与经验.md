　　Main Gains and Experiences in Cash Management
    Wang Jingran

    I. Brief Overview of Cash Management Implementation

    Since the Government Administration Council issued the order to implement cash management, under the direct leadership of governments at all levels, thanks to the strong support and diligent execution by state-owned enterprises, government agencies, military units, and cooperatives, as well as the active efforts of comrades in the People's Bank of China, significant achievements have been made: a large amount of scattered funds has begun to be organized and concentrated in the bank for unified control and use; the planned and proactive adjustment of currency circulation has been initially achieved, thereby ensuring the balance of cash revenue and expenditure; this is not only an important factor in curbing inflation and stabilizing prices, but also powerfully supplies the capital needs of the recovery of production and construction, and begins to change the general customer relationship between the People's Bank of China and state-owned enterprises into the legal economic division of labor between socialist economic components in the new democratic society.

    The implementation of cash management, a brand-new endeavor, on such a vast scale across the country, is naturally not an easy task. However, after more than half a year of exploration, and with the cooperation of various relevant departments and the search for all possible assistance, the work has developed vigorously.

    According to September data, the institutions of the People's Bank of China handling cash management have accounted for more than 90% of the branches and offices that should be implementing it. According to recent statistics, the number of accounts opened by state-owned enterprises, government agencies, military units, cooperatives, and other relevant departments has reached 88% of the number of units under management. Among them, Shanghai, Beijing, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places have reached 100%. According to the statistics of nine provincial and municipal branches, the proportion of households with prescribed inventory among these account-opening units has averaged 62.3% of the managed households.

    II. Main Achievements Since Cash Management:

    (1) Concentrated huge amounts of funds, curbed inflation, stabilized prices, and supported production. Although the ultimate goal of cash management is not just to absorb deposits, it is an inevitable fact that the People's Bank of China's deposits increase after the implementation of cash management. This not only becomes a powerful factor in curbing inflation in the process of implementing the policy of stabilizing prices, but also provides huge funds to support production after prices have been stabilized. If we take March as 100, the national People's Bank of China's deposits reached 575 in September, an increase of nearly five times in seven months, with the fastest increase in the Southwest and Northwest regions. If these funds are not organized, it will undoubtedly be detrimental to financial stability. After being organized and used for production and construction, it can generate tremendous power. According to statistics, the number of loans from the People's Bank of China in September this year increased more than nine times compared to February this year, which is the best illustration.

    (2) Saved many manpower and material resources for various enterprises and government agencies, promoted the planning of their operations, and strengthened the implementation of economic accounting. 1. Saving manpower for various enterprises and government agencies: For example, Qingdao Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and other eight units saved more than 60 cashier personnel, and estimated at 300,000 yuan per person per month, saving more than 10 million yuan; Southern University in Guangzhou originally kept 700 to 800 million yuan in cash, which required special personnel to guard day and night, but after being deposited in the bank, the heavy burden was relieved. 2. Strengthening planning: For example, a department in Shanghai originally lacked 12 billion yuan in its April plan and needed to borrow money to solve it, but after cash management, it not only did not borrow money, but also deposited 13 billion yuan; the reliability of the income and expenditure plan compiled by the Shanghai Office of Qingdao China Textile Company has reached more than 80%. Some units not only strengthen their own planning after implementing cash management, but also can "serve as a powerful assistant to promote lower-level institutions." In terms of government agencies, Shanghai's financial departments have gradually embarked on the path of planned overall financial revenue and expenditure. Before the implementation of cash management, the Finance Bureau was responsible for supplying funds to various municipal agencies in Shanghai, but the information it had was only the budget and some extremely unsystematic materials. In the past, the allocation of funds was somewhat blind, and financial scheduling often encountered difficulties and had to advance treasury funds. However, since the implementation of cash management, the expenditure of funds by various agencies has been based on the preparation of income and expenditure plans, which has provided the Finance Bureau with extremely valuable materials, allowing the monthly funds to be allocated in installments, reducing the burden on the Finance Bureau caused by centralized allocation. 3. Strengthening economic accounting: For example, the financial situation of a department in Xi'an was always chaotic for more than eight months after liberation. If the income was good, they would buy a lot of materials, and the equipment would be set up and not used. If the income was not good, they would ask the higher authorities for funds; this unreasonable phenomenon has been initially overcome since the implementation of cash management. Therefore, many state-owned enterprises and government agencies are satisfied with cash management. For example, the Chemical Department of Shanghai Import Company automatically introduced many customers to open accounts at the bank.

    (3) Promote transfer accounts to save cash use. All state-owned enterprises are developing vigorously, and it is very inconvenient to move cash back and forth. After cash management, the transfer account system was implemented in a timely manner, which not only solved this difficulty, but also saved cash use. From April to August, according to the materials of eight major city banks, the change in the ratio of transfer accounts to cash receipts and payments of the People's Bank of China increased from 13:1 to 16:1 on average, among which the ratio in Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, and other places was above 30:1 in August. Moreover, due to the widespread implementation of transfer accounts, the general deposit time was extended, and the slowdown of currency circulation after price stabilization, the reserve withdrawal amount of bank deposits was greatly reduced. For example, in Hankou, it was 24.9% of the total deposits in April, and it had dropped to 5.52% in July; in Guangzhou, it was 40.75% in April, and it had dropped to 3.17% in August, and other places have also been greatly reduced. In this way, the bank can more freely use deposits for production.

    III. Several Main Links in Cash Management Work

    (1) Strive to open accounts: The first step in the development of cash management work is to strive for managed units to open accounts. According to local experience, many units had some concerns in the early stages: some were afraid that the bank would "tighten" too much, and it would be inconvenient to withdraw money in the future, some were afraid of affecting business, some were afraid of exposing inventory, and some were even worried about being frozen, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen policy propaganda and patiently explain and persuade. The methods that can be used in this regard are roughly: 1. Explanation through meetings. Many places have held symposiums, at which the needs of the country and the benefits to the unit itself are explained and analyzed in detail, and repeated, which is generally very effective. In some places, many units opened accounts after the meeting. 2. Individual visits. This is mainly carried out by the bank sending people with a spirit of service and self-criticism. When visiting various units, in addition to explaining the general significance of cash management combined with the actual interests of each unit (such as the other party's need for planning, the need to improve the accounting system, etc.), it is more important to point out the problems existing in the bank's past work style and the ways to improve it in the future, which can often achieve the purpose of striving to open accounts. 3. Introduce account opening through account-opening units. Facts have proved that this indirect effect is often greater than the effect of directly sending people to contact, so it can be widely used.

    (2) Cash returns to the bank: Cash management work is one of the three major centers in the national economic construction of the People's Bank of China. There is a lot of work to be done, but at the beginning of the event, there is not only no experience, but also limited manpower, so it can only be carried out with emphasis and step by step, and it cannot be rushed. The most important work after the managed unit opens an account is to require that cash that is not needed for the time being must be deposited in the bank, and then withdrawn when needed. In this regard, many places have grasped it more tightly, so after the implementation of cash management, the deposits of the People's Bank of China have increased sharply.

    (3) Determine the inventory: After the cash has returned to the bank, the third link is to determine the inventory. All relevant units should, in accordance with the three-day retention principle stipulated in the Government Administration Council's order, negotiate with the bank to determine the inventory based on their actual needs. It should be noted here that: the three-day retention limit refers to the maximum amount, not that each unit must retain the full three days. For example: 1. Units with fixed daily cash income can retain less as appropriate; 2. Wages paid on a fixed date do not need to be reserved in advance, and can be withdrawn at that time; 3. Units near the bank can also retain less. However, these can only be used as general appeals. In actual implementation, the self-reported number of each unit is often biased towards more. So how should it be reduced and appropriately determined? This is a very meticulous organizational work that requires patience. Based on local experience, the following methods are quite effective: 1. Both parties negotiate: According to the past inventory and daily expenses, calculate the cash required for each item and find the rules. 2. Hold symposiums, classify the nature of the units, collectively discuss and democratically evaluate. 3. First review and reduce through its leading agency to demonstrate to subordinate agencies. 4. After a trial period, the Financial and Economic Committee can formally approve it and strictly enforce it. It should not exceed the limit unless there are special accidents.

    (4) How to conduct inspections. After the inventory is determined, it is not completely without problems, and inspections must be carried out and adjusted in a timely manner. For example, many places have reduced the originally determined retention amount by 80% to 90% after inspection. After inspection, the enterprises of a certain department in Shanghai generally reduced the limit by up to 98% at most and at least one-fifth; according to the statistics of 1,028 units in Hankou in August, the self-reported inventory was about 7.4 billion yuan, which was reduced to about 5.2 billion yuan after review, and finally negotiated to 2 billion yuan. Among them, a department originally planned to retain 50 billion yuan, then self-reported 30 billion yuan, but after the responsible comrades of the bank went to negotiate in person, it was reduced to 5 billion yuan, and then contacted to reduce it to 1 billion yuan, and finally reduced to 100 million yuan. This shows that it is extremely necessary to conduct inspections in a timely manner after the cash management is deployed. But how to organize the inspection? According to Shanghai's experience: 1. First of all, a inspection plan must be drawn up, the inspection content must be studied, and forms must be formulated, and then different requirements must be put forward according to the specific circumstances of each unit. 2. Carefully select inspectors, whose conditions are: (a) Have a higher political understanding and common sense of the other party's business; (b) Be familiar with the business and internal processing procedures of this industry; (c) Have basic accounting knowledge and experience; (d) Be capable, humble, and upright. 3. If the inspection can be accompanied by someone sent by its direct superior agency, the work will be more favorable. 4. Before the inspectors conduct the inspection, it is best to have a general understanding of the work nature, income and expenditure plan, and its implementation of the inspected unit, so as to "have a good understanding." In the process of work, unnecessary troubles should be avoided as much as possible, and no big words should be used to scare people, such as "Government Administration Council's order" and "financial and economic discipline," etc.

    (5) Require the managed units to prepare income and expenditure plans and conduct income and expenditure according to the plans. Only in this way can the bank regulate cash circulation in a planned way and gradually become the center of settlement. For the units themselves, only through the preparation and review of income and expenditure plans can they gradually strengthen economic accounting. Of course, before the government clearly orders the realization of the People's Bank of China to become a settlement and credit center, it is inevitably difficult to achieve perfection and accuracy in the compiled income and expenditure plans, but in the process of cash management work, preparations should be made as early as possible, and trials should be conducted in several units with frequent transactions. Otherwise, the part of the foundation that has already returned cash to the bank is not solid. Several principles for preparing income and expenditure plans should be: 1. In terms of time, it is enough to distinguish between annual (quarterly) and quarterly (monthly), and there is no need to prepare a monthly plan separately; 2. Cash and transfer accounts should be distinguished in order to facilitate the People's Bank of China to prepare the national cash plan; 3. Local enterprises focus on the review of financial and economic committees at all levels, and central enterprises focus on the review of various central ministries, but the final approval right should belong to the central government.

    (6) The bank prepares a cash plan (or a comprehensive income and expenditure plan, hereinafter the same): The banks at all levels, based on the income and expenditure plans compiled by the managed state-owned enterprises (including central and local enterprises), government agencies, military units, and cooperatives, add their own income and expenditure plans for private, public-private joint ventures, and groups, and can prepare the cash plan for each place and submit it to the head office for summary. This cash plan is the main reference material for managing currency, so it is an extremely prudent task and cannot be taken lightly. The time division and reporting procedures should be the same as the income and expenditure plans compiled by the managed units.

    IV. Several Main Experiences

    (1) Administrative management must be combined with enhancing the spirit of service. Cash management is a legal provision of the government, and of course it must be actively participated in and strictly observed, but in today's situation where various tasks are not yet fully standardized and the majority of workers are basically still exploring business, if you simply take out the law and apply it upwards, and then sit and wait for results to come, it is obviously not feasible. Therefore, when carrying out the work, it must be combined with the actual interests of the managed units, enhance their own service, and try to take care of their actual needs as much as possible without violating the principles. From the bank itself, for more than half a year, various places have indeed proposed various methods and actively promoted them. Such as launching various movements to improve work efficiency, trying out the special counter responsibility system, fixed personnel and quota system, establishing mobile (or patrol) service teams, simplifying accounting and cashier procedures, adopting holiday duty system, extending daily office hours, and telephone appointments to withdraw funds, etc. And it has achieved significant results and widespread praise. But is that enough? Still not enough, because the objective environment still requires bank workers to assist the managed agencies in researching and improving accounting procedures, compiling financial plans, etc. with a spirit of service, which is very necessary for the promotion of cash management and the strengthening of economic accounting.

    (2) Clarify the purpose of cash management. Some comrades think that cash management is to strive for deposits, and that completing the deposit task is completing cash management; some also simply propose that cash management is a means of absorbing deposits, so some places have the phenomenon of relaxing cash management after exceeding the deposit task. In fact, this is wrong. When the request for cash management was put forward in the past, because the currency was still inflating and prices were still rising, it was necessary to strive for deposits and fully organize currency withdrawal. Cash management assisted in completing this task, but did not achieve its true goal. According to Soviet experience, the overall goal of the so-called three major "centers," including cash management, is to regulate cash circulation in a planned way, save cash use, and concentrate funds to meet the needs of national economic construction. Therefore, the completion of the deposit task is only the first step in laying the foundation for the work, and it is still far from the required requirements.

    (3) Implement it step by step, in a planned way, and with emphasis: Cash management work is extremely extensive. From the bank's point of view, it needs to quickly get out of the previous narrow circle and establish contact with a large number of state-owned enterprises, government agencies, military units, and cooperatives. Therefore, after receiving the task, all places should generally make full preparations. A detailed plan and steps were set to gradually promote it. For example, Tianjin has divided cash management households into five batches: the first batch is state-owned industrial departments, the second batch is municipal-level trade departments and municipal-level cooperatives, the third batch is all municipal-level agencies and production departments in the city, the fourth batch is municipal-level and above agencies (public) schools, groups, and troops in Tianjin, and the fifth batch is foreign purchasing agencies stationed in Tianjin. Shanghai divides public enterprises into three categories based on their location: the first category is the units of this enterprise in Shanghai, the second category is the units of this enterprise in other places but with a fixed office in Shanghai, and the third category is the units of this enterprise in other places but with only mobile representatives in Shanghai. Based on this, they respectively focus on the first two types to strive to promote all cash management work, and focus on the latter type to open accounts, check cash, and determine inventory limits, and other temporary relief. According to their specific conditions, agencies and troops are also divided into six categories, and key units are selected for management in a planned and step-by-step manner. These experiences are quite commendable.

    (4) Grasping the head departments and thus mastering their subordinate institutions is a shortcut to promoting work.

    This is mainly reflected in the units within the same urban area. The method is to organize their leading agencies into the cash management leading organization to jointly promote it. For example, since the promulgation of the cash management method, the Tianjin Municipal Bureau of Industry has established an enterprise treasury in this bank. The sales revenue of more than 20 factories must be sent to the bank on the same day, and the funds are allocated according to the plan when needed. The income and expenditure plan of the affiliated system is sent by the bureau on a monthly basis, which is completely unified with its financial plan, and the bureau's income and expenditure is based on this. The cash retention plan of each factory is reviewed by the bank and the bureau, and all three parties have records. Each factory must report the actual inventory to the Bureau of Industry every day. If there is any excess or the inventory is not sent to the bank on the same day, criticisms will be made. The bank will also send people to each factory for on-site inspection. As a result, it has played a great role in urging cash to return to the bank, and the Bureau of Industry also believes that cash management has accelerated the realization of the planned financial income and expenditure that they have long wanted to handle. Before management, due to the backlog of funds in various factories, the bureau owed the bank more than 8 billion yuan. After management, in addition to repaying the debt, there is often a deposit of about 10 billion yuan. The East China Industrial Department, the Logistics Headquarters of the East China Military Region, and the Xinhua Bookstores in various provinces in East China have all solved major problems with similar methods.

　　现金管理的主要收获与经验
    王静然
    一、现金管理实施以来简况
    自政务院命令实施现金管理以来，在各级政府直接领导下，由于得到国家企业、机关、部队及合作社的大力支持认真执行和国家银行工作同志们的积极努力，业已收到显著成绩：大量分散资金开始被组织起来，集中银行而加以统一掌握运用；初步作到有计划的主动的调剂货币流通，从而保证了现金收支平衡；这不仅是制止通货膨胀稳定物价的重要因素之一，同时也有力的供应了恢复生产建设中的资金需要，并将国家银行与国家企业业务之间的一般主顾关系开始改变为新民主主义社会中社会主义经济成份间法定的经济分工。
    现金管理这一崭新工作在全国偌大范围内推行，自然不是一件容易的事情，但经过半年多的摸索，配合各有关部门，找寻了各种可能的帮助，工作却是生气勃勃的发展了起来。
    国家银行办理现金管理的机构，根据九月份材料，已占应推行行处百分之九十以上。国家企业，机关部队及合作社等有关部门向银行开户数字，根据最近统计，已达应管户数的百分之八十八。内中上海、北京、汉口、广州等地，且已达百分之一百。在这些开户单位中，已规定库存的户数占已管户数的比例，按九个省市分行统计，平均已占到百分之六二·三。
    二、现金管理以来的主要收获：
    （一）集中了巨量资金，制止了通货膨胀，稳定了物价，扶助了生产。现金管理的最后目的，虽然不只是为了吸收存款，但一经实行现金管理之后，国家银行存款增加却是必然的事实。这样就不仅在执行稳定物价政策过程中成为制止通货膨胀的有力因素之一，而且到物价既经稳定之后，更可提供巨大资金，以扶助生产。全国国家银行的存款，若以三月份为一○○，九月份即达五七五，七个月中增加近五倍，内中尤以西南区、西北区增加最速。这些资金如不被组织起来，无疑将不利于金融的稳定。组织起来以后，用之于生产建设，就可以发生巨大的力量。据统计，国家银行今年九月份的贷款数字较之今年二月份增加九倍以上，就是一个最好的说明。
    （二）节省了各企业、机关许多人力物力，并促进其经营的计划性，加强了经济核算制的推行。１、各企业机关节省人力方面：如青岛花纱布公司等八个单位即省去出纳人员六十余人，每人每月以三十万元开支估计，即省去一千余万元；广州南方大学，原自行保管现金七、八亿元，须派专人日夜看守，经联系存入银行后重负顿释。２、计划性加强方面：如上海某部门，在四月份计划中原缺头寸一百二十亿，须要借款解决，现金管理后不但没有借款，反而存款一百三十亿；青岛中纺公司驻沪办事处所编收支计划的可靠性已达八成以上。有些单位实行现管以后，不仅本身计划性加强，且可“作为推动下级机构的得力助手”。表现在机关方面，如上海财政部门对于全盘财政收支业已逐渐走上计划化。现管实行以前，财政局负责供给上海市属各机关经费，但掌握的资料只有预算和一些极不系统的材料，以往拨发经费有些盲目性，财政调度经常发生困难，而必须预支库款，但自实行现管后，各机关经费支出，按编制收支计划，因此提供了财政局极有价值的材料，使一月的款项，可分次拨发，减轻了集中拨款所加于财政之负担。３、加强经济核算方面：如西安某部门解放后八个多月财务状况始终紊乱，收入好即买很多材料，装置品摆起来用不着，收入不好，就请上级拨款；此种不合理现象，自实行现管后，即得到初步克服。因此许多国家企业、机关对现管都感到满意。如上海进口公司化工部即自动介绍许多客户到银行开户。
    （三）推行转帐节约现金使用。所有国家企业业务都在蒸蒸日上的发展，现金往返搬动，是大感不便的。现金管理以后，及时推行了转帐制度，既解决了这种困难，又节约了现金使用。自四月至八月根据八个主要城市行的材料，国家银行转帐与现金收付比例的变化，平均由一三比一增为一六比一，内中上海、天津、重庆等地八月份的比例都在三○比一以上。且因转帐的广泛推行，一般存款时间延长，再加上物价稳定后货币流通速度的减缓，银行存款的备提额乃大大的降低。如汉口四月份是总存款的百分之二四·九，七月份即已降至百分之五·五二；广州四月份是百分之四○·七五，八月份已降至百分之三·一七，其他各地亦均大为减少。这样，银行就可以将存款更加放手地用到生产事业上去。
    三、现金管理工作中的几个主要环节
    （一）争取开户：现金管理工作的展开，第一步就是争取受管单位开户。根据各地经验，不少单位在初期多少都有些顾虑：有的害怕银行“卡”得紧了，以后取用不方便，有的怕影响业务，有的怕暴露库存，有的甚至还耽心万一被冻结等等。因此必须加强政策宣传，耐心解释说服。在这方面可采用的方式，大致为：１、通过会议解释。许多地方都开了座谈会，在座谈会上从国家的需要到单位自身的好处，详加解释分析，而且反复进行，一般都很有效力。有的地方开完会之后，便有许多单位开户。２、个别访问。这主要由银行派人以服务与自我检讨精神去进行。到各单位后，除就现管一般意义结合各单位实际利益（如对方需要计划，需要健全会计制度等）加以说明外，更须着重指出过去银行作风上存在的问题与今后改善的办法，这样往往可以达到争取开户的目的。３、通过开户单位介绍开户，事实证明这种间接作用，往往比直接派人去联系的作用还要大，因此可以广泛采用。
    （二）现金归行：现金管理工作是国家银行在整个国民经济建设中成为三大中心的环节之一，要做的工作很多，但在举办之初，不仅经验毫无，而且人力有限，所以只能有重点有步骤的进行，不可求之过急。受管单位开户后最重要的工作，即要求其一时用不着的现金，统须送存银行，待需用时再支取。在这一点上，许多地方都掌握的较紧，因此现金管理付诸实施以后，国家银行的存款便急遽地增加起来。
    （三）确定库存：现金既已归行，第三个环节工作就是确定库存。各有关单位应按照政务院命令所定三日留存原则，根据其实际需要情况，与银行商定库存。这里需要说明的是：三日留存的限度是指最高额，并不是各个单位都非留足三日不可。例如：１、每日固定有现金收入的单位，即可酌量少留；２、固定日期发付的工薪，可不必预留，届时再支取；３、临近银行的单位，亦可少留。但这些只能作为一般的号召，在实际执行时，各单位的自报数往往是偏多的，那么究应如何予以减低，适当加以确定呢？这是一件很细致的须要耐心的组织工作。综合各地经验，以下几个办法是颇有效的：１、双方商洽：根据过去库存及日常开支情况，将各项目需要之现金，加以计算，找出规律。２、分别单位性质，举行座谈会，集体讨论，民主评定。３、通过其领导机关，首先核减，以示范于下属机关。４、试行一定时间后，通过财委正式核定，即可严格执行，非遇特殊意外，不应超过限额。
    （四）如何进行检查，库存确定后，也不是就完全没有问题了，还得进行检查，及时加以调整。如许多地方经检查后，都核减原定留用额的百分之八十至九十。上海某部各企业经检查后，普遍减少限额最多达百分之九八，最少亦达五分之一；汉口八月份一○二八个单位统计，自报库存数七十四亿左右，经核减后为五十二亿许，最后洽定为二十亿，内中有一个部门原拟保留五百亿，后自报为三百亿，经银行负责同志亲往洽商后，减到五十亿，再与联系便减到五亿，最后减到一亿。这说明现金管理布置以后，及时进行检查工作是极其需要的。但怎样组织检查呢？根据上海经验：１、首先要订出检查计划，研究检查内容并制定表格，然后再根据各个单位的具体情况，提出不同的要求。２、慎选检查人员，其条件为：（甲）具有较高政治认识与对方业务的常识；（乙）熟悉本行业务及内部处理手续；（丙）具有基本会计知识和经验；（丁）为人精干，态度谦和，作风正派。３、检查时如能由其直属上级机构派人陪同前往，工作进行将更为有利。４、检查人员进行检查之先，最好对被检查单位的工作性质、收支计划及其执行情况，有概括的了解，作到“胸中有数”。在工作进行中，应尽量避免不必要麻烦，更不要大话吓人，如“政务院命令”、“财经纪律”等等。
    （五）要求受管单位编制收支计划并按计划进行收支，只有这样，银行才能有计划地调节现金流通、逐步成为结算的中心。就各单位本身来说，也只有通过收支计划的编制审订，才可以渐次加强经济核算。当然在政府未明令公布实现国家银行成为结算信贷中心前，所编收支计划必然难求完备与准确，但在现金管理工作进行中，应早作准备，在若干交易频繁单位先行试办，不如此则已有现金归行的部分基础，也是不巩固的。编制收支计划的几项原则，似应是：１、时间上说分出年度（分季）季度（分月）的就够了，不必单编每月的计划；２、应分清现金与转帐，以便国家银行编制全国出纳计划；３、地方企业集中各级财委审核，中央企业集中中央各部审核，但最后核定权应属中央。
    （六）银行编制出纳计划（或叫综合收支计划，下同）：各级银行根据受管的国家企业（包括中央与地方企业）机关、部队、合作社所编的收支计划，加入其本身所编对私营、公私合营及团体等的收支计划，即可编制各地出纳计划，交由总行汇总。这个出纳计划，是管理通货的主要参考资料，因此是一件极其慎重的工作，不能稍为马虎。其时间划分及上报程序，应与各受管单位所编收支计划同。
    四、几点主要经验
    （一）行政管理必须与增强服务精神相结合。现金管理是政府的法令规定，当然必须积极参加、严格遵守，但处在今天各种工作尚未十分正规化、广大工作人员对业务基本上还在摸索阶段的情况下，如果只是简单地拿出法令，往上一套，即坐等成绩到来，显然是不行的。因此在进行工作之时，必须与受管单位的实际利益相结合，增强自己的服务性，在不违犯原则的前提下应尽量照顾其实际需要。从银行本身来说，半年多以来，各地确也曾提出了种种办法，积极推行。如发动各种提高工作效率运动、试行专柜负责制、定员定额制、建立流动（或巡回）服务组、简化会计出纳手续、采取假日值班制、延长每日办公时间以及电话约定往取款项等等。且已获得显著的成绩与普遍的赞许。但这样就够了吗？仍不够的，因为客观环境还须要银行工作者以服务的精神，协助受管机关研究并改善会计程序、编订财务计划等等，这对于现管工作的推行与经济核算的加强，都是很必要的。
    （二）明确现金管理的目的。有的同志说认为现管是为了争取存款，认为完成了存款任务，就是完成了现金管理；有的还简单的提出现管是吸收存款的手段，于是有些地方就产生了超过存款任务即放松现管的现象。实际上这是不对的。过去提出现管要求的时候，因为通货还在膨胀，物价还在上涨，所以必须争取存款全力组织通货回笼。现管工作协助完成了此一任务，但并未达成其真正目标。根据苏联经验，包括现管在内的所谓三大“中心”的总目标，是有计划地调节现金流通、节约现金使用与集中资金以供国民经济建设之需。因此存款任务的完成，才不过第一步打下工作的基础，与应有的要求，还相距很远。
    （三）有步骤、有计划、有重点的实施：现金管理工作，范围极其广泛。从银行来说，它需要迅速走出以往狭小的圈子与广大的国家企业、机关、部队及合作社等发生连系。因此各地接到任务后，一般都应作充分准备工作。定出了详确的计划与步骤，逐步推行。如天津曾将现管户分成五批：第一批为国营工业部门，第二批为市级贸易部门及市级合作社，第三批为市内外之一切机关生产部门，第四批为在津市级以上机关（公立）学校、团体、部队，第五批为外来驻津采购机关。上海对公营企业，按照其所在地为标准，则分作三类：第一类为本企业在上海市的单位，第二类为本企业在外埠、而上海设有固定办事处的单位，第三类为本企业在外埠、而上海仅有流动性代表的单位。基于此，他们便分别重点，对前二类争取推行全部现管工作，对后一类则着重于开户、检查现金及确定库存限额，其他暂时从缓。对机关部队，亦根据其具体情况条件分作六类，有重点有步骤的择其重点单位，进行管理。这些经验都是颇可取法的。
    （四）抓住首脑部门，从而掌握其下属机构，这是推进工作的一条捷径。
    这主要表现在同一市区范围以内的各单位。其方法是把他们的领导机关组织到现管领导组织中来，共同推动。如天津市工业局自现管办法颁布后，即在本行建立企业金库，二十多个厂的销货收入限当天送入银行，用款时按计划拨付，所属系统的收支计划，由该局每月汇送，与其财务计划完全统一，该局的收支即以此为依据。各厂留用现金计划，经银行与该局审核，三方都有存案，各厂每日都必须将实际库存报工业局，如有超出或库存当日未送银行，即提出批评，银行也另派人至每一工厂实地检查。这样的结果，在督促现金归行方面起了很大的作用，而工业局也认为现金管理加速了他们久想办理的财务收支计划化的实现。在未管之前，由于各厂积压资金，该局欠银行八十余亿，既管之后，除还欠之外，经常有一百亿左右的存款。华东工业部、华东军区后勤司令部及华东各省的新华书店等部门都以此类似的办法，解决了很大的问题。
