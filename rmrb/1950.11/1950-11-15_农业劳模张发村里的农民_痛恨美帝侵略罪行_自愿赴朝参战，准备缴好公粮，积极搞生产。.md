Farmers in Agricultural Model Worker Zhang Fa's Village
Hateful of American Imperialist Aggression
Voluntarily Enlist to Fight in Korea, Prepare to Hand in Public Grain, and Actively Engage in Production.
[Reported by this newspaper] This newspaper's correspondent and representative to the National Congress of Labor Model Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, Zhang Fa, reports: All the farmers in Jiangjiawopu Village, Jianguo Village, Sixth District, Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, recently held a current affairs forum. At the meeting, Zhang Fa first explained in detail to the masses the crimes of the American imperialists' frantic expansion of the war of aggression, burning the flames of war to our borders, and bombing our territory several times, injuring our compatriots. At that time, it aroused the masses' unparalleled hatred, and they unanimously shouted the roar of never being slaves of a subjugated country for the second time. Zhong Haikun said: "I must go to carry stretchers to help the Korean people fight against American imperialism." Old Wang, who is over fifty years old, used to be more stubborn, but this time at the meeting, he voluntarily offered to take out a horse to help the Korean people resist American imperialism. He said, "If the American imperialists come to attack, isn't the horse still the landlord's?" Originally, his son disagreed, and Old Wang was very angry, saying, "I must take a horse, even if it's for my old age! If the horse doesn't come back, then consider it buying me a coffin!" Then, Gao Yousheng burst into tears and slammed the table, gritting his teeth and saying, "Damn his ancestors, the whole village was flooded for three years, and we were just about to have a good life this year, and the American devils are here to mess things up again! I must use my bones to fight him." Wang Diansheng wanted to carry a stretcher, but because he had just recovered from an illness, everyone didn't allow him to go. He thumped his chest and said, "Is it not enough for me, a young man!? What's the point of being over five feet tall if I can't do anything!?" The woman Nie Shuzhen hated the American imperialists so much that she said, "Although I am a woman, if I am allowed to go to Korea, I can also kill a few American devils and avenge the Korean women who are suffering." At the meeting, the masses enthusiastically competed to contribute people, horses, and carts, and unanimously stated: We are willing to give whatever is needed and contribute the strength of the whole village to fight against American imperialism.

In order to do a good job in preparing for war and to improve production, most of the village's crops have been harvested. Currently, out of the twenty-two groups in the village, thirteen groups have completed threshing. The masses said: We must not only thresh quickly and cleanly, without losing a single grain, but also be vigilant and do a good job in maintaining law and order. The groups that have finished threshing have already started sideline production. They have gathered a lot of firewood and ula grass. Fishing and hunting have also begun. The women in the village are mobilizing to select good public grain and make stretcher clothes. Many people are voluntarily giving shoes and towels to the Korean People's Army to express their respect.

　　农业劳模张发村里的农民
　　痛恨美帝侵略罪行
    自愿赴朝参战，准备缴好公粮，积极搞生产。
    【本报讯】本报通讯员、出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表大会的代表张发报道：黑龙江省肇源县第六区建国村姜家窝铺屯全体农民日前召开了时事座谈会。会上，张发首先把美帝疯狂扩大侵略战争，将战火烧向我国边疆及几次轰炸我国领土、炸伤我们同胞的罪行，详细地向群众做了解释。当时就激起了群众的无比痛恨，一致喊出决不当第二次亡国奴的吼声。钟海坤说：“我一定要去抬担架，帮助朝鲜人民打击美帝。”五十多岁的老王头，过去比较固执，这次在会上，自动要拿出一匹马去帮助朝鲜人民反抗美帝。他说：“美帝要打来，马还不是地主的吗？”原先他儿子不同意，老王头很生气，说：“一定要拿去一匹马，就算给我打养老啦！如果马回不来，就算给我买棺材啦！”接着，高有声泪俱下地咬着牙一拍桌子说：“×他祖宗的，全村被水淹三年，今年刚要过好日子，美国鬼子就又来捣蛋！我一定要拿出我这身骨头来和他干一下。”王殿生要去抬担架，因他有病刚好，大家不允许他去。他擂着胸膛说：“就凭我这年青小伙子不行！？五尺多高干啥还不顶一个！？”妇女聂淑珍对美帝恨得了不得，她说：“虽然我是妇女，如果准许我到朝鲜去，我也能打死几个美国鬼子，为朝鲜受罪的妇女报仇。”会上，群众都踊跃地争着去人、去马、去车，并一致表示：用啥给啥，愿意拿出全村的力量来打击美帝。
    全村为了把备战工作作好，把生产提高一步，全村庄稼已大部收拾完了。现全村二十二个组，已有十三个组全部打完了场。群众说：我们不但要打场打的快，打的干净，不损失一粒粮食，还要提高警惕，作好治安工作。现在打完场的小组已经开始了副业生产。打了很多柴禾及乌拉草。打鱼、打猎的也都开始了。全村妇女正动员起来挑好公粮和做担架衣服，很多人并自动拿鞋、手巾送给朝鲜人民军表示敬意。
