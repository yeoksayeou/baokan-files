　　The above map is an illustration from an article published in the American magazine "Collier's" on September 16th of this year, advocating for a world war of aggression. The author of the article is Brigadier General Fellers (currently assistant to the chairman of the Republican National Committee), former "psychological warfare" officer of MacArthur's headquarters. According to the magazine, he "received a citation from MacArthur for his skill in commanding 'psychological warfare.'" He used to be MacArthur's confidant and is now an assistant to Republican policymakers. Therefore, the intentions he reveals are clearly the intentions of the American warmongers. In the article, he blatantly pointed out the offensive routes for the United States to launch a world war of aggression. As shown in the figure, in the East, the Aleutian Islands would be used to attack the Soviet Union (the northernmost arrow), Japan would be used to attack mainland China via Korea, Iwo Jima, and the Chinese territory of Taiwan (the three arrows in the middle), and the Philippines would be used to attack Vietnam (the southernmost arrow). In the West, Spain and Libya in Africa would be used to attack Europe (the two arrows on the west side). Fellers believed that due to insufficient manpower, long supply lines, unreliable "allies," and the strength of the Soviet Union, Europe would quickly "fall" after the United States launched the war, so the Pyrenees Mountains could only be used as a "natural barrier." At the same time, he delusionally believed that "superior air power" and "propaganda warfare" could ensure victory in the war of aggression to conquer the world. This arrogant conspiracy of American imperialism must be shattered by the powerful force of the camp of peace and democracy.

### 美国发动世界性侵略战争的狂妄计划

　　美国发动世界性侵略战争的狂妄计划
    上面的地图是美国今年九月十六日出版的“柯里尔”杂志所登载的一篇鼓动进行世界性侵略的文章的插图。文章的作者是麦克阿瑟总部前任的“心理作战”官员费勒斯准将（现任共和党全国委员会主席助理）。据该刊介绍，说他“曾因善于指挥‘心理作战’而得过麦克阿瑟的奖状”。他以前是麦魔的心腹，现在是共和党决策人的帮手，因此他所表露的意图显然就是美国战争贩子们的意图。他在文章中明目张胆指出美国发动世界性侵略战争的进攻路线，如图所示的，在东方以阿留申群岛进攻苏联（最北的一个箭头），从日本经朝鲜、硫磺岛以及中国领土的台湾进攻中国大陆（中间的三个箭头），从菲律宾进攻越南（最南的一个箭头）；在西方，以西班牙及非洲的利比亚进攻欧洲（西面的两个箭头）。因为费勒斯认为，由于人力不足，补给线太长，“同盟国”不可靠，加上苏联力量的强大，在美帝发动战争后，欧洲将会很快就“沦陷”，因此只能以比利牛斯山作为“天然屏障”。同时他妄想以“优势的空军”和“宣传战”就可以使征服世界的侵略战争得胜。美国帝国主义这种狂妄的阴谋一定要被和平民主阵营的强大力量所粉碎的。
