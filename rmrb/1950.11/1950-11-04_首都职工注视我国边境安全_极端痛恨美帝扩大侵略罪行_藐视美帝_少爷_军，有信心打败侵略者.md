Capital Workers Focus on China's Border Security
Utterly Hate U.S. Imperialism's Expanded Aggression Crimes
Despise U.S. Imperialism's "Young Master" Army, Confident in Defeating the Invaders

[This newspaper dispatch] The workers of various factories in the capital are paying close attention to the American army invading Korea and threatening our country's security, unanimously shouting the righteous slogans "Resolutely oppose U.S. imperialist aggression" and "Support the Korean people."

Discuss Current Events to Recognize the Face of U.S. Imperialist Aggression
Intensify Production to Enhance the Strength to Defend the Motherland

The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant held a current affairs discussion meeting on October 20. All the workers of the plant unanimously expressed: We are determined to oppose the U.S. imperialist aggression with practical actions to eliminate accidents. Since October 20, the plant's employees have been studying current affairs for two hours every day. The workers are very concerned about the development of the current situation. Some workers who have things to do during the day even rush to participate at night. During the discussion, Li Jinquan, a model worker who attended the National Model Worker, Peasant and Soldier Representatives Conference, said: "U.S. imperialism has repeatedly come to disturb and antagonize the Chinese people. The Chinese people love peace, but are definitely not afraid to resist U.S. imperialist aggression. We, the working class, are determined to intensify production, support the People's Liberation Army, and defeat the invaders." The workers are confident in defeating U.S. imperialist aggression and extremely despise the self-proclaimed U.S. imperialists and their "Young Master" army. Zhang Shangbin, a staff member of the accounting section of the plant, said: "We have strong confidence in overthrowing imperialism." On the 23rd, the 70th Arsenal held a current affairs symposium for model worker representatives, learning models, and trade union members, and carefully studied the statement of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson. Everyone unanimously pointed out: The purpose of U.S. imperialism's expansion of the aggressive war is to further invade China. In his speech, Fu Wanyu said: "U.S. imperialism has the same ambition as the Japanese devils, attempting to first occupy Korea, then invade our Northeast, and then destroy China. We should help the Korean people smash the U.S. imperialist conspiracy." Wang Xiaoyi said: "In order to defend peace and support the Korean people, we must come out to stop U.S. imperialist aggression." Everyone also believes that workers in the arsenal should actively prepare and intensify production. More than 1,000 employees of the Tram Company have successively expressed their protests against the U.S. imperialist expansion of the aggressive war and the continuous violation of our airspace. Lu Yuntai, a model worker who invented the resistance water baffle of the plant, proposed: "U.S. imperialism is invading our brother country Korea, and we must support the Korean people in resisting aggression." The company's third employee representative meeting held on October 31 unanimously passed a letter to Chairman Mao and a letter to General Kim Il-sung, expressing their determination to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea with practical actions to further develop production competitions. In their letter to Chairman Mao, they said: "The flames of U.S. imperialist aggressive war have already burned to the doorstep of our motherland. They are afraid of our new China's peaceful construction and want to destroy our democratic and stable life. This is a wild beast coming down the mountain to eat people, and we cannot ignore it!" "We must drive out the wild beasts and kill the wild beasts!" Then, the representatives successively put forward specific competition slogans. The car and road workers proposed to create a new record of one million kilometers of safe driving within the year, the power plant guaranteed to save coal and electricity and safely deliver power, the overhead line department guaranteed power supply without accidents, and the repair shop guaranteed to establish a minor repair system to improve quality. The employees of the first sewing department, tailoring department, and consumer cooperative of the Beijing Clothing Factory unanimously shouted the righteous slogan of "Blood debts must be repaid with blood" for the crimes of U.S. planes repeatedly violating our airspace and killing and wounding our people. The above three units have also held current affairs symposiums.

Cherish Victory and Cherish Peaceful Life
We Must Not Ignore U.S. Imperialist Aggression

Qi Jieshan, a worker at the Beijing Public Bus Company, wrote to Chairman Mao and said: "Under your wise leadership, the Chinese people have been liberated; one year of peaceful construction has progressed rapidly. However, the dying U.S. imperialism is doing everything possible to undermine our peaceful construction. Now U.S. imperialism is brutally invading Korea and bombing our Northeast cities and peaceful residents; obviously, it is attempting to invade the entire Asia. For the safety of Asia and the construction of our motherland, we cannot ignore the repeated acts of aggression by U.S. imperialism. "Workers at the Beijing Machine General Factory compared their lives today with those of the past, and cherished the victory of the Chinese people today, and hated the aggressive war launched by U.S. imperialism in Korea and the provocative acts against the Chinese people even more. The machine workshop group said in a current affairs discussion: U.S. imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, and wants to follow the old path of Japan to violate our motherland's territory. It wants to turn our China into its colony and make us live the days of eating "mixed noodles" again. Some workers said: We have only turned over for more than a year, and U.S. imperialism wants to interfere. The employees of the fitter workshop unanimously requested the leadership to allow them to work overtime to complete the production tasks ahead of schedule and support the Korean people. The employees of the new factory preparatory office and the management and finance departments of the Qinghe Woolen Mill specially discussed the issue of U.S. imperialism occupying our Taiwan and invading Korea on the 24th, 25th, and 26th of October for three days. Their unanimous conclusion is that just as the people of the world are doing their best to defend world peace, U.S. imperialism has tried everything possible to undermine world peace and vainly attempt to expand the aggressive war. It launched an aggressive war in Asia, armed and occupied our Taiwan, and recently intensified its bombing of our Northeast, leading the flames of aggressive war to our motherland's border. The Chinese people must no longer sit idly by in the face of this series of acts of aggression. They warned U.S. imperialism: It should immediately withdraw its troops that invaded Taiwan and Korea, otherwise the Chinese people will never tolerate it. Workers at the Fifties Publishing House and Jingwei, Yuhua Xing, Daxin and other factories also expressed their sympathy for the Korean people and their hatred for U.S. imperialism. Huang Jinchi, the production mutual aid group leader of the Yuhua Xing Factory, was angered when he saw the atrocities of the U.S. military in Korea in the newspaper a few days ago: "This is more ferocious and cruel than the Japanese devils!" That day, he led his production group to discuss current affairs and put forward the slogan: We must do a good job in the production competition, and our hard work is to help fight Taiwan, support the Korean people, and oppose U.S. imperialism!" Now his production group is playing a model role in the factory's production competition.

　　首都职工注视我国边境安全
    极端痛恨美帝扩大侵略罪行
    藐视美帝“少爷”军，有信心打败侵略者
    【本报讯】首都各厂工人们注视侵朝美军威胁我国安全，齐声喊出了“坚决反对美帝侵略”、“支援朝鲜人民”的正义呼声。
    讨论时事认清美帝侵略面目
    加紧生产增强保卫祖国实力
    石景山钢铁厂十月二十日召开了时事讨论会。该厂全体工友一致表示：决以消灭事故的实际行动，来反对美帝侵略暴行。该厂职工自十月二十日起每日学习时事二小时。工人们非常关心目前时局的发展。有的工人白天有事请假，晚上还赶来参加。在讨论中，出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议的劳模李金泉说：“美帝国主义三番五次的来扰乱，敌视中国人民。中国人民是爱好和平的，但绝不怕反抗美帝侵略。我们工人阶级决加紧生产，支援解放军，打垮侵略者。”职工们有信心打败美帝侵略，极端藐视自吹自擂的美帝国主义者和它的“少爷”军队。该厂会计课职贞张尚宾说：“打倒帝国主义我们有着坚强的信心。”七十兵工厂于二十三日召开劳模代表、学习模范及工会委员时事座谈会，详细研究了我外交部发言人的声明。大家一致指出：美帝扩大侵略战争的目的，即在进一步侵略中国。在发言中，傅万煜说：“美帝和日寇的野心一样，企图先侵占朝鲜，再侵占我东北，然后灭亡中国。咱们应该帮助朝鲜人民粉碎美帝阴谋。”王孝宜说：“为了保卫和平，为了支援朝鲜人民，我们不能不出来制止美帝侵略。”大家并认为：兵工厂工人，更应积极准备，加紧生产。电车公司一千多名职工纷纷发表了对于美帝扩大侵略战争、不断犯我领空的抗议。该厂发明阻力挡水板的劳模卢运泰提出：“美帝侵略我们的兄弟国家朝鲜，我们不能不支援朝鲜人民反抗侵略。”该公司十月三十一日举行的第三次职工代表会议，一致通过上书毛主席和致函金日成将军，表示决以进一步开展生产竞赛的实际行动抗美援朝。他们在给毛主席的信上说：“美帝侵略战争的火焰已经烧到我们祖国的门口，他们害怕我们新中国和平建设；想来破坏我们的民主安定的生活。这是野兽下山要吃人，我们不能不管！”“我们一定要驱逐野兽，打死野兽！”接着代表们纷纷提出具体的竞赛口号，车路工人提出创造在年内安全行车一百万公里的新纪录，发电厂保证节煤节电安全送电，架线部保证供电无事故，修造厂保证建立小修制度提高质量。北京被服厂第一缝纫部、裁剪部、消费合作社等单位职工对美机一再犯我领空、杀伤我国人民的罪行，一致喊出了“血债要用血来偿还”的正义呼声。上述三单位也均召开过时事座谈会。
    珍视胜利珍视和平生活
    对美帝侵略决不能不理
    北京公共汽车公司工人齐介山上书毛主席说：“在您英明领导下，中国人民得到了解放；一年来的和平建设，一日千里地前进着。但是垂死的美帝却千方百计地破坏我们的和平建设。现在美帝残暴侵略朝鲜，又轰炸我东北城市及和平居民；很明显，它是企图侵略全亚洲。我们为了亚洲的安全与祖国的建设事业，我们对美帝的一再侵略暴行，不能置之不理了。北京机器总厂工人对比了今昔生活，越发珍惜今天中国人民的胜利，也就越发仇视今天美帝在朝鲜发动的侵略战争，和对中国人民的挑衅行为。该厂机工部小组在时事讨论中，大家说：美帝发动侵朝战争，又要走日本老路犯我祖国领土，它是想把我们中国变成他的殖民地，叫我们再过那吃“混合面”的日子。有的工友说：我们刚翻身一年多，美帝就想来干涉了。钳工部职工一致要求领导上允许他们加班，以提前完成生产任务，支援朝鲜人民。清河制呢厂新厂筹备处及经营、财务二科的职工，于十月二十四、五、六三日专门讨论了美帝侵占我国台湾及侵略朝鲜的问题。他们一致的结论是：正当全世界人民全力进行保卫世界和平之际，美帝却想尽了一切办法破坏世界和平，妄想扩大侵略战争。它在亚洲发动侵略战争，又武装侵占我国台湾，最近更变本加厉地轰炸我东北，将侵略战火引向我祖国边疆。对这一连串的侵略暴行，中国人民绝不能再坐视不理了。他们对美帝提出警告说：应立即撤退侵略台湾及朝鲜的军队，否则中国人民绝对不能予以宽容的。五十年代出版社及经纬、裕华兴、大信等厂工人也均表示对朝鲜人民的同情，和对美帝的愤恨。裕华兴工厂生产互助小组长黄进池前几天看到报上登载的美军在朝鲜的暴行，他愤怒地说：“这比日本鬼子还凶恶残酷！”当天他领着自己的生产小组讨论时事，并提出口号：我们要搞好生产竞赛，我们好好干就是帮助打台湾，支援朝鲜人民，反对美帝！”现在他的生产小组在全厂生产竞赛中起着模范作用。
