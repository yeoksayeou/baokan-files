　　Liu Dezhen, Model Worker of Shijingshan Power Plant
    Actively Leads in Completing Overhaul Tasks
    [Reported by this newspaper] Liu Dezhen, the representative of the Shijingshan Power Plant attending the National Model Worker Conference, has played a good leading role in production and study. In the movement to Resist America, Aid Korea, Protect Our Homes and Defend the Nation, he often took the initiative to lead the workers in the same workshop to study current events, hold symposiums, read the newspaper to everyone, and guide everyone to denounce the atrocities of American imperialism, so that the workers could understand the aggressive conspiracy and brutal atrocities of American imperialism from studying the newspapers and their own experiences, and inspire the workers' patriotic enthusiasm. Recently, the plant carried out a major overhaul of the No. 5 generator. At the beginning of the overhaul, Liu Dezhen proposed "Generating electricity one day earlier strengthens the power to Resist America and Aid Korea." During the overhaul, many difficulties were encountered, and many workers lacked confidence in finding balance. Liu Dezhen proposed, "Major overhauls should solve problems; we won't do things that don't solve problems." He constantly encouraged everyone's morale. In order to complete the overhaul ahead of schedule, he proposed: after each shift, plan and allocate the work for the next shift, without wasting a minute. During the major overhaul, he personally started to find balance and explained the technology to the workers at any time, closely combining the major overhaul with technology, adopting the method of "disassembling and explaining, installing and learning." After forty days of intense effort, the major overhaul was successfully completed, and the problem of large vibrations during past operations was solved. After the final inspection, everyone agreed that the vibration was small, the quality was good, and there was no problem in guaranteeing full load.
