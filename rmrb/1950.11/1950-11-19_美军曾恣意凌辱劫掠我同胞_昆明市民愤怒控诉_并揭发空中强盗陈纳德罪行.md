Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 15th. Kunming citizens are angrily accusing American troops of various bestial atrocities previously committed in Kunming.

　　From 1942 to 1945, a large number of U.S. Army and Air Force personnel gathered in Kunming. These American bandits acted wantonly, and incidents of humiliating and plundering our compatriots occurred many times.

　　Yang Jingwu, a teacher at Kunhua Girls' Middle School, accused American soldiers of attempting to rape a female student surnamed Ding from the school. At 9:00 p.m. on September 17, 1942, when the student surnamed Ding was returning to school from Zheng Yi Road, an American soldier named Charlie followed her closely. The female student surnamed Ding hurriedly ran back to school, but Charlie ignored the doorman's obstruction and rushed into the school, chasing after her to the outside of the female dormitory, shouting and yelling nonsense for up to two hours. At 7:00 p.m. on February 11, 1944, U.S. Army Corporal Tilly, Peterson, and Lieutenant Harbert frantically chased after young women Guo Shuxian and Zhang Jingqing at the Yingmenkou on Huguo Road. The two women fled to Liu Wenbin's house, who ran a small teahouse, but the three bandits followed and broke down the door panels and upstairs door, rushing upstairs and robbing Liu Wenbin of 35,000 yuan in counterfeit legal tender and a leather jacket stored in a leather suitcase. Pointing to the upstairs door, Liu Wenbin said: "The American robbers broke upstairs from here. I really hate those shameless things!" Boss Zhou of the Siemens watch shop on Zheng Yi Road accused American soldiers of another robbery. At 3:00 p.m. on March 31, 1944, two American soldiers drove a jeep to the store to "buy watches." They pulled out pistols, snatched two watches from the shop assistant Lin Yonggen, and drove away. Boss Zhou said: "American soldiers are actually bandits who rob people in broad daylight!"

　　Citizens also accused the U.S. military of violating traffic rules, hitting and killing citizens with their vehicles, and unreasonably beating traffic police. At 11:00 p.m. on September 18, 1943, U.S. Air Force personnel Gulison and another person beat the on-duty police officer Duan Shiqing with the butt of a pistol. Duan immediately fainted to the ground due to a severe head injury. At 2:30 p.m. on July 20, 1945, another bloody incident occurred when a U.S. military truck injured rickshaw pullers and passengers.

　　Citizens angrily accused American imperialism of bloody atrocities, unanimously demanding justice and revenge for the suffering compatriots, and firmly expressed their determination to fight for the sacred task of resisting America, aiding Korea, and defending our homes and country.

　　In addition, the citizens of Kunming also accused the air bandit Chennault. They revealed that the warmonger Chennault unreasonably infringed upon China's air rights, colluded with Kuomintang reactionary government officials and profiteers through the "civilian aircraft" between Kunming and Sui, and Kunming and Hong Kong, and shielded the trafficking of opium, poisoning our people. According to the confession of opium merchant Guo Huaian, who once colluded with the bandit Chen to traffic opium: The criminal Guo trafficked opium three times between 1948 and 1949, amounting to more than 29,000 taels.

    美军曾恣意凌辱劫掠我同胞
    昆明市民愤怒控诉
    并揭发空中强盗陈纳德罪行
    【新华社昆明十五日电】昆明市民正在愤怒控诉美军前此在昆明市的种种兽性暴行。
    一九四二至一九四五年，昆明一度聚集大批美国陆、空军人员，这批美国匪徒恣意妄为，曾多次发生凌辱劫掠我国同胞的事件。
    昆华女中教员杨婧五控诉了美国兵企图强奸该校丁姓女同学的兽行。一九四二年九月十七日晚上九点钟，丁姓学生由正义路回校时，一个叫做查理的美国兵便尾追不舍，丁姓女生匆忙跑回学校，查理竟不顾门房盘阻，奔闯入校，追到女生宿舍门外，胡说乱叫，喃喃不休达两小时之久。一九四四年二月十一日下午七时，又有美军下士地利、彼得逊和中尉哈勿三人在护国路营门口疯狂追赶青年女子郭树仙、张静卿。两女子逃到开小茶馆的刘文彬家里，三个匪徒竟跟着闯进门去，并打碎门板、楼门，一直冲打上楼，将刘文彬存于皮箱内的伪法币三万五千元及皮加克一件抢劫而去。刘文彬指着楼门说：“美国强盗就是从这里打上楼去的。我真恨死那些不要脸的东西！”正义路西门子钟表行的周老板控诉了美国兵的另一件强盗行为。一九四四年三月三十一日下午三时两个美国兵坐吉普车到该店“买表”，他们拔出手枪，从店员林永根手里夺去两只手表，登上车就逃走。周老板说：“美国兵原来就是白天抢人的土匪！”
    市民们还控诉了美军违反交通规则，行车撞杀市民及无理凶殴交通警察的野蛮行为。一九四三年九月十八日晚上十一点钟，美空军人员古利生等二人，用手枪枪柄殴打值班警士段士清，段因头部负伤过重，当即昏倒在地。一九四五年七月二十日午后二时半，又发生了美军大卡车撞伤人力车工人和乘客的血案。
    市民们愤怒控诉美帝国主义的血腥暴行，一致要求为受难的同胞伸冤复仇，并坚决表示要为抗美援朝、保家卫国的神圣任务而奋斗。
    此外，昆明的市民们还控诉了空中强盗陈纳德。他们揭露，战争贩子陈纳德无理侵犯我国航权，利用昆穗、昆港间的“民航机”与国民党反动政府官员及奸商勾结，包庇贩运烟土，毒害我国人民。据曾与陈贼勾结贩运烟土的烟商郭怀安供述：郭犯于一九四八年、四九年间贩运烟土三次，数达二万九千余两。
