　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 1st—In order to liberate the Tibetan compatriots oppressed by imperialism, and consolidate the national defense in the southwest border, the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Southwest Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, along with the Second Field Army Headquarters, jointly issued a political mobilization order to the troops ordered to advance into Tibet. The mobilization order, after extending congratulations to the honorable people's fighters marching into the borderlands of the motherland, pointed out: It is a glorious task to advance into Tibet, liberate the Tibetan people, complete the great cause of unifying the motherland, not to allow imperialism to encroach on an inch of our motherland's territory, and defend and build the motherland's border regions. The mobilization order called on all commanders and fighters, and all Communist Party members, of the advancing troops to display boundless loyalty to the revolutionary cause, deeply understand the great political significance of advancing into Tibet, and make full preparations ideologically, organizationally, and practically, carry forward the glorious traditions of the people's army of being heroic, tenacious, and hardworking, promote the spirit of class love of unity and mutual assistance, and resolutely complete the task of advancing into Tibet. The mobilization order required the advancing troops to closely unite with the compatriots in the Xikang and Tibetan areas, faithfully and correctly implement the ethnic policies stipulated in the Common Program, strictly implement the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention and the Eight-Article Covenant, conduct in-depth investigation and research and propaganda work, learn the local language, understand the living conditions of the local people, care for their hardships, and actively help them to relieve their suffering and difficulties. The mobilization order finally called on every officer and soldier to establish the idea and determination to build Tibet for a long time, pay attention to cherishing and saving manpower and material resources in the advance, actively build roads, and develop transportation construction. Once military action ceases, it is necessary to vigorously develop Tibet's economic and cultural construction, and together with the Tibetan people, jointly build a new democratic and prosperous Tibet, so that the flowers of freedom, happiness, and civilization will bloom all over the motherland's border regions.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 1st—Before departing, the People's Liberation Army troops advancing into Tibet held a solemn and grand oath-taking rally in a certain area in the southwest. The rally opened amidst the thunder of twenty-four cannon salutes, and the venue was shaken by a storm of cheers. The officers and soldiers were full of spirit. The local people rushed to present flags and flowers to the advancing troops. When the worker representatives of a certain match factory unfurled the banner inscribed "Plant the Red Flag on the Himalayas," the entire venue erupted in frenzied applause. The commander of the troops advancing into Tibet delivered a brief but forceful speech at the meeting, saying: "Our troops advancing into Tibet must resolutely complete this great and glorious historical mission. We tell Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the people of the whole country, and all fraternal troops of our determination, we will not only liberate Tibet, but also build Tibet well. We want to warn the imperialists that no inch of territory in our great People's China will allow the existence of the slightest aggressive force!" After the speech, all officers and soldiers held a solemn oath-taking ceremony.
　　Since accepting the great task of advancing into Tibet, the unit has been actively preparing with unparalleled enthusiasm. The entire unit has undergone physical examinations. Many company soldiers have increased their backpacks and practiced marching, striving not to fall behind during the advance. The unit also meticulously investigated and studied the various difficulties caused by the special geographical environment and lifestyle of the Kangzang Plateau, and made full preparations to overcome these difficulties. Officers and soldiers actively participated in Tibetan language learning, and created learning methods such as Tibetan-character playing cards and Tibetan-character literacy cards. Communist Party members of a certain unit wrote in a letter of determination to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu: "We have the noble political qualities and tenacious will of Communist Party members, we are prepared to overcome any difficulties, we will always maintain a full spirit, be united from top to bottom, unite the new and the old, and victoriously complete the task of advancing into Tibet."
