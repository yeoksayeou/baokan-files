　　The Brocade City
　　Lao She
　　I happened to read an American novel, "The Brocade City." I don't know what kind of person the author is. It seems he had been to China, possibly a news reporter.
　　The book describes the hunger and suffering of the Chinese people, the corruption of the Kuomintang officials, the decay of the army, and the tyranny of a capitalist.
　　Logically, since the author detests the Kuomintang reactionaries, he should sympathize with the Communist Party that leads the people's revolution. However, he also described a Chinese Communist, or a woman related to the Party. He used the term "bitch" to describe her.
　　How could this be? The reason is simple: he only saw the ugliness of the Kuomintang reactionaries, but not the heroism and steadfastness of the Communist Party's soldiers, nor the profoundness and breadth of the Communist Party's ideology and ideals.
　　Since he didn't see the real Communist soldiers, why did he open his mouth to curse people? First of all, we must know that he is an American intellectual, not a very bright one. Like many other not-so-bright American intellectuals, he is prejudiced against the Communist Party. They are arrogant, thinking that the American way of life is the best in the world. Since America is the best, anything better than America must be a monster. The reactionary politicians and warlords in America are desperately promoting the defense of the American way of life, precisely targeting these arrogant people.
　　We can say that American culture is currently in a state of stagnant development. In the stagnation of cultural progress, people's feelings towards new things become dull, even fearful of having new feelings. Being afraid of the new, they naturally become proud of the old out of attachment—conservatives are mostly arrogant and ignorant. Those with this arrogant attitude cannot but regard Communists as beasts.
　　New things can only be produced with revolution, which is something the vulgar American writers cannot understand. Since the day the Soviet October Revolution began, until now, they have heard every day how terrible the October Revolution is. The newspapers, magazines, and radio controlled by American capitalists tell them 100% that revolution only involves killing and arson, with no benefits. They would rather live in ease and comfort, watching their government become increasingly reactionary, than think of new solutions. They also don't want foreigners to revolt, because they think revolution only destroys and doesn't build.
　　Thus, the general not-so-bright intellectuals and writers in America look at world affairs with a contemptuous attitude. If they come to China, like the author of "The Brocade City," they will not distinguish between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but scoff at them all.
　　At the same time, such writers, if given the opportunity to receive a sum of money, will fabricate rumors and slanders to oppose the Soviet Union and Communism. A contemptuous attitude cannot produce a firm character, and the temptation of money is hard to resist in America. This is why there are so many rumors in America.
　　The reason why progressive intellectuals and writers in America are persecuted is because they have insight, courage, dare to touch new ideas, have new feelings, and want America to have a new culture too. They have not rioted, but they are put in prison. Their courage frightens the capitalists and warlords, and also makes the vulgar intellectuals panic. They want to break the dikes in the stagnant cultural dead water, so that they can merge with the newest culture in the world. They are "monsters" and should be locked up.
　　On the 33rd anniversary of the October Revolution, I wrote these thoughts after reading "The Brocade City." Yes, after 33 years of painstaking creation, the Soviet Union already has many brocade cities that Americans cannot even imagine. Those cities have music (not jazz), paintings (not American comic strips), sculptures (not American things that resemble nothing), literature (not detective novels), and the will and talent to create a new culture. Most importantly, those cities are created by the people and belong to the people. Those cities are not like American cities, where the rich live in high-rise buildings and the poor have nowhere to sleep.
　　Yes, under the leadership of the Communist Party, we Chinese will also build many brocade cities, following the example of the Soviet Union. The revolutionary history of the Soviet Union has given the revolutionary people of China the greatest inspiration and encouragement, and the friendship and assistance of the Soviet Union has increased our enthusiasm to build a new China. This world is the world of the people, and there are brocade cities everywhere in the world of the people—however, they will certainly not be like the ones written by that American gentleman!

　　锦绣的城
    老舍
    偶然的读到一本美国的新小说，《锦绣的城》。著者是怎样的人，不得而知。看样子，他曾到过中国，可能是位新闻记者。
    书里描写了中国老百姓的饥苦，国民党的官僚的贪污，军队的腐败，和一个资本家的横行霸道。
    按说，著者既憎恶国民党反动派，他就该同情于领导人民革命的共产党。可是，他也描写了一个中国共产党的，或与党有关系的，女子。他用“母狗”形容了她。
    这是怎么一回事呢？原因很简单：他只看见了国民党反动派的丑恶，而不看见共产党的战士们的英勇坚贞，与共产党在思想上理想上的精深远大。
    他既没看见真正的共产党战士，为什么就张嘴骂人呢？首先我们要知道，他是美国的一个不怎么高明的知识分子。跟许多别的美国不高明的知识分子一样，他对共产党抱着偏见。他们狂傲，以为美国的生活方式是世界上最好的。美国的既最好，比美国的更好的必是怪物。美国反动的政客与军阀拼命宣传保卫美国生活方式，正自以这些狂傲的人们为对象。
    我们可以说，现在美国的文化是在停顿发展中。在文化停顿前进中，人们对新事物的感觉就迟钝，甚至于怕有新的感觉。既怕新的，自然对旧的就因依恋而骄傲——保守派多是狂傲无知的。具有这狂傲态度的不能不把共产党人看成为野兽。
    新的事物只能随着革命产生，这又不是美国的庸俗作家们所能理解的。他们自从苏联十月革命起始那一天，直到现在，天天听到十月革命是怎么可怕。美国资本家控制着的报纸，刊物，广播，百分之百的告诉他们革命只有杀人放火，别无好处。他们宁愿苟安，坐视他们的政府日趋反动，也不肯想想新的办法。他们也不愿外国人革命，因为他们以为革命只有破坏，而无建设。
    这样，美国的一般的不高明的知识分子与写家是抱着一种轻蔑态度，去看世界大事的。假若他们来到中国，象《锦绣的城》的著者，他们便不分国民党与共产党，而通通嗤之以鼻。
    同时，这样的写家，假若有机会接到一笔钱，他们就会无中生有的写出谣言与诟骂，去反苏反共。轻蔑态度产生不了坚毅的品格，而金钱的诱惑，在美国，又是不易抗拒的。这也就难怪美国有那么多的谣言了。
    美国进步的知识分子与写家之所以受着迫害，也就是因为他们有见识，有胆气，敢接触新的思潮，有新的感觉，而且愿意美国也有新的文化。他们并没有暴动，可是被放在狱里。他们的勇敢使资本家与军阀们害怕，也使庸俗的知识分子们心慌。他们是要在停顿了的文化死水中，冲开堤防，好与世界上最新的文化合流。他们是“怪物”，应当被锁起来。
    在十月革命三十三周年纪念日，我写出这读了《锦绣的城》的一点感想。是的，苏联经过三十三年的苦心创造，已有了许多座美国人连想也想不到的锦绣的城。那些城，有音乐（不是爵士乐），有图画（不是美国的连环图画），有雕刻（不是美国的什么也不象的东西），有文学（不是侦探小说），有创造新文化的意志与才力。最值得记住的，那些城是由人民创造而属于人民的。那些城不象美国都市那样，富人住高楼大厦，穷人根本没地方睡觉。
    是的，我们中国在共产党领导下，也将建设起多少座锦绣的城，向苏联看齐。苏联的革命史给了中国的革命人民以最大的启示与鼓舞，苏联的友谊与协助增高了我们的能够建设起一个新中国的热情。这个世界是人民的世界，人民的世界里到处有锦绣的城——不过，它们一定不象那位美国先生所写的那样！
