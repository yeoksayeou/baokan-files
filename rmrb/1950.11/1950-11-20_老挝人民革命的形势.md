    The Situation of the Lao People's Revolution
    (Question) We are not very clear about the victorious situation of the Lao people's revolution, and there is very little information about Laos in general publications and books. Please introduce it to us.

    (Answer) Laos, also known as the Lao Kingdom, is a country in Indochina. It is bordered by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to the east, Thailand to the west, Cambodia to the south, and China's Yunnan Province and Burma to the north. It covers an area of over 89,000 square miles and has a population of about 1.5 million. In 1892, Laos became a "protectorate" of France, and the Lao nation has since been subjected to cruel imperialist oppression.

    The northeastern part of Laos is the Hua Phan Plateau, which is rich in cotton; the southern part is the Bolaven Plateau, where animal husbandry is relatively developed. The whole country is covered with mountains and forests, rich in timber, and has abundant mineral resources. However, there is very little development because there are many mountains, so traffic conditions are very poor. Apart from the two highways from the capital Vientiane to Saigon and from Luang Prabang to Vinh (capital of Nghe An province), a coastal city in Vietnam, there is also the Mekong River that runs through the country and can be used by small boats. However, because of the large waterfalls in the southern province of Champasak, ships cannot leave the country. The country is sparsely populated, and it often takes dozens of miles to travel from one village to another. The French colonialists carried out the most barbaric plundering here, and economic development and cultural education were out of the question.

    The French colonialists' senior commissioner resided in the capital Vientiane, while the nominal emperor of Laos resided in Luang Prabang. This emperor was only one of the puppets of French imperialism, and he had no power of control over the other nine provinces and one military region.

    The French colonialists have always used the method of "divide and rule" in Laos to provoke relations between the Lao people and the Vietnamese, because most of the cities have Vietnamese immigrants who either do business or engage in public education. The Lao people mostly farm in the mountains.

    French colonialists often sent troops to Lao villages to conscript laborers, loot property, or recruit soldiers. In order to avoid disaster, the villagers often abandoned their fields and graves and moved to distant places to seek a new life. Before 1945, the Lao people's resistance to the French colonialists was mainly passive. Workers in small factories and mines also sporadically held anti-French strikes, but nationwide resistance has only emerged in recent years.

    In 1945, the wave of the August Revolution in Vietnam spread to the mountainous Laos. At the end of the same year, with the assistance of Vietnamese immigrants, a national government composed of some intellectuals was formed. This government did not have a broad mass base, and when the French colonial army returned to Laos, it was forced to flee to Thailand, accompanied by more than 40,000 Vietnamese immigrants. The members of this government in exile spent three years in Thailand. Some of them defected and were lured and intimidated by the French colonialists, and successively returned to Laos to collude with the French colonialists and the puppet regime. The Lao people despised them.

    In September 1946, during the negotiations for the Franco-Vietnamese Provisional Agreement, the French High Commissioner D'Argenlieu convened pseudo-representatives from Cochinchina, Cambodia, and Laos and announced that Laos was an "independent country" within the French Federation of Indochina. The "Élysée Accords," also known as the "March 8th Agreement," signed between France and Bảo Đại in 1949, recognized D'Argenlieu's decision, and the French Parliament "approved" it on January 29, 1950. The Lao people do not believe in this kind of deceptive trick of the French colonialists.

    When the French army returned to Laos in 1945, although the so-called Lao "central government" was in exile abroad, the "Lao Issara" movement, or the Lao Independence League movement, ignited like sparks in the mountainous villages. Due to economic and cultural backwardness, Laos did not have separate organizations for parties, trade unions, or peasant associations. Patriotic people in each village and town organized themselves into an "Issara." This patriotic organization gradually adopted a more advanced form with the anti-French struggle. Later, the "Issara" had organizations such as a youth militia department and a women's department, and the "Issara" in various regions gradually established contact. In mid-August of this year, the Lao people held a national assembly, attended by more than 100 representatives from all ethnic groups and strata in the Lao liberated areas and enemy-occupied areas. The assembly resolved to establish the "Lao Liberation Front" and the Lao Resistance United Government. The establishment of the national united front and the united government will further strengthen the Lao people's struggle against the aggression of French and American imperialists. The Lao People's Armed Forces – the People's Liberation Army and the militia – are constantly attacking the enemy. In the first five months of this year, the results of the battle were: 11 battles, 120 French troops killed, 12 captured, one mortar seized, 40 rifles, one ton of bullets, and 25 puppet soldiers surrendered. In one battle in May, French commander Major Vencala was killed. This people's armed force is growing stronger.

    The Lao liberated areas are developing and consolidating in the northeastern, eastern, and southeastern regions of the country, as well as on the east bank of the Mekong River. Although the French army controls some cities such as the capital and provincial capitals, its strength is weakening.

    The Lao people enthusiastically respond to the call for production competitions, and want to produce twice as much rice this year as last year. A nationwide campaign to eliminate illiteracy has also been launched.

    When Japan occupied Vietnam, the reactionary Thai government of Plaek Phibunsongkhram once occupied the Lao territory west of the Mekong River, which was only returned after Japan surrendered. The reactionary Thai government is now openly acting as a watchdog for American imperialism's aggression in Southeast Asia, and is watching Laos like it did when it served as a tool for Japanese imperialism.

    The Vietnamese People's Army is currently advancing towards Lai Châu and Sơn La areas. The French colonialists are deeply afraid that the Lao people's armed forces will meet with the Vietnamese People's Army on the border, and are trying to promote the dispatch of a battalion of paratroopers to the Điện Biên Phủ area. However, the French colonialists in Laos are ultimately destined to fail, just like in Vietnam. Recently, a French reporter reported: Guerrilla activity occurs a few miles outside of Vientiane. This means that the largest and last foothold of the French colonialists in Laos has already been shaken.

### 老挝人民革命的形势

　　老挝人民革命的形势
    （问）我们对老挝人民革命的胜利形势，不很清楚，而一般刊物及书籍上，介绍老挝情况的又很少。请为我们介绍一下。
    太原读者岳崇礼，北京市立二中樊炳烈等
    （答）老挝、又叫寮国，是印度支那的一个国家，东邻越南民主共和国，西邻泰国、南邻柬埔寨、北和我国的云南省和缅甸接境。面积八万九千余方英里，人口约一百五十万。一八九二年，老挝成为法国的“保护国”，老挝民族从此受到帝国主义残酷的压迫了。
    老挝东北部为华班高原，盛产棉花；南部为波罗芬高原，牧畜业比较发达。全国到处是山林地区，盛产木材，矿藏非常丰富。但开发的很少，因为山地多，所以交通条件太差。除了从首都万象通往西贡和从浪勃剌邦通往越南的海岸城市永州（义安省省会）的两条公路以外，还有一条纵贯全国的湄公河可通小船，但是因为这条河在南方的百寨省境有着大瀑布的关系，船只也是不能出国的。全国地广人稀，从这村到那村，往往要走几十里。法国殖民者在这里进行着最野蛮的掠夺，经济开发与文化教育的设施也就谈不到了。
    法国殖民者的高级专员驻在首都万象，至于老挝的名义上的皇帝则驻在浪勃剌邦。这个皇帝仅是法帝国主义的傀儡之一，他对另外的九个省和一个军区没有什么控制的权力。
    法国殖民者一向在老挝以“分而治之”的手法挑拨老挝人与越南人之间的关系，因为大多数城市中都有越南侨民，他们或经商，或从事公教工作。而老挝人则大多在山中耕田。
    法国殖民者经常派兵到老挝的农村中拉夫、抢劫东西或征兵。为了避祸，往往全村居民丢弃田园庐墓，迁往远方另寻生活。在一九四五年以前，老挝人民对法国殖民者的抵抗，主要是消极的。小型工厂及矿山的工人也曾零星的举行过反法罢工，但全国性的反抗却是近年来才有了端倪。
    一九四五年越南的八月革命浪潮波及到山地的老挝。同年年底，在越南侨民协助下，产生了一些知识分子所组成的全国性政府。这个政府没有广大的群众基础，等到法国殖民军重回老挝，就被迫逃入泰国，随行流亡的尚有四万余越南侨民。这个流亡政府的人员在泰国过了三年，有些变节的受了法国殖民者的诱骗与威吓，陆续回到老挝，与法国殖民者及傀儡政权同流合污。老挝人民是唾弃了他们的。
    一九四六年九月，正当法越临时协定谈判的时候，法国高级专员达尚礼安，召集了交趾支那、柬埔寨与老挝的伪代表，宣布老挝是印度支那的法兰西联邦内的“独立国”。一九四九年法国与保大签订的《艾斯宫协定》，即《三八协定》，承认达尚礼安的决定，法国国会于一九五○年一月二十九日又“批准”了它。老挝人民是不相信法国殖民者这一种骗人的把戏的。
    一九四五年法军重回老挝时，所谓老挝“中央政府”虽然流亡国外，但是“老挝——伊色拉”运动即老挝独立同盟运动却像星星之火在山地农村点燃起来。由于经济、文化落后，老挝没有党派、工会、农会的各别组织，每村每镇的爱国人民就组织在一个“伊色拉”中。这一爱国组织随着抗法斗争而逐渐采取较高级的形式。后来“伊色拉”中有了青年民兵部、妇女部等组织，各地区的“伊色拉”又逐渐有了联系。在今年八月中旬老挝人民举行国民议会，出席老挝解放区及敌占区各民族各阶层代表百余人，议会决议成立“老挝解放阵线”，成立老挝抵抗联合政府。民族统一阵线及联合政府的成立将使老挝人民反抗法美帝国主义侵略者的斗争益发加强。老挝人民武装——人民解放军及民兵，不断地出击敌人，今年头五个月的战果是：作战十一次，毙法军一百二十人，俘十二人，缴获迫击炮一门，步枪四十枝，子弹一吨，伪军二十五名投诚。五月间一次战役中曾击毙法军指挥官文卡拉少校。这一支人民武装正在壮大中。
    老挝解放区正在境内的东北、东部和东南地区以及湄公河东岸发展并巩固着，法军虽然控制了首都及省会等一些城市，但是它的力量正在削弱下去。
    老挝人民热烈地响应生产竞赛的号召，要在今年内生产比去年多一倍的米。全国规模的扫除文盲工作也已展开了。
    当日本侵占越南时，泰国的銮披汶反动政府，曾经侵占湄公河以西的老挝的土地，在日本投降后才归还。泰国反动政府现在公开地充当着美国帝国主义侵略东南亚的警犬，它像先前充当日本帝国主义的工具时期一样正在窥伺着老挝。
    越南人民军目前正向莱州、山罗一带挺进。法国殖民者深怕老挝的人民武装与越南人民军在边境上会师，竭力宣传将向深萝一带投送伞兵一营。但是，法国殖民者在老挝终究同在越南一样，是注定要失败的。最近一个法国记者报道：一出万象数里便有游击队的活动。这就是说，法国殖民者在老挝的最大的也是最后的立足点已经发生动摇了。编者（附图片）
