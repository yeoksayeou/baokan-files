　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 30th (TASS): Today's Pravda published an article by Alexandrov, "Lackey of Wall Street," evaluating UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie. The article stated that the UN Charter clearly stipulates the duties of the UN Secretary-General and points out the qualifications that the administrative head of the UN organization must possess. The Secretary-General must be objective and faithful to the Charter and the cause of the UN—namely, the cause of strengthening international peace and security. Alexandrov said that we must remember these self-evident truths because Trygve Lie, who occupies such an important international position as the UN Secretary-General, has, during his five-year tenure, reduced himself to the role of a lackey of the US State Department and an accomplice of warmongers. Instead of becoming an international figure whose primary responsibility is to uphold the UN Charter, Lie has become one of those who violate this Charter. Therefore, he has completely lost the trust of many UN member states. Lie's name has become synonymous with deceitful double-dealers and those who kowtow to their American masters.

　　Alexandrov recounted that when Lie took office as Secretary-General, he vowed to ensure objectivity and independence in his political views. But experience has shown that this was just a smokescreen, which Lie would later use to deceive international public opinion about his true intention to turn the entire UN Secretariat into a branch of the US State Department. Lie's double-dealing is typical throughout his tenure as Secretary-General. Although Lie once flaunted himself as a "peace envoy" and even drafted a special "Twenty-Year Peace Plan" while traveling to the capitals of various countries, it has now been revealed that the purpose of his trip was completely unrelated to the task of strengthening peace and international cooperation. His trip was merely acting as an American salesman. Recently, Lie has taken off his mask. He openly approves and supports the US policy of aggression and launching new wars. It is obvious to everyone that he is trying to turn the entire UN Secretariat into a branch of the State Department.

　　Alexandrov further wrote that the US authorities, who have already violated their obligations to the UN organization headquartered in the United States, have gone further and trampled on the most basic rights of the UN. For example, the US government has repeatedly refused and is still refusing to grant entry visas to progressive journalists or representatives of international democratic organizations, preventing them from attending UN General Assembly meetings. Lie has always acquiesced to these illegal and arbitrary actions by the US authorities. At the same time, with the direct participation of the current Secretary-General, the UN organization has been stained with the stain of traitors from Czechoslovakia and other peoples, and with the stain of anti-Soviet dregs of the White Army. Alexandrov emphasized that Lie has betrayed the trust of the UN member states, and therefore he is not and cannot be a representative of the UN authority that a Secretary-General should be. Regarding Lie's five-year term, which expires on February 1, 1951, after he was elected as Secretary-General, Alexandrov wrote that the issue of the election of the Secretary-General has been included in the agenda of the fifth session of the UN General Assembly. According to the Charter, the Secretary-General shall be appointed by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council, and the Security Council, like all other important issues, must, in accordance with the Charter, pass a recommendation for the successor to the Secretary-General. In view of the fact that the Soviet delegation and many other delegations have declared that they cannot accept Lie's re-election, many other candidates have been nominated in the Security Council—such as Rau (India), Nájera (Mexico), Romulo (Philippines), Malik (Lebanon). The Security Council could undoubtedly have passed a unanimous decision on one of these candidates. If this has not been achieved, it is entirely due to the arrogant oppression and obstruction of other delegations by the US delegation. The US delegation, which is not ashamed of any means, is trying to trick its servant Lie into the position of Secretary-General at all costs. Suspecting that the attempt to re-elect Lie for another five years might not succeed, the US delegation invented a very clumsy trick, proposing to extend his term by another two or three years. Alexandrov pointed out: But everyone who respects the UN Charter can clearly see that this proposal is in conflict with the Charter and previous resolutions of the General Assembly. Alexandrov concluded that the United States' insistence on deceiving Lie's succession, regardless of the rights granted to the Security Council by the UN Charter, is another manifestation of American dictatorship and arbitrariness, which undermines the very foundation of international organizations. The United Nations must not tolerate such means used by arrogant Charter violators.

　　华尔街的侍从长—赖伊
    ·亚历山大罗夫·
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科三十日电：今日真理报刊有亚历山大罗夫所著《华尔街的侍从长》一文，对于联合国秘书长赖伊予以评价。该文称，联合国宪章明白确切的规定了联合国秘书长的职责，并指出联合国组织行政首长所必须具备的资格。秘书长对于宪章与联合国的事业——即加强国际和平与安全的事业——必须客观而忠诚。亚历山大罗夫说，我们必须要记住这些自明的道理，因为占据了联合国秘书长这样重要国际职位的赖伊，在他五年的任职期间，已经把他自己降为美国国务院的侍从，战争贩子的同谋者的角色。赖伊非但没有成为一个其主要职责即在维护联合国宪章的国际人物，反而成为违犯这个宪章的人们之一。因此，他已完全失去许多联合国会员国的信任。赖伊的名字已经成为心怀欺诈的两面派以及在美国的主子们面前卑躬屈膝的人们的同义语。
    亚历山大罗夫追述说，当赖伊就任秘书长的时候，他曾誓言保证在他的政治观点上要客观而独立。但经验已表明，这不过是一种烟幕，赖伊以后就常用这种烟幕，在他想把整个联合国秘书长变为美国国务院支部的真正意图上欺骗国际舆论。赖伊的两面派手法是他整个秘书长任期内的典型。赖伊虽然曾以“和平使者”的姿态炫耀，并且在旅行各大国首都时还拟定了特别的“二十年和平计划”，但是现在已经揭穿，实际上他这次旅行的目的，是与加强和平及国际合作的任务毫不相干的。他的旅行只是在作一个美国的推销员而已。最近赖伊已经揭下他的假面具。他公开赞成与拥护美国的侵略与发动新战争的政策。他正设法把整个的联合国秘书处变为国务院的支部，已是人所共见的事。
    亚历山大罗夫又写道，已经对于总部设于美国境内的联合国组织违犯了应尽义务的美国当局，更进而把联合国最基本的权利践踏在脚下。例如美国政府过去一再拒绝现在还在拒绝给予进步的记者或国际民主组织的代表以入境签证，不让他们参加联合国大会会议。对于美国当局这些非法而独断的行动，赖伊总是默认。同时，在现任秘书长的直接参加之下，联合国的机构已经染上捷克斯洛伐克及其他人民的卖国贼的污点，已经染上白卫军的反苏渣滓的污点。亚历山大罗夫强调指出，赖伊已经辜负了联合国会员国的信任，因此他自然就不是而且也不能是作为一个秘书长所应该是的联合国权威的代表。关于赖伊被选为秘书长后到一九五一年二月一日即届期满的五年任期，亚历山大罗夫写道，秘书长的选举问题已列入在联大第五届会议的议程。根据宪章，秘书长应由大会根据安理会的推荐而任命，而安理会对于这个问题也像对于其他一切重要问题一样，必须依照宪章，对于秘书长继任人选的推荐予以通过。鉴于苏联代表团与其他许多代表团都已声明不能接受再由赖伊继任这种事实，许多别的候选人已在安理会中被提名——例如劳氏（印度），纳孚（墨西哥），罗慕洛（菲律宾），麦里克（黎巴嫩）。安理会对于这些候选人之一无疑原可以通过一个一致协议的决定。假若未能达到这一点，那完全是因为美国代表团对于其他代表团的蛮横压迫与阻挠。对于任何手段均不感羞耻的美国代表团，是要不惜一切硬要为其仆从赖伊骗取到秘书长的位置的。由于怀疑再使赖伊当选五年的企图不一定成功，美国代表团就发明了一个很笨拙的骗术，建议将其任期再延长两三年。亚历山大罗夫指出：但是每个尊重联合国宪章的人，都可以明显地看出，这个建议是与宪章以及联大以前的决议冲突的。亚历山大罗夫结语说，美国不顾联合国宪章授与安理会的权利，硬要骗取赖伊的继任，是美国独裁与专横的另一表现，这种独裁与专横破坏着国际组织的本身基础。联合国绝不能容忍傲慢的宪章违犯者们所用的这种手段。
