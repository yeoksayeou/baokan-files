　　Shandong Rongjun General School Holds Anti-American Forum
    Shed Blood for the Liberation of the Motherland
    Today Willing to Dedicate Everything to Defend the Motherland
    [Our Newspaper] The Shandong Rongjun General School held a forum to oppose American imperialist aggression. These people, who shed blood and made great contributions to the liberation of the motherland, expressed extremely intolerable indignation at the aggressive actions of the American robbers who are trying to seize the fruits of the Chinese people's victory today. They wished they could immediately inflict a fatal blow on the American imperialists. The school's directly affiliated middle school department held a small group discussion on October 30th. Zhou Zijiu from Group 5 of Class A said angrily at the meeting: "We must resolutely stop the American imperialists' aggressive behavior. We Chinese people have stood up and can no longer tolerate their bullying. My injury has healed, and my disability is not severe. I will definitely pick up my gun again and fight them!" In the afternoon of the same day, representatives from various study groups and other units of the school jointly held a forum. Everyone spoke enthusiastically, filled with a surge of love for the motherland and hatred for the American imperialists. Zhao Changshun, a one-armed veteran, said: "The victory of our Chinese people was won with blood and flesh. Our disabilities were caused by American bullets in the struggle for victory. My arm was blown off by American shells. The American imperialists are our enemies, and we must settle accounts with them! Although our bodies are disabled, our will is strong. We are willing to contribute everything to the motherland and defend world peace!" The forum finally passed a letter to Chairman Mao, representing all the veterans of Shandong Rongjun School, supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's accusation to the United Nations, and expressing the veterans' unwavering fighting spirit to defend the motherland.

　　山东荣军总校举行反美座谈
    为了祖国的解放曾流出鲜血
    今天愿意献出一切保卫祖国
    【本报讯】山东荣军总校举行座谈会，反对美帝侵略。这些为祖国的解放而流出了鲜血、立下了汗马功劳的人们，对今天企图夺取中国人民胜利果实的美国强盗的侵略行为，更是表现了万分不可容忍的愤慨情绪。他们恨不得马上给美帝以致命痛击。该校直属中学部，于十月三十日举行小组漫谈。甲班五组周子久在会上愤愤地说：“我们要坚决制止美帝的侵略行为。我们中国人民已经站起来了，再也不能忍受它的欺侮了，我个人的伤已经好了，残废不重，我一定再拿起枪来和他干！”当日下午，该校各单位学习小组等代表多人又联合举行座谈，个个踊跃发言，洋溢着一片热爱祖国与痛恨美帝的激昂情绪。独臂荣军赵长顺说：“我们中国人民的胜利，是用血肉头颅换来的。我们的残废就是在争取胜利中被美帝的子弹打的。我的臂膀就是美国炮弹打掉的。美帝是我们的仇敌，我们要和他算账！我们的身体虽已残废，但意志是坚强的，我们愿把一切贡献给祖国，保卫世界的和平！”座谈会最后通过了给毛主席的一封信，代表山东荣校全体荣军，拥护周外长向联合国提出的控诉，和表示荣军坚决保卫祖国的不屈斗志。
