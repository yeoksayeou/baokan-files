    Iraqi Communist Leader Fahd and Others Executed
    [Xinhua News Agency] The reactionary Iraqi government, under the wing of British imperialism, is intensifying its persecution of Iraqi progressives. According to a Cairo dispatch from the Telepress Agency on the 21st, Iraqi Communist leaders Fahd, Bashimah, and Shiweiwei, among others, were recently arrested by the Sadd government, which is supported by British imperialism, and executed in Baghdad without trial. In Baghdad and Mosul, hundreds of progressive citizens and peace fighters have been arrested by the reactionary Iraqi government and sent to concentration camps in the desert. The Sadd government's atrocities in persecuting progressives have aroused resistance from the Iraqi people.
