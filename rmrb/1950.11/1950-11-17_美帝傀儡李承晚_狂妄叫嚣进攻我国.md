　　American Puppet Syngman Rhee
    Brazenly Yells to Attack Our Country
    [Xinhua News Agency, 16th] The American imperialist puppet Syngman Rhee is brazenly yelling to attack our country. According to Agence France-Presse and Reuters: Syngman Rhee, at his weekly press conference on the 13th, declared without any restraint that the war launched by the American-Rhee gang against the Korean people "cannot stop at the Yalu River." He said arrogantly: "With the assistance of the United Nations forces, we may be able to drive the Communist army across the Yalu River, but we do not believe that this is the end of the war." These yells by Syngman Rhee once again confirmed the plans stated in the secret documents of the American-Rhee gang captured by the Korean People's Army, that the purpose of the American-Rhee gang in launching this anti-people war is not only to occupy North Korea, but also to attack China.

　　美帝傀儡李承晚
    狂妄叫嚣进攻我国
    【新华社十六日讯】美帝国主义在朝鲜的傀儡李承晚，狂妄地叫嚣进攻我国。据法新社和路透社消息：李承晚于十三日在他的每周记者招待会上，竟肆无忌惮地宣称美、李匪帮对朝鲜人民所发动的战争，“不能停在鸭绿江边”。他狂妄地说：“在联合国军队的援助下，我们或能把共军赶过鸭绿江，但我们并不以为这就是战争的结束。”李承晚这些叫嚣，再次证实了朝鲜人民军缴获的美、李匪帮秘密文件中所说明的计划，即美、李匪帮发动这次反人民战争的目的，不仅在于要占领朝鲜北部，而且是要进攻中国。
