　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 15th—The people of Northeast China, who have been directly persecuted by U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, are accusing the American aggressors and expressing their determination to resolutely support the Korean people in their resistance against American aggression.
　　The farmers of Shannanzhuang Village, Heishan County, Liaoxi Province, which was bombed with bombs and incendiary bombs by U.S.-Chiang aircraft in October 1948, gnash their teeth when they recall the tragic scene at the time, saying, "This blood debt must be repaid by the American devils." Farmer Cao Yongchao said, "The American-style plane with five heads (referring to five propellers) killed my mother and sister. I will not be content until this hatred is avenged." Sun Chuqing, a seventy-one-year-old man in the village, had half of his arm blown off and has not yet recovered. His son, Sun Shaoqin, said angrily, "My father has been groaning in pain every day for the past two years. I have never forgotten this hatred for a minute. Now I want to personally go to Korea to take revenge on the American bandits."
　　The families and relatives of a large number of patriotic youths who were killed by U.S.-Chiang reactionary secret agents before the liberation of Changchun have also firmly stated that they will fight to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea to protect their homes and defend the country. The father of Yu Peifen (female), a patriotic youth who was assassinated and brutally murdered by U.S.-Chiang secret agents, said sadly and indignantly, "Although I am old, I understand medicine. I am willing to use my skills to serve the just war against aggression." Yu Peifen's younger brother, Yu Fei, said, "In order to protect the safety of the motherland and the happy life of my family, I want to learn from my sister's spirit of fighting the enemy and participate in the great liberation war of the Korean people."
　　Wang Weimin, a Hui Muslim youth from Chengde City, Rehe Province, stroked the scar on his left leg where he was wounded by Chiang's bandits and said sternly, "This is a mark of hatred imprinted on me by the bullets of the American aggressors. I want to go to the front line of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea to demand this blood debt with bullets."
　　The people on the right bank of the Yalu River in Liaodong Province, who were recently strafed and bombed by U.S. Air Force planes invading Korea, hate the bloody atrocities of the U.S. aggression against Korea and China with utmost bitterness. Fang Shirong, a worker who was wounded by U.S. planes at Andong Airport, has already joined the volunteer stretcher team to aid Korea. Yang Decheng, a fisherman from Gulouzi Village, Kuandian County, who had four fingers blown off by bullets from American planes on the river, has now packed up his small boat and is preparing to cross the river to help the Korean People's Army transport supplies and resist American aggression. Another fisherman, Chen Shengkui, is recuperating at home. He said that after his injury heals, he will also row a boat to transport supplies for the Korean People's Army. Wu Xirong, the brother of the deceased fisherman Wu Xichun, has already joined the large cart team going to Korea to participate in the war. Now the people of the village have automatically organized ten stretchers and forty-one carts, which are about to go to Korea to support the Korean people's war of resistance against the United States.

　　东北直接受美蒋迫害人民
    控诉美帝侵略暴行
    坚决支援朝鲜兄弟
    【新华社沈阳十五日电】东北地区直接遭受过美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮迫害的人民，纷纷控诉美国侵略者，并表示坚决支援朝鲜人民反抗美国侵略的决心。
    一九四八年十月曾被美蒋飞机用炸弹和大批烧夷弹炸毁的辽西省黑山县山南庄村农民，提起当时的惨景，都咬牙切齿地表示：“这笔血债一定要美国鬼子偿还。”农民曹永超说：“炸死了我的妈妈和姐姐的，是五个脑袋（指五个推进器）的美国式飞机，这个仇一天不报，我一天不能甘心。”该村七十一岁的老人孙楚清被炸断半截胳膊，至今还未治愈，他的儿子孙绍琴愤怒地说：“我父亲这两年，每天都在痛楚呻吟，我一分钟也没有忘记这个仇恨，现在我要亲自到朝鲜去向美寇报仇。”
    长春解放前被美蒋反动特务所杀害的大批爱国青年的家属和亲友，也坚决表示要为抗美援朝保家卫国而斗争。被美蒋特务刺杀惨死的爱国青年于佩芬（女）的父亲悲愤地说：“我虽已年老，但我懂得医术，我愿以自己的技术为反抗侵略的正义战争服务。”于佩芬的弟弟于飞说：“为了保卫祖国的安全和家庭的幸福生活，我要学习姐姐向敌人斗争的精神，去参加朝鲜人民的伟大解放战争。”
    热河省承德市回民青年王为民，抚摸着他身上被蒋匪打伤的左腿上的疤痕厉声地说：“这是美国侵略者的子弹给我印上的仇恨记号，我要到抗美援朝的最前线去，用子弹来讨还这笔血债。”
    在辽东省鸭绿江右岸，最近被美国侵朝空军飞机扫射轰炸的人民，对美国侵略朝鲜侵略中国的血腥暴行莫不切齿痛恨。在安东机场被美机打伤的工人房世荣，早已参加了志愿援朝的担架队。在宽甸县古楼子村江面上被美国飞机的子弹打掉了四个手指的渔夫杨德诚，现在已收拾好自己的小船，准备过江帮助朝鲜人民军运输，反抗美国的侵略。另一渔夫陈盛奎正在家中疗养，他表示伤好以后也要撑船替朝鲜人民军运输。死难渔夫吴锡纯的兄弟吴锡荣，已经参加了赴朝参战的大车队。现在该村人民已经自动组织起十付担架，四十一辆大车，即将前往朝鲜支援朝鲜人民的抗美战争。
