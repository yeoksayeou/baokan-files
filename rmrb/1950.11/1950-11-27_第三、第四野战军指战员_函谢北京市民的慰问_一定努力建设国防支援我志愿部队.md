[This article transmitted by the Beijing Municipal News Agency] The Beijing Municipal People's Government recently received a batch of letters from commanders and fighters of the Third and Fourth Field Armies from the front lines of national defense to the citizens of Beijing. These letters were written after they received letters of condolence from workers, students, and people from all walks of life in Beijing around the "August 1st" Army Day. In their letters, they deeply thanked the workers, students, and people from all walks of life for their care and condolences, and expressed their determination to vigorously build national defense and fight to the end to eliminate the aggressive forces of imperialism and their running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang. The letters expressed infinite indignation at the American imperialists' aggression against our neighboring country of Korea and their aggressive acts on our borders, and demanded that people from all walks of life "not listen to rumors," "pay attention to severely suppressing bandit and special agent activities," and support our Chinese People's Volunteer Army in resisting American imperialist aggression. The letter from a certain company of a certain regiment stated: The love and help they received while stationed in Beijing has always encouraged them to strive for meritorious service in combat and production. The letter from a certain regiment stated: "We will resolutely implement Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order on National Day, and fight for the liberation of Taiwan and Tibet, for the elimination of bandits and special agents, for the stability of social order, and for the defense of the motherland and world peace, to repay the expectations of our fellow villagers." The letters also unanimously and enthusiastically expressed that they are very willing to communicate with people from all over the country on a regular basis.
