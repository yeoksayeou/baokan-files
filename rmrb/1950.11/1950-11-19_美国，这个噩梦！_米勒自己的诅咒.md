　　America, This Nightmare!
    Miller's Own Curse
    Xiao Qian
    The American writer Maddison committed suicide. This is understandable. The fascist-leaning Truman regime's frantic external aggression and internal repression precisely demonstrates that American imperialism is nearing its end, and the collapse of the American capitalist social order is increasingly accelerating. In such an environment, the American literary and artistic circles, parasitic on this social order, are bound to experience increasingly profound anguish, and their division is bound to become increasingly clear. Either surrender, or fight on more resolutely and bravely; if one hesitates and looks around, and one's conscience is not extinguished but one's understanding is insufficient, then there is the possibility of following Maddison's tragic path. I am therefore reminded of Steinbeck, who once wrote the "progressive" *The Grapes of Wrath*, Wilder, who wrote *The Bridge of San Luis Rey*, and also Henry Miller.

    Miller, this gravedigger, bartender, life insurance salesman, garbage collector, and beggar, once used intense brushstrokes to depict and curse his misfortunes; although his position was wavering, even absurd, readers were able to vent some of their dissatisfaction with reality through those curses, so Miller became popular on both sides of the Atlantic, and had many readers.

    Among Miller's dozen novels, travelogues, and essays, *Tropic of Cancer* was the most sensational, and was hailed as a "remarkable" harvest in the Anglo-American bourgeois literary world since the publication of *Ulysses* in 1922. This is a "heavenly book" that is as difficult to understand as *Ulysses*, a "dirty book" that displays and caresses the sores on the bourgeoisie's body. It writes about the lower depths of Parisian society, which are even more gloomy than hell—prostitutes, vagrants, poverty, disease, theft, syphilis, excrement…so dirty that it is unbearable to look at, so much so that it was banned as soon as it was published—and this, of course, is just officialdom, and rather serves as a more powerful advertisement for it, allowing the bootlegging booksellers to earn more profits. Such a work that exposes the ugliness of capitalist society to the fullest extent is naturally not the glory or pleasure of the Anglo-American ruling class, but we cannot call it an "exposure" of capitalist society. To be precise, it is a product of the literary and artistic world of the dying period of capitalism reaching the end of its rope. It is a reflection of the extreme moral degradation of the bourgeoisie. Bourgeois literature, at the end of its rope, has nothing more to attract readers, so it has to come up with detective stories, murder cases, pornography, and all kinds of "dirty" things—physiological filth, psychological filth, and even dirty words that cannot be found in the dictionary. Although Miller thought that he was only objectively describing "reality," he was actually playing an inglorious role—he was completely a prisoner of bourgeois ideology.

    Even so, in the American capitalist society where the spoils are never divided evenly, Miller, who was born poor, is not easy to fully integrate with the gold standard rulers. On the contrary, he is full of complaints. So he issued his curse. For example, when he was staying in a hotel in Pittsburgh, he said—

    "If I continue to live in this room, I will either go crazy or commit suicide. The ghosts of this place, the ghosts of the builders of this ugly city, appear and disappear on the walls, as if they want to murder someone. I am suffocating and cannot breathe.

    "I went out to get some fresh air. I suddenly felt like I was back in Tsarist Russia. I saw the terrible Ivan, followed by a large string of snub-nosed animals. … Just one look at them is enough to make people want to start a revolution; how I want to drag them down from their leaping horses and knock their clumsy heads hard a few times. How I want to smash this kind of 'law and order.'" (*Sunday After the War*, p. 7.)

    Miller's "wanting" is naturally just thinking about it. But from his indignation, we can also see how "that room" in America makes people "suffocate."

    Despite how the American imperialists themselves and their cosmopolitan henchmen brag about "American civilization" and "American culture," in fact, in this "room" that suffocates people to the point of madness and suicide, "civilization" is precisely the culmination of "barbarism" in the twentieth century, and "culture" is a desolate desert. Even Miller, who played the role of a prisoner of the ideology of the declining bourgeoisie, had to admit with resentment and sadness:

    "There is not a single fearless warrior of truth in the entire publishing industry. There is not a single film company that focuses on art rather than money. We have no theaters worthy of being called theaters, and almost all of our theaters are clustered in one city. We have no music of our own except what the blacks give us. There are not even ten creative writers. The murals in our public buildings are at the aesthetic level of middle school students, perhaps even worse. Our museums are filled with dead and heavy antiques. The monuments we build in the squares are enough to make the dead restless in their graves. Our appreciation of architecture has dropped to zero. … All that was once beautiful, important, and promising has been buried under the avalanche of our false progress. What Europe has damaged in a thousand years of incessant wars is not as much as our hundred years of 'peace and progress.'" (*Sunday After the War*, p. 15.)

    Such an assessment from Miller's mouth is never exaggerated.

    In another place, his curse even carries more criticality, although the position is vague, it almost touches the core of the American reactionary social order.

    "We are known as the country with the largest production in the world, but more than a third of our population cannot get enough to eat, cannot get enough to wear, and has no place to live. Large tracts of land are barren due to disregard, greed, and destruction. Eighty years ago, we fought a bloody battle in our country that was one of the bloodiest in human history, but we have not been able to explain why we fought that battle to this day. As liberators of slaves, we have not given the slaves true freedom and equality; at the same time, we have made white people slaves as well. That's right, the industrial North defeated the aristocratic South—the fruits of victory are vividly visible. But where there is industry, there is ugliness, poverty, oppression, bleakness, and despair. Banks teach us to save all day long so that they can prosper; as a result, they swindle our purses empty, and they even threaten to cancel even the little interest we have if we don't listen to them. Three-quarters of the world's gold is buried underground in Kentucky. How many inventions are bound in the high pavilions of the Patent Office, or bought and destroyed by those forces that control our destiny, because under our ridiculous system, all good things that may benefit mankind can become disasters. In sparsely populated lands, a large number of surplus goods are produced, and the extremely few people who own all the property believe that not only can they not accommodate millions of European famine victims, but also our own large team of famine victims has nowhere to set foot. The most ridiculous thing is that we send missionaries to the far corners of the earth to collect money from the poor, penny by penny, to support these blinded devils (who do not represent Christ, just as I am not the Pope), while those churches cannot save the frail, lonely, and oppressed in their own homes. Our hospitals, lunatic asylums, and prisons are overcrowded. Shadowy and intangible corporate entities own towns as large as some European countries, in which almost no one lives. The tentacles of these corporate entities are spread all over the country, and no one can stipulate or clearly state their responsibilities. A person sits in an easy chair in New York or San Francisco, surrounded by all kinds of luxuries, but also by terror and anxiety.

    "This person controls the lives and futures of millions of men and women he has never seen and does not want to meet, and he is indifferent to the fate of those men and women.

    "This is the progress of the United States of America in 1941. Since I have no Red Indian, black, or Mexican blood, I cannot get any pleasure from venting my anger by depicting this picture of white civilization. My ancestors fled their birthplace (Germany) because they did not want to be soldiers. Ironically, my descendants cannot escape that military service; the entire white world will become a barracks." (*Sunday After the War*, p. 10.)

    That's right, the problem lies in that "system" in America—not some "ridiculous" system, but a bloody and evil system. So what to do? Miller did not have the courage to further face the facts and make an answer. Like all liars, he sang the old tune of "the end of the world" as his answer. In his book *The Air-Conditioned Nightmare* (p. 134, "Arkansas and the Great Pyramid"), he imagined the arrival of the end of the world. The "ridiculous" thing is that he also imagined a pyramid—built by a good-hearted protagonist named Harvey who raised tens of thousands of gold dollars—in which the essence of "human civilization" is preserved, hanging down forever. The almighty gold dollar can even be manifested in Miller's "end of the world"!

    The reason why Miller's indignation is powerless is precisely because he has not fundamentally escaped the clutches of the gold dollar. He knows very well that in America, "even under the best conditions, a worker has to sell all his rights as a human being." "In the American vocabulary, the best conditions are the boss's biggest profits, the worker's most thorough enslavement, and the greatest chaos and disillusionment in society." (Both quoted from *Sunday After the War*, p. 13.) However, he does not think too much about his rights as a human being. Perhaps it is out of helplessness, perhaps it is "habitual." He compares himself to a dog:

    "I fell asleep. I dreamed that I was a dog, with a blue silk ribbon tied around my neck, participating in a dog show. …

    "…My owner bent down, grabbed my ears, lifted my mouth, and kissed my nose and said, 'I know you will win the award for me,' she whispered. 'You are such a lovely fellow.' She began to stroke my fur. 'Wait a minute, dear, I'll give you something good to eat. Wait a minute…'

    "She took out a small paper bag, tied with silk rope. She held it up in front of me, and I raised my front legs and barked incessantly.

    "…

    "The bag was almost open at this time. She hid the gift behind her.

    "'Bye-bye…that's right, bye-bye!'

    "Woof woof! I was so happy that my heart almost jumped out of my throat.

    "Suddenly, she showed it in front of my eyes. It was a lovely bone, full of marrow, with a gold wedding ring wrapped around it. I was eager to grab it. But she held it higher than my head, cruelly tempting me. Finally, unexpectedly, she stuck out her tongue and began to suck the marrow into her own mouth. Then, she turned around and sucked the other side. When she had sucked a hole in the middle of the bone, she stroked me again. She stroked me so appropriately that I became as dull as a raw carrot." (*Sunday After the War*, p. 177.)

    This is, of course, Miller's satire of himself, but it is also a satire of those "masters"—the American gold dollar rulers—and their despicable tricks. Of course, this kind of satire is powerless, because the "masters" can generously throw down the marrow-filled bone. As for themselves, they have better food.

    Miller's satire is precisely Miller's sorrow!

    America, this nightmare! In this nightmare, people become dogs, and dogs bite people. Is it to continue to be a dog in this nightmare, or to wake up and break this nightmare? This is precisely a historical problem for all American petty-bourgeois intellectuals like Miller.

　　美国，这个噩梦！
    米勒自己的诅咒
    萧乾
    美国作家玛蒂逊自杀了。这是可以理解的。法西斯化的杜鲁门政权疯狂地对外侵略，对内压迫，恰恰是表现了美帝的接近死亡，美国资本主义社会秩序的动摇崩溃的日益加剧。在这样环境下，寄生在这个社会秩序上的美国文学艺术界，其苦闷是必然日益深刻，其分化也是必然日益明朗的。要么是投降，要么是更坚决果敢地战斗下去；彷徨顾盼，良心难泯而认识又不足的话，就有走上玛蒂逊的悲惨道路的可能。我因此想到曾经“进步的”写过《愤怒的葡萄》的斯坦培克，写过《千钧一发》的怀德尔，也想到亨利·米勒（Henry Miller）。
    米勒，这个掘过坟墓、当过酒馆跑堂、推销过人寿保险、检过垃圾、行过乞的流浪汉，曾经用浓烈的笔致，描绘和诅咒了他的遭罹；尽管他的立场是动摇的，甚至荒唐的，但是通过那些诅咒，读者对现实的不满得到若干发泄，于是米勒也就红到大西洋两岸，而拥有众多的读者。
    米勒的十几本小说、游记和杂文之中，《夏至线》一书是最震动一时的，曾被誉为一九二二年《悠莱赛斯》出版以来英美资产阶级文坛的一个“了不起”的收获。这是一本和《悠莱赛斯》一样不好懂的“天书”，是一本展览和抚摸资产阶级身上的癞疮的“脏书”。它写的是比地狱还阴惨的巴黎下层社会——妓女，流浪汉，穷，病，偷，梅毒，大便……脏得如此之不堪入目，以致一出版就遭受禁止——而这自然是官样文章，毋宁说是替它作了更有力的宣传，让偷印的书商赚取更多的利润罢了。这样把资本主义社会的丑态写得淋漓尽致的作品，自然也不是英美统治阶级的光荣或愉快，然而我们却也不能称之为对资本主义社会的“暴露”。恰切地说，它是资本主义垂死期的文学艺术走到山穷水尽的地步之后的产物。它是资产阶级在道德上极度堕落的反映。日暮途穷的资产阶级文学已经再没有什么可以吸引读者的东西了，于是只好拿出侦探故事，谋杀案，色情，和一切的“脏”——生理的脏，心理的脏，以至字典上查不出的脏字。米勒尽管自以为只是客观地描绘了“现实”，其实却是担任了一个并不光荣的角色——十足做了资产阶级思想意识的俘虏。
    虽然如此，在分赃永远不匀的美国资本主义社会里，穷困出身的米勒并不是容易跟金圆统治者完全融洽无间的。反之，他是牢骚满腹。于是他发出了他的诅咒。例如他在匹茨堡一家旅馆里住着的时候说——
    “我如果在这屋子里继续住下去，我不是发疯，就得自杀。这地方的鬼魂，这个丑恶的城市的建造者的鬼魂在墙上忽隐忽现，活像是想谋杀谁。我窒息得吐不出气来。
    “我出去吸了口新鲜空气。我恍然回到了沙皇时代的俄罗斯。我望见可怕的伊凡，后面跟着一大串翘起鼻子的畜生们。……只要望他们一眼就足够使人想发动革命；我多么想把他们从飞跃的马上拖下来，把他们那笨重的头颅重重敲它几下。我多么想把这种‘法律与秩序’给粉碎了。”（《战后的星期日》页七。）
    米勒的“想”自然只是想想而已。但从他的愤懑中却也可以窥见美国“那间屋子”是怎样使人“窒息”了。
    尽管美帝自己及其世界主义的爪牙们如何吹嘘“美国文明”、“美国文化”，而其实在这窒息得使人发疯使人自杀的“屋子”里，“文明”正是二十世纪的登峰造极的“野蛮”，“文化”正是一片空虚的沙漠。甚至担任了没落资产阶级的思想意识的俘虏这样角色的米勒，也不得不忿然地而又悲哀地承认：
    “整个出版界就没有一个大无畏的真理战士。没有一家影片公司是着眼在艺术，而不在金钱。我们就没有配叫做剧院的剧院，而我们所有的剧院差不多全麕集在一个城市里。除了黑人给我们的以外，我们就没有自己的音乐。有创造力的作家数不上十名。我们公共建筑中的壁画，其审美的水平相当于中学生，也许还不如。我们的博物馆是堆满了死沉沉的破古董。我们在方场上建筑的那些纪念碑足以使死者在墓中辗转不安。我们对建筑的欣赏力已经低落到零点。……所有曾经是美的，重要的，有前途的，都埋没在我们这虚伪进步的狂崩之下了。欧洲一千年不息的战争所损毁的，也不及我们一百年的‘和平与进步’。”（《战后的星期日》，页一五。）
    这样的估计出于米勒之口，是决不会有丝毫夸大的。
    在另外一处，他的诅咒甚至带了更多的批判性，虽然立场是含糊的，但是几乎触到了美国反动社会秩序的核心。
    “我们号称世界上产量最大的国家，但是我们国内三分之一以上的人口吃不饱，穿不暖，没有地方住。大片的土地由于漠视，贪婪和破坏而荒芜着。八十年前，我们国内打过人类史上一场血仗，然而我们直到今天也没能说明我们为什么而打那场仗。作为奴隶解放者，我们并没有给奴隶们以真的自由平等；同时，我们却使白种人同样沦为奴隶。对了，工业的北方击败了贵族的南方——胜利的果实是历历在目。但是那里有工业，那里便有丑恶、贫苦、压迫、黯淡和绝望。银行整天教训我们去储蓄，他们好发旺；结果把我们的钱袋骗光了，他们还恫吓说：如果不听他们的吩咐，就连眼前这点利息也取消了。世界存金四分之三埋在肯塔基洲的地下。多少发明是束在专利局的高阁上，或为控制我们命运的那些势力买去毁掉了，因为在我们这个滑稽的制度下，所有可能造福人类的好事都能成为祸患。在人口稀疏的土地上，大量生产着种种过剩的物品，掌握所有权的极少数人认为不但不能容纳千百万欧洲饥民，即我们自己的大队饥民也无从置足。再可笑莫如我们把传教士派到地球辽远的角落，向穷人们一个铜板一个铜板募得款子来维持这些蒙了心的魔鬼们（其实他们之不代表基督，正如我不是教皇），而那些教会却不能在自己家里拯救一下孱弱，孤苦，和被压迫的。我们的医院，疯人院和监狱都挤得水泄不通。无影无形的企业组合拥有着大如有些欧洲国家的城镇，里面差不多一个人也不住。这些企业组合的触手无孔不入地散布全国，谁也不能规定或明确说出它们的责任。一个人在纽约或旧金山坐在安乐椅上，周围有的是种种奢侈，也有的是恐怖和忧虑。
    “这个人竟控制了千万他所从未见过，也不想会见的男女的生命和前途，而对于那些男女的命运他是漠不关心的。
    “这就是一九四一年美利坚合众国的进步。我既然没有红印度人，黑人，或墨西哥人的血统，我这样描绘白人文明的图景，自己并不能得到什么出了气的愉快。我的祖先是因为不愿意当兵而由其生地（德国）逃出的。说来滑稽，我的后裔们却逃不开那个兵役了；整个白人世界将成为一个兵营。”（《战后的星期日》页一○）
    一点不错，问题在于美国那个“制度”——并不是什么“滑稽的”制度，而是一个血腥的万恶的制度。那么怎么办呢？米勒却没有进一步正视事实而作出答案的勇气。他像一切撒谎者一样，唱起什么“世界末日”的老调头来作为他的解答。在他的《不冷不暖的噩梦》一书中（页一三四，“阿堪萨斯及大金字塔”），他想像了世界末日的来临。“滑稽的”是他又想像了一座金字塔——由好心的主角哈威其人者募集了几万金元建立起来的——其中保存了“人类文明”的精华，垂之永久。金元万竟能在米勒的“末日”也有所表现了！
    米勒的愤懑之所以无力，正因为他在基本上没有跳出金圆的魔掌。他明知道在美国“即使在最好的条件下工作，一个工人也得出卖他所有做人的权利。”“在美国字汇中，最好的条件就是老板最大的利润，工人最彻底的奴化，和社会上最大的混乱与幻灭。”（俱见《战后的星期日》，页十三。）然而他并不太多考虑自己的做人的权利。也许是出于无奈，也许竟是“习惯成自然”了。他把自己比作一条狗：
    “我睡着了。我梦见我是一条狗，脖子上扎了一根蓝绸带子，参加着狗展。……
    “……我的主人低下身来，抓住我的耳朵，托起我的嘴，亲着我的鼻子说：‘我知道你一定会替我争到奖状的，’她低声说。‘你是这样可爱的一个家伙。’她开始抚摸我的毛。‘等一等，乖，我给你点好东西吃。等一会……”
    “她拿出一个小纸包来，上面用丝绳捆着。她把它在我面前举起，我就举起前腿，汪汪吠个不住。
    “……
    “包儿这时差不多已经打开。她把礼物隐在她背后。
    “‘拜拜呀……对了，拜拜！’
    “汪汪！我高兴得心快跳出了窍。
    “忽然，她把那个晃在我的眼前了。那是一块可爱的骨头，里面满是骨髓，上面还缠了一只金的结婚戒指。我急于抓到它。但是她把它举得比头还高，残忍地馋着我。最后，出乎我意料之外，她把舌头伸出，开始把骨髓吮到她自己嘴里。然后，又掉过来吮那一边。等她把骨头中间咂出一个窟窿时，她又抚摸起我来。她抚摸得那么恰当，不一刻我呆得如一根生胡萝卜了。”（《战后的星期日》，页一七七。）
    这固然是米勒对自己的讽刺，但也是对那些“主人”们——美国金圆统治者们的卑鄙技俩的讽刺。当然这种讽刺是没有力量的，因为“主人”们尽可以把带髓的骨头慷慨掷下。至于他们自己，更好的食品有的是呢。
    米勒的讽刺也正是米勒的悲哀！
    美国，这个噩梦！在这个噩梦里，人变成狗，狗撕咬着人。是在这噩梦里做狗做下去呢，还是觉醒起来打破这个噩梦呢？这正是米勒之流的一切美国小资产阶级知识分子当前的一个历史难题。
