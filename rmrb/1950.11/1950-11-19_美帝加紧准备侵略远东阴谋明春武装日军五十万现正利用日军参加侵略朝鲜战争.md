Xinhua News Agency, 18th: US imperialism's conspiracy to revive Japanese militarism for aggression in the Far East is being intensified. According to a report by the Den-etsu News Agency from Manila on the 17th: A Den-etsu reporter learned from sources close to MacArthur that US imperialism is preparing to establish a 500,000-strong Japanese army by next spring. The source who revealed the information to Den-etsu quoted MacArthur as saying that Japan's current 200,000-strong police force is a "good start" to building a more powerful army that the United States intends to use in its Far East war plan. At the same time, the source also revealed that so far, three Japanese state-owned arms factories have started production under the guidance of the American occupation authorities. The "Sagamihara" tank factory's production has almost reached pre-war levels. The production of the Ishikawa Island Tank Factory and the various factories of the Kanebo Diesel Engine Company is also approaching pre-war levels. Most of the tanks manufactured by these factories are being handed over to the US military, Japanese police forces, and other military organizations fighting in Korea. Mitsubishi Trust and Koyo Precision Industries are supplying long-range artillery to US forces in Korea. The majority of the production of Japan Nitrogen (Nitrogen Gas) and Japan Soda (Soda) Chemical Factories is for the manufacture of ammunition for the US military in Asia.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th: TASS Shanghai, 17th dispatch from Tokyo: American authorities are restoring the Japanese aggressive army under the guise of the so-called "National Police Reserve." According to Japan United News Agency, in Kyoto Prefecture, the Police Reserve is concentrating at Maizuru Port. The morale of the personnel of these troops is very low, and many complain to railway workers that they have been deceived. A sergeant in the Police Reserve told his family that he would soon be transported to "somewhere," which means Korea.

According to Asahi Shimbun, Justice Minister Takeo Ohashi pointed out that former Japanese military officers whose rights have recently been restored may be appointed as commanders in the reserve force. Asahi Shimbun admitted that the reserve force is being trained under the supervision of the American occupation authorities.

Xinhua News Agency, 18th: TASS New York, 15th: "Chicago Daily News" correspondent in Tokyo, Beecher, has published a series of articles exposing the US policy of militarizing Japan and MacArthur's extensive use of Japan in the war of aggression against the Korean people. Beecher pointed out: "Japan is already a fully-fledged ally of the United States."

Beecher continued: "Without Japanese help, we (referring to the United States) might have been driven out of Korea. It is no exaggeration to say that. When ships were in dire need, those landing craft equipped with Japanese personnel helped transport the first batch of US troops to Korea. In July, the Japanese helped transport the entire 1st Cavalry Division to Pohang. At that time, reinforcement troops were critical to success or failure; the arrival of reinforcements could provide support, otherwise, the entire army would be wiped out. Nineteen ships participating in the Inchon landing in mid-September were manned entirely by Japanese crew. Japanese minesweepers have been clearing mines along the Korean coast. US military meteorological stations are staffed by Japanese personnel, and the Japanese also serve as armed guards for US military agencies. Many Japanese are doing unpaid overtime work in the occupation forces' agencies. Japanese industry has already manufactured more than $140 million worth of military supplies for the military, demonstrating its war potential. Orders continue to pour in, including various military supplies, from burlap sacks for sandbags to railway cars."

Beecher further said: The Japanese Police Reserve actually constitutes 75,000 American-trained troops. It can be turned into an army with just a single order. "Japan is secretly preparing for war under American leadership," and "is being rearmed by its conqueror." MacArthur had already created the core of the new Japanese army four months ago, ostensibly called the "National Police Reserve." Now they are being trained in thirty-one training camps. "More than half of the reserve force are veterans who participated in the last war. Many have fought in the Philippines, Burma, and China. They don't need much training, just a physical examination. Among them, 5,000 are former officers. Two weeks ago, MacArthur Headquarters de-purged more than 3,000 professional officers, making them available for recruitment. These professional soldiers are eager to return to the army, and many immediately joined the Police Reserve."

Beecher continued: "The Police Reserve is desperately trying to make themselves look like they are not an army, but it's all in vain. New recruits wearing tan uniforms are now appearing on the streets in large numbers, acting more like soldiers than police officers. The reserve force is imitating the US military in almost every aspect, with six officers per company. The US military's field manuals have been translated into Japanese for basic training. New recruits undergo standard drills in a thirteen-week basic training course, including physical education, reconnaissance, and patrols. In many cases, the reserve force is utilizing the camp facilities vacated by those US troops currently being deployed to Korea. Six thousand people are being trained in a US military training camp in northern Honshu. The facilities of the US military school in Etajima (the former Japanese naval academy near Hiroshima) have been transferred to new recruits for use. The place is also an officer training institution. The first class of 370 graduates were almost all reserve officers from the former Japanese army.

"Up to now, the reserve force has only been armed with American carbines. However, they have been ordered to use US military weapons, from machine guns to 155mm howitzers. Police Reserve Commander Keiji Masuhara told me that future training programs will include tank combat and the use of 57mm anti-tank guns. MacArthur's spokesman said: "There are no plans to issue the reserve force with any weapons larger than carbines. However, no one doubts that if necessary, all US military equipment can be used immediately, and the Japanese certainly do not doubt this." Masuhara Keiji said: "If Japan is allowed to rearm and the constitution is amended, then it will be easier to turn the Police Reserve into an army." With just one order, the director-general of the Police Reserve can be immediately turned into an army colonel of equivalent rank. "It wouldn't take much effort to turn the reserve force into an army; the Japanese themselves already regard themselves as an army."

　　美帝加紧准备侵略远东阴谋明春武装日军五十万现正利用日军参加侵略朝鲜战争
    【新华社十八日讯】美帝国主义恢复日本武装以侵略远东的阴谋，正加紧进行中。据电通社马尼拉十七日讯：电通社记者自接近麦克阿瑟的人士获悉，美帝国主义准备在明年春季成立一支五十万人的日本军队。向电通社透露消息的这位人士引述麦克阿瑟的话说：目前日本的二十万警察部队，是建立美国在远东作战计划中打算使用的更强大的军队的“良好开端”。同时，该方面人士又透露，迄今已有三家日本国营军备工厂在美国占领当局的指导下开工。“相模原”坦克制造厂的生产已几乎达到战前的水平。石川岛坦克制造厂和钟渊柴油机公司的各个工厂的生产，也快要接近战前水平了。这些工厂所制造出的大多数坦克，正交给在朝鲜作战的美军、日本警察部队和其他军事组织。三菱托辣斯和光洋精密工业公司，则正以它们所制造的长射程大炮供给美国在朝鲜的部队。日本窒素（氮气）和日本曹达（苏打）化学工厂绝大部分的生产，都是为美国在亚洲的军队制造弹药。
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社上海十七日电引东京消息称：美国当局正在所谓“国家警察后备队”的掩饰下恢复日本的侵略军队。日本联合通信社消息说，在京都县，警察后备队正集中在舞鹤港。这些部队的人员情绪甚为低落，许多人向铁路工人抱怨说他们受骗了。警察后备队的一个警士告他的家庭说，不久他将被运往“某地”，那就是说朝鲜。
    据朝日新闻说，法务总裁大桥武夫指出，最近恢复权利的前日军军官或将被任命为后备队中的司令官。朝日新闻承认后备队正在美国占领当局的监督下受训。
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社纽约十五日讯：“芝加哥每日新闻”驻东京记者比区，连续发表几篇文章，暴露出美国使日本军国主义化的政策，以及麦克阿瑟广泛利用日本对朝鲜人民进行侵略战争的实况。比区指出：“日本已经是美国的羽毛丰满的盟国了。”
    比区接着说：“如果没有日本帮助，我们（按指美国）也许已被逐出朝鲜。说这句话，决不是夸张。当船舶痛感缺乏的时候，配置着日本人的那些登陆艇，曾帮同将第一批美军运送到朝鲜去。在七月间，日本人曾帮同将第一骑兵师全部人马运送到浦项去，当时增援部队是成败所系，援军开到就可以支撑，否则就要全军覆没。在九月中旬参加仁川登陆侵入战的舰艇，有十九艘的船员全是日本人。日本扫雷艇一直在清除朝鲜沿海的水雷。美军气象观测站配置着日本人员，日本人并且为美军机关充当武装警卫队。许多日本人在占领军的机关中担任无偿的逾时的额外工作。日本工业已为军队制造出价值一亿四千万美元以上的军用品，由此显示出它的战争潜能。定货单还源源不断地涌来，包括各种军用品，从沙袋用的麻布袋一直到铁路车厢。”
    比区进一步说：日本警察后备队实际上已构成七万五千名的美国训练的部队。只要一纸命令就可以把它变成陆军了。“日本在美国领导下，暗地里准备着战争”，而且“正被它的征服者重新武装起来。”麦克阿瑟在四个月前就已创立了日本新陆军的核心，表面上叫做“国家警察后备队”。现在他们在三十一处教练营中受训。“后备队中有半数以上的人都是曾参加上次战争的老战士。许多人曾在菲律宾、缅甸和中国参加过战斗。他们不需要受什么训练，只要举行一次体格检查就行了。他们中间有五千人是过去的军官。两星期前，麦克阿瑟总部将三千多名职业军官解除整肃，这么一来就使他们也可以录用了。这些职业军人渴望回到军队里去，有许多人立刻投身警察后备队。”
    比区继续说：“警察后备队拚命想使他们看起来不像陆军，但是白费心机。穿着茶褐色军装的新兵，现在一大批一大批地出现在街头，一举一动更像大兵而不像警察。后备队差不多在各方面都是仿效美军，每连有六个军官。美军的野战操典已译成日文，以供基本教练之用。新兵在十三个星期的基本训练班受标准的操练，包括体育、侦察和巡逻。在许多场合，后备队都利用目前开拔到朝鲜去的那些美军所空下来的营地设备。六千人正在本州岛北部的美军一个教导营内受着训练。江田岛地方的美军学校（广岛附近前日本海军学校）中的设备，已移交新兵使用。该地也是军官训练机关。第一班毕业的三百七十名军官，差不多都是前日本陆军中的后备军官。
    到现在为止，后备队还只是用美国卡宾枪武装。但是，他们已奉到命令，可以使用美军武器，从机关枪到一五五公厘的榴弹炮。警察后备队长官增原惠吉对我说：将来训练的方案将包括坦克战斗和五七公厘平射炮使用法。麦克阿瑟的发言人说过：“不打算以比卡宾枪更大的任何武器发给后备队。然而，如果到了必要的时候，所有一切美国兵器就立刻可以利用，这一点是没有一个人会怀疑的，日本人更不怀疑。”增原惠吉说：“如果准许日本重新武装起来，修改宪法，那么，把警察后备队变成陆军就比较容易了。”只要一纸命令，就可以将警察后备队的一级总监，立刻变成同等军阶的陆军大佐了。“不必怎么费事就可以将后备队变成了陆军，那些日本人自己已以陆军自居了。”
