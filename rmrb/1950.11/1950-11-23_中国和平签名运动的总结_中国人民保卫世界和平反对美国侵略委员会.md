　　A summary of the China Peace Signature Campaign
    China Peace Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression
    The China Peace Declaration Signature Campaign has victoriously and basically concluded nationwide. As of November 16, the day the World Peace Congress opened in Warsaw, the total number of peace signatures nationwide was 223,739,545, accounting for approximately 47 percent of the total national population. Among these, the Northeast Region had 31,526,968 signatures, the North China Region had 39,567,091, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region had 1,485,113, the East China Region had 62,328,789, the Northwest Region had 11,260,931, the Central South Region had 58,213,303, the Southwest Region had 18,681,205, and other regions had 676,145.
    The process of the Chinese people conducting the peace signature campaign can be divided into three stages:
    The first stage (mid-May to the end of June): Organized masses in general cities were mobilized and preparations were made for carrying out the peace signature campaign. During this period, 28 branches and sub-branches of the China Peace Conference to Defend World Peace were established in major cities across the country. These branches, together with local people's organizations, democratic parties, government agencies, and troops, conducted propaganda and launched the signature drive, enabling the vast majority of organized masses in major cities to sign. The total number of signatures in this stage was 26,710,000.
    The second stage (early July to mid-August): The Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference passed measures calling on the people of the whole country to launch a signature campaign to defend world peace on June 23, and designated July 1 to 7 as the Week for Peace Declaration Signature Campaign. On June 25, American imperialism launched a war of aggression in Korea, massively slaughtering the Korean people, and then announced that it would use its navy to prevent our country from liberating Taiwan. In order to respond to the World Federation of Trade Unions' "Week to Support the Korean People," the China Peace Committee to Defend World Peace and other people's organizations jointly organized the "China People's Committee to Oppose American Aggression against Taiwan and Korea," and called on all parts of the country to hold the "Week of Movement to Oppose American Aggression against Taiwan and Korea" starting from July 17. The vigorous development of the movement against American aggression carried out an effective political education for the Chinese people, enabling the Chinese people to further recognize the true face of American aggressors and further understand the importance of fighting to defend world peace, thus pushing China's peace signature campaign to a new stage. People of all nationalities and strata across the country participated in the Peace Declaration Signature Campaign more and more enthusiastically. At the end of July, the number of signatures for the Peace Declaration suddenly increased to more than 50 million, and on August 26, it increased to 86 million. This was more than twice the number of signatures at the end of June.
    The third stage (mid-August and beyond): Disregarding the opposition of the people of the world, American imperialism continued to expand its aggression against Korea. The China and Great Committee issued a call on August 13 to "expand the peace signature campaign and strive for 200 million people to participate in the signature campaign," and the peace signature campaign developed further. At the end of August, American planes invading Korea began to provoke our country, constantly conducting reconnaissance, strafing, and bombing our Northeast. This aggressive action by the United States proved that the United States was deliberately expanding the war of aggression further to Chinese territory, thus further arousing the Chinese people's anger at American aggression. Driven by patriotic sentiment, the number of signatures rose rapidly, reaching more than 175,690,000 by October 10, and increasing to more than 223,730,000 by the middle of this month.
    China's peace signature campaign demonstrated the following three characteristics:
    First, the people who participated in the signature included people from all regions, all ethnic groups, all classes, and all different beliefs and occupations in the country, including workers, farmers, staff members of the people's government, commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, industrialists and businessmen, youths, women, students, artists, writers, scientists, other urban residents, religious figures, etc. This shows that the will of the Chinese people to oppose wars of aggression and uphold world peace is unanimous throughout the country.
    Second, this signature campaign was closely integrated with the Chinese people's struggle against American imperialism's aggression against China and Korea. The fact that American imperialism invaded China and Korea profoundly educated the Chinese people, making them realize that only by actively opposing imperialist aggression is it the most effective struggle to defend world peace. During the signature campaign, the Chinese people held the "Week of Movement to Oppose American Aggression against Taiwan and Korea." Recently, the "China Peace Committee to Defend World Peace" and the "China People's Committee to Oppose American Aggression against Taiwan and Korea" were merged and reorganized into the "China Peace Committee to Defend World Peace and Oppose American Aggression" in order to more closely link the Chinese people's struggle to defend world peace and oppose American aggression.
    Third, this peace signature campaign was combined with large-scale current affairs propaganda work. All parts of the country mobilized a large amount of manpower and used various forms to carry out current affairs propaganda to the people, enabling the people to further understand the aggressive crimes of American imperialism and the principle that American imperialism can be completely defeated, and improving their determination and confidence in fighting against imperialism. The people of the whole country attended a political class in this peace signature campaign. This peace signature campaign has provided many good experiences for large-scale current affairs propaganda work in the future.
    The Chinese peace signature campaign achieved the result of more than 223 million people signing, which is a major contribution to the cause of world peace and a major demonstration against imperialist war mongers. It is something that imperialist war mongers fear that China, with its 475 million people, expresses its great will to resolutely oppose wars of aggression and defend world peace.
    In the future, the Chinese people will continue to wage unremitting struggles against imperialist aggression and to defend world peace. The movement to resist America, aid Korea, protect our homes, and defend our country recently launched by the Chinese people is a powerful action by the Chinese people to resolutely oppose imperialist aggression and defend world peace. With the firm efforts of the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world, the imperialists' war plans will surely be crushed, and the cause of world peace and democracy will eventually triumph.

### 中国和平签名运动的总结  中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会

　　中国和平签名运动的总结
    中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会
    中国的和平宣言签名运动已经在全国范围内胜利地基本结束了。到十一月十六日世界保卫和平大会在华沙开幕这一天为止，全国和平签名人数共计二亿二千三百七十三万九千五百四十五人，约占全国总人口的百分之四十七。其中东北区三千一百五十二万六千九百六十八人，华北区三千九百五十六万七千零九十一人，内蒙自治区一百四十八万五千一百十三人，华东区六千二百三十二万八千七百八十九人，西北区一千一百二十六万零九百三十一人，中南区五千八百二十一万三千三百零三人，西南区一千八百六十八万一千二百零五人，及其他六十七万六千一百四十五人。
    中国人民进行和平签名运动的过程，可分为三个阶段：
    第一阶段（五月中旬至六月底）：一般城市中有组织的群众都动员起来了，并作好了开展和平签名运动的准备工作。在这段期间，全国各大城市成立了二十八个中国保卫世界和平大会的分、支会，这些分支会与当地人民团体、民主党派及政府机关、部队一起进行宣传，发动了签名，使各大城市有组织的群众的绝大部分都签了名。这一阶段签名人数总计为二千六百七十一万。
    第二阶段（七月初至八月中旬）：六月二十三日中国人民政协全国委员会第二次会议通过号召全国人民展开保卫世界和平签名运动的办法，并定七月一日至七日为和平宣言签名运动周。六月二十五日美帝国主义在朝鲜发动侵略战争，大规模屠杀朝鲜人民，接着又宣布以海军阻止我国解放台湾。中国保卫世界和平大会委员会和其他人民团体为了响应世界工联的“支援朝鲜人民周”，共同组织了“中国人民反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动委员会”，并号召全国各地自七月十七日起举行“反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动周”。反对美国侵略运动的蓬勃开展，对全国人民进行了一次有效的政治教育，使中国人民更加认识了美国侵略者的真面貌，并进一步了解了为保卫世界和平而斗争的重要性，因而把中国的和平签名运动推上了一个新阶段。全国各民族、各阶层人民愈来愈踊跃地参加和平宣言签名运动。七月底，和平宣言签名人数即突增至五千万人以上，八月二十六日，又增至八千六百万人。比六月底签名人数增加了二倍以上。
    第三阶段（八月中旬以后）：美帝国主义不顾世界人民的反对，继续扩大对朝鲜的侵略。中国和大委员会于八月十三日发出了“扩大和平签名运动，争取两万万人参加签名”的号召，和平签名运动更向前发展。八月底美国侵略朝鲜的飞机开始向我国挑衅，不断侦察、扫射和轰炸我国东北。美国的这种侵略行动证明美国蓄意把侵略战争进一步扩大到中国领土，因而更加激起中国人民对美国侵略的愤怒。在爱国情绪的推动下，签名人数迅速上升，至十月十日，即已达一亿七千五百六十九万余人，至本月中旬，又增加为二亿二千三百七十三万多人。
    中国的和平签名运动，表现了下面三个特点：
    第一，参加签名的人包括了全国各个地区、各个民族、各个阶层和各种不同信仰、不同职业的人民，其中有工人、农民、人民政府的工作人员、人民解放军的指战员、工商业者、青年、妇女、学生、艺术家、文学家、科学家、城市其他居民、宗教界人士等。这表示中国人民反对侵略战争、拥护世界和平的意志是全国一致的。
    第二，这一签名运动是和中国人民反对美帝国主义侵略中国和朝鲜的斗争密切结合在一起的。美帝国主义侵略中国和朝鲜的事实深刻教育了中国人民，使中国人民认识了只有积极反对帝国主义侵略才是保卫世界和平的最有效的斗争。在签名运动中，中国人民曾举行了“反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动周”。最近，“中国保卫世界和平大会委员会”和“中国人民反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动委员会”合并改组为“中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会”，也就是为了使中国人民保卫世界和平的斗争和反对美国侵略的斗争更紧密地联系起来。
    第三，这次和平签名运动是和大规模的时事宣传工作结合进行的。全国各地都动员了大量人力，用各种形式向人民进行了时事宣传，使人民进一步认识了美帝国主义的侵略罪行和美帝国主义完全可以打败的道理，提高了对帝国主义斗争的决心和信心。全国人民都在这次和平签名运动中上了一次政治课。这次和平签名运动已为今后的大规模时事宣传工作提供了不少好的经验。
    这次中国和平签名运动取得了二亿二千三百多万人签名的成绩，这对于世界和平事业是一个重大的贡献，是对于帝国主义战争贩子的一次大示威。有着四亿七千五百万人民的中国表示坚决反侵略战争保卫世界和平的伟大意志，这是帝国主义战争贩子们所害怕的事。
    中国人民今后将继续为反对帝国主义侵略、保卫世界和平而进行坚持不懈的斗争。中国人民最近发起的抗美援朝保家卫国运动，就是中国人民坚决反对帝国主义侵略和保卫世界和平的一个有力行动，在中朝两国人民和全世界人民的坚决努力下，帝国主义的战争计划是一定会被粉碎的，世界和平民主事业是终于会胜利的。
