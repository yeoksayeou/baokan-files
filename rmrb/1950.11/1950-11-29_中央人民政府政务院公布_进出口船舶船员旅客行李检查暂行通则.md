Xinhua News Agency, 28th. Provisional General Rules for Inspection of Entry/Exit Ships, Crew Members, Passengers, and Luggage (Promulgated by the Government Administration Council on November 27, 1950)

1.  These General Rules are formulated to unify the inspection of entry/exit ships, crew members, passengers, and luggage, to ensure navigation safety, maintain national border security, suppress smuggling, and prevent the spread of epidemics.

2.  The following authorities may conduct inspections of entry/exit ships, crew members, passengers, and luggage within their respective areas of responsibility:
    (1) Port Authority (or the Navigation Authority in ports without a Port Authority): Responsible for inspecting ship documents, crew certificates, nautical logs, ship equipment, and other matters related to ship navigation safety.
    (2) Customs: Responsible for inspecting luggage and items carried by passengers and crew members, as well as searching ships, in connection with the suppression of smuggling. Individual inspections may be conducted on crew members and passengers suspected of smuggling.
    (3) Public Security Bureau: Inspects passengers' passports, documents, manifests, and, in coordination with Customs, inspects passengers' luggage and items carried by disembarking crew members. If necessary, may conduct individual inspections of suspicious passengers or crew members.
    (4) Quarantine Authority: Responsible for inspecting crew members' and passengers' for diseases, ship hygiene facilities, and related vaccinations, cargo disinfection, ship fumigation, pest and rodent control, and certificates.

    No other authorities may conduct inspections without special approval from the Government Administration Council.

3.  Permission for ships to enter or exit ports shall be handled uniformly by the Port Authority. Other authorities shall not detain ships on any pretext. If there is a special reason to prohibit entry or delay exit, it must be executed through the Port Authority. The Port Authority is responsible for notifying the relevant inspection authorities of the ship's entry/exit time and berthing location, so that joint inspections can be carried out in a step-by-step and orderly manner, in accordance with the provisions of Article 2. Whether for entry or exit inspections, one inspection should be the principle unless there are special circumstances.

4.  Upon a ship's entry, in accordance with quarantine regulations, the Quarantine Authority shall first assign personnel to board the ship to conduct quarantine. Then, inspection personnel from other authorities shall simultaneously board the ship to conduct a joint inspection.

5.  After a ship arrives at a port or before a ship departs, the captain shall fill out a list of crew members and passengers and submit it to the Port Authority for distribution to the relevant inspection authorities. Other inspection authorities shall not directly request it from the ship.

6.  The inspection of ships, crew members, and passengers is limited to the port of departure, port of arrival, and ports of call en route. Without special or suspicious circumstances, no authority may stop a ship mid-voyage for inspection.

7.  The inspection of foreign diplomatic personnel shall be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government.

8.  Chinese crew members disembarking shall hold a seaman's book issued by the Port Authority or a membership card from the Chinese Seamen's Union, proving that they are indeed working on the ship; otherwise, they must have a certificate signed by the captain. Foreign crew members disembarking shall have a landing permit, which shall be uniformly printed and issued by the Public Security Bureau, numbered according to the number of foreign crew members on each ship, issued by the captain at one time, approved by the Public Security Bureau with a time limit, and collected by the captain and returned in full before the ship departs.

9.  In principle, Chinese ships sailing on inland rivers and along the coast shall not be subject to inspection. However, in one of the following circumstances, the relevant authorities may still conduct inspections through the Port Authority:
    (1) When the Public Security Bureau believes there is a special situation requiring inspection upon a ship's entry or exit.
    (2) When Customs believes an inspection is necessary in areas with serious smuggling or when there is suspicion of smuggling.
    (3) When the Quarantine Authority believes an inspection is necessary for ships arriving from or departing to plague ports, or when there is an epidemic or death on board.

10. The Port Authority shall be responsible for periodically convening joint inspection meetings at each port, with the participation of representatives from the Quarantine, Customs, and Public Security departments, and representatives from the Seamen's Union. Representatives from other relevant authorities may be invited to attend as necessary to discuss issues arising in the inspection work and to study and discuss how to unify procedures, divide labor, cooperate, and simplify procedures. The joint inspection meeting shall have a secretary who handles daily affairs under the leadership of the Port Authority.

11. The term "inspection" in these General Rules refers to the items listed in Article 2. Other regulations, such as those of the Port Authority for managing ships and those of Customs for supervising, inspecting, and levying taxes on freight, shall still be handled by the respective competent authorities in accordance with their regulations.

12. The term "port" in these General Rules is limited to international navigable ports designated by the Central People's Government.

13. After these General Rules are promulgated and implemented, any existing joint inspection organizations and methods in various localities that conflict with these General Rules shall be abolished.
