Xinhua News Agency, November 24th dispatch: According to Vietnam News Agency's 20th dispatch, "Voice of Vietnam" radio station summarized the military situation in Vietnam, stating: In the six weeks leading up to the beginning of this month, the Vietnamese People's Army achieved significant victories in the Cao Bằng and Lạng Sơn areas, annihilating nine elite French battalions, and launching attacks on French colonial troops on other fronts. During this period, the People's Army liberated four provincial capitals (Cao Bằng, Lạng Sơn, Lào Cai, Hòa Bình), eighteen important cities, and thirty-four market towns.

In the Lào Cai and Hà Giang war zones, the People's Army eliminated ten French strongholds between September 20th and October 1st, including Bách Khê, Hồ Thanh, Bản Quảng, Nam Đô, Tân Sa Pả, Nậm Xé, Lao Chẩu, Sa Pa Khải, Sín Chải, and Hoàng Thu Phố. Due to the pressure from the People's Army, French troops withdrew from Lào Cai on November 2nd. Southwest of Hanoi, French troops were forced to withdraw from the Hòa Bình provincial capital and the outer strongholds between Hòa Bình and Ù Bông at the beginning of this month.

In the Việt Bắc area, the People's Armed Forces continuously attacked French transportation lines and intercepted French troops looting in the countryside. In the two weeks leading up to October 2nd, 400 French troops were killed or wounded, one French riverboat and one speedboat were sunk, five trucks were destroyed, and eight landing craft were captured. The People's Armed Forces also destroyed fifty-three puppet administrative organizations in the provinces of Bắc Giang and Bắc Ninh.

In the seven provinces of Sơn Tây, Hà Nam, etc., in the Red River Delta, the People's Army eliminated eighteen French strongholds between mid-September and early November.

In North-Central Vietnam, the People's Army attacked a French train north of Huế on October 26th, destroying fifteen carriages. In Central Vietnam, the People's Army eliminated five French strongholds and destroyed four trains in September, and also raided the port of Tourane on October 1st. In South Vietnam, the People's Army attacked French strongholds in Thủ Dầu Một province and Biên Hòa province north of Saigon in October, destroying five armored vehicles and trucks, and damaging several sections of the Saigon-Lộc Ninh railway.

Xinhua News Agency, November 24th dispatch: Simultaneously with expanding the Korean War of Aggression, U.S. imperialism is intensifying its intervention in Vietnam. According to a United Press Washington 19th dispatch: In the past two months, forty American small patrol boats have been shipped to Indochina. In addition, fifty aircraft and various types of tanks have been "transferred" to the French invading troops in Vietnam. "Other equipment is being rapidly shipped west from the West Coast to French and Indochinese troops."

To salvage their disastrous defeat in Vietnam, according to Agence France-Presse: Representatives of the French and the Bảo Đại puppet government held a meeting in Đà Lạt on the 4th of this month and reached an agreement to follow the dictates of U.S. imperialism and equip three divisions of puppet troops, totaling 30,000 men, next year. The officers in the puppet army will be filled by French officers, and the weapons and equipment will be "resolved with U.S. aid." In addition, the French colonialists are "exhausting all the manpower they can send," preparing to draw 4,000 "reinforcements" from France, North Africa, and other colonies to send to Vietnam to accelerate the organization and training of indigenous puppet troops. (United Press Paris 18th dispatch)

This measure reflects the contradictions between U.S. and French imperialism in the struggle for Vietnam, and also exposes the fatal weakness of the imperialist camp in expanding the war of aggression – the predicament of insufficient manpower. According to an Associated Press Washington dispatch: At the "U.S.-French Military Equipment Conference" in October, the United States insisted on handing over most of the weapons shipped to Vietnam directly to the Bảo Đại, Laos, and Cambodia puppet armies, with the aim of gradually excluding France and thus monopolizing Vietnam. In addition, the United States opposed France's dispatching reinforcements from its own country to Vietnam, because this would undermine the American "plan to establish the French army as the main European army in the Atlantic defense."

　　“越南之声”综述越南六周战局
     越人民军在越北获得重大胜利 
     解放四个省会十八个重要城市
    美帝加紧援法并扶植傀儡保大扩军
    【新华社二十四日讯】据越南通讯社二十日讯：“越南之声”电台综述越南军事局势称：到本月初为止的六周中，越南人民军曾在高平、谅山地区获得重大胜利，歼灭法军精锐九个营，并在其他各战线对法国殖民军展开攻击。在这期间，人民军解放四个省会（高平、谅山、老开、和平），十八个重要城市和三十四个集镇。
    在老开、河江战区，人民军在九月二十日至十月一日间拔除了十个法军据点，计有柏溪、胡清、邦广、南都、新沙培、南溪、老州、沙马开、申部、黄树菲。由于人民军的压力，法军于十一月二日退出老开。在河内西南，法军于本月初被迫撤出和平省会及和平与乌邦间的外围据点。
    在越北一带，人民武装不断袭击法军的交通线，截击下乡抢劫的法军。到十月二日为止的两周中，毙伤法军四百名，击沉法军内河船只及汽艇各一艘，击毁卡车五辆，缴获登陆艇八艘等。人民武装并在北江、北宁二省摧毁了五十三个伪行政机构。
    在红河流域的山西、河南等七省，人民军在九月中旬至十一月上旬，拔除法军据点十八处。
    在中越北部，人民军十月二十六日在顺化以北袭击法军火车一列，破坏车厢十五节。在中越南部，人民军在九月间拔除法军据点五处，破坏火车四列，并曾于十月一日突袭土伦港。在南越，人民军在十月间进攻西贡以北守油没省与边和省的法军据点，击毁装甲车、卡车五辆，并破坏西贡与禄宁间的路轨数处。
    【新华社二十四日讯】与扩大朝鲜侵略战争同时，美帝国主义正加紧对越南的干涉。据合众社华盛顿十九日讯：在过去二个月中，已有四十艘美国小型巡逻艇运抵印度支那。此外尚有五十架飞机和各种型式的战车“转让”给法国侵越部队。“其他装备正自西海岸迅速西运给法国及印度支那军队”。
    为挽救在越南的惨败，据法新社称：法国与保大傀儡政府代表已于本月四日在茶叻举行会议，并达成协议，决定遵从美帝意旨，在明年装备三个师伪军，总数三万人。伪军中的军官由法国军官充任，而武器装备则“将以美援解决”。此外，法国殖民者并“竭尽了它可派的一切人力”，准备从法国和北非以及其他殖民地中抽调四千“援军”派赴越南，以加速组织与训练土著伪军。（合众社巴黎十八日讯）
    这一措施反映了美、法帝国主义间争夺越南的矛盾，同时也暴露了帝国主义阵营扩大侵略战争致命的弱点——兵源不足的窘态。据美联社华盛顿消息透露：在十月间“美法军备会议”上，美国曾坚持要把运越的大部分武器直接交予保大、老挝和柬埔寨傀儡军队，目的在于逐渐排斥法国，从而独占越南。此外，美国并反对法国从国内抽派援军到越南，因为这将破坏美国“建立以法国陆军作为大西洋防御中欧洲的主要陆军的计划”。（合众社华盛顿讯）
