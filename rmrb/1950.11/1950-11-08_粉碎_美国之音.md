　　Smash the "Voice of America"
    During the mass movement to resist America and aid Korea, the famous play "Voice of America," which won the Stalin Prize, is being staged in many places. The Northeast Daily answered readers' questions about "What kind of radio station is 'Voice of America'? Who runs it? What is its political background?" Many local newspapers have reprinted it.
    In answering readers' questions, the Northeast Daily pointed out that while American imperialism is expanding the US military budget, it is also expanding the power of the "Voice of America" radio station; while formulating the aggressive "overall diplomacy" plan, it is also formulating the "overall radio propaganda plan." The "Voice of America" is an inseparable part of the entire American imperialist aggressive apparatus. It is the world's largest rumor mill, specializing in using radio waves to spread various rumors. Recently, during the meeting between Truman and MacArthur on Wake Island in the Pacific, they once again planned to strengthen the work of the "Voice of America" in order to spread a large number of rumors while carrying out armed aggression against the people of the East, attempting to disrupt the thinking of the masses.
    There are still a very small number of people in our country who often listen to the "Voice of America." The "Voice of America" often becomes the basis for special agents and bandits to spread rumors. In order to smash the reactionary propaganda of the "Voice of America," it is a meaningful task to carry out appropriate exposure and propaganda in newspapers, forming a moral pressure not to listen to the "Voice of America."

### 粉碎“美国之音”

　　粉碎“美国之音”
    在抗美援朝的群众运动中，有许多地方在上演获得斯大林奖金的著名剧本《美国之音》。东北日报答复了读者关于“‘美国之音’是什么样的广播电台？由谁主办？它的政治背景怎样？”的问题。许多地方的报纸曾加以转载。
    东北日报在答读者问中指出：美国帝国主义与扩大美国军事预算同时，扩充“美国之音”广播电台的电力；与制订侵略的“总体外交”计划同时，还制定了“总体无线电宣传计划”。“美国之音”是美帝整个侵略机构中不可分的一部分，是世界上最大的谣言公司，专门利用电波来传播各种谣言。最近杜鲁门与麦克阿瑟在太平洋威克岛的会谈中，又一次策划着要加强“美国之音”的工作，以便在武装侵略东方人民的同时，大量传播谣言，企图对群众思想加以扰乱。
    我们国家中还有极少一部分人时常收听“美国之音”。“美国之音”并常成为特务匪徒传播谣言的根据。为了粉碎“美国之音”的反动宣传，在报纸上进行适当的揭发性的宣传，形成一种不收听“美国之音”的道义的压力，是一个有意义的工作。
