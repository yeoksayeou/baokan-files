　　Seventy-Seven Medical Workers in the Capital
    Form First Volunteer Medical Surgical Team to Korea
    Farewell Rally Held Yesterday at Xiangshan Ciyouyuan
    Chinese Medical Association Decides to Organize Training Classes on War Trauma Surgery
    [This newspaper reported] The first volunteer medical surgical team to Korea has been formed by medical workers in the capital. Yesterday (the 23rd), relevant departments held a farewell rally at Xiangshan Ciyouyuan. The surgical team consists of seventy-seven people, including medical staff, nurses, and other workers. The team is composed of four units: the Central People's Hospital, the North China People's Hospital, the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau, and Peking University Medical College. In his opening remarks, President Hu of Peking University Medical College first stated that this mission is extremely glorious. He hoped that the team members would unite closely with other teams in the future to better complete the task. He said: We, the personnel remaining in the rear, will work doubly hard and take on the work you have not finished. Professor Chen Jingyun of Peking University Medical College said in his reply: Through current affairs study, we have learned about the righteousness of resisting America and aiding Korea. I feel that the glory belongs to the people. Comrades in the rear are equally glorious. We will do our utmost to successfully complete the task. The surgical team's medical focus is mainly on surgery, with special attention to orthopedics and general surgery. After American bandit planes bombed and injured driver Xu Guochen at Linjiang Station, Professor Chen Jingyun indignantly wrote a letter to Xu Guochen, saying: "I heard that your left hand was broken by American planes, and I am very angry. I am willing to treat you and turn your left hand into a good hand that can do all kinds of work and avenge you!" This time, he excitedly participated in the "surgical team" and said in the first "War Trauma Surgery" class: "During the Liberation War, when the soldiers heard that Dr. Bethune was behind them, they would say: 'Charge forward, don't be afraid, if we get injured, there's Dr. Bethune.' The brave soldiers are the ones who directly kill the enemy at the front, and the medical workers are the ones who save the lives of the wounded."
    [Furthermore, it is reported] Teachers, students, doctors, and nurses from Peking University Medical College and Peking University Hospital actively prepared for the farewell to the surgical team members in the past few days. Many people rushed to make comfort bags and write letters of sympathy, asking the surgical team to take them to the Korean People's Army and our volunteer troops in Korea.
    [Furthermore, it is reported] In order to meet the current needs, Peking University Medical College has started and is preparing to open several extracurricular training classes. The "War Trauma Surgery" class has already started and is expected to be completed in two months. In addition, similar classes will also be opened for lower-grade medical students, nursing students, other first-aid training classes, and pre-medical students from the School of Science. The Department of Pharmacy also has a "Wartime Pharmacist" course at the same time.
    [Furthermore, it is reported] The Beijing Chinese Medical Association has decided to mobilize medical workers to intensify their political and professional studies. In terms of professional skills, in coordination with the Medical Association, the Women's Federation, and the Red Cross Society to discuss specific learning steps, it has been decided to organize two training classes, one for "War Trauma Surgery," mainly for surgeons with a foundation, and the other for "Wartime First Aid," to absorb general medical workers and citizens to participate.

　　首都医务工作者七十七人
    组成首批志愿赴朝医疗手术队
    昨在香山慈幼院举行欢送大会
    中华医学会决办战伤外科等训练班
    【本报讯】首都医务工作者已组成首批志愿赴朝医疗手术队。昨（二十三）日有关部门假香山慈幼院举行欢送大会。手术队共七十七人，包括医、护人员及其他工作人员。组成单位为：中央人民医院、华北人民医院、京市卫生局及北大医学院等四个单位。北大医学院胡院长致开会词中，首先说明：这个任务是极其光荣的。他希望队员将来与其他队紧密团结，以更好地完成任务。他说：我们留下在后方的人员，一定加倍努力工作，且要承担起你们未完成的工作。北大医学院陈景云教授在致答词中说：我们经过时事学习，了解到抗美援朝的正义性。我觉得光荣是人民的。后方同志也同样光荣。我们一定尽一切力量胜利完成任务。该手术队医疗方面以外科为主，特别注意外科中的骨科与普通外科两方面。陈景云教授在美国强盗飞机炸伤临江车站司机徐国臣后，曾义愤填膺地写了一封信给徐国臣说：“我听说你的左手被美机打断了，我非常愤怒。我愿意替你医治，让你的左手变成一只好手，能做一切工作，替你复仇！”这次他兴奋的参加了“手术队”，并在第一堂“战伤外科”课上说：“在解放战争中，战士们听到白求恩大夫在后面时就说：‘向前冲，不怕，受了伤有白大夫。’在前方直接杀死敌人的是我们英勇的战士，救护伤员生命的是我们医务工作者。”
    【又讯】北大医学院及北大医院的先生、同学、医生、护士等早在前几天就积极筹备欢送参加手术队人员，很多人并赶制慰问袋，写慰问信，请赴朝手术队带给朝鲜人民军暨我赴朝志愿部队。
    【又讯】北大医学院为适应当前需要，已着手及正准备开几个课外的训练班。“战伤外科”已开班，预计两个月内教完。此外，对低年级的医学生、护士学生、其他急救训练班和理学院的预科学生，也将开类此班次。药学系也同时有“战地司药”的课目。
    【又讯】北京中华医学会决定发动医务工作者加紧政治及业务的学习。业务方面，配合医联、妇联、红十字会商讨具体学习步骤，决定办两个训练班，一个“战伤外科”，以有基础的外科医师为主，另外一个为“战地救护”，吸收一般医务工作者及市民参加。
