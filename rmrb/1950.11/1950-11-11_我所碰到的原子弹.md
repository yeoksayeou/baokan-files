　　The Atomic Bomb I Encountered
　　By You Mingzhe
　　Since the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Hiroshima has become one of the world's most famous cities. It was originally an industrial city in southern Japan, facing the sea to the south, not far from the famous naval ports of Wu and Kure. The city's industry and commerce were developed, and it was the cultural center of southern Honshu. Hiroshima University of Literature and Science was located in the city center. In 1945, I was studying physics at this university.
　　From the start of the Pacific War in 1941 until the end of July 1945, American planes bombed major Japanese cities one after another, but Hiroshima did not suffer serious damage. At that time, it could be considered the only fortunate city in Japan. At 9:00 p.m. on August 5, 1945, American planes bombed Kure Harbor. Until 5:00 a.m. on the 6th, the air raid alert in Hiroshima City was not lifted all night, and the citizens stayed up all night. We Chinese students also talked all night in the air raid shelter, not only unafraid, but feeling that the bombing was justified. Because it was Japan that was being bombed, and Japanese imperialism was our enemy.
　　After breakfast on August 6th, another alert was issued. I arrived at school from my residence at 7:30 a.m. At this time, the alert was lifted, and I immediately went to the laboratory to experiment with X-ray crystal photography. At about 8:15, I suddenly saw a flash of light, and I thought the lead wire of the electric box had broken. Just as I was about to check, I heard a "dong" sound, and I unconsciously fell to the floor. When I got up, the room was filled with flying dust, and my vision was blurred. I could only hear shouting in the corridor. I groped my way out of the room in the hazy smoke and went into the air raid shelter. Looking out, I saw that the clear sky when I came today had turned pale yellow. At this time, a Japanese classmate also came in. I saw that he was bleeding, and looking back at myself, I realized that my shirt was also wet from bleeding skin. So I wanted to go back to my residence. I walked out of the air raid shelter and onto the street, where I saw houses collapsing and many injured people. I couldn't care about that at this time, and ran east for more than ten kilometers. At about 12:00, I arrived at a school outside the city. This place had been temporarily set up as a temporary relief center. I felt that it was just skin bleeding, so I didn't go for treatment. So I left here and walked east again, to a person's house on the mountain to stay.
　　At that time, most people didn't know that it was an atomic bomb explosion, but they felt that it was different from ordinary bombs. Japanese newspapers called it a new type of bomb, and the locals called it "Pika-don," meaning "a flash of light and a dong sound." Later, I learned that it was an atomic bomb made of uranium atoms, weighing about four tons, of which uranium was only about one kilogram, with an explosive force of about 2,000 tons of gunpowder. It was dropped on a parachute and exploded in the air hundreds of meters above the ground. The destructive power was emitted by the light, heat, and vibration of radiation. Before the bombing, the weather was clear and pleasant. After the bombing, the sky was pale yellow, and it rained two hours later. It is said that the effectiveness of the radiation lasted for a week. The range affected by this atomic bomb was within a circle with a radius of about five kilometers, and the destructive power decreased with distance from the epicenter. Most of those who died directly from light and heat burns were outdoors, and those who were crushed indirectly indoors were secondary. In addition, there were also people who came to help from outside the city after the explosion who died from radiation.
　　Before the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, because there was no alert, most of the citizens did not go to the air raid shelters and were working indoors as usual. On this day, many schools and villagers from outside the city also came to the city. Japanese buildings are also very unstable, most of them are wooden houses. The streets are narrow, and the citizens have no air defense experience. This is the reason for the losses.
　　When the atomic bomb was dropped, I was in a building at Hiroshima University of Literature and Science, one kilometer from the epicenter. I was not directly exposed to radiation, but was injured and knocked down by broken glass. I only felt tired and weak for two weeks. Five months later, the doctor examined me and found that my white blood cells were only slightly reduced. After injecting vitamin C and hormones more than ten times, my health was completely restored.
　　Since the atomic bomb caused the world's surprise and attention, American imperialism has vigorously promoted and threatened the world. It is even rumored that in places bombed by atomic bombs, no grass grows and people cannot reproduce. However, the facts I have seen with my own eyes are not like this. In the area bombed in Hiroshima, grass sprouted on the ground a month later. My classmate Zhu Dingyu, who was with me at the time, was injured even more seriously than I was. He had a fat boy last year (1949). These facts prove that the absurd rumors and threats of American imperialism are not worth refuting. Moreover, if you enter a solid air raid shelter before the atomic bomb is dropped, wear white clothes, and immediately run to a place ten kilometers away from the epicenter to rest after the drop, you can be safe and sound. I am an experienced person under the atomic bomb. Now I have returned to my motherland and am studying vigorously. From this, it can be seen that the atomic bomb is not as terrible as American imperialism boasts.

### 我所碰到的原子弹

　　我所碰到的原子弹
    由明哲
    自从原子弹投在广岛以后，广岛变成世界闻名都市之一。它本来是日本南部的一个工业城市，南面临海，和著名的吴、广两军港，相距不远。市内工商业发达，是本州南部的文化中心，广岛文理科大学就设立在市的中心区。一九四五年，我就在这个大学学习物理。
    自从一九四一年太平洋战争开始，到一九四五年七月底止，美机曾先后轰炸日本各大都市，可是广岛并没有遭到严重的损害，当时可算做日本唯一幸福的都市。一九四五年八月五日下午九时，美机轰炸吴港，直到六日午前五时，广岛市彻夜空袭警报未除，市民通宵未眠。我们中国留学生也在防空壕内畅谈了一夜，不但不怕，反觉得炸的应该。因为被炸的是日本，日本帝国主义是我们的敌人。
    八月六日早饭后又发出警戒警报。我从住处到学校，已是七点半钟。这时警报解除，我即到实验室中实验Ｘ光线结晶照像。八时十五分左右，忽见光线一闪，我以为是电盒的铅丝断了。正待查看，只听冬的一声，我不知不觉地仆倒在地板上。爬起一看，满室尘土飞扬，视线不清，只听得廊下有喊叫的声音。我在烟尘迷蒙中摸索着跑出室外，走进防空壕，往外一看，原来今天来时的晴爽天空，现在已变成淡黄色。这时有一日本同学也进来了。我看他身上出血，回头看看自己，才知道我的衬衫也因皮肤出血而湿了。于是想回到住处去。走出防空壕，到街上，看见房屋坍塌，有许多受伤的人。我这时顾不得这许多，一直往东跑，跑了十几公里。十二时许到市外一个学校。此地已暂设为临时救济所。我觉得只是皮肤出血，没有去医治。于是离此又往东走，到山上一个人家里住下。
    当时一般人还不知道这就是原子弹爆炸，但总觉得和普通炸弹不同。日本报上称作新型炸弹，当地人将它称作“皮卡冬”，意思是“光一闪冬一声”。后来才知道是用铀原子做成的原子弹，重量大约有四吨，其中铀不过一公斤左右，约有火药二千吨的爆破力，投下时是系在降落伞上，在离地面数百公尺的空中爆发的。因放射线的光、热和震动，发出破坏力。投弹以前，天气晴爽，以后天空淡、黄，二小时后下一阵雨。据说放射线的效能延续到一周。这颗原子弹波及的范围，约在半径五公里圆周内，破坏力和爆心愈远愈小。在室外直接因光热烧死的居多，在室内间接压死的居次。另外在爆炸后市外来救助的人员因放射线而死的也有。
    广岛在投弹以前因无警报，市民普遍的都没到防空壕里去，照常的在室内工作着。这天市外的学校和村民来市内的也很多。日本建筑物又非常不牢固，大多数是木板房屋。街道狭小，市民没有防空经验，这是吃亏的原因。
    原子弹投下时，我正在文理科大学一间楼房内，离爆心一公里，没有直接受到照射，因玻璃破片击伤震倒。仅在二周以内感觉疲乏无力。五个月后，医生检查，白血球仅稍为减少。经注射维他命丙和荷尔蒙十几次，健康就完全恢复了。
    自从原子弹引起世界人们的惊讶与注意后，美帝即大肆宣传，恐吓世人。更谣传经过原子弹轰炸的地方，草木不生，人不生育。然而我亲眼看到的事实并非如此。广岛被炸的地方，一月后地上草又出了芽，我的同学朱定裕，当时和我在一处，比我受伤还重。他在去年（一九四九）生了一个肥胖的男孩。这些事实证明美帝的无稽造谣和恐吓，都是不值一驳。况且若在原子弹投下前，进到坚固的防空壕内，身穿白衣，投下后立刻跑到爆心十公里以外休息，就可安然无事。我是原子弹下的经验者，现在已经回到祖国，在健壮的学习。由此可见，原子弹并不像美帝吹嘘的那样可怕。
