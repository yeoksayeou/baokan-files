Rural Party Member Training Class in Hengshui County
    Overcomes Ideas of Worshipping, Fearing, and Being Numb to the U.S., Resolves to Do Good Work and Resist America, Aid Korea
    [Our Newspaper] The students in the rural Party member training class in Hengshui County, Hebei Province, resolved some confused ideas about the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and armed their minds while studying current events. They unanimously expressed that after returning to the village, they would carry out good publicity and work actively, to resist America, aid Korea, and defend their homes and country with practical actions.

    The first phase of training for the county's rural Party and Youth League cadres began on November 16th, with a total of 251 participants. Because the county and districts did not carry out enough current affairs publicity and education in rural areas, many people harbored ideas of worshipping, fearing, and being numb to the U.S.

    In response to the ideological situation of the students, Zhao Hui, Secretary of the CPC County Committee, gave a report on the current situation on the 23rd. After the report, 130 people bought "Current Affairs Manuals" on the same day. At the same time, a heated discussion unfolded in the groups. During the discussion, the ideological understanding of the students generally improved. They expressed their hatred, contempt, and disdain for U.S. imperialism. They unanimously believed that the U.S. imperialist aggression against Korea was like a robber setting fire to our neighbor's house. If we don't go to rescue, it will burn our own heads. Only by organizing ourselves, going to put out the fire, and fighting the robbers can we protect our own safety. Wang Bingwen said, "The U.S. emperor thinks he can scare us farmers with atomic bombs. But victory or defeat doesn't depend on atomic bombs, it still depends on people being useful." Qiao Dianzhi said, "Before I came, I heard that the U.S. emperor was invading Korea, and I didn't feel like working. After this study, I realized that only by doing good work can we have the power to stop the war of aggression. After I return to the village, I will not only organize sideline production (weaving baskets and mats) well, but also develop it on a large scale." Liu Zhenliang, the director of a village militia committee, said, "I will definitely reorganize the militia when I go back and prepare to fight the wolves with wild ambitions!"

    In the end, all 251 students unanimously expressed that they would earnestly overcome commandism and apathy in the training, and after returning to the village, they would actively work, step up publicity, educate the masses, expose rumors, follow the mass line, and lead the masses to do a good job in winter sideline production.

　　衡水县农村党员整训班学员
    克服崇美恐美麻痹思想  决心做好工作抗美援朝
    【本报讯】河北省衡水县农村党员整训班学员在学习时事中，解决了一些关于抗美援朝运动的糊涂思想，武装了头脑。一致表示回村后要好好宣传，积极工作，以实际行动来抗美援朝，保家卫国。
    十一月十六日开始整训的该县第一期农村党、团员干部共二百五十一人。因县区对农村进行时事宣传教育不够，不少人都存有崇美、恐美和麻痹思想。
    针对学员们的思想情况，二十三日中共县委书记赵辉作了目前形势的报告。报告后，当天就有一百三十人自己买了“时事手册”。同时在组里展开了热烈的讨论。在讨论中，学员思想认识普遍提高了一步。纷纷表示了对美帝国主义的仇视、蔑视和鄙视。一致认为：美帝侵略朝鲜，好比强盗在咱们邻居放上了火。如果我们不去救，就会烧到自己头上。只有组织起来，去救火，去打强盗，才能保住自家安全。王丙文说：“美帝就觉得它有原子弹来吓唬咱庄稼人。但是胜败不在原子弹，还是人中用。”乔殿智说：“我来以前，听说美帝侵略朝鲜，做着工作也不带劲了。这么一学习，我才明白只有做好工作，才能有力量制止侵略战争。我回村后，不但要把副业（编篓席）组织好，并要向大处发展。”一个村武委会主任刘振亮说：“我回去一定把民兵整顿好，准备打野心狼！”
    最后，二百五十一名学员一致表示，要在整训中认真克服命令主义和麻痹思想，回村后要积极工作，加紧宣传，教育群众，揭破谣言，走群众路线，领导群众搞好冬季副业生产。
