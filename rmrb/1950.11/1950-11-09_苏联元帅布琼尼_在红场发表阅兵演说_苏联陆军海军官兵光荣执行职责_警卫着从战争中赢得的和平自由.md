Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th. According to TASS, during the military parade in Moscow's Red Square on the 7th, Soviet Marshal Budyonny gave a speech stating that the Soviet people have won a decisive victory in the struggle to victoriously complete the post-war Five-Year Plan. The achievements of the Soviet people are an encouraging force for the people of all countries who are building socialism. All sectors of the Soviet national economy have developed, the material well-being of the people has improved, the spiritual and political unity of Soviet society has been consolidated, the friendship between all nationalities has been strengthened, and Soviet patriotism has been expressed more vividly. All this should be attributed to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the great Stalin.

Marshal Budyonny pointed out that American and British imperialists are taking direct acts of aggression. The Soviet Union and all freedom-loving people around the world are angrily condemning the American aggression against Korea, and expressing sympathy to the Korean people who are bravely fighting for the freedom and independence of their motherland. Stalin's wise policy of peace has won the enthusiastic support of the people all over the world.

Marshal Budyonny continued: The Soviet people are full of determination to continue to strengthen the power of the motherland with heroic labor. The officers and soldiers of the Soviet Army and Navy are gloriously fulfilling their duties, defending the interests of the country and the peace won from the war, guarding the borders of the motherland and the constructive labor of the Soviet people. The people can believe that the Soviet Army and Navy will continue to be loyal guardians of the freedom and independence of the socialist motherland.
